I
be
bear
in
the
year
1632
,
in
the
city
of
York
,
of
a
good
family
,
though
not
of
that
country
,
my
father
be
a
foreigner
of
Bremen
,
who
settle
first
at
Hull
<EOS>
:
he
get
a
good
estate
by
merchandise
,
and
leave
off
his
trade
,
live
afterwards
at
York
,
from
whence
he
have
marry
my
mother
,
whose
relation
be
name
Robinson
,
a
very
good
family
in
that
country
,
and
from
whom
I
be
call
Robinson
Kreutznaer
;
but
by
the
usual
corruption
of
word
in
England
,
we
be
now
call
,
nay
we
call
ourselves
,
and
write
our
name
Crusoe
,
and
so
my
companion
always
call
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
two
elder
brother
,
one
of
which
be
lieutenant
-
colonel
to
an
english
regiment
of
foot
in
Flanders
,
formerly
command
by
the
famous
Colonel
Lockhart
,
and
be
kill
at
the
battle
near
Dunkirk
against
the
Spaniards
.
<EOS>
what
become
of
my
second
brother
I
never
know
,
any
more
than
my
father
or
mother
do
know
what
be
become
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
be
the
third
son
of
the
family
,
and
not
breed
to
any
trade
,
my
head
begin
to
be
fill
very
early
with
ramble
thought
:
my
father
,
who
be
very
ancient
,
have
give
me
a
competent
share
of
learning
,
as
far
as
house
education
and
a
country
free
-
school
generally
go
,
and
design
me
for
the
law
;
but
I
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
go
to
sea
;
and
my
inclination
to
this
lead
me
so
strongly
against
the
will
,
nay
the
command
of
my
father
,
and
against
all
the
entreaty
and
persuasion
of
my
mother
and
other
friend
,
that
there
seem
to
be
something
fatal
in
that
propension
of
nature
tend
directly
to
the
life
of
misery
which
be
to
befal
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
a
wise
and
grave
man
,
give
me
serious
and
excellent
counsel
against
what
he
foresaw
be
my
design
.
<EOS>
He
call
me
one
morning
into
his
chamber
,
where
he
be
confine
by
the
gout
,
and
expostulate
very
warmly
with
me
upon
this
subject
:
he
ask
me
what
reason
more
than
a
mere
wander
inclination
I
have
for
leave
my
father
's
house
and
my
native
country
,
where
I
may
be
well
introduce
,
and
have
a
prospect
of
raise
my
fortune
by
application
and
industry
,
with
a
life
of
ease
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
it
be
for
man
of
desperate
fortune
on
one
hand
,
or
of
aspire
superior
fortune
on
the
other
,
who
go
abroad
upon
adventure
,
to
rise
by
enterprise
,
and
make
themselves
famous
in
undertaking
of
a
nature
out
of
the
common
road
;
that
these
thing
be
all
either
too
far
above
me
,
or
too
far
below
me
;
that
mine
be
the
middle
state
,
or
what
may
be
call
the
upper
station
of
low
life
,
which
he
have
find
by
long
experience
be
the
good
state
in
the
world
,
the
most
suited
to
human
happiness
,
not
expose
to
the
misery
and
hardship
,
the
labour
and
suffering
of
the
mechanic
part
of
mankind
,
and
not
embarrassed
with
the
pride
,
luxury
,
ambition
,
and
envy
of
the
upper
part
of
mankind
,
he
tell
me
,
I
may
judge
of
the
happiness
of
this
state
by
this
one
thing
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
this
be
the
state
of
life
which
all
other
people
envy
;
that
king
have
frequently
lament
the
miserable
consequence
of
be
bear
to
great
thing
,
and
wish
they
have
be
place
in
the
middle
of
the
two
extreme
,
between
the
mean
and
the
great
;
that
the
wise
man
give
his
testimony
to
this
as
the
just
standard
of
true
felicity
,
when
he
pray
to
have
neither
poverty
nor
rich
.
  
<EOS>
He
bid
me
observe
it
,
and
I
should
always
find
,
that
the
calamity
of
life
be
share
among
the
upper
and
low
part
of
mankind
;
but
that
the
middle
station
have
the
few
disaster
,
and
be
not
expose
to
so
many
vicissitude
as
the
high
or
low
part
of
mankind
;
<EOS>
nay
,
they
be
not
subject
to
so
many
distemper
and
uneasiness
,
either
of
body
or
mind
,
as
those
be
,
who
by
vicious
living
,
luxury
,
and
extravagance
,
on
one
hand
,
or
by
hard
labour
,
want
of
necessary
,
and
mean
or
insufficient
diet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
bring
distemper
upon
themselves
by
the
natural
consequence
of
their
way
of
living
;
that
the
middle
station
of
life
be
calculate
for
all
kind
of
virtue
and
all
kind
of
enjoyment
;
that
peace
and
plenty
be
the
handmaid
of
a
middle
fortune
;
that
temperance
,
moderation
,
quietness
,
health
,
society
,
all
agreeable
diversion
,
and
all
desirable
pleasure
,
be
the
blessing
attend
the
middle
station
of
life
;
that
this
way
man
go
silently
and
smoothly
through
the
world
,
and
comfortably
out
of
it
,
not
embarrassed
with
the
labour
of
the
hand
or
of
the
head
,
not
sell
to
the
life
of
slavery
for
daily
bread
,
or
harass
with
perplex
circumstance
,
which
rob
the
soul
of
peace
,
and
the
body
of
rest
;
not
enrage
with
the
passion
of
envy
,
or
secret
burn
lust
of
ambition
for
great
thing
;
but
in
easy
circumstance
slide
gently
through
the
world
,
and
sensibly
taste
the
sweet
of
living
,
without
the
bitter
,
feel
that
they
be
happy
,
and
learn
by
every
day
's
experience
to
know
it
more
sensibly
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
press
me
earnestly
,
and
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
not
to
play
the
young
man
,
not
to
precipitate
myself
into
misery
which
nature
and
the
station
of
life
<EOS>
I
be
bear
in
seem
to
have
provide
against
;
that
I
be
under
no
necessity
of
seek
my
bread
;
that
he
would
do
well
for
me
,
and
endeavour
to
enter
me
fairly
into
the
station
of
life
which
he
have
be
just
recommend
to
me
;
and
that
if
I
be
not
very
easy
and
happy
in
the
world
,
it
must
be
my
mere
fate
or
fault
that
must
hinder
it
,
and
that
he
should
have
nothing
to
answer
for
,
have
thus
discharge
his
duty
in
warn
me
against
measure
which
he
know
would
be
to
my
hurt
:
in
a
word
,
that
as
he
would
do
very
kind
thing
for
me
if
I
would
stay
and
settle
at
home
as
he
direct
,
so
he
would
not
have
so
much
hand
in
my
misfortune
,
as
to
give
me
any
encouragement
to
go
away
:
and
to
close
all
,
he
tell
me
I
have
my
eld
brother
for
an
example
,
to
whom
he
have
use
the
same
earnest
persuasion
to
keep
him
from
go
into
the
Low
Country
war
,
but
could
not
prevail
,
his
young
desire
prompt
him
to
run
into
the
army
,
where
he
be
kill
;
and
though
he
say
he
would
not
cease
to
pray
for
me
,
yet
he
would
venture
to
say
to
me
,
that
if
I
do
take
this
foolish
step
,
God
would
not
bless
me
,
and
I
would
have
leisure
hereafter
to
reflect
upon
have
neglect
his
counsel
when
there
may
be
none
to
assist
in
my
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
in
this
last
part
of
his
discourse
,
which
be
truly
prophetic
,
though
I
suppose
my
father
do
not
know
it
to
be
so
himself
;
I
say
,
I
observe
the
tear
run
down
his
face
very
plentifully
,
and
especially
when
he
speak
of
my
brother
who
be
kill
;
and
that
when
he
speak
of
my
have
leisure
to
repent
,
and
none
to
assist
me
,
he
be
so
moved
,
that
he
break
off
the
discourse
,
and
tell
me
,
his
heart
be
so
full
he
could
say
no
more
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sincerely
affected
with
this
discourse
,
as
indeed
who
could
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
and
I
resolve
not
to
think
of
go
abroad
any
more
,
but
to
settle
at
home
accord
to
my
father
's
desire
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
a
few
day
wear
it
all
off
;
and
in
short
,
to
prevent
any
of
my
father
's
farth
importunity
,
in
a
few
week
after
I
resolve
to
run
quite
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
act
so
hastily
neither
as
my
first
heat
of
resolution
prompt
,
but
I
take
my
mother
,
at
a
time
when
I
think
her
a
little
pleasanter
than
ordinary
,
and
tell
her
,
that
my
thought
be
so
entirely
bent
upon
see
the
world
,
that
I
should
never
settle
to
any
thing
with
resolution
enough
to
go
through
with
it
,
and
my
father
have
better
give
me
his
consent
than
force
me
to
go
without
it
;
that
I
be
now
eighteen
year
old
,
which
be
too
late
to
go
apprentice
to
a
trade
,
or
clerk
to
an
attorney
;
that
I
be
sure
,
if
I
do
,
I
should
never
serve
out
my
time
,
and
I
should
certainly
run
away
from
my
master
before
my
time
be
out
,
and
go
to
sea
;
and
if
she
would
speak
to
my
father
to
let
me
go
one
voyage
abroad
,
if
I
come
home
again
,
and
do
not
like
it
,
I
would
go
no
more
,
and
I
would
promise
by
a
double
diligence
to
recover
that
time
I
have
lose
.
  
<EOS>
this
put
my
mother
into
a
great
passion
:
she
tell
me
,
she
know
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
speak
to
my
father
upon
any
such
subject
;
that
he
know
too
well
<EOS>
what
be
my
interest
to
give
his
consent
to
any
such
thing
so
much
for
my
hurt
;
and
that
she
wonder
how
I
could
think
of
any
such
thing
after
such
a
discourse
as
I
have
have
with
my
father
,
and
such
kind
and
tender
expression
as
she
know
my
father
have
use
to
me
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
if
I
would
ruin
myself
,
there
be
no
help
for
me
;
but
I
may
depend
I
should
never
have
their
consent
to
it
:
that
for
her
part
she
would
not
have
so
much
hand
in
my
destruction
;
and
I
should
never
have
it
to
say
,
that
my
mother
be
willing
when
my
father
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
though
my
mother
refuse
to
move
it
to
my
father
,
yet
,
as
I
have
hear
afterwards
,
she
report
all
the
discourse
to
him
,
and
that
my
father
,
after
shew
a
great
concern
at
it
,
say
to
her
with
a
sigh
,
"
that
boy
may
be
happy
if
he
would
stay
at
home
;
but
if
he
go
abroad
,
he
will
be
the
most
miserable
wretch
that
be
ever
bear
;
I
can
give
no
consent
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
almost
a
year
after
this
that
I
break
loose
,
though
,
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
continue
obstinately
deaf
to
all
proposal
of
settle
to
business
,
and
frequently
expostulate
with
my
father
and
mother
about
their
be
so
positively
determined
against
what
they
know
my
inclination
prompt
me
to
.
<EOS>
but
be
one
day
at
Hull
,
where
I
go
casually
,
and
without
any
purpose
of
make
an
elopement
that
time
;
but
I
say
,
be
there
,
and
one
of
my
companion
be
go
by
sea
to
London
,
in
his
father
's
ship
,
and
prompt
me
to
go
with
them
,
with
the
common
allurement
of
seafare
man
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
it
should
cost
me
nothing
for
my
passage
,
I
consult
neither
father
or
mother
any
more
,
not
so
much
as
send
them
word
of
it
;
but
leave
them
to
hear
of
it
as
they
may
,
without
ask
God
's
blessing
,
or
my
father
's
,
without
any
consideration
of
circumstance
or
consequence
,
and
in
an
ill
hour
,
God
know
,
on
the
first
of
September
,
1651
<EOS>
,
I
go
on
board
a
ship
bind
for
London
.
<EOS>
never
any
young
adventurer
's
misfortune
,
I
believe
,
begin
sooner
,
or
continue
longer
than
mine
.
<EOS>
the
ship
be
no
sooner
get
out
of
the
Humber
,
but
the
wind
begin
to
blow
,
and
the
wave
to
rise
in
a
most
frightful
manner
;
and
,
as
I
have
never
be
at
sea
before
,
I
be
most
inexpressibly
sick
in
body
,
and
terrify
in
mind
.
<EOS>
I
begin
now
seriously
to
reflect
upon
what
I
have
do
,
and
how
justly
I
be
overtake
by
the
judgment
of
Heaven
for
my
wicked
leave
my
father
's
house
,
and
abandon
my
duty
;
all
the
good
counsel
of
my
parent
,
my
father
's
tear
and
my
mother
's
entreaty
,
come
now
fresh
into
my
mind
;
and
my
conscience
,
which
be
not
yet
come
to
the
pitch
of
hardness
to
which
it
have
be
since
,
reproach
me
with
the
contempt
of
advice
,
and
the
breach
of
my
duty
to
God
and
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
the
storm
increase
,
and
the
sea
,
which
I
have
never
be
upon
before
,
go
very
high
,
though
nothing
like
what
I
have
see
many
time
since
;
no
,
nor
like
what
I
see
a
few
day
after
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
enough
to
affect
me
then
,
<EOS>
who
be
but
a
young
sailor
,
and
have
never
know
any
thing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
expect
every
wave
would
have
swallow
us
up
,
and
that
every
time
the
ship
fall
down
,
as
I
think
,
in
the
trough
or
hollow
of
the
sea
,
we
should
never
rise
more
;
and
in
this
agony
of
mind
I
make
many
vow
and
resolution
,
that
if
it
would
please
God
here
to
spare
my
life
this
one
voyage
,
if
ever
I
get
once
my
foot
upon
dry
land
again
I
would
go
directly
home
to
my
father
,
and
never
set
it
into
a
ship
again
while
I
live
;
that
I
would
take
his
advice
,
and
never
run
myself
into
such
misery
as
these
any
more
.
<EOS>
now
I
see
plainly
the
goodness
of
his
observation
about
the
middle
station
of
life
,
how
easy
,
how
comfortably
he
have
live
all
his
day
,
and
never
have
be
expose
to
tempest
at
sea
,
or
trouble
on
shore
;
and
I
resolve
that
I
would
,
like
a
true
repent
prodigal
,
go
home
to
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
these
wise
and
sober
thought
continue
all
the
while
the
storm
continue
,
and
indeed
some
time
after
;
but
the
next
day
the
wind
be
abate
,
and
the
sea
calmer
,
and
I
begin
to
be
a
little
inure
to
it
:
however
,
I
be
very
grave
for
all
that
day
,
be
also
a
little
sea
-
sick
still
;
but
towards
night
the
weather
clear
up
,
the
wind
be
quite
over
,
and
a
charming
fine
evening
follow
;
the
sun
go
down
perfectly
clear
,
and
rise
so
the
next
morning
;
and
have
little
or
no
wind
,
and
a
smooth
sea
,
the
sun
shine
upon
it
,
the
sight
be
,
as
I
think
,
the
most
delightful
that
ever
I
see
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sleep
well
in
the
night
,
and
be
now
no
more
sea
-
sick
,
but
very
cheerful
,
look
with
wonder
upon
the
sea
that
be
so
rough
and
terrible
the
day
before
,
and
could
be
so
calm
and
so
pleasant
in
so
little
time
after
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
lest
my
good
resolution
should
continue
,
my
companion
,
who
have
indeed
entice
me
away
,
come
to
me
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
Bob
,
"
say
he
,
(
clap
me
upon
the
shoulder
)
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
after
it
?
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
be
fright
,
wa'n't
you
,
last
night
,
when
it
blow
but
a
capful
of
wind
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
capful
do
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
;
"
it
be
a
terrible
storm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
storm
you
fool
you
,
"
reply
he
,
"
do
you
call
that
a
storm
?
<EOS>
why
it
be
nothing
at
all
;
give
us
but
a
good
ship
and
sea
-
room
,
and
we
think
nothing
of
such
a
squall
of
wind
as
that
;
but
you
be
but
a
fresh
-
water
sailor
,
Bob
.
<EOS>
come
,
let
us
make
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
we
will
forget
all
that
;
do
you
see
what
charming
weather
it
be
now
?
"
<EOS>
to
make
short
this
sad
part
of
my
story
,
we
go
the
old
way
of
all
sailor
;
the
punch
be
make
,
and
I
be
make
drunk
with
it
;
and
in
that
one
night
's
wickedness
I
drown
all
my
repentance
,
all
my
reflection
upon
my
past
conduct
,
and
all
my
resolution
for
my
future
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
as
the
sea
be
return
to
its
smoothness
of
surface
and
settle
calmness
by
the
abatement
of
that
storm
,
so
the
hurry
of
my
thought
be
over
,
my
fear
and
apprehension
of
be
swallow
up
by
the
sea
be
forget
,
and
the
current
of
my
former
desire
return
,
I
entirely
forget
the
vow
and
promise
that
I
make
in
my
distress
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
indeed
,
some
interval
of
reflection
,
and
the
serious
thought
do
,
as
it
be
,
endeavour
to
return
again
sometimes
;
but
I
shake
them
off
,
and
rouse
myself
from
them
as
it
be
from
a
distemper
,
and
apply
myself
to
drinking
and
company
,
soon
master
the
return
of
those
fit
,
for
<EOS>
so
I
call
them
;
and
<EOS>
I
have
in
five
or
six
day
get
as
complete
a
victory
over
conscience
,
as
any
young
fellow
that
resolve
not
to
be
trouble
with
it
could
desire
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
to
have
another
trial
for
it
still
;
and
Providence
,
as
in
such
case
generally
it
do
,
resolve
to
leave
me
entirely
without
excuse
:
for
if
I
would
not
take
this
for
a
deliverance
,
the
next
be
to
be
such
a
one
as
the
bad
and
most
hardened
wretch
among
us
would
confess
both
the
danger
and
the
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
the
sixth
day
of
our
being
at
sea
we
come
into
Yarmouth
Roads
;
the
wind
have
be
contrary
,
and
the
weather
calm
,
we
have
make
but
<EOS>
little
way
since
the
storm
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
oblige
to
come
to
anchor
,
and
here
we
lay
,
the
wind
continue
contrary
,
viz
.
<EOS>
at
south
-
west
,
for
seven
or
eight
day
,
during
which
time
a
great
many
ship
from
Newcastle
come
into
the
same
road
,
as
the
common
harbour
where
the
ship
may
wait
for
a
wind
for
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
,
however
,
rid
here
so
long
,
but
should
have
tide
it
up
the
river
,
but
that
the
wind
blow
too
fresh
;
and
after
we
have
lain
four
or
five
day
,
blow
very
hard
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
road
be
reckon
as
good
as
a
harbour
,
the
anchorage
good
,
and
our
ground
tackle
very
strong
,
our
man
be
unconcerned
,
and
not
in
the
least
apprehensive
of
danger
,
but
spend
the
time
in
rest
and
mirth
,
after
the
manner
of
the
sea
;
but
the
eighth
day
in
the
morning
the
wind
increase
,
and
we
have
all
hand
at
work
to
strike
our
topmast
,
and
make
every
thing
snug
and
close
,
that
the
ship
may
ride
as
easy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
by
noon
the
sea
go
very
high
indeed
,
and
our
ship
rid
forecastle
in
,
ship
several
sea
,
and
we
think
once
or
twice
our
anchor
have
come
home
;
upon
which
our
master
order
out
the
sheet
anchor
;
so
that
we
ride
with
two
anchor
ahead
,
and
the
cable
veer
out
to
the
well
end
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
it
blow
a
terrible
storm
indeed
;
and
now
I
begin
to
see
terror
and
amazement
in
the
face
even
of
the
seaman
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
master
,
though
vigilant
in
the
business
of
preserve
the
ship
,
yet
as
he
go
in
and
out
of
his
cabin
by
me
,
I
could
hear
him
softly
to
himself
<EOS>
say
several
time
,
"
Lord
be
merciful
to
us
!
<EOS>
we
shall
be
all
lose
,
we
shall
be
all
undone
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
during
these
first
hurry
I
be
stupid
,
lie
still
in
my
cabin
,
which
be
in
the
steerage
,
and
can
not
describe
my
temper
:
I
could
ill
reassume
the
first
penitence
which
I
have
so
apparently
trample
upon
,
and
harden
myself
against
:
<EOS>
I
think
the
bitterness
of
death
have
be
past
,
and
that
this
would
be
nothing
like
the
first
:
but
when
the
master
himself
come
by
me
,
as
I
say
just
now
,
and
say
we
should
be
all
lose
,
I
be
dreadfully
fright
:
I
get
up
out
of
my
cabin
,
and
look
out
;
but
such
a
dismal
sight
I
never
see
;
the
sea
go
mountain
high
,
and
break
upon
us
every
three
or
four
minute
:
when
I
could
look
about
,
I
could
see
nothing
but
distress
round
us
:
two
ship
that
rid
near
us
,
we
find
,
have
cut
their
mast
by
the
board
,
be
deep
loaden
;
and
our
man
cry
out
,
that
a
ship
which
rid
about
a
mile
ahead
of
us
be
founder
.
<EOS>
two
more
ship
be
drive
from
their
anchor
,
be
run
out
of
the
road
to
sea
,
at
all
adventure
,
and
that
with
not
a
mast
standing
.
<EOS>
the
light
ship
fare
the
good
,
as
not
so
much
labour
in
the
sea
;
but
two
or
three
of
them
drive
,
and
come
close
by
us
,
run
away
with
only
their
sprit
-
sail
out
before
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
towards
evening
the
mate
and
boatswain
beg
the
master
of
our
ship
to
let
them
cut
away
the
fore
-
mast
,
which
he
be
very
unwilling
to
do
:
but
the
boatswain
protest
to
him
,
that
if
he
do
not
,
the
ship
would
founder
,
he
consent
;
and
when
they
have
cut
away
the
fore
-
mast
,
the
main
-
mast
stand
so
loose
,
and
shake
the
ship
so
much
,
they
be
oblige
to
cut
her
away
also
,
and
make
a
clear
deck
.
  
<EOS>
any
one
may
judge
what
a
condition
I
must
be
in
at
all
this
,
who
be
but
a
young
sailor
,
and
who
have
be
in
such
a
fright
before
at
but
a
little
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
can
express
at
this
distance
the
thought
I
have
about
me
at
that
time
,
I
be
in
tenfold
more
horror
of
mind
upon
account
of
my
former
conviction
,
and
the
have
return
from
them
to
the
resolution
I
have
wickedly
take
at
first
,
than
I
be
at
death
itself
;
and
these
,
add
to
the
terror
of
the
storm
,
put
me
in
such
a
condition
,
that
I
can
by
no
word
describe
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
bad
be
not
come
yet
;
the
storm
continue
with
such
fury
,
that
the
seaman
themselves
acknowledge
they
have
never
know
a
bad
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
good
ship
,
but
she
be
deep
loaden
,
and
wallow
in
the
sea
,
that
the
seaman
every
now
and
then
cry
out
,
she
would
founder
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
advantage
in
one
respect
,
that
I
do
not
know
what
they
mean
by
founder
till
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
storm
be
so
violent
,
that
I
see
what
be
not
often
see
,
the
master
,
the
boatswain
,
and
some
other
more
sensible
than
the
rest
,
at
their
prayer
,
and
expect
every
moment
when
the
ship
would
go
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
under
all
the
rest
of
our
distress
,
one
of
the
man
that
have
be
down
on
purpose
to
see
,
cry
out
,
we
have
spring
a
leak
;
another
say
,
there
be
four
foot
water
in
the
hold
.
<EOS>
then
all
hand
be
call
to
the
pump
.
<EOS>
at
that
very
word
my
heart
,
as
I
think
,
die
within
me
,
and
I
fall
backwards
upon
the
side
of
my
bed
where
I
sit
,
into
the
cabin
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
man
rouse
me
,
and
tell
me
,
that
I
that
be
able
to
do
nothing
before
,
be
as
well
able
to
pump
as
another
;
at
which
I
stir
up
,
and
go
to
the
pump
and
work
very
heartily
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
,
the
master
see
some
light
collier
,
who
,
not
able
to
ride
out
the
storm
,
be
oblige
to
slip
and
run
away
to
sea
,
and
would
come
near
us
,
order
to
fire
a
gun
as
a
signal
of
distress
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
know
nothing
what
that
mean
,
be
so
surprised
,
that
I
think
the
ship
have
break
,
or
some
dreadful
thing
happen
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
be
so
surprised
,
that
I
fall
down
in
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
as
this
be
a
time
when
every
body
have
his
own
life
to
think
of
,
nobody
mind
me
,
or
what
be
become
of
me
;
but
another
man
stept
up
to
the
pump
,
and
thrust
me
aside
with
his
foot
,
let
me
lie
,
think
I
have
be
dead
;
and
it
be
a
great
while
before
I
come
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
We
work
on
;
but
the
water
increase
in
the
hold
,
it
be
apparent
that
the
ship
would
founder
;
and
though
the
storm
begin
to
abate
a
little
;
yet
as
it
be
not
possible
she
could
swim
till
we
may
run
into
a
port
,
so
the
master
continue
fire
gun
for
help
;
and
a
light
ship
,
who
have
rid
it
out
just
ahead
of
us
,
venture
a
boat
out
to
help
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
the
utmost
hazard
the
boat
come
near
us
,
but
it
be
impossible
for
as
to
get
on
board
,
or
for
the
boat
to
lie
near
the
ship
's
side
,
till
at
last
the
man
row
very
heartily
,
and
venture
their
life
to
save
our
,
our
man
cast
them
a
rope
over
the
stern
with
a
buoy
to
it
,
and
then
veer
it
out
a
great
length
,
which
they
after
great
labour
and
hazard
take
hold
of
,
and
we
haul
them
close
under
our
stern
,
and
get
all
into
their
boat
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
no
purpose
for
them
or
us
,
after
we
be
in
the
boat
,
to
think
of
reach
to
their
own
ship
;
so
all
agree
to
let
her
drive
,
and
only
to
pull
her
in
towards
shore
as
much
as
we
could
;
and
our
master
promise
them
,
that
if
the
boat
be
stave
upon
shore
he
would
make
it
good
to
their
master
:
so
partly
row
and
partly
drive
,
our
boat
go
away
to
the
northward
,
slope
towards
the
shore
almost
as
far
as
Winterton
-
Ness
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
not
much
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
out
of
our
ship
<EOS>
but
we
see
her
sink
,
and
then
I
understand
for
the
first
time
what
be
mean
by
a
ship
founder
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
I
have
hardly
eye
to
look
up
when
the
seaman
tell
me
she
be
sink
;
for
from
that
moment
they
rather
put
me
into
the
boat
,
than
that
I
may
be
say
to
go
in
;
my
heart
be
,
as
it
be
,
dead
within
me
,
partly
with
fright
,
partly
with
horror
of
mind
,
and
the
thought
of
what
be
yet
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
in
this
condition
,
the
man
yet
labour
at
the
oar
to
bring
the
boat
near
the
shore
,
we
could
see
,
when
our
boat
mount
the
wave
we
be
able
to
see
the
shore
,
a
great
many
people
run
along
the
shore
to
assist
us
when
we
should
come
near
;
but
we
make
but
slow
way
towards
the
shore
,
nor
be
we
able
to
reach
the
shore
,
till
be
past
the
light
-
house
at
Winterton
,
the
shore
fall
off
to
the
westward
towards
Cromer
,
and
so
the
land
break
off
a
little
the
violence
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
here
we
get
in
,
and
,
though
not
without
much
difficulty
,
get
all
safe
on
shore
,
and
walk
afterwards
on
foot
to
Yarmouth
,
where
,
as
unfortunate
man
,
we
be
use
with
great
humanity
,
as
well
by
the
magistrate
of
the
town
,
who
assign
us
good
quarter
,
as
by
particular
merchant
and
owner
of
ship
,
and
have
money
give
us
sufficient
to
carry
us
either
to
London
or
back
to
Hull
,
as
we
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
now
have
the
sense
to
have
go
back
to
Hull
,
and
have
go
home
,
I
have
be
happy
,
and
my
father
,
an
emblem
of
our
bless
Saviour
's
parable
,
have
even
kill
the
fat
calf
for
me
;
<EOS>
for
hear
the
ship
I
go
away
in
be
cast
away
in
Yarmouth
Roads
,
it
be
a
great
while
before
he
have
any
assurance
that
I
be
not
drown
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
ill
fate
push
me
on
now
with
an
obstinacy
that
nothing
could
resist
;
and
though
I
have
several
time
loud
call
from
my
reason
and
my
more
composed
judgment
to
go
home
,
yet
I
have
no
power
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
call
this
,
nor
will
I
urge
that
it
be
a
secret
over
-
rule
decree
that
hurry
us
on
to
be
the
instrument
of
our
own
destruction
,
even
though
it
be
before
us
,
and
that
we
push
upon
it
with
our
eye
open
.
<EOS>
certainly
nothing
but
some
such
decreed
unavoidable
misery
attend
,
and
which
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
escape
,
could
have
push
me
forward
against
the
calm
reasoning
and
persuasion
of
my
most
retire
thought
,
and
against
two
such
visible
instruction
as
I
have
meet
with
in
my
first
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
My
comrade
,
who
have
help
to
harden
me
before
,
and
who
be
the
master
's
son
,
be
now
less
forward
than
I.
<EOS>
the
first
time
he
speak
to
me
after
we
be
at
Yarmouth
,
which
be
not
till
two
or
three
day
,
for
we
be
separate
in
the
town
to
several
quarter
;
I
say
,
the
first
time
he
see
me
,
it
appear
his
tone
be
alter
,
and
look
very
melancholy
,
and
shake
his
head
,
ask
me
how
I
do
,
and
tell
his
father
who
I
be
,
and
how
I
have
come
this
voyage
only
for
a
trial
,
in
order
to
go
farther
abroad
;
his
father
turn
to
me
with
a
very
grave
and
concerned
tone
,
"
young
man
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
ought
never
to
go
to
sea
any
more
;
you
ought
to
take
this
for
a
plain
and
visible
token
that
you
be
not
to
be
a
seafare
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
will
you
go
to
sea
no
more
?
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
another
case
,
"
say
he
;
"
it
be
my
calling
,
and
therefore
my
duty
;
but
as
you
make
this
voyage
for
a
trial
,
you
see
what
a
taste
Heaven
have
give
you
of
what
you
be
to
expect
if
you
persist
:
perhaps
this
be
all
befall
us
on
your
account
,
like
Jonah
in
the
ship
of
Tarshish
.
<EOS>
pray
,
"
continue
he
,
"
what
be
you
?
<EOS>
and
on
what
account
do
you
go
to
sea
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
that
I
tell
him
some
of
my
story
;
at
the
end
of
which
he
burst
out
with
a
strange
kind
of
passion
;
"
what
have
I
do
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
such
an
unhappy
wretch
should
come
into
my
ship
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
set
my
foot
in
the
same
ship
with
thee
again
for
a
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
this
indeed
be
,
as
I
say
,
an
excursion
of
his
spirit
,
which
be
yet
agitate
by
the
sense
of
his
loss
,
and
be
farth
than
he
could
have
authority
to
go
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
afterwards
talk
very
gravely
to
me
,
exhort
me
to
go
back
to
my
father
,
and
not
tempt
Providence
to
my
ruin
;
tell
me
I
may
see
a
visible
hand
of
Heaven
against
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
young
man
,
"
say
he
,
"
depend
upon
it
,
if
you
do
not
go
back
,
wherever
you
go
,
you
will
meet
with
nothing
but
disaster
and
disappointment
,
till
your
father
's
word
be
fulfil
upon
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
part
soon
after
;
for
I
make
him
little
answer
,
and
I
see
him
no
more
:
which
way
he
go
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
have
some
money
in
my
pocket
,
I
travel
to
London
by
land
;
and
there
,
as
well
as
on
the
road
,
have
many
struggle
with
myself
,
what
course
of
life
I
should
take
,
and
whether
I
should
go
home
,
or
go
to
sea
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
go
home
,
shame
oppose
the
good
motion
that
offer
to
my
thought
;
and
it
immediately
occur
to
me
how
I
should
be
laugh
at
among
the
neighbour
,
and
should
be
ashamed
to
see
,
not
my
father
and
mother
only
,
but
even
every
body
else
;
from
whence
I
have
since
often
observe
,
how
incongruous
and
irrational
the
common
temper
of
mankind
be
,
especially
of
youth
,
to
that
reason
which
ought
to
guide
them
in
such
case
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
not
ashamed
to
sin
,
and
yet
be
ashamed
to
repent
;
nor
ashamed
of
the
action
for
which
they
ought
justly
to
be
esteem
fool
,
but
be
ashamed
of
the
return
,
which
only
can
make
them
be
esteem
wise
man
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
life
however
I
remain
some
time
,
uncertain
what
measure
to
take
,
and
what
course
of
life
to
lead
.
<EOS>
an
irresistible
reluctance
continue
to
go
home
;
and
as
I
stay
a
while
,
the
remembrance
of
the
distress
I
have
be
in
wear
off
;
and
as
that
abate
,
the
little
motion
I
have
in
my
desire
to
a
return
wear
off
with
it
,
till
at
last
I
quite
lay
aside
the
thought
of
it
,
and
look
out
for
a
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
that
evil
influence
which
carry
me
first
away
from
my
father
's
house
,
that
hurry
me
into
the
wild
and
indigested
notion
of
raise
my
fortune
;
and
that
impress
those
conceit
so
forcibly
upon
me
,
as
to
make
me
deaf
to
all
good
advice
,
and
to
the
entreaty
and
even
the
command
of
my
father
:
<EOS>
I
say
,
the
same
influence
,
whatever
it
be
,
present
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
enterprise
to
my
view
;
and
I
go
on
board
a
vessel
bind
to
the
coast
of
Africa
;
or
,
as
our
sailor
vulgarly
call
it
,
a
voyage
to
Guinea
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
great
misfortune
that
in
all
these
adventure
I
do
not
ship
myself
as
a
sailor
;
whereby
,
though
I
may
indeed
have
work
a
little
harder
than
ordinary
,
yet
at
the
same
time
I
have
learn
the
duty
and
office
of
a
foremastman
;
and
in
time
may
have
qualify
myself
for
a
mate
or
lieutenant
,
if
not
for
a
master
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
always
my
fate
to
choose
for
the
bad
,
so
I
do
here
;
for
have
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
good
clothe
upon
my
back
<EOS>
,
I
would
always
go
on
board
in
the
habit
of
a
gentleman
;
and
so
I
neither
have
any
business
in
the
ship
,
or
learn
to
do
any
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
lot
first
of
all
to
fall
into
pretty
good
company
in
London
,
which
do
not
always
happen
to
such
loose
and
unguided
young
fellow
as
I
then
be
;
the
devil
generally
not
omit
to
lay
some
snare
for
them
very
early
:
but
it
be
not
so
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
first
fall
acquaint
with
the
master
of
a
ship
who
have
be
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
;
and
who
,
have
have
very
good
success
there
,
be
resolve
to
go
again
;
and
who
take
a
fancy
to
my
conversation
,
which
be
not
at
all
disagreeable
at
that
time
,
hear
me
<EOS>
say
I
have
a
mind
to
see
the
world
,
tell
me
if
I
would
go
the
voyage
with
him
<EOS>
I
should
be
at
no
expense
;
I
should
be
his
messmate
and
his
companion
;
and
if
I
could
carry
any
thing
with
me
,
I
should
have
all
the
advantage
of
it
that
the
trade
would
admit
;
and
perhaps
I
may
meet
with
some
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
I
embrace
the
offer
;
and
enter
into
a
strict
friendship
with
this
captain
,
who
be
an
honest
and
plain
-
deal
man
<EOS>
,
I
go
the
voyage
with
him
,
and
carry
a
small
adventure
with
me
,
which
,
by
the
disinterested
honesty
of
my
friend
the
captain
,
I
increase
very
considerably
;
for
I
carry
about
40l
.
<EOS>
in
such
toy
and
trifle
as
the
captain
direct
me
to
buy
.
<EOS>
this
40l
.
<EOS>
I
have
muster
together
by
the
assistance
of
some
of
my
relation
whom
I
correspond
with
,
and
who
,
I
believe
,
get
my
father
,
or
at
least
my
mother
,
to
contribute
so
much
as
that
to
my
first
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
voyage
which
I
may
say
be
successful
in
all
my
adventure
,
and
which
I
owe
to
the
integrity
and
honesty
of
my
friend
the
captain
,
under
whom
also
I
get
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
mathematic
and
the
rule
of
navigation
,
learn
how
to
keep
an
account
of
the
ship
's
course
,
take
an
observation
,
and
,
in
short
,
to
understand
some
thing
that
be
needful
to
be
understand
by
a
sailor
:
for
,
as
he
take
delight
to
instruct
me
,
I
take
delight
to
learn
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
this
voyage
make
me
both
a
sailor
and
a
merchant
:
<EOS>
for
I
bring
home
five
pound
nine
ounce
of
gold
-
dust
for
my
adventure
,
which
yield
me
in
London
at
my
return
almost
300l
.
<EOS>
and
this
fill
me
with
those
aspire
thought
which
have
so
complete
my
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
yet
even
in
this
voyage
I
have
my
misfortune
too
;
particularly
,
that
I
be
continually
sick
,
be
throw
into
a
violent
calenture
by
the
excessive
heat
of
the
climate
;
our
principal
trading
be
upon
the
coast
,
from
the
latitude
of
15
degree
north
even
to
the
line
itself
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
set
up
for
a
Guinea
trader
;
and
my
friend
,
to
my
great
misfortune
,
die
soon
after
his
arrival
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
go
the
same
voyage
again
,
and
I
embark
in
the
same
vessel
with
one
who
be
his
mate
in
the
former
voyage
,
and
have
now
get
the
command
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
unhappiest
voyage
that
ever
man
make
;
for
though
I
do
not
carry
quite
100l
.
<EOS>
of
my
new
-
gain
wealth
,
so
that
I
have
200l
.
<EOS>
leave
,
and
which
I
lodge
with
my
friend
's
widow
,
who
be
very
just
to
me
,
yet
I
fall
into
terrible
misfortune
in
this
voyage
;
and
the
first
be
this
,
viz
.
<EOS>
our
ship
make
her
course
towards
the
Canary
Islands
,
or
rather
between
those
island
and
the
african
shore
,
be
surprised
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
by
a
turkish
rover
of
Sallee
,
who
give
chase
to
us
with
all
the
sail
she
could
make
.
<EOS>
We
crowd
also
as
much
canvass
as
our
yard
would
spread
,
or
our
mast
carry
,
to
have
get
clear
;
but
find
the
pirate
gain
upon
us
,
and
would
certainly
come
up
with
us
in
a
few
hour
,
we
prepare
to
fight
;
our
ship
have
twelve
gun
,
and
the
rogue
eighteen
.
<EOS>
about
three
in
the
afternoon
he
come
up
with
us
,
and
bring
to
by
mistake
<EOS>
just
athwart
our
quarter
,
instead
of
athwart
our
stern
,
<EOS>
as
he
intend
,
we
bring
eight
of
our
gun
to
bear
on
that
side
,
and
pour
in
a
broadside
upon
him
,
which
make
him
sheer
off
again
,
after
return
our
fire
,
and
pour
in
also
his
small
-
shot
from
near
200
man
which
he
have
on
board
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
have
not
a
man
touch
,
all
our
man
keep
close
.
<EOS>
He
prepare
to
attack
us
again
,
and
we
to
defend
ourselves
;
but
lay
us
on
board
the
next
time
upon
our
other
quarter
,
he
enter
sixty
man
upon
our
deck
,
who
immediately
fall
to
cut
and
hack
the
deck
and
rig
.
<EOS>
We
ply
them
with
small
-
shot
,
half
-
pike
,
powder
-
cheat
,
and
such
like
,
and
clear
our
deck
of
them
twice
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
cut
short
this
melancholy
part
of
our
story
,
our
ship
be
disable
,
and
three
of
our
man
kill
and
eight
wound
,
we
be
oblige
to
yield
,
and
be
carry
all
prisoner
into
Sallee
,
a
port
belong
to
the
Moors
.
  
<EOS>
the
usage
I
have
there
be
not
so
dreadful
as
at
first
I
apprehend
;
nor
be
<EOS>
I
carry
up
the
country
to
the
emperor
's
court
,
as
the
rest
of
our
man
be
,
but
be
keep
by
the
captain
of
the
rover
as
his
proper
prize
,
and
make
his
slave
,
be
young
and
nimble
,
and
fit
for
his
business
.
<EOS>
at
this
surprising
change
of
my
circumstance
,
from
a
merchant
to
a
miserable
slave
,
I
be
perfectly
overwhelmed
;
and
now
I
look
back
upon
my
father
's
prophetic
discourse
to
me
,
that
I
should
be
miserable
,
and
have
none
to
relieve
me
,
which
I
think
be
now
so
effectually
bring
to
pass
,
that
I
could
not
be
bad
;
that
now
the
hand
of
Heaven
have
overtake
me
,
and
I
be
undo
without
redemption
:
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
this
be
but
a
taste
of
the
misery
I
be
to
go
through
,
as
will
appear
in
the
sequel
of
this
story
.
  
<EOS>
as
my
new
patron
,
or
master
,
have
take
me
home
to
his
house
,
so
I
be
in
hope
that
he
would
take
me
with
him
when
he
go
to
sea
again
,
believe
that
it
would
sometime
or
other
be
his
fate
to
be
take
by
a
spanish
or
portugal
man
of
war
,
and
that
then
I
should
be
set
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
but
this
hope
of
mine
be
soon
take
away
;
for
when
he
go
to
sea
,
he
leave
me
on
shore
to
look
after
his
little
garden
,
and
do
the
common
drudgery
of
slave
about
his
house
;
and
when
he
come
home
again
from
his
cruise
,
he
order
me
to
be
in
the
cabin
to
look
after
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
meditate
nothing
but
my
escape
,
and
what
method
I
may
take
to
effect
it
,
but
find
no
way
that
have
the
least
probability
in
it
:
<EOS>
nothing
present
to
make
the
supposition
of
it
rational
;
for
I
have
nobody
to
communicate
it
to
that
would
embark
with
me
,
no
fellow
slave
,
no
Englishman
,
Irishman
,
or
Scotsman
there
but
myself
;
so
that
for
two
year
,
though
I
often
please
myself
with
the
imagination
,
yet
I
never
have
the
least
encouraging
prospect
of
put
it
in
practice
.
  
<EOS>
after
about
two
year
an
odd
circumstance
present
itself
,
which
put
the
old
thought
of
make
some
attempt
for
my
liberty
again
in
my
head
:
my
patron
lie
at
home
longer
than
usual
without
fit
out
his
ship
,
which
,
as
I
hear
,
be
for
want
of
money
,
he
use
constantly
,
once
or
twice
a
week
,
sometimes
oftener
,
if
the
weather
be
fair
,
to
take
the
ship
's
pinnace
,
and
go
out
into
the
road
a
-
fishing
;
and
as
he
always
take
me
and
a
young
Maresco
with
him
to
row
the
boat
,
we
make
him
very
merry
,
and
I
prove
very
dexterous
in
catch
fish
;
insomuch
that
sometimes
he
would
send
me
with
a
Moor
,
one
of
his
kinsman
,
and
the
youth
the
Maresco
,
as
they
call
him
,
to
catch
a
dish
of
fish
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
one
time
,
that
go
a
-
fishing
in
a
stark
calm
morning
,
a
fog
rise
so
thick
,
that
though
we
be
not
half
a
league
from
the
shore
we
lose
sight
of
it
;
and
row
we
know
not
whither
or
which
way
,
we
labour
all
day
,
and
all
the
next
night
,
and
when
the
morning
come
we
find
we
have
pull
off
to
sea
instead
of
pull
in
for
the
shore
;
and
that
we
be
at
least
two
league
from
the
shore
:
however
,
we
get
well
in
again
,
though
with
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
some
danger
;
for
the
wind
begin
to
blow
pretty
fresh
in
the
morning
;
but
particularly
we
be
all
very
hungry
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
patron
,
warn
by
this
disaster
,
resolve
to
take
more
care
of
himself
for
the
future
;
and
have
lie
by
him
the
long
-
boat
of
our
english
ship
he
have
take
,
he
resolve
he
would
not
go
a
-
fishing
any
more
without
a
compass
and
some
provision
;
so
he
order
the
carpenter
of
his
ship
,
who
also
be
an
english
slave
,
to
build
a
little
state
-
room
,
or
cabin
,
in
the
middle
of
the
long
-
boat
,
like
that
of
a
barge
,
with
a
place
to
stand
behind
it
to
steer
and
hale
home
the
main
-
sheet
;
and
room
before
for
a
hand
or
two
to
stand
and
work
the
sail
:
she
sail
with
that
we
call
a
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
;
and
the
boom
gibe
over
the
top
of
the
cabin
,
which
lie
very
snug
and
low
,
and
have
in
it
room
for
him
to
lie
,
with
a
slave
or
two
,
and
a
table
to
eat
on
,
with
some
small
locker
to
put
in
some
bottle
of
such
liquor
as
he
think
fit
to
drink
;
particularly
his
bread
,
rice
,
and
coffee
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
frequently
out
with
this
boat
a
-
fishing
,
and
as
I
be
most
dexterous
to
catch
fish
for
him
,
he
never
go
without
me
.
<EOS>
It
happen
that
he
have
appoint
to
go
out
in
this
boat
,
either
for
pleasure
or
for
fish
,
with
two
or
three
moor
of
some
distinction
in
that
place
,
and
for
whom
he
have
provide
extraordinarily
,
and
have
therefore
send
on
board
the
boat
over
-
night
a
large
store
of
provision
than
ordinary
;
and
have
order
me
to
get
ready
three
fuzee
with
powder
and
shot
,
which
be
on
board
his
ship
;
for
that
they
design
some
sport
of
fowling
as
well
as
fishing
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
all
thing
ready
as
he
have
direct
,
and
wait
the
next
morning
with
the
boat
wash
clean
,
her
ancient
and
pendant
out
,
and
every
thing
to
accommodate
his
guest
;
when
by
and
by
my
patron
come
on
board
alone
,
and
tell
me
his
guest
have
put
off
go
,
upon
some
business
that
fall
out
,
and
order
me
with
the
man
and
boy
,
as
usual
,
to
go
out
with
the
boat
and
catch
them
some
fish
,
for
that
his
friend
be
to
sup
at
his
house
;
and
command
that
as
soon
as
I
get
some
fish
I
should
bring
it
home
to
his
house
;
all
which
I
prepare
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
moment
my
former
notion
of
deliverance
dart
into
my
thought
,
for
now
I
find
I
be
like
to
have
a
little
ship
at
my
command
;
and
my
master
be
go
,
I
prepare
to
furnish
myself
,
not
for
fishing
business
,
but
for
a
voyage
;
though
I
know
not
,
neither
do
I
so
much
as
consider
,
whither
I
should
steer
;
for
any
where
to
get
out
of
that
place
be
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
contrivance
be
to
make
a
pretence
to
speak
to
this
Moor
,
to
get
something
for
our
subsistence
on
board
;
for
I
tell
him
we
must
not
presume
to
eat
of
our
patron
's
bread
;
he
say
,
that
be
true
:
so
he
bring
a
large
basket
of
rusk
or
bisket
of
their
kind
,
and
three
jar
with
fresh
water
,
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
my
patron
's
case
of
bottle
stand
,
which
it
be
evident
,
by
the
make
,
be
take
out
of
some
English
prize
,
and
I
convey
them
into
the
boat
while
the
Moor
be
on
shore
,
as
if
they
have
be
there
before
for
our
master
:
<EOS>
I
convey
also
a
great
lump
of
bee
-
wax
into
the
boat
,
which
weigh
above
half
a
hundred
weight
,
with
a
parcel
of
twine
or
thread
,
a
hatchet
,
a
saw
,
and
a
hammer
,
all
which
be
of
great
use
to
us
afterwards
,
especially
the
wax
to
make
candle
.
<EOS>
another
trick
I
try
upon
him
,
which
he
innocently
come
into
also
;
his
name
be
Ismael
,
whom
they
call
Muly
or
Moley
;
<EOS>
so
I
call
to
him
:
"
<EOS>
Moley
,
"
say
I
,
"
our
patron
's
gun
be
on
board
the
boat
;
can
you
not
get
a
little
powder
and
shot
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
we
may
kill
some
alcamie
(
a
fowl
like
our
curlew
)
for
ourselves
,
for
I
know
he
keep
the
gunner
's
store
in
the
ship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
bring
some
;
<EOS>
"
and
accordingly
he
bring
a
great
leather
pouch
which
hold
about
a
pound
and
a
half
of
powder
,
or
rather
more
;
and
another
with
shot
,
that
have
five
or
six
pound
,
with
some
bullet
,
and
put
all
into
the
boat
;
at
the
same
time
I
have
find
some
powder
of
my
master
be
in
the
great
cabin
,
with
which
I
fill
one
of
the
large
bottle
in
the
case
,
which
be
almost
empty
,
pour
what
be
in
it
into
another
;
and
thus
furnish
with
every
thing
needful
,
we
sail
out
of
the
port
to
fish
.
<EOS>
the
castle
,
which
be
at
the
entrance
of
the
port
,
know
who
we
be
,
and
take
no
notice
of
us
:
and
we
be
not
above
a
mile
out
of
the
port
before
we
hale
in
our
sail
,
and
set
us
down
to
fish
.
<EOS>
the
wind
blow
from
the
N.N.E.
which
be
contrary
to
my
desire
;
for
have
it
blow
southerly
,
I
have
be
sure
to
have
make
the
coast
of
Spain
,
and
at
last
reach
to
the
bay
of
Cadiz
;
but
my
resolution
be
,
blow
which
way
<EOS>
it
would
,
I
would
be
go
from
that
horrid
place
where
I
be
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
fate
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
fish
some
time
and
catch
nothing
,
for
when
I
have
fish
on
my
hook
<EOS>
I
would
not
pull
them
up
,
that
he
may
not
see
them
<EOS>
,
I
say
to
the
Moor
,
"
this
will
not
do
;
our
master
will
not
be
thus
serve
;
we
must
stand
farther
off
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
think
no
harm
,
agree
,
and
be
in
the
head
of
the
boat
set
the
sail
;
and
as
I
have
the
helm
I
run
the
boat
out
near
a
league
farther
,
and
then
bring
her
to
as
if
I
would
fish
;
when
give
the
boy
the
helm
,
I
step
forward
to
where
the
Moor
be
,
and
make
as
if
I
stoop
for
something
behind
him
,
I
take
him
by
surprise
with
my
arm
under
his
twist
,
and
toss
him
clear
overboard
into
the
sea
;
he
rise
immediately
,
for
he
swam
like
a
cork
,
and
call
to
me
,
beg
to
be
take
in
,
tell
me
he
would
go
all
over
the
world
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
swam
so
strong
after
the
boat
,
that
he
would
have
reach
me
very
quickly
,
there
be
but
little
wind
;
upon
which
I
step
into
the
cabin
,
and
fetch
one
of
the
fowling
-
piece
,
I
present
it
at
him
,
and
tell
him
,
I
have
do
him
no
hurt
,
and
if
he
would
be
quiet
I
would
do
him
none
:
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
you
swim
well
enough
to
reach
to
the
shore
,
and
the
sea
be
calm
;
make
the
good
of
your
way
to
shore
,
and
I
will
do
you
no
harm
;
but
if
you
come
near
the
boat
I
will
shoot
you
through
the
head
,
for
I
be
resolve
to
have
my
liberty
:
"
<EOS>
so
he
turn
himself
about
,
and
swam
for
the
shore
,
and
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
reach
it
with
ease
,
for
he
be
an
excellent
swimmer
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
have
be
content
to
have
take
this
Moor
with
me
,
and
have
drown
the
boy
,
but
there
be
no
venture
to
trust
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
I
turn
to
the
boy
,
whom
they
call
Xury
,
and
say
to
him
,
"
xury
,
if
you
will
be
faithful
to
me
I
will
make
you
a
great
man
;
but
if
you
will
not
stroke
your
face
to
be
true
to
me
,
"
that
is
,
swear
by
Mahomet
and
his
father
's
beard
,
"
I
must
throw
you
into
the
sea
too
.
<EOS>
"
the
boy
smile
in
my
face
,
and
speak
so
innocently
,
that
I
could
not
mistrust
him
;
and
swear
to
be
faithful
to
me
,
and
go
all
over
the
world
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
in
view
of
the
Moor
that
be
swim
,
I
stand
out
directly
to
sea
with
the
boat
,
rather
stretch
to
windward
,
that
they
may
think
me
go
towards
the
Straits
'
mouth
;
(
as
indeed
any
one
that
have
be
in
their
wit
must
have
be
suppose
to
do
)
for
who
would
have
suppose
we
be
sail
on
to
the
southward
to
the
truly
barbarian
coast
,
where
whole
nation
of
Negroes
be
sure
to
surround
us
with
the
canoe
,
and
destroy
us
;
where
we
could
never
once
go
on
shore
but
we
should
be
devour
by
savage
beast
,
or
more
merciless
savage
of
human
kind
?
  
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
it
grow
dusk
in
the
evening
,
I
change
my
course
,
and
steer
directly
south
and
by
east
,
bend
my
course
a
little
toward
the
east
,
that
I
may
keep
in
with
the
shore
;
and
have
a
fair
,
fresh
gale
of
wind
,
and
a
smooth
,
quiet
sea
,
I
make
such
sail
that
I
believe
by
the
next
day
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
when
I
first
make
the
land
,
I
could
not
be
less
than
150
mile
south
of
Sallee
;
quite
beyond
the
Emperor
of
Morocco
's
dominion
,
or
indeed
of
any
other
king
thereabout
,
for
we
see
no
people
.
  
<EOS>
yet
such
be
the
fright
I
have
take
at
the
Moors
,
and
the
dreadful
apprehension
I
have
of
fall
into
their
hand
,
that
I
would
not
stop
,
or
go
on
shore
,
or
come
to
an
anchor
;
the
wind
continue
fair
<EOS>
till
I
have
sail
in
that
manner
five
day
,
and
then
the
wind
shift
to
the
southward
,
I
conclude
also
that
if
any
of
our
vessel
be
in
chase
of
me
,
they
also
would
now
give
over
;
so
I
venture
to
make
to
the
coast
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
,
I
know
not
what
,
or
where
;
neither
what
latitude
,
what
country
,
what
nation
,
or
what
river
:
<EOS>
I
neither
see
,
or
desire
to
see
any
people
;
the
principal
thing
I
want
be
fresh
water
.
<EOS>
We
come
into
this
creek
in
the
evening
,
resolve
to
swim
on
shore
as
soon
as
it
be
dark
,
and
discover
the
country
;
but
as
soon
as
it
be
quite
dark
,
we
hear
,
such
dreadful
noise
of
the
barking
,
roaring
,
and
howling
of
wild
creature
,
of
<EOS>
we
know
not
what
kind
that
the
poor
boy
be
ready
to
die
with
fear
,
and
beg
of
me
not
to
go
on
shore
till
day
.
<EOS>
"
well
,
Xury
,
"
say
I
,
"
then
I
will
not
;
but
it
may
be
we
may
see
man
by
day
,
who
will
be
as
bad
to
us
as
those
lion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
give
them
the
shoot
gun
,
"
say
xury
,
laughing
,
"
make
them
run
wey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
English
Xury
speak
by
converse
among
us
slave
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
glad
to
see
the
boy
so
cheerful
,
and
I
give
him
a
dram
(
out
of
our
patron
's
case
of
bottle
)
to
cheer
him
up
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
Xury
's
advice
be
good
,
and
I
take
it
;
we
drop
our
little
anchor
,
and
lie
still
all
night
;
I
say
still
,
for
we
sleep
none
;
for
in
two
or
three
hour
we
see
vast
great
creature
<EOS>
(
we
know
not
what
to
call
them
)
of
many
sort
,
come
down
to
the
sea
-
shore
and
run
into
the
water
,
wallowing
and
wash
themselves
for
the
pleasure
of
cool
themselves
;
and
they
make
such
hideous
howling
and
yelling
,
that
I
never
indeed
hear
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
xury
be
dreadfully
fright
,
and
indeed
so
be
I
too
;
but
we
be
both
more
frighted
when
we
hear
one
of
these
mighty
creature
come
swim
towards
our
boat
;
we
could
not
see
him
,
but
<EOS>
we
may
hear
him
by
his
blowing
to
be
a
monstrous
huge
and
furious
beast
;
Xury
say
it
be
a
lion
,
and
it
may
be
so
for
aught
I
know
;
but
poor
xury
cry
to
me
to
weigh
the
anchor
and
row
away
:
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
xury
;
we
can
slip
our
cable
with
the
buoy
to
it
,
and
go
off
to
sea
;
they
can
not
follow
us
far
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
sooner
say
so
,
but
I
perceive
the
creature
(
whatever
it
be
)
within
two
oar
'
length
,
which
something
surprise
me
;
however
,
I
immediately
step
to
the
cabin
-
door
,
and
take
up
my
gun
fire
at
him
;
upon
which
he
immediately
turn
about
,
and
swam
towards
the
shore
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
describe
the
horrible
noise
,
and
hideous
cry
and
howling
,
that
be
raise
,
as
well
upon
the
edge
of
the
shore
as
high
within
the
country
,
upon
the
noise
or
report
of
the
gun
,
a
thing
I
have
some
reason
to
believe
those
creature
have
never
hear
before
:
this
convince
me
that
there
be
no
go
on
shore
for
us
in
the
night
upon
that
coast
,
and
how
to
venture
on
shore
in
the
day
be
another
question
too
;
for
to
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
any
of
the
savage
,
have
be
as
bad
as
to
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
lion
and
tiger
;
at
least
we
be
equally
apprehensive
of
the
danger
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
would
,
we
be
oblige
to
go
on
shore
somewhere
or
other
for
water
,
for
we
have
not
a
pint
leave
in
the
boat
<EOS>
;
when
or
where
to
get
it
,
be
the
point
:
xury
say
,
if
I
would
let
him
go
on
shore
with
one
of
the
jar
,
he
would
find
if
there
be
any
water
,
and
bring
some
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
why
he
would
go
?
<EOS>
why
I
should
not
go
,
and
he
stay
in
the
boat
?
<EOS>
the
boy
answer
with
so
much
affection
,
that
make
me
love
him
ever
after
.
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
if
wild
man
come
,
they
eat
me
,
you
go
wey
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Xury
,
"
say
I
,
"
we
will
both
go
,
and
if
the
wild
man
come
,
we
will
kill
them
,
they
shall
eat
neither
of
us
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
give
Xury
a
piece
of
rusk
bread
to
eat
,
and
a
dram
out
of
our
patron
's
case
of
bottle
which
I
mention
before
;
and
we
hale
the
boat
in
as
near
the
shore
as
we
think
be
proper
,
and
wade
on
shore
;
carry
nothing
but
our
arm
,
and
two
jar
for
water
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
boat
,
fear
the
coming
of
canoe
with
savage
down
the
river
;
but
the
boy
see
a
low
place
about
a
mile
up
the
country
,
ramble
to
it
;
and
by
and
by
I
see
him
come
run
towards
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
pursue
by
some
savage
,
or
fright
with
some
wild
beast
,
and
I
run
forward
towards
him
to
help
him
;
but
when
I
come
nearer
to
him
,
I
see
something
hang
over
his
shoulder
,
which
be
a
creature
that
he
have
shoot
,
like
a
hare
,
but
different
in
colour
,
and
long
leg
;
however
,
we
be
very
glad
of
it
,
and
it
be
very
good
meat
;
but
the
great
joy
that
poor
Xury
come
with
,
be
to
tell
me
that
he
have
find
good
water
,
and
see
no
wild
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
find
afterwards
that
we
need
not
take
such
pain
for
water
,
for
a
little
high
up
the
creek
where
we
be
<EOS>
,
we
find
the
water
fresh
when
the
tide
be
out
,
which
flow
but
a
little
way
up
;
so
we
fill
our
jar
,
and
feast
on
the
hare
we
have
kill
,
and
prepare
to
go
on
our
way
,
have
see
no
footstep
of
any
human
creature
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
be
one
voyage
to
this
coast
before
,
I
know
very
well
that
the
island
of
the
Canaries
,
and
the
Cape
de
Verd
island
also
,
lie
not
far
off
from
the
coast
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
have
no
instrument
to
take
an
observation
to
know
what
latitude
we
be
in
,
and
not
exactly
know
,
or
at
least
remember
what
latitude
they
be
in
,
and
know
not
where
to
look
for
them
,
or
when
to
stand
off
to
sea
towards
them
;
otherwise
I
may
now
easily
have
find
some
of
these
island
.
<EOS>
but
my
hope
be
,
that
if
I
stand
along
this
coast
till
I
come
to
that
part
where
the
English
trade
,
I
should
find
some
of
their
vessel
upon
their
usual
design
of
trade
,
that
would
relieve
and
take
us
in
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
good
of
my
calculation
,
that
place
where
I
now
be
,
must
be
that
country
,
which
,
lie
between
the
emperor
of
Morocco
's
dominion
and
the
Negroes
,
lie
waste
,
and
uninhabite
,
except
by
wild
beast
;
the
Negroes
have
abandon
it
,
and
go
farther
south
for
fear
of
the
Moors
;
and
the
moor
not
think
it
worth
inhabit
,
by
reason
of
its
barrenness
;
and
indeed
both
forsake
it
because
of
the
prodigious
number
of
tiger
,
lion
,
leopard
,
and
other
furious
creature
which
harbour
there
;
so
that
the
moor
use
it
for
their
hunting
only
,
where
they
go
like
an
army
,
two
or
three
thousand
man
at
a
time
;
and
indeed
for
near
an
hundred
mile
together
upon
this
coast
,
we
see
nothing
but
a
waste
uninhabite
country
by
day
,
and
hear
nothing
but
howlings
and
roaring
of
wild
beast
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
once
or
twice
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
the
Pico
of
Teneriffe
,
be
the
high
top
of
the
Mountain
Teneriffe
in
the
canary
;
and
have
a
great
mind
to
venture
out
in
hope
of
reach
thither
;
but
have
try
twice
,
I
be
force
in
again
by
contrary
wind
,
the
sea
also
go
too
high
for
my
little
vessel
;
so
I
resolve
to
pursue
my
first
design
,
and
keep
along
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
several
time
I
be
oblige
to
land
for
fresh
water
,
after
we
have
leave
this
place
;
and
once
in
particular
,
be
early
in
the
morning
,
we
come
to
an
anchor
under
a
little
point
of
land
which
be
pretty
high
;
and
the
tide
begin
to
flow
,
we
lay
still
to
go
farther
in
.
<EOS>
xury
,
whose
eye
be
more
about
him
than
it
seem
mine
be
,
call
softly
to
me
,
and
tell
me
that
we
have
best
go
farther
off
the
shore
;
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
look
yonder
lie
a
dreadful
monster
on
the
side
of
that
hillock
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
I
look
where
he
point
,
and
see
a
dreadful
monster
indeed
,
for
it
be
a
terrible
great
lion
that
lie
on
the
side
of
the
shore
,
under
the
shade
of
a
piece
of
the
hill
that
hang
as
it
be
a
little
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
xury
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
shall
go
on
shore
and
kill
him
.
"
<EOS>
xury
look
fright
,
and
say
,
"
Me
kill
!
<EOS>
he
eat
me
at
one
mouth
;
"
one
mouthful
he
mean
:
however
,
I
say
no
more
to
the
boy
,
but
have
him
lie
still
,
and
I
take
our
big
gun
,
which
be
almost
musket
-
bore
,
and
load
it
with
a
good
charge
of
powder
,
and
with
two
slug
,
and
lay
it
down
;
then
I
load
another
gun
with
two
bullet
;
and
the
third
,
for
we
have
three
piece
,
I
load
with
five
small
bullet
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
good
aim
I
could
with
the
first
piece
,
to
have
shoot
him
into
the
head
,
but
he
lie
so
with
his
leg
raise
a
little
above
his
nose
,
that
the
slug
hit
his
leg
about
the
knee
,
and
break
the
bone
.
<EOS>
He
start
up
growl
at
first
,
but
find
his
leg
break
fall
down
again
,
and
then
get
up
upon
three
leg
,
and
give
the
most
hideous
roar
that
ever
I
hear
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
surprised
that
I
have
not
hit
him
on
the
head
;
however
,
I
look
up
the
second
piece
immediately
,
and
,
though
he
begin
to
move
off
,
fire
again
,
and
shoot
him
into
the
head
,
and
have
the
pleasure
to
see
him
drop
,
and
make
but
little
noise
,
but
he
struggle
for
life
.
<EOS>
then
Xury
take
heart
,
and
would
have
me
let
him
go
on
shore
:
"
well
,
go
,
"
say
I
;
<EOS>
so
the
boy
jump
into
the
water
,
and
take
a
little
gun
in
one
hand
,
swam
to
shore
with
the
other
hand
,
and
come
close
to
the
creature
,
put
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
to
his
ear
,
and
shoot
him
into
the
head
again
,
which
dispatch
him
quite
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
game
indeed
to
us
,
but
this
be
no
food
;
and
I
be
very
sorry
to
lose
three
charge
of
powder
and
shoot
upon
a
creature
that
be
good
for
nothing
to
us
.
<EOS>
however
,
Xury
say
he
would
have
some
of
him
;
so
he
come
on
board
,
and
ask
me
to
give
him
the
hatchet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
what
,
xury
?
"
say
I
,
"
Me
cut
off
his
head
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
however
,
Xury
could
not
cut
off
his
head
,
but
he
cut
off
a
foot
,
and
bring
it
with
him
,
and
it
be
a
monstrous
great
one
.
  
<EOS>
I
bethink
myself
however
,
that
perhaps
the
skin
of
him
may
one
way
or
other
be
of
some
value
to
us
;
and
I
resolve
to
take
off
his
skin
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
so
xury
and
I
go
to
work
with
him
;
but
Xury
be
much
the
well
workman
at
it
,
for
I
know
very
ill
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
take
us
up
both
the
whole
day
,
but
at
last
we
get
off
the
hide
of
him
,
and
spread
it
on
the
top
of
our
cabin
,
the
sun
effectually
dry
it
in
two
day
time
,
and
it
afterwards
serve
me
to
lie
upon
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
stop
,
we
make
on
to
the
southward
continually
for
ten
or
twelve
day
,
live
very
spare
on
our
provision
,
which
begin
to
abate
very
much
,
and
go
no
oftener
into
the
shore
than
we
be
oblige
to
for
fresh
water
:
my
design
in
this
be
,
to
make
the
river
Gambia
or
Senegal
,
that
be
to
say
,
any
where
about
the
Cape
de
Verd
,
where
I
be
in
hope
to
meet
with
some
european
ship
;
and
if
I
do
not
,
I
know
not
what
course
I
have
to
take
,
but
to
seek
for
the
island
,
or
perish
there
among
the
Negroes
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
all
the
ship
from
Europe
,
which
sail
either
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
or
Brasil
,
or
to
the
East
Indies
,
make
this
Cape
,
or
those
island
;
and
in
a
word
,
I
put
the
whole
of
my
fortune
upon
this
single
point
,
either
that
I
must
meet
with
some
ship
,
or
must
perish
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
pass
this
resolution
about
ten
day
longer
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
begin
to
see
that
the
land
be
inhabit
;
and
in
two
or
three
place
,
as
we
sail
by
,
we
see
people
stand
upon
the
shore
to
look
at
us
;
we
could
also
perceive
that
they
be
quite
black
,
and
stark
naked
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
incline
to
have
go
on
shore
to
them
;
but
Xury
be
my
well
counsellor
,
and
say
to
me
,
"
no
go
,
no
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
I
haul
in
nearer
the
shore
that
I
may
talk
to
them
,
and
I
find
they
run
along
the
shore
by
me
a
good
way
<EOS>
:
I
observe
they
have
no
weapon
in
their
hand
,
except
one
,
who
have
a
long
slend
stick
,
which
Xury
say
be
a
lance
,
and
that
they
would
throw
,
them
a
great
way
with
good
aim
;
so
I
keep
at
a
distance
,
but
talk
with
them
by
sign
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
particularly
make
sign
for
something
to
eat
;
they
beckon
to
me
to
stop
my
boat
,
and
they
would
fetch
me
some
meat
.
<EOS>
upon
this
I
lower
the
top
of
my
sail
,
and
lie
by
,
and
two
of
them
run
up
into
the
country
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
come
back
,
and
bring
with
them
two
piece
of
dry
flesh
and
some
corn
,
such
as
<EOS>
be
the
produce
of
their
country
;
but
we
neither
know
what
the
one
nor
the
other
be
:
however
,
we
be
willing
to
accept
it
,
but
how
to
come
at
it
be
our
next
dispute
,
for
I
be
not
for
venture
on
shore
to
them
,
and
they
be
as
much
afraid
of
us
:
but
they
take
a
safe
way
for
us
all
,
for
they
bring
it
to
the
shore
and
lay
it
down
,
and
go
and
stand
a
great
way
off
till
we
fetch
it
on
board
,
and
then
come
close
to
us
again
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
sign
of
thank
to
them
,
for
we
have
nothing
to
make
them
amend
;
but
an
opportunity
offer
that
very
instant
to
oblige
them
wonderfully
;
for
while
we
be
lie
by
the
shore
come
two
mighty
creature
,
one
pursue
the
other
(
as
we
take
it
)
with
great
fury
from
the
mountain
towards
the
sea
;
whether
it
be
the
male
pursue
the
female
,
or
whether
they
be
in
sport
or
in
rage
,
we
could
not
tell
,
any
more
than
we
could
tell
whether
it
be
usual
or
strange
,
but
I
believe
it
be
the
latter
;
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
those
ravenous
creature
seldom
appear
but
in
the
night
;
and
in
the
second
place
,
we
find
the
people
terribly
fright
,
especially
the
woman
.
<EOS>
the
man
that
have
the
lance
or
dart
do
not
fly
from
them
,
but
the
rest
do
;
however
,
as
the
two
creature
run
directly
into
the
water
,
they
do
not
seem
to
offer
to
fall
upon
any
of
the
Negroes
,
but
plunge
themselves
into
the
sea
,
and
swam
about
as
if
they
have
come
for
their
diversion
.
<EOS>
at
last
one
of
them
begin
to
come
nearer
our
boat
than
at
first
I
expect
;
but
I
lie
ready
for
him
,
for
I
have
load
my
gun
with
all
possible
expedition
,
and
have
xury
load
both
the
other
:
as
soon
as
he
come
fairly
within
my
reach
I
fire
,
and
shoot
him
directly
into
the
head
;
immediately
he
sink
down
into
the
water
,
but
rise
instantly
,
and
plunge
up
and
down
as
if
he
be
struggle
for
life
;
and
so
indeed
he
be
:
he
immediately
make
to
the
shore
;
but
between
the
wound
,
which
be
his
mortal
hurt
,
and
the
strangling
of
the
water
,
he
die
just
before
he
reach
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
of
these
poor
creature
at
the
noise
and
the
fire
of
my
gun
;
some
of
them
be
even
ready
to
die
for
fear
,
and
fall
down
as
dead
with
the
very
terror
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
see
the
creature
dead
,
and
sink
in
the
water
,
and
that
I
make
sign
to
them
to
come
to
the
shore
,
they
take
heart
and
come
to
the
shore
,
and
begin
to
search
for
the
creature
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
by
his
blood
stain
the
water
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
rope
,
which
I
sling
round
him
,
and
give
the
Negroes
to
hale
,
they
drag
him
on
shore
,
and
find
that
it
be
a
most
curious
leopard
,
spot
and
fine
to
an
admirable
degree
,
and
the
Negroes
hold
up
their
hand
with
admiration
to
think
what
it
be
I
have
kill
him
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
creature
,
fright
with
the
flash
of
fire
and
the
noise
of
the
gun
,
swam
on
shore
,
and
run
up
directly
to
the
mountain
from
whence
they
come
,
nor
could
I
at
that
distance
know
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
find
quickly
the
Negroes
be
for
eat
the
flesh
of
this
creature
,
so
I
be
willing
to
have
them
take
it
as
a
favour
from
me
,
which
,
when
I
make
sign
to
them
that
they
may
take
him
,
they
be
very
thankful
for
.
<EOS>
immediately
they
fall
to
work
with
him
,
and
though
they
have
no
knife
,
yet
with
a
sharpen
piece
of
wood
they
take
off
his
skin
as
readily
,
and
much
more
readily
,
than
we
could
have
do
with
a
knife
.
<EOS>
They
offer
me
some
of
the
flesh
,
which
I
decline
,
make
as
if
I
would
give
it
them
,
but
make
sign
for
the
skin
,
which
they
give
me
very
freely
,
and
bring
me
a
great
deal
more
of
their
provision
,
which
,
though
I
do
not
understand
,
yet
I
accept
;
then
I
make
sign
to
them
for
some
water
,
and
hold
out
one
of
my
jar
to
them
,
turn
it
bottom
upward
,
to
shew
that
it
be
empty
,
and
that
I
want
to
have
it
fill
.
<EOS>
They
call
immediately
to
some
of
their
friend
,
and
there
come
two
woman
,
and
bring
a
great
vessel
make
of
earth
,
and
burn
,
as
I
suppose
,
in
the
sun
;
this
they
set
down
for
me
,
as
before
,
and
I
send
xury
on
shore
with
my
jar
,
and
fill
them
all
three
.
<EOS>
the
woman
be
as
stark
naked
as
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
furnish
with
root
and
corn
,
such
as
it
be
,
and
water
;
and
,
leave
my
friendly
Negroes
,
I
make
forward
for
about
eleven
day
more
,
without
offer
to
go
near
the
shore
,
till
I
see
the
land
run
out
a
great
length
into
the
sea
,
at
about
the
distance
of
four
or
five
league
before
me
;
and
,
the
sea
be
very
calm
,
I
keep
a
large
offing
to
make
this
point
:
at
length
,
double
the
point
at
about
two
league
from
the
land
,
I
see
plainly
land
on
the
other
side
to
seaward
;
then
I
conclude
,
as
it
be
most
certain
indeed
,
that
this
be
the
Cape
de
Verd
,
and
those
the
island
,
call
from
thence
Cape
de
Verd
Islands
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
be
at
a
great
distance
,
and
I
could
not
well
tell
what
I
have
best
to
do
,
for
if
I
should
be
take
with
a
fresh
of
wind
<EOS>
I
may
neither
reach
one
nor
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
as
I
be
very
pensive
,
I
step
into
the
cabin
and
sit
me
down
,
xury
have
the
helm
,
when
on
a
sudden
the
boy
cry
out
,
"
Master
,
Master
,
a
ship
with
a
sail
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
foolish
boy
be
fright
out
of
his
wit
,
think
it
must
needs
be
some
of
his
master
's
ship
send
to
pursue
us
,
when
I
know
we
be
get
far
enough
out
of
their
reach
.
<EOS>
I
jump
out
of
the
cabin
,
and
immediately
see
not
only
the
ship
,
but
what
she
be
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
it
be
a
portuguese
ship
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
be
bind
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
for
Negroes
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
observe
the
course
she
steer
,
I
be
soon
convinced
they
be
bind
some
other
way
,
and
do
not
design
to
come
any
nearer
to
the
shore
;
upon
which
I
stretch
out
to
sea
as
much
as
I
could
,
resolve
to
speak
with
them
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
the
sail
I
could
muster
,
I
find
I
should
not
be
able
to
come
in
their
way
,
but
that
they
would
be
go
by
before
I
could
make
any
signal
to
them
;
but
after
I
have
crowd
to
the
utmost
,
and
begin
to
despair
,
they
,
it
seem
,
see
me
by
the
help
of
their
perspective
-
glass
,
and
that
it
be
some
european
boat
,
which
,
as
they
suppose
,
must
belong
to
some
ship
that
be
lose
;
so
they
shorten
sail
to
let
me
come
up
.
<EOS>
I
be
encourage
with
this
;
and
as
I
have
my
patron
's
ancient
on
board
,
I
make
a
waft
of
it
to
them
for
a
signal
of
distress
,
and
fire
a
gun
,
<EOS>
both
which
they
see
,
for
they
tell
me
they
see
the
smoke
,
though
they
do
not
hear
the
gun
:
upon
these
signal
they
very
kindly
bring
to
,
and
lie
by
for
me
,
and
in
about
three
hour
time
I
come
up
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
ask
me
what
I
be
in
Portuguese
,
and
in
Spanish
,
and
in
French
;
but
I
understand
none
of
them
;
but
at
last
a
Scots
sailor
,
who
be
on
board
,
call
to
me
,
and
I
answer
him
,
and
tell
him
I
be
an
Englishman
,
that
I
have
make
my
escape
out
of
slavery
from
the
Moors
at
Sallee
.
<EOS>
then
they
have
me
come
on
board
,
and
very
kindly
take
me
in
,
and
all
my
good
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
inexpressible
joy
to
me
,
that
any
one
would
believe
that
I
be
thus
deliver
,
as
I
esteem
it
,
from
such
a
miserable
and
almost
hopeless
condition
as
I
be
in
,
and
immediately
offer
all
I
have
to
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
as
a
return
for
my
deliverance
;
but
he
generously
tell
me
,
he
would
take
nothing
from
me
,
but
that
all
I
have
should
be
deliver
safe
to
me
when
I
come
to
the
brasil
;
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
save
your
life
on
no
other
term
than
I
would
be
glad
to
be
save
myself
;
and
it
may
one
time
or
other
be
my
lot
to
be
take
up
in
the
same
condition
:
besides
,
"
say
he
,
"
when
I
carry
you
to
the
Brasils
,
so
great
a
way
from
your
own
country
,
if
I
should
take
from
you
what
you
have
,
you
will
be
starve
there
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
only
take
away
that
life
I
have
give
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
Seignor
Inglese
,
"
say
he
,
"
Mr.
Englishman
,
I
will
carry
you
thither
in
charity
,
and
those
thing
will
help
you
to
buy
your
subsistence
there
,
and
your
passage
home
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
charitable
in
his
proposal
,
so
he
be
just
in
the
performance
to
a
tittle
;
for
he
order
the
seaman
,
that
none
should
offer
to
touch
any
thing
I
have
:
then
he
take
every
thing
into
his
own
possession
,
and
give
me
back
an
exact
inventory
of
them
,
that
I
may
have
them
;
even
so
much
as
my
three
earthen
jar
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
my
boat
,
it
be
a
very
good
one
,
and
that
he
see
,
and
tell
me
he
would
buy
it
of
me
for
the
ship
's
use
,
and
ask
me
what
I
would
have
for
it
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
he
have
be
so
generous
to
me
in
everything
,
that
I
could
not
offer
to
make
any
price
of
the
boat
,
but
leave
it
entirely
to
him
;
upon
which
he
tell
me
he
would
give
me
a
note
of
his
hand
to
pay
me
eighty
piece
of
eight
for
it
at
Brasil
;
and
when
it
come
there
,
if
any
one
offer
to
give
more
,
he
would
make
it
up
:
he
offer
me
also
sixty
piece
of
eight
more
for
my
boy
Xury
,
which
I
be
loath
to
lake
;
not
that
I
be
not
willing
to
let
the
captain
have
him
,
but
I
be
very
loath
to
sell
the
poor
boy
's
liberty
,
who
have
assist
me
so
faithfully
in
procure
my
own
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
let
him
know
my
reason
,
he
own
it
to
be
just
,
and
offer
me
this
medium
,
that
he
would
give
the
boy
an
obligation
to
set
him
free
in
ten
year
,
if
he
turn
Christian
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
and
xury
say
he
be
willing
to
go
to
him
,
I
let
the
captain
have
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
very
good
voyage
to
the
Brasils
,
and
arrive
in
the
Bay
de
Todos
los
Santos
,
or
all
Saints
'
Bay
,
in
about
twenty
-
two
day
after
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
once
more
deliver
from
the
most
miserable
of
all
condition
of
life
;
and
what
to
do
next
with
myself
<EOS>
I
be
now
to
consider
.
  
<EOS>
the
generous
treatment
the
captain
give
me
,
<EOS>
I
can
never
enough
remember
;
he
would
take
nothing
of
me
for
my
passage
,
give
me
twenty
ducat
for
the
leopard
's
skin
,
and
forty
for
the
lion
's
skin
which
I
have
in
my
boat
,
and
cause
every
thing
I
have
in
the
ship
to
be
punctually
deliver
me
;
and
what
I
be
willing
to
sell
<EOS>
he
buy
,
such
as
the
case
of
bottle
,
two
of
my
gun
,
and
a
piece
of
the
lump
of
bee
-
wax
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
make
candle
of
the
rest
;
in
a
word
,
I
make
about
two
hundred
and
twenty
piece
of
eight
of
all
my
cargo
;
and
with
this
stock
I
go
on
shore
in
the
Brasils
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
long
here
,
but
be
recommend
to
the
house
of
a
good
honest
man
like
himself
,
who
have
an
ingeino
as
they
call
it
;
that
is
,
a
plantation
and
a
sugarhouse
;
I
live
with
him
some
time
,
and
acquaint
myself
by
that
mean
with
the
manner
of
their
planting
and
making
of
sugar
;
and
see
how
well
the
planter
live
,
and
how
they
grow
rich
suddenly
,
I
resolve
,
if
I
could
get
license
to
settle
there
,
I
would
turn
planter
among
them
,
resolve
,
in
the
mean
time
,
to
find
out
some
way
to
get
my
money
,
which
I
have
leave
in
London
,
remit
to
me
.
<EOS>
to
this
purpose
,
get
a
kind
of
a
letter
of
naturalization
,
I
purchase
as
much
land
that
be
uncure
as
my
money
would
reach
,
and
form
a
plan
for
my
plantation
and
settlement
,
and
such
a
one
as
may
be
suitable
to
the
stock
which
I
propose
to
myself
to
receive
from
England
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
neighbour
,
a
Portuguese
of
Lisbon
,
but
bear
of
english
parent
,
whose
name
be
Wells
,
and
in
much
such
circumstance
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
call
him
neighbour
,
because
his
plantation
lie
next
to
mine
,
and
we
go
on
very
sociable
together
.
<EOS>
My
stock
be
but
low
,
as
well
as
his
:
and
we
rather
plant
for
food
,
than
any
thing
else
,
for
about
two
year
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
begin
to
increase
,
and
our
land
begin
to
come
into
order
;
so
that
the
third
year
we
plant
some
tobacco
,
and
make
each
of
us
a
large
piece
of
ground
ready
for
plant
cane
in
the
year
to
come
;
but
we
both
want
help
;
and
now
I
find
,
more
than
before
,
I
have
do
wrong
in
part
with
my
boy
xury
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
for
me
to
do
wrong
,
that
never
do
right
,
be
no
great
wonder
:
I
have
no
remedy
but
to
go
on
;
I
be
get
into
an
employment
quite
remote
to
my
genius
,
and
directly
contrary
to
the
life
I
delight
in
,
and
for
which
I
forsook
my
father
's
house
,
and
break
through
all
his
good
advice
;
nay
,
I
be
come
into
the
very
middle
station
,
or
upper
degree
of
low
life
,
which
my
father
advise
me
to
before
;
and
which
if
I
resolve
to
go
on
with
,
I
may
as
well
have
staid
at
home
,
and
never
have
fatigue
myself
in
the
world
as
I
have
do
;
and
I
use
often
to
say
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
could
have
do
this
as
well
in
England
among
my
friend
,
as
have
go
five
thousand
mile
off
to
do
it
,
among
stranger
and
savage
in
a
wilderness
,
and
at
such
distance
,
as
never
to
hear
from
any
part
of
the
world
that
have
the
least
knowledge
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
I
use
to
look
upon
my
condition
with
the
utmost
regret
.
<EOS>
I
have
nobody
to
converse
with
,
but
now
and
then
this
neighbour
;
no
work
to
be
do
,
but
by
the
labour
of
my
hand
;
and
I
use
to
say
,
I
live
just
like
a
man
cast
away
upon
some
desolate
island
,
that
have
nobody
there
but
himself
.
<EOS>
but
how
just
have
it
be
,
and
how
should
all
man
reflect
,
that
,
when
they
compare
their
present
condition
with
other
that
be
bad
,
Heaven
may
oblige
them
to
make
the
exchange
,
and
be
convince
of
their
former
felicity
,
by
their
experience
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
how
just
have
it
be
,
that
the
truly
solitary
life
I
reflect
on
in
,
an
island
of
mere
desolation
should
be
my
lot
,
who
have
so
often
unjustly
compare
it
with
the
life
which
I
then
lead
,
in
which
have
I
continue
,
I
have
in
all
probability
be
exceed
prosperous
and
rich
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
some
degree
settle
in
my
measure
for
carry
on
the
plantation
,
before
my
kind
friend
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
<EOS>
that
take
me
up
at
sea
,
go
back
;
for
the
ship
remain
there
,
in
provide
his
loading
,
and
prepare
for
his
voyage
,
near
three
month
;
when
,
tell
him
what
little
stock
I
have
leave
behind
me
in
London
,
he
give
me
this
friendly
and
sincere
advice
;
"
seignor
Inglese
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
for
so
he
always
call
me
,
"
if
you
will
give
me
letter
,
and
a
procuration
here
in
form
to
me
,
with
order
to
the
person

have
your

send
your
effect
to
Lisbon

I
shall
direct

be

I
will
bring
you

willing

at

since
human
affair
be
all
subject
to
change
and
disaster

I
would
have
you
give
order
but
for
one
hundred
pound
sterling
,
which
you
say
be
half
your
stock
,
and
let
the
hazard
be
run
for
the
first

so

if
it
come
safe

you
may
order
the
rest
the

way

if
it
miscarry
,
you
may
have
the
other
half
to
have
recourse
to
for
your
supply

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
wholesome
advice
,
and
look
so
friendly
,
that
I
could
not
but
be
convince
it
be
the
good
course
I
could
take
;
so
I
accordingly
prepare
letter
to
the
gentlewoman
with
whom
I
have
leave
my
money
,
and
a
procuration
to
the
portuguese
captain
,
as
he
desire
.
  
<EOS>
I
write
the
english
captain
's
widow
a
full
account
of
all
my
adventure
,
my
slavery
,
escape
,
and
<EOS>
how
I
have
meet
with
the
Portugal
captain
at
sea
,
the
humanity
of
his
behaviour
,
and
what
condition
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
,
with
all
other
necessary
direction
for
my
supply
;
and
when
this
honest
captain
come
to
Lisbon
,
he
find
mean
,
by
some
of
the
english
merchant
there
,
to
send
over
,
not
the
order
only
,
but
a
full
account
of
my
story
,
to
a
merchant
at
London
,
who
represent
it
effectually
to
her
;
whereupon
,
she
not
only
deliver
the
money
,
but
out
of
her
own
pocket
send
the
Portugal
captain
a
very
handsome
present
for
his
humanity
and
charity
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
merchant
in
London
vest
this
hundred
pound
in
english
good
,
such
as
the
captain
have
writ
for
,
send
them
directly
to
him
at
Lisbon
,
and
he
bring
them
all
safe
to
me
to
the
Brasils
;
among
which
,
without
my
direction
(
for
I
be
too
young
in
my
business
to
think
of
them
)
<EOS>
he
have
take
care
to
have
all
sort
of
tool
,
iron
work
,
and
utensil
necessary
for
my
plantation
,
and
which
be
of
great
use
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
cargo
arrive
,
I
think
my
fortune
make
,
for
I
be
surprised
with
joy
of
it
;
and
my
good
steward
the
captain
have
lay
out
the
five
pound
which
my
friend
have
send
him
for
a
present
for
himself
,
to
purchase
,
and
bring
me
over
a
servant
under
bond
for
six
year
service
,
and
would
not
accept
of
any
consideration
,
except
a
little
tobacco
,
which
I
would
have
him
accept
,
be
of
my
own
produce
.
  
<EOS>
neither
be
this
all
;
but
my
good
be
all
english
manufacture
,
such
as
cloth
,
stuff
,
baize
,
and
thing
particularly
valuable
and
desirable
in
the
country
,
I
find
mean
to
sell
them
to
a
very
great
advantage
;
so
that
I
may
say
,
I
have
more
than
four
time
the
value
of
my
first
cargo
,
and
be
now
infinitely
beyond
my
poor
neighbour
,
I
mean
in
the
advancement
of
my
plantation
;
for
the
first
thing
I
do
,
I
buy
me
a
Negro
slave
,
and
an
european
servant
also
;
I
mean
another
besides
that
which
the
captain
bring
me
from
Lisbon
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
abuse
prosperity
be
oftentime
make
the
very
mean
of
our
great
adversity
,
so
be
it
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
the
next
year
with
great
success
in
my
plantation
:
I
raise
fifty
great
roll
of
tobacco
on
my
own
ground
,
more
than
I
have
dispose
of
for
necessary
among
my
neighbour
;
and
these
fifty
roll
,
be
each
of
above
a
hundred
weight
,
be
well
cure
and
lay
by
against
the
return
of
the
fleet
from
Lisbon
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
increase
in
business
and
in
wealth
,
my
head
begin
to
be
full
of
project
and
undertaking
beyond
my
reach
;
such
as
be
indeed
often
the
ruin
of
the
good
head
in
business
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
continue
in
the
station
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
<EOS>
,
I
have
room
for
all
the
happy
thing
to
have
yet
befall
me
,
for
which
my
father
so
earnestly
recommend
a
quiet
retired
life
,
and
of
which
he
have
so
sensibly
describe
the
middle
station
of
life
to
be
full
;
but
other
thing
attend
me
,
and
I
be
still
to
be
the
wilful
agent
of
all
my
own
misery
;
and
particularly
to
increase
my
fault
,
and
double
the
reflection
upon
myself
,
which
in
my
future
sorrow
I
should
have
leisure
to
make
;
all
these
miscarriage
be
procure
by
my
apparent
obstinate
adhere
to
my
foolish
inclination
of
wander
abroad
,
and
pursue
that
inclination
,
in
contradiction
to
the
clear
view
of
do
myself
good
in
a
fair
and
plain
pursuit
of
those
prospect
and
those
measure
of
life
,
which
nature
and
Providence
concur
to
present
me
with
,
and
to
make
my
duty
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
do
thus
in
my
break
away
from
my
parent
,
so
I
could
not
be
content
now
,
but
I
must
go
and
leave
the
happy
view
I
have
of
be
a
rich
and
thriving
man
in
my
new
plantation
,
only
to
pursue
a
rash
and
immoderate
desire
of
rise
faster
than
the
nature
of
the
thing
admit
;
and
thus
I
cast
myself
down
again
into
the
deep
gulf
of
human
misery
that
ever
man
fall
into
,
or
perhaps
could
be
consistent
with
life
and
a
state
of
health
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
to
come
then
by
just
degree
to
the
particular
of
this
part
of
my
story
;
you
may
suppose
,
that
have
now
live
almost
four
year
in
the
brasil
,
and
begin
to
thrive
and
prosper
very
well
upon
my
plantation
,
I
have
not
only
learn
the
language
,
but
have
contract
acquaintance
and
friendship
among
my
fellow
-
planter
,
as
well
as
among
the
merchant
at
St.
Salvadore
,
which
be
our
port
;
and
that
in
my
discourse
among
them
,
I
have
frequently
give
them
an
account
of
my
two
voyage
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
the
manner
of
trading
with
the
Negroes
there
,
and
how
easy
it
be
to
purchase
upon
the
coast
,
for
trifle
,
such
as
bead
,
toy
,
knife
,
scissar
,
hatchet
,
bit
of
glass
,
and
the
like
,
not
only
gold
-
dust
,
Guinea
grain
,
elephant
tooth
,
&
c.
but
Negroes
for
the
service
of
the
Brasils
in
great
number
.
  
<EOS>
They
listen
always
very
attentively
to
my
discourse
on
these
head
,
but
especially
to
that
part
which
relate
to
the
buying
negro
,
which
be
a
trade
at
that
time
not
only
not
far
enter
into
,
but
,
as
far
as
it
be
,
have
be
carry
on
by
the
Assientos
for
permission
of
the
king
of
Spain
and
Portugal
,
and
engross
in
the
public
,
so
that
few
Negroes
be
bring
,
and
those
excessive
dear
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
,
be
in
company
with
some
merchant
and
planter
of
my
acquaintance
,
and
talk
of
those
thing
very
earnestly
,
three
of
them
come
to
me
the
next
morning
,
and
tell
me
they
have
be
muse
very
much
upon
what
I
have
discourse
with
them
of
,
the
last
night
,
and
they
come
to
make
a
secret
proposal
to
me
;
and
after
enjoin
me
secrecy
,
they
tell
me
,
that
they
have
a
mind
to
fit
out
a
ship
to
to
Guinea
;
that
they
have
all
plantation
as
well
as
I
,
and
be
straiten
for
nothing
so
much
as
servant
;
that
as
it
be
a
trade
could
not
be
carry
on
,
because
they
could
not
publicly
sell
the
Negroes
when
they
come
home
,
so
they
desire
to
make
but
<EOS>
one
voyage
,
to
bring
the
Negroes
on
shore
privately
,
and
divide
them
among
their
own
plantation
;
and
in
a
word
,
the
question
be
,
whether
I
would
go
their
supercargo
in
the
ship
,
to
manage
the
trading
part
upon
the
coast
of
Guinea
?
<EOS>
and
they
offer
me
that
I
should
have
my
equal
share
of
the
Negroes
,
without
provide
any
part
of
the
stock
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
fair
proposal
,
it
must
be
confess
,
have
it
be
make
to
any
one
that
have
not
have
a
settlement
and
plantation
of
his
own
to
look
after
,
which
be
in
a
fair
way
of
come
to
be
very
considerable
,
and
with
a
good
stock
upon
it
.
<EOS>
but
for
me
,
that
be
thus
enter
and
establish
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
go
on
as
I
have
begin
,
for
three
or
four
year
more
,
and
to
have
send
for
the
other
hundred
pound
from
England
,
and
who
in
that
time
,
and
with
that
little
addition
,
could
scarce
have
fail
of
be
worth
three
or
four
thousand
pound
sterling
,
and
that
increase
too
;
for
me
to
think
of
such
a
voyage
,
be
the
most
preposterous
thing
that
ever
man
in
such
circumstance
could
be
guilty
of
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
,
that
be
bear
to
be
my
own
destroyer
,
could
no
more
resist
the
offer
,
than
I
could
restrain
my
first
rambling
design
,
when
my
father
's
good
counsel
be
lose
upon
me
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
tell
them
I
would
go
with
all
my
heart
,
if
they
would
undertake
to
look
alter
my
plantation
in
my
absence
,
and
would
dispose
of
it
to
such
as
I
should
direct
if
I
miscarry
.
<EOS>
this
they
all
engage
to
do
,
and
enter
into
writing
or
covenant
to
do
so
;
and
I
make
a
formal
will
,
dispose
of
my
plantation
and
effect
,
in
case
of
my
death
,
make
the
captain
of
the
ship
that
have
save
my
life
as
before
,
my
universal
heir
,
but
oblige
him
to
dispose
of
my
effect
as
I
have
direct
in
my
will
,
one
half
of
the
produce
be
to
himself
,
and
the
other
to
be
ship
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
take
all
possible
caution
to
preserve
my
effect
,
and
keep
up
my
plantation
:
have
I
use
half
as
much
prudence
to
have
look
into
my
own
interest
,
and
have
make
a
judgment
of
what
I
ought
to
have
do
,
and
not
to
have
do
,
I
have
certainly
never
go
away
from
so
prosperous
an
undertaking
,
leave
all
the
probable
view
of
a
thriving
circumstance
,
and
go
upon
a
voyage
to
sea
,
attend
with
all
its
common
hazard
;
to
say
nothing
of
the
reason
I
have
to
expect
particular
misfortune
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
hurry
on
,
and
obey
blindly
the
dictate
of
my
fancy
rather
than
my
reason
:
and
accordingly
the
ship
be
fit
out
,
and
the
cargo
furnish
,
and
all
thing
do
as
by
agreement
,
by
my
partner
in
the
voyage
,
I
go
on
board
in
an
evil
hour
,
the
1st
of
September
,
1650
,
be
the
same
day
eight
year
that
I
go
from
my
father
and
mother
at
Hull
,
in
order
to
act
the
rebel
to
their
authority
,
and
the
fool
to
my
own
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Our
ship
be
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
ton
burden
,
carry
six
gun
,
and
fourteen
man
,
besides
the
master
,
his
boy
,
and
myself
;
we
have
on
board
no
large
cargo
of
good
,
except
of
such
toy
as
be
fit
for
our
trade
with
the
Negroes
,
such
as
bead
,
bit
of
glass
,
shell
,
and
odd
trifle
,
especially
little
looking
-
glass
,
knife
,
scissar
,
hatchet
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
day
I
go
on
board
we
set
sail
,
stand
away
to
the
northward
upon
our
own
coast
,
with
design
to
stretch
over
for
the
african
coast
;
when
they
come
about
10
or
12
degree
of
northern
latitude
,
which
it
seem
be
the
manner
of
their
course
in
those
day
.
<EOS>
We
have
very
good
weather
,
only
excessive
hot
,
all
the
way
upon
our
own
coast
,
till
we
make
the
height
of
Cape
St.
Augustino
,
from
whence
keep
farther
off
at
sea
<EOS>
we
lose
sight
of
land
,
and
steer
as
if
we
be
bind
for
the
isle
Fernand
de
Noronha
,
hold
our
course
N.E.
by
N.
and
leave
those
isle
on
the
east
.
<EOS>
in
this
course
we
pass
the
line
in
about
twelve
day
time
,
and
be
by
our
last
observation
in
7
degree
22
min
.
<EOS>
northern
latitude
,
when
a
violent
tornado
or
hurricane
take
us
quite
out
of
our
knowledge
<EOS>
;
it
begin
from
the
south
-
east
,
come
about
to
the
north
-
west
,
and
then
settle
into
the
north
-
east
,
from
whence
it
blow
in
such
a
terrible
manner
,
that
for
twelve
day
together
we
could
do
nothing
but
drive
;
and
scud
away
before
it
,
let
it
carry
us
whither
ever
fate
and
the
fury
of
the
wind
direct
;
and
during
these
twelve
day
,
I
need
not
say
that
I
expect
every
day
to
be
swallow
up
,
nor
indeed
do
any
in
the
ship
expect
to
save
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
distress
,
we
have
,
besides
the
terror
of
the
storm
,
one
of
our
man
die
of
the
calenture
,
and
one
man
and
the
boy
wash
overboard
;
about
the
twelfth
day
the
weather
abate
a
little
,
the
master
make
an
observation
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
find
that
he
be
in
about
11
degree
north
latitude
,
but
that
he
be
22
degree
of
longitude
difference
west
from
Cape
St.
Augustino
;
so
that
he
find
he
be
get
upon
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
or
the
north
part
of
Brasil
,
beyond
the
river
Amazones
,
toward
that
of
the
river
Oronoque
,
<EOS>
commonly
call
the
Great
River
,
and
begin
to
consult
with
me
what
course
he
should
take
,
for
the
ship
be
leaky
and
very
much
disabled
,
and
he
be
go
directly
back
to
the
coast
of
Brasil
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
positively
against
that
,
and
look
over
the
chart
of
the
sea
coast
of
America
with
him
<EOS>
we
conclude
there
be
no
inhabit
country
for
us
to
have
recourse
to
,
till
we
come
within
the
circle
of
the
Caribbee
island
,
and
therefore
resolve
to
stand
away
for
Barbadoes
,
which
by
keep
off
at
sea
,
to
avoid
the
indraft
of
the
bay
or
gulf
of
Mexico
,
we
may
easily
perform
,
as
we
hope
,
in
about
fifteen
day
sail
;
whereas
we
could
not
possibly
make
our
voyage
to
the
coast
of
Africa
without
some
assistance
,
both
to
our
ship
and
to
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
design
we
change
our
course
,
and
steer
away
N.W.
by
W.
in
order
to
reach
some
of
our
english
island
,
where
I
hope
for
relief
;
but
our
voyage
be
otherwise
determine
;
for
be
in
the
latitude
of
12
deg
.
<EOS>
18
min
.
<EOS>
a
second
storm
come
upon
us
,
which
carry
us
away
with
the
same
impetuosity
westward
,
and
drive
us
so
out
of
the
very
way
of
all
human
commerce
,
that
have
all
our
life
be
save
,
as
to
the
sea
,
we
be
rather
in
danger
of
be
devour
by
savage
than
ever
return
to
our
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
distress
,
the
wind
still
blow
very
hard
,
one
of
our
man
early
in
the
morning
cry
out
,
Land
!
<EOS>
and
we
have
no
sooner
run
out
of
the
cabin
to
look
out
in
hope
of
see
whereabout
in
the
world
we
be
,
but
the
ship
strike
upon
a
sand
,
and
in
a
moment
,
her
motion
be
so
stop
,
the
sea
break
over
her
in
such
a
manner
,
that
we
expect
we
should
all
have
perish
immediately
;
and
we
be
immediately
drive
into
our
close
quarter
to
shelter
us
from
the
very
foam
and
spray
of
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
for
any
one
,
who
have
not
be
in
the
like
condition
,
to
describe
or
conceive
the
consternation
of
man
in
such
circumstance
;
we
know
nothing
where
we
be
,
or
upon
what
land
it
be
we
be
drive
,
whether
an
island
or
the
main
,
whether
inhabit
or
not
inhabit
;
and
as
the
rage
of
the
wind
be
still
great
,
though
rather
less
than
at
first
,
we
could
not
so
much
as
hope
to
have
the
ship
hold
many
minute
without
break
in
piece
,
unless
the
wind
by
a
kind
of
miracle
should
turn
immediately
about
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
sit
look
one
upon
another
,
and
expect
death
every
moment
,
and
every
man
act
accordingly
,
as
prepare
for
another
world
,
for
there
be
little
or
nothing
more
for
us
to
do
in
this
;
that
which
be
our
present
comfort
,
and
all
the
comfort
we
have
,
be
,
that
,
contrary
to
our
expectation
,
the
ship
do
not
break
yet
,
and
that
the
master
say
the
wind
begin
to
abate
.
  
<EOS>
now
though
we
think
that
the
wind
do
a
little
abate
,
yet
the
ship
have
thus
strike
upon
the
sand
,
and
stick
too
fast
for
us
to
expect
her
get
off
,
we
be
in
a
dreadful
condition
indeed
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
think
of
save
our
life
as
well
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
boat
at
our
stern
,
just
before
the
storm
;
but
she
be
first
stave
by
dash
against
the
ship
's
rudder
,
and
in
the
next
place
she
break
away
,
and
either
sink
or
be
drive
off
to
sea
;
so
there
be
no
hope
from
her
.
<EOS>
We
have
another
boat
on
board
,
but
how
to
get
her
off
into
the
sea
be
a
doubtful
thing
;
however
,
there
be
no
room
to
debate
,
for
we
fancy
the
ship
would
break
in
piece
every
minute
,
and
some
tell
us
she
be
actually
break
already
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
distress
,
the
mate
of
our
vessel
lay
hold
of
the
boat
,
and
with
the
help
of
the
rest
of
the
man
they
get
her
sling
over
the
ship
's
side
,
and
get
all
into
her
,
let
go
,
and
commit
ourselves
,
be
eleven
in
number
,
to
God
's
mercy
and
the
wild
sea
;
for
though
the
storm
be
abate
considerably
,
yet
the
sea
go
dreadful
high
upon
the
shore
,
and
may
well
be
call
den
wild
zee
,
as
the
Dutch
call
the
sea
in
a
storm
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
our
case
be
very
dismal
indeed
;
for
we
all
see
plainly
,
that
the
sea
go
so
high
,
that
the
boat
could
not
live
,
and
that
we
should
be
inevitably
drown
.
<EOS>
as
to
make
sail
,
we
have
none
,
nor
,
if
we
have
,
could
we
have
do
any
thing
with
it
;
so
we
work
at
the
oar
towards
the
land
,
though
with
heavy
heart
,
like
man
go
to
execution
;
for
we
all
know
,
that
when
the
boat
come
nearer
the
shore
,
she
would
be
dash
into
a
thousand
piece
by
the
breach
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
commit
our
soul
to
God
in
the
most
earnest
manner
;
and
the
wind
drive
us
towards
the
shore
,
we
hasten
our
destruction
with
our
own
hand
,
pull
as
well
as
we
could
towards
land
.
  
<EOS>
what
the
shore
be
,
whether
rock
or
sand
,
whether
steep
or
shoal
,
we
know
not
;
the
only
hope
that
could
rationally
give
us
the
least
shadow
of
expectation
,
be
,
if
we
may
happen
into
some
bay
or
gulf
,
or
the
mouth
of
some
river
,
where
,
by
great
chance
,
we
may
have
run
our
boat
in
,
or
get
under
the
lee
of
the
land
,
and
perhaps
make
smooth
water
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
of
this
appear
;
but
as
we
make
near
and
nearer
the
shore
,
the
land
look
more
frightful
than
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
row
,
or
rather
drive
about
a
league
and
a
half
,
as
we
reckon
it
,
a
rage
wave
,
mountain
-
like
,
come
roll
astern
of
us
,
and
plainly
have
us
expect
the
coup
-
de
-
grace
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
it
take
us
with
such
a
fury
,
that
it
overset
the
boat
at
once
;
and
separate
us
as
well
from
the
boat
,
as
from
one
another
,
give
us
not
time
hardly
to
say
o
God
!
<EOS>
for
we
be
all
swallow
up
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
describe
the
confusion
of
thought
which
I
feel
when
I
sink
into
the
water
;
for
though
I
swam
very
well
,
yet
I
could
not
deliver
myself
from
the
wave
so
as
to
draw
breath
,
till
that
wave
have
drive
me
,
or
rather
carry
me
a
vast
way
on
towards
the
shore
,
and
have
spend
itself
,
go
back
,
and
leave
me
upon
the
land
almost
dry
,
but
half
dead
with
the
water
I
take
in
.
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
presence
of
mind
as
well
as
<EOS>
breath
leave
,
that
,
see
myself
nearer
the
main
land
than
I
expect
,
I
get
upon
my
foot
,
and
endeavour
to
make
on
towards
the
land
as
fast
as
I
could
,
before
another
wave
should
return
,
and
take
me
up
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
it
be
impossible
to
avoid
it
;
for
I
see
the
sea
come
after
me
as
high
as
a
great
hill
,
and
as
furious
as
an
enemy
which
I
have
no
means
or
strength
to
contend
with
;
my
business
be
to
hold
my
breath
,
and
raise
myself
upon
the
water
,
if
I
could
;
and
so
by
swim
to
preserve
my
breathing
,
and
pilot
myself
towards
the
shore
,
if
possible
;
my
great
concern
now
be
,
that
the
sea
,
as
it
would
carry
me
a
great
way
towards
the
shore
when
it
come
on
,
may
not
carry
me
back
again
with
it
when
it
give
back
towards
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
the
wave
that
come
upon
me
again
,
bury
me
at
once
twenty
or
thirty
foot
deep
in
its
own
body
;
and
I
could
feel
myself
carry
with
a
mighty
force
and
swiftness
towards
the
shore
a
very
great
way
;
but
I
hold
my
breath
,
and
assist
myself
to
swim
still
forward
with
all
my
might
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
burst
with
hold
my
breath
,
<EOS>
when
,
as
I
feel
myself
rise
up
,
so
,
to
my
immediate
relief
,
I
find
my
head
and
hand
shoot
out
above
the
surface
of
the
water
;
and
though
it
be
not
two
second
of
time
that
I
could
keep
myself
so
,
yet
it
relieve
me
greatly
,
give
me
breath
and
new
courage
.
<EOS>
I
be
cover
again
with
water
a
good
while
,
but
not
so
long
<EOS>
but
I
hold
it
out
;
and
find
the
water
have
spend
itself
,
and
begin
to
return
,
I
strike
forward
against
the
return
of
the
wave
,
and
feel
ground
again
with
my
foot
.
<EOS>
I
stand
still
a
few
moment
to
recover
breath
,
and
till
the
water
go
from
me
,
and
then
take
to
my
heel
,
and
run
with
what
strength
I
have
farth
towards
the
shore
.
<EOS>
but
neither
would
this
deliver
me
from
the
fury
of
the
sea
,
which
come
pour
in
after
me
again
;
and
twice
more
I
be
lift
up
by
the
wave
and
carry
forwards
as
before
,
the
shore
be
very
flat
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
time
of
these
two
have
well
near
be
fatal
to
me
;
for
the
sea
have
hurry
me
along
as
before
,
land
me
,
or
rather
dash
me
against
a
piece
of
a
rock
,
and
that
with
such
force
,
as
it
leave
me
senseless
,
and
indeed
helpless
,
as
to
my
own
deliverance
;
for
the
blow
take
my
side
and
breast
,
beat
the
breath
as
it
be
quite
out
of
my
body
;
and
have
it
return
again
immediately
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
be
strangle
in
the
water
;
but
I
recover
a
little
before
the
return
of
the
wave
,
and
see
I
should
be
cover
again
with
the
water
,
I
resolve
to
hold
fast
by
a
piece
of
the
rock
,
and
so
to
hold
my
breath
,
if
possible
,
till
the
wave
go
back
.
<EOS>
now
as
the
wave
be
not
so
high
as
at
first
,
be
near
land
,
I
hold
my
hold
till
the
wave
abate
,
and
then
fetch
another
run
,
which
bring
me
so
near
the
shore
,
that
the
next
wave
,
though
it
go
over
me
,
yet
do
not
so
swallow
me
up
as
to
carry
me
away
;
and
the
next
run
I
take
<EOS>
I
get
to
the
main
land
,
where
,
to
my
great
comfort
,
I
clamber
up
the
clift
of
the
shore
,
and
sit
me
down
upon
the
grass
,
free
from
danger
,
and
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
land
,
and
safe
on
shore
,
and
begin
to
look
up
and
thank
God
that
my
life
be
save
in
a
case
wherein
there
be
some
minute
before
scarce
any
room
to
hope
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
impossible
to
express
to
the
life
what
the
ecstasy
and
transport
of
the
soul
be
,
when
it
be
so
save
,
as
I
may
say
,
out
of
the
very
grave
;
and
I
do
not
wonder
now
at
that
custom
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
when
a
malefactor
,
who
have
the
halter
about
his
neck
,
be
tie
up
,
and
just
go
to
be
turn
off
,
and
have
a
reprieve
bring
to
him
:
I
say
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
they
bring
a
surgeon
with
it
,
to
let
him
blood
<EOS>
that
very
moment
they
tell
him
of
it
,
that
the
surprise
may
not
drive
the
animal
spirit
from
the
heart
,
and
overwhelm
him
:
       
for
sudden
joy
,
like
griefs
,
confound
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
about
on
the
shore
,
lift
up
my
hand
and
my
whole
being
,
as
I
may
say
,
wrapt
up
in
the
contemplation
of
my
deliverance
,
make
a
thousand
gesture
and
motion
which
I
can
not
describe
;
reflect
upon
all
my
comrade
that
be
drown
,
and
that
there
should
not
be
one
soul
save
but
myself
;
for
,
as
for
them
,
I
never
see
them
afterwards
,
or
any
sign
of
them
,
except
three
of
their
hat
,
one
cap
,
and
two
shoe
that
be
not
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
I
cast
my
eye
to
the
strand
vessel
,
when
the
breach
and
troth
of
the
sea
be
so
big
,
I
could
hardly
see
it
,
it
lie
so
far
off
,
and
consider
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
be
it
possible
I
could
get
on
shore
!
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
solace
my
mind
with
the
comfortable
part
of
my
condition
,
I
begin
to
look
round
me
,
to
see
what
kind
of
place
I
be
in
,
and
what
be
next
to
be
do
;
and
I
soon
find
my
comfort
abate
,
and
that
in
a
word
I
have
a
dreadful
deliverance
;
for
I
be
wet
,
have
no
clothe
to
shift
me
,
nor
any
thing
either
to
eat
or
drink
to
comfort
me
;
neither
do
I
see
any
prospect
before
me
,
but
that
of
perish
with
hunger
,
or
be
devour
by
wild
beast
;
and
that
which
be
particularly
afflict
to
me
,
be
,
that
I
have
no
weapon
either
to
hunt
and
kill
any
creature
for
my
sustenance
,
or
to
defend
myself
against
any
other
creature
that
may
desire
to
kill
me
for
theirs
;
in
a
word
,
I
have
nothing
about
me
but
a
knife
,
a
tobacco
pipe
,
and
a
little
tobacco
in
a
box
;
this
be
all
my
provision
,
and
this
throw
me
into
terrible
agony
of
mind
,
that
for
a
while
I
run
about
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
night
come
upon
me
,
I
begin
with
a
heavy
heart
to
consider
what
would
be
my
lot
if
there
be
any
ravenous
beast
in
that
country
,
see
at
night
they
always
come
abroad
for
their
prey
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
remedy
that
offer
to
my
thought
at
that
time
,
be
,
to
get
up
into
a
thick
bushy
tree
like
a
fir
,
but
thorny
,
which
grow
near
me
,
and
where
I
resolve
to
sit
all
night
,
and
consider
the
next
day
what
death
I
should
die
,
for
<EOS>
as
yet
I
see
no
prospect
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
walk
about
a
furlong
from
the
shore
,
to
see
if
I
could
find
any
fresh
water
to
drink
,
which
I
do
,
to
my
great
joy
;
and
have
drink
,
and
put
a
little
tobacco
in
my
mouth
to
prevent
hunger
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
the
tree
,
and
get
up
into
it
,
endeavour
to
place
myself
<EOS>
so
,
as
that
if
I
should
sleep
<EOS>
I
may
not
fall
;
and
have
cut
me
a
short
stick
,
like
a
truncheon
,
for
my
defence
,
I
take
up
my
lodging
,
and
have
be
excessively
fatigue
,
I
fall
fast
asleep
,
and
sleep
as
comfortably
as
,
I
believe
,
few
could
have
do
in
my
condition
,
and
find
myself
the
most
refreshed
with
it
that
I
think
I
ever
be
on
such
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
wake
it
be
broad
day
,
the
weather
clear
,
and
the
storm
abate
,
so
that
the
sea
do
not
rage
and
swell
as
before
;
but
that
which
surprise
me
most
be
,
that
the
ship
be
lift
off
in
the
night
from
the
sand
where
she
lie
,
by
the
swelling
of
the
tide
,
and
be
drive
up
almost
as
far
as
the
rock
which
I
first
mention
,
where
I
have
be
so
bruise
by
the
dash
me
against
it
;
this
be
within
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
where
I
be
,
and
the
ship
seem
to
stand
upright
still
,
I
wish
myself
on
board
,
that
,
at
least
,
I
may
save
some
necessary
thing
for
my
use
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
down
from
my
apartment
in
the
tree
,
I
look
about
me
again
,
and
the
first
thing
I
find
be
the
boat
,
which
lie
as
the
wind
and
the
sea
have
toss
her
up
upon
the
land
,
about
two
mile
on
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
I
walk
as
far
as
I
could
upon
the
shore
to
have
get
to
her
,
but
find
a
neck
or
inlet
of
water
between
me
and
the
boat
,
which
be
about
half
a
mile
broad
;
so
I
come
back
for
the
present
,
be
more
intent
upon
get
at
the
ship
,
where
I
hope
to
find
something
for
my
present
subsistence
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
after
noon
I
find
the
sea
very
calm
,
and
the
tide
ebb
so
far
out
,
that
I
could
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
ship
;
and
here
I
find
a
fresh
renewing
of
my
grief
:
for
I
see
evidently
,
that
if
we
have
keep
on
board
,
we
have
be
all
safe
,
that
be
to
say
,
we
have
all
get
safe
on
shore
,
and
I
have
not
be
so
miserable
as
to
be
leave
entirely
destitute
of
all
comfort
and
company
,
as
I
now
be
.
<EOS>
this
force
tear
from
my
eye
again
;
but
as
there
be
little
relief
in
that
,
I
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
get
to
the
ship
;
so
I
pull
off
my
clothe
,
for
the
weather
be
hot
to
extremity
,
and
take
the
water
;
but
when
I
come
to
the
ship
,
my
difficulty
be
still
great
to
know
how
to
get
on
board
;
for
as
she
lie
aground
,
and
high
out
of
the
water
,
there
be
nothing
within
my
reach
to
lay
hold
of
.
<EOS>
I
swam
round
her
twice
,
and
the
second
time
I
spy
a
small
piece
of
a
rope
,
which
I
wonder
I
do
not
see
at
first
,
hang
down
by
the
fore
-
chain
so
low
as
that
with
great
difficulty
I
get
hold
of
it
,
and
by
the
help
of
that
rope
get
up
into
the
forecastle
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
here
I
find
that
the
ship
be
bulge
,
and
have
a
great
deal
of
water
in
her
hold
,
but
that
she
lie
so
on
the
side
of
a
bank
of
hard
sand
,
or
rather
earth
,
and
her
stern
lie
lift
up
upon
the
bank
,
and
her
head
low
almost
to
the
water
:
by
this
mean
all
her
quarter
be
free
,
and
all
that
be
in
that
part
be
dry
;
for
you
may
be
sure
my
first
work
be
to
search
and
to
see
what
be
spoil
and
what
be
free
;
and
first
I
find
that
all
the
ship
's
provision
be
dry
and
untouched
by
the
water
;
and
be
very
well
disposed
to
eat
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
the
bread
-
room
and
fill
my
pocket
with
bisket
,
and
eat
it
as
I
go
about
other
thing
,
for
I
have
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
I
also
find
some
rum
in
the
great
cabin
,
of
which
I
take
a
large
drain
,
and
which
I
have
indeed
need
enough
of
to
spirit
me
for
what
be
before
me
.
<EOS>
now
I
want
nothing
but
a
boat
to
furnish
myself
with
many
thing
which
I
foresaw
would
be
very
necessary
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
sit
still
and
wish
for
what
be
not
to
be
have
;
and
this
extremity
rouse
my
application
.
<EOS>
We
have
several
spare
yard
,
and
two
or
three
large
spar
of
wood
,
and
a
spare
topmast
or
two
in
the
ship
;
I
resolve
to
fall
to
work
with
these
,
and
fling
as
many
of
them
overboard
as
I
could
manage
of
their
weight
,
tie
every
one
with
a
rope
,
that
they
may
not
drive
away
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
I
go
down
the
ship
's
side
,
and
pull
them
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
tie
four
of
them
fast
together
at
both
end
as
well
as
I
could
,
in
the
form
of
a
raft
,
and
lay
two
or
three
short
piece
of
plank
upon
them
crossway
,
I
find
I
could
walk
upon
it
very
well
,
but
that
it
be
not
able
to
bear
any
great
weight
,
the
piece
be
too
light
;
so
I
go
to
work
,
and
with
the
carpenter
's
see
I
cut
a
spare
topmast
into
three
length
,
and
add
them
to
my
raft
,
with
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
pain
;
but
hope
of
furnish
myself
with
necessary
encourage
me
to
go
beyond
what
I
should
have
be
able
to
have
do
upon
another
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
My
raft
be
now
strong
enough
to
bear
any
reasonable
weight
;
my
next
care
be
what
to
load
it
with
,
and
how
to
preserve
what
I
lay
upon
it
from
the
surf
of
the
sea
;
but
I
be
not
long
consider
this
:
I
first
lay
all
the
plank
or
board
upon
it
that
I
could
get
,
and
have
consider
well
what
I
most
want
,
I
first
get
three
of
the
seaman
's
chest
,
which
I
have
break
open
and
empty
,
and
lower
them
down
upon
my
raft
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
I
fill
with
provision
,
viz
.
<EOS>
bread
,
rice
,
three
dutch
cheese
,
five
piece
of
dry
goat
's
flesh
,
which
we
live
much
upon
,
and
a
little
remainder
of
european
corn
which
have
be
lay
by
for
some
fowl
which
we
bring
to
sea
with
us
,
but
the
fowl
be
kill
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
barley
and
wheat
together
,
but
,
to
my
great
disappointment
,
I
find
afterwards
that
the
rat
have
eat
or
spoil
it
all
.
<EOS>
as
for
liquor
,
I
find
several
case
of
bottle
belong
to
our
skipper
,
in
which
be
some
cordial
water
,
and
in
all
above
five
or
six
gallon
of
rack
:
<EOS>
these
I
stow
by
themselves
,
there
be
no
need
to
put
them
into
the
chest
,
nor
no
room
for
them
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
do
this
,
I
find
the
tide
begin
to
flow
,
though
very
calm
,
and
I
have
the
mortification
to
see
my
coat
,
shirt
,
and
waistcoat
,
which
I
have
leave
on
shore
upon
the
sand
,
swim
away
;
as
for
my
breech
,
which
be
only
linen
,
and
open
-
kneed
,
I
swam
on
board
in
them
and
my
stocking
:
however
,
this
put
me
upon
rummage
for
clothe
,
of
which
I
find
enough
,
but
take
no
more
than
I
want
for
present
use
,
for
I
have
other
thing
which
my
eye
be
more
upon
;
as
,
first
,
tool
to
work
with
on
shore
;
and
it
be
after
long
search
that
I
find
out
the
carpenter
's
chest
,
which
be
indeed
a
very
useful
prize
to
me
,
and
much
more
valuable
than
a
ship
-
loading
of
gold
would
have
be
at
that
time
:
I
get
it
down
to
my
raft
,
even
whole
as
it
be
,
without
lose
time
to
look
into
it
,
for
I
know
in
general
what
it
contain
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
care
be
for
some
ammunition
and
arm
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
very
good
fowling
-
piece
in
the
great
cabin
,
and
two
pistol
:
these
I
secure
first
,
with
some
powder
horn
,
and
a
small
bag
of
shot
,
and
two
old
rusty
sword
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
three
barrel
of
powder
in
the
ship
,
but
know
not
where
our
gunner
have
stow
them
;
but
with
much
search
I
find
them
,
two
of
them
dry
and
good
,
the
third
have
take
water
;
those
two
I
get
to
my
raft
,
with
the
arm
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
myself
pretty
well
freight
,
and
begin
to
think
how
I
should
get
to
shore
with
them
,
have
neither
sail
,
oar
,
or
rudder
,
and
the
least
capful
of
wind
would
have
overset
all
my
navigation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
three
encouragement
:
1
.
<EOS>
a
smooth
,
calm
sea
;
2
.
<EOS>
the
tide
rise
and
set
in
to
the
shore
;
3
.
<EOS>
what
little
wind
there
be
blow
me
towards
the
land
:
and
thus
,
have
find
two
or
three
broken
oar
belong
to
the
boat
,
and
besides
the
tool
which
be
in
the
chest
,
I
find
two
saw
,
an
axe
,
and
a
hammer
;
and
with
this
cargo
I
put
to
sea
:
for
a
mile
,
or
thereabout
,
my
raft
go
very
well
,
only
that
I
find
it
drive
a
little
distant
from
the
place
where
I
have
land
before
,
by
which
I
perceive
that
there
be
some
indraft
of
the
water
,
and
consequently
I
hope
to
find
some
creek
or
river
there
,
which
I
may
make
use
of
as
a
port
to
get
to
land
with
my
cargo
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
imagine
,
so
it
be
:
there
appear
before
me
a
little
opening
of
the
land
,
and
I
find
a
strong
current
of
the
tide
set
into
it
,
<EOS>
so
I
guide
my
raft
as
well
as
I
could
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
;
but
here
I
have
like
to
have
suffer
a
second
shipwreck
,
which
,
if
I
have
,
I
think
verily
would
have
break
my
heart
;
for
know
nothing
of
the
coast
,
my
raft
run
aground
at
one
end
of
it
upon
a
shoal
,
and
not
be
aground
at
the
other
end
,
it
want
but
a
little
that
all
my
cargo
have
slip
off
towards
that
end
that
be
afloat
,
and
so
fallen
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
utmost
,
by
set
my
back
against
the
chest
,
to
keep
them
in
their
place
,
but
could
not
thrust
off
the
raft
with
all
my
strength
;
neither
durst
<EOS>
I
stir
from
the
posture
I
be
in
,
but
hold
up
the
chest
with
all
my
might
,
stand
in
that
manner
near
half
an
hour
,
in
which
time
the
rise
of
the
water
bring
me
a
little
more
upon
a
level
;
and
a
little
after
,
the
water
still
rise
,
my
raft
float
again
,
and
I
thrust
her
off
with
the
oar
I
have
into
the
channel
;
and
then
drive
up
higher
,
I
at
length
find
myself
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
,
with
land
on
both
side
,
and
a
strong
current
or
tide
run
up
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
both
side
for
a
proper
place
to
get
to
shore
;
for
I
be
not
willing
to
be
drive
too
high
up
the
river
,
hope
in
time
to
see
some
ship
at
sea
,
and
therefore
resolve
to
place
myself
as
near
the
coast
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
I
spy
a
little
cove
on
the
right
shore
of
the
creek
,
to
which
,
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
,
I
guide
my
raft
,
and
at
last
get
so
near
,
as
that
,
reach
ground
with
my
oar
,
I
could
thrust
her
directly
in
;
but
here
I
have
like
to
have
dip
all
my
cargo
in
the
sea
again
;
for
that
shore
lie
pretty
steep
,
that
be
to
say
sloping
,
there
be
no
place
to
land
,
but
where
one
end
of
the
float
,
if
it
run
on
shore
,
would
lie
so
high
,
and
the
other
sink
lower
as
before
,
that
it
would
endanger
my
cargo
again
:
all
that
I
could
do
,
be
to
wait
till
the
tide
be
at
the
high
,
keep
the
raft
with
my
oar
like
an
anchor
to
hold
the
side
of
it
fast
to
the
shore
,
near
a
flat
piece
of
ground
,
which
I
expect
the
water
would
flow
over
;
and
so
it
do
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
find
water
enough
,
for
my
raft
draw
about
a
foot
of
water
,
I
thrust
her
on
upon
that
flat
piece
of
ground
,
and
there
fasten
or
moor
her
by
stick
my
two
broken
oar
into
the
ground
;
one
on
one
side
near
one
end
,
and
one
on
the
other
side
near
the
other
end
;
and
thus
I
lay
till
the
water
ebb
away
,
and
leave
my
raft
and
all
my
cargo
safe
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
work
be
to
view
the
country
,
and
seek
a
proper
place
for
my
habitation
,
and
where
to
stow
my
good
,
to
secure
them
from
whatever
may
happen
.
<EOS>
where
I
be
I
yet
know
not
;
whether
on
the
continent
or
on
an
island
,
whether
inhabit
or
not
inhabit
,
whether
in
danger
of
wild
beast
or
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
hill
not
above
a
mile
from
me
,
which
rise
up
very
steep
and
high
,
and
which
seem
to
overtop
some
other
hill
which
,
lie
as
in
a
ridge
from
it
northward
:
I
take
out
one
of
the
fowling
-
piece
,
and
one
of
the
pistol
,
and
an
horn
of
powder
,
and
thus
armed
I
travel
for
discovery
up
to
the
top
of
that
hill
,
where
,
after
I
have
with
great
labour
and
difficulty
get
to
the
top
,
I
see
my
fate
to
my
great
affliction
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
I
be
in
an
island
environ
every
way
with
the
sea
,
no
land
to
be
see
,
except
some
rock
which
lie
a
great
way
off
,
and
two
small
island
less
than
this
,
which
lie
about
three
league
to
the
west
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
also
that
the
island
I
be
in
be
barren
,
and
,
as
I
see
good
reason
to
believe
,
uninhabite
,
except
by
wild
beast
,
of
whom
,
however
,
I
see
none
;
yet
I
see
abundance
of
fowl
,
but
know
not
their
kind
;
neither
when
I
kill
them
could
I
tell
what
be
fit
for
food
,
and
what
not
.
<EOS>
at
my
come
back
I
shoot
at
a
great
bird
,
which
I
see
sit
upon
a
tree
on
the
side
of
a
great
wood
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
the
first
gun
that
have
be
fire
there
since
the
creation
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
fire
,
but
from
all
part
of
the
wood
there
arise
an
innumerable
number
of
fowl
of
many
sort
,
make
a
confuse
screaming
,
and
cry
every
one
accord
to
his
usual
note
;
but
not
one
of
them
of
any
kind
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
creature
I
kill
,
I
take
it
to
be
a
kind
of
a
hawk
,
its
colour
and
beak
resemble
it
,
but
have
no
talon
or
claw
more
than
common
;
its
flesh
be
carrion
,
and
fit
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
content
with
this
discovery
,
I
come
back
to
my
raft
,
and
fall
to
work
to
bring
my
cargo
on
shore
,
which
take
me
up
the
rest
of
that
day
;
and
what
to
do
with
myself
at
night
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
nor
indeed
where
to
rest
;
for
I
be
afraid
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
,
not
know
but
some
wild
beast
may
devour
me
;
though
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
there
be
really
no
need
for
those
fear
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
barricado
myself
round
with
the
chest
and
board
that
I
have
bring
on
shore
,
and
make
a
kind
of
a
hut
for
that
night
's
lodging
.
<EOS>
as
for
food
,
I
yet
see
not
which
way
to
supply
myself
,
except
that
I
have
see
two
or
three
creature
like
hare
run
out
of
the
wood
where
I
shoot
the
fowl
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
consider
,
that
I
may
yet
get
a
great
many
thing
out
of
the
ship
,
which
would
be
useful
to
me
,
and
particularly
some
of
the
rigging
and
sail
,
and
such
other
thing
as
may
come
to
land
,
and
I
resolve
to
make
another
voyage
on
board
the
vessel
,
if
possible
;
and
as
I
know
that
the
first
storm
that
blew
must
necessarily
break
her
all
in
piece
,
I
resolve
to
set
all
other
thing
apart
,
till
I
get
every
thing
out
of
the
ship
that
I
could
get
.
<EOS>
then
I
call
a
council
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
my
thought
,
whether
I
should
take
back
the
raft
;
but
this
appear
impracticable
;
so
I
resolve
to
go
as
before
,
when
the
tide
be
down
,
and
I
do
so
,
only
that
I
strip
before
I
go
from
my
hut
,
have
nothing
on
but
a
check
shirt
and
a
pair
of
linen
trowser
,
and
a
pair
of
pump
on
my
foot
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
on
board
the
ship
,
as
before
,
and
prepare
a
second
raft
;
and
have
have
experience
of
the
first
,
I
neither
make
this
so
unwieldy
,
nor
load
it
so
hard
,
<EOS>
but
yet
I
bring
away
several
thing
very
useful
to
me
;
as
first
,
in
the
carpenter
's
store
I
find
two
or
three
bag
full
of
nail
and
spike
,
a
great
screw
-
jack
,
a
dozen
or
two
of
hatchet
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
most
useful
thing
call
a
grindstone
;
all
these
I
secure
,
together
with
several
thing
belong
to
the
gunner
,
particularly
two
or
three
iron
crow
,
and
two
barrel
of
musket
-
bullet
,
seven
musket
,
and
another
fowling
-
piece
,
with
some
small
quantity
of
powder
more
;
a
large
bag
full
of
small
shot
,
and
a
great
roll
of
sheet
lead
;
but
this
last
be
so
heavy
<EOS>
I
could
not
hoist
it
up
to
get
it
over
the
ship
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
besides
these
thing
,
I
take
all
the
man
's
clothe
that
I
could
find
,
and
a
spare
fore
-
topsail
,
hammock
,
and
some
bedding
;
and
with
this
I
load
my
second
raft
,
and
bring
them
all
safe
on
shore
,
to
my
very
great
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
under
some
apprehension
during
my
absence
from
the
land
,
that
at
least
my
provision
may
be
devour
on
shore
;
but
when
I
come
back
,
I
find
no
sign
of
any
visitor
,
only
there
sit
a
creature
like
a
wild
cat
upon
one
of
the
chest
,
which
,
when
I
come
towards
it
,
run
away
a
little
distance
,
and
then
stand
still
;
she
sit
very
composed
and
unconcerned
,
and
look
full
in
my
face
,
as
if
she
have
a
mind
to
be
acquaint
with
me
;
I
present
my
gun
at
her
,
but
as
she
do
not
understand
it
,
she
be
perfectly
unconcerned
at
it
,
nor
do
she
offer
to
stir
away
;
upon
which
I
toss
her
a
bit
of
biscuit
,
though
by
the
way
I
be
not
very
free
of
it
,
for
my
store
be
not
great
:
however
,
I
spare
her
a
bit
,
I
say
,
and
she
go
to
it
,
smell
of
it
,
and
eat
it
,
and
look
,
as
pleased
,
for
more
;
but
I
thank
her
,
and
could
spare
no
more
;
so
she
march
off
.
  
<EOS>
have
get
my
second
cargo
on
shore
,
though
I
be
fain
to
open
the
barrel
of
powder
,
and
bring
them
by
parcel
,
for
they
be
too
heavy
,
be
large
cask
,
I
go
to
work
to
make
me
a
little
tent
with
the
sail
and
some
pole
which
I
cut
for
that
purpose
;
and
into
this
tent
I
bring
every
thing
that
I
know
would
spoil
,
either
with
rain
or
sun
;
and
I
pile
all
the
empty
chest
and
cask
up
in
a
circle
<EOS>
round
the
tent
,
to
fortify
it
from
any
sudden
attempt
,
either
from
man
or
beast
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
this
,
I
block
up
the
door
of
the
tent
with
some
board
within
;
and
an
empty
chest
set
up
an
end
without
,
and
spread
one
of
the
bed
upon
the
ground
,
lay
my
two
pistol
just
at
my
head
,
and
my
gun
at
length
by
me
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
bed
for
the
first
time
,
and
sleep
very
quietly
all
night
,
for
I
be
very
weary
and
heavy
,
as
the
night
before
I
have
sleep
little
,
and
have
labour
very
hard
all
day
,
as
well
to
fetch
all
those
thing
from
the
ship
as
to
get
them
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
big
magazine
of
all
kind
now
that
ever
be
lay
up
,
I
believe
,
for
one
man
;
but
I
be
not
satisfied
still
;
for
while
the
ship
sit
upright
in
that
posture
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
ought
to
get
every
thing
out
of
her
that
I
could
;
so
every
day
at
low
water
<EOS>
I
go
on
board
,
and
bring
away
something
or
other
;
but
particularly
the
third
time
I
go
<EOS>
,
I
bring
away
as
much
of
the
rigging
as
I
could
,
as
also
all
the
small
rope
and
rope
-
twine
<EOS>
I
could
get
,
with
a
piece
of
spare
canvass
,
which
be
to
mend
the
sail
upon
occasion
,
and
the
barrel
of
wet
gunpowder
;
in
a
word
,
I
bring
away
all
the
sail
first
and
last
,
only
that
I
be
fain
to
cut
them
in
piece
,
and
bring
as
much
at
a
time
as
I
could
;
for
they
be
no
more
useful
to
be
sail
,
but
as
mere
canvass
only
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
comfort
me
more
still
,
be
,
that
at
last
of
all
,
after
I
have
make
five
or
six
such
voyage
as
these
,
and
think
I
have
nothing
more
to
expect
from
the
ship
that
be
worth
my
meddling
with
;
I
say
,
after
all
this
,
I
find
a
great
hogshead
of
bread
,
and
three
large
runlet
of
rum
or
spirit
,
and
a
box
of
sugar
,
and
a
barrel
of
fine
flower
<EOS>
;
this
be
surprising
to
me
,
because
I
have
give
over
expect
any
more
provision
,
except
what
be
spoil
by
the
water
:
I
soon
empty
the
hogshead
of
that
bread
,
and
wrap
it
up
,
parcel
by
parcel
,
in
piece
of
the
sail
,
which
I
cut
out
;
and
in
a
word
,
I
get
all
this
safe
on
shore
also
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
make
another
voyage
;
and
now
,
have
plunder
the
ship
of
what
be
portable
and
fit
to
hand
out
,
I
begin
with
the
cable
;
and
cut
the
great
cable
into
piece
,
such
as
I
could
move
,
I
get
two
cable
and
a
hawser
on
shore
,
with
all
the
iron
-
work
I
could
get
;
and
have
cut
down
the
spritsail
-
yard
,
and
the
mizen
-
yard
,
and
every
thing
I
could
to
make
a
large
raft
,
I
load
it
with
all
those
heavy
good
,
and
come
away
:
but
my
good
luck
begin
now
to
leave
me
;
for
this
raft
be
so
unwieldy
and
so
overladen
,
that
after
I
have
enter
the
little
cove
where
I
have
land
the
rest
of
my
good
,
not
be
able
to
guide
it
so
handily
as
I
do
the
other
,
it
overset
,
and
throw
me
and
all
my
cargo
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
it
be
no
great
harm
,
for
I
be
near
the
shore
;
but
as
to
my
cargo
,
it
be
great
part
of
it
<EOS>
lose
,
especially
the
iron
,
which
I
expect
would
have
be
of
great
use
to
me
:
however
,
when
the
tide
be
out
,
I
get
most
of
the
piece
of
cable
ashore
,
and
some
of
the
iron
,
though
with
infinite
labour
;
for
I
be
fain
to
dip
for
it
into
the
water
,
a
work
which
fatigue
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
go
every
day
on
board
,
and
bring
away
what
I
could
get
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
now
thirteen
day
on
shore
,
and
have
be
eleven
time
on
board
the
ship
;
in
which
time
I
have
bring
away
all
that
one
pair
of
hand
could
well
be
suppose
capable
to
bring
,
though
I
believe
,
verily
,
have
the
calm
weather
hold
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
bring
away
the
whole
ship
,
piece
by
piece
;
but
prepare
the
twelfth
time
to
go
on
board
,
I
find
the
wind
begin
to
rise
;
however
,
at
low
water
I
go
on
board
,
and
though
I
think
I
have
rummage
the
cabin
so
effectually
,
as
that
nothing
more
could
be
find
,
yet
I
discover
a
locker
with
drawer
in
it
,
in
one
of
which
I
find
two
or
three
razor
,
and
one
pair
of
large
scissar
,
with
some
ten
or
a
dozen
of
good
knife
and
fork
;
in
another
I
find
about
thirty
-
six
pound
value
in
money
,
some
european
coin
,
some
Brasil
,
some
piece
of
eight
,
some
gold
,
some
silver
.
  
<EOS>
I
smile
to
myself
at
the
sight
of
this
money
.
"
<EOS>
o
drug
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
aloud
,
"
what
art
thou
good
for
?
<EOS>
thou
art
not
worth
to
me
,
no
not
the
taking
off
of
the
ground
;
one
of
those
knife
be
worth
all
this
heap
;
I
have
no
manner
of
use
for
thee
;
even
remain
where
thou
art
,
and
go
to
the
bottom
as
a
creature
whose
life
be
not
worth
save
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
upon
second
thought
,
I
take
it
away
,
and
wrap
all
this
in
a
piece
of
canvass
,
I
begin
to
think
of
make
another
raft
;
but
while
I
be
prepare
this
,
I
find
the
sky
overcast
,
and
the
wind
begin
to
rise
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
blow
a
fresh
gale
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
It
presently
occur
to
me
,
that
it
be
in
vain
to
pretend
to
make
a
raft
with
the
wind
off
shore
,
and
that
it
be
my
business
to
be
go
before
the
tide
of
flood
begin
,
otherwise
I
may
not
be
able
to
reach
the
shore
at
all
;
accordingly
I
let
myself
down
into
the
water
,
and
swam
cross
the
channel
which
lie
between
the
ship
and
the
sand
,
and
even
that
with
difficulty
enough
,
partly
with
the
weight
of
thing
I
have
about
me
,
and
partly
the
roughness
of
the
water
,
for
the
wind
rise
very
hastily
,
and
before
it
be
quite
high
water
it
blow
a
storm
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
get
home
to
my
little
tent
,
where
I
lie
with
all
my
wealth
about
me
very
secure
.
<EOS>
It
blow
very
hard
all
that
night
,
and
in
the
morning
when
I
look
out
,
behold
no
more
ship
be
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
surprised
,
but
recover
myself
with
this
satisfactory
reflection
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
I
have
lose
no
time
,
nor
abate
no
diligence
to
get
every
thing
out
of
her
that
could
be
useful
to
me
,
and
that
indeed
there
be
little
leave
in
her
that
I
be
able
to
bring
away
,
if
I
have
have
more
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
give
over
any
more
thought
of
the
ship
,
or
of
any
thing
out
of
her
,
except
what
may
drive
on
shore
from
her
wreck
,
as
indeed
diver
piece
of
her
afterwards
do
;
but
those
thing
be
of
small
use
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
thought
be
now
wholly
employ
about
secure
myself
against
either
savage
,
if
any
should
appear
,
or
wild
beast
,
if
any
be
in
the
island
;
and
I
have
many
thought
of
the
method
how
to
do
this
,
and
what
kind
of
dwelling
to
make
;
whether
I
should
make
me
a
cave
in
the
earth
,
or
a
tent
upon
the
earth
:
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
I
resolve
upon
both
,
the
manner
and
description
of
which
it
may
not
be
improper
to
give
an
account
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
find
the
place
I
be
in
be
not
for
my
settlement
,
particularly
because
it
be
upon
a
low
moorish
ground
near
the
sea
,
and
I
believe
would
not
be
wholesome
,
and
more
particularly
because
there
be
no
fresh
water
near
it
;
so
I
resolve
to
find
a
more
healthy
and
more
convenient
spot
of
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
consult
several
thing
in
my
situation
which
I
find
would
be
proper
for
me
:
1st
,
Health
,
and
fresh
water
,
I
just
now
mention
,
2dly
,
Shelter
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
3dly
,
security
from
ravenous
creature
,
whether
man
or
beast
.
<EOS>
4thly
,
a
view
to
the
sea
,
that
,
if
God
send
any
ship
in
sight
,
I
may
not
lose
any
advantage
for
my
deliverance
,
of
which
I
be
not
willing
to
banish
all
my
expectation
yet
.
  
<EOS>
in
search
of
a
place
proper
for
this
,
I
find
a
little
plain
on
the
side
of
a
rise
hill
,
whose
front
towards
this
little
plain
be
steep
as
a
house
-
side
,
so
that
nothing
could
come
down
upon
me
from
the
top
:
on
the
side
of
this
rock
there
be
a
hollow
place
wear
a
little
way
in
like
the
entrance
or
door
of
a
cave
,
but
there
be
not
really
any
cave
or
way
into
the
rock
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
flat
of
the
green
,
just
before
this
hollow
place
,
I
resolve
to
pitch
my
tent
:
this
plain
be
not
above
an
hundred
yard
broad
,
and
about
twice
as
long
,
and
lie
like
a
green
before
my
door
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
descend
irregularly
every
way
down
into
the
low
ground
by
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
N.N.W.
side
of
the
hill
,
so
that
I
be
shelter
from
the
heat
every
day
,
till
it
come
to
a
w.
and
by
S.
sun
,
or
thereabout
,
which
in
those
country
be
near
the
setting
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
set
up
my
tent
,
I
draw
a
half
-
circle
before
the
hollow
place
,
which
take
in
about
ten
yard
in
its
semi
-
diameter
from
the
rock
,
and
twenty
yard
in
its
diameter
,
from
its
beginning
and
ending
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
half
circle
I
pitch
two
row
of
strong
stake
,
drive
them
into
the
ground
till
they
stand
very
firm
,
like
pile
,
the
big
end
be
out
of
the
ground
<EOS>
about
five
foot
and
a
half
,
and
sharpen
on
the
top
;
the
two
row
do
not
stand
above
six
inch
from
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
take
the
piece
of
cable
which
I
have
cut
in
the
ship
,
and
lay
them
in
row
one
upon
another
,
within
the
circle
between
these
two
row
of
stake
,
up
to
the
top
,
place
other
stake
in
the
inside
,
lean
against
them
,
about
two
foot
and
a
half
high
,
like
a
spur
to
a
post
;
and
this
fence
be
so
strong
,
that
neither
man
or
beast
could
get
into
it
or
over
it
<EOS>
:
this
cost
me
a
great
deal
of
time
and
labour
,
especially
to
cut
the
pile
in
the
wood
,
bring
them
to
the
place
,
and
drive
them
into
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
the
entrance
into
this
place
I
make
to
be
not
by
a
door
,
but
by
a
short
ladder
,
to
go
over
the
top
:
<EOS>
which
ladder
,
when
I
be
in
,
I
lift
over
after
me
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
be
completely
fence
in
,
and
fortify
,
as
I
think
,
from
all
the
world
,
and
consequently
sleep
secure
in
the
night
,
which
otherwise
I
could
not
have
do
,
though
,
as
it
appear
afterward
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
need
of
all
this
caution
from
the
enemy
that
I
apprehend
danger
from
.
  
<EOS>
into
this
fence
or
fortress
,
with
infinite
labour
,
I
carry
all
my
rich
,
all
my
provision
,
ammunition
,
and
store
,
of
which
you
have
the
account
above
;
and
I
make
me
a
large
tent
,
which
,
to
preserve
me
from
the
rain
,
that
in
one
part
of
the
year
be
very
violent
there
,
I
make
double
,
viz
.
<EOS>
one
small
tent
within
,
and
one
large
tent
above
it
,
and
cover
the
uppermost
with
a
large
tarpaulin
which
I
have
save
among
the
sail
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
lay
no
more
for
awhile
in
the
bed
which
I
have
bring
on
shore
,
but
in
a
hammock
,
which
be
indeed
a
very
good
one
,
and
belong
to
the
mate
of
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
into
this
tent
I
bring
all
my
provision
,
and
every
thing
that
would
spoil
by
the
wet
;
and
have
thus
enclose
all
my
good
,
I
make
up
the
entrance
,
which
till
now
I
have
leave
open
,
and
so
pass
and
repasse
,
as
I
say
,
by
a
short
ladder
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
this
,
I
begin
to
work
my
way
into
the
rock
,
and
bring
all
the
earth
and
stone
that
I
dig
down
,
out
through
my
tent
<EOS>
,
I
lay
them
up
within
my
fence
in
the
nature
of
a
terrace
,
that
so
it
raise
the
ground
within
about
a
foot
and
a
half
;
and
thus
I
make
me
a
cave
just
behind
my
tent
,
which
serve
me
like
a
cellar
to
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
cost
me
much
labour
,
and
many
day
,
before
all
these
thing
be
bring
to
perfection
,
and
therefore
I
must
go
back
to
some
other
thing
which
take
up
some
of
my
thought
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
it
happen
,
after
I
have
lay
my
scheme
for
the
setting
up
my
tent
,
and
make
the
cave
,
that
a
storm
of
rain
fall
from
a
thick
dark
cloud
,
a
sudden
flash
of
lightning
happen
,
and
after
that
a
great
clap
of
thunder
,
as
be
naturally
the
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
much
surprised
with
the
lightning
,
as
I
be
with
a
thought
which
dart
into
my
mind
as
swift
as
the
lightning
itself
;
o
my
powder
!
<EOS>
my
very
heart
sink
within
me
,
when
I
think
,
that
at
one
blast
all
my
powder
may
be
destroy
;
on
which
,
not
my
defence
only
,
but
the
provide
me
food
,
as
I
think
,
entirely
depend
;
I
be
nothing
near
so
anxious
about
my
own
danger
<EOS>
;
though
,
have
the
powder
take
fire
,
I
have
never
know
who
have
hurt
me
.
  
<EOS>
such
impression
do
this
make
upon
me
,
that
,
after
the
storm
be
over
,
I
lay
aside
all
my
work
,
my
building
,
and
fortifying
,
and
apply
myself
to
make
bag
and
box
to
separate
the
powder
,
and
to
keep
it
a
little
and
a
little
in
a
parcel
,
in
hope
,
that
,
whatever
may
come
,
it
may
not
all
take
fire
at
once
,
and
to
keep
it
so
apart
,
that
it
should
not
be
possible
to
make
one
part
fire
another
.
<EOS>
I
finish
this
work
in
about
a
fortnight
;
and
I
think
my
powder
,
which
in
all
be
about
two
hundred
and
forty
pound
weight
,
be
divide
in
not
less
than
a
hundred
parcel
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
barrel
that
have
be
wet
,
I
do
not
apprehend
any
danger
from
that
,
so
I
place
it
in
my
new
cave
,
which
in
my
fancy
I
call
my
kitchen
;
and
the
rest
I
hide
up
and
down
in
hole
among
the
rock
,
so
that
no
wet
may
come
to
it
,
mark
very
carefully
where
I
lay
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
time
while
this
be
do
,
I
go
out
once
at
least
every
day
with
my
gun
,
as
well
to
divert
myself
,
as
to
see
if
I
could
kill
any
thing
fit
for
food
,
and
as
near
as
I
could
to
acquaint
myself
with
what
the
island
produce
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
I
go
out
I
presently
discover
that
there
be
goat
in
the
island
,
which
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
;
but
then
it
be
attend
with
this
misfortune
to
me
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
so
shy
,
so
subtle
,
and
so
swift
of
foot
,
that
it
be
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
come
at
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
discourage
at
this
,
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
may
now
and
then
shoot
one
,
as
it
soon
happen
;
for
after
I
have
find
their
haunt
a
little
,
I
lay
wait
in
this
manner
for
them
:
<EOS>
I
observe
,
if
they
see
me
in
the
vallies
,
though
they
be
upon
the
rock
,
they
would
run
away
as
in
a
terrible
fright
;
but
if
they
be
feed
in
the
vallies
,
and
I
be
upon
the
rock
<EOS>
,
they
take
no
notice
of
me
;
from
whence
I
conclude
,
that
by
the
position
of
their
optic
,
their
sight
be
so
direct
downward
,
that
they
do
not
readily
see
object
that
be
above
them
;
so
afterward
<EOS>
I
take
this
method
;
I
always
climb
the
rock
first
,
to
get
above
them
,
and
then
have
frequently
a
fair
mark
.
<EOS>
the
first
shot
I
make
among
these
creature
kill
a
she
-
goat
,
which
have
a
little
kid
by
her
which
she
give
suck
to
,
which
grieve
me
heartily
;
but
when
the
old
one
fall
,
the
kid
stand
stock
still
by
her
till
I
come
and
take
her
up
;
and
not
only
so
<EOS>
;
but
when
I
carry
the
old
one
with
me
upon
my
shoulder
,
the
kid
follow
me
quite
to
my
enclosure
;
upon
which
I
lay
down
the
dam
,
and
take
the
kid
in
my
arm
,
and
carry
it
over
my
pale
,
in
hope
to
have
breed
it
up
tame
;
but
it
would
not
eat
;
so
I
be
force
to
kill
it
,
and
eat
it
myself
.
<EOS>
these
two
supply
me
with
flesh
a
great
while
,
for
I
eat
sparingly
,
and
save
my
provision
(
my
bread
especially
)
as
much
as
possibly
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
fix
my
habitation
,
I
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
provide
a
place
to
make
a
fire
in
,
and
fuel
to
burn
;
and
what
I
do
for
that
,
as
also
how
I
enlarge
my
cave
,
and
<EOS>
what
conveniencie
I
make
,
I
shall
give
a
full
account
of
in
its
place
;
but
I
must
first
give
some
little
account
of
myself
,
and
of
my
thought
about
living
,
which
it
may
well
be
suppose
be
not
a
few
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
dismal
prospect
of
my
condition
;
for
as
I
be
not
cast
away
upon
that
island
without
be
drive
,
as
be
say
,
by
a
violent
storm
quite
out
of
the
course
of
our
intended
voyage
,
and
a
great
way
,
viz
.
<EOS>
some
hundred
of
league
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
the
trade
of
mankind
,
I
have
great
reason
to
consider
it
as
a
determination
of
Heaven
,
that
in
this
desolate
place
,
and
in
this
desolate
manner
,
I
should
end
my
life
.
<EOS>
the
tear
would
run
plentifully
down
my
face
when
I
make
these
reflection
;
and
sometimes
I
would
expostulate
with
myself
,
why
Providence
should
thus
completely
ruin
his
creature
,
and
render
them
so
absolutely
miserable
,
so
without
help
abandon
,
so
entirely
depressed
,
that
it
could
hardly
be
rational
to
be
thankful
for
such
a
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
something
always
return
swift
upon
me
to
check
these
thought
,
and
to
reprove
me
;
and
particularly
one
day
,
walk
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
by
the
sea
-
side
<EOS>
,
I
be
very
pensive
upon
the
subject
of
my
present
condition
,
when
reason
,
as
it
be
,
expostulate
with
the
t'other
way
,
thus
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
you
be
in
a
desolate
condition
,
'
tis
true
,
but
pray
remember
,
where
be
the
rest
of
you
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
come
eleven
of
you
into
the
boat
?
<EOS>
where
be
the
ten
?
<EOS>
why
be
they
not
save
and
you
lose
?
<EOS>
why
be
you
single
out
?
<EOS>
be
it
well
to
be
here
or
there
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
point
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
all
evil
be
to
be
consider
with
the
good
that
be
in
them
,
and
with
what
bad
attend
them
.
  
<EOS>
then
it
occur
to
me
again
,
how
well
I
be
furnish
for
my
subsistence
,
and
what
would
have
be
my
ease
if
it
have
not
happen
,
which
be
an
hundred
thousand
to
one
,
that
the
ship
float
from
the
place
where
she
first
strike
,
and
be
drive
so
near
the
shore
that
I
have
time
to
get
all
these
thing
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
what
would
have
be
my
case
,
if
I
have
be
to
have
live
in
the
condition
in
which
I
at
first
come
on
shore
,
without
necessary
of
life
,
or
necessary
to
supply
and
procure
them
?
"
<EOS>
particularly
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
loud
(
though
to
myself
)
,
"
what
should
I
have
do
without
a
gun
,
without
ammunition
,
without
any
tool
to
make
any
thing
,
or
to
work
with
;
without
clothe
,
bed
,
a
tent
,
or
any
manner
of
covering
?
"
<EOS>
and
that
now
I
have
all
these
to
a
sufficient
quantity
,
and
be
in
a
fair
way
to
provide
myself
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
live
without
my
gun
when
my
ammunition
be
spend
;
so
that
I
have
a
tolerable
view
of
subsist
,
without
any
want
,
as
long
as
I
live
;
for
I
consider
from
the
beginning
how
I
should
provide
for
the
accident
that
may
happen
,
and
for
the
time
that
be
to
come
,
even
not
only
after
my
ammunition
should
be
spend
,
but
even
after
my
health
or
strength
should
decay
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
not
entertain
any
notion
of
my
ammunition
be
destroy
at
one
blast
,
I
mean
my
powder
be
blow
up
by
lightning
;
and
this
make
the
thought
of
it
so
surprising
to
me
when
it
lightne
and
thunder
,
as
I
observe
just
now
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
be
about
to
enter
into
a
melancholy
relation
of
a
scene
of
silent
life
,
such
perhaps
as
be
never
hear
of
in
the
world
before
,
I
shall
take
it
from
its
beginning
,
and
continue
it
in
its
order
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
by
my
account
,
the
30th
of
September
,
when
,
in
the
manner
as
above
say
,
I
first
set
foot
upon
this
horrid
island
,
when
the
sun
be
,
to
us
,
in
its
autumnal
equinox
,
be
almost
just
over
my
head
,
for
I
reckon
myself
,
by
observation
,
to
be
in
the
latitude
of
9
degree
22
minute
north
of
the
line
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
be
there
about
ten
or
twelve
day
,
it
come
into
my
thought
,
that
I
should
lose
my
reckoning
of
time
for
want
of
book
,
and
pen
and
ink
,
and
should
even
forget
the
sabbath
day
from
the
work
day
;
but
to
prevent
this
,
I
cut
it
with
my
knife
upon
a
large
post
,
in
capital
letter
,
and
make
it
into
a
great
cross
,
I
set
it
up
on
the
shore
where
I
first
land
,
viz
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
on
shore
here
on
the
30th
of
September
1659
.
<EOS>
"
upon
the
side
of
this
square
post
,
I
cut
every
day
a
notch
with
my
knife
,
and
every
seventh
notch
be
as
long
again
as
the
rest
,
and
every
first
day
of
the
month
as
long
again
as
that
long
one
;
and
thus
I
keep
my
calendar
,
or
weekly
,
monthly
,
and
yearly
reckoning
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
we
be
to
observe
,
that
among
the
many
thing
which
I
bring
out
of
the
ship
in
the
several
voyage
,
which
,
as
above
mention
,
I
make
to
it
,
I
get
several
thing
of
less
value
,
but
not
all
less
useful
to
me
,
which
I
omit
set
down
before
;
as
in
particular
,
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
several
parcel
in
the
captain
's
,
mate
's
,
gunner
's
,
and
carpenter
's
keeping
,
three
or
four
compass
,
some
mathematical
instrument
,
dial
,
perspective
,
chart
,
and
book
of
navigation
;
all
which
I
huddle
together
,
whether
I
may
want
them
or
no
.
<EOS>
also
I
find
three
very
good
bible
,
which
come
to
me
in
my
cargo
from
England
,
and
which
I
have
pack
up
among
my
thing
;
some
portuguese
book
also
,
and
among
them
two
or
three
popish
prayer
-
book
,
and
several
other
book
;
all
which
I
carefully
secure
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
not
forget
,
that
we
have
in
the
ship
a
dog
and
two
cat
,
of
whose
eminent
history
I
may
have
occasion
to
say
something
in
<EOS>
it
's
place
;
for
I
carry
both
the
cat
with
me
;
and
as
for
the
dog
,
he
jump
out
of
the
ship
of
himself
,
and
swam
on
shore
to
me
the
day
after
I
go
on
shore
with
my
first
cargo
,
and
be
a
trusty
servant
to
me
many
year
;
I
want
nothing
that
he
could
fetch
me
,
nor
any
company
that
he
could
make
up
to
me
;
I
only
want
to
have
him
talk
to
me
,
but
that
he
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
as
I
observe
before
,
I
find
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
I
husband
them
to
the
utmost
;
and
I
shall
shew
,
that
while
my
ink
last
,
I
keep
thing
very
exact
;
but
after
that
be
go
I
could
not
,
for
I
could
not
make
any
ink
by
any
mean
that
I
could
devise
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
put
me
in
mind
that
I
want
many
thing
,
notwithstanding
all
that
I
have
amass
together
;
and
of
these
,
this
of
ink
be
one
,
as
also
spade
,
pickaxe
,
and
shovel
,
to
dig
or
remove
the
earth
;
needle
,
pin
,
and
thread
.
<EOS>
as
for
linen
,
I
soon
learn
to
want
that
without
much
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
this
want
of
tool
make
every
work
I
do
go
on
heavily
,
and
it
be
near
a
whole
year
before
I
have
entirely
finish
my
little
pale
or
surrounded
habitation
:
<EOS>
the
pile
or
stake
,
which
be
as
heavy
as
I
could
well
lift
,
be
a
long
time
in
cutting
and
prepare
in
the
wood
,
and
more
by
far
in
bring
home
;
so
that
I
spend
sometimes
two
day
in
cut
and
bring
home
one
of
those
post
,
and
a
third
day
in
drive
it
into
the
ground
;
for
which
purpose
I
get
a
heavy
piece
of
wood
at
first
,
but
at
last
bethought
myself
of
one
of
the
iron
crow
,
<EOS>
which
however
,
though
I
find
it
,
yet
it
make
drive
those
post
or
pile
very
laborious
and
tedious
work
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
need
I
have
be
concern
at
the
tediousness
of
any
thing
I
have
to
do
,
see
I
have
time
enough
to
do
it
in
?
<EOS>
nor
have
I
any
other
employment
if
that
have
be
over
,
at
least
that
I
could
foresee
,
except
the
range
the
island
to
seek
for
food
,
which
I
do
more
or
less
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
consider
seriously
my
condition
,
and
the
circumstance
I
be
reduce
to
,
and
I
draw
up
the
state
of
my
affair
in
writing
,
not
so
much
to
leave
them
to
any
that
be
to
come
after
me
,
<EOS>
for
I
be
like
to
have
<EOS>
but
few
heir
,
as
to
deliver
my
thought
from
daily
pore
upon
them
,
and
afflict
my
mind
;
and
as
my
reason
begin
now
to
master
my
despondency
,
I
begin
to
comfort
myself
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
to
set
the
good
against
the
evil
,
that
I
may
have
something
to
distinguish
my
case
from
bad
;
and
I
state
it
very
impartially
,
like
debtor
and
creditor
,
the
comfort
I
enjoy
against
the
misery
I
suffer
,
thus
:
  
evil
.
                     
<EOS>
Good
.
       
<EOS>
I
be
cast
upon
a
horrible
   
<EOS>
but
I
be
alive
,
and
     
desolate

<EOS>
,
void
       
not

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
but
I
be

and
He

miraculously
save
me
from
                                  
death

can
deliver
me
                                  
from
this

<EOS>
I
be

from

but
I
be
not

place
,
afford
no
sustenance
.
       
<EOS>
I
have
not
clothe
to
       
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
a
hot
climate
,
     
cover
me
.
                   
<EOS>
where
if
I
have
                                  
clothe
I
could
hardly
wear
                                  
them
.
       
<EOS>
I
be
without
any
defence
    
<EOS>
but
I
be
cast
on
an
     
or
mean
to
resist
          
island
,
where
I
see
no
     
<EOS>
any
violence
of
man
or
      
wild
beast
to
hurt
me
,
     
beast
.
                      
<EOS>
as
I
see
on
the
coast
of
                                  
Africa
:
<EOS>
and
what
if
I
                                  
have
be
shipwreck
                                  
there
?
       
<EOS>
I
have
no
soul
to
speak
     
<EOS>
but
God
wonderfully
     
to
,
or
relieve
me
.
          
<EOS>
send
the
ship
in
near
                                  
enough
to
the
shore
,
that
                                  
I
have
get
out
so
many
                                  
necessary
thing
as
will
                                  
either
supply
my
want
,
                                  
or
enable
me
to
supply
                                  
myself
even
as
long
as
I
                                  
live
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
here
be
an
undoubted
testimony
,
that
there
be
scarce
any
condition
in
the
world
so
miserable
,
but
there
be
something
negative
or
something
positive
to
be
thankful
for
in
it
;
and
let
this
stand
as
a
direction
from
the
experience
of
the
most
miserable
of
all
condition
in
this
world
,
that
we
may
always
find
in
it
something
to
comfort
ourselves
from
,
and
to
set
,
in
the
description
of
good
and
evil
,
on
the
credit
side
of
the
account
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
bring
my
mind
a
little
to
relish
my
condition
,
and
give
over
look
out
to
sea
,
to
see
if
I
could
spy
a
ship
;
I
say
,
give
over
these
thing
,
I
begin
to
apply
myself
to
accommodate
my
way
of
living
,
and
to
make
thing
as
easy
to
me
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
describe
my
habitation
,
which
be
a
tent
under
the
side
of
a
rock
,
surround
with
a
strong
pale
of
post
and
cable
;
but
I
may
now
rather
call
it
a
wall
,
for
I
raise
a
kind
of
wall
up
against
it
of
turf
,
about
two
foot
thick
on
the
outside
;
and
after
some
time
,
I
think
it
be
a
year
and
half
<EOS>
,
I
raise
rafter
from
it
,
lean
to
the
rock
,
and
thatch
or
cover
it
with
bough
of
tree
,
and
such
thing
as
I
could
get
to
keep
out
the
rain
,
which
I
find
at
some
time
of
the
year
very
violent
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
how
I
bring
all
my
good
into
this
pale
,
and
into
the
cave
which
I
have
make
behind
me
:
but
I
must
observe
too
that
at
first
this
be
a
confused
heap
of
good
,
which
as
they
lie
in
no
order
,
so
they
take
up
all
my
place
:
<EOS>
I
have
no
room
to
turn
myself
;
so
I
set
myself
to
enlarge
my
cave
,
and
work
farther
into
the
earth
;
for
it
be
a
loose
sandy
rock
,
which
yield
easily
to
the
labour
I
bestow
on
it
:
<EOS>
and
so
when
I
find
I
be
pretty
safe
as
to
beast
of
prey
<EOS>
,
I
work
sideways
to
the
right
hand
into
the
rock
;
and
then
,
turn
to
the
right
again
,
work
quite
out
,
and
make
me
a
door
to
come
out
,
on
the
outside
of
my
pale
or
fortification
.
  
<EOS>
this
give
me
not
only
egress
and
regress
,
as
it
be
a
back
-
way
to
my
tent
and
to
my
storehouse
,
but
give
me
room
to
stow
my
good
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
begin
to
apply
myself
to
make
such
necessary
thing
as
I
find
I
most
want
,
particularly
a
chair
and
a
table
;
for
without
these
I
be
not
able
to
enjoy
the
few
comfort
I
have
in
the
world
;
I
could
not
write
or
eat
,
or
do
several
thing
with
so
much
pleasure
without
a
table
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
work
;
and
here
I
must
need
observe
,
that
as
reason
be
the
substance
and
original
of
the
mathematic
,
so
by
state
and
square
every
thing
by
reason
,
and
by
make
the
most
rational
judgment
of
thing
,
every
man
may
be
in
time
master
of
every
mechanic
art
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
handle
a
tool
in
my
life
,
and
yet
in
time
,
by
labour
,
application
,
and
contrivance
,
I
find
at
last
that
I
want
nothing
<EOS>
but
I
could
have
make
it
,
especially
if
I
have
have
tool
;
however
,
I
make
abundance
of
thing
,
even
without
tool
,
and
some
with
no
more
tool
than
an
adze
and
a
hatchet
,
which
perhaps
be
never
make
that
way
before
,
and
that
with
infinite
labour
:
for
example
,
if
I
want
a
board
,
I
have
no
other
way
but
to
cut
down
a
tree
,
set
it
on
an
edge
before
me
,
and
hew
it
flat
on
either
side
with
my
axe
,
till
I
have
bring
it
to
be
as
thin
as
a
plank
,
and
then
dub
it
smooth
with
my
adze
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
by
this
method
I
could
make
but
one
board
out
of
a
whole
tree
;
but
this
I
have
no
remedy
for
<EOS>
but
patience
,
any
more
than
I
have
for
the
prodigious
deal
of
time
and
labour
which
it
take
me
up
to
make
a
plank
or
board
:
but
<EOS>
my
time
or
labour
be
little
worth
,
and
so
it
be
as
well
employ
one
way
as
another
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
make
me
a
table
and
a
chair
,
as
I
observe
above
,
in
the
first
place
;
and
this
I
do
out
of
the
short
piece
of
board
that
I
bring
on
my
raft
from
the
ship
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
work
out
some
board
,
as
above
,
I
make
large
shelf
of
the
breadth
of
a
foot
and
a
half
one
over
another
,
all
along
one
side
of
my
cave
,
to
lay
all
my
tool
,
nail
,
and
iron
-
work
,
and
in
a
word
,
to
separate
every
thing
at
large
in
their
place
,
that
I
may
come
easily
at
them
.
<EOS>
I
knock
piece
into
the
wall
of
the
rock
to
hang
my
gun
and
all
thing
that
would
hang
up
.
  
<EOS>
so
that
,
have
my
cave
be
to
be
see
,
it
look
like
a
general
magazine
of
all
necessary
thing
;
and
I
have
every
thing
so
ready
at
my
hand
,
that
it
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
all
my
good
in
such
order
,
and
especially
to
find
my
stock
of
all
necessary
so
great
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
that
I
begin
to
keep
a
journal
of
every
day
's
employment
;
for
indeed
at
first
I
be
in
too
much
a
hurry
;
and
not
only
hurry
as
to
labour
,
but
in
too
much
discomposure
of
mind
,
and
my
journal
would
have
be
full
of
many
dull
thing
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
I
must
have
say
thus
:
September
the
30th
,
after
I
get
to
shore
,
and
have
escape
drown
,
instead
of
be
thankful
to
God
for
my
deliverance
,
have
first
vomit
with
the
great
quantity
of
salt
water
which
be
get
into
my
stomach
,
and
recover
myself
a
little
,
I
run
about
the
shore
,
wring
my
hand
,
and
beat
my
head
and
face
,
exclaim
at
my
misery
,
and
cry
out
,
I
be
undone
,
undone
;
till
tired
and
faint
I
be
force
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
to
repose
,
but
durst
not
sleep
for
fear
of
be
devour
.
  
<EOS>
some
day
after
this
,
and
after
I
have
be
on
board
the
ship
,
and
get
all
that
I
could
out
of
her
,
yet
I
could
not
forbear
get
up
to
the
top
of
a
little
mountain
,
and
look
out
to
sea
in
hope
of
see
a
ship
;
then
fancy
at
a
vast
distance
I
spy
a
sail
;
please
myself
with
the
hope
of
it
;
and
then
after
look
steadily
till
I
be
almost
blind
,
lose
it
quite
,
and
sit
down
and
weep
like
a
child
,
and
thus
increase
my
misery
by
my
folly
.
  
<EOS>
but
have
get
over
these
thing
in
some
measure
,
and
have
settle
my
household
-
stuff
and
habitation
,
make
me
a
table
and
a
chair
,
and
all
as
handsome
about
me
as
I
could
,
I
begin
to
keep
my
journal
,
<EOS>
of
which
I
shall
here
give
you
the
copy
(
though
in

I
poor
miserable
Robinson
Crusoe
,
be
shipwreck
,
during
a
dreadful
storm
in
the
offing
,
come
on
shore
on
this
dismal
unfortunate
island
,
which
I
call
the
Island
of
Despair
;
all
the
rest
of
the
ship
's
company
be
drown
,
and
myself
almost
dead
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
rest
of
that
day
<EOS>
I
spend
in
afflict
myself
at
the
dismal
circumstance
I
be
bring
to
,
viz
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
food
,
house
,
clothe
,
weapon
,
or
place
to
fly
to
,
and
in
despair
of
any
relief
,
see
nothing
but
death
before
me
,
either
that
I
should
be
devour
by
wild
beast
,
murder
by
savage
,
or
starve
to
death
for
want
of
food
.
<EOS>
at
the
approach
of
night
I
sleep
in
a
tree
,
for
fear
of
wild
creature
,
but
sleep
soundly
,
though
it
rain
all
night
.

October
1
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
see
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
the
ship
have
float
with
the
high
tide
,
and
be
drive
on
shore
again
much
near
<EOS>
the
island
;
which
as
it
be
some
comfort
on
one
hand
,
for
see
her
sit
upright
,
and
not
break
to
piece
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
if
the
wind
abate
,
I
may
get
on
board
,
and
get
some
food
and
necessary
out
of
her
for
my
relief
;
so
on
the
other
hand
,
it
renew
my
grief
at
the
loss
of
my
comrade
,
who
I
imagine
,
if
we
have
all
staid
on
board
,
may
have
save
the
ship
,
or
at
least
that
they
would
not
have
be
all
drown
,
as
they
be
;
and
that
,
have
the
man
be
save
,
we
may
perhaps
have
build
us
a
boat
out
of
the
ruin
of
the
ship
,
to
have
carry
us
to
some
other
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
spend
great
part
of
this
day
in
perplex
myself
on
these
thing
;
but
at
length
,
see
the
ship
almost
dry
<EOS>
,
I
go
upon
the
sand
as
near
as
I
could
,
and
then
swam
on
board
.
<EOS>
this
day
also
it
continue
rain
,
though
with
no
wind
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
1st
of
October
to
the
24th
.
<EOS>
all
these
day
entirely
spend
in
many
several
voyage
to
get
all
I
could
out
of
the
ship
,
which
I
bring
on
shore
,
every
tide
of
flood
,
upon
raft
.
<EOS>
much
rain
also
in
these
day
,
though
with
some
interval
of
fair
weather
:
but
,
it
seem
,
this
be
the
rainy
season
.

<EOS>
I
overset
my
raft
,
and
all
the
good
I
have
get
up
upon
it
;
but
be
in
shoal
water
,
and
the
thing
be
chiefly
heavy
<EOS>
,
I
recover
many
of
them
when
the

be
out

<EOS>
It
rain
all
night
and
all

with
some
gust
of
wind
;
during
which
time
the
ship
break
in
piece
,
the
wind
blow
a
little
harder
than
before
,
and
be
no
more
to
be
see
,
except
the
wreck
of
her
,
and
that
only
at
low
water
.
<EOS>
I
spend
this
day
in
covering
and
secure
the
good
which
I
have
save
,
that
rain
may
not
spoil
them
.
  
<EOS>
October

.
<EOS>
I
walk
about
the
shore
almost
all
day
,
to
find
out
a
place
to
fix
my
habitation
,
greatly
concerned
to
secure
myself
from
any
attack
in
the
night
,
either
from
wild
beast
or
man
.
<EOS>
towards
night
I
fix
upon
a
proper
place
under
a
rock
,
and
mark
out
a
semicircle
for
my
encampment
,
which
I
resolve
to
strengthen
with
a
work
,
wall
,
or
fortification
make
of
double
pile
,
line
within
with
cable
,
and
without
with

<EOS>
from
the

in
carry
all
my
good

,
though
some
part
of
the
time

rain
exceed
hard

<EOS>
the

I
go
out
into
the
island
with
my
gun

to
see
for
some

,
and
discover
the
country
;
when
I
kill
a
she
goat

which
I
afterwards
kill
also
,
because
it
would

kill
a

almost
fright
with

with
much

bring
it
to
a

even
in

terrible
thunder

which
fright
me
dreadfully
for
fear
of

as
soon

I
resolve
to
separate
my

these

which
may
hold
a
pound
,
or
two
pound
,
at
most
,
of

so
put
the
powder
in

I
stow
it
in
place
as
secure
and
remote
from
one
another
as
possible
.
<EOS>
on
one
of
these
three
day
I
kill

that
be
good
to
eat
,
but
I
know
not
what
to
call
it

<EOS>
November

.
<EOS>
this
day
I
begin
to
dig
behind
my
tent
into
the
rock
,
to
make
room
for
my
farth
conveniency
.
<EOS>
note
,
<EOS>
three
thing
I
want
exceedingly
for
this
work
,
viz
.
<EOS>
a
pickaxe
,
a
shovel
,
and
a
wheel
-
barrow
or
basket
<EOS>
;
so
I
desist
from
my
work
,
and
begin
to
consider
how
to
supply
that
want
,
and
make
me
some
tool
:
as
for
a
pickaxe
,
I
make
use
of
the
iron
crow
,
which
be
proper
enough
,
though
heavy
;
but
the
next
thing
be
a
shovel
or
spade
;
this
be
so
absolutely
necessary
,
that
indeed
I
could
do
nothing
effectually
without
it
;
but
what
kind
of
one
to
make
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
November
18
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
in
search
the
wood
I
find
a
tree
of
that
wood
,
or
like
it
,
which
in
the
brasil
they
call
the
iron
tree
,
for
its
exceed
hardness
:
of
this
,
with
great
labour
and
almost
spoil
my
axe
,
I
cut
a
piece
,
and
bring
it
home
too
with
difficulty
enough
,
for
it
be
exceed
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
the
excessive
hardness
of
the
wood
,
and
have
no
other
way
,
make
me
a
long
while
upon
this
machine
;
for
I
work
it
effectually
by
little
and
little
into
the
form
of
a
shovel
or
spade
,
the
handle
exactly
shape
like
our
in
England
,
only
that
the
broad
part
have
no
iron
shod
upon
it
at
bottom
,
it
would
not
last
me
so
long
;
however
,
it
serve
well
enough
for
the
use
which
I
have
occasion
to
put
it
to
;
but
never
be
a
shovel
,
I
believe
,
make
after
that
fashion
,
or
so
long
a
making
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
still
deficient
,
for
I
want
a
basket
or
a
wheel
-
barrow
;
a
basket
I
could
not
make
by
any
mean
,
have
no
such
thing
as
twig
that
would
bend
to
make
wicker
-
ware
,
at
least
none
yet
find
out
;
and
as
to
a
wheel
-
barrow
,
I
fancy
I
could
make
;
all
but
the
wheel
,
but
that
I
have
no
notion
of
,
neither
do
I
know
how
to
go
about
it
;
besides
,
I
have
no
possible
way
to
make
the
iron
gudgeon
for
the
spindle
or
axis
of
the
wheel
to
run
in
,
so
I
give
it
over
;
and
so
for
carry
away
the
earth
which
I
dig
out
of
the
cave
,
I
make
me
a
thing
like
a
hod
which
the
labourer
carry
mortar
in
,
when
they
serve
the
bricklayer
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
so
difficult
to
me
as
the
make
the
shovel
;
and
yet
this
,
and
the
shovel
,
and
the
attempt
which
I
make
in
vain
to
make
a
wheel
-
barrow
,
take
me
up
no
less
than
four
day
,
I
mean
always
except
my
morning
walk
with
my
gun
,
which
I
seldom
fail
;
and
very
seldom
fail
also
bring
home
something
to
eat
.

My
other
work
have
now
stand
still
,
because
of
my
make
these
tool
,
when
they
be
finish
I
go
on
,
and
work
every
day
,
<EOS>
as
my
strength
and
time
allow
,
I
spend
eighteen
day
entirely
in
widen
and
deepen
my
cave
,
that
it
may
hold
my
good
commodiously
.
  
<EOS>
note
,
during
all
this
time
,
I
work
to
make
this
room
or
cave
spacious
enough
to
accommodate
me
as
a
warehouse
or
magazine
,
a
kitchen
,
a
dining
-
room
,
and
a
cellar
:
<EOS>
as
for
my
lodging
,
I
keep
to
the
tent
,
except
that
sometimes
in
the
wet
season
of
the
year
,
it
rain
so
hard
that
I
could
not
keep
myself
dry
,
which
cause
me
afterwards
to
cover
all
my
place
within
my
pale
with
long
pole
in
the
form
of
rafter
,
lean
against
the
rock
,
and
load
them
with
flag
and
large
leave
of
tree
like
a

I
begin
now
to
think
my
cave
or
vault
finish

when
on
a
sudden
(
it
seem
I
have
make
it
too
large
)
a
great
quantity
of
earth
fall
down
from
the
top
and
one
side
,
so
much
that
in
short
it
fright
me
,
and
not
without
reason
too
;
for
if
I
have
be
under
it
I
have
never
want
a
gravedigger
.
<EOS>
upon
this
disaster
I
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
over
again
;
for
I
have
the
loose
earth
to
carry
out
,
and
,
which
be
of
more
importance
,
I
have
the
ceiling
to
prop
up
,
so
that
I
may
be
sure
no
more
would
come
down
.

with
two

of

this
I
finish
the

day
;

set
more
post
up
with
board
,
in
about
a
week
more
I
have
the

when
I

it
home
,
I
bind
and
splinter
up
its
leg
which
be
break

<EOS>
N.B.
I
take
such
care
of
it
that
it

and
the

grow
well

as
strong
as
ever
;
but
by

it
so
long
it
grow
tame

and
feed
upon
the
little
green
at
my
door

and
would
not
go
away

<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
that
I
entertain
a
thought
of
breed
up
some
tame
creature

food
when

and
shot
be

very

go

early

with

lie
still
in

<EOS>
this

go
farther
into
the

which
lie
towards

I
find
there
be
plenty
of

exceed
shy
and
hard
to
come
at

I
resolve
to
try
if

down

accordingly
,
the

I
go
out
with
my

and
set
him
upon
the
goat
;
but
I
be
mistaken
,
for
they
all
face
about
upon
the
dog
;
and
he
know
his
danger
too
well
,
for
he
would
,
not
come
near

<EOS>
January

<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
begin
my
fence
or
wall
;
which
,
be
still
jealous
of
my
being
attack
by
somebody
,
I
resolve
to
make
very
thick
and
strong
.
       
<EOS>
N.B.
<EOS>
this
wall
be
describe
before
,
I
purposely
omit
what
     
be
say
,
in
the
Journal
;
it
be
sufficient
to
observe
,
that
I
     
be
no
less
time
than
from
the
3d
of
January
to
the
14th
of
     
April
,
work
,
finish
,
and
perfect
this
wall
,
though
     
it
be
no
more
than
about
twenty
-
four
yard
in
length
,
be
     
a
half
-
circle
from
one
place
in
the
rock
to
another
place
     
<EOS>
about
eight
yard
from
it
,
the
door
of
the
cave
be
in
the
     
centre
behind
it
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
work
very
hard
,
the
rain
hinder
me
many
day
,
nay
,
sometimes
week
together
;
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
should
never
be
perfectly
secure
until
this
wall
be
finish
;
and
it
be
scarce
credible
what
inexpressible
labour
every
thing
be
do
with
,
especially
the
bring
pile
out
of
the
wood
,
and
drive
them
into
the
ground
,
for
I
make
them
much
big
than
I
need
to
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
wall
be
finish
,
and
the
outside
double
fence
with
a
turf
wall
raise
up
close
to
it
,
I
persuade
myself
that
if
any
people
be
to
come
on
shore
there
,
they
would
not
perceive
any
thing
like
a
habitation
;
and
it
be
very
well
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
as
may
be
observe
hereafter
upon
a
very
remarkable
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
time
I
make
my
round
in
the
wood
for
game
every
day
,
when
the
rain
admit
me
,
and
make
frequent
discovery
in
these
walk
of
something
or
other
to
my
advantage
;
particularly
I
find
a
kind
of
wild
pigeon
,
who
build
not
as
wood
pigeon
in
a
tree
,
but
rather
as
house
pigeon
,
in
the
hole
of
the
rock
;
and
take
some
young
one
,
I
endeavour
to
breed
them
up
tame
,
and
do
so
;
but
when
they
grow
old
they
fly
away
,
which
perhaps
be
at
first
for
want
of
feed
them
,
for
I
have
nothing
to
give
them
;
however
,
I
frequently
find
their
nest
,
and
get
their
young
one
,
which
be
very
good
meat
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
in
the
manage
my
household
affair
,
I
find
myself
want
in
many
thing
,
which
I
think
at
first
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
make
,
as
indeed
as
to
some
of
them
it
be
;
for
instance
,
I
could
never
make
a
cask
to
be
hoop
;
I
have
a
small
runlet
or
two
,
as
I
observe
before
,
but
I
could
never
arrive
to
the
capacity
of
make
one
by
them
,
though
I
spend
many
week
about
it
<EOS>
;
I
could
neither
put
in
the
head
,
or
joint
the
stave
so
true
to
one
another
as
to
make
them
hold
water
:
so
I
give
that
also
over
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
I
be
at
a
great
loss
for
candle
;
so
that
as
soon
as
ever
it
be
dark
,
which
be
generally
by
seven
o'clock
,
I
be
oblige
to
go
to
bed
<EOS>
:
I
remember
the
lump
of
bee
-
wax
with
which
I
make
candle
in
my
african
adventure
,
but
I
have
none
of
that
now
;
the
only
remedy
I
have
,
be
,
that
when
I
have
kill
a
goat
I
save
the
tallow
,
and
with
a
little
dish
make
of
clay
,
which
I
bake
in
the
sun
,
to
which
I
add
a
wick
of
some
oakum
,
I
make
me
a
lamp
;
and
this
give
me
light
,
though
not
a
clear
steady
light
like
a
candle
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
all
my
labour
it
happen
,
that
,
rummage
my
thing
,
I
find
a
little
bag
,
which
,
as
I
hint
before
,
have
be
fill
with
corn
for
the
feeding
of
poultry
;
not
for
this
voyage
,
but
before
,
as
I
suppose
,
when
the
ship
come
from
Lisbon
;
what
little
remainder
of
corn
have
be
in
the
bag
,
be
all
devour
with
the
rat
,
and
I
see
nothing
in
the
bag
but
husk
and
dust
;
and
be
willing
to
have
the
bag
for
some
other
use
,
I
think
it
be
to
put
powder
in
,
<EOS>
when
I
divide
it
for
fear
of
the
lightning
,
or
some
such
use
,
I
shake
the
husk
of
corn
out
of
it
on
one
side
of
my
fortification
under
the
rock
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
before
the
great
rain
,
just
now
mention
,
that
I
throw
this
stuff
away
,
take
no
notice
of
any
thing
,
and
not
so
much
as
remember
that
I
have
throw
any
thing
there
;
when
about
a
month
after
,
or
thereabout
,
I
see
some
few
stalk
of
something
green
shoot
out
of
the
ground
,
which
I
fancy
may
be
some
plant
I
have
not
see
;
but
I
be
surprised
and
perfectly
astonish
,
when
after
a
little
long
time
I
see
about
ten
or
twelve
ear
come
out
,
which
be
perfect
green
barley
of
the
same
kind
as
our
European
,
nay
,
as
our
english
barley
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
and
confusion
of
my
thought
on
this
occasion
;
I
have
hitherto
act
upon
no
religious
foundation
at
all
;
indeed
I
have
very
few
notion
of
religion
in
my
head
,
or
have
entertain
any
sense
of
any
thing
that
have
befall
me
,
otherwise
than
as
a
chance
,
or
,
as
we
lightly
say
,
what
please
God
;
without
so
much
as
inquire
into
the
end
of
Providence
in
these
thing
,
or
his
order
in
govern
event
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
after
I
see
barley
grow
there
,
in
a
climate
which
I
know
be
not
proper
for
corn
,
and
especially
that
I
know
not
how
it
come
there
,
it
startle
me
strangely
,
and
I
begin
to
suggest
,
that
God
have
miraculously
cause
this
grain
to
grow
without
any
help
of
seed
sown
,
and
that
it
be
so
direct
purely
for
my
sustenance
on
that
wild
miserable
place
.
  
<EOS>
this
touch
my
heart
a
little
,
and
bring
tear
out
of
my
eye
,
and
I
begin
to
bless
myself
,
that
such
a
prodigy
of
nature
should
happen
upon
my
account
;
and
this
be
the
more
strange
to
me
,
because
I
see
near
it
still
,
all
along
by
the
side
of
the
rock
,
some
other
straggle
stalk
,
which
prove
to
be
stalk
of
rice
,
and
which
I
know
,
because
I
have
see
it
grow
in
Africa
,
when
I
be
ashore
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
not
only
think
these
the
pure
production
of
Providence
for
my
support
,
but
not
doubt
but
that
there
be
more
in
the
place
,
I
go
all
over
that
part
of
the
island
,
where
I
have
be
before
,
peep
in
every
corner
and
under
every
rock
to
see
for
more
of
it
,
but
I
could
not
find
any
;
at
last
it
occur
to
my
thought
,
that
I
have
shake
a
bag
of
chicken
's
meat
out
in
that
place
,
and
then
the
wonder
begin
to
cease
;
and
I
must
confess
,
my
religious
thankfulness
to
God
's
providence
begin
to
abate
too
upon
discover
that
all
this
be
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
be
common
;
though
I
ought
to
have
be
as
thankful
for
so
strange
and
unforeseen
a
providence
as
if
it
have
be
miraculous
;
for
it
be
really
the
work
of
Providence
as
to
me
,
that
should
order
or
appoint
ten
or
twelve
grain
of
corn
to
remain
unspoiled
,
when
the
rat
have
destroy
all
the
rest
,
as
if
it
have
be
drop
from
heaven
:
as
also
,
that
I
should
throw
it
out
in
that
particular
place
,
where
,
it
be
in
the
shade
of
a
high
rock
,
it
spring
up
immediately
;
whereas
if
I
have
throw
it
any
be
else
at
that
time
,
it
have
be
burn
up
and
destroy
.
  
<EOS>
I
carefully
save
the
ear
of
corn
,
you
may
be
sure
,
in
their
season
,
which
be
about
the
end
of
June
,
and
lay
up
every
corn
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
sow
them
all
again
,
hope
in
time
to
have
some
quantity
sufficient
to
supply
me
with
bread
;
but
it
be
not
till
the
fourth
year
that
I
could
allow
myself
the
least
grain
of
this
corn
to
eat
,
and
even
then
but
sparingly
,
as
I
shall
say
afterwards
in
its
order
;
for
I
lose
all
that
I
sow
the
first
season
,
by
not
observe
the
proper
time
;
for
I
sow
it
just
before
the
dry
season
,
so
that
it
never
come
up
at
all
,
at
least
not
as
it
would
have
do
:
of
which
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
barley
there
be
,
as
above
,
twenty
or
thirty
stalk
of
rice
,
which
I
preserve
with
the
same
care
,
and
whose
use
be
of
the
same
kind
or
to
the
same
purpose
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
make
me
bread
,
or
rather
food
;
for
I
find
way
to
cook
it
up
without
bake
,
though
I
do
that
also
after
some
time
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
I
work
excessive
hard
these
three
or
four
month
to
get
my
wall
do
;
and
the
14th
of
April
<EOS>
I
close
it
up
,
contrive
to
go
into
it
,
not
by
a
door
,
but
over
the
wall
by
a
ladder
,
that
there
may
be
no
sign
in
the
outside
of
my
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
April
16
.
<EOS>
I
finish
the
ladder
;
so
I
go
up
with
the
ladder
to
the
top
,
and
then
pull
it
up
after
me
,
and
let
it
down
on
the
inside
:
this
be
a
complete
enclosure
to
me
;
for
within
I
have
room
enough
,
and
nothing
could
come
at
me
from
without
,
unless
it
could
first
mount
my
wall
.
  
<EOS>
the
very
next
day
after
this
wall
be
finish
,
I
have
almost
have
all
my
labour
overthrow
at
once
,
and
myself
kill
;
the
case
be
thus
:
as
I
be
busy
in
the
inside
of
it
behind
my
tent
,
just
in
the
entrance
into
my
cave
,
I
be
terribly
fright
with
a
most
dreadful
surprising
thing
indeed
;
for
on
a
sudden
I
find
the
earth
come
crumble
down
from
the
roof
of
my
cave
,
and
from
the
edge
of
the
hill
,
over
my
head
,
and
<EOS>
two
of
the
post
I
have
set
up
in
the
cave
crack
in
a
frightful
manner
:
I
be
heartily
scare
,
but
think
nothing
of
what
be
really
the
cause
,
only
think
that
the
top
of
my
cave
be
fall
in
,
as
some
of
it
have
do
before
;
and
for
fear
I
should
be
bury
in
it
,
I
run
forward
to
my
ladder
,
and
not
think
myself
safe
there
neither
<EOS>
,
I
get
over
my
wall
for
fear
of
the
piece
of
the
hill
which
I
expect
may
roll
down
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
stept
down
upon
the
firm
ground
,
but
I
plainly
see
it
be
a
terrible
earthquake
,
for
the
ground
I
stand
on
<EOS>
shake
three
time
at
about
eight
minute
distance
,
with
three
such
shock
,
as
would
have
overturn
the
strong
building
that
could
be
suppose
to
have
stand
on
the
earth
;
and
a
great
piece
of
the
top
of
a
rock
,
which
stand
about
half
a
mile
from
me
next
the
sea
,
fall
down
with
such
a
terrible
noise
as
I
never
hear
in
all
my
life
:
<EOS>
I
perceive
also
<EOS>
the
very
sea
be
put
into
violent
motion
by
it
;
and
I
believe
the
shock
be
strong
under
the
water
than
on
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
amazed
with
the
thing
itself
,
have
never
feel
the
like
,
or
discourse
with
any
one
that
have
,
that
I
be
like
one
dead
or
stupifie
;
and
the
motion
of
the
earth
make
my
stomach
sick
,
like
one
that
be
toss
at
sea
;
but
the
noise
of
the
falling
of
the
rock
awake
me
,
as
it
be
,
and
rouse
me
from
the
stupifie
condition
I
be
in
,
fill
me
with
horror
,
and
I
think
of
nothing
then
<EOS>
but
the
hill
fall
upon
my
tent
and
all
my
household
good
,
and
bury
all
at
once
;
and
this
sink
my
very
soul
within
me
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
third
shock
be
over
,
and
I
feel
no
more
for
some
time
,
I
begin
to
take
courage
,
and
yet
I
have
not
heart
enough
to
get
over
my
wall
again
,
for
fear
of
be
bury
alive
,
but
sit
still
upon
the
ground
,
greatly
cast
down
and
disconsolate
,
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
all
this
while
I
have
not
the
least
serious
religious
thought
,
nothing
but
the
common
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
when
it
be
over
,
that
go
away
too
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
sit
thus
,
I
find
the
air
overcast
,
and
grow
cloudy
,
as
if
it
would
rain
;
soon
after
that
the
wind
rise
by
little
and
little
,
so
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
it
blow
a
most
dreadful
hurricane
<EOS>
:
the
sea
be
all
on
a
sudden
covered
over
with
foam
and
froth
,
the
shore
be
cover
with
the
breach
of
the
water
,
the
tree
be
tear
up
by
the
root
,
and
a
terrible
storm
it
be
;
and
this
hold
about
three
hour
,
and
then
begin
to
abate
,
and
in
two
hour
more
it
be
stark
calm
,
and
begin
to
rain
very
hard
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
I
sit
upon
the
ground
,
very
much
terrified
and
deject
,
when
on
a
sudden
it
come
into
my
thought
,
that
these
wind
and
rain
be
the
consequence
of
the
earthquake
,
the
earthquake
itself
be
spend
and
over
,
and
I
may
venture
into
my
cave
again
:
<EOS>
with
this
thought
my
spirit
begin
to
revive
,
and
the
rain
also
help
to
persuade
me
,
I
go
in
and
sit
down
in
my
tent
;
but
the
rain
be
so
violent
,
that
my
tent
be
ready
to
be
beat
down
with
it
;
and
I
be
force
to
go
into
my
cave
,
though
very
much
afraid
and
uneasy
,
for
fear
it
should
fall
on
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
this
violent
rain
force
me
to
a
new
work
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
cut
a
hole
through
my
new
fortification
like
a
sink
,
to
let
water
go
out
,
which
would
else
have
drown
my
cave
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
be
in
my
cave
some
time
,
and
find
still
no
more
shock
of
the
earthquake
follow
,
I
begin
to
be
more
composed
;
and
now
,
to
support
my
spirit
,
which
indeed
want
it
very
much
,
I
go
to
my
little
store
,
and
take
a
small
sup
of
rum
,
which
however
I
do
then
and
always
very
sparingly
,
know
I
could
have
no
more
when
that
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
It
continue
rain
all
that
night
,
and
great
part
of
the
next
day
,
so
that
I
could
not
stir
abroad
;
but
my
mind
be
more
composed
,
I
begin
to
think
of
what
I
have
best
do
,
conclude
,
that
if
the
island
be
subject
to
these
earthquake
,
there
would
be
no
live
for
me
in
a
cave
,
but
I
must
consider
of
build
me
some
little
hut
in
an
open
place
,
which
I
may
surround
with
a
wall
as
I
have
do
here
,
and
so
make
myself
secure
from
wild
beast
or
man
:
but
conclude
,
if
I
staid
where
I
be
,
I
should
certainly
,
one
time
or
other
,
be
bury
alive
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
thought
I
resolve
to
remove
my
tent
from
the
place
where
it
stand
,
which
be
just
under
the
hang
precipice
of
the
hill
,
and
which
,
if
it
should
be
shake
again
,
would
certainly
fall
upon
my
tent
.
<EOS>
and
I
spend
the
two
next
day
,
be
the
19th
and
20th
of
April
,
in
contrive
where
and
how
to
remove
my
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
the
fear
of
be
swallow
up
alive
,
make
me
that
I
never
sleep
in
quiet
,
and
<EOS>
yet
the
apprehension
of
lie
abroad
without
any
fence
be
almost
equal
to
it
;
but
still
,
when
I
look
about
and
see
how
every
thing
be
put
in
order
,
how
pleasantly
conceal
I
be
,
and
how
safe
from
danger
,
it
make
me
very
loth
to
remove
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
it
occur
to
me
that
it
would
require
a
vast
deal
of
time
for
me
to
do
this
,
and
that
I
must
be
content
to
run
the
venture
where
I
be
,
till
I
have
form
a
camp
for
myself
,
and
have
secure
it
so
as
to
remove
to
it
.
<EOS>
so
with
this
resolution
I
compose
myself
for
a
time
,
and
resolve
that
I
would
go
to
work
with
all
speed
to
build
me
a
wall
with
pile
and
cable
,
&
c.
in
a
circle
as
before
;
and
set
my
tent
up
in
it
when
it
be
finish
,
but
that
I
would
venture
to
stay
where
I
be
till
it
be
finish
and
fit
to
remove
to
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
21st
.
  
<EOS>
April
22
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
begin
to
consider
of
mean
to
put
this
resolve
in
execution
,
but
I
be
at
a
great
loss
about
my
tool
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
large
axis
and
abundance
of
hatchet
<EOS>
(
for
we
carry
the
hatchet
for
traffic
with
the
Indians
)
;
but
with
much
chopping
and
cut
knotty
hard
wood
,
they
be
all
full
of
notch
and
dull
;
and
though
I
have
a
grindstone
,
I
could
not
turn
it
and
grind
my
tool
too
:
<EOS>
this
cost
me
as
much
thought
as
a
statesman
would
have
bestow
upon
a
grand
point
of
politic
,
or
a
judge
upon
the
life
and
death
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
contrive
a
wheel
with
a
string
,
to
turn
it
with
my
foot
,
that
I
may
have
both
my
hand
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
note
,
I
have
never
see
any
such
thing
in
England
,
or
at
least
not
to
take
notice
how
it
be
do
,
though
since
I
have
observe
it
be
very
common
there
;
besides
that
,
my
grindstone
be
very
large
and
heavy
.
<EOS>
this
machine
cost
me
a
full
week
's
work
to
bring
it
to
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
April
28
,
29
.
<EOS>
these
two
whole
day
I
take
up
in
grind
my
tool
,
my
machine
for
turn
my
grindstone
perform
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
April
30
.
<EOS>
have
perceive
my
bread
have
be
low
a
great
while
,
now
I
take
a
survey
of
it
,
and
reduce
myself
to
one
biscuit
-
cake
a
day
,
which
make
my
heart
very
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
May
1
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
look
towards
the
sea
-
side
,
the
tide
be
low
,
I
see
something
lie
on
the
shore
big
than
ordinary
;
and
it
look
like
a
cask
;
when
I
come
to
it
,
I
find
a
small
barrel
,
and
two
or
three
piece
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
,
which
be
drive
on
shore
by
the
late
hurricane
;
and
look
towards
the
wreck
itself
,
I
think
it
seem
to
lie
high
out
of
the
water
than
it
use
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
examine
the
barrel
which
be
drive
on
shore
,
and
soon
find
it
be
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
,
but
it
have
take
water
,
and
the
powder
be
cake
as
hard
as
a
stone
;
however
,
I
roll
it
farther
on
shore
for
the
present
,
and
go
on
upon
the
sand
as
near
as
I
could
to
the
wreck
of
the
ship
,
to
look
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
down
to
the
ship
,
I
find
it
strangely
remove
;
the
forecastle
,
which
lie
before
bury
in
sand
,
be
heave
up
at
least
six
foot
;
and
the
stern
,
which
be
break
to
piece
,
and
part
from
the
rest
by
the
force
of
the
sea
,
soon
after
I
have
leave
rummage
her
,
be
toss
,
as
it
be
,
up
,
and
cast
on
one
side
,
and
the
sand
be
throw
so
high
on
that
side
next
her
stern
,
that
whereas
there
be
a
great
place
of
water
before
,
so
that
I
could
not
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
wreck
without
swimming
,
I
could
now
walk
quite
up
to
her
when
the
tide
be
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
with
this
at
first
,
but
soon
conclude
it
must
be
do
by
the
earthquake
:
and
as
by
this
violence
the
ship
be
more
break
open
than
formerly
,
so
many
thing
come
daily
on
shore
,
which
the
sea
have
loosen
,
and
which
the
wind
and
water
roll
by
degree
to
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
this
wholly
divert
my
thought
from
the
design
of
remove
my
habitation
;
and
I
busy
myself
mightily
,
that
day
especially
,
in
search
whether
I
could
make
any
way
into
the
ship
;
but
I
find
nothing
be
to
be
expect
of
that
kind
,
for
that
all
the
inside
of
the
ship
be
choke
up
with
sand
:
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
learn
not
to
despair
of
any
thing
,
I
resolve
to
pull
every
thing
to
piece
that
I
could
of
the
ship
,
conclude
,
that
every
thing
I
could
get
from
her
would
be
of
some
use
or
other
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
May

.
<EOS>
I
begin
with
my
saw
,
and
cut
a
piece
of
a
beam
through
,
which
I
think
hold
some
of
the
upper
part
or
quarter
-
deck
together
,
and
when
I
have
cut
it
through
,
I
clear
away
the
sand
as
well
as
I
could
from
the
side
which
lie
highest
;
but
the
tide
come
in
,
I
be
oblige
to
give
over
for
that
time

weary
of
my

when
just

off

I
catch
a
young
dolphin
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
me
a
long

of
some
rope
yarn

I
have
no

I
frequently
catch
fish
enough

as
much

<EOS>
no
rest
all
night
,
violent
pain
in
my
head
,
and
feverish
.
  
<EOS>
June
21
.
<EOS>
very
ill
,
fright
almost
to
death
with
the
apprehension
of
my
sad
condition
,
to
be
sick
,
and
no
help
.
<EOS>
pray
to
God
for
the
first
time
since
the
storm
off
Hull
,
but
scarce
know
what
I
say
,
or
why
;
my
thought
be
all
confused
.
  
<EOS>
June
22
.
<EOS>
a
little
better
,
but
under
dreadful
apprehension
of
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
June
23
.
<EOS>
very
bad
again
,
cold
and
shiver
,
and
then
a
violent
headach
.
  
<EOS>
June
24
.
<EOS>
much
well
.
  
<EOS>
June
25
.
<EOS>
an
ague
very
violent
;
the
fit
hold
me
seven
hour
,
cold
fit
and
hot
,
with
faint
sweat
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
June
26
.
<EOS>
well
;
and
have
no
victual
to
eat
,
take
my
gun
,
but
find
myself
very
weak
;
however
,
I
kill
a
she
-
goat
,
and
with
much
difficulty
get
it
home
,
and
broil
some
of
it
,
and
eat
;
I
would
fain
have
stew
it
,
and
make
some
broth
,
but
have
no
pot
.
  
<EOS>
June
27
.
<EOS>
the
ague
again
so
violent
,
that
I
lie
abed
all
day
,
and
neither
eat
or
drank
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
perish
for
thirst
,
but
so
weak
I
have
not
strength
to
stand
up
,
or
to
get
myself
any
water
to
drink
.
<EOS>
pray
to
God
again
,
but
be
light
-
head
;
and
when
I
be
not
I
be
so
ignorant
,
that
I
know
not
what
to
say
;
only
I
lie
and
cry
,
"
Lord
look
upon
me
!
<EOS>
Lord
pity
me
!
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
do
nothing
else
for
two
or
three
hour
,
till
the
fit
wear
off
,
I
fall
asleep
,
and
do
not
wake
till
far
in
the
night
;
when
I
wake
,
I
find
myself
much
refresh
,
but
weak
,
and
exceed
thirsty
:
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
no
water
in
my
whole
habitation
,
I
be
force
to
lie
till
morning
,
and
go
to
sleep
again
.
<EOS>
in
this
second
sleep
I
have
this
terrible
dream
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
be
sit
on
the
ground
on
the
outside
of
my
wall
,
where
I
sit
when
the
storm
blow
after
the
earthquake
,
and
that
I
see
a
man
descend
from
a
great
black
cloud
,
in
a
bright
flame
of
fire
,
and
light
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
be
all
over
as
bright
as
a
flame
,
so
that
I
could
but
just
bear
to
look
towards
him
;
his
countenance
be
most
inexpressibly
dreadful
,
impossible
for
word
to
describe
;
when
he
step
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
I
think
the
earth
tremble
,
just
as
it
have
do
before
in
the
earthquake
,
and
all
the
air
look
to
my
apprehension
as
if
it
have
be
fill
with
flash
of
fire
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
land
upon
the
earth
,
but
he
move
forward
towards
me
,
with
a
long
spear
or
weapon
in
his
hand
to
kill
me
;
and
when
he
come
to
a
rise
ground
,
at
some
distance
,
he
speak
to
me
,
or
I
hear
a
voice
so
terrible
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
express
the
terror
of
it
;
all
that
I
can
say
I
understand
be
this
,
"
see
all
these
thing
have
not
bring
thee
to
repentance
,
now
thou
shall
die
:
"
at
which
word
I
think
he
lift
up
the
spear
that
be
in
his
hand
to
kill
me
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
,
that
shall
ever
read
this
account
,
will
expect
that
I
should
be
able
to
describe
the
horror
of
my
soul
at
this
terrible
vision
;
I
mean
,
that
even
while
it
be
a
dream
,
I
even
dream
of
those
horror
;
nor
be
it
any
more
possible
to
describe
the
impression
that
remain
upon
my
mind
,
when
I
awake
,
and
find
it
be
but
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
alas
!
<EOS>
no
divine
knowledge
;
what
I
have
receive
by
the
good
instruction
of
my
father
be
then
wear
out
by
an
uninterrupted
series
,
for
eight
year
,
of
seafare
wickedness
,
and
a
constant
conversation
with
nothing
but
such
as
be
,
like
myself
,
wicked
and
profane
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
that
I
have
in
all
that
time
<EOS>
one
think
that
so
much
as
tend
either
to
look
upwards
toward
God
,
or
inward
towards
a
reflection
upon
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
but
a
certain
stupidity
of
soul
,
without
desire
of
good
,
or
conscience
of
evil
,
have
entirely
overwhelm
me
,
and
I
be
all
that
the
most
harden
,
unthinking
,
wicked
creature
among
our
common
sailor
can
be
suppose
to
be
,
not
have
the
least
sense
,
either
of
the
fear
of
God
in
danger
,
or
of
thankfulness
to
God
in
deliverance
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
relating
what
be
already
past
of
my
story
,
this
will
be
the
more
easily
believe
,
when
I
shall
add
,
that
through
all
the
variety
of
misery
that
have
to
this
day
befall
me
<EOS>
,
I
never
have
so
much
as
one
thought
of
it
be
the
hand
of
God
,
or
that
it
be
a
just
punishment
for
my
sin
,
my
rebellious
behaviour
against
my
father
,
or
my
present
sin
,
which
be
great
;
or
so
much
as
a
punishment
for
the
general
course
of
my
wicked
life
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
on
the
desperate
expedition
on
the
desert
shore
of
Africa
,
I
never
have
so
much
as
one
thought
of
what
would
become
of
me
;
or
one
wish
to
God
to
direct
me
whither
<EOS>
I
should
go
,
or
to
keep
me
from
the
danger
which
apparently
surround
me
,
as
well
from
voracious
creature
as
cruel
savage
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
merely
thoughtless
of
a
God
,
or
a
Providence
,
act
like
a
mere
brute
from
the
principle
of
nature
,
and
by
the
dictate
of
common
sense
only
,
and
indeed
hardly
that
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
deliver
,
and
take
up
at
sea
by
the
Portugal
captain
,
well
used
,
and
deal
justly
and
honourably
with
,
as
well
as
charitably
,
I
have
not
the
least
thankfulness
on
my
thought
.
<EOS>
when
again
I
be
shipwreck
,
ruin
,
and
in
danger
of
drown
on
this
island
,
I
be
as
far
from
remorse
,
or
look
on
it
as
a
judgment
;
I
only
say
to
myself
often
,
that
I
be
an
unfortunate
dog
,
and
bear
to
be
always
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
when
I
get
on
shore
first
here
,
and
find
all
my
ship
's
crew
drown
,
and
myself
spare
,
I
be
surprised
with
a
kind
of
ecstasy
,
and
some
transport
of
soul
,
which
,
have
the
grace
of
God
assist
,
may
have
come
up
to
true
thankfulness
;
but
it
end
where
it
begin
,
in
a
mere
common
flight
of
joy
,
or
,
as
I
may
say
,
be
glad
I
be
alive
,
without
the
least
reflection
upon
the
distinguish
goodness
of
the
Hand
which
have
preserve
me
,
and
have
single
me
out
to
be
preserve
,
when
all
the
rest
be
destroy
;
or
an
inquiry
why
Providence
have
be
thus
merciful
to
me
;
even
just
the
same
common
sort
of
joy
which
seaman
generally
have
,
after
they
have
get
safe
on
shore
from
a
shipwreck
,
which
they
drown
all
in
the
next
bowl
of
punch
,
and
forget
almost
as
soon
as
it
be
over
;
and
all
the
rest
of
my
life
be
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
even
when
I
be
afterwards
,
on
due
consideration
,
make
sensible
of
my
condition
,
how
I
be
cast
on
this
dreadful
place
,
out
of
the
reach
of
human
kind
,
out
of
all
hope
of
relief
,
or
prospect
of
redemption
,
as
soon
as
I
see
but
a
prospect
of
living
,
and
that
I
should
not
starve
and
perish
for
hunger
,
all
the
sense
of
my
affliction
wear
off
,
and
I
begin
to
be
very
easy
,
apply
myself
to
the
work
proper
for
my
preservation
and
supply
,
and
be
far
enough
from
be
afflict
at
my
condition
,
as
a
judgment
from
Heaven
,
or
as
the
hand
of
God
against
me
:
<EOS>
these
be
thought
which
very
seldom
enter
into
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
the
grow
up
of
the
corn
,
as
be
hint
in
my
Journal
,
have
at
first
some
little
influence
upon
me
,
and
begin
to
affect
me
with
seriousness
,
as
long
as
I
think
it
have
something
miraculous
in
it
;
but
as
soon
as
ever
that
part
of
thought
be
remove
,
all
the
impression
which
be
raise
from
it
wear
off
also
,
as
I
have
note
already
.
  
<EOS>
even
the
earthquake
,
though
nothing
could
be
more
terrible
in
its
nature
,
or
more
immediately
direct
to
the
invisible
Power
which
alone
direct
such
thing
;
yet
no
sooner
be
the
first
fright
over
,
but
the
impression
it
have
make
go
off
also
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
sense
of
God
,
or
his
judgment
,
much
less
of
the
present
affliction
of
my
circumstance
be
from
his
hand
,
than
if
I
have
be
in
the
most
prosperous
condition
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
I
begin
to
be
sick
,
and
a
leisurely
view
of
the
misery
of
death
come
to
place
itself
before
me
;
when
my
spirit
begin
to
sink
under
the
burden
of
a
strong
distemper
,
and
nature
be
exhaust
with
the
violence
of
the
fever
;
conscience
,
that
have
sleep
so
long
,
begin
to
awake
,
and
I
begin
to
reproach
myself
with
my
past
life
,
in
which
I
have
so
evidently
,
by
uncommon
wickedness
,
provoke
the
justice
of
God
to
lay
me
under
uncommon
stroke
,
and
to
deal
with
me
in
so
vindictive
a
manner
.
  
<EOS>
these
reflection
oppress
me
from
the
second
or
third
day
of
my
distemper
,
and
in
the
violence
,
as
well
of
the
fever
as
of
the
dreadful
reproach
of
my
conscience
,
extort
some
word
from
me
,
like
pray
to
God
,
though
I
can
not
say
they
be
either
a
prayer
attend
with
desire
,
or
with
hope
;
it
be
rather
the
voice
of
mere
fright
and
distress
;
my
thought
be
confuse
,
the
conviction
great
upon
my
mind
,
and
the
horror
of
die
in
such
a
miserable
condition
,
raise
vapour
into
my
head
with
the
mere
apprehension
;
and
,
in
these
hurry
of
my
soul
,
I
know
not
what
my
tongue
may
express
:
but
it
be
rather
exclamation
,
such
as
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
miserable
creature
be
I
!
<EOS>
if
I
should
be
sick
,
I
shall
certainly
die
for
want
of
help
,
and
what
will
become
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
then
the
tear
burst
out
of
my
eye
,
and
I
could
say
no
more
for
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
interval
,
the
good
advice
of
my
father
come
to
my
mind
;
and
presently
his
prediction
,
which
I
mention
in
the
beginning
of
this
story
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
if
I
do
take
this
foolish
step
,
God
would
not
bless
me
,
and
I
would
have
leisure
hereafter
to
reflect
upon
have
neglect
his
counsel
,
when
there
may
be
none
to
assist
in
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
I
aloud
,
"
my
dear
father
's
word
be
come
to
pass
:
God
's
justice
have
overtake
me
,
and
I
have
none
to
help
or
hear
me
:
<EOS>
I
reject
the
voice
of
Providence
,
which
have
mercifully
put
me
in
a
posture
or
station
of
life
wherein
I
may
have
be
happy
and
easy
;
but
I
would
neither
see
it
myself
,
nor
learn
to
know
the
blessing
of
it
from
my
parent
;
I
leave
them
to
mourn
over
my
folly
,
and
now
I
be
leave
to
mourn
under
the
consequence
of
it
:
<EOS>
I
refuse
their
help
and
assistance
,
who
would
have
lift
me
into
the
world
,
and
would
have
make
every
thing
easy
to
me
;
and
now
I
have
difficulty
to
struggle
with
,
too
great
for
even
nature
itself
to
support
,
and
no
assistance
,
no
help
,
no
comfort
,
no
advice
.
<EOS>
"
then
I
cry
out
,
"
Lord
be
my
help
,
for
I
be
in
great
distress
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
prayer
,
if
I
may
call
it
so
,
that
I
have
make
for
many
year
.
<EOS>
but
I
return
to
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
June
28
.
<EOS>
have
be
somewhat
refresh
with
the
sleep
I
have
have
,
and
the
fit
be
entirely
off
,
I
get
up
:
and
though
the
fright
and
terror
of
my
dream
be
very
great
,
yet
<EOS>
I
consider
,
that
the
fit
of
the
ague
would
return
again
the
next
day
,
and
now
be
my
time
to
get
something
to
refresh
and
support
myself
when
I
should
be
ill
;
and
the
first
thing
I
do
,
I
fill
a
large
square
case
-
bottle
with
water
,
and
set
it
upon
my
table
,
in
reach
of
my
bed
;
and
to
take
off
the
chill
or
aguish
disposition
of
the
water
,
I
put
about
a
quarter
of
a
pint
of
rum
into
it
,
and
mix
them
together
;
then
I
get
me
a
piece
of
the
goat
's
flesh
,
and
broil
it
on
the
coal
,
but
could
eat
very
little
.
<EOS>
I
walk
about
,
but
be
very
weak
,
and
withal
very
sad
and
heavy
-
hearted
under
a
sense
of
my
miserable
condition
,
dread
the
return
of
my
distemper
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
at
night
I
make
my
supper
of
three
of
the
turtle
's
egg
,
which
I
roast
in
the
ashe
,
and
eat
,
as
we
call
it
,
in
the
shell
;
and
this
be
the
first
bit
of
meat
I
have
ever
ask
God
's
blessing
to
,
even
,
as
I
could
remember
,
in
my
whole
life
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
eat
I
try
to
walk
;
but
find
myself
so
weak
,
that
I
could
hardly
carry
the
gun
(
for
I
never
go
out
without
that
)
:
<EOS>
so
I
go
but
a
little
way
,
and
sit
down
upon
the
ground
,
look
out
upon
the
sea
,
which
be
just
before
me
,
and
very
calm
and
smooth
.
<EOS>
as
I
sit
here
,
some
such
thought
as
these
occur
to
me
:
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
earth
and
sea
,
of
which
I
have
see
so
much
?
<EOS>
Whence
be
it
produce
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
I
,
and
all
the
other
creature
,
wild
and
tame
,
human
and
brutal
?
<EOS>
whence
be
we
?
  
<EOS>
sure
we
be
all
make
by
some
secret
Power
,
who
form
the
earth
and
sea
,
the
air
and
sky
;
and
who
be
that
?
  
<EOS>
then
it
follow
,
most
naturally
:
it
be
God
that
have
make
it
all
:
<EOS>
well
,
but
then
it
come
on
strangely
;
if
God
have
make
all
these
thing
,
he
guide
and
govern
them
all
,
and
all
thing
that
concern
them
;
for
the
being
that
could
make
all
thing
,
must
certainly
have
power
to
guide
and
direct
them
.
  
<EOS>
if
so
,
nothing
can
happen
in
the
great
circuit
of
his
work
,
either
without
his
knowledge
or
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
and
if
nothing
happen
without
his
knowledge
,
he
know
that
I
be
here
,
and
be
in
a
dreadful
condition
;
and
if
nothing
happen
without
his
appointment
,
he
have
appoint
all
this
to
befal
me
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
occur
to
my
thought
to
contradict
any
of
these
conclusion
;
and
therefore
it
rest
upon
me
with
the
great
force
,
that
it
must
need
be
,
that
God
have
appoint
all
this
to
befal
me
;
that
I
be
bring
to
this
miserable
circumstance
by
his
direction
<EOS>
,
he
have
the
sole
power
,
not
of
me
only
,
but
of
every
thing
that
happen
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
immediately
it
follow
,
  
why
have
God
do
this
to
me
?
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
to
be
thus
use
?
  
<EOS>
My
conscience
presently
check
me
in
that
inquiry
,
as
if
I
have
blaspheme
;
and
methought
it
speak
to
me
,
like
a
voice
;
"
wretch
!
<EOS>
dost
thou
ask
what
thou
hast
do
?
<EOS>
look
back
upon
a
dreadful
mispent
life
,
and
ask
thyself
what
thou
hast
not
do
?
<EOS>
ask
,
why
be
it
that
thou
wert
not
long
ago
destroy
?
<EOS>
why
wert
thou
not
drown
in
Yarmouth
Roads
?
<EOS>
kill
in
the
fight
when
the
ship
be
take
by
the
Sallee
man
of
war
?
<EOS>
devour
by
the
wild
beast
on
the
coast
of
Africa
?
<EOS>
or
,
drown
here
,
when
all
the
crew
perish
but
thyself
?
<EOS>
Dost
thou
ask
,
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
with
these
reflection
as
one
astonish
,
and
have
not
a
word
to
say
,
no
,
not
to
answer
to
myself
:
but
rise
up
pensive
and
sad
,
walk
back
to
my
retreat
,
and
go
up
over
my
wall
,
as
if
I
have
be
go
to
bed
;
but
my
thought
be
sadly
disturb
,
and
I
have
no
inclination
to
sleep
;
so
I
sit
down
in
my
chair
,
and
light
my
lamp
,
for
it
begin
to
be
dark
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
the
apprehension
of
the
return
of
my
distemper
terrify
me
very
much
,
it
occur
to
my
thought
,
that
the
Brasilians
take
no
physic
but
their
tobacco
,
for
almost
all
distemper
;
and
I
have
a
piece
of
a
roll
of
tobacco
in
one
of
the
chest
,
which
be
quite
cure
,
and
some
also
that
be
green
,
and
not
quite
cure
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
,
direct
by
Heaven
,
no
doubt
;
for
in
this
chest
I
find
a
cure
both
for
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
I
open
the
chest
,
and
find
what
I
look
for
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
tobacco
;
and
as
the
few
book
I
have
save
lie
there
too
<EOS>
,
I
take
out
one
of
the
Bibles
which
I
mention
before
,
and
which
,
to
this
time
,
I
have
not
find
leisure
,
or
so
much
as
inclination
,
to
look
into
;
I
say
I
take
it
out
,
and
bring
both
that
and
the
tobacco
with
me
to
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
what
use
to
make
of
the
tobacco
I
know
not
,
as
to
my
distemper
,
or
whether
it
be
good
for
it
or
no
<EOS>
;
but
I
try
several
experiment
with
it
,
as
if
I
be
resolve
it
should
hit
one
way
or
other
:
I
first
take
a
piece
of
a
leaf
,
and
chew
it
in
my
mouth
,
which
indeed
at
first
almost
stupifie
my
brain
,
the
tobacco
be
green
and
strong
,
and
that
I
have
not
be
much
use
to
it
;
then
I
take
some
,
and
steep
it
an
hour
or
two
in
some
rum
,
and
resolve
to
take
a
dose
of
it
when
I
lie
down
;
and
lastly
,
I
burn
some
upon
a
pan
of
coal
,
and
hold
my
nose
close
over
the
smoke
of
it
,
as
long
as
I
could
bear
it
,
as
well
for
the
heat
as
the
virtue
of
it
,
and
I
hold
almost
to
suffocation
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
this
operation
I
take
up
the
Bible
,
and
begin
to
read
;
but
my
head
be
too
much
disturb
with
the
tobacco
to
bear
reading
,
at
least
at
that
time
;
only
have
open
the
book
casually
,
the
first
word
that
occur
to
me
be
these
:
"
call
on
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
I
will
deliver
,
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
be
very
apt
to
my
case
,
and
make
some
impression
upon
my
thought
at
the
time
of
read
them
,
though
not
so
much
as
they
do
afterwards
;
for
as
for
be
deliver
,
the
word
have
no
sound
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
me
;
the
thing
be
so
remote
,
so
impossible
in
my
apprehension
of
thing
,
that
I
begin
to
say
as
the
child
of
Israel
do
,
when
they
be
promise
flesh
to
eat
,
"
Can
God
spread
a
table
in
the
wilderness
?
"
<EOS>
so
I
begin
to
say
,
Can
God
himself
deliver
me
from
this
place
?
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
not
for
many
year
that
any
hope
appear
,
this
prevail
very
often
upon
my
thought
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
the
word
make
a
very
great
impression
upon
me
,
and
I
muse
upon
them
very
often
.
<EOS>
It
grow
now
late
,
and
the
tobacco
have
,
as
I
say
,
doze
my
head
so
much
,
that
I
incline
to
sleep
;
so
that
I
leave
my
lamp
burn
in
the
cave
,
lest
I
should
want
any
thing
in
the
night
,
and
go
to
bed
;
but
before
I
lie
down
,
I
do
what
I
never
have
do
in
all
my
life
:
<EOS>
I
kneel
down
,
and
pray
to
God
to
fulfil
the
promise
to
me
,
that
if
I
call
upon
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
he
would
deliver
me
.
<EOS>
after
my
broken
and
imperfect
prayer
be
over
,
I
drink
the
rum
in
which
I
have
steep
the
tobacco
,
which
be
so
strong
and
rank
of
the
tobacco
,
that
indeed
I
could
scarce
get
it
down
.
<EOS>
immediately
upon
this
I
go
to
bed
,
and
I
find
presently
it
fly
up
into
my
head
violently
;
but
I
fall
into
a
sound
sleep
,
and
wake
no
more
,
<EOS>
till
by
the
sun
it
must
necessarily
be
near
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
next
day
;
nay
,
to
this
hour
I
be
partly
of
the
opinion
,
that
I
sleep
all
the
next
day
and
night
,
and
till
almost
three
the
day
after
;
for
otherwise
I
know
not
how
I
should
lose
a
day
out
of
my
reckoning
in
the
day
of
the
week
,
as
it
appear
some
year
after
I
have
do
;
for
if
I
have
lose
it
by
cross
and
recrosse
the
line
,
I
should
have
lose
more
than
a
day
;
but
in
my
account
it
be
lose
,
and
I
never
know
which
way
.
  
<EOS>
be
that
however
one
way
or
other
;
when
I
awake
,
I
find
myself
exceedingly
refresh
,
and
my
spirit
lively
and
cheerful
;
when
I
get
up
,
I
be
strong
than
I
be
the
day
before
,
and
my
stomach
better
;
for
I
be
hungry
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
have
no
fit
the
next
day
,
but
continue
much
alter
for
the
well
:
this
be
the
29th
.
  
<EOS>
the
30th
be
my
well
day
of
course
,
and
I
go
abroad
with
my
gun
,
but
do
not
care
to
travel
too
far
:
<EOS>
I
kill
a
sea
-
fowl
or
two
,
something
like
a
brand
goose
,
and
bring
them
home
,
but
be
not
very
forward
to
eat
them
:
<EOS>
so
I
eat
some
more
of
the
turtle
's
egg
,
which
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
this
evening
I
renew
the
medicine
which
I
have
suppose
do
me
good
the
day
before
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
tobacco
steep
in
rum
;
only
I
do
not
take
so
much
as
before
,
nor
do
I
chew
any
of
the
leaf
,
or
hold
my
head
over
the
smoke
;
however
,
I
be
not
so
well
the
next
day
,
which
be
the
1st
of
July
,
<EOS>
as
I
hope
I
should
have
be
;
for
I
have
a
little
spice
of
the
cold
fit
,
but
it
be
not
much
.
  
<EOS>
July
2
.
<EOS>
I
renew
the
medicine
all
the
three
way
,
and
doze
myself
with
it
at
first
,
and
double
the
quantity
which
I
drink
.
  
<EOS>
July
3
.
<EOS>
I
miss
the
fit
for
good
and
all
,
though
I
do
not
recover
my
full
strength
for
some
week
after
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
thus
gather
strength
,
my
thought
run
exceedingly
upon
this
scripture
,
"
I
will
deliver
thee
;
"
and
the
impossibility
of
my
deliverance
lie
much
upon
my
mind
,
in
bar
of
my
ever
expect
it
:
but
as
I
be
discourage
myself
with
such
thought
,
it
occur
to
my
mind
,
that
I
pore
so
much
upon
my
deliverance
from
the
main
affliction
,
that
I
disregard
the
deliverance
I
have
receive
;
and
I
be
,
as
it
be
,
make
to
ask
myself
such
question
as
these
;
viz
.
<EOS>
have
I
not
be
deliver
,
and
wonderfully
too
,
from
sickness
?
<EOS>
from
the
most
distressed
condition
that
could
be
,
and
that
be
so
frightful
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
what
notice
have
I
take
of
it
?
<EOS>
have
I
do
my
part
?
<EOS>
God
have
deliver
me
;
but
I
have
not
glorify
him
:
that
be
to
say
,
I
have
not
own
and
be
thankful
for
that
as
a
deliverance
;
and
how
could
I
expect
great
deliverance
?
  
<EOS>
this
touch
my
heart
very
much
,
and
immediately
I
kneel
down
,
and
give
God
thank
aloud
,
for
my
recovery
from
my
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
July
4
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
take
the
Bible
;
and
,
begin
at
the
New
Testament
,
I
begin
seriously
to
read
it
,
and
impose
upon
myself
to
read
a
while
every
morning
and
every
night
,
not
tie
myself
to
the
number
of
chapter
,
but
as
long
as
my
thought
should
engage
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
I
set
seriously
to
this
work
,
but
I
find
my
heart
more
deeply
and
sincerely
affected
with
the
wickedness
of
my
past
life
;
the
impression
of
my
dream
revive
,
and
<EOS>
the
word
,
"
all
these
thing
have
not
bring
thee
to
repentance
,
"
run
seriously
in
my
thought
:
<EOS>
I
be
earnestly
beg
of
God
to
give
me
repentance
,
when
it
happen
providentially
the
very
day
,
<EOS>
that
,
read
the
scripture
,
I
come
to
these
word
,
"
He
be
exalt
a
Prince
,
and
a
Saviour
,
to
give
repentance
,
and
to
give
remission
.
<EOS>
"
I
throw
down
the
book
,
and
with
my
heart
as
well
as
my
hand
lift
up
to
heaven
,
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
of
joy
,
I
cry
out
aloud
,
"
Jesus
,
thou
Son
of
David
,
Jesus
,
thou
exalt
Prince
and
Saviour
,
give
me
repentance
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
that
I
could
say
,
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
,
that
I
pray
in
all
my
life
;
for
now
I
pray
with
a
sense
of
my
condition
,
and
with
a
true
scripture
view
of
hope
,
found
on
the
encouragement
of
the
word
of
God
;
and
from
this
time
,
I
may
say
,
I
begin
to
have
hope
that
God
would
hear
me
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
begin
to
construe
the
word
mention
above
,
"
call
on
me
,
and
I
will
deliver
thee
,
"
in
a
different
sense
from
what
I
have
ever
do
before
;
for
then
I
have
no
notion
of
any
thing
be
call
deliverance
,
but
my
being
deliver
from
the
captivity
I
be
in
;
for
though
I
be
indeed
at
large
in
the
place
,
yet
the
island
be
certainly
a
prison
to
me
,
and
that
in
the
bad
sense
in
the
world
;
but
now
I
learn
to
take
it
in
another
sense
.
<EOS>
now
I
look
back
upon
my
past
life
with
such
horror
,
and
my
sin
appear
so
dreadful
,
that
my
soul
seek
nothing
of
God
,
but
deliverance
from
the
load
of
guilt
that
bear
down
all
my
comfort
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
solitary
life
,
it
be
nothing
;
I
do
not
so
much
as
pray
to
be
deliver
from
it
,
or
think
of
it
;
it
be
all
of
no
consideration
in
comparison
of
this
;
and
I
add
this
part
here
,
to
hint
to
whoever
shall
read
it
,
that
whenever
they
come
to
a
true
sense
of
thing
,
they
will
find
deliverance
from
sin
a
much
great
blessing
than
deliverance
from
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
leave
this
part
,
I
return
to
my
journal
.
<EOS>
My
condition
begin
now
to
be
,
though
not
less
miserable
as
to
my
way
of
living
,
yet
much
easy
to
my
mind
;
and
my
thought
be
direct
,
by
a
constant
read
the
scripture
,
and
pray
to
God
,
to
thing
of
a
high
nature
,
I
have
a
great
deal
of
comfort
within
,
which
till
now
I
know
nothing
of
;
also
as
my
health
and
strength
return
,
I
bestir
myself
to
furnish
myself
with
every
thing
that
I
want
,
and
make
my
way
of
living
as
regular
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
4th
of
July
to
the
14th
,
I
be
chiefly
employ
in
walk
about
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
a
little
and
a
little
at
a
time
,
as
a
man
that
be
gather
up
his
strength
after
a
fit
of
sickness
;
for
it
be
hardly
to
be
imagine
how
low
I
be
,
and
to
what
weakness
I
be
reduce
.
<EOS>
the
application
which
I
make
use
of
be
perfectly
new
,
and
perhaps
what
have
never
cure
an
ague
before
;
neither
can
I
recommend
it
to
any
one
to
practise
by
this
experiment
;
and
though
it
do
carry
off
the
fit
,
yet
it
rather
contribute
to
weaken
me
;
for
I
have
frequent
convulsion
in
my
nerve
and
limb
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
learn
from
it
also
this
in
particular
,
<EOS>
that
be
abroad
in
the
rainy
season
be
the
most
pernicious
thing
to
my
health
that
could
be
,
especially
in
those
rain
which
come
attend
with
storm
and
hurricane
of
wind
;
for
as
the
rain
which
come
in
a
dry
season
be
always
most
accompanied
with
such
storm
,
so
I
find
this
rain
be
much
more
dangerous
than
the
rain
which
fall
in
September
and
October
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
now
in
this
unhappy
island
above
ten
month
;
all
possibility
of
deliverance
from
this
condition
seem
to
be
entirely
take
from
me
;
and
I
firmly
believe
that
no
human
shape
have
ever
set
foot
upon
that
place
.
<EOS>
have
now
secure
my
habitation
,
as
I
think
,
fully
to
my
mind
,
I
have
a
great
desire
to
make
a
more
perfect
discovery
of
the
island
,
and
to
see
what
other
production
I
may
find
,
which
yet
I
know
nothing
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
15th
of
July
that
I
begin
to
take
a
more
particular
survey
of
the
island
itself
.
<EOS>
I
go
up
the
creek
first
,
where
,
as
I
hint
,
I
bring
my
raft
on
shore
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
after
I
come
about
two
mile
up
,
that
the
tide
do
not
flow
any
higher
,
and
that
it
be
no
more
than
a
little
brook
of
running
water
,
and
very
fresh
and
good
:
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
dry
season
<EOS>
,
there
be
hardly
any
water
in
some
part
of
it
,
at
least
not
enough
to
run
into
any
stream
,
so
as
it
could
be
perceive
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
bank
of
this
brook
I
find
many
pleasant
savanna
or
meadow
,
plain
,
smooth
,
and
cover
with
grass
;
and
on
the
rise
part
of
them
next
to
the
high
ground
,
where
the
water
,
as
it
may
be
suppose
,
never
overflow
,
I
find
a
great
deal
of
tobacco
,
green
,
and
grow
to
a
great
and
very
strong
stalk
:
there
be
diver
other
plant
which
I
have
no
notion
of
,
or
understand
about
;
and
may
perhaps
have
virtue
of
their
own
,
which
I
could
not
find
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
search
for
the
cassave
root
,
which
the
Indians
in
all
that
climate
make
their
bread
of
,
but
I
could
find
none
.
<EOS>
I
see
large
plant
of
aloe
,
but
do
not
then
understand
them
:
<EOS>
I
see
several
sugar
-
cane
,
but
wild
,
and
,
for
want
of
cultivation
,
imperfect
.
<EOS>
I
content
myself
with
these
discovery
for
this
time
,
and
come
back
,
muse
with
myself
what
course
I
may
take
to
know
the
virtue
and
goodness
of
any
of
the
fruit
or
plant
which
I
should
discover
,
but
could
bring
it
to
no
conclusion
;
for
,
in
short
,
I
have
make
so
little
observation
while
I
be
in
the
Brasils
,
that
I
know
little
of
the
plant
of
the
field
,
at
least
very
little
that
may
serve
me
to
any
purpose
now
in
my
distress
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
the
16th
,
I
go
up
the
same
way
again
;
and
,
after
go
something
farth
than
I
have
do
the
day
before
,
I
find
the
brook
and
the
savanna
begin
to
cease
,
and
the
country
become
more
woody
than
before
.
<EOS>
in
this
part
I
find
different
fruit
,
and
particularly
I
find
melon
upon
the
ground
in
great
abundance
,
and
grape
upon
the
tree
;
the
vine
have
spread
indeed
over
the
tree
,
and
the
cluster
of
grape
be
just
now
in
their
prime
,
very
ripe
and
rich
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
surprising
discovery
,
and
I
be
exceed
glad
of
them
;
but
I
be
warn
by
my
experience
to
eat
sparingly
of
them
,
remember
,
that
when
I
be
ashore
in
Barbary
,
the
eating
of
grape
kill
several
of
our
englishman
who
be
slave
there
,
by
throw
them
into
flux
and
fever
:
but
I
find
an
excellent
use
for
these
grape
,
and
that
be
to
cure
or
dry
them
in
the
sun
,
and
keep
them
as
dry
grape
or
raisin
be
keep
,
which
I
think
would
be
,
as
indeed
they
be
,
as
wholesome
,
and
as
agreeable
to
eat
,
when
no
grape
may
be
have
.
  
<EOS>
I
spend
all
that
evening
there
,
and
go
not
back
to
my
habitation
,
which
by
the
way
be
the
first
night
,
as
I
may
say
,
I
have
lain
from
home
.
<EOS>
in
the
night
I
take
my
first
contrivance
,
and
get
up
into
a
tree
,
where
I
sleep
well
,
and
the
next
morning
proceed
upon
my
discovery
,
travel
near
four
mile
,
as
I
may
judge
by
the
length
of
the
valley
,
keep
still
due
north
,
with
a
ridge
of
hill
on
the
south
and
north
side
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
this
march
I
come
to
an
opening
,
where
the
country
seem
to
descend
to
the
west
;
and
a
little
spring
of
fresh
water
,
which
issue
out
of
the
side
of
the
hill
by
me
,
run
the
other
way
,
that
is
,
due
east
;
and
the
country
appear
so
fresh
,
so
green
,
so
flourish
,
every
thing
be
in
a
constant
verdure
or
flourish
of
spring
,
that
it
look
like
a
plant
garden
.
  
<EOS>
I
descend
a
little
on
the
side
of
that
delicious
valley
,
survey
it
with
a
secret
kind
of
pleasure
(
though
mix
with
other
afflict
thought
)
to
think
that
this
be
all
my
own
,
that
I
be
king
and
lord
of
all
this
country
indefeasibly
,
and
have
a
right
of
possession
;
and
if
I
could
convey
it
,
I
may
have
it
in
inheritance
,
as
completely
as
any
lord
of
a
manor
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
see
here
abundance
of
cocoa
-
tree
,
orange
and
lemon
,
and
citron
-
tree
,
but
all
wild
,
and
few
bear
any
fruit
;
at
least
,
not
then
:
however
,
the
green
lime
that
I
gather
be
not
only
pleasant
to
eat
,
but
very
wholesome
;
and
I
mix
their
juice
afterwards
with
water
,
which
make
it
very
wholesome
,
and
very
cool
and
refreshing
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
now
I
have
business
enough
to
gather
and
carry
home
;
and
resolve
to
lay
up
a
store
,
as
well
of
grape
as
lime
and
lemon
,
to
furnish
myself
for
the
wet
season
,
which
I
know
be
approach
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
do
this
I
gather
a
great
heap
of
grape
in
one
place
,
and
a
less
heap
in
another
place
,
and
a
great
parcel
of
lime
and
lemon
in
another
place
;
and
take
a
few
of
each
with
me
,
I
travel
homeward
,
and
resolve
to
come
again
,
and
bring
a
bag
or
sack
,
or
what
I
could
make
,
to
carry
the
rest
home
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
have
spend
three
day
in
this
journey
,
I
come
home
(
so
I
must
now
call
my
tent
,
and
my
cave
;
)
but
before
I
get
thither
,
the
grape
be
spoil
;
the
richness
of
the
fruit
,
and
the
weight
of
the
juice
,
have
break
them
,
and
bruise
them
,
they
be
good
for
little
or
nothing
:
<EOS>
as
to
the
lime
,
they
be
good
,
but
I
could
bring
but
a
few
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
be
the
19th
,
I
go
back
,
have
make
me
two
small
bag
to
bring
home
my
harvest
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
surprised
,
when
come
to
my
heap
of
grape
,
which
be
so
rich
and
fine
<EOS>
when
I
gather
them
,
I
find
them
all
spread
abroad
,
tread
to
piece
,
and
drag
about
,
some
here
,
some
there
,
and
abundance
eat
and
devour
.
<EOS>
by
this
I
conclude
there
be
some
wild
creature
thereabout
,
which
have
do
this
;
but
what
they
be
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
find
there
be
no
lay
them
up
on
heap
,
and
no
carry
them
away
in
a
sack
,
but
that
one
way
they
would
be
destroy
,
and
the
other
way
they
would
be
crush
with
their
own
weight
,
I
take
another
course
;
for
I
gather
a
large
quantity
of
the
grape
,
and
hang
them
upon
the
out
branch
of
the
tree
,
that
they
may
cure
and
dry
in
the
sun
;
and
as
for
the
lime
and
lemon
,
I
carry
as
many
back
as
I
could
well
stand
under
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
home
from
this
journey
,
I
contemplate
with
great
pleasure
on
the
fruitfulness
of
that
valley
,
and
the
pleasantness
of
the
situation
,
the
security
from
storm
on
that
side
of
the
water
,
and
the
wood
;
and
conclude
that
I
have
pitch
upon
a
place
to
fix
my
abode
,
which
be
by
far
the
bad
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
begin
to
consider
of
remove
my
habitation
,
and
to
look
out
for
a
place
equally
safe
as
where
I
now
be
situate
,
if
possible
,
in
that
pleasant
fruitful
part
of
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
this
thought
run
long
in
my
head
,
and
I
be
exceed
fond
of
it
for
some
time
,
the
pleasantness
of
the
place
tempt
me
;
but
when
I
come
to
a
nearer
view
of
it
,
and
to
consider
that
I
be
now
by
the
sea
-
side
,
where
it
be
at
least
possible
that
something
may
happen
to
my
advantage
,
and
that
the
same
ill
fate
that
bring
me
hither
may
bring
some
other
unhappy
wretch
to
the
same
place
;
and
though
it
be
scarce
probable
that
any
such
thing
should
ever
happen
,
yet
to
enclose
myself
among
the
hill
and
wood
,
in
the
centre
of
the
island
,
be
to
anticipate
my
bondage
,
and
to
render
such
an
affair
not
only
improbable
,
but
impossible
;
and
that
therefore
I
ought
not
by
any
mean
to
remove
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
so
enamoured
with
this
place
,
that
I
spend
much
of
my
time
there
for
the
whole
remain
part
of
the
month
of
July
;
and
though
,
upon
second
thought
,
I
resolve
as
above
,
not
to
remove
,
yet
I
build
me
a
little
kind
of
a
bower
,
and
surround
it
at
a
distance
with
a
strong
fence
,
be
a
double
hedge
,
as
high
as
I
could
reach
,
well
stake
and
fill
between
with
brushwood
;
and
here
I
lie
very
secure
,
sometimes
two
or
three
night
together
,
always
go
over
it
with
a
ladder
,
as
before
;
<EOS>
so
that
I
fancy
now
<EOS>
I
have
my
country
house
,
and
my
sea
-
coast
house
:
<EOS>
and
this
work
take
me
up
the
beginning
of
August
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
newly
finish
my
fence
,
and
begin
to
enjoy
my
labour
,
but
the
rain
come
on
,
and
make
me
stick
close
to
my
first
habitation
;
for
though
I
have
make
me
a
tent
like
the
other
,
with
a
piece
of
a
sail
,
and
spread
it
very
well
,
yet
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
shelter
of
a
hill
to
keep
me
from
storm
,
nor
a
cave
behind
me
to
retreat
into
when
the
rain
be
extraordinary
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
beginning
of
August
,
as
I
say
,
I
have
finish
my
bower
,
and
begin
to
enjoy
myself
.
<EOS>
the
3d
of
August
<EOS>
I
find
the
grape
I
have
hang
up
be
perfectly
dry
,
and
indeed
be
excellent
good
raisin
of
the
sun
;
so
I
begin
to
take
them
down
from
the
tree
,
and
it
be
very
happy
that
I
do
so
;
for
the
rain
which
follow
would
have
spoil
them
,
and
I
have
lose
the
good
part
of
my
winter
food
;
for
I
have
above
two
hundred
large
bunche
of
them
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
I
take
them
all
down
,
and
carry
most
of
them
home
to
my
cave
,
but
it
begin
to
rain
;
and
from
thence
,
which
be
the
14th
of
August
<EOS>
,
it
rain
more
or
less
every
day
,
till
the
middle
of
October
;
and
sometimes
so
violently
,
that
I
could
not
stir
out
of
my
cave
for
several
day
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
season
I
be
much
surprised
with
the
increase
of
my
family
:
I
have
be
concern
for
the
loss
of
one
of
my
cat
,
who
run
away
from
me
,
or
,
as
I
think
,
have
be
dead
;
and
I
hear
no
more
tale
or
tiding
of
her
,
till
to
my
astonishment
she
come
home
about
the
end
of
August
,
with
three
kitten
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
more
strange
to
me
,
because
though
I
have
kill
a
wild
cat
,
as
I
call
it
,
with
my
gun
,
yet
I
think
it
be
a
quite
different
kind
from
our
european
cat
;
yet
the
young
cat
be
the
same
kind
of
house
breed
like
the
old
one
;
and
both
my
cat
be
female
,
I
think
it
very
strange
:
but
from
these
three
cat
I
afterwards
come
to
be
so
pester
with
cat
,
that
I
be
force
to
kill
them
like
vermin
,
or
wild
beast
,
and
to
drive
them
from
my
house
as
much
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
14th
of
August
to
the
26th
,
incessant
rain
,
so
that
I
could
not
stir
,
and
be
now
very
careful
not
to
be
much
wet
.
<EOS>
in
this
confinement
I
begin
to
be
straiten
for
food
;
but
venture
out
twice
,
I
one
day
kill
a
goat
:
and
the
last
day
,
which
be
the
26th
,
find
a
very
large
tortoise
,
which
be
a
treat
to
me
,
and
my
food
be
regulate
thus
:
I
eat
a
bunch
of
raisin
for
my
breakfast
,
a
piece
of
the
goat
's
flesh
,
or
of
the
turtle
,
for
my
dinner
,
broil
(
for
,
to
my
great
misfortune
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
vessel
to
boil
or
stew
any
thing
;
)
and
two
or
three
of
the
turtle
's
egg
for
supper
.
<EOS>
during
this
confinement
in
my
cover
by
the
rain
,
I
work
daily
two
or
three
hour
at
enlarge
my
cave
;
and
,
by
degree
,
work
it
on
towards
one
side
,
till
I
come
to
the
outside
of
the
hill
,
and
make
a
door
or
way
out
,
which
come
beyond
my
fence
or
wall
;
and
so
I
come
in
and
out
this
way
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
perfectly
easy
at
lie
so
open
;
for
as
I
have
manage
myself
before
,
I
be
in
a
perfect
enclosure
,
whereas
now
I
think
I
lie
expose
;
and
yet
I
could
not
perceive
that
there
be
any
live
thing
to
fear
,
the
big
creature
that
I
have
see
upon
the
island
be
a
goat
.

September
the
30th
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
come
to
the
unhappy
anniversary
of
my
landing
:
I
cast
up
the
notch
on
my
post
,
and
find
I
have
be
on
shore
three
hundred
and
sixty
-
five
day
.
<EOS>
I
keep
this
day
as
a
solemn
fast
,
set
it
apart
to
a
religious
exercise
,
prostrate
myself
to
the
ground
with
the
most
serious
humiliation
,
confess
myself
to
God
,
acknowledge
his
righteous
judgment
upon
me
,
and
pray
to
him
to
have
mercy
on
me
,
through
Jesus
Christ
;
and
have
not
taste
the
least
refreshment
for
twelve
hour
,
even
till
the
go
down
of
the
sun
,
I
then
eat
a
biscuit
-
cake
and
a
bunch
of
grape
,
and
go
to
bed
,
finish
the
day
as
I
begin
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
all
this
time
observe
no
sabbath
-
day
;
for
as
at
first
I
have
no
sense
of
religion
upon
my
mind
,
I
have
after
some
time
omit
to
distinguish
the
week
,
by
make
a
long
notch
than
ordinary
for
the
sabbath
-
day
,
and
so
do
not
really
know
what
any
of
the
day
be
;
but
now
,
have
cast
up
the
day
as
before
,
I
find
I
have
be
there
a
year
;
so
I
divide
it
into
week
,
and
set
apart
every
seventh
day
for
a
sabbath
;
though
I
find
at
the
end
of
my
account
I
have
lose
a
day
or
two
of
my
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
after
this
my
ink
begin
to
fail
me
,
and
so
I
content
myself
to
use
it
more
sparingly
,
and
to
write
down
only
the
most
remarkable
event
of
my
life
,
without
continue
a
daily
memorandum
of
other
thing
.
  
<EOS>
the
rainy
season
,
and
the
dry
season
,
begin
now
to
appear
regular
to
me
,
and
I
learn
to
divide
them
so
as
to
provide
for
them
accordingly
.
<EOS>
but
I
buy
all
my
experience
before
I
have
it
;
and
this
I
be
go
to
relate
,
be
one
of
the
most
discouraging
experiment
that
I
make
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
mention
,
that
I
have
save
the
few
ear
of
barley
and
rice
which
I
have
so
surprisingly
find
spring
up
,
as
I
think
,
of
themselves
,
and
believe
there
be
about
thirty
stalk
of
rice
,
and
about
twenty
of
barley
:
and
now
I
think
it
a
proper
time
to
sow
it
after
the
rain
,
the
sun
be
in
its
southern
position
go
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
dig
up
a
piece
of
ground
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
with
my
wooden
spade
,
and
divide
it
into
two
part
,
I
sow
my
grain
;
but
as
I
be
sow
,
it
casually
occur
to
my
thought
,
that
I
would
not
sow
it
all
at
first
,
because
I
do
not
know
when
be
the
proper
time
for
it
;
so
I
sow
about
two
third
of
the
seed
,
leave
about
a
handful
of
each
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
afterwards
that
I
do
so
;
for
not
one
grain
of
that
I
sow
this
time
come
to
any
thing
;
for
the
dry
month
follow
,
the
earth
have
have
no
rain
after
the
seed
be
sow
,
it
have
no
moisture
to
assist
its
growth
,
and
never
come
up
at
all
,
till
the
wet
season
have
come
again
,
and
then
it
grow
as
if
it
have
be
newly
sow
.
  
<EOS>
find
my
first
seed
do
not
grow
,
which
I
easily
imagine
be
by
the
drought
,
I
seek
for
a
moister
piece
of
ground
to
make
another
trial
in
;
and
I
dig
up
a
piece
of
ground
near
my
new
bower
,
and
sow
the
rest
of
my
seed
in
February
,
a
little
before
the
vernal
equinox
;
and
this
,
have
the
rainy
month
of
March
and
April
to
water
it
,
spring
up
very
pleasantly
,
and
yield
a
very
good
crop
;
but
have
part
of
the
seed
leave
only
,
and
not
daring
to
sow
all
that
I
have
yet
,
I
have
but
a
small
quantity
at
last
,
my
whole
crop
not
amount
to
above
half
a
peck
of
each
kind
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
this
experience
I
be
make
master
of
my
business
,
and
know
exactly
when
the
proper
season
be
to
sow
;
and
that
I
may
expect
two
seed
-
time
,
and
two
harvest
,
every
year
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
corn
be
grow
,
I
make
a
little
discovery
,
which
be
of
use
to
me
afterwards
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
rain
be
over
,
and
the
weather
begin
to
settle
,
which
be
about
the
month
of
November
,
I
make
a
visit
up
the
country
to
my
bower
,
where
though
I
have
not
be
some
month
,
yet
I
find
all
thing
just
as
I
leave
them
.
<EOS>
the
circle
or
double
hedge
that
I
have
make
,
be
not
only
firm
and
entire
,
but
the
stake
which
I
have
cut
off
of
some
tree
that
grow
thereabout
,
be
all
shoot
out
,
and
grow
with
long
branch
,
as
much
as
a
willow
tree
usually
shoot
the
first
year
after
lop
its
head
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
what
tree
to
call
it
that
these
stake
be
cut
from
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
,
and
yet
<EOS>
very
well
pleased
,
to
see
the
young
tree
grow
;
and
I
prune
them
,
and
lead
them
up
to
grow
as
much
alike
as
I
could
;
and
it
be
scarce
credible
,
how
beautiful
a
figure
they
grow
into
in
three
year
;
so
that
though
the
hedge
make
a
circle
of
about
twenty
-
five
yard
in
diameter
,
yet
the
tree
,
for
such
I
may
now
call
them
,
soon
cover
it
;
and
it
be
a
,
complete
shade
,
sufficient
to
lodge
under
all
the
dry
season
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
me
resolve
to
cut
some
more
stake
,
and
make
me
an
hedge
like
this
in
a
semicircle
round
my
wall
,
I
mean
that
of
my
first
dwelling
,
which
I
do
;
and
place
the
tree
or
stake
in
a
double
row
,
at
above
eight
yard
distance
from
my
first
fence
,
they
grow
presently
,
and
be
at
first
a
fine
cover
to
my
habitation
,
and
afterwards
serve
for
a
defence
also
,
as
I
shall
observe
in
its
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
now
,
that
the
season
of
the
year
may
generally
be
divide
,
not
into
summer
and
winter
,
as
in
Europe
,
but
into
the
rainy
season
and
the
dry
season
,
which
be
generally
thus

Half

the
rainy
season
sometimes
hold
longer
or
short
,
as
the
wind
happen
to
blow
;
but
this
be
the
general
observation
I
make
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
find
,
by
experience
,
the
ill
consequence
of
be
abroad
in
the
rain
,
I
take
care
to
furnish
myself
with
provision
beforehand
,
that
I
may
not
be
oblige
to
go
out
;
and
I
sit
within
door
as
much
as
possible
during
the
wet
month
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
time
I
find
much
employment
,
(
and
very
suitable
also
to
the
time
)
for
I
find
great
occasion
of
many
thing
which
I
have
no
way
to
furnish
myself
with
,
but
by
hard
labour
and
constant
application
;
particularly
,
I
try
many
way
to
make
myself
a
basket
;
but
all
the
twig
I
could
get
for
the
purpose
prove
so
brittle
,
that
they
would
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
prove
of
excellent
advantage
to
me
now
,
that
when
I
be
a
boy
I
use
to
take
great
delight
in
stand
at
a
basket
-
maker
be
in
the
town
where
my
father
live
,
to
see
them
make
their
wicker
-
ware
;
and
be
,
as
boy
usually
be
,
very
officious
to
help
,
and
a
great
observer
of
the
manner
how
they
work
those
thing
,
and
sometimes
lend
an
hand
,
I
have
by
this
means
so
full
knowledge
of
the
method
of
it
,
that
I
want
nothing
but
the
material
;
when
it
come
into
my
mind
,
that
the
twig
of
that
tree
from
whence
I
cut
my
stake
that
grow
,
may
possibly
be
as
tough
as
the
sallow
,
and
willow
,
and
osier
,
in
England
;
and
I
resolve
to
try
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
the
next
day
I
go
to
my
country
-
house
,
as
I
call
it
,
and
cut
some
of
the
small
twig
<EOS>
,
I
find
them
to
my
purpose
as
much
as
I
could
desire
;
whereupon
I
come
the
next
time
prepare
with
an
hatchet
to
cut
down
a
quantity
,
which
I
soon
find
,
for
there
be
a
great
plenty
of
them
:
<EOS>
these
I
set
up
to
dry
within
my
circle
or
hedge
;
and
when
they
be
fit
for
use
,
I
carry
them
to
my
cave
;
and
here
during
the
next
season
I
employ
myself
in
make
(
as
well
as
I
could
)
a
great
many
basket
,
both
to
carry
earth
,
or
to
carry
or
lay
up
any
thing
,
as
I
have
occasion
;
and
though
I
do
not
finish
them
very
handsomely
,
yet
I
make
them
sufficiently
serviceable
for
my
purpose
;
and
thus
afterwards
I
take
care
never
to
be
without
them
;
and
as
my
wicker
-
ware
decay
I
make
more
;
especially
I
make
strong
deep
basket
to
place
my
corn
in
,
instead
of
sack
,
when
I
should
come
to
have
any
quantity
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
master
this
difficulty
,
and
employ
a
world
of
time
about
it
,
I
bestir
myself
to
see
,
if
possible
,
how
to
supply
two
want
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
vessel
to
hold
any
thing
that
be
liquid
,
except
two
rundlet
,
which
be
almost
full
of
rum
,
and
some
glass
bottle
,
some
of
the
common
size
,
and
other
which
be
case
-
bottle
square
,
for
the
holding
of
water
,
spirit
,
&
c.
<EOS>
I
have
not
so
much
as
a
pot
to
boil
any
thing
in
,
except
a
great
kettle
which
I
save
out
of
the
ship
,
and
which
be
too
big
for
such
use
as
I
desire
it
for
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
make
broth
,
and
stew
a
bit
of
meat
by
itself
.
<EOS>
the
second
thing
I
would
fain
have
have
,
be
a
tobacco
-
pipe
,
but
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
make
one
;
however
,
I
find
a
contrivance
for
that
too
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
I
employ
myself
in
plant
my
second
row
of
stake
of
pile
,
and
in
this
wicker
-
work
,
all
the
summer
,
or
dry
season
;
when
another
business
take
me
up
more
time
than
it
could
be
imagine
I
could
spare
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
before
,
that
I
have
a
great
mind
to
see
the
whole
island
,
and
that
I
have
travel
up
the
brook
,
and
so
on
to
where
I
build
my
bower
,
and
where
I
have
an
opening
quite
to
the
sea
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
.
<EOS>
I
now
resolve
to
travel
quite
across
to
the
sea
shore
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
so
take
my
gun
and
hatchet
,
and
my
dog
,
and
a
large
quantity
of
powder
and
shot
than
usual
,
with
two
biscuit
-
cake
and
a
great
bunch
of
raisin
in
my
pouch
,
for
my
store
,
I
begin
my
journey
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
pass
the
vale
where
my
bower
stand
,
as
above
,
I
come
within
view
of
the
sea
,
to
the
west
;
and
it
be
a
very
clear
day
,
I
fairly
descry
land
,
whether
an
island
or
continent
I
could
not
tell
;
but
it
lie
very
high
,
extend
from
the
west
to
the
W.S.W.
at
a
very
great
distance
;
by
my
guess
it
could
not
be
less
than
fifteen
or
twenty
league
off
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
what
part
of
the
world
this
may
be
,
otherwise
than
that
I
know
it
must
be
part
of
America
;
and
,
as
I
conclude
by
all
my
observation
,
must
be
near
the
spanish
dominion
,
and
perhaps
be
all
inhabit
by
savage
,
where
if
I
should
have
land
,
I
have
be
in
a
bad
condition
than
I
be
now
;
and
therefore
I
acquiesce
in
the
disposition
of
Providence
,
which
I
begin
now
to
own
,
and
to
believe
,
order
every
thing
for
the
good
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
I
quiet
my
mind
with
this
,
and
leave
afflict
myself
with
fruitless
wish
of
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
after
some
pause
upon
this
affair
,
I
consider
,
that
if
this
land
be
the
spanish
coast
,
I
should
certainly
,
one
time
or
other
,
see
some
vessel
pass
or
repass
one
way
or
other
;
but
if
not
,
then
it
be
the
savage
coast
between
the
spanish
country
and
Brasil
,
which
be
indeed
the
bad
of
savage
;
for
they
be
cannibal
,
or
man
-
eater
,
and
fail
not
to
murder
and
devour
all
the
human
body
that
fall
into
their
hand
.
<EOS>
with
these
consideration
I
walk
very
leisurely
forward
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
side
of
the
island
where
I
now
be
,
much
pleasanter
than
mine
,
the
open
or
savanna
field
sweet
,
adorn
with
flower
and
grass
,
and
full
of
very
fine
wood
.
<EOS>
I
see
abundance
of
parrot
,
and
fain
would
I
have
catch
one
,
if
possible
,
to
have
keep
it
to
be
tame
,
and
teach
it
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
after
some
painstaking
,
catch
a
young
parrot
;
for
I
knock
it
down
with
a
stick
,
and
have
recover
it
,
I
bring
it
home
,
but
it
be
some
year
before
I
could
make
him
speak
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
I
teach
him
to
call
me
by
my
name
very
familiarly
:
but
the
accident
that
follow
,
though
it
be
a
trifle
,
will
be
very
divert
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
divert
with
this
journey
:
I
find
in
the
low
ground
,
hare
,
as
I
think
them
to
be
,
and
fox
,
but
they
differ
greatly
from
all
the
other
kind
I
have
meet
with
;
nor
could
I
satisfy
myself
to
eat
them
,
though
I
kill
several
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
need
to
be
venturous
;
for
I
have
no
want
of
food
,
and
of
that
which
be
very
good
too
;
especially
these
three
sort
,
viz
.
<EOS>
goat
,
pigeon
,
and
turtle
or
tortoise
;
which
add
to
my
grape
.
<EOS>
leadenhall
-
market
could
not
have
furnish
a
well
table
than
I
,
in
proportion
to
the
company
:
and
though
my
case
be
deplorable
enough
,
yet
I
have
great
cause
for
thankfulness
,
that
I
be
not
drive
to
any
extremity
for
food
;
but
rather
plenty
,
even
to
dainty
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
travel
in
this
journey
above
two
mile
outright
in
a
day
,
or
thereabout
;
but
I
look
so
many
turn
and
return
,
to
see
what
discovery
I
could
make
,
that
I
come
weary
enough
to
the
place
where
I
resolve
to
sit
down
for
all
night
;
and
then
either
repose
myself
in
a
tree
,
or
surround
myself
with
a
row
of
stake
set
upright
in
the
ground
,
either
from
one
tree
to
another
,
or
so
as
no
wild
creature
could
come
at
me
without
wake
me
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
come
to
the
sea
-
shore
,
I
be
surprised
to
see
that
I
have
take
up
my
lot
on
the
bad
side
of
the
island
;
for
here
indeed
the
shore
be
cover
with
innumerable
turtle
,
whereas
on
the
other
side
I
have
find
but
three
in
a
year
and
an
half
.
<EOS>
here
be
also
an
infinite
number
of
fowl
of
many
kind
,
some
of
which
I
have
not
see
before
,
and
many
of
them
very
good
meat
;
but
such
as
I
know
not
the
name
of
except
those
call
penguin
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
have
shoot
as
many
as
I
please
,
but
be
very
spare
of
my
powder
and
shoot
:
and
therefore
have
more
mind
to
kill
a
she
-
goat
,
if
I
could
,
which
I
could
better
feed
on
:
and
though
there
be
many
goat
here
more
than
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
yet
it
be
with
much
more
difficulty
that
I
could
come
near
them
;
the
country
be
flat
and
even
,
and
they
see
me
much
sooner
than
when
I
be
on
the
hill
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
this
side
of
the
country
be
much
pleasanter
than
mine
,
but
yet
I
have
not
the
least
inclination
to
remove
;
for
as
I
be
fix
in
my
habitation
,
it
become
natural
to
me
,
and
I
seem
all
the
while
I
be
here
to
be
,
as
it
be
,
upon
a
journey
,
and
from
home
:
however
,
I
travel
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
towards
the
east
,
I
suppose
,
about
twelve
mile
;
and
then
set
up
a
great
pole
upon
the
shore
for
a
mark
,
I
conclude
I
would
go
home
again
;
and
the
next
journey
I
take
should
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
east
from
my
dwelling
,
and
so
round
,
till
I
come
to
my
post
again
:
of
which
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
another
way
to
come
back
than
that
I
go
,
think
I
could
easily
keep
all
the
island
so
much
in
my
view
,
that
I
could
not
miss
find
my
first
dwelling
by
view
the
country
;
but
I
find
myself
mistaken
;
for
be
come
about
two
or
three
mile
,
I
find
myself
descend
into
a
very
large
valley
;
but
so
surround
with
hill
,
and
those
hill
cover
with
wood
,
that
I
could
not
see
which
be
my
way
by
any
direction
but
that
of
the
sun
;
nor
even
then
,
unless
I
know
very
well
the
position
of
the
sun
at
that
time
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
,
to
my
farth
misfortune
,
that
the
weather
prove
hazy
for
three
or
four
day
,
while
I
be
in
this
valley
;
and
not
be
able
to
see
the
sun
,
I
wander
about
very
uncomfortably
,
and
at
last
be
oblige
to
find
out
the
sea
-
side
,
look
for
my
post
,
and
come
back
the
same
way
I
go
;
and
then
by
easy
journie
<EOS>
I
turn
homeward
,
the
weather
be
exceed
hot
;
and
my
gun
,
ammunition
,
hatchet
,
and
other
thing
,
very
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
journey
my
dog
surprise
a
young
kid
,
and
seize
upon
it
;
and
I
run
in
to
take
hold
of
it
,
catch
it
,
and
save
it
alive
from
the
dog
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
mind
to
bring
it
home
,
if
I
could
;
for
I
have
often
be
muse
whether
it
may
not
be
possible
to
get
a
kid
or
two
,
and
so
raise
a
breed
of
tame
goat
,
which
may
supply
me
when
my
powder
and
shot
should
be
spend
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
a
collar
for
this
little
creature
,
and
with
a
string
which
I
make
of
some
rope
-
yarn
,
which
I
always
carry
about
me
,
I
lead
him
along
,
though
with
some
difficulty
,
till
I
come
to
my
bower
,
and
there
I
enclose
him
,
and
leave
him
;
for
I
be
very
impatient
to
be
at
home
,
<EOS>
from
whence
I
have
be
absent
above
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
what
a
satisfaction
<EOS>
it
be
to
me
to
come
into
my
old
hutch
,
and
lie
down
in
my
hammock
-
bed
:
this
little
wander
journey
,
without
a
settled
place
of
abode
,
have
be
so
unpleasant
to
me
that
my
own
house
,
as
I
call
it
to
myself
,
be
a
perfect
settlement
to
me
,
compare
to
that
;
and
it
render
every
thing
about
me
so
comfortable
,
that
I
resolve
I
would
never
go
a
great
way
from
it
again
,
while
it
should
be
my
lot
to
stay
on
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
I
repose
myself
here
a
week
,
to
rest
and
regale
myself
after
my
long
journey
;
during
which
,
most
of
the
time
be
take
up
in
the
weighty
affair
of
make
a
cage
for
my
Pol
,
who
begin
now
to
be
a
mere
domestic
,
and
to
be
mighty
well
acquainted
with
me
.
<EOS>
then
I
begin
to
think
of
the
poor
kid
,
which
I
have
pen
in
within
my
little
circle
,
and
resolve
to
go
and
fetch
it
home
,
and
give
it
some
food
;
accordingly
I
go
,
and
find
it
where
I
leave
it
;
for
indeed
it
could
not
get
out
,
but
be
almost
starve
for
want
of
food
;
I
go
and
cut
bough
of
tree
and
branch
of
such
shrub
as
I
could
find
,
and
throw
it
over
,
and
have
feed
it
,
I
tie
it
as
I
do
before
to
lead
it
away
;
but
it
be
so
tame
with
be
hungry
,
that
I
have
no
need
to
have
tie
it
;
for
it
follow
me
like
a
dog
;
and
as
I
continually
feed
it
,
the
creature
become
so
loving
,
so
gentle
,
and
so
fond
,
that
it
become
from
that
time
one
of
my
domestic
also
,
and
would
never
leave
me
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
the
rainy
season
of
the
autumnal
equinox
be
now
come
,
and
I
keep
the
30th
of
September
in
the
same
solemn
manner
as
before
,
be
the
anniversary
of
my
landing
on
the
island
,
have
now
be
there
two
year
,
and
no
more
prospect
of
be
deliver
than
the
first
day
I
come
there
.
<EOS>
I
spend
the
whole
day
in
humble
and
thankful
acknowledgment
of
the
many
wonderful
mercy
which
my
solitary
condition
be
attend
with
,
and
without
which
it
may
have
be
infinitely
more
miserable
.
<EOS>
I
give
humble
and
hearty
thank
,
that
God
have
be
pleased
to
discover
to
me
even
that
it
be
possible
I
may
be
more
happy
in
this
solitary
condition
than
I
should
have
be
in
a
liberty
of
society
,
and
in
all
the
pleasure
of
the
world
:
that
he
could
fully
make
up
to
me
the
deficiency
of
my
solitary
state
,
and
the
want
of
human
society
,
by
his
presence
,
and
the
communication
of
his
grace
to
my
soul
,
support
,
comfort
,
and
encourage
me
to
depend
upon
his
providence
here
,
and
hope
for
his
eternal
presence
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
that
I
begin
sensibly
to
feel
how
much
more
happy
<EOS>
the
life
I
now
lead
be
,
with
all
its
miserable
circumstance
,
than
the
wicked
,
cursed
,
abominable
life
<EOS>
I
lead
all
the
past
part
of
my
day
;
and
now
,
have
change
both
my
sorrow
and
my
joy
,
my
very
desire
alter
,
my
affection
change
their
gust
,
and
my
delight
be
perfectly
new
from
what
they
be
at
first
come
,
or
indeed
for
the
two
year
past
.
  
<EOS>
before
,
as
I
walk
about
,
either
on
my
hunting
,
or
for
view
the
country
,
the
anguish
of
my
soul
at
my
condition
would
break
out
upon
me
on
a
sudden
,
and
my
very
heart
would
die
within
me
,
to
think
of
the
wood
,
the
mountain
,
the
desert
I
be
in
;
and
how
I
be
a
prisoner
,
lock
up
with
the
eternal
bar
and
bolt
of
the
ocean
,
in
an
uninhabited
wilderness
,
without
redemption
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
great
composure
of
my
mind
,
this
would
break
out
upon
me
like
a
storm
,
and
make
me
wre
my
hand
,
and
weep
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
sometimes
it
would
take
me
in
the
middle
of
my
work
,
and
I
would
immediately
sit
down
and
sigh
,
and
look
upon
the
ground
for
an
hour
or
two
together
,
and
this
be
still
bad
to
me
;
for
if
I
could
burst
out
into
tear
,
or
vent
myself
by
word
,
it
would
go
off
;
and
the
grief
,
have
exhaust
itself
,
would
abate
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
I
begin
to
exercise
myself
with
new
thought
;
I
daily
read
the
word
of
God
,
and
apply
all
the
comfort
of
it
to
my
present
state
.
<EOS>
one
morning
be
very
sad
,
I
open
the
Bible
upon
these
word
,
"
I
will
never
,
never
leave
thee
,
nor
forsake
thee
!
"
<EOS>
immediately
it
occur
,
that
these
word
be
to
me
,
why
else
should
they
be
direct
in
such
a
manner
,
just
at
the
moment
when
I
be
mourn
over
my
condition
,
as
one
forsaken
of
God
and
man
?
"
<EOS>
well
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
God
do
not
forsake
me
,
of
what
ill
consequence
can
it
be
,
or
what
matter
it
,
though
the
world
should
all
forsake
me
;
see
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
I
have
all
the
world
,
and
should
lose
the
favour
and
blessing
of
God
,
there
would
be
no
comparison
in
the
loss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
from
this
moment
I
begin
to
conclude
in
my
mind
,
that
it
be
possible
for
me
to
be
more
happy
in
this
forsaken
,
solitary
condition
,
than
it
be
probable
<EOS>
I
should
have
ever
be
in
any
other
particular
state
in
the
world
;
and
with
this
thought
I
be
go
to
give
thank
to
God
for
bring
me
to
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
it
be
,
but
something
shock
my
mind
at
that
thought
,
and
I
durst
not
speak
the
word
,
"
how
canst
thou
be
such
an
hypocrite
,
"
say
I
,
even
audibly
,
"
to
pretend
to
be
thankful
for
a
condition
,
which
,
however
thou
mayst
endeavour
to
be
content
with
,
thou
wouldst
rather
pray
heartily
to
be
deliver
from
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
stop
there
;
but
though
I
could
not
say
I
thank
God
for
be
there
,
yet
I
sincerely
give
thank
to
God
for
open
my
eye
,
by
whatever
afflicting
providence
,
to
see
the
former
condition
,
of
my
life
,
and
to
mourn
for
my
wickedness
,
and
repent
.
<EOS>
I
never
open
the
Bible
,
or
shut
it
,
but
my
very
soul
within
me
bless
God
for
direct
my
friend
in
England
,
without
any
order
of
mine
,
to
pack
it
up
among
my
good
;
and
for
assist
me
afterwards
to
save
it
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
and
in
this
disposition
of
mind
,
I
begin
my
third
year
;
and
though
I
have
not
give
the
reader
the
trouble
of
so
particular
an
account
of
my
work
this
year
as
at
the
first
,
yet
in
general
it
may
be
observe
,
that
I
be
very
seldom
idle
;
have
regularly
divide
my
time
,
accord
to
the
several
daily
employment
that
be
before
me
;
such
as
,
first
,
my
duty
to
God
,
and
read
the
scripture
,
which
I
constantly
set
apart
some
time
for
,
thrice
,
every
day
:
secondly
,
the
go
abroad
with
my
gun
for
food
,
which
generally
take
me
up
three
hour
every
morning
when
it
do
not
rain
:
thirdly
,
the
ordering
,
cure
,
preserve
,
and
cook
what
I
have
kill
or
catch
for
my
supply
;
these
take
up
great
part
of
the
day
:
also
it
be
to
be
consider
,
that
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
the
sun
be
in
the
zenith
,
the
violence
of
the
heat
be
too
great
to
stir
out
;
so
that
about
four
hour
in
the
evening
be
all
the
time
I
could
be
suppose
to
work
in
;
with
this
exception
,
that
sometimes
I
change
my
hour
of
hunting
and
working
,
and
go
to
work
in
the
morning
,
and
abroad
with
my
gun
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
short
time
allow
for
labour
,
I
desire
may
be
add
the
exceed
laboriousness
of
my
work
;
the
many
hour
,
which
for
want
of
tool
,
want
of
help
,
and
want
of
skill
,
every
thing
that
I
do
,
take
up
out
of
my
time
:
for
example
,
I
be
full
two
-
and
-
forty
day
make
me
a
board
for
a
long
shelf
,
which
I
want
in
my
cave
;
whereas
two
sawyer
,
with
their
tool
and
saw
-
pit
,
would
have
cut
six
of
them
out
of
the
same
tree
in
half
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
My
case
be
this
:
it
be
to
be
a
large
tree
which
be
to
be
cut
down
,
because
my
board
be
to
be
a
broad
one
.
<EOS>
the
tree
I
be
three
day
a
cutting
down
,
and
two
more
cut
off
the
bough
,
and
reduce
it
to
a
log
,
or
piece
of
timber
.
<EOS>
with
inexpressible
hacking
and
hew
<EOS>
I
reduce
both
the
side
of
it
into
chip
,
till
it
begin
to
be
light
enough
to
move
;
then
I
turn
it
,
and
make
one
side
of
it
smooth
and
flat
,
as
a
board
,
from
end
to
end
:
then
turn
that
side
downward
,
cut
the
other
side
till
I
bring
the
plank
to
be
about
three
inch
thick
,
and
smooth
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
any
one
may
judge
the
labour
of
my
hand
in
such
a
piece
of
work
;
but
labour
and
patience
carry
me
through
that
and
many
other
thing
;
I
only
observe
this
in
particular
,
to
shew
the
reason
why
so
much
of
my
time
go
away
with
so
little
work
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
what
may
be
a
little
to
be
do
with
help
and
tool
,
be
a
vast
labour
,
and
require
a
prodigious
time
to
do
alone
,
and
by
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
this
,
with
patience
and
labour
,
I
go
through
many
thing
,
and
indeed
ever
thing
that
my
circumstance
make
necessary
for
me
to
do
,
as
will
appear
by
what
follow
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
the
month
of
November
and
December
,
expect
my
crop
of
barley
and
rice
.
<EOS>
the
ground
I
have
manure
or
dig
up
for
them
be
not
great
;
for
,
as
I
observe
,
my
seed
of
each
,
be
not
above
the
quantity
of
half
a
peck
;
for
I
have
lose
one
whole
crop
by
sow
in
the
dry
season
;
but
now
my
crop
promise
very
well
,
when
on
a
sudden
I
find
I
be
in
danger
of
lose
it
all
again
by
enemy
of
several
sort
,
which
it
be
scarce
possible
to
keep
from
it
;
as
first
,
the
goat
,
and
wild
creature
which
I
call
hare
,
which
,
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
blade
,
lie
in
it
night
and
day
,
as
soon
as
it
come
up
,
and
eat
it
so
close
,
that
it
could
get
no
time
to
shoot
up
into
stalk
.
  
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
see
no
remedy
for
,
but
by
make
an
enclosure
about
it
with
a
hedge
,
which
I
do
with
a
great
deal
of
toil
;
and
the
more
,
because
it
require
a
great
deal
of
speed
;
the
creature
daily
spoil
my
corn
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
my
arable
land
be
but
small
,
suited
to
my
crop
,
I
get
it
totally
well
fence
in
about
three
week
time
,
and
shoot
some
of
the
creature
in
the
day
-
time
<EOS>
,
I
set
my
dog
to
guard
it
in
the
night
,
tie
him
up
to
a
stake
at
the
gate
,
where
he
would
stand
and
bark
all
night
long
;
so
in
a
little
time
the
enemy
forsook
the
place
,
and
the
corn
grow
very
strong
and
well
,
and
begin
to
ripen
apace
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
beast
ruin
me
before
,
while
my
corn
be
in
the
blade
,
so
the
bird
be
as
likely
to
ruin
me
now
,
when
it
be
in
the
ear
<EOS>
;
for
go
along
by
the
place
to
see
how
it
throve
,
I
see
my
little
crop
surround
with
fowl
of
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
how
many
sort
,
which
stand
as
it
be
watch
till
I
should
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
let
fly
among
them
(
for
I
always
have
my
gun
with
me
.
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
shoot
,
but
there
arise
up
a
little
cloud
of
fowl
,
which
I
have
not
see
at
all
,
from
among
the
corn
itself
.
  
<EOS>
this
touch
me
sensibly
;
for
I
foresaw
,
that
in
a
few
day
they
would
devour
all
my
hope
;
that
I
should
be
starve
,
and
never
be
able
to
raise
a
crop
at
all
;
and
what
to
do
I
could
not
tell
:
however
,
I
resolve
not
to
lose
my
corn
,
if
possible
,
though
I
should
watch
it
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
go
among
it
to
see
what
damage
be
already
do
,
and
find
they
have
spoil
a
good
deal
of
it
;
but
that
,
as
it
be
yet
too
green
for
them
,
the
loss
be
not
so
great
,
but
the
remainder
be
like
to
be
a
good
crop
,
if
it
could
be
save
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
by
it
to
load
my
gun
,
and
then
come
away
,
I
could
easily
see
the
thief
sit
upon
all
the
tree
about
me
,
as
if
they
only
wait
till
I
be
go
away
,
and
the
event
prove
it
to
be
so
;
for
as
I
walk
off
as
if
I
be
go
,
I
be
no
sooner
out
of
their
sight
,
but
they
drop
down
one
by
one
into
the
corn
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
provoke
,
that
I
could
not
have
patience
to
stay
till
more
<EOS>
come
on
,
know
that
every
grain
that
they
eat
now
be
,
as
it
may
be
say
,
a
peck
loaf
to
me
in
the
consequence
;
but
come
up
to
the
hedge
<EOS>
,
I
fire
again
,
and
kill
three
of
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
wish
for
;
so
I
take
them
up
,
and
serve
them
as
we
serve
notorious
thief
in
England
,
viz
.
<EOS>
hang
them
in
chain
for
a
terror
to
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
imagine
almost
,
that
this
should
have
such
an
effect
as
it
have
;
for
the
fowl
would
not
only
not
come
at
the
corn
,
but
in
short
they
forsook
all
that
part
of
the
island
,
and
I
could
never
see
a
bird
near
the
place
as
long
as
my
scarecrow
hang
there
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
be
very
glad
of
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
;
and
about
the
latter
end
of
December
,
which
be
our
second
harvest
of
the
year
,
I
reap
my
corn
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sadly
put
to
it
for
a
scythe
or
a
sickle
to
cut
it
down
,
and
all
I
could
do
be
to
make
one
as
well
as
I
could
out
of
one
of
the
broad
-
sword
,
or
cutlass
,
which
I
save
among
the
arm
out
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
my
crop
be
but
small
,
I
have
no
great
difficulty
to
cut
it
down
:
in
short
,
I
reap
it
my
way
,
for
I
cut
nothing
off
but
the
ear
,
and
carry
it
away
in
a
great
basket
which
I
have
make
,
and
so
rub
it
out
with
my
hand
:
and
at
the
end
of
all
my
harvesting
I
find
,
that
out
of
my
half
-
peck
of
seed
I
have
near
two
bushel
of
rice
,
and
above
two
bushel
and
a
half
of
barley
,
that
be
to
say
,
by
my
guess
,
for
I
have
no
measure
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
a
great
encouragement
to
me
;
and
I
foresaw
,
that
in
time
it
would
please
God
to
supply
me
with
bread
:
and
yet
here
I
be
perplex
again
;
for
I
neither
know
how
to
grind
or
make
meal
of
my
corn
,
or
indeed
how
to
clean
it
and
part
it
;
nor
,
if
make
into
meal
,
how
to
make
bread
of
it
;
and
if
how
to
make
it
,
yet
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
bake
it
.
<EOS>
these
thing
be
add
to
my
desire
of
have
a
good
quantity
for
store
,
and
to
secure
a
constant
supply
,
I
resolve
not
to
taste
any
of
this
crop
,
but
to
preserve
it
all
for
seed
against
the
next
season
,
and
in
the
meantime
to
employ
all
my
study
and
hour
of
work
to
accomplish
this
great
work
of
provide
myself
with
corn
and
bread
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
truly
say
,
that
I
now
work
for
my
bread
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
wonderful
,
and
what
I
believe
few
people
have
think
much
upon
;
viz
.
<EOS>
the
strange
multitude
of
little
thing
necessary
in
the
providing
,
produce
,
cure
,
dressing
,
make
,
and
finish
this
one
article
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
that
be
reduce
to
a
mere
state
of
nature
,
find
this
to
be
my
daily
discouragement
,
and
be
make
more
and
more
sensible
of
it
every
hour
,
even
after
I
get
the
first
handful
of
seed
corn
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
come
up
unexpectedly
,
and
indeed
to
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
have
no
plough
to
turn
the
earth
,
no
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
this
I
conquer
by
make
a
wooden
spade
,
as
I
observe
before
;
but
this
do
my
work
but
in
a
wooden
manner
;
and
though
it
cost
me
a
great
many
day
to
make
it
,
yet
,
for
want
of
iron
,
it
not
only
wear
out
the
sooner
,
but
make
my
work
the
harder
,
and
make
it
be
perform
much
bad
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
this
I
bear
with
too
,
and
be
content
to
work
it
out
with
patience
,
and
bear
with
the
badness
of
the
performance
.
<EOS>
when
the
corn
be
sow
,
I
have
no
harrow
,
but
be
force
to
go
over
it
myself
,
and
drag
a
great
heavy
bough
of
a
tree
over
it
,
to
scratch
the
earth
,
as
it
may
be
call
,
rather
than
rake
or
harrow
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
be
grow
or
grow
,
I
have
observe
already
how
many
thing
I
want
,
to
fence
it
,
secure
it
,
mow
or
reap
it
,
cure
or
carry
it
home
,
thresh
,
part
it
from
the
chaff
,
and
save
it
.
<EOS>
then
I
want
a
mill
to
grind
it
,
sieve
to
dress
it
,
yeast
and
salt
to
make
it
into
bread
,
and
an
oven
to
bake
it
in
;
and
all
these
thing
I
do
without
,
as
shall
be
observe
;
and
yet
the
corn
be
an
inestimable
comfort
and
advantage
to
me
too
;
but
all
this
,
as
I
say
,
make
every
thing
laborious
and
tedious
to
me
,
but
that
there
be
no
help
for
;
<EOS>
neither
be
my
time
so
much
loss
to
me
,
because
I
have
divide
it
;
a
certain
part
of
it
be
every
day
appoint
to
these
work
;
and
<EOS>
as
I
resolve
to
use
none
of
the
corn
for
bread
till
I
have
a
great
quantity
by
me
,
I
have
the
next
six
month
to
apply
myself
wholly
by
labour
and
invention
,
to
furnish
myself
with
utensil
proper
for
the
perform
all
the
operation
necessary
for
the
make
the
corn
,
when
I
have
it
,
fit
for
my
use
.
  
<EOS>
but
first
I
be
to
prepare
more
land
,
for
I
have
now
seed
enough
to
sow
above
an
acre
of
ground
.
<EOS>
before
I
do
this
,
I
have
a
week
's
work
at
least
to
make
me
a
spade
,
which
,
when
it
be
do
,
be
a
very
sorry
one
indeed
,
and
very
heavy
,
and
require
double
labour
to
work
with
it
;
however
,
I
go
through
that
,
and
sow
my
seed
in
two
large
flat
piece
of
ground
,
as
near
my
house
as
I
could
find
them
to
my
mind
,
and
fence
them
in
with
a
good
hedge
,
the
stake
of
which
be
all
cut
off
that
wood
which
I
have
set
before
,
which
I
know
would
grow
;
so
that
in
one
year
's
time
I
know
I
should
have
a
quick
or
living
hedge
<EOS>
,
that
would
want
but
<EOS>
little
repair
.
<EOS>
this
work
be
not
so
little
as
to
take
me
up
less
than
three
month
;
because
great
part
of
that
time
be
in
the
wet
season
,
when
I
could
not
go
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
within
-
door
,
that
is
,
when
it
rain
,
and
I
could
not
go
out
,
I
find
employment
on
the
follow
occasion
,
always
observe
,
that
all
the
while
I
be
at
work
,
I
divert
myself
with
talk
to
my
parrot
,
and
teach
him
to
speak
;
and
I
quickly
learn
him
to
know
his
own
name
;
at
last
,
to
speak
it
out
pretty
loud
,
Pol
;
which
be
the
first
word
I
ever
hear
speak
in
the
island
by
any
mouth
but
my
own
.
<EOS>
this
therefore
be
not
my
work
,
but
an
assistant
to
my
work
;
for
now
,
as
I
say
,
I
have
a
great
employment
upon
my
hand
,
as
follow
:
viz
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
study
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
to
make
myself
some
earthen
vessel
,
which
indeed
I
want
sorely
,
but
know
not
where
to
come
at
them
:
however
,
consider
the
heat
of
the
climate
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
could
find
out
any
such
clay
,
I
may
botch
up
some
such
pot
as
might
,
be
dry
by
the
sun
,
be
hard
enough
and
strong
enough
to
bear
handling
,
and
to
hold
any
thing
that
be
dry
,
and
require
to
be
keep
so
;
and
as
this
be
necessary
in
prepare
corn
,
meal
,
&
c.
which
be
the
thing
I
be
upon
,
I
resolve
to
make
some
as
large
as
I
could
,
and
fit
only
to
stand
like
jar
to
hold
what
should
be
put
into
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
make
the
reader
pity
me
,
or
rather
laugh
at
me
,
to
tell
how
many
awkward
way
I
look
to
raise
this
paste
,
what
odd
misshapen
ugly
thing
I
make
,
how
many
of
them
fall
in
,
and
how
many
fall
out
,
the
clay
not
be
stiff
enough
to
bear
its
own
weight
;
how
many
crack
by
the
over
-
violent
heat
of
the
sun
,
be
set
out
too
hastily
;
and
how
many
fall
to
piece
with
only
remove
,
as
well
before
as
after
they
be
dry
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
how
,
after
have
labour
hard
to
find
the
clay
,
to
dig
it
,
to
temper
it
,
to
bring
it
home
,
and
work
it
,
I
could
not
make
above
two
large
earthen
ugly
thing
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
call
them
jar
,
in
about
two
month
labour
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
sun
bake
these
two
very
dry
and
hard
,
I
lift
them
very
gently
up
and
set
them
down
again
in
two
great
wicker
-
basket
,
which
I
have
make
on
purpose
for
them
that
they
may
not
break
;
and
,
as
between
the
pot
and
the
basket
there
be
a
little
room
to
spare
<EOS>
,
I
stuff
it
full
of
the
rice
and
barley
-
straw
;
and
these
two
pot
be
to
stand
always
dry
,
I
think
would
hold
my
dry
corn
,
and
perhaps
the
meal
when
the
corn
be
bruise
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
miscarry
so
much
in
my
design
for
large
pot
,
yet
I
make
several
small
thing
with
well
success
;
such
as
little
round
pot
,
flat
dish
,
pitcher
,
and
pipkin
,
and
any
thing
my
hand
turn
to
;
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
bake
them
strangely
hard
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
would
not
answer
my
end
,
which
be
to
get
an
earthen
pot
to
hold
what
be
liquid
,
and
bear
the
fire
,
which
none
of
these
could
do
.
<EOS>
It
happen
after
some
time
,
make
a
pretty
large
fire
for
cook
my
meat
,
when
I
go
to
put
it
out
,
after
I
have
do
with
it
<EOS>
,
I
find
a
broken
piece
of
one
of
my
earthenware
vessel
in
the
fire
,
burn
as
hard
as
a
stone
,
and
red
as
a
tile
.
<EOS>
I
be
agreeably
surprised
to
see
it
,
and
say
to
myself
,
that
certainly
they
may
be
make
to
burn
whole
,
if
they
would
burn
break
.
  
<EOS>
this
set
me
to
study
how
to
order
my
fire
,
so
as
to
make
it
burn
me
some
pot
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
notion
of
a
kiln
such
as
the
potter
burn
in
,
or
of
glaze
them
with
lead
,
though
I
have
some
lead
to
do
it
with
;
but
I
place
three
large
pipkin
,
and
two
or
three
pot
,
in
a
pile
one
upon
another
,
and
place
my
fire
-
wood
all
round
it
with
a
great
heap
of
ember
under
them
:
<EOS>
I
pile
the
fire
with
fresh
fuel
round
the
outside
,
and
upon
the
top
,
till
I
see
the
pot
in
the
inside
red
-
hot
quite
through
,
and
observe
that
they
do
not
crack
at
all
:
<EOS>
when
I
see
them
clear
red
,
I
let
them
stand
in
that
heat
about
five
or
six
hour
,
till
I
find
one
of
them
,
though
it
do
not
crack
,
do
melt
or
run
;
for
the
sand
which
be
mix
with
the
clay
melt
by
the
violence
of
the
heat
,
and
would
have
run
into
glass
,
if
I
have
go
on
;
so
I
slack
my
fire
gradually
,
till
the
pot
begin
to
abate
of
the
red
colour
;
and
watch
them
all
night
that
I
may
not
let
the
fire
abate
too
fast
,
in
the
morning
I
have
three
very
good
,
I
will
not
say
handsome
pipkin
,
and
two
other
earthen
pot
,
as
hard
burn
as
could
be
desire
;
and
one
of
them
perfectly
glaze
with
the
running
of
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
experiment
I
need
not
say
that
I
want
no
sort
of
earthenware
for
my
use
;
but
I
must
needs
say
,
as
to
the
shape
of
them
,
they
be
very
indifferent
,
as
any
one
may
suppose
,
when
I
have
no
way
of
make
them
,
but
as
the
child
make
dirt
-
pie
,
or
as
a
woman
would
make
pie
that
never
learn
to
raise
paste
.
  
<EOS>
no
joy
at
a
thing
of
so
mean
a
nature
be
ever
equal
to
mine
,
when
I
find
I
have
make
an
earthen
pot
that
would
bear
the
fire
;
and
I
have
hardly
patience
to
stay
till
they
be
cold
,
before
I
set
one
upon
the
fire
again
with
some
water
in
it
,
to
boil
me
some
meat
,
which
I
do
admirably
well
;
and
with
a
piece
of
a
kid
I
make
some
very
good
broth
,
though
I
want
oatmeal
,
and
several
other
ingredient
requisite
to
make
it
so
good
as
I
would
have
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
concern
be
to
get
me
a
stone
mortar
to
stamp
or
beat
some
corn
in
;
for
as
to
the
mill
,
there
be
no
thought
of
arrive
to
that
perfection
of
art
with
one
pair
of
hand
.
<EOS>
to
supply
this
want
,
I
be
at
a
great
loss
;
for
of
all
trade
in
the
world
I
be
as
perfectly
unqualified
for
a
stone
-
cutter
,
as
for
any
whatever
;
neither
have
I
any
tool
to
go
about
it
with
.
<EOS>
I
spend
many
a
day
to
find
out
a
great
stone
big
enough
to
cut
hollow
,
and
make
fit
for
a
mortar
,
and
could
find
none
at
all
except
what
be
in
the
solid
rock
,
and
which
I
have
no
way
to
dig
or
cut
out
;
nor
indeed
be
the
rock
in
the
island
of
hardness
sufficient
,
but
be
all
of
a
sandy
crumble
stone
,
which
would
neither
bear
the
weight
of
an
heavy
pestle
,
nor
would
break
the
corn
without
fill
it
with
sand
;
so
,
after
a
great
deal
of
time
lose
in
search
for
a
stone
,
I
give
it
over
,
and
resolve
to
look
out
a
great
block
of
hard
wood
,
which
I
find
indeed
much
easy
;
and
get
one
as
big
as
I
have
strength
to
stir
,
I
round
it
,
and
form
it
on
the
outside
with
my
axe
and
hatchet
;
and
then
with
the
help
of
fire
and
infinite
labour
,
make
an
hollow
place
in
it
,
as
the
Indians
in
Brasil
make
their
canoe
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
make
a
great
heavy
pestle
or
beater
of
the
wood
call
the
iron
-
wood
,
and
this
I
prepare
and
lay
by
against
<EOS>
I
have
my
next
crop
of
corn
,
when
I
propose
to
myself
to
grind
,
or
rather
pound
,
my
corn
or
meal
to
make
my
bread
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
difficulty
be
to
make
a
sieve
or
searce
,
to
dress
my
meal
,
and
part
it
from
the
bran
and
the
husk
,
without
which
I
do
not
see
it
possible
<EOS>
I
could
have
any
bread
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
difficult
thing
,
so
much
as
but
to
think
on
;
for
to
be
sure
I
have
nothing
like
the
necessary
thing
to
make
it
with
;
I
mean
fine
thin
canvass
,
or
stuff
,
to
searce
the
meal
through
.
<EOS>
and
here
I
be
at
a
full
stop
for
many
month
;
nor
do
I
really
know
what
to
do
:
linen
<EOS>
I
have
none
leave
but
what
be
mere
rag
;
I
have
goat
's
hair
,
but
neither
know
I
how
to
weave
or
spin
it
;
and
have
I
know
how
,
here
be
no
tool
to
work
it
with
.
<EOS>
all
the
remedy
that
I
find
for
this
,
be
,
that
at
last
I
do
remember
I
have
among
the
seaman
's
clothe
which
be
save
out
of
the
ship
,
some
neckcloth
of
calico
or
muslin
;
and
with
some
piece
of
these
I
make
three
small
sieve
,
but
proper
enough
for
the
work
;
and
thus
I
make
shift
for
some
year
;
how
I
do
afterwards
,
I
shall
shew
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
bake
part
be
the
next
thing
to
be
consider
,
and
how
I
should
make
bread
when
I
come
to
have
corn
;
for
,
first
,
I
have
no
yeast
:
<EOS>
as
to
that
part
,
there
be
no
supply
the
want
,
so
I
do
not
concern
myself
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
for
an
oven
,
I
be
indeed
in
great
pain
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
find
out
an
experiment
for
that
also
,
which
be
this
;
I
make
some
earthen
vessel
very
broad
,
but
not
deep
;
that
be
to
say
,
about
two
foot
diameter
,
and
not
above
nine
inch
deep
;
these
I
burn
in
the
fire
,
as
I
have
do
the
other
,
and
lay
them
by
;
and
when
I
want
to
bake
,
I
make
a
great
fire
upon
the
hearth
,
which
I
have
pave
with
some
square
tile
of
my
own
making
and
burn
also
;
but
I
should
not
call
them
square
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
fire
-
wood
be
burn
pretty
much
into
ember
,
or
live
coal
,
I
draw
them
forward
upon
this
hearth
,
so
as
to
cover
it
all
over
;
and
there
I
let
them
lie
,
till
the
hearth
be
very
hot
;
then
sweep
away
all
the
ember
,
I
set
down
my
loaf
,
or
loaf
;
and
whelm
down
the
earthen
pot
upon
them
,
draw
the
ember
all
round
the
outside
of
the
pot
,
to
keep
in
,
and
add
to
the
heat
;
and
thus
,
as
well
as
in
the
good
oven
in
the
world
,
I
bake
my
barley
-
loaf
,
and
become
in
a
little
time
a
mere
pastry
-
cook
into
the
bargain
;
for
I
make
myself
several
cake
of
the
rice
,
and
pudding
;
indeed
I
make
no
pie
,
neither
have
I
any
thing
to
put
into
them
,
suppose
I
have
,
except
the
flesh
either
of
fowl
or
goat
.
  
<EOS>
It
nee
not
be
wonder
at
,
if
all
these
thing
take
me
up
most
part
of
the
third
year
of
my
abode
here
;
for
it
be
to
be
observe
,
that
in
the
interval
of
these
thing
I
have
<EOS>
my
new
harvest
and
husbandry
to
manage
:
for
I
reap
my
corn
in
its
season
,
and
carry
it
home
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
lay
it
up
in
the
ear
,
in
my
large
basket
,
till
I
have
time
to
rub
it
out
;
for
I
have
no
floor
to
thresh
it
on
,
or
instrument
to
thresh
it
with
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
indeed
my
stock
of
corn
increasing
,
I
really
want
to
build
my
barn
big
<EOS>
:
I
want
a
place
to
lay
it
up
in
;
for
the
increase
of
the
corn
now
yield
me
so
much
,
that
I
have
of
the
barley
about
twenty
bushel
,
and
of
the
rice
as
much
,
or
more
;
insomuch
that
I
now
resolve
to
begin
to
use
it
freely
,
for
my
bread
have
be
quite
go
a
great
while
;
also
I
resolve
to
see
what
quantity
would
be
sufficient
for
me
a
whole
year
,
and
to
sow
but
once
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
find
that
the
forty
bushel
of
barley
and
rice
be
much
more
than
I
could
consume
in
a
year
:
so
I
resolve
to
sow
just
the
same
quantity
every
year
that
I
sow
the
last
,
in
hope
that
such
a
quantity
would
fully
provide
me
with
bread
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
all
the
while
these
thing
be
do
,
you
may
be
sure
my
thought
run
many
time
upon
the
prospect
of
land
which
I
have
see
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
;
and
I
be
not
without
secret
wish
,
that
I
be
on
shore
there
,
fancy
that
see
the
main
land
,
and
an
inhabit
country
,
I
may
find
some
way
or
other
to
convey
myself
farther
,
and
perhaps
at
last
find
some
mean
of
escape
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
while
I
make
no
allowance
for
the
danger
of
such
a
condition
,
and
how
I
may
fall
into
the
hand
of
savage
,
and
perhaps
such
as
I
may
have
reason
to
think
far
bad
than
the
lion
and
tiger
of
Africa
:
that
if
I
once
come
into
their
power
,
I
should
run
an
hazard
more
than
a
thousand
to
one
of
be
kill
,
and
perhaps
of
be
eat
;
for
I
have
hear
that
the
people
of
the
caribean
coast
be
cannibal
,
or
man
-
eater
;
and
I
know
by
the
latitude
that
I
could
not
be
far
off
from
that
shore
:
that
,
suppose
they
be
not
cannibal
,
yet
they
may
kill
me
,
as
many
Europeans
who
have
fall
into
their
hand
have
be
serve
,
even
when
they
have
be
ten
or
twenty
together
;
much
more
I
that
be
but
one
,
and
could
make
little
or
no
defence
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
,
I
say
,
which
I
ought
to
have
consider
well
of
,
and
I
do
cast
up
in
my
thought
afterwards
,
yet
take
none
of
my
apprehension
at
first
;
and
my
head
run
mightily
upon
the
thought
of
get
over
to
that
shore
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
wish
for
my
boy
Xury
,
and
the
long
-
boat
,
with
the
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
,
with
which
I
sail
above
a
thousand
mile
on
the
coast
of
Africa
;
but
this
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
then
I
think
I
would
go
and
look
on
our
ship
's
boat
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
blow
up
upon
the
shore
a
great
way
in
the
storm
,
when
we
be
first
cast
away
.
<EOS>
She
lie
almost
where
she
do
at
first
,
but
not
quite
;
and
be
turn
by
the
force
of
the
wave
and
the
wind
almost
bottom
upwards
,
against
the
high
ridge
of
a
beachy
rough
sand
,
but
no
water
about
her
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
have
hand
to
have
refit
her
,
and
have
launch
her
into
the
water
,
the
boat
would
have
do
well
enough
,
and
I
may
have
go
back
into
the
Brasils
with
her
easy
enough
;
but
I
may
have
easily
foresee
,
that
I
could
no
more
turn
her
,
and
set
her
upright
upon
her
bottom
,
than
I
could
remove
the
island
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
to
the
wood
,
and
cut
lever
and
roller
,
and
bring
them
to
the
boat
,
resolve
to
try
what
I
could
do
;
suggest
to
myself
,
that
if
I
could
but
turn
her
down
<EOS>
,
I
may
easily
repair
the
damage
she
have
receive
,
and
she
would
be
a
very
good
boat
,
and
I
may
go
to
sea
in
her
very
easily
.
  
<EOS>
I
spare
no
pain
indeed
in
this
piece
of
fruitless
toil
,
and
spend
,
I
think
,
three
or
four
week
about
it
;
at
last
find
it
impossible
to
heave
it
up
with
my
little
strength
,
I
fall
to
dig
away
the
sand
to
undermine
it
;
and
so
to
make
it
fall
down
,
set
piece
of
wood
to
thrust
and
guide
it
right
in
the
fall
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
do
this
,
I
be
unable
to
stir
it
up
again
,
or
to
get
under
it
,
much
less
to
move
it
forwards
towards
the
water
;
so
I
be
force
to
give
it
over
:
and
yet
,
though
I
give
over
the
hope
of
the
boat
,
my
desire
to
venture
over
for
the
main
increase
,
rather
than
decrease
,
as
the
mean
for
it
seem
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
this
at
length
set
me
upon
think
whether
it
be
not
possible
to
make
myself
a
canoe
or
periagua
,
such
as
the
native
of
those
climate
make
,
even
without
tool
,
or
,
as
I
may
say
,
without
hand
,
viz
.
<EOS>
of
the
trunk
of
a
great
tree
.
<EOS>
this
I
not
only
think
possible
,
but
easy
:
and
please
myself
extremely
with
my
thought
of
make
it
,
and
with
my
have
much
more
convenience
for
it
than
any
of
the
Negroes
or
Indians
;
but
not
at
all
consider
the
particular
inconvenience
which
I
lie
under
more
than
the
Indians
do
,
viz
.
<EOS>
want
of
hand
to
move
it
into
the
water
,
when
it
be
make
;
a
difficulty
much
harder
for
me
to
surmount
than
<EOS>
all
the
consequence
of
want
of
tool
could
be
to
them
:
for
what
be
it
to
me
,
<EOS>
that
when
I
have
choose
a
vast
tree
in
the
wood
,
I
may
with
great
trouble
cut
it
down
,
if
after
I
may
be
able
with
my
tool
to
hew
and
dub
the
outside
into
a
proper
shape
of
a
boat
,
and
burn
or
cut
out
the
inside
to
make
it
hollow
,
so
to
make
a
boat
of
it
,
if
,
after
all
this
,
I
must
leave
it
just
there
where
I
find
it
,
and
be
not
able
to
launch
it
into
the
water
?
  
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
I
could
not
have
have
the
least
reflection
upon
my
mind
of
this
circumstance
,
while
I
be
make
this
boat
,
but
I
should
have
immediately
think
how
I
should
get
it
into
the
sea
;
but
my
thought
be
so
intent
upon
my
voyage
over
the
sea
in
it
,
that
I
never
once
consider
how
I
should
get
it
off
the
land
;
and
it
be
really
in
its
own
nature
more
easy
for
me
to
guide
it
over
forty
-
five
mile
of
sea
,
than
about
forty
-
five
fathom
of
land
,
where
it
lie
,
to
set
it
afloat
in
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
work
upon
this
boat
the
most
like
a
fool
that
ever
man
do
,
who
have
any
of
his
sense
awake
.
<EOS>
I
please
myself
with
the
design
,
without
determine
whether
I
be
ever
able
to
undertake
it
;
not
but
that
the
difficulty
of
launch
my
boat
come
often
into
my
head
;
but
I
put
a
stop
to
my
own
inquiry
into
it
by
this
foolish
answer
,
which
I
give
myself
;
let
me
first
make
it
,
I
will
warrant
I
will
find
some
way
or
other
to
get
it
along
,
when
it
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
preposterous
method
;
but
the
eagerness
of
my
fancy
prevailed
,
and
to
work
I
go
,
and
fell
a
cedar
-
tree
:
I
question
much
whether
Solomon
ever
have
such
an
one
for
the
building
the
temple
at
Jerusalem
;
it
be
five
foot
ten
inch
diameter
at
the
low
part
next
the
stump
,
and
<EOS>
four
foot
eleven
inch
diameter
at
the
end
of
twenty
-
two
foot
,
after
which
it
lessen
for
a
while
,
and
then
part
into
branch
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
infinite
labour
that
I
fell
this
tree
:
I
be
twenty
day
hack
and
hew
at
it
at
the
bottom
;
I
be
fourteen
more
get
the
branch
and
limb
,
and
the
vast
spread
head
of
it
,
cut
off
,
which
I
hack
and
hew
through
with
my
axe
and
hatchet
,
with
inexpressible
labour
:
<EOS>
after
this
it
cost
me
a
month
to
shape
it
,
and
dub
it
to
a
proportion
,
and
to
something
like
the
bottom
of
a
boat
,
that
it
may
swim
upright
as
it
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
cost
me
near
three
month
more
to
clear
the
inside
,
and
work
it
out
so
as
to
make
an
exact
boat
of
it
:
this
I
do
indeed
without
fire
,
by
mere
mallet
and
chissel
,
and
by
the
dint
of
hard
labour
;
till
I
have
bring
it
to
be
a
very
handsome
periagua
,
and
big
enough
to
have
carry
six
-
and
-
twenty
man
,
and
consequently
big
enough
to
have
carry
me
and
all
my
cargo
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
go
through
this
work
,
I
be
extremely
delighted
with
it
:
the
boat
be
really
much
big
than
I
ever
see
a
canoe
or
periagua
,
that
be
make
of
one
tree
,
in
my
life
;
many
a
weary
stroke
it
have
cost
,
you
may
be
sure
,
for
there
remain
nothing
but
to
get
it
into
the
water
;
and
have
I
get
it
into
the
water
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
question
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
begin
the
maddest
voyage
,
and
the
most
unlikely
to
be
perform
,
that
ever
be
undertake
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
my
device
to
get
it
into
the
water
fail
me
,
though
they
cost
infinite
labour
too
;
it
lie
about
one
hundred
yard
from
the
water
,
and
not
more
;
but
the
first
inconvenience
be
,
it
be
up
hill
towards
the
creek
.
<EOS>
well
,
to
take
away
this
discouragement
,
I
resolve
to
dig
into
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
and
so
make
a
declivity
;
this
I
begin
,
and
it
cost
me
a
prodigious
deal
of
pain
:
but
who
grudge
pain
,
that
have
their
deliverance
in
view
?
<EOS>
but
when
this
be
work
through
,
and
this
difficulty
manage
,
it
be
still
much
at
one
;
for
I
could
no
more
stir
the
canoe
,
than
I
could
the
other
boat
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
measure
the
distance
of
ground
,
and
resolve
to
cut
a
dock
,
or
canal
,
to
bring
the
water
up
to
the
canoe
,
see
I
could
not
bring
the
canoe
down
to
the
water
:
<EOS>
well
,
I
begin
this
work
,
and
when
I
begin
to
enter
into
it
,
and
calculate
how
deep
it
be
to
be
dig
,
<EOS>
how
broad
,
how
the
stuff
to
be
throw
out
,
I
find
,
that
by
the
number
of
hand
I
have
,
be
none
but
<EOS>
my
own
,
it
must
have
be
ten
or
twelve
year
before
I
should
have
go
through
with
it
;
for
the
shore
lie
high
,
so
that
at
the
upper
end
it
must
have
be
at
least
twenty
foot
deep
:
so
at
length
,
though
with
great
reluctancy
,
I
give
this
attempt
over
also
.
  
<EOS>
this
grieve
me
heartily
;
and
now
I
see
,
though
too
late
,
the
folly
of
begin
a
work
before
we
count
the
cost
,
and
before
we
judge
lightly
of
our
own
strength
to
go
through
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
this
work
I
finish
my
fourth
year
in
this
place
,
and
keep
my
anniversary
with
the
same
devotion
,
and
with
as
much
comfort
,
as
ever
before
;
for
by
a
constant
study
,
and
serious
application
of
the
word
of
God
,
and
by
the
assistance
of
his
grace
,
I
gain
a
different
knowledge
from
what
I
have
before
;
I
entertain
different
notion
of
thing
;
I
look
now
upon
the
world
as
a
thing
remote
;
which
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
,
no
expectation
from
,
and
indeed
no
desire
about
:
in
a
word
,
I
have
nothing
indeed
to
do
with
it
,
nor
be
ever
like
to
have
;
so
I
think
it
look
as
we
may
perhaps
look
upon
it
hereafter
;
viz
.
<EOS>
as
a
place
I
have
live
in
,
but
be
come
out
of
it
;
and
well
I
may
say
,
as
father
Abraham
to
Dives
,
"
between
me
and
thee
there
be
a
great
gulf
fix
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
be
remove
from
all
the
wickedness
of
the
world
here
:
I
have
neither
the
lust
of
the
flesh
,
the
lust
of
the
eye
,
or
the
pride
of
life
:
I
have
nothing
to
covet
,
for
I
have
all
I
be
now
capable
of
enjoy
;
I
be
lord
of
the
whole
manor
,
or
,
if
I
please
,
I
may
call
myself
king
or
emperor
over
the
whole
country
which
I
have
possession
of
:
<EOS>
there
be
no
rival
<EOS>
:
I
have
no
competitor
,
none
to
dispute
sovereignty
or
command
with
me
;
I
may
have
raise
ship
-
loading
of
corn
,
but
I
have
no
use
for
it
;
so
I
let
as
little
grow
as
I
think
enough
for
my
occasion
<EOS>
:
I
have
tortoise
or
turtle
enough
;
but
now
and
then
one
be
as
much
as
I
could
put
to
any
use
<EOS>
:
I
have
timber
enough
to
have
build
a
fleet
of
ship
;
I
have
grape
enough
to
have
make
wine
,
or
to
have
cure
into
raisin
,
to
have
load
that
fleet
when
they
have
be
build
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
I
could
make
use
of
,
be
all
that
be
valuable
:
<EOS>
I
have
enough
to
eat
,
and
to
supply
my
want
,
and
what
be
all
the
rest
to
me
?
<EOS>
if
I
kill
more
flesh
than
I
could
eat
,
the
dog
must
eat
it
,
or
the
vermin
;
if
I
sow
more
corn
than
I
could
eat
,
it
must
be
spoil
.
<EOS>
the
tree
that
I
cut
down
be
lie
to
rot
on
the
ground
,
I
could
make
no
more
use
of
them
,
than
for
fuel
;
and
that
I
have
no
occasion
for
,
but
to
dress
my
food
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
nature
and
experience
of
thing
dictate
to
me
upon
just
reflection
,
that
all
the
good
thing
of
this
world
be
no
farther
good
to
us
,
than
as
they
be
for
our
use
:
and
that
whatever
we
may
heap
up
indeed
to
give
to
other
,
we
enjoy
as
much
as
we
can
use
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
most
covetous
griping
miser
in
the
world
would
have
be
cure
of
the
vice
of
covetousness
,
if
he
have
be
in
my
case
;
for
I
possess
infinitely
more
than
I
know
what
to
do
with
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
room
for
desire
,
except
it
be
of
thing
which
I
have
not
,
and
they
be
but
trifle
,
though
indeed
of
great
use
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
as
I
hint
before
,
a
parcel
of
money
,
as
well
gold
as
silver
,
about
thirty
-
six
pound
sterling
;
alas
!
<EOS>
there
the
nasty
,
sorry
,
useless
stuff
lay
;
I
have
no
manner
of
business
for
it
;
and
I
often
think
with
myself
,
that
I
would
have
give
an
handful
of
it
for
a
gross
of
tobacco
-
pipe
,
or
for
an
hand
-
mill
to
grind
my
corn
;
nay
,
I
would
have
give
it
all
for
six
-
penny
-
worth
of
turnip
and
carrot
seed
out
of
England
,
or
for
an
handful
of
pea
and
bean
,
and
a
bottle
of
ink
:
as
it
be
,
I
have
not
the
least
advantage
by
it
,
or
benefit
from
it
;
but
there
it
lie
in
a
drawer
,
and
grow
mouldy
with
the
damp
of
the
cave
,
in
the
wet
season
;
and
if
I
have
have
the
drawer
full
of
diamond
,
it
have
be
the
same
case
;
and
they
have
be
of
no
manner
of
value
to
me
,
because
of
no
use
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
bring
my
state
of
life
to
be
much
easy
in
itself
than
it
be
at
first
,
and
much
easy
to
my
mind
,
as
well
as
to
my
body
.
<EOS>
I
frequently
sit
down
to
my
meat
with
thankfulness
,
and
admire
the
hand
of
God
's
providence
,
which
have
thus
spread
my
table
in
the
wilderness
:
<EOS>
I
learn
to
look
more
upon
the
bright
side
of
my
condition
,
and
less
upon
the
dark
side
;
and
to
consider
what
I
enjoy
,
rather
than
what
I
want
;
and
this
give
me
sometimes
such
secret
comfort
,
that
I
can
not
express
them
;
and
which
I
take
notice
of
here
,
to
put
those
discontent
people
in
mind
of
it
,
who
can
not
enjoy
comfortably
what
God
hath
give
them
,
because
they
see
and
covet
something
that
he
have
not
give
them
:
all
our
discontent
about
what
we
want
,
appear
to
me
to
spring
from
the
want
of
thankfulness
for
what
we
have
.
  
<EOS>
another
reflection
be
of
great
use
to
me
,
and
doubtless
would
be
so
to
any
one
that
should
fall
into
such
distress
as
mine
be
;
and
this
be
,
to
compare
my
present
condition
with
what
I
at
first
expect
it
should
be
;
nay
,
with
what
it
would
certainly
have
be
,
if
the
good
providence
of
God
have
not
wonderfully
order
the
ship
to
be
cast
up
near
to
the
shore
,
where
I
not
only
could
come
at
her
,
but
could
bring
what
I
get
out
of
her
to
the
shore
for
my
relief
and
comfort
;
without
which
I
have
want
tool
to
work
,
weapon
for
defence
,
or
gunpowder
and
shoot
for
get
my
food
.
  
<EOS>
I
spend
whole
hour
,
I
may
say
whole
day
,
in
represent
to
myself
in
the
most
lively
colour
,
how
I
must
have
act
,
if
I
have
get
nothing
out
of
the
ship
;
how
I
could
not
have
so
much
as
get
any
food
,
except
fish
and
turtle
;
and
that
,
as
it
be
long
before
I
find
any
of
them
,
I
must
have
perish
first
:
that
I
should
have
live
,
if
I
have
not
perish
,
like
a
mere
savage
:
<EOS>
that
if
I
have
kill
a
goat
or
a
fowl
by
any
contrivance
,
I
have
no
way
to
flay
or
open
them
,
or
part
the
flesh
from
the
skin
and
the
bowel
,
or
to
cut
it
up
;
but
must
gnaw
it
with
my
tooth
,
and
pull
it
with
my
claws
,
like
a
beast
.
  
<EOS>
these
reflection
make
me
very
sensible
of
the
goodness
of
Providence
to
me
,
and
very
thankful
for
my
present
condition
,
with
all
its
hardship
and
misfortune
:
and
this
part
also
I
can
not
but
recommend
to
the
reflection
of
those
who
be
apt
in
their
misery
to
say
,
be
any
affliction
like
mine
?
<EOS>
let
them
consider
,
how
much
bad
the
case
of
some
people
be
,
and
what
their
case
may
have
be
,
if
Providence
have
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
another
reflection
which
assist
me
also
to
comfort
my
mind
with
hope
;
and
this
be
,
compare
my
present
condition
with
what
I
have
deserve
,
and
have
therefore
reason
to
expect
from
the
hand
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
I
have
live
a
dreadful
life
,
perfectly
destitute
of
the
knowledge
and
fear
of
God
:
I
have
be
well
instruct
by
father
and
mother
;
neither
have
they
be
want
to
me
in
their
early
endeavour
to
infuse
a
religious
awe
of
God
into
my
mind
,
a
sense
of
my
duty
,
and
of
what
the
nature
and
end
of
my
be
require
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
fall
early
into
the
seafare
life
,
which
of
all
the
life
be
the
most
destitute
of
the
fear
of
God
,
though
his
terror
be
always
before
them
;
I
say
,
fall
early
into
the
seafare
life
,
and
into
seafare
company
,
all
that
little
sense
of
religion
which
I
have
entertain
,
be
laugh
out
of
me
by
my
messmate
;
by
an
harden
despising
of
danger
,
and
the
view
of
death
,
which
grow
habitual
to
me
;
by
my
long
absence
from
all
manner
of
opportunity
to
converse
with
any
thing
<EOS>
but
what
be
like
myself
,
or
to
hear
any
thing
of
what
be
good
,
or
tend
towards
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
void
be
I
of
every
thing
that
be
good
,
or
of
the
least
sense
of
what
I
be
,
or
be
to
be
,
that
in
the
great
deliverance
I
enjoy
,
such
as
my
escape
from
Sallee
,
my
be
take
up
by
the
portuguese
master
of
the
ship
,
my
being
plant
so
well
in
Brasil
,
my
receive
the
cargo
from
England
,
and
the
like
,
I
never
once
have
the
word
,
thank
God
,
<EOS>
so
much
as
on
my
mind
,
or
in
my
mouth
;
nor
in
the
great
distress
have
I
so
much
think
as
to
pray
to
him
;
nor
so
much
as
to
say
,
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
no
,
not
to
mention
the
name
of
God
,
unless
it
be
to
swear
by
,
and
blaspheme
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
terrible
reflection
upon
my
mind
for
many
month
,
as
I
have
already
observe
,
on
the
account
of
my
wicked
and
hardened
life
past
;
and
when
I
look
about
me
,
and
consider
what
particular
providence
have
attend
me
,
since
my
come
into
this
place
,
and
how
God
have
deal
bountifully
with
me
;
have
not
only
punish
me
less
than
my
iniquity
deserve
,
but
have
so
plentifully
provide
for
me
;
this
give
me
great
hope
that
my
repentance
be
accept
,
and
that
God
have
yet
mercy
in
store
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
reflection
I
work
my
mind
up
,
not
only
to
resignation
to
the
will
of
God
in
the
present
disposition
of
my
circumstance
,
but
even
to
a
sincere
thankfulness
of
my
condition
;
and
that
I
,
who
be
yet
a
live
man
,
ought
not
to
complain
,
see
I
have
not
the
due
punishment
of
my
sin
;
that
I
enjoy
so
many
mercy
,
which
I
have
no
reason
to
have
expect
in
that
place
,
that
I
ought
never
more
to
repine
at
my
condition
,
but
to
rejoice
,
and
to
give
daily
thank
,
for
that
daily
bread
,
which
nothing
but
a
cloud
of
wonder
could
have
bring
:
that
I
ought
to
consider
I
have
be
feed
even
by
a
miracle
,
even
as
great
as
that
of
feed
Elijah
by
raven
;
nay
,
by
a
long
series
of
miracle
;
and
that
I
could
hardly
have
name
a
place
in
the
uninhabited
part
of
the
world
,
where
I
could
have
be
cast
more
to
my
advantage
:
a
place
,
where
as
I
have
no
society
,
which
be
my
affliction
on
one
hand
,
so
I
find
no
ravenous
beast
,
no
furious
wolf
or
tiger
,
to
threaten
my
life
;
no
venomous
creature
,
or
poisonous
,
which
I
may
have
feed
on
to
my
hurt
;
no
savage
to
murder
and
devour
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
as
my
life
be
a
life
of
sorrow
one
way
,
so
it
be
a
life
of
mercy
another
;
and
I
want
nothing
to
make
it
a
life
of
comfort
,
but
to
be
able
to
make
my
sense
of
God
's
goodness
to
me
,
and
care
over
me
in
this
condition
,
be
my
daily
consolation
;
and
after
I
make
a
just
improvement
of
these
thing
,
I
go
away
,
and
be
no
more
sad
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
be
here
so
long
,
that
many
thing
which
I
bring
on
shore
for
my
help
,
be
either
quite
go
,
or
very
much
waste
,
and
near
spend
.
  
<EOS>
My
ink
,
as
I
observe
,
have
be
go
for
some
time
,
all
but
a
very
little
,
which
I
eke
out
with
water
a
little
and
a
little
,
till
it
be
so
pale
<EOS>
it
scarce
leave
any
appearance
of
black
upon
the
paper
:
as
long
as
it
last
,
I
make
use
of
it
to
minute
down
the
day
of
the
month
on
which
any
remarkable
thing
happen
to
me
;
and
first
,
by
cast
up
time
past
<EOS>
,
I
remember
that
there
be
a
strange
concurrence
of
day
,
in
the
various
providence
which
befel
me
,
and
which
,
if
I
have
be
superstitiously
incline
to
observe
day
as
fatal
or
fortunate
,
I
may
have
have
reason
to
have
look
upon
with
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
I
have
observe
,
that
the
same
day
that
I
break
away
from
my
father
and
my
friend
,
and
run
away
to
Hull
in
order
to
go
to
sea
,
the
same
day
afterwards
I
be
take
by
the
Sallee
man
of
war
,
and
make
a
slave
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
day
of
the
year
that
I
escape
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
in
Yarmouth
Roads
,
that
same
day
of
the
year
afterwards
I
make
my
escape
from
Sallee
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
day
of
the
year
I
be
bear
on
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
20th
of
September
,
the
same
day
I
have
my
life
so
miraculously
save
twenty
-
six
year
after
,
when
I
be
cast
on
shore
in
this
island
;
so
that
my
wicked
life
,
and
solitary
life
<EOS>
,
both
begin
on
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
thing
to
my
ink
's
be
waste
,
be
that
of
my
bread
,
I
mean
the
biscuit
which
I
bring
out
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
this
I
have
husband
to
the
last
degree
,
allow
myself
but
one
cake
of
bread
a
day
,
for
above
a
year
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
quite
without
bread
for
a
year
before
I
get
any
corn
of
my
own
:
and
great
reason
I
have
to
be
thankful
that
I
have
any
at
all
,
the
get
it
be
,
as
have
be
already
observe
,
next
to
miraculous
.
  
<EOS>
My
clothe
too
begin
to
decay
mightily
:
<EOS>
as
to
linen
,
I
have
none
a
good
while
,
except
some
chequer
shirt
which
I
find
in
the
chest
of
the
other
seaman
,
and
which
I
carefully
preserve
,
because
many
time
I
could
bear
no
other
clothe
on
but
a
shirt
;
and
it
be
a
very
great
help
to
me
,
that
I
have
among
all
the
man
's
clothe
of
the
ship
almost
three
dozen
of
shirt
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
several
thick
watch
-
coat
of
the
seaman
,
which
be
leave
behind
,
but
they
be
too
hot
to
wear
;
and
though
it
be
true
,
that
the
weather
be
so
violent
hot
,
that
there
be
no
need
of
clothe
,
yet
I
could
not
go
quite
naked
;
no
,
though
I
have
be
incline
to
it
,
which
I
be
not
;
nor
could
I
abide
the
thought
of
it
,
though
I
be
all
alone
.
  
<EOS>
one
reason
why
I
could
not
go
quite
naked
,
be
,
I
could
not
bear
the
heat
of
the
sun
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
when
quite
naked
as
with
some
clothe
on
;
nay
,
the
very
heat
frequently
blister
my
skin
;
whereas
,
with
a
shirt
on
,
the
air
itself
make
some
motion
,
and
whistle
under
the
shirt
,
be
twofold
cool
than
without
it
:
no
more
could
I
ever
bring
myself
to
go
out
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
without
a
cap
or
a
hat
;
the
heat
of
the
sun
beat
with
such
violence
as
it
do
in
that
place
,
would
give
me
the
headach
presently
,
by
dart
so
directly
on
my
head
,
without
a
cap
or
hat
on
,
so
that
I
could
not
bear
it
;
whereas
,
if
I
put
on
my
hat
,
it
would
presently
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
view
I
begin
to
consider
about
put
the
few
rag
I
have
,
which
I
call
clothe
,
into
some
order
;
I
have
wear
out
all
the
waistcoat
I
have
,
and
my
business
be
now
to
try
if
I
could
not
make
jacket
out
of
the
great
watch
-
coat
which
I
have
by
me
,
and
with
such
other
material
as
I
have
;
so
I
set
to
work
a
-
tailoring
,
or
rather
indeed
a
-
botching
;
for
I
make
most
piteous
work
of
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
make
shift
to
make
two
or
three
waistcoat
,
which
I
hope
would
serve
me
a
great
while
;
as
for
breech
or
drawer
,
I
make
but
very
sorry
shift
indeed
,
till
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
mention
that
I
save
the
skin
of
all
the
creature
that
I
kill
,
I
mean
four
-
foot
one
;
and
I
have
hang
them
up
stretch
out
with
stick
in
the
sun
;
by
which
mean
some
of
them
be
so
dry
and
hard
,
that
they
be
fit
for
little
;
but
other
,
it
seem
,
be
very
useful
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
make
of
these
be
a
great
cap
for
my
head
,
with
the
hair
on
the
outside
to
shoot
off
the
rain
;
and
this
I
perform
so
well
,
that
after
this
I
make
a
suit
of
clothe
wholly
of
those
skin
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
waistcoat
and
breech
open
at
the
knee
,
and
both
loose
;
for
they
be
rather
want
to
keep
me
cool
,
than
to
keep
me
warm
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
to
acknowledge
,
that
they
be
wretchedly
make
;
for
if
I
be
a
bad
carpenter
,
I
be
a
bad
tailor
;
however
,
they
be
such
as
I
make
a
very
good
shift
with
;
and
when
I
be
abroad
,
if
it
happen
to
rain
,
the
hair
of
the
waistcoat
and
cap
be
outmost
,
I
be
keep
very
dry
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
I
spend
a
deal
of
time
and
pain
to
make
me
an
umbrella
<EOS>
:
I
be
indeed
in
great
want
of
one
,
and
have
a
great
mind
to
make
one
:
I
have
see
them
make
in
the
Brasils
,
where
they
be
very
useful
in
the
great
heat
which
be
there
;
and
I
feel
the
heat
every
jot
as
great
here
,
and
great
too
,
be
nearer
the
equinox
;
besides
,
as
I
be
oblige
to
be
much
abroad
,
it
be
a
most
useful
thing
to
me
,
as
well
for
the
rain
as
the
heat
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
world
of
pain
at
it
,
and
be
a
great
while
before
I
could
make
any
thing
likely
to
hold
;
nay
,
after
I
think
I
have
hit
the
way
,
I
spoil
two
or
three
before
I
make
one
to
my
mind
;
but
at
last
I
make
one
that
answer
indifferently
well
.
<EOS>
the
main
difficulty
I
find
be
to
make
it
to
let
down
:
I
could
make
it
to
spread
;
but
if
it
do
not
let
down
too
,
and
draw
in
,
it
would
not
be
portable
for
me
any
way
,
but
just
over
my
head
,
which
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
,
as
I
say
,
I
make
one
to
answer
;
I
cover
it
with
skin
,
the
hair
upwards
,
so
that
it
cast
off
the
rain
like
a
penthouse
,
and
keep
off
the
sun
so
effectually
,
that
I
could
walk
out
in
the
hot
of
the
weather
,
with
great
advantage
than
I
could
before
in
the
cool
;
and
when
I
have
no
need
of
it
,
I
could
close
it
,
and
carry
it
under
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
thus
I
live
mighty
comfortably
,
my
mind
be
entirely
compose
by
resign
to
the
will
of
God
,
and
throw
myself
wholly
upon
the
disposal
of
his
providence
:
this
make
my
life
well
than
sociable
;
for
when
I
begin
to
regret
the
want
of
conversation
,
I
would
ask
myself
,
whether
thus
converse
mutually
with
my
own
thought
,
and
,
as
I
hope
I
may
say
,
with
even
my
maker
,
by
ejaculation
and
petition
,
be
not
well
than
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
human
society
in
the
world
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
that
after
this
,
for
five
year
,
any
extraordinary
thing
happen
to
me
;
but
I
live
on
in
the
same
course
,
in
the
same
posture
and
place
,
just
as
before
.
<EOS>
the
chief
thing
I
be
employ
in
,
besides
my
yearly
labour
of
plant
my
barley
and
rice
,
and
cure
my
raisin
,
of
both
which
I
always
keep
up
just
enough
to
have
sufficient
stock
of
the
year
's
provision
beforehand
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
besides
this
yearly
labour
,
and
my
daily
labour
of
go
out
with
my
gun
,
I
have
one
labour
to
make
me
a
canoe
,
which
at
last
I
finish
:
so
that
by
dig
a
canal
to
it
,
six
foot
wide
,
and
four
foot
deep
,
I
bring
it
into
the
creek
,
almost
half
a
mile
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
first
,
that
be
so
vastly
big
,
as
I
make
it
without
consider
beforehand
,
as
I
ought
to
do
,
how
I
should
be
able
to
launch
it
;
so
never
be
able
to
bring
it
to
the
water
,
or
bring
the
water
to
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
oblige
to
let
it
lie
where
it
be
,
as
a
memorandum
to
teach
me
to
be
wise
next
time
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
next
time
,
though
I
could
not
get
a
tree
proper
for
it
,
and
be
in
a
place
where
I
could
not
get
the
water
to
it
,
at
any
less
distance
than
,
as
I
have
say
,
of
near
half
a
mile
;
yet
as
I
see
it
be
practicable
at
last
,
I
never
give
it
over
;
and
though
I
be
near
two
year
about
it
,
yet
I
never
grudge
my
labour
,
in
hope
of
have
a
boat
to
go
off
to
sea
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
though
my
little
periagua
be
finish
,
yet
the
size
of
it
be
not
at
all
answerable
to
the
design
which
I
have
in
view
,
when
I
make
the
first
;
I
mean
of
venture
over
to
the
Terra
Firma
,
where
it
be
above
forty
mile
broad
;
accordingly
,
the
smallness
of
my
boat
assist
to
put
an
end
to
that
design
,
and
now
I
think
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
have
a
boat
,
my
next
design
be
to
make
a
tour
round
the
island
:
for
as
I
have
be
on
the
other
side
,
in
one
place
,
cross
,
as
I
have
already
describe
it
,
over
the
land
,
so
the
discovery
I
make
in
that
journey
make
me
very
eager
to
see
the
other
part
of
the
coast
;
and
now
I
have
a
boat
<EOS>
,
I
think
of
nothing
but
sailing
round
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
and
that
I
may
do
every
thing
with
discretion
and
consideration
,
I
fit
up
a
little
mast
to
my
boat
,
and
make
a
sail
to
it
out
of
some
of
the
piece
of
the
ship
's
sail
,
which
lie
in
store
,
and
of
which
I
have
a
great
store
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
have
fit
my
mast
and
sail
,
and
try
the
boat
,
I
find
she
would
sail
very
well
.
<EOS>
then
I
make
little
locker
and
box
at
each
end
of
my
boat
,
to
put
provision
,
necessary
,
and
ammunition
,
&
c.
into
,
to
be
keep
dry
,
either
from
rain
,
or
the
spray
of
the
sea
;
and
a
little
long
hollow
place
I
cut
in
the
inside
of
the
boat
,
where
I
could
lay
my
gun
,
make
a
flap
to
hang
down
over
it
to
keep
it
dry
.
  
<EOS>
I
fix
my
umbrella
also
in
a
step
at
the
stern
,
like
a
mast
,
to
stand
over
my
head
,
and
keep
the
heat
of
the
sun
off
me
,
like
an
awning
;
and
thus
I
every
now
and
then
take
a
little
voyage
upon
the
sea
,
but
never
go
far
out
,
nor
far
from
the
little
creek
;
but
at
last
,
be
eager
to
view
the
circumference
of
my
little
kingdom
,
I
resolve
upon
my
tour
,
and
accordingly
I
victual
my
ship
for
the
voyage
;
put
in
two
dozen
of
my
loaf
(
cake
I
should
rather
call
them
)
of
barley
-
bread
;
an
earthen
pot
full
of
parched
rice
,
a
food
I
eat
a
great
deal
of
,
a
little
bottle
of
rum
,
half
a
goat
,
and
powder
with
shot
for
kill
more
,
and
two
large
watch
-
coat
,
of
those
which
,
as
I
mention
before
,
I
have
save
out
of
the
seaman
's
chest
;
<EOS>
these
I
take
,
one
to
lie
upon
,
and
the
other
to
cover
me
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
6th
of
November
,
in
the
sixth
year
of
my
reign
,
or
my
captivity
,
which
you
please
,
that
I
set
out
on
this
voyage
,
and
I
find
it
much
longer
than
I
expect
;
for
though
the
island
itself
be
not
very
large
,
yet
when
I
come
to
the
east
side
of
it
,
I
find
a
great
ledge
of
rock
lie
out
about
two
league
into
the
sea
,
<EOS>
some
above
water
,
some
under
it
;
and
beyond
this
a
shoal
of
sand
,
lie
dry
half
a
league
more
;
so
that
I
be
oblige
to
go
a
great
way
out
to
sea
to
double
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
first
discover
them
,
I
be
go
to
give
over
my
enterprise
,
and
come
back
again
,
not
know
how
far
it
may
oblige
me
to
go
out
to
sea
,
and
above
all
,
doubt
how
I
should
get
back
again
;
so
I
come
to
an
anchor
,
for
I
have
make
me
a
kind
of
an
anchor
with
a
piece
of
break
grapple
which
I
get
out
of
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
have
secure
my
boat
,
I
take
my
gun
,
and
go
on
shore
,
climb
up
an
hill
,
which
seem
to
over
-
look
that
point
,
where
I
see
the
full
extent
of
it
,
and
resolve
to
venture
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
view
the
sea
from
that
hill
where
I
stand
,
I
perceive
a
strong
,
and
indeed
a
most
furious
current
,
which
run
to
the
east
,
even
come
close
to
the
point
;
and
I
take
the
more
notice
of
it
,
because
I
see
there
may
be
some
danger
,
that
when
I
come
into
it
,
I
may
be
carry
out
to
sea
by
the
strength
of
it
,
and
not
be
able
to
make
the
island
again
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
have
I
not
get
first
upon
this
hill
,
I
believe
it
would
have
be
so
;
for
there
be
the
same
current
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
only
that
it
set
off
at
a
farth
distance
;
and
I
see
there
be
a
strong
eddy
under
the
shore
;
so
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
out
of
the
first
current
,
and
I
should
presently
be
in
an
eddy
.
  
<EOS>
I
lie
here
,
however
,
two
day
;
because
the
wind
blow
pretty
fresh
(
at
E.S.E.
and
that
be
just
contrary
to
the
say
current
)
make
a
great
breach
of
the
sea
upon
the
point
;
so
that
it
be
not
safe
for
me
to
keep
too
close
to
the
shore
for
the
breach
,
nor
to
go
too
far
off
because
of
the
stream
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
day
in
the
morning
,
the
wind
have
abate
over
-
night
,
the
sea
be
calm
,
and
I
venture
;
but
I
be
a
warning
-
piece
again
to
all
rash
and
ignorant
pilot
;
for
no
sooner
be
<EOS>
I
come
to
the
point
,
when
I
be
not
my
boat
's
length
from
the
shore
,
but
I
find
myself
in
a
great
depth
of
water
,
and
a
current
like
a
sluice
of
a
mill
.
<EOS>
It
carry
my
boat
along
with
it
with
such
violence
,
that
all
I
could
do
could
not
keep
her
so
much
as
on
the
edge
of
it
:
but
I
find
it
hurry
me
farther
and
farther
out
from
the
eddy
,
which
be
on
the
left
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
wind
stir
to
help
me
,
and
all
that
I
could
do
with
my
paddle
signify
nothing
;
and
now
I
begin
to
give
myself
over
for
lose
;
for
,
as
the
current
be
on
both
side
the
island
,
I
know
in
a
few
league
distance
they
must
join
again
,
and
then
I
be
irrecoverably
go
;
nor
do
I
see
any
possibility
of
avoid
it
;
so
that
I
have
no
prospect
before
me
but
of
perish
;
not
by
the
sea
,
for
that
be
calm
enough
,
but
of
starve
for
hunger
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
find
a
tortoise
on
the
shore
,
as
big
almost
as
I
could
lift
,
and
have
toss
it
into
the
boat
;
and
I
have
a
great
jar
of
fresh
water
,
that
be
to
say
,
one
of
my
earthen
pot
;
but
what
be
all
this
to
be
drive
into
the
vast
ocean
,
where
,
to
be
sure
,
there
be
no
shore
,
no
main
land
or
island
,
for
a
thousand
league
at
least
?
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
see
how
easy
it
be
for
the
providence
of
God
to
make
the
most
miserable
condition
that
mankind
could
be
in
,
bad
.
<EOS>
now
I
look
back
upon
my
desolate
solitary
island
,
as
the
most
pleasant
place
in
the
world
,
and
all
the
happiness
my
heart
could
wish
for
,
be
to
be
there
again
:
I
stretch
out
my
hand
to
it
with
eager
wish
;
"
o
happy
desert
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
I
shall
never
see
thee
more
!
<EOS>
o
miserable
creature
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
whither
be
I
go
!
"
<EOS>
then
I
reproach
myself
with
my
unthankful
temper
,
and
how
I
have
repine
at
my
solitary
condition
;
and
now
what
would
I
give
to
be
on
shore
there
again
?
<EOS>
thus
we
never
see
the
true
state
of
our
condition
,
till
it
be
illustrate
to
us
by
its
contrary
;
nor
know
how
to
value
what
we
enjoy
,
but
by
the
want
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
scarce
possible
to
imagine
the
consternation
I
be
now
in
,
be
drive
from
my
beloved
island
(
for
so
it
appear
to
me
now
to
be
)
into
the
wide
ocean
,
almost
two
league
,
and
in
the
utmost
despair
of
ever
recover
it
again
:
however
,
I
work
hard
,
till
indeed
my
strength
be
almost
exhausted
;
and
keep
my
boat
as
much
to
the
northward
,
that
is
,
towards
the
side
of
the
current
which
the
eddy
lie
on
,
as
possibly
I
could
;
when
about
noon
,
as
the
sun
pass
the
meridian
,
I
think
I
feel
a
little
breeze
of
wind
in
my
face
,
spring
up
from
the
S.S.E.
<EOS>
this
cheer
my
heart
a
little
,
and
especially
when
in
about
half
an
hour
more
it
blow
a
pretty
small
gentle
gale
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
be
get
at
a
frightful
distance
from
the
island
;
and
,
have
the
least
cloud
or
hazy
weather
intervene
,
I
have
be
undo
another
way
too
;
for
I
have
no
compass
on
board
,
and
should
never
have
know
how
to
have
steer
towards
the
island
,
if
I
have
but
once
lose
sight
of
it
;
but
the
weather
continue
clear
,
I
apply
myself
to
get
up
my
mast
again
,
and
spread
my
sail
,
stand
away
to
the
north
as
much
as
possible
,
to
get
out
of
the
current
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
set
my
mast
and
sail
,
and
the
boat
begin
to
stretch
away
,
I
see
even
by
the
clearness
of
the
water
,
some
alteration
of
the
current
be
near
;
where
the
current
be
so
strong
,
the
water
be
foul
;
but
perceive
the
water
clear
<EOS>
,
I
find
the
current
abate
,
and
presently
I
find
to
the
east
,
at
about
half
a
mile
,
a
breach
of
the
sea
upon
some
rock
:
these
rock
I
find
cause
the
current
to
part
again
;
and
as
the
main
stress
of
it
run
away
more
southerly
,
leave
the
rock
to
the
north
-
east
,
so
the
other
return
by
the
repulse
of
the
rock
,
and
make
a
strong
eddy
,
which
run
back
again
to
the
north
-
west
with
a
very
sharp
stream
.
  
<EOS>
They
who
know
what
it
be
to
have
a
reprieve
bring
to
them
upon
the
ladder
,
or
to
be
rescue
from
thief
just
go
to
murder
them
,
or
who
have
be
in
such
like
extremity
,
may
guess
what
my
present
surprise
of
joy
be
,
and
how
gladly
I
put
my
boat
into
the
stream
of
this
eddy
;
and
the
wind
also
freshen
,
how
gladly
I
spread
my
sail
to
it
,
run
cheerfully
before
the
wind
,
and
with
a
strong
tide
or
eddy
under
foot
.
  
<EOS>
this
eddy
carry
me
about
a
league
in
my
way
back
again
directly
towards
the
island
,
but
about
two
league
more
towards
the
northward
than
the
current
lay
,
which
carry
me
away
at
first
;
so
that
when
I
come
near
the
island
,
I
find
myself
open
to
the
northern
shore
of
it
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
other
end
of
the
island
,
opposite
to
that
which
I
go
out
from
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
make
something
more
than
a
league
of
way
by
the
help
of
this
current
or
eddy
,
I
find
it
be
spend
,
and
serve
me
no
farther
.
<EOS>
however
I
find
,
<EOS>
that
be
between
the
two
great
current
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
on
the
south
side
which
have
hurry
me
away
,
and
that
on
the
north
which
lie
about
two
league
on
the
other
side
;
I
say
,
between
these
two
,
in
the
west
of
the
island
,
I
find
the
water
at
least
still
,
and
run
no
way
;
and
have
still
a
breeze
of
wind
fair
for
me
,
I
keep
on
steer
directly
for
the
island
,
though
not
make
such
fresh
way
as
I
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
about
four
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
be
then
within
about
a
league
of
the
island
<EOS>
,
I
find
the
point
of
the
rock
which
occasion
this
distance
stretch
out
as
be
describe
before
,
to
the
southward
,
and
cast
off
the
current
more
southwardly
,
have
of
course
make
another
eddy
to
the
north
;
and
this
I
find
very
strong
,
but
directly
set
the
way
my
course
lie
,
which
be
due
west
,
but
almost
full
north
.
<EOS>
however
,
have
a
fresh
gale
,
I
stretch
across
this
eddy
slant
north
-
west
,
and
in
about
an
hour
come
within
about
a
mile
of
the
shore
,
where
,
it
be
smooth
water
,
I
soon
get
to
land
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
on
shore
,
I
fall
on
my
knee
,
and
give
God
thank
for
my
deliverance
,
resolve
to
lay
aside
all
thought
of
my
deliverance
by
my
boat
;
and
refresh
myself
with
such
thing
as
I
have
,
I
bring
my
boat
close
to
the
shore
,
in
a
little
cove
that
I
have
espy
under
some
tree
,
and
lay
me
down
to
sleep
,
be
quite
spend
with
the
labour
and
fatigue
of
the
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
at
a
great
loss
which
way
to
get
home
with
my
boat
;
I
have
run
so
much
hazard
,
and
know
too
much
the
case
to
think
of
attempt
it
by
the
way
I
go
out
;
and
what
may
be
at
the
other
side
(
I
mean
the
west
side
)
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
nor
have
I
any
mind
to
run
any
more
venture
;
<EOS>
so
I
only
resolve
in
the
morning
to
make
my
way
westward
along
the
shore
,
and
to
see
if
there
be
no
creek
where
I
may
lay
up
my
frigate
in
safety
,
so
as
to
have
her
again
if
I
want
her
.
<EOS>
in
about
three
mile
,
or
thereabout
,
coast
the
shore
,
I
come
to
a
very
good
inlet
,
or
bay
,
about
a
mile
over
,
which
narrow
till
it
come
to
a
very
little
rivulet
,
or
brook
,
where
I
find
a
convenient
harbour
for
my
boat
,
and
where
she
lie
as
if
she
have
be
in
a
little
dock
make
on
purpose
for
her
:
here
I
put
in
,
and
have
stow
my
boat
very
safe
,
I
go
on
shore
to
look
about
me
,
and
see
where
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
find
I
have
<EOS>
but
a
little
pass
by
the
place
where
I
have
be
before
when
I
travel
on
foot
to
that
shore
;
so
take
nothing
out
of
my
boat
<EOS>
but
my
gun
and
my
umbrella
,
for
it
be
exceed
hot
<EOS>
,
I
begin
my
march
:
the
way
be
comfortable
enough
after
such
a
voyage
as
I
have
be
upon
,
and
I
reach
my
old
bower
in
the
evening
,
where
I
find
every
thing
stand
as
I
leave
it
;
for
I
always
keep
it
in
good
order
,
be
,
as
I
say
before
,
my
country
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
over
the
fence
,
and
lay
me
down
in
the
shade
to
rest
my
limb
,
for
I
be
very
weary
,
and
fall
asleep
:
but
judge
you
if
you
can
,
that
read
my
story
,
what
a
surprise
<EOS>
I
must
be
in
when
I
be
awake
out
of
my
sleep
by
a
voice
call
me
by
my
name
several
time
,
"
Robin
,
Robin
,
<EOS>
Robin
Crusoe
,
poor
Robin
Crusoe
!
<EOS>
where
be
you
,
Robin
Crusoe
?
<EOS>
where
be
you
?
<EOS>
where
have
you
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
dead
asleep
at
first
,
be
fatigue
with
rowing
,
or
paddle
,
as
it
be
call
,
the
first
part
of
the
day
,
and
walk
the
latter
part
,
that
I
do
not
awake
thoroughly
;
and
doze
between
sleep
and
wake
,
think
I
dream
that
somebody
speak
to
me
:
<EOS>
but
as
the
voice
continue
to
repeat
Robin
Crusoe
,
Robin
Crusoe
;
at
last
I
begin
to
awake
more
perfectly
,
and
be
at
first
dreadfully
fright
,
and
start
up
in
the
utmost
consternation
:
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
be
my
eye
open
,
but
I
see
my
Pol
sit
on
the
top
of
the
hedge
,
and
immediately
know
that
this
be
he
that
speak
to
me
;
for
just
in
such
bemoan
language
I
have
use
to
talk
to
him
,
and
teach
him
;
and
he
have
learn
it
so
perfectly
,
that
he
would
sit
upon
my
finger
,
and
lie
his
bill
close
to
my
face
,
and
cry
,
"
<EOS>
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
,
where
be
you
?
<EOS>
where
have
you
be
?
<EOS>
how
come
you
here
?
"
and
such
thing
as
I
have
teach
him
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
even
though
I
know
it
be
the
parrot
,
and
that
indeed
it
could
be
nobody
else
,
it
be
a
good
while
before
I
could
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
be
amazed
how
the
creature
get
thither
,
and
then
how
he
should
just
keep
about
the
place
,
and
no
where
else
:
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
well
satisfied
it
could
be
nobody
but
honest
Poll
<EOS>
,
I
get
it
over
;
and
hold
out
my
hand
,
and
call
him
by
his
Name
Poll
,
the
sociable
Creature
come
to
me
,
and
sit
upon
my
Thumb
,
as
he
use
to
do
,
and
continue
talk
to
me
,
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
,
and
how
do
I
come
here
?
<EOS>
and
where
have
I
be
?
<EOS>
just
as
if
he
have
be
overjoy
to
see
me
again
;
and
so
I
carry
him
home
along
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
have
enough
of
ramble
to
sea
for
some
time
,
and
have
enough
to
do
for
many
day
to
sit
still
,
and
reflect
upon
the
danger
I
have
be
in
:
I
would
have
be
very
glad
to
have
have
my
boat
again
on
my
side
of
the
island
;
but
I
know
not
how
it
be
practicable
to
get
it
about
as
to
the
east
side
of
the
island
,
which
I
have
go
round
;
I
know
well
enough
<EOS>
there
be
no
venture
that
way
;
my
very
heart
would
shrink
,
and
my
very
blood
run
chill
but
to
think
of
it
:
and
as
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
I
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
there
;
but
suppose
the
current
run
with
the
same
force
against
the
shore
at
the
east
as
it
pass
by
it
on
the
other
,
I
may
run
the
same
risk
of
be
drive
down
the
stream
,
and
carry
by
the
island
,
as
I
have
be
before
,
of
be
carry
away
from
it
;
so
with
these
thought
I
content
my
self
to
be
without
any
boat
,
though
it
have
be
the
product
of
so
many
month
labour
to
make
it
,
and
of
so
many
more
to
get
it
unto
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
government
of
my
temper
,
I
remain
near
a
year
,
live
a
very
sedate
retire
life
,
as
you
may
well
suppose
;
and
my
thought
be
very
much
compose
as
to
my
condition
,
and
fully
comfort
in
resign
my
self
to
the
disposition
of
Providence
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
live
really
very
happily
in
all
thing
,
except
that
of
society
.
  
<EOS>
I
improve
my
self
in
this
time
in
all
the
mechanic
exercise
which
my
necessity
put
me
upon
apply
my
self
to
,
and
I
believe
could
,
upon
occasion
,
make
a
very
good
carpenter
,
especially
consider
how
few
tool
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
,
I
arrive
at
an
unexpected
perfection
in
my
earthen
ware
,
and
contrive
well
enough
to
make
them
with
a
wheel
,
which
I
find
infinitely
easy
and
well
;
because
I
make
thing
round
and
shapeable
,
which
before
be
filthy
thing
indeed
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
be
never
more
vain
of
my
own
performance
,
or
more
joyful
for
any
thing
I
find
out
,
than
for
my
be
able
to
make
a
tobacco
-
pipe
.
<EOS>
and
tho
it
be
a
very
ugly
clumsy
thing
,
when
it
be
do
,
and
only
burn
red
like
other
earthen
ware
,
yet
as
it
be
hard
and
firm
,
and
would
draw
the
smoke
<EOS>
,
I
be
exceedingly
comfort
with
it
,
for
I
have
be
always
use
to
smoke
,
and
there
be
pipe
in
the
ship
,
but
I
forget
them
at
first
,
not
know
that
there
be
tobacco
in
the
island
;
and
afterwards
,
when
I
search
the
ship
again
,
I
could
not
come
at
any
pipe
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
wicker
ware
also
I
improve
much
,
and
make
abundance
of
necessary
basket
,
as
well
as
my
invention
shew
me
,
tho
not
very
handsome
,
yet
they
be
such
as
be
very
handy
and
convenient
for
my
lay
thing
up
in
,
or
fetching
thing
home
in
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
if
I
kill
a
goat
abroad
,
I
could
hang
it
up
in
a
tree
,
flea
it
,
and
dress
it
,
and
cut
it
in
piece
,
and
bring
it
home
in
a
basket
,
and
the
like
by
a
turtle
,
I
could
cut
it
up
,
take
out
the
egg
,
and
a
piece
or
two
of
the
flesh
,
which
be
enough
for
me
,
and
bring
them
home
in
a
basket
,
and
leave
the
rest
behind
me
.
<EOS>
also
large
deep
basket
be
my
receiver
for
my
corn
,
which
I
always
rub
out
as
soon
as
it
be
dry
,
and
cure
,
and
keep
it
in
great
basket
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
perceive
my
powder
abate
considerably
,
and
this
be
a
want
which
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
supply
,
and
I
begin
seriously
to
consider
what
I
must
do
when
I
should
have
no
more
powder
;
that
be
to
say
,
how
I
should
do
to
kill
any
goat
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
as
be
observe
in
the
third
year
of
my
being
here
,
keep
a
young
kid
,
and
breed
her
up
tame
,
and
I
be
in
hope
of
get
a
he
-
goat
,
but
I
could
not
by
any
mean
bring
it
to
pass
,
 
'
till
my
kid
grow
an
old
goat
;
and
I
could
never
find
in
my
heart
to
kill
her
,
till
she
dye
at
last
of
mere
age
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
now
in
the
eleventh
year
of
my
residence
,
and
,
as
I
have
say
,
my
ammunition
grow
low
,
I
set
myself
to
study
some
art
to
trap
and
snare
the
goat
,
to
see
whether
I
could
not
catch
some
of
them
alive
;
and
particularly
I
want
a
she
-
goat
great
with
young
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
purpose
I
make
snare
to
hamper
them
;
and
believe
they
be
more
than
once
take
in
them
;
but
my
tackle
be
not
good
,
for
I
have
no
wire
,
and
always
find
them
break
,
and
my
bait
devour
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
I
resolve
to
try
a
pitfall
;
so
I
dig
several
large
pit
in
the
earth
,
in
place
where
I
have
observe
the
goat
use
to
feed
,
and
over
these
pit
I
place
hurdle
of
my
own
making
too
,
with
a
great
weight
upon
them
;
and
several
time
I
put
ear
of
barley
,
and
dry
rice
,
without
set
the
trap
;
and
I
could
easily
perceive
,
that
the
goat
have
go
in
,
and
eaten
up
the
corn
,
that
I
could
see
the
mark
of
their
foot
:
at
length
,
I
set
three
trap
in
one
night
,
and
go
the
next
morning
<EOS>
,
I
find
them
all
stand
,
and
yet
the
bait
eat
and
go
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
discouraging
;
however
,
I
alter
my
trap
;
and
,
not
to
trouble
you
with
particular
,
go
one
morning
to
see
my
trap
<EOS>
,
I
find
in
one
of
them
a
large
old
he
-
goat
;
and
,
in
one
of
the
other
,
three
kid
,
a
male
and
two
female
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
old
one
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
with
him
;
he
be
so
fierce
<EOS>
I
durst
not
go
into
the
pit
to
him
;
that
be
to
say
,
to
go
about
to
bring
him
away
alive
,
which
be
what
I
want
;
I
could
have
kill
him
,
but
that
be
not
my
business
,
nor
would
it
answer
my
end
<EOS>
;
so
I
e'en
let
him
out
,
and
he
run
away
as
if
he
have
be
frighten
out
of
his
wit
;
but
I
do
not
then
know
what
I
afterwards
learn
,
that
hunger
would
tame
a
lion
:
if
I
have
let
him
stay
there
three
or
four
day
without
food
,
and
then
have
carry
him
some
water
to
drink
,
and
then
a
little
corn
,
he
would
have
be
as
tame
as
one
of
the
kid
;
for
they
be
mighty
sagacious
tractable
creature
,
where
they
be
well
used
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
for
the
present
I
let
him
go
,
know
no
better
at
that
time
;
then
I
go
to
the
three
kid
;
and
,
take
them
one
by
one
<EOS>
,
I
tie
them
with
string
together
;
and
with
some
difficulty
bring
them
all
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
while
before
they
would
feed
;
but
throw
them
some
sweet
corn
,
it
tempt
them
,
and
they
begin
to
be
tame
:
<EOS>
and
now
I
find
,
that
if
I
expect
to
supply
myself
with
goat
's
flesh
,
when
I
have
no
powder
or
shoot
leave
,
breed
some
up
tame
be
my
only
way
,
when
perhaps
I
may
have
them
about
my
house
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
it
presently
occur
to
me
,
that
I
must
keep
the
tame
from
the
wild
,
or
else
they
would
always
run
wild
when
they
grow
up
;
and
the
only
way
for
this
be
to
have
some
enclose
piece
of
ground
,
<EOS>
well
fence
either
with
hedge
or
pale
,
to
keep
them
up
so
effectually
,
that
those
within
may
not
break
out
,
or
those
without
break
in
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
undertaking
for
one
pair
of
hand
;
yet
as
I
see
there
be
an
absolute
necessity
of
do
it
,
my
first
piece
of
work
be
to
find
out
a
proper
piece
of
ground
;
viz
.
<EOS>
where
there
be
likely
to
be
herbage
for
them
to
eat
,
water
for
them
to
drink
,
and
cover
to
keep
them
from
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
understand
such
enclosure
,
will
think
I
have
very
little
contrivance
,
when
I
pitch
upon
a
place
very
proper
for
all
these
,
be
a
plain
open
piece
of
meadow
-
land
or
savanna
(
as
our
people
call
it
in
the
western
colony
)
which
have
two
or
three
little
drill
of
fresh
water
in
it
,
and
at
one
end
be
very
woody
;
I
say
they
will
smile
at
my
forecast
,
when
I
shall
tell
them
I
begin
my
enclosing
of
this
piece
of
ground
in
such
a
manner
,
that
my
hedge
or
pale
must
have
be
at
least
two
mile
about
;
nor
be
the
madness
of
it
so
great
as
to
the
compass
;
for
if
it
be
ten
mile
about
,
I
be
like
to
have
time
enough
to
do
it
in
;
but
I
do
not
consider
;
that
my
goat
would
be
as
wild
in
so
much
compass
,
as
if
they
have
have
the
whole
island
;
and
I
should
have
so
much
room
to
chase
them
in
,
that
I
should
never
catch
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
hedge
be
begin
and
carry
on
,
I
believe
,
about
fifty
yard
,
when
this
thought
occur
to
me
;
so
I
presently
stop
short
,
and
for
the
first
beginning
I
resolve
to
enclose
a
piece
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yard
in
length
,
and
one
hundred
yard
in
breadth
,
which
as
it
would
maintain
as
many
as
I
should
have
in
any
reasonable
time
,
so
,
as
my
flock
increase
,
I
could
add
more
ground
to
my
enclosure
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
act
with
some
prudence
,
and
I
go
to
work
with
courage
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
three
month
hedge
in
the
first
piece
;
and
,
till
I
have
do
it
,
I
tether
the
three
kid
in
the
good
part
of
it
,
and
use
them
to
feed
as
near
me
as
possible
,
to
make
them
familiar
;
and
very
often
I
would
go
and
carry
them
some
ear
of
barley
,
or
a
handful
of
rice
,
and
feed
them
out
of
my
hand
;
so
that
after
my
enclosure
be
finish
,
and
I
let
them
loose
,
they
would
follow
me
up
and
down
,
bleat
after
me
for
a
handful
of
corn
.
  
<EOS>
this
answer
my
end
,
and
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
I
have
a
flock
of
about
twelve
goat
,
kid
and
all
;
and
in
two
year
more
I
have
three
-
and
-
forty
,
besides
several
that
I
take
and
kill
for
my
food
;
and
after
that
I
enclose
five
several
piece
of
ground
to
feed
them
in
,
with
little
pen
to
drive
them
into
,
to
take
them
as
I
want
them
;
and
gate
out
of
one
piece
of
ground
into
another
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
;
for
now
I
not
only
have
goat
's
flesh
to
feed
on
when
I
please
,
but
milk
too
,
a
thing
which
indeed
in
my
beginning
I
do
not
so
much
as
think
of
,
and
which
,
when
it
come
into
my
thought
,
be
really
an
agreeable
surprise
;
for
now
I
set
up
my
dairy
,
and
have
sometimes
a
gallon
or
two
of
milk
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
and
as
nature
,
who
give
supply
of
food
to
every
creature
,
dictate
even
naturally
how
to
make
use
of
it
;
so
I
,
that
never
milk
a
cow
,
much
less
a
goat
,
or
see
butter
or
cheese
make
,
very
readily
and
handily
,
though
after
a
great
many
essay
and
miscarriage
,
make
me
both
butter
and
cheese
at
last
,
and
never
want
it
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
how
mercifully
can
our
great
Creator
treat
his
creature
,
even
in
those
condition
in
which
they
seem
to
be
overwhelm
in
destruction
!
<EOS>
how
can
he
sweeten
the
bitter
providence
,
and
give
us
cause
to
praise
him
for
dungeon
and
prison
!
<EOS>
what
a
table
be
here
spread
for
me
in
a
wilderness
,
where
I
see
nothing
at
first
but
to
perish
for
hunger
!
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
make
a
stoic
smile
,
to
have
see
me
and
my
little
family
sit
down
to
dinner
:
there
be
my
majesty
,
the
prince
and
lord
of
the
whole
island
;
I
have
the
life
of
all
my
subject
at
absolute
command
;
I
could
hang
,
draw
,
give
life
and
liberty
,
and
take
it
away
,
and
no
rebel
among
all
my
subject
.
  
<EOS>
then
to
see
how
like
a
king
I
dine
too
,
all
alone
,
attend
by
my
servant
!
<EOS>
Pol
,
as
if
he
have
be
my
favourite
,
as
the
only
person
permit
to
talk
to
me
;
my
dog
,
which
be
now
grow
very
old
and
crazy
,
and
find
no
species
to
multiply
his
kind
upon
,
sit
always
at
my
right
hand
;
and
two
cat
,
one
on
one
side
the
table
,
and
one
on
the
other
,
expect
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
bit
from
my
hand
,
as
a
mark
of
special
favour
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
be
not
the
two
cat
which
I
bring
on
shore
at
first
;
for
they
be
both
of
them
dead
,
and
have
be
inter
near
my
habitation
by
my
own
hand
;
but
one
of
them
have
multiply
by
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
kind
of
creature
,
these
be
two
which
I
preserve
tame
,
whereas
the
rest
run
wild
into
the
wood
,
and
become
indeed
troublesome
to
me
at
last
;
for
they
would
often
come
into
my
house
,
and
plunder
me
too
,
till
at
last
I
be
oblige
to
shoot
them
,
and
do
kill
a
great
many
:
at
length
they
leave
me
.
<EOS>
with
this
attendance
,
and
in
this
plentiful
manner
,
I
live
;
neither
could
I
be
say
to
want
any
thing
but
society
,
and
of
that
,
in
some
time
after
this
,
I
be
like
to
have
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
something
impatient
,
as
I
have
observe
,
to
have
the
use
of
my
boat
,
though
very
loath
to
run
any
more
hazard
;
and
therefore
sometimes
I
sit
contrive
way
to
get
her
about
the
island
,
and
at
other
time
I
sit
myself
down
contented
enough
without
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
strange
uneasiness
in
my
mind
to
go
down
to
the
point
of
the
island
,
where
,
as
I
have
say
in
my
last
ramble
,
I
go
up
the
hill
to
see
how
the
shore
lie
,
and
how
the
current
set
,
that
I
may
see
what
I
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
this
inclination
increase
upon
me
every
day
,
and
at
length
I
resolve
to
travel
thither
by
land
,
and
follow
the
edge
of
the
shore
,
I
do
so
;
but
have
any
one
in
England
be
to
meet
such
a
man
as
I
be
,
it
must
either
have
fright
them
,
or
raise
a
great
deal
of
laughter
;
and
as
I
frequently
stand
still
to
look
at
myself
,
I
could
not
but
smile
at
the
notion
of
my
travelling
through
Yorkshire
with
such
an
equipage
,
and
in
such
a
dress
.
<EOS>
be
pleased
to
take
a
sketch
of
my
figure
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
high
shapeless
cap
,
make
of
goat
's
skin
,
with
a
flap
hang
down
behind
,
as
well
to
keep
the
sun
from
me
,
as
to
shoot
the
rain
off
from
run
into
my
neck
;
nothing
be
so
hurtful
in
these
climate
,
as
the
rain
upon
the
flesh
under
the
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
short
jacket
of
goat
's
skin
,
the
skirt
come
down
to
about
the
middle
of
my
thigh
;
and
a
pair
of
open
-
kneed
breech
of
the
same
;
the
breech
be
make
of
a
skin
of
an
old
he
-
goat
,
whose
hair
hang
down
such
a
length
on
either
side
,
that
,
like
pantaloon
,
it
reach
to
the
middle
of
my
leg
.
<EOS>
stocking
and
shoe
<EOS>
I
have
none
;
but
I
have
make
me
a
pair
of
something
,
I
scarce
know
what
to
call
them
,
like
buskin
,
to
flap
over
my
leg
,
and
lace
on
either
side
like
spatterdashe
;
but
of
a
most
barbarous
shape
,
as
indeed
be
all
the
rest
of
my
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
on
a
broad
belt
of
goat
's
skin
dry
,
which
I
draw
together
with
two
thong
of
the
same
,
instead
of
buckle
;
and
in
a
kind
of
a
frog
on
either
side
of
this
,
instead
of
a
sword
and
dagger
,
hang
a
little
saw
and
a
hatchet
;
one
on
one
side
,
one
on
the
other
<EOS>
:
I
have
another
belt
not
so
broad
,
and
fasten
in
the
same
manner
,
which
hang
over
my
shoulder
;
and
at
the
end
of
it
,
under
my
left
arm
,
hang
two
pouch
,
both
make
of
goat
's
skin
too
;
in
one
of
which
hang
my
powder
,
in
the
other
my
shot
:
at
my
back
I
carry
my
basket
,
on
my
shoulder
my
gun
,
and
over
my
head
a
great
clumsy
ugly
goat
's
skin
umbrella
;
but
which
,
after
all
,
be
the
most
necessary
thing
I
have
about
me
,
next
to
my
gun
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
face
,
the
colour
of
it
be
really
not
so
Mulatto
-
like
as
one
may
expect
from
a
man
not
at
all
careful
of
it
,
and
live
within
nine
or
ten
degree
of
the
equinox
.
<EOS>
My
beard
I
have
once
suffer
to
grow
till
it
be
about
a
quarter
of
a
yard
long
;
but
as
I
have
both
scissar
and
razor
sufficient
,
I
have
cut
it
pretty
short
,
except
what
grow
on
my
upper
lip
,
which
I
have
trim
into
a
large
pair
of
Mahometan
whisker
,
such
as
I
have
see
wear
by
some
Turks
whom
I
see
at
Sallee
;
for
the
Moors
do
not
wear
such
,
though
the
Turks
do
:
of
these
mustachio
,
or
whisker
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
say
they
be
long
enough
to
hang
my
hat
upon
them
;
but
they
be
of
length
and
shape
monstrous
enough
,
and
such
as
in
England
would
have
pass
for
frightful
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
by
the
by
;
for
as
to
my
figure
,
I
have
so
few
to
observe
me
,
that
it
be
of
no
manner
of
consequence
;
so
I
say
no
more
to
that
part
.
<EOS>
in
this
kind
of
figure
<EOS>
I
go
my
new
journey
,
and
be
out
five
or
six
day
.
<EOS>
I
travel
first
along
the
sea
shore
,
directly
to
the
place
where
I
first
bring
my
boat
to
an
anchor
,
to
get
up
upon
the
rock
;
and
,
have
no
boat
now
to
take
care
of
,
I
go
over
the
land
a
near
way
,
to
the
same
height
that
I
be
upon
before
;
when
look
forward
to
the
point
of
the
rock
which
lie
out
,
and
which
I
be
to
double
with
my
boat
,
as
I
say
above
,
I
be
surprised
to
see
the
sea
all
smooth
and
quiet
;
no
rippling
,
no
motion
,
no
current
,
any
more
there
than
in
other
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
at
a
strange
loss
to
understand
this
,
and
resolve
to
spend
some
time
in
the
observing
of
it
,
to
see
if
nothing
from
the
set
of
the
tide
have
occasion
it
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
presently
convince
how
it
be
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
tide
of
ebb
set
from
the
west
,
and
join
with
the
current
of
water
from
some
great
river
on
the
shore
,
must
be
the
occasion
of
this
current
,
and
that
accord
as
the
wind
blow
more
forcible
from
the
west
,
or
from
the
north
,
this
current
come
near
,
or
go
farther
from
the
shore
;
for
,
wait
thereabout
till
evening
,
I
go
up
to
the
rock
again
,
and
then
the
tide
of
the
ebb
be
make
,
I
plainly
see
the
current
again
as
before
,
only
that
it
run
farther
off
,
be
near
half
a
league
from
the
shore
;
whereas
,
in
my
case
,
it
set
close
upon
the
shore
,
and
hurry
me
in
my
canoe
along
with
it
,
which
at
another
time
it
would
not
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
observation
convince
me
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
observe
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
of
the
tide
,
and
I
may
very
easily
bring
my
boat
about
the
island
again
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
begin
to
think
of
put
it
in
practice
,
I
have
such
a
terror
upon
my
spirit
at
the
remembrance
of
the
danger
I
have
be
in
,
that
I
could
not
think
of
it
again
with
any
patience
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
I
take
up
another
resolution
,
which
be
more
safe
,
though
more
laborious
;
and
this
be
,
that
I
would
build
,
or
rather
make
me
another
periagua
,
or
canoe
;
and
so
have
one
for
one
side
of
the
island
,
and
one
for
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
to
understand
,
that
now
I
have
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
two
plantation
in
the
island
;
one
my
little
fortification
or
tent
,
with
the
wall
about
it
under
the
rock
,
with
the
cave
behind
me
,
which
by
this
time
I
have
enlarge
into
several
apartment
or
cave
,
one
within
another
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
,
which
be
the
dry
and
large
,
and
have
a
door
out
beyond
my
wall
or
fortification
,
that
be
to
say
,
beyond
where
my
wall
join
to
the
rock
,
be
all
fill
up
with
large
earthen
pot
,
of
which
I
have
give
an
account
,
and
with
fourteen
or
fifteen
great
basket
,
which
would
hold
five
or
six
bushel
each
,
where
I
lay
up
my
store
of
provision
,
especially
my
corn
,
some
in
the
ear
cut
off
short
from
the
straw
,
and
the
other
rub
out
with
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
my
wall
,
make
as
before
,
with
long
stake
or
pile
,
those
pile
grow
all
like
tree
,
and
be
by
this
time
grow
so
big
,
and
spread
so
very
much
,
that
there
be
not
the
least
appearance
,
to
any
one
's
view
,
of
any
habitation
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
near
this
dwelling
of
mine
,
but
a
little
farther
within
the
land
,
and
upon
low
ground
,
lie
my
two
piece
of
corn
-
ground
;
which
I
keep
duly
cultivate
and
sow
,
and
which
duly
yield
me
their
harvest
in
its
season
:
and
whenever
I
have
occasion
for
more
corn
,
I
have
more
land
adjoin
as
fit
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
I
have
my
country
-
seat
,
and
I
have
now
a
tolerable
plantation
there
also
;
for
first
,
I
have
my
little
bower
,
as
I
call
it
,
<EOS>
which
I
keep
in
repair
;
that
be
to
say
,
I
keep
the
hedge
which
circle
it
in
constantly
fit
up
to
its
usual
height
,
the
ladder
stand
always
in
the
inside
;
I
keep
the
tree
,
which
at
first
be
no
more
than
my
stake
,
but
be
now
grow
very
firm
and
tall
;
I
keep
them
always
so
cut
,
that
they
may
spread
and
grow
thick
and
wild
,
and
make
the
more
agreeable
shade
,
which
they
do
effectually
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
this
<EOS>
I
have
my
tent
always
stand
,
be
a
piece
of
a
sail
spread
over
pole
set
up
for
that
purpose
,
and
which
never
want
any
repair
or
renew
;
and
under
this
I
have
make
me
a
squab
or
couch
,
with
the
skin
of
the
creature
I
have
kill
,
and
with
other
soft
thing
,
and
a
blanket
lay
on
them
,
such
as
belong
to
our
sea
-
bedding
,
which
I
have
save
,
and
a
great
watch
-
coat
to
cover
me
;
and
here
,
whenever
I
have
occasion
to
be
absent
from
my
chief
seat
,
I
take
up
my
country
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
adjoin
to
this
I
have
my
enclosure
for
my
cattle
,
that
be
to
say
,
my
goat
:
and
as
I
have
take
an
inconceivable
deal
of
pain
to
fence
and
enclose
this
ground
,
I
be
so
uneasy
to
see
it
keep
entire
,
lest
the
goat
should
break
through
,
that
I
never
leave
off
,
till
with
infinite
labour
I
have
stick
the
outside
of
the
hedge
so
full
of
small
stake
,
and
so
near
to
one
another
,
that
it
be
rather
a
pale
than
a
hedge
,
and
there
be
scarce
room
to
put
a
hand
through
between
them
,
which
afterwards
,
when
those
stake
grow
,
as
they
all
do
in
the
next
rainy
season
,
make
the
enclosure
strong
,
like
a
wall
,
indeed
strong
than
any
wall
.
  
<EOS>
this
will
testify
for
me
that
I
be
not
idle
,
and
that
I
spare
no
pain
to
bring
to
pass
whatever
appear
necessary
for
my
comfortable
support
;
for
I
consider
the
keeping
up
a
breed
of
tame
creature
thus
at
my
hand
,
would
be
a
live
magazine
of
flesh
,
milk
,
butter
,
and
cheese
,
for
me
as
long
as
I
live
in
the
place
,
if
it
be
to
be
forty
year
;
and
that
keep
them
in
my
reach
,
depend
entirely
upon
my
perfect
my
enclosure
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
may
be
sure
of
keep
them
together
;
which
by
this
method
indeed
I
so
effectually
secure
,
that
when
these
little
stake
begin
to
grow
,
I
have
plant
them
so
very
thick
,
I
be
force
to
pull
some
of
them
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
place
also
I
have
my
grape
grow
,
which
I
principally
depend
on
for
my
winter
store
of
raisin
,
and
which
I
never
fail
to
preserve
very
carefully
,
as
the
good
and
most
agreeable
dainty
of
my
whole
diet
;
and
indeed
they
be
not
agreeable
only
,
but
physical
,
wholesome
,
nourish
,
and
refreshing
to
the
last
degree
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
also
about
half
way
between
my
other
habitation
and
the
place
where
I
have
lay
up
my
boat
,
I
generally
staid
and
lie
here
in
my
way
thither
;
for
I
use
frequently
to
visit
my
boat
,
and
I
keep
all
thing
about
or
belong
to
her
in
very
good
order
<EOS>
:
sometimes
I
go
out
in
her
to
divert
myself
,
but
no
more
hazardous
voyage
<EOS>
would
I
go
,
nor
scarce
ever
above
a
stone
's
cast
or
two
from
the
shore
,
I
be
so
apprehensive
of
be
hurry
out
of
my
knowledge
again
by
the
current
,
or
wind
,
or
any
other
accident
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
come
to
a
new
scene
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
one
day
about
noon
,
go
towards
my
boat
<EOS>
,
I
be
exceedingly
surprised
with
the
print
of
a
man
's
naked
foot
on
the
shore
,
which
be
very
plain
to
be
see
in
the
sand
:
I
stand
like
one
thunder
-
strike
,
or
as
if
I
have
see
an
apparition
;
I
listen
<EOS>
,
I
look
round
me
,
I
could
hear
nothing
,
nor
see
any
thing
;
I
go
up
to
a
rise
ground
to
look
farther
:
<EOS>
I
go
up
the
shore
,
and
down
the
shore
,
but
it
be
all
one
,
I
could
see
no
other
impression
but
<EOS>
that
one
<EOS>
;
I
go
to
it
again
to
see
if
there
be
any
more
,
and
to
observe
if
it
may
not
be
my
fancy
;
but
there
be
no
room
for
that
,
for
there
be
exactly
the
very
print
of
a
foot
,
toe
,
heel
,
and
every
part
of
a
foot
;
how
it
come
thither
I
know
not
,
nor
could
in
the
least
imagine
.
<EOS>
but
after
innumerable
flutter
thought
,
like
a
man
perfectly
confused
,
and
out
of
myself
,
I
come
home
to
my
mortification
,
not
feel
,
as
we
say
,
the
ground
I
go
on
,
but
terrify
to
the
last
degree
,
look
behind
me
at
every
two
or
three
step
,
mistake
every
bush
and
tree
,
and
fancy
every
stump
at
a
distance
to
be
a
man
;
nor
be
it
possible
to
describe
how
many
various
shape
an
affright
imagination
represent
thing
to
me
in
;
how
many
wild
idea
be
form
every
moment
in
my
fancy
,
and
what
strange
unaccountable
whimsy
come
into
my
thought
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
my
castle
,
for
so
I
think
I
call
it
ever
after
this
<EOS>
,
I
flee
into
it
like
one
pursue
;
whether
I
go
over
by
the
ladder
,
as
first
contrived
,
or
go
in
at
the
hole
in
the
rock
,
which
I
call
a
door
,
I
can
not
remember
;
for
never
fright
hare
flee
to
cover
,
or
fox
to
earth
,
with
more
terror
of
mind
than
I
to
this
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
sleep
that
night
:
<EOS>
the
farther
I
be
from
the
occasion
of
my
fright
,
the
great
my
apprehension
be
;
which
be
something
contrary
to
the
nature
of
such
thing
,
and
especially
to
the
usual
practice
of
all
creature
in
fear
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
embarrassed
with
my
own
frightful
idea
of
the
thing
,
that
I
form
nothing
but
dismal
imagination
to
myself
,
even
though
I
be
now
a
great
way
off
it
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
fancy
it
must
be
the
devil
;
and
reason
join
in
with
me
upon
this
supposition
.
<EOS>
for
how
should
any
other
thing
in
human
shape
come
into
the
place
?
<EOS>
where
be
the
vessel
that
bring
them
?
<EOS>
what
mark
be
there
of
any
other
footstep
?
<EOS>
and
how
be
it
possible
a
man
should
come
there
?
<EOS>
but
then
to
think
that
Satan
should
take
human
shape
upon
him
in
such
a
place
where
there
could
be
no
manner
of
occasion
for
it
,
but
to
leave
the
print
of
his
foot
behind
him
,
and
that
even
for
no
purpose
too
(
for
he
could
not
be
sure
I
should
see
it
:
)
<EOS>
this
be
an
amazement
the
other
way
<EOS>
:
I
consider
that
the
devil
may
have
find
out
abundance
of
other
way
to
have
terrify
me
,
than
this
of
the
single
print
of
a
foot
;
that
as
I
live
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
he
would
never
have
be
so
simple
to
leave
a
mark
in
a
place
where
it
be
ten
thousand
to
one
whether
I
should
ever
see
it
or
not
,
and
in
the
sand
too
,
which
the
first
surge
of
the
sea
upon
an
high
wind
would
have
deface
entirely
.
<EOS>
all
this
seem
inconsistent
with
the
thing
itself
,
and
with
all
notion
we
usually
entertain
of
the
subtlety
of
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
abundance
of
such
thing
as
these
assist
to
argue
me
out
of
all
apprehension
of
its
be
the
devil
.
<EOS>
and
I
presently
conclude
that
it
must
be
some
more
dangerous
creature
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
it
must
be
some
of
the
savage
of
the
main
land
over
-
against
me
,
who
have
wander
out
to
sea
in
their
canoe
,
and
,
either
drive
by
the
current
,
or
by
contrary
wind
,
have
make
the
island
,
and
have
be
on
shore
,
but
be
go
away
again
to
sea
,
be
as
loath
,
perhaps
,
to
have
staid
in
this
desolate
island
,
as
I
would
have
be
to
have
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
reflection
be
roll
upon
my
mind
,
I
be
very
thankful
in
my
thought
,
that
I
be
so
happy
as
not
to
be
thereabout
at
that
time
,
or
that
they
do
not
see
my
boat
,
by
which
they
would
have
conclude
,
that
some
inhabitant
have
be
in
the
place
,
and
perhaps
have
search
farther
for
me
.
<EOS>
then
terrible
thought
rack
my
imagination
about
their
have
find
my
boat
,
and
that
there
be
people
here
;
and
that
if
so
,
I
should
certainly
have
them
come
again
in
great
number
,
and
devour
me
;
that
if
it
should
happen
so
that
they
should
not
find
me
,
yet
they
would
find
my
enclosure
,
destroy
all
my
corn
,
carry
away
all
my
flock
of
tame
goat
,
and
I
should
perish
at
last
for
mere
want
.
  
<EOS>
thus
my
fear
banish
all
my
religious
hope
;
all
that
former
confidence
in
God
,
which
be
found
upon
such
wonderful
experience
as
I
have
have
of
his
goodness
,
now
vanish
;
as
if
he
that
have
feed
me
by
miracle
hitherto
,
could
not
preserve
by
his
power
the
provision
which
he
have
make
for
me
by
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
I
reproach
myself
with
my
uneasiness
,
that
I
would
not
sow
any
more
corn
one
year
,
than
would
just
serve
me
till
the
next
season
,
as
if
no
accident
could
intervene
,
to
prevent
my
enjoy
the
crop
that
be
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
think
so
just
a
reproof
,
that
I
resolve
for
the
future
to
have
two
or
three
year
corn
beforehand
,
so
that
,
whatever
may
come
,
I
may
not
perish
for
want
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
how
strange
a
chequer
-
work
of
Providence
be
the
life
of
man
!
<EOS>
and
by
what
secret
differ
spring
be
the
affection
hurry
about
,
as
differ
circumstance
present
!
<EOS>
to
-
day
we
love
what
to
-
morrow
we
hate
;
to
-
day
we
seek
what
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
we
shun
;
to
-
day
we
desire
what
to
-
morrow
we
fear
;
<EOS>
nay
,
even
tremble
at
the
apprehension
of
.
<EOS>
this
be
exemplify
in
me
at
this
time
in
the
most
lively
manner
imaginable
;
for
I
,
whose
only
affliction
be
,
that
I
seem
banish
from
human
society
,
that
I
be
alone
,
circumscribe
by
the
boundless
ocean
,
cut
off
from
mankind
,
and
condemn
to
what
I
call
a
silent
life
;
that
I
be
as
one
whom
Heaven
think
not
worthy
to
be
number
among
the
living
,
or
to
appear
among
the
rest
of
his
creature
;
that
to
have
see
one
of
my
own
specie
,
would
have
seem
to
me
<EOS>
a
raise
me
from
death
to
life
,
and
the
great
blessing
that
Heaven
itself
,
next
to
the
supreme
blessing
of
salvation
,
could
bestow
;
I
say
,
that
I
should
now
tremble
at
the
very
apprehension
of
see
a
man
,
and
be
ready
to
sink
into
the
ground
,
at
but
the
shadow
,
or
silent
appearance
of
a
man
's
have
set
his
foot
on
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
uneven
state
of
human
life
;
and
it
afford
me
a
great
many
curious
speculation
afterwards
,
when
I
have
a
little
recover
<EOS>
my
first
surprise
<EOS>
:
I
consider
that
this
be
the
station
of
life
the
infinitely
wise
and
good
providence
of
God
have
determine
for
me
;
that
as
I
could
not
foresee
what
the
end
of
divine
wisdom
may
be
in
all
this
,
so
I
be
not
to
dispute
his
sovereignty
,
who
,
as
I
be
his
creature
,
have
an
undoubted
right
by
creation
to
govern
and
dispose
of
me
absolutely
as
he
think
fit
;
and
who
,
as
I
be
a
creature
who
have
offend
him
,
have
likewise
a
judicial
right
to
condemn
me
to
what
punishment
he
think
fit
;
and
that
it
be
my
part
to
submit
to
bear
his
indignation
,
because
I
have
sin
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
reflect
,
that
God
,
who
be
not
only
righteous
,
but
omnipotent
,
as
he
have
think
fit
thus
to
punish
and
afflict
me
,
so
he
be
able
to
deliver
me
;
that
if
he
do
not
think
fit
to
do
it
,
it
be
my
unquestioned
duty
to
resign
myself
absolutely
and
entirely
to
his
will
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
my
duty
also
<EOS>
to
hope
in
him
,
pray
to
him
,
and
quietly
to
attend
the
dictates
and
direction
of
his
daily
providence
.
  
<EOS>
these
thought
take
me
up
many
hour
,
day
,
nay
,
I
may
say
,
week
and
month
;
and
one
particular
effect
of
my
cogitation
on
this
occasion
I
can
not
omit
;
viz
.
<EOS>
one
morning
early
,
lie
in
my
bed
,
and
fill
with
thought
about
my
danger
from
the
appearance
of
savage
,
I
find
it
discompose
me
very
much
;
upon
which
those
word
of
the
scripture
come
into
my
thought
,
"
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
I
will
deliver
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
rise
cheerfully
out
of
my
bed
,
my
heart
be
not
only
comfort
,
but
I
be
guide
and
encourage
to
pray
earnestly
to
God
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
pray
,
I
take
up
my
Bible
,
and
open
it
to
read
,
the
first
word
that
present
to
me
be
,
"
wait
on
the
Lord
,
and
be
of
good
cheer
,
and
he
shall
strengthen
thy
heart
:
wait
,
I
say
,
on
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
comfort
this
give
me
;
and
in
return
,
I
thankfully
lay
down
the
book
,
and
be
no
more
sad
,
at
least
,
not
on
that
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
these
cogitation
,
apprehension
,
and
reflection
,
it
come
into
my
thought
one
day
,
that
all
this
may
be
a
mere
chimera
of
my
own
,
and
that
this
foot
may
be
the
print
of
my
own
foot
,
when
I
come
on
shore
from
my
boat
.
<EOS>
this
cheer
me
up
a
little
too
,
and
I
begin
to
persuade
myself
it
be
all
a
delusion
;
that
it
be
nothing
else
but
my
own
foot
;
and
why
may
not
I
come
that
way
from
the
boat
,
as
well
as
I
be
go
that
way
to
the
boat
?
<EOS>
again
,
I
consider
also
,
that
I
could
by
no
means
tell
for
certain
where
I
have
trod
,
and
where
I
have
not
;
and
that
if
at
last
this
be
only
the
print
of
my
own
foot
,
I
have
play
the
part
of
those
fool
,
who
strive
to
make
story
of
spectre
and
apparition
,
and
then
be
themselves
fright
at
them
more
than
any
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
begin
to
take
courage
,
and
to
peep
abroad
again
;
for
I
have
not
stir
out
of
my
castle
for
three
day
and
night
,
so
that
I
begin
to
starve
for
provision
;
for
I
have
little
or
nothing
within
door
,
but
some
barley
-
cake
and
water
.
<EOS>
then
I
know
that
my
goat
want
to
be
milk
too
,
which
usually
be
my
evening
diversion
;
and
the
poor
creature
be
in
great
pain
and
inconvenience
for
want
of
it
;
and
indeed
it
almost
spoil
some
of
them
,
and
almost
dry
up
their
milk
.
  
<EOS>
hearten
myself
therefore
with
the
belief
,
that
this
be
nothing
but
the
print
of
one
of
my
own
foot
<EOS>
(
and
so
I
may
be
truly
say
to
start
at
my
own
shadow
)
,
I
begin
to
go
abroad
again
,
and
go
to
my
country
-
house
to
milk
my
flock
:
but
to
see
with
what
fear
I
go
forward
,
how
often
I
look
behind
me
<EOS>
,
how
I
be
ready
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
lay
down
my
basket
,
and
run
for
my
life
;
it
would
have
make
any
one
have
think
I
be
haunt
with
an
evil
conscience
,
or
that
I
have
be
lately
most
terribly
frighted
;
and
so
indeed
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
go
down
thus
two
or
three
day
,
and
have
see
nothing
,
I
begin
to
be
a
little
bolder
,
and
to
think
there
be
really
nothing
in
it
<EOS>
but
my
own
imagination
;
but
I
could
not
persuade
myself
fully
of
this
,
till
I
should
go
down
to
the
shore
again
,
and
see
this
print
of
a
foot
,
and
measure
it
by
my
own
,
and
see
if
there
be
any
similitude
or
fitness
,
that
I
may
be
assure
it
be
my
own
foot
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
to
the
place
first
,
it
appear
evidently
to
me
,
that
when
I
lay
up
my
boat
,
I
could
not
possibly
be
on
shore
any
where
thereabout
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
when
I
come
to
measure
the
mark
with
my
own
foot
,
I
find
my
foot
not
so
large
by
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
both
these
thing
fill
my
head
with
new
imagination
,
and
give
me
the
vapour
again
to
the
high
degree
;
so
that
I
shake
with
cold
,
like
one
in
an
ague
,
and
I
go
home
again
,
fill
with
the
belief
,
that
some
man
or
man
have
be
on
shore
there
;
or
,
in
short
,
that
the
island
be
inhabit
,
and
I
may
be
surprised
before
I
be
aware
;
and
what
course
to
take
for
my
security
,
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
o
what
ridiculous
resolution
man
take
,
when
possess
with
fear
!
<EOS>
It
deprive
them
of
the
use
of
those
mean
which
reason
offer
for
their
relief
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
propose
to
myself
be
,
to
throw
down
my
enclosure
,
and
turn
all
my
tame
cattle
wild
into
the
wood
,
that
the
enemy
may
not
find
them
,
and
then
frequent
the
island
in
prospect
of
the
same
,
or
the
like
booty
;
then
to
the
simple
thing
of
dig
up
my
two
corn
field
,
that
they
may
not
find
such
a
grain
there
,
and
still
to
be
prompt
to
frequent
the
island
;
then
to
demolish
my
bower
and
tent
,
that
they
may
not
see
any
vestige
of
my
habitation
,
and
be
prompt
to
look
farther
,
in
order
to
find
out
the
person
inhabit
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
subject
of
the
first
night
's
cogitation
,
after
I
be
come
home
again
,
while
the
apprehension
which
have
so
over
-
run
my
mind
be
fresh
upon
me
,
and
my
head
be
full
of
vapour
,
as
above
.
<EOS>
thus
fear
of
danger
be
ten
thousand
time
more
terrifying
than
danger
itself
,
when
apparent
to
the
eye
;
and
,
we
find
the
burden
of
anxiety
great
by
much
than
the
evil
which
we
be
anxious
about
;
but
,
which
be
bad
than
all
this
,
I
have
not
that
relief
in
this
trouble
from
the
resignation
I
use
to
practise
,
that
I
hope
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
look
,
I
think
,
like
Saul
,
who
complain
not
only
that
the
Philistines
be
upon
him
,
but
that
God
have
forsake
him
;
for
I
do
not
now
take
due
way
to
compose
my
mind
,
by
cry
to
God
in
my
distress
,
and
rest
upon
his
providence
,
as
I
have
do
before
,
for
my
defence
and
deliverance
;
which
if
I
have
do
,
I
have
,
at
least
,
be
more
cheerfully
support
under
this
new
surprise
,
and
perhaps
carry
through
it
with
more
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
this
confusion
of
my
thought
keep
me
wake
all
night
;
but
in
the
morning
I
fall
asleep
,
and
have
by
the
amusement
of
my
mind
be
,
as
it
be
,
tired
,
and
my
spirit
exhaust
,
I
sleep
very
soundly
,
and
I
awake
much
better
compose
than
I
have
ever
be
before
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
begin
to
think
sedately
;
and
,
upon
the
utmost
debate
with
myself
,
I
conclude
,
that
this
island
,
which
be
so
exceed
pleasant
,
fruitful
,
and
no
farther
from
the
main
land
than
as
I
have
see
,
be
not
so
entirely
abandon
as
I
may
imagine
:
that
although
there
be
no
state
inhabitant
who
live
on
the
spot
;
yet
that
there
may
sometimes
come
boat
off
from
the
shore
,
who
either
with
design
,
or
perhaps
never
but
when
they
be
drive
by
cross
wind
,
may
come
to
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
that
I
have
live
here
fifteen
year
now
,
and
have
not
meet
with
the
least
-
shadow
or
figure
of
any
people
before
;
and
that
if
at
any
time
they
should
be
drive
here
,
it
be
probable
<EOS>
they
go
away
again
as
soon
as
ever
<EOS>
they
could
,
see
they
have
never
think
fit
to
fix
there
upon
any
occasion
,
to
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
most
I
could
suggest
any
danger
from
,
be
,
from
any
such
casual
accidental
landing
of
straggle
people
from
the
main
,
who
,
as
it
be
likely
,
if
they
be
drive
hither
,
be
here
against
their
will
;
so
they
make
no
stay
here
,
but
go
off
again
with
all
possible
speed
,
seldom
stay
one
night
on
shore
,
lest
they
should
not
have
the
help
of
the
tide
and
daylight
back
again
;
and
that
therefore
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
consider
of
some
safe
retreat
,
in
case
I
should
see
any
savage
land
upon
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
begin
sorely
to
repent
that
I
have
dig
my
cave
so
large
,
as
to
bring
a
door
through
again
,
which
door
,
as
I
say
,
come
out
beyond
where
my
fortification
join
to
the
rock
.
<EOS>
upon
maturely
consider
this
,
therefore
,
I
resolve
to
draw
me
a
second
fortification
,
in
the
manner
of
a
semicircle
,
at
a
distance
from
my
wall
,
just
where
I
have
plant
a
double
row
of
tree
about
twelve
year
before
,
of
which
I
make
mention
:
these
tree
have
be
plant
so
thick
before
,
there
want
but
a
few
pile
to
be
drive
between
them
,
that
they
should
be
thick
and
strong
,
and
my
wall
would
be
soon
finish
.
  
<EOS>
so
that
I
have
now
a
double
wall
,
and
my
outer
wall
be
thicken
with
piece
of
timber
,
old
cable
,
and
every
thing
I
could
think
of
to
make
it
strong
;
have
in
it
seven
little
hole
,
about
as
big
as
I
may
put
my
arm
out
at
.
<EOS>
in
the
inside
of
this
I
thicken
my
wall
to
about
ten
foot
thick
,
continually
bring
earth
out
of
my
cave
,
and
lay
it
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
,
and
walk
upon
it
;
and
through
the
seven
hole
I
contrive
to
plant
the
musket
,
of
which
I
take
notice
that
I
get
seven
on
shore
out
of
the
ship
;
these
,
I
say
,
I
plant
like
my
cannon
,
and
fit
them
into
frame
that
hold
them
like
a
carriage
,
that
so
I
could
fire
all
the
seven
gun
in
two
minute
time
.
<EOS>
this
wall
I
be
many
a
weary
month
in
finishing
,
and
yet
never
think
myself
safe
till
it
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
I
stick
all
the
ground
without
my
wall
,
for
a
great
way
every
way
,
as
full
with
stake
or
stick
of
the
osi
-
like
wood
,
which
I
find
so
apt
to
grow
,
as
they
could
well
stand
;
insomuch
that
I
believe
I
may
set
in
near
twenty
thousand
of
them
,
leave
a
pretty
large
space
between
them
and
my
wall
,
that
I
may
have
room
to
see
an
enemy
,
and
they
may
have
no
shelter
from
the
young
tree
,
if
they
attempt
to
approach
my
outer
wall
.
  
<EOS>
thus
in
two
year
time
I
have
a
thick
grove
;
and
in
five
or
six
year
time
I
have
a
wood
before
my
dwelling
,
grow
so
monstrous
thick
and
strong
,
that
it
be
indeed
perfectly
impassable
;
and
no
man
of
what
kind
soever
would
ever
imagine
that
there
be
any
thing
beyond
it
,
much
less
an
habitation
:
as
for
the
way
I
propose
myself
to
go
in
and
out
(
for
I
leave
no
avenue
)
,
it
be
by
set
two
ladder
;
one
to
a
part
of
the
rock
which
be
low
,
and
then
break
in
,
and
leave
room
to
place
another
ladder
upon
that
;
so
when
the
two
ladder
be
take
down
,
no
man
live
could
come
down
to
me
without
mischiefe
himself
;
and
if
they
have
come
down
,
they
be
still
on
the
outside
of
my
outer
wall
.
  
<EOS>
thus
I
take
all
the
measure
human
prudence
could
suggest
for
my
own
preservation
;
and
it
will
be
see
at
length
,
that
they
be
not
altogether
without
just
reason
;
though
I
foresee
nothing
at
that
time
more
than
my
mere
fear
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
,
I
be
not
altogether
careless
of
my
other
affair
;
for
I
have
a
great
concern
upon
me
for
my
little
herd
of
goat
;
they
be
not
only
a
present
supply
to
me
upon
every
occasion
,
and
begin
to
be
sufficient
for
me
,
without
the
expense
of
powder
and
shoot
,
but
also
abate
the
fatigue
of
my
hunting
after
the
wild
one
;
and
I
be
loath
to
lose
the
advantage
of
them
,
and
to
have
them
all
to
nurse
up
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
purpose
,
after
long
consideration
,
I
could
think
but
of
two
way
to
preserve
them
:
<EOS>
one
be
to
find
another
convenient
place
to
dig
a
cave
under
ground
,
and
to
drive
them
into
it
every
night
;
and
the
other
be
to
enclose
two
or
three
little
bit
of
land
,
remote
from
one
another
,
and
as
much
conceal
as
I
could
,
where
I
may
keep
about
half
a
dozen
young
goat
in
each
place
;
so
that
if
any
disaster
happen
to
the
flock
in
general
,
I
may
be
able
to
raise
them
again
with
little
trouble
and
time
:
and
<EOS>
this
,
though
it
would
require
a
great
deal
of
time
and
labour
,
I
think
be
the
most
rational
design
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
spend
some
time
,
to
find
out
the
most
retired
part
of
the
island
;
and
I
pitch
upon
one
,
which
be
as
private
indeed
as
my
heart
could
wish
;
for
it
be
a
little
damp
piece
of
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
hollow
and
thick
wood
,
where
,
as
be
observe
,
I
almost
lose
myself
once
before
,
endeavour
to
come
back
that
way
from
the
eastern
part
of
the
island
:
here
I
find
a
clear
piece
of
land
near
three
acre
,
so
surround
with
wood
,
that
it
be
almost
an
enclosure
by
nature
;
at
least
it
do
not
want
near
so
much
labour
to
make
it
so
,
as
the
other
piece
of
ground
I
have
work
so
hard
at
.
  
<EOS>
I
immediately
go
to
work
with
this
piece
of
ground
,
and
in
less
than
a
month
's
time
I
have
so
fence
it
round
,
that
my
flock
or
herd
,
call
it
which
you
please
,
which
be
not
so
wild
now
as
at
first
they
may
be
suppose
to
be
,
be
well
enough
secure
in
it
.
<EOS>
so
without
any
farther
delay
,
I
remove
ten
she
-
goat
and
two
he
-
goat
to
this
piece
;
and
when
there
,
I
continue
to
perfect
the
fence
,
till
I
have
make
it
as
secure
as
the
other
,
which
,
however
,
I
do
at
more
leisure
,
and
it
take
me
up
more
time
by
a
great
deal
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
labour
I
be
at
the
expense
of
,
purely
from
my
apprehension
on
the
account
of
the
print
of
a
man
's
foot
which
I
have
see
;
for
as
yet
,
I
never
see
any
human
creature
come
near
the
island
,
and
I
have
now
live
two
year
under
these
uneasiness
,
which
indeed
make
my
life
much
less
comfortable
than
it
be
before
;
as
may
well
be
imagine
,
by
any
who
know
what
it
be
to
live
in
the
constant
snare
of
the
fear
of
man
;
and
this
I
must
observe
with
grief
too
,
that
the
discomposure
of
my
mind
have
too
great
impression
also
upon
the
religious
part
of
my
thought
;
for
the
dread
and
terror
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
savage
and
cannibal
lie
so
upon
my
spirit
,
that
I
seldom
find
myself
in
a
due
temper
for
application
to
my
maker
;
at
least
,
not
with
the
sedate
calmness
and
resignation
of
soul
which
I
be
will
not
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
rather
pray
to
God
as
under
great
affliction
and
pressure
of
mind
,
surround
with
danger
,
and
in
expectation
every
night
of
be
murder
and
devour
before
the
morning
;
and
I
must
testify
from
my
experience
,
that
a
temper
of
peace
,
thankfulness
,
love
,
and
affection
,
be
much
more
the
proper
frame
for
prayer
than
that
of
terror
and
discomposure
;
and
that
under
the
dread
of
mischief
impending
,
a
man
be
no
more
fit
for
a
comfort
performance
of
the
duty
of
pray
to
God
,
than
he
be
for
repentance
on
a
sick
bed
;
for
these
discomposure
affect
the
mind
as
the
other
do
the
body
;
and
the
discomposure
of
the
mind
must
necessarily
be
as
great
a
disability
as
that
of
the
body
,
and
much
great
;
pray
to
God
be
properly
an
act
of
the
mind
,
not
of
the
body
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
go
on
:
after
I
have
thus
secure
one
part
of
my
little
living
stock
,
I
go
about
the
whole
island
,
search
for
another
private
place
,
to
make
such
another
deposit
<EOS>
;
when
wander
more
to
the
west
point
of
the
island
than
I
have
ever
do
yet
,
and
look
out
to
sea
,
I
think
I
see
a
boat
upon
the
sea
at
a
great
distance
;
I
have
find
a
perspective
glass
or
two
in
one
of
the
seaman
's
chest
,
which
I
save
out
of
our
ship
;
but
I
have
it
not
about
me
,
and
this
be
so
remote
,
that
I
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
it
,
though
I
look
at
it
till
my
eye
be
not
able
to
look
any
longer
:
whether
it
be
a
boat
,
or
not
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
as
I
descend
from
the
hill
,
I
could
see
no
more
of
it
,
so
I
give
it
over
;
only
I
resolve
to
go
no
more
without
a
perspective
glass
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
come
down
the
hill
,
to
the
end
of
the
island
,
where
indeed
I
have
never
be
before
,
I
be
presently
convince
,
that
the
see
the
print
of
a
man
's
foot
,
be
not
such
a
strange
thing
in
the
island
as
I
imagine
;
and
,
but
that
it
be
a
special
providence
that
I
be
cast
upon
the
side
of
the
island
where
the
savage
never
come
,
I
should
easily
have
know
,
that
nothing
be
more
frequent
than
for
the
canoe
from
the
main
,
when
,
they
happen
to
be
a
little
too
far
out
at
sea
,
to
shoot
over
to
that
side
of
the
island
for
harbour
;
likewise
,
as
they
often
meet
,
and
fight
in
their
canoe
,
the
victor
,
have
take
any
prisoner
,
would
bring
them
over
to
this
shore
,
where
,
accord
to
their
dreadful
custom
,
be
all
cannibal
,
they
would
kill
and
eat
them
:
of
which
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
come
down
the
hill
to
the
shore
,
as
I
say
above
,
be
the
S.W.
point
of
the
island
,
I
be
perfectly
confound
and
amazed
;
nor
be
it
possible
for
me
to
express
the
horror
of
my
mind
,
at
see
the
shore
spread
with
skull
,
hand
,
foot
,
and
other
bone
of
human
body
;
and
particularly
I
observe
a
place
where
there
have
be
a
fire
make
,
and
a
circle
dig
in
the
earth
,
like
a
cock
-
pit
,
where
it
be
suppose
the
savage
wretch
have
sit
down
to
their
inhuman
feasting
upon
the
body
of
their
fellow
-
creature
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
astonished
with
the
sight
of
these
thing
<EOS>
,
that
I
entertain
no
notion
of
any
danger
to
myself
from
it
,
for
a
long
while
;
all
my
apprehension
be
bury
in
the
thought
of
such
a
pitch
of
inhuman
,
hellish
brutality
,
and
the
horror
of
the
degeneracy
of
human
nature
;
which
,
though
I
have
hear
of
often
,
yet
I
never
have
so
near
a
view
of
before
:
in
short
,
I
turn
away
my
face
from
the
horrid
spectacle
;
my
stomach
grow
sick
,
and
I
be
just
at
the
point
of
fainting
,
when
nature
discharge
the
disorder
from
my
stomach
,
and
,
have
vomit
with
an
uncommon
violence
,
I
be
a
little
relieved
,
but
could
not
bear
to
stay
in
the
place
a
moment
;
so
I
get
me
up
the
hill
again
with
all
the
speed
I
could
,
and
walk
on
towards
my
own
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
a
little
out
of
that
part
of
the
island
,
I
stand
still
a
while
as
amazed
;
and
then
recover
myself
,
I
look
up
with
the
utmost
affection
of
my
soul
,
and
,
with
a
flood
of
tear
in
my
eye
,
give
God
thank
,
that
have
cast
my
first
lot
in
a
part
of
the
world
where
I
be
distinguish
from
such
dreadful
creature
as
these
;
and
that
though
I
have
esteem
my
present
condition
very
miserable
,
have
yet
give
me
so
many
comfort
in
it
,
that
I
have
still
more
to
give
thank
for
than
to
complain
of
;
and
this
above
all
,
that
I
have
,
even
in
this
miserable
condition
,
be
comfort
with
the
knowledge
of
himself
,
and
the
hope
of
his
blessing
,
which
be
a
felicity
more
than
sufficiently
equivalent
to
all
the
misery
which
I
have
suffer
,
or
could
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
frame
of
thankfulness
I
go
home
to
my
castle
,
and
begin
to
be
much
easy
now
,
as
to
the
safety
of
my
circumstance
,
than
ever
I
be
before
;
for
I
observe
,
that
these
wretch
never
come
to
this
island
in
search
of
what
they
could
get
;
perhaps
not
seek
,
not
want
,
or
not
expect
,
any
thing
here
,
and
have
often
,
no
doubt
,
be
up
in
the
covered
woody
part
of
it
,
without
find
any
thing
to
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
be
here
now
almost
eighteen
year
,
and
never
see
the
least
footstep
of
a
human
creature
there
before
;
and
may
be
here
eighteen
more
as
entirely
conceal
as
I
be
now
,
if
I
do
not
discover
myself
to
them
,
which
I
have
no
manner
of
occasion
to
do
,
it
be
my
only
business
to
keep
myself
entirely
conceal
where
I
be
,
unless
I
find
a
well
sort
of
creature
than
cannibal
to
make
myself
known
to
.
  
<EOS>
yet
I
entertain
such
an
abhorrence
of
the
savage
<EOS>
wretch
that
I
have
be
speak
of
,
and
of
the
wretched
inhuman
custom
of
their
devour
and
eat
one
another
up
,
that
I
continue
pensive
and
sad
,
and
keep
close
within
my
own
circle
for
almost
two
year
after
this
:
<EOS>
when
I
say
my
own
circle
,
I
mean
by
it
my
three
plantation
,
viz
.
<EOS>
my
castle
,
my
country
-
seat
,
which
I
call
my
bower
,
and
my
enclosure
in
the
wood
;
nor
do
I
look
after
this
for
any
other
use
than
as
an
enclosure
for
my
goat
;
for
the
aversion
which
nature
give
me
to
these
hellish
wretch
be
such
,
that
I
be
as
fearful
of
see
them
as
of
seeing
,
the
devil
himself
;
nor
do
I
so
much
as
go
to
look
after
my
boat
in
all
this
time
,
but
begin
rather
to
think
of
make
me
another
;
for
I
could
not
think
of
ever
make
any
more
attempt
to
bring
the
other
boat
round
the
island
to
me
,
lest
I
should
meet
with
some
of
those
creature
at
sea
,
in
which
,
if
I
have
happen
to
have
fall
into
their
hand
,
I
know
what
would
have
be
my
lot
.
  
<EOS>
time
,
however
,
and
the
satisfaction
I
have
,
that
I
be
in
no
danger
of
be
discover
by
these
people
,
begin
to
wear
off
my
uneasiness
about
them
;
and
I
begin
to
live
just
in
the
same
compose
manner
as
before
;
only
with
this
difference
,
that
I
use
more
caution
,
and
keep
my
eye
more
about
me
than
I
do
before
,
lest
I
should
happen
to
be
see
by
any
of
them
;
and
particularly
,
I
be
more
cautious
of
fire
my
gun
,
lest
any
of
them
on
the
island
should
happen
to
hear
it
;
and
it
be
therefore
a
very
good
providence
to
me
,
that
I
have
furnish
myself
with
a
tame
breed
of
goat
,
that
I
have
no
need
to
hunt
any
more
about
the
wood
,
or
shoot
at
them
;
and
if
I
do
catch
any
more
of
them
after
this
,
it
be
by
trap
and
snare
,
as
I
have
do
before
;
so
that
for
two
year
after
this
,
I
believe
I
never
fire
my
gun
once
off
,
though
I
never
go
out
without
it
;
and
,
which
be
more
,
as
I
have
save
three
pistol
out
of
the
ship
,
I
always
carry
them
out
with
me
,
or
at
least
two
of
them
,
stick
them
in
my
goat
-
skin
belt
<EOS>
:
I
likewise
furbish
up
one
of
the
great
cutlass
that
I
have
out
of
the
ship
,
and
make
me
a
belt
to
put
it
in
also
;
so
that
I
be
now
a
most
formidable
fellow
to
look
at
when
I
go
abroad
,
if
you
add
to
the
former
description
of
myself
,
the
particular
of
two
pistol
,
and
a
great
broad
-
sword
,
hang
at
my
side
in
a
belt
,
but
without
a
scabbard
.
  
<EOS>
thing
go
on
thus
,
as
I
have
say
,
for
some
time
,
I
seem
,
except
these
caution
,
to
be
reduce
to
my
former
calm
sedate
way
of
living
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
tend
to
shew
me
more
and
more
how
far
<EOS>
my
condition
be
from
be
miserable
,
compare
to
some
other
;
nay
,
to
many
other
particular
of
life
,
which
it
may
have
please
God
to
have
make
my
lot
.
<EOS>
It
put
me
upon
reflect
,
how
little
repine
there
would
be
among
mankind
,
at
any
condition
of
life
,
if
people
would
rather
compare
their
condition
with
those
that
be
bad
,
in
order
to
be
thankful
,
than
be
always
compare
them
with
those
which
be
well
,
to
assist
their
murmuring
and
complaining
.
  
<EOS>
as
in
my
present
condition
there
be
not
really
many
thing
which
I
want
,
so
<EOS>
indeed
I
think
that
the
fright
I
have
be
in
about
these
savage
wretch
,
and
the
concern
I
have
be
in
for
my
own
preservation
,
have
take
off
the
edge
of
my
invention
for
my
own
convenience
,
and
I
have
drop
a
good
design
,
which
I
have
once
bent
my
thought
upon
;
and
that
be
,
to
try
if
I
could
not
make
some
of
my
barley
into
malt
,
and
then
try
to
brew
myself
some
beer
:
this
be
really
a
whimsical
thought
,
and
I
reprove
myself
often
for
the
simplicity
of
it
;
for
I
presently
see
there
would
be
the
want
of
several
thing
necessary
to
the
make
my
beer
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
supply
;
as
,
first
,
cask
to
preserve
it
in
,
which
be
a
thing
that
,
as
I
have
observe
already
,
I
could
never
compass
;
no
,
though
I
spend
not
many
day
,
but
week
,
nay
month
,
in
attempt
it
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
I
have
no
hop
to
make
it
keep
,
no
yeast
to
make
it
work
,
no
copper
or
kettle
to
make
it
boil
;
and
yet
,
have
not
all
these
thing
intervene
<EOS>
,
I
mean
the
fright
and
terror
<EOS>
I
be
in
about
the
savage
<EOS>
,
I
have
undertake
it
,
and
perhaps
bring
it
to
pass
too
;
for
I
seldom
give
any
thing
over
without
accomplish
it
,
when
I
once
have
it
in
my
head
enough
to
begin
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
invention
now
run
quite
another
way
;
for
night
and
day
I
could
think
of
nothing
,
but
how
I
may
destroy
some
of
these
monster
in
their
cruel
bloody
entertainment
,
and
,
if
possible
,
save
the
victim
they
should
bring
hither
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
It
would
take
up
a
large
volume
than
this
whole
work
be
intend
to
be
,
to
set
down
all
the
contrivance
I
hatch
,
or
rather
brood
upon
in
my
thought
,
for
the
destroy
these
creature
,
or
at
least
frightening
them
,
so
as
to
prevent
their
come
hither
any
more
;
but
all
be
abortive
;
nothing
could
be
possible
to
take
effect
,
unless
I
be
to
be
there
to
do
it
myself
;
and
what
could
one
man
do
among
them
,
when
perhaps
there
may
be
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
together
,
with
their
dart
,
or
their
bow
and
arrow
,
with
which
they
could
shoot
as
true
to
a
mark
as
I
could
with
my
gun
?
  
<EOS>
sometimes
I
contrive
to
dig
a
hole
under
the
place
where
they
make
their
fire
,
and
put
in
five
or
six
pound
of
gunpowder
,
which
,
when
they
kindle
their
fire
,
would
consequently
take
fire
,
and
blow
up
all
that
be
near
it
;
but
,
as
in
the
first
place
I
should
be
very
loath
to
waste
so
much
powder
upon
them
,
my
store
be
now
within
the
quantity
of
a
barrel
,
so
neither
could
I
be
sure
of
its
go
off
at
any
certain
time
,
when
it
may
surprise
them
;
and
,
at
best
,
that
it
would
do
little
more
than
just
blow
the
fire
about
their
ear
,
and
fright
them
,
but
not
sufficient
to
make
them
forsake
the
place
;
so
I
lay
it
aside
,
and
then
propose
,
that
I
would
place
myself
in
ambush
in
some
convenient
place
,
with
my
three
gun
all
double
-
loaded
,
and
in
the
middle
of
their
bloody
ceremony
let
fly
at
them
,
when
I
should
be
sure
to
kill
or
wound
perhaps
two
or
three
at
every
shoot
;
and
then
fall
in
upon
them
with
my
three
pistol
,
and
my
sword
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
,
if
there
be
twenty
,
I
should
kill
them
all
:
this
fancy
please
my
thought
for
some
week
,
and
I
be
so
full
of
it
that
I
often
dream
of
it
;
and
sometimes
,
that
I
be
just
go
to
let
fly
at
them
in
my
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
so
far
with
it
in
my
indignation
,
that
I
employ
myself
several
day
to
find
out
proper
place
to
put
myself
in
ambuscade
,
as
I
say
,
to
watch
for
them
;
and
I
go
frequently
to
the
place
itself
,
which
be
now
grow
more
familiar
to
me
;
and
especially
while
my
mind
be
thus
fill
with
thought
of
revenge
,
and
of
a
bloody
put
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
to
the
sword
,
as
I
may
call
it
;
but
the
horror
I
have
at
the
place
,
and
at
the
signal
of
the
barbarous
wretch
devour
one
another
,
abate
my
malice
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
at
length
I
find
a
place
in
the
side
of
the
hill
,
where
I
be
satisfied
<EOS>
I
may
securely
wait
till
I
see
any
of
the
boat
come
,
and
may
then
,
even
before
they
would
be
ready
to
come
on
shore
,
convey
myself
unseen
into
thicket
of
tree
,
in
one
of
which
there
be
an
hollow
large
enough
to
conceal
me
entirely
;
and
where
I
may
sit
,
and
observe
all
their
bloody
doing
,
and
take
my
full
aim
at
their
head
,
when
they
be
so
close
together
,
as
that
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
that
I
should
miss
my
shoot
,
or
that
I
could
fail
wound
three
or
four
of
them
at
the
first
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
place
then
I
resolve
to
fix
my
design
;
and
accordingly
I
prepare
two
musket
and
my
ordinary
fowling
-
piece
.
<EOS>
the
two
musket
I
load
with
a
brace
of
slug
each
,
and
four
or
five
small
bullet
,
about
the
size
of
pistol
-
bullet
,
and
the
fowling
-
piece
<EOS>
I
load
with
near
an
handful
of
swan
-
shoot
,
of
the
large
size
;
I
also
load
my
pistol
with
about
four
bullet
each
:
and
in
this
posture
,
well
provide
with
ammunition
for
a
second
and
third
charge
,
I
prepare
myself
for
my
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
thus
lay
the
scheme
for
my
design
,
and
in
my
imagination
put
it
in
practice
,
I
continually
make
my
tour
every
morning
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
which
be
from
my
castle
,
as
I
call
it
,
about
three
mile
or
more
,
to
see
if
I
could
observe
any
boat
upon
the
sea
,
come
near
the
island
,
or
stand
over
towards
it
;
but
I
begin
to
tire
of
this
hard
duty
,
after
I
have
for
two
or
three
month
constantly
keep
my
watch
;
but
come
always
back
without
any
discovery
,
there
have
not
in
all
that
time
be
the
least
appearance
,
not
only
on
or
near
the
shore
,
but
not
on
the
whole
ocean
,
so
far
as
my
eye
or
glass
could
reach
every
way
.
  
<EOS>
as
long
as
I
keep
up
my
daily
tour
to
the
hill
to
look
out
,
so
long
also
I
keep
up
the
vigour
of
my
design
,
and
my
spirit
seem
to
be
all
the
while
in
a
suitable
frame
for
so
outrageous
an
execution
,
as
the
kill
twenty
or
thirty
naked
savage
for
an
offence
,
which
I
have
not
at
all
enter
into
a
discussion
of
in
my
thought
,
any
further
than
my
passion
be
at
first
fire
by
the
horror
I
conceive
at
the
unnatural
custom
of
the
people
of
that
country
,
who
,
it
seem
,
have
be
suffer
by
Providence
,
in
his
wise
disposition
of
the
world
,
to
have
no
other
guide
than
that
of
their
own
abominable
and
vitiated
passion
;
and
consequently
be
leave
,
and
perhaps
have
be
for
some
age
,
to
act
such
horrid
thing
,
and
receive
such
dreadful
custom
,
as
nothing
but
nature
,
entirely
abandon
of
Heaven
,
and
actuate
by
some
hellish
degeneracy
,
could
have
run
them
into
;
but
now
,
when
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
begin
to
be
weary
of
the
fruitless
excursion
which
I
have
make
so
long
,
and
so
far
,
every
morning
in
vain
;
so
my
opinion
of
the
action
itself
begin
to
alter
,
and
I
begin
,
with
cool
and
calm
thought
,
to
consider
what
it
be
I
be
go
to
engage
in
;
what
authority
or
call
I
have
to
pretend
to
be
judge
and
executioner
upon
these
man
as
criminal
,
whom
Heaven
have
think
fit
for
so
many
age
to
suffer
,
unpunished
,
to
go
on
,
and
to
be
,
as
it
be
,
the
executioner
of
his
judgment
upon
one
another
;
also
,
how
far
these
people
be
offender
against
me
,
and
what
right
I
have
to
engage
in
the
quarrel
of
that
blood
,
which
they
shed
promiscuously
one
upon
another
.
<EOS>
I
debate
this
very
often
with
myself
thus
:
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
what
God
himself
judge
in
this
particular
case
?
<EOS>
It
be
certain
these
people
do
not
commit
this
as
a
crime
;
it
be
not
against
their
own
conscience
reprove
,
or
their
light
reproach
them
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
know
it
to
be
an
offence
,
and
then
commit
it
in
defiance
of
divine
justice
,
as
we
do
in
almost
all
the
sin
we
commit
.
<EOS>
They
think
it
no
more
a
crime
to
kill
a
captive
take
in
war
,
than
we
do
to
kill
an
ox
;
nor
to
eat
human
flesh
,
than
we
do
to
eat
mutton
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
consider
this
a
little
,
it
follow
necessarily
,
that
I
be
certainly
in
the
wrong
in
it
;
that
these
people
be
not
murderer
in
the
sense
that
I
have
before
condemn
them
in
my
thought
,
any
more
than
those
Christians
be
murderer
,
who
often
put
to
death
the
prisoner
take
in
battle
;
or
more
frequently
,
upon
many
occasion
,
put
whole
troop
of
man
to
the
sword
,
without
give
quarter
,
though
they
throw
down
their
arm
and
submit
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
it
occur
to
me
,
that
albeit
the
usage
they
give
one
another
be
thus
brutish
and
inhuman
,
yet
it
be
really
nothing
to
me
:
these
people
have
do
me
no
injury
:
that
if
they
attempt
me
,
or
I
see
it
necessary
for
my
immediate
preservation
to
fall
upon
them
,
something
may
be
say
for
it
;
but
that
I
be
yet
out
of
their
power
,
and
they
have
really
no
knowledge
of
me
,
and
consequently
no
design
upon
me
;
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
just
for
me
to
fall
upon
them
:
that
this
would
justify
the
conduct
of
the
Spaniards
,
in
all
their
barbarity
practise
in
America
,
where
they
destroy
million
of
these
people
,
who
,
however
they
be
idolater
and
barbarian
,
and
have
several
bloody
and
barbarous
rite
in
these
custom
,
such
as
sacrifice
human
body
to
their
idol
,
be
yet
,
as
to
the
Spaniards
,
very
innocent
people
;
and
that
the
root
them
out
of
the
country
be
speak
of
with
the
utmost
abhorrence
and
detestation
,
even
by
the
Spaniards
themselves
,
at
this
time
,
and
by
all
other
christian
nation
of
Europe
,
as
a
mere
butchery
,
a
bloody
and
unnatural
piece
of
cruelty
,
unjustifiable
either
to
God
or
man
;
and
such
,
as
for
which
the
very
name
of
a
Spaniard
be
reckon
to
be
frightful
and
terrible
to
all
people
of
humanity
,
or
of
christian
compassion
:
as
if
the
kingdom
of
Spain
be
particularly
eminent
for
the
product
of
a
race
of
man
,
who
be
without
principle
of
tenderness
,
or
the
common
bowel
of
pity
to
the
miserable
,
which
be
reckon
to
be
a
mark
of
a
generous
temper
in
the
mind
.
  
<EOS>
these
consideration
really
put
me
to
a
pause
,
and
to
a
kind
of
a
full
stop
;
and
I
begin
by
little
and
little
to
be
off
of
my
design
,
and
to
conclude
I
have
take
a
wrong
measure
in
my
resolution
to
attack
the
savage
;
that
it
be
not
my
business
to
meddle
with
them
,
unless
they
first
attack
me
,
and
this
<EOS>
it
be
my
business
,
if
possible
,
to
prevent
;
but
that
,
if
I
be
discover
and
attack
,
then
I
know
my
duty
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
I
argue
with
myself
that
this
really
be
the
way
not
to
deliver
myself
,
but
entirely
to
ruin
and
destroy
myself
;
for
unless
I
be
sure
to
kill
every
one
that
not
only
should
be
on
shore
at
that
time
,
but
that
should
ever
come
on
shore
afterwards
,
if
but
one
of
them
escape
to
tell
their
country
-
people
what
have
happen
,
they
would
come
over
again
by
thousand
to
revenge
the
death
of
their
fellow
;
and
I
should
only
bring
upon
myself
a
certain
destruction
,
which
at
present
I
have
no
manner
of
occasion
for
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
conclude
,
that
neither
in
principle
nor
in
policy
,
I
ought
one
way
or
other
to
concern
myself
in
this
affair
:
that
my
business
be
,
by
all
possible
mean
to
conceal
myself
from
them
,
and
not
to
leave
the
least
signal
to
them
to
guess
by
,
that
there
be
any
live
creature
upon
the
island
,
I
mean
of
human
shape
.
  
<EOS>
religion
join
in
with
this
prudential
,
and
I
be
convince
now
many
way
that
I
be
perfectly
out
of
my
duty
,
when
I
be
lay
all
my
bloody
scheme
for
the
destruction
of
innocent
creature
<EOS>
,
I
mean
innocent
as
to
me
;
as
to
the
crime
they
be
guilty
of
towards
one
another
,
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
;
they
be
national
punishment
to
make
a
just
retribution
for
national
offence
;
and
to
bring
public
judgment
upon
those
who
offend
in
a
public
manner
,
by
such
way
as
good
please
God
.
  
<EOS>
this
appear
so
clear
to
me
now
,
that
nothing
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
,
than
that
I
have
not
be
suffer
to
do
a
thing
which
I
now
see
so
much
reason
to
believe
would
have
be
no
less
a
sin
than
that
of
wilful
murder
,
if
I
have
commit
it
;
and
I
give
most
humble
thank
on
my
knee
to
God
,
that
have
thus
deliver
me
from
blood
-
guiltiness
;
beseech
him
to
grant
me
the
protection
of
his
Providence
,
that
I
may
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
barbarian
;
or
that
I
may
not
lay
my
hand
upon
them
,
unless
I
have
a
more
clear
call
from
Heaven
to
do
it
,
in
defence
of
my
own
life
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
disposition
I
continue
for
near
a
year
after
this
:
and
so
far
be
I
from
desire
an
occasion
for
fall
upon
these
wretch
,
that
in
all
that
time
I
never
once
go
up
the
hill
to
see
whether
there
be
any
of
them
in
sight
,
or
to
know
whether
any
of
them
have
be
on
shore
there
,
or
not
;
that
I
may
not
be
tempt
to
renew
any
of
my
contrivance
against
them
,
or
be
provoke
,
by
any
advantage
which
may
present
itself
,
to
fall
upon
them
;
only
this
I
do
,
I
go
and
remove
my
boat
,
which
I
have
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
and
carry
it
down
to
the
east
end
of
the
whole
island
,
where
I
run
it
into
a
little
cove
which
I
find
under
some
high
rock
,
and
where
I
know
,
by
reason
of
the
current
,
the
savage
durst
not
,
at
least
would
not
,
come
with
their
boat
upon
any
account
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
with
my
boat
I
carry
away
every
thing
that
I
have
leave
there
belong
to
her
,
though
not
necessary
for
the
bare
go
thither
;
viz
.
<EOS>
a
mast
and
sail
,
which
I
have
make
for
her
,
and
a
thing
like
an
anchor
,
but
indeed
which
could
not
be
call
either
anchor
or
grapple
<EOS>
;
however
,
it
be
the
good
I
could
make
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
all
these
I
remove
,
that
there
may
not
be
the
least
shadow
of
any
discovery
,
or
any
appearance
of
any
boat
,
or
of
any
habitation
upon
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
,
I
keep
myself
,
as
I
say
,
more
retired
than
ever
,
and
seldom
go
from
my
cell
,
other
than
upon
my
constant
employment
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
milk
my
she
-
goat
,
and
manage
my
little
flock
in
the
wood
,
which
,
as
it
be
quite
on
the
other
part
of
the
island
,
be
quite
out
of
danger
:
for
certain
it
be
,
that
these
savage
people
,
who
sometimes
haunt
this
island
,
never
come
with
any
thought
of
find
any
thing
here
,
and
consequently
never
wander
off
from
the
coast
;
and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
they
may
have
be
several
time
on
shore
,
after
my
apprehension
of
them
have
make
me
cautious
,
as
well
as
before
;
and
indeed
I
look
back
with
some
horror
upon
the
thought
of
what
my
condition
would
have
be
,
if
I
have
chop
upon
them
,
and
be
discover
before
that
,
when
naked
and
unarmed
,
except
with
one
gun
,
and
that
load
often
only
with
small
shot
.
<EOS>
I
walk
every
where
,
peep
and
peer
about
the
island
,
to
see
what
I
could
get
:
what
a
surprise
should
I
have
be
in
,
if
,
when
I
discover
the
print
of
a
man
's
foot
,
I
have
instead
of
that
see
fifteen
or
twenty
savage
,
and
find
them
pursue
me
,
and
,
by
the
swiftness
of
their
running
,
no
possibility
of
my
escape
them
!
  
<EOS>
the
thought
of
this
sometimes
sink
my
very
soul
within
me
,
and
distress
my
mind
so
much
,
that
I
could
not
soon
recover
it
;
to
think
what
I
should
have
do
,
and
how
I
not
only
should
not
have
be
able
to
resist
them
,
but
even
should
not
have
have
presence
of
mind
enough
to
do
what
I
may
have
do
;
much
less
<EOS>
what
now
,
after
so
much
consideration
and
preparation
,
I
may
be
able
to
do
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
after
serious
thinking
of
these
thing
,
I
would
be
very
melancholy
,
and
sometimes
it
would
last
a
great
while
;
but
I
resolve
it
at
last
all
into
thankfulness
to
that
Providence
which
have
deliver
me
from
so
many
unseen
danger
,
and
have
keep
me
from
those
mischief
,
which
I
could
no
way
have
be
the
agent
in
deliver
myself
from
;
because
I
have
not
the
least
notion
of
any
such
thing
depend
,
or
the
least
supposition
of
its
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
this
renew
a
contemplation
,
which
often
have
come
to
my
thought
in
former
time
,
when
first
I
begin
to
see
the
merciful
disposition
of
Heaven
,
in
the
danger
we
run
through
in
this
life
;
how
wonderfully
we
be
deliver
when
we
know
nothing
of
it
:
<EOS>
how
,
when
we
be
in
a
quandary
,
(
as
we
call
it
)
a
doubt
or
hesitation
,
whether
to
go
this
way
,
or
that
way
,
a
secret
hint
shall
direct
us
this
way
,
when
we
intend
to
go
another
way
;
nay
,
when
sense
,
our
own
inclination
,
and
perhaps
business
,
have
call
to
go
the
other
way
,
yet
a
strange
impression
upon
the
mind
,
from
we
know
not
what
spring
,
and
by
we
know
not
what
power
,
shall
over
-
rule
us
to
go
this
way
;
and
it
shall
afterwards
appear
,
that
have
we
go
that
way
which
we
would
have
go
,
and
even
to
our
imagination
<EOS>
ought
to
have
go
<EOS>
,
we
should
have
be
ruin
and
lose
;
upon
these
,
and
many
like
reflection
,
I
afterwards
make
it
a
certain
rule
with
me
,
that
whenever
I
find
those
secret
hint
,
or
pressing
of
my
mind
,
to
do
or
not
do
any
thing
that
present
,
or
to
go
this
way
or
that
way
,
I
never
fail
to
obey
the
secret
dictate
;
though
I
new
no
other
reason
for
it
,
than
that
such
a
pressure
,
or
such
an
hint
,
hang
upon
my
mind
:
I
could
give
many
example
of
the
success
of
this
conduct
in
the
course
of
my
life
;
but
more
especially
in
the
latter
part
of
my
inhabit
this
unhappy
island
;
besides
many
occasion
which
it
be
very
likely
I
may
have
take
notice
of
,
if
I
have
see
with
the
same
eye
then
that
I
see
with
now
:
but
'
tis
never
too
late
to
be
wise
;
and
I
can
not
but
advise
all
consider
man
,
whose
life
be
attend
with
such
extraordinary
incident
as
mine
,
or
even
though
not
so
extraordinary
,
not
to
slight
such
secret
intimation
of
Providence
,
let
them
come
from
what
invisible
intelligence
they
will
;
that
I
shall
not
discuss
,
and
perhaps
can
not
account
for
;
but
certainly
they
be
a
proof
of
the
converse
of
spirit
,
and
the
secret
communication
between
those
embody
,
and
those
unembodied
;
and
such
a
proof
as
can
never
be
withstand
:
of
which
I
shall
have
occasion
to
give
some
very
remarkable
instance
,
in
the
remainder
of
my
solitary
residence
in
this
dismal
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
the
reader
of
this
will
not
think
it
strange
,
if
I
confess
that
these
anxiety
,
these
constant
danger
I
live
in
,
and
the
concern
that
be
now
upon
me
,
put
an
end
to
all
invention
,
and
to
all
the
contrivance
that
I
have
lay
for
my
future
accommodation
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
care
of
my
safety
more
now
upon
my
hand
than
that
of
my
food
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
to
drive
a
nail
,
or
chop
a
stick
of
wood
now
,
for
fear
the
noise
I
should
make
should
be
hear
;
much
less
would
I
fire
a
gun
,
for
the
same
reason
;
and
,
above
all
,
I
be
very
uneasy
at
make
any
fire
,
lest
the
smoke
,
which
be
visible
at
a
great
distance
in
the
day
,
should
betray
me
;
and
for
this
reason
I
remove
that
part
of
my
business
which
require
fire
,
such
as
burn
of
pot
and
pipe
,
&
c.
into
my
new
apartment
in
the
wood
;
where
,
after
I
have
be
some
time
,
I
find
,
to
my
unspeakable
consolation
,
a
mere
natural
cave
in
the
earth
,
which
go
in
a
vast
way
,
and
where
,
I
dare
say
,
no
savage
,
<EOS>
have
he
be
at
the
mouth
of
it
,
would
be
so
hardy
as
to
venture
in
,
nor
indeed
would
any
man
else
,
but
one
who
,
like
me
,
want
nothing
so
much
as
a
safe
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
the
mouth
of
this
hollow
be
at
the
bottom
of
a
great
rock
,
where
,
by
mere
accident
,
(
I
would
say
,
if
I
do
not
see
an
abundant
reason
to
ascribe
all
such
thing
now
to
Providence
,
)
<EOS>
I
be
cut
down
some
thick
branch
of
tree
to
make
charcoal
;
and
before
I
go
on
,
I
must
observe
the
reason
of
my
making
this
charcoal
,
which
be
thus
:
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
make
a
smoke
about
my
habitation
,
as
I
say
before
;
and
yet
I
could
not
live
there
without
bake
my
bread
,
cook
my
meat
,
&
c.
;
so
I
contrive
to
burn
some
wood
here
,
as
I
have
see
do
in
England
under
turf
,
till
it
become
chark
,
or
dry
coal
;
and
then
put
the
fire
out
,
I
preserve
the
coal
to
carry
home
,
and
perform
the
other
service
,
which
fire
be
want
for
at
home
,
without
danger
or
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
by
the
by
:
while
I
be
cut
down
some
wood
here
,
I
perceive
that
behind
a
very
thick
branch
of
low
brushwood
,
or
underwood
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
kind
of
hollow
place
:
I
be
curious
to
look
into
it
,
and
get
with
difficulty
into
the
mouth
of
it
,
I
find
it
be
pretty
large
,
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
sufficient
for
me
to
stand
upright
in
it
,
and
perhaps
another
with
me
;
but
I
must
confess
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
make
more
haste
out
than
I
do
in
,
when
,
look
further
into
the
place
,
which
be
perfectly
dark
,
I
see
two
broad
shine
eye
of
some
creature
,
whether
devil
or
man
I
know
not
,
which
twinkle
like
two
star
,
the
dim
light
from
the
cave
's
mouth
shine
directly
in
and
make
the
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
after
some
pause
,
I
recover
myself
,
and
begin
to
call
myself
a
thousand
fool
,
and
tell
myself
,
that
he
that
be
afraid
to
see
the
devil
,
be
not
fit
to
live
twenty
year
in
an
island
all
alone
,
and
that
I
durst
to
believe
there
be
nothing
in
this
cave
that
be
more
frightful
than
myself
:
upon
this
,
pluck
up
my
courage
,
I
take
up
a
large
firebrand
,
and
in
I
rush
again
,
with
the
stick
flaming
in
my
hand
:
<EOS>
I
have
not
go
three
step
in
,
but
I
be
almost
as
much
frightened
as
I
be
before
;
for
I
hear
a
very
loud
sigh
,
like
that
of
a
man
in
some
pain
;
and
it
be
follow
by
a
broken
noise
,
as
if
of
word
half
-
express
,
and
then
a
deep
sigh
again
:
I
step
back
,
and
be
indeed
strike
with
such
a
surprise
,
that
it
put
me
into
a
cold
sweat
;
and
if
I
have
have
an
hat
on
my
head
,
I
will
not
answer
for
it
that
my
hair
may
not
have
lift
it
off
.
<EOS>
but
still
pluck
up
my
spirit
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
encourage
myself
a
little
,
with
consider
that
the
power
and
presence
of
God
be
every
where
,
and
be
able
to
protect
me
;
upon
this
I
step
forward
again
,
and
by
the
light
of
the
firebrand
,
hold
it
up
a
little
over
my
head
<EOS>
,
I
see
lie
on
the
ground
a
most
monstrous
frightful
old
he
-
goat
,
just
make
his
will
,
as
we
say
,
gasp
for
life
,
and
die
indeed
of
a
mere
old
age
.
  
<EOS>
I
stir
him
a
little
to
see
if
I
could
get
him
out
,
and
he
essay
to
get
up
,
but
be
not
able
to
raise
himself
;
and
I
think
with
myself
,
he
may
even
lie
there
;
for
if
he
have
frighten
me
so
,
he
would
certainly
fright
,
any
of
the
savage
,
if
any
of
them
should
be
so
hardy
as
to
come
in
there
,
while
he
have
any
life
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
recover
from
my
surprise
,
and
begin
to
look
round
me
,
when
I
find
the
cave
be
but
very
small
;
that
be
to
say
,
it
may
be
about
twelve
foot
over
,
but
in
no
manner
of
shape
,
either
round
or
square
,
no
hand
have
ever
be
employ
in
make
it
but
those
of
mere
nature
:
I
observe
also
,
that
there
be
a
place
at
the
farther
side
of
it
that
go
in
farther
,
but
so
low
,
that
it
require
me
to
creep
upon
my
hand
and
knee
to
get
into
it
,
and
whither
<EOS>
it
go
<EOS>
I
know
not
;
so
have
no
candle
,
I
give
it
over
for
some
time
,
but
resolve
to
come
again
the
next
day
,
provide
with
candle
and
a
tinder
-
box
,
which
I
have
make
of
the
lock
of
one
of
the
musket
,
with
some
wildfire
in
the
pan
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
next
day
,
I
come
provide
with
six
large
candle
of
my
own
making
,
for
I
make
very
good
candle
now
of
goat
tallow
;
and
go
into
this
low
place
,
I
be
oblige
to
creep
upon
all
four
,
as
I
have
say
,
almost
ten
yard
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
think
be
a
venture
bold
enough
,
consider
that
I
know
not
how
far
it
may
go
,
or
what
be
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
get
through
the
streight
,
I
find
the
roof
rise
higher
up
,
I
believe
near
twenty
foot
;
but
never
be
such
a
glorious
sight
see
in
the
island
,
I
dare
say
,
as
it
be
,
to
look
round
the
side
and
roof
of
this
vault
or
cave
.
<EOS>
the
wall
reflect
an
hundred
thousand
light
to
me
from
my
two
candle
;
what
it
be
in
the
rock
,
whether
diamond
,
or
any
other
precious
stone
,
or
gold
,
which
I
rather
suppose
it
to
be
,
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
the
place
I
be
in
be
a
most
delightful
cavity
,
or
grotto
,
of
its
kind
,
as
could
be
expect
,
though
perfectly
dark
;
the
floor
be
dry
and
level
,
and
have
a
sort
of
small
loose
gravel
upon
it
;
so
that
there
be
no
nauseous
creature
to
be
see
;
neither
be
there
any
damp
or
wet
on
the
side
of
the
roof
:
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
in
it
be
the
entrance
,
which
,
however
,
as
it
be
a
place
of
security
,
and
such
a
retreat
as
I
want
,
I
think
that
be
a
convenience
;
so
that
I
be
really
rejoice
at
the
discovery
,
and
resolve
,
without
any
delay
,
to
bring
some
of
those
thing
which
I
be
most
anxious
about
to
this
place
;
<EOS>
particularly
,
I
resolve
to
bring
hither
my
magazine
of
powder
,
and
all
my
spare
arm
,
viz
.
<EOS>
two
fowl
-
piece
(
for
I
have
three
in
all
)
and
three
musket
;
(
for
of
them
I
have
eight
in
all
)
<EOS>
so
I
keep
at
my
castle
only
five
,
which
stand
ready
mount
,
like
piece
of
cannon
,
on
my
utmost
fence
,
and
be
ready
also
to
take
out
upon
any
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
of
remove
my
ammunition
,
I
be
oblige
to
open
the
barrel
of
powder
which
I
take
up
out
of
the
sea
,
and
which
have
be
wet
;
and
I
find
,
that
the
water
have
penetrate
about
three
or
four
inch
into
the
powder
on
every
side
,
which
,
cake
and
grow
hard
,
have
preserve
the
inside
like
a
kernel
in
a
shell
;
so
that
I
have
near
sixty
pound
of
very
good
powder
in
the
centre
of
the
cask
;
and
this
be
an
agreeable
discovery
to
me
at
that
time
;
<EOS>
so
I
carry
all
away
thither
,
never
keep
above
two
or
three
pound
of
powder
with
me
in
my
castle
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
of
any
kind
;
I
also
carry
thither
all
the
lead
I
have
leave
for
bullet
.
  
<EOS>
I
fancy
myself
now
like
one
of
the
ancient
giant
,
which
be
say
to
live
in
cave
and
hole
in
the
rock
,
where
none
could
come
at
them
;
for
I
persuade
myself
while
I
be
here
,
if
five
hundred
savage
be
to
hunt
me
,
they
could
never
find
me
out
;
or
if
they
do
,
they
would
not
venture
to
attack
me
here
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
goat
,
which
I
find
expire
,
die
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
next
day
after
I
make
this
discovery
;
and
I
find
it
much
easy
to
dig
a
great
hole
there
,
and
throw
him
in
,
and
cover
him
with
earth
,
than
to
drag
him
out
:
<EOS>
so
I
inter
him
there
,
to
prevent
offence
to
my
nose
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
my
twenty
-
third
year
of
residence
in
this
island
,
and
be
so
naturalize
to
the
place
,
and
to
the
manner
of
living
,
that
could
I
have
but
enjoy
the
certainty
that
no
savage
would
come
to
the
place
to
disturb
me
,
I
could
have
be
content
to
have
capitulate
for
spend
the
rest
of
my
time
there
,
even
to
the
last
moment
,
till
I
have
lay
me
down
and
die
,
like
the
old
goat
,
in
the
cave
:
<EOS>
I
have
also
arrive
to
some
little
diversion
and
amusement
,
which
make
the
time
pass
more
pleasantly
with
me
a
great
deal
than
it
do
before
;
as
,
first
,
I
have
teach
my
Pol
,
as
I
note
before
,
to
speak
;
and
he
do
it
so
familiarly
,
and
talk
so
articulately
and
plain
,
that
it
be
very
pleasant
to
me
;
and
he
live
with
me
no
less
than
six
-
and
-
twenty
year
:
how
long
he
may
live
afterwards
I
know
not
;
<EOS>
though
I
know
they
have
a
notion
in
the
Brasils
,
that
they
live
an
hundred
year
;
perhaps
some
of
my
poll
may
be
alive
there
still
,
call
after
poor
Robin
Crusoe
to
this
day
;
I
wish
no
Englishman
the
ill
luck
to
come
there
and
hear
them
;
but
if
he
do
,
he
would
certainly
believe
it
be
the
devil
.
<EOS>
My
dog
be
a
very
pleasant
and
love
companion
to
me
for
no
less
than
sixteen
year
of
my
time
,
and
then
die
of
mere
old
age
;
as
for
my
cat
,
they
multiply
,
as
I
have
observe
,
to
that
degree
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
shoot
several
of
them
at
first
,
to
keep
them
from
devour
me
,
and
all
I
have
;
but
at
length
,
when
the
two
old
one
I
bring
with
me
be
go
,
and
after
some
time
continually
drive
them
from
me
,
and
let
them
have
no
provision
with
me
,
they
all
run
wild
into
the
wood
,
except
two
or
three
favourite
,
which
I
keep
tame
,
and
whose
young
,
when
they
have
any
,
I
always
drown
,
and
these
be
part
of
my
family
:
besides
these
,
I
always
keep
two
or
three
household
kid
about
me
,
which
I
teach
to
feed
out
of
my
hand
;
and
I
have
also
more
parrot
which
talk
pretty
well
,
and
would
all
call
Robin
Crusoe
,
but
none
like
my
first
;
nor
,
indeed
,
do
I
take
the
pain
with
any
of
them
that
I
have
do
with
him
:
<EOS>
I
have
also
several
tame
sea
-
fowl
,
whose
name
I
know
not
,
which
I
catch
upon
the
shore
,
and
cut
their
wing
;
and
the
little
stake
,
which
I
have
plant
before
my
castle
wall
,
be
now
grow
up
to
a
good
thick
grove
,
these
fowl
all
live
among
these
low
tree
,
and
breed
there
,
which
be
very
agreeable
to
me
;
so
that
,
as
I
say
above
,
I
begin
to
be
very
well
contented
with
the
life
I
lead
,
if
it
may
but
have
be
secure
from
the
dread
of
savage
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
otherwise
direct
;
and
it
may
not
be
amiss
for
all
people
who
shall
meet
with
my
story
to
make
this
just
observation
from
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
how
frequently
,
in
the
course
of
our
life
,
the
evil
,
which
in
itself
we
seek
most
to
shun
,
and
which
,
when
we
be
fall
into
,
be
the
most
dreadful
to
us
,
be
oftentime
the
very
means
or
door
of
our
deliverance
,
by
which
alone
we
can
be
raise
again
from
the
affliction
we
be
fall
into
.
<EOS>
I
could
give
many
example
of
this
in
the
course
of
my
unaccountable
life
;
but
in
nothing
be
it
more
particularly
remarkable
,
than
in
the
circumstance
of
my
last
year
of
solitary
residence
in
this
island
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
mouth
of
December
,
as
I
say
above
,
in
my
twenty
-
third
year
;
and
this
be
the
southern
solstice
,
for
winter
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
it
,
be
the
particular
time
of
my
harvest
,
and
require
my
be
pretty
much
abroad
in
the
field
;
when
go
out
pretty
early
in
the
morning
,
even
before
it
be
thorough
daylight
,
I
be
surprised
with
see
a
light
of
some
fire
upon
the
shore
,
at
a
distance
from
me
of
about
two
mile
,
towards
the
end
of
the
island
,
where
I
have
observe
some
savage
have
be
,
as
before
;
but
not
on
the
other
side
;
but
,
to
my
great
affliction
,
it
be
on
my
side
of
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
terribly
surprised
at
the
sight
,
and
stop
short
within
my
grove
,
not
daring
to
go
out
,
lest
I
may
be
surprised
;
and
yet
I
have
no
more
peace
within
,
from
the
apprehension
I
have
,
that
if
these
savage
,
in
ramble
over
the
island
,
should
find
my
corn
standing
,
or
cut
,
or
any
of
my
work
and
improvement
,
they
would
immediately
conclude
that
there
be
people
in
the
place
,
and
would
then
never
give
over
till
they
find
me
out
.
<EOS>
in
this
extremity
I
go
back
directly
to
my
castle
,
pull
up
the
ladder
after
me
,
have
make
all
thing
without
look
as
wild
and
natural
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
prepare
myself
within
,
put
myself
in
a
posture
of
defence
;
I
load
all
my
cannon
,
as
I
call
them
,
that
be
to
say
,
my
musket
,
which
be
mount
upon
my
new
fortification
,
and
all
my
pistol
,
and
resolve
to
defend
myself
to
the
last
gasp
;
not
forget
seriously
to
recommend
myself
to
the
divine
protection
,
and
earnestly
to
pray
to
God
to
deliver
me
out
of
the
hand
of
the
barbarian
;
and
in
this
posture
I
continue
about
two
hour
,
but
begin
to
be
mighty
impatient
for
intelligence
abroad
,
for
I
have
no
spy
to
send
out
.
  
<EOS>
after
sit
awhile
longer
,
and
muse
what
I
should
do
in
this
case
,
I
be
not
able
to
bear
sit
in
ignorance
longer
;
so
set
up
my
ladder
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
where
there
be
a
flat
place
,
as
I
observe
before
,
and
then
pull
the
ladder
up
after
me
<EOS>
,
I
set
it
up
again
,
and
mount
to
the
top
of
the
hill
;
and
pull
out
my
perspective
glass
,
which
I
have
take
on
purpose
,
I
lay
me
down
flat
on
my
belly
on
the
ground
,
and
begin
to
look
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
presently
find
there
be
no
less
than
nine
naked
savage
sit
round
a
small
fire
they
have
make
;
not
to
warm
them
,
for
they
have
no
need
of
that
,
the
weather
be
extreme
hot
;
but
,
as
I
suppose
,
to
dress
some
of
their
barbarous
diet
of
human
flesh
which
they
have
bring
with
them
,
whether
alive
or
dead
I
could
not
know
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
two
canoe
with
them
,
which
they
have
hale
up
upon
the
shore
;
and
as
it
be
then
tide
of
ebb
,
they
seem
to
me
to
wait
the
return
of
the
flood
to
go
away
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
imagine
what
confusion
this
sight
put
me
into
,
especially
see
them
come
on
my
side
the
island
,
and
so
near
me
too
;
but
when
I
observe
their
coming
must
be
always
with
the
current
of
the
ebb
,
I
begin
afterwards
to
be
more
sedate
in
my
mind
,
be
satisfied
that
I
may
go
abroad
with
safety
all
the
time
of
tide
of
flood
,
if
they
be
not
on
shore
before
;
and
have
make
this
observation
,
I
go
abroad
about
my
harvest
work
with
the
more
composure
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
expect
,
so
it
prove
;
for
as
soon
as
the
tide
make
to
the
westward
,
I
see
them
all
take
boat
,
and
row
(
or
paddle
,
as
we
call
it
)
<EOS>
all
away
:
I
should
have
observe
,
that
for
an
hour
and
more
before
they
go
off
,
they
go
to
dancing
,
and
I
could
easily
discern
their
posture
and
gesture
by
my
glass
;
I
could
only
perceive
,
by
my
nice
observation
,
that
they
be
stark
naked
,
and
have
not
the
least
cover
upon
them
;
but
whether
they
be
man
or
woman
,
that
I
could
not
distinguish
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
see
them
ship
and
go
,
I
take
two
gun
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
two
pistol
at
my
girdle
,
and
my
great
sword
by
my
side
,
without
a
scabbard
;
and
with
all
the
speed
I
be
able
to
make
,
I
go
away
to
the
hill
,
where
I
have
discover
the
first
appearance
of
all
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
get
thither
,
which
be
not
less
than
two
hour
,
(
for
I
could
not
go
apace
,
be
so
load
with
arm
as
I
be
,
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
there
have
be
three
canoe
more
of
savage
on
that
place
;
and
look
out
further
,
I
see
they
be
all
at
sea
together
,
make
over
for
the
main
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
dreadful
sight
to
me
,
especially
when
,
go
down
to
the
shore
,
I
could
see
the
mark
of
horror
which
the
dismal
work
they
have
be
about
have
leave
behind
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
blood
,
the
bone
,
and
part
of
the
flesh
of
human
body
,
eat
and
devour
by
those
wretch
with
merriment
and
sport
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
fill
with
indignation
at
the
sight
,
that
I
begin
now
to
premeditate
the
destruction
of
the
next
that
I
see
there
,
let
them
be
who
or
how
many
soever
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
evident
to
me
,
that
the
visit
which
they
thus
make
to
this
island
be
not
very
frequent
;
for
it
be
above
fifteen
month
before
any
more
of
them
come
on
shore
there
again
;
that
be
to
say
,
I
never
see
them
,
or
any
footstep
or
signal
of
them
,
in
all
that
time
;
for
as
to
the
rainy
season
,
then
they
be
sure
not
to
come
abroad
,
at
least
not
so
far
;
yet
all
this
while
I
live
uncomfortably
,
by
reason
of
the
constant
apprehension
I
be
in
of
their
come
upon
me
by
surprise
;
from
whence
I
observe
,
that
the
expectation
of
evil
be
more
bitter
than
the
suffering
,
especially
if
there
be
no
room
to
shake
off
that
expectation
or
those
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
,
I
be
in
the
murder
humour
;
and
take
up
most
of
my
hour
,
which
should
have
be
better
employ
,
in
contrive
how
to
circumvent
and
fall
upon
them
the
very
next
time
I
should
see
them
;
especially
if
they
should
he
divide
,
as
they
be
the
last
time
,
into
two
party
;
nor
do
I
consider
at
all
,
that
if
I
kill
one
party
,
suppose
ten
or
a
dozen
,
I
be
still
the
next
day
,
or
week
,
or
mouth
,
to
kill
another
,
and
so
another
,
even
ad
infinitum
,
till
I
should
be
at
length
no
less
a
murderer
than
they
be
in
be
man
-
eater
,
and
perhaps
much
mere
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
spend
my
day
now
in
great
perplexity
and
anxiety
of
mind
,
expect
that
I
should
one
day
or
other
fall
into
the
hand
of
those
merciless
creature
;
if
I
do
at
any
time
venture
abroad
,
it
be
not
without
look
round
me
with
the
great
care
and
caution
imaginable
;
and
now
I
find
,
to
my
great
comfort
,
how
happy
it
be
that
I
have
provide
a
tame
flock
or
herd
of
goat
;
for
I
durst
not
,
upon
any
account
,
fire
my
gun
especially
near
that
side
of
the
island
,
where
they
usually
come
,
lest
I
should
alarm
the
savage
;
and
if
they
have
flee
from
me
now
,
I
be
sure
to
have
them
come
back
again
,
with
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
canoe
with
them
in
a
few
day
,
and
then
I
know
what
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
wear
out
a
year
and
three
month
more
before
I
ever
see
any
more
of
the
savage
,
and
then
I
find
them
again
,
as
I
shall
soon
observe
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
they
may
have
be
there
once
or
twice
,
but
either
they
make
no
stay
,
or
,
at
least
,
I
do
not
hear
them
;
but
in
the
month
of
May
,
as
near
as
I
could
calculate
,
and
in
my
four
-
and
-
twentieth
year
,
I
have
a
very
strange
encounter
with
them
,
of
which
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
perturbation
of
my
mind
,
during
this
fifteen
or
sixteen
month
interval
,
be
very
great
;
I
sleep
unquiet
,
dream
always
frightful
dream
,
and
often
start
out
of
my
sleep
in
the
night
;
in
the
day
great
trouble
overwhelm
my
mind
;
in
the
night
I
dream
often
of
kill
the
savage
,
and
the
reason
why
I
may
justify
the
doing
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
to
wave
all
this
for
awhile
,
it
be
in
the
middle
of
May
,
on
the
sixteenth
day
,
I
think
,
as
well
as
my
poor
wooden
calendar
would
reckon
,
<EOS>
for
I
mark
all
upon
,
the
post
still
;
I
say
,
it
be
on
the
sixteenth
of
May
that
it
blow
a
great
storm
of
wind
all
day
,
with
a
great
deal
of
lightning
and
thunder
,
and
a
very
foul
night
be
after
it
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
be
the
particular
occasion
of
it
;
but
as
I
be
read
in
the
Bible
,
and
take
up
with
serious
thought
about
my
present
condition
,
I
be
surprised
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
,
as
I
think
,
fire
at
sea
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
to
be
sure
,
a
surprise
of
a
quite
different
nature
from
any
I
have
meet
with
before
;
for
the
notion
this
put
into
my
thought
be
quite
of
another
kind
:
I
start
up
in
the
great
haste
imaginable
;
and
in
a
trice
clap
up
my
ladder
to
the
middle
place
of
the
rock
,
and
pull
it
after
me
,
and
mount
it
the
second
time
,
get
to
the
top
of
the
hill
;
that
very
moment
a
flash
of
fire
bade
me
listen
for
a
second
gun
,
which
accordingly
in
about
half
a
moment
I
hear
,
and
by
the
sound
know
that
it
be
from
that
part
of
the
sea
where
I
be
drive
out
with
the
current
in
my
boat
.
  
<EOS>
I
immediately
consider
that
this
must
be
some
ship
in
distress
,
and
that
they
have
some
comrade
,
or
some
other
ship
in
company
,
and
fire
these
gun
for
signal
of
distress
,
and
to
obtain
help
.
<EOS>
I
have
this
presence
of
mind
at
that
minute
as
to
think
,
that
though
I
could
not
help
them
,
it
may
be
they
may
help
me
;
so
I
bring
together
all
the
dry
wood
I
could
get
at
hand
,
and
make
a
good
handsome
pile
<EOS>
,
I
set
it
on
fire
upon
the
hill
;
the
wood
be
dry
,
and
blaze
freely
,
and
though
the
wind
blow
very
hard
,
yet
it
burn
fairly
out
,
so
that
I
be
certain
,
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
such
thing
as
a
ship
,
they
must
need
see
it
,
and
no
doubt
they
do
;
for
as
soon
as
ever
my
fire
blaze
up
,
I
hear
another
gun
,
and
after
that
several
other
,
all
from
the
same
quarter
.
<EOS>
I
ply
my
fire
all
night
long
,
till
day
break
;
and
when
it
be
broad
day
,
and
the
air
clear
up
,
I
see
something
at
a
great
distance
at
sea
,
full
east
of
the
island
,
whether
a
sail
,
or
an
hull
,
I
could
not
distinguish
,
no
not
with
my
glass
,
the
distance
be
so
great
,
and
the
weather
still
something
hazy
also
;
at
least
it
be
so
out
at
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
frequently
at
it
all
that
day
,
and
soon
perceive
that
it
do
not
move
;
so
I
presently
conclude
that
it
be
a
ship
at
anchor
;
and
be
eager
,
you
may
be
sure
,
to
be
satisfied
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
gun
in
my
hand
,
and
run
towards
the
south
-
east
side
of
the
island
,
to
the
rock
,
where
I
have
be
formerly
carry
away
with
the
current
;
and
get
up
there
,
the
weather
by
this
time
be
perfectly
clear
,
I
could
plainly
see
,
to
my
great
sorrow
,
the
wreck
of
a
ship
cast
away
in
the
night
upon
those
conceal
rock
which
I
find
when
I
be
out
in
my
boat
;
and
which
rock
,
as
they
check
the
violence
of
the
stream
,
and
make
a
kind
of
counter
-
stream
,
or
eddy
,
be
the
occasion
of
my
recovering
then
from
the
most
desperate
hopeless
condition
that
ever
I
have
be
in
all
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
what
be
one
man
's
safety
be
another
man
's
destruction
;
for
it
seem
these
man
,
whoever
they
be
,
be
out
of
their
knowledge
,
and
the
rock
be
wholly
under
water
,
have
be
drive
upon
them
in
the
night
,
the
wind
blow
hard
at
E.
and
E.N.E.
<EOS>
have
they
see
the
island
,
as
I
must
necessarily
suppose
they
do
not
,
they
must
,
as
I
think
,
have
endeavour
to
have
save
themselves
on
shore
by
the
help
of
their
boat
;
but
the
firing
of
their
gun
for
help
,
especially
when
they
see
,
as
I
imagine
,
my
fire
,
fill
me
with
many
thought
:
first
,
I
imagine
,
that
,
upon
see
my
light
,
they
may
have
put
themselves
into
their
boat
,
and
have
endeavour
to
make
the
shore
;
but
that
the
sea
go
very
high
,
they
may
have
be
cast
away
;
other
time
I
imagine
,
that
they
may
have
lose
their
boat
before
,
as
may
be
the
case
many
way
;
as
particularly
,
by
the
breaking
of
the
sea
upon
their
ship
,
which
many
time
oblige
man
to
stave
,
or
take
in
piece
their
boat
;
and
sometimes
to
throw
it
overboard
with
their
own
hand
;
other
time
I
imagine
,
they
have
some
other
ship
or
ship
in
company
,
who
,
upon
the
signal
of
distress
they
have
make
,
have
take
them
up
,
and
carry
them
off
:
<EOS>
other
while
I
fancy
they
be
all
go
off
to
sea
in
their
boat
,
and
be
hurry
away
by
the
current
that
I
have
be
formerly
in
,
be
carry
out
into
the
great
ocean
,
where
there
be
nothing
but
misery
and
perishing
;
and
that
perhaps
they
may
by
this
time
think
of
starve
,
and
of
be
in
a
condition
to
eat
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
be
but
conjecture
at
best
,
so
,
in
the
condition
<EOS>
I
be
in
<EOS>
,
I
could
do
no
more
than
look
upon
the
misery
of
the
poor
man
,
and
pity
them
;
which
have
still
this
good
effect
on
my
side
,
that
it
give
me
more
and
more
cause
to
give
thank
to
God
,
who
have
so
happily
and
comfortably
provide
for
me
in
my
desolate
condition
;
and
that
of
two
ship
'
company
,
who
be
now
cast
away
upon
this
part
of
the
world
,
not
one
life
should
be
spare
but
mine
.
<EOS>
I
learn
here
again
to
observe
,
that
it
be
very
rare
that
the
providence
of
God
cast
us
into
any
condition
of
life
so
low
,
or
any
misery
so
great
,
but
we
may
see
something
or
other
to
be
thankful
for
,
and
may
see
other
in
bad
circumstance
than
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
such
certainly
be
the
case
of
these
man
,
of
whom
I
could
not
so
much
as
see
room
to
suppose
any
of
them
be
save
;
nothing
could
make
it
rational
,
so
much
as
to
wish
or
expect
that
they
do
not
all
perish
there
,
except
the
possibility
only
of
their
be
take
up
by
another
ship
in
company
:
and
this
be
but
<EOS>
mere
possibility
indeed
;
for
I
see
not
the
least
signal
or
appearance
of
any
such
thing
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
explain
,
by
any
possible
energy
of
word
,
what
a
strange
longing
,
or
hankering
of
desire
,
I
feel
in
my
soul
upon
this
sight
;
break
out
sometimes
thus
:
"
o
that
there
have
be
but
one
or
two
,
nay
,
but
one
soul
save
out
of
the
ship
,
to
have
escape
to
me
,
that
I
may
but
have
have
one
companion
,
one
fellow
-
creature
to
have
speak
to
me
,
and
to
have
converse
with
!
"
<EOS>
in
all
the
time
of
my
solitary
life
,
I
never
feel
so
earnest
,
so
strong
a
desire
after
the
society
of
my
fellow
-
creature
,
or
so
deep
a
regret
at
want
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
secret
move
spring
in
the
affection
,
which
,
when
they
be
set
a
going
by
some
object
in
view
,
or
be
it
some
object
though
not
in
view
,
yet
render
present
to
the
mind
by
the
power
of
imagination
,
that
motion
carry
out
the
soul
by
its
impetuosity
to
such
violent
eager
embracing
of
the
object
,
that
the
absence
of
it
be
insupportable
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
these
earnest
wishing
,
"
that
but
one
man
have
be
save
!
<EOS>
o
that
it
have
be
but
one
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
believe
I
repeat
the
word
,
"
<EOS>
o
that
it
have
be
but
one
!
"
<EOS>
a
thousand
time
;
and
my
desire
be
so
move
by
it
,
that
when
I
speak
the
word
,
my
hand
would
clinch
together
,
and
my
finger
press
the
palm
of
my
hand
,
that
if
I
have
have
any
soft
thing
in
my
hand
,
it
would
have
crush
it
involuntarily
;
and
my
tooth
in
my
head
would
strike
together
,
and
set
against
one
another
so
strong
,
that
for
some
time
I
could
not
part
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
let
the
naturalist
explain
these
thing
,
and
the
reason
and
manner
of
them
:
all
I
can
say
of
them
be
,
to
describe
the
fact
,
which
be
ever
surprising
to
me
when
I
find
it
,
though
I
know
not
from
what
it
should
proceed
;
it
be
doubtless
the
effect
of
ardent
wish
,
and
of
strong
idea
form
in
my
mind
,
realize
the
comfort
which
the
conversation
of
one
of
my
fellow
-
christians
would
have
be
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
be
;
either
their
fate
,
or
mine
,
or
both
,
forbad
it
;
for
till
the
last
year
of
my
being
on
this
island
,
I
never
know
whether
any
be
save
out
of
that
ship
,
or
no
;
and
have
only
the
affliction
some
day
after
to
see
the
corpse
of
a
drown
boy
come
on
shore
,
at
the
end
of
the
island
which
be
next
the
shipwreck
:
he
have
on
no
clothe
but
a
seaman
's
waistcoat
,
a
pair
of
open
kneed
linen
drawer
,
and
a
blue
linen
shirt
;
but
nothing
to
direct
me
so
much
as
to
guess
what
nation
he
be
of
:
he
have
nothing
in
his
pocket
but
two
piece
of
eight
,
and
a
tobacco
-
pipe
;
the
last
be
to
me
of
ten
time
more
value
than
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
calm
,
and
I
have
a
great
mind
to
venture
out
in
my
boat
to
this
wreck
,
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
may
find
something
on
board
that
may
be
useful
to
me
;
but
that
do
not
altogether
press
me
so
much
,
as
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
yet
some
live
creature
on
board
,
whose
life
I
may
not
only
save
,
but
may
,
by
save
that
life
,
comfort
my
own
to
the
last
degree
:
and
this
thought
clung
<EOS>
so
to
my
heart
,
that
I
could
not
be
quiet
night
nor
day
,
but
I
must
venture
out
in
my
boat
on
board
this
wreck
;
and
commit
the
rest
to
God
's
providence
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
impression
be
so
strong
upon
my
mind
,
that
it
could
not
be
resist
,
that
it
must
come
from
some
invisible
direction
,
and
that
I
should
be
want
to
myself
if
I
do
not
go
.
  
<EOS>
under
the
power
of
this
impression
,
I
hasten
back
to
my
castle
,
prepare
every
thing
for
my
voyage
,
take
a
quantity
of
bread
,
a
great
pot
for
fresh
water
,
a
compass
to
steer
by
,
a
bottle
of
rum
,
(
for
I
have
still
a
great
deal
of
that
leave
)
<EOS>
a
basket
full
of
raisin
:
and
thus
load
myself
with
every
thing
necessary
<EOS>
,
I
go
down
to
my
boat
,
get
the
water
out
of
her
,
and
get
her
afloat
,
load
all
my
cargo
in
her
,
and
then
go
home
again
for
more
:
<EOS>
my
second
cargo
be
a
great
bag
full
of
rice
,
the
umbrella
to
set
up
over
my
head
for
shade
,
another
large
pot
full
of
lush
water
,
and
about
two
dozen
of
my
small
loaf
,
or
barley
-
cake
,
more
than
before
,
with
a
bottle
of
goat
's
milk
,
and
a
cheese
:
all
which
,
with
great
labour
and
sweat
,
I
bring
to
my
boat
;
and
pray
to
God
to
direct
my
voyage
,
I
put
out
,
and
row
or
paddle
the
canoe
along
the
shore
,
I
come
at
last
to
the
utmost
point
of
the
island
,
on
that
side
,
viz
.
<EOS>
N.E.
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
to
launch
out
into
the
ocean
,
and
either
to
venture
,
or
not
to
venture
;
I
look
on
the
rapid
current
which
run
constantly
on
both
side
of
the
island
,
at
a
distance
,
and
which
be
very
terrible
to
me
,
from
the
remembrance
of
the
hazard
I
have
be
in
before
,
and
my
heart
begin
to
fail
me
;
for
I
foresaw
,
that
if
I
be
drive
into
either
of
those
current
,
I
should
be
carry
a
vast
way
out
to
sea
and
perhaps
out
of
my
reach
,
or
sight
of
the
island
again
;
and
that
then
,
as
my
boat
be
but
small
,
if
any
little
gale
of
wind
should
rise
,
I
should
be
inevitably
lose
.
  
<EOS>
these
thought
so
oppress
my
mind
,
that
I
begin
to
give
over
my
enterprise
,
and
have
hale
my
boat
into
a
little
creek
on
the
shore
,
I
step
out
,
and
sit
me
down
upon
a
little
spot
of
rise
ground
,
very
pensive
and
anxious
,
between
fear
and
desire
,
about
my
voyage
;
when
,
as
I
be
muse
,
I
could
perceive
that
the
tide
be
turn
,
and
the
flood
come
on
,
upon
which
my
going
be
for
so
many
hour
impracticable
:
upon
this
it
presently
occur
to
me
,
that
I
should
go
up
to
the
high
piece
of
ground
I
could
find
,
and
observe
,
if
I
could
,
how
the
set
of
the
tide
or
current
lie
,
when
the
flood
come
in
,
that
I
may
judge
whether
,
if
I
be
drive
one
way
out
,
I
may
not
expect
to
be
drive
another
way
home
,
with
the
same
rapidness
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
this
thought
be
no
sooner
in
my
head
,
but
I
cast
my
eye
upon
a
little
hill
which
sufficiently
overlook
the
sea
both
way
,
and
from
whence
I
have
a
clear
view
of
the
current
,
or
set
of
the
tide
,
and
which
way
I
be
to
guide
myself
in
my
return
:
here
I
find
,
that
as
the
current
of
the
ebb
set
out
close
by
the
south
point
of
the
island
,
so
the
current
of
the
flood
set
in
close
by
the
shore
of
the
north
side
;
and
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
to
the
north
of
the
island
in
my
return
,
and
I
should
do
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
encourage
with
this
observation
,
I
resolve
the
next
morning
to
set
out
with
the
first
of
the
tide
;
and
repose
myself
for
that
night
in
the
canoe
,
under
the
great
watch
-
coat
<EOS>
I
mention
,
I
launch
out
.
<EOS>
I
make
first
a
little
out
to
sea
full
north
,
till
I
begin
to
feel
the
benefit
of
the
current
,
which
sit
eastward
,
and
which
carry
me
at
a
great
rate
,
and
yet
do
not
so
hurry
me
as
the
southern
side
current
have
do
before
,
and
so
as
to
take
from
me
all
government
of
the
boat
;
but
have
a
strong
steerage
with
my
paddle
<EOS>
,
I
go
,
I
say
,
at
a
great
rate
,
directly
for
the
wreck
,
and
in
less
than
two
hour
I
come
up
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
dismal
sight
to
take
at
:
the
ship
,
which
by
its
building
be
spanish
,
stuck
fast
,
jambe
in
between
two
rock
;
all
the
stern
and
quarter
of
her
be
beat
to
piece
with
the
sea
;
and
as
her
forecastle
,
which
stick
in
the
rock
,
have
run
on
with
great
violence
,
her
main
-
mast
and
fore
-
mast
be
bring
by
the
board
,
that
be
to
say
,
break
short
off
,
but
her
boltsprit
be
sound
,
and
the
head
and
bow
appear
firm
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
close
to
her
,
a
dog
appear
upon
her
,
which
,
see
me
come
,
yelp
and
cry
,
and
as
soon
as
I
call
him
,
jump
into
the
sea
to
come
to
me
:
and
I
take
him
into
the
boat
,
but
find
him
almost
dead
for
hunger
and
thirst
<EOS>
:
I
give
him
a
cake
of
my
bread
,
and
he
eat
like
a
ravenous
wolf
that
have
be
starve
a
fortnight
in
the
snow
:
<EOS>
I
then
give
the
poor
creature
some
fresh
water
,
with
which
,
if
I
would
have
let
him
,
he
would
have
burst
himself
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
I
go
on
board
.
<EOS>
the
first
sight
I
meet
with
be
two
man
drown
in
the
cook
-
room
,
or
forecastle
of
the
ship
,
with
their
arm
fast
about
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
conclude
,
as
be
indeed
probable
,
that
when
the
ship
strike
,
it
be
in
a
storm
,
the
sea
break
so
high
,
and
so
continually
over
her
,
that
the
man
be
not
able
to
bear
it
,
and
be
strangle
with
the
constant
rushing
in
of
the
water
,
as
much
as
if
they
have
be
under
water
.
<EOS>
besides
the
dog
,
there
be
nothing
leave
in
the
ship
that
have
life
,
nor
any
good
that
I
could
see
,
but
what
be
spoil
by
the
water
:
there
be
some
cask
of
liquor
,
whether
wine
or
brandy
I
know
not
,
which
lie
low
in
the
hold
,
and
which
,
the
water
be
ebb
out
,
I
could
see
;
but
they
be
too
big
to
meddle
with
:
<EOS>
I
see
several
chest
,
which
I
believe
belong
to
some
of
the
seaman
,
and
I
get
two
of
them
into
the
boat
without
examine
what
be
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
stern
of
the
ship
be
fix
,
and
the
fore
part
break
off
,
I
be
persuade
I
may
have
make
a
good
voyage
;
for
by
what
I
find
in
these
two
chest
,
I
have
room
to
suppose
the
ship
have
a
great
deal
of
wealth
on
board
;
and
if
I
may
guess
by
the
course
she
steer
,
she
must
have
be
bind
from
the
Buenos
Ayres
,
or
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
,
in
the
south
part
of
America
,
beyond
the
Brasils
,
to
the
Havanna
,
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
and
so
perhaps
to
Spain
:
<EOS>
she
have
,
no
doubt
,
a
great
treasure
in
her
,
but
of
no
use
at
that
time
to
any
body
;
and
what
become
of
the
rest
of
her
people
I
then
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
,
besides
these
chest
,
a
little
cask
full
of
liquor
,
of
about
twenty
gallon
,
which
I
get
into
my
boat
with
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
musket
in
a
cabin
,
and
a
great
powder
-
horn
,
with
about
four
pound
of
powder
in
it
:
as
for
the
musket
,
I
have
no
occasion
for
them
,
so
I
leave
them
,
but
take
the
powder
-
horn
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
fire
-
shovel
and
tong
,
which
I
want
extremely
;
as
also
two
little
brass
kettle
,
a
copper
pot
to
make
chocolate
,
and
a
gridiron
;
and
with
this
cargo
,
and
the
dog
<EOS>
,
I
come
away
,
the
tide
begin
to
make
home
again
;
and
the
same
evening
,
about
an
hour
within
night
,
I
reach
the
island
again
,
weary
and
fatigue
to
the
last
degree
.
  
<EOS>
I
repose
that
night
in
the
boat
,
and
in
the
morning
I
resolve
to
harbour
what
I
have
get
in
my
new
cave
,
not
to
carry
it
home
to
my
castle
.
<EOS>
after
refresh
myself
,
I
get
all
my
cargo
on
shore
,
and
begin
to
examine
the
particular
:
the
cask
of
liquor
I
find
to
be
a
kind
of
rum
,
but
not
such
as
we
have
at
the
Brasils
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
not
at
all
good
;
but
when
I
come
to
open
the
chest
,
I
find
several
thing
which
I
want
:
for
example
,
I
find
in
one
a
fine
case
of
bottle
,
of
an
extraordinary
kind
,
and
fill
with
cordial
water
,
fine
,
and
very
good
<EOS>
;
the
bottle
hold
about
three
pint
each
,
and
be
tip
with
silver
:
I
find
two
pot
of
very
good
succade
,
or
sweetmeat
,
so
fasten
also
on
the
top
,
that
the
salt
water
have
not
hurt
them
;
and
two
more
of
the
same
,
which
the
water
have
spoil
:
I
find
some
very
good
shirt
,
which
be
very
welcome
to
me
,
and
about
a
dozen
and
a
half
of
white
linen
handkerchief
and
coloured
neckcloth
;
the
former
be
also
very
welcome
,
be
exceed
refresh
to
wipe
my
face
in
a
hot
day
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
when
I
come
to
the
till
in
the
chest
,
I
find
there
three
great
bag
of
piece
of
eight
,
which
hold
about
eleven
hundred
piece
in
all
;
and
in
one
of
them
,
wrapt
up
in
a
paper
,
six
doubloon
of
gold
,
and
some
small
bar
or
wedge
of
gold
;
I
suppose
they
may
all
weigh
near
a
pound
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
chest
I
find
have
some
clothe
in
it
,
but
of
little
value
;
but
by
the
circumstance
,
it
must
have
belong
to
the
gunner
's
mate
,
as
there
be
no
powder
in
it
,
but
about
two
pound
of
glaze
powder
in
the
three
flask
,
keep
,
I
suppose
,
for
charge
their
fowling
-
piece
on
occasion
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
get
very
little
by
this
voyage
that
be
of
much
use
to
me
;
for
,
as
to
the
money
,
I
have
no
manner
of
occasion
for
it
;
it
be
to
me
as
the
dirt
under
my
foot
;
and
I
would
have
give
it
all
for
three
or
four
pair
of
english
shoe
and
stocking
,
which
be
thing
I
greatly
want
,
but
have
not
have
on
my
foot
now
for
many
year
:
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
get
two
pair
of
shoe
now
,
which
I
take
off
the
foot
of
the
two
drown
man
whom
I
see
in
the
wreck
;
and
I
find
two
pair
more
in
one
of
the
chest
,
which
be
very
welcome
to
me
;
but
they
be
not
like
our
english
shoe
,
either
for
case
or
service
,
be
rather
what
we
call
pump
than
shoe
.
<EOS>
I
find
in
the
seaman
's
chest
about
fifty
piece
of
eight
in
royal
,
but
no
gold
:
<EOS>
I
suppose
this
belong
to
a
poor
man
than
the
other
,
which
seem
to
belong
to
some
officer
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
however
,
I
lug
the
money
home
to
my
cave
,
and
lay
it
up
,
as
I
have
do
that
before
,
which
I
bring
from
our
own
ship
;
but
it
be
great
pity
,
as
I
say
,
that
the
other
part
of
the
ship
have
not
come
to
my
share
,
for
I
be
satisfied
I
may
have
load
my
canoe
several
time
over
with
money
,
which
,
if
I
have
ever
escape
to
England
,
would
have
lain
here
safe
enough
till
I
may
have
come
again
and
fetch
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
bring
all
my
thing
on
shore
,
and
secure
them
,
I
go
back
to
my
boat
,
and
row
or
paddle
her
along
the
shore
to
her
old
harbour
,
where
I
lay
her
up
,
and
make
the
good
of
my
way
to
my
old
habitation
,
where
I
find
every
thing
safe
and
quiet
;
so
I
begin
to
repose
myself
,
live
after
my
old
fashion
,
and
take
care
of
my
family
affair
;
and
for
awhile
I
live
easy
enough
;
only
that
I
be
more
vigilant
than
I
use
to
be
,
look
out
oftener
,
and
do
not
go
abroad
so
much
;
and
if
at
any
time
I
do
stir
with
any
freedom
,
it
be
always
to
the
east
part
of
the
island
,
where
I
be
pretty
well
satisfied
the
savage
never
come
,
and
where
I
could
go
without
so
many
precaution
,
and
such
a
load
of
arm
and
ammunition
as
I
always
carry
with
me
,
if
I
go
the
other
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
in
this
condition
near
two
year
more
;
but
my
unlucky
head
,
that
be
always
to
let
me
know
it
be
bear
to
make
my
body
miserable
,
be
all
these
two
year
fill
with
project
and
design
,
how
,
if
it
be
possible
,
I
may
get
away
from
this
island
;
for
sometimes
I
be
for
make
another
voyage
to
the
wreck
,
though
my
reason
tell
me
,
that
there
be
nothing
leave
there
worth
the
hazard
of
my
voyage
;
sometimes
for
a
ramble
one
way
,
sometimes
another
;
and
I
believe
verity
,
if
I
have
have
the
boat
that
I
go
from
Sallee
in
,
I
should
have
venture
to
sea
,
bind
any
where
,
I
know
not
whither
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
,
in
all
my
circumstance
,
a
memento
to
those
who
be
touch
with
that
general
plague
of
mankind
,
whence
,
for
aught
I
know
,
one
half
of
their
misery
flow
;
I
mean
,
that
of
not
be
satisfied
with
the
station
wherein
God
and
nature
hath
place
them
;
for
,
not
to
look
back
upon
my
primitive
condition
,
and
the
excellent
advice
of
my
father
,
the
opposition
to
which
be
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
my
original
sin
,
my
subsequent
mistake
of
the
same
kind
have
be
the
mean
of
my
come
into
this
miserable
condition
;
for
have
that
Providence
,
which
so
happily
have
seat
me
at
the
Brasils
as
a
planter
,
bless
me
with
confined
desire
,
and
could
I
have
be
content
to
have
go
on
gradually
<EOS>
,
I
may
have
be
by
this
time
,
I
mean
in
the
time
of
my
being
on
this
island
,
one
of
the
most
considerable
planter
in
the
Brasils
;
nay
,
I
be
persuade
,
that
by
the
improvement
I
have
make
in
that
little
time
I
live
there
,
and
the
increase
I
should
probably
have
make
if
I
have
stay
,
I
may
have
be
worth
a
hundred
thousand
moidore
;
and
what
business
have
I
to
leave
a
settle
fortune
,
well
-
stock
plantation
,
improve
and
increase
,
to
turn
supercargo
to
Guinea
,
to
fetch
Negroes
,
when
patience
and
time
would
have
so
increase
our
stock
at
home
,
that
we
could
have
buy
them
at
our
own
door
,
from
those
whose
business
it
be
to
fetch
them
?
<EOS>
and
though
it
have
cost
us
something
more
,
yet
the
difference
of
that
price
be
by
no
means
worth
save
at
<EOS>
so
great
a
hazard
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
this
be
ordinarily
the
fate
of
young
head
,
so
reflection
upon
the
folly
of
it
be
as
ordinarily
the
exercise
of
more
year
,
or
of
the
dear
-
buy
experience
of
time
;
and
so
it
be
with
me
now
;
and
yet
,
<EOS>
so
deep
have
the
mistake
take
root
in
my
temper
,
that
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
in
my
station
,
but
be
continually
pore
upon
the
mean
and
possibility
of
my
escape
from
this
place
;
and
that
I
may
,
<EOS>
with
the
great
pleasure
to
the
reader
,
bring
on
the
remain
part
of
my
story
,
it
may
not
be
improper
to
give
some
account
of
my
first
conception
on
the
subject
of
this
foolish
scheme
for
my
escape
;
and
how
,
and
upon
what
foundation
,
I
act
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
to
be
suppose
to
be
retire
into
my
castle
,
after
my
late
voyage
to
the
wreck
,
my
frigate
lay
up
,
and
secure
under
water
as
usual
,
and
my
condition
restore
to
what
it
be
before
:
<EOS>
I
have
more
wealth
,
indeed
,
than
I
have
before
,
but
be
not
at
all
the
rich
;
for
I
have
no
more
use
for
it
than
the
Indians
of
Peru
have
before
the
Spaniards
come
thither
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
night
in
the
rainy
season
in
March
,
the
four
-
and
-
twentieth
year
of
my
first
set
foot
in
this
island
of
solitariness
,
I
be
lie
in
my
bed
or
hammock
,
awake
,
and
very
well
in
health
,
have
no
pain
,
no
distemper
,
no
uneasiness
of
body
,
no
,
nor
any
uneasiness
of
mind
more
than
ordinary
,
but
could
by
no
mean
close
my
eye
,
that
is
,
so
as
to
sleep
;
no
,
not
a
wink
all
night
long
,
otherwise
than
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
impossible
as
needless
to
set
down
the
innumerable
crowd
of
thought
that
whirl
through
that
great
thoroughfare
of
the
brain
,
the
memory
,
in
this
night
's
time
:
I
run
over
the
whole
history
of
my
life
in
miniature
,
or
by
abridgment
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
to
my
coming
to
this
island
;
and
also
of
that
part
of
my
life
since
I
come
to
this
island
;
in
my
reflection
upon
the
state
of
my
case
,
since
I
come
on
shore
on
this
island
;
I
be
compare
the
happy
posture
of
my
affair
,
in
the
first
year
of
my
habitation
here
,
to
that
course
of
anxiety
,
fear
,
and
care
,
which
I
have
live
in
ever
since
I
have
see
the
print
of
a
foot
in
the
sand
;
not
that
I
do
not
believe
the
savage
have
frequent
the
island
even
all
the
while
,
and
may
have
be
several
hundred
of
them
at
time
on
the
shore
there
;
but
as
I
have
never
know
it
,
and
be
incapable
of
any
apprehension
about
it
,
my
satisfaction
be
perfect
,
though
my
danger
be
the
same
;
and
I
be
as
happy
in
not
know
my
danger
,
as
if
I
have
never
really
be
expose
to
it
;
this
furnish
my
thought
with
many
very
profitable
reflection
,
and
particularly
this
one
:
<EOS>
how
infinitely
good
that
Providence
be
,
which
have
settle
in
its
government
of
mankind
such
narrow
bound
to
his
sight
and
knowledge
of
thing
;
and
though
he
walk
in
the
midst
of
so
many
thousand
danger
,
the
sight
of
which
,
if
discover
to
him
,
would
distract
his
mind
and
sink
his
spirit
,
he
be
keep
serene
and
calm
,
by
have
the
event
of
thing
hide
from
his
eye
,
and
know
nothing
of
the
danger
which
surround
him
.
  
<EOS>
after
these
thought
have
for
some
time
entertain
me
,
I
come
to
reflect
seriously
upon
the
real
danger
I
have
be
in
for
so
many
year
in
this
very
island
;
and
how
I
have
walk
about
in
the
great
security
,
and
with
all
possible
tranquillity
,
even
perhaps
when
nothing
but
a
brow
on
a
hill
,
a
great
tree
,
or
the
casual
approach
of
night
,
have
be
between
me
and
the
bad
kind
of
destruction
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
cannibal
,
and
savage
,
who
would
have
seize
on
me
with
the
same
view
,
as
I
do
of
a
goat
,
or
a
turtle
;
and
have
think
it
no
more
a
crime
to
kill
and
devour
me
,
than
I
do
of
a
pigeon
,
or
a
curlieu
:
<EOS>
I
would
unjustly
slander
my
self
,
if
I
should
say
I
be
not
sincerely
thankful
to
my
great
preserver
,
to
whose
singular
protection
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
,
with
great
humility
,
that
all
these
unknown
deliverance
be
due
;
and
without
which
,
I
must
inevitably
have
fall
into
their
merciless
hand
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
thought
be
over
,
my
head
be
for
some
time
take
up
in
consider
the
nature
of
these
wretched
creature
;
I
mean
,
the
savage
;
and
how
it
come
to
pass
in
the
world
,
that
the
wise
governour
of
all
thing
should
give
up
any
of
his
creature
to
such
inhumanity
;
nay
,
to
something
so
much
below
,
even
brutality
it
self
,
as
to
devour
its
own
kind
;
but
as
this
end
in
some
(
at
that
time
fruitless
)
speculation
,
it
occur
to
me
to
enquire
,
what
part
of
the
world
these
wretch
live
in
<EOS>
;
how
far
off
the
coast
be
from
whence
they
come
;
what
they
venture
over
so
far
from
home
for
;
what
kind
of
boat
they
have
;
and
why
I
may
not
order
my
self
,
and
my
business
<EOS>
so
,
that
I
may
be
as
able
to
go
over
thither
,
as
they
be
to
come
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
so
much
as
troubled
my
self
to
consider
what
I
should
do
with
my
self
<EOS>
,
when
I
come
thither
;
what
would
become
of
me
,
if
I
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
savage
;
or
how
I
should
escape
from
them
,
if
they
attempt
me
;
no
,
nor
so
much
as
how
it
be
possible
for
me
to
reach
the
coast
,
and
not
be
attempt
by
some
or
other
of
them
,
without
any
possibility
of
deliver
my
self
;
and
if
I
should
not
fall
into
their
hand
,
what
I
should
do
for
provision
,
or
whither
<EOS>
I
should
bend
my
course
;
none
of
these
thought
,
I
say
,
so
much
as
come
in
my
way
;
but
my
mind
be
wholly
bent
upon
the
notion
of
my
passing
over
in
my
boat
,
to
the
main
land
<EOS>
:
I
look
back
upon
my
present
condition
as
the
most
miserable
that
could
possibly
be
;
that
I
be
not
able
to
throw
myself
into
any
thing
but
death
that
could
be
call
bad
;
that
if
I
reach
the
shore
of
the
main
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
meet
with
relief
;
or
I
may
coast
along
,
as
I
do
on
the
shore
of
Africa
,
till
I
come
to
some
inhabit
country
,
and
where
I
may
find
some
relief
;
and
after
all
,
perhaps
,
I
may
fall
in
with
some
christian
ship
that
may
take
me
in
:
and
if
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
I
could
but
die
,
which
would
put
an
end
to
all
these
misery
at
once
.
<EOS>
pray
,
note
all
this
be
the
fruit
of
a
disturbed
mind
,
an
impatient
temper
,
make
,
as
it
be
,
desperate
by
the
long
continuance
of
my
trouble
,
and
the
disappointment
I
have
meet
in
the
wreck
I
have
be
on
board
of
,
and
where
I
have
be
so
near
the
obtaining
of
what
I
so
earnestly
long
for
,
viz
.
<EOS>
somebody
to
speak
to
,
and
to
learn
some
knowledge
from
of
the
place
where
I
be
,
and
of
the
probable
mean
of
my
deliverance
;
I
say
,
I
be
agitate
wholly
by
these
thought
.
<EOS>
all
my
calm
of
mind
in
my
resignation
to
Providence
,
and
wait
the
issue
of
the
disposition
of
Heaven
,
seem
to
be
suspend
;
and
I
have
,
as
it
be
,
no
power
to
turn
my
thought
to
any
thing
but
the
project
of
a
voyage
to
the
main
;
which
come
upon
me
with
such
force
,
and
such
an
impetuosity
of
desire
,
that
it
be
not
to
be
resist
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
have
agitate
my
thought
for
two
hour
or
more
,
with
such
violence
that
it
set
my
very
blood
into
a
ferment
,
and
my
pulse
beat
as
high
as
if
I
have
be
in
a
fever
,
merely
with
the
extraordinary
fervour
of
my
mind
about
it
;
<EOS>
nature
,
as
if
I
have
be
fatigue
and
exhaust
with
the
very
thought
of
it
,
throw
me
into
a
sound
sleep
:
one
would
have
think
I
should
have
dream
of
it
;
but
I
do
not
,
nor
of
any
thing
relate
to
it
;
but
I
dream
,
that
as
I
be
go
out
in
the
morning
,
as
usual
,
from
my
castle
,
I
see
upon
the
shore
two
canoe
and
eleven
savage
come
to
land
,
and
that
they
bring
with
them
another
savage
,
whom
they
be
go
to
kill
,
in
order
to
eat
him
;
when
on
a
sudden
,
the
savage
that
they
be
go
to
kill
jump
away
,
and
run
for
his
life
:
then
I
think
in
my
sleep
,
that
he
come
run
into
my
little
thick
grove
,
before
my
fortification
,
to
hide
himself
;
and
that
I
see
him
alone
,
and
not
perceive
that
the
other
seek
him
that
way
,
shew
myself
to
him
,
and
,
smile
upon
him
,
encourage
him
:
that
he
kneel
down
to
me
,
seem
to
pray
me
to
assist
him
;
upon
which
I
shew
my
ladder
,
make
him
go
up
it
,
and
carry
him
into
my
cave
,
and
he
become
my
servant
;
and
that
as
soon
as
I
have
get
this
man
,
I
say
to
myself
,
"
now
I
may
certainly
venture
to
the
main
land
;
for
this
fellow
will
serve
me
as
a
pilot
,
and
will
tell
me
what
to
do
,
and
whither
to
go
for
provision
,
and
whither
not
to
go
for
fear
of
be
devour
;
what
place
to
venture
into
,
and
what
to
escape
.
<EOS>
"
I
wake
with
this
thought
,
and
be
under
such
inexpressible
impression
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
my
escape
in
my
dream
,
that
the
disappointment
which
I
feel
upon
come
to
myself
,
and
find
it
be
no
more
than
a
dream
,
be
equally
extravagant
the
other
way
,
and
throw
me
into
a
very
great
dejection
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
however
,
I
make
this
conclusion
,
that
my
only
way
to
go
about
an
attempt
for
an
escape
,
be
,
if
possible
,
to
get
a
savage
in
my
possession
;
and
,
if
possible
,
it
should
be
one
of
their
prisoner
whom
they
have
condemn
to
be
eat
,
and
should
bring
hither
to
kill
:
but
these
thought
still
be
attend
with
this
difficulty
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
effect
this
,
without
attack
a
whole
caravan
of
them
,
and
kill
them
all
;
and
this
be
not
only
a
very
desperate
attempt
,
and
may
miscarry
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
have
greatly
scruple
the
lawfulness
of
it
to
me
,
and
my
heart
tremble
at
the
thought
of
shed
so
much
blood
,
though
it
be
for
my
deliverance
:
<EOS>
I
need
not
repeat
the
argument
which
occur
to
me
against
this
,
they
be
the
same
mention
before
:
<EOS>
but
though
I
have
other
reason
to
offer
now
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
those
man
be
enemy
to
my
life
,
and
would
devour
me
,
if
they
could
;
that
it
be
self
-
preservation
,
in
the
high
degree
,
to
deliver
myself
from
this
death
of
a
life
,
and
be
act
in
my
own
defence
,
as
much
as
if
they
be
actually
assault
me
,
and
the
like
;
I
say
,
though
these
thing
argue
for
it
,
yet
the
thought
of
shed
human
blood
for
my
deliverance
be
very
terrible
to
me
,
and
such
as
I
could
by
no
means
reconcile
myself
to
a
great
while
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
,
after
many
secret
dispute
with
myself
,
and
after
great
perplexity
about
it
,
(
for
all
these
argument
,
one
way
and
another
,
struggle
in
my
head
a
long
time
,
)
the
eager
prevailing
desire
of
deliverance
at
length
master
all
the
rest
,
and
I
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
get
one
of
these
savage
into
my
band
,
cost
what
it
would
:
the
next
thing
then
be
to
contrive
how
to
do
it
;
and
this
indeed
be
very
difficult
to
resolve
on
:
<EOS>
but
as
I
could
pitch
upon
no
probable
mean
for
it
,
so
I
resolve
to
put
myself
upon
the
watch
to
see
them
when
they
come
on
shore
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
event
,
take
such
measure
as
the
opportunity
should
present
,
let
it
be
what
it
would
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
resolution
in
my
thought
,
I
set
myself
upon
the
scout
as
often
as
possible
,
and
indeed
so
often
,
till
I
be
heartily
tired
of
it
;
for
it
be
above
a
year
and
a
half
that
I
wait
,
and
for
a
great
part
of
that
time
go
out
to
the
west
end
,
and
to
the
south
-
west
corner
of
the
island
,
almost
every
day
,
to
see
the
canoe
,
but
none
appear
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
discouraging
,
and
begin
to
trouble
me
much
;
though
I
can
not
say
that
it
do
in
this
case
,
as
it
have
do
some
time
before
that
,
viz
.
<EOS>
wear
off
the
edge
of
my
desire
to
the
thing
;
but
the
long
it
seem
to
be
delay
,
the
more
eager
I
be
for
it
:
in
a
word
,
I
be
not
at
first
more
careful
to
shun
the
sight
of
these
savage
,
and
avoid
be
see
by
them
,
than
I
be
now
eager
to
be
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
I
fancy
myself
able
to
manage
one
,
nay
,
two
or
three
savage
,
if
I
have
them
,
so
as
to
make
them
entirely
slave
to
me
,
to
do
whatever
I
should
direct
them
,
and
to
prevent
their
be
able
,
at
any
time
,
to
do
me
any
hurt
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
while
that
I
please
myself
with
this
affair
,
but
nothing
still
present
;
all
my
fancy
and
scheme
come
to
nothing
,
for
no
savage
come
near
me
for
a
great
while
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
I
have
entertain
these
notion
,
and
,
by
long
musing
,
have
,
as
it
be
,
resolve
them
all
into
nothing
,
for
want
of
an
occasion
to
put
them
in
execution
<EOS>
,
I
be
surprised
one
morning
early
,
with
see
no
less
than
five
canoe
all
on
shore
together
,
on
my
side
the
island
,
and
the
people
who
belong
to
them
all
land
,
and
out
of
my
sight
:
the
number
of
them
break
all
my
measure
;
for
see
so
many
,
and
know
that
they
always
come
four
,
or
six
,
or
sometimes
more
,
in
a
boat
,
I
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
,
or
how
to
take
my
measure
,
to
attack
twenty
or
thirty
man
single
-
handed
;
so
I
lay
still
in
my
castle
,
perplex
and
discomforte
;
however
,
I
put
myself
into
all
the
same
posture
for
an
attack
that
I
have
formerly
provide
,
and
be
just
ready
for
action
,
if
any
thing
have
present
.
<EOS>
have
wait
a
good
while
,
listen
to
hear
if
they
make
any
noise
;
at
length
be
very
impatient
,
I
set
my
gun
at
the
foot
of
my
ladder
,
and
clamber
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
by
my
two
stage
,
as
usual
,
stand
so
,
however
,
that
my
head
do
not
appear
above
the
hill
,
so
that
they
could
not
perceive
me
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
here
I
observe
,
by
the
help
of
my
perspective
glass
,
that
they
be
no
less
than
thirty
in
number
;
that
they
have
a
fire
kindle
,
and
that
they
have
have
meat
dress
;
how
they
cook
it
,
that
I
know
not
,
or
what
it
be
;
but
they
be
all
dance
in
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
many
barbarous
gesture
and
figure
,
their
own
way
,
round
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
thus
look
on
them
,
I
perceive
by
my
perspective
two
miserable
wretch
drag
from
the
boat
,
where
,
it
seem
,
they
be
lay
by
,
and
be
now
bring
out
for
the
slaughter
:
I
perceive
one
of
them
immediately
fall
,
be
knock
down
,
I
suppose
,
with
a
club
or
wooden
sword
,
for
that
be
their
way
;
and
two
or
three
other
be
at
work
immediately
,
cut
him
open
for
their
cookery
,
while
the
other
victim
be
leave
stand
by
himself
,
till
they
should
be
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
in
that
very
moment
this
poor
wretch
,
see
himself
a
little
at
liberty
<EOS>
,
nature
inspire
him
with
hope
of
life
,
and
he
start
away
from
them
,
and
run
with
incredible
swiftness
along
the
sand
,
directly
towards
me
,
I
mean
towards
that
part
of
the
coast
where
my
habitation
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
dreadfully
fright
(
that
I
must
acknowledge
)
when
I
perceive
him
to
run
my
way
;
and
especially
when
,
as
I
think
,
I
see
him
pursue
by
the
whole
body
;
and
now
I
expect
that
part
of
my
dream
be
come
to
pass
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
take
shelter
in
my
grove
;
but
I
could
not
depend
,
by
any
mean
,
upon
my
dream
for
the
rest
of
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
other
savage
would
not
pursue
him
thither
,
and
find
him
there
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
keep
my
station
,
and
my
spirit
begin
to
recover
,
when
I
find
that
there
be
not
above
three
man
that
follow
him
;
and
still
more
be
I
encourage
,
when
I
find
that
he
out
-
stript
them
exceedingly
in
run
,
and
gain
ground
of
them
,
so
that
if
he
could
but
hold
it
for
half
an
hour
<EOS>
,
I
see
easily
he
would
fairly
get
away
from
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
between
them
and
my
castle
the
creek
,
which
I
mention
often
at
the
first
part
of
my
story
,
when
I
land
my
cargo
out
of
the
ship
;
and
this
I
know
he
must
necessarily
swim
over
,
or
the
poor
wretch
would
be
take
there
:
but
when
the
savage
escaping
come
thither
,
he
make
nothing
of
it
,
though
the
tide
be
then
up
;
but
plunge
in
,
swam
through
in
about
thirty
stroke
,
or
thereabout
,
land
,
and
run
on
with
exceed
strength
and
swiftness
.
<EOS>
when
the
three
pursuer
come
to
the
creek
,
I
find
that
two
of
them
could
swim
,
but
the
third
could
not
,
and
that
he
,
stand
on
the
other
side
,
look
at
the
other
,
but
go
no
farther
;
and
soon
after
go
softly
back
again
,
which
,
as
it
happen
,
be
very
well
for
him
in
the
main
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
,
that
the
two
who
swam
be
yet
more
than
twice
as
long
swimming
over
the
creek
than
the
fellow
be
that
flee
from
them
.
<EOS>
It
come
now
very
warmly
upon
my
thought
,
and
indeed
irresistibly
,
that
now
be
my
time
to
get
a
servant
,
and
perhaps
a
companion
,
or
assistant
,
and
that
I
be
call
plainly
by
Providence
to
save
this
poor
creature
's
life
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
get
down
the
ladder
with
all
possible
expedition
,
fetch
my
two
gun
,
for
they
be
both
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
,
as
I
observe
above
;
and
get
up
again
with
the
same
haste
to
the
top
of
the
hill
<EOS>
,
I
cross
towards
the
sea
;
and
have
a
very
short
cut
,
and
all
down
hill
,
clap
myself
in
the
way
between
the
pursuer
and
the
pursued
,
halloo
aloud
to
him
that
flee
,
who
,
look
back
,
be
at
first
perhaps
as
much
fright
at
me
as
at
them
;
but
I
beckon
with
my
hand
to
him
to
come
back
;
and
in
the
meantime
I
slowly
advance
towards
the
two
that
follow
;
then
rush
at
once
upon
the
foremost
,
I
knock
him
down
with
the
stock
of
my
piece
;
I
be
loath
to
fire
,
because
I
would
not
have
the
rest
hear
,
though
at
that
distance
it
would
not
have
be
easily
hear
;
and
be
out
of
sigh
of
the
smoke
too
,
they
would
not
have
easily
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
knock
this
fellow
down
,
the
other
who
pursue
him
stop
,
as
if
he
have
be
frighten
,
and
I
advance
apace
towards
him
;
but
as
I
come
nearer
,
I
perceive
<EOS>
presently
he
have
a
bow
and
arrow
,
and
be
fit
it
to
shoot
at
me
;
so
I
be
then
necessitate
to
shoot
at
him
first
;
which
I
do
,
and
kill
him
at
the
first
shot
.
<EOS>
the
poor
savage
who
flee
,
but
have
stop
,
though
he
see
both
his
enemy
fall
,
and
kill
,
(
as
he
think
)
yet
be
so
fright
with
the
fire
and
noise
of
my
piece
,
that
he
stand
stock
-
still
,
and
neither
come
forward
,
nor
go
backward
,
though
he
seem
rather
inclined
to
fly
still
,
than
to
come
on
.
<EOS>
I
halloo
again
to
him
,
and
make
sign
to
come
forward
,
which
he
easily
understand
,
and
come
a
little
way
,
then
stop
again
,
and
then
a
little
farther
,
and
stop
again
;
and
I
could
then
perceive
that
he
stand
tremble
,
as
if
he
have
be
take
prisoner
,
and
have
just
be
to
be
kill
,
as
his
two
enemy
be
.
<EOS>
I
beckon
him
again
to
come
to
me
,
and
give
him
all
the
sign
of
encouragement
that
I
could
think
of
;
and
he
come
nearer
and
nearer
,
kneel
down
every
ten
or
twelve
step
,
in
token
of
acknowledgment
for
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
smile
at
him
,
and
look
pleasantly
,
and
beckon
to
him
to
come
still
near
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
come
close
to
me
,
and
then
he
kneel
down
again
,
kiss
the
ground
,
and
lay
his
head
upon
the
ground
,
and
take
me
by
the
foot
,
set
my
foot
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
this
,
it
seem
,
be
in
token
of
swear
to
be
my
slave
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
take
him
up
,
and
make
much
of
him
,
and
encourage
him
all
I
could
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
more
work
to
do
yet
;
for
I
perceive
the
savage
,
whom
I
knock
down
,
be
not
kill
,
but
stun
with
the
blow
,
and
begin
to
come
to
himself
:
so
I
point
to
him
,
and
show
him
the
savage
,
that
he
be
not
dead
:
upon
this
he
speak
some
word
to
me
;
and
though
I
could
not
understand
them
,
yet
I
think
they
be
pleasant
to
hear
,
for
they
be
the
first
sound
of
a
man
's
voice
that
I
have
hear
,
my
own
except
,
for
above
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
time
for
such
reflection
now
:
the
savage
,
who
be
knock
down
,
recover
himself
so
far
as
to
sit
up
upon
the
ground
;
and
I
perceive
that
my
savage
begin
to
be
afraid
;
but
when
I
see
that
,
I
present
my
other
piece
at
the
man
,
as
if
I
would
shoot
him
:
upon
this
my
savage
,
for
<EOS>
so
I
call
him
now
,
make
a
motion
to
me
to
lend
him
my
sword
,
which
hang
naked
in
a
belt
by
my
side
:
<EOS>
so
I
do
:
<EOS>
he
no
sooner
have
it
,
but
he
run
to
his
enemy
,
and
at
one
blow
cut
off
his
head
so
cleverly
,
no
executioner
in
Germany
could
have
do
it
sooner
or
better
;
which
I
think
very
strange
for
one
,
who
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
,
never
see
a
sword
in
his
life
before
,
except
their
own
wooden
sword
:
however
,
it
seem
,
as
I
learn
afterwards
,
they
make
their
wooden
sword
so
sharp
,
so
heavy
,
and
<EOS>
the
wood
be
so
hard
,
that
they
will
cut
off
head
even
with
them
,
nay
,
and
arm
,
and
that
at
one
blow
too
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
this
,
he
come
laugh
to
me
in
sign
of
triumph
,
and
bring
me
the
sword
again
,
and
,
with
abundance
of
gesture
,
which
I
do
not
understand
,
lay
it
down
,
with
the
head
of
the
savage
that
he
have
kill
,
just
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
astonish
him
most
be
,
to
know
how
I
have
kill
the
other
Indian
so
far
off
;
<EOS>
so
point
to
him
,
he
make
sign
to
me
to
let
him
go
to
him
:
<EOS>
so
I
bade
him
go
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
him
,
he
stand
like
one
amazed
,
look
at
him
;
turn
him
first
on
one
side
,
then
on
t'other
;
look
at
the
wound
the
bullet
have
make
,
which
it
seem
be
just
in
his
breast
,
where
it
have
make
a
hole
,
and
no
great
quantity
of
blood
have
follow
;
but
he
have
bleed
inwardly
,
for
he
be
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
up
his
bow
and
arrow
,
and
come
back
;
so
I
turn
to
go
away
,
and
beckon
him
to
follow
me
,
make
sign
to
him
that
more
may
come
after
them
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
he
sign
to
me
,
that
he
should
bury
them
with
sand
,
that
they
may
not
he
see
by
the
rest
,
if
they
follow
;
and
so
I
make
sign
again
to
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
fall
to
work
,
and
in
an
instant
he
have
scrape
a
hole
in
the
sand
with
his
hand
,
big
enough
to
bury
the
first
in
,
and
then
drag
him
into
it
,
and
cover
him
,
and
do
so
also
by
the
other
;
I
believe
he
have
bury
them
both
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
:
then
call
him
away
,
I
carry
him
not
to
my
castle
,
but
quite
away
to
my
cave
,
on
the
farther
part
of
the
island
;
so
I
do
not
let
my
dream
come
to
pass
in
that
part
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
he
come
into
my
grove
for
shelter
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
give
him
bread
and
a
bunch
of
raisin
to
eat
,
and
a
draught
of
water
,
which
I
find
he
be
indeed
in
great
distress
for
,
by
his
running
;
and
have
refresh
him
,
I
make
sign
for
him
to
go
lie
down
and
sleep
,
point
to
a
place
where
I
have
lay
a
great
parcel
of
rice
-
straw
,
and
a
blanket
upon
it
,
which
I
use
to
sleep
upon
myself
sometimes
;
so
the
poor
creature
lie
down
,
and
go
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
comely
handsome
fellow
,
perfectly
well
make
,
with
straight
long
limb
,
not
too
large
,
tall
,
and
well
-
shape
,
and
,
as
I
reckon
,
about
twenty
-
six
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
good
countenance
,
not
a
fierce
and
surly
aspect
,
but
seem
to
have
something
very
manly
in
his
face
,
and
yet
he
have
all
the
sweetness
and
softness
of
an
European
in
his
countenance
too
,
especially
when
he
smile
:
his
hair
be
long
and
black
,
not
curl
like
wool
;
his
forehead
very
high
and
large
,
and
a
great
vivacity
and
sparkle
sharpness
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
colour
of
his
skin
be
not
quite
black
,
but
very
tawny
,
and
yet
not
of
an
ugly
yellow
nauseous
tawny
,
as
the
Brasilians
and
Virginians
,
and
other
native
of
America
be
,
but
of
a
bright
kind
of
a
dun
olive
colour
,
that
have
in
it
something
very
agreeable
,
though
not
very
easy
to
describe
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
round
and
plump
,
his
nose
small
,
not
flat
like
the
Negroe
's
,
a
very
good
mouth
,
thin
lip
,
and
his
tooth
fine
,
well
-
set
,
and
white
as
ivory
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
slumber
,
rather
than
sleep
,
about
half
an
hour
,
he
wake
again
,
and
come
out
of
the
cave
to
me
,
for
I
have
be
milk
my
goat
,
which
I
have
in
the
enclosure
just
by
:
<EOS>
when
he
espy
me
,
he
come
run
to
me
,
lay
himself
down
again
upon
the
ground
,
with
all
the
possible
sign
of
an
humble
thankful
disposition
,
make
many
,
antic
gesture
to
shew
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
lay
his
head
flat
upon
the
ground
,
close
to
my
foot
,
and
set
my
other
foot
upon
his
head
,
as
he
have
do
before
;
and
after
this
,
make
all
the
sign
to
me
of
subjection
,
servitude
,
and
submission
imaginable
,
to
let
me
know
how
much
he
would
serve
me
as
long
as
he
live
.
<EOS>
I
understand
him
in
many
thing
,
and
let
him
know
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
I
begin
to
speak
to
him
,
and
teach
him
to
speak
to
me
;
and
first
,
I
make
him
know
his
name
should
be
Friday
,
which
be
the
day
I
save
his
life
;
and
I
call
him
so
for
the
memory
of
the
time
;
I
likewise
teach
him
to
say
Master
,
and
then
let
him
know
that
be
to
be
my
name
<EOS>
;
I
likewise
teach
him
to
say
yes
<EOS>
and
no
,
and
to
know
the
meaning
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
some
milk
in
an
earthen
pot
,
and
let
him
see
me
drink
it
before
him
,
and
sop
my
bread
in
it
;
and
I
give
him
a
cake
of
bread
to
do
the
like
,
which
he
quickly
comply
with
,
and
make
sign
that
it
be
very
good
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
there
with
him
all
that
night
;
but
as
soon
as
it
be
day
,
I
beckon
him
to
come
with
me
,
and
let
him
know
I
would
give
him
some
clothe
;
at
which
he
seem
very
glad
,
for
he
be
stark
-
naked
.
<EOS>
as
we
go
by
the
place
where
he
have
bury
the
two
man
,
he
point
exactly
to
the
spot
,
and
shew
me
the
mark
that
he
have
make
to
find
them
again
,
make
sign
to
me
that
we
should
dig
them
up
again
,
and
eat
them
:
at
this
I
appear
very
angry
,
express
my
abhorrence
of
it
,
make
as
if
I
would
vomit
at
the
thought
of
it
,
and
beckon
with
my
hand
to
him
to
come
away
,
which
he
do
immediately
,
with
great
submission
.
<EOS>
I
then
lead
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
to
see
if
his
enemy
be
go
,
and
pull
out
my
glass
,
I
look
,
and
see
plainly
the
place
where
they
have
be
,
but
no
appearance
of
them
,
or
of
their
canoe
;
so
that
it
be
plain
that
they
be
go
,
and
have
leave
their
two
comrade
behind
them
,
without
,
any
search
after
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
content
with
this
discovery
;
but
have
now
more
courage
,
and
consequently
more
curiosity
,
I
take
my
man
Friday
with
me
,
give
him
the
sword
in
his
hand
,
with
the
bow
and
arrow
at
his
back
,
which
I
find
he
could
use
very
dexterously
,
make
him
carry
one
gun
for
me
,
and
I
two
for
myself
,
and
away
we
march
to
the
place
where
these
creature
have
be
;
for
I
have
a
mind
now
to
get
some
further
intelligence
of
them
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
place
,
my
very
blood
run
chill
in
my
vein
,
and
my
heart
sink
within
me
at
the
horror
of
the
spectacle
:
indeed
it
be
a
dreadful
sight
<EOS>
,
at
least
it
be
so
to
me
,
though
Friday
make
nothing
of
it
:
the
place
be
cover
with
human
bone
,
the
ground
dye
with
the
blood
,
great
piece
of
flesh
leave
here
and
there
,
half
-
eat
,
mangle
,
and
scorch
;
and
,
in
short
,
all
the
token
of
the
triumphant
feast
they
have
be
make
there
,
after
a
victory
over
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
see
three
skull
,
five
hand
,
and
the
bone
of
three
or
four
leg
and
foot
,
and
abundance
of
other
part
of
the
body
;
and
Friday
,
by
his
sign
,
make
me
understand
that
they
bring
over
four
prisoner
to
feast
upon
;
that
three
of
them
be
eat
up
,
and
that
he
,
point
to
himself
,
be
the
fourth
;
that
there
have
be
a
great
battle
between
them
and
their
next
king
,
whose
subject
,
it
seem
,
he
have
be
one
of
;
and
that
they
have
take
a
great
number
of
prisoner
,
all
which
be
carry
to
several
place
by
those
that
have
take
them
in
the
flight
,
in
order
to
feast
upon
them
,
as
be
do
here
by
these
wretch
upon
those
they
bring
hither
.
  
<EOS>
I
cause
Friday
to
gather
all
the
skull
,
bone
,
flesh
,
and
whatever
remain
,
and
lie
them
together
on
an
heap
,
and
make
a
great
fire
upon
it
,
and
burn
them
all
to
ashe
.
<EOS>
I
find
Friday
have
still
a
hanker
stomach
after
some
of
the
flesh
,
and
be
still
a
cannibal
in
his
nature
;
but
I
discover
so
much
abhorrence
at
the
very
thought
of
it
,
and
at
the
least
appearance
of
it
,
that
he
durst
not
discover
it
;
for
I
have
,
by
some
mean
,
let
him
know
that
I
would
kill
him
if
he
offer
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
do
this
,
we
come
back
to
our
castle
,
and
there
I
fall
to
work
for
my
man
Friday
;
and
first
of
all
,
I
give
him
a
pair
of
linen
drawer
,
which
I
have
out
of
the
poor
gunner
's
chest
I
mention
,
and
which
I
find
in
the
wreck
;
and
which
,
with
a
little
alteration
,
fit
him
very
well
;
then
I
make
him
a
jerkin
of
goat
's
skin
as
well
as
my
skill
would
allow
,
and
I
be
now
grow
a
tolerable
good
tailor
;
and
I
give
him
a
cap
,
which
I
have
make
of
a
hare
-
skin
,
very
convenient
,
and
fashionable
enough
:
and
thus
he
be
dress
,
for
the
present
,
tolerably
well
,
and
<EOS>
mighty
well
be
he
pleased
to
see
himself
almost
as
well
clothe
as
his
master
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
he
go
awkwardly
in
these
thing
at
first
;
wear
the
drawer
be
very
awkward
to
him
,
and
the
sleeve
of
the
waistcoat
gall
his
shoulder
and
the
inside
of
his
arm
;
but
a
little
ease
them
,
where
he
complain
they
hurt
him
,
and
use
himself
to
them
,
at
length
he
take
to
them
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
after
I
come
home
to
my
hutch
with
him
,
I
begin
to
consider
where
I
should
lodge
him
;
and
that
I
may
do
well
for
him
,
and
yet
be
perfectly
easy
myself
,
I
make
a
little
tent
for
him
in
the
vacant
place
between
my
two
fortification
,
in
the
inside
of
the
last
,
and
in
the
outside
of
the
first
:
and
as
there
be
a
door
or
entrance
there
into
my
cave
,
I
make
a
formal
framed
door
-
case
,
and
a
door
to
it
of
board
,
and
set
it
up
in
the
passage
,
a
little
within
the
entrance
:
and
cause
the
door
to
open
on
the
inside
,
I
bar
it
up
in
the
night
,
take
in
my
ladder
too
;
so
that
Friday
could
no
way
come
at
me
in
the
inside
of
my
innermost
wall
,
without
make
so
much
noise
in
get
over
,
that
it
must
needs
awaken
me
;
for
my
first
wall
have
now
a
complete
roof
over
it
of
long
pole
,
cover
all
my
tent
,
and
lean
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
which
be
again
lay
cross
with
small
stick
instead
of
lath
,
and
then
thatch
over
a
great
thickness
with
the
rice
straw
,
which
be
strong
like
reed
;
and
at
the
hole
or
place
which
be
leave
to
go
in
or
out
by
the
ladder
,
I
have
place
a
kind
of
trapdoor
,
which
if
it
have
be
attempt
on
the
outside
,
would
not
have
open
at
all
,
but
would
have
fall
down
,
and
make
a
great
noise
;
and
as
to
weapon
,
I
take
them
all
in
to
my
side
every
night
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
need
none
of
all
this
precaution
;
for
never
man
have
<EOS>
a
more
faithful
,
loving
,
sincere
servant
than
Friday
be
to
me
;
without
passion
,
sullenness
,
or
design
;
perfectly
oblige
and
engage
;
his
very
affection
be
tie
to
me
,
like
those
of
a
child
to
a
father
;
and
I
dare
say
,
he
would
have
sacrifice
his
life
for
the
saving
mine
,
upon
any
occasion
whatsoever
:
the
many
testimony
he
give
me
of
this
put
it
out
of
doubt
;
and
soon
convince
me
,
that
I
need
to
use
no
precaution
as
to
my
safety
on
his
account
.
  
<EOS>
this
frequently
give
me
occasion
to
observe
,
and
that
with
wonder
,
that
,
however
it
have
please
God
in
his
providence
,
and
in
the
government
of
the
work
of
his
hand
,
to
take
from
<EOS>
so
great
a
part
of
the
world
of
his
creature
the
good
use
to
which
their
faculty
,
and
the
power
of
their
soul
,
be
adapt
;
yet
that
he
have
bestow
upon
them
the
same
power
,
the
same
reason
,
the
same
affection
,
the
same
sentiment
of
kindness
and
obligation
,
the
same
passion
and
resentment
of
wrong
,
the
same
sense
of
gratitude
,
sincerity
,
fidelity
,
and
all
the
capacity
of
do
good
,
and
receive
good
,
that
he
have
give
to
us
;
and
that
when
he
please
to
offer
them
occasion
of
exert
these
,
they
be
as
ready
,
nay
more
ready
,
to
apply
them
to
the
right
use
for
which
they
be
bestow
,
than
we
be
.
<EOS>
and
this
make
me
very
melancholy
sometimes
,
in
reflect
,
as
the
several
occasion
present
,
how
mean
a
use
we
make
of
all
these
,
even
though
we
have
these
power
enlighten
by
the
great
lamp
of
instruction
,
the
Spirit
of
God
,
and
by
the
knowledge
of
his
word
,
add
to
our
understanding
;
and
why
it
have
please
God
to
hide
the
life
save
knowledge
from
so
many
million
of
soul
,
who
,
if
I
may
judge
by
this
poor
savage
,
would
make
a
much
well
use
of
it
than
we
do
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
I
sometimes
be
lead
too
far
to
invade
the
sovereignty
of
Providence
;
and
,
as
it
be
,
arraign
the
justice
of
so
arbitrary
a
disposition
of
thing
,
that
should
hide
that
light
from
some
,
and
reveal
it
to
other
,
and
yet
expect
a
like
duty
from
both
:
<EOS>
but
I
shut
it
up
,
and
check
my
thought
with
this
conclusion
:
first
,
that
we
do
not
know
by
what
light
and
law
<EOS>
these
should
be
condemn
;
but
that
as
God
be
necessarily
,
and
by
the
nature
of
his
being
,
infinitely
holy
and
just
,
so
it
could
not
be
,
but
that
if
these
creature
be
all
sentence
to
absence
from
himself
,
it
be
on
account
of
sin
against
that
light
,
which
,
as
the
scripture
say
,
be
a
law
to
themselves
,
and
by
such
rule
as
their
conscience
would
acknowledge
to
be
just
,
though
the
foundation
be
not
discover
to
us
:
and
,
secondly
,
that
still
,
as
we
be
all
clay
in
the
hand
of
the
potter
,
no
vessel
could
say
to
him
,
"
why
hast
thou
form
me
thus
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
new
companion
:
I
be
greatly
delighted
with
him
,
and
make
it
my
business
to
teach
him
every
thing
that
be
proper
to
make
him
useful
,
handy
,
and
helpful
;
but
especially
to
make
him
speak
,
and
understand
me
when
I
spake
:
and
he
be
the
apt
scholar
that
ever
be
;
and
particularly
be
so
merry
,
so
constantly
diligent
,
and
so
pleased
when
he
could
but
understand
me
,
or
make
me
understand
him
,
that
it
be
very
pleasant
to
me
to
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
my
life
begin
to
be
so
easy
,
that
I
begin
to
say
to
myself
,
that
could
I
but
<EOS>
have
be
safe
from
more
savage
,
I
care
not
if
I
be
never
to
remove
from
the
place
while
I
live
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
be
two
or
three
day
return
to
my
castle
,
I
think
,
that
,
in
order
to
bring
Friday
off
from
his
horrid
way
of
feeding
,
and
from
the
relish
of
a
cannibal
's
stomach
,
I
ought
to
let
him
taste
other
flesh
;
so
I
take
him
out
with
me
one
morning
to
the
wood
:
I
go
,
indeed
,
intend
to
kill
a
kid
out
of
my
own
flock
,
and
bring
it
home
and
dress
it
:
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
go
,
I
see
a
she
goat
lie
down
in
the
shade
,
and
two
young
kid
sit
by
her
.
<EOS>
I
catch
hold
of
Friday
:
"
hold
,
"
say
I
,
"
stand
still
;
"
and
make
sign
to
him
not
to
stir
.
<EOS>
immediately
I
present
my
piece
,
shoot
and
kill
one
of
the
kid
.
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
,
who
have
,
at
a
distance
indeed
,
see
me
kill
the
savage
his
enemy
,
but
do
not
know
,
or
could
imagine
how
it
be
do
,
be
sensibly
surprised
,
tremble
and
shake
,
and
look
so
amazed
,
that
I
think
he
would
have
sink
down
:
he
do
not
see
the
kid
I
have
shoot
at
,
or
perceive
I
have
kill
it
,
but
rip
up
his
waistcoat
to
feel
if
he
be
not
wound
;
and
,
as
I
find
,
presently
think
I
be
resolve
to
kill
him
:
for
he
come
and
kneel
down
to
me
,
and
,
embrace
my
knee
,
say
a
great
many
thing
I
do
not
understand
<EOS>
but
I
could
easily
see
that
his
meaning
be
to
pray
me
not
to
kill
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
find
a
way
to
convince
him
,
that
I
would
do
him
no
harm
;
and
take
him
up
by
the
hand
,
laugh
at
him
,
and
point
to
the
kid
which
I
have
kill
,
beckon
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
it
,
which
he
do
:
and
while
he
be
wonder
and
look
to
see
how
the
creature
be
kill
,
I
load
my
gun
again
,
and
by
and
by
I
see
a
great
fowl
,
like
a
hawk
,
sit
upon
a
tree
within
shot
;
so
,
to
let
Friday
understand
a
little
what
I
would
do
,
I
call
him
to
me
again
,
point
at
the
fowl
,
which
be
indeed
a
parrot
,
though
I
think
it
have
be
a
hawk
<EOS>
:
I
say
,
point
to
the
parrot
,
and
to
my
gun
,
and
to
the
ground
under
the
parrot
,
to
let
him
see
I
would
make
him
fall
,
I
make
him
understand
that
I
would
shoot
and
kill
that
bird
;
accordingly
I
fire
,
and
bid
him
look
,
and
immediately
he
see
the
parrot
fall
;
he
stand
like
one
fright
again
,
notwithstanding
all
that
I
have
say
to
him
;
and
I
find
he
be
the
more
amazed
,
because
he
do
not
see
me
put
any
thing
into
the
gun
;
but
think
there
must
be
some
wonderful
fund
of
death
and
destruction
in
that
thing
,
able
to
kill
man
,
beast
,
bird
,
or
any
thing
near
or
far
off
;
for
the
astonishment
this
create
in
him
be
such
,
as
could
not
wear
off
for
a
long
time
;
and
I
believe
,
if
I
would
have
let
him
,
he
would
have
worship
me
and
my
gun
;
as
for
the
gun
itself
,
he
would
not
so
much
as
touch
it
for
several
day
over
;
but
would
speak
to
it
,
and
talk
to
it
,
as
if
it
have
answer
him
,
when
he
be
by
himself
;
which
,
as
I
afterwards
learn
of
him
,
be
to
desire
it
not
to
kill
him
.
  
<EOS>
well
;
after
his
astonishment
be
a
little
over
at
this
,
I
point
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
the
bird
I
have
shoot
,
which
he
do
,
but
staid
some
time
;
for
the
parrot
,
not
be
quite
dead
,
have
flutter
a
good
way
off
from
the
place
where
she
fall
;
however
,
he
find
her
,
take
her
up
,
and
bring
her
to
me
;
and
,
as
I
have
perceive
his
ignorance
about
the
gun
before
<EOS>
,
I
take
this
advantage
to
charge
the
gun
again
,
and
not
let
him
see
me
do
it
,
that
I
may
he
ready
for
any
other
mark
that
may
present
;
but
nothing
more
offer
at
that
time
;
so
I
bring
home
the
kid
;
and
the
same
evening
<EOS>
I
take
the
skin
off
,
and
cut
it
out
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
have
a
pot
for
that
purpose
,
I
boil
or
stew
some
of
the
flesh
,
and
make
some
very
good
broth
;
after
I
have
begin
to
eat
some
,
I
give
some
to
my
man
,
who
seem
very
glad
of
it
,
and
like
it
very
well
;
but
that
which
be
strange
to
him
,
be
,
to
see
me
eat
salt
with
it
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
sign
to
me
that
the
salt
be
not
good
to
eat
;
and
put
a
little
into
his
own
month
,
he
seem
to
nauseate
it
,
and
would
spit
and
sputter
at
it
,
wash
his
mouth
with
fresh
water
after
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
I
take
some
meat
in
my
mouth
without
salt
,
and
I
pretend
to
spit
and
sputter
for
want
of
salt
,
as
fast
as
he
have
do
at
the
salt
;
but
it
would
not
do
,
he
would
never
care
for
salt
with
meat
,
or
in
his
broth
;
at
least
,
not
a
great
while
,
and
then
but
a
very
little
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
feed
him
with
boil
meat
and
broth
,
I
be
resolve
to
feast
him
the
next
day
with
roast
a
piece
of
the
kid
:
<EOS>
this
I
do
by
hang
it
before
the
fire
in
a
string
,
as
I
have
see
many
people
do
in
England
,
set
two
pole
up
,
one
on
each
side
the
fire
,
and
one
cross
on
the
top
,
and
tie
the
string
to
the
cross
stick
,
let
the
meat
turn
continually
:
this
Friday
admire
very
much
;
but
when
he
come
to
taste
the
flesh
,
he
take
so
many
way
to
tell
me
how
well
he
like
it
,
that
I
could
not
but
understand
him
;
and
at
last
he
tell
me
he
would
never
eat
man
's
flesh
any
more
,
which
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
set
him
to
work
to
beat
some
corn
out
,
and
sift
it
in
the
manner
I
use
to
do
,
as
I
observe
before
;
and
he
soon
understand
how
to
do
it
as
well
as
I
,
especially
after
he
have
see
what
the
meaning
of
it
be
,
and
that
it
be
to
make
bread
of
;
for
after
that
I
let
him
see
me
make
my
bread
,
and
bake
it
too
;
and
in
a
little
time
Friday
be
able
to
do
all
the
work
for
me
,
as
well
as
I
could
do
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
consider
,
that
,
have
two
mouth
to
feed
instead
of
one
,
I
must
provide
more
ground
for
my
harvest
,
and
plant
a
large
quantity
of
corn
,
than
I
use
to
do
;
so
I
mark
out
a
large
piece
of
land
,
and
begin
the
fence
in
the
same
manner
as
before
,
in
which
Friday
not
only
work
very
willingly
and
very
hard
,
but
do
it
very
cheerfully
;
and
I
tell
him
what
it
be
for
,
that
it
be
for
corn
to
make
more
bread
,
because
he
be
now
with
me
,
and
that
I
may
have
enough
for
him
and
myself
too
:
he
appear
very
sensible
of
that
part
,
and
let
me
know
,
that
he
think
I
have
much
more
labour
upon
me
on
his
account
,
than
I
have
for
myself
,
and
that
he
would
work
the
hard
for
me
,
if
I
would
tell
him
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
pleasantest
year
of
all
the
life
I
lead
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
Friday
begin
to
talk
pretty
well
,
and
understand
the
name
of
almost
every
thing
I
have
occasion
to
call
for
,
and
of
every
place
I
have
to
send
him
to
,
and
talk
a
great
deal
to
me
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
I
begin
now
to
have
some
use
for
my
tongue
again
,
which
indeed
I
have
very
little
occasion
for
before
;
that
be
to
say
,
about
speech
.
<EOS>
besides
the
pleasure
of
talk
to
him
,
I
have
a
singular
satisfaction
in
the
fellow
himself
;
his
simple
unfeigned
honesty
appear
to
me
more
and
more
every
day
,
and
I
begin
really
to
love
the
creature
;
and
on
his
side
,
I
believe
,
he
love
me
more
than
it
be
possible
for
him
ever
to
love
any
thing
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
once
to
try
if
he
have
any
hanker
inclination
to
his
own
country
again
;
and
have
learn
him
English
so
well
,
that
he
could
answer
me
almost
any
question
<EOS>
,
I
ask
him
,
whether
the
nation
that
he
belong
to
never
conquer
in
battle
?
<EOS>
at
which
he
smile
,
and
say
,
"
yes
,
yes
,
we
always
fight
the
well
;
"
that
is
,
he
mean
,
always
get
the
well
in
fight
;
and
so
we
begin
the
follow
discourse
.
<EOS>
"
You
always
fight
the
well
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
:
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
to
be
take
prisoner
then
,
Friday
?
"
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
My
nation
beat
much
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
Master
.
<EOS>
how
beat
?
<EOS>
if
your
nation
beat
them
,
how
come
you
to
be
take
?
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
They
more
than
my
nation
in
the
place
where
me
be
;
they
take
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
me
:
<EOS>
my
nation
over
-
beat
them
in
the
yonder
place
,
where
me
no
be
;
there
my
nation
take
one
two
great
thousand
.
  
<EOS>
Master
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
not
your
side
recover
you
from
the
hand
of
your
enemy
then
?
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
They
run
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
me
,
and
make
go
in
the
canoe
;
my
nation
have
no
canoe
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
Master
.
<EOS>
well
,
Friday
,
and
what
do
your
nation
do
with
the
man
they
take
?
<EOS>
do
they
carry
them
away
,
and
eat
them
as
these
do
?
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
nation
eat
man
too
,
eat
all
up
.
  
<EOS>
Master
.
<EOS>
where
do
they
carry
them
?
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
go
to
other
place
where
they
think
.
  
<EOS>
Master
.
<EOS>
do
they
come
hither
?
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
they
come
hither
;
come
other
else
place
.
  
<EOS>
Master
.
<EOS>
have
you
be
here
with
them
?
  
<EOS>
Friday
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
here
<EOS>
[
point
to
the
N.W.
side
of
the
island
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
their
side
.
]
  
<EOS>
by
this
I
understand
,
that
my
man
Friday
have
formerly
be
among
the
savage
,
who
use
to
come
on
shore
on
the
farth
part
of
the
island
,
on
the
say
man
eat
occasion
that
he
be
now
bring
for
;
and
some
time
after
,
when
I
take
the
courage
to
carry
him
to
that
side
,
be
the
same
I
formerly
mention
,
he
presently
know
the
place
,
and
tell
me
,
he
be
there
once
when
they
eat
up
twenty
man
,
two
woman
,
and
one
child
:
<EOS>
he
could
not
tell
twenty
in
English
,
but
he
number
them
by
lay
so
many
stone
in
a
row
,
and
point
to
me
to
tell
them
over
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
tell
this
passage
,
because
it
introduce
what
follow
;
that
after
I
have
have
this
discourse
with
him
,
I
ask
him
,
how
far
it
be
from
our
island
to
the
shore
,
and
whether
the
canoe
be
not
often
lose
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
there
be
no
danger
,
no
canoe
ever
lose
;
but
that
after
a
little
way
out
to
sea
,
there
be
a
current
,
and
a
wind
always
one
way
in
the
morning
,
the
other
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
understand
to
be
no
more
than
the
set
of
the
tide
,
as
go
out
,
or
come
in
;
but
I
afterwards
understand
it
be
occasion
by
the
great
draught
and
reflux
of
the
mighty
river
Oroonoque
;
in
the
mouth
of
which
river
,
as
I
think
afterwards
,
our
island
lie
;
and
that
this
land
,
which
I
perceive
to
the
W.
and
N.W.
be
the
great
island
Trinidad
,
on
the
north
point
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
ask
Friday
a
thousand
question
about
the
country
,
the
inhabitant
,
the
sea
,
the
coast
,
and
what
nation
be
near
:
he
tell
me
all
he
know
with
the
great
openness
imaginable
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
the
name
of
the
several
nation
of
his
sort
of
people
,
but
could
get
no
other
name
than
Caribs
;
from
whence
I
easily
understand
,
that
these
be
the
Caribees
,
which
our
map
place
on
that
part
of
America
which
reach
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
Oroonoque
to
Guinea
,
and
onwards
to
St.
Martha
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
up
a
great
way
beyond
the
moon
,
that
be
,
beyond
the
setting
of
the
moon
,
which
must
be
W.
from
their
country
,
there
dwelt
white
-
bearded
man
,
like
me
,
and
point
to
my
great
whisker
,
which
I
mention
before
;
and
that
they
have
kill
much
man
,
that
be
his
word
:
by
which
I
understand
he
mean
the
Spaniards
,
whose
cruelty
in
America
have
be
spread
over
the
whole
country
,
and
be
remember
by
all
the
nation
from
father
to
son
.
  
<EOS>
I
inquire
if
he
could
tell
me
how
I
may
come
from
this
island
,
and
get
among
those
white
man
;
he
tell
me
,
yes
,
yes
,
I
may
go
in
two
canoe
;
I
could
not
understand
what
he
mean
by
two
canoe
;
till
at
last
,
with
great
difficulty
,
I
find
he
mean
,
that
it
must
be
in
a
large
great
boat
as
big
as
two
canoe
.
  
<EOS>
this
part
of
Friday
's
discourse
begin
to
relish
with
me
very
well
;
and
from
this
time
I
entertain
some
hope
,
that
one
time
or
other
I
may
find
an
opportunity
to
make
my
escape
from
this
place
,
and
that
this
poor
savage
may
be
a
means
to
help
me
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
long
time
that
Friday
have
now
be
with
me
,
and
that
he
begin
to
speak
to
me
,
and
understand
me
,
I
be
not
want
to
lay
a
foundation
of
religious
knowledge
in
his
mind
;
particularly
I
ask
him
one
time
,
who
make
him
?
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
do
not
understand
me
at
all
,
but
think
I
have
ask
who
be
his
father
:
but
I
take
it
by
another
handle
,
and
ask
him
,
who
make
the
sea
,
the
ground
he
walk
on
,
and
the
hill
and
wood
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
it
be
one
old
Benamuckee
that
live
beyond
all
:
he
could
describe
nothing
of
this
great
person
,
but
that
he
be
very
old
;
much
old
,
he
say
,
than
the
sea
or
the
land
,
than
the
moon
or
the
star
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
then
,
if
this
old
person
have
make
all
thing
,
why
do
not
all
thing
worship
him
?
<EOS>
He
look
very
grave
,
and
with
a
perfect
look
of
innocence
say
,
all
thing
say
o
!
<EOS>
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
if
the
people
who
die
in
his
country
,
go
away
any
where
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
yes
,
they
all
go
to
Benamuckee
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
him
,
whether
those
they
eat
up
,
go
thither
too
?
<EOS>
he
say
,
yes
.
  
<EOS>
from
these
thing
I
begin
to
instruct
him
in
the
knowledge
of
the
true
God
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
that
the
great
maker
of
all
thing
live
there
,
point
up
towards
heaven
;
that
he
govern
the
world
by
the
same
power
and
providence
by
which
he
make
it
;
that
he
be
omnipotent
,
could
do
every
thing
for
us
,
give
every
thing
to
us
,
take
every
thing
from
us
:
and
thus
,
by
degree
,
I
open
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
listen
with
great
attention
,
and
receive
with
pleasure
the
notion
of
Jesus
Christ
be
send
to
redeem
us
,
and
of
the
manner
of
make
our
prayer
to
God
,
and
his
be
able
to
hear
us
,
even
into
heaven
:
he
tell
me
one
day
,
that
if
our
God
could
hear
us
up
beyond
the
sun
,
he
must
needs
be
a
great
God
than
their
Benamuckee
,
who
live
but
a
little
way
off
,
and
yet
could
not
hear
,
till
they
go
up
to
the
great
mountain
,
where
he
dwell
,
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
if
ever
he
go
thither
to
speak
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
,
they
never
go
that
be
young
man
;
none
go
thither
but
the
old
man
;
whom
he
call
their
Oowookakee
,
that
is
,
as
I
make
him
explain
it
to
me
,
their
religious
,
or
clergy
;
and
that
they
go
to
say
o
!
<EOS>
(
so
he
call
say
prayer
,
)
and
then
come
back
,
and
tell
them
what
Benamuckee
say
.
<EOS>
by
this
I
observe
,
that
there
be
priestcraft
even
amongst
the
most
blinded
ignorant
Pagans
in
the
world
;
and
the
policy
of
make
a
secret
religion
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
veneration
of
the
people
to
the
clergy
,
be
not
only
to
be
find
in
the
Roman
,
but
perhaps
among
all
religious
in
the
world
,
even
among
the
most
brutish
and
barbarous
savage
.
  
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
clear
up
this
fraud
to
my
man
Friday
;
and
tell
him
,
that
the
pretence
of
their
old
man
go
up
to
the
mountain
to
say
o
!
<EOS>
to
their
god
Benamuckee
,
be
a
cheat
;
and
their
bring
word
from
thence
<EOS>
what
he
say
,
be
much
more
so
;
that
if
they
meet
with
any
answer
,
or
speak
with
any
one
there
,
it
must
be
with
an
evil
spirit
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
enter
into
a
long
discourse
with
him
about
the
devil
,
the
original
of
him
,
his
rebellion
against
God
,
his
enmity
to
man
,
the
reason
of
it
,
his
set
himself
up
in
the
dark
part
of
the
world
to
be
worship
instead
of
God
,
and
as
God
,
and
the
many
stratagem
he
make
use
of
,
to
delude
mankind
to
their
ruin
;
how
he
have
a
secret
access
to
our
passion
and
to
our
affection
,
to
adapt
his
snare
so
to
our
inclination
,
as
to
cause
us
even
to
be
our
own
tempter
,
and
to
run
upon
our
own
destruction
by
our
own
choice
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
it
be
not
so
easy
to
imprint
right
notion
in
his
mind
about
the
devil
,
as
it
be
about
the
being
of
a
God
<EOS>
:
nature
assist
all
my
argument
to
evidence
to
him
even
the
necessity
of
a
great
First
Cause
,
and
over
-
rule
govern
Power
,
a
secret
direct
Providence
,
and
of
the
equity
and
justice
of
pay
homage
to
Him
that
make
us
,
and
the
like
:
<EOS>
but
there
appear
nothing
of
all
this
in
the
notion
of
an
evil
spirit
,
of
his
original
,
his
being
,
his
nature
,
and
,
above
all
,
of
his
inclination
to
do
evil
,
and
to
draw
us
in
to
do
so
too
:
and
the
poor
creature
puzzle
me
once
in
such
a
manner
,
by
a
question
merely
natural
and
innocent
,
that
I
scarce
know
what
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
talk
a
great
deal
to
him
of
the
power
of
God
,
his
omnipotence
,
his
dreadful
aversion
to
sin
,
his
be
a
consume
fire
to
the
worker
of
iniquity
;
how
,
as
he
have
make
as
all
,
he
could
destroy
us
,
and
all
the
world
,
in
a
moment
;
and
he
listen
with
great
seriousness
to
me
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
have
be
tell
;
him
how
the
devil
be
God
's
enemy
in
the
heart
of
man
,
and
use
all
his
malice
and
skill
to
defeat
the
good
design
of
Providence
,
and
to
ruin
the
kingdom
of
Christ
in
the
world
,
and
the
like
:
"
well
,
"
say
Friday
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
say
God
be
so
strong
<EOS>
,
so
great
,
be
he
not
much
strong
,
much
might
,
as
the
devil
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
I
,
Friday
,
"
God
be
strong
than
the
devil
,
God
be
above
the
devil
,
and
therefore
we
pray
to
God
to
tread
him
under
our
foot
,
and
enable
us
to
resist
his
temptation
,
and
quench
his
fiery
dart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
he
again
,
"
if
God
much
strong
,
much
might
,
as
the
devil
,
why
God
not
kill
the
devil
,
so
make
him
no
more
wicked
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
strangely
surprised
at
his
question
;
and
after
all
,
though
I
be
now
an
old
man
,
yet
I
be
but
a
young
doctor
,
and
ill
enough
qualify
for
a
casuist
,
or
a
solver
of
difficulty
:
and
,
at
first
,
I
could
not
tell
what
to
say
;
so
I
pretend
not
to
hear
him
,
and
ask
him
what
he
say
;
but
he
be
too
earnest
for
an
answer
to
forget
his
question
;
so
that
he
repeat
it
in
the
very
same
broken
word
,
as
above
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
have
recover
myself
a
little
,
and
I
say
,
"
God
will
at
last
punish
him
severely
;
he
be
reserve
for
the
judgment
,
and
be
to
be
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
,
to
dwell
with
everlasting
fire
.
<EOS>
"
this
do
not
satisfy
Friday
;
but
he
return
upon
me
,
repeat
my
word
,
"
reserve
at
last
!
<EOS>
me
no
understand
:
<EOS>
but
why
not
kill
the
devil
now
,
not
kill
great
ago
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well
ask
me
,
"
say
I
,
"
why
God
do
not
kill
you
and
me
,
when
we
do
wicked
thing
here
that
offend
him
:
we
be
preserve
to
repent
and
be
pardon
.
"
<EOS>
He
muse
awhile
at
this
;
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
,
mighty
affectionately
,
"
that
well
;
<EOS>
so
you
<EOS>
I
,
devil
,
all
wicked
,
<EOS>
all
preserve
,
repent
,
God
pardon
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
I
be
run
down
again
by
him
to
the
last
degree
,
and
it
be
a
testimony
to
me
,
how
the
mere
notion
of
nature
,
though
they
will
guide
reasonable
creature
to
the
knowledge
of
a
God
,
and
of
a
worship
or
homage
due
to
the
supreme
being
of
God
,
as
the
consequence
of
our
nature
;
yet
nothing
but
divine
revelation
can
form
the
knowledge
of
Jesus
Christ
,
and
of
a
redemption
purchase
for
us
;
of
a
Mediator
;
of
a
new
covenant
;
and
of
an
Intercessor
at
the
footstool
of
God
's
throne
;
I
say
,
nothing
but
a
revelation
from
Heaven
can
form
these
in
the
soul
;
and
that
therefore
the
Gospel
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
<EOS>
,
I
mean
the
word
of
God
,
and
the
Spirit
of
God
,
promise
for
the
guide
and
sanctifi
of
his
people
,
be
the
absolutely
necessary
instructor
of
the
soul
of
man
in
the
save
knowledge
of
God
,
and
the
mean
of
salvation
.
  
<EOS>
I
therefore
divert
the
present
discourse
between
me
and
my
man
,
rise
up
hastily
,
as
upon
some
sudden
occasion
of
go
out
;
then
send
him
for
some
thing
a
great
way
off
,
I
seriously
pray
to
God
,
that
he
would
enable
me
to
instruct
savingly
this
poor
savage
,
assist
,
by
his
Spirit
,
the
heart
of
the
poor
ignorant
creature
to
receive
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
God
in
Christ
,
reconcile
him
to
himself
,
and
would
guide
me
to
speak
so
to
him
from
the
word
of
God
,
as
his
conscience
may
be
convince
,
his
eye
open
,
and
his
soul
save
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
again
to
me
,
I
enter
into
a
long
discourse
with
him
upon
the
subject
of
the
redemption
of
man
by
the
Saviour
of
the
world
,
and
of
the
doctrine
of
the
Gospel
preach
from
Heaven
,
viz
.
<EOS>
of
the
repentance
towards
God
,
and
faith
in
our
blessed
Lord
Jesus
:
I
then
explain
to
him
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
why
our
blessed
Redeemer
take
not
on
him
the
nature
of
angel
,
but
the
seed
of
Abraham
,
and
how
,
for
that
reason
,
the
fall
angel
have
no
share
in
the
redemption
;
that
he
come
only
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
God
know
,
more
sincerity
than
knowledge
,
in
all
the
method
I
take
for
this
poor
creature
's
instruction
;
and
must
acknowledge
,
what
I
believe
all
that
act
upon
the
same
principle
will
find
,
that
in
lay
thing
open
to
him
,
I
really
inform
and
instruct
myself
in
many
thing
that
either
I
do
not
know
,
or
have
not
fully
consider
before
;
but
which
occur
naturally
to
my
mind
,
upon
my
search
into
them
for
the
information
of
this
poor
savage
;
and
I
have
more
affection
in
my
inquiry
after
thing
upon
this
occasion
,
than
ever
I
feel
before
;
so
that
whether
this
poor
wild
wretch
be
the
well
for
me
or
no
<EOS>
,
I
have
great
reason
to
be
thankful
that
ever
he
come
to
me
:
my
grief
sit
light
upon
me
,
my
habitation
grow
comfortable
to
me
beyond
measure
;
and
when
I
reflect
,
that
in
this
solitary
life
,
which
I
have
be
confine
to
,
I
have
not
only
be
move
myself
to
look
up
to
Heaven
,
and
to
seek
to
the
Hand
that
bring
me
thither
,
but
be
now
to
be
make
an
instrument
,
under
Providence
,
to
save
the
life
,
and
for
aught
I
know
the
soul
,
of
a
poor
savage
,
and
bring
him
to
the
true
knowledge
of
religion
,
and
of
the
christian
doctrine
,
that
he
may
know
Christ
Jesus
,
to
know
whom
be
life
eternal
;
I
say
,
when
I
reflect
upon
all
these
thing
,
a
secret
joy
run
through
every
part
of
my
soul
,
and
I
frequently
rejoice
that
ever
I
be
bring
to
this
place
,
which
I
have
often
think
the
most
dreadful
of
all
affliction
that
could
possibly
have
befall
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
thankful
frame
I
continue
all
the
remainder
of
my
time
;
and
the
conversation
which
employ
the
hour
between
Friday
and
me
be
such
,
as
make
the
three
year
which
we
live
there
together
perfectly
and
completely
happy
,
if
any
such
thing
as
complete
happiness
can
be
find
in
a
sublunary
state
.
<EOS>
the
savage
be
now
a
good
Christian
,
a
much
well
than
I
;
though
I
have
reason
to
hope
,
and
bless
God
for
it
,
that
we
be
equally
penitent
,
and
comfort
restored
penitent
:
we
have
here
the
Word
of
God
to
read
,
and
no
farther
off
from
his
Spirit
to
instruct
than
if
we
have
be
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
I
always
apply
myself
to
read
the
scripture
,
and
to
let
him
know
as
well
as
I
could
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
what
I
read
;
and
he
again
,
by
his
serious
inquiry
and
question
,
make
me
,
as
I
say
before
,
a
much
well
scholar
in
the
scripture
knowledge
,
than
I
should
ever
have
be
by
my
own
private
reading
.
<EOS>
another
thing
I
can
not
refrain
from
observe
here
,
also
from
experience
,
in
this
retire
part
of
my
life
;
viz
.
<EOS>
how
infinite
and
inexpressible
a
blessing
it
be
,
that
the
knowledge
of
God
,
and
of
the
doctrine
of
salvation
by
Christ
Jesus
,
be
so
plainly
lay
down
in
the
Word
of
God
,
so
easy
to
be
receive
and
understand
,
that
as
the
bare
read
the
scripture
make
me
capable
of
understand
enough
of
my
duty
to
carry
me
directly
on
to
the
great
work
of
sincere
repentance
for
my
sin
,
and
lay
hold
of
a
Saviour
for
life
and
salvation
,
to
a
stated
reformation
in
practice
,
and
obedience
to
all
God
's
command
,
and
this
without
any
teacher
or
instructor
(
I
mean
,
human
;
)
so
the
plain
instruction
sufficiently
serve
to
the
enlighten
this
savage
creature
,
and
bring
him
to
be
such
a
Christian
,
as
I
have
know
few
equal
to
him
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
dispute
,
wrangling
,
strife
,
and
contention
,
which
have
happen
in
the
world
about
religion
,
whether
nicety
in
doctrine
,
or
scheme
of
church
-
government
,
they
be
all
perfectly
useless
to
us
,
as
,
for
aught
I
can
yet
see
,
they
have
be
to
all
the
rest
in
the
world
:
we
have
the
sure
guide
to
heaven
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
Word
of
God
;
and
we
have
,
bless
be
God
!
<EOS>
comfortable
view
of
the
Spirit
of
God
,
teaching
and
instruct
us
by
his
Word
,
lead
us
into
all
truth
,
and
make
us
both
willing
and
obedient
to
His
instruction
of
his
Word
;
and
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
the
least
use
that
the
great
knowledge
of
the
dispute
point
in
religion
,
which
have
make
such
confusion
in
the
world
,
would
have
be
to
us
,
if
we
could
have
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
on
with
the
historical
part
of
thing
,
and
take
every
part
in
its
order
.
  
<EOS>
after
Friday
and
I
become
more
intimately
acquaint
,
and
that
he
could
understand
almost
all
I
say
to
him
,
and
speak
fluently
,
though
in
broken
English
,
to
me
,
I
acquaint
him
with
my
own
story
,
or
at
least
so
much
of
it
as
relate
to
my
coming
into
the
place
,
how
I
have
live
there
,
and
how
long
:
I
let
him
into
the
mystery
<EOS>
(
for
such
it
be
to
him
)
of
gunpowder
and
bullet
,
and
teach
him
how
to
shoot
:
I
give
him
a
knife
,
which
he
be
wonderfully
delighted
with
;
and
I
make
him
a
belt
with
a
frog
hang
to
it
,
such
as
in
England
<EOS>
we
wear
hanger
in
;
and
in
the
frog
,
instead
of
a
hanger
,
I
give
him
a
hatchet
,
which
be
not
only
as
good
<EOS>
a
weapon
in
some
case
,
but
much
more
useful
upon
many
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
describe
to
him
the
country
of
Europe
,
and
particularly
England
,
which
I
come
from
;
how
we
live
,
how
we
worship
God
,
how
we
behave
to
one
another
,
and
how
we
trade
in
ship
to
all
the
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
an
account
of
the
wreck
which
I
have
be
on
board
of
,
and
shew
him
as
near
as
I
could
,
the
place
where
she
lie
;
but
she
be
all
beat
in
piece
long
before
,
and
quite
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
shew
him
the
ruin
of
our
boat
,
which
we
lose
when
we
escape
,
and
which
I
could
not
stir
with
my
whole
strength
then
,
but
be
now
fall
almost
all
to
piece
.
<EOS>
upon
see
this
boat
,
Friday
stand
muse
a
great
while
,
and
say
nothing
;
I
ask
him
what
it
be
he
study
upon
?
<EOS>
at
last
,
say
he
,
"
Me
see
such
boat
like
come
to
place
at
my
nation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
him
a
good
while
;
but
at
last
,
when
I
have
examine
further
into
it
,
I
understand
by
him
,
that
a
boat
,
such
as
that
have
be
,
come
on
shore
upon
the
country
where
he
live
;
that
is
,
as
he
explain
it
,
be
drive
thither
by
stress
of
weather
.
<EOS>
I
presently
imagine
,
that
some
european
ship
must
have
be
cast
away
upon
their
coast
,
and
the
boat
may
get
loose
,
and
drive
ashore
;
but
be
so
dull
,
that
I
never
once
think
of
man
make
escape
from
a
wreck
thither
,
<EOS>
much
less
whence
they
may
come
<EOS>
;
so
I
only
inquire
after
a
description
of
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
describe
the
boat
to
me
well
enough
;
but
bring
me
better
to
understand
him
,
when
he
add
,
with
some
warmth
,
"
We
save
the
white
man
from
drown
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
presently
ask
him
,
if
there
,
be
white
mans
,
as
he
call
them
,
in
the
boat
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
boat
full
of
while
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
,
how
many
!
<EOS>
he
tell
upon
his
finger
seventeen
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
then
,
what
become
of
them
?
<EOS>
he
tell
me
,
"
They
live
,
they
dwell
at
my
nation
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
put
new
thought
into
my
head
again
;
for
I
presently
imagine
,
that
these
may
be
the
man
belong
to
the
ship
that
be
cast
away
in
sight
of
my
island
,
as
I
now
call
it
;
and
who
,
after
the
ship
be
strike
on
the
rock
,
and
they
see
her
inevitably
lose
,
have
save
themselves
in
their
boat
,
and
be
land
upon
that
wild
shore
among
the
savage
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
I
inquire
of
him
more
critically
,
what
be
become
of
them
?
<EOS>
He
assure
me
they
live
still
there
,
that
they
have
be
there
about
four
year
,
that
the
savage
let
them
alone
,
and
give
them
victual
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
how
it
come
to
pass
they
do
not
kill
them
,
and
eat
them
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
no
,
they
make
brother
with
them
:
"
that
is
,
as
I
understand
him
,
a
truce
:
and
then
he
add
,
"
They
eat
no
man
but
when
make
the
war
fight
:
"
that
be
to
say
,
they
never
eat
any
man
,
but
such
as
come
to
fight
with
them
,
and
be
take
in
battle
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
after
this
,
some
considerable
time
,
that
be
on
the
top
of
the
hill
,
at
the
east
side
of
the
island
,
from
whence
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
have
in
a
clear
day
discover
the
main
or
continent
of
America
;
Friday
,
the
weather
be
very
serene
,
look
very
earnestly
towards
the
main
land
,
and
in
a
kind
of
surprise
fall
a
-
jump
and
dancing
,
and
call
out
to
me
,
for
I
be
at
some
distance
from
him
:
I
ask
him
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
o
joy
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
o
glad
!
<EOS>
there
see
my
country
,
there
my
nation
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
observe
an
extraordinary
sense
of
pleasure
appear
in
his
face
,
and
his
eye
sparkle
,
and
his
countenance
discover
a
strange
eagerness
,
as
if
he
have
a
mind
to
be
in
his
own
country
again
;
and
this
observation
of
mine
put
a
great
many
thought
into
me
;
which
make
me
at
first
not
so
easy
about
my
new
man
Friday
as
I
be
before
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
if
Friday
could
get
back
to
his
own
nation
again
,
he
would
not
only
forget
all
his
religion
,
but
all
his
obligation
to
me
;
and
would
be
forward
enough
to
give
his
countryman
an
account
of
me
,
and
come
back
,
perhaps
,
with
an
hundred
or
two
of
them
,
and
make
a
feast
upon
me
,
at
which
he
may
be
as
merry
as
he
use
to
be
with
those
of
his
enemy
,
when
they
be
take
in
war
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
wrong
the
poor
honest
creature
very
much
,
for
which
I
be
very
sorry
afterwards
:
however
,
as
my
jealousy
increase
,
and
hold
me
some
week
<EOS>
,
I
be
a
little
more
circumspect
,
and
not
so
familiar
and
kind
to
him
as
before
;
in
which
I
be
certainly
in
the
wrong
too
,
the
honest
grateful
creature
have
no
thought
about
it
,
but
what
consist
of
the
good
principle
,
both
as
a
religious
Christian
and
as
a
grateful
friend
,
as
appear
afterwards
to
my
full
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
my
jealousy
of
him
last
,
you
may
be
sure
I
be
every
day
pump
him
,
to
see
if
he
would
discover
any
of
the
new
thought
which
I
suspect
be
in
him
;
but
I
find
every
thing
he
say
be
so
honest
and
so
innocent
,
that
I
could
find
nothing
to
nourish
my
suspicion
;
and
,
in
spite
of
all
my
uneasiness
,
he
make
me
at
last
entirely
his
own
again
;
nor
do
he
in
the
least
perceive
that
I
be
uneasy
;
and
therefore
I
could
not
suspect
him
of
deceit
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
walk
up
the
same
hill
,
but
the
weather
be
hazy
at
sea
,
so
that
we
could
not
see
the
continent
,
I
call
to
him
,
and
say
,
"
Friday
,
do
not
you
wish
yourself
in
your
own
country
,
your
own
nation
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
be
much
o
glad
to
be
at
my
own
nation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
do
there
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
:
"
would
you
turn
wild
again
,
eat
man
's
flesh
again
,
and
be
a
savage
as
you
be
before
?
"
<EOS>
He
look
full
of
concern
,
and
shake
his
head
,
say
,
"
no
,
no
,
Friday
tell
them
to
live
good
;
tell
them
to
pray
God
;
tell
them
to
eat
corn
-
bread
,
cattle
-
flesh
,
milk
,
no
eat
man
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
they
will
kill
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
grave
at
that
,
and
then
say
,
"
no
,
they
no
kill
me
,
they
willing
love
learn
:
"
he
mean
by
this
,
they
would
be
willing
to
learn
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
they
learn
much
of
the
bearded
man
that
come
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
him
,
if
he
would
go
back
to
them
?
<EOS>
He
smile
at
that
,
and
tell
me
he
could
not
swim
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
make
a
canoe
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
would
go
,
if
I
would
so
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
why
,
they
will
eat
me
if
I
come
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
me
make
them
no
eat
you
<EOS>
,
me
make
they
much
love
you
:
"
he
mean
he
would
tell
them
how
I
have
kill
his
enemy
and
save
his
life
,
and
so
he
would
make
them
love
me
.
<EOS>
then
he
tell
me
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
how
kind
they
be
to
seventeen
white
man
,
or
bearded
man
,
as
he
call
them
,
who
come
on
shore
in
distress
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
time
,
I
confess
,
I
have
a
mind
to
venture
over
,
and
see
if
I
could
possibly
join
with
these
bearded
man
,
who
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
be
Spaniards
or
Portuguese
;
not
doubt
but
,
if
I
could
,
we
may
find
some
method
to
escape
from
thence
,
be
upon
the
continent
,
and
a
good
company
together
,
well
than
I
could
from
an
island
forty
mile
off
the
shore
,
and
alone
without
help
.
<EOS>
so
,
after
some
day
,
I
take
Friday
to
work
again
,
by
way
of
discourse
;
and
tell
him
,
I
would
give
him
a
boat
to
go
back
to
his
own
nation
;
and
accordingly
I
carry
him
to
my
frigate
,
which
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
;
and
have
clear
it
of
water
(
for
I
always
keep
it
sink
in
the
water
)
,
I
bring
it
out
,
shew
it
him
,
and
we
both
go
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
he
be
a
most
dexterous
fellow
at
manage
it
,
would
make
it
go
almost
as
swift
and
fast
again
as
I
could
;
so
when
he
be
in
,
I
say
to
him
,
"
well
,
now
,
Friday
,
shall
we
go
to
your
nation
?
"
<EOS>
He
look
very
dull
at
my
saying
so
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
because
he
think
the
boat
too
small
to
go
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
then
I
have
a
big
;
so
the
next
day
I
go
to
the
place
where
the
first
boat
lie
which
I
have
make
,
but
which
I
could
not
get
into
the
water
;
he
say
that
be
big
enough
;
but
then
,
as
I
have
take
no
care
of
it
,
and
it
have
lain
two
or
three
and
twenty
year
there
,
the
sun
have
split
and
dry
it
,
that
it
be
in
a
manner
rotten
.
<EOS>
Friday
tell
me
,
such
a
boat
would
do
very
well
,
and
would
carry
"
much
enough
vittle
,
drink
,
<EOS>
bread
:
"
that
be
his
way
of
talk
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
be
by
this
time
so
fix
upon
my
design
of
go
over
with
him
to
the
continent
,
that
I
tell
him
we
would
go
and
make
one
as
big
as
that
,
and
he
should
go
home
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
answer
not
one
word
,
but
look
very
,
grave
and
sad
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
what
be
the
matter
with
him
?
<EOS>
He
ask
me
again
thus
,
"
why
you
angry
mad
with
Friday
?
<EOS>
what
me
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
,
what
he
mean
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
not
angry
with
him
at
all
:
"
no
angry
!
<EOS>
no
angry
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
repeat
the
word
several
time
<EOS>
,
"
why
send
Friday
home
away
to
my
nation
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
Friday
,
do
you
not
say
you
wish
you
be
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
wish
be
both
there
;
no
wish
Friday
there
,
no
master
there
.
"
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
would
not
think
of
go
there
without
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
there
,
Friday
!
"
say
I
;
"
what
should
I
do
there
?
"
<EOS>
He
turn
very
quick
upon
me
at
this
;
"
You
do
great
deal
much
good
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
teach
wild
man
be
good
,
sober
,
tame
man
;
you
tell
them
know
God
,
pray
God
,
and
live
new
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
"
thou
knowest
<EOS>
not
what
thou
sayest
;
I
be
but
an
ignorant
man
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
teechee
me
good
,
you
teechee
them
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
you
shall
go
without
me
;
leave
me
here
to
live
by
myself
,
as
I
do
before
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
confused
again
at
that
word
,
and
run
to
one
of
the
hatchet
which
he
use
to
wear
,
he
take
it
up
hastily
,
and
give
it
me
.
<EOS>
"
what
must
I
do
with
this
?
"
say
I
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
take
kill
Friday
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
what
must
I
kill
you
for
?
"
say
I
again
<EOS>
,
He
return
very
quick
,
"
what
you
send
Friday
away
for
?
<EOS>
take
kill
Friday
,
no
send
Friday
away
.
<EOS>
"
this
he
speak
so
earnestly
,
that
I
see
tear
stand
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
so
plainly
discover
the
utmost
affection
in
him
to
me
,
and
a
firm
resolution
in
him
,
that
I
tell
him
then
,
and
often
after
,
that
I
would
never
send
him
away
from
me
,
if
he
be
willing
to
stay
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
as
I
find
by
all
his
discourse
a
settle
affection
to
me
,
and
that
nothing
should
part
him
from
me
,
so
I
find
all
the
foundation
of
his
desire
to
go
to
his
own
country
be
lay
in
his
ardent
affection
to
the
people
,
and
his
hope
of
my
do
them
good
;
a
thing
,
which
as
I
have
no
notion
of
myself
,
so
I
have
not
the
least
thought
,
or
intention
,
or
desire
of
undertake
it
.
<EOS>
but
still
I
find
a
strong
inclination
to
my
attempt
an
escape
,
as
above
,
found
on
the
supposition
gather
from
the
former
discourse
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
seventeen
bearded
man
there
;
and
therefore
,
without
any
delay
,
I
go
to
work
with
Friday
,
to
find
out
a
great
tree
proper
to
fell
,
and
make
a
large
periagua
or
canoe
,
to
under
take
the
voyage
<EOS>
:
there
be
tree
enough
in
the
island
to
have
build
a
little
fleet
,
not
of
periaguas
and
canoe
only
,
but
even
of
good
large
vessel
:
but
the
main
thing
I
look
at
,
be
to
get
one
so
near
the
water
,
that
we
may
launch
it
when
it
be
make
,
to
avoid
the
mistake
I
commit
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Friday
pitch
upon
a
tree
;
for
I
find
he
know
much
better
than
I
what
kind
of
wood
be
fit
for
it
;
nor
can
I
tell
to
this
day
what
wood
to
call
the
tree
we
cut
down
,
except
that
it
be
very
like
the
tree
we
call
tustick
,
or
between
that
and
the
Nicaragua
wood
,
for
it
be
much
of
the
same
colour
and
smell
.
<EOS>
Friday
be
for
burn
the
hollow
or
cavity
of
this
tree
out
,
to
make
it
into
a
boat
:
but
I
shew
him
how
rather
to
cut
it
out
with
tool
,
which
after
I
shew
him
how
to
use
,
he
do
very
handily
;
and
in
about
a
month
's
hard
labour
we
finish
it
,
and
make
it
very
handsome
,
especially
,
when
,
with
our
axis
,
which
I
shew
him
how
to
handle
,
we
cut
and
hew
the
outside
into
the
true
shape
of
a
boat
;
after
this
,
however
,
it
cost
us
near
a
fortnight
's
time
to
get
her
along
,
as
it
be
inch
by
inch
,
upon
great
roller
,
into
the
water
:
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
in
,
she
would
have
carry
twenty
man
with
great
ease
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
be
in
the
water
,
and
though
she
be
so
big
,
it
amaze
me
to
see
with
what
dexterity
and
how
swift
my
man
Friday
could
manage
her
,
turn
her
,
and
paddle
her
along
;
so
I
ask
him
if
he
would
,
and
if
we
may
venture
over
in
her
?
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
he
venture
over
in
her
very
well
,
though
great
blow
wind
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
a
farth
design
that
he
know
nothing
of
,
and
that
be
,
to
make
a
mast
and
sail
,
and
to
fit
her
with
an
anchor
and
cable
.
<EOS>
as
to
a
mast
,
that
be
easy
enough
to
get
;
so
I
pitch
upon
a
straight
young
cedar
-
tree
,
which
I
find
near
the
place
,
and
which
there
be
a
great
plenty
of
in
the
island
;
and
I
set
Friday
to
work
to
cut
it
down
,
and
give
him
direction
how
to
shape
and
order
it
:
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
sail
,
that
be
my
particular
care
;
I
know
I
have
old
sail
,
or
rather
piece
of
old
sail
enough
;
but
as
I
have
have
them
now
twenty
-
six
year
by
me
,
and
have
not
be
very
careful
to
preserve
them
,
not
imagine
that
I
should
ever
have
this
kind
of
use
for
them
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
they
be
all
rotten
;
and
indeed
most
of
them
be
so
;
however
,
I
find
two
piece
which
appear
pretty
good
,
and
with
these
I
go
to
work
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
pain
,
and
awkward
tedious
stitching
(
you
may
be
sure
)
for
want
of
needle
<EOS>
,
I
at
length
make
a
three
-
cornered
ugly
thing
,
like
what
we
call
in
England
a
shoulder
-
of
-
mutton
sail
,
to
go
with
a
boom
at
bottom
,
and
a
little
short
sprit
at
the
top
,
such
as
usually
our
ship
'
long
-
boat
sail
with
,
and
such
as
I
best
know
how
to
manage
;
because
it
be
such
a
one
as
I
use
in
the
boat
in
which
I
make
my
escape
from
Barbary
,
as
relate
in
the
first
part
of
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
near
two
month
perform
this
last
work
,
viz
.
<EOS>
rig
and
fit
my
mast
and
sail
;
for
I
finish
them
very
complete
,
make
a
small
stay
,
and
a
sail
or
foresail
to
it
,
to
assist
,
if
we
should
turn
to
windward
;
and
,
which
be
more
than
all
,
I
fix
a
rudder
to
the
stern
of
her
,
to
steer
with
;
and
though
I
be
but
a
bungling
shipwright
,
yet
as
I
know
the
usefulness
,
and
even
necessity
of
such
a
thing
,
I
apply
myself
with
so
much
pain
to
do
it
,
that
at
last
I
bring
it
to
pass
,
though
,
consider
the
many
dull
contrivance
I
have
for
it
that
fail
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
cost
me
almost
as
much
labour
as
make
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
this
be
do
,
I
have
my
man
Friday
to
teach
as
to
what
belong
to
the
navigation
of
my
boat
;
for
though
he
know
very
well
how
to
paddle
the
canoe
,
he
know
nothing
what
belong
to
a
sail
and
a
rudder
,
and
be
the
more
amazed
when
he
see
me
work
the
boat
to
and
again
in
the
sea
by
the
rudder
,
and
how
the
sail
gibe
,
and
fill
this
way
or
that
way
,
as
the
course
we
sail
change
;
I
say
,
when
he
see
this
,
he
stand
like
one
astonished
and
amazed
:
however
,
with
a
little
use
<EOS>
,
I
make
all
these
thing
familiar
to
him
,
and
he
become
an
expert
sailor
,
except
that
as
to
the
compass
I
could
make
him
understand
very
little
of
that
:
on
the
other
hand
,
as
there
be
very
little
cloudy
weather
,
and
seldom
or
never
any
fog
in
those
part
,
there
be
the
less
occasion
for
a
compass
,
see
the
star
be
always
to
be
see
by
night
,
and
the
shore
by
day
,
except
in
the
rainy
season
;
and
then
nobody
care
to
stir
abroad
,
either
by
land
or
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
enter
on
the
seven
-
and
-
twentieth
year
of
my
captivity
in
this
place
;
though
the
three
last
year
that
I
have
this
creature
with
me
,
ought
rather
to
be
leave
out
of
the
account
,
my
habitation
be
quite
of
another
kind
than
in
all
the
rest
of
my
time
.
<EOS>
I
keep
the
anniversary
of
my
landing
here
with
the
same
thankfulness
to
God
for
his
mercy
as
at
first
;
and
if
I
have
such
cause
of
acknowledgment
at
first
,
I
have
much
more
so
now
,
have
such
additional
testimony
of
the
care
of
Providence
over
me
,
and
the
great
hope
I
have
of
be
effectually
and
speedily
deliver
;
for
I
have
an
invincible
impression
upon
my
thought
,
that
my
deliverance
be
at
hand
,
and
that
I
should
not
be
another
year
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
on
with
my
husbandry
,
digging
,
plant
,
and
fence
,
as
usual
;
I
gather
and
cure
my
grape
,
and
do
every
necessary
thing
,
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
rainy
season
be
in
the
mean
time
upon
me
,
when
I
keep
more
within
door
than
at
other
time
;
so
I
have
stow
our
now
vessel
as
secure
as
we
could
,
bring
her
up
into
the
creek
,
where
,
as
I
say
in
the
beginning
,
I
land
my
raft
from
the
ship
;
and
hale
her
up
to
the
shore
,
at
high
water
mark
,
I
make
my
man
Friday
dig
a
little
dock
,
just
big
enough
for
her
to
float
in
;
and
then
,
when
the
tide
be
out
,
we
make
a
strong
dam
cross
the
end
of
it
,
to
keep
the
water
out
;
and
<EOS>
so
she
lie
dry
,
as
to
the
tide
,
from
the
sea
;
and
to
keep
the
rain
off
,
we
lay
a
great
many
bough
of
tree
so
thick
,
that
she
be
as
well
thatch
as
a
house
;
and
thus
we
wait
for
the
month
of
November
and
December
,
in
which
I
design
to
make
my
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
settle
season
begin
to
come
in
,
as
the
thought
of
my
design
return
with
the
fair
weather
,
I
be
prepare
daily
for
the
voyage
;
and
the
first
thing
I
do
be
to
lay
up
a
certain
quantity
of
provision
,
be
the
store
for
the
voyage
;
and
intend
,
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
's
time
,
to
open
the
dock
,
and
launch
out
our
boat
.
<EOS>
I
be
busy
one
morning
upon
something
of
this
kind
,
when
I
call
to
Friday
,
and
bid
him
go
to
the
sea
-
shore
,
and
see
if
he
could
find
a
turtle
or
tortoise
,
a
thing
which
we
generally
get
once
a
week
,
for
the
sake
of
the
egg
,
as
well
as
the
flesh
.
<EOS>
Friday
have
not
be
long
go
,
when
he
come
run
back
,
and
fly
over
my
outward
wall
,
or
fence
,
like
one
that
feel
not
the
ground
,
or
the
step
he
set
his
foot
on
;
and
before
I
have
time
to
speak
to
him
,
he
cry
out
to
me
,
"
o
master
!
<EOS>
o
master
!
<EOS>
o
sorrow
!
<EOS>
o
bad
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
Friday
?
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
o
yonder
there
,
"
say
he
,
"
one
,
two
,
three
,
canoe
!
<EOS>
one
,
two
,
three
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
this
way
of
speak
<EOS>
I
conclude
there
be
six
;
but
on
inquiry
I
find
there
be
but
three
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
not
be
fright
;
"
so
I
hearten
him
up
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
see
the
poor
fellow
most
terribly
scared
;
for
nothing
run
in
his
head
,
but
that
they
be
come
to
look
for
him
,
and
would
cut
him
in
piece
,
and
eat
him
;
the
poor
fellow
tremble
so
,
that
I
scarce
know
what
to
do
with
him
;
I
comfort
him
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
tell
him
I
be
in
as
much
danger
as
he
,
and
that
they
would
eat
me
as
well
as
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
Friday
,
we
must
resolve
to
fight
them
:
can
you
fight
,
Friday
?
"
<EOS>
"
Me
shoot
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
there
come
many
great
number
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
matter
for
that
,
"
say
I
again
;
"
our
gun
will
fright
them
that
we
do
not
kill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
ask
him
,
whether
,
if
I
resolve
to
defend
him
,
he
would
defend
me
,
and
stand
by
me
,
and
do
just
as
I
bade
him
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
Me
die
,
when
you
bid
die
,
master
;
"
so
I
go
and
fetch
a
good
dram
of
rum
,
and
give
him
;
for
I
have
be
so
good
a
husband
of
my
rum
,
that
I
have
a
great
deal
leave
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
drink
it
,
I
make
him
take
the
two
fowl
-
piece
which
we
always
carry
,
and
load
them
with
large
swan
-
shoot
as
big
as
small
pistol
bullet
;
then
I
take
four
musket
,
and
load
them
with
two
slug
and
five
small
bullet
each
;
and
my
two
pistol
I
load
with
a
brace
of
bullet
<EOS>
each
:
I
hang
my
great
sword
,
as
usual
,
naked
by
my
side
,
and
give
Friday
his
hatchet
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
thus
prepare
myself
,
I
take
my
perspective
-
glass
,
and
go
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
to
see
what
I
could
discover
;
and
I
find
quickly
,
by
my
glass
,
that
there
be
one
and
twenty
savage
,
three
prisoner
,
and
three
canoe
;
and
that
their
whole
business
seem
to
be
the
triumphant
banquet
upon
these
three
human
body
;
a
barbarous
feast
indeed
,
but
nothing
more
than
as
I
have
observe
be
usual
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
also
,
that
they
be
land
,
not
where
they
have
do
when
Friday
make
his
escape
,
but
near
to
my
creek
,
where
the
shore
be
low
,
and
where
a
thick
wood
come
close
almost
down
to
the
sea
:
<EOS>
this
,
with
the
abhorrence
of
the
inhuman
errand
these
wretch
come
about
,
so
fill
me
with
indignation
,
that
I
come
down
again
to
Friday
,
and
tell
him
,
I
be
resolve
to
go
down
to
them
,
and
kill
them
all
;
and
ask
him
if
he
would
stand
by
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
get
over
his
fright
,
and
his
spirit
be
a
little
raise
with
the
dram
I
have
give
him
,
he
be
very
cheerful
;
and
tell
me
,
as
before
,
he
would
die
when
I
bid
die
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
fit
of
fury
,
I
take
first
and
divide
the
arm
which
I
have
charge
,
as
before
,
between
us
:
I
give
Friday
one
pistol
to
stick
in
his
girdle
,
and
three
gun
upon
his
shoulder
;
and
I
take
one
pistol
,
and
the
other
three
,
myself
;
and
in
this
posture
we
march
out
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
small
bottle
of
rum
in
my
pocket
,
and
give
Friday
a
large
bag
with
more
powder
and
bullet
;
and
as
to
order
,
I
charge
him
to
keep
close
behind
me
,
and
not
to
stir
,
shoot
,
or
do
any
thing
till
I
bid
him
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
not
to
speak
a
word
.
<EOS>
in
this
posture
I
fetch
a
compass
to
my
right
hand
of
near
a
mile
,
as
well
to
get
over
the
creek
as
to
get
into
the
wood
;
so
that
I
may
come
within
shot
of
them
before
I
could
be
discover
,
which
I
have
see
by
my
glass
it
be
easy
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
make
this
march
,
my
former
thought
return
,
I
begin
to
abate
my
resolution
;
I
do
not
mean
,
that
I
entertain
any
fear
of
their
number
;
for
as
they
be
naked
,
unarmed
wretch
,
it
be
certain
I
be
superior
to
them
;
<EOS>
nay
,
though
I
have
be
alone
:
<EOS>
but
it
occur
to
my
thought
,
<EOS>
what
call
,
what
occasion
,
much
less
<EOS>
what
necessity
,
I
be
in
to
go
and
dip
my
hand
in
blood
,
to
attack
people
who
have
neither
do
or
intend
me
any
wrong
,
who
,
as
to
me
,
be
innocent
,
and
whose
barbarous
custom
be
their
own
disaster
,
be
in
them
a
token
indeed
of
<EOS>
God
's
have
leave
them
,
with
the
other
nation
of
that
part
of
the
world
,
to
such
stupidity
and
to
such
inhuman
course
;
but
do
not
call
me
to
take
upon
me
to
be
a
judge
of
their
action
,
much
less
an
executioner
of
his
justice
;
that
whenever
he
think
fit
,
he
would
take
the
cause
into
his
own
hand
,
and
by
national
vengeance
punish
them
for
national
crime
;
but
that
in
the
mean
time
,
it
be
none
of
my
business
;
that
it
be
true
,
Friday
may
justify
it
,
because
he
be
a
declare
enemy
,
and
in
a
state
of
war
with
those
very
particular
people
,
and
it
be
lawful
for
him
to
attack
them
;
but
I
could
not
say
the
same
with
respect
to
me
.
<EOS>
these
thing
be
so
warmly
press
upon
my
thought
all
the
way
as
I
go
,
that
I
resolve
I
would
only
go
place
myself
near
them
,
that
I
may
observe
their
barbarous
feast
,
and
that
I
would
act
then
as
God
should
direct
;
but
that
unless
something
offer
that
be
more
a
call
to
me
than
yet
<EOS>
I
know
of
,
I
would
not
meddle
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
resolution
I
enter
the
wood
,
and
with
all
possible
wariness
and
silence
(
Friday
follow
close
at
my
heel
)
<EOS>
I
march
till
I
come
to
the
skirt
of
the
wood
,
on
the
side
which
be
next
to
them
;
only
that
one
corner
of
the
wood
lie
between
me
and
them
:
here
I
call
softly
to
Friday
,
and
shew
him
a
great
tree
,
which
be
just
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
<EOS>
,
I
bid
him
go
to
the
tree
,
and
bring
me
word
if
he
could
see
there
plainly
what
they
be
do
:
he
do
so
,
and
come
immediately
back
to
me
,
and
tell
me
they
may
be
plainly
view
there
;
that
they
be
all
about
the
fire
,
eat
the
flesh
of
one
of
their
prisoner
;
and
that
another
lay
bind
upon
the
sand
,
a
little
from
them
,
whom
he
say
they
would
kill
next
,
and
which
fire
the
very
soul
within
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
it
be
not
one
of
their
nation
,
but
one
of
the
bearded
man
whom
he
have
tell
me
of
,
who
come
to
their
country
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
be
fill
with
horror
at
the
very
name
the
white
-
bearded
man
,
and
,
go
to
the
tree
<EOS>
,
I
see
plainly
,
by
my
glass
,
a
white
man
,
who
lie
upon
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
with
his
hand
and
his
foot
tie
with
flag
,
or
thing
like
rush
;
and
that
he
be
an
European
,
and
have
clothe
on
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
tree
,
and
a
little
thicket
beyond
it
,
about
fifty
yard
near
to
them
than
the
place
where
I
be
,
which
,
by
go
a
little
way
about
,
I
see
I
may
come
at
undiscovered
,
and
that
then
I
should
be
within
half
-
shot
of
them
;
so
I
withhold
my
passion
,
though
I
be
indeed
enrage
to
the
high
degree
;
and
go
back
about
twenty
pace
<EOS>
,
I
get
behind
some
bush
,
which
hold
all
the
way
till
I
come
to
the
other
tree
,
and
then
I
come
to
a
little
rising
ground
,
which
give
me
a
full
view
of
them
,
at
the
distance
of
about
eighty
yard
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
not
a
moment
to
lose
;
for
nineteen
of
the
dreadful
wretch
sit
upon
the
ground
all
close
huddle
together
,
and
have
just
send
the
other
two
to
butcher
the
poor
Christian
,
and
bring
him
,
perhaps
limb
by
limb
,
to
their
fire
;
and
they
be
stoop
down
to
untie
the
band
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
I
turn
to
Friday
;
"
now
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
as
I
bid
thee
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Friday
say
,
he
would
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
exactly
as
you
see
me
do
;
fail
in
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
set
down
one
of
the
musket
and
the
fowling
-
piece
upon
the
ground
,
and
Friday
do
the
like
by
his
;
and
with
the
other
musket
I
take
my
aim
at
the
savage
,
bid
him
do
the
like
.
<EOS>
then
ask
him
if
he
be
ready
,
he
say
,
"
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
fire
at
them
,
"
say
I
;
and
the
same
moment
I
fire
also
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
take
his
aim
so
much
well
than
I
,
that
on
the
side
that
he
shoot
,
he
kill
two
of
them
,
and
wound
three
more
;
and
on
my
side
,
I
kill
one
,
and
wound
two
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
you
may
be
sure
,
in
a
dreadful
consternation
;
and
all
of
them
,
who
be
not
hurt
,
jump
up
upon
their
foot
immediately
,
but
do
not
know
which
way
to
run
,
or
which
way
to
look
;
for
they
know
not
from
whence
their
destruction
come
.
<EOS>
Friday
keep
his
eye
close
upon
me
,
that
,
as
I
have
bid
him
,
he
may
observe
what
I
do
;
so
as
soon
as
the
first
shot
be
make
,
I
throw
down
the
piece
,
and
take
up
the
fowling
-
piece
,
and
Friday
do
the
like
;
he
see
me
cock
,
and
present
;
he
do
the
same
again
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
ready
,
Friday
?
<EOS>
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
fly
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
in
the
name
of
God
;
"
and
with
that
I
fire
again
among
the
amazed
wretch
,
and
so
do
Friday
;
and
as
our
piece
be
now
loaden
with
what
I
call
swan
shot
,
or
small
pistol
-
bullet
,
we
find
only
two
drop
;
but
so
many
be
wound
,
that
they
run
about
yell
and
scream
like
mad
creature
,
all
bloody
,
and
miserably
wound
most
of
them
;
whereof
three
more
fall
quickly
after
,
though
not
quite
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
lay
down
the
discharge
piece
,
and
take
up
the
musket
,
which
be
yet
loaden
,
"
follow
me
,
"
say
I
;
which
he
do
,
with
a
deal
of
courage
;
upon
which
I
rush
,
out
of
the
wood
,
and
shew
myself
,
and
Friday
close
at
my
foot
:
as
soon
as
I
perceive
they
see
me
,
I
shout
as
loud
as
I
could
,
and
bade
Friday
do
so
too
;
and
run
as
fast
as
I
could
,
which
by
the
way
be
not
very
fast
,
be
load
with
arm
as
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
make
directly
towards
the
poor
victim
,
who
be
,
as
I
say
,
lie
upon
the
beach
,
or
shore
,
between
the
place
where
they
sit
and
the
sea
;
the
two
butcher
,
who
be
just
go
to
work
with
him
,
have
leave
him
,
at
the
surprise
of
our
first
fire
,
and
flee
in
a
terrible
fright
to
the
sea
-
side
,
and
have
jump
into
a
canoe
,
and
three
more
of
the
rest
make
the
same
way
<EOS>
:
I
turn
to
Friday
,
and
bade
him
step
forwards
,
and
fire
at
them
;
he
understand
me
immediately
,
and
run
about
forty
yard
to
be
near
them
,
he
shoot
at
them
,
and
I
think
he
have
kill
them
all
;
for
I
see
them
all
fall
on
an
heap
into
the
boat
;
though
I
see
two
of
them
up
again
quickly
:
however
,
he
kill
two
of
them
,
and
wound
the
third
,
so
that
he
lie
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
as
if
he
have
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
while
my
man
Friday
fire
at
them
,
I
pull
out
my
knife
,
and
cut
the
flag
that
bind
the
poor
victim
;
and
loose
his
hand
and
foot
<EOS>
I
lift
him
up
,
and
ask
him
in
the
portuguese
tongue
,
what
he
be
?
<EOS>
He
answer
in
Latin
,
Christianus
;
but
be
so
weak
and
faint
,
that
he
could
scarce
stand
,
or
speak
;
I
take
my
bottle
out
of
my
pocket
,
and
give
it
him
,
make
sign
that
he
should
drink
,
which
he
do
;
and
I
give
him
a
piece
of
bread
,
which
he
eat
;
then
I
ask
him
,
what
countryman
he
be
?
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
Espagnole
;
and
,
be
a
little
recovered
,
let
me
know
,
by
all
the
sign
he
could
possibly
make
,
how
much
he
be
in
my
debt
for
his
deliverance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Seignior
,
"
say
I
,
with
as
much
Spanish
as
I
could
make
up
,
"
we
will
talk
afterwards
,
but
we
must
fight
now
:
if
you
have
any
strength
leave
,
take
this
pistol
and
sword
,
and
lie
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
take
them
very
thankfully
,
and
no
sooner
have
he
the
arm
in
his
hand
,
but
as
if
they
have
put
new
vigour
into
him
,
he
fly
upon
his
murderer
like
a
fury
,
and
have
cut
two
of
them
in
piece
in
an
instant
;
for
the
truth
be
,
as
the
whole
be
a
surprise
to
them
,
so
the
poor
creature
be
so
much
fright
with
the
noise
of
our
piece
,
that
they
fall
down
for
mere
amazement
and
fear
,
and
have
no
more
power
to
attempt
their
own
escape
,
than
their
flesh
have
to
resist
our
shot
;
and
that
be
the
case
of
those
five
that
Friday
shoot
in
the
boat
;
for
as
three
of
them
fall
with
the
hurt
they
receive
,
so
the
other
two
fall
with
the
fright
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
my
piece
in
my
hand
still
,
without
fire
,
be
willing
to
keep
my
charge
ready
,
because
I
have
give
the
Spaniard
my
pistol
and
sword
;
so
I
call
to
Friday
,
and
bade
him
run
up
to
the
tree
from
whence
we
first
fire
,
and
fetch
the
arm
which
lie
there
,
that
have
be
discharge
,
which
he
do
with
great
swiftness
;
and
then
give
him
my
musket
,
I
sit
down
myself
to
load
all
the
rest
again
,
and
bade
them
come
to
me
when
they
want
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
load
these
piece
,
there
happen
a
fierce
engagement
between
the
Spaniard
and
one
of
the
savage
,
who
make
at
him
with
one
of
their
great
wooden
sword
,
the
same
weapon
that
be
to
have
kill
him
before
,
if
I
have
not
prevent
it
:
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
,
who
be
as
bold
and
as
brave
as
could
be
imagine
,
though
weak
,
have
fight
this
Indian
a
good
while
,
and
have
cut
him
two
great
wound
on
his
head
;
but
the
savage
,
be
a
stout
lusty
fellow
,
close
in
with
him
,
have
throw
him
down
,
(
be
faint
)
and
be
wring
my
sword
out
of
his
hand
,
when
the
Spaniard
,
though
undermost
,
wisely
quit
his
sword
,
draw
the
pistol
from
his
girdle
,
shoot
the
savage
through
the
body
,
and
kill
him
upon
the
spot
,
before
I
,
who
be
run
to
help
,
could
come
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
,
be
now
leave
at
his
liberty
,
pursue
the
fly
wretch
with
no
weapon
in
his
hand
but
his
hatchet
;
and
with
that
he
dispatch
those
three
,
who
,
as
I
say
before
,
be
wound
at
first
,
and
fall
,
and
all
the
rest
he
could
come
up
with
;
and
the
Spaniard
come
to
me
for
a
gun
<EOS>
,
I
give
him
one
of
the
fowling
-
piece
,
with
which
he
pursue
two
of
the
savage
,
and
wound
them
both
;
but
as
he
be
not
able
to
run
,
they
both
get
from
him
into
the
wood
,
where
Friday
pursue
them
,
and
kill
one
of
them
;
but
the
other
be
too
nimble
for
him
;
and
though
he
be
wound
,
yet
he
plunge
into
the
sea
,
and
swam
with
all
his
might
off
to
those
who
be
leave
in
the
canoe
;
which
three
in
the
canoe
,
with
one
wound
,
who
we
know
not
whether
he
die
or
no
,
be
all
that
escape
our
hand
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
the
account
of
the
rest
be
as
follow
:

<EOS>
those
that

hard
to

and
though
Friday
make
two
or
three
shot
at
them
,
I
do
not
find
that

hit
any
of
them

Friday
would
fain
have
have
me
take
one
of
their
canoe
,
and
pursue
them
;
and
indeed
I
be
very
anxious
about
their
escape
,
l
,
carry
the
news
home
to
their
people
,
they
should
come
back
,
perhaps
,
with
two
or
three
hundred
of
their
canoe
,
and
devour
us
by
mere
multitude
;
so
I
consent
to
pursue
them
by
sea
;
and
run
to
one
of
their
canoe
,
I
jump
in
,
and
bade
Friday
follow
me
;
but
when
I
be
in
the
canoe
,
I
be
surprised
to
find
another
poor
creature
lie
there
alive
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
<EOS>
as
the
Spaniard
be
,
for
the
slaughter
,
and
almost
dead
with
fear
,
not
know
what
the
matter
be
;
for
he
have
not
be
able
to
look
up
over
the
side
of
the
boat
,
he
be
tie
so
hard
,
neck
and
heel
,
and
have
be
tie
so
long
,
that
he
have
really
little
life
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
immediately
cut
the
twist
flag
,
or
rush
,
which
they
have
bind
him
with
,
and
would
have
help
him
up
;
but
he
could
not
stand
,
or
speak
,
but
groan
most
piteously
,
believe
,
it
seem
still
,
that
he
be
only
unbound
in
order
to
be
kill
.
  
<EOS>
when
Friday
come
to
him
,
I
bid
him
speak
to
him
,
and
tell
him
of
his
deliverance
;
and
pull
out
my
bottle
,
make
him
give
the
poor
wretch
a
dram
,
which
,
with
the
news
of
his
be
deliver
,
revive
him
,
and
he
sit
up
in
the
boat
;
but
when
Friday
come
to
hear
him
speak
,
and
look
in
his
face
,
it
would
have
move
any
one
to
tear
,
to
have
see
how
Friday
kiss
him
,
embrace
him
,
hug
him
,
cry
,
laugh
,
hallooed
,
jump
about
,
dance
,
sung
,
then
cry
again
,
wring
his
hand
,
beat
his
own
face
and
head
,
and
then
sing
and
jump
about
again
like
a
distracted
creature
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
while
before
I
could
make
him
speak
to
me
,
or
tell
me
what
be
the
matter
;
but
when
he
come
a
little
to
himself
,
he
tell
me
that
it
be
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
for
me
to
express
how
it
move
me
,
to
see
what
ecstasy
and
filial
affection
have
work
in
this
poor
savage
,
at
the
sight
of
his
father
,
and
of
his
be
deliver
from
death
;
nor
indeed
can
I
describe
half
the
extravagance
of
his
affection
after
this
;
for
he
go
into
the
boat
and
out
of
the
boat
a
great
many
time
:
when
he
go
in
to
him
,
he
would
sit
down
by
him
,
open
his
breast
,
and
hold
his
father
's
head
close
to
his
bosom
,
half
an
hour
together
,
to
nourish
it
:
then
he
take
his
arm
and
ankle
,
which
be
numb
and
stiff
with
the
binding
,
and
chafe
and
rub
them
with
his
hand
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
perceive
what
the
case
be
,
give
him
some
rum
out
of
my
bottle
to
rub
them
with
,
which
do
them
a
great
deal
of
good
.
  
<EOS>
this
action
put
an
end
to
our
pursuit
of
the
canoe
with
the
other
savage
,
who
be
now
get
almost
out
of
sight
;
and
it
be
happy
for
us
that
we
do
not
;
for
it
blow
so
hard
within
two
hour
after
,
and
before
they
could
be
get
a
quarter
of
their
way
,
and
continue
blow
so
hard
all
night
,
and
that
from
the
north
-
west
,
which
be
against
them
,
that
I
could
not
suppose
their
boat
could
live
,
or
that
they
ever
reach
to
their
own
coast
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
Friday
:
he
be
so
busy
about
his
father
,
that
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
take
him
off
for
some
time
:
<EOS>
but
after
I
think
he
could
leave
him
a
little
,
I
call
him
to
me
,
and
he
come
jump
and
laughing
,
and
please
to
the
high
extreme
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
him
,
if
he
have
give
his
father
any
bread
?
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
,
and
say
,
"
none
:
ugly
dog
eat
all
up
self
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
give
him
a
cake
of
bread
out
of
a
little
pouch
I
carry
on
purpose
;
I
also
give
him
a
dram
for
himself
,
but
he
would
not
taste
it
,
but
carry
it
to
his
father
:
I
have
in
my
pocket
also
two
or
three
bunche
of
my
raisin
,
so
I
give
him
a
handful
of
them
for
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
give
his
father
these
raisin
,
but
I
see
him
come
out
of
the
boat
,
and
run
away
as
if
he
have
be
bewitch
.
<EOS>
He
run
at
such
a
rate
(
for
he
be
the
swift
fellow
of
his
foot
that
ever
I
see
)
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
he
run
at
such
a
rate
,
that
he
be
out
of
sight
,
as
it
be
,
in
an
instant
;
and
though
I
call
and
halloo
too
after
him
,
it
be
all
one
;
away
he
go
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
see
him
come
back
again
,
though
not
so
fast
as
he
go
;
and
as
he
come
nearer
,
I
find
his
pace
be
slacker
,
because
he
have
something
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
up
to
me
,
I
find
he
have
be
quite
home
for
an
earthen
jug
,
or
pot
,
to
bring
his
father
some
fresh
water
;
and
that
he
have
get
two
more
cake
or
loaf
of
bread
.
<EOS>
the
bread
he
give
me
,
but
the
water
he
carry
to
his
father
:
however
,
as
I
be
very
thirsty
too
,
I
take
a
little
sip
of
it
:
this
water
revive
his
father
more
than
all
the
rum
or
spirit
I
have
give
him
;
for
he
be
just
faint
with
thirst
.
  
<EOS>
when
his
father
have
drink
,
I
call
him
,
to
know
if
there
be
any
water
leave
?
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
yes
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
bade
him
give
it
to
the
poor
Spaniard
,
who
be
in
as
much
want
of
it
as
his
father
;
and
I
send
one
of
the
cake
,
that
Friday
bring
,
to
the
Spaniard
too
,
who
be
indeed
very
weak
,
and
be
repose
himself
upon
a
green
place
,
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
and
whose
limb
be
also
very
stiff
,
and
very
much
swell
with
the
rude
bandage
he
have
be
tie
with
<EOS>
:
when
I
see
that
,
upon
Friday
's
come
to
him
with
the
water
,
he
sit
up
and
drank
,
and
take
the
bread
,
and
begin
to
eat
,
I
go
to
him
,
and
give
him
a
handful
of
raisin
:
he
look
up
in
my
face
with
all
the
token
of
gratitude
and
thankfulness
that
could
appear
in
any
countenance
;
but
be
so
weak
,
notwithstanding
he
have
so
exert
himself
in
the
fight
,
that
he
could
not
stand
upon
his
foot
;
he
try
to
do
it
two
or
three
time
,
but
be
really
not
able
,
his
ankle
be
so
swelled
and
so
painful
to
him
;
so
I
bade
him
sit
still
,
and
cause
Friday
to
rub
his
ankle
,
and
bathe
them
with
rum
,
as
he
have
do
his
father
's
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
the
poor
affectionate
creature
every
two
minute
,
or
perhaps
less
,
all
the
while
he
be
here
,
turn
his
head
about
,
to
see
if
his
father
be
in
the
same
place
and
posture
as
he
leave
him
sit
;
and
at
last
he
find
he
be
not
to
be
see
;
at
which
he
start
up
,
and
,
without
speak
a
word
,
fly
with
that
swiftness
to
him
,
that
one
could
scarce
perceive
his
foot
to
touch
the
ground
as
he
go
:
but
when
he
come
,
he
only
find
he
have
lay
himself
down
to
ease
his
limb
:
<EOS>
so
Friday
come
back
to
me
presently
,
and
I
then
speak
to
the
Spaniard
to
let
Friday
help
him
up
,
if
he
could
,
and
load
him
to
the
boat
,
and
then
he
should
carry
him
to
our
dwelling
,
where
I
would
take
care
of
him
:
but
Friday
,
a
lusty
young
fellow
,
take
the
Spaniard
quite
up
upon
his
back
,
and
carry
him
away
to
the
boat
,
and
set
him
down
softly
upon
the
side
or
gunnel
of
the
canoe
,
with
his
foot
in
the
inside
of
it
,
and
then
lift
them
quite
in
,
and
set
him
close
to
his
father
,
and
presently
step
out
again
,
launch
the
boat
off
,
and
paddle
it
along
the
shore
faster
than
I
could
walk
,
though
the
wind
blow
pretty
hard
too
;
so
he
bring
them
both
safe
into
our
creek
;
and
leave
them
in
the
boat
,
run
away
to
fetch
the
other
canoe
.
<EOS>
as
he
pass
me
,
I
speak
to
him
,
and
ask
him
whither
he
go
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
"
go
fetch
more
boat
;
"
so
away
he
go
,
like
the
wind
;
for
sure
never
man
or
horse
run
like
him
,
and
he
have
the
other
canoe
in
the
creek
almost
as
soon
as
I
get
to
it
by
land
;
so
he
waft
me
over
,
and
then
go
to
help
our
new
guest
out
of
the
boat
,
which
he
do
;
but
they
be
neither
of
them
able
to
walk
;
so
that
poor
Friday
know
not
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
to
remedy
this
,
I
go
to
work
in
my
thought
,
and
call
to
Friday
to
bid
them
sit
down
on
the
bank
while
he
come
to
me
,
I
soon
make
a
kind
of
hand
-
barrow
to
lay
them
on
,
and
Friday
<EOS>
and
I
carry
them
up
both
together
upon
it
between
us
;
<EOS>
but
when
we
get
them
to
the
outside
of
our
wall
or
fortification
,
we
be
at
a
bad
loss
than
before
;
for
it
be
impossible
to
get
them
over
;
and
I
be
resolve
not
to
break
it
down
:
so
I
set
to
work
again
;
and
Friday
and
I
,
in
about
two
hour
time
,
make
a
very
handsome
tent
,
cover
with
old
sail
,
and
above
that
with
bough
of
tree
,
be
in
the
space
without
our
outward
fence
,
and
between
that
and
the
grove
of
young
wood
which
I
have
plant
:
and
here
we
make
two
bed
of
such
thing
as
I
have
;
viz
.
<EOS>
of
good
rice
-
straw
,
with
blanket
lay
upon
it
to
lie
on
,
and
another
to
cover
them
on
each
bed
.
  
<EOS>
My
island
be
now
people
,
and
I
think
myself
very
rich
in
subject
;
and
it
be
a
merry
reflection
which
I
frequently
make
,
how
like
a
king
I
look
:
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
the
whole
country
be
my
own
mere
property
;
so
that
I
have
an
undoubted
right
of
dominion
:
<EOS>
2dly
,
My
people
be
perfectly
subject
:
I
be
absolute
lord
and
lawgiver
;
they
all
owe
their
life
to
me
,
and
be
ready
to
lay
down
their
life
,
if
there
have
be
occasion
for
it
,
for
me
:
it
be
remarkable
too
,
<EOS>
I
have
but
three
subject
,
and
they
be
of
three
different
religion
.
<EOS>
My
man
Friday
be
a
Protestant
,
his
father
a
Pagan
and
a
cannibal
;
and
the
Spaniard
be
a
papist
:
however
,
I
allow
liberty
of
conscience
throughout
my
dominion
:
but
this
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
secure
my
two
weak
rescue
prisoner
,
and
give
them
shelter
,
and
a
place
to
rest
them
upon
,
I
begin
to
think
of
make
some
provision
for
them
;
and
the
first
thing
I
do
,
I
order
Friday
to
take
a
yearling
goat
,
betwixt
a
kid
and
a
goat
,
out
of
my
particular
flock
,
to
be
kill
:
then
I
cut
off
the
hind
quarter
,
and
,
chop
it
into
small
piece
,
I
set
Friday
to
work
to
boil
and
stew
,
and
make
them
a
very
good
dish
,
I
assure
you
,
of
flesh
and
broth
;
have
put
some
barley
and
rice
also
into
the
broth
;
and
as
I
cook
it
without
door
,
(
for
I
make
no
fire
within
my
inner
wall
)
<EOS>
so
I
carry
it
all
into
the
new
tent
;
and
have
set
a
table
there
for
them
,
I
sit
down
and
eat
my
dinner
also
with
them
;
and
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
cheer
them
and
encourage
them
,
Friday
be
my
interpreter
,
especially
to
his
father
,
and
indeed
to
the
Spaniard
too
;
for
the
Spaniard
speak
the
language
of
the
savage
pretty
well
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
dine
,
or
rather
sup
,
I
order
Friday
to
take
one
of
the
canoe
,
and
go
and
fetch
our
musket
and
other
fire
-
arm
,
which
,
for
want
of
time
,
we
have
leave
upon
the
place
of
battle
;
and
the
next
day
I
order
him
to
go
and
bury
the
dead
body
of
the
savage
,
which
lie
open
to
the
sun
,
and
,
would
presently
be
offensive
;
and
I
also
order
him
to
bury
the
horrid
remain
of
their
barbarous
feast
,
which
I
know
be
pretty
much
,
and
which
I
could
not
think
of
do
myself
;
nay
,
I
could
not
,
bear
to
see
them
,
if
I
go
that
way
:
all
which
he
punctually
perform
,
and
deface
the
very
appearance
of
the
savage
be
there
;
so
that
when
I
go
again
,
I
could
scarce
know
where
it
be
,
otherwise
than
by
the
corner
of
the
wood
point
to
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
begin
to
enter
into
a
little
conversation
with
my
two
new
subject
;
and
first
I
set
Friday
to
inquire
of
his
father
,
what
he
think
of
the
escape
of
the
savage
in
that
canoe
?
<EOS>
and
whether
he
may
expect
a
return
of
them
with
a
power
too
great
for
us
to
resist
?
<EOS>
His
first
opinion
be
,
that
the
savage
in
the
boat
never
could
live
out
the
storm
which
blow
that
night
they
go
off
,
but
must
of
necessity
be
drown
or
drive
south
to
those
other
shore
,
where
they
be
as
sure
to
be
devour
,
as
they
be
to
be
drown
if
they
be
cast
away
;
but
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
come
safe
on
shore
,
he
say
,
he
know
not
;
but
it
be
his
opinion
,
that
they
be
so
dreadfully
fright
with
the
manner
of
be
attack
,
the
noise
,
and
the
fire
,
that
he
believe
they
would
tell
their
people
they
be
all
kill
by
thunder
and
lightning
,
and
not
by
the
hand
of
man
;
and
that
the
two
which
appear
(
viz
.
<EOS>
Friday
and
I
)
be
two
heavenly
spirit
or
fury
come
down
to
destroy
them
,
and
not
man
with
weapon
.
<EOS>
this
,
he
say
,
he
know
,
because
he
hear
them
all
cry
out
<EOS>
so
in
their
language
to
one
another
;
for
it
be
impossible
for
them
to
conceive
that
a
man
should
dart
fire
,
and
speak
thunder
,
and
kill
at
a
distance
,
without
lift
up
the
hand
,
as
be
do
now
.
<EOS>
and
this
old
savage
be
in
the
right
;
for
,
as
I
understand
since
by
other
hand
,
the
savage
of
that
part
never
attempt
to
go
over
to
the
island
afterwards
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
terrified
with
the
account
give
by
these
four
man
,
(
for
it
seem
they
do
escape
the
sea
)
that
they
believe
,
whoever
go
to
that
enchanted
island
,
would
be
destroy
with
fire
from
the
god
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
I
know
not
,
and
therefore
be
under
continual
apprehension
for
a
good
while
,
and
keep
always
upon
my
guard
,
I
and
all
my
army
;
for
as
there
be
now
four
of
us
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
venture
a
hundred
of
them
fairly
in
the
open
field
at
any
time
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
,
however
,
no
more
canoe
appear
,
the
fear
of
their
come
wear
off
,
and
I
begin
to
take
my
former
thought
of
a
voyage
to
the
main
into
consideration
,
be
likewise
assure
by
Friday
's
father
,
that
I
may
depend
upon
good
usage
from
their
nation
on
his
account
,
if
I
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
thought
be
a
little
suspend
,
when
I
have
a
serious
discourse
with
the
Spaniard
,
and
when
I
understand
,
that
there
be
sixteen
more
of
his
countryman
and
Portuguese
,
who
have
be
cast
away
,
and
make
their
escape
to
that
side
,
live
there
at
peace
indeed
with
the
savage
,
but
be
very
sore
put
to
it
for
necessary
,
and
indeed
for
life
<EOS>
:
I
ask
him
all
the
particular
of
their
voyage
;
and
find
they
be
a
spanish
ship
,
bind
from
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
to
the
Havanna
,
be
direct
to
leave
their
loading
there
,
which
be
chiefly
hide
and
silver
,
and
to
bring
back
what
european
good
they
could
meet
with
there
;
that
they
have
five
portuguese
seaman
on
board
,
whom
they
take
out
of
another
wreck
;
that
five
of
their
own
man
be
drown
when
first
the
ship
be
lose
;
and
that
these
escape
through
infinite
danger
and
hazard
,
and
arrive
almost
starve
on
the
cannibal
coast
,
where
they
expect
to
have
be
devour
every
moment
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
they
have
some
arm
with
them
,
but
they
be
perfectly
useless
,
for
that
they
have
neither
powder
nor
ball
,
the
washing
of
the
sea
have
spoil
all
their
powder
,
but
a
little
which
they
use
at
their
first
landing
to
provide
themselves
some
food
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
he
think
would
become
of
them
there
;
and
if
they
have
form
no
design
of
make
any
escape
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
they
have
many
consultation
about
it
,
but
that
have
neither
vessel
,
nor
tool
to
build
one
,
or
provision
of
any
kind
,
their
counsel
always
end
in
tear
and
despair
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
how
be
think
they
would
receive
a
proposal
from
me
,
which
may
tend
towards
an
escape
;
and
whether
,
if
they
be
all
here
,
it
may
not
be
do
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
with
freedom
,
I
fear
mostly
their
treachery
and
ill
usage
of
me
,
if
I
put
my
life
in
their
hand
;
for
that
gratitude
be
no
inherent
virtue
in
the
nature
of
man
;
nor
do
man
always
square
their
dealing
by
the
obligation
they
have
receive
,
so
much
as
they
do
by
the
advantage
they
expect
:
I
tell
him
,
it
would
be
very
hard
,
that
I
should
be
the
instrument
of
their
deliverance
,
and
that
they
should
afterwards
make
me
their
prisoner
in
New
Spain
,
where
an
Englishman
be
certain
to
be
make
a
sacrifice
,
<EOS>
what
necessity
,
or
what
accident
soever
,
bring
him
thither
;
and
that
I
have
rather
be
deliver
up
to
the
savage
,
and
be
devour
alive
,
than
fall
into
the
merciless
claws
of
the
priest
,
and
be
carry
into
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
I
add
,
that
otherwise
I
be
persuade
,
if
they
be
all
here
,
we
may
,
with
so
many
hand
,
build
a
bark
large
enough
to
carry
us
all
away
either
to
the
Brasils
southward
,
or
to
the
island
or
spanish
coast
northward
:
but
that
if
in
requital
they
should
,
when
I
have
put
weapon
into
their
hand
,
carry
me
by
force
among
their
own
people
<EOS>
,
I
may
be
ill
use
for
my
kindness
to
them
,
and
make
my
case
bad
than
it
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
,
with
a
great
deal
of
candour
and
ingenuity
,
that
their
condition
be
so
miserable
,
and
they
be
so
sensible
of
it
,
that
he
believe
they
would
abhor
the
thought
of
use
any
man
unkindly
that
should
contribute
to
their
deliverance
;
and
that
,
if
I
please
,
he
would
go
to
them
with
the
old
man
,
and
discourse
with
them
about
it
,
and
return
again
,
and
bring
me
their
answer
:
that
he
would
make
condition
with
them
upon
their
solemn
oath
,
that
they
would
be
absolutely
under
my
leading
,
as
their
commander
and
captain
;
and
that
they
should
swear
upon
the
holy
Sacraments
and
Gospel
,
to
be
true
to
me
,
and
go
to
such
christian
country
as
I
should
agree
to
,
and
no
other
;
and
to
be
direct
wholly
and
absolutely
by
my
order
,
till
they
be
land
safely
in
such
country
as
I
intend
;
and
that
he
would
bring
a
contract
from
them
under
their
hand
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
tell
me
,
he
would
first
swear
to
me
himself
,
that
he
would
never
stir
from
me
as
long
as
he
live
,
till
I
give
him
order
;
and
that
he
would
take
my
side
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
,
if
there
should
happen
the
least
breach
of
faith
among
his
countryman
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
they
be
all
of
them
very
civil
honest
man
,
and
they
be
under
the
great
distress
imaginable
,
have
neither
weapon
or
clothe
,
nor
any
food
,
but
at
the
mercy
and
discretion
of
the
savage
;
out
of
all
hope
of
ever
return
to
their
own
country
:
and
that
he
be
sure
,
if
I
would
undertake
their
relief
,
they
would
live
and
die
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
assurance
,
I
resolve
to
venture
to
relieve
them
,
if
possible
,
and
to
send
the
old
savage
and
the
Spaniard
over
to
them
to
treat
:
but
when
he
have
get
all
thing
in
readiness
to
go
,
the
Spaniard
himself
start
an
objection
,
which
have
so
much
prudence
in
it
on
one
hand
,
and
so
much
sincerity
on
the
other
hand
,
that
I
could
not
but
be
very
well
satisfied
in
it
;
and
,
by
his
advice
,
put
off
the
deliverance
of
his
comrade
for
at
least
half
a
year
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
thus
:
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
with
us
now
about
a
month
;
during
which
time
I
have
let
him
see
in
what
manner
I
have
provide
,
with
the
assistance
of
Providence
,
for
my
support
;
and
he
see
evidently
what
stock
of
corn
and
rice
I
have
lay
up
;
which
,
as
it
be
more
,
than
sufficient
for
myself
,
so
it
be
not
sufficient
,
at
least
without
good
husbandry
,
for
my
family
,
now
it
be
increase
to
number
four
:
but
much
less
would
it
be
sufficient
,
if
his
countryman
,
who
be
,
as
he
say
,
fourteen
still
alive
,
should
come
over
;
and
least
of
all
would
it
be
sufficient
to
victual
our
vessel
,
if
we
should
build
one
,
for
a
voyage
to
any
of
the
christian
colony
of
America
.
<EOS>
so
he
tell
me
,
he
think
it
would
be
more
adviseable
,
to
let
him
and
the
other
two
dig
and
cultivate
some
more
land
,
as
much
as
I
could
spare
seed
to
sow
;
and
that
we
should
wait
another
harvest
,
that
we
may
have
a
supply
of
corn
for
his
countryman
when
they
should
come
;
for
want
may
be
a
temptation
to
them
to
disagree
,
or
not
to
think
themselves
deliver
,
otherwise
than
out
of
one
difficulty
into
another
:
"
You
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
child
of
Israel
,
though
they
rejoice
at
first
at
their
being
deliver
out
of
Egypt
,
yet
rebel
even
against
God
himself
,
that
deliver
them
,
when
they
come
to
want
bread
in
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
caution
be
so
seasonable
,
and
his
advice
so
good
,
that
I
could
not
but
be
very
well
pleased
with
his
proposal
,
as
well
as
I
be
satisfied
with
his
fidelity
.
<EOS>
so
we
fall
to
digging
,
all
four
of
us
,
as
well
as
the
wooden
tool
we
be
furnish
with
permit
;
and
in
about
a
month
's
time
,
by
the
end
of
which
it
be
seed
time
,
we
have
get
as
much
land
cure
and
trim
up
as
we
sow
twenty
-
two
bushel
of
barley
on
,
and
sixteen
jar
of
rice
,
which
be
,
in
short
,
all
the
seed
we
have
to
spare
;
nor
indeed
do
we
leave
ourselves
barley
sufficient
for
our
own
food
for
the
six
month
that
we
have
to
expect
our
crop
,
that
be
to
say
,
reckon
from
the
time
we
set
our
seed
aside
for
sow
;
for
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
it
be
six
month
in
the
ground
in
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
society
enough
,
and
our
number
be
sufficient
to
put
us
out
of
fear
of
the
savage
,
if
they
have
come
,
unless
their
number
have
be
very
great
,
we
go
freely
all
over
the
island
,
wherever
we
find
occasion
;
and
as
here
we
have
our
escape
or
deliverance
upon
our
thought
,
it
be
impossible
,
at
least
for
me
,
to
have
the
mean
of
it
out
of
mine
;
to
this
purpose
,
I
mark
out
several
tree
,
which
I
think
fit
for
our
work
,
and
I
set
Friday
and
his
father
to
cut
them
down
;
and
then
I
cause
the
Spaniard
,
to
whom
I
impart
my
thought
on
that
affair
,
to
oversee
and
direct
their
work
:
I
show
them
with
what
indefatigable
pain
<EOS>
I
have
hew
a
large
tree
into
single
plank
,
and
I
cause
them
to
do
the
like
,
till
they
have
about
a
dozen
large
plank
of
good
oak
,
near
two
foot
broad
,
thirty
-
five
foot
long
,
and
from
two
inch
to
four
inch
thick
:
what
prodigious
labour
it
take
up
,
any
one
may
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
contrive
to
increase
my
little
flock
of
tame
goat
as
much
as
I
could
;
and
to
this
purpose
I
make
Friday
and
the
Spaniard
to
go
out
one
day
,
and
myself
with
Friday
,
the
next
day
,
for
we
take
our
turn
:
and
by
this
mean
we
get
about
twenty
young
kid
to
breed
up
with
the
rest
;
for
whenever
we
shoot
the
dam
,
we
save
the
kid
,
and
add
them
to
our
flock
:
but
above
all
,
the
season
for
cure
the
grape
come
on
,
I
cause
such
a
prodigious
quantity
to
be
hang
up
in
the
sun
,
that
I
believe
,
have
we
be
at
Alicant
,
where
the
raisin
of
the
sun
be
cure
,
we
should
have
fill
sixty
or
eighty
barrel
;
and
these
,
with
our
bread
,
be
a
great
part
of
our
food
,
and
very
good
live
too
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
for
it
be
an
exceed
nourish
food
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
harvest
,
and
our
crop
in
good
order
;
it
be
not
the
most
plentiful
increase
I
have
see
in
the
island
,
but
,
however
,
it
be
enough
to
answer
our
end
;
for
from
twenty
two
bushel
of
barley
,
we
bring
in
and
thresh
out
above
two
hundred
and
twenty
bushel
,
and
the
like
in
proportion
of
the
rice
,
which
be
store
enough
for
our
food
to
the
next
harvest
,
though
all
the
sixteen
Spaniards
have
be
on
shore
with
me
;
or
,
if
we
have
be
ready
for
a
voyage
,
it
would
very
plentifully
have
victual
our
ship
,
to
have
carry
us
to
any
part
of
the
world
,
that
be
to
say
,
of
America
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
thus
house
and
secure
our
magazine
of
corn
,
we
fall
to
work
to
make
more
wicker
-
work
;
viz
.
,
<EOS>
great
basket
,
in
which
we
keep
it
;
and
the
Spaniard
be
very
handy
and
dexterous
at
this
part
,
and
often
blame
me
,
that
I
do
not
make
some
thing
for
defence
of
this
kind
of
work
;
but
I
see
no
need
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
have
a
full
supply
of
food
for
all
the
guest
expect
,
I
give
the
Spaniard
leave
to
go
over
to
the
main
,
to
see
what
he
could
do
with
those
he
leave
behind
him
there
:
I
give
him
a
strict
charge
in
write
not
to
bring
any
man
with
him
,
who
would
not
first
swear
,
in
the
presence
of
himself
and
of
the
old
savage
,
that
he
would
no
way
injure
,
fight
with
,
or
attack
the
person
he
should
find
in
the
island
,
who
be
so
kind
to
send
for
them
in
order
to
their
deliverance
;
but
that
they
would
stand
by
and
defend
him
against
all
such
attempt
;
and
wherever
they
go
,
would
be
entirely
under
,
and
subject
to
his
command
;
and
that
this
should
be
put
in
writing
,
and
sign
with
their
hand
:
how
we
be
to
have
this
do
,
when
I
know
they
have
neither
pen
or
ink
,
that
indeed
be
a
question
which
we
never
ask
.
  
<EOS>
under
these
instruction
,
the
Spaniard
,
and
the
old
savage
,
(
the
father
of
Friday
)
go
away
in
one
of
the
canoe
,
which
they
may
be
say
to
come
in
,
or
rather
be
bring
in
,
when
they
come
as
prisoner
to
be
devour
by
the
savage
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
each
of
them
a
musket
with
a
firelock
on
it
,
and
about
eight
charge
of
powder
and
ball
,
charge
them
to
be
very
good
husband
of
both
,
and
not
to
use
either
of
them
but
upon
urgent
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
cheerful
work
,
be
the
first
measure
use
by
me
in
view
of
my
deliverance
for
now
twenty
-
seven
year
and
some
day
.
<EOS>
I
give
them
provision
of
bread
,
and
of
dry
grape
,
sufficient
for
themselves
for
many
day
,
and
sufficient
for
their
countryman
for
about
eight
day
time
;
and
wish
them
a
good
voyage
,
I
let
them
go
,
agree
with
them
about
a
signal
they
should
hang
out
at
their
return
,
by
which
I
should
know
them
again
,
when
they
come
back
,
at
a
distance
,
before
they
come
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
They
go
away
with
a
fair
gale
on
the
day
that
the
moon
be
at
the
full
;
by
my
account
in
the
month
of
October
;
but
as
for
the
exact
reckoning
of
day
,
after
I
have
once
lose
it
,
I
could
never
recover
it
again
;
nor
have
I
keep
even
the
number
of
year
so
punctually
,
as
to
be
sure
that
I
be
right
,
though
,
as
it
prove
when
I
afterwards
examine
my
account
<EOS>
,
I
find
I
have
keep
a
true
reckoning
of
year
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
less
than
eight
day
<EOS>
I
wait
for
them
,
when
a
strange
and
unforeseen
accident
intervene
,
of
which
the
like
have
not
,
perhaps
,
be
hear
of
in
history
.
<EOS>
I
be
fast
asleep
in
my
hutch
one
morning
,
when
my
man
Friday
come
run
in
to
me
,
and
call
aloud
,
"
Master
,
master
,
they
be
come
,
they
be
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
jump
up
,
and
,
regardless
of
danger
,
I
go
out
as
soon
as
I
could
get
my
clothe
on
,
through
my
little
grove
,
which
(
by
the
way
)
be
by
this
time
grow
to
be
a
very
thick
wood
;
I
say
,
regardless
of
danger
,
I
go
without
my
arm
,
which
be
not
my
custom
to
do
;
but
I
be
surprised
,
when
,
turn
my
eye
to
the
sea
,
I
presently
see
a
boat
at
about
a
league
and
a
half
's
distance
,
stand
in
for
the
shore
,
with
a
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
the
wind
blow
pretty
fair
to
bring
them
in
.
<EOS>
also
I
observe
presently
,
that
they
do
not
come
from
that
side
which
the
shore
lie
on
,
but
from
the
southernmost
end
of
the
island
.
<EOS>
upon
this
I
call
Friday
in
,
and
bid
him
be
close
,
for
these
be
not
the
people
we
look
for
,
and
that
we
do
not
know
yet
whether
they
be
friend
or
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
I
go
in
to
fetch
my
perspective
glass
,
to
see
what
I
could
make
of
them
;
and
have
take
the
ladder
out
,
I
climb
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
as
I
use
to
do
when
I
be
apprehensive
of
any
thing
,
and
to
take
my
view
the
plainer
without
be
discover
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
set
my
foot
on
the
hill
,
when
my
eye
plainly
discover
a
ship
lie
at
an
anchor
,
at
about
two
league
and
a
half
's
distance
from
me
,
S.S.E.
but
not
above
a
league
and
a
half
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
by
my
observation
it
appear
plainly
to
be
an
english
ship
,
and
the
boat
appear
to
be
an
english
long
-
boat
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
the
confusion
I
be
in
,
though
the
joy
of
see
a
ship
,
and
one
whom
I
have
reason
to
believe
be
man
by
my
own
countryman
,
and
consequently
friend
,
be
such
as
I
can
not
describe
;
but
yet
I
have
some
secret
doubt
hang
about
me
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
tell
from
whence
they
come
,
bid
me
keep
upon
my
guard
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
it
occur
to
me
to
consider
what
business
an
english
ship
could
have
in
that
part
of
the
world
;
since
it
be
not
the
way
to
or
from
any
part
of
the
world
where
the
English
have
any
traffic
;
and
I
know
there
have
be
no
storm
to
drive
them
in
there
,
as
in
distress
;
and
that
if
they
be
English
really
,
it
be
most
probable
that
they
be
here
upon
no
good
design
;
and
that
I
have
better
continue
as
I
be
,
than
fall
into
the
hand
of
thief
and
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
let
no
man
despise
the
secret
hint
and
notice
of
danger
,
which
sometimes
be
give
him
when
he
may
think
there
be
no
possibility
of
its
be
real
.
<EOS>
that
such
hint
and
notice
be
give
us
,
I
believe
few
that
have
make
any
observation
of
thing
can
deny
;
that
they
be
certain
discovery
of
an
invisible
world
,
and
a
converse
of
spirit
,
we
can
not
doubt
;
and
if
the
tendency
of
them
seem
to
be
to
warn
us
of
danger
,
why
should
we
not
suppose
they
be
from
some
friendly
agent
,
(
whether
supreme
,
or
inferior
and
subordinate
,
be
not
the
question
,
)
and
that
they
be
give
for
our
good
?
  
<EOS>
the
present
question
abundantly
confirm
me
in
the
justice
of
this
reasoning
;
for
have
I
not
be
make
cautious
by
this
secret
admonition
,
come
from
whence
<EOS>
it
will
,
I
have
be
undo
inevitably
,
and
in
a
far
bad
condition
than
before
,
as
you
will
see
presently
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
keep
myself
long
in
this
posture
,
but
I
see
the
boat
draw
near
the
shore
,
as
if
they
look
for
a
creek
to
thrust
in
at
for
the
convenience
of
landing
;
however
,
as
they
do
not
come
quite
far
enough
,
they
do
not
see
the
little
inlet
where
I
formerly
land
my
raft
,
but
run
their
boat
on
shore
upon
the
beach
,
at
about
half
a
mile
from
me
,
which
be
very
happy
for
me
;
for
otherwise
they
would
have
land
just
,
as
I
may
say
,
at
my
door
,
and
would
have
soon
beat
me
out
of
my
castle
,
and
,
perhaps
,
have
plunder
me
of
all
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
on
shore
,
I
be
fully
satisfied
they
be
Englishmen
,
at
least
most
of
them
;
one
or
two
I
think
be
dutch
,
but
it
do
not
prove
so
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
all
eleven
man
,
whereof
three
of
them
<EOS>
I
find
be
unarmed
,
and
(
as
I
think
)
bind
;
and
when
the
first
four
or
five
of
them
be
jump
on
shore
,
they
take
those
three
out
of
the
boat
as
prisoner
:
one
of
the
three
I
could
perceive
use
the
most
passionate
gesture
of
entreaty
,
affliction
,
and
despair
,
even
to
a
kind
of
extravagance
;
the
other
two
<EOS>
,
I
could
perceive
,
lift
up
their
hand
sometimes
,
and
appear
concerned
indeed
,
but
not
to
such
a
degree
as
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
confound
at
the
sight
,
and
know
not
what
the
meaning
of
it
should
be
;
Friday
call
out
to
me
in
English
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
"
o
master
!
<EOS>
you
see
english
man
eat
prisoner
as
well
as
savage
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
Friday
,
do
you
think
they
be
go
to
eat
them
then
<EOS>
"
 
"
yes
,
"
say
Friday
,
"
they
will
eat
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
Friday
;
I
be
afraid
they
will
murder
them
indeed
;
but
you
may
be
sure
they
will
not
eat
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
I
have
no
thought
of
what
the
matter
really
be
,
but
stand
tremble
with
the
horror
of
the
sight
,
expect
every
moment
when
the
three
prisoner
should
be
kill
;
nay
,
once
I
see
one
of
the
villain
lift
up
his
arm
with
a
great
cutlass
(
as
the
seaman
call
it
)
or
sword
,
to
strike
one
of
the
poor
man
;
and
I
expect
to
see
him
fall
every
moment
,
at
which
all
the
blood
in
my
body
seem
to
run
chill
in
my
vein
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
heartily
now
for
our
Spaniard
,
and
the
savage
that
be
go
with
him
;
or
that
I
have
any
way
to
have
come
undiscovered
within
shot
of
them
,
that
I
may
have
rescue
the
three
man
;
for
I
see
no
fire
-
arm
they
have
among
them
;
but
it
fall
out
to
my
mind
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
observe
the
outrageous
usage
of
the
three
man
by
the
insolent
seaman
,
I
observe
the
fellow
run
scatter
about
the
land
,
as
if
they
want
to
see
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
observe
also
,
that
the
three
other
man
have
liberty
to
go
where
they
please
;
but
they
sit
down
all
three
upon
the
ground
very
pensive
,
and
look
like
man
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
this
put
me
in
mind
of
the
fine
time
when
I
come
on
shore
,
and
begin
to
look
about
me
;
how
I
give
myself
over
for
lost
<EOS>
,
how
wildly
I
look
round
me
,
<EOS>
what
dreadful
apprehension
I
have
,
and
how
I
lodge
in
the
tree
all
night
for
fear
of
be
devour
by
wild
beast
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
know
nothing
that
night
of
the
supply
I
be
to
receive
by
the
providential
driving
of
the
ship
nearer
the
land
,
by
the
storm
and
tide
,
by
which
I
have
since
be
so
long
nourish
and
support
;
so
these
three
poor
desolate
man
know
nothing
how
certain
of
deliverance
and
supply
they
be
,
how
near
it
be
to
them
,
and
how
effectually
and
really
they
be
in
a
condition
of
safety
,
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
they
think
themselves
lose
,
and
their
case
desperate
.
  
<EOS>
so
little
<EOS>
do
we
see
before
us
in
the
world
,
and
so
much
reason
have
we
to
depend
cheerfully
upon
the
great
maker
of
the
world
,
that
he
do
not
leave
his
creature
so
absolutely
destitute
,
but
that
in
the
bad
circumstance
they
have
always
something
to
be
thankful
for
,
and
sometimes
be
near
their
deliverance
than
they
imagine
;
nay
,
be
even
bring
to
their
deliverance
by
the
mean
by
which
they
seem
to
be
bring
to
their
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
at
the
top
of
high
water
when
these
people
come
on
shore
,
and
while
,
partly
they
stand
parley
with
the
prisoner
they
bring
,
and
partly
while
they
ramble
about
to
see
what
kind
of
place
they
be
in
,
they
have
carelessly
staid
till
the
tide
be
spend
,
and
the
water
be
ebb
considerably
away
,
leave
their
boat
aground
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
leave
two
man
in
the
boat
,
who
,
as
I
find
afterwards
,
have
drink
a
little
too
much
brandy
,
fall
asleep
;
however
,
one
of
them
wake
sooner
than
the
other
,
and
find
the
boat
too
fast
aground
for
him
to
stir
it
,
halloo
for
the
rest
who
be
straggle
about
,
upon
which
they
all
soon
come
to
the
boat
<EOS>
but
it
be
past
all
their
strength
to
launch
her
,
the
boat
be
very
heavy
,
and
the
shore
on
that
side
be
a
soft
oozy
sand
,
almost
like
a
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
,
like
true
seaman
,
who
be
,
perhaps
,
the
least
of
all
mankind
give
to
fore
-
think
,
they
give
it
over
,
and
away
they
stroll
about
the
country
again
;
and
I
hear
one
of
them
say
aloud
to
another
,
(
call
them
off
from
the
boat
)
<EOS>
"
why
,
let
her
alone
,
Jack
,
can
not
ye
?
<EOS>
she
will
float
next
tide
.
<EOS>
"
by
which
I
be
fully
confirm
in
the
main
inquiry
,
of
what
countryman
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
I
keep
myself
close
,
not
once
daring
to
stir
out
of
my
castle
,
any
further
than
to
my
place
of
observation
,
near
the
top
of
the
hill
;
and
very
glad
I
be
,
to
think
how
well
it
be
fortify
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
no
less
then
ten
hour
before
the
boat
could
be
on
float
again
,
and
by
that
time
it
would
be
dark
and
I
may
be
more
at
liberty
to
see
their
motion
,
and
to
hear
their
discourse
,
if
they
have
any
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
I
fit
myself
up
for
a
battle
,
as
before
,
though
with
more
caution
,
know
I
have
to
do
with
another
kind
of
enemy
than
I
have
at
first
:
I
order
Friday
also
,
whom
I
have
make
an
excellent
marksman
with
his
gun
,
to
load
himself
with
arm
:
<EOS>
I
take
myself
two
fowl
-
piece
,
and
I
give
him
three
musket
.
<EOS>
My
figure
,
indeed
,
be
very
fierce
;
I
have
my
formidable
goat
-
skin
coat
on
,
with
the
great
cap
I
mention
,
a
naked
sword
,
two
pistol
in
my
belt
,
and
a
gun
upon
each
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
design
,
as
I
say
above
,
not
to
have
make
any
attempt
till
it
be
dark
;
but
about
two
o'clock
,
be
the
heat
of
the
day
<EOS>
,
I
find
that
in
short
they
be
all
go
straggle
into
the
wood
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
be
all
lay
down
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
three
poor
distressed
man
,
too
anxious
for
their
condition
to
get
any
sleep
,
be
however
set
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
great
tree
,
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
me
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
out
of
sight
of
any
of
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
I
resolve
to
discover
myself
to
them
,
and
learn
something
of
their
condition
.
<EOS>
immediately
I
march
in
the
figure
above
,
my
man
Friday
at
a
good
distance
behind
me
,
as
formidable
for
his
arm
as
I
,
but
not
make
quite
so
stare
a
spectre
-
like
figure
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
as
near
them
undiscovered
as
I
could
,
and
then
before
any
of
them
see
me
,
I
call
aloud
to
them
in
Spanish
,
what
be
ye
gentleman
?
  
<EOS>
They
start
up
at
the
noise
,
but
be
ten
time
more
confounded
when
they
see
me
,
and
the
uncouth
figure
that
I
make
.
<EOS>
They
make
no
answer
at
all
,
but
I
think
I
perceive
them
just
go
to
fly
from
me
,
when
I
speak
to
them
in
English
,
gentleman
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
do
not
be
surprize
at
me
;
perhaps
you
may
have
a
friend
near
you
when
you
do
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
send
directly
from
Heaven
then
,
say
one
of
them
very
gravely
to
me
,
and
pull
off
his
hat
at
the
same
time
to
me
,
for
our
condition
be
past
the
help
of
man
.
<EOS>
all
help
be
from
Heaven
,
sir
,
say
I.
<EOS>
but
can
you
put
a
stranger
in
the
way
how
to
help
you
,
for
you
seem
to
me
to
be
in
some
great
distress
?
<EOS>
I
see
you
when
you
land
,
and
when
you
seem
to
make
application
to
the
brute
that
come
with
you
,
I
see
one
of
them
lift
up
his
sword
to
kill
you
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
man
with
tear
run
down
his
face
,
and
tremble
,
look
like
one
astonish
,
return
,
be
I
talk
to
God
,
or
man
!
<EOS>
be
it
a
real
man
,
or
an
angel
!
<EOS>
be
in
no
fear
about
that
,
sir
,
say
I
,
if
God
have
send
an
angel
to
relieve
you
,
he
would
have
come
better
cloathe
,
and
arm
after
another
manner
than
you
see
me
in
;
pray
lie
aside
your
fear
,
I
be
a
man
,
an
Englishman
,
and
dispose
to
assist
you
,
you
see
;
I
have
one
servant
only
;
we
have
arm
and
ammunition
;
tell
us
freely
,
can
we
serve
you
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
case
?
  
<EOS>
Our
case
,
say
he
,
sir
,
be
too
long
to
tell
you
,
while
our
murtherer
be
so
near
;
but
in
short
,
sir
,
I
be
commander
of
that
ship
,
my
man
have
mutiny
against
me
;
they
have
be
hardly
prevail
on
not
to
murther
me
,
and
at
last
have
set
me
on
shore
in
this
desolate
place
,
with
these
two
man
with
me
;
one
my
mate
,
the
other
a
passenger
,
where
we
expect
to
perish
,
believe
the
place
to
be
uninhabite
,
and
know
not
yet
what
to
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
where
be
those
brute
,
your
enemy
,
say
I
,
do
you
know
where
they
be
go
?
<EOS>
there
they
lye
,
sir
,
say
he
,
point
to
a
thicket
of
tree
;
my
heart
tremble
,
for
fear
they
have
see
us
,
and
hear
you
speak
,
if
they
have
,
they
will
certainly
murther
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
have
they
any
fire
-
arm
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
he
answer
they
have
only
two
piece
,
and
one
which
they
leave
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
I
,
leave
the
rest
to
me
<EOS>
;
I
see
they
be
all
asleep
,
it
be
an
easy
thing
to
kill
them
all
;
but
shall
we
rather
take
them
prisoner
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
there
be
two
desperate
villain
among
them
,
that
it
be
scarce
safe
to
shew
any
mercy
to
;
but
if
they
be
secure
,
he
believe
all
the
rest
would
return
to
their
duty
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
which
they
be
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
could
not
at
that
distance
describe
them
;
but
he
would
obey
my
order
in
any
thing
I
would
direct
.
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
let
us
retreat
out
of
their
view
or
hearing
,
<EOS>
least
they
awake
,
and
we
will
resolve
further
;
so
they
willingly
go
back
with
me
,
till
the
wood
cover
us
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
look
you
,
sir
,
say
I
,
if
I
venture
upon
your
deliverance
,
be
you
willing
to
make
two
condition
with
me
?
<EOS>
he
anticipate
my
proposal
,
by
tell
me
,
that
both
he
and
the
ship
,
if
recover
,
should
be
wholly
direct
and
command
by
me
in
every
thing
;
and
if
the
ship
be
not
recover
,
he
would
live
and
dye
with
me
in
what
part
of
the
world
soever
<EOS>
I
would
send
him
;
and
the
two
other
man
say
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
my
condition
be
but
two
.
1
.
<EOS>
that
while
you
stay
on
this
island
with
me
,
you
will
not
pretend
to
any
authority
here
;
and
if
I
put
arm
into
your
hand
,
you
will
upon
all
occasion
give
them
up
to
me
,
and
do
no
prejudice
to
me
or
mine
,
upon
this
island
,
and
in
the
mean
time
be
govern
by
my
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
2
.
<EOS>
that
if
the
ship
be
or
may
be
recover
,
you
will
carry
me
and
my
man
to
England
,
passage
free
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
all
the
assurance
that
the
invention
and
faith
of
a
man
could
devise
,
that
he
would
comply
with
these
most
reasonable
demand
,
and
besides
would
owe
his
life
to
me
,
and
acknowledge
it
upon
all
occasion
as
long
as
he
live
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
here
be
three
musket
for
you
,
with
powder
and
ball
;
tell
me
next
what
you
think
be
proper
to
be
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
shew
all
the
testimony
of
his
gratitude
that
he
be
able
;
but
offer
to
be
wholly
guide
by
me
:
I
tell
him
,
I
think
it
be
hard
venture
any
thing
,
but
the
good
method
I
could
think
of
,
be
to
fire
upon
them
at
once
,
as
they
lay
;
and
if
any
be
not
kill
at
the
first
volley
,
and
offer
to
submit
,
we
may
save
them
,
and
so
put
it
wholly
upon
God
's
providence
to
direct
the
shot
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
very
modestly
,
that
he
be
loath
to
kill
them
,
if
he
could
help
it
;
but
that
those
two
be
incorrigible
villain
,
and
have
be
the
author
of
all
the
mutiny
in
the
ship
;
and
if
they
escape
,
we
should
be
undo
still
;
for
they
would
go
on
board
,
and
bring
the
whole
ship
's
company
,
and
destroy
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
then
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
necessity
legitimate
my
advice
;
for
it
be
the
only
way
to
save
our
life
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
see
him
still
cautious
of
shed
blood
,
I
tell
him
,
they
should
go
themselves
,
and
manage
as
they
find
convenient
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
this
discourse
we
hear
some
of
them
awake
,
and
soon
after
we
see
two
of
them
on
their
foot
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
if
either
of
them
be
the
man
who
he
have
say
be
the
head
of
the
mutiny
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
may
let
them
escape
,
and
Providence
seem
to
have
waken
them
on
purpose
to
save
themselves
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
the
rest
escape
you
,
it
be
your
fault
.
"
  
<EOS>
animate
with
this
,
he
take
the
musket
I
have
give
him
in
his
hand
,
and
pistol
in
his
belt
,
and
his
two
comrade
with
him
,
with
each
man
a
piece
in
his
hand
:
the
two
man
,
who
be
with
him
,
go
first
,
make
some
noise
,
at
which
one
of
the
seaman
,
who
be
awake
,
turn
about
,
and
see
them
come
,
cry
out
to
the
rest
;
but
it
be
too
late
then
<EOS>
;
for
the
moment
he
cry
out
,
they
fire
,
I
mean
the
two
man
,
the
captain
wisely
reserve
his
own
piece
:
they
have
so
well
aim
their
shot
at
the
man
they
know
,
that
one
of
them
be
kill
on
the
spot
,
and
the
other
very
much
wounded
;
but
not
be
dead
<EOS>
he
start
up
on
his
foot
,
and
call
eagerly
for
help
to
the
other
;
but
the
captain
,
step
to
him
,
tell
him
it
be
too
late
to
cry
for
help
;
he
should
call
upon
God
to
forgive
his
villany
;
and
with
that
word
knock
him
down
with
the
stock
of
his
musket
,
so
that
he
never
speak
more
:
there
be
three
more
in
the
company
,
and
one
of
them
be
also
slightly
wound
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
be
come
;
and
when
they
see
their
danger
,
and
that
it
be
in
vain
to
resist
,
they
beg
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
the
captain
tell
them
,
he
would
spare
their
life
,
if
they
would
give
him
any
assurance
of
their
abhorrence
of
the
treachery
they
have
be
guilty
of
,
and
would
swear
to
be
faithful
to
him
in
recover
the
ship
,
and
afterwards
in
carry
her
back
to
Jamaica
,
from
whence
they
come
.
<EOS>
They
give
him
all
the
protestation
of
their
sincerity
that
could
be
desire
,
and
he
be
willing
to
believe
them
,
and
spare
their
life
,
which
I
be
not
against
;
only
I
oblige
him
to
keep
them
bind
hand
and
foot
while
they
be
upon
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
,
I
send
Friday
with
the
captain
's
mate
to
the
boat
,
with
order
to
secure
her
,
and
bring
away
the
oar
and
sail
,
which
they
do
;
and
by
and
by
,
three
straggle
man
,
that
be
(
happily
for
them
)
part
from
the
rest
,
come
back
upon
hear
the
gun
fire
;
and
see
their
captain
,
who
before
be
their
prisoner
,
now
their
conqueror
,
they
submit
to
be
bind
also
;
and
so
our
victory
be
complete
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
remain
,
that
the
captain
and
I
should
inquire
into
one
another
's
circumstance
:
I
begin
first
,
and
tell
him
my
whole
history
,
which
he
hear
with
an
attention
even
to
amazement
,
and
particularly
at
the
wonderful
manner
of
my
be
furnish
with
provision
and
ammunition
;
and
indeed
,
as
my
story
be
a
whole
collection
of
wonder
,
it
affect
him
deeply
;
but
when
he
reflect
from
thence
upon
himself
,
and
how
I
seem
to
have
be
preserve
there
on
purpose
to
save
his
life
,
the
tear
run
down
his
face
,
and
he
could
not
speak
a
word
more
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
communication
be
at
an
end
,
I
carry
him
and
his
two
man
into
my
apartment
,
lead
them
in
just
where
I
come
out
,
viz
.
<EOS>
at
the
top
of
the
house
;
where
I
refresh
them
with
such
provision
as
I
have
,
and
shew
them
all
the
contrivance
I
have
make
during
my
long
,
long
inhabit
that
place
.
  
<EOS>
all
I
shew
them
,
all
I
say
to
them
,
be
perfectly
amazing
;
but
,
above
all
,
the
captain
admire
my
fortification
;
and
how
perfectly
I
have
conceal
my
retreat
with
a
grove
of
tree
,
which
,
have
now
be
plant
near
twenty
year
,
and
the
tree
grow
much
faster
than
in
England
,
be
become
a
little
wood
,
and
so
thick
,
that
it
be
impassable
in
any
part
of
it
,
but
at
that
one
side
where
I
have
reserve
my
little
winding
passage
into
it
:
this
I
tell
him
be
my
castle
,
and
my
residence
;
but
that
I
have
a
seat
in
the
country
,
as
most
prince
have
,
whither
I
could
retreat
upon
occasion
,
and
I
would
shew
him
that
too
another
time
;
but
at
present
our
business
be
to
consider
how
to
recover
the
ship
.
<EOS>
He
agree
with
me
as
to
that
;
but
tell
me
,
he
be
perfectly
at
a
loss
what
measure
to
take
;
for
that
there
be
still
six
-
and
-
twenty
hand
on
board
,
who
have
enter
into
a
curse
conspiracy
,
by
which
they
have
all
forfeit
their
life
to
the
law
,
would
be
harden
in
it
now
by
desperation
;
and
would
carry
it
on
,
know
that
,
if
they
be
reduce
,
they
should
be
bring
to
the
gallow
as
soon
as
they
come
to
England
,
or
to
any
of
the
english
colony
;
and
that
therefore
there
would
be
no
attack
them
with
so
small
a
number
as
we
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
muse
for
some
time
upon
what
he
have
say
,
and
find
it
be
a
very
rational
conclusion
,
and
that
therefore
something
be
to
be
resolve
on
very
speedily
,
as
well
to
draw
the
man
on
board
into
some
snare
for
their
surprise
,
as
to
prevent
their
landing
upon
us
,
and
destroy
us
.
<EOS>
upon
this
it
presently
occur
to
me
,
that
in
a
little
while
the
ship
's
crew
,
wonder
what
be
become
of
their
comrade
,
and
of
the
boat
,
would
certainly
come
on
shore
in
their
other
boat
to
see
for
them
;
and
that
then
perhaps
they
may
come
armed
,
and
be
too
strong
for
us
:
<EOS>
this
he
allow
be
rational
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
I
tell
him
,
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
be
to
stave
the
boat
,
which
lie
upon
the
beach
,
so
that
they
may
not
carry
her
off
;
and
take
every
thing
out
of
her
,
leave
her
so
far
useless
as
not
to
be
fit
to
swim
;
accordingly
we
go
on
board
,
take
the
arm
which
be
leave
on
board
out
of
her
,
and
whatever
else
we
find
there
,
which
be
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
and
another
of
rum
,
a
few
biscuit
cake
,
an
horn
of
powder
,
and
a
great
lump
of
sugar
in
a
piece
of
canvas
;
the
sugar
be
five
or
six
pound
;
all
which
be
very
welcome
to
me
,
especially
the
brandy
and
sugar
,
of
which
I
have
have
none
leave
for
many
year
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
carry
all
these
thing
on
shore
,
(
the
oar
,
mast
,
sail
,
and
rudder
of
the
boat
be
carry
before
as
above
,
)
<EOS>
we
knock
a
great
hole
in
her
bottom
,
that
if
they
have
come
strong
enough
to
master
us
,
yet
they
could
not
carry
off
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
not
much
in
my
thought
,
that
we
could
be
capable
to
recover
the
ship
;
but
my
view
be
,
that
if
they
go
away
without
the
boat
,
I
do
not
much
question
to
make
her
fit
again
to
carry
us
away
to
the
Leeward
Islands
,
and
call
upon
our
friend
the
Spaniards
in
my
way
,
for
I
have
them
still
in
my
thought
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
thus
prepare
our
design
,
and
have
first
by
main
strength
heave
the
boat
up
upon
the
beach
,
so
high
that
the
tide
would
not
float
her
off
at
high
water
mark
;
and
,
besides
,
have
break
a
hole
in
her
bottom
too
big
to
be
quickly
stop
,
and
be
sit
down
muse
what
we
should
do
;
we
hear
the
ship
fire
a
gun
,
and
see
her
make
a
waft
with
her
ancient
,
as
a
signal
for
the
boat
to
come
on
board
;
but
no
boat
stir
;
and
they
fire
several
time
,
make
other
signal
for
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
all
their
signal
and
firing
prove
fruitless
,
and
they
find
the
boat
do
not
stir
,
we
see
them
(
by
the
help
of
our
glass
)
hoist
another
boat
out
,
and
row
towards
the
shore
;
and
we
find
,
as
they
approach
,
that
there
be
no
less
than
ten
man
in
her
,
and
that
they
have
fire
-
arm
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
ship
lie
almost
two
league
from
the
shore
,
we
have
a
full
view
of
them
as
they
come
,
and
a
plain
sight
of
the
man
,
even
of
their
face
;
because
the
tide
have
set
them
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
other
boat
,
they
row
up
under
shore
,
to
come
to
the
same
place
where
the
other
have
land
,
and
where
the
boat
lie
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
means
,
I
say
,
we
have
a
full
view
of
them
,
and
the
captain
know
the
person
and
character
of
all
the
man
in
the
boat
;
of
whom
he
say
that
there
be
three
very
honest
fellow
,
who
he
be
sure
be
lead
into
this
conspiracy
by
the
rest
,
be
overpower
and
fright
:
but
that
for
the
boatswain
,
who
,
it
seem
,
be
the
chief
officer
among
them
,
and
all
the
rest
,
they
be
as
outrageous
as
any
of
the
ship
's
crew
;
and
be
,
no
doubt
,
make
desperate
in
their
new
enterprise
;
and
terribly
apprehensive
he
be
,
that
they
would
be
too
powerful
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
smile
at
him
,
and
tell
him
,
that
man
in
our
circumstance
be
past
the
operation
of
fear
:
that
see
almost
every
condition
that
could
be
be
well
than
that
we
be
suppose
to
be
in
,
we
ought
to
expect
that
the
consequence
,
whether
death
or
life
,
would
be
sure
to
be
a
deliverance
<EOS>
:
I
ask
him
,
what
he
think
of
the
circumstance
of
my
life
,
and
whether
a
deliverance
be
not
worth
venture
for
?
"
<EOS>
and
where
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
your
belief
of
my
be
preserve
here
on
purpose
to
save
your
life
,
which
elevate
you
a
little
while
ago
?
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
"
say
I
,
"
there
seem
to
be
but
one
thing
amiss
in
all
the
prospect
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
'
<EOS>
tis
<EOS>
that
as
you
say
,
there
be
three
or
four
honest
fellow
among
them
,
which
should
be
spare
;
have
they
be
all
of
the
wicked
part
of
the
crew
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
think
God
's
providence
have
single
them
out
to
deliver
them
into
your
hand
;
for
,
depend
upon
it
,
every
man
of
them
that
come
ashore
,
be
our
own
,
and
shall
die
or
live
as
they
behave
to
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
I
speak
this
with
a
raise
voice
and
cheerful
countenance
,
I
find
it
greatly
encourage
him
;
so
we
set
vigorously
to
our
business
.
<EOS>
We
have
,
upon
the
first
appearance
of
the
boat
be
come
from
the
ship
,
consider
of
separate
our
prisoner
,
and
have
indeed
secure
them
effectually
.
  
<EOS>
two
of
them
,
of
whom
the
captain
be
less
assured
than
ordinary
<EOS>
,
I
send
with
Friday
,
and
one
of
the
three
(
deliver
man
)
to
my
cave
,
where
they
be
remote
enough
,
and
out
of
danger
of
be
hear
or
discover
,
or
of
find
their
way
out
of
the
wood
,
if
they
could
have
deliver
themselves
;
here
they
leave
them
bind
,
but
give
them
provision
,
and
promise
them
,
if
they
continue
there
quietly
,
to
give
them
their
liberty
in
a
day
or
two
;
but
that
if
they
attempt
their
escape
,
they
should
be
put
to
death
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
They
promise
faithfully
to
bear
their
confinement
with
patience
,
and
be
very
thankful
that
they
have
such
good
usage
as
to
have
provision
and
a
light
leave
them
;
for
Friday
give
them
candle
(
such
as
we
make
ourselves
)
for
their
comfort
;
and
they
do
not
know
but
that
he
stand
centinel
over
them
at
the
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
prisoner
have
well
usage
;
two
of
them
be
keep
pinion
indeed
,
because
the
captain
be
not
free
to
trust
them
;
but
the
other
two
be
take
into
my
service
upon
their
captain
's
recommendation
,
and
upon
their
solemnly
engage
to
live
and
die
with
us
;
so
,
with
them
and
the
three
honest
man
,
we
be
seven
man
well
armed
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
we
should
be
able
to
deal
well
enough
with
the
ten
that
be
a
-
come
,
consider
that
the
captain
have
say
,
there
be
three
or
four
honest
man
among
them
also
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
get
to
the
place
where
their
other
boat
lie
,
they
run
their
boat
into
the
beach
,
and
come
all
on
shore
,
haul
the
boat
up
after
them
,
which
I
be
glad
to
see
;
for
I
be
afraid
they
would
rather
have
leave
the
boat
at
an
anchor
,
<EOS>
some
distance
from
the
shore
,
with
some
hand
in
her
to
guard
her
;
and
so
we
should
not
be
able
to
seize
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
be
on
shore
,
the
first
thing
they
do
,
they
run
all
to
the
other
boat
;
and
it
be
easy
to
see
they
be
under
a
great
surprise
to
find
her
strip
as
above
,
of
all
that
be
in
her
,
and
a
great
hole
in
her
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
after
they
have
muse
awhile
upon
this
,
they
set
up
two
or
three
great
shout
,
halloo
with
all
their
might
,
to
try
if
they
could
make
their
companion
hear
;
but
all
be
to
no
purpose
:
then
they
come
all
close
in
a
ring
,
and
fire
a
volley
of
their
small
arm
,
which
indeed
we
hear
,
and
the
echo
make
the
wood
ring
;
but
it
be
all
one
:
those
in
the
cave
,
we
be
sure
,
could
not
hear
;
and
those
in
our
keeping
,
though
they
hear
it
well
enough
,
yet
durst
give
no
answer
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
so
astonished
at
the
surprise
of
this
,
that
,
as
they
tell
us
afterwards
,
they
resolve
to
go
all
on
board
again
to
their
ship
,
and
let
them
know
there
,
that
the
man
be
all
murder
,
and
the
long
-
boat
stave
;
accordingly
,
they
immediately
launch
the
boat
again
,
and
get
all
of
them
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
be
terribly
amazed
,
and
even
confound
at
this
,
believe
they
would
go
on
board
the
ship
again
and
set
sail
,
give
their
comrade
up
for
lost
,
and
so
he
should
still
lose
the
ship
,
which
he
be
in
hope
we
should
have
recover
;
but
he
be
quickly
as
much
fright
the
other
way
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
long
put
off
with
the
boat
,
but
we
perceive
them
all
come
on
shore
again
;
but
with
this
new
measure
in
their
conduct
,
which
it
seem
they
consult
together
upon
;
viz
.
<EOS>
to
leave
three
man
in
the
boat
,
and
the
rest
to
go
on
shore
,
and
go
up
into
the
country
to
look
for
their
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
disappointment
to
us
;
for
now
we
be
at
a
loss
what
to
do
;
for
our
seize
those
seven
man
on
shore
would
be
no
advantage
to
us
if
we
let
the
boat
escape
,
because
they
would
then
row
away
to
the
ship
;
and
then
the
rest
of
them
would
be
sure
to
weigh
,
and
set
sail
,
and
so
our
recover
the
ship
would
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
we
have
no
remedy
but
to
wait
and
see
what
the
issue
of
thing
may
present
.
<EOS>
the
seven
man
come
on
shore
,
and
the
three
who
remain
in
the
boat
put
her
off
to
a
good
distance
from
the
shore
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
to
wait
for
them
;
so
that
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
come
at
them
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
those
that
come
on
shore
keep
close
together
,
march
towards
the
top
of
the
little
hill
,
under
which
my
habitation
lie
;
and
we
could
see
them
plainly
,
though
they
could
not
perceive
us
;
we
could
have
be
very
glad
they
would
have
come
near
to
us
,
so
that
we
may
have
fire
at
them
;
or
that
they
would
have
go
farther
off
,
that
we
may
have
come
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
they
be
come
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
where
they
could
see
a
great
way
in
the
valley
and
woods
,
which
lie
towards
the
north
-
east
part
,
and
where
the
island
lie
low
,
they
shout
and
hallooed
till
they
be
weary
;
and
not
care
,
it
seem
,
to
venture
far
from
the
shore
,
nor
far
from
one
another
,
they
sit
down
together
under
a
tree
,
to
consider
of
it
:
<EOS>
have
they
think
fit
to
have
go
to
sleep
there
,
as
the
other
party
of
them
have
do
,
they
have
do
the
job
for
us
;
but
they
be
too
full
of
apprehension
of
danger
,
to
venture
to
go
to
sleep
,
though
they
could
not
tell
what
the
danger
be
they
have
to
fear
neither
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
make
a
very
just
proposal
to
me
upon
this
consultation
of
theirs
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
perhaps
they
would
all
fire
a
volley
again
,
to
endeavour
to
make
their
fellow
hear
,
and
that
we
should
all
sally
upon
them
,
just
at
the
juncture
when
their
piece
be
all
discharge
,
and
they
would
certainly
yield
,
and
we
should
have
them
without
bloodshed
:
<EOS>
I
like
the
proposal
,
provide
it
be
do
while
we
hear
,
when
they
be
presently
stop
by
the
creek
,
where
the
water
be
up
,
they
could
not
get
over
,
and
call
for
the
boat
to
come
up
,
and
set
them
over
,
as
indeed
I
expect
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
set
themselves
over
,
I
observe
,
that
the
boat
be
go
up
a
good
way
into
the
creek
,
and
as
it
be
,
in
a
harbour
within
the
land
,
they
take
one
of
the
three
man
out
of
her
to
go
along
with
them
,
and
leave
only
two
in
the
boat
,
have
fasten
her
to
the
stump
of
a
little
tree
on
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
wish
for
,
and
immediately
leave
Friday
and
the
captain
's
mate
to
their
business
,
I
take
the
rest
with
me
,
and
cross
the
creek
out
of
their
sight
,
we
surprize
the
two
man
before
they
be
aware
;
one
of
them
lie
on
shore
,
and
the
other
be
in
the
boat
;
the
fellow
on
shore
,
be
between
sleep
and
wake
,
and
go
to
start
up
,
the
captain
who
be
foremost
,
run
in
upon
him
,
and
knock
him
down
,
and
then
call
out
to
him
in
the
boat
,
to
yield
,
or
he
be
a
dead
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
need
very
few
argument
to
persuade
a
single
man
to
yield
,
when
he
see
five
man
upon
him
,
and
his
comrade
knock
down
;
besides
,
this
be
it
seem
one
of
the
three
who
be
not
so
hearty
in
the
mutiny
as
the
rest
of
the
crew
,
and
therefore
be
easily
persuade
,
not
only
to
yield
,
but
afterwards
to
join
very
sincere
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Friday
and
the
captain
's
mate
so
well
manage
their
business
with
the
rest
,
that
they
draw
them
by
hollow
and
answer
,
from
one
hill
to
another
,
and
from
one
wood
to
another
,
till
they
not
only
heartily
tire
them
but
leave
them
,
where
they
be
very
sure
they
could
not
reach
back
to
the
boat
,
before
it
be
dark
;
and
indeed
they
be
heartily
tired
themselves
also
by
the
time
they
come
back
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
now
to
do
,
but
to
watch
for
them
,
in
the
dark
,
and
to
fall
upon
them
,
so
as
to
make
sure
work
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
several
hour
after
Friday
come
back
to
me
before
they
come
back
to
their
boat
;
and
we
could
hear
the
foremost
of
them
,
long
before
they
come
quite
up
,
call
to
those
behind
to
come
along
;
and
could
also
hear
them
answer
,
and
complain
how
lame
and
tired
they
be
,
and
not
be
able
to
come
any
faster
,
which
be
very
welcome
news
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
they
come
up
to
the
boat
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
express
their
confusion
,
when
they
find
the
boat
fast
aground
in
the
creek
,
the
tide
ebb
out
,
and
their
two
man
go
:
we
could
hear
them
call
to
one
another
in
a
most
lamentable
manner
,
tell
one
another
they
be
get
into
an
enchant
island
;
that
either
there
be
inhabitant
in
it
,
and
they
should
all
be
murder
;
or
else
there
be
devil
or
spirit
in
it
,
and
they
should
be
all
carry
away
and
devour
.
  
<EOS>
They
halloo
again
,
and
call
their
two
comrade
by
their
name
a
great
many
time
,
but
no
answer
:
after
some
time
,
we
could
see
them
,
by
the
little
light
there
be
,
run
about
wring
their
hand
,
like
man
in
despair
;
and
that
sometimes
they
would
go
and
sit
down
in
the
boat
to
rest
themselves
,
then
come
ashore
,
and
walk
about
again
,
and
so
the
same
thing
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
My
man
would
fain
have
have
me
give
them
leave
to
fall
upon
them
at
once
in
the
dark
;
but
I
be
willing
to
take
them
at
some
advantage
,
so
to
spare
them
,
and
kill
as
few
of
them
as
I
could
;
and
especially
I
be
unwilling
to
hazard
the
killing
any
of
our
man
,
know
the
other
man
be
very
well
armed
:
I
resolve
to
wait
to
see
if
they
do
not
separate
;
and
therefore
,
to
make
sure
of
them
,
I
draw
my
ambuscade
nearer
;
and
order
Friday
and
the
captain
to
creep
upon
their
hand
and
foot
as
close
to
the
ground
as
they
could
,
that
they
may
not
be
discover
,
and
get
as
near
them
as
they
could
possibly
,
before
they
offer
to
fire
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
long
in
that
posture
,
till
the
boatswain
,
who
be
the
principal
ringleader
of
the
mutiny
,
and
have
now
shew
himself
the
most
dejected
and
dispirit
of
all
the
rest
,
come
walk
towards
them
with
two
more
of
the
crew
;
the
captain
be
so
eager
,
at
have
the
principal
rogue
so
much
in
his
power
,
that
he
could
hardly
have
patience
to
let
him
come
so
near
as
to
be
sure
of
him
;
for
they
only
hear
his
tongue
before
:
but
when
they
come
nearer
,
the
captain
and
Friday
,
start
up
on
their
foot
,
let
fly
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
boatswain
be
kill
upon
the
spot
;
the
next
man
be
shoot
in
the
body
,
and
fall
just
by
him
,
though
he
do
not
die
till
an
hour
or
two
after
;
and
the
third
run
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
noise
of
the
fire
,
I
immediately
advance
with
my
whole
army
,
which
be
now
eight
man
;
viz
.
<EOS>
myself
generalissimo
;
Friday
my
lieutenant
-
general
;
the
captain
and
his
two
man
,
and
the
three
prisoner
of
war
,
whom
he
have
trust
with
arm
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
upon
them
indeed
in
the
dark
,
so
that
they
could
not
see
our
number
;
and
I
make
the
man
they
have
leave
in
the
boat
,
who
be
now
one
of
us
,
to
call
them
by
name
,
to
try
if
I
could
bring
them
to
a
parley
,
and
so
may
perhaps
reduce
them
to
term
;
which
fall
out
just
as
we
desire
:
for
indeed
it
be
easy
to
think
,
as
their
condition
then
be
,
they
would
be
very
-
willing
to
capitulate
;
so
he
call
out
,
as
loud
as
he
could
,
to
one
of
them
,
"
Tom
Smith
,
Tom
Smith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
Smith
answer
immediately
,
"
who
be
that
?
<EOS>
Robinson
?
<EOS>
"
for
it
seem
he
know
his
voice
.
<EOS>
the
other
answer
,
"
ay
,
ay
;
for
God
's
sake
,
Tom
Smith
,
throw
down
your
arm
,
and
yield
,
or
you
be
all
dead
man
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
must
we
yield
to
?
<EOS>
where
be
they
?
"
say
Smith
again
.
<EOS>
"
here
they
be
,
"
say
he
;
"
here
be
our
captain
and
fifty
man
with
him
,
have
be
hunt
you
this
two
hour
;
the
boatswain
be
kill
,
Will
Frye
be
wound
,
and
I
be
a
prisoner
;
and
if
you
do
not
yield
,
your
be
all
lose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
they
give
us
quarter
then
?
"
say
Tom
Smith
,
"
and
we
will
yield
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
and
ask
,
if
you
promise
to
yield
,
"
say
Robinson
.
<EOS>
so
he
ask
the
captain
,
and
the
captain
himself
then
call
out
,
"
You
Smith
,
you
know
my
voice
,
if
you
lay
down
your
arm
immediately
,
and
submit
,
you
shall
have
your
life
,
all
but
Will
Atkins
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
Will
Atkins
cry
out
,
"
for
God
's
sake
,
captain
,
give
me
quarter
:
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
they
have
be
all
as
bad
<EOS>
us
<EOS>
I
,
"
(
which
by
the
way
be
not
true
,
either
;
for
it
seem
this
<EOS>
Will
Atkins
be
the
first
man
that
lay
hold
of
the
captain
when
they
first
mutiny
,
and
use
him
barbarously
,
in
tie
his
hand
,
and
give
him
injurious
language
:
)
<EOS>
however
,
the
captain
tell
him
he
must
lay
down
his
arm
at
discretion
,
and
trust
to
the
governor
's
mercy
,
by
which
he
mean
me
;
for
they
all
call
me
governor
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
all
lay
down
their
arm
,
and
beg
their
life
;
and
I
send
the
man
that
have
parley
with
them
,
and
two
more
,
who
bind
them
all
;
and
then
my
great
army
of
fifty
man
,
which
,
particularly
with
those
three
,
be
all
but
eight
,
come
up
and
seize
upon
them
all
,
and
upon
their
boat
,
only
that
I
keep
myself
and
one
more
out
of
sight
,
for
reason
of
state
.
  
<EOS>
Our
next
work
be
to
repair
the
boat
,
and
to
think
of
seize
the
ship
;
and
as
for
the
captain
,
now
he
have
leisure
to
parley
with
them
,
he
expostulate
with
them
upon
the
villany
of
their
practice
with
him
,
and
at
length
,
upon
the
farther
wickedness
of
their
design
;
and
how
certainly
it
must
bring
them
to
misery
and
distress
in
the
end
,
and
perhaps
to
the
gallow
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
appear
very
penitent
,
and
beg
hard
for
their
life
:
as
for
that
,
he
tell
them
they
be
none
of
his
prisoner
,
but
the
commander
's
of
the
island
;
that
they
think
they
have
set
him
on
shore
in
a
barren
uninhabited
island
;
but
it
have
please
God
so
to
direct
them
,
that
the
island
be
inhabit
,
and
that
the
governor
be
an
Englishman
:
that
he
may
hang
them
all
there
,
if
he
please
;
but
as
he
have
give
them
all
quarter
,
he
suppose
he
would
send
them
to
England
,
to
be
deal
with
there
as
justice
require
,
except
Atkins
,
whom
he
be
command
by
the
governor
to
advise
to
prepare
for
death
;
for
that
he
would
be
hang
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
though
this
be
all
a
fiction
of
his
own
,
yet
it
have
its
desire
effect
.
<EOS>
Atkins
fall
upon
his
knee
to
beg
the
captain
to
intercede
with
the
governor
for
his
life
;
and
all
the
rest
beg
of
him
for
God
's
sake
,
that
they
may
not
be
send
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
occur
to
me
,
that
the
time
of
our
deliverance
be
come
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
most
easy
thing
to
bring
these
fellow
in
to
be
hearty
in
get
possession
of
the
ship
;
so
I
retire
in
the
dark
from
them
,
that
they
may
not
see
what
kind
of
a
governor
they
have
,
and
call
the
captain
to
me
:
when
I
call
,
as
at
a
good
distance
,
one
of
the
man
be
order
to
speak
again
,
and
say
to
the
captain
,
"
Captain
,
the
commander
call
for
you
;
"
and
presently
the
captain
reply
,
"
tell
his
excellency
I
be
just
a
-
come
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
more
perfectly
amuse
them
;
and
they
all
believe
that
the
commander
be
just
by
with
his
fifty
man
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
captain
be
come
to
me
,
I
tell
him
my
project
for
seize
the
ship
,
which
he
like
wonderfully
well
,
and
resolve
to
put
it
in
execution
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
order
to
execute
it
with
more
art
,
and
to
be
secure
of
success
,
I
tell
him
we
must
divide
the
prisoner
,
and
that
he
should
go
and
take
Atkins
,
and
two
more
of
the
bad
of
them
,
and
send
them
pinion
to
the
cave
where
the
other
lie
:
this
be
commit
to
Friday
,
and
the
two
man
who
come
on
shore
with
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
They
convey
them
to
the
cave
,
as
to
a
prison
;
and
it
be
indeed
a
dismal
place
,
especially
to
man
in
their
condition
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
I
order
to
my
bower
,
as
I
call
it
,
of
which
I
have
give
a
full
description
;
and
as
it
be
fence
in
,
and
they
pinion
,
the
place
be
secure
enough
,
consider
they
be
upon
their
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
to
these
in
the
morning
I
send
the
captain
,
who
be
to
enter
into
a
parley
with
them
;
in
a
word
,
to
try
them
,
and
tell
me
,
whether
he
think
they
may
be
trust
or
no
,
to
go
on
board
,
and
surprise
the
ship
.
<EOS>
He
talk
to
them
of
the
injury
do
him
,
of
the
condition
they
be
bring
to
;
and
that
though
the
governor
have
give
them
quarter
for
their
life
,
as
to
the
present
action
,
yet
that
if
they
be
send
to
England
,
they
would
all
be
hang
in
chain
,
to
be
sure
;
but
that
if
they
would
join
in
such
an
attempt
as
to
recover
the
ship
,
he
would
have
the
governor
's
engagement
for
their
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
any
one
may
guess
how
readily
such
a
proposal
would
be
accept
by
man
in
their
condition
:
they
fall
down
on
their
knee
to
the
captain
,
and
promise
with
the
deep
imprecation
,
that
they
would
be
faithful
to
him
to
the
last
drop
,
and
that
they
should
owe
their
life
to
him
,
and
would
go
with
him
all
over
the
world
;
that
they
would
own
him
for
a
father
to
them
as
long
as
they
live
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
I
must
go
and
tell
the
governor
what
you
say
,
and
see
what
I
can
do
to
bring
him
to
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
he
bring
me
an
account
of
the
temper
he
find
them
in
;
and
that
he
verily
believe
they
would
be
faithful
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
that
we
may
be
very
secure
,
I
tell
him
he
should
go
back
again
,
and
choose
out
five
of
them
,
and
tell
them
,
that
they
should
see
that
they
do
not
want
man
;
but
he
would
take
out
those
five
to
be
his
assistant
,
and
that
the
governor
would
keep
the
other
two
,
and
the
three
that
be
send
prisoner
to
the
castle
,
(
my
cave
)
as
hostage
for
the
fidelity
of
those
five
;
and
that
if
they
prove
unfaithful
in
the
execution
,
the
five
hostage
should
be
hang
in
chain
alive
upon
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
this
look
severe
,
and
convince
them
that
the
governor
be
in
earnest
;
however
,
they
have
no
way
leave
them
but
to
accept
it
;
and
it
be
now
the
business
of
the
prisoner
,
as
much
as
of
the
captain
,
to
persuade
the
other
five
to
do
their
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Our
strength
be
now
thus
order
for
the
expedition
:
1
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
his
mate
,
and
passenger
.
<EOS>
2
.
<EOS>
then
the
two
prisoner
of
the
first
gang
,
to
whom
,
have
their
character
from
the
captain
,
I
have
give
their
liberty
,
and
trust
them
with
arm
.
<EOS>
3
.
<EOS>
the
other
two
whom
I
keep
till
now
in
my
bower
pinion
;
but
,
upon
the
captain
's
motion
,
have
now
release
.
<EOS>
4
.
<EOS>
these
five
release
at
last
;
so
that
they
be
twelve
in
all
,
besides
five
we
keep
prisoner
in
the
cave
for
hostage
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
the
captain
if
he
be
willing
to
venture
with
these
hand
on
board
the
ship
:
for
,
as
for
me
,
and
my
man
Friday
,
I
do
not
think
it
be
proper
for
us
to
stir
,
have
seven
man
leave
behind
;
and
it
be
employment
enough
for
us
to
keep
them
asunder
,
and
supply
them
with
victual
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
five
in
the
cave
,
I
resolve
to
keep
them
fast
;
but
Friday
go
twice
a
day
to
them
,
to
supply
them
with
necessary
;
and
I
make
the
other
two
carry
provision
to
a
certain
distance
,
where
Friday
be
to
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
shew
myself
to
the
two
hostage
,
it
be
with
the
captain
,
who
tell
them
,
I
be
the
person
the
governor
have
order
to
look
after
them
,
and
that
it
be
the
governor
's
pleasure
that
they
should
not
stir
any
where
but
by
my
direction
;
that
if
they
do
,
they
should
be
fetch
into
the
castle
,
and
be
lay
in
iron
;
so
that
as
we
never
suffer
them
to
see
me
as
governor
,
so
I
now
appear
as
another
person
,
and
speak
of
the
governor
,
the
garrison
,
the
castle
,
and
the
like
,
upon
all
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
now
have
no
difficulty
before
him
,
but
to
furnish
his
two
boat
,
stop
the
breach
of
one
,
and
man
them
:
he
make
his
passenger
captain
of
one
,
with
four
other
man
;
and
himself
,
and
his
mate
,
and
five
more
,
go
in
the
other
:
and
they
contrive
their
business
very
well
;
for
they
come
up
to
the
ship
about
midnight
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
come
within
call
of
the
ship
,
he
make
Robinson
hail
them
,
and
tell
them
he
have
bring
off
the
man
and
the
boat
,
but
that
it
be
a
long
time
before
they
have
find
them
,
and
the
like
;
hold
them
in
a
chat
,
till
they
come
to
the
ship
's
side
;
when
the
captain
and
the
mate
,
enter
first
with
their
arm
,
immediately
knock
down
the
second
mate
and
carpenter
with
the
but
end
of
their
musket
;
be
very
faithfully
second
by
their
man
,
they
seem
all
the
rest
that
be
upon
the
main
and
quarter
deck
,
and
begin
to
fasten
the
hatch
to
keep
them
down
who
be
below
;
when
the
other
boat
and
their
man
,
enter
at
the
fore
chain
,
secure
the
forecastle
of
the
ship
,
and
the
skuttle
which
go
down
into
the
cook
-
room
,
make
three
man
they
find
there
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
and
all
safe
upon
the
deck
,
the
captain
order
the
mate
with
three
man
to
break
into
the
round
-
house
,
where
the
new
rebel
captain
lie
,
and
,
have
take
the
alarm
,
be
get
up
,
and
with
two
man
and
a
boy
have
get
fire
arm
in
their
hand
;
and
when
the
mate
with
a
crow
split
upon
the
door
,
the
new
captain
and
his
man
fire
boldly
among
them
,
and
wound
the
mate
with
a
musket
-
ball
,
which
break
his
arm
,
and
wound
two
more
of
the
man
,
but
kill
nobody
.
  
<EOS>
the
mate
,
call
for
help
,
rush
,
however
,
into
the
round
-
house
,
wound
as
he
be
,
and
with
his
pistol
shoot
the
new
captain
through
the
head
,
the
bullet
enter
at
his
mouth
,
and
come
out
again
behind
one
of
his
ear
;
so
that
he
never
speak
a
word
;
upon
which
the
rest
yield
,
and
the
ship
be
take
effectually
without
any
more
life
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
ship
be
thus
secure
,
the
captain
order
seven
gun
to
be
fire
,
which
be
the
signal
agree
upon
with
me
,
to
give
me
notice
of
his
success
;
which
you
may
be
sure
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
,
have
sit
watch
upon
the
shore
for
it
,
till
near
two
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
hear
the
signal
plainly
,
I
lay
me
down
;
and
it
have
be
a
day
of
great
fatigue
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
sleep
very
sound
,
till
I
be
something
surprised
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
;
and
presently
start
up
,
I
hear
a
man
call
me
by
the
name
of
governor
,
governor
;
and
presently
I
know
the
captain
's
voice
;
when
climb
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
there
he
stand
,
and
point
to
the
ship
,
he
embrace
me
in
his
arm
:
"
My
dear
friend
and
deliverer
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
your
ship
,
for
she
be
all
your
,
and
so
be
we
,
and
all
that
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
cast
my
eye
to
the
ship
,
and
there
she
ride
within
a
little
more
than
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
;
for
they
have
weigh
her
anchor
as
soon
as
they
be
master
of
her
;
and
the
weather
be
fair
,
have
bring
her
to
an
anchor
just
against
the
mouth
of
a
little
creek
;
and
the
tide
be
up
,
the
captain
have
bring
the
pinnace
in
near
the
place
where
I
first
land
my
raft
,
and
so
land
just
at
my
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
at
first
,
ready
to
sink
down
with
the
surprise
;
for
I
see
my
deliverance
indeed
visibly
put
into
my
hand
,
all
thing
easy
,
and
a
large
ship
just
ready
to
carry
me
away
whither
<EOS>
I
please
to
go
;
at
first
,
for
some
time
,
I
be
not
able
to
answer
one
word
;
but
as
he
have
take
me
in
his
arm
,
I
hold
fast
by
him
,
or
I
should
have
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
He
perceive
the
surprise
,
and
immediately
pull
a
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
give
me
a
dram
of
cordial
,
which
he
have
bring
on
purpose
for
me
:
after
I
drink
it
,
I
sit
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
though
it
bring
me
to
myself
,
yet
it
be
a
good
while
before
I
could
speak
a
word
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
the
poor
man
be
in
as
great
an
ecstasy
as
I
,
only
not
under
any
surprise
,
as
I
be
<EOS>
;
and
he
say
a
thousand
kind
tender
thing
to
me
,
to
compose
and
bring
me
to
myself
;
but
such
be
the
flood
of
joy
in
my
breast
,
that
it
put
all
my
spirit
into
confusion
;
at
last
it
break
into
tear
,
and
in
a
little
while
after
I
recover
my
speech
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
take
my
turn
,
and
embrace
him
as
my
deliverer
;
and
we
rejoice
together
;
I
tell
him
,
I
look
upon
him
as
a
man
send
from
Heaven
to
deliver
me
,
and
that
the
whole
transaction
seem
to
be
a
chain
of
wonder
;
that
such
thing
as
these
be
the
testimony
we
have
of
a
secret
hand
of
Providence
govern
the
world
,
and
an
evidence
,
that
the
eye
of
an
infinite
Power
could
search
into
the
remote
corner
of
the
world
,
and
send
help
to
the
miserable
whenever
he
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
forget
not
to
lift
up
my
heart
in
thankfulness
to
Heaven
;
and
what
heart
could
forbear
to
bless
Him
,
<EOS>
who
have
not
only
in
a
miraculous
manner
provide
for
one
in
such
a
wilderness
,
and
in
such
a
desolate
condition
,
but
from
whom
every
deliverance
must
always
be
acknowledge
to
proceed
?
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
talk
awhile
,
the
captain
tell
me
,
he
have
bring
me
some
little
refreshment
,
such
as
the
ship
afford
,
and
such
as
the
wretch
who
have
be
so
long
his
master
,
have
not
plunder
him
of
.
<EOS>
upon
this
he
call
aloud
to
the
boat
,
and
bid
his
man
bring
the
thing
ashore
that
be
for
the
governor
;
and
indeed
it
be
a
present
,
<EOS>
as
if
I
have
be
one
,
not
that
I
be
to
be
carry
along
with
them
,
but
as
if
I
have
be
to
dwell
upon
the
island
still
,
and
they
be
to
go
without
me
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
he
have
bring
me
a
case
of
bottle
full
of
excellent
cordial
water
;
six
large
bottle
of
Madeira
wine
,
the
bottle
hold
two
quart
apiece
;
two
pound
of
excellent
good
tobacco
,
twelve
good
piece
of
the
ship
's
beef
,
and
six
piece
of
pork
,
with
a
bag
of
pea
,
and
about
a
hundred
weight
of
biscuit
.
  
<EOS>
He
bring
me
also
a
box
of
sugar
,
a
box
of
flour
,
a
bag
full
of
lemon
,
and
two
bottle
of
lime
-
juice
,
and
abundance
of
other
thing
:
<EOS>
but
besides
these
,
and
what
be
a
thousand
time
more
useful
to
me
,
he
bring
me
six
clean
new
shirt
,
six
very
good
neckcloth
,
two
pair
of
glove
,
one
pair
of
shoe
,
a
hat
,
and
one
pair
of
stocking
,
and
a
very
good
suit
of
clothe
of
his
own
,
which
have
be
wear
but
very
little
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
clothe
me
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
kind
and
agreeable
present
,
as
any
one
may
imagine
,
to
one
in
my
circumstance
;
but
never
be
any
thing
in
the
world
of
that
kind
so
unpleasant
,
awkward
,
and
uneasy
,
as
it
be
to
me
to
wear
such
clothe
at
their
first
putting
on
.
  
<EOS>
after
these
ceremony
pass
,
and
after
all
his
thing
be
bring
into
my
little
apartment
,
we
begin
to
consult
what
be
to
be
do
with
the
prisoner
we
have
;
for
it
be
worth
consider
whether
we
may
venture
to
take
them
away
with
us
or
no
,
especially
two
of
them
,
whom
we
know
to
be
incorrigible
and
refractory
to
the
last
degree
;
and
the
captain
say
,
he
know
they
be
such
rogue
,
that
there
be
no
oblige
them
;
and
if
he
do
carry
them
away
,
it
must
<EOS>
he
in
iron
,
as
malefactor
,
to
be
deliver
over
to
justice
at
the
first
english
colony
he
could
come
at
;
and
I
find
that
the
captain
himself
be
very
anxious
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
I
tell
him
,
that
,
if
he
desire
it
,
I
durst
undertake
to
bring
the
two
man
he
speak
of
to
make
their
own
request
that
he
should
leave
them
upon
the
island
;
"
I
should
be
very
glad
of
that
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
will
send
for
them
,
and
talk
with
them
for
you
:
"
<EOS>
so
I
cause
Friday
and
the
two
hostage
,
for
they
be
now
discharge
,
their
comrade
have
perform
their
promise
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
I
cause
them
to
go
to
the
cave
,
and
bring
up
the
five
man
,
pinion
as
they
be
,
to
the
bower
,
and
keep
them
there
till
I
come
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
,
I
come
thither
dress
in
my
new
habit
,
and
now
I
be
call
governor
again
.
<EOS>
be
all
meet
,
and
the
captain
with
me
,
I
cause
the
man
to
be
bring
before
me
,
and
I
tell
them
,
I
have
have
a
full
account
of
their
villanous
behaviour
to
the
captain
,
and
how
they
have
run
away
with
the
ship
,
and
be
prepare
to
commit
farth
robbery
;
but
that
Providence
,
have
ensnare
them
in
their
own
way
,
and
that
they
be
fall
into
the
pit
which
they
have
digge
for
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
let
them
know
,
that
by
my
direction
the
ship
have
be
seize
,
that
she
lie
now
in
the
road
,
and
they
may
see
by
and
by
,
that
their
new
captain
have
receive
the
reward
of
his
villany
;
for
that
they
may
see
him
hang
at
the
yard
-
arm
:
that
as
to
them
,
I
want
to
know
what
they
have
to
say
,
why
I
should
not
execute
them
as
pirate
take
in
the
fact
,
as
by
my
commission
they
could
not
doubt
I
have
authority
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
them
answer
in
the
name
of
the
rest
,
that
they
have
nothing
to
say
<EOS>
but
this
,
that
when
they
be
take
,
the
captain
promise
them
their
life
,
and
they
humbly
implore
my
mercy
:
but
I
tell
them
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
mercy
to
shew
them
;
for
,
as
for
myself
,
I
have
resolve
to
quit
the
island
with
all
my
man
,
and
have
take
passage
with
the
captain
to
go
for
England
:
and
as
for
the
captain
,
he
could
not
carry
them
to
England
,
other
than
as
prisoner
in
iron
to
be
try
for
mutiny
,
and
run
away
with
the
ship
;
the
consequence
of
which
they
must
needs
know
,
would
be
the
gallow
;
so
that
I
could
not
tell
which
be
good
for
them
,
unless
they
have
a
mind
to
take
their
fate
in
the
island
;
if
they
desire
that
,
I
do
not
care
,
as
I
have
liberty
to
leave
it
;
I
have
some
inclination
to
give
them
their
life
,
if
they
think
they
could
shift
on
shore
.
<EOS>
They
seem
very
thankful
for
it
;
say
they
would
much
rather
venture
to
stay
there
,
than
to
be
carry
to
England
to
be
hang
;
so
I
leave
it
on
that
issue
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
captain
seem
to
make
some
difficulty
of
it
,
as
if
he
durst
not
leave
them
there
:
upon
this
I
seem
to
be
a
little
angry
with
the
captain
,
and
tell
him
,
that
they
be
my
prisoner
,
not
his
;
and
that
see
I
have
offer
them
so
much
favour
,
I
would
be
as
good
as
my
word
;
and
that
if
he
do
not
think
fit
to
consent
to
it
,
I
would
set
them
at
liberty
as
I
find
them
;
and
if
he
do
not
like
that
,
he
may
take
them
again
if
he
could
catch
them
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
they
appear
very
thankful
,
and
I
accordingly
set
them
at
liberty
,
and
bade
them
retire
into
the
wood
,
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
they
come
,
and
I
would
leave
them
some
fire
-
arm
,
some
ammunition
,
and
some
direction
how
they
should
live
very
well
,
if
they
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
I
prepare
to
go
on
board
the
ship
;
but
tell
the
captain
,
that
I
would
stay
that
night
to
prepare
my
thing
;
and
desire
him
to
go
on
board
in
the
meantime
,
and
keep
all
right
in
the
ship
,
and
send
the
boat
on
shore
the
next
day
for
me
;
order
him
in
the
meantime
to
cause
the
new
captain
who
be
kill
,
to
be
hang
at
the
yard
-
arm
,
that
these
man
may
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
captain
be
go
,
I
send
for
the
man
up
to
me
to
my
apartment
,
and
enter
seriously
into
discourse
with
them
of
their
circumstance
:
I
tell
them
,
I
think
they
have
make
a
right
choice
;
that
if
the
captain
carry
them
away
,
they
would
certainly
be
hang
:
I
shew
them
their
captain
hang
at
the
yard
-
arm
of
the
ship
,
and
tell
them
they
have
nothing
less
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
all
declare
their
willingness
to
stay
,
I
then
tell
them
,
I
would
let
them
into
the
story
of
my
living
there
,
and
put
them
into
the
way
of
make
it
easy
to
them
:
accordingly
I
give
them
the
whole
history
of
the
place
,
and
of
my
come
to
it
:
shew
them
my
fortification
,
the
way
I
make
my
bread
,
plant
my
corn
,
cure
my
grape
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
that
be
necessary
to
make
them
easy
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
the
story
of
the
sixteen
Spaniards
that
be
to
be
expect
;
for
whom
I
leave
a
letter
,
and
make
them
promise
to
treat
them
in
common
with
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
them
my
fire
-
arm
;
viz
.
<EOS>
five
musket
,
three
fowling
-
piece
,
and
three
sword
<EOS>
:
I
have
about
a
barrel
of
powder
leave
;
for
after
the
first
year
or
two
I
use
but
little
,
and
waste
none
.
<EOS>
I
give
them
a
description
of
the
way
I
manage
the
goat
,
and
direction
to
milk
and
fatten
them
,
to
make
both
butter
and
cheese
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
give
them
every
part
of
my
own
story
;
and
I
tell
them
,
I
would
prevail
with
the
captain
to
leave
them
two
barrel
of
gunpowder
more
,
and
some
garden
-
seed
,
which
I
tell
them
I
would
have
be
very
glad
of
;
<EOS>
also
I
give
them
the
bag
of
pea
which
the
captain
have
bring
me
to
eat
,
and
bade
them
be
sure
to
sow
and
increase
them
.
  
<EOS>
have
do
all
this
,
I
leave
them
the
next
day
,
and
go
on
board
the
ship
:
<EOS>
we
prepare
immediately
to
sail
,
but
do
not
weigh
that
night
:
the
next
morning
early
,
two
of
the
five
man
come
swim
to
the
ship
's
side
,
and
make
a
most
lamentable
complaint
of
the
other
three
,
beg
to
be
take
into
the
ship
for
God
's
sake
,
for
they
should
be
murder
;
and
beg
the
captain
to
take
them
on
board
though
he
hang
them
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
the
captain
pretend
to
have
no
power
without
me
;
but
after
some
difficulty
,
and
after
their
solemn
promise
of
amendment
,
they
be
take
on
board
,
and
be
some
time
after
soundly
whip
and
pickle
;
after
which
they
prove
very
honest
and
quiet
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
I
go
with
the
boat
on
shore
,
the
tide
be
up
,
with
the
thing
promise
to
the
man
,
to
which
the
captain
,
at
my
intercession
,
cause
their
chest
and
clothe
to
be
add
,
which
they
take
,
and
be
very
thankful
for
:
<EOS>
I
also
encourage
them
,
by
tell
them
,
that
if
it
lie
in
my
way
to
send
a
vessel
to
take
them
in
,
I
would
not
forget
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
take
leave
of
this
island
,
I
carry
on
board
for
relic
<EOS>
the
great
goat
-
skin
cap
I
have
make
,
my
umbrella
,
and
one
of
my
parrot
;
also
I
forget
not
to
take
the
money
I
formerly
mention
,
which
have
lain
by
me
so
long
useless
that
it
be
grow
rusty
or
tarnished
,
and
could
hardly
pass
for
silver
,
till
it
have
be
a
little
rubbed
and
handle
;
and
also
the
money
I
find
in
the
wreck
of
the
spanish
ship
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
I
leave
the
island
the
nineteenth
of
December
,
as
I
find
by
the
ship
's
account
,
in
the
year
1686
,
after
I
have
be
upon
it
eight
-
and
-
twenty
year
,
two
month
,
and
<EOS>
nineteen
day
:
be
deliver
from
the
second
captivity
the
same
day
of
the
month
that
I
first
make
my
escape
in
the
barco
-
longo
,
from
among
the
Moors
of
Sallee
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
vessel
,
after
a
long
voyage
,
I
arrive
in
England
the
eleventh
of
June
,
in
the
year
1687
;
have
be
thirty
and
five
year
absent
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
England
,
I
be
a
perfect
stranger
to
all
the
world
,
as
if
I
have
never
be
know
there
:
my
benefactor
,
and
faithful
steward
,
whom
I
have
leave
in
trust
with
my
money
,
be
alive
,
but
have
have
great
misfortune
in
the
world
,
be
become
a
widow
the
second
time
,
and
very
low
in
the
world
:
I
make
her
easy
as
to
what
she
owe
me
,
assure
her
I
would
give
her
no
trouble
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
in
gratitude
to
her
former
care
and
faithfulness
to
me
,
I
relieve
her
as
my
little
stock
would
afford
,
which
at
that
time
would
indeed
allow
me
to
do
but
little
for
her
:
but
I
assure
her
,
I
would
never
forget
her
former
kindness
to
me
;
nor
do
I
forget
her
,
when
I
have
sufficient
to
help
her
;
as
shall
be
observe
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
down
afterwards
into
Yorkshire
;
but
my
father
be
dead
,
and
my
mother
and
all
the
family
extinct
;
except
that
I
find
two
sister
,
and
two
of
the
child
of
one
of
my
brother
:
and
as
I
have
be
long
ago
give
over
for
dead
,
there
have
be
no
provision
make
for
me
,
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
I
find
nothing
to
relieve
or
assist
me
;
and
that
little
money
I
have
,
would
not
do
much
for
me
as
to
settle
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
meet
with
one
piece
of
gratitude
indeed
,
which
I
do
not
expect
;
and
this
be
,
that
the
master
of
the
ship
,
whom
I
have
so
happily
deliver
,
and
by
the
same
mean
save
the
ship
and
cargo
,
have
give
a
very
handsome
account
to
the
owner
,
of
the
manner
how
I
have
save
the
life
of
the
man
,
and
the
ship
,
they
invite
me
to
meet
them
and
some
other
merchant
concern
,
and
all
together
make
me
a
very
handsome
compliment
upon
that
subject
,
and
a
present
of
almost
two
hundred
pound
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
make
several
reflection
upon
the
circumstance
of
my
life
,
and
how
little
way
this
would
go
towards
settle
me
in
the
world
,
I
resolve
to
go
to
Lisbon
,
and
see
if
I
may
not
come
by
some
information
of
the
state
of
my
plantation
in
the
Brasils
,
and
what
be
become
of
my
partner
,
who
,
I
have
reason
to
suppose
,
have
some
year
now
give
me
over
for
dead
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
view
I
take
ship
for
Lisbon
,
where
I
arrive
in
April
follow
;
my
man
Friday
accompany
me
very
honestly
in
all
these
rambling
,
and
prove
a
most
faithful
servant
upon
all
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
Lisbon
,
I
find
out
,
by
inquiry
,
and
to
my
particular
satisfaction
,
my
old
friend
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
who
first
take
me
up
at
sea
,
off
the
shore
of
Africa
:
he
be
now
grow
old
,
and
have
leave
off
the
sea
,
have
put
his
son
,
who
be
far
from
a
young
man
,
into
his
ship
;
and
who
still
use
the
Brasil
trade
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
do
not
know
me
,
and
,
indeed
,
I
hardly
know
him
;
but
I
soon
bring
myself
to
his
remembrance
,
when
I
tell
him
who
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
passionate
expression
of
our
old
acquaintance
,
I
inquire
,
you
may
be
sure
,
after
my
plantation
and
my
partner
;
the
old
man
tell
me
,
he
have
not
be
in
the
Brasils
for
about
nine
year
;
but
that
he
could
assure
me
,
that
when
he
come
away
,
my
partner
be
live
;
but
the
trustee
,
whom
I
have
join
with
him
,
to
take
cognizance
of
my
part
,
be
both
dead
;
that
,
however
,
he
believe
that
I
would
have
a
very
good
account
of
the
improvement
of
the
plantation
;
for
that
,
upon
the
general
belief
of
my
be
cast
away
and
drown
,
my
trustee
have
give
in
the
account
of
the
produce
of
my
part
of
the
plantation
,
to
the
procurator
fiscal
;
who
have
appropriate
it
,
in
case
I
never
come
to
claim
it
,
one
third
to
the
king
,
and
two
third
to
the
monastery
of
St.
Augustine
,
to
be
expend
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
,
and
for
the
conversion
of
the
Indians
to
the
catholic
faith
;
but
that
if
I
appear
,
or
any
one
for
me
,
to
claim
the
inheritance
,
it
would
be
restore
;
only
that
the
improvement
,
or
annual
production
,
be
distribute
to
charitable
use
,
could
not
be
restore
;
but
he
assure
me
,
that
the
steward
of
the
king
's
revenue
,
(
from
land
)
and
the
provedore
,
or
steward
of
the
monastery
,
have
take
great
care
all
along
,
that
the
incumbent
,
that
be
to
say
,
my
partner
,
give
every
year
a
faithful
account
of
the
produce
,
of
which
they
receive
duly
my
moiety
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
if
he
know
to
what
height
of
improvement
he
have
bring
the
plantation
;
and
whether
he
think
it
may
be
worth
look
after
;
or
whether
,
on
my
go
thither
,
I
should
meet
with
no
obstruction
to
my
possess
my
just
right
in
the
moiety
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
he
could
not
tell
exactly
to
what
degree
the
plantation
be
improve
;
but
this
he
know
,
that
my
partner
be
grow
exceed
rich
upon
the
enjoy
but
one
half
of
it
;
and
that
,
to
the
good
of
his
remembrance
,
he
have
hear
,
that
the
king
's
third
of
my
part
,
which
be
,
it
seem
,
grant
away
to
some
other
monastery
,
or
religious
house
,
amount
to
above
two
hundred
moidore
a
year
;
that
,
as
to
my
be
restore
to
a
quiet
possession
of
it
,
there
be
no
question
to
be
make
of
that
,
my
partner
be
alive
to
witness
my
title
,
and
my
name
be
also
enrol
in
the
register
of
the
county
.
<EOS>
also
he
tell
me
,
that
the
survivor
of
my
two
trustee
be
very
fair
,
honest
people
,
and
very
wealthy
,
and
he
believe
I
would
not
only
have
their
assistance
for
put
me
in
possession
,
but
would
find
a
very
considerable
sum
of
money
in
their
hand
for
my
account
,
be
the
produce
of
the
farm
,
while
their
father
hold
the
trust
,
and
before
it
be
give
up
,
as
above
,
which
,
as
he
remember
,
be
about
twelve
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
shew
myself
a
little
concerned
and
uneasy
at
this
account
,
and
inquire
of
the
old
captain
,
how
it
come
to
pass
,
that
the
trustee
should
thus
dispose
of
my
effect
,
when
he
know
that
I
have
make
my
will
,
and
have
make
him
,
the
portuguese
captain
,
my
universal
heir
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
be
true
;
but
that
,
as
there
be
no
proof
of
my
be
dead
,
he
could
not
act
as
executor
,
until
some
certain
account
should
come
of
my
death
;
and
that
,
besides
,
he
be
not
willing
to
intermeddle
with
a
thing
so
remote
:
that
it
be
true
,
he
have
register
my
will
,
and
put
in
his
claim
;
and
could
he
have
give
any
account
of
my
be
dead
or
alive
,
he
would
have
act
by
procuration
,
and
take
possession
of
the
ingenio
,
<EOS>
(
so
they
call
the
sugarhouse
)
and
have
give
his
son
,
who
be
now
at
the
Brasils
,
order
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
I
have
one
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
,
which
perhaps
may
not
be
so
acceptable
to
you
as
the
rest
;
and
that
is
,
that
believe
you
be
lose
,
and
all
the
world
believe
<EOS>
so
also
,
your
partner
and
trustee
do
offer
to
account
to
me
in
your
name
,
for
six
or
eight
of
the
first
year
of
profit
,
which
I
receive
;
but
there
be
at
that
time
,
"
say
he
,
"
great
disbursement
for
increase
the
work
,
build
an
ingenio
and
buy
slave
<EOS>
,
it
do
not
amount
to
near
so
much
as
afterwards
it
produce
:
however
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
I
shall
give
you
a
true
account
of
what
I
have
receive
in
all
,
and
how
I
have
dispose
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
few
day
farth
conference
with
this
ancient
friend
,
be
bring
me
an
account
of
the
six
first
year
income
of
my
plantation
,
sign
by
my
partner
,
and
the
merchant
'
trustee
,
be
always
deliver
in
good
;
viz
.
<EOS>
tobacco
in
roll
,
and
sugar
in
chest
,
besides
rum
,
molasses
,
&
c.
which
be
the
consequence
of
a
sugar
-
work
;
and
I
find
by
this
account
,
that
every
year
the
income
considerably
increase
:
but
,
as
above
,
the
disbursement
be
large
<EOS>
,
the
sum
at
first
be
small
:
however
,
the
old
man
let
me
see
,
that
he
be
debtor
to
me
four
hundred
and
seventy
moidore
of
gold
,
besides
sixty
chest
of
sugar
,
and
fifteen
double
roll
of
tobacco
,
which
be
lose
in
his
ship
,
he
have
be
shipwreck
come
home
to
Lisbon
,
about
eleven
year
after
my
leave
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
man
then
begin
to
complain
of
his
misfortune
,
and
how
he
have
be
oblige
to
make
use
of
my
money
to
recover
his
loss
,
and
buy
him
a
share
in
a
new
ship
;
"
however
,
my
old
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
shall
not
want
a
supply
in
your
necessity
;
and
as
soon
as
my
son
return
,
you
shall
be
fully
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
he
pull
out
an
old
pouch
,
and
give
me
two
hundred
Portugal
moidore
in
gold
;
and
give
me
the
writing
of
his
title
to
the
ship
which
his
son
be
go
to
the
Brasils
in
,
of
which
he
be
a
quarter
part
owner
,
and
his
son
another
,
he
put
them
both
in
my
hand
for
security
of
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
too
much
move
with
the
honesty
and
kindness
of
the
poor
man
,
to
be
able
to
bear
this
;
and
remember
what
he
have
do
for
me
,
how
he
have
take
me
up
at
sea
,
and
how
generously
he
have
use
me
on
all
occasion
,
and
particularly
how
sincere
a
friend
<EOS>
he
be
now
to
me
,
I
could
hardly
refrain
weep
at
what
he
say
to
me
:
<EOS>
therefore
,
first
I
ask
him
if
his
circumstance
admit
him
to
spare
so
much
money
at
that
time
,
and
if
it
would
not
straiten
him
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
could
not
say
<EOS>
but
it
may
straiten
him
a
little
;
but
,
however
,
it
be
my
money
,
and
I
may
want
it
more
than
he
.
  
<EOS>
every
thing
the
good
man
say
be
full
of
affection
,
and
I
could
hardly
refrain
from
tear
while
he
spake
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
take
one
hundred
of
the
moidore
,
and
call
for
a
pen
and
ink
to
give
him
a
receipt
for
them
;
then
I
return
him
the
rest
,
and
tell
him
,
if
ever
I
have
possession
of
the
plantation
,
I
would
return
the
other
to
him
also
,
as
indeed
I
afterwards
do
;
and
then
,
as
to
the
bill
of
sale
of
his
part
in
his
son
's
ship
,
I
would
not
take
it
by
any
mean
;
but
that
if
I
want
the
money
,
I
find
he
be
honest
enough
to
pay
me
;
and
if
I
do
not
,
but
come
to
receive
what
he
give
me
reason
to
expect
,
I
would
never
have
a
penny
more
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
be
past
,
the
old
man
begin
to
ask
me
if
he
should
put
me
in
a
method
to
make
my
claim
to
my
plantation
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
think
to
go
over
to
it
myself
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
may
do
so
if
I
please
;
but
that
if
I
do
not
,
there
be
way
enough
to
secure
my
right
,
and
immediately
to
appropriate
the
profit
to
my
use
;
and
as
there
be
ship
in
the
river
of
Lisbon
,
just
ready
to
go
away
to
Brasil
,
he
make
me
enter
my
name
in
a
public
register
,
with
his
affidavit
,
affirm
upon
oath
that
I
be
alive
,
and
that
I
be
the
same
person
who
take
up
the
land
for
the
planting
the
say
plantation
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
regularly
attest
by
a
notary
,
and
the
procuration
affix
,
he
direct
me
to
send
it
with
a
letter
of
his
writing
,
to
a
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
at
the
place
;
and
then
propose
my
staying
with
him
till
an
account
come
of
the
return
.
  
<EOS>
never
any
thing
be
more
honourable
than
the
proceeding
upon
this
procuration
;
for
in
less
than
seven
month
I
receive
a
large
packet
from
the
survivor
of
my
trustee
,
the
merchant
,
on
whose
account
I
go

sea

in

an
account
how
the
estate

and
what

a
year
,
with
a
particular
of
the
number
of
square
or
acre
that
it
contain
;
how
plant
,
how
many
slave
there
be
upon
it
,
and
make
two
and
twenty
crosse
for
blessing
,
tell
me
he
have
say
so
many
Ave
Marias
to
thank
the
Blessed
Virgin
that
I
be
alive
;
invite
me
very
passionately
to
come
over
and
take
possession
of
my
own
;
and
in
the
mean
time
to
give
him
order
to
whom
he
should
deliver
my
effect
,
if
I
do
not
come
my
self
;
conclude
with
a
hearty
tender
of
his
friendship
,
and
that
of
his
family
,
and
send
me
,
as
a
present
,
seven
fine
leopard
's
skin
,
which
he
have
it
seem
receive
from
Africa
,
by
some
other
ship
which
he
have
send
thither
,
and
who
it
seem
have
make
a
well
voyage
than
I
<EOS>
:
he
send
me
also
five
chest
of
excellent
sweetmeat
,
and
an
hundred
piece
of
gold
uncoine
,
not
quite
so
large
as
moidore
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
same
fleet
,
my
two
merchant
trustee
ship
me
1,200
chest
of
sugar
,
800
roll
of
tobacco
,
and
the
rest
of
the
whole
Account
in
gold
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
well
say
,
now
indeed
,
that
the
latter
end
of
Job
be
well
than
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
here
the
fluttering
of
my
very
heart
,
when
I
look
over
these
letter
,
and
especially
when
I
find
all
my
wealth
about
me
;
for
as
the
Brasil
ship
come
all
in
fleet
,
the
same
ship
which
bring
my
letter
,
bring
my
good
;
and
the
effect
be
safe
in
the
river
before
the
letter
come
to
my
hand
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
turn
pale
,
and
grow
sick
;
and
have
not
the
old
man
run
and
fetch
me
a
cordial
,
I
believe
the
sudden
surprize
of
joy
have
overset
nature
,
and
I
have
die
upon
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
nay
after
that
,
I
continue
very
ill
,
and
be
so
some
hour
,
 
'
till
a
physician
be
send
for
,
and
something
of
the
real
cause
of
my
illness
be
know
,
he
order
me
to
be
let
blood
;
after
which
,
I
have
relief
,
and
grow
well
:
<EOS>
but
I
verily
believe
,
if
it
have
not
be
ease
by
a
vent
give
in
that
manner
,
to
the
spirit
,
I
should
have
die
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
master
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
of
above
5000l
.
<EOS>
sterling
in
money
,
and
have
an
estate
,
as
I
may
well
call
it
,
in
the
Brasils
,
of
above
a
thousand
pound
a
year
,
as
sure
as
an
estate
of
land
in
England
:
and
in
a
word
,
I
be
in
a
condition
which
I
scarce
know
how
to
understand
,
or
how
to
compose
my
self
,
for
the
enjoyment
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
do
,
be
to
recompense
my
original
benefactor
,
my
good
old
captain
,
who
have
be
first
charitable
to
me
in
my
distress
,
kind
to
me
in
my
beginning
,
and
honest
to
me
at
the
end
:
I
shew
him
all
that
be
send
me
,
I
tell
him
,
that
next
to
the
Providence
of
Heaven
,
which
dispose
all
thing
,
it
be
owe
to
him
;
and
that
it
now
lie
on
me
to
reward
him
,
which
I
would
do
a
hundred
fold
:
<EOS>
so
I
first
return
to
him
the
hundred
moidore
I
have
receive
of
him
<EOS>
,
then
I
send
for
a
notary
,
and
cause
him
to
draw
up
a
general
release
or
discharge
for
the
470
moidore
,
which
he
have
acknowledge
he
owe
me
in
the
full
and
firmest
manner
possible
;
after
which
,
I
cause
a
procuration
to
be
draw
,
impowere
him
to
be
my
receiver
of
the
annual
profit
of
my
plantation
,
and
appoint
my
partner
to
account
to
him
,
and
make
the
return
by
the
usual
fleet
to
him
in
my
name
;
and
a
clause
in
the
end
,
be
a
grant
of
100
moidore
a
year
to
him
,
during
his
life
,
out
of
the
effect
,
and
50
moidore
a
year
to
his
son
after
him
,
for
his
life
:
<EOS>
and
thus
I
requite
my
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
to
consider
which
way
to
steer
my
course
next
,
and
what
to
do
with
the
estate
that
Providence
have
thus
put
into
my
hand
;
and
indeed
I
have
more
care
upon
my
head
now
,
than
I
have
in
my
silent
state
of
life
in
the
island
,
where
I
want
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
I
have
,
and
have
nothing
but
what
I
want
:
whereas
I
have
now
a
great
charge
upon
me
,
and
my
business
be
how
to
secure
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
ne'er
a
cave
now
to
hide
my
money
in
,
or
a
place
where
it
may
lie
without
lock
or
key
,
 
'
till
it
grow
mouldy
and
tarnish
before
any
body
would
meddle
with
it
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
know
not
where
to
put
it
,
or
who
to
trust
with
it
.
<EOS>
My
old
patron
,
the
captain
,
indeed
be
honest
,
and
that
be
the
only
refuge
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
my
interest
in
the
Brasils
seem
to
summon
me
thith
,
but
now
I
could
not
tell
,
how
to
think
of
go
thither
,
 
'
till
I
have
settle
my
affair
,
and
leave
my
effect
in
some
safe
hand
behind
me
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
think
of
my
old
friend
the
widow
,
who
I
know
be
honest
,
and
would
be
just
to
me
;
but
then
she
be
in
year
,
and
but
poor
,
and
for
ought
I
know
,
may
be
in
debt
;
so
that
in
a
word
,
I
have
no
way
but
to
go
back
to
England
my
self
,
and
take
my
effect
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
month
however
before
I
resolve
upon
this
;
and
therefore
,
as
I
have
reward
the
old
captain
fully
,
and
to
his
satisfaction
,
who
have
be
my
former
benefactor
,
so
I
begin
to
think
of
my
poor
widow
,
whose
husband
have
be
my
first
benefactor
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
while
it
be
in
her
power
,
my
faithful
steward
and
instructor
.
<EOS>
so
the
first
thing
I
do
,
I
get
a
merchant
in
Lisbon
to
write
to
his
correspondent
in
London
,
not
only
to
pay
a
bill
,
but
to
go
find
her
out
,
and
carry
her
in
money
,
an
hundred
pound
from
me
,
and
to
talk
with
her
,
and
comfort
her
in
her
poverty
,
by
tell
her
she
should
,
if
I
live
,
have
a
further
supply
:
at
the
same
time
I
send
my
two
sister
in
the
country
,
each
of
them
an
hundred
pound
,
they
be
,
though
not
in
want
,
yet
not
in
very
good
circumstance
;
one
have
be
marry
,
and
leave
a
widow
;
and
the
other
have
a
husband
not
so
kind
to
her
as
he
should
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
among
all
my
relation
,
or
acquaintance
,
I
could
not
yet
pitch
upon
one
,
to
whom
I
durst
commit
the
gross
of
my
stock
,
that
I
may
go
away
to
the
Brasils
,
and
leave
thing
safe
behind
me
;
and
this
greatly
perplex
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
once
a
mind
to
have
go
to
the
Brasils
,
and
have
settle
my
self
there
;
for
I
be
,
as
it
be
,
naturalize
to
the
place
;
but
I
have
some
little
scruple
in
my
mind
about
religion
,
which
insensibly
draw
me
back
,
of
which
I
shall
say
more
presently
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
not
religion
that
keep
me
from
go
thither
for
the
present
;
and
as
I
have
make
no
scruple
of
be
openly
of
the
religion
of
the
country
,
all
the
while
I
be
among
them
,
so
neither
do
I
yet
;
only
that
now
and
then
have
of
late
thought
more
of
it
than
formerly
,
<EOS>
when
I
begin
to
think
of
living
and
die
among
them
,
I
begin
to
regret
my
have
profess
myself
a
Papist
,
and
think
it
may
not
be
the
good
religion
to
die
in
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
say
,
this
be
not
the
main
thing
that
keep
me
from
go
to
the
Brasils
,
but
that
really
I
do
not
know
with
whom
to
leave
my
effect
behind
me
;
so
I
resolve
at
last
to
go
to
England
with
them
,
where
if
I
arrive
,
I
conclude
I
should
make
some
acquaintance
,
or
find
some
relation
,
that
would
be
faithful
to
me
;
and
accordingly
I
prepare
to
go
for
England
with
all
my
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
prepare
thing
for
my
go
home
,
I
first
(
the
Brasil
fleet
be
just
go
away
)
resolve
to
give
answer
suitable
to
the
just
and
faithful
account
of
thing
I
have
from
thence
;
and
first
to
the
prior
of
St.
Augustine
<EOS>
I
write
a
letter
full
of
thank
for
his
just
dealing
,
and
the
offer
of
the
eight
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
moidore
,
which
be
undisposed
of
,
which
I
desire
may
be
give
,
five
hundred
to
the
monastery
,
and
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
to
the
poor
,
as
the
prior
should
direct
,
desire
the
good
Padre
's
prayer
for
me
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
I
write
next
a
letter
of
thank
to
my
two
trustee
,
with
all
the
acknowledgment
that
so
much
justice
and
honesty
call
for
;
as
for
send
them
any
present
,
they
be
far
above
have
any
occasion
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
lastly
,
I
write
to
my
partner
,
acknowledge
his
industry
in
the
improve
the
plantation
,
and
his
integrity
in
increase
the
stock
of
the
work
,
give
him
instruction
for
his
future
government
of
my
part
accord
to
the
power
I
have
leave
with
my
old
patron
,
to
whom
I
desire
him
to
send
whatever
become
due
to
me
,
till
he
should
hear
from
me
more
particularly
;
assure
him
,
that
it
be
my
intention
,
not
only
to
come
to
him
,
but
to
settle
myself
there
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
add
a
very
handsome
present
of
some
italian
silk
for
his
wife
and
two
daughter
,
for
such
the
captain
's
son
inform
me
he
have
;
with
two
piece
of
fine
english
broad
-
cloth
,
the
good
I
could
get
in
Lisbon
,
five
piece
of
black
bay
,
and
some
Flanders
lace
of
a
good
value
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
settle
my
affair
,
sell
my
cargo
,
and
turn
all
my
effect
into
good
bill
of
exchange
,
my
next
difficulty
be
,
which
way
to
go
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
accustom
enough
to
the
sea
,
and
yet
I
have
a
strange
aversion
to
go
to
England
by
sea
at
that
time
;
and
though
I
could
give
no
reason
for
it
,
yet
the
difficulty
increase
upon
me
so
much
,
that
though
I
have
once
ship
my
baggage
in
order
to
go
,
yet
I
alter
my
mind
,
and
that
not
once
,
but
two
or
three
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
I
have
be
very
unfortunate
by
sea
,
and
this
may
be
one
of
the
reason
.
<EOS>
but
let
no
man
slight
the
strong
impulse
of
his
own
thought
in
case
of
such
moment
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
ship
which
I
have
single
out
to
go
in
,
I
mean
more
particularly
single
out
than
any
other
,
that
be
to
say
,
so
as
in
one
of
them
to
put
my
thing
on
board
,
and
in
the
other
to
have
agree
with
the
captain
;
I
say
,
two
of
these
ship
miscarry
,
viz
.
<EOS>
one
be
take
by
the
Algerines
,
and
the
other
be
cast
away
on
the
Start
,
near
Torbay
,
and
all
the
people
drown
except
three
;
so
that
in
either
of
those
vessel
I
have
be
make
miserable
,
and
in
which
most
,
it
be
hard
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
have
be
thus
harass
in
my
thought
,
my
old
pilot
,
to
whom
I
communicate
every
thing
,
press
me
earnestly
not
to
go
to
sea
;
but
either
to
go
by
land
to
the
Groyne
,
and
cross
over
the
Bay
of
Biscay
to
Rochelle
,
from
whence
it
be
but
an
easy
and
safe
journey
by
land
to
Paris
,
and
so
to
Calais
and
Dover
;
or
to
go
up
to
Madrid
,
and
so
all
the
way
by
land
through
France
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
be
so
prepossess
against
my
going
by
sea
at
all
,
except
from
Calais
to
Dover
,
that
I
resolve
to
travel
all
the
way
by
land
;
which
,
as
I
be
not
in
haste
,
and
do
not
value
the
charge
,
be
by
much
the
pleasanter
way
;
and
to
make
it
more
so
,
my
old
captain
bring
an
english
gentleman
,
the
son
of
a
merchant
in
Lisbon
,
who
be
willing
to
travel
with
me
;
after
which
,
we
pick
up
two
who
be
English
,
and
merchant
also
,
and
two
young
portuguese
gentleman
,
the
last
go
to
Paris
only
;
so
that
we
be
in
all
six
of
us
,
and
five
servant
,
the
two
merchant
and
the
two
Portuguese
content
themselves
with
one
servant
between
two
,
to
save
the
charge
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
get
an
english
sailor
to
travel
with
me
as
a
servant
,
besides
my
man
Friday
,
who
be
too
much
a
stranger
to
be
capable
of
supply
the
place
of
a
servant
upon
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
I
set
out
from
Lisbon
;
and
our
company
be
all
very
well
mount
and
armed
,
we
make
a
little
troop
<EOS>
whereof
they
do
me
the
honour
to
call
me
captain
,
as
well
because
I
be
the
old
man
,
as
because
I
have
two
servant
,
and
indeed
be
the
original
of
the
whole
journey
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
trouble
you
with
none
of
my
sea
journal
,
so
shall
I
trouble
you
with
none
of
my
land
journal
.
<EOS>
but
some
adventure
that
happen
to
us
in
this
tedious
and
difficult
journey
,
I
must
not
omit
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
Madrid
,
we
,
be
all
of
us
stranger
to
Spain
,
be
willing
to
stay
some
time
to
sec
the
court
of
Spain
,
and
to
see
what
be
worth
observe
;
but
it
be
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
,
we
hasten
away
,
and
set
out
from
Madrid
about
the
middle
of
October
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
come
to
the
edge
of
Navarre
,
we
be
alarm
at
several
town
on
the
way
,
with
an
account
that
so
much
snow
be
fall
on
the
french
side
of
the
mountain
,
that
several
traveller
be
oblige
to
come
back
to
Pampeluna
,
after
have
attempt
,
at
an
extreme
hazard
,
to
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
Pampeluna
itself
,
we
find
it
so
indeed
;
and
to
me
that
have
be
always
use
to
a
hot
climate
,
and
indeed
to
country
where
we
could
scarce
bear
any
clothe
on
,
the
cold
be
insufferable
;
nor
,
indeed
,
be
it
more
painful
than
it
be
surprising
:
to
come
but
ten
day
before
out
of
the
Old
Castile
,
where
the
weather
be
not
only
warm
,
but
very
hot
,
and
immediately
to
feel
a
wind
from
the
Pyrenees
mountain
,
so
very
keen
,
so
severely
cold
,
as
to
be
intolerable
,
and
to
endanger
benumbing
and
perishing
of
our
finger
and
toe
,
be
very
strange
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Friday
be
really
fright
when
he
see
the
mountain
all
cover
with
snow
,
and
feel
cold
weather
,
which
he
have
never
see
or
feel
before
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
to
mend
the
matter
,
after
we
come
to
Pampeluna
,
it
continue
snow
with
so
much
violence
,
and
so
long
,
that
the
people
say
,
winter
be
come
before
its
time
;
and
the
road
,
which
be
difficult
before
,
be
now
quite
impassable
:
in
a
word
,
the
snow
lie
in
some
place
too
thick
for
us
to
travel
;
and
be
not
hard
freeze
,
as
be
the
case
in
northern
country
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
go
without
be
in
danger
of
be
bury
alive
every
step
.
<EOS>
We
staid
no
less
than
twenty
day
at
Pampeluna
;
when
(
see
the
winter
come
on
,
and
no
likelihood
of
its
be
well
,
for
it
be
the
severe
winter
all
over
Europe
that
have
be
know
in
many
year
)
propose
that
we
should
all
go
away
to
Fontarabia
,
and
there
take
shipping
for
Boardeaux
,
which
be
a
very
little
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
we
be
consider
this
,
there
come
in
four
french
gentleman
,
who
,
have
be
stop
on
the
french
side
of
the
pass
,
as
we
be
on
the
Spanish
,
have
find
out
a
guide
,
who
traverse
the
country
near
the
head
of
Languedoc
,
have
bring
them
over
the
mountain
by
such
way
,
that
they
be
not
much
incommode
with
the
snow
;
and
where
they
meet
with
snow
in
any
quantity
<EOS>
,
they
say
it
be
freeze
hard
enough
to
bear
them
and
their
horse
.
  
<EOS>
We
send
for
this
guide
,
who
tell
us
,
he
would
undertake
to
carry
us
the
same
way
,
with
no
hazard
from
the
snow
,
provide
we
be
arm
sufficiently
to
protect
us
from
wild
beast
:
for
he
say
,
upon
these
great
snow
,
it
be
frequent
for
some
wolf
to
show
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
be
make
ravenous
for
want
of
food
,
the
ground
be
cover
with
snow
.
<EOS>
We
tell
him
we
be
well
enough
prepare
for
such
creature
as
they
be
,
if
he
would
ensure
us
from
a
kind
of
two
-
legged
wolf
,
which
we
be
tell
we
be
in
most
danger
from
,
especially
on
the
french
side
of
the
mountain
.
  
<EOS>
He
satisfy
us
<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
of
that
kind
in
the
way
that
we
be
to
go
:
so
we
readily
agree
to
follow
him
;
as
do
also
twelve
other
gentleman
,
with
their
servant
,
some
French
,
some
Spanish
,
who
,
as
I
say
,
have
attempt
to
go
,
and
be
oblige
to
come
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
all
set
out
from
Pampeluna
,
with
our
guide
,
on
the
fifteenth
of
November
;
and
indeed
I
be
surprised
,
when
,
instead
of
go
forward
,
he
come
directly
back
with
us
,
on
the
same
road
that
we
come
from
Madrid
,
above
twenty
mile
;
when
have
pass
two
river
,
and
come
into
the
plain
country
,
we
find
ourselves
in
a
warm
climate
again
,
where
the
country
be
pleasant
,
and
no
snow
to
be
see
;
but
on
a
sudden
,
turn
to
the
left
,
he
approach
the
mountain
another
way
;
and
though
it
be
true
,
the
hill
and
the
precipice
look
dreadfully
,
yet
he
make
so
many
tour
,
such
meander
,
and
lead
us
by
such
wind
way
<EOS>
,
we
insensibly
pass
the
height
of
the
mountain
,
without
be
much
encumber
with
the
snow
;
and
all
on
a
sudden
he
shew
us
the
pleasant
fruitful
province
of
Languedoc
and
Gascoigne
,
all
green
and
flourishing
;
though
indeed
they
be
at
a
great
distance
,
and
we
have
some
rough
way
to
pass
yet
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
a
little
uneasy
,
however
,
when
we
find
it
snow
one
whole
day
and
a
night
,
so
fast
,
that
we
could
not
travel
;
but
he
bid
us
be
easy
,
we
should
soon
be
past
it
all
:
we
find
,
indeed
,
that
we
begin
to
descend
every
day
,
and
to
come
more
north
than
before
;
and
so
,
depend
upon
our
guide
,
we
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
two
hour
before
night
,
when
our
guide
be
something
before
us
,
and
not
just
in
sight
,
out
rush
three
monstrous
wolf
,
and
after
them
a
bear
,
out
of
a
hollow
way
,
adjoin
to
a
thick
wood
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
wolf
fly
upon
the
guide
,
and
have
he
be
half
a
mile
before
us
,
he
have
be
devour
indeed
,
before
we
could
have
help
him
;
one
of
them
fasten
upon
his
horse
,
and
the
other
attack
the
man
with
that
violence
,
that
he
have
not
time
,
or
not
presence
of
mind
enough
,
to
draw
his
pistol
,
but
hallooed
and
cry
out
to
us
most
lustily
.
<EOS>
My
man
Friday
be
next
to
me
,
I
bid
him
ride
up
,
and
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Friday
come
in
sight
of
the
man
,
he
halloo
,
as
loud
as
the
other
,
"
o
master
'
o
master
!
"
<EOS>
but
,
like
a
bold
fellow
,
ride
directly
up
to
the
man
,
and
with
his
pistol
shoot
the
wolf
that
attack
him
in
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
happy
for
the
poor
man
that
it
be
my
man
Friday
;
for
he
,
have
be
use
to
that
kind
of
creature
in
his
country
,
have
no
fear
upon
him
,
but
go
close
up
to
him
,
and
shoot
him
as
above
;
whereas
any
of
us
would
have
fire
at
a
farth
distance
,
and
have
perhaps
either
miss
the
wolf
,
or
endanger
shoot
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
enough
to
have
terrify
a
bold
man
than
I
,
and
indeed
it
alarm
all
our
company
,
when
,
with
the
noise
of
Friday
's
pistol
,
we
hear
on
both
side
the
dismall
howling
of
wolf
,
and
<EOS>
the
noise
redouble
by
the
echo
of
the
mountain
,
that
it
be
to
us
as
if
there
have
be
a
prodigious
multitude
of
them
;
and
perhaps
indeed
there
be
not
such
a
few
,
as
that
we
have
no
cause
of
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
Friday
have
kill
this
wolf
,
the
other
,
that
have
fasten
upon
the
horse
,
leave
him
immediately
,
and
flee
,
have
happily
fasten
upon
his
head
,
where
the
boss
of
the
bridle
have
stick
in
his
tooth
,
so
that
he
have
not
do
him
much
hurt
;
the
man
,
indeed
,
be
most
hurt
;
for
the
rage
creature
have
bite
him
twice
,
once
on
the
arm
,
and
the
other
time
a
little
above
his
knee
;
and
he
be
just
as
it
be
tumble
down
by
the
disorder
of
the
horse
,
when
Friday
come
up
and
shoot
the
wolf
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
suppose
,
that
at
the
noise
of
Friday
's
pistol
we
all
mend
our
pace
,
and
rid
up
as
fast
as
the
way
(
which
be
very
difficult
)
would
give
us
leave
,
to
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
come
clear
of
the
tree
which
blind
us
before
,
we
see
plainly
what
have
be
the
case
,
and
how
Friday
have
disengage
the
poor
guide
;
though
we
do
not
presently
discern
wind
kind
of
creature
<EOS>
it
be
he
have
kill
.
  
<EOS>
but
never
be
a
fight
manage
so
hardily
,
and
in
such
a
surprising
manner
,
as
that
which
follow
between
Friday
and
the
bear
,
which
give
us
all
(
though
at
first
we
be
surprised
and
afraid
for
him
)
<EOS>
the
great
diversion
imaginable
.
<EOS>
as
the
bear
be
a
heavy
,
clumsy
creature
,
and
do
not
gallop
as
the
wolf
do
,
which
be
swift
and
light
;
so
he
have
two
particular
quality
,
which
generally
be
the
rule
of
his
action
:
<EOS>
first
,
as
to
man
,
who
be
not
his
proper
prey
,
I
say
not
his
proper
prey
,
because
though
I
can
not
say
what
excessive
hunger
may
do
,
which
be
now
their
case
,
the
ground
be
all
cover
with
snow
;
yet
as
to
man
,
he
do
not
usually
attempt
them
,
unless
they
first
attack
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
if
you
meet
him
in
the
wood
,
if
you
do
not
meddle
with
him
,
he
will
not
meddle
with
you
;
yet
then
you
must
take
care
to
be
very
civil
to
him
,
and
give
him
the
road
;
for
he
be
a
very
nice
gentleman
,
he
will
not
go
a
step
out
of
the
way
for
a
prince
;
nay
,
if
you
be
really
afraid
,
your
good
way
be
to
look
another
way
,
and
keep
go
on
;
for
sometimes
,
if
you
stop
,
and
stand
still
,
and
look
steadfastly
at
him
,
he
take
it
for
an
affront
;
and
if
you
throw
or
toss
any
thing
at
him
,
and
it
hit
him
,
though
it
be
but
a
bit
of
stick
as
big
as
your
finger
,
he
take
it
for
an
affront
,
and
set
all
other
business
aside
to
pursue
his
revenge
;
for
he
will
have
satisfaction
in
point
of
honour
,
and
this
be
his
first
quality
;
the
next
be
,
that
if
he
be
once
affront
,
he
will
never
leave
you
,
night
or
day
,
till
he
have
his
revenge
,
but
follow
at
a
good
round
rate
till
he
overtake
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
man
Friday
have
deliver
our
guide
,
and
when
we
come
up
to
him
,
he
be
help
him
off
from
his
horse
;
for
the
man
be
both
hurt
and
fright
,
and
indeed
the
last
more
than
the
first
;
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
we
espy
the
bear
come
out
of
the
wood
,
and
a
very
monstrous
one
it
be
,
the
big
by
far
that
ever
I
see
:
we
be
all
a
little
surprised
when
we
see
him
;
but
when
Friday
see
him
,
it
be
easy
to
see
joy
and
courage
in
the
fellow
's
countenance
:
"
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
"
say
Friday
,
three
time
,
point
to
him
,
"
o
master
!
<EOS>
you
give
me
te
leave
,
me
<EOS>
shakee
te
hand
with
him
,
me
makee
you
good
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
see
the
fellow
so
pleased
:
"
You
fool
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
he
will
eat
you
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
eatee
me
up
!
<EOS>
eatee
me
up
!
"
say
Friday
,
twice
over
again
;
"
me
eatee
him
up
;
me
make
you
good
laugh
;
you
all
stay
here
,
me
shew
<EOS>
you
good
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
down
he
sit
and
get
his
boot
off
in
a
moment
,
and
put
on
a
pair
of
pump
,
(
as
we
call
the
flat
shoe
they
wear
)
and
which
he
have
in
his
pocket
,
and
give
my
other
servant
his
horse
,
and
with
his
gun
away
he
fly
,
swift
like
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
the
bear
be
walk
softly
on
,
and
offer
to
meddle
with
nobody
,
till
Friday
come
pretty
near
,
call
to
him
,
as
if
the
bear
could
understand
him
:
"
Hark
ye
,
hark
ye
,
"
say
Friday
,
"
me
speakee
<EOS>
wit
you
,
<EOS>
"
We
follow
at
a
distance
;
for
now
be
come
down
to
the
Gascoigne
side
of
the
mountain
,
we
be
enter
a
vast
great
forest
,
where
the
country
be
plain
,
and
pretty
open
,
though
many
tree
in
it
scatter
here
and
there
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
,
who
have
,
as
we
say
,
the
heel
of
the
bear
,
come
up
with
him
quickly
,
and
take
up
a
great
stone
,
and
throw
at
him
,
and
hit
him
just
on
the
head
;
but
do
him
no
more
harm
than
if
he
have
throw
it
against
a
wall
;
but
it
answer
Friday
's
end
;
for
the
rogue
be
so
void
of
fear
,
that
he
do
it
purely
to
make
the
bear
follow
him
,
and
shew
us
some
laugh
,
as
he
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
bear
feel
the
stone
,
and
see
him
,
he
turn
about
,
and
come
after
him
,
take
devilish
long
stride
,
and
stroll
along
at
a
strange
rate
,
so
as
he
would
put
a
horse
to
a
middling
gallop
.
<EOS>
away
run
Friday
,
and
take
his
course
,
as
if
he
run
towards
us
for
help
;
so
we
all
resolve
to
fire
at
once
upon
the
bear
,
and
deliver
my
man
;
though
I
be
angry
at
him
heartily
for
bring
the
bear
back
upon
us
,
when
he
be
go
about
his
own
business
another
way
;
and
especially
I
be
angry
that
he
have
turn
the
bear
upon
us
,
and
then
run
away
;
and
I
call
out
,
"
You
dog
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
this
your
make
us
laugh
?
<EOS>
come
away
,
and
take
your
horse
,
that
we
may
shoot
the
creature
.
"
<EOS>
He
hear
me
,
and
cry
out
,
"
no
shoot
,
no
shoot
,
stand
still
,
you
get
much
laugh
;
"
and
as
the
nimble
creature
run
two
foot
for
the
beast
's
one
,
he
turn
on
a
sudden
,
on
one
side
of
us
,
and
see
a
great
oak
tree
,
fit
for
his
purpose
,
he
beckon
us
to
follow
,
and
double
his
pace
,
he
get
nimbly
up
the
tree
,
lay
his
gun
down
upon
the
ground
,
at
about
five
or
six
yard
from
the
bottom
of
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
the
bear
soon
come
to
the
tree
,
and
we
follow
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
he
do
,
he
stop
at
the
gun
,
smell
to
it
,
but
let
it
lie
,
and
up
he
scramble
into
the
tree
,
climb
like
a
cat
,
though
so
monstrous
heavy
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
at
the
folly
,
as
I
think
it
,
of
my
man
,
and
could
not
for
my
life
see
any
thing
to
laugh
at
yet
,
till
see
the
bear
get
up
the
tree
,
we
all
ride
nearer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
tree
,
there
be
Friday
get
out
to
the
small
of
a
large
limb
of
the
tree
,
and
the
bear
get
about
half
way
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
bear
get
out
to
that
part
where
the
limb
of
the
tree
be
weak
,
"
ha
,
"
say
he
to
us
,
"
<EOS>
now
you
see
me
teachee
the
bear
dance
;
"
so
he
fall
a
-
jump
,
and
shake
the
bough
,
at
which
the
bear
begin
to
totter
,
but
stand
still
,
and
begin
to
look
behind
him
,
to
see
how
he
should
get
back
;
then
indeed
we
do
laugh
heartily
.
<EOS>
but
Friday
have
not
do
with
him
by
a
great
deal
:
when
he
see
him
stand
still
<EOS>
,
he
call
out
to
him
again
,
as
if
he
have
suppose
the
bear
could
speak
English
,
"
what
,
you
come
no
farther
?
<EOS>
pray
you
come
farther
.
"
<EOS>
so
he
leave
jump
and
shake
the
bough
;
and
the
bear
,
just
as
if
he
understand
what
he
say
,
do
come
a
little
farther
;
then
he
fall
a
-
jumping
again
,
and
the
bear
stop
again
.
  
<EOS>
We
think
now
be
a
good
time
to
knock
him
on
the
head
,
and
call
to
Friday
to
stand
still
,
and
we
would
shoot
the
bear
;
but
he
cry
out
earnestly
,
"
o
pray
!
<EOS>
o
pray
!
<EOS>
no
shoot
,
me
shoot
by
and
then
;
"
he
would
have
say
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
shorten
the
story
,
Friday
dance
so
much
,
and
the
bear
stand
so
ticklish
,
that
we
have
laugh
enough
indeed
,
but
still
could
not
imagine
what
the
fellow
would
do
;
for
first
we
think
he
depend
upon
shake
the
bear
off
;
and
we
find
the
bear
be
too
cunning
for
that
too
;
for
he
would
not
get
out
far
enough
to
be
throw
down
,
but
cling
fast
with
his
great
broad
claw
and
foot
,
so
that
we
could
not
imagine
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
,
and
where
the
jest
would
be
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
but
Friday
put
us
out
of
doubt
quickly
;
for
see
the
bear
cle
fast
to
the
bough
,
and
that
he
would
not
be
persuade
to
come
any
farther
;
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
Friday
,
"
you
no
come
farther
<EOS>
,
me
go
,
me
go
;
you
no
come
to
me
,
me
come
to
you
;
"
and
upon
this
he
go
out
to
the
small
end
of
the
bough
,
where
it
would
bend
with
his
weight
,
and
gently
let
himself
down
by
it
,
slide
down
the
bough
,
till
he
come
near
enough
to
jump
down
on
his
foot
;
and
away
he
run
to
his
gun
,
take
it
up
,
and
stand
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
Friday
,
what
will
you
do
now
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
shoot
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
shoot
,
"
say
Friday
,
"
no
yet
;
me
shoot
now
me
<EOS>
no
kill
<EOS>
;
me
stay
,
give
you
one
more
laugh
;
"
and
indeed
so
he
do
,
as
you
will
see
presently
;
for
when
the
bear
see
his
enemy
go
,
he
come
back
from
the
bough
where
he
stand
,
but
do
it
mighty
leisurely
,
look
behind
him
every
step
,
and
come
backward
till
he
get
into
the
body
of
the
tree
;
then
with
the
same
hinder
end
foremost
,
he
come
down
the
tree
;
grasp
it
with
his
claws
,
and
move
one
foot
at
a
time
,
very
leisurely
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
and
just
before
he
could
set
his
hind
foot
upon
the
ground
,
Friday
step
close
to
him
,
clap
the
muzzle
of
his
piece
into
his
ear
,
and
shoot
him
as
dead
as
a
stone
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
rogue
turn
about
to
see
if
we
do
not
laugh
;
and
when
he
see
we
be
pleased
by
our
look
,
he
fall
a
-
laugh
himself
very
loud
;
"
so
we
kill
bear
in
my
country
,
"
say
Friday
.
<EOS>
"
so
you
kill
them
?
"
say
I
;
"
why
,
you
have
no
gun
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
no
gun
,
but
shoot
great
much
long
arrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
indeed
,
a
good
diversion
to
us
;
but
we
be
still
in
a
wild
place
,
and
our
guide
very
much
hurt
,
and
what
to
do
we
hardly
know
:
<EOS>
the
howling
of
wolf
run
much
in
my
head
;
and
indeed
except
the
noise
I
once
hear
on
the
shore
of
Africa
,
of
which
I
have
say
something
already
<EOS>
,
I
never
hear
any
thing
that
fill
me
with
so
much
horror
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
,
and
the
approach
of
night
,
call
us
off
,
or
else
,
as
Friday
would
have
have
us
,
we
should
certainly
have
take
the
skin
of
this
monstrous
creature
off
,
which
be
worth
save
;
but
we
have
three
league
to
go
,
and
our
guide
hasten
us
;
so
we
leave
him
,
and
go
forward
on
our
journey
.
  
<EOS>
the
ground
be
still
cover
with
snow
,
though
not
so
deep
and
dangerous
as
on
the
mountain
;
and
the
ravenous
creature
,
as
we
hear
afterwards
,
be
come
down
into
the
forest
and
plain
country
,
press
by
hunger
,
to
seek
for
food
,
and
have
do
a
great
deal
of
mischief
in
the
village
,
where
they
surprise
the
country
-
people
,
kill
a
great
many
of
their
sheep
and
horse
,
and
some
people
too
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
one
dangerous
place
to
pass
,
of
which
our
guide
tell
us
,
if
there
be
any
more
wolf
in
the
country
,
we
should
find
them
there
;
and
this
be
a
small
plain
,
surround
with
wood
on
every
side
,
and
a
long
narrow
defile
or
lane
,
which
we
be
to
pass
to
get
through
the
wood
,
and
then
we
should
come
to
the
village
where
we
be
to
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
within
half
an
hour
of
sunset
when
we
enter
the
first
wood
;
and
a
little
after
sunset
,
when
we
come
into
the
plain
.
<EOS>
We
meet
with
nothing
in
the
first
wood
,
except
that
in
a
little
plain
within
the
wood
,
which
be
not
above
two
furlong
over
,
we
see
five
great
wolf
cross
the
road
,
full
speed
one
after
another
,
as
if
they
have
be
in
chase
of
some
prey
,
and
have
it
in
view
:
they
take
no
notice
of
us
,
and
be
go
and
out
of
sight
in
a
few
moment
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
our
guide
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
be
a
wretched
faint
-
hearted
fellow
,
bade
us
keep
in
a
ready
posture
;
for
he
believe
there
be
more
wolf
a
-
coming
.
  
<EOS>
We
keep
our
arm
ready
,
and
our
eye
about
us
;
but
we
see
no
more
wolf
till
we
come
through
that
wood
,
which
be
near
half
a
league
,
and
enter
the
plain
:
as
soon
as
we
come
into
the
plain
,
we
have
occasion
enough
to
look
about
us
.
<EOS>
the
first
object
we
meet
with
be
a
dead
horse
<EOS>
,
that
be
to
say
,
a
poor
horse
which
the
wolf
have
kill
,
and
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
at
work
;
we
could
not
say
eat
of
him
,
but
picking
of
his
bone
rather
;
for
they
have
eat
up
all
the
flesh
before
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
not
think
fit
to
disturb
them
at
their
feast
,
neither
do
they
take
much
notice
of
us
:
Friday
would
have
let
fly
at
them
,
but
I
would
not
suffer
him
by
any
mean
;
for
I
find
we
be
like
to
have
more
business
upon
our
hand
than
we
be
aware
of
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
half
go
over
the
plain
,
but
we
begin
to
hear
the
wolf
howl
in
the
wood
,
on
our
left
,
in
a
frightful
manner
;
and
presently
after
we
see
about
a
hundred
come
on
directly
towards
us
,
all
in
a
body
,
and
most
of
them
in
a
line
,
as
regularly
as
an
army
draw
up
by
experienced
officer
.
<EOS>
I
scarce
know
in
what
manner
to
receive
them
;
but
find
to
draw
ourselves
in
a
close
line
be
the
only
way
;
so
we
form
in
a
moment
;
but
,
that
we
may
not
have
too
much
interval
,
I
order
,
that
only
every
other
man
should
fire
;
and
that
the
other
,
who
have
not
fire
,
should
stand
ready
to
give
them
a
second
volley
immediately
,
if
they
continue
to
advance
upon
us
;
and
that
then
those
who
have
fire
at
first
,
should
not
pretend
to
load
their
fusil
again
,
but
stand
ready
,
with
every
one
a
pistol
,
for
we
be
all
arm
with
a
fusil
and
a
pair
of
pistol
each
man
;
so
we
be
,
by
this
method
,
able
to
fire
six
vollie
,
half
of
us
at
a
time
;
however
,
at
present
we
have
no
necessity
;
for
,
upon
fire
the
first
volley
,
the
enemy
make
a
full
stop
,
be
terrify
,
as
well
with
the
noise
as
with
the
fire
;
four
of
them
be
shoot
in
the
head
,
drop
;
several
other
be
wound
,
and
go
bleed
off
,
as
we
could
see
by
the
snow
.
<EOS>
I
find
they
stop
,
but
do
not
immediately
retreat
;
<EOS>
whereupon
,
remember
that
I
have
be
tell
,
that
the
fierce
creature
be
terrify
at
the
voice
of
a
man
,
I
cause
all
our
company
to
halloo
as
loud
as
we
could
,
and
I
find
the
notion
not
altogether
mistaken
;
for
upon
our
shout
,
they
begin
to
retire
,
and
turn
about
;
then
I
order
a
second
volley
to
be
fire
in
their
rear
,
which
put
them
to
the
gallop
,
and
away
they
go
to
the
wood
.
  
<EOS>
this
give
us
leisure
to
charge
our
piece
again
,
and
that
we
may
lose
no
time
,
we
keep
do
;
but
we
have
but
little
more
than
load
our
fusil
,
and
put
ourselves
into
a
readiness
,
when
we
hear
a
terrible
noise
in
the
same
wood
on
our
left
;
only
that
it
be
farther
onward
the
same
way
we
be
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
come
on
,
and
the
night
begin
to
be
dusky
,
which
make
it
the
bad
on
our
side
;
but
,
the
noise
increase
,
we
could
easily
perceive
that
it
be
the
howling
and
yelling
of
those
hellish
creature
;
and
,
on
a
sudden
,
we
perceive
two
or
three
troop
of
wolf
on
our
left
,
one
behind
us
,
and
one
on
our
front
,
so
that
we
seem
to
be
surround
with
them
;
however
,
as
they
do
not
fall
upon
us
,
we
keep
our
way
forward
,
as
fast
as
we
could
make
our
horse
go
,
which
,
the
way
be
very
rough
,
be
only
a
good
large
trot
;
and
in
this
manner
we
only
come
in
view
of
the
entrance
of
the
wood
through
which
we
be
to
pass
,
at
the
farther
side
of
the
plain
;
but
we
be
greatly
surprised
,
when
,
come
near
the
lane
,
or
pass
,
we
see
a
confused
number
of
wolf
stand
just
at
the
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
,
at
another
opening
of
the
wood
,
we
hear
the
noise
of
a
gun
;
and
,
look
that
way
,
out
rush
a
horse
,
with
a
saddle
and
a
bridle
on
him
,
fly
like
the
wind
,
and
sixteen
or
seventeen
wolf
after
him
full
speed
:
indeed
the
horse
have
the
heel
of
them
;
but
as
we
suppose
that
he
could
not
hold
it
at
that
rate
,
we
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
they
would
get
up
with
him
at
last
;
and
<EOS>
no
question
<EOS>
but
they
do
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
have
a
most
horrible
sight
;
for
,
ride
up
to
the
entrance
where
the
horse
come
out
,
we
find
the
carcass
of
another
horse
,
and
of
two
man
devour
by
these
ravenous
creature
,
and
of
one
the
man
be
no
doubt
the
same
whom
we
hear
fire
<EOS>
a
gun
,
for
there
lie
a
gun
just
by
him
fire
off
;
but
as
to
the
man
,
his
head
,
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
,
be
eat
up
.
  
<EOS>
this
fill
us
with
horror
,
and
we
know
not
what
course
to
take
;
but
the
creature
resolve
us
soon
,
for
they
gather
about
us
presently
,
in
hope
of
prey
;
and
I
verily
believe
there
be
three
hundred
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
happen
very
much
to
our
advantage
,
that
at
the
entrance
into
the
wood
,
but
a
little
way
from
it
,
there
by
some
large
timber
tree
,
which
have
be
cut
down
the
summer
before
,
and
I
suppose
lie
there
for
carriage
:
I
draw
my
little
troop
in
among
these
tree
,
and
place
ourselves
in
a
line
behind
one
long
tree
,
I
advise
them
all
to
alight
,
and
keep
that
tree
before
us
for
a
breastwork
,
to
stand
in
a
triangle
,
or
three
front
,
enclose
our
horse
in
the
centre
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
so
,
and
it
be
well
we
do
;
for
never
be
a
more
furious
charge
than
the
creature
make
upon
us
in
this
place
;
they
come
on
us
with
a
growl
kind
of
a
noise
,
and
mount
the
piece
of
timber
(
which
,
as
I
say
,
be
our
breastwork
,
)
as
if
they
be
only
rush
upon
their
prey
;
and
this
fury
of
theirs
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
be
principally
occasion
by
their
see
our
horse
behind
us
,
which
be
the
prey
they
aim
at
.
<EOS>
I
order
our
man
to
fire
as
before
,
every
man
;
and
they
take
their
aim
so
sure
,
that
indeed
they
kill
several
of
the
wolf
at
the
first
volley
;
but
there
be
a
necessity
to
keep
a
continual
firing
,
for
they
come
on
like
devil
,
those
behind
push
on
those
before
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
fire
our
second
volley
of
fusil
,
we
think
they
stop
a
little
,
and
I
hope
they
would
have
go
off
,
but
it
be
but
a
moment
,
for
other
come
forward
again
;
so
we
fire
our
vollie
of
pistol
;
and
I
believe
in
these
four
firing
we
kill
seventeen
or
eighteen
of
them
,
and
lame
twice
as
many
;
yet
they
come
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
loath
to
spend
our
last
shot
too
hastily
;
so
I
call
my
servant
,
not
my
man
Friday
,
for
he
be
better
employ
;
for
,
with
the
great
dexterity
imaginable
,
he
charge
my
fusil
and
his
own
,
while
we
be
engage
;
but
,
as
I
say
,
I
call
my
other
man
;
and
give
him
a
horn
of
powder
<EOS>
,
I
bid
him
lie
a
train
all
along
the
piece
of
timber
,
and
let
it
be
a
large
train
;
he
do
so
,
and
have
but
time
to
get
away
,
when
the
wolf
come
up
to
it
,
and
some
be
get
up
upon
it
;
when
I
,
snap
an
uncharged
pistol
close
to
the
powder
,
set
it
on
fire
;
and
those
that
be
upon
the
timber
be
scorch
with
it
,
and
six
or
seven
of
them
fall
,
or
rather
jump
in
among
us
,
with
the
force
and
fright
of
the
fire
;
we
dispatch
these
in
an
instant
,
and
the
rest
be
so
fright
with
the
light
,
which
the
night
,
for
now
it
be
very
near
dark
,
make
more
terrible
,
that
they
draw
back
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
upon
which
I
order
our
last
pistol
to
be
fire
off
in
one
volley
,
and
after
that
we
give
a
shout
;
upon
this
the
wolf
turn
tail
,
and
we
sally
immediately
upon
near
twenty
lame
one
,
which
we
find
struggle
on
the
ground
,
and
fall
a
-
cut
them
with
our
sword
,
which
answer
our
expectation
;
for
the
crying
and
howling
they
make
be
better
understand
by
their
fellow
;
so
that
they
flee
and
leave
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
,
first
and
last
,
kill
about
three
score
of
them
;
and
have
it
be
daylight
,
we
have
kill
many
more
.
<EOS>
the
field
of
battle
be
thus
clear
,
we
make
forward
again
;
for
we
have
still
near
a
league
to
go
.
<EOS>
We
hear
the
ravenous
creature
howl
and
yell
in
the
wood
as
we
go
,
several
time
;
and
sometimes
we
fancy
we
see
some
of
them
,
but
the
snow
dazzle
our
eye
<EOS>
,
we
be
not
certain
;
so
in
about
an
hour
more
we
come
to
the
town
,
where
we
be
to
lodge
,
which
we
find
in
a
terrible
fright
,
and
all
in
arm
;
for
it
seem
,
that
,
the
night
before
,
the
wolf
and
some
bear
have
break
into
that
village
,
and
put
them
in
a
terrible
fright
;
and
they
be
oblige
to
keep
guard
night
and
day
,
but
especially
in
the
night
,
to
preserve
their
cattle
,
and
indeed
their
people
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
our
guide
be
so
ill
,
and
his
limb
so
swell
with
the
rankling
of
his
two
wound
,
that
he
could
go
no
farther
;
so
we
be
oblige
to
take
a
new
guide
there
,
and
go
to
Tholouse
,
where
we
find
a
warm
climate
,
a
fruitful
pleasant
country
,
and
no
snow
,
no
wolf
,
or
any
thing
like
them
;
but
when
we
tell
our
story
at
Tholouse
,
they
tell
us
it
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
ordinary
in
the
great
forest
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
especially
when
the
snow
lie
on
the
ground
;
but
they
inquire
much
what
kind
of
a
guide
we
have
get
,
that
would
venture
to
bring
us
that
way
in
such
a
severe
season
;
and
tell
us
,
it
be
very
much
we
be
not
all
devour
.
<EOS>
when
we
tell
them
how
we
place
ourselves
,
and
the
horse
in
the
middle
,
they
blame
us
exceedingly
,
and
tell
us
it
be
fifty
to
one
<EOS>
but
we
have
be
all
destroy
;
for
it
be
the
sight
of
the
horse
that
make
the
wolf
so
furious
,
see
their
prey
;
and
that
at
other
time
they
be
really
afraid
of
a
gun
;
but
they
be
excessive
hungry
,
and
rage
on
that
account
,
the
eagerness
to
come
at
the
horse
have
make
them
senseless
of
danger
;
and
that
if
we
have
not
by
the
continue
fire
,
and
at
last
by
the
stratagem
of
the
train
of
powder
,
master
them
,
it
have
be
great
odd
but
that
we
have
be
tear
to
piece
;
whereas
,
have
we
be
content
to
have
sit
still
on
horseback
,
and
fire
as
horseman
,
they
would
not
have
take
the
horse
so
much
for
their
own
,
when
man
be
on
their
back
,
as
otherwise
;
and
withal
they
tell
us
,
that
at
last
,
if
we
have
stand
all
together
,
and
leave
our
horse
,
they
would
have
be
so
eager
to
have
devour
them
,
that
we
may
have
come
off
safe
,
especially
have
our
fire
-
arm
in
our
hand
,
and
be
so
many
in
number
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
never
so
sensible
of
danger
in
my
life
;
for
see
above
three
hundred
devil
come
roar
and
open
-
mouthed
to
devour
us
,
and
have
nothing
to
shelter
us
,
or
retreat
to
,
I
give
myself
over
for
lose
;
and
as
it
be
,
I
believe
,
I
shall
never
care
to
cross
those
mountain
again
;
I
think
I
would
much
rather
go
a
thousand
league
by
sea
,
though
I
be
sure
to
meet
with
a
storm
once
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
uncommon
to
take
notice
of
in
my
passage
through
France
;
nothing
but
what
other
traveller
have
give
an
account
of
,
with
much
more
advantage
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
travel
from
Tholouse
to
Paris
,
and
without
any
considerable
stay
come
to
Calais
,
and
land
safe
at
Dover
,
the
fourteenth
of
January
,
after
have
have
a
severe
cold
season
to
travel
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
come
to
the
centre
of
my
travel
,
and
have
in
a
little
time
all
my
new
-
discover
estate
safe
about
me
,
the
bill
of
exchange
,
which
I
bring
with
me
,
have
be
very
currently
pay
.
  
<EOS>
My
principal
guide
and
privy
-
counsellor
be
my
good
ancient
widow
,
who
,
in
gratitude
for
the
money
I
have
send
her
,
think
no
pain
too
much
,
or
care
too
great
,
to
employ
for
me
;
and
I
trust
her
so
entirely
with
every
thing
,
that
I
be
perfectly
easy
as
to
the
security
of
my
effect
;
and
indeed
I
be
very
happy
from
my
beginning
,
and
now
to
the
end
,
in
the
unspotted
integrity
of
this
good
gentlewoman
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
begin
to
think
of
leave
my
effect
with
this
woman
,
and
set
out
for
Lisbon
,
and
so
to
the
Brasils
.
<EOS>
but
now
another
scruple
come
in
the
way
,
and
that
be
religion
;
for
as
I
have
entertain
some
doubt
about
the
roman
religion
,
even
while
I
be
abroad
,
especially
in
my
state
of
solitude
;
so
I
know
there
be
no
go
to
the
Brasils
for
me
,
<EOS>
much
less
go
to
settle
there
,
unless
I
resolve
to
embrace
the
roman
catholic
religion
,
without
any
reserve
;
except
on
the
other
hand
I
resolve
to
be
a
sacrifice
to
my
principle
,
be
a
martyr
for
religion
,
and
die
in
the
inquisition
:
<EOS>
so
I
resolve
to
stay
at
home
,
and
,
if
I
could
find
mean
for
it
,
to
dispose
of
my
plantation
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
purpose
I
write
to
my
old
friend
at
Lisbon
,
who
in
return
give
me
notice
,
that
he
could
easily
dispose
of
it
there
:
but
that
if
I
think
fit
to
give
him
leave
to
offer
it
in
my
name
to
the
two
merchant
,
the
survivor
of
my
trustee
,
who
live
in
the
Brasils
,
who
must
fully
understand
the
value
of
it
,
who
live
just
upon
the
spot
,
and
who
I
know
to
be
very
rich
,
so
that
he
believe
they
would
be
fond
of
buy
it
;
he
do
not
doubt
,
but
I
should
make
4
or
5000
piece
of
eight
the
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
agree
,
give
him
order
to
offer
it
to
them
,
and
he
do
so
;
and
in
about
eight
month
more
,
the
ship
be
then
return
,
he
send
me
an
account
,
that
they
have
accept
the
offer
,
and
have
remit
33,000
piece
of
eight
to
a
correspondent
of
theirs
at
Lisbon
,
to
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
return
,
I
sign
the
instrument
of
sale
in
the
form
which
they
send
from
Lisbon
,
and
send
it
to
my
old
man
,
who
send
me
the
bill
of
exchange
for
32,800
piece
of
eight
for
the
estate
;
reserve
the
payment
of
100
moidore
a
year
,
to
him
(
the
old
man
)
during
his
life
,
and
50
moidore
afterwards
to
his
son
for
his
life
,
which
I
have
promise
them
;
and
which
the
plantation
be
to
make
good
as
a
rent
charge
.
<EOS>
and
thus
I
have
give
the
first
part
of
a
life
of
fortune
and
adventure
,
a
life
of
Providence
's
chequer
-
work
,
and
of
a
variety
which
the
world
will
seldom
be
able
to
shew
the
like
of
:
begin
foolishly
,
but
close
much
more
happily
than
any
part
of
it
<EOS>
ever
give
me
leave
to
much
as
to
hope
for
.
  
<EOS>
any
one
would
think
,
that
in
this
state
of
complicated
good
fortune
,
I
be
past
run
any
more
hazard
,
and
so
indeed
I
have
be
,
if
other
circumstance
have
concur
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
inure
to
a
wander
life
,
have
no
family
,
nor
many
relation
;
nor
,
however
rich
,
have
I
contract
much
acquaintance
;
and
though
I
have
sell
my
estate
in
the
Brasils
,
yet
I
could
not
keep
that
country
out
of
my
head
,
and
have
a
great
mind
to
be
upon
the
wing
again
;
especially
I
could
not
resist
the
strong
inclination
I
have
to
see
my
island
,
and
to
know
if
the
poor
Spaniards
be
in
be
there
;
and
how
the
rogue
I
leave
there
have
use
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
true
friend
the
widow
earnestly
dissuade
me
from
it
,
and
so
far
prevailed
with
me
,
that
almost
for
seven
year
she
prevent
my
run
abroad
;
during
which
time
I
take
my
two
nephew
,
the
child
of
one
of
my
brother
,
into
my
care
:
<EOS>
the
eld
have
something
of
his
own
,
I
breed
up
as
a
gentleman
and
give
him
a
settlement
of
some
addition
to
his
estate
,
after
my
decease
;
<EOS>
the
other
I
put
out
to
a
captain
of
a
ship
;
and
after
five
year
,
find
him
a
sensible
,
bold
,
enterprise
young
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
put
him
into
a
good
ship
,
and
send
him
to
sea
:
and
this
young
fellow
afterwards
draw
me
in
,
as
old
as
I
be
,
to
farther
adventure
myself
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
in
part
settle
myself
here
;
for
,
first
of
all
,
I
marry
,
and
that
not
either
to
my
disadvantage
or
dissatisfaction
;
and
have
three
child
,
two
son
and
one
daughter
:
but
my
wife
die
,
and
my
nephew
come
home
with
good
success
from
a
voyage
to
Spain
,
my
inclination
to
go
abroad
,
and
his
importunity
,
prevail
,
and
engage
me
to
go
in
his
ship
as
a
private
trader
to
the
East
Indies
.
<EOS>
this
in
the
year
1694
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
voyage
I
visit
my
new
colony
in
the
island
,
see
my
successor
the
Spaniards
,
have
the
whole
story
of
their
life
,
and
of
the
villain
I
leave
there
;
how
at
first
they
insult
the
poor
Spaniards
,
how
they
afterwards
agree
,
disagree
,
united
,
separate
,
and
how
at
last
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
be
oblige
to
use
violence
with
them
;
how
they
be
subject
to
the
Spaniards
;
how
honestly
the
Spaniards
use
them
;
an
history
,
if
it
be
enter
into
,
as
full
of
variety
and
wonderful
accident
as
my
own
part
:
particularly
also
as
to
their
battle
with
the
Caribbeans
,
who
land
several
time
upon
the
island
,
and
as
to
the
improvement
they
make
upon
the
island
itself
;
and
how
five
of
them
make
an
attempt
upon
the
main
land
,
and
bring
away
eleven
man
and
five
woman
prisoner
;
by
which
,
at
my
coming
,
I
find
about
twenty
young
child
on
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
stay
about
twenty
day
;
leave
them
supply
of
all
necessary
thing
,
and
particularly
of
arm
,
powder
,
shot
,
clothe
,
tool
,
and
two
workman
,
which
I
bring
from
England
with
me
;
viz
.
<EOS>
a
carpenter
and
a
smith
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
,
I
share
the
land
into
part
with
them
,
reserve
to
myself
the
property
of
the
whole
,
but
give
them
such
part
respectively
,
as
they
agree
on
;
and
,
have
settle
all
thing
with
them
,
and
engage
them
not
to
leave
the
place
,
I
leave
them
there
.
  
<EOS>
from
thence
I
touch
at
the
Brasils
,
from
whence
I
send
a
bark
,
which
I
buy
there
,
with
more
people
to
the
island
;
and
in
it
,
besides
other
supply
,
I
send
seven
woman
,
be
such
as
I
find
proper
for
service
,
or
for
wife
to
such
as
would
take
them
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Englishmen
,
I
promise
them
to
send
them
some
woman
from
England
,
with
a
good
cargo
of
necessary
,
if
they
would
apply
themselves
to
plant
;
which
I
afterwards
could
not
perform
:
<EOS>
the
fellow
prove
very
honest
and
diligent
,
after
they
be
master
,
and
have
their
property
set
apart
for
them
,
I
send
them
also
from
the
Brasils
five
cow
,
three
of
them
be
big
with
calf
,
some
sheep
,
and
some
hog
,
which
,
when
I
come
again
,
be
considerably
increase
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
these
thing
,
with
an
account
how
three
hundred
Caribbees
come
and
invade
them
,
and
ruin
their
plantation
,
and
how
they
fight
with
that
whole
number
twice
,
and
be
at
first
defeat
and
some
of
them
kill
;
but
at
last
a
storm
destroy
their
enemy
'
canoe
,
they
famish
or
destroy
almost
all
the
rest
,
and
renew
and
recover
the
possession
of
their
plantation
,
and
still
live
upon
the
island

all
these
thing
,
with
some
very
surprising
incident
in
some
new
adventure
of
my
own
,
for
ten
year
more
I
may

perhaps
,
give
a
further
account

<EOS>
that
homely
proverb
use
on
so
many
occasion
in
England
,
viz
.
"
<EOS>
that
what
be
breed
in
the
bone
will
not
go
out
of
the
flesh
,
"
be
never
more
verified
than
in
the
story
of
my
Life
.
<EOS>
any
one
would
think
,
that
after
thirty
-
five
year
affliction
,
and
a
variety
of
unhappy
circumstance
,
which
few
man
,
if
any
,
ever
go
through
before
,
and
after
near
seven
year
of
peace
and
enjoyment
in
the
fulness
of
all
thing
;
grow
old
,
and
when
,
if
ever
,
it
may
be
allow
me
to
have
have
experience
of
every
state
of
middle
life
,
and
to
know
which
be
most
adapt
to
make
a
man
completely
happy
;
I
say
,
after
all
this
,
any
one
would
have
think
that
the
native
propensity
to
rambling
,
which
I
give
an
account
of
in
my
first
set
out
into
the
world
to
have
be
so
predominant
in
my
thought
,
should
be
wear
out
,
the
volatile
part
be
fully
evacuate
,
or
at
least
condense
,
and
I
may
at
sixty
-
one
year
of
age
have
be
a
little
inclined
to
stay
at
home
,
and
have
do
venture
life
and
fortune
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
nay
farther
,
the
common
motive
of
foreign
adventure
be
take
away
in
me
;
for
I
have
no
fortune
to
make
,
I
have
nothing
to
seek
:
<EOS>
if
I
have
gain
ten
thousand
pound
,
I
have
be
no
rich
;
for
I
have
already
sufficient
for
me
,
and
for
those
I
have
to
leave
it
to
,
and
that
I
have
be
visibly
increase
;
for
have
no
great
family
,
I
could
not
spend
the
income
of
what
I
have
,
unless
I
would
set
up
for
an
expensive
way
of
living
,
such
as
a
great
family
,
servant
,
equipage
,
gaiety
,
and
the
like
,
which
be
thing
I
have
no
notion
of
,
or
inclination
to
;
so
that
I
have
nothing
indeed
to
do
,
but
to
sit
still
,
and
fully
enjoy
what
I
have
get
,
and
see
it
increase
daily
upon
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
yet
all
these
thing
,
have
no
effect
upon
me
,
or
at
least
not
enough
to
resist
the
strong
inclination
I
have
to
go
abroad
again
,
which
hang
about
me
like
a
chronical
distemper
;
particularly
the
desire
of
see
my
new
plantation
in
the
island
,
and
the
colony
I
leave
there
,
run
in
my
head
continually
.
<EOS>
I
dream
of
it
all
night
,
and
my
imagination
run
upon
it
all
day
;
it
be
uppermost
in
all
my
thought
,
and
my
fancy
work
so
steadily
and
strongly
upon
it
,
<EOS>
that
I
talk
of
it
in
my
sleep
;
in
short
,
nothing
could
remove
it
out
of
my
mind
;
it
even
break
so
violently
into
all
my
discourse
,
that
it
make
my
conversation
tiresome
;
for
I
could
talk
of
nothing
else
,
all
my
discourse
run
into
it
,
even
to
impertinence
,
and
I
see
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
person
of
good
judgment
say
,
that
all
the
stir
people
make
in
the
world
about
ghost
and
apparition
,
be
owe
to
the
strength
of
imagination
,
and
the
powerful
operation
of
fancy
in
their
mind
;
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
spirit
appear
,
or
a
ghost
walk
,
and
the
like
;
that
people
's
pore
affectionately
upon
the
past
conversation
of
their
deceased
friend
so
realize
it
to
them
,
that
they
be
capable
of
fancy
upon
some
extraordinary
circumstance
that
they
see
them
,
talk
to
them
,
and
be
answer
by
them
,
when
,
in
truth
,
there
be
nothing
but
shadow
and
vapour
in
the
thing
;
and
they
really
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
know
not
to
this
hour
whether
there
be
any
such
thing
as
real
apparition
,
spectre
,
or
walk
of
people
after
they
be
dead
,
or
whether
there
be
any
thing
in
the
story
they
tell
us
of
that
kind
,
more
than
the
product
of
vapour
,
sick
mind
,
and
wander
fancy
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
know
,
that
my
imagination
work
up
to
such
a
height
,
and
bring
me
into
such
excess
of
vapour
,
or
what
else
I
may
call
it
,
that
I
actually
suppose
myself
oftentime
upon
the
spot
,
at
my
old
castle
behind
the
tree
,
see
my
old
Spaniard
,
Friday
's
father
,
and
the
reprobate
sailor
whom
I
leave
upon
the
island
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
fancy
I
talk
with
them
,
and
look
at
them
so
steadily
,
though
I
be
broad
awake
,
as
at
person
just
before
me
;
and
this
I
do
<EOS>
till
I
often
frighten
myself
with
the
image
my
fancy
represent
to
me
:
one
time
in
my
sleep
I
have
the
villany
of
the
three
pirate
sailor
so
lively
related
to
me
,
by
the
first
Spaniard
and
Friday
's
father
,
that
it
be
surprising
;
they
tell
me
how
they
barbarously
attempt
to
murder
all
the
Spaniards
,
and
that
they
set
fire
to
the
provision
they
have
lay
up
,
on
purpose
to
distress
and
starve
them
;
thing
that
I
have
never
hear
of
,
and
that
be
yet
all
of
them
true
in
fact
;
but
it
be
so
warm
in
my
imagination
,
and
so
realize
to
me
,
that
to
the
hour
I
see
them
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
be
persuade
but
that
it
be
or
would
be
true
;
<EOS>
also
how
I
resent
it
when
the
Spaniard
complain
to
me
,
and
how
I
bring
them
to
justice
,
try
them
before
me
,
and
order
them
all
three
to
be
hang
.
<EOS>
what
there
be
really
in
this
,
shall
be
see
in
its
place
;
for
however
I
come
to
form
such
thing
in
my
dream
,
and
what
secret
converse
of
spirit
inject
it
,
yet
there
be
,
I
say
,
very
much
of
it
true
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
that
this
dream
have
nothing
literally
and
specifically
true
;
but
the
general
part
be
so
true
,
the
base
and
villanous
behaviour
of
these
three
harden
rogue
be
such
,
and
have
be
so
much
bad
than
all
I
can
describe
,
that
the
dream
have
too
much
similitude
of
the
fact
;
and
as
I
would
afterwards
have
punish
them
severely
,
so
if
I
have
hang
them
all
,
I
have
be
much
in
the
right
,
and
should
have
be
justifiable
both
by
the
law
of
God
and
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
story
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
kind
of
temper
I
have
live
some
year
,
I
have
no
enjoyment
of
my
life
,
no
pleasant
hour
,
no
agreeable
diversion
<EOS>
but
what
have
something
or
other
of
this
in
it
;
so
that
my
wife
,
who
see
my
mind
so
wholly
bent
upon
it
,
tell
me
very
seriously
one
night
,
that
she
believe
there
be
some
secret
powerful
impulse
of
Providence
upon
me
,
which
have
determine
me
to
go
thither
again
;
and
that
she
find
nothing
hinder
my
going
,
but
my
be
engage
to
a
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
,
that
it
be
true
she
could
not
think
of
part
with
me
;
but
as
she
be
assure
,
that
if
she
be
dead
it
would
be
the
first
thing
I
would
do
;
so
,
as
it
seem
to
her
that
the
thing
be
determine
above
,
she
would
not
be
the
only
obstruction
;
for
if
I
think
fit
,
and
resolve
to
go
 
<EOS>
here
she
find
me
very
intent
upon
her
word
,
and
that
I
look
very
earnestly
at
her
;
so
that
it
a
little
disorder
her
,
and
she
stop
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
why
she
do
not
go
on
,
and
say
out
what
she
be
go
to
say
?
<EOS>
but
I
perceive
her
heart
be
too
full
,
and
some
tear
stand
in
her
eye
:
"
speak
out
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
;
"
be
you
willing
I
should
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
she
,
very
affectionately
,
"
I
be
far
from
willing
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
resolve
to
go
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
rather
than
I
will
be
the
only
hindrance
<EOS>
,
I
will
go
with
you
;
for
though
I
think
it
a
preposterous
thing
for
one
of
your
year
,
and
in
your
condition
,
yet
if
it
must
be
,
"
say
she
again
,
weeping
,
"
I
will
not
leave
you
;
for
if
it
be
of
Heaven
,
you
must
do
it
;
there
be
no
resist
it
;
and
if
Heaven
make
it
your
duty
to
go
,
he
will
also
make
it
mine
to
go
with
you
,
or
otherwise
dispose
of
me
,
that
I
may
not
obstruct
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
affectionate
behaviour
of
my
wife
bring
me
a
little
out
of
the
vapour
,
and
I
begin
to
consider
what
I
be
do
;
I
correct
my
wander
fancy
,
and
begin
to
argue
with
myself
sedately
,
what
business
I
have
,
after
threescore
year
,
and
after
such
a
life
of
tedious
suffering
and
disaster
,
and
close
in
so
happy
and
easy
a
manner
,
I
say
,
what
business
have
I
to
rush
into
new
hazard
,
and
put
myself
upon
adventure
,
fit
only
for
youth
and
poverty
to
run
into
?
  
<EOS>
with
those
thought
,
I
consider
my
new
engagement
;
that
I
have
a
wife
,
one
child
bear
,
and
my
wife
then
great
with
child
of
another
;
that
I
have
all
the
world
could
give
me
and
have
no
need
to
seek
hazard
for
gain
;
that
I
be
decline
in
year
,
and
ought
to
think
rather
of
leave
what
I
have
gain
,
than
of
seek
to
increase
it
;
that
as
to
what
my
wife
have
say
,
of
its
be
an
impulse
from
Heaven
,
and
that
it
should
be
my
duty
to
go
,
I
have
no
notion
of
that
;
so
after
many
of
these
cogitation
,
I
struggle
with
the
power
of
my
imagination
,
reason
myself
out
of
it
,
as
I
believe
people
may
always
do
in
like
case
,
if
they
will
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
conquer
it
;
compose
myself
with
such
argument
as
occur
to
my
thought
,
and
which
my
present
condition
furnish
me
plentifully
with
;
and
particularly
,
as
the
most
effectual
method
,
I
resolve
to
divert
myself
with
other
thing
,
and
to
engage
in
some
business
that
may
effectually
tie
me
up
from
any
more
excursion
of
this
kind
;
for
I
find
the
thing
return
upon
me
chiefly
when
I
be
idle
,
have
nothing
to
do
,
or
any
thing
of
moment
immediately
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
purpose
I
buy
a
little
farm
in
the
county
of
Bedford
,
and
resolve
to
remove
myself
thith
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
convenient
house
upon
it
,
and
the
land
about
it
I
find
be
capable
of
great
improvement
,
and
that
it
be
many
way
suit
to
my
inclination
,
which
delight
in
cultivate
,
manage
,
plant
,
and
improve
of
land
;
and
particularly
,
be
an
inland
country
,
I
be
remove
from
converse
among
ship
,
sailor
,
and
thing
relate
to
the
remote
part
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
go
down
to
my
farm
,
settle
my
family
,
buy
me
plough
,
harrow
,
a
cart
,
waggon
,
horse
,
cow
,
sheep
;
and
set
seriously
to
work
,
become
in
one
half
year
a
mere
country
gentleman
;
my
thought
be
entirely
take
up
in
manage
my
servant
,
cultivate
the
ground
,
enclosing
,
plant
,
&
c.
;
and
I
live
,
as
I
think
,
the
most
agreeable
life
that
nature
be
capable
of
direct
,
or
that
a
man
always
breed
to
misfortune
be
capable
of
be
retreat
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
farm
upon
my
own
land
,
I
have
no
rent
to
pay
,
be
limit
by
no
article
;
I
could
pull
up
or
cut
down
as
I
please
;
what
I
plant
be
for
myself
,
and
what
I
improve
,
be
for
my
family
;
and
have
thus
leave
off
the
thought
of
wander
,
I
have
not
the
least
discomfort
in
any
part
of
my
life
,
as
to
this
world
.
<EOS>
now
I
think
indeed
,
that
I
enjoy
the
middle
state
of
life
which
my
father
so
earnestly
recommend
to
me
,
a
kind
of
heavenly
life
,
something
like
what
be
describe
by
the
poet
upon
the
subject
of
a
country
life
:
       
free
from
vice
,
free
from
care
,
     
Age
have
no
pain
,
and
youth
no
snare
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
the
middle
of
all
this
felicity
,
one
blow
from
unforeseen
Providence
unhinge
me
at
once
;
and
not
only
make
a
breach
upon
me
,
inevitable
and
incurable
,
but
drive
me
,
by
its
consequence
,
upon
a
deep
relapse
into
the
wander
disposition
;
which
,
as
I
may
say
,
be
bear
in
my
very
blood
,
soon
recover
its
hold
of
me
,
and
,
like
the
return
of
a
violent
distemper
,
come
on
with
an
irresistible
force
upon
me
;
so
that
nothing
could
make
any
more
impression
upon
me
.
<EOS>
this
blow
be
the
loss
of
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
business
here
to
write
an
elegy
upon
my
wife
,
to
give
a
character
of
her
particular
virtue
,
and
make
my
court
to
the
sex
by
the
flattery
of
a
funeral
sermon
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
in
a
few
word
,
the
stay
of
all
my
affair
,
the
centre
of
all
my
enterprise
,
the
engine
that
by
her
prudence
reduce
me
to
that
happy
compass
<EOS>
I
be
in
,
from
the
most
extravagant
and
ruinous
project
that
flutter
in
my
head
as
above
;
and
do
more
to
guide
my
rambling
genius
,
than
a
mother
's
tear
,
a
father
's
instruction
,
a
friend
's
counsel
,
or
all
my
own
reasoning
power
could
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
happy
in
listen
to
her
tear
,
and
in
be
move
by
her
entreaty
,
and
to
the
last
degree
desolate
and
dislocate
in
the
world
by
the
loss
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
be
go
the
world
look
awkwardly
round
me
,
I
be
as
much
a
stranger
in
it
in
my
thought
as
I
be
in
the
brasil
when
I
go
first
on
shore
there
;
and
as
much
alone
,
except
as
to
the
assistance
of
servant
,
as
I
be
in
my
island
.
<EOS>
I
know
neither
what
to
do
,
or
what
not
to
do
;
I
see
the
world
busy
round
me
,
one
part
labour
for
bread
,
and
the
other
part
squander
in
vile
excess
or
empty
pleasure
,
equally
miserable
,
because
the
end
they
propose
still
flee
from
them
;
for
the
man
of
pleasure
every
day
surfeit
of
their
vice
,
and
heap
up
work
for
sorrow
and
repentance
,
and
the
man
of
labour
spend
their
strength
in
daily
struggling
for
bread
to
maintain
the
vital
strength
they
labour
with
;
so
live
in
a
daily
circulation
of
sorrow
,
live
but
to
work
,
and
work
but
to
live
,
as
if
daily
bread
be
the
only
end
of
a
wearisome
life
,
and
a
wearisome
life
the
only
occasion
of
daily
bread
.
  
<EOS>
this
put
me
in
mind
of
the
life
I
live
in
my
kingdom
the
island
,
where
I
suffer
no
more
corn
to
grow
,
because
I
do
not
want
it
;
and
breed
no
more
goat
,
because
I
have
no
more
use
for
them
;
where
the
money
lie
in
the
drawer
till
it
grow
mildew
,
and
have
scarce
the
favour
to
be
look
upon
in
twenty
year
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
thing
,
have
I
improve
them
as
I
ought
to
have
do
,
and
as
reason
and
religion
have
dictate
to
me
,
would
have
teach
me
to
search
farther
than
human
enjoyment
for
a
full
felicity
,
and
that
there
be
something
which
certainly
be
the
reason
and
end
of
life
,
superior
to
all
these
thing
,
and
which
be
either
to
be
possess
,
or
at
least
hope
for
,
on
this
side
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
sage
counsellor
be
go
<EOS>
,
I
be
like
a
ship
without
a
pilot
,
that
could
only
run
before
the
wind
;
my
thought
run
all
away
again
into
the
old
affair
,
my
head
be
quite
turn
with
the
whimsy
of
foreign
adventure
;
and
all
the
pleasing
innocent
amusement
of
my
farm
and
my
garden
,
my
cattle
and
my
family
,
which
before
entirely
possess
me
,
be
nothing
to
me
,
have
no
relish
,
and
be
like
music
to
one
that
have
no
ear
,
or
food
to
one
that
have
no
taste
:
in
a
word
,
I
resolve
to
leave
off
housekeeping
,
let
my
farm
,
and
return
to
London
;
and
in
a
few
month
after
I
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
London
<EOS>
I
be
still
as
uneasy
as
before
;
I
have
no
relish
to
the
place
,
no
employment
in
it
,
nothing
to
do
but
to
saunter
about
like
an
idle
person
,
of
whom
it
may
be
say
,
he
be
perfectly
useless
in
God
's
creation
,
and
it
be
not
one
farthe
matter
to
the
rest
of
his
kind
whether
he
be
dead
or
alive
.
<EOS>
this
also
be
the
thing
which
of
all
circumstance
of
life
be
the
most
my
aversion
,
who
have
be
all
my
day
use
to
an
active
life
;
and
I
would
often
say
to
myself
,
"
a
state
of
idleness
be
the
very
dreg
of
life
;
"
and
indeed
I
think
I
be
much
more
suitably
employ
when
I
be
twenty
-
six
day
make
me
a
deal
board
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
beginning
of
the
year
1693
,
when
my
nephew
,
whom
,
as
I
have
observe
before
,
I
have
bring
up
to
the
sea
,
and
have
make
him
commander
of
a
ship
,
be
come
home
from
a
short
voyage
to
Bilboa
,
be
the
first
he
have
make
;
he
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
,
that
some
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
have
be
propose
to
him
to
go
a
voyage
for
them
to
the
East
Indies
and
to
China
,
as
private
trader
;
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
uncle
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
will
go
to
sea
with
me
,
I
will
engage
to
land
you
upon
your
old
habitation
in
the
island
,
for
we
be
to
touch
at
the
Brasils
.
<EOS>
"
  
nothing
can
be
a
great
demonstration
of
a
future
state
,
and
of
the
existence
of
an
invisible
world
,
than
the
concurrence
of
second
cause
with
the
idea
of
thing
which
we
form
in
our
mind
,
perfectly
reserve
,
and
not
communicate
to
any
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
know
nothing
how
far
my
distemper
of
wander
be
return
upon
me
,
and
I
know
nothing
of
what
he
have
in
his
thought
to
say
,
when
that
very
morning
,
before
he
come
to
me
,
I
have
,
in
a
great
deal
of
confusion
of
thought
,
and
revolve
every
part
of
my
circumstance
in
my
mind
,
come
to
this
resolution
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
I
would
go
to
Lisbon
,
and
consult
with
my
old
sea
-
captain
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
if
it
be
rational
and
practicable
,
I
would
go
and
see
the
island
again
,
and
see
what
be
become
of
my
people
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
please
myself
also
with
the
thought
of
people
the
place
,
and
carry
inhabitant
from
hence
,
get
a
patent
for
the
possession
,
and
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
;
when
in
the
middle
of
all
this
,
in
come
my
nephew
,
as
I
have
say
,
with
his
project
of
carry
me
thither
,
in
his
way
to
the
East
Indies
.
  
<EOS>
I
pause
awhile
at
his
word
,
and
look
steadily
at
him
,
"
<EOS>
what
devil
,
"
say
I
,
"
send
you
of
this
unlucky
errand
?
<EOS>
"
My
nephew
startle
,
as
if
he
have
be
fright
at
first
;
but
perceive
I
be
not
much
displeased
with
the
proposal
,
he
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
not
be
an
unlucky
proposal
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
;
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
would
be
pleased
to
see
your
new
colony
there
,
where
you
once
reign
with
more
felicity
than
most
of
your
brother
-
monarchs
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
scheme
hit
so
exactly
with
my
temper
,
that
be
to
say
,
with
the
prepossession
I
be
under
,
and
of
which
I
have
say
so
much
,
that
I
tell
him
,
in
a
few
word
,
if
he
agree
with
the
merchant
I
would
go
with
him
:
but
I
tell
him
I
would
not
promise
to
go
any
farther
than
my
own
island
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
do
not
want
to
be
leave
there
again
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
can
you
not
take
me
up
again
in
your
return
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
it
could
not
be
possible
that
the
merchant
would
allow
him
to
come
that
way
with
a
loaden
ship
of
such
value
,
it
be
a
month
's
sail
out
of
his
way
,
and
may
be
three
or
four
:
<EOS>
"
besides
,
Sir
,
if
I
should
miscarry
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
not
return
at
all
,
then
you
would
be
just
reduce
to
the
condition
you
be
in
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
rational
;
but
we
both
find
out
a
remedy
for
it
,
which
be
to
carry
a
framed
sloop
on
board
the
ship
,
which
,
be
take
in
piece
and
ship
on
board
the
ship
,
may
,
by
the
help
of
some
carpenter
,
whom
we
agree
to
carry
with
us
,
be
set
up
again
in
the
island
,
and
finish
,
fit
to
go
to
sea
in
a
few
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
resolve
;
for
indeed
the
importunity
of
my
nephew
join
in
so
effectually
with
my
inclination
,
that
nothing
could
oppose
me
:
on
the
other
hand
,
my
wife
be
dead
,
I
have
nobody
concern
themselves
so
much
for
me
,
as
to
persuade
me
one
way
or
other
,
except
my
ancient
good
friend
the
widow
,
who
earnestly
struggle
with
me
to
consider
my
year
,
my
easy
circumstance
,
and
the
needless
hazard
of
a
long
voyage
;
and
,
above
all
,
my
young
child
:
but
it
be
all
to
no
purpose
;
I
have
an
irresistible
desire
to
the
voyage
;
and
I
tell
her
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
something
so
uncommon
in
the
impression
I
have
upon
my
mind
for
the
voyage
,
that
it
would
be
a
kind
of
resist
Providence
,
if
I
should
attempt
to
stay
at
home
;
after
which
she
cease
her
expostulation
,
and
join
with
me
,
not
only
in
make
provision
for
my
voyage
,
but
also
in
settle
my
family
affair
in
my
absence
,
and
provide
for
the
education
of
my
child
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
this
I
make
my
will
,
and
settle
the
estate
I
have
in
such
a
manner
for
my
child
,
and
place
in
such
hand
,
that
I
be
perfectly
easy
and
satisfied
they
would
have
justice
do
them
,
whatever
may
befal
me
;
and
for
their
education
,
I
leave
it
wholly
to
my
widow
,
with
a
sufficient
maintenance
to
herself
for
her
care
:
all
which
she
richly
deserve
;
for
no
mother
could
have
take
more
care
in
their
education
,
or
understand
it
better
;
and
as
she
live
till
I
come
home
,
I
also
live
to
thank
her
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
be
ready
to
sail
about
the
beginning
of
January
1694
 
5
,
and
I
with
my
man
Friday
go
on
board
in
the
Downs
the
8th
,
have
,
besides
that
sloop
which
I
mention
above
,
a
very
considerable
cargo
of
all
kind
of
necessary
thing
for
my
colony
,
which
if
I
do
not
find
in
good
condition
,
I
resolve
to
leave
so
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
I
carry
with
me
some
servant
,
whom
I
purpose
to
place
there
as
inhabitant
,
or
at
least
to
set
on
work
there
upon
my
own
account
while
I
stay
,
and
either
to
leave
them
there
,
or
carry
them
forward
,
as
they
should
appear
willing
;
<EOS>
particularly
,
I
carry
two
carpenter
,
a
smith
,
and
a
very
handy
,
ingenious
fellow
,
who
be
a
cooper
by
trade
,
but
be
also
a
general
mechanic
;
for
he
be
dexterous
at
make
wheel
,
and
hand
-
mill
to
grind
corn
,
be
a
good
turner
,
and
a
good
potmaker
;
he
also
make
any
thing
that
be
proper
to
make
of
earth
,
or
of
wood
;
in
a
word
,
we
call
him
our
Jack
of
all
Trades
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
I
carry
a
tailor
,
who
have
offer
himself
to
go
passenger
to
the
East
Indies
with
my
nephew
,
but
afterwards
consent
to
stay
on
our
new
plantation
,
and
prove
a
most
necessary
handy
fellow
as
could
be
desire
,
in
many
other
business
besides
that
of
this
trade
;
for
,
as
I
observe
formerly
,
necessity
arm
us
for
all
employment
.
  
<EOS>
My
cargo
,
as
near
as
I
can
recollect
,
for
I
have
not
keep
an
account
of
the
particular
,
consist
of
a
sufficient
quantity
of
linen
,
and
some
thin
english
stuff
for
clothe
the
Spaniards
that
I
expect
to
find
there
,
and
enough
of
them
as
by
my
calculation
may
comfortably
supply
them
for
seven
year
:
if
I
remember
right
,
the
material
which
I
carry
for
clothe
them
,
with
glove
,
hat
,
shoe
,
stocking
,
and
all
such
thing
as
they
could
want
for
wear
,
amount
to
above
two
hundred
pound
,
include
some
bed
,
bed
,
and
household
-
stuff
,
particularly
kitchen
utensils
,
with
pot
,
kettles
,
pewter
,
brass
,
&
c.
besides
near
a
hundred
pound
more
in
iron
-
work
,
nail
,
tool
of
every
kind
,
staple
,
hook
,
hinge
,
and
every
necessary
thing
I
could
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
carry
also
a
hundred
spare
arm
,
musket
,
and
fuzee
,
besides
some
pistol
,
a
considerable
quantity
of
shot
of
all
size
,
three
or
four
ton
of
lead
,
and
two
piece
of
brass
cannon
;
and
because
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
time
and
what
extremity
I
be
provide
for
,
I
carry
an
hundred
barrel
of
powder
,
besides
sword
,
cutlass
,
and
the
iron
part
of
some
pike
and
halbert
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
we
have
a
large
magazine
of
all
sort
of
store
;
and
I
make
my
nephew
carry
two
small
quarter
-
deck
gun
more
than
he
want
for
his
ship
,
to
leave
behind
if
there
be
occasion
;
that
when
they
come
there
we
may
build
a
fort
,
and
man
it
against
all
sort
of
enemy
:
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
at
first
thought
there
would
be
nee
enough
of
it
all
,
and
much
more
,
if
we
hope
to
maintain
our
possession
of
the
island
,
as
shall
be
see
in
the
course
of
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
such
bad
luck
in
this
voyage
as
I
have
be
use
to
meet
with
;
and
therefore
shall
have
the
less
occasion
to
interrupt
the
reader
,
who
perhaps
may
be
impatient
to
hear
how
matter
go
with
my
colony
;
yet
some
odd
accident
,
cross
wind
,
and
bad
weather
happen
on
this
first
set
out
,
which
make
the
voyage
longer
than
I
expect
it
at
first
;
and
I
,
who
have
never
make
but
one
voyage
,
viz
.
<EOS>
my
first
voyage
to
Guinea
,
in
which
I
may
be
say
to
come
back
again
as
the
voyage
be
at
first
design
,
begin
to
think
the
same
ill
fate
still
attend
me
;
and
that
I
be
bear
to
be
never
content
with
be
on
shore
,
and
yet
to
be
always
unfortunate
at
sea
.
  
<EOS>
contrary
wind
first
put
us
to
the
northward
,
and
we
be
oblige
to
put
in
at
Galway
,
in
Ireland
,
where
we
lay
wind
bind
two
-
and
-
thirty
day
;
but
we
have
this
satisfaction
with
the
disaster
,
that
provision
be
here
,
exceed
cheap
,
and
in
the
utmost
plenty
;
so
that
while
we
lay
here
we
never
touch
the
ship
's
store
,
but
rather
add
to
them
:
<EOS>
here
also
I
take
several
hog
,
and
two
cow
with
their
calf
,
which
I
resolve
,
if
I
have
a
good
passage
,
to
put
on
shore
in
my
island
;
but
we
find
occasion
to
dispose
otherwise
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
the
5th
of
February
from
Ireland
,
and
have
a
very
fair
gale
of
wind
for
some
day
;
as
I
remember
,
it
may
be
about
the
20th
of
February
in
the
evening
late
,
when
the
mate
have
the
watch
,
come
into
the
round
-
house
,
and
tell
us
he
see
a
flash
of
fire
,
and
hear
a
gun
fire
;
and
while
he
be
tell
us
of
it
,
a
boy
come
in
,
and
tell
us
the
boatswain
hear
another
.
<EOS>
this
make
us
all
run
out
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
,
where
for
a
while
we
hear
nothing
,
but
in
a
few
minute
we
see
a
very
great
light
,
and
find
that
there
be
some
very
terrible
fire
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
immediately
we
have
recourse
to
our
reckoning
,
in
which
we
all
agree
that
there
could
be
no
land
that
way
in
which
the
fire
shew
itself
,
no
,
not
for
five
hundred
league
,
for
it
appear
at
W.N.W.
upon
this
we
conclude
it
must
be
some
ship
on
fire
at
sea
;
and
as
by
our
hear
the
noise
of
gun
just
before
,
we
conclude
it
could
not
be
far
off
,
we
stand
directly
towards
it
,
and
be
presently
satisfied
we
should
discover
it
,
because
the
farther
we
sail
the
great
the
light
appear
,
though
the
weather
be
hazy
we
could
not
perceive
any
thing
but
the
light
for
a
while
;
in
about
half
an
hour
's
sailing
,
the
wind
be
fair
for
us
,
though
not
much
of
it
,
and
the
weather
clear
up
a
little
,
we
could
plainly
discern
that
it
be
a
great
ship
on
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
most
sensibly
touch
with
this
disaster
,
though
not
at
all
acquaint
with
the
person
engage
in
it
;
I
presently
recollect
my
former
circumstance
,
in
what
condition
<EOS>
I
be
in
when
take
up
by
the
Portugal
captain
;
and
<EOS>
how
much
more
deplorable
the
circumstance
of
the
poor
creature
belong
to
this
ship
must
be
if
they
have
no
other
ship
in
company
with
them
:
upon
this
I
immediately
order
that
five
gun
should
be
fire
,
one
soon
after
another
,
that
,
if
possible
,
we
may
give
notice
to
them
that
there
be
help
for
them
at
hand
,
and
that
they
may
endeavour
to
save
themselves
in
their
boat
;
for
though
we
could
see
the
flame
in
the
ship
,
yet
<EOS>
they
,
it
be
night
,
could
see
nothing
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
by
some
time
upon
this
,
only
drive
as
the
burn
ship
drive
,
wait
for
daylight
;
when
on
a
sudden
,
to
our
great
terror
,
though
we
have
reason
to
expect
it
,
the
ship
blow
up
in
the
air
,
and
immediately
sink
.
<EOS>
this
be
terrible
,
and
indeed
an
afflict
sight
,
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
man
,
who
,
I
conclude
,
must
be
either
all
destroy
in
the
ship
,
or
be
in
the
utmost
distress
in
their
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
,
which
,
at
present
,
by
reason
it
be
dark
,
I
could
not
see
:
however
,
to
direct
them
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
cause
light
to
be
hang
out
in
all
the
part
of
the
ship
where
we
could
,
and
which
we
have
lantern
for
,
and
keep
fire
gun
all
the
night
long
;
let
them
know
by
this
,
that
there
be
a
ship
not
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
<EOS>
we
discover
the
ship
's
boat
,
by
the
help
of
our
perspective
-
glass
;
and
find
there
be
two
of
them
,
both
throng
with
people
,
and
deep
in
the
water
;
we
perceive
they
row
,
the
wind
be
against
them
;
that
they
see
our
ship
,
and
do
the
utmost
to
make
us
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
immediately
spread
our
ancient
,
to
let
them
know
we
see
them
;
and
hang
a
waft
out
,
as
a
signal
for
them
to
come
on
board
;
and
then
make
more
sail
,
stand
directly
to
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
more
than
half
an
hour
we
come
up
with
them
,
and
in
a
word
take
them
all
in
,
be
no
less
than
sixty
-
four
man
,
woman
,
and
child
;
for
there
be
a
great
many
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
we
find
it
be
a
french
merchant
-
ship
of
three
hundred
ton
,
homeward
-
bind
from
Quebec
,
in
the
river
of
Canada
.
<EOS>
the
master
give
us
a
long
account
of
the
distress
of
his
ship
,
how
the
fire
begin
in
the
steerage
by
the
negligence
of
the
steersman
;
but
,
on
his
cry
out
for
help
,
be
,
as
everybody
think
,
entirely
put
out
:
but
they
soon
find
that
some
spark
of
the
first
fire
have
get
into
some
part
of
the
ship
,
so
difficult
to
come
at
,
that
they
could
not
effectually
quench
it
;
and
afterwards
get
in
between
the
timber
,
and
within
the
ceiling
of
the
ship
,
it
proceed
into
the
hold
,
and
master
all
the
skill
and
all
the
application
they
be
able
to
exert
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
no
more
to
do
then
but
to
get
into
their
boat
,
which
,
to
their
great
comfort
,
be
pretty
large
;
be
their
long
-
boat
,
and
a
great
shallop
,
besides
a
small
skiff
,
which
be
of
no
great
service
to
them
,
other
than
to
get
some
fresh
water
and
provision
into
her
,
after
they
have
secure
themselves
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
have
indeed
small
hope
of
their
life
by
get
into
these
boat
at
that
distance
from
any
land
;
only
,
as
they
say
well
,
that
they
be
escape
from
the
fire
,
and
have
a
possibility
,
that
some
ship
may
happen
to
be
at
sea
,
and
may
take
them
in
.
<EOS>
They
have
sail
,
oar
,
and
a
compass
;
and
be
prepare
to
make
the
good
of
their
way
to
Newfoundland
,
the
wind
blow
pretty
fair
;
for
it
blow
an
easy
gale
at
S.E.
by
E.
<EOS>
They
have
as
much
provision
and
water
,
as
,
with
spare
it
so
as
to
be
next
door
to
starve
,
may
support
them
about
twelve
day
;
in
which
,
if
they
have
no
bad
weather
,
and
no
contrary
wind
,
the
captain
say
,
he
hope
he
may
get
to
the
bank
of
Newfoundland
,
and
may
perhaps
take
some
fish
to
sustain
them
till
they
may
go
on
shore
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
so
many
chance
against
them
in
all
these
case
;
such
as
storm
to
overset
and
founder
them
;
rain
and
cold
to
benumb
and
perish
their
limb
;
contrary
wind
to
keep
them
out
and
starve
them
;
that
it
must
have
be
next
to
miraculous
if
they
have
escape
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
their
consultation
,
every
one
be
hopeless
,
and
ready
to
despair
,
the
captain
with
tear
in
his
eye
tell
me
,
they
be
on
a
sudden
surprised
with
the
joy
of
hear
a
gun
fire
,
and
after
that
four
more
;
these
be
the
five
gun
which
I
cause
to
be
fire
at
first
see
the
light
:
<EOS>
this
revive
their
heart
,
and
give
them
the
notice
which
,
as
above
,
I
design
it
should
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
a
ship
at
hand
for
their
help
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
upon
the
hearing
these
gun
,
that
they
take
down
their
mast
and
sail
;
and
the
sound
come
from
the
windward
,
they
resolve
to
lie
by
till
morning
.
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
hear
no
more
gun
,
they
fire
three
musket
,
one
a
considerable
while
after
another
;
but
these
,
the
wind
be
contrary
,
we
never
hear
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
that
again
,
they
be
still
more
agreeably
surprised
with
see
our
light
,
and
hear
the
gun
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
cause
to
be
fire
all
the
rest
of
the
night
:
this
set
them
to
work
with
their
oar
to
keep
their
boat
ahead
,
at
least
that
we
may
the
sooner
come
up
with
them
;
and
at
last
,
to
their
inexpressible
joy
,
they
find
we
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
several
gesture
,
the
strange
ecstasy
,
the
variety
of
posture
,
which
these
poor
deliver
people
run
into
,
to
express
the
joy
of
their
soul
at
so
unexpected
a
deliverance
;
grief
and
fear
be
easily
describe
;
sigh
,
tear
,
groans
,
and
a
very
few
motion
of
head
and
hand
,
make
up
the
sum
of
its
variety
:
but
an
excess
of
joy
,
a
surprise
of
joy
,
have
a
thousand
extravagance
in
it
;
there
be
some
in
tear
,
some
rage
and
tear
themselves
,
as
if
they
have
be
in
the
great
agony
of
sorrow
;
some
stark
raving
and
downright
lunatic
;
some
run
about
the
ship
stamp
with
their
foot
,
other
wring
their
hand
;
some
be
dance
,
several
singing
,
some
laugh
,
more
cry
;
many
quite
dumb
,
not
able
to
speak
a
word
;
other
sick
and
vomiting
,
several
swooning
,
and
ready
to
faint
;
and
a
few
be
cross
themselves
and
give
God
thank
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
wrong
them
neither
;
there
may
he
many
that
be
thankful
afterward
;
but
the
passion
be
too
strong
for
them
at
first
,
and
they
be
not
able
to
master
it
;
they
be
throw
into
ecstasy
and
a
kind
of
frenzy
,
and
so
there
be
<EOS>
but
a
very
few
who
be
compose
and
serious
in
their
joy
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
also
the
case
may
have
some
addition
to
it
,
from
the
particular
circumstance
of
the
nation
they
belong
to
;
I
mean
the
French
,
whose
temper
be
allow
to
be
more
volatile
,
more
passionate
,
and
more
sprightly
,
and
their
spirit
more
fluid
,
than
of
other
nation
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
philosopher
to
determine
the
cause
,
but
nothing
I
have
ever
see
before
come
up
to
it
:
the
ecstasy
<EOS>
poor
Friday
,
my
trusty
savage
,
be
in
,
when
he
find
his
father
in
the
boat
,
come
the
near
to
it
;
and
the
surprise
of
the
master
,
and
his
two
companion
,
whom
I
deliver
from
the
two
villain
that
set
them
on
shore
in
the
island
,
come
a
little
way
towards
it
;
but
nothing
be
to
compare
to
this
,
either
that
I
see
in
Friday
,
or
any
where
else
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
farther
observable
,
that
these
extravagance
do
not
shew
themselves
in
that
different
manner
I
have
mention
,
in
different
person
only
:
but
all
the
variety
would
appear
in
a
short
succession
of
moment
,
in
one
and
the
same
person
.
<EOS>
a
man
that
we
see
this
minute
dumb
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
stupid
and
confound
,
should
the
next
minute
be
dance
and
halloo
like
an
antic
;
and
the
next
moment
a
-
tear
his
hair
,
or
pull
his
clothe
to
piece
,
and
stamp
them
under
his
foot
like
a
madman
;
a
few
minute
after
that
,
we
should
have
him
all
in
tear
,
then
sick
,
then
swoon
;
and
have
not
immediate
help
be
have
,
would
in
a
few
moment
more
have
be
dead
;
and
thus
it
be
,
not
with
one
or
two
,
or
ten
or
twenty
,
but
with
the
great
part
of
them
;
and
,
if
I
remember
right
,
our
surgeon
be
oblige
to
let
above
thirty
of
them
blood
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
priest
among
them
,
one
an
old
man
,
and
the
other
a
young
man
;
and
that
which
be
strange
be
,
that
the
old
man
be
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
set
his
foot
on
board
our
ship
,
and
see
himself
safe
,
he
drop
down
stone
dead
,
to
all
appearance
;
not
the
least
sign
of
life
could
be
perceive
in
him
;
our
surgeon
immediately
apply
proper
remedy
to
recover
him
;
and
be
the
only
man
in
the
ship
that
believe
he
be
not
dead
:
and
at
length
he
open
a
vein
in
his
arm
,
have
first
chafe
and
rub
the
part
,
so
as
to
warm
it
as
much
as
possible
:
upon
this
the
blood
,
which
only
drop
at
first
,
flow
something
freely
;
in
three
minute
after
the
man
open
his
eye
;
and
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
that
he
speak
,
grow
well
,
and
,
in
a
little
time
,
quite
well
;
after
the
blood
be
stop
he
walk
about
,
tell
us
he
be
perfectly
well
,
take
a
dram
of
cordial
which
the
surgeon
give
him
,
and
be
,
what
we
call
,
come
to
himself
;
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
this
they
come
run
into
the
cabin
to
the
surgeon
,
who
be
bleed
a
french
woman
that
have
faint
,
and
tell
him
the
priest
be
go
stark
mad
.
<EOS>
It
seem
he
have
begin
to
revolve
the
change
of
his
circumstance
in
his
mind
,
and
this
put
him
into
an
ecstasy
of
joy
:
his
spirit
whirl
about
faster
than
the
vessel
could
convey
them
;
the
blood
grow
hot
and
feverish
;
and
the
man
be
as
fit
for
Bedlam
as
any
creature
that
ever
be
in
it
;
the
surgeon
would
not
bleed
him
again
in
that
condition
,
but
give
him
something
to
doze
and
put
him
to
sleep
,
which
,
after
some
time
,
operate
upon
him
,
and
he
wake
next
morning
perfectly
compose
and
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
priest
behave
himself
with
great
command
of
his
passion
,
and
be
really
an
example
of
a
serious
,
well
-
govern
mind
;
at
his
first
come
on
board
the
ship
,
he
throw
himself
flat
on
his
face
,
prostrate
himself
in
thankfulness
for
his
deliverance
;
in
which
I
unhappily
and
unseasonably
disturb
him
,
really
think
he
have
be
in
a
swoon
:
but
he
speak
calmly
;
thank
me
;
tell
me
he
be
give
God
thank
for
his
deliverance
;
beg
me
to
leave
him
a
few
moment
,
and
that
next
to
his
maker
he
would
give
me
thank
also
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
sorry
that
I
disturb
him
,
and
not
only
leave
him
,
but
keep
other
from
interrupt
him
also
;
he
continue
in
that
posture
about
three
minute
,
or
a
little
more
,
after
I
leave
him
,
then
come
to
me
,
as
he
have
say
he
would
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
seriousness
and
affection
,
but
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
thank
me
that
have
,
under
God
,
give
him
and
so
many
miserable
creature
their
life
:
I
tell
him
,
I
have
no
room
to
move
him
to
thank
God
for
it
rather
than
me
;
for
I
have
see
that
he
have
do
that
already
:
<EOS>
but
I
add
,
that
it
be
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
reason
and
humanity
dictate
to
all
man
,
and
that
we
have
as
much
reason
as
he
to
give
thank
to
God
,
who
have
bless
us
so
far
as
to
make
us
the
instrument
of
his
mercy
to
so
many
of
his
creature
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
the
young
priest
apply
himself
to
his
country
-
folk
;
labour
to
compose
them
;
persuade
,
entreat
,
argue
,
reason
with
them
,
and
do
his
utmost
to
keep
them
within
the
exercise
of
their
reason
;
and
with
some
he
have
success
,
though
other
be
,
for
a
time
,
out
of
all
government
of
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
commit
this
to
writing
,
as
perhaps
it
may
be
useful
to
those
into
whose
hand
it
may
fall
,
in
the
guide
themselves
in
all
the
extravagance
of
their
passion
;
for
if
an
excess
of
joy
can
carry
man
out
to
such
a
length
beyond
the
reach
of
their
reason
,
what
will
not
the
extravagance
of
anger
,
rage
,
and
a
provoked
mind
,
carry
us
to
?
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
here
I
see
reason
for
keep
an
exceed
watch
over
our
passion
of
every
kind
,
as
well
those
of
joy
and
satisfaction
,
as
those
of
sorrow
and
anger
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
something
disorder
by
these
extravagance
among
our
new
guest
for
the
first
day
;
but
when
they
have
be
retire
,
lodging
provide
for
them
as
well
as
our
ship
would
allow
,
and
they
have
sleep
heartily
,
as
most
of
them
do
,
be
fatigue
and
frightened
,
they
be
quite
another
sort
of
people
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
of
good
manner
,
or
civil
acknowledgment
for
the
kindness
show
them
,
be
want
;
the
French
,
it
be
know
,
be
naturally
apt
enough
to
exceed
that
way
.
<EOS>
the
captain
and
one
of
the
priest
come
to
me
the
next
day
;
and
,
desire
to
speak
with
me
and
my
nephew
,
the
commander
,
begin
to
consult
with
us
what
should
be
do
with
them
;
and
first
they
tell
us
,
that
as
we
have
save
their
life
,
so
all
they
have
be
little
enough
for
a
return
to
us
for
the
kindness
receive
.
<EOS>
the
captain
say
,
they
have
save
some
money
,
and
some
thing
of
value
in
their
boat
,
catch
hastily
out
of
the
flame
:
and
if
we
would
accept
it
,
they
be
order
to
make
an
offer
of
it
all
to
us
;
they
only
desire
to
be
set
on
shore
somewhere
in
our
way
,
where
,
if
possible
,
they
may
get
a
passage
to
France
.
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
be
for
accept
their
money
at
first
word
,
and
to
consider
what
to
do
with
them
afterwards
;
but
I
overrule
him
in
that
part
;
for
I
know
what
it
be
to
be
set
on
shore
in
a
strange
country
;
and
if
the
Portugal
captain
that
take
me
up
at
sea
have
serve
me
so
,
and
take
all
I
have
for
my
deliverance
,
I
must
have
starve
,
or
have
be
as
much
a
slave
at
the
Brasils
as
I
have
be
at
Barbary
,
the
be
sell
to
a
Mahometan
only
except
;
and
perhaps
a
Portuguese
be
not
a
much
well
master
than
a
Turk
,
if
not
,
in
some
case
,
a
much
bad
.
  
<EOS>
I
therefore
tell
the
french
captain
that
we
have
take
them
up
in
their
distress
,
it
be
true
;
but
that
it
be
our
duty
to
do
so
,
as
we
be
fellow
-
creature
,
and
as
we
would
desire
to
be
so
deliver
,
if
we
be
in
the
like
or
any
other
extremity
;
that
we
have
do
nothing
for
them
but
what
we
believe
they
would
have
do
for
us
if
we
have
be
in
their
case
and
they
in
ours
;
but
that
we
take
them
up
to
serve
them
,
not
to
plunder
them
;
and
that
it
would
be
a
most
barbarous
thing
,
to
take
that
little
from
them
which
they
have
save
out
of
the
fire
,
and
then
set
them
on
shore
and
leave
them
;
that
this
would
be
first
to
save
them
from
death
and
then
kill
them
ourselves
;
save
them
from
drown
and
then
abandon
them
to
starve
;
and
therefore
I
would
not
let
the
least
thing
be
take
from
them
:
<EOS>
as
to
set
them
on
shore
,
I
tell
them
indeed
that
be
an
exceed
difficulty
to
us
,
for
that
the
ship
be
bind
to
the
East
Indies
;
and
though
we
be
drive
out
of
our
course
to
the
westward
a
very
great
way
,
which
perhaps
be
direct
by
Heaven
on
purpose
for
their
deliverance
,
yet
it
be
impossible
for
us
wilfully
to
change
our
voyage
on
this
particular
account
;
nor
could
my
nephew
,
the
captain
,
answer
it
to
the
freighter
,
with
whom
he
be
under
charter
-
party
to
pursue
his
voyage
by
the
way
of
Brasil
;
and
all
I
know
he
could
do
for
them
be
,
to
put
ourselves
in
the
way
of
meeting
with
other
ship
homeward
-
bind
from
the
West
Indies
,
and
get
them
passage
,
if
possible
,
to
England
or
France
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
part
of
the
proposal
be
so
generous
and
kind
,
they
could
not
but
be
very
thankful
for
it
;
but
they
be
in
a
great
consternation
,
especially
the
passenger
,
at
the
notion
of
be
carry
away
to
the
East
Indies
<EOS>
:
they
then
entreat
me
,
that
see
I
be
drive
so
far
to
the
westward
before
I
meet
with
them
,
I
would
at
least
keep
on
the
same
course
to
the
bank
of
Newfoundland
,
where
it
be
possible
I
may
meet
some
ship
or
sloop
that
they
may
hire
to
carry
them
back
to
Canada
,
from
whence
they
come
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
this
be
but
a
reasonable
request
on
their
part
,
and
therefore
I
incline
to
agree
to
it
<EOS>
;
for
indeed
I
consider
,
that
to
carry
this
whole
company
to
the
East
Indies
would
not
only
be
an
intolerable
severity
to
the
poor
people
,
but
would
be
ruin
our
voyage
by
devour
all
our
provision
;
so
I
think
it
no
breach
of
charter
-
party
,
but
what
an
unforeseen
accident
make
absolutely
necessary
to
us
;
and
in
which
no
one
could
say
we
be
to
blame
;
for
the
law
of
God
and
nature
would
have
forbid
,
that
we
should
refuse
to
take
up
two
boat
full
of
people
in
such
a
distressed
condition
;
and
the
nature
of
the
thing
,
as
well
respect
ourselves
as
the
poor
people
,
oblige
us
to
see
them
on
shore
somewhere
or
other
,
for
their
deliverance
;
so
I
consent
that
we
would
carry
them
to
Newfoundland
,
if
wind
and
weather
would
permit
;
and
,
if
not
,
that
I
would
carry
them
to
Martinico
in
the
West
Indies
.
  
<EOS>
the
wind
continue
fresh
easterly
,
but
the
weather
pretty
good
;
and
as
it
have
blow
continually
in
the
point
between
N.E.
and
S.E.
a
long
time
,
we
miss
several
opportunity
of
send
them
to
France
;
for
we
meet
several
ship
bind
to
Europe
,
whereof
two
be
French
,
from
St.
Christopher
's
;
but
they
have
be
so
long
beat
up
against
the
wind
,
that
they
durst
take
in
no
passenger
for
fear
of
want
provision
for
the
voyage
,
as
well
for
themselves
as
for
those
they
should
take
in
;
so
we
be
oblige
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
a
week
after
this
,
that
we
make
the
bank
of
Newfoundland
,
where
,
to
shorten
my
story
,
we
put
all
our
french
people
on
board
a
bark
,
which
they
hire
at
sea
there
,
to
put
them
on
shore
,
and
afterwards
to
carry
them
to
France
,
if
they
could
get
provision
to
victual
themselves
with
:
<EOS>
when
,
I
say
,
all
the
French
go
on
shore
,
I
should
remember
that
the
young
priest
I
speak
of
,
hear
we
be
bind
to
the
East
Indies
,
desire
to
go
the
voyage
with
us
,
and
to
be
set
on
shore
on
the
coast
of
Coromandel
<EOS>
:
I
readily
agree
to
that
;
for
I
wonderfully
like
the
man
,
and
have
very
good
reason
,
as
will
appear
afterwards
;
also
four
of
the
seaman
enter
themselves
in
our
ship
,
and
prove
very
useful
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
we
direct
our
course
for
the
West
Indies
,
steer
away
S.
and
S.
by
E.
for
about
twenty
day
together
,
sometimes
little
or
no
wind
at
all
,
when
we
meet
with
another
subject
for
our
humanity
to
work
upon
,
almost
as
deplorable
as
that
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
latitude
of
27
degree
5
minute
N.
and
the
19th
day
of
March
1684
 
5
,
when
we
espy
a
sail
,
our
course
S.E.
and
by
S.
<EOS>
We
soon
perceive
it
be
a
large
vessel
,
and
that
she
bear
up
to
us
;
but
could
not
at
first
know
what
to
make
of
her
,
till
,
after
come
a
little
nearer
,
we
find
she
have
lose
her
main
-
topmast
,
fore
-
mast
,
and
bowsprit
;
and
presently
she
fire
a
gun
as
a
signal
of
distress
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
pretty
good
,
wind
at
N.N.W.
<EOS>
a
fresh
gale
,
and
we
soon
come
to
speak
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
her
a
ship
of
Bristol
bind
home
from
barbadoe
,
but
have
be
blow
out
of
the
road
at
Barbadoes
,
a
few
day
before
she
be
ready
to
sail
,
by
a
terrible
hurricane
,
while
the
captain
and
chief
mate
be
both
go
on
shore
;
so
that
beside
the
terror
of
the
storm
,
they
be
but
in
an
indifferent
case
for
good
artist
to
bring
the
ship
home
;
they
have
be
already
nine
week
at
sea
,
and
have
meet
with
another
terrible
storm
after
the
hurricane
be
over
,
which
have
blow
them
quite
out
of
their
knowledge
to
the
westward
,
and
in
which
they
have
lose
their
mast
,
as
above
;
they
tell
us
,
they
expect
to
have
see
the
Bahama
Islands
,
but
be
then
drive
away
again
to
the
south
-
east
by
a
strong
gale
of
wind
at
N.N.W.
the
same
that
blow
now
,
and
have
no
sail
to
work
the
ship
with
,
but
a
main
-
course
,
and
a
kind
of
square
sail
upon
a
jury
-
foremast
,
which
they
have
set
up
,
they
could
not
lie
near
the
wind
,
but
be
endeavour
to
stand
away
for
the
canary
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
be
bad
of
all
,
be
,
that
they
be
almost
starve
for
want
of
provision
,
besides
the
fatigue
they
have
undergo
;
<EOS>
their
bread
and
flesh
be
quite
go
,
they
have
not
an
ounce
leave
in
the
ship
,
and
have
have
none
for
eleven
day
;
the
only
relief
they
have
,
be
,
their
water
be
not
all
spend
,
and
they
have
about
half
a
barrel
of
flour
leave
;
they
have
sugar
enough
;
some
succade
or
sweetmeat
they
have
at
first
,
but
they
be
devour
;
and
they
have
seven
cask
of
rum
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
youth
and
his
mother
,
and
a
maid
-
servant
,
on
board
,
who
be
go
passenger
,
and
think
the
ship
be
ready
to
sail
,
unhappily
come
on
board
the
evening
before
the
hurricane
begin
;
and
have
no
provision
of
their
own
left
,
they
be
in
a
more
deplorable
condition
than
the
rest
;
for
the
seaman
,
be
reduce
to
such
an
extreme
necessity
themselves
,
have
no
compassion
,
we
may
be
sure
,
for
the
poor
passenger
;
and
they
be
indeed
in
a
condition
that
their
misery
be
very
hard
to
describe
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
perhaps
not
know
this
part
,
if
my
curiosity
have
not
lead
me
,
the
weather
be
fair
,
and
the
wind
abate
,
to
go
on
board
the
ship
:
<EOS>
the
second
mate
,
who
upon
this
occasion
command
the
ship
,
have
be
on
board
our
ship
;
and
he
tell
me
indeed
,
that
they
have
three
passenger
in
the
great
cabin
,
that
they
be
in
a
deplorable
condition
;
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
believe
they
be
dead
,
for
I
have
hear
nothing
of
them
for
above
two
day
;
and
I
be
afraid
to
inquire
after
them
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
I
have
nothing
to
relieve
them
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
immediately
apply
ourselves
to
give
them
what
relief
we
could
spare
;
and
indeed
I
have
so
far
overrule
thing
with
my
nephew
,
that
I
would
have
victual
them
,
though
we
have
go
away
to
Virginia
,
or
any
part
of
the
coast
of
America
,
to
have
supply
ourselves
;
but
there
be
no
necessity
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
they
be
in
a
new
danger
,
for
they
be
afraid
of
eat
too
much
,
even
of
that
little
we
give
them
.
<EOS>
the
mate
or
commander
bring
six
man
with
him
in
his
boat
,
but
these
poor
wretch
look
like
skeleton
,
and
be
so
weak
they
could
hardly
sit
to
their
oar
;
the
mate
himself
be
very
ill
,
and
half
-
starve
,
for
he
declare
he
have
reserve
nothing
from
the
man
,
and
go
share
and
share
alike
with
them
in
every
bit
they
eat
.
  
<EOS>
I
caution
him
to
eat
sparingly
,
but
set
meat
before
him
immediately
,
and
he
have
not
eat
three
mouthful
before
he
begin
to
be
sick
,
and
out
of
order
;
so
he
stop
awhile
,
and
our
surgeon
mix
him
up
something
with
some
broth
,
which
he
say
would
be
to
him
both
food
and
physic
;
and
after
he
have
take
it
,
he
grow
better
:
in
the
meantime
I
forget
not
the
man
;
I
order
victual
to
be
give
them
,
and
the
poor
creature
rather
devour
than
eat
it
;
they
be
so
exceed
hungry
,
that
they
be
in
a
manner
ravenous
,
and
have
no
command
of
themselves
;
and
two
of
them
eat
with
so
much
greediness
,
that
they
be
in
danger
of
their
life
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
sight
of
these
people
's
distress
be
very
move
to
me
,
and
bring
to
mind
what
I
have
a
terrible
respect
of
at
my
first
come
on
shore
in
my
island
,
where
I
have
not
the
least
mouthful
of
food
,
or
any
hope
of
procure
it
;
besides
the
hourly
apprehension
I
have
of
be
make
the
food
of
other
creature
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
while
the
mate
be
thus
relate
to
me
the
miserable
condition
of
the
ship
's
company
,
I
could
not
put
out
of
my
thought
the
story
he
have
tell
me
of
the
three
poor
creature
in
the
great
cabin
;
viz
.
<EOS>
the
mother
,
her
son
,
and
the
maid
-
servant
,
whom
he
have
hear
nothing
of
for
two
or
three
day
;
and
whom
he
seem
to
confess
they
have
wholly
neglect
,
their
own
extremity
be
so
great
;
by
which
I
understand
that
they
have
really
give
them
no
food
at
all
;
and
that
therefore
they
must
be
perish
,
and
be
all
lie
dead
perhaps
on
the
floor
or
deck
of
the
cabin
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
therefore
keep
the
mate
,
whom
we
then
call
captain
,
on
board
with
his
man
to
refresh
them
,
so
I
also
forget
not
the
starve
crew
that
be
leave
on
board
,
but
order
my
own
boat
to
go
on
board
the
ship
and
with
my
mate
and
twelve
man
to
carry
them
a
sack
of
bread
,
and
four
or
five
piece
of
beef
to
boil
.
<EOS>
Our
surgeon
charge
the
man
to
cause
the
meat
to
be
boil
while
they
stay
,
and
to
keep
guard
in
the
cook
-
room
,
to
prevent
the
man
's
take
it
to
eat
raw
,
or
take
it
out
of
the
pot
before
it
be
well
boil
,
and
then
to
give
every
man
but
a
little
at
a
time
;
and
by
this
caution
he
preserve
the
man
,
who
would
otherwise
have
kill
themselves
with
that
very
food
that
be
give
them
on
purpose
to
save
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
order
the
mate
to
go
into
the
great
cabin
,
and
see
what
condition
the
poor
passenger
be
in
,
and
,
if
they
be
alive
,
to
comfort
them
and
give
them
what
refreshment
be
proper
;
and
the
surgeon
give
him
a
large
pitcher
with
some
of
the
prepared
broth
which
he
have
give
the
mate
that
be
on
board
,
and
which
he
do
not
question
would
restore
them
gradually
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
satisfied
with
this
;
but
,
as
I
say
above
,
have
a
great
mind
to
see
the
scene
of
misery
,
which
I
know
the
ship
itself
would
present
me
with
,
in
a
more
lively
manner
than
I
could
have
it
by
report
<EOS>
,
I
take
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
as
we
now
call
him
,
with
me
,
and
go
myself
a
little
after
in
their
boat
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
the
poor
man
on
board
almost
in
a
tumult
to
get
the
victual
out
of
the
boiler
before
it
be
ready
;
but
my
mate
observe
his
order
,
and
keep
a
good
guard
at
the
cook
-
room
door
;
and
the
man
he
place
there
,
after
use
all
possible
persuasion
to
have
patience
,
keep
them
off
by
force
<EOS>
:
however
,
he
cause
some
biscuit
cake
to
be
dip
in
the
pot
,
and
soften
them
with
the
liquor
of
the
meat
,
which
they
call
brewis
,
and
give
every
one
one
,
to
stay
their
stomach
,
and
tell
them
it
be
for
their
own
safety
that
he
be
oblige
to
give
them
but
little
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
in
vain
,
and
have
I
not
come
on
board
,
and
their
own
commander
and
officer
with
me
,
and
with
good
word
,
and
some
threat
also
of
give
them
no
more
,
I
believe
they
would
have
break
into
the
cook
-
room
by
force
,
and
tear
the
meat
out
of
the
furnace
;
for
word
indeed
be
of
a
very
small
force
to
an
hungry
belly
:
however
,
we
pacify
them
,
and
feed
them
gradually
and
cautiously
for
the
first
time
,
and
the
next
time
give
them
more
,
and
at
last
fill
their
belly
,
and
the
man
do
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
misery
of
the
poor
passenger
in
the
cabin
be
of
another
nature
,
and
far
beyond
the
rest
;
for
as
,
first
,
the
ship
's
company
have
so
little
for
themselves
<EOS>
,
it
be
but
too
true
,
that
they
have
at
first
keep
them
very
low
,
and
at
last
totally
neglect
them
;
so
that
for
six
or
seven
day
,
it
may
be
say
,
they
have
really
have
no
food
at
all
,
and
for
several
day
before
,
very
little
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
mother
,
who
,
as
the
first
mate
report
,
be
a
woman
of
good
sense
and
good
breeding
,
have
spare
all
she
could
get
so
affectionately
for
her
son
,
that
at
last
she
entirely
sink
under
it
;
and
when
the
mate
of
our
ship
go
in
,
she
sit
upon
the
floor
or
deck
,
with
her
back
up
against
the
side
,
between
two
chair
,
which
be
lash
fast
,
and
her
head
sink
in
between
her
shoulder
,
like
a
corpse
,
though
not
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
My
mate
say
all
he
could
to
revive
and
encourage
her
,
and
with
a
spoon
put
some
broth
into
her
mouth
;
she
open
her
lip
,
and
lift
up
one
hand
,
but
could
not
speak
:
yet
she
understand
what
he
say
,
and
make
sign
to
him
,
intimate
,
that
it
be
too
late
for
her
;
but
point
to
her
child
,
as
if
she
would
have
say
,
they
should
take
care
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
mate
,
who
be
exceedingly
move
with
the
sight
,
endeavour
to
get
some
of
the
broth
into
her
mouth
;
and
,
as
he
say
,
get
two
or
three
spoonful
down
,
though
I
question
whether
he
could
be
sure
of
it
or
not
;
but
it
be
too
late
,
and
she
die
the
same
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
youth
,
who
be
preserve
at
the
price
of
his
most
affectionate
mother
's
life
,
be
not
so
far
go
;
yet
he
lie
in
a
cabin
-
bed
as
one
stretch
out
,
with
hardly
any
life
leave
in
him
;
he
have
a
piece
of
an
old
glove
in
his
mouth
,
have
eat
up
the
rest
of
it
;
however
,
be
young
,
and
have
more
strength
than
his
mother
<EOS>
,
the
mate
get
something
down
his
throat
,
and
he
begin
sensibly
to
revive
,
though
,
by
give
him
some
time
after
but
two
or
three
spoonful
extraordinary
,
he
be
very
sick
,
and
bring
it
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
next
care
be
the
poor
maid
;
she
lie
all
along
upon
the
deck
hard
by
her
mistress
,
and
just
like
one
that
have
fall
down
with
an
apoplexy
,
and
struggle
for
life
:
her
limb
be
distort
,
one
of
her
hand
be
clasp
round
the
frame
of
one
chair
,
and
she
gripe
it
so
hard
,
that
we
could
not
easily
make
her
let
it
go
;
her
other
arm
lie
over
her
head
,
and
her
foot
lie
both
together
,
set
fast
against
the
frame
of
the
cabin
-
table
;
in
short
,
she
lie
just
like
one
in
the
last
agony
of
death
;
and
yet
she
be
alive
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
be
not
only
starve
with
hunger
,
and
terrify
with
the
thought
of
death
,
but
,
as
the
man
tell
us
afterwards
,
be
break
-
hearted
for
her
mistress
,
whom
she
see
die
two
or
three
day
before
,
and
whom
she
love
most
tenderly
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
not
what
to
do
with
this
poor
girl
;
for
when
our
surgeon
,
who
be
a
man
of
very
great
knowledge
and
experience
,
and
with
great
application
recover
her
as
to
life
,
he
have
her
upon
his
hand
as
to
her
sense
,
for
she
be
little
less
than
distract
for
a
considerable
time
after
;
as
shall
appear
presently
.
  
<EOS>
whoever
shall
read
these
memorandum
,
must
be
desire
to
consider
,
that
visit
at
sea
be
not
like
a
journey
into
the
country
,
where
sometimes
people
stay
a
week
or
a
fortnight
at
a
place
.
<EOS>
Our
business
be
to
relieve
this
distressed
ship
's
crew
,
but
not
lie
by
for
them
;
and
though
they
be
willing
to
steer
the
same
course
with
us
for
some
day
,
yet
we
could
carry
no
sail
to
keep
pace
with
a
ship
that
have
no
mast
:
however
,
as
their
captain
beg
of
us
to
help
him
to
set
up
a
main
-
topmast
,
and
a
kind
of
topmast
to
his
jury
-
foremast
,
we
do
,
as
it
be
,
lie
by
him
for
three
or
four
day
,
and
then
have
give
him
five
barrel
of
beef
and
pork
,
two
hogshead
of
biscuit
,
and
a
proportion
of
pea
,
flour
,
and
what
other
thing
we
could
spare
;
and
take
three
cask
of
sugar
and
some
rum
,
and
some
piece
of
eight
of
them
for
satisfaction
<EOS>
,
we
leave
them
,
take
on
board
with
us
,
at
their
own
earnest
request
,
the
youth
and
the
maid
,
and
all
their
good
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lad
be
about
seventeen
year
of
age
,
a
pretty
,
well
-
breed
,
modest
,
and
sensible
youth
;
greatly
deject
with
the
loss
of
his
mother
,
and
,
as
it
happen
have
lose
his
father
bit
a
few
month
before
at
Barbados
.
<EOS>
He
beg
of
the
surgeon
to
speak
to
me
,
to
take
him
out
of
the
ship
;
for
he
say
,
the
cruel
fellow
have
murder
his
mother
;
and
indeed
so
they
have
,
that
be
to
say
,
passively
;
for
they
may
have
spare
a
small
sustenance
to
the
poor
helpless
widow
,
that
may
have
preserve
her
life
,
though
it
have
be
just
to
keep
her
alive
.
<EOS>
but
hunger
know
no
friend
,
no
relation
,
no
justice
,
no
right
;
and
therefore
be
remorseless
,
and
capable
of
no
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
the
surgeon
tell
him
how
far
we
be
go
,
and
how
it
would
carry
him
away
from
all
his
friend
,
and
put
him
perhaps
in
as
bad
circumstance
,
almost
,
as
we
find
them
in
;
that
be
to
say
,
starve
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
matter
not
whither
he
go
,
if
he
be
but
deliver
from
the
terrible
crew
that
he
be
among
:
that
the
captain
(
by
which
he
mean
me
,
for
he
could
know
nothing
of
my
nephew
)
<EOS>
have
save
his
life
,
and
he
be
sure
would
not
hurt
him
;
and
as
for
the
maid
,
he
be
sure
,
if
she
come
to
herself
,
she
would
he
very
thankful
for
it
,
let
us
carry
them
whither
we
would
.
<EOS>
the
surgeon
represent
the
case
so
affectionately
to
me
,
that
I
yield
,
and
we
take
them
both
on
board
with
all
their
good
,
except
eleven
hogshead
of
sugar
,
which
could
not
be
remove
,
or
come
at
;
and
as
the
youth
have
a
bill
of
lade
for
them
,
I
make
his
commander
sign
a
writing
,
oblige
him
to
go
,
as
soon
as
he
come
to
Bristol
,
to
one
Mr.
Rogers
,
a
merchant
there
,
to
whom
the
youth
say
he
be
relate
,
and
to
deliver
a
letter
which
I
write
to
him
,
and
all
the
good
he
have
belong
to
the
deceased
widow
;
which
I
suppose
be
not
do
;
for
I
could
never
learn
that
the
ship
come
to
Bristol
;
but
be
,
as
be
most
probable
,
lose
at
sea
,
be
in
so
disabled
a
condition
,
and
so
far
from
any
land
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
of
opinion
,
the
first
storm
she
meet
with
afterwards
she
may
founder
in
the
sea
;
for
she
be
leaky
,
and
have
damage
in
her
hold
when
I
meet
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
the
latitude
of
19
deg
.
<EOS>
32
min
.
<EOS>
and
have
hitherto
have
a
tolerable
voyage
as
to
weather
,
though
at
first
the
wind
have
be
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
shall
trouble
nobody
with
the
little
incident
of
wind
,
weather
,
current
,
&
c.
on
the
rest
of
our
voyage
;
but
,
shorten
my
story
for
the
sake
of
what
be
to
follow
<EOS>
,
shall
observe
,
that
I
come
to
my
old
habitation
,
the
island
,
on
the
10th
of
April
,
1695
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
no
small
difficulty
that
I
find
the
place
;
for
as
I
come
to
it
,
and
go
from
it
before
,
on
the
south
and
east
side
of
the
island
,
as
come
from
the
Brasils
;
so
now
come
in
between
the
main
and
the
island
,
and
have
no
chart
for
the
coast
,
nor
any
land
-
mark
,
I
do
not
know
it
when
I
see
it
,
or
know
whether
I
see
it
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
We
beat
about
a
great
while
,
and
go
on
shore
on
several
island
in
the
mouth
of
the
great
river
Oroonoque
,
but
none
for
my
purpose
:
only
this
I
learn
by
my
coast
the
shore
,
that
I
be
under
one
great
mistake
before
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
continent
which
I
think
I
see
from
the
island
I
live
in
,
be
really
no
continent
,
but
a
long
island
,
or
rather
a
ridge
of
island
reach
from
one
to
the
other
side
of
the
extended
mouth
of
that
great
river
;
and
that
the
savage
who
come
to
my
island
,
be
not
properly
those
which
we
call
caribbee
,
but
islander
,
and
other
barbarian
of
the
same
kind
,
who
inhabit
something
near
to
our
side
than
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
visit
several
of
the
island
to
no
purpose
;
some
I
find
be
inhabit
,
and
some
be
not
.
<EOS>
on
one
of
them
I
find
some
Spaniards
,
and
think
they
have
live
there
;
but
speak
with
them
,
find
they
have
a
sloop
lie
in
a
small
creek
hard
by
,
and
that
they
come
thither
to
make
salt
,
and
catch
some
pearl
-
muscle
,
if
they
could
;
but
they
belong
to
the
Isle
de
Trinidad
,
which
lie
farther
north
,
in
the
latitude
of
10
and
11
degree
.
  
<EOS>
thus
coast
from
one
island
to
another
,
sometimes
with
the
ship
,
sometimes
with
the
Frenchman
's
shallop
(
which
we
have
find
a
convenient
boat
,
and
therefore
keep
her
with
their
very
good
will
,
)
at
length
<EOS>
I
come
fair
on
the
south
side
of
my
island
,
and
I
presently
know
the
very
countenance
of
the
place
;
so
I
bring
the
ship
safe
to
an
anchor
broadside
with
the
little
creek
where
be
my
old
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
see
the
place
,
I
call
for
Friday
,
and
ask
him
,
if
he
know
where
he
be
?
<EOS>
He
look
about
a
little
,
and
presently
clap
his
hand
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
o
yes
,
<EOS>
o
there
,
o
yes
,
o
there
!
"
<EOS>
point
to
our
old
habitation
,
and
fall
a
-
dancing
and
caper
like
a
mad
fellow
;
and
I
have
much
ado
to
keep
him
from
jump
into
the
sea
,
to
swim
ashore
to
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Friday
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
we
shall
find
any
body
here
,
or
no
?
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
,
shall
we
see
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fellow
stand
mute
as
a
stock
a
good
while
;
but
when
I
name
his
father
,
the
poor
affectionate
creature
look
dejected
;
and
I
could
see
the
tear
run
down
his
face
very
plentifully
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
Friday
?
"
say
I
;
"
be
you
troubled
because
you
may
see
your
father
"
 
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
shake
his
head
,
"
<EOS>
no
see
him
more
,
no
ever
more
see
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
,
"
say
I
,
"
Friday
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
no
,
o
no
,
"
say
Friday
,
"
he
long
ago
die
;
long
ago
,
he
much
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
Friday
,
you
do
not
know
;
but
shall
we
see
any
one
else
then
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
it
seem
,
have
well
eye
than
I
,
and
he
point
just
to
the
hill
above
my
old
house
;
and
though
we
lay
half
a
league
off
,
he
cry
out
,
"
Me
see
!
<EOS>
me
see
!
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
me
see
much
man
there
,
and
there
,
and
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
look
,
but
I
could
see
nobody
,
no
,
not
with
a
perspective
-
glass
;
which
be
,
I
suppose
,
because
I
could
not
hit
the
place
;
for
the
fellow
be
right
,
as
I
find
upon
inquiry
the
next
day
,
and
there
be
five
or
six
man
all
together
stand
to
look
at
the
ship
,
not
know
what
to
think
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Friday
have
tell
me
he
see
people
,
I
cause
the
english
ancient
to
be
spread
,
and
fire
three
gun
,
to
give
them
notice
we
be
friend
;
and
about
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
,
we
perceive
a
smoke
rise
from
the
side
of
the
creek
;
so
I
immediately
order
a
boat
out
,
take
Friday
with
me
;
and
hang
out
a
white
flag
,
or
a
flag
of
truce
,
I
go
directly
on
shore
,
take
with
me
the
young
friar
I
mention
,
to
whom
I
have
tell
the
whole
story
of
live
there
,
and
the
manner
of
it
,
and
every
particular
both
of
myself
and
those
that
I
leave
there
,
and
who
be
on
that
account
extremely
desirous
to
go
with
me
,
We
have
besides
about
sixteen
man
very
well
armed
,
if
we
have
find
any
new
guest
there
which
we
do
not
know
of
;
but
we
have
no
need
of
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
go
on
shore
upon
the
tide
of
flood
near
high
water
,
we
row
directly
into
the
creek
;
and
the
first
man
I
fix
my
eye
upon
be
the
Spaniard
whose
life
I
have
save
,
and
whom
I
know
by
his
face
perfectly
well
;
as
to
his
habit
,
I
shall
describe
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
order
nobody
to
go
on
shore
at
first
but
myself
;
but
there
be
no
keeping
Friday
in
the
boat
;
for
the
affectionate
creature
have
spy
his
father
at
a
distance
,
a
good
way
off
of
the
Spaniards
,
where
indeed
I
see
nothing
of
him
;
and
if
they
have
not
let
him
go
on
shore
he
would
have
jump
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
on
shore
,
but
he
fly
away
to
his
father
like
an
arrow
out
of
a
bow
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
make
any
man
shed
tear
in
spite
of
the
firm
resolution
to
have
see
the
first
transport
of
this
poor
fellow
's
joy
,
when
he
come
to
his
father
;
how
he
embrace
him
,
kiss
him
,
stroke
his
face
,
take
him
in
his
arm
,
set
him
down
upon
a
tree
,
and
lie
down
by
him
;
then
stand
and
look
at
him
as
any
one
would
look
at
a
strange
picture
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
;
then
lie
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
stroke
his
leg
,
and
kiss
them
,
and
then
get
up
again
,
and
stare
at
him
;
one
would
have
think
the
fellow
bewitched
:
but
it
would
have
make
a
dog
laugh
to
see
how
the
next
day
his
passion
run
out
another
way
:
in
the
morning
he
walk
along
the
shore
to
and
again
,
with
his
father
,
several
hour
,
always
lead
him
by
the
hand
as
if
he
have
be
a
lady
and
every
now
and
then
would
come
to
fetch
something
or
other
for
him
from
the
boat
,
either
a
lump
of
sugar
,
or
a
dram
,
a
biscuit
,
or
something
or
other
that
be
good
.
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
his
frolic
run
another
way
;
for
then
he
would
set
the
old
man
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
dance
about
him
,
and
make
a
thousand
antic
posture
and
gesture
;
and
all
the
while
he
do
this
be
would
be
talk
to
him
,
and
tell
him
one
story
or
another
of
his
travel
,
and
of
what
have
happen
to
him
abroad
,
to
divert
him
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
if
the
same
filial
affection
be
to
be
find
in
Christians
to
their
parent
in
our
part
of
the
world
,
one
would
be
tempt
to
say
there
hardly
would
have
be
any
need
of
the
fifth
commandment
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
digression
;
I
return
to
my
landing
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
endless
to
take
notice
of
all
the
ceremony
and
civility
that
the
Spaniards
receive
me
with
.
<EOS>
the
first
Spaniard
whom
,
as
I
say
,
I
know
very
well
,
be
he
<EOS>
whose
life
I
save
;
he
come
towards
the
boat
attend
by
one
more
,
carry
a
flag
of
truce
also
;
and
he
do
not
only
not
know
me
at
first
,
but
he
have
no
thought
,
no
notion
,
of
its
be
me
that
be
come
til
I
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Seignior
,
"
say
I
,
in
Portuguese
,
"
do
you
not
know
me
?
"
<EOS>
at
which
he
speak
not
a
word
;
but
give
his
musket
to
the
,
man
that
be
with
him
,
throw
his
arm
abroad
,
and
say
something
in
Spanish
that
I
do
not
perfectly
hear
,
come
forward
,
and
embrace
me
,
tell
me
,
he
be
inexcusable
not
to
know
that
face
again
that
he
have
once
see
,
as
of
an
angel
from
Heaven
send
to
save
his
life
:
he
say
abundance
of
very
handsome
thing
,
as
a
well
-
breed
Spaniard
always
know
how
:
and
then
beckon
to
the
person
that
attend
him
,
bade
him
go
and
call
out
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
if
I
would
walk
to
my
old
habitation
,
where
he
would
give
me
possession
of
my
own
house
again
,
and
where
I
should
see
there
,
have
be
<EOS>
but
mean
improvement
;
so
I
walk
along
with
him
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
I
could
no
more
find
the
place
again
than
if
I
have
never
be
there
;
for
they
have
plant
so
many
tree
,
and
place
them
in
such
a
posture
,
so
thick
and
close
to
one
another
,
in
ten
year
time
they
be
grow
so
big
,
that
,
in
short
,
the
place
be
inaccessible
,
except
by
such
winding
and
blind
way
as
they
themselves
only
who
make
them
could
find
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
them
,
what
put
them
upon
all
these
fortification
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
I
would
say
there
be
need
enough
of
it
,
when
they
have
give
an
account
how
they
have
pass
their
time
since
their
arriving
in
the
island
,
especially
after
they
have
the
misfortune
to
find
that
I
be
go
<EOS>
:
he
tell
me
he
could
not
but
have
some
satisfaction
in
my
good
fortune
,
when
he
hear
that
I
be
go
in
a
good
ship
,
and
to
my
satisfaction
;
and
that
he
have
oftentime
a
strong
persuasion
that
one
time
or
other
he
should
see
me
again
:
<EOS>
but
nothing
that
ever
befel
him
in
his
life
,
he
say
,
be
so
surprising
and
afflict
to
him
at
first
,
as
the
disappointment
he
be
under
when
he
come
back
to
the
island
,
and
find
I
be
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
three
barbarian
(
so
he
call
them
)
<EOS>
that
be
leave
behind
,
and
of
whom
he
say
he
have
a
long
story
to
tell
me
;
the
Spaniards
all
think
themselves
much
better
among
the
savage
,
only
that
their
number
be
so
small
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
"
say
he
,
"
have
they
be
strong
enough
<EOS>
,
we
have
be
all
long
ago
in
purgatory
and
with
that
he
cross
himself
upon
the
breast
.
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
,
when
I
shall
tell
you
how
,
force
by
necessity
,
we
be
oblige
,
for
our
own
preservation
,
to
disarm
them
,
and
make
them
our
subject
,
who
would
not
be
content
with
be
moderately
our
master
,
but
would
be
our
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
I
be
heartily
afraid
of
it
when
I
leave
them
there
;
and
nothing
trouble
me
at
my
parting
from
the
island
,
but
that
they
be
not
come
back
,
that
I
may
have
put
them
in
possession
of
every
thing
first
,
and
leave
the
other
in
a
state
of
subjection
,
as
they
deserve
;
but
if
they
have
reduce
them
to
it
,
I
be
very
glad
,
and
should
be
very
far
from
find
any
fault
with
it
;
for
I
know
they
be
a
parcel
of
refractory
,
ungovernable
villain
,
and
be
fit
for
any
manner
of
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
say
this
come
the
man
whom
he
have
send
back
,
and
with
him
eleven
man
more
:
in
the
dress
they
be
in
,
it
be
impossible
to
guess
what
nation
they
be
of
;
but
he
make
all
clear
both
to
them
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
first
he
turn
to
me
,
and
point
to
them
,
say
,
"
these
,
Sir
,
be
some
of
the
gentleman
who
owe
their
life
to
you
;
"
and
then
turn
to
them
,
and
point
to
me
,
he
let
them
know
who
I
be
;
upon
which
they
all
come
up
one
by
one
,
not
as
if
they
have
be
sailor
,
and
ordinary
fellow
,
and
I
the
like
,
but
really
as
if
they
have
be
ambassador
or
nobleman
,
and
I
a
monarch
or
a
great
conqueror
:
their
behaviour
be
to
the
last
degree
obliging
and
courteous
,
and
yet
mix
with
a
manly
majestic
gravity
,
which
very
well
become
them
;
and
,
in
short
,
they
have
so
much
more
manner
than
I
,
that
I
scarce
know
how
to
receive
their
civility
,
much
less
how
to
return
them
in
kind
.
  
<EOS>
the
history
of
their
come
to
,
and
conduct
in
the
island
after
my
go
away
,
be
so
remarkable
,
and
have
so
many
incident
,
which
the
former
part
of
my
relation
will
help
to
understand
,
and
which
will
,
in
most
of
the
particular
,
refer
to
that
account
I
have
already
give
,
that
I
can
not
but
commit
them
with
great
delight
to
the
reading
of
those
that
come
after
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
no
longer
trouble
the
story
with
a
relation
in
the
first
person
,
which
will
put
me
to
the
expense
of
ten
thousand
<EOS>
say
I
be
,
and
say
he
be
,
and
He
tell
me
's
,
and
I
tell
him
's
,
and
the
like
;
but
I
shall
collect
the
fact
historically
as
near
as
I
can
gather
them
out
of
my
memory
from
what
they
relate
to
me
,
and
from
what
I
meet
with
in
my
conversing
with
them
,
and
with
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
do
this
succinctly
,
and
as
intelligibly
as
I
can
,
I
must
go
back
to
the
circumstance
in
which
I
leave
the
island
,
and
which
the
person
be
in
of
whom
I
be
to
speak
.
<EOS>
at
first
it
be
necessary
to
repeat
,
that
I
have
send
away
Friday
's
father
and
the
Spaniard
,
the
two
whose
life
I
have
rescue
from
the
savage
;
I
say
,
I
have
send
them
away
in
a
large
canoe
to
the
main
,
as
I
then
think
it
,
to
fetch
over
the
Spaniard
's
companion
whom
he
have
leave
behind
him
,
in
order
to
save
them
from
the
like
calamity
that
he
have
be
in
,
and
in
order
to
succour
them
for
the
present
,
and
that
,
if
possible
,
we
may
together
find
some
way
for
our
deliverance
afterward
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
send
them
away
,
I
have
no
visible
appearance
of
,
or
the
least
room
to
hope
for
,
my
own
deliverance
,
any
more
than
I
have
twenty
year
before
;
much
less
have
I
any
foreknowledge
of
what
after
happen
,
I
mean
of
an
english
ship
come
on
shore
there
to
fetch
them
off
;
and
it
could
not
but
be
a
very
great
surprise
to
them
when
they
come
back
,
not
only
to
find
that
I
be
go
,
but
to
find
three
stranger
leave
on
the
spot
,
possess
of
all
that
I
have
leave
behind
me
,
which
would
otherwise
have
be
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
,
however
,
which
I
inquire
into
,
that
I
may
begin
where
I
leave
off
,
be
of
their
own
part
;
and
I
desire
he
would
give
me
a
particular
account
of
his
voyage
back
to
his
countryman
with
the
boat
,
when
I
send
him
to
fetch
them
over
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
there
be
little
variety
in
that
part
;
for
nothing
remarkable
happen
to
them
on
the
way
,
they
have
very
calm
weather
and
a
smooth
sea
;
for
his
countryman
it
could
not
be
doubt
,
he
say
,
but
that
they
be
overjoy
to
see
him
<EOS>
(
it
seem
he
be
the
principal
man
among
them
,
the
captain
of
the
vessel
they
have
be
shipwreck
in
have
be
dead
some
time
:
)
<EOS>
they
be
,
he
say
,
the
more
surprised
to
see
him
,
because
they
know
that
he
be
fall
into
the
hand
of
savage
,
who
,
they
be
satisfied
,
would
devour
him
,
as
they
do
all
the
rest
of
their
prisoner
;
that
when
he
tell
them
the
story
of
the
deliverance
,
and
in
what
manner
he
be
furnish
for
carry
them
away
,
it
be
like
a
dream
to
them
;
and
their
astonishment
,
they
say
,
be
something
like
that
of
Joseph
's
brother
,
when
he
tell
them
who
he
be
,
and
tell
them
the
story
of
his
exaltation
in
Pharaoh
's
court
;
but
<EOS>
when
he
shew
them
the
arm
,
the
powder
,
the
ball
,
and
the
provision
that
he
bring
them
for
their
journey
or
voyage
,
they
be
restore
to
themselves
,
take
a
just
share
of
the
joy
of
their
deliverance
,
and
immediately
prepare
to
come
away
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Their
first
business
be
to
get
canoe
;
and
in
this
they
be
oblige
not
to
stick
so
much
upon
the
honest
part
of
it
,
but
to
trespass
upon
their
friendly
savage
,
and
to
borrow
two
large
canoe
or
periaguas
,
on
pretence
of
go
out
a
-
fishing
,
or
for
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
they
come
away
the
next
morning
;
it
seem
they
want
no
time
to
get
themselves
ready
,
for
they
have
no
baggage
,
neither
clothe
,
or
provision
,
or
any
thing
in
the
world
,
but
what
they
have
on
them
,
and
a
few
root
to
eat
,
of
which
they
use
to
make
their
bread
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
in
all
three
week
absent
,
and
in
that
time
,
unluckily
for
them
,
I
have
the
occasion
offer
for
my
escape
,
as
I
mention
in
my
other
part
,
and
to
get
off
from
the
island
;
leave
three
of
the
most
impudent
,
harden
,
ungoverned
,
disagreeable
villain
behind
me
that
any
man
could
desire
to
meet
with
,
to
the
poor
Spaniards
'
great
grief
and
disappointment
you
may
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
just
thing
the
rogue
do
,
be
,
that
when
the
Spaniards
come
on
shore
,
they
give
my
letter
to
them
,
and
give
them
provision
and
other
relief
,
as
I
have
order
them
to
do
;
also
they
give
them
the
long
paper
of
direction
,
which
I
have
leave
with
them
,
contain
the
particular
method
which
I
take
for
manage
every
part
of
my
life
there
;
the
way
how
I
bake
my
bread
,
breed
up
my
tame
goat
,
and
plant
my
corn
<EOS>
;
how
I
cure
my
grape
,
make
my
pot
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
every
thing
I
do
;
all
this
be
write
down
,
they
give
to
the
Spaniards
,
two
of
whom
understand
English
well
enough
;
nor
do
they
refuse
to
accommodate
the
Spaniards
with
any
thing
else
,
for
they
agree
very
well
for
some
time
;
they
give
them
an
equal
admission
into
the
house
,
or
cave
,
and
they
begin
to
live
very
sociably
;
and
the
head
Spaniard
,
who
have
see
pretty
much
of
my
method
,
and
Friday
's
father
together
,
manage
all
their
affair
;
for
as
for
the
Englishmen
,
they
do
nothing
but
ramble
about
the
island
,
shoot
parrot
,
and
catch
tortoise
,
and
when
they
come
home
at
night
,
the
Spaniards
provide
their
supper
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
would
have
be
satisfied
with
this
<EOS>
would
the
other
but
have
leave
them
alone
;
which
however
,
they
could
not
find
in
their
heart
to
do
long
;
but
,
like
the
dog
in
the
manger
,
they
would
not
eat
themselves
,
and
would
not
let
other
eat
neither
:
the
difference
,
nevertheless
,
be
at
first
but
trivial
and
such
as
be
not
worth
relate
:
but
at
last
it
break
out
into
open
war
,
and
it
begin
with
all
the
rudeness
and
insolence
that
can
be
imagine
,
without
reason
,
without
provocation
,
contrary
to
nature
,
and
indeed
to
common
sense
;
and
though
,
it
be
true
,
the
first
relation
of
it
come
from
the
Spaniards
themselves
,
whom
I
may
call
the
accuser
,
yet
when
I
come
to
examine
the
fellow
,
they
could
not
deny
a
word
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
I
come
to
the
particular
of
this
part
,
I
must
supply
a
defect
in
my
former
relation
;
and
this
be
,
that
I
forget
to
set
down
among
the
rest
,
that
just
as
we
be
weigh
the
anchor
to
set
sail
,
there
happen
a
little
quarrel
on
board
our
ship
,
which
I
be
afraid
once
would
turn
to
a
second
mutiny
;
nor
be
it
appeased
till
the
captain
,
rouse
up
his
courage
,
and
take
us
all
to
his
assistance
,
part
them
by
force
,
and
make
two
of
the
most
refractory
fellow
prisoner
,
he
lay
them
in
iron
;
and
as
they
have
be
active
in
the
former
disorder
,
and
let
fall
some
ugly
dangerous
word
the
second
time
,
he
threaten
to
carry
them
in
iron
to
England
,
and
have
them
hang
there
for
mutiny
,
and
run
away
with
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
it
seem
,
though
the
captain
do
not
intend
to
do
it
,
fright
some
other
man
in
the
ship
;
and
some
of
them
have
put
it
in
the
head
of
the
rest
,
that
the
captain
only
give
them
good
word
for
the
present
till
they
should
come
to
some
english
port
,
and
that
then
they
should
be
all
put
into
a
gaol
,
and
try
for
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
mate
get
intelligence
of
this
,
and
acquaint
us
with
it
;
upon
which
it
be
desire
that
I
,
who
still
pass
for
a
great
man
among
them
,
should
go
down
with
the
mate
and
satisfy
the
man
,
and
tell
them
,
that
they
may
be
assure
,
if
they
behave
well
the
rest
of
the
voyage
,
all
they
have
do
for
the
time
past
should
be
pardon
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
,
and
after
pass
my
honour
's
word
to
them
they
appear
easy
,
and
the
more
so
,
when
I
cause
the
two
man
who
be
in
iron
to
be
release
and
forgive
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
mutiny
have
bring
us
to
an
anchor
for
that
night
,
the
wind
also
fall
calm
.
<EOS>
next
morning
we
find
that
our
two
man
who
have
be
lay
in
iron
,
have
steal
each
of
them
a
musket
and
some
other
weapon
;
what
powder
or
shoot
they
have
we
know
not
;
and
have
take
the
ship
's
pinnace
,
which
be
not
yet
hale
up
,
and
run
away
with
her
to
their
companion
in
roguery
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
find
this
,
I
order
the
long
-
boat
on
shore
,
with
twelve
man
and
the
mate
,
and
away
they
go
to
seek
the
rogue
;
but
they
could
neither
find
them
,
nor
any
of
the
rest
;
for
they
all
flee
into
the
wood
when
they
see
the
boat
come
on
shore
.
<EOS>
the
mate
be
once
resolve
,
in
justice
to
their
roguery
,
to
have
destroy
their
plantation
,
burn
all
their
household
stuff
and
furniture
,
and
leave
them
to
shift
without
it
;
but
have
no
order
,
he
let
all
alone
,
leave
every
thing
as
they
find
it
,
and
bring
the
pinnace
away
,
come
on
board
without
them
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
man
make
their
number
five
:
but
the
other
three
villain
be
so
much
wicked
than
these
,
that
after
they
have
be
two
or
three
day
together
,
they
turn
their
two
new
-
comer
out
of
door
to
shift
for
themselves
,
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
;
nor
could
they
,
for
a
good
while
,
be
persuade
to
give
them
any
food
:
as
for
the
Spaniards
,
they
be
not
yet
come
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Spaniards
come
first
on
shore
,
the
business
begin
to
go
forward
;
the
Spaniards
would
have
persuade
the
three
english
brute
to
have
take
in
their
two
countryman
again
,
that
,
as
they
say
,
they
may
be
all
one
family
;
but
they
would
not
hear
of
it
:
so
the
two
poor
fellow
live
by
themselves
,
and
find
nothing
but
industry
and
application
would
make
them
live
comfortable
,
they
pitch
their
tent
on
the
north
shore
of
the
island
,
but
a
little
more
to
the
west
,
to
be
out
of
the
danger
of
the
savage
,
who
always
land
on
the
east
part
of
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
build
two
hut
,
one
to
lodge
in
,
and
the
other
to
lay
up
their
magazine
and
store
in
;
and
the
Spaniards
have
give
them
some
corn
for
seed
,
and
especially
some
of
the
pea
which
I
have
leave
them
,
they
dig
and
plant
,
and
enclose
,
after
the
pattern
I
have
set
for
them
all
,
and
begin
to
live
pretty
well
;
their
first
crop
of
corn
be
on
the
ground
,
and
though
it
be
but
a
little
bit
of
land
which
they
have
dig
up
at
first
,
have
have
but
<EOS>
a
little
time
,
yet
it
be
enough
to
relieve
them
,
and
find
them
with
bread
or
other
eatable
;
and
one
of
the
fellow
,
be
the
cook
's
mate
of
the
ship
,
be
very
ready
at
make
soup
,
pudding
,
and
such
other
preparation
,
as
the
rice
and
the
milk
,
and
such
little
flesh
as
they
get
,
furnish
him
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
go
on
in
a
little
thriving
posture
,
when
the
three
unnatural
rogue
,
their
own
countryman
too
,
in
mere
humour
,
and
to
insult
them
,
come
and
bully
them
,
and
tell
them
the
island
be
theirs
;
that
the
governor
,
mean
me
,
have
give
them
possession
of
it
,
and
nobody
else
have
any
right
to
it
;
and
,
damn
them
,
they
should
build
no
house
upon
their
ground
,
unless
they
would
pay
them
rent
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
think
they
have
jest
at
first
,
and
ask
them
to
come
and
sit
down
,
and
see
what
fine
house
they
be
that
they
have
build
,
and
tell
them
what
rent
they
demand
:
and
one
of
them
merrily
tell
them
,
if
they
be
ground
-
landlord
,
he
hope
if
they
build
tenement
upon
the
land
and
make
improvement
,
they
would
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
all
landlord
,
grant
them
a
long
lease
;
and
bid
them
go
fetch
a
scrivener
to
draw
the
writing
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
three
,
damn
and
rage
,
tell
them
they
should
see
they
be
not
in
jest
;
and
go
to
a
little
place
at
a
distance
,
where
the
honest
man
have
make
a
fire
to
dress
their
victual
,
he
take
a
firebrand
and
clap
it
to
the
outside
of
their
hut
,
and
very
fairly
set
it
on
fire
;
and
it
would
have
be
all
burn
down
in
a
few
minute
,
if
one
of
the
two
have
not
run
to
the
fellow
,
thrust
him
away
,
and
tread
the
fire
out
with
his
foot
,
and
that
not
without
some
difficulty
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
in
such
a
rage
at
the
honest
man
's
thrust
him
away
,
that
he
turn
upon
him
with
a
pole
he
have
in
his
hand
;
and
have
not
the
man
avoid
the
blow
very
nimbly
,
and
run
into
the
hut
,
he
have
end
his
day
at
once
.
<EOS>
His
comrade
,
see
the
danger
they
be
both
in
,
run
in
after
him
,
and
immediately
they
come
both
out
with
their
musket
;
and
the
man
that
be
first
strike
at
with
the
pole
knock
the
fellow
down
who
begin
the
quarrel
with
the
stock
of
his
musket
,
and
that
before
the
other
two
could
come
to
help
him
;
and
then
see
the
rest
come
at
them
,
they
stand
together
,
and
present
the
other
end
of
their
piece
to
them
,
bade
them
stand
off
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
have
fire
-
arm
with
them
too
;
but
one
of
the
two
honest
man
,
bold
than
his
comrade
,
and
make
desperate
by
his
danger
,
tell
them
if
they
offer
to
move
hand
or
foot
they
be
all
dead
man
,
and
boldly
command
them
to
lay
down
their
arm
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
indeed
lay
down
their
arm
;
but
see
him
resolute
,
it
bring
them
to
a
parley
,
and
they
consent
to
take
their
wounded
man
with
them
,
and
be
go
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
seem
the
fellow
be
wound
sufficiently
with
the
blow
:
however
,
they
be
much
in
the
wrong
,
since
they
have
the
advantage
,
that
they
do
not
disarm
them
effectually
,
as
they
may
have
do
,
and
have
go
immediately
to
the
Spaniards
,
and
give
them
an
account
how
the
rogue
treat
them
;
for
the
three
villain
study
nothing
but
revenge
,
and
every
day
give
them
some
intimation
that
they
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
to
crowd
this
part
with
an
account
of
the
less
part
of
their
roguery
,
such
as
tread
down
their
corn
,
shoot
three
young
kid
and
a
she
-
goat
,
which
the
poor
man
have
get
to
breed
up
tame
for
their
store
;
and
in
a
word
,
plague
them
night
and
day
in
this
manner
,
it
force
the
two
man
to
such
a
desperation
,
that
they
resolve
to
fight
them
all
three
the
first
time
they
have
a
fair
opportunity
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
this
they
resolve
to
go
to
the
castle
,
as
they
call
it
,
that
be
my
old
dwelling
,
where
the
three
rogue
and
the
Spaniards
all
live
together
at
that
time
,
intend
to
have
a
fair
battle
,
and
the
Spaniards
should
stand
by
to
see
fair
play
.
<EOS>
so
they
get
up
in
the
morning
before
day
,
and
come
to
the
place
,
and
call
the
englishman
by
their
name
,
tell
a
Spaniard
that
answer
,
that
they
want
to
speak
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
the
day
before
two
of
the
Spaniards
,
have
be
in
the
wood
,
have
see
one
of
the
two
Englishmen
,
whom
,
for
distinction
,
I
call
the
honest
man
;
and
he
have
make
a
sad
complaint
to
the
Spaniards
,
of
the
barbarous
usage
they
have
meet
with
from
their
three
countryman
,
and
how
they
have
ruin
their
plantation
,
and
destroy
their
corn
,
that
they
have
labour
so
hard
to
bring
forward
,
and
kill
the
milch
-
goat
,
and
their
three
kid
,
which
be
all
they
have
provide
for
their
sustenance
;
and
that
if
he
and
his
friend
,
mean
the
Spaniards
,
do
not
assist
them
again
,
they
should
be
starve
.
<EOS>
when
the
Spaniards
come
home
at
night
,
and
they
be
all
at
supper
,
he
take
the
freedom
to
reprove
the
three
Englishmen
,
though
in
gentle
and
mannerly
term
,
and
ask
them
,
how
they
could
be
so
cruel
,
they
be
harmless
inoffensive
fellow
,
and
that
they
be
put
themselves
in
a
way
to
subsist
by
their
labour
,
and
that
it
have
cost
them
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
bring
thing
to
such
perfection
as
they
have
?
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
Englishmen
return
very
briskly
,
"
what
have
they
to
do
there
?
<EOS>
that
they
come
on
shore
without
leave
,
and
that
they
should
not
plant
or
build
upon
the
island
;
it
be
none
of
their
ground
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
very
calmly
,
"
Seignior
Inglese
,
they
must
not
starve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Englishman
reply
,
like
a
true
rough
-
hew
tarpaulin
,
"
they
may
starve
and
be
d
 
<EOS>
ed
,
they
should
not
plant
nor
build
in
that
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
must
they
do
then
,
Seignior
?
"
say
the
Spaniard

<EOS>
another
of
the
brute
return
,
"
do
!
<EOS>
d####n
them
,
they
should
be
servant
,
and
work
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
can
you
expect
that
of
them
?
<EOS>
They
be
not
buy
with
your
money
;
you
have
no
right
to
make
them
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Englishman
answer
,
"
the
island
be
theirs
,
the
governor
have
give
it
to
them
,
and
no
man
have
any
thing
to
do
there
but
themselves
;
"
and
with
that
swore
by
his
Maker
,
that
he
would
go
and
burn
all
their
new
hut
;
they
should
build
none
upon
their
land
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Seignior
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
"
by
the
same
rule
,
we
must
be
your
servant
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
the
bold
dog
,
"
and
<EOS>
so
you
shall
too
,
before
we
have
do
with
you
;
"
mix
two
or
three
<EOS>
G####d
d
 
<EOS>
mme
be
in
the
proper
interval
of
his
speech
.
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
only
smile
at
that
,
and
make
him
no
answer
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
little
discourse
have
heat
them
;
and
start
up
,
one
say
to
the
other
,
I
think
it
be
he
they
call
Will
Atkins
,
"
come
,
Jack
,
let
us
go
and
have
the
other
brush
with
them
;
we
will
demolish
their
castle
,
I
will
warrant
you
;
they
shall
plant
no
colony
in
our
dominion
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
they
be
all
troop
away
,
with
every
man
a
gun
,
a
pistol
,
and
a
sword
,
and
mutter
some
insolent
thing
among
themselves
,
of
what
they
would
do
to
the
Spaniards
too
,
when
opportunity
offer
;
but
the
Spaniards
,
it
seem
,
do
not
so
perfectly
understand
them
as
to
know
all
the
particular
;
only
that
,
in
general
,
they
threaten
them
hard
for
take
the
two
englishman
's
part
.
  
<EOS>
Whither
they
go
,
or
how
they
bestow
their
time
that
evening
<EOS>
,
the
Spaniards
say
they
do
not
know
;
but
it
seem
they
wander
about
the
country
part
of
the
night
;
and
then
lie
down
in
the
place
which
I
use
to
call
my
bower
,
they
be
weary
,
and
overslept
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
this
:
they
have
resolve
to
stay
till
midnight
,
and
so
to
take
the
poor
man
when
they
be
asleep
;
and
they
acknowledge
it
afterwards
,
intend
to
set
fire
to
their
hut
while
they
be
in
them
,
and
either
burn
them
in
them
,
or
murder
them
as
they
come
out
:
and
,
as
malice
seldom
sleep
very
sound
<EOS>
,
it
be
very
strange
<EOS>
they
should
not
have
be
keep
wake
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
two
man
have
also
a
design
upon
them
,
as
I
have
say
,
though
a
much
fair
one
than
that
of
burn
and
murder
,
it
happen
,
and
very
luckily
for
them
all
,
that
they
be
up
,
and
go
abroad
,
before
the
bloody
-
minded
rogue
come
to
their
hut
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
thither
,
and
find
the
man
go
,
Atkins
,
who
it
seem
be
the
forward
man
,
call
out
to
his
comrade
,
"
ha
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
here
be
the
nest
;
but
d####n
them
,
the
bird
be
fly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
muse
awhile
to
think
what
should
be
the
occasion
of
their
be
go
abroad
so
soon
,
and
suggest
presently
,
that
the
Spaniards
have
give
them
notice
of
it
;
and
with
that
they
shake
hand
,
and
swear
to
one
another
,
that
they
would
be
revenge
of
the
Spaniards
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
have
make
this
bloody
bargain
,
they
fall
to
work
with
the
poor
man
's
habitation
;
they
do
not
set
fire
indeed
to
any
thing
,
but
they
pull
down
both
their
house
,
and
pull
them
so
limb
from
limb
,
that
they
leave
not
the
least
stick
standing
,
or
scarce
any
sign
on
the
ground
where
they
stand
;
they
tear
all
their
little
collect
household
-
stuff
in
piece
,
and
throw
every
thing
about
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
poor
man
find
,
afterwards
,
some
of
their
thing
a
mile
off
from
their
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
do
this
,
they
pull
up
all
the
young
tree
which
the
poor
man
have
plant
;
pull
up
the
enclosure
they
have
make
to
secure
their
cattle
and
their
corn
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
sack
and
plunder
every
thing
,
as
completely
as
a
herd
of
tartar
would
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
at
this
juncture
go
to
find
them
out
,
and
have
resolve
to
fight
them
wherever
they
have
be
,
though
they
be
but
two
to
three
;
so
that
,
have
they
meet
,
there
certainly
would
have
be
bloodshe
among
them
;
for
they
be
all
very
stout
,
resolute
fellow
,
to
give
them
their
due
.
  
<EOS>
but
Providence
take
more
care
to
keep
them
asunder
,
than
they
themselves
could
do
to
meet
;
for
,
as
they
have
dog
one
another
,
when
the
three
be
go
thith
,
the
two
be
here
;
and
afterwards
,
when
the
two
go
back
to
find
them
,
the
three
be
come
to
the
old
habitation
again
:
<EOS>
we
shall
see
their
differing
conduct
presently
.
<EOS>
when
the
three
come
back
,
like
furious
creature
,
flush
with
the
rage
which
the
work
they
have
be
about
put
them
into
,
they
come
up
to
the
Spaniards
,
and
tell
them
what
they
have
do
,
by
way
of
scoff
and
bravado
;
and
one
of
them
step
up
to
one
of
the
Spaniards
,
as
if
they
have
be
a
couple
of
boy
at
play
,
take
hold
of
his
hat
,
as
it
be
upon
his
head
,
and
give
it
a
twirl
about
,
jeer
in
his
face
,
say
he
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
and
you
,
Seignior
Jack
Spaniard
,
shall
have
the
same
sauce
,
if
you
do
not
mend
your
manner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
,
who
,
though
quite
a
civil
man
,
be
as
brave
as
a
man
could
desire
to
be
,
and
withal
a
strong
well
-
make
man
,
look
steadily
at
him
for
a
good
while
;
and
then
,
have
no
weapon
in
his
hand
,
step
gravely
up
to
him
,
and
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
knock
him
down
,
as
an
ox
be
fell
with
a
pole
-
axe
;
at
which
one
of
the
rogue
,
insolent
as
the
first
,
fix
his
pistol
at
the
Spaniard
immediately
;
he
miss
his
body
indeed
,
for
the
bullet
go
through
his
hair
,
but
one
of
them
touch
the
tip
of
his
ear
,
and
he
bleed
pretty
much
.
<EOS>
the
blood
make
the
Spaniard
believe
he
be
more
hurt
than
he
really
be
,
and
that
put
him
into
some
heat
,
for
before
he
act
all
in
a
perfect
calm
;
but
now
resolve
to
go
through
with
his
work
,
he
stoop
and
take
the
fellow
's
musket
whom
he
have
knock
down
,
and
be
just
go
to
shoot
the
man
who
have
fire
at
him
;
when
the
rest
of
the
Spaniards
,
be
in
the
cave
,
come
out
,
and
call
to
him
not
to
shoot
,
they
step
in
,
secure
the
other
two
,
and
take
their
arm
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
thus
disarm
,
and
find
they
have
make
all
the
Spaniards
their
enemy
,
as
well
as
their
own
countryman
,
they
begin
to
cool
;
and
give
the
Spaniards
well
word
,
would
have
have
their
arm
again
;
but
the
Spaniards
,
consider
the
feud
that
be
between
them
and
the
other
two
englishman
,
and
that
it
would
be
the
good
method
they
could
take
to
keep
them
from
one
another
,
tell
them
they
would
do
them
no
harm
;
and
if
they
would
live
peaceably
they
would
be
very
willing
to
assist
and
associate
with
them
,
as
they
do
before
;
but
that
they
could
not
think
of
give
them
their
arm
again
,
while
they
appear
so
resolve
to
do
mischief
with
them
to
their
own
countryman
,
and
have
even
threaten
them
all
to
make
them
their
servant
.
  
<EOS>
the
rogue
be
now
more
capable
to
hear
reason
than
to
act
reason
;
but
be
refuse
their
arm
,
they
go
rave
away
,
and
rage
like
madman
,
threaten
what
they
would
do
,
though
they
have
no
fire
-
arm
:
but
the
Spaniards
,
despise
their
threatening
,
tell
them
they
should
take
care
how
they
offer
any
injury
to
their
plantation
or
cattle
;
for
if
they
do
,
they
would
shoot
them
,
as
they
would
do
ravenous
beast
,
wherever
they
find
them
;
and
if
they
fall
into
their
hand
alive
,
they
would
certainly
be
hang
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
far
from
cool
them
;
but
away
they
go
,
swear
and
rage
like
fury
of
hell
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
go
,
come
back
the
two
man
in
passion
and
rage
enough
also
,
though
of
another
kind
;
for
,
have
be
at
their
plantation
,
and
find
it
all
demolish
and
destroy
,
as
above
,
it
will
easily
be
suppose
they
have
provocation
enough
;
they
could
scarce
have
room
to
tell
their
tale
,
the
Spaniards
be
so
eager
to
tell
them
theirs
;
and
it
be
strange
enough
to
find
,
that
three
man
should
thus
bully
nineteen
,
and
receive
no
punishment
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
indeed
despise
them
,
and
especially
have
thus
disarm
them
,
make
light
of
their
threatening
;
but
the
two
englishman
resolve
to
have
their
remedy
against
them
,
what
pain
soever
it
cost
to
find
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Spaniards
interpose
here
too
,
and
tell
them
,
that
they
be
already
disarm
:
they
could
not
consent
that
they
(
the
two
)
should
pursue
them
with
fire
-
arm
,
and
perhaps
kill
them
:
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
the
grave
Spaniard
,
who
be
their
governor
,
"
we
will
endeavour
to
make
them
do
you
justice
,
if
you
will
leave
it
to
us
;
for
,
as
there
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
they
will
come
to
us
again
<EOS>
when
their
passion
be
over
,
be
not
able
to
subsist
without
our
assistance
,
we
promise
you
to
make
no
peace
with
them
,
without
have
full
satisfaction
for
you
;
and
upon
this
condition
we
hope
you
will
promise
to
use
no
violence
with
them
,
other
than
in
your
defence
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
Englishmen
;
yield
to
this
very
awkwardly
and
with
great
reluctance
;
but
the
Spaniards
protest
,
they
do
it
only
to
keep
them
from
bloodshed
,
and
to
make
all
easy
at
last
;
"
for
,
"
say
they
,
"
we
be
not
so
many
of
us
;
here
be
room
enough
for
us
all
,
and
it
be
great
pity
we
should
not
be
all
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
at
length
they
do
consent
,
and
wait
for
the
issue
of
the
thing
,
live
for
some
day
with
the
Spaniards
;
for
their
own
habitation
be
destroy
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
five
day
time
the
three
vagrant
,
tired
with
wander
,
and
almost
starve
with
hunger
,
have
chiefly
live
on
turtle
'
egg
all
that
while
,
come
back
to
the
grove
:
and
find
my
Spaniard
,
who
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
the
governor
,
and
two
more
with
him
,
walk
by
the
side
of
the
creek
;
they
come
up
in
a
very
submissive
humble
manner
,
and
beg
to
be
receive
again
into
the
family
.
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
use
them
civilly
,
but
tell
them
,
they
have
act
so
unnaturally
by
their
countryman
,
and
so
very
grossly
by
them
,
(
the
Spaniards
)
that
they
could
not
come
to
any
conclusion
without
consult
the
two
Englishmen
,
and
the
rest
;
but
however
they
would
go
to
them
and
discourse
about
it
,
and
they
should
know
in
half
-
an
-
hour
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
guess
that
they
be
very
hard
put
to
it
;
for
,
as
they
be
to
wait
this
half
-
hour
for
an
answer
,
they
beg
they
would
send
them
out
some
bread
in
the
meantime
,
which
they
do
,
send
at
the
same
time
a
large
piece
of
goat
's
flesh
and
a
boil
parrot
,
which
they
eat
very
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
after
half
-
an
-
hour
's
consultation
they
be
call
in
,
and
a
long
debate
ensue
,
their
two
countryman
charge
them
with
the
ruin
of
all
their
labour
,
and
a
design
to
murder
them
;
all
which
they
own
before
,
and
therefore
could
not
deny
now
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
the
Spaniards
act
the
moderator
between
them
;
and
as
they
have
oblige
the
two
englishman
not
to
hurt
the
three
while
they
be
naked
and
unarmed
,
so
they
now
oblige
the
three
to
go
and
rebuild
their
fellow
'
two
hut
,
one
to
be
of
the
same
and
the
other
of
large
dimension
than
they
be
before
;
to
fence
their
ground
again
,
plant
tree
in
the
room
of
those
pull
up
,
dig
up
the
land
again
for
plant
corn
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
to
restore
everything
to
the
same
state
as
they
find
it
,
that
is
,
as
near
as
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
they
submit
to
all
this
;
and
as
they
have
plenty
of
provision
give
them
all
the
while
,
they
grow
very
orderly
,
and
the
whole
society
begin
to
live
pleasantly
and
agreeably
together
again
;
only
that
these
three
fellow
could
never
be
persuade
to
work
 
I
mean
for
themselves
 
except
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
little
,
just
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
Spaniards
tell
them
plainly
that
if
they
would
but
live
sociably
and
friendly
together
,
and
study
the
good
of
the
whole
plantation
,
they
would
be
content
to
work
for
them
,
and
let
them
walk
about
and
be
as
idle
as
they
please
;
and
thus
,
have
live
pretty
well
together
for
a
month
or
two
,
the
Spaniards
let
them
have
arm
again
,
and
give
them
liberty
to
go
abroad
with
them
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
above
a
week
after
they
have
these
arm
,
and
go
abroad
,
before
the
ungrateful
creature
begin
to
be
as
insolent
and
troublesome
as
ever
.
<EOS>
however
,
an
accident
happen
presently
upon
this
,
which
endanger
the
safety
of
them
all
,
and
they
be
oblige
to
lay
by
all
private
resentment
,
and
look
to
the
preservation
of
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
one
night
that
the
governor
,
the
Spaniard
whose
life
I
have
save
,
who
be
now
the
governor
of
the
rest
,
find
himself
very
uneasy
in
the
night
,
and
could
by
no
mean
get
any
sleep
<EOS>
:
he
be
perfectly
well
in
body
,
only
find
his
thought
tumultuous
;
his
mind
run
upon
man
fight
and
kill
one
another
;
but
he
be
broad
awake
,
and
could
not
by
any
mean
get
any
sleep
;
in
short
,
he
lie
a
great
while
,
but
grow
more
and
more
uneasy
,
he
resolve
to
rise
.
<EOS>
as
they
lie
,
be
so
many
of
them
,
on
goat
-
skin
lay
thick
upon
such
couch
and
pad
as
they
make
for
themselves
,
so
they
have
little
to
do
,
when
they
be
willing
to
rise
,
but
to
get
upon
their
foot
,
and
perhaps
put
on
a
coat
,
such
as
it
be
,
and
their
pump
,
and
they
be
ready
for
go
any
way
that
their
thought
guide
them
.
<EOS>
be
thus
get
up
,
he
look
out
;
but
be
dark
,
he
could
see
little
or
nothing
,
and
besides
,
the
tree
which
I
have
plant
,
and
which
be
now
grow
tall
,
intercept
his
sight
,
so
that
he
could
only
look
up
,
and
see
that
it
be
a
starlight
night
,
and
hear
no
noise
,
he
return
and
lie
down
again
;
but
to
no
purpose
;
he
could
not
compose
himself
to
anything
like
rest
;
but
his
thought
be
to
the
last
degree
uneasy
,
and
he
know
not
for
what
.
  
<EOS>
have
make
some
noise
with
rise
and
walk
about
,
go
out
and
come
in
,
another
of
them
wake
,
and
,
call
,
ask
who
it
be
that
be
up
?
<EOS>
the
governor
tell
him
how
it
have
be
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
say
you
so
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
other
Spaniard
;
"
such
thing
be
not
to
be
slight
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
there
be
certainly
some
mischief
working
,
"
say
he
,
"
near
us
;
"
and
presently
he
ask
him
,
"
where
be
the
Englishmen
?
"
<EOS>
"
They
be
all
in
their
hut
,
"
say
he
,
"
safe
enough
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
,
the
Spaniards
have
keep
possession
of
the
main
apartment
,
and
have
make
a
place
,
where
the
three
Englishmen
,
since
their
last
mutiny
,
always
quarter
by
themselves
,
and
could
not
come
at
the
rest
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
"
there
be
something
in
it
,
I
be
persuade
from
my
own
experience
;
I
be
satisfied
our
spirit
embody
have
converse
with
,
and
receive
intelligence
from
,
the
spirit
unembodied
,
and
inhabit
the
invisible
world
;
and
this
friendly
notice
be
give
for
our
advantage
,
if
we
know
how
to
make
use
of
it
.
<EOS>
come
,
"
say
he
,
"
let
us
go
out
and
look
abroad
;
and
if
we
find
nothing
at
all
in
it
to
justify
our
trouble
,
I
will
tell
you
a
story
of
the
purpose
,
that
shall
convince
you
of
the
justice
of
my
propose
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
go
out
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
where
I
use
to
go
;
but
they
,
be
strong
,
and
in
good
company
,
nor
alone
,
as
I
be
,
use
none
of
my
caution
to
go
up
by
the
ladder
,
and
then
pull
it
up
after
them
,
to
go
up
a
second
stage
to
the
top
but
be
go
round
through
the
grove
unconcerned
and
unwary
,
when
they
be
surprised
with
see
a
light
as
of
fire
,
a
very
little
way
off
from
them
,
and
hear
the
voice
of
man
,
not
of
one
or
two
,
but
of
a
great
number
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
the
discovery
I
have
make
of
the
savage
landing
on
the
island
,
it
be
my
constant
care
to
prevent
them
make
the
least
discovery
of
there
be
any
inhabitant
upon
the
place
;
and
when
by
any
necessity
they
come
to
know
it
,
they
feel
it
so
effectively
,
that
they
that
get
away
,
be
scarce
able
to
give
any
account
of
it
,
for
we
disappear
as
soon
as
possible
,
nor
do
ever
any
that
have
see
me
,
escape
to
tell
any
one
else
,
except
it
be
the
three
savage
in
our
last
encounter
,
who
jump
into
the
boat
,
of
whom
I
mention
that
I
be
afraid
they
should
go
home
,
and
bring
more
help
.
  
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
consequence
of
the
escape
of
those
man
,
that
so
great
a
number
come
now
together
;
or
whether
they
come
ignorantly
,
and
by
accident
,
on
their
usual
bloody
errand
,
the
Spaniards
could
not
,
it
seem
,
understand
:
but
whatever
it
be
,
it
have
be
their
business
,
either
to
have
:
conceal
themselves
,
and
not
have
see
them
at
all
;
much
less
to
have
let
the
savage
have
see
,
that
there
be
any
inhabitant
in
the
place
;
but
to
have
fall
upon
them
so
effectually
,
as
that
not
a
man
of
them
should
have
escape
,
which
could
only
have
be
by
get
in
between
them
and
their
boat
:
but
this
presence
of
mind
be
want
to
them
;
which
be
the
ruin
of
their
tranquillity
for
a
great
while
.
  
<EOS>
We
need
not
doubt
but
that
the
governor
,
and
the
man
with
him
,
surprised
with
this
sight
,
run
back
immediately
,
and
raise
their
fellow
,
give
them
an
account
of
the
imminent
danger
they
be
all
in
;
and
they
again
as
readily
take
the
alarm
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
persuade
them
to
stay
close
within
where
they
be
,
but
that
they
must
all
run
out
to
see
how
thing
stand
.
  
<EOS>
while
it
be
dark
indeed
,
they
be
well
enough
,
and
they
have
opportunity
enough
,
for
some
hour
,
to
view
them
by
the
light
of
three
fire
they
have
make
at
some
distance
from
one
another
;
what
they
be
do
they
know
not
,
and
what
to
do
themselves
they
know
not
;
for
,
first
,
the
enemy
be
too
many
;
and
,
secondly
,
they
do
not
keep
together
,
but
be
divide
into
several
party
,
and
be
on
shore
in
several
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
be
in
no
small
consternation
at
this
sight
;
and
as
they
find
that
the
fellow
run
straggle
all
over
the
shore
,
they
make
no
doubt
,
but
,
first
or
last
,
some
of
them
would
chop
in
upon
their
habitation
,
or
upon
some
other
place
,
where
they
would
see
the
token
of
inhabitant
;
and
they
be
in
great
perplexity
also
for
fear
of
their
flock
of
goat
,
which
would
have
be
little
less
than
starve
them
,
if
they
should
have
be
destroy
;
so
the
first
thing
they
resolve
upon
,
be
to
dispatch
three
man
away
before
it
be
light
,
viz
.
<EOS>
two
Spaniards
and
one
Englishman
,
to
drive
all
the
goat
away
to
the
great
valley
where
the
cave
be
,
and
,
if
need
be
,
to
drive
them
into
the
very
cave
itself
.
  
<EOS>
Could
they
have
see
the
savage
all
together
in
one
body
,
and
at
a
distance
from
their
canoe
,
they
resolve
,
if
there
have
be
an
hundred
of
them
,
to
have
attack
them
;
but
that
could
not
be
obtain
,
for
there
be
some
of
them
two
mile
off
from
the
other
,
and
,
as
it
appear
afterwards
,
be
of
two
different
nation
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
muse
a
great
while
on
the
course
they
should
take
,
and
beaten
their
brain
in
consider
their
present
circumstance
,
they
resolve
,
at
last
while
it
be
dark
,
to
send
the
old
savage
(
Friday
's
father
)
out
as
a
spy
,
to
learn
if
possible
something
concern
them
,
as
what
they
come
for
,
and
what
they
intend
to
do
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
readily
undertake
it
,
and
strip
himself
quite
naked
,
as
most
of
the
savage
be
,
away
he
go
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
be
go
an
hour
or
two
,
he
bring
word
that
he
have
be
among
them
undiscovered
,
that
he
find
they
be
two
party
,
and
of
two
several
nation
who
have
war
with
one
another
,
and
have
have
a
great
battle
in
their
own
country
,
and
that
both
side
have
have
several
prisoner
take
in
the
fight
,
they
be
by
mere
chance
land
in
the
same
island
for
the
devour
their
prisoner
,
and
make
merry
;
but
this
come
so
by
chance
to
the
same
place
have
spoil
all
their
mirth
;
that
they
be
in
a
great
rage
at
one
another
,
and
be
so
near
,
that
he
believe
they
would
fight
again
as
soon
as
daylight
begin
to
appear
;
he
do
not
perceive
that
they
have
any
notion
of
anybody
's
be
on
the
island
but
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
make
an
end
of
tell
the
story
,
when
they
could
perceive
,
by
the
unusual
noise
they
make
,
that
the
two
little
army
be
engage
in
a
bloody
fight
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
's
father
use
all
the
argument
he
could
to
persuade
our
people
to
lie
close
,
and
not
be
see
;
he
tell
them
their
safety
consist
in
it
,
and
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
lie
still
,
and
the
savage
would
kill
one
another
to
their
hand
,
and
the
rest
would
go
away
;
and
it
be
so
to
a
tittle
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
prevail
,
especially
upon
the
Englishmen
,
their
curiosity
be
so
importunate
upon
their
prudential
,
that
they
must
run
out
and
see
the
battle
;
however
,
they
use
some
caution
,
viz
.
<EOS>
they
do
not
go
openly
just
by
their
own
dwelling
,
but
go
farther
into
the
wood
,
and
place
themselves
to
advantage
,
where
they
may
securely
see
them
manage
the
fight
,
and
,
as
they
think
,
not
to
be
see
by
them
;
but
it
seem
the
savage
do
see
them
,
as
we
shall
find
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
the
battle
be
very
fierce
,
and
if
I
may
believe
the
Englishmen
,
one
of
them
say
he
could
perceive
that
some
of
them
be
man
of
great
bravery
,
of
invincible
spirit
,
and
of
great
policy
in
guide
the
fight
.
<EOS>
the
battle
,
they
say
,
hold
two
hour
before
they
could
guess
which
party
would
be
beat
;
but
then
that
party
which
be
near
our
people
's
habitation
begin
to
appear
weak
,
and
,
after
some
time
more
,
some
of
them
begin
to
fly
;
and
this
put
our
man
again
into
a
great
consternation
,
lest
any
of
those
that
flee
should
run
into
the
grove
before
their
dwelling
for
shelter
,
and
thereby
involuntarily
discover
the
place
,
and
that
by
consequence
the
pursuer
should
do
the
like
in
search
for
them
.
<EOS>
upon
this
they
resolve
,
that
they
would
stand
armed
within
the
wall
,
and
whoever
come
into
the
grove
they
should
sally
out
over
the
wall
,
and
kill
them
,
so
that
if
possible
not
one
should
return
to
give
an
account
of
it
;
they
order
also
,
that
it
should
be
do
with
their
sword
,
or
by
knock
them
down
with
the
stock
of
the
musket
,
not
by
shoot
them
,
for
fear
of
raise
an
alarm
by
the
noise
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
expect
it
fall
out
:
three
of
the
route
army
flee
for
life
,
and
cross
the
creek
run
directly
into
the
place
,
not
in
the
least
know
whither
they
go
,
but
run
as
into
a
thick
wood
for
shelter
.
<EOS>
the
scout
they
keep
to
look
abroad
give
notice
of
this
within
,
with
this
addition
to
our
man
's
great
satisfaction
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
conqueror
have
not
pursue
them
,
or
see
which
way
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
Spaniard
governor
,
a
man
of
humanity
,
would
not
suffer
them
to
kill
the
three
fugitive
;
but
send
three
man
out
by
the
top
of
the
hill
,
order
them
to
go
round
and
come
in
behind
them
,
surprise
and
take
them
prisoner
;
which
be
do
:
the
residue
of
the
conquered
people
flee
to
their
canoe
,
and
get
off
to
sea
;
the
victor
retire
,
and
make
no
pursuit
,
or
very
little
,
but
draw
themselves
into
a
body
together
,
give
two
great
screaming
shout
,
which
they
suppose
be
by
way
of
triumph
,
and
so
the
fight
end
;
and
the
same
day
,
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
they
also
march
to
their
canoe
.
<EOS>
and
thus
the
Spaniards
have
their
island
again
free
to
themselves
,
their
fright
be
over
,
and
they
see
no
savage
in
several
year
after
.
  
<EOS>
after
they
be
all
go
,
the
Spaniards
come
out
of
their
den
,
and
view
the
field
of
battle
,
they
find
about
two
-
and
-
thirty
dead
man
upon
the
spot
;
some
be
kill
with
great
long
arrow
,
several
of
which
be
find
stick
in
their
body
,
but
most
of
them
be
kill
with
their
great
wooden
sword
,
sixteen
or
seventeen
of
which
they
find
in
the
field
of
battle
,
and
as
many
bow
,
with
a
great
many
arrow
.
<EOS>
these
sword
be
great
unwieldy
thing
,
and
they
must
be
very
strong
man
that
use
them
;
most
of
those
man
that
be
kill
with
them
have
their
head
mash
to
piece
,
as
we
may
say
,
or
,
as
we
call
it
in
English
,
their
brain
knock
out
,
and
several
of
their
arm
and
leg
break
;
so
that
it
be
evident
<EOS>
they
fight
with
inexpressible
rage
and
fury
.
<EOS>
They
find
not
one
wounded
man
that
be
not
stone
dead
;
for
either
they
stay
by
their
enemy
till
they
have
quite
kill
them
,
or
they
carry
all
the
wounded
man
,
that
be
not
quite
dead
,
away
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
deliverance
tame
our
Englishmen
for
a
great
while
;
the
sight
have
fill
them
with
horror
,
and
the
consequence
appear
terrible
to
the
last
degree
;
especially
upon
suppose
that
some
time
or
other
they
should
fall
into
the
hand
of
those
creature
,
who
would
not
only
kill
them
as
enemy
,
but
kill
them
for
food
as
we
kill
our
cattle
.
<EOS>
and
they
profess
to
me
,
that
the
thought
of
be
eat
up
like
beef
or
mutton
,
though
it
be
suppose
it
be
not
to
be
till
they
be
dead
,
have
something
in
it
so
horrible
that
it
nauseate
their
very
stomach
,
make
them
sick
when
they
think
of
it
,
and
fill
their
mind
with
unusual
terror
,
that
they
be
not
themselves
for
some
week
after
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
as
I
say
,
tame
even
the
three
english
brute
I
have
be
speak
of
,
and
for
a
great
while
after
they
be
very
tractable
,
and
go
about
the
common
business
of
the
whole
society
well
enough
;
plant
,
sow
,
reap
,
and
begin
to
be
all
naturalize
to
the
country
;
but
some
time
after
this
they
fall
all
into
such
simple
measure
again
as
bring
them
into
a
great
deal
of
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
take
three
prisoner
,
as
I
have
observe
;
and
these
three
be
lusty
stout
young
fellow
,
they
make
them
servant
,
and
teach
them
to
work
for
them
;
and
as
slave
they
do
well
enough
;
but
they
do
not
take
their
measure
with
them
as
I
do
by
my
man
Friday
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
begin
with
them
upon
the
principle
of
have
save
their
life
,
and
then
instruct
them
in
the
rational
principle
of
life
,
much
less
of
religion
,
civilize
and
reduce
them
by
kind
usage
and
affectionate
arguing
;
but
as
they
give
them
their
food
every
day
,
so
they
give
them
their
work
too
,
and
keep
them
fully
employ
in
drudgery
enough
;
but
they
fail
in
this
by
it
,
that
they
never
have
them
to
assist
them
and
fight
for
them
as
I
have
my
man
Friday
,
who
be
as
true
to
me
as
the
very
flesh
upon
my
bone
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
come
to
the
family
part
:
be
all
now
good
friend
(
for
common
danger
,
as
I
say
above
,
have
effectually
reconcile
them
,
)
they
begin
to
consider
their
general
circumstance
;
and
the
first
thing
that
come
under
their
consideration
be
,
whether
,
see
the
savage
particularly
haunt
that
side
of
the
island
,
and
that
there
be
more
remote
and
retired
part
of
it
equally
adapt
to
their
way
of
living
,
and
manifestly
to
their
advantage
,
they
should
not
rather
remove
their
habitation
,
and
plant
in
some
more
proper
place
for
their
safety
,
and
especially
for
the
security
of
their
cattle
and
corn
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
after
long
debate
,
it
be
conceive
that
they
should
not
remove
their
habitation
,
because
that
some
time
or
other
they
think
they
may
hear
from
their
governor
again
,
mean
me
;
and
if
I
should
send
any
one
to
seek
them
,
I
would
be
sure
to
direct
them
on
that
side
,
where
if
they
should
find
the
place
demolish
they
would
conclude
the
savage
have
kill
us
all
,
and
we
be
go
,
and
so
our
supply
would
go
away
too
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
to
their
corn
and
cattle
,
they
agree
to
remove
them
into
the
valley
where
my
cave
be
,
where
the
land
be
as
proper
to
both
,
and
where
indeed
there
be
land
enough
;
however
,
upon
second
thought
they
alter
one
part
of
that
resolution
too
,
and
resolve
only
to
remove
part
of
their
cattle
thither
,
and
plant
part
of
their
corn
there
;
and
so
,
if
one
part
be
destroy
,
the
other
may
be
save
;
and
one
piece
of
prudence
they
use
,
which
it
be
very
well
they
do
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
never
trust
these
three
savage
,
which
they
have
take
prisoner
,
with
know
any
thing
of
the
plantation
they
have
make
in
that
valley
,
or
of
any
cattle
they
have
there
;
much
less
of
the
cave
there
,
which
they
keep
in
case
of
necessity
as
a
safe
retreat
;
and
thither
they
carry
also
the
two
barrel
of
powder
which
I
have
leave
them
at
my
come
away
.
  
<EOS>
but
however
they
resolve
not
to
change
their
habitation
;
yet
they
agree
,
that
as
I
have
carefully
cover
it
first
with
a
wall
and
fortification
,
and
then
with
a
grove
of
tree
;
so
see
their
safety
consist
entirely
in
their
be
conceal
,
of
which
they
be
now
fully
convinced
,
they
set
to
work
to
cover
and
conceal
the
place
yet
more
effectually
than
before
:
to
this
purpose
,
as
I
have
plant
tree
(
or
rather
thrust
in
stake
which
in
time
all
grow
to
be
tree
)
for
some
good
distance
before
the
entrance
into
my
apartment
<EOS>
,
they
go
on
in
the
same
manner
,
and
fill
up
the
rest
of
that
whole
space
of
ground
,
from
the
tree
I
have
set
quite
down
to
the
side
of
the
creek
,
where
,
as
I
say
,
I
land
my
float
,
and
even
into
the
very
ooze
where
the
tide
flow
,
not
so
much
as
leave
any
place
to
land
,
or
any
sign
that
there
have
be
any
landing
thereabout
.
<EOS>
these
stake
also
be
of
a
wood
very
forward
to
grow
,
as
I
have
note
formerly
,
they
take
care
to
have
generally
very
much
large
and
tall
than
those
which
I
have
plant
,
and
place
them
so
very
thick
and
close
,
that
when
they
have
be
three
or
four
year
grow
there
be
no
piercing
with
the
eye
any
considerable
way
into
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
as
for
that
part
which
I
have
plant
,
the
tree
be
grow
as
thick
as
a
man
's
thigh
;
and
among
them
they
place
so
many
other
short
one
,
and
so
thick
,
that
,
in
a
word
,
it
stand
like
a
palisado
a
quarter
of
a
mile
thick
,
and
it
be
next
to
impossible
to
penetrate
it
<EOS>
but
with
a
little
army
to
cut
it
all
down
;
for
a
little
dog
could
hardly
get
between
the
tree
,
they
stand
so
close
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
;
for
they
do
the
same
by
all
the
ground
to
the
right
hand
,
and
to
the
left
,
and
round
even
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
leave
no
way
,
not
so
much
as
for
themselves
to
come
out
,
but
by
the
ladder
place
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
and
then
lift
up
and
place
again
from
the
first
stage
up
to
the
top
;
which
ladder
,
when
it
be
take
down
,
nothing
but
what
have
wing
or
witchcraft
to
assist
it
,
could
come
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
excellently
well
contrived
,
nor
be
it
less
than
what
they
afterwards
find
occasion
for
;
which
serve
to
convince
me
,
that
as
human
prudence
have
authority
of
Providence
to
justify
it
,
so
it
have
,
doubtless
,
the
direction
of
Providence
to
set
it
to
work
,
and
,
would
we
listen
carefully
to
the
voice
of
it
,
I
be
fully
persuade
we
may
prevent
many
of
the
disaster
which
our
life
be
now
by
our
own
negligence
subject
to
:
but
this
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
story
:
<EOS>
They
live
two
year
after
this
in
perfect
retirement
,
and
have
no
more
visit
from
the
savage
;
they
have
indeed
an
alarm
give
them
one
morning
,
which
put
them
in
a
great
consternation
for
some
of
the
Spaniards
be
out
early
one
morning
on
the
west
side
,
or
rather
end
of
the
island
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
that
end
where
I
never
go
,
for
fear
of
be
discover
,
they
be
surprised
with
see
above
twenty
canoe
of
Indians
just
come
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
They
make
the
good
of
their
way
home
in
hurry
enough
,
and
,
give
the
alarm
to
their
comrade
,
they
keep
close
all
that
day
and
the
next
,
go
out
only
at
night
to
make
observation
;
but
they
have
the
good
luck
to
be
mistake
,
for
wherever
the
savage
go
,
they
do
not
land
at
that
time
on
the
island
,
but
pursue
some
other
design
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
they
have
another
broil
with
the
three
Englishmen
,
one
of
which
,
a
most
turbulent
fellow
,
be
in
a
rage
at
one
of
the
three
slave
which
I
mention
they
have
take
,
because
the
fellow
have
not
do
something
right
which
he
bid
him
do
,
and
seem
a
little
untractable
in
his
shew
him
,
draw
a
hatchet
out
of
a
frog
-
belt
,
in
which
he
bear
it
by
his
side
,
and
fall
upon
him
,
the
poor
savage
,
not
to
correct
him
but
to
kill
him
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
Spaniards
who
be
by
,
see
him
give
the
fellow
a
barbarous
cut
with
the
hatchet
which
he
aim
at
his
head
,
but
strike
into
his
shoulder
,
so
that
he
think
he
have
cut
the
poor
creature
's
arm
off
,
run
to
him
,
and
entreat
him
not
to
murder
the
poor
man
,
clapt
in
between
him
and
the
savage
to
prevent
the
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
enrage
the
more
at
this
,
strike
at
the
Spaniard
with
his
hatchet
,
and
swear
he
would
serve
him
as
he
intend
to
serve
the
savage
;
which
the
Spaniard
perceiving
,
avoid
the
blow
,
and
with
a
shovel
which
he
have
in
his
hand
<EOS>
(
for
they
be
work
in
the
field
about
the
corn
-
land
)
<EOS>
knock
the
brute
down
;
another
of
the
Englishmen
run
at
the
same
time
to
help
his
comrade
,
knock
the
Spaniard
down
,
and
then
two
Spaniards
more
come
to
help
their
man
,
and
a
third
Englishman
fall
upon
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
none
of
them
any
fire
-
arm
,
or
any
other
weapon
but
hatchet
and
other
tool
,
except
the
third
Englishman
;
he
have
one
of
my
old
rusty
cutlass
,
with
which
he
make
at
the
last
Spaniards
,
and
wound
them
both
.
<EOS>
this
fray
set
the
whole
family
in
an
uproar
,
and
more
help
come
in
,
they
take
the
three
Englishmen
prisoner
.
<EOS>
the
next
question
be
,
what
should
be
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
they
have
be
so
often
mutinous
,
and
be
so
furious
,
so
desperate
,
and
so
idle
withal
,
that
they
know
not
what
course
to
take
with
them
,
for
they
be
mischievous
to
the
high
degree
,
and
value
not
what
hurt
they
do
any
man
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
it
be
not
safe
to
live
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
who
be
governor
,
tell
them
in
so
many
word
,
that
if
they
have
be
his
own
countryman
he
would
have
hang
them
all
;
for
all
law
and
all
governor
be
to
preserve
society
,
and
those
who
be
dangerous
to
the
society
ought
to
be
expel
out
of
it
;
but
as
they
be
Englishmen
,
and
that
it
be
to
the
generous
kindness
of
an
Englishman
that
they
all
owe
their
preservation
and
deliverance
,
he
would
use
them
with
all
possible
lenity
,
and
would
leave
them
to
the
judgment
of
the
other
two
englishman
,
who
be
their
countryman
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
two
honest
Englishmen
stand
up
,
and
say
they
desire
it
may
not
be
leave
to
them
;
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
sure
we
ought
to
sentence
them
to
the
gallow
,
"
and
with
that
give
an
account
how
Will
Atkins
,
one
of
the
three
,
have
propose
to
have
all
the
five
englishman
join
together
,
and
murder
all
the
Spaniards
when
they
be
in
their
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
spanish
governor
hear
this
,
he
call
to
Will
Atkins
:
"
how
,
Seignior
Atkins
,
"
say
he
,
"
will
you
murder
us
all
?
<EOS>
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
?
"
<EOS>
that
harden
villain
be
so
far
from
deny
it
,
that
he
say
it
be
true
,
and
g
-
d
d
<EOS>
-
mn
him
<EOS>
they
would
do
it
still
before
they
have
do
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
Seignior
Atkins
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
"
what
have
we
do
to
you
that
you
will
kill
us
?
<EOS>
and
what
would
you
get
by
kill
us
?
<EOS>
and
what
must
we
do
to
prevent
your
kill
us
?
<EOS>
Must
we
kill
you
,
or
will
you
kill
us
?
<EOS>
why
will
you
put
us
to
the
necessity
of
this
,
Seignior
Atkins
?
"
say
the
Spaniard
very
calmly
and
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Seignior
Atkins
be
in
such
a
rage
at
the
Spaniard
's
make
a
jest
of
it
,
that
have
he
not
be
hold
by
three
man
,
and
withal
have
no
weapon
with
him
,
it
be
think
he
would
have
attempt
to
have
kill
the
Spaniard
in
the
middle
of
all
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
this
harebraine
carriage
oblige
them
to
consider
seriously
what
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
two
Englishmen
and
the
Spaniard
who
save
the
poor
savage
,
be
of
the
opinion
that
they
should
hang
one
of
the
three
for
an
example
to
the
rest
;
and
that
particularly
it
should
be
he
that
have
twice
attempt
to
commit
murder
with
his
hatchet
;
and
indeed
there
be
some
reason
to
believe
he
have
do
it
,
for
the
poor
savage
be
in
such
a
miserable
condition
with
the
wound
he
have
receive
,
that
it
be
think
he
could
not
live
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
governor
Spaniard
still
say
,
no
,
it
be
an
Englishman
that
have
save
all
their
life
,
and
he
would
never
consent
to
put
an
Englishman
to
death
though
he
have
murder
half
of
them
;
nay
,
he
say
if
he
have
be
kill
himself
by
an
Englishman
,
and
have
time
leave
to
speak
,
it
should
be
that
they
should
pardon
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
positively
insist
on
by
the
governor
Spaniard
,
that
there
be
no
gainsay
it
;
and
as
merciful
counsel
be
most
apt
to
prevail
,
where
they
be
so
earnestly
press
,
so
they
all
come
into
it
;
but
then
it
be
to
be
consider
what
should
be
do
to
keep
them
from
the
mischief
they
design
;
for
all
agree
,
governor
and
all
,
that
mean
be
to
be
use
for
preserve
the
society
from
danger
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
debate
it
be
agree
,
first
,
that
they
should
be
disarm
,
and
not
permit
to
have
either
gun
,
or
powder
,
or
shoot
,
or
sword
,
or
any
weapon
,
and
should
be
turn
out
of
the
society
,
and
leave
to
live
where
they
would
,
and
how
they
could
by
themselves
;
but
that
none
of
the
rest
,
either
Spaniards
or
English
,
should
converse
with
them
,
speak
with
them
,
or
have
any
thing
to
do
with
them
;
that
they
should
be
forbid
to
come
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
place
where
the
rest
dwelt
;
and
that
if
they
offer
to
commit
any
disorder
,
so
as
to
spoil
,
burn
,
kill
,
or
destroy
any
of
the
corn
,
planting
,
building
,
fence
,
or
cattle
belong
to
the
society
,
that
they
should
die
without
mercy
,
and
would
shoot
them
wherever
they
could
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
,
a
man
of
great
humanity
,
muse
upon
the
sentence
,
consider
a
little
upon
it
,
and
turn
to
the
two
honest
Englishmen
,
say
,
"
hold
,
you
must
reflect
,
that
it
will
be
long
ere
they
can
raise
corn
and
cattle
of
their
own
,
and
they
must
not
starve
;
we
must
therefore
allow
them
provision
.
"
<EOS>
so
he
cause
to
be
add
,
that
they
should
have
a
proportion
of
corn
give
them
to
last
them
eight
month
,
and
for
seed
to
sow
,
by
which
time
they
may
be
suppose
to
raise
some
of
their
own
;
that
they
should
have
six
milch
-
goat
,
four
he
-
goat
,
and
six
kid
<EOS>
give
them
,
as
well
for
present
subsistence
as
for
a
store
;
and
that
they
should
have
tool
give
them
for
their
work
in
the
field
;
such
as
six
hatchet
,
an
axe
,
a
saw
,
and
the
like
:
<EOS>
but
they
should
have
none
of
these
tool
or
provision
unless
they
would
swear
solemnly
that
they
would
not
hurt
or
injure
any
of
the
Spaniards
with
them
,
or
of
their
fellow
Englishmen
.
  
<EOS>
thus
they
dismiss
them
the
society
,
and
turn
them
out
to
shift
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
go
away
sullen
and
refractory
,
as
neither
content
to
go
away
or
to
stay
;
but
as
there
be
no
remedy
they
go
,
pretend
to
go
and
choose
a
place
where
they
should
settle
themselves
,
to
plant
and
live
by
themselves
;
and
some
provision
be
give
,
but
no
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
about
four
or
five
day
after
they
come
again
for
some
victual
,
and
give
the
governor
an
account
where
they
have
pitch
their
tent
,
and
mark
themselves
out
an
habitation
or
plantation
:
it
be
a
very
convenient
place
indeed
,
on
the
remote
part
of
the
island
,
N.E.
much
about
the
place
where
I
providentially
land
in
my
first
voyage
when
I
be
drive
out
to
sea
,
the
Lord
alone
know
whither
,
in
my
foolish
attempt
to
surround
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
build
themselves
two
handsome
hut
,
and
contrive
them
in
a
manner
like
my
first
habitation
be
close
under
the
side
of
a
hill
,
have
some
tree
grow
already
to
the
three
side
of
it
;
so
that
by
plant
other
it
would
be
very
easily
cover
from
the
sight
,
unless
narrowly
search
for
.
<EOS>
They
desire
some
dry
goat
-
skin
for
bed
and
covering
,
which
be
give
them
;
and
upon
their
give
their
word
that
they
would
not
disturb
the
rest
,
or
injure
any
of
their
plantation
,
they
give
them
hatchet
,
and
what
other
tool
they
could
spare
;
some
pea
,
barley
,
and
rice
,
for
sowing
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
any
thing
they
want
but
arm
and
ammunition
.
  
<EOS>
They
live
in
this
separate
condition
about
six
month
,
and
have
get
in
their
first
harvest
,
though
the
quantity
be
but
small
,
the
parcel
of
land
they
have
plant
be
but
little
;
for
indeed
have
all
their
plantation
to
form
,
they
have
a
great
deal
of
work
upon
their
hand
;
and
when
they
come
to
make
board
,
and
pot
,
and
such
thing
,
they
be
quite
out
of
their
element
,
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
;
and
when
the
rainy
season
come
on
,
for
want
of
a
cave
in
the
earth
,
they
could
not
keep
their
grain
dry
,
and
it
be
in
great
danger
of
spoil
:
and
this
humble
them
much
;
so
they
come
and
beg
the
Spaniards
to
help
them
,
which
they
very
readily
do
;
and
in
four
day
work
a
great
hole
in
the
side
of
the
hill
for
them
,
big
enough
to
secure
their
corn
and
other
thing
from
the
rain
:
but
it
be
but
a
poor
place
at
best
compare
to
mine
;
and
especially
as
mine
be
then
;
for
the
Spaniards
have
greatly
enlarge
it
,
and
make
several
new
apartment
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
about
three
quarter
of
a
year
after
this
separation
a
new
frolic
take
these
rogue
,
which
,
together
with
the
former
villany
they
have
commit
,
bring
mischief
enough
upon
them
,
and
have
very
near
be
the
ruin
of
the
whole
colony
.
<EOS>
the
three
new
associate
begin
,
it
seem
,
to
be
weary
of
the
laborious
life
they
lead
,
and
that
without
hope
of
better
their
circumstance
;
and
a
whim
take
them
that
they
would
make
a
voyage
to
the
continent
from
whence
the
savage
come
,
and
would
try
if
they
could
not
seize
upon
some
prisoner
among
the
native
there
,
and
bring
them
home
,
so
as
to
make
them
do
the
laborious
part
of
the
work
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
project
be
not
so
preposterous
if
they
have
go
no
farther
;
but
they
do
nothing
and
propose
nothing
but
have
either
mischief
in
the
design
or
mischief
in
the
event
;
and
if
I
may
give
my
opinion
,
they
seem
to
be
under
a
blast
from
Heaven
;
for
if
we
will
not
allow
a
visible
curse
to
pursue
visible
crime
,
how
shall
we
reconcile
the
event
of
thing
with
divine
justice
?
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
an
apparent
vengeance
on
their
crime
of
mutiny
and
piracy
that
bring
them
to
the
state
they
be
in
;
and
as
they
shew
not
the
least
remorse
for
the
crime
,
but
add
new
villanie
to
it
,
such
as
particularly
that
piece
of
monstrous
cruelty
of
wound
a
poor
slave
because
he
do
not
,
or
perhaps
could
not
understand
to
do
what
he
be
direct
,
and
to
wound
him
in
such
a
manner
as
,
no
question
,
make
him
a
cripple
<EOS>
all
his
life
,
and
in
a
place
where
no
surgeon
or
medicine
could
be
have
for
his
cure
;
and
what
be
still
bad
,
the
murderous
intent
,
or
,
to
do
justice
to
the
crime
,
the
intentional
murder
,
for
such
to
be
sure
it
be
,
as
be
afterwards
the
form
design
they
all
lay
to
murder
the
Spaniards
in
cold
blood
,
and
in
their
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
leave
observe
,
and
return
to
the
story
:
the
three
fellow
come
down
to
the
Spaniards
one
morning
,
and
in
very
humble
term
desire
to
be
admit
to
speak
with
them
;
the
Spaniards
very
readily
hear
what
they
have
to
say
,
which
be
this
,
that
they
be
tired
of
live
in
the
manner
they
do
,
that
they
be
not
handy
enough
to
make
the
necessary
they
want
;
and
that
,
have
no
help
,
they
find
they
should
be
starve
;
but
if
the
Spaniards
would
give
them
leave
to
take
one
of
the
canoe
which
they
come
over
in
,
and
give
them
arm
and
ammunition
proportion
for
their
defence
,
they
would
go
over
to
the
main
,
and
seek
their
fortune
,
and
so
deliver
them
from
the
trouble
of
supply
them
with
any
other
provision
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
be
glad
enough
to
be
rid
of
them
;
but
yet
very
honestly
represent
to
them
the
certain
destruction
they
be
run
into
;
tell
them
they
have
suffer
such
hardship
upon
that
very
spot
,
that
they
could
,
without
any
spirit
of
prophecy
,
tell
them
that
they
would
be
starve
or
murder
,
and
bade
them
consider
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
reply
audaciously
,
they
should
be
starve
if
they
stay
here
,
for
they
could
not
work
,
and
would
not
work
;
and
they
could
but
be
starve
abroad
;
and
if
they
be
murder
,
there
be
an
end
of
them
,
they
have
no
wife
or
child
to
cry
after
them
;
and
,
in
short
,
insist
importunately
upon
their
demand
,
declare
that
they
would
go
,
whether
they
would
give
them
any
arm
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
tell
them
with
great
kindness
,
that
if
they
be
resolve
to
go
,
they
should
not
go
like
naked
man
,
and
be
in
no
condition
to
defend
themselves
,
and
that
though
they
could
ill
spare
their
fire
-
arm
,
have
not
enough
for
themselves
,
yet
they
would
let
them
have
two
musket
,
a
pistol
,
and
a
cutlass
,
and
each
man
a
hatchet
,
which
they
think
sufficient
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
accept
the
offer
,
and
have
bake
them
bread
enough
to
serve
them
a
month
,
and
give
them
as
much
goat
's
flesh
as
they
could
eat
while
it
be
sweet
,
and
a
great
basket
full
of
dry
grape
,
a
pot
full
of
fresh
water
,
and
a
young
kid
alive
to
kill
,
they
boldly
set
out
in
a
canoe
for
a
voyage
over
the
sea
,
where
it
be
at
least
forty
mile
broad
.
  
<EOS>
the
boat
be
indeed
a
large
one
,
and
would
have
very
well
carry
fifteen
or
twenty
man
,
and
therefore
be
rather
too
big
for
them
to
manage
;
but
as
they
have
a
fair
breeze
and
the
flood
-
tide
with
them
,
they
do
well
enough
;
they
have
make
a
mast
of
a
long
pole
,
and
a
sail
of
four
large
goat
-
skin
dry
,
which
they
have
sew
or
lace
together
;
and
away
they
go
merrily
enough
;
the
Spaniards
call
after
them
,
"
bon
veajo
;
"
and
no
man
ever
think
of
see
them
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
would
often
say
to
one
another
,
and
the
two
honest
Englishmen
who
remain
behind
,
how
quietly
and
comfortably
they
live
now
<EOS>
those
three
turbulent
fellow
be
go
;
as
for
their
ever
come
again
,
that
be
the
remote
thing
from
their
thought
could
be
imagine
;
when
,
behold
,
after
twenty
-
two
day
absence
,
one
of
the
englishman
be
abroad
upon
his
planting
work
,
see
three
strange
man
come
towards
him
at
a
distance
,
two
of
them
with
gun
upon
their
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
away
run
the
Englishman
,
as
if
he
be
bewitch
,
and
become
frighted
and
amazed
,
to
the
governor
Spaniard
,
and
tell
him
they
be
all
undone
,
for
there
be
stranger
land
upon
the
island
<EOS>
,
he
could
not
tell
who
.
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
pause
a
while
,
say
to
him
,
"
how
do
you
mean
,
you
can
not
tell
who
?
<EOS>
They
be
savage
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
Englishman
,
"
they
be
man
in
clothe
,
with
arm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
then
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
"
why
be
you
concerned
?
<EOS>
if
they
be
not
savage
,
they
must
be
friend
;
for
there
be
no
christian
nation
upon
earth
but
will
do
us
good
rather
than
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
debate
thus
,
come
the
three
englishman
,
and
stand
without
the
wood
which
be
new
-
plant
,
halloo
to
them
<EOS>
;
they
presently
know
their
voice
,
and
so
all
the
wonder
of
that
kind
cease
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
admiration
be
turn
upon
another
question
,
viz
.
<EOS>
what
could
be
the
matter
,
and
what
make
them
come
back
again
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
they
bring
the
man
in
;
and
<EOS>
inquire
where
they
have
be
,
and
what
they
have
be
do
?
<EOS>
they
give
them
a
full
account
of
their
voyage
in
a
few
word
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
reach
the
land
in
two
day
,
or
something
less
,
but
find
the
people
alarm
at
their
come
,
and
prepare
with
bow
and
arrow
to
fight
them
,
they
durst
not
go
on
shore
,
but
sail
on
to
the
northward
six
or
seven
hour
,
till
they
come
to
a
great
opening
,
by
which
they
perceive
that
the
land
they
see
from
our
island
be
not
the
main
,
but
an
island
:
that
enter
that
opening
of
the
sea
,
they
see
another
island
on
the
right
hand
north
,
and
several
more
w
;
and
be
resolve
to
land
somewhere
,
they
put
over
to
one
of
the
island
which
lie
west
,
and
go
boldly
on
shore
;
that
they
find
the
people
be
courteous
and
friendly
to
them
,
and
they
give
them
several
root
,
and
some
dry
fish
,
and
appear
very
sociable
:
and
the
woman
,
as
well
as
the
man
,
be
very
forward
to
supply
them
with
any
thing
they
could
get
for
them
to
eat
,
and
bring
it
to
them
a
great
way
upon
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
They
continue
here
four
day
,
and
inquire
,
as
well
as
they
could
of
them
by
sign
,
what
nation
be
this
way
,
and
that
way
;
and
be
tell
of
several
fierce
and
terrible
people
,
that
live
almost
every
way
;
who
,
as
they
make
know
by
sign
to
them
,
use
to
eat
man
;
but
as
for
themselves
,
they
say
,
that
they
never
eat
man
or
woman
,
except
only
such
as
they
take
in
the
war
;
and
then
they
own
that
they
make
a
great
feast
,
and
eat
their
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
the
Englishmen
inquire
when
they
have
a
feast
of
that
kind
,
and
they
tell
them
two
moon
ago
,
point
to
the
moon
,
and
then
to
two
-
finger
;
and
that
their
great
king
have
two
hundred
prisoner
now
which
he
have
take
in
his
war
,
and
they
be
feed
them
to
make
them
fat
for
the
next
feast
.
<EOS>
the
Englishmen
seem
mighty
desirous
to
see
those
prisoner
,
but
the
other
mistake
them
,
think
they
be
desirous
to
have
some
of
them
to
carry
away
for
their
own
eating
.
<EOS>
so
they
beckon
to
them
,
point
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
,
and
then
to
the
rise
;
which
be
to
signify
,
that
the
next
morning
at
sun
-
rise
they
would
bring
some
for
them
;
and
accordingly
the
next
morning
they
bring
down
five
woman
and
eleven
man
,
and
give
them
to
the
Englishmen
to
carry
with
them
on
their
voyage
,
just
as
we
would
bring
so
many
cow
and
oxen
down
to
a
sea
-
port
town
to
victual
a
ship
.
  
<EOS>
as
brutish
and
barbarous
as
these
fellow
be
at
home
,
their
stomach
turn
at
this
sight
,
and
they
do
not
know
what
to
do
;
to
refuse
the
prisoner
would
have
be
the
high
affront
to
the
savage
gentry
that
offer
them
;
and
what
to
do
with
them
they
know
not
;
however
,
upon
some
debate
,
they
resolve
to
accept
of
them
;
and
in
return
they
give
the
savage
that
bring
them
one
of
their
hatchet
,
an
old
key
,
a
knife
,
and
six
or
seven
of
their
bullet
,
which
,
though
they
do
not
understand
,
they
seem
extremely
pleased
with
;
and
then
tie
the
poor
creature
'
hand
behind
them
,
they
(
the
people
)
drag
the
prisoner
into
the
boat
for
our
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
englishman
be
oblige
to
come
away
as
soon
as
they
have
them
,
or
else
<EOS>
they
that
give
them
his
noble
present
would
certainly
have
expect
that
they
should
have
go
to
work
with
them
,
have
kill
two
or
three
of
them
the
next
morning
,
and
perhaps
have
invite
the
donor
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
but
have
take
their
leave
with
all
the
respect
and
thank
that
could
well
pass
between
people
,
where
,
on
either
side
,
they
understand
not
one
word
they
could
say
,
they
put
off
with
their
boat
,
and
come
back
towards
the
first
island
,
where
when
they
arrive
,
they
set
eight
of
their
prisoner
at
liberty
,
there
be
too
many
of
them
for
their
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
in
their
voyage
they
endeavour
to
have
some
communication
with
their
prisoner
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
make
them
understand
any
thing
;
nothing
they
could
say
to
them
,
or
give
them
,
or
do
for
them
,
but
be
look
upon
as
go
about
to
murder
them
:
they
first
of
all
unbound
them
,
but
the
poor
creature
scream
at
that
,
especially
the
woman
,
as
if
they
have
just
feel
the
knife
at
their
throat
;
for
they
immediately
conclude
they
be
unbound
on
purpose
to
be
kill
.
  
<EOS>
if
they
give
them
any
thing
to
eat
,
it
be
the
same
thing
;
then
they
conclude
it
be
for
fear
they
should
sink
in
flesh
,
and
so
not
be
fat
enough
to
kill
;
if
they
look
at
one
of
them
more
particularly
,
the
party
presently
conclude
it
be
to
see
whether
he
or
she
be
fat
and
fit
to
kill
first
;
nay
,
after
they
have
bring
them
quite
over
,
and
begin
to
use
them
kindly
and
treat
them
well
,
still
they
expect
every
day
to
make
a
dinner
or
supper
for
their
new
master
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
three
wanderer
have
give
this
unaccountable
history
or
journal
of
their
voyage
,
the
Spaniard
ask
them
where
their
new
family
be
?
<EOS>
and
be
tell
that
they
have
bring
them
on
shore
,
and
put
them
into
one
of
their
hut
,
and
be
come
to
beg
some
victual
for
them
;
they
(
the
Spaniards
)
and
the
other
two
englishman
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
whole
colony
,
resolve
to
go
all
down
to
the
place
and
see
them
,
and
do
so
,
and
Friday
's
father
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
into
the
hut
,
there
they
sit
all
bind
;
for
when
they
have
bring
them
on
shore
they
bind
their
hand
,
that
they
may
not
take
the
boat
and
make
their
escape
;
there
,
I
say
,
they
sit
all
of
them
stark
naked
.
<EOS>
first
,
there
be
three
man
,
lusty
,
comely
fellow
,
well
shaped
,
straight
and
fair
limb
,
about
thirty
or
thirty
-
five
year
of
age
,
and
five
woman
;
whereof
two
may
be
from
thirty
to
forty
,
two
more
not
above
twenty
-
four
or
twenty
-
five
,
and
the
fifth
,
a
tall
,
comely
maiden
,
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
.
<EOS>
the
woman
be
well
-
favour
,
agreeable
person
,
both
in
shape
and
feature
,
only
tawny
;
and
two
of
them
,
have
they
be
perfect
white
,
would
have
pass
for
handsome
woman
,
even
in
London
itself
,
have
very
pleasant
,
agreeable
countenance
,
and
of
a
very
modest
behaviour
,
especially
when
they
come
afterwards
to
be
clothe
,
and
dress
,
as
they
call
it
,
though
that
dress
be
very
indifferent
it
must
be
confess
,
of
which
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
the
sight
,
you
may
be
sure
,
be
something
uncouth
to
our
Spaniards
,
who
be
(
to
give
them
a
just
character
)
<EOS>
man
of
the
good
behaviour
,
of
the
most
calm
,
sedate
temper
,
and
perfect
good
humour
that
ever
I
meet
with
;
and
,
in
particular
,
of
the
most
modesty
,
as
will
presently
appear
<EOS>
:
I
say
the
sight
be
very
uncouth
,
to
see
three
naked
man
and
five
naked
woman
,
all
together
bind
,
and
in
the
most
miserable
circumstance
that
human
nature
could
be
suppose
to
be
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
be
expect
every
moment
to
be
drag
out
,
and
have
their
brain
knock
out
,
and
then
to
be
eat
up
like
a
calf
that
be
kill
for
a
dainty
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
they
do
be
to
cause
the
old
Indian
,
Friday
's
father
,
to
go
in
and
see
first
if
he
know
any
of
them
,
and
then
if
he
understand
any
of
their
speech
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
old
man
come
in
,
he
look
seriously
at
them
,
but
know
none
of
them
;
neither
could
any
of
them
understand
a
word
he
say
,
or
a
sign
he
could
make
,
except
one
of
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
enough
to
answer
the
end
,
which
be
to
satisfy
them
,
that
the
man
into
whose
hand
they
be
fall
be
Christians
;
that
they
abhor
eat
of
man
or
woman
,
and
that
they
may
be
sure
they
would
not
be
kill
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
assure
of
this
,
they
discover
such
a
joy
,
and
by
such
awkward
and
several
way
as
be
hard
to
describe
,
for
it
seem
they
be
of
several
nation
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
who
be
their
interpreter
be
bid
,
in
the
next
place
,
to
ask
them
if
they
be
willing
to
be
servant
,
and
to
work
for
the
man
who
have
bring
them
away
to
save
their
life
?
<EOS>
at
which
they
all
fall
a
dancing
;
and
presently
one
fall
to
take
up
this
,
and
another
that
,
any
thing
that
lie
next
,
to
carry
on
their
shoulder
,
to
intimate
that
they
be
willing
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
,
who
find
that
the
have
woman
among
them
would
presently
be
attend
with
some
inconveniency
,
and
may
occasion
some
strife
,
and
perhaps
blood
,
ask
the
three
man
what
they
intend
to
do
with
these
woman
,
and
how
they
intend
to
use
them
,
whether
as
servant
or
as
woman
?
<EOS>
one
of
the
Englishmen
answer
very
boldly
and
readily
,
that
they
would
use
them
as
both
.
<EOS>
to
which
the
governor
say
,
"
I
be
not
go
to
restrain
you
from
it
;
you
be
your
own
master
as
to
that
:
<EOS>
but
this
I
think
be
but
just
,
for
avoid
disorder
and
quarrel
among
you
,
and
I
desire
it
of
you
for
that
reason
only
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
you
will
all
engage
,
that
if
any
of
you
take
any
of
these
woman
as
a
woman
,
or
wife
,
he
shall
take
but
one
;
and
that
,
have
take
one
,
none
else
should
touch
her
;
for
though
we
can
not
marry
any
of
you
,
yet
it
be
but
reasonable
that
while
you
stay
here
,
the
woman
any
of
you
take
should
be
maintain
by
the
man
that
take
her
,
and
should
be
his
wife
;
I
mean
,
"
say
he
,
"
while
he
continue
here
;
and
that
none
else
should
have
any
thing
to
do
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
all
this
appear
so
just
,
that
every
one
agree
to
it
without
any
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
Englishmen
ask
the
Spaniards
if
they
design
to
take
any
of
them
?
<EOS>
but
every
one
answer
,
"
no
;
"
some
of
them
say
they
have
wife
in
Spain
;
and
the
other
do
not
like
woman
that
be
not
Christians
;
and
all
together
declare
,
that
they
would
not
touch
one
of
them
;
which
be
an
instance
of
such
virtue
as
I
have
not
meet
with
in
all
my
travel
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
to
be
short
,
the
five
Englishmen
take
them
every
one
a
wife
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
temporary
wife
;
and
so
they
set
up
a
new
form
of
living
;
for
the
Spaniards
and
Friday
's
father
live
in
my
old
habitation
,
which
they
have
enlarge
exceedingly
within
;
the
three
servant
,
which
they
have
take
in
the
late
battle
of
the
savage
,
live
with
them
;
and
these
carry
on
the
main
part
of
the
colony
,
supply
all
the
rest
with
food
,
and
assist
them
in
any
thing
as
they
could
,
or
as
they
find
necessity
require
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
wonder
of
this
story
be
,
how
five
such
refractory
,
ill
-
match
fellow
should
agree
about
these
woman
,
and
that
two
of
them
should
not
pitch
upon
the
same
woman
,
especially
see
two
or
three
of
them
be
,
without
comparison
,
more
agreeable
than
the
other
:
but
they
take
a
good
way
enough
to
prevent
quarrelling
among
themselves
;
for
they
set
the
five
woman
by
themselves
in
one
of
their
hut
,
and
they
go
all
into
the
other
hut
,
and
draw
lot
among
them
who
should
choose
first
.
  
<EOS>
He
that
draw
to
choose
first
,
go
away
by
himself
to
the
hut
where
the
poor
naked
creature
be
,
and
fetch
out
her
he
choose
;
and
it
be
worth
observe
that
he
that
choose
first
take
her
that
be
reckon
the
homely
and
the
old
of
the
five
,
which
make
mirth
enough
among
the
rest
;
and
even
the
Spaniards
laugh
at
it
;
but
the
fellow
consider
better
than
any
of
them
,
that
it
be
application
and
business
that
they
be
to
expect
assistance
in
as
much
as
any
thing
else
,
and
she
prove
the
good
wife
in
the
parcel
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
poor
woman
see
themselves
in
a
row
thus
,
and
fetch
out
one
by
one
,
the
terror
of
their
condition
return
upon
them
again
,
and
they
firmly
believe
that
they
be
now
go
to
be
devour
:
accordingly
,
when
the
english
sailor
come
in
and
fetch
out
one
of
them
,
the
rest
set
up
a
most
lamentable
cry
,
and
hang
about
her
,
and
take
their
leave
of
her
with
such
agony
and
such
affection
as
would
have
grieve
the
hard
heart
in
the
world
;
nor
be
it
possible
for
the
Englishmen
to
satisfy
them
that
they
be
not
to
be
immediately
murder
,
till
they
fetch
the
old
man
,
Friday
's
father
,
who
instantly
let
them
know
,
that
the
five
man
who
have
fetch
them
out
one
by
one
,
have
choose
them
for
their
wife
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
do
this
,
and
the
fright
the
woman
be
in
be
a
little
over
,
the
man
go
to
work
,
and
the
Spaniards
come
and
help
them
;
and
in
a
few
hour
they
have
build
them
every
one
<EOS>
a
new
hut
or
tent
for
their
lodging
apart
;
for
those
they
have
already
be
crowd
with
their
tool
,
household
stuff
,
and
provision
.
<EOS>
the
three
wicked
one
have
pitch
farth
off
,
and
the
two
honest
one
nearer
,
but
both
on
the
north
shore
of
the
island
,
so
that
they
continue
separate
as
before
:
and
thus
my
island
be
people
in
three
place
,
and
,
as
I
may
say
,
three
town
be
begin
to
be
plant
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
it
be
very
well
worth
observe
,
that
as
it
often
happen
in
the
world
,
(
what
the
wise
end
of
God
's
providence
be
in
such
a
disposition
of
thing
I
can
not
say
)
<EOS>
the
two
honest
fellow
have
the
two
bad
wife
;
and
the
three
reprobate
,
that
be
scarce
worth
hang
,
that
be
fit
for
nothing
,
and
neither
seem
bear
to
do
themselves
good
,
or
any
one
else
,
have
three
clever
,
diligent
,
careful
,
and
ingenious
wife
,
not
that
the
two
first
be
ill
wife
as
to
their
temper
or
humour
;
for
all
the
five
be
most
willing
,
quiet
,
passive
,
and
subject
creature
,
rather
like
slave
than
wife
;
but
my
meaning
be
,
they
be
not
alike
,
capable
,
ingenious
,
or
industrious
,
or
alike
cleanly
and
neat
.
  
<EOS>
another
observation
I
must
make
,
to
the
honour
of
a
diligent
application
on
the
one
hand
,
and
to
the
disgrace
of
a
slothful
,
negligent
,
idle
temper
on
the
other
,
<EOS>
that
when
I
come
to
the
place
,
and
view
the
several
improvement
,
planting
,
and
management
of
the
several
little
colony
,
the
two
man
have
so
far
out
-
go
the
three
<EOS>
,
that
there
be
no
comparison
;
they
have
indeed
both
of
them
as
much
ground
lay
out
for
corn
as
they
want
;
and
the
reason
be
,
because
accord
to
my
rule
,
nature
dictate
,
that
it
be
to
no
purpose
to
sow
more
corn
than
they
want
;
but
the
difference
of
the
cultivation
,
of
the
planting
,
of
the
fence
,
and
indeed
every
thing
else
,
be
easy
to
be
see
at
first
view
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
have
innumerable
young
tree
plant
about
their
hut
,
that
when
you
come
to
the
place
nothing
be
to
be
see
but
a
wood
;
and
though
they
have
their
plantation
twice
demolish
,
once
by
their
own
countryman
,
and
once
by
the
enemy
,
as
shall
be
shew
in
its
place
;
yet
they
have
restore
all
again
,
and
every
thing
be
flourish
and
thrive
about
them
:
they
have
grape
plant
in
order
,
and
manage
like
a
vineyard
,
though
they
have
themselves
never
see
any
thing
of
that
kind
;
and
by
their
good
order
their
vine
their
grape
be
as
good
again
as
any
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
have
also
form
themselves
a
retreat
in
the
thick
part
of
the
wood
,
where
,
though
there
be
not
a
natural
cave
,
as
I
have
find
,
yet
they
make
one
with
incessant
labour
of
their
hand
,
and
where
,
when
the
mischief
which
follow
happen
,
they
secure
their
wife
and
child
so
as
they
could
never
be
find
;
they
have
,
by
stick
innumerable
stake
and
pole
of
the
wood
,
which
,
as
I
say
,
grow
so
easily
,
make
a
grove
impassable
except
in
one
place
,
where
they
climb
up
to
get
over
the
outside
part
,
and
then
go
in
by
way
of
their
own
leaving
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
three
reprobate
,
as
I
justly
call
them
,
though
they
be
much
civilized
by
their
new
settlement
compare
to
what
they
be
before
,
and
be
not
so
quarrelsome
,
have
not
the
same
opportunity
,
yet
one
of
the
certain
companion
of
a
profligate
mind
never
leave
them
,
and
that
be
their
idleness
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
they
plant
corn
and
make
fence
;
but
Solomon
's
word
be
never
better
verify
than
in
them
:
"
<EOS>
I
go
by
the
vineyard
of
the
slothful
,
and
it
be
overgrow
with
thorn
;
"
for
when
the
Spaniards
come
to
view
their
crop
,
they
could
not
see
it
in
some
place
for
weed
;
the
hedge
have
several
gap
in
it
,
where
the
wild
goat
have
get
in
and
eaten
up
the
corn
;
perhaps
here
and
there
a
dead
bush
be
cram
in
to
stop
them
out
for
the
present
,
but
it
be
only
shut
the
stable
door
after
the
steed
be
steal
;
whereas
,
when
they
look
on
the
colony
of
the
other
two
,
here
be
the
very
face
of
industry
and
success
upon
all
they
do
;
there
be
not
a
weed
to
be
see
in
all
their
corn
,
or
a
gap
in
any
of
their
hedge
;
and
they
,
on
the
other
hand
,
verify
Solomon
's
word
in
another
place
:
"
the
diligent
hand
maketh
rich
;
"
for
every
thing
grow
and
thrive
,
and
they
have
plenty
within
and
without
;
they
have
more
tame
cattle
than
the
other
,
more
utensil
and
necessary
within
door
,
and
yet
more
pleasure
and
diversion
too
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
the
wife
of
the
three
be
very
handy
and
cleanly
within
door
;
and
have
learn
the
english
way
of
dress
and
cook
from
one
of
the
other
Englishmen
,
who
,
as
I
say
,
be
a
cook
's
mate
on
board
the
ship
,
they
dress
their
husband
'
victual
very
nicely
;
whereas
the
other
could
not
be
bring
to
understand
it
;
but
then
the
husband
,
who
as
I
say
,
have
be
cook
's
mate
,
do
it
himself
;
but
as
for
the
husband
of
the
three
wife
,
they
loiter
about
,
fetched
turtle
'
egg
,
and
catch
fish
and
bird
;
in
a
word
,
any
thing
but
labour
,
and
they
fare
accordingly
.
<EOS>
the
diligent
live
well
and
comfortably
and
the
slothful
live
hard
and
beggarly
;
and
so
I
believe
,
generally
speak
<EOS>
,
it
be
all
over
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
I
come
to
a
scene
different
from
all
that
have
happen
before
,
either
to
them
or
me
;
and
the
origin
of
the
story
be
this
:
  
<EOS>
early
one
morning
there
come
on
shore
five
or
six
canoe
of
Indians
,
or
savage
,
call
them
which
you
please
;
and
there
be
no
room
to
doubt
that
they
come
upon
the
old
errand
of
feed
upon
their
slave
;
but
that
part
be
now
so
familiar
to
the
Spaniards
,
and
to
our
man
too
,
that
they
do
not
concern
themselves
about
it
as
I
do
;
but
have
be
make
sensible
by
their
experience
,
that
their
only
business
be
to
lie
conceal
,
and
that
,
if
they
be
not
see
by
any
of
the
savage
,
they
would
go
off
again
quietly
when
the
business
be
do
,
have
as
yet
not
the
least
notion
of
there
be
any
inhabitant
in
the
island
;
I
say
have
be
make
sensible
of
this
,
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
notice
to
all
the
three
plantation
to
keep
within
door
,
and
not
to
shew
themselves
;
only
place
a
scout
in
a
proper
place
,
to
give
notice
when
the
boat
go
off
to
sea
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
without
doubt
,
very
right
;
but
a
disaster
spoil
all
these
measure
,
and
make
it
known
among
the
savage
that
there
be
inhabitant
there
,
which
be
,
in
the
end
,
the
desolation
of
almost
the
whole
colony
.
<EOS>
after
the
canoe
with
the
savage
be
go
off
,
the
Spaniards
peep
abroad
again
,
and
some
of
them
have
the
curiosity
to
go
to
the
place
where
they
have
be
,
to
see
what
they
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
here
,
to
their
great
surprise
,
they
find
three
savage
leave
behind
,
and
lie
fast
asleep
upon
the
ground
;
it
be
suppose
they
have
either
be
so
gorged
with
their
inhuman
feast
,
that
,
like
beast
,
they
be
asleep
,
and
would
not
stir
when
the
other
go
,
or
they
be
wander
into
the
wood
,
and
do
not
come
back
in
time
to
be
take
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
be
greatly
surprised
at
this
sight
,
and
perfectly
at
a
loss
what
to
do
;
the
Spaniard
governor
,
as
it
happen
,
be
with
them
,
and
his
advice
be
ask
;
but
he
profess
he
know
not
what
to
do
;
as
for
slave
,
they
have
enough
already
;
and
as
to
kill
them
,
they
be
none
of
them
incline
to
that
.
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
governor
tell
me
they
could
not
think
of
shed
innocent
blood
;
for
as
to
them
,
the
poor
creature
have
do
no
wrong
,
invade
none
of
their
property
;
and
they
think
they
have
no
just
quarrel
against
them
to
take
away
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
,
in
justice
to
these
Spaniards
,
observe
,
that
let
all
the
account
of
spanish
cruelty
in
Mexico
and
Peru
be
what
they
will
<EOS>
,
I
never
meet
with
seventeen
man
,
of
any
nation
whatsoever
,
in
any
foreign
country
,
who
be
so
universally
modest
,
temperate
,
virtuous
,
so
very
good
-
humoured
,
and
so
courteous
as
these
Spaniards
;
and
,
as
to
cruelty
,
they
have
nothing
of
it
in
their
very
nature
;
no
inhumanity
,
no
barbarity
,
no
outrageous
passion
,
and
yet
all
of
them
man
of
great
courage
and
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Their
temper
and
calmness
have
appear
in
their
bearing
the
insufferable
usage
of
the
three
Englishmen
;
and
their
justice
and
humanity
appear
now
in
the
case
of
the
savage
as
above
.
<EOS>
after
some
consultation
they
resolve
upon
this
,
that
they
would
lie
still
a
while
longer
,
till
,
if
possible
,
these
three
man
may
be
go
;
but
then
the
governor
Spaniard
recollect
that
the
three
savage
have
no
boat
;
and
that
if
they
be
leave
to
rove
about
the
island
,
they
would
certainly
discover
that
there
be
inhabitant
in
it
,
and
so
they
should
be
undo
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
they
go
back
again
,
and
there
lie
the
fellow
fast
asleep
still
;
so
they
resolve
to
awaken
them
,
and
take
them
prisoner
;
and
they
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
be
strangely
fright
when
they
be
seize
upon
and
bind
,
and
afraid
,
like
the
woman
,
that
they
should
be
murder
and
eat
;
for
it
seem
those
people
think
all
the
world
do
as
they
do
,
eat
men
'
flesh
;
but
they
be
soon
make
easy
as
to
that
:
and
away
they
carry
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
happy
for
them
that
they
do
not
carry
them
home
to
their
castle
;
I
mean
to
my
palace
under
the
hill
;
but
they
carry
them
first
to
the
bower
,
where
be
the
chief
of
their
country
work
;
such
as
the
keep
the
goat
,
the
planting
the
corn
,
&
c.
;
and
afterwards
they
carry
them
to
the
habitation
of
the
two
englishman
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
be
set
to
work
,
though
it
be
not
much
,
they
have
for
them
to
do
;
and
whether
it
be
by
negligence
in
guard
them
,
or
that
they
think
the
fellow
could
not
mend
themselves
,
I
know
not
,
but
one
of
them
run
away
,
and
take
into
the
wood
,
they
could
never
hear
of
him
more
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
good
reason
to
believe
he
get
home
again
soon
after
in
some
other
boat
or
canoe
of
savage
,
who
come
on
shore
three
or
four
week
afterwards
,
and
who
,
carry
on
their
revel
as
usual
,
go
off
again
in
two
day
time
.
<EOS>
this
thought
terrify
them
exceedingly
;
for
they
conclude
,
and
that
not
without
good
cause
<EOS>
indeed
,
that
if
this
fellow
get
safe
home
among
his
comrade
,
he
would
certainly
give
them
an
account
that
there
be
people
in
the
island
,
as
also
how
weak
and
few
they
be
;
for
this
savage
,
as
I
observe
before
,
have
never
be
tell
,
as
it
be
very
happy
<EOS>
he
have
not
,
how
many
they
be
,
or
where
they
live
,
nor
have
he
ever
see
or
hear
the
fire
of
any
of
their
gun
,
much
less
<EOS>
have
they
shew
him
any
other
of
their
retire
place
,
such
as
the
cave
in
the
valley
,
or
the
new
retreat
which
the
two
englishman
have
make
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
testimony
they
have
that
this
fellow
have
give
intelligence
of
them
be
,
that
about
two
month
after
this
,
six
canoe
of
savage
,
with
about
seven
or
eight
,
or
ten
man
in
a
canoe
,
come
row
along
the
north
side
of
the
island
,
where
they
never
use
to
come
before
,
and
land
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
,
at
a
convenient
place
,
about
a
mile
from
the
habitation
of
the
two
englishman
,
where
this
escape
man
have
be
keep
.
<EOS>
as
the
Spaniard
governor
say
,
have
they
be
all
there
<EOS>
the
damage
would
not
have
be
so
much
,
for
not
a
man
of
them
would
have
escape
:
but
the
case
differ
now
very
much
;
for
two
man
to
fifty
be
too
much
odd
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
have
the
happiness
to
discover
them
about
a
league
off
,
so
that
it
be
about
an
hour
before
they
land
,
and
as
they
land
about
a
mile
from
their
hut
,
it
be
some
time
before
they
could
come
at
them
.
<EOS>
now
have
great
reason
to
believe
that
they
be
betray
,
the
first
thing
they
do
be
to
bind
the
slave
which
be
leave
,
and
cause
two
of
the
three
man
whom
they
bring
with
the
woman
,
who
,
it
seem
,
prove
very
faithful
to
them
,
to
lead
them
with
their
two
wife
,
and
whatever
they
could
carry
away
with
them
,
to
their
retired
place
in
the
wood
,
which
I
have
speak
of
above
,
and
there
to
bind
the
two
fellow
hand
and
foot
till
they
hear
farther
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
see
the
savage
be
all
come
on
shore
,
and
that
they
bend
their
course
directly
that
way
,
they
open
the
fence
where
their
milch
-
goat
be
keep
,
and
drive
them
all
out
,
leave
their
goat
to
straggle
into
the
wood
,
whither
they
please
,
that
the
savage
may
think
they
be
all
breed
wild
;
but
the
rogue
who
come
with
them
be
too
cunning
for
that
,
and
give
them
an
account
of
it
all
,
for
they
go
directly
to
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
poor
fright
man
have
secure
their
wife
and
good
,
they
send
the
other
slave
they
have
of
the
three
,
who
come
with
the
woman
,
and
who
be
at
their
place
by
accident
,
away
to
the
Spaniards
with
all
speed
,
to
give
them
the
alarm
,
and
desire
speedy
help
;
and
in
the
mean
time
they
take
their
arm
,
and
what
ammunition
they
have
,
and
retreat
towards
the
place
in
the
wood
where
their
wife
be
send
,
keep
at
a
distance
;
yet
so
that
they
may
see
,
if
possible
,
which
way
the
savage
take
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
far
but
that
,
from
a
rise
ground
,
they
could
see
the
little
army
of
their
enemy
come
on
directly
to
their
habitation
,
and
in
a
moment
more
could
see
all
their
hut
and
household
-
stuff
flame
up
together
,
to
their
great
grief
and
mortification
;
for
they
have
a
very
great
loss
,
and
to
them
irretrievable
,
at
least
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
They
keep
their
station
for
a
while
,
till
they
find
the
savage
,
like
wild
beast
,
spread
themselves
all
over
the
place
,
rummage
every
way
,
and
every
place
they
could
think
of
,
in
search
for
prey
,
and
in
particular
for
the
people
,
of
whom
it
plainly
appear
they
have
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
englishman
,
see
this
,
think
themselves
not
secure
where
they
stand
,
as
it
be
likely
some
of
the
wild
people
may
come
that
way
,
so
they
may
come
too
many
together
,
think
it
proper
to
make
another
retreat
about
half
a
mile
farther
,
believe
,
as
it
afterwards
happen
,
that
the
farther
they
stroll
,
the
few
would
be
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
halt
be
at
the
entrance
into
a
very
thick
grown
part
of
the
wood
,
and
where
an
old
trunk
of
a
tree
stand
,
which
be
hollow
,
and
vastly
large
;
and
in
this
tree
they
both
take
their
standing
,
resolve
to
see
what
may
offer
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
stand
there
long
,
but
two
of
the
savage
appear
run
directly
that
way
,
as
if
they
have
already
notice
where
they
stand
,
and
be
come
up
to
attack
them
;
and
a
little
way
farther
they
espy
three
more
come
after
them
,
and
five
more
beyond
them
,
all
come
the
same
way
;
besides
which
,
they
see
seven
or
eight
more
at
a
distance
,
run
another
way
;
for
,
in
a
word
,
they
run
every
way
,
like
sportsman
beat
for
their
game
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
man
be
now
in
great
perplexity
,
whether
they
should
stand
and
keep
their
posture
,
or
fly
;
but
after
a
very
short
debate
with
themselves
,
they
consider
that
if
the
savage
range
the
country
thus
before
help
come
,
they
may
,
perhaps
,
find
out
their
retreat
in
the
wood
,
and
then
all
would
be
lose
;
so
they
resolve
to
stand
them
there
;
and
if
there
be
too
many
to
deal
with
,
then
they
would
get
to
the
top
of
the
tree
,
from
whence
they
doubt
not
to
defend
themselves
,
fire
except
,
as
long
as
their
ammunition
last
,
though
all
the
savage
that
be
land
,
which
be
near
fifty
,
be
to
attack
them
.
  
<EOS>
have
resolve
upon
this
,
they
next
consider
whether
they
should
fire
at
the
two
first
,
or
wait
for
the
three
,
and
so
take
the
middle
party
,
by
which
the
two
and
the
five
that
follow
would
be
separate
:
at
length
they
resolve
to
let
the
two
first
pass
by
,
unless
they
should
spy
them
in
the
tree
,
and
come
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
the
two
first
savage
also
confirm
them
in
this
resolution
,
by
turn
a
little
from
them
towards
another
part
of
the
wood
;
but
the
three
,
and
the
five
after
them
,
come
forwards
directly
to
the
tree
,
as
if
they
have
know
the
Englishmen
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
see
them
come
so
straight
towards
them
,
they
resolve
to
take
them
in
a
line
as
they
come
;
and
as
they
resolve
to
fire
but
one
at
a
time
,
perhaps
the
first
shot
may
hit
them
all
three
;
to
which
purpose
,
the
man
who
be
to
fire
put
three
or
four
bullet
into
his
piece
,
and
have
a
fair
loop
-
hole
,
as
it
be
,
from
a
broken
hole
in
the
tree
,
he
take
a
sure
aim
,
without
be
see
,
wait
till
they
be
within
about
thirty
yard
of
the
tree
,
so
that
he
could
not
miss
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
thus
wait
,
and
the
savage
come
on
,
they
plainly
see
,
that
one
of
the
three
be
the
runaway
savage
that
have
escape
from
them
;
and
they
both
know
him
distinctly
,
and
resolve
that
,
if
possible
,
he
should
not
escape
,
though
they
should
both
fire
;
so
the
other
stand
ready
with
his
piece
,
that
if
he
do
not
drop
at
the
first
shot
,
he
should
be
sure
to
have
a
second
.
<EOS>
but
the
first
be
too
good
a
marksman
to
miss
his
aim
;
for
as
the
savage
keep
near
one
another
,
a
little
behind
in
a
line
,
he
fire
,
and
hit
two
of
them
directly
;
the
foremost
be
kill
outright
,
be
shoot
in
the
head
;
the
second
,
which
be
the
runaway
Indian
,
be
shoot
through
the
body
,
and
fall
,
but
be
not
quite
dead
;
and
the
third
have
a
little
scratch
in
the
shoulder
,
perhaps
by
the
same
ball
that
go
through
the
body
of
the
second
;
and
be
dreadfully
frightened
,
though
not
so
much
hurt
,
sit
down
upon
the
ground
,
scream
and
yell
in
a
hideous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
five
that
be
behind
,
more
frightened
with
the
noise
than
sensible
of
the
danger
,
stand
still
at
first
;
for
the
wood
make
the
sound
a
thousand
time
big
than
it
really
be
,
the
echo
rattle
from
one
side
to
another
,
and
the
fowl
rise
from
all
part
,
scream
,
and
every
sort
make
a
different
noise
,
accord
to
their
kind
;
just
as
it
be
when
I
fire
the
first
gun
that
perhaps
be
ever
shoot
off
in
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
all
be
silent
again
,
and
they
not
know
what
the
matter
be
,
come
on
unconcerned
,
till
they
come
to
the
place
where
their
companion
lie
in
a
condition
miserable
enough
.
<EOS>
here
the
poor
ignorant
creature
,
not
sensible
that
they
be
within
reach
of
the
same
mischief
,
stand
all
together
over
the
wounded
man
,
talk
,
and
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
inquire
of
him
how
he
come
to
be
hurt
;
and
who
,
it
be
very
rational
to
believe
,
tell
them
that
a
flash
of
fire
first
,
and
immediately
after
that
thunder
from
their
god
,
have
kill
those
two
and
wound
him
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
be
rational
;
for
nothing
be
more
certain
than
that
,
as
they
see
no
man
near
them
,
so
they
have
never
hear
a
gun
in
all
their
life
,
nor
so
much
as
hear
of
a
gun
;
neither
know
they
anything
of
kill
and
wound
at
a
distance
with
fire
and
bullet
:
if
they
have
,
one
may
reasonably
believe
they
would
not
have
stand
so
unconcerned
to
view
the
fate
of
their
fellow
,
without
some
apprehension
of
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
Our
two
man
,
as
they
confess
to
me
,
be
grieve
to
be
oblige
to
kill
so
many
poor
creature
,
who
have
no
notion
of
their
danger
;
yet
,
have
them
all
thus
in
their
power
,
and
the
first
have
load
his
piece
again
,
resolve
to
let
fly
both
together
among
them
;
and
single
out
,
by
agreement
,
which
to
aim
at
,
they
shoot
together
,
and
kill
,
or
very
much
wound
,
four
of
them
;
the
fifth
,
frighten
even
to
death
,
though
not
hurt
,
fall
with
the
rest
;
so
that
our
man
,
see
them
all
fall
together
,
think
they
have
kill
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
belief
that
the
savage
be
all
kill
make
our
two
man
come
boldly
out
from
the
tree
before
they
have
charge
their
gun
,
which
be
a
wrong
step
;
and
they
be
under
some
surprise
when
they
come
to
the
place
,
and
find
no
less
than
four
of
them
alive
,
and
of
them
two
very
little
hurt
,
and
one
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
this
oblige
them
to
fall
upon
them
with
the
stock
of
their
musket
;
and
first
they
make
sure
of
the
runaway
savage
,
that
have
be
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
,
and
of
another
that
be
hurt
in
the
knee
,
and
put
them
out
of
their
pain
;
then
the
man
that
be
not
hurt
at
all
come
and
kneel
down
to
them
,
with
his
two
hand
hold
up
,
and
make
piteous
moan
to
them
,
by
gesture
and
sign
,
for
his
life
,
but
could
not
say
one
word
to
them
that
they
could
understand
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
make
sign
to
him
to
sit
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
hard
by
;
and
one
of
the
Englishmen
,
with
a
piece
of
rope
-
yarn
,
which
he
have
by
great
chance
in
his
pocket
,
tie
his
two
hand
behind
him
,
and
there
they
leave
him
;
and
with
what
speed
they
could
make
after
the
other
two
,
which
be
go
before
,
fear
they
,
or
any
more
of
them
,
should
find
the
way
to
their
covered
place
in
the
wood
,
where
their
wife
,
and
the
few
good
they
have
leave
,
lie
.
<EOS>
They
come
once
in
sight
of
the
two
man
,
but
it
be
at
a
great
distance
;
however
,
they
have
the
satisfaction
to
see
them
cross
over
a
valley
towards
the
sea
,
the
quite
contrary
way
from
that
which
lead
to
their
retreat
,
which
they
be
afraid
of
;
and
be
satisfied
with
that
,
they
go
back
to
the
tree
where
they
leave
their
prisoner
,
who
as
they
suppose
be
deliver
by
his
comrade
;
for
he
be
go
,
and
the
two
piece
of
rope
-
yarn
with
which
they
have
bind
him
,
lie
just
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
in
as
great
a
concern
as
before
,
not
know
what
course
to
take
,
or
how
near
the
enemy
may
be
,
or
in
what
number
;
so
they
resolve
to
go
away
to
the
place
where
their
wife
be
,
to
see
if
all
be
well
there
,
and
to
make
them
easy
,
who
be
in
fright
enough
to
be
sure
;
for
though
the
savage
be
their
own
country
-
folk
,
yet
they
be
most
terribly
afraid
of
them
,
and
perhaps
the
more
,
for
the
knowledge
they
have
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
thither
,
they
find
the
savage
have
be
in
the
wood
,
and
very
near
the
place
,
but
have
not
find
it
;
for
indeed
it
be
inaccessible
,
by
the
tree
stand
so
thick
,
as
before
,
unless
the
person
seek
it
have
be
direct
by
those
that
know
it
,
which
these
be
not
;
they
find
,
therefore
,
every
thing
very
safe
,
only
the
woman
in
a
terrible
fright
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
here
they
have
the
comfort
of
seven
of
the
Spaniards
come
to
their
assistance
:
<EOS>
the
other
ten
with
their
servant
,
and
old
Friday
,
I
mean
Friday
's
father
,
be
go
in
a
body
to
defend
their
bower
,
and
the
corn
and
cattle
that
be
keep
there
,
in
case
the
savage
should
have
rove
over
to
that
side
of
the
country
;
but
they
do
not
spread
so
far
.
<EOS>
with
the
seven
Spaniards
come
one
of
the
savage
,
who
,
as
I
say
,
be
their
prisoner
formerly
,
and
with
them
also
come
the
savage
whom
the
Englishmen
have
leave
bind
hand
and
foot
at
the
tree
;
for
it
seem
they
come
that
way
,
see
the
slaughter
of
the
seven
man
,
and
unbound
the
eighth
,
and
bring
him
along
with
them
,
where
,
however
,
they
be
oblige
to
bind
him
again
,
us
they
have
do
the
two
other
,
who
be
leave
when
the
third
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
prisoner
begin
now
to
be
a
burden
to
them
;
and
they
be
so
afraid
of
their
escaping
,
that
they
think
they
be
under
an
absolute
necessity
to
kill
them
for
their
own
preservation
:
<EOS>
however
,
the
Spaniard
governor
would
not
consent
to
it
;
but
order
,
that
they
should
be
send
out
of
the
way
to
my
old
cave
in
the
valley
,
and
be
keep
there
,
with
two
Spaniards
to
guard
them
and
give
them
food
;
which
be
do
;
and
they
be
bind
there
hand
and
foot
for
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Spaniards
come
,
the
two
englishman
be
so
encouraged
,
that
they
could
not
satisfy
themselves
to
stay
any
longer
there
;
but
take
five
of
the
Spaniards
,
and
themselves
,
with
four
musket
and
a
pistol
among
them
,
and
two
stout
quarter
-
stave
,
away
they
go
in
quest
of
the
savage
.
<EOS>
and
first
,
they
come
to
the
tree
where
the
man
lie
that
have
be
kill
;
but
it
be
easy
to
see
that
some
more
of
the
savage
have
be
there
;
for
they
attempt
to
carry
their
dead
man
away
,
and
have
drag
two
of
them
a
good
way
,
but
have
give
it
over
;
from
thence
they
advance
to
the
first
rise
ground
,
where
they
have
stand
and
see
their
camp
destroy
,
and
where
they
have
the
mortification
still
to
see
some
of
the
smoke
;
but
neither
could
they
here
see
any
of
the
savage
:
they
then
resolve
,
though
with
all
possible
caution
,
to
go
forward
towards
their
ruin
plantation
;
but
a
little
before
they
come
thither
,
come
in
sight
of
the
sea
-
shore
<EOS>
,
they
see
plainly
the
savage
all
embark
again
in
their
canoe
,
in
order
to
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
They
seem
sorry
at
first
that
there
be
no
way
to
come
at
them
to
give
them
a
parting
blow
;
but
upon
the
whole
be
very
well
satisfied
to
be
rid
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
englishman
be
now
twice
ruin
,
and
all
their
improvement
destroy
,
the
rest
all
agree
to
come
and
help
them
to
rebuild
,
and
to
assist
them
with
needful
supply
.
<EOS>
Their
three
countryman
,
who
be
not
yet
note
for
have
the
least
inclination
to
do
any
thing
good
,
yet
,
as
soon
as
they
hear
of
it
(
for
they
,
live
remote
,
know
nothing
till
all
be
over
)
,
come
and
offer
their
help
and
assistance
,
and
do
very
friendly
work
for
several
day
to
restore
their
habitation
and
make
necessary
for
them
;
and
thus
in
a
little
time
they
be
set
upon
their
leg
again
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
day
after
this
they
have
the
farth
satisfaction
of
see
three
of
the
savage
'
canoe
come
drive
onshore
,
and
at
some
distance
from
them
,
with
two
drown
man
;
by
which
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
they
have
meet
with
a
storm
at
sea
,
which
have
overset
some
of
them
,
for
it
blow
very
hard
the
night
after
they
go
off
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
some
may
miscarry
,
so
on
the
other
hand
enough
of
them
escape
to
inform
the
rest
,
as
well
of
what
they
have
do
,
as
of
what
happen
to
them
;
and
to
whet
them
on
to
another
enterprise
of
the
same
nature
,
which
they
,
it
seem
,
resolve
to
attempt
,
with
sufficient
force
to
carry
all
before
them
;
for
except
what
the
first
man
tell
them
of
inhabitant
,
they
could
say
little
to
it
of
their
own
knowledge
;
for
they
never
see
one
man
,
and
the
fellow
be
kill
<EOS>
that
have
affirm
it
,
they
have
no
other
witness
to
confirm
it
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
five
or
six
month
after
this
before
they
hear
any
more
of
the
savage
,
in
which
time
our
man
be
in
hope
they
have
not
forget
their
former
bad
luck
,
or
have
give
over
the
hope
of
better
;
when
on
a
sudden
they
be
invade
with
a
most
formidable
fleet
of
no
less
than
twenty
-
eight
canoe
,
full
of
savage
,
arm
with
bow
and
arrow
,
great
club
,
wooden
sword
,
and
such
-
like
engine
of
war
;
and
they
bring
such
number
with
them
,
that
in
short
it
put
all
our
people
into
the
utmost
consternation
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
come
on
shore
in
the
evening
,
and
at
the
easternmost
side
of
the
island
,
our
man
have
that
night
to
consult
and
consider
what
to
do
;
and
in
the
first
place
,
know
that
their
be
entirely
conceal
be
their
only
safety
before
,
and
would
much
more
be
so
now
,
<EOS>
while
the
number
of
their
enemy
be
so
great
,
they
therefore
resolve
,
first
of
all
,
to
take
down
the
hut
which
be
build
for
the
two
englishman
,
and
drive
away
their
goat
to
the
old
cave
;
because
they
suppose
the
savage
would
go
directly
thither
as
soon
as
it
be
day
,
to
play
the
old
game
over
again
,
though
they
do
not
now
land
within
two
league
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
they
drive
away
all
the
flock
of
goat
they
have
at
the
old
bower
,
as
I
call
it
,
which
belong
to
the
Spaniards
;
and
,
in
short
,
leave
as
little
appearance
of
inhabitant
any
where
as
possible
;
and
the
next
morning
early
they
post
themselves
with
all
their
force
at
the
plantation
of
the
two
man
,
wait
for
their
come
.
<EOS>
as
they
guess
,
so
it
happen
:
<EOS>
these
new
invader
,
leave
their
canoe
at
the
east
end
of
the
island
,
come
range
along
the
shore
,
directly
towards
the
place
,
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
,
as
near
as
our
man
could
judge
.
<EOS>
Our
army
be
but
small
indeed
;
but
that
which
be
bad
,
they
have
not
arm
for
all
their
number
neither
:
<EOS>
the
whole
account
,
it
seem
,
stand
thus
:
 
first
,
as
to
man
:
       
17
Spaniards

5
Englishmen

live
with
the
Spaniards

<EOS>
to
arm
these
they
have

<EOS>
29
  
<EOS>
to
their
slave
they
do
not
give
either
musket
or
fusil
,
but
they
have
every
one
an
halbert
,
or
a
long
staff
,
like
a
quarter

staff
,
with
a
great
spike
of

fasten
into
each
end
of
it

by
his
side
a

also
every
one
of
our
man
have
hatchet
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
woman
could
not
be
prevail
upon
but
they
would
come
into
the
fight
,
and
they
have
bow
and
arrow
,
which
the
Spaniards
have
take
from
the
savage
when
the
first
action
happen
,
which
I
have
speak
of
,
where
the
Indians
fight
with
one
another
;
and
the
woman
have
hatchet
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
governor
,
whom
I
have
describe
so
often
,
command
the
whole
;
and
William
Atkins
,
who
,
though
a
dreadful
fellow
for
wickedness
,
be
a
most
daring
,
bold
fellow
,
command
under
him
.
<EOS>
the
savage
come
forward
like
lion
,
and
our
man
,
which
be
the
bad
of
their
fate
,
have
no
advantage
in
their
situation
;
only
that
Will
Atkins
,
who
now
prove
a
most
useful
fellow
,
with
six
man
,
be
plant
just
behind
a
small
thicket
of
bush
,
as
an
advanced
guard
,
with
order
to
let
the
first
of
them
pass
by
,
and
then
fire
into
the
middle
of
them
;
and
as
soon
as
he
have
fire
to
make
his
retreat
,
as
nimbly
as
he
could
,
round
a
part
of
the
wood
,
and
so
come
in
behind
the
Spaniards
where
they
stand
,
have
a
thicket
of
tree
all
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
savage
come
on
,
they
run
straggle
about
every
way
in
heap
,
out
of
all
manner
of
order
,
and
Will
Atkins
let
about
fifty
of
them
pass
by
him
;
then
see
the
rest
come
in
a
very
thick
throng
,
he
order
three
of
his
man
to
fire
,
have
load
their
musket
with
six
or
seven
bullet
apiece
,
about
as
big
as
large
pistol
-
bullet
.
<EOS>
how
many
they
kill
or
wound
they
know
not
;
but
the
consternation
and
surprise
be
inexpressible
among
the
savage
,
who
be
fright
to
the
last
degree
,
to
hear
such
a
dreadful
noise
,
and
see
their
man
kill
,
and
other
hurt
,
but
see
nobody
that
do
it
.
<EOS>
when
in
the
middle
of
their
fright
,
William
Atkins
and
his
other
three
let
fly
again
among
the
thick
of
them
and
in
less
than
a
minute
the
first
three
,
be
load
again
,
give
them
a
third
volley
.
  
<EOS>
have
William
Atkins
and
his
man
retire
immediately
,
as
soon
as
they
have
fire
,
as
they
be
order
to
do
;
or
have
the
rest
of
the
body
be
at
hand
to
have
pour
in
their
shot
continually
,
the
savage
have
be
effectually
route
;
for
the
terror
that
be
among
them
come
principally
from
this
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
kill
by
the
god
with
thunder
and
lightning
,
and
could
see
nobody
that
hurt
them
:
but
William
Atkins
stay
to
load
again
,
discover
the
cheat
;
some
of
the
savage
who
be
at
a
distance
,
spy
them
,
come
upon
them
behind
;
and
though
Atkins
and
his
man
fire
at
them
also
,
two
or
three
time
,
and
kill
above
twenty
,
retire
as
fast
as
they
could
,
yet
they
wound
Atkins
himself
,
and
kill
one
of
his
fellow
Englishmen
with
their
arrow
,
as
they
do
afterwards
one
Spaniard
,
and
one
of
the
indian
slave
who
come
with
the
woman
.
<EOS>
this
slave
be
a
most
gallant
fellow
,
and
fight
most
desperately
,
kill
five
of
them
with
his
own
hand
,
have
no
weapon
but
one
of
the
armed
stave
and
a
hatchet
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
thus
hard
lay
at
,
Atkins
wound
,
and
two
other
man
kill
,
retreat
to
a
rise
ground
in
the
wood
;
and
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
,
after
fire
three
vollie
upon
them
,
retreat
also
;
for
their
number
be
so
great
,
and
they
be
so
desperate
,
that
though
above
fifty
of
them
be
kill
,
and
more
than
so
many
wound
,
yet
they
come
on
in
the
tooth
of
our
man
,
fearless
of
danger
,
and
shoot
their
arrow
like
a
cloud
;
and
it
be
observe
,
that
their
wound
man
,
who
be
not
quite
disabled
,
be
make
outrageous
by
their
wound
,
and
fight
like
madman
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
man
retreat
,
they
leave
the
Spaniard
and
the
Englishman
that
be
kill
behind
them
;
and
the
savage
,
when
they
come
up
to
them
,
kill
them
over
again
in
a
wretched
manner
,
break
their
arm
,
leg
,
and
head
,
with
their
club
and
wooden
sword
,
like
true
savage
.
<EOS>
but
find
our
man
be
go
,
they
do
not
seem
inclined
to
pursue
them
,
but
draw
themselves
up
in
a
kind
of
ring
,
which
be
,
it
seem
,
their
custom
,
and
shout
twice
in
token
of
their
victory
;
after
which
,
they
have
the
mortification
to
see
several
of
their
wound
man
fall
,
die
with
the
mere
loss
of
blood
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
governor
have
draw
his
little
body
up
together
upon
a
rise
ground
,
Atkins
,
though
he
be
wound
,
would
have
have
him
march
,
and
charge
them
again
all
together
at
once
:
but
the
Spaniard
reply
,
"
Seignior
Atkins
,
you
see
how
their
wound
man
fight
;
let
them
alone
till
morning
;
all
these
wound
man
will
be
stiff
and
sore
with
their
wound
,
and
faint
with
the
loss
of
blood
,
and
so
we
shall
have
the
few
to
engage
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
advice
be
good
;
but
Will
Atkins
reply
merrily
,
"
that
be
true
,
Seignior
,
and
<EOS>
so
shall
I
too
;
and
that
be
the
reason
I
would
go
on
while
I
be
warm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Seignior
Atkins
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
"
you
have
behave
gallantly
,
and
do
your
part
;
we
will
fight
for
you
,
if
you
can
not
come
on
;
but
I
think
it
best
to
stay
till
morning
:
"
so
they
wait
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
a
clear
moonlight
night
,
and
they
find
the
savage
in
great
disorder
about
their
dead
and
wounded
man
,
and
a
great
hurry
and
noise
among
them
where
they
lay
,
they
afterwards
resolve
to
fall
upon
them
in
the
night
,
especially
if
they
could
come
to
give
them
but
one
volley
before
they
be
discover
.
<EOS>
this
they
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
do
;
for
one
of
the
two
englishman
,
in
whose
quarter
it
be
where
the
fight
begin
,
lead
them
round
between
the
wood
and
the
sea
-
side
,
westward
,
and
turn
short
south
,
they
come
so
near
where
the
thick
of
them
lie
,
that
before
they
be
see
or
hear
,
eight
of
them
fire
in
among
them
,
and
do
dreadful
execution
upon
them
;
in
half
a
minute
more
eight
other
fire
after
them
,
pour
in
their
small
shot
in
such
a
quantity
,
that
abundance
be
kill
and
wound
;
and
all
this
while
they
be
not
able
to
see
who
hurt
them
,
or
which
way
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
charge
again
with
the
utmost
expedition
,
and
then
divide
themselves
into
three
body
,
and
resolve
to
fall
in
among
them
all
together
.
<EOS>
They
have
in
each
body
eight
person
;
that
be
to
say
,
twenty
-
four
,
whereof
be
twenty
-
two
man
,
and
the
two
woman
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
fight
desperately
.
  
<EOS>
They
divide
the
fire
-
arm
equally
in
each
party
,
and
so
of
the
halbert
and
stave
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
have
the
woman
keep
back
;
but
they
say
they
be
resolve
to
die
with
their
husband
.
<EOS>
have
thus
form
their
little
army
,
they
march
out
from
among
the
tree
,
and
come
up
to
the
tooth
of
the
enemy
,
shout
and
halloo
as
loud
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
the
savage
stand
all
together
,
but
be
in
the
utmost
confusion
,
hear
the
noise
of
our
man
shout
from
three
quarter
together
;
they
would
have
fight
if
they
have
see
us
;
and
as
soon
as
we
come
near
enough
to
be
see
,
some
arrow
be
shoot
,
and
poor
old
Friday
be
wound
,
though
not
dangerously
.
<EOS>
but
our
man
give
them
no
time
,
but
run
up
to
them
,
fire
among
them
three
way
,
and
then
fall
in
with
the
butt
end
of
their
musket
,
their
sword
,
armed
stave
,
and
hatchet
;
and
lay
about
them
so
well
,
that
in
a
word
they
set
up
a
dismal
screaming
and
howl
,
fly
to
save
their
life
which
way
soever
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
tired
with
the
execution
;
and
kill
,
or
mortally
wound
,
in
the
two
fight
,
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
of
them
:
the
rest
,
be
fright
out
of
their
wit
,
scour
through
the
wood
and
over
the
hill
,
with
all
the
speed
that
fear
and
nimble
foot
could
help
them
to
do
;
and
as
we
do
not
trouble
ourselves
much
to
pursue
them
,
they
get
all
together
to
the
sea
-
side
,
where
they
land
,
and
where
their
canoe
lie
.
<EOS>
but
their
disaster
be
not
at
an
end
yet
,
for
it
blow
a
terrible
storm
of
wind
that
evening
from
the
seaward
,
so
that
it
be
impossible
for
them
to
put
off
;
nay
,
the
storm
continue
all
night
,
when
the
tide
come
up
their
canoe
be
most
of
them
drive
by
the
surge
of
the
sea
so
high
upon
the
shore
,
that
it
require
infinite
toil
to
get
them
off
;
and
some
of
them
be
even
dash
to
piece
against
the
beach
,
or
against
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
,
though
glad
of
their
victory
,
yet
get
little
rest
that
night
;
but
have
refresh
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
,
they
resolve
to
march
to
that
part
of
the
island
where
the
savage
be
flee
,
and
see
what
posture
they
be
in
.
<EOS>
this
necessarily
lead
them
over
the
place
where
the
fight
have
be
,
and
where
they
find
several
of
the
poor
creature
not
quite
dead
,
and
yet
past
recover
life
;
a
sight
disagreeable
enough
to
generous
mind
;
for
a
truly
great
man
,
though
oblige
by
the
law
of
battle
to
destroy
his
enemy
,
take
no
delight
in
his
misery
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
need
to
give
any
order
in
this
case
;
for
their
own
savage
,
who
be
their
servant
,
dispatch
those
poor
creature
with
their
hatchet
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
they
come
in
view
of
the
place
where
the
more
miserable
remain
of
the
savage
'
army
lie
,
where
there
appear
about
one
hundred
still
:
their
posture
be
generally
sit
upon
the
ground
,
with
their
knee
up
towards
their
mouth
,
and
the
head
put
between
the
hand
,
lean
down
upon
the
knee
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
man
come
within
two
musket
-
shot
of
them
,
the
Spaniard
governor
order
two
musket
to
be
fire
without
ball
,
to
alarm
them
;
this
he
do
,
that
by
their
countenance
he
may
know
what
to
expect
,
viz
.
<EOS>
whether
they
be
still
in
heart
to
fight
,
or
be
so
heartily
beat
,
as
to
be
dispirit
and
discourage
,
and
so
he
may
manage
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
this
stratagem
take
;
for
as
soon
as
the
savage
hear
the
first
gun
,
and
see
the
flash
of
the
second
,
they
start
up
upon
their
foot
in
the
great
consternation
imaginable
;
and
as
our
man
advance
swiftly
towards
them
,
they
all
run
scream
and
yawl
away
,
with
a
kind
of
an
howl
noise
,
which
our
man
do
not
understand
,
and
have
never
hear
before
;
and
thus
they
run
up
the
hill
into
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
our
man
have
much
rather
the
weather
have
be
calm
,
and
they
have
all
go
away
to
sea
;
but
they
do
not
then
consider
,
that
this
may
probably
have
be
the
occasion
of
their
come
again
in
such
multitude
as
not
to
be
resist
;
or
,
at
least
,
to
come
so
many
and
so
often
,
as
would
quite
desolate
the
island
and
starve
them
.
<EOS>
Will
Atkins
therefore
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
wound
,
keep
always
with
them
,
prove
the
good
counsellor
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
His
advice
be
,
to
take
the
advantage
that
offer
,
and
clap
in
between
them
and
their
boat
,
and
so
deprive
them
of
the
capacity
of
ever
return
any
more
to
plague
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
They
consult
long
about
this
,
and
some
be
against
it
,
for
fear
of
make
the
wretch
fly
into
the
wood
,
and
live
there
desperate
;
and
so
they
should
have
them
to
hunt
like
wild
beast
,
be
afraid
to
stir
about
their
business
,
and
have
their
plantation
continually
rifle
,
all
their
tame
goat
destroy
,
and
,
in
short
,
be
reduce
to
a
life
of
continual
distress
.
  
<EOS>
Will
Atkins
tell
them
they
have
better
have
to
do
with
one
hundred
man
than
with
one
hundred
nation
;
that
as
they
must
destroy
their
boat
,
so
they
must
destroy
the
man
,
or
be
all
of
them
destroy
themselves
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
shew
them
the
necessity
of
it
<EOS>
so
plainly
,
that
they
all
come
into
it
;
so
they
go
to
work
immediately
with
the
boat
,
and
get
some
dry
wood
together
from
a
dead
tree
,
they
try
to
set
some
of
them
on
fire
;
but
they
be
so
wet
that
they
would
scarce
burn
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
fire
so
burn
the
upper
part
,
that
it
soon
make
them
unfit
for
swimming
in
the
sea
as
boat
.
<EOS>
when
the
Indians
see
what
they
be
about
,
some
of
them
come
run
out
of
the
wood
,
and
come
as
near
as
they
could
to
our
man
,
kneel
down
and
cry
,
Oa
,
Oa
,
Waramokoa
,
and
some
other
word
of
their
language
,
which
none
of
the
other
understand
any
thing
of
;
but
as
they
make
pitiful
gesture
and
strange
noise
,
it
be
easy
to
understand
they
beg
to
have
their
boat
spare
,
and
that
they
would
be
go
,
and
never
return
thither
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
man
be
now
satisfied
,
that
they
have
no
way
to
preserve
themselves
or
to
save
their
colony
,
but
effectually
to
prevent
any
of
these
people
from
ever
go
home
again
;
depend
upon
this
,
that
if
ever
so
much
as
one
of
them
get
back
into
their
country
to
tell
the
story
,
the
colony
be
undo
;
so
that
let
them
know
that
they
should
not
have
any
mercy
,
they
fall
to
work
with
their
canoe
,
and
destroy
them
,
every
one
that
the
storm
have
not
destroy
before
;
at
the
sight
of
which
the
savage
raise
a
hideous
cry
in
the
wood
,
which
our
people
hear
plain
enough
;
after
which
they
run
about
the
island
like
distract
man
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
our
man
do
not
really
know
at
first
what
to
do
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
the
Spaniards
,
with
all
their
prudence
,
consider
that
while
they
make
those
people
thus
desperate
,
they
ought
to
have
keep
good
guard
at
the
same
time
upon
their
plantation
;
for
though
it
be
true
they
have
drive
away
their
cattle
,
and
the
Indians
do
not
find
their
main
retreat
,
I
mean
my
old
castle
at
the
hill
,
nor
the
cave
in
the
valley
;
yet
they
find
out
my
plantation
at
the
bower
,
and
pull
it
all
to
piece
,
and
all
the
fence
and
plant
about
it
;
trod
all
the
corn
under
foot
;
tear
up
the
vine
and
grape
,
be
just
then
almost
ripe
,
and
do
our
man
an
inestimable
damage
,
though
to
themselves
not
one
farthing's
-
worth
of
service
.
  
<EOS>
though
our
man
be
able
to
fight
them
upon
all
occasion
,
yet
they
be
in
no
condition
to
pursue
them
,
or
hunt
them
up
and
down
;
for
as
they
be
too
nimble
of
foot
for
our
man
when
they
find
them
single
,
so
our
man
durst
not
go
about
single
for
fear
of
be
surround
with
their
number
:
the
good
be
,
they
have
no
weapon
;
for
though
they
have
bow
they
have
no
arrow
leave
,
nor
any
material
to
make
any
,
nor
have
they
any
edge
tool
or
weapon
among
them
.
<EOS>
the
extremity
and
distress
they
be
reduce
to
be
great
,
and
indeed
deplorable
,
but
at
the
same
time
our
man
be
also
bring
to
very
hard
circumstance
by
them
;
for
though
their
retreat
be
preserve
,
yet
their
provision
be
destroy
,
and
their
harvest
spoil
;
and
what
to
do
or
which
way
to
turn
themselves
,
they
know
not
;
<EOS>
the
only
refuge
they
have
now
be
the
stock
of
cattle
they
have
in
the
valley
by
the
cave
,
and
some
little
corn
which
grow
there
.
<EOS>
the
three
Englishmen
,
William
Atkins
and
his
comrade
,
be
now
reduce
to
two
,
one
of
them
be
kill
by
an
arrow
,
which
strike
him
on
the
side
of
his
head
,
just
under
the
temple
,
so
that
he
never
speak
more
;
and
it
be
very
remarkable
,
that
this
be
the
same
barbarous
fellow
who
cut
the
poor
savage
slave
with
his
hatchet
,
and
who
afterwards
intend
to
have
murder
the
Spaniards
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
upon
their
case
to
have
be
bad
at
this
time
than
mine
be
at
any
time
after
I
first
discover
the
grain
of
barley
and
rice
,
and
get
into
the
method
of
plant
and
raise
my
corn
,
and
my
tame
cattle
;
for
now
they
have
,
as
I
may
say
,
an
hundred
wolf
upon
the
island
,
which
would
devour
every
thing
they
could
come
at
,
yet
could
be
very
hardly
come
at
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
they
conclude
when
they
see
what
their
circumstance
be
,
be
,
that
they
would
,
if
possible
,
drive
them
up
to
the
farth
part
of
the
island
,
south
-
east
,
that
if
any
more
savage
come
on
shore
,
they
may
not
find
one
another
;
then
that
they
would
daily
hunt
and
harass
them
,
and
kill
as
many
of
them
as
they
could
come
at
,
till
they
have
reduce
the
number
;
and
if
they
could
at
last
tame
them
,
and
bring
them
to
any
thing
,
they
would
give
them
corn
,
and
teach
them
how
to
plant
,
and
live
upon
their
daily
Labour
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
this
they
follow
them
,
and
so
terrify
them
with
their
gun
,
that
in
a
few
day
,
if
any
of
them
fire
a
gun
at
an
Indian
,
if
he
do
not
hit
him
,
yet
he
would
fall
down
for
fear
;
and
so
dreadfully
fright
they
be
,
that
they
keep
out
of
sight
farther
and
farther
,
till
at
last
our
man
follow
them
,
and
every
day
almost
kill
and
wound
some
of
them
,
they
keep
up
in
the
wood
and
hollow
place
so
much
,
that
it
reduce
them
to
the
utmost
misery
for
want
of
food
;
and
many
be
afterwards
find
dead
in
the
wood
,
without
any
hurt
,
but
merely
starve
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
man
find
this
,
it
make
their
heart
relent
,
and
pity
move
them
;
especially
the
Spaniard
governor
,
who
be
the
most
gentleman
-
like
,
generous
-
minded
man
that
ever
I
meet
with
in
my
life
;
and
he
propose
,
if
possible
,
to
take
one
of
them
alive
,
and
bring
him
to
understand
what
they
mean
,
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
act
as
interpreter
,
and
to
go
among
them
,
and
see
if
they
may
be
bring
to
some
condition
that
may
be
depend
upon
,
to
save
their
life
,
and
do
us
no
spoil
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
any
of
them
could
be
take
;
but
be
weak
,
and
half
-
starve
,
one
of
them
be
at
last
surprised
,
and
make
a
prisoner
:
he
be
sullen
at
first
,
and
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
;
but
find
himself
kindly
use
,
and
victual
give
him
,
and
no
violence
offer
him
,
he
at
last
grow
tractable
,
and
come
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
They
bring
old
Friday
to
him
,
who
talk
often
with
him
,
and
tell
him
how
kind
the
other
would
be
to
them
all
:
that
they
would
not
only
save
their
life
,
but
would
give
them
a
part
of
the
island
to
live
in
,
provide
they
would
give
satisfaction
;
that
they
should
keep
in
their
own
bound
,
and
not
come
beyond
them
,
to
injure
or
prejudice
other
;
and
that
they
should
have
corn
give
them
,
to
plant
and
make
it
grow
for
their
bread
,
and
some
bread
give
them
for
their
present
subsistence
;
and
old
Friday
bid
the
fellow
go
and
talk
with
the
rest
of
his
countryman
,
and
hear
what
they
say
to
it
,
assure
them
that
if
they
do
not
agree
immediately
they
should
all
be
destroy
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
wretch
,
thoroughly
humble
,
and
reduce
in
number
to
about
thirty
-
seven
,
close
with
the
proposal
at
the
first
offer
,
and
beg
to
have
some
food
give
them
;
upon
which
twelve
Spaniards
and
two
englishman
,
well
armed
,
and
three
indian
slave
,
and
old
Friday
,
march
to
the
place
where
they
be
;
the
three
indian
slave
carry
them
a
large
quantity
of
bread
,
and
some
rice
boil
up
to
cake
,
and
dry
in
the
sun
,
and
three
live
goat
;
and
they
be
order
to
go
to
the
side
of
an
hill
,
where
they
sit
down
,
eat
the
provision
very
thankfully
,
and
be
the
most
faithful
fellow
to
their
word
that
could
be
think
of
;
for
except
when
they
come
to
beg
victual
and
direction
they
never
come
out
of
their
bound
;
and
there
they
live
when
I
come
to
the
island
,
and
I
go
to
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
teach
them
both
to
plant
corn
,
make
read
,
breed
tame
goat
,
and
milk
them
;
they
want
nothing
but
wife
,
and
they
soon
would
have
be
a
nation
:
they
be
confine
to
a
neck
of
land
surround
with
high
rock
behind
them
,
and
lie
plain
towards
the
sea
before
them
,
on
the
south
-
east
corner
of
the
island
;
they
have
land
enough
,
and
it
be
very
good
and
fruitful
;
for
they
have
a
piece
of
land
about
a
mile
and
a
half
broad
,
and
three
or
four
mile
in
length
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
teach
them
to
make
wooden
spade
,
such
as
I
make
for
myself
;
and
give
among
them
twelve
hatchet
,
and
three
or
four
knife
;
and
there
they
live
,
the
most
subjected
innocent
creature
that
be
ever
hear
of
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
the
colony
enjoy
a
perfect
tranquillity
with
respect
to
the
savage
,
till
I
come
to
revisit
them
,
which
be
in
about
two
year
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
now
<EOS>
and
then
some
canoe
of
savage
come
on
shore
for
their
triumphal
,
unnatural
feast
;
but
as
they
be
of
several
nation
,
and
,
perhaps
,
have
never
hear
of
those
that
come
before
,
or
the
reason
of
it
,
they
do
not
make
any
search
or
inquiry
after
their
countryman
;
and
if
they
have
,
it
would
have
be
very
hard
for
them
to
have
find
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
I
think
,
I
have
give
a
full
account
of
all
that
happen
to
them
to
my
return
,
at
least
that
be
worth
notice
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
,
or
savage
,
be
wonderfully
civilized
by
them
,
and
they
frequently
go
among
them
;
but
forbid
,
on
pain
of
death
,
any
of
the
Indians
come
to
them
,
because
they
would
not
have
their
settlement
betray
again
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
be
very
remarkable
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
teach
the
savage
to
make
wicker
-
work
,
or
basket
;
but
they
soon
outdo
their
master
;
for
they
make
abundance
of
most
ingenious
thing
in
wicker
-
work
;
particularly
all
sort
of
basket
,
sieve
,
bird
-
cage
,
cupboard
,
&
c.
as
also
chair
to
sit
on
,
stool
,
bed
,
couch
,
and
abundance
of
other
thing
,
be
very
ingenious
at
such
work
when
they
be
once
put
in
the
way
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
coming
be
a
particular
relief
to
these
people
,
because
we
furnish
them
with
knife
,
scissar
,
spade
,
shovel
,
pickaxe
,
and
all
thing
of
that
kind
which
they
could
want
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
help
of
these
tool
they
be
so
very
handy
,
that
they
come
at
last
to
build
up
their
hut
,
or
house
,
very
handsomely
;
raddle
,
or
work
it
up
like
basket
-
work
<EOS>
all
the
way
round
,
which
be
a
very
extraordinary
piece
of
ingenuity
,
and
look
very
odd
;
but
be
an
exceed
good
fence
,
as
well
against
heat
,
as
against
all
sort
of
vermin
;
and
our
man
be
so
take
with
it
,
that
they
get
the
wild
savage
to
come
and
do
the
like
for
them
;
so
that
when
I
come
to
see
the
two
englishman
's
colony
,
they
look
,
at
a
distance
,
as
if
they
live
all
like
bee
in
a
hive
;
and
as
for
Will
Atkins
,
who
be
now
become
a
very
industrious
,
necessary
,
and
sober
fellow
,
he
have
make
himself
such
a
tent
of
basket
work
as
I
believe
be
never
see
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
hundred
and
twenty
pace
round
on
the
outside
,
as
I
measure
by
my
step
;
the
wall
be
as
close
work
as
a
basket
,
in
pannel
or
square
,
thirty
-
two
in
number
,
and
very
strong
,
stand
about
seven
foot
high
:
<EOS>
in
the
middle
be
another
not
above
twenty
-
two
pace
round
,
but
build
strong
,
be
eight
-
square
in
its
form
,
and
in
the
eight
corner
stand
eight
very
strong
post
,
round
the
top
of
which
he
lay
strong
piece
,
join
together
with
wooden
pin
,
from
which
he
raise
a
pyramid
before
the
roof
of
eight
rafter
,
very
handsome
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
and
join
together
very
well
,
though
he
have
no
nail
,
and
only
a
few
iron
spike
,
which
he
have
make
himself
too
,
out
of
the
old
iron
that
I
have
leave
there
;
and
indeed
this
fellow
shew
abundance
of
ingenuity
in
several
thing
which
he
have
no
knowledge
of
;
he
make
himself
a
forge
,
with
a
pair
of
wooden
bellow
to
blow
the
fire
;
he
make
himself
charcoal
for
his
work
,
and
he
form
out
of
one
of
the
iron
crow
a
middling
good
anvil
to
hammer
upon
;
in
this
manner
he
make
many
thing
,
but
especially
hook
,
staple
and
spike
,
bolt
and
hinge
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
house
:
after
he
pitch
the
roof
of
his
innermost
tent
,
he
work
it
up
between
the
rafter
with
basket
-
work
,
so
firm
,
and
thatch
that
over
again
so
ingeniously
with
rice
-
straw
,
and
over
that
a
large
leaf
of
a
tree
,
which
cover
the
top
,
that
his
house
be
as
dry
as
if
it
have
be
tile
or
slate
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
own
that
the
savage
make
the
basket
-
work
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
outer
circuit
be
cover
,
as
a
lean
-
to
,
all
round
<EOS>
his
inner
,
apartment
,
and
long
rafter
lie
from
the
thirty
two
angle
to
the
top
post
of
the
inner
house
,
be
about
twenty
foot
distant
;
so
that
there
be
a
space
like
a
walk
within
the
outer
wicker
wall
,
and
without
the
inner
,
near
twenty
foot
wide
.
  
<EOS>
the
inner
place
he
partition
off
with
the
same
wicker
work
,
but
much
fair
,
and
divide
into
six
apartment
,
for
that
he
have
six
room
on
a
floor
,
and
out
of
every
one
of
these
there
be
a
door
:
first
,
into
the
entry
,
or
come
into
the
main
tent
;
and
another
door
into
the
space
or
walk
that
be
round
it
;
so
that
this
walk
be
also
divide
into
six
equal
part
,
which
serve
not
only
for
a
retreat
,
but
to
store
up
any
necessary
which
the
family
have
occasion
for
.
<EOS>
these
six
space
not
take
up
the
whole
circumference
,
what
other
apartment
the
outer
circle
have
,
be
thus
order
:
as
soon
as
you
be
in
at
the
door
of
the
outer
circle
,
you
have
a
short
passage
straight
before
you
to
the
door
of
the
inner
house
;
but
on
either
side
be
a
wicker
partition
,
and
a
door
in
it
,
by
which
you
go
first
into
a
large
room
or
storehouse
,
twenty
foot
wide
,
and
about
thirty
foot
long
,
and
through
that
into
another
not
quite
so
long
:
so
that
in
the
outer
circle
be
ten
handsome
room
,
six
of
which
be
only
to
be
come
at
through
the
apartment
of
the
inner
tent
,
and
serve
as
closet
or
retire
room
to
the
respective
chamber
of
the
inner
circle
;
and
four
large
warehouse
or
barn
,
or
what
you
please
to
call
them
,
which
go
in
through
one
another
,
two
on
either
hand
of
the
passage
that
lead
through
the
outer
door
to
the
inner
tent
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
piece
of
basket
-
work
,
I
believe
,
be
never
see
in
the
world
;
nor
an
house
or
tent
so
neatly
contrive
,
much
less
so
build
.
<EOS>
in
this
great
beehive
live
the
three
family
;
that
be
to
say
,
Will
Atkins
and
his
companion
;
the
third
be
kill
,
but
his
wife
remain
with
three
child
;
for
she
be
,
it
seem
,
big
with
child
when
he
die
,
and
the
other
two
be
not
at
all
backward
to
give
the
widow
her
full
share
of
every
thing
,
I
mean
as
to
their
corn
,
milk
,
grape
,
&
c.
<EOS>
and
when
they
kill
a
kid
,
or
find
a
turtle
on
the
shore
;
so
that
they
all
live
well
enough
,
though
it
be
true
<EOS>
,
they
be
not
so
industrious
as
the
other
two
,
as
have
be
observe
already
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
can
not
be
omit
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
,
as
for
religion
,
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
any
thing
of
that
kind
among
them
;
they
pretty
often
indeed
put
one
another
in
mind
that
there
be
a
God
,
by
the
very
common
method
of
seaman
,
viz
.
<EOS>
swear
by
his
name
;
nor
be
their
poor
,
ignorant
,
savage
wife
much
the
well
for
have
be
marry
to
Christians
as
we
must
call
them
;
for
as
they
know
very
little
of
God
themselves
,
so
they
be
utterly
incapable
of
enter
into
any
discourse
with
their
wife
about
a
God
or
to
talk
any
thing
to
them
concern
religion
.
  
<EOS>
the
utmost
of
all
the
improvement
which
I
can
say
the
wife
have
make
from
them
,
be
,
that
they
have
teach
them
to
speak
English
pretty
well
;
and
all
the
child
they
have
,
which
be
near
twenty
in
all
be
teach
to
speak
English
too
,
from
their
first
learning
to
speak
,
though
they
at
first
speak
it
in
a
very
broken
manner
,
like
their
mother
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
of
those
child
above
six
year
old
when
I
come
thither
;
for
it
be
not
much
above
seven
year
that
they
have
fetch
these
five
savage
lady
over
,
but
they
have
all
be
pretty
fruitful
,
for
they
have
all
child
,
more
or
less
:
I
think
the
cook
's
mate
's
wife
be
big
of
her
sixth
child
;
and
the
mother
be
all
a
good
sort
of
well
-
govern
,
quiet
,
laborious
woman
,
modest
and
decent
,
helpful
to
one
another
,
mighty
observant
and
subject
to
their
master
,
I
can
not
call
them
husband
;
and
want
nothing
but
to
be
well
instruct
in
the
christian
religion
,
and
to
be
legally
married
;
both
which
be
happily
bring
about
afterwards
by
my
mean
,
or
at
least
by
the
consequence
of
my
come
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
give
an
account
of
the
colony
in
general
,
and
pretty
much
of
my
five
runagate
Englishmen
,
I
must
say
something
of
the
Spaniards
,
who
be
the
main
body
of
the
family
,
and
in
whose
story
there
be
some
incident
also
remarkable
enough
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
many
discourse
with
them
about
their
circumstance
when
they
be
among
the
savage
;
they
tell
me
readily
,
that
they
have
no
instance
to
give
of
their
application
or
ingenuity
in
that
country
;
that
they
be
a
poor
,
miserable
,
dejected
handful
of
people
;
that
if
mean
have
be
put
into
their
hand
,
they
have
yet
so
abandon
themselves
to
despair
,
and
so
sink
under
the
weight
of
their
misfortune
,
that
they
think
of
nothing
but
starve
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
a
grave
and
very
sensible
man
,
tell
me
he
be
convince
they
be
in
the
wrong
;
that
it
be
not
the
part
of
wise
man
to
give
up
themselves
to
their
misery
,
but
always
to
take
hold
of
the
help
which
reason
offer
,
as
well
for
present
support
,
as
for
future
deliverance
;
he
tell
me
that
grief
be
the
most
senseless
insignificant
passion
in
the
world
,
for
that
it
regard
only
thing
past
,
which
be
generally
impossible
to
he
recall
or
to
be
remedie
,
but
have
no
view
to
thing
to
come
,
and
have
no
share
in
any
thing
that
look
like
deliverance
,
but
rather
add
to
the
affliction
than
propose
a
remedy
;
and
upon
this
he
repeat
a
spanish
proverb
,
which
though
I
can
not
repeat
in
just
the
same
word
that
he
speak
it
,
yet
I
remember
I
make
it
into
an
english
proverb
of
my
own
,
thus
;
       
in
trouble
to
be
trouble
,
     
be
to
have
your
trouble
double
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
run
on
in
remark
upon
all
the
little
improvement
I
have
make
in
my
solitude
;
my
unwearied
application
,
as
he
call
it
,
and
how
I
have
make
a
condition
,
which
in
its
circumstance
be
at
first
much
bad
than
theirs
,
a
thousand
time
more
happy
than
theirs
be
,
even
now
when
they
be
all
together
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
it
be
remarkable
that
Englishmen
have
a
great
presence
of
mind
in
their
distress
than
any
people
that
ever
he
meet
with
;
that
their
unhappy
nation
,
and
the
Portuguese
,
be
the
bad
man
in
the
world
to
struggle
with
misfortune
;
for
that
their
first
step
in
danger
,
after
common
effort
be
over
,
be
always
to
despair
,
lie
down
under
it
and
die
,
without
rouse
their
thought
up
to
proper
remedy
for
escape
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
their
case
and
mine
differ
exceedingly
;
that
they
be
cast
upon
the
shore
without
necessary
,
without
supply
of
food
,
or
of
present
sustenance
,
till
they
could
provide
it
;
that
it
be
true
,
I
have
this
disadvantage
and
discomfort
,
that
I
be
alone
;
but
then
the
supply
I
have
providentially
throw
into
my
hand
,
by
the
unexpected
driving
of
the
ship
on
shore
,
be
such
a
help
as
would
have
encourage
any
creature
in
the
world
to
have
apply
himself
as
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Seignior
,
"
say
the
Spaniard
,
"
have
we
poor
Spaniards
be
in
your
case
we
should
never
have
get
half
those
thing
out
of
the
ship
as
you
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
should
never
have
find
mean
to
have
get
a
raft
to
carry
them
,
or
to
have
get
a
raft
on
shore
without
boat
or
sail
;
and
how
much
less
should
we
have
do
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
any
of
us
have
be
alone
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
desire
him
to
abate
his
compliment
,
and
go
on
with
the
history
of
their
come
on
shore
,
where
they
land
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
they
unhappily
land
at
a
place
where
there
be
people
without
provision
;
whereas
,
have
they
have
the
common
sense
to
have
put
off
to
sea
again
,
and
go
to
another
island
a
little
farther
<EOS>
,
they
have
find
provision
though
without
people
;
there
be
an
island
that
way
,
as
they
have
be
tell
,
where
there
be
provision
though
no
people
;
that
be
to
say
,
that
the
Spaniards
of
Trinidad
have
frequently
be
there
,
and
fill
the
island
with
goat
and
hog
at
several
time
,
where
they
have
breed
in
such
multitude
,
and
where
turtle
and
sea
-
fowl
be
in
such
plenty
,
that
they
could
have
be
in
no
want
of
flesh
though
they
have
find
no
bread
;
whereas
here
they
be
only
sustain
with
a
few
root
and
herb
,
which
they
understand
not
,
and
which
have
no
substance
in
them
,
and
which
the
inhabitant
give
them
sparingly
enough
,
and
who
could
treat
them
no
better
unless
they
would
turn
cannibal
,
and
eat
man
's
flesh
,
which
be
the
great
dainty
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
They
give
me
an
account
how
many
way
they
strove
to
civilize
the
savage
they
be
with
,
and
to
teach
them
rational
custom
in
the
ordinary
way
of
living
,
but
in
vain
;
and
how
they
retort
it
upon
them
as
unjust
,
that
they
,
who
come
thither
for
assistance
and
support
,
should
attempt
to
set
up
for
instructor
of
those
that
give
them
bread
;
intimate
,
it
seem
,
that
none
should
set
up
for
the
instructor
of
other
but
those
who
could
live
without
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
give
me
dismal
account
of
the
extremity
they
be
drive
to
;
how
sometimes
they
be
many
day
without
any
food
at
all
,
the
island
they
be
upon
be
inhabit
by
a
sort
of
savage
that
live
more
indolent
,
and
for
that
reason
be
less
supplied
with
the
necessary
of
life
than
they
have
reason
to
believe
other
be
in
the
same
part
of
the
world
;
and
yet
they
find
that
these
savage
be
less
ravenous
and
voracious
than
those
who
have
well
supply
of
food
.
  
<EOS>
also
they
add
,
that
they
could
not
but
see
with
what
demonstration
of
wisdom
and
goodness
the
govern
providence
of
God
direct
the
event
of
thing
in
the
world
,
which
they
say
appear
in
their
circumstance
;
for
if
,
press
by
the
hardship
they
be
under
,
and
the
barrenness
of
the
country
where
they
be
,
they
have
search
after
a
well
place
to
live
in
,
they
have
then
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
relief
that
happen
to
them
by
my
mean
.
  
<EOS>
then
they
give
me
an
account
how
the
savage
whom
they
live
among
expect
them
to
go
out
with
them
into
their
war
;
and
it
be
true
,
that
as
they
have
fire
-
arm
with
them
,
have
they
not
have
the
disaster
to
lose
their
ammunition
,
they
should
not
have
be
serviceable
only
to
their
friend
,
but
have
make
themselves
terrible
both
to
friend
and
enemy
;
but
be
without
powder
and
shot
,
and
in
a
condition
that
they
could
not
in
reason
deny
to
go
out
with
their
landlord
to
their
war
;
when
they
come
in
the
field
of
battle
they
be
in
a
bad
condition
than
the
savage
themselves
,
for
they
neither
have
bow
nor
arrow
,
nor
could
they
use
those
the
savage
give
them
,
so
that
they
could
do
nothing
but
stand
still
and
be
wound
with
arrow
,
till
they
come
up
to
the
tooth
of
their
enemy
;
and
then
indeed
the
three
halbert
they
have
be
of
use
to
them
,
and
they
would
often
drive
a
whole
little
army
before
them
with
those
halbert
and
sharpen
stick
put
into
the
muzzle
of
their
musket
:
but
that
for
all
this
,
they
be
sometimes
surround
with
multitude
,
and
in
great
danger
from
their
arrow
;
till
at
last
they
find
the
way
to
make
themselves
large
target
of
wood
,
which
they
cover
with
skin
of
wild
beast
,
whose
name
they
know
not
,
and
these
cover
them
from
the
arrow
of
the
savage
;
that
notwithstanding
these
,
they
be
sometimes
in
great
danger
,
and
be
once
five
of
them
knock
down
together
with
the
club
of
the
savage
,
which
be
the
time
when
one
of
them
be
take
prisoner
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
Spaniard
whom
I
have
relieve
;
that
at
first
they
think
he
have
be
kill
,
<EOS>
but
when
afterwards
they
hear
he
be
take
prisoner
,
they
be
under
the
great
grief
imaginable
,
and
would
willingly
have
all
venture
their
life
to
have
rescue
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
that
when
they
be
so
knock
down
,
the
rest
of
their
company
rescue
them
,
and
stand
over
them
fight
till
they
be
come
to
themselves
,
all
but
he
who
they
think
have
be
dead
;
and
then
they
make
their
way
with
their
halbert
and
piece
,
stand
close
together
in
a
line
,
through
a
body
of
above
a
thousand
savage
,
beat
down
all
that
come
in
their
way
,
get
the
victory
over
their
enemy
,
but
to
their
great
sorrow
,
because
it
be
with
the
loss
of
their
friend
;
whom
the
other
party
,
find
him
alive
,
carry
off
with
some
other
,
as
I
give
an
account
in
my
former
.
  
<EOS>
They
describe
,
most
affectionately
,
how
they
be
surprised
with
joy
at
the
return
of
their
friend
and
companion
in
misery
,
who
they
think
have
be
devour
by
wild
beast
of
the
bad
kind
,
viz
.
<EOS>
by
wild
man
;
and
yet
how
more
and
more
they
be
surprised
with
the
account
he
give
them
of
his
errand
,
and
that
there
be
a
Christian
in
a
place
near
,
much
more
one
that
be
able
,
and
have
humanity
enough
to
contribute
to
their
deliverance
.
  
<EOS>
They
describe
how
they
be
astonish
at
the
sight
of
the
relief
I
send
them
,
and
at
the
appearance
of
loaf
of
bread
,
thing
they
have
not
see
since
their
come
to
that
miserable
place
;
how
often
they
cross
it
,
and
bless
it
as
bread
send
from
heaven
;
and
what
a
reviving
cordial
it
be
to
their
spirit
to
taste
it
,
as
also
of
the
other
thing
I
have
send
for
their
supply
.
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
they
would
have
tell
me
something
of
the
joy
they
be
in
at
the
sight
of
a
boat
and
pilot
to
carry
them
away
to
the
person
and
place
from
whence
all
these
new
comfort
come
;
but
they
tell
me
it
be
impossible
to
express
it
by
word
,
for
their
excessive
joy
drive
them
to
unbecoming
extravagancy
,
they
have
no
way
to
describe
them
but
by
tell
me
that
they
border
upon
lunacy
,
have
no
way
to
give
vent
to
their
passion
suitable
to
the
sense
that
be
upon
them
;
that
in
some
it
work
one
way
,
and
in
some
another
;
and
that
some
of
them
,
through
a
surprise
of
joy
,
would
burst
out
into
tear
;
other
be
half
mad
,
and
other
immediately
faint
.
<EOS>
this
discourse
extremely
affect
me
,
and
call
to
my
mind
Friday
's
ecstasy
when
he
meet
his
father
,
and
the
poor
people
's
ecstasy
when
I
take
them
up
at
sea
,
after
their
ship
be
on
fire
;
the
mate
of
the
ship
's
joy
,
when
he
find
himself
deliver
in
the
place
where
he
expect
to
perish
;
and
my
own
joy
,
when
after
twenty
-
eight
year
captivity
I
find
a
good
ship
ready
to
carry
me
to
my
own
country
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
make
me
more
sensible
of
the
relation
of
these
poor
man
,
and
more
affected
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
give
a
view
of
the
state
of
thing
as
I
find
them
,
I
must
relate
the
head
of
what
I
do
for
these
people
,
and
the
condition
in
which
I
leave
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
their
opinion
,
and
mine
too
,
that
they
would
be
trouble
no
more
with
the
savage
;
or
that
,
if
they
be
,
they
would
be
able
to
cut
them
off
,
if
they
be
twice
as
many
as
before
;
so
that
they
have
no
concern
about
that
.
<EOS>
then
I
enter
into
a
serious
discourse
with
the
Spaniard
whom
I
call
governor
,
about
their
stay
in
the
island
;
for
as
I
be
not
come
to
carry
any
of
them
off
,
so
it
would
not
be
just
to
carry
off
some
and
leave
other
,
who
perhaps
would
be
unwilling
to
stay
if
their
strength
be
diminish
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
I
tell
them
,
I
come
to
establish
them
there
,
not
to
remove
them
;
and
then
I
let
them
know
that
I
have
bring
with
me
relief
of
sundry
kind
for
them
;
that
I
have
be
at
a
great
charge
to
supply
them
with
all
thing
necessary
,
as
well
for
their
convenience
as
their
defence
;
and
that
I
have
such
particular
person
with
me
,
as
well
to
increase
and
recruit
their
number
,
as
by
the
particular
necessary
employment
which
they
be
breed
to
,
be
artificer
,
to
assist
them
in
those
thing
in
which
at
present
they
be
to
seek
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
all
together
when
I
talk
thus
to
them
;
and
before
I
deliver
to
them
the
store
I
have
bring
,
I
ask
them
,
one
by
one
,
if
they
have
entirely
forget
and
bury
the
first
animosity
that
have
be
among
them
,
and
could
shake
hand
with
one
another
,
and
engage
in
a
strict
friendship
and
union
of
interest
,
so
that
there
may
be
no
more
misunderstanding
or
jealousy
.
  
<EOS>
William
Atkins
,
with
abundance
of
frankness
and
good
humour
,
say
,
they
have
meet
with
affliction
enough
to
make
them
all
sober
,
and
enemy
enough
to
make
them
all
friend
:
that
for
his
part
he
would
live
and
die
with
them
;
and
be
so
far
from
design
any
thing
against
the
Spaniards
,
that
he
own
they
have
do
nothing
to
him
but
what
his
own
bad
humour
make
necessary
,
and
what
he
would
have
do
,
and
perhaps
much
bad
,
in
their
case
;
and
that
he
would
ask
them
pardon
,
if
I
desire
it
,
for
the
foolish
and
brutish
thing
he
have
do
to
them
;
and
be
very
willing
and
desirous
of
live
on
term
of
entire
friendship
and
union
with
them
;
and
would
do
any
thing
that
lie
in
his
power
,
to
convince
them
of
it
:
and
as
for
go
to
England
,
he
care
not
if
he
do
not
go
thither
these
twenty
year
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
say
,
they
have
indeed
at
first
disarm
and
exclude
William
Atkins
and
his
two
countryman
,
for
their
ill
conduct
,
as
they
have
let
me
know
;
and
they
appeal
to
me
for
the
necessity
they
be
under
to
do
so
;
but
that
William
Atkins
have
behave
himself
so
bravely
in
the
great
fight
they
have
with
the
savage
,
and
on
several
occasion
since
,
and
have
shew
himself
so
faithful
to
,
and
concern
for
the
general
interest
of
them
all
,
that
they
have
forget
all
that
be
past
,
and
think
he
merit
as
much
to
be
trust
with
arm
,
and
supply
with
necessary
,
as
any
of
them
;
and
that
they
have
testify
their
satisfaction
in
him
,
by
commit
the
command
to
him
,
next
to
the
governor
himself
;
and
as
they
have
an
entire
confidence
in
him
and
all
his
countryman
,
so
they
acknowledge
they
have
merit
that
confidence
by
all
the
method
that
honest
man
could
merit
to
be
value
and
trust
;
and
they
most
heartily
embrace
the
occasion
of
give
me
this
assurance
,
that
they
would
never
have
any
interest
separate
from
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
frank
and
open
declaration
of
friendship
,
we
appoint
the
next
day
to
dine
all
together
,
and
indeed
we
make
a
splendid
feast
.
<EOS>
I
cause
the
ship
's
cook
and
his
mate
to
come
on
shore
and
dress
our
dinner
,
and
the
old
cook
's
mate
we
have
on
shore
assist
.
<EOS>
We
bring
on
shore
six
piece
of
good
beef
,
and
four
piece
of
pork
,
out
of
the
ship
's
provision
,
with
our
punch
-
bowl
,
and
material
to
fill
it
;
and
,
in
particular
,
I
give
them
ten
bottle
of
french
claret
,
and
ten
bottle
of
english
beer
,
thing
that
neither
the
Spaniards
nor
the
englishman
have
taste
for
many
year
;
and
which
it
may
be
suppose
they
be
exceed
glad
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
add
to
our
feast
five
whole
kid
,
which
the
cook
roast
;
and
three
of
them
be
send
,
cover
up
close
,
on
board
our
ship
to
the
seaman
,
that
they
may
feast
on
fresh
meat
from
on
shore
,
as
we
do
with
their
salt
meal
from
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
feast
,
at
which
we
be
very
innocently
merry
,
I
bring
out
my
cargo
of
good
,
wherein
,
that
there
may
be
no
dispute
about
divide
<EOS>
,
I
shew
them
that
there
be
sufficient
for
them
all
;
and
desire
that
they
may
all
take
an
equal
quantity
of
the
good
that
be
for
wear
;
that
be
to
say
,
equal
when
make
up
.
<EOS>
as
first
,
I
distribute
linen
sufficient
to
make
every
one
of
them
four
shirt
;
and
,
at
the
Spaniards
'
request
,
afterwards
make
them
up
six
;
these
be
exceed
comfortable
to
them
,
have
be
what
,
as
I
may
say
,
they
have
long
since
forget
the
use
of
,
or
what
it
be
to
wear
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
allot
the
thin
english
stuff
,
which
I
mention
before
,
to
make
every
one
a
light
coat
like
a
frock
,
which
I
judge
fit
for
the
heat
of
the
season
,
cool
and
loose
;
and
order
,
that
whenever
they
decay
,
they
should
make
more
,
as
they
think
fit
.
<EOS>
the
like
for
pump
,
shoe
,
stocking
,
and
hats
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
what
pleasure
,
what
satisfaction
,
sit
upon
the
countenance
of
all
these
poor
man
when
they
see
the
care
I
have
take
of
them
,
and
how
well
I
have
furnish
them
;
they
tell
me
I
be
a
father
to
them
;
and
that
have
such
a
correspondent
as
I
be
,
in
so
remote
a
part
of
the
world
,
it
would
make
them
forget
that
they
be
leave
in
a
desolate
place
;
and
they
all
voluntarily
engage
to
me
not
to
leave
the
place
without
my
consent
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
present
to
them
the
people
I
have
bring
with
me
,
particularly
the
tailor
,
the
smith
,
and
the
two
carpenter
,
all
of
them
most
necessary
people
;
but
above
all
,
my
general
artificer
,
than
whom
they
could
not
name
any
thing
that
be
more
needful
to
them
;
and
the
tailor
,
to
shew
his
concern
for
them
,
go
to
work
immediately
,
and
,
with
my
leave
,
make
them
every
one
a
shirt
<EOS>
the
first
thing
he
do
;
and
,
which
be
still
more
<EOS>
,
he
teach
the
woman
not
only
how
to
sew
and
stitch
,
and
use
the
needle
,
but
make
them
assist
to
make
the
shirt
for
their
husband
and
for
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
carpenter
,
I
scarce
need
<EOS>
mention
how
useful
they
be
,
for
they
take
in
piece
all
my
clumsy
unhandy
thing
,
and
make
them
clever
convenient
table
,
stool
,
bedstead
,
cupboard
,
locker
,
shelf
,
and
every
thing
they
want
of
that
kind
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
let
them
see
how
nature
make
artificer
at
first
,
I
carry
the
carpenter
to
see
William
Atkins
's
basket
house
,
as
I
call
it
,
and
they
both
own
they
never
see
an
instance
of
such
natural
ingenuity
before
,
nor
any
thing
so
regular
and
so
handily
build
,
at
least
of
its
kind
;
and
one
of
them
,
when
he
see
it
,
after
muse
a
good
while
,
turn
about
to
me
,
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
that
man
have
no
need
of
us
;
you
need
do
nothing
but
give
him
tool
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
I
bring
them
out
all
my
store
of
tool
,
and
give
every
man
a
dig
spade
,
a
shovel
,
and
a
rake
,
for
we
have
no
harrow
or
plough
;
and
to
every
separate
place
a
pickaxe
,
a
crow
,
a
broadaxe
,
and
a
saw
;
always
appoint
,
that
as
often
as
any
be
break
,
or
wear
out
,
they
should
be
supply
,
without
grudge
,
out
of
the
general
store
that
I
leave
behind
.
  
<EOS>
nail
,
staple
,
hinge
,
hammer
,
chisel
,
knife
,
scissor
,
and
all
sort
of
tool
and
iron
-
work
,
they
have
without
tale
as
they
require
;
for
no
man
would
care
to
take
more
than
he
want
,
and
he
must
be
a
fool
that
would
waste
or
spoil
them
on
any
account
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
use
of
the
smith
I
leave
two
ton
of
unwrought
iron
for
a
supply
.
  
<EOS>
My
magazine
of
powder
and
arm
which
I
bring
them
,
be
such
,
even
to
profusion
,
that
they
could
not
but
rejoice
at
them
;
for
now
they
could
march
,
as
I
use
to
do
,
with
a
musket
upon
each
shoulder
,
if
there
be
occasion
;
and
be
able
to
fight
a
thousand
savage
,
if
they
have
but
some
little
advantage
of
situation
,
which
also
they
could
not
miss
of
if
they
have
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
carry
on
shore
with
me
the
young
man
whose
mother
be
starve
to
death
,
and
the
maid
also
<EOS>
:
she
be
a
sober
,
well
-
educate
,
religious
young
woman
,
and
behave
so
inoffensively
,
that
every
one
give
her
a
good
word
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
an
unhappy
life
with
us
,
there
be
no
woman
in
the
ship
but
herself
;
but
she
bear
it
with
patience
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
see
thing
so
well
order
,
and
in
so
fine
a
way
of
thrive
upon
my
island
,
and
consider
that
they
have
neither
business
nor
acquaintance
in
the
East
Indies
,
or
reason
for
take
so
long
a
voyage
;
I
say
,
consider
all
this
,
both
of
them
come
to
me
,
and
desire
I
would
give
them
leave
to
remain
on
the
island
,
and
be
enter
among
my
family
,
as
they
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
agree
to
it
readily
,
and
they
have
a
little
plot
of
ground
allot
to
them
,
where
they
have
three
tent
or
house
set
up
,
surround
with
a
basket
-
work
,
palisade
like
Atkins
's
,
and
adjoin
to
his
plantation
.
<EOS>
Their
tent
be
contrive
so
,
that
they
have
each
of
them
a
room
,
a
part
to
lodge
in
,
and
a
middle
tent
,
like
a
great
storehouse
,
to
lay
all
their
good
in
,
and
to
eat
and
drink
in
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
other
two
englishman
move
their
habitation
to
the
same
place
,
and
so
the
island
be
divide
into
three
colony
,
and
no
more
;
viz
.
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
,
with
old
Friday
,
and
the
first
servant
,
at
my
old
habitation
under
the
hill
,
which
be
,
in
a
word
,
the
capital
city
,
and
where
they
have
so
enlarge
and
extend
their
work
,
as
well
under
as
on
the
outside
of
the
hill
,
that
they
live
,
though
perfectly
conceal
,
yet
full
at
large
.
<EOS>
never
be
there
such
a
little
city
in
a
wood
,
and
so
hid
,
I
believe
<EOS>
,
in
any
part
of
the
world
;
for
I
verily
believe
a
thousand
man
may
have
range
the
island
a
month
,
and
if
they
have
not
know
there
be
such
a
thing
,
and
look
on
purpose
for
it
,
they
would
not
have
find
it
;
for
the
tree
stand
so
thick
and
so
close
,
and
grow
so
fast
mat
into
one
another
,
that
nothing
but
cut
them
down
first
,
could
discover
the
place
,
except
the
two
narrow
entrance
where
they
go
in
and
out
,
could
be
find
,
which
be
not
very
easy
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
just
down
at
the
water
's
edge
,
on
the
side
of
the
creek
;
and
it
be
afterwards
above
two
hundred
yard
to
the
place
;
and
the
other
be
up
the
ladder
at
twice
,
as
I
have
already
formerly
describe
it
;
and
they
have
a
large
wood
,
thick
plant
,
also
on
the
top
of
the
hill
,
which
contain
above
an
acre
,
which
grow
apace
,
and
cover
the
place
from
all
discovery
there
,
with
only
one
narrow
place
between
two
tree
,
not
easy
to
be
discover
,
to
enter
on
that
side
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
colony
be
that
of
Will
Atkins
,
where
there
be
four
family
of
Englishmen
,
I
mean
those
I
have
leave
there
,
with
their
wife
and
child
;
three
savage
that
be
slave
;
the
widow
and
child
of
the
Englishman
that
be
kill
;
the
young
man
and
the
maid
;
and
by
the
way
,
we
make
a
wife
of
her
also
before
we
go
away
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
the
two
carpenter
and
the
tailor
,
whom
I
bring
with
me
for
them
;
also
the
smith
,
who
be
a
very
necessary
man
to
them
,
especially
as
the
gunsmith
,
to
take
care
of
their
arm
;
and
my
other
man
,
whom
I
call
Jack
of
all
Trades
,
who
be
himself
as
good
almost
as
twenty
man
,
for
<EOS>
he
be
not
only
a
very
ingenious
fellow
,
but
a
very
merry
fellow
;
and
before
I
go
away
<EOS>
we
marry
him
to
the
honest
maid
that
come
with
the
youth
in
the
ship
,
whom
I
mention
before
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
speak
of
marrying
<EOS>
,
it
bring
me
naturally
to
say
something
of
the
french
ecclesiastic
that
I
have
bring
with
me
out
of
the
ship
's
crew
whom
I
take
at
sea
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
this
man
be
a
Roman
,
and
perhaps
it
may
give
offence
to
some
hereafter
,
if
I
leave
any
thing
extraordinary
upon
record
of
a
man
,
whom
,
before
I
begin
,
I
must
(
to
set
him
out
in
just
colour
)
represent
in
term
very
much
to
his
disadvantage
in
the
account
of
Protestants
;
as
,
first
,
that
he
be
a
papist
;
secondly
,
a
popish
priest
;
and
thirdly
,
a
french
popish
priest
.
  
<EOS>
but
justice
demand
of
me
to
give
him
a
due
character
;
and
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
he
be
a
grave
,
sober
,
pious
,
and
most
religious
person
;
exact
in
his
life
,
extensive
in
his
charity
,
and
exemplary
in
almost
every
thing
he
do
.
<EOS>
what
then
can
any
one
say
against
my
be
very
sensible
of
the
value
of
such
a
man
,
notwithstanding
his
profession
?
<EOS>
though
it
may
be
my
opinion
,
perhaps
as
well
as
the
opinion
of
other
who
shall
read
this
,
that
he
be
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
hour
that
I
begin
to
converse
with
him
,
after
he
have
agree
to
go
with
me
to
the
East
Indies
,
I
find
reason
to
delight
exceedingly
in
his
conversation
;
and
he
first
begin
with
me
about
religion
,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
have
not
only
,
under
God
"
(
and
at
that
he
cross
his
breast
)
,
"
save
my
life
,
but
you
have
admit
me
to
go
this
voyage
in
your
ship
,
and
by
your
oblige
civility
have
take
me
into
your
family
,
give
me
an
opportunity
of
free
conversation
.
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
see
by
my
habit
what
my
profession
be
,
and
I
guess
by
your
nation
what
yours
be
.
<EOS>
I
may
think
it
be
my
duty
,
and
doubtless
it
be
so
,
to
use
my
utmost
endeavour
on
all
occasion
to
bring
all
the
soul
that
I
can
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
,
and
to
embrace
the
catholic
doctrine
;
but
as
I
be
here
under
your
permission
,
and
in
your
family
,
I
be
bind
in
justice
to
your
kindness
,
as
well
as
in
decency
and
good
manner
,
to
be
under
your
government
;
and
therefore
I
shall
not
,
without
your
leave
,
enter
into
any
debate
on
the
point
of
religion
,
in
which
we
may
not
agree
,
farther
than
you
shall
give
me
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
his
carriage
be
so
modest
that
I
could
not
but
acknowledge
it
;
that
it
be
true
,
we
be
such
people
as
they
call
heretic
,
but
that
he
be
not
the
first
Catholic
that
I
have
converse
with
without
fall
into
any
inconveniencie
,
or
carry
the
question
to
any
height
in
debate
;
that
he
should
not
find
himself
the
worse
use
for
be
of
a
different
opinion
from
us
;
and
if
we
do
not
converse
without
any
dislike
on
either
side
,
upon
that
score
,
it
would
be
his
fault
,
not
ours
.
  
<EOS>
He
reply
,
that
he
think
our
conversation
may
be
easily
separate
from
dispute
;
that
it
be
not
his
business
to
cap
principle
with
every
man
he
discourse
with
;
and
that
he
rather
desire
me
to
converse
with
him
as
a
gentleman
than
as
a
religieux
;
that
if
I
would
give
him
leave
at
any
time
to
discourse
upon
religious
subject
,
he
would
readily
comply
with
it
;
and
that
then
he
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
would
allow
him
also
to
defend
his
own
opinion
as
well
as
he
could
;
but
that
without
my
leave
he
would
not
break
in
upon
me
with
any
such
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
farther
,
that
he
would
not
cease
to
do
all
that
become
him
in
his
office
as
a
priest
,
as
well
as
a
private
Christian
,
to
procure
the
good
of
the
ship
,
and
the
safety
of
all
that
be
in
her
;
and
though
perhaps
we
would
not
join
with
him
,
and
he
could
not
pray
with
us
,
he
hope
he
may
pray
for
us
,
which
he
would
do
upon
all
occasion
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
we
converse
;
and
as
he
be
of
a
most
obliging
gentleman
-
like
behaviour
,
so
he
be
,
if
I
may
be
allow
to
say
so
,
a
man
of
good
sense
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
of
great
learning
.
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
most
divert
account
of
his
life
,
and
of
the
many
extraordinary
event
of
it
;
of
many
adventure
which
have
befall
him
in
the
few
year
that
he
have
be
abroad
in
the
world
,
and
particularly
this
be
very
remarkable
;
viz
.
<EOS>
that
during
the
voyage
he
be
now
engage
in
he
have
the
misfortune
to
be
five
time
ship
and
unshipped
,
and
never
to
go
to
the
place
whither
<EOS>
any
of
the
ship
he
be
in
be
at
first
design
:
that
his
first
intent
be
to
have
go
to
Martinico
,
and
that
he
go
on
board
a
ship
bind
thither
at
St.
Maloes
;
but
be
force
into
Lisbon
in
bad
weather
,
the
ship
receive
some
damage
by
run
aground
in
the
mouth
of
the
river
Tagus
,
and
be
oblige
to
unload
her
cargo
there
:
that
find
a
portuguese
ship
there
,
bind
to
the
Madeiras
,
and
ready
to
sail
,
and
suppose
he
should
easily
meet
with
a
vessel
there
bind
to
Martinico
,
he
go
on
board
in
order
to
sail
to
the
Madeiras
;
but
the
master
of
the
portuguese
ship
be
but
an
indifferent
mariner
,
have
be
out
in
his
reckoning
,
and
they
drive
to
Fyal
;
where
,
however
,
he
happen
to
find
a
very
good
market
for
his
cargo
,
which
be
corn
,
and
therefore
resolve
not
to
go
to
the
Madeiras
,
but
to
load
salt
at
the
isle
of
May
,
to
go
away
to
Newfoundland
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
remedy
in
the
exigence
but
to
go
with
the
ship
,
and
have
a
pretty
good
voyage
as
far
as
the
Banks
,
(
so
they
call
the
place
where
they
catch
the
fish
)
<EOS>
where
meet
with
a
french
ship
bind
from
France
to
Quebec
,
in
the
river
of
Canada
,
and
from
thence
to
Martinico
,
to
carry
provision
,
he
think
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
complete
his
first
design
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
to
Quebec
the
master
of
the
ship
die
,
and
the
ship
proceed
no
farther
.
<EOS>
so
the
next
voyage
he
ship
himself
for
France
,
in
the
ship
that
be
burn
,
when
we
take
them
up
at
sea
,
and
then
ship
them
with
us
for
the
East
Indies
,
as
I
have
already
say
.
<EOS>
thus
he
have
be
disappoint
in
five
voyage
,
all
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
one
voyage
,
besides
what
I
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
farther
of
the
same
person
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
make
digression
into
other
man
's
story
which
have
no
relation
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
what
concern
our
affair
in
the
island
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
one
morning
,
for
he
lodge
among
us
<EOS>
all
the
while
we
be
upon
the
island
,
and
it
happen
to
be
just
when
I
be
go
to
visit
the
Englishmen
's
colony
at
the
farth
part
of
the
island
;
I
say
,
he
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
with
a
very
grave
countenance
,
that
he
have
for
two
or
three
day
desire
an
opportunity
of
some
discourse
with
me
,
which
he
hope
would
not
be
displeasing
to
me
,
because
he
think
it
may
in
some
measure
correspond
with
my
general
design
,
which
be
the
prosperity
of
my
new
colony
,
and
perhaps
may
put
it
at
least
more
than
he
yet
think
it
be
in
the
way
of
God
's
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
a
little
surprised
at
the
last
part
of
his
discourse
,
and
turn
a
little
short
,
"
how
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
can
it
be
say
,
that
we
be
not
in
the
way
of
God
's
blessing
,
after
such
visible
assistance
and
wonderful
deliverance
as
we
have
see
here
,
and
of
which
I
have
give
you
a
large
account
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
please
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
world
of
modesty
,
and
yet
with
great
readiness
,
"
<EOS>
to
have
hear
me
,
you
would
have
find
no
room
to
have
be
displease
,
much
less
to
think
so
hard
of
me
,
that
I
should
suggest
,
that
you
have
not
have
wonderful
assistance
and
deliverance
;
and
I
hope
,
on
your
behalf
,
that
you
be
in
the
way
of
God
's
blessing
,
and
your
design
be
exceed
good
,
and
will
prosper
.
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
it
be
more
so
than
be
even
possible
to
you
,
yet
there
may
be
some
among
you
that
be
not
equally
right
in
their
action
;
and
you
know
that
in
the
story
of
Israel
,
one
Achan
,
in
the
camp
,
remove
God
's
blessing
from
them
,
and
turn
his
hand
so
against
them
,
that
thirty
-
six
of
them
,
though
not
concern
in
the
crime
,
be
the
object
of
divine
vengeance
,
and
bear
the
weight
of
that
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
sensibly
touch
with
this
discourse
,
and
tell
him
his
inference
be
so
just
,
and
the
whole
design
seem
so
sincere
,
and
be
really
so
religious
in
its
own
nature
,
that
I
be
very
sorry
I
have
interrupt
him
,
and
beg
him
to
go
on
;
and
in
the
meantime
,
because
it
seem
that
what
we
have
both
to
say
may
take
up
some
time
,
I
tell
him
I
be
go
to
the
Englishmens
'
plantation
,
and
ask
him
to
go
with
me
,
and
we
may
discourse
of
it
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
would
more
willingly
wait
on
me
thither
,
because
there
,
partly
,
the
thing
be
act
which
he
desire
to
speak
to
me
about
.
<EOS>
so
we
walk
on
,
and
I
press
him
to
be
free
and
plain
with
me
in
what
he
have
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
pleased
to
give
me
leave
to
lay
down
a
few
proposition
as
the
foundation
of
what
I
have
to
say
,
that
we
may
not
differ
in
the
general
principle
,
though
we
may
be
of
some
differ
opinion
in
the
practice
of
particular
.
<EOS>
first
,
Sir
,
though
we
differ
in
some
of
the
doctrinal
article
of
religion
,
and
it
be
very
unhappy
that
it
be
so
,
especially
in
the
case
before
us
,
as
I
shall
shew
afterwards
,
yet
there
be
some
general
principle
in
which
we
both
agree
;
viz
.
<EOS>
first
,
that
there
be
a
God
,
and
that
this
God
,
have
give
us
some
state
general
rule
for
our
service
and
obedience
,
we
ought
not
willingly
and
knowingly
to
offend
him
,
either
by
neglect
to
do
what
he
have
command
,
or
by
do
what
he
have
expressly
forbid
;
and
let
our
different
religion
be
what
they
will
,
this
general
principle
be
readily
own
by
us
all
,
that
the
blessing
of
God
do
not
ordinarily
follow
a
presumptuous
sinning
against
his
command
;
and
every
good
Christian
will
be
affectionately
concerned
to
prevent
any
that
be
under
his
care
,
live
in
a
total
neglect
of
God
and
his
command
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
your
man
be
Protestants
,
whatever
my
opinion
may
be
of
such
,
that
discharge
me
from
be
concern
for
their
soul
,
and
from
endeavour
,
if
it
lie
before
me
,
that
they
should
live
in
as
little
distance
from
and
enmity
with
their
maker
as
possible
;
especially
if
you
give
me
leave
to
meddle
so
far
in
your
circuit
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
not
yet
imagine
,
what
he
aim
at
,
and
tell
him
I
grant
all
he
have
say
;
and
thank
him
that
he
would
so
far
concern
himself
for
us
;
and
beg
he
would
explain
the
particular
of
what
he
have
observe
,
that
,
like
Joshua
,
(
to
take
his
own
parable
)
I
may
put
away
the
accurse
thing
from
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
take
the
liberty
you
give
me
;
and
there
be
three
thing
which
,
if
I
be
right
,
must
stand
in
the
way
of
God
's
blessing
upon
your
endeavour
here
,
and
which
I
should
rejoice
,
for
your
sake
,
and
their
own
,
to
see
remove
.
<EOS>
and
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
promise
myself
that
you
will
fully
agree
with
me
in
them
all
as
soon
as
I
name
them
;
especially
because
I
shall
convince
you
that
every
one
of
them
may
with
great
ease
,
and
very
much
to
your
satisfaction
,
be
remedie
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
no
leave
to
put
in
any
more
civility
,
but
go
on
:
"
<EOS>
First
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
have
here
four
englishman
,
who
have
fetch
woman
from
among
the
savage
,
and
have
take
them
as
their
wife
,
and
have
have
many
child
by
them
all
,
and
yet
be
not
married
to
them
after
any
stated
legal
manner
,
as
the
law
of
God
and
man
require
;
and
therefore
be
yet
,
in
the
sense
of
both
,
no
less
than
adulterer
,
and
live
in
adultery
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
know
you
will
object
,
that
there
be
no
clergyman
or
priest
of
any
kind
,
or
of
any
profession
,
to
perform
the
ceremony
;
nor
any
pen
and
ink
,
or
paper
,
to
write
down
a
contract
of
marriage
,
and
have
it
sign
between
them
.
<EOS>
and
I
know
also
,
Sir
,
what
the
Spaniard
governor
have
tell
you
;
I
mean
of
the
agreement
that
he
oblige
them
to
make
when
they
take
these
woman
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
they
should
choose
them
out
by
consent
,
and
keep
separately
to
them
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
nothing
of
a
marriage
,
no
agreement
with
the
woman
as
wife
,
but
only
an
agreement
among
themselves
,
to
keep
them
from
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Sir
,
the
essence
of
the
sacrament
of
matrimony
(
so
he
call
it
,
be
a
Roman
)
consist
not
only
in
the
mutual
consent
of
the
party
to
take
one
another
as
man
and
wife
,
but
in
the
formal
and
legal
obligation
that
there
be
in
the
contract
to
compel
the
man
and
woman
at
all
time
to
own
and
acknowledge
each
other
;
oblige
the
man
to
abstain
from
all
other
woman
,
to
engage
in
no
other
contract
while
these
subsist
;
and
on
all
occasion
,
as
ability
allow
,
to
provide
honestly
for
them
and
their
child
;
and
to
oblige
the
woman
to
the
same
,
on
like
condition
,
mutatis
mutandis
,
on
their
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
these
man
may
,
when
they
please
,
or
when
occasion
present
,
abandon
these
woman
,
disown
their
child
,
leave
them
to
perish
,
and
take
other
woman
and
marry
them
whilst
these
be
live
.
"
<EOS>
and
here
he
add
,
with
some
warmth
,
"
how
,
Sir
,
be
God
honour
in
this
unlawful
liberty
?
<EOS>
and
how
shall
a
blessing
succeed
your
endeavour
in
this
place
,
however
good
in
themselves
,
and
however
sincere
in
your
design
,
while
these
man
,
who
at
present
be
your
subject
,
under
your
absolute
government
and
dominion
,
be
allow
by
you
to
live
in
open
adultery
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
strike
at
the
thing
itself
,
but
much
more
with
the
convincing
argument
he
support
it
with
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
certainly
true
,
that
though
they
have
no
clergyman
on
the
spot
,
yet
a
formal
contract
on
both
side
,
make
before
witness
,
and
confirm
by
any
token
which
they
have
all
agree
to
be
bind
by
,
though
it
have
be
but
the
break
a
stick
between
them
,
engage
the
man
to
own
these
woman
for
their
wife
upon
all
occasion
,
and
never
to
abandon
them
or
their
child
,
and
the
woman
to
the
same
with
their
husband
,
have
be
an
effectual
lawful
marriage
in
the
sight
of
God
,
and
it
be
a
great
neglect
that
it
be
not
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
think
to
have
get
off
with
my
young
priest
by
tell
him
,
that
all
that
part
be
do
when
I
be
not
here
;
and
they
have
live
so
many
year
with
them
now
,
that
if
it
be
adultery
it
be
past
remedy
,
they
could
do
nothing
in
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
ask
your
pardon
for
such
freedom
,
you
be
right
in
this
;
that
it
be
do
in
your
absence
,
you
could
not
be
charge
with
that
part
of
the
crime
.
<EOS>
but
I
beseech
you
,
matter
not
yourself
that
you
be
not
therefore
under
an
obligation
to
do
your
uttermost
now
to
put
an
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
think
,
but
that
,
let
the
time
past
lie
on
whom
it
will
,
all
the
guilt
for
the
future
will
lie
entirely
upon
you
?
<EOS>
because
it
be
certainly
in
your
power
now
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
and
in
nobody
's
power
but
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
dull
still
,
that
I
do
not
take
him
right
,
but
I
imagine
that
by
put
an
end
to
it
he
mean
that
I
should
part
them
,
and
not
suffer
them
to
live
together
any
longer
;
and
I
say
to
him
I
could
not
do
that
by
any
mean
,
for
that
it
would
put
the
whole
island
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
seem
surprised
that
I
should
so
far
mistake
him
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
mean
that
you
should
separate
them
,
but
legally
and
effectually
marry
them
now
.
<EOS>
and
,
Sir
,
as
my
way
of
marrying
may
not
be
so
easy
to
reconcile
them
to
,
though
it
will
be
as
effectual
even
by
your
own
law
;
so
your
way
may
be
as
well
before
God
,
and
as
valid
among
man
;
I
mean
by
a
write
contract
sign
by
both
man
and
woman
,
and
by
all
the
witness
present
;
which
all
the
law
of
Europe
would
decree
to
be
valid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
to
see
so
much
true
piety
,
and
so
much
sincerity
of
zeal
,
besides
the
unusual
impartiality
in
his
discourse
,
as
to
his
own
party
or
church
,
and
such
a
true
warmth
for
the
preserve
people
that
he
have
no
knowledge
of
or
relation
to
;
I
say
,
for
preserve
them
from
transgress
the
law
of
God
;
the
like
of
which
I
have
indeed
not
meet
with
any
where
.
<EOS>
but
recollect
what
he
have
say
of
marry
them
by
a
write
contract
,
which
I
know
would
stand
too
,
I
return
it
back
upon
him
,
and
tell
him
I
grant
all
that
he
have
say
to
be
just
,
and
on
his
part
very
kind
;
that
I
would
discourse
with
the
man
upon
the
point
now
when
I
come
to
them
.
<EOS>
and
I
know
no
reason
why
they
should
scruple
to
let
him
marry
them
all
;
<EOS>
which
I
know
well
enough
would
be
grant
to
be
as
authentic
and
valid
in
England
as
if
they
be
marry
by
one
of
our
own
clergyman
.
<EOS>
what
be
afterwards
do
in
this
matter
I
shall
speak
of
by
itself
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
press
him
to
tell
me
what
be
the
second
complaint
which
he
have
to
make
,
acknowledge
I
be
very
much
his
debtor
for
the
first
,
and
thank
him
heartily
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
would
use
the
same
freedom
and
plainness
in
the
second
,
and
hope
I
would
take
it
as
well
;
and
this
be
,
that
notwithstanding
these
english
subject
of
mine
,
as
he
call
them
,
have
live
with
these
woman
for
almost
seven
year
,
and
have
teach
them
to
speak
English
,
and
even
to
read
it
,
and
that
they
be
,
as
he
perceive
,
woman
of
tolerable
understanding
and
capable
of
instruction
;
yet
they
have
not
,
to
this
hour
teach
them
any
thing
of
the
christian
religion
;
no
not
so
much
as
to
know
that
there
be
a
God
,
or
a
worship
,
or
in
what
manner
God
be
to
be
serve
;
or
that
their
own
idolatry
,
and
worship
they
know
not
who
,
be
false
and
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
he
say
,
be
an
unaccountable
neglect
,
and
what
God
would
certainly
call
them
to
an
account
for
;
and
perhaps
at
last
take
the
work
out
of
their
hand
.
<EOS>
He
speak
this
very
affectionately
and
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
persuade
,
"
say
he
,
"
have
those
man
live
in
the
savage
country
<EOS>
whence
their
wife
come
,
the
savage
would
have
take
more
pain
to
have
bring
them
to
be
idolater
,
and
to
worship
the
devil
,
than
any
of
these
man
,
so
far
as
I
can
see
,
have
take
with
them
to
teach
them
the
knowledge
of
the
true
God
.
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
I
do
not
acknowledge
your
religion
,
or
you
mine
,
yet
we
should
be
all
glad
to
see
the
devil
's
servant
,
and
the
subject
of
his
kingdom
,
teach
to
know
the
general
principle
of
the
christian
religion
;
that
they
may
at
least
hear
of
God
,
and
of
a
Redeemer
,
and
of
the
resurrection
,
and
of
a
future
state
,
thing
which
we
all
believe
;
they
have
at
least
be
so
much
nearer
come
into
the
bosom
of
the
true
church
,
than
they
be
now
in
the
public
profession
of
idolatry
and
devil
-
worship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
hold
no
longer
;
I
take
him
in
my
arm
,
and
embrace
him
with
an
excess
of
passion
.
<EOS>
"
how
far
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
have
I
be
from
understand
the
most
essential
part
of
a
Christian
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
love
the
interest
of
the
christian
church
,
and
the
good
of
other
man
's
soul
!
<EOS>
I
scarce
have
know
what
belong
to
be
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
,
Sir
,
do
not
say
so
,
"
reply
he
;
"
this
thing
be
not
your
fault
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
I
;
"
but
why
do
I
never
lay
it
to
heart
as
well
as
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
too
late
yet
,
"
say
he
;
"
be
not
too
forward
to
condemn
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
can
be
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
;
<EOS>
"
you
see
I
be
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
leave
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
talk
with
these
poor
man
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
I
will
oblige
them
to
give
heed
to
what
you
say
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
must
leave
them
to
the
mercy
of
Christ
;
but
it
be
our
business
to
assist
them
,
encourage
them
,
and
instruct
them
;
and
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
and
God
his
blessing
,
I
do
not
doubt
but
the
poor
ignorant
soul
shall
be
bring
home
into
the
great
circle
of
Christianity
,
if
not
into
the
particular
faith
that
we
all
embrace
;
and
that
even
while
you
stay
here
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
I
say
,
"
I
shall
not
only
give
you
leave
,
but
give
you
a
thousand
thank
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
what
follow
on
this
account
I
shall
mention
also
again
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
press
him
for
the
third
article
in
which
we
be
to
blame
.
<EOS>
"
why
really
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
of
the
same
nature
,
and
I
will
proceed
(
ask
your
leave
)
with
the
same
plainness
as
before
;
it
be
about
your
poor
savage
yonder
,
who
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
your
conquered
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
maxim
,
Sir
,
that
is
,
or
ought
to
be
receive
among
all
Christians
,
of
what
church
,
or
pretend
church
soever
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
christian
knowledge
ought
to
be
propagate
by
all
possible
mean
,
and
on
all
possible
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
principle
that
our
church
send
missionary
into
Persia
,
India
,
and
China
;
and
that
our
clergy
,
even
of
the
superior
sort
,
willingly
engage
in
the
most
hazardous
voyage
,
and
the
most
dangerous
residence
among
murderer
and
barbarian
,
to
teach
them
the
knowledge
of
the
true
God
,
and
to
bring
them
over
to
embrace
the
christian
faith
.
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
you
have
an
opportunity
here
to
have
six
or
seven
-
and
-
thirty
poor
savage
bring
over
from
idolatry
to
the
knowledge
of
God
,
their
Maker
and
Redeemer
,
that
I
wonder
how
you
can
pass
by
such
an
occasion
of
do
good
,
which
be
really
worth
the
expense
of
a
man
's
whole
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
strike
dumb
indeed
,
and
have
not
one
word
to
say
;
I
have
here
a
spirit
of
true
christian
zeal
for
God
and
religion
before
me
,
let
his
particular
principle
be
of
what
kind
soever
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
have
not
so
much
as
entertain
a
thought
of
this
in
my
heart
before
,
and
I
believe
should
not
have
think
of
it
;
for
I
look
upon
these
savage
as
slave
,
and
people
whom
,
have
we
any
work
for
them
to
do
,
we
would
have
use
as
such
,
or
would
have
be
glad
to
have
transport
them
to
any
other
part
of
the
world
;
for
our
business
be
to
get
rid
of
them
,
and
we
would
all
have
be
satisfied
if
they
have
be
send
to
any
country
,
so
they
have
never
see
their
own
.
<EOS>
but
to
the
case
:
I
say
I
be
confound
at
his
discourse
,
and
know
not
what
answer
to
make
him
.
<EOS>
He
look
earnestly
at
me
,
see
me
in
some
disorder
;
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
shall
be
very
sorry
,
if
what
I
have
say
give
you
any
offence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
offend
with
nobody
but
myself
;
but
I
be
perfectly
confound
,
not
only
to
think
that
I
should
never
take
any
notice
of
this
before
,
but
with
reflect
what
notice
I
be
able
to
take
of
it
now
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
circumstance
I
be
in
;
I
be
bind
to
the
East
Indies
,
in
a
ship
freight
by
merchant
,
and
to
whom
it
would
be
an
insufferable
piece
of
injustice
to
detain
their
ship
here
,
the
man
lie
all
this
while
at
victual
and
wage
upon
the
owner
'
account
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
I
agree
to
be
allow
twelve
day
here
,
and
if
I
stay
more
I
must
pay
32
sterling
per
diem
demurrage
;
nor
can
I
stay
upon
demurrage
above
eight
day
more
,
and
I
have
be
here
thirteen
day
already
;
so
that
I
be
perfectly
unable
to
engage
in
this
work
;
unless
I
would
suffer
myself
to
be
leave
behind
here
again
;
in
which
case
,
if
this
single
ship
should
miscarry
in
any
part
of
her
voyage
,
I
should
be
just
in
the
same
condition
that
I
be
leave
in
here
at
first
,
and
from
which
I
have
be
so
wonderfully
deliver
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
own
the
case
be
very
hard
upon
me
as
to
my
voyage
,
but
lay
it
home
upon
my
conscience
,
whether
the
blessing
of
save
seven
-
and
-
thirty
soul
be
not
worth
my
venture
all
I
have
in
the
world
for
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
sensible
of
that
as
he
be
,
and
I
return
upon
him
thus
:
"
why
,
Sir
,
it
be
a
valuable
thing
indeed
to
be
an
instrument
in
God
's
hand
to
convert
seven
-
and
-
thirty
heathen
to
the
knowledge
of
Christ
:
<EOS>
but
as
you
be
an
ecclesiastic
,
and
be
give
over
to
that
work
,
so
that
it
seem
naturally
to
fall
into
the
way
of
your
profession
,
how
be
it
then
that
you
do
not
rather
offer
yourself
to
undertake
it
,
than
press
me
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
he
face
about
,
just
before
me
,
as
he
walk
along
,
and
pull
me
to
a
full
stop
,
make
me
a
very
low
bow
:
<EOS>
"
I
most
heartily
thank
God
,
and
you
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
give
me
so
evident
a
call
to
so
bless
a
work
;
and
if
you
think
yourself
discharge
from
it
,
and
desire
me
to
undertake
it
,
I
will
most
readily
do
it
,
and
think
it
a
happy
reward
for
all
of
the
hazard
and
difficulty
of
such
a
broken
disappointed
voyage
as
I
have
meet
with
,
that
I
have
drop
at
last
into
so
glorious
a
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
discover
a
kind
of
rapture
in
his
face
while
he
speak
this
to
me
;
his
eye
sparkle
like
fire
,
his
face
bow
,
and
his
colour
come
and
go
as
if
he
have
be
fall
into
fit
;
in
a
word
,
he
be
tired
with
the
agony
of
be
embark
in
such
a
work
.
<EOS>
I
pause
a
considerable
while
before
I
could
tell
what
to
say
to
him
,
for
I
be
really
surprised
to
find
a
man
of
such
sincerity
and
zeal
,
and
carry
out
in
his
zeal
beyond
the
ordinary
rate
of
man
,
not
of
his
profession
only
,
but
even
of
any
profession
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
but
after
I
have
consider
it
awhile
,
I
ask
him
seriously
if
he
be
in
earnest
,
and
that
he
would
venture
on
the
single
consideration
of
an
attempt
on
those
poor
people
,
to
be
lock
up
in
an
unplanted
island
for
perhaps
his
life
,
and
at
last
may
not
know
whether
he
should
be
able
to
do
them
any
good
or
not
?
  
<EOS>
He
turn
short
upon
me
,
and
ask
me
what
I
call
a
venture
?
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
do
you
think
I
consent
to
go
in
your
ship
to
the
East
Indies
for
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
I
know
not
,
unless
it
be
to
preach
to
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
doubtless
it
be
,
"
say

and
do
you
think
if
I
can
convert
these
seven
-
and
-
thirty
man
to
the
faith
of
Christ

it
be
not
worth
my
time

though

off

<EOS>
Nay
,
be
it
not
infinitely
of
more
worth
to
save
so
many
soul
than
my
life
be
,
or
the
life

twenty
more
of

<EOS>
yes
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
would
give
Christ
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
thank
all
my

if
I
could

make
the

happy
instrument

poor

though
I
be
never

set
my
foot
off
this
island

or
see
my
native
country
any
more

<EOS>
but
since
you
will
honour
me
,
"
say
he
,
"
with
put
me
into
this
work
,
(
for
which
I
will
pray
for
you
all
the
day
of
my
life
)
<EOS>
I
have
one
humble
petition
to
you
,
"
say
he
"
besides
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
,
that
you
will
leave
your
man
Friday
with
me
,
to
be
my
interpreter
to
them
,
and
to
assist
me
for
without
some
help
I
can
not
speak
to
them
,
or
they
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
sensibly
troubled
at
his
request
Friday
,
because
I
could
not
think
of
part
with
him
,
and
that
for
many
reason
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
the
companion
of
my
travel
;
he
be
not
only
faithful
to
me
,
but
sincerely
affectionate
to
the
last
degree
;
and
I
have
resolve
to
do
something
considerable
for
him
if
he
out
-
live
me
,
as
it
be
probable
he
would
.
<EOS>
then
I
know
that
as
I
have
breed
Friday
up
to
be
a
Protestant
,
it
would
quite
confound
him
to
bring
him
to
embrace
another
profession
;
and
he
would
never
,
while
his
eye
be
open
,
believe
that
his
old
master
be
a
heretic
,
and
would
be
damn
;
and
this
may
in
the
end
ruin
the
poor
fellow
's
principle
,
and
so
turn
him
back
again
to
his
first
idolatry
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
a
sudden
thought
relieve
me
in
this
strait
,
and
it
be
this
<EOS>
:
I
tell
him
I
could
not
say
that
I
be
willing
to
part
with
Friday
on
any
account
<EOS>
whatever
;
though
a
work
that
to
him
be
of
more
value
than
his
life
,
ought
to
me
to
be
of
much
more
value
than
the
keeping
or
part
with
a
servant
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
other
hand
,
I
be
persuade
,
that
Friday
would
by
no
means
consent
to
part
with
me
;
and
then
to
force
him
to
it
without
his
consent
would
be
manifest
injustice
,
because
I
have
promise
I
would
never
put
him
away
,
and
he
have
promise
and
engage
to
me
that
he
would
never
leave
me
unless
I
put
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
very
much
concerned
at
it
;
for
he
have
no
rational
access
to
these
poor
people
,
see
he
do
not
understand
one
word
of
their
language
,
nor
they
one
word
of
his
.
<EOS>
to
remove
this
difficulty
,
I
tell
him
Friday
's
father
have
learn
Spanish
,
which
I
find
he
also
understand
,
and
he
should
serve
him
for
an
interpreter
;
so
he
be
much
better
satisfied
,
and
nothing
could
persuade
him
<EOS>
but
he
would
stay
to
endeavour
to
convert
them
;
but
Providence
give
another
and
very
happy
turn
to
all
this
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
back
now
to
the
first
part
of
his
objection
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
Englishmen
I
send
for
them
all
together
;
and
after
some
account
give
them
of
what
I
have
do
for
them
,
viz
.
<EOS>
what
necessary
thing
I
have
provide
for
them
,
and
how
they
be
distribute
,
which
they
be
sensible
of
,
and
very
thankful
for
;
I
begin
to
talk
to
them
of
the
scandalous
life
they
lead
,
and
give
them
a
full
account
of
the
notice
the
clergyman
have
already
take
of
it
;
and
argue
how
unchristian
and
irreligious
a
life
it
be
,
I
first
ask
them
if
they
be
marry
man
or
bachelor
?
<EOS>
They
soon
explain
their
condition
to
me
,
and
shew
me
that
two
of
them
be
widower
,
and
the
other
three
be
single
man
or
bachelor
.
<EOS>
I
ask
them
with
what
conscience
they
could
take
these
woman
,
and
lie
with
them
as
they
have
do
,
call
them
their
wife
,
and
have
so
many
child
by
them
,
and
not
be
marry
lawfully
to
them
?
  
<EOS>
They
all
give
me
the
answer
that
I
expect
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
nobody
to
marry
them
;
that
they
agree
before
the
governor
to
keep
them
as
their
wife
;
and
to
keep
them
and
own
them
as
their
wife
;
and
they
think
,
as
thing
stand
with
them
,
they
be
as
legally
married
as
if
they
have
be
marry
by
a
parson
,
and
with
all
the
formality
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
them
that
no
doubt
they
be
marry
in
the
sight
of
God
,
and
be
bind
in
conscience
to
keep
them
as
their
wife
;
but
that
the
law
of
man
be
otherwise
,
they
may
pretend
they
be
not
married
,
and
so
desert
the
poor
woman
and
child
hereafter
;
and
that
their
wife
,
be
poor
,
desolate
woman
,
friendless
and
moneyless
,
would
have
no
way
to
help
themselves
<EOS>
:
I
therefore
tell
them
,
that
unless
I
be
assure
of
their
honest
intent
,
I
could
do
nothing
for
them
;
but
would
take
care
that
what
I
do
should
be
for
the
woman
and
child
without
them
;
and
that
unless
they
would
give
some
assurance
that
they
would
marry
the
woman
,
I
could
not
think
it
be
convenient
they
should
continue
together
as
man
and
wife
;
for
that
it
be
both
scandalous
to
man
and
offensive
to
God
,
who
they
could
not
think
would
bless
them
if
they
go
on
thus
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
pass
as
I
expect
;
and
they
tell
me
,
especially
Will
Atkins
,
who
seem
now
to
speak
for
the
rest
,
that
they
love
their
wife
as
well
as
if
they
have
be
bear
in
their
own
native
country
,
and
would
not
leave
them
upon
any
account
whatever
;
and
they
do
verily
believe
their
wife
be
as
virtuous
and
as
modest
,
and
do
to
the
utmost
of
their
skill
as
much
for
them
and
for
their
child
as
any
woman
could
possibly
do
,
and
they
would
not
part
with
them
on
any
account
:
and
Will
Atkins
for
his
own
particular
add
,
if
any
man
would
take
him
away
,
and
offer
to
carry
him
home
to
England
,
and
to
make
him
captain
of
the
good
man
of
war
in
the
navy
,
he
would
not
go
with
him
if
he
may
not
carry
his
wife
and
child
with
him
;
and
if
there
be
a
clergyman
in
the
ship
,
he
would
be
married
to
her
now
with
all
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
just
as
I
would
have
it
.
<EOS>
the
priest
be
not
with
me
at
that
moment
,
but
be
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
so
to
try
him
farther
,
I
tell
him
I
have
a
clergyman
with
me
,
and
if
he
be
sincere
<EOS>
I
would
have
him
marry
the
next
morning
,
and
bade
him
consider
of
it
,
and
talk
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
as
for
himself
,
he
nee
not
consider
of
it
at
all
,
for
he
be
very
ready
to
do
it
,
and
be
glad
I
have
a
minister
with
me
;
and
he
believe
they
would
be
all
willing
also
.
<EOS>
I
then
tell
him
that
my
friend
the
minister
be
a
Frenchman
,
and
could
not
speak
English
,
but
that
I
would
act
the
clerk
between
them
.
<EOS>
He
never
so
much
as
ask
me
whether
he
be
a
Papist
or
Protestant
,
which
be
indeed
what
I
be
afraid
of
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
they
never
inquire
about
it
.
<EOS>
so
we
part
;
I
go
back
to
my
clergyman
,
and
Will
Atkins
go
in
to
talk
with
his
companion
.
<EOS>
I
desire
the
french
gentleman
not
to
say
any
thing
to
them
till
the
business
be
thorough
ripe
,
and
I
tell
him
what
answer
the
man
have
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
go
from
their
quarter
they
all
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
,
they
have
be
consider
what
I
have
say
;
that
they
be
very
glad
to
hear
I
have
a
clergyman
in
my
company
;
and
they
be
very
willing
to
give
me
the
satisfaction
I
desire
,
and
to
be
formally
marry
as
soon
as
I
please
;
for
they
be
far
from
desire
to
part
from
their
wife
;
and
that
they
mean
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
very
honest
when
they
choose
them
.
<EOS>
so
I
appoint
them
to
meet
me
the
next
morning
,
and
that
in
the
mean
time
they
should
let
their
wife
know
the
meaning
of
the
marriage
law
;
and
that
it
be
not
only
to
prevent
any
scandal
,
but
also
to
oblige
them
that
they
should
not
forsake
them
,
whatever
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
be
easily
make
sensible
of
the
meaning
of
the
thing
,
and
be
very
well
satisfied
with
it
,
as
indeed
they
have
reason
to
be
;
so
they
fail
not
to
attend
all
together
at
my
apartment
next
morning
,
where
I
bring
out
my
clergyman
:
and
though
he
have
not
on
a
minister
's
gown
,
after
the
manner
of
England
,
or
the
habit
of
a
priest
,
after
the
manner
of
France
;
yet
have
a
black
vest
,
something
like
a
cassock
,
with
a
sash
round
it
,
he
do
not
look
very
unlike
a
minister
;
and
as
for
his
language
<EOS>
I
be
interpreter
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
seriousness
of
his
behaviour
to
them
,
and
the
scruple
he
make
of
marry
the
woman
because
they
be
not
baptize
,
and
profess
Christians
,
give
them
an
exceed
reverence
for
his
person
;
and
there
be
no
need
after
that
to
inquire
whether
he
be
a
clergyman
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
afraid
his
scruple
would
have
be
carry
so
far
as
that
he
would
not
have
marry
them
at
all
:
<EOS>
nay
,
notwithstanding
all
I
be
able
to
say
to
him
,
he
resist
me
,
though
modestly
,
yet
very
steadily
;
and
at
last
refuse
absolutely
to
marry
them
,
unless
he
have
first
talk
with
the
man
and
the
woman
too
;
and
though
at
first
I
be
a
little
backward
to
it
,
yet
at
last
I
agree
to
it
with
a
good
will
,
perceive
the
sincerity
of
his
design
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
them
,
he
let
them
know
that
I
have
acquaint
him
with
their
circumstance
,
and
with
the
present
design
;
that
he
be
very
willing
to
perform
that
part
of
his
function
,
and
marry
them
as
I
have
desire
;
but
that
before
he
could
do
it
,
he
must
take
the
liberty
to
talk
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
that
in
the
sight
of
all
different
man
,
and
in
the
sense
of
the
law
of
society
,
they
have
live
all
this
while
in
an
open
adultery
;
and
that
it
be
true
that
nothing
but
the
consenting
to
marry
,
or
effectually
separate
them
from
one
another
now
,
could
put
an
end
to
it
;
but
there
be
a
difficulty
in
it
too
,
with
respect
to
the
law
of
christian
matrimony
,
which
he
be
not
fully
satisfied
about
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
of
marry
one
that
be
a
profess
Christian
to
a
savage
,
an
idolater
,
and
a
heathen
,
one
that
be
not
baptize
;
and
yet
that
he
do
not
see
that
there
be
time
leave
for
it
to
endeavour
to
persuade
the
woman
to
be
baptize
,
or
to
profess
the
name
of
Christ
,
whom
they
have
,
he
doubt
,
hear
nothing
of
,
and
without
which
they
could
not
be
baptize
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
doubt
they
be
but
indifferent
Christians
themselves
;
that
they
have
but
little
knowledge
of
God
or
his
way
,
and
therefore
he
could
not
expect
that
they
have
say
much
to
their
wife
on
that
head
yet
;
but
that
unless
they
would
promise
him
to
use
their
endeavour
with
their
wife
to
persuade
them
to
become
Christians
,
and
would
as
well
as
they
could
instruct
them
in
the
knowledge
and
belief
of
God
that
make
them
,
and
to
worship
Jesus
Christ
that
redeem
them
,
he
could
not
marry
them
;
for
he
would
have
no
hand
in
join
Christians
with
savage
;
nor
be
it
consistent
with
the
principle
of
the
christian
religion
,
and
be
indeed
expressly
forbid
in
God
's
law
.
  
<EOS>
They
hear
all
this
very
attentively
,
and
I
deliver
it
very
faithfully
to
them
from
his
mouth
,
as
near
his
own
word
as
I
could
,
only
sometimes
add
something
of
my
own
,
to
convince
them
how
just
it
be
,
and
how
I
be
of
his
mind
:
and
I
always
very
faithfully
distinguish
between
what
I
say
from
myself
and
what
be
the
clergyman
's
word
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
it
be
very
true
what
the
gentleman
have
say
,
that
they
be
but
very
indifferent
Christians
themselves
,
and
that
they
have
never
talk
to
their
wife
about
religion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Sir
,
"
say
Will
Atkins
,
"
how
should
we
teach
them
religion
?
<EOS>
why
,
we
know
nothing
ourselves
;
and
besides
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
should
we
go
to
talk
to
them
of
God
,
and
Jesus
Christ
,
and
heaven
and
hell
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
to
make
them
laugh
at
us
,
and
ask
us
what
we
believe
ourselves
?
<EOS>
and
if
we
should
tell
them
we
believe
all
the
thing
that
we
speak
of
to
them
,
such
as
of
good
people
go
to
heaven
,
and
wicked
people
to
the
devil
,
they
would
ask
us
,
where
we
intend
to
go
ourselves
who
believe
all
this
,
and
yet
be
such
wicked
fellow
,
as
we
indeed
be
:
why
,
Sir
,
"
say
Will
,
"
'
tis
enough
to
give
them
a
surfeit
of
religion
,
at
that
hearing
:
<EOS>
folk
must
have
some
religion
themselves
before
they
pretend
to
teach
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
Atkins
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
though
I
be
afraid
what
you
say
have
too
much
truth
in
it
,
yet
can
you
not
tell
your
wife
that
she
be
in
the
wrong
;
that
there
be
a
God
,
and
a
religion
well
than
her
own
;
that
her
god
be
idol
;
that
they
can
neither
hear
nor
speak
;
that
there
be
a
great
being
that
make
all
thing
,
and
that
can
destroy
all
that
he
have
make
;
that
he
reward
the
good
,
and
punish
the
bad
;
that
we
be
to
be
judge
by
him
,
at
last
,
for
all
we
do
here
?
<EOS>
You
be
not
so
ignorant
but
even
nature
itself
will
teach
you
that
all
this
be
true
;
and
I
be
satisfied
you
know
it
all
to
be
true
,
and
believe
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
Sir
,
"
say
Atkins
;
"
but
with
what
face
can
I
say
any
thing
to
my
wife
of
all
this
,
when
she
will
tell
me
immediately
it
can
not
be
true
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
true
!
"
say
I
;
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
she
will
tell
me
it
can
not
be
true
:
that
this
God
(
I
shall
tell
her
of
)
can
be
just
,
or
can
punish
or
reward
,
since
I
be
not
punish
and
send
to
the
devil
,
that
have
be
such
a
wicked
creature
as
she
know
I
have
be
,
even
to
her
,
and
to
every
body
else
;
and
that
I
should
be
suffer
to
live
,
that
have
be
always
act
so
contrary
to
what
I
must
tell
her
be
good
,
and
to
what
I
ought
to
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
truly
,
Atkins
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
thou
speakest
too
much
truth
;
"
and
with
that
I
let
the
clergyman
know
what
Atkins
have
say
,
for
he
be
impatient
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
priest
,
"
tell
him
there
be
one
thing
will
make
him
the
good
minister
in
the
world
to
his
wife
,
and
that
be
repentance
;
for
none
teach
repentance
like
true
penitent
.
<EOS>
He
want
nothing
but
to
repent
,
and
then
he
will
be
so
much
the
better
qualified
to
instruct
his
wife
;
he
will
then
be
able
to
tell
her
,
that
there
be
not
only
a
God
,
and
that
he
be
the
just
rewarder
of
good
and
evil
;
but
that
he
be
a
merciful
being
,
and
,
with
infinite
goodness
and
long
-
suffer
,
forbear
to
punish
those
that
offend
;
wait
to
be
gracious
,
and
willing
not
the
death
of
a
sinner
,
but
rather
that
he
should
return
and
live
;
that
he
often
suffer
wicked
man
to
go
on
a
long
time
,
and
even
reserve
damnation
to
the
general
day
of
retribution
:
that
it
be
a
clear
evidence
of
God
,
and
of
a
future
state
,
that
righteous
man
receive
not
their
reward
,
or
wicked
man
their
punishment
,
till
they
come
into
another
world
;
and
this
will
lend
him
to
teach
his
wife
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
,
and
of
the
last
judgment
:
let
him
but
repent
for
himself
,
he
will
be
an
excellent
preacher
of
repentance
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
repeat
all
this
to
Atkins
,
who
look
very
serious
all
the
while
,
and
who
,
we
could
easily
perceive
,
be
more
than
ordinarily
affected
with
it
:
when
be
eager
,
and
hardly
suffer
me
to
make
an
end
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
this
,
master
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
a
great
deal
more
;
but
I
han't
the
impudence
to
talk
thus
to
my
wife
,
when
God
and
my
own
conscience
know
,
and
my
wife
will
be
an
undeniable
evidence
against
me
,
that
I
have
live
as
if
I
never
hear
of
God
,
or
a
future
state
,
or
any
thing
about
it
;
and
to
talk
of
my
repenting
,
alas
!
<EOS>
(
and
with
that
he
fetch
a
deep
sigh
;
and
I
could
see
that
tear
stand
in
his
eye
,
)
'
<EOS>
tis
past
all
that
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
past
it
,
Atkins
!
"
say
I
;
"
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
well
enough
<EOS>
what
I
mean
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
mean
'
tis
too
late
;
and
that
be
too
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
my
clergyman
word
for
word
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
the
poor
zealous
priest
(
I
must
call
him
so
;
for
,
be
his
opinion
<EOS>
what
it
will
,
he
have
certainly
a
most
singular
affection
for
the
good
of
other
man
's
soul
;
and
it
would
be
hard
to
think
he
have
not
the
like
for
his
own
)
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
this
zealous
,
affectionate
man
could
not
refrain
tear
also
:
but
recover
himself
,
he
say
to
me
,
"
ask
him
but
one
question
:
be
he
easy
that
it
be
too
late
,
or
be
he
trouble
,
and
wish
it
be
not
so
?
<EOS>
"
I
put
the
question
fairly
to
Atkins
;
and
he
answer
with
a
great
deal
of
passion
,
"
how
could
any
man
be
easy
in
a
condition
that
certainly
must
end
in
eternal
destruction
?
<EOS>
that
he
be
far
from
be
easy
;
but
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
believe
it
would
one
time
or
the
other
ruin
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
he
say
,
"
he
believe
he
should
,
one
time
or
another
,
cut
his
own
throat
to
put
an
end
to
the
terror
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
clergyman
shake
his
head
,
with
a
great
concern
in
his
face
,
when
I
tell
him
all
this
;
but
turn
quick
to
me
upon
it
,
say
,
"
if
that
be
his
case
,
you
may
assure
him
it
be
not
too
late
;
Christ
will
give
him
repentance
.
<EOS>
but
pray
,
"
say
he
,
"
explain
this
to
him
,
that
as
no
man
be
save
but
by
Christ
,
and
the
merit
of
his
passion
,
procure
divine
mercy
for
him
,
how
can
it
be
too
late
for
any
man
to
receive
mercy
?
<EOS>
do
he
think
he
be
able
to
sin
beyond
the
power
or
reach
of
divine
mercy
?
<EOS>
pray
tell
him
,
there
may
be
a
time
when
provoke
mercy
will
no
longer
strive
,
and
when
God
may
refuse
to
hear
;
but
that
'
tis
never
too
late
for
man
to
ask
mercy
;
and
we
that
be
Christ
's
servant
be
command
to
preach
mercy
at
all
time
,
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
,
to
all
those
that
sincerely
repent
:
so
that
'
tis
never
too
late
to
repent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
Atkins
all
this
,
and
he
hear
me
with
great
earnestness
;
but
it
seem
as
if
he
turn
off
the
discourse
to
the
rest
;
for
he
say
to
me
he
would
go
and
have
some
talk
with
his
wife
:
<EOS>
so
he
go
out
awhile
,
and
we
talk
to
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
they
be
all
stupidly
ignorant
as
to
matter
of
religion
;
much
as
I
be
when
I
go
ramble
away
from
my
father
;
and
yet
that
there
be
none
of
them
backward
to
hear
what
have
be
say
;
and
all
of
them
seriously
promise
that
they
would
talk
with
their
wife
about
it
,
and
do
their
endeavour
to
persuade
them
to
turn
Christians
.
  
<EOS>
the
clergyman
smile
upon
me
when
I
report
what
answer
they
give
,
but
say
nothing
a
good
while
;
but
at
last
shake
his
head
,
"
We
that
be
Christ
's
servant
,
"
say
he
,
"
can
go
no
farther
than
to
exhort
and
instruct
;
and
when
man
comply
,
submit
to
the
reproof
,
and
promise
what
we
ask
,
'
tis
all
we
can
do
;
we
be
bind
to
accept
their
good
word
;
but
believe
me
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
whatever
you
may
have
know
of
the
life
of
that
man
you
call
William
Atkins
<EOS>
,
I
believe
he
be
the
only
sincere
convert
among
them
;
I
take
that
man
to
be
a
true
penitent
;
I
will
not
despair
of
the
rest
;
but
that
man
be
perfectly
strike
with
the
sense
of
his
past
life
;
and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
to
talk
of
religion
to
his
wife
,
he
will
talk
himself
effectually
into
it
;
for
attempt
to
teach
other
be
sometimes
the
good
way
of
teach
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
man
,
"
add
he
,
"
who
have
nothing
but
a
summary
notion
of
religion
himself
,
and
be
wicked
and
profligate
to
the
last
degree
in
his
life
,
make
a
thorough
reformation
in
himself
by
labour
to
convert
a
Jew
:
and
if
that
poor
Atkins
begin
but
once
to
talk
seriously
of
Jesus
Christ
to
his
wife
,
my
life
for
it
<EOS>
he
talk
himself
into
a
thorough
convert
,
make
himself
a
penitent
;
and
who
know
what
may
follow
?
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
discourse
,
however
,
and
their
promising
as
above
to
endeavour
to
persuade
their
wife
to
embrace
Christianity
,
he
marry
the
other
three
couple
;
but
Will
Atkins
and
his
wife
be
not
yet
come
in
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
my
clergyman
wait
awhile
,
be
curious
to
know
where
Atkins
be
go
;
and
turn
to
me
,
say
he
,
"
I
entreat
you
,
Sir
<EOS>
,
let
us
walk
out
of
your
labyrinth
here
and
look
;
I
dare
say
we
shall
find
this
poor
man
somewhere
or
other
,
talk
seriously
with
his
wife
,
and
teach
her
already
something
of
religion
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
of
the
same
mind
;
so
we
go
out
together
,
and
I
carry
him
a
way
which
none
know
but
myself
,
and
where
the
tree
be
so
thick
set
,
as
that
it
be
not
easy
to
see
through
the
thicket
of
leave
,
and
far
harder
to
see
in
than
to
see
out
;
when
come
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
I
see
Atkins
,
and
his
tawny
savage
wife
,
sit
under
the
shade
of
a
bush
,
very
eager
in
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
stop
short
till
my
clergyman
come
up
to
me
,
and
then
have
shew
him
where
they
be
,
we
stand
and
look
very
steadily
at
them
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
We
observe
him
very
earnest
with
her
,
point
up
to
the
sun
,
and
to
every
quarter
of
the
heavens
;
then
down
to
the
earth
,
then
out
to
the
sea
,
then
to
himself
,
then
to
her
,
to
the
wood
,
to
the
tree
.
"
now
,
"
say
my
clergyman
,
"
you
see
my
word
be
make
good
;
the
man
preach
to
her
;
mark
him
;
now
he
be
tell
her
that
our
God
have
make
him
,
and
her
,
and
the
heavens
,
the
earth
,
the
sea
,
the
wood
,
the
tree
,
&
c.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
be
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
immediately
we
perceive
Will
Atkins
start
up
upon
his
foot
,
fall
down
upon
his
knee
,
and
lift
up
both
his
hand
;
we
suppose
he
say
something
,
but
we
could
not
hear
him
;
it
be
too
far
off
for
that
:
he
do
not
continue
kneel
half
a
minute
,
but
come
and
sit
down
again
by
his
wife
,
and
talk
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
We
perceive
then
the
woman
very
attentive
,
but
whether
she
say
any
thing
or
no
we
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
while
the
poor
fellow
be
upon
his
knee
,
I
could
see
the
tear
run
plentifully
down
my
clergyman
's
cheek
;
and
I
could
hardly
forbear
myself
;
but
it
be
a
great
affliction
to
us
both
,
that
we
be
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
thing
that
pass
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
however
,
we
could
come
no
nearer
for
fear
of
disturb
them
;
so
we
resolve
to
see
an
end
of
this
piece
of
still
conversation
,
and
it
speak
loud
enough
to
us
without
the
help
of
voice
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
again
,
as
I
have
say
,
close
by
her
,
and
talk
again
earnestly
to
her
,
and
two
or
three
time
we
could
see
him
embrace
her
passionately
;
another
time
we
see
him
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
wipe
her
eye
,
and
then
kiss
her
again
,
with
a
kind
of
transport
very
unusual
;
and
after
several
of
these
thing
,
we
see
him
on
a
sudden
jump
up
again
and
lend
her
his
hand
to
help
her
up
,
when
immediately
lead
her
by
the
hand
a
step
or
two
,
they
both
kneel
down
together
,
and
continue
so
about
two
minute
.
  
<EOS>
My
friend
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
but
cry
out
aloud
,
"
St.
Paul
,
St.
Paul
,
behold
he
prayeth
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
Atkins
would
hear
him
;
therefore
I
entreat
him
to
withhold
himself
awhile
,
that
we
may
see
an
end
of
the
scene
,
which
to
me
,
I
must
confess
,
be
the
most
affecting
,
and
yet
the
most
agreeable
,
that
ever
I
see
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
strove
with
himself
,
and
contain
himself
for
awhile
,
but
be
in
such
rapture
of
joy
to
think
that
the
poor
heathen
woman
be
become
a
Christian
,
that
he
be
not
able
to
contain
himself
;
he
weep
several
time
:
then
throw
up
his
hand
,
and
cross
his
breast
,
say
over
several
thing
ejaculatory
,
and
by
way
of
give
God
thank
for
so
miraculous
<EOS>
a
testimony
of
the
success
of
our
endeavour
:
some
he
speak
softly
,
and
I
could
not
well
hear
<EOS>
;
other
audibly
;
some
in
Latin
,
some
in
French
;
then
two
or
three
time
the
tear
of
joy
would
interrupt
him
,
that
he
could
not
speak
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
I
beg
that
he
would
compose
himself
,
and
let
us
more
narrowly
and
fully
observe
what
be
before
us
,
which
he
do
for
a
time
,
and
the
scene
be
not
end
there
yet
;
for
after
the
poor
man
and
his
wife
be
rise
again
from
their
knee
,
we
observe
he
stand
talk
still
eagerly
to
her
;
and
we
observe
by
her
motion
that
she
be
greatly
affected
with
what
he
say
,
by
her
frequent
lift
up
her
hand
,
lay
her
hand
to
her
breast
,
and
such
other
posture
as
usually
express
the
great
seriousness
and
attention
.
<EOS>
this
continue
about
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
then
they
walk
away
too
;
so
that
we
could
see
no
more
of
them
in
that
situation
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
this
interval
to
talk
with
my
clergyman
:
and
first
I
tell
him
,
I
be
glad
to
see
the
particular
we
have
both
be
witness
to
;
that
though
I
be
hard
enough
of
belief
in
such
case
,
yet
that
I
begin
to
think
it
be
all
very
sincere
here
,
both
in
the
man
and
his
wife
,
however
ignorant
they
both
may
be
;
and
I
hope
such
a
beginning
would
have
yet
a
more
happy
end
:
"
and
who
know
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
these
two
may
in
time
,
by
instruction
and
example
,
work
upon
some
of
the
other
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
some
of
them
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
turn
quick
upon
me
,
"
ay
,
upon
all
of
them
:
depend
upon
it
,
if
those
two
savage
(
for
he
have
be
but
little
better
as
you
relate
it
)
<EOS>
should
embrace
Jesus
Christ
,
they
will
never
leave
till
they
work
upon
all
the
rest
;
for
true
religion
be
naturally
communicative
,
and
he
that
be
once
make
a
Christian
will
never
leave
a
Pagan
behind
him
if
be
can
help
it
,
<EOS>
"
I
own
it
be
a
most
christian
principle
to
think
so
,
and
a
testimony
of
a
true
zeal
,
as
well
as
a
generous
heart
in
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
my
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
will
you
give
me
liberty
to
start
one
difficulty
here
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
how
to
object
the
least
thing
against
that
affectionate
concern
which
you
shew
for
the
turning
the
poor
people
from
their
Paganism
to
the
christian
religion
;
but
how
do
this
comfort
you
,
while
these
people
be
,
in
your
account
,
out
of
the
pale
of
the
catholic
church
,
without
which
,
you
believe
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
salvation
;
so
that
you
esteem
these
but
heretic
still
;
and
,
for
other
reason
,
as
effectually
lose
as
the
Pagans
themselves
?
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
he
answer
with
abundance
of
candour
and
christian
charity
,
thus
:
"
Sir
,
I
be
a
Catholic
of
the
roman
church
,
and
a
priest
of
the
order
of
St.
Benedict
,
and
I
embrace
all
the
principle
of
the
roman
faith
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
if
you
will
believe
me
,
and
this
I
do
not
speak
in
compliment
to
you
,
or
in
respect
to
my
circumstance
and
your
civility
;
I
say
,
nevertheless
,
I
do
not
look
upon
you
,
who
call
yourselves
reform
,
without
some
charity
:
I
dare
not
say
,
though
I
know
it
be
our
opinion
in
general
,
yet
I
dare
not
say
,
that
you
can
not
be
save
;
I
will
by
no
means
limit
the
mercy
of
Christ
,
so
far
as
to
think
that
he
can
not
receive
you
into
the
bosom
of
his
church
,
in
a
manner
to
us
imperceivable
,
and
which
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
know
;
and
I
hope
you
have
the
same
charity
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
pray
daily
for
your
be
all
restore
to
Christ
's
church
,
by
whatsoever
method
<EOS>
he
,
who
be
all
-
wise
,
be
pleased
to
direct
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
sure
you
will
allow
it
to
consist
with
me
,
as
a
Roman
,
to
distinguish
far
between
a
Protestant
and
a
Pagan
;
between
him
that
call
on
Jesus
Christ
,
though
in
a
way
which
I
do
not
think
be
accord
to
the
true
faith
;
and
a
savage
,
a
barbarian
,
that
know
no
God
,
no
Christ
,
no
Redeemer
at
all
;
and
if
you
be
not
within
the
pale
of
the
catholic
church
,
we
hope
you
be
nearer
be
restore
to
it
than
those
that
know
nothing
at
all
of
God
or
his
church
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
,
therefore
,
when
I
see
this
poor
man
,
who
,
you
say
,
have
be
a
profligate
,
and
almost
a
murderer
,
kneel
down
and
pray
to
Jesus
Christ
,
as
we
suppose
he
do
,
though
not
fully
enlighten
;
believe
that
God
,
from
whom
every
such
work
proceed
,
will
sensibly
touch
his
heart
,
and
bring
him
to
the
further
knowledge
of
the
truth
in
his
own
time
;
and
if
God
shall
influence
this
poor
man
to
convert
and
instruct
the
ignorant
savage
<EOS>
his
wife
,
I
can
never
believe
that
he
shall
be
cast
away
himself
;
and
have
I
not
reason
then
to
rejoice
,
the
nearer
any
be
bring
to
the
knowledge
of
Christ
,
though
they
may
not
be
bring
quite
home
into
the
bosom
of
the
catholic
church
,
just
at
the
time
when
I
may
desire
it
;
leave
it
to
the
goodness
of
Christ
to
perfect
his
work
in
his
own
time
,
and
his
own
way
?
<EOS>
certainly
I
would
rejoice
if
all
the
savage
in
America
be
bring
,
like
this
poor
woman
,
to
pray
to
God
,
though
they
be
to
be
all
Protestants
at
first
,
rather
than
they
should
continue
pagan
and
heathen
;
firmly
believe
,
that
He
who
have
bestow
that
first
light
upon
them
,
would
farther
illuminate
them
with
a
beam
of
his
heavenly
grace
,
and
bring
them
into
the
pale
of
his
church
,
when
he
should
see
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
at
the
sincerity
and
temper
of
this
truly
pious
Papist
,
as
much
as
I
be
oppress
by
the
power
of
his
reasoning
;
and
it
presently
occur
to
my
thought
,
that
if
such
a
temper
be
universal
,
we
may
be
all
Catholic
Christians
,
whatever
church
or
particular
profession
we
be
join
to
,
or
join
in
;
that
a
spirit
of
charity
would
soon
work
us
all
up
into
right
principle
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
as
he
think
that
the
like
charity
would
make
us
all
Catholics
,
as
I
tell
him
<EOS>
,
I
believe
have
all
the
member
of
his
church
the
like
moderation
they
would
soon
be
all
Protestants
;
and
there
we
leave
that
part
,
for
we
never
dispute
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
talk
to
him
another
way
;
and
take
him
by
the
hand
,
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
wish
all
the
clergy
of
the
roman
church
be
bless
with
such
moderation
,
and
an
equal
share
of
your
charity
.
<EOS>
I
be
entirely
of
your
opinion
;
but
I
must
tell
you
,
that
if
you
should
preach
such
doctrine
in
Spain
or
Italy
,
they
would
put
you
into
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
know
not
what
they
may
do
in
Spain
and
Italy
;
but
I
will
not
say
they
would
be
the
well
Christians
for
that
severity
;
for
I
be
sure
there
be
no
heresy
in
too
much
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
well
,
as
Will
Atkins
and
his
wife
be
go
,
our
business
there
be
over
;
so
we
go
back
our
own
way
;
and
when
we
come
back
we
find
them
wait
to
be
call
in
.
<EOS>
observe
this
,
I
ask
my
clergyman
if
we
should
discover
to
him
that
we
have
see
him
under
the
bush
,
or
no
;
and
it
be
his
opinion
we
should
not
;
but
that
we
should
talk
-
to
him
first
,
and
hear
what
he
would
say
to
us
:
<EOS>
so
we
call
him
in
alone
<EOS>
,
nobody
be
in
the
place
but
ourselves
;
and
I
begin
with
him
thus
:
  
"
Will
Atkins
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
pr'ythee
what
education
have
you
?
<EOS>
what
be
your
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
W.A.
a
well
man
than
ever
<EOS>
I
shall
be
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
my
father
be
a
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
<EOS>
what
education
do
he
give
you
?
  
<EOS>
W.A.
He
would
have
teach
me
well
,
Sir
;
but
I
despise
all
education
,
instruction
,
or
correction
,
like
a
beast
as
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
Solomon
say
,
"
He
that
despiseth
reproof
be
brutish
.
"
  
<EOS>
W.A.
ay
,
Sir
,
I
be
brutish
indeed
;
I
murder
my
father
;
for
God
's
sake
,
Sir
,
talk
no
more
about
that
,
Sir
;
I
murder
my
poor
father
.
  
<EOS>
priest
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
a
murderer
?
       
<EOS>
[
here
the
priest
start
(
for
I
interpret
every
word
as
he
     
speak
it
)
,
and
look
pale
:
it
seem
he
believe
that
Will
     
have
really
kill
his
own
father
.
]
  
<EOS>
R.C.
no
,
no
,
Sir
,
I
do
not
understand
him
so
.
<EOS>
Will
Atkins
,
explain
yourself
:
you
do
not
kill
your
father
,
do
you
,
with
your
own
hand
?
  
<EOS>
W.A.
no
,
Sir
<EOS>
;
I
do
not
cut
his
throat
;
but
I
cut
the
thread
of
all
his
comfort
,
and
shorten
his
day
;
I
break
his
heart
by
the
most
ungrateful
,
unnatural
return
for
the
most
tender
,
affectionate
treatment
that
ever
father
give
,
or
child
could
receive
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
<EOS>
well
,
I
do
not
ask
you
about
your
father
to
extort
this
confession
;
I
pray
God
give
you
repentance
for
it
,
and
forgive
you
that
and
all
your
other
sin
;
but
I
ask
you
,
because
I
see
that
,
though
you
have
not
much
learn
,
yet
you
be
not
so
ignorant
as
some
be
in
thing
that
be
good
;
that
you
have
know
more
of
religion
a
great
deal
than
you
have
practise
.
  
<EOS>
W.A.
<EOS>
though
you
,
Sir
,
do
not
extort
the
confession
that
I
make
about
my
father
,
conscience
do
;
and
whenever
we
come
to
look
back
upon
our
life
,
the
sin
against
our
indulgent
parent
be
certainly
the
first
that
touch
us
;
the
wound
they
make
lie
deepest
;
and
the
weight
they
leave
will
lie
heavy
upon
the
mind
of
all
the
sin
we
can
commit
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
You
talk
too
feelingly
and
sensible
for
me
,
Atkins
;
I
can
not
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
W.A.
<EOS>
You
bear
it
,
master
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
know
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
<EOS>
yes
,
Atkins
,
every
shore
,
every
hill
,
nay
,
I
may
say
every
tree
in
this
island
,
be
witness
to
the
anguish
of
my
soul
for
my
ingratitude
and
base
usage
of
a
good
tender
father
;
a
father
much
like
your
by
your
description
;
and
I
murder
my
father
as
well
as
you
,
Will
Atkins
;
but
think
for
all
that
,
my
repentance
be
short
of
yours
too
,
by
a
great
deal
.
       
<EOS>
[
I
would
have
say
more
,
if
I
could
have
restrain
my
     
passion
;
but
I
think
this
poor
man
's
repentance
be
so
     
much
sincere
than
mine
,
that
I
be
go
to
leave
off
the
     
discourse
and
retire
,
for
I
be
surprised
with
what
he
say
,
     
and
think
,
that
,
instead
of
my
go
about
to
teach
<EOS>
and
     
instruct
him
,
the
man
be
make
a
teacher
and
instructor
to
     
me
,
in
a
most
surprising
and
unexpected
manner
.
]
  
<EOS>
I
lay
all
this
before
the
young
clergyman
,
who
be
greatly
affected
with
it
,
and
say
to
me
,
"
do
I
not
say
,
Sir
,
that
when
this
man
be
convert
he
would
preach
to
us
all
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Sir
,
if
this
one
man
be
make
a
true
penitent
,
here
will
be
no
need
of
me
,
he
will
make
Christians
of
all
in
the
island
.
"
<EOS>
but
have
a
little
compose
myself
I
renew
my
discourse
with
Will
Atkins
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Will
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
how
come
the
sense
of
this
matter
to
touch
you
just
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
W.A.
Sir
,
you
have
set
me
about
a
work
that
have
strike
a
dart
through
my
very
soul
;
I
have
be
talk
about
God
and
religion
to
my
wife
,
in
order
,
as
you
direct
me
,
to
make
a
Christian
of
her
;
and
she
have
preach
such
a
sermon
to
me
as
I
shall
never
forget
while
I
live
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
no
,
no
;
it
be
not
your
wife
have
preach
to
you
;
but
when
you
be
move
religious
argument
to
her
,
conscience
have
fling
them
back
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
W.A.
ay
,
Sir
,
with
such
a
force
as
be
not
to
be
resist
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
Pray
,
Will
,
let
us
know
what
pass
between
you
and
your
wife
;
for
I
know
something
of
it
already
.
  
<EOS>
W.A.
Sir
,
it
be
impossible
to
give
you
a
full
account
of
it
:
I
be
too
full
to
hold
it
,
and
yet
have
no
tongue
to
express
it
:
but
let
her
have
say
what
she
will
,
and
though
I
can
not
give
you
an
account
of
it
,
this
I
can
tell
you
of
it
,
that
I
resolve
to
amend
and
reform
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
but
tell
us
some
of
it
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
begin
Will
?
<EOS>
for
this
have
be
an
extraordinary
case
,
that
be
certain
;
she
have
preach
a
sermon
indeed
,
if
she
have
work
this
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
W.A.
<EOS>
why
,
I
first
tell
her
the
nature
of
our
law
about
marriage
,
and
what
the
reason
be
that
man
and
woman
be
oblige
to
enter
into
such
compact
as
it
be
neither
in
the
power
of
one
or
other
to
break
;
that
otherwise
,
order
and
justice
could
not
be
maintain
,
and
man
would
run
from
their
wife
and
abandon
their
child
,
mix
confusedly
with
one
another
,
and
neither
family
be
keep
entire
,
or
inheritance
be
settle
by
a
legal
descent
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
You
talk
like
a
civilian
,
Will
.
<EOS>
Could
you
make
her
understand
what
you
mean
by
inheritance
and
family
?
<EOS>
They
know
no
such
thing
among
the
savage
,
but
marry
any
how
,
without
any
regard
to
relation
,
consanguinity
,
or
family
;
brother
and
sister
,
nay
,
as
I
have
be
tell
,
even
the
father
and
daughter
,
and
the
son
and
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
W.A.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Sir
,
you
be
misinform
;
 
my
wife
assure
me
of
the
contrary
,
and
that
they
abhor
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
for
any
further
relation
they
may
not
be
so
exact
as
we
be
;
but
she
tell
me
they
never
touch
one
another
in
the
near
relation
you
speak
of
.
  
<EOS>
R.C.
<EOS>
well
,
what
do
she
say
to
what

make
him
dead
,
as
she
call
it
,
and
then
she
should
be
leave
alone
,
and
never
be
teach
to
know
this
God
better
;
and
lest
he
should
be
miserable
,
as
he
tell
her
wicked
man
should
be
after
death
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
strange
account
,
and
very
affecting
to
us
both
,
but
particularly
the
young
clergyman
;
he
be
indeed
wonderfully
surprised
with
it
;
but
under
the
great
affliction
imaginable
that
he
could
not
talk
to
her
;
that
he
could
not
speak
English
to
make
her
understand
him
;
and
as
she
speak
but
<EOS>
very
broken
English
<EOS>
he
could
not
understand
her
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
turn
himself
to
me
,
and
tell
me
,
that
he
believe
there
must
be
more
to
do
with
this
woman
than
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
him
at
first
,
but
at
length
he
explain
himself
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
she
ought
to
be
baptize
.
  
<EOS>
I
agree
with
him
in
that
part
readily
,
and
be
for
go
about
it
presently
:
"
no
,
no
;
hold
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
;
"
<EOS>
though
I
would
have
her
baptize
by
all
mean
,
yet
I
must
observe
,
that
Will
Atkins
,
her
husband
,
have
indeed
bring
her
,
in
a
wonderful
manner
,
to
be
willing
to
embrace
a
religious
life
;
and
have
give
her
just
idea
of
the
being
of
a
God
,
of
his
power
,
justice
,
and
mercy
;
yet
<EOS>
I
desire
to
know
of
him
,
if
he
have
say
any
thing
to
her
of
Jesus
Christ
,
and
of
the
salvation
of
sinner
;
of
the
nature
of
faith
in
him
,
and
the
redemption
by
him
;
of
the
Holy
Spirit
,
the
Resurrection
,
the
last
judgment
,
and
a
future
state
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
call
Will
Atkins
again
,
and
ask
him
;
but
the
poor
fellow
fall
immediately
into
tear
,
and
tell
us
he
have
say
something
to
her
of
all
those
thing
,
but
that
he
be
himself
so
wicked
a
creature
,
and
his
own
conscience
so
reproach
him
with
his
horrid
,
ungodly
life
,
that
he
tremble
at
the
apprehension
,
that
her
knowledge
of
him
should
lessen
the
attention
she
should
give
to
those
thing
,
and
make
her
rather
contemn
religion
than
receive
it
:
but
he
be
assure
,
he
say
,
that
her
mind
be
so
disposed
to
receive
due
impression
of
all
those
thing
,
that
,
if
I
would
but
discourse
with
her
,
she
would
make
it
appear
to
my
satisfaction
that
my
labour
would
not
be
lose
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
call
her
in
,
and
place
myself
as
interpreter
between
my
religious
priest
and
the
woman
,
I
entreat
him
to
begin
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
sure
such
a
sermon
be
never
preach
by
a
popish
priest
in
these
latter
age
of
the
world
:
and
,
as
I
tell
him
,
I
think
he
have
all
the
zeal
,
all
the
knowledge
,
all
the
sincerity
of
a
Christian
,
without
the
error
of
a
roman
Catholic
;
and
that
I
take
him
to
be
such
a
clergyman
as
the
roman
bishop
be
before
the
church
of
Rome
<EOS>
assume
spiritual
sovereignty
over
the
conscience
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
bring
the
poor
woman
to
embrace
the
knowledge
of
Christ
,
and
of
redemption
by
him
,
not
with
wonder
and
astonishment
only
,
as
she
do
the
first
notion
of
a
God
,
but
with
joy
and
faith
,
with
an
affection
,
and
a
surprising
degree
of
understanding
,
scarce
to
be
imagine
,
much
less
to
be
express
;
and
at
her
own
request
she
be
baptize
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
prepare
to
baptize
her
,
I
entreat
him
that
he
would
perform
that
office
with
some
caution
,
that
the
man
may
not
perceive
he
be
of
the
roman
church
,
if
possible
;
because
of
other
ill
consequence
which
may
attend
a
difference
among
us
in
that
very
religion
which
we
be
instruct
the
other
in
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
as
he
have
no
consecrate
chapel
,
nor
proper
thing
for
the
office
,
I
should
see
he
would
do
it
in
a
manner
that
I
should
not
know
by
it
that
he
be
a
roman
Catholic
himself
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
I
have
not
know
it
before
,
and
so
he
do
;
<EOS>
for
say
only
some
word
over
to
himself
in
Latin
,
which
I
could
not
understand
,
he
pour
a
whole
dishfull
of
water
upon
the
woman
's
head
,
pronounce
in
French
very
loud
Mary
(
which
be
the
name
her
husband
desire
me
to
give
her
,
for
I
be
her
godfather
,
)
<EOS>
I
baptize
thee
in
the
name
of
the
Father
,
and
of
the
Son
,
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
so
that
none
could
know
any
thing
by
it
<EOS>
what
religion
he
be
of
<EOS>
:
he
give
the
benediction
afterwards
in
Latin
;
but
either
Will
Atkins
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
French
,
or
else
do
not
take
notice
of
it
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
this
be
over
,
he
marry
them
;
and
after
the
marriage
be
over
,
he
turn
himself
to
Will
Atkins
,
and
in
a
very
affectionate
manner
exhort
him
not
only
to
persevere
in
that
good
disposition
<EOS>
he
be
in
,
but
to
support
the
conviction
that
be
upon
him
by
a
resolution
to
reform
his
life
;
tell
him
it
be
in
vain
to
say
he
repent
if
he
do
not
forsake
his
crime
;
represent
to
him
,
how
God
have
honour
him
with
be
the
instrument
of
bring
his
wife
to
the
knowledge
of
the
christian
religion
;
and
that
he
should
be
careful
he
do
not
dishonour
the
grace
of
God
;
and
that
if
he
do
,
he
would
see
the
heathen
a
well
Christian
than
himself
;
the
savage
convert
,
and
the
instrument
cast
away
!
  
<EOS>
He
say
a
great
many
good
thing
to
them
both
,
and
then
recommend
them
,
in
a
few
word
,
to
God
's
goodness
;
give
them
the
benediction
again
,
I
repeat
every
thing
to
them
in
English
:
and
thus
end
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
the
most
pleasant
,
agreeable
day
to
me
that
ever
I
pass
in
my
whole
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
clergyman
have
not
do
yet
;
his
thought
hang
continually
upon
the
conversion
of
the
thirty
-
seven
savage
,
and
fain
he
would
have
staid
upon
the
island
to
have
undertake
it
;
but
I
convince
him
,
first
,
that
his
undertaking
be
impracticable
in
itself
;
and
secondly
,
that
,
perhaps
,
I
could
put
it
into
a
way
of
be
do
,
in
his
absence
,
to
his
satisfaction
;
of
which
by
and
by
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
bring
the
affair
of
the
island
to
a
narrow
compass
,
I
be
prepare
to
go
on
board
the
ship
when
the
young
man
,
whom
I
have
take
out
of
the
famished
ship
's
company
,
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
,
he
understand
I
have
a
clergyman
with
me
,
and
that
I
have
cause
the
Englishmen
to
be
married
to
the
savage
whom
they
call
wife
;
that
he
have
a
match
too
,
which
he
desire
may
be
finish
before
I
go
,
between
two
Christians
,
which
he
hope
would
not
be
disagreeable
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
this
must
be
the
young
woman
who
be
his
mother
's
servant
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
other
christian
woman
on
the
island
.
<EOS>
so
I
begin
to
persuade
him
not
to
do
any
thing
of
that
kind
rashly
,
or
because
he
find
himself
in
this
solitary
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
represent
that
he
have
some
considerable
substance
in
the
world
,
and
good
friend
,
as
I
understand
by
himself
,
and
by
his
maid
also
;
that
the
maid
be
not
only
poor
,
and
a
servant
,
but
be
unequal
to
him
,
she
be
twenty
-
six
or
twenty
-
seven
year
old
,
and
he
not
above
seventeen
or
eighteen
;
that
he
may
very
probably
,
with
my
assistance
,
make
a
remove
from
this
wilderness
,
and
come
into
his
own
country
again
,
and
that
then
it
would
be
a
thousand
to
one
<EOS>
but
he
would
repent
his
choice
,
and
the
dislike
of
that
circumstance
may
be
disadvantageous
to
both
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
more
,
but
he
interrupt
me
,
smile
;
and
tell
me
,
with
a
great
deal
of
modesty
,
that
I
mistake
in
my
guess
;
that
he
have
nothing
of
that
kind
in
his
thought
,
his
present
circumstance
be
melancholy
and
disconsolate
enough
;
and
he
be
very
glad
to
hear
that
I
have
some
thought
of
put
them
in
a
way
to
see
their
own
country
again
;
and
that
nothing
should
have
set
him
upon
stay
there
,
but
that
the
voyage
I
be
go
be
so
exceed
long
and
hazardous
,
and
would
carry
him
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
all
his
friend
;
that
he
have
nothing
to
desire
of
me
,
but
that
I
would
settle
him
in
some
little
property
of
the
island
where
he
be
;
give
him
a
servant
or
two
,
and
some
few
necessary
,
and
he
would
settle
himself
here
like
a
planter
,
wait
the
good
time
when
,
if
ever
I
return
to
England
,
I
would
redeem
him
,
and
hope
I
would
not
be
unmindful
of
him
when
I
come
to
England
;
that
he
would
give
me
some
letter
to
his
friend
in
London
,
to
let
them
know
how
good
I
have
be
to
him
,
and
what
part
of
the
world
,
and
what
circumstance
I
have
leave
him
in
;
and
he
promise
me
,
that
whenever
I
redeem
him
,
the
plantation
,
and
all
the
improvement
he
have
make
upon
it
,
let
the
value
be
what
it
would
,
should
be
wholly
mine
.
  
<EOS>
His
discourse
be
very
prettily
deliver
,
consider
his
youth
,
and
be
the
more
agreeable
to
me
,
because
he
tell
me
positively
the
match
be
not
for
himself
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
all
possible
assurance
,
that
,
if
I
live
to
come
safe
to
England
,
I
would
deliver
his
letter
,
and
do
his
business
effectually
,
and
that
he
may
depend
I
would
never
forget
the
circumstance
I
leave
him
in
.
<EOS>
but
still
I
be
impatient
to
know
who
be
the
person
to
be
marry
;
upon
which
he
tell
me
it
be
my
Jack
of
all
Trades
and
his
maid
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
most
agreeably
surprised
when
he
name
the
match
;
for
indeed
I
have
think
it
very
suitable
.
<EOS>
the
character
of
that
man
I
have
give
already
;
and
as
for
the
maid
,
she
be
a
very
honest
,
modest
,
sober
,
and
religious
young
woman
;
have
a
very
good
share
of
sense
;
be
agreeable
enough
in
her
person
;
speak
very
handsomely
,
and
to
the
purpose
;
always
with
decency
and
good
manner
,
and
not
backward
to
speak
when
any
thing
require
it
,
or
impertinently
forward
to
speak
when
it
be
not
her
business
;
very
handy
and
housewifely
in
any
thing
that
be
before
her
;
an
excellent
manager
,
and
fit
indeed
to
have
be
governess
to
the
whole
island
;
she
know
very
well
how
to
behave
herself
to
all
kind
of
folk
she
have
about
her
,
and
to
better
if
she
have
find
any
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
match
be
propose
in
this
manner
<EOS>
,
we
marry
them
the
same
day
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
be
father
at
the
altar
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
give
her
away
,
so
I
give
her
a
portion
,
for
I
appoint
her
and
her
husband
a
handsome
large
space
of
ground
for
their
plantation
;
and
indeed
this
match
,
and
the
proposal
the
young
gentleman
make
to
me
,
to
give
him
a
small
property
in
the
island
,
put
me
upon
parcel
it
out
among
them
,
that
they
may
not
quarrel
afterwards
about
their
situation
.
  
<EOS>
this
sharing
out
the
land
to
them
<EOS>
I
leave
to
Will
Atkins
,
who
indeed
be
now
grow
a
most
sober
,
grave
,
manage
fellow
,
<EOS>
perfectly
reform
,
exceed
pious
and
religious
,
and
as
far
as
I
may
be
allow
to
speak
positively
in
such
a
case
,
I
verily
believe
be
a
true
sincere
penitent
.
  
<EOS>
He
divide
thing
so
justly
,
and
so
much
to
every
one
's
satisfaction
,
that
they
only
desire
one
general
write
under
my
hand
for
the
whole
,
which
I
cause
to
be
draw
up
,
and
sign
and
seal
to
them
,
set
out
the
bound
and
situation
of
every
man
's
plantation
,
and
testify
that
I
give
them
thereby
,
severally
,
a
right
to
the
whole
possession
and
inheritance
of
the
respective
plantation
or
farm
,
with
their
improvement
,
to
them
and
their
heir
;
reserve
all
the
rest
of
the
island
as
my
own
property
,
and
a
certain
rent
for
every
particular
plantation
after
eleven
year
,
if
I
or
any
one
from
me
,
or
in
my
name
,
come
to
demand
it
,
produce
an
attest
copy
of
the
same
writing
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
government
and
law
among
them
,
I
tell
them
,
I
be
not
capable
of
give
them
well
rule
than
they
be
able
to
give
themselves
;
only
make
them
promise
me
to
live
in
love
and
good
neighbourhood
with
one
another
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
prepare
to
leave
them
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
I
must
not
omit
,
and
that
is
,
that
be
now
settle
in
a
kind
of
commonwealth
among
themselves
,
and
have
much
business
in
hand
,
it
be
but
odd
to
have
<EOS>
seven
-
and
-
thirty
Indians
live
in
a
nook
of
the
island
,
independent
,
and
indeed
unemployed
;
for
except
the
provide
themselves
food
,
which
they
have
difficulty
enough
in
do
sometimes
,
they
have
no
manner
of
business
or
property
to
manage
:
I
propose
therefore
to
the
governor
Spaniard
,
that
he
should
go
to
them
with
Friday
's
father
,
and
propose
to
them
to
remove
,
and
either
plant
for
themselves
,
or
take
them
into
their
several
family
as
servant
,
to
be
maintain
for
their
labour
,
but
without
be
absolute
slave
,
for
I
would
not
admit
them
to
make
them
slave
by
force
by
any
mean
,
because
they
have
their
liberty
give
by
capitulation
,
and
as
it
be
article
of
surrender
,
which
they
ought
not
to
break
.
  
<EOS>
They
most
willingly
embrace
the
proposal
,
and
come
all
very
cheerfully
along
with
him
;
so
we
allot
them
land
and
plantation
,
which
three
or
four
accept
of
,
but
all
the
rest
choose
to
be
employ
as
servant
in
the
several
family
we
have
settle
;
and
thus
my
colony
be
in
a
manner
settle
as
follow
:
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
possess
my
original
habitation
,
which
be
the
capital
city
,
and
extend
their
plantation
all
along
the
side
of
the
brook
which
make
the
creek
that
I
have
so
often
describe
,
as
far
as
my
bower
;
and
as
they
increase
their
culture
,
it
go
always
eastward
.
<EOS>
the
English
live
in
the
north
-
east
part
,
where
Will
Atkins
and
his
comrade
begin
,
and
come
on
southward
and
south
-
west
,
towards
the
back
part
of
the
Spaniards
;
and
every
plantation
have
a
great
addition
of
land
to
take
in
,
if
they
find
occasion
,
so
that
they
need
not
jostle
one
another
for
want
of
room
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
west
end
of
the
island
be
leave
uninhabite
,
that
,
if
any
of
the
savage
should
come
on
shore
there
,
only
for
their
usual
customary
barbarity
,
they
may
come
and
go
;
if
they
disturb
nobody
,
nobody
would
disturb
them
;
and
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
they
be
often
ashore
,
and
go
away
again
,
for
I
never
hear
that
the
planter
be
ever
attack
and
disturb
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
come
into
my
thought
that
I
have
hint
to
my
friend
the
clergyman
that
the
work
of
convert
the
savage
may
perhaps
be
set
on
foot
in
his
absence
to
his
satisfaction
;
and
I
tell
him
,
that
now
I
think
it
be
put
in
a
fair
way
,
for
the
savage
be
thus
divide
among
the
Christians
,
if
they
would
but
every
one
of
them
do
their
part
with
those
which
come
under
their
hand
,
I
hope
it
may
have
a
very
good
effect
.
  
<EOS>
He
agree
presently
in
that
;
"
if
,
"
say
he
,
"
they
will
do
their
part
;
but
how
,
"
say
he
,
"
shall
we
obtain
that
of
them
?
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
we
would
call
them
all
together
,
and
leave
it
in
charge
with
them
,
or
go
to
them
one
by
one
,
which
he
think
best
;
<EOS>
so
we
divide
it
 
<EOS>
he
to
speak
to
the
Spaniards
,
who
be
all
Papists
,
and
I
to
the
English
,
who
be
all
Protestants
;
and
we
recommend
it
earnestly
to
them
,
and
make
them
promise
that
they
would
never
make
any
distinction
of
papist
or
Protestant
in
their
exhort
the
savage
to
turn
Christians
,
but
teach
them
the
general
knowledge
of
the
true
God
,
and
of
their
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
;
and
they
likewise
promise
us
that
they
would
never
have
any
difference
or
dispute
one
with
another
about
religion
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
Will
Atkins
's
house
,
(
I
may
call
it
so
,
for
such
a
house
,
or
such
a
piece
of
basket
-
work
,
I
believe
be
not
stand
in
the
world
again
!
)
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
I
come
thither
<EOS>
I
find
the
young
woman
I
have
mention
above
,
and
<EOS>
William
Atkins
's
wife
,
be
become
intimate
;
and
this
prudent
and
religious
young
woman
have
perfect
the
work
Will
Atkins
have
begin
;
and
though
it
be
not
above
four
day
after
what
I
have
relate
,
yet
the
new
-
baptize
savage
woman
be
make
such
a
Christian
as
I
have
seldom
hear
of
any
like
her
,
in
all
my
observation
or
conversation
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
next
into
my
mind
in
the
morning
,
before
I
go
to
them
,
that
among
all
the
needful
thing
I
have
to
leave
with
them
,
I
have
not
leave
a
Bible
;
<EOS>
in
which
I
shew
myself
less
consider
for
them
than
my
good
friend
the
widow
be
for
me
,
when
she
send
me
the
cargo
of
100l
.
<EOS>
from
Lisbon
,
where
she
pack
up
three
Bibles
and
a
prayer
-
book
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
good
woman
's
charity
have
a
great
extent
than
ever
she
imagine
,
for
they
be
reserve
for
the
comfort
and
instruction
of
those
that
make
much
well
use
of
them
than
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
one
of
the
Bibles
in
my
pocket
;
and
when
I
come
to
William
Atkins
's
tent
,
or
house
,
I
find
the
young
woman
and
Atkins
's
baptize
wife
have
be
discourse
of
religion
together
<EOS>
(
for
William
Atkins
tell
it
me
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
.
)
<EOS>
I
ask
if
they
be
together
now
?
<EOS>
and
he
say
yes
;
<EOS>
so
I
go
into
the
house
,
and
he
with
me
,
and
we
find
them
together
,
very
earnest
in
discourse
:
"
<EOS>
O
Sir
,
"
say
William
Atkins
,
"
when
God
have
sinner
to
reconcile
to
himself
,
and
alien
to
bring
home
,
he
never
want
a
messenger
:
my
wife
have
get
a
new
instructor
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
unworthy
,
as
I
be
incapable
of
that
work
 
that
young
woman
have
be
send
hither
from
Heaven
 
<EOS>
she
be
enough
to
convert
a
whole
island
of
savage
.
<EOS>
"
the
young
woman
blush
,
and
rise
up
to
go
away
,
but
I
desire
her
to
sit
still
;
I
tell
her
she
have
a
good
work
upon
her
hand
,
and
I
hope
God
would
bless
her
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
talk
a
little
,
and
I
do
not
perceive
they
have
any
book
among
them
,
though
I
do
not
ask
,
but
I
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
,
and
pull
out
my
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
"
say
I
to
Atkins
,
"
I
have
bring
you
an
assistant
,
that
perhaps
you
have
not
before
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
so
confound
,
that
he
be
not
able
to
speak
for
some
time
;
but
recover
himself
,
he
take
it
with
both
hand
,
and
turn
to
his
wife
,
"
<EOS>
here
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
I
tell
you
our
God
,
though
he
live
above
,
could
hear
what
we
say
?
<EOS>
here
be
the
book
I
pray
for
when
you
and
I
kneel
down
under
the
bush
;
now
God
have
hear
us
,
and
send
it
.
<EOS>
"
when
he
have
say
thus
,
the
man
fall
in
such
transport
of
a
passionate
joy
,
that
between
the
joy
of
have
it
,
and
give
God
thank
for
it
,
the
tear
run
down
his
face
like
a
child
that
be
cry
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
be
surprised
,
and
be
like
to
have
run
into
a
mistake
that
none
of
us
be
aware
of
;
for
she
firmly
believe
God
have
send
the
book
upon
her
husband
's
petition
:
it
be
true
that
providentially
it
be
so
,
and
may
be
take
so
in
a
consequent
sense
;
but
I
believe
it
would
have
be
no
difficult
matter
at
that
time
to
have
persuade
the
poor
woman
to
have
believe
that
an
express
messenger
come
from
Heaven
on
purpose
to
bring
that
individual
book
;
but
it
be
too
serious
a
matter
to
suffer
any
delusion
to
take
place
<EOS>
:
so
I
turn
to
the
young
woman
,
and
tell
her
we
do
not
desire
to
impose
upon
the
convert
in
her
first
and
more
ignorant
understanding
of
thing
,
and
beg
her
to
explain
to
her
that
God
may
be
very
properly
say
to
answer
our
petition
,
when
in
the
course
of
his
providence
such
thing
be
in
a
particular
manner
bring
to
pass
as
we
petition
for
;
but
we
do
not
expect
return
from
Heaven
in
a
miraculous
and
particular
manner
;
and
that
it
be
our
mercy
it
be
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
this
the
young
woman
do
afterwards
effectually
;
so
that
there
be
,
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
no
priestcraft
use
here
;
and
I
should
have
think
it
one
of
the
most
unjustifiable
fraud
in
the
world
to
have
have
it
so
:
but
the
surprise
of
joy
upon
Will
Atkins
be
really
not
to
be
express
;
and
there
we
may
be
sure
be
no
delusion
.
<EOS>
sure
no
man
be
ever
more
thankful
in
the
world
for
any
thing
of
its
kind
than
he
be
for
this
Bible
;
and
I
believe
never
any
man
be
glad
of
a
Bible
from
a
well
principle
;
and
though
he
have
be
a
most
profligate
creature
,
desperate
,
headstrong
,
outrageous
,
furious
,
and
wicked
to
a
great
degree
,
yet
this
man
be
a
stand
rule
to
us
all
for
the
well
instruct
child
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
parent
should
never
give
over
to
teach
and
instruct
,
or
ever
despair
of
the
success
of
their
endeavour
,
let
the
child
be
ever
so
obstinate
,
refractory
,
or
to
appearance
insensible
of
instruction
;
for
if
ever
God
in
his
providence
touch
the
conscience
of
such
,
the
force
of
their
education
return
upon
them
,
and
the
early
instruction
of
parent
be
not
lose
,
though
it
may
have
be
many
year
lay
asleep
,
but
some
time
or
other
they
may
find
the
benefit
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
be
with
this
poor
man
.
<EOS>
however
ignorant
he
be
,
or
divest
of
religion
and
christian
knowledge
<EOS>
,
he
find
he
have
some
to
do
with
now
more
ignorant
than
himself
;
and
that
the
least
part
of
the
instruction
of
his
good
father
that
could
now
come
to
his
mind
be
of
use
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
rest
it
occur
to
him
,
he
say
,
how
his
father
use
to
insist
much
upon
the
inexpressible
value
of
the
Bible
,
the
privilege
and
blessing
of
it
to
nation
,
family
,
and
person
;
but
he
never
entertain
the
least
notion
of
the
worth
of
it
till
now
,
when
be
to
talk
to
heathen
,
savage
,
and
barbarian
,
he
want
the
help
of
the
write
oracle
for
his
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
woman
be
very
glad
of
it
also
for
the
present
occasion
,
though
she
have
one
,
and
so
have
the
youth
,
on
board
our
ship
among
the
good
which
be
not
yet
bring
on
shore
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
say
so
many
thing
of
this
young
woman
,
I
can
not
omit
tell
one
story
more
of
her
and
myself
,
which
have
something
in
it
very
informing
and
remarkable
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
relate
to
what
extremity
the
poor
young
woman
be
reduce
;
how
her
mistress
be
starve
to
death
,
and
do
die
on
board
that
unhappy
ship
we
meet
at
sea
;
and
how
the
whole
ship
's
company
be
reduce
to
the
last
extremity
,
the
gentlewoman
and
her
son
,
and
this
maid
,
be
first
hardly
use
as
to
provision
,
and
at
last
totally
neglect
and
starve
;
that
be
to
say
,
bring
to
the
last
extremity
of
hunger
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
be
discourse
with
her
upon
the
extremity
they
suffer
,
I
ask
her
if
she
could
describe
by
what
she
feel
what
it
be
to
starve
,
and
how
it
appear
?
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
believe
she
could
,
and
she
tell
her
tale
very
distinctly
thus
:
  
"
First
,
Sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
we
have
for
some
day
fare
exceed
hard
,
and
suffer
very
great
hunger
,
but
now
at
last
we
be
wholly
without
food
of
any
kind
except
sugar
,
and
a
little
wine
,
and
a
little
water
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
after
I
have
receive
no
food
at
all
,
I
find
myself
,
towards
evening
,
first
empty
and
sickish
at
my
stomach
,
and
near
night
mightily
incline
to
yawning
,
and
sleepy
;
I
lie
down
on
a
couch
in
the
great
cabin
to
sleep
,
and
sleep
about
three
hour
,
and
awake
a
little
refreshed
,
have
take
a
glass
of
wine
when
I
lie
down
.
<EOS>
after
be
about
three
hour
awake
,
it
be
about
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
I
find
myself
empty
,
and
my
stomach
sickish
again
,
and
lie
down
again
,
but
could
not
sleep
at
all
,
be
very
faint
and
ill
;
and
thus
I
continue
all
the
second
day
with
a
strange
variety
 
first
hungry
,
then
sick
again
,
with
retching
to
vomit
.
<EOS>
the
second
night
,
be
oblige
to
go
to
bed
again
without
any
food
more
than
a
draught
of
fair
water
,
and
be
asleep
<EOS>
,
I
dream
I
be
at
Barbadoes
,
and
that
the
market
be
mightily
stock
with
provision
,
that
I
buy
some
for
my
mistress
,
and
go
and
dine
very
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
stomach
be
full
after
this
,
as
it
would
have
be
after
or
at
a
good
dinner
;
but
when
I
wake
,
I
be
exceedingly
sink
in
my
spirit
to
find
myself
in
the
extremity
of
famine
;
the
last
glass
of
wine
we
have
I
drink
,
and
put
sugar
into
it
,
because
of
its
have
some
spirit
to
supply
nourishment
;
but
there
be
no
substance
in
the
stomach
for
the
digest
office
to
work
upon
,
I
find
the
only
effect
of
the
wine
be
to
raise
disagreeable
fume
from
the
stomach
into
the
head
;
and
I
lie
,
as
they
tell
me
,
stupid
and
senseless
as
one
drunk
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
third
day
in
the
morning
,
after
a
night
of
strange
and
confused
inconsistent
dream
,
and
rather
doze
than
sleep
,
I
awake
ravenous
and
furious
with
hunger
;
and
I
question
,
have
not
my
understanding
return
and
conquer
it
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
I
question
whether
,
if
I
have
be
a
mother
,
and
have
have
a
little
child
with
me
,
its
life
would
have
be
safe
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
last
about
three
hour
,
during
which
time
I
be
twice
rage
mad
as
any
creature
in
Bedlam
,
as
my
young
master
tell
me
,
and
as
he
can
now
inform
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
one
of
these
fit
of
lunacy
or
distraction
,
whether
by
the
motion
of
the
ship
or
some
slip
of
my
foot
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
I
fall
down
,
and
strike
my
face
against
the
corner
of
a
pallet
-
bed
,
in
which
my
mistress
lie
,
and
with
the
blow
the
blood
gush
out
of
my
nose
,
and
the
cabin
-
boy
bring
me
a
little
basin
,
I
sit
down
and
bleed
into
it
a
great
deal
,
and
as
the
blood
run
from
me
I
come
to
myself
,
and
the
violence
of
the
flame
or
the
fever
I
be
in
abated
,
and
so
do
the
ravenous
part
of
the
hunger
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
grow
sick
,
and
retch
to
vomit
,
but
could
not
,
for
I
have
nothing
in
my
stomach
to
bring
up
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
bleed
some
time
I
swoon
,
and
they
all
believe
I
be
dead
;
but
I
come
to
myself
soon
after
,
and
then
have
a
most
dreadful
pain
in
my
stomach
,
not
to
be
describe
,
not
like
the
colic
,
but
a
gnaw
eager
pain
for
food
,
and
towards
night
it
go
off
with
a
kind
of
earnest
wishing
or
longing
for
food
,
something
like
,
as
I
suppose
,
the
longing
of
a
woman
with
child
.
<EOS>
I
take
another
draught
of
water
with
sugar
in
it
,
but
my
stomach
loathe
the
sugar
,
and
bring
it
all
up
again
;
then
I
take
a
draught
of
water
without
sugar
,
and
that
stay
with
me
,
and
I
lay
me
down
upon
the
bed
,
pray
most
heartily
that
it
would
please
God
to
take
me
away
;
and
compose
my
mind
in
hope
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
slumber
awhile
;
and
then
wake
,
think
myself
die
,
be
light
with
vapour
from
an
empty
stomach
:
<EOS>
I
recommend
my
soul
to
God
,
and
earnestly
wish
that
somebody
would
throw
me
into
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
while
my
mistress
lie
by
me
just
,
as
I
think
,
expire
,
but
bore
it
with
much
more
patience
than
I
,
and
give
the
last
bit
of
bread
she
have
to
her
child
,
my
young
master
,
who
would
not
have
take
it
,
but
she
oblige
him
to
eat
it
,
and
I
believe
it
save
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
towards
the
morning
I
sleep
again
,
and
first
when
I
awake
I
fall
into
a
violent
passion
of
crying
,
and
after
that
have
a
second
fit
of
violent
hunger
,
so
that
I
get
up
ravenous
,
and
<EOS>
in
a
most
dreadful
condition
.
<EOS>
have
my
mistress
be
dead
,
so
much
as
I
love
her
,
I
be
certain
I
should
have
eat
a
piece
of
her
flesh
with
as
much
relish
and
as
unconcerned
as
ever
<EOS>
I
do
the
flesh
of
any
creature
appoint
for
food
;
and
once
or
twice
I
be
go
to
bite
my
own
arm
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
see
the
basin
in
which
be
the
blood
have
bleed
at
my
nose
the
day
before
;
I
run
to
it
,
and
swallow
it
with
such
haste
,
and
such
a
greedy
appetite
,
as
if
I
have
wonder
nobody
have
take
it
before
,
and
afraid
it
should
be
take
from
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
though
after
it
be
down
the
thought
of
it
fill
me
with
horror
,
yet
it
check
the
fit
of
hunger
,
and
I
drink
a
draught
of
fair
water
,
and
be
compose
and
refresh
for
some
hour
,
after
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
fourth
day
;
and
thus
I
hold
it
till
towards
night
,
when
,
within
the
compass
of
three
hour
,
I
have
all
these
several
circumstance
over
again
,
one
after
another
,
viz
.
<EOS>
sick
,
sleepy
,
eagerly
hungry
,
pain
in
the
stomach
,
then
ravenous
again
,
then
sick
again
,
then
lunatic
,
then
cry
,
then
ravenous
again
,
and
so
every
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
my
strength
waste
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
at
night
I
lay
me
down
,
have
no
comfort
but
in
the
hope
that
I
should
die
before
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
night
I
have
no
sleep
,
but
the
hunger
be
now
turn
into
a
disease
,
and
I
have
a
terrible
colic
and
griping
,
wind
instead
of
food
have
find
its
way
into
my
bowel
;
and
in
this
condition
I
lie
till
morning
,
when
I
be
surprised
a
little
with
the
cry
and
lamentation
of
my
young
master
,
who
call
out
to
me
that
his
mother
be
dead
.
<EOS>
I
lift
myself
up
a
little
,
for
I
have
not
strength
to
rise
,
but
find
she
be
not
dead
,
though
she
be
able
to
give
very
little
sign
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
then
such
convulsion
in
my
stomach
for
want
of
some
sustenance
,
that
I
can
not
describe
them
,
with
such
frequent
throe
and
pang
of
appetite
that
nothing
but
the
torture
of
death
can
imitate
;
and
this
condition
I
be
in
when
I
hear
the
seaman
above
cry
out
"
a
sail
!
<EOS>
a
sail
!
"
<EOS>
and
halloo
and
jump
about
as
if
they
be
distract
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
able
to
get
off
from
the
bed
,
and
my
mistress
much
less
;
and
my
master
be
so
sick
that
I
think
he
have
be
expire
;
so
we
could
not
open
the
cabin
-
door
,
or
get
any
account
what
it
be
that
occasion
such
a
combustion
;
nor
have
we
any
conversation
with
the
ship
's
company
for
two
day
,
they
have
tell
us
they
have
not
a
mouthful
of
any
thing
to
eat
in
the
ship
;
and
they
tell
us
afterwards
they
think
we
have
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
this
dreadful
condition
we
be
in
when
you
be
send
to
save
our
life
;
and
how
you
find
us
,
Sir
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
,
and
better
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
her
own
relation
,
and
be
such
a
distinct
account
of
starve
to
death
as
I
confess
I
never
meet
with
,
and
be
exceed
entertaining
to
me
:
<EOS>
I
be
the
rather
apt
to
believe
it
to
be
a
true
account
,
because
the
youth
give
me
an
account
of
a
good
part
of
it
;
though
I
must
own
not
so
distinct
and
so
feelingly
as
his
maid
,
and
the
rather
because
it
seem
his
mother
feed
him
at
the
price
of
her
own
life
:
but
the
poor
maid
,
though
her
constitution
be
strong
than
that
of
her
mistress
,
who
be
in
year
,
and
a
weakly
woman
too
,
she
may
struggle
harder
with
it
;
I
say
,
the
poor
maid
may
be
suppose
to
feel
the
extremity
something
soon
than
her
mistress
,
who
may
be
allow
to
keep
the
last
bit
something
long
than
she
part
with
any
to
relieve
the
maid
.
<EOS>
no
question
,
as
the
case
be
here
relate
,
if
our
ship
,
or
some
other
,
have
not
so
providentially
meet
them
,
a
few
day
more
would
have
end
all
their
life
,
unless
they
have
prevent
it
by
eat
one
another
;
and
even
that
,
as
their
case
stand
,
would
have
serve
them
but
a
little
while
,
they
be
five
hundred
league
from
any
land
,
or
any
possibility
of
relief
,
other
than
in
the
miraculous
manner
it
happen
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
by
the
way
;
I
return
to
my
disposition
of
thing
among
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
and
first
,
it
be
to
be
observe
here
,
that
for
many
reason
I
do
not
think
fit
to
let
them
know
any
thing
of
the
sloop
I
have
frame
,
and
which
I
think
of
set
up
among
them
;
for
I
find
,
at
least
at
my
first
come
,
such
seed
of
division
among
them
,
that
I
see
it
plainly
,
have
I
set
up
the
sloop
,
and
leave
it
among
them
,
they
would
,
upon
very
light
disgust
,
have
separate
,
and
go
away
from
one
another
;
or
perhaps
have
turn
pirate
,
and
so
make
the
island
a
den
of
thief
,
instead
of
a
plantation
of
sober
and
religious
people
,
as
I
intend
it
to
be
;
nor
do
I
leave
the
two
piece
of
brass
cannon
that
I
have
on
board
,
or
the
two
quarter
-
deck
gun
,
that
my
nephew
take
extraordinary
,
for
the
same
reason
:
I
think
they
have
enough
to
qualify
them
for
a
defensive
war
,
against
any
that
should
invade
them
;
but
I
be
not
to
set
them
up
for
an
offensive
war
,
or
to
encourage
them
to
go
abroad
to
attack
other
,
which
,
in
the
end
,
would
only
bring
ruin
and
destruction
upon
themselves
and
all
their
undertaking
:
I
reserve
the
sloop
,
therefore
,
and
the
gun
,
for
their
service
another
way
,
as
I
shall
observe
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
do
with
the
island
:
I
leave
them
all
in
good
circumstance
,
and
in
a
flourish
condition
,
and
go
on
board
my
ship
again
the
fifth
day
of
May
,
have
be
five
and
twenty
day
among
them
;
and
,
as
they
be
all
resolve
to
stay
upon
the
island
till
I
come
to
remove
them
,
<EOS>
I
promise
to
send
some
further
relief
from
the
Brasils
,
if
I
could
possibly
find
an
opportunity
;
and
particularly
I
promise
to
send
them
some
cattle
;
such
as
sheep
,
hog
,
and
cow
;
for
as
to
the
two
cow
and
calf
which
I
bring
from
England
,
we
have
be
oblige
,
by
the
length
of
our
voyage
,
to
kill
them
at
sea
,
for
want
of
hay
to
feed
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
give
them
a
salute
of
five
gun
at
parting
,
we
set
sail
,
and
arrive
at
the
bay
of
all
Saints
,
in
the
Brasils
,
in
about
twenty
-
two
day
;
meet
nothing
remarkable
in
our
passage
but
this
,
that
about
three
day
after
we
sail
,
be
becalm
,
and
the
current
set
strong
to
the
n.n.e.
run
,
as
it
be
,
into
a
bay
or
gulf
on
the
land
side
,
we
be
drive
something
out
of
our
course
;
and
once
or
twice
our
man
cry
Land
,
to
the
westward
;
but
whether
it
be
the
continent
,
or
island
,
we
could
not
tell
by
any
mean
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
third
day
,
towards
evening
,
the
sea
smooth
and
the
weather
calm
<EOS>
,
we
see
the
sea
,
as
it
be
,
cover
towards
the
land
,
with
something
very
black
,
not
be
able
to
discover
what
it
be
;
but
,
after
some
time
,
our
chief
mate
go
up
the
main
shroud
a
little
way
,
and
look
at
them
with
a
perspective
,
cry
out
,
it
be
an
army
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
what
he
mean
by
an
army
,
and
speak
a
little
hastily
,
call
the
fellow
a
fool
,
or
some
such
word
:
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
be
angry
,
for
it
be
an
army
,
and
a
fleet
too
;
<EOS>
for
I
believe
there
be
a
thousand
canoe
,
and
you
may
see
them
paddle
along
,
and
they
be
come
towards
us
too
apace
,
and
full
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
surprised
then
,
indeed
,
and
so
be
my
nephew
the
captain
;
for
he
have
hear
such
terrible
story
of
them
in
the
island
,
and
have
never
be
in
those
sea
before
,
that
he
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
,
but
say
two
or
three
time
,
we
should
all
be
devour
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
consider
we
be
becalm
,
and
the
current
set
strong
towards
,
the
shore
,
I
like
it
the
bad
;
however
,
I
bid
him
not
be
afraid
,
but
bring
the
ship
to
an
anchor
,
as
soon
as
we
come
so
near
as
to
know
that
we
must
engage
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
weather
continue
calm
,
and
they
come
on
apace
towards
us
;
so
I
give
order
to
come
to
an
anchor
,
and
furl
all
our
sail
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
savage
,
I
tell
them
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
but
fire
;
and
therefore
they
should
get
their
boat
out
,
and
fasten
them
,
one
close
by
the
head
,
and
the
other
by
the
stern
,
and
man
them
both
well
,
and
wait
the
issue
in
that
posture
:
<EOS>
this
I
do
,
that
the
man
in
the
boat
may
be
ready
,
with
sheet
and
bucket
,
to
put
out
any
fire
these
savage
may
endeavour
to
fix
upon
the
outside
of
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
posture
we
lay
by
for
them
,
and
in
a
little
while
they
come
up
with
us
;
but
never
be
such
a
horrid
sight
see
by
Christians
;
my
mate
be
much
mistake
in
his
calculation
of
their
number
,
I
mean
of
a
thousand
canoe
;
the
most
we
could
make
of
them
when
they
come
up
,
be
about
126
;
and
a
great
many
of
them
too
;
for
some
of
them
have
sixteen
or
seventeen
man
in
them
,
some
more
,
and
the
least
six
or
seven
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
nearer
to
us
,
they
seem
to
be
strike
with
wonder
and
astonishment
,
as
at
a
sight
which
they
have
,
doubtless
,
never
see
before
;
nor
could
they
,
at
first
,
as
we
afterwards
understand
,
know
what
to
make
of
us
.
<EOS>
They
come
boldly
up
however
,
very
near
to
us
,
and
seem
to
go
about
to
row
round
us
;
but
we
call
to
our
man
in
the
boat
not
to
let
them
come
too
near
them
.
<EOS>
this
very
order
bring
us
to
an
engagement
with
them
,
without
our
design
it
;
for
five
or
six
of
the
large
canoe
come
so
near
our
long
-
boat
,
that
our
man
beckon
with
their
hand
to
keep
them
back
,
which
they
understand
very
well
,
and
go
back
:
but
at
their
retreat
about
fifty
arrow
come
on
board
us
from
those
boat
,
and
one
of
our
man
in
the
long
-
boat
be
very
much
wound
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
call
to
them
not
to
fire
by
any
mean
;
but
we
hand
down
some
deal
board
into
the
boat
,
and
the
carpenter
presently
set
up
a
kind
of
fence
,
like
waste
board
,
to
cover
them
from
the
arrow
of
the
savage
,
if
they
should
shoot
again
.
  
<EOS>
about
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
they
all
come
up
in
a
body
astern
of
us
,
and
so
near
that
we
could
easily
discern
what
they
be
,
though
we
could
not
tell
their
design
;
and
I
easily
find
they
be
some
of
my
old
friend
,
the
same
sort
of
savage
that
I
have
be
use
to
engage
with
.
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
more
they
row
a
little
farther
out
to
sea
,
till
they
come
directly
broadside
with
us
,
and
then
row
down
straight
upon
us
,
till
they
come
so
near
that
they
could
hear
us
speak
;
upon
this
,
I
order
all
my
man
to
keep
close
,
lest
they
should
shoot
any
more
arrow
,
and
make
all
our
gun
ready
;
but
be
so
near
as
to
be
within
hearing
,
I
make
Friday
go
out
upon
the
deck
,
and
call
out
aloud
to
them
in
his
language
,
to
know
what
they
mean
.
<EOS>
whether
they
understand
him
or
not
,
that
I
know
not
;
but
as
soon
as
he
have
call
to
them
,
six
of
them
,
who
be
in
the
foremost
or
near
boat
to
us
,
turn
their
canoe
from
us
,
and
stoop
down
,
show
us
their
naked
back
;
whether
this
be
a
defiance
or
challenge
we
know
not
,
or
whether
it
be
do
in
mere
contempt
,
or
as
a
signal
to
the
rest
;
but
immediately
Friday
cry
out
they
be
go
to
shoot
,
and
,
unhappily
for
him
,
poor
fellow
,
they
let
fly
about
three
hundred
of
their
arrow
,
and
to
my
inexpressible
grief
,
kill
poor
Friday
,
no
other
man
be
in
their
sight
.
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
be
shoot
with
no
less
than
three
arrow
,
and
about
three
more
fall
very
near
him
;
such
unlucky
marksman
they
be
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
annoyed
at
the
loss
of
my
old
trusty
servant
and
companion
,
that
I
immediately
order
five
gun
to
be
load
with
small
shot
,
and
four
with
great
,
and
give
them
such
a
broadside
as
they
have
never
hear
in
their
life
before
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
above
half
a
cable
's
length
off
when
we
fire
;
and
our
gunner
take
their
aim
so
well
,
that
three
or
four
of
their
canoe
be
overset
,
as
we
have
reason
to
believe
,
by
one
shot
only
.
<EOS>
the
ill
manner
of
turn
up
their
bare
back
to
us
give
us
no
great
offence
;
neither
do
I
know
for
certain
whether
that
which
would
pass
for
the
great
contempt
among
us
may
be
understand
so
by
them
or
not
;
therefore
,
in
return
,
I
have
only
resolve
to
have
fire
four
or
five
gun
at
them
with
powder
only
,
which
I
know
would
frighten
them
sufficiently
:
<EOS>
but
when
they
shoot
at
us
directly
with
all
the
fury
they
be
capable
of
,
and
especially
as
they
have
kill
my
poor
Friday
,
whom
I
so
entirely
love
and
value
,
and
who
,
indeed
,
so
well
deserve
it
,
I
think
myself
not
only
justifiable
before
God
and
man
,
but
would
have
be
very
glad
if
I
could
have
overset
every
canoe
there
,
and
drown
every
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
neither
tell
how
many
we
kill
nor
how
many
we
wound
at
this
broadside
,
but
sure
such
a
fright
and
hurry
never
be
see
among
such
a
multitude
;
there
be
thirteen
or
fourteen
of
their
canoe
split
and
overset
in
all
,
and
the
man
all
set
a
-
swimming
:
the
rest
,
frighten
out
of
their
wit
,
scour
away
as
fast
as
they
could
,
taking
but
little
care
to
save
those
whose
boat
be
split
or
spoil
with
our
shot
;
so
I
suppose
that
many
of
them
be
lose
;
and
our
man
take
up
one
poor
fellow
swimming
for
his
life
;
above
an
hour
after
they
be
all
go
.
  
<EOS>
Our
small
shot
from
our
cannon
must
needs
kill
and
wound
a
great
many
;
but
,
in
short
,
we
never
know
any
thing
how
it
go
with
them
;
for
they
flee
so
fast
that
,
in
three
hour
,
or
thereabout
,
we
could
not
see
above
three
or
four
straggle
canoe
;
nor
do
we
ever
see
the
rest
any
more
;
for
a
breeze
of
wind
spring
up
the
same
evening
,
we
weigh
and
set
sail
for
the
brasil
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
prisoner
indeed
,
but
the
creature
be
so
sullen
,
that
he
would
neither
eat
nor
speak
;
and
we
all
fancy
he
would
starve
himself
to
death
;
but
I
take
a
way
to
cure
him
;
for
I
make
them
take
him
,
and
turn
him
into
the
long
-
boat
,
and
make
him
believe
they
would
toss
him
into
the
sea
again
,
and
so
leave
him
where
they
find
him
,
if
he
would
not
speak
:
nor
would
that
do
,
but
they
really
do
throw
him
into
the
sea
,
and
come
away
from
him
;
and
then
he
follow
them
,
for
he
swam
like
a
cork
,
and
call
to
them
in
his
tongue
,
though
they
know
not
one
word
of
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
,
they
take
him
in
again
,
and
then
he
begin
to
be
more
tractable
;
nor
do
I
ever
design
they
should
drown
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
under
sail
again
;
but
I
be
the
most
disconsolate
creature
alive
,
for
want
of
my
man
Friday
,
and
would
have
be
very
glad
to
have
go
back
to
the
island
,
to
have
take
one
of
the
rest
from
thence
for
my
occasion
,
but
it
could
not
be
;
so
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
We
have
one
prisoner
,
as
I
have
say
;
and
it
be
a
long
while
before
we
could
make
him
understand
any
thing
;
but
in
time
,
our
man
teach
him
some
English
,
and
he
begin
to
be
a
little
tractable
:
afterwards
we
inquire
what
country
he
come
from
,
but
could
make
nothing
of
what
he
say
;
for
his
speech
be
so
odd
,
all
guttural
,
and
speak
in
the
throat
,
in
such
a
hollow
and
odd
manner
,
that
we
could
never
form
a
word
from
him
;
and
we
be
all
of
opinion
that
they
may
speak
that
language
as
well
if
they
be
gag
,
as
otherwise
;
nor
could
we
perceive
that
they
have
any
occasion
either
for
tooth
,
tongue
,
lip
,
or
palate
;
but
form
their
word
just
as
a
hunting
-
horn
form
a
tune
,
with
an
open
throat
:
he
tell
us
,
however
,
some
time
after
,
when
we
have
teach
him
to
speak
a
little
English
,
that
they
be
go
,
with
their
king
,
to
fight
a
great
battle
.
<EOS>
when
he
say
king
,
we
ask
him
,
<EOS>
how
many
king
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
there
be
five
nation
<EOS>
(
we
could
not
make
him
understand
the
plural
s
,
)
and
that
they
all
join
to
go
against
two
nation
.
<EOS>
We
ask
him
,
what
make
them
come
up
to
us
?
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
to
makee
te
great
wonder
look
.
"
 
<EOS>
where
it
be
to
be
observe
,
that
all
those
native
,
as
also
those
of
Africa
,
when
they
learn
English
,
they
always
add
two
e
's
at
the
end
of
the
word
where
we
use
one
,
and
place
the
accent
upon
the
last
of
them
;
as
makee
,
takee
,
and
the
like
;
and
we
could
not
break
them
of
it
;
nay
<EOS>
,
I
could
hardly
make
Friday
leave
it
off
,
though
at
last
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
name
the
poor
fellow
once
more
<EOS>
,
I
must
take
my
last
leave
of
him
;
poor
honest
Friday
!
<EOS>
We
bury
him
with
all
decency
and
solemnity
possible
,
by
put
him
into
a
coffin
,
and
throw
him
into
the
sea
;
and
I
cause
them
to
fire
eleven
gun
for
him
:
and
so
end
the
life
of
the
most
grateful
,
faithful
,
honest
,
and
most
affectionate
servant
that
ever
man
have
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
go
away
with
a
fair
wind
for
Brasil
,
and
,
in
about
twelve
day
time
,
we
make
land
in
the
latitude
of
five
degree
south
of
the
line
,
be
the
north
-
easternmost
land
of
all
that
part
of
America
.
<EOS>
We
keep
on
S.
by
E.
in
sight
of
the
shore
four
day
,
when
we
make
the
Cape
St.
Augustine
,
and
in
three
day
come
to
an
anchor
off
the
bay
of
All
Saints
,
the
old
place
of
my
deliverance
,
from
whence
come
both
my
good
and
evil
fate
.
  
<EOS>
never
do
a
ship
come
to
this
part
that
have
less
business
than
I
have
;
and
yet
it
be
with
great
difficulty
that
we
be
admit
to
hold
the
least
correspondence
on
shore
.
<EOS>
not
my
partner
himself
,
who
be
alive
,
and
make
a
great
figure
among
them
,
not
my
two
merchant
trustee
,
nor
the
fame
of
my
wonderful
preservation
in
the
island
,
could
obtain
me
that
favour
;
but
my
partner
remember
that
I
have
give
five
hundred
moidore
to
the
prior
of
the
monastery
of
the
Augustines
,
and
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
to
the
poor
,
go
to
the
monastery
,
and
oblige
the
prior
that
then
be
,
to
go
to
the
governor
,
and
beg
leave
for
me
presently
,
with
the
captain
,
and
one
more
,
besides
eight
seaman
,
to
come
on
shore
,
and
no
more
;
and
this
upon
condition
absolutely
capitulate
for
,
that
we
should
not
offer
to
land
any
good
out
of
the
ship
,
or
to
carry
any
person
away
without
licence
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
so
strict
with
us
,
as
to
land
any
good
,
that
it
be
with
extreme
difficulty
that
I
get
on
shore
three
bale
of
english
good
,
such
as
fine
broad
-
cloth
,
stuff
,
and
some
linen
,
which
I
have
bring
for
a
present
to
my
partner
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
generous
,
broad
-
hearted
man
,
though
(
like
me
)
<EOS>
he
come
from
little
at
first
;
and
though
he
know
not
that
I
have
the
least
design
of
give
him
any
thing
,
he
send
me
on
board
a
present
of
fresh
provision
,
wine
,
and
sweetmeat
,
worth
above
thirty
moidore
,
include
some
tobacco
,
and
three
or
four
fine
medal
in
gold
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
even
with
him
in
my
present
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
consist
of
fine
broad
-
cloth
,
english
stuff
,
lace
,
and
fine
holland
.
<EOS>
also
,
I
deliver
him
about
the
value
of
100l
.
<EOS>
sterling
,
in
the
same
good
,
for
other
use
:
and
I
oblige
him
to
set
up
the
sloop
which
I
have
bring
with
me
from
England
,
as
I
have
say
,
for
the
use
of
my
colony
,
in
order
to
send
the
refreshment
I
intend
to
my
plantation
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
he
get
hand
,
and
finish
the
sloop
in
a
very
few
day
,
for
she
be
already
frame
;
and
I
give
the
master
of
her
such
instruction
as
he
could
not
miss
the
place
;
nor
do
he
miss
it
,
as
I
have
an
account
from
my
partner
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
get
him
soon
load
with
the
small
cargo
I
have
send
them
;
and
one
of
our
seaman
,
that
have
be
on
shore
with
me
there
,
offer
to
go
with
the
sloop
,
and
settle
there
,
upon
my
letter
to
the
governor
Spaniard
,
to
allot
him
a
sufficient
quantity
of
land
for
a
plantation
;
and
give
him
some
clothe
,
and
tool
for
his
planting
work
,
which
he
say
he
understand
,
have
be
an
old
planter
in
Maryland
,
and
a
buccaneer
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
I
encourage
the
fellow
by
grant
all
he
desire
;
and
,
as
an
addition
,
I
give
him
the
savage
which
we
have
take
prisoner
of
war
,
to
be
his
slave
,
and
order
the
governor
Spaniard
to
give
him
his
share
of
everything
he
want
,
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
fit
this
man
out
,
my
old
partner
tell
me
,
there
be
a
certain
very
honest
fellow
,
a
Brasil
planter
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
have
fall
into
he
displeasure
of
the
church
:
"
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
the
matter
be
with
him
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
,
on
my
conscience
,
I
think
he
be
a
heretic
in
his
heart
;
and
he
have
be
oblige
to
conceal
himself
for
fear
of
the
Inquisition
;
"
that
he
would
be
very
glad
of
such
an
opportunity
to
make
his
escape
,
with
his
wife
and
two
daughter
;
and
if
I
would
let
them
go
to
the
island
,
and
allot
them
a
plantation
,
he
would
give
them
a
small
stock
to
begin
with
;
for
the
officer
of
the
Inquisition
have
seize
all
his
effect
and
estate
,
and
he
have
nothing
leave
but
a
little
household
stuff
,
and
two
slave
;
<EOS>
"
and
,
"
add
he
,
"
though
I
hate
his
principle
,
yet
I
would
not
have
him
fall
into
their
hand
,
for
he
will
assuredly
be
burn
alive
if
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
grant
this
presently
,
and
join
my
Englishman
with
them
;
and
we
conceal
the
man
,
and
his
wife
and
daughter
,
on
board
our
ship
,
till
the
sloop
put
out
to
go
to
sea
;
and
then
(
have
put
all
their
good
on
board
the
sloop
some
time
before
)
we
put
them
on
board
the
sloop
,
after
she
be
get
out
of
the
bay
.
  
<EOS>
Our
seaman
be
mightily
pleased
with
this
new
partner
;
and
their
stock
,
indeed
,
be
much
alike
,
rich
in
tool
,
and
in
preparation
,
for
a
farm
;
but
nothing
to
begin
with
,
but
as
above
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
carry
over
with
them
(
which
be
worth
all
the
rest
)
<EOS>
some
material
for
plant
sugar
-
cane
,
with
some
plant
of
cane
;
which
he
(
I
mean
the
Portugal
man
)
understand
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
rest
of
the
supply
send
my
tenant
in
the
island
,
I
send
them
,
by
this
sloop
,
three
milch
-
cow
and
five
calf
,
about
twenty
-
two
hog
,
among
them
,
three
sow
big
with
pig
,
two
mare
,
and
a
stone
-
horse
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
Spaniards
,
accord
to
my
promise
,
I
engage
three
portugal
woman
to
go
;
and
recommend
it
to
them
to
marry
them
,
and
use
them
kindly
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
procure
more
woman
,
but
I
remember
that
the
poor
persecute
man
have
two
daughter
,
and
there
be
but
five
of
the
Spaniards
that
want
;
the
rest
have
wife
of
their
own
,
though
in
another
country
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
cargo
arrive
safe
,
and
,
as
you
may
easily
suppose
,
very
welcome
to
my
old
inhabitant
,
who
be
now
(
with
this
addition
)
between
sixty
and
seventy
people
,
besides
little
child
;
of
which
there
be
a
great
many
<EOS>
:
I
find
letter
at
London
from
them
all
,
by
way
of
Lisbon
,
when
I
come
back
to
England
,
be
send
back
to
the
Brasils
by
this
sloop
;
of
which
I
shall
take
some
notice
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
do
with
my
island
,
and
all
manner
of
discourse
about
it
;
and
whoever
read
the
rest
of
my
memorandum
,
would
do
well
to
turn
his
thought
entirely
from
it
,
and
expect
to
read
only
of
the
folly
of
an
old
man
,
not
warn
by
his
own
harm
,
much
less
by
those
of
other
man
,
to
beware
of
the
like
;
not
cool
by
almost
forty
year
misery
and
disappointment
;
not
satisfied
with
prosperity
beyond
expectation
;
not
make
cautious
by
affliction
and
distress
beyond
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
business
to
go
to
the
East
Indies
,
than
a
man
at
full
liberty
,
and
have
commit
no
crime
,
have
to
go
to
the
turnkey
at
Newgate
,
and
desire
him
to
lock
him
up
among
the
prisoner
there
,
and
starve
him
.
<EOS>
have
I
take
a
small
vessel
from
England
,
and
go
directly
to
the
island
;
have
I
load
her
,
as
I
do
the
other
vessel
,
with
all
the
necessary
for
the
plantation
,
and
for
my
people
;
take
a
patent
from
the
government
here
,
to
have
secure
my
property
,
in
subjection
only
to
that
of
England
,
which
,
to
be
sure
,
I
may
have
obtain
;
have
I
carry
over
cannon
and
ammunition
,
servant
,
and
people
to
plant
,
and
,
take
possession
of
the
place
,
fortify
and
strengthen
it
in
the
name
of
England
,
and
increase
it
with
people
,
as
I
may
easily
have
do
;
have
I
then
settle
myself
there
,
and
send
the
ship
back
,
load
with
good
rice
,
as
I
may
also
have
do
in
six
month
time
,
and
order
my
friend
to
have
fit
her
out
again
for
our
supply
;
have
I
do
this
,
and
staid
there
myself
,
I
have
,
at
least
,
act
like
a
man
of
common
sense
;
but
I
be
possess
with
a
wander
spirit
,
scorn
all
advantage
,
please
myself
with
be
the
patron
of
these
people
I
have
place
there
,
and
do
for
them
in
a
kind
of
haughty
majestic
way
,
like
an
old
patriarchal
monarch
;
provide
for
them
,
as
if
I
have
be
father
of
the
whole
family
,
as
well
as
of
the
plantation
:
but
I
never
so
much
as
pretend
to
plant
in
the
name
of
any
government
or
nation
,
or
to
acknowledge
any
prince
,
or
to
call
my
people
subject
to
any
one
nation
more
than
another
;
nay
,
I
never
so
much
as
give
the
place
a
name
;
but
leave
it
as
I
find
it
,
belong
to
no
man
;
and
the
people
under
no
discipline
or
government
but
my
own
;
who
,
though
I
have
an
influence
over
them
as
father
and
benefactor
,
have
no
authority
or
power
to
act
or
command
one
way
or
other
,
farther
than
voluntary
consent
move
them
to
comply
:
yet
even
this
,
have
I
staid
there
,
would
have
do
well
enough
;
but
as
I
ramble
from
them
,
and
come
thither
no
more
,
the
last
letter
I
have
from
any
of
them
,
be
by
my
partner
's
mean
,
who
afterwards
send
another
sloop
to
the
place
;
and
who
send
me
word
,
though
I
have
not
the
letter
till
five
year
after
it
be
write
,
that
they
go
on
but
poorly
,
be
malecontent
with
their
long
stay
there
;
that
Will
Atkins
be
dead
;
that
five
of
the
Spaniards
be
come
away
;
and
that
though
they
have
not
be
much
molest
by
the
savage
,
yet
they
have
have
some
skirmish
with
them
;
that
they
beg
of
him
to
write
to
me
to
think
of
the
promise
I
have
make
to
fetch
them
away
,
that
they
may
see
their
own
country
again
before
they
die
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
go
a
wild
-
goose
chase
indeed
,
and
they
who
will
have
any
more
of
me
,
must
be
content
to
follow
me
through
a
new
variety
of
folly
,
hardship
,
and
wild
adventure
;
wherein
the
justice
of
Providence
may
be
duly
observe
,
and
we
may
see
how
easily
Heaven
can
gorge
us
with
our
own
desire
,
make
the
strong
of
our
wish
to
be
our
affliction
and
punish
us
most
severely
with
those
very
thing
which
we
think
it
would
be
our
utmost
happiness
to
be
allow
in
.
  
<EOS>
let
no
wise
man
flat
himself
with
the
strength
of
his
own
judgment
,
as
if
he
be
able
to
choose
any
particular
station
of
life
for
himself
.
<EOS>
man
be
a
short
-
sight
creature
,
see
but
a
very
little
way
before
him
;
and
as
his
passion
be
none
of
his
good
friend
,
so
his
particular
affection
be
generally
his
bad
counsellor
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
this
with
respect
to
the
impetuous
desire
I
have
from
a
youth
to
wander
into
the
world
,
and
how
evident
it
now
be
that
this
principle
be
preserve
in
me
for
my
punishment
.
<EOS>
how
it
come
on
,
the
manner
,
the
circumstance
,
and
the
conclusion
of
it
,
it
be
easy
to
give
you
historically
,
and
with
its
utmost
variety
of
particular
.
<EOS>
but
the
secret
end
of
Divine
Providence
,
in
thus
permit
us
to
be
hurry
down
the
stream
of
our
own
desire
,
be
only
to
be
understand
of
those
who
can
listen
to
the
voice
of
Providence
,
and
draw
religious
consequence
from
God
's
justice
and
their
own
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
have
I
business
or
no
business
,
away
I
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
time
now
to
enlarge
any
farther
upon
the
reason
or
absurdity
of
my
own
conduct
;
but
to
come
to
the
history
 
<EOS>
I
be
embark
for
the
voyage
,
and
the
voyage
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
only
add
here
,
that
my
honest
and
truly
pious
clergyman
leave
me
here
;
a
ship
be
ready
to
go
to
Lisbon
,
he
ask
me
leave
to
go
thither
;
be
still
as
he
observe
,
bind
never
to
finish
any
voyage
he
begin
.
<EOS>
how
happy
have
it
be
for
me
if
I
have
go
with
him
!
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
now
;
all
thing
Heaven
appoint
be
good
.
<EOS>
have
I
go
with
him
,
I
have
never
have
so
many
thing
to
be
thankful
for
,
and
you
have
never
hear
of
the
Second
Part
of
the
Travels
and
Adventures
of
Robinson
Crusoe
;
so
I
must
leave
here
the
fruitless
exclaiming
at
myself
,
and
go
on
with
my
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
Brasils
we
make
directly
away
over
the
Atlantic
sea
to
the
Cape
de
Bonne
Esperance
,
or
,
as
we
call
it
,
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
;
and
have
a
tolerable
good
voyage
,
our
course
generally
south
-
east
;
now
and
then
a
storm
,
and
some
contrary
wind
.
<EOS>
but
my
disaster
at
sea
be
at
an
end
;
my
future
rub
and
cross
event
be
to
befal
me
on
shore
;
that
it
may
appear
the
land
be
as
well
prepared
to
be
our
scourge
as
the
sea
,
when
Heaven
,
who
direct
the
circumstance
of
thing
,
please
to
appoint
it
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
Our
ship
be
on
a
trading
voyage
,
and
have
a
supercargo
on
board
,
who
be
to
direct
all
her
motion
after
she
arrive
at
the
Cape
;
only
be
limit
to
a
certain
number
of
day
for
stay
,
by
charter
-
party
,
at
the
several
port
she
be
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
this
be
none
of
my
business
,
neither
do
I
meddle
with
it
at
all
;
my
nephew
the
captain
,
and
the
supercargo
,
adjust
all
those
thing
between
them
as
they
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
no
stay
at
the
Cape
longer
than
be
needful
to
take
in
fresh
water
,
but
make
the
good
of
our
way
for
the
coast
of
Coromandel
;
we
be
indeed
inform
that
a
french
man
of
war
of
fifty
gun
and
two
large
merchant
-
ship
be
go
for
the
Indies
;
and
as
I
know
we
be
at
war
with
France
,
I
have
some
apprehension
of
them
;
but
they
go
their
own
way
,
and
we
hear
no
more
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pester
my
account
,
or
the
reader
,
with
description
of
place
,
journal
of
our
voyage
,
variation
of
the
compass
,
latitude
,
meridian
distance
,
trade
-
wind
,
situation
of
port
,
and
the
like
;
such
as
almost
all
the
history
of
long
navigation
be
full
of
,
and
which
make
the
reading
tiresome
enough
,
and
be
perfectly
unprofitable
to
all
that
read
,
except
only
to
those
who
be
to
go
to
those
place
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
name
the
port
and
place
which
we
touch
at
,
and
what
occur
to
us
upon
our
pass
from
one
to
another
.
<EOS>
We
touch
first
at
the
island
of
Madagascar
,
where
,
though
the
people
be
fierce
and
treacherous
,
and
,
in
particular
,
very
well
armed
with
lance
and
bow
,
which
they
use
with
inconceivable
dexterity
,
yet
we
fare
very
well
with
them
awhile
;
they
treat
us
very
civilly
;
and
for
some
trifle
which
we
give
them
,
such
as
knife
,
scissor
,
&
c.
<EOS>
they
bring
us
eleven
good
fat
bullock
,
middle
in
size
,
but
very
good
in
flesh
,
which
we
take
in
,
partly
for
fresh
provision
for
our
present
spending
,
and
the
rest
to
salt
for
the
ship
's
use
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
oblige
to
stay
here
for
some
time
after
we
have
furnish
ourselves
with
provision
;
and
I
that
be
always
too
curious
to
look
into
every
nook
of
the
world
wherever
I
come
,
be
for
go
on
shore
as
often
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
east
side
of
the
island
that
we
go
on
shore
one
evening
,
and
the
people
,
who
by
the
way
be
very
numerous
,
come
throng
about
us
,
and
stand
gaze
at
us
at
a
distance
;
as
we
have
trade
freely
with
them
,
and
have
be
kindly
use
,
we
think
ourselves
in
no
danger
;
but
when
we
see
the
people
we
cut
three
bough
out
of
a
tree
,
and
stick
them
up
at
a
distance
from
us
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
a
mark
in
the
country
not
only
of
truce
and
friendship
,
but
when
it
be
accept
,
the
other
side
set
up
three
pole
or
bough
also
,
which
be
a
signal
that
they
accept
the
truce
too
;
but
then
this
be
a
know
condition
of
the
truce
,
that
you
be
not
to
pass
beyond
their
three
pole
towards
them
,
nor
they
come
past
your
three
pole
or
bough
towards
you
;
so
that
you
be
perfectly
secure
within
the
three
pole
,
and
all
the
space
between
your
pole
and
theirs
be
allow
like
a
market
for
free
converse
,
traffic
,
and
commerce
.
<EOS>
when
you
go
thither
you
must
not
carry
your
weapon
with
you
;
and
if
they
come
into
that
space
they
stick
up
their
javelin
and
lance
all
at
the
first
pole
,
and
come
on
unarmed
;
but
if
any
violence
be
offer
them
,
and
the
truce
thereby
break
,
away
they
run
to
the
pole
and
lie
hold
of
their
weapon
,
and
then
the
truce
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
one
evening
when
we
go
on
shore
,
that
a
great
number
of
their
people
come
down
than
usual
,
but
all
be
very
friendly
and
civil
.
<EOS>
They
bring
with
them
several
kind
of
provision
,
for
which
we
satisfy
them
with
such
toy
as
we
have
;
their
woman
also
bring
us
milk
and
root
,
and
several
thing
very
acceptable
to
us
,
and
all
be
quiet
;
and
we
make
us
a
little
tent
or
hut
,
of
some
bough
of
tree
,
and
lie
on
shore
all
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
be
the
occasion
,
but
I
be
not
so
well
satisfied
to
lie
on
shore
as
the
rest
;
and
the
boat
lie
at
an
anchor
about
a
stone
's
cast
from
the
land
,
with
two
man
in
her
to
take
care
of
her
,
I
make
one
of
them
come
on
shore
,
and
get
some
bough
of
tree
to
cover
us
also
in
the
boat
<EOS>
,
I
spread
the
sail
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
lie
on
board
,
under
the
cover
of
the
branch
of
the
tree
,
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
<EOS>
we
hear
one
of
our
man
make
a
terrible
noise
on
the
shore
,
call
out
for
God
's
sake
to
bring
the
boat
in
,
and
come
and
help
them
,
for
they
be
all
like
to
be
murder
;
at
the
same
time
I
hear
the
firing
of
five
musket
,
which
be
the
number
of
the
gun
they
have
,
and
that
three
time
over
;
for
,
it
seem
,
the
native
here
be
not
so
easily
fright
with
gun
as
the
savage
be
in
America
,
where
I
have
to
do
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
I
know
not
what
be
the
matter
;
but
rouse
immediately
from
sleep
with
the
noise
,
I
cause
the
boat
to
be
thrust
in
,
and
resolve
,
with
three
fusil
we
have
on
board
,
to
land
and
assist
our
man
.
  
<EOS>
We
get
the
boat
soon
to
the
shore
;
but
our
man
be
in
too
much
haste
;
for
be
come
to
the
shore
,
they
plunge
into
the
water
to
get
to
the
boat
with
all
the
expedition
they
could
,
be
pursue
by
between
three
and
four
hundred
man
.
<EOS>
Our
man
be
but
nine
in
all
,
and
only
five
of
them
have
fusil
with
them
;
the
rest
,
indeed
,
have
pistol
and
sword
,
but
they
be
of
small
use
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
up
seven
of
our
man
,
and
with
difficulty
enough
too
,
three
of
them
be
very
ill
wound
;
and
that
which
be
still
bad
be
,
that
while
we
stand
in
the
boat
to
take
our
man
in
,
we
be
in
as
much
danger
as
they
be
in
on
shore
;
for
they
pour
their
arrow
in
upon
us
so
thick
,
that
we
be
fain
to
barricade
the
side
of
the
boat
up
with
the
bench
and
two
or
three
loose
board
,
which
to
our
great
satisfaction
we
have
by
mere
accident
,
or
providence
rather
,
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
have
it
be
daylight
<EOS>
,
they
be
,
it
seem
,
such
exact
marksman
,
that
if
they
could
have
see
but
the
least
part
of
any
of
us
,
they
would
have
be
sure
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
have
,
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
a
little
sight
of
them
as
they
stand
pelt
us
from
the
shore
with
dart
and
arrow
,
and
have
get
ready
<EOS>
our
fire
-
arm
,
we
give
them
a
volley
,
and
we
could
hear
by
the
cry
of
some
of
them
,
that
we
have
wound
several
;
however
,
they
stand
thus
in
battle
array
on
the
shore
till
break
of
day
,
which
we
suppose
be
that
they
may
see
the
well
to
take
their
aim
at
us
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
we
lay
,
and
could
not
tell
how
to
weigh
our
anchor
,
or
set
up
our
sail
,
because
we
must
needs
stand
up
in
the
boat
,
and
they
be
as
sure
to
hit
us
as
we
be
to
hit
a
bird
in
a
tree
with
small
shot
.
<EOS>
We
make
signal
of
distress
to
the
ship
,
which
though
she
ride
a
league
off
,
yet
my
nephew
,
the
captain
,
hear
our
firing
,
and
by
glass
perceive
the
posture
we
lay
in
,
and
that
we
fire
towards
the
shore
,
pretty
well
understand
us
;
and
weigh
anchor
with
all
speed
,
he
stand
as
near
the
shore
as
he
durst
with
the
ship
,
and
then
send
another
boat
with
ten
hand
in
her
to
assist
us
;
but
we
call
to
them
not
to
come
too
near
,
tell
them
what
condition
we
be
in
;
however
,
they
stand
in
nearer
to
us
;
and
one
of
the
man
take
the
end
of
a
tow
-
line
in
his
hand
,
and
keep
our
boat
between
him
and
the
enemy
,
so
that
they
could
not
perfectly
see
him
,
swam
on
board
us
,
and
make
the
line
fast
to
the
boat
,
upon
which
we
slipt
our
little
cable
,
and
leave
our
anchor
behind
,
they
tow
us
out
of
the
reach
of
the
arrow
,
we
all
the
while
lie
close
behind
the
barricade
we
have
make
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
get
from
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
,
that
she
could
lay
her
side
to
the
shore
,
we
run
along
just
by
them
,
and
we
pour
in
a
broadside
among
them
,
load
with
piece
of
iron
and
lead
,
small
bullet
,
and
such
stuff
,
besides
the
great
shot
,
which
make
a
terrible
havoc
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
get
on
board
and
out
of
danger
,
we
have
time
to
examine
into
the
occasion
of
this
fray
;
and
indeed
our
supercargo
,
who
have
be
often
in
those
part
,
put
me
upon
it
;
for
he
say
he
be
sure
the
inhabitant
would
not
have
touch
us
after
we
have
make
a
truce
,
if
we
have
not
do
something
to
provoke
them
to
it
.
<EOS>
at
length
it
come
out
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
an
old
woman
,
who
have
come
to
sell
us
some
milk
,
have
bring
it
within
our
pole
,
with
a
young
woman
with
her
,
who
also
bring
some
root
or
herb
;
and
while
the
old
woman
(
whether
she
be
mother
to
the
young
woman
or
no
they
could
not
tell
)
be
sell
us
the
milk
,
one
of
our
man
offer
some
rudeness
to
the
wench
that
be
with
her
,
at
which
the
old
woman
make
a
great
noise
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
seaman
would
not
quit
his
prize
,
but
carry
her
out
of
the
old
woman
's
sight
,
among
the
tree
,
it
be
almost
dark
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
go
away
without
her
,
and
,
as
we
suppose
,
make
an
outcry
among
the
people
she
come
from
;
who
,
upon
notice
,
raise
this
great
army
upon
us
in
three
or
four
hour
;
and
it
be
great
odd
<EOS>
but
we
have
be
all
destroy
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
our
man
be
kill
with
a
lance
that
be
throw
at
him
,
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
attack
,
as
he
sally
out
of
the
tent
we
have
make
;
the
rest
come
off
free
,
all
but
the
fellow
who
be
the
occasion
of
all
the
mischief
,
who
pay
dear
enough
for
his
black
mistress
,
for
we
could
not
hear
what
become
of
him
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
We
lay
upon
the
shore
two
day
after
,
though
the
wind
present
,
and
make
signal
for
him
;
make
our
boat
sail
up
shore
and
down
shore
several
league
,
but
in
vain
;
so
we
be
oblige
to
give
him
over
;
and
if
he
alone
have
suffer
for
it
,
the
loss
have
be
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
,
however
,
without
venture
on
shore
once
more
,
to
try
if
I
could
learn
any
thing
of
him
or
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
third
night
after
the
action
that
I
have
a
great
mind
to
learn
,
if
I
could
by
any
mean
,
what
mischief
he
have
do
,
and
how
the
game
stand
on
the
indian
side
.
<EOS>
I
be
careful
to
do
it
in
the
dark
,
lest
we
should
be
attack
again
;
but
I
ought
indeed
to
have
be
sure
that
the
man
I
go
with
have
be
under
my
command
before
I
engage
in
a
thing
so
hazardous
and
mischievous
,
as
I
be
bring
into
it
without
my
knowledge
or
desire
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
twenty
stout
fellow
with
us
as
any
in
the
ship
,
besides
the
supercargo
and
myself
;
and
we
land
two
hour
before
midnight
,
at
the
same
place
where
the
Indians
stand
draw
up
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
I
land
here
,
because
my
design
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
chiefly
to
see
if
they
have
quit
the
field
,
and
if
they
have
leave
any
mark
behind
them
,
or
of
the
mischief
we
have
do
them
;
and
I
think
if
we
could
surprise
one
or
two
of
them
,
perhaps
we
may
get
our
man
again
by
way
of
exchange
.
  
<EOS>
We
land
without
any
noise
,
and
divide
our
man
into
two
company
,
whereof
the
boatswain
command
one
,
and
I
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
neither
could
hear
nor
see
any
body
stir
when
we
land
;
so
we
march
up
,
one
body
at
a
distance
from
the
other
,
to
the
field
of
battle
.
<EOS>
at
first
we
could
see
nothing
,
it
be
very
dark
;
but
by
and
by
our
boatswain
,
that
lead
the
first
party
,
stumble
and
fall
over
a
dead
body
.
<EOS>
this
make
them
halt
there
awhile
;
for
know
by
the
circumstance
that
they
be
at
the
place
where
the
Indians
have
stand
,
they
wait
for
my
come
up
.
<EOS>
here
we
conclude
to
halt
till
the
moon
begin
to
rise
,
which
we
know
would
be
in
less
than
an
hour
,
and
then
we
could
easily
discern
the
havoc
we
have
make
among
them
.
<EOS>
We
tell
two
-
and
-
thirty
body
upon
the
ground
,
whereof
two
be
not
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
some
have
an
arm
,
and
some
a
leg
,
shoot
off
,
and
one
his
head
;
those
that
be
wound
we
suppose
they
have
carry
away
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
make
,
as
I
think
,
a
full
discovery
of
all
we
could
come
at
the
knowledge
of
<EOS>
,
I
be
for
go
on
board
again
;
but
the
boatswain
and
his
party
often
send
me
word
,
that
they
be
resolve
to
make
a
visit
to
the
indian
town
,
where
these
dog
,
as
they
call
them
,
dwelt
,
and
desire
me
to
go
along
with
them
,
and
if
they
could
find
them
,
as
they
still
fancy
they
should
,
they
do
not
doubt
,
they
say
,
get
a
good
booty
,
and
it
may
be
they
may
find
Thomas
Jeffrys
there
,
that
be
the
man
's
name
we
have
lose
.
  
<EOS>
have
they
send
to
ask
my
leave
to
go
,
I
know
well
enough
<EOS>
what
answer
to
have
give
them
;
for
I
would
have
command
them
instantly
on
board
,
know
it
be
not
a
hazard
fit
for
us
to
run
who
have
a
ship
and
a
ship
's
loading
in
our
charge
,
and
a
voyage
to
make
,
which
depend
very
much
upon
the
life
of
the
man
;
but
as
they
send
me
word
they
be
resolve
to
go
,
and
only
ask
me
and
my
company
to
go
along
with
them
,
I
positively
refuse
it
,
and
rise
up
(
for
I
be
sit
on
the
ground
)
in
order
to
go
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
the
man
begin
to
importune
me
to
go
,
and
when
I
still
refuse
positively
,
begin
to
grumble
,
and
say
they
be
not
under
my
command
,
and
they
would
go
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
Jack
,
"
say
one
of
the
man
,
"
will
you
go
with
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
go
for
one
.
"
<EOS>
Jack
say
he
would
;
and
another
follow
,
and
then
another
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
they
all
leave
me
but
one
,
whom
,
with
much
difficulty
too
,
I
persuade
to
stay
;
so
the
supercargo
and
I
,
with
one
man
,
go
back
to
the
boat
,
where
,
I
tell
them
,
we
would
stay
for
them
,
and
take
care
to
take
in
as
many
of
them
as
should
be
leave
;
for
I
tell
them
it
be
a
mad
thing
they
be
go
about
,
and
suppose
most
of
them
would
run
the
fate
of
Thomas
Jeffrys
.
  
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
like
seaman
,
they
would
warrant
it
they
would
come
off
again
,
and
they
would
take
care
,
&
c.
<EOS>
so
away
they
go
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
them
to
consider
the
ship
and
the
voyage
;
that
their
life
be
not
their
own
;
and
that
they
be
entrust
with
the
voyage
in
some
measure
;
that
if
they
miscarry
,
the
ship
may
be
lose
for
want
of
their
help
;
and
that
they
could
not
answer
it
to
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
I
say
a
great
deal
more
to
them
on
that
head
,
but
I
may
as
well
have
talk
to
the
main
-
mast
of
the
ship
;
they
be
mad
upon
their
journey
;
only
they
give
me
good
word
,
and
beg
I
would
not
be
angry
;
say
they
would
be
very
cautious
,
and
they
do
not
doubt
but
they
would
be
back
again
in
about
an
hour
at
farth
;
for
the
indian
town
<EOS>
,
they
say
,
be
not
above
half
a
mile
off
;
though
they
find
it
above
two
mile
before
they
get
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
they
all
go
away
as
above
;
and
though
the
attempt
be
desperate
,
and
such
as
none
but
madman
would
have
go
about
,
yet
,
to
give
them
their
due
,
they
go
about
it
warily
as
well
as
boldly
.
<EOS>
They
be
gallantly
armed
,
that
be
true
;
for
they
have
every
man
a
fusil
or
musket
,
a
bayonet
,
and
every
man
a
pistol
;
some
of
them
have
broad
cutlass
,
<EOS>
some
of
them
hanger
,
and
the
boatswain
and
two
more
have
pole
-
axis
;
besides
all
which
they
have
among
them
thirteen
hand
-
grenadoe
.
<EOS>
bolder
fellow
,
and
better
provide
,
never
go
about
any
wicked
work
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
go
out
their
chief
design
be
plund
,
and
they
be
in
mighty
hope
of
find
gold
there
;
but
a
circumstance
,
which
none
of
them
be
aware
of
,
set
them
on
fire
with
revenge
,
and
make
devil
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
few
indian
house
,
which
they
think
have
be
the
town
,
which
be
not
above
half
a
mile
off
,
they
be
under
a
great
disappointment
;
for
there
be
not
above
twelve
or
thirteen
house
;
and
where
the
town
be
,
or
how
big
,
they
know
not
.
<EOS>
They
consult
therefore
what
to
do
,
and
be
some
time
before
they
could
resolve
;
for
if
they
fall
upon
these
they
must
cut
all
their
throat
,
and
it
be
ten
to
one
but
some
of
them
may
escape
,
it
be
in
the
night
,
though
the
moon
be
up
;
and
if
one
escape
he
would
run
away
,
and
raise
all
the
town
,
so
they
should
have
a
whole
army
upon
them
.
<EOS>
again
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
they
go
away
,
and
leave
those
untouched
(
for
the
people
be
all
asleep
)
,
they
could
not
tell
which
way
to
look
for
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
last
be
the
good
advice
;
so
they
resolve
to
leave
those
house
,
and
look
for
the
town
as
well
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
They
go
on
a
little
way
,
and
find
a
cow
tie
to
a
tree
:
this
they
presently
conclude
would
be
a
good
guide
to
them
;
for
they
say
the
cow
certainly
belong
to
the
town
before
them
or
the
town
behind
them
,
and
if
they
untie
her
they
should
see
which
way
she
go
:
if
she
go
back
they
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
,
but
if
she
go
forward
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
her
;
so
they
cut
the
cord
,
which
be
make
of
twist
flag
,
and
the
cow
go
on
before
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
cow
lead
them
directly
to
the
town
,
which
,
as
they
report
,
consist
of
above
two
hundred
house
or
hut
;
and
in
some
of
these
they
find
several
family
live
together
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
find
all
silent
;
as
profoundly
secure
as
sleep
and
a
country
that
have
never
see
an
enemy
of
that
kind
could
make
them
.
<EOS>
upon
this
they
call
another
council
to
consider
what
they
have
to
do
,
and
in
a
word
they
resolve
to
divide
themselves
into
three
body
,
and
to
set
three
house
on
fire
in
three
part
of
the
town
;
and
as
the
man
come
out
,
to
seize
them
and
bind
them
;
if
any
resist
,
they
nee
not
be
ask
what
to
do
then
,
and
so
to
search
the
rest
of
the
house
for
plunder
;
but
resolve
to
march
silently
first
through
the
town
,
and
see
what
dimension
it
be
of
,
and
consider
if
they
may
venture
upon
it
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
They
do
so
,
and
desperately
resolve
that
they
would
venture
upon
them
;
but
while
they
be
animate
one
another
to
the
work
,
three
of
them
that
be
a
little
before
the
rest
call
out
aloud
,
and
tell
them
they
have
find
Thomas
Jeffrys
;
they
all
run
up
to
the
place
;
and
so
it
be
indeed
,
<EOS>
for
there
they
find
the
poor
fellow
,
hang
up
naked
by
one
arm
,
and
his
throat
cut
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
indian
house
just
by
the
tree
,
where
they
find
sixteen
or
seventeen
of
the
principal
Indians
who
have
be
concern
in
the
fray
with
us
before
,
and
two
or
three
of
them
wound
with
our
shot
;
and
our
man
find
they
be
awake
,
and
talk
one
to
another
in
that
house
,
but
know
not
their
number
.
  
<EOS>
the
sight
of
their
poor
mangle
comrade
so
enrage
them
,
as
before
,
that
they
swear
to
one
another
they
would
be
revenge
,
and
that
not
an
Indian
who
come
into
their
hand
should
have
quarter
;
and
to
work
they
go
immediately
,
and
yet
not
so
madly
as
by
the
rage
and
fury
they
be
in
may
be
expect
.
<EOS>
Their
first
care
be
to
get
something
that
would
soon
take
fire
;
but
after
a
little
search
they
find
that
would
be
to
no
purpose
,
for
most
of
the
house
be
low
,
and
thatch
with
flag
or
rush
,
of
which
the
country
be
full
:
so
they
presently
make
some
wildfire
,
as
we
call
it
,
by
wet
a
little
powder
in
the
palm
of
their
hand
;
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
set
the
town
on
fire
in
four
or
five
place
,
and
particularly
that
house
where
the
Indians
be
not
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
fire
begin
to
blaze
,
the
poor
frighted
creature
begin
to
rush
out
to
save
their
life
,
but
meet
with
their
fate
in
the
attempt
,
and
especially
at
the
door
,
where
they
drive
them
back
,
the
boatswain
himself
kill
one
or
two
with
his
pole
-
axe
;
the
house
be
large
,
and
many
in
it
,
he
do
not
care
to
go
in
,
but
call
for
an
hand
-
grenado
,
and
throw
it
among
them
,
which
at
first
fright
them
;
but
when
it
burst
make
such
havoc
among
them
,
that
they
cry
out
in
a
hideous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
most
of
the
Indians
who
be
in
the
open
part
of
the
house
,
be
kill
or
hurt
with
the
grenado
,
except
two
or
three
more
,
who
press
to
the
door
,
which
the
boatswain
and
two
more
keep
with
the
bayonet
in
the
muzzle
of
their
piece
,
and
dispatch
all
who
come
that
way
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
apartment
in
the
house
,
where
the
prince
,
or
king
,
or
whatsoever
he
be
,
and
several
other
,
be
;
and
they
keep
in
till
the
house
,
which
be
by
this
time
all
of
a
light
flame
,
fall
in
upon
them
,
and
they
be
smother
or
burn
together
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
they
fire
not
a
gun
,
because
they
would
not
waken
the
people
faster
than
they
could
master
them
;
but
the
fire
begin
to
waken
them
fast
enough
,
and
our
fellow
be
glad
to
keep
a
little
together
in
body
;
for
the
fire
grow
so
rage
,
all
the
house
be
make
of
light
combustible
stuff
,
that
they
could
hardly
bear
the
street
between
them
,
and
their
business
be
to
follow
the
fire
for
the
sure
execution
.
<EOS>
as
fast
as
the
fire
either
force
the
people
out
of
those
house
which
be
burn
,
or
fright
them
out
of
other
,
our
people
be
ready
at
their
door
to
knock
them
on
the
head
,
still
call
and
halloo
to
one
another
to
remember
Thomas
Jeffrys
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
I
must
confess
I
be
very
uneasy
,
and
especially
when
I
see
the
flame
of
the
town
,
which
,
it
be
night
,
seem
to
be
just
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
the
captain
,
who
be
rouse
by
his
man
too
,
see
such
a
fire
,
be
very
uneasy
,
not
know
what
the
matter
be
,
or
what
danger
<EOS>
I
be
in
;
especially
hear
the
gun
too
,
for
by
this
time
they
begin
to
use
their
fire
-
arm
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
thought
oppress
his
mind
concern
me
and
the
supercargo
<EOS>
,
what
should
become
of
us
;
and
at
last
,
though
he
could
ill
spare
any
more
man
,
yet
,
not
know
what
exigence
we
may
be
in
,
he
take
another
boat
,
and
with
thirteen
man
and
himself
come
on
shore
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
surprised
to
see
me
and
the
supercargo
in
the
boat
with
no
more
than
two
man
,
for
one
have
be
leave
to
keep
the
boat
;
and
though
he
be
glad
that
we
be
well
,
yet
he
be
in
the
same
impatience
with
us
to
know
what
be
do
,
for
the
noise
continue
and
the
flame
increase
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
be
next
to
an
impossibility
for
any
man
in
the
world
to
restrain
their
curiosity
of
know
what
have
happen
,
or
their
concern
for
the
safety
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
captain
tell
me
he
would
go
and
help
his
man
,
let
what
would
come
.
<EOS>
I
argue
with
him
,
as
I
do
before
with
the
man
,
the
safety
of
the
ship
,
and
the
danger
of
the
voyage
,
the
interest
of
the
owner
and
merchant
,
&
c.
and
tell
him
I
would
go
,
and
the
two
man
,
and
only
see
if
we
could
,
at
a
distance
,
learn
what
be
like
to
be
the
event
,
and
come
back
and
tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
to
talk
to
my
nephew
,
as
it
be
to
talk
to
the
rest
before
;
he
would
go
,
he
say
,
and
he
only
wish
he
have
leave
<EOS>
but
ten
man
in
the
ship
,
for
he
could
not
think
of
have
his
man
lose
for
want
of
help
;
he
have
rather
,
he
say
,
lose
the
ship
,
the
voyage
,
and
his
life
,
and
all
:
and
so
away
go
he
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
I
any
more
able
to
stay
behind
now
than
I
be
to
persuade
them
not
to
go
before
;
so
,
in
short
,
the
captain
order
two
man
to
row
back
the
pinnace
,
and
fetch
twelve
man
more
from
the
ship
,
leave
the
long
-
boat
at
an
anchor
;
and
that
when
they
come
back
six
man
should
keep
the
two
boat
,
and
six
more
come
after
us
,
so
that
he
leave
only
sixteen
man
in
the
ship
;
for
the
whole
ship
's
company
consist
of
sixty
-
five
man
,
whereof
two
be
lose
in
the
first
quarrel
which
bring
this
mischief
on
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
on
the
march
,
you
may
be
sure
we
feel
little
of
the
ground
we
tread
on
,
and
be
guide
by
the
fire
we
keep
no
path
,
but
go
directly
to
the
place
of
the
flame
.
<EOS>
if
the
noise
of
the
gun
be
surprising
to
us
before
,
the
cry
of
the
poor
people
be
now
quite
of
another
nature
,
and
fill
us
with
horror
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
I
never
be
at
the
sacking
of
a
city
,
or
at
the
taking
of
a
town
by
storm
;
I
have
hear
of
Oliver
Cromwell
take
Drogheda
in
Ireland
,
and
kill
man
,
woman
,
and
child
;
and
I
have
read
of
Count
Tilly
sack
the
city
of
Magdebourg
,
and
cut
the
throat
of
22,000
of
both
sex
;
but
I
never
have
an
idea
of
the
thing
itself
before
,
nor
be
it
possible
to
describe
it
,
or
the
horror
which
be
upon
our
mind
at
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
we
go
on
,
and
at
length
come
to
the
town
,
though
there
be
no
enter
the
street
of
it
for
the
fire
.
<EOS>
the
first
object
we
meet
with
be
the
ruin
of
a
hut
or
house
,
or
rather
the
ashe
of
it
,
for
the
house
be
consume
;
and
just
before
it
,
plain
now
to
be
see
by
the
light
of
the
fire
,
lie
four
man
and
three
woman
kill
;
and
,
as
we
think
,
one
or
two
more
lie
in
the
heap
among
the
fire
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
these
be
such
instance
of
a
rage
altogether
barbarous
,
and
of
a
fury
something
beyond
what
be
human
,
that
we
think
it
impossible
our
man
could
be
guilty
of
it
;
or
if
they
be
the
author
of
it
,
we
think
that
every
one
of
them
ought
to
be
put
to
the
bad
of
death
:
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
;
we
see
the
fire
increase
forward
,
and
the
cry
go
on
just
as
the
fire
go
on
,
so
that
we
be
in
the
utmost
confusion
.
<EOS>
We
advance
a
little
way
farther
,
and
beheld
to
our
astonishment
three
woman
naked
,
cry
in
a
most
dreadful
manner
,
and
fly
as
if
they
have
indeed
have
wing
,
and
after
them
sixteen
or
seventeen
man
,
native
,
in
the
same
terror
and
consternation
,
with
three
of
our
english
butcher
(
for
I
can
call
them
no
better
)
in
the
rear
,
who
,
when
they
could
not
overtake
them
,
fire
in
among
them
,
and
one
that
be
kill
by
their
shot
fall
down
in
our
sight
:
when
the
rest
see
us
,
believe
us
to
be
their
enemy
;
and
that
we
would
murder
them
as
well
as
those
that
pursue
them
,
they
set
up
a
most
dreadful
shriek
,
especially
the
woman
,
and
two
of
them
fall
down
as
if
already
dead
with
the
fright
.
  
<EOS>
My
very
soul
shrink
within
me
,
and
my
blood
run
chill
in
my
vein
,
when
I
see
this
;
and
I
believe
have
the
three
english
sailor
that
pursue
them
come
on
,
I
have
make
our
man
kill
them
all
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
take
some
way
to
let
the
poor
flying
creature
know
that
we
would
not
hurt
them
,
and
immediately
they
come
up
to
us
,
and
kneel
down
,
with
their
hand
lift
up
,
make
piteous
lamentation
to
us
to
save
them
,
which
we
let
them
know
we
would
do
;
where
upon
they
keep
all
together
in
a
huddle
close
behind
us
for
protection
.
<EOS>
I
leave
my
man
draw
up
together
,
and
charge
them
to
hurt
nobody
,
but
if
possible
to
get
at
some
of
our
people
,
and
see
what
devil
it
be
possess
them
,
and
what
they
intend
to
do
;
and
in
a
word
to
command
them
off
,
assure
them
that
if
they
staid
till
daylight
they
would
have
a
hundred
thousand
man
about
their
ear
:
I
say
,
I
leave
them
and
go
among
those
fly
people
,
take
only
two
of
our
man
with
me
;
and
there
be
indeed
a
piteous
spectacle
among
them
:
<EOS>
some
of
them
have
their
foot
terribly
burn
with
trample
and
run
through
the
fire
,
other
their
hand
burn
;
one
of
the
woman
have
fall
down
in
the
fire
,
and
be
almost
burn
to
death
before
she
could
get
out
again
;
two
or
three
of
the
man
have
cut
in
their
back
and
thigh
,
from
our
man
pursue
,
and
another
be
shoot
through
the
body
,
and
die
while
I
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
learn
what
the
occasion
of
all
this
be
,
but
I
could
not
understand
one
word
they
say
,
though
by
sign
I
perceive
that
some
of
them
know
not
what
be
the
occasion
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
terrified
in
my
thought
at
this
outrageous
attempt
,
that
I
could
not
stay
there
,
but
go
back
to
my
own
man
<EOS>
:
I
tell
them
my
resolution
,
and
command
them
to
follow
me
,
when
in
the
very
moment
come
four
of
our
man
,
with
the
boatswain
at
their
head
,
run
over
the
heap
of
body
they
have
kill
,
all
cover
with
blood
and
dust
,
as
if
they
want
more
people
to
massacre
,
when
our
man
halloo
to
them
as
loud
as
they
could
halloo
,
and
with
much
ado
one
of
them
make
them
hear
,
so
that
they
know
who
we
be
,
and
come
up
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
boatswain
see
us
he
set
up
a
halloo
,
like
a
shout
of
triumph
,
for
have
,
as
he
think
,
more
help
come
;
and
without
bear
to
hear
me
,
"
captain
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
noble
captain
,
I
be
glad
you
be
come
;
we
have
not
half
do
yet
:
villain
!
<EOS>
hell
-
hound
dog
!
<EOS>
I
will
kill
as
many
of
them
as
poor
Tom
have
hair
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
We
have
swear
to
spare
none
of
them
;
we
will
root
out
the
very
name
of
them
from
the
earth
.
"
<EOS>
and
thus
he
run
on
,
out
of
breath
too
with
action
,
and
would
not
give
us
leave
to
speak
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
raise
my
voice
,
that
I
may
silence
him
a
little
,
"
barbarous
dog
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
what
be
you
do
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
one
creature
touch
more
upon
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
I
charge
you
upon
your
life
to
stop
your
hand
,
and
stand
still
here
,
or
you
be
a
dead
man
this
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
you
know
what
you
do
,
or
what
they
have
do
?
<EOS>
if
you
want
a
reason
for
what
we
have
do
,
come
hither
;
"
and
with
that
he
shew
me
the
poor
fellow
hang
upon
a
tree
,
with
his
throat
cut
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
urge
then
myself
,
and
at
another
time
should
have
be
forward
enough
;
but
I
think
they
have
carry
their
rage
too
far
,
and
think
of
Jacob
's
word
to
his
son
Simeon
and
Levi
,
"
curse
be
their
anger
,
for
it
be
fierce
;
and
their
wrath
,
for
it
be
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
now
a
new
task
upon
my
hand
;
for
when
the
man
I
carry
with
me
see
the
sight
as
I
have
do
,
I
have
as
much
to
do
to
restrain
them
,
as
I
should
have
have
with
the
other
;
nay
,
my
nephew
himself
fall
in
with
them
,
and
tell
me
in
their
hearing
,
that
he
be
only
concern
for
fear
of
the
man
be
overpower
;
for
,
as
to
the
people
,
he
think
not
one
of
them
ought
to
live
;
for
they
have
all
glut
themselves
with
the
murder
of
the
poor
man
,
and
that
they
ought
to
be
use
like
murderer
.
<EOS>
upon
these
word
away
run
eight
of
my
man
with
the
boatswain
and
his
crew
to
complete
their
bloody
work
;
and
I
,
see
it
quite
out
of
my
power
to
restrain
them
,
come
away
pensive
and
sad
,
for
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
,
much
less
the
horrible
noise
and
cry
of
the
poor
wretch
that
fall
into
their
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
nobody
to
come
back
with
me
but
the
supercargo
and
two
man
,
and
with
these
I
walk
back
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
great
piece
of
folly
in
me
,
I
confess
,
to
venture
back
as
it
be
alone
;
for
as
it
begin
now
to
be
almost
day
,
and
the
alarm
have
run
over
the
country
,
there
stand
about
forty
man
arm
with
lance
and
bow
at
the
little
place
where
the
twelve
or
thirteen
house
stand
mention
before
,
but
by
accident
I
miss
the
place
,
and
come
directly
to
the
sea
-
side
;
and
by
that
time
I
get
to
the
sea
-
side
it
be
broad
day
:
immediately
I
take
the
pinnace
and
go
aboard
,
and
send
her
back
to
assist
the
man
in
what
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
that
about
the
time
I
come
to
the
boat
-
side
the
fire
be
pretty
well
out
,
and
the
noise
abate
;
but
in
about
half
an
hour
after
I
get
on
board
I
hear
a
volley
of
our
man
's
fire
-
arm
,
and
see
a
great
smoke
;
this
,
as
I
understand
afterwards
,
be
our
man
fall
upon
the
forty
man
,
who
,
as
I
say
,
stand
at
the
few
house
on
the
way
;
of
whom
they
kill
sixteen
or
seventeen
,
and
set
all
those
house
on
fire
,
but
do
not
meddle
with
the
woman
or
child
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
man
get
to
the
shore
again
with
the
pinnace
our
man
begin
to
appear
;
they
come
drop
in
some
and
some
,
not
in
two
body
,
and
in
form
,
as
they
go
out
,
but
all
in
heap
,
straggle
here
and
there
in
such
a
manner
that
a
small
force
of
resolute
man
may
have
cut
them
all
off
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
dread
of
them
be
upon
the
whole
country
.
<EOS>
the
people
be
amazed
and
surprised
,
and
so
fright
that
I
believe
a
hundred
of
them
would
have
flee
at
the
sight
of
but
five
of
our
man
.
<EOS>
nor
in
all
this
terrible
action
be
there
a
man
who
make
any
considerable
defence
;
they
be
so
surprised
between
the
terror
of
the
fire
,
and
the
sudden
attack
of
our
man
in
the
dark
,
that
they
know
not
which
way
to
turn
themselves
;
for
if
they
flee
one
way
they
be
meet
by
one
party
,
if
back
again
by
another
;
so
that
they
be
every
where
knock
down
.
<EOS>
nor
do
any
of
our
man
receive
the
least
hurt
,
except
one
who
strain
his
foot
,
and
another
have
one
of
his
hand
very
much
burn
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
angry
with
my
nephew
the
captain
,
and
indeed
with
all
the
man
,
in
my
mind
,
but
with
him
in
particular
,
as
well
for
his
acting
so
out
of
his
duty
,
as
commander
of
the
ship
,
and
have
the
charge
of
the
voyage
upon
him
,
as
in
his
prompting
rather
than
cool
the
rage
of
his
man
in
so
bloody
and
cruel
an
enterprise
:
my
nephew
answer
me
very
respectfully
,
but
tell
me
that
when
he
see
the
body
of
the
poor
seaman
whom
they
have
murder
in
such
a
cruel
and
barbarous
manner
,
he
be
not
master
of
himself
,
neither
could
he
govern
his
passion
;
he
own
he
should
not
have
do
so
,
as
he
be
commander
of
the
ship
,
but
as
he
be
a
man
,
and
nature
move
him
,
he
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
rest
of
the
man
,
they
be
not
subject
to
me
at
all
,
and
they
know
it
well
enough
,
so
they
take
no
notice
of
my
dislike
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
we
set
sail
,
so
we
never
hear
any
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
Our
man
differ
in
the
account
of
the
number
they
kill
;
some
say
one
thing
,
some
another
;
but
accord
to
the
good
of
their
account
,
put
all
together
,
they
kill
or
destroy
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
people
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
and
leave
not
a
house
stand
in
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
poor
fellow
,
Thomas
Jeffrys
,
as
he
be
quite
dead
,
for
his
throat
be
so
cut
that
his
head
be
half
off
,
it
would
do
him
no
service
to
bring
him
away
;
so
they
leave
him
where
they
find
him
,
only
take
him
down
from
the
tree
where
he
be
hang
by
one
hand
.
  
<EOS>
however
just
our
man
think
this
action
to
be
,
I
be
against
them
in
it
,
and
I
always
after
that
time
tell
them
God
would
blast
the
voyage
;
for
I
look
upon
the
blood
they
shed
that
night
to
be
murder
in
them
:
<EOS>
for
though
it
be
true
that
they
kill
Thomas
Jeffrys
,
yet
it
be
as
true
that
Jeffrys
be
the
aggressor
,
have
break
the
truce
,
and
have
violate
or
debauch
a
young
woman
of
theirs
,
who
come
to
our
camp
innocently
,
and
on
the
faith
of
their
capitulation
.
  
<EOS>
the
boatswain
defend
this
quarrel
when
we
be
afterwards
on
board
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
it
be
true
that
we
seem
to
break
the
truce
,
but
really
have
not
,
and
that
the
war
be
begin
the
night
before
by
the
native
themselves
,
who
have
shoot
at
us
,
and
kill
one
of
our
man
without
any
just
provocation
;
so
that
as
we
be
in
a
capacity
to
fight
them
,
we
may
also
be
in
a
capacity
to
do
ourselves
justice
upon
them
in
an
extraordinary
manner
;
that
though
the
poor
man
have
take
liberty
with
a
wench
,
he
ought
not
to
have
be
murder
,
and
that
in
such
a
villanous
manner
;
and
that
they
do
nothing
but
what
be
just
,
and
that
the
law
of
God
allow
to
be
do
to
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
one
would
think
this
should
have
be
enough
to
have
warn
us
against
go
on
shore
among
heathen
and
barbarian
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
make
mankind
wise
but
<EOS>
at
their
own
experience
;
and
their
experience
seem
to
be
always
of
most
use
to
them
when
it
be
dearest
buy
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
bind
to
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
and
from
thence
to
the
coast
of
Coromandel
,
only
to
touch
at
Surat
;
but
the
chief
of
the
supercargo
's
design
lie
at
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
where
if
he
miss
of
the
business
outward
-
bind
he
be
to
go
up
to
China
,
and
return
to
the
coast
as
he
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
disaster
that
befel
us
be
in
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
where
five
of
our
man
venture
on
shore
on
the
arabian
side
of
the
Gulf
be
surround
by
the
Arabs
,
and
either
all
kill
or
carry
away
into
slavery
;
the
rest
of
the
boat
's
crew
be
not
able
to
rescue
them
,
and
have
but
just
time
to
get
off
their
boat
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
upbraid
them
with
the
just
retribution
of
Heaven
in
this
case
;
but
the
boatswain
very
warmly
tell
me
,
he
think
I
go
farther
in
my
censure
than
I
could
show
any
warrant
for
in
scripture
,
and
refer
to
the
thirteenth
of
St.
Luke
,
ver
.
4
,
where
our
saviour
intimate
that
those
man
on
whom
the
tower
of
Siloam
fall
,
be
not
sinner
above
all
the
Galileans
;
but
that
which
indeed
put
me
to
silence
in
this
case
be
,
that
none
of
these
five
man
who
be
now
lose
be
of
the
number
of
those
who
go
on
shore
to
the
massacre
of
Madagascar
(
so
I
always
call
it
,
though
our
man
could
not
bear
the
word
massacre
with
any
patience
:
)
<EOS>
and
indeed
this
last
circumstance
,
as
I
have
say
,
put
me
to
silence
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
frequent
preach
to
them
on
this
subject
have
bad
consequence
than
I
expect
;
and
the
boatswain
,
who
have
be
the
head
of
the
attempt
,
come
up
boldly
to
me
one
time
,
and
tell
me
he
find
that
I
continually
bring
that
affair
upon
the
stage
,
that
I
make
unjust
reflection
upon
it
,
and
have
use
the
man
very
ill
on
that
account
,
and
himself
in
particular
;
that
as
I
be
but
a
passenger
,
and
have
no
command
in
the
ship
,
or
concern
in
the
voyage
,
they
be
not
oblige
to
bear
it
;
that
they
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
some
ill
design
in
my
head
,
and
perhaps
call
them
to
an
account
for
it
when
they
come
to
England
;
and
that
therefore
,
unless
I
would
resolve
to
have
do
with
it
,
and
also
not
to
concern
myself
farther
with
him
,
or
any
of
his
affair
,
he
would
leave
the
ship
;
for
he
do
not
think
it
be
safe
to
sail
with
me
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
him
patiently
enough
till
he
have
do
,
and
then
tell
him
that
I
do
confess
<EOS>
I
have
all
along
oppose
the
massacre
of
Madagascar
,
for
such
I
would
always
call
it
;
and
that
I
have
on
all
occasion
speak
my
mind
freely
about
it
,
though
not
more
upon
him
than
any
of
the
rest
;
that
as
to
my
have
no
command
in
the
ship
,
that
be
true
,
nor
do
I
exercise
any
authority
,
only
take
the
liberty
of
speak
my
mind
in
thing
which
publicly
concern
us
all
:
<EOS>
as
to
what
concern
I
have
in
the
voyage
,
that
be
none
of
his
business
;
I
be
a
considerable
owner
of
the
ship
,
and
in
that
claim
I
conceive
I
have
a
right
to
speak
,
even
farther
than
I
have
yet
do
,
and
would
not
be
accountable
to
him
or
any
one
else
;
and
begin
to
be
a
little
warm
with
him
:
he
make
but
little
reply
to
me
at
that
time
,
and
I
think
that
affair
have
be
over
.
<EOS>
We
be
at
this
time
in
the
road
to
Bengal
;
and
be
willing
to
see
the
place
,
I
go
on
shore
with
the
supercargo
,
in
the
ship
's
boat
,
to
divert
myself
;
and
towards
evening
be
prepare
to
go
on
board
,
when
one
of
the
man
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
he
would
not
have
me
trouble
myself
to
come
down
to
the
boat
,
for
they
have
order
not
to
carry
me
on
board
.
<EOS>
any
one
may
guess
what
a
surprise
I
be
in
at
so
insolent
a
message
;
and
I
ask
the
man
who
bid
him
deliver
that
errand
to
me
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
the
coxswain
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
to
the
fellow
,
but
bid
him
let
them
know
he
have
deliver
his
message
,
and
that
I
have
give
him
no
answer
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
immediately
go
and
round
out
the
supercargo
,
and
tell
him
the
story
,
add
,
what
I
presently
foresaw
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
there
would
certainly
be
a
mutiny
in
the
ship
;
and
entreat
him
to
go
immediately
on
board
the
ship
in
an
indian
boat
,
and
acquaint
the
captain
of
it
:
but
I
may
have
spare
this
intelligence
,
for
before
I
have
speak
to
him
on
shore
<EOS>
the
matter
be
effect
on
board
:
<EOS>
the
boatswain
,
the
gunner
,
the
carpenter
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
the
inferior
officer
,
as
soon
as
I
be
go
off
in
the
boat
,
come
up
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
and
desire
to
speak
with
the
captain
;
and
there
the
boatswain
make
a
long
harangue
,
(
for
the
fellow
talk
very
well
)
and
repeat
all
he
have
say
to
me
,
tell
the
captain
in
a
few
word
,
that
as
I
be
now
go
peaceably
on
shore
,
they
be
loath
to
use
any
violence
with
me
;
which
if
I
have
not
go
on
shore
,
they
would
otherwise
have
do
,
to
oblige
me
to
have
go
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
think
fit
to
tell
him
,
that
as
they
ship
themselves
to
serve
in
the
ship
under
his
command
,
they
would
perform
it
faithfully
;
but
if
I
would
not
quit
the
ship
,
or
the
captain
oblige
me
to
quit
it
,
they
would
all
leave
the
ship
,
and
sail
no
farther
with
him
;
and
at
that
word
all
,
he
turn
his
face
about
towards
the
main
-
mast
,
which
be
,
it
seem
,
the
signal
agree
on
between
them
,
at
which
all
the
seaman
be
get
together
,
they
cry
out
,
"
one
and
all
,
one
and
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
the
captain
,
be
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
of
great
presence
of
mind
;
and
though
he
be
surprised
,
you
may
be
sure
,
at
the
thing
,
yet
he
tell
them
calmly
he
would
consider
of
the
matter
,
but
that
he
could
do
nothing
in
it
till
he
have
speak
to
me
about
it
:
he
use
some
argument
with
them
,
to
shew
them
the
unreasonableness
and
injustice
of
the
thing
,
but
it
be
all
in
vain
;
they
swear
,
and
shake
hand
round
,
before
his
face
,
that
they
would
go
all
on
shore
unless
he
would
engage
to
them
not
to
suffer
me
to
come
on
board
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
hard
article
upon
him
,
who
know
his
obligation
to
me
,
and
do
not
know
how
I
may
take
it
;
so
he
begin
to
talk
cavalierly
to
them
;
tell
them
that
I
be
a
very
considerable
owner
of
the
ship
,
and
that
in
justice
he
could
not
put
me
out
of
my
own
house
;
that
this
be
next
door
to
serve
me
as
the
famous
pirate
Kid
have
do
,
who
make
the
mutiny
in
the
ship
,
set
the
captain
on
shore
in
an
uninhabited
island
,
and
run
away
with
the
ship
;
that
let
them
go
into
what
ship
they
would
,
if
ever
they
come
to
England
again
it
would
cost
them
dear
;
that
the
ship
be
mine
,
and
that
he
would
not
put
me
out
of
it
;
and
that
he
would
rather
lose
the
ship
,
and
the
voyage
too
,
than
disoblige
me
so
much
;
so
they
may
do
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
would
go
on
shore
,
and
talk
with
me
there
,
and
invite
the
boatswain
to
go
with
him
,
and
perhaps
they
may
accommodate
the
matter
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
all
reject
the
proposal
;
and
say
,
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
any
more
,
neither
on
board
nor
on
shore
;
<EOS>
and
if
I
come
on
board
,
they
would
go
on
shore
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
if
you
be
all
of
this
mind
,
let
me
go
on
shore
,
and
talk
with
him
:
<EOS>
"
so
away
he
come
to
me
with
this
account
,
a
little
after
the
message
have
be
bring
to
me
from
the
coxswain
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
to
see
my
nephew
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
for
I
be
not
without
apprehension
that
they
would
confine
him
by
violence
,
set
sail
,
and
run
away
with
the
ship
;
and
then
I
have
be
strip
naked
,
in
a
remote
country
,
and
nothing
to
help
myself
:
in
short
,
I
have
be
in
a
bad
case
than
when
I
be
all
alone
in
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
have
not
come
to
that
length
,
it
seem
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
;
and
when
my
nephew
tell
me
what
they
have
say
to
him
,
and
how
they
have
swear
,
and
shake
hand
,
that
they
would
one
and
all
leave
the
ship
,
<EOS>
if
I
be
suffer
to
come
on
board
,
I
tell
him
he
should
not
be
concern
at
it
at
all
,
for
I
would
stay
onshore
;
I
only
desire
he
would
take
care
and
send
me
all
my
necessary
thing
on
shore
,
and
leave
me
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
,
and
I
would
find
my
way
to
England
as
well
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
heavy
piece
of
news
to
my
nephew
;
but
there
be
no
way
to
help
it
,
but
to
comply
with
it
.
<EOS>
so
,
in
short
,
he
go
on
board
the
ship
again
,
and
satisfy
the
man
that
his
uncle
have
yield
to
their
importunity
,
and
have
send
for
his
good
from
on
board
the
ship
.
<EOS>
so
the
matter
be
over
in
a
very
few
hour
;
the
man
return
to
their
duty
,
and
I
begin
to
consider
what
course
I
should
steer
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
alone
in
the
remote
part
of
the
world
,
as
I
think
I
may
call
it
,
for
I
be
near
three
thousand
league
,
by
sea
,
farther
off
from
England
than
I
be
at
my
island
;
only
,
it
be
true
,
I
may
travel
here
by
land
,
over
the
Great
Mogul
's
country
to
Surat
,
may
go
from
thence
to
Bassora
by
sea
,
up
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
and
from
thence
may
take
the
way
of
the
caravans
,
over
the
desert
of
Arabia
,
to
Aleppo
and
Scanderoon
,
and
from
thence
by
sea
again
to
Italy
,
and
so
overland
into
France
;
and
this
,
put
together
,
may
be
,
at
least
,
a
full
diameter
of
the
globe
;
but
,
if
it
be
to
be
measure
,
I
suppose
it
would
appear
to
be
a
great
deal
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
another
way
before
me
,
which
be
to
wait
for
some
english
ship
,
which
be
come
to
Bengal
,
from
Achin
,
on
the
island
of
Sumatra
,
and
get
passage
on
board
them
for
England
:
<EOS>
but
as
I
come
hither
without
any
concern
with
the
English
East
India
Company
,
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
go
from
hence
without
their
licence
,
unless
with
great
favour
of
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
or
of
the
company
's
factor
;
and
to
both
I
be
an
utter
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
have
the
particular
pleasure
,
speak
by
contrariety
,
to
see
the
ship
set
sail
without
me
;
a
treatment
,
I
think
,
a
man
in
my
circumstance
scarce
ever
meet
with
,
except
from
pirate
run
away
with
a
ship
,
and
set
those
that
would
not
agree
with
their
villany
on
shore
:
indeed
this
be
the
next
door
to
it
both
way
.
<EOS>
however
,
my
nephew
leave
me
two
servant
,
or
rather
,
one
companion
and
one
servant
:
the
first
be
clerk
to
the
purser
,
whom
he
engage
to
go
with
me
;
and
the
other
be
his
own
servant
.
<EOS>
I
take
me
also
a
good
lodging
in
the
house
of
an
english
woman
,
where
several
merchant
lodge
,
some
French
,
two
Italians
,
or
rather
Jews
,
and
one
Englishman
.
<EOS>
here
I
be
handsomely
enough
entertain
;
and
that
I
may
not
be
say
to
run
rashly
upon
any
thing
,
I
stay
here
above
nine
month
,
consider
what
course
to
take
,
and
how
to
manage
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
english
good
with
me
of
value
,
and
a
considerable
sum
of
money
;
my
nephew
furnish
me
with
a
thousand
piece
of
eight
,
and
a
letter
of
credit
for
more
,
if
I
have
occasion
,
that
I
may
not
be
straiten
,
whatever
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
I
quickly
dispose
of
my
good
,
and
to
advantage
too
;
and
,
as
I
originally
intend
,
I
buy
here
some
very
good
diamond
,
which
,
of
all
other
thing
,
be
the
most
proper
for
me
,
in
my
circumstance
,
because
I
may
always
carry
my
whole
estate
about
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
long
stay
here
,
and
many
proposal
make
for
my
return
to
England
,
but
none
fall
to
my
mind
,
the
english
merchant
,
who
lodge
with
me
,
and
with
whom
I
have
contract
an
intimate
acquaintance
,
come
to
me
one
morning
:
"
Countryman
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
a
project
to
communicate
to
you
,
which
,
as
it
suit
with
my
thought
,
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
suit
with
yours
also
,
when
you
shall
have
thoroughly
consider
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
we
be
post
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
by
accident
,
and
I
by
my
own
choice
,
in
a
part
of
the
world
very
remote
from
our
own
country
;
but
it
be
in
a
country
where
,
by
us
who
understand
trade
and
business
,
a
great
deal
of
money
be
to
be
get
:
if
you
will
put
a
thousand
pound
to
my
thousand
pound
,
we
will
hire
a
ship
here
,
the
first
we
can
get
to
our
mind
;
you
shall
be
captain
,
I
will
be
merchant
,
and
we
will
go
a
trading
voyage
to
China
;
for
what
should
we
stand
still
for
?
<EOS>
the
whole
world
be
in
motion
,
roll
round
and
round
;
all
the
creature
of
God
,
heavenly
body
and
earthly
,
be
busy
and
vibrant
:
why
should
we
be
idle
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
drone
,
"
say
he
,
"
live
in
the
world
<EOS>
but
man
<EOS>
:
why
should
we
be
of
that
number
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
like
this
proposal
very
well
;
and
the
more
because
it
seem
to
be
express
with
so
much
good
will
,
and
in
so
friendly
a
manner
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
but
that
I
may
,
by
my
loose
and
unhinged
circumstance
,
be
the
fitter
to
embrace
a
proposal
for
trade
,
and
indeed
for
any
thing
else
;
or
otherwise
trade
be
none
of
my
element
;
however
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
say
with
some
truth
,
that
if
trade
be
not
my
element
,
rambling
be
;
and
no
proposal
for
see
any
part
of
the
world
,
which
I
have
never
see
before
,
could
possibly
come
amiss
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
some
time
before
we
could
get
a
ship
to
our
mind
;
and
when
we
get
a
vessel
,
it
be
not
easy
to
get
english
sailor
;
that
be
to
say
,
so
many
as
be
necessary
to
govern
the
voyage
,
and
manage
the
sailor
which
we
should
pick
up
there
.
<EOS>
after
some
time
we
get
a
mate
,
a
boatswain
,
and
a
gunner
,
English
;
a
dutch
carpenter
,
and
three
portuguese
foremast
-
man
:
<EOS>
with
these
we
find
we
could
do
well
enough
,
have
indian
seaman
,
such
as
they
be
,
to
make
up
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
traveller
who
have
write
the
history
of
their
voyage
and
travel
this
way
,
that
it
would
be
but
very
little
diversion
to
any
body
,
to
give
a
long
account
of
the
place
we
go
to
,
and
the
people
who
inhabit
there
:
those
thing
I
leave
to
other
,
and
refer
the
reader
to
those
journal
and
travel
of
englishman
,
many
of
which
,
I
find
,
be
publish
,
and
more
promise
every
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
that
we
make
the
voyage
to
Achin
,
in
the
island
of
Sumatra
,
first
;
and
from
thence
to
Siam
,
where
we
exchange
some
of
our
ware
for
opium
,
and
for
some
arrack
;
the
first
a
commodity
which
bear
a
great
price
among
the
Chinese
,
and
which
,
at
that
time
,
be
very
much
want
there
:
in
a
word
,
we
go
up
to
Susham
;
make
a
very
great
voyage
;
be
eight
month
out
;
and
return
to
Bengal
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
very
well
satisfied
with
my
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
,
that
our
people
in
England
often
admire
how
the
officer
,
which
the
company
send
into
India
,
and
the
merchant
which
generally
stay
there
,
get
such
very
good
estate
as
they
do
,
and
sometimes
come
home
worth
sixty
,
seventy
,
and
<EOS>
a
hundred
thousand
pound
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
no
wonder
,
or
,
at
least
,
we
shall
see
so
much
farther
into
it
,
when
we
consider
the
innumerable
port
and
place
where
they
have
a
free
commerce
,
that
it
will
then
be
no
wonder
;
and
much
less
will
it
be
so
,
when
we
consider
,
that
at
all
those
place
and
port
where
the
english
ship
come
,
there
be
so
much
,
and
such
constant
demand
for
the
growth
of
all
other
country
,
that
there
be
a
certain
vent
for
the
return
,
as
well
as
a
market
abroad
for
the
good
carry
out
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
make
a
very
good
voyage
,
and
I
get
so
much
money
by
the
first
adventure
,
and
such
an
insight
into
the
method
of
get
more
,
<EOS>
that
,
have
I
be
twenty
year
young
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
tempt
to
have
stay
here
,
and
seek
no
farther
for
make
my
fortune
:
<EOS>
but
what
be
all
this
to
a
man
on
the
wrong
side
of
threescore
,
that
be
rich
enough
,
and
come
abroad
more
in
obedience
to
a
restless
desire
of
see
the
world
,
than
a
covetous
desire
of
get
in
it
?
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
think
it
be
with
great
justice
that
I
now
call
it
a
restless
desire
,
for
it
be
so
<EOS>
:
when
I
be
at
home
,
I
be
restless
to
go
abroad
;
and
now
I
be
abroad
,
<EOS>
I
be
restless
to
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
what
be
this
gain
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
be
rich
enough
already
;
nor
have
I
any
uneasy
desire
about
get
more
money
;
and
therefore
,
the
profit
of
the
voyage
to
me
be
thing
of
no
great
force
to
me
,
for
the
prompting
me
forward
to
farther
undertaking
<EOS>
:
hence
I
think
,
that
by
this
voyage
I
have
make
no
progress
at
all
;
because
I
be
come
back
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
to
the
place
from
whence
<EOS>
I
come
,
as
to
a
home
;
whereas
my
eye
,
which
,
like
that
which
Solomon
speak
of
,
be
never
satisfied
with
seeing
,
be
still
more
desirous
of
wander
and
see
.
<EOS>
I
be
come
into
a
part
of
the
world
which
I
never
be
in
before
;
and
that
part
in
particular
which
I
have
hear
much
of
;
and
be
resolve
to
see
as
much
of
it
as
I
could
;
and
<EOS>
then
I
think
I
may
say
I
have
see
all
the
world
that
be
worth
see
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
fellow
-
traveller
and
<EOS>
I
have
different
notion
<EOS>
:
I
do
not
name
this
to
insist
upon
my
own
,
for
I
acknowledge
his
be
most
just
,
and
the
most
suited
to
the
end
of
a
merchant
's
life
;
who
,
when
he
be
abroad
upon
adventure
,
it
be
his
wisdom
to
stick
to
that
,
as
the
good
thing
for
him
,
which
he
be
like
to
get
the
most
money
by
.
<EOS>
My
new
friend
keep
himself
to
the
nature
of
the
thing
,
and
would
have
be
content
to
have
go
,
like
a
carrier
's
horse
,
always
to
the
same
inn
,
backward
and
forward
,
provide
he
could
,
as
he
call
it
,
find
his
account
in
it
:
on
the
other
hand
,
mine
,
as
old
as
I
be
,
be
the
notion
of
a
mad
rambling
boy
,
that
never
care
to
see
a
thing
twice
over
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
:
I
have
a
kind
of
impatience
upon
me
to
be
nearer
home
,
and
yet
the
most
unsettled
resolution
imaginable
,
which
way
to
go
.
<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
these
consultation
,
my
friend
,
who
be
always
upon
the
search
for
business
,
propose
another
voyage
to
me
,
viz
.
<EOS>
among
the
Spice
Islands
;
and
to
bring
home
a
load
of
clove
from
the
Manillas
,
or
thereabout
;
place
where
,
indeed
,
the
Dutch
do
trade
,
but
the
island
belong
partly
to
the
Spaniards
;
though
we
go
not
so
far
,
but
to
some
other
,
where
they
have
not
the
whole
power
as
they
have
at
Batavia
,
Ceylon
,
&
c.
<EOS>
We
be
not
long
in
prepare
for
this
voyage
;
the
chief
difficulty
be
in
bring
me
to
come
into
it
;
however
,
at
last
,
nothing
else
offer
,
and
find
that
really
stir
about
and
trading
,
the
profit
be
so
great
,
and
,
as
I
may
say
,
certain
,
have
more
pleasure
in
it
,
and
more
satisfaction
to
the
mind
,
than
sit
still
;
<EOS>
which
,
to
me
especially
,
be
the
unhappy
part
of
life
,
I
resolve
on
this
voyage
too
:
<EOS>
which
we
make
very
successfully
,
touch
at
Borneo
,
and
several
island
,
whose
name
I
do
not
remember
,
and
come
home
in
about
five
month
.
<EOS>
We
sell
our
spice
,
which
be
chiefly
clove
,
and
some
nutmeg
,
to
the
persian
merchant
,
who
carry
them
away
for
the
Gulf
;
and
,
make
near
five
of
one
,
we
really
get
a
great
deal
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
My
friend
,
when
we
make
up
this
account
,
smile
at
me
:
"
well
now
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
sort
of
an
agreeable
insult
upon
my
indolent
temper
,
"
be
not
this
well
than
walk
about
here
,
like
a
man
of
nothing
to
do
,
and
spend
our
time
in
stare
at
the
nonsense
and
ignorace
of
the
Pagans
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
truly
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
my
friend
,
I
think
it
be
;
and
I
begin
to
be
a
convert
to
the
principle
of
merchandising
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
tell
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
by
the
way
,
you
do
not
know
what
I
be
do
;
for
if
once
I
conquer
my
backwardness
,
and
embark
heartily
,
as
old
as
I
be
,
I
shall
harass
you
up
and
down
the
world
till
I
tire
you
;
for
I
shall
pursue
it
so
eagerly
<EOS>
,
I
shall
never
let
you
lie
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
to
be
short
with
my
speculation
:
a
little
while
after
this
there
come
in
a
dutch
ship
from
Batavia
;
she
be
a
coaster
,
not
an
european
trader
,
and
of
about
two
hundred
ton
burden
:
<EOS>
the
man
,
as
they
pretend
,
have
be
so
sickly
,
that
the
captain
have
not
man
enough
to
go
to
sea
with
,
he
lie
by
at
Bengal
;
and
,
as
if
have
get
money
enough
,
or
be
willing
,
for
other
reason
,
to
go
for
Europe
,
he
give
public
notice
,
that
he
would
sell
his
ship
;
this
come
to
my
ear
before
my
new
partner
hear
of
it
;
and
I
have
a
great
mind
to
buy
it
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
home
to
him
,
and
tell
him
of
it
:
he
consider
awhile
,
for
he
be
no
rash
man
neither
;
but
muse
some
time
,
he
reply
,
"
She
be
a
little
too
big
;
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
we
will
have
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
accordingly
we
buy
the
ship
;
and
,
agree
with
the
master
,
we
pay
for
her
,
and
take
possession
;
when
we
have
do
so
,
we
resolve
to
entertain
the
man
,
if
we
could
,
to
join
them
with
those
we
have
,
for
the
pursue
our
business
;
but
on
a
sudden
,
they
not
have
receive
their
wage
,
but
their
share
of
the
money
,
as
we
afterwards
learn
,
not
one
of
them
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
We
inquire
much
about
them
,
and
at
length
be
tell
,
that
they
be
all
go
together
,
by
land
,
to
Agra
,
the
great
city
of
the
Mogul
's
residence
;
and
from
thence
be
to
travel
to
Surat
,
and
so
by
sea
to
the
Gulf
of
Persia
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
so
heartily
trouble
me
a
good
while
,
as
that
I
miss
the
opportunity
of
go
with
them
;
for
such
a
ramble
,
I
think
,
and
in
such
company
as
would
both
have
guard
me
and
divert
me
,
would
have
suit
mightily
with
my
great
design
;
and
I
should
both
have
see
the
world
,
and
go
homeward
too
;
but
I
be
much
better
satisfy
a
few
day
after
,
when
I
come
to
know
what
sort
of
fellow
they
be
;
for
,
in
short
,
their
history
be
,
that
this
man
they
call
captain
be
the
gunner
only
,
not
the
commander
;
that
they
have
be
a
trading
voyage
,
in
which
they
be
attack
on
shore
by
some
of
the
Malaccans
,
who
have
kill
the
captain
and
three
of
his
man
;
and
that
after
the
captain
be
kill
,
these
man
,
eleven
in
number
,
have
resolve
to
run
away
with
the
ship
,
which
they
do
;
and
have
bring
her
in
at
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
leave
the
mate
and
five
man
more
on
shore
;
of
whom
we
shall
hear
farther
.
  
<EOS>
well
;
let
them
come
by
the
ship
how
they
would
,
we
come
honestly
by
her
,
as
we
think
;
though
we
do
not
,
I
confess
,
examine
into
thing
so
exactly
as
we
ought
;
for
we
never
inquire
any
thing
of
the
seaman
,
who
,
if
we
have
examine
,
would
certainly
have
falter
in
their
account
,
contradict
one
another
,
and
perhaps
have
contradict
themselves
;
or
,
one
how
or
other
,
we
should
have
see
reason
to
have
suspect
them
:
but
the
man
shew
us
a
bill
of
sale
for
the
ship
,
to
one
Emanuel
Clostershoven
,
or
some
such
name
,
(
for
I
suppose
it
be
all
a
forgery
)
and
call
himself
by
that
name
;
and
we
could
not
contradict
him
;
and
be
withal
a
little
too
unwary
,
or
at
least
have
no
suspicion
of
the
thing
,
we
go
through
with
our
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
we
pick
up
some
english
seaman
here
after
this
,
and
some
Dutch
;
and
we
now
resolve
for
a
second
voyage
to
the
south
-
east
,
for
clove
,
&
c.
that
be
to
say
,
among
the
philippine
and
Malacca
isle
;
and
,
in
short
,
not
to
fill
this
part
of
my
story
with
trifle
,
when
what
be
yet
to
come
be
so
remarkable
,
I
spend
,
from
first
to
last
,
six
year
in
this
country
,
trade
from
port
to
port
,
backward
and
forward
,
and
with
very
good
success
;
and
be
now
the
last
year
with
my
partner
,
go
in
the
ship
above
-
mention
,
on
a
voyage
to
China
;
but
design
first
to
go
to
Siam
,
to
buy
rice
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
voyage
,
be
by
contrary
wind
oblige
to
beat
up
and
down
a
great
while
in
the
Straits
of
Malacca
,
and
among
the
island
,
we
be
no
sooner
get
clear
of
those
difficult
sea
,
but
we
find
our
ship
have
spring
a
leak
,
and
we
be
not
able
,
by
all
our
industry
,
to
find
out
where
it
be
.
<EOS>
this
force
us
to
make
for
some
port
;
and
my
partner
,
who
know
the
country
better
than
I
do
,
direct
the
captain
to
put
into
the
river
of
Cambodia
;
for
I
have
make
the
english
mate
,
one
Mr.
Thompson
,
captain
,
not
be
willing
to
take
the
charge
of
the
ship
upon
myself
.
<EOS>
this
river
lie
on
the
north
side
of
the
great
bay
or
gulf
which
go
up
to
Siam
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
here
,
and
go
often
on
shore
for
refreshment
,
there
come
to
me
one
day
an
Englishman
,
and
he
be
,
it
seem
,
a
gunner
's
mate
on
board
an
English
East
India
ship
,
which
ride
in
the
same
river
,
up
at
or
near
the
city
of
Cambodia
:
<EOS>
what
bring
him
hither
<EOS>
we
know
not
;
but
he
come
up
to
me
,
and
,
speak
English
,
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
you
be
a
stranger
to
me
,
and
I
to
you
;
but
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
that
very
nearly
concern
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
stedfastly
at
him
a
good
while
,
and
he
think
at
first
I
have
know
him
,
but
I
do
not
.
"
<EOS>
if
it
very
nearly
concern
me
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
not
yourself
,
what
move
you
to
tell
it
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
move
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
the
imminent
danger
you
be
in
;
and
,
for
aught
I
see
,
you
have
no
knowledge
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
danger
I
be
in
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
that
my
ship
be
leaky
,
and
I
can
not
find
it
out
;
but
I
propose
to
lay
her
aground
to
-
morrow
,
to
see
if
I
can
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
leaky
or
not
leaky
,
find
it
or
not
find
it
,
you
will
be
wise
than
to
lay
your
ship
on
shore
to
-
morrow
,
when
you
hear
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
town
of
Cambodia
lie
about
fifteen
league
up
this
river
?
<EOS>
and
there
be
two
large
english
ship
about
five
league
on
this
side
,
and
three
Dutch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
what
be
that
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
it
for
a
man
that
be
upon
such
adventure
as
you
be
,
to
come
into
a
port
,
and
not
examine
first
what
ship
there
be
there
,
and
whether
he
be
able
to
deal
with
them
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
not
think
you
be
a
match
for
them
?
<EOS>
"
I
be
amuse
very
much
at
his
discourse
,
but
not
amazed
at
it
;
for
I
could
not
conceive
what
he
mean
;
and
I
turn
short
upon
him
,
and
say
,
"
Sir
,
I
wish
you
would
explain
yourself
;
I
can
not
imagine
what
reason
I
have
to
be
afraid
of
any
of
the
company
's
ship
,
or
dutch
ship
;
I
be
no
interloper
;
what
can
they
have
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
like
a
man
half
angry
,
half
pleased
;
and
pause
awhile
,
but
smile
,
"
<EOS>
well
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
think
yourself
secure
,
you
must
take
your
chance
;
I
be
sorry
your
fate
should
blind
you
against
good
advice
;
but
assure
yourself
if
you
do
not
put
to
sea
immediately
,
you
will
the
very
next
tide
be
attack
by
five
long
-
boat
full
of
man
;
and
,
perhaps
,
if
you
be
take
,
you
will
be
hang
for
a
pirate
,
and
the
particular
be
examine
into
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Sir
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
should
have
meet
with
a
well
reception
than
this
,
for
do
you
a
piece
of
service
of
such
importance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
be
ungrateful
,
"
say
I
,
"
for
any
service
,
or
to
any
man
that
offer
me
any
kindness
;
but
it
be
past
my
comprehension
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
they
should
have
such
a
design
upon
me
for
;
however
,
since
you
say
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
,
and
that
there
be
some
villanous
design
in
hand
against
me
,
I
will
go
on
board
this
minute
,
and
put
to
sea
immediately
,
if
my
man
can
stop
the
leak
,
or
if
we
can
swim
without
stop
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
shall
I
go
away
ignorant
of
the
reason
of
all
this
?
<EOS>
Can
you
give
me
no
farther
light
into
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
but
<EOS>
part
of
the
story
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
I
have
a
dutch
seaman
here
with
me
,
and
,
I
believe
,
I
could
persuade
him
to
tell
you
the
rest
;
but
there
be
scarce
time
for
it
:
but
the
short
of
the
story
be
this
,
the
first
part
of
which
,
I
suppose
,
you
know
well
enough
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
you
be
with
this
ship
at
Sumatra
;
that
there
your
captain
be
murder
by
the
Malaccans
,
with
three
of
his
man
;
and
that
you
,
or
some
of
those
that
be
on
board
with
you
,
run
away
with
the
ship
,
and
be
since
turn
pirate
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
sum
of
the
story
,
and
you
will
all
be
seize
as
pirate
,
I
can
assure
you
,
and
execute
with
very
little
ceremony
;
for
you
know
merchant
-
ship
shew
but
little
law
to
pirate
,
if
they
get
them
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
you
speak
plain
English
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
I
thank
you
;
and
though
I
know
nothing
that
we
have
do
,
like
what
you
talk
of
,
but
I
be
sure
we
come
honestly
and
fairly
by
the
ship
;
yet
see
such
work
be
a
-
doing
,
as
you
say
,
and
that
you
seem
to
mean
honestly
<EOS>
,
I
will
be
upon
my
guard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
talk
of
be
upon
your
guard
;
the
good
defence
be
to
be
out
of
the
danger
:
if
you
have
any
regard
to
your
life
,
and
the
life
of
all
your
man
,
put
out
to
sea
without
fail
at
high
-
water
;
and
as
you
have
a
whole
tide
before
you
,
you
will
be
go
too
far
out
before
they
can
come
down
;
for
they
will
come
away
at
high
water
;
and
as
they
have
twenty
mile
to
come
,
you
will
get
near
two
hour
of
them
by
the
difference
of
the
tide
,
not
reckon
the
length
of
the
way
:
besides
,
as
they
be
only
boat
,
and
not
ship
,
they
will
not
venture
to
follow
you
far
out
to
sea
,
especially
if
it
blow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
have
be
very
kind
in
this
:
what
shall
I
do
for
you
to
make
you
amend
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
may
not
be
so
willing
to
make
me
amend
,
because
you
may
not
be
convince
of
the
truth
of
it
:
I
will
make
an
offer
to
you
;
I
have
nineteen
month
pay
due
to
me
on
board
the
ship
#
#
#
#
,
 
which
I
come
out
of
England
in
;
and
the
Dutchman
,
that
be
with
me
,
have
seven
month
pay
due
to
him
;
if
you
will
make
good
our
pay
to
us
,
we
will
go
along
with
you
:
<EOS>
if
you
find
nothing
more
in
it
,
we
will
desire
no
more
;
but
if
we
do
convince
you
,
that
we
have
save
your
life
,
and
the
ship
,
and
the
life
of
all
the
man
in
her
,
we
will
leave
the
rest
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
consent
to
this
readily
;
and
go
immediately
on
board
,
and
the
two
man
with
me
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
come
to
the
ship
's
side
,
my
partner
,
who
be
on
board
,
come
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
and
call
to
me
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
,
"
o
ho
!
<EOS>
o
ho
!
<EOS>
we
have
stop
the
leak
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
say
you
so
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
;
"
thank
God
;
but
weigh
the
anchor
then
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Weigh
!

say
he
;
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ask
no
question
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
all
hand
to
work
,
and
weigh
without
lose
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
surprised
:
but
,
however
,
he
call
the
captain
,
and
he
immediately
order
the
anchor
to
be
get
up
;
and
though
the
tide
be
not
quite
do
,
yet
a
little
land
breeze
blowing
,
we
stand
out
to
sea
;
then
I
call
him
into
the
cabin
,
and
tell
him
the
story
at
large
;
and
we
call
in
the
man
,
and
they
tell
us
the
rest
of
it
:
but
as
it
take
us
up
a
great
deal
of
time
,
so
before
we
have
do
,
a
seaman
come
to
the
cabin
door
,
and
call
out
to
us
,
that
the
captain
make
him
tell
us
,
we
be
chase
.
<EOS>
"
chase
!
"
say
I
;
"
by
whom
,
and
by
what
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
five
sloop
,
or
boat
,

the
fellow
,
"
full
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
I
;
"
then
it
be
apparent
there
be
something
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
I
order
all
our
man
to
be
call
up
;
and
tell
them
,
that
there
be
a
design
to
seize
the
ship
,
and
to
take
us
for
pirate
;
and
ask
them
,
if
they
would
stand
by
us
,
and
by
one
another
?
<EOS>
the
man
answer
,
cheerfully
,
one
and
all
,
that
they
would
live
and
die
with
us
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
the
captain
,
what
way
he
think
best
for
us
to
manage
a
fight
with
them
;
for
resist
them
<EOS>
I
resolve
we
would
,
and
that
to
the
last
drop
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
readily
,
that
the
way
be
to
keep
them
off
with
our
great
shot
,
as
long
as
we
could
,
and
then
to
fire
at
them
with
our
small
arm
,
to
keep
them
from
board
us
;
but
when
neither
of
these
would
do
any
longer
,
we
should
retire
to
our
close
quarter
;
perhaps
they
have
not
material
to
break
open
our
bulk
-
head
,
or
get
in
upon
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
gunner
have
,
in
the
mean
time
,
order
to
bring
two
gun
to
bear
fore
and
aft
,
out
of
the
steerage
,
to
clear
the
deck
,
and
load
them
with
musket
-
bullet
and
small
piece
of
old
iron
,
and
what
next
come
to
hand
;
and
thus
we
make
ready
for
fight
;
but
all
this
while
keep
out
to
sea
,
with
wind
enough
,
and
could
see
the
boat
at
a
distance
,
be
five
large
long
-
boat
follow
us
,
with
all
the
sail
they
could
make
.
  
<EOS>
two
of
these
boat
,
which
,
by
our
glass
,
we
could
see
be
English
,
have
outsail
the
rest
,
be
near
two
league
a
head
of
them
,
and
gain
upon
us
considerably
;
so
that
we
find
they
would
come
up
with
us
:
upon
which
we
fire
a
gun
without
a
shot
,
to
intimate
that
they
should
bring
to
;
and
we
put
out
a
flag
of
truce
,
as
a
signal
for
parley
;
but
they
keep
crowd
after
us
,
till
they
come
within
shot
:
upon
this
we
take
in
our
white
flag
,
they
have
make
no
answer
to
it
;
hang
out
the
red
flag
,
and
fire
at
them
with
shot
;
notwithstanding
this
,
they
come
on
till
they
be
near
enough
to
call
to
them
with
a
speaking
,
trumpet
,
which
we
have
on
board
;
so
we
call
to
them
,
and
bade
them
keep
off
at
their
peril
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
,
they
crowd
after
us
,
and
endeavour
to
come
under
our
stern
,
so
to
board
us
on
our
quarter
:
upon
which
,
see
they
be
resolute
for
mischief
,
and
depend
upon
the
strength
that
follow
them
,
I
order
to
bring
the
ship
to
,
so
that
they
lie
upon
our
broadside
,
when
immediately
we
fire
five
gun
at
them
;
one
of
them
have
be
level
so
true
,
as
to
carry
away
the
stern
of
the
hindermost
boat
,
and
bring
them
to
the
necessity
of
take
down
their
sail
,
and
run
all
to
the
head
of
the
boat
to
keep
her
from
sink
;
so
she
lie
by
,
and
have
enough
of
it
;
but
see
the
foremost
boat
still
crowd
on
after
us
,
we
make
ready
to
fire
at
her
in
particular
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
,
one
of
the
three
boat
that
be
behind
,
be
forwarder
than
the
other
two
,
make
up
to
the
boat
which
we
have
disable
,
to
relieve
her
,
and
we
could
afterwards
see
her
take
out
the
man
:
we
call
again
to
the
foremost
boat
,
and
offer
a
truce
to
parley
again
,
and
to
know
what
be
her
business
with
us
;
but
have
no
answer
:
<EOS>
only
she
crowd
close
under
our
stern
.
<EOS>
upon
this
our
gunner
,
who
be
a
very
dexterous
fellow
,
run
out
his
two
chase
-
gun
,
and
fire
at
her
;
but
the
shot
missing
,
the
man
in
the
boat
shout
,
wave
their
cap
,
and
come
on
;
but
the
gunner
,
get
quickly
ready
again
,
fire
among
them
a
second
time
;
one
shot
of
which
,
though
it
miss
the
boat
itself
,
yet
fall
in
among
the
man
,
and
we
could
easily
see
have
do
a
great
deal
of
mischief
among
them
;
but
<EOS>
we
,
take
no
notice
of
that
,
wear
the
ship
again
,
and
bring
our
quarter
to
bear
upon
them
;
and
,
fire
three
gun
more
,
we
find
the
boat
be
split
almost
to
piece
;
in
particular
,
her
rudder
,
and
a
piece
of
her
stern
,
be
shoot
quite
away
;
so
they
hand
their
sail
immediately
,
and
be
in
great
disorder
;
but
,
to
complete
their
misfortune
,
our
gunner
let
fly
two
gun
at
them
again
;
<EOS>
where
he
hit
them
we
could
not
tell
,
but
we
find
the
boat
be
sink
,
and
some
of
the
man
already
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
upon
this
I
immediately
man
out
our
pinnace
,
which
we
have
keep
close
by
our
side
,
with
order
to
pick
up
some
of
the
man
,
if
they
could
,
and
save
them
from
drown
,
and
immediately
to
come
on
board
with
them
;
because
we
see
the
rest
of
the
boat
begin
to
come
up
.
<EOS>
Our
man
in
the
pinnace
follow
their
order
,
and
take
up
three
man
;
one
of
which
be
just
drown
,
and
it
be
a
good
while
before
we
could
recover
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
on
board
,
we
crowd
all
the
sail
we
could
make
,
and
stand
farther
out
to
sea
;
and
we
find
,
that
when
the
other
three
boat
come
up
to
the
first
two
,
they
give
over
their
chase
.
  
<EOS>
be
thus
deliver
from
a
danger
,
which
though
I
know
not
the
reason
of
it
,
yet
seem
to
be
much
great
than
I
apprehend
,
I
take
care
that
we
should
change
our
course
,
and
not
let
any
one
imagine
whither
we
be
go
;
so
we
stand
out
to
sea
eastward
,
quite
out
of
the
course
of
all
european
ship
,
whether
they
be
bind
to
China
,
or
any
where
else
within
the
commerce
of
the
european
nation
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
now
at
sea
,
we
begin
to
consult
with
the
two
seaman
,
and
inquire
first
,
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
should
be
?
<EOS>
the
Dutchman
let
us
into
the
secret
of
it
at
once
;
tell
us
,
that
the
fellow
that
sell
us
the
ship
,
as
we
say
,
be
no
more
than
a
thief
that
have
run
away
with
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
tell
us
how
the
captain
,
whose
name
too
he
mention
,
though
I
do
not
remember
it
now
,
be
treacherously
murder
by
the
native
on
the
coast
of
Malacca
,
with
three
of
his
man
;
and
that
he
,
this
Dutchman
,
and
four
more
,
get
into
the
wood
,
where
they
wander
about
a
great
while
;
till
at
length
he
,
in
particular
,
in
a
miraculous
manner
,
make
his
escape
,
and
swam
off
to
a
dutch
ship
,
which
sail
near
the
shore
,
in
its
way
from
China
,
have
send
their
boat
on
shore
for
fresh
water
;
that
he
durst
not
come
to
that
part
of
the
shore
where
the
boat
be
,
but
make
shift
in
the
night
to
take
in
the
water
farther
off
,
and
swim
a
great
while
,
at
last
the
ship
's
boat
take
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
tell
us
,
that
he
go
to
Batavia
,
where
two
of
the
seaman
belong
to
the
ship
have
arrive
,
have
desert
the
rest
in
their
travel
;
and
give
an
account
,
that
the
fellow
who
have
run
away
with
the
ship
,
sell
her
at
Bengal
to
a
set
of
pirate
,
which
be
go
a
-
cruising
in
her
;
and
that
they
have
already
take
an
english
ship
,
and
two
dutch
ship
,
very
richly
laden
.
  
<EOS>
this
latter
part
we
find
to
concern
us
directly
;
and
though
we
know
it
to
be
false
,
yet
,
as
my
partner
say
very
well
,
if
we
have
fall
into
their
hand
,
and
they
have
such
a
prepossession
against
us
beforehand
,
it
have
be
in
vain
for
us
to
have
defend
ourselves
,
or
to
hope
for
any
good
quarter
at
their
hand
;
especially
consider
that
our
accuser
have
be
our
judge
,
and
that
we
could
have
expect
nothing
from
them
but
what
rage
would
have
dictate
,
and
ungoverned
passion
have
execute
;
and
therefore
it
be
his
opinion
<EOS>
,
we
should
go
directly
back
to
Bengal
,
from
whence
we
come
,
without
put
in
at
any
port
whatever
;
because
there
we
could
give
an
account
of
ourselves
,
and
could
prove
where
we
be
when
the
ship
put
in
,
whom
we
buy
her
of
,
and
the
like
;
and
,
which
be
more
than
all
the
rest
,
if
we
be
put
to
the
necessity
of
bring
it
before
the
proper
judge
,
we
should
be
sure
to
have
some
justice
;
and
not
be
hang
first
,
and
judge
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
some
time
of
my
partner
's
opinion
;
but
after
a
little
more
serious
thinking
,
I
tell
him
,
I
think
it
be
a
very
great
hazard
for
us
to
attempt
return
to
Bengal
,
for
that
we
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
Straits
of
Malacca
;
and
that
if
the
alarm
be
give
,
we
should
be
sure
to
be
waylay
on
every
side
,
as
well
by
the
Dutch
of
Batavia
,
as
the
English
elsewhere
;
that
if
we
should
be
take
,
as
it
be
,
run
away
,
we
should
even
condemn
ourselves
,
and
there
would
want
no
more
evidence
to
destroy
us
.
<EOS>
I
also
ask
the
English
sailor
's
opinion
,
who
say
,
he
be
of
my
mind
,
and
that
we
should
certainly
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
this
danger
a
little
startled
my
partner
,
and
all
the
ship
's
company
;
and
we
immediately
resolve
to
go
away
to
the
coast
of
Tonquin
,
and
so
on
to
China
;
and
from
thence
pursue
the
first
design
,
as
to
trade
,
find
some
way
or
other
to
dispose
of
the
ship
,
and
come
back
in
some
of
the
vessel
of
the
country
,
such
as
we
could
get
.
<EOS>
this
be
approve
of
as
the
good
method
for
our
security
;
and
accordingly
we
steer
away
<EOS>
N.N.E.
keep
above
fifty
league
off
from
the
usual
course
to
the
eastward
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
put
us
to
some
inconvenience
;
for
first
the
wind
when
we
come
to
that
distance
from
the
shore
,
seem
to
be
more
steadily
against
us
,
blow
almost
trade
as
we
call
it
,
from
the
E.
and
E.N.E.
;
so
that
we
be
a
long
while
upon
our
voyage
,
and
we
be
but
ill
provide
with
victual
for
so
long
a
run
;
and
,
which
be
still
bad
<EOS>
,
there
be
some
danger
that
those
english
and
dutch
ship
,
whose
boat
pursue
us
,
whereof
some
be
bind
that
way
,
may
be
get
in
before
us
;
and
if
not
,
some
other
ship
bind
to
China
may
have
information
of
us
from
them
,
and
pursue
us
with
the
same
vigour
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
confess
I
be
now
very
uneasy
,
and
think
myself
,
include
the
last
escape
from
the
long
boat
,
to
have
be
in
the
most
dangerous
condition
that
ever
I
be
in
through
all
my
past
life
;
for
whatever
ill
circumstance
I
have
be
in
,
I
be
never
pursue
for
a
thief
before
;
nor
have
I
ever
do
any
thing
that
merit
the
name
of
dishonest
or
fraudulent
,
much
less
thievish
.
<EOS>
I
have
chiefly
be
mine
own
enemy
;
or
,
as
I
may
rightly
say
,
I
have
be
nobody
's
enemy
but
my
own
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
be
embarrassed
in
the
bad
condition
imaginable
;
for
though
I
be
perfectly
innocent
,
I
be
in
no
condition
to
make
that
innocence
appear
:
and
if
I
have
be
take
,
it
have
be
under
a
suppose
guilt
of
the
bad
kind
;
at
least
a
crime
esteem
so
among
the
people
I
have
to
do
with
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
me
very
anxious
to
make
an
escape
,
though
which
way
to
do
it
<EOS>
I
know
not
;
or
what
port
or
place
we
should
go
to
.
<EOS>
My
partner
,
see
me
thus
deject
,
though
he
be
the
most
concerned
at
first
,
begin
to
encourage
me
;
and
describe
to
me
the
several
port
of
the
coast
,
tell
me
,
he
would
put
in
on
the
coast
of
Cochinchina
,
or
the
bay
of
Tonquin
;
intend
to
go
afterwards
to
Macao
,
a
town
once
in
the
possession
or
the
Portuguese
,
and
where
still
a
great
many
european
family
reside
,
and
particularly
the
missionary
priest
usually
go
thither
,
in
order
to
their
go
forward
to
China
.
  
<EOS>
hither
we
then
resolve
to
go
;
and
accordingly
,
though
alter
a
tedious
and
irregular
course
,
and
very
much
straiten
for
provision
,
we
come
within
sight
of
the
coast
very
early
in
the
morning
;
and
upon
reflection
upon
the
past
circumstance
we
be
in
,
and
the
danger
,
if
we
have
not
escape
,
we
resolve
to
put
into
a
small
river
,
which
,
however
,
have
depth
enough
of
water
for
us
,
and
to
see
if
we
could
,
either
overland
or
by
the
ship
's
pinnace
,
come
to
know
what
ship
be
in
any
port
thereabout
.
<EOS>
this
happy
step
be
,
indeed
,
our
deliverance
;
for
though
we
do
not
immediately
see
any
european
ship
in
the
bay
of
Tonquin
,
yet
the
next
morning
there
come
into
the
bay
two
dutch
ship
;
and
a
third
without
any
colour
;
spread
out
,
but
which
we
believe
to
be
a
Dutchman
,
pass
by
at
about
two
league
distance
,
steer
for
the
coast
of
China
;
and
in
the
afternoon
go
by
two
english
ship
,
steer
the
same
course
;
and
thus
we
think
we
see
ourselves
beset
with
enemy
,
both
one
way
and
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
place
we
be
in
be
wild
and
barbarous
,
the
people
thief
,
even
by
occupation
or
profession
;
and
though
,
it
be
true
,
we
have
not
much
to
seek
of
them
,
and
except
get
a
few
provision
,
care
not
how
little
we
have
to
do
with
them
;
yet
it
be
with
much
difficulty
that
we
keep
ourselves
from
be
insult
by
them
several
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
in
a
small
river
of
this
country
,
within
a
few
league
of
its
utmost
limit
northward
,
and
by
our
boat
we
coast
north
-
east
to
the
point
of
land
which
open
to
the
great
bay
of
Tonquin
:
and
it
be
in
this
beating
up
along
the
shore
that
we
discover
as
above
,
that
,
in
a
word
,
we
be
surround
with
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
people
we
be
among
be
the
most
barbarous
of
all
the
inhabitant
of
the
coast
;
have
no
correspondence
with
any
other
nation
,
and
deal
only
in
fish
and
oil
,
and
such
gross
commodity
;
and
it
may
be
particularly
see
that
they
be
,
as
I
say
,
the
most
barbarous
of
any
of
the
inhabitant
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
among
other
custom
they
have
this
one
,
that
if
any
vessel
have
the
misfortune
to
be
shipwreck
upon
their
coast
,
they
presently
make
the
man
all
prisoner
;
that
be
to
say
,
slave
;
and
it
be
not
long
before
we
find
a
spice
of
their
kindness
this
way
,
on
the
occasion
follow
:
  
<EOS>
I
have
observe
above
that
our
ship
spring
a
leak
at
sea
,
and
that
we
could
not
find
it
out
:
<EOS>
and
however
it
happen
,
that
,
as
I
have
say
,
it
be
stop
unexpectedly
,
in
the
happy
minute
of
our
be
to
be
seize
by
the
dutch
and
english
ship
,
near
the
bay
of
Siam
;
yet
,
as
we
do
not
find
the
ship
so
perfectly
tight
and
sound
as
we
desire
,
we
resolve
,
while
we
be
in
this
place
,
to
lay
her
on
shore
,
take
out
what
heavy
thing
we
have
on
hoard
,
which
be
not
many
,
and
to
wash
and
clean
her
bottom
,
and
if
possible
to
find
out
where
the
leak
be
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
have
lighten
the
ship
,
and
bring
all
our
gun
,
and
other
moveable
thing
,
to
one
side
,
we
try
to
bring
her
down
,
that
we
may
come
at
her
bottom
;
for
,
on
second
thought
,
we
do
not
care
to
lay
her
dry
aground
,
neither
could
we
find
out
a
proper
place
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
,
who
have
never
be
acquaint
with
such
a
sight
,
come
wonder
down
to
the
shore
to
look
at
us
;
and
see
the
ship
lie
down
on
one
side
in
such
a
manner
,
and
heeling
towards
the
shore
,
and
not
see
our
man
,
who
be
at
work
on
her
bottom
with
stage
,
and
with
their
boat
,
on
the
off
side
,
they
presently
conclude
that
the
ship
be
cast
away
,
and
lie
so
very
fast
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
they
come
all
about
us
in
two
or
three
hour
time
,
with
ten
or
twelve
large
boat
,
have
some
of
them
eight
,
some
ten
man
in
a
boat
,
intending
,
no
doubt
,
to
have
come
on
board
and
plunder
the
ship
;
and
if
they
have
find
us
there
,
to
have
carry
us
away
for
slave
to
their
king
,
or
whatever
they
call
him
,
for
we
know
not
who
be
their
governor
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
up
to
the
ship
,
and
begin
to
row
round
her
,
they
discover
us
all
hard
at
work
,
on
the
outside
of
the
ship
's
bottom
and
side
,
washing
,
and
graving
,
and
stop
,
as
every
seafare
man
know
how
.
  
<EOS>
They
stand
for
awhile
gaze
at
us
,
and
we
,
who
be
a
little
surprised
,
could
not
imagine
what
their
design
be
;
but
be
willing
to
be
sure
,
we
take
this
opportunity
to
get
some
of
us
into
the
ship
,
and
other
to
hand
down
arm
and
ammunition
to
those
that
be
at
work
to
defend
themselves
with
,
if
there
should
be
occasion
;
and
it
be
no
more
than
need
;
for
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
consultation
,
they
agree
,
it
seem
,
that
the
ship
be
really
a
wreck
;
that
we
be
all
at
work
endeavour
to
save
her
,
or
to
save
our
life
by
the
help
of
our
boat
;
and
when
we
hand
our
arm
into
the
boat
,
they
conclude
by
that
motion
that
we
be
endeavour
to
save
some
of
our
good
.
<EOS>
upon
this
they
take
it
for
<EOS>
grant
they
all
belong
to
them
,
and
away
they
come
directly
upon
our
man
,
as
if
it
have
be
in
a
line
of
battle
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
see
so
many
of
them
begin
to
be
fright
,
for
we
lay
but
in
an
ill
posture
to
fight
,
and
cry
out
to
us
to
know
what
they
should
do
?
<EOS>
I
immediately
call
to
the
man
who
work
upon
the
stage
,
to
slip
them
down
and
get
up
the
side
into
the
ship
,
and
bade
those
in
the
boat
to
row
round
and
come
on
board
;
and
those
few
of
us
who
be
on
board
work
with
all
the
strength
and
hand
we
have
to
bring
the
ship
to
right
;
but
,
however
,
neither
the
man
upon
the
stage
,
nor
those
in
the
boat
,
could
do
as
they
be
order
,
before
the
Cochinchinese
be
upon
them
,
and
with
two
of
their
boat
board
our
long
-
boat
,
and
begin
to
lay
hold
of
the
man
as
their
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
man
they
lay
hold
of
be
an
english
seaman
,
a
stout
,
strong
fellow
,
who
have
a
musket
in
his
hand
,
never
offer
to
fire
it
,
but
lay
it
down
in
the
boat
,
like
a
fool
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
but
he
understand
his
business
better
than
I
could
teach
him
;
for
he
grapple
the
Pagan
,
and
drag
him
by
main
force
out
of
their
own
boat
into
ours
;
where
take
him
by
the
two
ear
,
he
beat
his
head
so
against
the
boat
's
gunnel
,
that
the
fellow
die
instantly
in
his
hand
;
and
in
the
mean
time
a
Dutchman
,
who
stand
next
,
take
up
the
musket
,
and
with
the
but
-
end
of
it
so
lay
about
him
,
that
he
knock
down
five
of
them
who
attempt
to
enter
the
boat
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
little
towards
resist
thirty
or
forty
man
,
who
fearless
,
because
ignorant
of
their
danger
,
begin
to
throw
themselves
into
the
long
-
boat
,
where
we
have
but
five
man
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
but
one
accident
give
our
man
a
complete
victory
,
which
deserve
our
laughter
rather
than
any
thing
else
,
and
that
be
this
:
    
Our
carpenter
be
prepare
to
grave
the
outside
of
the
ship
,
as
well
as
to
pay
the
seam
where
he
have
caulk
her
to
stop
the
leak
,
<EOS>
have
get
two
kettle
just
let
down
into
the
boat
;
one
fill
with
boiling
pitch
,
and
the
other
with
rosin
,
tallow
,
and
oil
,
and
such
stuff
as
the
shipwright
use
for
that
work
;
and
the
man
that
tend
the
carpenter
have
a
great
iron
ladle
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
supply
the
man
that
be
at
work
with
that
hot
stuff
:
two
of
the
enemy
's
man
enter
the
boat
just
where
this
fellow
stand
,
be
in
the
fore
-
sheet
;
he
immediately
saint
them
with
a
ladleful
of
the
stuff
,
boil
hot
,
which
so
burn
and
scald
them
,
be
half
naked
,
that
they
roar
out
like
two
bull
,
and
,
enrage
with
the
fire
,
leap
both
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
see
it
,
and
cry
out
,
"
well
do
,
Jack
,
give
them
some
more
of
it
;
"
when
step
forward
himself
,
he
take
one
of
their
mop
,
and
dip
it
in
the
pitch
-
pot
,
he
and
his
man
throw
it
among
them
<EOS>
so
plentifully
,
that
,
in
short
,
of
all
the
man
in
three
boat
,
there
be
not
one
that
be
not
scald
and
burn
with
it
in
a
most
frightful
,
pitiful
manner
,
and
make
such
a
howling
and
crying
,
that
I
never
hear
a
bad
noise
,
and
,
indeed
,
nothing
like
it
;
for
it
be
worth
observe
,
<EOS>
that
though
pain
naturally
make
all
people
cry
out
,
yet
every
nation
have
a
particular
way
of
exclamation
,
and
make
noise
as
different
from
one
another
as
their
speech
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
the
noise
these
creature
make
a
well
name
than
howling
,
nor
a
name
more
proper
to
the
tone
of
it
;
for
I
never
hear
any
thing
more
like
the
noise
of
the
wolf
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
hear
howl
in
the
forest
on
the
frontier
of
Languedoc
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
never
pleased
with
a
victory
better
in
my
life
;
not
only
as
it
be
a
perfect
surprise
to
me
,
and
that
our
danger
be
imminent
before
;
but
as
we
get
this
victory
without
any
bloodshed
,
except
of
that
man
the
fellow
kill
with
his
naked
hand
,
and
which
I
be
very
much
concerned
at
;
for
I
be
sick
of
kill
such
poor
savage
wretch
,
even
though
it
be
in
my
own
defence
,
know
they
come
on
errand
which
they
think
just
,
and
know
no
better
;
and
that
though
it
may
be
a
just
thing
,
because
necessary
,
for
there
be
no
necessary
wickedness
in
nature
;
yet
I
think
it
be
a
sad
life
,
when
we
must
be
always
oblige
to
be
kill
our
fellow
-
creature
to
preserve
ourselves
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
think
so
still
;
and
I
would
,
even
now
,
suffer
a
great
deal
,
rather
than
I
would
take
away
the
life
even
of
the
bad
person
injure
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
also
,
all
consider
people
,
who
know
the
value
of
life
,
would
be
of
my
opinion
,
if
they
enter
seriously
into
the
consideration
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
story
.
<EOS>
all
the
while
this
be
do
,
my
partner
and
I
,
who
manage
the
rest
of
the
man
on
board
,
have
,
with
great
dexterity
,
bring
the
ship
almost
to
right
;
and
,
have
get
the
gun
into
their
place
again
,
the
gunner
call
to
me
to
bid
our
boat
get
out
of
the
way
,
for
he
would
let
fly
among
them
.
<EOS>
I
call
back
again
to
him
,
and
bid
him
not
offer
to
fire
,
for
the
carpenter
would
do
the
work
without
him
;
but
bade
him
heat
another
pitch
-
kettle
,
which
our
cook
,
who
be
on
board
,
take
care
of
.
<EOS>
but
the
enemy
be
so
terrified
with
what
they
meet
with
in
their
first
attack
,
that
they
would
not
come
on
again
;
and
some
of
them
that
be
farth
off
,
see
the
ship
swim
,
as
it
be
,
upright
,
begin
,
as
we
suppose
,
to
see
their
mistake
,
and
give
over
the
enterprise
,
find
it
be
not
as
they
expect
.
<EOS>
thus
we
get
clear
of
this
merry
fight
;
and
have
get
some
rice
,
and
some
root
and
bread
,
with
about
sixteen
good
big
hog
on
board
two
day
before
,
we
resolve
to
stay
here
no
longer
,
out
<EOS>
go
forward
<EOS>
,
whatever
come
of
it
;
for
we
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
we
should
be
surround
the
next
day
with
rogue
enough
,
perhaps
more
than
our
pitch
-
kettle
would
dispose
of
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
therefore
get
all
our
thing
on
board
the
same
evening
,
and
the
next
morning
be
ready
to
sail
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
lie
at
an
anchor
some
distance
from
the
shore
,
we
be
not
so
much
concerned
,
be
now
in
a
lighting
posture
,
as
well
as
in
a
sailing
posture
,
if
any
enemy
have
present
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
have
finish
our
work
within
board
,
and
find
our
ship
be
perfectly
heal
of
all
her
leak
,
we
set
sail
.
<EOS>
We
would
have
go
into
the
bay
of
Tonquin
,
for
we
want
to
inform
ourselves
of
what
be
to
be
know
concern
the
dutch
ship
that
have
be
there
;
but
we
durst
not
stand
in
there
,
because
we
have
see
several
ship
go
in
,
as
we
suppose
,
but
a
little
before
;
so
we
keep
on
N.E.
towards
the
isle
of
Formosa
,
as
much
afraid
of
be
see
by
a
dutch
or
english
merchant
-
ship
,
as
a
dutch
or
english
merchant
-
ship
in
the
Mediterranean
be
of
an
Algerine
man
of
war
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
thus
get
to
sea
,
we
keep
on
N.E.
as
if
we
would
go
to
the
Manillas
or
the
philippine
island
,
and
this
we
do
,
that
we
may
not
fall
into
the
way
of
any
of
the
european
ship
;
and
then
we
steer
north
again
,
till
we
come
to
the
latitude
of
22
degree
20
minute
,
by
which
mean
we
make
the
island
of
Formosa
directly
,
where
we
come
to
an
anchor
,
in
order
to
get
water
and
fresh
provision
,
which
the
people
there
,
who
be
very
courteous
and
civil
in
their
manner
,
supply
us
with
willingly
,
and
deal
very
fairly
and
punctually
with
us
in
all
their
agreement
and
bargain
,
which
be
what
we
do
not
find
among
other
people
,
and
may
be
owe
to
the
remain
of
Christianity
,
which
be
once
plant
here
by
a
dutch
mission
of
Protestants
,
and
be
a
testimony
of
what
I
have
often
observe
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
christian
religion
always
civilize
the
people
and
reform
their
manner
,
where
it
be
receive
,
whether
it
work
save
effect
upon
them
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
we
sail
still
north
,
keep
the
coast
of
China
at
an
equal
distance
,
till
we
know
we
be
beyond
all
the
port
of
China
where
our
european
ship
usually
come
:
but
be
resolve
,
if
possible
,
not
to
fall
into
any
of
their
hand
,
especially
in
this
country
,
where
,
as
our
circumstance
be
,
we
could
not
fail
of
be
entirely
ruin
;
nay
,
so
great
be
my
fear
in
particular
,
as
to
my
be
take
by
them
,
that
I
believe
firmly
I
would
much
rather
have
choose
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
Spanish
Inquisition
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
come
to
the
latitude
of
30
degree
,
we
resolve
to
put
into
the
first
trading
port
we
should
come
at
,
and
stand
in
for
the
shore
,
a
boat
come
off
two
league
to
us
,
with
an
old
portuguese
pilot
on
board
,
who
,
know
us
to
be
an
european
ship
,
come
to
offer
his
service
,
which
indeed
we
be
very
glad
of
,
and
take
him
on
board
;
upon
which
,
without
ask
us
whither
we
would
go
,
he
dismiss
the
boat
he
come
in
,
and
send
it
back
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
now
so
much
in
our
choice
to
make
the
old
man
carry
us
whither
we
would
,
that
I
begin
to
talk
with
him
about
carry
us
to
the
gulf
of
Nanquin
,
which
be
the
most
northern
part
of
the
coast
of
China
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
say
he
know
the
gulf
of
Nanquin
very
well
;
but
smile
,
ask
us
what
we
would
do
there
?
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
we
would
sell
our
cargo
,
and
purchase
China
ware
,

and
so
would
return
by
the
same
course
we
come
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
our
good
port
have
be
to
have
put
in
at
Macao
,
where
we
could
not
fail
of
a
market
for
our
opium
to
our
satisfaction
,
and
may
,
for
our
money
,
have
purchase
all
sort
of
China
good
as
cheap
as
we
could
at
Nanquin
.
  
<EOS>
not
be
able
to
put
the
old
man
out
of
his
talk
,
of
which
he
be
very
opinionated
,
or
conceite
,
I
tell
him
we
be
gentleman
as
well
as
merchant
,
and
that
we
have
a
mind
to
go
and
see
the
great
city
of
Pekin
,
and
the
famous
court
of
the
monarch
of
China
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
you
should
go
to
Ningpo
,
where
,
by
the
river
that
run
into
the
sea
there
,
you
may
go
up
within
five
league
of
the
great
canal
.
<EOS>
this
canal
be
a
navigable
make
stream
,
which
go
through
the
heart
of
all
that
vast
empire
of
China
,
cross
all
the
river
,
pass
some
considerable
hill
by
the
help
of
sluice
and
gate
,
and
go
up
to
the
city
of
Pekin
,
be
in
length
near
two
hundred
and
seventy
league
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
seignior
Portuguese
,
but
that
be
not
our
business
now
;
the
great
question
be
,
if
you
can
carry
us
up
to
the
city
of
Nanquin
,
from
whence
we
can
travel
to
Pekin
afterwards
?
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
say
,
he
could
do
so
very
well
,
and
there
be
a
great
dutch
ship
go
up
that
way
just
before
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
a
little
shock
;
a
dutch
ship
be
now
our
terror
,
and
we
have
much
rather
have
meet
the
devil
,
at
least
if
he
have
not
come
in
too
frightful
a
figure
;
we
depend
upon
it
that
a
dutch
ship
would
be
our
destruction
,
for
we
be
in
no
condition
to
fight
them
;
all
the
ship
they
trade
with
in
those
part
be
of
great
burden
,
and
of
much
great
force
than
we
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
find
me
a
little
confused
,
and
under
some
concern
,
when
he
name
a
dutch
ship
:
and
say
to
me
,
"
Sir
,
you
need
be
under
no
apprehension
of
the
Dutch
;
I
suppose
they
be
not
now
at
war
with
your
nation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
be
true
;
but
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
libertie
man
may
take
when
they
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
law
of
their
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
you
be
no
pirate
,
what
need
you
fear
?
<EOS>
They
will
not
meddle
with
peaceable
merchant
,
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
any
blood
in
my
body
that
do
not
fly
up
into
my
face
at
that
word
,
it
be
hinder
by
some
stop
in
the
vessel
appoint
by
nature
to
circulate
it
;
for
it
put
me
into
the
great
disorder
and
confusion
imaginable
;
nor
be
it
possible
for
me
to
conceal
it
so
,
but
that
the
old
man
easily
perceive
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
find
you
be
in
some
disorder
in
your
thought
at
my
talk
;
pray
be
pleased
to
go
which
way
you
think
fit
,
and
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
I
will
do
you
all
the
service
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Seignior
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
be
true
,
I
be
a
little
unsettled
in
my
resolution
at
this
time
,
whither
to
go
in
particular
;
and
I
be
something
more
so
for
what
you
say
about
pirate
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
be
no
pirate
in
these
sea
;
we
be
<EOS>
but
in
an
ill
condition
to
meet
with
them
;
for
you
see
we
have
but
a
small
force
,
and
but
very
weakly
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
be
concern
;
I
do
not
know
that
there
have
be
any
pirate
in
these
sea
these
fifteen
year
,
except
one
,
which
be
see
,
as
I
hear
,
in
the
bay
of
Siam
,
about
a
month
since
;
but
you
may
be
assure
she
be
go
to
the
southward
;
nor
be
she
a
ship
of
any
great
force
,
or
fit
for
the
work
;
she
be
not
build
for
a
privateer
,
but
be
run
away
with
by
a
reprobate
crew
that
be
on
board
,
after
the
captain
and
some
of
his
man
have
be
murder
by
the
Malaccans
,
at
or
near
the
island
of
Sumatra
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
say
I
,
seem
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
"
do
they
murder
the
captain
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
that
they
murder
him
;
but
as
they
afterwards
run
away
with
the
ship
,
it
be
generally
believe
they
betray
him
into
the
hand
of
the
Malaccans
,
who
do
murder
him
;
and
,
perhaps
,
they
procure
them
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
they
deserve
death
,
as
much
as
if
they
have
do
it
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
they
do
deserve
it
,
and
they
will
certainly
have
it
if
they
light
upon
any
english
or
dutch
ship
;
for
they
have
all
agree
together
that
if
they
meet
that
rogue
they
will
give
him
no
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
you
say
the
pirate
be
go
out
of
these
sea
;
how
can
they
meet
with
him
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
true
,
"
say
he
,
"
they
do
say
so
;
but
he
be
,
as
I
tell
you
,
in
the
bay
of
Siam
,
in
the
river
Cambodia
,
and
be
discover
there
by
some
dutchman
who
belong
to
the
ship
,
and
who
be
leave
on
shore
when
they
run
away
with
her
;
and
some
english
and
dutch
trader
be
in
the
river
,
they
be
within
a
little
of
take
him
.
<EOS>
nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
the
foremost
boat
have
be
well
second
by
the
rest
,
they
have
certainly
take
him
;
but
he
find
only
two
boat
within
reach
of
him
,
tack
about
,
and
fire
at
these
two
,
and
disable
them
before
the
other
come
up
;
and
then
stand
off
to
sea
,
the
other
be
not
able
to
follow
him
,
and
so
he
get
away
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
all
so
exact
a
description
of
the
ship
,
that
they
will
be
sure
to
know
him
;
and
where
-
ever
they
find
him
,
they
have
vow
to
give
no
quarter
to
either
the
captain
or
the
seaman
,
but
to
hang
them
all
up
at
the
yard
-
arm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
say
I
,
"
will
they
execute
them
,
right
or
wrong
;
hang
them
first
,
and
judge
them
afterwards
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
Sir
!
"
say
the
old
pilot
,
"
there
be
no
need
to
make
a
formal
business
of
it
with
such
rogue
as
those
;
let
them
tie
them
back
to
back
,
and
set
them
a
-
diving
;
it
be
no
more
than
they
rightly
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
my
old
man
fast
aboard
,
and
that
he
could
do
me
no
harm
;
so
I
turn
short
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
Seignior
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
this
be
the
very
reason
why
I
would
have
you
carry
us
to
Nanquin
,
and
not
to
put
back
to
Macao
,
or
to
any
other
part
of
the
country
where
the
english
or
dutch
ship
come
;
for
be
it
known
to
you
,
Seignior
,
those
captain
of
the
english
and
dutch
ship
be
a
parcel
of
rash
,
proud
,
insolent
fellow
,
that
neither
know
what
belong
to
justice
,
or
how
to
behave
themselves
as
the
law
of
God
and
nature
direct
;
but
be
proud
of
their
office
,
and
not
understand
their
power
,
they
would
get
the
murderer
to
punish
robber
;
would
take
upon
them
to
insult
man
falsely
accuse
,
and
determine
them
guilty
without
due
inquiry
;
and
perhaps
I
may
live
to
call
some
of
them
to
an
account
of
it
,
where
they
may
be
teach
how
justice
be
to
be
execute
;
and
that
no
man
ought
to
be
treat
as
a
criminal
till
some
evidence
may
be
have
of
the
crime
,
and
that
he
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
I
tell
him
,
that
this
be
the
very
ship
they
have
attack
;
and
give
him
a
full
account
of
the
skirmish
we
have
with
their
boat
,
and
how
foolishly
and
coward
-
like
they
have
behave
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
all
the
story
of
our
buying
the
ship
,
and
how
the
dutchman
serve
us
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
reason
I
have
to
believe
that
this
story
of
kill
the
master
by
the
Malaccans
be
not
true
;
as
also
the
run
away
with
the
ship
;
but
that
it
be
all
a
fiction
of
their
own
,
to
suggest
that
the
man
be
turn
pirate
;
and
they
ought
to
have
be
sure
it
be
so
,
before
they
have
venture
to
attack
us
by
surprise
,
and
oblige
us
so
resist
them
;
add
,
that
they
would
have
the
blood
of
those
man
who
be
kill
there
,
in
our
just
defence
,
to
answer
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
amazed
at
this
relation
;
and
tell
us
,
we
be
very
much
in
the
right
to
go
away
to
the
north
;
and
that
if
he
may
advise
us
,
it
should
be
to
sell
the
ship
in
China
,
which
we
may
very
well
do
,
and
buy
or
build
another
in
the
country
;
"
and
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
you
will
not
get
so
good
<EOS>
a
ship
,
yet
you
may
get
one
able
enough
to
carry
you
and
all
your
good
back
again
to
Bengal
,
or
any
where
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
take
his
advice
when
I
come
to
any
port
where
I
could
find
a
ship
for
my
turn
,
or
get
any
customer
to
buy
this
.
<EOS>
He
reply
,
I
should
meet
with
customer
enough
for
the
ship
at
Nanquin
,
and
that
a
chinese
junk
would
serve
me
very
well
to
go
back
again
;
and
that
he
would
procure
me
people
both
to
buy
one
and
sell
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
Seignior
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
you
say
they
know
the
ship
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
if
I
follow
your
measure
,
be
instrumental
to
bring
some
honest
innocent
man
into
a
terrible
broil
,
and
,
perhaps
,
be
murder
in
cold
blood
;
for
wherever
they
find
the
ship
they
will
prove
the
guilt
upon
the
man
by
prove
this
be
the
ship
,
and
so
innocent
man
may
probably
be
overpower
and
murder
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
I
will
find
out
a
way
to
prevent
that
also
;
for
as
I
know
all
those
commander
you
speak
of
very
well
,
and
shall
see
them
all
as
they
pass
by
,
I
will
be
sure
to
set
them
to
right
in
the
thing
,
and
let
them
know
that
they
have
be
so
much
in
the
wrong
;
that
though
the
people
who
be
on
board
at
first
may
run
away
with
the
ship
,
yet
it
be
not
true
that
they
have
turn
pirate
;
and
that
in
particular
those
be
not
the
man
that
first
go
off
with
the
ship
,
but
innocently
buy
her
for
their
trade
;
and
I
be
persuade
they
will
so
far
believe
me
,
as
,
at
least
,
to
act
more
cautiously
for
the
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
will
you
deliver
one
message
to
them
from
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
will
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
will
give
it
under
your
hand
in
writing
,
that
I
may
be
able
to
prove
it
come
from
you
,
and
not
out
of
my
own
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
that
I
would
readily
give
it
him
under
my
hand
.
<EOS>
so
I
take
a
pen
and
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
write
at
large
the
story
of
assault
me
with
the
long
-
boat
,
&
c.
the
pretended
reason
of
it
,
and
the
unjust
,
cruel
design
of
it
;
and
conclude
to
the
commander
that
they
have
do
what
they
not
only
should
have
be
ashamed
or
,
but
also
,
that
if
ever
they
come
to
England
,
and
I
live
to
see
them
there
,
they
should
all
pay
dearly
for
it
,
if
the
law
of
my
country
be
not
grow
out
of
use
before
I
arrive
there
.
  
<EOS>
My
old
pilot
read
this
over
and
over
again
,
and
ask
me
several
time
if
I
would
stand
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
I
would
stand
to
it
as
long
as
I
have
any
thing
leave
in
the
world
;
be
sensible
that
I
should
,
one
time
or
other
,
find
an
opportunity
to
put
it
home
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
no
occasion
ever
to
let
the
pilot
carry
this
letter
,
for
he
never
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
while
those
thing
be
pass
between
us
,
by
way
of
discourse
,
we
go
forward
directly
for
Nanquin
,
and
,
in
about
thirteen
day
sail
,
come
to
anchor
at
the
south
-
west
point
of
the
great
gulf
of
Nanquin
;
where
,
by
the
way
,
I
come
by
accident
to
understand
,
that
the
two
dutch
ship
be
go
that
length
before
me
,
and
that
I
should
certainly
fall
into
their
hand
.
<EOS>
I
consult
my
partner
again
in
this
exigency
,
and
he
be
as
much
at
a
loss
as
I
be
,
and
would
very
gladly
have
be
safe
on
shore
<EOS>
almost
any
where
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
not
in
such
perplexity
neither
,
but
I
ask
the
old
pilot
if
there
be
no
creek
or
harbour
,
which
I
may
put
into
,
and
pursue
my
business
with
the
Chinese
privately
,
and
be
in
no
danger
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
if
I
would
sail
to
the
southward
about
two
-
and
-
forty
league
,
there
be
a
little
port
call
Quinchang
,
where
the
father
of
the
mission
usually
land
from
Macao
,
on
their
progress
to
teach
the
christian
religion
to
the
Chinese
,
and
where
no
european
ship
ever
put
in
:
and
,
if
I
think
proper
to
put
in
there
,
I
may
consider
what
farther
course
to
take
when
I
be
on
shore
.
<EOS>
He
confess
,
he
say
,
it
be
not
a
place
for
merchant
,
except
that
at
some
certain
time
they
have
a
kind
of
a
fair
there
,
when
the
merchant
from
Japan
come
over
thither
to
buy
the
chinese
merchandise
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
agree
to
go
back
to
this
place
:
the
name
of
the
port
,
as
he
call
it
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
spell
wrong
,
for
I
do
not
particularly
remember
it
,
have
lose
this
,
together
with
the
name
of
many
other
place
set
down
in
a
little
pocket
-
book
,
which
be
spoil
by
the
water
,
on
an
accident
which
I
shall
relate
in
its
order
;
but
this
I
remember
,
that
the
chinese
or
japanese
merchant
we
correspond
with
call
it
by
a
different
name
from
that
which
our
portuguese
pilot
give
it
,
and
pronounce
it
as
above
,
Quinchang
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
unanimous
in
our
resolution
to
go
to
this
place
,
we
weigh
the
next
day
,
have
only
go
twice
on
shore
,
where
we
be
to
get
fresh
water
;
on
both
which
occasion
the
people
of
the
country
be
very
civil
to
us
,
and
bring
us
abundance
of
thing
to
sell
to
us
;
I
mean
of
provision
,
plant
,
root
,
tea
,
rice
,
and
some
fowl
;
but
nothing
without
money
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
to
the
other
port
(
the
wind
be
contrary
)
not
till
five
day
;
but
it
be
very
much
to
our
satisfaction
,
and
I
be
joyful
,
and
I
may
say
thankful
,
when
I
set
my
foot
safe
on
shore
,
resolve
,
and
my
partner
too
,
that
if
it
be
possible
to
dispose
of
ourselves
and
effect
any
other
way
,
though
not
every
way
to
our
satisfaction
,
we
would
never
set
one
foot
on
board
that
unhappy
vessel
again
:
and
indeed
I
must
acknowledge
,
that
of
all
the
circumstance
of
life
that
ever
I
have
any
experience
of
,
nothing
make
mankind
so
completely
miserable
as
that
of
be
in
constant
fear
.
<EOS>
well
do
the
scripture
say
,
"
the
fear
of
man
bring
a
snare
;
"
it
be
a
life
of
death
,
and
the
mind
be
so
entirely
suppress
by
it
,
that
it
be
capable
of
no
relief
;
the
animal
spirit
sink
,
and
all
the
vigour
of
nature
,
which
usually
support
man
under
other
affliction
,
and
be
present
to
them
in
the
great
exigency
,
fail
them
here
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
it
fail
of
its
usual
operation
upon
the
fancy
,
by
heighten
every
danger
;
represent
the
english
and
dutch
captain
to
be
man
incapable
of
hear
reason
,
or
distinguish
between
honest
man
and
rogue
;
or
between
a
story
calculate
for
our
own
turn
,
make
out
of
nothing
,
on
purpose
to
deceive
,
and
a
true
genuine
account
of
our
whole
voyage
,
progress
,
and
design
;
for
we
may
many
way
have
convince
any
reasonable
creature
that
we
be
not
pirate
;
the
good
we
have
on
board
,
the
course
we
steer
,
our
frankly
shew
ourselves
,
and
enter
into
such
and
such
port
;
even
our
very
manner
,
the
force
we
have
,
the
number
of
man
,
the
few
arm
,
little
ammunition
,
and
short
provision
;
all
these
would
have
serve
to
convince
any
man
that
we
be
no
pirate
.
<EOS>
the
opium
,
and
other
good
we
have
on
board
,
would
make
it
appear
the
ship
have
be
at
Bengal
;
the
dutchman
,
who
,
it
be
say
,
have
the
name
of
all
the
man
that
be
in
the
ship
,
may
easily
see
that
we
be
a
mixture
of
english
,
Portuguese
,
and
Indians
,
and
but
two
dutchman
on
board
.
<EOS>
these
,
and
many
other
particular
circumstance
,
may
have
make
it
evident
to
the
understanding
of
any
commander
,
whose
hand
we
may
fall
into
,
that
we
be
no
pirate
.
  
<EOS>
but
fear
,
that
blind
useless
passion
,
work
another
way
,
and
throw
us
into
the
vapour
;
it
bewilder
our
understanding
,
and
set
the
imagination
at
work
,
to
form
a
thousand
terrible
thing
,
that
,
perhaps
,
may
never
happen
.
<EOS>
We
first
suppose
,
as
indeed
every
body
have
relate
to
us
,
that
the
seaman
on
board
the
english
and
dutch
ship
,
but
especially
the
Dutch
,
be
so
enraged
at
the
name
of
a
pirate
,
and
especially
at
our
beating
off
their
boat
,
and
escape
,
that
they
would
not
give
themselves
leave
to
inquire
whether
we
be
pirate
or
no
;
but
would
execute
us
off
-
hand
,
as
we
call
it
,
without
give
us
any
room
for
a
defence
.
<EOS>
We
reflect
that
there
be
really
so
much
apparent
evidence
before
them
,
that
they
would
scarce
inquire
after
any
more
:
as
,
first
,
that
the
ship
be
certainly
the
same
,
and
that
some
of
the
seaman
among
them
know
her
,
and
have
be
on
board
her
;
and
,
secondly
,
that
when
we
have
intelligence
at
the
river
Cambodia
,
that
they
be
come
down
to
examine
us
,
we
fight
their
boat
,
and
flee
:
so
that
we
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
they
be
as
fully
satisfied
of
our
be
pirate
as
we
be
satisfied
of
the
contrary
;
and
I
often
say
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
be
apt
to
have
take
the
like
circumstance
for
evidence
,
if
the
table
be
turn
,
and
my
case
be
theirs
;
and
have
make
no
scruple
of
cut
all
the
crew
to
piece
,
without
believe
,
or
perhaps
consider
,
what
they
may
have
to
offer
in
their
defence
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
that
be
how
it
will
,
those
be
our
apprehension
;
and
both
my
partner
and
I
<EOS>
too
scarce
sleep
a
night
without
dream
of
halter
and
yard
-
arm
;
that
be
to
say
,
gibbet
;
of
fighting
,
and
be
take
;
of
killing
,
and
be
kill
;
and
one
night
I
be
in
such
a
fury
in
my
dream
,
fancy
the
Dutchmen
have
board
us
,
and
I
be
knock
one
of
their
seaman
down
,
that
I
strike
my
double
fist
against
the
side
of
the
cabin
I
lie
in
,
with
such
a
force
as
wound
my
hand
most
gievously
,
break
my
knuckle
,
and
cut
and
bruise
the
flesh
,
so
that
it
not
only
wake
me
out
of
my
sleep
,
but
I
be
once
afraid
I
should
have
lose
two
of
my
finger
.
  
<EOS>
another
apprehension
I
have
,
be
,
of
the
cruel
usage
we
should
meet
with
from
them
,
if
we
fall
into
their
hand
:
then
the
story
of
Amboyna
come
into
my
head
,
and
how
the
Dutch
may
,
perhaps
,
torture
us
,
as
they
do
our
countryman
there
;
and
make
some
of
our
man
,
by
extremity
of
torture
,
confess
those
crime
they
never
be
guilty
of
;
own
themselves
,
and
all
of
us
,
to
be
pirate
;
and
so
they
would
put
us
to
death
,
with
a
formal
appearance
of
justice
;
and
that
they
may
be
tempt
to
do
this
for
the
gain
of
our
ship
and
cargo
,
which
be
worth
four
or
five
thousand
pound
,
put
all
together
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
torment
me
,
and
my
partner
too
,
night
and
day
;
nor
do
we
consider
that
the
captain
of
ship
have
no
authority
to
act
thus
;
and
if
we
have
surrender
prisoner
to
them
,
they
could
not
answer
the
destroy
us
,
or
torture
us
,
but
would
be
accountable
for
it
when
they
come
into
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
give
me
no
satisfaction
;
for
,
if
they
will
act
thus
with
us
,
what
advantage
would
it
be
to
us
that
they
would
be
call
to
an
account
for
it
?
<EOS>
or
,
if
we
be
first
to
be
murder
,
what
satisfaction
would
it
be
to
us
to
have
them
punish
when
they
come
home
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
refrain
take
notice
here
<EOS>
what
reflection
I
now
have
upon
the
past
variety
of
my
particular
circumstance
;
how
hard
I
think
it
be
,
that
I
,
who
have
spend
forty
year
in
a
life
of
continued
difficulty
,
and
be
at
last
come
,
as
it
be
,
at
the
port
or
haven
which
all
man
drive
at
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
have
rest
and
plenty
,
should
be
a
volunteer
in
new
sorrow
,
by
my
own
unhappy
choice
;
and
that
I
,
who
have
escape
so
many
danger
in
my
youth
,
should
now
come
to
be
hang
,
in
my
old
age
,
and
in
so
remote
a
place
,
for
a
crime
I
be
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
,
much
less
guilty
of
;
and
in
a
place
and
circumstance
,
where
innocence
be
not
like
to
be
any
protection
at
all
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
these
thought
,
something
of
religion
would
come
in
;
and
I
would
be
consider
that
this
seem
to
me
to
be
a
disposition
of
immediate
Providence
;
and
I
ought
to
look
upon
it
,
and
submit
to
it
as
such
:
that
although
I
be
innocent
as
to
man
,
I
be
far
from
be
innocent
as
to
my
maker
;
and
I
ought
to
look
in
,
and
examine
what
other
crime
in
my
life
be
most
obvious
to
me
,
and
for
which
Providence
may
justly
inflict
this
punishment
as
a
retribution
;
and
that
I
ought
to
submit
to
this
,
just
as
I
would
to
a
shipwreck
,
if
it
have
please
God
to
have
bring
such
a
disaster
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
its
turn
,
natural
courage
would
sometimes
take
its
place
;
and
then
I
would
be
talk
myself
up
to
vigorous
resolution
,
that
I
would
not
be
take
to
be
barbarously
use
by
a
parcel
of
merciless
wretch
in
cold
blood
;
that
it
be
much
well
to
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
savage
,
who
be
man
-
eater
,
and
who
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
would
feast
upon
me
,
when
they
have
take
me
,
than
by
those
who
would
perhaps
glut
their
rage
upon
me
by
inhuman
torture
and
barbarity
:
that
,
in
the
case
of
the
savage
,
I
always
resolve
to
die
fighting
to
the
last
gasp
;
and
why
should
I
not
do
so
now
,
see
it
be
much
more
dreadful
,
to
me
at
least
,
to
think
of
fall
into
these
man
's
hand
,
<EOS>
than
ever
it
be
to
think
of
be
eat
by
man
?
<EOS>
for
the
savage
,
give
them
their
due
,
would
not
eat
a
man
till
he
be
dead
;
and
kill
him
first
,
as
we
do
a
bullock
;
but
that
these
man
have
many
art
beyond
the
cruelty
of
death
.
<EOS>
whenever
these
thought
prevail
I
be
sure
to
put
myself
into
a
kind
of
fever
,
with
the
agitation
of
a
suppose
fight
;
my
blood
would
boil
,
and
my
eye
sparkle
,
as
if
I
be
engage
;
and
I
always
resolve
that
I
would
take
no
quarter
at
their
hand
;
but
even
at
last
,
if
I
could
resist
no
longer
,
I
would
blow
up
the
ship
,
and
all
that
be
in
her
,
and
leave
them
but
little
booty
to
boast
of
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
how
much
the
great
weight
the
anxiety
and
perplexity
of
those
thing
be
to
our
thought
while
we
be
at
sea
,
by
so
much
the
great
be
our
satisfaction
when
we
see
ourselves
on
shore
;
and
my
partner
tell
me
he
dream
that
he
have
a
very
heavy
load
upon
his
back
,
which
he
be
to
carry
up
a
hill
,
and
find
that
he
be
not
able
to
stand
long
under
it
;
but
the
portuguese
pilot
come
,
and
take
it
off
his
back
,
and
the
hill
disappear
,
the
ground
before
him
shew
all
smooth
and
plain
:
and
truly
it
be
so
;
we
be
all
like
man
who
have
a
load
take
off
their
back
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
have
a
weight
take
off
from
my
heart
,
that
I
be
not
able
any
longer
to
bear
;
and
,
as
I
say
above
,
we
resolve
to
go
no
more
to
sea
in
that
ship
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
on
shore
,
the
old
pilot
,
who
be
now
our
friend
,
get
us
a
lodging
,
and
a
warehouse
for
our
good
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
much
the
same
:
it
be
a
little
house
,
or
hut
,
with
a
large
house
join
to
it
,
all
build
with
cane
,
and
palisadoe
round
with
large
cane
,
to
keep
out
pilfer
thief
,
of
which
it
seem
there
be
not
a
few
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
magistrate
allow
us
all
a
little
guard
,
and
we
have
a
soldier
with
a
kind
of
halbert
,
or
half
-
pike
,
who
stand
sentinel
at
our
door
,
to
whom
we
allow
a
pint
of
rice
,
and
a
little
piece
of
money
,
about
the
value
of
three
-
penny
,
per
day
:
so
that
our
good
be
keep
very
safe
.
  
<EOS>
the
fair
or
mart
usually
keep
in
this
place
have
be
over
some
time
;
however
,
we
find
that
there
be
three
or
four
junk
in
the
river
,
and
two
Japanners
,
I
mean
ship
from
Japan
,
with
good
which
they
have
buy
in
China
,
and
be
not
go
away
,
have
japanese
merchant
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
our
old
portuguese
pilot
do
for
us
be
to
bring
us
acquaint
with
three
missionary
romish
priest
,
who
be
in
the
town
,
and
who
have
be
there
some
time
,
convert
the
people
to
Christianity
;
but
we
think
they
make
but
poor
work
of
it
,
and
make
them
but
sorry
Christians
when
they
have
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
be
not
our
business
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
be
a
Frenchman
,
whom
they
call
Father
Simon
;
he
be
a
jolly
well
-
condition
man
,
very
free
in
his
conversation
,
not
seem
so
serious
and
grave
as
the
other
two
do
,
one
of
whom
be
a
Portuguese
,
and
the
other
a
Genoese
:
but
Father
Simon
be
courteous
,
easy
in
his
manner
,
and
very
agreeable
company
;
the
other
two
be
more
reserved
,
seem
rigid
and
austere
,
and
apply
seriously
to
the
work
they
come
about
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
talk
with
,
and
insinuate
themselves
among
the
inhabitant
wherever
they
have
opportunity
.
<EOS>
We
often
eat
and
drink
with
those
man
;
and
though
I
must
confess
,
the
conversion
,
as
they
call
it
,
of
the
Chinese
to
Christianity
,
be
so
far
from
the
true
conversion
require
to
bring
heathen
people
to
the
faith
of
Christ
,
that
it
seem
to
amount
to
little
more
than
let
them
know
the
name
of
Christ
,
say
some
prayer
to
the
Virgin
Mary
and
her
Son
,
in
a
tongue
which
they
understand
not
,
and
to
cross
themselves
,
and
the
like
;
yet
it
must
be
confess
that
these
religious
,
whom
we
call
missionary
,
have
a
firm
belief
that
these
people
should
be
save
,
and
that
they
be
the
instrument
of
it
;
and
,
on
this
account
,
they
undergo
not
only
the
fatigue
of
the
voyage
,
and
hazard
of
live
in
such
place
,
but
oftentime
death
itself
,
with
the
most
violent
torture
,
for
the
sake
of
this
work
:
and
it
would
be
a
great
want
of
charity
in
us
,
<EOS>
whatever
opinion
we
have
of
the
work
itself
,
and
the
manner
of
their
do
it
,
if
we
should
not
have
a
good
opinion
of
their
zeal
,
who
undertake
it
with
so
many
hazard
,
and
who
have
no
prospect
of
the
least
temporal
advantage
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
story
:
this
french
priest
,
Father
Simon
,
be
appoint
,
it
seem
,
by
order
of
the
chief
of
the
mission
,
to
go
up
to
Pekin
,
the
royal
seat
of
the
chinese
emperor
;
and
wait
only
for
another
priest
,
who
be
order
to
come
to
him
from
Macao
,
to
go
along
with
him
;
and
we
scarce
ever
meet
together
but
he
be
invite
me
to
go
that
journey
with
him
,
tell
me
,
how
he
would
shew
me
<EOS>
all
the
glorious
thing
of
that
mighty
empire
;
and
among
the
rest
the
great
city
in
the
world
;
"
a
city
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
your
London
and
our
Paris
put
together
can
not
he
equal
to
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
city
of
Pekin
,
which
,
I
confess
,
be
very
great
,
and
infinitely
full
of
people
;
but
as
I
look
on
those
thing
with
different
eye
from
other
man
,
so
I
shall
give
my
opinion
of
them
in
few
word
when
I
come
in
the
course
of
my
travel
to
speak
more
particularly
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
first
I
come
to
my
friar
or
missionary
:
dine
with
him
one
day
,
and
be
very
merry
together
<EOS>
,
I
show
some
little
inclination
to
go
with
him
;
and
he
press
me
and
my
partner
very
hard
,
and
with
a
great
many
persuasion
,
to
consent
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
Father
Simon
,
"
say
my
partner
,
"
why
should
you
desire
our
company
so
much
?
<EOS>
You
know
we
be
heretic
,
and
you
do
not
love
us
,
nor
can
keep
us
company
with
any
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
you
may
,
perhaps
,
be
good
Catholics
in
time
;
my
business
here
be
to
convert
heathen
,
and
who
know
<EOS>
but
I
may
convert
you
too
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
Father
,
"
say
I
,
"
so
you
will
preach
to
us
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
troublesome
to
you
,
"
say
he
;
"
our
religion
do
not
divest
us
of
good
manner
;
besides
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
be
all
here
like
countryman
;
and
so
we
be
,
compare
to
the
place
we
be
in
;
and
if
you
be
hugonot
,
and
I
a
Catholic
,
we
may
be
all
Christians
at
last
;
at
least
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
be
all
gentleman
,
and
we
may
converse
so
,
without
be
uneasy
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
that
part
of
his
discourse
very
well
,
and
it
begin
to
put
me
in
mind
of
my
priest
that
I
have
leave
in
the
brasil
;
but
this
Father
Simon
do
not
come
up
to
his
character
by
a
great
deal
;
for
though
Father
Simon
have
no
appearance
of
a
criminal
levity
in
him
neither
,
yet
he
have
not
that
fund
of
Christian
zeal
,
strict
piety
,
and
sincere
affection
to
religion
,
that
my
other
good
ecclesiastic
have
,
of
whom
I
have
say
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
leave
him
a
little
,
though
he
never
leave
us
,
nor
solicit
us
to
go
with
him
,
but
we
have
something
else
before
us
at
that
time
;
for
we
have
all
this
while
our
ship
and
our
merchandise
to
dispose
of
;
and
we
begin
to
be
very
doubtful
what
we
should
do
,
for
we
be
now
in
a
place
of
very
little
business
;
and
once
I
be
about
to
venture
to
sail
for
the
river
of
Kilam
,
and
the
city
of
Nanquin
:
<EOS>
but
Providence
seem
now
more
visibly
,
as
I
think
,
than
ever
,
to
concern
itself
in
our
affair
;
and
I
be
encourage
from
this
very
time
to
think
I
should
,
one
way
or
other
,
get
out
of
this
entangle
circumstance
,
and
be
bring
home
to
my
own
country
again
,
though
I
have
not
the
least
view
of
the
manner
;
and
when
I
begin
sometimes
to
think
of
it
,
could
not
imagine
by
what
method
it
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
Providence
,
I
say
,
begin
here
to
clear
up
our
way
a
little
;
and
the
first
thing
that
offer
be
,
that
our
old
portuguese
pilot
bring
a
Japan
merchant
to
us
,
who
begin
to
inquire
what
good
we
have
;
and
,
in
the
first
place
,
he
buy
all
our
opium
,
and
give
us
a
very
good
price
for
it
,
pay
us
in
gold
by
weight
,
some
in
small
piece
of
their
own
coin
,
and
some
in
small
wedge
,
of
about
ten
or
eleven
ounce
each
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
deal
with
him
for
our
opium
,
it
come
into
my
head
that
he
may
,
perhaps
,
deal
with
us
for
the
ship
too
;
and
I
order
the
interpreter
to
propose
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
shrink
up
his
shoulder
at
it
,
when
it
be
first
propose
to
him
;
but
in
a
few
day
after
he
come
to
me
,
with
one
of
the
missionary
priest
for
his
interpreter
,
and
tell
me
he
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
me
,
and
that
be
this
:
he
have
buy
a
great
quantity
of
good
of
us
when
he
have
no
thought
(
or
proposal
make
to
him
)
of
buy
the
ship
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
he
have
not
money
enough
to
pay
for
the
ship
;
but
if
I
would
let
the
same
man
who
be
in
the
ship
navigate
her
,
he
would
hire
the
ship
to
go
to
Japan
,
and
would
send
them
from
thence
to
the
philippine
island
with
another
loading
,
which
he
would
pay
the
freight
of
before
they
go
from
Japan
;
and
that
,
at
their
return
,
he
would
buy
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
listen
to
this
proposal
;
and
so
eager
do
my
head
still
run
upon
rambling
,
that
I
could
not
but
begin
to
entertain
a
notion
myself
of
go
with
him
,
and
so
to
sail
from
the
philippine
island
away
to
the
South
Seas
;
and
accordingly
I
ask
the
japanese
merchant
if
he
would
not
hire
us
to
the
philippine
island
,
and
discharge
us
there
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
,
he
could
not
do
that
,
for
then
he
could
not
have
the
return
of
his
cargo
;
but
he
would
discharge
us
in
Japan
,
he
say
,
at
the
ship
's
return
.
<EOS>
well
,
still
I
be
for
take
him
at
that
proposal
,
and
go
myself
;
but
my
partner
,
wise
than
myself
,
persuade
me
from
it
,
represent
the
danger
,
as
well
of
the
sea
,
as
of
the
Japanese
,
who
be
a
false
,
cruel
,
treacherous
people
;
and
then
of
the
Spaniards
at
the
Philippines
,
more
false
,
more
cruel
,
more
treacherous
than
they
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
to
bring
this
long
turn
of
our
affair
to
a
conclusion
,
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
be
to
consult
with
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
and
with
the
man
,
and
know
if
they
be
willing
to
go
to
Japan
;
and
,
while
I
be
do
this
,
the
young
man
whom
,
as
I
say
,
my
nephew
have
leave
with
me
as
my
companion
for
my
travel
,
come
to
me
and
tell
me
that
he
think
that
voyage
promise
very
fair
,
and
that
there
be
a
great
prospect
of
advantage
,
and
he
would
be
very
glad
if
I
undertake
it
;
but
that
if
I
would
not
,
and
would
give
him
leave
,
he
would
go
as
a
merchant
,
or
how
I
please
to
order
him
;
and
if
ever
he
come
to
England
,
and
I
be
there
,
and
alive
,
he
would
render
me
a
faithful
account
of
his
success
,
and
it
should
be
as
much
mine
as
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
really
loath
to
part
with
him
;
but
consider
the
prospect
of
advantage
,
which
be
really
considerable
,
and
that
he
be
a
young
fellow
as
likely
to
do
well
in
it
as
any
I
know
<EOS>
,
I
incline
to
let
him
go
;
but
first
I
tell
him
,
I
would
consult
my
partner
,
and
give
him
an
answer
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
My
partner
and
I
discourse
about
it
,
and
my
partner
make
a
most
generous
offer
<EOS>
:
he
tell
me
,
"
You
know
it
have
be
an
unlucky
ship
,
and
we
both
resolve
not
to
go
to
sea
in
it
again
;
if
your
steward
(
so
he
call
my
man
)
will
venture
the
voyage
,
I
will
leave
my
share
of
the
vessel
to
him
,
and
let
him
make
the
good
of
it
;
and
if
we
live
to
meet
in
England
,
and
he
meet
with
success
abroad
,
he
shall
account
for
one
half
of
the
profit
of
the
ship
's
freight
to
us
,
the
other
shall
be
his
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
if
my
partner
,
who
be
no
way
concerned
with
my
young
man
,
make
him
such
an
offer
,
I
could
do
no
less
than
offer
him
the
same
;
and
all
the
ship
's
company
be
willing
to
go
with
him
,
we
make
over
half
the
ship
to
him
in
property
,
and
take
a
writing
from
him
,
oblige
him
to
account
for
the
other
;
and
away
he
go
to
Japan
.
<EOS>
the
Japan
merchant
prove
a
very
punctual
honest
man
to
him
,
protect
him
at
Japan
,
and
get
him
a
licence
to
come
on
shore
,
which
the
Europeans
in
general
have
not
lately
obtain
,
pay
him
his
freight
very
punctually
,
send
him
to
the
Philippines
,
load
him
with
Japan
and
China
ware
,
and
a
supercargo
of
their
own
,
who
traffic
with
the
Spaniards
,
bring
back
european
good
again
,
and
a
great
quantity
of
clove
and
other
spice
;
and
there
he
be
not
only
pay
his
freight
very
well
,
and
at
a
very
good
price
,
but
be
not
willing
to
sell
the
ship
then
,
the
merchant
furnish
him
with
good
on
his
own
account
;
that
for
some
money
and
some
spice
of
his
own
,
which
he
bring
with
him
,
he
go
back
to
the
Manillas
,
to
the
Spaniards
,
where
he
sell
his
cargo
very
well
.
<EOS>
here
,
have
get
a
good
acquaintance
at
Manilla
,
he
get
his
ship
make
a
free
ship
;
and
the
governor
of
Manilla
hire
him
to
go
to
Acapulco
in
America
,
on
the
coast
of
Mexico
;
and
give
him
a
licence
to
land
there
,
and
travel
to
Mexico
;
and
to
pass
in
any
spanish
ship
to
Europe
,
with
all
his
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
the
voyage
to
Acapulco
very
happily
,
and
there
he
sell
his
ship
;
and
have
there
also
obtain
allowance
to
travel
by
land
to
Porto
Bello
<EOS>
,
he
find
mean
,
some
how
or
other
,
to
go
to
Jamaica
with
all
his
treasure
;
and
about
eight
year
after
come
to
England
,
exceed
rich
;
of
which
I
shall
take
notice
in
its
place
;
in
the
mean
time
,
I
return
to
our
particular
affair
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
to
part
with
the
ship
and
ship
's
company
,
it
come
before
us
,
of
course
,
to
consider
what
recompense
we
should
give
to
the
two
man
that
give
us
such
timely
notice
of
the
design
against
us
in
the
river
of
Cambodia
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
they
have
do
us
a
considerable
service
,
and
deserve
well
at
our
hand
;
though
,
by
the
way
,
they
be
a
couple
of
rogue
too
:
for
,
as
they
believe
the
story
of
our
be
pirate
,
and
that
we
have
really
run
away
with
the
ship
,
they
come
down
to
us
,
not
only
to
betray
the
design
that
be
form
against
us
,
but
to
go
to
sea
with
us
as
pirate
;
and
one
of
them
confess
afterwards
,
that
nothing
else
but
the
hope
of
go
a
-
roguing
bring
him
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
service
they
do
us
be
not
the
less
;
and
therefore
,
as
I
have
promise
to
be
grateful
to
them
,
I
first
order
the
money
to
be
pay
to
them
,
which
they
say
be
due
to
them
on
board
their
respective
ship
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
Englishman
nineteen
month
pay
,
and
to
the
Dutchman
seven
;
and
,
over
and
above
that
,
I
give
each
of
them
a
small
sum
of
money
in
gold
,
which
content
them
very
well
:
then
I
make
the
Englishman
gunner
of
the
ship
,
the
gunner
be
now
make
second
mate
and
purser
;
the
Dutchman
I
make
boatswain
:
so
they
be
both
very
well
pleased
,
and
prove
very
serviceable
,
be
both
able
seaman
,
and
very
stout
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
on
shore
in
China
.
<EOS>
if
I
think
myself
banish
,
and
remote
from
my
own
country
at
Bengal
,
where
I
have
many
way
to
get
home
for
my
money
,
what
could
I
think
of
myself
now
,
when
I
be
get
about
a
thousand
league
farther
off
from
home
,
and
perfectly
destitute
of
all
manner
of
prospect
of
return
!
  
<EOS>
all
we
have
for
it
be
this
,
that
in
about
four
month
time
there
be
to
be
another
fair
at
that
place
where
we
be
,
and
then
we
may
be
able
to
purchase
all
sort
of
the
manufacture
of
the
country
,
and
withal
may
possibly
find
some
chinese
junk
or
vessel
from
Nanquin
,
that
would
be
to
be
sell
,
and
would
carry
us
and
our
good
whither
we
please
.
<EOS>
this
I
like
very
well
,
and
resolve
to
wait
;
besides
,
as
our
particular
person
be
not
obnoxious
,
so
if
any
english
or
dutch
ship
come
thither
,
perhaps
we
may
have
an
opportunity
to
load
our
good
,
and
get
passage
to
some
other
place
in
India
nearer
home
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
hope
we
resolve
to
continue
here
;
but
,
to
divert
ourselves
,
we
take
two
or
three
journie
into
the
country
;
first
,
we
go
ten
day
journey
to
see
the
city
of
Nanquin
,
a
city
well
worth
see
indeed
:
they
say
it
have
a
million
of
people
in
it
;
which
,
however
,
I
do
not
believe
:
it
be
regularly
build
,
the
street
all
exactly
straight
,
and
cross
one
another
in
direct
line
,
which
give
the
figure
of
it
great
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
to
compare
the
miserable
people
of
these
country
with
our
;
their
fabric
,
their
manner
of
living
,
their
government
,
their
religion
,
their
wealth
,
and
their
glory
,
(
as
some
call
it
)
I
must
confess
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
so
much
as
think
it
worth
name
,
or
worth
my
while
to
write
of
,
or
any
that
shall
come
after
me
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
observable
,
that
we
wonder
at
the
grandeur
,
the
rich
,
the
pomp
,
the
ceremony
,
the
government
,
the
manufacture
,
the
commerce
,
and
the
conduct
of
these
people
;
not
that
they
be
to
be
wonder
at
,
or
,
indeed
,
in
the
least
to
be
regard
;
but
because
,
have
first
a
notion
of
the
barbarity
of
those
country
,
the
rudeness
and
the
ignorance
that
prevail
there
,
we
do
not
expect
to
find
any
such
thing
so
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
otherwise
,
what
be
their
building
to
the
palace
and
royal
building
of
Europe
?
<EOS>
what
their
trade
to
the
universal
commerce
of
England
,
Holland
,
France
,
and
Spain
?
<EOS>
what
their
city
to
ours
,
for
wealth
,
strength
,
gaiety
of
apparel
,
rich
furniture
,
and
an
infinite
variety
?
<EOS>
what
be
their
port
,
supply
with
a
few
junk
and
bark
,
to
our
navigation
,
our
merchant
'
fleet
,
our
large
and
powerful
navy
?
<EOS>
Our
city
of
London
have
more
trade
than
all
their
mighty
empire
.
<EOS>
one
English
,
or
dutch
,
or
french
man
of
war
of
eighty
gun
,
would
fight
with
and
destroy
all
the
shipping
of
China
.
<EOS>
but
the
greatness
of
their
wealth
,
their
trade
,
the
power
of
their
government
,
and
strength
of
their
army
be
surprising
to
us
,
because
,
as
I
have
say
,
consider
them
as
a
barbarous
nation
of
pagan
,
little
well
than
savage
,
we
do
not
expect
such
thing
among
them
;
and
this
,
indeed
,
be
the
advantage
with
which
all
their
greatness
and
power
be
represent
to
us
:
otherwise
,
it
be
in
itself
nothing
at
all
;
for
,
as
I
have
say
of
their
ship
,
so
it
may
be
say
of
their
army
and
troop
;
all
the
force
of
their
empire
,
though
they
be
to
bring
two
million
of
man
into
the
field
together
,
would
be
able
to
do
nothing
but
ruin
the
country
and
starve
themselves
.
<EOS>
if
they
be
to
besiege
a
strong
town
in
Flanders
,
or
to
fight
a
disciplined
army
,
one
line
of
german
cuirassier
,
or
of
french
cavalry
,
would
overthrow
all
the
horse
of
China
;
a
million
of
their
foot
could
not
stand
before
one
embattle
body
of
our
infantry
,
post
so
as
not
to
be
surround
,
though
they
be
not
to
be
one
to
twenty
in
number
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
do
not
boast
if
I
say
,
that
30,000
german
or
english
foot
,
and
10,000
french
horse
,
would
fairly
beat
all
the
force
of
China
.
<EOS>
and
so
of
our
fortify
town
,
and
of
the
art
of
our
engineer
,
in
assault
and
defend
town
;
there
be
not
a
fortified
town
in
China
could
hold
out
one
month
against
the
battery
and
attack
of
an
european
army
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
all
the
army
of
China
could
never
take
such
a
town
as
Dunkirk
,
provide
it
be
not
starve
;
no
,
not
in
ten
year
siege
.
<EOS>
They
have
fire
-
arm
,
it
be
true
,
but
they
be
awkward
,
clumsy
,
and
uncertain
in
go
off
;
they
have
powder
,
but
it
be
of
no
strength
;
they
have
neither
discipline
in
the
field
,
exercise
in
their
arm
,
skill
to
attack
,
nor
temper
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
and
therefore
I
must
confess
it
seem
strange
to
me
when
I
come
home
,
and
hear
our
people
say
such
fine
thing
of
the
power
,
rich
,
glory
,
magnificence
,
and
trade
of
the
Chinese
,
because
I
see
and
know
that
they
be
a
contemptible
herd
or
crowd
of
ignorant
,
sordid
slave
,
subject
to
a
government
qualify
only
to
rule
such
a
people
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
for
I
be
now
launch
quite
beside
my
design
,
I
say
,
in
a
word
,
be
not
its
distance
inconceivably
great
from
Muscovy
,
and
be
not
the
Muscovite
empire
almost
as
rude
,
impotent
,
and
ill
-
govern
a
crowd
of
slave
as
they
,
the
czar
of
Muscovy
may
,
with
much
ease
,
drive
them
all
out
of
their
country
,
and
conquer
them
in
one
campaign
;
and
have
the
czar
,
who
I
since
hear
be
a
grow
prince
,
and
begin
to
appear
formidable
in
the
world
,
fall
this
way
,
instead
of
attack
the
warlike
Swedes
,
in
which
attempt
none
of
the
power
of
Europe
would
have
envy
or
interrupt
him
;
he
may
,
by
this
time
,
have
be
emperor
of
China
,
instead
of
be
beat
by
the
king
of
Sweden
at
Narva
,
when
the
latter
be
not
one
to
six
in
number
.
<EOS>
as
their
strength
and
their
grandeur
,
so
their
navigation
,
commerce
,
and
husbandry
,
be
imperfect
and
impotent
,
compare
to
the
same
thing
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
also
,
in
their
knowledge
,
their
learning
,
their
skill
in
the
science
;
they
have
globe
and
sphere
,
and
a
smatch
of
the
knowledge
of
the
mathematic
;
but
when
you
come
to
inquire
into
their
knowledge
,
how
short
-
sighted
be
the
wise
of
their
student
!
<EOS>
They
know
nothing
of
the
motion
of
the
heavenly
body
;
and
so
grossly
,
absurdly
ignorant
,
that
when
the
sun
be
eclipse
,
they
think
it
be
a
great
dragon
have
assault
and
run
away
with
it
;
and
they
fall
a
-
cluttering
with
all
the
drum
and
kettle
in
the
country
,
to
fright
the
monster
away
,
just
as
we
do
to
hive
a
swarm
of
bee
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
the
only
excursion
of
this
kind
which
I
have
make
in
all
the
account
I
have
give
of
my
travel
,
so
I
shall
make
no
more
description
of
country
and
people
:
it
be
none
of
my
business
,
or
any
part
of
my
design
;
but
give
an
account
of
my
own
adventure
,
through
a
life
of
infinite
wandering
,
and
a
long
variety
of
change
,
which
,
perhaps
,
few
have
hear
the
like
of
,
I
shall
say
nothing
of
the
mighty
place
,
desert
country
,
and
numerous
people
,
I
have
yet
to
pass
through
,
more
than
relate
to
my
own
story
,
and
which
my
concern
among
them
will
make
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
,
as
near
as
I
can
compute
,
in
the
heart
of
China
,
about
the
latitude
of
thirty
degree
north
of
the
line
,
for
we
be
return
from
Nanquin
;
I
have
indeed
a
mind
to
see
the
city
of
Pekin
,
which
I
have
hear
so
much
of
,
and
Father
Simon
importune
me
daily
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
at
length
his
time
of
go
away
be
set
,
and
the
other
missionary
,
who
be
to
go
with
him
,
be
arrive
from
Macao
,
it
be
necessary
that
we
should
resolve
either
to
go
,
or
not
to
go
;
so
I
refer
him
to
my
partner
,
and
leave
it
wholly
to
his
choice
;
who
at
length
resolve
it
in
the
affirmative
;
and
we
prepare
for
our
journey
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
with
very
good
advantage
,
as
to
find
the
way
;
for
we
get
leave
to
travel
in
the
retinue
of
one
of
their
mandarin
,
a
kind
of
viceroy
,
or
principal
magistrate
,
in
the
province
where
they
reside
,
and
who
take
great
state
upon
them
,
travel
with
great
attendance
,
and
with
great
homage
from
the
people
,
who
be
sometimes
greatly
impoverished
by
them
,
because
all
the
country
they
pass
through
be
oblige
to
furnish
provision
for
them
,
and
all
their
attendant
.
<EOS>
that
which
I
particularly
observe
,
as
to
our
travelling
with
his
baggage
,
be
this
;
that
though
we
receive
sufficient
provision
,
both
for
ourselves
and
our
horse
,
from
the
country
,
as
belong
to
the
mandarin
,
yet
we
be
oblige
to
pay
for
every
thing
we
have
after
the
market
-
price
of
the
country
,
and
the
mandarin
's
steward
,
or
commissary
of
the
provision
,
collect
it
duly
from
us
;
so
that
our
travelling
in
the
retinue
of
the
mandarin
,
though
it
be
a
very
great
kindness
to
us
,
be
not
such
a
mighty
favour
in
him
,
but
be
,
indeed
,
a
great
advantage
to
him
,
consider
there
be
about
thirty
other
people
travel
in
the
same
manner
besides
us
,
under
the
protection
of
his
retinue
,
or
,
as
we
may
call
it
,
under
his
convoy
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
be
a
great
advantage
to
him
;
for
the
country
furnish
all
the
provision
for
nothing
,
and
he
take
all
our
money
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
day
travel
to
Pekin
,
through
a
country
infinitely
populous
,
but
miserably
cultivate
;
the
husbandry
,
economy
,
and
the
way
of
living
,
all
very
miserable
,
though
they
boast
so
much
of
the
industry
of
the
people
:
I
say
miserable
;
and
so
it
be
;
if
we
,
who
understand
how
to
live
,
be
to
endure
it
,
or
to
compare
it
with
our
own
;
but
not
so
to
these
poor
wretch
,
who
know
no
other
.
<EOS>
the
pride
of
these
people
be
infinitely
great
,
and
exceed
by
nothing
but
their
poverty
,
which
add
to
that
which
I
call
their
misery
.
<EOS>
I
must
need
think
the
naked
savage
of
America
live
much
more
happy
,
because
,
as
they
have
nothing
,
so
they
desire
nothing
;
whereas
these
be
proud
and
insolent
,
and
,
in
the
main
,
be
mere
beggar
and
drudge
;
their
ostentation
be
inexpressible
,
and
be
chiefly
shew
in
their
clothe
and
building
,
and
in
the
keep
multitude
of
servant
or
slave
,
and
,
which
be
to
the
last
degree
ridiculous
,
their
contempt
of
all
the
world
but
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
I
travel
more
pleasantly
afterwards
,
in
the
desert
and
vast
wilderness
of
Grand
Tartary
,
than
here
;
and
yet
the
road
here
be
well
pave
and
well
keep
,
and
very
convenient
for
traveller
:
but
nothing
be
more
awkward
to
me
,
than
to
see
such
a
haughty
,
imperious
,
insolent
people
<EOS>
,
in
the
midst
of
the
gross
simplicity
and
ignorance
;
for
all
their
famed
ingenuity
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Father
Simon
,
and
I
,
use
to
be
very
merry
upon
these
occasion
,
to
see
the
beggarly
pride
of
those
people
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
come
by
the
house
of
a
country
-
gentleman
,
as
Father
Simon
call
him
,
about
ten
league
off
from
the
city
of
Nanquin
,
we
have
,
first
of
all
,
the
honour
to
ride
with
the
master
of
the
house
about
two
mile
;
the
state
he
ride
in
be
a
perfect
Don
Quixotism
,
be
a
mixture
of
pomp
and
poverty
.
  
<EOS>
the
habit
of
this
greasy
<EOS>
Don
be
very
proper
for
a
scaramouch
,
or
merry
-
andrew
;
be
a
dirty
calico
,
with
all
the
tawdry
trapping
of
a
fool
's
coat
,
such
as
hang
sleeve
,
taffety
,
and
cut
and
slash
almost
on
every
side
<EOS>
:
it
cover
a
rich
taffety
vest
,
as
greasy
as
a
butcher
,
and
which
testify
,
that
his
honour
must
needs
be
a
most
exquisite
sloven
.
  
<EOS>
His
horse
be
a
poor
,
lean
,
starve
,
hobble
<EOS>
creature
,
such
as
in
England
may
sell
for
about
thirty
or
forty
shilling
;
and
he
have
two
slave
follow
him
on
foot
,
to
drive
the
poor
creature
along
<EOS>
:
he
have
a
whip
in
his
hand
,
and
he
belabour
the
beast
as
fast
about
the
head
as
his
slave
do
about
the
tail
;
and
thus
he
ride
by
us
with
about
ten
or
twelve
servant
;
and
we
be
tell
he
be
go
from
the
city
to
his
country
-
seat
,
about
half
a
league
before
us
.
<EOS>
We
travel
on
gently
,
but
this
figure
of
a
gentleman
ride
away
before
us
;
and
as
we
stop
at
a
village
about
an
hour
to
refresh
us
,
when
we
come
by
the
country
-
seat
of
this
great
man
,
we
see
him
in
a
little
place
before
his
door
,
eat
his
repast
;
it
be
a
kind
of
a
garden
,
but
he
be
easy
to
be
see
;
and
we
be
give
to
understand
,
that
the
more
we
look
on
him
,
the
well
he
would
be
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
under
a
tree
,
something
like
the
palmetto
-
tree
,
which
effectually
shade
him
over
the
head
,
and
on
the
south
side
;
but
under
the
tree
also
be
place
a
large
umbrella
,
which
make
that
part
look
well
enough
:
he
sit
loll
back
in
a
great
elbow
-
chair
,
be
a
heavy
corpulent
man
,
and
his
meat
be
bring
him
by
two
woman
-
slave
:
he
have
two
more
,
whose
office
,
I
think
,
few
gentleman
in
Europe
would
accept
of
their
service
in
,
viz
.
<EOS>
one
feed
the
squire
with
a
spoon
,
and
the
other
hold
the
dish
with
one
hand
,
and
scrape
off
what
he
let
fall
upon
his
worship
's
beard
and
taffety
vest
,
with
the
other
;
while
the
great
fat
brute
think
it
below
him
to
employ
his
own
hand
in
any
of
those
familiar
office
,
which
king
and
monarchs
would
rather
do
than
be
trouble
with
the
clumsy
finger
of
their
servant
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
this
time
to
think
what
pain
man
's
pride
put
them
to
,
and
how
troublesome
a
haughty
temper
,
thus
ill
-
managed
,
must
be
to
a
man
of
common
sense
;
and
,
leave
the
poor
wretch
to
please
himself
with
our
look
at
him
,
as
if
we
admire
his
pomp
,
whereas
we
really
pity
and
contemn
him
,
we
pursue
our
journey
:
only
Father
Simon
have
the
curiosity
to
stay
to
inform
himself
what
daintie
the
country
justice
have
to
feed
on
,
in
all
his
state
;
which
he
say
he
have
the
honour
to
taste
of
,
and
which
be
,
I
think
,
a
dose
that
an
English
hound
would
scarce
have
eat
,
if
it
have
be
offer
him
,
viz
.
<EOS>
a
mess
of
boil
rice
,
with
a
great
piece
of
garlick
in
it
,
and
a
little
bag
fill
with
green
pepper
,
and
another
plant
which
they
have
there
,
something
like
our
ginger
,
but
smell
like
musk
and
taste
like
mustard
:
all
this
be
put
together
,
and
a
small
lump
or
piece
of
lean
mutton
boil
in
it
;
and
this
be
his
worship
's
repast
,
four
or
five
servant
more
attend
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
if
he
feed
them
mean
than
he
be
feed
himself
,
the
spice
except
,
they
must
fare
very
coarsely
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
our
mandarin
with
whom
we
travel
,
he
be
respect
like
a
king
;
surround
always
with
his
gentleman
,
and
attend
in
all
his
appearance
with
such
pomp
,
that
I
see
little
of
him
but
at
a
distance
;
but
this
I
observe
,
that
there
be
not
a
horse
in
his
retinue
,
but
that
our
carrier
'
pack
-
horse
in
England
seem
to
me
to
look
much
well
;
but
they
be
so
covered
with
equipage
,
mantle
,
trapping
,
and
such
-
like
trumpery
,
that
you
can
not
see
whether
they
be
fat
or
lean
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
could
scarce
see
any
thing
but
their
foot
and
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
light
-
hearted
,
and
all
my
trouble
and
perplexity
that
I
have
give
an
account
of
be
over
,
I
have
no
anxious
thought
about
me
;
which
make
this
journey
much
the
pleasanter
to
me
;
nor
have
I
any
ill
accident
attend
me
,
only
in
the
passing
or
ford
a
small
river
,
my
horse
fall
,
and
make
me
free
of
the
country
,
as
they
call
it
;
that
be
to
say
,
throw
me
in
:
<EOS>
the
place
be
not
deep
,
but
it
wet
me
all
over
:
I
mention
it
,
because
it
spoil
my
pocket
-
book
,
wherein
I
have
set
down
the
name
of
several
people
and
place
which
I
have
occasion
to
remember
,
and
which
not
take
due
care
of
,
the
leave
rot
,
and
the
word
be
never
after
to
be
read
,
to
my
great
loss
,
as
to
the
name
of
some
place
which
I
touch
at
in
this
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
we
arrive
at
Pekin
;
I
have
nobody
with
me
but
the
youth
,
whom
my
nephew
the
captain
have
give
me
to
attend
me
as
a
servant
,
and
who
prove
very
trusty
and
diligent
;
and
my
partner
have
nobody
with
him
but
one
servant
,
who
be
a
kinsman
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
portuguese
pilot
,
he
be
desirous
to
see
the
court
,
we
give
him
his
passage
,
that
be
to
say
,
bore
his
charge
for
his
company
;
and
to
use
him
as
an
interpreter
,
for
he
understand
the
language
of
the
country
,
and
speak
good
French
and
a
little
English
;
and
,
indeed
,
this
old
man
be
a
most
useful
implement
to
us
<EOS>
every
where
;
for
we
have
not
be
above
a
week
at
Pekin
,
when
he
come
laugh
:
"
ah
,
Seignior
Inglese
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
will
make
your
heart
glad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
glad
,
"
say
I
;
<EOS>
"
what
can
that
be
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
any
thing
in
this
country
can
either
give
me
joy
or
grief
,
to
any
great
degree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
in
broken
English
,
"
make
you
glad
,
me
sorrow
;
"
sorry
,
he
would
have
say
.
<EOS>
this
make
me
more
inquisitive
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
will
it
make
you
sorry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
have
bring
me
here
twenty
-
five
day
journey
,
and
will
leave
me
to
go
back
alone
;
and
which
way
shall
I
get
to
my
port
afterwards
,
without
a
ship
,
without
a
horse
,
without
pecune
?
"
<EOS>
so
he
call
money
;
be
his
break
Latin
,
of
which
he
have
abundance
to
make
us
merry
with
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
tell
us
there
be
a
great
caravan
of
Muscovy
and
polish
merchant
in
the
city
,
and
that
they
be
prepare
to
set
out
on
their
journey
,
by
land
,
to
Muscovy
,
within
four
or
five
week
,
and
he
be
sure
we
would
take
the
opportunity
to
go
with
them
,
and
leave
him
behind
to
go
back
alone
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
surprised
with
this
news
:
a
secret
joy
spread
itself
over
my
whole
soul
,
which
I
can
not
describe
,
and
never
feel
before
or
since
;
and
I
have
no
power
,
for
a
good
while
,
to
speak
a
word
to
the
old
man
;
but
at
last
I
turn
to
him
:
"
how
do
you
know
this
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
:
<EOS>
"
be
you
sure
it
be
true
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
meet
this
morning
in
the
street
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
an
Armenian
,
or
one
you
call
a
Grecian
,
who
be
among
them
;
he
come
last
from
Astracan
,
and
be
design
to
go
to
Tonquin
;
where
I
formerly
know
him
,
but
have
alter
his
mind
,
and
be
now
resolve
to
go
back
with
the
caravan
to
Moscow
,
and
so
down
the
river
of
Wolga
to
Astracan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Seignior
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
not
be
uneasy
about
be
leave
to
go
back
alone
;
if
this
be
a
method
for
my
return
to
England
,
it
shall
be
your
fault
if
you
go
back
to
Macao
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
We
then
go
to
consult
together
what
be
to
be
do
,
and
I
ask
my
partner
what
he
think
of
the
pilot
's
news
,
and
whether
it
would
suit
with
his
affair
:
he
tell
me
he
would
do
just
as
I
would
;
for
he
have
settle
all
his
affair
so
well
at
Bengal
,
and
leave
his
effect
in
such
good
hand
,
that
as
we
make
a
good
voyage
here
,
if
he
could
vest
it
in
China
silk
,
work
and
raw
,
such
as
may
be
worth
the
carriage
,
he
would
be
content
to
go
to
England
,
and
then
make
his
voyage
back
to
Bengal
by
the
company
's
ship
.
  
<EOS>
have
resolve
upon
this
,
we
agree
,
that
,
if
our
portuguese
pilot
would
go
with
us
,
we
would
bear
his
charge
to
Moscow
,
or
to
England
,
if
he
please
;
nor
,
indeed
,
be
we
to
be
esteem
over
-
generous
in
that
part
<EOS>
neither
,
if
we
have
not
reward
him
farther
;
for
the
service
he
have
do
us
be
really
worth
all
that
,
and
more
;
for
he
have
not
only
be
a
pilot
to
us
at
sea
,
but
he
have
be
also
like
a
broker
for
us
on
shore
;
and
his
procuring
for
us
the
Japan
merchant
be
some
hundred
of
pound
in
our
pocket
.
<EOS>
so
we
consult
together
about
it
;
and
,
be
willing
to
gratify
him
,
which
be
,
indeed
,
but
do
him
justice
,
and
very
willing
also
to
have
him
with
us
besides
,
for
he
be
a
most
necessary
man
on
all
occasion
<EOS>
,
we
agree
to
give
him
a
quantity
of
coin
gold
,
which
,
as
I
compute
it
,
come
to
about
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
pound
sterling
between
us
,
and
to
bear
his
charge
,
both
for
himself
and
horse
,
except
only
a
horse
to
carry
his
good
.
  
<EOS>
have
settle
this
among
ourselves
,
we
call
him
to
let
him
know
what
we
have
resolve
:
I
tell
him
,
he
have
complain
of
our
be
like
to
let
him
go
back
alone
,
and
I
be
now
to
tell
him
we
be
resolve
he
should
not
go
back
at
all
:
that
as
we
have
resolve
to
go
to
Europe
with
the
caravan
,
we
resolve
also
he
should
go
with
us
,
and
that
we
call
him
to
know
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
,
and
say
it
be
a
long
journey
,
and
he
have
no
pecune
to
carry
him
thith
,
nor
to
subsist
himself
when
he
come
thither
.
<EOS>
We
tell
him
,
we
believe
it
be
so
,
and
therefore
we
have
resolve
to
do
something
for
him
,
that
would
let
him
see
how
sensible
we
be
of
the
service
he
have
do
us
;
and
also
how
agreeable
he
be
to
us
;
and
then
I
tell
him
what
we
have
resolve
to
give
him
here
,
which
he
may
lay
out
as
we
would
do
our
own
;
and
that
as
for
his
charge
,
if
he
would
go
with
us
,
we
would
set
him
safe
ashore
(
life
and
casualty
except
)
,
either
in
Muscovy
or
in
England
,
which
he
would
,
at
our
own
charge
,
except
only
the
carriage
of
his
good
.
  
<EOS>
He
receive
the
proposal
like
a
man
transport
,
and
tell
us
,
he
would
go
with
us
over
the
whole
world
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
in
short
,
we
all
prepare
ourselves
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
it
be
with
us
,
so
it
be
with
the
other
merchant
,
they
have
many
thing
to
do
;
and
instead
of
be
ready
in
five
week
,
it
be
four
month
and
some
odd
day
before
all
thing
be
get
together
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
beginning
of
February
,
our
style
,
when
we
set
out
from
Pekin
.
<EOS>
My
partner
and
the
old
pilot
have
go
express
back
to
the
port
where
we
have
first
put
in
,
to
dispose
of
some
good
which
he
have
leave
there
;
and
I
,
with
a
chinese
merchant
,
whom
I
have
some
knowledge
of
at
Nanquin
,
and
who
come
to
Pekin
on
his
own
affair
,
go
to
Nanquin
,
where
I
buy
ninety
piece
of
fine
damask
,
with
about
two
hundred
piece
of
other
very
fine
silk
,
of
several
sort
,
some
mixed
with
gold
,
and
have
all
these
bring
to
Pekin
against
my
partner
's
return
:
besides
this
,
we
buy
a
very
large
quantity
of
raw
silk
,
and
some
other
good
;
our
cargo
amount
,
in
these
good
only
,
to
about
three
thousand
five
hundred
pound
sterling
,
which
,
together
with
tea
,
and
some
fine
calico
,
and
three
camel
-
load
of
nutmeg
and
clove
,
load
in
all
eighteen
camel
for
our
share
,
besides
those
we
ride
upon
;
which
,
with
two
or
three
spare
horse
,
and
two
horse
load
with
provision
,
make
us
,
in
short
,
twenty
-
six
camel
and
horse
in
our
retinue
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
be
very
great
,
and
,
as
near
as
I
can
remember
,
make
between
three
and
four
hundred
horse
and
camel
,
and
upward
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
man
,
very
well
armed
,
and
provide
for
all
event
.
<EOS>
for
,
as
the
eastern
caravan
be
subject
to
be
attack
by
the
Arabs
,
so
be
these
by
the
Tartars
;
but
they
be
not
altogether
so
dangerous
as
the
Arabs
,
nor
so
barbarous
when
they
prevail
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
consist
of
people
of
several
nation
,
such
as
Muscovites
chiefly
;
for
there
be
about
sixty
of
them
who
be
merchant
or
inhabitant
of
Moscow
,
though
of
them
some
be
Livonians
;
and
to
our
particular
satisfaction
,
five
of
them
be
scot
,
who
appear
also
to
be
man
of
great
experience
in
business
,
and
very
good
substance
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
travel
one
day
's
journey
,
the
guide
,
who
be
five
in
number
,
call
all
the
gentleman
and
merchant
,
that
be
to
say
,
all
the
passenger
,
except
the
servant
,
to
a
great
council
,
as
they
term
it
.
<EOS>
at
this
great
council
every
one
deposit
a
certain
quantity
of
money
to
a
common
stock
,
for
the
necessary
expense
of
buy
forage
on
the
way
where
it
be
not
otherwise
to
be
have
,
and
for
satisfy
the
guide
,
get
horse
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
and
here
they
constitute
the
journey
,
as
they
call
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
they
name
captain
and
officer
to
draw
us
all
up
and
give
the
command
in
case
of
an
attack
;
and
give
every
one
their
turn
of
command
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
form
us
into
order
any
more
than
what
we
find
needful
upon
the
way
,
as
shall
be
observe
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
road
all
on
this
side
of
the
country
be
very
populous
,
and
be
full
of
potter
and
earth
maker
;
that
be
to
say
,
people
that
temper
the
earth
for
the
China
ware
;
and
,
as
I
be
go
along
,
our
portuguese
pilot
,
who
have
always
something
or
other
to
say
to
make
us
merry
,
come
sneer
to
me
,
and
tell
me
,
he
would
shew
the
great
rarity
in
all
the
country
;
and
that
I
should
have
this
to
say
of
China
,
after
all
the
ill
humoured
thing
I
have
say
of
it
,
that
I
have
see
one
thing
which
be
not
to
be
see
in
all
the
world
beside
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
importunate
to
know
what
it
be
;
at
last
he
tell
me
,
it
be
a
gentleman
's
house
,
build
all
with
China
ware
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
not
the
material
of
their
building
the
product
of
their
own
country
;
and
so
it
be
all
China
ware
,
be
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
mean
,
it
be
a
house
all
make
of
China
ware
,
such
as
you
call
so
in
England
;
or
,
as
it
be
call
in
our
country
,
porcelain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
such
a
thing
may
be
:
how
big
be
it
?
<EOS>
can
we
carry
it
in
a
box
upon
a
camel
?
<EOS>
if
we
can
,
we
will
buy
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
a
camel
!
"
say
the
old
pilot
,
hold
up
both
his
hand
;
"
why
,
there
be
a
family
of
thirty
people
live
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
then
curious
,
indeed
,
to
see
it
;
and
when
I
come
to
see
it
,
it
be
nothing
but
this
:
it
be
a
timber
house
,
or
a
house
build
,
as
we
call
it
in
England
,
with
lath
and
plaster
,
but
all
the
plastering
be
really
China
ware
,
that
be
to
say
,
it
be
plaster
with
the
earth
that
make
China
ware
.
  
<EOS>
the
outside
,
which
the
sun
shine
hot
upon
,
be
glaze
,
and
look
very
well
,
perfectly
white
,
and
paint
with
blue
figure
,
as
the
large
China
ware
in
England
be
paint
,
and
hard
,
as
if
it
have
be
burn
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
inside
,
all
the
wall
,
instead
of
wainscot
,
be
line
with
harden
and
paint
tile
,
like
the
little
square
tile
we
call
gally
tile
in
England
,
all
make
of
the
fine
china
,
and
the
figure
exceed
fine
indeed
,
with
extraordinary
variety
of
colour
,
mix
with
gold
,
many
tile
make
but
one
figure
,
but
join
so
artificially
with
mortar
,
be
make
of
the
same
earth
,
that
it
be
very
hard
to
see
where
the
tile
meet
.
<EOS>
the
floor
of
the
room
be
of
the
same
composition
,
and
as
hard
as
the
earthen
floor
we
have
in
use
in
several
part
of
England
,
especially
Lincolnshire
,
Nottinghamshire
,
Leicestershire
,
&
c.
as
hard
as
stone
,
and
smooth
,
but
not
burn
and
paint
,
except
some
small
room
,
like
closet
,
which
be
all
,
as
it
be
,
pave
with
the
same
tile
:
<EOS>
the
ceiling
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
the
plastering
work
in
the
whole
house
,
be
of
the
same
earth
;
and
,
after
all
,
the
roof
be
cover
with
tile
of
the
same
,
but
of
a
deep
shine
black
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
china
warehouse
indeed
,
truly
and
lite
rally
to
be
call
so
;
and
have
I
not
be
upon
the
journey
,
I
could
have
staid
some
day
to
see
and
examine
the
particular
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
there
be
fountain
and
fish
-
pond
in
the
garden
,
all
pave
at
the
bottom
and
side
with
the
same
,
and
fine
statue
set
up
in
row
on
the
walk
,
entirely
form
of
the
porcelain
earth
,
and
burn
whole
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
one
of
the
singularity
of
China
,
so
they
may
be
allow
to
excel
in
it
;
but
I
be
very
sure
they
excel
in
their
account
of
it
;
for
they
tell
me
such
incredible
thing
of
their
performance
in
crockery
-
ware
,
for
such
it
be
,
that
I
care
not
to
relate
,
as
know
it
could
not
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
one
tell
me
,
in
particular
,
of
a
workman
that
make
a
ship
,
with
all
its
tackle
,
and
mast
,
and
sail
,
in
earthenware
,
big
enough
to
carry
fifty
man
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
tell
me
he
launch
it
,
and
make
a
voyage
to
Japan
in
it
,
I
may
have
say
something
to
it
indeed
;
but
as
it
be
,
I
know
the
whole
story
,
which
be
,
in
short
,
ask
pardon
for
the
word
,
that
the
fellow
lie
;
so
I
smile
,
and
say
nothing
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
odd
sight
keep
me
two
hour
behind
the
caravan
,
for
which
the
leader
of
it
for
the
day
fine
me
about
the
value
of
three
shilling
;
and
tell
me
,
if
it
have
be
three
day
journey
without
the
wall
,
as
it
be
three
day
within
,
he
must
have
fine
me
four
time
as
much
,
and
make
me
ask
pardon
the
next
council
-
day
:
<EOS>
so
I
promise
to
be
more
orderly
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
find
afterwards
the
order
make
for
keep
all
together
be
absolutely
necessary
for
our
common
safety
.
  
<EOS>
in
two
day
more
we
pass
the
great
China
wall
,
make
for
a
fortification
against
the
Tartars
;
and
a
very
great
work
it
be
,
go
over
hill
and
mountain
in
an
endless
track
,
where
the
rock
be
impassable
,
and
the
precipice
such
as
no
enemy
could
possibly
enter
,
or
,
indeed
,
climb
up
,
or
where
,
if
they
do
,
no
wall
could
hinder
them
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
,
its
length
be
near
a
thousand
english
mile
,
but
that
the
country
be
five
hundred
,
in
a
straight
measure
line
,
which
the
wall
bound
,
without
measure
the
winding
and
turning
it
take
:
'
<EOS>
tis
about
four
fathom
high
,
and
as
many
thick
in
some
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
still
an
hour
,
or
thereabout
,
without
trespass
on
our
order
,
for
so
long
the
caravan
be
in
pass
the
gate
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
I
stand
still
an
hour
to
look
at
it
,
on
every
side
,
near
and
far
off
;
I
mean
,
what
be
within
my
view
;
and
the
guide
of
our
caravan
,
who
have
be
extoll
it
for
the
wonder
of
the
world
,
be
mighty
eager
to
hear
my
opinion
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
it
be
a
most
excellent
thing
to
keep
off
the
Tartars
,
which
he
happen
not
to
understand
as
I
mean
it
,
and
so
take
it
for
a
compliment
;
but
the
old
pilot
laugh
:
"
o
,
Seignior
Inglese
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
speak
in
colour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
colour
!
"
say
I
;
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
speak
what
look
white
this
way
,
and
black
that
way
;
gay
one
way
,
and
dull
another
way
:
you
tell
him
it
be
a
good
wall
to
keep
out
tartar
;
you
tell
me
,
by
that
,
it
be
good
for
nothing
but
to
keep
out
Tartars
;
or
,
will
keep
out
none
but
tartar
.
<EOS>
I
understand
you
,
Seignior
Inglese
,
I
understand
you
,
"
say
he
,
joke
;
"
but
Seignior
Chinese
understand
you
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
Seignior
,
do
you
think
it
would
stand
out
an
army
of
our
country
-
people
,
with
a
good
train
of
artillery
;
or
our
engineer
,
with
two
company
of
miner
?
<EOS>
Would
they
not
batter
it
down
in
ten
day
,
that
an
army
may
enter
in
battalia
,
or
blow
it
up
in
the
air
,
foundation
and
all
,
that
there
should
be
no
sign
of
it
leave
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Chinese
want
mightily
to
know
what
I
say
,
and
I
give
him
leave
to
tell
him
a
few
day
after
,
for
we
be
then
almost
out
of
their
country
,
and
he
be
to
leave
us
in
a
little
time
afterwards
;
but
when
he
know
what
I
have
say
,
he
be
dumb
all
the
rest
of
the
way
,
and
we
hear
no
more
of
his
fine
story
of
the
chinese
power
and
greatness
while
he
staid
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
pass
this
mighty
nothing
,
call
a
wall
,
something
like
the
pict
wall
,
so
famous
in
Northumberland
,
and
build
by
the
Romans
,
we
begin
to
find
the
country
thinly
inhabit
,
and
the
people
rather
confine
to
live
in
fortified
town
and
city
,
as
be
subject
to
the
inroad
and
depredation
of
the
Tartars
,
who
rob
in
great
army
,
and
therefore
be
not
to
be
resist
by
the
naked
inhabitant
of
an
open
country
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
begin
to
find
the
necessity
of
keep
together
in
a
caravan
,
as
we
travel
;
for
we
see
several
troop
of
tartar
rove
about
;
but
when
I
come
to
see
them
distinctly
,
I
wonder
how
that
the
chinese
empire
could
be
conquer
by
such
contemptible
fellow
;
for
they
be
a
mere
herd
or
crowd
of
wild
fellow
,
keep
no
order
,
and
understand
no
discipline
,
or
manner
of
fight
.
  
<EOS>
Their
horse
be
poor
,
lean
,
starved
creature
,
teach
nothing
,
and
be
fit
for
nothing
;
and
this
we
find
the
first
day
we
see
them
,
which
be
after
we
enter
the
wild
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Our
leader
for
the
day
give
leave
for
about
sixteen
of
us
to
go
a
hunting
,
as
they
call
it
;
and
what
be
this
but
hunting
of
sheep
!
<EOS>
however
,
it
may
be
call
hunt
too
;
for
the
creature
be
the
wild
,
and
swift
of
foot
,
that
ever
I
see
of
their
kind
;
only
they
will
not
run
a
great
way
,
and
you
be
sure
of
sport
when
you
begin
the
chase
;
for
they
appear
generally
by
thirty
or
forty
in
a
flock
,
and
,
like
true
sheep
,
always
keep
together
when
they
fly
.
  
<EOS>
in
pursuit
of
this
odd
sort
of
game
,
it
be
our
hap
to
meet
with
about
forty
tartar
:
whether
they
be
hunt
mutton
as
we
be
,
or
whether
they
look
for
another
kind
of
prey
,
I
know
not
;
but
as
soon
as
they
see
us
,
one
of
them
blow
a
kind
of
horn
very
loud
,
but
with
a
barbarous
sound
that
I
have
never
hear
before
,
and
,
by
the
way
,
never
care
to
hear
again
.
<EOS>
We
all
suppose
this
be
to
call
their
friend
about
them
;
and
so
it
be
;
for
in
less
than
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
a
troop
of
forty
or
fifty
more
appear
at
about
a
mile
distance
;
but
our
work
be
over
first
,
as
it
happen
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
Scots
merchant
of
Moscow
happen
to
be
amongst
us
;
and
as
soon
as
he
hear
the
horn
,
he
tell
us
,
in
short
,
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
charge
them
immediately
,
without
loss
of
time
;
and
,
draw
us
up
in
a
line
,
he
ask
,
if
we
be
resolve
?
<EOS>
We
tell
him
,
we
be
ready
to
follow
him
:
so
he
ride
directly
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
stand
gaze
at
us
,
like
a
mere
crowd
,
draw
up
in
no
order
,
nor
shew
the
face
of
any
order
at
all
;
but
as
soon
as
they
see
us
advance
,
they
let
fly
their
arrow
;
which
,
however
,
miss
us
very
happily
:
it
seem
they
mistake
not
their
aim
,
but
their
distance
;
for
their
arrow
all
fall
a
little
short
of
us
,
but
with
so
true
an
aim
,
that
have
we
be
about
twenty
yard
near
,
we
must
have
have
several
man
wound
,
if
not
kill
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
we
halt
;
and
though
it
be
at
a
great
distance
,
we
fire
,
and
send
them
leaden
bullet
for
wooden
arrow
,
follow
our
shot
full
gallop
,
resolve
to
fall
in
among
them
sword
in
hand
;
for
so
our
bold
Scot
that
lead
us
,
direct
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
but
a
merchant
,
but
he
behave
with
that
vigour
and
bravery
on
this
occasion
,
and
yet
with
such
a
cool
courage
too
,
that
I
never
see
any
man
in
action
fitter
for
command
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
come
up
to
them
,
we
fire
our
pistol
in
their
face
,
and
then
draw
;
but
they
flee
in
the
great
confusion
imaginable
;
the
only
stand
any
of
them
make
be
on
our
right
,
where
three
of
them
stand
,
and
,
by
sign
,
call
the
rest
to
come
back
to
them
,
have
a
kind
of
scimitar
in
their
hand
,
and
their
bow
hang
at
their
back
.
<EOS>
Our
brave
commander
,
without
ask
any
body
to
follow
him
,
gallop
up
close
to
them
,
and
with
his
fusil
knock
one
of
them
off
his
horse
,
kill
the
second
with
his
pistol
,
and
the
third
run
away
;
and
thus
end
our
fight
;
but
we
have
this
misfortune
attend
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
all
our
mutton
that
we
have
in
chase
get
away
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
a
man
kill
or
hurt
;
but
,
as
for
the
Tartars
,
there
be
about
five
of
them
kill
;
how
many
be
wound
,
we
know
not
;
but
this
we
know
,
that
the
other
party
be
so
fright
with
the
noise
of
our
gun
,
that
they
flee
,
and
never
make
any
attempt
upon
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
this
while
in
the
chinese
dominion
,
and
therefore
the
Tartars
be
not
so
bold
as
afterwards
;
but
in
about
five
day
we
enter
a
vast
great
wild
desert
,
which
hold
us
three
day
and
night
march
;
and
we
be
oblige
to
carry
our
water
with
us
in
great
leather
bottle
,
and
to
encamp
all
night
,
just
as
I
have
hear
they
do
in
the
desert
of
Arabia
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
our
guide
,
whose
dominion
this
be
in
?
<EOS>
and
they
tell
me
this
be
a
kind
of
border
that
may
be
call
no
Man
's
land
;
be
part
of
the
Great
Karakathy
,
or
Grand
Tartary
;
but
that
,
however
,
it
be
reckon
to
China
;
that
there
be
no
care
take
here
to
preserve
it
from
the
inroad
of
thief
;
and
therefore
it
be
reckon
the
bad
desert
in
the
whole
march
,
though
we
be
to
go
over
some
much
large
.
  
<EOS>
in
pass
this
wilderness
,
which
,
I
confess
,
be
at
the
first
view
very
frightful
to
me
,
we
see
two
or
three
time
little
party
of
the
Tartars
,
but
they
seem
to
be
upon
their
own
affair
,
and
to
have
no
design
upon
us
;
and
so
,
like
the
man
who
meet
the
devil
,
if
they
have
nothing
to
say
to
us
,
we
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
;
we
let
them
go
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
however
,
a
party
of
them
come
so
near
as
to
stand
and
gaze
at
us
;
whether
it
be
to
consider
what
they
should
do
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
attack
us
,
or
not
attack
us
,
we
know
not
;
but
when
we
be
pass
at
some
distance
by
them
,
we
make
a
rear
guard
of
forty
man
,
and
stand
ready
for
them
,
let
the
caravan
pass
half
a
mile
,
or
thereabout
,
before
us
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
they
march
off
,
only
we
find
they
assault
us
with
five
arrow
at
their
parting
;
one
of
which
wound
a
horse
,
so
that
it
disable
him
;
and
we
leave
him
the
next
day
,
poor
creature
,
in
great
need
of
a
good
farrier
.
<EOS>
We
suppose
they
may
shoot
more
arrow
,
which
may
fall
short
of
us
;
but
we
see
no
more
arrow
,
or
tartar
,
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
We
travel
near
a
month
after
this
,
the
way
be
not
so
good
as
at
first
,
though
still
in
the
dominion
of
the
emperor
of
China
;
but
lie
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
village
,
some
of
which
be
fortify
,
because
of
the
incursion
of
the
Tartars
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
one
of
these
town
,
(
it
be
about
two
day
and
a
half
's
journey
before
we
be
to
come
to
the
city
of
Naum
)
<EOS>
I
want
to
buy
a
camel
,
of
which
there
be
plenty
to
be
sell
all
the
way
upon
that
road
,
and
of
horse
also
,
such
as
they
be
,
because
so
many
caravan
come
that
way
,
they
be
very
often
want
.
<EOS>
the
person
that
I
speak
to
to
get
me
a
camel
,
would
have
go
and
fetch
it
for
me
;
but
I
,
like
a
fool
,
must
be
officious
,
and
go
myself
along
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
about
two
mile
out
of
the
village
,
where
,
it
seem
,
they
keep
the
camel
and
horse
feed
under
a
guard
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
it
on
foot
,
with
my
old
pilot
in
company
,
and
a
Chinese
,
be
desirous
,
forsooth
,
of
a
little
variety
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
this
place
,
it
be
a
low
marshy
ground
,
wall
round
with
a
stone
wall
,
pile
up
dry
,
without
mortar
or
earth
among
it
,
like
a
park
,
with
a
little
guard
of
chinese
soldier
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
have
buy
a
camel
,
and
agree
for
the
price
,
I
come
away
;
and
the
chinese
man
,
that
go
with
me
,
lead
the
camel
,
when
on
a
sudden
come
up
five
tartar
on
horseback
:
<EOS>
two
of
them
seize
the
fellow
,
and
take
the
camel
from
him
,
while
the
other
three
step
up
to
me
and
my
old
pilot
;
see
us
,
as
it
be
,
unarmed
,
for
I
have
no
weapon
about
me
but
my
sword
,
which
could
but
ill
defend
me
against
three
horseman
.
<EOS>
the
first
that
come
up
stop
short
upon
my
draw
my
sword
;
(
for
they
be
arrant
coward
)
but
a
second
come
upon
my
left
,
give
me
a
blow
on
the
head
,
which
I
never
feel
till
afterwards
,
and
wonder
,
when
I
come
to
myself
,
what
be
the
matter
with
me
,
and
where
I
be
,
for
he
lay
me
flat
on
the
ground
;
but
my
never
-
fail
old
pilot
,
the
Portuguese
(
so
Providence
,
unlooke
for
,
direct
deliverance
from
danger
,
which
to
us
be
unforeseen
,
)
<EOS>
have
a
pistol
in
his
pocket
,
which
I
know
nothing
of
nor
the
Tartars
neither
;
if
they
have
,
I
suppose
they
would
not
have
attack
us
;
but
coward
be
always
bold
when
there
be
no
danger
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
see
me
down
,
with
a
bold
heart
step
up
to
the
fellow
that
have
strike
me
,
and
lay
hold
of
his
arm
with
one
hand
,
and
pull
him
down
by
main
force
a
little
towards
him
with
the
other
,
he
shoot
him
into
the
head
,
and
lay
him
dead
on
the
spot
;
he
then
immediately
step
up
to
him
who
have
stop
us
,
as
I
say
,
and
before
he
could
come
forward
again
(
for
it
be
all
do
as
it
be
in
a
moment
)
make
a
blow
at
him
with
a
scimitar
,
which
he
always
wear
,
but
,
miss
the
man
,
cut
his
horse
into
the
side
of
his
head
,
cut
one
of
his
ear
off
by
the
root
,
and
a
great
slice
down
the
side
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
poor
beast
,
enrage
with
the
wound
,
be
no
more
to
be
govern
by
his
rider
,
though
the
fellow
sit
well
enough
too
;
but
away
he
fly
,
and
carry
him
quite
out
of
the
pilot
's
reach
;
and
,
at
some
distance
,
rise
upon
his
hind
leg
,
throw
down
the
Tartar
,
and
fall
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
interval
the
poor
Chinese
come
in
,
who
have
lose
the
camel
,
but
he
have
no
weapon
;
however
,
see
the
Tartar
down
,
and
his
horse
fall
upon
him
,
he
run
to
him
,
and
seize
upon
an
ugly
ill
-
favour
weapon
he
have
by
his
side
,
something
like
a
pole
-
axe
,
but
not
a
pole
-
axe
either
,
he
wrench
it
from
him
,
and
make
shift
to
knock
his
tartarian
brain
out
with
it
.
<EOS>
but
my
old
man
have
the
third
Tartar
to
deal
with
still
;
and
,
see
he
do
not
fly
as
he
expect
,
nor
come
on
to
fight
him
,
as
he
apprehend
,
but
stand
stock
still
,
the
old
man
stand
still
too
,
and
fall
to
work
with
his
tackle
to
charge
his
pistol
again
:
but
as
soon
as
the
Tartar
see
the
pistol
,
whether
he
suppose
it
to
be
the
same
or
another
,
I
know
not
;
but
away
he
scour
,
and
leave
my
pilot
,
my
champion
I
call
him
afterwards
,
a
complete
victory
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
be
a
little
awake
;
for
I
think
,
when
I
first
begin
to
awake
,
that
I
have
be
in
a
sweet
sleep
;
but
as
I
say
above
,
I
wonder
where
I
be
,
how
I
come
upon
the
ground
,
and
what
be
the
matter
<EOS>
:
in
a
word
,
a
few
minute
after
,
as
sense
return
,
I
feel
pain
,
though
I
do
not
know
where
;
I
clap
my
hand
to
my
head
,
and
take
it
away
bloody
;
then
I
feel
my
head
ache
,
and
then
,
in
another
moment
,
memory
return
,
and
every
thing
be
present
to
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
jump
up
upon
my
foot
instantly
,
and
get
hold
of
my
sword
,
but
no
enemy
in
view
.
<EOS>
I
find
a
Tartar
lie
dead
,
and
his
horse
stand
very
quietly
by
him
;
and
look
farther
<EOS>
,
I
see
my
champion
and
deliverer
,
who
have
be
to
see
what
the
Chinese
have
do
,
come
back
with
his
hanger
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
see
me
on
my
foot
,
come
run
to
me
,
and
embrace
me
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
,
be
afraid
before
that
I
have
be
kill
;
and
see
me
bloody
,
would
see
how
I
be
hurt
;
but
it
be
not
much
,
only
what
we
call
a
broken
head
;
neither
do
I
afterwards
find
any
great
inconvenience
from
the
blow
,
other
than
the
place
which
be
hurt
,
and
which
be
well
again
in
two
or
three
day
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
no
great
gain
,
however
,
by
this
victory
;
for
we
lose
a
camel
,
and
gain
a
horse
:
but
that
which
be
remarkable
,
when
we
come
back
to
the
village
,
the
man
demand
to
be
pay
for
the
camel
;
I
dispute
it
,
and
it
be
bring
to
a
hearing
before
the
chinese
judge
of
the
place
;
that
be
to
say
,
in
English
,
we
go
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
.
<EOS>
give
him
his
due
,
he
act
with
a
great
deal
of
prudence
and
impartiality
;
and
have
hear
both
side
,
he
gravely
ask
the
chinese
man
that
go
with
me
to
buy
the
camel
,
whose
servant
he
be
?
"
I
be
no
servant
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
go
with
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
whose
request
?
"
say
the
justice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
the
stranger
's
request
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
say
the
justice
,
"
you
be
the
stranger
's
servant
for
the
time
;
and
the
camel
be
deliver
to
his
servant
,
it
be
deliver
to
him
,
and
he
must
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
confess
the
thing
be
so
clear
,
that
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
;
but
admire
to
see
such
just
reason
upon
the
consequence
,
and
so
accurate
state
the
case
,
I
pay
willingly
for
the
camel
,
and
send
for
another
;
but
you
may
observe
,
I
send
for
it
;
I
do
not
go
to
fetch
it
myself
any
more
;
I
have
have
enough
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
the
city
of
Naum
be
a
frontier
of
the
chinese
empire
:
they
call
it
fortify
,
and
so
it
be
,
as
fortification
go
there
;
for
this
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
that
all
the
Tartars
in
Karakathy
,
which
,
I
believe
,
be
some
million
,
could
not
batter
down
the
wall
with
their
bow
and
arrow
;
but
to
call
it
strong
,
if
it
be
attack
with
cannon
,
would
be
to
make
those
who
understand
it
laugh
at
you
.
  
<EOS>
We
want
,
as
I
have
say
,
about
two
day
journey
of
this
city
,
when
messenger
be
send
express
to
every
part
of
the
road
,
to
tell
all
traveller
and
caravan
to
halt
,
till
they
have
a
guard
send
to
them
;
for
that
an
unusual
body
of
tartar
,
make
ten
thousand
in
all
,
have
appear
in
the
way
,
about
thirty
mile
beyond
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
bad
news
to
traveller
;
however
,
it
be
carefully
do
of
the
governor
,
and
we
be
very
glad
to
hear
we
should
have
a
guard
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
two
day
after
,
we
have
two
hundred
soldier
send
us
from
a
garrison
of
the
Chinese
on
our
left
,
and
three
hundred
more
from
the
city
of
Naum
,
and
with
those
we
advance
boldly
:
the
three
hundred
soldier
from
Naum
march
in
our
front
,
the
two
hundred
in
our
rear
,
and
our
man
on
each
side
of
our
camel
with
our
baggage
,
and
the
whole
caravan
in
the
centre
.
<EOS>
in
this
order
,
and
well
prepared
for
battle
,
we
think
ourselves
a
match
for
the
whole
ten
thousand
Mogul
Tartars
,
if
they
have
appear
;
but
the
next
day
,
when
they
do
appear
,
it
be
quite
another
thing
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
early
in
the
morning
,
when
march
from
a
little
well
-
situate
town
,
call
Changu
,
we
have
a
river
to
pass
,
where
we
be
oblige
to
ferry
;
and
have
the
Tartars
have
any
intelligence
,
then
have
be
the
time
to
have
attack
us
,
when
,
the
caravan
be
over
,
the
rear
-
guard
be
behind
:
but
they
do
not
appear
there
.
  
<EOS>
about
three
hour
after
,
when
we
be
enter
upon
,
a
desert
of
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
mile
over
,
behold
,
by
a
cloud
of
dust
they
raise
,
we
see
an
enemy
be
at
hand
;
and
they
be
at
hand
indeed
,
for
they
come
on
upon
the
spur
.
  
<EOS>
the
Chinese
,
our
guard
on
the
front
,
who
have
talk
so
big
the
day
before
,
begin
to
stagger
,
and
the
soldier
frequently
look
behind
them
;
which
be
a
certain
sign
in
a
soldier
,
that
he
be
just
ready
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
My
old
pilot
be
of
my
mind
;
and
be
near
me
,
he
call
out
:
"
<EOS>
Seignior
Inglese
,
"
say
he
,
"
those
fellow
must
be
encourage
,
or
they
will
ruin
us
all
;
for
if
the
Tartars
come
on
,
they
will
never
stand
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
of
your
mind
,
"
say
I
:
"
but
what
course
must
be
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
?
"
say
he
;
"
let
fifty
of
our
man
advance
,
and
flank
them
on
each
wing
,
and
encourage
them
,
and
they
will
fight
like
brave
fellow
in
brave
company
:
<EOS>
but
without
it
,
they
will
every
man
turn
his
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
immediately
I
ride
up
to
our
leader
,
and
tell
him
,
who
be
exactly
of
our
mind
;
and
accordingly
fifty
of
us
march
to
the
right
wing
,
and
fifty
to
the
left
,
and
the
rest
make
a
line
of
reserve
;
for
so
we
march
,
leave
the
last
two
hundred
man
to
make
another
body
to
themselves
,
and
to
guard
the
camel
;
only
that
,
if
need
be
,
they
should
send
a
hundred
man
to
assist
the
last
fifty
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
Tartars
come
on
,
and
an
innumerable
company
they
be
;
how
many
,
we
could
not
tell
,
but
ten
thousand
we
think
be
the
least
.
<EOS>
a
party
of
them
come
on
first
,
and
view
our
posture
,
traverse
the
ground
in
the
front
of
our
line
;
and
as
we
find
them
within
gun
-
shot
,
our
leader
order
the
two
wing
to
advance
swiftly
,
and
give
them
a
salvo
on
each
wing
with
their
shot
,
which
be
do
;
but
they
go
off
,
and
I
suppose
go
back
to
give
an
account
of
the
reception
they
be
like
to
meet
with
;
and
,
indeed
,
that
salute
clog
their
stomach
;
for
they
immediately
halt
,
stand
awhile
to
consider
of
it
,
and
,
wheel
off
to
the
left
,
they
give
over
the
design
,
and
say
no
more
to
us
for
that
time
;
which
be
very
agreeable
to
our
circumstance
,
which
be
but
very
indifferent
for
a
battle
with
such
a
number
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
we
come
to
the
city
of
Naum
,
or
Naunm
.
<EOS>
We
thank
the
governor
for
his
care
for
us
,
and
collect
to
the
value
of
one
hundred
crown
,
or
thereabout
,
which
we
give
to
the
soldier
send
to
guard
us
;
and
here
we
rest
one
day
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
garrison
indeed
,
and
there
be
nine
hundred
soldier
keep
here
;
but
the
reason
of
it
be
,
that
formerly
the
Muscovite
frontier
lie
near
to
them
than
they
do
now
,
the
Muscovites
have
abandon
that
part
of
the
country
(
which
lie
from
the
city
west
,
for
about
two
hundred
mile
)
as
desolate
and
unfit
for
use
;
and
more
especially
,
be
so
very
remote
,
and
so
difficult
to
send
troop
hither
for
its
defence
;
for
we
have
yet
above
two
thousand
mile
to
Muscovy
,
properly
so
call
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
we
pass
several
great
river
,
and
two
dreadful
desert
,
one
of
which
we
be
sixteen
day
pass
over
,
and
which
,
as
I
say
,
be
to
be
call
no
Man
's
land
;
and
on
the
13th
of
April
we
come
to
the
frontier
of
the
Muscovite
dominion
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
first
city
,
or
town
,
or
fortress
,
whatever
it
may
be
call
,
that
belong
to
the
czar
of
Muscovy
,
be
call
Argun
,
be
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
Argun
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
discover
an
infinite
satisfaction
;
that
I
be
now
arrive
in
,
as
I
call
it
,
a
christian
country
;
or
,
at
least
,
in
a
country
govern
by
Christians
:
for
though
the
Muscovites
do
,
in
my
opinion
,
but
just
deserve
the
name
of
Christians
(
yet
such
they
pretend
to
be
,
and
be
very
devout
in
their
way
:
)
<EOS>
it
would
certainly
occur
to
any
man
who
travel
the
world
as
I
have
do
,
and
who
have
any
power
of
reflection
;
I
say
,
it
would
occur
to
him
,
to
reflect
,
what
a
blessing
it
be
to
be
bring
into
the
world
where
the
name
of
God
,
and
of
a
Redeemer
,
be
know
,
worship
,
and
adore
 
and
not
where
the
people
,
give
up
by
Heaven
to
strong
delusion
,
worship
the
devil
,
and
prostrate
themselves
to
stock
and
stone
;
worship
monster
,
element
,
horrible
-
shape
animal
,
and
statue
,
or
image
of
monster
.
<EOS>
not
a
town
or
city
we
pass
through
but
have
their
pagod
,
their
idol
,
and
their
temple
;
and
ignorant
people
worship
even
the
work
of
their
own
hand
!
  
<EOS>
now
we
come
where
,
at
least
,
a
face
of
the
christian
worship
appear
,
where
the
knee
be
bow
to
Jesus
;
and
whether
ignorantly
or
not
,
yet
the
christian
religion
be
own
,
and
the
name
of
the
true
God
be
call
upon
and
adore
;
and
it
make
the
very
recess
of
my
soul
rejoice
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
salute
the
brave
Scotch
merchant
I
mention
above
,
with
my
first
acknowledgment
of
this
;
and
,
take
him
by
the
hand
,
I
say
to
him
,
"
bless
be
God
,
we
be
once
again
come
among
Christians
!
"
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
answer
,
"
do
not
rejoice
too
soon
,
countryman
;
these
muscovite
be
but
an
odd
sort
of
Christians
;
and
<EOS>
but
for
the
name
of
it
,
you
may
see
very
little
of
the
substance
for
some
month
farther
of
our
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
still
it
be
well
than
paganism
,
and
worship
of
devil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
will
tell
you
,
"
say
he
;
"
except
the
russian
soldier
in
garrison
,
and
a
few
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
city
upon
the
road
,
all
the
rest
of
this
country
,
for
above
a
thousand
mile
farther
,
be
inhabit
by
the
bad
and
most
ignorant
of
pagan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
indeed
we
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
launch
into
the
great
piece
of
solid
earth
,
if
I
understand
any
thing
of
the
surface
of
the
globe
,
that
be
to
be
find
in
any
part
of
the
world
:
we
have
at
least
twelve
hundred
mile
to
the
sea
,
eastward
;
we
have
at
least
two
thousand
to
the
bottom
of
the
Baltic
sea
,
westward
;
and
almost
three
thousand
mile
,
if
we
leave
that
sea
,
and
go
on
west
to
the
british
and
french
channel
;
we
have
full
five
thousand
mile
to
the
indian
or
persian
sea
,
south
;
and
about
eight
hundred
mile
to
the
Frozen
sea
,
north
;
<EOS>
nay
,
if
some
people
may
be
believe
,
there
may
be
no
sea
north
-
east
till
we
come
round
the
pole
,
and
consequently
into
the
north
-
west
,
and
so
have
a
continent
of
land
into
America
<EOS>
,
no
mortal
know
where
;
though
I
could
give
some
reason
why
I
believe
that
to
be
a
mistake
too
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
enter
into
the
Muscovite
dominion
,
a
good
while
before
we
come
to
any
considerable
town
,
we
have
nothing
to
observe
there
<EOS>
but
this
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
all
the
river
run
to
the
east
.
<EOS>
as
I
understand
by
the
chart
which
some
of
our
caravan
have
with
them
,
it
be
plain
that
all
those
river
run
into
the
great
river
Yamour
,
or
Gammour
.
<EOS>
this
river
,
by
the
natural
course
of
it
,
must
run
into
the
east
sea
,
or
chinese
ocean
.
<EOS>
the
story
they
tell
us
,
that
the
mouth
of
this
river
be
choke
up
with
bulrush
of
a
monstrous
growth
,
viz
.
<EOS>
three
foot
about
,
and
twenty
or
thirty
foot
high
,
I
must
be
allow
to
say
I
believe
nothing
of
;
but
as
its
navigation
be
of
no
use
,
because
there
be
no
trade
that
way
,
the
Tartars
,
to
whom
alone
it
belong
,
deal
in
nothing
but
cattle
;
so
nobody
that
ever
I
hear
or
,
have
be
curious
enough
either
to
go
down
to
the
mouth
of
it
in
boat
,
or
to
come
up
from
the
mouth
of
it
in
ship
;
but
this
be
certain
,
that
this
river
run
due
east
,
in
the
latitude
of
sixty
degree
,
carry
a
vast
concourse
of
river
along
with
it
,
and
find
an
ocean
to
empty
itself
in
that
latitude
;
so
we
be
sure
of
sea
there
.
  
<EOS>
some
league
to
the
north
of
this
river
there
be
several
considerable
river
,
whose
stream
run
as
due
north
as
the
Yamour
run
east
;
and
these
be
all
find
to
join
their
water
with
the
great
river
Tartarus
,
name
so
from
the
northernmost
nation
of
the
Mogul
Tartars
,
who
,
the
Chinese
say
,
be
the
first
Tartars
in
the
world
;
and
who
,
as
our
geographer
allege
,
be
the
Gog
and
Magog
mention
in
sacred
story
.
  
<EOS>
these
river
run
all
northward
,
as
well
as
all
the
other
river
I
be
yet
to
speak
of
,
make
it
evident
that
the
northern
ocean
bound
the
land
also
on
that
side
;
so
that
it
do
not
seem
rational
in
the
least
to
think
that
the
land
can
extend
itself
to
join
with
America
on
that
side
,
or
that
there
be
not
a
communication
between
the
northern
and
the
eastern
ocean
;
but
of
this
I
shall
say
no
more
;
it
be
my
observation
at
that
time
,
and
therefore
I
take
notice
of
it
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
We
now
advance
from
the
river
Arguna
by
easy
and
moderate
journie
,
and
be
very
visibly
oblige
to
the
care
the
czar
of
Muscovy
have
take
to
have
city
and
town
build
in
as
many
place
as
be
possible
to
place
them
,
where
his
soldier
keep
garrison
,
something
,
like
the
stationary
soldier
place
by
the
Romans
in
the
remote
country
of
their
empire
,
some
of
which
I
have
read
be
particularly
place
in
Britain
for
the
security
of
commerce
,
and
for
the
lodging
of
traveller
;
and
thus
it
be
here
;
though
wherever
we
come
at
these
town
and
station
the
garrison
and
governor
be
Russians
and
profess
mere
pagan
,
sacrifice
to
idol
,
and
worship
the
sun
,
moon
,
and
star
,
or
all
the
host
of
heaven
;
and
not
only
so
,
but
be
,
of
all
the
heathen
and
pagan
that
ever
I
meet
with
,
the
most
barbarous
,
except
only
that
they
do
not
eat
man
's
flesh
,
as
our
savage
of
America
do
.
  
<EOS>
some
instance
of
this
we
meet
with
in
the
country
between
Arguna
,
where
we
enter
the
Muscovite
dominion
,
and
a
city
of
Tartars
and
Russians
together
,
call
Nertzinskay
;
in
which
space
be
a
continued
desert
or
forest
,
which
cost
us
twenty
day
to
travel
over
it
.
<EOS>
in
a
village
near
the
last
of
those
place
,
I
have
the
curiosity
to
go
and
see
their
way
of
living
;
which
be
most
brutish
and
unsufferable
:
they
have
,
I
suppose
,
a
great
sacrifice
that
day
;
for
there
stand
out
upon
an
old
stump
of
a
tree
,
an
idol
make
of
wood
,
frightful
as
the
devil
;
at
least
as
any
thing
we
can
think
of
to
represent
the
devil
that
can
be
make
.
<EOS>
It
have
a
head
certainly
not
so
much
as
resemble
any
creature
that
the
world
ever
see
;
ear
as
big
as
goat
'
horn
,
and
as
high
;
<EOS>
eye
as
big
as
a
crown
-
piece
;
and
a
nose
like
a
crooked
ram
's
horn
,
and
a
mouth
extend
four
-
cornered
,
like
that
of
a
lion
,
with
horrible
tooth
,
hook
like
a
parrot
's
under
bill
.
<EOS>
It
be
dress
up
in
the
filthiest
manner
that
you
can
suppose
;
its
upper
garment
be
of
sheep
-
skin
,
with
the
wool
outward
;
a
great
Tartar
bonnet
on
the
head
,
with
two
horn
grow
through
it
<EOS>
:
it
be
about
eight
foot
high
,
yet
have
no
foot
or
leg
,
or
any
other
proportion
of
part
.
  
<EOS>
this
scarecrow
be
set
up
at
the
outside
of
the
village
;
and
when
I
come
near
to
it
,
there
be
sixteen
or
seventeen
creature
,
whether
man
or
woman
I
could
not
tell
,
for
they
make
no
distinction
by
their
habit
,
either
of
body
or
head
;
these
lie
all
flat
on
the
ground
,
round
this
formidable
block
of
shapeless
wood
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
motion
among
them
any
more
than
if
they
have
be
log
of
wood
,
like
their
idol
;
at
first
I
really
think
they
have
be
so
;
but
when
I
come
a
little
nearer
,
they
start
up
upon
their
foot
,
and
raise
a
howl
cry
,
as
if
it
have
be
so
many
deep
-
mouthed
hound
,
and
walk
away
as
if
they
be
displeased
at
our
disturb
them
.
<EOS>
a
little
way
off
from
this
monster
,
and
at
the
door
of
a
tent
or
hut
,
make
all
of
sheep
-
skin
and
cow
-
skin
,
dry
,
stand
three
butcher
<EOS>
:
I
think
they
be
such
;
for
when
I
come
nearer
to
them
,
I
find
they
have
long
knife
in
their
hand
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
appear
three
sheep
kill
,
and
one
young
bullock
,
or
steer
.
<EOS>
these
,
it
seem
,
be
sacrifice
to
that
senseless
log
of
an
idol
;
and
these
three
man
priest
belong
to
it
;
and
the
seventeen
prostrate
wretch
be
the
people
who
bring
the
offering
,
and
be
make
their
prayer
to
that
stock
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
be
more
moved
at
their
stupidity
,
and
this
brutish
worship
of
a
hobgoblin
,
<EOS>
than
ever
I
be
at
any
thing
in
my
life
:
to
see
God
's
most
glorious
and
good
creature
,
to
whom
be
have
grant
so
many
advantage
,
even
by
creation
,
above
the
rest
of
the
work
of
his
hand
,
vest
with
a
reasonable
soul
,
and
that
soul
adorn
with
faculty
and
capacity
adapt
both
to
honour
his
maker
and
be
honour
by
him
;
I
say
,
to
see
it
sink
and
degenerate
to
a
degree
so
more
than
stupid
,
as
to
prostrate
itself
to
a
frightful
nothing
,
a
mere
imaginary
object
dress
up
by
themselves
,
and
make
terrible
to
themselves
by
their
own
contrivance
,
adorn
only
with
clout
and
rag
;
and
that
this
should
be
the
effect
of
mere
ignorance
,
work
up
into
hellish
devotion
by
the
devil
himself
;
who
,
envy
his
maker
the
homage
and
adoration
of
his
creature
,
have
delude
them
into
such
gross
,
surfeiting
,
sordid
,
and
brutish
thing
,
as
one
would
think
should
shock
nature
itself
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
signify
all
the
astonishment
and
reflection
of
thought
?
<EOS>
thus
it
be
,
and
I
see
it
before
my
eye
;
and
there
be
no
room
to
wonder
at
it
,
or
think
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
all
my
admiration
turn
to
rage
;
and
I
ride
up
to
the
image
or
monster
,
call
it
what
you
will
,
and
with
my
sword
cut
the
bonnet
that
be
on
its
head
in
two
in
the
middle
,
so
that
it
hang
down
by
one
of
the
horn
;
and
one
of
our
man
that
be
with
me
,
take
hold
of
the
sheep
skin
that
cover
it
,
and
pull
at
it
,
when
,
behold
,
a
most
hideous
outcry
and
howling
run
through
the
village
,
and
two
or
three
hundred
people
come
about
my
ear
,
so
that
I
be
glad
to
scour
for
it
;
for
we
see
some
have
bow
and
arrow
;
but
I
resolve
from
that
moment
to
visit
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
Our
caravan
rest
three
night
at
the
town
,
which
be
about
four
mile
off
,
in
order
to
provide
some
horse
,
which
they
want
,
several
of
the
horse
have
be
lame
and
jade
with
the
badness
of
the
way
,
and
our
long
march
over
the
last
desert
;
so
we
have
some
leisure
here
to
put
my
design
in
execution
.
<EOS>
I
communicate
my
project
to
the
Scots
merchant
,
of
Moscow
,
of
whose
courage
I
have
have
a
sufficient
testimony
,
as
above
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
what
I
have
see
,
and
with
what
indignation
I
have
since
think
that
human
nature
could
be
so
degenerate
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
be
resolve
,
if
I
could
get
but
four
or
five
man
well
armed
to
go
with
me
,
to
go
and
destroy
that
vile
,
abominable
idol
;
to
let
them
see
,
that
it
have
no
power
to
help
itself
,
and
consequently
could
not
be
an
object
of
worship
,
or
to
be
pray
to
,
<EOS>
much
less
help
them
that
offer
sacrifice
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
at
me
:
say
he
,
"
Your
zeal
may
be
good
;
but
what
do
you
propose
to
yourself
by
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Propose
!
"
say
I
:
"
to
vindicate
the
honour
of
God
,
which
be
insult
by
this
devil
-
worship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
will
it
vindicate
the
honour
of
God
,
"
say
he
,
"
while
the
people
will
not
be
able
to
know
what
you
mean
by
it
,
unless
you
could
speak
to
them
too
,
and
tell
them
so
?
<EOS>
and
then
they
will
fight
you
too
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
,
for
they
be
desperate
fellow
,
and
that
especially
in
defence
of
their
idolatry
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
we
not
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
it
in
the
night
,
and
then
leave
them
the
reason
in
writing
,
in
their
own
language
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
writing
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
;
"
why
,
there
be
not
in
five
nation
of
them
one
man
that
know
any

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
wretched
ignorance
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
to
him
:
"
however
,
I
have
a
great
mind
to
do
it
;
perhaps
nature
may
draw
inference
from
it
to
them
,
to
let
them
see
how
brutish
they
be
to
worship
such
horrid
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
look
you
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
;
"
if
your
zeal
prompt
you
to
it
so
warmly
,
you
must
do
it
;
but
in
the
next
place
,
I
would
have
you
consider
these
wild
nation
of
people
be
subject
by
force
to
the
czar
of
Muscovy
's
dominion
;
and
if
you
do
this
,
it
be
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
they
will
come
by
thousand
to
the
governor
of
Nertzinskay
,
and
complain
,
and
demand
satisfaction
;
and
if
he
can
not
give
them
satisfaction
,
it
be
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
they
revolt
;
and
it
will
occasion
a
new
war
with
all
the
Tartars
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
confess
,
put
new
thought
into
my
head
for
a
while
;
but
I
harp
upon
the
same
string
still
;
and
all
that
day
I
be
uneasy
to
put
my
project
in
execution
.
<EOS>
towards
the
evening
the
Scots
merchant
meet
me
by
accident
in
our
walk
about
the
town
,
and
desire
to
speak
with
me
:
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
put
you
off
your
good
design
;
I
have
be
a
little
concerned
about
it
since
;
for
I
abhor
the
idol
and
idolatry
as
much
as
you
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
truly
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
have
put
it
off
a
little
,
as
to
the
execution
of
it
,
but
you
have
not
put
it
all
out
of
my
thought
;
and
,
I
believe
,
I
shall
do
it
still
before
I
quit
this
place
,
though
I
be
to
be
deliver
up
to
them
for
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
God
forbid
they
should
deliver
you
up
to
such
a
crew
of
monster
!
<EOS>
they
shall
not
do
that
neither
;
that
would
be
murder
you
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
how
would
they
use
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
use
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
:
"
I
will
tell
you
how
they
serve
a
poor
Russian
,
who
affront
them
in
their
worship
just
as
you
do
,
and
whom
they
take
prisoner
,
after
they
have
lame
him
with
an
arrow
,
that
he
could
not
run
away
:
they
take
him
and
strip
him
stark
naked
,
and
set
him
upon
the
top
of
the
idol
monster
,
and
stand
all
round
him
,
and
shoot
as
many
arrow
into
him
as
would
stick
over
his
whole
body
;
and
then
they
burn
him
,
and
all
the
arrow
stick
in
him
,
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
idol
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
be
this
the
same
idol
:
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
very
same
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
will
tell
you
a
story
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
relate
the
story
of
our
man
at
Madagascar
,
and
how
they
burn
and
sack
the
village
there
,
and
kill
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
for
their
murder
one
of
our
man
,
just
as
it
be
relate
before
;
and
when
I
have
do
,
I
add
,
that
I
think
we
ought
to
do
so
to
this
village
.
  
<EOS>
He
listen
very
attentively
to
the
story
;
but
when
I
talk
of
do
so
to
that
village
,
say
he
,
"
You
mistake
very
much
;
it
be
not
this
village
,
it
be
almost
a
hundred
mile
from
this
place
;
but
it
be
the
same
idol
,
for
they
carry
him
about
in
procession
all
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
then
that
idol
ought
to
be
punish
for
it
;
and
it
shall
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
I
live
this
night
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
find
me
resolute
,
he
like
the
design
,
and
tell
me
,
I
should
not
go
alone
,
but
he
would
go
with
me
;
but
he
would
go
first
,
and
bring
a
stout
fellow
,
one
of
his
countryman
,
to
go
also
with
us
;
"
and
one
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
famous
for
his
zeal
as
you
can
desire
any
one
to
be
against
such
devilish
thing
as
these
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
bring
me
his
comrade
a
Scotsman
,
whom
he
call
Captain
Richardson
;
and
I
give
him
a
full
account
of
what
I
have
see
,
and
also
what
I
intend
;
and
he
tell
me
readily
,
he
would
go
with
me
,
if
it
cost
him
his
life
.
<EOS>
so
we
agree
to
go
,
only
we
three
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
propose
it
to
my
partner
,
but
he
decline
it
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
be
ready
to
assist
me
to
the
utmost
,
and
upon
all
occasion
,
for
my
defence
;
but
that
this
be
an
adventure
quite
out
of
his
way
:
<EOS>
so
,
I
say
,
we
resolve
upon
our
work
,
only
we
three
,
and
my
man
-
servant
,
and
to
put
it
in
execution
that
night
about
midnight
,
with
all
the
secresy
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
upon
second
thought
,
we
be
willing
to
delay
it
till
the
next
night
,
because
the
caravan
be
to
set
forward
in
the
morning
,
we
suppose
the
governor
could
not
pretend
to
give
them
any
satisfaction
upon
us
when
we
be
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
the
Scots
merchant
,
as
steady
in
his
resolution
to
enterprise
it
as
bold
in
execute
,
bring
me
a
Tartar
's
robe
or
gown
of
sheep
-
skin
,
and
a
bonnet
,
with
a
bow
and
arrow
,
and
have
provide
the
same
for
himself
and
his
countryman
,
that
the
people
,
if
they
see
us
,
should
not
be
able
to
determine
who
we
be
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
first
night
we
spend
in
mix
up
some
combustible
matter
with
aqua
-
vitae
,
gunpowder
,
and
such
other
material
as
we
could
get
;
and
,
have
a
good
quantity
of
tar
in
a
little
pot
,
about
an
hour
after
night
we
set
out
upon
our
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
to
the
place
about
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
and
find
that
the
people
have
not
the
least
jealousy
of
danger
attend
their
idol
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
cloudy
;
yet
the
moon
give
us
light
enough
to
see
that
the
idol
stand
just
in
the
same
posture
and
place
that
it
do
before
.
<EOS>
the
people
seem
to
be
all
at
their
rest
;
only
,
that
in
the
great
hut
,
or
tent
as
we
call
it
,
where
we
see
the
three
priest
,
whom
we
mistake
for
butcher
,
we
see
a
light
,
and
go
up
close
to
the
door
,
we
hear
people
talk
,
as
if
there
be
five
or
six
of
them
;
we
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
if
we
set
wildfire
to
the
idol
,
these
man
would
come
out
immediately
,
and
run
up
to
the
place
to
rescue
it
from
the
destruction
that
we
intend
for
it
;
and
what
to
do
with
them
we
know
not
.
<EOS>
once
we
think
of
carry
it
away
,
and
set
fire
to
it
at
a
distance
,
but
when
we
come
to
handle
it
we
find
it
too
bulky
for
our
carriage
;
so
we
be
at
a
loss
again
.
<EOS>
the
second
Scotsman
be
for
set
fire
to
the
tent
or
hut
,
and
knock
the
creature
that
be
there
on
the
head
,
when
they
come
out
;
but
I
could
not
join
with
that
;
I
be
against
kill
them
,
if
it
be
possible
to
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
then
,
"
say
the
Scots
merchant
,
"
I
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
;
we
will
try
to
make
them
prisoner
,
tie
their
hand
,
and
make
them
stand
and
see
their
idol
destroy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
it
happen
,
we
have
twine
or
packthread
enough
about
us
,
which
we
use
to
tie
our
fire
-
work
together
with
;
so
we
resolve
to
attack
these
people
first
,
and
with
as
little
noise
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
we
do
,
we
knock
at
the
door
,
when
one
of
the
priest
come
to
it
,
we
immediately
seize
upon
him
,
stop
his
mouth
,
and
tie
his
hand
behind
him
,
and
lead
him
to
the
idol
,
where
we
gag
him
that
he
may
not
make
a
noise
,
tie
his
foot
also
together
,
and
leave
him
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
two
of
us
then
wait
at
the
door
,
expect
that
another
would
come
out
to
see
what
the
matter
be
;
but
we
wait
so
long
till
the
third
man
come
back
to
us
;
and
then
nobody
come
out
,
we
knock
again
gently
,
and
immediately
out
come
two
more
,
and
we
serve
them
just
in
the
same
manner
,
but
be
oblige
to
go
all
with
them
,
and
lie
them
down
by
the
idol
some
distance
from
one
another
;
when
go
back
we
find
two
more
be
come
out
to
the
door
,
and
a
third
stand
behind
them
within
the
door
.
<EOS>
We
seize
the
two
,
and
immediately
tie
them
,
when
the
third
step
back
,
and
cry
out
,
my
Scots
merchant
go
in
after
him
,
and
take
out
a
composition
we
have
make
,
that
would
only
smoke
and
stink
,
he
set
fire
to
it
,
and
throw
it
in
among
them
:
by
that
time
the
other
Scotsman
and
my
man
take
charge
of
the
two
man
already
bind
,
and
tie
together
also
by
the
arm
,
lead
them
away
to
the
idol
,
and
leave
them
there
,
to
see
if
their
idol
would
relieve
them
,
make
haste
back
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
furze
we
have
throw
in
have
fill
the
hut
with
so
much
smoke
that
they
be
almost
suffocate
,
we
then
throw
in
a
small
leather
bag
of
another
kind
,
which
flame
like
a
candle
,
and
follow
it
in
,
we
find
there
be
but
four
people
leave
,
who
,
it
seem
,
be
two
man
and
two
woman
,
and
,
as
we
suppose
,
have
be
about
some
of
their
diabolic
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
They
appear
,
in
short
,
fright
to
death
,
at
least
so
as
to
sit
tremble
and
stupid
,
and
not
able
to
speak
neither
,
for
the
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
take
them
,
bind
them
as
we
have
the
other
,
and
all
without
any
noise
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
say
,
we
bring
them
out
of
the
house
,
or
hut
,
first
;
for
,
indeed
,
we
be
not
able
to
bear
the
smoke
any
;
more
than
they
be
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
do
this
,
we
carry
them
all
together
to
the
idol
:
when
we
come
there
we
fall
to
work
with
him
;
and
first
we
daub
him
all
over
,
and
his
robe
also
,
with
tar
,
and
such
other
stuff
as
we
have
,
which
be
tallow
mix
with
brimstone
;
then
we
stop
his
eye
,
and
ear
,
and
,
mouth
full
of
gunpowder
;
then
we
wrap
up
a
great
piece
of
wildfire
in
his
bonnet
;
and
then
stick
all
the
combustible
we
have
bring
with
us
upon
;
him
,
we
look
about
to
see
if
we
could
find
any
thing
else
to
help
to
burn
him
;
when
my
Scotsman
remember
that
by
the
tent
,
or
hut
,
where
the
man
be
,
there
lie
a
heap
of
dry
forage
,
whether
straw
or
rush
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
:
away
he
and
the
other
Scotsman
run
,
and
fetch
their
arm
full
of
that
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
do
this
,
we
take
all
our
prisoner
,
and
bring
them
,
have
untie
their
foot
and
ungagged
their
mouth
,
and
make
them
stand
up
,
and
set
them
all
before
their
monstrous
idol
,
and
then
set
fire
to
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay
by
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
or
thereabout
,
til
the
powder
in
the
eye
,
and
mouth
,
and
ear
of
the
idol
blow
up
,
and
,
as
we
could
perceive
,
have
split
and
deform
the
shape
of
it
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
till
we
see
it
burn
into
a
mere
block
or
log
of
wood
;
and
then
ignite
the
dry
forage
to
it
,
we
find
it
would
be
soon
quite
consume
;
so
we
begin
to
think
of
go
away
;
but
the
Scotsman
say
,
"
no
,
we
must
not
go
,
for
these
poor
delude
wretch
will
all
throw
themselves
into
the
fire
,
and
burn
themselves
with
the
idol
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
we
resolve
to
stay
till
the
forage
be
burn
down
too
,
and
then
we
come
away
and
leave
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
we
appear
among
our
fellow
-
traveller
,
exceed
busy
in
get
ready
for
our
journey
;
nor
could
any
man
suggest
that
we
have
be
any
where
but
in
our
bed
,
as
traveller
may
be
suppose
to
be
,
to
fit
themselves
for
the
fatigue
of
that
day
's
journey
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
end
so
;
for
the
next
day
come
a
great
multitude
of
the
country
people
,
not
only
of
this
village
,
but
of
a
hundred
more
,
for
aught
I
know
,
to
the
town
-
gate
;
and
in
a
most
outrageous
manner
demand
satisfaction
of
the
russian
governor
,
for
the
insult
their
priest
,
and
burn
their
great
Cham
-
Chi
-
Thaungu
;
such
a
hard
name
they
give
the
monstrous
creature
they
worship
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
Nertzinskay
be
at
first
in
a
great
consternation
;
for
they
say
the
Tartars
be
no
less
than
thirty
thousand
,
and
that
in
a
few
day
more
they
would
be
one
hundred
thousand
strong
.
  
<EOS>
the
russian
governor
send
out
messenger
to
appease
them
,
and
give
them
all
the
good
word
imaginable
.
<EOS>
He
assure
them
he
know
nothing
of
it
,
and
that
there
have
not
a
soul
of
his
garrison
be
abroad
;
that
it
could
not
be
from
any
body
there
;
and
if
they
would
let
him
know
who
it
be
,
he
should
be
exemplarily
punish
.
<EOS>
They
return
haughtily
,
that
all
the
country
reverence
the
great
Cham
-
Chi

,
who
dwelt
in
the
son
,
and
no
mortal
would
have
dare
to
offer
violence
to
his
image
,
but
some
christian
miscreant
;
so
they
call
them
,
it
seem
;
and
they
therefore
denounce
war
against
him
,
and
all
the
Russians
,
who
,
they
say
,
be
miscreant
and
Christians
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
,
still
patient
,
and
unwilling
to
make
a
breach
,
or
to
have
any
cause
of
war
allege
to
be
give
by
him
,
the
czar
have
straitly
charge
him
to
treat
the
conquered
country
with
gentleness
and
civility
,
give
them
still
all
the
good
word
he
could
;
at
last
he
tell
them
,
there
be
a
caravan
go
towards
Russia
that
morning
,
and
perhaps
it
be
some
of
them
who
have
do
them
this
injury
;
and
that
,
if
they
would
be
satisfied
with
that
,
he
would
send
after
them
,
to
inquire
into
it
.
<EOS>
this
seem
to
appease
them
a
little
;
and
accordingly
the
governor
send
after
us
,
and
give
us
a
particular
account
how
the
thing
be
,
intimate
withal
,
that
if
any
in
our
caravan
have
do
it
,
they
should
make
their
escape
;
but
that
whether
they
have
do
it
or
no
,
we
should
make
all
the
haste
forward
that
be
possible
;
and
that
in
the
meantime
he
would
keep
them
in
play
as
long
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
friendly
in
the
governor
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
it
come
to
the
caravan
,
there
be
<EOS>
nobody
know
any
thing
of
the
matter
;
and
,
as
for
us
that
be
guilty
,
we
be
the
least
of
all
suspect
;
none
so
much
as
ask
us
the
question
;
however
,
the
captain
of
the
caravan
,
for
the
time
,
take
the
hint
that
the
governor
give
us
,
and
we
march
or
travel
two
day
and
two
night
without
any
considerable
stop
,
and
then
we
lie
at
a
village
call
Plothus
;
nor
do
we
make
any
long
stop
here
,
but
hasten
on
towards
Jarawena
,
another
of
the
czar
of
Muscovy
's
colony
,
and
where
we
expect
we
should
be
safe
;
but
it
be
to
be
observe
,
that
here
we
begin
,
for
two
or
three
day
march
,
to
enter
upon
a
vast
nameless
desert
,
of
which
I
shall
say
more
in
its
place
;
and
which
if
we
have
now
be
upon
it
,
it
be
more
than
probable
we
have
be
all
destroy
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
second
day
's
march
from
Plothus
that
by
the
cloud
of
dust
behind
us
at
a
great
distance
,
some
of
our
people
begin
to
be
sensible
we
be
pursue
;
we
have
enter
the
desert
,
and
have
pass
by
a
great
lake
,
call
Schanks
Osier
,
when
we
perceive
a
very
great
body
of
horse
appear
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
to
the
north
,
we
travel
west
.
<EOS>
We
observe
they
go
away
west
,
as
we
do
;
but
have
suppose
we
should
have
take
that
side
of
the
lake
,
whereas
we
very
happily
take
the
south
side
:
and
in
two
day
more
we
see
them
not
<EOS>
,
for
they
,
believe
we
be
still
before
them
,
push
on
,
till
they
come
to
the
river
Udda
:
this
be
a
very
great
river
when
it
pass
farther
north
,
but
when
we
come
to
it
,
we
find
it
narrow
and
fordable
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
day
they
either
find
their
mistake
,
or
have
intelligence
of
us
,
and
come
pour
in
upon
us
towards
the
dusk
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
We
have
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
,
just
pitch
upon
a
place
for
our
camp
,
which
be
very
convenient
for
the
night
;
for
as
we
be
upon
a
desert
,
though
but
at
the
beginning
of
it
,
that
be
above
five
hundred
mile
over
,
we
have
no
town
to
lodge
at
,
and
,
indeed
,
expect
none
but
the
city
of
Jarawena
,
which
we
have
yet
two
day
march
to
;
the
desert
,
however
,
have
some
few
wood
in
it
on
this
side
,
and
little
river
,
which
run
all
into
the
great
river
Udda
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
a
narrow
strait
,
between
two
small
but
very
thick
wood
,
that
we
pitch
our
little
camp
for
that
night
,
expect
to
be
attack
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
nobody
know
<EOS>
but
ourselves
what
we
be
pursue
for
;
but
<EOS>
as
it
be
usual
for
the
Mogul
Tartars
to
go
about
in
troop
in
that
desert
,
so
the
caravan
always
fortify
themselves
every
night
against
them
,
as
against
army
of
robber
;
and
it
be
therefore
no
new
thing
to
be
pursue
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
have
this
night
,
of
all
the
night
of
our
travel
,
a
most
advantageous
camp
;
for
we
lie
between
two
wood
,
with
a
little
rivulet
run
just
before
our
front
;
so
that
we
could
not
be
surround
or
attack
any
way
,
but
in
our
front
or
rear
:
we
take
care
also
to
make
our
front
as
strong
as
we
could
,
by
place
our
pack
,
with
our
camel
and
horse
,
all
in
a
line
on
the
side
of
the
river
,
and
we
fell
some
tree
in
our
rear
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
posture
we
encamp
for
the
night
;
but
the
enemy
be
upon
us
before
we
have
finish
our
situation
:
they
do
not
come
on
us
like
thief
,
as
we
expect
,
but
send
three
messenger
to
us
,
to
demand
the
man
to
be
deliver
to
them
,
that
have
abuse
their
priest
,
and
burn
their
god
Cham
-
Chi
-
Thaungu
,
that
they
may
burn
them
with
fire
;
and
,
upon
this
,
they
say
,
they
would
go
away
,
and
do
us
no
farther
harm
,
otherwise
they
would
burn
us
all
with
fire
.
<EOS>
Our
man
look
very
blank
at
this
message
,
and
begin
to
stare
at
one
another
,
to
see
who
look
with
most
guilt
in
their
face
,
but
,
nobody
be
the
word
,
nobody
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
leader
of
the
caravan
send
word
,
he
be
well
assure
it
be
not
do
,
by
any
of
our
camp
;
that
we
be
peaceable
merchant
,
travel
on
our
business
;
that
we
have
do
no
harm
to
them
,
or
to
any
one
else
;
and
therefore
they
must
look
farther
for
their
enemy
,
who
have
injure
them
,
for
we
be
not
the
people
;
so
desire
them
not
to
disturb
us
;
for
,
if
they
do
,
we
should
defend
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
far
from
be
satisfied
with
this
for
an
answer
,
and
a
great
crowd
of
them
come
down
in
the
morning
,
by
break
of
day
,
to
our
camp
;
but
,
see
us
in
such
an
advantageous
situation
,
they
durst
come
no
farther
than
the
brook
in
our
front
,
where
they
stand
,
and
shew
us
such
a
number
,
as
,
indeed
,
terrify
us
very
much
;
for
those
that
speak
least
of
them
,
speak
of
ten
thousand
.
<EOS>
here
they
stand
,
and
look
at
us
awhile
,
and
then
set
up
a
great
howl
,
they
let
fly
a
cloud
of
arrow
among
us
;
but
we
be
well
enough
fortify
for
that
,
for
we
be
shelter
under
our
baggage
;
and
I
do
not
remember
that
one
man
of
us
be
hurt
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
we
see
them
move
a
little
to
our
right
,
and
expect
them
on
the
rear
,
when
a
cunning
fellow
,
a
Cossack
,
as
they
call
them
,
of
Jarawena
,
in
the
pay
of
the
Muscovites
,
call
to
the
leader
of
the
caravan
,
say
to
him
,
"
I
will
send
all
these
people
away
to
Sibeilka
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
city
four
or
five
day
journey
at
least
to
the
south
,
and
rather
behind
us
.
<EOS>
so
he
take
his
bow
and
arrow
,
and
,
get
on
horseback
,
he
ride
away
from
our
rear
directly
,
as
it
be
,
back
to
Nertzinskay
;
after
this
,
he
take
a
great
circuit
about
,
and
come
to
the
army
of
the
Tartars
,
as
if
he
have
be
send
express
to
tell
them
a
long
story
,
that
the
people
who
have
burn
their
Cham
-
Chi
-
Thaungu
be
go
to
Sibeilka
,
with
a
caravan
of
miscreant
,
as
he
call
them
;
that
be
to
say
,
Christians
;
and
that
they
be
resolve
to
burn
the
god
Seal
Isarg
,
belong
to
the
Tonguses
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
fellow
be
a
mere
Tartar
,
and
perfectly
speak
their
language
,
he
counterfeit
so
well
,
that
they
all
take
it
from
him
,
and
away
they
drive
,
in
a
most
violent
hurry
,
to
Sibeilka
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
five
day
journey
to
the
south
;
and
in
less
than
three
hour
they
be
entirely
out
of
our
sight
,
and
we
never
hear
any
more
of
them
,
nor
ever
know
whether
they
go
to
that
other
place
call
Sibeilka
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
so
we
pass
safely
on
to
the
city
of
Jarawena
,
where
there
be
a
garrison
of
Muscovites
;
and
there
we
rest
five
day
,
the
caravan
be
exceedingly
fatigue
with
the
last
day
's
march
,
and
with
want
of
rest
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
city
we
have
a
frightful
desert
,
which
hold
us
three
-
and
-
twenty
day
march
.
<EOS>
We
furnish
ourselves
with
some
tent
here
,
for
the
well
accommodate
ourselves
in
the
night
;
and
the
leader
of
the
caravan
procure
sixteen
carriage
,
or
waggon
,
of
the
country
,
for
carry
our
water
and
provision
;
and
these
carriage
be
our
defence
<EOS>
every
night
round
our
little
camp
;
so
that
have
the
Tartars
appear
,
unless
they
have
be
very
numerous
indeed
,
they
would
not
have
be
able
to
hurt
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
well
be
suppose
to
want
rest
again
after
this
long
journey
;
for
in
this
desert
we
see
neither
house
or
tree
,
or
scarce
a
bush
:
we
see
,
indeed
,
abundance
of
the
sable
-
hunter
,
as
they
call
them
.
<EOS>
these
be
all
tartar
of
the
Mogul
Tartary
,
of
which
this
country
be
a
part
;
and
they
frequently
attack
small
caravan
;
but
we
see
no
number
of
them
together
.
<EOS>
I
be
curious
to
see
the
sable
skin
they
catch
;
but
I
could
never
speak
with
any
of
them
;
for
they
durst
not
come
near
us
;
neither
durst
we
straggle
from
our
company
to
go
near
them
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
pass
this
desert
,
we
come
into
a
country
pretty
well
inhabited
;
that
be
to
say
,
we
find
town
and
castle
settle
by
the
czar
of
Muscovy
,
with
garrison
of
stationary
soldier
to
protect
the
caravan
,
and
defend
the
country
against
the
Tartars
,
who
would
otherwise
make
it
very
dangerous
travelling
;
and
his
czarish
majesty
have
give
such
strict
order
for
the
well
guard
the
caravan
and
merchant
,
that
if
there
be
any
Tartars
hear
of
in
the
country
,
detachment
of
the
garrison
be
always
send
to
see
traveller
safe
from
station
to
station
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
the
governor
of
Adinskoy
,
whom
I
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
visit
to
,
by
mean
of
the
Scots
merchant
,
who
be
acquaint
with
him
,
offer
us
a
guard
of
fifty
man
,
if
we
think
there
be
any
danger
,
to
the
next
station
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
long
before
this
,
that
as
we
come
nearer
to
Europe
we
should
find
the
country
better
people
,
and
the
people
more
civilized
;
but
I
find
myself
mistaken
in
both
,
for
we
have
yet
the
nation
of
the
tonguse
to
pass
through
;
where
we
see
the
same
token
of
paganism
and
barbarity
,
or
bad
,
than
before
;
only
as
they
be
conquer
by
the
Muscovites
,
and
entirely
reduce
,
they
be
not
so
dangerous
;
but
for
the
rudeness
of
manner
,
idolatry
,
and
polytheism
,
no
people
in
the
world
ever
go
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
clothe
all
in
skin
of
beast
,
and
their
house
be
build
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
a
man
from
a
woman
,
neither
by
the
ruggedness
of
their
countenance
,
or
their
clothe
;
and
in
the
winter
,
when
the
ground
be
cover
with
snow
,
they
live
under
ground
,
in
house
like
vault
,
which
have
cavity
or
cave
go
from
one
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
Tartars
have
their
Cham
-
Chi
-
Thaungu
for
a
whole
village
,
or
country
,
these
have
idol
in
every
hut
and
every
cave
;
besides
,
they
worship
the
star
,
the
sun
,
the
water
,
the
snow
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
every
thing
that
they
do
not
understand
,
and
they
understand
but
very
little
;
so
that
almost
every
element
,
every
uncommon
thing
,
set
them
a
-
sacrificing
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
no
more
to
describe
people
than
country
,
any
farther
than
my
own
story
come
to
be
concern
in
them
.
<EOS>
I
meet
with
nothing
peculiar
to
myself
in
all
this
country
,
which
I
reckon
be
,
from
the
desert
which
I
speak
of
last
,
at
least
four
hundred
mile
,
half
of
it
be
another
desert
,
which
take
us
up
twelve
day
severe
travelling
,
without
house
,
tree
,
or
bush
;
but
we
be
oblige
again
to
carry
our
own
provision
,
as
well
water
as
bread
.
<EOS>
after
we
be
out
of
this
desert
,
and
have
travel
two
day
,
we
come
to
Janezay
,
a
Muscovite
city
or
station
,
on
the
great
river
Janezay
.
<EOS>
this
river
,
they
tell
us
,
part
Europe
from
Asia
,
though
our
map
-
maker
,
as
I
be
tell
,
do
not
agree
to
it
;
however
,
it
be
certainly
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
ancient
Siberia
,
which
now
make
a
province
only
of
the
vast
Muscovite
empire
,
but
be
itself
equal
in
bigness
to
the
whole
empire
of
Germany
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
here
I
observe
ignorance
and
paganism
,
still
prevail
,
except
in
the
Muscovite
garrison
.
<EOS>
all
the
country
between
the
river
Oby
and
the
river
Janezay
be
as
entirely
pagan
,
and
the
people
as
barbarous
,
as
the
remotest
of
the
Tartars
;
nay
,
as
any
nation
,
for
aught
I
know
,
in
Asia
or
America
.
<EOS>
I
also
find
,
which
I
observe
to
the
Muscovite
governor
,
whom
I
have
opportunity
to
converse
with
,
that
the
pagan
be
not
much
the
wise
,
or
the
near
Christianity
,
for
be
under
the
Muscovite
government
;
which
they
acknowledge
be
true
enough
,
but
,
they
say
,
it
be
none
of
their
business
;
that
if
the
czar
expect
to
convert
his
siberian
,
or
Tonguese
,
or
Tartar
subject
,
it
should
be
do
by
send
clergyman
among
them
,
not
soldier
;
and
they
add
,
with
more
sincerity
than
I
expect
,
that
they
find
it
be
not
so
much
the
concern
of
their
monarch
to
make
the
people
Christians
,
as
it
be
to
make
them
subject
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
river
to
the
great
river
Oby
,
we
cross
a
wild
uncultivated
country
;
I
can
not
say
'
tis
a
barbarous
soil
;
'
tis
only
barren
of
people
,
and
want
good
management
;
otherwise
it
be
in
itself
a
most
pleasant
,
fruitful
,
and
agreeable
country
.
<EOS>
what
inhabitant
we
find
in
it
be
all
pagan
,
except
such
as
be
send
among
them
from
Russia
;
for
this
be
the
country
,
I
mean
on
both
side
the
river
Oby
,
whither
the
Muscovite
criminal
,
that
be
not
put
to
death
,
be
banish
,
and
from
whence
it
be
next
to
impossible
they
should
ever
come
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
material
to
say
of
my
particular
affair
,
till
I
come
to
Tobolski
,
the
capital
of
Siberia
,
where
I
continue
some
time
on
the
follow
occasion
:
    
<EOS>
We
have
be
now
almost
seven
month
on
our
journey
,
and
winter
begin
to
come
on
apace
;
whereupon
my
partner
and
I
call
a
council
about
our
particular
affair
,
in
which
we
find
it
proper
,
consider
that
we
be
bind
for
England
,
and
not
for
Moscow
,
to
consider
how
to
dispose
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
of
sledge
and
rein
-
deer
to
carry
us
over
the
snow
in
the
winter
-
time
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
have
such
thing
,
as
it
would
be
incredible
to
relate
the
particular
of
,
by
which
mean
the
Russians
travel
more
in
the
winter
than
they
can
in
summer
;
because
in
these
sledge
they
be
able
to
run
night
and
day
:
the
snow
be
freeze
,
be
one
universal
covering
to
nature
,
by
which
the
hill
,
the
vale
,
the
river
,
the
lake
,
be
all
smooth
,
and
hard
as
a
stone
;
and
they
run
upon
the
surface
,
without
any
regard
to
what
be
underneath
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
occasion
to
push
at
a
winter
journey
of
this
kind
;
I
be
bind
to
England
,
not
to
Moscow
,
and
my
route
lie
two
way
:
either
I
must
go
on
as
the
caravan
go
,
till
I
come
to
Jarislaw
,
and
then
go
off
west
for
Narva
,
and
the
gulf
of
Finland
,
and
so
either
by
sea
or
land
to
Dantzic
,
where
I
may
possibly
sell
my
China
cargo
to
good
advantage
;
or
I
must
leave
the
caravan
at
a
little
town
on
the
Dwina
,
from
whence
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
six
day
by
water
to
Archangel
,
and
<EOS>
from
thence
may
be
sure
of
shipping
,
either
to
England
,
Holland
,
or
Hamburgh
.
  
<EOS>
now
to
go
any
of
these
journie
in
the
winter
would
have
be
preposterous
;
for
as
to
Dantzic
,
the
Baltic
would
be
freeze
up
,
and
I
could
not
get
passage
;
and
to
go
by
land
in
those
country
,
be
far
less
safe
than
among
the
Mogul
Tartars
;
likewise
to
Archangel
,
in
October
all
the
ship
would
be
go
from
thence
,
and
even
the
merchant
,
who
dwell
there
in
summer
,
retire
south
to
Moscow
in
the
winter
,
when
the
ship
be
go
;
so
that
I
should
have
nothing
but
extremity
of
cold
to
encounter
,
with
a
scarcity
of
provision
,
and
must
lie
there
in
an
empty
town
all
the
winter
:
so
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
think
it
much
my
well
way
to
let
the
caravan
go
,
and
to
make
provision
to
winter
where
I
be
,
viz
.
<EOS>
at
Tobolski
,
in
Siberia
,
in
the
latitude
of
sixty
degree
,
where
I
be
sure
of
three
thing
to
wear
out
a
cold
winter
with
,
viz
.
<EOS>
plenty
of
provision
,
such
as
the
country
afford
,
a
warm
house
,
with
fuel
enough
,
and
excellent
company
;
of
all
which
I
shall
give
a
full
account
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
a
quite
different
climate
from
my
beloved
island
,
where
I
never
feel
cold
,
except
when
I
have
my
ague
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
much
to
do
to
bear
my
clothe
on
my
back
,
and
never
make
any
fire
but
without
door
,
for
my
necessity
,
in
dress
my
food
,
&
c.
<EOS>
now
I
make
me
three
good
vest
,
with
large
robe
or
gown
over
them
,
to
hang
down
to
the
foot
,
and
button
close
to
the
wrist
,
and
all
these
line
with
fur
,
to
make
them
sufficiently
warm
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
a
warm
house
,
I
must
confess
,
I
greatly
dislike
our
way
in
England
,
of
make
fire
in
every
room
in
the
house
,
in
open
chimnie
,
which
,
when
the
fire
be
out
,
always
keep
the
air
in
the
room
cold
as
the
climate
.
<EOS>
but
take
an
apartment
in
a
good
house
in
the
town
,
I
order
a
chimney
to
be
build
like
a
furnace
,
in
the
centre
of
six
several
room
,
like
a
stove
;
the
funnel
to
carry
the
smoke
go
up
one
way
,
the
door
to
come
at
the
fire
go
in
another
,
and
all
the
room
be
keep
equally
warm
,
but
no
fire
see
;
like
as
they
heat
the
bagnio
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
means
we
have
always
the
same
climate
in
all
the
room
,
and
an
equal
heat
be
preserve
;
and
how
cold
soever
it
be
without
,
it
be
always
warm
within
;
and
yet
we
see
no
fire
,
nor
be
ever
incommode
with
any
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
be
,
that
it
should
be
possible
to
meet
with
good
company
here
,
in
a
country
so
barbarous
as
that
of
the
most
northerly
part
of
Europe
,
near
the
Frozen
ocean
,
and
within
but
a
very
few
degree
of
Nova
Zembla
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
country
where
the
state
criminal
of
Muscovy
,
as
I
observe
before
,
be
all
banish
;
this
city
be
full
of
nobleman
,
prince
,
gentleman
,
colonel
,
and
,
in
short
,
all
degree
of
the
nobility
,
gentry
,
soldiery
,
and
courtier
of
Muscovy
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
famous
prince
Galilfken
,
or
Galoffken
,
and
his
son
;
the
old
general
Robostisky
,
and
several
other
person
of
note
,
and
some
lady
.
  
<EOS>
by
mean
of
my
Scots
merchant
,
whom
,
nevertheless
,
I
part
with
here
,
I
make
an
acquaintance
with
several
of
these
gentleman
,
and
some
of
them
of
the
first
rank
;
and
from
these
,
in
the
long
winter
night
,
in
which
I
staid
here
,
I
receive
several
agreeable
visit
.
<EOS>
It
be
talk
one
night
with
a
certain
prince
,
one
of
the
banished
minister
of
state
belong
to
the
czar
of
Muscovy
,
that
my
talk
of
my
particular
case
begin
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
me
abundance
of
fine
thing
,
of
the
greatness
,
the
magnificence
,
and
dominion
,
and
the
absolute
power
of
the
emperor
of
the
Russians
.
<EOS>
I
interrupt
him
,
and
tell
him
,
I
be
a
great
and
more
powerful
prince
than
ever
the
czar
of
Muscovy
be
,
though
my
dominion
be
not
so
large
,
or
my
people
so
many
.
<EOS>
the
russian
grandee
look
a
little
surprised
,
and
fix
his
eye
steadily
upon
me
,
begin
to
wonder
what
I
mean
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
his
wonder
would
cease
when
I
have
explain
myself
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
tell
him
,
I
have
the
absolute
disposal
of
the
life
and
fortune
of
all
my
subject
:
that
notwithstanding
my
absolute
power
,
I
have
not
one
person
disaffect
to
my
government
or
to
my
person
,
in
all
my
dominion
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
at
that
,
and
say
,
there
,
indeed
,
I
outdo
the
czar
of
Muscovy
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
that
all
the
land
in
my
kingdom
be
my
own
,
and
all
my
subject
be
not
only
my
tenant
,
but
tenant
at
will
;
that
they
would
all
fight
for
me
to
the
last
drop
;
and
that
never
tyrant
,
for
such
I
acknowledge
myself
to
be
,
be
ever
so
universally
beloved
,
and
yet
so
horribly
fear
,
by
his
subject
.
  
<EOS>
after
amuse
them
with
these
riddle
in
government
for
awhile
,
I
open
the
case
,
and
tell
them
the
story
at
large
of
my
living
in
the
island
,
and
how
I
manage
both
myself
and
the
people
there
that
be
under
me
,
just
as
I
have
since
minute
it
down
.
<EOS>
They
be
exceedingly
take
with
the
story
,
and
especially
the
prince
,
who
tell
me
with
a
sigh
,
that
the
true
greatness
of
life
be
to
be
master
of
ourselves
;
that
he
would
not
have
change
such
a
state
of
life
as
mine
,
to
have
be
czar
of
Muscovy
,
and
that
he
find
more
felicity
in
the
retirement
he
seem
to
be
banish
to
there
,
than
ever
he
find
in
the
high
authority
he
enjoy
in
the
court
of
his
master
the
czar
:
that
the
height
of
human
wisdom
be
to
bring
our
temper
down
to
our
circumstance
,
and
to
make
a
calm
within
,
under
the
weight
of
the
great
storm
,
without
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
first
hither
,
he
say
,
he
use
to
tear
the
hair
from
his
head
,
and
the
clothe
from
his
back
,
as
other
have
do
before
him
;
but
a
little
time
and
consideration
have
make
him
look
into
himself
,
as
well
as
round
himself
,
to
thing
without
:
that
he
find
the
mind
of
man
,
if
it
be
but
once
bring
to
reflect
upon
the
state
of
universal
life
,
and
how
little
this
world
be
concern
in
its
true
felicity
,
be
perfectly
capable
of
make
a
felicity
for
itself
,
fully
satisfy
to
itself
,
and
suitable
to
its
own
good
end
and
desire
,
with
but
very
little
assistance
from
the
world
;
that
air
to
breathe
in
,
food
to
sustain
life
,
clothe
for
warmth
,
and
liberty
for
exercise
,
in
order
to
health
,
complete
,
in
his
opinion
,
all
that
the
world
could
do
for
us
:
and
though
the
greatness
,
the
authority
,
the
rich
,
and
the
pleasure
,
which
some
enjoy
in
the
world
,
and
which
he
have
enjoy
his
share
of
,
have
much
in
them
that
be
agreeable
to
us
,
yet
he
observe
,
that
all
those
thing
chiefly
gratify
the
coarse
of
our
affection
;
such
as
our
ambition
,
our
particular
pride
,
our
avarice
,
our
vanity
,
and
our
sensuality
;
all
which
be
,
indeed
,
the
mere
product
of
the
bad
part
of
man
,
be
in
themselves
crime
,
and
have
in
them
the
seed
of
all
manner
of
crime
;
but
neither
be
relate
to
,
or
concern
with
,
any
of
those
virtue
that
constitute
us
wise
man
,
or
of
those
grace
which
distinguish
us
as
Christians
;
that
be
now
deprive
of
all
the
fancied
felicity
which
he
enjoy
in
the
full
exercise
of
all
those
vice
,
he
say
,
he
be
at
leisure
to
look
upon
the
dark
side
of
them
,
where
he
find
all
manner
of
deformity
;
and
be
now
convince
,
that
virtue
only
make
a
man
truly
wise
,
rich
,
and
great
,
and
preserve
him
in
the
way
to
a
superior
happiness
in
a
future
state
;
and
in
this
,
he
say
,
they
be
more
happy
in
their
banishment
,
than
all
their
enemy
be
,
who
have
the
full
possession
of
all
the
wealth
and
power
that
they
(
the
banished
)
have
leave
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
I
bring
my
mind
to
this
politically
,
by
the
necessity
of
my
circumstance
,
which
some
call
miserable
;
but
if
I
know
any
thing
of
myself
,
I
would
not
go
back
,
no
not
though
my
master
,
the
czar
,
should
call
me
,
and
offer
to
reinstate
me
in
all
my
former
grandeur
;
I
say
,
I
would
no
more
go
back
to
it
,
than
I
believe
my
soul
,
when
it
shall
be
deliver
from
this
prison
of
the
body
,
and
have
have
a
taste
of
the
glorious
state
beyond
life
,
would
come
back
to
the
gaol
of
flesh
and
blood
<EOS>
it
be
now
enclose
in
,
and
leave
Heaven
to
deal
in
the
dirt
and
grime
of
human
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spake
this
with
so
much
warmth
in
his
temper
,
so
much
earnestness
and
motion
of
his
spirit
,
which
be
apparent
in
his
countenance
,
that
it
be
evident
it
be
the
true
sense
of
his
soul
;
and
indeed
there
be
no
room
to
doubt
his
sincerity
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
once
think
myself
a
kind
of
a
monarch
in
my
old
station
,
of
which
I
have
give
him
an
account
,
but
that
I
think
he
be
not
a
monarch
only
,
but
a
great
conqueror
;
for
that
he
that
have
get
a
victory
over
his
own
exorbitant
desire
,
and
have
the
absolute
dominion
over
himself
,
and
whose
reason
entirely
govern
his
will
,
be
certainly
great
than
he
that
conquer
a
city
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
my
lord
,
"
say
I
,
"
shall
I
take
the
liberty
to
ask
you
a
question
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
the
door
of
your
liberty
be
open
,
"
say
I
,
"
would
not
you
take
hold
of
it
to
deliver
yourself
from
this
exile
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hold
,
"
say
he
,
"
your
question
be
subtle
,
and
require
some
serious
just
distinction
to
give
it
a
sincere
answer
;
and
I
will
give
it
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart

<EOS>
nothing
that
I
know
of
in
this
world
would
move
me
to
deliver
myself
from
the
state
of
banishment
,
except
these
two
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
enjoyment
of
my
relation
;
and
secondly
,
a
little
warm
climate
.
<EOS>
but
I
protest
to
you
,
that
to
go
back
to
the
pomp
of
the
court
,
the
glory
,
the
power
,
the
hurry
of
a
minister
of
state
;
the
wealth
,
the
gaiety
,
and
the
pleasure
,
that
be
to
say
,
folly
of
a
courtier
;
if
my
master
should
send
me
word
this
moment

that
he
restore
me
to
all
he
banish
me
from
,
I
protest

I
know
myself
at
all
,
I
would
not
leave
this
wilderness
,
these
desert
,
and
these
frozen
lake
,
for
the
palace
of
Moscow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
,
my
lord
,
"
say
I
,
"
perhaps
you
not
only
be
banish
from
the
pleasure
of
the
court
,
and
from
the
power
,
and
authority
,
and
wealth
,
you
enjoy
before
,
but
you
may
be
absent
too
from
some
of
the
conveniencie
of
life
;
your
estate
,
perhaps
,
confiscate
,
and
your
effect
plunder
;
and
the
supply
leave
you
here
may
not
be
suitable
to
the
ordinary
demand
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
is
,
as
you
suppose
me
to
be
a
lord
,
or
a
prince
,
&
c.
<EOS>
so
indeed
I
be
;
but
you
be
now
to
consider
me
only
as
a
man
,
a
human
creature
,
not
at
all
distinguish
from
another
;
and
so
I
can
suffer
no
want
,
unless
I
should
be
visit
with
sickness
and
distemper
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
put
the
question
out
of
dispute
;
you
see
our
manner
;
we
be
in
this
place
five
person
of
rank
;
we
live
perfectly
retire
;
as
suit
to
a
state
of
banishment
;
we
have
something
rescue
from
the
shipwreck
of
our
fortune
,
which
keep
us
from
the
mere
necessity
of
hunting
for
our
food
;
but
the
poor
soldier
who
be
here
,
without
that
help
,
live
in
as
much
plenty
as
we
.
<EOS>
They
go
into
the
wood
,
and
catch
sable
and
fox
;
the
labour
of
a
month
will
maintain
them
a
year
;
and
as
the
way
of
living
be
not
expensive
,
so
it
be
not
hard
to
get
sufficient
to
ourselves
:
so
that
objection
be
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
room
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
most
agreeable
conversation
I
have
with
this
truly
great
man
;
in
all
which
he
shew
,
that
his
mind
be
so
inspire
with
a
superior
knowledge
of
thing
,
so
support
by
religion
,
as
well
as
by
a
vast
share
of
wisdom
,
that
his
contempt
of
the
world
be
really
as
much
as
he
have
express
,
and
that
he
be
always
the
same
to
the
last
,
as
will
appear
in
the
story
I
be
go
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
here
eight
month
,
and
a
dark
dreadful
winter
I
think
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
the
cold
be
so
intense
,
that
I
could
not
so
much
as
look
abroad
without
be
wrapt
in
fur
,
and
a
mask
of
fur
before
my
face
,
or
rather
a
hood
,
with
only
a
hole
for
breath
,
and
two
for
sight
.
<EOS>
the
little
daylight
we
have
,
as
we
reckon
,
for
three
month
,
not
above
five
hour
a
day
,
or
six
at
most
;
only
that
the
snow
lie
on
the
ground
continually
,
and
the
weather
be
clear
,
it
be
never
quite
dark
.
<EOS>
Our
horse
be
keep
(
or
rather
starve
)
under
ground
;
and
as
for
our
servant
,
(
for
we
hire
servant
here
to
look
after
our
horse
and
ourselves
)
<EOS>
we
have
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
their
finger
and
toe
to
thaw
,
and
take
care
of
,
lest
they
should
mortify
and
fall
off
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
within
door
we
be
warm
,
the
house
be
close
,
the
wall
thick
,
<EOS>
the
light
small
,
and
the
glass
all
double
.
<EOS>
Our
food
be
chiefly
the
flesh
of
deer
,
dry
and
cure
in
the
season
;
good
bread
enough
,
but
bake
as
biscuit
;
dry
fish
of
several
sort
,
and
some
flesh
of
mutton
,
and
of
buffalo
,
which
be
pretty
good
beef
.
<EOS>
all
the
store
of
provision
for
the
winter
be
lay
up
in
the
summer
,
and
well
cure
.
<EOS>
Our
drink
be
water
mix
with
aqua
vitae
instead
of
brandy
;
and
,
for
a
treat
,
mead
instead
of
wine
;
which
,
however
,
they
have
excellent
good
.
<EOS>
the
hunter
,
who
venture
abroad
all
weather
,
frequently
bring
us
in
fresh
venison
,
very
fat
and
good
;
and
sometimes
bear
's
flesh
,
but
we
do
not
much
care
for
the
last
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
good
stock
of
tea
,
with
which
we
treat
our
friend
as
above
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
we
live
very
cheerfully
and
well
,
all
thing
consider
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
March
,
and
the
day
grow
considerably
longer
,
and
the
weather
at
least
tolerable
;
so
other
traveller
begin
to
prepare
sledge
to
carry
them
over
the
snow
,
and
to
get
thing
ready
to
be
go
;
but
my
measure
be
fix
,
as
I
have
say
,
for
Archangel
,
and
not
for
Muscovy
or
the
Baltic
,
I
make
no
motion
,
know
very
well
,
that
the
ship
from
the
south
do
not
set
out
for
that
part
of
the
world
till
May
or
June
;
and
that
if
I
be
there
at
the
beginning
of
August
,
it
would
be
as
soon
as
any
ship
would
be
ready
to
go
away
;
and
therefore
,
I
say
,
I
make
no
haste
to
be
go
,
as
other
do
;
in
a
word
,
I
see
a
great
many
people
,
nay
,
all
the
traveller
,
go
away
before
me
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
every
year
they
go
from
thence
to
Moscow
for
trade
;
viz
.
<EOS>
to
carry
fur
,
and
buy
necessary
with
them
,
which
they
bring
back
to
furnish
their
shop
;
also
other
go
on
the
same
errand
to
Archangel
;
but
then
they
also
,
be
to
come
back
again
above
eight
hundred
mile
,
go
all
out
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
about
the
latter
end
of
May
I
begin
to
make
all
ready
to
pack
up
;
and
as
I
be
do
this
,
it
occur
to
me
,
that
see
all
these
people
be
banish
by
the
czar
of
Muscovy
to
Siberia
,
and
yet
,
when
they
come
there
,
be
at
liberty
to
go
whither
they
would
;
why
do
they
not
then
go
away
to
any
part
of
the
world
wherever
they
think
fit
?
<EOS>
and
I
begin
to
examine
what
should
hinder
them
from
make
such
an
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
wonder
be
over
,
when
I
entreat
upon
that
subject
with
the
person
I
have
mention
,
who
answer
me
thus
:
"
consider
,
first
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
place
where
we
be
;
and
,
secondly
,
the
condition
we
be
in
;
especially
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
generality
of
the
people
who
be
banish
hither
.
<EOS>
We
be
surround
,
"
say
he
,
"
with
strong
thing
than
bar
and
bolt
:
on
the
north
side
be
an
unnavigable
ocean
,
where
ship
never
sail
,
and
boat
never
swam
;
neither
,
if
we
have
both
,
could
we
know
whither
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
every
other
way
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
have
above
a
thousand
mile
to
pass
through
the
czar
's
own
dominion
,
and
by
way
utterly
impassable
,
except
by
the
road
make
by
the
government
,
and
through
the
town
garrison
by
its
troop
;
so
that
we
could
neither
pass
undiscovered
by
the
road
,
or
subsist
any
other
way
:
so
that
it
be
in
vain
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
silence
indeed
,
at
once
,
and
find
that
they
be
in
a
prison
,
every
jot
as
secure
as
if
they
have
be
lock
up
in
the
castle
of
Moscow
;
however
,
it
come
into
my
thought
,
that
I
may
certainly
be
make
an
instrument
to
procure
the
escape
of
this
excellent
person
,
and
that
it
be
very
easy
for
me
to
carry
him
away
,
there
be
no
guard
over
him
in
the
country
;
and
as
I
be
not
go
to
Moscow
,
but
to
Archangel
,
and
that
I
go
in
the
nature
of
a
caravan
,
by
which
I
be
not
oblige
to
lie
in
the
stationary
town
in
the
desert
,
but
could
encamp
every
night
where
I
would
,
may
easily
pass
uninterrupted
to
Archangel
,
where
I
could
immediately
secure
him
on
board
an
english
or
dutch
ship
,
and
carry
him
off
safe
along
with
me
;
and
as
to
his
subsistence
,
and
other
particular
,
that
should
be
my
care
,
till
he
should
better
supply
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
hear
me
very
attentively
,
and
look
earnestly
on
me
all
the
while
I
speak
;
nay
,
I
could
see
in
his
very
face
,
that
what
I
say
put
his
spirit
into
an
exceed
ferment
;
his
colour
frequently
change
,
his
eye
look
red
,
and
his
heart
flutter
,
that
it
may
be
even
perceive
in
his
countenance
;
nor
could
he
immediately
answer
me
when
I
have
do
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
expect
what
he
would
say
to
it
;
and
after
he
have
pause
a
little
,
he
embrace
me
,
and
say
,
"
how
unhappy
be
we
!
<EOS>
unguided
creature
as
we
be
,
that
even
our
great
act
of
friendship
be
make
snare
to
us
,
and
we
be
make
tempter
of
one
another
!
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
your
offer
be
so
sincere
,
have
such
kindness
in
it
,
be
so
disintereste
in
itself
,
and
be
so
calculated
for
my
advantage
,
that
I
must
have
very
little
knowledge
of
the
world
,
if
I
do
not
both
wonder
at
it
,
and
acknowledge
the
obligation
I
have
upon
me
to
you
for
it
:
but
do
you
believe
I
be
sincere
in
what
I
have
so
often
say
to
you
of
my
contempt
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
do
you
believe
I
speak
my
very
soul
to
you
,
and
that
I
have
really
maintain
that
degree
of
felicity
here
,
that
have
place
me
above
all
that
the
world
could
give
me
,
or
do
for
me
?
<EOS>
do
you
believe
I
be
sincere
,
when
I
tell
you
I
would
not
go
back
,
if
I
be
recall
even
to
be
all
that
once
I
be
in
the
court
,
and
with
the
favour
of
the
czar
my
master
?
<EOS>
do
you
believe
me
,
my
friend
,
to
be
an
honest
man
,
or
do
you
think
me
to
be
a
boasting
hypocrite
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
he
stop
,
as
if
he
would
hear
what
I
would
say
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
soon
after
perceive
,
that
he
stop
because
his
spirit
be
in
motion
:
his
heart
be
full
of
struggle
,
and
he
could
not
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
I
confess
,
astonish
at
the
thing
,
as
well
as
at
the
man
,
and
I
use
some
argument
with
him
to
urge
him
to
set
himself
free
;
that
he
ought
to
look
upon
this
as
a
door
open
by
Heaven
for
his
deliverance
,
and
a
summon
by
Providence
,
who
have
the
care
and
good
disposition
of
all
event
,
to
do
himself
good
,
and
to
render
himself
useful
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
by
this
time
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
warmly
,
"
but
that
,
instead
of
a
summon
from
Heaven
,
it
may
be
a
feint
of
another
instrument
,
represent
,
in
all
the
alluring
colour
to
me
,
the
show
of
felicity
as
a
deliverance
,
which
may
in
itself
be
my
snare
,
and
tend
directly
to
my
ruin
?
<EOS>
here
I
be
free
from
the
temptation
of
return
to
my
former
miserable
greatness
;
there
I
be
not
sure
,
but
that
all
the
seed
of
pride
,
ambition
,
avarice
,
and
luxury
,
which
I
know
remain
in
my
nature
,
may
revive
and
take
root
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
again
overwhelm
me
;
and
then
the
happy
prisoner
,
whom
you
see
now
master
of
his
soul
's
liberty
,
shall
be
the
miserable
slave
of
his
own
sense
,
in
the
full
possession
of
all
personal
liberty
.
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
let
me
remain
in
this
bless
confinement
,
banish
from
the
crime
of
life
,
rather
than
purchase
a
show
of
freedom
at
the
expense
of
the
liberty
of
my
reason
,
and
at
the
expense
of
the
future
happiness
which
now
I
have
in
my
view
,
but
shall
then
,
I
fear
,
quickly
lose
sight
of
;
for
I
be
but
flesh
,
a
man
,
a
mere
man
,
have
passion
and
affection
as
likely
to
possess
and
overthrow
me
as
any
man
:
o
be
not
my
friend
and
my
tempter
both
together
!
"
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
surprised
before
,
I
be
quite
dumb
now
,
and
stand
silent
,
look
at
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
admire
what
I
see
.
<EOS>
the
struggle
in
his
soul
be
so
great
,
that
,
though
the
weather
be
extremely
cold
,
it
put
him
into
a
most
violent
sweat
,
and
I
find
he
want
to
give
vent
to
his
mind
;
so
I
say
a
word
or
two
,
that
I
would
leave
him
to
consider
of
it
,
and
wait
on
him
again
;
and
then
I
withdraw
to
my
own
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
,
I
hear
somebody
at
or
near
the
door
of
the
room
,
and
I
be
go
to
open
the
door
;
but
he
have
open
it
,
and
come
in
:
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
have
almost
overset
me
,
but
I
be
recover
:
<EOS>
do
not
take
it
ill
that
I
do
not
close
with
your
offer
;
I
assure
you
,
it
be
not
for
want
of
a
sense
of
the
kindness
of
it
in
you
;
and
I
come
to
make
the
most
sincere
acknowledgment
of
it
to
you
;

,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
I
have
get
the
victory
over
myself
.

"
My
lord

I

I
hope
you
be
fully
satisfied

that
you

not
resist
the
call
of
Heaven

"
Sir

he
,
"
if
it
have
be
from
Heaven

the

have
influence
me
to
accept

I
hope
,

be
fully
satisfied

that
it

from

I
decline
it

I
have
an
infinite
satisfaction
in
the
parting

leave
me
an
honest
man
still

"
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do

to
acquiesce
,
and
make
profession
to
him
of
my
have
no
end
in
it
,

a
sincere
desire
to
serve
him

He
embrace
me
very
passionately
,

assure
me
,
he
be
sensible
of
that
,

should
always
acknowledge
it
:
and
with
that
he
offer
me
a
very
fine
present
of
sable
,
too
much
indeed
for
me
to
accept
from
a
man
in
his
circumstance
;
and
I
would
have
avoid
them
,
but
he
would
not
be
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
send
my
servant
to
his
lordship
,
with
a
small
present
of
tea
,
two
piece
of
China
damask
,
and
four
little
wedge
of
Japan
gold
,
which
,
do
not
all
weigh
above
six
ounce
,
or
thereabout
;
but
be
far
short
of
the
value
of
his
sable
,
which
indeed
,
when
I
come
to
England
,
I
find
worth
near
two
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
He
accept
the
tea
,
and
one
piece
of
the
damask
,
and
one
of
the
piece
of
gold
,
which
have
a
fine
stamp
upon
it
,
of
the
Japan
coinage
,
which
I
find
he
take
for
the
rarity
of
it
,
but
would
not
take
any
more
;
and
send
word
by
my
servant
,
that
he
desire
to
speak
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
him
,
he
tell
me
,
I
know
what
have
pass
between
us
,
and
hope
I
would
not
move
him
any
more
in
that
affair
;
but
that
,
since
I
make
such
a
generous
offer
to
him
,
he
ask
me
,
if
I
have
kindness
enough
to
offer
the
same
to
another
person
that
he
would
name
to
me
,
in
whom
he
have
a
great
share
of
concern
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
that
I
could
not
say
I
incline
to
do
so
much
for
any
one
but
himself
,
for
whom
I
have
a
particular
value
,
and
should
have
be
glad
to
have
be
the
instrument
of
his
deliverance
:
<EOS>
however
,
if
he
would
please
to
name
the
person
to
me
,
I
would
give
him
my
answer
,
and
hope
he
would
not
be
displeased
with
me
,
if
he
be
with
my
answer
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
it
be
only
his
son
,
who
,
though
I
have
not
see
,
yet
be
in
the
same
condition
with
himself
,
and
above
two
hundred
mile
from
him
,
on
the
other
side
the
Oby
;
but
that
,
if
I
consent
,
he
would
send
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
hesitation
,
but
tell
him
I
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
make
some
ceremony
in
let
him
understand
that
it
be
wholly
on
his
account
;
and
that
see
I
could
not
prevail
on
him
,
I
would
shew
my
respect
to
him
by
my
concern
for
his
son
:
but
these
thing
be
too
tedious
to
repeat
here
.
<EOS>
He
send
away
the
next
day
for
his
son
,
and
in
about
twenty
day
he
come
back
with
the
messenger
,
bring
six
or
seven
horse
load
with
very
rich
fur
,
and
which
,
in
the
whole
,
amount
to
a
very
great
value
.
  
<EOS>
His
servant
bring
the
horse
into
the
town
,
but
leave
the
young
lord
at
a
distance
till
night
,
when
he
come
incognito
into
our
apartment
,
and
his
father
present
him
to
me
;
and
,
in
short
,
we
concert
there
the
manner
of
our
travelling
,
and
every
thing
proper
for
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
buy
a
considerable
quantity
of
sable
,
black
fox
-
skin
,
fine
ermine
,
and
such
other
fur
that
be
very
rich
;
I
say
,
I
have
buy
them
in
that
city
for
exchange
for
some
of
the
good
bring
from
China
;
in
particular
,
for
the
clove
and
nutmeg
,
of
which
I
sell
the
great
part
here
;
and
the
rest
afterwards
at
Archangel
,
for
a
much
well
price
than
I
could
have
do
at
Louden
;
and
my
partner
,
who
be
sensible
of
the
profit
,
and
whose
business
,
more
particularly
than
mine
,
be
merchandise
,
be
mightily
pleased
with
our
stay
,
on
account
of
the
traffic
we
make
here
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
beginning
of
June
when
I
leave
this
remote
place
,
a
city
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
little
hear
of
in
the
world
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
be
so
far
out
of
the
road
of
commerce
,
that
I
know
not
how
it
should
be
much
talk
of
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
come
to
a
very
small
caravan
,
be
only
thirty
-
two
horse
and
camel
in
all
,
and
all
of
them
pass
for
mine
,
though
my
new
guest
be
proprietor
of
eleven
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
most
natural
also
,
that
I
should
take
more
servant
with
me
than
I
have
before
,
and
the
young
lord
pass
for
my
steward
;
what
great
man
I
pass
for
myself
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
neither
do
it
concern
me
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
We
have
here
the
bad
and
the
large
desert
to
pass
over
that
we
meet
with
in
all
the
journey
;
indeed
I
call
it
the
bad
,
because
the
way
be
very
deep
in
some
place
,
and
very
uneven
in
other
;
the
good
we
have
to
say
for
it
be
,
that
we
think
we
have
no
troop
of
tartar
and
robber
to
fear
,
and
that
they
never
come
on
this
side
the
river
Oby
,
or
at
least
but
very
seldom
;
but
we
find
it
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
My
young
lord
have
with
him
a
faithful
Muscovite
servant
,
or
rather
a
siberian
servant
,
who
be
perfectly
acquaint
with
the
country
;
and
who
lead
us
by
private
road
,
that
we
avoid
come
into
the
principal
town
and
city
upon
the
great
road
,
such
as
Tumen
,
Soloy
Kamaskoy
,
and
several
other
;
because
the
Muscovite
garrison
,
which
be
keep
there
,
be
very
curious
and
strict
in
their
observation
upon
traveller
,
and
search
lest
any
of
the
banished
person
of
note
should
make
their
escape
that
way
into
Muscovy
;
but
by
this
mean
,
as
we
be
keep
out
of
the
city
,
so
our
whole
journey
be
a
desert
,
and
we
be
oblige
to
encamp
and
lie
in
our
tent
,
when
we
may
have
have
good
accommodation
in
the
city
on
the
way
:
this
the
young
lord
be
so
sensible
of
,
that
he
would
not
allow
us
to
lie
abroad
,
when
we
come
to
several
city
on
the
way
;
but
lie
abroad
himself
,
with
his
servant
,
in
the
wood
,
and
meet
us
always
at
the
appoint
place
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
just
enter
Europe
,
have
pass
the
river
Kama
,
which
,
in
these
part
,
be
the
boundary
between
Europe
and
Asia
;
and
the
first
city
on
the
european
side
be
call
Soloy
Kamaskoy
,
which
be
as
much
as
to
say
,
the
great
city
on
the
river
Kama
;
and
here
we
think
to
have
see
some
evident
alteration
in
the
people
,
their
manner
,
their
habit
,
their
religion
,
and
their
business
;
but
we
be
mistaken
;
for
as
we
have
a
vast
desert
to
pass
,
which
,
by
relation
,
be
near
seven
hundred
mile
long
in
some
place
,
but
not
above
two
hundred
mile
over
where
we
pass
it
;
so
,
till
we
come
past
that
horrible
place
,
we
find
very
little
difference
between
that
country
and
the
Mogul
Tartary
;
the
people
mostly
Pagans
,
and
little
well
than
the
savage
of
America
;
their
house
and
town
full
of
idol
,
and
their
way
of
live
wholly
barbarous
,
except
in
the
city
as
above
,
and
the
village
near
them
;
where
they
be
Christians
,
as
they
call
themselves
,
of
the
greek
church
;
but
even
these
have
their
religion
mingle
with
so
many
relic
of
superstition
,
that
it
be
scarce
to
be
know
in
some
place
from
mere
sorcery
and
witchcraft
.
  
<EOS>
in
pass
this
forest
,
I
think
indeed
we
must
,
after
all
our
danger
be
,
in
our
imagination
,
escape
,
as
before
,
have
be
plunder
and
rob
,
and
perhaps
murder
,
by
a
troop
of
thief
:
of
what
country
they
be
;
whether
the
rove
band
of
the
Ostiachi
,
a
kind
of
tartar
,
or
wild
people
on
the
bank
of
the
Oby
,
have
range
thus
far
;
or
whether
they
be
the
sable
-
hunter
of
Siberia
,
I
be
yet
at
a
loss
to
know
;
but
they
be
all
on
horseback
,
carry
bow
and
arrow
,
and
be
at
first
about
five
-
and
-
forty
in
number
.
<EOS>
They
come
so
near
to
us
as
within
about
two
musket
shot
;
and
,
ask
no
question
,
they
surround
us
with
their
horse
,
and
look
very
earnestly
upon
us
twice
.
<EOS>
at
length
they
place
themselves
just
in
our
way
;
upon
which
we
draw
up
in
a
little
line
before
our
camel
,
be
not
above
sixteen
man
in
all
;
and
be
draw
up
thus
,
we
halt
,
and
send
out
the
siberian
servant
who
attend
his
lord
,
to
see
who
they
be
:
<EOS>
his
master
be
the
more
willing
to
let
him
go
,
because
he
be
not
a
little
apprehensive
that
they
be
a
siberian
troop
send
out
after
him
.
<EOS>
the
man
come
up
near
them
with
a
flag
of
truce
,
and
call
to
them
;
but
though
he
speak
several
of
their
language
,
or
dialect
of
language
<EOS>
rather
,
he
could
not
understand
a
word
they
say
:
however
,
after
some
sign
to
him
not
to
come
near
to
them
at
his
peril
,
so
he
say
he
understand
them
to
mean
,
offer
to
shoot
at
him
if
he
advance
,
the
fellow
come
back
<EOS>
no
wiser
than
he
go
<EOS>
,
only
that
by
their
dress
,
he
say
,
he
believe
them
to
be
some
tartar
of
Kalmuck
,
or
of
the
circassian
horde
;
and
that
there
must
be
more
of
them
on
the
great
desert
,
though
he
never
hear
that
ever
any
of
them
be
see
so
far
north
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
small
comfort
to
us
;
however
,
we
have
no
remedy
:
there
be
on
our
left
hand
,
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
's
distance
,
a
little
grove
or
clump
of
tree
,
which
stand
close
together
,
and
very
near
the
road
;
I
immediately
resolve
we
should
advance
to
those
tree
,
and
fortify
ourselves
as
well
as
we
could
there
;
for
,
first
,
I
consider
that
the
tree
would
in
a
great
measure
cover
us
from
their
arrow
;
and
in
the
next
place
,
they
could
not
come
to
charge
us
in
a
body
:
it
be
,
indeed
,
my
old
portuguese
pilot
who
propose
it
;
and
who
have
this
excellency
attend
him
,
namely
,
that
he
be
always
readiest
and
most
apt
to
direct
and
encourage
us
in
case
of
the
most
danger
.
<EOS>
We
advance
immediately
with
what
speed
we
could
,
and
gain
that
little
wood
,
the
Tartars
,
or
thief
,
for
we
know
not
what
to
call
them
,
keep
their
stand
,
and
not
attempt
to
hinder
us
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
thither
,
we
find
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
,
that
it
be
a
swampy
,
springy
piece
of
ground
,
and
,
on
the
other
side
,
a
great
spring
of
water
,
which
,
run
out
in
a
little
rill
or
brook
,
be
a
little
farther
join
by
another
of
the
like
bigness
;
and
be
,
in
short
,
the
head
or
source
of
a
considerable
river
,
call
afterwards
the
Wirtska
.
<EOS>
the
tree
which
grow
about
this
spring
be
not
in
all
above
two
hundred
,
but
be
very
large
,
and
stand
pretty
thick
;
so
that
as
soon
as
we
get
in
,
we
see
ourselves
perfectly
safe
from
the
enemy
,
unless
they
alight
and
attack
us
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
make
this
more
difficult
,
our
Portuguese
,
with
indefatigable
application
,
cut
down
great
arm
of
the
tree
,
and
lay
them
hang
,
not
cut
quite
off
,
from
one
tree
to
another
;
so
that
he
make
a
continued
fence
almost
round
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
staid
here
,
wait
the
motion
of
the
enemy
some
hour
,
without
perceive
they
make
any
offer
to
stir
;
when
about
two
hour
before
night
,
they
come
down
directly
upon
us
;
and
,
though
we
have
not
perceive
it
,
we
find
they
have
be
join
by
some
more
of
the
same
,
so
that
they
be
near
fourscore
horse
,
whereof
<EOS>
,
however
,
we
fancy
some
be
woman
.
<EOS>
They
come
in
till
they
be
within
half
a
shot
of
our
little
wood
,
when
we
fire
one
musket
without
ball
,
and
call
to
them
in
the
russian
tongue
,
to
know
what
they
want
,
and
bid
them
keep
off
;
but
,
as
if
they
know
nothing
of
what
we
say
,
they
come
on
with
a
double
fury
directly
to
the
wood
-
side
,
not
imagine
<EOS>
we
be
so
barricade
,
that
they
could
not
break
in
.
<EOS>
Our
old
pilot
be
our
captain
,
as
well
as
he
have
be
our
engineer
;
and
desire
of
us
,
not
to
fire
upon
them
till
they
come
within
pistol
shoot
,
that
we
may
be
sure
to
kill
;
and
that
,
when
we
do
fire
,
we
should
be
sure
to
take
good
aim
.
<EOS>
We
bade
him
give
the
word
of
command
;
which
he
delay
so
long
,
that
they
be
,
some
of
them
,
within
two
pike
length
of
us
when
we
fire
.
  
<EOS>
We
aim
so
true
,
(
or
Providence
direct
our
shot
so
sure
)
that
we
kill
fourteen
of
them
at
the
first
volley
,
and
wound
several
other
,
as
also
several
of
their
horse
;
for
we
have
all
of
us
load
our
piece
with
two
or
three
bullet
apiece
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
terribly
surprised
with
our
fire
,
and
retreat
immediately
about
one
hundred
rod
from
us
;
in
which
time
we
load
our
piece
again
,
and
,
see
them
keep
that
distance
,
we
sally
out
,
and
catch
four
or
five
of
their
horse
,
whose
rider
,
we
suppose
,
be
kill
;
and
come
up
to
the
dead
,
we
could
easily
perceive
they
be
tartar
,
but
know
not
from
what
country
,
or
how
they
come
to
make
an
excursion
such
an
unusual
length
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
after
,
they
make
a
motion
to
attack
us
again
,
and
ride
round
our
little
wood
,
to
see
where
else
they
may
break
in
;
but
find
us
always
ready
to
face
them
,
they
go
off
again
,
and
we
resolve
not
to
stir
from
the
place
for
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
We
sleep
but
little
,
you
may
be
sure
;
but
spend
the
most
part
of
the
night
in
strengthen
our
situation
,
and
barricade
the
entrance
into
the
wood
;
and
,
keep
a
strict
watch
,
we
wait
for
daylight
,
and
,
when
it
come
,
it
give
us
a
very
unwelcome
discovery
indeed
:
for
the
enemy
,
who
we
think
be
discourage
with
the
reception
they
have
meet
with
,
be
now
increase
to
no
less
than
three
hundred
,
and
have
set
up
eleven
or
twelve
hut
and
tent
,
as
if
they
be
resolve
to
besiege
us
;
and
this
little
camp
they
have
pitch
,
be
upon
the
open
plain
,
at
about
three
quarter
of
a
mile
from
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
indeed
surprised
at
this
discovery
;
and
now
,
I
confess
,
I
give
myself
over
for
lost
,
and
all
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
my
effect
do
not
lie
so
near
me
(
though
they
be
very
considerable
)
as
the
thought
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
such
barbarian
,
at
the
latter
end
of
my
journey
,
after
so
many
difficulty
and
hazard
as
I
have
go
through
;
and
even
in
sight
of
our
port
,
where
we
expect
safety
and
deliverance
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
partner
,
he
be
rage
:
he
declare
,
that
to
lose
his
good
would
be
his
ruin
;
and
he
would
rather
die
than
be
starve
;
and
he
be
for
fight
to
the
last
drop
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lord
,
as
gallant
as
ever
flesh
shew
itself
,
be
for
fight
to
the
last
also
;
and
my
old
pilot
be
of
the
opinion
we
be
able
to
resist
them
all
,
in
the
situation
<EOS>
we
then
be
in
:
and
thus
we
spend
the
day
in
debate
of
what
we
should
do
;
but
towards
evening
,
we
find
that
the
number
of
our
enemy
still
increase
:
perhaps
,
as
they
be
abroad
in
several
party
for
prey
,
the
first
have
send
out
scout
to
call
for
help
,
and
to
acquaint
them
of
their
booty
;
and
we
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
by
the
morning
they
may
still
be
a
great
number
;
so
I
begin
to
inquire
of
those
people
we
have
bring
from
Tobolski
,
if
there
be
no
other
,
or
more
private
way
,
by
which
we
may
avoid
them
in
the
night
,
and
perhaps
either
retreat
to
some
town
,
or
get
help
to
guard
us
over
the
desert
.
  
<EOS>
the
Siberian
,
who
be
servant
to
the
young
lord
,
tell
us
,
if
we
design
to
avoid
them
,
and
not
fight
,
he
would
engage
to
carry
us
off
in
the
night
to
a
way
that
go
north
towards
the
river
Petraz
,
by
which
he
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
we
may
get
away
,
and
the
tartar
never
the
wise
;
but
he
say
,
his
lord
have
tell
him
he
would
not
return
,
but
would
rather
choose
to
fight
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
he
mistake
his
lord
;
for
that
he
be
too
wise
a
man
to
love
fighting
for
the
sake
of
it
<EOS>
;
that
I
know
his
lord
be
brave
enough
by
what
he
have
shew
already
;
but
that
his
lord
know
better
than
to
desire
to
have
seventeen
or
eighteen
man
fight
five
hundred
,
unless
an
unavoidable
necessity
force
them
to
it
;
and
that
if
he
think
it
possible
for
us
to
escape
in
the
night
,
we
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
if
his
lord
give
him
such
order
,
he
would
lose
his
life
if
he
do
not
perform
it
.
<EOS>
We
soon
bring
his
lord
to
give
that
order
,
though
privately
,
and
we
immediately
prepare
for
the
put
it
in
practice
.
  
<EOS>
and
first
,
as
soon
as
it
begin
to
be
dark
,
we
kindle
a
fire
in
our
little
camp
,
which
we
keep
burn
,
and
prepare
so
as
to
make
it
burn
all
night
,
that
the
Tartars
may
conclude
we
be
still
there
;
but
,
as
soon
as
it
be
dark
,
that
be
to
say
,
so
as
we
could
see
the
star
,
(
for
our
guide
would
not
stir
before
)
have
all
our
horse
and
camel
ready
load
,
we
follow
our
new
guide
,
who
,
I
soon
find
,
steer
himself
by
the
pole
or
north
star
,
all
the
country
be
level
for
a
long
way
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
travel
two
hour
very
hard
,
it
begin
to
be
light
still
;
not
that
it
be
quite
dark
all
night
,
but
the
moon
;
begin
to
rise
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
it
be
rather
light
than
we
wish
it
to
be
;
but
by
six
o'clock
next
morning
we
be
get
near
forty
mile
,
though
the
truth
be
,
we
almost
spoil
our
horse
.
<EOS>
here
we
find
a
russian
village
,
name
Kirmazinskoy
,
where
we
rest
,
and
hear
,
nothing
of
the
Kalmuck
Tartars
that
day
.
<EOS>
about
two
hour
before
night
we
set
out
again
,
and
travel
till
eight
the
next
morning
,
though
not
quite
so
hastily
as
before
;
and
about
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
we
pass
a
little
river
,
call
Kirtza
,
and
come
to
a
good
large
town
inhabit
by
Russians
,
and
very
populous
,
call
Ozomya
.
<EOS>
there
we
hear
,
that
several
troop
or
herd
of
Kalmucks
have
be
abroad
upon
the
desert
,
but
that
we
be
now
completely
out
of
danger
of
them
,
which
be
to
our
great
satisfaction
,
you
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
oblige
to
get
some
fresh
horse
,
and
have
need
enough
of
rest
,
we
staid
five
day
;
and
my
partner
<EOS>
and
I
agree
to
give
the
honest
Siberian
,
who
bring
us
hither
,
the
value
of
ten
pistole
for
his
conduct
us
.
  
<EOS>
in
five
day
more
we
come
to
Veussima
,
upon
the
river
Witzogda
,
which
run
into
the
river
Dwina
,
we
be
there
very
happily
near
the
end
of
our
travel
by
land
,
that
river
be
navigable
in
seven
day
passage
to
Archangel
.
<EOS>
from
hence
we
come
to
Lawrenskoy
,
where
the
river
join
,
the
third
of
July
;
and
provide
ourselves
with
two
luggage
-
boat
,
and
a
barge
,
for
our
convenience
.
<EOS>
We
embark
the
seventh
,
and
arrive
all
safe
at
Archangel
the
eighteenth
,
have
be
a
year
,
five
month
,
and
three
day
on
the
journey
,
include
our
stay
of
eight
month
and
odd
day
at
Tobolski
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
oblige
to
stay
at
this
place
six
week
for
the
arrival
of
the
ship
,
and
must
have
tarry
longer
,
have
not
a
Hamburgher
come
in
above
a
month
sooner
than
any
of
the
english
ship
;
when
after
some
consideration
,
that
the
city
of
Hamburgh
may
happen
to
be
as
good
a
market
for
our
good
as
London
,
we
all
take
freight
with
him
;
and
have
put
our
good
on
board
,
it
be
most
natural
for
me
to
put
my
steward
,
on
board
to
take
care
of
them
;
by
which
mean
my
young
lord
have
a
sufficient
opportunity
to
conceal
himself
,
never
come
on
shore
again
in
all
the
time
we
staid
there
;
and
this
he
do
,
that
he
may
not
be
see
in
the
city
,
where
some
of
the
Moscow
merchant
would
certainly
have
see
and
discover
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
sail
from
Archangel
the
twentieth
of
August
the
same
year
;
and
,
after
no
extraordinary
bad
voyage
,
arrive
in
the
Elbe
the
thirteenth
of
September
.
<EOS>
here
my
partner
and
I
find
a
very
good
sale
for
our
good
,
as
well
those
of
China
,
as
the
sable
,
&
c.
of
Siberia
;
and
divide
the
produce
of
our
effect
my
share
amount
to
3475l
.
<EOS>
17
.
<EOS>
3d
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
so
many
loss
we
have
sustain
,
and
charge
we
have
be
at
;
only
remember
that
I
have
include
,
in
this
,
about
600l
.
<EOS>
worth
of
diamond
,
which
I
have
purchase
at
Bengal
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
young
lord
take
his
leave
of
us
,
and
go
up
to
the
Elbe
,
in
order
to
go
to
the
court
of
Vienna
,
where
he
resolve
to
seek
protection
,
and
where
he
could
correspond
with
those
of
his
father
's
friend
who
be
leave
alive
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
part
without
all
the
testimony
he
could
give
of
gratitude
for
the
service
I
have
do
him
,
and
his
sense
of
my
kindness
to
the
prince
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
to
conclude
:
have
staid
near
four
mouth
in
Hamburgh
,
I
come
from
thence
over
land
to
the
Hague
,
where
I
embark
in
the
packet
,
and
arrive
in
London
the
tenth
of
January
1705
,
have
be
go
from
England
ten
year
and
nine
month
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
,
resolve
to
harass
myself
no
more
,
I
be
prepare
for
a
long
journey
than
all
these
,
have
live
seventy
-
two
year
a
life
of
infinite
variety
,
and
learn
sufficiently
to
know
the
value
of
retirement
,
and
the
blessing
of
end
our
day
in
peace
.
