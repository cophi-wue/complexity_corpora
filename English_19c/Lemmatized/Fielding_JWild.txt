BOOK
I
  
shew
<EOS>
the
wholesome
use
draw
from
record
<EOS>
the
achievement
of
those
<EOS>
WONDERFUL
production
of
NATURE
call
GREAT
MEN
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
necessary
that
all
great
and
surprising
event
,
the
design
of
which
be
lay
,
conduct
,
and
bring
to
perfection
by
the
utmost
force
of
human
invention
and
art
,
should
be
produce
by
great
and
eminent
man
,
so
the
life
of
such
may
be
justly
and
properly
style
the
quintessence
of
history
.
<EOS>
in
these
,
when
deliver
to
us
by
sensible
writer
,
we
be
not
only
most
agreeably
entertain
,
but
most
usefully
instruct
;
for
,
besides
the
attain
hence
a
consummate
knowledge
of
human
nature
in
general
;
of
its
secret
spring
,
various
winding
,
and
perplex
maze
;
we
have
here
before
our
eye
lively
example
of
whatever
be
amiable
or
detestable
,
worthy
of
admiration
or
abhorrence
,
and
be
consequently
teach
,
in
a
manner
infinitely
more
effectual
than
by
precept
,
what
we
be
eagerly
to
imitate
or
carefully
to
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
but
besides
the
two
obvious
advantage
of
surveying
,
as
it
be
in
a
picture
,
the
true
beauty
of
virtue
and
deformity
of
vice
,
we
may
moreover
learn
from
Plutarch
,
Nepos
,
Suetonius
,
and
other
biographer
,
this
useful
lesson
,
not
too
hastily
,
nor
in
the
gross
,
to
bestow
either
our
praise
or
censure
;
since
we
shall
often
find
such
a
mixture
of
good
and
evil
in
the
same
character
that
it
may
require
a
very
accurate
judgment
and
a
very
elaborate
inquiry
to
determine
on
which
side
the
balance
turn
,
for
though
we
sometimes
meet
with
an
aristide
or
a
Brutus
,
a
lysander
or
a
Nero
,
yet
far
the
great
number
be
of
the
mixt
kind
,
neither
totally
good
nor
bad
;
their
great
virtue
be
obscure
and
allay
by
their
vice
,
and
those
again
soften
and
colour
over
by
their
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
of
this
kind
be
the
illustrious
person
whose
history
we
now
undertake
;
to
whom
,
though
nature
have
give
the
great
and
most
shine
endowment
,
she
have
not
give
them
absolutely
pure
and
without
allay
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
much
of
the
admirable
in
his
character
,
as
much
perhaps
as
be
usually
to
be
find
in
a
hero
,
I
will
not
yet
venture
to
affirm
that
he
be
entirely
free
from
all
defect
,
or
that
the
sharp
eye
of
censure
could
not
spy
out
some
little
blemish
lurk
amongst
his
many
great
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
We
would
not
therefore
be
understand
to
affect
give
the
reader
a
perfect
or
consummate
pattern
of
human
excellence
,
but
rather
,
by
faithfully
record
some
little
imperfection
which
shadow
over
the
lustre
of
those
great
quality
which
we
shall
here
record
,
to
teach
the
lesson
we
have
above
mention
,
to
induce
our
reader
with
us
to
lament
the
frailty
of
human
nature
,
and
to
convince
him
that
no
mortal
,
after
a
thorough
scrutiny
,
can
be
a
proper
object
of
our
adoration
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
enter
on
this
great
work
we
must
endeavour
to
remove
some
error
of
opinion
which
mankind
have
,
by
the
disingenuity
of
writer
,
contract
:
for
these
,
from
their
fear
of
contradict
the
obsolete
and
absurd
doctrine
of
a
set
of
simple
fellow
,
call
,
in
derision
,
sage
or
philosopher
,
<EOS>
have
endeavour
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
confound
the
idea
of
greatness
and
goodness
;
whereas
no
two
thing
can
possibly
be
more
distinct
from
each
other
,
for
greatness
consist
in
bring
all
manner
of
mischief
on
mankind
,
and
goodness
in
remove
it
from
them
.
<EOS>
It
seem
therefore
very
unlikely
that
the
same
person
should
possess
them
both
;
and
yet
nothing
be
more
usual
with
writer
,
who
find
many
instance
of
greatness
in
their
favourite
hero
,
than
to
make
him
a
compliment
of
goodness
into
the
bargain
;
and
this
,
without
consider
that
by
such
mean
they
destroy
the
great
perfection
call
uniformity
of
character
.
<EOS>
in
the
history
of
Alexander
and
Caesar
we
be
frequently
,
and
indeed
impertinently
,
remind
of
their
benevolence
and
generosity
,
of
their
clemency
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
when
the
former
have
with
fire
and
sword
overrun
a
vast
empire
,
have
destroy
the
life
of
an
immense
number
of
innocent
wretch
,
have
scatter
ruin
and
desolation
like
a
whirlwind
,
we
be
tell
,
as
an
example
of
his
clemency
,
that
he
do
not
cut
the
throat
of
an
old
woman
,
and
ravish
her
daughter
,
but
be
content
with
only
undo
them
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
mighty
Caesar
,
with
wonderful
greatness
of
mind
,
have
destroy
the
liberty
of
his
country
,
and
with
all
the
mean
of
fraud
and
force
have
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
equal
,
have
corrupt
and
enslave
the
great
people
whom
the
sun
ever
see
,
we
be
remind
,
as
an
evidence
of
his
generosity
,
of
his
largesse
to
his
follower
and
tool
,
by
whose
mean
he
have
accomplish
his
purpose
,
and
by
whose
assistance
he
be
to
establish
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
who
doth
not
see
that
such
sneak
quality
as
these
be
rather
to
be
bewail
as
imperfection
than
admire
as
ornament
in
these
great
man
;
rather
obscure
their
glory
,
and
hold
them
back
in
their
race
to
greatness
,
indeed
unworthy
the
end
for
which
they
seem
to
have
come
into
the
world
,
viz
.
<EOS>
of
perpetrate
vast
and
mighty
mischief
?
  
<EOS>
We
hope
our
reader
will
have
reason
justly
to
acquit
us
of
any
such
confound
idea
in
the
follow
page
;
in
which
,
as
we
be
to
record
the
action
of
a
great
man
,
so
we
have
nowhere
mention
any
spark
of
goodness
which
have
discover
itself
either
faintly
in
him
,
or
more
glaringly
in
any
other
person
,
but
as
a
meanness
and
imperfection
,
disqualify
them
for
undertaking
which
lead
to
honour
and
esteem
among
man
.
  
<EOS>
as
our
hero
have
as
little
as
perhaps
be
to
be
find
of
that
meanness
,
indeed
only
enough
to
make
him
partak
of
the
imperfection
of
humanity
,
instead
of
the
perfection
of
diabolism
,
we
have
venture
to
call
him
the
great
;
nor
do
we
doubt
but
our
reader
,
when
he
hath
peruse
his
story
,
will
concur
with
us
in
allow
him
that
title
.
   
<EOS>
give
an
account
of
as
many
of
our
HERO
's
ancestors
as
CAN
be
gather
out
of
the
rubbish
of
ANTIQUITY
,
<EOS>
which
HATH
BEEN
carefully
sift
for
that
PURPOSE
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
of
all
biographer
,
at
their
entrance
into
their
work
,
to
step
a
little
backwards
(
as
far
,
indeed
,
generally
as
they
be
able
)
and
to
trace
up
their
hero
,
as
the
ancient
do
the
river
Nile
,
till
an
incapacity
of
proceed
high
put
an
end
to
their
search
.
  
<EOS>
what
first
give
rise
to
this
method
be
somewhat
difficult
to
determine
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
think
that
the
hero
's
ancestor
have
be
introduce
as
foil
to
himself
.
<EOS>
again
,
I
have
imagine
it
may
be
to
obviate
a
suspicion
that
such
extraordinary
personage
be
not
produce
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
and
may
have
proceed
from
the
author
's
fear
that
,
if
we
be
not
tell
who
their
father
be
,
they
may
be
in
danger
,
like
prince
Prettyman
,
of
be
suppose
to
have
have
none
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
and
perhaps
more
truly
,
I
have
conjecture
that
the
design
of
the
biographer
hath
be
no
more
than
to
shew
his
great
learning
and
knowledge
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
a
design
to
which
the
world
hath
probably
owe
many
notable
discovery
,
and
indeed
most
of
the
labour
of
our
antiquarian
.
  
<EOS>
but
whatever
original
this
custom
have
,
it
be
now
too
well
establish
to
be
dispute
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
conform
to
it
in
the
strict
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Jonathan

then
(

the

by
his

excellence
in
an
art
of

without

with

and
dexterity

draw
forth
a

from

It
be
observable
that
Nature
seldom
produce
any
one
who
be
afterwards
to
act
a
notable
part
on
the
stage
of
life
,
but
she
give
some
warning
of
her
intention
;
and
,
as
the
dramatic
poet
generally
prepare
the
entry
of
every
considerable
character
with
a
solemn
narrative
,
or
at
least
a
great
flourish
of
drum
and
trumpet
,
so
doth
this
our
Alma
Mater
by
some
shrewd
hint
pre
-
admonish
us
of
her
intention
,
give
us
warn

as
it

and
cry

<EOS>
thus
Astyages
,
who
be
the
grandfather
of
Cyrus

dreamt
that
his
daughter
be
bring
to
bed
of
a
vine
,
whose
branch
overspread
all
Asia
;
and
<EOS>
Hecuba
,
while
big
with
Paris
,
dreamt
that
she
be
deliver
of
a
firebrand
that
set
all
Troy
in
flame
<EOS>
;
so
do
the
mother
of
our
great
man
,
while
she
be
with
child
of
him
,
dream
that
she
be
enjoy
in
the
night
by
the
god
Mercury
and
Priapus
.
<EOS>
this
dream
puzzle
all
the
learn
astrologer
of
her
time
,
seem
to
imply
in
it
a
contradiction
;
Mercury
be
the
god
of
ingenuity
,
and
Priapus
<EOS>
the
terror
of
those
who
practise
it
.
<EOS>
what
make
this
dream
the
more
wonderful
,
and
perhaps
the
true
cause
of
its
be
remember
,
be
a
very
extraordinary
circumstance
,
sufficiently
denote
something
preternatural
in
it
;
for
though
she
have
never
hear
even
the
name
of
either
of
these
god
,
she
repeat
these
very
word
in
the
morning
,
with
only
a
small
mistake
of
the
quantity
of
the
latter
,
which
she
choose
to
call
Priapus
instead
of
Priapus
;
and
her
husband
swear
that
,
though
he
may
possibly
have
name
Mercury
to
her
(
for
he
have
hear
of
such
an
heathen
god
)
,
he
never
in
his
life
could
anywise
have
put
her
in
mind
of
that
other
deity
,
with
whom
he
have
no
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
another
remarkable
incident
be
,
that
during
her
whole
pregnancy
she
constantly
long
for
everything
she
see
;
nor
could
be
satisfied
with
her
wish
unless
she
enjoy
it
clandestinely
;
and
as
nature
,
by
true
and
accurate
observer
,
be
remark
to
give
us
no
appetite
without
furnish
us
with
the
mean
of
gratify
them
;
so
have
she
at
this
time
a
most
marvellous
glutinous
quality
attend
her
finger
,
to
which
,
as
to
birdlime
,
everything
closely
adhere
that
she
handle
.
  
<EOS>
to
omit
other
story
,
some
of
which
may
be
perhaps
the
growth
of
superstition
,
we
proceed
to
the
birth
of
our
hero
,
who
make
his
first
appearance
on
this
great
theatre
the
very
day
when
the
plague
first
break
out
in
1665
.
<EOS>
some
say
his
mother
be
deliver
of
him
in
an
house
of
an
orbicular
or
round
form
in
covent
-
garden
;
but
of
this
we
be
not
certain
.
<EOS>
He
be
some
year
afterwards
baptize
by
the
famous
Mr.
Titus
Oates
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
very
remarkable
pass
in
his
year
of
infancy
,
save
that
,
as
the
letter
TH
be
the
most
difficult
of
pronunciation
,
and
the
last
which
a
child
attain
to
the
utterance
of
,
so
they
be
the
first
that
come
with
any
readiness
from
young
master
Wild
.
<EOS>
nor
must
we
omit
the
early
indication
which
he
give
of
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
;
for
though
he
be
by
no
means
to
be
terrify
into
compliance
,
yet
may
he
,
by
a
sugar
-
plum
,
be
bring
to
your
purpose
;
indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
to
be
bribe
to
anything
,
which
make
many
say
he
be
certainly
bear
to
be
a
great
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
scarce
settle
at
school
before
he
give
mark
of
his
lofty
and
aspire
temper
;
and
be
regard
by
all
his
schoolfellow
with
that
deference
which
man
generally
pay
to
those
superior
genius
who
will
exact
it
of
them
.
<EOS>
if
an
orchard
be
to
be
rob
Wild
be
consult
,
and
,
though
he
be
himself
seldom
concerned
in
the
execution
of
the
design
,
yet
be
he
always
concerter
of
it
,
and
treasurer
of
the
booty
,
some
little
part
of
which
he
would
now
and
then
,
with
wonderful
generosity
,
bestow
on
those
who
take
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
generally
very
secret
on
these
occasion
;
but
if
any
offer
to
plunder
of
his
own
head
,
without
acquaint
master
Wild
,
and
make
a
deposit
of
the
booty
,
he
be
sure
to
have
an
information
against
him
lodge
with
the
schoolmaster
,
and
to
be
severely
punish
for
his
pain
.
  
<EOS>
He
discover
so
little
attention
to
school
-
learning
that
his
master
,
who
be
a
very
wise
and
worthy
man
,
soon
give
over
all
care
and
trouble
on
that
account
,
and
,
acquaint
his
parent
that
their
son
proceed
extremely
well
in
his
study
,
he
permit
his
pupil
to
follow
his
own
inclination
,
perceive
they
lead
him
to
noble
pursuit
than
the
science
,
which
be
generally
acknowledge
to
be
a
very
unprofitable
study
,
and
indeed
greatly
to
hinder
the
advancement
of
man
in
the
world
:
but
though
master
Wild
be
not
esteem
the
readiest
at
make
his
exercise
,
he
be
universally
allow
to
be
the
most
dexterous
at
steal
it
of
all
his
schoolfellow
,
be
never
detect
in
such
furtive
composition
,
nor
indeed
in
any
other
exercitation
of
his
great
talent
,
which
all
incline
the
same
way
,
but
once
,
when
he
have
lay
violent
hand
on
a
book
call
Gradus
ad
Parnassum
,
i.
e.
<EOS>
a
step
towards
Parnassus
,
on
which
account
his
master
,
who
be
a
man
of
most
wonderful
wit
and
sagacity
,
be
say
to
have
tell
him
he
wish
it
may
not
prove
in
the
event
Gradus
ad
Patibulum
,
i.
e.
<EOS>
a
step
towards
the
gallow
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
though
he
would
not
give
himself
the
pain
requisite
to
acquire
a
competent
sufficiency
in
the
learned
language
,
yet
do
he
readily
listen
with
attention
to
other
,
especially
when
they
translate
the
classical
author
to
him
;
nor
be
he
in
the
least
backward
,
at
all
such
time
,
to
express
his
approbation
.
<EOS>
He
be
wonderfully
pleased
with
that
passage
in
the
eleventh
Iliad
where
Achilles
be
say
to
have
bind
two
son
of
Priam
upon
a
mountain
,
and
afterwards
to
have
release
them
for
a
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
he
say
,
alone
sufficient
to
refute
those
who
affect
a
contempt
for
the
wisdom
of
the
ancient
,
and
an
undeniable
testimony
of
the
great
antiquity
of
priggism.[Footnote
:
<EOS>
this
word
,
in
the
can
not
language
,
signify
thievery

]
<EOS>
He
be
ravish
with
the
account
which
Nestor
give
in
the
same
book
of
the
rich
booty
which
he
bear
off
(
i.e.
stole
)
from
the
Eleans
.
<EOS>
He
be
desirous
of
have
this
often
repeat
to
him
,
and
at
the
end
of
every
repetition
he
constantly
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
say
it
be
a
GLORIOUS
BOOTY
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
story
of
Cacus
be
read
to
him
out
of
the
eighth
Aeneid
he
generously
pity
the
unhappy
fate
of
that
great
man
,
to
whom
he
think
hercule
much
too
severe
:
one
of
his
schoolfellow
commend
the
dexterity
of
draw
the
oxen
backward
by
their
tail
into
his
den
,
he
smile
,
and
with
some
disdain
say
,
he
COULD
have
teach
him
a
BETTER
WAY
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
passionate
admirer
of
hero
,
particularly
of
Alexander
the
Great
,
between
whom
and
the
late
king
of
Sweden
he
would
frequently
draw
parallel
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
delighted
with
the
account
of
the
Czar
's
retreat
from
the
latter
,
who
carry
off
the
inhabitant
of
great
city
to
people
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
this
,
he
say
,
be
not
once
thought
of
by
Alexander
;
but
add
,
perhaps
he
do
not
want
them
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
<EOS>
have
it
be
for
him
if
he
have
confine
himself
to
this
sphere
;
but
his
chief
,
if
not
only
blemish
,
be
,
that
he
would
sometimes
,
from
an
humility
in
his
nature
too
pernicious
to
true
greatness
,
condescend
to
an
intimacy
with
inferior
thing
and
person
.
<EOS>
thus
the
Spanish
Rogue
be
his
favourite
book
,
and
the
Cheats
of
Scapin
his
favourite
play
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman

now
at
the
age
of
seventeen

from
a
foolish
prejudice

out
of
a
false

bring
his

to
town

where
he

till

<EOS>
whilst

Mr.

lay
violent
hand
on

or
,
as
the
vulgar

arrest
one
count
La

,
a
man
of
considerable
figure
in
those
day
,
and
have
confine
him
to
his
own
house
till
he
could
find
two
second
who
would
in
a
formal
manner
<EOS>
give
their

that
the

should
,
at
a

place
appoint

answer
all
that
one
Thomas

a

Thomas
Thimble
,
it
seem

allege
that
the
count
have

accord
to
the

of

make
over
his
body
to
him
as
a

for
some
suit

deliver
by

<EOS>
now
as
the
count
,
though
perfectly
a

could
not
immediately
find
these
second
,
he
be
oblige
for
some
time
to
reside
at
Mr.
Snap
's
house
:
for
it
seem
the
law
of
the
land
be
,
that
whoever
owe
another
10
pound

or
indeed
2
pound

may

from

keep
abroad
till
he
be
make
to
owe

50
pound
,
whether
he
will
or
no

for
which
he
be
perhaps
afterwards
oblige
to
lie
in
gaol
;
and
all
these
without
any
trial
have
,
or
any
other
evidence
of
the

the

oath

which
if
untrue

as
it
often
happen
,
you
have
no
remedy
against
the
perjurer

he
be
,
forsooth
,
mistaken

<EOS>
but
though
Mr.
Snap
would
not
(
as
perhaps
by
the
nice
rule
of
honour
he
be
oblige

discharge
the

do
he
not

the

of
keep

take
his

's
word
that

<EOS>
Mr.

have
by
his
second
lady
two
daughter
,
who
be
now
in
the
bloom
of
their
youth
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
these
young
lady
,
like
damsel
in
romance
,
compassionate
the
captive
count
,
and
endeavour
by
all
mean
to
make
his
confinement
less
irksome
to
him
;
which
,
though
they
be
both
very
beautiful
,
they
could
not
attain
by
any
other
way
so
effectually
as
by
engage
with
him
at
card
,
in
which
contention
,
as
will
appear
hereafter

the

be
greatly
skilful

as

they

to
look
for

<EOS>
Mr.

himself
would
sometimes
relax
his
mind
from
the
violent
fatigue
of
his
employment
by
these
recreation
;
and
sometimes
a
neighbour
young
gentleman
or
lady
come
in
to
their
assistance
:
but
the
most
frequent

be
young
master

who

and

by
all

of
Miss

,
she
be
perhaps
,
in
the
eye
of
a
strict
conscience

somewhat
too
nearly
related
to
him
,
yet
the
old

both
side
,
though
sufficiently
scrupulous
in
nice
matter
,
agree
to
overlook
this
objection
.
  
<EOS>
man
of
great
genius
as
easily
discover
one
another
as
freemason
can
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
no
wonder
that
the
count
soon
conceive
an
inclination
to
an
intimacy
with
our
young
hero
,
whose
vast
ability
could
not
be
conceal
from
one
of
the
count

discernment

for
though
this
latter
be
so
expert
at
his
card
that
he
be
proverbially
say
to
play
the
whole
game
,
he
be
no
match
for
master
Wild

who
,
inexperience
as
he
be
,
notwithstanding
all
the
art
,
the
dexterity
,
and
often
the
fortune
of
his
adversary

never
fail
to
send
him
away
from
the
table
with
less
in
his
pocket
than
he
bring
to
it
,
<EOS>
for
indeed
Langfanger
himself
could
not
have
extract
a
purse
with
more
ingenuity
than
our
young
hero
.
  
<EOS>
His
hand
make
frequent
visit
to
the
count

pocket
before
the
latter
have
entertain
any
suspicion
of
him
,
impute
the
several
loss
he
sustain
rather
to
the
innocent
and
sprightly
frolick
of
Miss
Doshy
,
or
Theodosia
,
with
which
,
as
she
indulge
him
with
little
innocent
freedom
about
her
person
in
return
,
he
think
himself
oblige
to
be
content
;
but
one
night
,
when
Wild
imagine
the
count
asleep
,
he
make
so
unguarded
an
attack
upon
him
,
that
the
other
catch
him
in
the
fact
:
however
,
he
do
not
think
proper
to
acquaint
him
with
the
discovery
he
have
make
,
but
,
prevent
him
from
any
booty
at
that
time
,
he
only
take
care
for
the
future
to
button
his
pocket
,
and
to
pack
the
card
with
double
industry
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
be
this
detection
from
cause
any
quarrel
between
these
two
prigs,[footnote

<EOS>
that
in
reality
it
recommend

to
each
other

,
consider
a
trick
in
life
as
a
gamester
doth
a
trick
at
play

<EOS>
It
set
him
on
his
guard
,
but
he
admire
the
dexterity
of
him
who
play
it
.
<EOS>
these
,
therefore
,
and
many
other
such
instance
of
ingenuity

operate
so
violently
on
the

that
,
notwithstanding
the
disparity
which
age

have
set
between
them

he
resolve
to

acquaintance

<EOS>
this
soon
produce
a
perfect
intimacy

and
that
a

which
have
a
long

so
doth

found
upon
them

mutual

the
great

I
assure

I

likely
to
owe

it
an

I
hope
friendship

with
the
great
genius

what

when
I

my

such
talent

<EOS>
for
I
make
no

,
at
my
discharge
from

which
will
now
soon
happen

I
shall
be
able

with
those

,
as
they
be
capable

set
a
true

on
such

they

have
it

such

may
be
your

for
those

Mr.
Wild
answer
,
"
Sir
,
I
be
not
insensible
of
my
obligation
to
you
,
as
well
for
the
over
-
value
you
have
set
on
my
small
ability
,
as
for
the
kindness
you
express
in
offer
to
introduce
me
among
my
superior
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
my
father
hath
often
persuade
me
to
push
myself
into
the
company
of
my
better
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
have
an
aukward
pride
in
my
nature
,
which
be
better
pleased
with
be
at
the
head
of
the
low
class
than
at
the
bottom
of
the
high
.
<EOS>
permit
me
to
say
,
though
the
idea
may
be
somewhat
coarse
,
I
have
rather
stand
on
the
summit
of
a
dunghill
than
at
the
bottom
of
a
hill
in
Paradise
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
think
it
signify
little
into
what
rank
of
life
I
be
throw
,
provide
I
make
a
great
figure
therein
,
and
should
be
as
well
satisfied
with
exert
my
talent
well
at
the
head
of
a
small
party
or
gang
,
as
in
the
command
of
a
mighty
army
;
for
I
be
far
from
agree
with
you
,
that
great
part
be
often
lose
in
a
low
situation
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
convince
it
be
impossible
they
should
be
lose
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
persuade
myself
that
there
be
not
few
than
a
thousand
in
Alexander
's
troop
capable
of
perform
what
Alexander
himself
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
because
such
spirit
be
not
elect
or
destine
to
an
imperial
command
,
be
we
therefore
to
imagine
they
come
off
without
a
booty
?
<EOS>
or
that
they
content
themselves
with
the
share
in
common
with
their
comrade
?
<EOS>
surely
,
no
.
<EOS>
in
civil
life
,
doubtless
,
the
same
genius
,
the
same
endowment
,
have
often
compose
the
statesman
and
the
prig
,
for
so
we
call
what
the
vulgar
name
a
thief
.
<EOS>
the
same
part
,
the
same
action
,
often
promote
man
to
the
head
of
superior
society
,
which
raise
them
to
the
head
of
low
;
and
where
be
the
essential
difference
if
the
one
end
on
Tower
-
hill
and
the
other
at
Tyburn
?
<EOS>
Hath
the
block
any
preference
to
the
gallow
,
or
the
ax
to
the
halter
,
but
be
give
them
by
the
ill
-
guide
judgment
of
man
?
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
me
,
therefore
,
if
I
be
not
so
hastily
inflame
with
the
common
outside
of
thing
,
nor
join
the
general
opinion
in
prefer
one
state
to
another
.
<EOS>
a
guinea
be
as
valuable
in
a
leathern
as
in
an
embroidered
purse
;
and
a
cod
's
head
be
a
cod
's
head
still
,
whether
in
a
pewter
or
a
silver
dish
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
count
reply
as
follow
:
"
what
you
have
now
say
doth
not
lessen
my
idea
of
your
capacity
,
but
confirm
my
opinion
of
the
ill
effect
of
bad
and
low
company
.
<EOS>
Can
any
man
doubt
whether
it
be
well
to
be
a
great
statesman
or
a
common
thief
?
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
that
the
devil
use
to
say
,
where
or
to
whom
I
know
not
,
that
it
be
well
to
reign
in
Hell
than
to
be
a
valet
-
de
-
chambre
in
Heaven
,
and
perhaps
he
be
in
the
right
;
but
sure
,
if
he
have
have
the
choice
of
reign
in
either
,
he
would
have
choose
better
.
<EOS>
the
truth
therefore
be
,
that
by
low
conversation
we
contract
a
great
awe
for
high
thing
than
they
deserve
.
<EOS>
We
decline
great
pursuit
not
from
contempt
but
despair
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
prefer
the
high
road
to
a
more
reputable
way
of
make
his
fortune
doth
it
because
he
imagine
the
one
easy
than
the
other
;
but
you
yourself
have
assert
,
and
with
undoubted
truth
,
that
the
same
ability
qualify
you
for
undertaking
,
and
the
same
mean
will
bring
you
to
your
end
in
both
journey
 
as
in
music
it
be
the
same
tune
,
whether
you
play
it
in
a
high
or
a
low
key
.
<EOS>
to
instance
in
some
particular
:
be
it
not
the
same
qualification
which
enable
this
man
to
hire
himself
as
a
servant
,
and
to
get
into
the
confidence
and
secret
of
his
master
in
order
to
rob
him
,
and
that
to
undertake
trust
of
the
high
nature
with
a
design
to
break
and
betray
them
?
<EOS>
be
it
less
difficult
by
false
token
to
deceive
a
shopkeeper
into
the
delivery
of
his
good
,
which
you
afterwards
run
away
with
,
than
to
impose
upon
him
by
outward
splendour
and
the
appearance
of
fortune
into
a
credit
by
which
you
gain
and
he
lose
twenty
time
as
much
?
<EOS>
doth
<EOS>
it
not
require
more
dexterity
in
the
finger
to
draw
out
a
man
's
purse
from
his
pocket
,
or
to
take
a
lady
's
watch
from
her
side
,
without
be
perceive
of
any
(
an
excellence
in
which
,
without
flattery
,
I
be
persuade
you
have
no
superior
)
,
than
to
cog
a
die
or
to
shuffle
a
pack
of
card
?
<EOS>
be
not
as
much
art
,
as
many
excellent
quality
,
require
to
make
a
pimping
porter
at
a
common
bawdy
-
house
as
would
enable
a
man
to
prostitute
his
own
or
his
friend
's
wife
or
child
?
<EOS>
doth
it
not
ask
as
good
a
memory
,
as
nimble
an
invention
,
as
steady
a
countenance
,
to
forswear
yourself
in
Westminster
-
hall
as
would
furnish
out
a
complete
tool
of
state
,
or
perhaps
a
statesman
himself
?
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
particularize
every
instance
;
in
all
we
shall
find
that
there
be
a
near
connexion
between
high
and
low
life
than
be
generally
imagine
,
and
that
a
highwayman
be
entitle
to
more
favour
with
the
great
than
he
usually
meet
with
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
as
I
think
I
have
prove
,
the
same
part
which
qualify
a
man
for
eminence
in
a
low
sphere
,
qualify
him
likewise
for
eminence
in
a
high
,
sure
it
can
be
no
doubt
in
which
he
would
chuse
to
exert
them
.
<EOS>
ambition
,
without
which
no
one
can
be
a
great
man
,
will
immediately
instruct
him
,
in
your
own
phrase
,
to
prefer
a
hill
in
Paradise
to
a
dunghill
;
nay
,
even
fear
,
a
passion
the
most
repugnant
to
greatness
,
will
shew
him
how
much
more
safely
he
may
indulge
himself
in
the
free
and
full
exertion
of
his
mighty
ability
in
the
high
than
in
the
low
rank
;
since
experience
teach
him
that
there
be
a
crowd
oftener
in
one
year
at
Tyburn
than
on
Tower
-
hill
in
a
century
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
with
much
solemnity
rejoin

"
<EOS>
that

<EOS>
to
arrive
at
any
degree
of
eminence
in
his
profession
,
would
likewise
raise
a
man
in
what
the
world
esteem
a
more
honourable
calling
,
I
do
not
deny
;
nay
,
in
many
of
your
instance
it
be
evident
that
more
ingenuity
,
more
art
,
be
necessary
to
the
low
than
the
high
proficient
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
you
have
only
contend
that
every
prig
may
be
a
statesman
if
he
please
,
I
have
readily
agree
to
it
;
but
when
you
conclude
that
it
be
his
interest
to
be
so
,
that
ambition
would
bid
him
take
that
alternative
,
in
a
word
,
that
a
statesman
be
great
or
happy
than
a
prig
,
I
must
deny
my
assent
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
compare
these
two
together
,
we
must
carefully
avoid
be
mislead
by
the
vulgar
erroneous
estimation
of
thing
,
for
mankind
err
in
disquisition
of
this
nature
as
physician
do
who
in
consider
the
operation
of
a
disease
have
not
a
due
regard
to
the
age
and
complexion
of
the
patient
.
<EOS>
the
same
degree
of
heat
which
be
common
in
this
constitution
may
be
a
fever
in
that
;
in
the
same
manner
that
which
may
be
rich
or
honour
to
me
may
be
poverty
or
disgrace
to
another
:
for
all
these
thing
be
to
be
estimate
by
relation
to
the
person
who
possess
them
.
<EOS>
a
booty
of
L10
look
as
great
in
the
eye
of
a
bridle
-
cull
,
and
give
as
much
real
happiness
to
his
fancy
,
as
that
of
as
many
thousand
to
the
statesman
;
and
doth
not
the
former
lie
out
his
acquisition
in
whore
and
fiddle
with
much
great
joy
and
mirth
than
the
latter
in
palace
and
picture
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
flattery
,
the
false
compliment
of
his
gang
to
the
statesman
,
when
he
himself
must
condemn
his
own
blunder
,
and
be
oblige
against
his
will
to
give
fortune
the
whole
honour
of
success
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
pride
result
from
such
sham
applause
,
compare
to
the
secret
satisfaction
which
a
prig
enjoy
in
his
mind
in
reflect
on
a
well
-
contrived
and
well
-
execute
scheme
?
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
the
great
danger
be
on
the
prig
's
side
;
but
then
you
must
remember
that
the
great
honour
be
so
too
.
<EOS>
when
I
mention
honour
,
I
mean
that
which
be
pay
them
by
their

;
for
that
weak
part
of
the
world
which
be
vulgarly
call
the
WISE
see
both
in
a
disadvantageous
and
disgraceful
light
;
and
as
the
prig
enjoy
(
and
merit
too
)
<EOS>
the
great
degree
of
honour
from
his
gang
,
so
doth
<EOS>
he
suffer
the
less
disgrace
from
the
world
,
who
think
his
misdeed
,
as
they
call
them
,
sufficiently
at
last
punish
with
a
halter
,
which
at
once
put
an
end
to
his
pain
and
infamy
;
whereas
the
other
be
not
only
hate
in
power
,
but
detest
and
contemn
at
the
scaffold
;
and
future
age
vent
their
malice
on
his
fame
,
while
the
other
sleep
quiet
and
forgotten
.
<EOS>
besides
,
let
us
a
little
consider
the
secret
quiet
of
their
conscience
:
how
easy
be
the
reflection
of
have
take
a
few
shilling
or
pound
from
a
stranger
,
without
any
breach
of
confidence
,
or
perhaps
any
great
harm
to
the
person
who
lose
it
,
compare
to
that
of
have
betray
a
public
trust
,
and
ruin
the
fortune
of
thousand
,
perhaps
of
a
great
nation
!
<EOS>
how
much
brave
be
an
attack
on
the
highway
than
at
a
gaming
-
table
;
and
how
much
more
innocent
the
character
of
a
b####dy

house
than
a
c####t
pimp
!

"
<EOS>
He
be
eagerly

,
when
,
cast
his
eye
on
the

he
perceive
him
to
be
fast
asleep
;
wherefore
,
have
first
pick
his
pocket
of
three
shilling
,
<EOS>
then
gently
jog
him
in
order
to
take
his
leave
,
and
promise
to
return
to
him
the
next
morning
to
breakfast

they

<EOS>
the

retire

cellar

<EOS>
further
conference

the
COUNT

<EOS>
the
count
miss
his
money
the
next
morning
,
and
very
well
know
who
have
it
;
but
,
as
he
know
likewise
how
fruitless
would
be
any
complaint
,
he
choose
to
pass
it
by
without
mention
it

<EOS>
indeed
it
may
appear
strange
to
some
reader
that
these
gentleman
,
who
know
each
other
to
be
thief
,
should
never
once
give
the
least
hint
of
this
knowledge
in
all
their
discourse
together
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
should
have
the
word
honesty
,
honour
,
and
friendship
as
often
in
their
mouth
as
any
other
man

<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
may
appear
strange
to
some

but
those
who
have
live
long
in
city

such
place

will
perhaps
be
able
to
solve

<EOS>
when
our
two

meet
the
next
morning
the
count
(
who
,
though
he
do
not
agree
with
the
whole
of
his

doctrine

be
,
however
,
highly
pleased
with
his
argument

begin
to
bewail
the
misfortune
of
his
captivity
,
and
the
backwardness
of
friend
to
assist
each
other
in
their
necessity
;
but
what
vex
him
,
he
say
,
most
,
be
the
cruelty
of
the
fair
:
for
he
intrust
Wild
with
the
secret
of
his
have
have
an
intrigue
with
Miss
Theodosia
,
the
elder
of
the
Miss
Snaps
,
ever
since
his
confinement
,
though
he
could
not
prevail
with
her
to
set
him
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
Wild
answer
,
with
a
smile
,
"
It
be
no
wonder
a
woman
should
wish
to
confine
her
lover
where
she
may
be
sure
of
have
him
entirely
to
herself
;
"
but
add
,
he
believe
he
could
tell
him
a
method
of
certainly
procure
his
escape
.
<EOS>
the
count
eagerly
beseech
him
to
acquaint
him
with
it
.
<EOS>
Wild
tell
him
bribery
be
the
sure
mean
,
and
advise
him
to
apply
to
the
maid
.
<EOS>
the
count
thank
him
,
but
return
,
"
that
he
have
not
a
farthing
leave
besides
one
guinea
,
which
he
have
then
give
her
to
change

<EOS>
to
which
Wild
say
,
"
He
must
make
it
up
with
promise

he
suppose
he
be
courti
enough

"
<EOS>
the
count
greatly
applaud
the
advice
,
and
say
he
hope
he
should
be
able
in
time
to
persuade
him
to
condescend
to
be
a
great
man
,
for
which
he
be
so
perfectly
well
qualified
.
  
<EOS>
this
method
be
conclude
on
,
the
two
friend
sit
down
to
card
,
a
circumstance
which
I
should
not
have
mention
but
for
the
sake
of
observe
the
prodigious
force
of
habit
;
for
though
the
count
know
if
he
win
ever
so
much
of
Mr.
Wild
he
should
not
receive
a
shilling
,
yet
could
he
not
refrain
from
pack
the
card
;
nor
could
Wild
keep
his
hand
out
of
his
friend
's
pocket
,
though
he
know
there
be
nothing
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
maid
come
home
the
count
begin
to
put
it
to
her
;
offer
her
all
he
have
,
and
promise
mountain
in
futuro
;
but
all
in
vain
 
<EOS>
the
maid
's
honesty
be
impregnable
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
She
would
not
break
her
trust
for
the
whole
world
;
no
,
not
if
she
could
gain
a
hundred
pound
by
it
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
Wild
step
up
and
tell
her
"
She
nee
not
fear
lose
her
place
,
for
it
would
never
be
find
out
;
that
they
could
throw
a
pair
of
sheet
into
the
street
,
by
which
it
may
appear
he
get
out
at
a
window
;
that
he
himself
would
swear
he
see
him
descend
;
that
the
money
would
be
so
much
gain
in
her
pocket
;
that
,
besides
his
promise
,
which
she
may
depend
on
be
perform
,
she
would
receive
from
him
twenty
shilling
and
ninepence
in
ready
money
(
for
she
have
only
lay
out
threepence
in
plain
spanish
)
;
and
lastly
,
that
,
besides
his
honour
,
the
count
should
leave
a
pair
of
gold
button
(
which
afterwards
turn
out
to
be
brass
)
of
great
value
,
in
her
hand
,
as
a
further
pawn
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
maid
still
remain
inflexible
,
till
Wild
offer
to
lend
his
friend
a
guinea
more
,
and
to
deposit
it
immediately
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
this
reinforcement
bear
down
the
poor
girl
's
resolution
,
and
she
faithfully
promise
to
open
the
door
to
the
count
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
thus
do
our
young
hero
not
only
lend
his
rhetoric
,
which
few
people
care
to
do
without
a
fee
,
but
his
money
too
(
a
sum
which
many
a
good
man
would
have
make
fifty
excuse
before
he
would
have
part
with
)
,
to
his
friend
,
and
procure
him
his
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
highly
derogatory
from
the
great
character
of
Wild
,
<EOS>
should
the
reader
imagine
he
lend
such
a
sum
to
a
friend
without
the
least
view
of
serve
himself
.
<EOS>
as
,
therefore
,
the
reader
may
easily
account
for
it
in
a
manner
more
advantageous
to
our
hero
's
reputation
,
by
conclude
that
he
have
some
interested
view
in
the
count
's
enlargement
,
we
hope
he
will
judge
with
charity
,
especially
as
the
sequel
make
it
not
only
reasonable
but
necessary
to
suppose
he
have
some
such
view
.
  
<EOS>
a
long
intimacy
and
friendship
subsist
between
the
count
and
Mr.
Wild
,
who
,
be
by
the
advice
of
the
count
dress
in
good
cloath

introduce
into
the
good
company

They
constantly
frequent
the
assembly

auction
,
gaming

and
play

at
which
last
they
see
two
act
every
night
,
and
then
retire
without
pay
 
this
being
,
it
seem
,
an
immemorial
privilege
which
the
beaus
of
the
town
prescribe
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
do
not
suit
Wild
's
temper
,
who
call
it
a
cheat
,
and
object
against
it
as
require
no
dexterity

but
what
every
blockhead
may
put
in
execution

He
say
it
be
a
custom
very
much
savouring
of
the
sneaking

budge

[

but
neither
so
honourable

so
ingenious

make

too
insipid

inactive

MASTER
WILD
set
out
on
his
travel
,
and
RETURNS
HOME
again
.
<EOS>
a
very
short
chapter
,
contain
infinitely
MORE
time
and
LESS
MATTER
<EOS>
than
any
other
in
the
WHOLE
STORY
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
sorry
we
can
not
indulge
our
reader
's
curiosity
with
a
full
and
perfect
account
of
this
accident
;
but
as
there
be
such
various
account
,
one
of
which
only
can
be
true
,
and
possibly
and
indeed
probably
none
;
instead
of
follow
the
general
method
of
historians
,
who
in
such
case
set
down
the
various
report
,
and
leave
to
your
own
conjecture
which
you
will
chuse
,
we
shall
pass
them
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
,
whatever
this
accident
be
,
it
determine
our
hero
's
father
to
send
his
son
immediately
abroad
for
seven
year
;
and
,
which
may
seem
somewhat
remarkable
,
to
his
majesty
's
plantation
in
America
 
that
part
of
the
world
be
,
as
he
say
,
free
from
vice
than
the
court
and
city
of
Europe
,
and
consequently
less
dangerous
to
corrupt
a
young
man
's
moral
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
advantage
,
the
old
gentleman
think
they
be
equal
there
with
those
attain
in
the
politer
climate
;
for
travelling
,
he
say
,
be
travel
in
one
part
of
the
world
as
well
as
another
;
it
consist
in
be
such
a
time
from
home
,
and
in
traverse
so
many
league
;
and
[
he
]
appeal
to
experience
whether
most
of
our
traveller
in
France
and
Italy
do
not
prove
at
their
return
that
they
may
have
be
send
as
profitably
to
Norway
and
Greenland
.
  
<EOS>
accord
to
these
resolution
of
his
father
,
the
young
gentleman
go
aboard
a
ship
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
good
company
set
out
for
the
american
hemisphere
.
<EOS>
the
exact
time
of
his
stay
be
somewhat
uncertain
;
most
probably
longer
than
be
intend
.
<EOS>
but
howsoever
long
his
abode
<EOS>
there
be
,
it
must
be
a
blank
in
this
history
,
as
the
whole
story
contain
not
one
adventure
worthy
the
reader
's
notice
;
be
indeed
a
continued
scene
of
whore
,
drinking
,
and
remove
from
one
place
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
to
confess
a
truth
,
we
be
so
ashamed
of
the
shortness
of
this
chapter
,
that
we
would
have
do
a
violence
to
our
history
,
and
have
insert
an
adventure
or
two
of
some
other
traveller
;
to
which
purpose
we
borrow
the
journal
of
several
young
gentleman
who
have
lately
make
the
tour
of
Europe
;
but
to
our
great
sorrow
,
could
not
extract
a
single
incident
strong
enough
to
justify
the
theft
to
our
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
consider
the
ridiculous
figure
this
chapter
must
make
,
be
the
history
of
no
less
than
eight
year
,
our
only
comfort
be
,
that
the
history
of
some
man
's
life
,
and
perhaps
of
some
man
who
have
make
a
noise
in
the
world
,
be
in
reality
as
absolute
blank
as
the
travel
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
as
,
therefore
,
we
shall
make
sufficient
amend
in
the
sequel
for
this
inanity
,
we
shall
hasten
on
to
matter
of
true
importance
and
immense
greatness
.
<EOS>
at
present
we
content
ourselves
with
set
down
our
hero
where
we
take
him
up
,
after
acquaint
our
reader
that
he
go
abroad
,
staid
seven
year
,
and
then
come
home
again
.
   
<EOS>
an
adventure
<EOS>
where
WILD
,
in
the
division
of
the
BOOTY
,
exhibit
an
astonishing
instance
of
GREATNESS
.
 
<EOS>
the
count
be
one
night
very
successful
at
the
hazard
-
table
,
where
Wild
,
who
be
just
return
from
his
travel
,
be
then
present
;
as
be
likewise
a
young
gentleman
whose
name
be
Bob
Bagshot
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mr.
Wild
's
,
and
of
whom
he
entertain
a
great
opinion
;
taking
,
therefore
,
Mr.
Bagshot
aside
,
he
advise
him
to
provide
himself
(
if
he
have
them
not
about
him
)
with
a
case
of
pistol
,
and
to
attack
the
count
in
his
way
home
,
promise
to
plant
himself
near
with
the
same
arm
,
as
a
corps
de
reserve
,
and
to
come
up
on
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
be
accordingly
execute
,
and
the
count
oblige
to
surrender
to
savage
force
what
he
have
in
<EOS>
so
genteel
and
civil
a
manner
take
at
play
.
  
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
a
wise
and
philosophical
observation
,
that
one
misfortune
never
come
alone
,
the
count
have
hardly
pass
the
examination
of
Mr.
Bagshot
when
he
fall
into
the
hand
of
Mr.
Snap
,
who
,
in
company
with
Mr.
Wild
the
elder
and
one
or
two
more
gentleman
,
be
,
it
seem
,
thereto
well
warrant
,
lay
hold
of
the
unfortunate
count
,
and
convey
him
back
to
the
same
house
from
which
,
by
the
assistance
of
his
good
friend
,
he
have
formerly
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
and
Mr.
Bagshot
go
together
to
the
tavern
,
where
Mr.
Bagshot
(
generously
,
as
he
think
)
offer
to
share
the
booty
,
and
,
have
divide
the
money
into
two
unequal
heap
,
and
add
a
golden
snuff
-
box
to
the
less
heap
,
he
desire
Mr.
Wild
to
take
his
choice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
immediately
convey
the
large
share
of
the
ready
into
his
pocket
,
accord
to
an
excellent
maxim
of
his
,
"
first
secure
what
share
you
can
before
you
wrangle
for
the
rest
;
"
and
then
,
turn
to
his
companion
,
he
ask
with
a
stern
countenance
whether
he
intend
to
keep
all
that
sum
to
himself
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Bagshot
answer
,
with
some
surprize
,
that
he
think
Mr.
Wild
have
no
reason
to
complain
;
for
it
be
surely
fair
,
at
least
on
his
part
,
to
content
himself
with
an
equal
share
of
the
booty
,
who
have
take
the
whole
.
<EOS>
"
I
grant
you
take
it
,
"
reply
Wild
;
"
but
,
pray
,
who
propose
or
counsel
the
taking
it
?
<EOS>
Can
you
say
that
you
have
do
more
than
execute
my
scheme
?
<EOS>
and
may
not
I
,
if
I
have
please
,
have
employ
another
,
since
you
well
know
there
be
not
a
gentleman
in
the
room
but
would
have
take
the
money
if
he
have
know
how
,
conveniently
and
safely
,
to
do
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true
,
"
return
Bagshot
,
"
but
do
not
I
execute
the
scheme
,
<EOS>
do
not
I
run
the
whole
risque
?
<EOS>
Should
not
I
have
suffer
the
whole
punishment
if
I
have
be
take
,
and
be
not
the
labour
worthy
of
his
hire
?
"
<EOS>
"
doubtless
,
"
say
Jonathan
,
"
he
be
so
,
and
your
hire
<EOS>
I
shall
not
refuse
you
,
which
be
all
that
the
labourer
be
entitle
to
or
ever
enjoy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
when
I
be
at
school
to
have
hear
some
verse
which
for
the
excellence
of
their
doctrine
make
an
impression
on
me
,
purport
that
the
bird
of
the
air
and
the
beast
of
the
field
work
not
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
the
farmer
allow
fodder
to
his
oxen
and
pasture
to
his
sheep
;
but
it
be
for
his
own
service
,
not
theirs
,
in
the
same
manner
the
ploughman
,
the
shepherd
,
the
weaver
,
the
builder
,
and
the
soldier
,
work
not
for
themselves
but
other
;
they
be
content
with
a
poor
pittance
(
the
labourer
's
hire
)
,
and
permit
us
,
the
GREAT
,
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
labour
.
<EOS>
Aristotle
,
as
my
master
tell
us
,
hath
plainly
prove
,
in
the
first
book
of
his
politic
,
that
the
low
,
mean
,
useful
part
of
mankind
,
be
bear
slave
to
the
will
of
their
superior
,
and
be
indeed
as
much
their
property
as
the
cattle
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
say
of
us
,
the
high
order
of
mortal
,
that
we
be
bear
only
to
devour
the
fruit
of
the
earth
;
and
it
may
be
as
well
say
of
the
low
class
,
that
they
be
bear
only
to
produce
them
for
us
.
<EOS>
be
not
the
battle
gain
by
the
sweat
and
danger
of
the
common
soldier
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
honour
and
fruit
of
the
victory
the
general
's
who
lay
the
scheme
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
house
build
by
the
labour
of
the
carpenter
and
the
bricklayer
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
build
for
the
profit
only
of
the
architect
and
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitant
,
who
could
not
easily
have
place
one
brick
upon
another
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
cloth
or
the
silk
<EOS>
work
into
its
form
and
variegate
with
all
the
beauty
of
colour
by
those
who
be
force
to
content
themselves
with
the
coarse
and
vile
part
of
their
work
,
while
the
profit
and
enjoyment
of
their
labours
fall
to
the
share
of
other
?
<EOS>
cast
your
eye
abroad
,
and
see
who
be
it
live
in
the
most
magnificent
building
,
feast
his
palate
with
the
most
luxurious
dainty
,
his
eye
with
the
most
beautiful
sculpture
and
delicate
painting
,
and
clothe
himself
in
the
fine
and
rich
apparel
;
and
tell
me
if
all
these
do
not
fall
to
his
lot
who
have
not
any
the
least
share
in
produce
all
these
convenience
,
nor
the

ability
so
to
do

<EOS>
why
then
should
the
state
of
a
prig[footnote

<EOS>
differ
from
all
other

<EOS>
or
why
should
you

who
be
the

the
executor

expect
a

in
the
profit

<EOS>
be
advise
,
therefore
;
deliver
the
whole
booty
to
me
,
and
trust
to
my
bounty
for
your
reward

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bagshot
be
some
time
silent
,
and
look
like
a
man
thunderstruck
,
but
at
last
,
recover
himself
from
his
surprize
,
he
thus
begin
:
"
if
you
think
,
Mr.
Wild
,
by
the
force
of
your
argument

to
get
the
money
out
of

you

greatly
mistaken

D####n

if
you
take
me
for

I
must
tell
you
you
be
a
rascal

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
lay
his
hand
to
his
pistol
.
<EOS>
Wild
,
perceive
the
little
success
the
great
strength
of
his
argument
have
meet
with
,
and
the
hasty
temper
of
his
friend
,
give
over
his
design
for
the
present
,
and
tell
Bagshot
he
be
only
in
jest

but
this
coolness
with
which
he
treat
the
other

flame
have
rather
the
effect
of
oil
than
of
water
.
<EOS>
Bagshot
reply
in
a
rage
,
"
D####n
me
,
I
do
not
like
such
jest

I
see
you

pitiful
rascal

a
scoundrel

with
a
philosophy
worthy

return

as
for
your

have
no

lay
the

booty
on

out
his

dazzle
the

entirely
alter

he
say
,
"
no

<EOS>
he
be
content
with
what
he
have
already
;
that
it
be
mighty
ridiculous
in
them
to
quarrel
among
themselves

that
they
have
common
enemy
enough
abroad

now
to

a
little
insight
into

Wild

shake
his

tell

lovely
young
CREATURE

the
SUCCESSLESS

<EOS>
the
next
morning
when
our
hero
wake
he
begin
to
think
of
pay
a
visit
to
Miss
Tishy
Snap
,
a
woman
of
great
merit
and
of

Mr.
Wild
find
a

box
,
with
which
he
wait
upon
his
mistress
,
whom
he
find
in
the
most
beautiful
undress
.
<EOS>
Her
lovely
hair
hang
wantonly
over
her
forehead
,
be
neither
white
with
,
nor
yet
free
from
,
powder
;
a
neat
double
clout
,
which
seem
to
have
be
wear
a
few
week
only
,
be
pin

her
chin

some

of
that
art
with
which
lady
improve

her

her
body

without

so
that
her
breast

uncontrolle
liberty
to
display
their
beauteous
orb
,
which
they
do
as
low
as
her
girdle
;
a
thin
covering
of
a
rumpled
muslin
handkerchief
almost
hide
them
from
the
eye
,
save
in
a
few
part
,
where
a
good
-
natured
hole
give
opportunity
to
the
naked
breast
to
appear
.
<EOS>
Her
gown
be
a
satin
of
a
whitish
colour
,
with
about
a
dozen
little
silver
spot
upon
it
,
so
artificially
interweave
at
great
distance
,
that
they
look
as
if
they
have
fall

by
chance

<EOS>
this

fly

discover
a
fine
yellow

,
beautifully
edge
round
the
bottom
with
a
narrow
piece
of
half
gold
lace
which
be
now
almost
become
fringe
:
beneath
this
appear
another
petticoat
stiffen
with
whalebone
,
vulgarly
call
a
hoop
,
which
hang
six
inch
at
least
below
the
other
;
and
under
this
again
appear
an
under
-
garment
of
that
colour
which
Ovid
intend
when
he
say
,
    
Q
ui

<EOS>
She
likewise
display
two
pretty
foot
cover
with
silk
and
adorn
with
lace
,
and
tie
,
the
right
with
a
handsome
piece
of
blue
ribbon
;
the
left
,
as
more
unworthy
,
with
a
piece
of
yellow
stuff
,
which
seem
to
have
be
a
strip
of
her
upper
petticoat
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
lovely
creature
whom
Mr.
Wild
attend
.
<EOS>
She
receive
him
at
first
with
some
of
that
coldness
which
woman
of
strict
virtue
,
by
a
commendable
though
sometimes
painful
restraint
,
enjoin
themselves
to
their
lover
.
<EOS>
the
snuff
-
box
,
be
produce
,
be
at
first
civilly
,
and
indeed
gently
,
refuse
;
but
on
a
second
application
accept
.
<EOS>
the
tea
-
table
be
soon
call
for
,
at
which
a
discourse
pass
between
these
young
lover
,
which
,
could
we
set
it
down
with
any
accuracy
,
would
be
very
edifying
as
well
as
entertain
to
our
reader
;
let
it
suffice
then
that
the
wit
,
together
with
,
the
beauty
,
of
this
young
creature
,
so
inflame
the
passion
of
Wild
,
which
,
though
an
honourable
sort
of
a
passion
,
be
at
the
same
time
so
extremely
violent
,
that
it
transport
him
to
freedom
too
offensive
to
the
nice
chastity
of
Laetitia
,
who
be
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
more
indebted
to
her
own
strength
for
the
preservation
of
her
virtue
than
to
the
awful
respect
or
backwardness
of
her
lover
;
he
be
indeed
so
very
urgent
in
his
address
,
<EOS>
that
,
have
he
not
with
many
oath
promise
her
marriage
,
we
could
scarce
have
be
strictly
justify
in
call
his
passion
honourable
;
but
he
be
so
remarkably
attach
to
decency
,
that
he
never
offer
any
violence
to
a
young
lady
without
the
most
earnest
promise
of
that
kind
,
these
be
,
he
say
,
a
ceremonial
due
to
female
modesty
,
which
cost
so
little
,
and
be
so
easily
pronounce
,
that
the
omission
could
arise
from
nothing
but
the
mere
wantonness
of
brutality
.
<EOS>
the
lovely
Laetitia
,
either
out
of
prudence
,
or
perhaps
religion
,
of
which
she
be
a
liberal
professor
,
be
deaf
to
all
his
promise
,
and
luckily
invincible
by
his
force
;
for
,
though
she
have
not
yet
learn
the
art
of
well
clench
her
fist
,
nature
have
not
however
leave
her
defenceless
,
for
at
the
end
of
her
finger
she
wear
arm
,
which
she
use
with
such
admirable
dexterity
,
that
the
hot
blood
of
Mr.
Wild
soon
begin
to
appear
in
several
little
spot
on
his
face
,
and
his
full
-
blow
cheek
to
resemble
that
part
which
modesty
forbid
a
boy
to
turn
up
anywhere
<EOS>
but
in
a
public
school
,
after
some
pedagogue
,
strong
of
arm
,
hath
exercise
his
talent
thereon
.
<EOS>
Wild
now
retreat
from
the
conflict
,
and
the
victorious
Laetitia
,
with
become
triumph
and
noble
spirit
,
cry
out
,
"

I
will

I

"
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
talk
of
her
virtue
,
which
Wild
bid
her
carry
to
the
devil
with
her
,
and
thus

<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
be
no
sooner
depart
than
the
fair
conqueress
,
open
the
door
of
a
closet
,
call
forth
a
young
gentleman
whom
she
have
there
enclose
at
the
approach
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
this
gallant
be
Tom
Smirk
.
<EOS>
He
be
clerk
to
an
attorney
,
and
be
indeed
the
great
beau
and
the
great
favourite
of
the
lady
at
the
end
of
the
town
where
he
live
.
<EOS>
as
we
take
dress
to
be
the
characteristic
or
efficient
quality
of
a
beau
,
we
shall
,
instead
of
give
any
character
of
this
young
gentleman
,
content
ourselves
with
describe
his
dress
only
to
our
reader
.
<EOS>
He
wear
,
then
,
a
pair
of
white
stocking
on
his
leg
,
and
pump
on
his
foot
:
<EOS>
his
buckle
be
a
large
piece
of
pinchbeck
plate
,
which
almost
cover
his
whole
foot
.
<EOS>
His
breech
be
of
red
plush
,
which
hardly
reach
his
knee
;
his
waistcoat
be
a
white
dimity
,
richly
embroider
with
yellow
silk
,
over
which
he
wear
a
blue
plush
coat
with
metal
button
,
a
smart
sleeve
,
and
a
cape
reach
half
way
down
his
back
.
<EOS>
His
wig
be
of
a
brown
colour
,
cover
almost
half
his
pate
,
on
which
be
hang
on
one
side
a
little
laced
hat
,
but
cock
with
great
smartness
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
accomplished
Smirk
,
who
,
at
his
issuing
forth
from
the
closet
,
be
receive
with
open
arm
by
the
amiable
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
She
address
him
by
the
tender
name
of
dear
Tommy
,
and
tell
him
she
have
dismiss
the
odious
creature
whom
her
father
intend
for
her
husband
,
and
have
now
nothing
to
interrupt
her
happiness
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
reader
,
thou
must
pardon
us
if
we
stop
a
while
to
lament
the
capriciousness
of
Nature
in
form
this
charming
part
of
the
creation
design
to
complete
the
happiness
of
man
;
with
their
soft
innocence
to
allay
his
ferocity
,
with
their
sprightliness
to
soothe
his
care
,
and
with
their
constant
friendship
to
relieve
all
the
trouble
and
disappointment
which
can
happen
to
him
.
<EOS>
see
then
that
these
be
the
blessing
chiefly
seek
after
and
generally
find
in
every
wife
,
how
must
we
lament
that
disposition
in
these
lovely
creature
which
lead
them
to
prefer
in
their
favour
those
individual
of
the
other
sex
who
do
not
seem
intend
by
nature
as
so
great
<EOS>
a
masterpiece
!
<EOS>
for
surely
,
however
useful
they
may
be
in
the
creation
,
as
we
be
teach
that
nothing
,
not
even
a
louse
,
be
make
in
vain
,
yet
these
beau
,
even
that
most
splendid
and
honour
part
which
in
this
our
island
nature
love
to
distinguish
in
red
,
be
not
,
as
some
think
,
the
noble
work
of
the
Creator
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
let
any
man
chuse
to
himself
two
beau
,
let
them
be
captain
or
colonel
,
as
well
-
dress
man
as
ever
live
,
I
would
venture
to
oppose
a
single
Sir
Isaac
Newton
,
a
Shakespear
,
a
Milton
,
or
perhaps
some
few
other
,
to
both
these
beau
;
<EOS>
nay
,
and
I
very
much
doubt
whether
it
have
not
be
well
for
the
world
in
general
that
neither
of
these
beau
have
ever
be
bear
than
that
it
should
have
want
the
benefit
arise
to
it
from
the
labour
of
any
one
of
those
person
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
be
true
,
how
melancholy
must
be
the
consideration
that
any
single
beau
,
especially
if
he
have
but
half
a
yard
of
ribbon
in
his
hat
,
shall
weigh
heavier
in
the
scale
of
female
affection
than
twenty
Sir
Isaac
Newtons
!
<EOS>
how
must
our
reader
,
who
perhaps
have
wisely
account
for
the
resistance
which
the
chaste
Laetitia
have
make
to
the
violent
address
of
the
ravish
(
or
rather
ravish
)
wild
from
that
lady
's
impregnable
virtue
 
<EOS>
how
must
he
blush
,
I
say
,
to
perceive
her
<EOS>
quit
the
strictness
of
her
carriage
,
and
abandon
herself
to
those
loose
freedom
which
she
indulge
to
Smirk
!
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
when
we
discover
all
,
as
to
preserve
the
fidelity
of
our
history
we
must
,
when
we
relate
that
every
familiarity
have
past
between
them
,
and
that
the
FAIR
Laetitia
(
for
we
must
,
in
this
single
instance
,
imitate
Virgil
when
he
drop
the
pius
and
the
pater
,
and
drop
our
favourite
epithet
of
chaste
)
,
the
FAIR
Laetitia
have
,
I
say
,
make
Smirk
as
happy
as
Wild
desire
to
be
,
what
must
then
be
our
reader
's
confusion
!
<EOS>
We
will
,
therefore
,
draw
a
curtain
over
this
scene
,
from
that
philogyny
which
be
in
us
,
and
proceed
to
matter
which
,
instead
of
dishonour
the
human
specie
,
will
greatly
raise
and
ennoble
it
.
   
<EOS>
contain
<EOS>
as
<EOS>
notable
instance
of
HUMAN
GREATNESS
as
are
to
be
met
with
in
ANCIENT
or
modern
history
.
<EOS>
conclude
with
some
wholesome
hint
to
the
GAY
part
of
MANKIND
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
no
sooner
part
from
the
chaste
Laetitia
than
,
recollect
that
his
friend
the
count
be
return
to
his
lodging
in
the
same
house
,
he
resolve
to
visit
him
;
for
he
be
none
of
those
half
-
breed
fellow
who
be
ashamed
to
see
their
friend
when
they
have
plunder
and
betray
them
;
from
which
base
and
pitiful
temper
many
monstrous
cruelty
have
be
transact
by
man
,
who
have
sometimes
carry
their
modesty
so
far
as
to
the
murder
or
utter
ruin
of
those
against
whom
their
conscience
have
suggest
to
them
that
they
have
commit
some
small
trespass
,
either
by
the
debauching
a
friend
's
wife
or
daughter
,
belie
or
betray
the
friend
himself
,
or
some
other
such
trifling
instance
.
<EOS>
in
our
hero
there
be
nothing
not
truly
great
:
he
could
,
without
the
least
abashment
,
drink
a
bottle
with
the
man
who
know
he
have
the
moment
before
pick
his
pocket
;
and
,
when
he
have
strip
him
of
everything
he
have
,
never
desire
to
do
him
any
further
mischief
;
for
he
carry
good
-
nature
to
that
wonderful
and
uncommon
height
that
he
never
do
a
single
injury
to
man
or
woman
by
which
he
himself
do
not
expect
to
reap
some
advantage

<EOS>
He
would
often
indeed
say
that
by
the
contrary
party
man
often
make
a
bad
bargain
with
the
devil
,
and
do
his
work
for
nothing

<EOS>
Our
hero
find
the
captive
count
,
not
basely
lament
his
fate
nor
abandon
himself
to
despair
,
but
,
with
due
resignation
,
employ
himself
in
prepare
several
pack
of
card
for
future
exploit

<EOS>
the
count
,
little
suspecting
that
Wild
have
be
the
sole
contriver
of
the
misfortune
which
have
befall
him
,
rise
up
and
eagerly
embrace
him
,
and
Wild
return
his
embrace
with
equal
warmth
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
seated
than
Wild
take
an
occasion
,
from
see
the
card
lie
on
the
table
,
to
inveigh
against
gaming
,
and
,
with
an
usual
and
highly
commendable
freedom
,
after
first
exaggerate
the
distressed
circumstance
in
which
the
count
be
then
involve
,
impute
all
his
misfortune
to
that
cursed
itch
of
play
which
,
he
say
,
he
conclude
have
bring
his
present
confinement
upon
him
,
and
must
unavoidably
end
in
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
with
great
alacrity
,
defend
his
favourite
amusement
(
or
rather
employment
)
,
and
,
have
tell
his
friend
the
great
success
he
have
after
his
unluckily
quit
the
room
,
acquaint
him
with
the
accident
which
follow
,
and
which
the
reader
,
as
well
as
Mr.
Wild
,
hath
have
some
intimation
of
before
;
add
,
however
,
one
circumstance
not
hitherto
mentioned
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
defend
his
money
with
the
utmost
bravery
,
and
have
dangerously
wound
at
least
two
of
the
three
man
that
have
attack
him
.
<EOS>
this
behaviour
Wild
,
who
not
only
know
the
extreme
readiness
with
which
the
booty
have
be
deliver
,
but
also
the
constant
frigidity
of
the
count
's
courage
,
highly
applauded
,
and
wish
he
have
be
present
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
the
count
then
proceed
to
animadvert
on
the
carelessness
of
the
watch
,
and
the
scandal
it
be
to
the
law
that
honest
people
could
not
walk
the
street
in
safety
;
and
,
after
expatiate
some
time
on
that
subject
,
he
ask
Mr.
Wild
if
he
ever
see
so
prodigious
a
run
of
luck
(
for
so
he
choose
to
call
his
winning
,
though
he
know
Wild
be
well
acquaint
with
his
have
loaded
dice
in
his
pocket
)
.
<EOS>
the
other
answer
it
be
indeed
prodigious
,
and
almost
sufficient
to
justify
any
person
who
do
not
know
him
better
in
suspect
his
fair
play
.
"
<EOS>
no

I
believe
,
dare
call
that
in
question

reply
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
surely

"
say
Wild
;
"
you
be
well
known
to
be
a
man
of
more
honour

relate
to
MISS

which
 
perhaps
MAY
not
GREATLY
SURPRISE
<EOS>
after
the
former
.
<EOS>
the
description
of
a
very
fine
GENTLEMAN

and
a
dialogue
between
WILD
and
the
COUNT

in
which
public
VIRTUE
be
just

<EOS>
Mr.

have
turn
the
key
a
very
few
minute
before
a
servant
of
the
family
call
Mr.
Bagshot
out
of
the
room
,
tell
him
there
be
a
person
below
who
desire
to
speak
with
him
;
and
this
be
no
other
than
Miss
Laetitia
Snap
,
whose
admirer
Mr.
Bagshot
have
long
be
,
and
in
whose
tender
breast
his
passion
have
raise
a
more
ardent
flame
than
that
which
any
of
his
rival
have
be
able
to
raise
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
so
extremely
fond
of
this
youth
,
that
she
often
confess
to
her
female
confident
,
<EOS>
if
she
could
ever
have
listen
to
the
thought
of
live
with
any
one
man
,
Mr.

be
he
.
<EOS>
nor
be
she
singular
in
this
inclination
,
many
other
young
lady
be
her
rival
in
this
matter
,
who
have
all
the
great
and
noble
qualification
necessary
to
form
a
true
gallant
,
and
which
nature
be
seldom
so
extremely
bountiful
as
to
indulge
to
any
one
person
.
<EOS>
We
will
endeavour
,
however
,
to
describe
them
all
with
as
much
exactness
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
six
foot
high
,
have
large
calf
,
broad
shoulder
,
a
ruddy
complexion
,
with
brown
curled
hair
,
a
modest
assurance
,
and
clean
linen
.
<EOS>
He
have
indeed
,
it
must
be
confess
,
some
small
deficiency
to
counterbalance
these
heroic
quality
;
for
he
be
the
silly
fellow
in
the
world
,
could
neither
write
nor
read
,
nor
have
he
a
single
grain
or
spark
of
honour
,
honesty
,

good
-
nature

in
his
whole
composition

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr.
Bagshot
have
quit
the
room
the
count
,
take
Wild
by
the
hand
,
tell
him
he
have
something
to
communicate
to
him
of
very
great
importance
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
well
convinced
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
Bagshot
be
the
person
who
rob
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wild
start
with
great
amazement
at
this
discovery
,
and
answer
,
with
a
most
serious
countenance
,
"
I
advise
you
to
take
care
how
you
cast
any
such
reflection
on
a
man
of
Mr.
Bagshot
's
nice
honour
,
for
I
be
certain
he
will
not
bear
it
.

<EOS>
"
D####n
his
honour
!
"
<EOS>
quoth
the
enraged
count
;
"
nor
can
I
bear
be
rob
;
I
will
apply
to
a
justice
of
peace

"
<EOS>
Wild
reply
,
with
great
indignation
,
"
since
you
dare
entertain
<EOS>
such
a
suspicion
against
my
friend
<EOS>
,
I
will
henceforth
disclaim
all
acquaintance
with
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bagshot
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
my
friend
,
and
consequently
it
be
impossible
he
should
be
guilty
of
a
bad
action
.
"
<EOS>
He
add
much
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
which
have
not
the
expect
weight
with
the
count
;
for
the
latter
seem
still
certain
as
to
the
person
,
and
resolute
in
apply
for
justice
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
think
he
owe
to
the
public
as
well
as
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Wild
then
change
his
countenance
into
a
kind
of
derision
,
and
speak
as
follow
<EOS>
:
"
suppose
it
should
be
possible
that
Mr.
Bagshot
have
,
in
a
frolic
(
for
I
will
call
it
no
other
)
,
take
this
method
of
borrow
your
money
,
what
will
you
get
by
prosecute
him
?
<EOS>
not
your
money
again
,
for
you
hear
he
be
strip
at
the
gaming
-
table
(
of
which
Bagshot
have
during
their
short
confabulation
inform
them
)
;
you
will
get
then
an
opportunity
of
be
still
more
out
of
pocket
by
the
prosecution
.
<EOS>
another
advantage
you
may
promise
yourself
be
the
be
blow
up
at
every
gaming
-
house
in
town
,
for
that
I
will
assure
you
of
;
and
then
much
good
may
it
do
you
to
sit
down
with
the
satisfaction
of
have
discharge
what
it
seem
you
owe
the
public
.
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
of
my
own
discernment
when
I
mistake
you
for
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
for
you
to
receive
part
(
perhaps
all
)
of
your
money
again
by
a
wise
concealment
:
for
,
however
seedy
<EOS>
[
footnote
:
poor

]
<EOS>
Mr.
Bagshot
may
be
now
,
if
he
hath
really
play
this
frolic
with
you
,
you
may
believe
he
will
play
it
with
other
,
and
when
he
be
in
cash
you
may
depend
on
a
restoration
;
the
law
will
be
always
in
your
power
,
and
that
be
the
last
remedy
which
a
brave
or
a
wise
man
would
resort
to
.
<EOS>
leave
the
affair
therefore
to
me
;
I
will
examine
Bagshot
,
and
,
if
I
find
he
hath
play
you
this
trick
,
I
will
engage
my
own
honour
you
shall
in
the
end
<EOS>
be
no
loser

<EOS>
"
the
count
answer
,
"
if
I
be
sure
to
be
no
loser
,
Mr.
Wild
,
I
apprehend
you
have
a
well
opinion
of
my
understanding
than
to
imagine
I
would
prosecute
a
gentleman
for
the
sake
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
these
be
foolish
word
of
course
,
which
we
learn
a
ridiculous
habit
of
speak
,
and
will
often
break
from
us
without
any
design
or
meaning
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
all
I
desire
be
a
reimbursement
;
and
if
I
can
by
your
mean
obtain
that
,
the
public
may
;
"
conclude
with
a
phrase
too
coarse
to
be
insert
in
a
history
of
this
kind

<EOS>
They
be
now
inform
that
dinner
be
ready
,
and
the
company
assemble
below
stair
,
whither
the
reader
may
,
if
he
please
,
attend
these
gentleman

<EOS>
there
sit
down
at
the
table
Mr.

the
two
Miss
Snaps
his
daughter
,
Mr.
Wild
the
elder
,
Mr.
Wild
the
young
,
the
count
,
Mr.
Bagshot
,
and
a
grave
gentleman
who
have
formerly
have
the
honour
of
carry
arm
in
a
regiment
of
foot
,
and
who
be
now
engage
in
the
office
(
perhaps
a
more
profitable
one
)
of
assist
or
follow
Mr.
Snap
in
the
execution
of
the
law
of
his
country

<EOS>
nothing
very
remarkable
pass
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
(
as
be
usual
in
polite
company
)
roll
chiefly
on
what
they
be
then
eat
and
what
they
have
lately
eat
.
<EOS>
in
this
the
military
gentleman
,
who
have
serve
in
Ireland
,
give
them
a
very
particular
account
of
a
new
manner
of
roast
potato
,
and
other
give
an
account
of
other
dish
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
an
indifferent
by
-
stander
would
have
conclude
from
their
discourse
that
they
have
all
come
into
this
world
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
fill
their
belly
;
and
indeed
,
if
this
be
not
the
chief
,
it
be
probable
<EOS>
it
be
the
most
innocent
design
Nature
have
in
their
formation
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
DISH
be
remove
,
and
the
lady
retire
,
the
count
propose
a
game
at
hazard
,
which
be
immediately
assented
to
by
the
whole
company
,
and
,
the
dice
be
immediately
bring
in
,
the
count
take
up
the
box
and
demand
who
would
set
him
:
to
which
no
one
make
any
answer
,
imagine
perhaps
the
count
's
pocket
to
be
more
empty
than
they
be
;
for
,
in
reality
,
that
gentleman
(
notwithstanding
what
he
have
heartily
swear
to
Mr.
Wild
)
have
,
since
his
arrival
at
Mr.
Snap
's
,
convey
a
piece
of
plate
to
pawn
,
by
which
mean
he
have
furnish
himself
with
ten
guinea
.
<EOS>
the
count
,
therefore
,
perceive
this
backwardness
in
his
friend
,
and
probably
somewhat
guess
at
the
cause
of
it
,
take
the
say
guinea
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
throw
them
on
the
table
;
when
lo
,
(
such
be
the
force
of
example
)
all
the
rest
begin
to
produce
their
fund
,
and
immediately
,
a
considerable
sum
glitter
in
their
eye

the

begin

a

VAIN

WONDERFUL
STORY

NICE
a

HONOUR

<EOS>
My

I
believe
,
even
if
he
be
a
gamester
,
would
not
thank
me
for
an
exact
relation
of
every
man
's
success

let
it
suffice
then
that
they
play
till
the

vanish
from

<EOS>
whether
the
devil
himself
carry
it
away

as
some
suspect

I

not
determine

very
surprising
it
be
that
every
person
protest
he
have
lose

nor
could
any

guess

the
DEVIL

<EOS>

though
very
probable
it
be
that
this
arch
fiend
have
some
share
in
the
booty
<EOS>
,
it
be
likely
he
have
not
all
;
Mr.
Bagshot
be
imagine
to
be
a
considerable
winner
,
notwithstanding
his
assertion
to
the
contrary
;
for
he
be
see
by
several
to
convey
money
often
into
his
pocket
;
and
what
be
still
a
little
strong
presumption
be
,
that
the
grave
gentleman
whom
we
have
mention
to
have
serve
his
country
in
two
honourable
capacity
,
not
be
willing
to
trust
alone
to
the
evidence
of
his
eye
,
have
frequently
dive
into
the
say
Bagshot
's
pocket
,
whence
(
as
he
tell
us
in
the
apology
for
his
life
afterwards
publish

)
,
though
he
may
extract
a
few
piece
,
he
be
very
sensible
he
have
leave
many
behind
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
long
indulge
his
curiosity
in
this
way
before
Mr.
Bagshot
,
in
the
heat
of
gaming
,
have
perceive
him
;
but
,
as
Bagshot
be
now
leave
off
play
,
he
discover
this
ingenious
feat
of
dexterity
;
upon
which
,
leap
up
from
his
chair
in
violent
passion
,
he
cry
out
,
"
I
think
I
have
be
among
gentleman
and
man
of
honour
,
but
,
d####n
me
,
I
find
we
have
a
pickpocket
in
company
.
"
<EOS>
the
scandalous
sound
of
this
word
extremely
alarm
the
whole
board
,
nor
do
they
all
shew
less
surprise
than
the
CONV
 
n
(
whose
not
sit
of
late
be
much
lament
)
would
express
at
hear
there
be
an
atheist
in
the
room
;
but
it
more
particularly
affect
the
gentleman
at
whom
it
be
level
,
though
it
be
not
address
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
start
from
his
chair
,
and
,
with
a
fierce
countenance
and
accent
,
say
,
"
do
you
mean
me
?
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
your
eye
,
you
be
a
rascal
and
a
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
"
those
word
would
have
be
immediately
succeed
by
blow
have
not
the
company
interpose
,
and
with
strong
arm
withhold
the
two
antagonist
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
a
long
time
before
they
could
be
prevail
on
to
sit
down
;
which
be
at
last
happily
bring
about
,
Mr.
Wild
the
elder
,
who
be
a
well
-
dispose
old
man
,
advise
them
to
shake
hand
and
be
friend
;
but
the
gentleman
who
have
receive
the
first
affront
absolutely
refuse
it
,
and
swear
he
WOULD
have
the
VILLAIN
's
blood
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Snap
highly
applaud
the
resolution
,
and
affirm
that
the
affront
be
by
no
means
to
be
put
up
by
any
who
bear
the
name
of
a
gentleman
,
and
that
unless
his
friend
resent
it
properly
he
would
never
execute
another
warrant
in
his
company
;
that
he
have
always
look
upon
him
as
a
man
of
honour
,
and
doubt
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
he
would
prove
himself
so
;
and
that
,
if
it
be
his
own
case
,
nothing
should
persuade
him
to
put
up
such
an
affront
without
proper
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
count
likewise
speak
on
the
same
side
,
and
the
party
themselves
mutter
several
short
sentence
purport
their
intention
.
<EOS>
at
last
Mr.
Wild
,
our
hero
,
rise
slowly
from
his
seat
,
and
have
fix
the
attention
of
all
present
,
begin
as
follow
:
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
with
infinite
pleasure
everything
which
the
two
gentleman
who
speak
last
have
say
with
relation
to
honour
,
nor
can
any
man
possibly
entertain
a
high
and
noble
sense
of
that
word
,
nor
a
great
esteem
of
its
inestimable
value
,
than
myself
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
no
name
to
express
it
by
in
our
can
not
Dictionary
,
it
be
well
to
be
wish
we
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
the
essential
quality
of
a
gentleman
,
and
which
no
man
who
ever
be
great
in
the
field
or
on
the
road
(
as
other
express
it
)
can
possibly
be
without
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
gentleman
,
what
pity
be
it
that
a
word
of
such
sovereign
use
and
virtue
should
have
so
uncertain
and
various
an
application
that
scarce
two
people
mean
the
same
thing
by
it
?
<EOS>
do
not
some
by
honour
mean
good
-
nature
and
humanity
,
which
weak
mind
call
virtue
?
<EOS>
how
then
!
<EOS>
Must
we
deny
it
to
the
great
,
the
brave
,
the
noble
;
to
the
sacker
of
town
,
the
plunderer
of
province
,
and
the
conqueror
of
kingdom
!
<EOS>
be
not
these
man
of
honour
?
<EOS>
and
yet
they
scorn
those
pitiful
quality
I
have
mention
.
<EOS>
again
,
some
few
(
or
I
be
mistaken
)
include
the
idea
of
honesty
in
their
honour
.
<EOS>
and
shall
we
then
say
that
no
man
who
withhold
from
<EOS>
another
what
law
,
or
justice
perhaps
,
call
his
own
,
or
who
greatly
and
boldly
deprive
him
of
such
property
,
be
a
man
of
honour
?
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
say
so
in
this
,
or
,
indeed
,
in
any
other
good
company
!
<EOS>
be
honour
truth
?
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
not
in
the
lie
be
go
from
us
,
but
in
its
come
to
us
,
our
honour
be
injure
.
<EOS>
doth
it
then
consist
in
what
the
vulgar
call
cardinal
virtue
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
affront
to
your
understanding
to
suppose
it
,
since
we
see
every
day
so
many
man
of
honour
without
any
.
<EOS>
in
what
then
doth
the
word
honour
consist
?
<EOS>
why
,
in
itself
alone
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
honour
be
he
that
be
call
a
man
of
honour
;
and
while
he
be
so
call
he
so
remain
,
and
no
longer
.
<EOS>
think
not
anything
a
man
commit
can
forfeit
his
honour
.
<EOS>
look
abroad
into
the
world
;
the
PRIG
,
while
he
flourish
,
be
a
man
of
honour
;
when
in
gaol
,
at
the
bar
,
or
the
tree
,
he
be
so
no
longer
.
<EOS>
and
why
be
this
distinction
?
<EOS>
not
from
his
action
;
for
those
be
often
as
well
known
in
his
flourish
estate
as
they
be
afterwards
;
but
because
man
,
I
mean
those
of
his
own
party
or
gang
,
call
him
a
man
of
honour
in
the
former
,
and
cease
to
call
him
so
in
the
latter
condition
.
<EOS>
let
us
see
then
;
how
hath
Mr.
Bagshot
injure
the
gentleman
's
honour
?
<EOS>
why
,
he
hath
call
him
a
pick
-
pocket
;
and
that
,
probably
,
by
a
severe
construction
and
a
long
roundabout
way
of
reasoning
,
may
seem
a
little
to
derogate
from
his
honour
,
if
consider
in
a
very
nice
sense
.
<EOS>
admit
it
,
therefore
,
for
argument
's
sake
,
to
be
some
small
imputation
on
his
honour
,
let
Mr.
Bagshot
give
him
satisfaction
;
let
him
doubly
and
triply
repair
this
oblique
injury
by
directly
assert
that
he
believe
he
be
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
he
be
content
to
refer
it
to
Mr.
Wild
,
and
whatever
satisfaction
he
think
sufficient
he
would
accept
.
"
<EOS>
let
him
give
me
my
money
again
first
,
"
say
Bagshot
,
"
and
then
I
will
call
him
a
man
of
honour
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
then
protest
he
have
not
any
,
which
Snap
second
,
declare
he
have
his
eye
on
him
all
the
while
;
but
Bagshot
remain
still
unsatisfied
,
till
Wild
,
rap
out
a
hearty
oath
,
swear
he
have
not
take
a
single
farthing
,
add
that
whoever
assert
the
contrary
give
him
the
lie
,
and
he
would
resent
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
such
be
the
ascendancy
of
this
great
man
,
that
Bagshot
immediately
acquiesce
,
and
perform
the
ceremony
require
:
and
thus
,
by
the
exquisite
address
of
our
hero
,
this
quarrel
,
which
have
so
fatal
an
aspect
,
and
which
between
two
person
so
extremely
jealous
of
their
honour
would
most
certainly
have
produce
very
dreadful
consequence
,
be
happily
conclude
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
be
indeed
a
little
interested
in
this
affair
,
as
he
himself
have
set
the
gentleman
to
work
,
and
have
receive
the
great
part
of
the
booty
:
and
as
to
Mr.
Snap
's
deposition
in
his
favour
,
it
be
the
usual
height
to
which
the
ardour
of
that
worthy
person
's
friendship
too
frequently
hurry
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
constant
maxim
that
he
be
a
pitiful
fellow
who
would
stick
at
a
little
rapping
<EOS>
[
Footnote
:
rapping
be
a
can
not
word
for
perjury

]
<EOS>
for
his
friend

<EOS>
in
which
the
history
of
GREATNESS

CONTINUED

<EOS>
matter
be
thus
reconcile
,
and
the
gaming
over
,
from
reason
before
hint
,
the
company
proceed
to
drink
about
with
the
utmost
chearfulness
and
friendship
;
drink
health
,
shake
hand
,
and
profess
the
most
perfect
affection
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
all
which
be
not
in
the
least
interrupt
by
some
design
which
they
then
agitate
in
their
mind
,
and
which
they
intend
to
execute
as
soon
as
the
liquor
have
prevail
over
some
of
their
understanding
.
<EOS>
Bagshot
and
the
gentleman
intend
to
rob
each
other
;
Mr.
Snap
and
Mr.
Wild
the
eld
meditate
what
other
creditor
they
could
find
out
to
charge
the
gentleman
then
in
custody
with
;
the
count
hope
to
renew
the
play
,
and
Wild
,
our
hero
,
lay
a
design
to
put
Bagshot
out
of
the
way
,
or
,
as
the
vulgar
express
it
,
to
hang
him
with
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
but
none
of
these
great
design
could
at
present
be
put
in
execution
,
for
,
Mr.
Snap
be
soon
after
summon
abroad
on
business
of
great
moment
,
which
require
likewise
the
assistance
of
Mr.
Wild
the
elder
and
his
other
friend
,
and
as
he
do
not
care
to
trust
to
the
nimbleness
of
the
count
's
heel
,
of
which
he
have
already
have
some
experience
,
he
declare
he
must
lock
up
for
that
evening
.
<EOS>
here
,
reader
,
if
them
pleasest
,
as
we
be
in
no
great
haste
,
we
will
stop
and
make
a
simile
.
<EOS>
as
when
their
lap
be
finish
,
the
cautious
huntsman
to
their
kennel
gather
the
nimble
-
foot
hound
,
they
with
lank
ears
and
tail
slouch
sullenly
on
,
whilst
he
,
with
his
whipper
-
in
,
follow
close
at
their
heel
,
regardless
of
their
dog
humour
,
till
,
have
see
them
safe
within
the
door
,
he
turn
the
key
,
and
then
retire
to
whatever
business
or
pleasure
call
him
thence
;
so
with
lowre
countenance
and
reluctant
step
mount
the
count
and
Bagshot
to
their
chamber
,
or
rather
kennel
,
whither
they
be
attend
by
Snap
and
those
who
follow
him
,
and
where
Snap
,
have
see
them
deposit
,
very
contentedly
lock
the
door
and
depart
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
reader
,
we
will
,
in
imitation
of
the
truly
laudable
custom
of
the
world
,
leave
these
our
good
friend
to
deliver
themselves
as
they
can
,
and
pursue
the
thriving
fortune
of
Wild
,
our
hero
,
who
,
with
that
great
aversion
to
satisfaction
and
content
which
be
inseparably
incident
to
great
mind
,
begin
to
enlarge
his
view
with
his
prosperity
:
for
this
restless
,
amiable
disposition
,
this
noble
avidity
which
increase
with
feeding
,
be
the
first
principle
or
constituent
quality
of
these
our
great
man
;
to
whom
,
in
their
passage
on
to
greatness
,
it
happen
as
to
a
traveller
over
the
Alps
,
or
,
if
this
be
a
too
far
-
fetched
simile
,
to
one
who
travel
westward
over
the
hill
near
Bath
,
where
the
simile
be
indeed
make
.
<EOS>
He
see
not
the
end
of
his
journey
at
once
;
but
,
pass
on
from
scheme
to
scheme
,
and
from
hill
to
hill
,
with
noble
constancy
,
resolve
still
to
attain
the
summit
on
which
he
hath
fix
his
eve
,
however
dirty
the
road
may
be
through
which
he
struggle
,
he
at
length
arrive
 
at
some
vile
inn
,
where
he
find
no
kind
of
entertainment
nor
conveniency
for
repose
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
reader
,
if
thou
hast
ever
travel
in
these
road
,
one
part
of
my
simile
be
sufficiently
apparent
(
and
,
indeed
,
in
all
these
illustration
,
one
side
be
generally
much
more
apparent
than
the
other
)
;
but
,
believe
me
,
if
the
other
doth
not
so
evidently
appear
to
thy
satisfaction
,
it
be
from
no
other
reason
than
because
thou
art
unacquainte
with
these
great
man
,
and
hast
not
have
sufficient
instruction
,
leisure
,
or
opportunity
,
to
consider
what
happen
to
those
who
pursue
what
be
generally
understand
by
GREATNESS
:
for
surely
,
if
thou
hadst
animadvert
,
not
only
on
the
many
peril
to
which
great
man
be
daily
liable
while
they
be
in
their
progress
,
but
hadst
discern
,
as
it
be
through
a
microscope
(
for
it
be
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
)
,
that
diminutive
speck
of
happiness
which
they
attain
even
in
the
consummation
of
their
wish
,
thou
wouldst
lament
with
me
<EOS>
the
unhappy
fate
of
these
great
man
,
on
whom
nature
hath
set
so
superior
a
mark
,
that
the
rest
of
mankind
be
bear
for
their
use
and
emolument
only
,
and
be
apt
to
cry
out
<EOS>
,
"
It
be
pity
that
those
for
whose
pleasure
and
profit
mankind
be
to
labour
and
sweat
,
to
be
hack
and
hew
,
to
be
pillage
,
plunder
,
and
every
war
destroy
,
should
reap
so
little
advantage
from
all
the
misery
they
occasion
to
other
.
"
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
own
myself
of
that
humble
kind
of
mortal
who
consider
themselves
bear
for
the
behoof
of
some
great
man
or
other
,
and
could
I
behold
his
happiness
carve
out
of
the
labour
and
ruin
of
a
thousand
such
reptile
as
myself
<EOS>
I
may
with
satisfaction
exclaim
,
Sic
,
sic
juvat
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
behold
one
GREAT
man
starve
with
hunger
and
freeze
with
cold
,
in
the
midst
of
fifty
thousand
who
be
suffer
the
same
evil
for
his
diversion
;
when
I
see
another
,
whose
own
mind
be
a
more
abject
slave
to
his
own
greatness
,
and
be
more
tortured
and
rack
by
it
,
than
those
of
all
his
vassal
;
lastly
,
when
I
consider
whole
nation
root
out
only
to
bring
tear
into
the
eye
of
a
great
man
,
not
indeed
because
he
hath
extirpate
so
many
,
but
because
he
have
no
more
nation
to
extirpate
,
then
truly
I
be
almost
inclined
to
wish
that
Nature
have
spare
us
this
her
MASTERPIECE
,
and
that
no
GREAT
MAN
have
ever
be
bear
into
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
proceed
with
our
history
,
which
will
,
we
hope
,
produce
much
well
lesson
,
and
more
instructive
,
than
any
we
can
preach
:
Wild
be
no
sooner
retire
to
a
night
-
cellar
than
he
begin
to
reflect
on
the
sweet
he
have
that
day
enjoy
from
the
labour
of
other
,
viz
.
,
first
,
from
Mr.
Bagshot
,
who
have
for
his
use
rob
the
count
;
and
,
secondly
,
from
the
gentleman
,
who
,
for
the
same
good
purpose
,
have
pick
the
pocket
of
Bagshot
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
reason
thus
with
himself
:
"
the
art
of
policy
be
the
art
of
multiplication
,
the
degree
of
greatness
being
constitute
by
those
two
little
word
more
or
LESS
.
<EOS>
mankind
be
first
properly
to
be
consider
under
two
grand
division
,
those
that
use
their
own
hand
,
and
those
who
employ
the
hand
of
other
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
the
base
and
rabble
;
the
latter
,
the
genteel
part
of
the
creation
.
<EOS>
the
mercantile
part
of
the
world
,
therefore
,
wisely
use
of
the
term
EMPLOYING
hand
,
and
justly
prefer
each
other
as
they
employ
more
or
few
;
for
thus
one
merchant
say
he
be
great
than
another
because
he
employ
more
hand
.
<EOS>
and
now
indeed
the
merchant
should
seem
to
challenge
some
character
of
greatness
,
do
we
not
necessarily
come
to
a
second
division
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
of
those
who
employ
hand
for
the
use
of
the
community
in
which
they
live
,
and
of
those
who
employ
hand
merely
for
their
own
use
,
without
any
regard
to
the
benefit
of
society
.
<EOS>
of
the
former
sort
be
the
yeoman
,
the
manufacturer
,
the
merchant
,
and
perhaps
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
be
to
manure
and
cultivate
his
native
soil
,
and
to
employ
hand
to
produce
the
fruit
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
the
second
being
to
improve
them
by
employ
hand
likewise
,
and
to
produce
from
them
those
useful
commodity
which
serve
as
well
for
the
convenience
as
necessary
of
life
.
<EOS>
the
third
be
to
employ
hand
for
the
exportation
of
the
redundance
of
our
own
commodity
,
and
to
exchange
them
with
the
redundance
of
foreign
nation
,
that
thus
every
soil
and
every
climate
may
enjoy
the
fruit
of
the
whole
earth
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
,
by
employ
hand
,
likewise
to
embellish
his
country
with
the
improvement
of
art
and
science
,
with
the
make
and
execute
good
and
wholesome
law
for
the
preservation
of
property
and
the
distribution
of
justice
,
and
in
several
other
manner
to
be
useful
to
society
.
<EOS>
now
we
come
to
the
second
part
of
this
division
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
of
those
who
employ
hand
for
their
own
use
only
;
and
this
be
that
noble
and
great
part
who
be
generally
distinguish
into
conqueror
,
absolute
prince
,
statesman
,
and
prig
<EOS>
[
footnote
:
thief
.
]
.
<EOS>
now
all
these
differ
from
each
other
in
greatness
only
 
they
employ
MORE
or
few
hand
.
<EOS>
and
Alexander
the
Great
be
only
GREATER
than
a
captain
of
one
of
the
tartarian
or
arabian
horde
,
as
he
be
at
the
head
of
a
large
number
.
<EOS>
in
what
then
be
a
single
prig
inferior
to
any
other
great
man
,
but
because
he
employ
his
own
hand
only
;
for
he
be
not
on
that
account
to
be
level
with
the
base
and
vulgar
,
because
he
employ
his
hand
for
his
own
use
only
.
<EOS>
now
,
suppose
a
prig
have
as
many
tool
as
any
prime
minister
ever
have
,
would
he
not
be
as
great
as
any
prime
minister
whatsoever
?
<EOS>
undoubtedly
he
would
.
<EOS>
what
then
have
I
to
do
in
the
pursuit
of
greatness
but
to
procure
a
gang
,
and
to
make
the
use
of
this
gang
centre
in
myself
?
<EOS>
this
gang
shall
rob
for
me
only
,
receive
very
moderate
reward
for
their
action
;
out
of
this
gang
I
will
prefer
to
my
favour
the
bold
and
most
iniquitous
(
as
the
vulgar
express
it
)
;
the
rest
I
will
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
I
see
occasion
,
transport
and
hang
at
my
pleasure
;
and
thus
(
which
I
take
to
be
the
high
excellence
of
a
prig
)
convert
those
law
which
be
make
for
the
benefit
and
protection
of
society
to
my
single
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
thus
preconceive
his
scheme
,
he
see
nothing
want
to
put
it
in
immediate
execution
but
that
which
be
indeed
the
beginning
as
well
as
the
end
of
all
human
device
:
<EOS>
I
mean
money
.
<EOS>
of
which
commodity
he
be
possess
of
no
more
than
sixty
-
five
guinea
,
be
all
that
remain
from
the
double
benefit
he
have
make
of
Bagshot
,
and
which
do
not
seem
sufficient
to
furnish
his
house
,
and
every
other
convenience
necessary
for
so
grand
an
undertaking
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
go
immediately
to
the
gaming
-
house
,
which
be
then
sit
,
not
so
much
with
an
intention
of
trust
to
fortune
as
to
play
the
sure
card
of
attack
the
winner
in
his
way
home
.
<EOS>
on
his
arrival
,
however
,
he
think
he
may
as
well
try
his
success
at
the
dice
,
and
reserve
the
other
resource
as
his
last
expedient
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
sit
down
to
play
;
and
as
Fortune
,
no
more
than
other
of
her
sex
,
be
observe
to
distribute
her
favour
with
strict
regard
to
great
mental
endowment
,
so
our
hero
lose
every
farthing
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
this
loss
however
he
bear
with
great
constancy
of
mind
,
and
with
as
great
composure
of
aspect
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
he
consider
the
money
as
only
lend
for
a
short
time
,
or
rather
indeed
as
deposit
with
a
banker
.
<EOS>
He
then
resolve
to
have
immediate
recourse
to
his
sure
stratagem
;
and
,
cast
his
eye
round
the
room
,
he
soon
perceive
a
gentleman
sit
in
a
disconsolate
posture
,
who
seem
a
proper
instrument
or
tool
for
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
short
(
to
be
as
concise
as
possible
in
these
least
shine
part
of
our
history
)
,
Wild
accost
this
man
,
sound
him
,
find
him
fit
to
execute
,
propose
the
matter
,
receive
a
ready
assent
,
and
,
have
fix
on
the
person
who
seem
that
evening
the
great
favourite
of
Fortune
,
they
post
themselves
in
the
most
proper
place
to
surprise
the
enemy
as
he
be
retire
to
his
quarter
,
where
he
be
soon
attack
,
subdue
,
and
plunder
;
but
indeed
of
no
considerable
booty
;
for
it
seem
this
gentleman
play
on
a
common
stock
,
and
have
deposit
his
winning
at
the
scene
of
action
,
nor
have
he
any
more
than
two
shilling
in
his
pocket
when
he
be
attack
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
cruel
a
disappointment
to
Wild
,
and
so
sensibly
affect
us
,
as
no
doubt
it
will
the
reader
,
that
,
as
it
must
disqualify
us
both
from
proceed
any
farther
at
present
,
we
will
now
take
a
little
breath
,
and
therefore
we
shall
here
close
this
book
.
  
<EOS>
book
II
   
character
of
SILLY
PEOPLE
,
with
the
PROPER
use
for
which
<EOS>
SUCH
are
designed
.
 
<EOS>
one
reason
why
we
choose
to
end
our
first
book
,
as
we
do
,
with
the
last
chapter
,
be
,
that
we
be
now
oblige
to
produce
two
character
of
a
stamp
entirely
different
from
what
we
have
hitherto
deal
in
.
<EOS>
these
person
be
of
that
pitiful
order
of
mortal
who
be
in
contempt
call
good
-
natured
;
be
indeed
send
into
the
world
by
nature
with
the
same
design
with
which
man
put
little
fish
into
a
pike
-
pond
,
in
order
to
be
devour
by
that
voracious
water
-
hero
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
proceed
with
our
history
:
Wild
,
have
share
the
booty
in
much
the
same
manner
as
before
,
i.e.
take
three
-
fourth
of
it
,
amount
to
eighteen
-
penny
,
be
now
retire
to
rest
,
in
no
very
happy
mood
,
when
by
accident
he
meet
with
a
young
fellow
who
have
formerly
be
his
companion
,
and
indeed
intimate
friend
,
at
school
.
<EOS>
It
hath
be
think
that
friendship
be
usually
nurse
by
similitude
of
manner
,
but
the
contrary
have
be
the
case
between
these
lad
;
for
whereas
Wild
be
rapacious
and
intrepid
,
the
other
have
always
more
regard
far
his
skin
than
his
money
;
Wild
therefore
have
very
generously
compassionate
this
defect
in
his
school
-
fellow
,
and
have
bring
him
off
from
many
scrape
,
into
most
of
which
he
have
first
draw
him
,
by
take
the
fault
and
whip
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
indeed
be
well
pay
on
such
occasion
;
there
be
a
sort
of
people
who
,
together
with
the
good
of
the
bargain
,
will
be
sure
to
have
the
obligation
too
on
their
side
;
so
it
have
happen
here
:
for
this
poor
lad
have
consider
himself
in
the
high
degree
oblige
to
Mr.
Wild
,
and
have
contract
a
very
great
esteem
and
friendship
for
him
;
the
trace
of
which
an
absence
of
many
year
have
not
in
the
least
effaced
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
know
Wild
,
therefore
,
than
he
accost
him
in
the
most
friendly
manner
,
and
invite
him
home
with
him
to
breakfast
(
it
be
now
near
nine
in
the
morning
)
,
which
invitation
our
hero
with
no
great
difficulty
consent
to
.
<EOS>
this
young
man
,
who
be
about
Wild
's
age
,
have
some
time
before
set
up
in
the
trade
of
a
jeweller
,
in
the
material
or
stock
for
which
he
have
lay
out
the
great
part
of
a
little
fortune
,
and
have
marry
a
very
agreeable
woman
for
love
,
by
whom
he
then
have
two
child
.
<EOS>
as
our
reader
be
to
be
more
acquaint
with
this
person
,
it
may
not
be
improper
to
open
somewhat
of
his
character
,
especially
as
it
will
serve
as
a
kind
of
foil
to
the
noble
and
great
disposition
of
our
hero
,
and
as
the
one
seem
send
into
this
world
as
a
proper
object
on
which
the
talent
of
the
other
be
to
be
display
with
a
proper
and
just
success
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thomas
Heartfree
then
(
for
that
be
his
name
)
be
of
an
honest
and
open
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
that
sort
of
man
whom
experience
only
,
and
not
their
own
nature
,
must
inform
that
there
be
such
thing
as
deceit
and
hypocrisy
in
the
world
,
and
who
,
consequently
,
be
not
at
five
-
and
-
twenty
so
difficult
to
be
impose
upon
as
the
old
and
most
subtle
.
<EOS>
He
be
possess
of
several
great
weakness
of
mind
,
be
good
-
natured
,
friendly
,
and
generous
to
a
great
excess
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
too
little
regard
to
common
justice
,
for
he
have
forgive
some
debt
to
his
acquaintance
only
because
they
could
not
pay
him
,
and
have
entrust
a
bankrupt
,
on
his
set
up
a
second
time
,
from
have
be
convince
that
he
have
deal
in
his
bankruptcy
with
a
fair
and
honest
heart
,
and
that
he
have
break
through
misfortune
only
,
and
not
from
neglect
or
imposture
.
<EOS>
He
be
withal
so
silly
a
fellow
that
he
never
take
the
least
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
his
customer
,
and
content
himself
with
very
moderate
gain
on
his
good
;
which
he
be
the
well
enable
to
do
,
notwithstanding
his
generosity
,
because
his
life
be
extremely
temperate
,
his
expense
be
solely
confine
to
the
chearful
entertainment
of
his
friend
at
home
,
and
now
and
then
a
moderate
glass
of
wine
,
in
which
he
indulge
himself
in
the
company
of
his
wife
,
who
,
with
an
agreeable
person
,
be
a
mean
-
spirited
,
poor
,
domestic
,
low
-
breed
animal
,
who
confine
herself
mostly
to
the
care
of
her
family
,
place
her
happiness
in
her
husband
and
her
child
,
follow
no
expensive
fashion
or
diversion
,
and
indeed
rarely
go
abroad
,
unless
to
return
the
visit
of
a
few
plain
neighbour
,
and
twice
a
-
year
afford
herself
,
in
company
with
her
husband
,
the
diversion
of
a
play
,
where
she
never
sit
in
a
high
place
than
the
pit
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
silly
woman
do
this
silly
fellow
introduce
the
GREAT
WILD
,
inform
her
at
the
same
time
of
their
school
acquaintance
and
the
many
obligation
he
have
receive
from
him
.
<EOS>
this
simple
woman
no
sooner
hear
her
husband
have
be
oblige
to
her
guest
than
her
eye
sparkle
on
him
with
a
benevolance
which
be
an
emanation
from
the
heart
,
and
<EOS>
of
which
great
and
noble
mind
,
whose
heart
never
dwell
but
with
an
injury
,
can
have
no
very
adequate
idea
;
it
be
therefore
no
wonder
that
our
hero
should
misconstrue
,
as
he
do
,
the
poor
,
innocent
,
and
ample
affection
of
Mrs.
Heartfree
towards
her
husband
's
friend
,
for
that
great
and
generous
passion
,
which
fire
the
eye
of
a
modern
heroine
,
when
the
colonel
be
so
kind
as
to
indulge
his
city
creditor
with
partaking
of
his
table
to
-
day
,
and
of
his
bed
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
wild
,
therefore
,
instantly
return
the
compliment
as
he
understand
it
,
with
his
eye
,
and
presently
after
bestow
many
encomium
on
her
beauty
,
with
which
,
perhaps
,
she
,
who
be
a
woman
,
though
a
good
one
,
and
misapprehend
the
design
,
be
not
displease
any
more
than
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
when
breakfast
be
end
,
and
the
wife
retire
to
her
household
affair
,
Wild
,
who
have
a
quick
discernment
into
the
weakness
of
man
,
and
who
,
besides
the
knowledge
of
his
good
(
or
foolish
)
disposition
when
a
boy
,
have
now
discover
several
spark
of
goodness
,
friendship
,
and
generosity
in
his
friend
,
begin
to
discourse
over
the
accident
which
have
happen
in
their
childhood
,
and
take
frequent
occasion
of
remind
him
of
those
favour
which
we
have
before
mention
his
have
confer
on
him
;
he
then
proceed
to
the
most
vehement
profession
of
friendship
,
and
to
the
most
ardent
expression
of
joy
in
this
renewal
of
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
at
last
tell
him
,
with
great
seeming
pleasure
,
that
he
believe
he
have
an
opportunity
of
serve
him
by
the
recommendation
of
a
gentleman
to
his
custom
,
who
be
then
on
the
brink
of
marriage

<EOS>
and
,
if
he
be
not
already
engage
,
I
will

say
he

endeavour
to
prevail
on
him

Heartfree
be

<EOS>
but
here
,
as
it
occur
to
our
memory
that
our
reader
may
be
surprised
(
an
accident
which
sometimes
happen
in
history
of
this
kind
)
how
Mr.
Wild
,
the
elder
,
in
his
present
capacity
,
should
have
be
able
to
maintain
his
son
at
a
reputable
school
,
as
this
appear
to
have
be
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
inform
him
that
Mr.
Wild
himself
be
then
a
tradesman
in
good
business
,
but
,
by
misfortune
in
the

,
to
wit
,
extravagance
and
gaming

he
have
reduce
himself
to
that
honourable
occupation
which
we
have
formerly
mention

<EOS>
have
clear
up
this
doubt
,
we
will
now
pursue
our

who
forthwith
repair
to
the
count

,
have
first
settle
preliminary
article
concern

he
acquaint
him
with
the

have
form
against
Heartfree

after
consult
proper
method
to
put
it
in
execution
,
they
begin
to
concert
measure
for
the
enlargement
of
the
count

on
which
the
first
,
and
indeed
only
point
to
be
consider
,
be
to
raise
money
,
not
to
pay
his

,
for
that
would
have
require
an
immense
sum
,
and
be
contrary
to
his
inclination
or
intention
,
but
to
procure
him
bail
;
for
as
to
his
escape
,
Mr.
Snap
have
take
such
precaution
that
it

absolutely
impossible

<EOS>
great
example
of
GREATNESS
in
WILD
,
<EOS>
SHEWN
as
<EOS>
WELL
by
his
behaviour
to
bagshot
as
in
a
scheme
laid
,
first
,
to
impose
on
heartfree
by
mean
of
the
COUNT
,
and
then
to
cheat
the
COUNT
of
the
BOOTY

<EOS>
Wild
undertake
therefore
to
extract
some
money
from
Bagshot
,
who
,
notwithstanding
the
depredation
make
on
him
,
have
carry
off
a
pretty
considerable

He
find
Mr.

with
a
countenance
full

wonderful

tell

that
all

that
the

intend
to
prosecute
him
for
the
robbery

"
have
not
I
exert
(
say
he
)

my

reply
Wild

"
be
this
your

<EOS>
for
your

can
give

"
<EOS>
"

come
up

<EOS>
quoth
Bagshot
<EOS>
;
"
I
believe
my

<EOS>
I
know
those

do
you
tell
me
of

<EOS>
"
yes

"
answer
our

,
take
him
by
the
collar
;
"
and
since
you
dare
threaten
me
I
will
shew
you
<EOS>
the
difference
between
commit
a
robbery
and
conniving
at
it
,
which
be
all
I
can
charge
myself
with
.
<EOS>
I
own
indeed
I
suspect
,
when
you
shew
me
a
sum
of
money
,
that
you
have
not
come
honestly
by
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Bagshot
,
frighten
out
of
one
half
of
his
wit
,
and
amaze
out
of
the
other
,
"
can
you
deny
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
rascal
,
"
answer
Wild
,
"
I
do
deny
everything
;
and
do
you
find
a
witness
to
prove
it
:
and
,
to
shew
you
<EOS>
how
little
apprehension
I
have
of
your
power
to
hurt
me
,
I
will
have
you
apprehend
this
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
offer
to
break
from
him
;
but
Bagshot
lay
hold
of
his
skirt
,
and
,
with
an
altered
tone
and
manner
,
beg
him
not
to
be
so
impatient
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
refund
then
,
sirrah
,
"
cry
Wild
,
"
and
perhaps
I
may
take
pity
on
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
must
I
refund
?
"
answer
Bagshot
.
<EOS>
"
every
farthing
in
your
pocket
,
"
reply
Wild
;
"
then
I
may
have
some
compassion
on
you
,
and
not
only
save
your
life
,
but
,
out
of
an
excess
of
generosity
,
may
return
you
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
Bagshot
seem
to
hesitate
,
Wild
pretend
to
make
to
the
door
,
and
rapt
out
an
oath
of
vengeance
with
so
violent
an
emphasis
,
that
his
friend
no
longer
presume
to
balance
,
but
suffer
Wild
to
search
his
pocket
and
draw
forth
all
he
find
,
to
the
amount
of
twenty
-
one
guinea
and
a
half
,
which
last
piece
our
generous
hero
return
him
again
,
tell
him
he
may
now
sleep
secure
.
<EOS>
but
advise
him
for
the
future
never
to
threaten
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
thus
do
our
hero
execute
the
great
exploit
with
the
utmost
ease
imaginable
,
by
mean
of
those
transcendent
quality
which
nature
have
indulge
him
with
,
viz
.
,
a
bold
heart
,
a
thundering
voice
,
and
a
steady
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
now
return
to
the
count
,
and
inform
him
that
he
have
get
ten
guinea
of
Bagshot
;
for
,
with
great
and
commendable
prudence
,
he
sink
the
other
eleven
into
his
own
pocket
,
and
tell
him
with
that
money
he
would
procure
him
bail
,
which
he
after
prevail
on
his
father
,
and
another
gentleman
of
the
same
occupation
,
to
become
,
for
two
guinea
each
,
so
that
he
make
lawful
prize
of
six
more
,
make
Bagshot
debtor
for
the
whole
ten
;
for
such
be
his
great
ability
,
and
so
vast
the
compass
of
his
understanding
,
that
he
never
make
any
bargain
without
overreach
(
or
,
in
the
vulgar
phrase
,
cheat
)
<EOS>
the
person
with
whom
he
deal
.
  
<EOS>
the
count
be
,
by
these
mean
,
enlarge
,
the
first
thing
they
do
,
in
order
to
procure
credit
from
tradesman
,
be
the
take
a
handsome
house
ready
furnish
in
one
of
the
new
street
;
in
which
as
soon
as
the
count
be
settle
,
they
proceed
to
furnish
him
with
servant
and
equipage
,
and
all
the
insignia
of
a
large
estate
proper
to
impose
on
poor
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
these
be
all
obtain
,
Wild
make
a
second
visit
to
his
friend
,
and
with
much
joy
in
his
countenance
acquaint
him
that
he
have
succeed
in
his
endeavour
,
and
that
the
gentleman
have
promise
to
deal
with
him
for
the
jewel
which
he
intend
to
present
his
bride
,
and
which
be
design
to
be
very
splendid
and
costly
;
he
therefore
appoint
him
to
go
to
the
count
the
next
morning
,
and
carry
with
him
a
set
of
the
rich
and
most
beautiful
jewel
he
have
,
give
him
at
the
same
time
some
hint
of
the
count
's
ignorance
of
that
commodity
,
and
that
he
may
extort
what
price
of
him
he
please
;
but
Heartfree
tell
him
,
not
without
some
disdain
,
that
he
scorn
to
take
any
such
advantage
;
and
,
after
express
much
gratitude
to
his
friend
for
his
recommendation
,
he
promise
to
carry
the
jewel
at
the
hour
and
to
the
place
appoint
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sensible
that
the
reader
,
if
he
hath
but
the
least
notion
of
greatness
,
must
have
such
a
contempt
for
the
extreme
folly
of
this
fellow
,
that
he
will
be
very
little
concerned
at
any
misfortune
which
may
befal
him
in
the
sequel
;
for
to
have
no
suspicion
that
an
old
schoolfellow
,
with
whom
he
have
,
in
his
tender
year
,
contract
a
friendship
,
and
who
,
on
the
accidental
renewing
of
their
acquaintance
,
have
profess
the
most
passionate
regard
for
him
,
should
be
very
ready
to
impose
on
him
;
in
short
,
to
conceive
that
a
friend
should
,
of
his
own
accord
,
without
any
view
to
his
own
interest
,
endeavour
to
do
him
a
service
,
must
argue
such
weakness
of
mind
,
such
ignorance
of
the
world
,
and
such
an
artless
,
simple
,
undesigne
heart
,
as
must
render
the
person
possess
of
it
the
low
creature
and
the
proper
object
of
contempt
imaginable
,
in
the
eye
of
every
man
of
understanding
and
discernment
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
remember
that
his
friend
Heartfree
's
fault
be
rather
in
his
heart
than
in
his
head
;
that
,
though
he
be
so
mean
a
fellow
that
he
be
never
capable
of
lay
a
design
to
injure
any
human
creature
,
yet
be
he
by
no
mean
a
fool
,
nor
liable
to
any
gross
imposition
,
unless
where
his
heart
betray
him
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
instruct
the
count
to
take
only
one
of
his
jewel
at
the
first
interview
,
and
reject
the
rest
as
not
fine
enough
,
and
order
him
to
provide
some
rich
.
<EOS>
He
say
this
management
would
prevent
Heartfree
from
expect
ready
money
for
the
jewel
he
bring
with
him
,
which
the
count
be
presently
to
dispose
of
,
and
by
mean
of
that
money
,
and
his
great
ability
at
card
and
dice
,
to
get
together
as
large
a
sum
as
possible
,
which
he
be
to
pay
down
to
Heartfree
at
the
delivery
of
the
set
of
jewel
,
who
would
be
thus
void
of
all
manner
of
suspicion
and
would
not
fail
to
give
him
credit
for
the
residue
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
contrivance
,
it
will
appear
in
the
sequel
that
Wild
do
not
only
propose
to
make
the
imposition
on
Heartfree
,
who
be
(
hitherto
)
void
of
all
suspicion
,
more
certain
;
but
to
rob
the
count
himself
of
this
sum
.
<EOS>
this
double
method
of
cheat
the
very
tool
who
be
our
instrument
to
cheat
other
be
the
superlative
degree
of
greatness
,
and
be
probably
,
as
far
as
any
spirit
crust
over
with
clay
can
carry
it
,
fall
very
little
short
of
diabolism
itself
.
  
<EOS>
this
method
be
immediately
put
in
execution
,
and
the
count
the
first
day
take
only
a
single
brilliant
,
worth
about
three
hundred
pound
,
and
order
a
necklace
,
earring
,
and
solitaire
,
of
the
of
three
thousand
more
,
to
be
prepare
by
that
day
sevennight
.
  
<EOS>
the
interval
be
employ
by
Wild
in
prosecute
his
scheme
of
raise
a
gang
,
in
which
he
meet
with
such
success
,
that
within
a
few
day
he
have
levy
several
bold
and
resolute
fellow
,
fit
for
any
enterprize
,
how
dangerous
or
great
soever
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
before
remark
that
the
true
mark
of
greatness
be
insatiability
.
<EOS>
Wild
have
covenant
with
the
count
to
receive
three
-
fourth
of
the
booty
,
and
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
covenant
with
himself
to
secure
the
other
fourth
part
likewise
,
for
which
he
have
form
a
very
great
and
noble
design
;
but
he
now
see
with
concern
that
sum
which
be
to
be
receive
in
hand
by
Heartfree
in
danger
of
be
absolutely
lose
.
<EOS>
in
order
therefore
to
possess
himself
of
that
likewise
,
he
contrive
that
the
jewel
should
be
bring
in
the
afternoon
,
and
that
Heartfree
should
be
detain
before
the
count
could
see
him
;
so
that
the
night
should
overtake
him
in
his
return
,
when
two
of
his
gang
be
order
to
attack
and
plunder
him
.
   
<EOS>
contain
scene
of
SOFTNESS
,
LOVE
,
and
HONOUR
all
in
the
GREAT
stile
.
 
<EOS>
the
count
have
dispose
of
his
jewel
for
its
full
value
,
and
this
he
have
by
dexterity
raise
to
a
thousand
pound
;
this
sum
therefore
he
pay
down
to
Heartfree
,
promise
him
the
rest
within
a
month
.
<EOS>
His
house
,
his
equipage
,
his
appearance
,
but
,
above
all
,
a
certain
plausibility
in
his
voice
and
behaviour
would
have
deceive
any
,
but
one
whose
great
and
wise
heart
have
dictate
to
him
something
within
,
which
would
have
secure
him
from
any
danger
of
imposition
from
without
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
therefore
do
not
in
the
least
scruple
give
him
credit
;
but
,
as
he
have
in
reality
procure
those
jewel
of
another
,
his
own
little
stock
not
be
able
to
furnish
anything
so
valuable
,
he
beg
the
count
would
be
so
kind
to
give
his
note
for
the
money
,
payable
at
the
time
he
mention
;
which
that
gentleman
do
not
in
the
least
scruple
;
so
he
pay
him
the
thousand
pound
in
specie
,
and
give
his
note
for
two
thousand
eight
hundred
pound
more
to
Heartfree
,
who
burn
with
gratitude
to
Wild
for
the
noble
customer
he
have
recommend
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Heartfree
be
depart
,
Wild
,
who
wait
in
another
room
,
come
in
and
receive
the
casket
from
the
count
,
it
have
be
agree
between
them
that
this
should
be
deposit
in
his
hand
,
as
he
be
the
original
contriver
of
the
scheme
,
and
be
to
have
the
large
share
.
<EOS>
wild
,
have
receive
the
casket
,
offer
to
meet
the
count
late
that
evening
to
come
to
a
division
,
but
such
be
the
latter
's
confidence
in
the
honour
of
our
hero
,
that
he
say
,
if
it
be
any
inconvenience
to
him
,
the
next
morning
would
do
altogether
as
well
.
<EOS>
this
be
more
agreeable
to
Wild
,
and
accordingly
,
an
appointment
be
make
for
that
purpose
,
he
set
out
in
haste
to
pursue
Heartfree
to
the
place
where
the
two
gentleman
be
order
to
meet
and
attack
him
.
<EOS>
those
gentleman
with
noble
resolution
execute
their
purpose
;
they
attack
and
spoil
the
enemy
of
the
whole
sum
he
have
receive
from
the
count
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
engagement
be
over
,
and
Heartfree
leave
sprawl
on
the
ground
,
our
hero
,
who
wisely
decline
trust
the
booty
in
his
friend
'
hand
,
though
he
have
good
experience
of
their
honour
,
make
off
after
the
conqueror
:
at
length
,
they
be
all
at
a
place
of
safety
,
Wild
,
accord
to
a
previous
agreement
,
receive
nine
-
tenth
of
the
booty
:
the
subordinate
hero
do
indeed
profess
some
little
unwillingness
(
perhaps
more
than
be
strictly
consistent
with
honour
)
to
perform
their
contract
;
but
Wild
,
partly
by
argument
,
but
more
by
oath
and
threatening
,
prevail
with
them
to
fulfil
their
promise
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
have
thus
,
with
wonderful
address
,
bring
this
great
and
glorious
action
to
a
happy
conclusion
,
resolve
to
relax
his
mind
after
his
fatigue
,
in
the
conversation
of
the
fair
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
set
forwards
to
his
lovely
Laetitia
;
but
in
his
way
accidentally
meet
with
a
young
lady
of
his
acquaintance
,
Miss
Molly
Straddle
,
who
be
take
the
air
in
Bridges
-
street
.
<EOS>
Miss
Molly
,
see
Mr.
Wild
,
stop
him
,
and
with
a
familiarity
peculiar
to
a
genteel
town
education
,
tap
,
or
rather
slap
him
on
the
back
,
and
ask
him
to
treat
her
with
a
pint
of
wine
at
a
neighbour
tavern
.
<EOS>
the
hero
,
though
he
love
the
chaste
Laetitia
with
excessive
tenderness
,
be
not
of
that
low
sniveling
breed
of
mortal
who
,
as
it
be
generally
express
,
TYE
themselve
to
a
WOMANS
apron
-
STRINGS
;
in
a
word
,
who
be
taint
with
that
mean
,
base
,
low
vice
,
or
virtue
as
it
be
call
,
of
constancy
;
therefore
he
immediately
consent
,
and
attend
her
to
a
tavern
famous
for
excellent
wine
,
know
by
the
name
of
the
Rummer
and
Horseshoe
,
where
they
retire
to
a
room
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
Wild
be
very
vehement
in
his
address
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
the
young
lady
declare
she
would
grant
no
favour
till
he
have
make
her
a
present
;
this
be
immediately
comply
with
,
and
the
lover
make
as
happy
as
he
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
the
immoderate
fondness
which
Wild
entertain
for
his
dear
Laetitia
would
not
suffer
him
to
waste
any
considerable
time
with
Miss
Straddle
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
,
therefore
,
all
the
endearment
and
caress
of
that
young
lady
,
he
soon
make
an
excuse
to
go
down
stair
,
and
thence
immediately
set
forward
to
Laetitia
without
take
any
formal
leave
of
Miss
Straddle
,
or
indeed
of
the
drawer
,
with
whom
the
lady
be
afterwards
oblige
to
come
to
an
account
for
the
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
,
on
his
arrival
at
Mr.
Snap
's
,
find
only
Miss
Doshy
at
home
,
that
young
lady
be
employ
alone
,
in
imitation
of
Penelope
,
with
her
thread
or
worst
,
only
with
this
difference
,
that
whereas
Penelope
unravel
by
night
what
she
have
knit
or
wove
or
spin
by
day
,
so
what
our
young
heroine
unravel
by
day
she
knit
again
by
night
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
be
mend
a
pair
of
blue
stocking
with
red
clock
;
a
circumstance
which
perhaps
we
may
have
omit
,
have
it
not
serve
to
show
that
there
be
still
some
lady
of
this
age
who
imitate
the
simplicity
of
the
ancient
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
immediately
ask
for
his
beloved
,
and
be
inform
that
she
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
then
enquire
where
she
be
to
be
find
,
and
declare
he
would
not
depart
till
he
have
see
her
,
nay
not
till
he
have
marry
her
;
for
,
indeed
,
his
passion
for
her
be
truly
honourable
;
in
other
word
,
he
have
so
ungovernable
a
desire
for
her
person
,
that
he
would
go
any
length
to
satisfy
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
pull
out
the
casket
,
which
he
swear
be
full
of
the
fine
jewel
,
and
that
he
would
give
them
all
to
her
,
with
other
promise
,
which
so
prevail
on
Miss
Doshy
,
who
have
not
the
common
failure
of
sister
in
envying
,
and
often
endeavour
to
disappoint
,
each
other
's
happiness
,
that
she
desire
Mr.
Wild
to
sit
down
a
few
minute
,
whilst
she
endeavour
to
find
her
sister
and
to
bring
her
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
lover
thank
her
,
and
promise
to
stay
till
her
return
;
and
Miss
Doshy
,
leave
Mr.
Wild
to
his
meditation
,
fasten
him
in
the
kitchen
by
bar
the
door
(
for
most
of
the
door
in
this
mansion
be
make
to
be
bolt
on
the
outside
)
,
and
then
,
slap
to
the
door
of
the
house
with
great
violence
,
without
go
out
at
it
,
she
steal
softly
up
stair
where
Miss
Laetitia
be
engage
in
close
conference
with
Mr.
Bagshot
.
<EOS>
Miss
Letty
,
be
inform
by
her
sister
in
a
whisper
of
what
Mr.
Wild
have
say
,
and
what
he
have
produce
,
tell
Mr.
Bagshot
that
a
young
lady
be
below
to
visit
her
whom
she
would
despatch
with
all
imaginable
haste
and
return
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
desire
him
therefore
to
stay
with
patience
for
her
in
the
mean
time
,
and
that
she
would
leave
the
door
unlock
,
though
her
papa
would
never
forgive
her
if
he
should
discover
it
.
<EOS>
Bagshot
promise
on
his
honour
not
to
step
without
his
chamber
;
and
the
two
young
lady
go
softly
down
stair
,
when
,
pretend
first
to
make
their
entry
into
the
house
,
they
repair
to
the
kitchen
,
where
not
even
the
presence
of
the
chaste
Laetitia
could
restore
that
harmony
to
the
countenance
of
her
lover
which
Miss
Theodosia
have
leave
him
possess
of
;
for
,
during
her
absence
,
he
have
discover
the
absence
of
a
purse
contain
bank
-
note
for
900
pound
,
which
have
be
take
from
Mr.
Heartfree
,
and
which
,
indeed
,
Miss
Straddle
have
,
in
the
warmth
of
his
amorous
caress
,
unperceived
draw
from
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
have
that
perfect
mastery
of
his
temper
,
or
rather
of
his
muscle
,
which
be
as
necessary
to
the
form
a
great
character
as
to
the
personate
it
on
the
stage
,
he
soon
convey
a
smile
into
his
countenance
,
and
,
seal
as
well
his
misfortune
as
his
chagrin
at
it
,
begin
to
pay
honourable
address
to
Miss
Letty
.
<EOS>
this
young
lady
,
among
many
other
good
ingredient
have
three
very
predominant
passion
;
to
wit
,
vanity
,
wantonness
,
and
avarice
.
<EOS>
to
satisfy
the
first
of
these
she
employ
Mr.
Smirk
and
company
;
to
the
second
,
Mr.
Bagshot
and
company
;
and
our
hero
have
the
honour
and
happiness
of
solely
engross
the
third
.
<EOS>
now
,
these
three
sort
of
lover
she
have
very
different
way
of
entertain
.
<EOS>
with
the
first
she
be
all
gay
and
coquette
;
with
the
second
all
fond
and
rampant
;
and
with
the
last
all
cold
and
reserved
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
tell
Mr.
Wild
,
with
a
most
compose
aspect
,
that
she
be
glad
he
have
repent
of
his
manner
of
treat
her
at
their
last
interview
,
where
his
behaviour
be
so
monstrous
that
she
have
resolve
never
to
see
him
any
more
;
that
she
be
afraid
her
own
sex
would
hardly
pardon
her
the
weakness
she
be
guilty
of
in
recede
from
that
resolution
,
which
she
be
persuade
she
never
should
have
bring
herself
to
,
have
not
her
sister
,
who
be
there
to
confirm
what
she
say
(
as
she
do
with
many
oath
)
,
betray
her
into
his
company
,
by
pretend
it
be
another
person
to
visit
her
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
as
he
now
think
proper
to
give
her
more
convincing
proof
of
his
affection
(
for
he
have
now
the
casket
in
his
hand
)
,
and
since
she
perceive
his
design
be
no
longer
against
her
virtue
,
but
be
such
as
a
woman
of
honour
may
listen
to
,
she
must
own
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
feign
an
hesitation
,
when
Theodosia
begin
:
"
Nay
,
sister
,
I
be
resolve
you
shall
counterfeit
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Wild
,
she
hath
the
most
violent
passion
for
you
in
the
world
;
and
indeed
,
<EOS>
dear
<EOS>
Tishy
,
if
you
offer
to
go
back
,
since
I
plainly
see
Mr.
Wild
's
design
be
honourable
,
I
will
betray
all
you
have
ever
say
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
,
sister
!
"
answer
Laetitia
;
"
I
protest
you
will
drive
me
out
of
the
room
<EOS>
:
I
do
not
expect
this
usage
from
you
.
"
<EOS>
Wild
then
fall
on
his
knee
,
and
,
take
hold
of
her
hand
,
repeat
a
speech
,
which
,
as
the
reader
may
easily
suggest
it
to
himself
,
I
shall
not
here
set
down
.
<EOS>
He
then
offer
her
the
casket
,
but
she
gently
reject
it
;
and
on
a
second
offer
,
with
a
modest
countenance
and
voice
,
desire
to
know
what
it
contain
.
<EOS>
Wild
then
open
it
,
and
take
forth
(
with
sorrow
I
write
it
,
and
with
sorrow
will
it
be
read
)
one
of
those
beautiful
necklace
with
which
,
at
the
fair
of
Bartholomew
<EOS>
,
they
deck
the
well
-
bewhitene
neck
of
Thalestris
queen
of
Amazons
,
Anna
Bullen
,
queen
Elizabeth
,
or
some
other
high
princess
in
Drollic
story
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
compose
of
that
paste
which
Derdaeus
Magnus
,
an
ingenious
toy
-
man
,
doth
at
a
very
moderate
price
dispense
of
to
the
second
-
rate
beaus
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
for
,
to
open
a
truth
,
which
we
ask
our
reader
's
pardon
for
have
conceal
from
him
so
long
,
the
sagacious
count
,
wisely
fear
lest
some
accident
may
prevent
Mr.
Wild
's
return
at
the
appoint
time
,
have
carefully
convey
the
jewel
which
Mr.
Heartfree
have
bring
with
him
into
his
own
pocket
,
and
in
their
stead
have
place
in
the
casket
these
artificial
stone
,
which
,
though
of
equal
value
to
a
philosopher
,
and
perhaps
of
a
much
great
to
a
true
admirer
of
the
composition
of
art
,
have
not
however
the
same
charm
in
the
eye
of
Miss
Letty
,
who
have
indeed
some
knowledge
of
jewel
;
for
Mr.
Snap
,
with
great
reason
,
consider
how
valuable
a
part
of
a
lady
's
education
it
would
be
to
be
well
instruct
in
these
thing
,
in
an
age
when
young
lady
learn
little
more
than
how
to
dress
themselves
,
have
in
her
youth
place
Miss
Letty
as
the
handmaid
(
or
housemaid
as
the
vulgar
call
it
)
of
an
eminent
pawnbroker
.
<EOS>
the
lightning
,
therefore
,
which
should
have
flash
from
the
jewel
,
flash
from
her
eye
,
and
thunder
immediately
follow
from
her
voice
.
<EOS>
She
be
-
knaved
,
be
-
rascalle
,
be
-
rogue
the
unhappy
hero
,
who
stand
silent
,
confound
with
astonishment
,
but
more
with
shame
and
indignation
,
at
be
thus
outwit
and
overreach
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
recover
his
spirit
,
and
,
throw
down
the
casket
in
a
rage
,
he
snatch
the
key
from
the
table
,
and
,
without
make
any
answer
to
the
lady
,
who
both
very
plentifully
open
upon
him
,
and
without
take
any
leave
of
them
,
he
fly
out
at
the
door
,
and
repair
with
the
utmost
expedition
to
the
count
's
habitation
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
WILD
,
after
many
FRUITLESS
ENDEAVOURS
to
discover
his
friend
,
moralise
on
his
MISFORTUNE
in
a
SPEECH
,
which
MAY
be
of
use
<EOS>
(
if
RIGHTLY
understand
)
<EOS>
to
some
other
considerable
SPEECH
-
MAKERS
.
<EOS>
not
the
highest
-
fed
footman
of
the
highest

breed
woman
of
quality
knock
with
more
impetuosity
than
Wild
do
at
the
count
's
door
,
which
be
immediately
open
by
a
well
-
dr
liveryman
,
who
answer
that
his
master
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
wild
,
not
satisfied
with
this
,
search
the
house
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
he
then
ransack
all
the
gaming
-
house
in
town
,
but
find
no
count
:
indeed
,
that
gentleman
have
take
leave
of
his
house
<EOS>
the
same
instant
Mr.
Wild
have
turn
his
back
,
and
,
equip
himself
with
boot
and
a
post
-
horse
,
without
take
with
him
either
servant
,
clothe
,
or
any
necessary
for
the
journey
of
a
great
man
,
make
such
mighty
expedition
that
he
be
now
upwards
of
twenty
mile
on
his
way
to
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
,
find
his
search
ineffectual
,
resolve
to
give
it
over
for
that
night
;
he
then
retire
to
his
seat
of
contemplation
,
a
night
-
cellar
,
where
,
without
a
single
farthing
in
his
pocket
,
he
call
for
a
sneaker
of
punch
,
and
,
place
himself
on
a
bench
by
himself
,
he
softly
vent
the
follow
soliloquy
:
    
<EOS>
"
how
vain
be
human
GREATNESS
!
<EOS>
what
avail
superior
ability
,
and
a
noble
defiance
of
those
narrow
rule
and
bound
which
confine
the
vulgar
,
when
his
best
-
concert
scheme
be
liable
to
be
defeat
!
<EOS>
how
unhappy
be
the
state
of
PRIGGISM
!
<EOS>
how
impossible
for
human
prudence
to
foresee
and
guard
against
every
circumvention
!
<EOS>
It
be
even
as
a
game
of
chess
,
where
,
while
the
rook
,
or
knight
,
or
bishop
,
be
busy
forecast
some
great
enterprize
,
a
worthless
pawn
expose
and
disconcert
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
well
have
it
be
for
me
to
have
observe
the
simple
law
of
friendship
and
morality
than
thus
to
ruin
my
friend
for
the
benefit
of
other
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
command
his
purse
to
any
degree
of
moderation
:
I
have
now
disable
him
from
the
power
of
serve
me
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
my
design
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
not
arraign
my
own
conduct
,
why
should
I
,
like
a
woman
or
a
child
,
sit
down
and
lament
the
disappointment
of
chance
?
<EOS>
but
can
I
acquit
myself
of
all
neglect
?
<EOS>
do
I
not
misbehave
in
put
it
into
the
power
of
other
to
outwit
me
?
<EOS>
but
that
be
impossible
to
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
in
this
a
prig
be
more
unhappy
than
any
other
:
a
cautious
man
may
,
in
a
crowd
,
preserve
his
own
pocket
by
keep
his
hand
in
them
;
but
while
the
prig
employ
his
hand
in
another
's
pocket
,
how
shall
he
be
able
to
defend
his
own
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
this
light
,
what
can
be
imagine
more
miserable
than
a
prig
?
<EOS>
how
dangerous
be
his
acquisition
!
<EOS>
how
unsafe
,
how
unquiet
his
possession
!
<EOS>
why
then
should
any
man
wish
to
be
a
prig
,
or
where
be
his
greatness
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
in
his
mind
:
'
tis
the
inward
glory
,
<EOS>
the
secret
consciousness
of
do
great
and
wonderful
action
,
which
can
alone
support
the
truly
great
man
,
whether
he
be
a
CONQUEROR
,
a
tyrant
,
a
STATESMAN
,
or
a
prig
.
<EOS>
these
must
bear
him
up
against
the
private
curse
and
public
imprecation
,
and
,
while
he
be
hate
and
detest
by
all
mankind
,
must
make
him
inwardly
satisfied
with
himself
.
<EOS>
for
what
but
some
such
inward
satisfaction
as
this
could
inspire
man
possess
of
power
,
wealth
,
of
every
human
blessing
which
pride
,
avarice
,
or
luxury
could
desire
,
to
forsake
their
home
,
abandon
ease
and
repose
,
and
at
the
expense
of
rich

the

at
the

of
all
that

could
send
them
at
the

of
a
multitude
of
prigs
,
call
an
army
,
to
molest
their
neighbour
;
to
introduce
rape

rapine
,
bloodshed
,
and
every
kind
of
misery
among
their
own
specie
?
<EOS>
what
but
some
such
glorious
appetite
of
mind
could
inflame
prince
,
endow
with
the
great
honour
,
and
enrich
with
the
most
plentiful
revenue
,
to
desire
maliciously
to
rob
those
subject
of
their
liberty
who
be
content
to
sweat
for
the
luxury
,
and
to
bow
down
their
knee
to
the
pride
,
of
those
very
prince
?
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
but
this
can
inspire
them
to
destroy
one
half
of
their
subject
,
in
order
to
reduce
the
rest
to
an
absolute
dependence
on
their
own
will
,
and
on
those
of
their
brutal
successor

<EOS>
what
other
motive
could
seduce
a
subject
,
possess
of
great
property
in
his
community
,
to
betray
the
interest
of
his
fellow

subject
,
of
his
brother

his

to
the
wanton
disposition
of
such
prince
?
<EOS>
lastly
,
what
less
inducement
could
persuade
the
prig
to
forsake
the
method
of
acquire
a
safe
,
an
honest
,
and
a
plentiful
livelihood
,
and
,
at
the
hazard
of
even
life
itself
,
and
what
be
mistaken
call
dishonour
,
to
break
openly
and
bravely
through
the
law
of
his
country
,
for
uncertain
,
unsteady
,
and
unsafe
gain
?
<EOS>
let
me
then
hold
myself
contented
with
this
reflection
,
that
I
have
be
wise
though
unsuccessful
,
and
be
a
cheat
though
an
unhappy
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
soliloquy
and
his
punch
conclude
together
;
for
he
have
at
every
pause
comfort
himself
with
a
sip
.
<EOS>
and
now
it
come
first
into
his
head
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
pay
for
it
than
it
be
to
swallow
it
;
when
,
to
his
great
pleasure
,
he
behold
at
another
corner
of
the
room
one
of
the
gentleman
whom
he
have
employ
in
the
attack
on
Heartfree
,
and
who
,
he
doubt
not
,
would
readily
lend
him
a
guinea
or
two
;
but
he
have
the
mortification
,
on
apply
to
him
,
to
hear
that
the
gaming
-
table
have
stript
him
of
all
the
booty
which
his
own
generosity
have
leave
in
his
possession
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
oblige
to
pursue
his
usual
method
on
such
occasion
:
<EOS>
so
,
cock
his
hat
fiercely
,
he
march
out
of
the
room
without
make
any
excuse
,
or
any
one
dare
to
make
the
least
demand
.
   
<EOS>
contain
many
surprising
adventures
,
which
<EOS>
our
hero
,
with
GREAT
GREATNESS
,
ACHIEVED
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
now
leave
our
hero
to
take
a
short
repose
,
and
return
to
Mr.
Snaps
'
where
,
at
Wild
's
departure
,
the
fair
Theodosia
have
again
betake
herself
to
her
stocking
,
and
Miss
Letty
have
retire
up
stair
to
Mr.
Bagshot
;
but
that
gentleman
have
break
his
parole
,
and
,
have
convey
himself
below
stair
behind
a
door
,
he
take
the
opportunity
of
Wild
's
sally
to
make
his
escape
.
<EOS>
We
shall
only
observe
that
Miss
Letty
's
surprize
be
the
great
,
as
she
have
,
notwithstanding
her
promise
to
the
contrary
,
take
the
precaution
to
turn
the
key
;
but
,
in
her
hurry
,
she
do
it
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
how
wretched
must
have
be
the
situation
of
this
young
creature
,
who
have
not
only
lose
a
lover
on
whom
her
tender
heart
perfectly
doate
,
but
be
expose
to
the
rage
of
an
injured
father
,
tenderly
jealous
of
his
honour
,
which
be
deeply
engage
to
the
sheriff
of
London
and
Middlesex
for
the
safe
custody
of
the
say
Bagshot
,
and
for
which
two
very
good
responsible
friend
have
give
not
only
their
word
but
their
bond
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
us
remove
our
eye
from
this
melancholy
object
and
survey
our
hero
,
who
,
after
a
successless
search
for
Miss
Straddle
,
with
wonderful
greatness
of
mind
and
steadiness
of
countenance
go
early
in
the
morning
to
visit
his
friend
Heartfree
,
at
a
time
when
the
common
herd
of
friend
would
have
forsake
and
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
He
enter
the
room
with
a
chearful
air
,
which
he
presently
change
into
surprize
on
see
his
friend
in
a
night
-
gown
,
with
his
wounded
head
bind
about
with
linen
,
and
look
extremely
pale
from
a
great
effusion
of
blood
.
<EOS>
when
Wild
be
inform
by
Heartfree
what
have
happen
he
first
express
great
sorrow
,
and
afterwards
suffer
as
violent
agony
of
rage
against
the
robber
to
burst
from
him
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
in
compassion
to
the
deep
impression
his
misfortune
seem
to
make
on
his
friend
,
endeavour
to
lessen
it
as
much
as
possible
,
at
the
same
time
exaggerate
the
obligation
he
owe
to
Wild
,
in
which
his
wife
likewise
second
him
,
and
they
breakfast
with
more
comfort
than
be
reasonably
to
be
expect
after
such
an
accident
;
Heartfree
express
great
satisfaction
that
he
have
put
the
count
's
note
in
another
pocket
-
book
;
adding
,
that
such
a
loss
would
have
be
fatal
to
him
;
"
for
,
to
confess
the
truth
to
you
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
have
some
loss
lately
which
have
greatly
perplex
my
affair
;
and
though
I
have
many
debt
due
to
me
from
people
of
great
fashion
,
I
assure
you
<EOS>
I
know
not
where
to
be
certain
of
get
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wild
greatly
felicitate
him
on
the
lucky
accident
of
preserve
his
note
,
and
then
proceed
,
with
much
acrimony
,
to
inveigh
against
the
barbarity
of
people
of
fashion
,
who
keep
tradesman
out
of
their
money
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
amuse
themselves
with
discourse
of
this
kind
,
wild
meditating
within
himself
whether
he
should
borrow
or
steal
from
his
friend
,
or
indeed
whether
he
could
not
effect
both
,
the
apprentice
bring
a
bank
-
note
of
L500
in
to
Heartfree
,
which
he
say
a
gentlewoman
in
the
shop
,
who
have
be
look
at
some
jewel
,
desire
him
to
exchange
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
look
at
the
number
,
immediately
recollect
it
to
be
one
of
those
he
have
be
rob
of
.
<EOS>
with
this
discovery
he
acquaint
Wild
,
who
,
with
the
notable
presence
of
mind
and
unchanged
complexion
so
essential
to
a
great
character
,
advise
him
to
proceed
cautiously
;
and
offer
(
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Heartfree
himself
be
,
he
say
,
too
much
fluster
to
examine
the
woman
with
sufficient
art
)
to
take
her
into
a
room
in
his
house
alone
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
he
say
,
personate
the
master
of
the
shop
,
would
pretend
to
shew
her
some
jewel
,
and
would
undertake
to
get
sufficient
information
out
of
her
to
secure
the
rogue
,
and
most
probably
all
their
booty
.
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
readily
and
thankfully
accept
by
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
Wild
go
immediately
up
stair
into
the
room
appoint
,
whither
the
apprentice
,
accord
to
appointment
,
conduct
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
the
apprentice
be
order
down
stair
the
moment
the
lady
enter
the
room
;
and
Wild
,
have
shut
the
door
,
approach
her
with
great
ferocity
in
his
look
,
and
begin
to
expatiate
on
the
complicated
baseness
of
the
crime
she
have
be
guilty
of
;
but
though
he
utter
many
good
lesson
of
morality
,
as
we
doubt
whether
from
a
particular
reason
they
may
work
any
very
good
effect
on
our
reader
,
we
shall
omit
his
speech
,
and
only
mention
his
conclusion
,
which
be
by
ask
her
what
mercy
she
could
now
expect
from
him
?
<EOS>
Miss
Straddle
,
for
that
be
the
young
lady
,
who
have
have
a
good
education
,
and
have
be
more
than
once
present
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
very
confidently
deny
the
whole
charge
,
and
say
she
have
receive
the
note
from
a
friend
.
<EOS>
wild
then
,
raise
his
voice
,
tell
her
she
should
be
immediately
commit
,
and
she
may
depend
on
be
convict
;
"
but
,
"
add
he
,
change
his
tone
,
"
as
I
have
a
violent
affection
for
thee
,
my
dear
Straddle
,
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
,
I
promise
you
,
on
my
honour
,
to
forgive
you
,
nor
shall
you
be
ever
call
in
question
on
this
account
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
,
Mr.
Wild
?
<EOS>
"
reply
the
young
lady
,
with
a
pleasanter
aspect
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
then
,
"
say
Wild
,
"
the
money
you
pick
out
of
my
pocket
(
nay
,
by
G####d
you
do
,
and
if
you
offer
to
flinch
you
shall
be
convict
of
it
)
<EOS>
I
win
at
play
of
a
fellow
who
it
seem
rob
my
friend
of
it
;
you
must
,
therefore
,
give
an
information
on
oath
against
one
Thomas
Fierce
,
and
say
that
you
receive
the
note
from
him
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
certain
,
Molly
,
you
must
be
sensible
of
your
obligation
to
me
,
who
return
good
for
evil
to
you
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
"
the
lady
readily
consent
,
and
advance
to
embrace
Mr.
Wild
,
who
step
a
little
back
and
cry
,
"
hold
,
Molly
;
there
be
two
other
note
of
L200
each
to
be
account
for

"
<EOS>
the
lady
protest
with
the
most
solemn
asseveration
that
she
know
of
no
more
;
with
which
,
when
Wild
be
not
satisfied
,
she
cry
,
"
I
will
stand
search
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
you
shall

"
answer
Wild
,
"
and
stand
strip
too
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
tumble
and
search
her
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
till
at
last
she
burst
into
tear
,
and
declare
she
would
tell
the
truth
(
as
indeed
she
do
)
<EOS>
;
she
then
confess
that
she
have
dispose

of
a
regiment
of
dragoon
,
and

and
,
as
for
the
other
,
she
have
lay
it
all
out
that
very
morning
in
brocaded
silk
and
flander
lace
.
<EOS>
with
this
account
Wild
,
who
indeed
know
it
to
be
a
very
probable
one
,
be
force
to
be
content
:
and
now
,
abandon
all
further
thought
of
what
he
see
be
irretrievably
lose
,
he
give
the
lady
some
further
instruction
,
and
then
,
desire
her
to
stay
a
few
minute
behind
him
,
he
return
to
his
friend
,
and
acquaint
him
that

whole
roguery
;
that
the
woman

note
,
and

add
,
he

concern
he
could
not
attend
him
thither
,
be
oblige
to
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
to
receive
thirty
pound
,
which
he
be
to
pay
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
say
that
should
not
prevent
him
of
his
company
,
for
he
could
easily
lend
him
such
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
this
be
accordingly
do
and
accept
,
and
Wild
,
Heartfree
,
and
the
lady
go
to
the
justice
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
warrant
be
grant
,
and
the
constable
be
acquaint
by
the
lady
,
who
receive
her
information
from
Wild
,
of
Mr.
Fierce
's
haunt
,
he
be
easily
apprehend
,
and
,
be
confront
by
Miss
Straddle
,
who
swear
positively
to
him
,
though
she
have
never
see
him
before
,
he
be
commit
to
Newgate
,
where
he
immediately
convey
an
information
to
Wild
of
what
have
happen
,
and
in
the
evening
receive
a
visit
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
affect
great
concern
for
his
friend
's
misfortune
,
and
as
great
surprize
at
the
mean
by
which
it
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
tell
Fierce
that
he
must
certainly
be
mistake
in
that
point
of
his
have
have
no
acquaintance
with
Miss
Straddle
:
but
add
,
that
he
would
find
her
out
,
and
endeavour
to
take
off
her
evidence
,
which
,
he
observe
,
do
not
come
home
enough
to
endanger
him
;
besides
,
be
would
secure
him
witness
of
an
alibi
,
and
five
or
six
to
his
character
;
so
that
he
nee
be
under
no
apprehension
,
for
his
confinement
till
the
session
would
be
his
only
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
Fierce
,
who
be
greatly
comfort
by
these
assurance
of
his
friend
,
return
him
many
thank
,
and
,
both
shake
each
other
very
earnestly
by
the
hand
,
with
a
very
hearty
embrace
they
separate
.
  
<EOS>
the
hero
consider
with
himself
that
the
single
evidence
of
Miss
Straddle
would
not
be
sufficient
to
convince
Fierce
,
whom
he
resolve
to
hang
,
as
he
be
the
person
who
have
principally
refuse
to
deliver
him
the
stipulate
share
of
the
booty
;
he
therefore
go
in
quest
of
Mr.
James
Sly
,
the
gentleman
who
have
assist
in
the
exploit
,
and
find
and
acquaint
him
with
the
apprehending
of
Fierce
.
<EOS>
Wild
then
,
intimate
his
fear
least
Fierce
should
impeach
Sly
,
advise
him
to
be
beforehand
,
to
surrender
himself
to
a
justice
of
peace
and
offer
himself
as
an
evidence
.
<EOS>
Sly
approve
Mr.
Wild
's
opinion
,
go
directly
to
a
magistrate
,
and
be
by
him
commit
to
the
Gatehouse
,
with
a
promise
of
be
admit
evidence
against
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
Fierce
be
in
a
few
day
bring
to
his
trial
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
where
,
to
his
great
confusion
,
his
old
friend
Sly
appear
against
him
,
as
do
Miss
Straddle
.
<EOS>
His
only
hope
be
now
in
the
assistance
which
our
hero
have
promise
him
.
<EOS>
these
unhappily
fail
him
:
so
that
,
the
evidence
be
plain
against
him
,
and
he
make
no
defence
,
the
jury
convict
him
,
the
court
condemn
him
,
and
Mr.
Ketch
execute
him
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
infinite
address
do
this
truly
great
man
know
how
to
play
with
the
passion
of
man
,
to
set
them
at
variance
with
each
other
,
and
to
work
his
own
purpose
out
of
those
jealousy
and
apprehension
which
he
be
wonderfully
ready
at
create
by
mean
of
those
great
art
which
the
vulgar
call
treachery
,
dissemble
,
promise
,
lying
,
falsehood
,
&
c.
,
but
which
be
by
great
man
sum
up
in
the
collective
name
of
policy
,
or
politic
,
or
rather
pollitric
;
an
art
of
which
,
as
it
be
the
high
excellence
of
human
nature
,
perhaps
our
great
man
be
the
most
eminent
master

<EOS>
of

<EOS>
Wild
have
now
get
together
a
very
considerable
gang
,
compose
of
undone
gamester
,
ruin
bailiff
,
break
tradesman
,
idle
apprentice
,
attorney
'
clerk
,
and
loose
and
disorderly
youth

no

,
nor
breed
to
any
trade
or
profession
,
be
willing
to
live
luxuriously
without
labour
.
<EOS>
as
these
person
wear
different
PRINCIPLES
,
i.e.
HATS
,
frequent
dissension
grow
among
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
particularly
two
party
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
those
who
wear
hat
FIERCELY
cock
,
and
those
who
prefer
the
NAB
or
trencher
hat
,
with
the
brim
flap
over
their
eye
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
call
CAVALIERS
and
TORY
RORY
RANTER
BOYS
,
&
c.
;
the
latter
go
by
the
several
name
of
WAGS
,
roundhead
,
shakebag
,
old
-
noll
,
and
several
other
.
<EOS>
between
these
,
continual
jar
arise
,
insomuch
that
they
grow
in
time
to
think
there
be
something
essential
in
their
difference
,
and
that
their
interest
be
incompatible
with
each
other
,
whereas
,
in
truth
,
the
difference
lie
only
in
the
fashion
of
their
hat
.
<EOS>
wild
,
therefore
,
have
assemble
them
all
at
an
alehouse
on
the
night
after
Fierce
's
execution
,
and
,
perceive
evident
mark
of
their
misunderstanding
,
from
their
behaviour
to
each
other
,
address
them
in
the
follow
gentle
,
but
forcible
manner
:
<EOS>
[
footnote
:
there
be
something
very
mysterious
in
this
speech
,
which
probably
that
chapter
write
by
Aristotle
on
this
subject
,
which
be
mention
by
a
french
author
,
may
have
give
some
light
into
;
but
that
be
unhappily
among
the
lost
work
of
that
philosopher
.
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
galerus
,
which
be
latin
for
a
hat
,
signify
likewise
a
dog
-
fish
,
as
the
greek
word
kuneae
doth
the
skin
of
that
animal
;
of
which
I
suppose
the
hat
or
helmet
of
the
ancient
be
compose
,
as
our
at
present
be
of
the
beaver
or
rabbit
.
<EOS>
sophocle
,
in
the
latter
end
of
his
Ajax
,
allude
to
a
method
of
cheat
in
hat
,
and
the
scholiast
on
the
place
tell
us
of
one
Crephontes
,
who
be
a
master
of
the
art
.
<EOS>
It
be
observable
likewise
that
Achilles
,
in
the
first
Iliad
of
Homer
,
tell
Agamemnon
,
in
anger
,
that
he
have
dog
's
eye
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
the
eye
of
a
dog
be
handsome
than
those
of
almost
any
other
animal
,
this
could
be
no
term
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
must
therefore
mean
that
he
have
a
hat
on
,
which
,
perhaps
,
from
the
creature
it
be
make
of
,
or
from
some
other
reason
,
may
have
be
a
mark
of
infamy
.
<EOS>
this
superstitious
opinion
may
account
for
that
custom
,
which
hath
descend
through
all
nation
,
of
shew
respect
by
pull
off
this
covering
,
and
that
no
man
be
esteem
fit
to
converse
with
his
superior
with
it
on
.
<EOS>
I
shall
conclude
this
learned
note
with
remark
that
the
term
old
hat
be
at
present
use
by
the
vulgar
in
no
very
honourable
sense
.

<EOS>
"
gentleman
,
I
be
ashamed
to
see
man
embark
in
<EOS>
so
great
and
glorious
an
undertaking
,
as
that
of
rob
the
public
,
so
foolishly
and
weakly
dissent
among
themselves
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
the
first
inventor
of
hat
,
or
at
least
of
the
distinction
between
them
,
really
conceive
that
one
form
of
hat
should
inspire
a
man
with
divinity
,
another
with
law
,
another
with
learning
,
or
another
with
bravery
?
<EOS>
no
,
they
mean
no
more
by
these
outward
sign
than
to
impose
on
the
vulgar
,
and
,
instead
of
put
great
man
to
the
trouble
of
acquire
or
maintain
the
substance
,
to
make
it
sufficient
that
they
condescend
to
wear
the
type
or
shadow
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
do
wisely
,
therefore
,
when
in
a
crowd
,
to
amuse
the
mob
by
quarrel
on
such
account
,
that
while
they
be
listen
to
your
jargon
you
may
with
the
great
ease
and
safety
pick
their
pocket
:
but
surely
to
be
in
earnest
,
and
privately
to
keep
up
such
a
ridiculous
contention
among
yourself
,
must
argue
the
high
folly
and
absurdity
.
<EOS>
when
you
know
you
be
all
prigs
,
what
difference
can
a
broad
or
a
narrow
brim
create
?
<EOS>
be
a
prig
less
a
prig
in
one
hat
than
in
another
?
<EOS>
if
the
public
should
be
weak
enough
to
interest
themselves
in
your
quarrel
,
and
to
prefer
one
pack
to
the
other
,
while
both
be
aim
at
their
purse
,
it
be
your
business
to
laugh
at
,
not
imitate
their
folly
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
more
ridiculous
than
for
gentleman
to
quarrel
about
hat
,
when
there
be
not
one
among
you
whose
hat
be
worth
a
farthing
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
a
hat
farther
than
to
keep
the
head
warm
,
or
to
hide
a
bald
crown
from
the
public
?
<EOS>
It
be
the
mark
of
a
gentleman
to
move
his
hat
on
every
occasion
;
and
in
court
and
noble
assembly
<EOS>
no
man
ever
wear
one
.
<EOS>
let
me
hear
no
more
therefore
of
this
childish
disagreement
,
but
all
toss
up
your
hat
together
with
one
accord
,
and
consider
that
hat
as
the
good
,
which
will
contain
the
large
booty
.
"
<EOS>
He
thus
end
his
speech
,
which
be
follow
by
a
murmuring
applause
,
and
immediately
all
present
toss
their
hat
together
as
he
have
command
them
.
   
<EOS>
shew
the
CONSEQUENCE
which
ATTENDED
heartfree
be
adventures
with
WILD
;
<EOS>
all
natural
and
common
enough
<EOS>
to
little
wretches
who
DEAL
with
great
man
;
together
with
some
precedent
of
letter
,
be
the
different
methods
of
ANSWERING
a
DUN
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
now
return
to
Heartfree
,
to
whom
the
count
's
note
,
which
he
have
pay
away
,
be
return
,
with
an
account
that
the
drawer
be
not
to
be
find
,
and
that
,
on
enquire
after
him
,
they
have
hear
he
have
run
away
,
and
consequently
the
money
be
now
demand
of
the
endorser
.
<EOS>
the
apprehension
of
such
a
loss
would
have
affect
any
man
of
business
,
but
much
more
one
whose
unavoidable
ruin
it
must
prove
.
<EOS>
He
express
so
much
concern
and
confusion
on
this
occasion
,
that
the
proprietor
of
the
note
be
frightened
,
and
resolve
to
lose
no
time
in
secure
what
he
could
.
<EOS>
so
that
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
Mr.
Snap
be
commission
to
pay
Heartfree
a
visit
,
which
he
do
with
his
usual
formality
,
and
convey
him
to
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
be
no
sooner
informed
of
what
have
happen
to
her
husband
than
she
rave
like
one
distract
;
but
after
she
have
vent
the
first
agony
of
her
passion
in
tear
and
lamentation
she
apply
herself
to
all
possible
mean
to
procure
her
husband
's
liberty
.
<EOS>
She
hasten
to
beg
her
neighbour
to
secure
bail
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
news
have
arrive
at
their
house
before
her
,
she
find
none
of
them
at
home
,
except
an
honest
Quaker
,
whose
servant
durst
not
tell
a
lie
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
succeed
no
better
with
him
,
for
unluckily
he
have
make
an
affirmation
the
day
before
that
he
would
never
be
bail
for
any
man
.
<EOS>
after
many
fruitless
effort
of
this
kind
she
repair
to
her
husband
,
to
comfort
him
at
least
with
her
presence
.
<EOS>
She
find
him
seal
the
last
of
several
letter
,
which
he
be
despatch
to
his
friend
and
creditor
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
see
her
a
sudden
joy
sparkle
in
his
eye
,
which
,
however
,
have
a
very
short
duration
;
for
despair
soon
close
them
again
;
nor
could
he
help
burst
into
some
passionate
expression
of
concern
for
her
and
his
little
family
,
which
she
,
on
her
part
,
do
her
utmost
to
lessen
,
by
endeavour
to
mitigate
the
loss
,
and
to
raise
in
him
hope
from
the
count
,
who
may
,
she
say
,
be
possibly
only
go
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
She
comfort
him
likewise
with
the
expectation
of
favour
from
his
acquaintance
,
especially
from
those
whom
he
have
in
a
particular
manner
oblige
and
serve
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
she
conjure
him
,
by
all
the
value
and
esteem
he
profess
for
her
,
not
to
endanger
his
health
,
on
which
alone
depend
her
happiness
,
by
too
great
an
indulgence
of
grief
;
assure
him
that
no
state
of
life
could
appear
unhappy
to
her
with
him
,
unless
his
own
sorrow
or
discontent
make
it
so
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
do
this
weak
poor
-
spirited
woman
attempt
to
relieve
her
husband
's
pain
,
which
it
would
have
rather
become
her
to
aggravate
,
by
not
only
paint
out
his
misery
in
the
lively
colour
imaginable
,
but
by
upbraid
him
with
that
folly
and
confidence
which
have
occasion
it
,
and
by
lament
her
own
hard
fate
in
be
oblige
to
share
his
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
Heartfree
return
this
goodness
(
as
it
be
call
)
of
his
wife
with
the
warm
gratitude
,
and
they
pass
an
hour
in
a
scene
of
tenderness
too
low
and
contemptible
to
be
recount
to
our
great
reader
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
omit
all
such
relation
,
as
they
tend
only
to
make
human
nature
low
and
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
those
messenger
who
have
obtain
any
answer
to
his
letter
now
return
.
<EOS>
We
shall
here
copy
a
few
of
them
,
as
they
may
serve
for
precedent
to
other
who
have
an
occasion

which
happen
commonly
enough
in

to

of

let

therefore
,
as
fast

this
detestable

present
the
much
more
agreeable
portrait
of

assurance
to

the

very
properly

the

<EOS>
Heartfree
have
scarce
do
read
his

our

appear

not
with
that
aspect
with
which
a
pitiful
parson
meet
his
patron
after
have
oppose
him
at

election

or
which
a

wear
when
sneak
away
from

when

death

not

who
,
after
a
strong
conflict
between
virtue
and
vice
,
hath
surrender
his
mind
to
the
latter
,
and
be
discover
in
his
first
treachery
;
but
with
that
noble

bold
,
great
confidence
with
which
a
prime
minister
assure
his
dependent
that
the
place
he
promise

such
concern

as
he
express
in
his
look
on
those
occasion
do
Wild
testify
on
the
first
meeting
of
his

and
as
the

prime

chide
you
for
neglect
of
your

so
do
our

attack
Heartfree
for
his
give
credit

without

proceed

with
abuse

,
like
an
invade
prince
,
when
attack
in
his
own
dominion
,
force
to
recal
his
whole
strength
to
defend
himself
at
home
.
<EOS>
this
indeed
he
do
so
well
,
by
insist
on
the
figure
and
outward
appearance
of
the
count
and
his
equipage
,
that
Wild
at
length
grow
a
little
more
gentle
,
and
with
a
sigh
say
,
"
I
confess
I
have
the
least
reason
of
all
mankind
to
censure
another
for
an
imprudence
of
this
nature
,
as
I
be
myself
the
most
easy
to
be
impose
upon
,
and
indeed
have
be
so
by
this
count
,
who
,
if
he
be
insolvent
,
hath
cheat
me
of
five
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
my
own
part
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
not
yet
despair
,
nor
would
I
have
you
.
<EOS>
many
man
have
find
it
convenient
to
retire
or
abscond
for
a
while
,
and
afterwards
have
pay
their
debt
,
or
at
least
handsomely
compound
them
.
<EOS>
this
I
be
certain
of
,
should
a
composition
take
place
,
which
be
the
bad
I
think
that
can
be
apprehend
,
I
shall
be
the
only
loser
;
for
I
shall
think
myself
oblige
in
honour
to
repair
your
loss
,
even
though
you
must
confess
it
be
principally
owe
to
your
own
folly
.
<EOS>
z
 
ds
!
<EOS>
have
I
imagine
it
necessary
,
I
would
have
caution
you
,
but
I
think
the
part
of
the
town
where
he
live
sufficient
caution
not
to
trust
him
.
<EOS>
and
such
a
sum
!
 
<EOS>
the
devil
must
have
be
in
you
certainly
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
degree
of
impudence
beyond
poor
Mrs.
Heartfree
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
though
she
have
before
vent
the
most
violent
execration
on
Wild
,
she
be
now
thoroughly
satisfied
of
his
innocence
,
and
beg
him
not
to
insist
any
longer
on
what
he
perceive
so
deeply
affect
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
say
trade
could
not
be
carry
on
without
credit
,
and
surely
he
be
sufficiently
justify
in
give
it
to
such
a
person
as
the
count
appear
to
be
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
say
,
reflection
on
what
be
past
and
irretrievable
would
be
of
little
service
;
that
their
present
business
be
to
consider
how
to
prevent
the
evil
consequence
which
threaten
,
and
first
to
endeavour
to
procure
her
husband
his
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
doth
he
not
procure
bail
?
"
say
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
we
have
apply
to
many
of
our
acquaintance
in
vain
;
we
have
meet
with
excuse
even
where
we
could
least
expect
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
bail
!
"
<EOS>
answer
Wild
,
in
a
passion
;
<EOS>
"
he
shall
have
bail
,
if
there
be
any
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
very
late
,
but
trust
me
to
procure
him
bail
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
receive
these
profession
with
tear
,
and
tell
Wild
he
be
a
friend
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
then
propose
to
stay
that
evening
with
her
husband
,
but
he
would
not
permit
her
on
account
of
his
little
family
,
whom
he
would
not
agree
to
trust
to
the
care
of
servant
in
this
time
of
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
a
hackney
-
coach
be
then
send
for
,
but
without
success
;
for
these
,
like
hackney

friend
,
always
offer
themselves
in
the
sunshine
,
but
be
never
to
be
find
when
you
want
them

<EOS>
and
as
for
a

,
Mr.
Snap
live
in
a
part
of
the
town
which
chairmen
very
little
frequent
.
<EOS>
the

be
therefore
oblige
to
walk
home
,
whither
the
gallant
Wild
offer
to
attend
her
as
a
protector
.
<EOS>
this
favour
be
thankfully
accept
,
and
,
the
husband
and
wife
have
take
a
tender
leave
of
each
other
,
the
former
be
lock
in
and
the
latter
lock
out
by
the
hand
of
Mr.
Snap
himself
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
visit
of
Mr.
Wild
's
to
Heartfree
may
seem
one
of
those
passage
in
history
which
writer
,
Drawcansir
-
like
,
introduce
only
because
they
dare
;
indeed
,
as
it
may
seem
somewhat
contradictory
to
the
greatness
of
our
hero
,
and
may
tend
to
blemish
his
character
with
an
imputation
of
that
kind
of
friendship
which
savour
too
much
of
weakness
and
imprudence
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
account
for
this
visit
,
especially
to
our
more
sagacious
reader
,
whose
satisfaction
we
shall
always
consult
in
the
most
especial
manner
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
know
then
that
at
the
first
interview
with
Mrs.
Heartfree
Mr.
Wild
have
conceive
that
passion
,
or
affection
,
or
friendship
,
or
desire
,
for
that
handsome
creature
,
which
the
gentleman
of
this
our
age
agree
to
call
LOVE
,
and
which
be
indeed
no
other
than
that
kind
of
affection
which
,
after
the
exercise
of
the
dominical
day
be
over
,
a
lusty
divine
be
apt
to
conceive
for
the
well
-
dr
sirloin
or
handsome
buttock
which
the
well
-
edify
squire
in
gratitude
set
before
him
,
and
which
,
so
violent
be
his
love
,
he
devour
in
imagination
the
moment
he
see
it
.
<EOS>
not
less
ardent
be
the
hungry
passion
of
our
hero
,
who
,
from
the
moment
he
have
cast
his
eye
on
that
charming
dish
,
have
cast
about
in
his
mind
by
what
method
he
may
come
at
it
.
<EOS>
this
,
as
he
perceive
,
may
most
easily
be
effect
after
the
ruin
of
Heartfree
,
which
,
for
other
consideration
,
he
have
intend
.
<EOS>
so
he
postpone
all
endeavour
for
this
purpose
till
he
have
first
effect
that
,
by
order
of
time
,
be
regularly
to
precede
this
latter
design
;
with
such
regularity
do
this
our
hero
conduct
all
his
scheme
,
and
so
truly
superior
be
he
to
all
the
effort
of
passion
,
which
so
often
disconcert
and
disappoint
the
noble
view
of
other
.

a

hero
WORTHY
<EOS>
the

ASTONISHMENT

<EOS>
when
first
Wild
conduct
his
flame
(
or
rather
his
dish
,
to
continue
our
metaphor
)
from
the
proprietor
,
he
have
project
a
design
of
convey

one
of
those

in
covent

garden
,
where
female
flesh
be
deliciously

and
serve
up
to
the
greedy
appetite
of
young
gentleman
;
but
,
fear
lest
she
should
not
come
readily
enough
into
his
wish
,
and
that
,
by
too
eager
and
hasty
a
pursuit
,
he
should
frustrate
his
future
expectation
,
and
luckily
at
the
same
time
a
noble
hint
suggest
itself
to
him
,
by
which
he
may
almost
inevitably
secure
his
pleasure
,
together
with
his
profit
,
he
content
himself
with
wait
on
Mrs.
Heartfree
home
,
and
,
after
many
protestation
of
friendship
and
service
to
her
husband
,
take
his
leave
,
and
promise
to
visit
her
early
in
the
morning
,
and
to
conduct
her
back
to
Mr.
Snap
's

<EOS>
Wild
now
retire
to
a

where
he
find
several
of
his
acquaintance
,
with
whom
he
spend
the
remain
part
of
the
night
in
revelling
;
nor
do
the
least
compassion
for
Heartfree
's
misfortune
disturb
the
pleasure
of
his
cup
.
<EOS>
so
truly
great
be
his
soul
that
it

that

Miss
Tishy

some
discovery
(

she

in
no

towards

)
a
little
ruffled
and
disquiet
the
perfect
serenity
he
would
otherwise
have
enjoy
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
,
therefore
,
no
opportunity
of
see
her
that
evening
,
he
write
her
a
letter
full
of
ten
thousand
protestation
of
honourable
love
,
and
(
which
he
more
depend
on
)
contain
as
many
promise
,
in
order
to
bring
the
young
lady
into
good
humour
,
without
acquaint
her
in
the

with
his
suspicion
,
or
give
her
any

for
it
be
his

maxim
never

We
must
now
return
to
Mrs.

,
who
past
a
sleepless
night
in
as
great
agony

horror
for
the
absence

"
at
these
word
she
catch
the

in
her
arm
,
and
,
throw
herself
into
the
chair
in
an
agony
of
passion

cry
out

"

these
be
circumstance

and
,
secondly
,
by
expose
the
folly
of
this
low
creature
,
to
set
off
and
elevate
that
greatness
of

<EOS>
Wild
,
enter
the
room
,
find
the
mother
with
one
child
in
her
arm
,
and
the
other
at
her
knee
.
<EOS>
after
pay
her
his
compliment
,
he
desire
her
to
dismiss
the
child
and
servant
,
for
that
he
have
something
of
the
great
moment
to
impart
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
immediately
comply
with
his
request
,
and
,
the
door
be
shut
,
ask
him
with
great
eagerness
if
he
have
succeed
in
his
intention
of
procure
the
bail
.
<EOS>
He
answer
he
have
not
endeavour
at
it
yet
,
for
a
scheme
have
enter
into
his
head
by
which
she
may
certainly
preserve
her
husband
,
herself
,
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
which
he
advise
her
instantly
to
remove
with
the
most
valuable
jewel
she
have
to
Holland
,
before
any
statute
of
bankruptcy
issue
to
prevent
her
;
that
he
would
himself
attend
her
thither
and
place
her
in
safety
,
and
then
return
to
deliver
her
husband
,
who
would
be
thus
easily
able
to
satisfy
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
He
add
that
he
be
that
instant
come
from
Snap
's
,
where
he
have
communicate
the
scheme
to
Heartfree
,
who
have
greatly
approve
of
it
,
and
desire
her
to
put
it
in
execution
without
delay
,
conclude
that
a
moment
be
not
to
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
the
mention
of
her
husband
's
approbation
leave
no
doubt
in
this
poor
woman
's
breast
;
she
only
desire
a
moment
's
time
to
pay
him
a
visit
in
order
to
take
her
leave
.
<EOS>
but
Wild
peremptorily
refuse
;
he
say
by
every
moment
's
delay
she
risque
the
ruin
of
her
family
;
that
she
would
be
absent
only
a
few
day
from
him
,
for
that
the
moment
he
have
lodge
her
safe
in
Holland
,
he
would
return
,
procure
her
husband
his
liberty
,
and
bring
him
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
the
unfortunate
,
the
innocent
cause
of
all
my
dear
Tom
's
calamity
,
madam
,
say
he
,
and
I
will
perish
with
him
or
see
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
overflow
with
acknowledgment
of
his
goodness
,
but
still
beg
for
the
short
interview
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Wild
declare
that
a
minute
's
delay
may
be
fatal
;
and
add
,
though
with
the
voice
of
sorrow
rather
than
of
anger
,
that
if
she
have
not
resolution
enough
to
execute
the
command
he
bring
her
from
her
husband
,
his
ruin
would
lie
at
her
door
;
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
must
give
up
any
farth
meddling
in
his
affair
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
propose
to
take
her
child
with
her
;
but
Wild
would
not
permit
it
,
say
they
would
only
retard
their
flight
,
and
that
it
would
be
proper
for
her
husband
to
bring
them
.
<EOS>
He
at
length
absolutely
prevail
on
this
poor
woman
,
who
immediately
pack
up
the
most
valuable
effect
she
could
find
,
and
,
after
take
a
tender
leave
of
her
infant
,
earnestly
recommend
them
to
the
care
of
a
very
faithful
servant
.
<EOS>
then
they
call
a
hackney
-
coach
,
which
convey
them
to
an
inn
,
where
they
be
furnish
with
a
chariot
and
six
,
in
which
they
set
forward
for
Harwich
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
ride
with
an
exulting
heart
,
secure
,
as
he
now
think
himself
,
of
the
possession
of
that
lovely
woman
,
together
with
a
rich
cargo
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
be
enjoy
in
his
mind
all
the
happiness
which
unbridle
lust
and
rapacious
avarice
,
could
promise
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
poor
creature
who
be
to
satisfy
these
passion
,
her
whole
soul
be
employ
in
reflect
on
the
condition
of
her
husband
and
child
.
<EOS>
a
single
word
scarce
escape
her
lip
,
though
many
a
tear
gush
from
her
brilliant
eye
,
which
,
if
I
may
use
a
coarse
expression
,
serve
only
as
delicious
sauce
to
heighten
the
appetite
of
Wild

<EOS>
sea

adventures
very
new

surprising

<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
Harwich
they
find
a
vessel
,
which
have
put
in
there
,
just
ready
to
depart
for
Rotterdam
.
<EOS>
so
they
go
immediately
on
board
,
and
sail
with
a
fair
wind
;
but
they
have
hardly
proceed
out
of
sight
of
land
when
a
sudden
and
violent
storm
arise
and
drive
them
to
the
southwest
;
insomuch
that
the
captain
apprehend
it
impossible
to
avoid
the
Goodwin
Sands
,
and
he
and
all
his
crew
give
themselves
up
for
lose
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
,
who
have
no
other
apprehension
from
death
but
those
of
leave
her
dear
husband
and
child
,
fall
on
her
knee
to
beseech
the
Almighty
's
favour
,
when
Wild
,
with
a
contempt
of
danger
truly
great
,
take
a
resolution
as
worthy
to
be
admire
perhaps
as
any
record
of
the
brave
hero
,
ancient
or
modern
;
a
resolution
which
plainly
prove
him
to
have
these
two
qualification
so
necessary
to
a
hero
,
to
be
superior
to
all
the
energy
of
fear
or
pity

<EOS>
He
see
the
tyrant
death
ready
to
rescue
from
him
his
intend
prey
,
which
he
have
yet
devour
only
in
imagination

<EOS>
He
therefore
swear
he
would
prevent
him
,
and
immediately
attack
the
poor
wretch
,
who
be
in
the
utmost
agony
of
despair
,
first
with
solicitation
,
and
afterwards
with
force

<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
,
the
moment
she
understand
his
meaning
,
which
,
in
her
present
temper
of
mind
,
and
in
the
opinion
she
hold
of
him
,
she
do
not
immediately
,
reject
him
with
all
the
repulse
which
indignation
and
horror
could
animate
:
but
when
he
attempt
violence
she
fill
the
cabin
with
her
shriek
,
which
be
so
vehement
that
they
reach
the
ear
of
the
captain
,
the
storm
at
this
time
luckily
abating
.
<EOS>
this
man
,
who
be
a
brute
rather
from
his
education
and
the
element
he
inhabit
than
from
nature
,
run
hastily
down
to
her
assistance
,
and
,
find
her
struggling
on
the
ground
with
our
hero
,
he
presently
rescue
her
from
her
intend
ravisher
,
who
be
soon
oblige
to
quit
the
woman
,
in
order
to
engage
with
her
lusty
champion
,
who
spare
neither
pain
nor
blow
in
the
assistance
of
his
fair
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
short
battle
be
over
,
in
which
our
hero
,
have
he
not
be
overpower
with
number
,
who
come
down
on
their
captain
's
side
,
would
have
be
victorious
,
the
captain
rap
out
a
hearty
oath
,
and
ask
Wild
,
if
he
have
no
more
Christianity
in
him
than
to
ravish
a
woman
in
a
storm
?
<EOS>
to
which
the
other
greatly
and
sullenly
answer
,
"
It
be
very
well
;
but
d####n
him
if
he
have
not
satisfaction
the
moment
they
come
on
shore
.
"
<EOS>
the
captain
with
great
scorn
reply
,
"
kiss
,
 
"
&
c.
,
and
then
,
force
Wild
out
of
the
cabbin
,
he
,
at
Mrs.
Heartfree
's
request
,
lock
her
into
it
,
and
return
to
the
care
of
his
ship
.
  
<EOS>
the
storm
be
now
entirely
cease
,
and
nothing
remain
but
the
usual
ruffling
of
the
sea
after
it
,
when
one
of
the
sailor
spy
a
sail
at
a
distance
,
which
the
captain
wisely
apprehend
may
be
a
privateer
(
for
we
be
then
engage
in
a
war
with
France
)
,
and
immediately
order
all
the
sail
possible
to
be
crowd
;
but
his
caution
be
in
vain
,
for
the
little
wind
which
then
blow
be
directly
adverse
,
so
that
the
ship
bear
down
upon
them
,
and
soon
appear
to
be
what
the
captain
have
fear
,
a
french
privateer
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
no
condition
of
resistance
,
and
immediately
strike
on
her
fire
the
first
gun
.
<EOS>
the
captain
of
the
Frenchman
,
with
several
of
his
hand
,
come
on
board
the
english
vessel
,
which
they
rifle
of
everything
valuable
,
and
,
amongst
the
rest
,
of
poor
Mrs.
Heartfree
's
whole
cargo
;
and
then
take
the
crew
,
together
with
the
two
passenger
,
aboard
his
own
ship
,
he
determine
,
as
the
other
would
be
only
a
burthen
to
him
,
to
sink
her
,
she
be
very
old
and
leaky
,
and
not
worth
go
back
with
to
Dunkirk
.
<EOS>
He
preserve
,
therefore
,
nothing
but
the
boat
,
as
his
own
be
none
of
the
good
,
and
then
,
pour
a
broadside
into
her
,
he
send
her
to
the
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
the
french
captain
,
who
be
a
very
young
fellow
,
and
a
man
of
gallantry
,
be
presently
enamour
to
no
small
degree
with
his
beautiful
captive
;
and
imagine
Wild
,
from
some
word
he
dropt
,
to
be
her
husband
,
notwithstanding
the
ill
affection
towards
him
which
appear
in
her
look
,
he
ask
her
if
she
understand
French
.
<EOS>
She
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
for
indeed
she
do
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
her
how
long
she
and
that
gentleman
(
point
to
Wild
)
have
be
marry
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
with
a
deep
sigh
and
many
tear
,
that
she
be
married
indeed
,
but
not
to
that
villain
,
who
be
the
sole
cause
of
all
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
that
appellation
raise
a
curiosity
in
the
captain
,
and
he
importune
her
in
so
pressing
but
gentle
a
manner
to
acquaint
him
with
the
injury
she
complain
of
,
that
she
be
at
last
prevail
on
to
recount
to
him
the
whole
history
of
her
affliction
.
<EOS>
this
so
move
the
captain
,
who
have
too
little
notion
of
greatness
,
and
so
incense
him
against
our
hero
,
that
he
resolve
to
punish
him
;
and
,
without
regard
to
the
law
of
war
,
he
immediately
order
out
his
shatter
boat
,
and
,
make
Wild
a
present
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
biscuit
to
prolong
his
misery
,
he
put
him
therein
,
and
then
,
commit
him
to
the
mercy
of
the
sea
,
proceed
on
his
cruize
.
   
<EOS>
the
GREAT
and
wonderful
BEHAVIOUR
of
our
hero
in
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
a
desire
of
ingratiate
himself
with
his
charming
captive
,
or
rather
conqueror
,
have
no
little
share
in
promote
this
extraordinary
act
of
illegal
justice
;
for
the
Frenchman
have
conceive
the
same
sort
of
passion
or
hunger
which
Wild
himself
have
feel
,
and
be
almost
as
much
resolve
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
to
satisfy
it
.
<EOS>
We
will
leave
him
however
at
present
in
the
pursuit
of
his
wish
,
and
attend
our
hero
in
his
boat
,
since
it
be
in
circumstance
of
distress
that
true
greatness
appear
most
wonderful
.
<EOS>
for
that
a
prince
in
the
midst
of
his
courtier
,
all
ready
to
compliment
him
with
his
favourite
character
or
title
,
and
indeed
with
everything
else
,
or
that
a
conqueror
,
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
thousand
man
,
all
prepare
to
execute
his
will
,
how
ambitious
,
wanton
,
or
cruel
soever
,
should
,
in
the
giddiness
of
their
pride
,
elevate
themselves
many
degree
above
those
their
tool
,
seem
not
difficult
to
be
imagine
,
or
indeed
account
for
.
<EOS>
but
that
a
man
in
chain
,
in
prison
,
nay
,
in
the
vilest
dungeon
,
should
,
with
persevere
pride
and
obstinate
dignity
,
discover
that
vast
superiority
in
his
own
nature
over
the
rest
of
mankind
,
who
to
a
vulgar
eye
seem
much
happy
than
himself
;
<EOS>
nay
,
that
he
should
discover
heaven
and
providence
(
whose
peculiar
care
,
it
seem
,
he
be
)
<EOS>
at
that
very
time
at
work
for
him
;
this
be
among
the
arcana
of
greatness
,
to
be
perfectly
understand
only
by
an
adept
in
that
science
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
be
imagine
more
miserable
than
the
situation
of
our
hero
at
this
season
,
float
in
a
little
boat
on
the
open
sea
,
without
oar
,
without
sail
,
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
wave
to
overwhelm
him
?
<EOS>
nay
,
this
be
indeed
the
fair
side
of
his
fortune
,
as
it
be
a
much
more
eligible
fate
than
that
alternative
which
threaten
him
with
almost
unavoidable
certainty
,
viz
.
,
starve
with
hunger
,
the
sure
consequence
of
a
continuance
of
the
calm
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
find
himself
in
this
condition
,
begin
to
ejaculate
a
round
of
blasphemy
,
which
the
reader
,
without
be
over
-
pious
,
may
be
offend
at
see
repeat
.
<EOS>
He
then
accuse
the
whole
female
sex
,
and
the
passion
of
love
(
as
he
call
it
)
,
particularly
that
which
he
bear
to
Mrs.
Heartfree
,
as
the
unhappy
occasion
of
his
present
suffering
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
find
himself
descend
too
much
into
the
language
of
meanness
and
complaint
,
he
stop
short
,
and
after
break
forth
as
follow
:
<EOS>
"
D####n
it
,
a
man
can
die
but
once
!
<EOS>
what
signify
it
?
<EOS>
every
man
must
die
,
and
when
it
be
over
<EOS>
it
be
over

<EOS>
I
never
be
afraid
of
anything

nor
I
will
not
begin
now

<EOS>
no

I

die
whether

<EOS>
who
be

then
,
d####n
me

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
look
extremely
fierce
,
but
,
recollect
that
no
one
be
present
to
see
him
,
he
relax
a
little
the
terror
of
his
countenance
,
and
,
pause
a

,
repeat
the
word

I

,
"
cry
he
,
"
when
I
never
think
a
syllable
of
the
matter
?
<EOS>
I
have
often
laugh
and
make
a
jest
about
it
,
and
yet
it
may
be
so
,
for
anything
which
I
know
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
if
there
should
be
another
world
it
will
go
hard
with
me
,
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
escape
for
what
I
have
do
to
Heartfree

<EOS>
the
devil
must
have
me
for
that
undoubtedly

<EOS>
the
devil

<EOS>
Pshaw

<EOS>
I
be
not
such
a
fool
to
be
frighten
at
him
neither

<EOS>
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
when
a
man
's
dead
there
be
an
end
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
certainly
satisfied
of
it
though
:
for
there
be
some
man
of
learning
,
as
I
have
hear
,
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
It
be

a
bad
chance

I
stand

<EOS>
if
there
be
no

why
I
shall

if
there

let

I
dare
look
him
in

but
shall
I
stay
and
be
starve

<EOS>
no

I
will
eat
up
the
biscuit
the
french
son
of
a
whore
bestow
on
me
,
and
then
leap
into
the
sea
for
drink
,
since
the
unconscionable
dog
hath
not
allow
me
a
single
dram
.
<EOS>
"
have
thus
say
,
he
proceed
immediately
to
put
his
purpose
in
execution
,
and
,
as
his
resolution
never
fail
him
,
he
have
no
sooner
despatch
the
small
quantity
of
provision
which
his
enemy
have
with
no
vast
liberality
present
him
,
than
he
cast
himself
headlong
into
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
the
STRANGE
and
yet
natural
escape
of
our
HERO
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
have
with
wonderful
resolution
throw
himself
into
the
sea
,
as
we
mention
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
be
miraculously
within
two
minute
after
replace
in
his
boat
;
and
this
without
the
assistance
of
a
dolphin
or
a
seahorse
,
or
any
other
fish
or
animal
,
who
be
always
as
ready
at
hand
when
a
poet
or
historian
please
to
call
for
them
to
carry
a
hero
through
the
sea
,
as
any
chairman
at
a
coffee
-
house
door
near
St.
James
's
to
convey
a
beau
over
a
street
,
and
preserve
his
white
stocking
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
we
do
not
chuse
to
have
any
recourse
to
miracle
,
from
the
strict
observance
we
pay
to
that
rule
of
Horace
,
    
Nec
Deus
intersit
,
nisi
dignus
vindice
nodus
.
  
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
which
be
,
do
not
bring
in
a
supernatural
agent
when
you
can
do
without
him
;
and
indeed
we
be
much
deep
read
in
natural
than
supernatural
cause
.
<EOS>
We
will
therefore
endeavour
to
account
for
this
extraordinary
event
from
the
former
of
these
;
and
in
do
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
disclose
some
profound
secret
to
our
reader
,
extremely
well
worth
his
knowing
,
and
which
may
serve
him
to
account
for
many
occurrence
of
the
phenomenous
kind
which
have
formerly
appear
in
this
our
hemisphere
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
known
then
that
the
great
Alma
Mater
,
Nature
,
be
of
all
other
female
the
most
obstinate
,
and
tenacious
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
so
true
be
that
observation
,
    
Naturam
expella
furca
licet
,
usque
recurret
.
  
<EOS>
which
I
need
not
render
in
English
,
it
be
to
be
find
in
a
book
which
most
fine
gentleman
be
force
to
read
.
<EOS>
whatever
Nature
,
therefore
,
purpose
to
herself
,
she
never
suffer
any
reason
,
design
,
or
accident
to
frustrate
.
<EOS>
now
,
though
it
may
seem
to
a
shallow
observer
that
some
person
be
design
by
Nature
for
no
use
or
purpose
<EOS>
whatever
,
yet
certain
<EOS>
it
be
that
no
man
be
bear
into
the
world
without
his
particular
allotment
;
viz
.
<EOS>
,
some
to
be
king
,
some
statesman
,
some
ambassador
,
some
bishop
,
some
general
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
of
these
there
be
two
kind
;
those
to
whom
Nature
be
so
generous
to
give
some
endowment
qualify
them
for
the
part
<EOS>
she
intend
them
afterwards
to
act
on
this
stage
,
and
those
whom
she
use
as
instance
of
her
unlimited
power
,
and
for
whose
preferment
to
such
and
such
station
Solomon
himself
could
have
invent
no
other
reason
than
that
Nature
design
them
so
.
<EOS>
these
latter
some
great
philosopher
have
,
to
shew
them
to
be
the
favourite
of
Nature
,
distinguish
by
the
honourable
appellation
of
NATURALS
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
true
reason
of
the
general
ignorance
of
mankind
on
this
head
seem
to
be
this
;
that
,
as
nature
chuse
to
execute
these
her
purpose
by
certain
second
cause
,
and
as
many
of
these
second
cause
seem
so
totally
foreign
to
her
design
,
the
wit
of
man
,
which
,
like
his
eye
,
see
best
directly
forward
,
and
very
little
and
imperfectly
what
be
oblique
,
be
not
able
to
discern
the
end
by
the
mean
.
<EOS>
thus
,
how
a
handsome
wife
or
daughter
should
contribute
to
execute
her
original
designation
of
a
general
,
or
<EOS>
how
flattery
or
half
a
dozen
house
in
a
borough
-
town
should
denote
a
judge
,
or
a
bishop
,
he
be
not
capable
of
comprehend
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
we
ourselves
,
wise
as
we
be
,
be
force
to
reason
ab
effectu
;
and
if
we
have
be
ask
what
Nature
have
intend
such
man
for
,
before
she
herself
have
by
the
event
demonstrate
her
purpose
<EOS>
,
it
be
possible
we
may
sometimes
have
be
puzzle
to
declare
;
for
it
must
be
confess
that
at
first
sight
,
and
to
a
mind
uninspired
,
a
man
of
vast
natural
capacity
and
much
acquire
knowledge
may
seem
by
nature
design
for
power
and
honour
,
rather
than
one
remarkable
only
for
the
want
of
these
,
and
indeed
all
other
qualification
;
whereas
daily
experience
convince
us
of
the
contrary
,
and
drive
us
as
it
be
into
the
opinion
I
have
here
disclose
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Nature
have
originally
intend
our
great
man
for
that
final
exaltation
which
,
as
it
be
the
most
proper
and
become
end
of
all
great
man
,
it
be
heartily
to
be
wish
they
may
all
arrive
at
,
would
by
no
means
be
divert
from
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
no
sooner
spy
him
in
the
water
than
she
softly
whisper
in
his
ear
to
attempt
the
recovery
of
his
boat
,
which
call
he
immediately
obey
,
and
,
be
a
good
swimmer
,
and
it
be
a
perfect
calm
,
with
great
facility
accomplish
it
.
  
<EOS>
thus
we
think
this
passage
in
our
history
,
at
first
so
greatly
surprising
,
be
very
naturally
account
for
,
and
our
relation
rescue
from
the
Prodigious
,
which
,
though
it
often
occur
in
biography
,
be
not
to
be
encourage
nor
much
commend
on
any
occasion
,
unless
when
absolutely
necessary
to
prevent
the
history
's
being
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
we
hope
our
hero
be
justify
from
that
imputation
of
want
of
resolution
which
must
have
be
fatal
to
the
greatness
of
his
character
.
   
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
the
BOAT
ADVENTURE
,
and
the
end
of
the
second
BOOK
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
pass
the
remainder
of
the
evening
,
the
night
,
and
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
in
a
condition
not
much
to
be
envy
by
any
passion
of
the
human
mind
,
unless
by
ambition
;
which
,
provide
it
can
only
entertain
itself
with
the
most
distant
music
of
fame
's
trumpet
,
can
disdain
all
the
pleasure
of
the
sensualist
,
and
those
more
solemn
,
though
quieter
comfort
,
which
a
good
conscience
suggest
to
a
christian
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
He
spend
his
time
in
contemplation
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
blaspheming
,
cursing
,
and
sometimes
singe
and
whistle
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
cold
and
hunger
have
almost
subdue
his
native
fierceness
,
it
be
a
good
deal
past
midnight
and
extremely
dark
,
he
think
he
behold
a
light
at
a
distance
,
which
the
cloudiness
of
the
sky
prevent
his
mistaking
for
a
star
:
this
light
,
however
,
do
not
seem
to
approach
him
,
at
least
it
approach
by
such
imperceptible
degree
that
it
give
him
very
little
comfort
,
and
at
length
totally
forsook
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
renew
his
contemplation
as
before
,
in
which
he
continue
till
the
day
begin
to
break
,
when
,
to
his
inexpressible
delight
,
he
behold
a
sail
at
a
very
little
distance
,
and
which
luckily
seem
to
be
make
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
soon
espy
by
those
in
the
vessel
,
who
want
no
signal
to
inform
them
of
his
distress
,
and
,
as
it
be
almost
a
calm
,
and
their
course
lie
within
five
hundred
yard
of
him
,
they
hoist
out
their
boat
and
fetch
him
aboard
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
of
this
ship
be
a
Frenchman
;
she
be
laden
with
deal
from
Norway
,
and
have
be
extremely
shatter
in
the
late
storm
.
<EOS>
this
captain
be
of
that
kind
of
man
who
be
actuate
by
general
humanity
,
and
whose
compassion
can
be
raise
by
the
distress
of
a
fellow
-
creature
,
though
of
a
nation
whose
king
hath
quarrel
with
the
monarch
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
commiserate
the
circumstance
of
Wild
,
who
have
dress
up
a
story
proper
to
impose
upon
such
a
silly
fellow
,
tell
him
that
,
as
himself
well
know
,
he
must
be
a
prisoner
on
his
arrival
in
France
,
but
that
he
would
endeavour
to
procure
his
redemption
;
for
which
our
hero
greatly
thank
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
they
be
make
very
slow
sail
(
for
they
have
lose
their
main
-
mast
in
the
storm
)
,
Wild
see
a
little
vessel
at
a
distance
,
they
be
within
a
few
league
of
the
English
shore
,
which
,
on
enquiry
,
he
be
inform
<EOS>
be
probably
an
english
fishing
-
boat
.
<EOS>
and
,
it
be
then
perfectly
calm
,
he
propose
that
,
if
they
would
accommodate
him
with
a
pair
of
sculler
,
he
could
get
within
reach
of
the
boat
,
at
least
near
enough
to
make
signal
to
her
;
and
he
prefer
any
risque
to
the
certain
fate
of
be
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
as
his
courage
be
somewhat
restore
by
the
provision
(
especially
brandy
)
with
which
the
Frenchmen
have
supply
him
,
he
be
so
earnest
in
his
entreaty
,
that
the
captain
,
after
many
persuasion
,
at
length
comply
,
and
he
be
furnish
with
sculler
,
and
with
some
bread
,
pork
,
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
.
<EOS>
then
,
take
leave
of
his
preserver
,
he
again
betook
himself
to
his
boat
,
and
row
so
heartily
that
he
soon
come
within
the
sight
of
the
fisherman
,
who
immediately
make
towards
him
and
take
him
aboard
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
Wild
get
safe
on
board
the
fisherman
than
he
beg
him
to
make
the
utmost
speed
into
Deal
,
for
that
the
vessel
which
be
still
in
sight
be
a
distressed
Frenchman
,
bind
for
Havre
de
Grace
,
and
may
easily
be
make
a
prize
if
there
be
any
ship
ready
to
go
in
pursuit
of
her
.
<EOS>
so
nobly
and
greatly
do
our
hero
neglect
all
obligation
confer
on
him
by
the
enemy
of
his
country
,
that
he
would
have
contribute
all
he
could
to
the
take
his
benefactor
,
to
whom
he
owe
both
his
life
and
his
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
the
fisherman
take
his
advice
,
and
soon
arrive
at
Deal
,
where
the
reader
will
,
I
doubt
not
,
be
as
much
concerned
as
Wild
be
,
that
there
be
not
a
single
ship
prepare
to
go
on
the
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
now
see
himself
once
more
safe
on
terra
firma
,
but
unluckily
at
some
distance
from
that
city
where
man
of
ingenuity
can
most
easily
supply
their
want
without
the
assistance
of
money
,
or
rather
can
most
easily
procure
money
for
the
supply
of
their
want
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
his
talent
be
superior
to
every
difficulty
,
he
frame
so
dextrous
an
account
of
his
be
a
merchant
,
have
be
take
and
plunder
by
the
enemy
,
and
of
his
great
effect
in
London
,
that
he
be
not
only
heartily
regale
by
the
fisherman
at
his
house
,
but
make
so
handsome
a
booty
by
way
of
borrowing
,
a
method
of
taking
which
we
have
before
mention
to
have
his
approbation
,
that
he
be
enable
to
provide
himself
with
a
place
in
the
stage
-
coach
;
which
(
as
God
permit
it
to
perform
the
journey
)
bring
him
at
the
appoint
time
to
an
inn
in
the
metropolis
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
reader
,
as
thou
canst
be
in
no
suspense
far
the
fate
of
our
great
man
,
since
we
have
return
him
safe
to
the
principal
scene
of
his
glory
,
we
will
a
little
look
back
on
the
fortune
of
Mr.
Heartfree
,
whom
we
leave
in
no
very
pleasant
situation
;
<EOS>
but
of
this
we
shall
treat
in
the
next
book
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
III
   
<EOS>
the
LOW
and
PITIFUL
BEHAVIOUR
of
heartfree
;
and
the
FOOLISH
CONDUCT
of
his
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
His
misfortune
do
not
entirely
prevent
Heartfree
from
close
his
eye
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
sleep
several
hour
the
first
night
of
his
confinement
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
perhaps
pay
too
severely
dear
both
for
his
repose
and
for
a
sweet
dream
which
accompany
it
,
and
represent
his
little
family
in
one
of
those
tender
scene
which
have
frequently
pass
in
the
day
of
his
happiness
and
prosperity
,
when
the
provision
they
be
make
for
the
future
fortune
of
their
child
use
to
be
one
of
the
most
agreeable
topic
of
discourse
with
which
he
and
his
wife
entertain
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
pleasantness
of
this
vision
,
therefore
,
serve
only
,
on
his
awaking
,
to
set
forth
his
present
misery
with
additional
horror
,
and
to
heighten
the
dreadful
idea
which
now
crowd
on
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
spend
a
considerable
time
after
his
first
rise
from
the
bed
on
which
he
have
,
without
undressing
,
throw
himself
,
and
now
begin
to
wonder
at
Mrs.
Heartfree
's
long
absence
;
but
as
the
mind
be
desirous
(
and
perhaps
wisely
too
)
to
comfort
itself
with
draw
the
most
flattering
conclusion
from
all
event
,
so
he
hope
the
long
her
stay
be
the
more
certain
be
his
deliverance
.
<EOS>
at
length
his
impatience
prevail
,
and
he
be
just
go
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
his
own
house
when
his
apprentice
come
to
pay
him
a
visit
,
and
on
his
enquiry
inform
him
that
his
wife
have
depart
in
company
with
Mr.
Wild
many
hour
before
,
and
have
carry
all
his
most
valuable
effect
with
her
;
add
at
the
same
time
that
she
have
herself
positively
acquaint
him
<EOS>
she
have
her
husband
's
express
order
for
so
do
,
and
that
she
be
go
to
Holland
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
observation
of
many
wise
man
,
who
have
study
the
anatomy
of
the
human
soul
with
more
attention
than
our
young
physician
generally
bestow
on
that
of
the
body
,
that
great
and
violent
surprize
hath
a
different
effect
from
that
which
be
work
in
a
good
housewife
by
perceive
any
disorder
in
her
kitchen
;
who
,
on
such
occasion
,
commonly
spread
the
disorder
,
not
only
over
her
whole
family
,
but
over
the
whole
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
N
ow
,
these
great
calamity
,
especially
when
sudden
,
tend
to
stifle
and
deaden
all
the
faculty
,
instead
of
rouse
them
;
and
accordingly
Herodotus
tell
us
a
story
of
Croesus
king
of
Lydia
,
who
,
on
behold
his
servant
and
courtier
lead
captive
,
weep
bitterly
,
but
,
when
he
see
his
wife
and
child
in
that
condition
,
stand
stupid
and
motionless
;
so
stand
poor
Heartfree
on
this
relation
of
his
apprentice
,
nothing
move
but
his
colour
,
which
entirely
forsook
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
the
apprentice
,
who
have
not
in
the
least
doubt
the
veracity
of
his
mistress
,
perceive
the
surprize
which
too
visibly
appear
in
his
master
,
become
speechless
likewise
,
and
both
remain
silent
some
minute
,
gaze
with
astonishment
and
horror
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
Heartfree
cry
out
in
an
agony
,
"
My
wife
desert
me
in
my
misfortune
!
"
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
,
sir
!
"
answer
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
be
become
of
my
poor
child
?
<EOS>
"
reply
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
at
home
,
sir
,
"
say
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praise
!
<EOS>
She
hath
forsake
them
too
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Heartfree
<EOS>
:
"
fetch
them
hither
<EOS>
this
instant
.
<EOS>
go
,
my
dear
Jack
,
bring
hither
my
little
all
which
remain
now
:
fly
,
child
,
if
thou
dost
not
intend
likewise
to
forsake
me
in
my
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
youth
answer
he
would
die
sooner
than
entertain
<EOS>
such
a
thought
,
and
,
beg
his
master
to
be
comfort
,
instantly
obey
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
the
moment
the
young
man
be
depart
,
throw
himself
on
his
bed
in
an
agony
of
despair
;
but
,
recollect
himself
after
he
have
vent
the
first
sally
of
his
passion
,
he
begin
to
question
the
infidelity
of
his
wife
as
a
matter
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
run
over
in
his
thought
the
uninterrupted
tenderness
which
she
have
always
shew
him
,
and
,
for
a
minute
,
blame
the
rashness
of
his
belief
against
her
;
till
the
many
circumstance
of
her
have
leave
him
so
long
,
and
neither
writ
nor
send
to
him
since
her
departure
with
all
his
effect
and
with
Wild
,
of
whom
he
be
not
before
without
suspicion
,
and
,
lastly
and
chiefly
,
her
false
pretence
to
his
command
,
entirely
turn
the
scale
,
and
convince
him
of
her
disloyalty
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
these
agitation
of
mind
the
good
apprentice
,
who
have
use
the
utmost
expedition
,
bring
his
child
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
embrace
them
with
the
most
passionate
fondness
,
and
imprinted
numberless
kiss
on
their
little
lip
.
<EOS>
the
little
girl
fly
to
him
with
almost
as
much
eagerness
as
he
himself
expr
at
her
sight
,
and
cry
out
,
"
o
papa
,
why
do
you
not
come
home
to
poor
mamma
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
not
have
leave
your
little
Nancy
so
long
.
"
<EOS>
after
which
he
ask
her
for
her
mother
,
and
be
tell
she
have
kiss
them
both
in
the
morning
,
and
cry
very
much
for
his
absence
.
<EOS>
all
which
bring
a
flood
of
tear
into
the
eye
of
this
weak
,
silly
man
,
who
have
not
greatness
sufficient
to
conquer
these
low
effort
of
tenderness
and
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
enquire
of
the
maid
-
servant
,
who
acquaint
him
that
she
know
no
more
than
that
her
mistress
have
take
leave
of
her
child
in
the
morning
with
many
tear
and
kiss
,
and
have
recommend
them
in
the
most
earnest
manner
to
her
care
;
she
say
she
have
promise
faithfully
to
take
care
of
them
,
and
would
,
while
they
be
entrust
to
her
,
fulfil
her
promise
.
<EOS>
for
which
profession
Heartfree
express
much
gratitude
to
her
,
and
,
after
indulge
himself
with
some
little
fondness
which
we
shall
not
relate
,
he
deliver
his
child
into
the
good
woman
's
hand
,
and
dismiss
her
.
   
<EOS>
a
SOLILOQUY
of
HEARTFREE
's
,
FULL
of
LOW
and
BASE
IDEAS
,
without
a
syllable
of
GREATNESS
.
 
<EOS>
be
now
alone
,
he
sit
some
short
time
silent
,
and
then
burst
forth
into
the
follow
soliloquy
:
    
<EOS>
"
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
abandon
myself
to
a
dispirited
despair
,
or
fly
in
the
face
of
the
Almighty
?
<EOS>
surely
both
be
unworthy
of
a
wise
man
;
for
what
can
be
more
vain
than
weakly
to
lament
my
fortune
if
irretrievable
,
or
,
if
hope
remain
,
to
offend
that
be
who
can
most
strongly
support
it
?
<EOS>
but
be
my
passion
then
voluntary
?
<EOS>
be
I
so
absolutely
their
master
that
I
can
resolve
with
myself
,
so
far
only
will
I
grieve
?
<EOS>
certainly
no
.
<EOS>
reason
,
however
we
flatter
ourselves
,
hath
not
<EOS>
such
despotic
empire
in
our
mind
,
that
it
can
,
with
imperial
voice
,
hush
all
our
sorrow
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
where
then
be
its
use
?
<EOS>
for
either
it
be
an
empty
sound
,
and
we
be
deceive
in
think
we
have
reason
,
or
it
be
give
us
to
some
end
,
and
hath
a
part
assign
it
by
the
all
-
wise
creator
.
<EOS>
why
,
what
can
its
office
be
other
than
justly
to
weigh
the
worth
of
all
thing
,
and
to
direct
us
to
that
perfection
of
human
wisdom
which
proportion
our
esteem
of
every
object
by
its
real
merit
,
and
prevent
us
from
over
or
undervalue
whatever
we
hope
for
,
we
enjoy
,
or
we
lose
.
<EOS>
It
doth
not
foolishly
say
to
us
,
be
not
glad
,
or
,
be
not
sorry
,
which
would
be
as
vain
and
idle
as
to
bid
the
purl
river
cease
to
run
,
or
the
rage
wind
to
blow
.
<EOS>
It
prevent
us
only
from
exult
,
like
child
,
when
we
receive
a
toy
,
or
from
lament
when
we
be
deprive
of
it
.
<EOS>
suppose
then
I
have
lose
the
enjoyment
of
this
world
,
and
my
expectation
of
future
pleasure
and
profit
be
for
ever
disappoint
,
what
relief
can
my
reason
afford
?
<EOS>
what
,
unless
it
can
shew
me
<EOS>
I
have
fix
my
affection
on
a
toy
;
that
what
I
desire
be
not
,
by
a
wise
man
,
eagerly
to
be
affect
,
nor
its
loss
violently
deplore
?
<EOS>
for
there
be
toy
adapt
to
all
age
,
from
the
rattle
to
the
throne
;
and
perhaps
the
value
of
all
be
equal
to
their
several
possessor
;
for
if
the
rattle
please
the
ear
of
the
infant
,
what
can
the
flattery
of
sycophant
give
more
to
the
prince
?
<EOS>
the
latter
be
as
far
from
examine
into
the
reality
and
source
of
his
pleasure
as
the
former
;
for
if
both
do
,
they
must
both
equally
despise
it
.
<EOS>
and
surely
,
if
we
consider
them
seriously
,
and
compare
them
together
,
we
shall
be
force
to
conclude
all
those
pomp
and
pleasure
of
which
man
be
so
fond
,
and
which
,
through
so
much
danger
and
difficulty
,
with
such
violence
and
villany
,
they
pursue
,
to
be
as
worthless
trifle
as
any
expose
to
sale
in
a
toy
-
shop
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
note
my
little
girl
view
,
with
eager
eye
,
a
joint
baby
;
I
have
mark
the
pain
and
solicitation
<EOS>
she
hath
use
till
I
have
be
prevail
on
to
indulge
her
with
it
.
<EOS>
at
her
first
obtain
it
,
what
joy
hath
sparkle
in
her
countenance
!
<EOS>
with
what
rapture
hath
she
take
possession
!
<EOS>
but
how
little
satisfaction
hath
she
find
in
it
!
<EOS>
what
pain
to
work
out
her
amusement
from
it
!
<EOS>
Its
dress
must
be
varied
;
the
tinsel
ornament
which
first
catch
her
eye
produce
no
longer
pleasure
;
she
endeavour
to
make
it
stand
and
walk
in
vain
,
and
be
constrain
herself
to
supply
it
with
conversation
.
<EOS>
in
a
day
's
time
it
be
throw
by
and
neglect
,
and
some
less
costly
toy
prefer
to
it
.
<EOS>
how
like
the
situation
of
this
child
be
that
of
every
man
!
<EOS>
what
difficulty
in
the
pursuit
of
his
desire
!
<EOS>
what
inanity
in
the
possession
of
most
,
and
satiety
in
those
which
seem
more
real
and
substantial
!
<EOS>
the
delight
of
most
man
be
as
childish
and
as
superficial
as
that
of
my
little
girl
;
a
feather
or
a
fiddle
be
their
pursuit
and
their
pleasure
through
life
,
even
to
their
ripe
year
,
if
such
man
may
be
say
to
attain
any
ripeness
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
survey
those
whose
understanding
be
of
a
more
elevated
and
refined
temper
;
how
empty
do
they
soon
find
the
world
of
enjoyment
worth
their
desire
or
attaining
!
<EOS>
how
soon
do
they
retreat
to
solitude
and
contemplation
,
to
garden
and
plant
,
and
such
rural
amusement
,
where
their
tree
and
they
enjoy
the
air
and
the
sun
in
common
,
and
both
vegetate
with
very
little
difference
between
them
.
<EOS>
but
suppose
(
which
neither
truth
nor
wisdom
will
allow
)
we
could
admit
something
more
valuable
and
substantial
in
these
blessing
,
would
not
the
uncertainty
of
their
possession
be
alone
sufficient
to
lower
their
price
?
<EOS>
how
mean
a
tenure
be
that
at
the
will
of
fortune
,
which
chance
,
fraud
,
and
rapine
be
every
day
so
likely
to
deprive
us
of
,
and
often
the
more
likely
by
how
much
the
great
worth
our
possession
be
of
!
<EOS>
be
it
not
to
place
our
affection
on
a
bubble
in
the
water
,
or
on
a
picture
in
the
cloud
?
<EOS>
what
madman
would
build
a
fine
house
or
frame
a
beautiful
garden
on
land
in
which
he
hold
so
uncertain
an
interest
?
<EOS>
but
again
,
be
all
this
less
undeniable
,
do
Fortune
,
the
lady
of
our
manor
,
lease
to
us
for
our
life
,
of
how
little
consideration
must
even
this
term
appear
!
<EOS>
for
,
admit
that
these
pleasure
be
not
liable
to
be
tear
from
us
,
how
certainly
must
we
be
tear
from
them
!
<EOS>
perhaps
to
-
morrow
 
nay
,
or
even
sooner
;
for
as
the
excellent
poet
say
       
where
be
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
other
world
.
    
<EOS>
to
thousand
this
be
true
,
and
the
reverse
    
be
sure
to
none
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
I
have
no
further
hope
in
this
world
,
can
I
have
none
beyond
it
?
<EOS>
surely
those
laborious
writer
,
who
have
take
such
infinite
pain
to
destroy
or
weaken
all
the
proof
of
futurity
,
have
not
so
far
succeed
as
to
exclude
us
from
hope
.
<EOS>
that
active
principle
in
man
which
with
such
boldness
push
us
on
through
every
labour
and
difficulty
,
to
attain
the
most
distant
and
most
improbable
event
in
this
world
,
will
not
surely
deny
us
a
little
flattering
prospect
of
those
beautiful
mansion
which
,
if
they
could
be
think
chimerical
,
must
be
allow
the
lovely
which
can
entertain
the
eye
of
man
;
and
to
which
the
road
,
if
we
understand
it
rightly
,
appear
to
have
so
few
thorn
and
briar
in
it
,
and
to
require
so
little
labour
and
fatigue
from
those
who
shall
pass
through
it
,
that
its
way
be
truly
say
to
be
way
of
pleasantness
,
and
all
its
path
to
be
those
of
peace
.
<EOS>
if
the
proof
of
Christianity
be
as
strong
as
I
imagine
them
,
surely
enough
may
be
deduce
from
that
ground
only
,
to
comfort
and
support
the
most
miserable
man
in
his
affliction
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
think
my
reason
tell
me
,
that
,
if
the
professor
and
propagator
of
infidelity
be
in
the
right
,
the
loss
which
death
bring
to
the
virtuous
be
not
worth
their
lamenting
;
but
if
these
be
,
as
certainly
they
seem
,
in
the
wrong
,
the
blessing
it
procure
them
be
not
sufficiently
to
be
covet
and
rejoice
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
my
own
account
,
then
,
I
have
no
cause
for
sorrow
,
but
on
my
child
's
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
the
same
be
to
whose
goodness
and
power
<EOS>
I
intrust
my
own
happiness
<EOS>
be
likewise
as
able
and
as
willing
to
procure
theirs
.
<EOS>
nor
matter
it
what
state
of
life
be
allot
for
them
,
whether
it
be
their
fate
to
procure
bread
with
their
labour
,
or
to
eat
it
at
the
sweat
of
other
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
we
consider
the
case
with
proper
attention
,
or
resolve
it
with
due
sincerity
,
the
former
be
much
the
sweeter
.
<EOS>
the
hind
may
be
more
happy
than
the
lord
,
for
his
desire
be
few
,
and
those
such
as
be
attend
with
more
hope
and
less
fear
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
my
utmost
to
lay
the
foundation
of
my
child
's
happiness
,
I
will
carefully
avoid
educate
them
in
a
station
superior
to
their
fortune
,
and
for
the
event
trust
to
that
be
in
whom
whoever
rightly
confide
,
must
be
superior
to
all
worldly
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
low
manner
do
this
poor
wretch
proceed
to
argue
,
till
he
have
work
himself
up
into
an
enthusiasm
which
by
degree
soon
become
invulnerable
to
every
human
attack
;
so
that
when
Mr.
Snap
acquaint
him
with
the
return
of
the
writ
,
and
that
he
must
carry
him
to
Newgate
,
he
receive
the
message
as
Socrates
do
the
news
of
the
ship
's
arrival
,
and
that
he
be
to
prepare
for
death
.
   
<EOS>
wherein
<EOS>
our
HERO
PROCEEDS
in
the
road
to
GREATNESS
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
not
detain
our
reader
too
long
with
these
low
character
.
<EOS>
He
be
doubtless
as
impatient
as
the
audience
at
the
theatre
till
the
principal
figure
return
on
the
stage
;
we
will
therefore
indulge
his
inclination
,
and
pursue
the
action
of
the
Great
Wild
.
  
<EOS>
there
happen
to
be
in
the
stage
-
coach
in
which
Mr.
Wild
travel
from
Dover
a
certain
young
gentleman
who
have
sell
an
estate
in
Kent
,
and
be
go
to
London
to
receive
the
money
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
a
handsome
young
woman
who
have
leave
her
parent
at
Canterbury
,
and
be
proceed
to
the
same
city
,
in
order
(
as
she
inform
her
fellow
-
traveller
)
to
make
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
with
this
girl
the
young
spark
be
so
much
enamour
that
he
publickly
acquaint
her
with
the
purpose
of
his
journey
,
and
offer
her
a
considerable
sum
in
hand
and
a
settlement
if
she
would
consent
to
return
with
him
into
the
country
,
where
she
would
be
at
a
safe
distance
from
her
relation
.
<EOS>
whether
she
accept
this
proposal
or
no
we
be
not
able
with
any
tolerable
certainty
to
deliver
:
but
Wild
,
the
moment
he
hear
of
his
money
,
begin
to
cast
about
in
his
mind
by
what
mean
he
may
become
master
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
enter
into
a
long
harangue
about
the
method
of
carry
money
safely
on
the
road
,
and
say
,
"
He
have
at
that
time
two
bank
-
bill
of
a
hundred
pound
each
sew
in
his
coat
;
which
,
"
add
he
,
"
be
so
safe
a
way
,
that
it
be
almost
impossible
<EOS>
I
should
be
in
any
danger
of
be
rob
by
the
most
cunning
highwayman
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
who
be
no
descendant
of
Solomon
,
or
,
if
he
be
,
do
not
,
any
more
than
some
other
descendant
of
wise
man
,
inherit
the
wisdom
of
his
ancestor
,
greatly
approve
Wild
's
ingenuity
,
and
,
thank
him
for
his
information
,
declare
he
would
follow
his
example
when
he
return
into
the
country
;
by
which
mean
he
propose
to
save
the
premium
commonly
take
for
the
remittance
.
<EOS>
Wild
have
then
no
more
to
do
but
to
inform
himself
rightly
of
the
time
of
the
gentleman
's
journey
,
which
he
do
with
great
certainty
before
they
separate
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
arrival
in
town
he
fix
on
two
whom
he
regard
as
the
most
resolute
of
his
gang
for
this
enterprise
;
and
,
accordingly
,
have
summon
the
principal
,
or
most
desperate
,
as
he
imagine
him
,
of
these
two
(
for
he
never
choose
to
communicate
in
the
presence
of
more
than
one
)
,
he
propose
to
him
the
robbing
and
murder
this
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Marybone
(
for
that
be
the
gentleman
's
name
,
to
whom
he
apply
)
readily
agree
to
the
robbery
,
but
he
hesitate
at
the
murder
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
as
to
robbery
,
he
have
,
on
much
weigh
and
consider
the
matter
,
very
well
reconcile
his
conscience
to
it
;
for
,
though
that
noble
kind
of
robbery
which
be
execute
on
the
highway
be
,
from
the
cowardice
of
mankind
,
less
frequent
,
yet
the
baser
and
mean
specie
,
sometimes
call
cheating
,
but
more
commonly
know
by
the
name
of
robbery
within
the
law
,
be
in
a
manner
universal
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
therefore
pretend
to
the
reputation
of
be
so
much
honester
than
other
people
;
but
could
by
no
means
satisfy
himself
in
the
commission
of
murder
,
which
be
a
sin
of
the
most
heinous
nature
,
and
so
immediately
prosecute
by
God
's
judgment
that
it
never
pass
undiscovered
or
unpunished
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
,
with
the
utmost
disdain
in
his
countenance
,
answer
as
follow
:
"
<EOS>
art
thou
he
whom
I
have
select
out
of
my
whole
gang
for
this
glorious
undertaking
,
and
dost
thou
can
not
of
God
's
revenge
against
murder
?
<EOS>
You
have
,
it
seem
,
reconcile
your
conscience
(
a
pretty
word
)
to
robbery
,
from
its
being
so
common
.
<EOS>
be
it
then
the
novelty
of
murder
which
deter
you
?
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
that
gun
,
and
pistol
,
and
sword
,
and
knife
,
be
the
only
instrument
of
death
?
<EOS>
look
into
the
world
and
see
the
number
whom
break
fortune
and
break
heart
bring
untimely
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
to
omit
those
glorious
hero
who
,
to
their
immortal
honour
,
have
massacre
nation
,
what
think
you
of
private
persecution
,
treachery
,
and
slander
,
by
which
the
very
soul
of
man
be
in
a
manner
tear
from
their
body
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
more
generous
,
nay
,
more
good
-
natured
,
to
send
a
man
to
his
rest
,
than
,
after
have
plunder
him
of
all
he
hath
,
or
from
malice
or
malevolence
deprive
him
of
his
character
,
to
punish
him
with
a
languish
death
,
or
,
what
be
bad
,
a
languish
life
?
<EOS>
murder
,
therefore
,
be
not
so
uncommon
as
you
weakly
conceive
it
,
though
,
as
you
say
of
robbery
,
that
more
noble
kind
which
lie
within
the
paw
of
the
law
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
most
innocent
in
him
who
doth
it
,
and
the
most
eligible
to
him
who
be
to
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
lad
,
the
tongue
of
a
viper
be
less
hurtful
than
that
of
a
slanderer
,
and
the
gilded
scale
of
a
rattle
-
snake
less
dreadful
than
the
purse
of
the
oppressor
.
<EOS>
let
me
therefore
hear
no
more
of
your
scruple
;
but
consent
to
my
proposal
without
further
hesitation
,
unless
,
like
a
woman
,
you
be
afraid
of
blood
your
cloath
,
or
,
like
a
fool
,
be
terrify
with
the
apprehension
of
be
hang
in
chain
.
<EOS>
take
my
word
for
it
,
you
have
better
be
an
honest
man
than
half
a
rogue
.
<EOS>
do
not
think
of
continue
in
my
gang
without
abandon
yourself
absolutely
to
my
pleasure
;
for
no
man
shall
ever
receive
a
favour
at
my
hand
who
stick
at
anything
,
or
be
guide
by
any
other
law
than
that
of
my
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wild
then
end
his
speech
,
which
have
not
the
desire
effect
on
Marybone
:
he
agree
to
the
robbery
,
but
would
not
undertake
the
murder
,
as
Wild
(
who
fear
that
,
by
Marybone
's
demand
to
search
the
gentleman
's
coat

he
may
hazard
suspicion
himself

insist

his
black
-
book
,
and
be
presently
after
impeach
and
execute
as
a
fellow
on
whom
his
leader
could
not
place
sufficient
dependance
;
thus
fall
,
as
many
rogue
do
,
a
sacrifice
,
not
to
his
roguery
,
but
to
his
conscience
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
a
young
hero
,
of
WONDERFUL
good
promise
,
MAKES
his
first
appearance
,
with
many
other
great
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
next
apply
himself
to
another
of
his
gang
,
who
instantly
receive
his
order
,
and
,
instead
of
hesitate
at
a
single
murder
,
ask
if
he
should
blow
out
the
brain
of
all
the
passenger
,
coachman
and
all
.
<EOS>
but
Wild
,
whose
moderation
we
have
before
note
,
would
not
permit
him
;
and
therefore
,
<EOS>
have
give
him
an
exact
description
of
the
devoted
person
,
with
his
other
necessary
instruction
,
he
dismiss
him
,
with
the
strict
order
to
avoid
,
if
possible
,
do
hurt
to
any
other
person
.
  
<EOS>
the
name
of
this
youth
,
who
will
hereafter
make
some
figure
in
this
history
,
be
the
Achates
of
our
AEneas
,
or
rather
the
Hephaestion
of
our
Alexander
,
be
Fireblood
.
<EOS>
He
have
every
qualification
to
make
second
-
rate
GREAT
man
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
he
be
completely
equip
for
the
tool
of
a
real
or
first
-
rate
GREAT
man
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
(
which
be
the
proper
way
of
deal
with
this
kind
of
GREATNESS
)
describe
him
negatively
,
and
content
ourselves
with
tell
our
reader
what
quality
he
have
not
;
in
which
number
be
humanity
,
modesty
,
and
fear
,
not
one
grain
of
any
of
which
be
mingle
in
his
whole
composition
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
leave
this
youth
,
who
be
esteem
the
most
promising
of
the
whole
gang
,
and
whom
Wild
often
declare
to
be
one
of
the
pretty
lad
he
have
ever
see
,
of
which
opinion
,
indeed
,
be
most
other
people
of
his
acquaintance
;
we
will
however
leave
him
at
his
entrance
on
this
enterprize
,
and
keep
our
attention
fix
on
our
hero
,
whom
we
shall
observe
take
large
stride
towards
the
summit
of
human
glory
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
,
immediately
at
his
return
to
town
,
go
to
pay
a
visit
to
Miss
Laetitia
Snap
;
for
he
have
that
weakness
of
suffer
himself
to
be
enslave
by
woman
,
so
naturally
incident
to
man
of
heroic
disposition
;
to
say
the
truth
,
it
may
more
properly
be
call
a
slavery
to
his
own
appetite
;
for
,
could
he
have
satisfy
that
,
he
have
not
care
three
farthing
what
have
become
of
the
little
tyrant
for
whom
he
profess
so
violent
a
regard
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
inform
that
Mr.
Heartfree
have
be
convey
to
Newgate
the
day
before
,
the
writ
be
then
returnable
.
<EOS>
He
be
somewhat
concerned
at
this
news
;
not
from
any
compassion
for
the
misfortune
of
Heartfree
,
whom
he
hate
with
such
inveteracy
that
one
would
have
imagine
he
have
suffer
the
same
injury
from
him
which
he
have
do
towards
him
.
<EOS>
His
concern
therefore
have
another
motive
;
in
fact
,
he
be
uneasy
at
the
place
of
Mr.
Heartfree
's
confinement
,
as
it
be
to
be
the
scene
of
his
future
glory
,
and
where
consequently
he
should
be
frequently
oblige
to
see
a
face
which
hatred
,
and
not
shame
,
make
him
detest
the
sight
of
.
  
<EOS>
to
prevent
this
,
therefore
,
several
method
suggest
themselves
to
him
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
think
of
remove
him
out
of
the
way
by
the
ordinary
method
of
murder
,
which
he
doubt
not
but
fireblood
would
be
very
ready
to
execute
;
for
that
youth
have
,
at
their
last
interview
,
swear
,
D####n
<EOS>
his
eye
,
he
think
there
be
no
well
pastime
than
blow
a
man
's
brain
out
.
<EOS>
but
,
besides
the
danger
of
this
method
,
it
do
not
look
horrible
nor
barbarous
enough
for
the
last
mischief
which
he
should
do
to
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
considering
,
therefore
,
a
little
farther
with
himself
,
he
at
length
come
to
a
resolution
to
hang
him
,
if
possible
,
the
very
next
session
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
the
observation
 
how
apt
man
be
to
hate
those
they
injure
,
or
how
unforgive
they
be
of
the
injury
they
do
themselves
,
be
common
enough
,
yet
I
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
see
the
reason
of
this
strange
phaenomenon
as
at
first
<EOS>
it
appear
.
<EOS>
know
therefore
,
reader
,
that
with
much
and
severe
scrutiny
we
have
discover
this
hatred
to
be
found
on
the
passion
of
fear
,
and
to
arise
from
an
apprehension
that
the
person
whom
we
have
ourselves
greatly
injure
will
use
all
possible
endeavour
to
revenge
and
retaliate
the
injury
we
have
do
him
.
<EOS>
an
opinion
so
firmly
establish
in
bad
and
great
mind
(
and
those
who
confer
injury
on
other
have
seldom
very
good
or
mean
one
)
<EOS>
that
no
benevolence
,
nor
even
beneficence
,
on
the
injured
side
,
can
eradicate
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
they
refer
all
these
act
of
kindness
to
imposture
and
design
of
lull
their
suspicion
,
till
an
opportunity
offer
of
strike
a
sure
and
severer
blow
;
and
thus
,
while
the
good
man
who
hath
receive
it
hath
truly
forget
the
injury
,
the
evil
mind
which
do
it
hath
it
in
lively
and
fresh
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
scorn
to
keep
any
discovery
secret
from
our
reader
,
whose
instruction
,
as
well
as
diversion
,
we
have
greatly
consider
in
this
history
,
we
have
here
digress
somewhat
to
communicate
the
follow
short
lesson
to
those
who
be
simple
and
well
inclined
:
though
as
a
Christian
thou
art
oblige
,
and
we
advise
thee
,
to
forgive
thy
enemy
,
NEVER
TRUST
the
man
who
HATH
<EOS>
reason
to
SUSPECT
that
<EOS>
you
know
<EOS>
he
HATH
injured
you
.
   
<EOS>
MORE
and
MORE
GREATNESS
,
unparalleled
in
history
<EOS>
or
romance
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
accomplish
this
great
and
noble
scheme
,
which
the
vast
genius
of
Wild
have
contrive
,
the
first
necessary
step
be
to
regain
the
confidence
of
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
necessary
this
be
,
it
seem
to
be
attend
with
such
insurmountable
difficulty
,
that
even
our
hero
for
some
time
despair
of
success
.
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
superior
to
all
mankind
in
the
steadiness
of
his
countenance
,
but
this
undertaking
seem
to
require
more
of
that
noble
quality
than
have
ever
be
the
portion
of
a
mortal
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
he
resolve
to
attempt
it
,
and
from
his
success
I
think
we
may
fairly
assert
that
what
be
say
by
the
latin
poet
of
labour
,
that
it
conquer
all
thing
,
be
much
more
true
when
apply
to
impudence
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
form
his
plan
he
go
to
Newgate
,
and
burst
resolutely
into
the
presence
of
Heartfree
,
whom
he
eagerly
embrace
and
kiss
;
and
then
,
first
arraign
his
own
rashness
,
and
afterwards
lament
his
unfortunate
want
of
success
,
he
acquaint
him
with
the
particular
of
what
have
happen
;
conceal
only
that
single
incident
of
his
attack
on
the
other
's
wife
,
and
his
motive
to
the
undertaking
,
which
,
he
assure
Heartfree
,
be
a
desire
to
preserve
his
effect
from
a
statute
of
bankruptcy
.
  
<EOS>
the
frank
openness
of
this
declaration
,
with
the
composure
of
countenance
with
which
it
be
deliver
;
his
seeming
only
ruffle
by
the
concern
for
his
friend
's
misfortune
<EOS>
;
the
probability
of
truth
attend
it
,
join
to
the
boldness
and
disintereste
appearance
of
this
visit
,
together
with
his
many
profession
of
immediate
service
at
a
time
when
he
could
not
have
the
least
visible
motive
from
self
-
love
;
and
above
all
,
his
offer
him
money
,
the
last
and
sure
token
of
friendship
,
rush
with
such
united
force
on
the
well
-
dispose
heart
,
as
it
be
vulgarly
call
,
of
this
simple
man
,
that
they
instantly
stagger
and
soon
subvert
all
the
determination
he
have
before
make
in
prejudice
of
Wild
,
who
,
perceive
the
balance
to
be
turn
in
his
favour
,
presently
throw
in
a
hundred
imprecation
on
his
own
folly
and
ill
-
advise
forwardness
to
serve
his
friend
,
which
have
thus
unhappily
produce
his
ruin
;
he
add
as
many
curse
on
the
count
,
whom
he
vow
to
pursue
with
revenge
all
over
Europe
;
lastly
,
he
cast
in
some
grain
of
comfort
,
assure
Heartfree
that
his
wife
be
fall
into
the
gentle
hand
,
that
she
would
be
carry
no
farther
than
Dunkirk
,
<EOS>
whence
she
may
very
easily
be
redeem
.
  
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
to
whom
the
light
presumption
of
his
wife
's
fidelity
would
have
be
more
delicious
than
the
absolute
restoration
of
all
his
jewel
,
and
who
,
indeed
,
have
with
the
utmost
difficulty
be
bring
to
entertain
the
slight
suspicion
of
her
inconstancy
,
immediately
abandon
all
distrust
of
both
her
and
his
friend
,
whose
sincerity
(
luckily
for
Wild
's
purpose
)
seem
to
him
to
depend
on
the
same
evidence
.
<EOS>
He
then
embrace
our
hero
,
who
have
in
his
countenance
all
the
symptom
of
the
deep
concern
,
and
beg
him
to
be
comfort
;
say
that
the
intention
,
rather
than
the
action
of
man
,
confer
obligation
;
that
as
to
the
event
of
human
affair
,
it
be
govern
either
by
chance
or
some
superior
agent
;
that
friendship
be
concern
only
in
the
direction
of
our
design
;
and
suppose
these
fail
of
success
,
or
produce
an
event
never
so
contrary
to
their
aim
,
the
merit
of
a
good
intention
be
not
in
the
least
lessened
,
but
be
rather
entitle
to
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
Heartfree
however
be
soon
curious
enough
to
inquire
how
Wild
have
escape
the
captivity
which
his
wife
then
suffer
.
<EOS>
here
likewise
he
recount
the
whole
truth
,
omit
only
the
motive
to
the
french
captain
's
cruelty
,
for
which
he
assign
a
very
different
reason
,
namely
,
his
attempt
to
secure
Heartfree
's
jewel
.
<EOS>
Wild
indeed
always
keep
as
much
truth
as
be
possible
in
everything
;
and
this
he
say
be
turn
the
cannon
of
the
enemy
upon
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
,
have
thus
with
admirable
and
truly
laudable
conduct
achieve
the
first
step
,
begin
to
discourse
on
the
badness
of
the
world
,
and
particularly
to
blame
the
severity
of
creditor
,
who
seldom
or
never
attend
to
any
unfortunate
circumstance
,
but
without
mercy
inflict
confinement
on
the
debtor
,
whose
body
the
law
,
with
very
unjustifiable
rigour
,
deliver
into
their
power
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
for
his
part
,
he
look
on
this
restraint
to
be
as
heavy
a
punishment
as
any
appoint
by
law
for
the
great
offender
.
<EOS>
that
the
loss
of
liberty
be
,
in
his
opinion
,
equal
to
,
if
not
bad
,
than
the
loss
of
life
;
that
he
have
always
determine
,
if
by
any
accident
or
misfortune
he
have
be
subject
to
the
former
,
he
would
run
the
great
risque
of
the
latter
to
rescue
himself
from
it
;
which
he
say
,
if
man
do
not
want
resolution
,
be
always
enough
;
for
that
it
be
ridiculous
to
conceive
that
two
or
three
man
could
confine
two
or
three
hundred
,
unless
the
prisoner
be
either
fool
or
coward
,
especially
when
they
be
neither
chain
nor
fetter
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
in
this
manner
till
,
perceive
the
utmost
attention
in
Heartfree
,
he
venture
to
propose
to
him
an
endeavour
to
make
his
escape
,
which
he
say
may
easily
be
execute
;
that
he
would
himself
raise
a
party
in
the
prison
,
and
that
,
if
a
murder
or
two
should
happen
in
the
attempt
,
he
(
Heartfree
)
may
keep
free
from
any
share
either
in
the
guilt
or
in
the
danger
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
misfortune
which
attend
all
great
man
and
their
scheme
,
viz
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
in
order
to
carry
them
into
execution
,
they
be
oblige
,
in
propose
their
purpose
to
their
tool
,
to
discover
themselves
to
be
of
that
disposition
in
which
certain
little
writer
have
advise
mankind
to
place
no
confidence
;
an
advice
which
hath
be
sometimes
take
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
many
inconvenience
arise
to
the
say
great
man
from
these
scribbler
publish
without
restraint
their
hint
or
alarm
to
society
;
and
many
great
and
glorious
scheme
have
be
thus
frustrate
;
wherefore
it
be
to
be
wish
that
in
all
well
-
regulate
government
such
liberty
should
be
by
some
wholesome
law
restrain
,
and
all
writer
inhibit
from
vent
any
other
instruction
to
the
people
than
what
should
be
first
approve
and
license
by
the
say
great
man
,
or
their
proper
instrument
or
tool
;
by
which
mean
nothing
would
ever
be
publish
but
what
make
for
the
advance
their
most
noble
project
.
  
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
whose
suspicion
be
again
raise
by
this
advice
,
view
Wild
with
inconceivable
disdain
,
speak
as
follow
:
"
there
be
one
thing
the
loss
of
which
I
should
deplore
infinitely
beyond
that
of
liberty
and
of
life
also
;
I
mean
that
of
a
good
conscience
;
a
blessing
which
he
who
possess
can
never
be
thoroughly
unhappy
;
for
the
bitter
potion
of
life
be
by
this
so
sweetened
,
that
it
soon
become
palatable
;
whereas
,
without
it
,
the
most
delicate
enjoyment
quickly
lose
all
their
relish
,
and
life
itself
grow
insipid
,
or
rather
nauseous
,
to
us
.
<EOS>
Would
you
then
lessen
my
misfortune
by
rob
me
of
what
hath
be
my
only
comfort
under
them
,
and
on
which
I
place
my
dependence
of
be
relieve
from
them
?
<EOS>
I
have
read
that
Socrates
refuse
to
save
his
life
by
break
the
law
of
his
country
,
and
depart
from
his
prison
when
it
be
open
.
<EOS>
perhaps
my
virtue
would
not
go
so
far
;
but
heaven
forbid
liberty
should
have
such
charm
to
tempt
me
to
the
perpetration
of
so
horrid
a
crime
as
murder
!
<EOS>
as
to
the
poor
evasion
of
commit
it
by
other
hand
,
it
may
be
useful
indeed
to
those
who
seek
only
the
escape
from
temporal
punishment
,
but
can
be
of
no
service
to
excuse
me
to
that
be
whom
I
chiefly
fear
offending
;
nay
,
it
would
greatly
aggravate
my
guilt
by
so
impudent
an
endeavour
to
impose
upon
Him
,
and
by
so
wickedly
involve
other
in
my
crime
.
<EOS>
give
me
,
therefore
,
no
more
advice
of
this
kind
;
for
this
be
my
great
comfort
in
all
my
affliction
,
that
it
be
in
the
power
of
no
enemy
to
rob
me
of
my
conscience
,
nor
will
I
ever
be
so
much
my
own
enemy
as
to
injure
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
though
our
hero
hear
all
this
with
proper
contempt
,
he
make
no
direct
answer
,
but
endeavour
to
evade
his
proposal
as
much
as
possible
,
which
he
do
with
admirable
dexterity
:
this
method
of
get
tolerably
well
off
,
when
you
be
repulse
in
your
attack
on
a
man
's
conscience
,
may
be
stile
the
art
of
retreat
,
in
which
the
politician
,
as
well
as
the
general
,
hath
sometimes
a
wonderful
opportunity
of
display
his
great
ability
in
his
profession
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
,
have
make
this
admirable
retreat
,
and
argue
away
all
design
of
involve
his
friend
in
the
guilt
of
murder
,
conclude
,
however
,
that
he
think
him
rather
too
scrupulous
in
not
attempt
his
escape
and
then
,
promise
to
use
all
such
mean
as
the
other
would
permit
in
his
service
,
take
his
leave
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
have
indulge
himself
an
hour
with
his
child
,
repair
to
rest
,
which
he
enjoy
quiet
and
undisturbed
;
whilst
Wild
,
disdain
repose
,
sit
up
all
night
,
consult
how
he
may
bring
about
the
final
destruction
of
his
friend
,
without
be
behold
to
any
assistance
from
himself
,
which
he
now
despair
of
procure
.
<EOS>
with
the
result
of
these
consultation
we
shall
acquaint
our
reader
in
good
time
,
but
at
present
we
have
matter
of
much
more
consequence
to
relate
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
the
EVENT
of
fireblood
be
ADVENTURE
;
and
a
threat
of
marriage
,
which
may
have
BEEN
concluded
either
at
<EOS>
SMITHFIELD
or
ST
.
<EOS>
JAMES'S.
 
Fireblood
return
from
his
enterprise
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
happen
to
go
home
another
way
than
he
have
intend
;
so
that
the
whole
design
miscarry
.
<EOS>
fireblood
have
indeed
rob
the
coach
,
and
have
wantonly
discharge
a
pistol
into
it
,
which
lightly
wound
one
of
the
passenger
in
the
arm
.
<EOS>
the
booty
he
meet
with
be
not
very
considerable
,
though
much
great
than
that
with
which
he
acquaint
Wild
;
for
of
eleven
pound
in
money
,
two
silver
watch
,
and
a
wedding
-
ring
<EOS>
,
he
produce
no
more
than
two
guinea
and
the
ring
,
which
he
protest
with
numberless
oath
be
his
whole
booty
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
an
advertisement
of
the
robbery
be
publish
,
with
a
reward
promise
for
the
ring
and
the
watch
,
Fireblood
be
oblige
to
confess
the
whole
,
and
to
acquaint
our
hero
where
he
pawn
the
watch
;
which
Wild
,
take
the
full
value
of
them
for
his
pain
,
restore
to
the
right
owner
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
fail
catchise
his
young
friend
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
sorry
to
see
any
of
his
gang
guilty
of
a
breach
of
honour
;
that
without
honour
PRIGGERY
be
at
an
end
;
that
if
a
prig
have
but
honour
he
would
overlook
every
vice
in
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
forgive
you
this
time
,
as
you
be
a
hopeful
lad
,
and
I
hope
never
afterwards
to
find
you
delinquent
in
this
great
point

<EOS>
Wild
have
now
bring
his

to
great
regularity

he
be

and

by

all

He
have
likewise
establish
an
office
,
where
all
man
who
be
rob
,
pay
the
value
only
(
or
a
little
more
)
of
their
good

may
have
them

.
<EOS>
this
be
of
notable
use
to
several
person
who
have
lose
piece
of
plate
they
have
receive
from
their
grand

to

value
for
certain
ring
,
watch
,
head
of
cane
,
snuff
-
box
,
&
c.
,
for
which
they
would
not
have
take
twenty
time
as
much
as
they
be
worth
,
either
because
they
have
them
a
little
while
or
a
long
time
,
or
that
somebody
else
have
have
them
before
,
or
from
some
other
such
excellent
reason
,
which
often
stamp
a
great
value
on

the

by

if

strictly
orthographical

the

will
be
pleased
to
remember
that
such
a
defect
may
be
worthy
of
censure
in
a
low
and
scholastic
character

but
can
be
no
blemish
in
that
sublime
greatness

in

<EOS>
in

of

again

not

with
that
of

which
we

we
answer
,
it
be
sufficient
if
in

the

adhere
faithfully
to
the

though
he
embellish
the

the

<EOS>
nay

even

a
leer

that
Fireblood

who

begin

he
in

ravish

would

ravish
her

if

<EOS>
Fireblood

after

return

if

not
Wild

thoroughly
convinced

however

he
be

by

entirely
satisfied

inclination

<EOS>
thus
constitute
be
the
love
affair
of
our

when
his

bring
him
Mr.

proposal

the

must

<EOS>
not
guilty
never
sound
sweeter

a
prisoner
at

nor
the
sound
of
a
reprieve
to
one
at
the
gallow
,
than
do
every
word
of
the
old
gentleman
in
the
ear
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
He
give
his
father
full
power
to
treat
in
his
name
,
and
desire
nothing
more
than
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
people
now
meet
,
and
Snap
,
who
have
information
from
his
daughter
of
the
violent
passion
of
her
lover
,
endeavour
to
improve
it
to
the
good
advantage
,
and
would
have
not
only
decline
give
her
any
fortune
himself
,
but
have
attempt
to
cheat
her
of
what
she
owe
to
the
liberality
of
her
relation
,
particularly
of
a
pint
silver
caudle
-
cup
,
the
gift
of
her
grandmother
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
this
the
young
lady
herself
afterwards
take
care
to
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
old
Mr.
Wild
,
he
do
not
sufficiently
attend
to
all
the
design
of
Snap
,
as
his
faculty
be
busily
employ
in
design
of
his
own
,
to
overreach
(
or
,
as
other
express
it
,
to
cheat
)
<EOS>
the
say
Mr.
Snap
,
by
pretend
to
give
his
son
a
whole
number
for
a
chair
,
when
in
reality
he
be
intitle
to
a
third
only
.
  
<EOS>
while
matter
be
thus
settle
between
the
old
folk
the
young
lady
agree
to
admit
Mr.
Wild
's
visit
,
and
,
by
degree
,
begin
to
entertain
him
with
all
the
shew
of
affection
which
the
great
natural
reserve
of
her
temper
,
and
the
great
artificial
reserve
of
her
education
,
would
permit
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
everything
be
agree
between
their
parent
,
settlement
make
,
and
the
lady
's
fortune
(
to
wit
,
seventeen
pound
and
nine
shilling
in
money
and
good
)
pay
down
,
the

they

<EOS>
Most
private
history
,
as
well
as
comedy
,
end
at
this
period
;
the
historian
and
the
poet
both
conclude
they
have
do
enough
for
their
hero
when
they
have
marry
him
;
or
intimate
rather
that
the
rest
of
his
life
must
be
a
dull
calm
of
happiness
,
very
delightful
indeed
to
pass
through
,
but
somewhat
insipid
to
relate
;
and
matrimony
in
general
must
,
I
believe
,
without
any
dispute
,
be
allow
to
be
this
state
of
tranquil
felicity
,
include
so
little
variety
,
that
,
like
Salisbury
Plain
,
it
afford
only
one
prospect
,
a
very
pleasant
one
it
must
be
confess
,
but
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
all
the
probability
imaginable
that
this
contract
would
have
prove
of
such
happy
note
,
both
from
the
great
accomplishment
of
the
young
lady
,
who
be
think
to
be
possess
of
every
qualification
necessary
to
make
the
marriage
state
happy
,
and
from
the
truly
ardent
passion
of
Mr.
Wild
;
but
,
whether
it
be
that
nature
and
fortune
have
great
design
for
him
to
execute
,
and
would
not
suffer
his
vast
ability
to
be
lose
and
sink
in
the
arm
of
a
wife
,
or
whether
neither
nature
nor
fortune
have
any
hand
in
the
matter
,
be
a
point
I
will
mot
determine
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
this
match
do
not
produce
that
serene
state
we
have
mention
above
,
but
resemble
the
most
turbulent
and
ruffle
,
rather
than
the
most
calm
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
a
conjecture
,
ingenious
enough
,
of
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
have
a
long
intimacy
in
the
Wild
family
.
<EOS>
He
hath
often
tell
me
he
fancy
one
reason
of
the
dissatisfaction
which
afterwards
fall
out
between
Wild
and
his
lady
,
arise
from
the
number
of
gallant
to
whom
she
have
,
before
marriage
,
grant
favour
;
for
,
say
he
,
and
indeed
very
probable
it
be
too
,
the
lady
may
expect
from
her
husband
what
she
have
before
receive
from
several
,
and
,
be
angry
not
to
find
one
man
as
good
as
ten
,
she
have
,
from
that
indignation
,
take
those
step
which
we
can
not
perfectly
justify
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
person
I
receive
the
follow
dialogue
,
which
he
assure
me
he
have
overhear
and
take
down
verbatim
.
<EOS>
It
pass
on
the
day
fortnight
after
they
be
marry
.
   
<EOS>
a
DIALOGUE
MATRIMONIAL
,
which
PASSED
between
JONATHAN
WILD
,
ESQ
.
,
and
LAETITIA
his
WIFE
,
on
<EOS>
the
morning
of
the
DAY
<EOS>
fortnight
on
which
<EOS>
his
nuptials
be
celebrate
;
which
conclude
MORE
AMICABLY
than
those
debate
GENERALLY
do
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
wish
you
would
lie
a
little
longer
in
bed
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
not
;
I
be
engage
to
breakfast
with
Jack
Strongbow
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
Jack
Strongbow
doth
so
often
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
be
uneasy
at
it
;
for
,
though
I
have
no
suspicion
of
your
virtue
,
yet
it
may
injure
your
reputation
in
the
opinion
of
my
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
trouble
my
head
about
my
neighbour
;
and
they
shall
no
more
tell
me
what
company
I
be
to
keep
than
my
husband
shall
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
a
good
wife
would
keep
no
company
which
make
her
husband
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
find
one
of
those
good
wife
,
sir
,
if
you
have
please
;
I
have
no
objection
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
find
one
in
you
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
You
do
!
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
for
think
me
<EOS>
so
poor
-
spirit
a
creature
;
but
I
hope
to
convince
you
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
suppose
you
take
me
for
a
raw
senseless
girl
,
who
know
nothing
what
other
married
woman
do
!
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
no
matter
what
I
take
you
for
:
I
have
take
you
for
well
and
bad
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
and
at
your
own
desire
too
;
for
I
be
sure
you
never
have
mine
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
break
my
heart
if
Mr.
Wild
have
think
proper
to
bestow
himself
on
any
other
more
happy
woman
.
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
do
not
imagine
that
be
not
in
my
power
,
or
that
I
marry
you
out
of
any
kind
of
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
o
no
,
sir
;
I
be
convinced
there
be
silly
woman
enough
.
<EOS>
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
accuse
you
of
any
necessity
for
a
wife
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
could
have
be
very
well
contented
with
the
state
of
a
bachelor
;
I
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
your
necessity
;
but
that
,
you
know
,
a
woman
can
not
tell
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
what
you
would
insinuate
,
for
I
believe
no
woman
have
ever
less
reason
to
complain
of
her
husband
's
want
of
fondness
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
then
some
,
I
be
certain
,
have
great
reason
to
complain
of
the
price
they
give
for
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
well
thing
.
<EOS>
(
these
word
be
speak
with
a
very
great
air
,
and
toss
of
the
head
.
)
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
well
,
my
sweeting
,
I
will
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
wish
me
more
fond
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mr.
Wild
,
none
of
this
nauseous
behaviour
,
nor
those
odious
word
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
be
fond
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
do
not
know
what
you
would
pretend
to
insinuate
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
which
misbecome
a
virtuous
woman
.
<EOS>
no
,
nor
should
not
,
if
I
have
marry
for
love
.
<EOS>
and
especially
now
,
when
nobody
,
I
be
sure
,
can
suspect
me
of
any
such
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
marry
for
love
why
do
you
marry
?
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
because
it
be
convenient
,
and
my
parent
force
me
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
madam
,
<EOS>
at
least
,
you
will
not
tell
me
to
my
face
you
have
make
your
convenience
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
nothing
of
you
;
nor
do
I
desire
the
honour
of
make
anything
of
you
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
yes
,
you
have
make
a
husband
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
no
,
you
make
yourself
so
;
for
I
repeat
once
more
it
be
not
my
desire
,
but
your
own
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
You
should
think
yourself
oblige
to
me
for
that
desire
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
La
,
sir
!
<EOS>
you
be
not
so
singular
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
despair
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
other
offer
,
and
better
too
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
accept
them
with
all
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
Mr.
Wild
,
this
be
a
very
brutish
manner
in
treat
a
woman
to
whom
you
have
such
obligation
;
but
I
know
how
to
despise
it
,
and
to
despise
you
too
for
shew
it
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
well
enough
pay
for
the
foolish
preference
I
give
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
flatter
myself
that
I
should
at
least
have
be
use
with
good
manner
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
marry
a
gentleman
;
but
I
find
you
every
way
contemptible
and
below
my
concern
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
D####n
you
,
madam
<EOS>
,
have
I
not
more
reason
to
complain
when
you
tell
me
you
marry
for
your
convenience
only
?
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
very
fine
truly
.
<EOS>
be
it
behaviour
worthy
a
man
to
swear
at
a
woman
?
<EOS>
yet
why
should
I
mention
what
come
from
a
wretch
whom
I
despise
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
do
not
repeat
that
word
so
often
.
<EOS>
I
despise
you
as
heartily
as
you
can
me
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
tell
you
a
truth
,
I
marry
you
for
my
convenience
likewise
,
to
satisfy
a
passion
which
I
have
now
satisfy
,
and
you
may
be
d####d
for
anything
I
care
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
the
world
shall
know
how
barbarously
I
be
treat
by
such
a
villain
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
need
take
very
little
pain
to
acquaint
the
world
what
a
b
 
ch
<EOS>
you
be
,
your
action
will
demonstrate
it
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
monster
!
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
not
to
depend
too
much
on
my
sex
,
and
provoke
me
too
far
;
for
I
can
do
you
a
mischief
,
and
will
,
if
you
dare
use
me
<EOS>
so
,
you
villain
!
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
begin
whenever
you
please
,
madam
;
but
assure
yourself
,
the
moment
you
lay
aside
the
woman
,
I
will
treat
you
as
such
no
longer
;
and
if
the
first
blow
be
yours
,
I
promise
you
the
last
shall
be
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
use
me
as
you
will
;
but
d####n
me
if
ever
you
shall
use
me
as
a
woman
again
;
for
may
I
be
curse
if
ever
I
enter
into
your
bed
more
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
May
I
be
curse
if
that
abstinence
be
not
the
great
obligation
you
can
lay
upon
me
;
for
I
assure
you
faithfully
your
person
be
all
I
have
ever
any
regard
for
;
and
that
I
now
loathe
and
detest
as
much
as
ever
<EOS>
I
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
two
people
to
agree
better
;
for
I
always
detest
your
person
;
and
as
for
any
other
regard
,
you
must
be
convince
I
never
could
have
any
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
since
we
be
come
to
a
right
understanding
,
as
we
be
to
live
together
,
suppose
we
agree
,
instead
of
quarrel
and
abuse
,
to
be
civil
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
let
us
shake
hand
then
,
and
henceforward
never
live
like
man
and
wife
;
that
is
,
never
be
love
nor
ever
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
agree
.
<EOS>
but
pray
,
Mr.
Wild
,
why
b
 
ch
?
<EOS>
why
do
you
suffer
such
a
word
to
escape
you
?
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
worth
your
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
You
agree
I
shall
converse
with
whomsoever
<EOS>
I
please
?
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
without
controul
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
same
liberty
?
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
when
I
interfere
may
every
curse
you
can
wish
attend
me
!
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
let
us
now
take
a
farewell
kiss
,
and
may
I
be
hang
if
it
be
not
the
sweetest
you
ever
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
Laetitia
.
<EOS>
but
why
b
 
ch
?
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
why
b
 
ch
?
  
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
spring
from
the
bed
,
d
 
e
her
temper
heartily
.
<EOS>
She
return
it
again
with
equal
abuse
,
which
be
continue
on
both
side
while
he
be
dress
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
agree
to
continue
steadfast
in
this
new
resolution
;
and
the
joy
arise
on
that
occasion
at
length
dismiss
them
pretty
chearfully
from
each
other
,
though
Laetitia
could
not
help
conclude
with
the
word
,
why
b
 
ch
?
   
<EOS>
observations
on
the
foregoing
dialogue
,
together
with
a
base
design
on
our
hero
,
which
MUST
be
detest
by
every
LOVER
of
GREATNESS
.
 
<EOS>
thus
do
this
dialogue
(
which
,
though
we
have
term
it
matrimonial
,
have
indeed
very
little
savour
of
the
sweet
of
matrimony
in
it
)
produce
at
last
a
resolution
more
wise
than
strictly
pious
,
and
which
,
if
they
could
have
rigidly
adhere
to
it
,
may
have
prevent
some
unpleasant
moment
as
well
to
our
hero
as
to
his
serene
consort
;
but
their
hatred
be
so
very
great
and
unaccountable
that
they
never
could
bear
to
see
the
least
composure
in
one
another
's
countenance
without
attempt
to
ruffle
it
.
<EOS>
this
set
them
on
so
many
contrivance
to
plague
and
vex
one
another
,
that
,
as
their
proximity
afford
them
such
frequent
opportunity
of
execute
their
malicious
purpose
,
they
seldom
pass
one
easy
or
quiet
day
together
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
,
reader
,
and
no
other
,
be
the
cause
of
those
many
inquietude
which
thou
must
have
observe
to
disturb
the
repose
of
some
marry
couple
who
mistake
implacable
hatred
for
indifference
;
for
why
should
Corvinus
,
who
live
in
a
round
of
intrigue
,
and
seldom
doth
,
and
never
willingly
would
,
dally
with
his
wife
,
endeavour
to
prevent
her
from
the
satisfaction
of
an
intrigue
in
her
turn
?
<EOS>
why
doth
Camilla
refuse
a
more
agreeable
invitation
abroad
,
only
to
expose
her
husband
at
his
own
table
at
home
?
<EOS>
in
short
,
to
mention
no
more
instance
,
whence
can
all
the
quarrel
,
and
jealousy
,
and
jar
proceed
in
people
who
have
no
love
for
each
other
,
unless
from
that
noble
passion
above
mention
,
that
desire
,
accord
to
my
lady
Betty
Modish
,
of
cure
each
other
of
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
We
think
proper
to
give
our
reader
a
short
taste
of
the
domestic
state
of
our
hero
,
the
rather
to
shew
him
that
great
man
be
subject
to
the
same
frailty
and
inconvenience
in
ordinary
life
with
little
man
,
and
that
hero
be
really
of
the
same
specie
with
other
human
creature
,
notwithstanding
all
the
pain
they
themselves
or
their
flatterer
take
to
assert
the
contrary
;
and
that
they
differ
chiefly
in
the
immensity
of
their
greatness
,
or
,
as
the
vulgar
erroneously
call
it
,
villany
.
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
that
we
may
not
dwell
too
long
on
low
scene
in
a
history
of
the
sublime
kind
,
we
shall
return
to
action
of
a
high
note
and
more
suitable
to
our
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
boy
Hymen
have
,
with
his
light
torch
,
drive
the
boy
Cupid
out
of
door
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
common
phrase
,
when
the
violence
of
Mr.
Wild
's
passion
(
or
rather
appetite
)
for
the
chaste
Laetitia
begin
to
abate
,
he
return
to
visit
his
friend
Heartfree
,
who
be
now
in
the
liberty
of
the
Fleet
,
and
appear
to
the
commission
of
bankruptcy
against
him
.
<EOS>
here
he
meet
with
a
more
cold
reception
than
he
himself
have
apprehend
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
have
long
entertain
suspicion
of
Wild
,
but
these
suspicion
have
from
time
to
time
be
confound
with
circumstance
,
and
principally
smother
with
that
amazing
confidence
which
be
indeed
the
most
striking
virtue
in
our
hero
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
be
unwilling
to
condemn
his
friend
without
certain
evidence
,
and
lay
hold
on
every
probable
semblance
to
acquit
him
;
but
the
proposal
make
at
his
last
visit
have
so
totally
blacken
his
character
in
this
poor
man
's
opinion
,
that
it
entirely
fix
the
wavering
scale
,
and
he
no
longer
doubt
but
that
our
hero
be
one
of
the
great
villain
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
circumstance
of
great
improbability
often
escape
man
who
devour
a
story
with
greedy
ear
;
the
reader
,
therefore
,
can
not
wonder
that
Heartfree
,
whose
passion
be
so
variously
concerned
,
first
for
the
fidelity
,
and
secondly
for
the
safety
of
his
wife
;
and
,
lastly
,
who
be
so
distracted
with
doubt
concern
the
conduct
of
his
friend
,
should
at
this
relation
pass
unobserve
the
incident
of
his
be
commit
to
the
boat
by
the
captain
of
the
privateer
,
which
he
have
at
the
time
of
his
tell
so
lamely
account
for
;
but
now
,
when
Heartfree
come
to
reflect
on
the
whole
,
and
with
a
high
prepossession
against
Wild
,
the
absurdity
of
this
fact
glare
in
his
eye
and
strike
him
in
the
most
sensible
manner
.
<EOS>
at
length
a
thought
of
great
horror
suggest
itself
to
his
imagination
,
and
this
be
,
whether
the
whole
be
not
a
fiction
,
and
Wild
,
who
be
,
as
he
have
learn
from
his
own
mouth
,
equal
to
any
undertaking
<EOS>
how
black
soever
,
have
not
spirit
away
,
rob
,
and
murder
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
intolerable
as
this
apprehension
be
,
he
not
only
turn
it
round
and
examine
it
carefully
in
his
own
mind
,
but
acquaint
young
Friendly
with
it
at
their
next
interview
.
<EOS>
friendly
,
who
detest
Wild
(
from
that
envy
probably
with
which
these
great
character
naturally
inspire
low
fellow
)
,
encourage
these
suspicion
so
much
,
that
Heartfree
resolve
to
attach
our
hero
and
carry
him
before
a
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
this
resolution
have
be
some
time
take
,
and
friendly
,
with
a
warrant
and
a
constable
,
have
with
the
utmost
diligence
search
several
day
for
our
hero
;
but
,
whether
it
be
that
in
compliance
with
modern
custom
he
have
retire
to
spend
the
honey
-
moon
with
his
bride
,
the
only
moon
indeed
in
which
it
be
fashionable
or
customary
for
the
married
party
to
have
any
correspondence
with
each
other
;
or
perhaps
his
habitation
may
for
particular
reason
be
usually
keep
a
secret
,
like
those
of
some
few
great
man
whom
unfortunately
the
law
hath
leave
out
of
that
reasonable
as
well
as
honourable
provision
which
it
hath
make
for
the
security
of
the
person
of
other
great
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
Wild
resolve
to
perform
work
of
supererogation
in
the
way
of
honour
,
and
,
though
no
hero
be
oblige
to
answer
the
challenge
of
my
lord
chief
justice
,
or
indeed
of
any
other
magistrate
,
but
may
with
unblemished
reputation
slide
away
from
it
,
yet
such
be
the
bravery
,
such
the
greatness
,
the
magnanimity
of
Wild
,
that
he
appear
in
person
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
envy
may
say
one
thing
,
which
may
lessen
the
glory
of
this
action
,
namely
,
that
the
say
Mr.
Wild
know
nothing
of
the
said
warrant
or
challenge
;
and
as
thou
mayest
be
assure
,
reader
,
that
the
malicious
fury
will
omit
nothing
which
can
anyways
sully
so
great
a
character
,
so
<EOS>
she
hath
endeavour
to
account
for
this
second
visit
of
our
hero
to
his
friend
Heartfree
from
a
very
different
motive
than
that
of
assert
his
own
innocence
.
   
<EOS>
MR
.
<EOS>
WILD
with
unprecedented
generosity
visit
his
friend
heartfree
,
and
<EOS>
the
UNGRATEFUL
reception
he
meet
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
hath
be
say
then
that
Mr.
Wild
,
not
be
able
on
the
strict
examination
to
find
in
a
certain
spot
of
human
nature
call
his
own
heart
the
least
grain
of
that
pitiful
low
quality
call
honesty
,
have
resolve
,
perhaps
a
little
too
generally
,
that
there
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
impute
the
resolution
with
which
Mr.
Heartfree
have
so
positively
refuse
to
concern
himself
in
murder
,
either
to
a
fear
of
bloody
his
hand
or
the
apprehension
of
a
ghost
,
or
lest
he
should
make
an
additional
example
in
that
excellent
book
call
God
's
revenge
against
murder
;
and
doubt
not
but
he
would
(
at
least
in
his
present
necessity
)
agree
without
scruple
to
a
simple
robbery
,
especially
where
any
considerable
booty
should
be
propose
,
and
the
safety
of
the
attack
plausibly
make
appear
;
which
if
he
could
prevail
on
him
to
undertake
,
he
would
immediately
afterwards
get
him
impeach
,
convict
,
and
hang
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
therefore
have
discharge
his
duty
to
Hymen
,
and
hear
that
Heartfree
have
procure
himself
the
liberty
of
the
Fleet
,
than
he
resolve
to
visit
him
,
and
to
propose
a
robbery
with
all
the
allurement
of
profit
,
ease
,
and
safety
.
  
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
no
sooner
make
than
it
be
answer
by
Heartfree
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
hope
the
answer
which
I
give
to
your
former
advice
would
have
prevent
me
from
the
danger
of
receive
a
second
affront
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
an
affront
I
call
it
,
and
surely
,
if
it
be
so
to
call
a
man
a
villain
,
it
can
be
no
less
to
shew
him
<EOS>
you
suppose
him
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
may
be
wonder
how
any
man
can
arrive
at
the
boldness
,
I
may
say
impudence
,
of
first
make
such
an
overture
to
another
;
surely
it
be
seldom
do
,
unless
to
those
who
have
previously
betray
some
symptom
of
their
own
baseness
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
therefore
shew
you
any
such
,
these
insult
be
more
pardonable
;
but
I
assure
you
,
if
such
appear
,
they
discharge
all
their
malignance
outwardly
,
and
reflect
not
even
a
shadow
within
;
for
to
me
baseness
seem
inconsistent
with
this
rule
,
of
do
no
other
person
an
injury
from
any
motive
<EOS>
or
on
any
consideration
whatever
.
<EOS>
this
,
sir
,
be
the
rule
by
which
I
be
determined
to
walk
,
nor
can
that
man
justify
disbelieve
me
who
will
not
own
<EOS>
he
walk
not
by
it
himself
.
<EOS>
but
,
whether
it
be
allow
to
me
or
no
,
or
whether
I
feel
the
good
effect
of
its
be
practise
by
other
,
I
be
resolve
to
maintain
it
;
for
surely
no
man
can
reap
a
benefit
from
my
pursuing
it
equal
to
the
comfort
I
myself
enjoy
:
for
what
a
ravish
thought
,
how
replete
with
extasy
,
must
the
consideration
be
,
that
Almighty
Goodness
be
by
its
own
nature
engage
to
reward
me
!
<EOS>
how
indifferent
must
such
a
persuasion
make
a
man
to
all
the
occurrence
of
this
life
!
<EOS>
what
trifle
must
he
represent
to
himself
both
the
enjoyment
and
the
affliction
of
this
world
!
<EOS>
how
easily
must
he
acquiesce
under
miss
the
former
,
and
how
patiently
will
he
submit
to
the
latter
,
who
be
convinced
that
his
failing
of
a
transitory
imperfect
reward
here
be
a
most
certain
argument
of
his
obtain
one
permanent
and
complete
hereafter
!
<EOS>
dost
thou
think
then
,
thou
little
,
paltry
,
mean
animal
<EOS>
(
with
such
language
do
he
treat
our
truly
great
man
)
,
that
I
will
forego
such
comfortable
expectation
for
any
pitiful
reward
which
thou
canst
suggest
or
promise
to
me
;
for
that
sordid
lucre
for
which
all
pain
and
labour
be
undertake
by
the
industrious
,
and
all
barbarity
and
iniquity
commit
by
the
vile
;
for
a
worthless
acquisition
,
which
such
as
thou
art
can
possess
,
can
give
,
or
can
take
away
?
<EOS>
"
the
former
part
of
this
speech
occasion
much
yawning
in
our
hero
,
but
the
latter
rouse
his
anger
;
and
he
be
collect
his
rage
to
answer
,
when
Friendly
and
the
constable
,
who
have
be
summon
by
Heartfree
on
Wild
's
first
appearance
,
enter
the
room
,
and
seize
the
great
man
just
as
his
wrath
be
burst
from
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
the
dialogue
which
now
ensue
be
not
worth
relate
:
Wild
be
soon
acquaint
with
the
reason
of
this
rough
treatment
,
and
presently
convey
before
a
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
doubt
raise
by
Mr.
Wild
's
lawyer
on
his
examination
,
he
insist
that
the
proceeding
be
improper
,
for
that
a
writ
de
homine
replegiando
should
issue
,
and
on
the
return
of
that
a
capias
in
withernam
,
the
justice
incline
to
commitment
,
so
that
Wild
be
drive
to
other
method
for
his
defence
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
acquaint
the
justice
that
there
be
a
young
man
likewise
with
him
in
the
boat
,
and
beg
that
he
may
be
send
for
,
which
request
be
accordingly
grant
,
and
the
faithful
Achates
(
Mr.
Fireblood
)
be
soon
produce
to
bear
testimony
for
his
friend
,
which
he
do
with
so
much
become
zeal
,
and
go
through
his
examination
with
such
coherence
(
though
he
be
force
to
collect
his
evidence
from
the
hint
give
him
by
Wild
in
the
presence
of
the
justice
and
the
accuser
)
,
that
,
as
here
be
direct
evidence
against
mere
presumption
,
our
hero
be
most
honourably
acquit
,
and
poor
Heartfree
be
charge
by
the
justice
,
the
audience
,
and
all
other
who
afterwards
hear
the
story
,
with
the
black
ingratitude
,
in
attempt
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
to
whom
he
have
such
eminent
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
lest
so
vast
an
effort
of
friendship
as
this
of
Fireblood
's
should
too
violently
surprize
the
reader
in
this
degenerate
age
,
it
may
be
proper
to
inform
him
that
,
beside
the
tie
of
engagement
in
the
same
employ
,
another
nearer
and
strong
alliance
subsist
between
our
hero
and
this
youth
,
which
latter
be
just
depart
from
the
arm
of
the
lovely
Laetitia
when
he
receive
her
husband
's
message
;
an
instance
which
may
also
serve
to
justify
those
strict
intercourse
of
love
and
acquaintance
which
so
commonly
subsist
in
modern
history
between
the
husband
and
gallant
,
display
the
vast
force
of
friendship
contract
by
this
more
honourable
than
legal
alliance
,
which
be
think
to
be
at
present
one
of
the
strong
bond
of
amity
between
great
man
,
and
the
most
reputable
as
well
as
easy
way
to
their
favour
.
  
<EOS>
four
month
have
now
pass
since
Heartfree
's
first
confinement
,
and
his
affair
have
begin
to
wear
a
more
benign
aspect
;
but
they
be
a
good
deal
injure
by
this
attempt
on
Wild
<EOS>
(
so
dangerous
be
any
attack
on
a
great
MAN
)
,
several
of
his
neighbour
,
and
particularly
one
or
two
of
his
own
trade
,
industriously
endeavour
,
from
their
bitter
animosity
against
such
kind
of
iniquity
,
to
spread
and
exaggerate
his
ingratitude
as
much
as
possible
;
not
in
the
least
scrupling
,
in
the
violent
ardour
of
their
indignation
,
to
add
some
small
circumstance
of
their
own
knowledge
of
the
many
obligation
confer
on
Heartfree
by
Wild
.
<EOS>
to
all
these
scandal
he
quietly
submit
,
comfort
himself
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
innocence
,
and
confide
in
time
,
the
sure
friend
of
justice
,
to
acquit
him
.
   
<EOS>
a
scheme
<EOS>
so
DEEPLY
LAID
,
that
it
shame
all
the
politic
of
this
our
age
;
with
digression
and
subdigression
.
 
<EOS>
wild
have
now
,
to
the
hatred
he
bear
Heartfree
on
account
of
those
injury
he
have
do
him
,
an
additional
spur
from
this
injury
receive
(
for
so
it
appear
to
him
,
who
,
no
more
than
the
most
ignorant
,
consider
how
truly
he
deserve
it
)
,
apply
his
utmost
industry
to
accomplish
the
ruin
of
one
whose
very
name
sound
odious
in
his
ear
;
when
luckily
a
scheme
arise
in
his
imagination
which
not
only
promise
to
effect
it
securely
,
but
(
which
please
him
most
)
by
mean
of
the
mischief
he
have
already
do
him
;
and
which
would
at
once
load
him
with
the
imputation
of
have
commit
what
he
himself
have
do
to
him
,
and
would
bring
on
him
the
severe
punishment
for
a
fact
of
which
he
be
not
only
innocent
,
but
have
already
so
greatly
suffer
by
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
no
other
than
to
charge
him
with
have
convey
away
his
wife
,
with
his
most
valuable
effect
,
in
order
to
defraud
his
creditor
.
  
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
start
this
thought
than
he
immediately
resolve
on
put
it
in
execution
.
<EOS>
what
remain
to
consider
be
only
the
quomodo
,
and
the
person
or
tool
to
be
employ
;
for
the
stage
of
the
world
differ
from
that
in
Drury
-
lane
principally
in
this
 
that
whereas
,
on
the
latter
,
the
hero
or
chief
figure
be
almost
continually
before
your
eye
,
whilst
the
under
-
actor
be
not
see
above
once
in
an
evening
;
now
,
on
the
former
,
the
hero
or
great
man
be
always
behind
the
curtain
,
and
seldom
or
never
appear
or
doth
anything
in
his
own
person
.
<EOS>
He
doth
indeed
,
in
this
GRAND
DRAMA
,
rather
perform
the
part
of
the
prompter
,
and
doth
instruct
the
well
-
dr
figure
,
who
be
strut
in
public
on
the
stage
,
<EOS>
what
to
say
and
do
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
a
puppet
-
show
will
illustrate
our
meaning
better
,
where
it
be
the
master
of
the
show
(
the
great
man
)
who
dance
and
move
everything
,
whether
it
be
the
king
of
Muscovy
or
whatever
other
potentate
<EOS>
alias
puppet
which
we
behold
on
the
stage
;
but
he
himself
keep
wisely
out
of
sight
:
for
,
should
he
once
appear
,
the
whole
motion
would
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
not
that
any
one
be
ignorant
of
his
be
there
,
or
suppose
that
the
puppet
be
not
mere
stick
of
wood
,
and
he
himself
the
sole
mover
;
but
as
this
(
though
every
one
know
it
)
<EOS>
doth
not
appear
visibly
,
i.e.
,
to
their
eye
,
no
one
be
ashamed
of
consent
to
be
impose
upon
;
of
help
on
the
drama
,
by
call
the
several
stick
or
puppet
by
the
name
which
the
master
hath
allot
to
them
,
and
by
assign
to
each
the
character
which
the
great
man
be
pleased
they
shall
move
in
,
or
rather
in
which
he
himself
be
pleased
to
move
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
to
suppose
thee
,
gentle
reader
,
one
of
very
little
knowledge
in
this
world
,
to
imagine
them
hast
never
see
some
of
these
puppet
-
show
which
be
so
frequently
act
on
the
great
stage
;
but
though
thou
shouldst
have
reside
all
thy
day
in
those
remote
part
of
this
island
which
great
man
seldom
visit
,
yet
,
if
thou
hast
any
penetration
,
thou
must
have
have
some
occasion
to
admire
both
the
solemnity
of
countenance
in
the
actor
and
the
gravity
in
the
spectator
,
while
some
of
those
farce
be
carry
on
which
be
act
almost
daily
in
every
village
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
a
very
despicable
opinion
of
mankind
indeed
who
can
conceive
them
to
be
impose
on
as
often
as
they
appear
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
they
be
in
the
same
situation
with
the
reader
of
romance
;
who
,
though
they
know
the
whole
to
be
one
entire
fiction
,
nevertheless
agree
to
be
deceive
;
and
,
as
these
find
amusement
,
so
do
the
other
find
ease
and
convenience
in
this
concurrence
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
be
a
subdigression
,
I
return
to
my
digression
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
man
ought
to
do
his
business
by
other
;
to
employ
hand
,
as
we
have
before
say
,
to
his
purpose
,
and
keep
himself
as
much
behind
the
curtain
as
possible
;
and
though
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
two
very
great
man
,
whose
name
will
be
both
record
in
history
,
do
in
these
latter
time
come
forth
themselves
on

rather
as

<EOS>
to
return
to
my
history
,
which
,
have
rest
itself
a
little
,
be
now
ready
to
proceed
on
its
journey
:
fireblood
be
the
person
choose
by
Wild
for
this
service
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
on
a
late
occasion
,
experience
the
talent
of
this
youth
for
a
good
round
perjury
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
,
therefore
,
find
him
out
,
and
propose
it
to
him
;
when
,
receive
his
instant
assent
,
they
consult
together
,
and
soon
frame
an
evidence
,
which
,
be
communicate
to
one
of
the
most
bitter
and
severe
creditor
of
Heartfree
,
by
him
lay
before
a
magistrate
,
and
attest
by
the
oath
of
Fireblood
,
the
justice
grant
his
warrant
:
and
Heartfree
be
accordingly
apprehend
and
bring
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
officer
come
for
this
poor
wretch
they
find
him
meanly
divert
himself
with
his
little
child
,
the
young
of
whom
sit
on
his
knee
,
and
the
elder
be
play
at
a
little
distance
from
him
with
Friendly
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
officer
,
who
be
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
,
but
one
very
laudably
severe
in
his
office
,
after
acquaint
Heartfree
with
his
errand
,
bad
him
come
along
and
be
d
 
d
,
and
leave
those
little
bastard
,
for
so
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
he
suppose
they
be
,
for
a
legacy
to
the
parish
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
be
much
surprize
at
hear
there
be
a
warrant
for
felony
against
him
;
but
he
shew
less
concern
than
Friendly
do
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
elder
daughter
,
when
she
see
the
officer
lie
hold
on
her
father
,
immediately
quit
her
play
,
and
,
run
to
him
and
burst
into
tear
,
cry
out
,
"
You
shall
not
hurt
poor
papa
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
other
ruffian
offer
to
take
the
little
one
rudely
from
his
knee
;
but
Heartfree
start
up
,
and
,
catch
the
fellow
by
the
collar
,
dash
his
head
so
violently
against
the
wall
,
that
,
have
he
have
any
brain
,
he
may
possibly
have
lose
them
by
the
blow
.
  
<EOS>
the
officer
,
like
most
of
those
heroic
spirit
who
insult
man
in
adversity
,
have
some
prudence
mixt
with
his
zeal
for
justice
.
<EOS>
seeing
,
therefore
,
this
rough
treatment
of
his
companion
,
he
begin
to
pursue
more
gentle
method
,
and
very
civilly
desire
Mr.
Heartfree
to
go
with
him
,
see
he
be
an
officer
,
and
oblige
to
execute
his
warrant
;
that
he
be
sorry
for
his
misfortune
,
and
hope
he
would
be
acquit
.
<EOS>
the
other
answer
,
"
He
should
patiently
submit
to
the
law
of
his
country
,
and
would
attend
him
whither
he
be
order
to
conduct
him
;
"
then
,
take
leave
of
his
child
with
a
tender
kiss
,
he
recommend
them
to
the
care
of
Friendly
,
who
promise
to
see
them
safe
home
,
and
then
to
attend
him
at
the
justice
's
,
whose
name
and
abode
he
have
learn
of
the
constable
.
  
<EOS>
Friendly
arrive
at
the
magistrate
's
house
just
as
that
gentleman
have
sign
the
mittimus
against
his
friend
;
for
the
evidence
of
Fireblood
be
so
clear
and
strong
,
and
the
justice
be
so
incensed
against
Heartfree
,
and
so
convinced
of
his
guilt
,
that
he
would
hardly
hear
him
speak
in
his
own
defence
,
which
the
reader
perhaps
,
when
he
hear
the
evidence
against
him
,
will
be
less
inclined
to
censure
:
for
this
witness
depose
,
"
that
he
have
be
,
by
Heartfree
himself
,
employ
to
carry
the
order
of
embezzle
to
Wild
,
in
order
to
be
deliver
to
his
wife
:
that
he
have
be
afterwards
present
with
Wild
and
her
at
the
inn
when
they
take
coach
for
Harwich
,
where
she
shew
him
the
casket
of
jewel
,
and
desire
him
to
tell
her
husband
that
she
have
fully
execute
his
command
;
"
and
this
he
swear
to
have
be
do
after
Heartfree
have
notice
of
the
commission
,
and
,
in
order
to
bring
it
within
that
time
,
Fireblood
,
as
well
as
Wild
,
<EOS>
swear
that
Mrs.
Heartfree
lie
several
day
conceal
at
Wild
's
house
before
her
departure
for
Holland
.
  
<EOS>
when
Friendly
find
the
justice
obdurate
,
and
that
all
he
could
say
have
no
effect
,
nor
be
it
any
way
possible
for
Heartfree
to
escape
be
commit
to
Newgate
,
he
resolve
to
accompany
him
thither
;
where
,
when
they
arrive
,
the
turnkey
would
have
confine
Heartfree
(
he
have
no
money
)
amongst
the
common
felon
;
but
Friendly
would
not
permit
it
,
and
advance
every
shilling
he
have
in
his
pocket
,
to
procure
a
room
in
the
press
-
yard
for
his
friend
,
which
indeed
,
through
the
humanity
of
the
keeper
,
he
do
at
a
cheap
rate
.
  
<EOS>
They
spend
that
day
together
,
and
in
the
evening
the
prisoner
dismiss
his
friend
,
desire
him
,
after
many
thank
for
his
fidelity
,
to
be
comfort
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
far
the
malice
of
my
enemy
may
prevail
;
but
whatever
my
suffering
be
,
I
be
convince
my
innocence
will
somewhere
be
reward
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
any
fatal
accident
should
happen
to
me
(
for
he
who
be
in
the
hand
of
perjury
may
apprehend
the
worst
)
,
my
dear
Friendly
,
be
a
father
to
my
poor
child
;
"
at
which
word
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
other
beg
him
not
to
admit
any
such
apprehension
,
for
that
he
would
employ
his
utmost
diligence
in
his
service
,
and
doubt
not
but
to
subvert
any
villanous
design
lay
for
his
destruction
,
and
to
make
his
innocence
appear
to
the
world
as
white
as
it
be
in
his
own
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
We
can
not
help
mention
a
circumstance
here
,
though
we
doubt
it
will
appear
very
unnatural
and
incredible
to
our
reader
;
which
be
,
that
,
notwithstanding
the
former
character
and
behaviour
of
Heartfree
,
this
story
of
his
embezzling
be
so
far
from
surprize
his
neighbour
,
that
many
of
them
declare
they
expect
no
well
from
him
.
<EOS>
some
be
assure
he
could
pay
forty
shilling
in
the
pound
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
other
have
overhear
hint
formerly
pass
between
him
and
Mrs.
Heartfree
which
have
give
them
suspicion
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
most
astonishing
of
all
be
,
that
many
of
those
who
have
before
censure
him
for
an
extravagant
heedless
fool
<EOS>
,
now
no
less
confidently
abuse
him
for
a
cunning
,
tricking
,
avaricious
knave
.
   
<EOS>
something
concern
fireblood
which
WILL
surprize
;
and
somewhat
touch
one
of
the
MISS
SNAPS
,
which
WILL
GREATLY
concern
the
READER
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
notwithstanding
all
these
censure
abroad
,
and
in
despight
of
all
his
misfortune
at
home
,
Heartfree
in
Newgate
enjoy
a
quiet
,
undisturbed
repose
;
while
our
hero
,
nobly
disdain
rest
,
lie
sleepless
all
night
,
partly
from
the
apprehension
of
Mrs.
Heartfree
's
return
before
he
have
execute
his
scheme
,
and
partly
from
a
suspicion
lest
fireblood
should
betray
him
;
of
whose
infidelity
he
have
,
nevertheless
,
no
other
cause
to
maintain
any
fear
,
but
from
his
know
him
to
be
an
accomplished
rascal
,
as
the
vulgar
term
it
,
a
complete
GREAT
MAN
in
our
language
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
these
doubt
be
not
without
some
foundation
;
for
the
very
same
thought
unluckily
enter
the
head
of
that
noble
youth
,
who
consider
whether
he
may
not
possibly
sell
himself
for
some
advantage
to
the
other
side
,
as
he
have
yet
no
promise
from
Wild
;
but
this
be
,
by
the
sagacity
of
the
latter
,
prevent
in
the
morning
with
a
profusion
of
promise
,
which
shew
him
to
be
of
the
most
generous
temper
in
the
world
,
with
which
Fireblood
be
extremely
well
satisfied
,
and
make
use
of
so
many
protestation
of
his
faithfulness
that
he
convince
Wild
of
the
justice
of
his
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
an
accident
happen
,
which
,
though
it
do
not
immediately
affect
our
hero
,
we
can
not
avoid
relate
,
as
it
occasion
great
confusion
in
his
family
,
as
well
as
in
the
family
of
Snap
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
calamity
highly
to
be
lament
,
when
it
stain
untainted
blood
,
and
happen
to
an
honourable
house
 
an
injury
never
to
be
repair
 
a
blot
never
to
be
wipe
out
 
a
sore
never
to
be
heal
.
<EOS>
to
detain
my
reader
no
longer
,
Miss
Theodosia
Snap
be
now
safely
deliver
of
a
male
infant
,
the
product
of
an
amour
which
that
beautiful
(
o
that
I
could
say
virtuous
!
)
<EOS>
creature
have
with
the
count
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
and
his
lady
be
at
breakfast
when
Mr.
Snap
,
with
all
the
agony
of
despair
both
in
his
voice
and
countenance
,
bring
them
this
melancholy
news
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
who
have
(
as
we
have
say
)
wonderful
good
-
nature
when
his
greatness
or
interest
be
not
concern
,
instead
of
revile
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
ask
with
a
smile
,
"
who
be
the
father
?
"
<EOS>
but
the
chaste
Laetitia
,
we
repeat
the
chaste
,
for
well
do
she
now
deserve
that
epithet
,
receive
it
in
another
manner
.
<EOS>
She
fall
into
the
utmost
fury
at
the
relation
,
revile
her
sister
in
the
bitter
term
,
and
vow
she
would
never
see
nor
speak
to
her
more
;
then
burst
into
tear
and
lament
over
her
father
that
such
dishonour
should
ever
happen
to
him
and
herself
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
fall
severely
on
her
husband
for
the
light
treatment
which
he
give
this
fatal
accident
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
he
be
unworthy
of
the
honour
he
enjoy
of
marry
into
a
chaste
family
.
<EOS>
that
she
look
on
it
as
an
affront
to
her
virtue
.
<EOS>
that
if
he
have
marry
one
of
the
naughty
hussy
of
the
town
he
could
have
behave
to
her
in
no
other
manner
.
<EOS>
She
conclude
with
desire
her
father
to
make
an
example
of
the
slut
,
and
to
turn
her
out
of
door
;
for
that
she
would
not
otherwise
enter
his
house
,
be
resolve
never
to
set
her
foot
within
the
same
threshold
with
the
trollop
,
whom
she
detest
so
much
the
more
because
(
which
be
perhaps
true
)
<EOS>
she
be
her
own
sister
.
  
<EOS>
so
violent
,
and
indeed
so
outrageous
,
be
this
chaste
lady
's
love
of
virtue
,
that
she
could
not
forgive
a
single
slip
(
indeed
the
only
one
Theodosia
have
ever
make
)
in
her
own
sister
,
in
a
sister
who
love
her
,
and
to
whom
she
owe
a
thousand
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
severity
of
Mr.
Snap
,
who
greatly
feel
the
injury
do
to
the
honour
of
his
family
,
would
have
relent
,
have
not
the
parish
-
officer
be
extremely
pressing
on
this
occasion
,
and
for
want
of
security
,
convey
the
unhappy
young
lady
to
a
place
,
the
name
of
which
,
for
the
honour
of
the
Snaps
,
to
whom
our
hero
be
so
nearly
ally
,
we
bury
in
eternal
oblivion
;
where
she
suffer
so
much
correction
for
her
crime
,
that
the
good
-
natured
reader
of
the
male
kind
may
be
incline
to
compassionate
her
,
at
least
to
imagine
she
be
sufficiently
punish
for
a
fault
which
,
with
submission
to
the
chaste
Laetitia
and
all
other
strictly
virtuous
lady
,
it
should
be
either
less
criminal
in
a
woman
to
commit
,
or
more
so
in
a
man
to
solicit
her
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
our
hero
,
who
be
a
living
and
strong
instance
that
human
greatness
and
happiness
be
not
always
inseparable
.
<EOS>
He
be
under
a
continual
alarm
of
fright
,
and
fear
,
and
jealousy
.
<EOS>
He
think
every
man
he
behold
wear
a
knife
for
his
throat
,
and
a
pair
of
scissar
for
his
purse
.
<EOS>
as
for
his
own
gang
particularly
,
he
be
thoroughly
convinced
there
be
not
a
single
man
amongst
them
who
would
not
,
for
the
value
of
five
shilling
,
bring
him
to
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
these
apprehension
so
constantly
break
his
rest
,
and
keep
him
so
assiduously
on
his
guard
to
frustrate
and
circumvent
any
design
which
may
be
form
against
him
,
that
his
condition
,
to
any
other
than
the
glorious
eye
of
ambition
,
may
seem
rather
deplorable
than
the
object
of
envy
or
desire
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
our
hero
make
<EOS>
a
speech
<EOS>
well
worthy
<EOS>
to
be
CELEBRATED
;
and
the
behaviour
of
one
of
the
GANG
,
<EOS>
PERHAPS
MORE
unnatural
than
any
other
part
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
in
the
gang
a
man
name
Blueskin
,
one
of
those
merchant
who
trade
in
dead
oxen
,
sheep
,
&
c.
,
in
short
,
what
the
vulgar
call
a
butcher
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
two
quality
of
a
great
man
,
viz
.
,
undaunted
courage
,
and
an
absolute
contempt
of
those
ridiculous
distinction
of
meum
and
tuum
,
which
would
cause
endless
dispute
do
not
the
law
happily
decide
them
by
convert
both
into
suum
.
<EOS>
the
common
form
of
exchange
property
by
trade
seem
to
him
too
tedious
;
he
therefore
resolve
to
quit
the
mercantile
profession
,
and
,
fall
acquaint
with
some
of
Mr.
Wild
's
people
,
he
provide
himself
with
arm
,
and
enlist
of
the
gang
;
in
which
he
behave
for
some
time
with
great
decency
and
order
,
and
submit
to
accept
such
share
of
the
booty
with
the
rest
as
our
hero
allot
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
subserviency
agree
ill
with
his
temper
;
for
we
should
have
before
remember
a
third
heroic
quality
,
namely
,
ambition
,
which
be
no
inconsiderable
part
of
his
composition
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
therefore
,
have
rob
a
gentleman
at
Windsor
of
a
gold
watch
,
which
,
on
its
be
advertise
in
the
newspaper
,
with
a
considerable
reward
,
be
demand
of
him
by
Wild
,
he
peremptorily
refuse
to
deliver
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
Mr.
Blueskin
!
<EOS>
"
say
Wild
;
"
you
will
not
deliver
the
watch
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"

I

sure

reply
Wild
,
"
you
have
not
the
assurance
to
pretend
you
have
any
property
or
right
in
this
watch

<EOS>
"
I
be
certain
,

return
Blueskin
,
"
whether
I
have
any
right
in
it

no

you
can
prove
none

"
<EOS>
"
I
will
undertake
,

cry
the
other
,
"
to
shew
I
have
an
absolute
right
to
it
,
and
that
by
the
law
of
our
gang
,
of
which
I
be
providentially
at
the
head
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
who
put
you
at
the
head
of
it
,
"
cry
Blueskin
;
"
but
those
who
do
certainly
do
it
for
their
own
good
,
that
you
may
conduct
them
the
well
in
their
robbery
,
inform
them
of
the
rich
bootie
,
prevent
surprize
,
pack
jury
,
bribe
evidence
,
and
so
contribute
to
their
benefit
and
safety
;
and
not
to
convert
all
their
labour
and
hazard
to
your
own
benefit
and
advantage
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
be
greatly
mistaken
,
sir
,
"
answer
Wild
;
"
you
be
talk
of
a
legal
society
,
where
the
chief
magistrate
be
always
choose
for
the
public
good
,
which
,
as
we
see
in
all
the
legal
society
of
the
world
,
he
constantly
consult
,
daily
contributing
,
by
his
superior
skill
,
to
their
prosperity
,
and
not
sacrifice
their
good
to
his
own
wealth
,
or
pleasure
,
or
humour
:
<EOS>
but
in
an
illegal
society
or
gang
,
as
this
of
ours
,
it
be
otherwise
;
for
who
would
be
at
the
head
of
a
gang
,
unless
for
his
own
interest
?
<EOS>
and
without
a
head
,
you
know
,
you
can
not
subsist
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
head
,
and
obedience
to
that
head
,
can
preserve
a
gang
a
moment
from
destruction
.
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
well
for
you
to
content
yourself
with
a
moderate
reward
,
and
enjoy
that
in
safety
at
the
disposal
of
your
chief
,
than
to
engross
the
whole
with
the
hazard
to
which
you
will
be
liable
without
his
protection
.
<EOS>
and
surely
there
be
none
in
the
whole
gang
who
hath
less
reason
to
complain
than
you
;
you
have
taste
of
my
favour
:
witness
that
piece
of
ribbon
you
wear
in
your
hat
,
with
which
I
dub
you
captain
.
<EOS>
therefore
pray
,
captain
,
deliver
the
watch
.
"
<EOS>
"
D####n
your
cajoling
,
"
say
Blueskin
:
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
value
myself
on
this
bit
of
ribbon
,
which
I
could
have
buy
myself
for
sixpence
,
and
have
wear
without
your
leave
?
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
I
think
myself
a
captain
because
you
,
whom
I
know
not
empower
to
make
one
,
call
me
so
?
<EOS>
the
name
of
captain
be
but
a
shadow
:
<EOS>
the
man
and
the
salary
be
the
substance
;
and
I
be
not
to
be
bubble
with
a
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
call
captain
no
longer
,
and
he
who
flatter
me
by
that
name
<EOS>
I
shall
think
affront
me
,
and
I
will
knock
him
down
,
I
assure
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
ever
man
talk
so
unreasonably
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
not
respect
as
a
captain
by
the
whole
gang
since
my
dub
you
so
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
shadow
<EOS>
only
,
it
seem
;
and
you
will
knock
a
man
down
for
affront
you
who
call
you
captain
!
<EOS>
may
not
a
man
as
reasonably
tell
a
minister
of
state
,
Sir
,
you
have
give
me
the
shadow
only
?
<EOS>
the
ribbon
or
the
bauble
that
you
give
me
imply
that
I
have
either
signalise
myself
,
by
some
great
action
,
for
the
benefit
and
glory
of
my
country
,
or
at
least
that
I
be
descend
from
those
who
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
know
myself
to
be
a
scoundrel
,
and
so
have
be
those
few
ancestor
I
can
remember
,
or
have
ever
hear
of

<EOS>
therefore
,
I
be
resolve
to
knock
the
first
man
down
who
call
me

but
all
great

think
themselves
sufficiently
repay
by
what
procure
them
honour

precedence
in

without
enquire
into
substance
;
nay
,
if
a
title
or
a
feather
be
equal
to
this
purpose
,
they
be
substance
,
and
not
mere
shadow

<EOS>
but
I
have
not
time
to
argue
with
you
at
present
,
so
give
me
the
watch
without
any
more
deliberation
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
more
a
friend
to
deliberation
than
yourself

answer
Blueskin
,
"
and
<EOS>
so
I
tell
you
,
once
for
all
,
by
g
#

I
never

give
you
the

no

I
ever
hereafter
surrender
any

my
booty
.
<EOS>
I
win
it

and
I
will
wear
it

<EOS>
take
your
pistol
yourself
,
and
go
out
on
the
highway
,
and
do
not
lazily
think
to
fatten
yourself
with
the
danger
and
pain
of
other
people
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
depart
in
a
fierce
mood
,
and
repair
to
the
tavern
use
by
the
gang
,
where
he
have
appoint
to
meet
some
of
his
acquaintance
,
whom
he
inform
of
what
have
pass
between
him
and
Wild
,
and
advise
them
all
to
follow
his
example
;
which
they
all
readily
agree
to
,
and
Mr.
Wild
's
d
 
tion
be
the
universal
toast
;
in
drink
bumper
to
which
they
have
finish
a
large
bowl
of
punch
,
when
a
constable
,
with
a
numerous
attendance
,
and
Wild
at
their
head
,
enter
the
room
and
seize
on
Blueskin
,
whom
his
companion
,
when
they
see
our
hero
,
do
not
dare
attempt
to
rescue
.
<EOS>
the
watch
be
find
upon
him
,
which
,
together
with
Wild
's
information
,
be
more
than
sufficient
to
commit
him
to
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
Wild
and
the
rest
of
those
who
have
be
drink
with
Blueskin
meet
at
the
tavern
,
where
nothing
be
to
be
see
but
the
profound
submission
to
their
leader
.
<EOS>
They
vilify
and
abuse
Blueskin
,
as
much
as
they
have
before
abuse
our
hero
,
and
now
repeat
the
same
toast
,
only
change
the
name
of
Wild
into
that
of
Blueskin
;
all
agree
with
Wild
that
the
watch
find
in
his
pocket
,
and
which
must
be
a
fatal
evidence
against
him
,
be
a
just
judgment
on
his
disobedience
and
revolt
.
  
<EOS>
thus
do
this
great
man
by
a
resolute
and
timely
example
(
for
he
go
directly
to
the
justice
when
Blueskin
leave
him
)
<EOS>
quell
one
of
the
most
dangerous
conspiracy
which
could
possibly
arise
in
a
gang
,
and
which
,
have
it
be
permit
one
day
's
growth
,
would
inevitably
have
end
in
his
destruction
;
so
much
doth
it
behove
all
great
man
to
be
eternally
on
their
guard
,
and
expeditious
in
the
execution
of
their
purpose
;
while
none
but
the
weak
and
honest
can
indulge
themselves
in
remissness
or
repose
.
  
<EOS>
the
Achates
,
Fireblood
,
have
be
present
at
both
these
meeting
;
but
,
though
he
have
a
little
too
hastily
concur
in
curse
his
friend
,
and
in
vow
his
perdition
,
yet
now
he
see
all
that
scheme
dissolve
<EOS>
he
return
to
his
integrity
,
of
which
he
give
an
incontestable
proof
,
by
inform
Wild
of
the
measure
which
have
be
concert
against
him
,
in
which
he
say
he
have
pretend
to
acquiesce
,
in
order
the
well
to
betray
them
;
but
this
,
as
he
afterwards
confess
on
his
deathbed
at
Tyburn
,
be
only
a
copy
of
his
countenance
;
for
that
he
be
,
at
that
time
,
as
sincere
and
hearty
in
his
opposition
to
Wild
as
any
of
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
receive
Fireblood
's
information
with
a
very
placid
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
as
the
gang
have
see
their
error
,
and
repent
,
nothing
be
more
noble
than
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
he
be
please
modestly
to
ascribe
this
to
his
lenity
,
it
really
arise
from
much
more
noble
and
political
principle
.
<EOS>
He
consider
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
attempt
the
punishment
of
so
many
;
besides
,
he
flatter
himself
that
fear
would
keep
them
in
order
:
and
indeed
Fireblood
have
tell
him
nothing
more
than
he
know
before
,
viz
.
,
that
they
be
all
complete
prig
,
whom
he
be
to
govern
by
their
fear
,
and
in
whom
he
be
to
place
no
more
confidence
than
be
necessary
,
and
to
watch
them
with
the
utmost
caution
and
circumspection
:
for
a
rogue
,
he
wisely
say
,
like
gunpowder
,
must
be
use
with
caution
;
since
both
be
altogether
as
liable
to
blow
up
the
party
himself
who
use
them
as
to
execute
his
mischievous
purpose
against
some
other
person
or
animal
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
repair
to
Newgate
,
it
be
the
place
where
most
of
the
great
man
of
this
history
be
hasten
as
fast
as
possible
;
and
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
it
be
a
castle
very
far
from
be
an
improper
or
misbecoming
habitation
for
any
great
man
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
and
as
this
scene
will
continue
during
the
residue
of
our
history
,
we
shall
open
it
with
a
new
book
,
and
shall
therefore
take
this
opportunity
of
close
our
third

<EOS>
BOOK
IV
   
sentiment
of
the
ORDINARY
'S
,
WORTHY
<EOS>
to
be
WRITTEN
in
letter
of
gold
;
<EOS>
a
very
extraordinary
INSTANCE
of
FOLLY
in
FRIENDLY
,
and
a
dreadful
ACCIDENT
which
BEFEL
our
hero
.
 
<EOS>
Heartfree
have
not
be
long
in
Newgate
before
his
frequent
conversation
with
his
child
,
and
other
instance
of
a
good
heart
,
which
betray
themselves
in
his
action
and
conversation
,
create
an
opinion
in
all
about
him
that
he
be
one
of
the
silly
fellow
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
the
ordinary
himself
,
a
very
sagacious
as
well
as
very
worthy
person
,
declare
that
he
be
a
cursed
rogue
,
but
no
conjuror
.
  
<EOS>
what
indeed
may
induce
the
former
,
i.e.
the
roguish
part
of
this
opinion
in
the
ordinary
,
be
a
wicked
sentiment
which
Heartfree
one
day
disclose
in
conversation
,
and
which
we
,
who
be
truly
orthodox
,
will
not
pretend
to
justify
,
that
he
believe
a
sincere
Turk
would
be
save
.
<EOS>
to
this
the
good
man
,
with
become
zeal
and
indignation
,
answer
,
I
know
not
what
may
become
of
a
sincere
Turk
;
but
,
if
this
be
your
persuasion
,
I
pronounce
it
impossible
you
should
be
save
.
<EOS>
no
,
sir
;
so
far
from
a
sincere
Turk
's
be
within
the
pale
of
salvation
,
neither
will
any
sincere
Presbyterian
,
Anabaptist
,
nor
Quaker
whatever
,
be
save
.
  
<EOS>
but
neither
do
the
one
nor
the
other
part
of
this
character
prevail
on
Friendly
to
abandon
his
old
master
.
<EOS>
He
spend
his
whole
time
with
him
,
except
only
those
hour
when
he
be
absent
for
his
sake
,
in
procure
evidence
for
him
against
his
trial
,
which
be
now
shortly
to
come
on
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
young
man
be
the
only
comfort
,
besides
a
clear
conscience
and
the
hope
beyond
the
grave
,
which
this
poor
wretch
have
;
for
the
sight
of
his
child
be
like
one
of
those
alluring
pleasure
which
man
in
some
disease
indulge
themselves
often
fatally
in
,
which
at
once
flat
and
heighten
their
malady
.
  
<EOS>
friendly
be
one
day
present
while
Heartfree
be
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
embrace
his
eld
daughter
,
and
lament
the
hard
fate
to
which
he
fear
he
should
be
oblige
to
leave
her
,
speak
to
him
thus
:
"
I
have
long
observe
with
admiration
the
magnanimity
with
which
you
go
through
your
own
misfortune
,
and
the
steady
countenance
with
which
you
look
on
death
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
that
all
your
agony
arise
from
the
thought
of
part
with
your
child
,
and
of
leave
them
in
a
distrest
condition
;
now
,
though
I
hope
all
your
fear
will
prove
ill
ground
,
yet
,
that
I
may
relieve
you
as
much
as
possible
from
them
,
be
assure
that
,
as
nothing
can
give
me
more
real
misery
than
to
observe
so
tender
and
love
a
concern
in
a
master
,
to
whose
goodness
I
owe
so
many
obligation
,
and
whom
I
so
sincerely
love
,
so
nothing
can
afford
me
equal
pleasure
with
my
contributing
to
lessen
or
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
be
convinced
,
therefore
,
if
you
can
place
any
confidence
in
my
promise
,
that
I
will
employ
my
little
fortune
,
which
you
know
to
be
not
entirely
inconsiderable
,
in
the
support
of
this
your
little
family
.
<EOS>
Should
any
misfortune
,
which
I
pray
Heaven
avert
,
happen
to
you
before
you
have
better
provide
for
these
little
one
,
I
will
be
myself
their
father
,
nor
shall
either
of
them
ever
know
distress
if
it
be
any
way
in
my
power
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
Your
young
daughter
I
will
provide
for
,
and
as
for
my
little
prattler
,
your
elder
,
as
I
never
yet
think
of
any
woman
for
a
wife
,
I
will
receive
her
as
such
at
your
hand
;
nor
will
I
ever
relinquish
her
for
another
.
"
<EOS>
Heartfree
fly
to
his
friend
,
and
embrace
him
with
rapture
of
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
He
vow
to
him
that
he
have
ease
every
anxious
thought
of
his
mind
but
one
,
and
that
he
must
carry
with
him
out
of
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
o
friendly
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
"
it
be
my
concern
for
that
good
of
woman
,
whom
I
hate
myself
for

ever
censure
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
o
Friendly

<EOS>
thou
didst
know
her
goodness
;
yet

sure

her
perfect

none

She
have
every

both
of
mind
and
body
,
which
Heaven
hath
indulge
to
her
whole
sex

and
possess
all
in
a
high
excellence
than
nature
ever
indulge
to
another
in
any
single
virtue
.
<EOS>
Can
I
bear
the
loss
of
such
a
woman
?
<EOS>
Can
I
bear
the
apprehension
of
what
mischief
that
villain
may
have
do
to
her
,
of
which
death
be
perhaps
the
light
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
friendly
gently
interrupt
him
as
soon
as
he
see
any
opportunity
,
endeavour
to
comfort
him
on
this
head
likewise

by
magnify
every
circumstance
which
could
possibly
afford
any
hope
of
his
see
her

<EOS>
by
this
kind
of
behaviour
,
in
which
the
young
man
exemplify
so
uncommon
an
height
of
friendship
,
he
have
soon
obtain
in
the
castle
the
character
of
as
odd
and
silly
a
fellow
as
his
master
.
<EOS>
indeed
they
be
both
the
byword
,
laughing
-
stock
,
and
contempt
of
the
whole
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
session
now
come
on
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
the
grand
jury
at
Hicks's
-
hall
have
find
the
bill
of
indictment
against
Heartfree
,
and
on
the
second
day
of
the
session
he
be
bring
to
his
trial
;
where
,
notwithstanding
the
utmost
effort
of
Friendly
and
the
honest
old
female
servant
,
the
circumstance
of
the
fact
corroborate
the
evidence
of
Fireblood
,
as
well
as
that
of
Wild
,
who
counterfeit
the
most
artful
reluctance
at
appear
against
his
old
friend
Heartfree
,
the
jury
find
the
prisoner
guilty
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
have
now
accomplish
his
scheme
;
for
as
to
remained
,
it
be
certainly
unavoidable
,
see
Heartfree
be
entirely
void
of
interest
with
the
and
be
besides
convict
on
a
statute
the
infringer
of
which
could
hope
no
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
the
catastrophe
to
which
our
hero
have
reduce
this
wretch
be
so
wonderful
an
effort
of
greatness
,
that
it
probably
make
Fortune
envious
of
her
own
darling
;
but
whether
it
be
from
this
envy
,
or
only
from
that
know
inconstancy
and
weakness
so
often
and
judiciously
remark
in
that
lady
's
temper
,
who
frequently
lift
man
to
the
summit
of
human
greatness
,
only
    
ut
lapsu
graviore
ruant
;
  
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
she
now
begin
to
meditate
mischief
against
Wild
,
who
seem
to
have
come
to
that
period
at
which
all
hero
have
arrive
,
and
which
she
be
resolve
they
never
should
transcend
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
there
seem
to
be
a
certain
measure
of
mischief
and
iniquity
which
every
great
man
be
to
fill
up
,
and
then
Fortune
look
on
him
of
no
more
use
than
a
silkworm
whose
bottom
be
spin
,
and
desert
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blueskin
be
convict
the
same
day
of
robbery
,
by
our
hero
,
an
unkindness
which
,
though
he
have
draw
on
himself
,
and
necessitate
him
to
,
he
take
greatly
amiss
:
as
Wild
,
therefore
,
be
stand
near
him
,
with
that
disregard
and
indifference
which
great
man
be
too
carelessly
inclined
to
have
for
those
whom
they
have
ruin
,
Blueskin
,
privily
draw
a
knife
,
thrust
the
same
into
the
body
of
our
hero
with
such
violence
,
that
all
who
see
it
conclude
he
have
do
his
business
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
have
not
fortune
,
not
so
much
out
of
love
to
our
hero
as
from
a
fix
resolution
to
accomplish
a
certain
purpose
,
of
which
we
have
formerly
give
a
hint
,
carefully
place
his
gut
out
of
the
way
,
he
must
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
wrath
of
his
enemy
,
which
,
as
he
afterwards
say
,
he
do
not
deserve
;
for
,
have
he
be
content
to
have
rob
and
only
submit
to
give
him
the
booty
,
he
may
have
still
continue
safe
and
unimpeached
in
the
gang
;
but
,
so
it
be
,
that
the
knife
,
miss
noble
part
(
the
noblest
of
many
)
the
gut
,
perforate
only
the
hollow
of
his
belly
,
and
cause
no
other
harm
than
an
immoderate
effusion
of
blood
,
of
which
,
though
it
at
present
weaken
him
,
he
soon
after
recover
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
,
however
,
be
in
the
end
attend
with
bad
consequence
:
for
,
as
very
few
people
(
those
great
of
all
man
,
absolute
prince
except
)
attempt
to
cut
the
thread
of
human
life
,
like
the
fetal
sister
,
merely
out
of
wantonness
and
for
their
diversion
,
but
rather
by
so
do
propose
to
themselves
the
acquisition
of
some
future
good
,
or
the
avenging
some
past
evil
;
and
as
the
former
of
these
motive
do
not
appear
probable
,
it
put
inquisitive
person
on
examine
into
the
latter

<EOS>
now
,
as
the
vast

of

when
they

to
some

to

calculate
for
the
glory

by
several
of
those
who
think
it
principally
their
duty
to
put
a
stop
to
the
future
progress
of
our
hero
;
and
a
learned
judge
particularly
,
a
great
enemy
to
this
kind
of
greatness
,
procure
a
clause
in
an
Act
of
Parliament
a
trap
for
Wild
,
which
he
soon
after
fall
into
.
<EOS>
by
this

it
be
make
capital
in
a

a

so
plainly
calculate

ARRIVAL

in

,
with
other
occurrence
<EOS>
to
be
found
in
no
other
history
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
have
any
leisure
we
would
here
digress
a
little
on
that
ingratitude
which
so
many
writer
have
observe
to
spring
up
in
the
people
in
all
free
government
towards
their
great
man
;
who
,
while
they
have

consult
the
good
of
the
public
,
by
raise
their
own

,
in
which
the
whole

(
as
the
kingdom
of
France

itself
in
the
glory
of
their
grand
monarch
)
be
so
deeply
concerned
,
have
be
sometimes
sacrifice
by
those
very
people
for
whose
glory
the
say
great
man
be
so
industriously
at
work
:
and
this
from
a
foolish
zeal
for
a
certain
ridiculous
imaginary
thing
call
liberty
,
to
which
great
man
be
observe
to
have
a
great
animosity
.
  
<EOS>
this
law
have
be
promulgate
a
very
little
time
when
Mr.
Wild
,
have
receive
from
some
dutiful
member
of

a
valuable
piece
of
good
,
do
,
for
a
consideration
somewhat
short
of

be
ungratefully

he
be
surprize
in
his
own
house
,
and
,
be
overpower
by
number
,
be
hurry
before
a
magistrate
,
and
by
him
commit
to
that
castle
,
which
,
suitable
as
it
be
to
greatness
,
we
do
not
chuse
to
name
too
often
in
our
history
,
and
where
many
great
man
at
this
time
happen
to
be
assemble
.
  
<EOS>
the

,
or

as
the
law
more
honourably
call
him
,
keeper
of
this
castle
,
be
Mr.
Wild
's
old
friend
and
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
this
make
the
latter
greatly
satisfied
with
the
place
of
his
confinement
,
as
he
promise
himself
not
only
a
kind
reception
and
handsome
accommodation
there
,
but
even
to
obtain
his
liberty
from
him
if
he
think
it
necessary
to
desire
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
be
deceive
;
his
old
friend
know
him
no
longer
,
and
refuse
to
see
him
,
and
the
lieutenant

governor
insist
on
as
high
garnish
for
fetter
,
and
as
exorbitant
a
price
for
lodging
,
as
if
he
have
have
a
fine
gentleman
in
custody
for
murder
,
or
any
other
genteel
crime
.
  
<EOS>
to
confess
a
melancholy
truth
,
it
be
a
circumstance
much
to
be
lament
,
that
there
be
no
absolute
dependence
on
the
friendship
of
great
man
;
an
observation
which
hath
be
frequently
make
by
those
who
have
live
in
court
,
or
in
Newgate
,
or
in
any
other
place
set
apart
for
the
habitation
of
such
person

<EOS>
the
second
day
of
his
confinement
he
be
greatly
surprize
at
receive
a
visit
from
his
wife
;
and
more
so
,
when
,
instead
of
a
countenance
ready
to
insult
him
,
the
only
motive
to
which
he
could
ascribe
her
presence
,
he
see
the
tear
trickle
down
her
lovely
cheek
.
<EOS>
He
embrace
her
with
the
utmost
mark
of
affection
,
and
declare
he
could
hardly
regret
his
confinement
,
since
it
have
produce
such
an
instance
of
the
happiness
he
enjoy
in
her
,
whose
fidelity
to
him
on
this
occasion
would

be
believe

make
him
the
envy
of

He
then
beg
her
to
dry
her
eye

be
comfort

for
that
matter
may

He
could
not

not

so

he
seize

with

fling

the

He
receive
him
with

express
the
utmost
satisfaction

which
so
far
exceed
the

say
many
thing

we
remember
they
all
tend
to
the
praise
of

at

put
a
stop
to
the
torrent
of
compliment
,
by
assert
he
have
do
no
more
than
his
duty

and
that
he
should
have
detest
himself
could
he
have
forsake
his

in
his
adversity

and
,
after
many
protestation
that
he
come
the
moment
he
hear
of
his
misfortune
,
he
ask
him
if
he
could
be
of
any
service

<EOS>
Wild
answer
,
since
he
have
so
kindly
propose
that
question
,
he
must
say
he
should
be
oblige
to
him
if
he
could
lend
him
a
few
guinea
;
for
that
he
be
very
seedy

<EOS>
Fireblood
reply
that
he
be
greatly
unhappy
in
not
have
it
then
in
his
power
,
add
many
hearty
oath
that
he
have
not
a
farthing
of
money
in
his
pocket

which
be

indeed

strictly
true

he
have
only
a
bank

which
he
have
that
evening
purloin
from
a

in

He
then
ask
for
his

to

to
speak
truly

the

her
confinement

the
misfortune

be
inform

he
reprove
Wild

his
cruel
treatment

good

then

take

curiou
anecdote
relate
to
the
history
of
NEWGATE
.
 
<EOS>
there
reside
in
the
castle
at
the
same
time
with
Mr.
Wild
one
Roger
Johnson
,
a
very
great
man
,
who
have
long
be
at
the
head
of
all
the
prig
in
Newgate
,
and
have
raise
contribution
on
them
.
<EOS>
He
examine
into
the
nature
of
their
defence
,
procure
and
instruct
their
evidence
,
and
make
himself
,
at
least
in
their
opinion
,
so
necessary
to
them
,
that
the
whole
fate
of
Newgate
seem
entirely
to
depend
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
have
not
be
long
in
confinement
before
he
begin
to
oppose
this
man
.
<EOS>
He
represent
him
to
the
prig
as
a
fellow
who
,
under
the
plausible
pretence
of
assist
their
cause
,
be
in
reality
undermine
the
liberty
of
NEWGATE
.
<EOS>
He
at
first
throw
out
certain
sly
hint
and
insinuation
;
but
,
have
by
degree
form
a
party
against
Roger

he
one
day
assemble
them
together

speak
to
them
in
the

importance

that
when
I
consider
my

small
ability

I
tremble
with
an
apprehension
lest
your
safety
may

at
stake
;
your
privilege
have
be
long
undermine
,
and
be
now
openly
violate
by
one
man
;
by
one
who
hath
engross
to
himself
the
whole
conduct
of
your
trial
,
under
colour
of
which
he
exact
what
contribution
on
you
he
please
;
but
be
those
sum
appropriate
to
the
use
for
which
they
be
raise
?
<EOS>
Your
frequent
conviction
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
those
depredation
of
justice
,
must
too
sensibly
and
sorely
demonstrate
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
what
evidence
doth
he
ever
produce
for
the
prisoner
which
the
prisoner
himself
could
not
have
provide
,
and
often
better
instruct
?
<EOS>
how
many
noble
youth
have
there
be
lose
when
a
single
alibi
would
have
save
them
!
<EOS>
Should
I
be
silent
,
nay
,
could
your
own
injury
want
a
tongue
to
remonstrate
,
the
very
breath
which
by
his
neglect
hath
be
stop
at
the
cheat
would
cry
out
loudly
against
him
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
exorbitancy
of
his
plunder
visible
only
in
the
dreadful
consequence
<EOS>
it
hath
produce
to
the
prig
,
nor
glare
it
only
in
the
misery
bring
on
them
<EOS>
:
it
blaze
forth
in
the
more
desirable
effect
it
hath
work
for
himself
,
in
the
rich
perquisite
acquire
by
it
:
witness
that
silk
nightgown
,
that
robe
of
shame
,
which
,
to
his
eternal
dishonour
,
he
publicly
wear
;
that
gown
which
I
will
not
scruple
to
call
the
winding
-
sheet
of
the
liberty
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
be
there
a
prig
who
hath
the
interest
and
honour
of
Newgate
so
little
at
heart
that
he
can
refrain
from
blush
when
he
behold
that
trophy
,
purchase
with
the
breath
of
so
many
prig
?
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
.
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
embroider
with
silk
,
and
his
velvet
cap
,
buy
with
the
same
price
,
be
ensign
of
the
same
disgrace
.
<EOS>
some
would
think
the
rag
which
cover
his
nakedness
when
first
he
be
commit
hither
well
exchange
for
these
gaudy
trapping
;
but
in
my
eye
no
exchange
can
be
profitable
when
dishonour
be
the
condition
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
Newgate
"
<EOS>
here
the
only
copy
which
we
could
procure
of
this
speech
break
off
abruptly
;
however
,
we
can
assure
the
reader
,
from
very
authentic
information
,
that
he
conclude
with
advise
the
prig
to
put
their
affair
into
other
hand
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
one
of
his
party
,
as
have
be
before
concert
,
in
a
very
long
speech
recommend
him
(
Wild
himself
)
to
their
choice
.
  
<EOS>
Newgate
be
divide
into
party
on
this
occasion
,
the
prig
on
each
side
represent
their
chief
or
great
man
to
be
the
only
person
by
whom
the
affair
of
Newgate
could
be
manage
with
safety
and
advantage
.
<EOS>
the
prig
have
indeed
very
incompatible
interest
;
for
,
whereas
the
supporter
of
Johnson
,
who
be
in
possession
of
the
plunder
of
Newgate
,
be
admit
to
some
share
under
their
leader
,
so
the
abettor
of
Wild
have
,
on
his
promotion
,
the
same
view
of
divide
some
part
of
the
spoil
among
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
they
be
both
so
warm
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
what
may
seem
more
remarkable
be
,
that
the
debtor
,
who
be
entirely
unconcerned
in
the
dispute
,
and
who
be
the
destine
plunder
of
both
party
,
should
interest
themselves
with
the
utmost
violence
,
some
on
behalf
of
Wild
,
and
other
in
favour
of
Johnson
.
<EOS>
so
that
all
Newgate
resound
with
WILD
for
ever
,
JOHNSON
for
ever
.
<EOS>
and
the
poor
debtor
re
-
echo
the
liberty
of
NEWGATE
,
which
,
in
the
can
not
language
,
signifie
plunder
,
as
loudly
as
the
thief
themselves
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
such
quarrel
and
animosity
happen
between
them
,
that
they
seem
rather
the
people
of
two
country
long
at
war
with
each
other
than
the
inhabitant
of
the
same
castle
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
's
party
at
length
prevail
,
and
he
succeed
to
the
place
and
power
of
Johnson
,
whom
he
presently
strip
of
all
his
finery
;
but
,
when
it
be
propose
that
he
should
sell
it
and
divide
the
money
for
the
good
of
the
whole
,
he
wave
that
motion
,
say
it
be
not
yet
time
,
that
he
should
find
a
well
opportunity
,
that
the
cloathe
want
clean
,
with
many
other
pretence
,
and
within
two
day
,
to
the
surprize
of
many
,
he
appear
in
them
himself
;
for
which
he
vouchsafe
no
other
apology
than
that
they
fit
him
much
better
than
they
do
Johnson
,
and
that
they
become
him
in
a
much
more
elegant
manner
.
  
<EOS>
this
behaviour
of
Wild
greatly
incense
the
debtor
,
particularly
those
by
whose
mean
he
have
be
promote
.
<EOS>
They
grumble
extremely
,
and
vent
great
indignation
against
Wild
;
when
one
day
a
very
grave
man
,
and
one
of
much
authority
among
them
,
bespake
them
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
sure
can
be
more
justly
ridiculous
than
the
conduct
of
those
who
should
lay
the
lamb
in
the
wolfs
way
,
and
then
should
lament
his
be
devour
.
<EOS>
what
a
wolf
be
in
a
sheep
-
fold
,
a
great
man
be
in
society
.
<EOS>
now
,
when
one
wolf
be
in
possession
of
a
sheep
-
fold
,
how
little
would
it
avail
the
simple
flock
to
expel
him
and
place
another
in
his
stead
!
<EOS>
of
the
same
benefit
to
us
be
the
overthrow
one
prig
in
favour
of
another
.
<EOS>
and
for
what
other
advantage
be
your
struggle
?
<EOS>
do
you
not
all
know
that
Wild
and
his
follower
be
prig
,
as
well
as
Johnson
and
his
?
<EOS>
what
then
could
the
contention
be
among
such
but
that
which
you
have
now
discover
it
to
have
be
?
<EOS>
perhaps
some
would
say
,
be
it
then
our
duty
tamely
to
submit
to
the
rapine
of
the
prig
who
now
plunder
us
for
fear
of
an
exchange
?
<EOS>
surely
no
:
<EOS>
but
I
answer
,
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
shake
the
plunder
off
than
to
exchange
the
plunderer
.
<EOS>
and
by
what
mean
can
we
effect
this
but
by
a
total
change
in
our
manner
?
<EOS>
every
prig
be
a
slave
.
<EOS>
His
own
priggish
desire
,
which
enslave
him
,
themselves
betray
him
to
the
tyranny
of
other
.
<EOS>
to
preserve
,
therefore
,
the
liberty
of
Newgate
be
to
change
the
manner
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
let
us
,
therefore
,
who
be
confine
here
for
debt
only
,
separate
ourselves
entirely
from
the
prig
;
neither
drink
with
them
nor
converse
with
them
.
<EOS>
let
us
at
the
same
time
separate
ourselves
farther
from
priggism
itself
.
<EOS>
instead
of
be
ready
,
on
every
opportunity
,
to
pillage
each
other
,
let
us
be
content
with
our
honest
share
of
the
common
bounty
,
and
with
the
acquisition
of
our
own
industry
.
<EOS>
when
we
separate
from
the
prig
,
let
us
enter
into
a
close
alliance
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
let
us
consider
ourselves
all
as
member
of
one
community
,
to
the
public
good
of
which
we
be
to
sacrifice
our
private
view
;
not
to
give
up
the
interest
of
the
whole
for
every
little
pleasure
or
profit
which
shall
accrue
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
liberty
be
consistent
with
no
degree
of
honesty
inferior
to
this
,
and
the
community
where
this
abound
no
prig
will
have
the
impudence
or
audaciousness
to
endeavour
to
enslave
;
or
if
he
should
,
his
own
destruction
would
be
the
only
consequence
of
his
attempt
.
<EOS>
but
while
one
man
pursue
his
ambition
,
another
his
interest
,
another
his
safety
;
while
one
hath
a
roguery
(
a
priggism
they
here
call
it
)
to
commit
,
and
another
a
roguery
to
defend
;
they
must
naturally
fly
to
the
favour
and
protection
of
those
who
have
power
to
give
them
what
they
desire
,
and
to
defend
them
from
what
they
fear
;
nay
,
in
this
view
it
become
their
interest
to
promote
this
power
in
their
patron
.
<EOS>
now
,
gentleman
,
when
we
be
no
longer
prig
,
we
shall
no
longer
have
these
fear
or
these
desire
.
<EOS>
what
remain
,
therefore
,
for
us
but
to
resolve
bravely
to
lay
aside
our
priggism
,
our
roguery
,
in
plainer
word
,
and
preserve
our
liberty
,
or
to
give
up
the
latter
in
the
preservation
and
preference
of
the
former
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
speech
be
receive
with
much
applause
;
however
,
Wild
continue
as
before
to
levy
contribution
among
the
prisoner
,
to
apply
the
garnish
to
his
own
use
,
and
to
strut
openly
in
the
ornament
which
he
have
strip
from
Johnson
.
<EOS>
to
speak
sincerely
,
there
be
more
bravado
than
real
use
or
advantage
in
these
trapping
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
nightgown
,
its
outside
indeed
make
a
glitter
tinsel
appearance
,
but
it
keep
him
not
warm
,
nor
could
the
finery
of
it
do
him
much
honour
,
since
every
one
know
it
do
not
properly
belong
to
him
;
as
to
the
waistcoat
,
it
fit
him
very
ill
,
be
infinitely
too
big
for
him
;
and
the
cap
be
so
heavy
that
it
make
his
head
ache
.
<EOS>
thus
these
cloathe
,
which
perhaps
(
as
they
present
the
idea
of
their
misery
more
sensibly
to
the
people
's
eye
)
bring
him
more
envy
,
hatred
,
and
detraction
,
than
all
his
deep
imposition
and
more
real
advantage
,
afford
very
little
use
or
honour
to
the
wearer
;
nay
,
could
scarce
serve
to
amuse
his
own
vanity
when
this
be
cool
enough
to
reflect
with
the
least
seriousness
.
<EOS>
and
,
should
I
speak
in
the
language
of
a
man
who
estimate
human
happiness
without
regard
to
that
greatness
,
which
we
have
so
laboriously
endeavour
to
paint
in
this
history
<EOS>
,
it
be
probable
<EOS>
he
never
take
<EOS>
(
i.e.
rob
the
prisoner
of
)
a
shilling
,
which
he
himself
do
not
pay
too
dear
for
.
   
<EOS>
the
dead
-
warrant
ARRIVES
for
heartfree
;
ON
which
occasion
WILD
betray
some
HUMAN
WEAKNESS
.
 
<EOS>
the
dead
-
warrant
,
as
it
be
call
,
now
come
down
to
Newgate
for
the
execution
of
Heartfree
among
the
rest
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
and
here
the
reader
must
excuse
us
,
who
profes
to
draw
natural
,
not
perfect
character
,
and
to
record
the
truth
of
history
,
not
the
extravagance
of
romance
,
while
we
relate
a
weakness
in
Wild
of
which
we
be
ourselves
ashamed
,
and
which
we
would
willingly
have
conceal
,
could
we
have
preserve
at
the
same
time
that
strict
attachment
to
truth
and
impartiality
,
which
we
have
profess
in
record
the
annal
of
this
great
man
.
<EOS>
know
then
,
reader
,
that
this
dead
-
warrant
do
not
affect
Heartfree
,
who
be
to
suffer
a
shameful
death
by
it
,
with
half
the
concern
it
give
Wild
,
who
have
be
the
occasion
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
little
strike
the
day
before
on
see
the
child
carry
away
in
tear
from
their
father
.
<EOS>
this
sight
bring
the
remembrance
of
some
slight
injury
he
have
do
the
father
to
his
mind
,
which
he
endeavour
as
much
as
possible
to
obliterate
;
but
,
when
one
of
the
keeper
(
I
should
say
lieutenant
of
the
castle
)
repeat
Heartfree
's
name
among
those
of
the
malefactor
who
be
to
suffer
within
a
few
day
,
the
blood
forsake
his
countenance
,
and
in
a
cold
still
stream
move
heavily
to
his
heart
,
which
have
scarce
strength
enough
leave
to
return
it
through
his
vein
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
body
so
visibly
demonstrate
the
pang
of
his
mind
,
that
to
escape
observation
he
retire
to
his
room
,
where
he
sullenly
give
vent
to
such
bitter
agony
,
that
even
the
injure
Heartfree
,
have
not
the
apprehension
of
what
his
wife
have
suffer
shut
every
avenue
of
compassion
,
would
have
pity
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
his
mind
be
thoroughly
fatigue
,
and
wear
out
with
the
horror
which
the
approach
fate
of
the
poor
wretch
,
who
lie
under
a
sentence
which
he
have
iniquitously
bring
upon
him
,
have
suggest
,
sleep
promise
him
relief
;
but
this
promise
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
delusive
.
<EOS>
this
certain
friend
to
the
tired
body
be
often
the
severe
enemy
to
the
oppress
mind
.
<EOS>
so
at
least
it
prove
to
Wild
,
add
visionary
to
real
horror
,
and
torment
his
imagination
with
phantom
too
dreadful
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
start
from
these
vision
,
he
no
sooner
recover
his
wake
sense
,
than
he
cry
out
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
yet
prevent
this
catastrophe
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
too
late
to
discover
the
whole
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
pause
a
moment
;
but
greatness
,
instantly
return
to
his
assistance
,
check
the
base
thought
,
as
it
first
offer
itself
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
then
reason
thus
coolly
with
himself
:
 
"
Shall
I
,
like
a
child
,
or
a
woman
,
or
one
of
those
mean
wretch
whom
I
have
always
despise
,
be
frighten
by
dream
and
visionary
phantom
to
sully
that
honour
which
I
have
so
difficultly
acquire
and
so
gloriously
maintain
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
,
to
redeem
the
worthless
life
of
this
silly
fellow
,
suffer
my
reputation
to
contract
a
stain
which
the
blood
of
million
can
not
wipe
away
?
<EOS>
be
it
only
that
the
few
,
the
simple
part
of
mankind
,
should
call
me
a
rogue
,
perhaps
I
could
submit
;
but
to
be
for
ever
contemptible
to
the
prig
,
as
a
wretch
who
want
spirit
to
execute
my
undertaking
,
can
never
be
digest
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
life
of
a
single
man
?
<EOS>
have
not
whole
army
and
nation
be
sacrifice
to
the
honour
of
one
great
man
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
to
omit
that
first
class
of
greatness
,
the
conqueror
of
mankind
,
how
often
have
number
fall
by
a
fictitious
plot
only
to
satisfy
the
spleen
,
or
perhaps
exercise
the
ingenuity
,
of
a
member
of
that
second
order
of
greatness
the
ministerial
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
then
?
<EOS>
why
,
I
have
ruin
a
family
,
and
bring
an
innocent
man
to
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
I
ought
rather
to
weep
with
Alexander
that
I
have
ruin
no
more
,
than
to
regret
the
little
I
have
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
at
length
,
therefore
,
bravely
resolve
to
consign
over
Heartfree
to
his
fate
,
though
it
cost
him
more
struggle
than
may
easily
be
believe
,
utterly
to
conquer
his
reluctance
,
and
to
banish
away
every
degree
of
humanity
from
his
mind
,
these
little
spark
of
which
compose
one
of
those
weakness
which
we
lament
in
the
opening
of
our
history
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
vindication
of
our
hero
,
we
must
beg
leave
to
observe
that
Nature
be
seldom
so
kind
as
those
writer
who
draw
character
absolutely
perfect
.
<EOS>
She
seldom
create
any
man
so
completely
great
,
or
completely
low
,
but
that
some
spark
of
humanity
will
glimmer
in
the
former
,
and
some
spark
of
what
the
vulgar
call
evil
will
dart
forth
in
the
latter
:
utterly
to
extinguish
which
will
give
some
pain
,
and
uneasiness
to
both
;
for
I
apprehend
no
mind
be
ever
yet
form
entirely
free
from
blemish
,
unless
peradventure
that
of
a
sanctify
hypocrite
,
whose
praise
some
well
-
feed
flatterer
hath
gratefully
think
proper
to
sing
forth
.
   
<EOS>
contain
VARIOUS
matter
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
now
come
when
poor
Heartfree
be
to
suffer
an
ignominious
death
.
<EOS>
Friendly
have
in
the
strong
manner
confirm
his
assurance
of
fulfil
his
promise
of
become
a
father
to
one
of
his
child
and
a
husband
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
this
give
him
inexpressible
comfort
,
and
he
have
,
the
evening
before
,
take
his
last
leave
of
the
little
wretch
with
a
tenderness
which
draw
a
tear
from
one
of
the
keepers
,
join
to
a
magnanimity
which
would
have
please
a
stoic
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
inform
that
the
coach
which
Friendly
have
provide
for
him
be
ready
,
and
that
the
rest
of
the
prisoner
be
go
,
he
embrace
that
faithful
friend
with
great
passion
,
and
beg
that
he
would
leave
him
here
;
but
the
other
desire
leave
to
accompany
him
to
his
end
,
which
at
last
he
be
force
to
comply
with
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
be
proceed
towards
the
coach
when
he
find
his
difficulty
be
not
yet
over
;
for
now
a
friend
arrive
of
whom
he
be
to
take
a
hard
and
more
tender
leave
than
he
have
yet
go
through
.
<EOS>
this
friend
,
reader
,
be
no
other
than
Mrs.
Heartfree
herself
,
who
run
to
him
with
a
look
all
wild
,
stare
,
and
frantic
,
and
have
reach
his
arm
,
faint
away
in
them
without
utter
a
single
syllable
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
be
,
with
great
difficulty
,
able
to
preserve
his
own
sense
in
such
a
surprize
at
such
a
season
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
our
good
-
natured
reader
will
be
rather
inclined
to
wish
this
miserable
couple
have
,
by
die
in
each
other
's
arm
,
put
a
final
period
to
their
woe
,
than
have
survive
to
taste
those
bitter
moment
which
be
to
be
their
portion
,
and
which
the
unhappy
wife
,
soon
recover
from
the
short
intermission
of
be
,
now
begin
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
when
she
become
first
mistress
of
her
voice
she
burst
forth
into
the
follow
accent
:
  
"
o
my
husband
!
<EOS>
be
this
the
condition
in
which
I
find
you
after
our
cruel
separation
?
<EOS>
who
hath
do
this
?
<EOS>
Cruel
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
occasion
?
<EOS>
I
know
thou
canst
deserve
no
ill
.
<EOS>
tell
me
,
somebody
who
can
speak
,
while
I
have
my
sense
leave
to
understand
,
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
several
laugh
,
and
one
answer
,
"
the
matter
!
<EOS>
why
no
great
matter
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
not
the
first
,
nor
will
not
be
the
last
:
the
bad
of
the
matter
be
,
that
if
we
be
to
stay
all
the
morning
here
I
shall
lose
my
dinner
.
"
<EOS>
Heartfree
,
pause
a
moment
and
recollect
himself
,
cry
out
,
"
I
will
bear
all
with
patience
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
address
himself
to
the
command
officer
,
beg
he
may
only
have
a
few
minute
by
himself
with
his
wife
,
whom
he
have
not
see
before
since
his
misfortune
.
<EOS>
the
great
man
answer
,
"
He
have
compassion
on
him
,
and
would
do
more
than
he
could
answer
;
but
he
suppose
he
be
too
much
<EOS>
a
gentleman
not
to
know
that
something
be
due
for
such
civility
.
<EOS>
"
on
this
hint
,
Friendly
,
who
be
himself
half
dead
,
pull
five
guinea
out
of
his
pocket
,
which
the
great
man
take
,
and
say
he
would
be
so
generous
to
give
him
ten
minute
;
on
which
one
observe
that
many
a
gentleman
have
buy
ten
minute
with
a
woman
dearer
,
and
many
other
facetious
remark
be
make
,
unnecessary
to
be
here
relate
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
be
now
suffer
to
retire
into
a
room
with
his
wife
,
the
commander
inform
him
at
his
entrance
that
he
must
be
expeditious
,
for
that
the
rest
of
the
good
company
would
be
at
the
tree
before
him
,
and
he
suppose
he
be
a
gentleman
of
too
much
breeding
to
make
them
wait
.
  
<EOS>
this
tender
wretched
couple
be
now
retire
for
these
few
minute
,
which
the
commander
without
carefully
measure
with
his
watch
;
and
Heartfree
be
muster
all
his
resolution
to
part
with
what
his
soul
so
ardently
doate
on
,
and
to
conjure
her
to
support
his
loss
for
the
sake
of
her
poor
infant
,
and
to
comfort
her
with
the
promise
of
Friendly
on
their
account
;
but
all
his
design
be
frustrate
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
could
not
support
the
shock
,
but
again
faint
away
,
and
so
entirely
lose
every
symptom
of
life
that
Heartfree
call
vehemently
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
Friendly
rush
first
into
the
room
,
and
be
soon
follow
by
many
other
,
and
,
what
be
remarkable
,
one
who
have
unmove
beheld
the
tender
scene
between
these
parting
lover
be
touch
to
the
quick
by
the
pale
look
of
the
woman
,
and
run
up
and
down
for
water
,
drops
,
&
c.
,
with
the
utmost
hurry
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
the
ten
minute
be
expire
,
which
the
commander
now
hint
;
and
see
nothing
offer
for
the
renewal
of
the
term
(
for
indeed
Friendly
have
unhappily
empty
his
pocket
)
,
he
begin
to
grow
very
importunate
,
and
at
last
tell
Heartfree
he
should
be
ashamed
not
to
act
more
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
Heartfree
beg
his
pardon
,
and
say
he
would
make
him
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
then
,
with
the
deep
sigh
,
cry
,
"
oh
,
my
angel
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
embrace
his
wife
with
the
utmost
eagerness
,
kiss
her
pale
lip
with
more
fervency
than
ever
<EOS>
bridegroom
do
the
blush
cheek
of
his
bride
.
<EOS>
He
then
cry
,
"
the
Almighty
bless
thee
!
<EOS>
and
,
if
it
be
his
pleasure
,
restore
thee
to
life
;
if
not
,
I
beseech
him
<EOS>
we
may
presently
meet
again
in
a
well
world
than
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
break
from
her
,
when
,
perceive
her
sense
return
,
he
could
not
forbear
renew
his
embrace
,
and
again
press
her
lip
,
which
now
recover
life
and
warmth
so
fast
that
he
beg
one
ten
minute
more
to
tell
her
what
her
swooning
have
prevent
her
hearing
.
<EOS>
the
worthy
commander
,
be
perhaps
a
little
touched
at
this
tender
scene
,
take
friendly
aside
,
and
ask
him
what
he
would
give
if
he
would
suffer
his
friend
to
remain
half
-
an
-
hour
?
<EOS>
Friendly
answer
,
anything
;
that
he
have
no
more
money
in
his
pocket
,
but
he
would
certainly
pay
him
that
afternoon
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
I
will
be
moderate
,
"
say
he
;
"
twenty
guinea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Friendly
answer
,
"
It
be
a
bargain
.
"
<EOS>
the
commander
,
have
exact
a
firm
promise
,
cry
,
"
then
I
do
not
care
if
they
stay
a
whole
hour
together
;
for
what
signifie
hide
good
news
?
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
reprieve
;
"
of
which
he
have
just
before
receive
notice
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
impertinent
to
offer
at
a
description
of
the
joy
this
occasion
to
the
two
friend
,
or
to
Mrs.
Heartfree
,
who
be
now
again
recover
.
<EOS>
a
surgeon
,
who
be
happily
present
,
be
employ
to
bleed
them
all
.
<EOS>
after
which
the
commander
,
who
have
his
promise
of
the
money
again
confirm
to
him
,
wish
Heartfree
joy
,
and
,
shake
him
very
friendly
by
the
hand
,
clear
the
room
of
all
the
company
,
and
leave
the
three
friend
together
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
the
FOREGOING
happy
INCIDENT
be
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
,
though
I
be
convince
my
good
-
natured
reader
may
almost
want
the
surgeon
's
assistance
also
,
and
that
there
be
no
passage
in
this
whole
story
which
can
afford
him
equal
delight
,
yet
,
lest
our
reprieve
should
seem
to
resemble
that
in
the
Beggars
'
Opera
,
I
shall
endeavour
to
shew
him
that
this
incident
,
which
be
undoubtedly
true
,
be
at
least
as
natural
as
delightful
;
for
we
assure
him
we
would
rather
have
suffer
half
mankind
to
be
hang
,
than
have
save
one
contrary
to
the
strict
rule
of
writing
and
probability
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
know
,
then
(
a
circumstance
which
I
think
highly
credible
)
,
that
the
great
Fireblood
have
be
,
a
few
day
before
,
take
in
the
fact
of
a
robbery
,
and
carry
before
the
same
justice
of
peace
who
have
,
on
his
evidence
,
commit
Heartfree
to
prison
.
<EOS>
this
magistrate
,
who
do
indeed
no
small
honour
to
the
commission
he
bear
,
duly
consider
the
weighty
charge
committed
to
him
,
by
which
he
be
entrust
with
decision
affect
the
life
,
liberty
,
and
property
of
his
countryman
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
examine
always
with
the
utmost
diligence
and
caution
into
every
minute
circumstance
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
have
a
good
deal
balance
,
even
when
he
commit
Heartfree
,
on
the
excellent
character
give
him
by
Friendly
and
the
maid
;
and
as
he
be
much
stagger
on
find
that
,
of
the
two
person
on
whose
evidence
alone
Heartfree
have
be
commit
,
and
have
be
since
convict
,
one
be
in
Newgate
for
a
felony
,
and
the
other
be
now
bring
before
him
for
a
robbery
<EOS>
,
he
think
proper
to
put
the
matter
very
home
to
fireblood
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
the
young
Achates
be
take
,
as
we
have
say
,
in
the
fact
;
so
that
denial
he
see
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
honestly
confess
what
he
know
must
be
prove
;
and
desire
,
on
the
merit
of
the
discovery
he
make
,
to
be
admit
as
an
evidence
against
his
accomplice
.
<EOS>
this
afford
the
happy
opportunity
to
the
justice
to
satisfy
his
conscience
in
relation
to
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Fireblood
that
,
if
he
expect
the
favour
he
solicit
,
it
must
be
on
condition
that
he
reveal
the
whole
truth
to
him
concern
the
evidence
which
he
have
lately
give
against
a
bankrupt
,
and
which
some
circumstance
have
induce
a
suspicion
of
;
that
he
may
depend
on
it
<EOS>
the
truth
would
be
discover
by
other
mean
,
and
give
some
oblique
hint
(
a
deceit
entirely
justifiable
)
that
Wild
himself
have
offer
such
a
discovery
.
<EOS>
the
very
mention
of
Wild
's
name
immediately
alarm
Fireblood
,
who
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
the
readiness
of
that
GREAT
MAN
to
hang
any
of
the
gang
when
his
own
interest
seem
to
require
it
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
hesitate
not
a
moment
;
but
,
have
obtain
a
promise
from
the
justice
that
he
should
be
accept
as
an
evidence
,
he
discover
the
whole
falsehood
,
and
declare
that
he
have
be
seduce
by
Wild
to
depose
as
he
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
,
have
thus
luckily
and
timely
discover
this
scene
of
villany
,
alias
greatness
,
lose
not
a
moment
in
use
his
utmost
endeavour
to
get
the
case
of
the
unhappy
convict
represent
to
the
sovereign
,
who
immediately
grant
him
that
gracious
reprieve
which
cause
such
happiness
to
the
person
concern
;
and
which
we
hope
we
have
now
account
for
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
magistrate
,
have
obtain
this
reprieve
for
Heartfree
,
think
it
incumbent
on
him
to
visit
him
in
the
prison
,
and
to
sound
,
if
possible
,
the
depth
of
this
affair
,
that
,
if
he
should
appear
as
innocent
as
he
now
begin
to
conceive
him
,
he
may
use
all
imaginable
method
to
obtain
his
pardon
and
enlargement
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
therefore
after
that
when
the
miserable
scene
above
describe
have
pass
,
he
go
to
Newgate
,
where
he
find
those
three
person
,
namely
,
Heartfree
,
his
wife
,
and
friendly
,
sit
together
.
<EOS>
the
justice
inform
the
prisoner
of
the
confession
of
Fireblood
,
with
the
step
which
he
have
take
upon
it
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
easily
conceive
the
many
outward
thank
,
as
well
as
inward
gratitude
,
which
he
receive
from
all
three
;
but
those
be
of
very
little
consequence
to
him
compare
with
the
secret
satisfaction
he
feel
in
his
mind
from
reflect
on
the
preservation
of
innocence
,
as
he
soon
after
very
clearly
perceive
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
room
Mrs.
Heartfree
be
speak
with
some
earnestness
:
as
he
perceive
,
therefore
,
he
have
interrupt
her
,
he
beg
she
would
continue
her
discourse
,
which
,
if
he
prevent
by
his
presence
,
he
desire
to
depart
;
but
Heartfree
would
not
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
have
be
relate
some
adventure
which
perhaps
,
may
entertain
him
to
hear
,
and
which
she
the
rather
desire
he
would
hear
,
as
they
may
serve
to
illustrate
the
foundation
on
which
this
falsehood
have
be
build
,
which
have
bring
on
her
husband
all
his
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
very
gladly
consent
,
and
Mrs.
Heartfree
,
at
her
husband
's
desire
,
begin
the
relation
from
the
first
renewal
of
Wild
's
acquaintance
with
him
;
but
,
though
this
recapitulation
be
necessary
for
the
information
of
our
good
magistrate
,
as
it
would
be
useless
,
and
perhaps
tedious
,
to
the
reader
,
we
shall
only
repeat
that
part
of
her
story
to
which
he
be
only
a
stranger
,
begin
with
what
happen
to
her
after
Wild
have
be
turn
adrift
in
the
boat
by
the
captain
of
the
french
privateer
.
   
<EOS>
MRS
.
HEARTFREE
relate
her
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
proceed
thus
:
"
the
vengeance
which
the
french
captain
exact
on
that
villain
(
our
hero
)
persuade
me
that
I
be
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
man
of
honour
and
justice
;
nor
indeed
be
it
possible
for
any
person
to
be
treat
with
more
respect
and
civility
than
I
now
be
;
but
if
this
could
not
mitigate
my
sorrow
when
I
reflect
on
the
condition
in
which
I
have
be
betray
to
leave
all
that
be
dear
to
me
,
much
less
<EOS>
could
it
produce
such
an
effect
when
I
discover
,
as
I
soon
do
,
that
I
owe
it
chiefly
to
a
passion
which
threaten
me
with
great
uneasiness
,
as
it
quickly
appear
to
be
very
violent
,
and
as
I
be
absolutely
in
the
power
of
the
person
who
possess
it
,
or
be
rather
possess
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
however
do
him
the
justice
to
say
my
fear
carry
my
suspicion
farther
than
I
afterwards
find
I
have
any
reason
to
carry
them
:
he
do
indeed
very
soon
acquaint
me
with
his
passion
,
and
use
all
those
gentle
method
which
frequently
succeed
with
our
sex
to
prevail
with
me
to
gratify
it
;
but
never
once
threaten
,
nor
have
the
least
recourse
to
force
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
once
insinuate
to
me
that
I
be
totally
in
his
power
,
which
I
myself
sufficiently
see
,
and
whence
<EOS>
I
draw
the
most
dreadful
apprehension
,
well
know
that
,
as
there
be
some
disposition
so
brutal
<EOS>
that
cruelty
add
a
zest
and
savour
to
their
pleasure
,
so
there
be
other
whose
gentler
inclination
be
better
gratified
when
they
win
us
by
soft
method
to
comply
with
their
desire
;
yet
that
even
these
may
be
often
compel
by
an
unruly
passion
to
have
recourse
at
last
to
the
mean
of
violence
,
when
they
despair
of
success
from
persuasion
;
but
I
be
happily
the
captive
of
a
well
man
.
<EOS>
My
conqueror
be
one
of
those
over
whom
vice
hath
a
limited
jurisdiction
;
and
,
though
he
be
too
easily
prevail
on
to
sin
,
he
be
proof
against
any
temptation
to
villany
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
two
day
almost
totally
becalmed
,
<EOS>
when
,
a
brisk
gale
rise
as
we
be
in
sight
in
Dunkirk
,
we
see
a
vessel
make
full
sail
towards
us
.
<EOS>
the
captain
of
the
privateer
be
so
strong
that
he
apprehend
no
danger
but
from
a
man
-
of
-
war
,
which
the
sailor
discern
this
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
strike
his
colour
,
and
furl
his
sail
as
much
as
possible
,
in
order
to
lie
by
and
expect
her
,
hope
she
may
be
a
prize
.

<EOS>
(
here
Heartfree

his
wife
stop
and
inquire
the
cause

<EOS>
He
tell
her
it
be
from
her
use

sea

term
so
aptly
:
she
laugh
,
and
answer
he
would
wonder
less
at
this
when
he
hear
the
long
time
she
have
be
on
board
;
and
then
proceed
.
)
<EOS>
"
this
vessel
now
come
alongside
of
us
,
and
hail
us
,
have
perceive
that
on
which
we
be
aboard
to
be
of
her
own
country
;
they
beg
us
not
to
put
into
Dunkirk
,
but
to
accompany
them
in
their
pursuit
of
a
large
English
merchantman
,
whom
we
should
easily
overtake
,
and
both
together
as
easily
conquer
.
<EOS>
Our
captain
immediately
consent
to
this
proposition
,
and
order
all
his
sail
to
be
crowd
.
<EOS>
this
be
most
unwelcome
news
to
me
;
however
,
he
comfort
me
all
he
could
by
assure
me
I
have
nothing
to
fear
,
that
he
would
be
so
far
from
offer
the
least
rudeness
to
me
himself
,
that
he
would
,
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
,
protect
me
from
it
.
<EOS>
this
assurance
give
me
all
the
consolation
which
my
present
circumstance
and
the
dreadful
apprehension
I
have
on
your
dear
account
would
admit
.

at
which
word
the
tender
glance
pass
on
both
side
between
the
husband
and

)
  
<EOS>
"
We
sail
near
twelve
hour
,
when
we
come
in
sight
of
the
ship
we
be
in
pursuit
of
,
and
which
we
should
probably
have
soon
come
up
with
have
not
a
very
thick
mist
ravish
her
from
our
eye

<EOS>
this
mist
continue
several
hour
,
and
when
it
clear
up
we
discover
our
companion
at
a
great
distance
from
us
;
but
what
give
us
(
I
mean
the
captain
and
his
crew
)
<EOS>
the
great
uneasiness
be
the
sight
of
a
very
large
ship
within
a
mile
of
us
,
which
presently
salute
us
with
a
gun
,
and
now
appear
to
be
a
third
-
rate
english
man
-
of
-
war

<EOS>
Our
captain
declare
the
impossibility
of
either
fighting
or
escaping
,
and
accordingly
strike
without
wait
for
the
broadside
which
be
prepare
for
us
,
and
which
perhaps
would
have
prevent
me
from
the
happiness
I
now
enjoy
.
"
<EOS>
this
occasion
Heartfree
to
change
colour
;
his
wife
therefore
pass
hastily
to
circumstance
of
a
more
smile
complexion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
greatly
rejoice
at
this
event
,
as
I
think
it
would
not
only
restore
me
to
the
safe
possession
of
my
jewel
,
but
to
what
I
value
beyond
all
the
treasure
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
My
expectation
,
however
,
of
both
these
be
somewhat
crost
for
the
present
:
as
to
the
former
,
I
be
tell
they
should
be
carefully
preserve
;
but
that
I
must
prove
my
right
to
them
before
I
could
expect
their
restoration
,
which
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
the
captain
do
not
very
eagerly
desire
I
should
be
able
to
accomplish
:
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
latter
,
I
be
acquaint
that
I
should
be
put
on
board
the
first
ship
which
they
meet
on
her
way
to
England
,
but
that
they
be
proceed
to
the
West
Indies
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
be
long
on
board
the
man
-
of
-
war
before
I
discover
just
reason
rather
to
lament
than
rejoice
at
the
exchange
of
my
captivity
;
for
such
I
conclude
my
present
situation
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
another
lover
in
the
captain
of
this
Englishman
,
and
much
rough
and
less
gallant
than
the
Frenchman
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
use
me
with
scarce
common
civility
,
as
indeed
he
shew
very
little
to
any
other
person
,
treat
his
officer
little
better
than
a
man
of
no
great
good
-
breeding
would
exert
to
his
mean
servant
,
and
that
too
on
some
very
irritating
provocation
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
he
address
me
with
the
insolence
of
a
basha
to
a
circassian
slave
;
he
talk
to
me
with
the
loose
licence
in
which
the
most
profligate
libertine
converse
with
harlot
,
and
which
woman
abandon
only
in
a
moderate
degree
detest
and
abhor
.
<EOS>
He
often
kiss
me
with
very
rude
familiarity
,
and
one
day
attempt
further
brutality
;
when
a
gentleman
on
board
,
and
who
be
in
my
situation
,
that
is
,
have
be
take
by
a
privateer
and
be
retake
,
rescue
me
from
his
hand
,
for
which
the
captain
confine
him
,
though
he
be
not
under
his
command
,
two
day
in
iron
:
when
he
be
release
(
for
I
be
not
suffer
to
visit
him
in
his
confinement
)
<EOS>
I
go
to
him
and
thank
him
with
the
utmost
acknowledgment
for
what
he
have
do
and
suffer
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
behave
to
me
in
the
handsome
manner
on
this
occasion
;
tell
me
he
be
ashamed
of
the
high
sense
<EOS>
I
seem
to
entertain
of
so
small
an
obligation
of
an
action
to
which
his
duty
as
a
Christian
and
his
honour
as
a
man
oblige
him
.
<EOS>
from
this
time
I
live
in
great
familiarity
with
this
man
,
whom
I
regard
as
my
protector
,
which
he
profess
himself
ready
to
be
on
all
occasion
,
express
the
utmost
abhorrence
of
the
captain
's
brutality
,
especially
that
shew
towards
me
,
and
the
tenderness
of
a
parent
for
the
preservation
of
my
virtue
,
for
which
I
be
not
myself
more
solicitous
than
he
appear
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
the
only
man
I
have
hitherto
meet
since
my
unhappy
departure
who
do
not
endeavour
by
all
his
look
,
word
,
and
action
,
to
assure
me
he
have
a
liking
to
my
unfortunate
person
;
the
rest
seem
desirous
of
sacrifice
the
little
beauty
they
compliment
to
their
desire
,
without
the
least
consideration
of
the
ruin
which
I
earnestly
represent
to
them
they
be
attempt
to
bring
on
me
and
on
my
future
repose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
pass
several
day
pretty
free
from
the
captain
's
molestation
,
till
one
fatal
night
.
<EOS>
"
here
,
perceive
Heartfree
grow
pale
,
she
comfort
him
by
an
assurance
that
Heaven
have
preserve
her
chastity
,
and
again
have
restore
her
unsullied
to
his
arm
.
<EOS>
She
continue
thus
:
"
perhaps
I
give
it
a
wrong
epithet
in
the
word
fatal
;
but
a
wretched
night
I
be
sure
I
may
call
it
,
for
no
woman
who
come
off
victorious
<EOS>
be
,
I
believe
,
ever
in
great
danger
.
<EOS>
one
night
I
say
,
have
drink
his
spirit
high
with
punch
,
in
company
with
the
purser
,
who
be
the
only
man
in
the
ship
he
admit
to
his
table
,
the
captain
send
for
me
into
his
cabin
;
whither
,
though
unwilling
,
I
be
oblige
to
go
.
<EOS>
We
be
no
sooner
alone
together
than
he
seize
me
by
the
hand
,
and
,
after
affront
my
ear
with
discourse
which
I
be
unable
to
repeat
,
he
swear
a
great
oath
that
his
passion
be
to
be
dally
with
no
longer
;
that
I
must
not
expect
to
treat
him
in
the
manner
to
which
a
set
of
blockhead
land
-
man
submit
.
<EOS>
"
none
of
your
coquette
air
,
therefore
,
with
me
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
I
be
resolve
to
have
you
this
night
.
<EOS>
no
struggle
nor
squall
,
for
both
will
be
impertinent
.
<EOS>
the
first
man
who
offer
to
come
in
here
,
I
will
have
his
skin
flea'd
off
at
the
gangway
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
attempt
to
pull
me
violently
towards
his
bed
.
<EOS>
I
throw
myself
on
my
knee
,
and
with
tear
and
entreaty
besought
his
compassion
;
but
this
be
,
I
find
,
to
no
purpose
:
<EOS>
I
then
have
recourse
to
threat
,
and
endeavour
to
frighten
him
with
the
consequence
;
but
neither
have
this
,
though
it
seem
to
stagger
him
more
than
the
other
method
,
sufficient
force
to
deliver
me
.
<EOS>
at
last
a
stratagem
come
into
my
head
,
of
which
my
perceive
him
reel
give
me
the
first
hint
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
a
moment
's
reprieve
only
,
when
,
collect
all
the
spirit
I
could
muster
,
I
put
on
a
constrained
air
of
gayety
,
and
tell
him
,
with
an
affected
laugh
,
he
be
the
roughest
lover
I
have
ever
meet
with
,
and
that
I
believe
I
be
the
first
woman
he
have
ever
pay
his
address
to
.
<EOS>
address
,
say
he
;
d####n
your
dress
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
undress
you
.
<EOS>
I
then
beg
him
to
let
us
drink
some
punch
together
;
for
that
I
love
a
can
as
well
as
himself
,
and
never
would
grant
the
favour
to
any
man
till
I
have
drink
a
hearty
glass
with
him
.
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
if
that
be
all
you
shall
have
punch
enough
to
drown
yourself
in
.
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
ring
the
bell
,
and
order
in
a
gallon
of
that
liquor
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
meantime
<EOS>
oblige
to
suffer
his
nauseous
kiss
,
and
some
rudeness
which
I
have
great
difficulty
to
restrain
within
moderate
bound
.
<EOS>
when
the
punch
come
in
he
take
up
the
bowl
and
drank
my
health
ostentatiously
,
in
such
a
quantity
that
it
considerably
advance
my
scheme
.
<EOS>
I
follow
him
with
bumper
as
fast
as
possible
,
and
be
myself
oblige
to
drink
so
much
that
at
another
time
it
would
have
stagger
my
own
reason
,
but
at
present
it
do
not
affect
me
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
perceive
him
very
far
go
,
I
watch
an
opportunity
,
and
run
out
of
the
cabin
,
resolve
to
seek
protection
of
the
sea
if
I
could
find
no
other
;
but
Heaven
be
now
graciously
pleased
to
relieve
me
;
for
in
his
attempt
to
pursue
me
he
reel
backwards
,
and
,
fall
down
the
cabbin
stair
,
he
dislocate
his
shoulder
and
so
bruise
himself
that
I
be
not
only
preserve
that
night
from
any
danger
of
my
intend
ravisher
,
but
the
accident
throw
him
into
a
fever
which
endanger
his
life
,
and
whether
he
ever
recover
or
no
<EOS>
I
be
not
certain
;
for
during
his
delirious
fit
the
eld
lieutenant

ship

twenty

five
year
in
that
post
without
be
able
to
obtain
a
ship

and
have
see
several
boy

the
bastard
of
nobleman

put
over
his
head

one
day
while

Cork
pass
by

myself

two
day

go
on
board
this
ship
with
the
leave
of
the
good
lieutenant

who
make
us
such
present
as
he
be
able
of
provision

congratulate
me
on
my
delivery
from

danger
to

<EOS>
the
first
evening
after
we
be
aboard
this
vessel
,
which
be
a
brigantine
,
we
be
then
at
no
very
great
distance
from
the
Madeiras

the
most
violent
storm
arise
from
the
northwest
,
in
which
we
presently
lose
both
our
mast
;
and
indeed
death
now
present
itself
as
inevitable
to
us
:
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
my
Tommy
what
be
then
my
thought
.
<EOS>
Our
danger
be
so
great
that
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
a
professed
atheist
,
betook
himself
to
prayer
,
and
the
whole
crew
,
abandon
themselves
for
lose
,
fall
with
the
utmost
eagerness
to
the
empty
a
cask
of
brandy
,
not
one
drop
of
which
they
swear
should
be
pollute
with
salt
water

<EOS>
I
observe
here
my
old
friend
display
less
courage
than
I
expect
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
seem
entirely
swallow
up
in
despair
.
<EOS>
but
Heaven
be
praise
!
<EOS>
we
be
all
at
last
preserve

the
storm
,
after
above
eleven
hour
'
continuance
,
begin
to
abate
,
and
by
degree
entirely
cease
,

leave
us
still
roll
at
the
mercy
of
the
wave
,
which
carry
us
at
their
own
pleasure
to
the
south
-
east
a
vast
number
of
league

<EOS>
Our
crew
be
all
dead
drunk
with
the
brandy
which
they
have
take
such
care
to
preserve
from
the
sea
;
but
,
indeed
,
have
they
be
awake
,
their
labour
would
have
be
of
very
little
service
,
as
we
have
lose
all
our
rigging
,
our
brigantine
be
reduce
to
a
naked
hulk
only

<EOS>
in
this
condition
we
float
above
thirty
hour
,
till
in
the
midst
of
a
very
dark
night
we
spy
a
light
,
which
seem
to
approach
us
,
grow
so
large
that
our
sailor
conclude
it
to
be
the
lantern
of
a
man
of
war
;
but
when
we
be
cheer
ourselves
with
the
hope
of
our
deliverance
from
this
wretched
situation
,
on
a
sudden
,
to
our
great
concern
,
the
light
entirely
disappear
,
and
leave
us
in
despair
encrease
by
the
remembrance
of
those
pleasing
imagination
with
which
we
have
entertain
our
mind
during
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
night
we
pass
in
melancholy
conjecture
on
the
light
which
have
desert
us
,
which
the
major
part
of
the
sailor
conclude
to
be
a
meteor
.
<EOS>
in
this
distress
we
have
one
comfort
,
which
be
a
plentiful
store
of
provision
;
this
so
support
the
spirit
of
the
sailor
,
that
they
declare
have
they
but
a
sufficient
quantity
of
brandy
<EOS>
they
care
not
whether
they
see
land
for
a
month
to
come
;
but
indeed
we
be
much
near
<EOS>
it
than
we
imagine
,
as
we
perceive
at
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
knowing
of
the
crew
declare
we
be
near
the
continent
of
Africa
;
but
when
we
be
within
three
league
of
it
a
second
violent
storm
arise
from
the
north
,
so
that
we
again
give
over
all
hope
of
safety
.
<EOS>
this
storm
be
not
quite
so
outrageous
as
the
former
,
but
of
much
long
continuance
,
for
it
last
near
three
day
,
and
drive
us
an
immense
number
of
league
to
the
south
.
<EOS>
We
be
within
a
league
of
the
shore
,
expect
every
moment
our
ship
to
be
dash
in
piece
,
when
the
temp
cease
all
on
a
sudden
;
but
the
wave
still
continue
to
roll
like
mountain
,
and
before
the
sea
recover
its
calm
motion
,
our
ship
be
throw
so
near
the
land
,
that
the
captain
order
out
his
boat
,
declare
he
have
scarce
any
hope
of
save
her
;
and
indeed
we
have
not
quit
her
many
minute
before
we
see
the
justice
of
his
apprehension
,
for
she
strike
against
a
rock
and
immediately
sink
.
<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
the
sailor
on
this
occasion
very
much
affect
me
;
they
beheld
their
ship
perish
with
the
tenderness
of
a
lover
or
a
parent
;
they
speak
of
her
as
the
fond
husband
would
of
his
wife
;
and
many
of
them
,
who
seem
to
have
no
tear
in
their
composition
,
shed
them
plentifully
at
her
sinking
.
<EOS>
the
captain
himself
cry
out
,
"
go
thy
way
,
charm
<EOS>
Molly
,
the
sea
never
devour
a
lovelier
morsel
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
fifty
vessel
<EOS>
I
shall
never
love
another
like
thee
.
<EOS>
poor
slut
!
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
thee
to
my
die
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
the
boat
now
convey
us
all
safe
to
shore
,
where
we
land
with
very
little
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
about
noon
,
and
the
ray
of
the
sun
,
which
descend
almost
perpendicular
on
our
head
,
be
extremely
hot
and
troublesome
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
travel
through
this
extreme
heat
about
five
mile
over
a
plain
.
<EOS>
this
bring
us
to
a
vast
wood
,
which
extend
itself
as
far
as
we
could
see
,
both
to
the
right
and
leave
,
and
seem
to
me
to
put
an
entire
end
to
our
progress
.
<EOS>
here
we
decreed
to
rest
and
dine
on
the
provision
which
we
have
bring
from
the
ship
,
of
which
we
have
sufficient
for
very
few
meal
;
our
boat
be
so
overloaded
with
people
that
we
have
very
little
room
for
luggage
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
Our
repast
be
salt
pork
broil
,
which
the
keenness
of
hunger
make
so
delicious
to
my
companion
that
they
feed
very
heartily
upon
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
the
fatigue
of
my
body
and
the
vexation
of
my
mind
have
so
thoroughly
weaken
me
,
that
I
be
almost
entirely
deprive
of
appetite
;
and
the
utmost
dexterity
of
the
most
accomplished
french
cook
would
have
be
ineffectual
<EOS>
have
he
endeavour
to
tempt
me
with
delicacy
.
<EOS>
I
think
myself
very
little
a
gainer
by
my
late
escape
from
the
temp
,
by
which
I
seem
only
to
have
exchange
the
element
in
which
I
be
presently
to
die
.
<EOS>
when
our
company
have
sufficiently
,
and
indeed
very
plentifully
feast
themselves
,
they
resolve
to
enter
the
wood
and
endeavour
to
pass
it
,
in
expectation
of
find
some
inhabitant
,
at
least
some
provision
.
<EOS>
We
proceed
therefore
in
the
follow
order
:
one
man
in
the
front
with
a
hatchet
,
to
clear
our
way
,
and
two
other
follow
him
with
gun
,
to
protect
the
rest
from
wild
beast
;
then
walk
the
rest
of
our
company
,
and
last
of
all
the
captain
himself
,
be
armed
likewise
with
a
gun
,
to
defend
us
from
any
attack
behind
 
in
the
rear
,
I
think
you
call
it
.
<EOS>
and
thus
our
whole
company
,
be
fourteen
in
number
,
travel
on
till
night
overtook
us
,
without
see
anything
unless
a
few
bird
and
some
very
insignificant
animal
.
<EOS>
We
rest
all
night
under
the
covert
of
some
tree
,
and
indeed
we
very
little
wanted
shelter
at
that
season
,
the
heat
in
the
day
be
the
only
inclemency
we
have
to
combat
with
in
this
climate
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
tell
you
my
old
friend
lie
still
near
me
on
the
ground
,
and
declare
he
would
be
my
protector
<EOS>
should
any
of
the
sailor
offer
rudeness
;
but
I
can
acquit
them
of
any
such
attempt
;
nor
be
I
ever
affront
by
any
one
,
more
than
with
a
coarse
expression
,
proceed
rather
from
the
roughness
and
ignorance
of
their
education
than
from
any
abandon
principle
,
or
want
of
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
now
proceed
very
little
way
on
our
next
day
's
march
when
one
of
the
sailor
,
have
skipt
nimbly
up
a
hill
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
speak
trumpet
inform
us
that
he
see
a
town
a
very
little
way
off
.
<EOS>
this
news
so
comfort
me
,
and
give
me
such
strength
,
as
well
as
spirit
,
that
,
with
the
help
of
my
old
friend
and
another
,
who
suffer
me
to
lean
on
them
,
I
,
with
much
difficulty
,
attain
the
summit
;
but
be
so
absolutely
overcome
in
climb
it
,
that
I
have
no
longer
sufficient
strength
to
support
my
tottering
limb
,
and
be
oblige
to
lay
myself
again
on
the
ground
;
nor
could
they
prevail
on
me
to
undertake
descend
through
a
very
thick
wood
into
a
plain
,
at
the
end
of
which
indeed
appear
some
house
,
or
rather
hut
,
but
at
a
much
great
distance
than
the
sailor
assure
us
;
the
little
way
,
as
he
have
call
it
,
seem
to
me
full
twenty
mile
,
nor
be
it
,
I
believe
,
much
less
.
"
   
<EOS>
contain
incident
very
surprize
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
declare
he
would
,
without
delay
,
proceed
to
the
town
before
him
;
in
which
resolution
he
be
second
by
all
the
crew
;
but
when
I
could
not
be
persuade
,
nor
be
I
able
to
travel
any
farther
before
I
have
rest
myself
,
my
old
friend
protest
he
would
not
leave
me
,
but
would
stay
behind
as
my
guard
;
and
,
when
I
have
refresh
myself
with
a
little
repose
,
he
would
attend
me
to
the
town
,
which
the
captain
promise
he
would
not
leave
before
he
have
see
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
no
sooner
depart
than
(
have
first
thank
my
protector
for
his
care
of
me
)
<EOS>
I
resign
myself
to
sleep
,
which
immediately
close
my
eyelid
,
and
would
probably
have
detain
me
very
long
in
his
gentle
dominion
,
have
I
not
be
awake
with
a
squeeze
by
the
hand
by
my
guard
,
which
I
at
first
thought
intend
to
alarm
me
with
the
danger
of
some
wild
beast
;
but
I
soon
perceive
it
arise
from
a
soft
motive
,
and
that
a
gentle
swain
be
the
only
wild
beast
I
have
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
He
begin
now
to
disclose
his
passion
in
the
strong
manner
imaginable
,
indeed
with
a
warmth
rather
beyond
that
of
both
my
former
lover
,
but
as
yet
without
any
attempt
of
absolute
force
.
<EOS>
on
my
side
remonstrance
be
make
in
more
bitter
exclamation
and
reviling
than
I
have
use
to
any
,
that
villain
Wild
except
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
be
the
base
and
most
treacherous
wretch
alive
;
that
his
have
cloak
his
iniquitous
design
under
the
appearance
of
virtue
and
friendship
add
an
ineffable
degree
of
horror
to
them
;
that
I
detest
him
of
all
mankind
the
most
,
and
could
I
be
bring
to
yield
to
prostitution
<EOS>
,
he
should
be
the
last
to
enjoy
the
ruin
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
He
suffer
himself
not
to
be
provoke
by
this
language
,
but
only
change
his
manner
of
solicitation
from
flattery
to
bribery
.
<EOS>
He
unript
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
pull
forth
several
jewel
;
these
,
he
say
,
he
have
preserve
from
infinite
danger
to
the
happy
purpose
,
if
I
could
be
win
by
them
.
<EOS>
I
reject
them
often
with
the
utmost
indignation
,
till
at
last
,
cast
my
eye
,
rather
by
accident
than
design
,
on
a
diamond
necklace
,
a
thought
,
like
lightning
,
shoot
through
my
mind
,
and
,
in
an
instant
<EOS>
,
I
remember
that
this
be
the
very
necklace
you
have
sell
the
cursed
count
,
the
cause
of
all
our
misfortune
.
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
idea
into
which
this
surprize
hurry
me
prevent
my
reflecting
on
the
villain
who
then
stand
before
me
;
but
the
first
recollection
presently
tell
me
it
could
be
no
other
than
the
count
himself
,
<EOS>
the
wicked
tool
of
Wild
's
barbarity
.
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
then
my
condition
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
the
tumult
of
passion
which
then
labour
in
my
breast
?
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
be
happily
unknown
to
him
,
the
least
suspicion
on
his
side
be
altogether
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
impute
,
therefore
,
the
eagerness
with
which
I
gaze
on
the
jewel
to
a
very
wrong
cause
,
and
endeavour
to
put
as
much
additional
softness
into
his
countenance
as
he
be
able
.
<EOS>
My
fear
be
a
little
quieted
,
and
I
be
resolve
to
be
very
liberal
of
promise
,
and
hope
so
thoroughly
to
persuade
him
of
my
venality
that
he
may
,
without
any
doubt
,
be
draw
in
to
wait
the
captain
and
crew
's
return
,
who
would
,
I
be
very
certain
,
not
only
preserve
me
from
his
violence
,
but
secure
the
restoration
of
what
you
have
be
so
cruelly
rob
of
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
be
mistaken
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
,
again
perceive
symptom
of
the
utmost
disquietude
in
her
husband
's
countenance
,
cry
out
,
"
My
dear
,
do
not
you
apprehend
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
deliver
you
as
soon
as
possible
from
your
anxiety
 
when
he
perceive
I
decline
the
warmth
of
his
address
<EOS>
he
beg
me
to
consider
;
he
change
at
once
his
voice
and
feature
,
and
,
in
a
very
different
tone
from
what
he
have
hitherto
affect
,
he
swear
I
should
not
deceive
him
as
I
have
the
captain
;
that
fortune
have
kindly
throw
an
opportunity
in
his
way
which
he
be
resolve
not
foolishly
to
lose
;
and
conclude
with
a
violent
oath
that
he
be
determined
to
enjoy
me
that
moment
,
and
therefore
I
know
the
consequence
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
He
then
catch
me
in
his
arm
,
and
begin
such
rude
attempt
,
that
I
skreame
out
with
all
the
force
I
could
,
though
I
have
so
little
hope
of
be
rescue
,
when
there
suddenly
rush
forth
from
a
thicket
a
creature
which
,
at
his
first
appearance
,
and
in
the
hurry
of
spirit
<EOS>
I
then
be
,
I
do
not
take
for
a
man
;
but
,
indeed
,
have
he
be
the
fierce
of
wild
beast
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
rejoice
at
his
devour
us
both
.
<EOS>
I
scarce
perceive
he
have
a
musket
in
his
hand
before
he
strike
my
ravish
such
a
blow
with
it
that
he
fell
him
at
my
foot
.
<EOS>
He
then
advance
with
a
gentle
air
towards
me
,
and
tell
me
in
French
he
be
extremely
glad
he
have
be
luckily
present
to
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
be
naked
,
except
his
middle
and
his
foot
,
if
I
can
call
a
body
so
which
be
cover
with
hair
almost
equal
to
any
beast
whatever
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
his
appearance
be
so
horrid
in
my
eye
,
that
the
friendship
he
have
shew
me
,
as
well
as
his
courteous
behaviour
,
could
not
entirely
remove
the
dread
I
have
conceive
from
his
figure
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
see
this
very
visibly
;
for
he
beg
me
not
to
be
frighten
,
since
,
whatever
accident
have
bring
me
thither
,
I
should
have
reason
to
thank
heaven
for
meet
him
,
at
whose
hand
I
may
assure
myself
of
the
utmost
civility
and
protection
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
consternation
,
I
have
spirit
enough
to
take
up
the
casket
of
jewel
which
the
villain
,
in
fall
,
have
drop
out
of
his
hand
,
and
convey
it
into
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
My
deliverer
,
tell
me
that
I
seem
extremely
weak
and
faint
,
desire
me
to
refresh
myself
at
his
little
hut
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
hard
by
.
<EOS>
if
his
demeanour
have
be
less
kind
and
obliging
,
my
desperate
situation
must
have
lend
me
confidence
;
for
sure
the
alternative
could
not
be
doubtful
,
whether
I
should
rather
trust
this
man
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
savage
outside
,
express
so
much
devotion
to
serve
me
,
which
at
least
I
be
not
certain
of
the
falsehood
of
,
or
should
abide
with
one
whom
I
so
perfectly
well
know
to
be
an
accomplished
villain
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
commit
myself
to
his
guidance
,
though
with
tear
in
my
eye
,
and
beg
him
to
have
compassion
on
my
innocence
,
which
be
absolutely
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
treatment
he
have
be
witness
of
,
which
he
suppose
be
from
one
who
have
break
his
trust
towards
me
,
sufficiently
justify
my
suspicion
;
but
beg
me
to
dry
my
eye
,
and
he
would
soon
convince
me
that
I
be
with
a
man
of
different
sentiment
.
<EOS>
the
kind
accent
which
accompany
these
word
give
me
some
comfort
,
which
be
assist
by
the
repossession
of
our
jewel
by
an
accident
so
strongly
savour
of
the
disposition
of
Providence
in
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
leave

together
to
his
hut
,
or
rather
cave
,
for
it
be
under
ground
,
on
the
side
of
a
hill
;
the
situation
be
very
pleasant
,
and
from
its
mouth
we
overlook
a
large
plain
and
the
town
I
have
before
see
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
enter
it
,
he
desire
me
to
sit
down
on
a
bench
of
earth
,
which
serve
him
for
chair
,
and
then
lay
before
me
some
fruit
,
the
wild
product
of
that
country
,
one
or
two
of
which
have
an
excellent
flavour
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
produce
some
bake
flesh
,
a
little
resembling
that
of
venison
.
<EOS>
He
then
bring
forth
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
which
he
say
have
remain
with
him
ever
since
his
settling
there
,
now
above
thirty
year
,
during
all
which
time
he
have
never
open
it
,
<EOS>
his
only
liquor
be
water
;
that
he
have
reserve
this
bottle
as
a
cordial
in
sickness
;
but
,
he
thank
heaven
,
he
have
never
yet
have
occasion
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
acquaint
me
that
he
be
a
hermit
,
that
he
have
be
formerly
cast
away
on
that
coast
,
with
his
wife
,
whom
he
dearly
love
,
but
could
not
preserve
from
perish
;
on
which
account
he
have
resolve
never
to
return
to
France
,
which
be
his
native
country
,
but
to
devote
himself
to
prayer
and
a
holy
life
,
place
all
his
hope
in
the
blessed
expectation
of
meet
that
dear
woman
again
in
heaven
,
where
,
he
be
convince
,
she
be
now
a
saint
and
an
interceder
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
exchange
a
watch
with
the
king
of
that
country
,
whom
he
describe
to
be
a
very
just
and
good
man
,
for
a
gun
,
some
powder
,
shot
,
and
ball
,
with
which
he
sometimes
provide
himself
food
,
but
more
generally
use
it
in
defend
himself
against
wild
beast
;
so
that
his
diet
be
chiefly
of
the
vegetable
kind
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
many
more
circumstance
,
which
I
may
relate
to
you
hereafter
:
but
,
to
be
as
concise
as
possible
at
present
,
he
at
length
greatly
comfort
me
by
promise
to
conduct
me
to
a
seaport
,
where
I
may
have
an
opportunity
to
meet
with
some
vessel
traffic
for
slave
;
and
whence
I
may
once
more
commit
myself
to
that
element
which
,
though
I
have
already
suffer
so
much
on
it
,
I
must
again
trust
to
put
me
in
possession
of
all
I
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
character
he
give
me
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
town
we
see
below
us
,
and
of
their
king
,
make
me
desirous
of
be
conduct
thither
;
especially
as
I
very
much
wish
to
see
the
captain
and
sailor
,
who
have
behave
very
kindly
to
me
,
and
with
whom
,
notwithstanding
all
the
civil
behaviour
of
the
hermit
,
I
be
rather
easy
in
my
mind
than
alone
with
this
single
man
;
but
he
dissuade
me
greatly
from
attempt
such
a
walk
till
I
have
recruit
my
spirit
with
rest
,
desire
me
to
repose
myself
on
his
couch
or
bank
,
say
that
he
himself
would
retire
without
the
cave
,
where
he
would
remain
as
my
guard
.
<EOS>
I
accept
this
kind
proposal
,
but
it
be
long
before
I
could
procure
any
slumber
;
however
,
at
length
,
weariness
prevail
over
my
fear
,
and
I
enjoy
several
hour
'
sleep
.
<EOS>
when
I
awake
I
find
my
faithful
centinel
on
his
post
and
ready
at
my
summon
.
<EOS>
this
behaviour
infuse
some
confidence
into
me
,
and
I
now
repeat
my
request
that
he
would
go
with
me
to
the
town
below
;
but
he
answer
,
it
would
be
better
advise
to
take
some
repast
before
I
undertake
the
journey
,
which
I
should
find
much
longer
than
it
appear
.
<EOS>
I
consent
,
and
he
set
forth
a
great
variety
of
fruit
than
before
,
of
which
I
eat
very
plentifully
.
<EOS>
My
collation
be
end
,
I
renew
the
mention
of
my
walk
,
but
he
still
persist
in
dissuade
me
,
tell
me
that
I
be
not
yet
strong
enough
;
that
I
could
repose
myself
nowhere
with
great
safety
than
in
his
cave
;
and
that
,
for
his
part
,
he
could
have
no
great
happiness
than
that
of
attend
me
,
add
,
with
a
sigh
<EOS>
,
it
be
a
happiness
he
should
envy
any
other
more
than
all
the
gift
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
I
begin
now
to
entertain
suspicion
;
but
he
presently
remove
all
doubt
by
throw
himself
at
my
foot
and
express
the
warm
passion
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
now
sink
with
despair
have
he
not
accompany
these
profession
with
the
most
vehement
protestation
that
he
would
never
offer
me
any
other
force
but
that
of
entreaty
,
and
that
he
would
rather
die
the
most
cruel
death
by
my
coldness
than
gain
the
high
bliss
by
become
the
occasion
of
a
tear
of
sorrow
to
these
bright
eye
,
which
he
say
be
star

under
whose
benign
influence
alone
he
could
enjoy

indeed
suffer
life

She

her

when
a
horrid
uproar
,
which
alarm
the
whole

put
a
stop
to
her
narration
at

.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
give
the

a
well
idea
of
the

by

but
a
very
few
pace
before
one
of
the
sailor
say
to
his
comrade
,
"
D####n
me
,
Jack
,
who
know
whether
yon
fellow
hath
not
some
good
flip
in
his
cave
?
<EOS>
"
I
innocently
answer
,
the
poor
wretch
hath
only
one
bottle
of
brandy
.
"
<EOS>
Hath
he
so
?
<EOS>
"
cry
the
sailor
;
"
'
fore
George
,
we
will
taste
it
;
"
and
so
say
they
immediately
return
back
,
and
myself
with
them
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
poor
man
prostrate
on
the
ground
,
express
all
the
symptom
of
misery
and
lamentation
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
in
French
(
for
the
sailor
could
not
speak
that
language
)
what
they
want
.
<EOS>
He
point
to
the
place
where
the
bottle
be
deposit
,
say
they
be
welcome
to
that
and
whatever
else
he
have
,
and
add
he
care
not
if
they
take
his
life
also
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
search
the
whole
cave
,
where
find
nothing
more
which
they
deem
worth
their
taking
,
they
walk
off
with
the
bottle
,
and
,
immediately
empty
it
without
offer
me
a
drop
,
they
proceed
with
me
towards
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
our
way
I
observe
one
whisper
another
,
while
he
keep
his
eye
stedfastly
fix
on
me
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
some
uneasiness
;
but
the
other
answer
,
"
no
,
d####n
me
,
the
captain
will
never
forgive
us
:
besides
,
we
have
enough
of
it
among
the
black
woman
,
and
,
in
my
mind
,
one
colour
be
as
good
as
another
.
"
<EOS>
this
be
enough
to
give
me
violent
apprehension
;
but
I
hear
no
more
of
that
kind
till
we
come
to
the
town
,
where
,
in
about
six
hour
,
I
arrive
in
safety
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
I
come
to
the
captain
he
enquire
what
be
become
of
my
friend
,
mean
the
villanous
count
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
inform
by
me
of
what
have
happen
,
he
wish
me
heartily
joy
of
my
delivery
,
and
,
express
the
utmost
abhorrence
of
such
baseness
,
swear
if
ever
he
meet
him
he
would
cut
his
throat
;
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
we
both
conclude
that
he
have
die
of
the
blow
which
the
hermit
have
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
now
introduce
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
this
country
,
who
be
desirous
of
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
short
description
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
choose
(
as
be
the
custom
there
)
for
his
superior
bravery
and
wisdom
.
<EOS>
His
power
be
entirely
absolute
during
his
continuance
;
but
,
on
the
first
deviation
from
equity
and
justice
,
he
be
liable
to
be
depose
and
punish
by
the
people
,
the
elder
of
whom
,
once
a
year
assemble
to
examine
into
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
besides
the
danger
which
these
examination
,
which
be
very
strict
,
expose
him
to
,
his
office
be
of
such
care
and
trouble
that
nothing
but
that
restless
love
of
power
so
predominant
in
the
mind
of
man
could
make
it
the
object
of
desire
,
for
he
be
indeed
the
only
slave
of
all
the
native
of
this
country
.
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
,
in
time
of
peace
,
to
hear
the
complaint
of
every
person
in
his
dominion
and
to
render
him
justice
;
for
which
purpose
every
one
may
demand
an
audience
of
him
,
unless
during
the
hour
which
he
be
allow
for
dinner
,
when
he
sit
alone
at
the
table
,
and
be
attend
in
the
most
public
manner
with
more
than
european
ceremony
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
to
create
an
awe
and
respect
towards
him
in
the
eye
of
the
vulgar
;
but
lest
it
should
elevate
him
too
much
in
his
own
opinion
,
in
order
to
his
humiliation
he
receive
every
evening
in
private
,
from
a
kind
of
beadle
,
a
gentle
kick
on
his
posterior
;
besides
which
he
wear
a
ring
in
his
nose
,
somewhat
resemble
that
we
ring
our
pig
with
,
and
a
chain
round
his
neck
not
unlike
that
wear
by
our
alderman
;
both
which
I
suppose
to
be
emblematical
,
but
hear
not
the
reason
of
either
assign
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
more
particularity
among
these
people
which
,
when
I
have
an
opportunity
,
I
may
relate
to
you
.
<EOS>
the
second
day
after
my
return
from
court
one
of
his
officer
,
whom
they
call
SCHACH
PIMPACH
,
wait
upon
me
,
and
,
by
a
french
interpreter
who
live
here
,
inform
me
that
the
chief
magistrate
like
my
person
,
and
offer
me
an
immense
present
if
I
would
suffer
him
to
enjoy
it
(
this
be
,
it
seem
,
their
common
form
of
make
love
)
.
<EOS>
I
reject
the
present
,
and
never
hear
any
further
solicitation
;
for
,
as
it
be
no
shame
for
woman
here
to
consent
at
the
first
proposal
,
so
they
never
receive
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
reside
in
this
town
a
week
when
the
captain
inform
me
that
a
number
of
slave
,
who
have
be
take
captive
in
war
,
be
to
be
guard
to
the
sea
-
side
,
where
they
be
to
be
sell
to
the
merchant
who
trade
in
them
to
America
;
that
if
I
would
embrace
this
opportunity
I
may
assure
myself
of
find
a
passage
to
America
,
and
thence
to
England
;
acquaint
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
himself
intend
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
readily
agree
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
the
chief
,
be
advertise
of
our
design
,
send
for
us
both
to
court
,
and
,
without
mention
a
word
of
love
to
me
,
have
present
me
with
a
very
rich
jewel
,
of
less
value
,
he
say
,
than
my
chastity
,
take
a
very
civil
leave
,
recommend
me
to
the
care
of
heaven
,
and
order
us
a
large
supply
of
provision
for
our
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
provide
with
mule
for
ourselves
and
what
we
carry
with
us
,
and
in
nine
day
reach
the
sea
-
shore
,
where
we
find
an
english
vessel
ready
to
receive
both
us
and
the
slave
.
<EOS>
We
go
aboard
it
,
and
sail
the
next
day
with
a
fair
wind
for
New
England
,
where
I
hope
to
get
an
immediate
passage
to
the
Old
:
but
Providence
be
kind
than
my
expectation
;
for
the
third
day
after
we
be
at
sea
we
meet
an
english
man
-
of
-
war
homeward
bind
;
the
captain
of
it
be
a
very
good
-
natured
man
,
and
agree
to
take
me
on
board
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
take
my
leave
of
my
old
friend
,
the
master
of
the
shipwreck
vessel
,
who
go
on
to
New
England
,
whence
he
intend
to
pass
to
Jamaica
,
where
his
owner
live
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
treat
with
great
civility
,
have
a
little
cabin
assign
me
,
and
dine
every
day
at
the
captain
's
table
,
who
be
indeed
a
very
gallant
man
,
and
at
first
,
make
me
a
tender
of
his
affection
;
but
,
when
he
find
me
resolutely
bent
to
preserve
myself
pure
and
entire
for
the
good
of
husband
,
he
grow
cool
in
his
address
,
and
soon
behave
in
a
manner
very
pleasing
to
me
,
regard
my
sex
only
so
far
as
to
pay
me
a
deference
,
which
be
very
agreeable
to
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
conclude
my
story
;
I
meet
with
no
adventure
in
this
passage
at
all
worth
relate
,
till
my
landing
at
Gravesend
,
whence
the
captain
bring
me
in
his
own
boat
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
in
a
short
hour
after
my
arrival
we
have
that
meeting
which
,
however
dreadful
at
first
,
will
,
I
now
hope
,
by
the
good
office
of
the
good
of
man
,
whom
Heaven
for
ever
bless
,
end
in
our
perfect
happiness
,
and
be
a
strong
instance
of
what
I
be
persuade
be
the
sure
truth
,
that
PROVIDENCE
WILL
SOONER
or
<EOS>
later
procure
the
felicity
of
the
VIRTUOUS
and
INNOCENT
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heartfree
thus
end
her
speech
,
have
before
deliver
to
her
husband
the
jewel
which
the
count
have
rob
him
of
,
and
that
present
her
by
the
african
chief
,
which
last
be
of
immense
value
.
<EOS>
the
good
magistrate
be
sensibly
touch
at
her
narrative
,
as
well
on
the
consideration
of
the
suffering
she
have
herself
undergo
as
for
those
of
her
husband
,
<EOS>
which
he
have
himself
be
innocently
the
instrument
of
bring
upon
him
.
<EOS>
that
worthy
man
,
however
,
much
rejoice
in
what
he
have
already
do
for
his
preservation
,
and
promise
to
labour
with
his
utmost
interest
and
industry
to
procure
the
absolute
pardon
,
rather
of
his
sentence
than
of
his
guilt
,
which
he
now
plainly
discover
be
a
barbarous
and
false
imputation
.
   
<EOS>
the
history
return
to
the
CONTEMPLATION
of
GREATNESS
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
already
,
perhaps
,
detain
our
reader
too
long
in
this
relation
from
the
consideration
of
our
hero
,
who
daily
give
the
most
exalted
proof
of
greatness
in
cajole
the
prig
,
and
in
exaction
on
the
debtor
;
which
latter
now
grow
so
great
,
i.
e.
,
corrupt
in
their
moral
,
that
they
speak
with
the
utmost
contempt
of
what
the
vulgar
call
honesty
.
<EOS>
the
great
character
among
them
be
that
of
a
pickpocket
,
or
,
in
true
language
,
a
file
;
and
the
only
censure
be
want
of
dexterity
.
<EOS>
as
to
virtue
,
goodness
,
and
such
like
,
they
be
the
object
of
mirth
and
derision
,
and
all
Newgate
be
a
complete
collection
of
prig
,
every
man
be
desirous
to
pick
his
neighbour
's
pocket
,
and
every
one
be
as
sensible
that
his
neighbour
be
as
ready
to
pick
his
;
so
that
(
which
be
almost
incredible
)
<EOS>
as
great
roguery
be
daily
commit
within
the
wall
of
Newgate
as
without
.
  
<EOS>
the
glory
result
from
these
action
of
Wild
probably
animate
the
envy
of
his
enemy
against
him
.
<EOS>
the
day
of
his
trial
now
approach
;
for
which
,
as
Socrates
do
,
he
prepare
himself
;
but
not
weakly
and
foolishly
,
like
that
philosopher
,
with
patience
and
resignation
,
but
with
a
good
number
of
false
witness
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
success
be
not
always
proportion
to
the
wisdom
of
him
who
endeavour
to
attain
it
,
so
be
we
more
sorry
than
ashamed
to
relate
that
our
hero
be
,
notwithstanding
his
utmost
caution
and
prudence
,
convict
,
and
sentence
to
a
death
which
,
when
we
consider
not
only
the
great
man
who
have
suffer
it
,
but
the
much
large
number
of
those
whose
high
honour
it
hath
be
to
merit
it
,
we
can
not
call
otherwise
than
honourable
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
those
who
have
unluckily
miss
it
seem
all
their
day
to
have
labour
in
vain
to
attain
an
end
which
Fortune
,
for
reason
only
know
to
herself
,
hath
think
proper
to
deny
them
.
<EOS>
without
any
farther
preface
then
,
our
hero
be
sentence
to
be
hang
by
the
neck
:
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
be
to
be
now
his
fate
,
he
may
console
himself
that
he
have
perpetrate
what
      
n
ec
Judicis
ira
,
nec
ignis
.
   
<EOS>
Nec
poterit
ferrum
,
nec
edax
abolera
vetustas
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
confess
,
I
look
on
this
death
of
hang
to
be
as
proper
for
a
hero
as
any
other
;
and
I
solemnly
declare
that
have
<EOS>
Alexander
the
Great
be
hang
<EOS>
it
would
not
in
the
least
have
diminish
my
respect
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
provide
a
hero
in
his
life
doth
but
execute
a
sufficient
quantity
of
mischief
;
provide
he
be
<EOS>
but
well
and
heartily
curse
by
the
widow
,
the
orphan
,
the
poor
,
and
the
oppress
(
the
sole
reward
,
as
many
author
have
bitterly
lament
both
in
prose
and
verse
,
of
greatness
,
i.
e.
,
priggism
)
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
avail
little
of
what
nature
his
death
be
,
whether
it
be
by
the
axe
,
the
halter
,
or
the
sword
.
<EOS>
such
name
will
be
always
sure
of
live
to
posterity
,
and
of
enjoy
that
fame
which
they
so
gloriously
and
eagerly
covet
;
for
,
accord
to
a
great
dramatic
poet
     
<EOS>
Fame
     
<EOS>
not

from
good

evil
deed

ephesian
dome
   
outlive
in
fame
<EOS>
the
pious
fool
who
rais'd
it
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
now
suspect
that
the
malice
of
his
enemy
would
overpower
him
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
betook
himself
to
that
true
support
of
greatness
in
affliction
,
a
bottle
;
by
mean
of
which
he
be
enable
to
curse
,
swear
,
and
bully
,
and
brave
his
fate
.
<EOS>
other
comfort
<EOS>
indeed
he
have
not
much
,
for
not
a
single
friend
<EOS>
ever
come
near
him
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
whose
trial
be
defer
to
the
next
session
,
visit
him
but
once
,
when
she
plague
,
torment
,
and
upbraid
him
so
cruelly
,
that
he
forbad
the
keeper
ever
to
admit
her
again
.
<EOS>
the
ordinary
of
Newgate
have
frequent
conference
with
him
,
and
greatly
would
it
embellish
our
history
could
we
record
all
which
that
good
man
deliver
on
these
occasion
;
but
unhappily
we
could
procure
only
the
substance
of
a
single
conference
,
which
be
take
down
in
shorthand
by
one
who
overhear
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
transcribe
it
therefore
exactly
in
the
same
form
and
word
we
receive
it
;
nor
can
we
help
regard
it
as
one
of
the
most
curious
piece
which
either
ancient

modern
history
hath
record

it

observe

oblige
to
exert

many

why

it
must
be
confess
that
there

you
should
not
censure
too
generally

<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
may
have
expect
high
promotion

but
I
have
learn
patience
and
resignation

and
I
would
advise
you
to
the
same
temper
of
mind

which
if
you
can
attain
,
I
know
you
will
find
mercy

<EOS>
nay

I
do

promise

you

<EOS>
It
be
true
you
be
a
sinner

but
your
crime
be
not
of
the
black
dye

you
be
no
murderer

nor
guilty
of
sacrilege

<EOS>
and
,
if
you
be
guilty
of
theft

you
make
some
atonement
by
suffer
for
it

which
many
other
do
not

<EOS>
happy

it
indeed
for
those
few
who
be
detect
in
their
sin

and
bring
to
exemplary
punishment
for
them

<EOS>
so
far
,
therefore
,
from
repine
at
your
fate
when
you
come
to
the
tree
,
you
should
exult
and
rejoice
in
it
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth

I
question
whether
,
to
a
wise
man
,
the
catastrophe
of
many
of
those
who
die
by
a
halter
be
not
more

envy

<EOS>
nothing
be
so
sinful
as
sin

and
murder
be
the
great
of
all
sin

<EOS>
It
follow
,
that
whoever
commit
murder
be
happy
in
suffer
for
it
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
a
man
who
commit
murder
be
so
happy
in
die
for
it

how
much
better
must
it
be
for
you

who
have
commit
a
less
crime

<EOS>
JONATHAN

<EOS>
all
this
be
very
true

but
let
us
take
a
bottle
of
wine
to
cheer
our
spirit

<EOS>
ordinary

<EOS>
why
wine

<EOS>
let
me
tell
you

Mr.

there
be
nothing
so
deceitful

the

give
us
by
wine

<EOS>
if
you
must
drink

let
us
have
a
bowl
of
punch
 
<EOS>
a
liquor
I
the
rather
prefer

as
it
be
nowhere
speak
against
in

and
as
it
be
more
wholesome

I

grievously
afflict

<EOS>
JONATHAN
(
have
call

<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
,
doctor

I
should
have
remember
that
punch
be
your
favourite
liquor

I
think
you
never
taste
wine

there
be
any
punch
remain
on
the
table

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
confess
I
look
on
punch
to
be
the
more
eligible
liquor

as
well
for
the
reason
I
before
mention
as
likewise

one
other

it

come

do
not

it
be

you

very

reprieve

leave

I
will
render

good
account
of
it

I
warrant
you

<EOS>
I
have
a
sermon
in
my
pocket
which
may
be
of
some
use
to
you
to
hear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
value
myself
on
the
talent
of
preaching
,
since
no
man
ought
to
value
himself
for
any
gift
in
this

but
perhaps
there
be
not
many
such
sermon

<EOS>
but
to
proceed

since
we
have
nothing
else
to
do
till
the
punch
come

<EOS>
My
text
be
the
latter
part
of
a
verse
only
:
    
t
o
the
Greeks
FOOLISHNESS
.
  
<EOS>
the
occasion
of
these
word
be
principally
that
philosophy
of
the
Greeks
which
at
that
time
have
overrun
great
part
of
the
heathen
world
,
have
poison
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
puff
up
their
mind
with
pride
,
so
that
they
disregard
all
kind
of
doctrine
in
comparison
of
their
own
;
and
,
however
safe
and
however
sound
the
learning
of
the
other
may
be
,
yet
,
if
it
anywise
contradict
their
own
law
,
custom
,
and
receive
opinion
,
away
with
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
for
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
the
Greeks
FOOLISHNESS
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
former
part
,
therefore
,
of
my
discourse
on
these
word
,
I
shall
principally
confine
myself
to
the
lay
open
and
demonstrate
the
great
emptiness
and
vanity
of
this
philosophy
,
with
which
these
idle
and
absurd
sophist
be
so
proudly
blow
up
and
elevate
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
shall
do
two
thing
:
<EOS>
first
,
I
shall
expose
the
matter
;
and
,
secondly
,
the
manner
of
this
absurd
philosophy
.
  
<EOS>
and
first
,
for
the
first
of
these
,
namely
,
the
matter
.
<EOS>
now
here
we
may
retort
the
unmannerly
word
which
our
adversary
have
audaciously
throw
in
our
face
;
for
what
be
all
this
mighty
matter
of
philosophy
,
this
heap
of
knowledge
,
which
be
to
bring
such
large
harvest
of
honour
to
those
who
sow
it
,
and
so
greatly
and
nobly
to
enrich
the
ground
on
which
it
fall
;
what
be
it
<EOS>
but
foolishness
?
<EOS>
an
inconsistent
heap
of
nonsense
,
of
absurdity
and
contradiction
,
bring
no
ornament
to
the
mind
in
its
theory
,
nor
exhibit
any
usefulness
to
the
body
in
its
practice
.
<EOS>
what
be
all
the
sermon
and
the
saving
,
the
fable
and
the
moral
of
all
these
wise
man
,
but
,
to
use
the
word
mention
in
my
text
once
more
,
FOOLISHNESS
?
<EOS>
what
be
their
great
master
Plato
,
or
their
other
great
light
Aristotle
?
<EOS>
both
fool
,
mere
quibbler
and
sophist
,
idly
and
vainly
attach
to
certain
ridiculous
notion
of
their
own
,
found
neither
on
truth
nor
on
reason
.
<EOS>
Their
whole
work
be
a
strange
medley
of
the
great
falsehood
,
scarce
cover
over
with
the
colour
of
truth
:
their
precept
be
neither
borrow
from
nature
nor
guide
by
reason
;
mere
fiction
,
serve
only
to
evince
the
dreadful
height
of
human
pride
;
in
one
word
,
FOOLISHNESS
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
perhaps
expect
of
me
that
I
should
give
some
instance
from
their
work
to
prove
this
charge
;
but
,
as
to
transcribe
every
passage
to
my
purpose
would
be
to
transcribe
their
whole
work
,
and
as
in
such
a
plentiful
crop
it
be
difficult
to
chuse
;
instead
of
trespass
on
your
patience
,
I
shall
conclude
this
first
head
with
assert
what
I
have
so
fully
prove
,
and
what
may
indeed
be
infer
from
the
text
,
that
the
philosophy
of
the
Greeks
be
foolishness
.
  
<EOS>
proceed
we
now
,
in
the
second
place
,
to
consider
the
manner
in
which
this
inane
and
simple
doctrine
be
propagate
.
<EOS>
and
here
 
<EOS>
but
here
the
punch
by
entre
wake
Mr.
Wild
,
who
be
fast
asleep
,
and
put
an
end
to
the
sermon
;
nor
could
we
obtain
any
further
account
of
the
conversation
which
pass
at
this
interview

WILD

CONSUMMATION

<EOS>
the
day
now
draw
nigh

our
great

exemplify
the
last

which
any
hero
can
signalise
himself

<EOS>
this
be
the
day
of
execution

or
consummation

or
apotheosis

for
it
be
call
by

which
be
to
give
our
hero
an
opportunity
of
face
death

damnation

without
any
fear
in
his
heart

or
,
at

without
betray

it
in

be
heartily

care
on
her
fifth
act
,
dismiss
the
hero
with
a
sneaking
and
private
exit
,
who
have
in
the
former
part
of
the
drama
perform
such
notable
exploit
as
must
promise
to
every
good
judge
among
the
spectator
a
noble
,
public
,
and
exalted
end
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
resolve
to
commit
no
such
error
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
too
much
and
too
deservedly
her
favourite
to
be
neglect
by
her
in
his
last
moment
;
accordingly
all
effort
for
a
reprieve
be
vain
,
and
the
name
of
Wild
stand
at
the
head
of
those
who
be
order
for
execution
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
time
he
give
over
all
hope
of
life
,
his
conduct
be
truly
great
and
admirable
.
<EOS>
instead
of
shew
any
mark
of
dejection
or
contrition
,
he
rather
infuse
more
confidence
and
assurance
into
his
look
.
<EOS>
He
spend
most
of
his
hour
in
drink
with
his
friend
and
with
the
good
man
above
commemorate
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
compotation
,
be
ask
whether
he
be
afraid
to
die
,
he
answer
,
"
D####n
me
,
it
be
only
a
dance
without
music
.
"
<EOS>
another
time
,
when
one
express
some
sorrow
for
his
misfortune
,
as
he
term
it
,
he
say
with
great
fierceness
 
<EOS>
"
a
man
can
die
but
once
.
"
<EOS>
again
,
when
one
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
hint
his
hope
,
that
he
would
die
like
a
man
,
he
cock
his
hat
in
defiance
,
and
cry
out
greatly
 
"
zounds
!
<EOS>
who
be
afraid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Happy
would
it
have
be
for
posterity
,
could
we
have
retrieve
any
entire
conversation
which
pass
at
this
season
,
especially
between
our
hero
and
his
learned
comforter
;
but
we
have
search
many
pasteboard
record
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
eve
of
his
apotheosis
,
Wild
's
lady
desire
to
see
him
,
to
which
he
consent
.
<EOS>
this
meeting
be
at
first
very
tender
on
both
side
;
but
it
could
not
continue
so
,
for
unluckily
,
some
hint
of
former
miscarriage
intervene
,
as
particularly
when
she
ask
him
how
he
could
have
use
her
so
barbarously
once
as
call
her
b
#
#
#
#
,
and
whether
such
language
become
a
man
,
much
less
a
gentleman
,
Wild
fly
into
a
violent
passion
,
and
swear
she
be
the
vilest
of
b####s
to
upbraid
him
at
such
a
season
with
an
unguarded
word
speak
long
ago
.
<EOS>
She
reply
,
with
many
tear
,
she
be
well
enough
serve
for
her
folly
in
visit
such
a
brute
;
but
she
have
one
comfort
,
however
,
that
it
would
be
the
last
time
he
could
ever
treat
her
so
;
that
indeed
she
have
some
obligation
to
him
,
for
that
his
cruelty
to
her
would
reconcile
her
to
the
fate
he
be
to
-
morrow
to
suffer
;
and
,
indeed
,
nothing
but
such
brutality
could
have
make
the
consideration
of
his
shameful
death
(
so
<EOS>
this
weak
woman
call
hanging
)
,
which
be
now
inevitable
,
to
be
bear
even
without
madness
.
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
a
recapitulation
of
his
fault
in
an
exacter
order
,
and
with
more
perfect
memory
,
than
one
would
have
imagine
her
capable
of
;
and
it
be
probable
would
have
rehearse
a
complete
catalogue
have
not
our
hero
's
patience
fail
him
,
so
that
with
the
utmost
fury
and
violence
he
catch
her
by
the
hair
and
kick
her
,
as
heartily
as
his
chain
would
suffer
him
,
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
morning
come
which
Fortune
at
his
birth
have
resolutely
ordain
for
the
consummation
of
our
hero
's
GREATNESS
:
he
have
himself
indeed
modestly
decline
the
public
honour
she
intend
him
,
and
have
take
a
quantity
of
laudanum
,
in
order
to
retire
quietly
off
the
stage
;
but
we
have
already
observe
,
in
the
course
of
our
wonderful
history
,
that
to
struggle
against
this
lady
's
decree
be
vain
and
impotent
;
and
whether
she
hath
determine
you
shall
be
hang
or
be
a
prime
minister
,
it
be
in
either
case
lose
labour
to
resist
.
<EOS>
Laudanum
,
therefore
,
be
unable
to
stop
the
breath
of
our
hero
,
which
the
fruit
of
hemp
-
seed
,
and
not
the
spirit
of
poppy
-
seed
,
be
to
overcome
,
he
be
at
the
usual
hour
attend
by
the
proper
gentleman
appoint
for
that
purpose
,
and
acquaint
that
the
cart
be
ready
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
exert
that
greatness
of
courage
which
hath
be
so
much
celebrate
in
other
hero
;
and
,
know
it
be
impossible
to
resist
,
he
gravely
declare
he
would
attend
them
.
<EOS>
He
then
descend
to
that
room
where
the
fetter
of
great
man
be
knock
off
in
a
most
solemn
and
ceremonious
manner
.
<EOS>
then
shake
hand
with
his
friend
(
to
wit
,
those
who
be
conduct
him
to
the
tree
)
,
and
drink
their
health
in
a
bumper
of
brandy
,
he
ascend
the
cart
,
where
he
be
no
sooner
seated
than
he
receive
the
acclamation
of
the
multitude
,
who
be
highly
ravish
with
his
GREATNESS
.
  
<EOS>
the
cart
now
move
slowly
on
,
be
precede
by
a
troop
of
horse
-
guard
bear
javelin
in
their
hand
,
through
street
line
with
crowd
all
admire
the
great
behaviour
of
our
hero
,
who
ride
on
,
sometimes
sighing
,
sometimes
swear
,
sometimes
singe
or
whistle
,
as
his
humour
vary
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
the
tree
of
glory
,
he
be
welcome
with
an
universal
shout
of
the
people
,
who
be
there
assemble
in
prodigious
number
to
behold
a
sight
much
more
rare
in
populous
city
than
one
would
reasonably
imagine
it
should
be
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
proper
catastrophe
of
a
great
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
envy
be
,
through
fear
,
oblige
to
join
the
general
voice
in
applause
on
this
occasion
,
there
be
not
want
some
who
malign
this
completion
of
glory
,
which
be
now
about
to
be
fulfil
to
our
hero
,
and
endeavour
to
prevent
it
by
knock
him
on
the
head
as
he
stand
under
the
tree
,
while
the
ordinary
be
perform
his
last
office
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
begin
to
batter
the
cart
with
stone
,
brick
-
bat
,
dirt
,
and
all
manner
of
mischievous
weapon
,
some
of
which
,
erroneously
play
on
the
robe
of
the
ecclesiastic
,
make
him
so
expeditious
in
his
repetition
,
that
with
wonderful
alacrity
he
have
end
almost
in
an
instant
,
and
convey
himself
into
a
place
of
safety
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
where
he
wait
the
compulsion
with
a
temper
of
mind
describe
in
these
verse
:
      
Suave
mari
magno
,
<EOS>
turbantibus
aequora
ventis
,
     
<EOS>
E
terra
alterius
magnum
spectare
laborem
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
not
,
however
,
omit
one
circumstance
,
as
it
serve
to
shew
the
most
admirable
conservation
of
character
in
our
hero
to
his
last
moment
,
which
be
,
that
,
whilst
the
ordinary
be
busy
in
his
ejaculation
,
Wild
,
in
the
midst
of
the
shower
of
stone
,
&
c.
,
which
play
upon
him
,
apply
his
hand
to
the
parson
's
pocket
,
and
empty
it
of
his
bottle
-
screw
,
which
he
carry
out
of
the
world
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
ordinary
being
now
descend
from
the
cart
,
Wild
have
just
opportunity
to
cast
his
eye
around
the
crowd
,
and
to
give
them
a
hearty
curse
,
when
immediately
the
horse
move
on
,
and
with
universal
applause
our
hero
swing
out
of
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
thus
fall
Jonathan
Wild
the
GREAT
,
by
a
death
as
glorious
as
his
life
have
be
,
and
which
be
so
truly
agreeable
to
it
,
that
the
latter
must
have
be
deprobably
maim
and
imperfect
without
the
former
;
a
death
which
hath
be
alone
want
to
complete
the
character
of
several
ancient
and
modern
hero
,
whose
history
would
then
have
be
read
with
much
great
pleasure
by
the
wise
in
all
age
.
<EOS>
indeed
we
could
almost
wish
that
whenever
Fortune
seem
wantonly
to
deviate
from
her
purpose
,
and
leave
her
work
imperfect
in
this
particular
,
the
historian
would
indulge
himself
in
the
license
of
poetry
and
romance
,
and
even
do
a
violence
to
truth
,
to
oblige
his
reader
with
a
page
which
must
be
the
most
delightful
in
all
his
history
,
and
which
could
never
fail
of
produce
an
instructive
moral
.
  
<EOS>
narrow
mind
may
possibly
have
some
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
go
this
way
out
of
the
world
,
if
their
conscience
can
fly
in
their
face
and
assure
them
they
have
not
merit
such
an
honour
;
but
he
must
be
a
fool
who
be
ashamed
of
be
hang
,
who
be
not
weak
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
have
deserve
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
character
of
our
hero
,
and
the
conclusion
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
now
endeavour
to
draw
the
character
of
this
great
man
;
and
,
by
bring
together
those
several
feature
as
it
be
of
his
mind
which
lie
scatter
up
and
down
in
this
history
,
to
present
our
reader
with
a
perfect
picture
of
greatness
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
have
every
qualification
necessary
to
form
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
as
his
most
powerful
and
predominant
passion
be
ambition
,
so
nature
have
,
with
consummate
propriety
,
adapt
all
his
faculty
to
the
attain
those
glorious
end
to
which
this
passion
direct
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
ingenious
in
invent
design
,
artful
in
contrive
the
mean
to
accomplish
his
purpose
,
and
resolute
in
execute
them
:
for
as
the
most
exquisite
cunning
and
most
undaunted
boldness
qualify
him
for
any
undertaking
,
so
be
he
not
restrain
by
any
of
those
weakness
which
disappoint
the
view
of
mean
and
vulgar
soul
,
and
which
be
comprehend
in
one
general
term
of
honesty
,
which
be
a
corruption
of
HONOSTY
,
a
word
derive
from
what
the
Greeks
call
an
ass
.
<EOS>
He
be
entirely
free
from
those
low
vice
of
modesty
and
good
-
nature
,
which
,
as
he
say
,
imply
a
total
negation
of
human
greatness
,
and
be
the
only
quality
which
absolutely
render
a
man
incapable
of
make
a
considerable
figure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
lust
be
inferior
only
to
his
ambition
;
but
,
as
for
what
simple
people
call
love
,
he
know
not
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
His
avarice
be
immense
,
but
it
be
of
the
rapacious
,
not
of
the
tenacious
kind
;
his
rapaciousness
be
indeed
so
violent
,
that
nothing
ever
content
him
but
the
whole
;
for
,
however
considerable
the
share
be
which
his
coadjutor
allow
him
of
a
booty
,
he
be
restless
in
invent
mean
to
make
himself
master
of
the
small
pittance
reserve
by
them
.
<EOS>
He
say
law
be
make
for
the
use
of
prigs
only
,
and
to
secure
their
property
;
they
be
never
therefore
more
perverted
than
when
their
edge
be
turn
against
these
;
but
that
this
generally
happen
through
their
want
of
sufficient
dexterity
.
<EOS>
the
character
which
he
most
value
himself
upon
,
and
which
he
principally
honour
in
other
,
be
that
of
hypocrisy
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
be
,
that
no
one
could
carry
priggism
very
far
without
it
;
for
which
reason
,
he
say
,
there
be
little
greatness
to
be
expect
in
a
man
who
acknowledge
his
vice
,
but
always
much
to
be
hope
from
him
who
profess
great
virtue
:
<EOS>
wherefore
,
though
he
would
always
shun
the
person
whom
he
discover
guilty
of
a
good
action
,
yet
he
be
never
deter
by
a
good
character
,
which
be
more
commonly
the
effect
of
profession
than
of
action
:
for
which
reason
,
he
himself
be
always
very
liberal
of
honest
profession
,
and
have
as
much
virtue
and
goodness
in
his
mouth
as
a
saint
;
never
in
the
least
scrupling
to
swear
by
his
honour
,
even
to
those
who
know
him
the
good
;
nay
,
though
he
hold
good
-
nature
and
modesty
in
the
high
contempt
,
he
constantly
practise
the
affectation
of
both
,
and
recommend
this
to
other
,
whose
welfare
,
on
his
own
account
,
he
wish
well
to
.
<EOS>
He
lay
down
several
maxim
as
the
certain
method
of
attain
greatness
,
to
which
,
in
his
own
pursuit
of
it
,
he
constantly
adhere
.
<EOS>
as
   
1
.
<EOS>
never
to
do
more
mischief
to
another
than

precious
a
thing
to
be
throw
away
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
to

<EOS>
never

of

to
forgive
no
enemy

cautious
and
often
dilatory
in
revenge

<EOS>
6

<EOS>
to

poverty
and
distress
,

himself
as
close
as
possible
to
power
and
riches
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
<EOS>
to

in
his
countenance

to

eternal

in
his

<EOS>
9

<EOS>
never

any

equal
to
his
merit

but
always

insinuate
that
the
reward

above

<EOS>
10
.
<EOS>
that
all

knave
or
fool
,
and
much
the
great
number
<EOS>
a
composition
of
both
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
<EOS>
that
a
good

must

or
at

greatly
risque

in
order
to
bring
the

any
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
<EOS>
that
virtue
,
like
precious
stone
,
be
easily
counterfeit
;
that
the
counterfeit
in
both

the
wearer
equally

sufficient
to

<EOS>

decease
find
in
his
study
,
as
the
twelve
excellent
and
celebrated
rule
be
in
that
of
king
Charles
the
first
;
for
he
never
promulgate
them
in
his
lifetime
,
not
have
them
constantly
in
his
mouth
,
as
some
grave
person
have
the
rule
of
virtue
and
morality
,
without
pay
the
least
regard
to
them
in
their
action
:
whereas
our
hero
,
by
a
constant
and
steady
adherence
to
his
rule
in
conform
everything
he
do
to
them
,
acquire
at
length
a
settled
habit
of
walk
by
them
,
till
at
last
he
be
in
no
danger
of
inadvertently
go
out
of
the
way
;
and
by
these
mean
he
arrive
at
that
degree
of
greatness
,
which
few
have
equal
;
none
,
we
may
say
,
have
exceed
:
for
,
though
it
must
be
allow
that
there
have
be
some
few
hero
,
who
have
do
great
mischief
to
mankind
,
such
as
those
who
have
betray
the
liberty
of
their
country
to
other
,
or
have
undermine
and
overpower
it
themselves
;
or
conqueror
who
have
impoverish
,
pillage
,
sack
,
burn
,
and
destroy
the
country
and
city
of
their
fellow
-
creature
,
from
no
other
provocation
than
that
of
glory
,
i.
e.
,
as
the
tragic
poet
call
it
,
             
a
privilege
to
kill
,
   
a
strong
temptation
to
do
bravely
ill
;
  
yet
,
if
we
consider
it
in
the
light
wherein
action
be
place
in
this
line
,
    
Laetius
est
,
quotie
magno
tibi
constat
honestum
;
  
when
we
see
our
hero
,
without
the
least
assistance
or
pretence
,
set
himself
at
the
head
of
a
gang
,
which
he
have
not
any
shadow
of
right
to
govern
;
if
we
view
him
maintain
absolute
power
,
and
exercise
tyranny
over
a
lawless
crew
,
contrary
to
all
law
but
that
of
his
own
will
;
if
we
consider
him
set
up
an
open
trade
publickly
,
in
defiance
not
only
of
the
law
of
his
country
but
of
the
common
sense
of
his
countryman
;
if
we
see
him
first
contrive
the
robbery
of
other
,
and
again
the
defraud
the
very
robber
of
that
booty
,
which
they
have
venture
their
neck
to
acquire
,
and
which
without
any
hazard
,
they
may
have
retain
;
here
sure
he
must
appear
admirable
,
and
we
may
challenge
not
only
the
truth
of
history
,
but
almost
the
latitude
of
fiction
,
to
equal
his
glory
.
  
<EOS>
nor
have
he
any
of
those
flaw
in
his
character
which
,
though
they
have
be
commend
by
weak
writer
,
have
(
as
I
hint
in
the
beginning
of
this
history
)
by
the
judicious
reader
be
censure
and
despise
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
clemency
of
Alexander
and
Caesar
,
which
nature
have
so
grossly
err
in
give
them
,
<EOS>
as
a
painter
would
who
should
dress
a
peasant
in
robe
of
state
or
give
the
nose
or
any
other
feature
of
a
Venus
to
a
satyr
.
<EOS>
what
have
the
destroyer
of
mankind
,
that
glorious
pair
,
one
of
whom
come
into
the
world
to
usurp
the
dominion
and
abolish
the
constitution
of
his
own
country
;
the
other
to
conquer
,
enslave
,
and
rule
over
the
whole
world
,
at
least
as
much
as
be
well
known
to
him
,
and
the
shortness
of
his
life
would
give
him
leave
to
visit
;
what
have
,
I
say
,
such
as
these
to
do
with
clemency
?
<EOS>
who
can
not
see
the
absurdity
and
contradiction
of
mix
such
an
ingredient
with
those
noble
and
great
quality
I
have
before
mention
?
<EOS>
now
,
in
Wild
everything
be
truly
great
,
almost
without
alloy
,
as
his
imperfection
(
for
surely
some
small
one
he
have
)
be
only
such
as
serve
to
denominate
him
a
human
creature
,
of
which
kind
none
ever
arrive
at
consummate
excellence
.
<EOS>
but
surely
his
whole
behaviour
to
his
friend
Heartfree
be
a
convincing
proof
that
the
true
iron
or
steel
greatness
of
his
heart
be
not
debase
by
any
soft
metal
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
while
greatness
consist
in
power
,
pride
,
insolence
,
and
do
mischief
to
mankind
 
to
speak
out
 
while
a
great
man
and
a
great
rogue
be
synonymous
term
,
so
long
shall
Wild
stand
unrivalled
on
the
pinnacle
of
GREATNESS
.
<EOS>
nor
must
we
omit
here
,
as
the
finishing
of
his
character
,
what
indeed
ought
to
be
remember
on
his
tomb
or
his
statue
,
the
conformity
above
mention
of
his
death
to
his
life
;
and
that
Jonathan
Wild
the
great
,
after
all
his
mighty
exploit
,
be
,
what
so
few
great
man
can
accomplish
 
hang
by
the
neck
till
he
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
bring
our
hero
to
his
conclusion
,
it
may
be
satisfactory
to
some
reader
(
for
many
,
I
doubt
not
,
carry
their
concern
no
farther
than
his
fate
)
to
know
what
become
of
Heartfree
.
<EOS>
We
shall
acquaint
them
,
therefore
,
that
his
suffering
be
now
at
an
end
;
that
the
good
magistrate
easily
prevail
for
his
pardon
,
nor
be
content
till
he
have
make
him
all
the
reparation
he
could
for
his
trouble
,
though
the
share
he
have
in
bring
these
upon
him
be
not
only
innocent
but
from
its
motive
laudable
.
<EOS>
He
procure
the
restoration
of
the
jewel
from
the
man-
of
-
war
at
her
return
to
England
,
and
,
above
all
,
omit
no
labour
to
restore
Heartfree
to
his
reputation
,
and
to
persuade
his
neighbour
,
acquaintance
,
and
customer
,
of
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
when
the
commission
of
bankruptcy
be
satisfied
,
Heartfree
have
a
considerable
sum
remain
;
for
the
diamond
present
to
his
wife
be
of
prodigious
value
,
and
infinitely
recompense
the
loss
of
those
jewel
which
Miss
Straddle
have
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
He
now
set
up
again
in
his
trade
:
compassion
for
his
unmerited
misfortune
bring
him
many
customer
among
those
who
have
any
regard
to
humanity
;
and
he
hath
,
by
industry
join
with
parsimony
,
amass
a
considerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
he
be
now
grow
old
in
the
pure
love
and
friendship
,
but
never
have
another
child
.
<EOS>
friendly
marry
his
eld
daughter
at
the
age
of
nineteen
,
and
become
his
partner
in
trade
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
young
,
she
never
would
listen
to
the
address
of
any
lover
,
not
even
of
a
young
nobleman
,
who
offer
to
take
her
with
two
thousand
pound
,
which
her
father
would
have
willingly
produce
,
and
indeed
do
his
utmost
to
persuade
her
to
the
match
;
but
she
refuse
absolutely
,
nor
would
give
any
other
reason
,
when
Heartfree
press
her
,
than
that
she
have
dedicate
her
day
to
his
service
,
and
be
resolve
no
other
duty
should
interfere
with
that
which
she
owe
the
good
of
father
,
nor
prevent
her
from
be
the
nurse
of
his
old
age
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Heartfree
,
his
wife
,
his
two
daughter
,
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
his
grandchild
,
of
which
he
hath
several
,
live
all
together
in
one
house
;
and
that
with
such
amity
and
affection
towards
each
other
,
that
they
be
in
the
neighbourhood
call
the
family
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
all
the
other
person
mention
in
this
history
in
the
light
of
greatness
,
they
have
all
the
fate
adapt
to
it
,
be
every
one
hang
by
the
neck
,
save
two
,
viz
.
,
Miss
Theodosia
Snap
,
who
be
transport
to
America
,
where
she
be
pretty
well
married
,
reform
,
and
make
a
good
wife
;
and
the
count
,
who
recover
of
the
wound
he
have
receive
from
the
hermit
and
make
his
escape
into
France
,
where
he
commit
a
robbery
,
be
take
,
and
break
on
the
wheel
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
whoever
consider
the
common
fate
of
great
man
must
allow
they
well
deserve
and
hardly
earn
that
applause
<EOS>
which
be
give
them
by
the
world
;
for
,
when
we
reflect
on
the
labour
and
pain
,
the
care
,
disquietude
,
and
danger
which
attend
their
road
to
greatness
,
we
may
say
with
the
divine
that
a
man
may
go
to
heaven
with
half
the
pain
which
it
cost
him
to
purchase
hell
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
the
world
have
this
reason
at
least
to
honour
such
character
as
that
of
Wild
:
that
,
while
it
be
in
the
power
of
every
man
to
be
perfectly
honest
,
not
one
in
a
thousand
be
capable
of
be
a
complete
rogue
;
and
few
indeed
there
be
who
,
if
they
be
inspire
with
the
vanity
of
imitate
our
hero
,
would
not
after
much
fruitless
pain
be
oblige
to
own
themselves
inferior
to
MR
.
