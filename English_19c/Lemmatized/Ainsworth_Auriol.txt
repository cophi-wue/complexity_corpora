<EOS>
such
be
the
vigil
of
the
year
1600
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
night
,
and
at
the
tenth
hour
,
a
man
of
striking
and
venerable
appearance
be
see
to
emerge
upon
a
small
wooden
balcony
,
project
from
a
bay
-
window
near
the
top
of
a
picturesque
structure
situate
at
the
southern
extremity
of
London
-
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
's
beard
and
hair
be
as
white
as
snow
--
<EOS>
the
former
descending
almost
to
his
girdle
<EOS>
;
so
be
the
thick
over
--
hanging
brow
that
shade
his
still
pierce
eye
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
be
high
,
bald
,
and
plough
by
innumerable
wrinkle
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
despite
its
death-
like
paleness
,
have
a
noble
and
majestic
cast
,
and
his
figure
,
though
wear
to
the
bone
by
a
life
of
the
severest
study
,
and
bent
by
the
weight
of
year
,
must
have
be
once
lofty
and
commanding
.
<EOS>
His
dress
consist
of
a
doublet
and
hose
of
sad
-
coloured
cloth
,
over
which
he
wear
a
loose
gown
of
black
silk
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
cover
by
a
square
black
cap
,
from
beneath
which
his
silver
lock
stray
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
know
by
the
name
of
Doctor
Lamb
,
and
addict
to
alchemical
and
philosophical
pursuit
,
this
venerable
personage
be
esteem
by
the
vulgar
as
little
well
than
a
wizard
.
<EOS>
strange
tale
be
report
and
believe
of
him
.
<EOS>
amongst
other
,
it
be
say
that
he
possess
a
familiar
,
because
he
chance
to
employ
a
deformed
,
crack
-
brained
dwarf
,
who
assist
him
in
his
operation
,
and
whom
he
appropriately
enough
denominate
Flapdragon
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
's
gaze
be
fix
intently
upon
the
heavens
,
and
he
seem
to
be
note
the
position
of
the
moon
with
reference
to
some
particular
star
.
 
<EOS>
after
remain
in
this
posture
for
a
few
minute
,
he
be
about
to
retire
,
when
a
loud
crash
arrest
him
,
and
he
turn
to
see
whence
it
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
before
him
stand
the
Southwark
Gateway
--
a
square
stone
building
,
with
a
round
,
embattle
turret
at
each
corner
,
and
a
flat
,
leaden
roof
,
plant
with
a
forest
of
pole
,
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
high
,
garnish
with
human
head
.
<EOS>
to
his
surprise
,
the
doctor
perceive
that
two
of
these
pole
have
just
be
overthrow
by
a
tall
man
,
who
be
in
the
act
of
strip
them
of
their
grisly
burden
.
 
<EOS>
have
accomplish
his
object
,
the
mysterious
plunderer
thrust
his
spoil
into
a
leathern
bag
with
which
he
be
provide
,
tie
its
mouth
,
and
be
about
to
take
his
departure
by
mean
of
a
rope
-
ladder
attach
to
the
battlement
,
when
his
retreat
be
suddenly
cut
off
by
the
gatekeeper
,
arm
with
a
halberd
,
and
bear
a
lantern
,
who
issue
from
a
door
opening
upon
the
lead
.
 
<EOS>
the
baffle
marauder
look
round
,
and
remark
the
open
window
at
which
Doctor
Lamb
be
station
,
hurl
the
sack
and
its
content
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
try
to
gain
the
ladder
,
but
be
intercept
by
the
gatekeeper
,
who
deal
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
with
his
halberd
.
<EOS>
the
plunderer
utter
a
loud
cry
,
and
attempt
to
draw
his
sword
;
but
before
he
could
do
so
,
he
receive
a
thrust
in
the
side
from
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
He
then
fall
,
and
the
gatekeeper
would
have
repeat
the
blow
,
if
the
doctor
have
not
call
to
him
to
desist
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
kill
him
,
good
Baldred
,
"
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
the
attempt
may
not
be
so
criminal
as
it
appear
.
<EOS>
doubtless
,
the
mutilated
remain
which
the
poor
wretch
have
attempt
to
carry
off
,
be
those
of
his
kindre
,
and
horror
at
their
exposure
must
have
lead
him
to
commit
the
offence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
doctor
,
"
reply
Baldred
;
"
and
if
so
I
shall
be
sorry
I
have
hurt
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
responsible
for
the
safe
custody
of
these
traitorous
relic
,
and
it
be
as
much
as
my
own
head
be
worth
to
permit
their
removal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
reply
Doctor
Lamb
;
"
and
you
be
fully
justify
in
what
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
It
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
,
to
know
whose
miserable
remain
have
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
the
head
of
two
rank
,
papist
,
"
reply
Baldred
,
"
who
be
decapitate
on
Tower
Hill

on
Saint
Nicholas

ago

<EOS>
"
but

demand
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
how

"
 
<EOS>
"
They

"
reply
Baldred;--"Sir

<EOS>
perchance
they
be
know
to
your
worship
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
too
well
--
too
well
!
"
reply
Doctor
Lamb
,
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
that
startle
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
near
kinsmen
mine
own
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
like
who
have
make
this
strange
attempt
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
a
verity
,
a
fair
youth
,
"
reply
Baldred
,
hold
down
the
lantern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
I
have
not
wound
him
to
the
death
!
<EOS>
no
,
his
heart
still
beat
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
here
be
his
tablet
,
"
he
add
,
take
a
small
book
from
his
doublet
;
"
these
may
give
the
information
you
seek
.
<EOS>
You
be
right
in
your
conjecture
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
the
name
herein
inscribed
be
the
same
as
that
borne
by
the
other
--
Auriol
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
all
,
"
cry
Lamb
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pious
and
praiseworthy
deed
.
<EOS>
bring
the
unfortunate
youth
to
my
dwelling
,
Baldred
,
and
you
shall
be
well
reward
.
<EOS>
use
despatch
,
I
pray
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
gatekeeper
essay
to
comply
,
the
wounded
man
groan
deeply
,
as
if
in
great
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
ring
me
the
weapon
with
which
you
smote
him
,
"
cry
Doctor
Lamb
,
in
accent
of
commiseration
,
"
and
I
will
anoint
it
with
the
powder
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
His
anguish
will
be
speedily
abate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
worship
can
accomplish
wonder
,
"
cry
Baldred
,
throw
the
halberd
into
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
part
as
gently
as
I
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
alchemist
take
up
the
weapon
,
and
disappear
through
the
window
,
the
gatekeeper
lift
the
wounded
man
by
the
shoulder
,
and
convey
him
down
a
narrow
winding
staircase
to
a
low
chamber
.
<EOS>
though
he
proceed
carefully
,
the
sufferer
be
put
to
excruciating
pain
;
and
when
Baldred
place
him
on
a
wooden
bench
,
and
hold
a
lamp
towards
him
,
he
perceive
that
his
feature
be
darken
and
distort
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
it
be
all
over
with
him
,
"
murmur
the
gatekeeper
;
"
I
shall
have
a
dead
body
to
take
to
Doctor
Lamb
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
charity
to
knock
him
on
the
head
,
rather
than
let
him
suffer
thus
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
pass
for
a
cunning
man
,
but
if
he
can
cure
this
poor
youth
without
see
him
,
by
the
help
of
his
sympathetic
ointment
,
I
shall
begin
to
believe
,
what
some
folk
avouch
,
that
he
have
relation
with
the
devil
.
"
 
<EOS>
while
Baldred
be
ruminate
in
this
manner
,
a
sudden
and
extraordinary
change
take
place
in
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
as
if
by
magic
,
the
contraction
of
the
muscle
subside
;
the
feature
assume
a
wholesome
hue
,
and
the
respiration
be
no
longer
laborious
.
<EOS>
Baldred
stare
as
if
a
miracle
have
be
work
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
the
countenance
of
the
youth
have
regain
its
original
expression
,
the
gatekeeper
could
not
help
be
strike
by
its
extreme
beauty
.
<EOS>
the
face
be
a
perfect
oval
,
with
regular
and
delicate
feature
.
<EOS>
a
short
silken
moustache
cover
the
upper
lip
,
which
be
short
and
proud
,
and
a
pointed
beard
terminate
the
chin
.
<EOS>
the
hair
be
black
,
glossy
,
and
cut
short
,
so
as
to
disclose
a
highly
intellectual
expanse
of
brow
.
 
<EOS>
the
youth
's
figure
be
slight
,
but
admirably
proportion
His
attire
consist
of
a
black
satin
doublet
,
slash
with
white
,
hose
of
black
silk
,
and
a
short
velvet
mantle
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
still
closed
,
and
it
be
difficult
to
say
what
effect
they
may
give
to
the
face
when
they
light
it
up
;
but
notwithstanding
its
beauty
,
it
be
impossible
not
to
admit
that
a
strange
,
sinister
,
and
almost
demoniacal
expression
pervade
the
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
and
with
as
much
suddenness
as
his
cure
have
be
effect
,
the
young
man
start
,
utter
a
piercing
cry
,
and
place
his
hand
to
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Caitiff
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
fix
his
blaze
eye
on
the
gatekeeper
,
"
why
do
you
torture
me
thus
?
<EOS>
finish
me
at
once
--
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
overcome
by
anguish
,
he
sink
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
touch
you
,
sir
,
"
reply
Baldred
.
<EOS>
"
I
bring
you
here
to
succour
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
easy

at

His

fall
upon

and
obliterate

I
do
so

the

it
to
work

forth

this

through

of
its
squalid

and
wretched

ruffianly
occupant

<EOS>
who

strike
with
amazement

that
such
a
huge
receptacle
of
vice
and
crime
should
be
allow
to
exist
in
the
very
heart
of
the
metropolis
,
like
an
ulcerated
spot

capable

taint
the
whole
system

<EOS>
of

the

but
whether
any

<EOS>
for

<EOS>
there
be
something
savagely
picturesque
in
the
aspect
of
the

but
its
feature
be
too
loathsome
to
be
regard
with
any
other
feeling
than
disgust
.
<EOS>
the
house
look
as
sordid
,
and
as
thickly
crust
with
the
leprosy

,
as
their

<EOS>
horrible
habitation
they

in

<EOS>
many

where

the

some
even
want
door

and
no

make
to
conceal
the
squalor
within
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
seem
to
be
intrude
on

.
<EOS>
miserable

almost
destitute

of

the

<EOS>

it

but
where
a
solitary
straggler

his
sinister
look

<EOS>
mean

in
perfect
keeping

so

wretched

that

<EOS>
as

It

every

<EOS>
It
be
a
positive
relief
to

to
the

<EOS>
His
hand

foot
be
equally
disproportione

His

be
crookene

to
detect
in

the

I

with

until
at

we
be
both
bring
to
the
verge
of
the
grave
in

search
after

<EOS>
one
night
--
I
remember
it
<EOS>
well,--it
be
the
last
night
of
the
sixteenth
century,--a
young
man
,
severely
wound
,
be
bring
to
my
master
's
dwelling
on
London
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
I
help
to
convey
him
to
the
laboratory

where
I
leave
him
with
the
doctor

who
be
busy
with
his
experiment

<EOS>
My
curiosity
be
arouse
,
I
listen
at
the
door
,
and
though
I
could
not
distinguish
much
that
pass
inside
,
I
hear
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
Doctor
Lamb
have
make
the
grand
discovery
,
and
succeed
in
distil
the
elixir
.
<EOS>
have
learn
this
,
I
go
down
stair
,
wonder
what
would
next
ensue
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
elapse
,
and
while
the
bell
be
ring
in
the
new
year
joyfully
,
the
young
man
whom
I
have
assist
to
carry
upstairs
,
and
whom
I
suppose
at
death
's
door
,
march
down
as
firmly
as
if
nothing
have
happen
,
pass
by
me
,
and
disappear
,
before
I
could
shake
off
my
astonishment
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
once
he
have
drunk
the
elixir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah!--ah
!
"
exclaim
the
Tinker
,
with
a
know
glance
at
his
companion
,
who
return
it
with
gesture
of
equal
significance
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
"
pursue
the
dwarf
,
"
<EOS>
I
fly
to
the
laboratory
,
and
there
,
extend
on
the
floor
,
I
find
the
dead
body
of
Dr.
Lamb
.
<EOS>
I
debate
with
myself
what
to
do
--
whether
to
pursue
his
murderer
,
for
such
I
account
the
young
man
;
but
,
on
reflection
,
I
think
the
course
useless
.
<EOS>
I
next
look
round
to
see
whether
the
precious
elixir
be
go
.
<EOS>
on
the
table
stand
a
phial
,
from
which
a
strong
spirituous
odour
exhale
;
but
it
be
empty
.
<EOS>
I
then
turn
my
attention
to
a
receiver
,
connect
by
a
worm
with
an
alembic
on
the
furnace
.
<EOS>
on
examine
it
,
I
find
it
contain
a
small
quantity
of
a
bright
transparent
liquid
,
which
,
pour
forth
into
a
glass
,
emit
precisely
the
same
odour
as
the
phial
.
<EOS>
persuade
this
must
be
the
draught
of
immortality
,
I
raise
it
to
my
lip
;
but
apprehension
lest
it
may
be
poison
stay
my
hand
.
<EOS>
reassure
,
however
,
by
the
thought
of
the
young
man
's
miraculous
recovery
,
I
quaff
the
potion
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
I
have
swallow
fire
,
and
at
first
I
think
all
be
over
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
shriek
out
;
but
there
be
no
one
to
heed
my
cry
,
unless
it
be
my
dead
master
,
and
two
or
three
skeleton
with
which
the
wall
be
garnish
.
<EOS>
and
these
,
in
truth
,
do
seem
to
hear
me
;
for
the
dead
corpse
open
its
glassy
orb
,
and
eye
me
reproachfully
;
the
skeleton
shake
their
fleshless
arm
and
gibber
;
and
the
various
strange
object
with
which
the
chamber
be
fill
,
seem
to
deride
and
menace
me
.
<EOS>
the
terror
occasion
by
these
fantasy
,
combine
with
the
potency
of
the
draught
,
take
away
my
sense
.
<EOS>
when
I
recover
,
I
find
all
tranquil
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Lamb
be
lie
stark
and
stiff
at
my
foot
,
with
an
expression
of
reproach
on
his
fix
countenance
;
and
the
skeleton
be
hang
quietly
in
their
place
.
<EOS>
convinced
that
I
be
proof
against
death
,
I
go
forth
.
<EOS>
but
a
curse
go
with
me
!
<EOS>
from
that
day
to
this
,
I
have
live

it
have
be
in
such
poverty

distress

that
I

better
far

besides

I

constantly
haunt
by
vision

It

and

Her

<EOS>
Her
feature

almost
angelic
in
expression
,
with
an
outline
of
the

and
be

a
brow
smooth
than

<EOS>
Her

<EOS>
Ebba

for
a
moment
at
the

to
breathe
the
barmy
air
.
<EOS>
as
she
inhale

reverie
to

a
tall

,
wrap

,
who
regard
her
with
the
most
fix
attention

<EOS>
Ebba

,
for
the
first
time

remark
him
,
and
be
startle
by
his
strange
,
sinister
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
handsome
,
but
so
malignant
and
fierce
in
expression
,
that
they
inspire
only
aversion
.
<EOS>
a
sardonic
grin

his
thin
lip
,
and
his
short
,
crisply
curl
hair
,
raven
black
in
hue
,
contrast
forcibly
and
disagreeably
with
his
cadaverous
complexion
.
<EOS>
an
attraction
like
that
of
the
snake
seem
to
reside
in
his
dark
blaze
eye
,
for
Ebba
tremble
like
a
bird
beneath
their
influence
,
and
could
not
remove
her
gaze
from

<EOS>
a

presentiment
of
come
ill
smote
her
,
and
she
dread
lest
the
mysterious
being
before
her
may
be
connect
in
some
inexplicable
way

<EOS>
on

Ebba
stop
,
and
the
bloom
suddenly
forsook
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
but
Auriol
seem
unable
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
neither
dare
to
regard
the

<EOS>
fortunately
the
silence
be
break
by
the
clinking
of
the
smith

hammer
upon

<EOS>
"
if

and
,
catch
a
glimpse

"
I

Ebba

again

<EOS>
but
since
you
be
about

I
must
confess
I

You

this
I

of
excite
a
passion

must
destroy
you

<EOS>
I
will
ask
you
to
hate
me
--
to
regard
me
as
a
monster
whom
you

rather
than
as
a
being
for
whom
you
should
entertain
the
slight
sympathy

V.
the
meeting
NEAR

STATUE
 
<EOS>
the
evening
of
the
third
day
arrive
,
and
Auriol
enter
Hyde
Park
by
Stanhope
-
gate
.
<EOS>
glance
at
his
watch
,
and
find
it
want
nearly
three
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
time
appoint
for
his
meeting
with
the
mysterious
stranger
,
he
strike
across
the
Park
,
in
the
direction
of
the
Serpentine
River
.
<EOS>
apparently
he
be
now
perfectly
recover
,
for
his
arm
be
without
the
support
of
the
sling
,
and
he
walk
with
great
swiftness
.
<EOS>
but
his
countenance
be
deathly
pale
,
and
his
look
be
so
wild
and
disorder
,
that
the
few
person
he
encounter
shrink
from
him
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
minute
'
rapid
walking
bring
him
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
Serpentine
,
and
advance
close
to
the
edge
of
the
embankment
,
he
gaze
at
the
water
beneath
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
plunge
into
them
,
if
I
could
find
repose
,
"
he
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
would
avail
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
should
only
add
to
my
suffering
.
<EOS>
no
;
I
must
continue
to
endure
the
weight
of
a
life
burn
by
crime
and
remorse
,
till
I
can
find
out
the
mean
of
free
myself
from
it
.
<EOS>
once
I
dread
this
unknown
danger
,
but
now
I
seek
for
it
in
vain
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
current
of
his
thought
be
here
interrupt
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
dark
object
on
the
surface
of
the
water
,
which
he
at
first
take
to
he
a
huge
fish
,
with
a
pair
of
green
fin
spring
from
its
back
;
but
after
watch
it
more
closely
for
a
few
moment
,
he
become
convinced
that
it
be
a
human
being
,
trick
out
in
some
masquerade
attire
,
while
the
slight
struggle
which
it
make
proved
that
life
be
not
entirely
extinct
.
 
<EOS>
though
,
the
moment
before
,
he
have
contemplate
self
-
destruction
,
and
have
only
be
restrain
from
the
attempt
by
the
certainty
of
fail
in
his
purpose
,
instinct
prompt
him
to
rescue
the
perish
creature
before
him
.
<EOS>
without
hesitation
,
therefore
,
and
without
tarry
to
div
himself
of
his
clothe
,
he
dash
into
the
water
,
and
strike
out
,
instantly
reach
the
object
of
his
quest
,
which
still
continue
to
float
,
and
turn
it
over
,
for
the
face
<EOS>
be
downwards
<EOS>
,
he
perceive
it
be
an
old
man
,
of
exceedingly
small
size
,
habit
in
a
pantomimic
garb
.
<EOS>
He
also
remark
that
a
rope
be
twist
round
the
neck
of
the
unfortunate
being
,
make
it
evident
that
some
violent
attempt
have
be
make
upon
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
without
pause
for
further
investigation
,
he
take
firm
hold
of
the
leathern
wing
of
the
dwarf
,
and
with
his
disengaged
hand
propel
himself
towards
the
shore
,
drag
the
other
after
him
.
<EOS>
the
next
instant
he
reach
the
bank
,
clamber
up
the
low
brickwork
,
and
place
his
burden
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
of
the
plunge
have
attract
attention
,
and
several
person
now
hurry
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
on
come
up
,
and
find
Auriol
bend
over
a
water
-
sprite
--
for
such
,
at
first
sight
,
the
dwarf
appear
--
they
could
not
repress
their
astonishment
.
<EOS>
wholly
insensible
to
the
presence
of
those
around
him
,
Auriol
endeavour
to
recall
where
he
have
see
the
dwarf
before
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
the
recollection
flash
upon
him
,
and
he
cry
aloud
,
"
why
,
it
be
my
poor
murder
grandfather
's
attendant
,
Flapdragon
!
<EOS>
but
no
no!--he
must
be
dead
age
ago
!
<EOS>
yet
the
resemblance
be
singularly
strike
!
"
 
<EOS>
Auriol
's
exclamation
,
couple
with
his
wild
demeanour
,
surprise
the
bystander
,
and
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
be
a
travel
showman
,
who
have
attempt
to
drown
his
dwarf
--
the
grotesque
,
impish
garb
of
the
latter
convince
them
that
he
have
be
exhibit
at
a
booth
.
<EOS>
They
make
sign
,
therefore
,
to
each
other
not
to
let
Auriol
escape
,
and
one
of
them
,
raise
the
dwarf
's
head
on
his
knee
,
produce
a
flask
,
and
pour
some
brandy
from
it
down
his
throat
,
while
other
chafe
his
hand
these
effort
be
attend
with
much
speedy
success
than
may
have
be
anticipate
.
<EOS>
after
a
struggle
or
two
for
respiration
the
dwarf
open
his
eye
,
and
gaze
at
the
group
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
Flapdragon
!
"
exclaim
Auriol
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
cry
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
rejoin
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
recollect
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
dwarf
,
gaze
at
him
fixedly
;
"

are--
"
<EOS>
and
he
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

evasively

<EOS>
"
I

like
a

"
 
<EOS>
at
this
speech
there

a
titter
of

<EOS>
"
You
may
laugh
,
but

be
true
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
dwarf

angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
speak
of
this
anon

"
say
Auriol
.
<EOS>
"
Will

place
money
in
the
hand
of

take
up

Auriol

from
which

recoil
at

and
beheld
the
stranger
lean
over

<EOS>
on
the
night
of
the
1st
of
March
,
1800
,
and
at
a
late
hour
,
a
man
,
wrap
in
a
large
horseman
's
cloak
,
and
of
strange
and
sinister
appearance
,
enter
an
old
deserted
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
stepney
-
green
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
,
carry
himself
very
erect
,
and
seem
in
the
full
vigour
of
early
manhood
;
but
his
feature
have
a
worn
and
ghastly
look
,
as
if
bear
the
stamp
of
long
-
indulged
and
frightful
excess
,
while
his
dark
gleaming
eye
give
him
an
expression
almost
diabolical
.
 
<EOS>
this
person
have
gain
the
house
from
a
garden
behind
it
,
and
now
stand
in
a
large
dismantle

from
which

broad
oaken
staircase

with
curiously

,
lead
to
a
gallery
,
and
hence
to
the
upper
chamber
of
the
habitation
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
dreary
than
the
aspect
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
richly
mould
ceiling
be
festoon
with
spider
'
webs
,
and
in
some
place
have
fall
in
heap
upon
the
floor
;
the
glory
of
the
tapestry
upon
the
wall
be
obliterate
by
damp
;
the
square
and
black
and
white
marble
,
with
which
the
hall
be
pave
,
be
loosen
,
and
quake
beneath
the
footstep
;
the
wide
and
empty
fireplace
yawn
like
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
;
the
bolt
of
the
close
window
be
rust
in
their
socket
;
and
the
heap
of
dust
before
the
outer
door
prove
that
long
year
have
elapse
since
any
one
have
pass
through
it

take
a
dark
lantern
from
beneath
his
cloak

the
individual

question
gaze
for
a
moment
around
him
,
and
then
,
with
a
sardonic
smile
playing
upon
his
feature
,
direct
his
step
towards
a
room
on
the
right
,

door
of
which
stand
open

<EOS>
this
chamber
,
which
be
large
and
case
with
oak
,
be
wholly
unfurnished
,
like
the
hall
,
and
in
an
equally
dilapidated
condition
.
<EOS>
the
only
decoration
remain
on
its
wall
be
the
portrait
of
a
venerable
personage
in
the
cap
and
gown
of
Henry

against
a
panel
--
a
circumstance
which

and
beneath
it

but
of
a
severe
and
philosophic
cast

<EOS>
in
the
eye
alone
could
be
discern
the
peculiar
and
terrible
glimmer
which
distinguish
his
own
glance
.
<EOS>
after

some
time
fixedly

<EOS>
I
know
that
thou
wert
a
brother
of

one
of

and
didst
penetrate
the
mystery

I
know
also

that
thou

last
night

bade
me
come
hither

and
I
should
find
what
I

<EOS>
the
condition
he
propose
be
,
that
I
should
either
give
him
my
own
soul

or
win

that

Auriol

<EOS>
I
assent

after
a
pause

he
strike

with
his
clenched

exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
:

of
a
little
recess

about
two
foot

<EOS>
utter
a
joyful
cry

ring

and
draw
the
stone
forward
without

but
Rougemont
's
astonishment
at
this
marvel
quickly
give
way
to
other

<EOS>
It
may
be
the
reverberation
of

vaulted
roof

but
a
deep
groan
seem
to
reproach
the
young

for
his
sacrilege

<EOS>
undeterred

by

His

more

hundred
thousand

the
sight

desperation

to
his

and
empty

dreamy
elysium
,

with
Edith

in
a
lovely
garden
,
redolent
of

and

Their

start
back
,
point
to
a
large
black
snake

before

and
upon
which
she
would
have

<EOS>
Auriol

the
reptile
with
his
heel
;
but
,
avoid
the
blow
,

coil
around
his
leg
,
and
plunge

into

and
most
luxuriantly
furnished
chamber
,
he
be
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
he

there
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
he
could
fully
recall
the
mysterious
event
of
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
as
have
be
foretold
,
however
,
by

<EOS>
His

and
express
his
regret
that
he
have
misinform

in
state
that
Miss

<EOS>
both
she
and
Mr.
Talbot
,
he
say
,
have
go
out
about
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
Auriol
look
incredulous
,
but
,
without

any
remark
,
depart
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
home
,
he
write
a
few
line
to
Mr.

,
announce
the
sudden
and
extraordinary
change
in
his
fortune
,
and
formally

<EOS>
He
be
about

<EOS>
It

by
this
proof
of
her

Auriol
half
devour
the
note
with
kiss
,
and
instantly
send
off
his
own
letter
to
her
father
--
merely
add
a
few
word
to
say
that
he
would
call
for
an
answer
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
to
wait
thus
long
for
a
reply
.
<EOS>
Ere
an
hour
have
elapse
,
Mr.

bring
it
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.

a
man
of
about
sixty
--
tall
,
thin
,
and
gentlemanlike
in
deportment
,
with
grey
hair
,
and
black
eyebrow
,
which
lend
considerable
expression
to
the
orb
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
a
bilious
brown
,
and
he
possess
none
of
the
good
look
which
in
his
daughter

so

Auriol
,
and
which

man
of
the
world

though
not

unamiable
person
,
Mr.
Talbot

by
selfish
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
have
hitherto
look
with
an
unfavourable
eye
upon
Auriol
's
attention
to
his
daughter
,
from
a
notion
that
the
connection
would
be
very
undesirable
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
;
but
the
magnificence
of
the
house
in
Saint

square
,
which
fully
bear
out
Auriol
's
account
of
his
newly
acquire
wealth
,
work
a
complete
change
in
his
opinion
,
and

to
understand
that
he
should
be
delighted
to
have
him
for
a
son
-
in

so
favourably
disposed

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
but

"

<EOS>
"
scarcely

<EOS>
the
coincidence

appointment
and
the
time

Rougemont
for
the
delivery
of
his
victim

strike
Auriol
forcibly
.
<EOS>
His
emotion
however
,
escape
Mr.

who
soon
after
depart

have
engage
his

at
seven
o'clock

<EOS>
Auriol
it
need
scarcely
be
say
,
be
punctual
to
the
hour
,
or
,
rather
,
he
anticipate

.
<EOS>
He
find
Edith

almost
oriental

<EOS>
Her

softness
and
her
tooth
like

<EOS>
perfect
grace
accompany
all
her
movement

and
one
only
wonder
that
foot
so
small
as
those
she
possess
should
have
the
power
of
sustain
a
form
which
,
though
lightsome
,

yet
round
in
its
proportion

"

I

he

and
my
apprehension
have

such
a
point

during

and
all
continue

they
move
on

"
before

<EOS>
Ye

"
 
<EOS>
but
without
pay
any
attention
to
the
inquiry
,
Reeks
quit
the
room
,
and
close
the
door
carefully
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
next
cross
the
hall
,
and
cautiously
ascend
a
staircase
at
the
farther
end
of
it

reach
the
landing

place
.
<EOS>
beyond

be
a
gallery
,
from
which
several
chamber
open

<EOS>
advance
a
few
pace
,
he
listen
intently
,
and
hear
a
slight
sound
in
an
apartment
to
the
right
,
he
step
softly
towards
it
,
and
place
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
,
beheld
a
tall
man
,
dress
in
black
pacing
to
and
fro
with
rapid
stride
,
while
three
other

,
wrap
in
sable
gown

and
disguise
with
hideous
mask

stand
silent
and
motionless
at
a
little
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
tall
man
he
recognise
Cyprian
Rougemont
.
<EOS>
upon
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
be
lay
a
large
open
volume
,
bind
in
black
vellum
.
<EOS>
near
it
stand
a
lamp
,
which
serve
to
illumine
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
Rougemont
stop
,
and
turn
over
several
leave
of
the
book
,
which
be
cover
with
cabalistic
character
,
appear
in
search
of
some
magic
formula

<EOS>
before
he

a
startling
interruption
occur

<EOS>
an
alarum

fix
against

begin
to
ring
,
and
at
the

moment
the
door
of
a
cabinet
fly
open
,
and
a
large
ape
(
for
such
it
seem
to
Reeks
)
,
clothe
in
a
woollen
shirt
and
drawer
,
spring
forth
,
and
bound
upon
the
table
beside
Rougemont
,
place
its
mouth
to
his
ear
.
<EOS>
the
communication
thus
strangely
make
seem
highly
displeasing
to
Rougemont
,
who
knit
his
brow
,
and
deliver
some
instruction
in
an
under
tone
to
the
monkey
.
<EOS>
the
animal
nod
its
head
in
token
of
obedience

<EOS>
Rougemont
next
take
up
the
lamp

with
the
evident
intention
of
quit

room
,
see
which
,
Reeks
hastily
retreat
to
an
adjoining
chamber
,
the
door
of
which
be
fortunately
open

and
have
scarcely
gain
its
shelter
when
the
four
mysterious
personage
appear
on

gallery

<EOS>
Reeks
hear
their
footstep
descend
the
staircase
,
and
then
,
creep
cautiously
after
them
,
watch
them
across
the
hall
,
and
pause
before
the
chamber
contain
Mr.
Thorneycroft
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
deliberation
,
Rougemont
noiselessly
lock
the
door
,
take
out
the
key
,
and
leave
two
of
his
attendant
on
guard
,
return
with
the
third
towards
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
without
tarry
to
confront
them
,
Reeks
start
back
,
and
hurry
along
the
gallery
till
he
come
to
a
back
staircase

It

It

Thorneycroft

<EOS>
"
such
reprehensible
indifference

<EOS>
"
I

"
Halloa

wot

cry
the
Tinker
;
"
I
think
I
heerd
a
noise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
do
I
,
"
rejoin
the
Sandman
;
"
<EOS>
a
strange
sort
o
'
rumblin
'
sound
overhead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
it
go
again
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Ginger
;
"
wot
an
awful
din
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
now
it
be
underneath
,
"
say
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
turn
pale
,
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
sound
as
if
some
hide
machinery
be
at
work
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
noise
,
which
up
to
this
moment
have
bear
an
indistinct
resemblance
to
the
creaking
of
wheel
and
pulley
,
now
increase
to
a
violent
clatter
,
while
the
house
be
shake
as
if
by
the
explosion
of
a
mine
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
the
occupant
of
the
chair
receive
a
sharp
electrical
shock
,
that
agitate
every
limb
,
and
cause
Mr.
Thorneycroft
to
let
fall
his
pistol
,
which
go
off
as
it
reach
the
ground
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
the
Sandman
drop
his
goblet
,
and
the
Tinker
relinquish
his
grasp
of
the
cutlass
.
<EOS>
before
they
could
recover
from
the
shock
,
all
three
be
catch
by
stout
wooden
hook
,
which
,
detach
themselves
from
the
back
of
the
chair
,
pinion
their
arm
,
while
their
leg
be
restrain
by
fetter
,
which
spring
from
the
ground
and
clasp
round
their
ankle
.
<EOS>
thus
fix
,
they
struggle
vainly
to
get
free
.
<EOS>
the
chair
seem
nail
to
the
ground
,
so
that
all
effort
to
move
them
prove
futile
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
bad
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
from
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
already
allude
to
,
descend
three
heavy
bell
-
shape
helmet
,
fashion
like
those
wear
by
diver
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
and
have
round
eyelet
-
hole
of
glass
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
from
the
manner
of
their
descent
,
that
these
helmet
must
drop
on
the
head
of
the
sitter
--
a
conviction
that
fill
them
with
inexpressible
terror
.
<EOS>
They
shout
,
and
swear
frightfully
;
but
their
vociferation
avail
them
nothing
.
<EOS>
down
come
the
helmet
,
and
the
same
moment
the
monkey
which
have
be
see
by
Reeks
issue
from
a
cupboard
at
the
top
of
a
cabinet
,
and
grin
and
gibber
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
Down
come
the
first
helmet
,
and
cover
the
Tinker
to
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
be
at
once
ludicrous
and
terrible
,
and
his
roaring
within
the
casque
sound
like
the
bellowing
of
a
bait
bull
.
 
<EOS>
Down
come
the
second
helmet
,
though
rather
more
slowly
,
and
the
Sandman
be
eclipse
in
the
same
manner
as
the
Tinker
,
and
roar
as
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
in
both
these
instance
the
helmet
have
drop
without
guidance
,
but
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
a
hand
,
thrust
out
of
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
,
hold
the
helmet
suspend
over
his
head
,
like
the
sword
of
Damocles
.
<EOS>
while
the
poor
iron
-
merchant
momentarily
expect
the
same
doom
as
his
companion
,
his
attention
be
attract
towards
the
monkey
,
which
,
cling
with
one
hand
to
the
side
of
the
cabinet
,
extend
the
other
skinny
arm
towards
him
,
and
exclaimed--"Will
you
swear
to
go
hence
if
you
be
spare
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
will
not
,
"
reply
the
iron
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
speak
,
when
the
helmet
fall
with
a
jerk
,
and
extinguish
him
like
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Ginger
alone
remain
.
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
this
strange
scene
,
he
have
stand
with
the
bottle
in
hand
,
transfix
with
terror
and
astonishment
,
and
wholly
unable
to
move
or
cry
out
.
<EOS>
a
climax
be
put
to
his
fright
,
by
the
descent
of
the
three
chair
,
with
their
occupant
,
through
the
floor
into
a
vault
beneath
;
and
as
the
helmet
be
whisk
up
again
to
the
ceiling
,
and
the
trap
-
door
close
upon
the
chair
,
he
drop
the
bottle
,
and
fall
with
his
face
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
soon
rouse
by
a
pull
at
his
hair
,
while
a
shrill
voice
call
him
by
his
name

<EOS>
"

groan
the

"

the
speaker

Ginger

pointed
arch

stream
of
light
,
descend
from
a
narrow
aperture
in
the
roof
,
fall
upon
his
waste
and
haggard
feature
.
<EOS>
His
dark
brown
hair
hang
about
his
face
in
elf
-
lock
,
his
beard
be
untrimmed

and
a
fixed
and
stony
glare

rivet
his
attention

vainly
seek
some
explanation
of
this
name
in

after
content

rest
for
the
first
time
on

on
behold
them
he
start

hold
out
his
arm
to
examine
the
sleeve
more
narrowly

satisfied
that
he
be
not

and
troubled

forth

They
bear

be
another
pause

during
which
the

indulge
in
a
suppressed
fit
of
laughter

Would
I
could
look
forth
from

dungeon

Auriol

again

silence
,

and
satisfy
myself
of
the
truth

falsehood
of
my
doubt
by
a
view
of

I
be
so
perplexed
in

that
if
I
be
not
distract
already

they
would
be
enough
to
drive
me
so

dismal

terrible

possess
me

upon

still

the
compact

that
I
could
shake
off
the
conviction

whether
my

similar

You

when

disappear
for
a

and
then
return
with

torch

place
it
on

ground

hand
it
to
the

without

's
hesitation

"
It

me
rather
a
stimulant

remark
,
after
empty
the
phial

You

like
one
in

dream

Auriol
follow
his
conductor
down
the
flight
of
step
lead
from
the
dungeon
,
and
along
a
narrow
passage
.
<EOS>
as
he
proceed
,
he
think

hear
stealthy
footstep
behind
him
;
but
he
never
turn
his
head

to
see
whether

<EOS>
in
this
way
they
reach
a
short
steep
staircase
,
and
,
mount
it
,
enter
a
vault
,
in
which
Rougemont
pause
,
and
place
the
torch
he
have
bring
with
him
upon
the
floor

<EOS>
Its
lurid
glimmer
partially
illumine
the
chamber

of
stone

<EOS>
He

a
jerkin
of
grey
serge

fashioned
like
the
garment

by
the
common
people
in
Elizabeth

reign

and
wear
a
trencher
cap
on
his
head

<EOS>
Auriol
watch
him
as
he
timidly
advance
towards
Rougemont
,
and
have
an
indistinct
recollection
of
have
see
him
before

but
could
not
call
to
mind
how
or
where
.
 
<EOS>
"
be

commiseratingly
at
Auriol

My
master
often
make
inquiry
after

in

moment
to
contemplate

Ebba
express

<EOS>
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber

Yon

in
1633
,
be

<EOS>
well
,
my

how
to

He

me

we

the
cream
of

jest
be
to
come

<EOS>
He

give

night
of

seizure
by
the
mysterious
stranger
.
<EOS>
though
almost
deprive
of
consciousness
by
terror
,
the

could

movement
of

a
gloomy
chamber
of
vast
extent
,
while
beside
her
,
and

her
from
fall
,
stand
the
mysterious
and
terrible
stranger
.
<EOS>
He

a
large
goblet

with
some
potent
liquid
to
her
lip
,
and

a
portion
of
it
.

her
,
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
produce
a
strange
excitement
,
against
which
she
struggle
with
all
her
power
.
<EOS>
Her
persecutor

hold
the
goblet
towards
her
,
while
a
sardonic
smile
play
upon
his
feature
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
seat

<EOS>
slowly
and
noiselessly
advance
,
they
halt
within
a
few
pace
of
her

<EOS>
"

and

"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
agonized
girl

<EOS>
at
this
moment
a

voice
from
behind
the
curtain
exclaimed---
 
"

"
 
<EOS>
"

distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"

voice
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
word
be

,
a
side
door

opposite
side
,
and
Auriol
be
drag
forth
from

by
two
masked
personage

who
look
like
familiar

Inquisition
.
 
<EOS>
"

demand
of
this
fiend
,
Ebba
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Auriol
,
gaze
at
her
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will

save
him
before
he
be
cast
,
living
,
into
the
tomb
?
"
cry
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
and
at
the
word
,
a
heavy
slab
or
marble
rise
slowly
from
the
floor
near
where
Ebba
sit
,
and
disclose
a
dark
pit
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
Ebba
gaze
into
the
abyss
with
indescribable
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
he
will
be
immure
,
unless
you

,
"
cry
the
voice
;
"
and
,
as
he
be
immortal
,
he
will
endure
an
eternity
of
torture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
save
him
so
,
but
I
may
precede
him
,
"
cry
Ebba
.
<EOS>
and
throw
her
hand
aloft
,
she
fling
herself
into
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
a
fearful
cry
resound
through
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
break
from
Auriol
,
who
vainly
strove
to
burst
from
those
who
hold
him
,
and
precipitate
himself
after
Ebba
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
and
while
Auriol
be
gaze
into
the
abyss
,
a
tongue
of
blue
flame
arise
from
it
,
dance
for
a
moment
in
the
air
,
and
then
vanish
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
it
go
than
a
figure
,
shroud
in
black
habiliment
,
and
hood
and
muffle
up
like
the
three
other
female
form
,
slowly
ascend
from
the
vault
,
apparently
without
support
,
and
remain
motionless
at
its
brink
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebba
!
"
exclaim
Auriol
,
in
a
voice
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
figure
bow
its
head
,
but
speak
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sign

"
thunder
the
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Your
attempt
at
self
-
destruction
have
place
you
wholly
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
sign
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
injunction
,
the
figure
move
slowly
towards
the
table
,
and
,
to
his
unspeakable
horror
,
Auriol
beheld
it
take
up
the
pen
and
write
upon
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
He
bend
forward
,
and
see
that
the
name
inscribed
thereon
be
EBBA
THORNEYCROFT
.
 
<EOS>
the
groan
to
which
he
give
utterance
be
echo
by
a
roar
of
diabolical
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
then
move
slowly
away
,
and
range
itself
with
the
other
veiled
form
.
 
<EOS>
"
all

accomplish
,
"
cry
the
voice
.
"
<EOS>
away
with
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
on
this
,
a
terrible
clangour

;
the
light
be
extinguish
;
and
Auriol
be
drag
through
the
doorway
from
which
he
have
be
bring
forth
.
