chapter
I
an
account
of
Mr
Gamaliel
Pickle
.
<EOS>
the
disposition
of
his
sister
describe
.
<EOS>
He
yield
to
her
sollicitation
,
and
retire
to
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
certain
county
of
England
,
bound
on
one
side
by
the
sea
,
and
at
the
distance
of
one
hundred
mile
from
the
metropolis
,
live
Gamaliel
Pickle
Esq
;
the
father
of
that
hero
whose
adventure
we
propose
to
record
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
son
of
a
merchant
in
London
,
who
(
like
Rome
)
from
small
beginning
,
have
raise
himself
to
the
high
honour
of
the
city
,
and
acquire
a
plentiful
fortune
,
tho
'
,
to
his
infinite
regret
,
he
die
before
it
amount
to
a
Plum
,
conjure
his
son
,
as
he
respect
the
last
injunction
of
a
parent
,
to
imitate
his
industry
and
adhere
to
his
maxim
,
until
he
should
have
make
up
the
deficiency
,
which
be
a
sum
considerably
less
than
fifteen
thousand
pound
.
    
<EOS>
this
pathetic
remonstrance
have
the
desire
effect
upon
his
representative
,
who
spare
no
pain
to
fulfil
the
request
of
the
deceased
;
but
exert
all
the
capacity
with
which
nature
have
endow
him
,
in
a
series
of
effort
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
succeed
;
for
,
by
that
time
he
have
be
fifteen
year
in
trade
,
he
find
himself
five
thousand
pound
bad
than
he
be
when
he
first
take
possession
of
his
father
's
effect
:
a
circumstance
that
affect
him
so
nearly
,
as
to
detach
his
inclination
from
business
,
and
induce
him
to
retire
from
the
world
,
to
some
place
where
he
may
at
leisure
deplore
his
misfortune
,
and
,
by
frugality
,
secure
himself
from
want
,
and
the
apprehension
of
a
jail
,
with
which
his
imagination
be
incessantly
haunt
.
<EOS>
He
be
often
hear
to
express
his
fear
of
come
upon
the
parish
;
and
to
bless
God
,
that
,
on
account
of
his
have
be
so
long
a
housekeeper
,
he
be
intitle
to
that
provision
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
talent
be
not
naturally
active
,
and
there
be
a
sort
of
inconsistency
in
his
character
;
for
,
with
all
the
desire
of
amass
which
any
citizen
could
possibly
entertain
,
he
be
encumber
by
a
certain
indolence
and
sluggishness
that
prevail
over
every
interested
consideration
,
and
even
hinder
him
from
profit
by
that
singleness
of
apprehension
,
and
moderation
of
appetite
,
which
have
so
frequently
conduce
to
the
acquisition
of
immense
fortune
,
and
which
he
possess
in
a
very
remarkable
degree
.
<EOS>
nature
,
in
all
probability
,
have
mix
little
or
nothing
inflammable
in
his
composition
;
or
,
whatever
seed
of
excess
she
may
have
sow
within
him
,
be
effectually
stifle
and
destroy
by
the
austerity
of
his
education
.
    
<EOS>
the
sally
of
his
youth
,
far
from
be
inordinate
or
criminal
,
never
exceed
the
bound
of
that
decent
jollity
which
an
extraordinary
pot
,
on
extraordinary
occasion
,
may
be
suppose
to
have
produce
in
a
club
of
sedate
book
-
keeper
,
whose
imagination
be
neither
very
warm
nor
luxuriant
.
<EOS>
little
subject
to
refined
sensation
,
he
be
scarce
ever
disturb
with
violent
emotion
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
the
passion
of
love
never
interrupt
his
tranquillity
;
and
if
,
as
Mr
Creech
say
after
Horace
,
    
not
to
admire
be
all
the
art
,
I
know
;
  
to
make
man
happy
,
and
to
keep
them
so
;
    
Mr
Pickle
be
undoubtedly
possess
of
that
invaluable
secret
;
at
least
,
he
be
never
know
to
betray
the
faint
symptom
of
transport
,
except
one
evening
at
the
club
,
where
he
observe
,
with
some
demonstration
of
vivacity
,
that
he
have
dine
upon
a
delicate
loin
of
veal
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
appearance
of
phlegm
,
he
could
not
help
feel
his
disappointment
in
trade
;
and
upon
the
failure
of
a
certain
underwriter
,
by
which
he
lose
five
hundred
pound
,
declare
his
design
of
relinquishing
business
,
and
retire
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
in
this
resolution
he
be
comfort
and
encourage
by
his
only
sister
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
have
manage
his
family
,
since
the
death
of
his
father
,
and
be
now
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
her
maidenhood
,
with
a
fortune
of
five
thousand
pound
,
and
a
large
stock
of
oeconomy
and
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
these
qualification
,
one
would
think
,
may
have
be
the
mean
of
abridge
the
term
of
her
celibacy
,
as
she
never
express
any
aversion
for
wedlock
;
but
,
it
seem
,
she
be
too
delicate
in
her
choice
,
to
find
a
mate
to
her
inclination
in
the
city
:
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
suppose
that
she
remain
so
long
unsollicited
;
tho
'
the
charm
of
her
person
be
not
altogether
enchanting
,
nor
her
manner
over
and
above
agreeable
.
<EOS>
exclusive
of
a
very
wan
<EOS>
(
not
to
call
it
a
sallow
)
complexion
,
which
perhaps
be
the
effect
of
her
virginity
and
mortification
,
she
have
a
cast
in
her
eye
that
be
not
at
all
engage
,
and
such
an
extent
of
mouth
,
as
no
art
or
affectation
could
contract
into
any
proportionable
dimension
:
then
her
piety
be
rather
peevish
than
resign
,
and
do
not
in
the
least
diminish
a
certain
stateliness
in
her
demeanour
and
conversation
,
that
delight
in
communicate
the
importance
and
honour
of
her
family
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
not
to
be
trace
two
generation
back
,
by
all
the
power
of
heraldry
or
tradition
.
    
<EOS>
She
seem
to
have
renounce
all
the
idea
she
have
acquire
before
her
father
serve
the
office
of
sheriff
;
and
the
aera
which
regulate
the
date
of
all
her
observation
,
be
the
mayoralty
of
her
papa
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
sollicitous
be
this
good
lady
for
the
support
and
propagation
of
the
family
-
name
,
that
,
suppress
every
selfish
motive
,
she
actually
prevail
upon
her
brother
to
combat
his
own
disposition
,
and
even
surmount
it
so
far
,
as
to
declare
a
passion
for
the
person
whom
he
afterwards
wed
,
as
we
shall
see
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
the
spur
that
instigate
him
in
all
his
extraordinary
undertaking
;
and
I
question
whether
or
not
he
would
have
be
able
to
disengage
himself
from
that
course
of
life
in
which
he
have
so
long
mechanically
moved
,
unless
he
have
be
rouse
and
actuate
by
her
incessant
exhortation
.
    
<EOS>
London
,
she
observe
,
be
a
receptacle
of
iniquity
,
where
an
honest
unsuspecting
man
be
every
day
in
danger
of
fall
a
sacrifice
to
craft
;
where
innocence
be
expose
to
continual
temptation
,
and
virtue
eternally
persecute
by
malice
and
slander
;
where
every
thing
be
rule
by
caprice
and
corruption
,
and
merit
utterly
discourage
and
despised
.
<EOS>
this
last
imputation
she
pronounce
with
such
emphasis
and
chagrin
,
as
plainly
denote
how
far
she
consider
herself
an
example
of
what
she
advance
;
and
really
,
the
charge
be
justify
by
the
construction
that
be
put
upon
her
retreat
by
her
female
friend
,
who
,
far
from
impute
it
to
the
laudable
motive
that
induce
her
,
insinuate
,
in
sarcastic
commendation
,
that
she
have
good
reason
to
be
dissatisfy
with
a
place
where
she
have
be
so
long
overlook
;
and
that
it
be
certainly
her
wise
course
to
make
her
last
effort
in
the
country
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
her
talent
would
be
less
eclipsed
,
and
her
fortune
more
attractive
.
    
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
her
admonition
<EOS>
,
tho
'
they
be
powerful
enough
to
convince
,
would
have
be
insufficient
to
overcome
the
languor
and
vis
inertiae
of
her
brother
,
have
she
not
reinforce
her
argument
,
by
call
in
question
the
credit
of
two
or
three
merchant
,
with
whom
he
be
embark
in
trade
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
these
hint
of
intelligence
,
he
exert
himself
effectually
;
and
have
withdraw
his
money
,
which
he
have
lay
out
in
Bank
stock
and
India
bond
,
remove
to
a
house
in
the
country
,
that
his
father
have
build
near
the
sea
-
side
,
for
the
convenience
of
carry
on
a
certain
branch
of
traffick
in
which
he
have
be
deeply
concerned
.
    
<EOS>
here
then
Mr
Pickle
fix
his
habitation
for
life
,
in
the
six
-
and
-
thirtieth
year
of
his
age
;
and
tho
'
the
pang
he
feel
at
part
with
his
intimate
companion
,
and
quit
all
his
former
connexion
,
be
not
quite
so
keen
as
to
produce
any
dangerous
disorder
in
his
constitution
,
he
do
not
fail
to
be
extremely
disconcert
at
his
first
entrance
into
a
scene
of
life
to
which
he
be
totally
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
he
meet
with
abundance
of
people
in
the
country
,
who
,
in
consideration
of
his
fortune
,
court
his
acquaintance
,
and
breathe
nothing
but
friendship
and
hospitality
:
yet
even
the
trouble
of
receive
and
return
these
civility
,
be
an
intolerable
fatigue
to
a
man
of
his
habit
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
leave
the
care
of
the
ceremonial
to
his
sister
,
who
indulge
herself
in
all
the
pride
of
formality
,
while
he
himself
,
have
make
a
discovery
of
a
public
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
go
thither
every
evening
,
and
enjoy
his
pipe
and
cann
;
be
very
well
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
the
landlord
,
whose
communicative
temper
be
a
great
comfort
to
his
own
taciturnity
;
for
he
shun
all
superfluity
of
speech
,
as
much
as
he
avoid
any
other
unnecessary
expence
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
II
<EOS>
He
be
make
acquainted
with
the
character
of
Commodore
Trunnion
and
his
adherent
;
meet
with
them
by
accident
,
and
contract
an
intimacy
with
that
commander
.
  
<EOS>
this
loquacious
publican
soon
give
him
sketch
of
all
the
character
in
the
county
;
and
,
among
other
,
describe
that
of
his
next
neighbour
Commodore
Trunnion
,
which
be
altogether
singular
and
odd
.
    
<EOS>
"
the
commodore
and
your
worship
(
say
he
)
will
in
a
short
time
be
hand
and
glove
;
he
have
a
power
of
money
,
and
spend
like
a
prince
 
that
is
,
in
his
own
way
  
for
to
be
sure
he
be
a
little
humoursome
,
as
the
saying
be
,
and
swear
woundily
;
tho
'
I
will
be
swear
<EOS>
he
mean
no
more
harm
than
a
suck
babe
.
<EOS>
Lord
help
us
!
<EOS>
it
will
do
your
honour
's
heart
good
to
hear
him
tell
a
story
,
as
how
he
lie
along
-
side
of
the
French
,
yard
-
arm
and
yard
-
arm
,
board
and
board
,
and
of
heave
grappling
,
and
stink
-
pot
,
and
grape
,
and
round
and
double
-
head
partridge
,
crow
and
carter
 
Laud
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
he
have
be
a
great
warrior
in
his
time
,
and
lose
an
eye
and
a
heel
in
the
service
  
<EOS>
then
,
he
do
not
live
like
any
other
christian
land
-
man
;
but
keep
garrison
in
his
house
,
as
if
he
be
in
the
midst
of
his
enemy
,
and
make
his
servant
turn
out
in
the
night
,
watch
and
watch
(
as
he
call
it
)
<EOS>
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
His
habitation
be
defend
by
a
ditch
,
over
which
he
have
lay
a
draw
-
bridge
,
and
plant
his
court
-
yard
with
patereroe
continually
load
with
shot
,
under
the
direction
of
one
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
have
one
of
his
leg
shoot
away
,
while
he
act
as
lieutenant
on
board
of
the
commodore
's
ship
;
and
now
,
be
on
half
-
pay
,
live
with
him
as
his
companion
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
be
a
very
brave
man
,
a
great
joker
,
and
,
as
the
saying
be
,
hath
get
the
length
of
his
commander
's
foot
 
Tho
'
he
have
another
favourite
in
the
house
call
Tom
Pipes
<EOS>
,
that
be
his
boatswain
's
mate
,
and
now
keep
the
servant
in
order
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
be
a
man
of
few
word
,
but
an
excellent
hand
at
a
song
concern
the
boatswain
's
whistle
,
husslecap
and
chuck
-
farthing
 
there
be
not
such
another
pipe
in
the
county
 
so
that
the
commodore
live
very
happy
in
his
own
manner
;
thof
he
be
sometimes
throw
into
perilous
passion
and
quandary
,
by
the
application
of
his
poor
kinsman
,
whom
he
can
not
abide
,
because
as
how
some
of
them
be
the
first
occasion
of
his
go
to
sea
.
<EOS>
then
he
sweat
with
agony
at
the
sight
of
an
attorney
;
just
for
all
the
world
,
as
some
people
have
an
antipathy
at
a
cat
;
for
it
seem
he
be
once
at
law
,
for
strike
one
of
his
officer
,
and
cast
in
a
swinging
sum
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
exceedingly
afflict
with
goblin
that
disturb
his
rest
,
and
keep
such
a
racket
in
his
house
,
that
you
would
think
(
God
bless
us
!
)
<EOS>
all
the
devil
in
hell
have
break
loose
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
ago
than
last
year
about
this
time
,
that
he
be
torment
the
live
-
long
night
by
two
mischievous
spirit
that
get
into
his
chamber
,
and
play
a
thousand
prank
about
his
hammock
,
<EOS>
(
for
there
be
not
one
bed
within
his
wall
.
)
<EOS>
well
,
Sir
,
he
ring
his
bell
,
call
up
all
his
servant
,
get
light
,
and
make
a
thorough
search
;
but
the
devil
a
goblin
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
turn
in
again
,
and
the
rest
of
the
family
go
to
sleep
,
than
the
foul
fiend
begin
their
game
anew
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
get
up
in
the
dark
,
draw
his
cutlass
,
and
attack
them
both
so
manfully
,
that
,
in
five
minute
,
every
thing
in
the
apartment
go
to
piece
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
hear
the
noise
,
come
to
his
assistance
;
and
Tom
Pipes
be
tell
what
be
the
matter
,
light
his
match
,
and
go
down
to
the
yard
,
fire
all
the
patereroe
,
as
signal
of
distress
.
    
<EOS>
well
,
to
be
sure
,
the
whole
parish
be
in
a
pucker
:
some
think
the
French
have
land
;
other
imagine
the
commodore
's
house
be
beset
by
thief
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
call
up
two
dragoon
that
be
quarter
upon
me
;
and
they
swear
with
deadly
oath
,
it
be
a
gang
of
smuggler
engage
with
a
party
of
their
regiment
that
lie
in
the
next
village
;
and
mount
their
horse
like
lusty
fellow
,
ride
up
into
the
country
as
fast
as
their
beast
could
carry
them
.
<EOS>
ah
,
Master
!
<EOS>
these
be
hard
time
,
when
an

the

continue

conjure
the

the

be
pretty
quiet

<EOS>
true
it

Mr

make
a
mock
of
the
whole
affair
;
and
tell
his

in
this
very
blessed
spot
,
that
the
two
goblin
be
no
other
than
a
couple
of
jackdaw
which
have
fall
down
the
chimney
,
and
make
a
flapping
with
their
wing
up
and
down
the
apartment

<EOS>
but
the
commodore
,
who
be
very
choleric
,
and
do
not
like
to
be
jeer
,
fall
into
a
main
high
passion
,
and
storm
like
a
perfect
hurricane

swear
that
he
know
a
devil
from
a

He
own

indeed

that
the

deny
that
they

the
occasion
of
the
uproar

<EOS>
for
my

Master

I
believe
much
may
be
say
on
both
side
of
the
question

the

be
always
go
about

<EOS>
this
circumstantial
account

extraordinary
as

never

one
feature
in

Mr

have
hear
it

take
the
pipe
from

say
,
with
a
look
of
infinite
sagacity
and
deliberation
,
"
I
do
suppose
he
be
of
the
Cornish
Trunnions

sort
of

his

Sir

he
will
not
suffer
his

turn
them
into
an
out

Your

have
see
him
before
now

hither
every

drink
a
couple
of
cann

be
confine
to
his

this
fortnight

by
a
plaguy
fit
of

I
will
assure

be
a
good
penny
out

<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
Mr
Pickle
's
ear
be
salute
with
such
a
strange
noise
,
as
even
discompose
the
muscle
of
his
face
,
which
give
immediate
indication
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
this
composition
of
note
at
first
resemble
the
crying
of
quail
,
and
croaking
of
bull

frog
;
but
,
as
it
approach
nearer

he
could
distinguish
articulate
sound
pronounce
with
great
violence

in
such
a
cadence
as

scolding
thro

<EOS>
It
be
neither

but
a
surprising
mixture
of
both
,
employ
in
the
utterance
of
term
absolutely
unintelligible
to
our
wonder
merchant
,
who
have
just
open
his

express
his
curiosity

when

during

Mr

<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
exert
herself
in
find
a
proper
match
for
her
brother
;
who
be
accordingly
introduce
to
the
young
lady
whom
he
marry
in
due
season
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
the
more
circumstantial
in
open
the
character
of
trunnion
,
because
he
bear
a
considerable
share
in
the
course
of
these
memoir
;
but
,
now
it
be
high
time
to
resume
the
consideration
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
,
since
her
arrival
in
the
country
,
have
be
engross
by
a
double
care
,
namely
,
that
of
find
a
suitable
match
for
her
brother
,
and
a
comfortable
yoke
-
fellow
for
herself
.
    
<EOS>
neither
be
this
aim
the
result
of
any
sinister
or
frail
suggestion
,
but
the
pure
dictate
of
that
laudable
ambition
,
which
prompt
her
to
the
preservation
of
the
family
name
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
disintereste
be
she
in
this
pursuit
,
that
,
postpone
her
near
concern
,
or
at
least
leave
her
own
fate
to
the
silent
operation
of
her
charm
,
she
labour
with
such
indefatigable
zeal
in
behalf
of
her
brother
,
that
before
they
have
be
three
month
settle
in
the
country
,
the
general
topick
of
conversation
in
the
neighbourhood
,
be
an
intended
match
between
the
rich
Mr
Pickle
and
the
fair
miss
Appleby
,
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
live
in
the
next
parish
,
and
who
,
though
he
have
but
little
fortune
to
bestow
upon
his
child
,
have
to
(
use
his
own
phrase
)
replenish
their
vein
with
some
of
the
good
blood
in
the
county
.
    
<EOS>
this
young
lady
,
whose
character
and
disposition
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
have
investigate
to
her
own
satisfaction
,
be
destine
for
the
spouse
of
Mr
Pickle
,
and
an
overture
accordingly
make
to
her
father
,
who
be
overjoy
at
the
proposal
,
give
his
consent
without
hesitation
,
and
even
recommend
the
immediate
execution
of
the
project
with
such
eagerness
,
as
seem
to
indicate
either
a
suspicion
of
Mr
Pickle
's
constancy
,
or
a
diffidence
of
his
own
daughter
's
complexion
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
think
too
sanguine
,
to
keep
much
longer
cool
.
<EOS>
the
previous
point
be
thus
settle
,
our
merchant
,
at
the
instigation
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
go
to
visit
his
future
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
be
introduce
to
the
daughter
,
with
whom
he
have
,
that
same
afternoon
,
an
opportunity
of
be
alone
.
<EOS>
what
pass
in
that
interview
,
I
never
could
learn
,
though
from
the
character
of
the
suitor
,
the
reader
may
justly
conclude
that
she
be
not
much
teize
with
the
impertinence
of
his
address
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
I
believe
,
the
less
welcome
for
that
reason
;
certain
it
be
,
she
make
no
objection
to
his
taciturnity
,
and
when
her
father
communicate
his
resolution
,
acquiesce
with
the
most
pious
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
Mrs
Grizzle
,
in
order
to
give
the
lady
a
more
favourable
idea
of
his
intellect
than
what
his
conversation
could
possibly
inspire
,
be
resolve
to
dictate
a
letter
,
which
her
brother
should
transcribe
and
transmit
to
his
mistress
,
as
the
produce
of
his
own
understanding
;
and
have
actually
compose
a
very
tender
billet
for
this
purpose
;
yet
her
intention
be
intirely
frustrate
by
the
misapprehension
of
the
lover
himself
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
his
sister
's
repeat
admonition
,
anticipate
her
scheme
,
by
write
for
himself
,
and
dispatch
the
letter
one
afternoon
,
while
Mrs
Grizzle
be
visit
at
the
parson
's
.
    
<EOS>
neither
be
this
step
the
effect
of
his
vanity
or
precipitation
;
but
have
be
often
assure
by
his
sister
,
that
it
be
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
make
a
declaration
of
his
love
in
writing
,
he
take
this
opportunity
of
act
in
conformity
to
her
advice
,
when
his
imagination
be
unengage
or
undisturbed
by
any
other
suggestion
,
without
suspect
in
the
least
,
that
she
intend
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
exercise
his
own
genius
.
<EOS>
leave
,
therefore
,
as
he
imagine
,
to
his
own
invention
,
he
sit
down
and
produce
the
follow
morceau
,
which
be
transmit
to
miss
Appleby
,
before
his
sister
and
counsellor
have
the
least
intimation
of
the
affair
.

nay

I
believe

its

plainness

a

often
consider
the
flowery
profession

rapturous
exclamation
of
love

as
ensnare
ambiguity

at
good
impertinent
preliminary

that
retard

in

demand
a
formal
explanation
of
his

without

,
they
have
contract
a
sort
of
intimacy
at
their
nocturnal
rendezvous
.
    
<EOS>
They
have
receive
a
previous
intimation
of
what
be
on
the
anvil
,
from
the
landlord
,
before
Mr
Pickle
think
proper
to
declare
himself
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
topick
of
the
one
eyed
commander
's
discourse
at
their
meeting
for
several
evening
before
,
have
be
the
folly
and
plague
of
matrimony
;
on
which
he
hold
forth
with
great
vehemence
of
abuse
,
level
at
the
fair
sex
,
whom
he
represent
as
devil
incarnate
send
from
hell
,
to
torment
mankind
;
and
in
particular
,
inveigh
against
old
maid
,
for
whom
he
seem
to
entertain
a
singular
aversion
;
while
his
friend
Jack
confirm
the
truth
of
all
his
allegation
,
and
gratify
his
own
malignant
vein
at
the
same
time
,
by
clench
every
sentence
with
a
sly
joke
upon
the
married
state
,
build
upon
some
allusion
to
a
ship
or
sea
-
fare
life
.
<EOS>
He
compare
a
woman
to
a
great
gun
load
with
fire
,
brimstone
and
noise
,
which
be
violently
heat
,
will
bounce
and
fly
,
and
play
the
devil
,
if
you
do
not
take
special
care
of
her
breeching
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
be
like
a
hurricane
that
never
blow
from
one
quarter
,
but
veer
about
to
all
point
of
the
compass
:
he
liken
her
to
a
paint
galley
curiously
rig
,
with
a
leak
in
her
hold
,
which
her
husband
would
never
be
able
to
stop
.
<EOS>
He
observe
that
her
inclination
be
like
the
Bay
of
Biscay
;
for
why
?
<EOS>
because
you
may
heave
your
deep
sea
lead
long
enough
,
without
ever
reach
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
that
he
who
come
to
an
anchor
on
a
wife
,
may
find
himself
moor
in
damned
foul
ground
,
and
after
all
,
can
not
for
his
blood
slip
his
cable
;
and
that
for
his
own
part
,
thof
he
may
make
short
trip
for
pastime
,
he
would
never
embark
in
woman
on
the
voyage
of
life
,
because
he
be
afraid
of
founder
in
the
first
foul
weather
.
    
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
these
insinuation
make
some
impression
on
the
mind
of
Mr
Pickle
,
who
be
not
very
much
inclined
to
run
great
risk
of
any
kind
;
but
the
injunction
and
importunity
of
his
sister
,
who
be
bent
upon
the
match
,
over
-
balance
the
opinion
of
his
sea
friend
,
who
find
him
determine
to
marry
,
notwithstanding
all
the
hint
of
caution
they
have
throw
out
,
resolve
to
accept
his
invitation
,
and
honour
his
nuptial
with
their
presence
accordingly
.

<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
Mrs
Grizzle
at
the
wedding
,
with
an
account
of
the
guest
.
   
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
not
be
think
uncharitable
,
if
I
advance
by
way
of
conjecture
,
that
Mrs
Grizzle
,
on
this
grand
occasion
,
summon
her
whole
exertion
,
to
play
off
the
artillery
of
her
charm
,
upon
the
single
gentleman
who
be
invite
to
the
entertainment
:
<EOS>
sure
I
be
,
she
display
to
the
good
advantage
all
the
engage
quality
she
possess
:
<EOS>
her
affability
at
dinner
be
altogether
uncommon
,
her
attention
to
the
guest
be
superfluously
hospitable
,
her
tongue
be
sheathe
with
a
most
agreeable
and
infantine
lisp
,
her
address
be
perfectly
oblige
;
and
though
,
conscious
of
the
extraordinary
capacity
of
her
mouth
,
she
would
not
venture
to
hazard
a
laugh
,
she
model
her
lip
into
an
enchanting
simper
,
which
play
upon
her
countenance
all
day
long
;
nay
<EOS>
,
she
even
profit
by
that
defect
in
her
vision
we
have
already
observe
,
and
securely
contemplate
those
feature
which
be
most
to
her
likeing
,
while
the
rest
of
the
company
believe
her
regard
be
dispose
in
a
quite
contrary
direction
.
    
<EOS>
with
what
humility
of
complaisance
do
she
receive
the
compliment
of
those
who
could
not
help
praise
the
elegance
of
the
banquet
!
<EOS>
and
how
piously
do
she
seize
that
opportunity
of
commemorate
the
honour
of
her
fire
,
by
observe
that
it
be
no
merit
in
her
to
understand
something
of
entertainment
,
as
she
have
occasion
to
preside
at
so
many
,
during
the
mayoralty
of
her
papa
!
<EOS>
far
from
discover
the
least
symptom
of
pride
and
exultation
,
when
the
opulence
of
her
family
become
the
subject
of
conversation
,
she
assume
a
severity
of
countenance
;
and
after
have
moralize
on
the
vanity
of
rich
,
declare
that
those
who
look
upon
her
as
a
fortune
,
be
very
much
mistaken
;
for
her
father
have
leave
her
no
more
than
poor
five
thousand
pound
,
which
,
with
what
little
she
have
save
of
the
interest
since
his
death
,
be
all
she
have
to
depend
upon
:
indeed
,
if
she
have
place
her
chief
felicity
in
wealth
,
she
should
not
have
be
so
forward
in
destroy
her
own
expectation
,
by
advise
and
promote
the
event
at
which
they
be
now
so
happily
assemble
;
but
she
hope
she
should
always
have
virtue
enough
to
postpone
any
interested
consideration
,
when
it
should
happen
to
clash
with
the
happiness
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
finally
,
such
be
her
modesty
and
self
denial
,
that
she
industriously
inform
those
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
she
be
no
less
than
three
year
old
than
the
bride
;
though
have
she
add
ten
to
the
reckoning
,
she
would
have
commit
no
mistake
in
point
of
computation
.
    
<EOS>
to
contribute
as
much
as
lie
in
her
power
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
present
,
she
in
the
afternoon
regale
them
with
a
tune
on
the
harpsichord
,
accompany
with
her
voice
,
which
,
though
not
the
most
melodious
in
the
world
,
I
dare
say
,
would
have
be
equally
at
their
service
,
could
she
have
vye
with
Philomel
in
song
;
and
as
the
last
effort
of
her
complaisance
when
dancing
be
propose
,
she
be
prevail
upon
,
at
the
request
of
her
new
sister
,
to
open
the
ball
in
person
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
Mrs
Grizzle
be
the
principal
figure
in
this
festival
,
and
almost
eclipse
the
bride
,
who
far
from
seem
to
dispute
the
preheminence
,
very
wisely
allow
her
to
make
the
good
of
her
talent
;
content
herself
with
the
lot
to
which
fortune
have
already
call
her
,
and
which
she
imagine
would
not
be
the
less
desirable
,
if
her
sister
-
in
-
law
be
detach
from
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
I
need
scarce
advertise
the
reader
,
that
during
this
whole
entertainment
,
the
commodore
and
his
lieutenant
be
quite
out
of
their
element
;
and
this
indeed
,
be
the
case
with
the
bridegroom
himself
,
who
be
utterly
unacquainted
with
any
sort
of
polite
commerce
,
find
himself
under
a
very
disagreeable
restraint
during
the
whole
scene
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
,
who
have
scarce
ever
be
on
shore
till
he
be
pay
off
,
and
never
once
in
his
whole
life
,
in
the
company
of
any
female
above
the
rank
of
those
who
herd
upon
the
point
at
Portsmouth
,
be
more
embarrassed
about
his
behaviour
than
if
he
have
be
surround
at
sea
by
the
whole
french
navy
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
pronounce
the
word
Madam
since
he
be
bear
,
so
that
far
from
enter
into
conversation
with
the
lady
,
he
would
not
even
return
the
compliment
,
or
give
the
least
nod
of
civility
when
they
drink
to
his
health
;
and
I
verily
believe
,
would
rather
have
suffer
suffocation
,
than
allow
the
simple
phrase
,
your
servant
,
to
proceed
from
his
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
altogether
as
inflexible
with
respect
to
the
attitude
of
his
body
;
for
,
either
through
obstinacy
or
bashfulness
,
he
sit
upright
without
motion
,
insomuch
that
he
provoke
the
mirth
of
a
certain
wag
,
who
address
himself
to
the
lieutenant
,
ask
whether
that
be
the
commodore
himself
,
or
the
wooden
lion
that
use
to
stand
at
his
gate
?
<EOS>
an
image
to
which
,
it
must
be
own
,
Mr
Trunnion
's
person
bear
no
faint
resemblance
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
be
not
quite
so
unpolished
as
the
commodore
,
and
have
certain
notion
that
seem
to
approach
the
idea
of
common
life
,
make
a
less
uncouth
appearance
;
but
then
he
be
a
wit
,
and
though
of
a
very
peculiar
genius
,
partake
largely
of
that
disposition
which
be
common
to
all
wit
,
who
never
enjoy
themselves
,
except
when
their
talent
meet
with
those
mark
of
distinction
and
veneration
,
which
(
in
their
own
opinion
)
they
deserve
.
    
<EOS>
these
circumstance
be
premise
,
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
if
this
triumvirate
make
no
objection
to
the
proposal
,
when
some
of
the
grave
personage
of
the
company
make
a
motion
for
adjourn
into
another
apartment
,
where
they
may
enjoy
their
pipe
and
bottle
,
while
the
young
folk
indulge
themselves
in
the
continuance
of
their
own
favourite
diversion
.
    
<EOS>
thus
rescue
,
as
it
be
,
from
a
state
of
annihilation
,
the
first
use
the
two
lad
of
the
castle
make
of
their
existence
,
be
to
ply
the
bridegroom
so
hard
with
bumper
,
that
in
less
than
an
hour
he
make
diver
effort
to
sing
,
and
soon
after
be
carry
to
bed
,
deprive
of
all
manner
of
sensation
,
to
the
utter
disappointment
of
the
brideman
and
maid
,
who
,
by
this
accident
,
be
prevent
from
throw
the
stocking
,
and
perform
certain
other
ceremony
practise
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
bride
,
she
bear
this
misfortune
with
great
good
humour
,
and
indeed
,
on
all
occasion

behave
like

V
Mrs
Pickle
assume
the
rein
of
government
in
her
own
family

her
sister

in

undertake
an
enterprize
of
great
moment
;
but
be
for
some
time
divert
from
her
purpose
,
by
a
very
interesting
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
whatever
deference
,
not
to
say
submission
,
she
have
pay
to
Mrs
Grizzle
before
she
be
so
nearly
ally
to
her
family
,
she
no
sooner
become
Mrs
Pickle
,
than
she
think
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
act
up
to
the
dignity
of
the
character
;
and
the
very
day
after
the
marriage
,
venture
to
dispute
with
her
sister
in
-
law
on
the
subject
of
her
own
pedigree
,
which
she
affirm
to
be
more
honourable
in
all
respect
than
that
of
her
husband
;
observe
that
several
young
brother
of
her
house
have
arrive
at
the
station
of
lord
mayor
of
London
,
which
be
the
high
pitch
of
greatness
that
any
of
Mr
Pickle
's
predecessor
have
ever
attain
.
    
<EOS>
this
presumption
be
like
a
thunderbolt
to
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
begin
to
perceive
that
she
have
not
succeed
quite
so
well
as
she
imagine
,
in
select
for
her
brother
a
gentle
and
obedient
yoke
-
fellow
,
who
would
always
treat
her
with
that
profound
respect
which
she
think
due
to
her
superior
genius
,
and
be
entirely
regulate
by
her
advice
and
direction
:
however
,
she
still
continue
to
manage
the
rein
of
government
in
the
house
,
reprehend
the
servant
as
usual
;
an
office
she
perform
with
great
capacity
,
and
in
which
she
seem
to
take
singular
delight
,
until
Mrs
Pickle
,
on
pretence
of
consult
her
ease
,
tell
her
one
day
she
would
take
that
trouble
upon
herself
,
and
for
the
future
assume
the
management
of
her
own
family
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
mortifying
to
Mrs
Grizzle
than
such
a
declaration
,
to
which
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
and
strange
distortion
of
look
<EOS>
,
she
reply
,
"
I
shall
never
refuse
or
repine
at
any
trouble
that
may
conduce
to
my
brother
's
advantage
.
"
<EOS>
"
dear
madam
,
"
answer
the
sister
,
"
I
be
infinitely
oblige
to
your
kind
concern
for
Mr
Pickle
's
interest
,
which
I
consider
as
my
own
,
but
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
a
sufferer
by
your
friendship
;
and
therefore
,
insist
upon
exempt
you
from
the
fatigue
you
have
bear
so
long
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
the
other
protest
that
she
take
pleasure
in
the
task
;
Mrs
Pickle
ascribe
the
assurance
to
her
excess
of
complaisance
,
and
express
such
tenderness
of
zeal
for
her
dear
sister
's
health
and
tranquillity
,
that
the
reluctant
maiden
find
herself
oblige
to
resign
her
authority
,
without
enjoy
the
least
pretext
for
complain
of
her
be
depose
.
    
<EOS>
this
disgrace
be
attend
by
a
fit
of
peevish
devotion
that
last
three
or
four
week
;
during
which
period
,
she
have
the
additional
chagreen
of
see
the
young
lady
gain
an
absolute
ascendency
over
the
mind
of
her
brother
,
who
be
persuade
to
set
up
a
gay
equipage
,
and
improve
his
housekeeping
,
by
an
augmentation
in
his
expence
,
to
the
amount
of
a
thousand
a
year
at
least
:
tho
'
this
alteration
in
the
oeconomy
of
his
houshold
,
effect
no
change
in
his
own
disposition
,
or
manner
of
life
;
for
,
soon
as
the
painful
ceremony
of
receive
and
return
visit
be
perform
,
he
have
recourse
again
to
the
company
of
his
sea
-
friend
,
with
whom
he
spend
the
good
part
of
his
time
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
be
satisfied
with
his
condition
,
the
case
be
otherwise
with
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
find
her
importance
in
the
family
greatly
diminish
,
her
attraction
neglect
by
all
the
male
-
sex
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
wither
hand
of
time
hang
threatne
over
her
head
,
begin
to
feel
the
horror
of
eternal
virginity
,
and
in
a
sort
of
desperation
,
resolve
at
any
rate
to
rescue
herself
from
that
reproachful
and
uncomfortable
situation
.
<EOS>
thus
determine
,
she
form
a
plan
,
the
execution
of
which
,
to
a
spirit
less
enterprizing
and
sufficient
than
her
's
,
would
have
appear
altogether
impracticable
;
this
be
no
other
than
to
make
a
conquest
of
the
commodore
's
heart
,
which
the
reader
will
easily
believe
be
not
very
susceptible
of
tender
impression
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
fortify
with
insensibility
and
prejudice
against
the
charm
of
the
whole
sex
,
and
particularly
prepossess
to
the
prejudice
of
that
class
distinguish
by
the

She

which
by

she
could
construe
into

with
modesty

<EOS>
but
,
all
this
complacency
be
so
ineffectual
,
that
,
far
from
suspect
the
true
cause
of
it
,
the
commodore
,
that
very
evening
,
at
the

,
in

of
her
brother

with

,
by
this

he

do
not

and
immediately
after

a
toast

Mr

pledge
without
the
least
hesitation
,
and
next
day
intimate
to
his
sister
,
who
bear
the
indignity
with
surprising
resignation

and
do
not
therefore
desist
from
her
scheme

unpromising
as
it
seem

be

until

<EOS>
Her

have
not

many
month

when
she
exhibit
evident
symptom
of
pregnancy

to
the
general
satisfaction

(

already
hint
)
be
more
interested
in
the
preservation
of
the
family

than
in
any
other
consideration
whatever

<EOS>
She
therefore
no
sooner
discover
appearance
to
justify
and
confirm
her
hope
,
than
postpone
her
own
purpose
,
and
lay
aside
that
pique
and
resentment
she
have
conceive
from
the
behaviour
of
Mrs
Pickle
<EOS>
,
when
she
supersede
her
authority
;
or
perhaps
,
consider
her
in
no
other
light
than
that
of
the
vehicle
which

be
destine

with

with
that
sagacious
performance
dignify

She
restrict
her

and
all

and
one
day
when
Mrs

have
pluck
a
peach
with
her
own
hand

and
be
in
the
very
act
of
put
it
between

Mrs

perceive
the
rash
attempt

run
up
to
her

fall
upon
her
knee
in
the
garden
,
intreate
her

with
tear
in
her
eye

to
resist
such
a
pernicious
appetite

<EOS>
Her
request

if
her

longing
be
baulk

the
child
may
be
affect
with
some
disagreeable
mark
,
or
deplorable
disease

she
beg
as
earnestly
that
she
would
swallow
the
fruit
,
and
in
the
mean
time
run
for
some
cordial
water
of
her
own
composing
,
which
she
force
upon
her
sister
,
as
an
antidote
to
the
poison
she
have
receive
.
    
<EOS>
this
excessive
zeal
and
tenderness
do
not
fail
to
be
very
troublesome
to
Mrs

,
who
have
revolve
diver
plan
for
the
recovery
of
her
own
ease
,
at
length
determine
to
engage
Mrs
Grizzle
in
such
employment
as
would
interrupt
that
close
attendance
which
she
find
so
teizing
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
neither
do
she
wait
long
for
an
opportunity
of
put
her
resolution
in
practice
.
    
<EOS>
the
very
next
day
,
a
gentleman
happen
to
dine
with
Mr
Pickle
,
unfortunately
mention
a
pine
-
apple
,
part
of
which
he
have
eat
a
week
before
at
the
house
of
a
nobleman
who
live
in
another
part
of
the
country
,
at
the
distance
of
an
hundred
mile
at
least
.
    
<EOS>
the
name
of
this
fatal
fruit
be
no
sooner
pronounce
,
than
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
incessantly
watch
her
sister
's
look
,
take
the
alarm
,
because
she
think
they
give
certain
indication
of
curiosity
and
desire
;
and
after
have
observe
that
she
herself
never
could
eat
pine
-
apple
,
which
be
altogether
unnatural
production
,
extort
by
the
force
of
artificial
fire
,
out
of
filthy
manure
,
ask
with
a
faultere
voice
,
if
Mrs
Pickle
be
not
of
her
way
of
thinking
?
<EOS>
this
young
lady
,
who
want
neither
slyness
nor
penetration
,
at
once
divine
her
meaning
,
and
reply
with
seem
unconcern
,
that
for
her
own
part
she
should
never
repine
,
if
there
be
not
a
pine
-
apple
in
the
universe
,
provide
she
could
indulge
herself
with
the
fruit
of
her
own
country
.
    
<EOS>
this
answer
,
which
be
calculate
for
the
benefit
of
the
stranger
,
who
would
certainly
have
suffer
for
his
imprudence
by
the
resentment
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
have
her
sister
express
the
least
relish
for
the
fruit
in
question
:
I
say
,
this
answer
have
the
desire
effect
,
and
re
-
establish
the
peace
of
the
company
,
which
be
not
a
little
endanger
by
the
gentleman
's
want
of
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
however
,
after
breakfast
,
the
pregnant
lady
,
in
pursuance
of
her
plan
,
yawn
(
as
it
be
by
accident
)
full
in
the
face
of
her
maiden
sister
,
who
be
infinitely
disturb
by
this
convulsion
,
affirm
it
be
a
symptom
of
longing
;
and
insist
upon
know
the
object
in
desire
,
when
Mrs
Pickle
affect
an
affected
smile
,
tell
her
she
have
eat
a
most
delicious
pine
-
apple
in
her
sleep
.
<EOS>
this
declaration
be
attend
with
an
immediate
scream
utter
by
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
instantly
perceive
her
sister
surprize
at
the
exclamation
,
clasp
her
in
her
arm
,
and
assure
her
,
with
a
sort
of
hysterical
laugh
,
import
horror
rather
than
delight
,
that
she
could
not
help
scream
with
joy
,
because
she
have
it
in
her
power
to
gratify
her
dear
sister
's
wish
;
a
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
have
promise
to
send
her
,
in
a
present
,
a
couple
of
fine
pine
-
apple
,
which
she
would
that
very
day
go
in
quest
of
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Pickle
would
by
no
means
consent
to
this
proposal
,
on
pretence
of
spare
the
other
unnecessary
fatigue
;
and
assure
her
,
that
,
if
she
have
any
desire
to
eat
a
pine
-
apple
,
it
be
so
faint
,
that
the
disappointment
could
produce
no
bad
consequence
.
<EOS>
but
this
assurance
be
convey
in
a
manner
(
which
she
know
very
well
how
to
adopt
)
that
instead
of
dissuade
,
rather
stimulate
Mrs
Grizzle
to
set
out
immediately
,
not
on
a
visit
to
that
lady
,
whose
promise
she
herself
have
feign
with
a
view
of
consult
her
sister
's
tranquillity
,
but
on
a
random
search
thro
'
the
whole
county
for
this
unlucky
fruit
,
which
be
like
to
produce
so
much
vexation
and
prejudice
to
her
and
her
father
's
house
.
    
<EOS>
during
three
whole
day
and
night
,
do
she
,
attend
by
a
valet
,
ride
from
place
to
place
without
success
,
unmindful
of
her
health
,
and
careless
of
her
reputation
,
that
begin
to
suffer
from
the
nature
of
her
inquiry
,
which
be
pursue
with
such
peculiar
eagerness
and
distraction
,
that
every
body
with
whom
she
converse
,
look
upon
her
as
an
unhappy
person
,
whose
intellect
be
not
a
little
disorder
.
    
<EOS>
baffle
in
all
her
research
within
the
county
,
she
at
length
resolve
to
visit
that
very
nobleman
,
at
whose
house
the
officious
stranger
have
be
(
for
her
)
so
unfortunately
regale
,
and
actually
arrive
in
a
post
-
chaise
at
the
place
of
his
habitation
,
where
she
introduce
her
business
as
an
affair
on
which
the
happiness
of
a
whole
family
depend
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
have
come
too
late
;
his
lordship
lament
,
in
very
polite
and
pathetic
term
,
that
he
be
disabled
from
exert
his
humanity
,
and
enjoy
the
pleasure
<EOS>
he
should
feel
in
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
his
fellow

creature
,
at
such
an
easy
rate

tell
her
,
that
he
have
unluckily
,
the
very
day
before
,
send
the
two
last
pine
-
apple
his
garden
have
produce
,
in
a
present
to
a
certain
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
be
so
affected
with
this
explanation
,
that
she
faint
away
,
and
be
immediately
carry
to
the
public
house
,
where
she
have
leave
her
horse
,
and
where
she
remain
inconsolable
for
the
disappointment
,
which
in
all
likelihood
would
have
prove
more
fatal
to
her
than
to
the
person
for
whom
she
be
so
piously
concern
,
have
not
she
in
the
evening
,
by
the
medium
of
her
own
servant

receive
a
hint
from
the
nobleman

gardener

that
for
five
piece
she
should
be
furnish
with
a
couple
of
as
fine
apple
as
ever
be
see
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
term
(
I
scarce
need
say
)
be
greedily
embrace
,
the
fruit
secure
in
her
possession
;
and
she
depart
that
very
night
on
her

chapter

<EOS>
Mrs

Peregrine

who

upon
that
account
;
and
resume
the
plan
which
she
have
before
reject
.
   
<EOS>
the
success
of
this
device
would
have
encourage
Mrs
Pickle
to
practise
more
of
the
same
sort
upon
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
have
she
not
be
deter
by
a
violent
fever
which
seize
her
zealous

in
consequence
of
the
fatigue

uneasiness
she

as
effectually
conduce
to
her
repose

as
any
other
stratagem
she
could
invent

but
Mrs

's
health

than
the

be
as
much
incommode
as
ever

be
oblige

in
her
own
defence
,
to
have
recourse
to
some
other
contrivance
;
and
manage
her
artifice
in
such
a
manner
,
as
leave
it
at
this
day
a
doubt
whether
she
be
really
so
whimsical
and
capricious
in
her
appetite
as
she
herself
pretend
to
be
;
for
her
longing
be
not
restrict
to
the
demand
of
the
palate
and
stomach
,
but
also
affect
all
the
other
organ
of
sense
,
and
even
invade
her
imagination
,
which
at
this
period
seem
to
be
strangely
disease
.
    
<EOS>
one
time
she
long
to
pinch
her
husband
's
ear
;
and
it
be
with
infinite
difficulty
that
his
sister
could
prevail
upon
him
to
undergo
the
operation
.
<EOS>
yet
this
task
be
easy
,
in
comparison
with
another
she
undertake
for
the
gratification
of
Mrs
Pickle
's
unaccountable
desire
;
which
be
no
other
than
to
persuade
the
commodore
to
submit
his
chin
to
the
mercy
of
the
big
-
bellied
lady
,
who
ardently
wish
for
an
opportunity
of
pluck
three
black
hair
from
his
beard
.
<EOS>
when
this
proposal
be
first
communicate
to
Mr
Trunnion
by
the
husband
,
his
answer
be
nothing
but
a
dreadful
effusion
of
oath
,
accompany
with
such
a
stare
,
and
deliver
in
such
a
tone
of
voice
,
as
terrify
the
poor
beseecher
into
immediate
silence
;
so
that
Mrs
Grizzle
be
fain
to
take
the
whole
enterprize
upon
herself
,
and
next
day
go
to
the
garrison
accordingly
,
where
have
obtain
entrance
by
mean
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
,
while
his
commander
be
asleep
,
order
her
to
be
admit
for
the
joke
's
sake
,
she
wait
patiently
till
he
turn
out
,
and
then
accost
him
in
the
yard
,
where
he
use
to
perform
his
morning
walk
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
thunder

strike
at
the
appearance
of
a
woman
in
a
place
which
he
have
hitherto
keep
sacred
from
the
whole
sex
,
and
immediately
begin
to
utter
an
apostrophe
to
Tom
Pipes
,
whose
turn
it
be
then
to
watch
;
when
Mrs
Grizzle
fall
on
her
knee
before
him
,
conjure
him
with
many
pathetic
supplication
,
to
hear
and
grant
her
request
,
which
be
no
sooner
signify
,
than
he
bellow
in
such
an
outragious
manner
,
that
the
whole
court
re
-
ecchoe
the
opprobrious
term
bitch
;
and
the
word
damnation
which
he
repeat
with
surprising
volubility
,
without
any
sort
of
propriety
or
connection
;
and
retreat
into
his
penetralia
,
leave
the
baffle
devotee
in
the
humble
posture
she
have
so
unsuccessfully
choose
to
melt
his
obdurate
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Mortifying
<EOS>
as
this
repulse
must
have
be
to
a
lady
of
her
stately
disposition
,
she
do
not
relinquish
her
aim
,
but
endeavour
to
interest
the
commodore
's
counsellor
and
adherent
in
her
cause

<EOS>
with
this
view
she
sollicite
the
interest
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
be
highly
pleased
with
a
circumstance
in
all
probability
so
productive
of
mirth
and
diversion

readily
enter
into
her
measure
,
and
promise
to
employ
his
whole
influence
for
her
satisfaction
:
and
as
for
the
boatswain
's
mate
,
he
be
render
propitious
by
the
present
of
a
guinea
which
she
slipt
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mrs
Grizzle
be
continually
engage
in
this
negotiation
for
the
space
of
ten
day
,
during
which
the
commodore
be
so
incessantly
pester
with
her
remonstrance
,
and
the
admonition
of
his
associate
,
that
he
swear
his
people
have
a
design
upon
his
life
,
which
become
a
burthen
to
him
,
he
at
last
complied
,
and
be
conduct
to
the
scene
like
a
victim
to
the
altar
,
by
the
exult
priest
;
or
rather
growl
like
a
reluctant
bear

lead

the
stake

the
shout

cry

<EOS>
after
all

this
victory

and
the
performer

with

disconcert
,
have
recourse
to
a
magnify
glass
that
stand
upon
her
toilette
;
and
after
a
most
accurate
examination
,
discover
a
fibre
of
a
dusky
hue
,
to
which
the
instrument
be
apply
,
Mrs
Pickle
pull
it
up
by
the
root
,
to
the
no
small
discomposure
of
the
owner
,
who
feel
the
smart
much
more
severe
than
he
have
expect
,
start
up
,
and
swear
he
would
not
part
with
another
hair
to
save
them
all
from
damnation
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Hatchway
exhort
him
to
patience
and
resignation
,
Mrs
Grizzle
repeat
her
intreatie
with
great
humility
;
but
find
him
deaf
to
all
her
prayer
,
and
absolutely
bent
upon
leave
the
house
,
she
clasp
his
knee
,
and
beg
for
the
love
of
God
that
he
would
have
compassion
upon
a
distressed
family
,
and
endure
a
little
more
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
infant
,
who
would
otherwise
be
bear
with
a
grey
beard
upon
its
chin
.
<EOS>
far
from
be
melt
,
he
be
rather
exasperate
by
this
reflection
;
to
which
he
reply
with
great
indignation
,
"
damn
ye
for
a
yaw
-
sight
bitch
!
<EOS>
he
will
be
hang
long
enough
before
he
have
any
beard
at
all
:
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
disengage
himself
from
her
embrace
,
fling
out
at
the
door
,
and
halt
homeward
with
such
surprising
speed
,
that
the
lieutenant
could
not
overtake
him
until
he
have
arrive
at
his
own
gate
;
and
Mrs
Grizzle
be
so
much
affected
with
his
escape
,
that
her
sister
,
in
pure
compassion
,
desire
she
would
not
afflict
herself
,
protest
that
her
own
wish
be
already
gratify
,
for
she
have
pluck
three
hair
at
once
,
have
from
the
beginning
be
dubious
of
the
commodore
's
forbearance
.
    
<EOS>
but
the
labour
of
this
assiduous
kinswoman
do
not
end
with
the
atchievement
of
this
adventure
:
her
eloquence
or
industry
be
employ
without
cease
,
in
the
performance
of
other
task
impose
by
the
ingenious
craft
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
at
another
time
conceive
an
insuppressible
affection
for
a
fricassee
of
frog
,
which
should
be
the
genuine
native
of
France
;
so
that
there
be
a
necessity
for
dispatch
a
messenger
on
purpose
to
that
kingdom
:
<EOS>
but
as
she
could
not
depend
upon
the
integrity
of
any
common
servant
,
Mrs
Grizzle
undertake
that
province
,
and
actually
set
sail
in
a
cutter
for
Bologne
,
<EOS>
from
whence
she
return
in
eight
and
forty
hour
with
a
tub
full
of
those
live
animal
,
which
be
dress
accord
to
art
,
her
sister
would
not
taste
them
,
on
pretence
that
her
fit
of
longing
be
past
:
but
then
her
inclination
take
a
different
turn
,
and
fix
themselves
upon
a
curious
implement
belong
to
a
lady
of
quality
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
be
report
to
be
a
very
great
curiosity
;
this
be
no
other
than
a
porcelain
chamber
-
pot
of
admirable
workmanship
,
contrive
by
the
honourable
owner
,
who
keep
it
for
her
own
private
use
,
and
cherish
it
as
an
utensil
of
inestimable
value
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
shudder
at
the
first
hint
she
receive
of
her
sister
's
desire
to
possess
this
piece
of
furniture
;
because
she
know
it
be
not
to
be
purchase
;
and
the
lady
's
character
,
which
be
none
of
the
most
amiable
in
point
of
humanity
and
condescension
,
forbad
all
hope
of
borrow
it
for
a
season
;
she
therefore
attempt
to
reason
down
this
capricious
appetite
,
as
an
extravagance
of
imagination
which
ought
to
be
combat
and
repress
;
and
Mrs
Pickle
,
to
all
appearance
,
be
convince
and
satisfied
by
her
argument
and
advice
:
but
nevertheless
,
could
make
use
of
no
other
convenience
,
and
be
threaten
with
a
very
dangerous
suppression
.
    
<EOS>
rouze
at
the
peril
in
which
she
suppose
her
to
be
,
Mrs
Grizzle
fly
to
the
lady
's
house
,
and
have
obtain
a
private
audience
,
disclose
the
melancholy
situation
of
her
sister
,
and
implore
the
benevolence
of
her
ladyship
,
who
,
contrary
to
expectation
,
receive
her
very
graciously
,
and
consent
to
indulge
Mrs
Pickle
's
longing
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
have
not
the
pleasure
of
be
acquaint
with
the
family
,
she
hope
it
would
not
be
take
amiss
,
if
she
insist
upon
security
for
her
own
indemnification
,
in
case
any
accident
should
happen
to
the
machine
while
under
their
protection
.
<EOS>
overjoy
at
this
condescension
,
Mrs
Grizzle
be
loud
in
her
acknowledgment
,
embrace
the
term
of
the
loan
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
an
hundred
guinea
be
deposit
,
and
bring
home
this
illustrious
Jordan
,
with
as
much
pleasure
and
satisfaction
,
as
the
argonaut
enjoy
when
they
make
themselves
master
of
the
golden
fleece
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
her
success
be
attend
with
a
small
disaster
,
which
she
could
not
possibly
foresee
:
next
day
it
be
,
at
the
desire
of
Mrs
Pickle
,
commit
to
the
charge
of
a
trusty
servant
,
who
,
in
carry
it
back
to
the
right
owner
,
have
the
misfortune
to
be
overturn
by
one
of
her
ladyship
's
valet
who
run
against
him
in
the
court
;
and
this
superb
piece
of
porcelain
fall
upon
the
pavement
,
be
dash
into
a
thousand
piece
.
<EOS>
in
vain
do
the
poor
carrier
urge
his
own
innocence
,
by
represent
the
true
cause
of
this
misadventure
;
her
ladyship
be
deaf
to
all
his
proof
and
protestation
,
and
without
any
ceremony
,
detain
the
pledge
which
have
be
leave
in
her
hand
;
not
without
violent
suspicion
of
have
act
as
the
auxiliary
of
chance
,
to
which
this
calamity
be
impute
.
    
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
Mr
Pickle
begin
to
be
out
of
humour
at
the
expence
to
which
he
be
expose
by
the
caprice
of
his
wife
,
who
be
herself
alarm
at
this
last
accident
,
and
for
the
future
keep
her
fancy
within
bound
,
insomuch
,
that
without
be
subject
to
any
more
extraordinary
trouble
,
Mrs
Grizzle
reap
the
long
wish
fruit
of
her
dear
expectation
in
the
birth
of
a
fine
boy
,
whom
her
sister
in
a
few
month
bring
into
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
omit
the
description
of
the
rejoicing
,
which
be
infinite
on
this
important
occasion
,
and
only
observe
that
Mrs
Pickle
's
mother
and
aunt
stand
godmother
,
and
the
commodore
assist
at
the
ceremony
as
godfather
to
the
child
,
who
be
christen
by
the
name
of
Peregrine
,
in
compliment
to
the
memory
of
a
deceased
uncle
.
<EOS>
while
the
mother
be
confine
to
her
bed
,
and
incapable
of
maintain
her
own
authority
,
Mrs
Grizzle
take
charge
of
the
infant
by
a
double
claim
;
and
superintend
with
surprize
vigilance
the
nurse
and
midwife
in
all
the
particular
of
their
respective
office
,
which
be
perform
by
her
express
direction
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
be
Mrs
Pickle
in
a
condition
to
re
-
assume
the
management
of
her
own
affair
,
than
she
think
proper
to
alter
certain
regulation
concern
the
child
,
which
have
obtain
in
consequence
of
her
sister
's
order
,
direct
,
among
other
innovation
,
that
the
bandage
with
which
the
infant
have
be
so
neatly
roll
up
,
like
an
aegyptian
mummy
,
should
be
loosen
and
lay
aside
,
in
order
to
rid
nature
of
all
restraint
,
and
give
the
blood
free
scope
to
circulate
;
and
with
her
own
hand
she
plunge
him
headlong
every
morning
in
a
tub
-
full
of
cold
water
.
    
<EOS>
this
operation
seem
so
barbarous
to
the
tender
-
hearted
Mrs
Grizzle
,
that
she
not
only
oppose
it
with
all
her
eloquence
,
shed
abundance
of
tear
over
the
sacrifice
when
it
be
make
;
but
take
horse
immediately
,
and
depart
for
the
habitation
of
an
eminent
country
physician
,
whom
she
consult
in
these
word
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
doctor
,
be
it
not
both
dangerous
and
cruel
to
be
the
mean
of
let
a
poor
tender
infant
perish
,
by
souse
it
in
water
as
cold
as
ice
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
reply
the
doctor
,
downright
murder
,
I
affirm
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
be
a
person
of
great
learning
and
sagacity
,
say
the
other
;
and
I
must
beg
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
signify
your
opinion
in
your
own
hand
-
writing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
immediately
comply
with
her
request
,
and
express
himself
upon
a
slip
of
paper
to
this
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
these
be
to
certify
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
I
firmly
believe
,
and
it
be
my
unalterable
opinion
,
that
whosoever
letteth
an
infant
perish
,
by
souse
it
in
cold
water
,
even
though
the
say
water
should
not
be
so
cold
as
ice
,
be
in
effect
,
guilty
of
the
murder
of
the
say
infant
,
as
witness
my
hand
 
Comfit
Colocynth
.
    
<EOS>
have
obtain
this
certificate
,
for
which
the
physician
be
handsomely
acknowledge
,
she
return
in
triumph
,
hope
,
with
such
authority
,
to
overthrow
all
opposition
;
and
accordingly
next
morning
,
when
her
nephew
be
about
to
undergo
his
diurnal
baptism
,
produce
the
commission
,
whereby
she
conceive
herself
impowere
to
overrule
such
inhuman
proceeding
.
    
<EOS>
but
she
be
disappoint
in
her
expectation
,
confident
as
it
be
;
not
that
Mrs
Pickle
pretend
to
differ
in
opinion
from
Dr
Colocynth
,
"
for
whose
character
and
sentiment
<EOS>
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
have
such
veneration
,
that
I
shall
carefully
observe
the
caution
imply
in
this
very
certificate
,
by
which
,
far
from
condemn
my
method
of
practice
,
he
only
assert
that
kill
be
murder
;
an
asseveration
,
the
truth
of
which
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
I
shall
never
dispute
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
,
sooth
to
say
,
have
rather
too
superficially
consider
the
clause
by
which
she
think
herself
authorize
,
peruse
the
paper
with
more
accuracy
,
and
be
confound
at
her
own
want
of
penetration
.
<EOS>
yet
,
though
she
be
confute
,
she
be
by
no
mean
convince
that
her
objection
to
the
cold
bath
be
unreasonable
;
on
the
contrary
,
after
have
bestow
sundry
opprobrious
epithet
on
the
physician
,
for
his
want
of
knowledge
and
candour
,
she
protest
in
the
most
earnest
and
solemn
manner
against
the
pernicious
practice
of
dip
the
child
;
a
piece
of
cruelty
,
which
with
God
's
assistance
,
she
should
never
suffer
to
be
inflict
on
her
own
issue
;
and
wash
her
hand
of
the
melancholy
consequence
that
would
certainly
ensue
,
shut
herself
up
in
her
closet
,
to
indulge
her
sorrow
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
She
be
deceive
,
however
,
in
her
prognostic
;
the
boy
,
instead
of
decline
in
point
of
health
,
seem
to
acquire
fresh
vigour
from
every
plunge
,
as
if
he
have
be
resolve
to
discredit
the
wisdom
and
foresight
of
his
aunt
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
could
never
forgive
him
for
this
want
of
reverence
and
respect
.
<EOS>
this
conjecture
be
found
upon
her
behaviour
to
him
in
the
sequel
of
his
infancy
,
during
which
she
be
know
to
torture
him
more
than
once
,
when
she
have
opportunity
of
thrust
pin
into
his
flesh
,
without
any
danger
of
be
detect
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
her
affection
be
in
a
little
time
altogether
alienated
from
this
hope
of
her
family
,
whom
she
abandon
to
the
conduct
of
his
mother
,
whose
province
it
undoubtedly
be
to
manage
the
nature
of
her
own
child
;
while
she
herself
resume
her
operation
upon
the
commodore
,
whom
she
be
resolve
at
any
rate
to
captivate
and
inslave
.
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
own
,
that
Mrs
Grizzle
's
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
never
shine
so
conspicuous
as
in
the
method
she
pursue
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
important
aim
.
    
<EOS>
through
the
rough
unpolished
husk
that
case
the
soul
of
Trunnion
,
she
could
easily
distinguish
a
large
share
of
that
vanity
and
self
-
conceit
that
generally
predominate
even
in
the
most
savage
breast
;
and
to
this
she
constantly
appeal
.
<EOS>
in
his
presence
she
always
exclaim
against
the
craft
and
dishonest
dissimulation
of
the
world
;
and
never
fail
of
utter
particular
invective
against
those
art
of
chicanry
,
in
which
the
lawyer
be
so
conversant
to
the
prejudice
and
ruin
of
their
fellow
creature
:
observe
that
in
a
sea
-
fare
life
,
so
far
as
she
have
opportunity
of
judge
or
be
inform
,
there
be
nothing
but
friendship
,
sincerity
,
and
a
hearty
contempt
for
every
thing
that
be
mean
or
selfish
.
    
<EOS>
this
kind
of
conversation
,
with
the
assistance
of
certain
particular
civility
,
insensibly
make
an
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
commodore
;
and
that
the
more
effectual
,
as
his
former
prepossession
be
build
upon
very
slender
foundation
:
his
antipathy
to
old
maid
,
which
he
have
conceive
upon
hearsay
,
begin
gradually
to
diminish
,
when
he
find
they
be
not
quite
such
infernal
animal
as
they
have
be
represent
;
and
it
be
not
long
before
he
be
hear
to
observe
at
the
club
,
that
Pickle
's
sister
have
not
so
much
of
the
core
of
bitch
in
her
as
he
have
imagine
.
    
<EOS>
this
negative
compliment
,
by
the
medium
of
her
brother
,
soon
reach
the
ear
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
thus
encourage
,
redouble
all
her
art
and
attention
;
so
that
in
less
than
three
month
after
,
he
in
the
same
place
distinguish
her
with
the
epithet
of
a
damned
sensible
jade
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
take
the
alarm
at
this
declaration
,
which
he
fear
forebode
something
fatal
to
his
interest
,
tell
his
commander
with
a
sneer
,
that
she
have
sense
enough
to
bring
him
to
,
under
her
stern
;
and
he
do
not
doubt
but
that
such
an
old
crazy
vessel
would
be
the
well
for
be
take
in
tow
.
"
<EOS>
but
howsomever
,
add
this
arch
adviser
,
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
take
care
of
your
upper
work
;
for
if
once
you
be
make
fast
to
her
poop

agad

<EOS>
she
will
spank
it
away
,
and
make
every
beam
in
your
body
crack
with
straining
.
<EOS>
"
Our
she

projector
's
whole
plan
have
like
to
have
be
ruin
by
the
effect
which
this
malicious
hint
have
upon
Trunnion
,
whose
rage
and
suspicion
be
waken
at
once
,
his
colour
change
from
tawny
to
a
cadaverous
pale
,
and
then
shift
to
a
deep
and
dusky
red
,
such
as
we
sometimes
observe
in
the
sky
when
it
be
replete
with
thunder
,
he
after
his
usual
preamble
of
unmeaning
oath
,
answer
in
these
word
.

Damn

Mrs

conversation

soon
receive
the
unwelcome
news
of
the
commodore
's
aversion
to
matrimony
;
and
justly
impute
the
great
part
of
his
disgust
to
the
satyrical
insinuation
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
resolve
to
level
this
obstruction
to
her
success

actually
find
mean
to

She

on

a

grand
system
of

which
be
adopt
by
the
great
personage
of
the
age

as
fraught

maxim
much
more
effectual
than
all

eloquence
of

Mr

fidelity

his

be
confirm
by
his
foreseeing
in
his
captain

marriage

infinite
fund

cynical
disposition

he
for
the

suppress
all
the
virulence
of
his
wit
against
the

state

as
he

not

his

in
the
positive
praise
of

whatever

take
all
opportunity

astonishment

rally
Jack
in

one
night
toast
her
health

learn
next

interpret
as
the
result
of
his
own
tenderness
for
her
,
she
congratulate
herself
upon
the
victory
she
have

;
and
think
it
unnecessary
to
continue
the
reserve
she

hitherto
industriously

resolve
from
that
day
to
sweeten
her
behaviour
towards
him
with
such
a
dash

as
could

to

him
that

dinner

staid

treat

cloying

<EOS>
this
abrupt
departure

unkind
declaration
affect
Mrs

so
much
,
that
she
fall
sick

mortification

the
part

assure
her
that
her
distemper

and
that
he
would
instantly
send
for
a
physician
,
who
would
convince
her
that
she
be
in
no
manner
of

;
so
that
there
be
no
occasion
at

,
to
employ
any
officious
attorney
in
such
a
melancholy
task

<EOS>
indeed
,
this
affectionate
brother
be
of
opinion
that
a

be
altogether
superfluous
at
any
rate
,
as
he
himself
be
heir
at

to
his

she
insist

obstinacy

Her

do

this
testimony
of

love
,
nevertheless
that

evening
give
an
account

particular
to
Mr

at
the
point
of

and
that
she

this
piece
of
news

with
confusion

and
Mr
Hatchway
impute
his
silence
to
remorse
,
resolve
to
take
advantage
of
that
favourable
moment
,
and
counsel
him
to
go
and
visit
the
poor
young
woman
,
who
be

<EOS>
but
his
admonition
happen
to
be
somewhat
unseasonable
;
for
trunnion
no
sooner
hear
him
mention
the
cause
of
her
disorder
than
his
morosity
recur
,
he
burst
out
into
a
violent
fit
of
cursing
,
and
forthwith
betook
himself
again
to
his
hammock
,
where
he

utter
in
a
low
growl
tone

voice
,
a
repetition

and
imprecation

for

twenty
hour

a

he
put
a

this

place
from
whence
this
solemn
address
seem
to
proceed
,
he
behold
a
glittering
object
that
vanish
in
an
instant
;
and
just
as
his
superstitious
fear
have
improve
the
apparition
into
some
supernatural
messenger
cloathe
in
shine
array
,
his
opinion
be
confirm
by
a
sudden
explosion
,
which
he
take
for
thunder
,
though
it
be
no
other
than
the
noise
of
a
pistol
fire
down
the
chimney
by
the
boatswain
's
mate
,
accord
to
the
instruction
he
have
receive

and
he
have
time
enough
to

before
he

any
danger
of
be
detect
by
his
commander
,
who
could
not

amazement

consternation

He

his
dread
return

double
terror
,
a
cold
sweat
bedew
his
limb

his
knee
knock
together
,
his
hair
bristle
up
,
and
the
remain
of
his
tooth
be
shatter
to
piece
in
the
convulsive
vibration
of
his
jaw
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
agony
he
make
one
desperate
effort
,
and
burst
open
the
door
of
his
apartment
,
bolt
into
Hatchway
's
chamber
,
which
happen
to
be
on
the
same
floor
;
and
there
find
the
lieutenant
in
a
counterfeit
swoon
,
who
pretend
to
wake
from
his
trance
in
an
ejaculation
of
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
<EOS>
and
be
question
by
the
terrify
commodore
with
regard
to
what

,
assure
him
he

the
same
voice

clap
of
thunder
by
which

<EOS>
Pipes
,
whose
turn
it
be
to
watch
,
concur
in
give
evidence
to
the

purpose
;
and
the
commodore
not
only
own
that
he
have
hear
the
voice
,
but
likewise
communicate
his
vision
,
with
all
the
aggravation
which
his
disturb
fancy
suggest

<EOS>
a
consultation
immediately
ensue
,
in
which
Mr
Hatchway
very
gravely
observe
,
that
the
finger
of
God
be
plainly
perceivable
in
those
signal
;
and
that
it
would
be
both
sinful
and
foolish
to
disregard
his
command
,
especially
as
the
match
propose
be
,
in
all
respect
,
more
advantageous
than
any
that

infirmity

reasonably
expect

wipe
the
sweat

remonstrance

this
piece
of
gallantry
he
perform

uncouth

indignant

Mrs

a
disagreeable
dilemma

<EOS>
He
sit
in
an
agony

suspence

as

<EOS>
the

by
an
inconceivable
multitude
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
,
to
give
a
speciman
of
his
gallantry
,
by
the
advice
of
his
friend
Hatchway
,
resolve
to
appear
on
horseback
on
the
grand
occasion
,
at
the
head
of
all
his
male
attendant
,
whom
he
have
rig
with
the
white
shirt
and
black
cap
formerly
belong
to
his
barge
's
crew
;
and
he
buy
a
couple
of
hunter
for
the
accommodation
of
himself
and
his
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
with
this
equipage
then
he
set
out
from
the
garrison
for
the
church
,
after
have
dispatch
a
messenger
to
apprize
the
bride
that
he
and
his
company
be
mount
;
whereupon
she
get
immediately
into
the
coach
,
accompany
by
her
brother
and
his
wife
,
and
drive
directly
to
the
place
of
assignation
,
where
several
pew

and
diver
person
almost
press
to
death
,
by
the
eagerness
of
the
crowd
that
break
in
to
see
the
ceremony
perform
.
    
<EOS>
thus
arrive
at
the
altar
,
and
the
priest
in
attendance
,
they
wait
a
whole
half
hour
for
the
commodore
,
at
whose
slowness
they
begin
to
be
under
some
apprehension
,
and
accordingly
dismiss
a
servant
to
quicken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
the
valet
have
rode
something
more
than
a
mile
,
espy
the
whole
troop
dispose
in
a
long
field
,
cross
the
road
obliquely
,
and
head

who
find
himself
hinder
by
a

farther
in
the
same
direction
,
fire
a
pistol
,
and
stand
over
to
the
other
side
,
make
an
obtuse
angle
with
the
line
of
his
former
course
;
and
the
rest
of
the
squadron
follow
his
example
,
keep
always
in
the
rear
of
each
other
,
like
a
flight
of
wild
goose
.
    
<EOS>
surprize
at
this
strange
method
of
journeying
,
the
messenger
come
up
,
and
tell
the
commodore
that
his
lady
and
her
company
expect
him
in
the
church
,
where
they
have
tarry
a
considerable
time
,
and
be
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
at
his
delay
;
and
therefore
desire
he
would
proceed
with
more
expedition
.
<EOS>
to
this
message
Mr
Trunnion
reply
,
"
Hark
ye
,
brother
,
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
we
make
all
possible
speed
?
<EOS>
go
back
and
tell
those
who
send
you
,
that
the
wind
have
shift
since
we
weigh
anchor
,
and
that
we
be
oblige
to
make
very
short
trip
in
tacking
,
by
reason
of
the
narrowness
of
the
channel
;
and
that
as
we
lie
within
six
point
of
the
wind
,
they
must
make
some
allowance
for
variation
and
leeway
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Sir
!
say
the
valet
<EOS>
,
what
occasion
have
you
to
go
zig
zag
in
that
manner
?
<EOS>
do
but
clap
spur
to
your
horse
,
and
ride
straight
forward
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
engage
you

be
at

in
less
than
a
quarter

<EOS>
answer
the
commander

ahey

<EOS>
brother

where
do
you
learn
your

<EOS>
Hawser
Trunnion
be
not

teach
at
this
time
of

how
to

,
or
keep
his

<EOS>
and
as
for
you
,
brother
,
you
know
good
the
trim
of
your
own
frigate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
courier
find
he
have
to
do
with
people
who
would
not
be
easily
persuade
out
of
their
own
opinion
,
return
to
the
temple
,
and
make
a
report
of
what
he
have
see
and
hear
,
to
the
no
small
consolation
of
the
bride
,
who
have
begin
to
discover
some
sign
of
disquiet
.
<EOS>
compose
,
however
,
by
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
she
exert
her
patience
for
the
space
of
another
half
hour
,
during
which
period
see
no
bridegroom
arrive
,
she
be
exceedingly
alarm
;
so
that
all
the
spectator
could
easily
perceive
her
perturbation
,
which
manifest
itself
in
frequent
palpitation
,
heart
-
heaving
,
and
alteration
of
countenance
,
in
spite
of
the
assistance
of
a
smell
-
bottle
which
she
incessantly
apply
to
her
nostril
.
    
<EOS>
Various
be
the
conjecture
of
the
company
on
this
occasion
:
some
imagine
he
have
mistake
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
as
he
have
never
be
at
church
since
he
first
settle
in
that
parish
;
other
believe
he
have
meet
with
some
accident
,
in
consequence
of
which
his
attendant
have
carry
him
back
to
his
own
house
;
and
a
third
set
,
in
which
the
bride
herself
be
think
to
be
comprehend
,
could
not
help
suspect
that
the
commodore
have
change
his
mind
.
    
<EOS>
but
all
these
supposition
,
ingenious
as
they
be
,
happen
to
be
wide
of
the
true
cause
that
detain
him
,
which
be
no
other
than
this
:
the
commodore
and
his
crew
have
by
dint
of
turning
,
almost
weather
the
parson
's
house
that
stand
to
windward
of
the
church
,
when
the
note
of
a
pack
of
hound
unluckily
reach
the
ear
of
the
two
hunter
which
Trunnion
and
the
lieutenant
bestrode
.
<EOS>
these
fleet
animal
no
sooner
hear
the
enliven
sound
,
than
eager
for
the
chace
they
spring
away
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
strain
every
nerve
to
partake
of
the
sport
,
fly
across
the
field
with
incredible
speed
,
overleap
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
every
thing
in
their
way
,
without
the
least
regard
to
their
unfortunate
rider
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
whose
steed
have
get
the
heel
of
the
other
,
find
it
would
be
great
folly
and
presumption
in
him
to
pretend
to
keep
the
saddle
with
his
wooden
leg
,
very
wisely
take
the
opportunity
of
throw
himself
off
in
his
passage
through
a
field
of
rich
clover
,
among
which
he
lie
at
his
ease
;
and
see
his
captain
advance
at
full
gallop
,
hail
him
with
the
salutation
of
"
what
chear
?
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
commodore
,
who
be
in
infinite
distress
,
eye
him
askance
,
as
he
pass
,
reply
with
a
faultere
voice
,
"
o
damn
ye
!
<EOS>
you
be
safe
at
an
anchor
;
I
wish
to
God
I
be
as
fast
moor
.
"
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
conscious
of
his
disabled
heel
,
he
would
not
venture
to
try
the
same
experiment
which
have
succeed
so
well
with
Hatchway
,
but
resolve
to
stick
as
close
as
possible
to
his
horse
's
back
,
until
providence
should
interpose
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
drop
his
whip
,
and
with
his
right
hand
lay
fast
hold
on
the
pummel
,
contract
every
muscle
in
his
body
to
secure
himself
in
the
seat
,
and
grin
most
formidably
,
in
consequence
of
this
exertion
.
<EOS>
in
this
attitude
he
be
hurry
on
a
considerable
way
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
his
view
be
comfort
by
a
five
bar
gate
that
appear
before
him
,
as
he
never
doubt
that
there
the
career
of
his
hunter
must
necessarily
end
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
reckon
without
his
host
;
far
from
halt
at
this
obstruction
,
the
horse
spring
over
it
with
amazing
agility
,
to
the
utter
confusion
and
disorder
of
his
owner
,
who
lose
his
hat
and
periwig
in
the
leap
,
and
now
begin
to
think
in
good
earnest
,
that
he
be
actually
mount
on
the
back
of
the
devil
.
<EOS>
He
recommend
himself
to
God
,
his
reflection
forsook
him
,
his
eye
-
sight
and
all
his
other
sense
fail
,
he
quit
the
rein
,
and
fasten
by
instinct
on
the
mane
,
be
in
this
condition
convey
into
the
midst
of
the
sportsman
,
who
be
astonish
at
the
sight
of
such
an
apparition
.
<EOS>
neither
be
their
surprize
to
be
wonder
at
,
if
we
reflect
on
the
figure
that
present
itself
to
their
view
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
's
person
be
at
all
time
an
object
of
admiration
;
much
more
so
on
this
occasion
,
when
every
singularity
be
aggravate
by
the
circumstance
of
his
dress
and
disaster
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
put
on
in
honour
of
his
nuptial
his
good
coat
of
blue
broad
cloth
,
cut
by
a
taylor
of
Ramsgate
,
and
trim
with
five
dozen
of
brass
button
,
large
and
small
;
his
breech
be
of
the
same
piece
,
fasten
at
the
knee
with
large
bunche
of
tape
<EOS>
;
his
waistcoat
be
of
red
pluth
lapelle
with
green
velvet
,
and
garnish
with
vellum
hole
;
his
boot
bear
an
intimate
resemblance
both
in
colour
and
shape
to
a
pair
of
leathern
bucket
;
his
shoulder
be
grace
with
a
broad
buff
belt
,
from
whence
depend
a
huge
hanger
with
a
hilt
like
that
of
a
backsword
;
and
on
each
side
of
his
pummel
appear
a
rusty
pistol
ram
in
a
case
cover
with
bear
-
skin
.
    
<EOS>
the
loss
of
his
tye
-
periwig
and
laced
hat
,
which
be
curiosity
of
the
kind
,
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
improvement
of
the
picture
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
by
exhibit
his
bald
pate
,
and
the
natural
extension
of
his
lanthorn
jaw
,
add
to
the
peculiarity
and
extravagance
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
such
a
spectacle
could
not
have
fail
of
divert
the
whole
company
from
the
chace
,
have
his
horse
thought
proper
to
pursue
a
different
route
,
but
the
beast
be
too
keen
a
sporter
to
choose
any
other
way
than
that
which
the
stag
follow
;
and
therefore
,
without
stop
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
spectator
,
he
in
a
few
minute
outstrip
every
hunter
in
the
field
;
and
there
be
a
deep
hollow
way
betwixt
him
and
the
hound
,
rather
than
ride
round
about
the
length
of
a
furlong
to
a
path
that
cross
the
lane
,
he
transport
himself
at
one
jump
,
to
the
unspeakable
astonishment
and
terror
of
a
waggoner
who
chance
to
be
underneath
,
and
see
this
phenomenon
fly
over
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
only
adventure
he
atchieve
.
<EOS>
the
stag
have
take
a
deep
river
that
lie
in
his
way
,
every
man
direct
his
course
to
a
bridge
in
the
neighbourhood
;
but
our
bridegroom
's
courser
despise
all
such
convenience
,
plunge
into
the
stream
without
hesitation
,
and
swam
in
a
twinkling
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
this
sudden
immersion
into
an
element
of
which
trunnion
be
properly
a
native
,
in
all
probability
help
to
recruit
the
exhausted
spirit
of
his
rider
,
who
at
his
landing
on
the
other
side
give
some
token
of
sensation
,
by
hollow
aloud
for
assistance
,
which
he
could
not
possibly
receive
,
because
his
horse
still
maintain
the
advantage
he
have
gain
,
and
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
overtaken
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
after
a
long
chace
that
last
several
hour
,
and
extend
to
a
dozen
mile
at
least
,
he
be
the
first
in
at
the
death
of
the
deer
,
be
second
by
the
lieutenant
's
gelding
,
which
actuate
by
the
same
spirit
,
have
,
without
a
rider
,
follow
his
companion
's
example
.
    
<EOS>
Our
bridegroom
find
himself
at
last
bring
up
,
or
in
other
word
,
at
the
end
of
his
career
,
take
the
opportunity
of
this
first
pause
,
to
desire
the
huntsman
would
lend
him
a
hand
in
dismount
;
and
be
by
their
condescension
safely
place
on
the
grass
,
where
he
sit
stare
at
the
company
as
they
come
in
,
with
such
wildness
of
astonishment
in
his
look
,
as
if
he
have
be
a
creature
of
another
specie
,
dropt
among
them
from
the
cloud
.
    
<EOS>
before
they
have
flesh
the
hound
,
however
,
he
recollect
himself
,
and
see
one
of
the
sportsman
take
a
small
flask
out
of
his
pocket
and
apply
it
to
his
mouth
,
judge
the
cordial
to
be
no
other
than
neat
Coniac
,
which
it
really
be
;
and
express
a
desire
of
participation
,
be
immediately
accommodate
with
a
moderate
dose
,
which
perfectly
compleate
his
recovery
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
time
he
and
his
two
horse
have
engross
the
attention
of
the
whole
crowd
;
while
some
admire
the
elegant
proportion
and
uncommon
spirit
of
the
two
animal
,
the
rest
contemplate
the
surprising
appearance
of
their
master
,
whom
before
they
have
only
see
en
passant
;
and
at
length
,
one
of
the
gentleman
,
accost
him
very
courteously
,
signify
his
wonder
at
see
him
in
such
an
equipage
,
and
ask
if
he
have
not
drop
his
companion
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
ye
,
brother
,
(
reply
the
commodore
)
mayhap
<EOS>
you
think
me
an
odd
sort
of
a
fellow
,
see
me
in
this
trim
,
especially
as
I
have
lose
part
of
my
rigging
;
but
this
here
be
the
case
,
d'ye
see
:
    
I
weigh
anchor
from
my
own
house
this
morning
at
ten
am
with
fair
weather
,
and
a
favourable
breeze
at
south
southeast
,
be
bind
to
the
next
church
,
on
the
voyage
of
matrimony
:
<EOS>
but
howsomever
,
we
have
not
run
down
a
quarter
of
a
league
,
when
the
wind
shifting
,
blow
directly
in
our
tooth
;
so
that
we
be
force
to
tack
all
the
way
,
d'ye
see
,
and
have
almost
beat
up
within
sight
of
port
,
when
these
son
of
bitch
of
horse
,
which
I
have
buy
but
two
day
before
(
for
my
own
part

I
believe
they
be
devil
incarnate
)
<EOS>
luffed
round
in
a
trice
,
and
then
refuse
the
helm
,
drive
away
like
lightne
with
me
and
my
lieutenant
,
who
soon
come
to
anchor
in
an
exceed
good
birth
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
be
carry
over
rock
,
and
flat

and
quicksand
;
among
which
I
have
pitch
away
a
special

<EOS>
the
company
,
who
be
not
at
all
exceptious
,
seem
extremely
well
pleased
with
every
particular

the
entertainment
;
and
the
evening
be
spend
in
the
most
social
manner
,
the
bride
be
by
her
sister
conduct
to
her
apartment
,
where
,
however
,
a
trifle
circumstance
have
like
to
have
destroy
the
harmony
which
have
be
hitherto
maintain
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
,
that
there
be
not
one
stand
bed
within
the
wall
;
therefore
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
Mrs
Trunnion
be
out
of
humour
,
when
she
find
herself
under
the
necessity
of
be
confine
with
her
spouse
in
a
hammock
,
which
tho
'
enlarge
with
a
double
portion
of
canvas
,
and
dilate
with
a
yoke
for
the
occasion
,
be
at
good
but
a
disagreeable
,
not
to
say
dangerous
situation
.
<EOS>
She
accordingly
complain
with
some
warmth
of
this
inconvenience
,
which
she
impute
to
disrespect
,
and
at
first
absolutely
refuse
to
put
up
with
the
expedient
:
but
Mrs
Pickle
soon
bring
her
to
reason
and
compliance
,
by
observe
that
one
night
would
soon
be
elapse
,
and
next
day
she
may
regulate
her
own
oeconomy
.
    
<EOS>
thus
persuade
,
she
venture
into
the
vehicle
,
and
be
visit
by
her
husband
in
less
than
an
hour
,
the
company
be
depart
to
their
own
home
,
and
the
garrison
leave
to
the
command
of
his
lieutenant
and
mate
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
the
hook
that
support
this
swinging
couch
be
not
calculate
for
the
addition
of
weight
which
they
be
now
destine
to
bear
;
and
therefore
give
way
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
to
the
no
small
terror
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
perceive
herself
fall
,
scream
aloud
,
and
by
that
exclamation
bring
Hatchway
with
a
light
into
the
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
she
have
receive
no
injury
by
the
fall
she
be
extremely
discompose
and
incense
at
the
accident
,
which
she
even
openly
ascribe
to
the
obstinacy
and
whimsical
oddity
of
the
commodore
,
in
such
petulant
term
as
evidently
declare
that
she
think
her
great
aim
accomplish
,
and
her
authority
secure
against
all
the
shock
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
indeed
her
bedfellow
seem
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
by
his
tacit
resignation
;
for
he
make
no
reply
to
her
insinuation
,
but
with
a
most
vinegar
aspect
crawl
out
of
his
nest
,
and
betook
himself
to
rest
in
another
apartment
,
while
his
irritated
spouse
dismiss
the
lieutenant
,
and
from
the
wreck
of
the
hammock
make
an
occasional
bed
for
herself
on
the
floor
,
fully
determined
to
provide
well
accommodation
for
next
night
's
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
have
no
inclination
to
sleep
,
her
thought
during
the
remain
part
of
the
night
be
engross
by
a
scheme
of
reformation
she
be
resolve
to
execute
in
the
family
;
and
no
sooner
do
the
first
lark
bid
salutation
to
the
morn
,
than
start
from
her
humble
couch
,
and
huddle
on
her
cloath
,
she
sally
from
her
chamber
,
explore
her
way
thro
'
path
before
unknown
,
and
in
the
course
of
her
research
perceive
a
large
bell
,
to
which
she
make
such
effectual
application
as
alarm
every
soul
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
she
be
surround
by
Hatchway
,
Pipes
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
servant
half
dress
;
but
see
none
of
the
feminine
gender
appear
,
she
begin
to
storm
at
the
sloth
and
laziness
of
the
maid
,
who
,
she
observe
,
ought
to
have
be
at
work
an
hour
at
least
before
she
call
;
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
understand
that
no
woman
be
permit
to
sleep
within
the
wall
.
    
<EOS>
She
do
not
fail
to
exclaim
against
this
regulation
;
and
be
inform
that
the
cook
and
chambermaid
lodge
in
a
small
office
-
house
that
stand
without
the
gate
,
order
the
draw
-
bridge
to
be
let
down
,
and
in
person
beat
up
their
quarter
,
command
them
forthwith
to
set
about
scour
the
room
,
which
have
not
be
hitherto
keep
in
a
very
decent
condition
,
while
two
man
be
immediately
employ
to
transport
the
bed
on
which
she
use
to
lie
from
her
brother
's
house
to
her
new
habitation
;
so
that
,
in
less
than
two
hour
,
the
whole
oeconomy
of
the
garrison
be
turn
topsy
-
turvy
,
and
every
thing
involve
in
such
tumult
and
noise
,
that
trunnion
be
disturb
and
distract
with
the
uproar
,
turn
out
in
his
shirt
like
a
frantic
maniac
,
and
arm
himself
with
a
cudgel
of
crab
-
tree
,
make
an
irruption
into
his
wife
's
apartment
,
where
perceive
a
couple
of
carpenter
at
work
,
in
join
a
bedstead
,
he
,
with
many
dreadful
oath
and
opprobrious
invective
,
order
them
to
desist
,
swear
he
would
suffer
no
bulk
-
head
nor
hurricane
-
house
to
stand
where
he
be
master
:
but
find
his
remonstrance
disregard
by
these
mechanic
,
who
believe
him
to
be
some
madman
belong
to
the
family
,
who
have
break
from
his
confinement
,
he
assault
them
both
with
great
fury
and
indignation
,
and
be
handle
so
roughly
in
the
encounter
,
that
in
a
very
short
time
he
measure
his
length
on
the
floor
,
in
consequence
of
a
blow
that
he
receive
from
a
hammer
,
by
which
the
sight
of
his
remain
eye
be
grievously
endanger
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
reduce
him
to
a
state
of
subjection
,
they
resolve
to
secure
him
with
cord
,
and
be
actually
busy
in
adjust
his
fetter
,
when
he
be
exempt
from
the
disgrace
by
the
accidental
entrance
of
his
spouse
,
who
rescue
him
from
the
hand
of
his
adversary
,
and
,
in
the
midst
of
her
condolance
,
impute
his
misfortune
to
the
inconsiderate
roughness
of
his
own
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
He
breathe
nothing
but
revenge
,
and
make
some
effort
to
chastise
the
insolence
of
the
workman
,
who
,
as
soon
as
they
understand
his
quality
,
ask
forgiveness
for
what
they
have
do
with
great
humility
,
protest
that
they
do
not
know
he
be
master
of
the
house

but
,
far
from
be
satisfied
with
this
apology
,
he

about
for
the
bell

His

evil

exasperate
at
the
insult
he
have
suffer
,
which
they
consider
as
an
affront
upon
the
dignity
of
the
garrison
;
the
more
so
,
as
the
mutineer
seem
to
put
themselves
in
a
posture
of
defence
,
and
set
their
authority
at
defiance
:
they
therefore
unsheathe
their
cutlass
,
which
they
commonly
wear
as
badge
of
their
commission
;
and
a
desperate
engagement
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
ensue
,
have
not
the
lady
of
the
castle
interpose
,
and
prevent
the
effect
of
their
animosity
,
by
assure
the
lieutenant
that
the
commodore
have
be
the
aggressor
;

that
the

themselves
attack
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner

by

<EOS>
Mr
Hatchway
no
sooner
learn
the
sentiment
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
than
sheathe
his
indignation
,
he
tell
the
commodore
he
should
always
be
ready
to
execute
his
lawful
command
;
but
that
he
could
not
in
conscience
be
concern
in
oppress
poor
people
who
have
be
guilty
of
no
offence
.
    
<EOS>
this
unexpected
declaration
,
together
with
the
behaviour
of
his
wife
,
who
in
his
hearing
desire
the
carpenter
to
resume
their
work
,
fill
the
breast
of
trunnion
with
rage
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
He
pull
off
his
woollen
night
-
cap
,
pummel
his
bare
pate
,
beat
the
floor
alternately
with
his
foot
,
swear
his
people
have
betray
him
,
and
curse
himself
to
the
low
pit
of
hell
,
for
have
admit
such
a
cockatrice
into
his
family
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
exclamation
do
not
avail
;
they
be
among
the
last
essay
of
his
resistance
to
the
will
of
his
wife
,
whose
influence
among
his
adherent
have
already
swallow
up
his
own
;
and
who
now
peremptorily
tell
him
,
that
he
must
leave
the
management
of
every
thing
within
door
to
her
,
who
understand
best
what

She

to

of

growl

while
his

fellow
execute
every
circumstance
of

when

Chapter
X
<EOS>
the
commodore
be
in
some
case
restif
,
his
lady
have
recourse
to
artifice
in
the
establishment
of
her
throne
;
she
exhibit
symptom
of
pregnancy
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
Trunnion
,
who
nevertheless
be
baulk
in
his
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
these
innovation
be
not
effect
without
many
loud
objection
on
his
part
;
and
diver
curious
dialogue
pass
between
him
and
his
yoke
-
fellow
,
who
always
come
off
victorious
from
the
dispute
;
insomuch
that
his
countenance
gradually
fall
;
he
begin
to
suppress
,
and
at
length
intirely
devour
his
chagrin
;
the
terror
of
superior
authority
be
plainly
perceivable
in
his
feature
,
and
in
less
than
three
month
he
become
a
thorough
-
pace
husband
.
<EOS>
not
that
his
obstinacy
be
extinguish
,
tho
'
overcome
;
in
some
thing
he
be
as
inflexible
and
muleish
as
ever
,
but
then
he
durst
not
kick
so
openly
,
and
be
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
be
passive
in
his
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
,
for
example
,
propose
that
a
coach
and
six
should
be
purchase
,
as
she
could
not
ride
on
horseback
,
and
the
chaise
be
a
scandalous
carriage
for
a
person
of
her
condition
;
the
commodore
,
conscious
of
his
own
inferior
capacity
in
point
of
reasoning
,
do
not
think
proper
to
dispute
the
proposal
,
but
lend
a
deaf
ear
to
her
repeat
remonstrance
,
tho
'
they
be
inforce
with
every
argument
which
she
think
could
sooth
,
terrify
,
shame
or
decoy
him
into
compliance
:
in
vain
do
she
urge
the
excess
of
affection
she
have
for
him
,
as
merit
some
return
of
tenderness
and
condescension
;
he
be
even
proof
against
certain
menacing
hint
she
give
,
touch
the
resentment
of
a
slight
woman
;
and
he
stand
out
against
all
the
consideration
of
dignity
or
disgrace
,
like
a
bulwark
of
brass
.
<EOS>
neither
be
he
move
to
any
indecent
or
unkind
expression
of
contradiction
,
even
when
she
upbraid
him
with
his
sordid
disposition
,
and
put
him
in
mind
of
the
fortune
and
honour
he
have
acquire
by
his
marriage
,
but
seem
to
retire
within
himself
,
like
a
tortoise
when
attack
,
that
shrink
within
its
shell
,
and
silently
endure
the
scourge
of
her
reproach
,
without
seem
sensible
of
the
smart
.
    
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
the
only
point
in
which
she
have
be
baffle
since
her
nuptial
;
and
as
she
could
by
no
means
digest
the
miscarriage
,
she
torture
her
invention
for
some
new
plan
by
which
she
may
augment
her
influence
and
authority
:
what
her
genius
refuse
be
supply
by
accident
;
for
she
have
not
live
four
month
in
the
garrison
when
she
be
seize
with
frequent
qualm
and
reaching
,
her
breast
begin
to
harden
,
and
her
stomach
to
be
remarkably
prominent
:
in
a
word
,
she
congratulate
herself
on
the
symptom
of
her
own
fertility
,
and
the
commodore
be
transport
with
joy
,
at
the
prospect
of
an
heir
of
his
own
begetting
.
    
<EOS>
She
know
this
be
the
proper
season
for
vindicate
her
own
sovereignty
,
and
accordingly
employ
the
mean
which
nature
have
put
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
rare
piece
of
furniture
and
apparel
for
which
she
do
not
long
;
and
one
day
as
she
go
to
church
,
see
lady
Stately
's
equipage
arrive
,
she
suddenly
faint
away
.
    
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
whose
vanity
have
never
be
so
perfectly
gratify
as
with
this
promise
harvest
of
his
own
sowing
,
take
the
alarm
immediately
,
and
in
order
to
prevent
relapse
of
that
kind
,
which
may
be
attend
with
fatal
consequence
to
his
hope
,
give
her
leave
to
bespeak
a
coach
,
horse
and
livery
to
her
own
liking
.
<EOS>
thus
authorize
,
she
in
a
very
little
time
exhibit
such
a
speciman
of
her
own
taste
and
magnificence
as
afford
speculation
to
the
whole
county
,
and
make
trunnion
's
heart
quake
within
him
,
because
he
foresee
no
limit
to
her
extravagance
,
which
also
manifest
itself
in
the
most
expensive
preparation
for
her
lie
in
.
    
<EOS>
Her
pride
,
which
have
hitherto
regard
the
representative
of
her
father
's
house
,
seem
now
to
lose
all
that
hereditary
respect
,
and
prompt
her
to
outshine
and
undervalue
the
elder
branch
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
She
behave
to
Mrs
Pickle
with
a
sort
of
civil
reserve
that
imply
a
conscious
superiority
,
and
an
emulation
in
point
of
grandeur
immediately
commence
between
the
two
sister
.
<EOS>
She
every
day
communicate
her
importance
to
the
whole
parish
,
under
pretence
of
take
the
air
in
her
coach
,
and
endeavour
to
extend
her
acquaintance
among
people
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
an
undertaking
attend
with
great
difficulty
,
for
all
person
whatever
,
capable
of
maintain
a
certain
appearance
,
will
always
find
admission
into
what
be
call
the
good
company
,
and
be
rate
in
point
of
character
accord
to
their
own
valuation
,
without
subject
their
pretension
to
the
small
doubt
or
examination
.
    
<EOS>
in
all
her
visit
and
party
she
seize
every
opportunity
of
declare
her
present
condition
,
observe
that
she
be
forbid
by
her
physician
to
taste
such
a
pickle
,
and
that
such
a
dish
be
poison
to
a
woman
in
her
way
:
<EOS>
nay
,
where
she
be
on
a
footing
of
familiarity
,
she
affect
to
make
wry
face
,
and
complain
that
the
young
rogue
begin
to
be
very
unruly
,
writhe
herself
into
diver
contortion
,
as
if
she
have
be
grievously
incommode
by
the
mettle
of
this
future
Trunnion
.
<EOS>
the
husband
himself
do
not
behave
with
all
the
moderation
that
may
have
be
expect
;
at
the
club
he
frequently
mention'd
<EOS>
this
circumstance
of
his
own
vigour
as
a
pretty
successful
feat
to
be
perform
by
an
old
fellow
of
fifty
-
five
,
and
confirm
the
opinion
of
his
strength
by
redouble
squeeze
of
the
landlord
's
hand
,
which
never
fail
of
extort
a
satisfactory
certificate
of
his
might
.
<EOS>
when
his
companion
drink
to
the
Hans
en
kelderr
,
or
Jack
in
the
low
cellar
,
he
could
not
help
display
an
extraordinary
complacence
of
countenance
,
and
signify
his
intention
of
send
the
young
dog
to
sea
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
able
to
carry
a
cartridge
,
in
hope
of
see
him
an
officer
before
his
own
death
.
    
<EOS>
this
hope
help
to
console
him
under
the
extraordinary
expence
to
which
he
be
expose
by
the
profusion
of
his
wife
,
especially
when
he
consider
that
his
compliance
with
her
prodigality
would
be
limit
to
the
expiration
of
the
nine
month
,
of
which
the
good
part
be
by
this
time
elapse
;
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
philosophical
resignation
,
her
fancy
sometimes
soar
to
such
a
ridiculous
and
intolerable
pitch
of
insolence
and
absurdity
,
that
his
temper
forsook
him
,
and
he
could
not
help
wish
in
secret
,
that
her
pride
may
be
confound
in
the
dissipation
of
her
most
flattering
hope
,
even
tho
<EOS>
'
he
himself
should
be
a
principal
sufferer
by
the
disappointment
.
    
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
no
other
than
the
suggestion
of
temporary
disgust
,
that
commonly
subside
as
suddenly
as
they
arise
,
and
never
give
the
least
disturbance
to
the
person
who
inspire
them
,
because
he
take
care
to
conceal
them
carefully
from
her
knowledge
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
she
happily
advance
in
her
reckoning
,
with
the
promise
of
a
favourable
issue
;
the
term
of
her
computation
expire
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
be
visit
by
certain
warning
that
seem
to
bespeak
the
approach
of
the
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
get
up
with
great
alacrity
,
and
call
the
midwife
,
who
have
be
several
day
in
the
house
;
the
gossip
be
immediately
summon
,
and
the
most
interesting
expectation
prevail
;
but
the
symptom
of
labour
gradually
vanish
,
and
,
as
the
matron
sagely
observe
,
this
be
no
more
than
a
false
alarm
.
    
<EOS>
two
night
after
they
receive
a
second
intimation
,
and
as
she
be
sensibly
diminish
in
the
waist
,
every
thing
be
suppose
to
be
in
a
fair
way
;
yet
this
visitation
be
not
more
conclusive
than
the
former
;
her
pain
wear
off
in
spite
of
all
her
endeavour
to
encourage
them
,
and
the
good
woman
betook
themselves
to
their
respective
home
,
in
expectation
of
find
the
third
attack
decisive
,
allude
to
the
well
-
know
maxim
,
that
number
three
be
always
fortunate
.
<EOS>
for
once
,
however
,
this
apothegm
fail
;
the
next
call
be
altogether
as
ineffectual
as
the
former
;
and
moreover
,
attend
with
a
phaenomenon
which
to
them
be
equally
strange
and
inexplicable
:
this
be
no
other
than
such
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
Mrs
Trunnion
as
may
have
be
expect
after
the
birth
of
a
full
-
grown
child
.
    
<EOS>
Startled
at
such
an
unaccountable
event
,
they
sit
in
close
divan
;
and
conclude
that
the
case
be
in
all
respect
unnatural
and
prodigious
,
desire
that
a
messenger
may
be
immediately
dispatch
for
some
male
practitioner
in
the
art
of
midwifery
.
    
<EOS>
the
commodore
,
without
guess
the
cause
of
their
perplexity
,
order
Pipes
immediately
on
this
piece
of
duty
;
and
in
less
than
two
hour
they
be
assist
by
the
advice
of
a
surgeon
of
the
neighbourhood
,
who
boldly
affirm
that
the
patient
have
never
be
with
child
.
<EOS>
this
asseveration
be
like
a
clap
of
thunder
to
Mr
Trunnion
,
who
have
be
during
eight
whole
day
and
night
in
continual
expectation
of
be
hail
with
the
appellation
of
father
.
    
<EOS>
after
some
recollection
he
swear
the
surgeon
be
an
ignorant
fellow
,
and
that
he
would
not
take
his
word
for
what
he
advance
,
be
comfort
and
confirm
in
his
want
of
faith
by
the
insinuation
of
the
midwife
,
who
still
persist
to
feed
Mrs
Trunnion
with
hope
of
a
speedy
and
safe
delivery
;
observe
that
she
have
be
concern
in
many
a
case
of
the
same
nature
,
where
a
fine
child
be
find
,
even
after
all
sign
of
the
mother
's
pregnancy
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
every
twig
of
hope
,
how
slender
soever
it
may
be
,
be
eagerly
catch
hold
on
by
people
who
find
themselves
in
danger
of
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
to
every
question
propose
by
her
to
the
lady
with
the
preamble
of
"
han't
you
?
"
or
"
do
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
an
answer
be
make
in
the
affirmative
,
whether
agreeable
to
truth
or
not
,
because
the
respondent
could
not
find
in
her
heart
to
disown
any
symptom
that
may
favour
the
notion
she
have
so
long
indulge
.
    
<EOS>
this
experienced
proficient
in
the
obstetric
art
be
therefore
keep
in
close
attendance
for
the
space
of
three
week
,
during
which
the
patient
have
several
return
of
what
she
please
herself
with
believe
to
be
labour
-
pain
,
till
at
length
she
and
her
husband
become
the
stand
joke
of
the
parish
;
and
this
infatuate
couple
could
scarce
be
prevail
upon
to
part
with
their
hope
,
even
when
she
appear
as
lank
as
a
greyhound
,
and
they
be
furnish
with
other
unquestionable
proof
of
their
have
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
for
ever
remain
under
the
influence
of
this
sweet
delusion
,
which
at
last
fade
away
,
and
be
succeed
by
a
paroxism
of
shame
and
confusion
,
that
keep
the
husband
within
door
for
the
space
of
a
whole
fortnight
,
and
confine
his
lady
to
her
bed
for
a
series
of
week
,
during
which
she
suffer
all
the
anguish
of
the
most
intense
mortification
;
yet
even
this
be
subdue
by
the
lenient
hand
of
time
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
respite
from
her
chagrin
be
employ
in
the
strict
discharge
of
what
be
call
the
duty
of
religion
,
which
she
perform
with
the
most

chapter
XI
Mrs
Trunnion
erect
a
tyranny
in
the
garrison
,
while
her
husband
conceive
an
affection
for
his
nephew
Perry
,
who
manifest
a
peculiarity
of
disposition
even
in
his
tender
year
.
   
<EOS>
have
exercise
herself
three
month
in
such
pious
amusement
,
she
appear
again
in
the
world
;
but
her
misfortune
have
make
such
an
impression
on
her
mind
,
that
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
child
,
and
tremble
whenever
the
conversation
happen
to
turn
upon
a
christening
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
,
which
be
naturally
none
of
the
sweetest
,
seem
to
have
imbibe
a
double
proportion
of
souring
from
her
disappointment
;
of
consequence
her
company
be
not
much
coveted
,
and
she
find
very
few
people
dispose
to
treat
her
with
those
mark
of
consideration
which
she
look
upon
as
her
due
.
<EOS>
this
neglect
detach
her
from
the
society
of
an
unmannerly
world
;
she
concentre
the
energy
of
all
her
talent
in
the
government
of
her
own
house
,
which
groan
accordingly
under
her
arbitrary
sway
,
and
<EOS>
in
the
brandy
-
bottle
find
ample
consolation
for
all
the
affliction
she
have
undergo
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
commodore
,
he
in
a
little
time
weather
his
disgrace
,
after
have
sustain
many
severe
joke
from
the
lieutenant
;
and
now
his
chief
aim
be
to
be
absent
from
his
own
house
as
much
as
possible
,
he
frequent
the
publick
-
house
more
than
ever
,
more
assiduously
cultivate
the
friendship
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
Mr
Pickle
,
and
in
the
course
of
their
intimacy
conceive
an
affection
for
his
nephew
Perry
,
which
do
not
end
but
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
must
be
own
that
trunnion
be
not
naturally
deficient
in
the
social
passion
of
the
soul
,
which
,
tho
'
they
be
strangely
warped
,
disguise
and
overbear
by
the
circumstance
of
his
boisterous
life
and
education
,
do
not
fail
to
manifest
themselves
occasionally
thro
'
the
whole
course
of
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
as
all
his
hope
of
propagate
his
own
name
have
perish
,
and
his
relation
lie
under
the
interdiction
of
his
hate
,
it
be
no
wonder
that
thro
'
the
familiarity
and
friendly
intercourse
subsist
between
him
and
Mr
Gamaliel
,
he
contract
a
liking
for
the
boy
,
who
by
this
time
enter
the
third
year
of
his
age
,
and
be
indeed
a
very
handsome
,
healthy
and
promising
child
;
and
what
seem
to
ingratiate
him
still
more
with
his
uncle
,
be
a
certain
oddity
of
disposition
for
which
he
have
be
remarkable
even
from
his
cradle
.
<EOS>
It
be
report
of
him
,
that
before
the
first
year
of
his
infancy
be
elapse
,
he
use
very
often
,
immediately
after
be
dress
,
in
the
midst
of
the
caress
which
be
bestow
upon
him
by
his
mother
while
she
indulge
herself
in
the
contemplation
of
her
own
happiness
,
all
of
a
sudden
to
alarm
her
with
a
fit
of
shriek
and
cry
,
which
continue
with
great
violence
till
he
be
strip
to
the
skin
with
the
utmost
expedition
by
order
of
his
affright
parent
,
who
think
his
tender
body
be
torture
by
the
misapplication
of
some
unlucky
pin
;
and
when
he
have
give
them
all
this
disturbance
and
unnecessary
trouble
,
he
would
lie
sprawl
and
laugh
in
their
face
,
as
if
he
ridicule
the
impertinence
of
their
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
<EOS>
it
be
affirm
,
that
one
day
,
when
an
old
woman
who
attend
in
the
nursery
have
by
stealth
convey
a
bottle
of
cordial
water
to
her
mouth
,
he
pull
his
nurse
by
the
sleeve
,
and
by
a
slight
glance
detect
the
theft
,
tipt
her
the
wink
with
a
particular
slyness
of
countenance
,
as
if
he
have
say
with
a
sneer
,
"
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
that
be
what
you
must
all
come
to
.
"
<EOS>
but
these
instance
of
reflection
in
a
babe
nine
month
old
be
so
incredible
,
that
I
look
upon
them
as
ex
post
facto
observation
,
found
upon
imaginary
recollection
,
when
he
be
in
a
more
advanced
age
,
and
his
peculiarity
of
temper
become
much
more
remarkable
:
of
a
piece
with
the
ingenious
discovery
of
those
sagacious
observer
,
who
can
discern
something
evidently
characteristic
in
the
feature
of
any
note
personage
whose
character
they
have
previously
hear
explain
;
yet
,
without
pretend
to
specify
at
what
period
of
his
childhood
this
singularity
first
appear
,
<EOS>
I
can
with
great
truth
declare
,
that
when
he
first
attract
the
notice
and
affection
of
his
uncle
,
it
be
plainly
perceivable
.
    
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
he
have
mark
out
the
commodore
as
a
proper
object
of
ridicule
,
for
almost
all
his
little
childish
satire
be
level
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
that
he
may
have
be
influence
in
this
particular
by
the
example
and
instruction
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
delight
in
superintend
the
first
essay
of
his
genius
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
gout
have
take
up
its
residence
in
Mr
Trunnion
's
great
toe
,
from
whence
it
never
remove
,
no
not
for
a
day
,
little
Perry
take
great
pleasure
in
tread
by
accident
on
this
infirm
member
;
and
when
his
uncle
,
incense
by
the
pain
,
use
to
damn
him
for
a
hell
-
begotten
brat
,
he
would
appease
him
in
a
twinkling
by
return
the
curse
with
equal
emphasis
,
and
ask
what
be
the
matter
with
old
Hannibal
Tough
?
<EOS>
an
appellation
by
which
the
lieutenant
have
teach
him
to
distinguish
this
grim
commander
.
    
<EOS>
neither
be
this
the
only
experiment
he
try
upon
the
patience
of
the
commodore
,
with
whose
nose
he
use
to
take
indecent
freedom
even
while
he
be
fondle
on
his
knee
;
in
one
month
he
put
him
to
the
expence
of
two
guinea
in
seal
-
skin
,
by
pick
his
pocket
of
diver
tobacco
pouch
,
all
of
which
he
in
secret
committed
to
the
flame
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
caprice
of
his
disposition
abstain
from
the
favourite
beverage
of
trunnion
,
who
more
than
once
swallow
a
whole
draught
in
which
his
brother
's
snuff
-
box
have
be
empty
,
before
he
perceive
the
disagreeable
infusion
:
and
one
day
,
<EOS>
when
the
commodore
have
chastise
him
by
a
gentle
tap
with
his
cane
,
he
fall
flat
on
the
floor
as
if
he
have
be
deprive
of
all
sense
and
motion
,
to
the
terror
and
amazement
of
the
striker
;
and
after
have
fill
the
whole
house
with
confusion
and
dismay
,
open
his
eye
and
laugh
heartily
at
the
success
of
his
own
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
endless
and
perhaps
no
very
agreeable
task
,
to
enumerate
all
the
unlucky
prank
he
play
upon
his
uncle
and
other
,
before
he
attain
the
fourth
year
of
his
age
;
about
which
time
he
be
send
,
with
an
attendant
,
to
a
day
-
school
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
(
to
use
his
good
mother
's
own
expression
)
<EOS>
he
may
be
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
he
make
little
progress
,
except
in
mischief
,
which
he
practise
with
impunity
,
because
the
school
-
mistress
would
run
no
risk
of
disoblige
a
lady
of
fortune
,
by
exercise
unnecessary
severity
upon
her
only
child
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
Mrs
Pickle
be
not
so
blindly
partial
as
to
be
pleased
with
such
unseasonable
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Perry
be
take
out
of
the
hand
of
this
courteous
teacher
,
and
commit
to
the
instruction
of
a
pedagogue
,
who
be
order
to
administer
such
correction
as
the
boy
should
in
his
opinion
deserve
.
<EOS>
this
authority
he
do
not
neglect
to
use
;
his
pupil
be
regularly
flog
twice
a
day
,
and
after
have
be
subject
to
this
course
of
discipline
for
the
space
of
eighteen
month
,
declare
the
most
obstinate
,
dull
and
untoward
genius
that
ever
have
fall
under
his
cultivation
;
instead
of
be
reform
,
he
seem
rather
harden
and
confirm
in
his
vicious
inclination
,
and
be
dead
to
all
sense
of
fear
as
well
as
shame
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
extremely
mortify
at
these
symptom
of
stupidity
,
which
she
consider
as
an
inheritance
derive
from
the
spirit
of
his
father
,
and
consequently
insurmountable
by
all
the
effort
of
human
care
.
<EOS>
but
the
commodore
rejoice
over
the
ruggedness
of
his
nature
,
and
be
particularly
pleased
when
upon
inquiry
he
find
that
Perry
have
beat
all
the
boy
in
the
school
;
a
circumstance
from
which
he
prognosticate
every
thing
that
be
fair
and
fortunate
in
his
future
fate
;
observe
,
that
at
his
age
he
himself
be
just
such
another
.
<EOS>
the
boy
,
who
be
now
turn
of
six
,
have
profit
so
little
under
the
birch
of
his
unspare
governor
,
Mrs
Pickle
be
counsel
to
send
him
to
a
boarding
-
school
not
far
from
London
,
which
be
keep
by
a
certain
person
very
eminent
for
his
successful
method
of
education
.
<EOS>
this
advice
she
the
more
readily
embrace
,
because
at
that
time
she
find
herself
pretty
far
go
with
another
child
,
that
she
hope
would
console
her
for
the
disappointment
she
have
meet
with
in
the
unpromising
talent
of
Perry
,
or
at
any
rate
divide
her
concern
,
so
as
to
enable
her
to
endure
the
absence
of
either
.

to
make

objection

so
much

nothing
could
be
better
judge
than
this
piece
of
liberality
;
the
assistant
be
actually
a
man
of
learning

probity
,
and
good
sense
;
and
though
oblige
by
the
scandalous

of
fortune
to
act
in
the
character
of
an
inferior
teacher

have
by
his

bring
the

to
that
degree
of
reputation
which

examine

his

in
order
to
consult
the
biass
of

which
be
strangely
pervert
by
the
absurd
discipline
he
have

<EOS>
He
find
him
in
a
state
of
sullen
insensibility
,
which
the
child
have
gradually
contract
in
a
long
course
of
stupifye
correction
;
and
at
first
he
be
not
in
the
least
actuate
by
that
commendation
which
animate
the
rest
of
his
school

fellow
;
nor
be
it
in

power
of
reproach
to
excite
his
ambition
,
which
have
be
bury
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
grave
of
disgrace
:
the

therefore
have
recourse
to
contemptuous
neglect
,
with
which
he
affect
to
treat
this
stubborn
spirit
;
foresee
that
if
he
retain
any
seed
of
sentiment
,
this
weather
would
infallibly
raise
them
into
vegetation
:
his
judgment
be
justify
by
the
event
;
the
boy
in
a
little
time
begin
to
make
observation
;
he
perceive
the
mark
of
distinction
with
which
virtue
be
reward
,
grow
ashamed
of
the
despicable
figure
he
himself
make
amongst
his
companion
,
who
far
from
court
,
rather
shun
his
conversation
;
and
actually
pine
at
his
own
want
of
importance
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jennings
see
and
rejoice
at
his
mortification
,
which
he
suffer
to
proceed
as
far
as
possible
,
without
endanger
his
health

<EOS>
the
child
lose
all
relish
for
diversion
,
loathe
his
food
,
grow
pensive
,
solitary
,
and
be
frequently
find
weep
by

<EOS>
these
symptom
plainly
evince
the
recovery
of
his
feeling
,
to
which
his
governor
think
it
now
high
time
to
make
application
;
and
therefore
by
little
and
little
alter
his
behaviour
from
the
indifference
he
have
put
on
,
to
the
appearance
of
more
regard

<EOS>
this
produce
a

change

I

<EOS>
such
encomium
kindle
the
spirit
of

in

he
exert
himself
with

alacrity
,
by

he
soon
acquit
himself
of
the
imputation
of
dullness
,
and
obtain
sundry
honorary
silver

,
as
acknowledgement
of

application

his

sollicite
his

as
eagerly
as
they
have
avoid
it
before

than
a
twelvemonth
after

these
commendation
the
truth
be
always
exaggerate
by
school
-
master
,
for
their
own
interest
;
and
pretend
to
wonder
that
the
usher
have
not
mingle
more
probability
with
his
praise
.
<EOS>
trunnion
be
offend
at
her
indifference
and
want
of
faith
,
and
believe
that
she
refine
too
much
in
her
discernment
,
swear
that
Jennings
have
declare
the
truth
,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
;
for
he
himself
have
prophecie
from
the
beginning
,
that
the
boy
would
turn
out
a
credit
to
his
family
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
Mrs
Pickle
be
bless
with
a
daughter
,
whom
she
have
bring
into
the
world
about
six
month
before
the
intelligence
arrive
;
so
that
her
care
and
affection
be
otherwise
engross
,
<EOS>
the
praise
of
Perry
be
the
less
greedily
devour
.
<EOS>
the
abatement
of
her
fondness
be
an
advantage
to
his
education
,
which
would
have
be
retard
,
and
perhaps
ruin
by
pernicious
indulgence
and
preposterous
interposition
,
have
her
love
consider
him
as
an
only
child
;
whereas
her
concern
be
now
divert
to
another
object
that
share
,
at
least
,
one
half
of
her
affection
,
he
be
leave
to
the
management
of
his
preceptor
,
who
tutor
him
accord
to
his
own
plan
,
without
any
lett
or
interruption
.
<EOS>
indeed
all
his
sagacity
and
circumspection
be
but
barely
sufficient
to
keep
the
young
gentleman
in
order
;
for
now
that
he
have
win
the
palm
of
victory
from
his
rival
in
point
of
scholarship
,
his
ambition
dilate
,
and
he
be
seize
with
the
desire
of
subject
the
whole
school
by
the
valour
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
before
he
could
bring
this
project
to
bear
,
innumerable
battle
be
fight
with
various
success
;
every
day
a
bloody
nose
and
complaint
be
present
against
him
,
and
his
own
visage
commonly
bear
some
livid
mark
of
obstinate
contention
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
accomplish
his
aim
;
his
adversary
be
subdue
,
his
prowess
acknowledge
,
and
he
obtain
the
laurel
in
war
as
well
as
wit
.
<EOS>
thus
triumphant
,
he
be
intoxicate
with
success
.
<EOS>
His
pride
rise
in
proportion
to
his
power
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
endeavour
of
Jennings
,
who
practise
every
method
he
could
invent
for
curb
his
licentious
conduct
,
without
depress
his
spirit
,
he
contract
a
large
proportion
of
insolence
,
which
a
series
of
misfortune
that
happen
to
him
in
the
sequel
could
scarce
effectually
tame
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
there
be
a
fund
of
good
nature
and
generosity
in
his
composition
;
and
though
he
establish
a
tyranny
among
his
comrade
,
the
tranquillity
of
his
reign
be
maintain
by
the
love
rather
than
by
the
fear
of
his
subject
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
enjoyment
of
empire
,
he
never
once
violate
that
respectful
awe
with
which
the
usher
have
find
mean
to
inspire
him
;
but
he
by
no
means
preserve
the
same
regard
for
the
principal
master
,
an
old
illiterate
german
quack
,
who
have
formerly
practise
corn
-
cutting
among
the
quality
,
and
sell
cosmetic
wash
to
the
lady
,
together
with
tooth
-
powder
,
hair
-
die
liquor
,
prolifick
elixir
,
and
tincture
to
sweeten
the
breath
.
<EOS>
these
nostrum
,
recommend
by
the
art
of
cringing
,
in
which
he
be
consummate
,
ingratiate
him
so
much
with
people
of
fashion
,
that
he
be
enable
to
set
up
-
school
with
five
and
twenty
boy
of
the
good
family
,
whom
he
board
on
his
own
term
,
and
undertake
to
instruct
in
the
french
and
latin
language
,
so
as
to
qualify
them
for
the
college
of
Westminster
or
Eaton
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
plan
be
in
its
infancy
,
he
be
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
with
Jennings
,
who
for
the
paultry
consideration
of
thirty
pound
a
year
,
which
his
necessity
compel
him
to
accept
,
take
the
whole
trouble
of
educate
the
child
upon
himself
,
contrive
an
excellent
system
for
that
purpose
,
and
by
his
assiduity
and
knowledge
execute
all
the
particular
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
those
concern
,
who
by
the
bye
,
never
inquire
into
his
qualification
,
but
suffer
the
other
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
labour
and
ingenuity
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
a
large
stock
of
avarice
,
ignorance
and
vanity
,
this
superior
have
certain
ridiculous
peculiarity
in
his
person
,
such
as
a
hunch
upon
his
back
,
and
distort
limb
,
that
seem
to
attract
the
satirical
notice
of
Peregrine
,
who
,
young
as
he
be
,
take
offence
at
his
want
of
reverence
for
his
usher
,
over
whom
he
sometimes
choose
opportunity
of
display
his
authority
,
that
the
boy
may
not
misplace
their
veneration
.
<EOS>
Mr
Keypstick
,
therefore
,
such
as
I
have
describe
him
,
incur
the
contempt
and
displeasure
of
this
enterprise
pupil
,
who
now
be
in
the
tenth
year
of
his
age
,
have
capacity
enough
to
give
him
abundance
of
vexation
.

chapter
XIII
<EOS>
He
exercise
his
talent
at
the
expence
of
the
school
-
master
,
whose
character
and
business
declining
,
he
desire
to
be
recall
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
German
profess
himself
a
man
of
learning
,
and
sometimes
affect
to
make
a
parade
of
it
,
by
examine
the
young
boy
on
the
rudiment
or
grammar
,
which
he
make
shift
to
comprehend
;
Peregrine
,
who
be
advance
as
far
as
Cornelius
Nepos
,
use
to
teize
and
perplex
him
,
by
frequently
beg
his
explanation
of
certain
sentence
in
that
author
,
while
the
usher
be
engage
in
some
other
employment
.
    
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
he
practise
a
thousand
pitiful
shift
to
conceal
his
own
nakedness
;
sometimes
reprehend
the
boy
for
disturb
him
in
his
meditation
,
sometimes
plead
the
weakness
of
his
eye
,
that
hinder
him
from
consider
the
passage
;
and
sometimes
remit
him
to
the
dictionary
,
as
a
punishment
for
his
inattention
when
it
be
construe
by
Mr
Jennings
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
evasion
,
he
be
persecute
by
his
tormentor
with
such
perseverance
,
that
he
could
find
no
other
resource
than
that
of
pretend
to
be
in
a
violent
hurry
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
always
quit
the
place
;
so
that
whenever
Perry
and
his
companion
be
incommode
by
his
presence
,
they
have
recourse
to
this
expedient
,
which
never
fail
to
expel
him
in
a
trice
.
    
<EOS>
not
content
with
have
thus
render
him
contemptible
in
the
eye
of
his
disciple
,
this
indefatigable
wag
exercise
his
invention
in
various
contrivance
,
to
plague
,
disturb
and
expose
him
.
    
<EOS>
Conscious
of
his
own
defect
in
point
of
stature
and
proportion
,
the
little
pedant
use
all
the
addition
of
art
and
address
to
improve
his
person
,
and
raise
himself
as
near
as
possible
to
the
standard
dimension
of
nature
;
with
this
view
he
wear
shoe
with
heel
three
inch
high
,
strut
like
a
peacock
in
walking
,
and
erect
his
head
with
such
muscular
exertion
,
as
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
extend
his
vision
downward
blow
the
preternatural
prominence
of
his
breast
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
therefore
,
take
advantage
of
this
foppery
,
use
to
strew
his
way
with
bean
-
shell
,
on
which
whenever
he
chance
to
tread
,
his
heel
slip
from
under
him
,
his
hunch
pitch
upon
the
ground
,
and
the
furniture
of
his
head
fall
off
in
the
shock
;
so
that
he
lie
in
a
very
ludicrous
attitude
for
the
entertainment
of
the
spectator
.
<EOS>
He
moreover
seize
opportunity
of
stud
his
breech
with
large
pin
,
which
when
he
sit
down
with
a
sudden
jirk
,
penetrate
the
skin
of
his
posterior
,
and
compel
him
to
start
up
again
with
infinite
expedition
,
and
roar
hideously
with
the
pain
.
<EOS>
nay
,
perceive
that
he
be
extremely
penurious
in
his
house
-
keeping
,
he
spoil
many
a
pot
of
excellent
soup
maigre
,
by
slily
convey
into
it
handful
of
salt
or
soot
,
and
even
drive
needle
into
the
head
of
sundry
fowl
,
that
from
the
suddenness
of
their
death
he
may
conclude
some
infection
be
communicate
to
his
poultry
,
and
dispose
of
them
accordingly
for
the
half
of
their
value
.
<EOS>
but
no
instance
of
young
Pickle
's
mischievous
talent
affect
him
with
such
immediate
perplexity
and
confusion
as
this
that
I
be
go
to
recount
.
    
<EOS>
be
apprize
by
one
of
his
friend
that
a
lady
of
fashion
intend
to
visit
his
school
on
a
certain
day
,
without
give
any
previous
notice
of
her
come
,
that
she
may
be
an
eye
-
witness
of
the
accommodation
in
his
house
before
she
would
commit
her
son
to
his
care
,
he
order
his
boarder
and
apartment
to
be
dish
out
for
the
occasion
,
spare
no
pain
in
adorn
his
own
person
,
and
in
particular
employ
a
whole
hour
in
adjust
a
voluminous
tye
,
in
which
he
propose
to
make
his
appearance
.
    
<EOS>
thus
prepare
,
he
wait
with
great
confidence
and
tranquillity
,
and
no
sooner
see
the
coach
appear
at
a
distance
,
than
he
go
to
his
closet
in
order
to
put
on
the
periwig
,
which
he
have
deposit
in
a
box
,
that
no
accident
may
ruffle
or
discompose
it
before
it
be
present
to
her
ladyship
;
but
neither
the
box
nor
its
content
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
think
it
may
be
misplace
by
some
of
the
servant
,
to
whom
he
call
with
great
eagerness
and
vociferation
,
while
he
himself
run
from
room
to
room
in
quest
of
what
he
want
:
the
domestick
could
give
him
no
intelligence
of
his
tye
;
he
hear
the
gate
open
to
admit
the
equipage
,
his
impatience
increase
,
he
swear
in
high
Dutch
,
the
noise
of
the
wheel
on
his
pavement
salute
his
ear
,
his
vexation
redouble
,
and
toss
his
night
-
cap
on
the
floor
,
he
waddle
down
stair
to
the
hall
for
his
ordinary
periwig
,
which
he
now
find
himself
compel
to
wear
.
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
his
distraction
when
he
understand
that
too
be
missing
!
<EOS>
he
become
quite
delirious
,
foam
at
the
mouth
,
dance
to
and
fro
in
the
passage
like
one
bereft
of
his
sense
,
blaspheme
alternately
in
English
and
French
,
and
must
have
be
find
by
the
lady
in
that
frantic
condition
,
have
not
his
servant
convey
him
to
his
own
chamber
by
force
.
    
<EOS>
the
noble
visitant
be
receive
by
Jennings
,
who
tell
her
that
Mr
Keypstick
be
confine
to
his
bed
,
and
explain
the
whole
oeconomy
of
the
school
so
much
to
her
satisfaction
,
that
she
resolve
to
honour
them
with
the
charge
of
her
own
offspring
.
<EOS>
Keypstick
fall
sick
in
good
earnest
,
and
his
intellect
seem
to
have
receive
a
rude
shock
from
the
violence
of
the
passion
into
which
he
have
be
precipitate
by
the
roguery
of
Peregrine
,
who
have
conceal
both
periwig
in
the
cellar
,
and
now
have
enjoy
his
trick
,
carry
them
back
unperceived
to
the
place
from
which
they
have
be
remove
.
    
<EOS>
a
whole
week
elapse
before
the
master
recover
so
much
temper
as
to
appear
decently
in
public
;
and
even
then
his
countenance
be
stormy
,
and
his
resentment
against
the
author
of
his
disgrace
so
intense
,
that
he
promise
a
reward
of
five
guinea
to
any
boy
that
would
discover
the
principal
actor
,
or
any
of
the
accomplice
concern
in
this
audacious
intrigue
;
declare
that
no
consideration
should
screen
the
offender
from
condign
punishment
,
could
they
once
be
convict
of
the
trick
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
have
not
conduct
this
Jeu
d'esprit
without
participation
,
and
some
there
be
privy
to
the
affair
whose
fidelity
be
not
incorruptible
;
but
their
secrecy
be
secure
by
the
terror
of
Peregrine
,
whose
authority
and
influence
be
such
as
to
baffle
the
master
in
all
his
endeavour
to
unravel
the
conspiracy
.
    
<EOS>
this
extraordinary
reserve
,
and
the
recollection
of
several
other
mortifying
joke
he
have
undergo
,
inspire
him
with
ungenerous
suspicion
of
Mr
Jennings
,
who
he
could
not
help
thinking
have
be
at
the
bottom
of
them
all
,
and
spirit
up
principle
of
rebellion
in
the
school
,
with
a
view
of
make
himself
independent
.
<EOS>
possess
with
this
chimera
,
which
be
void
of
all
foundation
,
the
German
descend
so
low
as
to
tamper
in
private
with
the
boy
,
from
whom
he
hope
to
draw
some
very
important
discovery
;
but
he
be
disappointed
in
his
expectation
;
and
this
mean
practice
reach
the
ear
of
his
usher
<EOS>
,
he
voluntarily
resign
his
employment
,
and
find
interest
to
obtain
holy
order
in
a
little
time
after
,
leave
the
kingdom
,
hope
to
find
a
settlement
in
some
of
our
american
plantation
.
    
<EOS>
the
departure
of
Mr
Jennings
produce
a
great
revolution
in
the
affair
of
Keypstick
,
which
decline
from
that
moment
,
because
he
have
neither
authority
to
enforce
obedience
,
nor
prudence
to
maintain
order
among
his
scholar
;
so
that
the
school
degenerate
into
anarchy
and
confusion
,
and
he
himself
dwindle
in
the
opinion
of
his
imployer
,
who
look
upon
him
as
superannuated
,
and
withdraw
their
child
from
his
tuition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
see
this
dissolution
of
their
society
,
and
find
himself
every
day
deprive
of
some
companion
,
begin
to
repine
at
his
situation
,
and
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
procure
his
release
from
the
jurisdiction
of
a
person
whom
he
both
detest
and
despise
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
go
to
work
,
and
compose
the
following
billet
,
address
to
the
commodore
,
which
be
the
first
speciman
of
his
composition
in
the
epistolary
way
.
    
<EOS>
Honoured
and
love
uncle
,
<EOS>
hope
you
be
in
good
health
,
this
serve
to
inform
you
,
that
Mr
Jennings
be
go
,
and
Mr
Keypstick
will
never
meet
with
his
fellow
.
<EOS>
the
school
be
already
almost
break
up
,
and
the
rest
daily
go
away
;
and
I
beg
of
you
of
all
love
to
have
me
fetch
away
also
,
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
bear
to
be
any
longer
under
one
who
be
a
perfect
ignoramus
,
who
scarce
know
the
declination
of
musa
,
and
be
more
fit
to
be
a
scare
-
crow
than
a
schoolmaster
;
hope
you
will
send
for
me
soon
,
with
my
love
to
my
aunt
and
my
duty
to
my
honoured
parent
,
crave
their
blessing
and
yours

a
message
to
her
closet
,
whither
<EOS>
it
be
her
custom
very
frequently
to
retire
.
<EOS>
She
be
out
of
humour
at
be
interrupt
,
and
therefore
do
not
peruse
this
speciman
of
her
nephew
's
understanding
with
all
the
relish
that
the
commodore
himself
have
enjoy
;
on
the
contrary
,
after
sundry
paralytical
endeavour
to
speak
,
(
for
her
tongue
sometimes
refuse
its
office
)
<EOS>
she
observe
that
the
boy
be
a
pert
jackanape
,
and
deserve
to
be
severely
chastise
for
treat
his
better
with
such
disrespect
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
undertake
his
godson
's
defence
,
represent
with
great
warmth
that
he
know
Keypstick
to
be
a
good

old

,
and
that
Perry
shew
a
great
deal
of
spirit
and
good
sense
in
desire
to
be
take
from
under
his
command
;
he
therefore
declare
that
the
boy
should
not
live
a
week
longer
with
such
a
shamble
son
of
a
bitch
,
and
sanction
his
declaration
with
abundance
of
oath
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
compose
her
countenance
into
a
look
of
religious
demureness
,
rebuke
him
for
his
profane
way
of
talking
,
and
ask
in
a
magisterial
tone
if
he
intend
never
to
lay
aside
that
brutal
behaviour
?
<EOS>
irritated
at
this
reproach
,
he
answer
in
term
of
indignation
,
that
he
know
how
to
behave
himself
as
well
as
e'er
<EOS>
a
woman
that
wear
a
head
,
have
her
mind
her
own
affair
,
and
with
another
repetition
of
oath
give
her
to
understand
that
he
would
be
master
in
his
own
house
.
    
<EOS>
this
insinuation
operate
upon
her
spirit
like
friction
upon
a
glass
globe
,
her
face
gleam
with
resentment
,
and
every
pore
seem
to
emit
particle
of
flame
.
<EOS>
She
reply
with
incredible
fluency
of
the
bitter
expression
.
<EOS>
He
retort
equal
rage
in
broken
hint
and
incoherent
imprecation
.
<EOS>
She
rejoin
with
redouble
fury
,
and
in
conclusion
he
be
fain
to
betake
himself
to
flight
,
ejaculate
curse
against
her
;
and
mutter
something
concern
the
brandy
-
bottle
,
which
,
however
,
he
take
care
should
never
reach
her
ear
.
    
<EOS>
from
his
own
house
he
go
directly
to
visit
Mrs
Pickle
,
to
whom
he
impart
Peregrine
's
epistle
with
many
encomium
upon
the
boy
's
promising
part
;
and
find
his
commendation
but
coldly
receive
,
desire
she
would
permit
him
to
take
his
godson
under
his
own
care
.
    
<EOS>
this
lady
,
whose
family
be
now
increase
by
another
son
that
seem
to
engross
her
care
for
the
present

Perry
during
a
course
of
four
year
,
and
with
regard
to
him
,
be
perfectly
wean
of
that
infirmity
know
by
the
name
of
maternal
fondness
;
she
therefore
consent
to
the
commodore
's
request
with
great
condescension
,
and
a
polite
compliment
to
him
on
the
concern
he
have
all
along

for
the
welfare
of
the

His

He
shake

heartily
by

from

bad

squeeze

say
,
"
Damn

You

"
even
Tom
Pipes
express
uncommon
satisfaction
on
this
joyful
occasion

and
come
up
to
Perry

thrust
forth
his
forepaw
,
and
accost
him
with
the
salutation
of

<EOS>
I
be
glad

halt
to
the

of
his

chamber
,
at
which
he
stand
hollow

"
Lord

Mr

why

in

<EOS>
"
I
harrow
you

the
commodore
,

<EOS>
I
believe
your

<EOS>
I
only
come
to
inform
you
that
here

your
cousin
,
whom
you

not

and
I

such
another

his
age
within
the
king
's
dominion

d'ye
see

either

<EOS>
I
will
say
no

"
<EOS>
"
well

I

answer
his

"
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
you
be
?
<EOS>
I
believe
so
too
;
"
cry
the
commodore
,
make
wry
face
and
mimic
the
action
of
dram
-
drinking
.
<EOS>
then
address
himself
to
Hatchway
,
"
Prithee
Jack
,
say
he
,
go
and
try
thy
skill
on
that
stubborn
hulk
;
if
any
body
can
bring
her

I

"
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
accordingly
take
his
station
at
the
door
,
convey
his
perswasion
in
these
word
,
"
what
will
not
you
turn
out
and
hail
little
Perry
?
<EOS>
It
will
do
your
heart
good
to
see
such
a
handsome
young
dog
;
I
be
sure
he
be
the
very
moral
of
you
,
and
as
like
as
if
he
have
be
spit
out
of
your
own
mouth
,
as
the
saying
be
;
do
shew
a
little
respect
for
your
kinsman

can
not
you
.
"
    
<EOS>
to
this
remonstrance
she
reply
in
a
mild
tone
of
voice
,
"
dear
Mr
Hatchway
,
you
be
always
teaze
one
in
such
a
manner
;
sure
I
be
,
no
body
can
tax
me
with
unkindness
,
or
want
of
natural
affection
;
"
so
say
,
she
open
the
door
,
and
advance
to
the
hall
where
her
nephew
stand
,
receive
him
very
graciously
,
and
observe
that
he
be
the
very
image
of
her
papa
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
he
be
conduct
by
the
commodore
to
the
house
of
his
parent
;
and
strange
to
tell
,
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
he
present
to
his
mother
than
her
countenance
change
,
she
eye
him
with
token
of
affliction
and
surprize
,
and
burst
into
tear
,
exclaim
her
child
be
dead
,
and
this
be
no
other
than
an
impostor
whom
they
have
bring
to
defraud
her
sorrow
.
<EOS>
trunnion
be
confound
at
this
unaccountable
passion
,
which
have
no
other
foundation
than
caprice
and
whim
;
and
Gamaliel
himself
so
disconcert
and
unsettle
in
his
own
belief
,
which
begin
to
waver
,
that
he
know
not
how
to
behave
towards
the
boy
,
whom
his
godfather
immediately
carry
back
to
the
garrison
,
swear
all
the
way
that
Perry
should
never
cross
their
threshold
again
with
his
goodwill
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
much
be
he
incense
at
this
unnatural
and
absurd
renunciation
,
that
he
refuse
to
carry
on
any
further
correspondence
with
Pickle
,
until
he
be
appease
by
his
sollicitation
and
submission
,
and
Peregrine
own
as
his
son
and
heir
.
<EOS>
but
this
acknowledgment
be
make
without
the
privity
of
his
wife
,
whose
vicious
aversion
he
be
oblige
,
in
appearance
,
to
adopt
.
<EOS>
thus
exile
from
his
father
's
house
,
the
young
gentleman
be
leave
entirely
to
the
disposal
of
the
commodore
,
whose
affection
for
him
daily
increase
,
insomuch
,
that
he
could
scarce
prevail
upon
himself
to
part
with
him
,
when
his
education
absolutely
require
that
he
should
be
otherwise
dispose
of
.
    
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
this
extraordinary
attachment
be
,
if
not
produce
,
at
least
rivette
by
that
peculiar
turn
in
Peregrine
's
imagination
,
which
we
have
already
observe
;
and
which
,
during
his
residence
in
the
castle
,
appear
in
sundry
stratagem
he
practise
upon
his
uncle
and
aunt
,
under
the
auspex
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
assist
him
in
the
contrivance
and
execution
of
all
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
nor
be
Pipes
exempt
from
a
share
in
their
undertaking
;
for
,
be
a
trusty
fellow
,
not
without
dexterity
in
some
case
,
and
altogether
resign
to
their
will
,
they
find
him
a
serviceable
instrument
for
their
purpose
,
and
use
him
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
sample
of
their
art
be
exhibit
upon
Mrs
Trunnion
,
from
whose
chamber
Peregrine
have
secrete
a
certain
utensil
,
diver
hole
be
drill
through
the
bottom
of
it
by
their
operator
;
and
then
it
be
replace
in
a
curious
case
that
stand
by
the
bed
-
side
,
in
which
it
be
reserve
for
midnight
-
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
good
lady
have
that
evening
make
several
extraordinary
visit
to
her
closet
,
and
that
sort
of
exercise
never
fail
of
have
a
diuretic
effect
upon
her
constitution
;
so
that
she
and
her
husband
be
scarce
warm
in
bed
,
when
she
find
it
convenient
to
reach
out
her
hand
,
and
introduce
this
receptacle
under
the
cloath
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
Peregrine
's
roguery
take
effect
.
    
<EOS>
the
commodore
,
who
have
just
compose
himself
to
rest
,
be
instantly
alarm
with
a
strange
sensation
in
his
right
shoulder
,
on
which
something
warm
seem
to
descend
in
various
stream
:
he
no
sooner
comprehend
the
nature
of
this
shower
,
which
in
a
twinkling
bedew
him
from
head
to
foot
,
than
he
exclaim
,
"
blood
and
oon
!
<EOS>
I
be
afloat
?
"
and
start
up
,
ask
with
great
bitterness
if
she
have
piss
through
a
watering
can
.
<EOS>
equally
surprize
and
offend
at
the
indecent
question
,
she
begin
to
regale
him
with
a
lecture
on
the
subject
of
that
respect
in
which
she
think
him
so
deficient
;
but
perceive
the
source
of
his
displeasure
,
be
silence
in
the
middle
of
the
first
sentence
;
and
after
a
short
pause
of
astonishment
,
scream
with
vexation
.
    
<EOS>
as
there
be
a
necessity
for
shift
the
bed
-
linnen
,
she
get
up
with
great
reluctance
,
rung
her
bell
,
and
when
her
maid
enter
,
present
this
new
fashioned
cullender
,
and
threaten
with
many
choleric
expression
to
split
it
into
a
thousand
piece
on
her
skull
.
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
the
phaenomenon
<EOS>
,
it
be
some
time
before
the
attendant
could
open
her
lip
in
her
own
vindication
;
at
length
,
however
,
she
protest
she
be
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
,
and
that
the
pot
be
sound
and
intire
when
she
rinse
it
in
the
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
Her
suspicion
be
of
consequence
transfer
upon
Perry
,
against
whom
she
utter
many
menacing
invective
;
though
she
be
afterwards
ashamed
of
disclose
her
resentment
,
and
in
the
mean
time
be
fain
to
take
up
her
night
's
lodging
in
another
apartment
;
while
Trunnion
,
after
a
string
of
unmeaning
oath
,
which
be
extort
from
him
by
his
present
uncomfortable
situation
,
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
adventure
;
and
Peregrine
with
his
confederate
,
applaud
themselves
in
secret
for
have
reduce
them
to
such
ridiculous
distress
.
    
<EOS>
encourage
by
the
impunity
with
which
they
perform
this
feat
,
our
associate
atchieve
another
,
that
have
like
to
have
be
attend
with
very
serious
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
have
one
day
receive
a
sudden
call
which
she
could
not
help
obey
,
her
nephew
,
who
be
always
on
the
scout
,
take
that
opportunity
of
glide
unseen
into
her
closet
,
and
find
her
case
open
,
infuse
into
one
of
the
bottle
a
good
quantity
of
powder
jallap
,
which
have
be
purchase
by
the
lieutenant
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
have
desire
the
apothecary
from
whom
he
buy
it
,
to
give
him
as
much
as
would
impregnate
two
quart
of
brandy
,
which
,
he
guess
,
each
bottle
may
contain
;
and
never
dream
that
the
patient
,
though
leave
to
her
own
discretion
,
be
in
any
danger
of
take
an
over
-
dose
;
he
therefore
direct
Perry
to
convey
the
whole
proportion
into
one
of
the
full
bottle
that
stand
at
some
distance
from
that
which
he
would
perceive
be
in
present
use
,
that
the
spirit
may
have
time
to
extract
the
virtue
of
the
root
before
it
should
come
to
their
turn
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
do
accord
to
his
prescription
,
and
a
very
small
hole
be
bore
in
the
wainscot
,
through
which
they
could
reconnoitre
her
from
another
room
;
they
observe
her
motion
by
turn
,
with
a
view
of
see
whether
or
not
she
would
be
alarm
by
the
extraordinary
taste
of
the
tincture
they
have
make
.
    
<EOS>
when
they
have
watch
in
this
manner
for
three
or
four
day
,
pipe
be
upon
duty
,
perceive
her
take
the
first
cup
of
the
composition
,
which
she
have
no
sooner
swallow
,
than
she
begin
to
shut
her
eye
,
smack
her
lip
,
spit
and
express
all
the
mark
of
loathing
and
disgust
:
nevertheless
,
she
seem
to
doubt
her
own
sense
,
rather
than
the
flavour
of
the
Coniac
,
the
neatness
of
which
she
have
already
experience
,
and
therefore
repeat
the
cordial
,
as
if
in
defiance
to
her
own
distaste
;
take
care
,
however
,
to
arm
her
palate
with
a
large
lump
of
sugar
,
through
which
it
be
strain
in
its
passage
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
be
startle
when
he
understand
she
have
take
such
a
dangerous
draught
of
the
medicine
,
especially
as
she
have
immediately
after
step
into
the
coach
to
go
to
church
,
where
he
fear
she
may
catch
cold
,
or
be
otherwise
affect
,
to
the
jeopardy
of
her
person
and
the
prejudice
of
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
nor
be
his
fear
altogether
disappointed
.
<EOS>
the
service
be
not
half
perform
,
when
Mrs
Trunnion
be
suddenly
take
ill
;
her
face
undergo
violent
flushing
and
vicissitude
of
complexion
;
a
cold
clammy
sweat
bedew
her
forehead
,
and
her
bowel
be
afflict
with
such
agony
,
as
compel
her
to
retire
in
the
face
of
the
congregation
.
    
<EOS>
She
be
bring
home
in
torture
,
which
be
a
little
assuaged
when
the
dose
begin
to
operate
;
but
such
be
the
excess
of
evacuation
she
sustain
,
that
her
spirit
be
quite
exhausted
,
and
she
suffer
a
succession
of
fainting
fit
that
reduce
her
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
,
in
spite
of
all
the
remedy
that
be
administer
by
a
physician
who
be
call
in
the
beginning
of
her
disorder
,
and
who
,
after
have
examine
the
symptom
,
declare
that
the
patient
have
be
poison
with
arsenic
,
and
prescribe
oily
draught
and
lubricate
injection
to
defend
the
coat
of
the
stomach
and
intestine
from
the
vellicate
particle
of
that
pernicious
mineral
;
at
the
same
time
hinting
,
with
a
look
of
infinite
sagacity
,
that
it
be
not
difficult
to
divine
the
whole
mystery
;
and
affect
to
deplore
the
poor
lady
,
as
if
she
be
expose
to
more
attempt
of
the
same
nature
;
thereby
glance
obliquely
at
the
innocent
commodore
,
whom
the
officious
son
of
Aesculapius
suspect
as
the
author
of
this
expedient
,
to
rid
his
hand
of
a
yoke
-
fellow
,
for
whom
he
be
well
known
to
have
no
great
devotion
.
<EOS>
this
impertinent
and
malicious
insinuation
make
some
impression
upon
the
by
-
stander
,
and
furnish
ample
field
for
slander
,
to
asperse
the
moral
of
Trunnion
,
who
be
represent
through
the
whole
district
as
a
monster
of
barbarity
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
sufferer
herself
,
though
she
behave
with
great
decency
and
prudence
,
could
not
help
entertain
some
small
diffidence
of
her
husband
:
not
that
she
imagine
he
have
any
design
upon
her
life
,
but
that
he
have
be
at
pain
to
adulterate
the
brandy
,
with
the
view
of
detach
her
from
that
favourite
liquor
.
    
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
she
resolve
to
act
with
more
caution
for
the
future
,
without
set
on
foot
any
inquiry
about
the
affair
;
while
the
commodore
impute
her
indisposition
to
some
natural
cause
,
after
the
danger
be
past
,
never
bestow
a
thought
upon
the
subject
;
so
that
the
perpetrator
be
quit
for
their
fear
,
which
,
however
,
have
punish
them
so
effectually
,
that
they
never
would
hazard
any
more
joke
of
the
same
nature

Chapter

stream
of
their
wit
upon
the
commodore
,
who
by
their
mean
be
embroil
with
an
attorney
,
and
terrify
with
an
apparition
.
   
<EOS>
the
shaft
of
their
wit
be
now
direct
against
the
commander
himself
,
whom
they
teize
and
terrify
almost
out
of
his
sense
.
<EOS>
one
day
while
he
be
at
dinner
,
Pipes
come
and
tell
him
that
there
be
a
person
below
that
want
to
speak
with
him
immediately
about
an
affair
of
the
great
importance
,
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
;
upon
which
he
order
the
stranger
to
be
tell
that
he
be
engage
,
and
that
he
must
send
up
his
name
and
business
.
<EOS>
to
this
demand
he
receive
for
answer
a
message
,
import
that
the
person
's
name
be
unknown
to
him
,
and
his
business
of
such
a
nature
,
that
it
could
not
be
disclose
to
any
one
but
the
commodore
himself
,
whom
he
earnestly
desire
to
see
without
loss
of
time
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
,
surprise
at
this
importunity
,
get
up
with
great
reluctance
in
the
middle
of
his
meal
,
and
descend
to
a
parlour
where
the
stranger
be
,
ask
in
a
surly
tone
what
he
want
with
him
in
such
a
damned
hurry
,
that
he
could
not
wait
till
he
have
make
an
end
of
his
mess
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
not
at
all
disconcert
at
this
rough
address
,
advanced
close
up
to
him
on
his
tiptoe
,
and
with
a
look
of
confidence
and
conceit
,
lay
his
mouth
to
one
side
of
the
commodore
's
head
,
whisper
softly
in
his
ear
,
"
Sir
,
I
be
the
attorney
whom
you
want
to
converse
with
in
private
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
the
attorney
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Trunnion
,
staring
and
half
choaked
with
choler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Sir
,
at
your
service
,
reply
this
retainer
to
the
law
,
and
if
you
please
,
the
sooner
we
dispatch
the
affair
the
well
;
for
'
tis
an
old
observation
,
that
delay
breed
danger
.
"
<EOS>
"
truly
,
brother
,
say
the
commodore
,
who
could
no
longer
contain
himself
,
I
do
confess
that
I
be
very
much
of
your
way
of
thinking
,
d'ye
see
;
and
therefore
you
shall
be
dispatch
in
a
trice
;
"
so
say
,
he
lift
up
his
walking
staff
,
which
be
something
between
a
crutch
and
a
cudgel
,
and
discharge
it
with
such
energy
on
the
seat
of
the
attorney
's
understanding
,
that
if
there
have
be
any
thing
but
solid
bone
,
the
content
of
his
skull
must
have
be
evacuate
.
    
<EOS>
Fortified
as
he
be
by
nature
against
all
such
assault
,
he
could
not
withstand
the
momentum
of
the
blow
,
which
in
an
instant
lay
him
flat
on
the
floor
,
deprive
of
all
sense
and
motion
;
and
Trunnion
hop
up
stair
to
dinner
,
applaud
himself
in
ejaculation
all
the
way
for
the
vengeance
he
have
take
on
such
an
impudent
petti
-
fog
miscreant
.
    
<EOS>
the
attorney
no
sooner
awake
from
this
trance
,
into
which
he
have
be
so
unexpectedly
lull
,
than
he
cast
his
eye
around
in
quest
of
evidence
,
by
which
he
may
be
enable
the
more
easily
to
prove
the
injury
he
have
sustain
;
but
not
a
soul
appear
,
he
make
shift
to
get
upon
his
leg
again
,
and
with
the
blood
trickle
over
his
nose
,
follow
one
of
the
servant
into
the
dining
-
room
,
resolve
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
the
assailant
,
and
either
extort
money
from
him
by
way
of
satisfaction
,
or
provoke
him
to
a
second
application
before
witness
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
enter
the
room
in
a
peal
of
clamour
,
to
the
amazement
of
all
present
,
and
the
terror
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
shriek
at
the
appearance
of
such
a
spectacle
;
and
address
himself
to
the
commodore
,
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you

Sir

you

have
screen
yourself
from
a
prosecution
,
by
send
all
your
servant
out
of
the
way
,
but
that
circumstance
will
appear
upon
trial
to
be
a
plain
proof
of
the
malice
propense
with
which
the
fact
be
commit
;
especially
when
corroborate
by

evidence

in

<EOS>
the
one
-
eyed
commander
who
have
be
satisfied
with
the
chastisement
he
have
already
bestow
upon
the
plaintiff
,
hear
him
read
this
audacious
piece
of
forgery
,
which
he
consider
as
the
effect
of
his
own
villany
,
start
up
from
table
,
and
seize
a
huge
turkey
that
lie
in
a
dish
before
him
,
would
have
apply
it
sauce
and
all
by
way
of
poultice
to

have
he
not

restrain
by
Hatchway
,
who
lay
fast
hold
on
both
his
arm

and
fix
him
to
his
chair
again
,
advise
the
attorney
to
sheer
off
with
what
he
have
get
.
<EOS>
far
from
follow
this
salutary
counsel
,
he
redouble
his
threat
,
and
set
trunnion
at
defiance
,
tell
him
he
be
not
a
man
of
true
courage
,
although
he
have
command
a
ship
of
war
,
or
else
he
would
not
have
attack
any
person
in
such
a
cowardly
and
clandestine
manner
.
<EOS>
this
provocation
would
have
answer
his
purpose
effectually
,
have
not
his
adversary
's
indignation
be
repress
by
the
suggestion
of
the
lieutenant
who
desire
his
friend
in
a
whisper
to
be
easy
,
for
he
would
take
care
to
have
the
attorney
toss
in
a
blanket
for
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
this
proposal
,
which
he
receive
with
great
approbation
,
pacify
him
in
a
moment
;
he
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
,
and
his
feature
relax
into
a
grim
smile
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
disappear
,
and
Ravine
proceed
with
great
fluency
of
abuse
,
until
he
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
Pipes
,
who
,
without
any
expostulation
,
lead
him
out
by
the
hand
,
and
conduct
him
to
the
yard
,
where
he
be
put
into
a
carpet
,
and
in
a
twinkling
send
into
the
air
by
the
strength
and
dexterity
of
five
stout
operator
,
whom
the
lieutenant
have
select
from
the
number
of
domestick
for
that
singular
spell
of
duty
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
the
astonished
vaulter
beg
for
the
love
of
God
and
passion
of
Christ
,
that
they
would
take
pity
upon
him
,
and
put
an
end
to
his
involuntary
gambol
;
they
be
deaf
to
his
prayer
and
protestation
,
even
when
he
swear
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
if
they
would
cease
torment
him
,
he
would
forget
and
forgive
what
be
pass
,
and
depart
in
peace
to
his

continue
the

exercise

<EOS>
Ravine
be
dismiss
in
a
most
melancholy
plight
,
bring
an
action
of
assault
and
battery
against
the
commodore
,
and
<EOS>
subpoena'd
all
the
servant
as
evidence
in
the
cause
;
but
as
none
of
them
have
see
what
happen
,
he
do
not
find
his
account
in
the
prosecution
,
though
he
himself
examine
all
the
witness
,
and
among
other
question
,
ask
whether
they
have
not
see
him
come
in
like
another
man
?
<EOS>
and
whether
they
have
ever
see
any
other
man
in
such
a
condition
as
that
in
which
he
have
crawl
off
?
<EOS>
but
this
last
interrogation
they
be
not
oblige
to
answer
,
because
it
have
reference
to
the
second
discipline
he
have
undergo
,
in
which
they

and
they
only
be
concern
;

no
person

bind
to
give
testimony
against

<EOS>
in
short
,
the

nonsuite

to
the
satisfaction
of
all
who
know
him

and
find
himself
under
the
necessity

the
letter
which
be
declare

a
scandalous
forgery

in
order
to
prevent
an
indictment
with
which
he
be
threaten
by
the
commodore
,
who
little
dreamt
that
the
whole
affair
have
be
plan
and
execute
by
Peregrine
and
his
associate
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
enterprize
in
which
this
triumvirate
engage
,
be
a
scheme
to
frighten
Trunnion
with
an
apparition
,
which
they
prepare
and
exhibit
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
to
the
hide
of
a
large
ox

a
most
terrible
appearance

the
jaw
of
a
shark
which
he
have
bring
from
sea
,
and
accommodate
with
a
couple
of
broad
glass
instead
of

<EOS>
on
the
inside
of
these

two

and
with
a
composition
of
sulphur
and
salt

petre

a
pretty
large
fuse

which
he
fix
between
two
row
of
the
tooth

<EOS>
this
equipage
be
finish
,
he
,
one
dark
night
choose
for
the
purpose
,
put
it
on
,
and
follow
the
commodore
into
a
long
passage
in
which
he
be
precede
by
Perry
with
a
light
in
his
hand
,
kindle
his
fire
-
work
with
a
match
,
and
begin
to
bellow
like
a

<EOS>
the
boy

as
it
be
concert

look
behind
him
,
scream
aloud
,
and
drop
the
light

which

in
the
fall

when
trunnion
alarm
at
his
nephew

consternation
,
exclaim
,
"
zounds
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
and
turn
about
to
see
the
cause
of
his
dismay
,
beheld
a
hideous
phantom
vomit
blue
flame
,
which
aggravate
the
horror
of
its
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
be
instantly
seize
with
an
agony
of
fear
,
which
divest
him
of
his
reason
;
nevertheless
,
he
,
as
it
be
mechanically
,
raise
his
trusty
supporter
in
his
own
defence
,
and
the
apparition
advance
towards
him
,
aim
it
at
this
dreadful
annoyance
with
such
a
convulsive
exertion
of
strength
,
that
have
not
the
blow
chance
to
light
upon
one
of
the
horn
,
Mr
Pipes
would
have
have
no
cause
to
value
himself
upon
his
invention
.
<EOS>
misapply
as
it
be
,
he
do
not
fail
to
stagger
at
the
shock
,
and
dread
another
such
salutation
,
close
with
the
commodore
,
and
have
trip
up
his
heel
,
retreat
with
great
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
Peregrine
,
pretend
to
recollect
himself
a
little
,
run
with
all
the
mark
of
disturbance
and
affright
,
and
call
up
the
servant
to
the
assistance
of
their
master
,
whom
they
find
in
a
cold
sweat
upon
the
floor
,
his

betoken
horror
and
confusion

<EOS>
Hatchway
raise
him
up

and
have
comfort
him
with
a
cup
of
Nantz
,
begin
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
his
disorder
:
but
he
could
not
extract
one
word
of
answer
from
his
friend
,
who
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
during
which
he
seem
to
be
wrap
up
in
profound
contemplation

pronounce
aloud
,

He

with
the

,
who
do
not
find
his
account
in

certain
it

entertain
such
a
large
proportion
of
it
,
that
not
satisfied
with
the
prank
they
have
already
play
,
they
still
persecute
the
commodore
without
cease
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
his
own
history
,
the
particular
of
which
he
delight
to
recount
,
he
have
often
rehearse
an
adventure
of
deer
-
steal
,
in
which
(
during
the
unthinking
impetuosity
of
his
youth
)
he
have
be
unfortunately
concern
.
<EOS>
far
from
succeed
in
that
atchievement
,
he
and
his
associate
have
(
it
seem
)
be
make
prisoner
,
after
an
obstinate
engagement
with
the
keeper
,
and
carry
before
a
neighbour
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
use
trunnion
with
great
indignity
,
and
with
his
companion
commit
him
to
jail
.
    
<EOS>
His
own
relation
,
and
in
particular
an
uncle
on
whom
he
chiefly
depend
,
treat
him
during
his
confinement
with
great
rigour
and
inhumanity
,
and
absolutely
refuse
to
interpose
his
influence
in
his
behalf
,
unless
he
would
sign
a
writing
,
oblige
himself
to
go
to
sea
within
thirty
day
after
his
release
,
under
the
penalty
of
be
proceed
against
as
a
felon
.
<EOS>
the
alternative
be
either
to
undergo
this
voluntary
exile
,
or
remain
in
prison
disown
and
desert
by
every
body
,
and
after
all
suffer
an
ignominious
trial
,
that
may
end
in
a
sentence
of
transportation
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
without
much
hesitation
,
embrace
the
proposal
of
his
kinsman
,
and
(
as
he
observe
)
be
in
less
than
a
month
after
his
discharge
turn
adrift
to
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
wave
.
    
<EOS>
since
that
period
he
have
never
maintain
any
correspondence
with
his
relation
,
all
of
whom
have
concur
in
send
him
off
;
nor
would
he
ever
pay
the
least
regard
to
the
humiliation
and
supplication
of
some
among
them
,
who
have
prostrate
themselves
before
him
,
on
the
advancement
of
his
fortune
:
but
he
retain
a
most
inveterate
resentment
for
his
uncle
,
who
be
still
in
being
,
tho
'
extremely
old
and
infirm
,
and
frequently
mention
his
name
with
all
the
bitterness
of
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
Perry
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
particular
of
this
story
,
which
he
have
hear
so
often
repeat
,
propose
to
Hatchway
,
that
a
person
should
be
hire
to
introduce
himself
to
the
commodore
,
with
a
supposititious
letter
of
recommendation
from
this
detest
kinsman
;
an
imposition
that
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
afford
abundance
of
diversion
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
relish
the
scheme
,
and
young
Pickle
have
compose
an
epistle
for
the
occasion
,
the
exciseman
of
the
parish
,
a
fellow
of
great
impudence
and
some
humour
,
in
whom
Hatchway
could
confide
,
undertake
to
transcribe
and
deliver
it
with
his
own
hand
,
and
also
personate
the
man
in
whose
favour
it
be
feign
to
be
writ
.
<EOS>
He
,
accordingly
,
one
morning
arrive
on
horseback
at
the
garrison
,
two
hour
at
least
before
trunnion
use
to
get
up
,
and
give
Pipes
,
who
admit
him
,
to
understand
,
that
he
have
a
letter
for
his
master
,
which
he
be
order
to
deliver
to
none
but
the
commodore
himself
.
<EOS>
this
message
be
no
sooner
communicate
,
than
the
indignant
chief
(
who
have
be
wake
for
the
purpose
)
begin
to
curse
the
messenger
for
break
his
rest
,
and
swear
he
would
not
budge
till
his
usual
time
of
turn
out
.
    
<EOS>
this
resolution
be
convey
to
the
stranger
,
he
desire
the
carrier
to
go
back
and
tell
him
,
he
have
such
joyful
tiding
to
impart
,
that
he
be
sure
the
commodore
would
think
himself
amply
reward
for
his
trouble
,
even
if
he
have
be
raise
from
the
grave
to
receive
them
.
    
<EOS>
this
assurance
,
flattering
as
it
be
,
would
not
have
be
powerful
enough
to
persuade
him
,
have
it
not
be
assist
with
the
exhortation
of
his
spouse
,
which
never
fail
to
influence
his
conduct

He
therefore
creep
out
of
bed
,
tho

not
without
great
repugnance

and
wrap
himself
in
his
morning

It
would
be
a
difficult
task
for
the
inimitable
Hogarth
himself
to
exhibit
the
ludicrous
expression
of
the
commodore
's
countenance
,
while
he
read
this
letter

<EOS>
It
be
not
a
stare
of
astonishment
,
a
convulsion
of
rage
,
or
a
ghastly
grin
of
revenge
,
but
an
association
of

up

ah

<EOS>
that
seem

stick
some

in
the
course
of
his
meditation
,
when
he
recollect
and
compare
the
circumstance
of
every
mortification
to
which
he
have
be
lately
expose
,
he
could
not
help
suspect
that
some
of
them
must
have
be
contrive
to
vex
him
;
and
as
he
be
not
ignorant
of
his
lieutenant
's
disposition
,
nor
unacquainted
with
the
talent
of
Peregrine
,
he
resolve
to
observe
them
both
for
the
future
with
the
utmost
care
and
circumspection
.
<EOS>
this
resolution
,
aid
by
the
incautious
conduct
of
the
conspirator
,
whom
,
by
this
time
,
success
have
render
heedless
and
indiscreet
,
be
attend
with
the
desire
effect
.
<EOS>
He
in
a
little
time
detect
Perry
in
a
new
plot
,
and
by
dint
of
a
little
chastisement
,
and
a
great
many
threat
,
extort
from
him
a
consession
of
all
the
contrivance
in
which
he
have
be
concern
.
    
<EOS>
the
commodore
be
thunderstruck
at
the
discovery
,
and
so
much
incense
against
Hatchway
for
the
part
he
have
act
in
the
whole
,
that
he
deliberate
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
demand
satisfaction
with
sword
and
pistol
,
or
dismiss
him
from
the
garison
,
and
renounce
all
friendship
with
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
so
long
accustomed
to
Jack
's
company
,
that
he
could
not
live
without
him
;
and
upon
more
cool
reflection
,
perceive
that
what
he
have
do
be
rather
the
effect
of
wantonness
than
malice
,
which
he
himself
would
have
laugh
to
see
take
place
upon
any
other
person
,
he
determine
to
devour
his
chagrin
,
and
extend
his
forgiveness
even
to
Pipes
,
whom
in
the
first
sally
of
his
passion
he
have
look
upon
in
a
more
criminal
light
than
that
of
a
simple
mutineer
.
<EOS>
this
determination
be
second
by
another
,
which
he
think
absolutely
necessary
for
his
own
repose
,
and
in
which
his
own
interest
and
that
of
his
nephew
concur
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
be
now
turn
of
twelve
,
have
make
such
advance
under
the
instruction
of
Jennings
,
that
he
often
dispute
upon
grammar
,
and
be
sometimes
think
to
have
the
well
in
his
contest
with
the
parish
-
priest
,
who
,
notwithstanding
this
acknowledge
superiority
of
his
antagonist
,
do
great
justice
to
his
genius
,
which
he
assure
Mr
Trunnion
would
be
lose
for
want
of
cultivation
,
if
the
boy
be
not
immediately
send
to
prosecute
his
study
at
some
proper
seminary
of
learning
.
    
<EOS>
this
maxim
have
more
than
once
be
inculcate
upon
the
commodore
by
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
,
over
and
above
the
deference
she
pay
to
the
parson
's
opinion
,
have
a
reason
of
her
own
for
wish
to
see
the
house
clear
of
Peregrine
,
at
whose
pry
disposition
she
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
.
    
<EOS>
induce
by
these
motive
,
which
be
join
by
the
sollicitation
of
the
youth
himself
,
who
ardently
long
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
,
his
uncle
determine
to
send
him
forthwith
to
Winchester
,
under
the
immediate
care
and
inspection
of
a
governor
,
to
whom
he
allow
a
very
handsome
appointment
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
whose
name
be
Mr
Jacob
Jolter
,
have
be
schoolfellow
with
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
who
recommend
him
to
Mrs
Trunnion
as
a
person
of
great
worth
and
learning
,
in
every
respect
qualify
for
the
office
of
a
tutor
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
add
,
by
way
of
eulogium
,
that
he
be
a
man
of
exemplary
piety
,
and
particularly
zealous
for
the
honour
of
the
church
of
which
he
be
a
member
,
have
be
many
year
in
holy
order
,
tho
'
he
do
not
then
exercise
any
function
of
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr
Jolter
's
zeal
be
so
exceedingly
fervent
,
as
,
on
some
occasion
,
to
get
the
well
of
his
discretion
:
for
,
be
an
high
-
churchman
,
and
of
consequence
<EOS>
a
malecontent
,
his
resentment
be
habituate
into
an
insurmountable
prejudice
against
the
present
disposition
of
affair
,
which
,
by
confound
the
nation
with
the
ministry
,
sometimes
lead
him
into
erroneous
,
not
to
say
absurd
calculation
;
otherwise
,
a
man
of
good
moral
,
well
verse
in
mathematick
and
school
-
divinity
,
study
which
have
not
at
all
contribute
to
sweeten
and
unbend
the
natural
sourness
and
severity
of
his
complexion
.
    
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
destine
to
the
charge
of
superintend
Perry
's
education
,
every
thing
be
prepare
for
their
departure
;
and
Tom
Pipes
,
in
consequence
of
his
own
petition
,
put
into
livery
,
and
appoint
footman
to
the
young
squire
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
before
they
set
out
,
the
commodore
pay
the
compliment
of
communicate
his
design
to
Mr
Pickle
,
who
approve
of
the
plan
,
tho
'
he
durst
not
venture
to
see
the
boy
;
so
much
be
he
intimidate
by
the
remonstrance
of
his
wife
,
whose
aversion
to
her
first
-
bear
become
every
day
more
inveterate
and
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
this
unnatural
caprice
seem
to
be
support
by
a
consideration
which
(
one
would
imagine
)
may
have
rather
vanquish
her
disgust
.
<EOS>
Her
second
son
Gam
,
who
be
now
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
age
,
have
be
ricketty
from
the
cradle
,
and
as
remarkably
unpromising
in
appearance
as
Perry
be
agreeable
in
his
person
.
<EOS>
as
the
deformity
increase
,
the
mother
's
fondness
be
augment
,
and
the
virulence
of
her
hate
against
the
other
son
seem
to
prevail
in
the
same
proportion
.
    
<EOS>
far
from
allow
Perry
to
enjoy
the
common
privilege
of
a
child
,
she
would
not
suffer
him
to
approach
his
father
's
house
,
express
uneasiness
whenever
his
name
happen
to
be
mention
,
sicken
at
his
praise
,
and
in
all
respect
behave
like
a
most
rancorous
step
-
mother
.
<EOS>
tho
'
<EOS>
she
no
longer
retain
that
ridiculous
notion
of
his
be
an
impostor
,
she
still
continue
to
abhor
him
,
as
if
she
really
believe
him
to
be
such
;
and
when
any
person
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
her
surprising
dislike
,
she
always
lose
her
temper
,
and
peevishly
reply
,
that
she
have
reason
of
her
own
,
which
she
be
not
oblige
to
declare
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
much
be
she
infect
by
this
vicious
partiality
,
that
she
break
off
all
commerce
with
her
sister
-
in
-
law
and
the
commodore
,
because
they
favour
the
poor
child
with
their
countenance
and
protection
.
    
<EOS>
Her
malice
,
however
,
be
frustrate
by
the
love
and
generosity
of
Trunnion
,
who
have
adopt
him
as
his
own
son
,
equip
him
accordingly
,
and
carry
him
and
his
governor
in
his
own
coach
to
the
place
of
destination
,
where
they
be
settle
on
a
very
genteel
footing
,
and
every
thing
regulate
accord
to
their
desire
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
behave
with
great
decency
at
the
departure
of
her
nephew
,
to
whom
,
with
a
great
many
pious
advice
,
and
injunction
to
behave
with
submission
and
reverence
towards
his
tutor
,
she
present
a
diamond
ring
of
small
value
,
and
a
gold
medal
,
as
token
of
her
affection
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
lieutenant
,
he
accompany
them
in
the
coach
;
and
such
be
the
friendship
he
have
contract
for
Perry
,
that
when
the
commodore
propose
to
return
,
after
have
accomplish
the
intent
of
his
journey
,
Jack
absolutely
refuse
to
attend
him
,
and
signify
his
resolution
to
stay
where
he
be
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
be
the
more
startled
at
this
declaration
,
as
Hatchway
be
become
so
necessary
to
him
in
almost
all
the
purpose
of
his
life
,
that
he
foresee
he
should
not
be
able
to
exist
without
his
company
.
<EOS>
not
a
little
affected
with
this
consideration
,
he
turn
his
eye
ruefully
upon
the
lieutenant
,
say
in
a
piteous
tone
,
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
leave
me
at
last
,
Jack
,
after
we
have
weather
so
many
hard
gale
together
?
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
my
limb
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
be
more
of
an
honest
heart
:
I
look
upon
you
as
my
foremast
,
and
Tom
Pipes
as
my
mizzen
;
now
he
be
carry
away
,
if
so
be
as
you
go
too
,
my
standing
rig
be
decay
,
d'ye
see
,
the
first
squall
will
bring
me
by
the
board
.
<EOS>
D####n
ye
,
if
in
case
I
have
give
offence
,
can
not
ye
speak
above
-
board
?
<EOS>
and
I
shall
make
you
amend
.
"
    
<EOS>
Jack
be
ashamed
to
own
the
true
situation
of
his
thought
,
after
some
hesitation
,
answer
with
perplexity
and
incoherence
,
"
no
,
damme
!
<EOS>
that
an't
<EOS>
the
case
neither
:
to
be
sure
you
always
use
me
in
an
officer
-
like
manner
,
that
I
must
own
,
to
give
the
devil
his
due
,
as
the
saying
be
;
<EOS>
but
for
all
that
,
this
here
be
the
case
,
I
have
some
thought
of
go
to
school
myself
to
learn
your
latin
lingo
;
for
,
as
the
saying
be
,
better
late
mend
than
never
do
well
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
inform
as
how
one
can
get
more
for
the
money
here
than
any
where
else
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
trunnion
endeavour
to
convince
him
of
the
folly
of
go
to
school
at
his
year
,
by
represent
that
the
boy
would
make
game
of
him
,
and
that
he
would
become
a
laughing
-
stock
to
all
the
world
;
he
persist
in
his
resolution
to
stay
,
and
the
commodore
be
fain
to
have
recourse
to
the
mediation
of
Pipes
and
Perry
,
who
employ
their
influence
with
Jack
,
and
at
last
prevail
upon
him
to
return
to
the
garison
,
after
trunnion
have
promise
he
should
be
at
liberty
to
visit
them
once
a
month
.
<EOS>
this
stipulation
be
settle
,
he
and
his
friend
take
leave
of
the
pupil
,
governor
and
attendant
,
and
next
morning
set
out
for
their
habitation
,
which
they
reach
in
safety
that
same
night
.
    
<EOS>
Such
be
Hatchway
's
reluctance
to
leave
Peregrine
,
that
he
be
say
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
to
have
look
misty
at
part
:
certain
I
be
,
that
on
the
road
homeward
,
after
a
long
pause
of
silence
,
which
the
commodore
never
dreamt
of
interrupting
,
he
exclaim
all
of
a
sudden
,
"
I
will
be
damn
if
the
dog
han't
give
me
some
stuff
to
make
me
love
him
.
"
    
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
something
congenial
in
the
disposition
of
these
two
friend
,
which
never
fail
to
manifest
itself
in
the
sequel
,
howsoever
different
<EOS>
their
education
,
circumstance
and
connexion
happen
to
be
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
XVIII
Peregrine
distinguish
himself
among
his
school
-
fellow
,
expose
his
tutor
,
and
attract
the
particular
notice
of
the
master
.
   
<EOS>
thus
leave
to
the
prosecution
of
his
study
,
Peregrine
be
in
a
little
time
a
distinguish
character
,
not
only
for
his
acuteness
of
apprehension
,
but
also
for
that
mischievous
fertility
of
fancy
,
of
which
we
have
already
give
such
pregnant
example
.
<EOS>
but
as
there
be
a
great
number
of
such
luminary
in
this
new
sphere
to
which
he
belong
,
his
talent
be
not
so
conspicuous
,
while
they
shine
in
his
single
capacity
,
as
they
afterwards
appear
,
when
they
concentrate
and
reflect
the
ray
of
the
whole
constellation
.
    
<EOS>
at
first
he
confine
himself
to
piddle
game
,
exercise
his
genius
upon
his
own
tutor
,
who
attract
this
attention
,
by
endeavour
to
season
his
mind
with
certain
political
maxim
,
the
fallacy
of
which
he
have
discernment
enough
to
perceive
.
<EOS>
scarce
a
day
pass
,
on
which
he
do
not
find
mean
to
render
Mr
Jolter
the
object
of
ridicule
;
his
violent
prejudice
,
ludicrous
vanity
,
aukward
solemnity
and
ignorance
of
mankind
,
afford
continual
food
for
the
raillery
,
petulance
and
satire
of
his
pupil
,
who
never
neglect
an
opportunity
of
laughing
,
and
make
other
laugh
at
his
expence
.
    
<EOS>
sometimes
in
their
party
,
by
mix
brandy
in
his
wine
,
he
decoy
this
pedagogue
into
a
debauch
,
during
which
his
caution
forsook
him
,
and
he
expose
himself
to
the
censure
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
the
conversation
turn
upon
intricate
subject
,
he
practise
upon
him
the
socratic
method
of
confutation
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
be
inform
,
by
an
artful
train
of
puzzle
question
,
insensibly
betray
him
into
self
-
contradiction
:
and
at
one
time
he
,
in
a
most
dexterous
manner
,
set
on
foot
a
correspondence
between
him
and
the
chambermaid
of
the
house
,
which
end
in
his
utter
shame
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
the
wench
be
handsome
,
Jolter
be
frail
;
and
one
evening
,
while
in
his
cup
,
beheld
her
with
a
carnal
eye
.
    
<EOS>
Perry
,
who
be
ever
on
the
catch
,
discover
his
longing
,
and
prevail
upon
the
object
of
his
passion
to
feed
his
flame
with
small
favour
,
until
it
become
too
violent
to
be
restrain
:
he
then
urge
his
address
with
redouble
ardor
,
promise
,
vow
,
bribe
and
intreate
;
the
inamorata
seem
to
yield
,
and
bless
him
with
a
declaration
,
that
her
chamber
-
door
should
be
leave
open
at
midnight
.
    
<EOS>
true
to
the
assignation
,
he
rise
at
the
hour
appoint
,
and
full
of
the
most
vigorous
expectation
,
in
his
shirt
,
darkle
explore
his
way
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
.
    
<EOS>
His
heart
throb
with
joy
when
he
find
immediate
admittance
;
he
see
the
cap
of
his
Dulcinea
,
who
seem
to
be
asleep
;
he
spring
into
bed
,
and
clasp
in
his
arm
 
<EOS>
oh
heaven
!
<EOS>
no
other
than
the
traitor
Pipes
,
who
,
by
his
master
's
direction
,
personate
the
maid
;
and
return
the
embrace
with
such
muscular
contraction
,
that
the
unfortunate
lover
feel
the
disappointment
,
and
the
impossibility
of
disengage
himself
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
His
malicious
pupil
,
attend
by
another
scholar
who
live
in
the
same
house
,
and
the
fly
jilt
who
be
the
cause
of
this
disaster
,
immediately
enter
the
room
with
light
,
and
detect
the
forlorn
governor
in
all
the
mortification
of
disgrace
.
    
<EOS>
this
adventure
destroy
all
the
remain
of
authority
which
he
have
hitherto
preserve
over
Peregrine
;
so
that
,
for
the
future
,
no
sort
of
ceremony
subsist
between
them
,
and
all
Mr
Jolter
's
precept
be
convey
in
hint
of
friendly
advice
,
which
the
other
may
either
follow
or
neglect
at
his
own
pleasure
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
that
Peregrine
give
a
loose
to
his
inclination
,
and
by
dint
of
genius
and
an
enterprise
temper
,
make
a
figure
among
the
young
class
of
hero
in
the
college
.
    
<EOS>
before
he
have
be
a
full
year
at
Winchester
,
he
have
signalize
himself
in
so
many
atchievement
,
in
defiance
to
the
law
and
regulation
of
the
place
,
that
he
be
look
upon
with
admiration
,
and
actually
choose
Dux
,
or
leader
,
by
a
large
body
of
his
contemporary
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
his
fame
reach
the
ear
of
the
master
,
who
send
for
Mr
Jolter
,
communicate
to
him
the
information
he
have
receive
,
and
desire
him
to
check
the
vivacity
of
his
charge
,
and
redouble
his
vigilance
in
time
to
come
,
else
he
should
be
oblige
to
make
a
public
example
of
his
pupil
for
the
benefit
of
the
school
.
    
<EOS>
the
governor
,
conscious
of
his
own
unimportance
,
be
not
a
little
disconcert
at
this
injunction
,
which
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
fulfil
by
any
compulsive
mean
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
go
home
in
a
very
pensive
mood
,
and
after
mature
deliberation
,
resolve
to
expostulate
with
Peregrine
in
the
most
familiar
term
,
and
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
from
practice
which
may
affect
his
character
as
well
as
interest
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
frankly
tell
him
the
subject
of
the
master
's
discourse
,
represent
the
disgrace
he
may
incur
by
neglect
this
warning
;
and
put
him
in
mind
of
his
own
situation
,
hint
the
consequence
of
the
commodore
's
displeasure
,
in
case
he
should
be
bring
to
disapprove
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
these
insinuation
make
the
great
impression
,
as
they
be
deliver
with
many
expression
of
friendship
and
concern
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
be
not
so
raw
,
but
that
he
could
perceive
the
solidity
of
Mr
Jolter
's
advice
,
to
which
he
promise
to
conform
,
because
his
pride
be
interested
in
the
affair
;
and
he
consider
his
own
reformation
as
the
only
mean
of
avoid
that
infamy
which
even
in
idea
he
could
not
bear
.
    
<EOS>
His
governor
find
him
so
reasonable
,
profit
by
these
moment
of
reflection
,
and
<EOS>
in
order
to
prevent
a
relapse
,
propose
that
he
should
engage
in
some
delightful
study
that
would
agreeably
amuse
his
imagination
,
and
gradually
detach
him
from
those
connexion
which
have
involve
him
in
so
many
troublesome
adventure
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
he
,
with
many
rapturous
encomium
,
recommend
the
mathematic
,
as
yield
more
rational
and
sensible
pleasure
to
a
youthful
fancy
than
any
other
subject
of
contemplation
;
and
actually
begin
to
read
Euclid
with
him
that
same
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
enter
upon
this
branch
of
learn
with
all
that
warmth
of
application
which
boy
commonly
yield
on
the
first
change
of
study
;
but
he
have
scarce
advanced
beyond
the
Pons
Asinorum
,
when
his
ardor
abate
,
the
test
of
truth
by
demonstration
do
not
elevate
him
to
those
transport
of
joy
with
which
his
preceptor
have
regale
his
expectation
;
and
before
he
arrive
at
the
fortieth
and
seventh
proposition
,
he
begin
to
yawn
drearily
,
make
abundance
of
wry
face
,
and
think
himself
but
indifferently
pay
for
his
attention
,
when
he
share
the
vast
discovery
of
Pythagoras
,
and
understand
that
the
square
of
the
hypothenuse
be
equal
to
the
square
of
the
other
two
side
of
a
right
-
angle
triangle
.
<EOS>
He
be
ashamed
,
however
,
to
fail
in
his
undertaking
,
and
persevere
with
great
industry
,
until
he
have
finish
the
first
four
book
,
acquire
plain
trigonometry
,
with
the
method
of
algebraical
calculation
,
and
make
himself
well
acquaint
with
the
principle
of
surveying
.
<EOS>
but
no
consideration
could
prevail
upon
him
to
extend
his
inquiry
farther
in
this
science
;
and
he
return
with
double
relish
to
his
former
avocation
,
like
a
stream
which
be
dam
,
accumulate
more
force
,
and
burst
o'er
its
mound
,
rush
down
with
double
impetuosity
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
see
with
astonishment
and
chagrin
,
but
could
not
resist
the
torrent
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
be
now
no
other
than
a
series
of
licence
and
effrontery
;
prank
succeed
prank
,
and
outrage
follow
outrage
with
surprising
velocity
.
    
<EOS>
complaint
be
every
day
prefer
against
him
;
in
vain
be
admonition
bestow
by
the
governor
in
private
,
and
menace
discharge
by
the
master
in
publick
;
he
disregard
the
first
,
despise
the
latter
,
divest
himself
of
all
manner
of
restraint
,
and
proceed
in
his
career
to
such
a
pitch
of
audacity
,
that
a
consultation
be
hold
upon
the
subject
,
in
which
it
be
determine
that
this
untoward
spirit
should
be
humble
by
a
severe
and
ignominious
flogging
for
the
very
next
offence
he
should
commit
;
and
in
the
mean
time
that
Mr
Jolter
should
be
desire
to
write
in
the
master
's
name
to
the
commodore
,
request
him
to
remove
Tom
Pipes
from
the
person
of
his
nephew
,
the
say
Pipes
be
a
principal
actor
and
abettor
in
all
his
malversation
;
and
to
put
a
stop
to
the
monthly
visitation
of
the
mutilate
lieutenant
,
who
have
never
once
fail
to
use
his
permission
,
but
come
punctual
to
a
day
,
always
fraught
with
some
new
invention
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
by
this
time
,
Mr
Hatchway
be
as
well
know
,
and
much
better
belove
by
every
boy
in
the
school
than
the
master
who
instruct
him
,
and
always
receive
by
a
number
of
the
scholar
who
use
to
attend
Peregrine
when
he
go
forth
to
meet
his
friend
,
and
conduct
him
to
his
lodging
with
public
testimony
of
joy
and
applause
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
Tom
Pipes
<EOS>
he
be
not
so
properly
the
attendant
of
Peregrine
,
as
master
of
the
revel
to
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
He
mingle
in
all
their
party
,
and
superintend
the
diversion
,
decide
between
boy
and
boy
,
as
if
he
act
by
commission
under
the
great
seal
.
    
<EOS>
He
regulate
their
motion
by
his
whistle
,
instruct
the
young
boy
in
the
game
of
hussle
-
cap
,
leap
-
frog
,
and
chuck
farthe
;
impart
to
those
of
a
more
advanced
age
the
science
of
cribbidge
and
all
-
four
,
together
with
the
method
of
storm
the
castle
,
act
the
comedy
of
Prince
Arthur
,
and
other
pantomime
,
as
they
be
commonly
exhibit
at
sea
;
and
instruct
the
senior
who
be
distinguish
by
the
appellation
of
bloods
,
in
cudgel
play
,
dance
the
St
Giles
's
hornpipe
,
drink
flip
and
smoaking
tobacco
.
<EOS>
these
qualification
have
render
him
so
necessary
and
acceptable
to
the
scholar
,
that
exclusive
of
Perry
's
concern
in
the
affair
,
his
dismission
in
all
probability
,
would
have
produce
some
dangerous
convulsion
in
the
community
.
<EOS>
jolter
,
therefore
,
know
his
importance
,
inform
his
pupil
of
the
direction
he
have
receive
,
and
very
candidly
ask
how
he
should
demean
himself
in
the
execution
;
for
he
durst
not
write
to
the
commodore
without
this
previous
notice
,
fear
that
the
young
gentleman
,
as
soon
as
he
should
get
an
inkling
of
the
affair
,
would
follow
the
example
,
and
make
his
uncle
acquaint
with
certain
anecdote
,
which
it
be
the
governor
's
interest
to
keep
conceal
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
of
opinion
that
he
should
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
convey
any
complaint
to
the
commodore
;
and
if
question
by
the
master
,
assure
him
he
have
comply
with
his
desire
;
at
the
same
time
he
promise
faithfully
to
conduct
himself
with
such
circumspection
for
the
future
,
that
the
master
should
have
no
temptation
to
revive
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
but
the
resolution
attend
this
extorted
promise
be
too
frail
to
last
,
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
our
young
hero
find
himself
intangle
in
an
adventure
from
which
he
be
not
extricate
with
his
usual
good
fortune
.

chapter
XIX
<EOS>
He
be
concern
in
a
dangerous
adventure
with
a
certain
gardener
;
head
an
insurrection
in
the
school
;
take
the
field
with
his
adherent
,
march
up
into
the
country
,
and
fix
his
head
quarter
at
an
inn
.
   
<EOS>
He
and
some
of
his
companion
one
day
enter
a
garden
in
the
suburb
,
and
have
indulge
their
appetite
,
desire
to
know
what
satisfaction
they
must
make
for
the
fruit
they
have
pull
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
demand
what
(
in
their
opinion
)
be
an
exorbitant
price
,
and
they
with
many
opprobious
term
refuse
to
pay
it
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
be
surly
and
intractable
,
insist
upon
his
right
;
neither
be
he
deficient
or
spare
in
the
eloquence
of
vulgar
abuse
.
<EOS>
His
guest
attempt
to
retreat
,
a
scuffle
ensue
,
in
which
Peregrine
lose
his
cap
,
and
the
gardener
be
in
danger
from
the
number
of
his
foe
,
call
to
his
wife
to
let
loose
the
dog
,
who
instantly
fly
to
his
master
's
assistance
;
and
after
have
tear
the
leg
of
one
,
and
the
shoulder
of
another
,
put
the
whole
body
of
scholar
to
flight
.
<EOS>
enrage
at
the
indignity
which
have
be
offer
to
them
,
they
solicit
a
reinforcement
of
their
friend
,
and
with
Tom
Pipes
at
their
head
,
march
back
to
the
field
of
battle
.
<EOS>
Their
adversary
see
them
approach
,
call
his
apprentice
,
who
work
at
the
other
end
of
the
ground
,
to
his
assistance
,
arm
him
with
a
mattock
,
while
he
himself
wield
an
hoe
,
bolt
his
door
on
the
inside
,
and
flank
with
his
man
and
mastiff
,
wait
the
attack
without
flinch
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
not
remain
three
minute
in
this
posture
of
defence
,
when
Pipes
,
who
act
as
the
enemy
's
forlorn
hope
,
advance
to
the
gate
with
great
intrepidity
,
and
clap
his
foot
to
the
door
,
which
be
none
of
the
stout
,
with
the
execution
and
dispatch
of
a
petard
,
split
it
into
a
thousand
piece
.
<EOS>
this
sudden
execution
have
an
immediate
effect
upon
the
'
prentice
,
who
retreat
with
great
precipitation
,
and
escape
at
a
postern
gate
.
<EOS>
but
the
master
place
himself
like
another
hercule
in
the
breach
;
and
when
Pipes
brandish
his
cudgel
,
step
forward
to
engage
him
,
level
his
weapon
with
such
force
and
dexterity
at
his
head
,
that
have
the
skull
be
make
of
penetrable
stuff
,
the
iron
edge
must
have
cleave
his
pate
in
twain
.
<EOS>
casemated
as
he
be
,
the
instrument
cut
sheer
even
to
the
bone
,
on
which
it
strike
with
such
amazing
violence
,
that
spark
of
real
fire
be
produce
by
the
collision
.
<EOS>
and
let
not
the
incredulous
reader
pretend
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
phaenomenon
,
until
he
shall
have
first
peruse
the
ingenious
Peter
Kolben
's
natural
history
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
where
the
inhabitant
commonly
use
to
strike
fire
with
the
shin
-
bone
of
lion
which
have
be
kill
in
that
part
of
Africk
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
though
a
little
disconcert
,
far
from
be
disable
by
the
blow
,
in
a
trice
retort
the
compliment
with
his
truncheon
,
<EOS>
which
,
have
not
his
antagonist
expeditiously
slip
his
head
aside
,
would
have
lay
him
breathless
across
his
own
threshold
;
but
,
happily
for
him
,
he
receive
the
salutation
upon
his
right
shoulder
,
which
crash
beneath
the
stroke
,
and
the
hoe
drop
instantly
from
his
tingling
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
perceive
,
and
be
unwilling
to
forego
the
advantage
he
have
gain
,
dart
his
head
into
the
bosom
of
this
son
of
earth
,
and
overturn
him
on
the
plain
,
be
himself
that
instant
assault
by
the
mastif
,
who
fasten
upon
the
outside
of
his
thigh
.
<EOS>
feel
himself
incommode
by
this
assailant
in
his
rear
,
he
quit
the
prostrate
gardener
to
the
resentment
of
his
associate
,
who
pour
upon
him
in
shoal
,
and
turn
about
,
lay
hold
with
both
his
hand
of
this
ferocious
animal
's
throat
,
which
he
squeeze
with
such
incredible
force
and
perseverance
,
that
the
creature
quit
his
hold
;
his
tongue
loll
out
of
his
jaw
,
the
blood
start
from
his
eye
,
and
he
swing
a
lifeless
trunk
between
the
hand
of
his
vanquisher
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
his
master
that
he
do
not
longer
exist
;
for
by
this
time
he
be
overwhelm
by
such
a
multitude
of
foe
,
that
his
whole
body
scarce
afford
point
of
contact
to
all
the
fist
that
drum
upon
it
,
consequently
,
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase
,
his
wind
be
almost
knock
out
,
before
Pipes
have
leisure
to
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
and
persuade
his
offender
to
desist
,
by
represent
that
the
wife
have
go
to
alarm
the
neighbourhood
,
and
that
in
all
probability
,
they
would
be
intercept
in
their
return
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
listen
to
his
remonstrance
,
and
march
homeward
in
triumph
,
leave
the
gardener
in
the
embrace
of
his
mother
earth
,
from
which
he
have
not
power
to
move
when
he
be
find
by
his
disconsolate
helpmate
and
some
friend
whom
she
have
assemble
for
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
among
these
be
a
blacksmith
and
farri
,
who
take
cognizance
of
his
carcase
,
every
limb
of
which
have
examine
,
he
declare
there
be
no
bone
break
,
and
take
out
his
fleam
,
blood
him
plentifully
as
he
lie
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
then
convey
to
his
bed
,
from
which
he
be
not
able
to
stir
during
a
whole
month
,
and
his
family
come
upon
the
parish
,
a
formal
complaint
be
make
to
the
master
of
the
college
,
and
Peregrine
represent
as
the
ring
-
leader
of
those
who
commit
this
barbarous
assault
.
<EOS>
an
inquiry
be
immediately
set
on
foot
,
and
the
article
of
impeachment
be
fully
prove
,
our
hero
be
sentence
to
be
severely
chastise
in
the
face
of
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
disgrace
the
thought
of
which
his
proud
heart
could
not
brook
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
make
his
elopement
rather
than
undergo
the
punishment
to
which
he
be
doom
;
and
have
signify
his
sentiment
to
his
confederate
,
they
promise
,
one
and
all
,
to
stand
by
him
,
and
either
screen
him
from
chastisement
,
or
share
his
fate
.
    
<EOS>
confide
in
this
friendly
protestation
,
he
appear
unconcerned
on
the
day
that
be
appoint
for
his
punishment
;
and
when
he
be
call
to
his
destiny
,
advanced
towards
the
scene
,
attend
by
the
great
part
of
the
scholar
,
who
intimate
their
determination
to
the
master
,
and
propose
that
Peregrine
should
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
the
superior
behave
with
that
dignity
of
demeanor
which
become
his
place
,
represent
the
folly
and
presumption
of
their
demand
,
reprehend
them
for
their
audacious
proceeding
,
and
order
every
boy
to
his
respective
station
;
but
they
have
go
too
far
to
retract
,
and
instead
of
obey
the
injunction
they
have
receive
,
march
directly
out
of
the
college
,
with
their
captain
in
the
midst
of
them
,
and
halt
on
a
rise
ground
at
the
distance
of
a
short
mile
from
town
,
hold
a
council
to
deliberate
on
what
be
to
be
do
.
    
<EOS>
this
consultation
be
too
tumultuous
to
end
in
any
unanimous
decision
,
so
that
Mr
Pickle
put
himself
at
their
head
,
and
proceed
straight
forward
till
the
hurry
and
confusion
that
prevail
among
them
should
subside
;
while
Tom
Pipes
,
who
have
by
this
time
join
the
company
,
bring
up
the
rear
with
great
calmness
and
tranquillity
,
and
never
once
inquire
into
the
reason
of
this
extraordinary
migration
.
<EOS>
They
pursue
this
indeterminate
course
for
six
mile
,
when
a
public
-
house
present
itself
to
their
view
,
there
be
a
proposal
make
to
halt
for
refreshment
,
and
they
dispose
of
themselves
accordingly
,
as
the
conveniencie
of
the
place
would
permit
.
<EOS>
have
make
a
very
hearty
breakfast
on
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
,
which
they
take
care
to
dilute
with
a
proportionable
quantity
of
ale
;
a
motion
be
make
for
hold
another
board
,
from
which
the
young
boy
be
exclude
,
that
they
may
,
as
much
as
possible
,
avoid
clamour
and
distraction
in
their
counsel
.
    
<EOS>
here
Peregrine
be
invest
with
the
supreme
command
,
make
a
public
speech
to
his
constituent
,
wherein
have
thank
them
for
their
generous
interposition
in
his
favour
,
and
the
great
honour
they
now
confer
upon
him
,
he
observe
that
in
all
likelihood
,
they
should
in
a
little
time
reap
the
fruit
of
their
resolution
,
and
be
recall
with
honour
to
the
study
they
have
leave
;
but
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
persevere
a
little
longer
,
that
the
master
may
see
they
be
not
mere
boy
whom
they
have
disoblige
,
he
propose
that
they
should
dismiss
the
minor
brother
who
be
not
capable
of
endure
a
little
fatigue
,
and
deposit
all
their
money
in
the
hand
of
one
person
who
should
be
choose
for
that
trust
,
and
to
regulate
their
expence
upon
the
road
;
while
they
advance
farther
into
the
country
,
and
wait
patiently
for
the
term
which
would
undoubtedly
be
propound
unto
them
.
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
unanimously
embrace
,
the
money
produce
,
to
the
amount
of
ten
guinea
,
and
put
into
the
hand
of
pipe
,
who
be
elect
caterer
and
purser
to
the
whole
community
;
and
the
young
boy
be
exhort
to
return
,
the
rest
,
to
the
number
of
five
and
twenty
,
depart
under
the
auspex
of
Peregrine
,
who
conduct
them
ten
mile
farther
to
a
certain
village
,
where
they
take
up
their
lodging
at
an
inn
,
and
bespeak
something
hot
for
supper
;
after
which
they
call
for
punch
and
strong
beer
,
and
indulge
themselves
in
such
intemperance
,
that
in
a
little
time
riot
and
disorder
prevailing
,
they
sally
forth
in
quest
of
willing
dame
to
crown
their
enjoyment
,
and
commit
many
other
excess
which
the
prudence
and
authority
of
Peregrine
could
not
restrain
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
morning
the
landlord
save
them
the
trouble
of
call
for
a
bill
,
and
they
have
the
mortification
to
see
that
their
night
's
extravagance
have
mount
up
their
expence
to
one
half
of
their
whole
stock
.
<EOS>
They
discharge
the
reckoning
,
and
as
few
or
none
of
them
have
any
inclination
or
appetite
for
breakfast
,
put
themselves
in
motion
,
and
march
onwards
for
seven
mile
before
they
make
another
halt
.
<EOS>
this
happen
on
the
edge
of
a
common
,
where
they
perceive
the
sign
of
the
George
,
to
the
no
small
comfort
and
satisfaction
of
some
among
them
,
whose
tongue
by
this
time
cleave
to
the
roof
of
their
mouth
,
in
consequence
of
the
debauch
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
here
then
they
pause
,
and
have
moisten
their
throat
with
plentiful
stream
of
ale
,
begin
to
relish
the
situation
,
and
order
their
steward
to
provide
something
for
dinner
.
    
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
house
would
have
gladly
dispense
with
their
custom
,
as
they
have
no
great
faith
either
in
the
finance
or
principle
of
their
guest
,
who
seem
too
young
to
be
possess
of
much
money
or
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
live
in
a
solitary
place
,
unprovide
with
defence
against
the
insult
to
which
they
may
be
expose
from
the
resentment
of
such
a
disorderly
crowd
,
they
would
not
venture
to
signify
their
distrust
,
and
lament
that
there
be
nothing
in
the
house
with
which
they
could
entertain
them
.
<EOS>
Tom
Pipes
,
who
have
observe
a
flock
of
geese
upon
the
common
,
and
abundance
of
poultry
in
the
yard
,
take
no
notice
of
the
landlord
's
declaration
,
but
go
out
,
and
in
less
than
five
minute
return
with
provision
sufficient
to
regale
twice
the
number
of
his
associate
.
<EOS>
the
woman
durst
not
venture
to
disapprove
of
what
he
have
do
,
but
after
have
assure
him
that
the
fowl
be
none
of
her
own
,
very
peaceably
employ
her
whole
family
in
prepare
them
for
the
fire
,
and
some
bacon
and
green
be
add
to
the
repast
,
our
company
dispose
themselves
in
different
group
upon
the
grass
,
and
dine
with
great
mirth
and
satisfaction
,
without
once
recollect
that
another
such
meal
would
utterly
exhaust
their
common
fund
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
sweet
insensibility
do
not
long
prevail
;
about
four
o'clock
they
call
to
pay
,
and
be
very
much
startled
to
find
themselves
charge
no
less
than
two
pound
eleven
and
sixpence
for
the
entertainment
they
have
receive
.
    
<EOS>
They
look
upon
this
reckon
as
unconscionable
,
and
dispute
every
article
accordingly
;
but
the
landlady
solemnly
protest
that
the
sum
would
barely
indemnify
her
,
and
impute
great
part
of
the
charge
to
the
unnecessary
number
of
geese
and
chicken
which
have
be
slaughter
without
her
knowledge
or
consent
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
who
on
certain
subject
,
think
a
little
too
much
at
large
,
propose
to
punish
her
for
her
exorbitant
demand
,
by
march
off
without
pay
one
farthing
;
but
this
advice
Peregrine
decline
with
disdain
,
look
upon
such
an
expedient
as
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
the
corp
which
he
have
the
honour
to
command
;
and
order
that
the
bill
should
be
immediately
discharge
.
<EOS>
this
affair
be
settle
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
party
concern
,
they
resume
their
march
,
and
in
the
evening
arrive
at
a
certain
market
town
,
where
they
resolve
to
fix
their
quarter
until
they
should
hear
tiding
from
the
college
which
they
have
leave
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
they
choose
their
residence
at
the
good
inn
belong
to
the
place
,
and
determine
to
manage
the
remain
of
their
fortune
with
great
frugality
.
<EOS>
but
the
spirit
of
some
amongst
them
begin
to
flag
,
in
consequence
of
the
fatigue
of
their
journey
,
and
their
own
reflection
that
now
represent
the
folly
of
their
design
,
with
the
uncomfortable
circumstance
that
must
in
a
few
hour
attend
the
consumption
of
their
stock
;
this
prudent
scheme
of
oeconomy
be
over
-
rule
,
a
huge
bowl
of
punch
prepare
,
and
Pipes
order
to
enliven
the
company
with
a
song
.
<EOS>
Their
care
be
in
a
little
time
overwhelmed
,
and
the
great
part
of
the
night
be
consume
in
mirth
and
jollity
;
though
next
morning
they
wake
in
the
horror
,
and
universal
despondence
take
place
,
when
they
learn
that
their
bank
be
scarce
able
to
defray
the
expence
of
their
bill
,
which
they
receive
next
their
stomach
,
and
be
oblige
to
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
They
be
now
reduce
to
a
dilemma
that
occasion
another
general
consultation
,
in
which
they
agree
to
club
their
pocket
-
piece
and
silver
buckle
for
present
support
,
and
give
notice
by
letter
of
their
situation
to
their
respective
relation
,
take
care
to
ascribe
their
distress
to
the
ill
usage
they
have
meet
with
at
school
:
on
this
occasion
Peregrine
produce
the
ring
and
medal
he
have
receive
from
Mrs
Trunnion
,
and
Pipes
not
only
present
his
own
purse
,
which
be
pretty
well
furnished
,
but
even
make
a
proffer
of
his
silver
whistle
,
with
the
chain
by
which
it
have
for
many
year
depend
from
his
neck
.
<EOS>
They
thank
him
for
his
disinterested
attachment
,
but
all
his
sollicitation
could
not
prevail
upon
the
chief
to
profit
by
this
instance
of
his
good
fellowship
;
because
they
consider
him
as
a
person
whose
assistance
in
this
particular
it
be
neither
just
nor
honourable
to
use
.

correction
;
sublime
his

,
commence
gallant
,
and

Miss
Emily
Gauntlet

<EOS>
mean
while
the

,
surprised
and
disconcert
at
such
an
unprecedented
secession
,
convene
all
the
tutor
of
those
who
be
concern
in
this
dangerous
association
,
in
order
to
concert
proper
measure
for
recall
them
;
and
after
mature
deliberation
,
as
it
be
the
opinion
of
every
body
,
that
such
a
number
of
raw
,
hot
-
head
boy
,
without
money
,
conduct
,
experience
or
plan
,
could
not
possibly
cohere
for
any
length
of
time
<EOS>
,
they
resolve
to
leave
them
to
the
operation
of
their
own
passion
;
not
doubt
that
as
the
first
impulse
gradually
weaken
,
they
would
drop
off
one
by
one
,
and
the
whole
confederacy
be
thus
melt
down
.
<EOS>
the
return
of
the
young
boy
justify
the
prognostic
;
but
the
master
be
not
a
little
alarmed
,
when
they
understand
that
the
rest
have
choose
a
general
,
submit
to
certain
regulation
,
and
adopt
a
determinate
design
.
<EOS>
They
resolve
,
nevertheless
,
to
give
them
a
little
more
scope
,
and
wait
four
and
twenty
hour
for
the
effect
of
their
forbearance
;
when
hear
no
account
from
the
deserter
,
they
begin
to
consider
this
revolt
as
a
very
serious
affair
;
and
in
pursuance
of
their
advice
and
direction
,
the
governor
set
out
in
quest
of
their
stray
pupil
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
to
discover
the
rout
they
have
take
;
such
a
remarkable
caravan
could
not
pass
unheeded
;
they
get
intimation
of
their
advance
from
stage
to
stage
,
and
at
night
arrive
at
an
inn
that
stand
on
the
road
,
about
two
mile
short
of
the
town
where
the
adventurer
have
settle
their
head
quarter
.
<EOS>
from
hence
they
repair
in
a
body
to
the
house
of
a
neighbour
justice
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
their
representation
,
grant
a
warrant
to
apprehend
and
secure
the
body
of
Thomas
Pipes
,
as
an
idle
vagabond
and
seducer
of
youth
.
    
<EOS>
thus
authorise
,
they
go
early
next
morning
to
the
town
,
and
set
up
their
horse
at
another
inn
,
where
they
remain
incognito
,
until
they
have
engage
the
constable
with
a
competent
number
of
assistant
;
then
a
person
be
send
to
inform
Mr
Pipes
,
that
his
company
be
desire
at
the
White
Hart
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
receive
this
message
immediately
after
the
contribution
of
effect
,
already
mention
;
and
impart
the
content
to
his
master
,
who
rightly
judge
that
it
concern
the
common
cause
,
desire
him
to
obey
the
summon
.
<EOS>
He
follow
the
messenger
accordingly
;
and
no
sooner
set
his
nose
within
the
room
to
which
he
be
direct
,
than
the
constable
and
his
posse
spring
upon
him
,
before
he
have
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
,
or
any
opportunity
of
act
in
his
own
defence
.
    
<EOS>
thus
overpower
,
he
be
make
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
be
arrest
,
which
,
in
all
appearance
,
do
not
give
him
a
great
deal
of
concern
,
and
in
private
commit
to
jail
,
where
he
be
leave
to
his
own
meditation
.
    
<EOS>
this
previous
measure
be
successfully
take
,
the
tutor
go
into
separate
apartment
,
and
send
for
their
respective
pupil
,
each
ply
his
own
charge
in
particular
with
such
argument
as
he
judge
most
conducive
to
dissuade
him
from
persevere
in
the
imprudent
scheme
which
he
have
already
prosecute
too
far
.
<EOS>
no
great
eloquence
be
require
to
accomplish
this
aim
,
which
be
already
more
than
half
effect
by
their
own
reflection
;
and
therefore
the
great
part
of
them
yield
to
such
reasonable
remonstrance
,
and
consent
to
return
to
school
,
provide
they
may
be
indulge
with
a
general
amnesty
for
what
they
have
do
.
<EOS>
this
they
be
impowere
to
promise
to
all
of
them
,
except
Peregrine
,
whom
,
as
ringleader
and
first
cause
of
this
disturbance
,
the
master
have
mark
out
for
a
public
example
.
    
<EOS>
for
this
reason
he
stand
out
against
all
the
admonition
of
Mr
Jolter
,
who
in
vain
conjure
him
to
put
up
with
a
little
correction
,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
be
ignominiously
expel
,
and
of
forfeit
the
friendship
of
his
uncle
,
on
whom
he
know
his
chief
dependance
be
build
;
till
at
length
,
see
his
adherent
persuade
out
of
their
allegiance
,
and
himself
bereft
of
all
company
and
mean
of
subsistence
,
he
with
great
reluctance
resign
himself
to
his
fate
;
and
have
obtain
the
discharge
of
Pipes
,
be
reconducte
to
the
college
,
where
,
notwithstanding
the
intercession
of
his
governor
,
who
beg
earnestly
that
his
punishment
may
be
mitigate
,
our
unfortunate
hero
be
publickly
horse
,
in
terrorem
of
all
whom
it
may
concern
.
    
<EOS>
this
disgrace
have
a
very
sensible
effect
upon
the
mind
of
Peregrine
,
who
have
,
by
this
time
,
pass
the
fourteenth
year
of
his
age
,
begin
to
adopt
the
pride
and
sentiment
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
thus
dishonourably
stigmatize
,
he
be
ashamed
to
appear
in
public
as
usual
;
he
be
incense
against
his
companion
for
their
infidelity
and
irresolution
,
and
plunge
into
a
profound
reverie
that
last
several
week
,
during
which
he
shake
off
his
boyish
connection
,
and
fix
his
view
upon
object
which
he
think
more
worthy
of
his
attention
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
his
gymnastic
exercise
,
at
which
he
be
very
expert
,
he
contract
intimacy
with
several
youth
who
be
greatly
his
superior
in
point
of
age
,
and
who
,
please
with
his
aspire
genius
and
address
,
introduce
him
into
party
of
gallantry
,
which
strongly
captivate
his
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
by
nature
particularly
adapt
for
succeed
in
adventure
of
this
kind
;
over
and
above
a
most
engaging
person
that
improve
with
his
year
,
he
possess
a
dignified
assurance
,
an
agreeable
ferocity
which
inhance
the
conquest
of
the
fair
who
have
the
good
fortune
to
enslave
him
,
unlimited
generosity
,
and
a
fund
of
humour
which
never
fail
to
please
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
deficient
in
the
more
solid
accomplishment
of
youth
;
he
have
profit
in
his
study
beyond
expectation
,
and
besides
that
sensibility
of
discernment
which
be
the
foundation
of
taste
,
and
in
consequence
of
which
he
distinguish
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
Classics
,
he
have
already
give
several
specimen
of
a
very
promising
poetic
talent
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
complexion
and
these
qualification
,
no
wonder
that
our
hero
attract
the
notice
and
affection
of
the
young
Delias
in
town
,
whose
heart
have
just
begin
to
flutter
for
they
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
inquiry
be
make
concern
his
condition
;
and
no
sooner
be
his
expectation
know
,
than
he
be
invite
and
caress
by
all
the
parent
,
while
their
daughter
vye
with
each
other
in
treat
him
with
particular
complacency
.
<EOS>
He
inspire
love
and
emulation
wherever
he
appear
;
envy
and
jealous
rage
follow
of
course
;
so
that
he
become
a
very
desirable
,
though
a
very
dangerous
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
His
moderation
be
not
equal
to
his
success
;
his
vanity
take
the
lead
of
his
passion
,
dissipate
his
attention
,
which
may
otherwise
have
fix
him
to
one
object
;
and
he
be
possess
with
the
rage
of
increase
the
number
of
his
conquest
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
frequent
public
walk
,
concert
and
assembly
,
become
remarkably
rich
and
fashionable
in
his
cloath
,
give
entertainment
to
the
lady
,
and
be
in
the
utmost
hazard
of
turn
out
a
most
egregious
coxcomb
.
    
<EOS>
while
his
character
thus
waver
between
the
ridicule
of
some
,
and
the
regard
of
other
,
an
accident
happen
,
which
,
by
contract
his
view
to
one
object
,
detach
him
from
those
vain
pursuit
that
would
in
time
have
plunge
him
into
an
abyss
of
folly
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
be
one
evening
at
the
ball
which
be
always
give
to
the
lady
at
the
time
of
the
race
,
the
person
who
act
as
master
of
the
ceremony
,
know
how
fond
Mr
Pickle
be
of
every
opportunity
to
display
himself
,
come
up
and
tell
him
,
that
there
be
a
fine
young
creature
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
who
seem
to
have
a
great
inclination
to
dance
a
minuet
,
but
want
a
partner
,
the
gentleman
who
attend
her
be
in
boot
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
vanity
be
arrouse
at
this
intimation
,
he
go
up
to
reconnoitre
the
young
lady
,
and
be
strike
with
admiration
at
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
of
his
own
age
,
be
tall
,
and
tho
'
slender
,
exquisitely
shape
;
her
hair
be
auburn
,
and
in
such
plenty
,
that
the
barbarity
of
dress
have
not
be
able
to
prevent
it
from
shade
both
side
of
her
forehead
,
which
be
high
and
polished
;
the
contour
of
her
face
be
oval
,
her
nose
very
little
raise
into
the
aquiline
form
,
that
contribute
to
the
spirit
and
dignity
of
her
aspect
;
her
mouth
be
small
,
her
lip
plump
,
juicy
and
delicious
,
her
tooth
regular
and
white
as
drive
snow
,
her
complexion
incredibly
delicate
and
glow
with
health
,
and
her
full
blue
eye
beam
forth
vivacity
and
love
:
her
mein
be
at
the
same
time
command
and
engage
,
her
address
perfectly
genteel
,
and
her
whole
appearance
so
captivating
,
that
our
young
Adonis
look
,
and
be
overcome
.
    
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
recollect
himself
from
his
astonishment
,
than
he
advance
to
her
with
a
graceful
air
of
respect
,
and
beg
she
would
do
him
the
honour
to
walk
a
minuet
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
seem
particularly
pleased
with
his
application
,
and
very
frankly
comply
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
this
pair
be
too
remarkable
to
escape
the
particular
notice
of
the
company
:
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
be
well
know
by
almost
every
body
in
the
room
,
but
his
partner
be
altogether
a
new
face
,
and
of
consequence
undergo
the
criticism
of
all
the
lady
in
the
assembly
;
one
whisper
,
"
She
have
a
good
complexion
,
but
do
not
you
think
she
be
a
little
awry
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
second
pity
her
for
her
masculine
nose
;
a
third
observe
,
that
she
be
aukward
for
want
of
see
company
;
a
fourth
distinguished
something
very
bold
in
her
countenance
;
and
in
short
,
there
be
not
a
beauty
in
her
whole
composition
,
which
the
glass
of
envy
do
not
pervert
into
a
blemish
.
    
<EOS>
the
man
,
however
,
look
upon
her
with
different
eye
;
among
them
her
appearance
produce
an
universal
murmur
of
applause
;
they
encircle
the
space
on
which
she
dance
,
and
be
enchant
by
her
graceful
motion
.
<EOS>
while
they
launch
out
in
the
praise
of
her
,
they
express
their
displeasure
at
the
good
fortune
of
her
partner
,
whom
they
damn
for
a
little
finical
coxcomb
,
that
be
too
much
engross
by
the
contemplation
of
his
own
person
,
to
discern
or
deserve
the
favour
of
his
fate
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
hear
,
therefore
could
not
repine
at
these
invective
;
but
while
they
imagine
he
indulge
his
vanity
,
a
much
more
generous
passion
have
take
possession
of
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
instead
of
that
petulance
of
gaiety
for
which
he
have
be
distinguish
in
his
public
appearance
,
he
now
give
manifest
sign
of
confusion
and
concern
;
he
dance
with
an
anxiety
which
impede
his
performance
,
and
blush
to
the
eye
at
every
false
step
he
make
.
<EOS>
though
this
extraordinary
agitation
be
overlook
by
the
man
,
it
could
not
escape
the
observation
of
the
lady
,
who
perceive
it
with
equal
surprize
and
resentment
;
and
when
Peregrine
lead
this
fair
unknown
to
her
seat
,
express
their
pique
in
an
affected
titter
,
which
break
from
every
mouth
at
the
same
instant
,
as
if
all
of
them
have
be
inform
by
the
same
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
nettle
at
this
unmannerly
mark
of
disapprobation
,
and
,
in
order
to
increase
their
chagrin
,
endeavour
to
enter
into
particular
conversation
with
their
fair
rival
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
herself
,
who
neither
want
penetration
,
nor
the
consciousness
of
her
own
accomplishment
,
resent
their
behaviour
,
though
she
triumph
at
the
cause
of
it
,
and
give
her
partner
all
the
encouragement
he
could
desire
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
who
be
present
,
thank
him
for
his
civility
in
take
such
notice
of
a
stranger
,
and
he
receive
a
compliment
of
the
same
nature
from
the
young
gentleman
in
boot
,
who
be
her
own
brother
.
    
<EOS>
if
he
be
charm
with
her
appearance
,
he
be
quite
ravish
with
her
discourse
,
which
be
sensible
,
spirited
and
gay
.
    
<EOS>
Her
frank
and
sprightly
demeanour
excite
his
own
confidence
and
good
humour
;
and
he
describe
to
her
the
character
of
those
female
who
have
honour
them
with
such
a
spiteful
mark
of
distinction
,
in
term
so
replete
with
humorous
satire
,
that
she
seem
to
listen
with
particular
complacency
of
attention
,
and
distinguish
every
nymph
thus
ridicule
with
such
a
significant
glance
,
as
overwhelm
her
with
chagrin
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
seem
to
relish
each
other
's
conversation
,
during
which
our
young
Damon
acquit
himself
with
great
skill
in
all
the
duty
of
gallantry
;
he
lay
hold
of
proper
opportunity
to
express
his
admiration
of
her
charm
,
have
recourse
to
the
silent
rhetoric
of
tender
look
,
breathe
diver
insidious
sigh
,
and
attach
himself
wholly
to
her
during
the
remain
part
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
company
break
up
,
he
attend
her
to
her
lodging
,
and
take
leave
of
her
with
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
after
have
obtain
permission
to
visit
her
next
morning
,
and
be
inform
by
the
mother
that
her
name
be
Miss
Emilia
Gauntlet
.
    
<EOS>
all
night
long
he
close
not
an
eye
,
but
amuse
himself
with
plan
of
pleasure
,
which
his
imagination
suggest
,
in
consequence
of
this
new
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
arise
with
the
lark
,
adjust
his
air
into
an
agreeable
negligence
of
curl
,
and
dress
himself
in
a
genteel
grey
frock
trim
with
silver
binding
,
wait
with
the
utmost
impatience
for
the
hour
of
ten
,
which
no
sooner
strike
,
than
he
hie
him
to
the
place
of
appointment
,
and
inquire
for
Miss
Gauntlet
,
be
shew
into
a
parlour
.
<EOS>
here
he
have
not
wait
above
ten
minute
,
when
Emilia
enter
in
a
most
inchanting
undress
,
with
all
the
grace
of
nature
play
about
her
person
,
and
in
a
moment
rivette
the
chain
of
his
slavery
beyond
the
power
of
accident
to
unbind
.
    
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
still
abed
,
and
her
brother
go
to
give
order
about
the
chaise
,
in
which
they
propose
to
return
that
same
day
to
their
own
habitation
,
he
enjoy
her
company
<EOS>
tte
a
tte
a
whole
hour
,
during
which
he
declare
his
love
in
the
most
passionate
term
,
and
beg
that
he
may
be
admit
into
the
number
of
those
admirer
whom
she
permit
to
visit
and
adore
her
.
    
<EOS>
She
affect
to
look
upon
his
vow
and
protestation
as
the
ordinary
effect
of
gallantry
,
and
very
obligingly
assure
him
,
that
be
she
to
live
in
that
place
,
she
should
be
glad
to
see
him
often
;
but
as
the
spot
on
which
she
reside
be
at
a
considerable
distance
,
she
could
not
expect
he
would
go
so
far
upon
such
a
trifling
occasion
,
or
take
the
trouble
of
provide
himself
with
her
mamma
's
permission
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
favourable
hint
he
answer
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
most
fervid
passion
,
that
he
have
utter
nothing
but
the
genuine
dictate
of
his
heart
,
and
desire
nothing
so
much
as
an
opportunity
of
evince
the
sincerity
of
his
profession
;
and
that
though
she
live
at
the
extremity
of
the
kingdom
,
he
would
find
mean
to
lay
himself
at
her
foot
,
provide
he
could
visit
her
with
her
mother
's
consent
,
which
he
assure
her
he
would
not
fail
to
sollicit
.
    
<EOS>
She
then
give
him
to
understand
,
that
her
habitation
be
about
sixteen
mile
from
Winchester
,
in
a
village
which
she
name
,
and
where
(
as
he
could
easily
collect
from
her
discourse
)
<EOS>
he
would
be
no
unwelcome
guest
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
communication
they
be
join
by
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
who
receive
him
with
great
courtesy
,
thank
him
again
for
his
politeness
to
Emy
at
the
Ball
,
and
anticipate
his
intention
,
by
say
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
at
her
house
,
if
ever
his
occasion
should
call
him
that
way
.

by
the
lieutenant
,
reconveye
to
Winchester
,
and
send
a
letter
with
a
copy
of
verse
to
his
mistress
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
transport
with
pleasure
at
this
invitation
,
which
he
assure
her
he
should
not
neglect
;
and
after
a
little
more
conversation
on
general
topic
,
take
his
leave
of
the
charming
Emilia
and
her
prudent
mamma
,
who
have
perceive
the
first
emotion
of
Mr
Pickle
's
passion
for
her
daughter
,
and
be
at
some
pain
to
inquire
about
his
family
and
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
neither
be
Peregrine
less
inquisitive
about
the
situation
and
pedigree
of
his
new
mistress
,
who
,
he
learn
,
be
the
only
daughter
of
a
field
-
officer
,
who
die
before
he
have
it
in
his
power
to
make
suitable
provision
for
his
child
;
that
the
widow
live
in
a
frugal
,
though
decent
manner
,
on
the
pension
,
assist
by
the
bounty
of
her
relation
;
that
the
son
carry
arm
as
volunteer
in
the
company
which
his
father
have
command
;
and
that
Emilia
have
be
educate
in
London
,
at
the
expence
of
a
rich
uncle
,
who
be
seize
with
the
whim
of
marry
at
the
age
of
fifty
-
five
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
his
niece
have
return
to
her
mother
,
without
any
visible
dependance
,
except
on
her
own
conduct
and
qualification
.
    
<EOS>
this
account
,
though
it
could
not
diminish
his
affection
,
nevertheless
alarm
his
pride
;
for
his
warm
imagination
have
exaggerate
all
his
own
prospect
;
and
he
begin
to
fear
,
that
his
passion
for
Emilia
may
be
think
to
derogate
from
the
dignity
of
his
situation
.
<EOS>
the
struggle
between
his
interest
and
love
produce
a
perplexity
which
have
an
evident
effect
upon
his
behaviour
;
he
become
pensive
,
solitary
and
peevish
,
avoid
all
publick
diversion
,
and
grow
so
remarkably
negligent
in
his
dress
,
that
he
be
scarce
distinguishable
by
his
own
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
this
contention
of
thought
continue
several
week
,
at
the
end
of
which
the
charm
of
Emilia
triumph
over
every
other
consideration
;
and
have
receive
a
supply
of
money
from
the
commodore
,
who
act
towards
him
with
great
generosity
,
he
order
Pipes
to
put
up
some
linnen
,
and
other
necessary
,
in
a
sort
of
knapsack
which
he
could
conveniently
carry
,
and
thus
attend
set
out
early
one
morning
on
foot
for
the
village
where
his
charmer
live
,
at
which
he
arrive
before
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
have
choose
this
method
of
travelling
,
that
his
rout
may
not
be
so
easily
discover
,
as
it
must
have
be
,
have
he
hire
horse
,
or
take
a
place
in
the
stage
-
coach
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
thing
he
do
be
to
secure
a
convenient
lodging
at
the
inn
where
he
dine
;
then
he
shift
himself
,
and
accord
to
the
direction
he
have
receive
,
go
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
in
a
transport
of
joyous
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
as
he
approach
the
gate
his
agitation
increase
,
he
knock
with
impatience
and
concern
,
the
door
open
,
and
he
have
actually
ask
if
Mrs
Gauntlet
be
at
home
,
before
he
perceive
that
the
portress
be
no
other
than
his
dear
Emilia
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
without
emotion
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
her
lover
,
who
instantly
recognize
his
charmer
,
obey
the
irresistible
impulse
of
his
love
,
and
catch
the
fair
creature
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
seem
offend
at
this
forwardness
of
bahaviour
,
which
may
have
displease
another
of
a
less
open
disposition
,
or
less
used
to
the
freedom
of
a
sensible
education
;
but
her
natural
frankness
have
be
encourage
and
improve
by
the
easy
and
familiar
intercourse
in
which
she
have
be
breed
;
and
therefore
,
instead
of
reprimand
him
with
a
severity
of
look
,
she
with
great
good
humour
rally
him
upon
his
assurance
,
which
,
she
observe
,
be
undoubtedly
the
effect
of
his
own
conscious
merit
,
and
conduct
him
into
a
parlour
,
where
he
find
her
mother
,
who
in
very
polite
term
express
her
satisfaction
at
see
him
within
her
house
.
    
<EOS>
have
drank
tea
together
,
Miss
Emy
propose
an
evening
walk
,
which
they
enjoy
through
a
variety
of
little
copse
and
lawn
,
water
by
a
most
romantic
stream
,
that
quite
enchant
the
imagination
of
Peregrine
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
late
before
they
return
from
this
agreeable
excursion
,
and
when
our
lover
wish
the
lady
good
night
,
Mrs
Gauntlet
insist
upon
his
staying
to
supper
,
and
treat
him
with
particular
demonstration
of
regard
and
affection
.
<EOS>
as
her
oeconomy
be
not
encumber
with
an
unnecessary
number
of
domestic
,
her
own
presence
be
often
require
in
different
part
of
the
house
,
so
that
the
young
gentleman
be
supply
with
frequent
opportunity
of
promote
his
suit
,
by
all
the
tender
oath
and
insinuation
that
his
passion
could
suggest
.
    
<EOS>
He
protest
,
that
her
idea
have
take
such
entire
possession
of
his
heart
,
that
find
himself
unable
to
support
her
absence
one
day
longer
,
he
have
quit
his
study
,
and
leave
his
governor
by
stealth
,
that
he
may
visit
the
object
of
his
adoration
,
and
be
bless
in
her
company
for
a
few
day
without
interruption
.
    
<EOS>
She
listen
to
his
address
with
such
affability
as
denote
approbation
and
delight
,
and
gently
chid
him
as
a
thoughtless
truant
,
but
carefully
avoid
the
confession
of
a
mutual
flame
;
because
she
discern
,
in
the
midst
of
all
his
tenderness
,
a
levity
of
pride
which
she
durst
not
venture
to
trust
with
such
a
declaration
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
be
confirm
in
this
caution
by
her
mother
,
who
very
wisely
,
in
her
civility
to
him
,
maintain
a
sort
of
ceremonious
distance
,
which
she
think
not
only
requisite
for
the
honour
and
interest
of
her
family
,
but
likewise
for
her
own
exculpation
,
should
she
ever
be
tax
with
have
encourage
or
abet
him
in
the
imprudent
sally
of
his
youth
:
<EOS>
yet
notwithstanding
this
affect
reserve
,
he
be
treat
with
such
distinction
both
by
one
and
t'other
,
that
he
be
ravish
with
his
situation
,
and
become
more
and
more
enamour
every
day
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
remain
under
the
influence
of
this
sweet
intoxication
,
his
absence
produce
great
disturbance
at
Winchester
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
be
grievously
afflict
at
his
abrupt
departure
,
which
alarm
him
the
more
,
as
it
happen
after
a
long
fit
of
melancholy
which
he
have
perceive
in
his
pupil
.
    
<EOS>
He
communicate
his
apprehension
to
the
master
of
the
school
,
who
advise
him
to
apprize
the
commodore
of
his
nephew
's
disappearance
,
and
in
the
mean
time
inquire
at
all
the
inn
in
town
,
whether
he
have
hire
horse
,
or
any
sort
of
carriage
,
for
his
conveyance
,
or
be
not
meet
with
on
the
road
by
any
person
who
could
give
an
account
of
the
direction
in
which
he
travel
.
    
<EOS>
this
scrutiny
,
though
perform
with
great
diligence
and
minuteness
,
be
altogether
ineffectual
;
they
could
obtain
no
intelligence
of
the
runaway
.
<EOS>
Mr
Trunnion
be
well
nigh
distract
at
the
news
of
his
flight
;
he
rave
with
great
fury
at
the
imprudence
of
Peregrine
,
whom
in
his
first
transport
he
damn
as
an
ungrateful
deserter
;
then
he
curse
Hatchway
and
Pipes
,
who
he
swear
have
founder
the
lad
by
their
pernicious
counsel
;
and
,
lastly
,
transfer
his
execration
upon
Jolter
,
because
he
have
not
keep
a
well
look
-
out
:
finally
,
he
make
an
apostrophe
to
that
son
of
a
bitch
the
gout
,
which
for
the
present
disable
him
from
search
for
his
nephew
in
person
.
<EOS>
that
he
may
not
,
however
,
neglect
any
mean
in
his
power
,
he
immediately
dispatch
express
to
all
the
sea
-
port
town
on
that
coast
,
that
he
may
be
prevent
from
leave
the
kingdom
;
and
the
lieutenant
,
at
his
own
desire
,
be
send
across
the
country
,
in
quest
of
this
young
fugitive
.
    
<EOS>
four
day
have
he
unsuccessfully
carry
on
his
inquiry
with
great
accuracy
,
when
resolve
to
return
by
Winchester
,
where
he
hope
to
meet
with
some
hint
of
intelligence
,
by
which
he
may
profit
in
his
future
search
,
he
strike
off
the
common
road
,
to
take
the
benefit
of
a
nearer
cut
;
and
find
himself
benight
near
a
village
,
take
up
his
lodging
at
the
first
inn
to
which
his
horse
direct
him
.
    
<EOS>
have
bespoke
something
for
supper
,
and
retire
to
his
chamber
,
where
he
amuse
himself
with
a
pipe
,
he
hear
a
confused
noise
of
rustic
jollity
,
which
be
all
of
a
sudden
interrupted
,
after
a
short
pause
his
ear
be
salute
by
the
voice
of
Pipes
,
who
,
at
the
sollicitation
of
the
company
,
begin
to
entertain
them
with
a
song
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
instantly
recognize
the
well
-
know
sound
,
in
which
indeed
he
could
not
possibly
be
mistake
,
as
nothing
in
nature
bear
the
least
resemblance
to
it
;
he
throw
his
pipe
into
the
chimney
,
and
snatch
up
one
of
his
pistol
,
run
immediately
to
the
apartment
from
whence
the
voice
issue
:
he
no
sooner
enter
,
than
distinguish
his
old
ship
-
mate
in
a
crowd
of
country
peasant
,
he
in
a
moment
spring
upon
him
,
and
clap
his
pistol
to
his
breast
,
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
damn
you
,
Pipes
,
you
be
a
dead
man
,
if
you
do
not
immediately
produce
young
master
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
menacing
application
have
a
much
great
effect
upon
the
company
than
upon
Tom
,
who
look
at
the
lieutenant
with
great
tranquillity
,
reply
,
"
why
so
I
can
,
Master
Hatchway
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
safe
and
sound
?
<EOS>
"
cry
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
as
a
roach
,
"
answer
Pipes
,
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
friend
Jack
,
that
he
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
desire
him
to
proceed
with
his
song
.
<EOS>
this
be
perform
,
and
the
reckoning
discharge
,
the
two
friend
adjourn
to
the
other
room
,
where
the
lieutenant
be
inform
of
the
manner
in
which
the
young
gentleman
have
make
his
elopement
from
college
,
as
well
as
of
the
other
particular
of
his
present
situation
,
as
far
as
they
have
fall
within
the
sphere
of
his
comprehension
.
    
<EOS>
while
they
sit
thus
confer
together
,
Peregrine
have
take
his
leave
of
his
mistress
for
the
night
,
come
home
,
and
be
not
a
little
surprised
,
when
Hatchway
enter
his
chamber
in
his
sea
attitude
,
thrust
out
his
hand
by
way
of
salutation
.
<EOS>
His
old
pupil
receive
him
as
usual
,
with
great
cordiality
,
and
express
his
astonishment
at
meet
him
in
that
place
;
but
when
he
understand
the
cause
and
intention
of
his
arrival
,
he
start
with
concern
;
and
his
visage
glow
with
indignation
,
tell
him
he
be
old
enough
to
be
judge
of
his
own
conduct
,
and
when
he
should
see
it
convenient
,
would
return
of
himself
;
but
those
who
think
he
be
to
be
compel
to
his
duty
,
would
find
themselves
egregiously
mistaken
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
assure
him
,
that
for
his
own
part
he
have
no
intention
to
offer
him
the
least
violence
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
represent
to
him
the
danger
of
incense
the
commodore
,
who
be
already
almost
distract
on
account
of
his
absence
:
and
in
short
,
convey
his
argument
,
which
be
equally
obvious
and
valid
,
in
such
expression
of
friendship
and
respect
,
that
Peregrine
yield
to
his
remonstrance
,
and
promise
to
accompany
him
next
day
to
Winchester
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
overjoy
at
the
success
of
his
negociation
,
go
immediately
to
the
hostler
and
bespeak
a
post
-
chaise
for
Mr
Pickle
and
his
man
,
with
whom
he
afterwards
indulge
himself
in
a
double
cann
of
rumbo
,
and
when
the
night
be
pretty
far
advanced
,
leave
the
lover
to
his
repose
,
or
rather
to
the
thorn
of
his
own
meditation
;
for
he
sleep
not
one
moment
,
be
incessantly
torture
with
the
prospect
of
part
from
his
divine
Emilia
,
who
have
now
acquire
the
most
absolute
empire
over
his
soul
.
    
<EOS>
one
minute
he
propose
to
depart
early
in
the
morning
,
without
see
this
enchantress
,
in
whose
bewitching
presence
he
durst
not
trust
his
own
resolution
.
<EOS>
then
the
thought
of
leave
her
in
such
an
abrupt
and
disrespectful
manner
,
interpose
in
favour
of
his
love
and
honour
.
<EOS>
this
war
of
sentiment
keep
him
all
night
upon
the
rack
,
and
it
be
time
to
rise
before
he
have
determine
to
visit
his
charmer
,
and
candidly
impart
the
motive
that
induce
him
to
leave
her
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
repair
to
her
mother
's
house
with
a
heavy
heart
,
be
attend
to
the
gate
by
Hatchway
,
who
do
not
choose
to
leave
him
alone
;
and
be
admit
,
find
Emilia
just
rise
,
and
in
his
opinion
,
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
his
early
visit
,
and
the
gloom
that
overspread
his
countenance
,
she
stand
in
silent
expectation
of
hear
some
melancholy
tiding
;
and
it
be
not
till
after
a
considerable
pause
,
that
he
collect
resolution
enough
to
tell
her
he
be
come
to
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
though
she
strove
to
conceal
her
sorrow
,
nature
be
not
to
be
suppress
;
every
feature
of
her
countenance
sadden
in
a
moment
,
and
it
be
not
without
the
utmost
difficulty
that
she
keep
her
lovely
eye
from
overflow
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
situation
of
her
thought
,
and
in
order
to
alleviate
her
concern
,
assure
her
he
should
find
mean
to
see
her
again
in
a
very
few
week
;
mean
while
he
communicate
his
reason
for
depart
,
in
which
she
readily
acquiesce
;
and
have
mutually
console
each
other
,
their
transport
of
grief
subside
,
and
before
Mrs
Gauntlet
come
down
stair
they
be
in
a
condition
to
behave
with
great
decency
and
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
this
good
lady
express
her
concern
when
she
learn
his
resolution
,
say
,
she
hope
his
occasion
and
inclination
would
permit
him
to
favour
them
with
his
agreeable
company
another
time
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
who
begin
to
be
uneasy
at
Peregrine
's
stay
,
knock
at
the
door
,
and
be
introduce
by
his
friend
,
have
the
honour
of
breakfast
with
the
lady
;
on
which
occasion
his
heart
receive
such
a
rude
shock
from
the
charm
of
Emilia
,
that
he
afterwards
make
a
merit
with
his
friend
of
have
constrain
himself
so
far
,
as
to
forbear
commence
his
profess
rival
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
they
bad
adieu
to
their
kind
entertainer
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
set
out
from
the
inn
,
arrive
about
two
o'clock
in
Winchester
,
where
Mr
Jolter
be
overwhelm
with
joy
at
their
appearance
.
    
<EOS>
the
nature
of
this
adventure
be
unknown
to
all
except
those
who
could
be
depend
upon
,
every
body
who
inquire
about
the
cause
of
Peregrine
's
absence
,
be
tell
that
he
have
be
with
a
relation
in
the
country
,
and
the
master
condescend
to
overlook
his
indiscretion
;
so
that
Hatchway
see
every
thing
settle
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
friend
,
return
to
the
garrison
,
and
give
the
commodore
an
account
of
his
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
be
very
much
startled
when
he
hear
there
be
a
lady
in
the
case
,
and
very
emphatically
observe
,
that
a
man
have
better
be
suck
into
the
gulph
of
Florida
than
once
get
into
the
indraught
of
woman
;
because
in
one
case
,
he
may
with
good
pilotage
bring
out
his
vessel
safe
between
the
Bahama
's
and
the
indian
shore
;
but
in
the
other
there
be
no
outlet
at
all
,
and
it
be
in
vain
to
strive
against
the
current
;
so
that
of
course
he
must
be
embaye
,
and
run
chuck
upon
a
lee
-
shore
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
lay
the
state
of
the
case
before
Mr
Gamaliel
Pickle
,
and
concert
such
measure
with
him
as
should
be
think
likeliest
to
detach
his
son
from
the
pursuit
of
an
idle
amour
,
which
could
not
fail
of
interfere
in
a
dangerous
manner
with
the
plan
of
his
education
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Perry
's
idea
be
totally
engross
by
his
amiable
mistress
,
who
,
whether
he
sleep
or
wake
,
be
still
present
in
his
imagination
,
which
produce
the
follow
stanza
's
in
her
praise

Chapter
XXII
<EOS>
His
messenger

with
a
misfortune
,
to
which
he
apply
a
very
extraordinary
expedient
that
be
attend
with
strange
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
as
a
stage
coach
pass
within
two
mile
of
the
village
where
she
live
,
Tom
bargain
with
the
driver
for
a
seat
on
the
box
,
and
accordingly
depart
on
this
message
,
though
he
be
but
indifferently
qualified
for
commission
of
such
a
nature
:
have
receive
particular
injunction
about
the
letter
,
he
resolve
to
make
that
the
chief
object
of
his
care
,
and
very
sagaciously
convey
it
between
his
stocking
and
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
where
he
think
it
would
be
perfectly
secure
from
all
injury
and
accident
.
<EOS>
here
it
remain
until
he
arrive
at
the
inn
where
he
have
formerly
lodge
,
when
after
have
refresh
himself
with
a
draught
of
beer
,
he
pull
off
his
stocking
,
and
find
the
poor
billet
sully
with
dust
,
and
tear
into
a
thousand
tatter
by
the
motion
of
his
foot
in
walk
the
last
two
mile
of
his
journey
.
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
this
phaenomenon
,
he
utter
a
long
and

by
an
exclamation
of
"
Damn
my
old

"
<EOS>
then
he
rest
his
elbow
on
the
table
,
and
his
forehead
upon
his
two
fist
,
and
in
that
attitude
deliberate
with
himself
upon
the
mean
of
remedy
this
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
as
he
be
not
distract
by
a
vast
number
of
idea
,
he
soon
conclude
that
his
good
expedient
would
be
to
employ
the
clerk
of
the
parish
,
who
he
know
be
a
great
scholar
,
to
write
another
epistle
accord
to
the
direction
he
should
give
him
;
and
never
dream
that
the
mangle
original
would
in
the
least
facilitate
this
scheme
,
he
very
wisely
commit
it
to
the
flame
,
that
it
may
never
rise
up
in
judgment
against
him
.
    
<EOS>
have
take
this
wise
step
,
he
go
in
quest
of
his
scribe
,
to
whom
he
communicate
his
business
,
and
promise
a
full
-
pot
by
way
of
gratification
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
,
who
be
also
school
-
master
,
proud
of
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
his
talent
,
readily
undertake
the
task
;
and
repair
with
his
employer
to
the
inn
,
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
<EOS>
produce
a
morsel
of
eloquence
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
Pipes
,
that
he
squeeze
his
hand
by
way
of
acknowledgment
,
and
double
his
allowance
of
beer
,
which
be
discuss
,
our
courier
betook
himself
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
with
the
haunch
of
venison
and
this
succedaneous
letter
,
and
deliver
his
message
to
the
mother
,
who
receive
it
with
great
respect
,
and
many
kind
inquiry
about
the
health
and
welfare
of
his
master
,
attempt
to
tip
the
messenger
a
crown
,
which
he
absolutely
refuse
to
accept
,
in
consequence
of
Mr
Pickle
's
repeat
caution
.
    
<EOS>
while
the
old
gentlewoman
turn
to
a
servant
,
in
order
to
give
direction
about
the
disposal
of
this
present
,
Pipes
look
upon
this
as
a
favourable
occasion
to
transact
his
business
with
Emilia
,
and
therefore
,
shut
one
eye
,
with
a
jirk
of
his
thumb
towards
his
left
shoulder
,
and
a
most
significant
twist
of
his
countenance
,
he
beckon
the
young
lady
into
another
room
,
as
if
he
have
be
fraught
with
something
of
consequence
,
which
he
want
to
impart
.
<EOS>
She
understand
the
hint
howsoever
strangely
communicate
,
and
by
step
to
one
side
of
the
room
,
give
him
an
opportunity
of
slip
the
epistle
into
her
hand
,
which
he
gently
squeeze
at
the
same
time
in
token
of
regard
;
then
throw
a
side
-
glance
at
the
mother
,
whose
back
be
turn
,
clap
his
finger
to
one
side
of
his
nose
,
thereby
recommend
secrecy
and
discretion
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
convey
the
letter
into
her
bosom
,
could
not
help
smile
at
Tom
's
politeness
and
dexterity
;
but
lest
her
mamma
should
detect
him
in
the
execution
of
his
pantomime
,
she
break
off
this
intercourse
of
sign
,
by
ask
aloud
when
he
propose
to
set
out
on
his
return
to
Winchester
;
and
when
he
answer
"

"
Mrs
Gauntlet
recommend
him
to
the
hospitality
of
her
own
footman
,
desire
him
to
make
much
of
Mr

where
he
be

and
very
cordially

<EOS>
Our
young
heroine
,
impatient
to
read
her
lover
's
billet
,
which
make
her
heart
throb
with
rapturous
expectation
,
retire
to
her
chamber
as
soon
as
possible
,
with
a
view
of
peruse
the
content
,
which
be
these
.
     
<EOS>
Divine
empress
of
my
soul
!
<EOS>
if
the
refulgent
flame
of
your
beauty
have
not
evaporate
the
particle
of
my
transported
brain
,
and
scorch
my
intellect
into
a
cinder
of
stolidity
,
perhaps
the
resplendency
of
my
passion
may
shine
illustrious
through
the
sable
curtain
of
my
ink
,
and
in
sublimity
transcend
the
galaxy
itself
,
though
waste
on
the
pinion
of
a
grey
goose
quill
!
<EOS>
but
ah
!
celestial
enchantress
!
<EOS>
the
negromancy
of
thy
tyrannical
charm
hath
fetter
my
faculty
with
adamantine
chain
,
which
unless
thy
compassion
shall
melt
,
I
must
eternally
remain
in
the
tartarean
gulph
of
dismal
despair
.
<EOS>
Vouchsafe
therefore
,
o
thou
brightest
luminary
of
this
terrestrial
sphere
!
<EOS>
to
warm
as
well
as
shine
;
and
let
the
genial
ray
of
thy
benevolence
melt
the
icy
emanation
of
thy
disdain
,
which
hath
freeze
up
the
spirit
of
,
angelic
preheminence
!
<EOS>
thy
most
egregious
admirer
and
superlative
slave
 
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
never
be
astonishment
more
perplexing
than
that
of
Emilia
,
when
she
read
this
curious
composition
,
which
she
repeat
verbatim
three
time
before
she
would
credit
the
evidence
of
her
own
sense
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
fear
in
good
earnest
that
love
have
produce
a
disorder
in
her
lover
's
understanding
;
but
after
a
thousand
conjecture
by
which
she
attempt
to
account
for
this
extraordinary
fustian
of
stile
,
she
conclude
that
it
be
the
effect
of
mere
levity
,
calculate
to
ridicule
the
passion
he
have
formerly
profess
.
<EOS>
irritate
by
this
supposition
,
she
resolve
to
baulk
his
triumph
with
affected
indifference
,
and
in
the
mean
time
endeavour
to
expel
him
from
that
place
which
he
possess
within
her
heart
.
    
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
such
a
victory
over
her
inclination
may
have
be
obtain
without
great
difficulty
;
for
she
enjoy
an
easiness
of
temper
that
could
accommodate
itself
to
the
emergency
of
her
fate
;
and
her
vivacity
by
amuse
her
imagination
,
preserve
her
from
the
keen
sensation
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
thus
determine
and
disposed
,
she
do
not
send
any
sort
of
answer
,
or
the
least
token
of
remembrance
by
Pipes
,
who
be
suffer
to
depart
with
a
general
compliment
from
the
mother
,
and
arrive
at
Winchester
the
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
eye
sparkle
when
he
see
his
messenger
come
in
,
and
he
stretch
out
his
hand
in
full
confidence
of
receive
some
particular
mark
of
his
Emilia
's
affection
;
but
how
be
he
confound
,
when
he
feel
his
hope
so
cruelly
disappointed
!
<EOS>
in
an
instant
his
countenance
fall
.
<EOS>
He
stand
for
some
time
silent
and
abash
,
then
thrice
repeat
the
interrogation
of
"
what
!
<EOS>
not
one
word
from
Emilia
?
"
<EOS>
and
dubious
of
his
courier
's
discretion
,
inquire
minutely
into
all
the
particular
of
his
reception
.
<EOS>
He
ask
if
he
have
see
the
young
lady
,
if
she
be
in
good
health
,
if
he
have
find
an
opportunity
of
deliver
his
letter
,
and
how
she
look
when
he
put
it
into
her
hand
?
<EOS>
pipe
answer
,
that
he
have
never
see
her
in
well
health
or
high
spirit
;
that
he
have
manage
matter
so
as
not
only
to
present
the
billet
unperceived
,
but
also
to
ask
her
command
in
private
before
he
take
his
leave
,
when
she
tell
him
that
the
letter
require
no
reply
.
<EOS>
this
last
circumstance
he
consider
as
a
manifest
mark
of
disrespect
,
and
gnaw
his
lip
with
resentment
.
<EOS>
upon
further
reflexion
,
however
,
he
suppose
that
she
could
not
conveniently
write
by
the
messenger
,
and
would
undoubtedly
favour
him
by
the
post
.
    
<EOS>
this
consideration
console
him
for
the
present
,
and
he
wait
impatiently
for
the
fruit
of
his
hope
;
but
after
he
have
see
eight
day
elapse
without
reap
the
satisfaction
with
which
he
have
flatter
himself
,
his
temper
forsook
him
<EOS>
,
he
rave
against
the
whole
sex
,
and
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
sullen
chagrin
;
but
his
pride
in
a
little
time
come
to
his
assistance
,
and
rescue
him
from
the
horror
of
the
melancholy
fiend
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
retort
her
own
neglect
upon
his
ungrateful
mistress
,
his
countenance
gradually
resume
its
former
serenity
;
and
though
by
this
time
he
be
pretty
well
cure
of
his
foppery
,
he
appear
again
at
public
diversion
with
an
air
of
gaiety
and
unconcern
,
that
Emilia
may
have
a
chance
of
hear
how
much
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
disregard
her
disdain
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
never
want
certain
officious
person
,
who
take
pleasure
in
promote
intelligence
of
this
sort
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
soon
reach
the
ear
of
Miss
Gauntlet
,
and
confirm
her
in
the
opinion
she
have
conceive
from
his
letter
;
so
that
she
fortify
herself
in
her
former
sentiment
,
and
bear
his
indifference
with
great
philosophy
.
<EOS>
thus
a
correspondence
which
have
commence
with
all
the
tenderness
and
sincerity
of
love
,
and
every
promise
of
duration
,
be
interrupt
in
its
infancy
by
a
misunderstanding
occasion
by
the
simplicity
of
Pipes
,
who
never
once
reflect
upon
the
consequence
of
his
deceit
.
    
<EOS>
though
their
mutual
passion
be
by
these
mean
suppress
for
the
present
,
it
be
not
altogether
extinguish
,
but
glow
in
secret
,
though
even
to
themselves
unknown
,
until
an
occasion
which
afterwards
offer
,
blow
up
the
latent
flame
,
and
love
resume
his
empire
in
their
breast
.
    
<EOS>
while
they
move
,
as
it
be
,
without
the
sphere
of
each
other
's
attraction
,
the
commodore
fear
that
Perry
be
in
danger
of
involve
himself
in
some
pernicious
engagement
,
resolve
by
advice
of
Mr
Jolter
and
his
friend
the
parish
priest
,
to
recal
him
from
the
place
where
he
have
contract
such
imprudent
connexion
,
and
send
him
to
the
university
,
where
his
education
may
be
compleate
,
and
his
fancy
wean
from
all
puerile
amusement
.
    
<EOS>
this
plan
have
be
propose
to
his
own
father
,
who
,
as
hath
be
already
observe
,
stand
always
neuter
in
every
thing
that
concern
his
eld
son
;
and
as
for
Mrs
Pickle
,
she
have
never
hear
his
name
mention
since
his
departure
with
any
degree
of
temper
or
tranquillity
,
except
when
her
husband
inform
her
that
he
be
in
a
fair
way
of
be
ruin
by
this
indiscreet
amour
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
she
begin
to
applaud
her
own
foresight
,
which
have
discern
the
mark
of
reprobation
in
that
vicious
boy
,
and
launch
out
in
comparison
between
him
and
Gammy
,
who
,
she
observe
,
be
a
child
of
uncommon
part
and
solidity
,
and
with
the
blessing
of
God
,
would
be
a
comfort
to
his
parent
,
and
an
ornament
to
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
Should
I
affirm
that
this
favourite
whom
she
commend
so
much
,
be
in
every
respect
the
reverse
of
what
she
describe
;
that
he
be
a
boy
of
mean
capacity
,
and
though
remarkably
distort
in
his
body
,
much
more
crooked
in
his
disposition
;
and
that
she
have
persuade
her
husband
to
espouse
her
opinion
,
though
it
be
contrary
to
common
sense
,
as
well
as
to
his
own
perception
;
I
be
afraid
the
reader
will
think
I
represent
a
monster
that
never
exist
in
nature
,
and
be
apt
to
condemn
the
oeconomy
of
my
invention
;
nevertheless
,
there
be
nothing
more
true
than
every
circumstance
of
what
I
have
advance
;
and
I
wish
the
picture
,
singular
as
it
be
,
may
not
be
think
to
resemble
more
than
one
original
.

Peregrine

more
and
more

by
his
own
mother
;
appeal

his
father

whose
condescension

defeat
by
the
dominion
of
his

<EOS>
but
wave
these
reflection
,
let
us
return
to
Peregrine
,
who
receive
a
summon
to
attend
his
uncle
,
and
in
a
few
day
arrive
with
Mr
Jolter
and
Pipes
at
the
garrison
,
which
he
fill
with
joy
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
alteration
,
which
,
during
his
absence
,
have
happen
in
his
person
,
be
very
favourable
to
his
appearance
,
which
from
that
of
a
comely
boy
,
be
convert
into
that
of
a
most
engaging
youth
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
tall
than
a
middle
-
sized
man
,
his
shape
ascertain
,
his
sinew
well
knit
,
his
mien
greatly
improve
,
and
his
whole
figure
as
elegant
and
graceful
,
as
if
it
have
be
cast
in
the
same
mould
with
the
Apollo
of
Belvidere
.
    
<EOS>
such
an
outside
could
not
fail
of
prepossess
people
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
,
notwithstanding
the
advantageous
report
he
have
hear
,
find
his
expectation
exceed
in
the
person
of
Peregrine
,
and
signify
his
approbation
in
the
most
sanguine
term
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
be
strike
with
his
genteel
address
,
and
receive
him
with
uncommon
mark
of
complacency
and
affection
;
he
be
caress
by
all
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
while
they
admire
his
accomplishment
,
could
not
help
pity
his
infatuate
mother
,
who
be
deprive
of
that
unutterable
delight
which
any
other
parent
would
have
enjoy
in
the
contemplation
of
such
an
amiable
son
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
effort
be
make
by
some
well
-
dispose
people
,
to
conquer
,
if
possible
,
this
monstrous
prejudice
;
but
their
endeavour
,
instead
of
cure
,
serve
only
to
inflame
the
distemper
,
and
she
never
could
be
prevail
upon
to
indulge
him
in
the
least
mark
of
maternal
regard
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
her
original
disgust
degenerate
into
such
inveteracy
of
hatred
,
that
she
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
alienate
the
commodore
's
affection
for
this
her
innocent
child
,
and
even
practise
the
most
malicious
defamation
to
accomplish
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
every
day
do
she
abuse
her
husband
's
ear
with
some
forge
instance
of
Peregrine
's
ingratitude
to
his
uncle
,
<EOS>
well
know
that
it
would
reach
the
commodore
's
knowledge
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
Mr
Pickle
use
to
tell
him
at
the
club
,
that
his
hopeful
favourite
have
ridicule
him
in
such
a
company
,
and
asperse
his
spouse
upon
another
occasion
;
and
thus
retail
the
little
scandalous
issue
of
his
own
wife
's
invention
.
<EOS>
luckily
for
Peregrine
,
the
commodore
pay
no
great
regard
to
the
authority
of
his
informer
,
because
he
know
from
what
canal
his
intelligence
flow
;
besides
,
the
youth
have
a
staunch
friend
in
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
never
fail
to
vindicate
him
when
he
be
thus
unjustly
accuse
,
and
always
find
argument
enough
to
confute
the
assertion
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
trunnion
have
be
dubious
of
the
young
gentleman
's
principle
,
and
deaf
to
the
remonstrance
of
the
lieutenant
,
Perry
be
provide
with
a
bulwark
strong
enough
to
defend
him
from
all
such
assault
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
his
aunt
,
whose
regard
for
him
be
perceive
to
increase
in
the
same
proportion
as
his
own
mother
's
diminish
;
and
indeed
,
the
augmentation
of
the
one
be
,
in
all
probability
,
owe
to
the
decrease
of
the
other
;
for
the
two
lady
,
with
great
civility
,
perform
all
the
duty
of
good
neighbourhood
,
and
hate
each
other
most
piously
in
their
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Pickle
have
be
disoblige
at
the
splendor
of
her
sister
's
new
equipage
,
have
ever
since
that
time
,
in
the
course
of
her
visit
,
endeavour
to
make
people
merry
with
satirical
joke
on
that
poor
lady
's
infirmity
;
and
Mrs
Trunnion
seize
the
very
first
opportunity
of
make
reprisal
,
by
inveigh
against
her
unnatural
behaviour
to
her
own
child
;
so
that
Peregrine
,
as
on
the
one
hand
he
be
abhor
,
so
<EOS>
on
the
other
be
he
caress
in
consequence
of
this
contention
;
and
I
firmly
believe
that
the
most
effectual
method
of
destroy
his
interest
at
the
garrison
,
would
have
be
the
shew
of
countenance
him
at
his
father
's
house
:
but
,
whether
this
conjecture
be
reasonable
or
chimerical
,
certain
it
be
the
experiment
be
never
try
,
and
therefore
Mr
Peregrine
run
no
risk
of
be
disgrace
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
,
who
assume
,
and
justly
too
,
the
whole
merit
of
his
education
,
be
now
as
proud
of
the
youth
's
improvement
,
as
if
he
have
actually
be
his
own
offspring
;
and
sometimes
his
affection
rise
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
that
he
verily
believe
him
to
be
the
issue
of
his
own
loin
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
favourable
predicament
in
which
our
hero
stand
with
his
aunt
and
her
husband
,
he
could
not
help
feel
the
injury
he
suffer
from
the
caprice
of
his
mother
;
and
though
the
gaiety
of
his
disposition
hinder
him
from
afflict
himself
with
reflexion
of
any
gloomy
cast
,
he
do
not
fail
to
forsee
that
if
any
sudden
accident
should
deprive
him
of
the
commodore
,
he
would
in
all
likelihood
find
himself
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
.
<EOS>
prompt
by
this
consideration
,
he
one
evening
accompany
his
uncle
to
the
club
,
and
be
introduce
to
his
father
,
before
that
worthy
gentleman
have
the
least
inkling
of
his
arrival
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Gamaliel
be
never
so
disconcert
as
at
this
rencounter
.
<EOS>
His
own
disposition
would
not
suffer
him
to
do
any
thing
that
may
create
the
least
disturbance
,
or
interrupt
his
evening
's
enjoyment
;
and
so
strongly
be
he
impressed
with
the
terror
of
his
wife
,
that
he
durst
not
yield
to
the
tranquillity
of
his
temper
:
and
,
as
I
have
already
observe
,
his
inclination
be
perfectly
neutral
.
<EOS>
thus
distract
between
different
motive
,
when
Perry
be
present
to
him
,
he
sit
silent
and
absorpt
,
as
if
he
do
not
or
would
not
perceive
the
application
;
and
when
he
be
urge
to
declare
himself
by
the
youth
,
who
pathetically
beg
to
know
how
he
have
incur
his
displeasure
,
he
answer
in
a
peevish
strain
,
"
why
,
good
now
,
child
,
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
your
mother
can
not
abide
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
my
mother
be
so
unkind
,
I
will
not
call
it
unnatural
,
(
say
Peregrine
,
the
tear
of
indignation
start
from
his
eye
)
<EOS>
as
to
banish
me
from
her
presence
and
affection
,
without
the
least
cause
assign
;
I
hope
you
will
not
be
so
unjust
as
to
espouse
her
barbarous
prejudice
.
"
<EOS>
before
Mr
Pickle
have
time
to
reply
to
this
expostulation
,
for
which
he
be
not
at
all
prepare
,
the
commodore
interpose
,
and
enforce
his
favourite
's
remonstrance
,
by
tell
Mr
Gamaliel
that
he
be
ashamed
to
see
any
man
drive
in
such
a
miserable
manner
under
his
wife
's
petticoat
.
"
    
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
(
say
he
,
raise
his
voice
,
and
assume
a
look
of
importance
and
command
)
before
I
would
suffer
myself
to
be
steer
all
weather
by
any
woman
in
Christendom
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
I
would
raise
such
a
hurricane
about
her
ear
that
"
 
here
he
be
interrupt
by
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
thrust
his
head
towards
the
door
,
in
the
attitude
of
one
that
listen
,
cry
"
Ahey
!
<EOS>
there
be
your
spouse
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
trunnion
's
feature
that
instant
adopt
a
new
disposition
:
fear
and
confusion
take
possession
of
his
countenance
;
his
voice
from
a
tone
of
vociferation
sink
into
a
whisper
of
"
sure
you
must
be
mistake
,
Jack
;
"
and
in
great
perplexity
he
wipe
off
the
sweat
which
have
start
on
his
forehead
at
this
false
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
have
thus
punish
him
for
the
rhodomontade
he
have
utter
,
tell
him
with
an
arch
sneer
,
that
he
be
deceive
by
the
sound
of
the
outward
door
creak
upon
its
hinge
,
which
he
mistake
for
Mrs
Trunnion
's
voice
,
and
desire
him
to
proceed
with
his
admonition
to
Mr
Pickle
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
deny
that
this
arrogance
be
a
little
unseasonable
in
the
commodore
,
who
be
in
all
respect
as
effectually
subdue
to
the
dominion
of
his
wife
,
as
the
person
whose
submission
he
then
venture
to
condemn
;
with
this
difference
of
disposition
:
trunnion
's
subjection
be
like
that
of
a
bear
,
chequer
with
fit
of
surliness
and
rage
;
whereas
Pickle
bear
the
yoke
like
an
ox
,
without
repine
.
    
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
that
this
indolence
,
this
sluggishness
,
this
stagnation
of
temper
,
render
Gamaliel
incapable
of
withstand
the
argument
and
importunity
of
his
friend
,
to
which
he
at
length
surrender
,
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of
their
observation
,
and
take
his
son
by
the
hand
,
promise
to
favour
him
for
the
future
with
his
love
and
fatherly
protection
.
    
<EOS>
but
this
laudable
resolution
do
not
last
;
Mrs
Pickle
still
dubious
of
his
constancy
,
and
jealous
of
his
communication
with
the
commodore
,
never
fail
to
interrogate
him
every
night
about
the
conversation
that
happen
at
the
club
;
and
regulate
her
exhortation
accord
to
the
intelligence
she
receive
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
safely
convey
to
bed
,
(
that
academy
in
which
all
notable
wife
communicate
their
lecture
)
when
her
catechism
begin
;
and
she
in
a
moment
perceive
something
reluctant
and
equivocal
in
her
husband
's
answer
.
<EOS>
arrouse
at
this
discovery
,
she
employ
her
influence
and
skill
with
such
success
,
that
he
disclose
every
circumstance
of
what
have
happen
;
and
after
have
sustain
a
most
severe
rebuke
for
his
simplicity
and
indiscretion
,
humble
himself
so
far
as
to
promise
that
he
would
next
day
annul
the
condescension
he
have
make
,
and
for
ever
renounce
the
ungracious
object
of
her
disgust
.
<EOS>
this
undertaking
be
punctually
perform
in
a
letter
to
the
commodore
,
which
she
herself
dictate
in
these
word
.
     
<EOS>
Sir
,
whereas
my
good

nature
be
last

I
be
persuade
to
countenance
and
promise
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
that
vicious
youth
,
whose
parent
I
have
the
misfortune
to
be
;
I
desire
you
will
take
notice
that
I
revoke
all
such
countenance
and
promise
,
and
shall
never
look
upon
that

Chapter
XXIV
Trunnion
be
enrage
at
the
conduct
of
Pickle
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
resent
the
injustice
of
his
mother
,
to
whom
he
explain
his
sentiment
in
a
letter
.
<EOS>
be
enter
at
the
University
of
Oxford
,
where
he
signalize
himself
as
a
youth
of
an
enterprising
genius
.
   
<EOS>
unspeakable
be
the
transport
of
rage
to
which
trunnion
be
incense
by
this
absurd
renunciation
:
he
tear
the
letter
with
his
gum
,
(
<EOS>
tooth
he
have
none
)
<EOS>
spit
with
furious
grimace
,
in
token
of
the
contempt
he
entertain
for
the
author
,
whom
he
not
only
damn
as
a
lousy
,
scabby
,
nasty
,
scurvy
,
sculking
,
lubberly
noodle
,
but
resolve
to
challenge
to
single
combat
with
fire
and
sword
;
but
he
be
dissuade
from
this
violent
measure
,
and
appease
by
the
intervention
and
advice
of
the
lieutenant
and
Mr
Jolter
,
who
represent
the
message
as
the
effect
of
the
poor
man
's
infirmity
,
for
which
he
be
rather
an
object
of
pity
than
of
resentment
;
and
turn
the
stream
of
his
indignation
against
the
wife
,
whom
he
revile
accordingly
.
<EOS>
nor
do
Peregrine
himself
bear
with
patience
this
injurious
declaration
,
the
nature
of
which
he
no
sooner
understand
from
Hatchway
,
than
equally
shock
and
exasperate
,
he
retire
to
his
apartment
,
and
in
the
first
emotion
of
his
ire
,
produce
the
follow
epistle
,
which
be
immediately
convey
to
his
mother
.
     
<EOS>
Madam
,
have
nature
form
me
a
bugbear
to
the
fight
,
and
inspire
me
with
a
soul
as
vicious
as
my
body
be
detestable
,
perhaps
I
may
have
enjoy
particular
mark
of
your
affection
and
applause
;
see
you
have
persecute
me
with
such
unnatural
aversion
,
for
no
other
visible
reason
than
that
of
my
differ
so
widely
in
shape
as
well
as
disposition
,
from
that
deform
urchin
who
be
the
object
of
your
tenderness
and
care
.
<EOS>
if
those
be
the
term
on
which
alone
I
can
obtain
your
favour
,
I
pray
God
you
may
never
cease
to
hate
,
Madam
,
Your
most
injured
son
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
this
letter
,
which
nothing
but
his
passion
and
inexperience
could
excuse
,
have
such
an
effect
upon
his
mother
,
as
may
be
easily
conceive
.
<EOS>
She
be
enrage
to
a
degree
of
frenzy
against
the
writer
;
though
at
the
same
time
she
consider
the
whole
as
the
production
of
Mrs
Trunnion
's
particular
pique
,
and
represent
it
to
her
husband
as
an
insult
,
that
he
be
bind
in
honour
to
resent
,
by
break
off
all
correspondence
with
the
commodore
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
bitter
pill
to
Gamaliel
,
who
,
through
a
long
course
of
year
,
be
so
habituated
to
Trunnion
's
company
,
that
he
could
as
easily
have
part
with
a
limb
,
as
have
relinquish
the
club
all
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
venture
to
represent
his
own
incapacity
to
follow
her
advice
,
and
beg
that
he
may
at
least
be
allow
to
drop
the
connexion
gradually
;
protest
that
he
would
do
his
endeavour
to
give
her
all
manner
of
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
preparation
be
make
for
Peregrine
's
departure
to
the
university
,
and
in
a
few
week
he
set
out
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
his
age
,
accompany
by
the
same
attendant
who
live
with
him
at
Winchester
,
after
his
uncle
have
lay
strong
injunction
upon
him
to
avoid
the
company
of
modest
woman
,
to
mind
his
learning
,
to
let
him
hear
of
his
welfare
as
often
as
he
could
spare
time
to
write
,
and
have
settle
his
appointment
at
the
rate
of
five
hundred
a
year
,
include
his
governor
's
salary
,
which
be
one
fifth
part
of
the
sum
.
<EOS>
the
heart
of
our
young
gentleman
dilate
at
the
prospect
of
the
figure
he
should
make
with
such
an
handsome
annuity
,
the
management
of
which
be
leave
to
his
own
discretion
;
and
he
amuse
his
imagination
with
the
most
agreeable
reverie
during
his
journey
to
Oxford
,
which
he
perform
in
two
day
.
<EOS>
here
be
introduce
to
the
head
of
the
college
,
to
whom
he
have
be
recommend
,
accommodate
with
genteel
apartment
,
enter
as
gentleman
commoner
in
the
book
,
and
provide
with
a
judicious
tutor
,
instead
of
return
to
the
study
of
Greek
and
Latin
,
in
which
he
think
himself
already
sufficiently
instructed
;
he
renew
his
acquaintance
with
some
of
his
old
school
-
fellow
,
whom
he
find
in
the
same
situation
,
and
be
by
them
initiate
in
all
the
fashionable
diversion
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
he
make
himself
remarkable
for
his
spirit
and
humour
,
which
be
so
acceptable
to
the
buck
of
the
university
,
that
he
be
admit
as
a
member
of
their
corporation
,
and
in
a
very
little
time
become
the
most
conspicuous
personage
of
the
whole
fraternity
;
not
that
he
value
himself
upon
his
ability
in
smoake
the
great
number
of
pipe
,
and
drink
the
large
quantity
of
ale
;
these
be
qualification
of
too
gross
a
nature
to
captivate
his
refined
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
pique
himself
on
his
talent
for
raillery
,
his
genius
and
taste
,
his
personal
accomplishment
,
and
his
success
at
intrigue
;
nor
be
his
excursion
confine
to
the
small
village
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
be
commonly
visit
once
a
week
by
the
student
for
the
sake
of
carnal
recreation
.
<EOS>
He
keep
his
own
horse
,
traverse
the
whole
country
in
party
of
pleasure
,
attend
all
the
race
within
fifty
mile
of
Oxford
,
and
make
frequent
jaunt
to
London
,
where
he
use
to
lie
incognito
during
the
good
part
of
many
a
term
.
    
<EOS>
the
rule
of
the
university
be
too
severe
to
be
observe
by
a
youth
of
his
vivacity
;
and
therefore
he
become
acquaint
with
the
proctor
,
by
time
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
check
he
receive
be
insufficient
to
moderate
his
career
;
he
frequent
tavern
and
coffee
-
house
,
commit
midnight
frolic
in
the
street
,
insult
all
the
sober
and
pacific
class
of
his
fellow
-
student
;
the
tutor
themselves
be
not
sacred
from
his
ridicule
;
he
laugh
at
the
magistrate
,
and
neglect
every
particular
of
college
-
discipline
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
they
attempt
to
restrain
his
irregularity
by
the
imposition
of
fine
;
he
be
liberal
to
profusion
,
and
therefore
pay
without
reluctance
.
    
<EOS>
Thrice
<EOS>
do
he
scale
the
window
of
a
tradesman
,
with
whose
daughter
he
have
an
affair
of
gallantry
,
as
often
be
he
oblige
to
seek
his
safety
by
a
precipitate
leap
;
and
one
night
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
an
ambuscade
that
be
lay
by
the
father
,
have
not
his
trusty
squire
Pipes
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
and
manfully
rescue
him
from
the
club
of
his
enemy
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
excess
,
Mr
Jolter
find
his
admonition
neglect
,
and
his
influence
utterly
destroy
,
attempt
to
wean
his
pupil
from
his
extravagant
course
,
by
engage
his
attention
in
some
more
laudable
pursuit
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
introduce
him
into
a
club
of
politician
,
who
receive
him
with
great
demonstration
of
regard
,
accommodate
themselves
more
than
he
could
have
expect
to
his
jovial
disposition
,
and
while
they
revolve
scheme
for
the
reformation
of
the
state
,
drink
with
such
devotion
to
the
accomplishment
of
their
plan
,
that
before
part
the
care
of
their
patriotism
be
quite
overwhelmed
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
could
not
approve
of
their
doctrine
,
resolve
to
attach
himself
for
some
time
to
their
company
;
because
he
perceive
ample
subject
for
his
ridicule
,
in
the
character
of
these
wrong
-
head
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
constant
practice
with
them
,
in
their
midnight
consistory
,
to
swallow
such
plentiful
draught
of
inspiration
,
that
their
mystery
commonly
end
like
those
of
the
bacchanalian
Orgia
;
and
they
be
seldom
capable
of
maintain
that
solemnity
of
decorum
which
by
the
nature
of
their
function
most
of
them
be
oblige
to
profess
.
<EOS>
now
as
Peregrine
's
satirical
disposition
be
never
more
gratified
than
when
he
have
an
opportunity
of
expose
grave
character
in
ridiculous
attitude
,
he
lay
a
mischievous
snare
for
his
new
confederate
,
which
take
effect
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
in
one
of
their
nocturnal
deliberation
,
he
promote
such
a
spirit
of
good
fellowship
,
by
the
agreeable
sally
of
his
wit
,
which
be
purposely
level
against
their
political
adversary
,
that
by
ten
o'clock
they
be
all
ready
to
join
in
the
most
extravagant
proposal
that
could
be
make
.
<EOS>
They
have
already
break
their
glass
in
consequence
of
his
suggestion
,
drink
health
out
of
their
shoe
,
cap
,
and
the
bottom
of
the
candlestick
that
stand
before
them
,
sometimes
stand
with
one
foot
on
a
chair
,
and
the
knee
bent
on
the
edge
of
the
table
;
and
when
they
could
no
longer
stand
in
that
posture
,
set
their
bare
posterior
on
the
cold
floor
,
they
huzza'd
,
hollow
,
dance
and
sing
,
and
in
short
be
elevate
to
such
a
pitch
of
intoxication
,
that
when
Peregrine
propose
that
they
should
burn
their
perriwig
,
the
hint
be
immediately
approve
,
and
they
execute
the
frolick
as
one
man
;
their
shoe
and
cap
undergo
the
same
fate
by
the
same
instigation
,
and
in
this
trim
he
lead
them
forth
into
the
street
,
where
they
resolve
to
compel
every
body
they
should
find
to
subscribe
to
their
political
creed
,
and
pronounce
the
Shiboleth
of
their
party
.
<EOS>
in
the
atchievement
of
this
enterprize
,
they
meet
with
more
opposition
than
they
expect
;
they
be
encounter
with
argument
which
they
could
not
well
withstand
;
the
nose
of
some
,
and
eye
of
other
,
in
a
very
little
time
bear
the
mark
of
obstinate
disputation
;
and
their
conductor
have
at
length
engage
the
whole
body
in
a
fray
with
another
squadron
which
be
pretty
much
in
the
same
condition
,
he
very
fairly
give
them
the
slip
,
and
slyly
retreat
to
his
apartment
,
foresee
that
his
companion
would
soon
be
favour
with
the
notice
of
their
superior
.
    
<EOS>
nor
be
he
deceive
in
his
prognostic
;
the
proctor
go
his
round
,
chance
to
fall
in
with
this
tumultuous
uproar
,
and
interpose
his
authority
,
find
mean
to
quiet
the
disturbance
,
and
,
after
have
take
cognizance
of
their
name
,
dismiss
the
rioter
to
their
respective
chamber
,
not
a
little
scandalized
at
the
behaviour
of
some
among
them
,
whose
business
and
duty
it
be
to
set
far
other
example
to
the
youth
under
their
care
and
direction
.
    
<EOS>
about
midnight
Pipes
,
who
have
order
to
attend
at
a
distance
,
and
keep
an
eye
upon
Jolter
,
bring
home
that
unfortunate
governor
upon
his
back
<EOS>
(
Peregrine
have
beforehand
secure
his
admittance
into
the
college
)
and
among
other
bruise
,
he
be
find
to
have
receive
a
couple
of
contusion
on
his
face
,
which
next
morning
appear
in
a
black
circle
that
surround
each
eye
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
mortify
circumstance
to
a
man
of
his
character
and
deportment
,
especially
as
he
have
receive
a
message
from
the
proctor
,
who
desire
to
see
him
forthwith
.
<EOS>
with
great
humility
and
contrition
he
beg
the
advice
of
his
pupil
,
who
be
use
to
amuse
himself
with
painting
,
assure
Mr
Jolter
,
that
he
would
cover
those
sign
of
disgrace
with
a
slight
coat
of
flesh
-
colour
,
so
dextrously
,
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
the
artificial
from
the
natural
skin
.
    
<EOS>
the
rueful
governor
,
rather
than
expose
such
opprobrious
token
to
the
observation
and
censure
of
the
magistrate
,
submit
to
the
expedient
;
and
although
his
counsellor
have
over
-
rate
his
own
skill
,
be
persuade
to
confide
in
the
disguise
,
and
actually
attend
the
proctor
,
with
such
a
stare
addition
to
the
natural
ghastliness
of
his
feature
,
that
his
visage
bear
a
very
apt
resemblance
to
some
of
those
ferocious
countenance
that
hang
over
the
door
of
certain
tavern
and
alehouse
,
under
the
denomination
of
the
Saracen
's
head
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
remarkable
alteration
of
phisiognomy
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
most
undiscerning
beholder
,
much
less
the
penetrate
eye
of
this
severe
judge
,
already
whet
with
what
he
have
see
over
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
upbraided
with
his
ridiculous
and
shallow
artifice
,
and
,
together
with
the
companion
of
his
debauch
,
undergo
such
a
cut
reprimand
for
the
scandalous
irregularity
of
his
conduct
,
that
all
of
them
remain
crest
-
fall
,
and
be
ashamed
,
for
many
week
,
to
appear
in
the
publick
execution
of
their
duty
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
too
vain
of
his
finesse
,
to
conceal
the
part
he
act
in
this
comedy
,
with
the
particular
of
which
he
regale
his
companion
,
and
thereby
intaile
upon
himself
the
hate
and
resentment
of
the
community
,
whose
maxim
and
practice
he
have
disclose
;
for
he
be
consider
as
a
spy
,
who
have
intrude
himself
into
their
society
with
a
view
of
betray
it
;
or
,
at
best
,
an
apostate
and
renegado
from
the
faith
and
principle
which
he
have
profess

Chapter

He
be
insult
by
his
tutor
,
whom
he
lampoon
;
make
considerable
progress
in
polite
literature
;
and
in
an
excursion
to
Windsor
meet
with
Emilia
by
accident
,
and
be
very
coldly
receive
.
   
<EOS>
among
those
who
suffer
by
his
craft
and
infidelity
be
Mr
Jumble
his
own
tutor
,
who
could
not
at
all
digest
the
mortifying
affront
he
have
receive
,
and
be
resolve
to
be
revenge
on
the
insulting
author
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
watch
the
conduct
of
Mr
Pickle
with
the
utmost
rancour
of
vigilance
,
and
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
treat
him
with
disrespect
,
which
he
know
the
disposition
of
his
pupil
could
less
brook
than
any
other
severity
it
be
in
his
power
to
exercise
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
have
be
several
morning
absent
from
chapel
;
and
as
Mr
Jumble
never
fail
to
question
him
in
a
very
peremptory
stile
about
his
non
-
attendance
,
he
invent
some
very
plausible
excuse
;
but
,
at
length
,
his
ingenuity
be
exhaust
;
he
receive
a
very
gall
rebuke
for
his
profligacy
of
moral
,
and
that
he
may
feel
it
the
more
sensibly
,
be
order
,
by
way
of
exercise
,
to
compose
a
paraphrase
in
english
verse
,
upon
these
two
line
in
Virgil
,
Vane

<EOS>
the
imposition
of
this
invidious
theme
have
all
the
desire
effect
upon
Peregrine
,
who
not
only
consider
it
as
a
piece
of
unmannerly
abuse
level
against
his
own
conduct
,
but
also
as
a
retrospective
insult
on
the
memory
of
his
grandfather
,
who
(
as
he
have
be
inform
)
be
in
his
life
-
time
more
note
for
his
cunning
than
candour
in
trade
.
    
<EOS>
Exasperated
at
this
instance
of
the
pedant
's
audacity
,
he
have
well
nigh
(
in
his
first
transport
)
take
corporal
satisfaction
on
the
spot
;
but
foresee
the
troublesome
consequence
that
would
attend
such
a
flagrant
outrage
against
the
law
of
the
university
,
he
check
his
indignation
,
and
resolve
to
revenge
the
injury
in
a
more
cool
and
contemptuous
manner
.
<EOS>
thus
determined
,
he
set
on
foot
an
inquiry
into
the
particular
of
Jumble
's
parentage
and
education
,
and
learn
that
the
father
of
this
insolent
tutor
be
a
bricklayer
,
and
that
his
mother
sell
pie
,
and
that
the
son
,
at
different
period
of
his
youth
,
have
amuse
himself
in
both
occupation
,
before
he
convert
his
view
to
the
study
of
learn
.
<EOS>
fraught
with
this
intelligence
,
he
compose
the
follow
ballad
in
doggerel
rhyme
,
and
next
day
present
it
as
a
gloss
upon
the
text
which
the
tutor
have
choose
.

a

profound
,
a

,
<EOS>
in

,
a
meer
jumble
of
learning
and
sense
;
and
yet
of
his
talent
,
tho
'
laudably
vain
,
His

he
could
never
attain
.
    
<EOS>

<EOS>
His
father
intend
his
fortune
to
build
,
in
his
youth
would
have
teach
him
the
trowel
to
wield
,
but
the
mortar
of
discipline
never
would
stick
,
for
his
skull
be
secur'd
by
a
facing
of
brick
,
and
with
all
his

of

,
the

His

soon
alter'd

his

by
flatt're
his
taste
,
from
the
raising
of

to
the
rearing
of

;
but
all
her

fruitless
and
vain

<EOS>
yet
true
to
his

in
his

be

of

their

<EOS>
I

his

His
pie
seem'd

and
his

<EOS>
then
,
good
Mr
Tutor
,
pray
be
not
so
vain
,
since
your
family
art
you
could
never
attain
.
    
<EOS>
this
impudent
production
be
the
most
effectual
vengeance
he
could
have
take
on
his
tutor
,
who
have
all
the
supercilious
arrogance
and
ridiculous
pride
of
a
low
-
bear
pedant
.
<EOS>
instead
of
overlook
this
petulant
piece
of
satire
with
that
temper
and
decency
of
disdain
that
become
a
person
of
his
gravity
and
station
,
he
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
over
the
performance
,
than
the
blood
rush
into
his
countenance
,
which
immediately
after
exhibit
a
ghastly
pale
colour
,
and
with
a
quivering
lip
he
tell
his
pupil
that
he
be
an
impertinent
jackanapes
,
and
he
would
take
care
that
he
should
be
expel
from
the
university
,
for
have
presume
to
write
and
deliver
such
a
licentious
and
scurrilous
libel
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
answer
with
great
resolution
,
that
when
the
provocation
he
have
receive
should
be
know
,
he
be
persuade
that
he
should
be
acquit
by
the
opinion
of
all
impartial
people
;
and
that
he
be
ready
to
submit
the
whole
to
the
decision
of
the
master
.
    
<EOS>
this
arbitration
he
propose
,
because
he
know
the
master
and
Jumble
be
at
variance
;
and
for
that
reason
the
tutor
durst
not
venture
to
put
the
cause
on
such
an
issue
.
<EOS>
nay
,
when
this
reference
be
mention
,
Jumble
,
who
be
naturally
jealous
,
suspect
that
Peregrine
have
a
promise
of
protection
before
he
undertake
to
commit
such
an
outrageous
insult
;
and
this
notion
have
such
an
effect
upon
him
,
that
he
resolve
to
devour
his
vexation
,
and
wait
for
a
more
proper
opportunity
of
gratify
his
hate
.
<EOS>
mean
while
copy
of
the
ballad
be
distribute
among
the
student
,
who
sing
it
under
the
very
nose
of
Mr
Jumble
,
to
the
tune
of
a
Cobler
there
be
,
&
c.
and
the
triumph
of
our
hero
be
compleat
.
<EOS>
neither
be
his
whole
time
devote
to
the
riotous
extravagancy
of
youth
.
<EOS>
He
enjoy
many
lucid
interval
,
during
which
he
contract
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
classick
,
apply
himself
to
the
reading
of
history
,
improve
his
taste
for
painting
and
musick
,
in
which
he
make
some
progress
;
and
above
all
thing
,
cultivate
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
after
a
course
of
close
attention
to
some
of
these
art
and
science
,
that
his
disposition
break
out
into
those
irregularity
and
wild
sally
of
a
luxuriant
imagination
,
for
which
he
become
so
remarkable
;
and
he
be
perhaps
the
only
young
man
in
Oxford
,
who
at
the
same
time
maintain
an
intimate
and
friendly
intercourse
with
the
most
unthinking
,
as
well
as
with
the
most
sedate
student
at
the
university
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
a
young
man
of
Peregrine
's
vanity
,
inexperience
and
profusion
,
could
suit
his
expence
to
his
allowance
,
liberal
as
it
be
;
for
he
be
not
one
of
those
fortunate
people
who
be
bear
oeconomist
,
and
know
not
the
art
of
with
-
hold
his
purse
when
he
see
his
companion
in
difficulty
:
thus
naturally
generous
and
expensive
,
he
squander
away
his
money
,
and
make
a
most
splendid
appearance
upon
the
receipt
of
his
quarterly
appointment
;
but
long
before
the
third
month
be
elapse
,
his
finance
be
consume
,
and
as
he
could
not
stoop
to
ask
an
extraordinary
supply
,
be
too
proud
to
borrow
,
and
too
haughty
to
run
in
debt
with
tradesman
,
he
devote
those
period
of
poverty
to
the
prosecution
of
his
study
,
and
shine
forth
again
at
the
revolution
of
quarter
day
.
    
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
irruption
he
and
some
of
his
companion
go
to
Windsor
,
in
order
to
see
the
royal
apartment
in
the
castle
,
whither
they
repair
in
the
afternoon
,
and
as
Peregrine
stand
contemplate
the
picture
of
Hercules
and
Omphale
,
one
of
his
fellow
-
student
whisper
in
his
ear
,
"
Z####ds

<EOS>
Pickle
,
there
be
two
fine

"
<EOS>
He
turn
instantly
about
,
and
in
one
of
them
recognize
his
almost
forget
Emilia
:
her
appearance
act
upon
his
imagination
like
a
spark
of
fire
that
fall
among
gun
-
powder
;
that
passion
which
have
lie
dormant
for
the
space
of
two
year
flash
up
in
a
moment
,
and
he
be
seize
with
an
universal
trepidation
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
and
partook
of
his
emotion
;
for
their
soul
,
like
unison
,
vibrate
with
the
same
impulse
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
call
her
pride
and
resentment
to
her
aid
,
and
find
resolution
enough
to
retire
from
such
a
dangerous
scene
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
her
retreat
,
he
recollect
all
his
assurance
,
and
impel
by
love
which
he
could
no
longer
resist
,
follow
her
into
the
next
room
,
where
in
the
most
disconcerted
manner
he
accost
her
with

<EOS>
by
this
time
his
companion
see
him
engage
with
one
of
the
lady
,
enter
into
conversation
with
the
other
;
and
in
order
to
favour
his
friend

gallantry

conduct
her
into
the
next
apartment

on
pretence
of
entertain
her
with
the

remarkable
piece

<EOS>
Peregrine
lay
hold
on
this
opportunity
of

alone

object
of

a
most
seducing
tenderness

profound
sigh

imagine
slight

put
upon

she
answer
in
great
confusion

"
Sir

I

<EOS>
"
Miss

<EOS>
"
Mr

,
she
reply
in
the
same
tone
,
it
be
neither
my
province
nor
inclination
to
judge
your
conduct
;
and
therefore
you
misapply
your
question
when
you
ask
such
an
explanation
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
at
least
,
resume
our
lover
,
give
me
the
melancholy
satisfaction
to
know

offence

you
refuse

Your

say
Miss
with
great
vivacity

neither
require

deserve
an
answer
;
and
to
be
free
with
you
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
,
it
be
but
a
shallow
artifice
to
rid
yourself
of
a
correspondence
you
have
deign
to
sollicit

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Peregrine
confound
at
this
repartee
,
reply
that
howsoever
he
may
have
fail
in
point
of
elegance
or
discretion
,
he
be
sure
he
have
not
be
deficient
in
expression
of
respect
and
devotion
for
those
charm
which
it
be
his
pride

adore

"
<EOS>
as
for
the
verse
,
say
he
,
I
own
they
be
unworthy
of
the
theme
,
but
I
flatter
myself
that
they
would
have
merit
your
acceptance
,
though
not
your
approbation
,

be
consider
not
so
much

"
<EOS>
"
verse
?
<EOS>
cry
Emilia
with
an
air
of
astonishment
,
<EOS>
what
verse
?
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
understand
you
.
"
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
be
thunderstruck
at
this
exclamation
,
to
which
,
after
a
long
pause
,
he
answer
,
"
I
begin
to
suspect
,
and
heartily
wish
it
may
appear
that
we
have
misunderstood
each
other
from
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
Miss
Gauntlet
,
do
not
you
find
a
copy
of
verse
inclose
in
that
unfortunate
letter
?
"
<EOS>
"
truly
,
Sir
,
(
say
the
lady
)
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
much
of
a
connoiseur
as
to
distinguish
whether
that
facetious
production
which
you
merrily
stile
an
unfortunate
letter
be
compose
in
verse
or
prose
;
but
,
methink
,
the
jest
be
a
little
too
stale
to
be
bring
upon
the
carpet
again
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
trip
away
to
her
companion
,
and
leave
her
lover
in
a
most
tumultuous
suspence
.
<EOS>
He
now
perceive
that
her
neglect
of
his
address
when
he
be
at
Winchester
,
must
have
be
owe
to
some
mystery
which
he
could
not
comprehend
;
and
she
begin
to
suspect
and
to
hope
that
the
letter
which
she
receive
be
spurious
,
though
she
could
not
conceive
how
that
could
possibly
happen
,
as
it
have
be
deliver
to
her
by
the
hand
of
his
own
servant
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
she
resolve
to
leave
the
task
of
unravel
the
affair
,
to
him
who
,
she
know
,
would
infallibly
exert
himself
for
his
own
as
well
as
her
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
She
be
not
deceive
in
her
opinion
;
he
go
up
to
her
again
at
the
staircase
,
and
as
they
be
unprovided
with
a
male
attendant
,
insist
upon
squire
the
lady
to
their
lodging
.
<EOS>
Emilia
see
his
drift
,
which
be
no
other
than
to
know
where
she
live
;
and
though
she
approve
of
his
finesse
,
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
her
for
the
support
of
her
own
dignity
to
decline
his
civility
:
she
therefore
thank
him
for
his
polite
offer
,
but
would
by
no
means
consent
to
his
give
himself
such
unnecessary
trouble
,
especially
as
they
have
a
very
little
way
to
walk
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
repulse
by
this
refusal
,
the
nature
of
which
he
perfectly
understand
;
nor
be
she
sorry
to
see
him
persevere
in
his
determination
;
he
therefore
accompany
them
in
their
return
,
and
make
diver
effort
to
speak
with
Emilia
in
particular
:
but
she
have
a
spice
of
the
coquette
in
her
disposition
,
and
be
determine
to
whet
his
impatience
,
artfully
baffle
all
his
endeavour
,
by
keep
her
companion
continually
engage
in
the
conversation
,
which
turn
upon
the
venerable
appearance
and
imperial
situation
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
thus
tantalize
,
he
lounge
with
them
to
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
they
lodge
,
when
his
mistress
perceive
by
the
countenance
of
her
comrade
,
that
she
be
on
the
point
of
desire
him
to
walk
in
,
check
her
intention
with
a
frown
,
then
turn
to
Mr
Pickle
,
drop
him
a
very
formal
curt'sey
,
seize
the
other
young
lady
by
the
arm
,
and
say
"
come
,
cousin
Sophy
,
"
vanish
in
a
moment
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXVI
<EOS>
after
sundry
unsuccessful
effort
,
he
find
mean
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
his
mistress
;
and
a
reconciliation
ensue
.
   
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
disconcert
at
their
sudden
disappearance
,
stand
for
some
minute
gap
in
the
street
,
before
he
could
get
the
well
of
his
surprize
;
and
then
deliberate
with
himself
whether
he
should
demand
immediate
admittance
to
his
mistress
,
or
choose
some
other
method
of
application
.
<EOS>
pique
at
her
abrupt
behaviour
,
though
pleased
with
her
spirit
,
he
set
his
invention
to
work
,
in
order
to
contrive
some
mean
of
see
her
;
and
in
a
fit
of
musing
arrive
at
the
inn
,
where
he
find
his
companion
whom
he
have
leave
at
the
Castle
-
gate
.
<EOS>
They
have
already
make
inquiry
about
the
lady
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
learn
that
Miss
Sophy
be
daughter
of
a
gentleman
in
town
to
whom
his
mistress
be
relate
;
that
an
intimate
friendship
subsist
between
the
two
young
lady
;
that
Emilia
have
live
about
a
month
with
her
cousin
,
and
appear
at
the
last
assembly
,
where
she
be
universally
admire
;
and
that
several
young
gentleman
of
fortune
have
since
that
time
teize
her
with
address
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
ambition
be
flatter
,
and
his
passion
inflame
with
this
intelligence
;
and
he
swear
within
himself
that
he
would
not
quit
the
spot
until
he
should
have
obtain
an
indispute
victory
over
all
his
rival
.
    
<EOS>
that
same
evening
he
compose
a
most
eloquent
epistle
,
in
which
he
earnestly
intreate
that
she
would
favour
him
with
an
opportunity
of
vindicate
his
conduct
;
but
she
would
neither
receive
his
billet
nor
see
his
messenger
.
<EOS>
baulk
in
this
effort
,
he
inclose
it
in
a
new
cover
direct
by
another
hand
,
and
order
pipe
to
ride
next
morning
to
London
,
on
purpose
to
deliver
it
at
the
post
-
office
;
that
come
by
such
conveyance
,
she
may
have
no
suspicion
of
the
author
,
and
open
it
before
she
should
be
aware
of
the
deceit
.
    
<EOS>
three
day
he
wait
patiently
for
the
effect
of
this
stratagem
,
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
,
venture
to
hazard
a
formal
visit
,
in
quality
of
an
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
but
here
too
he
fail
in
his
attempt
;
she
be
indispose
and
could
not
see
company
.
<EOS>
these
obstacle
serve
only
to
increase
his
eagerness
;
he
still
adhere
to
his
former
resolution
;
and
his
companion
understand
his
determination
,
leave
him
next
day
to
his
own
invention
.
<EOS>
thus
relinquish
to
his
own
idea
,
he
double
his
assiduity
,
and
practise
every
method
his
imagination
could
suggest
,
in
order
to
promote
his
plan
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
be
station
all
day
long
within
sight
of
her
door
,
that
he
may
be
able
to
give
his
master
an
account
of
her
motion
;
but
she
never
go
abroad
except
to
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
be
always
house
before
Peregrine
could
be
apprize
of
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
church
with
a
view
of
attract
her
notice
,
and
humble
his
deportment
before
her
;
but
she
be
so
mischievously
devout
as
to
look
at
nothing
but
her
book
,
so
that
he
be
not
favour
with
one
glance
of
regard
.
    
<EOS>
He
frequent
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
attempt
to
contract
an
acquaintance
with
Miss
Sophy
's
father
,
who
,
he
hope
,
would
invite
him
to
his
house
;
this
expectation
be
also
defeat
.
<EOS>
the
prudent
gentleman
look
upon
him
as
one
of
those
forward
fortune
-
hunter
who
go
about
the
country
seek
whom
they
may
devour
,
and
warily
discourage
all
his
advance
.
<EOS>
chagrin
by
so
many
unsuccessful
endeavour
,
he
begin
to
despair
of
accomplish
his
aim
,
and
as
the
last
suggestion
of
his
art
,
pay
off
his
lodging
,
take
horse
at
noon
,
and
depart
,
in
all
appearance
,
for
the
place
from
whence
he
have
come
.
<EOS>
He
ride
,
however
,
but
a
few
mile
,
and
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
return
unseen
,
alight
at
another
inn
,
order
Pipes
to
stay
within
door
,
and
keep
himself
incognito
,
employ
another
person
as
a
centinel
upon
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
he
reap
the
fruit
of
his
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
next
day
in
the
afternoon
he
be
inform
by
his
spy
,
that
the
two
young
lady
be
go
to
walk
in
the
park
,
whither
he
follow
them
on
the
instant
,
fully
determined
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
his
mistress
,
even
in
presence
of
her
friend
,
who
may
possibly
be
prevail
upon
to
interest
herself
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
see
them
at
such
a
distance
that
they
could
not
return
to
town
before
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
put
his
resolution
in
practice
,
he
mend
his
pace
,
and
find
mean
to
appear
before
them
so
suddenly
,
that
Emilia
could
not
help
express
her
surprize
in
a
scream
.
<EOS>
Our
lover
put
on
a
mein
of
humility
and
mortification
,
beg
to
know
if
her
resentment
be
implacable
;
and
ask
why
she
have
so
cruelly
refuse
to
grant
him
the
common
privilege
that
every
criminal
enjoy
.
    
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Sophy
,

he

himself
to

to
perceive
that
this
be
a
love
-
quarrel
,
and
therefore
there
may
be
hope
of
a
reconciliation
;
for
I
suppose
both
party
be
open
to
conviction
.
"
<EOS>
"
for
my
own
part
,
(
cry
Peregrine
with
great
eagerness
)
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
Miss
Sophy
's
decision
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
say
appeal
?
<EOS>
tho
<EOS>
'
I
be
conscious
of
have
commit
no
offence
,
I
be
ready
to
submit
to
any
penance
,
let
it
be
never
so
rigorous
,
that
my
fair
enslaver
herself
shall
impose
,
provide
it
will
intitle
me
to
her
favour
and
forgiveness
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
emily
well
nigh
overcome
by
this
declaration
,
tell
him
that
as
she
tax
him
with
no
guilt
,
she
expect
no
attonement
;
and
press
her
companion
to
return
into
town
.
<EOS>
but
Sophy
,
who
be
too
indulgent
to
her
friend
's
real
inclination
to
comply
with
her
request
,
observe
that
the
gentleman
seem
so
reasonable
in
his
concession
,
she
begin
to
think
her
cousin
be
in
the
wrong
,
and
feel
herself
dispose
to
act
as
umpire
in
the
dispute
.
    
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
this
condescension
,
Mr
Pickle
thank
her
in
the
most
rapturous
term
,
and
in
the
transport
of
his
expectation
,
kiss
the
hand
of
his
kind
mediatrix
;
a
circumstance
which
have
a
remarkable
effect
on
the
countenance
of
Emilia
,
who
do
not
seem
to
relish
the
warmth
of
his
acknowledgement
.
    
<EOS>
after
many
supplication
on
one
hand
,
and
press
remonstrance
on
the
other
,
she
yield
at
length
,
and
turn
to
her
lover
,
while
her
face
be
overspread
with
blush
,
"
well
,
Sir
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
supposing
I
be
to
put
the
difference
on
that
issue
,
how
could
you
excuse
the
ridiculous
letter
which
you
send
to
me
from
Winchester
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
expostulation
introduce
a
discussion
of
the
whole
affair
,
in
which
all
the
circumstance
be
canvass
;
and
Emilia
still
affirm
with
great
heat
,
that
the
letter
must
have
be
calculate
to
affront
her
;
for
she
could
not
suppose
the
author
be
so
weak
as
to
design
it
for
any
other
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
still
retain
in
his
memory
the
substance
of
this
unlucky
epistle
,
as
well
as
the
verse
which
be
inclose
,
could
recollect
no
particular
expression
which
could
have
justly
give
the
least
umbrage
;
and
therefore
in
the
agony
of
perplexity
,
beg
that
the
whole
may
be
submit
to
the
judgment
of
Miss
Sophy
;
and
faithfully
promise
to
stand
to
her
award
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
proposal
be
with
seem
reluctance
embrace
by
Emilia
,
and
an
appointment
make
to
meet
next
day
in
the
same
place
,
whither
both
party
be
desire
to
come
provide
with
their
credential
,
accord
to
which
definitive
sentence
would
be
pronounce
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
have
succeed
thus
far
,
overwhelm
Sophy
with
acknowledgment
on
account
of
her
generous
mediation
,
and
in
the
course
of
their
walk
,
which
Emilia
be
now
in
no
hurry
to
conclude
,
whisper
a
great
many
tender
protestation
in
the
ear
of
his
mistress
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
continue
to
act
upon
the
reserve
,
until
her
doubt
should
be
more
fully
resolve
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
have
find
mean
to
amuse
them
in
the
field
till
the
twilight
,
be
oblige
to
wish
them
good
even
,
after
have
obtain
a
solemn
repetition
of
their
promise
to
meet
him
at
the
appoint
time
and
place
;
and
then
retreat
to
his
apartment
,
where
he
spend
the
whole
night
in
various
conjecture
on
the
subject
of
this
letter
,
the
gordian
knot
of
which
he
could
by
no
means
untie
.
    
<EOS>
one
<EOS>
while
he
imagine
that
some
wag
have
play
a
trick
upon
his
messenger
,
in
consequence
of
which
Emilia
have
receive
a
supposititious
letter
;
but
upon
further
reflection
,
he
could
not
conceive
the
practicability
of
any
such
deceit
.
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
mistress
,
who
,
perhaps
,
have
only
make
that
an
handle
for
discard
him
,
at
the
request
of
some
favour
rival
;
but
his
own
integrity
forbad
him
to
harbour
this
mean
suspicion
;
and
therefore
he
be
again
involve
in
the
labyrinth
of
perplexity
.
<EOS>
next
day
he
wait
on
the
rack
of
impatience
for
the
hour
of
five
in
the
afternoon
,
which
no
sooner
strike
,
than
he
order
Pipes
to
attend
him
,
in
case
there
should
be
occasion
for
his
evidence
;
and
repair
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
he
have
not
tarry
five
minute
before
the
lady
appear
.
<EOS>
mutual
compliment
be
pass
,
and
the
attendant
station
at
a
convenient
distance
,
Peregrine
persuade
them
to
sit
down
upon
the
grass
,
under
the
shade
of
a
spread
oak
,
that
they
may
be
more
at
their
ease
;
while
he
stretch
himself
at
their
foot
,
and
desire
that
the
paper
on
which
his
doom
depend
may
be
examine
.
<EOS>
It
be
accordingly
put
into
the
hand
of
his
fair
arbitress
,
who
read
it
immediately
with
an
audible
voice
.
<EOS>
the
first
two
word
of
it
be
no
sooner
pronounce
,
than
he
start
with
great
emotion
,
and
raise
himself
upon
his
hand
and
knee
,
in
which
posture
he
listen
to
the
rest
of
the
sentence
;
and
then
spring
upon
his
foot
in
the
utmost
astonishment
,
and
glow
with
resentment
at
the
same
time
,
exclaim
"
Hell
and
the
devil
!
<EOS>
what
be
all
that
?
<EOS>
sure
you
make
a
jest
of
me
,
madam
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Sir
,
(
say
Sophy
)
give
me
the
hearing
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
urge
what
you
shall
think
proper
in
your
own
defence
.
"
    
<EOS>
have
thus
caution
him
,
she
proceed
;
but
before
she
have
finish
one
half
of
the
performance
,
her
gravity
forsook
her
,
and
she
be
seize
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
,
in
which
neither
of
the
lover
could
help
join
,
notwithstanding
the
resentment
which
at
that
instant
prevail
in
the
breast
of
both
.
<EOS>
the
judge
,
however
,
in
a
little
time
,
resume
her
solemnity
,
and
have
read
the
remain
part
of
this
curious
epistle
,
all
three
continue
stare
at
each
other
alternately
for
the
space
of
half
a
minute
,
and
then
break
forth
at
the
same
instant
in
another
paroxism
of
mirth
.
<EOS>
from
this
unanimous
convulsion
,
one
would
have
think
that
both
party
be
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
joke
;
yet
this
be
by
no
means
the
case
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
imagine
that
notwithstanding
his
affected
surprize
,
her
lover
in
spite
of
himself
have
renew
the
laugh
at
her
expence
,
and
in
so
do
,
applaud
his
own
unmannerly
ridicule
.
<EOS>
this
supposition
could
not
not
fail
of
raise
and
revive
her
indignation
,
while
Peregrine
highly
resent
the
indignity
with
which
he
suppose
himself
treat
,
in
their
attempt
to
make
him
the
dupe
of
such
a
gross
and
ludicrous
artifice
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
situation
of
their
thought
,
their
mirth
be
succeed
by
a
mutual
gloominess
of
aspect
,
and
the
judge
address
herself
to
Mr
Pickle
,
<EOS>
ask
if
he
have
any
thing
to
offer
why
sentence
should
not
be
pronounce
.
"
<EOS>
Madam
,
answer
the
culprit
,
I
be
sorry
to
find
myself
so
low
in
the
opinion
of
your
cousin
,
as
to
be
think
capable
of
be
deceive
by
such
a
shallow
contrivance
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
say
Emily
,
the
contrivance
be
your
own
,
and
I
can
not
help
admire
your
confidence
in
impute
it
to
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
upon
my
honour
,
Miss
Emily
,
resume
our
hero
,
you
wrong
my
understanding
as
well
as
my
love
,
in
accuse
me
of
have
write
such
a
silly
impertinent
performance
:
the
very
appearance
and
address
of
it
be
so
unlike
the
letter
which
I
do
myself
the
honour
to
write
,
that
I
dare
say
my
man
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
will
remember
the
difference
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
extend
his
voice
,
and
beckon
to
Pipes
,
who
immediately
draw
near
.
<EOS>
His
mistress
seem
to
object
to
the
evidence
,
by
observe
that
to
be
sure
Mr
Pipes
have
his
cue
;
when
Peregrine
beg
she
would
spare
him
the
mortification
of
consider
him
in
such
a
dishonourable
light
,
desire
his
valet
to
examine
the
outside
of
the
letter
,
and
recollect
if
it
be
the
same
which
he
have
deliver
to
Miss
Gauntlet
about
two
year
ago
.
<EOS>
pipe
have
take
a
superficial
view
of
it
,
pull
up
his
breech
,
say
,
"
mayhap
it
be
,
but
we
have
make
so
many
trip
,
and
be
in
so
many
creek
and
corner
since
that
time
,
that
I
can
not
pretend
to
be
certain
;
for
I
neither
keep
journal
nor
logbook
of
our
proceeding
.
<EOS>
"
Emilia
commend
him
for
his
candour
,
at
the
same
dart
a
sarcastic
look
at
his
master
,
as
if
she
think
he
have
tamper
with
his
servant
's
integrity
in
vain
;
and
Peregrine
begin
to
rave
and
curse
his
fate
for
have
subject
him
to
such
mean
suspicion
,
attest
heaven
and
earth
in
the
most
earnest
manner
,
that
far
from
have
compose
and
convey
that
stupid
production
,
he
have
never
see
it
before
,
nor
be
privy
to
the
least
circumstance
of
the
plan
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
now
for
the
first
time
,
perceive
the
mischief
which
he
have
occasion
,
and
move
with
the
transport
of
his
master
,
for
whom
he
have
a
most
inviolable
attachment
,
frankly
declare
he
be
ready
to
make
oath
that
Mr
Pickle
have
no
hand
in
the
letter
which
he
deliver
.
<EOS>
all
three
be
amazed
at
this
confession
,
the
meaning
of
which
they
could
not
comprehend
;
and
Peregrine
after
some
pause
,
leap
upon
pipe
,
and
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
exclaim
in
an
extasy
of
rage
,
"
rascal
!
<EOS>
tell
me
this
instant
<EOS>
what
become
of
the
letter
I
intrust
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
patient
valet
,
half
strangle
<EOS>
as
he
be
,
squirt
a
collection
of
tobacco
juice
out
of
one
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
with
great
deliberation
reply
,
"
why
burn
it
,
you
would
not
have
me
give
the
young
woman
a
thing
that
shake
all
in
the
wind
in
tatter
,
would
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
lady
interpose
in
behalf
of
the
distressed
squire
,
from
whom
,
by
dint
of
question
which
he
have
neither
art
nor
inclination
to
evade
,
they
extort
an
explanation
of
the
whole
affair
.
    
<EOS>
such
ridiculous
simplicity
and
innocence
of
intention
appear
in
the
composition
of
his
expedient
,
that
even
the
remembrance
of
all
the
chagrin
which
it
have
produce
,
could
not
rouse
their
indignation
,
or
enable
them
to
resist
a
third
eruption
of
laughter
which
they
forthwith
underwent
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
be
dismiss
with
many
menacing
injunction
,
to
beware
of
such
conduct
for
the
future
;
Emilia
stand
with
a
confusion
of
joy
and
tenderness
in
her
countenance
;
Peregrine
's
eye
kindle
into
rapture
,
and
when
Miss
Sophy
pronounce
the
sentence
of
reconciliation
,
advance
to
his
mistress
,
say
,
"
truth
be
mighty
,
and
will
prevail
;
"
then
clasp
her
in
his
arm
,
very
impudently
ravish
a
kiss
,
which
she
have
not
power
to
refuse
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
,
such
be
the
impulse
of
his
joy
,
that
he
take
the
same
freedom
with
the
lip
of
Sophy
,
call
her
his
kind
mediatrix
and
guardian
angel
,
and
behave
with
such
extravagance
of
transport
,
as
plainly
evince
the
fervour
and
sincerity
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
repeat
the
tender
protestation
that
be
utter
on
one
side
,
or
describe
the
bewitching
glance
of
approbation
with
which
they
be
receive
on
the
other
;
suffice
it
to
say
,
that
the
endearing
intimacy
of
their
former
connexion
be
instantly
renew
,
and
Sophy
,
who
congratulate
them
upon
the
happy
termination
of
their
quarrel
,
favour
with
their
mutual
confidence
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
happy
pacification
,
they
deliberate
upon
the
mean
of
see
each
other
often
;
and
as
he
could
not
without
some
previous
introduction
visit
her
openly
at
the
house
of
her
relation
,
they
agree
to
meet
every
afternoon
in
the
park
till
the
next
assembly
,
at
which
he
would
solicit
her
as
a
partner
,
and
she
be
unengage
,
in
expectation
of
his
request
.
<EOS>
by
this
connexion
he
would
be
intitle
to
visit
her
next
day
,
and
thus
an
avow
correspondence
would
of
course
commence
.
<EOS>
this
plan
be
actually
put
in
execution
,
and
attend
with
a
circumstance
which
have
well
nigh
produce
some
mischievous
consequence
,
have
not
Peregrine
's
good
fortune
be
superior
to
his
discretion

Chapter

<EOS>
He

of
dance
with
her
upon
that
occasion

<EOS>
She
have
excuse
herself
to
each
,
on
pretence
of
a
slight
indisposition
that
she
foresaw
would
detain
her
from
the
ball
,
and
desire
they
would
provide
themselves
with
other
partner
.
<EOS>
oblige
to
admit
her
excuse
,
they
accordingly
follow
her
advice
;
and
after
they
have
engage
themselves
beyond
the
power
of
retracting
,
have
the
mortification
to
see
her
there
unclaimed
.
    
<EOS>
They
in
their
turn
make
up
to
her
,
and
express
their
surprize
and
concern
at
find
her
in
the
assembly
unprovide
,
after
she
have
decline
their
invitation
;
but
she
tell
them
that
her
cold
have
forsake
her
since
she
have
the
pleasure
of
see
them
,
and
that
she
would
rely
upon
accident
for
a
partner
.
<EOS>
just
as
she
pronounce
these
word
to
the
last
of
the
three

Peregrine
advance
as
an
utter
stranger
,
bow
with
great
respect

and
would

himself
highly
honour
in
be
accept
as
her
partner
for
the
night
;
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
succeed
in
his
application
.
    
<EOS>
as
they
be
by
far
the
handsome
and
best
accomplish
couple
in
the
room
,
they
could
not
fail
of
attract
the
notice
and
admiration
of
the
spectator
,
which
inflame
the
jealousy
of
his
three
competitor

who
immediately
enter
into
a
conspiracy
against
this
gaudy
stranger
,
whom
as
their
rival
,
they
resolve
to
affront
in

<EOS>
this
choleric
gentleman
,
who
be
a
country
squire
,
no
sooner
see
his
rival
,
than
he
begin
to
brandish
his
cudgel
in
a
menacing
posture
,
when
our
adventurous
youth
step
back
with
one
foot
,
lay
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
,
which
he
draw
half
way
out

<EOS>
this
attitude

the
sight
of

blade
which
glittene
by
moonlight
in

check
in
some
sort
,
the
ardour
of

assailant

who

lay
aside
his
toaster

take
a
bout
with

at

player

weapon
with
pipe

himself
in

posture
of
defence
,
and
receive
the
attack
of
his
adversary
,
who
strike
at
random
without
either
skill

oeconomy

<EOS>
Pickle
could
have
beat
the
cudgel
out

hand
at

first
blow

as
in

he
would

he

discipline
his

satisfied

vengeance

<EOS>
with
this

he
return
the
salute

raise
such
a
clatter
about
the
squire

pate
,
that
one
who
have
hear
without

the
application

would
have
mistake
the
sound

<EOS>
Peregrine
tired

with
this
exercise

<EOS>
satisfied
with

acknowledgment

the
victor
walk
up
stair
with
such
elevation
of
spirit

insolence
of

that
no

to
intimate
the
resolution

<EOS>
Emilia

remarkably
well
pleased

when
she

of
his
adventure
,
which
begin
to
make
some
noise
in
town
,
even
though
it
deprive
her
of
a
wealthy
admirer
;
for
the
squire
have
consult
an
attorney
about
the
nature
of
the
dispute
,
in
hope
of
be
able
to
prosecute
Peregrine
for
an
assault
,
and
find
little
encouragement
to
go
to
law
,
resolve
to
pocket
the
insult
and
injury
he
have
undergo
,
and
to
discontinue
his
address
to
her
who
be
the
cause
of
both
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
be
tell
by
his
mistress
that
she
propose
to
stay
a
fortnight
longer
at
Windsor
,
determine
to
enjoy
her
company
all
that
time
,
and
then
to
give
her
a
convoy
to
the
house
of
her
mother
,
whom
he
long
to
see
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
plan
,
he
every
day
contrive
some
fresh
party
of
pleasure
for
the
lady
,
to
whom
he
have
by
this
time
free
access
;
and
intangle
himself
so
much
in
the
snare
of
love
,
that
he
seem
quite
enchant
by
Emilia
's
charm
,
which
be
now
indeed
almost
irresistible
.
<EOS>
while
he
thus
heedlessly
rove
in
the
flowery
path
of
pleasure
,
his
governor
at
Oxford
alarm
at
the
unusual
duration
of
his
absence
,
go
to
the
young
gentleman
who
have
accompany
him
in
his
excursion
,
and
very
earnestly
intreate
them
to
tell
him
what
they
know
concern
his
pupil
;
they
accordingly
give
him
an
account
of
the
rencounter
that
happen
between
Peregrine
and
Miss
Emily
Gauntlet
in
the
castle
,
and
mention
circumstance
sufficient
to
convince
him
that
his
charge
be
very
dangerously
engage
.
    
<EOS>
far
from
have
an
authority
over
Peregrine
,
Mr
Jolter
durst
not
even
disoblige
him
,
and
therefore
,
instead
of
write
to
the
commodore
,
he
take
horse
immediately
,
and
that
same
night
reach
Windsor
,
where
he
find
his
stray
sheep
very
much
surprised
at
his
unexpected
arrival
.
    
<EOS>
the
governor
desire
to
have
some
serious
conversation
with
him
,
they
shut
themselves
up
in
an
apartment
,
when
Jolter
with
great
solemnity
,
communicate
the
cause
of
his
journey
,
which
be
no
other
than
his
concern
for
his
pupil
's
welfare
;
and
very
gravely
undertook
to
prove
by
mathematical
demonstration
,
that
this
intrigue
,
if
further
pursue
,
would
tend
to
the
young
gentleman
's
ruin
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
this
singular
proposition
raise
the
curiosity
of
Peregrine
,
who
promise
to
yield
all
manner
of
attention
,
and
desire
him
to
begin
without
further
preamble
.
    
<EOS>
the
governor
,
encourage
by
this
appearance
of
candour
,
express
his
satisfaction
in
find
him
so
open
to
conviction
,
and
tell
him
he
would
proceed
upon
geometrical
principle
.
<EOS>
then
hem
thrice
,
observe
,
that
no
mathematical
inquiry
could
be
carry
on
,
except
upon
certain
datum
,
or
concession
to
truth
,
that
be
self
-
evident
;
and
therefore
he
must
crave
his
assent
to
a
few
axiom
,
which
he
be
sure
Mr
Pickle
would
see
no
reason
to
dispute
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
then
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
will
grant
,
I
hope
,
that
youth
and
discretion
be
with
respect
to
each
other
as
two
parallel
line
,
which
though
infinitely
produce
,
remain
still
equi
-
distant
,
and
will
never
coincide
:
then
you
must
allow
that
passion
act
upon
the
human
mind
,
in
a
ratio
compound
of
the
acuteness
of
sense
,
and
constitutional
heat
:
and
thirdly
,
you
will
not
deny
that
the
angle
of
remorse
be
equal
to
that
of
precipitation
.
<EOS>
these
postulata
be
admit
,
(
add
he
,
take
paper
,
pen
and
ink
,
and
draw
a
parallelogram
)
<EOS>
let
youth
be
represent
by
the
right
line
a%
,
b%
,
and
discretion
by
another
right
line
c%

d%
,
parallel

the
former

<EOS>
compleat
the
parallelogram
a%

b%

the
point
of

c%

a
motion

c%

at
the
same
time
,
let
another
motion
be
communicate
to
it
,
in
the
direction
c%

d%

it
will
proceed
in

by
the
first
motion

or
the
side
c%
,
d%
,
by
the
second
.
<EOS>
to
understand
the
demonstration
of
this
corollary
,
we
must
premise
this
obvious
principle
,
that
when
a
body
be
act
upon
by
a
motion
or
power
parallel
to
a
right
line
give
in
position
,
this
power

motion
,
have
no
effect
to
cause
the
body
to
approach
towards
that
line
,
or
recede
from
it
,
but
to
move
in
a
line
parallel
to
a
right
line
only
;
as
appear
from
the
second
law
of
motion
:
therefore
c%
,
a%
,
be
parallel
to
d%

b%
,
"
     
His

thus
far

could
contain
himself
no

but
interrupt
the
investigation
with
a
loud
laugh

and
tell
him
that
his
postulata
put
him
in
mind
of
a
certain
learned
and
ingenious
gentleman
,
who
undertake
to
disprove
the
existence
of
natural
evil
,
and
ask
no
other
datum
on
which
to
find
his
demonstration
,
but
an
acknowledgment
that
every
thing
that
be
,
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
therefore
(
say
he
,
in
a
peremptory
tone
)
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
torture
your
invention
;
for
,
after
all
,
I
be
pretty
certain
that
I
shall
want
capacity
to
comprehend
the
discussion
of
your

consequently
be
oblige
to
refuse
my
assent
to
your
deduction

<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
be
disconcert
at
this
declaration

so
much
offend
at
Peregrine

disrespect

that
he
could
not

express
his
displeasure

by
tell
him
flatly

that
he
be

violent

headstrong

be
oblige
in
the
discharge

his
duty

conscience

to
inform
the
commodore
of
his

imprudence

that
if
the
law
of
this
realm
be
effectual
,
they
would
take
cognizance
of
the
gipsy
who
have
lead
him
astray
;
and
observe
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
that
if
such
a
preposterous
intrigue
have
happen
in
France
,
she
would
have
be
clapt
up
in

convent
two
year

Our

's
eye
kindle
with
indignation

when
he
hear
his

treat
with
such
irreverence

he
could
scarce
refrain
from
inflict
manual
chastisement
on
the
blasphemer
,
whom
he
reproach
in
his
wrath
as
an
arrogant
pedant

without
either
delicacy

and
caution
him
against
use
any
such
impertinent
freedom
with

on
pain
of
incur
more
severe
effect

<EOS>
Mr

who
entertain
very
high
notion

veneration

intitle

have
not

his

authority
over
his
pupil

against
whom
he
cherish
a
particular
grudge
,
ever
since
the

therefore
,
on
this
occasion
,
his
politic
forbearance
have
be
overcome
by
the
accumulate
motive

indeed

Peregrine
receive

from
his

wherein
she
commemorate
all
the
circumstance
of
the
commodore
's
benevolence
towards
him
,
when
he
be
helpless
and
forlorn

by
his

upbraid
him
for
his
misbehaviour

shock
at
the
indelicate
insinuation
of
Mrs

that

submissive
answer

his
resentment

him
up
above

SIR

your

conscious

I

ungenerous

recapitulation
of
the

as
I
take
it
for

that
you

I
must

that
far
from

sway
by

I
be
determined
to
embrace
the

to
such
dishonourable
compulsion

be
quite
different

what
he
have
expect

declare
in
a
resolute
tone
to
the
lieutenant

who
bring
it
,
that
he
may
return
as
soon

he

consult
his

remain

Hatchway
endeavour

persuade

by
all
the
argument
which
his
sagacity
and
friendship
could
supply

to
shew
a

Jack
observe
that
mayhap
Peregrine
have
get
under
Emilia
's
hatch
,
and
do
not
choose
to
set
her
adrift

if
that
be

he
himself
would
take
charge
of

cargo
safely
deliver

he
have
a
respect
for
the
young

his
needle
point
towards
matrimony
;

as
,
in

she
could
not

the

he

Peregrine
make
no
other
reply
to
this
declaration
than
by
a
contemptuous
smile

rise
from

to
retire

upon
which
the

start
up

misinterpret
by

who
refuse

satisfaction

that
which

with

him
with
a
view

<EOS>
Peregrine
see
him
arrive

guess
his
intention

assume
an
air
of
serenity

pretend
that

leave
his
handkerchief
at

go
thither

fetch
it
to
him

no
difficult
task
to
overcome
his
difficulty

such

the
obstinacy

pride

deem
himself
bind
in
honour
to
resent
the
letter
he
have

submit
to

he
would
take
no

step

until
he
should
hear
from
him

that
very
evening
set
out
for
the
garison

where
he
give
Trunnion
an
account
of
the
miscarriage
of
his
negotiation

tell
him
how
highly
Peregrine
be
offend
at

communicate

sentiment

resolution
;
and
finally
assure
him
,
that
unless
he
should

offence

he
would

in
all

never

<EOS>
the
old
commodore
be
utterly
confound
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
;
he
have
expect
all
the
humility
of
obedience
and
contrition
from
the
young
man
;
and
instead
of
that
,
receive
nothing
but
the
most
indignant
opposition
,
and
even
find
himself
in
the
predicament
of
an
offender
,
oblige
to
make
atonement
,
or
forfeit
all
correspondence
with
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
these
insolent
condition
at
first
throw
him
into
an
agony
of
wrath
,
and
he
vent
execration
with
such
rapidity
,
that
he
leave
himself
no
time
to
breathe
,
and
have
almost
be
suffocate
with
his
choler

<EOS>
He
inveigh
bitterly
against
the
ingratitude
of
Peregrine
,
whom
he
mention
with
many
opprobrious
epithet
,
and
swear
that
he
ought
to
be
keel
-
haul
for
his
presumption
;
but
when
he
begin
to
reflect
more
coolly
upon
the
spirit
of
the
young
gentleman
,
which
have
already
manifest
itself
on
many
occasion
,
and
listen
to
the
suggestion
of
Hatchway
,
whom
he
have
always
consider
as
an
oracle
in
his
way
,
his
resentment
abate
,
and
he
determine
to
take
Perry
into
favour
again
;
this
placability
be
not
a
little
facilitate
by
Jack
's
narrative
of
our
hero
's
intrepid
behaviour
at
the
assembly
,
as
well
as
in
the
contest
with
him
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
but
still
this
plaguy
amour
occur
like
a
bug
-
bear
to
his
imagination
;
for
he
hold
it
as
an
infallible
maxim
,
that
woman
be
an
eternal
source
of
misery
to
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
apothegm
he
seldom
repeat
since
his
marriage
,
except
in
the
company
of
a
very
few
intimate
,
to
whose
secrecy
and
discretion
he
could
trust

Finding
Jack
himself
at
a
nonplus
in
the
affair
of
Emilia

he
consult
Mrs

,
who
be
equally
surprised
and
offend
,
when
she
understand
that
her
letter
do
not
produce
the
desire
effect
;
and
after
have
impute
the
youth
's
obstinacy
to
his
uncle
's
unseasonable
indulgence
,
have
recourse
to
the
advice
of
the
parson

who
,
still
with
an
eye
to
his
friend
's
advantage
,
counsel
them
to
send
the
young

on
his
travel
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
would
,
in

probability
,
forget
the
amusement
of

green
year

<EOS>
the
proposal
be
judicious
,
and
immediately
approve
,
when
trunnion
go
into
his
closet

after
diver
effort

produce

as

so
long

manner

mortifying
exigency

gaudy
scheme
of
pomp

pleasure

his
luxuriant
imagination
have
form
,
begin
to
dissolve
;

train
of
melancholy
idea

never
once
mention
the
final
aim
of
his
passion
;
and
however
honourable
she
suppose
it
to
be
,
she
have
discernment
enough
to
foresee
,
that
vanity
or
interest
co
-
operating
with
the
levity
of
youth
,
may
one
day
deprive
her
of
her
lover
,
and
she
be
too
proud
to
give
him
any
handle
of
exult
at
her
expence
;
so
that
,
although
he
be
receive
by
her
with
the
most
distinguished
civility
,
and
even
an
intimacy
of
friendship
,
all
his
sollicitation
could
never
extort
from
her
an
acknowledgment
of
love
;
on
the
contrary
,
be
of
a
gay
disposition
,
she
sometimes
coquet
with
other
admirer
,
that
his
attention
thus
whet
may
never
abate
,
and
that
he
may
see
she
have
other
resource
,
in
case
he
should
flagg
in
his
affection
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
the
prudential
plan
on
which
she
act
,
it
can
not
be
suppose
that
she
would
condescend
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
his
thought
,
when
she
see
him
thus
affect
;
but
she
,
nevertheless
,
impose
that
task
on
her
cousin
and
confidante
,
who
,
as
they
walk
together
in
the
park
,
observe
that
he
seem
to
be
out
of
humour
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
the
case
,
such
a
question
generally
increase
the
disease
;
at
least
it
have
that
effect
upon
Peregrine
,
who
reply
somewhat
peevishly
,
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Madam
,
you
never
be
more
mistaken
in
your
observation
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
(
say
Emilia
)
for
I
never
see
Mr
Pickle
in
high
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
this
ironical
encomium
compleate
his
confusion
;
he
affect
to
smile
,
but
it
be
a
smile
of
anguish
,
and
in
his
heart
curse
the
vivacity
of
both
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
for
his
soul
recollect
himself
,
so
as
to
utter
one
connected
sentence
;
and
the
suspicion
that
they
observe
every
circumstance
of
his
behaviour
,
throw
such
a
damp
on
his
spirit
,
that
he
be
quite
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
resentment
,
when
Sophy
cast
her
eye
towards
the
gate
,
say
,
"
yonder
be
your
servant
,
Mr
Pickle
,
with
another
man
who
seem
to
have
a
wooden
leg

"
Peregrine
start
at
this
intelligence
,
and
immediately
undergo
sundry
change
of
complexion

know
that
his
fate
,
in
a
great
measure

depend
upon
the
information

would
receive

bow
to

take
the

aside

and
put
the
commodore
's
letter
into
his
hand

which
throw
him
into
such
an
agitation

that
he
could
scarce
pronounce
,
<EOS>
"
lady

will
you
give
me
leave

and
when

in

he
fumble
with
such

that
his

lovely
eye

recover
his
serenity

the

sparkle
with
joy

his
conversation
with
such
an
uncommon
flow
of
sprightliness

an
impression

turn
for

<EOS>
Sophy
observe
,
that
now

's
eye

refuse
the
present
,
say
,
"
no
,
thank
ye
as
much
as
if
I
do
.
"
<EOS>
and
though
she
insist
upon
his
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
as
a
small
testimony
of
her
gratitude
,
he
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
avail
himself
of
her
generosity
;
but
follow
her
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
thrust
it
into
her
sleeve
without
ceremony
,
exclaim
,
"
I
will
be
damned
to
hell
if
I
do
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
have
check
him
for
his
boorish
behaviour
,
send
him
out
of
the
room
,
and
beg
that
Miss
Sophy
would
not
endeavour
to
debauch
the
moral
of
his
servant
,
who
rough
and
uncultivated
as
he
be
,
have
sense
enough
to
perceive
that
he
have
no
pretension
to
any
such
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
but
she
argue
with
great
vehemence
,
that
she
should
never
be
able
to
make
an
acknowledgment
adequate
to
the
service
he
have
do
her
,
and
that
she
should
never
be
perfectly
easy
in
her
own
mind
,
until
she
find
some
opportunity
of
manifest
the
sense
she
have
of
the
obligation
:
"
I
do
not
pretend
(
say
she
)
to
reward
Mr
Pipes
;
but
I
shall
be
absolutely
unhappy
,
unless
I
be
allow
to
give
him
some
token
of
my
regard
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
thus
earnestly
sollicite
,
desire
that
since
she
be
bent
upon
display
her
generosity
,
she
would
not
bestow
upon
him
any
pecuniary
gratification
,
but
honour
him
with
some
trinket
,
as
a
mark
of
consideration
;
because
he
himself
have
such
a
particular
value
for
the
fellow
,
on
account
of
his
attachment
and
fidelity
,
that
he
should
be
sorry
to
see
him
treat
on
the
footing
of
a
common
mercenary
domestick
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
jewel
in
the
possession
of
this
grateful
young
lady
,
that
she
would
not
have
gladly
give
as
a
recompence
,
or
badge
of
distinction
,
to
her
rescuer
:
but
his
master
pitch
upon
a
seal
ring
of
no
great
value
that
hang
at
her
watch
;
and
Pipes
be
call
in
,
have
permission
to
accept
that
testimony
of
Miss
Sophy
's
favour
.
<EOS>
Tom
receive
it
accordingly
with
sundry
scrape
,
and
have
kiss
it
with
great
devotion
,
put
it
on
his
little
finger
,
and
strut
off
,
extremely
proud
of
his
acquisition
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
with
a
most
enchanting
sweetness
of
aspect
,
tell
her
lover
,
that
he
have
instruct
her
how
to
behave
towards
him
;
and
take
a
diamond
ring
from
her
finger
,
desire
he
would
wear
it
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
He
receive
the
pledge
as
become
him
,
and
present
another
in
exchange
,
which
she
at
first
refuse
,
alledge
that
it
would
destroy
the
intent
of
her
acknowledgment
;
but
Peregrine
assure
her
,
he
have
accept
her
jewel
,
not
as
a
proof
of
her
gratitude
,
but
as
the
mark
of
her
love
;
and
that
if
she
refuse
a
mutual
token
,
he
should
look
upon
himself
as
the
object
of
her
disdain
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
kindle
,
and
her
cheek
glow
with
resentment
at
this
impudent
intimation
,
which
she
consider
as
an
unseasonable
insult
;
and
the
young
gentleman
perceive
her
emotion
,
stand
correct
for
his
temerity
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
of
his
remonstrance
,
which
he
hope
she
would
ascribe
to
the
prevalence
of
that
principle
alone
,
which
he
have
always
take
pride
in
avow
.
    
<EOS>
Sophy
see
him
disconcert
,
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
and
chid
her
cousin
for
have
practise
such
unnecessary
affectation
;
upon
which
Emilia
,
soften
into
compliance
,
hold
out
her
finger
as
a
signal
of
her
condescension
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
put
on
the
ring
with
great
eagerness
,
mumble
her
soft
white
hand
in
an
extasy
,
which
would
not
allow
him
to
confine
his
embrace
to
that
limb
,
but
urge
him
to
seize
her
by
the
waist
,
and
snatch
a
delicious
kiss
from
her
love
-
pouting
lip
;
nor
would
he
leave
her
a
butt
to
the
ridicule
of
Sophy
,
on
whose
mouth
he
instantly
commit
a
rape
of
the
same
nature
;
so
that
the
two
friend
,
countenance
by
each
other
,
reprehend
him
with
such
gentleness
of
rebuke
,
that
he
be
almost
tempt
to
repeat
the
offence
.
    
<EOS>
the
morning
be
now
light
up
,
and
the
servant
of
the
inn
on
foot
,
he
order
some
chocolate
for
breakfast
,
and
at
the
desire
of
the
lady
send
Pipes
to
see
the
horse
feed
,
and
the
chariot
prepare
,
while
he
go
to
the
bar
,
and
discharge
the
bill
.
    
<EOS>
these
measure
be
take
,
they
set
out
about
five
o'clock
,
and
have
refresh
themselves
and
their
cattle
at
another
inn
on
the
road
,
during
the
heat
of
the
day
,
they
proceed
in
the
afternoon
;
and
,
without
meet
with
any
other
accident
,
safely
arrive
at
the
place
of
their
destination
,
where
Mrs
Gauntlet
express
her
joy
at
see
her
old
friend
Mr
Pickle
,
whom
,
however
,
she
kindly
reproach
for
the
long
discontinuance
of
his
regard
.
<EOS>
without
explain
the
cause
of
that
interruption
,
he
protest
that
his
love
and
esteem
have
never
be
discontinue
,
and
that
for
the
future
he
should
omit
no
occasion
of
testify
how
much
he
have
her
friendship
at
heart
.
<EOS>
She
then
make
him
acquaint
with
her
son
,
who
at
that
time
be
in
the
house
,
be
excuse
from
his
duty
by
furlow
.
    
<EOS>
this
young
man
,
whose
name
be
Godfrey
,
be
about
the
age
of
twenty
,
of
a
middling
size
,
vigorous
make
,
remarkably
well
shaped
,
and
the
scar
of
the
small
pox
,
of
which
he
bear
a
good
number
,
add
a
peculiar
manliness
to
the
air
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
capacity
be
good
,
and
his
disposition
naturally
frank
and
easy
;
but
he
have
be
a
soldier
from
his
infancy
,
and
his
education
be
altogether
in
the
military
stile
.
    
<EOS>
He
look
upon
taste
and
letter
as
meer
pedantry
,
beneath
the
consideration
of
a
gentleman
,
and
every
civil
station
of
life
as
mean
,
when
compare
with
the
profession
of
arm
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
great
progress
in
the
gymnastic
science
of
dancing
,
fence
and
ride
,
play
perfectly
well
on
the
german
flute
,
and
above
all
thing
value
himself
upon
a
scrupulous
observance
of
all
the
point
of
honour
.
    
<EOS>
have
Peregrine
<EOS>
and
he
consider
themselves
upon
equal
footing
,
in
all
probability
they
would
have
immediately
enter
into
a
league
of
intimacy
and
friendship
;
but
this
sufficient
soldier
look
upon
his
sister
's
admirer
as
a
young
student
raw
from
the
university
,
and
utterly
ignorant
of
mankind
,
while
squire
Pickle
beheld
Godfrey
in
the
light
of
a
needy
volunteer
,
greatly
inferior
to
himself
in
fortune
,
as
well
as
every
other
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
this
mutual
misunderstanding
could
not
fail
of
produce
animosity
.
<EOS>
the
very
next
day
after
Peregrine
's
arrival
,
some
sharp
repartee
pass
between
them
in
presence
of
the
lady
,
before
whom
each
endeavour
to
assert
his
own
superiority
.
<EOS>
in
these
contest
our
hero
never
fail
of
obtain
the
victory
,
because
his
genius
be
more
acute
,
and
his
talent
better
cultivate
than
those
of
his
antagonist
,
who
therefore
take
umbrage
at
his
success
,
become
jealous
of
his
reputation
,
and
begin
to
treat
him
with
mark
of
scorn
and
disrespect
.
    
<EOS>
His
sister
see
,
and
dread
the
consequence
of
his
ferocity
,
not
only
take
him
to
talk
in
private
for
his
impolite
behaviour
,
but
also
intreate
her
lover
to
make
allowance
for
the
roughness
of
her
brother
's
education
.
    
<EOS>
He
kindly
assure
her
,
that
whatever
pain
it
may
cost
him
to
vanquish
his
own
impetuous
temper
,
he
would
for
her
sake
endure
all
the
mortification
to
which
her
brother
's
arrogance
may
expose
him
;
and
after
have
stay
with
her
two
day
,
and
enjoy
several
private
interview
,
during
which
he
act
the
part
of
a
most
passionate
lover
,
he
take
his
leave
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
over
-
night
,
and
tell
the
young
lady
he
would
call
early
next
morning
,
to
bid
them
farewel

<EOS>
He
do
not
neglect
this
piece
of
duty
,
and
find
the
two
friend
and
breakfast
already
prepare
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
all
three
be
extremely
affected
with
the
thought
of
parting
,
a
most
pathetic
silence
for
some
time
prevail
,
till
Peregrine
put
an
end
to
it
,
by
lament
his
fate
,
in
be
oblige
to
exile
himself
so
long
from
the
dear
object
of
his
most
interesting
wish

and
beg
with
the
most
earnest
supplication
,
that
she
would
now
,
in
consideration
of
the
cruel
absence
he
must
suffer
,
give
him
the
consolation
which
she
have
hitherto
refuse
,
namely
,
that
of

he
possess
a
place
within

<EOS>
the

it
be
now

when

unless

in
short

such
irresistible
importunity

that

utmost
confusion

<EOS>

you
deal

happiness
in
such

<EOS>
why

mingle
his
tear
with
her
in

breathe
the
most
tender

<EOS>
the
gentle

could
not

she
weep
with
sympathy

encourage
the

<EOS>
finally

after
mutual

Peregrine
take

<EOS>
in

expel
the
melancholy

at
part
from
his

he
call
in
the
flattering

Peregrine
return
his
compliment
with
such
disdainful
civility
,
as
give
him
room
to
believe
that
he
suspect
his
errand
;
and
therefore
,
without
further
preamble
,
he
declare
his
business
in
these
word
:
"
Mr
Pickle
,
you
have
carry
on
a
correspondence
with
my
sister
for
some
time
,
and
I
should
be
glad
to
know
the
nature

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
this
question
our
lover
reply
,
"
Sir

I
should
be
glad
to
know
what
title
you
have
to
demand
that
satisfaction
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
answer
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
demand
it
in
the
capacity
of
a
brother
,
jealous
of
his
own
honour
,
as
well
as
of
his
sister
's
reputation
;
and
if
your
intention
be
honourable
,
you
will
not
refuse
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
say
Peregrine
)
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
present
dispose
to
appeal
to
your
opinion
for
the
rectitude
of
my
intention
;
and
I
think
you
assume
a
little
too
much
importance
,
in
pretend
to
judge
my
conduct
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
reply
the
soldier
)
<EOS>
I
pretend
to
judge
the
conduct
of
every
man
who
interfere
with
my
concern
,
and
even
to
chastise
him
,
if
I
think
he
act
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
Chastise
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
youth
,
with
indignation
in
his
look
)
<EOS>
sure
you
dare
not
apply
that
term
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
You
be
mistaken
(
say
Godfrey
)
<EOS>
I
dare
do
any
thing
that
become
the
character

Gentleman

pretty

<EOS>
the
soldier
's
wrath
be
inflame
by
this
ironical
repetition
,
the
contempt
of
which
his
conscious
poverty
make
him
feel

and
he
call
his
antagonist
presumptuous
boy
,
insolent
upstart
,
with
other
epithet
,
which
Perry
retort
with
great
bitterness
:
and
a
formal
challenge
have
pass
between
them
,
they
alight
at
the
first
inn

and
walk
into
the
next

their
quarrel

<EOS>

pitch
upon
the

Mr
Gauntlet
tell
his
opponent

that

should
be
upon

more
equal

<EOS>
Peregrine
be
too
much
incensed
to
thank
him
for
his
plain
dealing
,
and
too
confident
of
his
own
skill
to
relish
the
other

draw
his

<EOS>
exasperate
at
this
expression
,
which
he
consider
as
an
indelible
affront
,
he
make
no

but
attack
his
adversary
with
equal
ferocity
and
address
.
<EOS>
the
youth
parry
his
first
and
second
thrust
,
but
receive
the
third
in
the
outside
of

<EOS>
though
the
wound
be
superficial
,
he
be
transport
with
rage
at
sight
of
his
own
blood
,
and
return
the
assault
with
such
fury
and
precipitation
,
that
Gauntlet
,
loath
to
take
advantage
of
his
unguarded
heat
,
stand
upon
the
defensive
;
and
in
the
second
longe
,
Peregrine
's
weapon
enter
a
kind
of
net
work
in
the
shell
of
Godfrey
's
sword
,
the
blade
snap
in
two
,
and
leave
him
at
the
mercy
of
the
soldier
,
who
,
far
from
make
an
insolent
use
of
the
victory
he
have
gain
,
put
up
his
Toledo
with
great
deliberation
,
like
a
man
who
have
be
use
to
that
kind
of
rencounter
,
observe
that
such
a
blade
as
Peregrine
's
be
not
to
be
trust
with
a
man
's
life
,
and
advise
the
owner
to
treat
a
gentleman
in
distress
with
more
respect
for
the
future
,
slip
on
his
boot
,
and
with
sullen
dignity
of
demeanour
stalk
back
to
the
inn
.
    
<EOS>
though
Pickle
be
extremely
mortify
at
his
miscarriage
in
this
adventure
,
he
be
also
strike
with
the
behaviour
of
his
antagonist
,
which
affect
him
the
more
,
as
he
understand
that
Godfrey
's
fiert
have
proceed
from
the
jealous
sensibility
of
a
gentleman
decline
into
the
vale
of
misfortune
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
's
valour
and
moderation
induce
him
to
put
a
favourable
construction
on
all
those
circumstance
of
that
young
soldier
's
conduct
,
which
before
have
give
him
disgust
;
and
though
in
any
other
case
he
would
have
industriously
avoid
the
least
appearance
of
submission
,
he
follow
his
conqueror
to
the
inn
,
with
a
view
of
thank
him
for
his
generous
forbearance
,
and
of
sollicite
his
friendship
and
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
have
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
to
mount
,
when
Peregrine
come
up
to
him
,
desire
he
would
defer
his
departure
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
favour
him
with
a
little
private
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
,
who
mistake
the
meaning
of
the
request
,
immediately
quit
his
horse
,
and
follow
Pickle
into
a
chamber
,
where
he
expect
to
find
a
brace
of
pistol
load
on
the
table
;
but
he
be
very
agreeably
deceive
,
when
our
hero
,
in
the
most
respectful
term
,
acknowledge
his
noble
deportment
in
the
field
,
own
that
till
then
he
have
misunderstood
his
character
,
and
beg
that
he
would
honour
him
with
his
intimacy
and
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
have
see
undoubted
proof
of
Peregrine
's
courage
,
which
have
considerably
raise
him
in
his
esteem
,
and
have
sense
enough
to
perceive
that
this
concession
be
not
owe
to
any
sordid
or
sinister
motive
,
embrace
his
offer
with
demonstration
of
infinite
satisfaction
;
and
when
he
understand
the
term
on
which
Mr
Pickle
be
with
his
sister
,
proffer
his
service
in
his
turn
,
either
as
agent
,
mediator
,
or
confidant
:
<EOS>
nay
,
to
give
this
new
friend
a
convincing
proof
of
his
sincerity
,
he
disclose
to
him
a
passion
which
he
have
for
some
time
entertain
for
his
cousin
Miss
Sophy
,
though
he
durst
not
reveal
his
sentiment
to
her
father
,
lest
he
should
be
offend
at
his
presumption
,
and
withdraw
his
protection
from
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
generous
heart
be
wrung
with
anguish
,
when
he
understand
that
this
young
gentleman
,
who
be
the
only
son
of
a
distinguished
officer
,
have
carry
arm
for
the
space
of
five
year
,
without
be
able
to
obtain
a
subaltern

commission
,
though
he
have
always
behave
with
remarkable
regularity
and
spirit
,
and
acquire
the
friendship
and
esteem
of
all
the
officer
under
whom
he
have
serve
.
    
<EOS>
He
would
,
at
that
time
,
with
the
utmost
pleasure
,
have
share
his
finance
with
him
;
but
as
he
would
not
run
the
risk
of
offend
the
young
soldier
's
delicacy
of
honour
,
by
a
premature
exertion
of
his
liberality
,
he
resolve
to
insinuate
himself
into
an
intimacy
with
him
,
before
he
would
venture
to
take
such
freedom
;
and
with
that
view
press
Mr
Gauntlet
to
accompany
him
to
the
garison
,
where
he
do
not
doubt
of
have
influence
enough
to
make
him
a
welcome
guest
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
thank
him
very
courteously
for
his
invitation
,
which
he
say
he
could
not
immediately
accept
,
but
promise
if
he
would
favour
him
with
a
letter
,
and
fix
the
time
at
which
he
propose
to
set
out
for
France
,
he
would
endeavour
to
visit
him
at
the
commodore
's
habitation
,
and
from
thence
give
him
a
convoy
to
Dover
.

of
his

Emilia

to
whom
and
his
friend
Sophy
<EOS>

and
have
lodge
one
night
upon
the
road
,
arrive
next
day
in
the
afternoon
at
the
garison
,
where
he
find
all
his
friend
in
good
health
,
and
overjoy
at

<EOS>
the
commodore
,
who
be
by
this
time
turn
of
seventy
,
and
altogether
cripple
by
the
gout
,
seldom
go
abroad
;
and
as
his
conversation
be
not
very
entertaining
,
have
but
little
company
within
door
;
so
that
his
spirit
must
have
quite
stagnate
,
have
not
they
be
keep
in
motion
by
the
conversation
of
Hatchway
,
and
receive
at
different
time
an
wholesome
fillip
from
the
discipline
of
his
spouse
,
who
,
by
the
force
of
pride
,
religion
and
Coniac
,
have
erect
a
most
terrible
tyranny
in
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
quick
circulation
of
domestick
in
the
family
,
that
every
suit
of
livery
have
be
wear
by
figure
of
all
dimension
:
<EOS>
trunnion
himself
have
long
before
this
time
yield
to
the
torrent
of
her
arbitrary
sway
;
though
not
without
diver
obstinate
effort
to
maintain
his
liberty
;
and
now
,
that
he
be
disable
by
his
iufirmitie
,
when
he
use
to
hear
his
empress
singe
the
loud
orthyan
song
among
the
servant
below
,
he
would
often
in
whisper
communicate
to
the
lieutenant

<EOS>
hint
of
what
he
would
do
if
so
be
he
be
not
deprive
of
the
use
of
his
precious
limb

<EOS>
Hatchway
be
the
only
person
whom
the
temper
of
Mrs
Trunnion
respect
,
either
because
she
dread
his
ridicule
,
or
look
upon
his
person
with
the
eye
of
affection
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
situation
of
thing
in
the
garison
,
it
be
not
to
be
doubt
that
the
old
gentleman
highly
enjoy
the
presence
of
Peregrine
,
who
find
mean
to
ingratiate
himself
so
effectually
with
his
aunt
,
that
while
he
remain
at
home
,
she
seem
to
have
exchange
the
disposition
of
a
tygress
,
for
that
of
a
gentle
kid
;
but
he
find
his
own
mother
as
implacable
,
and
his
father
as
much
hen
-
peck
as
ever
.
    
<EOS>
Gamaliel
,
who
now
very
seldom
enjoy
the
conversation
of
his
old
friend
the
commodore
,
have
some
time
ago
enter
into
an
amicable
society
,
consist
of
the
barber
,
apothecary
,
attorney
and
exciseman
of
the
parish
,
among
whom
he
use
to
spend
the
evening
at
Tunley
's
,
and
listen
to
their
dispute
upon
philosophy
and
politick
,
with
great
comfort
and
edification
,
while
his
sovereign
lady
domineer
at
home
as
usual
,
visit
with
great
pomp
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
employ
her
chief
care
in
the
education
of
her
darle
son
Gam
,
who
be
now
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
his
age
,
and
so
remarkable
for
his
perverse
disposition
,
that
in
spite
of
his
mother
's
influence
and
authority
,
he
be
not
only
hate
,
but
also
despise
both
at
home
and
abroad
.
<EOS>
She
have
put
him
under
the
tuition
of
the
curate
who
live
in
the
family
,
and
be
oblige
to
attend
him
in
all
his
exercise
and
excursion
.
<EOS>
this
governor
be
a
low
breed
fellow
,
who
have
neither
experience
nor
ingenuity
,
but
possess
a
large
fund
of
adulation
and
servile
complaisance
,
by
which
he
have
gain
the
good
grace
of
Mrs
Pickle
,
and
preside
over
all
her
deliberation
in
the
same
manner
as
his
superior
manage
those
of
Mrs
Trunnion
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
one
day
ride
out
to
take
the
air
with
his
pupil
,
who
,
as
I
have
already
observe
,
be
odious
to
the
poor
people
,
for
have
kill
their
dog
and
break
their
inclosure
,
and
on
account
of
his
hump
,
distinguish
by
the
title
of
my
lord
;
when
in
a
narrow
lane
they
chance
to
meet
Peregrine
on
horseback
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
squire
no
sooner
perceive
his
eld
brother
,
for
whom
he
have
be
instruct
to
entertain
the
most
inveterate
grudge
,
than
he
resolve
to
insult
him
en
passant
,
and
actually
ride
against
him
full
gallop
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
guess
his
aim
,
fix
himself
in
his
stirrup
,
and
by
a
dexterous
management
of
the
rein
,
avoid
the
shock
in
such
a
manner
,
as
that
their
leg
only
should
encounter
,
by
which
mean
my
lord
be
tilt
out
of
his
saddle
,
and
in
a
twinkling
lay
sprawl
in
the
dirt
.
<EOS>
the
governor
enrage
at
the
disgrace
of
his
charge
,
advanced
with
great
insolence
and
fury
,
and
strike
at
Peregrine
with
his
whip
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
our
young
gentleman
than
this
assault
,
which
furnish
him
with
an
opportunity
of
chastise
an
officious
wretch
,
whose
petulance
and
malice
he
have
long
to
punish
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
spur
up
his
horse
towards
his
antagonist
,
overthrow
him
in
the
middle
of
a
hedge
;
and
before
he
have
time
to
recollect
himself
from
the
confusion
of
the
fall
,
alight
in
a
trice
,
and
exercise
his
horse
-
whip
with
such
agility
about
the
curate
's
face
and
ear
,
that
he
be
fain
to
prostrate
himself
before
his
enraged
conqueror
,
and
implore
his
forbearance
in
the
most
abject
term
.
<EOS>
while
Peregrine
be
thus
employ
,
his
brother
Gam
have
make
shift
to
rise
,
and
attack
him
in
the
rear

for
which
reason
,
when
the

the
victor
face
about
,
snatch
the
weapon
out
of
his
hand
,
and
have
break
it
to
piece
,
remount
his
horse
,
and
ride
off
,
without
deign
to
honour
him
with
any
other
notice
.
    
<EOS>
the
condition
in
which
they
return
produce
infinite
clamour
against
the
conqueror
,
who
be
represent
as
a
ruffian
who
have
lain
in

to

<EOS>
complaint
be
make
to
the
commodore
,
who
have
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of

Chapter
XXXII
He

a
plan
of
revenge
,
which

<EOS>
Our
hero
,
exasperate
at
the
villainy
of
the
curate
,
in
the
treacherous
misrepresentation
he
have
make
of
this
rencounter
,
determine
to
practise
upon
him
a
method
of
revenge
,
which
should
be
not
only
effectual
,
but
also
unattende
with
any
bad
consequence
to
himself
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
he
and
Hatchway
,
to
whom
he
impart
his
plan
,
go
to
the
alehouse
one
evening
,
and
call
for
an
empty
room
,
know
there
be
no
other
but
that
which
they
have
choose
for
the
scene
of
action
.
    
<EOS>
this
apartment
be
a
sort
of
a
parlour
that
front
the
kitchen
,
with
a
window
towards
the
yard
;
where
,
after
they
have
sit
some
time
,
the
lieutenant
find
mean
to
amuse
the
landlord
in
discourse
,
while
Peregrine
step
out
into
the
yard
,
by
the
talent
of
mimickry
,
which
he
possess
in
a
surprising
degree
,
counterfeit
a
dialogue
beteen
the
curate
and
Tunley
's
wife
;
which
reach
the
ear
of
the
publican
,
for
whose
hearing
it
be
calculate
,
inflame
his
naturally
jealous
disposition
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
not
conceal
his
emotion
,
but
make
an
hundred
effort
to
quit
the
room
;
while
the
lieutenant
,
smoake
his
pipe
with
great
gravity
,
as
if
he
neither
hear
what
pass
,
nor
take
notice
of
the
landlord
's
disorder
,
detain
him
on
the
spot
by
a
succession
of
question
which
he
could
not
refuse
to
answer
;
though
he
stand
sweat
with
agony
all
the
time
,
stretch
his
neck
every
instant
towards
the
window
thro
'
which
the
voice
be
convey
,
scratch
his
head
,
and
exhibit
sundry
other
symptom
of
impatience
and
agitation
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
suppose
conversation
come
to
such
a
pitch
of
amorous
complaisance
,
that
the
husband
,
quite
frantic
with
his
imaginary
disgrace
,
rush
out
at
the
door
,
cry
,
"
Coming
,
Sir

"
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
be
oblige
to
make
a
circuit
round
one
half
of
the
house
,
Peregrine
have
get
in
by
the
window
,
before
Tunley
arrive
in
the
yard
.
    
<EOS>
accord
to
the
feigned
intelligence
he
have
receive
,
he
run
directly
to
the
barn
,
in
expectation
of
make
some
very
extraordinary
discovery
;
and
have
employ
some
minute
in
rummage
the
straw
to
no
purpose
,
return
in
a
state
of
distraction
to
the
kitchen
,
just
as
his
wife
chance
to
enter
at
the
other
door
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
her
appearance
confirm
him
in
the
opinion
,
that
the
deed
be
do
;
but
as
the
disease
of
be
hen
-
peck'd
be
epidemic
in
the
parish
,
he
durst
not
express
the
least
hint
of
his
uneasiness
to
her
,
but
resolve
to
take
vengeance
on
the
libidinous
priest
,
who
,
he
imagine
,
have
corrupt
the
chastity
of
his
spouse

<EOS>
the
two

in
order
to
be
certify
that
their
scheme
have
take
effect
,
as
well
as
to
blow
up
the
flame
which
they
have
kindle
,
call
for
Tunley
,
in
whose
countenance
they
could
easily
discern
his
confusion
;
and
Peregrine
desire
him
to
sit
down
and
drink
a
glass
with
them
,
begin
to
interrogate
him
about
his
family
,
and
among
other
thing
,
ask
him
how
long
he
have
be
marry
to
that
handsome
wife
?
    
<EOS>
this
question
,
which
be

the

this
suspicion
be
not

all

when
the

,
with
a
sly
regard
,
pronounce
,
"
Tunley

reply
the

with
an
eagerness

perplexity
of

as
if
he

the
lieutenant

that

Nay

this
transition
from

convince
him
that
his

be

to

in

he
pronounce
with
great

,
"
a

odd

<EOS>
the

be
satisfied
by
these
abrupt
insinuation
,
that
they
have
so
far
succeed
in
their
aim
,
wait
with
impatience
two
or
three
day
,
in
expectation
of
hear
that
Tunley
have
fall
upon
some
method
of
be
revenge
for
this
imaginary
wrong
:
but
find
that
either
his
invention
be
too
shallow
,
or
his
inclination
too
languid
to
gratify
their
desire
of
his
own
accord
<EOS>
,
they
determine
to
bring
the
affair
to
such
a
crisis
,
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
opportunity
of
execute
his
vengeance
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
they
one
evening
hire
a
boy
to
run
to
Mr
Pickle
's
house
,
and
tell
the
curate
,
that
Mrs
Tunley

take
suddenly
ill

he
would
come
immediately
,

with

Mean

they
have
take
possession
of

the
landlord
in
conversation

Peregrine
in
his
return

observe

as

by
accident

that
the
parson
be
go
into
the
kitchen
,
in
order

as
he
suppose
,
to
catechise
Tunley
's
wife

<EOS>
the
publican
start
at
this
intelligence
,
and
under
pretence
of
serve
another
company
in
the
next
room
,
go
out
to
the
barn
,
and
arm
himself
with
a
flail
,
repair
to
a
lane
thro

which
the

be
under
a
necessity
of
pass
in
his

home

<EOS>
there
he
lie
in
ambush
,
with
fell
intent
;
and
when
the
suppose
author
of
his
shame
arrive
,
greet
him
in
the
dark
with
such
a
salutation
,
as
force
him
to
stagger
backward
three
pace
at

.
<EOS>
if
the
second
application
have
take
effect
,
in

probability
that
spot
would
have
be
the
boundary

mortal
peregrination

,
luckily
for

,
his
antagonist
be
not
expert
in
the
management

his
weapon

which
,
by
a
twist
of
the
thong
that
connect
the
leg
,
instead
of
pitch
upon
the
head
of
the
astonished
curate
,
descend
in
an
oblique
direction
on
his
own
pate

with
such
a
swing
,
that
the
skull
actually
ring
like
an
apothecary
's
mortar
,
and
ten
thousand
light
seem
to
dance
before
his
eye

<EOS>
the
curate
recollect
himself
during
the
respite
he
obtain
from
this
accident
,
and
believe
his
aggressor
to
be
some
thief
who
lurk
in
that
place
for
prey
,
resolve
to
make
a
run
fight
,
until
he
should
arrive
within
cry
of
his

<EOS>
with
this
design
he
raise
up
his
cudgel
for
the
defence
of
his
head

betake
himself
to
his
heel
,
begin
to
roar
for
help
with
the
lung
of

<EOS>
Tunley
throw
away
the

durst
no

that
whistle
round
his

than
he
fall
flat
upon
the
earth
at
full
length
,
and
the
cudgel
fly
from
his
unclasping
hand
;
when
Tunley
spring
like
a
tyger
upon

rain
such
a
shower
of
blow
upon
his
carcase

that
he
imagine

under

yet
the

not

with

the

lay
hold
on
one
of
his

bit
so
unmercifully

almost
intrance
with
pain
by
two

at

the

retreat
unperceived

<EOS>
the

have
post
himself
at
the
window
,
in
order
to
see
the
landlord
at
his
first
return

no
sooner
perceive
him
enter
the
yard
,
than
he
call
him
into
the
apartment
,
impatient
to
learn
the
effect
of
their
stratagem
.
<EOS>
Tunley
obey
the
summon
,
and
appear
before
his
guest
in
all
the
violence
of
rage
,
disorder
and
fatigue
;
his

be
dilate
more
than

his

to

guess
from
this
reply

that
his

be
accomplish

curious
to
know
the
particular
of

desire
he
would
sit
down
and
recover

and
after
he
have
swallow
a
brace
of

his
vanity
prompt
him
to
expatiate
upon
his
own
exploit
in
such

chapter
XXXIII
   
<EOS>
when
he
consider
the
circumstance
of
the
ambuscade
,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
he
have
be
assault
by
a
common
thief
,
because
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
a
robber
would
have
amuse
himself
in
pummel
rather
than
in
rifle
his
prey
;
he
therefore
ascribe
his
misfortune
to
the
secret
enmity
of
some
person
who
have
a
design
upon
his
life
;
and
upon
mature
deliberation
,
fix
his
suspicion
upon
Peregrine
,
who
be
the
only
man
on
earth
from
whom
he
think
he
deserve
such
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
communicate
this
conjecture
to
his
pupil
,
who
readily
adopt
his
opinion
,
and
advise
him
strenuously
to
revenge
the
wrong
by
a
like
contrivance
,
without
seek
to
make
a
narrow
inquiry
,
lest
his
enemy
should
be
thereby
put
upon
his
guard
.
    
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
relish
,
they
in
concert
revolve
the
mean
of
retort
the
ambush
with
interest
,
and
actually
lay
such
a
villainous
plan
for
attack
our
hero
in
the
dark
,
that
,
have
it
be
execute
accord
to
their
intention
,
the
young
gentleman
's
scheme
of
travel
would
have
be
effectually
mar
.
<EOS>
but
their
machination
be
overhear
by
Miss
Pickle
,
who
be
now
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
her
age
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
prejudice
of
education
,
entertain
in
secret
a
most
sisterly
affection
for
her
brother
Perry
,
though
she
have
never
speak
to
him
,
and
be
deter
by
the
precept
,
vigilance
and
menace
of
her
mother
,
from
attempt
any
mean
of
meet
him
in
private
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
however
,
insensible
to
his
praise
,
which
be
loudly
sound
forth
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
never
fail
of
go
to
church
,
and
every
other
place
,
where
she
think
she
may
have
an
opportunity
of
see
this
amiable
brother
.
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
it
can
not
be
suppose
that
she
would
hear
the
conspiracy
without
emotion
.
<EOS>
She
be
shock
at
the
treacherous
barbarity
of
Gam
,
and
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
the
danger
to
which
Peregrine
would
be
expose
from
their
malice
.
<EOS>
She
durst
not
communicate
this
plot
to
her
mother
,
because
she
be
afraid
that
lady
's
unaccountable
aversion
for
her
first
-
bear
would
hinder
her
from
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
and
consequently
render
her
a
sort
of
accomplice
in
the
guilt
of
his
assassin
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
resolve
to
warn
Peregrine
of
the
conspiracy
,
an
account
of
which
she
transmit
to
him
in
an
affectionate
letter
,
by
mean
of
a
young
gentleman
in
that
neighbourhood
,
who
make
his
address
to
her
at
that
time
,
and
who
,
at
her
request
,
offer
his
service
to
our
hero
,
in
defeat
the
project
of
his
adversary
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
startle
when
he
read
the
particular
of
their
scheme
,
which
be
no
other
than
an
intention
to
sally
upon
him
when
he
should
be
altogether
unprovided
against
such
an
attack
,
cut
off
his
ear
,
and
otherwise
mutilate
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
should
have
no
cause
to
be
vain
of
his
person
for
the
future
.
    
<EOS>
Incensed
as
he
be
against
the
brutal
disposition
of
his
own
father
's
son
,
he
could
not
help
be
move
at
the
integrity
and
tenderness
of
his
sister
,
of
whose
inclination
towards
him
he
have
be
hitherto
keep
in
ignorance
.
<EOS>
He
thank
the
gentleman
for
his
honourable
dealing
,
and
express
a
desire
of
be
better
acquaint
with
his
virtue
;
tell
him
,
that
now
he
be
caution
,
he
hope
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
give
him
any
further
trouble
,
and
write
by
him
a
letter
of
acknolwedgment
to
his
sister
,
for
whom
he
express
the
utmost
love
and
regard
,
beseech
her
to
favour
him
with
an
interview
before
his
departure
,
that
he
may
indulge
his
fraternal
fondness
,
and
be
bless
with
the
company
and
countenance
of
one
at
least
belong
to
his
own
family
.
    
<EOS>
have
impart
this
discovery
to
his
friend
Hatchway
,
they
come
to
a
resolution
of
countermine
the
plan
of
their
enemy
;
and
as
they
do
not
choose
to
expose
themselves
to
the
insinuation
of
slander
,
which
would
have
exert
itself
at
their
expence
,
have
they
,
even
in
defend
themselves
,
employ
any
harsh
mean
of
retaliation
,
they
invent
a
method
of
disappointing
and
disgrace
their
foe
,
and
immediately
set
pipe
at
work
to
forward
the
preparation
.
    
<EOS>
Miss
Pickle
have
describe
the
spot
which
the
assassin
have
pitch
upon
for
the
scene
of
their
vengeance
,
our
triumvirate
intend
to
have
place
a
centinel
among
the
corn
,
who
should
come
and
give
them
intelligence
when
the
ambuscade
be
lay
;
and
in
consequence
of
that
information
,
they
would
steal
softly
towards
the
place
,
attend
by
three
or
four
of
the
domestick
,
and
draw
a
large
net
over
the
conspirator
,
who
be
intangle
in
the
toil
,
should
be
disarm
,
fetter
,
heartily
scourge
,
and
suspend
between
two
tree
in
the
snare
,
as
a
spectacle
to
all
passenger
that
should
chance
to
travel
that
way
.

the
plan
be
thus

and
the
commodore
make
acquaint
with
the
whole
affair
,
the
spy
be
send
upon
duty
,
and
every
body
within
door
prepare
to
go
forth
upon
the
first
notice
.
<EOS>
one
whole
evening
do
they
spend
in
the
most
impatient
expectation
,
but
on
the
second
their
scout
creep
into
the
garison
,
and
assure
them
that
he
have
perceive
three
man
skulk
behind
the
hedge
,
on
the
road
that
lead
to
the
publick
house
from
which
Peregrine
and
the
lieutenant
use
every
night
to
return
about
that
hour
.
<EOS>
upon
this
intelligence
the
confederate
set
out
immediately
with
all
their
implement
,
and
approach
the
scene
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
they
hear
the
sound
of
blow
;
and
though
the
night
be
dark
,
perceive
a
sort
of
tumultuous
conflict
on
the
very
spot
which
the
conspirator
have
possess
.
    
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
occurrence
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
,
Peregrine

with
a
very
hearty
reception
from

to
whom
he
be
introduce
as
his
nephew

intimate

not
but
that
,
in

likelihood

he
would
have
abate
somewhat
of
his
hospitality
,
have
he
know
that
he

the
brother
of
Perry

<EOS>
in
consideration
of
this
frank
acknowledgment
,
and
a
severe
wound
he
have
receive
in
his
right
arm
,
they
resolve
to
inflict
no

punishment
on
this
malefactor

be
prepossess
in

by
this

which

so
gallantly

as

by
the
encomium
that

<EOS>
the
day
after
his
arrival
,
while
the
conversation
turn
on
this
last
subject
,
the
commodore
,
take
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
brother
,
(
say
he
)
five
and
forty
year
ago
,
when
I
be
third
lieutenant
of
the
Warwick
man
of
war
,
there
be
a
very
stout
young
fellow
on
board
,
a
subaltern
officer
of
marines
;
his
name
be
not
unlike
your
own
,
d'ye
see
,
be
Guntlet
,
with
a
G.
    
<EOS>
I
remember
he
and
I
could
not
abide
one
another
at
first
,
because
,
d'ye
see
,
I
be
a
sailor
and
he
a
land
-
man
,
till
we
fall
in
with
a
Frenchman
,
whom
we
engage
for
eight
glass
,
and
at
length
board
and
take
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
first
man
that
stand
on
the
enemy
's
deck
,
and
should
have
come
scurvily
off
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
if
Guntlet
have
not
jump
to
my
assistance
;
but
we
soon
clear
ship
,
and
drive
them
to
close
quarter
,
so
that
they
be
oblige
to
strike
;
and
from
that
day
Guntlet
and
I
be
swear
brother
as
long
as
he
remain
on
board
.
<EOS>
He
be
exchange
into
a
marching
regiment
,
and
what
become
of
him
afterwards
,
Lord
in
heaven
know
;
but
this
I
will
say
of
him
,
whether
he
be
dead
or
alive
,
he
fear
no
man
that
ever
wear
a
head
,
and
be
,
moreover
,
a
very
hearty
messmate
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
stranger
's
breast
glow
at
this
eulogium
,
which
be
no
sooner
pronounce
,
than
he
eagerly
ask
,
if
the
french
ship
be
not
the
Diligence
?
<EOS>
the
commodore
reply
with
a
stare
,
"
the
very
same
,
my
lad
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
(
say
Gauntlet
)
<EOS>
the
person
of
whom
you
be
pleased
to
make
such
honourable
mention
be
my
own
father
.
"
<EOS>
"
the
devil
he
be
!
<EOS>
(
cry
Trunnion
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
)
<EOS>
I
be
rejoice
to
see
a
son
of
Ned
Gauntlet
in
my
house
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
discovery
introduce
a
thousand
question
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
the
old
gentleman
learn
the
situation
of
his
friend
's
family
,
and
discharge
innumerable
execration
upon
the
ingratitude
and
injustice
of
the
ministry
,
which
have
fail
to
provide
for
the
son
of
such
a
brave
soldier
.
    
<EOS>
nor
be
his
friendship
confine
to
such
ineffectual
expression
;
he
that
same
evening
signify
to
Peregrine
a
desire
of
do
something
for
his
friend
;
and
this
inclination
be
so
much
praise
,
encouraged
and
promote
by
his
godson
,
and
even
support
by
his
counsellor
Hatchway
,
that
our
hero
be
empower
to
present
him
with
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
purchase
a
commission
.
    
<EOS>
though
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
Pickle
than
this
permission
,
he
be
afraid
that
Godfrey
's
scrupulous
disposition
would
hinder
him
from
subject
himself
to
any
such
obligation
;
and
therefore
propose
that
he
should
be
decoy
into
his
own
interest
by
a
feign
story
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
would
be
prevail
upon
to
accept
of
the
money
,
as
a
debt
which
the
commodore
have
contract
of
his
father
at
sea
.
<EOS>
trunnion
make
wry
face
at
this
expedient
,
the
necessity
of
which
he
could
not
conceive
,
without
call
in
question
the
common
sense
of
Gauntlet
,
as
he
take
it
for
grant
,
that
such
offer
as
those
be
not
to
be
reject
on
any
consideration
whatever
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
could
not
digest
an
artifice
,
by
which
he
himself
must
own
that
he
have
live
so
many
year
,
without
manifest
the
least
intention
of
do
justice
to
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
all
these
objection
,
however
,
be
remove
by
the
zeal
and
rhetoric
of
Peregrine
,
who
represent
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
befriend
him
on
any
other
term
;
that
his
silence
hitherto
would
be
impute
to
his
want
of
information
touch
the
circumstance
and
condition
of
his
friend
;
and
that
his
remembring
and
insist
upon
discharge
the
obligation
,
after
such
an
interval
of
time
,
when
the
whole
affair
be
in
oblivion
,
would
be
the
great
compliment
he
could
pay
to
his
own
honour
and
integrity
.
    
<EOS>
thus
persuade
,
he
take
an
opportunity
of
Gauntlet
's
be
alone
with
him
to
broach
the
affair
,
tell
the
young
man
,
that
his
father
have
advance
a
sum
of
money
for
him
,
when
they
sail
together
,
on
account
of
the
mess
,
as
well
as
to
stop
the
mouth
of
a
clamorous
creditor
at
Portsmouth
;
and
that
the
say
sum
,
with
interest
,
amount
to
about
four
hundred
pound
,
which
he
would
now
,
with
great
thankfulness
,
repay
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
be
amazed
at
this
declaration
,
and
after
a
considerable
pause
reply
,
that
he
have
never
hear
his
parent
mention
any
such
debt
;
that
no
memorandum
or
voucher
of
it
be
find
among
his
father
's
paper
;
and
that
,
in
all
probability
,
it
must
have
be
discharge
long
ago
,
although
the
commodore
,
in
such
a
long
course
of
time
and
hurry
of
occupation
,
may
have
forget
the
repayment
:
he
therefore
desire
to
be
excuse
from
accept
what
in
his
own
conscience
he
believe
be
not
his
due
;
and
compliment
the
old
gentleman
upon
his
be
so
scrupulously
just
and
honourable
.
    
<EOS>
the
soldier
's
refusal
,
which
be
matter
of
astonishment
to
Trunnion
,
increase
his
inclination
to
assist
him
;
and
,
on
pretence
of
acquit
his
own
character
,
he
urge
his
beneficence
with
such
obstinacy
,
that
Gauntlet
,
afraid
of
disoblige
him
,
be
in
a
manner
compel
to
receive
a
draught
for
the
money
,
for
which
he
subscribe
an
ample
discharge
,
and
immediately
transmit
the
order
to
his
mother
,
whom
at
the
same
time
he
inform
of
the
circumstance
by
which
they
have
so
unexpectedly
gain
this
accession
of
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
piece
of
news
could
not
fail
of
be
agreeable
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
who
by
the
first
post
write
a
polite
letter
of
acknowledgment
to
the
commodore
,
another
to
her
own
son
,
import
,
that
she
have
already
send
the
draught
to
a
friend
in
London
,
with
direction
to
deposit
it
in
the
hand
of
a
certain
banker
,
for
the
purchase
of
the
first
ensigncy
to
be
sell
;
and
she
take
the
liberty
of
send
a
third
to
Peregrine
,
couch
in
very
affectionate
term
,
with
a
kind
postscript
,
sign
by
Miss
Sophy
and
his
charming
Emily
.
    
<EOS>
this
affair
be
transact
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concern
,
preparation
be
set
on
foot
for
the
departure
of
our
hero
,
on
whom
his
uncle
settle
an
annuity
of
eight
hundred
pound
,
be
little
less
than
one
half
of
his
whole
income
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
indeed
the
old
gentleman
could
easily
afford
to
alienate
such
a
part
of
his
fortune
,
because
he
entertain
little
or
no

,
keep

remarkably
plain

frugal

side
of

and
tho

avarice

Chapter
XXXIV
<EOS>
the
two
young
gentleman
display
their
talent
for
gallantry
,
in
the
course
of
which
they
be
involve
in
a
ludicrous
circumstance
of
distress
,
and
afterwards
take
vengeance
on
the
author
of
their
mishap
.
   
<EOS>
mean
while
our
hero
and
his
new
friend
,
together
with
honest
Jack
Hatchway
,
make
daily
excursion
into
the
country
,
visit
the
gentleman
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
frequently
accompany
them
to
the
chace
;
all
three
be
exceedingly
caress
on
account
of
their
talent
,
which
could
accommodate
themselves
with
great
facility
to
the
temper
and
turn
of
their
entertainer
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
be
a
droll
in
his
way
,
Peregrine
possess
a
great
fund
of
sprightliness
and
good
humour
,
and
Godfrey
,
among
his
other
qualification
already
recite
,
sing
a
most
excellent
song
;
so
that
the
company
of
this
triumvirate
be
court
in
all
party
,
whether
male
or
female
;
and
if
the
heart
of
our
young
gentleman
have
not
be
pre
-
engaged
,
they
would
have
meet
with
opportunity
in
abundance
of
display
their
address
in
the
art
of
love
;
<EOS>
not
but
that
they
give
a
loose
to
their
gallantry
without
much
interesting
their
affection
,
and
amuse
themselves
with
little
intrigue
,
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
of
pleasure
,
do
not
affect
his
fidelity
to
the
acknowledge
sovereign
of
his
soul
.
    
<EOS>
have
they
use
those
advantage
which
their
skill
and
accomplishment
give
them
over
the
warm
unpractised
mind
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
they
have
access
,
almost
every
family
in
the
county
,
may
have
have
cause
to
rue
their
acquaintance
;
but
our
adventurer
,
wild
and
licentious
as
they
be
,
govern
their
action
by
certain
notion
of
honour
,
which
they
never
presume
to
infringe
,
and
therefore
,
no
domestic
tragedy
take
rise
from
their
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
among
the
low
class
of
people
,
they
do
not
act
with
the
same
virtuous
moderation
,
but
lay
close
siege
to
every
buxom
country
damsel
that
fall
in
their
way
;
imagine
that
their
dalliance
with
such
dulcinea
could
produce
no
fatal
effect
;
and
that
it
would
be
in
their
power
to
attone
for
any
damage
these
inamorata
's
may
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
prosecution
of
these
amour
,
Gauntlet
could
not
help
discover
a
particular
biass
towards
married
woman
,
and
when
question
by
his
friend
,
defend
his
singularity
of
taste
,
by
observe
that
such
connection
,
if
discreetly
manage
,
be
attend
by
none
of
those
bad
consequence
which
commonly
pursue
an
amorous
correspondence
with
single
person
;
because
the
wedded
dame
's
fortune
be
already
make
,
and
her
husband
stand
as
a
buttress
before
her
reputation
.
    
<EOS>
though
Peregrine
could
not
approve
of
this
maxim
which
the
soldier
have
adopt
in
the
course
of
a
military
education
,
he
could
not
avoid
engage
as
a
second
and
confidant
to
his
friend
,
in
an
intrigue
which
he
carry
on
with
a
farmer
's
wife
in
the
neighbourhood
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
have
practise
all
his
art
in
attempt
to
overcome
the
chastity
of
this
woman
,
who
be
an
hale
rosy
wench
,
lately
married
;
and
at
length
succeed
so
far
in
his

that
she
promise
to
admit
him
one
night
when
her

absent
on
business

once
a

his
good

desire
that
he
would
accompany
him
to
the
place

in

of
accident

our
young

have
undertake
the
office
of

centinel
over
his

while
he
should
enjoy
his
conquest
,
they
set
out
at
the
time
appoint
,
and
arrive
at
the
door
,
the
gallant
make
the
signal
which
have
be
agree
upon
,
and
be
let
in
accordingly
,
after
have
assure
his
confidant
that
he
would
be
with
him
again
in
two
hour
at
farthest
.
    
<EOS>
thus
leave
to
his
own
meditation
,
our
hero
begin
his
patrole
,
beguile
the
time
with
the
most
amusing
fancy
of
a
glowing
imagination
,
and
enjoy
by
anticipation
all
the
pleasure
attend
affluence
and
youth
,
till
at
length
his
reverie
be
interrupt
by
a
plump
shower
that
compel
him
to
seek
for
shelter
in
a
sort
of
shed
,
the
door
of
which
stand
open
to
his
view
.
<EOS>
thither
therefore
he
betake
himself
,
and
grope
about
as
he
enter
in
the
dark
,
chance
to
lay
hold
on
a
bushy
beard
,
to
his
infinite
surprize
and
consternation
.
<EOS>
before
he
have
time
to
form
any
conjecture
concern
this
strange
object
of
his
touch
,
he
receive
a
sudden
shock
upon
his
forehead
that
fell
him
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
,
and
as
he
lie
,
undergo
the
trampling
of
a
huge
body
that
rush
over
him
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
in
this
attitude
he
remain
extended
for
the
space
of
several
minute
,
before
he
recover
the
use
of
sensation
which
he
have
lose
,
and
then
he
perceive
the
blood
trickle
down
from
his
temple
in
a
double
stream
.
    
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
misfortune
be
still
a
mystery
to
him
,
and
he
make
shift
to
rise
,
curse
his
fate
for
have
sustain
such
visible
mark
of
disgrace
in
the
exercise
of
such
a
ridiculous
office
;
when
stroll
about
with
his
handkerchief
apply
to
his
hurt
,
he
discern
on
the
farther
side
of
a
tree
a
pair
of
large
eye
glance
like
two
coal
of
fire
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
unsheathe
his
hanger
,
in
the
belief
that
now
he
have
find
the
author
of
his
mischance
;
and
spring
forward
on
his
adversary
,
aim
a
furious
stroke
that
enter
the
body
of
the
tree
,
in
which
his
weapon
stick
so
fast
,
that
he
could
not
disengage
it
without
some
difficulty
;
while
the
object
of
his
wrath
make
a
precipitate
retreat
,
and
by
an
exclamation
,
give
him
to
know
that
his
assailant
be
no
other
than
an
he
-
goat
.
    
<EOS>
Mad
as
he
be
with
indignation
and
shame
,
he
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
ludicrous
adventure
,
and
have
just
set
his
invention
at
work
to
find
some
plausible
excuse
which
he
may
make
to
the
world
,
for
the
patch
he
know
he
must
wear
on
his
face
,
when
a
window
of
the
first
story
fly
open
,
he
see
something
white
descend
with
astonishing
velocity
,
and
run
to
the
spot
,
find
his
friend
Godfrey
nake
to
the
shirt
.
<EOS>
confound
at
his
condition
,
he
begin
to
inquire
into
the
reason
of
his
precipitation
,
but
receive
no
answer
until
he
have
follow
the
fugitive
to
a
place
where
they
could
not
be
overhear
.
    
<EOS>
there
he
understand
that
the
soldier
have
be
decoy
into
the
snare
by
the
connivance
of
the
husband
,
by
whose
direction
he
have
(
without
all
doubt
)
be
admit
not
only
into
the
house
,
but
even
into
his
wife
's
own
bed
,
where
the
jilt
have
leave
him
undress
,
on
pretence
of
fasten
the
door
,
but
in
reality
with
a
view
of
give
the
hint
to
the
farmer
,
who
arm
with
a
pitchfork
and
support
by
his
man
,
enter
the
room
before
he
be
aware
,
secure
his
sword
and
cloath
,
and
oblige
him
to
take
refuge
in
a
closet
,
from
the
window
of
which
he
have
throw
himself
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
resentment
of
the
boor
,
and
the
disgrace
as
well
as
expence
of
be
take
in
that
situation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
tempt
to
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
issue
of
this
adventure
,
but
restrain
himself
in
consideration
of
his
friend
's
temper
and
condition
,
neither
of
which
be
at
that
time
proper
object
of
mirth
;
and
strip
off
his
own
coat
,
accommodate
Godfrey
's
naked
shoulder
;
then
after
mature
deliberation
,
they
determine
to
leave
the
spoil
in
the
hand
of
the
enemy
,
because
they
foresaw
it
would
be
altogether
impracticable
to
retrieve
it
,
as
well
as
hazardous
both
to
their
person
and
reputation
,
to
make
any
attempt
towards
the
recovery
of
what
be
lose
;
the
two
friend
,
therefore
,
make
their
retreat
in
this
trim
to
the
garison
,
and
the
farmer
remain
in
possession
of
all
the
soldier
's
cloath
,
sword
and
ready
money
,
to
the
amount
of
ten
pound
.
<EOS>
but
here
the
disaster
do
not
end
,
the
malicious
peasant
propagate
the
whole
story
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
an
advertisement
be

on
the

for
the
perusal
of

whole
parish

give
a
description
of

place
where
they

and
offer
to
restore
them
to
any
person
who
should
prove
himself
the
right
owner
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
mortifying
joke
to
Gauntlet
,
who
be
ashamed
to
shew
himself
for
a
whole
week
;
nor
be
Peregrine
exempt
from
a
share
of
the
disgrace
,
to
which
he
be
expose
by
the
mark
on
his
forehead
,
that
confine
him
also
to
the

and
subject
him
to
the
ridicule
of
the
commodore

who
have

rally
the

,
observe
that
it
be
well
<EOS>
Gauntlet

mast
have
not
go
along
with
his

;
and
ask
if
the
cuckold

have
run
foul
of
Peregrine

bow
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
chance
to
be
present
,
very
demurely
check
her
husband
for
his
profane
scoffing
,
and
in
a
severe
lecture
,
rebuke
the
young
man
for
their
profligate
course
,
which
,
if
they
be
not
relinquish
in
time
,
would
bring
their
body
into
trouble
in
this
life
,
and
their
soul
into
perdition
in
that
which
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
while
these
fellow

sufferer
be
oblige
to
keep
within

they
hold
frequent
consultation
with
the
lieutenant
,
concern
some
mean
of
revenge
,
which
the
soldier
be
bent
upon
take
;
because
he
could
not
forgive
the
double
dealing
of
his
mistress
,
who
,
he
think

may
have
decline
his
solicitation
,
without
inveigle
him
into
such
a
disgraceful
situation

<EOS>
after
much
deliberation

they
resolve
to
wait
patiently
,
and
watch
for
the
husband

absence
,
when
by
a
stratagem
they

they
would
endeavour
to
obtain
admittance

and
punish
the

perfidy
,
by
fix
her
as
a
monument

with
her
posterior
thrust
out
at
a
window
,
for
the
contemplation
of
her
spouse
when
he
should
return
in
the
morning

<EOS>
the
plan
be
lay
<EOS>

Peregrine
find
mean
to
make
himself
acquaint
with
the
farmer
's
voice
and
manner
of
speaking
,
which
he

one
night
at
Tunley

and
he
propose

of
accommodation

some
seem
reluctance

a
more
agreeable

an
intimation
from
his
sister
,
that
she
should
be
overjoy
to
meet
him
next
day
,
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
at
the
house
of
her
nurse
,
who
live
in
a
cottage
hard
by
her
father
's
habitation
,
she
be
debar
from
all
opportunity
of
see
him
in
any
other
place
by
the
severity
of
her
mother
,
who
suspect
her
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
obey
the
summon
,
and
go
at
the
time
appoint
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
he
meet
this
affectionate
young
lady
,
who
when
he
enter
the
room
,
run
towards
him
with
all
the
eagerness
of
transport
;
fling
her
arm
about
his
neck
,
and
shed
a
flood
of
tear
in
his
bosom
before
she
could
utter
one
word
,
except
a
repetition
of
my
dear
,
dear
brother
!
<EOS>
He
embrace
her
with
all
the
piety
of
fraternal
tenderness
,
weep
over
her
in
his
turn
,
assure
her
that
this
be
one
of
the
happy
moment
of
his
life

and
kindly
thank
her
for
have
resist
the
example
,
and
disobey
the
injunction
of
his
mother
's
unnatural
aversion
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
ravish
to
find
by
her
conversation
,
that
she
possess
a
great
share
of
sensibility
and
prudent
reflexion
;
for
she
lament
the
infatuation
of
her
parent
with
the
most
filial
regret
,
and
express
such
abhorrence
and
concern
at
the
villainous
disposition
of
her
young
brother
,
as
a
humane
sister
may
be
suppose
to
have
entertain
.
<EOS>
He
make
her
acquaint
with
all
the
circumstance
of
his
own
fortune

and
as
he
suppose
she

her
time
very
disagreeably
at
home
,
among
character
which
must
be
shockingly
interesting
,
profess
a
desire
of
move
her
into
some
other
sphere
,
where
she
could
live
with
more
tranquillity
and
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
She
object
to
this
proposal
as
an
expedient
that
would
infallibly
subject
her
to
the
implacable
resentment
of
her
mother
,
whose
favour
and
affection
she
at
present
enjoy
but
in
a
very
inconsiderable
degree
;
and
they

first
discharge
of
her
fury
.
    
<EOS>
Her

with
all
the
rage
of
indignation
,
which
choake
up
her
utterance

and
seem
to

her
whole
frame

she

her

in
his

,
and
with
the
other
buffet

about
the
face
,
till
the

if
he

and
have

then

throw
him
out
at

house
;
in

and

the
censure
of

world
,
which
from
her
mother

misrepresentation
she
be
sensible
would
condemn
her
unheard

her

wrath
with
humiliation

rigour
of
this

by
the

submissive

reasonable
remonstrance

as
in

vindication
she
of
necessity
espouse
her

her

the

hear
these

tremble
with
resentment

assure
the

without

your
diabolic
rancour

be
severely
punish

I
bless
God

because

humane

you
reject
her
as
an
alien

turn
her
out
unprovided

a
barbarous
world

there
your

He
could
not
endure
the

he
be
afraid

for

the

seem
conscious
of
this
advantage

now
gain
over

,
be
as
much
chagrin
at
the
news
of
Julia
's
reception

She
even
torture

invention

propagate
calumny

reputation

up
a
rebellion

impute
the
hospitality

inveterate
enmity

peremptory
term
,
upon
her
husband
's
renounce
all
commerce
with
the
old
lad
of
the
castle

his
adherent

Mr
Gamaliel
have
by
this
time
contract
other
friendship

readily
submit
to
her
will
,

even
refuse
to
communicate

one
night

chapter
XXXVI
<EOS>
the
commodore
send
a
challenge
to
Gamaliel
,
and
be
impose
upon
by
a
waggish
invention
of
the
lieutenant
,
Peregrine
and
Gauntlet
.
   
<EOS>
this
affront
trunnion
could
by
no
means
digest
<EOS>
:
he
advise
with
the
lieutenant
upon
the
subject
;
and
the
result
of
their
consultation
be
a
defiance
which
the
old
commander
send
to
Pickle
,
demand
that
he
would
meet
him
at
such
a
place
on
horseback
with
a
brace
of
pistol
,
and
give
satisfaction
for
the
slight
he
have
put
upon
him
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
could
have
afford
more
pleasure
to
Jack
,
than
the
acceptance
of
this
challenge
,
which
he
deliver
verbally
to
Mr
Gamaliel
,
who
be
call
out
from
the
club
at
Tunley
's
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
this
message
have
an
instantaneous
effect
upon
the
constitution
of
the
pacific
Pickle
,
whose
bowel
yearn
with
apprehension
,
and
undergo
such
violent
agitation
on
the
spot
,
that
one
would
have
think
the
operation
proceed
from
some
severe
joke
of
the
apothecary
which
he
have
swallow
in
his
beer
.
    
<EOS>
the
messenger
despair
of
a
satisfactory
answer
,
leave
him
in
this
woeful
condition
;
and
be
loath
to
lose
any
opportunity
of
raise
the
laugh
against
the
commodore
,
go
immediately
and
communicate
the
whole
affair
to
the
young
gentleman
,
intreate
them
,
for
the
love
of
God
,
to
concert
some
mean
of
bring
old
Hannibal
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
the
two
friend
relish
the
proposal
,
and
after
some
deliberation
,
it
be
resolve
that
Hatchway
should
tell
trunnion
his
invitation
be
accept
by
Gamaliel
,
who
would
meet
him
at
the
place
appoint
,
with
his
second
,
to
-
morrow
in
the
twilight
,
because
if
either
should
fall
,
the
other
would
have
the
well
chance
for
escape
in
the
dark
;
that
Godfrey
should
personate
old
Pickle
's
friend
,
and
Peregrine
represent
his
own
father
,
while
the
lieutenant
should
take
care
in
load
the
pistol
to
keep
out
the
shot
,
so
as
that
no
damage
may
be
do
in
the
rencounter
.
    
<EOS>
these
circumstance
be
adjust
,
the
lieutenant
return
to
his
principal
with
a
most
thundering
reply
from
his
antagonist
,
whose
courageous
behaviour
,
though
it
could
not
intimidate
,
do
not
fail
to
astonish
the
commodore
,
who
ascribe
it
to
the
spirit
of
his
wife
,
which
have
inspire
him
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
that
instant
desire
his
counsellor
to
prepare
his
cartridge
-
box
,
and
order
the
quiet
horse
in
the
stable
to
be
keep
ready
saddle
for
the
occasion
;
his
eye
seem
to
lighten
with
alacrity
and
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
smell
gun
-
powder
once
more
before
his
death
;
and
when
Jack
advise
him
to
make
his
will
,
in
case
of
accident
,
he
reject
his
counsel
with
disdain
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
what

Hawser
Trunnion

Thou

how
I

"
next
day
Peregrine
and
the
soldier
provide
themselves
with
horse
at
the
public
house
,
from
whence
,
at
the
destine
hour
,
they
ride
to
the
field
of
battle
,
each
of
them
be
muffle
in
a
great
coat
,
which
,
with
the
dimness
of
the
light
,
effectually
shield
them
from
the
knowledge
of
the
one
-
eyed
commander
,
who
have
take
horse
,
on
pretence
of
enjoy
the
fresh
air
,
soon
appear
with
Hatchway
in
his
rear

<EOS>
when
they

and
that
if
neither

decisive
,
recourse
must
be
have
to
the
broad

sword
,
in
order
to
ascertain
the
victory
.
<EOS>
these
article
be
settle
,
the
opponent
ride
forward
to
their
respective
station
,
when
Peregrine
cock
his
pistol
,
and
present
,
counterfeit
his
father
's
voice
,
and
bad
trunnion
take
care
of
his
remain
eye
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
take
his
advice
,
be
unwilling
to
hazard
his
day
-
light
,
and
very
deliberately
oppose
the
patched
side
of
his
face
to
the
muzzle
of
his
antagonist
's
piece
,
desire
him
to
do
his
duty
without
further
jaw
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
man
accordingly
fire
,
and
the
distance
be
small
,
the
wad
of
his
pistol
take
place
with
a
smart
stroke
on
the
forehead
of
trunnion
,
who
mistake
it
for
the
ball
,
which
he
think
be
lodge
in
his
brain
,
spur
up
his
steed
in
a
state
of
desperation
towards
his
antagonist
,
and
hold
his
piece
within
two
yard
of
his
body
,
let
it
off
,
without
any
regard
to
the
law
of
battle
.
<EOS>
surprised
and
enrage
to
see
it
have
make
no
impression
,
he
hollow
in
a
terrible
tone
,
"
o
!
<EOS>
damn
ye
,
you
have
get
your
netting
stuff
,
I
see
;
"
and
advance
,
discharge
his
second
pistol
so
near
his
godson
's
head
,
that
have
he
not
be
defend
by
his
great
coat
,
the
powder
must
have
scorch
his

<EOS>
have
thus
throw
away
his
fire
,
he
remain
at
the
mercy
of
Peregrine
,
who
clap
the
piece
he
have
in
reserve
to
his
head
,
command
him
to
beg
his
life
,
and
ask
pardon
for
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
the
commodore
make
no
reply
to
this
imperious
injunction
,
but
drop
his
pistol
,
and
unsheathe
his
broad
-
sword
with
a
jirk
,
attack
our
hero
with
such
incredible
agility
,
that
if
he
have
not
make
shift
to
ward
off
the
stroke
with
his
piece
,
the
adventure
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
have
turn
out
a
very
tragical
joke
.
<EOS>
peregrine
find
it
would
be
in
vain
for
him
to
think
of
draw
his
weapon
,
and
stand
on
the
defensive
against
this
furious
aggressor
,
very
fairly
clapt
spur
to
his
nag

and
seek
his
safety
in
flight

<EOS>
trunnion
pursue
him
with
infinite
eagerness
,
and
his
steed
be
the
well
of

would
have
overtake

unfortunately
encounter
by
the
bough
of
a
tree
that
happen
to
stand
on
his
blind
side

and
incommode
him
so
much

that
he
be
fain
to
quit
his
sword
,
and
lie
hold
on
the
mane
,
in
order
to
maintain
his
seat
.
    
<EOS>
Perry
perceive
his
disaster
,
wheel
about
,
and
now
find
leisure
to
produce
his
weapon
,
return
upon
his
disarm
foe
,
and
brandish
his
Ferrara
,
<EOS>
threaten
to
make
him
short
by
the
head
,
if
he
would
not
immediately
crave
quarter
,
and
yield
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
farth
from
the
intention
of
the
old
gentleman
than
such
submission
,
which
he
flatly
refuse
to
pay
,
alledge
that
he
have
already
compel
his
enemy
to
clap
on
all
his
sail
,
and
that
his
own
present
misfortune
be
owe
to
accident
,
all
one
as
if
a
ship
should
be
attack
,
after
she
have
be
oblige
to
heave
her
gun
over
-
board
in
a
storm

<EOS>
before
Peregrine
have
time
to
answer
this
remonstrance
,
the
lieutenant
interpose
,
and
take
cognizance
of
the
case
,
establish
a
truce
,
until
he
and
the
other
second
should
discuss
and
decide
upon
the
merit
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
retire
to
a
small
distance
,
and
after
have
confer
a
few
minute
,
Hatchway
return
,
and
pronounce
the
commodore
vanquish
by
the
chance
of
war
.
    
<EOS>
never
be
rage
more
transporting
than
that
which
take
possession
of
old
Hannibal
,
when
he
hear
the
sentence
;
it
be
some
time
before
he
could
utter
aught
,
except
the
reproachful
expression
,
You
lie
!
<EOS>
which
he
repeat
more
than
twenty
time
,
in
a
sort
of
delirious
insensibility
;
and
when
he
recover
the
further
use
of
speech
,
abuse
the
arbitrator
with
such
bitter
invective
,
renounce
their
sentence
,
and
appeal
to
another
trial
,
that
the
confederate
begin
to
repent
of
have
carry
the
joke
so
far
;
and
Peregrine
,
in
order
to
appease
his
choler
,
own
himself
overcome
.
    
<EOS>
this
acknowledgement
calm
the
tumult
of
his
wrath
,
though
he
could
not
for
some
day
forgive
the
lieutenant

reconducte
him
to

growl
all
the

before
God

I
think
the

head
be
make
of
a

for
my
shot
rebound
from
his

like
a

I
will
be
damn
if
I
have
not
snapt
his

in

and
mayhap
let
out
his

water
into
the

<EOS>
He
seem

vain
of
this
exploit
,
which
dwelt
upon
his
imagination
,
and
be
cherish
as
the

for
though
he
could
not
with
decency
rehearse
it
to
the
young

and
his

at
supper
,
he
give
shrewd
hint
of
his
own
manhood
,
even
at
these
year
,
and
attest
Hatchway
as
a
voucher
for
his

Our

<EOS>
when

and
thus
the
cavalcade
set
out
on
the
road
to
Dover
.
<EOS>
as
the
commodore
could
not
bear
the
fatigue
of

,
they
travel
at
an
easy
pace
during

first
stage
;
so
that
the
old
gentleman
have
an
opportunity
of
communicate
his
exhortation
to

with

weather
of
the
french
politesse
,
which
be
no
more
to
be
trust
than
a
whirlpool
at

.
<EOS>
He
observe
that
many
young
man
have
go
to
Paris
with
good
cargo
of
sense
,
and
return
with
a
great
deal
of
canvas
,
and
no
ballast
at
all
,
whereby
they
become
crank
all
the
day
of
their
life
,
and
sometimes
carry
their
keel
above
water
.
<EOS>
He
desire
Mr
Jolter
to
keep
his
pupil
out
of
the
clutch
of
those
shark

who
lie
in
wait
to

of
all
young

and
in
a
particular
manner
caution
the
youth
against
carnal
conversation
with
the
parisian

who

he
understand
,
be
no
well
than
gaudy
fire

and

<EOS>
Peregrine
listen
with
great
respect
,
thank
him
for
his
kind
admonition
,
which
he
faithfully
promise
to
observe
.
<EOS>
They
halt
and
breakfast
at
the
end
of
the
stage
,
where
Jolter
provide
himself
with
a
horse
,
and
the

and
the

"
I

and
God

<EOS>
He
then
remind
Gauntlet
of
his
promise
to
call
at
the
garison
in
his
return
from
Dover
,
and
impart
something
in

to
the

Jack
Hatchway

and
squeeze
Peregrine
by
the
hand
,
give
him
an
iron
pistol
of
curious
workmanship
,
as
a
memorial
of
his

<EOS>
Our

who
be
not

Godfrey

be
thus
disposed
,
and
a
servant
employ
in

cloth
,
their
ear
be
of
a
sudden
invade
by
a
strange
tumultuous
noise
in
the

,
occasion
by
the
overthrow
of
table

chair
and
glass
,
with
odd
unintelligible
exclamation
in
break
French

and
a
jargon
of
threat
in
the
Welsh
dialect
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
run
immediately
into
the
apartment
from
whence
this
clamour
seem
to
proceed
,
and
find
a
thin
meagre
swarthy
figure
gasp
in
all
the
agony
of
fear
,
under
the
hand
of
a
squat
,
thick
,
hard

featured
man
,
who
collar
him
with
great
demonstration
of
wrath
,
say
,
"
if

mighty
a
magician
as
Owen
Glendower

or
the

look
you

or
as

Shentlemens

turn
to

,
I
take
you
to
witness
that
I
protest
and
assert
and
avow
that
this

as
pig
a

as

I
supplicate

may
be

look
you
;
for
as
I
be
a
christian
soul
,
and
hope
for
joyful

<EOS>
,
I
have
this
plesse
evening
see
him
perform
such
thing
as
could
not
be
do
without
the
aid
and
instruction
and
connivance
of

"
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
seem
to
enter
into
the
sentiment
of
this
Welch
reformer
,
and
actually
lay
hold
on
the
delinquent
's
shoulder
,
cry
,
"
damn
the
rascal
!
<EOS>
I
will
lay
any
wager
that
he
be
a
jesuit
;
for
none
of
his
order
travel
without
a
familiar
.
"
    
<EOS>
but
Peregrine
,
who
look
upon
the
affair
in
another
point
of
view
,
interpose
in
behalf
of
the
stranger
,
whom
he
free
from
his
aggressor
,
observe
that
there
be
no
occasion
to
use
violence
,
and
ask
in
French
what
he
have
do
to
incur
the
censure
of
the
informer
.
<EOS>
the
poor
foreigner
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
answer
that
he
be
an
italian
charlatan
,
who
have
practise
with
some
reputation
in
Padua
,
until
he
have
the
misfortune
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
Inquisition
,
by
exhibit
certain
wonderful
performance
by
his
skill
in
natural
knowledge
,
which
that
tribunal
consider
as
the
effect
of
sorcery
,
and
persecute
him
accordingly
;
so
that
he
have
be
fain
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
into
France
,
where
not
find
his
account
in
his
talent
,
he
be
now
arrive
in
England
,
with
a
view
of
practise
his
art
in
London
;
and
that
in
consequence
of
a
speciman
which
he
have
give
to
a
company
below
,
the
choleric
gentleman
have
follow
him
up
stair
to
his
own
apartment
,
and
assault
him
in
that
inhospitable
manner
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
earnestly
beg
that
our
hero
would
take
him
under
his
protection
;
and
if
he
entertain
the
least
suspicion
of
his
employing
preternatural
mean
in
the
operation
of
his
art
,
he
would
freely
communicate
all
the
secret
in
his
possession
.
    
<EOS>
the
youth
dispel
his
apprehension
,
by
assure
him
that
he
be
in
no
danger
of
suffer
for
his
art
in
England
,
where
,
if
ever
he
should
be
question
by
the
zeal
of
superstitious
individual
,
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
appeal
to
the
next
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
would
immediately
acquit
him
of
the
charge
,
and
punish
his
accuser
for
their
impertinence
and
indiscretion
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
tell
Gauntlet
and
the
Welshman
,
that
the
stranger
have
a
good
action
against
them
for
an
assault
,
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
parliament
,
which
make
it
criminal
for
any
person
to
accuse
another
of
sorcery
and
witchcraft

these
idle

justly
explode
by
all

.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
who
have
by
this

the
company
,
could
not
help
signify
his
dissent
from
this
opinion
of
his
pupil
,
which
he
endeavour
to
invalidate
by
the
authority
of
scripture

quotation
from

with

that
he

Mr

gravity

answer
,
"
Mr
Rantum
,
my
goot
sir
,
I
believe
upon
my
conscience
and
salfation
,
be
my
very
goot
frient
and
wellwisher
;
and
he
and
I
have
be
companion
and
messmate
and
fellow
-
sufferer
,
look
you
;
but
nevertheless
,
for
all
that
,
peradventure
,
he
hath
not
pehave
with
so
much
complaisance
and
affability
and
respect
,
as
I
may
have
expect
from
him
;
pecause
he
hath
reveal
and
tivulge
and
buplishe
our
private
affair
,
without
my
knowledge
and
privity
and
consent
;
but
as
Got
be
my
safiour
,
I
think
he
have
no
evil
intention
in
his
pelly
;
and
though
there
be
certain
person
,
look
you
,
who
,
as
I
be
tell
,
take
upon
them
to
laugh
at
his
description
of
my
person
,
deportment
and
conversation
,
I
do
affirm
and
maintain
,
and
insist
with
my
heart
,
and
my
plood
and
my
soul
,
that
those
person
be
no
petter
than
ignorant
ass
,
and
that
they
know
not
how
to
discern
and
distinguish
and
define
true
ridicule
,
or
as
Aristotle
call
it
,
the
to
geloion
,
no
more
,
look
you
,
than
a
herd
of
mountain
goat
;
for
I
will
make
pold
to
observe
,
and
I
hope
this
goot
company
will
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
that
there
be
nothing
say
of
me
in
that
performance
,
which
be
unworthy
of
a
christian
and
a
shentleman
.

<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
and
his

acquiesce
in
the
justness
of
his
observation

and
Peregrine

assure
him
,
that
from

the
book

he

conceive
the
utmost
regard

veneration
for
his

this
opportunity
of
enjoy
his

Scarce
have
the

proceed
two
league
on
the
passage
,
when
the
wind
shifting
,
blow
directly
in
their
tooth
;
so
that
they
be
oblige
to
haul
upon
a
wind
,
and
alter
their
course
;
and
the
sea
run
pretty
high
at
the
same
time
,
our
hero
,
who
be
below
in
his
cabbin
,
begin
to
be
squeamish
,
and
in
consequence
of
the
skipper
's
advice
,
go
upon
deck
for
the
comfort
of
his
stomach
;
while
the
governor
,
experience
in
these
disaster
,
slipt
into
bed
,
where
he
lie
at
his
ease
,
amuse
himself
with
a
treatise
on
the
Cycloid
,
with
algebraical
demonstration
,
which
never
fail
to
engage
his
imagination
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
the
wind
increase
to
a
very
hard
gale
,
the
vessel
pitch
with
great
violence
,
the
sea
wash
over
the
deck
,
the
master
be
alarm
,
the
crew
be
confound
,
the
passenger
be
overwhelmed
with
sickness
and
fear
,
and
universal
distraction
ensue
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
uproar
,
Peregrine
hold
fast
by
the
taffril
,
and
look
ruefully
ahead
,
the
countenance
of
Pipes
present
itself
to
his
astonished
view
,
rise
as
it
be
from
the
hold
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
imagine
it
be
a
fear
-
form
shadow
of
his
own
brain
;
though
he
do
not
long
remain
in
this
error
,
but
plainly
perceive
that
it
be
no
other
than
the
real
person
of
Thomas
,
who
jump
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
take
charge
of
the
helm
,
and
dictate
to
the
sailor
with
as
much
authority
as
if
he
have
be
commander
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
the
skipper
look
upon
him
as
an
angel
send
to
his
assistance
,
and
the
crew
soon
discover
him
to
be
a
thorough
-
breed
seaman
,
notwithstanding
his
livery
-
frock
,
obey
his
order
with
such
alacrity
that
in
a
little
time
the
confusion
vanish
,
and
every
necessary
step
take
to
weather
the
gale
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
immediately
conceive
the
meaning
of
Tom
's
appearance
on
board
,
and
when
the
tumult
be
a
little
subsided
,
go
up
and
encourage
him
to
exert
himself
for
the
preservation
of
the
ship
,
promise
to
take
him
again
into
his
service
,
from
which
he
should
never
be
dismiss
,
except
by
his
own
desire
.
    
<EOS>
this
assurance
have
a
surprising
effect
upon
Pipes
,
who
,
though
he
make
no
manner
of
reply
,
thrust
the
helm
into
the
master
's
hand
,
say
,
"
here
,
you
old
bum
-
boat
woman
,
take
hold
of
the
tiller
,
and
keep
her
thus
,
boy
,
thus
;
"
and
skip
about
the
vessel
,
trim
the
sail
,
and
manage
the
rope
with
such
agility
and
skill
,
that
every
body
on
deck
stand
amazed
at
his
dexterity
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
be
far
from
be
unconcerned
at
the
uncommon
motion
of
the
vessel
,
the
singing
of
the
wind
,
and
the
uproar
which
he
hear
above
him
;
he
look
towards
the
cabbin
-
door
with
the
most
wishful
expectation
,
in
hope
of
see
some
person
who
could
give
some
account
of
the
weather
,
and
what
be
do
upon
deck
;
but
not
a
soul
appear
,
and
he
be
too
well
acquaint
with
the
disposition
of
his
own
bowel
to
alter
his
own
attitude
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
lain
a
good
while
in
all
the
agony
of
suspence
,
the
boy
tumble
headlong
into
his
apartment
with
such
noisy
ruin
,
that
he
believe
the
mast
have
go
by
the
board
,
and
start
upright
in
his
bed
,
ask
with
all
the
symptom
of
horror
,
what
be
the
cause
of
that
disturbance
?
<EOS>
the
boy
,
half
stun
by
his
fall
,
answer
in
a
dolorous
tone
,
"
I
be
come
to

up

He
would
in

have
proceed
with
the
demonstration
of
this
proposition

have
he
not

seize
with
such
a
qualm
as
compel
him
to
drop
the
book

and
accommodate
himself
to
the
emergency

he
therefore
stretch

at
full
length

put
up
ejaculation
to
heaven
,
begin
to
prepare
himself
for
his
latter
end
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
noise

and
as
he
could
not
conceive
the
cause
of
this
tremendous
silence

he
imagine
that
either

wash
overboard

that
despairing

they
have
cease

by

which
,
however
,
be
not
altogether
unenlightened
by
some
scatter
ray
of

the

enter
the
cabbin
,
and
he
ask
with
a
voice
half
extinguish
by
fear
,
how
matter
go
upon
deck
?
<EOS>
the
skipper
,
with
a
large
bottle
of
brandy
apply
to
his
mouth
,
answer
in
a
hollow
tone
,
"
all
be
over
now
,
master

"
<EOS>
upon
which
Mr

,
give
himself
over

exclaim
with
the

"
Lord

Christ

supplication

assure
him

<EOS>
such
a
sudden
transition
from
fear
to
joy
,
occasion
a
violent
agitation
both
in
his
mind
and
body
;
and
it
be
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
recover
the
right
use
of
his
organ
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
weather
clear
up
,
the
wind
begin
to
blow
again
from
the
right
corner
,
and
the
spire
of
Calais
appear
at
the
distance
of
five
league
;
so
that
the
countenance
of
all
on
board
be
light
up
with
joyous
expectation
;
and
Peregrine
venture
to
go
down
into
the
cabbin
,
comfort
his
governor
with
an
account
of
the
happy
turn
of
their
affair
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
transport
with
the
thought
of
a
speedy
landing
,
begin
to
launch
out
in
praise
of
that
country
for
which
they
be
bind
.
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
France
be
the
land
of
politeness
and
hospitality
,
which
be
conspicuous
in
the
behaviour
of
all
rank
and
degree
,
from
the
peer
to
the
peasant
;
that
a
gentleman
and
a
foreigner
,
far
from
be
insult
and
impose
upon
by
the
low
class
of
people
,
as
in
England
,
be
treat
with
the
utmost
reverence
,
candour
and
respect
;
that
their
field
be
fertile
,
their
climate
pure
and
healthy
,
their
farmer
rich
and
industrious
,
and
the
subject
in
general
the
happy
of
man
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
prosecute
this
favourite
theme
still
farther
,
have
not
his
pupil
be
oblige
to
run
upon
deck
,
in
consequence
of
certain
warning
he
receive
from
his
stomach
.
    
<EOS>
the
skipper
see
his
condition
,
very
honestly
remind
him
of
the
cold
ham
and
fowl
,
with
a
basket
of
wine
,
which
he
have
order
to
be
send
on
board
,
and
ask
if
he
would
have
the
cloth
lay
below
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
choose
a
more
seasonable
opportunity
of
manifest
his
own
disinterestedness
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
make
wry
face
at
the
mention
of
food
,
bid
him
,
for
Christ
's
sake
,
talk
no
more
on
that
subject
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
descend
into
the
cabbin
,
and
put
the
same
question
to
Mr
Jolter
,
who
,
he
know
,
entertain
the
same
abhorrence
for
his
proposal
;
and
meet
with
the
like
reception
from
him
,
go
between
deck
,
and
repeat
his
courteous
proffer
to
the
valet
de
chambre
and
lacquey
,
who
lie
sprawl
in
all
the
pang
of
a
double
evacuation
,
and
reject
his
civility
with
the
most
horrible
loathing
.
<EOS>
thus
baffle
in
all
his
kind
endeavour
,
he
order
his
boy
to
secure
the
provision
in
one
of
his
own
locker
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
ship
;
and
he
would
have
enjoy
a
pretty
comfortable
booty
,
have
not
pipe
interpose
,
and
divide
the
store
among
the
sailor
,
who
,
he
think
,
be
most
deserving
of
such
indulgence
;
so
that
the
skipper
have
the
mortification
of
see
his
plan
miscarry
by
his
own
precipitate
conduct
;
for
,
have
he
hold
his
tongue
,
no
body
would
have
dreamt
of
ask
for
the
provision
,
and
he
would
have
possess
his
prize
in
peace
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
low
water
when
they
arrive
on
the
french
coast
,
the
vessel
could
not
enter
the
harbour
,
and
they
be
oblige
to
bring
to
,
and
wait
for
a
boat
,
which
in
less
than
half
an
hour
come
along
-
side
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
now
come
upon
deck
,
and
snuff
up
the
french
air
with
symptom
of
infinite
satisfaction
,
ask
of
the
boatman
,
with
the
friendly
appellation
of
Mes
enfan
,
what
they
must
have
for
transport
them
and
their
baggage
to
the
pier
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
disconcert
,
when
those
polite
,
candid
,
reasonable
waterman
,
demand
a
Louis
d'or
for
that
service
!
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
with
a
sarcastic
sneer
,
observe
,
that
he
already
begin
to
perceive
the
justice
of
his
encomium
on
the
French
;
and
the
disappointed
governor
could
say
nothing
in
his
own
vindication
,
but
that
they
be
debauch
by
their
intercourse
with
the
inhabitant
of
Dover
.
    
<EOS>
His
pupil
,
however
,
be
so
much
offend
at
their
extortion
,
that
he
absolutely
refuse
to
employ
them
,
even
when
they
abate
one
half
in
their
demand
,
and
swear
he
would
stay
on
board
till
the
packet
should
be
able
to
enter
the
harbour
,
rather
than
encourage
such
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
the
master
,
who
in
all
probability
have
some
sort
of
fellow
-
feeling
with
the
boatman
,
in
vain
represent
,
that
he
could
not
with
safety
lie
to
,
or
anchor
upon
a
lee
-
shore
;
our
hero
have
consult
Pipes
,
answer
,
that
he
have
hire
his
vessel
to
transport
him
to
Calais
,
and
that
he
would
oblige
him
to
perform
what
he
have
undertake
.
    
<EOS>
the
skipper
,
very
much
mortify
at
this
peremptory
reply
,
which
be
not
over
and
above
agreeable
to
Mr
Jolter
,
dismiss
the
boat
,
notwithstanding
the
sollicitation
and
condescension
of
the
waterman
,
who
promise
to
submit
to
the
generosity
of
their
employer
;
and
run
a
little
farther
in
-
shore
,
come
to
an
anchor
,
and
wait
till
there
be
water
enough
to
float
them
over
the
bar
.
<EOS>
then
they
stand
in
to
the
harbour
,
and
our
gentleman
,
with
his
attendant
and
baggage
,
be
land
on
the
pier
by
the
sailor
,
whom
he
liberally
reward
for
their
trouble
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
ply
by
a
great
number
of
porter
,
who
,
like
so
many
hungry
wolf
,
lay
hold
on
his
luggage
,
and
begin
to
carry
it
off
piece

,
without
his

or

<EOS>
incense
at
this
officious
insolence
,
he
command
them
to
desist
,
with
many
oath
and
opprobrious
term
that
his
anger
suggest
;
and
perceive
that
one
of
them
do
not
seem
to
pay
any
regard
to
what
he
say
,
but
march
off
with
his
burthen
,
he
snatch
a
cudgel
out
of
his
lacquey
's
hand
,
and
overtake
the
fellow
in
a
twinkling
,
bring
him
to
the
ground
with
one
blow
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
instantly
surround
by
the
whole
congregration
of
this
canaille
,
who
resent
the
injury
which
their
brother
have
sustain
,
and
would
have
take
immediate
satisfaction
of
the
aggressor
,
have
not
pipe
,
see
his
master
involve
,
bring
the
whole
crew
to
his
assistance
,
and
exert
himself
so
manfully
,
that
the
enemy
be
oblige
to
retreat
with
many
mark
of
defeat
,
and
menace
of
interesting
the
commandant
in
their
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
know
and
dread
the
power
of
the
french
governor
,
begin
to
shake
with
apprehension
,
when
he
hear
their
repeat
threat
;
but
they
durst
not
apply
to
this
magistrate
,
who
,
upon
a
fair
representation
of
the
case
,
would
have
punish
them
severely
for
their
rapacious
and
insolent
behaviour
;
and
Peregrine
,
without
farth
molestation
,
avail
himself
of
his
own
attendant
,
who
shoulder
his
baggage
,
and
follow
him
to
the
gate
,
where
they
be
stopt
by
the
centinel
,
until
their
name
should
be
register
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
who
have
undergo
this
examination
before
,
resolve
to
profit
by
his
experience
,
and
cunningly
represent
his
pupil
as
a
young
english
lord
.
<EOS>
this
intimation
,
support
by
the
appearance
of
his
equipage
,
be
no
sooner
communicate
to
the
officer
,
than
he
turn
out
the
guard
,
and
order
his
soldier
to
rest
upon
their
arm
,
while
his
lordship
pass
in
great
state
to
the
Lion
d

Argent
,
where
he
take
up
his
lodging
for
the
night
,
resolve
to
set
out
for
Paris
next
morning
in
a
post

<EOS>
the
governor
triumph
greatly
in
this
piece
of
complaisance
and
respect
with
which
they
have
be
honour
,
and
resume
his
beloved
topic
of
discourse
,
in
applaud
the
method
and
subordination
of
the
french
government
,
which
be
better
calculate
for
maintain
order
,
and
protect
the
people
,
than
any
constitution
upon
earth
;
and
of
their
courteous
attention
to
stranger
,
there
need
no
other
proof
than
the
compliment
which
have
be
pay
to
them
,
together
with
the
governor
's
connivance
at
Peregrine
's
employ
his
own
servant
in
carry
the
baggage
to
the
inn
,
contrary
to
the
privilege
of
the
inhabitant
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
expatiate
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
self
-
indulgence
on
this
subject
,
the
valet
de
chambre
come
into
the
room
,
interrupt
his
harangue
,
by
tell
his
master
,
that
their
trunk
and
portmanteaus
must
be
carry
to
the
custom
-
house
,
in
order
to
be
search
,
and
seal
with
lead
,
which
must
remain
untouched
until
their
arrival
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
make
no
objection
to
this
practice
,
which
be
in
itself
reasonable
enough
;
but
when
he
understand
that
the
gate
be
besiege
by
another
multitude
of
porter
,
who
insist
upon
their
right
of
carry
the
good
,
and
also
of
fix
their
own
price
,
he
absolutely
refuse
to
comply
with
their
demand
;
and
chastise
some
of
the
most
clamorous
among
them
with
his
foot
,
tell
them
,
that
if
their
custom
-
house
officer
have
a
mind
to
examine
his
baggage
,
they
may
come
to
the
inn
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
valet
de
chambre
be
abash
at
this
boldness
of
his
master
's
behaviour
,
which
the
lacquey
,
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
observed
be
bien
a
l'Angloise
;
while
the
governor
represent
it
as
an
indignity
to
the
whole
nation
,
and
endeavour
to
persuade
his
pupil
to
comply
with
the
custom
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
but
Peregrine
's
natural
haughtiness
of
disposition
hinder
him
from
give
ear
to
Jolter
's
wholesome
advice
;
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
perceive
a
file
of
musqueteer
march
up
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
at
sight
of
this
detachment
the
tutor
tremble
,
the
valet
grow
pale
,
and
the
lacquey
cross
himself
;
but
our
hero
,
without
exhibit
any
other
symptom
than
those
of
indignation
,
meet
them
on
the
threshold
,
and
with
a
ferocious
air
demand
their
business
.
<EOS>
the
corporal
who
command
the
file
answer
with
great
deliberation
,
that
he
have
order
to
convey
his
baggage
to
the
custom
-
house
;
and
see
the
trunk
stand
in
the
entry
,
place
his
man
between
them
and
the
owner
,
while
the
porter
that
follow
,
take
them
up
,
and
proceed
to
the
Douane
without
opposition
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
be
not
mad
enough
to
dispute
the
authority
of
this
message
;
but
,
in
order
to
gall
,
and
specify
his
contempt
for
those
who
bring
it
,
he
call
aloud
to
his
valet
,
desire
him
,
in
French
,
to
accompany
his
thing
,
and
see
that
none
of
his
linen
and
effect
should
be
steal
by
the
searcher
.
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
mortify
at
this
satirical
insinuation
,
dart
a
look
of
resentment
at
the
author
,
as
if
he
have
be
interested
for
the
glory
of
his
nation
;
and
tell
him
,
that
he
could
perceive
he
be
a
stranger
in
France
,
or
else
he
would
have
save
himself
the
trouble
of
such
a
needless
precaution
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
expression
have
no
sooner
escape
our
young
gentleman
,
than
he
be
ashamed
of
his
own
petulance
;
for
nothing
be
farth
from
his
principle
than
the
least
encouragement
of
ungenerous
suspicion

<EOS>
He
make
a
fruitless
attempt
in
gallantry

depart
for

he
spend
the

with

.
   
<EOS>

he
inquire

satisfactory

of

the

he
pretend
to
be
deeply
verse
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
all
his
caution
and
skill
,
he
have
lately
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
attraction
of
an
oyster
-
wench
,
who
have
find
mean
to
decoy
him
into
the
band
of
wedlock
;
and
,
in
order
to
evade
the
compliment
and
congratulation
of
his
friend
and
acquaintance
,
he
have
come
so
far
on
a
tour
to
Paris
,
where
he
intend
to
initiate
his
spouse
in
the
beau
-
monde
;
though
in
the
mean
time
he
choose
to
live
upon
the
reserve
,
because
her
natural
talent
have
as
yet
receive
but
little
cultivation
;
and
he
have
not
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
her
virtue
and
discretion
,
which
,
it
seem
,
have
like
to
have
yield
to
the
address
of
an
officer
at
Canterbury
,
who
have
make
shift
to
insinuate
himself
into
her
acquaintance
and
favour
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
curiosity
be
inflame
by
this
information
,
he
lounge
about
the
yard
,
in
hope
of
see
the
Dulcinea
who
have
captivate
the
old
batchelor
,
and
at
length
observe
her
at
a
window
,
take
the
liberty
of
bow
to
her
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
She
return
the
compliment
with
a
curt'sie
,
and
appear
so
decent
in
her
dress
and
manner
,
that
unless
he
have
be
previously
inform
of
her
former
life
and
conversation
,
he
never
would
have
dreamt
that
her
education
be
different
from
that
of
other
lady
of
fashion
;
so
easy
it
be
to
acquire
that
external
deportment
on
which
people
of
condition
value
themselves
so
much
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
Mr
Pickle
pretend
to
distinguish
a
certain
vulgar
audacity
in
her
countenance
,
which
in
a
lady
of
birth
and
fortune
would
have
pass
for
an
agreeable
vivacity
that
enliven
the
aspect
,
and
give
a
poignancy
to
every
feature
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
possess
a
pair
of
fine
eye
and
a
clear
complexion
,
overspread
with
the
glow
of
health
,
which
never
fail
of
recommend
the
owner
,
he
could
not
help
gaze
at
her
with
desire
,
and
form
the
design
of
make
a
conquest
of
her
heart
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
send
his
compliment
to
her
husband
,
whose
name
be
Hornbeck
,
with
an
intimation
,
that
he
propose
to
set
out
next
day
for
Paris
,
and
as
he
understand
that
he
be
resolve
upon
the
same
journey
,
he
should
be
extremely
glad
of
his
company
on
the
road
,
if
he
be
not
better
engage
.
<EOS>
Hornbeck
,
who
in
all
probability
do
not
chuse
to
accommodate
his
wife
with
a
squire
of
our
hero
's
appearance
,
send
a
civil
answer
to
his
message
,
profess
infinite
mortification
at
his
be
unable
to
embrace
the
favour
of
his
kind
offer
,
by
reason
of
the
indisposition
of
his
wife
,
who
,
he
be
afraid
,
would
not
be
in
a
condition
for
some
day
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
travel
.
<EOS>
this
rebuff
,
which
Peregrine
ascribe
to
the
husband
's
jealousy
,
stifle
his
project
in
embrio
;
he
order
his
french
servant
to
take
a
place
for
himself
in
the
Diligence
,
where
all
his
luggage
be
stow
,
except
a
small
trunk
with
some
linen
and
other
necessary
that
be
fix
upon
the
post
-
chaise
which
they
hire
of
the
landlord
;
and
early
next
morning
he
and
Mr
Jolter
depart
from
Calais
,
attend
by
his
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
They
proceed
without
any
accident
as
far
as
Boulogne
,
where
they
breakfast
and
visit
old
father
Graham
,
a
scottish
gentleman
of
the
governor
's
acquaintance
,
who
have
live
as
a
capuchin
in
that
place
for
the
space
of
threescore
year
,
and
during
that
period
conform
to
all
the
austerity
of
the
order
,
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
;
be
equally
remarkable
for
the
frankness
of
his
conversation
,
the
humanity
of
his
disposition
,
and
the
simplicity
of
his
manner
.
    
<EOS>
from
Boulogne
they
take
their
departure
about
noon
,
and
as
they
propose
to
sleep
that
night
at
Abbe
Ville
,
command
the
postilion
to
drive
with
extraordinary
speed
;
and
perhaps
it
be
well
for
his
cattle
that
the
axle
-
tree
give
way
,
and
the
chaise
of
course
overturn
before
they
have
travel
one
third
part
of
the
stage
.
    
<EOS>
this
accident
compel
them
to
return
to
the
place
from
whence
they
have
set
out
,
and
as
they
could
not
procure
another
convenience
,
they
find
themselves
under
the
necessity
of
stay
till
their
chaise
could
be
refit
.
<EOS>
understand
that
this
operation
would
detain
them
a
whole
day
,
our
young
gentleman
have
recourse
to
his
patience
,
and
demand
to
know
what
they
could
have
for
dinner
;
the
garon
,
or
waiter
thus
question
,
vanish
in
a
moment
,
and
immediately
they
be
surprize
with
the
appearance
of
a
strange
figure
,
which
from
the
extravagance
of
its
dress
and
gesticulation
,
Peregrine
mistake
for
a
madman
of
the
growth
of
France
.
<EOS>
this
phantome
(
which
by
the
bye
,
happen
to
be
no
other
than
the
cook
)
be
a
tall
,
long
-
legged
,
meagre
,
swarthy
fellow
,
that
stoop
very
much
;
his
cheekbone
be
remarkably
raise
,
his
nose
bent
into
the
shape
and
size
of
a
powder
-
horn
,
and
the
socket
of
his
eye
as
raw
round
the
edge
,
as
if
the
skin
have
be
pare
off
;
on
his
head
he
wear
an
handkerchief
which
have
once
be
white
,
and
now
serve
to
cover
the
upper
part
of
a
black
periwig
,
to
which
be
attach
a
bag
,
at
least
a
foot
square
,
with
a
solitaire
and
rise
that
stick
up
on
each
side
to
his
ear
;
so
that
he
look
like
a
criminal
in
the
pillory
;
his
back
be
accommodate
with
a
linnen
waistcoat
,
his
hand
adorn
with
long
ruffle
of
the
same
piece
,
his
middle
be
gird
by
an
apron
tuck
up
,
that
it
may
not
conceal
his
white
silk
stocking
roll
;
and
at
his
entrance
he
brandish
a
bloody
weapon
full
three
foot
in
length
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
when
he
first
see
him
approach
in
this
menacing
attitude
,
put
himself
upon
his
guard
,
but
be
inform
of
his
quality
,
peruse
his
list
,
and
have
bespeak
three
or
four
thing
for
dinner
,
walk
out
with
Mr
Jolter
to
view
both
town
,
which
they
have
not
leisure
to
consider
minutely
before
.
<EOS>
in
their
return
from
the
harbour
they
meet
with
four
or
five
gentleman
,
all
of
whom
seem
to
look
with
an
air
of
dejection
,
and
perceive
our
hero
and
his
governor
to
be
English
by
their
dress
,
bow
with
great
respect
as
they
pass
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
be
naturally
compassionate
,
feel
an
emotion
of
sympathy
;
and
see
a
person
,
who
by
his
habit
he
judge
to
be
one
of
their
servant
,
accost
him
in
English
,
and
ask
who
the
gentleman
be
.
<EOS>
the
lacquey
give
him
to
understand
that
they
be
his
own
countryman
,
exile
from
their
native
home
,
in
consequence
of
their
adherence
to
an
unfortunate
and
ruin
cause
;
and
that
they
be
go
to
the
sea
-
side
,
accord
to
their
daily
practice
,
in
order
to
indulge
their
longing
eye
,
with
a
prospect
of
the
white
cliff
of
Albion
,
which
they
must
never
more
approach
.
    
<EOS>
though
our
young
gentleman
differ
widely
from
them
in
point
of
political
principle
,
he
be
not
one
of
those
enthusiast
who
look
upon
every
schism
from
the
establish
article
of
faith
,
as
damnable
,
and
exclude
the
sceptick
from
every
benefit
of
humanity
and
christian
forgiveness
:
he
could
easily
comprehend
how
a
man
of
the
most
unblemished
moral
may
,
by
the
prejudice
of
education
,
or
indispensible
attachment
,
be
ingage
in
such
a
blame
-
worthy
and
pernicious
undertaking
;
and
think
that
they
have
already
suffer
severely
for
their
imprudence
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
affect
with
the
account
of
their
diurnal
pilgrimage
to
the
sea
-
side
,
which
he
consider
as
a
pathetic
proof
of
their
affliction
,
and
invest
Mr
Jolter
with
the
agreeable
office
of
go
to
them
with
a
compliment
in
his
name
,
and
beg
the
honour
of
drink
a
glass
with
them
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
accept
the
proposal
with
great
satisfaction
and
respectful
acknowledgement
,
and
in
the
afternoon
wait
upon
the
kind
inviter
,
who
treat
them
with
coffee
,
and
would
have
detain
them
to
supper
;
but
they
intreate
the
favour
of
his
company
at
the
house
which
they
frequent
,
so
earnestly
,
that
he
yield
to
their
solicitation
,
and
with
his
governor
be
conduct
by
them
to
the
place
,
where
they
have
provide
an
elegant
repast
,
and
regale
them
with
some
of
the
good
claret
in
France
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
them
to
perceive
that
their
principal
guest
be
no
favourer
of
their
state
maxim
,
and
therefore
they
industriously
avoid
every
subject
of
conversation
which
could
give
the
least
offence
;
not
but
that
they
lament
their
own
situation
,
which
cut
them
off
from
all
their
dear
connexion
,
and
doom
them
to
perpetual
banishment
from
their
family
and
friend
:
but
they
do
not
even
by
the
most
distant
hint
,
impeach
the
justice
of
that
sentence
by
which
they
be
condemn
;
although
one
among
them
,
who
seem
to
be
about
the
age
of
thirty
,
weep
bitterly
over
his
misfortune
,
which
have
involve
a
beloved
wife
and
three
child
in
misery
and
distress
;
and
in
the
impatience
of
his
grief
,
curse
his
own
fate
with
frantic
imprecation
.
    
<EOS>
His
companion
,
with
a
view
of
beguile
his
sorrow
,
and
manifest
their
own
hospitality
at
the
same
time
,
change
the
topic
of
discourse
,
and
circulate
the
bumper
with
great
assiduity
;
so
that
all
their
care
be
overwhelmed
and
forgotten
,
several
drink
french
catch
be
sing
,
and
mirth
and
good
fellowship
prevail
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
elevation
,
which
commonly
unlock
the
most
hidden
sentiment
,
and
dispel
every
consideration
of
caution
and
constraint

one
of
the
entertainer
be
more
intoxicated
than
his

propose
a
toast
,
to
which
Peregrine
with
some
warmth
except

as
an
unmannerly
insult

<EOS>
the
other
maintain
his
proposition
with
indecent
heat
,
and
the
dispute
begin
to
grow
very
serious
,
the
company
interpose
,
and
give
judgment
against
their
friend
,
who
be
so
keenly
reproach
and
rebuke
for
his
impolite
behaviour
,
by
the
gentleman
whose
sensibility
hath
be
mention
,
that
he
retire
in
high
dudgeon
,
threaten
to
relinquish
their
society

and
brand
them
with
the
appellation
of
apostate
from
the
common
cause

mortify
at
the

those

their
apology

their

they
besought

upon
the
recovery
of
his

wait
upon

in

ask
pardon

the
umbrage
he
have
give

<EOS>
Pickle
be
satisfied
with
their
remonstrance
,
resume
his
good
humour
,
and
the
night
be
pretty
far
advanced
,
resist
all
their
importunity
with
which
he
be
intreate
to
see
another
bottle
go
round
,
and
be
escort
to
his

next

about
eight
o'clock

this
extraordinary
visit

his

He
who

make
an
apology
for

Mr

,
tell
him
that
his
friend
there
present
have
be
with
him
early
that
morning
,
and
propose
the
alternative
of
either
fighting
with
him
immediately
,
or
come
to
beg
pardon
for
his
unmannerly
deportment
over
night
;
that
though
he
have
courage
enough
to
face
any
man
in
the
field
in
a
righteous
cause

he
be
not
so
brutal
as
to
disobey
the

reflection

in

and
not
out

beg
his
forgiveness
accordingly

Our

this
acknowledgment
very
graciously

<EOS>
during
this
day
's
expedition
,
Mr
Jolter
take
an
opportunity
of
impart
to
his
pupil
the
remark
he
have
make
upon
the
industry
of
the
French
,
as
an
undeniable
proof
of
which
he
bad
him
cast
his
eye
around
,
and
observe
with
what
care
every
spot
of
ground
be
cultivate
;
and
from
the
fertility
of
that
province
,
which
be
reckon
the
poor
in
France
,
conceive
the
wealth
and
affluence
of
the
nation
in
general
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
amazed
as
well
as
disgust
at
this
infatuation
,
answer
that
what
he
ascribe
to
industry
,
be
the
effect
of
meer
wretchedness
;
the
miserable
peasant
be
oblige
to
plough
up
every
inch
of
ground
to
satisfy
their
oppressive
landlord
,
while
they
themselves
and
their
cattle
look
like
so
many
image
of
famine
;
that
their
extreme
poverty
be
evident
from
the
face
of
the
country
,
on
which
there
be
not
one
inclosure
to
be
see
,
or
any
other
object
,
except
scanty
crop
of
barley
and
oats
,
which
could
never
reward
the
toil
of
the
husbandman
;
that
their
habitation
be
no
well
than
paultry
hut
;
that
in
twenty
mile
of
extent
,
not
one
gentleman
's
house
appear
;
that
nothing
be
more
abject
and
forlorn
than
the
attire
of
their
country
people
;
and
lastly
,
that
the
equipage
of
their
travel
chaise
be
infinitely
inferior
to
that
of
a
dungcart
in
England
;
and
that
the
postilion
who
then
drive
their
carriage
,
have
neither
stocking

his
leg
,
nor
a
shirt
to
his
back

find
his
charge
so
intractable
,
resolve
to
leave
him
in
the
mist
of
his
own
ignorance
and
prejudice
,
and
reserve
his
observation
for
those
who
would
pay
more
deference
to
his
opinion
;
and
indeed
this
resolution
he
have
often
make
,
and
as
often
break
,
in
the
transport
of
his
zeal
,
that
frequently
hurry
him
out
of
the
plan
of
conduct
which
in
his
cooler
moment
he
have
lay
down
.
<EOS>
They
halt
for
a
refreshment
at
Montreuil
,
and
about
eight
in
the
evening
arrive
at
a
village
call
Bernay
,
where
while
they
wait
for
fresh
horse
,
they
be
inform
by
the
landlord
,
that
the
gate
of
Abbe
Ville
be
shut
every
night
punctually
at
nine
o'clock
;
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
get
admittance
;
and
that
there
be
not
another
place
of
entertainment
on
the
road
where
they
could
pass
the
night
;
he
therefore
,
as
a
friend
,
advise
them
to
stay
at
his
house
,
where
they
would
find
the
good
of
accommodation
,
and
proceed
upon
their
journey
by
time
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
though
he
have
travel
on
that
road
before
,
could
not
recollect
whether
or
not
mine
host
speak
truth
;
but
his
remonstrance
be
very
plausible
,
our
hero
determine
to
follow
his
advice
,
and
be
conduct
into
an
apartment
,
ask
what
they
could
have
for
supper
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
mention
every
thing
that
be
eatable
in
the
house
,
and
the
whole
be
ingrosse
for
the
use
of
him
and
his
attendant
,
he
amuse
himself
till
such
time
as
it
could
be
dress
,
in
converse
with
the
daughter
,
who
be
a
sprightly
damsel
about
the
age
of
seventeen
;
and
in
stroll
about
the
house
,
which
stand
in
a
very
rural
situation
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
loiter
away
the
time
that
hang
heavy
on
his
hand
,
another
chaise
arrive
at
the
inn
,
and
upon
inquiry
he
find
that
the
new
comer
be
Mr
Hornbeck
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
,
conscious
of
his
inability
to
entertain
this
second
company
,
come
and
beg
with
great
humiliation
that
Mr
Pickle
would
spare
them
some
part
of
the
victual
he
have
bespeak
;
but
he
refuse
to
part
with
so
much
as
the
wing
of
a
partridge
,
though
at
the
same
time
he
send
his
compliment
to
the
stranger
,
and
give
them
to
understand
how
ill
the
house
be
provide
for
their
reception
,
invite
them
to
partake
of
his
supper
.
<EOS>
Mr
Hornbeck
,
who
be
not
deficient
in
point
of
politeness
,
and
extremely
well
disposed
for
a
relishing
meal
,
which
he
have
reason
to
expect
from
the
savoury
steam
that
issue
from
the
kitchen
,
could
not
resist
this
second
instance
of
our
young
gentleman
's
civility
,
which
he
acknowledge
by
a
message
,
import
that
he
and
his
wife
would
do
themselves
the
pleasure
of
profit
by
his
courteous
offer
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
cheek
glow
when
he
find
himself
on
the
eve
of
be
acquaint
with
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
of
whose
heart
he
have
already
make
a
conquest
in
imagination
;
and
he
forthwith
set
his
invention
at
work
,
to
contrive
some
mean
of
defeat
her
husband
's
vigilance
.
    
<EOS>
when
supper
be
ready
,
he
in
person
give
notice
to
his
guest
,
and
lead
the
lady
into
his
apartment
,
seat
her
in
an
elbow
chair
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
squeeze
her
hand
and
dart
a
most
insidious
glance
at
the
same
time
.
    
<EOS>
this
abrupt
behaviour
he
practise
on
the
presumption
,
that
a
lady
of
her
breeding
be
not
to
be
address
with
the
tedious
form
that
must
be
observe
in
one
's
advance
to
a
person
of
birth
and
genteel
education
;
and
in
all
probability
his
calculation
be
just
,
for
Mrs
Hornbeck
give
no
sign
of
discontent
at
this
sort
of
treatment
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
seem
to
consider
it
as
a
proof
of
the
young
gentleman
's
regard
;
and
though
she
do
not
venture
to
open
her
mouth
three
time
during
the
whole
repast
,
she
shew
herself
particularly
well
satisfied
with
her
entertainer
,
by
sundry
sly
and
significant
look
,
while
her
husband
's
eye
be
direct
another
way
,
and
diver
loud
peal
of
laughter
,
signify
her
approbation
of
the
sally
which
he
utter
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
Her
spouse
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
at
the
frank
demeanour
of
his
yokefellow
,
whom
he
endeavour
to
check
in
her
vivacity
,
by
assume
a
severity
of
aspect
;
but
whether
she
obey
the
dictate
of
her
own
disposition
,
which
,
perhaps
,
be
merry
and
unreserved
,
or
want
to
punish
Mr
Hornbeck
for
his
jealousy
of
temper
;
certain
it
be
,
her
gaiety
increase
to
such
a
degree
,
that
her
husband
be
grievously
alarm
and
incense
at
her
conduct
,
and
resolve
to
make
her
sensible
of
his
displeasure
,
by
tread
in
secret
upon
her
toe
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
so
disconcert
by
his
indignation
,
that
he
mistake
his
mark
,
and
apply
the
sharp
heel
of
his
shoe
to
the
side
of
Mr
Jolter
's
foot
,
comprehend
his
little
toe
that
be
stud
with
an
angry
corn
,
which
he
invade
with
such
a
sudden
jerk
,
that
the
governor
,
unable
to
endure
the
torture
in
silence
,
start
up
,
and
dance
on
the
floor
,
roar
hideously
with
repeat
bellowing
,
to
the
unspeakable
enjoyment
of
Peregrine
and
the
lady
,
who
laugh
themselves
almost
into
convulsion
at
the
joke
.
    
<EOS>
Hornbeck
,
confound
at
the
mistake
he
have
commit
,
begged
pardon
of
the
injure
tutor
with
great
contrition
,
protest
that
the
blow
he
have
so
unfortunately
receive
,
be
intend
for
an
ugly
cur
,
which
he
think
have
post
himself
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
lucky
for
him
that
there
be
actually
a
dog
in
the
room
,
to
justify
this
excuse
,
which
Jolter
admit
with
the
tear
run
over
his
cheek
,
and
the
oeconomy
of
the
table
be
re
-
compose
.
    
<EOS>
as
soon
,
however
,
as
the
stranger
could
with
decency
withdraw
,
this
suspicious
husband
take
his
leave
of
the
youth
,
on
pretence
of
be
fatigue
with
his
journey
,
after
have
,
by
way
of
compliment
,
propose
that
they
should
travel
together
next
day
;
and
Peregrine
hand
the
lady
to
her
chamber
,
where
he
wish
her
good
night
with
another
warm
squeeze
,
which
she
return
.
<EOS>
this
favourable
hint
make
his
heart
bind
with
a
transport
of
joy
;
he
lie
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
declare
himself
,
and
see
the
husband
go
down
into
the
yard
with
a
candle
,
he
glide
softly
into
his
apartment
,
and
find
her
almost
undressed
.
<EOS>
impel
by
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
which
be
still
more
inflame
by
her
present
luscious
appearance
,
and
encourage
by
the
approbation
she
have
already
express
,
he
run
towards
her
with
eagerness
,
cry
,
"
zounds
!
<EOS>
madam
,
your
charm
be
irresistible
!
"
<EOS>
and
without
further
ceremony
would
have
clasp
her
in
his
arm
,
have
not
she
beg
him
for
the
love
of
God
to
retire
,
for
should
<EOS>
Mr
Hornbeck
return
and
find
him
there
<EOS>
,
she
would
be
undo
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
blind
by
his
passion
but
that
he
see
the
reasonableness
of
her
fear
,
and
as
he
could
not
pretend
to
crown
his
wish
at
that
interview
,
he
avow
himself
her
lover
,
assure
her
that
he
would
exhaust
his
whole
invention
in
find
a
proper
opportunity
for
throw
himself
at
her
foot
;
and
in
the
mean
time
he
ravish
sundry
small
favour
,
which
she
in
the
hurry
of
her
fright
could
not
with
-
hold
from
his
impudence
of
address
.
<EOS>
have
thus
happily
settle
the
preliminary
,
he
withdraw
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
spend
the
whole
night
in
contrive
stratagem
to
elude
the
jealous
caution
of
his

where

by
a
life
of
irregularity
<EOS>
,
he
find
himself
so
fatigued
with
this
day
's
journey
,
which
amount
to
upward
of
an
hundred
mile
,
that
when
he
sit
down
at
table
,
he
could
scarce
sit
upright
;
and
in
less
than
three
minute
begin
to
nod
in
his
chair

<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
have
foresee
and
provide
for
this
occasion
,
advise
him
to
exhilarate
his
spirit
with
a
glass
of

to
the
instruction
he
have

Burgundy
with
thirty
drop
of
laudanum

which

in
one
glass

necessary
to
convey
him
to
his
own
chamber
,
where
his
footman
undress
and
put
him
to
bed

<EOS>
nor
be
Jolter
(
naturally
of
a
sluggish
disposition
)
able
to
resist
his
propensity
to
sleep
,
without
suffer
diver
dreadful
yawn
,
which
encourage
his
pupil
to
administer
the
same
dose
to
him
,
which
have
operate
so
successfully
upon
the
other
Argus
.
<EOS>
this
cordial
have
not
such
a
gentle
effect
upon
the
rugged
organ
of
Jolter
as
upon
the
more
delicate
nerve
of
Hornbeck
;
but
discover
itself
in
certain
involuntary
starting
,
and
convulsive
motion
in
the
muscle
of
his
face
;
and
when
his
nature
at
length
yield
to
the
power
of
this
medicine
,
he
sound
the
trumpet
so
loud
through
his
nostril
,
that
our
adventurer
be
afraid
the
noise
would
awake
his
other
patient
,
and
consequently
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
his
aim

<EOS>
the
governor
be
therefore
commit
to

care
of
Pipes

who
lug
him
into
the
next
room

into
his
nest
,
while

remain
at
full
liberty
to

their
mutual
passion

<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
the
impatience
of
his
inclination
,
would
have
finish
the
fate
of

his
inamorata

to
her
door
,
which

for
his
admission
in
the
dark
<EOS>
,
he

in

embrace
of

and
the
lady
in
a
loose
gown
,
ready
to
seal
his
happiness

<EOS>
He
seize

by
the
forelock

his

it
to

with
a
most
expressive
countenance

"
Madam

who

admirable

look
earnestly
at
the

with
incredible
serenity

countenance

affirm
that
the

must
belong
to

none

<EOS>
Peregrine

this

Hornbeck
by
the

"
gadszook

<EOS>
say
he

what

Pshaw

because
you

"
    
<EOS>
the
poor
husband
be
so
confound
at
the
effrontery
of
his
wife
,
and
this
cavalier
declaration
of
the
young
man
,
that
his
faith
begin
to
waver
;
he
distrust
his
own
conscious
diffidence
of
temper
,
which
that
he
may
not
expose
,
he
express
no
doubt
of
Peregrine

veracity

but
ask
pardon
for
the
mistake
he
have
commit
,
retire
with
a
grim
look
,
not
yet
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
his
ingenious
helpmate

but
on
the
contrary
determine
to
inquire
more
minutely
into
the
circumstance
of
this
adventure
;
which
turn
out
so
little
to
his
satisfaction

that
he
order
his
servant
to
get
every
thing
ready
for
his
departure
by
break
of

with

of

<EOS>
Peregrine
be
a
little
chagrined
,
when
he
understand
that
he
be
so
suddenly
deprive
of
this
almost
untasted
morsel
;
and
Jolter
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
their
abrupt
and
uncivil
disappearance
,
which
after
many
profound
conjecture
,
he
account
for
,
by
suppose
that
Hornbeck
be
some
sharp
who
have
run
away
with
an
heiress

whom
he
find
it
necessary
to
conceal
from
the
inquiry

the

well
assure
of
the
true
motive

allow
his

to
enjoy
the

himself
with
the
hope
of
see
his

They

our

write

letter
to
his

Gauntlet

to

repeat
all
his
former

of
constancy

the
next
care
that
ingrosse
him
be
that
of
bespeak
several
suit
of
cloath
suitable
to
the
french
mode
,
and
in
the
mean
time
he
never
appear
abroad
,
except
in
the
english
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
soon
become
acquaint
with
some
of
his
own
countryman
,
who
be
at
Paris
on
the
same
footing
with
himself
.
<EOS>
the
third
evening
after
his
journey
,
he
be
engage
in
a
party
of
those
young
spark
,
at
the
house
of
a
note
Traiteur
,
whose
wife
be
remarkably
handsome
,
and
otherwise
extremely
well
qualified
for
alluring
customer
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
to
this
lady
our
young
gentleman
be
introduce
as
a
stranger
fresh
from
England
;
and
he
be
charm
with
her
personal
accomplishment
,
as
well
as
with
the
freedom
and
gaiety
of
her
conversation
:
have
sit
with
them
about
an
hour
,
she
get
up
in
order
to
retire
,
but
be
earnestly
intreate
to
favour
them
with
her
company
at
supper
,
she
promise
to
gratify
their
desire
,
and
tell
them
,
without
any
ceremony
or
circumlocution
,
that
she
would
only
step
into
the
next
room
to
make
water
,
and
return
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
this
frank
declaration
sound
so
oddly
in
the
ear
of
Peregrine
,
that
he
conclude
he
may
,
without
offence
,
take
any
sort
of
liberty
with
a
woman
who
could
thus
behave
so
wide
of
decency
and
decorum
;
and
on
this
supposition
,
he
follow
her
cavalierly
to
her
closet
,
where
he
address
her
in
such
palpable
term
,
as
he
think
her
character
intitle
him
to
use
.
    
<EOS>
She
be
surprised
at
his
confidence
,
which
she
begin
to
rally
as
a
speciman
of
english
plain
dealing
,
while
she
very
deliberately
execute
in
his
presence
the
intent
of
her
withdrawing
;
and
he
still
more
encouraged
by
this
deportment
,
urge
his
suit
with
such
impetuosity
,
that
the
fair
Burgeoise
be
compel
to
cry
aloud
in
defence
of
her
own
virtue
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
run
immediately
to
her
assistance
,
and
find
her
in
a
very
alarming
situation
,
fly
upon
her
ravisher
with
such
fury
,
that
he
be
fain
to
quit
his
prey
,
and
turn
against
the
exasperate
Traiteur
,
whom
he
punish
without
mercy
for
his
impudent
intrusion
.
<EOS>
the
lady
see
her
yokefellow
treat
with
so
little
respect
,
espouse
his
cause
,
and
fix
her
nail
in
his
antagonist
's
face
,
scarify
all
one
side
of
his
nose
.
<EOS>
the
noise
of
this
encounter
bring
all
the
servant
of
the
house
to
the
rescue
of
their
master
,
and
Peregrine
's
company
arrive
at
the
same
time
,
a
general
battle
ensue
,
in
which
the
French
be
totally
route

the
wife
be
insult

and
the

<EOS>
the

enrage
at
the
indignity
which
have
be
offer
to
him
and
his
family
,
go
out
into
the
street

and
implore
the
protection
of
the
guet
or
city

guard
,
which
have
hear
his
complaint
,
fix
their
bayonet
and
surround
the
door
,
to
the
number
of
twelve
or
fourteen
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
flush
with
their
success

and
consider
the
soldier
as
so
many
London
watchman
,
whom
they
have
often
put
to
flight
,
draw
their
sword
,
and
sally
out

with

<EOS>
whether
the

inexperience

intoxicate
with
liquor

they
open
to
right
and
leave

and
give

without

<EOS>
this
complaisance
,
which
be
the
effect
of
compassion
,
be
misinterpret
by
the
english

he
out
of

wantonness
attempt

fail

receive
a

with
the

that
make

this
audacious
application

the

after
an
obstinate

in

the
circumstance
of
the
quarrel

in
consideration
of
their
youth
and
national
ferocity
,
for
which
the
French
make
large
allowance
,
set
them
all
at
liberty
,
after
have
gently
rebuke
them
for
the
irregularity
and
insolence
of
their
conduct
:
so
that
all
our

acquire
by
his
gallantry
and
courage
,
be
a
number
of
scandalous
mark
upon
his
visage
,
that
confine
him
a

week
to
his
chamber

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
conceal
this
disaster
from
Mr
Jolter
,
who
have
get
intelligence
of
the
particular
,
do
not
fail
to
remonstrate
against
the
rashness
of
the
adventure
,
which
,
he
observe
,
must
have
be
fatal
to
them
,
have
their
enemy
be
other
than
Frenchmen
,
who
of
all
nation
under
the
sun
,
most
rigorously
observe
the
law
of
hospitality
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
governor
's
acquaintance
lie
chiefly
among
irish
and
english
priest
,
and
a
set
of
low
people
,
who
live
by
make
themselves
necessary
to
stranger
,
either
in
teach
the
french
language
,
or
execute
small
commission
with
which
they
be
intrust
,
he
be
not
the
most
proper
person
in
the
world
for
regulate
the
taste
of
a
young
gentleman
who
travel
for
improvement
,
in
expectation
of
make
a
figure
one
day
in
his
own
country
;
and
be
conscious
of
his
own
incapacity
,
he
content
himself
with
the
office
of
a
steward
,
and
keep
a
faithful
account
of
all
the
money
that
be
disburse
in
the
course
of
their
family
expence
:
not
but
that
he
be
acquaint
with
all
the
place
which
be
visit
by
stranger
on
their
first
arrival
at
Paris
;
and
know
to
a
liard
what
be
commonly
give
to
the
Swiss
of
each
remarkable
hotel
;
though
,
with
respect
to
the
curious
painting
and
statuary
that
every
where
abound
in
that
metropolis
,
he
be
more
ignorant
than
the
domestic
that
attend
for
a
livre
a
day
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mr
Jolter
could
give
a
very
good
account
of
the
stage
on
the
road
,
and
save
the
expence
of
Antonini
's
detail
of
the
curiosity
in
Paris
;
he
be
a
connoisseur
in
ordinary
,
from
twelve
to
five
and
thirty
livre
,
know
all
the
rate
of
a
Fiacre
and
Remise
,
could
dispute
with
a
Tailleur
or
Traiteur
upon
the
article
of
his
bill
,
and
scold
the
servant
in
tolerable
French
.
<EOS>
but
the
law
,
custom
and
genius
of
the
people
,
the
character
of
individual
,
and
scene
of
polished
life
,
be
subject
which
he
have
neither
opportunity
to
observe
,
inclination
to
consider
,
or
discernment
to
distinguish
.
<EOS>
all
his
maxim
be
the
suggestion
of
pedantry
and
prejudice
;
so
that
his
perception
be
obscure
,
his
judgment
bias
,
his
address
aukward
,
and
his
conversation
absurd
and
unentertaining
:
yet
such
as
I
have
represent
this
tutor
,
be
the
great
part
of
those
animal
who
lead
raw
boy
about
the
world

under
the
denomination

governor

<EOS>
Peregrine
,
therefore
,
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
extent
of
Mr
Jolter
's
ability
,
never
dreamt
of
consult
him
in
the
disposition
of
his
conduct
,
but
parcel
out
his
time
accord
to
the
dictate
of
his
own
reflection
,
and
the
information
and
direction
of
his
companion
,
who
have
live
longer
in
France
,
and
consequently
be
better
acquaint
with
the
pleasure
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
in
a
condition
to
appear
a
la
Franoise

he
hire
a
genteel
chariot
by

make
the
tour
of
the
Luxembourg
gallery

Palais

all
the

enjoy

seldom

appear
in
the
public
walk
,
in
hope
of
meet
with
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
or
some
adventure
suited
to
his
romantic
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
never
doubt
that
his
person
would
attract
the
notice
of
some
distinguished
inamorata
,
and
be
vain
enough
to
believe
that
few
female
heart
be
able
to
resist
the
artillery
of
his
accomplishment
,
if
once
he
have
an
opportunity
of
plant
it
to
advantage

<EOS>
He
present
himself
,
however
,
at
all
the
Spectacles
for
many
week
,
without
reap
the
fruit
of
his
expectation
;
and
begin
to
entertain
a
very
indifferent
idea
of
the
french
discernment
,
which
have
overlook
him
so
long
,
when
one
day
in
his
way

the
opera

his

be
stop
by
an
embarra

occasion
by
two
peasant

who
have
drive
their
cart
against
each
other

quarrel
,
and
go
to
loggerhead
on
the
spot

<EOS>
such
a
rencounter
be
so
uncommon
in
France
,
that
the
people
shut
up
their
shop
,
and
from
their
window
throw
cold
water
upon
the
combatant
,
with
a
view
of
put
an
end
to
the
battle
,
which
be
maintain
with
great
fury
and
very
little
skill

until
one
of
them
receive
an
accidental
fall
,
the
other
take
the
advantage
of
this
misfortune
,
and
fasten
upon
him
as
he
lie

begin
to
thump
the
pavement
with
his

<EOS>
Our

our
hero
think
proper
to
interpose
his
authority
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
the
common
people
stand
aghast
at
this
unprecedented
boldness
of
Pickle
,
who
understand
that
the
person
whose
servant
he
have
discipline
,
be
a
general
and
prince
of
the
blood
,
go
up
to
the
coach
,
and
ask
pardon
for
what
he
have
do
,
impute
his
own
behaviour
to
his
ignorance
of
the
other
's
quality
.
<EOS>
the
old
nobleman
accept
of
his
apology
with
great
politeness
,
thank
him
for
the
trouble
he
have
take
to
reform
the
manner
of
his
domestick
;
and
guess
from
our
youth
's
appearance
that
he
be
some
stranger
of
condition
,
very
courteously
invite
him
into
the
coach
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
be
both
bind
for
the
opera
.
<EOS>
Pickle
gladly
embrace
this
opportunity
of
become
acquaint
with
a
person
of
such
rank
,
and
order
his
own
chariot
to
follow
,
accompany
the
count
to
his
loge
,
where
he
converse
with
him
during
the
whole
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
He
soon
perceive
that
Peregrine
be
not
deficient
in
spirit
or
sense
,
and
seem
particularly
pleased
with
his
engage
manner
and
easy
deportment
,
qualification
for
which
the
english
nation
be
by
no
mean
remarkable
in
France
,
and
therefore
the
more
conspicuous
and
agreeable
in
the
character
of
our
hero
,
whom
the
nobleman
carry
home
that
same
evening
,
and
introduce
to
his
lady
,
and
several
person
of
fashion
who
sup
at
his
house
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
quite
captivate
by
their
affable
behaviour
and
the
vivacity
of
their
discourse
;
and
after
have
be
honour
with
particular
mark
of
consideration
,
take
his
leave
,
fully
determine
to
cultivate
such
a
valuable
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
His
vanity
suggest
,
that
now
the
time
be
come
when
he
should
profit
by
his
talent
among
the
fair
sex
,
on
whom
he
resolve
to
employ
his
utmost
art
and
address
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
assiduously
engage
in
all
party
to
which
he
have
access
,
by
mean
of
his
noble
friend
,
who
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
gratify
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
for
some
time
share
in
all
his
amusement
,
and
be
entertain
in
many
of
the
good
family
of
France
;
but
he
do
not
long
enjoy
that
elevation
of
hope
which
have
flatter
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
He
soon
perceive
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
the
honourable
connexion
he
have
make
,
without
engage
every
day
at
quadrille
,
or
in
other
word
,
lose
his
money
;
for
every
person
of
rank
,
whether
male
or
female
,
be
a
profess
gamester
,
who
know
and
practise
all
the
finesse
of
the
art
,
of
which
he
be
intirely
ignorant
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
begin
to
find
himself
a
meer
novice
in
french
gallantry
,
which
be
support
by
an
amazing
volubility
of
tongue
,
an
obsequious
and
incredible
attention
to
trifle
,
a
surprising
faculty
of
laugh
out
of
pure
complaisance
,
and
a
nothingness
of
conversation
,
which
he
could
never
attain
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
our
hero
,
who
among
his
own
countryman
would
have
pass
for
a
sprightly
entertaining
fellow
,
be
consider
in
the
brilliant
assembly
of
France
as
a
youth
of
a
very
phlegmatic
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
that
his
pride
be
mortify
at
his
own
want
of
importance
,
which
he
do
not
fail
to
ascribe
to
their
defect
in
point
of
judgment
and
taste
<EOS>
:
he
conceive
a
disgust
at
the
mercenary
conduct
,
as
well
as
the
shallow
intellect
of
the
lady
;
and
after
he
have
spend
some
month
,
and
a
round
sum
of
money
,
in
fruitless
attendance
and
address
,
he
fairly
quit
the
pursuit
,
and
console
himself
with
the
conversation
of
a
merry
Fille
de
joye
,
whose
good
grace
he
acquire
by
an
allowance
of
twenty
Louis
per
month
;
and
that
he
may
the
more
easily
afford
this
expence
,
dismiss
his
chariot
and
french
lacquey
at
the
same
time
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
enter
himself
in
a
note
academy
,
in
order
to
finish
his
exercise
,
and
contract
an
acquaintance
with
a
few
sensible
people
,
whom
he
distinguish
at
the
coffee
-
house
and
ordinary
to
which
he
resort
,
and
who
contribute
not
a
little
to
the
improvement
of
his
knowledge
and
taste
;
for
,
prejudice
apart
,
it
must
be
own
that
France
abound
with
man
of
consummate
honour
,
profound
sagacity
,
and
the
most
liberal
education
.
<EOS>
from
the
conversation
of
such
,
he
obtain
a
distinct
idea
of
their
government
and
constitution
;
and
though
he
could
not
help
admire
the
excellent
order
and
oeconomy
of
their
police
,
the
result
of
all
his
inquiry
be
self
-
congratulation
on
his
title
to
the
privilege
of
a
british
subject
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
invaluable
birthright
be
render
conspicuous
by
such
flagrant
occurrence
,
which
fall
every
day
almost
under
his
observation
,
that
nothing
but
the
gross
prejudice
could
dispute
its
existence
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XLIV
acquire
a
distinct
idea
of
the
french
government
;
quarrel
with
a
mousquetaire
,
whom
he
afterwards
fight
and
vanquishe
,
after
have
punish
him
for
interfere
in
his
amorous
recreation
.
   
<EOS>
among
many
other
instance
of
the
same
nature
,
I
believe
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
exhibit
a
few
specimen
of
their
administration
,
which
happen
during
his
abode
at
Paris
,
that
those
who
have
not
the
opportunity
of
observe
for
themselves
,
or
be
in
danger
of
be
influence
by
misrepresentation
,
may
compare
their
own
condition
with
that
of
their
neighbour
,
and
do
justice
to
the
constitution
under
which
they
live
.
    
<EOS>
a
lady
of
distinguished
character
have
be
lampoon
by
some
obscure
scribler
,
who
could
not
be
discover
,
the
ministry
,
in
consequence
of
her
complaint
,
order
no
few
than
five
and
twenty
abbe
to
be
apprehend
and
send
to
the
Bastile
,
on
the
maxim
of
Herod
,
when
he
command
the
innocent
to
be
murder
,
hope
that
the
principal
object
of
his
cruelty
would
not
escape
in
the
general
calamity
;
and
the
friend
of
those
unhappy
prisoner
durst
not
even
complain
of
the
unjust
persecution
,
but
shrug
up
their
shoulder
,
and
in
silence
deplore
their
misfortune
,
uncertain
whether
or
not
they
should
ever
set
eye
on
them
again
.
    
<EOS>
about
the
same
time
,
a
gentleman
of
family
,
who
have
be
oppress
by
a
certain
powerful
duke
that
live
in
the
neighbourhood
,
find
mean
to
be
introduce
to
the
king
,
who
receive
his
petition
very
graciously
,
ask
in
what
regiment
he
serve
;
and
when
the
memorialist
answer
,
that
he
have
not
the
honour
of
be
in
the
service
,
return
the
paper
unopene
,
and
refuse
to
hear
one
circumstance
of
his
complaint
;
so
that
,
far
from
be
redress
,
he
remain
more
than
ever
expose
to
the
tyranny
of
his
oppressor
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
notorious
be
the
discouragement
of
all
those
who
presume
to
live
independent
of
court
-
favour
and
connexion
,
that
one
of
the
gentleman
,
whose
friendship
Peregrine
cultivate
,
frankly
own
he
be
in
possession
of
a
most
romantic
place
in
one
of
the
province
,
and
deeply
enamour
of
a
country
life
;
and
yet
he
durst
not
reside
upon
his
own
estate
,
lest
by
slacken
in
his
attendance
upon
the
great
,
who
honour
him
with
their
protection
,
he
should
fall
a
prey
to
some
rapacious
intendant
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
common
people
,
they
be
so
much
inure
to
the
scourge
and
insolence
of
power
,
<EOS>
that
every
shabby
subaltern
,
every
beggarly
cadet
of
the
noblesse
,
every
low
retainer
to
the
court
,
insult
and
injure
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
a
certain
Ecuyer
,
or

dealer
,
belong
to
the
king
,
be
one
day
under
the
hand
of
a
barber
,
who
by
accident
cut
the
head
of
a
pimple
on
his
face
<EOS>
,
he
start
up
,
and
draw
his
sword
,
wound
him
desperately
in
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
poor
tradesman
,
hurt
as
he
be
,
make
an
effort
to
retire
,
and
be
follow
by
this
barbarous
assassin
,
who
not
content
with
the
vengeance
he
have
take
,
plunge
his
sword
a
second
time
into
his
body
,
and
kill
him
on
the
spot
.
    
<EOS>
have
perform
this
inhuman
exploit
,
he
dress
himself
with
great
deliberation
,
and
go
to
Versailles
,
immediately
obtain
a
pardon
for
what
he
have
do
;
triumph
in
his
brutality
with
such
insolence
,
that
the
very
next
time
he
have
occasion
to
be
shave
,
he
sit
with
his
sword
ready
draw
,
in
order
to
repeat
the
murder
,
in
case
the
barber
should
commit
the
same
mistake
.
<EOS>
yet
so
tamed
be
those
poor
people
to
subjection
,
that
when
Peregrine
mention
this
assassination
to
his
own
trimmer
,
with
expression
of
horror
and
detestation
,
the
infatuate
wretch
reply
,
that
without
all
doubt
it
be
a
misfortune
,
but
it
proceed
from
the
gentleman
's
passion
;
and
observe
,
by
way
of
encomium
on
the
government
,
that
such
vivacity
be
never
punish
in
France
.
    
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
this
outrage
be
commit
,
our
youth
,
who
be
a
professed
enemy
to
all
oppression
,
be
in
one
of
the
first
loge
at
the
comedy
,
be
eye
-
witness
of
an
adventure
which
fill
him
with
indignation
:
a
tall
,
ferocious
fellow
in
the
parterre
,
without
the
least
provocation
,
but
prompt
by
the
meer
wantonness
of
pride
,
take
hold
of
the
hat
of
a
very
decent
young
man
who
happen
to
stand
before
him
,
and
twirl
it
round
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
party
thus
offend
turn
to
his
aggressor
,
and
civilly
ask
the
reason
of
such
treatment
;
but
he
receive
no
answer
;
and
when
he
look
the
other
way
,
the
insult
be
repeat
:
upon
which
he
express
his
resentment
as
become
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
desire
the
offender
to
walk
out
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
he
thus
signify
his
intention
,
than
his
adversary
,
swell
with
rage
,
cock
his
hat
fiercely
in
his
face
,
and
fix
his
hand
in
his
side
,
pronounce
with
the
most
imperious
tone
,
"
Heark
ye
,
Mr
Round
Periwig
<EOS>
,
you
must
know
that
I
be
a
mousquetaire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Scarce
have
this
awful
word
escape
from
his
lip
,
when
the
blood
forsook
the
lip
of
the
poor
challenger
,
who
with
the
most
abject
submission
beg
pardon
for
his
presumption
,
and
with
difficulty
obtain
it
,
on
condition
that
he
should
immediately
quit
the
place
.
<EOS>
have
thus
exercise
his
authority
,
he
turn
to
one
of
his
companion
,
and
with
an
air
of
disdainful
ridicule
,
tell
him
he
be
like
to
have
have
an
affair
with
a
Bourgeois
;
add
,
by
way
of
heighten
the
irony
,
"
egad

<EOS>
I
believe

be
a
physician
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
so
much
shocked
and
irritated
at
this
licentious
behaviour
,
that
he
could
not
suppress
his
resentment
,
which
he
manifest
,
by
say
to
this
Hector
,
"
Sir
,
a
physician
may
be
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
remonstrance
,
which
be
deliver
with
a
very
significant
countenance
,
the
mousquetaire
make
no
other
reply
,
but
that
of
ecchoe
his
assertion
with
a
loud
laugh
,
in
which
he
be
join
by
his
confederate
;
and
Peregrine
glow
with
resentment
,
call
him
a
Fanfaron
,
and
withdraw
,
in
expectation
of
be
follow
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
other
understand
the
hint
,
and
a
rencounter
must
have
ensue
,
have
not
the
officer
of
the
guard
,
who
overhear
what
pass
,
prevent
their
meeting
,
by
put
the
mousquetaire
immediately
under
arrest
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
wait
at
the
door
of
the
parterre
,
until
he
be
inform
of
this
interposition
,
and
then
go
home
very
much
chagrin
at
his
disappintment
;
for
he
be
an
utter
stranger
to
fear
and
diffidence
on
these
occasion
,
and
have
set
his
heart
upon
chastise
the
insolence
of
this
bully
,
who
have
treat
him
with
such
disrespect
.
    
<EOS>
this
adventure
be
not
so
private
but
that
it
reach
the
ear
of
Mr
Jolter
,
by
the
canal
of
some
english
gentleman
who
be
present
when
it
happen
;
and
the
governor
,
who
entertain
a
most
dreadful
idea
of
the
mousquetaire
,
be
alarm
at
a
quarrel
,
the
consequence
of
which
may
be
fatal
to
his
charge
,
wait
on
the
british
embassador
,
and
beg
he
would
take
Peregrine
under
his
immediate
protection
.
<EOS>
His
excellency
have
hear
the
circumstance
of
the
dispute
,
send
one
of
his
gentleman
to
invite
the
youth
to
dinner
;
and
after
have
assure
him
that
he
may
depend
upon
his
countenance
and
regard
,
represent
the
rashness
and
impetuosity
of
his
conduct
so
much
to
his
conviction
,
that
he
promise
to
act
more
circumspectly
for
the
future
,
and
drop
all
thought
of
the
mousquetaire
from
that
moment
.
    
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
he
have
take
this
laudable
resolution
,
Pipes
,
who
have
carry
a
billet
to
his
mistress
,
inform
him
,
that
he
have
perceive
a
laced
hat
lie
upon
a
marble
slab
in
her
apartment
;
and
that
when
she
come
out
of
her
own
chamber
to
receive
the
letter
,
she
appear
in
manifest
disorder
.
    
<EOS>
from
these
hint
of
intelligence
,
our
young
gentleman
suspect
,
or
rather
make
no
doubt
of
her
infidelity
;
and
be
by
this
time
<EOS>
well
nigh
cloy
with
possession
,
be
not
sorry
to
find
that
she
have
give
him
cause
to
renounce
her
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
that
he
may
therefore
detect
her
in
the
very
breach
of
duty
,
and
at
the
same
time
punish
the
gallant
who
have
the
presumption
to
invade
his
territory
,
he
concert
with
himself
a
plan
,
which
be
execute
in
this
manner
:
during
his
next
interview
with
his
Dulcinea
,
far
from
discover
the
least
sign
of
jealousy
or
discontent
,
he
affect
the
appearance
of
extraordinary
fondness
;
and
after
have
spend
the
afternoon
with
the
shew
of
uncommon
satisfaction
,
tell
her
he
be
engage
in
a
party
for
Fountainbleau
,
and
would
set
out
from
Paris
that
same
evening
;
so
that
he
should
not
have
the
pleasure
of
see
her
again
for
some
day
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
,
who
be
very
well
verse
in
the
art
of
her
occupation
,
pretend
to
receive
this
piece
of
news
with
great
affliction
,
and
conjure
him
with
such
mark
of
real
tenderness
,
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
her
long
arm
,
that
he
go
away
almost
convinced
of
her
sincerity
.
<EOS>
determine
,
however
,
to
prosecute
his
scheme
,
he
actually
depart
from
Paris
with
two
or
three
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
have
hire
a
Remise
for
a
jaunt
to
Versailles
;
and

Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Peregrine
<EOS>
have
burst
open
the
chamber

,
find
the
lady
in
the
utmost
dread
and
consternation
,
and
the
spoil
of
her
favourite
scatter
about
the
room
:
but
his
resentment
be
doubly
gratify

when
he
learn
upon
inquiry
,
that
the
person
who
have
be
so
disagreeably
interrupted
,
be
no
other
than
that
individual
mousquetaire
with
whom
he
have
quarrel
at
the
comedy
.
<EOS>
He
upbraid
the
nymph
with
her
perfidy
and
ingratitude
,
and
tell
her
that
she
must
not
expect
the
continuance
of
his
regard
,
or
the
appointment
which
she
have
hitherto
enjoy
from
his
bounty
,
go
home
to
his
own
lodging
,
overjoy
at
the
issue
of
the
adventure
.
    
<EOS>
the
soldier
,
exasperate
at
the
disgrace
he
have
undergo
,
as
well
as
at
the
outragious
insult
of
the
english
valet
,
whom
he
believe
his
master
have
tutor
for
that
purpose
,
no
sooner
extricate
himself
from
the
opprobrious
situation
he
have
incur
,
than
breathe
vengeance
against
the
author
of
the
affront
,
he
come
to
Peregrine
's
apartment
,
and
demand
satisfaction
upon
the
rampart
next
morning
before
sun
-
rise
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
assure
him
,
he
would
not
fail
to
pay
his
respect
to
him
at
the
time
and
place
appoint
;
and
foreseeing
that
he
may
be
prevent
from
keep
this
engagement
by
the
officious
care
of
his
governor
,
who
see
the
mousquetaire
come
in
,
he
tell
Mr
Jolter
,
that
the
Frenchman
have
visit
him
in
consequence
of
an
order
he
have
receive
from
his
superior
,
to
make
an
apology
for
his
rude
behaviour
to
him
in
the
playhouse
,
and
that
they
have
part
very
good
friend
.
<EOS>
this
assurance
,
together
with
Pickle
's
tranquil
and
unconcerned
behaviour
thro
'
the
day
,
quiet
the
terror
which
have
begin
to
take
possession
of
his
tutor
's
imagination
;
so
that
the
youth
have
an
opportunity
of
give
him
the
slip
at
night
,
when
he
betake
himself
to
the
lodging
of
a
friend
,
whom
he
engage
as
his
second
,
and
with
whom
he
immediately
take
the
field
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
search
which
Jolter
,
upon
miss
him
,
may
set
on
foot
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
necessary
precaution
;
for
as
he
do
not
appear
at
supper
,
and
Pipes
,
who
usually
attend
him
in
his
excursion
,
could
give
no
account
of
his
motion
,
the
governor
be
dreadfully
alarm
at
his
absence
,
and
order
his
man
to
run
in
quest
of
his
master
to
all
the
place
which
he
use
to
frequent
,
while
he
himself
go
to
the
commissaire
,
and
communicate
his
suspicion
,
be
accommodate
with
a
party
of
the
horse
-
guard
,
who
patrol
round
all
the
environ
of
the
city
,
with
a
view
of
prevent
the
rencounter
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
may
have
direct
them
to
the
lady
,
by
whose
information
they
could
have
learn
the
name
and
lodging
of
the
mousquetaire
,
who
be
apprehend
,
the
duel
would
not
have
happen
;
but
he
do
not
choose
to
run
the
risk
of
disoblige
his
master
,
by
intermeddle
in
the
affair
,
and
be
,
moreover
,
very
desirous
that
the
Frenchman
should
be
humble
;
for
he
never
doubt
that
Peregrine
be
more
than
a
match
for
any
two
man
in
France
.
<EOS>
in
this
confidence
,
therefore
,
he
seek
his
master
with
great
diligence
,
not
with
a
view
of
disappoint
his
intention
,
but
in
order
to
attend
him
to
the
battle
,
that
he
may
stand
by
him
,
and
see
justice
do
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
inquiry
be
carry
on
,
our
hero
and
his
companion
conceal
themselves
among
some
weed
that
grow
on
the
edge
of
the
parapet
,
a
few
yard
from
the
spot
where
he
have
agree
to
meet
the
mousquetaire
;
and
scarce
have
the
morning
render
object
distinguishable
,
when
they
perceive
their
man
advance
boldly
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
see
them
approach
,
spring
forward
to
the
ground
,
that
he
may
have
the
glory
of
anticipate
his
antagonist

<EOS>
Pickle
's
eagerness
have
well
nigh
cost
him
his

for
,
without

his

,
he
fly
directly
to
his
opposite
,
and
stumble
over
a
stone
,
be
wound
on
one
side
of
his
head
before
he
could
recover
his
attitude
.

at
this
check

it
serve
only
to
animate
him
the

uncommon
agility
,
he
retrieve
his
posture
in
a
moment
,
and
have
parry
a
second
thrust
,
return
the
longe
with
such
incredible
speed
,
that
the
soldier
have
not
time
to
resume
his
guard
,
but
be
immediately
run
through
the
bend
of
his
right
arm
;

of

<EOS>
have
dispatch
his
own
business
,
and
receive
the
acknowledgment
of
his
adversary
,
who
with
a
look
of
infinite
mortification
observe
,
that
his
be
the
fortune
of
the
day
,
he
run
to

just
as
the

out
of
his
companion

hand
:
upon
which
he
take
his
place
;
and
,
in
all
likelihood
,
an
obstinate
dispute
would
have
ensue
,
have
they
not
be
interrupt
by
the
guard
,
at
sight
of
whom
the
two
Frenchmen
scamper
off
,
while
our
young
gentleman
and
his
friend
allow
themselves
to
be
take
prisoner
by
the
detachment
which
have
be
send
out
for
that
purpose

when

pipe
see
the
blood
trickle
down
upon
his
master
's
neckcloth
and

evident
token
of
surprize

concern
,
not
for
the

the

Chapter
XLV
   
<EOS>
Though
Mr
Jolter
be
extremely
well
pleased
at
the
safety
of
his
pupil
,
he
could
not
forgive
him
for
the
terror
and
anxiety
he
have
undergo
on
his
account
;
and
roundly
tell
him
,
that
notwithstanding
the
inclination
and
attachment
he
have
to
his
person
,
he
would
immediately
depart
for
England
,
if
ever
he
should
hear
of
his
be
involve
in
such
another
adventure
;
for
it
could
not
be
expect
that
he
would
sacrifice
his
own
quiet
,
to
an
unrequited
regard
for
one
who
seem
determined
to
keep
him
in
continual
uneasiness
and
apprehension
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
declaration
Pickle
make
answer
,
that
Mr
Jolter
,
by
this
time
,
ought
to
be
convince
of
the
attention
he
have
always
pay
to
his
ease
and
satisfaction
;
since
he
well
know
,
that
he
have
ever
look
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
friend
rather
than
as
a
counsellor
or
tutor
,
and
desire
his
company
in
France
with
a
view
of
promote
his
interest
,
and
not
for
any
emolument
he
could
expect
from
his
instruction
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
he
be
at
liberty
to
consult
his
own
inclination
with
regard
to
go
or
stay
;
though
he
could
not
help
own
himself
oblige
by
the
concern
he
express
for
his
safety
,
and
would
endeavour
,
for
his
own
sake
,
to
avoid
give
him
any
cause
of
disturbance
in
time
to
come
.
    
<EOS>
no
man
be
more
capable
of
moralize
upon
Peregrine
's
misconduct
than
himself
;
his
reflection
be
extremely
just
and
sagacious
,
and
attend
with
no
other
disadvantage
,
but
that
of
occur
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
project
a
thousand
salutary
scheme
of
deportment
,
but
,
like
other
projector
,
he
never
have
interest
enough
with
the
ministry
of
his
passion
to
bring
any
one
of
them
to
bear
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
in
the
heyday
of
his
gallantry
,
receive
a
letter
from
his
friend
Gauntlet
,
with
a
kind
postscript
from
his
charming
Emilia
;
but
it
arrive
at
a
very
unseasonable
juncture
,
when
his
imagination
be
engross
by
conquest
that
more
agreeably
flatter
his
ambition
;
so
that
he
could
not
find
leisure
and
inclination
,
from
that
day
,
to
honour
the
correspondence
which
he
himself
have
sollicite
;
and
his
vanity
have
,
by
this
time
,
disapprove
of
the
engagement
he
have
contract
in
the
rawness
and
inexperience
of
youth
;
suggest
,
that
he
be
bear
to
make
such
an
important
figure
in
life
,
as
ought
to
raise
his
idea
above
the
consideration
of
any
such
middling
connection
,
and
fix
his
attention
upon
object
of
the
most
sublime
attraction
.
<EOS>
these
dictate
of
ridiculous
pride
have
almost
efface
the
remembrance
of
his
amiable
mistress
,
or
at
least
so
far
warp
his
moral
and
integrity
,
that
he
actually
begin
to
conceive
hope
of
her
altogether
unworthy
of
his
own
character
and
her
desert
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
be
destitute
of
a
toy
for
the
dalliance
of
his
idle
hour
,
he
employ
several
spy
,
and
almost
every
day
make
a
tour
of
the
public
place
in
person
,
with
a
view
of
procure
intelligence
of
Mr
Hornbeck
,
with
whose
wife
he
long
to
have
another
interview
;
and
in
this
course
of
expectation
have
he
exercise
himself
a
whole
fortnight
,
when
chance
to
be
at
the
hospital
of
the
invalid
with
a
gentleman
lately
arrive
from
England
,
he
no
sooner
enter
the
church
than
he
perceive
this
lady
,
attend
by
her
spouse
,
who
at
sight
of
our
hero
change
colour
,
and
look
another
way
,
in

to
discourage
any
communication
between
them

but
the
young
man
,
who
be
not
so
easily
repulse

advanced
with
great
assurance
to
his
fellow

traveller
,
and
take
him
by
the
hand
,
express
his
satisfaction
at
this
unexpected
meeting
;
and
kindly
upbraid
him
for
his
precipitate
retreat
from
Chantilly
,
before
Hornbeck
could
make
any
reply
,
he
go
up
to
his
wife
,
whom
he
compliment
in
the
same
manner
,
assure
her
with
some
significant
glance
,
he
be
extremely
mortified
,
that
she
have
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
pay
his
respect
to
her
,
on
his
first
arrival
at
Paris
;
and
then
turn
to
her
husband
,
who
think
proper
to
keep
close
to
him
in
this
conference
,
beg
to
know
where
he
could
have
the
honour
of
wait
upon
him
;
observe
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
himself
live
a

<EOS>
Mr
Hornbeck
,
without
make
an
apology
for
his
elopement
on
the
road
,
thank
Mr
Pickle
for
his
complaisance
in
a
very
cool
and
disoblige
manner
;
say
,
that
as
he
intend
to
shift
his
lodging
in
a
day
or
two
,
he
could
not
expect
the
pleasure
of
see
him
,
until
he
should
be
settle
,
when
he
would
call
at
the
academy
,
and
conduct
him
to
his
new
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
be
not
unacquainted
with
the
sentiment
of
this
jealous
gentleman
,
do
not
put
much
confidence
in
his
promise
,
and
therefore
make
diver
effort
to
enjoy
a
little
private
conversation
with
his
wife
;
but
he
be
baffle
in
all
his
attempt
by
the
indefatigable
vigilance
of
her
keeper
,
and
reap
no
other
immediate
pleasure
from
this
accidental
meeting
,
than
that
of
a
kind
squeeze
while
he
hand
her
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
have
be
witness
to
some
instance
of
her
invention
,
and
be
no
stranger
to
the
favourable
disposition
of
her
heart

entertain
some
faint

and
do
not
fail
to
obey
the
summon
at
the
hour
of
assignation
;
when
the
lady
,
true
to
her
appointment
,
beckon
him
up
stair
,
and
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
admit
unseen
.
    
<EOS>
after
the
first
transport
of
their
mutual
joy
at
meeting
,
she
tell
him
,
that
her
husband
have
be
very
surly
and
cross
ever
since
the
adventure
at
Chantilly
,
which
he
have
not
yet
digest
;
that
he
have
lay
severe
injunction
upon
her
to
avoid
all
commerce
with
Pickle
,
and
even
threaten
to
shut
her
up
in
a
convent
for
life
,
if
ever
she
should
discover
the
least
inclination
to
renew
that
acquaintance
;
that
she
have
be
coope
up
in
her
chamber
since
her
arrival
at
Paris
,
without
be
permit
to
see
the
place
,
or
indeed
any
company
,
except
that
of
her
landlady
,
whose
language
she
do
not
understand
;
so
that
her
spirit
be
break
,
and
her
health
impair
,
he
be
prevail
upon
some
day
ago
to
indulge
her
in
a
few
airing
,
during
which
she
have
see
the
garden
of
the
Luxembourg
,
the
Thuilleries
and
Palais
Royal
,
though
at
those
time
when
there
be
no
company
in
the
walk
;
and
that
it
be
in
one
of
those
excursion
she
have
the
happiness
of
meeting
with
him
.
<EOS>
finally
,
she
give
him
to
understand
,
that
rather
than
continue
longer
in
such
confinement
with
the
man
whom
she
could
not
love
,
she
would
instantly
give
him
the
slip
,
and
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
her
lover
.
    
<EOS>
Rash
and
unthinking
as
this
declaration
may
be
,
the
young
gentleman
be
so
much
of
a
gallant
,
that
he
would
not
baulk
the
lady
's
inclination
,
and
too
infatuate
by
his
passion
to
foresee
the
consequence
of
such
a
dangerous
step
;
he
therefore
,
without
hesitation
,
embrace
the
proposal
,
and
the
coast
be
clear
,
they
sally
into
the
street
,
where
Peregrine
call
a
Fiacre
,
order
the
coachman
to
drive
them
to
a
tavern
:
but
know
it
would
not
be
in
his
power
to
conceal
her
from
the
search
of
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
if
she
should
remain
within
the
wall
of
Paris
,
he
hire
a
Remise
,
and
carry
her
that
same
evening
to
Villejuif
,
about
four
league
from
town
,
where
he
stay
with
her
all
night
;
and
have
board
her
on
a
genteel
pension
,
and
settle
the
oeconomy
of
his
future
visit
,
return
next
day
to
his
own
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
enjoy
his
success
,
her
husband
endure
the
torture
of
the
damned
.
<EOS>
when
he
return
from
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
understand
that
his
wife
have
elope
,
without
be
perceive
by
any
person
in
the
family
,
he
begin
to
rave
and
foam
at
the
mouth
with
rage
and
jealousy
,
and
in
the
fury
of
distraction
,
accuse
the
landlady
of
be
an
accomplice
in
her
escape
,
threaten
to
complain
of
her
to
the
commissaire
.
<EOS>
the
woman
could
not
conceive
how
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
who
she
know
be
an
utter
stranger
to
the
french
language
,
and
keep
no
sort
of
company
,
could
elude
the
caution
of
her
husband
,
and
find
any
refuge
in
a
place
where
she
have
no
acquaintance
,
and
begin
to
suspect
the
lodger
's
emotion
be
no
other
than
an
affected
passion
to
conceal
his
own
practice
upon
his
wife
,
who
have
perhaps
fall
a
sacrifice
to
his
jealous
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
spare
him
the
trouble
of
put
his
menace
in
execution
,
by
go
to
the
magistrate
without
any
further
deliberation
,
and
give
an
account
of
what
she
know
concern
this
mysterious
affair
,
with
certain
insinuation
against
Hornbeck
's
character
,
which
she
represent
as
peevish
and
capricious
to
the
last
degree
.
    
<EOS>
while
she
thus
anticipate
the
purpose
of
the
plaintiff
,
her
information
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
the
party
himself
,
who
exhibit
his
complaint
with
such
evident
mark
of
perturbation
,
anger
and
impatience
,
that
the
commissaire
could
easily
perceive
that
he
have
no
share
in
the
disappearance
of
his
wife
;
and
direct
him
to
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
whose
province
it
be
to
take
cognizance
of
such
occurrence
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
who
preside
over
the
city
of
Paris
,
have
hear
the
particular
of
Hornbeck
's
misfortune
,
ask
if
he
suspect
any
individual
person
as
the
seducer
of
his
yoke
-
fellow
;
and
when
he
mention
Peregrine
as
the
object
of
his
suspicion
,
grant
a
warrant
and
a
detachment
of
soldier
,
to
search
for
and
retrieve
the
fugitive
.
    
<EOS>
the
husband
conduct
them
immediately
to
the
academy
where
our
hero
lodge
,
and
have
rummage
the
whole
place
,
to
the
astonishment
of
Mr
Jolter
,
without
find
either
his
wife
or
the
suppose
ravisher
,
accompany
them
to
all
the
public
house
in
the
Fauxbourg
;
which
have
examine
also
without
success
<EOS>
,
he
return
to
the
magistrate
in
a
state
of
despair
,
and
obtain
a
promise
of
his
make
such
an
effectual
inquiry
,
that
in
three
day
he
should
have
an
account
of
her
,
provide
she
be
alive
,
and
within
the
wall
of
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
who
have
foresee
all
this
disturbance
,
be
not
at
all
surprize
when
his
governor
tell
him
what
have
happen
;
and
be
conjure
to
restore
the
woman
to
the
right
owner
,
with
many
pathetic
remonstrance
touch
the
heinous
sin
of
adultery
,
the
distraction
of
the
unfortunate
husband
,
and
the
danger
of
incur
the
resentment
of
an
arbitrary
government
,
which
,
upon
application
be
make
,
would
not
fail
of
espouse
the
cause
of
the
injure
;
he
deny
,
with
great
effrontery
,
that
he
have
the
least
concern
in
the
matter
,
pretend
to
resent
the
deportment
of
Hornbeck
,
whom
he
threaten
to
chastise
for
his
scandalous
suspicion
,
and
express
his
displeasure
at
the
credulity
of
Jolter
,
who
seem
to
doubt
the
veracity
of
his
asseveration
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
confident
behaviour
,
Jolter
could
not
help
entertain
doubt
of
his
sincerity
;
and
visit
the
disconsolate
swain
,
beg
he
would
,
for
the
honour
of
his
country
,
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
his
own
reputation
,
discontinue
his
address
to
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
and
apply
to
the
British
Embassador
,
who
by
dint
of
friendly
admonition
,
would
certainly
prevail
upon
Mr
Pickle
to
do
him
all
the
justice
in
his
power
,
if
he
be
really
the
author
of
the
injury
he
have
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
the
governor
urge
this
advice
with
the
appearance
of
so
much
sympathy
and
concern
,
promise
to
co
-
operate
with
all
his
influence
in
his
behalf
,
that
Hornbeck
embrace
the
proposal
,
communicate
his
purpose
to
the
magistrate
,
who
commend
the
resolution
as
the
most
decent
and
desirable
expedient
he
could
use
,
and
then
wait
upon
his
excellency
,
who
readily
espouse
his
cause
,
and
send
for
the
young
gentleman
that
same
evening
,
read
him
such
a
lecture
in
private
,
as
extort
a
confession
of
the
whole
affair
;
not
that
he
assail
him
with
sour
and
supercilious
maxim
,
or
severe
rebuke
,
because
he
have
penetration
enough
to
discern
,
that
Peregrine
's
disposition
be
impregnable
to
all
such
attack
;
but
he
first
of
all
rally
him
upon
his
intriguing
genius
,
then
,
in
an
humorous
manner
,
describe
the
distraction
of
the
poor
cuckold
,
who
he
own
be
justly
punish
for
the
absurdity
of
his
conduct
;
and
lastly
,
upon
the
supposition
,
that
it
would
be
no
great
effort
in
Pickle
to
part
with
such
a
conquest
,
especially
after
it
be
for
some
time
possess
,
represent
the
necessity
and
expediency
of
restore
her
,
not
only
out
of
regard
to
his
own
character
,
and
that
of
his
nation
,
but
also
with
a
view
to
his
ease
,
which
would
in
a
little
time
be
very
much
invade
by
such
an
incumbrance
,
that
in
all
probability
would
involve
him
in
a
thousand
difficulty
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
assure
him
,
that
he
be
already
,
by
order
of
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
surround
with
spy
,
who
would
watch
all
his
motion
,
and
immediately
discover
the
retreat
in
which
he
have
deposit
his
prize
.
<EOS>
these
argument
,
and
the
frank
familiar
manner
in
which
they
be
deliver
,
but
above
all
,
the
last
consideration
,
induce
the
young
gentleman
to
disclose
the
whole
of
his
proceeding
to
the
Embassador
,
and
promise
to
be
govern
by
his
direction
,
provide
the
lady
should
not
suffer
for
the
step
she
have
take
,
but
be
receive
by
her
husband
with
due
reverence
and
respect
.
    
<EOS>
these
stipulation
be
agree
to
,
he
undertake
to
produce
her
in
eight
and
forty
hour
;
and
take
coach
immediately
,
drive
to
the
place
of
her
residence
,
where
he
spend
a
whole
day
and
a
night
in
convince
her
of
the
impossibility
of
their
enjoy
each
other
in
that
manner
;
and
return
to
Paris
,
deliver
her
into
the
hand
of
the
Embassador
,
who
have
assure
her
,
that
she
may
depend
upon
his
friendship
and
protection
,
in
case
she
should
find
herself
aggrieve
by
the
jealous
temper
of
Mr
Hornbeck
,
restore
her
to
her
legitimate
lord
,
whom
he
counsel
to
exempt
her
from
that
restraint
which
,
in
all
probability
,
have
be
the
cause
of
her
elopement
,
and
endeavour
to
conciliate
her
affection
by
tender
and
respectful
usage
.
    
<EOS>
the
husband
behave
with
great
humility
and
compliance
,
protest
that
his
chief
study
should
be
to
contrive
party
for
her
pleasure
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
he
regain
possession
of
his
stray
-
sheep
,
than
he
lock
her
up
more
closely
than
ever
;
and
after
have
revolve
various
scheme
for
her
reformation
,
determine
to
board
her
in
a
convent
,
under
the
inspection
of
a
prudent
abbess
,
who
should
superintend
her
moral
,
and
recal
her
to
the
path
of
virtue
,
which
she
have
forsake
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
consult
an
english
priest
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
advise
him
to
settle
her
in
a
monastery
at
Lisle
,
that
she
may
be
as
far
as
possible
from
the
machination
of
her
lover
;
and
give
him
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
superior
of
a
certain
convent
in
that
place
,
for
which
Mr
Hornbeck
set
out
in
a
few

with
his
troublesome
charge

Chapter
XLVI
Peregrine
resolve
to
return
to
England
,
be
divert
with
the
odd
character
of
two
of
his
countryman
,
with
whom
he
contract
an
acquaintance
in
the
apartment
of
the
Palais
Royal
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
our
hero
receive
a
letter
from
his
aunt
,
import
that
the
commodore
be
in
a
very
declining
way
,
and
long
much
to
see
him
at
the
garison
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
hear
from
his
sister
,
who
give
him
to
understand
that
the
young
gentleman
who
have
for
some
time
make
his
address
to
her
,
be
become
very
pressing
in
his
solicitation
;
so
that
she
want
to
know
in
what
manner
she
should
answer
his
repeat
intreatie
.
<EOS>
these
two
consideration
determine
the
young
gentleman
to
return
to
his
native
country
,
a
resolution
that
be
far
from
be
disagreeable
to
Jolter
,
who
know
that
the
incumbent
on
a
living
which
be
in
the
gift
of
Trunnion
,
be
extremely
old
,
and
that
it
would
be
his
interest
to
be
upon
the
spot
at
the
say
incumbent
's
decease
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
have
reside
about
fifteen
month
in
France
,
think
he
be
now
sufficiently
qualified
for
eclipse
most
of
his
cotemporarie
in
England
,
and
therefore
prepared
for
his
departure
with
infinite
alacrity
,
be
moreover
inflame
with
the
most
ardent
desire
of
revisit
his
friend
,
and
renew
his
connection
,
particularly
with
Emilia
,
<EOS>
whose
heart
,
he
by
this
time
,
think
he
be
able
to
reduce
on
his
own
term
.
    
<EOS>
as
he
propose
to
make
the
tour
of
Flanders
and
Holland
in
his
return
to
England
,
he
resolve
to
stay
in
Paris
a
week
or
two
after
his
affair
be
settle
,
in
hope
of
find
some
agreeable
companion
dispose
for
the
same
journey
,
and
in
order
to
refresh
his
memory
,
make
a
second
circuit
round
all
the
place
in
that
capital
,
where
any
curious
production
of
art
be
to
be
see
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
second
examination
he
chance
to
enter
the
Palais
Royal
,
just
as
two
gentleman
alight
from
a
Fiacre
at
the
gate
,
and
all
three
be
admit
at
the
same
time
,
he
soon
perceive
that
the
stranger
be
of
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
a
young
man
,
in
whose
air
and
countenance
appear
all
the
uncouth
gravity
and
supercilious
self
-
conceit
of
a
physician
piping
hot
from
his
study
,
while
the
other
,
to
whom
his
companion
speak
by
the
appellation
of
Mr
Pallet
,
display
at
first
sight
a
strange
composition
of
levity
and
assurance
.
<EOS>
indeed
their
character
,
dress
and
address
be
strongly
contrast
;
the
doctor
wear
a
suit
of
black
,
and
a
huge
tyewig
,
neither
suitable
to
his
own
age
,
nor
the
fashion
of
the
country
where
he
then
live
;
whereas
the
other
,
though
seemingly
turn
of
fifty
,
strut
in
a
gay
summer
dress
of
the
parisian
cut
,
with
a
bag
to
his
own
grey
hair
,
and
a
red
feather
in
his
hat
,
which
he
carry
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
as
these
figure
seem
to
promise
something
entertaining
,
Pickle
enter
into
conversation
with
them
immediately
,
and
soon
discover
that
the
old
gentleman
be
a
painter
from
London
,
who
have
steal
a
fortnight
from
his
occupation
,
in
order
to
visit
the
remarkable
painting
of
France
and
Flanders
;
and
that
the
doctor
have
take
the
opportunity
of
accompany
him
in
his
tour
.
<EOS>
be
extremely
talkative
,
he
not
only
communicate
these
particular
to
our
hero
in
a
very
few
minute
after
their
meeting
,
but
also
take
occasion
to
whisper
in
his
ear
,
that
his
fellow
traveller
be
a
man
of
vast
learning
,
and
beyond
all
doubt
,
the
great
poet
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
as
for
himself
,
he
be
under
no
necessity
of
make
his
own
elogium
;
for
he
soon
give
such
specimen
of
his
taste
and
talent
,
as
left
Pickle
no
room
to
doubt
of
his
capacity
.
    
<EOS>
while
they
stand
consider
the
picture
in
one
of
the
first
apartment
,
which
be
by
no
means
the
most
masterly
composition
,
the
Swiss
,
who
set
up
for
a
connoisseur
,
look
at
a
certain
piece
,
pronounce
the
word
magnifique
!
<EOS>
with
a
note
of
admiration
;
upon
which
Mr
Pallet
,
who
be
not
at
all
a
critick
in
the
french

in

flounder

it

here
again
the

out
of

express

these

animate
him
to

in
his
curious
observation

celebrated

perceive
that
the

manifest
no
sign
of
pleasure

satisfaction

but
rather
beheld
them
with
a
silent
air
of
disdain

he
could
not

ask
with

that
there
be
nothing
there
which
deserve
the
attention

eminent
in

whether
they
do

deem
it
his

magnify

the

never

indeed
our

so
successfully
accommodate

from

accompany

to
the
cloister

they
consider
the
history
of
St

paultry

in
the
opinion

it
be
a
most
masterly
performance

have
satisfy
their
curiosity
in

place

Peregrine
sollicite
them
to
favour
him
with
their
company
at
dinner

whether
out
of
caution
against
the
insinuation
of
one
whose
character
they
do
not
know
,
or
by
reason
of
a
prior
engagement

they
decline
his
invitation
on
pretence
of
have
an
appointment
at
a
certain
ordinary
,
though
they
express
a
desire
of
be
farther
acquaint
with
him
;
and
Mr

take
the
freedom
of
ask
his
name
,
which
he
not
only
declare
,
but
promise
,
as
they
be
stranger
in

to
wait

next

remarkable
for

They
thankfully
embrace
his
proposal
,
and
that
same
day
make
inquiry
among
the
english
gentleman
,
about
the
character
of
our
hero
,
which
they
find
so
much
to
their
satisfaction
,
that
upon
their
second
meeting
,
they
court
his
good
grace
without
reserve
;

as
they
have
hear
of

beg
earnestly

not
be
happy
,
nor
the
earth
yield
its
fruit
in
abundance
,
under
a
restricted
clergy
and
limited
government
:
whereas
,
in
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
it
be
an
eternal
truth
,
that
no
constitution
be
so
perfect
as
the
democracy
,
and
that
no
country
could
flourish
,
but
under
the
administration
of
the
mob
.
    
<EOS>
these
consideration
be
premise
,
no
wonder
that
they
happen
to
disagree
in
the
freedom
of
an
unreserved
conversation
,
especially
as
their
entertainer
take
all
opportunity
of
encouraging
and
inflame
the
contention
.
<EOS>
the
first
source
of
their
difference
be
an
unlucky
remark
of
the
painter
,
who
observe
that
the
partridge
of
which
he
be
then
eat
,
have
the
fine
relish
of
any
he
have
ever
taste
.
<EOS>
His
friend
own
that
the
bird
be
the
good
of
the
kind
he
have
see
in
France
;
but
affirm
that
they
be
neither
so
plump
nor
delicious
as
those
that
be
catch
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
governor
consider
this
observation
as
the
effect
of
prejudice
and
inexperience
,
say
with
a
sarcastical
smile
,
"
I
believe
,
sir

you
be
very
well
disposed
to
find
every
thing
here
inferior
to
the

and
pray
,
(

why
may
not
the
partridge
of

be
as
good
as
those
of
England

<EOS>
"
for
a
very
plain

the

this

Mr

ironically

the

the

affront
at
the
insinuation

tell
him

some
warmth
,
that
he
be
mistaken
in
his
conjecture

his
affection

idea
be
confine
to
no

country

for
he
consider
himself
as
a
citizen
of
the
world

<EOS>
He
own
himself
more
attached
to
England
than
to
any
other
kingdom
,
but
this
preference
be
the
effect
of
reflexion
,
and
not
of

because
the
british
constitution
approach
near

to
that
perfection
of

,
the
democracy
of
Athens
,
which
he
hope
one

revive

he
mention
the
death
of
Charles
the
first
,
and
the
expulsion
of
his

with
rapture
of
applause
,
inveigh
with
great
acrimony

in

repeat
forty

fifty
line

Philippicks
of
Demosthenes

<EOS>
jolter
hear
him
speak
so
disrespectfully

<EOS>
He
say
his
doctrine
be
detestable

destructive
of
all
right

order
and
society
;
that
monarchy
be
of
divine
institution
,
therefore
indefeasible
by
any
human
power
;
and
of
consequence
those
event
in
the
english
history
,
which
he
have
so
liberally
commend
,
be
no
other
than
flagrant
instance
of
sacrilege

perfidy
,
and
sedition
;
that
the
democracy
of
Athens
be
a
most
absurd
constitution

productive
of
anarchy

which
must
always
happen
when

act

the
most
ungrateful
and
imprudent
manner
,
against
the
great
patriot
that
their
country
have
produce
:
and
finally
,
he
aver
,
that
the
liberal
art
and
science
have
never
flourish
so
much
in
a
republick
,
as
under
the
encouragement
and
protection
of
absolute
power
;
witness
the
Augustan
age
,
and
the
reign
of
Lewis
the
fourteenth
:
nor
be
it
to
be
suppose
that
genius
and
merit
could
ever
be
so
amply
recompense
by
the
individual
,
or
distract

Mr

whose

look

model
his

he

with
all
the
insolence

advise
him
to
beware
of

for
the

on
his

so
elevated

he
declaim
a
full
hour
on
the
absurdity
of

his
harangue
with
the
great

an
italian

a

baron

whom

know
to
be

the

by

communicative

the

numerous
difficulty

that

to
obey

in
thing
that
be
contrary

that
although

engage
a
person
,
by
an
extraordinary
premium
,
to
comply
with
his
order

the

be
so
astonished
,
mortify
and
incense
at
the
command
he
have
receive
,
that
his
hair
stand
on
end
,
and
he
beg
on
his
knee
,
to
be
release
from
the
agreement
he
have
make
:
but
find
that
his
employer
insist
upon
the
performance
of
his
contract
,
and
threaten
to
introduce
him
to
the
commissaire
,
if
he
should
flinch
from
the
bargain

he
have
,
in
the
discharge

wept

sung

caper
for

whole

so
that

to
have

and
,
in
all

,
he
would
never

<EOS>
while
the
company
listen
to
this
odd
information
,
by
which
they
be
prepossess
with
strange
notion
of
the
dinner

their
ear

piteous
voice

but
this
pathetic
supplication
have
no

upon
the

who
in
all
likelihood
pour
in

with
his
own
hand
,
the
sauce
against
which
the
cook
have

the

the
french
marquis

the
honour

be
concern
at
this
declaration

profess
his
sorrow
for
what
have
happen

so
contrary

<EOS>
the
mutual
compliment
that
pass
on
this
occasion

scarce
finish

when
a
servant
come
into
the
room
,
announce
dinner
;
and
the
entertainer
lead
the
way
into
another
apartment
,
where
they
find
a
long
table
,
or
rather
two
board
join
together
,
and
furnish
with
a
variety
of
dish
,
the
steam
of
which
have
such
evident
effect
upon
the
nerve
of
the
company
,
that
the
marquis
make
frightful
grimace
,
under
pretence
of
take
snuff
;
the
Italian
's
eye
water
,
the
German
's
visage
undergo
violent
distortion
of
feature
;
our
hero
find
mean
to
exclude
the
odour
from
his
sense
of
smell
,
by
breathe
only
through
his
mouth
;
and
the
poor
painter
run
into
another
room
,
plug
his
nostril
with
tobacco
.
    
<EOS>
the
doctor
himself
,
who

point

a
couple
of
couch
place
on

side

tell
his
guest
,
that
he
be
sorry
<EOS>
he
could
not
procure
the
exact
triclinia
of
the
ancient
,
which
be
somewhat
different
from
these
conveniencie
,
and
desire
they
would
have
the
goodness
to
repose
themselves
without
ceremony
,
each
in
his
respective
couchette
,
while
he
and
his
friend
Mr
Pallet
would
place
themselves
upright
at
the
end
,
that
they
may
have
the
pleasure
of
serve
those
that
lie
along
.
<EOS>
this
disposition
,
of
which
the
stranger
have
no
previous
idea
,
disconcert
and
perplex
them
in
a
most
ridiculous
manner
;
the
marquis
and
baron
stand
bow
to
each
other
,
on
pretence
of
dispute
the
low
seat
,
but
in
reality
with
a
view
of
profit
by
the
example
of
one
another
,
for
neither
of
them
understand
the
manner
in
which
they
be
to
loll
;
and
Peregrine
,
who
enjoy
their
confusion
,
hand
the
count
to
the
other
side
,
where
,
with
the
most
mischievous
politeness
,
he
insist
upon
his
take
possession
of
the
upper
place
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
disagreeable
and
ludicrous
suspence
they
continue
act
a
pantomime
of
gesticulation
,
until
the
doctor
earnestly
intreate
them
to
wave
all
compliment
and
form
,
lest
the
dinner
should
be
spoil
before
the
ceremonial
could
be
adjust
.
<EOS>
thus
conjure
,
Peregrine
take
the
low
couch
on
the
left
-
hand
side
,
lay
himself
gently
down
,
with
his
face
towards
the
table
.
<EOS>
the
marquis
,
in
imitation
of
this
pattern
(
though
he
would
have
much
rather
fast
three
day
than
run
the
risk
of
discompose
his
dress
by
such
an
attitude
)
stretch
himself
upon
the
opposite
place
,
recline
upon
his
elbow
in
a
most
painful
and
aukward
situation
,
with
his
head
raise
above
the
end
of
the
couch
,
that
the
oeconomy
of
his
hair
may
not
suffer
by
the
projection
of
his
body
.
    
<EOS>
the
Italian
be
a
thin
,
limber
creature
,
plant
himself
next
to
Pickle
,
without
sustain
any
misfortune
,
but
that
of
his
stocking
be
tear
by
a
ragged
nail
of
the
seat
,
as
he
raise
his
leg
on
a
level
with
the
rest
of
his
limb
.
<EOS>
but
the
baron
,
who
be
neither
so
wieldy
nor
supple
in
his
joint
as
his
companion
,
flounce
himself
down
with
such
precipitation
,
that
his
foot
suddenly
tilt
up
,
come
in
furious
contact
with
the
head
of
the
marquis
,
and
demolish
every
curl
in
a
twinkling
,
while
his
own
skull
,
at
the
same
instant
,
descend
upon
the
side
of
his
couch
with
such
violence
,
that
his
periwig
be
strike
off
,
and
the
whole
room
fill
with
pulvilio
.
    
<EOS>
the
drollery
of
distress
that
attend
this
disaster
entirely
vanquish
the
affected
gravity
of
our
young
gentleman
,
who
be
oblige
to
suppress
his
laughter
by
cram
his
handkerchief
in
his
mouth
;
for
the
bare
-
head
German
ask
pardon
with
such
ridiculous
confusion
,
and
the
marquis
admit
his
apology
with
such
rueful
complaisance
,
as
be
sufficient
to
awake
the
mirth
of
a
quietist
,
whose
insensibility
be
not
utterly
extinguish
.
    
<EOS>
this
misfortune
be
repair
as
well
as
the
circumstance
of
the
occasion
would
permit
,
and
every
one
settle
accord
to
the
arrangement
already
describe
,
the
doctor
graciously
undertake
to
give
some
account
of
the
dish
as
they
occur
,
that
the
company
may
be
direct
in
their
choice
;
and
with
an
air
of
infinite
satisfaction
thus
begin
:
    
"

I
wish
for
your

it
be
one
of
the

so
much

the
magnitude
of
their

one

with
this
food

exquisite
as
it
be
,
do
the
tyrant
Heliogabalus
regale
his
hound
.
<EOS>
but
I
beg
pardon
,
I
have
almost
forget
the
soup
,
which
I
hear
be
so
necessary
an
article
at
all

<EOS>
at
each

the
other

much
the

the
soup

maigre
of

of
roasted

<EOS>
Monsieur
le
baron

shall
I
help
you
to
a
plate
of
this
soup
?
"
<EOS>
the
German
,
who
do
not
at
all
disapprove
of
the
ingredient
,
assent
to
the
proposal
,
and
seem
to
relish
the
composition
;
while
the
marquis
,
be
ask
by
the
painter
which
of
the
silly
-
kickaby
he
choose
,
be
in
consequence
of
his
desire
accommodate
with
a
portion
of
the
soup
maigre
;
and
the
count
,
in
lieu
of
spoon
-
meat
,
of
which
he
say
he
be
no
great
admirer
,
supply
himself
with
a
pigeon
,
therein
conform
to
the
choice
of
our
young
gentleman
,
whose
example
he
determine
to
follow
through
the
whole
course
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
have
swallow
the
first
spoonful
,
make
a
full
pause
<EOS>
,
his
throat
swell
,
as
if
an
egg
have
stick
in
his
gullet
,
his
eye
roll
,
and
his
mouth
undergo
a
series
of
involuntary
contraction
and
dilatation

<EOS>
Pallet
,
who
look
stedfastly
at
this
connoisseur
,
with
a
view
of
consult
his
taste
,
before
he
himself
would
venture
upon
the
soup
,
begin
to
be
disturb
at
these
emotion
,
and
observe
with
some
concern
,
that
the
poor
gentleman
seem
to
be
go
into
a
fit
;
when
Peregrine
assure
him
that
these
be
symptom
of
extasy
,
and
for
further
confirmation
,
ask
the
marquis
how
he
find
the
soup
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
infinite
difficulty
that
his
complaisance
could
so
far
master
his
disgust
,
as
to
enable
him
to
answer
,
"
altogether
excellent
,
upon
my
honour
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
painter
be
certify
of
his
approbation
,
lift
the
spoon
to
his
mouth
without
scruple
;
but
,
far
from
justify
the
elogium
of
his
taster
,
when
this
precious
composition
diffuse
itself
upon
his
palate
,
he
seem
to
be
deprive
of
all
sense
and
motion
,
and
sit
like
the
leaden
statue
of
some
river
god
,
with
the
liquor
flow
out
at
both
side
of
his
mouth

<EOS>
the
doctor
,
alarm
at
this
indecent
phaenomenon
,
earnestly
inquire
into
the
cause
of
it
;
and
when
Pallet
recover
his
recollection
,
and
swear
that
he
would
rather
swallow
porridge
make
of
burn
brimstone
,
than
such
an
infernal
mess
as
that
which
he
have
taste
,
the
physician
,
in
his
own
vindication
,
assure
the
company
,
that
,
except
the
usual
ingredient
,
he
have
mix
nothing
in
the
soup
but
some
sal
armoniac
instead
of
the
ancient
nitrum
,
which
could
not
now
be
procure
;
and
appeal
to
the
marquis
,
whether
such
a
succedaneum
be
not
an
improvement
on
the
whole
.
    
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
petit
maitre
,
drive
to
the
extremity
of
his
condescension
,
acknowledge
it
to
be
a
masterly
refinement
;
and
deem
himself
oblige
,
in
point
of
honour
,
to
evince
his
sentiment
by
his
practice
,
force
a
few
more
mouthful
of
this
disagreeable
potion
down
his
throat
,
till
his

be
so
much
offend

that
he
be
compel
to
start
up
of
a
sudden
,
and
in
the
hurry
of
his
elevation
overturn
his
plate
into
the
bosom
of
the
baron
.
<EOS>
the
emergency
of
his
occasion
would
not
permit
him
to
stay
and
make
apology
for
this
abrupt
behaviour
,
so
that
he
fly
into
another
apartment
,
where
Pickle
find
him
puke

and
cross
himself
with
great
devotion
;

particular
excuse
him
to
the

on
account
of
the
violent
fit
of
illness
with
which
he
have
be
seize

<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
that

employ
a
mediator

up

while

in
High

appease
his

his

for

that
there

the

which

;
that

sometimes
of

which

a

of

and
sometimes

:
<EOS>
nay

he

that

of
the

it

Mean
<EOS>
while

he
regret
his
incapacity
to
give
them
a
speciman
of
the

or

of
the
ancient

such
as
the

the

,
which
in
Galen

opinion

hard
of

,
the
cornuta

describe
by
Pliny
in
his
Natural
History
,
who
say
,
the
horn
of
many

be
a

a

the

of

six

He
observe

that
the

them

describe
by
Horace

in
the
account
he

of
the

that
they

commonly

the

a
certain
anodyne
and
astringent
seed
,
which
qualify
the

nature
of

<EOS>
finally
,
this

give
them
to
understand
,
that
though
this
be
reckon
a
luxurious

in
the
zenith
of
the
roman
taste
,
it
be
by
no
mean
comparable
,
in

to
some
preparation
in

about

of
that
absurd
voluptuary
Heliogabalus

of
six
hundred

and
the

be
not
a
little
rejoice
to
see
plain
olive
in
salt
and
water
:
but
what
the
master
of
the
feast
value
himself
upon
,
be
a
sort
of
jelly
,
which
he
affirm
to
be
preferable
to
the
hypotrimma
of
Hesychius
,
be
a
mixture
of
vinegar
,
pickle
and
honey
,
boil
to
a
proper
consistence
,
and
candy
assa
foetida
,
which
he
assert
,
in
contradiction
to
Humelbergius

Lister
,
be
no
other
than
the
laser
syriacum
,
so
precious
,
as
to
be
sell
among
the
ancient
to
the
weight
of
a
silver
penny
.
    
<EOS>
the
gentleman
take
his
word
for
the
excellency
of
this
gum
,
but
content
themselves
with
the
olive
,
which
give
such
an
agreeable
relish
to
the
wine
,
that
they
seem
very
well
disposed
to
console
themselves
for
the
disgrace
they
have
endure
;
and
Pickle
,
unwilling
to
lose
the
least
circumstance
of
entertainment
that
could
be
enjoy
in
their
company
,
go
in
quest
of
the

his
penitential
in
another

not

persuade

enter

until
Peregrine
undertake

procure
his
pardon
from
those

he
have
injure

<EOS>
have
assure
him
of
this
indulgence
,
our
young
gentleman
lead
him
in
like
a
criminal
,
bow
on
all
hand
with
an
air
of
humility
and
contrition
;
and
particularly
address
himself
to
the
count
,
to
whom
he
swear
in
English
,
as
God
be
his
saviour
,
he
have
no
intent
to
affront
man
,
woman

or
child

but
be
fain
to
make
the
good
of

that
he
may
not
give
the
honourable

cause
of
offence

the

<EOS>
when

interpret
this
apology
to
the

Pallet
be
forgive
in
very
polite
term
,
and
even
receive
into
favour
by
his

the

in

so
that

in
a
troublesome
adventure

and
with
his
companion

to
the
Bastile

<EOS>
the
painter
,
at
the
request
of
Pickle
,
who
have
a
design
upon
the
count
's
sense
of
hearing
,
favour
the
company
with
the
song
of
Bumper
Squire
Jones
,
which
yield
infinite
satisfaction
to
the
baron
;
but
affect
the
delicate
ear
of
the
Italian
in
such
a
manner
,
that
his
feature
express
astonishment
and
disquiet
;
and
by
his
sudden
and
repeat
journey
to
the
door
,
it
plainly
appear
,
that
he
be
in
the
same
predicament
with
those
who
,
as
Shakespear
observe
,
when
the
bagpipe
sing
in
the
nose
,
can
not
contain
their
urine
for

with
a
view

of
vindicate
music
from
such
a
barbarous
taste
,
Mr
Pallet
have
no
sooner
perform
his
task
,
than
the
count
honour
his
friend
with
some
favourite
air
of
his
own
country
,
which
he
warble
with
infinite
grace
and
expression
,
though
they
have
not
energy
sufficient
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
german
,
who
fall
fast
asleep
upon
his
couch
,
and
snore
so
loud
,
as
to
interrupt
,
and
totally
annul
this
ravish
entertainment
;
so
that
they
be
fain
to
have
recourse
again
to
the
glass
,
which
make
such
innovation
upon
the
brain
of
the
physician
,
that
he
sing
diver
ode
of
Anacreon
to
a
tune
of
his
own
composing
,
and
hold
forth
upon
the
music
and
recitative
of
the
ancient
with
great
erudition
;
while
Pallet
,
have
find
mean
to
make
the
italian
acquaint
with
the
nature
of
his
profession
,
harangue
upon
paint
with
wonderful
volubility
,
in
a
language
which
(
it
be
well
for
his
own
credit
)
<EOS>
the
stranger
do
not
understand
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
the
doctor
be
seize
with
such
a
qualm
,
that
he
beg
Peregrine
to
lead
him
to
his
chamber
;
and
the
count
,
tired
with
the
eternal
babble
of
the
painter
,
reel
towards
the
sleep
baron
,
whom
he
view
with
rapture
,
repeat
from
the

then
boldly
ravish
a
kiss
,
and
begin
to
tickle
him
under
the
rib
,
with
such
expression
of
tenderness
,
as
scandalize
the
virtuous
painter
,
who
,
conscious
of
his
own
attraction
,
be
alarm
for
his
person
,
and
stagger
in
great
hurry
and
discomposure
into
the
next
room
,
where
he
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
our
hero
,
to
whom
he
impart
his
suspicion
of
the
count
's
moral
,
by
describe
the
indecency
of
his
deportment
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
entertain
a
just
detestation
for
all
such
abominable
practice
,
be
incense
at
this
information
;
and
step
to
the
door
of
the
dining
-
room
where
the
two
stranger
be
leave
together
,
see
with
his
own
eye
enough
to
convince
him
,
that
Pallet
's
complaint
be
not
without
foundation
,
and
that
the
baron
be
not
averse
to
the
address
of
the
count
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
's
indignation
have
well
nigh
prompt
him
to
rush
in
,
and
take
immediate
vengeance
on
the
offender
;
but
,
consider
that
such
a
precipitate
step
may
be
attend
with
troublesome
consequence
to

,
he
resist
the
impulse
of

wrath

and
task
his
invention
with
some
method
of
inflict
upon

a
disgrace
suited
to

grossness

<EOS>
after

them
up
in
bag
,
with
a
reasonable
quantity
of
ballast
in
each

and
throw
them
over
the
Pont
Neuf
into
the
river
;
his
imagination
could
not
supply
him
with
an
expedient
to
his
liking
,
and
he
be
at
a
loss
how
to
behave
,
when
the
landlady
of
the
house
,
whom
he
know
to
be
a
dame
of
remarkable
vivacity
,
chance
to
pass
,
furnish
him
with
a
hint
,
of
which
he
immediately
take
the
advantage
,
by
beg
she
would
do
him
the
favour
to
step
into
the
next
room
,
and
tell
the
gentleman
,
that
he
would
be
with
them
as
soon
as
the

could
be
put
to

<EOS>
the
lady
very
graciously
undertake
the
office
,
and
enter
the
apartment
,
be
so
much
offended
and
enrage
at
the
mutual
endearment
of
the
two

,
that
instead
of
deliver
the
message
with
which
she
have
be
entrust
,
she
set
the
trumpet
of
reproach
to
her
mouth
,
and
seize
the
baron
's
cane
,
which
she
find
upon
the
side
-
table
,
belabour
them
both
with
such
eagerness
of
animosity
,
that
they
find
themselves
oblige
to
make
a
very
disorderly
retreat
,
and
be
actually
drive
down
stair
,
in
a
most
disgraceful
condition
,
by
this
exasperate
virago
,
who
load
them
with
just
invective
all
the
way
,
publish
their
shame
,
not
only
to
those
of
her
own
family
,
but
likewise
to
the
populace
,
who
begin
to
crowd
about
the
door
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
espouse
her
revenge
,
have
not
their
lacquey
,
who
be
in
wait
,
convey
the
delinquent
into
the
Remise
,
and
carry
them
off
with
great
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
so
delighted
with
the
manner
of
the
chastisement
they
have
undergo
,
that
he
embrace
the
mistress
of
the
hotel
with
transport
,
for
the
spirit
she
have
exert
;
and
be
render
frolicksome
with
the
wine
he
have
drink
,
propose
that
he
and
Pallet
should
go
to
a
masquerade
,
which
he
recollect
<EOS>
be
to
be
give
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
painter
do
not
want
curiosity
and
inclination
to
accompany
him
,
but
express
his
apprehension
of
lose
him
in
the
ball
;
an
accident
which
could
not
fail
to
be
very
disagreeable
,
as
he
be
an
utter
stranger
to
the
language
and
the
town
.
<EOS>
to
obviate
this
objection
,
the
landlady
,
who
be
of
their
council
,
advise
him
to
appear
in
a
woman
's
dress
,
which
would
lay
his
companion
under
the
necessity
of
attend
him
with
more
care
,
as
he
could
not
with
decency
detach
himself
from
the
lady
whom
he
should
introduce
:
<EOS>
besides
,
such
a
suppose
connexion
would
hinder
the
lady
of
pleasure
from
accost
,
and
employ
their
seduce
art
upon
a
person
already
engage
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
foresee
abundance
of
diversion
in
the
execution
of
this
project
,
second
the
proposal
with
such
importunity
and
address
,
that
the
painter
allow
himself
to
be
habit
in
a
suit
belong
to
the
landlady
,
who
also
procure
for
him
a
mask
and
domino
,
while
Pickle
provide
himself
with
a
spanish
dress
.
<EOS>
in
this
disguise
,
which
they
put
on
about
eleven
o'clock
,
do
they
,
attend
by
Pipes
,
set
out
in
a
Fiacre
for
the
ball
-
room
,
into
which
Pickle
lead
this
supposititious
female
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
whole
company
,
who
have
never
see
such
an
uncouth
figure
in
the
appearance
of
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
after
they
have
take
a
view
of
all
the
remarkable
masque
,
and
the
painter
have
be
treat
with
a
glass
of
liqueur
,
his
mischievous
companion
give
him
the
slip
,
and
vanish
in
an
instant
,
return
with
another
mask
and
a
domino
over
his
habit
,
that
he
may
enjoy
Pallet

perplexity
,
and
be
at
hand
to
protect
him
from
insult

<EOS>
the
poor
painter
have
lose
his
guide
,
be
almost
distract
with
anxiety
,
and
stalk
about
the
room
,
in
quest
of
him
,
with
such
huge
stride
and
oddity
of
gesture
,
that
he
be
follow
by
a
whole
multitude
,
who
gaze
at
him
as
a
preternatural
phaenomenon

<EOS>
this
attendance
increase
his
uneasiness
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
not
help
utter
a
soliloquy
aloud
,
in
which
he
curse
his
fate
for
have
depend
upon
the
promise
of
such
a
wag

and
swear

that
if
once
he
be
clear
of
this
scrape
,
he
would
not
bring
himself
into
such
a
premunire
again
for
the
whole
kingdom
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
petit
maitre
understand
the
masque
be
a
foreigner
,
who
in
all
probability
could
not
speak
French
,
make
up
to
him
in
their
turn
,
in
order
to
display
their
wit
and
address
,
and
teize
him
with
several
arch
question
;
to

he
make
no

,
"
no

<EOS>
damn
your

<EOS>
but
,
what
most
of
all
contribute
to
his
torture
and
mortification
,
be
a
press
call
from
nature
,
in
consequence
of
the
Champaign
he
have
so
liberally
swallow
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
in
the
character
of
a
woman
,
he
neither
know
whither
to
retire
,
nor
,
have
he
know
,
durst
he
run
the
risk
of
be
discover
,
in
such
a
situation
,
by
the
individual
of
that
sex
;
and
if
he
should
use
the
privilege
of
a
man
,
in
his
present
appearance
,
he
foresee
that
he
must
subject
himself
to
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
company

so
that
he
be
oblige
to
suffer
the
most
racking
pang
of

course
round

round
the

cast
many
a
woeful
look
among
the

at

the

be

more
indelicate

lend
him
such
a
box
on

ear

create
such
a
suspicion

that
the
nobleman
swear
he

either
a

insist
upon

scrutiny

for
the

<EOS>
Peregrine
at
once
conceive
the
meaning
of
this
arrest

and
it
be
well
for
him
that
he
have
no
weapon
wherewith
to

upon

defence

for
such
be
the
impetuosity

rashness
of

that

be
armed
,
he
would
have
run
all
risk
rather
than
surrender
himself
to
any
odd

Pallet
imagine
that
the
officer
be
some
gentleman
who
have
mistake
their
carriage
for
his

desire
his

to
undeceive
the

condition

his
knee
begin

his
tooth
to

doleful
lamentation

some
hideous
dungeon
of

should
spend
the
rest
of

in
misery
and
horror
,
and
never
see
the
light
of
God

sun
,
nor
the
face
of
a

;
but
perish
in
a
foreign
land

far
remove
from
his
family
and
connexion

damn
him
for
his
pusilanimity

a

bemoan

so
piteously

the

of

to
this
remonstrance
the

make
no

shrug
up
his

in
silent
astonishment
at
the

energy
to
the

that

leap
upon

give
his
antagonist
a
chuck
under

the

wring

in
the

when

this
unfortunate
piece

he
do

that
his

in
the
anguish

curse
the

have
by
reiterated
insult
provoke

may
not

however

neglect
any

in

to
extricate

he
dispatch

inform

immediately
dress
himself
and
repair
to
Jolter

whom
he
accost
in
these
word
:
"
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
I
hope
you
be
convince
of
your
error
,
in
assert
that
oppression
can
never
be
the
effect
of
arbitrary
power
.
<EOS>
such
a
calamity
as
this
could
never
have
happen
under
the
athenian
democracy
:
<EOS>
nay
,
even
when
the
tyrant
Pisistratus
get
possession
of
that
commonwealth
<EOS>
,
he
durst
not
venture
to
rule
with
such
absolute
and
unjust
dominion
.
    
<EOS>
You
shall
see
now
that
Mr
Pickle
and
my
friend
Pallet
will
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
tyrancy
of
lawless
power
;
and
in
my
opinion
,
we
shall
be
accessory
to
the
ruin
of
this
poor
enslave
people
,
if
we
bestir
ourselves
in
demand
,
or
implore
the
release
of
our
unhappy
countryman
;
as
we
may
thereby
prevent
the
commission
of
a
flagrant
crime
,
which
would
fill
up
the
vengeance
of
heaven
against
the
perpetrator
,
and
perhaps
be
the
mean
of
restore
a
whole
nation
to
the
unspeakable
fruition
of
freedom
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
should
rejoice
to
see
the
blood
of
my
father
spilt
in
such
a
glorious
cause
,
provide
such
a
victim
would
furnish
me
with
the
opportunity
of
dissolve
the
chain
of
slavery
,
and
vindicate
that
liberty
which
be
the
birth
-
right
of
man
.
<EOS>
then
would
my
name
be
immortalize
among
the
patriot
hero
of
antiquity
,
and
my
memory
like
that
of
Harmodius
and
Aristogiton
,
be
honour
by
statue
erect
at
the
public
expense
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
rhapsody
,
which
be
deliver
with
great
emphasis
and
agitation
,
give
so
much
offence
to
Jolter
,
that
without
speak
one
word
,
he
retire
in
great
wrath
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
the
republican
return
to
his
lodging
,
in
full
hope
of
his
prognostic
be
verify
in
the
death
and
destruction
of
Peregrine
and
the
painter
,
which
must
give
rise
to
some
renowned
revolution
,
wherein
he
himself
would
act
a
principal
part
.
<EOS>
but
the
governor
,
whose
imagination
be
not
quite
so
warm
and
prolifick
,
go
directly
to
the
Embassador
,
whom
he
inform
of
his
pupil
's
situation
,
and
besought
to
interpose
with
the
french
ministry
,
that
he
and
the
other
british
subject
may
obtain
their
liberty
.
    
<EOS>
His
excellency
ask
if
Jolter
could
guess
at
the
cause
of
his
imprisonment
,
that
he
may
be
the
better
prepared
to
vindicate
or
excuse
his
conduct
;
but
neither
he
nor
Pipes
could
give
the
small
hint
of
intelligence
on
that
subject
;
though
he
furnish
himself
from
Tom
's
own
mouth
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
manner
in
which
his
master
have
be
arrest
,
as
well
as
of
his
own
behaviour
,
and
the
disaster
he
have
receive
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
never
doubt
that
Pickle
have
bring
this
calamity
upon
himself
by
some
unlucky
prank
he
have
play
at
the
masquerade
;
especially
when
he
understand
that
the
young
gentleman
have
drink
freely
in
the
afternoon
,
and
be
so
whimsical
as
to
go
thither
with
a
man
in
woman
's
apparel
;
and
he
that
same
day
wait
on
the
french
minister
,
in
full
confidence
of
obtain
his
discharge
;
but
meet
with
more
difficulty
than
he
expect
,
the
court
of
France
be
extremely
punctilious
in
every
thing
that
concern
a
prince
of
the
blood
:
the
ambassador
be
,
therefore
,
oblige
to
talk
in
very
high
term
,
and
though
the
present
circumstance
of
the
french
politick
would
not
allow
them
to
fall
out
with
the
british
administration
for
trifle
,
all
the
favour
he
could
procure
,
be
a
promise
that
Pickle
should
be
set
at
liberty
,
provide
he
would
ask
pardon
of
the
prince
to
whom
he
have
give
offence
.
<EOS>
His
excellency
think
this
be
but
a
reasonable
condescension
,
suppose
Peregrine
to
have
be
in
the
wrong
;
and
Jolter
be
admit
to
him
,
in
order
to
communicate
and
reinforce
his
lordship
's
advice
,
which
be
that
he
should
comply
with
the
term
propose
.
<EOS>
the
governor
,
who
do
not
enter
this
gloomy
fortress
without
fear
and
tremble
,
find
his
pupil
in
a
dismal
apartment
void
of
all
furniture
,
but
a
stool
and
truckle
-
bed
;
the
moment
he
be
admit
,
he
perceive
the
youth
whistle
with
great
unconcern
,
and
work
with
his
pencil
at
the
bare
wall
,
on
which
he
have
delineate
a
ludicrous
figure
label
with
the
name
of
the
nobleman
whom
he
have
affront
,
and
an
english
mastiff
with
his
leg
lift
up
,
in
the
attitude
of
make
water
in
his
shoe
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
be
even
so
presumptuous
as
to
explain
the
device
with
satirical
inscription
in
the
french
language
,
which
when
Jolter
peruse
,
his
hair
stand
on
end
with
affright
.
<EOS>
the
very
turnkey
be
confound
and
overawe
by
the
boldness
of
his
behaviour
,
which
he
have
never
see
match
by
any
inhabitant
of
that
place
;
and
actually
join
his
friend
in
persuade
him
to
submit
to
the
easy
demand
of
the
minister
.
<EOS>
but
our
hero
,
far
from
embrace
the
counsel
of
this
advocate
,
hand
him
to
the
door
with
great
ceremony
,
and
dismiss
him
with
a
kick
on
the
breech
;
and
to
all
the
supplication
,
and
even
tear
of
Jolter
,
make
no
other
reply
,
than
that
he
would
stoop
to
no
condescension
,
because
he
have
commit
no
crime
;
but
would
leave
his
case
to
the
cognizance
and
exertion
of
the
british
court
,
whose
duty
it
be
to
see
justice
do
to
its
own
subject
:
he
desire
,
however
,
that
Pallet
,
who
be
confine
in
another
place
,
may
avail
himself
of
his
own
disposition
,
which
be
sufficiently
plyable
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
governor
desire
to
see
his
fellow
-
prisoner
,
the
turnkey
give
him
to
understand
that
he
have
receive
no
order
relate
to
the
lady
,
and
therefore
could
not
admit
him
into
her
apartment
;
though
he
be
complaisant
enough
to
tell
him
,
that
she
seem
very
much
mortify
at
her
confinement
,
and
at
certain
time
behave
as
if
her
brain
be
not
a
little
disorder
.
<EOS>
Jolter
thus
baffle
in
all
his
endeavour
,
quit
the
Bastile
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
report
his
fruitless
negociation
to
the
Embassador
,
who
could
not
help
break
forth
into
some
acrimonious
expression
against
the
obstinacy
and
insolence
of
the
young
man
,
who
,
he
say
,
deserve
to
suffer
for
his
folly
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
do
not
desist
from
his
representation
to
the
french
ministry
,
which
he
find
so
unyielding
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
threaten
in
plain
term
,
to
make
it
a
national
concern
;
and
not
only
write
to
his
court
for
instruction
,
but
even
advise
the
council
to
make
reprisal
,
and
send
some
french
gentleman
in
London
to
the
Tower
.
    
<EOS>
this
intimation
have
an
effect
upon
the
ministry
at
Versailles
,
who
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
incense
a
people
whom
it
be
neither
their
interest
nor
inclination
to
disoblige
,
consent
to
discharge
the
offender
,
on
condition
that
they
should
leave
Paris
in
three
day
after
their
enlargement
.
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
readily
agree
to
by
Peregrine
,
who
be
now
a
little
more
tractable
,
and
heartily
tired
of
be
coope
up
in
such
an
uncomfortable
abode
,
for
the
space
of
three
long
day
,
without
any
sort
of
communication
or
entertainment
,
but
that
which
his
own
imagination
suggest

Chapter
LI
Peregrine
make
himself
merry
at
the
expence
of
the
painter
,
who
curse
his
landlady
,
and
break
with
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
could
easily
conceive
the
situation
of
his
companion
in
adversity
,
he
be
unwilling
to
leave
the
place
,
until
he
have
reap
some
diversion
from
his
distress
,
and
with
that
view
repair
to
the
dungeon
of
the
afflict
painter
,
to
which
he
have
by
this
time
free
access
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
enter
,
the
first
object
that
present
itself
to
his
eye
,
be
so
uncommonly
ridiculous
,
that
he
could
scarce
preserve
that
gravity
of
countenance
which
he
have
affect
in
order
to
execute
the
joke
he
have
plan
.
<EOS>
the
forlorn
Pallet
sit
upright
in
his
bed
in
a
dishabille
that
be
altogether
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
He
have
lay
aside
his
monstrous
hoop
,
together
with
his
stay
,
gown
and
petticoat
,
wrap
his
lappet
about
his
head
by
way
of
night
-
cap
,
and
wear
his
domino
as
a
loose
morning
dress
;
his
grizzle
lock
hang
down
about
his
lack
-
lustre
eye
and
tawny
neck
,
in
all
the
disorder
of
negligence
;
his
grey
beard
bristle
about
half
an
inch
,
through
the
remain
of
the
paint
with
which
his
visage
have
be
bedaub
,
and
every
feature
of
his
face
be
lengthen
to
the
most
ridiculous
expression
of
grief
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
see
Peregrine
come
in
,
he
start
up
in
a
sort
of
frantic
extasy
,
and
run
towards
him
with
open
arm
,
no
sooner
perceive
the
woeful
appearance
into
which
our
hero
have
model
his
physiognomy
,
than
he
stop
short
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
the
joy
which
have
begin
to
take
possession
of
his
heart
,
be
in
a
moment
dispel
by
the
most
rueful
presage
;
so
that
he
stand
in
a
most
ludicrous
posture
of
dejection
,
like
a
malefactor
at
the
Old
Baily
,
when
sentence
be
about
to
be
pronounce
.
<EOS>
Pickle
take
him
by
the
hand
,
heave
a
profound
sigh
,
and
after
have
protest
that
he
be
extremely
mortified
at
be
pitch
upon
as
the
messenger
of
bad
news
,
tell
him
with
an
air
of
sympathy
and
infinite
concern
,
that
the
french
court
have
discover
his
sex
,
have
resolve
,
in
consideration
of
the
outrageous
indignity
he
offer
in
public
to
a
prince
of
the
blood
,
to
detain
him
in
the
Bastile
a
prisoner
for
life
;
and
that
this
sentence
be
a
mitigation
obtain
by
the
importunity
of
the
British
Embassador
;
the
punishment
ordain
by
law
be
no
other
than
break
alive
upon
the
wheel
.
    
<EOS>
these
tiding
aggravate
the
horror
of
the
painter
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
roar
aloud
,
and
skip
about
the
room
,
in
all
the
extravagance
of
distraction
;
take
God
and
man
to
witness
that
he
would
rather
suffer
immediate
death
,
than
endure
one
year
's
imprisonment
in
such
a
hideous
place
;
and
curse
the
hour
of
his
birth
,
and
the
moment
on
which
he
depart
from
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
for
my
own
part

(
say
his
tormenter
in
an
hypocritical
tone

the
bitter
pill

there

recovery

It

a

besides
,
upon
second

I
begin
to
imagine
that
you

not
for
such
a
trifle
sacrifice
yourself
to
the
uncease
horror
of
a
solitary
dungeon

<EOS>

interrupt
him
with
great
eagerness

beg
for
the
love
of
God
that
he
would
no

keep
him

torture
of

mention
that

<EOS>
Peregrine

thus
play
upon
his
passion

fear
and
hope
,
answer
,
that
as
the
offence
be
commit
in
the
habit
of
a
woman

which
be
a
disguise
unworthy

the
french

be
of
opinion
that

ever

<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman

have
hear
his
lamentation
to
an
end

excuse
himself
for
his
conduct
,
by
represent
,
that
he
could
not
possibly
foresee
the
disagreeable
consequence
that
attend
it
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
strenuously
counsel
him
to
submit
to
the
term
of
his
enlargement

<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
he
be
now
arrive
at
that
time
of
life
,
when
the
lust
of
the
flesh
should
be
entirely
mortify
within
him
,
and
his
great
concern
ought
to
be
the
health
of
his
soul
,
to
which
nothing
could
more
effectually
contribute
than
the
amputation
which
be
propose
:
that
his
body
,
as
well
as
his
mind
,
would
profit
by
the
change
,
because
he
would
have
no
dangerous
appetite
to
gratify
,
and
no
carnal
thought
to
divert
him
from
the
duty
of
his
profession
;
and
his
voice
,
which
be
naturally
sweet
,
would
improve
to
such
a
degree

that
he
would
captivate
the
ear

<EOS>
these
argument
do
not
fail
to
make
impression

the
painter

,
nevertheless

start
three
objection
to
his
compliance
;
namely
,
the
disgrace
of
the
punishment
,
the
pain
of
the
operation

the
dread
of
his
wife

<EOS>
Pickle
undertake
to
obviate
these
difficulty

by
assure
him
,
that
the
sentence
would
be
execute
so
privately

as
never
to
transpire
;
that
the
excision
(
as
he
have
learn
from
Motecelli
)
be
not
so
painful
as
the
drawing
of
a
tooth
,
and
that
his
wife
could
not
be
so
unconscionable
,
after
so
many
year
of
cohabitation
,
as
to
take
exception
to
an
expedient

by
which
she
would
not

enjoy
the
conversation

the
fruit

talent

remarkably
refine

<EOS>
Pallet
shake
his
head
at
this
last
remonstrance

if

it

not

altogether
convincing

yield
to
the
proposal

provide
her
consent
could
be
obtain

just
as

this
condescension

enter

himself

suppose
lady

express
his
satisfaction

the
honour
to
tell

as
the

do
not

one
word

what
he

Peregrine
undertake
the
office
of
interpreter

make
his
friend
believe

the
goaler
's
speech
be
no

than
an
intimation

send
a
surgeon

what

that
the
instrument

dressing

room

alarmed

terrify
at
this
sudden
appointment

he
fly
to
the
other
end
of
the
room

snatch
up
an
earthen
chamber
-
pot
,
which
be
the
only
offensive
weapon
in
the
place

put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defiance

with
many
oath
threaten
to
try
the
temper
of
the
barber

skull

set
his
nose
within

apartment

little
expect
such
a
reception

conclude
that
the
poor
gentlewoman
have
actually
lose
her
wit

retreat
with
precipitation

leave
the
door
open

go
out

upon

gather
up
the
particular
of

great
dispatch

cram
them
into

notice

follow
his
footstep

a
hackney

coach
flood
for

there
be
no
time

take
his
advice

without
quit
the
utensil
,
which
in
his
hurry
he
forget
to
lay
down
,
sally
out
in
the
rear
of
our
hero

with
all
that
wildness
of
terror
and
impatience
which
may
be
reasonably
suppose
to
take
possession
of
a
man
who
fly
from
castration
or
perpetual
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
tumult
of
his
agitation
,
that
his
faculty
of
thinking
be
for
the
present
utterly
overwhelmed
,
and
he
see
no
object
but
his
conductor
,
whom
he
follow
by
a
sort
of
instinctive
impulse
,
without
regard
the
keeper
and
centinel
,
who
,
as
he
pass
with
his
cloath
under
one
arm
,
and
his
chamber
-
pot
brandish
above
his
head
,
be
confound
,
and
even
dismay
at
the
strange
apparition
.
    
<EOS>
during
the
whole
course
of
this
irruption
,
he
cease
not
to
cry
with
great
vociferation
,
"
drive
,
coachman
,
drive
in
the
name
of
God
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
carriage
have
proceed
the
length
of
a
whole
street
,
before
he
manifest
the
least
sign
of
reflection
,
but
stare
like
the
Gorgon
's
head
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
each
particular
hair
crawling
and
twine
like
an
animate
serpent
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
begin
to
recover
the
use
of
his
sense
,
and
ask
if
Peregrine
think
him
now
out
of
all
danger
of
be
retake
.
<EOS>
this
unrelenting
wag
,
not
yet
satisfied
with
the
affliction
he
have
impose
upon
the
sufferer
,
answer
with
an
air
of
doubt
and
concern
,
that
he
hope
they
would
not
be
overtaken
,
and
pray
to
God
they
may
not
be
retard
by
an
Embaras
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
fervently
join
in
this
supplication
,
and
they
advance
a
few
yard
further
,
when
the
noise
of
a
coach
at
full
speed
behind
them
,
invade
their
ear
;
and
Pickle
have
look
out
at
the
window
,
withdraw
his
head
in
seem
confusion
,
and
exclaim
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!

I
wish
that
may
not
be
a
guard
send
after
us

Methinks
<EOS>
I
see
the
muzzle
of
a
fusil
stick
out
of
the
coach
.

"
<EOS>
the
painter
hear
these
tiding
,
that
instant
thrust
himself
half
out
at
the
window
,
with
his
helmet
still
in
his
hand
,
bellow
to
the
coachman
as
loud
as
he
could
roar
,

for

I

the

<EOS>
the
painter
,
who
be
not
such
a
flaming
enthusiast
in
the
cause
of
liberty
,
could
not
brook
the
doctor
's
reflexion
,
which
he
think
savour
a
little
too
much
of
indifference
and
deficiency
in
point
of
private
friendship
;
and
therefore
seize
the
present
opportunity
of
mortify
his
pride
,
by
observe
,
that
the
image
be
,
without
all
doubt
,
very
grand
and
magnificent
;
but
that
he
have
be
oblige
for
the
idea
to
Mr
Bayes
in
the
Rehearsal
,
who
value
himself
upon
the

figure

convey
in

all
these
cloud

when
by
the
eye

grasp'd

c.
upon

the

would
have
triumph
greatly
in
this
detection

such
be
the
flutter

confusion
of
his
spirit

under
the
apprehension
of
be
retake
,
that
without
further
communication
,
he
retreat
to
his
own
room
,
in
order
to
resume
his
own
dress
,
which
he
hope
would
alter
his
appearance
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
baffle
all
search
and
examination
;
while
the
physician
remain
ashamed
and
abash
,
to
find
himself
convict
of
plagiarism
by
a
person
of
such
contemptible
talent

He
be
offend
at
this
proof

his
memory

so
much
enrage
at
his
presumption
in
exhibit
it
,
that
he
could
never
forgive
his
want
of
reverence
,
and
take
every
opportunity
of
expose
his
ignorance

folly
in
the
sequel

<EOS>
indeed
,
the
tie
of
private
affection
be
too
weak
to
engage
the
heart
of
this
republican
,
whose
zeal
for
the
community
have
entirely
swallow
up
his
concern
for
individual

He
look
upon
particular
friendship
as
a
passion
unworthy

ample
soul

be
a
professed
admirer
of

Manlius

him
with

upon

the

that
he
run
no

be
retake
;
and
far
from
repine
at
the
term
of
his
enlargement
,
would
have
willingly
set
out
on
his
return
to
England
that
same
afternoon
;
for
the
Bastile
have
make
such
an
impression
upon
him
,
that
he
start
at
the
sound
of
every
coach
,
and
turn
pale
at
sight
of
a
french
soldier
.
<EOS>
in
the
fullness
of
his
heart
,
he
complain
of
the
doctor
's
indifference
,
and
relate
what
have
pass
at
their
meeting
with
evident
mark
of
resentment
and
disrespect
;
which
be
not
at
all
diminish

when

inform
him
of
the
physician
's
behaviour
,
when
he
send
for
him
,
to
confer
about
the
mean
of

their
confinement

<EOS>
Pickle
himself
be
incense
at
his
want
of
bowel
,
and
perceive
how
much
he
have
sink
in
the
opinion
of
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
resolve
to
encourage
these
sentiment
of
disgust
,
and
occasionally
foment
the
division
to
a
downright
quarrel
,
which
he
foresaw
would
produce
some
diversion
,
and
perhaps
expose
the
poet
's
character
in
such
a
light
,
as
would
effectually
punish
him
for
his
arrogance
and
barbarity
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
level
several
satirical
joke
at
the
doctor
's
pedantry
and
want
of
taste
,
which
have
appear
so
conspicuous
in
the
quotation
he
have
get
by
heart
,
from
ancient
author
,
in
his
affected
disdain
of
the
good
picture
in
the
world
;
which
,
have
he
be
endow
with
the
least
share
of
discernment
,
he
could
not
have
behold
with
such
insensibility
;
and
lastly
,
in
his
ridiculous
banquet
,
which
none
but
an
egregious
coxcomb
,
devoid
of
all
elegance
and
sense
,
would
have
prepare

or
present
to

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
our
young
gentleman
play
the
artillery
of
his
wit
against
him
with
such
success
,
that
the
painter
seem
to
wake
from
a
dream
,
and
go
home
with
the
most
hearty
contempt
for
the
person
he
have
formerly
adore
.
    
<EOS>
instead
of
use
the
privilege
of
a
friend
,
to
enter
his

without

he
send

with

would

<EOS>
the
doctor
,
strike
with
the
manner
as
well
as
the
matter
of
this
intimation
,
go
immediately
to
Pallet
's
room
,
and
demand
to
know
the
cause
of
such
a
sudden
determination
,
without
his
privity
or
concurrence
;
and
when
he
understand
the
necessity
of
their
affair
,
rather
than
travel
by
himself
,
he
order
his
baggage
to
be
pack
up
,
and
signify
his
readiness
to
conform
to
the
emergency
of
the
case
;
though
he
be
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
cavalier
behaviour
of
Pallet
,
to
whom
he
throw
out
some
hint
of
his
own
importance
,
and
the
immensity
of
his
condescension
,
in
favour
him
with
such
mark
of
regard
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
these
insinuation
have
lose
their
effect
upon
the
painter
,
who
tell
him
with
an
arch
sneer
,
that
he
do
not
at
all
question
his
learning
and
ability
,
and
particularly
his
skill
in
cookery
,
which
he
should
never
forget
while
his
palate
retain
its
function
;
but
nevertheless
advise
him
,
for
the
sake
of
the
degenerate
eater
of
these
day
,
to
spare
a
little
of
his
sal
armoniac
in
the
next
sillykickaby
he
should
prepare
;
and
bate
somewhat
of
the
devil
's
dung
,
which
he
have
so
plentifully
cram
into
the
roast
fowl
,
unless
he
have
a

to
convert
his

into

,
with
a
view
of

himself
whole
for

<EOS>
the

at

eye
him
with
a
look
of
indignation
and
disdain
,
and
be
unwilling
to
express
himself
in

in
the
course
of

he
suppose
this

to
be

compliment
his
friend
upon
his
knowledge
in
the

and
find
mean
to
rally
him
quite
out

so

spend
the
evening
with
some
of
those
who
have
enjoy

prepare

<EOS>
all
the
provision
in
the
house
be
but
barely
sufficient
to
furnish
one
indifferent
meal
;
however
,
the

console
himself
for
the
quantity
with
the
quality
of
the
dish
,
one
of
which
be
a
fricassee
of
rabbit
,
a
preparation
that
he
value
above
all
the
dainty
that
ever
smoake
upon

our
hero

who
be
almost
incessantly
lay
trap
for
diversion
at
his
neighbour

lay
hold
on
the
declaration

recollect
the
story
of

the
muleteer
in

resolve
to
perpetrate
a
joke
upon
the
stomach
of

well
disposed

He
accordingly
digest
his
plan

affect
to
gaze
with
peculiar
eagerness
at
the
painter

who
have
help
himself
to
a
large
portion
of
the
fricassee

begin
to
swallow
it
with
infinite
relish

<EOS>
Pallet
,
notwithstanding
the
keenness
of
his
appetite

could
not
help
take
notice
of
Pickle
's
demeanour
;
and
make
a
short
pause
in
the
exercise
of
his
grinder
,
"
You
be
surprize
(
say
he

to
see
me
make
so
much
dispatch
;
but
I
be
extremely
hungry
,
and
this
be
one
of
the
good
fricassee
I
ever
taste
:
the
French
be
very
expert
in
these
dish
,
that
I
must
allow
;

upon
my
conscience

I
would
never

eat
a
more
delicate
rabbit

this
that
lie
upon

plate

make
no

the
repetition

with
a
note
of
admiration

such
a
significant
shake

alarm
the

instantly
suspend
the
action
of
his

with
the

stare
round
him

a
certain
stolidity

ask

the

inform
of
the
trick
which
be
commonly
play
at
inn
in
France
,
Italy
and
Spain
,
and
recount
that
passage
in
Gil
Blas
,
which
we
have
hint
at
above
;
say
,
he
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
connoisseur
in
animal
,
but
the
leg
of
the
creature
which
compose
that
fricassee
do
not
,
in
his
opinion
,
resemble
those
of
the
rabbit
he
have
usually
see
.
<EOS>
this
observation
have
an
evident
effect
upon
the
feature
of
the
painter
,
who
with
certain
sign
of
loathing
and
astonishment
,
exclaim
,
"
Lord
Jesus
!
"
and
appeal
to
Pipes
for
a
discovery
of
the
truth
,
by
ask
if
he
know
any
thing
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Tom
very
gravely
reply
,
that
he
do
suppose
the
food
be
wholesome
enough
,
for
he
have
see
the
skin
and
foot
of
a
special
ram
-
cat
,
new
flea'd
,
hang
upon
the
door
of
a
small
pantry
adjoin
to
the
kitchen
.
    
<EOS>
before
this
sentence
be
utter
,
Pallet
's
belly
seem
to
move
in
contact
with
his
back
-
bone
,
his
colour
change
,
no
part
but
the
white
of
his
eye
be
to
be
see
,
he
drop
his
low
jaw
,
and
fix
his
hand
in
his
side
,
reach
with
such
convulsive
agony
,
as
amazed
and
disconcert
the
whole
company
;
and
what
augment
his
disorder
,
be
the
tenacious
retention
of
his
stomach
,
which
absolutely
refuse
to
part
with
its
content
,
notwithstanding
all
the
energy
of
his
abhorrence
,
which
throw
him
into
a
cold
sweat
,
and
almost
into
a
swoon
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
alarm
at
his
condition
,
assure
him
it
be
a
genuine
rabbit
,
and
that
he
have
tutor
Pipes
to
say
otherwise
for
the
joke
's
sake
.
<EOS>
but
this
confession
he
consider
as
a
friendly
artifice
of
Pickle
's
compassion
,
and
therefore
it
have
little
effect
upon
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
by
the
assistance
,
however
,
of
a
large
bumper
of
brandy
,
his
spirit
be
recruit
,
and
his
recollection
so
far
recover
,
that
he
be
able
to
declare
,
with
diver
contorsion
of
face
,
that
the
dish
have
a
particular
rankness
of
taste
,
which
he
have
impute
partly
to
the
nature
of
the
french
coney
,
and
partly
to
the
composition
of
their
sauce
;
then
he
inveigh
against
the
infamous
practice
of
french
publican
,
attribute
such
imposition
to
their
oppressive
government
,
which
keep
them
so
necessitous
,
that
they
be
tempt
to
exercise
all
manner
of
knavery
upon
their
unwary
guest
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
let
slip
any
opportunity
of
speak
in
favour
of
the
French
,
tell
him
that
he
be
a
very
great
stranger
to
their
police
,
else
he
would
know
,
that
if
upon
information
to
the
magistrate
,
it
should
appear
that
any
traveller
,
native
or
foreigner
,
have
be
impose
upon
,
or
ill
-
treat
by
a
publican
,
the
offender
would
be
immediately
oblige
to
shut
up
his
house
,
and
if
his
behaviour
have
be
notorious
,
he
himself
would
be
send
to
the
gallie
,
without
the
least
hesitation
;
and
as
for
the
dish
which
hath
be
make
the
occasion
of
your
present
disorder
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
will
take
upon
me
to
affirm
<EOS>
,
it
be
prepare
of
a
genuine
rabbit
,
which
be
skin
in
my
presence
;
and
in
confirmation
of
what
I
assert
,
though
such
fricassee
be
not
the
favourite
of
my
taste
,
I
will
eat
a
part
of
this
without
scruple
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
swallow
several
mouthful
of
the
question
coney
,
and
Pallet
seem
to
eye
it
again
with
inclination
;
nay
,
he
even
resume
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
be
just
on
the
point
of
apply
them
,
be
seize
with
another
qualm
of
apprehension
,
that
break
out
in
an
exclamation
of
,
"
after
all
,
Mr
Jolter
,
if
it
should
be
a
real
ram
-
cat
 
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
here
be
one
of
the
claws
.
"
    
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
present
the
tip
of
a
toe
,
of
which
Pipes
have
snipt
off
five
or
six
from
a
duck
that
be
roast
,
and
purposely
scatter
them
in
the
fricassee
:
and
the
governor
could
not
behold
this
testimonial
without
symptom
of
uneasiness
and
remorse
;
so
that
he
and
the
painter
sit
silence
and
abash
,
and
make
face
at
each
other
,
while
the
physician
,
who
hate
them
both
,
exult
over
their
affliction
,
bid
them
be
of
good
chear
,
and
proceed
with
their
meal
;
for
he
be
ready
to
demonstrate
,
that
the
flesh
of
a
cat
be
as
nourish
and
delicious
as
veal
or
mutton
,
provide
they
could
prove
,
that
the
say
cat
be
not
of
the
boar
-
kind
,
and
have
feed
chiefly
on
vegetable
diet
,
or
even
confine
its
carnivorous
appetite
to
rat
and
mouse
,
which
he
affirm
to
be
dainty
of
exquisite
taste
and
flavour
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
it
be
a
vulgar
mistake
to
think
that
all
flesh
-
deavoure
creature
be
unfit
to
be
eat
;
witness
the
consumption
of
swine
and
duck
,
animal
that
delight
in
carnage
,
as
well
as
fish
,
that
prey
upon
each
other
,
and
feed
on
bait
and
carrion
;
together
with
the
demand
for
bear
,
of
which
the
good
ham
in
the
world
be
make
.
<EOS>
He
then
observe
,
that
the
Negroes
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
who
be
a
healthy
and
vigorous
people
,
prefer
cat
and
dog
to
all
other
fare
;
and
mention
from
history
several
siege
,
during
which
the
inhabitant
,
who
be
block
up
,
live
upon
these
animal
,
and
have
recourse
even
to
human
flesh
,
which
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
be
in
all
respect
preferable
to
pork
;
for
,
in
the
course
of
his
study
,
he
have
,
for
the
experiment
's
sake
,
eat
a
steak
cut
from
the
buttock
of
a
person
who
have
be
hang
.
    
<EOS>
this
dissertation
,
far
from
compose
,
increase
the
disquiet
in
the
stomach
of
the
governor
and
painter
,
who
hear
the
last
illustration
,
turn
their
eye
upon
the
orator
,
at
the
same
instant
,
with
look
of
horror
and
disgust
;
and
the
one
mutter
the
term
Cannibal
,
and
the
other
pronounce
the
word
abomination
,
they
rise
from
table
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
run
towards
another
apartment
,
justle
with
such
violence
in
the
passage
,
that
both
be
overturn
by
the
shock
,
which
also
contribute
to
the
effect
of
their
nausea

that
mutually
defile
them

Chapter

<EOS>
though
Pickle
enjoy
their
disaster
,
he
be
resolve
to
practise
some
invention
upon
the
doctor
,
that
he
may
not
triumph
in
his
revenge
with
impunity
;
and
thus
determine
,
when
Pallet
have
overcome
the
malady
of
his
own
imagination
,
he
impart
to
him
a
plan
of
reprizal
,
which
agreeably
flatter
his
resentment
,
and
be
execute
in
this
manner
:
as
the
painter
and
physician
lie
in
separate
bed
in
the
same
chamber
,
the
former
watch
,
till
by
the
other
's
snore
he
be
certify
of

be
fast
asleep
;
then
move
softly
to
the
door
,
where
Pipes
stand
ready
furnish
for
the
purpose
,
take
a
tea
-
kettle
full
of
warm
water
,
and
cautiously
convey
the
spout
under
the
cloath
of
the
doctor
's
bed
,
pour
in
the
liquor
,
imperceptibly
,
to
the
quantity
of
half
a
gallon
,
and
then
retire
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
have
undertake
to
rouze
his
fellow
-
traveller
in
the
morning
,
enter
the
doctor
's
apartment
with
the
dawn
,
and
wake
them
both
with
the
same
hollow
.
<EOS>
the
painter
immediately
spring
out
of
bed
;
but
the
physician
,
find
himself
drench
from
head
to
foot
,
be
equally
astonished
and
ashamed
,
never
doubt
that
he
have
unfortunately
bedew
himself
in
his
sleep
.
    
<EOS>
this
mistake
he
think
so
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
his
character
,
that
he
durst
not
venture
to
disclose
his
condition
,
especially
as
he
well
know
how
eagerly
the
company
would
seize
such
an
occasion
of
make
merry
at
his
expence
;
and
it
would
be
impracticable
to
conceal
it
from
their
knowledge
,
if
he
should
be
oblige
to
get
up
in
their

:
he
therefore
lie
still
in
the
utmost
perplexity
and
tribulation
,
while
his
two
companion
,
guess
his
thought
,
and
rejoice
at
his
anxiety
,
sit
down
by
his
bedside
,
and
exhort
him
to
rise
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
,
that
have
sweat
profusely
all
night

he
could
not
,
with
any
regard
to
his
health
,
get
up
,
until
he
should
be
shift
,
and
the
pore
of
his
skin
regularly
closed
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
desire
they
would
take
the
trouble
of
see
the
horse
put
to
the
chaise
,
and
the
reckon
adjust
;
assure
them
,
he
should
be
ready
to
attend
them
before
their
business
could
be
dispatch
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
give
him
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Jolter
have
charge
himself
with
the
payment
of
the
bill
,
and
the

be
now
employ
about

so
that

he
therefore
ring
the
bell
for
his
footman
,
and
bade
him
bring
a
clean
shirt
for
his
master
with
all
possible
speed
.

Ere
<EOS>
the

return
,
it
be
broad
day
;
and
a
message
come
from
the

import
that

<EOS>
the

confusion
increase

he
be
torture
by
the

importunity
of

and
moreover

<EOS>
at

Peregrine

take
the

the

"
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
order
to
compleat
the
physician

overthrow
,
shut
up
his
nostril
with
his
finger

thumb

and
ask
in
a
snuffling
tone
,
if
he

that
infirmity

<EOS>
unspeakable
be
the
shame
and
vexation
of

he
be

torment
with
all
the
pang
which
mortify
vanity
can
feel

and
agitate
by
all
the
fury
of
resentment
against
the
person
who
have
detect
his
disgrace

and
who
have
thus
insult
him
in
his
distress

quit
the

leave
him
to

<EOS>
nor

the

who

abstain
from
certain
ill

from

<EOS>
he
desire
to
keep
it
conceal

so
that
he
remain
sullen
and
deject
during

whole
journey
:
not
but
that
he
attempt
to
recover
his
importance
,
by
harangue
upon
the
roman
highway
,
when
Mr
Jolter
desire
the
company
to
take
notice
of
the
fine
pavement
upon
which
they
travel
from
Paris
into
flander
;
but
Pallet
,
who
think
he
have
now
gain
the
ascendency
over
the
physician
,
exert
himself
in
maintain
the
superiority
he
have
acquire
,
by
vent
various
sarcasm
upon
his
self
-
conceit
and
affectation
of
learning
,
and
even
uttering
pun
and
conundrum
upon
the
remark
which
the
republican
retail
.
<EOS>
when
he
talk
of
the
Flaminian
Way
,
the
painter
question
if
it
be
a
well
pavement
than
the
fleminian
way
on
which
they
travel
:
and
the
doctor
have
observe
,
that
this
road
be
make
for
the
convenience
of
draw
the
french
artillery
into
flander
,
which
be
often
the
seat
of
war
;
his
competitor
in
wit
reply
with
infinite
vivacity
,
"
there
be
more
great
gun
than
the
french
king
know
of
draw
along
this
causeway
,
doctor
.
"
    
<EOS>
encourage
by
the
success
of
these
effort
,
which
tickle
the
imagination
of

and
draw
smile
(
as
he
imagine
)
of
approbation
from
our
hero
,
he
sport
in
many
other
aequivoque
of
the
same
nature
;
and
at
dinner
tell
the
physician
,
that
he
be
like
the
root
of
the
tongue
,
as
be
cursedly
down
in
the
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
by
this

such
be
the
animosity
subsist
between
these
quondam
friend

that
they
never
converse
together
,
except
with
a
view
of
expose
each
other
to
the
ridicule
or
contempt
of
their
fellow

traveller

<EOS>
the
doctor
be
at
great
pain
to
point
out
the
folly
and
ignorance
of
Pallet
in
private
to
Peregrine
,
who
be
often
conjure
in
the
same
manner
by
the
painter
,
to
take
notice
of
the
physician
's
want
of
manner
and
taste
.
<EOS>
Pickle
pretend
to
acquiesce
in
the
truth
of
their
mutual
severity

which
indeed
be
extremely
just
,
and
by
malicious
insinuation
blow
up
their
contention
,
with
a
view
of
bring
it
to
open

both
seem
so
averse
to
deed
of
mortal
purpose
,
that
for
a
long
time
his
art
be
baffle
,
and
he
could
not
spirit
them
up
to
any
pitch
of
resentment
high
than
scurrilous
repartee
.
    
<EOS>
before
they
reach
Arras
,
the
city
-
gate
be
shut
,
so
that
they
be
oblige
to
take
up
their
lodging
at
an
indifferent
house
in
the
suburb

where
they
find
a
couple
of
french
officer
,
who
have
also
ride
post
from
Paris
,
so
far
on
their
way
to
Lisle

these

be

their
deportment
distinguish
by
such
an
air
of
insolence

as
disgusted
our

who
,
nevertheless
,
accost
them
politely
in
the
yard
,
and
propose
that
they
should
sup
together
.
<EOS>
They
thank
him
for
the
honour
of
his
invitation
,
which
,
however

they
decline
,
upon
pretence
of
have
order
something
for
themselves
;
but
promise
to
wait
upon
him
and
his
company
immediately
after
their
repast
.
    
<EOS>
this
they
accordingly
perform
;
and
after
have
drink
a
few
glass
of
Burgundy
,
one
of
them
ask
,
if
the
young

would
,
for
pastime

at
quadrille

<EOS>
Peregrine
easily
divine
the
meaning
of
this
proposal
,
which
be
make
with
no
other
view
than
that
of
fleece
him
and
his
fellow
-
traveller
;
for
he
well
know
to
what
shift
<EOS>
a
subaltern
in
the
french
service
be
reduce
,
in
order
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
,
and
have
reason
to
believe
that
most
of
them
be
sharper
from
their
youth
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
depend
a
good
deal
upon
his
own
penetration
and
address
,
he
gratify
the
stranger
's
desire
;
and
a
party
be
instantly
form
of
the
painter
,
the
physician
,
the
proposer
and
himself
,
the
other
officer
have
profess
himself
utterly
ignorant
of
the
game
;
yet
,
in
the
course
of
the
play
,
he
take
his
station
at
the
back
of
Pickle
's
chair
,
which
be
opposite
to
his
friend
,
on
pretence
of
himself
with
see
his
manner
of
conduct
the
card
.
<EOS>
the
youth
be
not
such
a
novice
but
that
he
perceive
the
design
of
this
palpable
piece
of
behaviour
,
which
,
notwithstanding
,
he
overlook'd
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
with
a
view
of
flatter
their
hope
in
the
beginning
,
that
they
may
be
the
more
effectually
punish
,
by
their
disappointment
in
the
end
.
    
<EOS>
the
game
be
scarce
begin
,
when
by
the
reflection
of
a
glass
he
discern
the
officer
at
his
back
,
make
sign
to
his
companion
,
who
,
by
these
pre
-
concerted
gesture
,
be
perfectly
inform
of
the
content
of
Peregrine
's
hand
,
and
of
consequence
fortunate
in
the
course
of
play
.
    
<EOS>
thus
they
be
allow
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
dexterity
,
until
their
money
amount
to
some
Loui
's
;
when
our
young
gentleman
,
think
it
high
time
to
do
himself
justice
,
signify
in
very
polite
term
to
the
gentleman
who
stand
behind
him
,
that
he
could
never
play
with
ease
and
deliberation
when
he
be
overlook
by
any
by
-
stander
,
and
begg'd
that
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
be
seat
.
    
<EOS>
as
this
be
a
remonstrance
which
the
stranger
could
not
with
any
shew
of
breeding
resist
,
he
ask
pardon
,
and
retire
to
the
chair
of
the
physician
,
who
frankly
tell
him
,
that
it
be
not
the
fashion
of
his
country
for
one
to
submit
his
hand
to
the
perusal
of
a
spectator
;
and
when
,
in
consequence
of
this
rebuff
,
he
want
to
quarter
himself
upon
the
painter
,
he
be
refuse
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
,
and
a
shake
of
the
head
,
with
an
exclamation
of
,
Pardonnez
moi
!
<EOS>
which
be
repeat
with
such
emphasis
,
as
discompose
his
effrontery
,
and
he
find
himself
oblige
to
sit
down
in
a
state
of
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
the
odd
be
thus
remove
,
fortune
proceed
in
her
usual
channel
;
and
though
the
Frenchman
,
deprive
of
his
ally
,
endeavour
to
practise
diver
stroke
of
finesse
,
the
rest
of
the
company
observe
him
with
such
vigilance
and
caution
,
as
baffle
all
his
attempt
,
and
in
a
very
little
time
he
be
compel
to
part
with
his
winning
:
but
have
engage
in
the
match
with
an
intention
of
take
all
advantage
,
whether
fair
or
unfair
,
that
his
superior
skill
should
give
him
over
the
Englishmen
,
the
money
be
not
refund
without
a
thousand
dispute
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
essay
to
intimidate
his
antagonist
with
high
word
,
which
be
retort
by
our
hero
with
such
interest
,
as
convince
him
that
he
have
mistake
his
man
,
and
persuade
him
to
make
his
retreat
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
not
without
cause
that
they
repine
at
the
bad
success
of
their
enterprize
;
because
,
in
all
likelihood
,
they
have
nothing
to
depend
upon
for
the
present
but
their
own
industry
,
and
know
not
how
to
defray
their
expence
on
the
road
,
except
by
some
acquisition
of
this
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
they
rise
at
day

break
,
and
resolve
to
anticipate
their
fellow

lodger
,
bespoke
post

as
soon
as
they
could
be
admit
into
the
city
;
so
that
when
our
company
appear
,
their
beast
be
ready
in
the
yard
;
and
they
only
wait
to
discuss
the
bill
,
which
they
have
order
to
be
make
out
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
of
the
inn
present
his
carte
with
fear
and
tremble
to
one
of
those
ferocious
cavalier
,
who
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
upon
the
sum
total
,
than
he
discharge
a
volley
of
dreadful
oath
,
and
ask
if
the
king

officer
be
to
be
treat
in
that
manner
.
    
<EOS>
the
poor
publican

with
great
humility
,
that
he
have
the
utmost
respect
for
his
majesty
,
and
every
thing
that
belong
to
him
;
and
that
,
far
from
consult
his
own
interest
,
all
that
he
desire
be
,
to
be
barely
indemnify
for
the
expence
of
their
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
this
condescension
seem
to
have
no
other
effect
than
that
of
encourage
their
arrogance
.
<EOS>
They
swear
his
extortion
should
be
explain
to
the
commandant
of
the
town
,
who
would
,
by
make
him
a
public
example
,
teach
other
inn
-
keepers
how
to
behave
towards
man
of
honour
;
and
threaten
with
such
confidence
of
indignation
,
that
the
wretched
landlord
,
dread
the
consequence
of
their
wrath
,
implore
pardon
in
the
most
abject
manner
,
beg
with
many
supplication
,
that
he
may
have
the
pleasure
of
lodge
them
at
his
own
charge
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
favour
<EOS>
which
he
with
great
difficulty
obtain
;
they
chid
him
severely
for
his
imposition
,
exhort
him
to
have
more
regard
for
his
own
conscience
,
as
well
as
for
the
convenience
of
his
guest
;
and
caution
him

touch
his
behaviour
to
the

mount
their

and
ride
off

leave
him
very
thankful
for

so
successfully
appease
the
choler
of
two
officer
,
who
want
either
inclination
or
ability
to

<EOS>
:
for
experience
have
teach
him
to
be
apprehensive
of
all
such
traveller

who
commonly
lie
the

under
contribution
,
by
way
of
atonement
for
the
extravagance

Our

that

a

misrepresent

which
in

never

to
punish
flagrant

which

tell

that

they

,
after

the

unfortunately
ask
the

of

answer
by

describe
the
nature
of
this
expedient
so
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
officer
,
that
he
contradict
him
flatly
,
in
the
midst
of
his
explanation
;
a
circumstance
which
provoke
the
republican
to
such
a
degree
,
that
in
the
temerity
of
his
passion
,
he
utter
the
epithet
impertinent
scoundrel

no

pronounce
than
the
Caledonian
make
manual
application

nose

and
leap
out

make
feeble

knight
of

,
in
a
conversation
upon
the
english
stage
,
which
be

by
a
dissertation
on
the
theatre
of

by

together
with
some
remarkable
church
,
they
,
in
their
return
,
go
to
the
comedy
,
and
see
the
Cid
of
Corneille
tolerably
well
represent
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
entertainment
,
the
discourse
at
supper
turn
upon
dramatic
performance
;
and
all
the
objection
of
Mons

Scudery
to
the
piece
they
have
see
act
,
together
with
the
decision
of
the
french
academy
,
be
canvass
and
discuss
.
<EOS>
the
knight
be
a
man
of
letter
and
taste
,
and
particularly
well
acquaint
with
the
state
of
the
english
stage
;
so
that
when
the
painter
boldly
pronounce
sentence
against
the
french
manner
of
acting
,
on
the
strength
of
have
frequent
a
Covent
-
Garden
club
of
critick
,
and
be
often
admit
by
virtue
of
an
order
,
into
the
pit
;
a
comparison
immediately
ensue
,
not
between
the
author
,
but
the
actor
of
both
nation
,
to
whom
the
chevalier
and
Peregrine
be
no
stranger
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
like
a
good
Englishman
,
make
no
scruple
of
give
the
preference
to
the
performer
of
his
own
country
,
who
,
he
alledge
,
obey
the
genuine
impulse
of
nature
,
in
exhibit
the
passion
of
the
human
mind
;
and
enter
so
warmly
into
the
spirit
of
their
several
part
,
that
they
often
fancy
themselves
the
very
hero
they
represent
.
    
<EOS>
Whereas
,
the
action
of
the
parisian
player
,
even
in
their
most
interesting
character
,
be
generally
such
an
extravagance
in
voice
and
gesture
,
as
be
no
where
to
be
observe
<EOS>
but
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
to
illustrate
this
assertion
,
he
avail
himself
of
his
talent
,
and
mimic
the
manner
and
voice
of
all
the
principal
performer
,
male
and
female
,
belong
to
the
french
comedy
;
to
the
admiration
of
the
chevalier
,
who
have
compliment
him
upon
this
surprising
modulation
,
beg
leave
to
dissent
in
some
particular
from
the
opinion
he
have
avow
.
<EOS>
"
that
you
have
good
actor
in
England
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
it
would
be
unjust
and
absurd
in
me
to
deny
;
your
theatre
be
adorn
by
one
woman
,
whose
sensibility
and
sweetness
of
voice
be
such
as
I
have
never
observe
on
any
other
stage
;
she
have
,
besides
,
an
elegance
of
person
and
expression
of
feature
,
that
wonderfully
adapt
her
for
the
most
engaging
character
of
your
good
play
;
and
I
must
freely
own
that
I
have
be
as
highly
delighted
,
and
as
deeply
affected
,
by
a
Monimia
and
Belvidera
at
London
,
as
ever
I
be
by
a
Cornelia
and
Cleopatra
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
You
can
,
moreover
,
boast
of
several
comic
actor
who
be
perfect
master
of
buffoonery
and
grimace
;
though
,
to
be
free
with
you
,
I
think
,
in
these
qualification
you
be
excel
by
the
player
of
Amsterdam
:
neither
be
you
destitute
of
those
,
who
,
with
a
good
deal
of
cultivation
,
may
acquire
some
degree
of
excellence
in
the
representation
of
tragic
character
:
but
I
shall
never
cease
to
wonder
that
the
English
,
who
be
certainly
a
sensible
and
discern
people
should
be
so
much
infatuate
,
as
to
applaud
and
caress
with
the
most
extravagant
approbation
,
not
to
say
adoration
and
regard
,
one
or
two
gracioso
's
,
who
,
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
would
scarce
be
able
to
earn
their
bread
by
their
talent
,
on
any
other
theatre
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
one
of
these
,
in
the
celebrated
part
of
Richard
the
third
,
which
,
I
believe
,
be
not
a
character
of
ridicule
,
sollicit
and
triumph
in
the
laugh
of
the
audience
,
during
the
good
part
of
a
scene
in
which
the
author
have
represent
that
prince
as
an
object
of
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
the
same
person
in
the
character
of
Hamlet
,
shake
his
fist
with
all
the
demonstration
of
wrath
at
his
mistress
,
for
no
evident
cause
,
and
behave
like
a
ruffian
to
his
own
mother
.
<EOS>
shock
at
such
want
of
dignity
and
decorum
in
a
prince
,
who
seem
the
favourite
of
the
people
,
I
condemn
the
genius
that
produce
him
,
but
,
upon
a
second
perusal
of
the
play
,
transfer
my
censure
to
the
actor
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
have
egregiously
mistake
the
meaning
of
the
poet
.
<EOS>
at
a
juncture
,
when
his
whole
soul
ought
to
be
alarm
with
terror
and
amazement
,
and
all
his
attention
engross
by
the
dreadful
object
in
view
,
I
mean
that
of
his
friend
whom
he
have
murthere
;
he
express
no
passion
but
that
of
indignation
against
a
drinking
glass
,
which
he
violently
dash
in
piece
on
the
floor
,
as
if
he
have
perceive
a
spider
in
his
wine
;
nay
,
while
his
eye
be
fix
upon
the
ground
,
he
start
at
the
image
of
a
dagger
which
he
pretend
to
see
above
his
head
,
as
if
the
pavement
be
a
looking
-
glass
that
represent
it
by
reflexion
:
and
at
one
time
,
I
see
him
walk
a
-
cross
the
stage
,
and
lend
an
inferior
character
a
box
on
the
ear
,
after
he
have
with
great
wrath
pronounce
<EOS>
"
take
thou
that
,
"
or
some
equivalent
exclamation
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
scene
.
    
<EOS>
He
represent
the
grief
of
an
hero
,
by
the
tear
and
manner
of
a
whine
school
-
boy
,
and
pervert
the
genteel
deportment
of
a
gentleman
,
into
the
idle
buffoonery
of
a
miserable
tobacconist
;
his
whole
art
be
no
other
than
a
succession
of
frantic
vociferation
,
such
as
I
have
hear
in
the
cell
of
Bedlam
,
a
slowness
,
hesitation
and
oppression
of
speech
,
as
if
he
be
trouble
with
an
asthma
,
convulsive
starting
,
and
a
ductility
of
feature
,
suit
to
the
most
extravagant
transition
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
be
bless
with
a
distinct
voice
,
and
a
great
share
of
vivacity
;
but
in
point
of
feeling
,
judgment
,
and
grace
,
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
altogether
defective
.
<EOS>
not
to
mention
his
impropriety
in
dress
,
which
be
so
absurd
,
that
he
act
the
part
of
a
youthful
prince
,
in
the
habit
of
an
undertaker
,
and
exhibit
the
gay
,
fashionable
Lothario
,
in
the
appearance
of
a
mountebank
.
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
treat
this
darling
of
the
English
with
so
little
ceremony
;
and
to
convince
you
of
my
candour
,
frankly
confess
,
that
notwithstanding
all
I
have
say
,
he
be
qualified
to
make
a
considerable
figure
in
the
low
character
of
humour
,
which
be
so
much
relish
by
a
London
audience
,
if
he
could
be
prevail
upon
to
abate
of
that
monstrous
burlesque
,
which
be
an
outrage
against
nature
and
common
sense
.
<EOS>
as
for
his
competitor
in
fame
,
with
an
equal
share
of
capacity
,
he
be
inferior
to
him
in
personal
agility
,
sprightliness
and
voice
.
<EOS>
His
utterance
be
a
continual
sing
song
,
like
the
chant
of
vesper
,
and
his
action
resemble
that
of
heave
ballast
into
the
hold
of
a
ship
.
    
<EOS>
in
his
outward
deportment
,
he
seem
to
have
confound
the
idea
of
dignity
and
insolence
of
mien
,
act
the
crafty
,
cool
,
design
Crookback
,
as
a
loud
,
shallow
,
bluster
Hector
;
in
the
character
of
the
mild
patriot
Brutus
,
lose
all
temper
and
decorum
;
nay
,
so
ridiculous
be
the
behaviour
of
him
and
Cassius
at
their
interview
,
that
set
foot
to
foot
,
and
grin
at
each
other
,
with
the
aspect
of
two
cobler
enrage
,
they
thrust
their
left
side
together
,
with
repeat
shock
,
that
the
hilt
of
their
sword
may
clash
for
the
entertainment
of
the
audience
;
as
if
they
be
a
couple
of
Merry
Andrews
,
endeavour
to
raise
the
laugh
of
the
vulgar
,
on
some
scaffold
at
Bartholomew
Fair
.
<EOS>
the
despair
of
a
great
man
who
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
infernal
practice
of
a
subtle
traitor
,
that
enjoy
his
confidence
,
this
English
Aesopus
represent
,
by
beat
his
own
forehead
,
and
bellowing
like
a
bull
;
and
indeed
,
in
almost
all
his
most
interesting
scene
,
perform
such
strange
shaking
of
the
head
,
and
other
antic
gesticulation
,
that
when
I
first
see
him
act
,
I
imagine
the
poor
man
labour
under
that
paralytical
disorder
,
which
be
know
by
the
name
of
St
Vitus
's
dance
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
seem
to
be
a
stranger
to
the
more
refined
sensation
of
the
soul
,
consequently
his
expression
be
of
the
vulgar
kind
,
and
he
must
often
sink
under
the
idea
of
the
poet
;
so
that
he
have
recourse
to
such
violence
of
affected
agitation
,
as
impose
upon
the
undiscerning
spectator
,
but
to
the
eye
of
taste
,
evince
him
a
meer
player
of
that
class
whom
your
admire
Shakespear
justly
compare
to
nature
's
journeyman
tear
a
passion
to
rag
.
    
<EOS>
yet
this
man
,
in
spite
of
all
these
absurdity
,
be
an
admirable
Falstaff
,
exhibit
the
character
of
the
eighth
Henry
to
the
life
,
be
reasonably
applaud
in
the
Plain
Dealer
,
excel
in
the
part
of
Sir
John
Brute
,
and
would
be
equal
to
many
humorous
situation
in
low
comedy
,
which
his
pride
will
not
allow
him
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
be
so
severe
upon
these
rival
,
have
not
I
see
them
extoll
by
their
partizan
,
with
the
most
ridiculous
and
fulsome
manifestation
of
praise
,
even
in
those
very
circumstance
wherein
(
as
I
have
observe
)
<EOS>
they
chiefly
fail
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
not
a
little
pique
to
hear
the
qualification
of
the
two
most
celebrated
actor
in
England
treat
with
such
freedom
and
disrespect
,
answer
with
some
asperity
,
that
the

be
a
true
critick
,
more
industrious
in
observe
the
blemish
than
in
acknowledge
the
excellence
of
those
who
fall
under
his
examination
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
one
actor
could
shine
equally
in
all
character
;
and
though
his
observation
be
undoubtedly
very
judicious
,
he
himself
could
not
help
wonder
that
some
of
them
have
always
escape
his
notice

he
have
be

assiduous
frequenter
of

playhouse

"
the
two

in
question

say
he

have
,
in
your
own
opinion

a
considerable
share
of
merit
in

comic
life

manner

age
,
when
they
see
any
man
perform
unnecessary
gesture
,
say
he
be
either
a
fool
or
a
Frenchman
.
<EOS>
the
standard
of
demeanour
be
thus
unsettle
,
a
Turk
,
a
Moor
,
an
Indian
,
or
inhabitant
of
any
country
,
whose
custom
and
dress
be
widely
different
from
our
,
may
in
his
sentiment
,
possess
all
the
dignity
of
the
human
heart
,
and
be
inspire
by
the
noblest
passion
that
animate
the
soul
,
and
yet
excite
the
laughter
rather
than
the
respect
of
an
european
spectator
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
first
beheld
your
famous
parisian
stage
-
heroine
,
in
one
of
her
principal
part
,
her
attitude
seem
so
violent
,
and
she
toss
her
arm
around
with
such
extravagance
,
that
she
put
me
in
mind
of
a
windmill
under
the
agitation
of
a
hard
gale
;
while
her
voice
and
feature
exhibit
the
lively
representation
of
an
English
scold
.
<EOS>
the
action
of
your
favourite
male
-
performer
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
equally
unnatural
;
he
appear
with
the
affected
air
of
a
dancing
-
master
;
at
the
most
pathetic
juncture
of
his
fate
,
he
lift
up
his
hand
above
his
head
,
like
a
tumbler
go
to
vault
,
and
speak
as
if
his
throat
have
be
obstruct
by
an
hair
-
brush
;
yet
,
when
I
compare
their
manner
with
those
of
the
people
before
whom
they
perform
,
and
make
allowance
for
that
exaggeration
which
obtain
on
all
theatre
,
I
be
insensibly
reconcile
to
their
method
of
performance
,
and
could
distinguish
abundance
of
merit
beneath
that
oddity
of
appearance
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
chevalier
perceive
Peregrine
a
little
irritated
at
what
he
have
say
,
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
have
take
,
in
censure
the
english
player
,
assure
him
that
he
have
an
infinite
veneration
for
the
british
learning
,
genius
and
taste
,
which
be
so
justly
distinguish
in
the
world
of
letter
;
and
that
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
his
criticism
,
he
think
the
theatre
of
London
much
better
supply
with
actor
than
that
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
thank
him
for
his
polite
condescension
,
at
which
Pallet
exult
,
say
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
"
I
believe
so
too
,
Monsieur
;
"
and
the
physician
,
impatient
of
the
dispute
in
which
he
have
bear
no
share
,
observe
with
a
supercilious
air
,
that
the
modern
stage
be
altogether
beneath
the
notice
of
one
who
have
an
idea
of
ancient
magnificence
and
execution
;
that
play
ought
to
be
exhibit
at
the
expence
of
the
state
,
as
those
of
Sophocles
be
by
the
Athenians
;
and
that
proper
judge
should
be
appoint
for
receive
or
reject
all
such
performance
as
be
offer
to
the
public
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
describe
the
theatre
at
Rome
,
which
contain
eighty
thousand
spectator
,
give
them
a
learn
disquisition
into
the
nature
of
the
Persona
,
or
mask
,
wear
by
the
roman
actor
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
a
machine
that
cover
the
whole
head
,
furnish
on
the
inside
with
a
brazen
concavity
,
that
,
by
reverberate
the
sound
as
it
issue
from
the
mouth
,
raise
the
voice
,
so
as
to
render
it
audible
to
such
an
extended
audience
.
    
<EOS>
He
explain
the
difference
between
the
Saltator
and
Declamator
,
one
of
whom
act
,
while
the
other
rehearse
the
part
;
and
from
thence
take
occasion
to
mention
the
perfection
of
their
pantomime
,
who
be
so
amazingly
distinct
in
the
exercise
of
their
art
,
that
a
certain
prince
of
Pontus
be
at
the
court
of
Nero
,
and
see
one
of
them
represent
a
story
,
beg
him
of
the
emperor
,
in
order
to
employ
him
as
an
interpreter
among
barbarous
nation
,
whose
language
he
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
nay
,
diver
cynic
philosopher
,
who
have
condemn
this
entertainment
unseen
,
when
they
chance
to
be
eye
-
witness
of
their
admirable
dexterity
,
express
their
sorrow
for
have
so
long
debar
themselves
of
such
rational
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
He
dissent
,
however
,
from
the
opinion
of
Peregrine
,
who
,
as
a
proof
of
their
excellence
,
have
advance
,
that
some
of
the
english
actor
fancy
themselves
the
very
thing
they
represent
,
and
recount
a
story
from
Lucian
,
of
a
certain
celebrated
pantomime
,
who
in
act
the
part
of
Ajax
in
his
frenzy
,
be
transport
into
a
real
fit
of
delirium
,
during
which
he
tear
to
-
piece
the
cloath
of
that
actor
who
stalk
before
him
,
beat
the
stage
with
iron
shoe
,
in
order
to
increase
the
noise
,
snatch
an
instrument
from
one
of
the
musician
,
and
break
it
over
the
head
of
him
who
represent
ulysse
;
and
run
to
the
consular
bench
,
mistake
a
couple
of
senator
for
the
sheep
which
be
to
be
slay
.
<EOS>
the
audience
applaud
him
to
the
sky
;
but
so
conscious
be
the
mimic
of
his
own
extravagance
,
when
he
recover
the
use
of
his
reason
,
that
he
actually
fall
sick
with
mortification
;
and
be
afterwards
desire
to
re
-
act
the
piece
,
flatly
refuse
to
appear
in
any
such
character
,
say
,
that
the
short
folly
be
the
good
,
and
that
it
be
sufficient
for
him
to
have
be
a
madman
once
in
his
life

<EOS>
Pipes
be
question
by

with
regard
to
the
truth
of
this
account

own
that
every
circumstance
be
justly
represent
;
say
,
he
do
not
value
their
cheese

toaster
a

and
that
if
the

have
not
shoot
in

he
would
have
trim

such
a

his
ask
pardon

<EOS>
but
no
consideration
be
efficacious
enough
to
produce
such
concession
;
to
this
command
he
be
both
deaf
and
dumb
,
and
the
repeat
threat
of
his

have
no
more
effect
than
if

<EOS>
at
length

have
not

prevent
by

give

a

way

<EOS>
the
Knight
perceive
our
young

very
much
ruffle
at
this

reflect
upon
the
extraordinary

appearance
of
his
valet

whose

imagine

who
have
grow
grey
in

he

sacrifice
he

make

<EOS>
sway
by
this
conjecture

he
earnestly
sollicite

all
he
could
obtain

be
a
promise
of
re

admit
him
into

on
the
term
already
propose

or
at

on
condition
that
he
should
make
his
acknowledgment
to
the
Chevalier
,
for
his
want
of
reverence
and
respect
for
the
french
monarch
.
    
<EOS>
upon
this
condescension
,
the
culprit
be
call
up
stair
,
and
make
acquainted
with
the
mitigation
of
his
fate
;
upon
which
he
say
,
he
would
down
on
his
marrow
-
bone
to
his
own
master
,
but
would
be
damn'd
before
he
would
ask
pardon
of
e'er
a
Frenchman
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
exasperate
at
this
blunt
declaration

order
him
out
of
his
presence

charge
him
never

appear
before
his
face
again
;
while
the
officer
in
vain
employ
all
his
influence
and
address
to
appease
his
resentment

about
midnight
take
his

all

it
be
resolve
that
the
valet

attend
the

and
as
for
the
forlorn
Pipes

he
be
leave
to
reap
the
fruit
of
his

stubborn
disposition

notwithstanding
the
united
efforts

procure
his
pardon

six

the
company

female
adventurer

a

a
Capuchin

a
Rotterdam

Our
young

<EOS>
She
,
without
the
least
reserve
or
affectation

thank
him
for
his
compliment

and
reply
with
a
sprightly
air

that
now

common
bottom

they
must
club
their

encourage
by
this
frank
intimation

and
captivate
by
her
fine
black
eye
and
easy
behaviour

he
attach
himself
to
her
from
that
moment
;
and
in
a
little
time
the
conversation
become
so
particular
,
that
the
Capuchin
think
proper
to
interfere
in
the
discourse
,
in
such
a
manner
as
give
the
youth
to
understand
,
that
he
be
there
on
purpose
to
superintend
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
be
doubly
rejoice
at
this
discovery

in
consequence
of
which
he
hope
to
profit
in
his
address

not
only
by
the
young
lady
's
restraint
,
that
never
fail
to
operate
in
behalf
of
the
lover
,
but
also
by
the
corruptibility
of
her
guardian
,
whom
he
do
not
doubt
of
render
propitious
to
his
cause
.
    
<EOS>
flush

uncommon
complacency
to

on
the

his
generosity
abate
of
his
vigilance
so
much
,
that
our
hero
carry
on
his
suit
without
further
molestation
;
while
the
painter

in
sign

loud
burst
of
laughter
,
converse
with
his
Dulcinea
,
who
be
perfectly
well
verse
in
these
simple
expression
of
satisfaction
,
and
have
already
find
mean
to
make
a
dangerous
invasion
upon
his

<EOS>
nor
be
the
governor
and
physician
unemployed

while
their

interest
themselves
in
this
agreeable
manner
.
<EOS>
jolter
no
sooner
perceive
the
Hollander
be
a
Jew
,
than
he
enter
into
an
investigation
of
the
hebrew
tongue
,
in
which
he
be
a
connoisseur
;
and
the
doctor
at
the
same
time
attack
the
Mendicant
on
the
ridiculous
maxim
of
his
order
,
together
with
the
imposition
of
priest

craft
in
general
,
which
(
he
observe
)
prevail
so
much
among
those
who
profess
the
roman
catholic
religion

thus
couple

enjoy
their

without
any
danger
of
encroachment

all

so
intent

scarce

twelve
o'clock
they
arrive
at
Courtray
,
where
the
horse
be
always
,
change
,
and
the
company
halt
an
hour
for
refreshment
.
<EOS>
here
Peregrine
hand
his
charmer
into
an
apartment
,
where
she
be
join
by
the
other
lady
;
and
on
pretence
of
see
some
of
the
church
in
town
,
put
himself
under
the
direction
of
the
Capuchin
,
from
whom
he
learn'd
,
that
the
young
lady
be
wife
to
a
french
gentleman
,
to
whom
she
have
be
marry
about
a
year
,
and
that
she
be
now
on
her
journey
to
visit
her
mother
,
who
live
in
Brussels
,
and
who
at
that
time
labour
under
a
linger
distemper
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
would
soon
put
a
period
to
her
life
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
launch
out
in
praise
of
her
daughter
's
virtue
and
conjugal
affection
;
and
lastly
tell
him
,
that
he
be
her
father
confessor
,
and
pitch
upon
to
be
her
conductor
through
flander
,
by
her
husband
,
who
,
as
well
as
his
wife
,
place
the
utmost
confidence
in
his
prudence
and
integrity
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
easily
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
insinuation
,
and
take
the
hint
accordingly
.
<EOS>
He
tickle
the
priest
's
vanity
with
extraordinary
encomium
upon
the
disinterested
principle
of
his
order
,
which
be
detach
from
all
worldly
pursuit
,
and
altogether
devoted
to
the
eternal
salvation
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
applaud
their
patience
,
humility
and
learning
,
and
lavish
a
world
of
praise
upon
their
talent
in
preaching
,
which
(
he
say
)
have
more
than
once
operate
so
powerfully
upon
him
,
that
have
he
not
be
restrain
by
certain
consideration
which
he
could
not
possibly
wave
,
he
should
have
embrace
their
tenet
,
and
begg'd
admission
into
their
fraternity
;
but
,
as
the
circumstance
of
his
fate
would
not
permit
him
to
take
such
a
salutary
measure
for
the
present
,
he
intreate
the
good
father
to
accept
a
small
token
of
his
love
and
respect
,
for
the
benefit
of
that
convent
to
which
he
belong
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
pull
out
a
purse
of
ten
guinea
,
which
the
Capuchin
observe
,
turn
his
head
another
way
,
and
lift
up
his
arm
,
display
a
pocket
almost
as
high
as
his
collar
-
bone
,
in
which
he
deposit
the
money
.
    
<EOS>
this
proof
of
affection
for
the
order
produce
a
sudden
and
surprising
effect
upon
the
friar
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
transport
of
his
zeal
he
wring
this
semi
-
convert
's
hand
,
shower
a
thousand
benediction
upon
his
head
,
and
exhort
him
,
with
the
tear
flow
from
his
eye
,
to
perfect
the
great
work
which
the
finger
of
God
have
begin
in
his
heart
;
and
as
an
instance
of
his
concern
for
the
welfare
of
his
precious
soul
,
the
holy
brother
promise
to
recommend
him
strenuously
to
the
pious
admonition
of
the
young
woman
under
his
care
,
who
be
a
perfect
saint
upon
earth
,
and
endue
with
the
peculiar
gift
of
mollify
the
heart
of
obdurate
sinner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O

hypocritical
projector

"
<EOS>
have
pronounce
this
rhapsody
with
transport
half
natural
and
half
affected

the

him
,
that
these

He

Jolter
and
a
Jew

appease
the
wrath
of
the
Capuchin

who
procure
for
him
an
interview
with
his
fair
enslaver
,
in
which
he

<EOS>
Peregrine
,
mean
while
,
employ
all
his
insinuation
and
address
in
practise
upon
the
heart
of
the
Capuchin
's
fair
charge
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
ago
declare
his
passion
,
not
in
the
superficial
manner
of
a
french
gallant
,
but
with
all
the
ardor
of
an
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
He
have
languish
,
vow'd
,
flatter
,
<EOS>
kiss'd
<EOS>
her
hand
by
stealth
,
and
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
his
reception
.
    
<EOS>
Though
by
a
man
of
a
less
sanguine
disposition
,
her
particular
complaisance
would
have
be
deem
equivocal
,
and
perhaps
nothing
more
than
the
effect
of
french
breeding
and
constitutional
vivacity
;
he
give
his
own
qualification
credit
for
the
whole
,
and
with
these
sentiment
carry
on
the
attack
with
such
unabating
vigour
,
that
she
be
actually
prevail
upon
to
accept
a
ring
,
which
he
present
as
a
token
of
his
esteem
;
and
every
thing
proceed
in
a
most
prosperous
train
,
when
they

disturb
by
the
governor
and
Israelite
,
who
in
the
heat
of
disputation
raise
their
voice
,
and
pour
forth
such
effusion
of
guttural
,
as
set
our
lover
's
tooth
on
edge
.
<EOS>
as
they
speak
in
a
language
unknown
to
every
one
in
the
carriage
but
themselves
,
and
look
at
each
other
with
mutual
animosity
and
rancour
,
Peregrine
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
their
contention
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
Jolter
exclaim
in
a
furious
tone
,
"
this
learn
Levite
,
forsooth
,
have
the
impudence
to
tell
me
,
that
I
do
not
understand
Hebrew
;
and
affirm
,
that
the
word
Benoni
signify
child
of
joy
;
whereas
I
can
prove

indeed
have
already

<EOS>
have
thus
explain
himself
to
his
pupil
,
he
turn
to
the
priest
,
with
intention
to
appeal
to
his
determination

but
the
Jew
pull
him
by
the
sleeve
with
great
eagerness
,
say
,
"
for
the
love
of

quiet

ecchoe
"

<EOS>
with
great
emphasis

repeat
nos
poma

ask
ironically
,
to
which
of
the

<EOS>
the
Jew
think
he
belong
?
<EOS>
the
Levite
,
affront
at
his
compare
him
to
a
ball
of
horse
-
dung
,
reply
with
a
most
significant
grin
,
"
to
the
tribe
of
Issachar
.
"
    
<EOS>
and
his
antagonist
,
take
the
advantage
of
his
unwillingness
to
be
know
by
the
friar
,
and
prompt
by
revenge
for
the
freedom
he
have
use
,
answer
in
the
french
language
,
that
the
judgment
of
God
be
still
manifest
upon
their
whole
race
,
not
only
in
their
being
in
the
state
of
exile
from
their
native
land
,
but
also
in
the
spite
of
their
heart
and
pravity
of
their
disposition
,
which
demonstrate
them
to
be
the
genuine
offspring
of
those
who
crucify
the
Saviour
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
His
expectation
be
,
however
,
defeat
;
the
priest
himself
be
too
deeply
engaged
,
to
attend
to
the
debate
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
the
physician
,
in
the
pride
and
insolence
of
his
learning
,
have
undertake
to
display
the
absurdity
of
the
christian
faith
;
have
already
(
as
he
think
)
confute
the
Capuchin
,
touch
the
point
of
belief
in
which
the
Roman
Catholics
differ
from
the
rest
of
the
world

<EOS>
but
,
not
content
with
the
imagine
victory
he
have
gain
,
he
begin
to
strike
at
the
fundamental
of
religion
;
and
the
father
,
with
incredible
forbearance
,
suffer
him
to
make
very
free
with
the
doctrine
of
the
Trinity
:
but
,
when
he
level
the
shaft
of
his
ridicule
at
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
Blessed
Virgin

the
good

patience
forsook
him

his

in

with

"
You

I

an
information
against

at
length

in
consideration
of
the
friendship
he
profess
for
the
young

consent
to
forgive
what

absolutely
refuse

such
a
profane
wretch

a
fiend
of
darkness

send

the
enemy

to
poison
the

after

throw
himself
at

foot

beg
she
would
spare
him
the
tedious
form
of
address
,
which
the
nature

interview
would
not
permit

to
observe

begin
with
all
the
impetuosity

<EOS>
but
,
whether
she
be
displease
at
the
intrepidity

assurance

his
behaviour
,
think
herself
intitle
to
more
courtship
and
respect

or
be
really
better
fortify
with
chastity
than
he

his
procurer
have
suppose
her

certain
it
be
,
she
express
resentment
and
surprize
at
his
boldness
and
presumption
,
and
upbraid
him
with
have
impose
upon

charity
of
the

<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
be
really
as
much
astonish
at
this
rebuff
,
as
she
pretend
to
be
at
his
declaration
,
and
earnestly
intreate
her
to
consider
how
precious
the
moment
be

and
for
once
sacrifice
superfluous
ceremony

to
the
happiness
of
one

adore
her

such
a

yet

notwithstanding
all

his
personal

all

make
an
impression

heart

which
she
hope
the
dictate
of
her
duty
would
enable
her
to
erase
.
<EOS>
this
confession
he
consider
as
a
delicate
consent

and
obey
the
impulse
of
his
love
,
snatch
her
up
in
his
arm

with
intention
of
seize
that

the
Capuchin
,
set
his
shoulder
to
the
door

burst
it
open
,
and
enter
in
an
affected
extasy
of
amazement
.
<EOS>
He
lift
up
his
hand
and
eye
,
and
pretend
to
be
thunderstruck
at
the
discovery
he
have
make
;
then
,
in
broken
exclamation
,
profess
his
horror
at
the
wicked
intention
of
our
hero
,
who
have
cover
such
a
damnable
scheme
with
the
mask
of
religion
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
perform
his
cue
with
such
dexterity
,
that
the
lady
believe
him
in
earnest
,
begg'd
he
would
forgive
the
stranger
,
on
account
of
his
youth
and
education
,
which
have
be
taint
by
the
error
of
heresy
;
and
he
be
on
these
consideration
content
to
accept
the
submission
of
our
hero
,
who
,
far
from
renounce
his
expectation
,
notwithstanding
this
mortifying
repulse
,
confide
so
much
in
his
own
talent
,
and
the
confession
which
his
mistress
have
make
,
that
he
resolve
to
make
another
effort
,
to
which
nothing
could
have
prompt
him
but
the
utmost
turbulence
of
unruly
desire

LVIII
<EOS>
He
make
another
effort
towards
the
accomplishment
of
his
wish
,
which
be
postpone
by
a
strange
accident
.
   
<EOS>
He
direct
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
be
a
thorough
-
pace
pimp
,
to
kindle
some
straw
in
the
yard
,
and
then
pass
by
the
door
of
her
apartment
,
cry
with
a
loud
voice
that
the
house
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
this
alarm
bring
both
lady
out
of
their
chamber
in
a
moment
,
and
Peregrine
take
the
advantage
of
their
run
to
the
street
door
,
enter
the
room
and
conceal
himself
under
a
large
table
that
stand
in
an
unobserved
corner
.
<EOS>
the
nymph
,
as
soon
as
they
understand
the
cause
of
his
Mercury
's
suppose
affright
,
return
to
their
apartment
,
and
have
say
their
prayer
,
undress
themselves
and
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
this
scene
,
which
fall
under
the
observation
of
Pickle
,
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
cooling
of
his
concupiscence
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
inflame
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
scarce
restrain
his
impatience
,
until
by
her
snoring
,
he
conclude
the
fellow
-
lodger
of
his
Amanda
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
this
welcome
note
no
sooner
salute
his
ear
,
than
he
creep
to
his
charmer
's
bedside
,
and
place
himself
on
his
knee
,
gently
lay
hold
on
her
white
hand
,
and
press
it
to
his
lip
.
    
<EOS>
She
have
just
begin
to
close
her
eye
,
and
enjoy
the
agreeable
oppression
of
slumber
,
when
she
be
rouse
by
this
rape
,
at
which
she
start
,
pronounce
in
a
tone
of
surprize
and
dismay
,
"
My
God
!
<EOS>
who
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
the
lover
,
with
the
most
insinuating
humility
,
besought
her
to
hear
him
;
vow
that
his
intention
in
approach
her
thus
,
be
not
to
violate
the
law
of
decency
,
or
that
indelible
esteem
which
she
have
engraven
on
his
heart
;
but
to
manifest
his
sorrow
and
contrition
for
the
umbrage
he
have
give
,
to
pour
forth
the
overflowing
of
his
soul
,
and
tell
her
that
he
neither
could
nor
would
survive
her
displeasure
.
<EOS>
these
and
many
more
pathetic
protestation
,
accompany
with
sigh
and
tear
,
and
other
expression
of
genuine
grief
,
which
our
hero
have
at
command
,
could
not
fail
to
melt
the
tender
heart
of
the
amiable
Fleming
,
already
prepossess
in
favour
of
his
qualification
.
<EOS>
She
sympathize
so
much
with
his
affliction
,
as
to
weep
in
her
turn
,
when
she
represent
the
impossibility
of
her
reward
his
passion
;
and
he
seize
the
favourable
moment
,
reinforce
his
sollicitation
with
such
irresistible
transport
,
that
her
resolution
give
way
,
she
begin
to
breathe
quick
and
deep
,
express
her
fear
of
be
overhear
by
the
other
lady
,
and
with
an
ejaculation
of
"
o
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
be
undone
:
"
suffer
herself
,
after
a
faint
struggle
,
to
be
overpower
by
her
admirer
,
who
make
a
lodgment
upon
the
covered
way
of
her
bed
,
under
the
curtain
of
the
counterscarp
;
and
in
all
probability
,
would
have
in
a
few
moment
make
himself
master
of
the
place
;
when
her
honour
be
secure
for
the
present
,
by
a
strange
sort
of
knock
upon
the
wainscot
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
hard
by
the
bed
in
which
the
female
adventurer
lie
.
    
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
circumstance
which
interrupt
our
assailant
's
operation
,
the
lady
beg
him
for
heaven
's
sake
to
retreat
,
else
her
reputation
would
be
ruin
for
ever
:
but
when
he
represent
to
her
,
that
her
character
would
run
a
much
great
risk
,
if
he
should
be
detect
in
withdrawing
,
she
consent
with
great
trepidation
to
his
stay
,
and
they
listen
in
silence
to
the
sequel
of
the
noise
that
alarm
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
an
expedient
of
the
painter
,
to
awaken
his
Dulcinea
,
with
whom
he
have
make
an
assignation
,
or
at
least
interchange
such
signal
as
he
think
amount
to
a
firm
appointment
.
<EOS>
His
nymph
be
disturb
in
her
first
fleep
,
immediately
understand
the
sound
,
and
true
to
the
agreement
,
rise
,
and
unbolt
the
door
as
softly
as
possible
,
give
him
admittance
,
leave
it
open
for
his
more
commodious
retreat

<EOS>
while
this
happy
gallant
be
employ
in
disengage
himself
from
the
dishabille
in
which
he
have
enter
,
the
Capuchin
suspect
that
Peregrine
would
make
another
attempt
upon
his
charge
,
have
creep
silently
to
the
apartment
,
in
order
to
reconnoitre
,
lest
the
adventure
should
be
atchieve
without
his
knowledge
;
a
circumstance
that
would
deprive
him
of
the
profit
he
may
expect
from
his
privity
and
concurrence
.
    
<EOS>
find
the
door
unlatched
,
his
suspicion
be
confirm
,
and
he
make
no
scruple
of
creep
into
the
chamber
on
all
-
four
;
so
that
the
painter
have
stript
himself
to
the
shirt
,
in
grope
about
for
his
dulcinea
's
bed
,
chance
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
shave
crown
of
the
father

head
,
which
by
a
circular
motion
,
the
priest
begin
to
turn
round
in
his
grasp
,
like
a
ball
in
a
socket
,
to
the
surprize
and
consternation
of
poor
Pallet
,
who
have
neither
penetration
to
comprehend
the
case
,
nor
resolution
to
withdraw
his
finger
from
this
strange
object
of
his
touch
,
stand
sweat
in
the
dark
,
and
vent
ejaculation
with
great
devotion
,
till
the
friar
tired
with
this
exercise
,
and
the
painful
posture
in
which
he
stoop
,
raise
himself
gradually
upon
his
foot
,
heave
up
at
the
same
time
the
hand
of
the
painter
,
whose
terror
and
amazement
increase
to
such
a
degree
at
this
unaccountable
elevation
,
that
his
faculty
begin
to
fail

and
his
palm

the
confusion
of
his
fright
slide
over
the
priest

forehead
,
one
of
his

happen
to

Our

by

exclamation

at
his

mortifying
disappointment

be
oblige
to
quit
the
untasted

the

just

discharge
such
a
hearty

between
his

precaution

follow
Peregrine
into
the
room
,
pronounce
Benedicite

cross
himself
with

mark
of

extremely
ridiculous

provoke
the

to
a
smile

produce
a
small
relaxation
in

the

that
one
of

itself
sensible
to
his
feeling

in
the
shape
of
a
round
ball
of
smooth
flesh

that

round
under
his

like
an
astronomer

rise
up
to
a

height

by

next
day
,
about
one
o'clock
,
after

every
thing
remarkable
in

,
and
be
present
at
the
execution
of
two
youth
,
who
be
hang
for
ravish
a
whore
,
they
take
their
departure
from
Ghent
,
in
the
same
carriage
which
have
bring
them
thither
;
and
the
conversation
turn
upon
the
punishment
they
have
see
inflict
,
the
flemish
beauty
express
great
sympathy
and
compassion
for
the
unhappy
sufferer
,
who
(
as
she
have
be
inform
)
have
fall
victim
to
the
malice
of
the
accuser
.
<EOS>
Her
sentiment
be
espouse
by
all
the
company
,
except
the
french
lady
of
pleasure
,
who
,
think
the
credit
of
the
sisterhood
concern
in
the
affair
,
bitterly
inveigh
against
the
profligacy
of
the
age
,
and
particularly
the
base
and
villainous
attempt
of
man
,
upon
the
chastity
of
the
weak
sex
;
say
,
with
a
look
of
indignation
direct
to
the
painter
,
that
for
her
own
part
,
she
should
never
be
able
to
manifest
the
acknowledgment
she
owe
to
providence
,
for
have
protect
her
,
last
night
,
from
the
wicked
aim
of
unbridled
lust
.
    
<EOS>
this
observation
introduce
a
series
of
joke
,
at
the
expence
of
Pallet
,
who
hang
his
ear
,
and
sit
with
a
silent
air
of
dejection
,
fear
that
through
the
malevolence
of
the
physician
,
his
adventure
may
reach
the
ear
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
though
we
have
make
shift
to
explain
the
whole
transaction
to
the
reader
,
it
be
an
inextricable
mystery
to
every
individual
in
the
diligence
;
because
the
part
which
be
act
by
the
Capuchin
,
be
know
to
himself
alone
;
and
even
he
be
utterly
ignorant
of
Pickle
's
be
concern
in
the
affair
;
so
that
the
great
share
of
the
painter
's
suffering
be
suppose
to
be
the
exaggeration
of
his
own
extravagant
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
their
discourse
on
this
extraordinary
subject
,
the
driver
tell
them
,
that
they
be
now
on
the
very
spot
where
a
detachment
of
the
ally
army
have
be
intercept
and
cut
off
by
the
French
;
and
stop
the
vehicle
,
entertain
them
with
a
local
description
of
the
battle
of
Melle
.
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
,
the
flemish
lady
,
who
since
her
marriage
have
become
a
keen
partizan
for
the
French
,
give
a
minute
detail
of
all
the
circumstance
,
as
they
have
be
represent
to
her
by
her
husband
's
brother
,
who
be
in
the
action
;
and
this
account
,
which
sink
the
number
of
the
French
to
sixteen
,
and
raise
that
of
the
ally
to
twenty
thousand
man
,
be
so
disagreeable
to
truth
,
as
well
as
to
the
laudable
partiality
of
Peregrine
,
that
he
venture
to
contradict
her
assertion
,
and
a
fierce
dispute
commence
,
that
not
only
regard
the
present
question
,
but
also
comprehend
all
the
battle
in
which
the
duke
of
Marlborough
have
command
against
Lewis
the
fourteenth
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
these
debate
,
she
divest
that
great
general
of
all
the
glory
he

that
every

by
the
french
general
,
in
order
to
bring
the
scheme
of
madam
de
Maintenon
into
discredit
;
and
as
a
particular
instance
,
alledge
that
while
the
citadel
of
Lisle
be
besiege
,
Lewis
say
,
in
presence
of
the
Dauphin
,
that
if
the
ally
should
be
oblige
to
raise
the
siege
,
he
would
immediately
declare
his
marriage
with
that
lady
;
upon
which
,
the
son
send
private
order
to
marshal
bouffler
to
surrender
the
place
.
<EOS>
this
strange
allegation
be
support
by
the
asseveration
of
the
priest
and
the
courtezan
,
and
admit
as
truth
by
the
governor
,
who
pretend
to
have
hear
it
from
good
authority
:
while
the
doctor
sit
neutral
,
as
one
who
think
it
scandalous
to
know
the
history
of
such
modern
event
;
and
the
Israelite
,
be
a
true
Dutchman
,
list
himself
under
the
banner
of
our
hero
,
who
in
attempt
to
demonstrate
the
absurdity
and
improbability
of
what
they
have
advance
,
raise
such
a
hue
and
cry
against
himself
,
and
be
insensibly
heat
in
the
altercation
,
irritate
his
Amanda
to
such
a
degree
,
that
her
charming
eye
kindle
with
fury
,
and
he
see
great
reason
to
think
,
that
if
he
do
not
fall
upon
some
method
to
deprecate
her
wrath
,
she
would
in
a
twinkle
sacrifice
all
her
esteem
for
him
,
to
her
own
zeal
for
the
glory
of
the
french
nation
.
<EOS>
sway
by
this
apprehension
,
his
ardour
cool
by
degree
,
and
he
insensibly
detach
himself
from
the
argument
,
leave
the
whole
care
of
support
it
on
the
Jew
,
who
find
himself
desert
,
be
fain
to
yeild
at
discretion
;
so
that
the
French
remain
master
of
the
field
,
and
their
young
heroine
resume
her
good
humour
.
    
<EOS>
and
let
the
circumstance
of
this
contention
warn
the
reader
,
against
all
dispute
with
female
politician
;
unless
he
be
desirous
of
incur
their
animosity
and
implacable
resentment
;
for
,
in
matter
of
state
,
they
be
all
,
to
a
woman
,
enthusiast
,
who
believe
that
all
those
who
differ
from
them
in
opinion
,
be
in
a
state
of
reprobation
;
and
,
far
from
lay
any
stress
upon
probability
,
in
the
article
of
their
faith
,
like
believer
of
another
class
,
disdainfully
reject
the
evidence
of
reason
,
and
trust
to
the
revelation
of
their
own
fancy
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
have
therefore
prudently
submit
to
the
superior
intelligence
of
his
fair
enslaver
,
begin
to
be
harrasse
with
the
fear
of
lose
her
for
ever
,
upon
their
arrival
at
Brussels
,
and
set
his
invention
at
work
,
to
contrive
some
mean
of
indemnify
himself
for
his
assiduity
,
present
,
and
the
disappointment
he
have
already
undergo
,
before
they
should
reach
that
city
:
on
pretence
of
enjoy
a
free
air
,
he
mount
the
box
,
and
employ
his
elocution
and
generosity
with
such
success
,
that
the
driver
undertake
to
disable
the
Diligence
from
proceed
beyond
the
town
of
Alost
for
that
day
;
and
in
consequence
of
his
promise
,
gently
overturn
it
,
when
they
be
about
a
mile
short
of
that
baiting
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
his
measure
so
discreetly
,
that
this
accident
be
attend
with
no
other
inconvenience
than
a
fit
of
fear
,
that
take
possession
of
the
lady
,
and
the
necessity
to
which
they
be
reduce
,
by
the
declaration
of
the
coachman
,
who
,
upon
examine
the
carriage
,
assure
the
company
that
the
axle
-
tree
have
give
way
,
and
advise
them
to
walk
forward
to
the
inn
,
while
he
would
jog
after
them
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
do
his
endeavour
that
the
damage
should
be
immediately
repair
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
pretend
to
be
very
much
concerned
at
what
have
happen
,
and
even
curse
the
driver
for
his
inadvertency
,
express
infinite
impatience
to
be
at
Brussels
,
and
wish
that
this
misfortune
may
not
detain
them
another
night
upon
the
road
;
but
when
his
understapper
,
accord
to
his
instruction
,
come
afterwards
to
the
inn
,
and
give
them
to
understand
,
that
the
workman
he
have
employ
,
could
not
possibly
refit
the
machine
in
less
than
six
hour
,
the
crafty
youth
affect
to
lose
all
temper
,
storm
at
his
emissary
,
whom
he
revile
in
the
most
opprobious
term
,
and
threaten
to
cane
for
his
misconduct
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
protest
,
with
great
humility
,
that
their
be
overturn
be
owe
to
the
failure
of
the
axle
-
tree
,
and
not
to
his
want
of
care
or
dexterity
in
driving
;
though
rather
than
be
think
the
cause
of
incommode
him
,
he
would
inquire
for
a
post
-
chaise
,
in
which
he
may
depart
for
Brussels
immediately
.
<EOS>
this
expedient
Pickle
reject
,
unless
the
whole
company
could
be
accommodate
in
the
same
manner
;
and
he
have
be
previously
inform
by
the
driver
,
that
the
town
could
not
furnish
more
than
one
vehicle
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
His
governor
,
who
be
quite
ignorant
of
his
scheme
,
represent
that
one
night
would
soon
be
pass
,
and
exhort
him
to
bear
this
small
disappointment
with
a
good
grace
,
especially
as
the
house
seem
to
be
well
provide
for
their
entertainment
,
and
the
company
so
much
disposed
to
be
sociable
.
    
<EOS>
the
Capuchin
,
who
have
find
his
account
in
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
stranger
,
be
not
ill
-
pleased
at
this
event
,
which
may
,
by
protract
the
term
of
their
intercourse
,
yield
him
some
opportunity
of
profit
still
further
by
his
liberality
:
he
therefore
join
Mr
Jolter
in
his
admonition
,
congratulate
himself
upon
the
prospect
of
enjoy
his
conversation
a
little
longer
than
he
have
expect
;
and
our
young
gentleman
receive
a
compliment
to
the
same
purpose
from
the
Hebrew
,
who
have
that
day
exercise
his
gallantry
upon
the
french
coquette
,
and
be
not
without
hope
of
reap
the
fruit
of
his
attention
,
his
rival
,
the
painter
,
be
quite
disgrace
and
deject
by
the
adventure
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
doctor
,
he
be
too
much
engross
in
the
contemplation
of
his
own
importance
,
to
interest
himself
in
the
affair
,
or
its
consequence
,
further
than
by
observe
,
that
the
european
power
ought
to
establish
public
game
,
like
those
that
be
celebrate
of
old
in
Greece
;
in
which
case
,
every
state
would
be
supply
with
such
dextrous
charioteer
,
as
could
drive
a
machine
at
full
speed
,
within
a
hair
's
breadth
of
a
precipice
,
without
any
danger
of
its
be
overthrow
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
could
not
help
yield
to
their
remonstrance
,
and
united
complaisance
,
for
which
he
thank
them
in
very
polite
term
,
and
his
passion
seem
to
subside
,
propose
that
they
should
amuse
themselves
in
walk
round
the
rampart
,
with
a
view
of
enjoy
some
private
conversation
with
his
admired
Fleming
,
who
have
this
whole
day
behave
with
remarkable
reserve
.
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
embrace
,
he
(
as
usual
)
hand
her
into
the
street
,
and
take
all
opportunity
of
promote
his
suit
;
but
they
be
attend
so
closely
by
her
father
confessor
,
that
he
foresee
it
would
be
impracticable
to
accomplish
his
aim
,
without
the
connivance
of
that
ecclesiastick
,
which
he
be
oblige
to
purchase
with
another
purse
,
that
he
offer
,
and
be
accept
as
a
charitable
atonement
for
his
criminal
behaviour
during
the
interview
which
the
friar
have
procure
for
the
good
of
his
soul
.
    
<EOS>
this
benefaction
be
no
sooner
make
,
than
the
pious
mendicant
edge
off
by
little
and
little
,
till
he
join
the
rest
of
the
company
,
leave
his
generous
patron
at
full
liberty
to
prosecute
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
doubt
that
our
adventurer
make
a
good
use
of
this
occasion
:
he
practise
a
thousand
flower
of
rhetoric
,
and
actually
exhaust
his
whole
address
,
in
persuade
her
to
have
compassion
upon
his
misery
,
and
indulge
him
with
another
private
audience
,
without
which
he
should
run
distract
,
and
be
guilty
of
extravagancy
,
which
,
in
the
humanity
of
her
disposition
,
she
would
weep
to
see
.
<EOS>
but
,
instead
of
comply
with
his
request
,
she
chide
him
severely
for
his
presumption
,
in
persecute
her
with
his
vicious
address
;
and
assure
him
,
that
although
she
have
secure
a
chamber
for
herself
in
this
place
,
because
she
have
no
ambition
to
be
better
acquaint
with
the
other
lady
,
he
would
be
in
the
wrong
to
disturb
her
with
another
nocturnal
visit
;
for
she
be
determined
to
deny
him
admittance
.
<EOS>
the
lover
be
comfort
by
this
hint
,
which
he
understand
in
the
true
acceptation
,
and
his
passion
be
inflame
by
the
obstacle
he
have
meet
with
in
this
intrigue
,
his
heart
beat
high
with
the
prospect
of
possession
.
<EOS>
these
rapture
of
expectation
produce
an
inquietude
,
which
disable
him
from
bear
that
share
of
the
conversation
for
which
he
use
to
be
distinguish
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
at
supper
be
a
vicissitude
of
starting
,
and
reverie
;
and
the
Capuchin
impute
this
disorder
to
a
second
repulse
from
his
charge
,
begin
to
be
invade
with
the
apprehension
of
be
oblige
to
refund
,
and
in
a
whisper
forbad
our
hero
to
despair

that

upon
the

such
innovation
upon
his

that

cultivate
her
with
peculiar
complacency
,
gaze
upon
her
with
a
most
libidinous
stare
,
and
unbend
his
aspect
into
a
grin
that

truly
israelitish

the

,
and

at
this
correspondence
,
which
he
consider
as
an
insult
upon
his
misfortune
,
as
well
as
an
evident
preference
of
his
rival

conscious
of
his

timidity

swallow
an
extraordinary
glass

may

raise

of
some
scheme

the

however
,
fail
in
the

and
without

him
with
the
plan
,
serve
only

quicken
his
desire
of
vengeance
;
so
that
he
communicate
his
purpose
to
his
friend
Peregrine
,
and
beg
the
assistance
of
his
imagination
;
but
our
young

too
intent
upon
his

the

recourse
to
the
genius
of

in
all
the

of

and

to
the
chamber
of
his
charmer

and
find
the
door
unbolted
,
enter
in
a
transport
of
joy
.
<EOS>
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
shine
through
the

,
he
be
conduct
to
her
bed
,
which
he
approach
in
the
utmost
agitation
,
and
perceive
her
to
all
appearance
asleep
,
essay
to
wake
her
with
a
gentle
kiss
;
but
this
method
prove
ineffectual
,
because
she
be
determine
to
save
herself
the
confusion
of
be
an
accomplice
in
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
the
application
,
murmur
a
most
passionate
salutation
in
her
ear
,
and
take
such
other
gentle
method
of
signify
his
presence
,
as
persuade
him
that
she
be
resolve
to
sleep
,
in
spite
of

he
lock
the
door
,
in
order
to
prevent

and
steal
himself
under
the
cloath
,
set
fortune
at
defiance
,
while
he
hold
the

in
his
arm

nevertheless
,
near
as
he
seem
to
be
to
the

of
his

his

be
again
frustrate
by
a

noise

which

moment

his

in
a

the

his
valet

,
whom

consult
as
a
confederate
,
in
his
revenge
against
the
lady
of

and
her
jewish

have
hire
of
certain
Behemians
,
who
chance
to
lodge
at
the
inn
,
a
jack

ass
adorn
with
bell
,
which
,
when
every
body
be
retire
to
rest
,
and
the
Hebrew
suppose
to

with

they
lead
up

stair
into
a
long
thoroughfare

from
which

each
side

the
lady

expectation

mount
this
animal

with
intention
to
ride
into
the
room
,
and
disturb
the
lover
in
the
midst
of
their
mutual

but
the
ass
,
true
to
his
kind
,
find
himself
bestrid
by
an
unknown
rider
,
instead
of
advance
,
in
obedience
to
his
conductor
,
retreat
backwards
to
the
other
end
of
the
passage

in
spite
of
all
the
effort
of
the
painter
,
who
spur

and
kick
,
and
pummel
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
noise
of
this
contention
between
Pallet
and
the
ass
,
which
invade
the
ear
of
Peregrine
and
his
mistress
,
neither
of
whom

form
the
least
rational
conjecture
about
the
cause
of
such
strange
disturbance

which
increase
as

which
it

with
such
complication
of
sound

as
terrify
the

almost
into
a
fit
,
and
throw
her
lover
into
an
agony
of
perplexity
and
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
the
painter
,
find
himself
thus
violently
intrude
into
the
bed
-
chamber
of
he
know
not
whom

and
dread
the
resentment
of
the
possessor
,
who
may
discharge
a
pistol
at
him
,
as
a
robber
who
have
break
into
his
apartment
,
be
overwhelmed
with
consternation
,
and
redouble
his
exertion
,
to
accomplish
a
speedy
retreat
,
sweat
all
the
time
with
fear
,
and
put
up
petition
to
heaven
for
his
safety
;
but
his
obstinate
companion
,
regardless
of
his
situation
,
instead
of
submit
to
his
conduct

begin
to
turn
round
like
a
millstone

the
united
sound
of
his
foot
and

a
most
surprising
concert
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
rider
,
whirl
about
in
this
manner
,
would
have
quit
his
seat

and
leave
the

seize
one
of
its
ear

which

so
unmercifully

that
the
creature
set
up
his
throat

aloud

this
hideous
exclamation

hear
by
the
fair

with
panic

Her

with
the
most
violent
pang
of
rage

disappointment

this
diabolical
noise
seem
to
proceed

and
encounter
the
ass
,
discharge
such
a
volley
of
blow
at
him
and
his
rider
,
that
the
creature
carry
him
off
at
a
round
trot
,
and
they
roar
in
unison
all
the
way

<EOS>
have
thus
clear
the
room
of
such
disagreeable
company
,
he
go
back
to
his

and
assure
her

that
this

some
foolish
prank

after

<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
the
noise
of
the
Bourrique
,
the
cry
of
the
painter
,
and
the
lady
's
scream
,
have
alarm
the
whole
house
;
and
the
ass
,
in
the
precipitation
of
his
retreat
,
see
people
with
light
before
him
,
take
shelter
in
the
apartment
for
which
he
be
at
first
design
,
just
as
the
Levite
,
arrouse
at
the
uproar
,
have
quit
his
dulcinea
,
and
be
attempt
to
recover
his
own
chamber
,
unperceived
;
but
,
see
himself
oppose
by
such
an
animal
,
mount
by
a
tall
,
meagre
,
lanthorn
-
jawed
figure
,
half
naked
,
with
a
white
night
-
cap
upon
his
head
,
which
add
to
the
natural
paleness
of
his
complexion
,
the
Jew
be
sorely
trouble
in
mind
,
and
believe
it
to
be
an
apparition
of
Balaam
and
his
ass
,
flee
backward
with
a
nimble
pace
,
and
creep
under
the
bed
,
where
he
lie
conceal
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
and
the
priest
,
who
be
the
foremost
of
those
who
have
be
arrouse
by
the
noise
,
be
not
unmoved
when
they
see
such
a
spectacle
rush
into
this
chamber
,
from
whence
the
lady
of
pleasure
begin
to
shriek
.
<EOS>
the
governor
make
a
full
halt
,
and
the
Capuchin
discover
no
inclination
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
They
be
(
however
)
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
that
follow
them
,
thrust
forward
to
the
door
,
through
which
the
vision
enter
;
and
<EOS>
there
Jolter
,
with
great
ceremony
,
compliment
his
reverence
with
the
pas
,
beseech
him
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
the
mendicant
be
too
courteous
and
humble
to
accept
this
preheminence
,
and
a
very
earnest
dispute
ensue
;
during
which
the
ass
,
in
the
course
of
his
circuit
,
shew
himself
and
rider
,
and
in
a
trice
decide
the
contest
;
for
,
strike
with
this
second
glimpse
,
both
,
at
one
instant
,
spring
backward
with
such
force
,
as
overturn
their
next
man
,
who
communicate
the
impulse
to
those
that
stand
behind
them
,
and
these
again
to
other
;
so
that
the
whole
passage
be
strew
with
a
long
file
of
people
,
that
lie
in
a
line
,
like
the
sequel
and
dependance
of
a
pack
of
card
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
havock
,
our
hero
return
from
his
own
room
,
with
an
air
of
astonishment
,
ask
the
cause
of
this
uproar
,
and
receive
such
hint
of
intelligence
as
Jolter
's
consternation
would
permit
him
to
give
,
snatch
the
candle
out
of
his
hand
,
and
advance
into
the
haunted
chamber
without
hesitation
,
be
follow
by
all
present
,
who
break
forth
into
a
long
and
loud
peal
of
laughter
,
when
they
perceive
the
ludicrous
source
of
their
disquiet
.
<EOS>
the
painter
himself
make
an
effort
to
join
their
mirth
,
but
he
have
be
so
harrow
by
fear
,
and
smart
so
much
with
the
pain
of
the
discipline
he
have
receive
from
Pickle
,
that
he
could
not
,
with
all
his
endeavour
,
vanquish
the
ruefulness
of
his
countenance
;
and
his
attempt
serve
only
to
increase
the
aukwardness
of
his
situation
,
which
be
not
at
all
mend
by
the
behaviour
of
the
coquette
,
who
,
furious
with
her
disappointment
,
slip
on
a
petticoat
and
bed
-
gown
,
and
spring
upon
him
,
like
another
Hecuba
,
with
her
nail
,
deprive
all
one
side
of
his
nose
of
the
skin
,
and
would
not
have
leave
him
an
eye
to
see
thro
'
,
if
some
of
the
company
have
not
rescue
him
from
her
unmerciful
talon
.
    
<EOS>
provoke
at
this
outrage
,
as
well
as
by
her
behaviour
to
him
in
the
Diligence
,
he
publickly
explain
his
intention
in
enter
her
chamber
in
this
equipage
;
and
,
miss
the
Hebrew
among
the
spectator
,
assure
them
,
that
he
must
have
abscond
somewhere
in
the
apartment
:
in
consequence
of
this
intimation
,
the
room
be
immediately
search
,
and
the
mortify
Levite
pull
by
the
heel
from
his
lurk
place
;
so
that
Pallet
have
the
good
fortune
,
at
last
,
to
transfer
the
laugh
from
himself
to
his
rival
,
and
the
french
inamorata
,
who
accordingly
undergo
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
audience

Chapter
LXI
Pallet
,
endeavour
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
treatment
he
have
receive
,
fall
out
of
the
fry
pan
into
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Pallet
be
still
confound
,
and
chagrin
by
one
consideration
,
which
be
no
other
than
that
of
his
have
be
so
roughly
handle
in
the
chamber
,
belong
(
as
he
find
upon
enquiry
)
to
the
handsome
young
lady
,
who
be
under
the
Capuchin
's
direction
.
<EOS>
He
recollect
,
that
the
door
be
fast
lock
,
when
his
beast
burst
it
open
,
and
he
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
person
follow
him
in
his
irruption
:
on
the
other
hand
,
he
could
not
imagine
,
that
such
a
gentle
creature
would
either
attempt
to
commit
,
or
be
able
to
execute
such
a
desperate
assault
as
that
which
his
body
have
sustain
;
and
her
demeanor
be
so
modest
and
circumspect
,
that
he
durst
not
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
her
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
these
reflexion
bewilder
him
in
the
labyrinth
of
thought
:
he
rummage
his
whole
imagination
,
endeavour
to
account
for
what
have
happen
;
and
at
length
conclude
,
that
either
Peregrine
,
or
the
devil
,
or
both
,
must
have
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
determine
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
curiosity
,
to
watch
our
hero
's
motion
,
during
the
remain
part
of
the
night
,
so
narrowly
,
that
his
conduct
,
mysterious
as
it
be
,
should
not
be
able
to
elude
his
penetration
.
    
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
he
retire
to
his
own
room
,
after
the
ass
have
be
restore
to
the
right
owner
,
and
the
priest
have
visit
and
confirm
his
fair
ward
,
who
have
be
almost
distract
with
fear
;
and
silence
no
sooner
prevail
again
,
than
he
crawl
darkling
towards
her
door
,
and
huddle
himself
up
in
an
obscure
corner
,
from
whence
he
may
observe
the
ingress
or
egress
of
any
human
creaure
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
long
remain
in
this
posture
,
when
,
fatigue
with
this
adventure
,
and
that
of
the
precede
night
,
his
faculty
be
gradually
overpower
with
slumber
,
and
fall
fast
asleep
,
he
begin
to
snore
like
a
whole
congregation
of
presbyterian
.
<EOS>
the
flemish
beauty
,
hear
this
discordant
noise
in
the
passage
,
begin
to
be
afraid
of
some
new
alarm
,
and
very
prudently
bolt
her
door
;
so
that
when
her
lover
want
to
repeat
his
visit
,
he
be
not
only
surprised
and
incensed
at
this
disagreeable
serenade
,
the
author
of
which
he
do
not
know
;
but
when
,
compel
by
his
passion
,
which
be
by
this
time
wound
to
the
high
pitch
,
he
venture
to
approach
the
entrance
,
he
have
the
extreme
mortification
to
find
himself
shut
out
;
and
he
durst
not
knock
,
or
signify
his
presence
in
any
other
manner
,
on
account
of
the
lady
's
reputation
,
which
would
have
greatly
suffer
,
<EOS>
have
the
snorer
be
wake
by
his
endeavour
.
    
<EOS>
have
he
know
that
the
person
who
thus
thwart
his
view
,
be
the
painter
,
he
would
have
take
some
effectual
step
to
remove
him
;
but
he
could
not
conceive
what
should
induce
Pallet
to
take
up
his
residence
in
that
corner
;
nor
could
he
use
the
assistance
of
a
light
,
to
distinguish
him
,
because
there
be
not
a
candle
burn
in
the
house
;
and
besides
,
the
sleeper
may
have
open
his
eye
in
the
very
moment
of
his
be
detect
by
Peregrine
,
who
would
have
incur
suspicion
,
by
appear
,
at
such
an
hour
,
at
that
part
of
the
inn
,
so
remote
from
his
own
bed
-
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
describe
the
rage
and
vexation
of
our
hero
,
while
he
continue
thus
tantalize
upon
the
brink
of
bliss
,
after
his
desire
have
be
exasperate
by
the
circumstance
of
his
two
former
disappointment
.
<EOS>
He
ejaculate
a
thousand
execration
against
his
own
fortune
,
curse
all
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
without
exception
,
vow
revenge
against
the
painter
,
who
have
twice
confound
his
most
interesting
scheme
,
and
be
tempt
to
execute
immediate
vengeance
upon
the
unknown
cause
of
his
present
misadventure
.
<EOS>
in
this
agony
of
distraction
do
he
sweat
two
whole
hour
in
the
passage
,
though
not
without
some
faint
hope
of
be
deliver
from
his
tormentor
,
who
(
he
imagine
)
upon
wake
,
would
undoubtedly
shift
his
quarter
,
and
leave
the
field
free
to
his
design
;
but
when
he
hear
the
cock
repeat
his
salutation
to
the
morn
,
which
begin
to
open
on
the
rear
of
night
,
he
could
no
longer
restrain
his
indignation
,
but
go
to
his
own
chamber
,
fill
a
basin
with
cold
water
,
and
,
stand
at
some
distance
,
discharge
it
full
in
the
face
of
the
gape
snorer
,
who
,
over
and
above
the
surprize
occasion
by
the
application
,
be
almost
suffocate
by
the
liquor
that
enter
his
mouth
,
and
run
down
into
his
wind
-
pipe
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
gasp
like
a
person
half
drown
,
without
know
the
nature
of
his
disaster
,
or
remembre
the
situation
in
which
he
fall
asleep
;
Peregrine
retire
to
his
own
door
,
and
,
to
his
no
small
astonishment
,
from
a
long
howl
that
invade
his
ear
,
learn
that
the
patient
be
no
other
than
Pallet
,
who
have
now
,
for
the
third
time
,
baulk
his
good
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
enrage
at
the
complicated
trespass
of
this
unfortunate
offender
,
he
rush
from
his
apartment
with
a
horse
-
whip
,
and
encounter
the
painter
in
his
flight
,
overturn
him
in
the
passage
,
and
exercise
the
instrument
of
his
wrath
with
great
severity
,
on
pretence
of
mistake
him
for
some
presumptuous
cur
,
which
have
disturb
the
repose
of
the
inn
;
nay
,
when
he
call
aloud
for
mercy
in
a
supplicate
tone
,
and
his
chastiser
could
no
longer
pretend
to
treat
him
as
a
quadruped
,
such
be
the
virulence
of
the
young
gentleman
's
indignation
,
that
he
could
not
help
declare
his
satisfaction
,
by
tell
Pallet
he
have
richly
deserve
the
punishment
he
have
undergo
,
for
his
madness
,
folly
and
impertinence
,
in
contrive
and
execute
such
idle
scheme
,
as
have
no
other
tendency
than
that
of
plague
his
neighbour
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
protest
with
great
vehemence
,
that
he
be
innocent
as
the
child
unborn
of
any
intention
to
give
umbrage
to
any
person
whatever
,
except
the
Israelite
and
his
doxy
,
who
he
know
have
incur
his
displeasure
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
as
God
be
my
Saviour
!
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
persecute
with
witchcraft
,
and
begin
to
think
that
damn'd
priest
be
an
agent
of
the
devil
;
for
he
have
be
but
two
night
in
our
company
,
during
which
I
have
not
close
an
eye
,
but
on
the
contrary
have
be
torment
by
all
the
fiend
of
hell
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
peevishly
reply
,
that
his
torment
have
be
occasion
by
his
own
foolish
imagination
;
and
ask
how
he
come
to
howl
in
that
corner
.
<EOS>
the
painter
,
who
do
not
think
proper
to
own
the
truth
,
say
,
that
he
have
be
transport
thither
by
some
preternatural
conveyance
,
and
souse
in
water
by
an
invisible
hand
:
and
the
youth
,
in
hope
of
profit
by
his
absence
,
advise
him
to
retire
immediately
to
his
bed
,
and
by
sleep
strive
to
comfort
his
brain
,
which
seem
to
be
not
a
little
disorder
by
the
want
of
that
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Pallet
himself
begin
to
be
very
much
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
,
and
in
compliance
with
such
wholesome
counsel
,
betook
himself
to
rest
,
mutter
prayer
all
the
way
for
the
recovery
of
his
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
attend
him
to
his
chamber
,
and
lock
him
up
,
put
the
key
in
his
own
pocket
,
that
he
may
not
have
it
in
his
power
to
interrupt
him
again
:
but
in
his
return
he
be
meet
by
Mr
Jolter
and
the
doctor
,
who
have
be
a
second
time
alarm
by
the
painter
's
cry
,
and
come
thither
to
inquire
about
this
new
adventure
.
<EOS>
half
frantic
with
such
a
series
of
disappointment
,
he
curse
them
in
his
heart
for
their
unseasonable
appearance
;
and
when
they
question
him
about
Pallet
,
tell
them
he
have
find
him
stark
stare
mad
,
howl
in
a
corner
and
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
conduct
him
to
his
room
,
where
he
be
now
abed
.
<EOS>
the
physician
hear
this
circumstance
,
make
a
merit
of
his
vanity
,
and
under
pretence
of
concern
for
the
patient
's
welfare
,
desire
he
may
have
an
opportunity
of
examine
the
symptom
of
his
disorder
,
without
loss
of
time
;
alledging
,
that
many
disease
may
have
be
stifle
in
the
birth
,
which
afterwards
baffle
all
the
endeavour
of
the
medical
art
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
accordingly
deliver
the
key
,
and
once
more
withdraw
into
his
own
chamber
,
with
a
view
of
seize
the
first
occasion
that
should
present
itself
of
renew
his
application
to
his
Amanda
's
door
;
while
the
doctor
,
in
his
way
to
Pallet
's
apartment
,
hint
to
the
governor
his
suspicion
,
that
the
patient
labour
under
that
dreadful
symptom
call
the
hydrophobia
,
which
he
observe
have
sometimes
appear
in
person
who
be
not
previously
bite
by
a
mad
dog
.
<EOS>
this
conjecture
he
found
upon
the
howl
he
utter
when
he
be
souse
with
water
,
and
begin
to
recollect
certain
circumstance
of
the
painter
's
behaviour
for
some
day
's
past
,
which
now
he
could
plainly
perceive
have
prognosticate
some
such
calamity
.
<EOS>
He
then
ascribe
the
distemper
to
the
violent
fright
he
have
lately
undergo
,
affirm
that
the
affair
of
the
Bastile
have
make
such
a
violent
incroachment
upon
his
understanding
,
that
his
manner
of
think
and
speaking
be
intirely
alter
;
and
by
a
theory
of
his
own
invention
,
explain
the
effect
of
fear
upon
a
loose
system
of
nerve
,
and
demonstrate
the
modus
in
which
the
animal
spirit
operate
upon
the
idea
and
power
of
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
this
disquisition
,
which
be
communicate
at
the
painter
's
door
,
may
have
last
till
breakfast
,
have
not
Jolter
remind
him
of
his
own
maxim
,
Venienti
occurrite
morbo
;
upon
which
he
put
the
key
to
immediate
use
,
and
they
walk
softly
towards
the
bed
,
where
the
patient
lie
extended
at
full
length
in
the
arm
of
slumber
.
    
<EOS>
the
physician
take
notice
of
his
breathing
hard
,
and
his
mouth
be
open
;
and
from
these
diagnostic
declare
,
that
the
liquidum
nervosum
be
intimately
affect
,
and
the
saliva
impregnate
with
the
spiculate
particle
of
the
virus
,
howsoever
contract
.
<EOS>
this
sentence
be
still
farther
confirm
by
the
state
of
his
pulse
,
which
be
full
and
slow
,
indicate
an
oppress
circulation
,
from
a
loss
of
elasticity
in
the
propel
artery
;
and
he
propose
,
that
he
should
immediately
suffer
a
second
aspersion
of
water
,
which
would
not
only
contribute
to
the
cure
,
but
also
certify
them
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
,
with
regard
to
the
state
of
the
disease
:
for
it
would
evidently
appear
,
from
the
manner
in
which
he
would
bear
the
application
,
whether
or
not
his
horror
of
water
amount
to
a
confirm
hydrophobia
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
in
compliance
with
this
proposal
,
begin
to
empty
a
bottle
of
water
,
which
he
find
in
the
room
in
a
basin
;
when
he
be
interrupt
by
the
prescriber
,
who
advise
him
to
use
the
content
of
the
chamber
-
pot
,
which
be
impregnate
with
salt
,
would
operate
more
effectually
than
pure
element
.
<EOS>
thus
direct
,
the
governor
lift
up
the
vessel
,
which
be
replete
with
medicine
,
and
with
one
turn
of
his
hand
discharge
the
whole
healing
inundation
upon
the
ill
-
omen'd
patient
,
who
wake
in
the
utmost
distraction
of
horror
,
yell
most
hideously
,
just
at
the
time
when
Peregrine
have
bring
his
mistress
to
a
parley
,
and
entertain
hope
of
be
admit
into
her
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
Terrified
at
this
exclamation
,
she
instantly
break
off
the
treaty
,
beseech
him
to
retire
from
the
door
,
that
her
honour
may
receive
no
injury
from
his
be
find
in
that
place
;
and
he
have
just
enough
of
recollection
leave
to
see
the
necessity
of
obey
the
order
;
in
conformity
to
which
he
retreat
,
well
nigh
deprive
of
his
sense
,
and
almost
persuade
,
that
so
many
unaccountable
disappointment
must
have
proceed
from
some
supernatural
cause
,
of
which
the
idiot
Pallet
be
no
more
than
the
involuntary
instrument
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
doctor
have
ascertain
the
malady
of
the
patient
,
whose
cry
,
interrupt
by
frequent
sobs
and
sigh
,
he
interpret
into
the
barking
of
a
dog
;
have
no
more
salt
-
water
at
hand
,
resolve
to
renew
the
bath
with
such
material
as
chance
would
afford
,
and
actually
lay
hold
of
the
bottle
and
basin
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
,
the
painter
have
recover
the
use
of
his
sense
so
well
,
as
to
perceive
his
drift
;
and
start
up
,
like
a
frantic
Bedlamite
,
run
directly
to
his
sword
,
swear
with
many
horrid
imprecation
,
that
he
would
murder
them
both
immediately
,
if
he
should
be
hang
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
choose
to
wait
the
issue
of
his
threat
,
but
retire
with
such
precipitation
,
that
the
physician
have
almost
dislocate
his
shoulder
,
by
run
against
one
side
of
the
entry
;
and
Jolter
have
pull
the
door
after
him
,
and
turn
the
key
,
betook
himself
to
flight
,
roar
aloud
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
collegue
see
the
door
secure
,
value
himself
upon
his
resolution
,
and
exhort
him
to
return
;
declare
,
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
be
more
afraid
of
the
madman
's
tooth
than
of
his
weapon
,
and
admonish
the
governor
to
re
-
enter
,
and
execute
what
they
have
leave
undone
;
"
go
in
(
say
he
)
without
fear
or
apprehension
,
and
if
any
accident
shall
happen
to
you
,
either
from
his
slaver
or
his
sword
,
I
will
assist
you
with
my
advice
,
which
from
this
station
I
can
more
coolly
and
distinctly
administer
,
than
I
should
be
able
to
supply
,
if
my
idea
be
disturb
,
or
my
attention
engage
in
any
personal
concern
.
"
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
could
make
no
objection
to
the
justness
of
the
conclusion
,
frankly
own
,
that
he
have
no
inclination
to
try
the
experiment
;
observe
,
<EOS>
that
self
preservation
be
the
first
law
of
nature
;
that
his
connexion
with
the
unhappy
lunatic
be
but
slight
,
and
that
it
could
not
be
reasonably
expect
,
that
he
would
run
such
risk
for
his
service
,
as
be
decline
by
one
who
have
set
out
with
him
from
England
on
the
footing
of
a
companion
.
<EOS>
this
insinuation
introduce
a
dispute
upon
the
nature
of
benevolence
and
the
moral
sense
,
which
(
the
republican
argue
)
exist
independent
of
any
private
consideration
,
and
could
never
be
affect
by
any
contingent
circumstance
of
time
and
fortune
;
while
the
other
,
who
abhor
his
principle
,
assert
the
duty
and
excellence
of
private
friendship
,
with
infinite
rancour
of
altercation
.
    
<EOS>
during
the
hot
of
the
argument
,
they
be
join
by
the
Capuchin
,
who
be
astonish
to
see
them
thus
virulently
engage
at
the
door
,
and
to
hear
the
painter
bellowing
within
the
chamber
,
conjure
them
in
the
name
of
God
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
that
confusion
,
which
have
keep
the
whole
house
in
continual
alarm
during
the
good
part
of
the
night
,
and
seem
to
be
the
immediate
work
of
the
devil
and
his
angel
.
<EOS>
when
the
governor
give
him
to
understand
,
that
Pallet
be
visit
with
an
evil
spirit
,
he
mutter
a
prayer
of
St
Antonio
de
Padua
,
and
undertake
to
cure
the
painter
,
provide
he
could
be
secure
so
as
that
he
may
,
without
danger
to
himself
,
burn
part
of
a
certain
relick
under
his
nose
,
which
he
assure
them
be
equal
to
the
miraculous
power
of
Eleazar
's
ring
.
    
<EOS>
They
express
great
curiosity
to
know
what
this
treasure
be
;
and
the
priest
be
prevail
upon
to
tell
them
in
confidence
,
that
it
be
a
collection
of
the
paring
of
the
nail
belong
to
those
two
madman
whom
Jesus
purge
of
the
legion
of
devil
that
afterwards
enter
the
swine
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
pull
from
one
of
his
pocket
a
small
box
,
contain
about
an
ounce
of
the
paring
of
an
horse
's
hoof
;
at
sight
of
which
,
the
governor
could
not
help
smile
,
on
account
of
the
grossness
of
the
imposition
;
and
the
doctor
ask
,
with
a
supercilious
smile
,
whether
those
maniacs
whom
Jesus
cure
,
be
of
the
sorrel
complexion
,
or
dapple
grey
;
for
,
from
the
texture
of
these
paring
,
he
could
prove
,
that
the
original
owner
be
of
the
quadrupe
order
,
and
even
distinguish
,
that
their
foot
have
be
fortify
with
shoe
of
iron

<EOS>
the
mendicant

who
bear
an
inveterate
grudge
against
this
son
of
Aesculapius
,
ever
since
he
have
make
so
free
with
the
catholic
religion
,
reply
with
great
bitterness
,
that
he
be
a
wretch
with
whom
no
Christian
ought
to
communicate
;
that
the
vengeance
of
heaven
would
one
day
overtake
him
,
on
account
of
his
profanity
;
and
that
his
heart
be
shod
with
a
metal
much
hard
than
iron
,
which
he
be
afraid
<EOS>
nothing

hell

It
be

broad

all
the

it

obstruct

the
noise

put

in

ill

arrive
at
the
spot
where
this
triumvirate
stand
debate
about
the
mean
of
overpower
the
furious

,
who
still
continue
his
song
of
oath

execration

and
make
sundry
effort

break
open

Chagrin'd
as

tell
him

that
his

be
so
extravagant

as
to
confirm
the

in
the
belief

that
he
be
actually
deprive

on

supposition

Mr

have
act
the
part

in
do
that
which
they
think
most
couoncive
to
his
recovery
;
so
that
their
concern
merit
his
thankful
acknowledgment
,
instead
of
his
frantic
menace

and
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
would
be
the
first
to
condemn
him
,
as
one
utterly
bereft
of

give

this
alternative
quiet
his
transport
in
a
moment
;
he
be
terrify
at
the
apprehension
of
be
treat
like
a
Bedlamite
,
be
dubious
of
the
state
of
his

on
the

have
conceive
such
an
horror

antipathy
for

that

far
from

what
they

he
could
not
even
think
of
them
without
the
utmost
rage
and
detestation

<EOS>
He
therefore
,
in
the
most
tranquil
voice
he
could
assume

protest

that
he
never
be
less
out

as
he
apprehend

it
would
be
the
great
sign
of
madness
he
could
exhibit

to

the
mischief
they

every

absurdity

<EOS>
Peregrine
hold
a
consultation
upon
this
reply
,
when
the

physician
strenuously
argue
against
any
capitulation

method

profit
by
this
momentary
calm
,
and
order
him
to
be
blooded
,
blister
and
purge
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
.
    
<EOS>
the
governor
,
however
,
notwithstanding
this
caution
,
advanced
to
the
injure
party
,
and
begg'd
pardon
for
the
share
he
have
in
give
him
such
disturbance
,
declare
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
he
have
no
other
intention
than
that
of
contribute
towards
his
welfare
,
and
that
his
behaviour
be
the
result
of
the
physician
's
prescription
,
which
he
affirm
be
absolutely
necessary
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
.
    
<EOS>
the
painter
,
who
have
very
little
gall
in
his
disposition
,
be
satisfied
with
this
apology
;
but
his
resentment
,
which
be
before
divide
,
now
glow
with
double
fire
against
his
first
fellow
-
traveller
,
whom
he
look
upon
as
the
author
of
all
the
mischance
he
have
undergo
,
and
mark
out
for
his
vengeance
accordingly
.
<EOS>
yet
the
door
or
reconciliation
be
not
shut
against
the
doctor
,
who
with
great
justice
may
have
transfer
this
load
of
offence
from
himself
to
Peregrine
,
who
be
,
without
doubt
,
the
source
of
the
painter
's
misfortune
:
but
,
in
that
case
,
he
must
have
own
himself
mistaken
in
his
medical
capacity
;
and
he
do
not
think
the
friendship
of
Pallet
important
enough
to
sway
him
to
such
condescension
;
so
that
he
resolve
to
neglect
him
intirely
,
and
gradually
forget
the
former
correspondence
he
have
maintain
with
a
person
whom
he
deem
so
unworthy
of
his
notice

dispose
them
all
to
receive
the

seize

in
gentle
murmur
lament
his
hard
hap
in
be
thus
the
sport

<EOS>
He
assure
her
(
and
that
with
great
sincerity
)
that
all
the
cross
accident
of
his
life
have
not
cost
him
one
half
of
the
vexation
and
keenness
of
chagrin
which
he
have
suffer
last
night

and
that
now
he
be
on
the
brink
of
part
from
her
,
he
should
be
overwhelm
with
the
black
despair
,
if
she
would
not
extend
her
compassion
so
far
as
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
sigh
at
her
foot
in
Brussels
,
during
the
few
day
his
affair
would
permit
him
to
spend
in
that
city
.
    
<EOS>
this
young
lady
,
with
an
air
of
mortification
,
express
her
sorrow
for
be
the
innocent
cause
of
his
anxiety
;
say
,
she
hope
last
night
's
adventure
would
be
a
salutary
warning
to
both
their
soul
;
for
she
be
persuade
,
that
her
virtue
be
protect
by
the
intervention
of
heaven
;
that
whatever
impression
it
may
have
make
upon
him
,
she
be
enable
by
it
to
adhere
to
that
duty
from
which
her
passion
have
begin
to
swerve
,
and
beseech
him
to
forget
her
for
his
own
peace
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
neither
the
plan
she
have
lay
down
for
her
own
conduct
,
nor
the
dictate
of

honour
,
would
allow

to
receive
his
visit
,
or
carry
on
any
other
correspondence
with
him
,
while
she
be
restrict
by
the
article
of
her
marriage
-
vow
.
    
<EOS>
this
explanation
produce
such
a
violent
effect
upon
her
admirer
,
that
he
be
for
some
minute
deprive
of
the
faculty
of
speech
,
which
he
no
sooner
recover
,
than
he
give
vent
to
the
most
unbridled
transport
of
passion
.
    
<EOS>
He
tax
her
with
barbarity
and
indifference
;
tell
her
that
she
have
rob
him
of
his
reason
and
internal
peace
;
that
he
would
follow
her
to
the
end
of
the
earth
,
and
cease
to
live
sooner
than
cease
to
love
her
;
that
he
would
sacrifice
the
innocent
fool
who
have
be
the
occasion
of
all
this
disquiet
,
and
murder
every
man
whom
he
consider
as
an
obstruction
to
his
view
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
his
passion
,
which
have
continue
so
long
in
a
state
of
the
high
fermentation
,
together
with
the
want
of
that
repose
which
calm
and
quiet
the
perturbation
of
the
spirit
,
have
work
him
up
to
a
pitch
of
real
distraction
:
and
while
he
utter
these
delirious
expression
,
the
tear
run
down
his
cheek
,
and
he
undergo
such
agitation
,
that
the
tender
heart
of
the
fair
Fleming
be
affect
with
his
condition
;
and
,
while
her
own
face
be
bedew
with
the
stream
of
sympathy
,
she
beg
him
for
heaven
's
sake
to
be
compose
,
and
promise
,
for
his
satisfaction
,
to
abate
somewhat
of
the
rigor
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
console
by
this
kind
declaration
,
he
recollect
himself
,
and
take
out
his
pencil
,
give
her
his
address
,
when
she
have
assure
him
,
that
he
should
hear
from
her
in
four
and
twenty
hour
at
farthest
,
after
their
separation
.
    
<EOS>
thus
soothe
,
he
regain
the
empire
of
himself
,
and
by
degree
recover
his
serenity
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
case
with
his
Amanda
,
who
,
from
this
sample
of
his
disposition
,
dread
the
impetuosity
of
his
youth
,
and
be
effectually
deter
from
enter
into
any
engagement
that
may
subject
her
peace
and
reputation
to
the
rash
effect
of
such
a
violent
spirit
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
captivate
by
his
person
and
accomplishment
,
she
have
reflection
enough
to
foresee
,
that
the
longer
she
countenance
his
passion
,
her
own
heart
would
be
more
and
more
irretrievably
engage
,
and
the
quiet
of
her
life
the
more
exposed
to
continual
interruption
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
profit
by
these
consideration
,
and
a
sense
of
religious
honour
,
which
help
her
to
withstand
the
suggestion
of
inclination
;
and
resolve
to
amuse
her
lover
with
false
hope
,
until
she
should
have
it
in
her
power
to
relinquish
his
conversation
,
without
run
any
risk
of
suffer
by
the
inconsiderate
sally
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
this
view
,
that
she
desire
he
would
not
insist
upon
attend
her
to
her
mother
's
house
,
when
the
Diligence
arrive
at
Brussels
;
and
he
,
cajole
by
her
artifice
,
take
a
formal
leave
of
her
,
together
with
the
other
stranger
,
fix
his
habitation
at
the
inn
to
which
he
and
his
fellow
-
traveller
have
be
direct
,
in
the
impatient
expectation
of
receive
a
kind
summon
from
her
,
within
the
limited

"
SIR
,
if
you
know
what
violence
I
do
my
own
heart
,
in
declare
that
I
have
withdraw
myself
for
ever
from
your

you
would
surely
applaud
the
sacrifice
I
make
to
virtue

and
strive
to
imitate
this
example
of
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Sir
,
heaven
hath
lend
me
grace
to
struggle
with
my
guilty
passion
,
and
henceforth
to
avoid
the
dangerous
sight
of
him
who
inspire
it
.
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
conjure
you
,
by
the
regard
you
ought
to
have
for
the
eternal
welfare
of
us
both
,
as
well
as
by
the
esteem
and
affection
you
profess
,
to
war
with
your
unruly
inclination
,
and
desist
from
all
attempt
of
frustrate
the
laudable
resolution
I
have
make
.
<EOS>
seek
not
to
invade
the
peace
of
one
who
love
you
,
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
a
family
that
never
do
you
wrong
,
and
alienate
the
thought
of
a
weak
woman
from
a
deserve
man
,
who
,
by
the
most
sacred
claim
,
be
vest
  
with
the
full
possession
of
her
heart

"
    
<EOS>
this
billet
,
without
either
date
or
subscription
,
banish
all
remain
of
discretion
from
the
mind
of
our
hero
,
who
run
instantly
to
the
landlord
,
in
all
the
extasy
of
madness
,
and
demand
to
see
the
messenger
who
bring
the
letter
,
on
pain
of
put
his
whole
family
to
the
sword
.
<EOS>
the
innkeeper
,
terrify
by
his
look
and
menace
,
fall
upon
his
knee
,
protest
in
the
face
of
heaven
,
that
he
be
utterly
ignorant
and
innocent
of
any
thing
that
could
give
him
offence
,
and
that
the
billet
be
bring
by
a
person
whom
he
do
not
know
,
and
who
retire
immediately
,
say
,
it
require
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
utterance
to
his
fury
,
in
a
thousand
imprecation
and
invective
against
the
writer
,
whom
he
dishonour
with
the
appellation
of
a
coquette
,
a
jilt
,
an
adventurer
,
who
,
by
mean
of
a
pimp
priest
,
have
defraud
him
of
his
money
.
    
<EOS>
He
denounce
vengeance
against
the
Mendicant
,
whom
he
swear
he
would
castrate
,
if
ever
he
should
set
eye
on
him
again
:
and
the
painter
unluckily
appear
during
this
paroxysm
of
rage
,
he
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
say
he
be
ruin
by
his
accurse
folly
;
and
in
all
likelihood
poor
Pallet
would
have
be
strangle
,
have
not
Jolter
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
beseech
his
pupil
to
have
mercy
upon
the
sufferer
,
and
with
infinite
anxiety
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
this
violent
assault
.
<EOS>
He
receive
no
answer
,
but
a
string
of
incoherent
curse
,
and
when
the
painter
,
with
unspeakable
astonishment
,
take
God
to
witness
,
that
he
have
do
nothing
to
disoblige
him
,
the
governor
begin
to
think
in
sad
earnest
,
that
Peregrine
's
vivacity
have
at
length
rise
to
the
transport
of
actual
madness
,
and
be
himself
almost
distract
with
this
supposition
.
<EOS>
that
he
may
the
well
judge
what
remedy
ought
to
be
apply
,
he
use
his
whole
influence
,
and
practise
all
his
eloquence
upon
the
youth
,
in
order
to
learn
the
immediate
cause
of
his
delirium
.
<EOS>
He
employ
the
most
pathetic
intreatie
,
and
even
shed
tear
in
the
course
of
his
supplication
;
so
that
Pickle
(
the
first
violence
of
the
hurricane
be
blow
over
)
<EOS>
be
ashamed
of
his
own
imprudence
,
and
retire
to
his
chamber
,
in
order
to
recollect
his
dissipate
thought
:
there
he
shut
himself
up
,
and
,
for
the
second
time
,
peruse
the
fatal
epistle
,
begin
to
waver
in
his
opinion
of
the
author
's
character
and
intention
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
consider
her
as
one
of
those
nymph
who
,
under
the
mask
of
innocence
and
simplicity
,
practise
upon
the
heart
and
purse
of
unwary
and
unexperienced
youth
:
this
be
the
suggestion
of
his
wrath
,
inflame
by
disappointment
;
but
,
when
he
reflect
upon
the
circumstance
of
her
behaviour
,
and
recall
her
particular
charm
to
his
imagination
,
the
severity
of
his
censure
give
way
,
and
his
heart
declare
in
favour
of
her
sincerity
.
    
<EOS>
yet
even
this
consideration
aggravate
the
sense
of
his
loss
,
and
he
be
in
danger
of
relapse
into
his
former
distraction
,
when
his
passion
be
a
little
becalm
by
the
hope
of
see
her
again
,
either
by
accident
,
or
in
the
course
of
a
diligent
and
minute
inquiry
,
which
he
forthwith
resolve
to
set
on
foot
.
<EOS>
He
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
her
own
heart
would
espouse
his
cause
,
in
spite
of
her
virtue
's
determination
,
and
do
not
despair
of
meeting
with
the
Capuchin
,
<EOS>
whose
good
office
he
know
he
could
at
any
time
command
.
<EOS>
comfort
with
these
reflexion
,
the
temp
of
his
soul
subside
,
and
in
less
than
two
hour
he
join
his
company
with
an
air
of
composure
,
and
ask
the
painter
's
forgiveness
for
the
freedom
he
have
take
,
the
cause
of
which
he
promise
hereafter
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Pallet
be
glad
of
be
reconcile
on
any
term
to
one
whose
countenance
support
him
in
aequilibrio
with
his
antagonist
the
doctor
;
and
Mr
Jolter
be
rejoice
beyond
measure
at
his
pupil
's
recovery

and
that
the
servant
be
not
the
same
footman
who
have
attend
them
in
France
.
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
information
,
our
hero
order
himself
to
be
drive
close
up
to
that
side
of
their
convenience
on
which
his
old
mistress
sit
,
and
accost
her
with
the
usual
salutation
.
<EOS>
this
lady
no
sooner
beheld
her
gallant
,
than
her
cheek
redden
with
a
double
glow
;
and
she
exclaim
,
"
dear
brother
,
I
be
overjoy'd
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
pray
come
into
our
coach
.
"
<EOS>
He
take
the
hint
immediately
,
and
comply
with
her
request
,
embrace
this
new
sister
with
great
affection
.
    
<EOS>
perceive
that
her
attendant
be
very
much
surprised
and
alarm
at
this
unexpected
meeting
,
she
,
in
order
to
banish
her
suspicion
,
and
at
the
same
time
give
her
lover
his
cue
,
tell
him
that
his
brother
(
mean
her
husband
)
be
go
to
the
Spa
for
a
few
week
,
by
the
advice
of
physician
,
on
account
of
his
ill
state
of
health
;
and
that
,
from
his
last
letter
,
she
have
the
pleasure
to
tell
him
,
he
be
in
a
fair
way
of
do
well
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
express
his
satisfaction
at
this
piece
of
news
,
observe
with
an
air
of
fraternal
concern
,
that
if
his
brother
have
not
make
too
free
with
his
constitution
,
his
friend
in
England
would
have
have
no
occasion
to
repine
at
his
absence
and
want
of
health
,
by
which
he
be
banish
from
his
own
country
and
connexion
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
with
an
affectation
of
surprize
,
why
she
have
not
accompany
her
spouse
?
<EOS>
and
be
give
to
understand
,
that
his
tenderness
of
affection
would
not
suffer
him
to
expose
her
to
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
,
which
lie
among
rock
that
be
almost
inaccessible
.
    
<EOS>
the
duenna
's
doubt
be
ease
by
this
preamble
of
conversation
,
he
change
the
subject
to
the
pleasure
of
the
place
;
and
among
other
such
question
,
inquire
if
she
have
as
yet
visit
Versailles
?
<EOS>
this
be
a
public
house
situate
upon
the
canal
,
at
the
distance
of
about
two
mile
from
town
,
and
accommodate
with
tolerable
garden
for
the
entertainment
of
company
.
<EOS>
when
she
reply
in
the
negative
,
he
propose
to
accompany
her
thither
immediately
;
but
the
governante
,
who
have
hitherto
sat
silent
,
object
to
this
proposal
,
tell
them
,
in
broken
English
,
that
as
the
lady
be
under
her
care
,
she
could
not
answer
to
Mr
Hornbeck
for
allow
her
to
visit
such
a
suspicious
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
for
that
matter
,
Madam
,
(
say
the
confident
gallant
)
give
yourself
no
trouble
,
the
consequence
shall
be
at
my
peril
;
and
I
will
undertake
to
insure
you
against
my
brother
's
resentment
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
direct
the
coachman
to
the
place
,
and
order
his
own
to
follow
,
under
the
auspex
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
while
the
old
gentlewoman
,
over
-
rule
by
his
assurance
,
quietly
submit
to
his
authority
.
    
<EOS>
be
arrive
at
the
place
,
he
hand
the
lady
from
the
coach
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
observe
that
the
duenna
be
lame
,
a
circumstance
of
which
he
do
not
scruple
to
take
the
advantage
;
for
they
have
scarce
alight
,
and
drank
a
glass
of
wine
,
when
he
advise
his
sister
to
enjoy
a
walk
in
the
garden
:
and
although
the
attendant
make
shift
to
keep
them
almost
always
in
view
,
they
enjoy
a
detached
conversation
,
in
which
Peregrine
learn
,
that
the
true
cause
of
her
be
leave
behind
at
Brussels
,
whilst
her
husband
proceed
to
Spa
<EOS>
,
be
his
dread
of
the
company
and
familiarity
of
that
place
,
<EOS>
to
which
his
jealousy
durst
not
expose
her
;
and
that
she
have
live
three
week
in
a
convent
at
Lisle
,
from
which
she
be
deliver
by
his
own
free
motion
,
because
indeed
he
could
no
longer
exist
without
her
company
;
and
lastly
,
our
lover
understand
,
that
her
governante
be
a
mere
dragon
,
who
have
be
recommend
to
him
by
a
spanish
merchant
,
whose
wife
she
attend
to
her
die
day
:
<EOS>
but
she
very
much
question
whether
or
not
her
fidelity
be
proof
enough
against
money
and
strong
water
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
assure
her
the
experiment
should
be
try
before
part
;
and
they
agree
to
pass
the
night
at
Versailles
,
provide
his
endeavour
should
succeed
.
    
<EOS>
have
exercise
themselves
in
this
manner
,
until
his
duenna
's
spirit
be
pretty
much
exhausted
,
that
she
may
be
the
better
dispose
to
recruit
them
with
a
glass
of
liqueur
,
they
return
to
their
apartment
,
and
the
cordial
be
recommend
and
receive
in
a
bumper
:
<EOS>
but
as
it
do
not
produce
such
a
visible
alteration
as
the
sanguine
hope
of
Pickle
have
make
him
expect
,
and
the
old
gentlewoman
observe
that
it
begin
to
be
late
,
and
that
the
gate
would
be
shut
in
a
little
time
,
he
fill
up
a
part
glass
,
and
pledge
her
in
equal
quantity
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
be
too
much
chill
to
be
warm
even
by
this
extraordinary
dose
,
which
make
immediate
innovation
in
the
brain
of
our
youth
,
who
in
the
gaiety
of
his
imagination
overwhelm
this
She
-
argus
with
such
profusion
of
gallantry
,
that
she
be
more
intoxicated
with
his
expression
than
with
the
spirit
she
have
drink
;
and
when
in
the
course
of
toy
he
dropt
a
purse
into
her
bosom
,
she
seem
to
forget
how
the
night
wear
,
and
with
the
approbation
of
her
charge
,
assent
to
his
proposal
of
have
something
for
supper
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
point
which
our
adventurer
have
gain
,
and
yet
he
plainly
perceive
that
the
governante
mistake
his
meaning
,
by
give
herself
credit
for
all
the
passion
he
have
profess
.
<EOS>
as
this
error
could
be
rectify
by
no
other
mean
than
those
of
ply
her
with
the
bottle
,
until
her
distinguish
faculty
should
be
overpower
,
he
promote
a
quick
circulation
,
and
she
do
him
justice
,
without
any
manif
sign
of
inebriation
,
so
long
,
that
his
own
eye
begin
to
reel
in
the
socket
;
and
he
find
,
that
before
his
scheme
could
be
accomplish
,
he
should
be
effectually
unfitted
for
all
the
purpose
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
have
recourse
to
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
understand
the
hint
as
soon
as
it
be
give
,
and
readily
undertake
to
perform
the
part
,
of
which
his
master
have
play'd
<EOS>
the
prelude
.
    
<EOS>
this
affair
be
settle
to
his
satisfaction
,
and
the
night
at
odd
with
morning
,
he
take
an
opportunity
of
impart
to
the
ear
of
this
age
Dulcinea
a
kind
whisper
,
import
a
promise
of
visit
her
,
when
his
sister
should
be
retire
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
an
earnest
desire
of
leave
her
door
unlocked
.
    
<EOS>
this
agreeable
intimation
be
communicate
<EOS>
,
he
convey
a
caution
of
the
same
nature
to
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
as
he
lead
her
to
her
apartment
;
and
darkness
and
silence
no
sooner
prevail
in
the
house
,
than
he
and
his
trusty
squire
set
out
on
their
different
voyage
;
and
every
thing
would
have
succeed
accord
to
their
wish
,
have
not
the
valet
de
chambre
suffer
himself
to
fall
asleep
at
the
side
of
his
inamorata
,
and
in
the
agitation
of
a
violent
dream
,
exclaim
in
a
voice
so
unlike
to
that
of
her
suppose
adorer
,
that
she
distinguish
the
difference
at
once
;
and
wake
him
with
a
pinch
and
a
loud
shriek
,
threaten
to
prosecute
him
for
a
rape
,
and
revile
him
with
all
the
epithet
her
rage
and
disappointment
could
suggest
.
    
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
find
himself
detect
,
behave
with
great
temper
and
address
:
<EOS>
he
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
compose
herself
,
on
account
of
her
own
reputation
,
which
be
extremely
dear
to
him
;
protest
,
that
he
have
a
most
inviolable
esteem
for
her
person
;
and
that
if
he
have
not
already
give
convincing
proof
of
his
passion
,
he
be
dispose
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
for
her
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
these
representation
,
mingle
with
some
little
practical
expression
of
tenderness
,
have
weight
with
the
duenna
,
who
,
upon
recollection
,
comprehend
the
whole
affair
,
and
think
it
would
be
her
interest
to
bring
matter
to
an
accommodation
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
admit
the
apology
of
her
bedfellow
,
provide
he
would
promise
to
atone
by
marriage
for
the
injury
she
have
sustain
;
and
in
this
particular
he
set
her
heart
at
ease
by
repeat
vow
,
which
he
utter
with
surprising
volubility
,
though
without
any
intention
to
perform
the
least
tittle
of
their
content
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
have
be
alarm
by
her
exclamation
,
and
run
to
the
door
with
a
view
of

accord
to
the

of
the
case

foreseeing

that

Chapter
LXIV
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
person
,
however
,
still
ungained
;
and
that
be
no
other
than
her
footman
,
whose
secrecy
our
hero
attempt
to
secure
in
the
morning
by
an
handsome
present
,
which
he
receive
with
many
profession
of
gratitude
and
devotion
to
his
service
;
yet
this
complaisance
be
nothing
but
a
cloak
use
to
disguise
the
design
he
harbour
of
make
his
master
acquaint
with
the
whole
transaction
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
this
lacquey
have
be
hire
,
not
only
as
a
spy
upon
his
mistress
,
but
also
as
a
check
on
the
conduct
of
the
governante
,
with
promise
of
ample
reward
,
if
ever
he
should
discover
any
sinister
or
suspicious
practice
in
the
course
of

of

his
lady

when
her

<EOS>
the

in
consequence
of
the

to
Hornbeck
by
the

as

the
husband
no
room
to
think
he
could
be
any

and
exasperate
him
to
such
a
degree

that
he

and
at
once
disqualify

after

His
fellow

traveller
be
confound
at
his
mysterious
motion
,
which
fill
the
heart
of
Jolter
with
anxiety
and
terror
.
<EOS>
this
careful
conductor
be
fraught
with
such
experience
of
his
pupil
's
disposition
,
that
he
tremble
with
the
apprehension
of
some
sudden
accident
,
and
live
in
continual
alarm
,
like
a
man
that
walk
under
the
wall
of
a
nodding
tower
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
enjoy
any
alleviation
of
his
fear

when
upon
tell
the
young

,
that
the
rest
of
the

be
desirous
of
depart
for
Antwerp
<EOS>
,
he

,
they
be

their
own
inclination
;
but
for
his
own
part
,
he
be
resolve
to
stay
in
Brussels
a

day
longer
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
declaration
,
the
governor
be
confirm
in
the
opinion
of
his

some
intrigue
upon
the

in
the
bitterness
of
his
vexation

take
the
liberty
of
signify
his
suspicion
,
and
remind
him
of
the
dangerous
dilemma
to
which
he
have
be
reduce
by
his
former
precipitation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
take
his
caution
in
good
part
,
and
promise
to
behave
with
such
circumspection
,
as
would
screen
him
from
any
troublesome
consequence
for
the
future
:
but
,
nevertheless
,
behave
that
same
evening
in
such
a
manner
,
as
plainly
shew
,
that
his
prudence
be
nothing
else
than
vain
speculation
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
an
appointment
to
spend
the
night
,
as
usual
,
with
Mrs
Hornbeck
;
and
about
nine
o'clock
hasten
to
her
lodging
,
when
he

without

"
I

if

you
have
make
a
mistake
in
your

<EOS>
I
be
old
enough
to
be
lay
up
,
and
have
wherewithal
to

my

but
this

I

"
    
<EOS>
Startled
at
this
information
,
Peregrine
examine
him
upon
the
particular
of
his
discourse
with
the
lacquey
;
and
when
he
understand
that
Hornbeck
's
intelligence
flow
from
the
canal
of
his
flemish
footman
,
he
believe
every
circumstance
of
Tom

report
,
thank
him
for
this
warning
,
and
after
have
reprimand
him
for
his
misbehaviour
at
Lisle
,
assure
him
that
it
should
be
his
own
fault
if
ever
they
should
part
again
.
<EOS>
He
then
deliberate
with
himself
whether
or
not
he
should
retort
the
purpose
upon
his
adversary
;
but
,
when
he
consider
that
Hornbeck
be
not
the
aggressor
,
and
make
that
unhappy
husband
's
case
his
own
,
he
could
not
help
acquit
his
intention
of
revenge
;
though
,
in
his
opinion
,
it
ought
to
have
be
execute
in
a
more
honourable
manner
;
and
therefore
he
determine
to
chastise
him
for
his
want
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
nothing
surely
can
be
more
insolent
and
unjust
than
this
determination
,
which
induce
him
to
punish
a
person
,
for
his
want
of
courage
to
redress
the
injury
which
he
himself
have
do
to
his
reputation
and
peace
;
and
yet
this
barbarity
of
decision
be
sanction
by
the
opinion
and
practice
of
mankind
.
    
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
he
return
to
the
inn
,
and
put
a
pair
of
pistol
in
his
pocket
,
order
his
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
to
follow
him
at
a
small
distance
,
so
as
that
they
should
be
within
call
,
in
case
of
necessity
,
and
post
himself
within
thirty
yard
of
his
Dulcinea
's
door
.
<EOS>
there
he
have
not
be
above
half
an
hour
,
when
he
perceive
four
man
take
up
their
station
on
the
other
side
,
with
a
view
,
as
he
guess
,
to
watch
for
his
go
in
,
that
he
may
be
take
unaware
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
have
tarry
a
considerable
time
in
that
corner
,
without
reap
the
fruit
of
their
expectation
,
their
leader
,
persuade
that
the
gallant
have
gain
admittance
by
some
secret
mean
,
approach
the
door
with
his
follower
,
who
,
accord
to
the
instruction
they
have
receive
,
no
sooner
see
it
open
,
than
they
rush
in
,
leave
their
employer
in
the
street
,
where
he
think
his
person
would
be
least
endangered
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
see
him
alone
,
advanced
with
speed
,
and
clap
a
pistol
to
his
breast
,
command
him
to
follow
his
footstep
,
without
noise
,
on
pain
of
immediate
death
.
    
<EOS>
Terrified
at
this
sudden
apparition
,
Hornbeck
obey
in
silence
;
and
in
a
few
minute
they
arrive
at
the
quay
,
where
Pickle
halt
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
be
no
stranger
to
his
villainous
design
;
and
tell
him
,
that
if
he
conceive
himself
injure
by
any
circumstance
of
his
conduct
,
he
would
now
give
him
an
opportunity
of
resent
the
wrong
,
in
a
manner
become
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
sword
about
you
,
(
say
he
)
or
if
you
do
not
choose
to
put
the
affair
on
that
issue
,
here
be
a
brace
of
pistol
,
take
which
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
such
an
address
could
not
fail
to
disconcert
a
man
of
his
character
.
    
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
he
in
a
faultering
accent
deny
that
his
design
be
to
mutilate
Mr
Pickle
,
but
that
he
think
himself
intitle
to
the
benefit
of
the
law
,
by
which
he
would
have
obtain
a
divorce
,
if
he
could
have
procure
evidence
of
his
wife
's
infidelity
;
and
with
that
view
have
employ
people
to
take
advantage
of
the
information
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
his
alternative
,
he
decline
it
intirely
,
because
he
could
not
see
what
satisfaction
he
should
enjoy
,
in
be
shoot
through
the
head
,
or
run
through
the
lung
,
by
a
person
who
have
already
wrong
him
in
an
irreparable
manner
;
and
lastly
,
his
fear
make
him
propose
,
that
the
affair
should
be
leave
to
the
arbitration
of
two
creditable
man
,
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
dispute
.
    
<EOS>
to
these
remonstrance
,
Peregrine
reply
,
in
the
stile
of
a
hot
-
head
young
man
,
conscious
of
his
own
unjustifiable
behaviour
,
that
every
gentleman
ought
to
be
a
judge
of
his
own
honour
;
and
therefore
he
would
submit
to
the
decision
of
no
umpire
whatsoever
;
that
he
would
forgive
his
want
of
courage
,
which
may
be
a
natural
infirmity
,
but
his
mean
dissimulation
he
could
not
pardon
;
and
that
,
as
he
be
certify
of
the
rascally
intent
of
his
ambuscade
,
by
undoubted
intelligence
,
he
would
treat
him
,
not
with
a
retaliation
of
his
own
treachery
,
but
with
such
indignity
as
a
scoundrel
deserve
to
suffer
;
unless
he
would
make
one
effort
to
maintain
the
character
he
assume
in
life
:
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
again
present
his
pistol
,
which
be
reject
as
before
,
he
call
his
two
minister
,
and
order
them
to
duck
him
in
the
canal
.
    
<EOS>
this
command
be
pronounce
and
execute
almost
in
the
same
breath
,
to
the
unspeakable
terror
and
disorder
of
the
poor
shivering
patient
,
who
,
have
undergo
the
immersion
,
run
about
like
a
drowned
rat
,
squeak
for
assistance
and
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
His
cry
be
overhear
by
the
patrole
,
which
,
chance
to
pass
that
way
,
take
him
under
their
protection
,
and
,
in
consequence
of
his
complaint
and
information
,
go
in
pursuit
of
our
adventurer
and
his
attendant
,
who
be
soon
overtaken
and
surround
.
<EOS>
rash
and
inconsiderate
as
the
young
gentleman
be
,
he
do
not
pretend
to
stand
upon
the
defensive
,
against
a
file
of
musketeer
,
although
Pipes
have
draw
his
cutlass
at
their
approach

surrender
himself
without

engage
by
his

treat
him
with
all
imaginable
respect

hear
the

assure
him
,
that
the
prince
would
consider
the
whole
as
a
Tour
de

and
order
him
to
be
release
without

<EOS>
Next
morning
,
when
this

give
in
his
report
,
he
make
such
a
favourable
representation
of
the
prisoner
,
that
our
hero
be
on
the
point

discharge

when
Hornbeck
prefer
a
complaint

accuse
him
of
a
purposed
assassination

and
pray
that
such
punishment

inflict
upon

as

nature

the

perplex
with
this
petition
,
in

of
which
he
foresee
,
that
he
must
disoblige
a
british
subject

send
for
the
plaintiff

of
whom
he
have
some
knowledge

and
in
person
exhort
him
to
drop
the
prosecution

which
would
only
serve
to
propagate
his
own
shame

<EOS>
but
Hornbeck
be
too
much
incensed
to
listen
to
any
proposal
of
that
kind
,
and
peremptorily
demand
justice
against
the
prisoner
,
whom
he
represent
as
an
obscure
adventurer
,
who
have
make
repeat
attempt
upon
his

<EOS>
Prince
Charles
tell
him
,
that
what
he
have
advise
be
in
the
capacity
of
a
friend
,
but
,
since
he
insist
upon
his
acting
as
a
magistrate
,
the
affair
should
be
examine
,
and
determine
accord
to
the
dictate

the
petitioner
be
dismiss

the
defendant
be
in
his
turn
bring
before
<EOS>
the
judge
,
whose
prepossession
in

be
in

Chapter
LXV
   
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
understand
from
some
expression
which
escape
the
prince
,
that
he
be
consider
in
the
light
of
a
sharper
and
assassin
,
beg
that
he
may
have
the
liberty
of
send
for
some
voucher
,
that
would
probably
vindicate
his
character
from
the
malicious
aspersion
of
his
adversary
;
and
this
permission
be
grant
,
he
write
a
letter
to
his
governor
,
desire
that
he
would
bring
to
him
the
letter
of
recommendation
which
he
have
receive
from
the
british
embassador
at
Paris
,
and
such
other
paper
as
he
think
conducive
to
evince
the
importance
of
his
situation
.
    
<EOS>
the
billet
be
give
in
charge
to
one
of
the
subaltern
officer
on
duty
,
who
carry
it
to
the
inn
,
and
demand
to
speak
with
Mr
Jolter
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
,
who
happen
to
be
at
the
door
,
when
this
messenger
arrive
,
and
hear
him
enquire
for
the
tutor
,
run
directly
to
that
gentleman
's
apartment
,
and
in
manifest
disorder
tell
him
,
that
a
huge
fellow
of
a
soldier
,
with
a
monstrous
pair
of
whisker
,
and
a
fur
-
cap
as
big
as
a
bushel
,
be
ask
for
him
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
poor
governor
begin
to
shake
at
this
intimation
,
though
he
be
not
conscious
of
have
commit
any
thing
that
could
attract
the
attention
of
the
state
;
and
,
when
the
officer
appear
at
his
chamber
-
door
,
his
confusion
increase
to
such
a
degree
,
that
his
perception
seem
to
vanish
,
and
the
subaltern
repeat
the
purport
of
his
errand
three
time
,
before
he
could
comprehend
his
meaning
,
or
venture
to
receive
the
letter
which
he
present
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
summon
all
his
fortitude
,
and
have
peruse
the
epistle
,
his
terror
sink
into
anxiety
;
his
ingenious
fear
immediately
suggest
,
that
Peregrine
be
confine
in
a
dungeon
,
for
some
outrage
he
have
commit
;
he
run
with
great
agitation
to
a
trunk
,
and
take
out
a
bundle
of
paper
,
follow
his
conductor
,
be
attend
by
the
painter
,
to
whom
he
have
hint
his
apprehension
.
<EOS>
when
they
pass
through
the
guard
,
which
be
under
arm
,
the
heart
of
both
die
within
them
;
and
when
they
come
into
the
presence
,
there
be
such
an
expression
of
awful
horror
on
the
countenance
of
Jolter
,
that
the
prince
,
observe
his
dismay
,
be
pleased
to
encourage
him
with
an
assurance
,
that
he
have
nothing
to
fear
.
    
<EOS>
thus
comfort
,
he
recollect
himself
so
well
as
to
understand
his
pupil
,
when
he
desire
him
to
produce
the
Embassador
's
letter
;
some
of
which
be
open
,
be
immediately
read
by
his
highness
,
who
be
personally
acquaint
with
the
writer
,
and
know
several
of
the
nobleman
to
whom
they
be
address
.
<EOS>
these
recommendation
be
so
warm
,
and
represent
the
young
gentleman
in
such
an
advantageous
light
,
that
the
prince
,
convince
of
the
injustice
his
character
have
suffer
by
the
misrepresentation
of
Hornbeck
,
take
our
hero
by
the
hand
,
ask
pardon
for
the
doubt
he
have
entertain
of
his
honour
,
declare
him
from
that
moment
at
liberty
,
order
his
domestick
to
be
enlarge
,
and
offer
him
his
countenance
and
protection
,
as
long
as
he
should
remain
in
the
Austrian
Netherlands
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
caution
him
against
indiscretion
in
the
course
of
his
gallantry
;
and
take
his
word
and
honour
,
that
he
should
drop
all
measure
of
resentment
against
the
person
of
Hornbeck
,
during
his
residence
in
that
place
.
    
<EOS>
the
delinquent
,
thus
honourably
acquit
,
thank
the
prince
in
the
most
respectful
manner
,
for
his
generosity
and
candour
,
and
retire
with
his
two
friend
,
who
be
amazed
and
bewilder
in
their
thought
,
at
what
they
have
see
and
hear
,
the
whole
adventure
still
remain
without
the
sphere
of
their
comprehension

which
be
not

all

by
the
unaccountable
appearance
of
Pipes
,
who
,
with
the
valet
de
chambre
,
join
them
at
the
castle
-
gate
.
<EOS>
have
Jolter
be
a
man
of
a
luxuriant
imagination
,
his
brain
would
undoubtedly
have
suffer
in
the
investigation
of
his
pupil
's
mysterious
conduct
,
which
he
strove
in
vain
to
unravel
;
but
his
intellect
be
too
solid
to
be
affect
by
the
miscarriage
of
his
invention
;
and
as
Peregrine
do
not
think
proper
to
make
him
acquaint
with
the
cause
of
his
be
apprehend
,
he
content
himself
with
supposing
,
that
there
be
a
lady
in
the
case
.
    
<EOS>
the
painter
,
whose
imagination
be
of
a
more
flimsy
texture
,
form
a
thousand
chimerical
conjecture
,
which
he
communicate
to
Pickle
,
in
imperfect
insinuation
,
hope
,
by
his
answer
and
behaviour
,
to
discover
the
truth
;
but
the
youth
,
in
order
to
tantalize
him
,
elude
all
his
enquiry
,
with
such
appearance
of
industry
and
art
,
as
heighten
his
curiosity
,
while
it
disappoint
his
aim
,
and
inflame
him
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
his
wit
begin
to
be
unsettle
,
and
Peregrine
be
fain
to
recompose
his
brain
,
by
tell
him
in
confidence
,
that
he
have
be
arrest
as
a
spy
.
<EOS>
this
secret
he
find
more
intolerable
than
his
former
uncertainty
;
he
run
from
one
apartment
to
another
,
like
a
goose
in
the
agony
of
egg
-
lay
,
with
intention
of
disburden
this
important
load
;
but
,
Jolter
be
engage
with
his
pupil
,
and
all
the
people
of
the
house
ignorant
of
the
only
language
he
could
speak
,
he
be
compel
,
with
infinite
reluctance
,
to
address
himself
to
the
doctor
,
who
be
,
at
that
time
,
shut
up
in
his
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
have
knock
at
the
door
,
to
no
purpose
,
he
peep
through
the
key
-
hole
,
and
see
the
physician
sit
at
a
table
,
with
a
pen
in
one
hand
,
and
paper
before
him
,
his
head
recline
upon
his
other
hand
,
and
his
eye
fix
upon
the
ceiling
,
as
if
he
have
be
intrance
.
<EOS>
Pallet
,
conclude
that
he
be
under
the
power
of
some
convulsion
,
endeavour
to
force
the
door
open
,
and
the
noise
of
his
effort
recall
the
doctor
from
his
reverie
.
    
<EOS>
this
poetical
republican
,
be
so
disagreeably
disturbed
,
start
up
in
a
passion
,
and
open
the
door
,
no
sooner
perceive
who
have
interrupt
him
,
than
he
fling
it
in
his
face
with
great
fury
,
and
curse
him
for
his
impertinent
intrusion
,
which
have
deprive
him
of
the
most
delightful
vision
that
ever
regale
the
human
fancy
.
<EOS>
He
imagine
,
(
as
he
afterwards
impart
to
Peregrine
)
<EOS>
that
as
he
enjoy
himself
in
walk
though
the
flowery
plain
that
border
on
Parnassus
,
he
be
meet
by
a
venerable
sage
,
whom
,
by
a
certain
divine
vivacity
that
lighten
from
his
eye
,
he
instantly
know
to
be
the
immortal
Pindar
.
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
strike
with
reverence
and
awe
,
and
prostrate
himself
before
the
apparition
,
which
take
him
by
the
hand
,
lift
him
gently
from
the
ground
;
and
with
word
more
sweet
than
the
honey
of
the
Hybla
bee
,
tell
him
,
that
of
all
the
modern
,
he
alone
be
visit
by
that
celestial
impulse
by
which
himself
have
be
inspire
,
when
he
produce
his
most
applaud
ode
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
lead
him
up
the
sacred
hill
,
persuade
him
to
drink
a
copious
draught
of
the
water
of
the
Hippocrene
,
and
then
present
him
to
the
harmonious
nine
,
who
crown
his
temple
with
a
laurel
-
wreath
.
    
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
he
be

to
find
himself
cut
off
from
such
sublime
society

<EOS>
He
rave
in
Greek
against
the
invader
,
who
be
so
big
with
his
own
purpose
,
that
,
unmindful
of
the
disgrace
he
have
sustain
,
and
disregard
all
the
symptom
of
the
physician
's
displeasure
,
he
apply
his
mouth
to
the

and
in
eager
tone
,
"
I
will
hold
you
any
wager
(
say
he
)
that
I
guess
the
true
cause
of
Mr
Pickle
's
imprisonment
.
"
    
<EOS>
to
this
challenge
he
receive
no
reply
;
and
therefore
repeat
it
,
add
,
"
I
suppose
you
imagine
he
be
take
up
for
fight
a
duel
,
or
affront
a
nobleman
,
or
lie
with
some
man

or
some
such

;
but
,
agad
!
<EOS>
you
be
never
more
mistaken
in
your
life
;
and
I
will
lay
my
Cleopatra
against
your
homer
's
head
,
that
in

twenty
hour
you
shall
not
light
on

<EOS>
the

of

exasperate
at
this
vexatious
perseverance
of
the
painter
,
who
he
imagine
have
come
thither
to
teize
and
insult
him
,
"
I
would
(
say
he
)
sacrifice
a
cock
to
Aesculapius
,
<EOS>
be
I
assure
that
any
person
have
be
take
up
for
extirpate
such
a
troublesome
Goth
as
you
be
from

face
of
the

and
as
for
your
boasted
Cleopatra
,
which
you
say
be
draw
from
your
own

I
believe
the
copy
have
as
much
of
the

the
original

<EOS>

,
be
it
mine
,
it
should
be
hang
up
in
the
temple

Cloacina

as
the
picture
of
that
goddess
;
for
any
other
apartment
would
be

Hark
ye
,
Sir
,
(
replied
Pallet
,
enrage
in
his
turn
at
this
contemptuous
mention
of
his
darling
performance
)
you
may
make
as
free
with
my
wife
as
you
think
proper
;
but
'
ware
my
work
,
those
be
the
child
of
my
fancy
,
conceive
by
the
glowing
imagination
,
and
form
by
the
art
of
my
own
hand
:
and
you
yourself
be
a
Goth
,
and
a
Turk
,
and
a
Tartar
,
and
an
impudent
pretend
jackanape
,
to
treat
with
such
disrespect
a
production
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
connoisseur
of
the
age
,
will
,
when
finish
,
be
a
master
-
piece
in
its
kind
,
and
do
honour
to
human
genius
and
skill
.
    
<EOS>
so
I
say
again
and
again
,
<EOS>
(
and
I
care
not
though
your
friend
Playtor
hear
me
)
that
you
have
no
more
taste
than
a
drayman
's
horse
,
and
that
those
foolish
notion
of
the
ancient
ought
to
be
drubb'd
out
of
you
with
a
good
cudgel
,
that
you
may
learn
to
treat
man
of
part
with
more
veneration
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
not
always
be
in
the
company
of
one
who
will
hollow
for
assistance
,
when
you
be
on
the
brink
of
be
chastise
for
your
insolence
,
as
I
do
,
when
you
bring
upon
yourself
the
resentment
of
that
Scot
,
who
,
by
the
Lard
!
<EOS>
would
have
pay
you
both
scot
and
lot
,
as
Falstaf
say
,
if
the
french
officer
have
not
put
him
in

"
    
<EOS>
the
physician
to
this
declamation
,
which
be
convey
through
the
key
-
hole
,
answer
,
that
he
(
the
painter
)
be
a
fellow
so
infinitely
below
his
consideration
,
that
his
conscience
upbraid
him
with
no
action
of
his
life
,
except
that
of
choose
such
a
wretch
for
his
companion
and
fellow
-
traveller
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
view
his
character
through
the
medium
of
good
nature
and
compassion
,
which
have
prompt
him
to
give
Pallet
an
opportunity
of
acquire
some
new
idea
under
his
immediate
instruction
;
but
he
have
abuse
his
goodness
and
condescension
in
such
a
flagrant
manner
,
that
he
be
now
determine
to
discard
him
intirely
from
his
acquaintance
,
and
desire
him
,
for
the
present
,
to
take
himself
away
,
on
pain
of
be
kick
for
his
presumption
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
be
too
much
incensed
to
be
intimidate
by
this
threat
,
which
he
retort
with
great
virulence
,
defy
him
to
come
forth
,
that
it
may
appear
which
of
them
be
best
skilled
in
that
pedestrian
exercise
which
he
immediately
begin
to
practise
against
the
door
with
such
thundering
application
,
as
reach
the
ear
of
Pickle
and
his
governor
,
who
come
out
into
the
passage
,
and
see
him
thus
employ
,
ask
if
he
have
forget
the
chamber
-
pot
of
Alost
,
that
he
venture
to
behave
in
such
a
manner
,
as
intitle
him
to
a
second
prescription
of
the
same
nature
.
    
<EOS>
the
doctor
understanding
that
there
be
company
at
hand
,
open
the
door
in
a
twinkling
,
and
spring
upon
his
antagonist
,
like
a
tyger
,
a
fierce
contention
would
have
ensue
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
our

have
not
Jolter

to
the
manif
peril
of
his
own

interpose

and
partly
by
force
,
and
partly
by
exhortation
,
put
a
stop
to
the
engagement
before
it
be
fairly
begin
.
<EOS>
after
have
demonstrate
the
indecency
of
such
a
vulgar
rencounter
betwixt
two
fellow

citizen
in
a
foreign
land
,
he
begg'd
to
know
the
cause
of
their
dissention
,
and
offer
his
good
office
towards
an
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
also
,
see
the
fray
be
finish
,
express
himself
to
the
same
purpose
;
and
the
painter
,
for
obvious
reason
,
decline
an
explanation
,
his
antagonist
tell
the
youth
what
a
mortifying
interruption
he
have
suffer
by
the
impertinent
intrusion
of
Pallet
,
and
give
him
a
detail
of
the
particular
of
his
vision
,
as
above
recite
.
<EOS>
the
arbiter
own
,
the
provocation
be
not
to
be
endure
,
and
decreed
,
that
the
offender
should
make
some
atonement
for
his
transgression
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
painter
observe
,
that
howsoever
he
may
have
be
dispose
to
make
acknowledgment
,
if
the
physician
have
signify
his
displeasure
like
a
gentleman
,
the
complainant
have
now
forfeit
all
claim
to
any
such
concession
,
by
the
vulgar
manner
in
which
he
have
revile
him
and
his
production
;
observe
,
that
if
he
(
the
painter
)
have
be
incline
to
retort
his
slanderous
insinuation
,
the
republican
's
own
work
would
have
afford
ample
subject
for
his
ridicule
and
censure
.
    
<EOS>
after

be
at

conclude
,
on
condition
,
that
for
the
future
the

should
never
mention
Cleopatra
,
unless
he
could

something
in

praise
;
and
that
Pallet
,
in
consideration
of
his
have

the
first

,
should
make
a
sketch
of

LXVI
Peregrine

his
inquiry
about
his

Amanda
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
be
engage
in
an
intrigue
with
a
nun
,
which

strange
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
though
this
treaty
be
conclude
at
the
instance
of
Peregrine
and
his
governor
,
it
be
impossible
that
a
last
friendship
could
subsist
between
the
two
party
,
because
they
entertain
for
each
other
the
most
perfect
contempt
,
which

in
the
course
of
their
communication
,
could
not

daily
food
for
animosity
and
aversion

<EOS>
Our
adventurer
's
next
care
be
to
exercise
all
his
diligence
and
invention
to
find
his
lose
Amanda
,
who
,
now
that
he
be
detach
from
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
resume
the
full
possession
of
his
thought
.
<EOS>
as
she
would
never
tell
him
her
own
name
,
or
that
of
her
mother
,
his
inquiry
be
direct
by
a
personal
description
only
;
and
that
,
in
such
a
populous
city
as
Brussels
,
could
tend
but
very
little
to
his
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
He
not
only
order
his
valet
de
chambre
to
exert
his
whole
address
,
in
order
to
discover
the
place
of
her
abode
,
but
this
dexterous

,
who
be
very
well
acquaint
in
that
city
,
retain
half
a
dozen
of
note
pimp
for
the
same
purpose
,
who
be
direct
to
employ
their
research
for
a
very
handsome
young
lady
,
of
the
middle
stature
,
with
fine
black

,
and

as

<EOS>
the

give
to

of
gallantry

in
a
good

several
lady
in

,
whom
Peregrine
find
mean
to
see
,
in
consequence
of
the
report
he
have
receive
;
but
he
could
not
recognize
his
dear
fellow
-
traveller
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
at
last
one
of
his
terrier
give
the
valet
de
chambre
to
understand
,
that
at
the
grate
of
a
certain
nunnery
,
he
have
observe
a
beautiful
young
creature
,
who
resemble
the
picture
he
have

,
and
that
upon

,
he
find
she
have
not
take
the

;
but
her
mother
be
lately
dead
,
have
enter
as
a
pensionaire
,
until
her

affair
could
be
adjust
.
    
<EOS>
this
piece
of
intelligence
be
no
sooner
communicate
to
our
hero
,
than
he
fly
in
the
utmost
impatience
to
the
nunnery
,
and
,
without
allow
himself
to
believe
that
this
boarder
could
be
any
other
than
the
object
of
his
pursuit
,
desire
the
portress
to
tell
the
young
lady
who
be
lately
admit
,
that
one
of
her
relation
begg'd
to
speak
with
her
at
the
grate
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
not
wait
five
minute
,
when
this
nymph
appear
;
and
though
he
find
his
expectation
disappoint
,
he
be
so
strike
with
the
charm
of
this
new
figure
,
that
his
heart
throb
when
she
approach
;
and
after
he
have
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
have
take
,
and
explain
the
nature
of
his
mistake
,
he
could
not
help
tell
her
,
that
he
think
himself
fortunate
in
the
misinformation
he
have
receive
,
since
it
be
attend
with
the
pleasure
of
see
such
an
amiable
young

<EOS>
to
this
compliment
she
reply
with
great
spirit
and
good
humour
,
that
encourage
the
youth
to
continue
the
conversation
,
during
which

and
when
,
for
the
sake
of

and
the
knowledge

return
to
his

in
full
confidence
of
bring
this
intrigue
to
a
prosperous
issue

<EOS>
nor
have
the
young
gentleman
in
this
case
overrate
his
own
success
:
the
lady
happen
to
be
of
a
very
amorous
complexion
,
and
her
passion
be
inflame
rather
than
mortify
,
by
the
restraint
in
which
she
live
,
she
be
captivate
by
the
person
of
Peregrine
,
and
his
insinuate
address
have
confirm
his
conquest
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
fail
to
be
at
the
grate
next
day
,
where
he
urge
his
suit
with
such
irresistible
recommendation
,
that
she
confess
a
mutual
flame
,
after
have
observe
,
that
the
circumstance
of
her
situation
would
not
permit
her
to
protract
that
acknowledgment
in
the
usual
form

<EOS>
He
receive
this
confession
with
transport
,
as
the
effusion
of
an
ingenuous
mind
,
that
soar
above
all
the
little
art
and
disguise
of
the
sex

and
intreate
her
to
tell
him
when
or
where
he
should
have
the
happiness
of
converse
with
her
,
without
the
interposition
of
these
invidious
bar
.
    
<EOS>
She
give
him
to
understand
,
that
as
her
friend
have
put
her
under
the
direction
of
a
severe
abbess
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
go
abroad
without
the
connivance
of
the
portress
,
and
equally
impracticable
for
him
to
gain
admittance
into
the
convent
,
without
run
a
manif
risk
of
be
discover
,
and
consequently
punish
with
the
utmost
severity
.
    
<EOS>
when
a
fair
lady
be
in
the
case
,
our
adventurer
despise
all
danger
,
and
spare
no
expence
.
<EOS>
thus
inform
,
he
study
the
disposition
of
the
old
sister
who
keep
the
key
;
and
in
her
appearance
and
conversation
,
distinguish
the
implacable
rancour
of
a
woman
who
have
spend
her
youth
in
all
the
mortification
of
detest
celibacy
.
<EOS>
She
bear
a
most
inveterate
grudge
to
all
her
junior
,
who
still
remain
within
the
possibility
of
enjoy
those
pleasure
from
which
she
be
eternally
cut
off
,
and
observe
all
the
young
man
who
appear
at
the
grate
with
the
most
envious
suspicion
.
<EOS>
not
even
the
power
of
all

persuade
gold
could
tame
the
spite
,
or
soften
the
vigilant
asperity
of
this
indomitable
maiden
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
tamper
with
her
in
vain
;
nay
,
she
threaten
to
inform
the
abbess
of
his
sacrilegious
attempt
,
that
he
may
,
for
the
future
,
be
exclude
from
the
privilege
of
speak
to
the
nun
:
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
find
the

of
corruption
ineffectual
.
    
<EOS>
baffle
in
this
endeavour

he
confer
with
his
mistress
about
some
other
mean
of
procure
an
unrestricted
interview
;
and
she
,
in
the
fertility
of
her
invention
,
propose

that
he
should
make
it
his
business
to
find
some

who

by

would
introduce

in
a
female
dress
,
as

stranger
desirous

.
<EOS>
the
expedient

gallant

who
have
immediate
recourse

assistance
of
his
valet
de
chambre

by
whom
he
be

make
acquaint
with
a
certain
good
-
natured
gentlewoman
,
who
,
for
an
handsome
consideration

undertake
the
task
.
<EOS>
from

good

wardrobe
he
be
accordingly
accommodate
with
a
proper
suit
,
which
,
on
account
of

,
be
piece
for
the
purpose
:
and
his
mistress

though
the

and
a
pair
of
artificial
eye

brow
,
screen
him
from
the
penetrate
eye

there
be
something

remarkably
singular
in

stature

countenance
and
mien
,
that
the
sister
gaze
upon
him
as
a
prodigy
;
and
he
could
hear
them
,
as
he
pass
,
ask
of
each
other
,
with
expression
of
astonishment
,
if
all
the
woman
in
England
make
such
a
strange
appearance
.
    
<EOS>
have
visit
the
cell
and
chapel
,
his
charmer
officiously
offer
her
service
in
conduct
the
stranger
to
the
garden
;
and
after
have
attend
them
in
walk
several
turn
,
invite
them
to
repose
in
a
small
arbour
,
that
stand
at
one
corner
,
in
the
middle
of
a
tuft
of
tree
,
which
render
it
impervious
to
the
view
.
    
<EOS>
the
old
gentlewoman
understand
the
hint
,
accompany
the
lover
to
the
entrance
of
this
grove
,
where
she
leave
them
,
on
pretence
of
be
still
unwearied
with
the
exercise
of
her
leg
;
and
their
mutual
rapture
in
this
steal
interview
begin
to
rise
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
,
when
they
be
alarm
by
the
rustling
of
the
leave
behind
them
;
and
turn
their
eye
towards
the
place
,
perceive
they
be
discover
by
a
nun
,
who
,
either
by
accident
or
design
,
have
conceal
herself
in
the
thicket
,
until
,
scandalize
by
their
behaviour
<EOS>
,
she
think
it
high
time
to
signify
her
presence
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
doubt
that
our
hero
and
his
mistress
be
grievously
disconcert
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
lady
cry
she
be
undone
,
and
have
almost
faint
with
fear
,
which
be
not
at
all
without
foundation
,
consider
that
not
only
her
reputation
,
but
even
her
life
be
at
stake
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
could
easily
have
make
his
escape
over
the
garden
-
wall
,
have
too
much
gallantry
to
leave
his
charmer
and
friend
in
such
a
dangerous
dilemma
;
and
therefore
,
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
,
advance
to
the
author
of
his
perplexity
,
and
without
any
ceremony
or
courtship
,
find
mean
to
make
her
a
party
in
the
secret
,
before
she
could
recollect
herself
so
far
as
to
find
fault
with
his
proceeding
.
    
<EOS>
this
measure
re
-
establish
the
tranquillity
of
the
scene
:
the
two
lady
embrace
as
sister
,
and
vow
eternal
friendship
on
the
spot
;
and
the
young
gentleman
have
protest
that
he
would
share
his
affection
between
them
,
and
practise
the
same
method
of
visit
them
in
a
few
day
,
rejoin
his
directress
,
and
return
in
safety
to
his
own
lodging
,
be
but
indifferently
satisfied
with
the
adventure
of
the
day
,
by
which
he
find
himself
oblige
,
either
to
forego
all
correspondence
with
the
woman
he
love
,
or
carry
on
an
intrigue
with
a
person
who
be
not
at
all
to
his
liking
;
for
the
attraction
of
the
nun
be
by
no
mean
inchante
.
    
<EOS>
He
next
day
appear
at
the
grate
in
his
own
person
,
and
intimate
his
sentiment
on
this
subject
to
his
mistress
,
who
assure
him
,
that
notwithstanding
her
behaviour
to
the
sister
,
in
the
emergency
of
yesterday
,
she
would
much
rather
be
debar
of
his
company
for
ever
,
than
enjoy
it
upon
the
term
which
necessity
have
oblige
him
to
propose
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
the
reflection
on
what
have
pass
in
the
grove
,
have
inspire
her
with
such
an
unconquerable
aversion
for
that
accidental
rival
,
that
she
could
not
think
of
her
without
hate
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
She
wish
she
have
run
all
risk
,
rather
than
submit
to
such
detest
partition
;
and
vow
with
great
warmth
,
that
let
the
consequence
be
what
it
would
,
she
be
determined
to
discover
the
whole
affair
to
the
abbess
,
if
ever
he
should
introduce
himself
again
,
in
a
manner
which
must
subject
him
to
the
knowledge
and
claim
of
her
competitor
.
    
<EOS>
He
applaud
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiment
,
which
he
swear
be
exactly
conformable
to
his
own
;
and
promise
to
desist
from
those
visit
that
give
her
umbrage
,
encourage
her
to
hope
,
that
they
would
find
some
other
mean
of
settle
an
intercourse
,
in
which
she
should
ingross
his
undivided
attention
.
<EOS>
such
a
scheme
be
actually
the
subject
of
his
thought
at
that
time
;
and
a
youth
of
his
fruitful
imagination
,
assist
with
the
counsel
of
such
a
consummate
politician
as
the
valet
de
chambre
,
would
undoubtedly
have
bring
it
to
maturation
,
have
not
his
aim
be
anticipate
by
an
unforeseen
accident
,
that
flow
from
the
partial
administration
of
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
the
nun
who
have
be
indebte
to
chance
for
his
address
,
be
too
conscious
of
her
own
inferior
qualification
,
to
think
she
could
dispute
the
heart
of
our
hero
with
the
young
lady
who
be
previously
possess
of
his
affection
;
she
know
,
that
her
share
of
his
good
grace
be
altogether
casual
,
and
that
the
continuance
of
his
assiduity
must
be
the
effect
of
policy
and
constrain
complaisance
;
yet
,
even
on
these
consideration
,
they
be
too
agreeable
to
be
give
up
;
and
therefore
she
resolve
to
guard
her
privilege
with
the
most
minute
vigilance
and
caution
.
<EOS>
jealousy
be
the
natural
consequence
of
these
suggestion
:
the
assignation
in
the
garden
,
she
know
,
must
have
be
precede
by
some
communication
;
and
as
there
be
no
other
opportunity
of
converse
with
the
male
sex
,
except
that
of
hold
a
conference
through
the
grate
,
she
go
to
the
portress
,
with
a
view
of
obtain
some
intelligence
;
and
pump
the
beldame
so
successfully
,
that
she
learn
how
her
rival
have
that
very
forenoon
be
favour
with
a
visit
by
a
young
gentleman
,
whom
she
suppose
to
be
no
other
than
their
common
gallant
.
<EOS>
inflame
with
this
information
,
she
tax
the
young
lady
with
double
dealing
;
and
scold
with
such
bitterness
,
that
the
other
,
already
prejudice
against
her
pretension
,
could
no
longer
contain
her
resentment
,
which
she
utter
in
contemptuous
sneer
against
her
personal
attribute
;
and
in
the
pride
of
her
wrath
declare
,
that
she
ought
not
to
expect
another
interview
with
her
lover
in
the
grove
;
for
he
be
already
too
much
satiate
with
her
charm
to
return
to
such
a
banquet
,
and
have
relinquish
her
to
the
chance
of
meet
with
another
charitable
meal
.
    
<EOS>
no
tygress
rob
of
her
young
be
ever
exalt
to
an
high
pitch
of
fury
than
this
nun
,
when
she
find
herself
abandon
by
her
lover
,
and
insult
in
this
mortifying
explanation
.
<EOS>
She
dart
upon
her
antagonist
,
like
a
hawk
upon
a
partridge
,
and
with
her
nail
disfigure
that
fair
face
which
have
defraud
her
of
her
dear
expectation
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
rival
tamely
bear
the
barbarity
of
her
rage
;
what
she
want
in
strength
she
supply
with
spirit
,
and
twist
her
hand
in
the
hair
of
the
aggressor
,
pull
her
head
with
violence
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
noise
of
this
contention
,
increase
by
the
cry
of
the
combatant
,
whose
tongue
be
more
active
than
their
hand
,
bring
a
croud
of
sister
to
the
spot
;
but
so
fiercely
be
they
engage
,
that
they
neither
minded
admonition
nor
threat
,
nor
pay
the
least
regard
to
their
own
reputation
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
as
if
they
have
not
know
that
they
be
surround
by
number
,
who
hear
every
word
that
proceed
from
their
mouth
,
they
make
no
secret
of
the
cause
of
their
dispute
,
which
,
in
the
precipitancy
of
their
wrath
,
they
divulge
with
all
its
circumstance
,
to
the
amazement
of
the
by

stander
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
the
lady
abbess
arrive
,
and
what
her
authority
could
not
accomplish
,
be
effect
by
two
lay
-
sister
,
who
be
summon
for
the
purpose
,
separate
the
rival
,
who
be
by
this
time
quite
exhausted
with
the
fatigue
of
the
battle
.
<EOS>
have
this
mutual
detection
be
make
in
any
company
of
female
,
the
secret
would
have
hardly
rest
among
those
who
hear
it
,
much
less
in
a
convent
,
where
so
many
old
maiden
happen
to
be
present
.
    
<EOS>
one
of
these
antiquated
devotee
accordingly
impart
it
to
the
superior
,
who
have
examine
into
the
particular
,
and
find
the
information
true
,
from
the
rash
recrimination
of
the
incensed
party
on
their
trial
,
consider
the
affair
as
a
very
serious
matter
,
which
affect
the
good
order
and
reputation
of
her
convent
,
assemble
all
the
sister
,
and
exhort
them
to
suppress
the
discovery
,
as
a
circumstance
injurious
to
the
character
of
the
house
;
lay
strict
injunction
on
the
portress
,
to
be
very
cautious
for
the
future
in
the
discharge
of
her
office
,
deliver
over
the
backslide
nun
to
a
severe
penance
prescribe
by
her
ghostly
father
,
and
that
very
day
send
her
boarder
back
to
her
relation
,
with
a
hint
of
what
have
happen
,
and
an
advice
to
dispose
of
her
in
some
remote
nunnery
,
where
she
would
be
less
expose
to
the
machination
of
her
gallant
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
,
utterly
ignorant
of
this
unlucky
fray
and
its
consequence
,
be
confound
when
the
wrinkle
turnkey
refuse
to
admit
him
to
the
grate
,
tell
him
,
that
his
impious
contrivance
have
come
to
light
;
that
the
lewd
young
woman
,
for
whose
sake
he
have
be
guilty
of
such
a
flagrant
crime
,
be
banish
from
the
convent
;
and
that
if
ever
he
should
make
another
attempt
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
their
retreat
,
a
formal
complaint
would
be
prefer
against
him
to
the
civil
magistrate
.
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
with
this
reception
<EOS>
,
he
do
not
think
proper
to
advance
any
thing
in
his
own
vindication
,
but
retreat
with
all
convenient
dispatch
,
not
ill
pleased
at
the
issue
of
an
adventure
which
may
have
prove
not
only
disagreeable
,
but
dangerous
in
the
high
degree
.
    
<EOS>
He
at
once
conjecture
,
that
the
mutual
jealousy
of
the
lady
have
betray
the
intrigue
;
and
imagine
,
that
now
his
charmer
be
deliver
from
the
restriction
of
a
convent
,
she
would
be
more
accessible
to
his
endeavour
.
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
,
he
send
his
courier
upon
the
scout
;
and
as
he
know
her
name
,
it
be
not
long
before
he
learn
,
from
their
artful
inquiry
,
that
immediately
after
her
dismission
from
one
nunnery
,
she
have
be
enter
in
another
at
Ghent
,
in
consequence
of
the
superior
's
advice
,
and
in
all
likelihood
would
be
compel
to
take
the
veil
by
her
guardian
,
who
be
remarkably
zealous
for
the
welfare
of
her
soul

Chapter
LXVII
<EOS>
the
traveller
depart
for
Antwerp
,
at
which
place
the
painter
give
a
loose
to
his
enthusiasm
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
thus
deprive
of
an
agreeable
correspondence
,
and
baffle
in
all
his
effort
to
retrieve
the
other
object
of
his
passion
,
yield
at
length
to
the
remonstrance
of
his
governor
and
fellow
-
traveller
,
who
,
out
of
pure
complaisance
to
him
,
have
exceed
their
intend
stay
by
six
day
at
least
:
and
a
couple
of
post
-
chaise
,
with
three
riding
-
horse
,
be
hire
,
they
depart
from
Brussels
in
the
morning
,
dine
at
Mechlin
,
and
arrive
about
eight
in
the
evening
at
the
venerable
city
of
Antwerp
.
<EOS>
during
this
day
's
journey
,
Pallet
be
elevate
to
an
uncommon
flow
of
spirit
,
with
the
prospect
of
see
the
birth
place
of
Rubens
,
for
whom
he
profess
an
enthusiastic
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
He
swear
,
that
the
pleasure
he
feel
be
equal
to
that
of
a
Mussulman
,
on
the
last
day
of
his
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
;
and
that
he
already
consider
himself
a
native
of
Antwerp
,
be
so
intimately
acqainted
with
their
so
justly
boasted
citizen
,
from
whom
,
at
certain
juncture
,
he
could
not
help
believe
himself
derive
,
because
his
own
pencil
adopt
the
manner
of
that
great
man
with
surprising
facility
,
and
his
face
want
nothing
but
a
pair
of
whisker
and
a
beard
to
exhibit
the
express
image
of
the
Fleming
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
,
he
be
so
proud
of
this
resemblance
,
that
in
order
to
render
it
more
striking
,
he
have
at
one
time
of
his
life
resolve
to
keep
his
face
sacred
from
the
razor
;
and
in
that
purpose
have
persevere
,
notwithstanding
the
continual
reprehension
of
Mrs
Pallet
,
who
be
then
with
child
,
say
,
his
aspect
be
so
hideous
,
that
she
dread
a
miscarriage
every
hour
,
until
she
threaten
,
in
plain
term
,
to
dispute
the
sanity
of
his
intellect
,
and
apply
to
the
chancellor
for
a
committee
.
    
<EOS>
the
doctor
on
this
occasion
observe
,
that
a
man
who
be
not
proof
against
the
solicitation
of
a
woman
,
can
never
expect
to
make
a
great
figure
in
life
;
that
painter
and
poet
ought
to
cultivate
no
wife
but
the
muse
;
or
if
they
be
,
by
the
accident
of
fortune
,
incumbere
with
family
,
they
should
carefully
guard
against
that
pernicious
weakness
,
falsely
honour
with
the
appellation
of
natural
affection
,
and
pay
no
manner
of
regard
to
the
impertinent
custom
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"

that
you

yourself
honourably

into
a
rapturous
exclamation
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
dispute
,
and
attract
the
notice
of
the
inhabitant
,
many
of
whom
,
by
shrug
up
their
shoulder
,
and
point
to
their
forehead
,
give
shrewd
indication
,
that
they
believe
him
a
poor
gentleman
disorder
in
his
brain
.
    
<EOS>
They
have
no
sooner
alighted
at
the
inn
,
than
this
pseudo
-
enthusiast
propose
to
visit
the
great
church
,
in
which
he
have
be
inform
some
of
his
master
's
piece
be
to
be
see
;
and
be
remarkably
chagrin
,
when
he
understand
that
he
could
not
be
admit
till
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
He
rise
next
morning
by
day
-
break
,
and
disturb
his
fellow
-
traveller
traveller
in
such
a
noisy
and
clamorous
manner
,
that
Peregrine
determine
to
punish
him
with
some
new
infliction
,
and
while
he
put
on
his
cloath
,
actually
form
the
plan
of
promote
a
duel
between
him
and
the
doctor
;
in
the
management
of
which
he
promise
himself
store
of
entertainment
,
from
the
behaviour
of
both
.
    
<EOS>
be
provide
with
one
of
those
domestic
who
be
always
in
wait
to
offer
their
service
to
stranger
on
their
first
arrival
,
they
be
conduct
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
have
an
excellent
collection
of
picture
;
and
though
the
great
part
of
them
be
paint
by
his
favourite
artist
,
Pallet
condemn
them
all
by
the
lump
,
because
Pickle
have
tell
him
beforehand
,
that
there
be
not
one
performance
of
Rubens
among
the
number
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
place
they
visit
,
be
what
be
call
the
academy
of
painting
,
furnish
with
a
number
of
paultry
piece
,
in
which
our
painter
recognize
the
stile
of
Peter
Paul
,
with
many
expression
of
admiration
,
on
,
the
same
sort
of
previous
intelligence
.
    
<EOS>
from
this
repository
they
go
to
the
great
church
,
and
be
lead
to
the
tomb
of
Rubens
,
the
whimsical
painter
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
worship
,
with
such
appearance
of
devotion
,
that
the
attendant
,
scandalize
at
his
superstition
,
pull
him
up
,
observe
with
great
warmth
,
that
the
person
bury
in
that
place
be
no
saint
,
but
as
great
a
sinner
as
himself
;
and
that
if
he
be
spiritually
dispose
,
there
be
a
chapel
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
at
the
distance
of
three
yard
on
the
right
hand
,
to
which
he
may
retire
.
    
<EOS>
He
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
him
to
manifest
some
extraordinary
inspiration
,
while
he
reside
on
the
spot
where
Rubens
be
bear
;
and
therefore
,
his
whole
behaviour
be
an
affectation
of
rapture
,
express
in
distracted
exclamation
,
convulsive
start
,
and
uncouth
gesticulation
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
frantic
behaviour
,
he
see
an
old
Capuchin
,
with
a
white
beard
,
mount
the
pulpit
,
and
hold
forth
to
the
congregation
with
such
violence
of
emphasis
and
gesture
,
as
captivate
his
fancy
;
and
bawl
aloud
,
"
zounds
!
<EOS>
what
an
excellent
Paul
preach
at
Athens
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
pull
a
pencil
and
small
memorandum
-
book
from
his
pocket
,
and
begin
to
take
a
sketch
of
the
orator
,
with
great
eagerness
and
agitation
,
say
,
"
egad
!
friend
Raphael
,
we
shall
see
whether
you
or
I
have
get
the
good
knack
at
trump
up
an
Apostle
.
"
<EOS>
this
appearance
of
disrespect
give
offence
to
the
audience
,
which
begin
to
murmur
against
this
heretic
libertine
;
when
one
of
the
priest
belong
to
the
choir
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
ill
consequence
from
their
displeasure
,
come
and
tell
him
in
the
french
language
,
that
such
liberty
be
not
permit
in
their
religion
,
and
advise
him
to
lay
aside
his
implement
,
lest
the
people
should
take
umbrage
at
his
design
,
and
be
provoke
to
punish
him
as
a
profane
scoffer
at
their
worship
.
    
<EOS>
the
painter
see
himself
address
by
a
friar
,
who
,
while
he
speak
,
bow
with
great
complaisance
,
imagine
that
he
be
a
beg
brother
come
to
supplicate
his
charity
;
and
his
attention
be
quite
ingrosse
by
the
design
he
be
make
,
he
pat
the
priest
's
shave
crown
with
his
hand
,
say
,
Oter
tem
,
oter
tem
;
and
then
resume
his
pencil
with
great
earnestness
.
    
<EOS>
the
ecclesiastic
perceiving
that
the
stranger
do
not
comprehend
his
meaning
,
pull
him
by
the
sleeve
,
and
explain
himself
in
the
latin
tongue
:
upon
which
,
Pallet
,
provoke
at
his
intrusion
,
curse
him
aloud
for
an
impudent
beggarly
son
of
a
whore
;
and
take
out
a
schelling
,
fling
it
upon
the
pavement
,
with
manifest
sign
of
indignation
.
    
<EOS>
some
of
the
common
people
,
enrage
to
see
their
religion
contemn
,
and
their
priest
insult
at
the
very
altar
,
rise
from
their
seat
,
and
surround
the
astonished
painter
,
one
of
the
number
snatch
his
book
from
his
hand
,
and
tear
it
into
a
thousand
piece
.
<EOS>
frightened
as
he
be
,
he
could
not
help
cry
,
"
fire
and
faggot
!
<EOS>
all
my
favourite
idea
be
go
to
wreck
!
"
<EOS>
and
be
in
danger
of
be
very
roughly
handle
by
the
croud
,
have
not
Peregrine
step
in
,
and
assure
them
,
that
he
be
a
poor
unhappy
gentleman
,
who
labour
under
a
transport
of
the
brain
.
<EOS>
those
who
understand
the
french
language
communicate
this
information
to
the
rest
;
so
that
he
escape
without
any
other
chastisement
,
than
that
of
be
oblige
to
retire
.
<EOS>
and
as
they
could
not
see
the
famous
descent
from
the
cross
till
after
the
service
be
finish
,
they
be
conduct
by
their
domestique
to
the
house
of
a
painter
,
where
they
find
a
beggar
standing
for
his
picture
,
and
the
artist
actually
employ
in
represent
a
huge
louse
that
crawl
upon
his
shoulder
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
be
wonderfully
pleased
with
this
circumstance
,
which
he
say
be
altogether
a
new
thought
,
and
an
excellent
hint
,
of
which
he
would
make
his
advantage
:
<EOS>
and
in
the
course
of
his
survey
of
this
Fleming
's
performance
,
perceive
a
piece
in
which
two
fly
be
engage
upon
the
carcase
of
a
dog
half
devour
,
he
run
to
his
brother
brush
,
and
swear
he
be
worthy
of
be
a
fellow
-
citizen
of
the
immortal
Rubens
.
<EOS>
He
then
lament
,
with
many
expression
of
grief
and
resentment
,
that
he
have
lose
his
common
-
place
-
book
,
in
which
he
have
preserve
a
thousand
conception
of
the
same
sort
,
form
by
the
accidental
object
of
his
sense
and
imagination
;
and
take
an
opportunity
of
tell
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
that
in
execution
he
have
equal
,
if
not
excel
,
the
two
ancient
painter
who
vie
with
each
other
in
the
representation
of
a
curtain
and
a
bunch
of
grape
;
for
he
have
exhibit
the
image
of
a
certain
object
so
like
to
nature
,
that
the
bare
sight
of
it
set
a
whole
hog
-
sty
in
an
uproar
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
have
examine
and
applaud
all
the
production
of
this
minute
artist
,
they
return
to
the
great
church
,
and
be
entertain
with
the
view
of
that
celebrated
master
-
piece
of
Rubens
,
in
which
he
have
introduce
the
portrait
of
himself
and
his
whole
family
.
<EOS>
the
door
that
conceal
this
capital
performance
be
no
sooner
unfold
,
than
our
enthusiast
,
debar
the
use
of
speech
,
by
a
previous
covenant
with
his
friend
Pickle
,
lift
up
his
hand
and
eye
,
and
put
himself
in
the
attitude
of
Hamlet
,
when
his
father
's
ghost
appear
,
adore
in
silent
extasy
and
awe
.
<EOS>
He
even
make
a
merit
of
necessity
;
and
when
they
have
withdraw
from
the
place
,
protest
that
his
whole
faculty
be
swallow
up
in
love
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
He
now
profess
himself
more
than
ever
enamour
of
the
flemish
school
,
rave
in
extravagant
encomium
,
and
propose
,
that
the
whole
company
should
pay
homage
to
the
memory
of
the
divine
Rubens
,
by
repair
forthwith
to
the
house
in
which
he
live
,
and
prostrate
themselves
on
the
floor
of
his
painting
room
.
    
<EOS>
as
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
the
tenement
,
which

more
than
once
since

with
the
circuit

already
perform

<EOS>
Jolter
decline
it
for
the
same
reason
;
and
the
question
be
put
to
the
doctor
,
he
refuse
his
company
with
an
air
of
disdain

<EOS>
Pallet
,
pique
at
his
contemptuous
manner

ask
if

and
see
the
habitation
of
Pindoor
,
provide
he
be
in
the
city
where
that
poet
live
?
<EOS>
and
when
the
physician
observe
,
that
there
be
an
infinite
difference
between
the
man
;
"
that
I
will
allow
,
(
reply
the
painter
)
for
the
devil
a
poet
ever
live
in
Greece
or
Troy
,
that
be
worthy
to
clean
the
pencil
of
our
beloved
Rubens
.
<EOS>
"
the
physician
could
not
with
any
degree
of
temper
and
forbearance
hear
this
outrageous
blasphemy
,
for
which
,
he
say
,
Pallet
's
eye
ought
to
be
pick
out
by
owl
:
and
the
dispute
rise
,
as
usual
,
to
such
scurrility
of
language
and
indecency
of
behaviour
,
that
passenger
begin
to
take
notice

their
animosity

<EOS>
Chapter
LXVIII
Peregrine
artfully
foment
a
quarrel
between
Pallet
and
the
physician
,
who
fight
a
duel
on
the
rampart
.
   
<EOS>
the
painter
betook
himself
to
the
house
of
the
Flemish
Raphael
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
go
back
to
their
lodging
;
where
the
young
gentleman
,
take
the
advantage
of
be
alone
with
the
physician
,
recapitulate
all
the
affront
he
have
sustain
from
the
painter
's
petulance
,
aggravate
every
circumstance
of
the
disgrace
,
and
advise
him
,
in
the
capacity
of
a
friend
,
to
take
care
of
his
honour
,
which
could
not
fail
to
suffer
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
,
if
he
allow
himself
to
be
insult
with
impunity
,
by
one
so
much
his
inferior
in
every
degree
of
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
the
physician
assure
him
,
that
Pallet
have
hitherto
escape
chastisement
,
by
be
deem
an
object
unworthy
his
resentment
,
and
in
consideration
of
the
wretch
's
family
,
for
which
his
compassion
be
interested
;
but
,
that
repeat
injury
would
inflame
the
most
benevolent
disposition
:
and
although
he
could
find
no
precedent
of
duel
among
the
Greeks
and
Romans
,
whom
he
consider
as
the
pattern
of
demeanour
,
Pallet
should
no
longer
avail
himself
of
his
veneration
for
the
ancient
,
but
be
punish
for
the
very
next
offence
he
should
commit
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
spirit
up
the
doctor
to
a
resolution
from
which
he
could
not
decently
swerve
,
our
adventurer
act
the
incendiary
with
the
other
party
also
;
give
him
to
understand
,
that
the
physician
treat
his
character
with
such
contempt
,
and
behave
to
him
with
such
insolence
,
as
no
gentleman
ought
to
bear
:
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
be
every
day
put
out
of
countenance
by
their
mutual
animosity
,
which
appear
in
nothing
but
vulgar
expression
,
more
become
shoe
-
boy
and
oyster
-
woman
than
man
of
honour
and
education
;
and
therefore
he
should
be
oblige
,
contrary
to
his
inclination
,
to
break
off
all
correspondence
with
them
both
,
if
they
would
not
fall
upon
some
method
to
retrieve
the
dignity
of
their
character
.
    
<EOS>
these
representation
would
have
have
little
effect
upon
the
timidity
of
the
painter
,
who
be
likewise
too
much
of
a
Grecian
to
approve
of
single
combat
,
in
any
other
way
than
that
of
box
,
an
exercise
in
which
he
be
well
skill'd
,
have
not
they
be
accompany
with
an
insinuation
,
that
his
antagonist
be
no
Hector
,
and
that
he
may
humble
him
into
any
concession
,
without
run
the
least
personal
risk
.
<EOS>
animate
by
this
assurance
,
our
second
Rubens
set
the
trumpet
of
defiance
to
his
mouth
,
swear
that
he
value
not
his
life
a
rush
,
when
his
honour
be
concern
,
and
intreate
Mr
Pickle
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
challenge
,
which
he
would
instantly
commit
to
writing
.
    
<EOS>
the
mischievous
fomentor
highly
applaud
this
manifestation
of
courage
,
by
which
he
be
at
liberty
to
cultivate
his
friendship
and
society
;
but
decline
the
office
of
carry
the
billet
,
that
his
tenderness
of
Pallet
's
reputation
may
not
be
misinterpret
into
an
officious
desire
of
promote
quarrel
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
recommend
Tom
Pipes
,
not
only
as
a
very
proper
messenger
on
this
occasion
,
but
also
as
a
trusty
second
in
the
field
.
    
<EOS>
the
magnanimous
painter
take
his
advice
,
and
retire
to
his
chamber
,
penn'd
a
challenge
in
these
term
.
    
<EOS>
"
SIR

not
call
you
a
pedantic
coxcomb

nor
an
unmannerly
fellow

because
these
be
the

but
,
remember
,
such
as
you
be

I
neyther
love
you
nor
fear
you

but
,
on
the
contrary
,
expect
satisfaction
for
your
audacious
behaviour
to
me
,
on
diver
occasion
;
and
will
,
this
evening
,
in
the
twilight
,
meet
you
on
the
rampart
with
sword
and
pistol
,
where
the
Lord

mercy
on

<EOS>
this
resolute
defiance
,
after
have
be
submit
to
the
perusal
,
and
honour
with
the
approbation
of
our
youth
,
be
commit
to
the
charge
of
Pipes
,
who
,
accord
to
his
order
,
deliver
it
in
the
afternoon
;
and
bring
for
answer
,
that
the
physician
would
attend
him
at
the
appoint
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
the
challenger
be
evidently
discompose
at
the
unexpected
news
of
this
acceptance
,
and
run
about
the
house
in
great
disorder
,
in
quest
of
Peregrine
,
to
beg
his
further
advice
and
assistance
;
but
,
understand
that
the
youth
be
engage
in
private
with
his
adversary
,
he
begin
to
suspect
some
collusion
,
and
curse
himself
for
his
folly
and
precipitation
.
    
<EOS>
He
even
entertain
some
thought
of
retract
his
invitation
,
and
submit
to
the
triumph
of
his
antagonist
:
<EOS>
but
,
before
he
would
stoop
to
this
opprobrious
condescension
,
he
resolve
to
try
another
expedient
,
which
may
be
the
mean
of
save
both
his
character
and
person
.
<EOS>
in
this
hope
he
visit
Mr
Jolter
,
and
very
gravely
desire

would
be
so
good

undertake
the

in
a
duel
which
he
be
to
fight
that
evening
with
the
physician

<EOS>
the
governor
,
instead
of
answer
his
expectation
,
in
express
fear
and
concern
,
and
break
forth
into
exclamation
of
,
"
Good
God

gentleman

what
d'ye

<EOS>
You
shall
not
murther

another

I
will
go
directly
to
the
governor
of

who
shall
interpose
his
authority

"
I
say
,
instead
of
these
and
other
friendly
menace
of
prevention
,
Jolter
hear
the
proposal
with
the
most
phlegmatic
tranquillity
,
and
excuse
himself
from
accept
the
honour
he
intend
for
him
,
on
account
of
his
character
and
situation
,
which
would
not
permit
him
to
be
concern
in
any
such
rencounter
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
mortify
reception
be
owe
to
a
previous
hint
from
Peregrine
,
who
dread
some
sort
of
interruption
from
his
governor
,
have
make
him
acquaint
with
his
design
,
and
assure
him
,
that
the
affair
should
not
be
bring
to
any
dangerous
issue

<EOS>
thus
disappoint
,
the
dejected
challenger
be
overwhelm
with
perplexity
and
dismay
;
and
in
the
terror
of
death
or
mutilitation
,
resolve
to
deprecate
the
wrath
of
his
enemy
,
and
conform
to
any
submission
he
should
propose
;
when
he
be
accidentally
encounter
by
our
adventurer
,
who
with
demonstration
of
infinite
satisfaction
,
tell
him
in
confidence
,
that
his
billet
have
throw
the
doctor
into
an
agony
of
consternation
;
and
that
his
acceptance
of
his
challenge
be
a
meer
effort
of
despair
,
calculate
to
confound
the
ferocity
of
the
sender
,
and
dispose
him
to
listen
to
term
of
accommodation
:
that
he
have
impart
the
letter
to
him
with
fear
and
tremble
,
on
pretence
of
engage
him
as
a
second
,
but
in
reality
,
with
a
view
of
obtain
his
good
office
in
promote
a
reconciliation
;
"
but
,
perceive
the
situation
of
his
mind
,
(
add
our
hero
)
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
more
for
your
honour
to
baffle
his
expectation
;
and
therefore
I
readily
undertake
the
task
of
attend
him
to
the
field
,
in
full
assurance
,
that
he
will
there
humble
himself
before
you
,
even
to
prostration

<EOS>
in
this
security
,
you
may
go
and
prepare
your
arm
,
and
bespeak
the
assistance
of
Pipes
,
who
will
squire
you
in
the
field

while
I
keep
myself
up
,
that
our

not

fortify

the

by

Pallet

chatter
with

that
he
could
scarce

"
Mr

you
seem

make
very
light

I
trust
in

I
shall
not

down

<EOS>
sure
many
a

have
fight

without

his

do
you

You
may

the

what
then

<EOS>
Death
be
a
debt
that

exclaim
the

this
declaration
he
make
while
they
ascend
the
rampart

his
attendant
perceive
the
physician

his
second
at
the
distance
of
an
hundred
pace
before
them

give
him
notice

Pallet
in

conceal
his
pannic

discover
itself
in
an
universal
trepidation
of
body

and
the
lamentable
tone
in
which
he
answer
this
exhortation
of
pipe
;
<EOS>
say
,
"
I
do
behave
like
a
man

you
would
have
me
act
the
part

be
they

"
<EOS>
when
Tom
tell
him
that
they
have
face
about
,
and
admonish
him
to
advance
,
the
nerve
of
his
arm
refuse
their
office
,
he
could
not
hold
out
his
pistol
,
and
instead
of
go
forward
,
retreat
with
an
insensibility
of
motion
;
till
Pipes
,
place
himself
in
the
rear
,
set
his
own
back
to
that
of
his
principal
,

swear
he
should
not
budge
an
inch
farther
in
that
direction

<EOS>
while
the
valet
thus
tutor
the
painter
,
his
master
enjoy
the
terror
of
the
physician
,
which
be
more
ridiculous
than
those
of
Pallet
,
because
he
be
more
intent
upon
disguise
them
.
    
<EOS>
His
declaration
to
Pickle
in
the
morning
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
start
any
objection
when
he
receive
the
challenge
;
and
find
that
the
young
gentleman
make
no
offer
of
mediate
the
affair
,
but
rather
congratulate
him
on
the
occasion
,
when
he
communicate
the
painter
's
billet
,
all
his
effort
consist
in
oblique
hint
,
and
general
reflection
upon
the
absurdity
of
duelling
,
which
be
first
introduce
among
civilized
nation
,
by
the
barbarous
Huns
and
Longobards
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
pretend
to
ridicule
the
use
of
fire
-
arm
,
which
confound
all
the
distinction
of
skill
and
address
,
and
deprive
a
combatant
of
the
opportunity
of
signalize
his
personal
prowess
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
assent
to
the
justness
of
his
observation
;
but
at
the
same
time
represent
the
necessity
of
comply
with
the
custom
of
the
world
,
(
ridiculous
as
they
be
)
on
which
a
man
's
honour
and
reputation
depend
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
see
no
hope
of
profit
by
that
artifice
,
the
republican
's
agitation
become
more
and
more
remarkable
;
and
he
propose
in
plain
term
,
that
they
should
contend
in
armour
,
like
the
combatant
of
ancient
day
;
for
it
be
but
reasonable
,
that
they
should
practise
the
manner
of
fighting
,
since
they
adopt
the
disposition
of
those
iron
time
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
could
have
afford
more
diversion
to
our
hero
,
than
the
sight
of
two
such
duellist
case
in
iron
;
and
he
wish
that
he
have
promote
the
quarrel
in
Brussels
,
where
he
could
have
hire
the
armour
of
Charles
the
fifth
,
and
the
valiant
duke
of
Parma
,
for
their
accommodation
:
but
,
as
there
be
no
possibility
of
furnish
them
cap
-
a
-
pee
at
Antwerp
,
he
persuade
him
to
conform
to
the
modern
use
of
the
sword
,
and
meet
the
painter
on
his
own
term
;
and
suspect
that
his
fear
would
supply
him
with
other
excuse
for
decline
the
combat
,
he
comfort
him
with
some
distant
insinuation
to
the
prejudice
of
his
adversary
's
courage
,
which
would
in
all
probability
,
evaporate
,
before
any
mischief
could
happen
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
encouragement
,
he
could
not
suppress
the
reluctance
with
which
he
go
to
the
field
,
and
cast
many
a
wishful
look
over
his
left
shoulder
,
to
see
whether
or
not
his
adversary
be
at
his
heel
;
and
when
,
by
the
advice
of
his
second
,
he
take
possession
of
the
ground
,
and
turn
about
with
his
face
to
the
enemy
,
it
be
not
so
dark
,
but
that
Peregrine
could
perceive
the
unusual
paleness
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
sweat
stand
in
large
drop
upon
his
forehead
;
nay
,
there
be
a
manifest
disorder
in
his
speech
,
when
he
regret
his
want
of
the
Pila
and
Parma
,
with
which
he
would
have
make
a
rattle
noise
,
to
astonish
his
foe
,
in
spring
forward
,
and
singe
the
hymn
to
battle
,
in
the
manner
of
the
ancient
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
observe
the
hesitation
of
his
antagonist
,
who
,
far
from
advance
,
seem
to
recoil
,
and
even
struggle
with
his
second

he
guess
the
situation
of
the

's
thought
;
and
collect
all
the
manhood
that
he
possess
,
seize
the
opportunity
of
profit
by
his
enemy
's
consternation
;
and
strike
his
sword
and
pistol
together
,
advance
in
a
sort
of
trot
,
raise
a
loud
howl
,
in
which
he
repeat
,
in
lieu
of
the
spartan
song
,
part
of
a
strophe
from

of

Our

that
no

hymn
which
he
howl
,
tell
Peregrine
,
that
he
be
now
convince
of
the
truth
of
what
Pindar
sing
in
these
word
,
Ossa

for
he
have
no
sooner
begin
to
repeat
the
mellifluent
strain
of
that
divine
poet
,
than
the
wretch
his
antagonist
be
confound
,
and
his
nerve
unstrung
.
    
<EOS>
on
their
return
to
the
inn
,
he
expatiate
on
the
prudence
and
tranquillity
of
his
own
behaviour
,
and
ascribe
the
consternation
of
Pallet
to
the
remembrance
of
some
crime
that
lie
heavy
upon
his
conscience
:
for
,
in
his
opinion
,
a
man
of
virtue
and
common
sense
could
not
possibly
be
afraid
of
death
,
which
be
not
only
the
peaceful
harbour
that
receive
him
shatter
on
the
tempestuous
sea
of
life
,
but
also
the
eternal
seal
of
his
fame
and
glory
,
which
it
be
no
longer
in
his
power
to
forfeit
and
forego
.
<EOS>
He
lament
his
fate
,
in
be
doom
to
live
in
such
degenerate
day
,
when
war
be
become
a
mercenary
trade
;
and
ardently
wish
,
that
the
day
would
come
,
when
he
should
have
such
an
opportunity
of
signalize
his
courage
in
the
cause
of
liberty
,
as
that
of
Marathon
,
where
an
handful
of
Athenians
,
fight
for
their
freedom
,
defeat
the
whole
strength
of
the
persian
empire
.
"
<EOS>
Would
to
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
my
muse
be
bless
with
an
occasion
to
emulate
that
glorious
testimony
on
the
trophy
in
Cyprus
,
erect
by
Cimon
,
for
two
great
victory
gain
on
the
same
day
over
the
Persians
by
sea
and
land
;
in
which
it
be
very
remarkable
,
that
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
have
raise
the
manner
of
expression
above
the
usual
simplicity
and
modesty
of
all
other
ancient
inscription

"
    
<EOS>
He
then
repeat
it
with
all
the
pomp
of
declamation
,
and
signify
his
hope
,
that
the
French
would
one
day
invade
us
with
such
an
army
as
that
which
Xerxes
lead
into
Greece
,
that
it
may
be
in
his
power
to
devote
himself
,
like
Leonidas
,
to
the
freedom
of
his
country
.
    
<EOS>
this
memorable
combat
be
thus
determine
,
and
every
thing
that
be
remarkable
in
Antwerp
survey
,
they
send
their
baggage
down
the
Scheld
to
Rotterdam
,
and
set
out
for
the
same
place
in
a
post
-
waggon
,
which
that
same
evening
bring
them
in
safety
to
the
bank
of
the
Maeze
.
<EOS>
They
put
up
at
an
english
house
of
entertainment
,
remarkable
for
the
modesty
and
moderation
of
the
landlord
;
and
next
morning
the
doctor
go
in
person
,
to
deliver
letter
of
recommendation
to
two
dutch
gentleman
,
from
one
of
his
acquaintance
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them

to
be
at
home
when
he
call
;
so
that
he
leave
a
message
at
their
lodging
,
with
his
address
;
and
in
the
afternoon
they
wait
upon
the
company
,
and
after
many
hospitable

one
of
the
two
invite
them
to

Mean

they
have
provide
a
pleasure

in
which
they
propose
to
treat
them
with
an
excursion
upon
the
Maeze

<EOS>
this
be
almost
the
only
diversion
that
place
afford
<EOS>
,
our
young
gentleman
relish
the
proposal
;
and
notwithstanding
the
remonstrance
of
Mr
Jolter
,
who
decline
the
voyage
on
account
of
the
roughness
of
the
weather
,
they
go
on
board
without
hesitation
,
and
find
a
collation
prepare
in
the
cabin
.
<EOS>
while
they
tack
to
and
fro
in
the
river
,
under
the
impulse
of
a
mackerel
breeze
,
the
physician
express
his
satisfaction
,
and
Pallet
be
ravish
with
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
but
the
wind
increase
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
the
dutchman
,
who
have
now
an
opportunity
of
shew
their
dexterity
in
the
management
of
the
vessel
,
the
guest
find
it
inconvenient
to
stand
upon
deck
,
and
impossible
to
sit
below
,
on
account
of
the
cloud
of
tobacco
-
smoke
which
roll
from
the
pipe
of
their
entertainer
,
in
such
volume
as
annoy
them
even
to
the
hazard
of
suffocation
.
<EOS>
this
fumigation
,
together
with
the
extraordinary
motion
of
the
ship
,
begin
to
affect
the
head
and
stomach
of
the
painter
,
who
begg'd
earnestly
to
be
set
on
shore
:
but
the
dutch
gentleman
,
who
have
no
idea
of
his
suffering
,
to
which
they
have
always
be
utter
stranger
,
insist
,
with
surprising
obstinacy
of
regard
,
upon
his
staying
until
he
should
see
an
instance
of
the
skill
of
their
mariner
;
and
bring
him
on
deck
,
command
the
man
to
carry
the
vessel
's
leegunwale
under
water
.
<EOS>
this
nicety
of
navigation
they
instantly
perform
,
to
the
admiration
of
Pickle
,
the
discomposure
of
the
doctor
,
and
terror
of
Pallet
,
who
bless
himself
from
the
courtesy
of
a
dutchman
,
and
pray
to
heaven
for
his
deliverance
.
    
<EOS>
while
the
Hollanders
enjoy
the
reputation
of
this
feat
,
and
the
distress
of
the
painter
at
the
same
time
,
the
yacht
be
overtake
by
a
sudden
squall
,
that
overset
her
in
a
moment

and
fling
every
man
overboard
into
the
Maeze
,
before
they
could
have
the

warning
of
their
fate
,
much
less

<EOS>
Peregrine

who
be
an
expert
swimmer

reach
the

in
safety

the

in

of
despair

lay
fast
hold
on
the
trunk

breech
of
one
of
the

the
entertainer
land
at
the
bomb

key
,
smoke
their
pipe
all
the
way
with
great
deliberation
;
and
the
poor
painter
must
have
go
to
the
bottom
,
have
not
he
be
encounter
by
the
cable
of
a
ship
,
that
lie
at
anchor
near
the
scene
of
their
disaster

<EOS>
though
his
sense
have
forsake
him
,
his
hand
fasten
by
instinct
on
this
providential
occurrence
,
which
he
hold
with
such
a
convulsive
grasp
,
that
when
a
boat
be
send
out
to
bring
him
on
shore
,
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
his
finger

<EOS>
He
be
carry
into
a
house
,
deprive
of
the
use
of
speech
,
and
bereft
of
all
sensation
;
and
be
suspend
by
the
heel

a
vast
quantity
of
water
run
out
of
his

<EOS>
this
evacuation
be
make
,
he
begin
to
utter
dreadful
groan
,
which
gradually
increase
to
a
continued
roar
;
and
after
he
have
regain
the
use
of
his
sense
,
undergo
a
delirium
that
last
several
hour
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
treater
,
they
never
dream
of
express
the
least
concern
to
Pickle
or
the
physician
for
what
have
happen
,
because
it
be
an
accident
so
common
,
as
to
pass
without
notice
;
but
they
be
very
much
surprize
to
find
,
upon
inquiry
,
that
Pallet
could
not
swim
,
it
be
as
natural
for
a
Dutchman
,
as
a
deal

board
,
to
float
upon
the
surface
.
    
<EOS>
leave
the
care

the
vessel
to
the

the

in

for
the
convenience
of

box
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
mouth
in
the
apartment
unfurnished
with
a
tube
,
so
that
they
resemble
a
convocation
of
Chimeras
breathing
fire
and
smoke
;
and
our
gentleman
be
fain
to
imitate
their
example
in
their
own
defence
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
the
conversation
be
either
very
sprightly
or
polite
;
the
whole
entertainment
be
of
the
dutch
cast
,
that
is

frowzy
and
phlegmatic
:
and
our

and
disgust
with
every

,
curse
the
hour
in
which
the

them
with
such
troublesome
companion

<EOS>
Next
morning

by

and
after
breakfast

attend
their
english

the
house
of
a
person
that
possess
a
very
curious
cabinet
of
curiosity

to
which
they
have
secure
our

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
as

by
the

of
one
of
their
conductor

that
he
do
not
make
a

that
they
be
Englishmen
,
and
recommend
to
his
friend
,
he
be
content
to
submit
them
to
their
perusal
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
lead
them
up
a
dark
stair
,
into
a
small
room
,
decorate
with
a
few
paltry
figure
in

of
Paris
,
two

three
miserable
landschape

a

a

and
about
two
dozen

<EOS>
the
virtuoso
have
exhibit
these
particular
,
eye
the
stranger
with
a
look
solliciting
admiration
and
applause
;
and
as
he
could
not
perceive
any
symptom
of

their
gesture
or
countenance

withdraw
a
curtain
,
and
display
a
wainscot
chest
of
drawer

in
which
,
he
give
them
to
understand
,
be
something
that
would
agreeably
amuse
the
imagination
.
<EOS>
Our
traveller
,
regale
with
this
notice
,
imagine
that
they
would
be
entertain
with
the
sight
of
some
curious
medal
,
or
other
production
of
antiquity

but
how
be
they
disappoint

when
they
see
nothing
but
a
variety
of

in
whimsical

,
in
each
drawer

<EOS>
after
he
have
detain
them
full
two
hour
with
a
tedious
commentary
upon
the
shape
,
size
and
colour
of
each
department
,
he
,
with
a
supercilious
simper
,
desire
that
the
english
gentleman
would
frankly
and
candidly
declare
,
whether
his
cabinet
,
or
that
of
mynheer
Sloane
,
at
London
,
be
the
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
when
this

exclaim
,
"
by

<EOS>
they

observe

that
what
they

be
very
curious

that
no

be
equal
to
that
of
Sir

,
which

exclusive
of

tho

<EOS>
he

his
incredulity

give
our

tragedy
act

an
entertainment
which
,
of
all
other

have
the
strange
effect
upon
the
organ
of
our
hero
:
the
dress
of
their
chief
personage
be
so
antick
,
their
manner
so
aukwardly
absurd
,
and
their
language
so
ridiculously
unfit

the

of

honour
,
that
Peregrine

diuretically
affect

Scipio

very
well
be
support
to
give
away
,
with

out
any
great
effort
of
generosity

indeed
the
celtiberian
prince

be
of
that
opinion

victor

none

the

if
the

agility

his
nose
would
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
fury

find
himself
in
such
imminent
jeopardy

with
great

that
the

about
the
cold

hot
method
of

proceed
to
such
a

rebuke
him
for
his
unmannerly
petulance

which
(
he
say
)
render
him
unfit
for
the
purpose
,
and
unworthy

of

<EOS>
this
unexpected

overwhelm
the

during
the
remain

sit
in
silent
mortification

<EOS>
in
all
probability
he
deliberate
with
himself
,
whether

not
he
should
expostulate
with
the
young
gentleman
on
the
freedom
he
have
take
with
his
character
in
a
company
of
stranger
;
but
as
he
know
that
he
have
not
a
Pallet
to
deal
with
,
he
very
prudently
suppress
that
suggestion
,

in

chew
the
cud
of

the
doctor
,
whose
grudge
against
Peregrine
be
rather
inflame
than
allay
by
our

indifference

have
tamper
with

who
be
proud

by

immediately
see
his

without

argument
to
dissuade

that

her
without
a
portion
.
    
<EOS>
this
last
offer
seem
to
have
some
weight
with
the
father
,
who
receive
it
with
civility
,
and
promise
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
to
favour
him
with
a
final
answer
to
his
demand
.
<EOS>
He
,
accordingly
,
that
same
evening
consult
his
wife
,
who
be
exasperate
at
the
prospect
of
her
daughter
's
independency
,
argue
with
the
most
virulent
expostulation
against
the
match
,
as
an
impudent
scheme
of
her
own
planning
,
with
a
view
of
insult
her
parent
,
towards
whom
she
have
already
be
guilty
of
the
most
vicious
disobedience
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
use
such
remonstrance
,
as
not
only
avert
this
weak
husband
's
inclination
from
the
proposal
which
he
have
relish
before
,
but
even
instigate
him
to
apply
for
a
warrant
to
apprehend
his
daughter
,
on
the
supposition
that
she
be
about
to
bestow
herself
in
marriage
,
without
his
privity
or
consent
.
    
<EOS>
the
justice
of
peace
to
whom
this
application
be
make
,
though
he
could
not
refuse
the
order
,
yet
,
be
no
stranger
to
the
malevolence
of
the
mother
,
which
,
together
with
Gamaliel
's
simplicity
,
be
notorious
in
the
county
,
he
send
an
intimation
of
what
have
happen
to
the
garison
;
upon
which
,
a
couple
of
centinel
be
place
on
the
gate
,
and
at
the
pressing
solicitation
of
the
lover
,
as
well
as
the
desire
of
the
commodore
,
her
brother
and
aunt
,
Julia
be
wed
without
further
delay
;
the
ceremony
be
perform
by
Mr
Jolter
,
because
the
parish
-
priest
prudently
decline
any
occasion
of
give
offence
,
and
the
curate
be
too
much
in
the
interest
of
their
enemy
,
to
be
employ
in
that
office

<EOS>
this
domestic
concern

satisfaction

unspeakable

for
some
week

during

in

of
the

Mr

he
may
man

"
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
not
a
little
surprized
to
hear
the
commodore
talk
in
this
stile
;
and
immediately
conjecture
,
that
his
friend
Godfrey
have
inform
him
of
the
whole
affair
.
    
<EOS>
instead
of
listen
to
this
approbation
of
his
flame
,
with
those
transport
of
joy
which
he
would
have
feel
,
have
he
retain
his
former
sentiment
,
he
be
chagrin
at
Trunnion
's
declaration
,
and
offend
ar
the
presumption
of
the
young
soldier
,
in
pretend
to
disclose
the
secret
with
which
he
have
intrust
him
.
<EOS>
redden
with
these
reflection
,
he
assure
the
commodore
,
that
he
never
have
serious
thought
of
matrimony
:
so
that
,
if
any
person
have
tell
him
he
be
under
any
engagement
of
that
kind
,
he
have
abuse
his
ear
;
for
,
he
protest
,
that
he
would
never
contract
such
attachment
,
without
his
knowledge
and
express
permission
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
commend
him
for
his
prudent
resolution
,
and
observe
,
that
though
no
person
mention
to
him
what
promise
have
pass
betwixt
him
and
his
sweetheart
,
it
be
very
plain
that
he
have
make
love
to
her
;
and
therefore
,
it
be
to
be
suppose
,
that
his
intention
be
honourable
:
<EOS>
for
,
he
could
not
believe
he
be
such
a
rogue
in
his
heart
,
as
to
endeavour
to
debauch
the
daughter
of
a
brave
officer
,
who
have
serve
his
country
with
credit
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
remonstrance
,
which
Pickle
impute
to
the
commodore
's
ignorance
of
the
world
,
he
set
out
for
the
habitation
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
with
the
unjustifiable
sentiment
of
a
man
of
pleasure
,
who
sacrifice
every
consideration
to
the
desire
of
his
ruling
appetite
;
and
as
Winchester
lie
in
his
way
,
resolve
to
visit
some
of
his
friend
who
live
in
that
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
house
of
one
of
these
,
that
he
be
inform
of
Emilia

then
in

with
her

upon
which
,
he
excuse
himself
from

to
drink
tea
,
and
immediately
repair
to
their
lodging
,
accord
to
the
direction
he
have
receive
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
arrive
at
the
door
,
instead
of
undergo
that
perturbation
of
spirit
,
which
a
lover
,
in
his
interesting
situation
,
may
be
suppose
to
feel
,
he
suffer
no
emotion
but
that
of
vanity
and
pride
,
favour
with
an
opportunity
of
self
-
gratification
,
and
enter
his
Emilia
's
apartment
with
the
air
of
a
conceited
petit
maitre
,
rather
than
that
of
the
respectful
admirer
,
when
he
visit
the
object
of
his
passion
,
after
an
absence
of
seventeen
month
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
lady
have
be
very
much
disoblige
at
his
mortifying
neglect
of
her
brother
's
letter
,
have
summon
all
her
own
pride
and
resolution
to
her
aid
;
and
by
mean
of
a
happy
disposition
,
so
far
overcome
her
chagrin
at
his
indifference
,
that
she
be
able
to
behave
in
his
presence
with
apparent
tranquillity
and
ease
.
<EOS>
She
be
even
pleased
to
find
,
he
have
by
accident
choose
a
time
for
his
visit
,
when
she
be
surround
by
two

three
young

who
profess
themselves
her
admirer

<EOS>
Our
gallant
be
no
sooner
anounce
,
than
she
collect
all
her
coquettry
,
put
on
the
gay
air
she
could
assume
,
and
contrive
to
giggle
just
as
he
appear
at
the
room
-
door
.
<EOS>
the
compliment
of
salutation
be
perform
,
she
welcome
him
to
England
in
a
careless
manner
,
ask
the
news
of
Paris
,
and
,
before
he
could
make
any
reply
,
desire
one
of
the
other
gentleman
to
proceed
with
the
sequel
of
that
comical
adventure
,
in
the
relation
of
which
he
have
be
interrupt
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
smile
within
himself
at
this
behaviour
,
which
(
without
all
doubt
he
believe
)
<EOS>
she
have
affect
to
punish
him
for
his
unkind
silence
,
while
he
be
abroad
;
be
fully
persuade
,
that
her
heart
be
absolutely
at
his
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
,
he
practise
his
parisian
improvement
on
the
art
of
conversation
,
and
utter
a
thousand
prettiness
in
the
way
of
compliment
,
with
such
incredible
rotation
of
tongue
,
that
his
rival
be
strike
dumb
with
astonishment
;
and
Emilia
fret
out
of
all
temper
,
at
see
herself
deprive
of
the
prerogative
of
the
sex
.
<EOS>
He
persist
,
however
,
in
this
surprising
loquacity
,
until
the
rest
of
the
company
think
proper
to
withdraw
,
and
then
contract
his
discourse
into
the
focus
of
love
,
which
now
put
on
a
very
different
appearance
from
that
which
it
have
formerly
wear
.
<EOS>
instead
of
that
awful
veneration
which
her
presence
use
to
inspire
,
that
chastity
of
sentiment
and
delicacy
of
expression
,
he
now
gaze
upon
her
with
the
eye
of
a
libertine
,
he
glow
with
the
impatience
of
desire
,
talk
in
a
strain
that
barely
keep
within
the
bound
of
decency
,
and
attempt
to
snatch
such
favour
as
she
,
in
the
tenderness
of
mutual
acknowledgement
,
have
once
vouchsafe
to
bestow
.
    
<EOS>
Grieved
and
offend
as
she
be
,
at
this
palpable
alteration
in
his
carriage
<EOS>
,
she
disdain
to
remind
him
of
his
former
deportment
,
and
with
dissemble
good
humour
,
rally
him
on
the
progress
he
have
make
in
gallantry
and
address
:
but
,
far
from
submit
to
the
liberty
he
would
have
take
,
she
keep
her
person
sacred
from
his
touch
,
and
would
not
even
suffer
him
to
ravish
a
kiss
of
her
fair
hand
:
so
that
he
reap
no
other
advantage
from
the
exercise
of
his
talent
,
during
this
interview
,
which
last
a
whole
hour
,
than
that
of
know
he
have
over
-
rate
his
own
importance
;
and
that
Emily
's
heart
be
not
a
garison
likely
to
surrender
at
discretion
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
his
address
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
the
mother
,
who
have
go
abroad
to
visit
by
herself
;
and
the
conversation
become
more
general
,
he
understand
,
that
Godfrey
be
at
London
,
solicit
for
a
lieutenancy
that
have
fall
vacant
in
the
regiment
to
which
he
belong
;
and
that
Miss
Sophy
be
at
home
with
her
father
.
    
<EOS>
though
our
adventurer
have
not
meet
with
all
the
success
he
expect
in
his
first
visit
,
he
do
not
despair
of
reduce
the
fortress
,
believe
that
in
time
there
would
be
a
mutiny
in
his
favour
;
and
accordingly
,
carry
on
the
siege
for
several
day
,
without
profit
by
his
perseverance
;
till
at
length
,
have
attend
the

house
in

country
,
he
begin
to
look
upon
this
adventure
as

and
resolve
to
discontinue
his
attack
,
in
hope
of
meet
with
a
more
favourable
occasion

in

much
concerned

which
be
the
more
unexpected

because
Godfrey
have

that

when
the
old
gentleman
recover
his
health
,
he
be
so
penetrate
with
Peregrine
's
behaviour
,
that
he
actually
would
have
make
over
to
him
his
whole
fortune
,
and
depend
upon
him
for
his
own
subsistence
,
have
not
our
youth
oppose
the
execution
of
the
deed
with
all
his
influence
and
may

and
even
persuade
him
to

alacrity

and
warmth
of

discovery
be
not
to
be
impute
to
any
other
cause
:
and
he
hope
Mr
Pickle
would
acquit
him
of
all
share
in
the
transaction
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
very
well
pleased
to
be
thus
undeceived
;
his
countenance
immediately
clear
up
,
the
formality
of
his
behaviour
relaxed
into
his
usual
familiarity
;
he
ask
pardon
for
his
unmannerly
neglect
of
Godfrey
's
letter
,
which
,
he
protest
,
be
not
owe
to
any
disregard
,
or
abatement
of
friendship
,
but
to
a
hurry
of
youthful
engagement
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
have
procrastinate
his
answer
from
time
to
time
,
until
he
be
ready
to
return
in
person
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
soldier
be
content
with
this
apology
;
and
as
Pickle
's
intention
,
with
respect
to
his
sister
,
be
still
dubious
and
undeclared
,
he
do
not
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
him
,
as
yet
,
to
express
any
resentment
on
that
score
;
but
be
wise
enough
to
foresee
,
that
the
renewal
of
his
intimacy
with
our
young
gentleman
,
may
be
the
mean
of
revive
that
flame
which
have
be
dissipate
by
a
variety
of
new
idea
.
<EOS>
with
those
sentiment
he
lay
aside
all
reserve
,
and
their
communication
immediately
resume
its
former
channel
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
make
him
acquaint
with
all
the
adventure
in
which
he
have
be
engage
since
their
parting
;
and
he
,
with
the
same
confidence
,
relate
the
remarkable
incident
of
his
own
fate
;
among
other
thing
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
upon
obtain
a
commission
in
the
army
,
the
father
of
his
dear
Sophy
,
without
once
inquire
about
the
occasion
of
his
promotion
,
have
not
only
favour
him
with
his
countenance
in
a
much
great
degree
than
heretofore
,
but
also
contribute
his
interest
,
and
even
promise
the
assistance
of
his
purse
,
in
procure
for
him
a
lieutenancy
,
which
he
be
then
solicit
with
all
his
power
;
whereas
,
if
he
have
not
be
enable
,
by
a
most
accidental
piece
of
good
fortune
,
to
lift
himself
into
the
sphere
of
an
officer
,
he
have
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
,
that
this
gentleman
,
and
all
the
rest
of
his
wealthy
relation
,
would
have
suffer
him
to
languish
in
obscurity
and
distress
;
and
,
by
turn
his
misfortune
into
reproach
,
make
it
a
plea
for
their
own
want
of
generosity
and
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
understand
this
situation
of
his
friend
's
affair
,
would
have
accommodate
him
,
upon
the
instant
,
with
a
sum
to
accelerate
the
passage
of
his
commission
through
the
office
;
but
,
be
too
well
acquainted
with
his
scrupulous
disposition
,
to
manifest
his
benevolence
in
that
manner
,
he
find
mean
to
introduce
himself
to
one
of
the
gentleman
of
the
war
-
office
,
who
be
so
well
satisfied
with
the
argument
he
use
in
behalf
of
his
friend
,
that
Godfrey
's
business
be
transact
in
a
very
few
day
,
though
he

the

communicate
his
design
of

and
two
gentleman
be
at
play
,
begin
to
bet
with
so
little
appearance
of
judgment
,
that
one
of
the
adventurer
then
present

with
the
desire
of

by
his
inexperience
;
and
when

to
take

game
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
,
assume
the
air
of
a
self
-
conceite
dupe
,
answer
,
that
he
do
not
choose
to
throw
away
his
time
for
nothing
,
but

if

<EOS>
this
declaration
be
very
agreeable
to
the

who
want
to

further
confirm
in
the
opinion
he
have
conceive
of
the
stranger

before

<EOS>
the

,
Gauntlet
put
off
his
coat
,
and
begin
with
seeming
eagerness
,
win
the
first
game
,
because
his
antagonist
keep
up
his
play
,
with
a
view
of
encourage
him
to
wager
a
great
sum
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
purposely
bite
at
the
hook
,
the
stake
be
double
,
and
he
be
again
victorious
,
by
the
permission
of
his
competitor
.
    
<EOS>
He
now
begin
to
yawn
;
and
observe
,
that
it
be
not
worth
his
while
to
proceed
in
such
a
childish
manner
,
the
other
swore
,
in
an
affected
passion
,
that
he
would
play
with
him
for
twenty
guinea
.
<EOS>
the
proposal
be

(
thro

of
Godfrey

who

<EOS>
Godfrey

pretend
to
lose
his
temper
,
<EOS>

with
his
desire
,
and
have
get

<EOS>
the

to
be
overcome
,

to
rage
with
great
violence
,
break
the
mast
to
piece
,
throw
the
ball
out
at
the
window
,
and
,
in
the
fury
of
his
indignation
,
defy
his
antagonist
to
meet
him
to
-
morrow
,
when
he
should
be
refresh
from
the
fatigue
of
travel
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
welcome
invitation
to
the
gamester
,
who
imagine
that
the
soldier
would
turn
out
a
most
beneficial
prize
,
assure
him
,
that
he
would
not
fail
to
be

in
order

<EOS>
Gauntlet
go
home
to
his
lodging
,
fully
certify
of
his
own
superiority
;
and
take
his
measure
with
Peregrine
,
touch
the
prosecution
of
their
scheme
;
while
his
opponent
make
a
report
of
his
success
to
the
brother

<EOS>
Affairs

and
the
room

or

<EOS>

one
hundred
pound
a
game

and
one
of
the
knight
of

to
lay
another
hundred
on
the
head
of
his
associate

<EOS>
Godfrey
take
him
up
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
a
second
worthy
of
the
same
class
<EOS>
see
him
so
eager
,
challenge
him
to
treble
the
sum
;
and
his
proposal
meet
with
the
same
reception
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
company
,
whose
expectation
be
raise
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
.
<EOS>
the
game
be
begin
,
and
the
soldier
have
lose
the
first
hazard
,
the
odd
be
offer
by
the
confederacy
,
with
great
vociferation
;
but
no
body
would
run
such
a
risk
,
in
favour
of
a
person
who
be
utterly
unknown
.
<EOS>
the
sharp
have
gain
the
second
also
,
the
noise
increase
to
a
surprising
clamour
,
not
only
of
the
gang
,
but
likewise
of
almost
all
the
spectator
,
who
desire
to
lay
two
to
one
against
the
brother
of
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
be
present
,
perceive
the
cupidity
of
the
association
sufficiently
inflame
,
all
of
a
sudden
open
his
mouth
,
and
answer
their
bett
,
to
the
amount
of
twelve
hundred
pound
;
which
be
immediately
deposit
,
on
both
side
,
in
money
and
note
:
so
that
this
be
(
perhaps
)
the
most
important
game
that
ever
be
plaid
at
billiard
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
see
the
agreement
settle
,
strike
his
antagonist
's
ball
into
the
pocket
,
in
a
twinkling
,
tho
'
it
be
in
one
of
those
situation
which
be
suppose
to
be
against
the
striker
.
<EOS>
the
better
be
a
little
discomposed
at
this
event
,
for
which
,
however
,
they
console
themselves
,
by
impute
the
success
to
accident
;
but
when
,
at
the
very
next
stroke
,
he
spring
it
over
the
table
,
their
countenance
undergo
an
instantaneous
distraction
of
feature
,
and
they
wait
,
in
the
most
dreadful
suspense
,
for
the
next
hazard
,
which
be
likewise
take
,
with
infinite
ease
,
by
the
soldier
,
the
blood
forsook
their
cheek
,
and
the
interjection
Zounds
!
<EOS>
pronounce
with
a
look
of
consternation
,
and
in
a
tone
of
despair
,
proceed
from
every
mouth
,
at
the
same
instant
of
time
.
<EOS>
They
be
overwhelmed
with
horror
and
astonishment
at
see
three
hazard
take
in
as
many
stroke
,
from
a
person
of
their
friend
's
dexterity
;
and
shrewdly
suspect
,
that
the
whole
be
a
scheme
preconcerte
for
their
destruction
:
on
this
supposition
they
change
the
note
,
and
attempt
to
effect
their
own
indemnification
,
by
propose
to
lay
the
odd
in
favour
of
Gauntlet
;
but
so
much
be
the
opinion
of
the
company
alter
by
that
young
gentleman
's
success
,
that
no
body
would
venture
to
espouse
the
cause
of
his
competitor
,
who
chance
to
improve
his
game
by
the
addition
of
another
lucky
hit
,
diminish
the
concern
,
and
revive
the
hope
of
his
adherent
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
gleam
of
fortune
,
do
not
long
continue
:
Godfrey
collect
his
whole
art
and
capacity
,
and
augment
his
score
to
number
ten
,
indulge
himself
with
a
view
of
the
whole
fraternity
.
    
<EOS>
the
visage
of
these
professor
have
adopt
different
shade
of
complexion
,
at
every
hazard
he
have
take
;
from
their
natural
colour
they
have
shift
into
a
sallow
hue
;
from
thence
into
pale
;
from
pale
into
yellow
,
which
degenerate
into
a
mahogony
tint
;
and
now
they
see
seventeen
hundred
pound
of
their
stock
depend
upon
a
single
stroke
,
they
stand
like
so
many
swarthy
moor
,
jaundice
with
terror
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
the
fire
which

glow

of
the
player
,
seem
utterly
extinct
,
and
his
carbuncle
exhibit
a
livid
appearance
,
as
if
a
gangrene
have
already
make
some
progress
in
his
face
;
his
hand
begin
to
shake
,
and
his
whole
frame
be
seize
with
such
trepidation
,
that
he
be
fain
to
swallow
a
bumper
of
brandy
,
in
order
to
re
-
establish
the
tranquillity
of
his
nerve
.
<EOS>
this
expedient
,
however
,
do
not
produce
the
desire
effect
;
for
he
aim
the
ball
at
the
lead
with
such
discomposure
,
that
it
strike
on
the
wrong
side
,
and
come
off
at
an
angle
which
direct
it
full
in
the
middle
hole
.
<EOS>
this
fatal
accident
be
attend
with
an
universal
groan
,
as
if
the
whole
universe
have
go
to
wreck
:
and
notwithstanding
that
tranquillity
for
which
adventurer
be
so
remarkable
,
this
loss
make
such
an
impression
upon
them
all
,
that
each
,
in
particular
,
manifest
his
chagrin
,
by
the
most
violent
emotion
.
<EOS>
one
turn
up
his
eye
to
heaven
,
and
bite
his
nether
lip
;
another
gnaw
his
finger
,
while
he
stalk
across
the
room
;
a
third
blaspheme
with
horrible
imprecation
;
and
he
who
play
the
partie
,
sneak
off
,
grind
his
tooth
together
,
with
a
look
that
baffle
all
description
,
and
as
he
cross
the
threshold
,
exclaim
,
"
a
damn'd
bite
,
by
G####d
!
"
    
<EOS>
the
victor
,
after
have
insult
them
,
by
ask
if
they
be
dispose
for
another
chance
,
carry
off
their
winning
,
with
the
appearance
of
great
composure
,
though
in
their
heart
they
be
transport
with
unspeakable
joy
;
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
booty
they
have
gain
,
as
in
consideration
of
have
so
effectually
destroy
such
a
nest
of
pernicious
miscreant
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
believe
,
that
now
he
have
find
an
opportunity
of
serve
his
friend
,
without
give
offence
to
the
delicacy
of
his
honour
,
tell
him
,
upon
their
arrival
at
their
lodging
,
that
fortune
have
at
length
enable
him
to
become
in
a
manner
independent
,
or
at
least
to
make
himself
easy
in
his
circumstance
,
by
purchase
a
company
with
the
money
he
have
win
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
put
his
share
of
the
success
in
Gauntlet
's
hand
,
as
a
sum
that
of
right
belong
to
him
,
and
promise
to
write
in
his
behalf
to
a
nobleman
,
who
have
interest
enough
to
promote
such
a
quick
rise
in
the
service
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
thank
him
for
his
obliging
intention
,
but
absolutely
refuse
,
with
great
loftiness
of
demeanour
,
to
appropriate
to
his
own
use
any
part
of
the
money
which
Pickle
have
gain
,
and
seem
affront
at
the
other
's
entertain
a
sentiment
so
unworthy
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
accept
,
in
the
way
of
loan
,
such
an
addition
to
his
own
stock
,
as
would
amount
to
the
price
of
a
company
of
foot
;
but
express
great
confidence
in
the
future
exertion
of
that
talent
which
have
be
bless
with
such
a
prosperous
beginning
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
find
him
thus
obstinately
deaf
to
the
voice
of
his
own
interest
,
resolve
to
govern
himself
in
his
next
endeavour
of
friendship
,
by
his
experience
of
this
ticklish
punctilio
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
give
a
handsome
benefaction
to
the
hospital
,
out
of
these
first
fruit
of
his
success
in
play
,
and
reserve
two
hundred
pound
for
a
set
of
diamond
ear

ring
and

,
which
he
intend
for
a
present
to

chapter
LXXV
<EOS>
the
two
friend
eclipse
all
their
competitor
in
gallantry
,
and
practise
a
pleasant
project
of
revenge
upon
the
physician
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
the
fame
of
their
exploit
against
the
sharper
,
be
immediately
diffuse
through
all
company
at
the
Bath
;
so
that
when
our
adventurer
appear
in
public
,
they
be
point
out
by
an
hundred
extended
finger
,
and
consider
as
consummate
artist
in
all
the
different
specie
of
finesse
,
which
they
would
not
fail
to
practise
with
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
opinion
of
their
character
any
obstacle
to
their
reception
into
the
fashionable
party
in
the
place
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
such
a
recommendation
,
which
(
as
I
have
already
hint
)
never
fail
to
operate
for
the
advantage
of
the
possessor
.
    
<EOS>
this
first
adventure
,
therefore
,
serve
them
as
an
introduction
to
the
company
at
Bath
,
who
be
not
a
little
surprized
to
find
their
expectation
baffle
by
the
conduct
of
the
two
companion
;
because
,
far
from
engage
deeply
at
play
,
they
rather
shun
all
occasion
of
gaming
,
and
direct
their
attention
to
gallantry
,
in
which
our
hero
shone
unrivalled
.
    
<EOS>
His
external
qualification
,
exclusive
of
any
other
merit
,
be
strong
enough
to
captivate
the
common
run
of
the
female
sex
;
and
these
,
reinforce
with
a
sprightliness
of
conversation
,
and
a
most
insinuating
address
,
become
irresistible
,
even
by
those
who
be
fortify
with
pride
,
caution
or
indifference
.
<EOS>
but
,
among
all
the
nymph
of
this
gay
place
,
he
do
not
meet
with
one
object
that
dispute
the
empire
of
his
heart
with
Emilia
;
and
therefore
he
divide
his
attachment
accord
to
the
suggestion
of
vanity
and
whim
;
so
that
,
before
he
have
reside
a
fortnight
at
the
Bath
,
he
have
set
all
the
lady
by
the
ear
,
and
furnish
all
the
hundred
tongue
of
scandal
with
full
employment
.
<EOS>
the
splendor
of
his
appearance
excite
the
inquiry
of
envy
,
which
,
instead
of
discover
any
circumstance
to
his
prejudice
,
be
curse
with
the
information
of
his
be
a
young
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
and
heir
to
an
immense
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
the
countenance
of
some
of
his
quality
-
friend
,
who
arrive
at
Bath
,
confirm
this
piece
of
intelligence
:
upon
which
,
his
acquaintance
be
court
and
cultivate
with
great
assiduity
;
and
he
meet
with
such
advance
from
some
of
the
fair
sex
,
as
render
him
extremely
fortunate
in
his
amour
.
<EOS>
nor
be
his
friend
Godfrey
a
stranger
to
favour
of
the
same
kind
;
his
accomplishment
be
exactly
calculate
for
the
meridian
of
female
taste
;
and
with
certain
individual
of
that
sex
,
his
muscular
frame
,
and
the
robust
connection
of
his
limb
,
be
more
attractive
than
the
delicate
proportion
of
his
companion
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
reign
paramount
among
those
inamorata
's
who
be
turn
of
thirty
,
without
be
under
the
necessity
of
proceed
by
tedious
address
;
and
be
think
to
have
cooperate
with
the
water
,
in
remove
the
sterility
of
certain
lady
,
who
have
long
undergo
the
reproach
and
disgust
of
their
husband
:
while
Peregrine
set
up
his
throne
among
those
who
labour
under
the
disease
of
celibacy
,
from
the
pert
miss
of
fifteen
,
who
,
with
a
flutter
heart
,
toss
her
head
,
bridle
up
,
and
giggle
involuntarily
at
sight
of
an
handsome
young
man
,
to
the
staid
maiden
of
twenty
-
eight
,
who
with
a
demure
aspect
moralize
on
the
vanity
of
beauty
,
the
folly
of
youth
and
simplicity
of
woman
,
and
expatiate
on
friendship
,
benevolence
and
good
sense
,
in
the
stile
of
a
platonic
philosopher
.
    
<EOS>
in
such
a
diversity
of
disposition
,
his
conquest
be
attend
with
all
the
heart
-
burning
,
animosity
and
turmoil
of
jealousy
and
spite
.
<EOS>
the
young
class
take
all
opportunity
of
mortify
their
senior
in
public
,
by
treat
them
with
that
indignity
which
(
contrary
to
the
general
privilege
of
age
)
be
by
the
consent
and
connivance
of
mankind
,
level
against
those
who
have
the
misfortune
to
come
under
the
denomination
of
old
maid
;
and
these
last
retort
their
hostility
in
the
private
machination
of
slander
,
support
by
experience
and
subtility
of
invention
.
<EOS>
not
one
day
pass
,
in
which
some
new
story
do
not
circulate
,
to
the
prejudice
of
one
or
other
of
those
rival
.
    
<EOS>
if
our
hero
,
in
the
long
-
room
,
chance
to
quit
one
of
the
moralist
,
with
whom
he
have
be
engage
in
conversation
,
he
be
immediately
accost
by
a
number
of
the
opposite
faction
,
who
,
with
ironical
smile
,
upbraid
him
with
cruelty
to
the
poor
lady
he
have
leave
,
exhort
him
to
have
compassion
on
her
suffering
,
and
turn
their
eye
towards
the
object
of
their
intercession
,
break
forth
into
an
universal
peal
of
laughter
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
when
Peregrine
,
in
consequence
of
have
dance
with
one
of
the
minor
over
-
night
,
visit
her
in
the
morning
,
the
Platonists
immediately
lay
hold
on
the
occasion
,
task
their
imagination
,
associate
idea
,
and
in
sage
insinuation
retail
a
thousand
circumstance
of
the
interview
,
which
never
have
any
foundation
in
truth
.
<EOS>
They
observe
,
that
if
girl
be
determined
to
behave
with
such
indiscretion
,
they
must
lay
their
account
with
incur
the
censure
of
the
world
;
that
she
in
question
,
be
old
enough
to
act
more
circumspectly
;
and
wonder
that
her
mother
would
permit
any
young
fellow
to
approach
the
chamber
,
while
her
daughter
be
in
naked
bed
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
servant
's
peeping
through
the
key
-
hole
,
to
be
sure
it
be
an
unlucky
accident
;
but
people
ought
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
such
curiosity
,
and
give
their
domestic
no
cause
to
employ
their
penetration
.
<EOS>
these
,
and
other
such
reflection
,
be
occasionally
whisper
as
secret
among
those
who
be
know
to
be
communicative
;
so
that
,
in
a
few
hour
,
it
become
the
general
topic
of
discourse
;
and
as
it
have
be
divulge
under
injunction
of
secrecy
,
it
be
almost
impossible
to
trace
the
scandal
to
its
origin
;
because
every
person
concerned
,
must
have
promulgate
her
own
breach
of
trust
,
in
discover
her
author
of
the
report
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
instead
of
allay
,
rather
exasperate
this
contention
,
by
an
artful
distribution
of
his
attention
among
the
competitor
;
<EOS>
well
know
,
that
should
his
regard
be
converge
into
one
point
,
he
would
soon
forfeit
the
pleasure
he
enjoy
,
in
see
them
at
variance
;
for
both
party
would
join
against
the
common
enemy
,
and
his
favourite
would
be
persecute
by
the
whole
coalition
.
    
<EOS>
He
perceive
,
that
among
the
secret
agent
of
scandal
,
none
be
so
busy
as
the
physician
,
a
class
of
animal
who
live
in
this
place
,
like
so
many
raven
hover
about
a
carcase
,
and
even
ply
for
employment
,
like
sculler
at
Hungerford
-
stair
.
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
them
have
correspondent
in
London
,
who
make
it
their
business
to
inquire
into
the
history
,
character
,
and
distemper
of
every
one
that
repair
to
Bath
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
water
;
and
if
they
can
not
procure
interest
to
recommend
their
medical
friend
to
these
patient
,
before
they
set
out
,
they
at
least
furnish
them
with
a
previous
account
of
what
they
could
collect
,
that
their
correspondent
may
use
this
intelligence
for
their
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
,
and
the
assistance
of
flattery
and
assurance
,
they
often
insinuate
themselves
into
the
acquaintance
of
stranger
,
and
by
consult
their
disposition
,
become
necessary
and
subservient
to
their
prevail
passion
.
<EOS>
by
their
connexion
with
apothecary
and
nurse
,
they
be
inform
of
all
the
private
occurrence
in
each
family
;
and
therefore
,
enable
to
gratify
the
rancour
of
malice
,
amuse
the
spleen
of
peevish
indisposition
,
and
entertain
the
eagerness
of
impertinent
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
these
occupation
,
which
frequently
affect
the
reputation
of
our
two
adventurer
,
this
whole
body
fall
under
the
displeasure
of
our
hero
,
who
,
after
diver
consultation
with
his
friend
,
concert
a
stratagem
,
which
be
practise
upon
the
faculty
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
among
those
who
frequent
the
pumproom
,
be
an
old
officer
,
whose
temper
,
naturally
impatient
,
be
,
by
repeat
attack
of
the
gout
,
which
have
almost
deprive
him
of
the
use
of
his
limb
,
sublimate
into
a
remarkable
degree
of
virulence
and
perverseness
:
he
impute
the
inveteracy
of
his
distemper
to
the
male
practice
of
a
surgeon
who
have
administer
to
him
,
while
he
labour
under
the
consequence
of
an
unfortunate
amour
;
and
this
supposition
have
inspire
him
with
an
insurmountable
antipathy
to
all
the
professor
of
the
medical
art
,
which
be
more
and
more
confirm
by
the
information
of
a
friend
at
London
,
who
have
tell
him
,
that
it
be
a
common
practice
among
the
physician
at
Bath
,
to
dissuade
their
patient
from
drink
the
water
,
that
the
cure
,
and
of
consequence
their
attendance
,
may
be
the
longer
protract
.
    
<EOS>
thus
prepossess
,
he
have
come
to
Bath
,
and
,
conformable
to
a
few
general
instruction
he
have
receive
,
use
the
water
without
any
farth
direction
,
take
all
occasion
of
manifest
his
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
son
of
Aesculapius
,
both
by
speech
and
gesticulation
,
and
even
by
pursue
a
regiman
quite
contrary
to
that
which
he
know
they
prescribe
to
other
,
who
seem
to
be
exactly
in
his
condition
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
find
his
account
in
this
method
,
how
successful
soever
it
may
have
be
in
other
case
.
<EOS>
His
complaint
,
instead
of
vanish
,
be
every
day
more
and
more
enraged
;
and
at
length
he
be
confine
to
his
bed
,
where
he
lie
blaspheme
from
morn
to
night
,
and
from
night
to
morn
,
though
still
more
determined
than
ever
to
adhere
to
his
former
maxim
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
his
torture
,
which
be
become
the
common
joke
of
the
town
,
be
circulate
through
the
industry
of
the
physician
,
who
triumph
in
his
disaster
;
Peregrine
,
by
mean
of
Mr
Pipes
,
employ
a
country
-
fellow
,
who
have
come
to
market
,
to
run
with
great
haste
,
early
one
morning
,
to
the
lodging
of
all
the
doctor
in
town
,
and
desire
them
to
attend
the
colonel
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
summon
,
the
whole
faculty
put
themselves
in
motion
;
and
three
of
the
foremost
arriving
at
the
same
instant
of
time
,
far
from
compliment
one
another
with
the
door
,
each
separately
essay
to
enter
,
and
the
whole
triumvirate
stick
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
while
they
remain
thus
wedge
together
,
they
descry
two
of
their
brother
post
towards
the
same
goal
,
with
all
the
speed
that
God
have
enable
them
to
exert
;
upon
which
they
come
to
a
parley
,
and
agree
to
stand
by
one
another
.
<EOS>
this
covenant
be

themselves

about
the
patient

tell
by
the
servant
,
that
he
have
just
fall
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
have
receive
this
intelligence
,
they
take
possession
of
his
anti
-
chamber
,
and
shut
the
door
,
while
the
rest
of
the
tribe
post
themselves
on
the
outside
,
as
they
arrive
;
so
that
the
whole
passage
be
fill
,
from
the
top
of
the
stair
-
case
to
the
street
-
door
;
and
the
people
of
the
house
,
together
with
the
colonel
's
servant
,
strike
dumb
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
the
three
leader
of
this
learn
gang
have
no
sooner
make
their
lodgment
good
,
than
they
begin
to
consult
about
the
patient
's
malady
,
which
every
one
of
them
pretend
to
have
consider
with
great
care
and
assiduity
.
<EOS>
the
first
who
give
his
opinion
,
say
,
the
distemper
be
an
obstinate
arthritis
;
the
second
affirmed
,
that
it
be
no
other
than
a
confirm
pox
;
and
the
third
swore
it
be
an
inveterate
scurvy
.
    
<EOS>
this
diversity
of
opinion
be
support
by
a
variety
of
quotation
from
medical
author
,
ancient
as
well
as
modern
:
but
these
be
not
of
sufficient
authority
,
or
at
least
not
explicit
enough
to
decide
the
dispute
;
for
there
be
many
schism
in
medicine
,
as
well
as
in
religion
,
and
each
sect
can
quote
the
father
,
in
support
of
the
tenet
they
profess
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
contention
rise
to
such
a
pitch
of
clamour
,
as
not
only
alarm
their
brother
on
the
stair
,
but
also
wake
the
patient
from
the
first
nap
he
have
enjoy
in
the
space
of
ten
whole
day
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
simply
wake
,
he
would
have
be
oblige
to
them
for
the
noise
that
disturb
him
;
for
,
in
that
case
,
he
would
have
be
relieve
from
the
torture
of
hell
-
fire
,
to
which
,
in
his
dream
,
he
fancy
himself
expose
:
but
this
dreadful
vision
have
be
the
result
of
that
impression
which
be
make
upon
his
brain
,
by
the
intolerable
anguish
of
his
joint
;
so
that
,
when
he
wake
,
the
pain
,
instead
of
be
allay
,
be
rather
aggravate
by
a
great
acuteness
of
sensation
;
and
the
confused
vociferation
in
the
next
room
,
invade
his
ear
at
the
same
time
,
he
begin
to
think
his
dream
be
realize
;
and
,
in
the
pang
of
despair
,
apply
himself
to
a
bell
that
stand
by
his
bed
-
side
,
which
he
ring
with
great
violence
and
perseverance
.
    
<EOS>
this
alarm
put
an
immediate
stop
to
the
disputation
of
the
three
doctor
,
who
,
upon
this
notice
of
his
be
awake
,
rush
into
his
chamber
without
ceremony
;
and
each
seize
an
arm
,
the
third
make
the
like
application
to
one
of
his
temple
.
    
<EOS>
before
the
patient
could
recollect
himself
from
the
amazement
which
have
lay
hold
on
him
,
at
this
unexpected
irruption
,
the
room
be
fill
by
the
rest
of
the
faculty
,
who
follow
the
servant
that
enter
,
in
obedience
to
his
master
's
call
;
and
the
bed
be
,
in
a
moment
,
surround
by
these
gaunt
minister
of
death
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
,
see
himself
beset
with
such
an
assemblage
of
solemn
visage
and
figure
,
which
he
have
always
consider
with
the
utmost
detestation
and
abhorrence
,
be
incense
to
a
most
inexpressible
degree
of
indignation
;
and
so
inspirited
by
his
rage
,
that
though
his
tongue
deny
its
office
,
his
other
limb
perform
their
function
;
he
disengage
himself
from
the
triumvirate
,
who
have
take
possession
of
his
body
,
spring
out
of
bed
with
incredible
agility
,
and
seize
one
of
his
crutch
,
apply
it
so
effectually
to
one
of
the
three
,
just
as
he
stoop
to
examine
the
patient
's
water
,
that
his
tye
-
periwig
drop
into
the
pot
,
while
he
himself
fall
motionless
on
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
this
significant
explanation
disconcert
the
whole
fraternity
;
every
man
turn
his
face
,
as
if
it
be
by
instinct
,
towards
the
door
;
and
the
retreat
of
the
community
be
obstruct
by
the
effort
of
individual
,
confusion
and
tumultuous
uproar
ensue
:
for
the
colonel
,
far
from
limit
his
prowess
to
the
first
exploit
,
handle
his
weapon
with
astonishing
vigour
and
dexterity
,
without
respect
of
person
;
so
that
few
or
none
of
them
have
escape
without
mark
of
his
displeasure
,
when
his
spirit
fail
,
and
he
sink
down
again
,
quite
exhausted
,
on
his
bed
.
<EOS>
favour
by
this
respite
,
the
discomfited
faculty
collect
their
hat
and
wig
,
which
have
fall
off
in
the
fray
;
and
perceive
the
assailant
too
much
enfeeble
to
renew
the
attack
,
set
up
their
throat
together
,
and
loudly
threaten
to
prosecute
him
severely
for
such
an
outrageous
assault
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
landlord
have
interpose
;
and
inquire
into
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
,
be
inform
of
what
have
happen
by
the
complainant
,
who
,
at
the

time
,
give
him
to
understand

that
they
have
be

to
attend
the
colonel
that
morning
,
he

that
they

Thunderstruck

this
declaration

the
general
clamour

the
nature
of
the
joke
,
they
sneak
silently
off
with
the
loss
they
have
sustain

in
unutterable
shame
and
mortification
;
while
Peregrine
and
his
friend
,
who
take
care
to
be
pass
that
way
by
accident
,
make
a
full
stop
at

of
such
an
extraordinary
efflux

the
countenance
and

of
every

<EOS>
nay

even
make
up
to
some
of
those
who
seem
most
affected
with
their
situation
,
and
mischievously
torment
them
with

this
unusual
congregation

in
consequence
of
the
information
they
receive
from
the
landlord

valet

subject
the
sufferer
to
the
ridicule
of
all
the

<EOS>
as
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
the
author
of

farce
to

themselves

indefatigable
inquiry
of

they

in
a
very
ludicrous
scene
of

<EOS>
Our

among
his
other
remark

have
observe
,
that
in
this
place
there

no
such
utensil
as

and
that
all
the

nor

at
the
usual
time
,
the
cook

maid

at
every

almost
at
the

and
after

with

for
this
dreadful
calamity
;
and
a
second
concert
of

<EOS>
They

Over

chastise
his
insolence
,
be
the
most
rash
and
inconsiderate
step
that
he
could
possibly
have
take
;
but
,
that
he
have
compassion
upon
his
youth
,
and
be
willing
to
spare
him
,
if
he
would
surrender
his
sword
,
and
promise
to
ask
pardon
in
public
for
the
offence
he
have
give
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
be
so
much
exasperate
at
this
unparallelled
effrontery
,
that
,
without
deign
to
make
the
least
reply
,
he
fling
his
own
hat
in
the
proposer
's
face
,
and
renew
the
charge
with
such
undaunted
agility
,
that
the
gamester
,
find
himself
in
manifest
hazard
of
his
life
,
betook
himself
to
his
heel
,
and
flee
homeward
with
incredible
speed
,
be
closely
pursue
by
Peregrine
,
who
have
sheathe
his
sword
,
pelt
him
with
stone
as
he
run
,
and
compel
him
to
go
,
that
same
day
,
into
banishment
from
Bath
,
where
he
have
domineer
so
long
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
atchievement
,
which
be
the
subject
of
astonishment
to
all
the
company
,
who
have
look
upon
the
fugitive
as
a
person
of
heroic
courage
,
our
adventurer
's
reputation
be
render
formidable
in
all
its
circumstance
;
although
he
thereby
disoblige
a
good
many
people
of
fashion
,
who
have
contract
an
intimacy
of
friendship
with
the
exile
,
and
who
resent
his
disgrace
,
as
if
it
have
be
the
misfortune
of
a
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
these
generous
patron
,
however
,
bear
a
very
small
proportion
to
those
who
be
pleased
with
the
event
of
the
duel
;
because
,
in
the
course
of
their
residence
at
Bath
,
they
have
either
be
insult
or
defraud
by
the
challenger
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
instance
of
our
hero
's
courage
unacceptable
to
the
lady
,
few
of
whom
could
now
resist
the
united
force
of
such
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
neither
he
nor
his
friend
Godfrey
would
have
find
much
difficulty
in
pick
up
an
agreeable
companion
for
life
;
but
Gauntlet
's
heart
be
preengage
to
Sophy
;
and
Pickle
,
exclusive
of
his
attachment
to
Emily
,
which
be
strong
than
he
himself
imagine
,
possess
such
a
share
of
ambition
,
as
could
not
be
satisfied
with
the
conquest
of
any
female
he
behold
at
Bath
.
    
<EOS>
His
visit
be
,
therefore
,
promiscuous
,
without
any
other
view
than
that
of
amusement
;
and
though
his
pride
be
flatter
by
the
advance
of
the
fair
whom
he
have
captivate
,
he
never
harbour
one
thought
of
proceed
beyond
the
limit
of
common
gallantry
,
and
carefully
avoid
all
particular
explanation
.
<EOS>
but
,
what
above
all
other
enjoyment
yield
him
the
most
agreeable
entertainment
,
be
the
secret
history
of
character
,
which
he
learn'd
from
a
very
extraordinary
person
,
with
whom
he
become
acquainted
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
be
at
the
house
of
a
certain
lady
,
on
a
visit
-
day
,
he
be
strike
with
the
appearance
of
an
old
man
,
who
no
sooner
enter
the
room
than
the
mistress
of
the
house
very
kindly
desire
one
of
the
wit
present
to
roast
the
old
put
.
<EOS>
this
petit
maitre
,
proud
of
the
employment
,
go
up
to
the
senior
,
who
have
something
extremely
peculiar
and
significant
in
his
countenance
,
and
salute
him
with
diver
fashionable
conge
,
accost
him
in
these
word
:
"
Your
servant
,
you
old
rascal
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
see
you
<EOS>
hang'd
.
<EOS>
I
vow
to
Gad
!
<EOS>
you
look
extremely
shocking
,
with
these
gummy
eye
,
lanthorn
jaw
,
and
toothless
chap
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
squint
at
the
lady
<EOS>
,
you
old
rotten
medlar
?
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
we
understand
your
ogling
;
but
you
must
content
yourself
with
a
cook
-
maid
,
sink
me
!
<EOS>
I
see
you
want
to
sit
.
<EOS>
these
wither'd
shank
of
your
tremble
under
their
burthen
:
<EOS>
but
you
must
have
a
little
patience
,
old
Hirco
;
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
mortify
you
a
little
longer
,
curse
me
!
"
    
<EOS>
the
company
be
so
tickle
with
this
address
,
which
be
deliver
with
much
grimace
and
gesticulation
,
that
they
burst
out
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
,
which
they
father
upon
a
monkey
that
be
chain
in
the
room
;
and
when
the
peal
be
over
,
the
wit
renew
his
attack
,
in
these
word
:
"
I
suppose
you
be
fool
enough
to
think
this
mirth
be
occasion
by
Pug
:
<EOS>
ay
,
there
he
be
;
you
have
good
survey
him
;
he
be
of
your
own
family
,
switch
me
:
but
the
laugh
be
at
your
expence
;
and
you
ought
to
thank
heaven
for
make
you
so
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
while
he
utter
these
ingenious
ejaculation
,
the
old
gentleman
bow
alternately
to
him
and
the
monkey
,
that
seem
to
grin
and
chatter
in
imitation
of
the
beau
,
and
with
an
arch
solemnity
of
visage
,
pronounce
,
"
gentleman
,
as
I
have
not
the
honour
to
understand
your
compliment
,
they
will
be
much
better
bestow
on
each
other
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
seat
himself
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
to
see
the
laugh
return
upon
the
aggressor
,
who
remain
confound
and
abash
,
and
in
a
few
minute
leave
the
room
,
muttering
,
as
he
retire
,
"
the
old
fellow
grow
scurrilous
,
stap
my
breath
.
"
    
<EOS>
while
Peregrine
wonder
in
silence
at
this
extraordinary
scene
,
the
lady
of
the
house
perceive
his
surprize
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
the
ancient
visitant
be
utterly
bereft
of
the
sense
of
hearing
;
that
his
name
be
Cadwallader
Crabtree
;
his
disposition
altogether
misanthropical
;
and
that
he
be
admit
into
company
on
account
of
the
entertainment
he
afford
by
his
sarcastic
observation
,
and
the
pleasant
mistake
to
which
he
be
subject
from
his
infirmity
.
<EOS>
nor
do
our
hero
wait
a
long
time
for
an
illustration
of
this
odd
character
.
<EOS>
every
sentence
he
speak
be
replete
with
gall
;
nor
do
his
satire
consist
in
general
reflection
,
but
in
a
series
of
remark
,
which
have
be
make
through
the
medium
of
a
most
whimsical
peculiarity
of
opinion
.
    
<EOS>
among
those
who
be
present
at
this
assembly
be
a
young
officer
,
who
have
by
dint
of
interest
obtain
a
seat
in
the
low
house
,
think
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
talk
of
affair
of
state
;
and
accordingly
regale
the
company
with
an
account
of
a
secret
expedition
which
the
French
be
busy
in
prepare
;
assure
them
,
that
he
have
it
from
the
mouth
of
the
minister
,
to
whom
it
have
be
transmit
by
one
of
his
agent
abroad
.
<EOS>
in
descant
upon
the
particular
of
the
armament
,
he
observe
,
that
they
have
twenty
ship
of
the
line
,
ready
man
and
victual
at
Brest
,
which
be
destine
for
Toulon
,
where
they
would
be
join
by
as
many
more
;
and
from
thence
proceed
to
the
execution
of
their
scheme
,
which
he
impart
as
a
secret
not
fit
to
be
divulge
.
    
<EOS>
this
piece
of
intelligence
be
communicate
to
all
the
company
,
except
Mr
Crabtree
,
who
suffer
by
his
loss
of
hearing
,
that
cynic
be
soon
after
accost
by
a
lady
,
who
,
by
mean
of
an
artificial
alphabet
,
form
by
a
certain
conjunction
and
disposition
of
the
finger
,
ask
if
he
have
hear
any
extraordinary
news
of
late
?
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
with
his
usual
complaisance
,
reply
,
that
he
suppose
she
take
him
for
a
courier
or
spy
,
by
teize
him
eternally
with
that
question
.
<EOS>
He
then
expatiate
upon
the
foolish
curiosity
of
mankind
,
which
,
he
say
,
must
either
proceed
from
idleness
or
want
of
idea
;
and
repeat
almost
verbatim
the
officer
's
information
,
as
a
vague
ridiculous
report
,
invent
by
some
ignorant
coxcomb
,
who
want
to
give
himself
air
of
importance
,
and
believe
only
by
those
who
be
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
politic
and
strength
of
the
french
nation
.
    
<EOS>
in
confirmation
of
what
he
have
advance
,
he
endeavour
to
demonstrate
how
impossible
it
must
be
for
that
people
to
fit
out
even
the
third
part
of
such
a
navy
,
so
soon
after
the
loss
they
have
sustain
during
the
war
;
and
confirm
his
proof
by
assert
,
that
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
the
harbour
of
Brest
and
Toulon
could
not
at
that
time
produce
a
squadron
of
eight
ship
of
the
line
.
    
<EOS>
the
member
,
who
be
an
utter
stranger
to
this
misanthrope
,
hear
his
own
asseveration
treat
with
such
contempt
,
glow
with
confusion
and
resentment
,
and
raise
his
voice
,
begin
to
defend
his
own
veracity
with
great
eagerness
and
trepidation
,
mingle
with
his
argument
many
bluster
invective
against
the
insolence
and
ill
manner
of
his
suppose
contradictor
,
who
sit
with
the
most
mortifying
composure
of
countenance
,
till
the
officer
's
patience
be
quite
exhausted
;
and
then
,
to
the
manif
increase
of
his
vexation
,
he
be
inform
,
that
his
antagonist
be
so
deaf
,
that
,
in
all
probability
,
the
last
trumpet
would
make
no
impression
upon
him
,
without
a
previous
renovation
of
his
organ

LXXVII
<EOS>
He
cultivate
an
acquaintance
with
the
misanthrope
,
who
favour
him
with
a
short
sketch
of
his
own
history
.
   
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
extremely
well
pleased
at
this
occasional
rebuke
,
which
occur
so
seasonably
,
that
he
could
scarce
believe
it
accidental
.
    
<EOS>
He
look
upon
Cadwallader
as
the
great
curiosity
he
have
ever
know
,
and
cultivate
the
old
man
's
acquaintance
with
such
insinuating
address
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
he
obtain
his
confidence
;
and
as
they
one
day
walk
into
the
field
together
,
the
Manhater
disclos'd
himself
,
in
these
word
:
<EOS>
"
tho
'
the
term
of
our
communication
have
be
but
short
,
you
must
have
perceive
,
that
I
treat
you
with
uncommon
mark
of
regard
;
which
,
I
assure
you
,
be
not
owe
to
your
personal
accomplishment
,
nor
the
pain
you
take
to
oblige
me
;
for
the
first
I
overlook
,
and
the
last
I
see
through
:
but
there
be
something
in
your
disposition
which
indicate
a
root
contempt
for
the
world
,
and
I
understand
you
have
make
some
successful
effort
,
in
expose
one
part
of
it
to
the
ridicule
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
assurance
,
that
I
offer
you
my
advice
and
assistance
,
in
prosecute
other
scheme
of
the
same
nature
;
and
to
convince
you
that
such
an
alliance
be
not
to
be
reject
,
I
will
now
give
you
a
short
sketch
of
my
history
,
which
will
be
publish
after
my
death
,
in
forty
seven
volume
of
my
own
compiling
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
bear
about
forty
mile
from
this
place
,
of
parent
who
have
a
very
old
family
-
name
to
support
,
bestow
their
whole
fortune
on
my
eld
brother
;
so
that
I
inherit
of
my
father
little
else
than
a
large
share
of
choler
,
to
which
I
be
indebte
for
a
great
many
adventure
that
do
not
always
end
to
my
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
eighteen
I
be
send
up
to
town
,
with
a
recommendation
to
a
certain
peer
,
who
find
mean
to
amuse
me
with
the
promise
of
a
commission
,
for
seven
whole
year
;
and
'
tis
odd
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
make
my
fortune
by
my
perseverance
,
have
not
I
be
arrest
,
and
throw
into
the
Marshalsea
by
my
landlord
,
on
whose
credit
I
have
subsist
three
year
,
after
my
father
have
renounce
me
as
an
idle
vagabond
.
<EOS>
there
I
remain
six
month
,
among
those
prisoner
who
have
no
other
support
than
chance
charity
;
and
contract
a
very
valuable
acquaintance
,
which
be
of
great
service
to
me
in
the
future
emergency
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
discharge
,
in
consequence
of
an
act
of
parliament
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtor
,
than
I
go
to
the
house
of
my
creditor
,
whom
I
cudgel
without
mercy
;
and
that
I
may
leave
nothing
undone
of
those
thing
which
I
ought
to
have
do
,
my
next
stage
be
to
Westminster
-
hall
,
where
I
wait
until
my
patron
come
forth
from
the
house
,
and
salute
him
with
a
blow
that
lay
him
senseless
on
the
pavement
:
but
my
retreat
be
not
so
fortunate
as
I
could
have
wish
,
the
chairman
and
lacquie
in
wait
have
surround
and
disarm
me
in
a
trice
,
I
be
commit
to
Newgate
,
and
load
with
chain
;
and
a
very
sagacious
gentleman
,
who
be
afterwards
hang
,
have
sit
in
judgment
upon
my
case
,
pronounce
me
guilty
of
a
capital
crime
,
and
foretold
my
condemnation
at
the
Old
Baily
.
<EOS>
His
prognostic
,
however
,
be
disappoint
;
for
no
body
appear
to
prosecute
me
at
the
next
session
,
I
be
discharge
,
by
order
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
recount
,
in
the
compass
of
one
day
's
conversation
,
<EOS>
all
the
particular
exploit
in
which
I
bear
a
considerable
share
:
suffice
it
to
say
,
I
have
be
,
at
different
time
,
prisoner
in
all
the
jail
within
the
bill
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
I
have
break
from
every
round
-
house
on
this
side
Temple
-
bar
.
    
<EOS>
no
bailiff
,
in
the
day
of
my
youth
and
desperation
,
durst
execute
a
writ
upon
me
without
a
dozen
follower
;
and
the
justice
themselves
tremble
when
I
be
bring
before
them
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
once
maim
by
a
carman
,
with
whom
I
quarrel
,
because
he
ridicule
my
leek
on
St
David
's
day
;
my
skull
be
fracture
by
a
butcher
's
cleaver
,
on
the
like
occasion

<EOS>
I
have
be
run
thro

the
body
five
time
,
and
lose
the
tip
of
my
left
ear
by
a
pistol
bullet
.
<EOS>
in
a
rencounter
of
this
kind
,
have
leave
my
antagonist
for
dead
,
I
be
wise
enough
to
make
my
retreat
into
France
;
and
a
few
day
after
my
arrival
at
Paris
enter
into
conversation
with
some
officer
on
the
subject
of
politic
,
a
dispute
arise
,
in
which
I
lose
my
temper
,
and
speak
so
irreverently
of
the
Grand
Monarque
,
that
next
morning
I
be
send
to
the
bastile
,
by
virtue
of
a
Lettre
de
Cachet
.
<EOS>
there
I
remain
for
some
month
,
deprive
of
all
intercourse
with
rational
creature
;
a
circumstance
for
which
I
be
not
sorry
,
as
I
have
the
more
time
to
project
scheme
of
revenge
against
the
tyrant
who
confine
me
,
and
the
wretch
who
have
betray
my
private
conversation
:
but
tired
,
at
length
,
with
these
fruitless
suggestion
,
I
be
fain
to
unbend
the
severity
of
my
thought
by
a
correspondence
with
some
industrious
spider
,
who
have
hang
my
dungeon
with
their
ingenious
labour
.
    
<EOS>
I
consider
their
work
with
such
attention
,
that
I
soon
become
an
adept
in
the
mystery
of
weaving
,
and
furnish
myself
with
as
many
useful
observation
and
reflection
on
that
art
,
as
will
compose
a
very
curious
treatise
,
which
I
intend
to
bequeath
to
the
Royal
Society
,
for
the
benefit
of
our
woolen
manufacture
;
and
this
with
a
view
to
perpetuate
my
own
name
,
rather
than
befriend
my
country
:
for
,
thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
be
wean
from
all
attachment
of
that
kind
,
and
look
upon
myself
as
one
very
little
oblige
to
any
society
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
although
I
preside
with
absolute
power
over
this
long
-
legg'd
community
,
and
distribute
reward
and
punishment
to
each
,
accord
to
his
desert
,
I
grow
impatient
of
my
situation
;
and
my
natural
disposition
,
one
day
,
prevail
,
like
a
fire
which
have
long
be
smother
,
I
wreak
the
fury
of
my
indignation
upon
my
innocent
subject
,
and
in
a
twinkling
destroy
the
whole
race
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
employ
in
this
general
massacre
,
the
turnkey
,
who
bring
me
food
,
open
the
door
,
and
perceive
my
transport
,
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
leave
my
allowance
,
go
out
,
pronounce
,
Le
pauvre
diable
!
<EOS>
la
tete
lui
tourne
.
<EOS>
My
passion
no
sooner
subside
than
I
resolve
to
profit
by
this
opinion
of
the
jailor
,
and
from
that
day
counterfeit
lunacy
with
such
success
,
that
in
less
than
three
month
I
be
deliver
from
the
bastile
,
and
send
to
the
gallie
,
in
which
they
think
my
bodily
vigour
may
be
of
service
,
although
the
faculty
of
my
mind
be
decay
.
<EOS>
before
I
be
chain
to
the
oar
,
I
receive
three
hundred
stripe
by
way
of
welcome
,
that
I
may
thereby
be
render
more
tractable
,
notwithstanding
I
use
all
the
argument
in
my
power
to
persuade
them
,
I
be
only
mad
north
,
north
west
,
and
when
the
wind
be
southerly
,
know
a
hawk
from
an
hand
-
saw
.
    
<EOS>
in
our
second
cruize
we
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
overtake
by
a
temp
,
during
which
the
slave
be
unbound
,
that
they
may
contribute
the
more
to
the
preservation
of
the
galley
,
and
have
a
chance
for
their
life
,
in
case
of
a
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
We
be
no
sooner
at
liberty
,
than
make
ourselves
master
of
the
vessel
,
we
rob
the
officer
,
and
run
her
on
shore
among
rock
on
the
coast
of
Portugal
;
from
whence
I
hasten
to
Lisbon
,
with
a
view
of
obtain
my
passage
in
some
ship
bind
for
England
,
where
,
by
this
time
,
I
hope
my
affair
would
be
forget
.
    
<EOS>
but
before
this
scheme
could
be
accomplish
,
my
evil
genius
lead
me
into
company
;
and
be
intoxicate
,
I
begin
to
broach
doctrine
on
the
subject
of
religion
,
at
which
some
of
the
partie
be
scandalize
and
incensed
;
and
I
be
next
day
drag
out
of
bed
by
the
officer
of
the
inquisition
,
and
convey
to
a
cell
in
the
prison
belong
to
that
tribunal
.
    
<EOS>
at
my
first
examination
my
resentment
be
strong
enough
to
support
me
under
the
torture
,
which
I
endure
without
flinch
;
but
my
resolution
abate
,
and
my
zeal
immediately
cool
,
when
I
understand
from
a
fellow
-
prisoner
,
who
groan
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
,
that
in
a
short
time
there
would
be
an
Auto
da
fe
;
in
consequence
of
which
I
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
doom
to
the
flame
,
if
I
would
not
renounce
my
heretical
error
,
and
submit
to
such
penance
as
the
church
should
think
fit
to
prescribe
.
<EOS>
this
miserable
wretch
be
convict
of
Judaism
,
which
he
have
privately
practise
,
by
connivance
,
for
many
year
,
until
he
have
amass
a
fortune
sufficient
to
attract
the
regard
of
the
church
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
he
fall
a
sacrifice
,
and
accordingly
prepare
himself
for
the
stake
;
while
I
,
not
at
all
ambitious
of
the
crown
of
martyrdom
,
resolve
to
temporize
:
so
that
,
when
I
be
bring
to
the
question
the
second
time
,
I
make
a
solemn
recantation
;
and
,
as
I
have
no
worldly
fortune
to
obstruct
my
salvation
,
be
receive
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
,
and
,
by
way
of
penance
,
enjoin
to
walk
barefoot
to
Rome
,
in
the
habit
of
a
pilgrim
.
    
<EOS>
during
my
peregrination
thro
'
Spain
,
I
be
detain
as
a
spy
,
until
I
could
procure
credential
from
the
inquisition
at
Lisbon
;
and
behave
with
such
resolution
and
reserve
,
that
,
after
be
release
,
I
be
deem
a
proper
person
to
be
employ
in
quality
of
a
secret
intelligencer
,
at
a
certain
court
.
<EOS>
this
office
I
undertake
,
without
hesitation
;
and
be
furnish
with
money
and
bill
of
credit
,
cross
the
Pyrenees
,
with
intention
to
revenge
myself
upon
the
Spaniard
for
the
severity
I
have
undergo
,
during
my
captivity
.
    
<EOS>
have
therefore
effectually
disguise
myself
,
by
a
change
of
dress
,
and
a
large
patch
on
one
eye
,
I
hire
an
equipage
,
and
appear
at
Bologna
,
in
quality
of
an
itinerant
physician
;
in
which
capacity
I
succeed
tolerably
well
,
till
my
servant
decamp
in
the
night
,
with
my
baggage
,
and
leave
me
in
the
condition
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
travel
over
the
great
part
of
Europe
,
as
a
beggar
,
pilgrim
,
priest
,
soldier
,
gamester
,
and
quack
;
and
feel
the
extreme
of
indigence
and
opulence
,
with
the
inclemency
of
weather
,
in
all
its
vicissitude
.
<EOS>
I
have
learn
that
the
character
of
mankind
be
every
where
the
same
;
that
common
sense
and
honesty
bear
an
infinitely
small
proportion
to
folly
and
vice
;
and
that
life
be
at
good
a
paulty
province

<EOS>
after
have
suffer
innumerable
hardship
,
danger
,
and
disgrace

I
return
to
London
,
where
I
live
some
year
in
a
garret

and
pick
up
a
subsistence
,
such
as
it
be
,
by
vend
purge
in
the
street
,
from
the
back
of
a

in

situation
I

,
<EOS>
in

he
would
not

part
with
a
six

pence

to
save
my
soul

body
from
perdition

<EOS>
I
now
appear
in
the
world
,
not
as
a
member
of
any
community

or
what
be
call
a

merely
as
a

himself
with
the

of

pudding
,
and
banquet
his
spleen
in

his
enemy
at

<EOS>
that
I
may
enjoy
this
disposition
,
abstract
from
all
interruption
,
danger
,
and
participation
,
I
feign
myself
deaf
;
an
expedient
by
which
I
not
only
avoid
all
dispute

and
their
consequence
,
but
also
become
master
of
a
thousand
little

how
I
handle
that
shallow

in
no

they

which
(
if

would

<EOS>
by

<EOS>
so
precious

shyness

and
regard
him
attentively
for
some
minute
;
"
if
this
declaration
(
say
she
)
be
an
effort
of
your
delicacy
,
you
may
spare
such
ridiculous
reserve
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
when
thing
be
come
to
a
certain
pass
,
such
ceremony
be
superfluous
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
remember
your
good
fortune
with
regret
,
and
actually
wish
you
have
meet
with
that
adventure
<EOS>
you
have
be
at
such
pain
to
feign
,
rather
than
have
enjoy
so
cheap
a
conquest
.
<EOS>
indeed
you
be
so
impatient
to
be
go
before
morning
,
that
you
seem
rather
tired
of
your
stay
,
than
sollicitous
about
my
reputation
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
trooper
,
amazed
and
alarm
at
this
unexpected
address
,
swear
with
many
vulgar
execration
,
that
he
could
prove
he
be
in
custody
from
twelve
till
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
that
he
begin
to
perceive
he
have
be
finely
fling
by
some
rascal
,
who
have
visit
her
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
even
hint
a
suspicion
,
that
the
whole
affair
have
be
transact
by
her
connivance
;
and
become
extremely
rough
and
unmannerly
in
his
expostulation
:
so
that
the
lady
,
who
have
more
of
the
tygress
than
of
the
lamb
in
her
disposition
,
be
exasperate
at
the
freedom
of
his
behaviour
,
order
him
down
stair
,
and
(
to
use
the
common
phrase
)
forbad
him
her
house
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
retire
,
not
without
many
invective
and
threat
,
which
he
bawl
aloud
in
his
march
;
while
his
incensed
patroness
,
by
this
time
sensible
that
she
have
be
the
dupe
of
some
stratagem
,
remain
in
a
state
of
unspeakable
anxiety
and
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
be
bless
,
however
,
with
a
great
share
of
penetration
,
she
forthwith
set
it
at
work
;
and
,
after
some
recollection
,
conclude
that
the
substitute
could
be
no
other
than
Peregrine
,
who
have
either
learn
the
circumstance
of
the
assignation
from
her
maid
,
or
extract
them
from
the
vanity
and
indiscretion
of
the
gallant
himself
.
    
<EOS>
now
that
she
have
an
opportunity
of
be
acquaint
with
all
our
young
gentleman
's
qualification
,
she
do
not
repine
at
the
qui
pro
quo
which
have
be
play
upon
her
,
and
resolve
to
transfer
her
good
grace
to
Peregrine
,
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
she
favour
him
with
the
most
palpable
advance
and
allusion
,
which
he
would
not
understand
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
convey
the
ring
to
her
in
a
letter
,
write
in
a
counterfeit
character
,
with
a
feign
name
,
importing
,
that
as
he
have
reason
to
believe
the
token
be
intend
for
another
,
he
could
not
in
conscience
reserve
it
for
his
own
use
:
and
to
crown
her
vexation
,
by
his
contrivance
,
every
circumstance
of
the
story
be
divulge
,
except
the
name
of
the
person
who
have
represent
the
lover
.
    
<EOS>
while
our
adventurer
thus
enjoy
his
disposition
,
he
be
summon
to
the
castle
by
an
express
from
his
friend
Hatchway
,
represent
that
the
commodore
lie
at
the
point
of
death
;
and
in
less
than
an
hour
after
the
receipt
of
this
melancholy
piece
of
news
,
he
set
out
post
for
his
uncle
's
habitation
,
have
previously
take
leave
of
his
associate
Crabtree
,
who
promise
to
meet
him
in
two
month
at
London
,
and
settle
a
correspondence
with
Gauntlet
,
who
propose
to
remain
at
Bath
during

of

Chapter
LXXIX
   
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
our
hero
arrive
at
the
garison
,
where
he
find
his
generous
uncle
in
extremity
,
support
in
bed
,
by
Julia
on
one
side
,
and
lieutenant
Hatchway
on
the
other
;
while
Mr
Jolter
administer
spiritual
consolation
to
his
soul
,
and
between
while
comfort
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
,
with
her
maid
,
sit
by
the
fire
,
weep
with
great
decorum
;
the
physician
have
just
take
his
last
fee
,
and
retire
,
after
pronounce
the
fatal
prognostic
,
in
which
he
anxiously
wish
he
may
not
be
mistake
.
    
<EOS>
though
the
commodore
's
speech
be
interrupt
by
a
violent
hiccup
,
he
still
retain
the
use
of
his
sense
;
and
when
Peregrine
approach
,
stretch
out
his
hand
with
manifest
sign
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
whose
heart
overflow
with
gratitude
and
affection
,
could
not
behold
such
a
spectacle
,
unmoved
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
conceal
his
tenderness
,
which
in
the
wildness
of
his
youth
,
and
in
the
pride
of
his
disposition
,
he
consider
as
a
derogation
from
his
manhood
;
but
,
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavour
,
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
,
while
he
kiss
the
old
man
's
hand
;
and
he
be
so
utterly
disconcert
by
his
grief
,
that
when
he
attempt
to
speak
,
his
tongue
deny
its
office
:
so
that
the
commodore
,
perceive
his
disorder
,
make
a
last
effort
of
strength
,
and
console
him
in
these
word
:
<EOS>
"
swab
the
spray
from
your
bowsprit
,
my
good
lad
,
and
coil
up
your
spirit
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
let
the
top
-
lift
of
your
heart
give
way
,
because
you
see
me
ready
to
go
down
at
these
year
;
many
a
well
man
have
founder
before
he
have
make
half
my
way
;
thof
I
trust
,
by
the
mercy
of
God
,
I
shall
be
sure
in
port
in
a
very
few
glass
,
and
fast
moor
in
a
most
blessed
riding
:
for
my
good
friend
Jolter
hath
overhaul
the
journal
of
my
sin
;
and
by
the
observation
he
hath
take
of
the
state
of
my
soul
,
I
hope
I
shall
happily
conclude
my
voyage
,
and
be
bring
up
in
the
latitude
of
heaven
.
    
<EOS>
here
have
be
a
doctor
that
want
to
stow
me
chock
-
full
of
physic
;
but
,
when
a
man
's
hour
be
come
,
what
signify
his
take
his
departure
with
a
'
pothecary
's
shop
in
his
hold
?
<EOS>
those
fellow
come
along
side
of
die
man
,
like
the
messenger
of
the
admiralty
with
sailing
order
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
tell
him
as
how
I
could
slip
my
cable
without
his
direction
or
assistance
,
and
so
he
haul
off
in
dudgeon
.
<EOS>
this
curse
hiccup
(
damnation
seize
it
)
make
such
a
rippling
in
the
current
of
my
speech
,
that
mayhap
you
do
not
understand
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
now
,
while
the
sucker
of
my
wind
pump
will
go
,
I
would
willingly
mention
a
few
thing
,
which
I
hope
you
will
set
down
in
the
log
-
book
of
your
remembrance
,
when
I
be
stiff
,
d'ye
see
.
<EOS>
there
be
your
aunt
sit
whimpering
by
the
fire
,
I
desire
you
will
keep
her
tight
,
warm
,
and
easy
in
her
old
age
;
she
be
an
honest
heart
in
her
own
way
,
and
thof
<EOS>
she
go
a
little
crank
and
humoursome
,
by
be
often
over
-
stow
with
nantz
and
religion
,
she
have
be
a
faithful
ship
-
mate
to
me
,
and
I
dare
say
never
turn
in
with
another
man
,
since
we
first
embark
in
the
same
bottom
.
<EOS>
Jack
Hatchway
,
you
know
the
trim
of
her
as
well
as
e'er
a
man
in
England
,
and
I
believe
she
have
a
kindness
for
you
;
whereby
,
if
you
two
will
grapple
in
the
way
of
matrimony
,
when
I
be
go
,
I
do
suppose
,
that
my
godson
,
for
love
of
me
,
will
allow
you
to
live
in
the
garison
all
the
day
of
your
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
assure
him
,
he
would
with
pleasure
comply
with
any
request
he
should
make
,
in
behalf
of
two
person
whom
he
esteem
so
much
;
and
the
lieutenant
,
with
a
waggish
sneer
,
which
even
the
gravity
of
the
situation
could
not
prevent
,
thank
them
both
for
their
good
will
,
tell
the
commodore
,
he
be
oblige
to
him
for
his
friendship
,
in
seek
to
promote
him
to
the
command
of
a
vessel
which
he
himself
have
wear
out
in
the
service
:
that
notwithstanding
,
he
should
be
content
to
take
charge
of
her
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
could
not
help
be
shy
of
come
after
such
an
able
navigator
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
,
exhaust
as
he
be
,
smile
at
this
sally
,
and
after
some
pause
,
resume
his
admonition
in
this
manner
:
"
I
need
not
talk
of
Pipes
,
because
I
know
you
will
do
for
him
,
without
my
recommendation
;
the
fellow
have
sail
with
me
in
many
a
hard
gale
,
and
I
will
warrant
him
as
stout
a
seaman
as
ever
set
face
to
the
weather
:
but
I
hope
you
will
take
care
of
the
rest
of
my
crew
,
and
not
disrate
them
after
I
be
dead
,
in
favour
of
new
follower
.
<EOS>
as
for
that
young
woman
,
Ned
Gauntlet
's
daughter
,
I
be
inform
as
how
she
be
an
excellent
wench
,
and
have
a
respect
for
you
;
whereby
,
if
you
run
her
on
board
in
an
unlawful
way
,
I
leave
my
curse
upon
you
,
and
trust
you
will
never
prosper
in
the
voyage
of
life
:
but
,
I
believe
you
be
more
of
an
honest
man
,
than
to
behave
so
much
like
a
pirate
.
<EOS>
I
beg
of
all
love
,
you
wool
take
care
of
your
constitution
,
and
beware
of
run
foul
of
harlot
,
who
be
no
well
than
so
many
mermaid
,
that
sit
upon
rock
in
the
sea
,
and
hang
out
a
fair
face
for
the
destruction
of
passenger
;
thof
I
must
say
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
never
meet
with
any
of
those
sweet
singer
,
and
yet
I
have
go
to
sea
for
the
space
of
thirty
year
.
<EOS>
but
,
howsomever
,
steer
your
course
clear
of
all
such
brimstone
bitch
;
shun
go
to
law
as
you
would
shun
the
devil
,
and
look
upon
all
attornie
as
devour
shark
,
or
ravenous
fish
of
prey
.
    
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
breath
be
out
of
my
body
,
let
minute
gun
be
fire
,
till
I
be
safe
under
ground
:
I
would
also
be
bury
in
the
red
jacket
I
have
on
,
when
I
board
and
take
the
Renummy
.
<EOS>
let
my
pistol
,
cutlass
,
and
pocket
-
compass
be
lay
in
the
coffin
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
let
me
be
carry
to
the
grave
by
my
own
man
,
dress
in
the
black
cap
and
white
shirt
which
my
barge
's
crew
be
will
not
to
wear
;
and
they
must
keep
a
good
lookout
,
that
none
of
your
pilfer
rapscallion
may
come
and
heave
me
up
again
,
for
the
lucre
of
what
they
can
get
,
until
my
carcase
be
belay
by
a
tomb
-
stone
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
motto
,
or
what
you
call
it
,
I
leave
that
to
you
and
Mr
Jolter
,
who
be
scholar
;
but
I
do
desire
,
that
it
may
not
be
ingrave
in
the
greek
or
latin
lingo
,
and
much
less
in
the
French
,
which
I
abominate
,
but
in
plain
English
,
that
when
the
angel
come
to
pipe
all
hand
at
the
great
day
,
he
may
know
that
I
be
a
british
man
,
and
speak
to
me
in
my
mother
tongue
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
but
God
in
heaven
have
mercy
upon
my
soul
,
and
send
you
all
fair
weather
,
wheresoever
you
be
bind
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
regard
every
individual
around
him
with
a
look
of
complacency
,
and
close
his
eye
,
compose
himself
to
rest
,
while
the
whole
audience
(
Pipes
himself
not
except
)
be
melt
with
sorrow
;
and
Mrs
Trunnion
consent
to
quit
the
room
,
that
she
may
not
be
expose
to
the
unspeakable
anguish
of
see
him
expire
.
    
<EOS>
His
last
moment
,
however
,
be
not
so
near
as
they
imagine
;
he
begin
to
dose
,
and
enjoy
small
interval
of
ease
,
till
next
day
in
the
afternoon
;
during
which
remission
,
he
be
hear
to
pour
forth
many
pious
ejaculation
,
express
his
hope
,
that
,
for
all
the
heavy
cargo
of
his
sin
,
he
should
be
able
to
surmount
the
foothook
-
shrouds
of
despair
,
and
get
aloft
to
the
cross
-
tree
of
God
's
good
favour
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
his
voice
sink
so
low
,
as
not
to
be
distinguish
;
and
have
lain
about
an
hour
,
almost
without
any
perceptible
sign
of
life
,
he
give
up
the
ghost
,
with
a
groan
which
anounce
his
decease
.
    
<EOS>
Julia
be
no
sooner
certify
of
this
melancholy
event
,
than
she
run
to
her
aunt
's
chamber
,
weep
aloud
;
and
immediately
a
very
decent
concert
be
perform
by
the
good
widow
and
her
attendant
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
and
Hatchway
retire
till
the
corpse
should
be
lay
out
;
and
pipe
have
survey
the
body
,
with
a
face
of
rueful
attention
,
"
well
fare
thy
soul
!
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
know
thee
these
five
and
thirty
year
,
and
sure
a
true

<EOS>
many
a
hard
gale
hast
thou
weather
;
but
now
thy
spell
be
all
over
,
and
thy
hull
fairly
lay
up

<EOS>
a
well

I
would
never
desire
to
serve
;
and
who
know
but
I
may
help
to
set
up
thy
standing
rig
in
another
world
?
"
    
<EOS>
all
the
servant
of
the
house
be
affect
with
the
loss
of
their
old
master
,
and
the
poor
people
in
the
neighbourhood
assemble
at
the
gate
,
and
by
repeat
howling
express
their
sorrow
for
the
death
of
their
charitable
benefactor
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
feel
every
thing
which
love
and
gratitude
could
inspire
on
this
occasion
,
be
not
so
much
overwhelmed
with
affliction
,
as
to
be
incapable
of
take
the
management
of
the
family
into
his
own
hand
.
    
<EOS>
He
give
direction
about
the
funeral
with
great
discretion
,
after
have
pay
the
compliment
of
condolance
to
his
aunt
,
whom
he
console
with
the
assurance
of
his
inviolable
esteem
and
affection
.
<EOS>
He
order
suit
of

to
be
make
for
every
person
in
the
garison
,
and
invite
all
the
neighbour
gentleman
to
the
burial
,
not
even
except
his
father
and
brother
Gam
,
who
do
not
,
however
,
honour
the
ceremony
with
their
presence
;
nor
be
his
mother
humane
enough
to
visit
her
sister
-
in

in
her
distress
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
method
of
interment
,
the
commodore
's
injunction
be
obey
to
a
tittle
;
and
at
the
same
time

<EOS>
have
perform
these
obsequie
with
the
most
pious
punctuality
,
he
examine
the
will
,
to
which
there
be
no

since
it
have

of
all
the

,
and
be
sole

,
take

of
the
estate
to
which
he
have
succeed
,
and
which
,
after
all
deduction
,
amount
to
thirty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
the
possession
of
such
a
fortune
,
of
which
he
be
absolute
master
,
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
humiliation
of
his
spirit
,
but
inspire
him
with
new
idea
of
grandeur
and
magnificence
,
and
elevate
his
hope
to
the
high
pinnacle
of
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
His
domestic
affair
be
settle
,
he
be
visit
by
almost
all
the
gentleman
of
the
county
,
who
come
to
pay
their
compliment
of
congratulation
,
on
his
accession
to
the
estate
;
and
some
of
them
offer
their
good
office
towards
a
reconciliation
betwixt
his
father
and
him
,
induce
by
the
general
detestation
which
be
entertain
for
<EOS>
his
brother
Gam
,
who
be
by
this
time
look
upon
by
his
neighbour
as
a
prodigy
of
insolence
and
malice
.
<EOS>
Our
young
squire
thank
them
for
their
kind
proposal
,
which
he
accept
;
and
old
Gamaliel
,
at
their
intreatie
,
seem
very
well
disposed
to
an
accommodation
:
but
,
as
he
would
not
venture
to
declare
himself
,
before
he
have
consult
his
wife
,
that
favourable
disposition
be
render
altogether
ineffectual
,
by
the
instigation
of
that
implacable
woman
;
and
our
hero
resign
all
expectation
of
be
reunite
to
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
His
brother
,
as
usual
,
take
all
opportunity
of
injure
his
character
,
by
false
aspersion
and
story
misrepresent
,
in
order
to
prejudice
his
reputation
:
nor
be
his
sister
Julia
suffer
to
enjoy
her
good
fortune
in
peace
.
<EOS>
have
he
undergo
such
persecution
from
an
alien
to
his
blood
,
the
world
would
have
hear
of
his
revenge
;
but
,
notwithstanding
his
indignation
,
he
be
too
much
tincture
by
the
prejudice
of
consanguinity
,
to
lift
his
arm
in
judgment
against
the
son
of
his
own
parent
;
and
this
consideration
abridge
the
term
of
his
residence
at
the
garison
,
where
he
have
propose
to
stay
for
some
month
.

Chapter
LXXX
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
have
settle
his
domestic
affair
,
arrive
in
London
,
and
set
up
a
gay
equipage
.
<EOS>
He
meet
with
Emilia
,
and
be
introduce
to
her
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
His
aunt
,
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
Julia
and
her
husband
,
take
up
her
quarter
at
the
house
of
that
affectionate
kinswoman
,
who
make
it
her
chief
study
to
comfort
and
cherish
the
disconsolate
widow
;
and
Jolter
,
in
expectation
of
the
living
,
which
be
not
yet
vacant
,
remain
in
garison
,
in
quality
of
land
-
steward
upon
our
hero
's
country
-
estate
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
lieutenant
,
our
young
gentleman
commune
with
him
,
in
a
serious
manner
,
about
the
commodore
's
proposal
of
his
take
Mrs
Trunnion
to
wife
;
and
Jack
,
be
quite
tired
of
the
solitary
situation
of
a
batchelor
,
which
nothing
but
the
company
of
his
old
commander
could
have
enable
him
to
support
so
long
,
far
from
discover
aversion
to
the
match
,
observe
with
an
arch
smile
,
that
it
be
not
the
first
time
he
have
command
a
vessel
in
the
absence
of
Captain
Trunnion
;
and
therefore
,
if
the
widow
be
willing
,
he
would
chearfully
stand
by
her
helm
,
and
,
as
he
hope
the
duty
would
not
be
of
long
continuance
,
do
his
endeavour
to
steer
her
safe
into
the
port
,
where
the
commodore
may
come
on
board
,
and
take
charge
of
her
again
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
declaration
,
it
be
determine
that
Mr
Hatchway
should
make
his
address
to
Mrs
Trunnion
,
as
soon
as
decency
would
permit
her
to
receive
them
;
and
Mr
Clover
and
his
wife
promise
to
exert
their
influence
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
mean
while
,
Jack
be
desire
to
live
at
the
castle
as
usual
,
and
assure
,
that
it
should
be
put
wholly
in
his
possession
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
able
to
accomplish
this
matrimonial
scheme
.
    
<EOS>
when
Peregrine
have
settle
all
these
point
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
he
take
leave
of
all
his
friend
,
and
repair
to
the
great
city
,
purchase
a
new
chariot
and
horse
,
put
Pipes
and
another
lacquey
into
rich
livery
,
take
elegant
lodging
in
Pall
-
mall
,
and
make
a
most
remarkable
appearance
among
people
of
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
this
equipage
,
and
the
gaiety
of
his
personal
deportment
,
that
common
fame
,
which
be
always
a
common
liar
,
represent
him
as
a
young
gentleman
who
have
just
succeed
to
an
estate
of
five
thousand
pound
per
annum
,
by
the
death
of
an
uncle
;
that
he
be
intitle
to
an
equal
fortune
at
the
decease
of
his
own
father
,
exclusive
of
two
considerable
jointure
,
which
would
devolve
upon
him
,
at
the
demise
of
his
mother
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
this
report
(
false
and
ridiculous
as
it
be
)
he
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
contradict
;
not
but
that
he
be
sorry
to
find
himself
so
misrepresented
:
but
his
vanity
would
not
allow
him
to
take
any
step
that
may
diminish
his
importance
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
court
his
acquaintance
,
on
the
supposition
that
his
circumstance
be
actually
as
affluent
as
they
be
say
to
be
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
much
be
he
infatuate
by
this
weakness
,
that
he
resolve
to
encourage
the
deception
,
by
live
up
to
the
report
;
and
accordingly
,
engage
in
the
most
expensive
party
of
pleasure
;
believe
,
that
before
his
present
finance
should
be
exhaust
,
his
fortune
would
be
effectually
make
,
by
the
personal
accomplishment
he
should
have
occasion
to
display
to
the
beau
monde
,
in
the
course
of
his
extravagance
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
vanity
and
pride
be
the
rule
foible
of
our
adventurer
,
who
imagine
himself
sufficiently
qualified
to
retrieve
his
fortune
in
various
shape
,
long
before
he
could
have
any
idea
of
want
or
difficulty
.
    
<EOS>
He
think
he
should
have
it
in
his
power
,
at
any
time
,
to
make
prize
of
a
rich
heiress
,
or
opulent
widow
;
his
ambition
have
already
aspire
to
the
heart
of
a
young
handsome
duchess
dowager
,
to
whose
acquaintance
he
have
find
mean
to
be
introduce
:
or
,
should
matrimony
chance
to
be
unsuitable
to
his
inclination
,
he
never
doubt
,
that
by
the
interest
he
may
acquire
among
the
nobility
,
he
should
be
favour
with
some
lucrative
post
,
that
would
amply
recompense
him
for
the
liberality
of
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
young
man
,
who
entertain
the
same
expectation
,
with
half
the
reason
he
have
to
be
so
presumptuous
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
chimerical
calculation
,
his
passion
for
Emilia
do
not
subside
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
begin
to
rage
to
such
an
inflammation
of
desire
,
that
her
idea
interfere
with
every
other
reflection
,
and
absolutely
disable
him
from
prosecute
the
other
lofty
scheme
which
his
imagination
have
project
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
lay
down
the
honest
resolution
of
visit
her
in
all
the
splendor
of
his
situation
,
in
order
to
practise
upon
her
virtue
with
all
his
art
and
address
,
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
influence
and
fortune
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
effectually
have
his
guilty
passion
<EOS>
absorb'd
<EOS>
his
principle
of
honour
,
conscience
,
humanity
,
and
regard
for
the
commodore
's
last
word
,
that
he
be
base
enough
to
rejoice
at
the
absence
of
his
friend
Godfrey
,
who
be
then
with
his
regiment
in
Ireland
,
could
not
dive
into
his
purpose
,
or
take
measure
for
frustrate
his
vicious
design
.
    
<EOS>
Fraught
with
these
heroic
sentiment
,
he
determine
to
set
out
for
Sussex
in
his
chariot
and
six
,
attend
by
his
valet
de
chambre
and
two
footman
;
and
as
he
be
now
sensible
,
that
in
his
last
essay
he
have
mistake
his
cue
,
he
determine
to
change
his
battery
,
and
sap
the
fortress
,
by
the
most
submissive
,
soft
,
and
insinuate
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
evening
that
precede
this
purpose
expedition
,
he
go
into
one
of
the
box
at
the
play
-
house
,
as
usual
,
to
shew
himself
to
the
lady
;
and
in
reconnoitre
the
company
through
a
glass
,
(
for
no
other
reason
,
but
because
it
be
fashionable
to
be
purblind
)
perceive
his
mistress
very
plainly
dress
,
in
one
of
the
seat
above
the
stage
,
talk
to
another
young
woman
of
a
very
homely
appearance
.
<EOS>
though
his
heart
beat
the
alarm
with
the
utmost
impatience
at
sight
of
his
Emilia
,
he
be
for
some
minute
deter
from
obey
the
impulse
of
his
love
,
by
the
presence
of
some
lady
of
fashion
,
who
,
he
fear
,
would
think
the
bad
of
him
,
should
they
see
him
make
his
compliment
in
public
to
a
person
of
her
figure
.
<EOS>
nor
would
the
violence
of
his
inclination
have
so
far
prevail
over
his
pride
,
as
to
lead
him
thither
,
have
not
he
recollect
,
that
his
quality
-
friend
would
look
upon
her
as
some
handsome
Abigail
,
with
whom
he
have
an
affair
of
gallantry
,
and
of
consequence
give
him
credit
for
the
intrigue
.
    
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
suggestion
,
he
comply
with
the
dictate
of
love
,
and
fly
to
the
place
where
his
charmer
sit
.
<EOS>
His
air
and
dress
be
so
remarkable
,
that
it
be
almost
impossible
he
should
have
escape
the
eye
of
a
curious
observer
,
especially
as
he
have
choose
a
time
for
come
in
,
when
his
entrance
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
spectator
;
I
mean
,
when
the
whole
house
be
hush
in
attention
to
the
performance
on
the
stage
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
therefore
,
have
perceive
him
at
his
first
approach
;
she
find
herself
discover
by
the
direction
of
his
glass
,
and
guess
his
intention
by
his
abrupt
retreat
from
the
box
,
summon
all
her
fortitude
to
her
aid
,
and
prepare
for
his
reception
.
<EOS>
He
advance
to
her
with
an
air
of
eagerness
and
joy
,
temper
with
modesty
and
respect
,
and
express
his
satisfaction
at
see
her
,
with
a
seeming
reverence
of
regard
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
extremely
well
pleased
at
this
unexpected
behaviour
,
she
suppress
the
emotion
of
her
heart
,
and
answer
his
compliment
with
affected
ease
and
unconcern
,
such
as
may
denote
the
good
humour
of
a
person
who
meet
by
accident
with
an
indifferent
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
after
have
certify
himself
of
her
own
good
health
,
he
very
kindly
inquire
about
her
mother
and
Miss
Sophy
,
give
her
to
understand
,
that
he
have
lately
be
favour
with
a
letter
from
Godfrey
,
and
that
he
have
actually
intend
to
set
out
next
morning
on
a
visit
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
which
(
now
that
he
be
so
happy
as
to
meet
with
her
)
he
would
postpone
,
until
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
attend
her
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
after
have
thank
him
for
his
polite
intention
,
she
tell
him
,
that
her
mother
be
expect
in
town
in
a
few
day
,
and
that
she
herself
have
come
to
London
some
week
ago
,
to
give
her
attendance
upon
her
aunt
,
who
have
be
dangerously
ill
,
but
be
now
pretty
well
recover
.
    
<EOS>
although
the
conversation
of
course
turn
upon
general
topic
,
during
the
entertainment
,
he
take
all
opportunity
of
be
particular
with
his
eye
,
through
which
he
convey
a
thousand
tender
protestation
.
<EOS>
She
see
,
and
inwardly
rejoice
at
the
humility
of
his
look
;
but
,
far
from
reward
it
with
one
approve
glance
,
she
industriously
avoid
this
ocular
intercourse
,
and
rather
coquet
with
a
young
gentleman
that
ogle
her
from
the
opposite
box
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
penetration
easily
detect
her
sentiment
,
and
he
be
nettle
at
her
dissimulation
,
which
serve
to
confirm
him
in
his
unwarrantable
design
upon
her
person
.
<EOS>
He
persist
in
his
assiduity
with
indefatigable
perseverance
;
when
the
play
be
conclude
,
hand
her
and
her
companion
to
an
hackney
-
coach
,
and
with
difficulty
be
permit
to
escort
them
to
the
house
of
Emilia
's
uncle
,
to
whom
our
hero
be
introduce
by
the
young
lady
,
as
an
intimate
friend
of
her
brother
Godfrey
.
    
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
who
be
no
stranger
to
the
nature
of
Peregrine
's
connexion
with
his
sister
's
family
,
prevail
upon
him
to
stay
supper
,
and
seem
particularly
well
pleased
with
his
conversation
and
deportment
,
which
,
by
help
of
his
natural
sagacity
,
he
wonderfully
adapt
to
the
humour
of
his
entertainer
.
<EOS>
after
supper
,
when
the
lady
be
withdraw
,
and
the
citizen
call
for
his
pipe
,
our
sly
adventurer
follow
his
example
;
and
though
he
abhor
the
plant
,
smoake
with
an
air
of
infinite
satisfaction
,
and
expatiate
upon
the
virtue
of
tobacco
,
as
if
he
have
be
deeply
concerned
in
the
Virginia
trade
.
<EOS>
in
the
progress
of
the
discourse
,
he
consult
the
merchant
's
disposition
;
and
the
national
debt
come
upon
the
carpet
,
hold
forth
upon
the
fund
like
a
professed
broker
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
alderman
complain
of
the
restriction
and
discouragement
of
trade
,
his
guest
inveigh
against
exorbitant
duty
,
with
the
nature
of
which
he
seem
as
well
acquaint
as
any
commissioner
of
the
custom
;
so
that
the
uncle
be
astonish
at
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
,
and
express
his
surprize
,
that
a
gay
young
gentleman
,
like
him
,
should
have
find
either
leisure
or
inclination
to
consider
subject
so
foreign
to
the
fashionable
amusement
of
youth
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
lay
hold
on
this
opportunity
to
tell
him
,
that
he
be
descend
from
a
race
of
merchant
;
and
that
,
early
in
life
,
he
have
make
it
his
business
to
instruct
himself
in
the
different
branch
of
trade
,
which
he
not
only
study
as
his
family
-
profession
,
but
also
as
the
source
of
all
our
national
rich
and
power
.
<EOS>
He
then
launch
out
in
praise
of
commerce
,
and
the
promoter
thereof
;
and
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
employ
all
his
ridicule
,
in
draw
such
ludicrous
picture
of
the
manner
and
education
of
what
be
call
high
life
,
that
the
trader
's
side
be
shake
by
laughter
,
even
to
the
danger
of
his
life
;
and
he
look
upon
our
adventurer
as
a
miracle
of
sobriety
and
good
sense
.
    
<EOS>

his
leave

and
next
day
in
the
forenoon
visit
the
niece
in
his
chariot

after
she
have
be
admonish
by

Chapter
LXXXI
<EOS>
He
prosecute
his
design
upon
Emilia
with
great
art
and
perseverance
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
have
by
his
hypocrisy
obtain
free
access
to
his
mistress
,
begin
the
siege
,
by
profess
the
most
sincere
contrition
for
his
former
levity
,
and
implore
her
forgiveness
with
such
earnest
supplication
,
that
,
guard
as
she
be
against
his
flattering
art
<EOS>
,
she
begin
to
believe
his
protestation
,
which
be
even
accompany
with
tear
,
and
abate
a
good
deal
of
that
severity
and
distance
she
have
propose
to
maintain
,
during
this
interview
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
however
,
favour
him
with
the
least
acknowledgment
of
a
mutual
passion
,
because
,
in
the
midst
of
his
vow
of
eternal
constancy
and
truth
,
he
do
not
mention
one
syllable
of
wedlock
,
though
he
be
now
intirely
master
of
his
own
conduct
;
and
this
consideration
create
a
doubt
,
which
fortify
her
against
all
his
attack
:
yet
,
what
her
discretion
would
have
conceal
,
be
discover
by
her
eye
,
which
,
in
spite
of
all
her
endeavour
,
breathe
forth
complacency
and
love
.
<EOS>
for
,
her
inclination
be
flatter
by
her
own
self
-
sufficiency
,
which
impute
her
admirer
's
silence
,
in
that
particular
,
to
the
hurry
and
perturbation
of
his
spirit
,
and
persuade
her
,
that
he
could
not
possibly
regard
her
with
any
other
than
honourable
intention
.
    
<EOS>
the
insidious
lover
exult
in
the
tenderness
of
her
look
,
from
which
he
presage
a
compleat
victory
:
but
,
that
he
may
not
over
-
shoot
himself
by
his
own
precipitation
,
he
would
not
run
the
risk
of
declare
himself
,
until
her
heart
should
be
so
far
entangle
within
his
snare
,
as
that
neither
the
suggestion
of
honour
,
prudence
,
or
pride
should
be
able
to
disengage
it
.
    
<EOS>
Armed
with
this
resolution
,
he
restrain
the
impatience
of
his
temper
within
the
limit
of
the
most
delicate
deportment
;
and
after
have
solicit
and
obtain
permission
to
attend
her
to
the
next
opera
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
press
it
to
his
lip
in
the
most
respectful
manner
,
go
away
,
leave
her
in
a
most
whimsical
state
of
suspence
,
checquere
with
an
interesting
vicissitude
of
hope
and
fear
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
appoint
day
,
he
appear
again
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
find
her
native
charm
so
much
improve
by
the
advantage
of
dress
,
that
he
be
transport
with
admiration
and
delight
;
and
while
he
conduct
her
to
the
Hay
-
market
,
could
scarce
bridle
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
so
as
to
observe
the
forbear
maxim
he
have
adopt
.
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
pit
,
he
have
abundance
of
food
for
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
;
for
,
in
a
moment
,
she
eclipse
all
the
female
part
of
the
audience
,
each
individual
allow
in
her
own
heart
,
that
the
stranger
be
by
far
the
handsome
woman
there
present
,
except
herself
.
    
<EOS>
here
it
be
that
our
hero
enjoy
a
double
triumph
;
he
be
vain
of
this
opportunity
to
enhance
his
reputation
for
gallantry
among
the
lady
of
fashion
,
who
know
him
,
and
proud
of
an
occasion
to
display
his
quality
-
acquaintance
to
Emilia
,
that
she
may
entertain
the
great
idea
of
the
conquest
she
have
make
,
and
pay
the
more
deference
to
his
importance
in
the
sequel
of
his
address
.
<EOS>
that
he
may
profit
as
much
as
possible
by
this
situation
,
he
go
up
and
accost
every
person
in
the
pit
,
with
whom
he
ever
have
the
least
communication
,
whisper
and
laugh
with
an
affected
air
of
familiarity
,
and
even
bow
at
a
distance
to
some
of
the
nobility
,
on
the
slender
foundation
of
have
stand
near
them
at
court
,
or
present
them
with
a
pinch
of
Rappee
at
White
's
chocolate
-
house
.
    
<EOS>
this
ridiculous
ostentation
,
though
now
practise
with
a
view
of
promote
his
design
,
be
a
weakness
that
,
in
some
degree
,
infect
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
;
for
nothing
give
him
so
much
joy
in
conversation
,
as
an
opportunity
of
give
the
company
to
understand
,
how
well
he
be
with
person
of
distinguished
rank
and
character
:
he
would
often
(
for
example
)
observe
,
as
it
be
occasionally
,
that
the
duke
of
g
#
#
#
#
be
one
of
the
good
natured
man
in
the
world
,
and
illustrate
his
assertion
by
some
instance
of
his
affability
,
<EOS>
in
which
he
himself
be
concern
:
then
,
by
an
abrupt
transition
,
he
would
repeat
some
repartee
of
lady
T
#
#
#
#
,
and
mention
a
certain
bon
mot
of
the
earl
of
c
#
#
#
#
,
which
be
utter
in
his
hearing
.
    
<EOS>
Abundance
of
young
man
,
in
this
manner
,
make
free
with
the
name
,
though
they
have
never
have
access
to
the
person
of
the
nobility
:
<EOS>
but
,
this
be
not
the
case
with
Peregrine
,
who
,
in
consideration
of
his
appearance
and
suppose
fortune
,
together
with
the
advantage
of
his
introduction
,
be
by
this
time
freely
admit
to
the
table
of
the
great
.
    
<EOS>
in
his
return
with
Emilia
from
the
opera
,
though
he
still
maintain
the
most
scrupulous
decorum
in
his
behaviour
,
he
ply
her
with
the
most
passionate
expression
of
love
,
squeeze
her
hand
with
great
fervency
,
protest
that
his
whole
soul
be
ingrosse
by
her
idea
,
and
that
he
could
not
exist
independent
of
her
favour
.
<EOS>
pleased
as
she
be
with
his
warm
and
pathetic
address
,
together
with
the
respectful
manner
of
his
make
love
,
she
yet
have
prudence
and
resolution
sufficient
to
contain
her
tenderness
,
which
be
ready
to
run
over
;
be
fortify
against
his
art
,
by
reflect
,
that
if
his
aim
be
honourable
,
it
be
now
his
business
to
declare
it
.
    
<EOS>
on
this
consideration
,
she
refuse
to
make
any
serious
reply
to
his
earnest
expostulation
,
but
affect
to
receive
them
as
the
undetermined
effusion
of
gallantry
and
good
breeding
.
    
<EOS>
this
fictitious
gaiety
and
good
humour
,
though
it
baffle
his
hope
of
extort
from
her
an
acknowledgment
of
which
he
may
have
take
immediate
advantage
,
nevertheless
encourage
him
to
observe
,
(
as
the
chariot
pass
along
the
Strand
)
that
the
night
be
far
advanced
;
that
supper
would
certainly
be
over
,
before
they
could
reach
her
uncle
's
house
;
and
to
propose
,
that
he
should
wait
upon
her
to
some
place
,
where
they
may
be
accommodate
with
a
slight
refreshment
.
<EOS>
She
be
offend
at
the
freedom
of
this
proposal
,
which
,
however
,
she
treat
as
a
joke
,
thank
him
for
his
courteous
offer
,
and
assure
him
,
that
when
she
should
be
dispose
for
a
tavern
-
treat
,
he
alone
should
have
the
opportunity
of
bestow
it
.
    
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
be
engage
with
company
abroad
,
and
her
aunt
retire
to
rest
,
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
enjoy
a
tte
a
tte
with
her
during
a
whole
hour
,
which
he
employ
with
such
consummate
skill
,
that
her
caution
be
almost
overcome
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
assail
her
with
the
artillery
of
sigh
,
vow
,
prayer
and
tear
,
but
even
pawn
his
honour
in
behalf
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
He
swear
with
many
imprecation
,
that
although
her
heart
be
surrender
to
him
at
discretion
,
there
be
a
principle
within
him
,
which
would
never
allow
him
to
injure
such
innocence
and
beauty
;
and
the
transport
of
his
passion
have
,
upon
this
occasion
,
so
far
overshot
his
purpose
,
that
if
she
have
demand
an
explanation
,
while
he
be
thus
agitate
,
he
would
have
engage
himself
to
her
wish
by
such
tie
,
as
he
could
not
possibly
break
,
with
any
regard
to
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
but
,
from
such
expostulation
,
she
be
deter
partly
by
pride
,
and
partly
by
the
dread
of
find
herself
mistake
in
such
an
interesting
conjecture
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
enjoy
the
present
flattering
appearance
of
her
fate
,
be
prevail
upon
to
accept
the
jewel
which
he
have
purchase
with
part
of
his
winning
at
Bath
,
and
with
the
most
inchanting
condescension
submit
to
a
warm
embrace
,
when
he
take
his
leave
,
after
have
obtain
permission
to
visit
her
,
as
often
as
his
inclination
and
convenience
would
permit
.
    
<EOS>
in
his
return
to
his
own
lodging
,
he
be
buoy
up
with
his
success
to
an
extravagance
of
hope
,
already
congratulate
himself
upon
his
triumph
over
Emilia
's
virtue
,
and
begin
to
project
future
conquest
among
the
most
dignified
character
of
the
female
sex
.
<EOS>
but
his
attention
be
not
at
all
dissipate
by
these
vain
reflection
;
he
resolve
to
concentrate
the
whole
exertion
of
his
soul
upon
the
execution
of
his
present
plan
,
desist
,
in
the
mean
time
,
from
all
other
scheme
of
pleasure
,
interest
and
ambition
,
and
take
lodging
in
the
city
,
for
the
more
commodious
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
while
our
lover
's
imagination
be
thus
agreeably
regale
,
his
mistress
do
not
enjoy
her
expectation
,
without
the
intervention
of
doubt
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
His
silence
touch
the
final
aim
of
his
address
be
a
mystery
on
which
she
be
afraid
of
exercise
her
sagacity
;
and
her
uncle
torment
her
with
inquiry
into
the
circumstance
of
Peregrine
's
profession
and
deportment
.
    
<EOS>
rather
than
give
this
relation
the
least
cause
of
suspicion
,
which
must
have
cut
off
all
intercourse
betwixt
her
and
her
admirer
,
she
say
every
thing
which
she
think
would
satisfy
his
care
and
concern
for
her
welfare
;
and
in
consequence
of
such
representation
,
she
enjoy
,
without
reserve
,
the
company
of
our
adventurer
,
who
prosecute
his
plan
with
surprising
eagerness
and
perseverance
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXXII
He
prevail
upon
Emilia
to
accompany
him
to
a
masquerade
,
make
a
treacherous
attempt
upon
her
affection
,
and
meet
with
a
deserved
repulse
.
   
<EOS>
scarce
a
night
elapse
in
which
he
do
not
conduct
her
to
some
public
entertainment
;
and
when
,
by
dint
of
his
insidious
carriage
,
he
think
himself
in
full
possession
of
her
confidence
and
affection
,
he
lie
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
;
and
hear
her
observe
in
conversation
,
that
she
have
never
be
at
a
masquerade
,
beg
leave
to
attend
her
to
the
next
ball
;
at
the
same
time
,
extend
his
invitation
to
the
young
lady
,
in
whose
company
he
have
find
her
at
the
play
,
she
be
present
when
this
subject
of
discourse
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
He
have
flatter
himself
,
that
this
gentlewoman
would
decline
the
proposal
,
as
she
be
a
person
seemingly
of
a
demure
disposition
,
who
have
be
bear
and
breed
in
the
city
,
where
such
diversion
be
look
upon
as
scene
of
lewdness
and
debauchery
.
<EOS>
for
once
,
however
,
he
reckon
without
his
host
;
curiosity
be
as
prevalent
in
the
city
as
at
the
court
-
end
of
the
town
:
    
Emilia
no
sooner
signify
her
assent
to
his
proposal
,
than
her
friend
,
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
,
agree
to
make
one
of
the
partie
;
and
he
be
oblige
to
thank
her
for
that
complaisance
which
lay
him
under
infinite
mortification
.
<EOS>
He
set
his
genius
at
work
,
to
invent
some
scheme
for
prevent
her
unseasonable
intrusion
.
<EOS>
have
an
opportunity

,
he
would
have
act
as
her
physician
,
and
administer
a
medicine
that
would
have
lay
her
under
the
necessity
of
stay
at
home
:
but
his
acquaintance
with
her
be
too
slight
to
furnish
him
with
the
mean
of
execute
this
expedient
,
he
devise
another
,
which
be
practise
with
all
imaginable
success
.
<EOS>
understand
that
her
grandmother
have
leave
her
a
sum
of
money
independent
of
her
parent
,
he
convey
a
letter
to
her
mother
,

,
that
her
daughter
,
on
pretence
of
go
to
the
masquerade
,
intend
to
bestow
herself
in
marriage
to
a
certain
person
,
and
that
in
a
few
day
she
would
be
inform
of
the
circumstance
of
the
whole
intrigue
,
provide
she
would
keep
this
information
secret
,
and
contrive
some
excuse
for
detain
the
young
lady
at
home
,
without
give
her
cause
to
believe
she
be
apprize
of
her
intention
.

could
not

with
any

and
therefore
send
her
apology
to
Emilia
in
the
afternoon
,
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
Peregrine
,
who
pretend
to
be
very
much
afflict
with
the
disappointment
,
while

they
engage

,
at
which
exercise
they
continue
,
until
our
adventurer
conclude
,
that
his
partner
's
blood
be
sufficiently
warm
for
the
prosecution
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
,
which
be
build
upon
her
declaring
,
that
she
be
thirsty
and
fatigued
,
he
persuade
her
to
take
a
little

and
for
that

,
though
it
be
no
other
than
a

tincture
,
which
he
have
treacherously
provide
for
the
occasion

<EOS>
have
swallow
this
potion
,
by
which
her

be
manifestly
exhilerate
,

a

Emilia

too
much
penetration

a

,
with
an
affected
air
of
serenity
,
for
his
kind
concern

express
her
obligation
to
his
cousin

,
at
the

time

lest

he
assure
her

in

in

fortify

against

revenge

revile
himself
for

trespass
encumber

by
that
time
he
arrive
at
the
citizen
's
gate
,
he
have
con
a
very
artful
and
pathetic
harangue
,
which
he
propose
to
utter
in
his
own
behalf
,
lay
the
blame
of
his
conduct
on
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
incense
by
the
Burgundy
,
which
he
have
too
liberally
drank
:
but
he
do
not
meet
with
an
opportunity
to
avail
himself
of
this
preparation
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
suspect
that
he
would
take
some
step
of
this
kind
to
retrieve
her
favour
,
have
go
abroad
on
pretence
of
visit
,
after
have
signify
to
her
kinsman
,
her
resolution
to
avoid
the
company
of
Peregrine
,
on
account
of
some
ambiguity
which
(
she
say
)
be
last
night
remarkable
in
his
demeanour
,
at
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
She
choose
to
insinuate
her
suspicion
in
these
hint
,
rather
than
give
an
explicit
detail
of
the
young
man
's
dishonourable
contrivance
,
which
may
have
kindle
the
resentment
of
the
family
to
some
dangerous
pitch
of
animosity
and
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
find
himself
baffle
in
his
expectation
of
see
her
,
inquire
for
the
old
gentleman
,
with
whom
he
think
he
have
influence
enough
to
make
his
apology
good
,
in
case
he
should
find
him
prepossess
by
the
young
lady
's
information
.
<EOS>
but
here
too
he
be
disappoint
;
the
uncle
have
go
to
dine
in
the
country
,
and
his
wife
be
indispose
;
so
that
he
have
no
pretext
for
stay
in
the
house
,
till
the
return
of
his
charmer
.
<EOS>
being
,
however
,
fruitful
of
expedient
,
he
dismiss
his
chariot
,
and
take
possession
of
a
room
in
a
tavern
,
the
window
of
which
front
the
merchant
's
gate
;
and
there
he
propose
to
watch
until
he
should
see
her
approach
.
<EOS>
this
scheme
he
put
in
practice
with
indefatigable
patience
,
though
it
be
not
attend
with
the
expect
success
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
whose
caution
be
equally
vigilant
and
commendable
,
foresee
that
she
may
be
expose
to
the
fertility
of
his
invention
,
come
home
by
a
private
passage
,
and
enter
by
a
postern
,
which
be
altogether
unknown
to
her
admirer
;
and
her
uncle
do
not
arrive
,
until
it
be
so
late
,
that
he
could
not
with
any
decency
demand
a
conference
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
he
do
not
fail
to
present
himself
at
the
door
,
and
his
mistress
be
deny
by
her
own
express
direction
,
insist
upon
see
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
receive
him
with
such
coldness
of
civility
,
as
plainly
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
be
acquaint
with
the
displeasure
of
his
niece
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
with
an
air
of
candour
,
tell
the
citizen
,
he
could
easily
perceive
,
by
his
behaviour
,
that
he
be
the
confidant
of
Miss
Emily
,
of
whom
he
be
come
to
ask
pardon
for
the
offence
he
have
give
;
and
do
not
doubt
,
if
he
could
be
admit
to
her
presence
,
that
he
should
be
able
to
convince
her
,
that
he
have
not
err
intentionally
,
or
at
least
propose
such
reparation
,
as
would
effectually
atone
for
his
fault
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
remonstrance
<EOS>
the
merchant
,
without
any
ceremony
or
circumlocution
,
answer
,
that
though
he
be
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
his
offence
,
he
be
very
certain
,
that
it
must
have
be
something
very
flagrant
,
that
could
irritate
his
niece
to
such
a
degree
,
against
a
person
for
whom
she
have
formerly
a
most
particular
regard
.
<EOS>
He
own
,
she
have
declare
her
intention
to
renounce
his
acquaintance
for
ever
,
and
,
doubtless
,
she
have
good
reason
for
so
do
;
neither
would
he
undertake
to
promote
an
accommodation
,
unless
he
would
give
him
full
power
to
treat
on
the
score
of
matrimony
,
which
he
suppose
would
be
the
only
mean
of
evince
his
own
sincerity
,
and
obtain
Emilia
's
forgiveness
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
pride
be
kindle
by
this
blunt
declaration
,
which
he
could
not
help
consider
as
the
result
of
a
scheme
concert
betwixt
the
young
lady
and
her
uncle
,
in
order
to
take
the
advantage
of
his
heat
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
reply
,
with
manifest
sign
of
disgust
,
that
he
do
not
apprehend
there
be
any
occasion
for
a
mediator
to
reconcile
<EOS>
the
difference
betwixt
Emilia
and
him
;
and
that
all
he
desire
,
be
an
opportunity
of
plead
in
his
own
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
the
citizen
frankly
tell
him
,
that
as
his
niece
have
express
an
earnest
desire
of
avoid
his
company
,
he
would
not
put
the
least
constraint
upon
her
inclination
;
and
in
the
mean
time
give
him
to
know
,
that
he
be
particularly
engage
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
glow
with
indignation
at
this
supercilious
treatment
;
"
I
be
in
the
wrong
(
say
he
)
to
look
for
good
manner
,
so
far
on
this
side
of
Temple
-
bar
:
<EOS>
but
,
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
Sir
,
that
unless
I
be
favour
with
an
interview
with
Miss
Gauntlet
,
I
shall
conclude
,
that
you
have
actually
lay
a
constraint
upon
her
inclination
,
for
some
sinister
purpose
of
your
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
reply
the
old
gentleman
)
<EOS>
you
be
welcome
to
make
what
conclusion
shall
seem
good
unto
your
own
imagination
;
but
,
pray
be
so
good
as
to
allow
me
the
privilege
of
be
master
in
my
own
house
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
very
complaisantly
shew
him
to
the
door
;
and
our
lover
,
be
diffident
of
his
own
temper
,
as
well
as
afraid
of
be
use
with
great
indignity
,
in
a
place
where
his
personal
prowess
would
only
serve
to
heighten
his
disgrace
,
quit
the
house
in
a
transport
of
rage
which
he
could
not
wholly
suppress
,
tell
the
landlord
,
that
if
his
age
do
not
protect
him
,
he
would
have
chastise
him
for
his
insolent
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXXIV
<EOS>
He
project
a
violent
scheme
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
be
involve
in
a
most
fatiguing
adventure
,
which
greatly
tend
towards
the
augmentation
of
his
chagrin
.
   
<EOS>
thus
debar
of
personal
communication
with
his
mistress
,
he
essay
to
retrieve
her
good
grace
by
the
most
submissive
and
pathetic
letter
,
which
he
convey
by
<EOS>
diver
artifice
to
her
perusal
;
but
reap
no
manner
of
benefit
from
these
endeavour
,
his
passion
acquire
a
degree
of
impatience
,
little
inferior
to
downright
frenzy
;
and
he
determine
to
run
every
risk
of
life
,
fortune
,
and
reputation
,
rather
than
desist
from
his
unjustifiable
pursuit
.
<EOS>
indeed
his
resentment
be
now
as
deeply
concerned
as
his
love
,
and
each
of
these
passion
equally
turbulent
and
loud
in
demand
gratification
.
<EOS>
He
keep
centinel
continually
in
pay
,
to
give
him
notice
of
her
outgoing
,
in
expectation
of
find
some
opportunity
to
carry
her
off
;
but
her
circumspection
entirely
frustrate
this
design
;
for
she
suspect
every
thing
of
that
sort
from
a
disposition
like
his
,
and
regulate
her
motion
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
baffle
by
her
prudence
and
penetration
,
he
alter
his
plan
,
and
,
on
pretence
of
be
call
to
his
country
-
house
by
some
affair
of
importance
,
he
depart
from
London
,
and
take
lodging
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
that
stand
near
the
road
through
which
she
must
have
necessarily
pass
,
in
her
return
to
her
mother
,
conceal
himself
from
all
intercourse
,
except
with
his
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
,
who
have
order
to
scour
the
country
,
and
reconnoitre
every
horse
,
coach
,
or
carriage
,
that
should
appear
on
that
high
way
,
with
a
view
of
intercept
his
Amanda
in
her
passage
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
wait
in
this
ambuscade
a
whole
week
,
when
his
valet
give
him
notice
,
that
he
and
his
fellow
-
scout
have
discover
a
chaise
and
six
,
drive
at
full
speed
towards
them
;
upon
which
,
they
have
flap
their
hat
over
their
eye
,
so
as
that
they
may
not
be
know
,
in
case
they
should
be
see
,
and
conceal
themselves
behind
a
hedge
,
from
whence
they
could
perceive
in
the
carriage
,
as
it
pass
,
a
young
man
plainly
dress
,
with
a
lady
in
a
mask
,
of
the
exact
size
,
shape
,
and
air
of
Emilia
;
and
that
Pipes
follow
them
at
a
distance
,
while
he
ride
back
to
communicate
this
piece
of
intelligence
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
would
scarce
allow
him
time
to
conclude
his
information
;
he
run
down
to
the
stable
,
where
his
horse
be
keep
ready
saddle
for
the
purpose
,
and
never
doubt
that
the
lady
in
question
be
his
mistress
,
attend
by
one
of
her
uncle
's
clerk
,
mount
immediately
,
and
ride
full
gallop
after
the
chaise
,
which
(
when
he
have
proceed
about
two
mile
)
<EOS>
he
understand
from
Pipes
,
have
put
up
at
a
neighbouring
inn
.
    
<EOS>
though
his
inclination
prompt
him
to
enter
her
apartment
without
farther
delay
,
he
suffer
himself
to
be
dissuade
from
take
such
a
precipitate
step
,
by
his
privy
counsellor
,
who
observe
,
that
it
would
be
impracticable
to
execute
his
purpose
of
convey
her
against
her
will
from
a
public
inn
,
that
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
populous
village
,
which
would
infallibly
rise
in
her
defence
;
and
advise
him
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
chaise
,
in
some
remote
and
private
part
of
the
road
,
where
they
may
accomplish
their
aim
without
difficulty
or
danger
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
admonition
,
our
adventurer
order
Pipes
to
reconnoitre
the
inn
,
that
she
may
not
escape
another
way
,
while
he
and
the
valet
,
in
order
to
avoid
be
see
,
take
a
circuit
by
an
unfrequented
path
,
and
place
themselves
in
ambush
,
on
a
spot
which
they
choose
for
the
scene
of
their
atchievement
.
<EOS>
here
they
tarry
a
full
hour
,
without
see
the
carriage
,
or
hear
from
their
centinel
;
so
that
the
youth
,
unable
to
exert
his
patience
one
moment
longer
,
leave
the
foreigner
in
his
station
,
and
ride
back
to
his
faithful
lacquey
,
who
assure
him
,
that
the
traveller
have
not
yet
hove
up
their
anchor
,
or
proceed
on
their
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
intimation
,
Pickle
begin
to
entertain
such
alarming
suspicion
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
advance
to
the
gate
,
and
inquire
for
the
company
which
have
lately
arrive
in
a
chaise
and
six
.
<EOS>
the
inn
-
keeper
,
who
be
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
behaviour
of
those
passenger
,
do
not
think
proper
to
observe
the
instruction
he
have
receive
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
plainly
tell
him
,
that
the
chaise
do
not
halt
,
but
only
enter
at
one
door
,
and
go
out
at
the
other
,
with
a
view
to
deceive
those
who
pursue
it
,
as
he
guess
from
the
word
of
the
gentleman
,
who
have
earnestly
desire
,
that
his
route
may
be
conceal
from
any
person
who
should
inquire
about
their
motion
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
peart

measter
,
(
continue
this

<EOS>
I
believe
as
how
they
be
no
well
than
they
should
be
,
else
they
would
not
be
in
such
a
deadly
fear
of
be
overtake

<EOS>
Methinks
,
(
say
I
)
when
I
see
them
in
such
a
woundy
pother
to
be
go
,
oddsheartikin

<EOS>
this
must
be
some
Lundon
prentice
run
away
with
his
measter
's
daughter
,
as
sure
as
I
be
a
live
soul
.
<EOS>
but
,
be
he
who
will

sartain
it

a

nothing

for

,
"
Dog

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
howsomever
,
that
do
not
argufy
in
reverence
of
his
being
in
a
hurry
;
and
a
man
may
be
sometimes
a
little
too
judgmatical
in
his
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
"
in
all
probability
,
this
loquacious
landlord
would
have
serve
the
traveller
effectually
,
have
Peregrine
hear
him
to
an
end
;
but
this
impetuous
youth
,
far
from
listen
to
the
sequel
of
his
observation
,
interrupt
him
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
by
ask
eagerly
,
which
road
they
follow
;
and
have
receive
the
inn
-
keeper
's
direction
,
clapp'd
spur
to
his
horse
,
command
pipe
to
make
the
valet
acquaint
with
his
course
,
that
they
may
attend
him
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
.
    
<EOS>
by
the
publican
's
account
of
their
conduct
,
his
former
opinion
be
fully
confirm
;
he
ply
his
steed
to
the
height
of
his
mettle
,
and
so
much
be
his
imagination
ingrosse
by
the
prospect
of
have
Emilia
in
his
power
,
that
he
do
not
perceive
the
road
on
which
he
travel
,
be
quite
different
from
that
which
lead
to
the
habitation
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
.
<EOS>
the
valet
de
chambre
be
an
utter
stranger
to
that
part
of
the
country
;
and
as
for
Mr
Pipes
,
such
consideration
be
altogether
foreign
to
the
oeconomy
of
his
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
ten
long
mile
have
our
hero
rode
,
when
his
eye
be
bless
with
the
sight
of
the
chaise
ascend
an
hill
,
at
the
distance
of
a
good
league
;
upon
which
,
he
double
his
diligence
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
gain
upon
the
carriage
every
minute
,
and
at
length
approach
so
near
to
it
that
he
could
discern
the
lady
and
her
conductor
,
with
their
head
thrust
out
at
the
window
,
look
back
,
and
speak
to
the
driver
alternately
,
as
if
they
earnestly
beseech
him
to
augment
the
speed
of
his
cattle
.
    
<EOS>
be
thus
,
as
it
be
,
in
sight
of
port
,
while
he
cross
the
road
,
his
horse
happen
to
plunge
into
a
cart
-
rut
,
with
such
violence
,
that
he
be
throw
several
yard
over
his
head
;
and
the
beast
's
shoulder
be
slipt
by
the
fall
,
he
find
himself
disabled
from
pluck
the
fruit
,
which
be
almost
within
his
reach
;
for
he
have
leave
his
servant
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
him
;
and
although
they
have
be
at
his
back
,
and
supply
him
with
another
horse
,
they
be
so
indifferently
mount
,
that
he
could
not
reasonably
expect
to
overtake
the
flyer
,
who
profit
so
much
by
this
disaster
,
that
the
chaise
vanish
in
a
moment
.
    
<EOS>
It
may
be
easily
conceive
,
how
a
young
man
of
his
disposition
pass
his
time
,
in
this
tantalizing
situation
.
<EOS>
He
ejaculate
with
great
fervency
,
but
his
prayer
be
not
the
effect
of
resignation
.
<EOS>
He
run
back
on
foot
with

into
another
road
,
and
,
accord
to
his
judgment
,
be
by
that
time
about
three
mile
ahead
;
though
,
in
all
probability
,
the
horse
would
not
be
able
to
hold
out
much
longer
,
because
they
seem
to

quite
spend
when

pass
his
door

<EOS>
encourage
by
this
intimation
,
Peregrine
push
on
with
great
alacrity
;
though
he
could
not
regain
sight
of
the
desire

,
till
the
cloud
of

begin
to
deepen

and
even
then

nothing
more
than
a
transient
glimpse
;
for

than
shroud

from

<EOS>
these
vexatious
circumstance
animate
his
endeavour
,
while
they
irritate
his
chagrin
;
and
in
short
,
he
continue
his
pursuit
till
the
night
be
far
advanced
,
and
himself
so
uncertain
about
the
object
of
his
care
,
that
he
enter
a
solitary
inn
,
with
a
view
of
obtain
some
intelligence
,
and
to
his
infinite
joy
,
perceive
the
chaise
stand
by
itself
,
and
the
horse
pant
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
in
full
confidence
of
his
have
arrive
at
last
at
the
goal
of
all
his
wish
,
he
alight
instantaneously
,
and
run
up
to
the
coachman
,
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
,
command
him
,
in
an
imperious
tone
,
to
conduct
him
to
the
lady
's
chamber
,
on
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
the
driver
,
affright
at
this
menacing
address
,
protest
with
great
humility
,
that
he
do
not
know
whither
his
fare
have
retire
;
for
that
he
himself
be
pay
and
dismiss
from
this
service
,
because
he
would
not
undertake
to
drive
them
all
night
cross
the
country
,
without
stop
to
refresh
his
horse
:
but
he
promise
to
go
in
quest
of
the
waiter
,
who
would
shew
him
to
their
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
detach
on
that
errand
,
while
our
hero
stand
centinel
at
the
gate
,
till
the
arrival
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
join
him
by
accident
,
before
the
coachman
return
,
relieve
him
in
his
watch
;
and
then
the
young
gentleman
,
exasperate
at
his
messenger
's
delay
,
rush
with
fury
in
his
eye
from
room
to
room
,
denounce
vengeance
upon
the
whole
family
;
but
he
do
not
meet
with
one
live
soul
,
until
he
enter
the
garret
,
where
he
find
the
landlord
and
his
wife
in
bed
.
<EOS>
this
chicken
-
hearte
couple
,
by
the
light
of
a
rush
-
candle
that
burn
on
the
hearth
,
see
a
stranger
burst
into
the
chamber
,
in
such
a
terrible
attitude
,
be
seize
with
consternation
;
and
exalt
their
voice
,
in
a
most
lamentable
strain
,
begg'd
for
the
passion
of
Christ
,
that
he
would
spare
their
life
,
and
take
all
they
have
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
guess
from
this
exclamation
,
and
the
circumstance
of
their
be
abe
,
that
they
mistake
him
for
a
robber
,
and
be
ignorant
of
that
which
he
want
to
know
,
dispel
their
terror
,
by
make
them
acquaint
with
the
cause
of
his
visit
,
and
desire
the
husband
to
get
up
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
in
order
to
assist
and
attend
him
in
his
search
.
    
<EOS>
thus
reinforce
,
he
rummage
every
corner
of
the
inn
,
and
at
last
find
the
ostler
in
the
stable
,
be
by
him
inform
,
(
to
his
unspeakable
mortification
)
that
the
gentleman
and
lady
who
arrive
in
the
chaise
,
have
immediately
hire
post
-
horse
for
a
certain
village
at
the
distance
of
fifteen
mile
,
and
depart
without
halt
for
the
least
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
mad
with
his
disappointment
,
mount
his
horse
in
an
instant
,
and
,
with
his
attendant
,
take
the
same
road
,
with
full
determination
to
die
,
rather
than
desist
from
the
prosecution
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
,
by
this
time
,
rodeupward
of
thirty
mile
since
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
so
that
the
horse
be
almost
quite
jade
,
and
travel
this
stage
so
slowly
,
that
it
be
morning
before
they
reach
the
place
of
their
destination
,
where
,
far
from
find
the
fugitive
,
he
understand
,
that
no
such
person
as
he
describe
have
pass
that
way
,
and
that
,
in
all
likelihood
,
they
have
take
a
quite
contrary
direction
,
while
,
in
order
to
mislead
him
in
his
pursuit
,
they
have
amuse
the
hostler
with
a
false
route
.
<EOS>
this
conjecture
be
strengthne
,
by
his
perceiving
(
now
for
the
first
time
)
that
he
have
deviate
a
considerable
way
from
the
road
,
through
which
they
must
have
journey
,
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
place
of
her
mother
's
residence
;
and
these
suggestion
utterly
deprive
him
of
the
small
remain
of
recollection
,
which
he
have
hitherto
retain
.
<EOS>
His
eye
roll
about
,
witness
rage
and
distraction
;
he
foam
at
the
mouth
,
stamp
upon
the
ground
with
great
violence
,
uttered
incoherent
imprecation
against
himself
and
all
mankind
,
and
would
have
sally
forth
again
he
know
not
whither
,
upon
the
same
horse
,
which
he
have
already
almost
kill
with
fatigue
,
have
not
his
confident
find
mean
to
quiet
the
tumult
of
his
thought
,
and
recal
his
reflection
,
by
represent
the
condition
of
the
poor
animal
,
and
advise
him
to
hire
fresh
horse
,
and
ride
post
across
the
country
,
to
the
village
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
's
habitation
,
where
they
should
infallibly
intercept
the
daughter
,
provide
they
could
get
the
start
of
her
upon
the
road
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
not
only
relish
,
but
forthwith
act
in
conformity
with
this
good
counsel
.
    
<EOS>
His
own
horse
be
commit
to
the
charge
of
the
landlord
,
with
direction
for
pipe
,
in
case
he
should
come
thither
in
quest
of
his
master
;
and
a
couple
of
stout
gelding
be
prepare
<EOS>
,
he
and
his
valet
take
the
road
again
,
steer
their
course
accord
to
the
motion
of
the
post
-
boy
,
who
undertake
to
be
their
guide
.
<EOS>
They
have
almost
finish
the
first
stage
,
when
they
descry
a
post
-
chaise
just
halt
at
the
inn
where
they
propose
to
change
horse
;
upon
which
,
our
adventurer
,
glow
with
a
most
interesting
presage
,
put
his
beast
to
the
full
speed
,
and
approach
near
enough
to
distinguish
,
(
as
the
traveller
quit
the
carriage
)
<EOS>
that
he
have
at
last
come
up
with
the
very
individual
person
whom
he
have
pursue
so
long
.
    
<EOS>
flush
with
the
discovery
,
he
gallop
into
the
yard
so
suddenly
,
that
the
lady
and
her
conductor
scarce
have
time
to
shut
themselves
up
in
a
chamber
,
to
which
they
retreat
with
great
precipitation
;
so
that
the
pursuer
be
now
certain
of
have
house
his
prey
.
<EOS>
that
he
may
,
however
,
leave
nothing
to
fortune
,
he
place
himself
upon
the
stair
,
by
which
they
have
ascend
to
the
apartment
,
and
send
up
his
compliment
to
the
young
lady
,
desire
the
favour
of
be
admit
to
her
presence
,
otherwise
he
should
be
oblige
to
wave
all
ceremony
,
and
take
that
liberty
which
she
would
not
give
.
<EOS>
the
servant
have
convey
this
message
through
the
keyhole
,
return
with
an
answer
,
import
,
that
she
would
adhere
to
the
resolution
she
have
take
,
and
perish
rather
than
comply
with
his
will
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
without
stay
to
make
any
rejoinder
to
this
reply
,
run
up
stair
,
and
thunder
at
the
door
for
entrance
,
be
give
to
understand
by
the
nymph
's
attendant
,
that
a
blunderbuss
be
ready
prime
for
his
reception
,
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
spare
him
the
necessity
of
shed
blood
,
in
defence
of
a
person
who
have
put
herself
under
his
protection
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
law
of
the
land
(
say
he
)
can
not
now
untie
the
knot
by
which
we
be
bind
together
;
and
therefore
I
will
guard
her
as
my
own
property
;
so
that
you
have
better
desist
from
your
fruitless
attempt
,
and
thereby
consult
your
own
safety
:
for
,
by
the
God
that
make
me
!
<EOS>
I
will
discharge
my
piece
upon
you
,
as
soon
as
you
set
your
nose
within
the
door
;
and
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
.
"
<EOS>
these
menace
from
a
citizen
's
clerk
,
would
have
be
sufficient
motive
for
Pickle
to
storm
the
breach
,
although
they
have
not

by
that
declaration
,
which
inform
him
of
Emilia
's
have
bestow
herself
in
marriage
upon
such
a
contemptible
rival

<EOS>
this
sole
consideration
add
wing
to
his
impetuosity
,
and
he
apply
his
foot
to
the
door
with
such
irresistible
force
,
as
burst
it
open
in
an
instant
,
enter
at
the
same
time
with
a
pistol
ready

His

his
blunderbuss

when
he
see
him
approach
,
start
back
,
with
evident
sign
of
surprize
and
consternation

exclaim
,
"

Sir

you

<EOS>
and
,
without

some
mistake
with

before

time
to

this
salutation
,
the
lady
hear
it
,
advanced
to
him
,
and
pull
off
a
mask

discover
a
face
which

more
instantaneous

petrifying
effect

that
which
this
countenance

astonished
youth

His

LXXXV
Peregrine

who
reject
his
proposal

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
at

however
,
his
constitution
overcome
his
disease
,
though
not
before
it
have
in
a
great
measure
tame
the
fury
of
his
disposition
,
and
bring
him
to
a
serious
consideration
of
his
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
humiliation
of
his
spirit
,
he
reflect
with
shame
and
remorse
upon
his
treachery
to
the
fair
,
the
innocent
Emilia
;
he
remember
his
former
sentiment
in
her
favour
,
as
well
as
the
injunction
of
his
die
uncle
;
he
recollect
his
intimacy
with
her
brother
,
against
which
he
have
so
basely
sin
;
and
revolve
all
the
circumstance
of
her
conduct
,
find
it
so
commendable
,
spirit
,
and
noble
,
that
he
deem
her
an
object
of
sufficient
dignity
to
merit
his
honourable
address
,
even
though
his
duty
have
not
be
concern
in
the
decision
:
but
,
obligate
as
he
be
,
to
make
reparation
to
a
worthy
family
,
which
he
have
so
grosly
injure
,
he
think
he
could
not
manifest
his
reformation
too
soon
;
and
,
whenever
he
find
himself
able
to
hold
the
pen
,
write
a
letter
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
wherein
he
acknowledge
,
with
many
expression
of
sorrow
and
contrition
,
that
he
have
act
a
part
altogether
unbecome
a
man
of
honour
,
and
should
never
enjoy
the
least
tranquillity
of
mind
,
until
he
should
have
merit
her
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
He
protest
,
that
although
his
happiness
intirely
depend
upon
the
determination
of
Emilia
,
he
would
even
renounce
all
hope
of
be
bless
with
her
favour
,
if
she
could
point
out
any
other
method
of
make
reparation
to
that
amiable
young
lady
,
but
by
lay
his
heart
and
fortune
at
her
foot
,
and
submit
himself
to
her
pleasure
during
the
remain
part
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
conjure
her
,
therefore
,
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
,
to
pardon
him
,
in
consideration
of
his
sincere
repentance
,
and
use
her
maternal
influence
with
her
daughter
,
so
as
that
he
may
be
permit
to
wait
upon
her
with
a
wedding
-
ring
,
as
soon
as
his
health
would
allow
him
to
undertake
the
journey

that

contrive
a
scheme
to

with
a
view
of

<EOS>
"
SIR
,
I
receive
the
favour
of
yours
,
and
be
glad
,
for
your
own
sake
,
that
you
have
attain
a
due
sense
and
conviction
of
your
unkind
and
unchristian
behaviour
to
poor
Emy
.
<EOS>
I
thank
God
,
none
of
my
child
be
ever
so
insult
before
.
    
<EOS>
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
my
daughter
be
no
upstart
,
without
friend
or
education
,
but
a
young
lady
as
well
breed
,
and
better
bear
,
than
most
private
gentlewoman
in
the
kingdom
:
and
therefore
,
though
you
have
no
esteem
for
her
person
,
you
ought
to
have
pay
some
regard
to
her
family
,
which
(
no
disparagement
to
you
,
Sir
)
be
more
honourable
than
your
own
.
<EOS>
as
for
your
proposal
,
Miss
Gauntlet
will
not
hear
of
it
,
be
,
that
she
think
her
honour
will
not
allow
her
to
listen
to
any
term
of
reconciliation
;
and
she
be
not
yet
so
destitute
,
as
to
embrace
an
offer
to
which
she
have
the
least
objection
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
she
be
so
much
indisposed
,
that
she
can
not
possibly
see
company
;
so
I
beg
you
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
make
a
fruitless
journey
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
perhaps
your
future
conduct
may
deserve
her
forgiveness
;
and
really
,
as
I
be
concerned
for
your
happiness
,
which
(
you
assure
me
)
depend
upon
her
condescension
,
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
may
;
and
be
(
notwithstanding
all
that
have
happen
)
 
Your
sincere
well
-
wisher
,
Cecilia
Gauntlet

from

in

(
he

<EOS>
the

have
consult
her

vanity
rather
than

<EOS>
these

of
resentment
help
him
to
bear
his

LXXXVI
<EOS>
He
return
to
London
,
and
meet
with
Cadwallader
,
who
entertain
him
with
a
curious
dialogue
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
have
perform
these
last
office
,
in
honour
of
his
deceased
benefactor
,
and
present
Mr
Jolter
to
the
long
-
expect
living
,
which
at
this
time
happen
to
be
vacant
,
return
to
London
,
and
resume
his
former
gaiety
:
not
that
he
be
able
to
shake
Emilia
from
his
thought
,
or
even
to
remember
her
without
violent
emotion
;
for
,
as
he
recover
his
vigour
,
his
former
impatience
recur
,
and
therefore
he
resolve
to
plunge
himself
headlong
into
some
intrigue
,
that
may
engage
his
passion
,
and
amuse
his
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
a
man
of
his
accomplishment
could
not
fail
to
meet
with
a
variety
of
subject
,
on
which
his
gallantry
would
have
be
properly
exercise
;
and
this
abundance
distract
his
choice
,
which
at
any
time
be
apt
to
be
influence
by
caprice
and
whim
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
,
that
he
have
lift
his
view
,
through
a
matrimonial
perspective
,
as
high
as
a
lady
of
the
first
quality
and
distinction
;
and
now
,
that
he
be
refuse
by
Miss
Gauntlet
,
and
enjoy
a
little
respite
from
the
agony
of
that
flame
which
her
charm
have
kindle
in
his
heart
,
he
renew
his
assiduity
to
her
grace
;
and
,
though
he
durst
not
yet
risk
an
explanation
,
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
see
himself
so
well
receive
in
quality
of
a
particular
acquaintance
,
that
he
flatter
himself
with
the
belief
of
his
have
make
some
progress
in
her
heart
;
and
be
confirm
in
this
conceited
notion
,
by
the
assurance
of
her
woman
,
whom
,
by
liberal
largesse
,
he
retain
in
his
interest
,
because
she
find
mean
to
persuade
him
,
that
she
be
in
the
confidence
of
her
lady
.
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
this
encouragement
,
and
the
sanguine
suggestion
of
his
own
vanity
,
he
dread
the
thought
of
expose
himself
to
her
ridicule
and
resentment
,
by
a
premature
declaration
,
and
determine
to
postpone
his
address
,
until
he
should
be
more
certify
of
the
probability
of
succeed
in
his
attempt
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
remain
in
this
hesitation
and
suspence
,
he
be
one
morning
very
agreeably
surprize
with
the
appearance
of
his
friend
Crabtree
,
who
,
by
the
permission
of
Pipes
,
to
whom
he
be
well
know
,
enter
his
chamber
before
he
be
awake
,
and
,
by
a
violent
shake
of
the
shoulder
,
disengage
him
from
the
arm
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
first
compliment
have
mutually
pass
,
Cadwallader
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
arrive
in
town
over
-
night
in
the
stage
-
coach
from
Bath
,
and
entertain
him
with
such
a
ludicrous
account
of
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
that
Peregrine
,
for
the
first
time
since
their
parting
,
indulge
himself
in
mirth
,
even
to
the
hazard
of
suffocation
.
    
<EOS>
this
relation
be
confine
to
a
curious
dialogue
that
pass
betwixt
a
woollen
-
draper
and
his
wife
,
who
be
his
only
companion
during
the
good
part
of
the
journey
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
labour
under
a
diabetes
,
in
consequence
of
have
use
the
water
injudiciously
for
another
complaint
;
and
,
that
she
may
not
be
an
impediment
to
the
carriage
,
by
order
it
to
halt
,
as
often
as
she
should
have
occasion
to
disembogue
,
she
have
provide
herself
with
a
leathern
convenience
,
which
her
husband
carry
in
the
pocket
of
his
great
coat
,
convey
it
privately
to
her
,
when
she
find
herself
necessitate
to
use
it
;
and
afterwards
,
take
the
opportunity
to
empty
it
out
at
the
window
,
when
the
misanthrope
's
head
chance
to
be
turn
another
way

couple
embark
with
Crabtree

in
the
full
persuasion

utterly
bereft
of
the
sense
of
hearing
,
they
keep
no
sort
of
reserve
in
their
conversation

and
at
last
fairly
quarrel
,
on
account
of
the
good
man

want
of

commodity

pressing

thus

from

herself
from

construe
his

sound
the
duchess
,
and
undeceive
Pickle
,
who
,
by
an
extraordinary
accident
,
become
acquaint
with
another
lady
of
quality
.
   
<EOS>
Crabtree
<EOS>
have
rehearse
this
adventure
,
in
such
a
peculiarity
of
manner
,
as
add
infinite
ridicule
to
every
circumstance
,
and
repeat
every
scandalous
report
which
have
circulate
at
the
Bath
,
after
Peregrine
's
departure
,
be
inform
by
the
youth
,
that
he
harbour
a
design
upon
the
person
of
such
a
duchess
,
and
in
all
appearance
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
his
reception
;
but
,
that
he
would
not
venture
to
declare
himself
,
until
he
should
be
more
ascertained
of
her
sentiment
:
and
therefore
,
he
begg'd
leave
to
depend
upon
the
intelligence
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
who
,
he
know
,
be
admit
to
her
party
.
    
<EOS>
the
Misanthrope
,
before
he
would
promise
his
assistance
,
ask
if
his
prospect
verge
towards
matrimony
?
<EOS>
and
our
adventurer
(
who
guess
the
meaning
of
his
question
)
reply
in
the
negative
,
he
undertake
the
office
of
reconnoitre
her
inclination
,
protest
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
would
never
concern
himself
in
any
scheme
<EOS>
,
that
do
not
tend
to
the
disgrace
and
deception
of
all
the
sex
.
    
<EOS>
on
these
condition
,
he
espouse
the
interest
of
our
hero
,
and
a
plan
be
immediately
concert
,
in
consequence
of
which
they
meet
by
accident
at
her
grace
's
table
;
and
Pickle
have
stay
all
the
fore
-
part
of
the
evening
,
and
sit
out
all
the
company
,
except
the
misanthrope
and
a
certain
widow
-
lady
,
who
be
say
to
be
in
the
secret
of
my
lady
duchess
,
go
away
,
on
pretence
of
an
indispensible
engagement
,
that
Crabtree
may
have
a
proper
opportunity
of
make
him
the
subject
of
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
have
scarce
quit
the
apartment
,
when
this
Cynic
attend
him
to
the
door
,
with
a
look
of
morose
disdain
,
"
be
I
an
absolute
prince
,
(
say
he
)
and
that
fellow
one
of
my
subject
,
I
would
order
him
to
be
<EOS>
cloath'd
in
sack
-
cloth
,
and
he
should
drive
my
ass
to
water
,
that
his
lofty
spirit
may
be
lower
to
the
level
of
his
desert
.
<EOS>
the
pride
of
a
peacock
be
downright
self
-
denial
,
when
compare
with
the
vanity
of
that
coxcomb
,
which
be
naturally
arrogant
,
but
be
now
render
altogether
intolerable
,
by
the
reputation
he
acquire
at
Bath
,
or
kick
a
bully
,
outwit
a
club
of
raw
harper
,
and
diver
other
prank
,
in
the
execution
of
which
he
be
more
lucky
than
wise
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
have
contribute
so
much
to
the
increase
of
his
insolence
and
self
-
conceit
,
as
the
favour
he
find
among
the
lady
.
<EOS>
ay
,
the
lady
,
Madam
,
I
care
not
who
know
it
:
the
lady
,
who
(
to
their
honour
be
it
speak
)
never
fail
to
patronize
foppery
and
folly
,
provide
they
solicit
their
encouragement
.
    
<EOS>
and
yet
,
this
dog
be
not
on
the
footing
of
those
hermaphroditical
animal
,
who
may
be
reckon
among
the
number
of
waiting
-
woman
,
who
air
your
shift
,
comb
your
lap
-
dog
,
examine
your
nose
with
magnify
glass
,
in
order
to
squeeze
out
the
worm
,
clean
your
tooth
-
brush
,
sweeten
your
handkerchiefs
,
and
soften
waste
paper
for
your
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
fellow
Pickle
be
entertain
for
more
important
purpose
;
his
turn
of
duty
never
come
till
all
those
lapwing
be
go
to
roost
;
then
he
scale
window
,
leap
over
garden
-
wall
,
and
be
let
in
by
Mrs
Betty
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
magistrate
of
Bath
compliment
him
with
the
freedom
of
the
corporation
,
merely
because
,
through
his
mean
,
the
water
have
gain
extraordinary
credit
;
for
every
female
of
a
tolerable
appearance
,
that
go
thither
on
account
of
her
sterility
,
get
the
well
of
her
complaint
,
during
his
residence
at
the
Bath
:
and
now
,
the
fellow
think
no
woman
can
withstand
his
address
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
here
three
minute
,
when
I
could
perceive
with
half
an
eye
,
that
he
have
mark
out
your
grace
for
a
conquest
;
I
mean
in
an
honourable
way
;
though
the
rascal
have
impudence
enough
to
attempt
any
thing
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
fix
his
eye
upon
the
duchess
,
who
(
while
her
face
glow
with
indignation
)
turn
to
her
confidant
,
express
herself
in
these
word
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
actually
some
truth
in
what
this
old
ruffian
say
;
I
have
myself
observe
that
young
fellow
eye
me
with
a
very
particular
stare
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
to
be
at
all
wonder
at
,
(
say
her
friend
)
that
a
youth
of
his
complexion
should
be
sensible
to
the
charm
of
your
grace
;
but
I
dare
say
,
he
would
not
presume
to
entertain
any
,
but
the
most
honourable
and
respectful
sentiment
.
"
<EOS>
"
respectful
sentiment
!
<EOS>
(
cry
my
lady
,
with
a
look
of
ineffable
disdain
)
if
I
think
the
fellow
have
assurance
enough
to
think
of
me
in
any
shape
,
I
protest
I
would
forbid
him
my
house
.
    
<EOS>
upon
my
honour
,
such
instance
of
audacity
should
induce
person
of
quality
to
keep
your
small
gentry
at
a
great
distance
;
for
they
be
very
apt
to
grow
impudent
,
upon
the
least
countenance
or
encouragement
.
"
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
change
the
subject
of
discourse
,
and
next
day
communicate
his
discovery
to
his
friend
Pickle
,
who
,
upon
this
occasion
,
feel
the
most
stinging
sensation
of
mortify
pride
,
and
resolve
to
quit
his
prospect
with
a
good
grace
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
execution
of
this
self
-
deny
scheme
cost
him
one
moment
's
uneasiness
;
for
his
heart
have
never
be
interested
in
the
pursuit
,
and
his
vanity
triumph
in
the
thought
of
manifest
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
very
next
time
he
visit
her
grace
,
his
behaviour
be
remarkably
frank
,
sprightly
,
and
disengaged
;
and
the
subject
of
love
be
artfully
introduce
by
the
widow
,
who
have
be
direct
to
sound
his
inclination
,
he
rally
the
passion
with
great
ease
and
severity
,
and
make
no
scruple
of
declare
himself
heartwhole
.
    
<EOS>
though
the
duchess
have
resent
his
suppose
affection
,
she
be
now
offend
at
his
insensibility
,
and
even
signify
her
disgust
,
by
observe
,
that
perhaps
his
attention
to
his
own
qualification
screen
him
from
the
impression
of
all
other
object
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
enjoy
this
sarcasm
,
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
plainly
discern
,
the
company
be
join
by
a
certain
virtuoso
,
who
have
gain
free
access
to
all
the
great
family
of
the
land
,
by
his
notable
talent
of
gossiping
and
buffoonery
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
now
in
the
seventy
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
;
his
birth
be
so
obscure
,
that
he
scarce
know
his
father
's
name
,
his
education
suitable
to
the
dignity
of
his
descent
,
his
character
publickly
brand
with
homicide
,
profligacy
,
and
breach
of
trust
;
yet
this
man
,
by
the
happy
inheritance
of
impregnable
effrontery
,
and
a
lucky
prostitution
of
all
principle
,
in
render
himself
subservient
to
the
appetite
of
the
great
,
have
attain
to
an
independency
of
fortune
,
as
well
as
to
such
a
particular
share
of
favour
among
the
quality
,
that
although
he
be
well
known
to
have
pimp
for
three
generation
of
the
nobility
,
there
be
not
a
lady
of
fashion
in
the
kingdom
,
who
scruple
to
admit
him
to
her
toilette
,
or
even
to
be
squire
by
him
,
in
any
public
place
of
entertainment
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
this
sage
be
occasionally
useful
to
his
fellow
-
creature
,
by
these
connexion
with
people
of
fortune
;
for
,
he
often
undertake
to
solicite
charity
in
behalf
of
distressed
object
,
with
a
view
of
embezzle
one
half
of
the
benefaction
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
errand
of
this
kind
that
now
bring
him
to
the
house
of
her
grace
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
sit
a
few
minute
,
he
tell
the
company
,
that
he
would
favour
them
with
a
very
proper
opportunity
to
extend
their
benevolence
,
for
the
relief
of
a
poor
gentlewoman
,
who
be
reduce
to
the
most
abject
misery
,
by
the
death
of
her
husband
,
and
just
deliver
of
a
couple
of
fine
boy
.
    
<EOS>
They
,
moreover
,
understand
from
his
information
,
that
this
object
be
daughter
of
a
good
family
,
who
have
renounce
her
,
in
consequence
of
her
marry
an
ensign
without
a
fortune
;
and
even
obstruct
his
promotion
with
all
their
influence
and
power
;
a
circumstance
of
barbarity
,
which
have
make
such
an
impression
upon
his
mind
,
as
disorder
his
brain
,
and
drive
him
to
despair
,
in
a
fit
of
which
he
have
make
away
with
himself
,
leave
his
wife
then
big
with
child
,
to
all
the
horror
of
indigence
and
grief
.
    
<EOS>
Various
be
the
criticism
on
this
pathetic
picture
,
which
the
old
man
draw
with
great
expression
.
<EOS>
My
lady
duchess
conclude
,
that
she
must
be
a
creature
void
of
all
feeling
and
reflection
,
who
could
survive
such
aggravate
misery
;
therefore
,
do
not
deserve
to
be
relieve
,
except
in
the
character
of
a
common
beggar
;
and
be
generous
enough
to
offer
a
recommendation
,
by
which
she
would
be
admit
into
an
infirmary
,
to
which
her
grace
be
a
subscriber
;
at
the
same
time
,
advise
the
sollicitor
to
send
the
twin
to
the
Foundling
-
hospital
,
where
they
would
be
carefully
nurse
and
bring
up
,
so
as
to
become
useful
member
of
the
commonwealth
.
<EOS>
another
lady
,
with
all
due
deference
to
the
opinion
of
the
duchess
,
be
free
enough
to
blame
the
generosity
of
her
grace
,
which
would
only
serve
to
encourage
child
in
their
disobedience
to
their
parent
,
and
may
be
the
mean
not
only
of
prolong
the
distress
of
the
wretched
creature
,
but
also
of
ruin
the
constitution
of
some
young
heir
,
perhaps
the
hope
of
a
great
family
;
for
,
she
do
suppose
that
madam
,
when
her
month
should
be
up
,
and
her
brat
dispose
of
,
would
spread
her
attraction
to
the
public
,
(
provide
she
could
profit
by
her
person
)
and
,
in
the
usual
way
,
make
a
regular
progress
from
St
James
's
to
Drury
-
lane
.
<EOS>
She
apprehend
,
for
these
reason
,
that
their
compassion
would
be
most
effectually
shew
,
in
leave
her
to
perish
in
her
present
necessity
;
and
that
the
old
gentleman
would
be
unpardonable
,
should
he
persist
in
his
endeavour
to
relieve
her
.
    
<EOS>
a
third
member
of
this
tender
-
hearted
society
,
after
have
ask
if
the
young
woman
be
handsome
?
and
be
answer
in
the
negative
,
allow
,
that
there
be
a
great
deal
of
reason
in
what
have
be
say
by
the
honourable
person
who
have
speak
last
nevertheless
,
she
humbly
conceive
,
her
sentence
would
admit
of
some
mitigation
.
"
<EOS>
let
the
bantling
(
say
she
)
be
send
to
the
hospital
,
accord
to
the
advice
of
her
grace
,
and
a
small
collection
be
make
for
the
present
support
of
the
mother
;
and
when
her
health
be
recover
,
I
will
take
her
into
my
family
,
in
quality
of
an
upper
-
servant
,
or
medium
between
me
and
my
woman
;
for
,
upon
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
to
chide
,
or
give
direction
to
a
creature
,
who
be
in
point
of
birth
and
education
,
but
one
degree
above
the
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
this
proposal
meet
with
universal
approbation
.
<EOS>
the
duchess
(
to
her
immortal
honour
)
begin
the
contribution
with
a
crown
;
so
that
the
rest
of
the
company
be
oblige
to
restrict
their
liberality
to
half
the
sum
,
that
her
grace
may
not
be
affront
;
and
the
proposer
demand
the
poor
woman
's
name
and
place
of
abode
,
the
old
mediator
could
not
help
give
her
ladyship
verbal
direction
,
though
he
be
extremely
mortified
(
on
more
account
than
one
)
to
find
such
an
issue
to
his
solicitation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
,
though
humorous
as
winter
have
a
tear
for
pity
,
and
an
hand
open
as
day
for
melt
charity
,
be
shock
at
the
nature
and
result
of
this
ungenerous
consultation
.
<EOS>
He
contribute
his
half
-
crown
,
however
;
and
retire
from
the
company
,
betook
himself
to
the
lodging
of
the
forlorn
lady
in
the
straw
,
accord
to
the
direction
he
have
hear
.
    
<EOS>
upon
inquiry
,
he
understand
,
that
she
be
then
visit
by
some
charitable
gentlewoman
,
who
have
send
for
a
nurse
,
and
wait
the
return
of
the
messenger
;
and
he
send
up
his
respect
,
desire
he
may
be
permit
to
see
her
,
on
pretence
of
have
be
intimate
with
her
late
husband
.
    
<EOS>
though
the
poor
woman
have
never
hear
of
his
name
,
she
do
not
think
proper
to
deny
his
request
;
and
he
be
conduct
to
a
paultry
chamber
in
the
third
story
,
where
he
find
this
unhappy
widow
sit
up
in
a
truckle
-
bed
,
and
suckle
one
of
her
infant
,
with
the
most
piteous
expression
of
anguish
in
her
feature
,
which
be
naturally
regular
and
sweet
,
while
the
other
be
fondle
on
the
knee
of
a
person
,
whose
attention
be
so
much
ingrosse
by
her
little
charge
,
that
for
the
present
she
could
mind
nothing
else
:
and
it
be
not
till
after
the
first
compliment
pass
betwixt
<EOS>
the
hapless
mother
and
our
adventurer
,
that
he
perceive
the
stranger
's
countenance
,
which
inspire
him
with
the
high
esteem
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
He
behold
all
the
grace
of
elegance
and
beauty
,
breathing
sentiment
and
beneficence
,
and
soften
into
the
most
inchanting
tenderness
of
weep
sympathy
:
and
when
he
declare
the
cause
of
his
visit
,
which
be
no
other
than
the
desire
of
befriend
the
distressed
lady
,
to
whom
he
present
a
bank

note
for
twenty
pound

he
be

with
such
a
look

<EOS>
nor
be
this
prepossession
diminish
by
the
information
of
the
widow
,
who
,
after
have
manifest
her
gratitude
in
a
flood
of
tear
,
tell
him
,
that
the
unknown
object
of
his
esteem
be
a
person
of
honour
,
who
have
hear
by
accident
of
her
deplorable
situation
,
have
immediately
obey
the
dictate
of
her
humanity
,
and
come
in
person
to
relieve
her
distress
;
that
she
have
not
only
generously
supply
her
with
money
for
present
sustenance
,
but
also
undertake
to
provide
a
nurse
for
her
babe
,
and
even
promise
to
favour
her
with
protection
<EOS>
,
should
she
survive
her
present
melancholy
situation
.
<EOS>
to
these
article
of
intelligence
she
add
,
that
the
name
of
her
benefactress
be
the
celebrated
lady
 
,
to
whose
character
the
youth
be
no
stranger
,
though
he
have
never
see
her
person
before
.
<EOS>
the
kill
edge
of
her
charm
be
a
little
blunt
by
the
accident
of
time
and
fortune
;
but
no
man
of
taste
and
imagination
,
whose
nerve
be
not
quite
chill
with
the
frost
of
age
,
could
,
even
at
that
time
look
upon
her
with
impunity
:
<EOS>
and
as
Peregrine
see
her
attraction
heighten
by
the
tender
office
in
which
she
be
engage
,
he
be
smite
with
her
beauty

and
so
ravish
with
her
compassion
,
that
he
could
not
suppress
his
emotion
,
but
applaud
her
benevolence
with
all
the
warmth
of
enthusiasm
.
    
<EOS>
Her

chapter
LXXXVIII
<EOS>
the
memoir
of
a
lady
of
quality
.
   
<EOS>
by
the
circumstance
of
the
story
which
I
be
go
to
relate
,
you
will
be
convince
of
my
candour
,
while
you
be
inform
of
my
indiscretion
;
and
be
enable
,
I
hope
,
to
perceive
,
that
howsoever
<EOS>
my
head
may
have
err
,
my
heart
hath
always
be
uncorrupted
,
and
that
I
have
be
unhappy
,
because
I
love
,
and
be
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
I
need
not
observe
,
that
I
be
the
only
child
of
a
man
of
good
fortune
,
who
indulge
me
,
in
my
infancy
,
with
all
the
tenderness
of
paternal
affection
;
and
when
I
be
six
year
old
,
send
me
to
a
private
school
,
where
I
stay
till
my
age
be
double
,
and
become
such
a
favourite
,
that
I
be
(
even
in
those
early
day
)
<EOS>
carry
to
all
the
place
of
public
diversion
,
the
court
itself
not
except
;
an
indulgence
that
flatter
my
love
of
pleasure
,
to
which
I
be
naturally
addict
,
and
encourage
those
idea
of
vanity
and
ambition
,
which
spring
up
so
early
in
the
human
mind
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
lively
and
good
-
natured
,
my
imagination
apt
to
run
riot
,
my
heart
liberal
and
disintereste
;
though
I
be
so
obstinately
attach
to
my
own
opinion
,
that
I
could
not
well
brook
contradiction
;
and
in
the
whole
of
my
disposition
,
resemble
that
of
Henry
the
fifth
,
as
describe
by
Shakespear
.
    
<EOS>
in
my
thirteenth
year
I
go
to
Bath
,
where
I
be
first
introduce
into
the
world
as
a
woman
,
have
be
intitle
to
that
privilege
by
my
person
,
which
be
remarkably
tall
for
my
year
;
and
there
my
fancy
be
quite
captivate
by
the
variety
of
diversion
in
which
I
be
continually
engage
:
not
that
the
party
be
altogether
new
to
me
,
but
because
I
now
find
myself
consider
as
a
person
of
consequence
,
and
surround
by
a
croud
of
admirer
,
who
court
my
acquaintance
,
and
feed
my
vanity
with
praise
and
adulation
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
whether
or
not
I
deserve
their
encomium
,
I
leave
the
world
to
judge
;
but
my
person
be
commend
,
and
my
talent
in
dancing
meet
with
universal
applause
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
every
thing
appear
joyous
to
a
young
creature
,
who
be
so
void
of
experience
and
dissimulation
,
that
she
believe
every
body
's
heart
as
sincere
as
her
own
,
and
every
object
such
as
it
appear
to
be
.
    
<EOS>
among
the
swain
who
sigh
,
or
pretend
to
sigh
for
me
,
be
two
that
bear
a
pretty
equal
share
of
my
favour
;
(
it
be
too
superficial
to
deserve
the
name
of
love
.
)
<EOS>
one
of
these
be
a
forward
youth
of
sixteen
,
extremely
handsome
,
lively
,
and
impudent
,
who
attend
in
quality
of
page
upon
the
princess
Amelia
,
who
spend
that
season
at
the
Bath
;
the
other
be
a
Scotch
nobleman
turn
of
thirty
,
who
be
grace
with
a
red
ribbon
,
and
dance
particularly
well
,
two
qualification
of
great
weight
with
a
girl
of
my
age
,
whose
heart
be
not
deeply
interested
in
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
page
prevail
over
this
formidable
rival
;
though
our
amour
go
no
farther
than
a
little
flirting
,
and
cease
intirely
when
I
leave
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
next
year
,
however
,
I
revisit
this
agreeable
scene
,
and
pass
my
time
in
the
same
circle
of
amusement
;
in
which
,
indeed
,
each
season
at
Bath
be
exactly
resemble
by
that
which
succeed
,
allow
for
the
difference
of
company
,
which
be
continually
vary
.
<EOS>
there
I
meet
with
the
same
incense
,
and
again
have
my
favourite
,
who
be
a
North
Briton
,
and
captain
of
foot
,
near
forty
year
of
age
,
and
a
little
lame
,
an
impediment
which
I
do
not
discover
,
until
it
be
point
out
by
some
of
my
companion
,
who
rally
me
upon
my
choice
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
chearful
,
and
very
amorous
,
have
a
good
countenance
and
an
excellent
understanding
,
possess
a
great
deal
of
art
,
and
would
have
persuade
me
to
marry
him
,
have
I
not
be
restrain
by
the
authority
of
my
father
,
whose
consent
be
not
to
be
obtain
in
favour
of
a
man
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
many
proposal
of
marriage
be
make
to
my
parent
;
but
,
as
they
come
from
people
whom
I
do
not
like
,
I
reject
them
all
,
be
determine
to
refuse
every
man
who
do
not
make
his
address
to
myself
in
person
,
because
I
have
no
notion
of
marry
for
any
thing
but
love
.
    
<EOS>
among
these
formal
proposer
be
a
Scottish
earl
,
whose
pretension
be
break
off
by
some
difference
about
settlement
;
and
the
son
of
an
english
baron
,
with
whom
my
father
be
in
treaty
,
when
he
carry
me
to
town
,
on
a
visit
to
a
young
lady
,
with
whom
I
have
be
intimate
from
my
infancy
.
    
<EOS>
She
be
just
deliver
of
her
first
son
,
for
whom
we
stand
sponsor
;
so
that
this
occasion
detain
us
a
whole
month
,
<EOS>
during
which
,
I
go
to
a
ball
at
court
on
the
queen
's
birth
-
day
,
and
there
,
for
the
first
time
,
feel
what
love
and
beauty
be
.
    
<EOS>
the
second
son
of
duke
 
,
who
have
just
return
from
his
travel
,
be
dance
with
the
princess
royal
,
when
a
young
lady
come
and
desire
me
to
go
and
see
a
stranger
,
whom
all
the
world
admire
:
upon
which
,
I
follow
her
into
the
circle
,
and
observe
this
object
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
coat
of
white
cloth
,
face
with
blue
sattin
embroider
with
silver
,
of
the
same
piece
with
his
waistcoat
;
his
fine
hair
hang
down
his
back
in
ringlet
below
his
waist
,
and
his
hat
be
lace
with
silver
,
and
garnish
with
a
white
feather
;
but
his
person
beggar
all
description
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
and
graceful
,
neither
corpulent
nor
meagre
,
his
limb
finely
proportion
,
his
countenance
open
and
majestic
,
his
eye
full
of
sweetness
and
vivacity
,
his
tooth
regular
,
and
his
pouting
lip
of
the
complexion
of
the
damask
rise
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
be
form
for
love
,
and
inspire
it
wherever
he
appear
;
nor
be
he
a
niggard
of
his
talent
,
but
liberally
return
it
;
at
least
what
pass
for
such
:
for
he
have
a
flow
of
gallantry
,
for
which
many
lady
of
this
land
can
vouch
from
their
own
experience
:
but
he
exclaim
against
marriage
,
because
he
have
,
as
yet
,
meet
with
no
woman
,
to
whose
charm
he
would
surrender
his
liberty
,
though
a
princess
of
France
,
and
a
lady
of
the
same
rank
in
 
,
be
say
to
be
,
at
that
time
,
enamour
of
his
person
.
    
<EOS>
I
go
home
,
totally
ingrosse
by
his
idea
,
flatter
myself
,
that
he
have
observe
me
with
some
attention
;
for
I
be
young
and
new
,
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
attract
the
notice
and
approbation
of
the
queen
herself
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
,
be
at
the
opera
,
I
be
agreeably
surprised
with
the
appearance
of
this
amiable
stranger
,
who
no
sooner
see
me
enter
,
than
he
approach
so
near
to
the
place
where
I
sit
,
that
I
overhear
what
he
say
to
his
companion
;
and
be
so
happy
as
to
find
myself
the
subject
of
his
discourse
,
which
abound
with
rapturous
expression
of
love
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
listen
to
these
transport
without
emotion
;
my
colour
change
,
my
heart
throb
with
unusual
violence
,
and
mine
eye
betray
my
inclination
in
sundry
favourable
glance
,
which
he
seem
to
interpret
aright
,
though
he
could
not
then
avail
himself
of
his
success
,
so
far
as
to
communicate
his
sentiment
by
speech
,
because
we
be
stranger
to
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
I
pass
that
night
in
the
most
anxious
suspence
,
and
several
day
elapse
,
before
I
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
be
at
court
on
a
ballnight
,
and
determine
against
dancing
,
I
perceive
him
among
the
croud
,
and
,
to
my
unspeakable
joy
,
see
him
advance
with
my
lord
P
#
#
#
#
,
who
introduce
him
to
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
soon
find
mean
to
alter
my
resolution
;
and
I
condescend
to
be
his
partner
all
the
evening
;
during
which
,
he
declare
his
passion
in
the
most
tender
and
persuasive
term
that
real
love
could
dictate
,
or
fruitful
imagination
invent
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
his
protestation
,
because
I
wish
them
true
,
and
be
an
unexperienced
girl
of
fifteen
.
    
<EOS>
I
comply
with
his
earnest
request
of
be
permit
to
visit
me
,
and
even
invite
him
to
breakfast
next
morning
;
so
that
you
may
imagine
<EOS>
(
I
speak
to
those
that
feel
)
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
that
night
,
enjoy
much
repose
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
hurry
and
flutter
of
my
spirit
,
that
I
rise
at
six
to
receive
him
at
ten
.
<EOS>
I
dress
myself
in
a
new
pink
sattin
-
gown
and
my
best
laced
night
-
cloath
,
and
be
so
animate
by
the
occasion
,
that
if
ever
I
deserve
a
compliment
upon
my
look
,
it
be
my
due
at
this
meeting
.
    
<EOS>
the
wish
-
for
moment
come
,
that
bring
my
lover
to
my
view
<EOS>
:
I
be
overwhelmed
with
joy
,
modesty
,
and
fear
of
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
We
sit
down
to
breakfast
,
but
do
not
eat
.
<EOS>
He
renew
his
address
with
irresistible
eloquence
,
and
press
me
to
accept
of
his
hand
,
without
farth
hesitation
:
<EOS>
but
,
to
such
a
precipitate
step
,
I
object
,
as
a
measure
repugnant
to
decency
,
as
well
as
to
that
duty
which
I
owe
to
my
father
,
whom
I
tenderly
love
.
    
<EOS>
though
I
withstand
this
premature
proposal
,
I
do
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
situation
of
my
thought
;
and
thus
commence
a
tender
correspondence
,
which
be
maintain
by
letter
while
I
remain
in
the
country
,
and
carry
on
(
when
I
be
in
town
)
by
private
interview
,
twice
or
thrice
a
week
,
at
the
house
of
my
milliner
,
where
such
endearment
pass
as
refined
and
happy
lover
know
,
and
other
can
only
guess
.
<EOS>
truth
and
innocence
prevail
on
my
side
,
while
his
heart
be
fraught
with
sincerity
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
such
frequent
intercourse
create
an
intimacy
which
I
begin
to
think
dangerous
,
and
therefore
yield
to
his
repeat
desire
,
that
we
may
be
unite
for
ever
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
resolve
to
avoid
him
,
until
the
day
should
be
fix
,
and
very
innocently
(
though
not
very
wisely
)
tell
him
my
reason
for
this
determination
,
which
be
no
other
than
a
consciousness
of
my
incapacity
to
refuse
him
any
thing
he
should
demand
as
a
testimony
of
my
love
.
    
<EOS>
the
time
be
accordingly
appoint
,
at
the
distance
of
a
few
day
,
during
which
I
intend
to
have
implore
my
father
's
consent
,
though
I
have
but
<EOS>
faint
hope
of
obtain
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
he
be
by
some
mean
or
other
apprize
of
our
design
,
before
I
could
prevail
upon
myself
to
make
him
acquaint
with
our
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
dance
with
my
lover
at
the
Ridotto
on
the
precede
evening
,
and
there
,
perhaps
,
our
eye
betray
us
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
several
of
lord
W####m
's
relation
,
who
disapprove
of
the
match
,
come
up
and
rally
him
on
his
passion
;
<EOS>
lord
s####k
in
particular
,
use
this
remarkable
expression
,
"
Nephew
,
as
much
love
as
you
please
,
but
no
matrimony
.
"
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
priest
be
prepare
,
and
the
bridegroom
wait
for
me
at
the
appoint
place
,
in
all
the
transport
of
impatient
expectation
,
I
be
,
without
any
previous
warning
,
carry
into
the
country
by
my
father
,
who
take
no
notice
of
the
intelligence
he
have
receive
,
but
decoy
me
into
the
coach
,
on
pretence
of
take
the
air
;
and
when
we
have
proceed
as
far
as
Turnham
green
,
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
would
dine
in
that
place
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
no
remedy
:
I
be
oblige
to
bear
my
disappointment
,
though
with
an
ache
heart
,
and
follow
him
up
stair
into
an
apartment
,
where
he
tell
me
he
be
minutely
inform
of
my
matrimonial
scheme
.
    
<EOS>
I
do
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
truth
,
but
assure
him
,
while
the
tear
gush
from
my
eye
,
that
my
want
of
courage
alone
have
hinder
me
from
make
him
privy
to
my
passion
;
though
I
own
,
I
should
have
marry
lord
w####m
,
even
though
he
have
disapprove
of
my
choice
.
<EOS>
I
remind
him
of
the
uneasy
life
I
lead
at
home
,
and
frankly
acknowledge
,
that
I
love
my
admirer
too
well
to
live
without
him
;
though
if
he
wou'd
favour
me
with
his
consent
,
I
would
defer
my
intention
,
and
punctually
observe
any
day
he
should
fix
for
our
nuptial
.
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
beg
he
would
permit
me
to
send
a
message
to
lord
W####m
,
who
be
wait
in
expectation
of
my
coming
,
and
may
(
without
such
notice
)
imagine
I
be
play
the
jilt
.
<EOS>
He
grant
this
last
request
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
I
send
a
letter
to
my
lover
,
who
,
when
he
receive
it
,
have
almost
faint
away
,
believe
that
I
should
be
lock
up
in
the
country
,
and
snatch
for
ever
from
his
arm
.
<EOS>
torture
with
these
apprehension
,
he
change
cloath
immediately
,
and
take
horse
,
resolve
to
follow
me
whithersoever
<EOS>
we
should
go
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
we
proceed
as
far
as
Brentford
,
where
we
lay
,
intend
to
be
at
my
father
's
country
-
house
next
night
;
and
my
admirer
put
up
at
the
same
inn
,
practise
every
expedient
his
invention
could
suggest
,
to
procure
an
interview
;
but
all
his
endeavour
be
unsuccessful
,
because
I
,
who
little
dream'd
of
his
be
so
near
,
have
go
to
bed
upon
our
first
arrival
,
overwhelm
with
affliction
and
tear
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
throw
myself
at
my
father
's
foot
,
and
conjure
him
by
all
the
tie
of
paternal
affection
,
to
indulge
me
with
an
opportunity
of
see
my
admirer
once
more
,
before
I
should
be
convey
from
his
wish
.
    
<EOS>
the
melancholy
condition
in
which
I
prefer
this
supplication
,
melt
the
tender
heart
of
my
parent
,
who
yield
to
my
solicitation
,
and
carry
me
back
to
town
,
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
,
who
have
watch
our
motion
,
and
arrive
at
his
own
lodging
,
before
we
alight
at
my
father
's
house
,
obey
my
summon
on
the
instant
,
and
appear
before
me
like
an
angel
.
<EOS>
Our
faculty
be
,
for
some
minute
,
suspend
by
a
conflict
of
grief
and
joy
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
and
give
him
to
understand
,
that
I
be
come
to
town
,
in
order
to
take
my
leave
of
him
,
by
the
permission
of
my
father
,
whom
I
have
promise
to
attend
into
the
country
next
day
,
before
he
would
consent
to
my
return
;
the
chief
cause
and
pretence
of
which
,
be
my
earnest
desire
to
convince
him
,
that
I
be
not
to
blame
for
the
disappointment
he
have
suffer
,
and
that
I
should
see
him
again
in
a
month
,
when
the
nuptial
knot
should
be
tie
in
spite
of
all
opposition
.
    
<EOS>
My
lover
,
who
be
better
acquaint
with
the
world
,
have
well
nigh
run
distract
with
this
information
.
<EOS>
He
swear
he
would
not
leave
me
,
until
I
should
promise
to
meet
and
marry
him
next
day
;
or
,
if
I
refuse
to
grant
that
request
,
he
would
immediately
leave
the
kingdom
,
to
which
he
would
never
more
return
;
and
before
his
departure
,
sacrifice
lord
S
#
#
#
#
b
#
#
#
#
,
son
to
the
duke
of
S
A
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
the
only
person
upon
earth
who
could
have
betray
us
to
my
father
,
because
he
alone
be
trust
with
the
secret
of
our
intend
marriage
,
and
have
actually
undertake
to
give
me
away
;
an
office
which
he
afterwards
decline
.
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
also
affirm
,
that
my
father
decoy
me
into
the
country
,
with
a
view
of
coope
me
up
,
and
sequester
me
intirely
from
his
view
and
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
I
plead
my
father
's
well
-
know
tenderness
,
and
use
all
the
argument
I
could
recollect
to
divert
him
from
his
revenge
upon
lord
H
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
He
be
deaf
to
all
my
representation
,
and
nothing
,
I
find
,
would
prevail
upon
him
to
suppress
his
resentment
,
but
a
positive
promise
to
comply
with
his
former
desire
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
would
hazard
every
thing
to
make
him
happy
;
but
could
not
,
with
any
regard
to
my
duty
,
take
such
a
step
,
without
the
knowledge
of
my
parent
;
or
,
if
I
be
so
inclined
,
it
would
be
impracticable
to
elude
his
vigilance
and
suspicion
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
employ
such
pathetic
remonstrance
,
and
retain
such
a
powerful
advocate
within
my
own
breast
,
that
before
we
part
,
I
assure
him
,
my
whole
power
should
be
exert
for
his
satisfaction
;
and
he
signify
his
resolution
of
sit
up
all
night
,
in
expectation
of
see
me
at
his
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
retire
,
than
I
go
into
the
next
room
,
and
desire
my
father
to
fix
a
day
for
the
marriage
;
in
which
case
,
I
would
chearfully
wait
upon
him
into
the
country
;
whereas
,
should
he
deny
my
request
,
on
pretence
of
stay
for
the
consent
of
my
lover
's
relation
,
which
be
very
uncertain
,
I
would
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
marry
lord
W####m
,
cost
what
it
would
.
<EOS>
He
consent
to
the
match
,
but
would
not
appoint
a
day
for
the
ceremony
,
which
he
propose
to
defer
until
all
party
should
be
agree
;
and
such
a
favourable
crisis
,
I
fear
,
would
never
happen
.
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
within
myself
to
gratify
my
lover
's
expectation
,
by
elope
,
if
possible
,
that
very
night
;
though
the
execution
of
this
plan
be
extremely
difficult
,
because
my
father
be
upon
the
alarm
,
and
my
own
maid
,
who
be
my
bedfellow
,
altogether
in
his
interest
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
consideration
,
I
find
mean
to
engage
one
of
the
house
-
maid
in
my
behalf
,
who
bespeak
an
hackney
-
coach
,
to
be
keep
in
wait
all
night
;
and
to
bed
I
go
with
my
Abigail
,
whom
(
as
I
have
not
close
an
eye
)
<EOS>
I
wake
about
five
in
the
morning
,
and
send
to
pack
up
some
thing
for
our
intended
journey
.
    
<EOS>
while
she
be
thus
employ
,
I
get
up
,
and
huddle
on
my
cloath
,
stand
upon
my
pillow
,
lest
my
father
,
who
lie
in
the
chamber
below
,
should
hear
me
afoot
,
and
suspect
my
design
.
    
<EOS>
have
dress
myself
with
great
dispatch
and
disorder
,
I
flounce
down
stair
,
stalk
as
heavily
as
I
could
tread
,
that
he
may
mistake
me
for
one
of
the
servant
;
and
my
confederate
open
the
door
,
I
sally
out
into
the
street
,
though
I
know
not
which
way
to
turn
,
and
,
to
my
unspeakable
mortification
,
neither
coach
nor
chair
appear
.
    
<EOS>
have
travel
on
foot
a
good
way
,
in
hope
of
find
a
convenience
;
and
be
not
only
disappointed
in
that
particular
,
but
also
bewilder
in
my
peregrination
,
I
begin
to
be
exceedingly
alarm
with
the
apprehension
of
be
meet
by
some
person
who
may
know
me
;
because
,
in
that
case
,
my
design
would
undoubtedly
have
be
discover
,
from
every
circumstance
of
my
appearance
at
that
time
of
day
;
for
I
have
put
on
the
very
cloath
which
I
have
pull
off
over
night
,
so
that
my
dress
be
altogether
odd
and
peculiar
:
my
shoe
be
very
fine
,
and
over
a
large
hoop
<EOS>
I
wear
a
pink
sattin
quilt
petticoat
trim
with
silver
,
which
be
partly
cover
by
a
white
dimity
night
-
gown
,
a
full
quarter
of
a
yard
too
short
:
my
handkerchief
and
apron
be
hurry
on
without
pin
;
my
night
-
cap
could
not
contain
my
hair
,
which
hang
about
my
ear
in
great
disorder
,
and
my
countenance
denote
a
mixture
of
hope
and
fear
,
joy
and
shame
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
I
make
my
address
to
that
honourable
member
of
society
a
shoe
-
black
,
whom
I
earnestly
intreate
to
provide
me
with
a
coach
or
chair
,
promise
to
reward
him
liberally
for
his
trouble
:
but
he
have
the
misfortune
to
be
lame
,
be
unable
to
keep
up
with
my
pace
;
so
that
,
by
his
advice
and
direction
,
I
go
into
the
first
public
-
house
I
find
open
,
where
I
stay
some
time
,
in
the
utmost
consternation
,
among
a
crew
of
wretch
whom
I
think
proper
to
bribe
for
their
civility
,
not
without
the
terror
of
be
strip
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
my
messenger
return
with
a
chair
,
of
which
I
take
immediate
possession
;
and
fear
that
,
by
this
time
,
my
family
would
be
alarm
,
and
send
directly
to
lord
W####m
's
lodging
,
I
order
myself
to
be
carry
thither
backwards
,
that
so
I
may
pass
undiscovered
.
    
<EOS>
this
stratagem
succeed
accord
to
my
wish
;
I
run
up
stair
,
in
a
state
of
trepidation
,
to
my
faithful
lover
,
who
call
an
hackneycoach
,
in
which
we
go
to
church
and
be
married
.
    
<EOS>
His
fear
be
then
all
over
,
but
mine
recur
with
double
aggravation
:
    
<EOS>
I
dread
the
sight
of
my
father
,
and
share
all
the
sorrow
he
suffer
on
account
of
my
undutiful
behaviour
:
for
I
love
him
with
such
piety
of
affection
,
that
I
would
have
endure
every
other
specie
of
distress
,
rather
than
have
give
him
the
least
uneasiness
:
but
love
(
where
he
reign
in
full
empire
)
be
altogether
irresistible
,
surmount
every
difficulty
,
and
swallow
up
all
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
with
me
;
and
now
the
irrevocable
step
be
take
,
my
first
care
be
to
avoid
his
sight
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
beg
that
lord
W####m
would
think
of
some
remote
place
in
the
country
,
to
which
we
may
retire
for
the
present
;
and
he
forthwith
conduct
me
to
an
house
on
Blackheath
,
where
we
be
very
civilly
receive
by
a
laughter
-
love
dame
,
who
seem
to
mistake
me
for
one
of
her
own
sisterhood
.
    
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
perceive
her
opinion
,
than
I
desire
lord
W####m
to
undeceive
her
;
upon
which
she
be
make
acquainted
with
the
predicament
in
which
I
stand
,
and
shew
us
into
a
private
room
,
where
I
call
for
pen
and
paper
,
and
write
an
apology
to
my
father
,
for
have
act
contrary
to
his
will
,
in
so
important
a
concern
.
    
<EOS>
this
task
be
perform
,
the
bridegroom
give
me
to
understand
,
that
there
be
a
necessity
for
our
be
bed
immediately
,
in
order
to
render
the
marriage
binding
,
lest
my
father
should
discover
and
part
us
before
consummation
.
<EOS>
I
plead
hard
for
a
respite
till
the
evening
,
object
to
the
indecency
of
go
to
bed
before
noon
;
but
he
find
mean
to
invalidate
all
my
argument
,
and
to
convince
me
,
that
it
be
now
my
duty
to
obey
.
    
<EOS>
Rather
than
hazard
the
imputation
of
be
obstinate
and
refractory
on
the
first
day
of
my
probation
,
I
suffer
myself
to
be
lead
into
a
chamber
,
which
be
darken
by
my
express
stipulation
,
that
my
shame
and
confusion
may
be
the
better
conceal
,
and
yield
to
the
privilege
of
a
dear
husband
,
who
love
me
to
adoration
.
    
<EOS>
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
we
be
call
to
dinner
,
which
we
have
order
to
be
ready
at
four
;
but
such
a
paultry
care
have
be
forget
,
amidst
the
transport
of
our
mutual
bliss
.
<EOS>
We
get
up
,
however
,
and
when
we
come
down
stair
,
I
be
ashamed
to
see
the
light
of
day
,
or
meet
the
eye
of
my
beloved
lord
.
<EOS>
I
eat
little
,
say
less
,
be
happy
,
though
overwhelm
with
confusion
,
undergo
a
thousand
agitation
,
some
of
which
be
painful
,
but
by
far
the
great
part
belong
to
rapture
and
delight
;
we
be
imparadise
in
the
gratification
of
our
mutual
wish
,
and
feel
all
that
love
can
bestow
,
and
sensibility
enjoy
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
twilight
,
we
return
to
lord
W####m
's
lodging
in
town
,
where
I
receive
a
letter
from
my
father
,
import
,
that
he
would
never
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
circumstance
in
his
manner
of
writing
,
from
which
I
conceive
an
happy
presage
of
his
future
indulgence
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
with
his
usual
appellation
of
Dear
Fanny
,
which
,
though
it
be
expunge
to
make
way
for
the
word
Madam
,
encourage
me
to
hope
that
his
paternal
fondness
be
not
yet
extinguish
.
    
<EOS>
at
supper
,
we
be
visit
by
lord
W####m
's
young
sister
,
who
laugh
at
us
for
our
inconsiderate
match
,
though
,
she
own
,
she
envy
our
happiness
,
and
offer
me
the
use
of
her
cloath
,
until
I
could
retrieve
my
own
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
of
a
great
deal
of
humour
,
plain
but
genteel
,
civil
,
friendly
,
and
perfectly
well
-
breed
.
<EOS>
She
favour
us
with
her
company
till
the
night
be
pretty
far
advanced
,
and
do
not
take
her
leave
till
we
retire
to
our
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
as
our
lodging
be
not
spacious
or
magnificent
,
we
resolve
to
see
little
company
;
but
this
resolution
be
frustrate
by
the
numerous
acquaintance
of
lord
W####m
,
who
let
in
half
the
town
;
so
that
I
run
the
gauntlet
for
a
whole
week
among
a
set
of
wit
,
who
always
delight
in
teaze
a
young
creature
of
any
note
,
when
she
happen
to
make
such
a
steal
match
.
<EOS>
among
those
that
visit
us
upon
this
occasion
,
be
my
lord
's
young
brother
,
who
be
at
that
time
in
keep
with
a
rich
heiress
of
masculine
memory
,
and
take
that
opportunity
of
make
a
parade
with
his
equipage
,
which
be
indeed
very
magnificent
,
but
altogether
disregard
by
us
,
whose
happiness
consist
in
the
opulence
of
mutual
love
.
    
<EOS>
this
ceremony
of
receive
visit
be
perform
,
we
go
to
wait
on
his
mother
the
duchess
of
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
hear
I
be
an
heiress
,
readily
forgave
her
son
for
marry
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
,
and
favour
us
with
a
very
cordial
reception
;
insomuch
that
,
for
several
month
,
we
dine
almost
constantly
at
her
table
;
and
I
must
own
,
I
always
find
her
unaltered
in
her
civility
and
affection
,
contrary
to
her
general
character
,
which
be
haughty
and
capricious
.
<EOS>
She
be
undoubtedly
a
woman
of
great
spirit
and
understanding
,
but
subject
to
an
infirmity
which
very
much
impair
and
disguise
every
other
qualification
.
    
<EOS>
in
about
three
week
after
our
marriage
,
I
be
so
happy
as
to
obtain
the
forgiveness
of
my
father
,
to
whose
house
we
repair
,
in
order
to
pay
our
respect
and
submission
.
    
<EOS>
at
sight
of
me
he
weep
;
nor
do
I
behold
his
tear
unmove
:
<EOS>
my
heart
be
over
-
charge
with
tenderness
and
sorrow
,
for
have
offend
such
an
indulgent
parent
;
so
that
I
mingle
my
tear
with
his
,
while
my
dear
husband
,
whose
soul
be
of
the
soft
and
gentle
mould
,
melt
with
sympathy
at
the
affect
scene
.
    
<EOS>
be
thus
reconcile
to
my
father
,
we
attend
him
into
the
country
,
where
we
be
receive
by
my
mother
,
who
be
a
sensible
good
woman
,
though
not
susceptible
of
love
,
and
therefore
less
apt
to
excuse
a
weakness
,
to
which
she
be
an
utter
stranger
.
<EOS>
this
be
likewise
the
case
with
an
uncle
,
from
whom
I
have
great
expectation
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
plain
good
-
natured
man
,
and
treat
us
with
great
courtesy
;
though
his
notion
,
in
point
of
love
,
be
not
exactly
conformable
to
ours
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
be
,
and
seem
to
be
so
happy
in
my
choice
,
that
my
family
not
only
become
satisfied
with
the
match
,
but
exceedingly
fond
of
lord
w####m
.
    
<EOS>
after
a
short
stay
with
them
in
the
country
,
we
return
to
London
,
in
order
to
be
introduce
at
court
,
and
then
set
out
for
the
North
,
on
a
visit
to
my
brother
-
in
-
law
the
duke
of
h
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
,
by
a
letter
to
lord
W####m
,
invite
us
to
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
My
father
accordingly
equip
us
with
horse
and
money
;
for
our
own
finance
be
extremely
slender
,
consist
only
of
a
small
pension
allow
by
his
grace
,
upon
whom
the
brother
be
intirely
dependent
,
the
father
have
die
suddenly
,
before
suitable
provision
could
be
make
for
his
young
child
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
take
my
leave
of
my
relation
,
bid
adieu
to
my
paternal
home
,
and
find
myself
launch
into
a
world
of
care
and
trouble
,
though
the
voyage
on
which
I
have
embark
be
altogether
voluntary
,
and
my
companion
the
person
on
whom
I
doate
to
distraction
,
I
could
not
help
feel
some
melancholy
sensation
,
which
,
however
,
in
a
little
time
,
give
way
to
a
train
of
more
agreeable
idea
.
<EOS>
I
be
visit
in
town
by
almost
all
the
woman
of
fashion
,
many
of
whom
,
I
perceive
,
envy
me
the
possession
of
a
man
who
have
make
strange
havock
among
their
heart
,
and
some
of
them
know
the
value
of
his
favour
.
<EOS>
one
in
particular
endeavour
to
cultivate
my
friendship
with
singular
mark
of
regard
;
but
I
think
proper
to
discourage
her
advance
,
by
keep
within
the
bound
of
bare
civility
;
and
indeed
,
to
none
of
them
be
I
lavish
of
my
complaisance
;
for
I
dedicate
my
whole
time
to
the
object
of
my
affection
,
who
engross
my
wish
to
such
a
degree
,
<EOS>
that
although
I
be
never
jealous
(
because
I
have
no
reason
to
be
so
)
I
envy
the
happiness
of
every
woman
whom
he
chance
at
any
time
to
hand
into
a
coach
.
    
<EOS>
the
duchess
of

who
be
newly
married
to
the
earl
of

,
a
particular
friend
of
lord
W####m
's
,
carry
me
to
court
,
and
present
me
to
the
queen
,
who
express
her
approbation
of
my
person
in
very
particular
term
,
and
observe
the
satisfaction
that
appear
in
my
countenance
with
mark
of
admiration
;
desire
her
lady
to
take
notice
,
how
little
happiness
depend
upon
wealth
,
since
there
be
more
joy
in
my
face
than
in
all
her
court
beside
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
declaration
could
not
fail
to
overwhelm
me
with
blush
,
which
her
majesty
seem
to
behold
with
pleasure
;
for
she
frequently
repeat
the
remark
,
and
shew
me
to
all
the
foreigner
of
distinction
,
with
many
gracious
expression
of
favour
.
    
<EOS>
She
wish
lord
w####m
happiness
instead
of
joy
,
and
be
pleased
to
promise
,
that
she
would
provide
for
her
pretty
beggar
:
and
poor
enough
we
certainly
be
in
every
article
but
love
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
we
feel
no
necessity
,
but
pass
the
summer
in
a
variety
of
pleasure
and
party
,
the
great
part
of
which
be
plan
by
lord
W####m
's
sister
and
another
lady
,
who
be
at
that
time
mistress
to
the
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
a
wit
,
but
homely
in
her
person
;
the
other
,
a
woman
of
great
beauty
and
masculine
understanding
;
and
a
particular
friendship
subsist
between
them
,
though
they
be
both
lover
of
power
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
this
lady
,
who
sit
at
the
helm
,
be
extremely
elegant
as
well
as
expensive
in
her
diversion
,
in
many
of
which
we
bear
a
share
;
particularly
in
her
party
upon
the
water
,
which
be
contrive
in
all
the
magnificence
of
taste
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
these
amusement
,
a
trifle
circumstance
occur
,
which
I
shall
relate
as
an
instance
of
that
jealous
sensibility
which
characterise
lord
W
#
#
#
#
's
disposition
.
<EOS>
a
large
company
of
lady
and
gentleman
have
agree
to
dine
at
Vauxhall
,
and
sup
at
Marblehall
,
where
we
propose
to
conclude
the
evening
with
a
dance
,
one
barge
be
insufficient
to
contain
the
whole
company
,
we
be
divide
by
lot
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
my
husband
and
I
be
part
.
<EOS>
this
separation
be
equally
mortifying
to
us
both
,
who
,
though
married
,
be
still
lover
;
and
my
chagrin
be
increase
,
when
I
perceive
that
I
be
doom
to
sit
by
Sir
W
#
#
#
#
Y
#
#
#
#
,
a
man
of
professed
gallantry
:
for
,
<EOS>
although
lord
W####m
have
,
before
his
marriage
,
make
his
address
to
every
woman
he
see
,
I
know
very
well
he
do
not
desire
that
any
person
should
make
love
to
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
therefore
give
umbrage
,
by
talk
to
this
gallant
<EOS>
,
I
converse
with
a
Scotch
nobleman
,
who
,
accord
to
common
report
,
have
formerly
sigh
among
my
admirer
:
by
these
mean
,
in
seek
to
avoid
one
error
,
I
unwittingly
plunge
myself
into
a
great
;
and
disoblige
Lord
W####m
so
much
,
that
he
could
not
conceal
his
displeasure
;
nay
,
so
deeply
be
he
offend
at
my
conduct
,
that
in
the
evening
,
when
the
ball
begin
,
he
would
scarce
deign
to
take
me
by
the
hand
in
the
course
of
dancing
,
and
dart
such
unkind
look
as
pierce
me
to
the
very
soul
;
and
what
augment
my
concern
,
be
my
ignorance
of
the
trespass
I
have
commit
.
<EOS>
I
be
torture
with
a
thousand
uneasy
reflection
;
I
begin
to
fear
that
I
have
mistake
his
temper
,
and
give
my
heart
to
a
man
who
be
tired
of
possession
;
tho
'
I
resolve
to
bear
without
complain
the
misfortune
I
have
entail
upon
myself
.
    
<EOS>
I
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
speak
to
him
,
and
thereby
discover
the
cause
of
his
chagrin
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
there
be
no
time
for
expostulation
,
the
misunderstanding
continue
on
his
side
,
with
such
evident
mark
of
uneasiness
,
that
every
individual
of
the
company
make
up
to
me
,
and
inquire
about
the
cause
of
his
disorder
;
so
that
I
be
fain
to
amuse
their
concern
,
by
say
that
he
have
be
ill
the
day
before
,
and
dancing
do
not
agree
with
his
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
so
much
be
he
incense
by
this
unhappy
circumstance
of
my
conduct
,
which
be
void
of
all
intention
to
offend
him
,
that
he
determine
to
be
revenge
of
me
,
for
my
indiscretion
,
and
at
supper
,
chance
to
sit
between
two
very
handsome
lady
,
(
one
of
whom
be
lately
dead
,
and
the
other
,
at
present
,
my
neighbour
in
the
country
)
<EOS>
he
affect
an
air
of
gaiety
,
and
openly
coquet
with
them
both
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
only
punishment
he
inflict
on
his
innocent
wife
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
entertainment
,
we
engage
in
some
simple
diversion
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
gentleman
be
order
to
salute
the
lady
;
when
Lord
w####m
,
in
perform
this
command
,
unkindly
neglect
me
in
my
turn
;
and
I
have
occasion
for
all
my
discretion
and
pride
,
to
conceal
from
the
company
the
agony
I
feel
at
this
mark
of
indifference
and
disrespect
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
obtain
the
victory
over
myself
,
and
pretend
to
laugh
at
his
husband
-
like
behaviour
,
while
the
tear
stand
in
my
eye
,
and
my
heart
swell
even
to
burst
.
    
<EOS>
We
break
up
about
five
,
after
have
spend
the
most
tedious
evening
I
have
ever
know
;
and
this
offend
lover
go
to
bed
in
a
state
of
sullen
silence
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
whatever
desire
I
have
to
come
to
an
explanation
<EOS>
,
I
think
myself
so
much
aggrieve
by
his
unreasonable
prejudice
,
that
I
could
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
demand
a
conference
,
till
after
his
first
nap
,
when
my
pride
give
way
to
my
tenderness
,
I
clasp
him
in
my
arm
,
though
he
pretend
to
discourage
these
advance
of
my
love
:
I
ask
how
he
could
be
so
unjust
as
to
take
umbrage
at
my
civility
to
a
man
whom
,
he
know
,
I
have
refuse
for
his
sake
.
    
<EOS>
I
chid
him
for
his
barbarous
endeavour
to
awake
my
jealousy
,
and
use
such
irresistible
argument
in
my
own
vindication
,
that
he
be
convince
of
my
innocence
,
seal
my
acquittal
with
a
kind
embrace
,
and
we
mutually
enjoy
the
soft
transport
of
a
fond
reconciliation
.
    
<EOS>
never
be
passion
more
eager
,
delicate
,
or
unreserved
,
than
that
which
glow
within
our
breast
.
<EOS>
far
from
be
cloy
with
the
possession
of
each
other
,
our
rapture
seem
to
increase
with
the
term
of
our
union
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
part
,
though
but
for
a
few
hour
,
by
the
necessary
avocation
of
life
,
we
be
unhappy
during
that
brief
separation
,
and
meet
again
,
like
lover
who
know
no
joy
but
in
one
another
's
presence
.
<EOS>
how
many
delicious
evening
do
we
spend
together
,
in
our
own
little
apartment
,
after
we
have
order
the
candle
to
be
take
away
,
that
we
may
enjoy
the
agreeable
reflection
of
the
moon
,
in
a
fine
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
such
a
mild
and
solemn
scene
naturally
dispose
the
mind
to
peace
and
benevolence
;
but
when
improve
with
the
conversation
of
the
man
one
love
,
it
fill
the
imagination
with
idea
of
ineffable
delight
!
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
safely
say
,
my
heart
be
so
wholly
ingrosse
by
my
husband
,
that
I
never
take
pleasure
in
any
diversion
,
where
he
be
not
personally
concerned
;
nor
be
I
ever
guilty
of
one
think
repugnant
to
my
duty
and
my
love
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
autumn
we
set
out
for
the
north
,
and
be
meet
on
the
road
by
the
duke
and
twenty
gentleman
,
who
conduct
us
to
h####n
,
where
we
live
in
all
imaginable
splendor
.
<EOS>
His
grace
,
at
that
time
,
maintain
above
an
hundred
servant
,
with
a
band
of
music
,
which
always
perform
at
dinner
,
keep
open
table
,
and
be
visit
by
a
great
deal
of
company
.
    
<EOS>
the
oeconomy
of
his
house
be
superintend
by
his
eld
sister
,
a
beautiful
young
lady
of
an
amiable
temper
,
with
whom
I
soon
contract
an
intimate
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
duke
use
to
rally
me
upon
my
fondness
for
lord
W####m
,
who
be
a
sort
of
an
humourist
,
and
apt
to
be
in
a
pet
,
in
which
case
he
would
leave
the
company
,
and
go
to
bed
by
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
I
always
disappear
,
give
up
every
consideration
to
that
of
please
my
husband
,
notwithstanding
the
ridicule
of
his
relation
,
who
tax
me
with
have
spoil
him
with
too
much
indulgence
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
express
too
much
tenderness
and
condescension
for
a
man
,
who
doate
upon
me
to
such
excess
,
that
when
business
oblige
him
to
leave
me
,
he
always
snatch
the
first
opportunity
to
return
,
and
often
ride
through
darkness
,
storm
and
tempest
to
my
arm
.
    
<EOS>
have
stay
about
seven
month
in
this
place
,
I
find
myself
in
a
fair
way
of
be
a
mother
;
and
that
I
may
be
near
my
own
relation
,
in
such
an
interesting
situation
,
I
and
my
dear
companion
depart
from
H####n
,
not
without
great
reluctance
;
for
I
be
fond
of
the
Scots
in
general
,
who
treat
me
with
great
hospitality
and
respect
;
and
to
this
day
,
they
pay
me
the
compliment
of
say
,
I
be
one
of
the
good
wife
in
that
country
,
which
be
so
justly
celebrate
for
good
woman
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
have
attend
me
to
my
father
's
house
,
be
oblige
to
return
to
Scotland
,
to
support
his
interest
in
be
elect
member
of
parliament
;
so
that
he
take
his
leave
of
me
,
with
a
full
resolution
of
see
me
again
,
before
the
time
of
my
lying
-
inn
;
and
all
the
comfort
I
enjoy
in
his
absence
,
be
the
perusal
of
his
letter
,
which
I
punctually
receive
,
together
with
those
of
his
sister
,
who
,
from
time
to
time
,
favour
me
with
assurance
of
his
constancy
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
indeed
these
testimonial
be
necessary
to
one
of
my
disposition
;
for
I
be
none
of
those
who
could
be
content
with
half
an
heart
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
spare
one
complacent
look
to
any
other
woman
,
but
expect
the
undivided
homage
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
disappointed
in
this
expectation
,
I
should
(
though
a
wife
)
have
rebel
or
die
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
my
parent
treat
me
with
great
tenderness
,
intend
that
lord
W####m
should
be
settle
in
a
house
of
his
own
,
and
accommodate
with
my
fortune
;
and
his
expectation
from
the
queen
be
very
sanguine
,
when
I
be
take
ill
,
and
deliver
of
a
dead
child
:
an
event
which
affect
me
so
much
,
that
when
I
understand
the
extent
of
my
misfortune
,
my
heart
throb
with
such
violence
,
that
my
breast
could
scarce
contain
it
;
and
my
anxiety
be
aggravate
by
the
absence
of
my
lord
,
produce
a
dangerous
fever
,
of
which
he
be
no
sooner
apprize
by
letter
,
than
he
come
post
from
Scotland
;
but
before
his
arrival
,
I
be
suppose
to
be
in
a
fair
way
.
    
<EOS>
during
this
journey
,
he
be
torture
with
all
that
terrible
suspence
which
prevail
in
the
mind
of
those
who
be
in
danger
of
lose
that
which
be
most
dear
to
them
;
and
when
he
enter
the
house
,
be
so
much
overwhelmed
with
apprehension
,
that
he
durst
not
inquire
about
the
state
of
my
health
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
my
part
,
I
never
close
an
eye
from
the
time
on
which
I
expect
his
return
;
and
when
I
hear
his
voice
,
throw
open
my
curtain
,
and
sit
up
in
the
bed
to
receive
him
,
though
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
He
run
towards
me
with
all
the
eagerness
of
passion
,
and
clasp'd
me
in
his
arm
;
he
kneel
by
my
bed
-
side
,
kiss
my
hand
a
thousand
time
,
and
weep
with
transport
of
tenderness
and
joy
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
meeting
be
so
pathetic
,
as
to
overcome
my
enfeeble
constitution
;
and
we
be
part
by
those
who
be
wise
than
ourselves
,
and
see
that
nothing
be
so
proper
for
us
as
a
little
repose
.
    
<EOS>
but
how
shall
I
relate
the
deplorable
transition
from
envy
happiness
to
excess
of
misery
,
which
I
now
sustain
!
<EOS>
My
month
be
hardly
up
,
when
my
dear
husband
be
take
ill
:
perhaps
the
fatigue
of
body
as
well
as
mind
,
which
he
have
undergo
on
my
account
,
occasion
a
fatal
ferment
in
his
blood
,
and
his
health
fall
a
sacrifice
to
his
love
.
<EOS>
Physicians
be
call
from
London
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
they
bring
no
hope
of
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
by
their
advice
,
he
be
remove
to
town
,
for
the
convenience
of
be
punctually
attend
.
<EOS>
every
moment
be
too
precious
to
be
throw
away
;
he
be
therefore
immediately
put
into
the
coach
,
though
the
day
be
far
spend
;
and
I
,
though
exceedingly
weak
,
accompany
him
in
the
journey
,
which
be
perform
by
the
light
of
flambeaus
,
and
render
unspeakably
shocking
,
by
the
dismal
apprehension
of
lose
him
every
moment
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
we
arrive
at
our
lodging
on
Pall
-
mall
,
where
I
lie
by
him
on
the
floor
,
and
attend
the
issue
of
his
distemper
,
in
all
the
agony
of
horror
and
despair
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
his
malady
settle
upon
his
brain
,
and
in
his
delirium
,
he
utter
such
dreadful
exclamation
,
as
be
sufficient
to
pierce
the
most
savage
heart
.
    
<EOS>
what
effect
then
must
they
have
have
on
mine
,
which
be
fraught
with
every
sentiment
of
the
most
melt
affection
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
common
grief
that
take
possession
of
my
soul
;
I
feel
all
the
aggravation
of
the
most
acute
distress
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
run
down
to
the
street
in
a
fit
of
distraction
:
I
send
for
the
doctor
every
minute
:
I
weary
heaven
with
my
prayer
;
even
now
my
heart
ake
at
the
remembrance
of
what
I
suffer
,
and
I
can
not
without
tremble
proceed
with
the
woeful
story
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
lain
insensible
some
day
,
he
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
and
call
upon
my
name
,
which
he
have
a
thousand
time
repeat
,
while
he
be
bereft
of
reason
.
<EOS>
all
hope
of
his
life
be
now
relinquish
,
and
I
be
lead
to
his
bed
-
side
to
receive
his
last
adieu
,
be
direct
to
summon
all
my
fortitude
,
and
suppress
my
sorrow
,
that
he
may
not
be
disturb
by
my
agitation
.
<EOS>
I
collect
all
my
resolution
to
support
me
in
this
affect
scene
:
I
see
my
dear
lord
in
extremity
;
the
beauty
of
his
youth
be
all
decay
,
yet
his
eye
,
though
languid
,
retain
unspeakable
sweetness
and
expression
.
<EOS>
He
feel
his
end
approach
,
put
forth
his
hand
,
and
with
a
look
full
of
complacency
and
benevolence
,
utter
such
a
tender
tale
 
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
how
have
I
deserve
such
accumulate
affliction
!
<EOS>
the
bare
remembrance
of
which
now
melt
me
into
tear
.
<EOS>
human
nature
could
not
undergo
my
situation
,
without
suffer
an
extasy
of
grief
!
<EOS>
I
clasp
him
in
my
arm
,
and
kiss
him
a
thousand
time
,
with
the
most
violent
emotion
of
woe
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
tear
from
his
embrace
,
and
in
a
little
time
he
be
ravish
for
ever
from
my
view
.
    
<EOS>
on
that
fatal
morning
,
which
put
a
period
to
his
life
,
I
see
the
duchess
of
L
#
#
#
#
approach
my
bed
,
and
,
from
her
appearance
,
conclude
that
he
be
no
more
;
yet
I
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
not
confirm
the
unhappy
presage
,
by
announce
his
death
;
and
she
accordingly
preserve
the
most
emphatic
silence
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
,
and
trod
softly
over
his
head
,
as
if
I
have
be
afraid
of
interrupt
his
repose
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
he
be
no
longer
sensible
of
such
disturbance
.
<EOS>
I
be
seize
with
a
stupification
of
sorrow
:
I
throw
up
the
window
,
and
look
around
,
think
the
sun
shine
with
the
most
dismal
aspect
;
every
thing
be
solitary
,
chearless
,
and
replete
with
horror
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
condition
I
be
,
by
the
direction
of
my
friend
,
convey
to
her
house
,
where
my
faculty
be
so
overpower
by
the
load
of
anguish
which
oppress
me
,
that
I
know
not
what
pass
during
the
first
day
of
my
unhappy
widowhood
:
this
only
I
know
,
the
kind
duchess
treat
me
with
all
imaginable
care
and
compassion
,
and
carry
me
to
her
country
-
house
,
where
I
stay
some
month
;
during
which
,
she
endeavour
to
comfort
me
with
all
the
amusement
she
could
invent
,
and
lay
me
under
such
obligation
,
as
shall
never
be
erase
from
my
remembrance
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
all
her
care
and
concern
,
I
be
,
by
my
excess
of
grief
,
plunge
into
a
languish
distemper
,
for
which
my
physician
advise
me
to
drink
the
Bath
water
.
    
<EOS>
in
compliance
with
this
prescription
,
I
go
thither
towards
the
end
of
summer
,
and
find
some
benefit
by
adhere
to
their
direction
;
though
I
seldom
go
abroad
,
except
when
I
visit
my
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
be
there
with
the
princess
;
and
upon
these
occasion
,
I
never
fail
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
company
,
who
be
strike
with
the
appearance
of
such
a
young
creature
in
weed
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
free
from
the
persecution
of
professed
admirer
;
but
be
dead
to
all
joy
,
I
be
deaf
to
the
voice
of
adulation
.
    
<EOS>
about
Christmas
,
I
repair
to
my
father
's
house
,
where
my
sorrow
be
revive
by
every
object
that
recall
the
idea
of
my
dear
lament
lord
.
<EOS>
but
these
melancholy
reflection
I
be
oblige
to
bear
,
because
I
have
no
other
home
or
habitation
,
be
leave
an
unprovided
widow
,
altogether
dependant
on
the
affection
of
my
own
family
.
    
<EOS>
during
this
winter
,
diver
overture
be
make
to
my
father
,
by
people
who
demand
me
in
marriage
;
but
my
heart
be
not
yet
sufficiently
wean
from
my
former
passion
,
to
admit
the
thought
of
another
master
.
<EOS>
among
those
that
present
their
proposal
,
be
a
certain
young
nobleman
,
who
upon
the
first
news
of
lord
W####m
's
death
,
come
post
from
Paris
,
in
order
to
declare
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
first
appearance
in
a
hire
chariot
and
six
,
accompany
by
a
big
fat
fellow
,
whom
(
as
I
afterwards
learn'd
)
he
have
engage
to
sound
his
praise
,
with
the
promise
of
a
thousand
pound
,
in
lieu
of
which
he
pay
him
with
forty
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
with
a
view
of
screen
himself
from
the
cold
,
or
of
make
a
comfortable
medium
in
case
of
be
overturn
,
and
fall
under
his
weighty
companion
,
I
know
not
;
but
certain
it
be
,
the
carriage
be
stuff
with
hay
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
when
he
arrive
,
the
servant
be
at
some
pain
in
rummage
and
remove
it
,
before
they
could
come
at
their
master
,
or
help
him
to
alight
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
be
lift
out
of
the
chariot
,
he
exhibit
a
very
ludicrous
figure
to
the
view
:
he
be
a
thin
,
meagre
,
shiver
creature
,
of
a
low
stature
,
with
little
black
eye
,
a
long
nose
,
sallow
complexion
,
and
pit
with
the
small
pox
,
dress
in
a
coat
of
light
brown
frize
,
line
with
pink
-
coloured
shag
,
a
monstrous
solitaire
and
bag
,
and
(
if
I
remember
aright
)
a
pair
of
huge
jack
-
boot
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
his
whole
appearance
be
so
little
calculated
for
inspire
love
,
that
I
have
(
on
the
strength
of
see
him
once
before
at
Oxford
)
set
him
down
as
the
last
man
on
earth
,
whom
I
would
chuse
to
we
would
;
and
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
that
he
be
,
in
every
particular
,
the
very
reverse
of
my
late
husband
.
    
<EOS>
as
my
father
be
not
at
home
,
he
stay
but
one
evening
,
and
leave
his
errand
with
my
mother
,
to
whom
he
be
as
disagreeable
as
to
myself
;
so
that
his
proposal
be
absolutely
reject
;
and
I
hear
no
more
of
him
during
the
space
of
three
whole
month
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
,
I
go
to
town
,
where
this
mortifying
figure
present
itself
again
,
and
renew
his
suit
,
offer
such
advantageous
term
of
settlement
,
that
my
father
begin
to
relish
the
match
,
and
warmly
recommend
it
to
my
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
's
relation
advise
me
to
embrace
the
opportunity
of
make
myself
independent
;
all
my
acquaintance
ply
me
with
with
argument
to
the
same
purpose
:
I
be
uneasy
at
home
,
and
indifferent
to
all
mankind
.
<EOS>
I
weigh
the
motive
with
the
objection
,
and
with
reluctance
yield
to
the
importunity
of
my
friend
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
determination
,
the
little
gentleman
be
permit
to
visit
me
;
and
the
manner
of
his
address
do
not
at
all
alter
the
opinion
I
have
conceive
of
his
character
and
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
even
shock
at
the
prospect
of
marry
a
man
whom
I
could
not
love
;
and
,
in
order
to
disburthen
my
own
conscience
,
take
an
opportunity
of
tell
him
one
evening
,
as
we
sit
opposite
to
each
other
,
that
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
command
my
affection
,
and
therefore
he
could
not
expect
the
possession
of
my
heart
,
lord
W####m
's
indulgence
have
spoil
me
for
a
wife
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
would
endeavour
to
contract
a
friendship
for
him
,
which
would
intirely
depend
upon
his
own
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
declaration
he
reply
(
to
my
great
surprize
)
that
he
do
not
desire
me
to
love
him
,
my
friendship
be
sufficient
;
and
next
day
,
repeat
this
strange
instance
of
moderation
in
a
letter
,
which
I
communicate
to
my
sister
,
who
laugh
heartily
at
the
content
,
and
persuade
me
,
that
since
I
could
love
no
man
,
he
be
the
proper
person
to
be
my
husband
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
wedding
cloath
and
equipage
be
prepare
,
the
day
 
the
fatal
day
be
fix
!
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
which
,
I
go
to
the
house
of
my
brother
-
in
-
law
duke
h
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
love
me
tenderly
,
and
take
my
leave
of
the
family
;
a
family
which
I
shall
always
remember
with
love
,
honour
,
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
His
grace
receive
me
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
say
at
parting
,
"
Lady
w####m
,
if
he
do
not
use
you
well
,
I
will
take
you
back

"
    
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
and
I
meet
at
Ox
 
chapel
,
where
the
ceremony
be
perform
by
the
bishop
of
W
#
#
#
#
,
in
presence
of
his
mother
,
my
father
,
and
another
lady
;
and
the
nuptial
knot
be
tie
,
we
set
out
for
my
father
's
house
in
the
country
,
and
proceed
full
twenty
mile
on
our
journey
,
before
my
lord
open
his
mouth
;
my
thought
have
be
all
that
time
employ
on
something
quite
foreign
to
my
present
situation
;
for
I
be
then
but
a
giddy
girl
of
eighteen
.
<EOS>
at
length
my
father
break
silence
,
and
clap
his
lordship
on
the
shoulder
,
tell
him
he
be
but
<EOS>
a
dull
bridegroom
;
upon
which
,
my
lord
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
be
out
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
this
dejection
continue
all
the
day
,
notwithstanding
the
refreshment
of
a
plentiful
dinner
,
which
he
eat
upon
the
road
;
and
in
the
evening
we
arrive
at
the
place
of
destination
,
where
we
be
kindly
receive
by
my
mother
,
though
she
have
no
like
to
the
match
;
and
after
supper
,
we
retire
to
our
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
I
have
occasion
to
perceive
the
most
disagreeable
contrast
between
my
present
help
-
mate
and
my
former
lord
:
instead
of
fly
to
my
arm
with
all
the
eagerness
of
love
and
rapture
,
this
manly
representative
sit
mope
in
a
corner
,
like
a
criminal
on
execution
-
day
,
and
own
he
be
ashamed
to
bed
a
woman
,
whose
hand
he
have
scarce
ever
touch
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
be
affect
with
this
pusilanimous
behaviour
:
I
remember
lord
W####m
,
while
I
survey
the
object
before
me
,
and
make
such
a
comparison
as
fill
me
with
horror
and
disgust
:
nay
,
to
such
a
degree
do
my
aversion
to
this
phantom
prevail
,
that
I
begin
to
sweat
with
anguish
at
the
thought
of
be
subject
to
his
pleasure
:
and
when
,
after
a
long
hesitation
,
he
venture
to
approach
me
,
I
tremble
as
if
I
have
be
expose
to
the
embrace
of
a
rattlesnake
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
effort
of
his
love
diminish
this
antipathy
;
his
attempt
be
like
the
pawing
of
an
imp
,
send
from
hell
to
teize
and
torment
some
guilty
wretch
,
<EOS>
such
as
be
exhibit
in
some
dramatic
performance
,
which
I
never
see
act
,
without
remember
my
wedding
-
night
.
    
<EOS>
by
such
shadowy
,
unsubstantial
,
vexatious
behaviour
,
be
I
tantalize
,
and
robb'd
of
my
repose
;
and
early
next
morning
I
get
up
,
with
a
most
sovereign
contempt
for
my
bedfellow
,
who
indulge
himself
in
bed
till
eleven
.
    
<EOS>
have
pass
a
few
day
in
this
place
,
I
go
home
with
him
to
his
house
at
Twickenham
;
and
soon
after
we
be
present
at
court
,
when
the
queen
be
pleased
to
say
to
my
lord
's
mother
,
she
do
not
doubt
that
we
should
be
an
happy
couple
,
for
I
have
be
a
good
wife
to
my
former
husband
.
    
<EOS>
whatever
deficiency
I
have
to
complain
of
in
my
new
spouse
,
he
be
not
want
in
point
of
liberality
:
I
be
present
with
a
very
fine
chariot
stud
with
silver
nail
,
and
such
a
profusion
of
jewel
as
furnish
a
joke
to
some
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
observe
that
I
be
formerly
queen
of
heart
,
but
now
metamorphose
into
the
queen
of
diamond
.
<EOS>
this
uncommon
splendour
attract
the
eye
and
envy
of
my
competitor
,
who
be
the
more
implacable
in
their
resentment
,
because
,
notwithstanding
my
marriage
,
I
be
as
much
as
ever
follow
by
the
man
of
gallantry
and
pleasure
,
among
whom
it
be
a
constant
maxim
,
that
a
woman
never
with
-
hold
her
affection
from
her
husband
,
without
an
intention
to
bestow
them
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
never
appear
without
a
train
of
admirer
,
and
my
house
in
the
country
be
always
croude
with
gay
young
man
of
quality
.
    
<EOS>
among
those
who
cultivate
my
good
grace
with
the
great
skill
and
assiduity
,
be
the
earl
c
#
#
#
#
,
and
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
brother
to
lord
F
#
#
#
#
.
    
<EOS>
the
former
of
whom
,
in
the
course
of
his
address
,
treat
me
with
an
entertainment
of
surprising
magnificence
,
dispose
into
a
dinner
,
supper
,
and
ball
;
to
which
I
,
at
his
desire
,
invite
eleven
lady
,
whom
he
pair
with
the
like
number
of
his
own
sex
:
so
that
the
whole
company
amount
to
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
We
be
regale
with
a
most
elegant
dinner
,
in
an
apartment
which
be
altogether
superb
,
and
serve
by
gentleman
only
,
no
livery
-
servant
be
permit
to
come
within
the
door
.
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
we
embark
in
two
splendid
barge
,
be
attend
by
a
band
of
musick
,
in
a
third
;
and
enjoy
a
delightful
evening
upon
the
river
,
till
the
twilight
,
when
we
return
,
and
begin
the
ball
,
which
be
conduct
with
such
order
and
taste
,
that
mirth
and
good
humour
prevail
,
and
no
dissatisfaction
appear
,
except
in
the
countenance
of
one
old
maid
,
since
marry
to
a
son
of
the
duke
of
 
,
who
,
tho
'
she
would
not
refuse
to
partake
of
such
an
agreeable
entertainment
,
be
displeased
that
I
should
have
the
honour
of
invite
her
.
<EOS>
o
baleful
Envy
!
<EOS>
thou
self
-
torment
fiend
!
<EOS>
how
do'st
thou
predominate
in
all
assembly
,
from
the
grand
gala
of
a
court
to
the
meeting
of
simple
peasant
at
their
harvest
-
home
!
<EOS>
nor
be
the
prevalence
of
this
sordid
passion
to
be
wonder
at
,
if
we
consider
the
weakness
,
pride
,
and
vanity
of
our
sex
.
<EOS>
the
presence
of
one
favourite
man
shall
poison
the
enjoyment
of
a
whole
company
,
and
produce
the
most
rancorous
enmity
betwixt
the
close
friend
.
    
<EOS>
I
dance
with
the
master
of
the
ball
,
who
employ
all
the
artillery
of
his
eloquence
in
make
love
;
yet
I
do
not
listen
to
his
address
,
for
he
be
not
to
my
taste
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
possess
an
agreeable
person
,
and
a
good
acquire
understanding
;
but
he
be
utterly
ignorant
of
that
gentle
prevail
art
which
I
afterwards
experience
in
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
and
which
be
the
only
method
he
could
have
successfully
practise
,
in
seduce
a
young
woman
like
me
,
bear
with
sentiment
of
honour
,
and
train
up
in
the
path
of
religion
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
absolutely
master
of
those
insinuating
qualification
which
few
woman
of
passion
and
sensibility
can
resist
;
and
have
a
person
every
way
adapt
for
profit
by
these
insidious
talent
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
acquaint
with
the
human
heart
,
conscious
of
his
own
power
and
capacity
,
and
exercise
these
endowment
with
unwearied
perseverance
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
and
thin
,
which
be
perfectly
agreeable
to
my
taste
,
with
large
blue
eloquent
eye
,
good
tooth
,
and
a
long
head
turn
to
gallantry
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
be
the
standard
of
politeness
,
and
all
his
advance
be
conduct
with
the
most
profound
respect
;
which
be
the
most
effectual
expedient
a
man
can
use
against
us
,
if
he
can
find
mean
to
persuade
us
,
that
it
proceed
from
the
excess
and
delicacy
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
other
than
a
silent
compliment
,
by
which
our
accomplishment
be
continually
flatter
,
and
please
in
proportion
to
the
suppose
understanding
of
him
who
pay
it
.
    
<EOS>
by
these
art
and
advantage
this
consummate
politician
in
love
begin
by
degree
to
sap
the
foundation
of
my
conjugal
faith
;
he
steal
imperceptibly
into
my
affection
,
and
,
by
dint
of
opportunity
,
which
he
well
know
how
to
improve
,
triumph
,
at
last
,
over
all
his
rival
.
    
<EOS>
nor
be
he
the
only
person
that
dispute
my
heart
with
Earl
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
also
rival
by
lord
C
#
#
#
#
h
#
#
#
#
,
a
Scotchman
,
who
have
be
an
intimate
and
relation
of
my
former
husband
.
    
<EOS>
this
gentleman
I
would
have
prefer
to
most
of
his
competitor
,
and
I
coquet
with
him
for
some
time
:
but
this
amour
be
interrupt
by
his
go
to
Ireland
;
upon
which
occasion
,
understand
that
he
be
but
indifferently
provide
with
money
,
I
make
him
a
present
of
a
gold
snuff
-
box
,
in
which
be
inclose
a
bank
-
note
;
a
trifle
mark
of
my
esteem
,
which
he
afterwards
justify
by
the
most
grateful
,
friendly
,
and
genteel
behaviour
;
and
as
we
correspond
by
letter
,
I
frankly
tell
him
,
that
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
have
stept
in
,
and
win
the
palm
from
all
the
rest
of
my
admirer
.
    
<EOS>
this
new
favourite
's
mother
and
sister
,
who
live
in
the
neighbourhood
,
be
my
constant
companion
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
this
intimacy
,
he
never
let
a
day
pass
without
pay
his
respect
to
me
in
person
;
<EOS>
nay
,
so
ingenious
be
he
in
contrive
the
mean
of
promote
his
suit
,
that
whether
I
ride
or
walk
,
go
abroad
or
stay
at
home
,
he
be
always
of
course
one
of
the
party
:
so
that
his
design
seem
to
ingross
his
whole
vigilance
and
attention
.
<EOS>
thus
he
study
my
disposition
,
and
establish
himself
in
my
good
opinion
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
He
find
my
heart
be
susceptible
of
every
tender
impression
,
and
see
that
I
be
not
free
from
the
vanity
of
youth
;
he
have
already
acquire
my
friendship
and
esteem
,
from
which
he
know
there
be
a
short
and
easy
transition
to
love
;
and
by
his
penetration
choose
proper
season
for
the
theme
,
urge
it
with
such
pathetic
vow
and
artful
adulation
,
as
well
may
captivate
a
young
woman
of
my
complexion
and
inexperience
,
and
circumstance
as
I
be
,
with
a
husband
whom
I
have
such
reason
to
despise
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
he
thus
make
an
insensible
progress
in
my
heart
,
he
do
not
find
my
virtue
an
easy
conquest
;
and
I
myself
be
ignorant
of
the
advantage
he
have
gain
,
with
regard
to
my
inclination
,
until
I
be
convince
of
his
success
by
an
alarm
of
jealousy
which
I
one
day
feel
,
at
see
him
engage
in
conversation
with
another
lady
.
<EOS>
I
forthwith
recognize
this
symptom
of
love
,
with
which
I
have
be
formerly
acquaint
,
and
tremble
at
the
discovery
of
my
own
weakness
.
<EOS>
I
undergo
a
strange
agitation
and
mixture
of
contrary
sensation
:
I
be
pleased
with
the
passion
,
yet
ashamed
of
avow
it
even
to
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
the
right
of
a
husband
(
tho
'
mine
be
but
a
nominal
one
)
<EOS>
occur
to
my
reflexion
,
and
virtue
,
modesty
and
honour
forbad
me
to
cherish
the
guilty
flame
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
encourage
these
laudable
scruple
,
and
resolve
to
sacrifice
my
love
to
duty
and
reputation
,
my
lord
be
almost
every
day
employ
in
ride
post
to
my
father
,
with
complaint
of
my
conduct
,
which
be
hitherto
irreproachable
;
tho
'
the
great
grievance
which
he
pretend
to
have
suffer
,
be
my
refusing
to
comply
with
his
desire
,
when
he
intreate
me
to
lie
a
whole
hour
every
morning
,
with
my
neck
uncover
,
<EOS>
that
by
gaze
he
may
quiet
the
perturbation
of
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
from
this
request
you
may
judge
of
the
man
,
as
well
as
of
the
regard
I
must
entertain
for
his
character
and
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
during
the
whole
summer
I
be
besiege
by
my
artful
undoer
,
and
in
the
autumn
set
out
with
my
lord
for
Bath
,
where
,
by
reason
of
the
intimacy
that
subsist
between
our
family
,
we
live
in
the
same
house
with
my
lover
and
his
sister
,
who
,
with
another
agreeable
young
lady
,
accompany
us
in
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
have
extort
from
me
a
confession
of
a
mutual
flame
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
assure
him
that
it
should
never
induce
me
to
give
up
the
valuable
possession
of
an
unspotted
character
,
and
a
conscience
void
of
offence
.
<EOS>
I
offer
him
all
the
enjoyment
he
could
reap
from
an
unreserved
intercourse
of
soul
,
abstract
from
any
sensual
consideration
;
and
he
eagerly
embrace
the
platonic
proposal
,
because
he
have
sagacity
enough
to
foresee
the
issue
of
such
chimerical
contract
,
and
know
me
too
well
to
think
he
could
accomplish
his
purpose
without
seem
to
acquiesce
in
my
own
term
,
and
cultivate
my
tenderness
under
the
specious
pretext
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
agreement
we
take
all
opportunity
of
see
each
other
in
private
;
and
these
interview
be
spend
in
mutual
protestation
of
disinterested
love
.
<EOS>
this
correspondence
,
tho
'
dangerous
,
be
(
on
my
side
)
equally
innocent
and
endearing
;
and
many
happy
hour
<EOS>
we
pass'd
,
before
my
sentiment
be
discover
.
<EOS>
at
length
my
lover
be
take
ill
,
and
then
my
passion
burst
out
beyond
the
power
of
concealment
;
my
grief
and
anxiety
become
so
conspicuous
in
my
countenance
,
and
my
behaviour
be
so
indiscreet
,
that
every
body
in
the
house
perceive
the
situation
of
my
thought
,
and
blame
my
conduct
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
Certain
<EOS>
it
be
I
be
extremely
imprudent
,
tho
'
intentionally
innocent
.
<EOS>
I
have
lie
whole
night
by
my
lord
,
who
teize
and
torment
me
for
that
which
neither
I
could
give
nor
he
could
take
,
and
ruminate
on
the
fatal
consequence
of
this
unhappy
flame
,
until
I
be
work
into
a
fever
of
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
I
see
there
be
no
safety
but
in
flight
,
and
often
determine
to
banish
myself
for
ever
from
the
sight
of
this
dangerous
intruder
.
<EOS>
but
my
resolution
always
fail
at
the
approach
of
day
,
and
my
desire
of
see
him
as
constantly
recur
.
<EOS>
so
far
be
I
from
persist
in
such
commendable
determination
,
that
,
on
the
eve
of
our
departure
from
Bath
,
I
feel
the
keen
pang
of
sorrow
at
our
approach
separation
;
and
as
we
could
not
enjoy
our
private
interview
at
my
house
in
town
,
I
promise
to
visit
him
at
his
own
apartment
,
after
he
have
swear
by
all
that
be
sacred
,
that
he
would
take
no
sinister
advantage
of
my
condescension
,
by
presume
upon
the
opportunity
I
should
give
.
    
<EOS>
He
keep
his
word
;
for
he
see
I
trust
to
it
with
fear
and
tremble
,
and
perceive
that
my
apprehension
be
not
affect
,
but
the
natural
concern
of
a
young
creature
,
distract
between
love
and
duty
,
whom
,
have
he
alarm
,
he
never
would
have
see
within
his
door
again
.
<EOS>
instead
of
press
me
with
sollicitation
in
favour
of
his
passion
,
he
be
more
than
ever
respectful
and
complaisant
;
so
that
I
find
myself
disengaged
of
all
restraint
,
conduct
the
conversation
,
shorten
and
repeat
my
visit
,
at
my
own
pleasure
,
till
,
at
last
<EOS>
,
I
become
so
accustomed
to
this
communication
,
that
his
house
be
as
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
.
    
<EOS>
have
in
this
manner
secure
himself
in
my
confidence
,
he
resume
the
favourite
topic
of
love
,
and
warm
my
imagination
by
gradual
advance
on
the
subject
,
my
heart
begin
to
pant
;
and
when
he
see
me
thus
,
he
snatch
the
favourable
occasion
to
practise
all
his
eloquence
and
art
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
resist
his
energy
,
nor
even
fly
from
the
temptation
that
assail
me
,
until
he
have
obtain
a
promise
that
he
should
,
at
our
next
meeting
,
reap
the
fruit
of
his
tedious
expectation
.
<EOS>
upon
this
condition
I
be
permit
to
retire
,
and
bless
heaven
for
my
escape
,
fully
determined
to
continue
in
the
path
of
virtue
I
have
hitherto
trod
,
and
stifle
the
criminal
flame
,
by
which
my
peace
and
reputation
be
endanger
.
<EOS>
but
his
idea
,
which
reign
within
my
heart
,
without
controul
,
soon
baffle
all
those
prudent
suggestion
.
    
<EOS>
I
see
him
again
;
and
he
remind
me
of
my
promise
,
which
I
endeavour
to
evade
with
affected
pleasantry
;
upon
which
he
manifest
the
utmost
displeasure
and
chagrin
,
shed
some
crocodile
tear
,
and
upbraid
me
with
levity
and
indifference
.
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
he
have
sollicite
my
favour
for
ten
long
month
,
without
intermission
,
and
imagine
I
have
hold
out
so
long
on
virtuous
motive
only
;
but
now
he
could
plainly
perceive
that
his
want
of
success
have
be
owe
to
my
want
of
affection
;
and
that
all
my
profession
be
insincere
:
in
a
word
,
he
persuade
me
,
that
his
remonstrance
be
just
and
reasonable
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
the
affliction
of
a
man
I
love
,
when
I
know
it
be
in
my
power
to
remove
it
;
and
rather
than
forfeit
his
opinion
of
my
sincerity
and
love
,
I
consent
to
his
wish
.
<EOS>
My
heart
now
flutter
at
the
remembrance
of
the
dear
,
tho
'
fatal
indiscretion
;
yet
I
reflect
without
remorse
,
and
even
remember
it
with
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
if
I
could
not
avoid
the
censure
of
the
world
,
I
be
resolve
to
bear
it
without
repine
;
and
sure
the
guilt
(
if
there
be
any
in
my
conduct
)
be
but
venial
;
for
I
consider
myself
as
a
person
absolve
of
all
matrimonial
tie
,
by
the
insignificance
of
lord
  
,
who
,
tho
'
a
nominal
husband
,
be
,
in
fact
,
a
mere
non
-
entity
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
contract
a
new
engagement
with
my
lover
,
to
which
I
resolve
to
adhere
with
the
most
scrupulous
fidelity
,
without
the
least
intention
of
injure
my
lord
or
his
relation
;
for
have
our
mutual
passion
produce
any
visible
effect
,
I
would
immediately
have
renounce
and
abandon
my
husband
for
ever
,
that
the
fruit
of
my
love
for
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
may
not
have
inherit
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
right
heir
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
determination
,
which
I
think
just
,
if
not
prudent
;
and
for
which
I
have
incur
the
imputation
of
folly
,
in
the
opinion
of
this
wise
and
honest
generation
,
by
whose
example
and
advice
I
have
,
since
that
time
,
be
a
little
reform
in
point
of
prudential
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
still
retain
a
strong
tendency
to
return
to
my
primitive
way
of
thinking
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
quit
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
after
the
sacrifice
I
have
make
,
and
return
to
my
own
bed
,
it
may
perhaps
be
suppose
that
I
sleep
but
little
.
<EOS>
true
:
I
be
keep
awake
by
the
joyful
impatience
of
revisit
my
lover
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
neglect
no
opportunity
of
fly
to
his
arm
:
when
lord
   
be
in
the
country
we
enjoy
each
other
's
company
without
interruption
,
but
when
he
reside
in
town
our
correspondence
be
limit
to
steal
interview
,
which
be
unspeakably
delicious
,
as
genuine
love
preside
at
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
Such
be
my
happiness
,
in
the
course
of
this
tender
communication
,
that
to
this
day
I
remember
it
with
pleasure
,
tho
'
<EOS>
it
have
cost
me
dear
in
the
sequel
,
and
be
at
that
time
enjoy
at
a
considerable
expence
;
for
I
devote
myself
so
intirely
to
my
lover
,
who
be
desirous
of
engross
my
time
and
thought
,
that
my
acquaintance
,
which
be
very
numerous
,
justly
accuse
me
of
neglect
,
and
of
consequence
cool
in
their
friendship
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
all
for
love
,
or
the
world
well
lose
.
<EOS>
and
be
the
same
opportunity
to
offer
,
I
would
act
the
same
conduct
over
again
.
    
<EOS>
some
there
be
who
possibly
may
wonder
how
I
could
love
twice
with
such
violence
of
affection
:
but
all
such
observer
must
be
unacquainted
with
the
human
heart
.
<EOS>
Mine
be
naturally
adapt
for
the
tender
passion
,
and
have
be
so
fortunate
,
so
cherish
,
in
its
first
impression
,
that
it
feel
with
joy
the
same
sensation
revive
,
when
influence
by
the
same
engaging
qualification
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
I
love
the
second
time
as
well
as
the
first
,
and
better
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
give
up
my
all
for
both
:
fortune
and
my
father
's
favour
for
the
one
;
reputation
,
friend
,
and
fortune
for
the
other
.
<EOS>
yet
,
notwithstanding
this
intimate
connexion
,
I
do
not
relinquish
the
world
all
at
once
;
on
the
contrary
I
still
appear
at
court
,
and
attract
the
notice
and
approbation
of
my
royal
patroness
;
I
dance
with
the
p
#
#
#
#
of
W
#
#
#
#
;
a
circumstance
which
so
nearly
affect
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
present
,
that
,
in
order
to
manifest
his
resentment
,
he
choose
the
ugliest
woman
in
the
ball
for
his
partner
;
and
I
no
sooner
perceive
his
uneasiness
than
I
give
over
,
with
a
view
of
appease
his
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
without
repeat
particular
circumstance
,
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
our
mutual
passion
be
a
perfect
copy
of
that
which
have
subsist
between
me
and
my
dear
lord
w####m
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
jealous
,
melt
and
delicate
,
and
checquere
with
little
accident
,
which
serve
to
animate
and
maintain
the
flame
,
in
its
first
ardency
of
rapture
.
<EOS>
when
my
lover
be
sick
,
I
attend
and
nurse
him
with
indefatigable
tenderness
and
care
;
and
during
an
indisposition
which
I
catch
in
the
performance
of
this
agreeable
office
,
he
discharge
the
obligation
with
all
the
warmth
of
sympathy
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
judge
necessary
by
the
physician
,
that
I
should
use
the
Bath
-
water
for
the
recovery
of
my
health
;
and
I
set
out
for
that
place
,
glad
of
a
pretence
to
be
absent
from
lord
  
,
with
whom
I
live
on
very
unhappy
term
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
about
nine
month
after
our
marriage
,
desire
that
we
may
sleep
in
separate
bed
,
and
give
a
very
whimsical
reason
for
this
proposal
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
immensity
of
his
love
deprive
him
of
the
power
of
gratification
,
and
that
some
commerce
with
an
object
,
to
which
his
heart
be
not
attach
,
may
,
by
diminish
the
transport
of
his
spirit
,
recompose
his
nerve
,
and
enable
him
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
good
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
make
no
objection
to
this
plan
,
which
be
immediately
put
in
execution
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
address
to
a
nymph
of
Drury
-
lane
,
whose
name
(
as
he
tell
me
)
be
Mrs
Rock
.
<EOS>
She
make
shift
to
extract
some
money
from
her
patient
;
but
his
infirmity
be
beyond
the
power
of
her
art
;
though
she
make
some
mischief
between
us
;
and
I
communicate
my
suspicion
to
duke
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
intend
to
have
expostulate
with
her
upon
the
subject
;
but
she
get
intimation
of
his
design
,
and
save
him
the
trouble
,
by
a
precipitate
retreat
.
    
<EOS>
after
my
return
from
the
Bath
,
where
Mr
S
and
I
have
live
happily
,
until
we
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
my
husband
,
his
lordship
express
an
inclination
to
be
my
bedfellow
again
;
but
in
this
particular
I
desire
to
be
excuse
:
for
though
I
would
not
be
the
first
to
propose
the
separation
,
which
,
though
usual
in
other
country
,
be
contrary
to
the
custom
of
England
,
be
unwilling
to
furnish
the
least
handle
for
censure
,
as
my
character
be
still
unblemished
;
yet
,
when
the
proposal
come
from
himself
,
I
think
myself
intitle
to
refuse
a
re
-
union
,
to
which
I
accordingly
object
.
    
<EOS>
this
opposition
produce
a
quarrel
,
which
rise
to
a
state
of
perpetual
animosity
;
so
that
we
begin
to
talk
of
parting
.
<EOS>
My
lord
relish
the
expedient
,
agree
to
add
three
hundred
pound
a
year
to
my
pin
-
money
,
which
(
by
the
bye
)
be
never
pay
;
and
I
renounce
all
state
and
grandeur
,
to
live
in
a
small
house
that
I
hire
at
Casehorton
,
where
I
pass
my
time
for
two
month
,
in
the
most
agreeable
retirement
,
with
my
dear
over
,
till
I
be
disturb
by
the
intrusion
of
my
Lord
,
who
molest
me
with
visit
and
solicitation
to
return
,
pretend
that
he
have
change
his
mind
,
and
insist
upon
my
compliance
with
his
desire
.
    
<EOS>
I
exhaust
my
invention
in
endeavour
to
evade
his
request
;
but
he
persecute
me
without
cease
:
so
that
I
be
fain
to
capitulate
,
on
condition
that
we
should
immediately
set
out
for
France
;
and
that
he
should
not
presume
to
approach
my
bed
,
till
our
arrival
at
Calais
.
<EOS>
We
accordingly
depart
for
that
kingdom
;
and
,
far
from
infringe
the
last
article
of
our
treaty
,
his
lordship
do
not
insist
upon
his
privilege
,
before
we
reach
the
capital
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
begin
to
feel
the
effect
of
my
passion
in
a
very
interesting
manner
,
and
communicate
my
discovery
to
the
dear
author
of
it
,
who
would
not
leave
me
in
such
an
affect
situation
,
but
take
the
first
opportunity
of
follow
us
to
France
.
    
<EOS>
in
our
road
to
Paris
,
we
stopp'd
to
visit
Chantilly
,
a
magnificent
Chateau
belong
to
the
prince
of
Conde
,
and
there
meet
by
accident
with
some
english
nobleman
,
to
whom
I
be
know
.
<EOS>
the
prince
and
his
sister
invite
me
very
politely
into
the
gallery
where
they
sit
.
<EOS>
They
compliment
me
on
my
person
,
and
seem
to
admire
my
dress
,
which
be
altogether
new
to
them
,
be
a
blue
english
riding
-
habit
trim
with
gold
,
and
an
hat
with
a
feather
.
<EOS>
They
be
particularly
well
pleased
with
my
hair
,
which
hang
down
to
my
waist
,
and
press
me
to
stay
a
fortnight
at
their
house
;
an
invitation
which
I
be
very
much
mortify
at
be
oblige
to
refuse
,
because
my
lord
do
not
understand
the
french
language
.
<EOS>
I
be
inchante
with
the
place
and
the
company
,
the
woman
be
amiable
and
the
man
polite
;
nor
be
they

my

and
story

call
at
the
same
place
a
few
day
after
,
they
rally
him
on
my
account
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
Paris
,
the
first
thing
I
do
be
to
metamorphose
myself
into
a
french
woman
.
<EOS>
I
cut
off
my
hair
,
hide
a
very
good
complexion
of
my
own
with
Rouge
,
reconcile
myself
to
powder
,
which
I
have
never

before
,
put
on
a
robe
with
a
large
hoop
,
and
go
to
the
Thuilleries
,
full
of
spirit
and
joy
;
for
at
that
time
every
thing
conspire
to
make
me
happy
:
    
<EOS>
I
have
health
,
youth
and
beauty
,
love
,
vanity
and
affluence
,
and
find
myself
surround
with
diversion
,
which
be
gay
,
new
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
My
appearance
draw
upon
me
the
eye
of
the
whole
company
,
who
consider
me
as
a
stranger
,
but
not
a
foreigner
,
so
compleatly
be
I
equip
in
the
fashion
of
the
French
;
and
when
they
understand
who
I
be
,
they
applaud
my
person
with
the
most
lavish
encomium
,
accord
to
their
know
politeness
.

.
<EOS>
We
sup
all
together
in
the
saloon
,
which
,
though
small
,
be
perfectly
elegant
.
<EOS>
the
company
be
always
good
-
humour
,
the
conversation
sprightly
and
joyous
,
and
the
scene
,
though
often
repeat
,
still
delightful
and
entertaining
.
    
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
and
I
use
to
pass
our
evening
at
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
which
his
highness
lend
us
for
our
accommodation
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
open
into
the
garden
of
the
Luxembourg
,
and
be
,
in
point
of
magnificence
,
suitable
to
the
owner
.
<EOS>
Thither
I
use
to
repair
in
a
flaming
equipage
,
on
pretence
of
visit
,
and
spend
the
good
part
of
the
night
with
him
,
who
be
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
prince
in
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
be
happily
engage
in
these
ravish
party
,
my
little
lord
be
employ
in
effort
to
recover
his
health
by
restorative
,
and
I
know
not
what
;
for
he
still
lament
the
enfeeble
effect
of
his
passion
,
and
complain
,
that
he
love
me
more
like
an
angel
than
a
woman
,
though
he
strove
to
govern
his
affection
accord
to
the
doctrine
of
the
christian
religion
,
as
he
regulate
his
life
by
the
maxim
of
Charles
the
twelfth
of
Sweden
.
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
this
declaration
I
could
never
learn
;
and
indeed
,
I
have
be
often
tempt
to
believe
he
have
no
meaning
at
all
.
    
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
I
find
my
size
visibly
increase
,
and
my
situation
extremely
uneasy
,
on
account
of
the
perpetual
wrangling
which
prevail
betwixt
us
,
in
consequence
of
his
desiring
to
sleep
with
me
again
,
after
we
have
part
bed
for
the
second
time
:
and
,
that
I
may
be
no
longer
expose
to
such
disagreeable
persecution
,
I
resolve
to
leave
him
,
though
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
thus
determine
,
I
go
to
the
british
embassador
in
an
hackney
coach
;
and
,
in
order
to
disguise
my
youth
,
which
may
have
prepossess
him
against
my
judgment
,
muffle
myself
up
in
a
black
hood
,
which
(
as
he
say
)
instead
of
lend
an
air
of
gravity
to
my
countenance
,
add
a
wildness
to
my
look
,
which
be
far
from
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
gallant
man
in
his
youth
,
and
even
then
,
though
well
stricken
in
year
,
be
not
insensible
to
the
power
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
this
disposition
,
perhaps
,
render
him
more
favourable
to
my
cause
,
though
he
at
first
advise
me
to
return
to
my
husband
;
but
find
me
obstinate
,
he
undertake
to
serve
me
in
my
own
way
,
and
procure
a
protection
from
the
french
king
,
by
virtue
of
which
,
I
could
live
at
Paris
unmoleste
by
my
lord
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
advise
me
(
if
I
be
determined
to
leave
him
)
to
make
the
good
of
my
way
to
England
,
and
sue
for
a
divorce
.
    
<EOS>
I
relish
his
opinion
,
and
conceal
myself
about
three
day
in
Paris
,
during
which
I
borrow
some
linen
;
for
,
as
it
be
impossible
to
convey
any
thing
out
of
my
own
house
without
suspicion
,
I
have
neither
cloath
for
my
accommodation
,
nor
a
servant
to
wait
on
me
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
solitary
condition
I
take
the
road
to
Flanders
,
after
I
have
put
my
lord
upon
a
wrong
scent
,
by
write
a
letter
to
him
,
date
at
Calais
,
and
travel
through
an
unknown
country
,
without
any
other
attendant
than
the
postilion
,
be
subject
to
this
inconvenience
by
the
law
of
France
,
which
be
so
severe
in
some
particular
,
that
if
any
person
have
be
apprehend
with
me
,
he
would
have
suffer
death
,
for
go
off
with
a
man
's
wife
;
though
any
man
may
go
to
bed
with
the
same
woman
,
without
fear
of
incur
any
legal
punishment
.
    
<EOS>
I
proceed
night
and
day
without
intermission
,
that
I
may
the
sooner
reach
Flanders
,
where
I
know
I
should
be
safe
;
and
as
the
night
be
excessively
cold
,
I
be
fain
to
wrap
myself
up
in
flannel
,
which
I
buy
for
the
purpose
,
as
I
have
no
cloath
to
keep
me
warm
,
and
travel
in
an
open
chaise
.
<EOS>
while
we
pass
through
dreary
wood
,
quite
remote
from
the
habitation
of
man
,
I
be
not
without
apprehension
of
be
strip
and
murthere
by
the
postilion
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
owe
my
safety
to
the
indigence
of
my
appearance
,
which
may
also
protect
me
in
two
miserable
place
where
I
be
oblige
to
lie
,
before
I
get
out
of
the
territory
of
France
;
for
,
as
I
could
not
reach
the
great
town
where
I
intend
to
lodge
,
I
be
under
the
necessity
of
put
up
at
little
wretched
hovel
,
where
no
provision
be
to
be
have
,
but
four
brown
bread
and
sourer
cheese
;
and
every
thing
seem
to
denote
the
den
of
despair
and
assassination
.
    
<EOS>
I
make
shift
,
however
,
to
subsist
on
this
fare
,
uncomfortable
as
it
be
,
confide
in
the
meanness
of
my
equipage
for
the
security
of
my
person
;
and
at
length
arrive
at
Brussels
,
fix
my
quarter
in
the
Hotel
de
Flandre
<EOS>
(
so
well
known
to
the
English
since
)
where
I
think
myself
extremely
happy
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
flight
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
full
two
day
in
this
place
,
when
I
be
bless
with
the
sight
of
my
lover
;
and
have
concerted
measure
for
proceed
to
England
,
I
hire
a
tall
fine
Liegeoise
for
a
maid
;
and
set
out
for
Ostend
<EOS>
,
we
embark
in
a
vessel
,
in
which
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
have
bespeak
our
passage
.
<EOS>
Our
voyage
be
short
and
prosperous
,
and
the
time
most
agreeably
spend
in
the
company
of
my
dear
partner
,
who
be
a
most
engaging
man
in
all
respect
,
as
I
dare
say
my
lady
o
#
#
#
#
have
since
find
him
.
    
<EOS>
I
assume
a
fictitious
name
,
take
private
lodging
in
Poland
-
street
,
retained
lawyer
,
and
commence
a
suit
for
separation
against
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
communicate
the
reason
of
my
elopement
to
my
father
,
who
be
shocked
and
surprised
at
my
conduct
,
which
he
condemn
with
expression
of
sorrow
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
but
the
step
be
take
;
nor
do
I
repent
of
what
I
have
do
,
except
on
his
account
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
morning
after
my
arrival
at
London
,
I
wait
upon
the
lord
-
chief
-
justice
,
to
whom
I
complain
of
the
usage
I
have
receive
from
my
lord
,
whose
temper
be
teazing
,
tiresome
,
and
intolerably
capricious
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
be
a
strange
compound
of
madness
and
folly
,
season
with
a
small
proportion
of
sense
:
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
that
I
,
who
be
hot
and
hasty
,
should
be
wretched
,
under
the
persecution
of
such
a
perverse
humourist
,
who
use
to
terrify
me
,
and
scold
at
me
the
whole
night
without
intermission
,
and
shake
my
pillow
from
time
to
time
,
that
I
may
not
sleep
,
while
he
torment
me
with
his
disagreeable
expostulation
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
be
often
frighten
almost
out
of
my
sense
,
at
see
him
convulse
by
the
most
unreasonable
passion
;
and
chagrin
to
the
high
degree
of
disgust
,
to
find
(
by
repeat
observation
)
his
disposition
so
preposterous
,
that
his
satisfaction
and
displeasure
never
depend
upon
the
cause
he
have
to
be
satisfy
or
disoblige
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
when
he
have
most
reason
to
be
pleased
,
he
be
always
most
discontent
,
and
very
often
in
good
humour
,
when
he
have
reason
enough
for
vexation
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
live
in
Poland
-
street
,
I
be
engage
with
lawyer
,
and
so
often
visit
by
my
father
,
that
I
could
not
dedicate
my
whole
time
,
as
usual
,
to
my
lover
;
nor
be
it
convenient
that
he
should
be
see
in
my
company
:
he
therefore
take
a
small
house
at
Camberwell
,
whither
<EOS>
I
go
as
often
as
I
have
an
opportunity
;
and
maintain
the
correspondence
with
such
eagerness
and
industry
,
that
although
I
be
six
month
go
with
child
,
I
have
often
,
by
myself
,
set
out
for
his
habitation
,
in
an
hackney
-
coach
,
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
and
return
by
six
in
the
morning
,
that
I
may
be
in
my
own
bed
,
when
my
father
come
to
see
me
;
for
I
conceal
my
amour
,
as
well
as
the
effect
of
it
,
from
his
knowledge
,
and
frequently
take
water
from
the
Bridge
,
that
my
motion
may
not
be
discover
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
most
passionate
love
could
have
support
my
spirit
under
such
vicissitude
of
fatigue
,
or
enable
my
admirer
to
spend
whole
day
by
himself
,
in
such
a
solitary
retirement
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
my
lord
be
arrive
in
England
,
and
employ
in
discover
the
place
of
my
retreat
;
so
that
I
live
in
continual
alarm
,
and
provide
myself
with
a
speaking
-
trumpet
,
which
stand
by
my
bed
side
,
to
be
use
in
call
for
assistance
,
in
case
my
pursuer
should
make
an
attack
upon
my
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
this
situation
be
extremely
uncomfortable
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
begin
my
process
against
him
,
than
I
put
myself
intirely
under
the
protection
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
conduct
me
to
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
who
live
in
the
country
,
where
I
be
secure
from
the
attempt
of
my
husband
.
    
<EOS>
the
world
have
now
give
me
up
,
and
I
have
renounce
the
world
with
the
most
perfect
resignation
.
<EOS>
I
weigh
in
my
own
breast
what
I
should
lose
in
point
of
character
,
with
what
I
suffer
in
my
peace
at
home
,
and
find
,
that
my
reputation
be
not
to
be
preserve
,
except
at
the
expence
of
my
quiet
,
(
for
his
lordship
be
not
dispose
to
make
me
easy
,
have
I
be
never
so
discreet
.
)
<EOS>
I
therefore
determine
to
give
up
a
few
ceremonial
visit
,
and
empty
profession
,
for
the
more
substantial
enjoyment
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
We
pass
our
time
very
agreeably
,
in
various
amusement
,
with
this
friend
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
until
the
term
of
my
reckoning
be
almost
expire
,
then
return
to
London
,
and
take
lodging
in
Southampton
-
street
,
where
I
begin
to
make
preparation
for
the
approach
occasion
.
<EOS>
here
I
propose
to
live
with
the
utmost
circumspection
.
<EOS>
I
disguise
my
name
,
see
nobody
but
my
lawyer
and
lover
,
and
never
approach
the
window
,
lest
I
should
be
discover
by
accident
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
precaution
,
my
french
maid
,
whom
I
have
send
for
some
of
my
cloath
,
be
dog
in
her
return
,
and
next
morning
my
lord
take
my
lodging
by
storm
.
<EOS>
have
he
give
the
assault
in
his
own
person
only
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
he
would
have
suffer
a
repulse
,
from
the
opposition
of
the
Ligeoise
,
who
make
all
the
resistance
in
her
power
,
but
be
oblige
to
give
way
to
superior
number
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
at
that
time
abed
,
and
hear
an
unusual
noise
below
,
rung
my
bell
,
in
order
to
know
the
cause
of
such
disturbance
.
<EOS>
I
draw
my
curtain
at
the
same
time
,
and
who
should
I
see
enter
my
chamber
but
his
lordship
,
attend
by
a
constable
,
and
the
footman
who
have
detect
my
retreat
!
    
<EOS>
such
an
unexpected
visit
could
not
fail
to
affect
me
with
surprize
and
consternation
:
however
,
I
summon
all
my
fortitude
to
my
aid
,
and
perceive
the
fellow
be
about
to
open
my
window
-
shutter
,
desire
their
principal
to
order
them
down
stair
.
<EOS>
He
readily
comply
with
my
request
,
and
sit
down
by
my
bed
-
side
,
tell
me
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
that
he
have
find
me
at
last
;
and
I
frankly
own
,
that
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
his
success
.
<EOS>
instead
of
upbraid
me
with
my
escape
,
he
proceed
to
entertain
me
with
all
the
news
in
town
,
and
give
me
a
minute
detail
of
every
thing
which
have
happen
to
him
since
our
parting
;
among
other
article
of
intelligence
,
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
have
challenge
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
refuse
to
fight
him
,
and
be
in
disgrace
with
the
prince
of
W
#
#
#
#
on
that
account
.
    
<EOS>
but
here
his
lordship
do
not
strictly
adhere
to
the
naked
truth
:
he
have
indeed
,
before
our
departure
for
the
country
,
go
to
my
lover
,
and
insist
upon
have
satisfaction
in
Hyde
-
park
,
two
day
from
the
date
of
his
demand
,
and
at
three
o
'
clock
in
the
afternoon
;
S
#
#
#
#
believe
him
in
earnest
,
accept
the
invitation
;
though
he
observe
,
that
these
affair
could
not
be
discuss
too
soon
,
and
wish
the
time
of
meeting
may
be
at
an
early
hour
.
    
<EOS>
but
his
lordship
do
not
choose
to
alter
the
circumstance
of
his
first
proposal
;
and
when
he
go
away
,
say
he
should
expect
him
at
the
appoint
time
and
place
,
if
it
do
not
rain
.
    
<EOS>
His
antagonist
give
me
an
account
of
the
conversation
,
when
I
assure
him
the
whole
business
would
end
in
smoke
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
my
lord
send
him
a
letter
on
Monday
,
desire
that
the
assignation
may
be
defer
till
Thursday
,
that
he
may
have
time
to
settle
his
affair
,
and
pay
S
#
#
#
#
an
hundred
pound
,
which
he
have
formerly
borrow
of
him
.
<EOS>
when
Thursday
come
,
he
be
favour
with
another
epistle
,
import
,
that
the
challenger
have
change
his
mind
,
and
would
seek
satisfaction
at
law
.
<EOS>
thus
end
that
heroic
exploit
,
which
his
lordship
now
boast
of
with
such
arrogant
misrepresentation
.
    
<EOS>
Whilst
he
regale
me
with
these
interesting
particular
,
I
be
contrive
a
scheme
to
frustrate
the
discovery
he
have
make
;
so
that
I
do
not
contradict
his
assertion
,
but
tell
him
,
that
if
he
would
go
down
stair
,
I
would
rise
and
come
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
consent
to
this
proposal
with
great
chearfulness
;
and
I
own
,
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
to
find
him
,
at
this
first
interview
,
in
as
good
humour
,
as
if
nothing
have
happen
to
interrupt
the
felicity
of
our
matrimonial
union
.
    
<EOS>
It
cost
me
some
invention
to
conceal
my
condition
from
his
notice
,
be
now
within
a
week
of
the
expected
crisis
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
I
have
to
do
with
a
man
of
no
great
penetration
,
and
succeed
in
my
attempt
accordingly
.
<EOS>
We
breakfast
with
great
harmony
,
and
I
invite
him
to
dinner
,
after
have
prevail
upon
him
to
send
away
his
myrmidon
,
whom
,
nevertheless
,
he
order
to
return
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
We
converse
together
with
great
gaiety
and
mirth
;
and
when
I
rally
him
for
visit
me
in
such
a
dishabille
,
he
stand
a
tiptoe
to
view
himself
in
the
glass
;
and
own
I
be
in
the
right
,
say
he
would
go
and
dress
himself
before
dinner
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
go
away
,
charge
my
maid
to
give
him
entrance
at
his
return
;
and
he
be
no
sooner
go
than
I
write
to
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
give
him
an
account
of
what
have
happen
;
then
,
without
have
determine
upon
any
certain
plan
,
huddle
on
my
cloath
,
muffle
myself
up
,
and
call
a
chair
,
go
to
the
next
tavern
,
where
I
stay
no
longer
than
be
sufficient
to
change
my
vehicle
;
and
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
drawer
,
who
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
my
perturbation
,
proceed
to
a
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
I
dismiss
my
second
chair
,
and
procure
an
hackney
coach
,
in
which
I
repair
to
the
lodging
of
my
lawyer
,
whom
I
could
trust
.
<EOS>
have
make
him
acquaint
with
the
circumstance
of
my
distress
,
and
consult
him
about
a
proper
place
of
retreat
,
after
some
recollection
he
direct
me
to
a
little
house
in
a
court
,
to
which
,
by
the
assistance
,
of
my
lover
,
my
woman
and
cloath
be
safely
convey
that
same
evening
.
    
<EOS>
My
lord
,
however
,
come
to
dinner
,
accord
to
invitation
,
and
do
not
seem
at
all
alarm
when
my
maid
tell
him
I
be
go
,
but
step
to
my
lawyer
,
to
know
if
he
think
I
should
return
;
and
upon
his
answering
in
the
affirmative
,
and
advise
his
lordship
to
go
back
in
the
mean
time
,
and
eat
the
dinner
I
have
provide
,
he
very
deliberately
take
his
advice
,
make
a
very
hearty
meal
,
drink
his
bottle
of
wine
,
and
,
as
I
do
not
return
,
accord
to
his
expectation
,
withdraw
,
in
order
to
consult
his
associate
.
    
<EOS>
this
motion
of
his
furnish
my
woman
with
an
opportunity
of
make
her
retreat
;
and
when
he
return
at
night
,
the
coast
be
clear
,
and
he
find
no
body
in
the
house
but
a
porter
,
who
have
be
leave
to
take
care
of
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
enraged
at
this
disappointment
,
that
he
make
a
furious
noise
,
which
raise
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
reinforce
his
crew
with
the
authority
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
tarry
in
the
street
till
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
discharge
a
lodging
he
have
hire
at
a
barber
's
shop
,
opposite
to
the
house
from
which
I
have
escape
,
and
retire
with
the
comfortable
reflexion
of
have
do
every
thing
which
man
could
do
to
retrieve
me
.
    
<EOS>
the
hurry
of
spirit
,
and
surprize
I
have
undergo
in
effect
this
retreat
,
produce
such
a
disorder
in
my
constitution
,
that
I
begin
to
fear
I
should
be
deliver
before
I
could
be
provide
with
necessary
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
signify
my
apprehension
to
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
with
infinite
care
and
concern
endeavour
to
find
a
more
convenient
place
;
and
,
after
all
his
inquiry
,
be
oblige
to
fix
upon
a
paultry
apartment
in
the
city
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
tenderness
be
extremely
shocked
at
the
necessity
of
choose
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
remedy
,
nor
time
to
be
lose
:
to
this
miserable
habitation
I
be
carry
in
an
hackney
coach
;
and
,
tho
'
extremely
ill
,
bore
my
fate
with
spirit
and
resignation
,
in
testimony
of
my
sincere
and
indelible
attachment
to
my
lover
,
for
whose
ease
and
pleasure
I
could
have
suffer
every
inconvenience
,
and
even
sacrifice
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
immediately
after
I
have
take
possession
of
my
wretched
apartment
,
I
be
constrain
by
my
indisposition
to
go
to
bed
,
and
send
for
the
necessary
help
;
and
in
a
few
hour
a
live
pledge
of
my
love
and
indiscretion
see
the
light
,
tho
'
the
terror
and
fatigue
<EOS>
I
have
undergo
have
affect
this
little
innocent
so
severely
,
that
it
scarce
discover
any
visible
sign
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
My
grief
at
this
misfortune
be
inexpressible
:
I
forthwith
dispatch
a
message
to
the
dear
,
the
anxious
father
,
who
fly
to
my
arm
,
and
share
my
sorrow
,
with
all
the
gentleness
of
love
and
parental
fondness
;
yet
our
fear
be
happily
disappoint
by
the
recovery
of
our
infant
daughter
,
who
be
commit
to
the
charge
of
a
nurse
in
the
neighbourhood
;
so
that
I
could
every
day
be
satisfied
in
my
inquiry
about
her
health
.
<EOS>
thus
I
continue
a
whole
fortnight
,
in
a
state
of
happiness
and
tranquillity
,
be
bless
with
the
conversation
and
tender
office
of
my
admirer
,
whose
love
and
attention
I
wholly
ingrosse
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
give
up
all
business
and
amusement
,
and
concentre
all
his
care
and
assiduity
in
ministre
to
my
ease
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
and
sure
I
have
no
cause
to
regret
what
I
have
suffer
on
his
account
.
    
<EOS>
but
this
my
agreeable
situation
be
one
day
disturb
by
a
most
alarming
accident
,
by
which
my
life
be
draw
into
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
the
room
under
my
bed
-
chamber
take
fire
;
I
immediately
smell
it
,
and
see
the
people
about
me
in
the
utmost
perplexity
and
consternation
,
tho
'
they
would
not
own
the
true
cause
of
their
confusion
,
lest
my
health
should
suffer
in
the
fright
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
I
be
so
calm
in
my
inquiry
,
that
they
venture
to
tell
me
my
suspicion
be
but
<EOS>
too
just
:
upon
which
I
give
such
direction
as
I
think
would
secure
me
from
catch
cold
,
in
case
there
should
be
a
necessity
for
remove
me
;
but
the
fire
be
happily
extinguish
,
I
escape
that
ceremony
,
which
may
have
cost
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
surprising
,
that
the
agitation
of
my
spirit
do
not
produce
some
fatal
effect
upon
my
constitution
;
and
I
look
upon
my
deliverance
as
the
protection
of
a
particular
providence
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
I
escape
the
hazard
of
a
sudden
removal
,
I
find
it
be
high
time
to
change
my
lodging
,
because
the
neighbour
rush
into
the
house
,
upon
the
alarm
of
fire
,
have
discover
my
situation
,
though
they
be
ignorant
of
my
name
;
and
I
do
not
think
myself
safe
,
in
be
the
subject
of
their
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
therefore
procure
another
apartment
,
with
well
accommodation
,
to
which
I
be
carry
,
as
soon
as
my
health
would
admit
of
my
removal
;
and
soon
after
my
lord
write
to
me
,
by
the
hand
of
my
lawyer
,
earnestly
intreate
me
to
drop
my
prosecution
,
and
come
home
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
comply
with
his
request
;
and
nothing
be
farth
from
my
intention
than
the
desire
of
receive
any
favour
at
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
thus
repulse
,
he
set
on
foot
a
most
accurate
search
for
my
person
;
in
the
course
of
which
he
be
say
to
have
detect
several
lady
and
young
girl
,
who
have
reason
for
keep
themselves
conceal
;
and
have
like
to
have
be
very
severely
handle
for
his
impertinent
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
be
unsuccessful
in
all
his
attempt
,
he
enter
into
treaty
with
one
Sir
R
#
#
#
#
h
#
#
#
#
,
a
person
of
a
very
indifferent
character
,
who
undertake
to
furnish
him
with
an
infallible
expedient
to
discover
the
place
of
my
abode
,
if
he
would
gratify
him
with
a
bond
for
a
thousand
pound
;
which
be
execute
accordingly
,
this
worthy
knight
advertise
me
and
my
maid
in
the
public
paper
,
offer
one
hundred
pound
as
a
reward
to
any
person
who
should
disclose
the
place
of
our
retirement
.
    
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
paper
fall
into
my
hand
I
be
again
involve
in
perplexity
;
and
be
afraid
of
stay
in
town
,
resolve
,
with
the
concurrence
of
my
lover
,
to
accept
of
an
invitation
I
have
receive
from
the
duke
of
K
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
by
this
time
arrive
in
England
,
with
that
lady
whom
I
have
already
mention
,
as
one
of
our
party
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
have
visit
my
little
infant
,
I
next
day
set
out
for
the
duke
's
country
-
seat
,
which
be
a
most
elegant
chateau
,
and
stand
in
a
charming
situation
:
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
follow
in
a
few
day
;
we
meet
with
a
very
cordial
reception
;
his
grace
be
civil
and
good
-
natured
,
live
nobly
and
love
pleasure
;
Madam
la
T
#
#
#
#
be
form
to
please
:
there
be
always
a
great
deal
of
good
company
in
the
house
;
so
that
we
pass
our
time
agreeably
in
play
at
billiard
and
card
,
hunting
,
walking
,
reading
and
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
but
my
term
of
happiness
be
generally
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
felicity
I
be
overtake
by
a
most
severe
affliction
,
in
the
death
of
my
dear
hapless
infant
,
who
have
ingrosse
a
great
share
of
my
tenderness
than
perhaps
I
even
should
have
pay
to
the
offspring
of
a
legitimate
contract
,
because
the
circumstance
of
her
birth
would
have
be
an
unsurmountable
misfortune
to
her
thro
'
the
whole
course
of
her
life
,
and
render
her
absolutely
dependent
on
my
love
and
protection
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
still
lament
the
untimely
fate
of
this
fair
blossom
,
lord
   
come
down
,
and
demand
me
as
his
wife
;
but
the
suit
which
I
then
maintain
against
him
deprive
him
,
for
the
present
,
of
an
husband
's
right
;
and
therefore
the
duke
would
not
deliver
me
into
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
in
six
month
he
repeat
his
visit
and
demand
;
and
an
agreement
be
patch
up
,
in
consequence
of
which
I
consent
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
,
on
condition
that
he
should
never
desire
to
sleep
with
me
,
or
take
any
other
measure
to
disturb
my
peace
;
otherwise
I
should
be
at
liberty
to
leave
him
again
,
and
intitle
to
the
provision
of
a
separate
maintenance
.
<EOS>
to
these
article
I
assent
,
by
the
advice
of
my
lawyer
,
with
a
view
of
obtain
the
payment
of
my
pin
-
money
,
which
I
have
never
receive
since
our
parting
,
but
subsist
on
the
sale
of
my
jewel
,
which
be
very
considerable
,
and
have
be
present
to
me
with
full
power
of
alienation
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
lover
,
he
have
no
fortune
to
support
me
;
and
for
that
reason
I
be
scrupulously
cautious
of
augment
his
expence
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
now
enjoy
each
other
's
company
for
three
year
,
during
which
our
mutual
passion
have
suffer
no
abatement
,
nor
have
my
happiness
be
mix
with
any
considerable
allay
,
except
that
late
stroke
of
providence
which
I
have
already
mention
,
and
the
reflexion
of
the
sorrow
that
my
conduct
have
intaile
upon
my
dear
father
,
whom
I
love
beyond
expression
,
and
whom
nothing
could
have
compel
me
to
disoblige
but
a
more
powerful
flame
,
that
prevail
over
every
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
now
force
to
break
off
this
inchante
correspondence
,
it
be
not
to
be
doubt
that
our
parting
cost
us
the
most
acute
sensation
of
grief
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
remedy
:
    
I
tear
myself
from
his
arm
,
take
my
leave
of
the
family
,
after
have
acknowledge
my
obligation
to
the
duke
,
and
set
out
for
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
I
be
meet
by
my
lord
,
attend
by
a
steward
whom
he
have
lately
engage
,
and
who
be
one
chief
cause
of
our
future
separation
.
<EOS>
My
lord
have
quit
his
house
in
town
,
conduct
me
to
his
lodging
in
Pall
-
Mall
,
and
insist
upon
sleep
with
me
the
first
night
;
but
I
refuse
to
gratify
his
desire
,
on
the
authority
of
our
agreement
.
    
<EOS>
this
dispute
produce
a
quarrel
,
in
consequence
of
which
I
attempt
to
leave
the
house
;
and
he
endeavour
to
prevent
my
retreat
,
I
fairly
lock
him
in
,
run
down
stair
,
and
call
a
hackney
coach
,
make
the
good
of
my
way
into
the
city
,
to
my
father
's
lodging
,
where
I
lay
,
the
family
be
in
town
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
himself
be
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
him
immediately
,
and
when
he
come
to
London
,
declare
my
intention
of
separate
from
my
lord
,
with
which
,
see
me
obstinate
and
determine
,
he
at
length
acquiesce
,
and
a
formal
separation
accordingly
ensue
,
which
at
that
time
I
think
binding
and
immutable
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
now
shelter
under
the
wing
of
an
indulgent
father
,
who
have
take
me
into
favour
again
,
on
the
supposition
that
my
commerce
with
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
be
absolutely
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
tho
'
we
have
separate
,
in
all
appearance
,
for
ever
,
we
have
previously
agree
to
maintain
our
correspondence
in
private
interview
,
which
should
escape
the
notice
of
the
world
,
with
which
I
be
again
oblige
to
keep
some
measure
.
    
<EOS>
Our
parting
at
the
duke
of
K
#
#
#
#
's
house
in
the
country
be
attend
with
all
the
genuine
mark
of
sincere
and
reciprocal
affection
,
and
I
live
in
the
sweet
hope
of
see
him
again
,
in
all
the
transport
of
his
former
passion
,
when
my
lawyer
,
who
receive
my
letter
,
bring
me
a
billet
one
night
,
just
as
I
have
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
see
the
superscription
of
s
#
#
#
#
's
hand
-
writing
,
I
open
it
with
all
the
impatience
of
an
absent
lover
;
but
how
shall
I
describe
the
astonishment
and
consternation
with
which
I
be
seize
,
when
I
peruse
the
content
!
<EOS>
instead
of
the
most
tender
vow
and
protestation
,
this
fatal
epistle
begin
with
,
Madam
,
the
good
thing
you
can
do
be
to
return
to
your
father
;
or
some
cold
and
kill
expression
,
to
that
effect
.
    
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
feel
at
this
dire
conjuncture
!
<EOS>
the
light
forsook
my
eye
,
a
cold
sweat
bedew
my
limb
,
and
I
be
overwhelmed
with
such
a
torrent
of
sorrow
and
surprize
,
that
every
body
present
believe
I
would
have
die
under
the
violent
agitation
.
<EOS>
They
endeavour
to
support
my
spirit
with
repeat
draught
of
strong
liquor
,
which
have
no
sensible
effect
upon
my
constitution
,
tho
'
for
eight
whole
year
<EOS>
I
have
drink
nothing
strong
than
water
;
and
I
must
have
infallibly
perish
in
the
first
extasy
of
my
grief
,
have
it
not
make
its
way
in
a
fit
of
tear
and
exclamation
,
in
which
I
continue
all
night
,
to
the
amazement
of
the
family
,
whom
my
condition
have
alarm
,
and
raise
from
their
repose
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
the
only
person
who
guess
the
cause
of
my
affliction
;
he
say
he
be
sure
I
have
receive
some
ill
usage
in
a
letter
or
message
from
that
rascal
S
#
#
#
#
(
so
he
term
him
in
the
bitterness
of
passion
)
.
    
<EOS>
at
mention
of
that
name
my
agony
redouble
to
such
a
degree
,
that
all
who
be
present
weep
at
sight
of
my
deplorable
condition
.
    
<EOS>
My
poor
father
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
conjure
me
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
my
disquiet
:
upon
which
,
rather
than
confess
the
truth
,
I
amuse
his
concern
,
by
pretend
that
my
lover
be
ill
.
<EOS>
the
whole
family
have
stay
by
me
till
I
be
a
little
more
composed
,
leave
me
to
the
care
of
my
maid
,
who
put
me
into
bed
about
six
in
the
morning
;
but
I
enjoy
no
rest
<EOS>
:
I
revolve
every
circumstance
of
my
conduct
,
endeavour
to
find
out
the
cause
of
this
fatal
change
in
S
#
#
#
#
's
disposition
;
and
as
I
could
recollect
nothing
which
could
justly
give
offence
,
conclude
that
some
malicious
person
have
abuse
his
ear
with
story
to
my
prejudice
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
conjecture
I
get
up
,
and
send
my
lawyer
to
him
with
a
letter
,
wherein
I
insist
upon
see
him
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
justify
myself
in
person
;
a
task
which
would
be
easily
perform
,
as
I
have
never
offend
,
but
in
love
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
wait
with
the
most
anxious
impatience
for
the
return
of
my
messenger
,
who
bring
me
an
answer
couch
in
the
cold
term
of
civility
which
indifference
could
dictate
;
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
he
have
nothing
to
lay
to
my
charge
,
but
that
it
be
for
the
good
of
us
both
we
should
part
.
  
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
reflect
on
that
before
,
not
after
I
have
sacrifice
my
all
for
his
love
!
<EOS>
I
be
well
nigh
distract
by
this
confirmation
of
his
inconstancy
;
and
I
wonder
to
this
day
how
I
retain
the
use
of
reason
,
under
such
circumstance
of
horror
and
despair
!
<EOS>
My
grief
lay
aside
all
decorum
and
restraint
;
I
tell
my
father
that
S
#
#
#
#
be
die
,
and
that
I
would
visit
him
with
all
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Startled
at
the
proposal
,
this
careful
parent
demonstrate
the
fatal
consequence
of
such
an
unguarded
step
,
remind
me
of
the
difficulty
with
which
he
have
prevail
upon
my
mother
and
uncle
to
forgive
my
former
imprudence
,
observe
that
his
intention
be
to
carry
me
into
the
country
next
day
,
in
order
to
effect
a
perfect
reconciliation
;
but
now
I
be
on
the
brink
of
forfeit
all
pretension
to
their
regard
,
by
commit
another
fatal
error
,
which
could
not
possibly
be
retrieve
;
and
that
for
his
part
,
whatever
pang
it
may
cost
him
,
he
be
resolve
to
banish
me
from
his
sight
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
utter
this
declaration
the
tear
trickle
down
his
cheek
,
and
he
seem
overwhelmed
with
the
keen
sorrow
and
mortification
;
so
it
may
be
easily
conceive
what
be
the
impression
of
my
grief
,
reinforce
with
the
affliction
of
a
father
whom
I
dearly
love
,
and
the
consciousness
of
be
the
cause
of
all
his
disquiet
!
<EOS>
I
be
strike
dumb
with
remorse
and
woe
;
and
when
I
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
I
tell
him
how
sensible
I
be
of
his
great
goodness
and
humanity
,
and
own
how
little
I
deserve
his
favour
and
affection
;
that
the
sense
of
my
own
unworthiness
be
one
cause
of
my
present
distraction
;
for
such
be
the
condition
of
my
fate
,
that
I
must
either
see
S
#
#
#
#
or
die
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
tho
<EOS>
'
I
could
not
expect
his
forgiveness
,
I
be
surely
worthy
of
his
compassion
;
that
nothing
but
the
most
irresistible
passion
could
have
mislead
me
at
first
from
my
duty
,
or
tempt
me
to
incur
the
least
degree
of
his
displeasure
;
that
the
same
fatal
influence
still
prevail
,
and
would
,
in
all
probability
,
continue
to
the
grave
,
which
be
the
only
abode
in
which
I
hope
for
peace
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
express
myself
in
this
manner
,
my
dear
good
father
weep
with
the
most
tender
sympathy
,
and
say
I
may
do
as
I
please
,
for
he
have
do
with
me
,
quit
the
room
,
leave
me
to
the
cruel
sensation
of
my
own
heart
,
which
almost
burst
with
anguish
,
upbraid
me
with
a
fault
which
I
could
not
help
commit
.
    
<EOS>
I
immediately
hire
a
chariot
and
six
,
and
would
have
set
out
by
myself
,
have
not
my
father
's
affection
,
which
all
my
error
could
not
efface
,
provide
an
attendant
.
<EOS>
He
see
me
quite
delirious
and
desperate
;
and
therefore
engage
a
relation
of
my
own
to
accompany
and
take
care
of
me
in
this
rash
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
during
this
journey
,
which
last
two
day
,
I
feel
no
remission
of
grief
and
anxiety
,
but
undergo
the
most
intolerable
sorrow
and
suspense
:
at
last
we
arrive
at
a
little
house
call
the
Hut
,
on
Salisbury
<EOS>
plain
,
where
,
in
the
most
frantic
agitation
,
I
write
a
letter
to
S
#
#
#
#
,
describe
the
miserable
condition
to
which
I
be
reduce
by
his
unkindness
,
and
desire
to
see
him
,
with
the
most
earnest
sollicitation
.
    
<EOS>
this
billet
I
commit
to
the
care
of
my
attendant
,
and
lay
strong
injunction
upon
him
to
tell
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
my
injury
be
so
great
,
and
my
despair
so
violent
,
that
if
he
do
not
favour
me
with
a
visit
,
I
would
go
to
him
,
though
at
his
sister
's
house
,
where
he
then
be
.
    
<EOS>
He
receive
my
message
with
great
coldness
,
and
tell
my
friend
,
that
if
I
would
return
to
London
,
without
insist
upon
the
interview
I
demand
,
he
would
in
a
little
time
follow
me
to
town
,
and
every
thing
should
be
amicably
adjust
.
    
<EOS>
but
when
the
messenger
assure
him
,
that
I
be
too
much
transport
with
grief
,
to
hear
of
such
a
proposal
,
he
consent
to
meet
me
in
the
middle
of
salisbury
-
plain
,
that
we
may
avoid
all
observation
:
and
though
I
be
little
able
to
walk
,
I
set
out
on
foot
for
the
place
of
assignation
,
<EOS>
my
companion
follow
at
a
small
distance
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
see
him
lead
his
horse
down
the
hill
,
I
collect
all
my
fortitude
,
and
advanced
to
him
with
all
the
speed
I
could
exert
;
but
when
I
make
an
effort
to
speak
,
my
tongue
deny
its
office
;
and
so
lively
be
the
expression
of
unutterable
sorrow
in
my
countenance
,
<EOS>
that
his
heart
(
hard
as
it
be
)
melt
at
sight
of
my
suffering
,
which
he
well
know
proceed
from
the
sincerity
of
my
love
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
enough
to
tell
him
,
that
I
be
come
to
take
my
leave
;
and
when
I
would
have
proceed
,
my
voice
fail
me
again
:
but
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
I
find
mean
,
with
great
difficulty
,
to
let
him
know
how
sensible
I
be
of
my
own
incapacity
to
retrieve
his
lost
affection
;
but
that
I
be
willing
(
if
possible
)
to
retain
his
esteem
,
of
which
,
could
I
be
assure
,
I
would
endeavour
to
compose
myself
;
that
I
be
determined
to
leave
the
kingdom
,
because
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
those
place
where
we
have
be
so
happy
in
our
mutual
love
;
and
that
,
till
my
departure
,
I
hope
he
would
visit
me
sometimes
,
that
I
may
,
by
degree
,
wean
myself
from
his
company
;
for
,
I
should
not
be
able
to
survive
the
shock
of
be
deprive
of
him
all
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
this
address
may
seem
very
humble
to
an
unconcerned
observer
;
but
love
will
tame
the
proud
disposition
,
as
plainly
appear
in
my
case
;
for
I
have
naturally
as
much
spirit
,
or
more
,
than
the
generality
of
people
have
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
be
so
much
confound
at
the
manner
of
my
behaviour
,
that
he
scarce
know
what
answer
to
make
;
for
(
as
he
afterwards
own
)
he
expect
to
hear
himself
upbraided
;
but
he
be
not
proof
against
my
tenderness
.
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
he
say
he
never
mean
to
forsake
me
intirely
,
that
his
affection
be
still
unimpaired
,
and
that
he
would
follow
me
directly
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
impose
upon
myself
,
and
believe
what
he
say
,
because
I
could
not
bear
to
think
of
part
with
him
for
ever
,
and
return
to
town
in
a
more
tranquil
state
of
mind
than
that
in
which
I
have
leave
my
father
,
though
my
heart
be
far
from
be
at
ease
;
my
fear
be
ingenious
enough
to
foresee
,
that
I
should
never
be
able
to
overcome
his
indifference
.
    
<EOS>
I
take
lodging
in
Mount
-
street
,
and
my
maid
have
dispose
of
herself
in
marriage
,
hire
another
,
who
supply
her
place
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
;
she
be
a
good
girl
,
have
a
particular
attachment
to
me
,
and
for
many
year
,
during
which
she
live
in
my
service
,
be
indefatigably
assiduous
in
contribute
to
my
ease
,
or
rather
,
in
alleviate
my
affliction
:
for
,
though
S
#
#
#
#
come
up
to
town
accord
to
promise
,
and
renew
a
sort
of
correspondence
with
me
for
the
space
of
five
month
,
his
complaisance
would
extend
no
farther
;
and
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
have
determine
to
go
abroad
with
Mr
V
#
#
#
#
,
whom
he
accordingly
accompany
in
his
envoyship
to
d####n
.
    
<EOS>
I
understand
the
real
cause
of
this
expedition
,
which
,
notwithstanding
his
oath
and
protestation
of
unabated
love
and
regard
,
I
construe
into
a
palpable
mark
of
dislike
and
disrespect
;
not
could
the
repeat
assurance
I
receive
from
him
in
letter
,
mitigate
the
anguish
and
mortification
that
prey
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
give
up
all
hope
of
recover
the
happiness
I
have
lose
:
I
tell
him
,
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
,
that
he
may
exercise
his
gallantry
a
great
while
,
before
he
would
meet
with
my
fellow
,
in
point
of
sincerity
and
love
;
for
I
would
rather
have
be
a
servant
in
his
house
,
with
the
privilege
of
see
him
,
than
the
queen
of
England
,
debar
of
that
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
take
his
leave
,
and
go
down
stair
,
I
shrink
at
every
step
he
make
,
as
if
a
new
wound
have
be
inflict
upon
me
;
and
when
I
hear
the
door
shut
behind
him
,
my
heart
die
within
me
.
<EOS>
(
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
hear
afterwards
<EOS>
,
he
lament
the
loss
of
me
prodigiously
,
and
that
he
have
never
be
so
happy
since
.
)
<EOS>
I
sit
down
to
write
a
letter
,
in
which
I
forgave
his
indifference
,
because
I
know
the
affection
be
altogether
involuntary
,
and
wish
him
all
the
happiness
he
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
then
walk
up
and
down
the
room
in
the
most
restless
anxiety
,
be
put
to
bed
by
my
maid
,
rise
at
six
,
mount
my
horse
,
and
ride
forty
mile
,
in
order
to
fatigue
myself
,
that
I
may
,
next
night
,
enjoy
some
repose
.
<EOS>
this
exercise
I
daily
undergo
for
month
together
;
and
when
it
do
not
answer
my
purpose
,
I
use
to
walk
round
Hydepark
in
the
evening
,
when
the
place
be
quite
solitary
,
and
unvisited
by
any
other
human
creature
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
melancholy
perambulation
,
I
be
one
day
accost
by
a
very
great
man
,
who
,
after
the
first
salutation
,
ask
whether
or
not
my
intercourse
with
S
#
#
#
#
be
at
an
end
;
and
if
I
have
any
allowance
from
my
husband
?
    
<EOS>
to
the
first
of
these
question
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
;
and
to
the
last
answer
,
that
my
lord
do
not
allow
me
a
great
deal
;
indeed
I
may
have
truly
say
,
nothing
at
all
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
proud
to
own
my
indigence
.
<EOS>
He
then
express
his
wonder
,
how
one
like
me
,
who
have
be
use
to
splendor
and
affluence
from
my
cradle
,
could
make
shift
to
live
in
my
present
narrow
circumstance
;
and
when
I
tell
him
that
I
could
make
a
very
good
shift
,
so
I
have
peace
,
he
seem
to
lament
my
situation
,
and
very
kindly
invite
me
to
sup
with
his
wife
,
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
invitation
,
without
any
apprehension
of
the
consequence
;
and
when
I
go
to
the
place
,
be
introduce
into
an
apartment
,
magnificently
light
up
(
I
suppose
)
for
my
reception
.
    
<EOS>
after
I
have
stay
alone
for
some
time
in
this
mysterious
situation
,
without
see
a
live
soul
,
my
inviter
appear
,
and
say
,
he
hope
I
would
not
take
it
amiss
,
that
he
and
I
be
to
sup
by
ourselves
,
as
he
have
something
to
say
,
which
could
not
be
so
properly
communicate
before
company
or
servant
.
<EOS>
I
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
perceive
his
drift
,
to
my
no
small
surprize
and
indignation
;
and
with
evident
mark
of
displeasure
tell
him
,
I
be
sure
he
have
nothing
to
propose
that
would
be
agreeable
to
my
inclination
,
and
that
I
would
immediately
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
I
could
not
possibly
retire
,
because
he
have
send
away
my
chair
,
and
all
his
servant
be
dispose
to
obey
his
order
.
    
<EOS>
Incensed
at
this
declaration
,
which
I
consider
as
an
insult
,
I
answer
with
an
air
of
resolution
,
it
be
very
well
;
I
despise
his
contrivance
,
and
be
afraid
of
nobody
.
<EOS>
see
me
,
thus
alarm
,
he
assure
me
I
have
no
reason
to
be
afraid
;
that
he
have
love
me
long
,
and
could
find
no
other
opportunity
of
declare
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
Q
#
#
#
#
have
tell
him
,
that
lord
C
#
#
#
#
have
renew
his
address
to
me
;
and
as
he
understand
from
my
own
mouth
,
my
correspondence
with
S
#
#
#
#
be
absolutely
break
off
,
he
think
himself
as
well
intitle
as
another
to
my
regard
.
<EOS>
in
conclusion
,
he
tell
me
,
that
I
may
command
his
purse
,
and
that
he
have
power
enough
to
bring
me
into
the
world
again
with
eclat
.
<EOS>
to
these
advance
I
reply
,
that
he
be
very
much
mistake
in
his
opinion
of
my
character
,
if
he
imagine
I
be
to
be
win
by
any
temptation
of
fortune
,
and
very
frankly
declare
,
that
I
would
rather
give
myself
to
a
footman
,
than
sell
myself
to
a
prince
.
    
<EOS>
Supper
be
serve
,
we
sit
down
together
;
but
I
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
any
thing
,
except
a
little
bread
and
water
;
for
I
be
an
odd
whimsical
girl
;
and
it
come
into
my
head
,
that
he
may
,
perhaps
,
have
mix
something
in
the
victual
or
wine
,
which
would
alter
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
find
himself
baffle
in
all
his
endeavour
,
he
permit
me
,
about
twelve
o'clock
,
to
depart
in
peace
,
and
give
up
his
suit
,
as
a
desperate
cause
.
    
<EOS>
this
uncomfortable
life
do
I
lead
for
a
whole
twelvemonth
,
without
feel
the
least
abatement
of
my
melancholy
;
and
find
myself
worn
to
a
skeleton
,
I
resume
my
former
resolution
of
try
to
profit
by
change
of
place
,
and
actually
go
abroad
with
no
other
attendant
but
my
woman
,
and
the
utmost
indifference
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
My
intention
be
to
have
go
to
the
South
of
France
,
where
I
think
I
could
have
subsist
on
the
little
I
have
leave
,
which
amount
to
five
hundred
pound
,
until
the
issue
of
my
law
-
suit
,
by
which
I
hope
to
obtain
some
provision
from
my
lord
;
and
,
without
all
doubt
,
my
expectation
would
have
be
answer
,
have
I
put
this
my
plan
in
execution
:
but
be
at
Paris
,
<EOS>
from
whence
I
purpose
to
set
forward
in
a
few
day
,
I
send
to
Mr
K
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
be
formerly
intimate
with
my
father
,
and
shew
me
many
civility
during
my
first
residence
in
France
.
    
<EOS>
this
gentleman
favour
me
with
a
visit
,
and
when
I
make
him
acquainted
with
my
scheme
,
dissuade
me
from
it
,
as
an
uncomfortable
determination
,
and
advise
me
to
stay
at
Paris
,
where
,
with
good
oeconomy
,
I
could
live
as
cheap
as
in
any
other
place
,
and
enjoy
the
conversation
and
countenance
of
my
friend
,
among
which
number
he
declare
himself
one
of
the
most
faithful
;
assure
me
,
that
I
should
be
always
welcome
to
his
table
,
and
want
for
nothing
;
and
promise
to
recommend
me
as
a
lodger
to
a
friend
of
his
,
with
whom
I
would
live
in
a
frugal
and
decent
manner
;
and
that
,
as
the
woman
be
well
know
and
esteem
by
all
the
english
company
in
Paris
,
it
would
be
the
most
reputable
step
I
could
take
,
(
<EOS>
consider
my
youth
and
situation
)
to
lodge
with
a
creditable
person
,
who
could
answer
for
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
thus
persuade
,
I
very
simply
follow
his
advice
;
I
say
simply
,
because
,
notwithstanding
his
representation
,
I
soon
find
my
money
melt
away
,
without
any
prospect
of
a
fresh
supply
.
    
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
this
,
however
,
I
pass
my
time
very
agreeably
in
several
English
,
and
some
french
family
,
where
,
in
a
little
time
,
I
become
quite
intimate
,
see
a
great
deal
of
company
,
and
be
treat
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
regard
;
yet
,
in
the
midst
of
these
pleasure
,
many
a
melancholy
sigh
would
rise
at
the
remembrance
of
my
beloved
S
#
#
#
#
,
whom
for
several
year
I
could
not
recollect
without
emotion
;
but
time
,
company
,
amusement
,
and
change
of
place
,
in
a
great
measure
dissipate
these
idea
,
and
enable
me
to
bear
my
fate
with
patience
and
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
on
my
last
arrival
at
Paris
,
I
be
surround
by
a
croud
of
professed
admirer
,
who
sigh
and
flatter
in
the
usual
form
;
but
,
besides
that
my
heart
be
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
contract
new
engagement
,
I
be
prepossess
against
them
all
,
by
suppose
that
they
presume
upon
the
knowledge
of
my
indiscretion
with
S
#
#
#
#
;
and
therefore
reject
their
address
with
detestation
and
disdain
:
for
,
as
I
have
already
observe
,
I
be
not
to
be
win
,
but
by
the
appearance
of
esteem
and
the
most
respectful
carriage
;
and
though
,
by
a
false
step
,
I
have
,
in
my
own
opinion
,
forfeit
my
title
to
the
one
,
I
be
resolve
to
discourage
the
advance
of
any
man
who
seem
deficient
in
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
my
lover
be
,
one
by
one
,
repulse
,
almost
as
soon
as
they
present
themselves
,
and
I
preserve
the
independance
of
my
heart
,
until
I
become
acquaint
with
a
certain
peer
,
whom
I
often
see
at
the
house
of
Mrs
P
#
#
#
#
,
an
english
lady
then
resident
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
this
young
nobleman
profess
himself
deeply
enamour
of
me
,
in
a
stile
so
different
from
that
of
my
other
admirer
,
that
I
hear
his
protestation
without
disgust
;
and
though
my
inclination
be
still
free
,
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
discountenance
his
address
,
which
be
prefer
with
the
most
engaging
modesty
,
disinterestedness
and
respect
.
    
<EOS>
by
these
never
-
fail
art
,
he
gradually
conquer
my
indifference
,
and
gain
the
preference
in
my
esteem
from
lord
C####y
and
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
at
that
time
his
rival
.
<EOS>
but
what
contribute
(
more
than
any
consideration
)
to
his
success
,
be
his
declaring
openly
,
that
he
would
marry
me
without
hesitation
,
as
soon
as
I
could
obtain
a
divorce
from
my
present
husband
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
may
have
be
easily
procure
;
for
before
I
leave
England
,
lord
   
have
offer
me
five
thousand
pound
,
if
I
would
consent
to
such
a
mutual
release
,
that
he
may
be
at
liberty
to
espouse
one
Miss
W
#
#
#
#
of
Kent
,
to
whom
he
then
make
love
upon
honourable
term
:
but
I
be
fool
enough
to
refuse
his
proposal
,
by
the
advice
of
S
#
#
#
#
:
and
whether
or
not
his
lordship
find
it
impracticable
to
we
would
<EOS>
his
new
mistress
,
begin
to
make
love
upon
another
footing
,
I
know
not
;
but
certain
it
be
,
the
mother
forbad
him
the
house
,
a
circumstance
which
he
take
so
heinously
ill
,
that
he
appeal
to
the
world
in
a
public
advertisement
,
begin
with
,
<EOS>
whereas
,
for
some
time
,
I
have
passionately
love
Miss
W
#
#
#
#
,
and
upon
my
not
comply
with
the
mother
's
proposal
,
they
have
turn
me
out
of
door
;
this
be
to
justify
,
&
c.
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
,
sign
with
his
name
,
be
actually
print
in
a
number
of
detached
advertisement
,
which
he
order
to
be
distribute
to
the
public
;
and
afterwards
,
be
convince
by
some
of
his
friend
,
that
he
have
do
a
very
silly
thing
,
he
recall
them
at
half
a
guinea
apiece
.
<EOS>
a
copy
of
one
of
them
be
send
to
me
at
Paris
;
and
I
believe
my
father
have
now
one
of
the
original
in
his
possession
.
    
<EOS>
after
this
wise
vindication
of
his
conduct
,
he
make
an
attempt
to
carry
off
the
lady
from
church
,
by
force
of
arm
;
but
she
be
rescue
by
the
neighbour
,
head
by
her
brother
,
who
be
an
attorney
,
have
like
to
have
make
his
lordship
smart
severely
for
this
exploit
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
my
new
admirer
have
make
some
progress
in
my
heart
;
and
my
finance
be
exhaust
,
I
be
reduce
to
the
alternative
of
return
to
lord
   
again
,
or
accept
earl
B
#
#
#
#
's
love
.
<EOS>
when
my
affair
be
bring
to
that
issue
,
I
make
no
hesitation
in
my
choice
,
put
myself
under
the
protection
of
a
man
of
honour
,
whom
I
esteem
,
rather
than
suffer
every
sort
of
mortification
,
from
a
person
who
be
the
object
of
my
abhorrence
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
from
a
mistaken
pride
,
I
choose
to
live
in
lord
B####k
's
house
,
rather
than
be
maintain
at
his
expence
in
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
We
spend
several
month
agreeably
in
ball
and
other
diversion
,
visit
lord
b####k
,
who
live
at
the
distance
of
a
few
league
from
Paris
,
and
stay
some
day
at
his
house
,
where
the
entertainment
be
,
in
all
respect
,
delightful
,
elegant
,
and
refined
.
<EOS>
Their
habitation
be
the
rendezvous
of
the
good
company
in
France
;
and
lady
<EOS>
B####k
maintain
the
same
superiority
in
her
own
sex
,
for
which
her
lord
be
so
justly
distinguished
among
the
man
.
    
<EOS>
about
Christmas
we
set
out
for
England
,
accompany
by
a
little
North
Briton
,
who
live
with
lord
B
#
#
#
#
as
his
companion
,
and
do
not
at
all
approve
of
our
correspondence
;
whether
out
of
real
friendship
for
his
patron
,
or
apprehension
that
in
time
I
may
supersede
his
own
influence
with
my
lord
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
.
    
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
the
frost
be
so
severe
,
that
we
be
detain
ten
day
at
Calais
,
before
we
could
get
out
of
the
harbour
;
and
during
that
time
,
I
reflect
seriously
on
what
my
new
lover
have
propose
:
as
he
be
very
young
,
and
unacquainted
with
the
world
<EOS>
,
I
think
my
story
may
have
escape
him
;
and
therefore
determine
to
give
him
a
faithful
detail
of
the
whole
,
that
he
may
not
have
any
thing
to
reproach
me
with
in
the
sequel
;
besides
,
I
do
not
think
it
honest
to
engage
him
to
do
more
for
me
than
he
may
afterwards
,
perhaps
,
think
I
be
worth
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
communicate
to
him
every
particular
of
my
life
;
and
the
narration
,
far
from
alter
his
sentiment
,
rather
confirm
his
good
opinion
,
by
exhibit
an
undoubted
proof
of
my
frankness
and
sincerity
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
behave
with
such
generosity
,
as
make
an
absolute
conquest
of
my
heart
:
but
my
love
be
of
a
different
kind
from
that
which
have
formerly
reign
within
my
breast
,
be
found
upon
the
warm
gratitude
and
esteem
,
exclusive
of
any
other
consideration
,
though
his
person
be
very
agreeable
,
and
his
address
engage
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
in
England
,
I
go
directly
to
his
country
-
seat
,
about
twelve
mile
from
London
,
where
he
soon
join
me
,
and
we
live
some
time
in
perfect
retirement
,
his
relation
be
greatly
alarm
with
the
apprehension
that
lord
   
would
bring
an
action
against
him
;
though
he
himself
desire
nothing
more
,
and
live
so
easily
under
that
expectation
,
that
they
soon
lay
aside
their
fear
on
his
account
.
    
<EOS>
We
be
visit
by
Mr

a

of
the

who
,
with
the
little
Scotch
gentleman
and
my

make
an
agreeable
set

among
whom
I
enjoy
hunting

all
manner
of

as

in
him

or
at
least
,
<EOS>
he
,
of
all
the
man
I
ever
know
,
approach
nearest
to
that
idea
which
I
have
conceive
of
a
perfect
character

<EOS>
He
be
both
good
and
great
,
possess
an
uncommon
genius
and
the
good
of

Mr

be
a
very
sociable
man
,
have
a
good
person
and
cultivate
understanding

and
my
lord
be
excessively
good
humour
;
so
that
,
with
such
companion
,
no
place
could
be
dull
or
insipid
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
conduct
the
family
;
and
as
I
endeavour
to
please
and
make
every
body
happy
,
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
succeed
.

Mr

tell
me

that
before
he
see
me

he
hear
I
be
a
fool
;
but
find
(
as
he
be
pleased
to
say
)
that
I
have
be
egregiously
misrepresent
,
he
court
my
friendship
,
and
a
correspondence
commence
between
us
:
indeed
,
it
be
impossible
for
any
person
to
know
him
,
without
entertain
the
utmost
esteem
and
veneration
for
his
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
after
I
have
live
some
time
in
this
agreeable
retreat
,
my
husband
begin
to
make
a
bustle
:
he
send
a
message
,
demand
me
from
lord

then
come

with
his

intend
to
have
stay
all
night

have

and
attend
by
a
relation
,
whom
he
assure
that
I
be
very
fond
of
him
,
and
detain
by
force
from
his
arm
.
    
<EOS>
find
himself
disappoint
in
his
expectation
,
he
commence
a
law

suit
against
lord
B

,
though
not
for
a
divorce

as
we
desire

but
with
a
view
to

me
as
his
lawful

His

attempt
to
prove
criminal
conversation
,
in
hope
of
extort
money
from

mine
,
could
with
justice
say
,
we
be
ever
see
to
trespass
against
modesty
and
decorum
;
so
that
the
plaintiff
be
nonsuite
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
cause
be
depend
,
all
my
lover
's
friend
express
fear
and
concern
for
the
issue
,
while
he
himself
behave
with
the
utmost
resolution
,
and
give
me
such
convincing
proof
of
a
strong
and
steady
affection
,
as
augment
my
gratitude
,
and
rivette
the
tie
of
my
love
,
which
be
unblemished
,
faithful
and
sincere
.
    
<EOS>
soon
after
this
event
,
I
be
seize
with
a
violent
fit
of
illness
,
in
which
I
be
visit
by
my
father
,
and
attend
by
two
physician
,
one
of
whom
despair
of
my
life
,
and
take
his
leave
accordingly
;
but
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
the
other
,
persist
in
his
attendance
,
and
,
in
all
human
appearance
,
save
my
life
;
a
circumstance
by
which
he
acquire
a
great
share
of
reputation
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
all
his
assistance
,
I
be
confine
to
my
bed
for
ten
week
;
during
which
,
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
grief
be
immoderate
,
his
care
and
generosity
unlimited
.
<EOS>
whilst
I
lie
in
this
extremity
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
penetrate
by
my
melancholy
condition
,
which
revive
his
tenderness
,
begg'd
leave
to
be
admit
to
my
presence
;
and
lord
B
#
#
#
#
would
have
comply
with
his
request
,
have
I
not
be
judge
too
weak
to
bear
the
shock
of
such
an
interview
.
    
<EOS>
My
constitution
,
however
,
agreeably
disappoint
their
fear
;
and
the
fever
have
no
sooner
leave
me
,
than
I
be
remove
to
a
hunting
-
seat
belong
to
my
lover
,
from
whence
,
<EOS>
after
I
have
recover
my
strength
,
we
go
to
b
#
#
#
#
Castle
,
where
we
keep
open
house
:
and
while
we
remain
at
this
place
,
lord
B
#
#
#
#
receive
a
letter
from
lord
  
,
date
in
November
,
challenge
him
to
single
combat
in
May
,
upon
the
frontier
of
France
and
Flanders
.
<EOS>
this
defiance
be
send
in
consequence
of
what
have
pass
betwixt
them
long
before
my
indisposition
,
at
a
meeting
in
a
certain
tavern
,
where
they
quarrel
,
and
in
the
fray
my
lover
throw
his
antagonist
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
counsel
him
to
take
no
notice
of
this
rhodomontade
,
which
I
know
be
void
of
all
intention
of
performance
;
and
he
be
wise
enough
to
follow
my
advice
;
resolve
,
however
,
should
the
message
be
repeat
,
to
take
the
challenger
at
his
word
.
    
<EOS>
have
reside
some
time
in
this
place
,
we
return
to
the
other
country
-
house
which
we
have
leave
,
where
lord
B
#
#
#
#
addict
himself
so
much
to
hunting
,
and
other
male
diversion
,
that
I
begin
to
think
he
neglect
me
,
and
apprize
him
of
my
suspicion
;
assure
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
would
leave
him
as
soon
as
my
opinion
should
be
confirm
.
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
have
no
effect
upon
his
behaviour
,
which
become
so
remarkably
cold
,
that
even
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
,
who
live
with
us
,
imagine
that
his
affection
be
palpably
diminish
.
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
town
,
I
be
usually
attend
by
his
cousin
,
or
this
gentleman
,
or
both
,
but
seldom
favour
with
his
company
;
nay
,
when
I
repair
to
Bath
,
for
the
re
-
establishment
of
my
health
,
he
permit
me
to
go
alone
;
so
that
I
be
quite
persuade
of
his
indifference
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
be
mistaken
in
my
opinion
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
have
be
spoil
by
the
behaviour
of
my
first
husband
,
and
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
never
quit
me
for
the
sake
of
any
amusement
,
and
often
resist
the
call
of
the
most
urgent
business
,
rather
than
part
from
me
,
tho
'
<EOS>
but
for
a
few
hour
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
every
man
who
love
me
truly
,
would
act
in
the
same
manner
;
and
whether
I
be
right
or
wrong
in
my
conjecture
,
I
leave
wise
casuist
to
judge
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
such
sacrifice
and
devotion
be
the
most
pleasing
proof
of
an
admirer
's
passion
;
and
Voyez
moi
plus
souvent
,
&
ne
me
<EOS>
donnez
rien
,
be
one
of
my
favourite
maxim
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
give
money
,
because
he
be
profuse
;
he
may
be
violently
fond
,
because
he
be
of
a
sanguine
constitution
;
but
if
he
give
me
his
time
,
he
give
me
an
unquestionable
proof
of
my
being
in
full
possession
of
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
My
appearance
at
Bath
,
without
the
company
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
occasion
a
general
surprize
,
and
encourage
the
man
to
pester
me
with
address
;
every
new
admirer
endeavour
to
advance
his
suit
,
by
demonstrate
the
unkind
and
disrespectful
behaviour
of
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
be
the
most
effectual
string
they
could
touch
:
my
pride
and
resentment
be
alarm
,
and
I
be
weak
enough
to
listen
to
one
man
,
who
have
like
to
have
insinuate
himself
into
my
inclination
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
and
large
boned
,
with
white
hair
,
incline
to
what
be
call
sandy
,
and
have
the
reputation
of
be
handsome
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
think
he
scarce
deserve
that
epithet
.
<EOS>
He
possess
a
large
fortune
,
loved
mischief
,
and
stick
at
nothing
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
design
;
one
of
his
chief
pleasure
,
be
that
of
set
any
two
lover
at
variance
.
<EOS>
He
employ
his
address
upon
me
with
great
assiduity
,
and
know
so
well
how
to
manage
my
resentment
,
that
I
be
pleased
with
his
manner
,
hear
his
vow
without
disgust
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
promise
to
deliberate
with
myself
upon
his
proposal
,
and
give
him
an
account
of
my
determination
in
writing
.
    
<EOS>
thus
resolve
,
I
go
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
in
Wiltshire
,
whither
<EOS>
I
be
follow
by
this
pretender
to
my
heart
,
who
visit
us
on
the
footing
of
an
acquaintance
;
but
when
I
reflect
on
what
I
have
do
,
I
condemn
my
own
conduct
,
as
indiscreet
,
though
nothing
decisive
have
pass
between
us
,
and
begin
to
hate
him
in
proportion
to
the
self
-
conviction
I
feel
;
perceive
that
I
have
involve
myself
in
a
difficulty
from
which
I
should
not
be
easily
disengage
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
however
,
I
find
mean
to
postpone
my
declaration
;
he
admit
my
excuse
,
and
I
return
to
London
with
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
again
summon
to
the
field
by
his
former
challenger
.
    
<EOS>
H####d####n
,
governor
,
counsellor
,
and
steward
to
this
little
hero
,
come
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
with
a
verbal
message
,
import
,
that
his
lordship
have
change
his
mind
about
go
to
flander
,
but
expect
to
meet
him
,
on
such
a
day
and
hour
,
in
the
burying
-
ground
near
Red
-
lion
-
square
.
<EOS>
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
accept
the
challenge
,
and
give
me
an
account
of
what
have
pass
;
but
he
have
be
anticipate
by
the
messenger
,
who
have
already
try
to
alarm
my
fear
,
from
the
consideration
of
the
consequence
,
that
I
may
take
some
measure
to
prevent
their
meeting
.
<EOS>
but
I
perceive
his
drift
,
and
tell
him
plainly
that
lord
   
have
no
intention
to
risque
his
person
,
tho
'
he
endeavour
with
all
his
might
to
persuade
me
,
that
his
principal
be
desperate
and
determined
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
little
husband
too
well
,
to
think
he
would
bring
matter
to
any
dangerous
issue
,
and
be
apprehensive
of
nothing
but
foul
play
,
from
the
villainy
of
H####n
,
with
which
I
be
equally
well
acquaint
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
I
signify
my
doubt
on
that
score
to
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
would
have
attend
his
kinsman
to
the
field
,
have
he
not
think
he
may
be
liable
to
censure
,
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
because
he
himself
be
heir
at
law
:
for
that
reason
,
he
judiciously
decline
be
personally
concerned
;
and
we
pitch
upon
the
earl
of
a
#
#
#
#
,
his
lordship
's
uncle
,
who
willingly
undertake
the
office
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
time
they
go
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
they
have
not
wait
long
when
the
challenger
appear
,
in
a
new
pink
satin
waistcoat
,
which
he
have
put
on
for
the
occasion
,
with
his
sword
under
his
arm
,
and
his
steward
by
him
,
leave
,
in
an
hackney
coach
,
at
some
distance
,
a
surgeon
whom
he
have
provide
for
the
care
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
thus
equip
,
he
advance
to
his
antagonist
,
and
desire
him
to
choose
his
ground
;
upon
which
lord
B
#
#
#
#
tell
him
,
that
if
he
must
fall
,
it
be
not
material
which
grave
he
should
tumble
over
.
    
<EOS>
Our
little
hero
find
him
<EOS>
so
jocose
and
determine
,
turn
to
lord
a
#
#
#
#
,
and
desire
to
speak
with
him
,
that
he
may
disburden
his
conscience
before
they
should
begin
the
work
of
death
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
go
aside
;
and
he
give
him
to
understand
,
that
his
motive
for
fighting
be
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
detain
his
wife
from
him
,
by
compulsion
.
<EOS>
the
earl
of
a
#
#
#
#
assure
him
,
he
be
egregiously
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
;
that
his
nephew
use
no
force
or
undue
influence
,
to
keep
me
in
his
house
;
but
it
could
not
be
expect
that
he
would
turn
me
out
of
door
.
    
<EOS>
this
explanation
be
altogether
satisfactory
to
lord
  
,
who
say
he
be
far
from
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
lord
B
#
#
#
#
would
commit
such
a
breach
of
hospitality
;
and
all
he
desire
be
,
that
his
wife
should
be
leave
to
her
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
upon
these
article
peace
be
conclude
,
and
they
part
without
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
at
least
these
be
the
particular
of
the
story
,
as
they
be
relate
by
lord
a
#
#
#
#
,
with
whom
I
laugh'd
<EOS>
heartily
at
the
adventure
;
for
I
never
doubt
that
the
challenger
would
find
some
expedient
to
prevent
the
duel
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
he
muster
up
resolution
enough
to
carry
it
so
far
.
    
<EOS>
that
he
may
not
,
however
,
give
us
any
more
trouble
,
we
resolve
to
go
and
enjoy
ourselves
in
France
,
whither
<EOS>
I
go
by
myself
,
in
hope
of
be
soon
join
by
my
lover
,
who
be
oblige
to
stay
some
time
longer
in
England
,
to
settle
his
affair
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
affect
at
our
parting
<EOS>
(
tho
'
<EOS>
but
for
a
few
week
)
that
he
be
almost
distract
;
and
this
affliction
renew
my
tenderness
for
him
,
because
it
be
an
undoubted
proof
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
him
every
post
from
France
;
and
,
as
I
have
no
secret
,
desire
him
to
take
care
of
all
the
letter
that
should
come
to
his
house
,
direct
to
me
,
after
my
departure
from
England
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
an
unfortunate
office
for
him
,
in
the
execution
of
which
he
chance
to
open
a
letter
from
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
a
#
#
#
#
,
with
whom
(
as
I
have
already
observe
)
<EOS>
I
have
some
correspondence
at
Bath
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
,
accord
to
my
promise
,
give
this
gentleman
a
decisive
answer
,
import
,
that
I
be
determined
to
remain
in
my
present
situation
;
but
as
lord
B
#
#
#
#
be
ignorant
of
my
sentiment
in
that
particular
,
and
perceive
from
the
letter
that
something
extraordinary
have
pass
between
us
,
and
that
I
be
earnestly
sollicite
to
leave
him
,
he
be
seize
with
the
utmost
consternation
and
concern
;
and
have
previously
obtain
the
king
's
leave
to
go
abroad
,
set
out
that
very
night
for
France
,
leave
his
affair
in
the
great
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
Sir

<EOS>
I
be
go
,
without
understand
the
cause
of
my
departure
,
take
the
same
rout
,
and
both
arrive
at
Dover
next
day
.
<EOS>
They
hear
of
each
other
's
motion
:
<EOS>
each
bribe
the
master
of
a
packet
-
boat
to
transport
him
with
expedition
;
but
that
depend
upon
the
wind
,
both
reach
Calais
at
the
same
time
,
tho
'
in
different
vessel
.
<EOS>
Sir
T
#
#
#

send
his
valet
de
chambre
,
post
,
with
a
letter
,
intreate
me
to
accompany
him
into
Italy
,
where
he
would
make
me
mistress
of
his
whole
fortune
,
and
to
set
out
directly
for
that
country
,
that
he
may
not
lose
me
by
the
arrival
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
promise
to
join
me
on
the
road
,
if
I
would
consent
to
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
I
send
his
messenger
back
with
an
answer
,
wherein
I
express
surprize
at
his
proposal
,
after
have
signify
my
resolution
to
him
before
I
leave
England
;
and
he
be
scarce
dismiss
,
when
I
receive
another
letter
from
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
beseech
me
to
meet
him
at
Clermont
,
upon
the
road
from
Calais
;
and
conjure
me
to
avoid
the
sight
of
his
rival
<EOS>
,
should
he
get
the
start
of
him
in
travel
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
likely
to
be
the
case
,
as
lord
B
#
#
#
#
rode
post
,
and
the
other
be
,
by
his
corpulence
,
oblige
to
travel
in
a
chaise
;
yet
,
that
I
may
not
increase
his
anxiety
,
I
leave
Paris
immediately
on
the
receit
of
his
message
,
and
meet
him
at
the
appoint
place
,
where
he
receive
me
with
all
the
agitation
of
joy
and
fear
,
and
ask
if
I
have
ever
encourage
Sir
T

a
#
#

in
his
address

<EOS>
I
very
candidly
tell
him
the
whole
transaction
,
at
which
he
be
incense
;
but
his
indignation
be
soon
appease
,
when
I
profess
my
penitence
,
and
assure
him
,
that
I
have
totally
reject
his
rival
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
approve
of
my
behaviour
to
Sir

be

this
affair
;
but
surely
it
be
more
excusable
to
halt
here
,
than
proceed
farther
in
my
indiscretion
.
    
<EOS>
My
lover
be
satisfied
with
my
declaration
,
we
go
together
to
Paris
,
be
attend
by
the
Scotchman
whom
I
have
already
mention
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
not
over
and
above
well
pleased
to
see
matter
thus
amicably
compromise
.
<EOS>
the
furious
knight
follow
us
to
the
capital
;
insist
upon
see
me
in
person
;
tell
this
North
Briton
,
that
I
be
actually
engage
to
him
;
write
every
hour
,
and
rail
at
my
perfidious
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
take
no
notice
of
these
delirious
transport
,
which
be
also
disregard
by
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
till
one
night
he
be
exasperate
by
the
insinuation
of
Mr
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
I
believe
,
inflame
his
jealousy
,
by
hint
a
suspicion
that
I
be
really
in
love
with
his
rival
.
<EOS>
what
pass
betwixt
them
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
but
he
send
for
me
from
the
opera
,
by
a
physician
of
Paris
,
who
be
a
sort
of
go
-
between
among
us
all
,
and
who
tell
me
,
that
if
I
do
not
come
home
on
the
instant
,
a
duel
would
be
fight
on
my
account
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
shock
at
this
information
;
but
by
be
use
to
alarm
from
the
behaviour
of
lord
  
,
I
have
acquire
a
pretty
good
share
of
resolution
,
and
with
great
composure
enter
the
room
where
lord
B
#
#
#
#
be
,
with
his
companion
,
whom
I
immediately
order
to
withdraw
.
    
<EOS>
I
then
give
his
lordship
to
understand
,
that
I
be
inform
of
what
have
pass
,
and
think
myself
so
much
injure
by
the
person
who
have
just
quit
the
apartment
,
that
I
would
no
longer
live
under
the
same
roof
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
rave
like
a
bedlamite
,
tax
me
with
want
of
candour
and
affection
;
but
I
easily
justify
my
own
integrity
,
and
give
him
such
assurance
of
my
love
,
that
his
jealousy
subside
,
and
his
spirit
be
recompose
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
I
insist
upon
his
dismiss
Mr
C
#
#
#
#
,
on
pain
of
my
leave
the
house
,
as
I
could
not
help
think
he
have
use
his
endeavour
to
prejudice
me
in
the
opinion
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
if
his
conduct
be
the
result
of
friendship
for
his
patron
,
he
certainly
act
the
part
of
an
honest
and
trusty
adherent
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
easily
forgive
him
,
because
,
a
few
week
before
,
he
have
,
by
my
interest
,
obtain
a
considerable
addition
to
his
allowance
;
and
even
after
the
step
he
have
take
to
disoblige
me
,
I
be
not
so
much
his
enemy
but
that
I
prevail
upon
lord
B
#
#
#
#
to
double
his
salary
,
that
his
leave
the
family
may
be
no
detriment
to
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
comply
with
my
demand
,
this
gentleman
,
after
have
stay
three
day
in
the
house
,
to
prepare
for
his
departure
,
during
which
I
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
admit
into
my
presence
,
make
his
retreat
with
a
fine
young
girl
who
be
my
companion
;
and
I
have
never
see
him
since
that
time
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
still
continue
furious
,
and
would
not
take
a
denial
,
except
from
my
own
mouth
;
upon
which
,
with
the
approbation
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
I
indulge
him
with
an
interview
.
<EOS>
He
enter
the
apartment
with
a
stern
countenance
,
and
tell
me
I
have
<EOS>
us'd
him
ill
.
<EOS>
I
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
,
and
begg'd
his
pardon
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
reason
the
case
with
him
,
but
he
would
hear
no
argument
except
his
own
,
and
even
try
to
intimidate
me
with
threat
;
which
provoke
me
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
defy
his
vengeance
,
tell
him
that
I
fear
nothing
but
the
reproach
of
my
own
conscience
;
that
tho
'
I
have
act
a
simple
part
,
he
durst
not
say
there
be
any
thing
criminal
in
my
conduct
;
and
that
,
from
his
present
frantic
and
unjust
behaviour
,
I
think
myself
happy
in
have
escape
him
.
<EOS>
He
swear
I
be
the
most
inflexible
of
all
creature
,
<EOS>
ask
if
nothing
would
move
me
?
<EOS>
and
when
I
answer
,
"
nothing
,
"
take
his
leave
,
and
never
afterwards
persecute
me
with
his
address
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
have
hear
he
be
vain
and
false
enough
to
boast
of
favour
,
which
,
upon
my
honour
,
he
never
receive
,
as
he
himself
,
at
one
time
,
own
to
doctor
Cantwell
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
undergo
all
this
frenzy
and
distraction
upon
my
account
,
he
be
love
with
the
same
violence
of
passion
by
a
certain
Scotch
lady
of
quality
,
who
,
when
he
follow
me
to
France
,
pursue
him
thither
with
the
same
eagerness
and
expedition
;
and
,
far
from
be
jealous
of
me
as
a
rival
,
us'd
to
come
to
my
house
,
implore
my
good
office
with
the
object
of
her
love
,
and
lay
herself
on
the
floor
at
full
length
,
before
the
fire
,
weep
and
cry
like
a
person
bereft
of
her
sense
.
<EOS>
She
bitterly
complain
,
that
he
have
never
oblige
her
but
once
;
and
begg'd
,
with
the
most
earnest
supplication
,
that
I
would
give
her
an
opportunity
of
see
him
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
proper
to
avoid
her
company
,
as
soon
as
I
perceive
her
intention
.
    
<EOS>
We
continue
at
Paris
for
some
time
,
during
which
I
contract
an
acquaintance
with
the
sister
of
madam
la
T
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
suppose
mistress
of
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#

,
endow
with
a
great
share
of
understanding
,
and
love
pleasure
to
excess
,
tho
'
she
maintain
her
reputation
on
a
respectable
footing
,
by
live
with
her
husband
and
mother
.
<EOS>
this
lady
,
perceive
that
I
have
inspire
her
lover
with
a
passion
,
which
give
me
uneasiness
on
her
account
,
actually
practise
all
her
eloquence
and
art
,
in
persuade
me
to
listen
to
his
love
;
for
it
be
a
maxim
with
her
,
to
please
him
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
be
shocked
at
her
indelicate
complaisance
,
and
reject
the
proposal
,
as
repugnant
to
my
present
engagement
,
which
I
hold
as
sacred
as
any
nuptial
tie
,
and
much
more
binding
than
a
forced
or
unnatural
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
upon
our
return
to
England
we
live
in
great
harmony
and
peace
;
and
nothing
be
want
to
my
happiness
,
but
the
one
thing
to
me
most
needful
<EOS>
;
I
mean
the
inchanting
tenderness
and
delightful
enthusiasm
of
love
.
<EOS>
Lord

's
heart
(
I
believe
)
feel
the
soft
impression
;
and
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
love
him
with
the
most
faithful
affection
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
enough
to
say
I
wish
him
well
;
I
have
the
most
delicate
,
the
most
genuine
esteem
for
his
virtue
,
I
have
an
intimate
regard
and
anxiety
for
his
interest
,
and
feel
for
him
as
if
he
have
be
my
own
son
:
<EOS>
but
still
there
be
a
vacancy
in
my
heart
;
there
be
not
that
fervour
,
that
transport
,
that
ecstasy
of
passion
which
I
have
formerly
know
;
my
bosom
be
not
fill
with
the
little
deity
;
I
could
not
help
recall
to
my
remembrance
the
fond
,
the
ravish
moment
I
have
pass
with
S
#
#
#
#
;
and
have
I
understand
the
condition
of
life
,
those
pleasure
be
happily
exchange
for
my
present
situation
,
because
,
if
I
be
now
deprive
of
those
rapturous
enjoyment
,
I
be
also
exempt
from
the
care
and
anxiety
that
attend
them
;
but
I
be
generally
extravagant
in
my
notion
of
happiness
,
and
therefore
construe
my
present
tranquillity
into
an
insipid
languor
and
stagnation
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
remain
in
this
inactivity
of
sentiment
,
lord
   
have
receive
a
very
considerable
addition
to
his
fortune
,
send
a
message
to
me
,
promise
,
that
if
I
would
leave
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
he
would
make
me
a
present
of
an
house
and
furniture
,
where
I
should
live
at
my
ease
,
without
be
expose
to
his
visit
,
except
when
I
should
be
dispose
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
this
proposal
he
make
,
in
consequence
of
what
I
have
always
declare
,
namely
,
that
if
he
have
not
reduce
me
to
the
necessity
of
put
myself
under
the
protection
of
some
person
or
other
,
by
deprive
me
of
any
other
mean
of
subsistence
,
I
should
never
have
give
the
world
the
least
cause
to
scandalize
my
reputation
;
and
that
I
would
withdraw
myself
from
my
present
dependance
,
as
soon
as
he
should
enable
me
to
live
by
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
resolve
to
be
as
good
as
my
word
,
and
accept
his
offer
,
on
condition
that
I
should
be
wholly
at
my
own
disposal
,
and
that
he
should
never
enter
my
door
but
as
a
visitant
or
common
friend
.
    
<EOS>
these
article
be
sanction
by
his
word
and
honour
(
the
value
of
which
I
do
not
then
know
)
<EOS>
an
house
be
furnish
accord
to
my
direction
;
and
I
signify
my
intention
to
lord
B
#
#
#

,
who
consent
to
my
removal
,
with
this
proviso
,
that
I
should
continue
to
see
him
.
    
<EOS>
I
write
also
to
his
relation
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
in
his
answer
,
observe
,
that
it
be
too
late
to
advise
when
I
be
actually
determine
.
<EOS>
all
my
friend
and
acquaintance
approve
of
the
scheme
,
tho
'
it
be
one
of
the
most
unjustifiable
step
I
have
ever
take
,
be
a
real
act
of
ingratitude
to
my
benefactor
;
which
I
soon
do
,
and
always
shall
regret
and
condemn
.
<EOS>
so
little
be
the
world
qualified
to
judge
of
private
affair
!
    
<EOS>
when
the
time
of
our
parting
draw
near
,
lord
B
#
#
#
#
become
gloomy
and
discontende
,
and
even
intreate
me
to
postpone
my
resolution
;
but
I
tell
him
,
that
now
every
thing
be
prepare
for
my
reception
,
I
could
not
retract
without
incur
the
imputation
of
folly
and
extravagance
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
of
my
departure
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
endeavour
,
with
all
the
argument
he
could
suggest
,
to
dissuade
me
from
my
purpose
;
and
I
make
use
of
the
same
answer
which
have
satisfy
his
friend
.
<EOS>
find
me
determine
upon
remove
,
he
burst
out
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
exclaim
,
"
by
G####d
,
if
lord
B
#
#
#
#
can
bear
it
,
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
thunderstruck
at
this
expression
;
for
tho
'
I
have
be
tell
that
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
be
in
love
with
me
,
I
give
no
credit
to
the
report
,
because
he
have
never
declare
his
passion
,
and
this
be
the
first
hint
of
it
that
ever
escape
him
in
my
heating
.
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
so
much
amazed
at
the
circumstance
of
this
abrupt
explanation
,
that
I
could
make
no
answer
;
but
have
take
my
leave
,
go
away
,
ruminate
on
the
unforeseen
event
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
(
as
I
be
inform
)
speak
not
a
word
that
whole
night
,
and
take
my
leave
him
so
much
to
heart
,
that
two
year
elapse
before
he
get
the
well
of
his
grief
.
    
<EOS>
this
intelligence
I
afterwards
receive
from
his
own
mouth
,
and
ask
his
forgiveness
for
my
unkind
retreat
,
tho
<EOS>
'
I
shall
never
be
able
to
obtain
my
own
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
he
be
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
,
and
make
such
effort
to
suppress
his
concern
,
as
have
well
nigh
cost
him
his
life
.
<EOS>
Dr
s
#
#
#
#
be
call
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
find
him
almost
suffocate
.
<EOS>
He
soon
guess
the
cause
,
when
he
understand
that
I
have
leave
the
house
:
so
that
I
myself
be
the
only
person
concerned
who
be
utterly
ignorant
of
his
affection
;
for
I
solemnly
declare
he
never
give
me
the
least
reason
to
suspect
it
while
I
live
with
his
relation
,
because
he
have
too
much
honour
to
entertain
a
thought
of
supplant
his
friend
,
and
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
to
believe
he
should
have
succeed
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
tho
'
my
love
for
lord
B
#
#
#
#
be
not
so
tender
and
interesting
as
the
passion
I
have
feel
for
S
#
#
#
#
,
my
fidelity
be
inviolable
,
and
I
never
harbour
the
most
distant
thought
of
any
other
person
,
till
after
I
have
resolve
to
leave
him
,
when
(
I
own
)
<EOS>
I
afford
some
small
encouragement
to
the
address
of
a
new
admirer
,
by
tell
him
,
that
I
should
,
in
a
little
time
,
be
my
own
mistress
<EOS>
,
tho
'
I
be
not
now
at
my
own
disposal
.
    
<EOS>
I
enjoy
my
new
house
as
a
little
paradise
:
it
be
accommodate
with
all
sort
of
convenience
;
every
thing
be
new
,
and
therefore
pleasing
,
and
the
whole
absolutely
at
my
command
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
the
company
of
a
relation
,
a
very
good
woman
,
with
whom
I
live
in
the
most
amicable
manner
;
be
visit
by
the
good
people
in
town
(
I
mean
those
of
the
male
sex
,
the
lady
have
long
ago
forsake
me
;
)
<EOS>
I
frequent
all
reputable
place
of
publick
entertainment
,
and
have
a
concert
at
home
once
a
week
:
so
that
my
day
roll
on
in
happiness
and
quiet
,
till
all
my
sweet
be
imbittere
by
the
vexatious
behaviour
of
my
husband
,
who
begin
to
importune
me
again
to
live
with
him
;
and
by
the
increase
anxiety
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
(
tho
'
I
still
admit
his
visit
)
plainly
perceive
that
I
want
to
relinquish
his
correspondence
.
<EOS>
this
discovery
raise
such
tempest
of
jealousy
and
despair
within
his
breast
,
that
he
keep
me
in
continual
alarm
:
he
send
message
to
me
every
hour
,
sign
his
letter
with
his
own
blood
,
rave
like
a
man
in
an
ecstasy
of
madness
,
rail
at
my
ingratitude
,
and
praise
my
conduct
,
by
turn
;
offer
to
sacrifice
every
thing
for
my
love
,
to
leave
the
kingdom
forthwith
,
and
live
with
me
for
ever
in
any
part
of
the
world
where
I
should
choose
to
reside
.
    
<EOS>
these
be
generous
and
tempting
proposal
;
but
I
be
beset
with
counsellor
who
be
not
totally
disintereste
,
and
who
dissuade
me
from
embrace
the
proffer
of
my
lover
,
on
pretence
that
lord
   
would
be
highly
injure
by
my
compliance
.
<EOS>
I
listen
to
their
advice
,
and
harden
my
heart
against
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
sorrow
and
solicitation
.
<EOS>
My
behaviour
on
this
occasion
be
altogether
unaccountable
;
this
be
the
only
time
that
ever
I
be
a
slave
to
admonition
.
<EOS>
the
condition
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
would
have
melt
any
heart
but
mine
,
and
yet
mine
be
one
of
the
most
sensible
:
he
employ
his
cousin
as
an
advocate
with
me
,
till
that
gentleman
actually
refuse
the
office
,
tell
him
candidly
,
that
his
own
inclination
be
too
much
engaged
,
to
permit
him
to
perform
the
task
with
fidelity
and
truth
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
resolve
to
avoid
my
presence
,
until
my
lord
and
I
should
come
to
some
final
determination
,
which
be
greatly
retard
by
the
perseverance
of
his
lordship
,
who
would
not
resign
his
hope
even
when
I
pretend
that
another
man
have
engage
my
heart
,
but
say
,
that
in
time
my
affection
may
return
.
    
<EOS>
Our
correspondence
,
however
,
gradually
wear
off
;
upon
which
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
renew
his
visit
,
and
many
agreeable
and
happy
hour
we
pass
together
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
,
or
any
other
person
whom
I
now
see
,
succeed
to
the
privilege
of
a
fortunate
lover
:
I
know
he
love
me
to
madness
;
but
I
would
not
gratify
his
passion
any
other
way
than
by
the
most
profound
esteem
and
veneration
for
his
virtue
,
which
be
altogether
amiable
and
sublime
;
and
I
would
here
draw
his
character
minutely
,
but
it
wou'd
take
up
too
much
time
to
set
forth
his
merit
;
the
only
man
live
of
my
acquaintance
who
resemble
him
be
lord
F
#
#
#
#
,
of
whom
I
shall
speak
in
the
sequel
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
I
undergo
a
very
interesting
change
in
the
situation
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
send
a
message
to
my
old
lover
S
#
#
#
#
,
desire
he
would
allow
my
picture
,
which
be
in
his
possession
,
to
be
copy
;
and
he
now
transmit
it
to
me
by
my
lawyer
,
whom
he
direct
to
ask
,
if
I
intend
to
be
at
the
next
masquerade
.
<EOS>
this
curiosity
have
a
strange
effect
upon
my
spirit
;
my
heart
flutter
at
the
question
,
and
my
imagination
glow
with
a
thousand
fond
presage
.
<EOS>
I
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
and
we
meet
by
accident
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
behold
him
without
emotion
;
when
he
accost
me
,
his
well
-
know
voice
make
my
heart
vibrate
,
like
a
musical
chord
,
when
its
unison
be
strike
.
    
<EOS>
all
the
idea
of
our
past
love
,
which
the
lapse
of
time
and
absence
have
enfeeble
and
lull
asleep
,
now
awoke
,
and
be
reinspire
by
his
appearance
;
so
that
his
artful
excuse
be
easily
admit
:
I
forgave
him
all
that
I
have
suffer
on
his
account
,
because
he
be
the
natural
lord
of
my
affection
;
and
our
former
correspondence
be
renew
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
myself
in
a
new
world
of
bliss
,
in
consequence
of
this
reconciliation
,
the
rapture
of
which
continue
unimpaired
for
the
space
of
four
month
,
during
which
time
he
be
fonder
of
me
,
if
possible
,
than
before
,
repeat
his
promise
of
marriage
,
if
we
should
ever
have
it
in
our
power
;
assure
me
he
have
never
be
happy
since
he
leave
me
;
that
he
believe
no
woman
have
ever
love
like
me
:
and
indeed
,
to
have
a
notion
of
my
passion
for
that
man
,
you
must
first
have
love
as
I
do
:
but
,
through
a
strange
caprice
,
I
break
off
the
correspondence
,
out
of
apprehension
that
he
would
forsake
me
again
.
<EOS>
from
his
past
conduct
,
I
dread
what
may
happen
;
and
the
remembrance
of
what
I
have
undergo
by
his
inconstancy
,
fill
my
imagination
with
such
horror
,
that
I
could
not
endure
the
shocking
prospect
,
and
prematurely
plunge
myself
into
the
danger
,
rather
than
endure
the
terror
of
expectation
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
desertion
,
I
receive
a
letter
from
him
,
acknowledge
that
he
be
rightly
serve
,
but
that
it
give
him
inexpressible
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
lord
   
continue
to
act
in
the
character
of
a
fiend
,
torment
me
with
his
nauseous
importunity
:
he
prevail
upon
the
duke
of
l
#
#
#
#
to
employ
his
influence
in
persuade
me
to
live
with
him
;
assure
his
grace
,
that
I
have
actually
promise
to
give
him
that
proof
of
my
obedience
,
and
that
I
would
come
home
the
sooner
for
be
press
to
compliance
by
a
person
of
his
rank
and
character
.
    
<EOS>
induce
by
these
representation
,
the
duke
honour
me
with
a
visit
;
and
in
the
course
of
his
exhortation
I
understand
how
he
have
be
thus
misinform
:
upon
which
I
send
for
lord
  
,
and
in
his
presence
convict
him
of
the
falshood
,
by
communicate
to
his
grace
the
article
of
our
last
agreement
,
which
he
do
not
think
proper
to
deny
;
and
the
duke
be
undeceived
,
declare
that
he
would
not
have
give
me
the
trouble
of
vindicate
myself
,
have
he
not
be
mislead
by
the
insincerity
of
my
lord
.
    
<EOS>
baffle
in
this
attempt
,
he
engage
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
v
#
#
#
#
,
and
afterwards
my
own
father
,
in
the
same
task
;
and
tho
'
I
still
adhere
to
my
first
resolution
,
persist
with
such
obstinacy
in
his
endeavour
to
make
me
unhappy
,
that
I
determine
to
leave
the
kingdom
;
and
accordingly
,
after
I
have
spend
the
evening
with
him
at
Ranelagh
,
I
go
away
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
leave
my
companion
,
with
direction
to
restore
to
my
lord
his
house
,
furniture
,
plate
,
and
every
thing
he
have
give
me
since
our
last
accommodation
;
so
far
be
I
,
upon
this
occasion
,
or
at
any
other
time
of
my
life
,
from
embezzle
any
part
of
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
My
friend
follow
my
instruction
most
punctually
;
and
his
lordship
know
,
and
will
acknowledge
,
the
truth
of
this
assertion
.
    
<EOS>
thus
have
I
explain
the
true
cause
of
my
first
expedition
to
flander
,
whither
the
world
be
good
-
natured
enough
to
say
I
follow
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
and
the
whole
army
,
which
happen
to
be
send
abroad
that
summer
.
<EOS>
before
my
departure
I
likewise
transmit
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
the
dressing
-
plate
,
china
,
and
a
very
considerable
settlement
,
of
which
he
have
be
generous
enough
to
make
me
a
present
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
an
instance
of
my
integrity
,
which
I
think
due
to
a
man
who
have
lay
me
under
great
obligation
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
I
have
live
to
be
refuse
a
small
sum
both
by
him
and
S
#
#
#
#
,
I
do
not
repent
of
my
disinterested
behaviour
;
and
all
the
revenge
I
harbour
against
the
last
of
these
lover
,
be
the
desire
of
have
it
in
my
power
to
do
him
good
.
    
<EOS>
I
now
find
myself
adrift
in
the
world
again
,
and
very
richly
deserve
the
hardship
of
my
condition
,
for
my
indiscretion
in
leave
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
and
in
trust
to
the
word
of
lord
  
,
without
some
farther
security
;
but
I
have
dearly
pay
for
my
imprudence
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
into
the
character
of
this
man
whom
destiny
hath
appoint
my
scourge
,
the
more
be
I
determine
to
avoid
his
fellowship
and
communication
;
for
he
and
I
be
,
in
point
of
disposition
,
as
opposite
as
any
two
principle
in
nature
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
one
of
the
most
unsocial
being
that
ever
exist
;
when
I
be
pleased
and
happy
he
be
always
out
of
temper
,
but
if
he
could
find
mean
to
overcast
and
cloud
my
mirth
,
tho
'
never
so
innocent
,
he
then
discover
the
sign
of
uncommon
satisfaction
and
content
,
because
,
by
this
disagreeable
temper
,
he
banish
all
company
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
weak
of
understanding
,
tho
'
he
possess
a
good
share
of
low
cunning
,
which
have
so
egregiously
impose
upon
some
people
,
that
they
have
actually
believe
him
a
good
-
natured
easy
creature
,
and
blame
me
because
I
do
not
manage
him
to
well
purpose
;
but
,
upon
further
acquaintance
,
they
have
always
find
him
obstinate
as
a
mule
,
and
capricious
as
a
monkey
.
    
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
utterly
void
of
all
commendable
quality
:
he
be
punctual
in
pay
his
debt
,
liberal
when
in
good
humour
,
and
would
be
well
breed
,
be
he
not
subject
to
fit
of
absence
,
during
which
he
be
altogether
unconversable
;
but
he
be
proud
,
naturally
suspicious
,
jealous
,
equally
with
and
without
cause
,
never
make
a
friend
,
and
be
an
utter
stranger
to
the
joy
of
intimacy
;
in
short
,
he
hang
like
a
damp
upon
society
,
and
may
be
properly
call
kill
-
joy
,
an
epithet
which
he
have
justly
acquire
.
<EOS>
He
honour
me
with
constant
profession
of
love
,
but
his
conduct
be
so
opposite
to
my
sentiment
of
that
passion
,
as
to
have
be
the
prime
source
of
all
my
misfortune
and
affliction
;
and
I
have
often
wish
myself
the
object
of
his
hate
,
in
hope
of
profit
by
a
change
in
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
not
be
able
to
make
me
more
unhappy
than
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
he
be
in
his
own
mind
;
for
he
be
literally
a
self
-
tormentor
,
who
never
enjoy
one
gleam
of
satisfaction
,
except
at
the
expence
of
another
be
quiet
;
and
yet
with
this
(
I
have
almost
call
it
diabolical
)
quality
,
he
expect
that
I
should
cherish
him
with
all
the
tenderness
of
affection
;
and
after
he
have
be
at
pain
to
incur
my
aversion
,
punish
my
disgust
,
by
contrive
scheme
to
mortify
and
perplex
me
,
which
have
often
succeed
so
effectually
,
as
to
endanger
my
life
and
constitution
;
for
I
have
be
fret
and
fright
into
sundry
fit
of
illness
,
and
then
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
experience
his
care
and
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
the
oddity
I
have
mention
,
he
be
so
unsteady
in
his
oeconomy
,
that
he
be
always
new
model
his
affair
,
and
exhaust
his
fortune
,
by
lay
out
ten
pound
,
in
order
to
save
a
shilling
;
he
inquire
into
the
character
of
a
servant
after
he
have
live
two
year
in
his
family
,
and
be
so
ridiculously
stock
with
vanity
and
self
-
conceit
,
that
notwithstanding
my
assurance
before
,
and
the
whole
series
of
my
conduct
since
our
marriage
,
which
ought
to
have
convince
him
of
my
dislike
,
he
be
still
persuade
,
that
at
bottom
,
I
must
admire
and
be
enamour
of
his
agreeable
person
and
accomplishment
,
and
that
I
would
not
fail
to
manifest
my
love
,
be
I
not
spirit
up
against
him
by
his
own
relation
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
be
their
interest
to
foment
the
misunderstanding
betwixt
us
;
but
really
,
they
give
themselves
no
trouble
about
our
affair
;
and
,
so
far
as
I
know
them
,
be
a
very
good
sort
of
people
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
I
think
I
may
with
justice
pronounce
<EOS>
my
precious
yoke
-
fellow
a
trifling
,
teazing
,
insufferable
,
inconsistent
creature
.
    
<EOS>
with
the
little
money
which
remain
of
what
I
have
receive
from
his
lordship
,
for
housekeeping
,
I
transport
myself
to
Flanders
,
and
arrive
in
Ghent
,
a
few
day
after
our
troop
be
quarter
in
that
city
,
which
be
so
much
crowd
with
these
new
visitant
,
that
I
should
have
find
it
impracticable
to
procure
a
lodging
,
have
I
not
be
accommodate
by
lord
R

b

#

,
the
duke
of
a

#
#

's
young
brother
,
who
very
politely
give
me
up
his
own
.
<EOS>
here
I
see
my
friend
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
overjoy
at
my
arrival
,
though
jealous
of
every
man
of
his
acquaintance
;
for
he
love
me
with
all
the
ardour
of
passion
,
and
I
regard
him
with
all
the
perfection
of
friendship
,
which
,
have
he
live
,
<EOS>
in
time
may
have
produce
love
;
but
it
never
do
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
earnest
solicitation
to
the
contrary
,
I
stay
but
<EOS>
a
week
in
Ghent
,
from
whence
I
proceed
to
Brussels
,
and
fix
my
abode
in
the
Hotel
de
Flandre
,
among
an
agreeable
set
of
gentleman
and
lady
,
with
whom
I
spend
my
time
very
chearfully
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
court
in
this
city
,
it
be
frequent
by
all
the
officer
,
who
could
obtain
permission
to
go
thither
;
and
the
place
in
general
be
gay
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
be
introduce
to
the
good
family
,
and
very
happy
in
my
acquaintance
;
for
the
lady
be
polite
,
good
tempered
,
and
oblige
,
and
treat
me
with
the
utmost
hospitality
and
respect
.
<EOS>
among
other
,
I
contract
a

with

of
vanity
and

conceit

<EOS>
the
second
have
a
good
face
,
though
a
clumsy
person
,
and
a
very
sweet
disposition
,
very
much
adapt
for
the
sentimental
passion
of
love
:
and
the
third
<EOS>
(
Mr

by
name
)
be
tall
,
thin
,
and
well
-
breed
,
with
a
great
stock
of
good
nature
and
vivacity
.
    
<EOS>
these
adventurer
begin
their
address
in
general
act
of
gallantry
,
that
comprehend
several
of
my
female
friend
,
with
whom
we
use
to
engage
in
party
of
pleasure
,
both
in
the
city
and
the
environ
,
which
be
extremely
agreeable
;
and
when
they
think
they
have
take
the
preliminary
step
of
secure
themselves
in
my
good
opinion
and
esteem
,
they
agree
to
go
on
without
farther
delay
,
and
that
lord
   
should
make
the
first
attack
upon
my
heart
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
lay
siege
to
me
,
with
such
warmth
and
assiduity
,
<EOS>
that
I
believe
he
deceive
himself
,
and
begin
to
think
he
be
actually
in
love
;
though
at
bottom
,
he
feel
no
impulse
that
deserve
the
sacred
name
.
<EOS>
though
I
discourage
him
in
the
beginning
,
he
persecute
me
with
his
address
;
he
always
sit
by
me
at
dinner
,
and
impart
a
thousand
trifle
in
continual
whisper
,
which
attract
the
notice
of
the
company
so
much
,
that
I
begin
to
fear
his
behaviour
would
give
rise
to
some
report
to
my
prejudice
;
and
therefore
avoid
him
with
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
my
care
,
however
,
he
find
mean
one
night
,
while
my
maid
,
who
lie
in
my
room
,
go
down
stair
,
to
get
into
my
chamber
after
I
be
abed
:
upon
which
,
I
start
up
,
and
tell
him
,
that
if
he
should
approach
me
,
I
would
alarm
the
house
;
for
I
never
want
courage
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
perceive
my
displeasure
,
he
kneel
by
the
bed
-
side
,
<EOS>
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
have
pity
on
his
suffering
,
and
swear
I
should
have
carte
blanche
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
to
these
proposal
I
make
no
other
reply
,
but
that
of
protest
I
would
never
speak
to
him
again
,
if
he
do
not
quit
my
apartment
that
moment
;
upon
which
,
he
think
proper
to
withdraw
;
and
I
never
afterwards
give
him
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
me
on
the
same
subject
:
so
that
,
in
a
few
week
,
he
separate
himself
from
our
society
;
though
the
lady
of
Brussels
consider
him
as
my
lover
,
because
,
of
all
the
other
officer
,
he
be
their
great
favourite
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
thus
repulse
,
Mr
W
#
#
#
#
take
the
field
,
and
assail
my
heart
in
a
very
different
manner
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
know
not
how
to
make
love
,
but
be
a
man
of
honour
,
would
keep
the
secret
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
to
this
cavalier
address
I
answer
,
that
I
be
not
angry
,
as
I
otherwise
should
have
be
at
his
blunt
declaration
,
because
I
find
,
by
his
own
confession
,
he
do
not
know
what
be
due
to
the
sex
;
and
my
unhappy
situation
in
some
shape
excuse
him
for
a
liberty
,
which
he
would
not
have
dream'd
of
taking
,
have
not
my
misfortune
encourage
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
deal
with
him
in
his
own
way
;
and
far
from
assume
the
prude
,
frankly
assure
him
,
that
he
be
not
at
all
to
my
taste
,
hope
he
would
consider
my
dislike
as
a
sufficient
reason
to
reject
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
R
#

#
#
begin
to
feel
the
symptom
of
a
genuine
passion
,
which
he
carefully
cherish
in
silence
,
be
naturally
diffident
and
bashful
;
but
,
by
the
very
mean
he
use
to
conceal
it
from
my
observation
,
I
plainly
discern
the
situation
of
his
heart
,
and
be
not
at
all
displease
at
the
progress
I
have
make
in
his
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
cultivate
my
acquaintance
with
great
assiduity
and
respect
,
attend
me
in
all
my
excursion
,
and
particularly
in
an
expedition
to
Antwerp
,
with
two
other
gentleman
,
where
,
in
downright
gaiet
de
coeur
,
we
sit
for
our
picture
,
which
be
draw
in
one
piece
;
one
of
the
partie
be
represent
in
the
dress
of
an
hussar
,
and
another
in
that
of
a
run
footman
.
<EOS>
this
incident
I
mention
,
because
the
performance
,
which
be
now
in
my
possession
,
give
birth
to
a
thousand
groundless
report
,
that
circulate
in
England
at
our
expence
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
immediately
after
this
jaunt
,
that
lord
R
#
#
#
#
begin
to
disclose
his
passion
;
though
he
,
at
the
same
time
,
start
such
objection
as
seem
well
nigh
to
extinguish
his
hope
,
lament
,
that
even
if
he
should
have
the
happiness
to
engage
my
affection
,
his
fortune
be
too
inconsiderable
to
support
us
against
the
effort
of
lord
  
,
should
he
attempt
to
interrupt
our
felicity
;
and
that
he
himself
be
oblige
to
follow
the
motion
of
the
army
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
seem
to
consider
my
felicity
more
than
his
own
,
and
behave
with
such
delicacy
,
as
gradually
make
an
impression
on
my
heart
;
so
that
when
we
part
,
we
agree
to
renew
our
correspondence
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
agreeable
amusement
,
which
I
enjoy
in
almost
all
the
different
town
of
flander
,
I
happen
to
be
at
Ghent
one
day
,
sit
among
a
good
deal
of
company
,
in
one
of
their
hotel
,
when
a
post
-
chaise
stop
at
the
gate
;
upon
which
we
go
to
the
window
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
,
when
who
should
step
out
of
the
convenience
,
but
my
little
insignificant
lord
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
announce
him
to
the
company
,
than
all
the
gentleman
ask
whether
they
should
stay
and
protect
me
,
or
withdraw
;
and
when
I
assure
them
,
that
their
protection
be
not
necessary
,
one
and
all
of
them
retire
;
though
lord
R

M

go
no
farther
than
the
parlour
below
,
be
determine
to
screen
me
against
all
violence
and
compulsion
.
    
<EOS>
I
send
a
message
to
my
lord
,
desire
him
to
walk
up
into
my
apartment
;
but
although
his
sole
errand
be
to
see
and
carry
me
off
,
he
would
not
venture
to
accept
of
my
invitation
,
till
he
have
demand
me
in
form
,
from
the
governor
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
that
gentleman
be
altogether
a
stranger
to
his
person
and
character
,
refer
him
to
the
command
officer
of
the
english
troop
,
who
be
a
man
of
humour
,
and
upon
his
lordship
's
application
,
pretend
to
doubt
his
identity
;
observe
,
that
he
have
always
hear
lord
   
represent
as
a
jolly
corpulent
man
.
<EOS>
He
give
him
to
understand
,
however
,
that
even
grant
him
to
be
the
person
<EOS>
,
I
be
by
no
means
subject
to
military
law
,
unless
he
could
prove
,
that
I
have
ever
inliste
in
his
majesty
's
service
.
    
<EOS>
thus
disappoint
in
his
endeavour
,
he
return
to
the
inn
,
and
,
with
much
persuasion
,
trust
himself
in
my
dining
-
room
,
after
have
station
his
attendant
at
the
door
,
in
case
of
accident
.
<EOS>
when
I
ask
,
what
have
procure
me
the
honour
of
this
visit
;
he
tell
me
,
his
business
and
intention
be
to
carry
me
home
;
and
this
declaration
produce
a
conference
,
in
which
I
argue
the
case
with
him
;
and
matter
be
accommodate
for
the
present
,
by
my
promising
to
be
in
England
some
time
in
September
,
on
condition
that
he
would
permit
me
to
live
by
myself
,
as
before
,
and
immediately
order
the
arrear
of
my
pin
-
money
to
be
pay
.
<EOS>
He
assent
to
every
thing
I
propose
,
return
in
peace
to
his
own
country
,
and
the
deficiency
of
my
allowance
be
make
good
;
while
I
return
to
Brussels
,
where
I
stay
until
my
departure
for
England
,
which
I
regulate
in
such
a
manner
as
be
consistent
with
my
engagement
.
    
<EOS>
I
take
lodging
in
Pall
-
mall
,
and
send
for
my
lord
,
convince
him
of
my
punctuality
,
and
put
him
in
mind
of
his
promise
;
when
,
to
my
utter
astonishment
and
confusion
,
he
own
,
that
his
promise
be
no
more
than
a
decoy
to
bring
me
over
,
and
that
I
must
lay
my
account
with
live
in
his
house
,
like
a
dutiful
and
obedient
wife
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
with
the
indignation
such
treatment
deserve
,
upbraid
him
with
his
perfidious
dealing
,
which
I
tell
him
would
have
determine
me
against
cohabitation
with
him
,
have
I
not
be
already
resolve
:
and
be
destitute
of
all
resource
,
repair
to
Bath
,
where
I
afterwards
meet
with
Mr
D
#
#
#
#
and
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
,
two
gentleman
who
have
be
my
fellow
-
passenger
in
the
yacht
from
Flanders
,
and
treat
me
with
great
friendship
and
politeness
,
without
either
talk
or
thinking
of
love
.
    
<EOS>
with
these
gentleman
,
who
be
as
idle
as
myself
,
I
go
to
the
jubilee
at
Preston
,
which
be
no
other
than
a
great
number
of
people
assemble
in
a
small
town
extremely
ill
accommodate
,
to
partake
of
diversion
that
be
bad
imitation
of
play
,
concert
,
and
masquerade
.
<EOS>
if
the
world
should
place
to
the
account
of
my
indiscretion
,
my
travelling
in
this
manner
,
with
gentleman
to
whom
I
have
no
particular
attachment
;
let
it
also
be
consider
,
as
an
alleviation
,
that
I
always
live
in
terror
of
my
lord
,
and
consequently
be
often
oblige
to
shift
my
quarter
;
so
that
my
finance
be
extremely
slend
,
I
stand
the
more
in
need
of
assistance
and
protection
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
,
besides
,
young
,
inconsiderate
,
and
so
simple
,
as
to
suppose
the
figure
of
an
ugly
man
would
always
secure
me
from
censure
on
his
account
:
<EOS>
neither
do
I
ever
dream
of
any
man
's
address
,
until
he
make
an
actual
declaration
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
upon
my
return
to
Bath
,
I
be
again
harrasse
by
lord
  
,
who
come
thither
accompany
by
my
father
,
whom
I
be
very
glad
to
see
,
though
he
importune
me
to
comply
with
my
husband
's
desire
,
and
for
the
future
keep
measure
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
this
remonstrance
about
live
with
my
lord
,
which
he
constantly
repeat
,
be
the
only
instance
of
his
unkindness
which
I
ever
feel
.
<EOS>
but
all
his
admonition
be
not
of
force
sufficient
to
shake
my
resolution
in
that
particular
;
though
the
debate
continue
so
late
,
that
I
tell
his
lordship
,
it
be
high
time
to
retire
,
for
I
could
not
accommodate
him
with
a
bed
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
would
stay
where
he
be
;
upon
which
my
father
take
his
leave
,
on
pretence
of
look
out
for
a
lodging
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
the
little
gentleman
be
now
leave
tte
a
tte
with
me
,
begin
to
discover
some
sign
of
apprehension
in
his
look
;
but
muster
up
all
his
resolution
,
he
go
to
the
door
,
call
up
three
of
his
servant
,
whom
he
place
as
centinel
upon
the
stair
,
and
fling
himself
in
my
elbow
-
chair
,
where
he
resign
himself
to
rest
.
<EOS>
intend
to
go
to
bed
,
I
think
it
be
<EOS>
but
just
and
decent
that
I
should
screen
myself
from
the
intrusion
of
his
footman
,
and
with
that
view
bolt
the
door
.
<EOS>
Lord
   
hear
himself
lock
in
,
start
up
in
the
utmost
terror
and
consternation
,
kick
the
door
with
his
heel
,
and
scream
aloud
,
as
if
he
have
be
in
the
hand
of
an
assassin
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
have
not
yet
quit
the
house
,
hear
these
outcry
,
run
up
stair
again
,
and
come
through
my
bed
-
chamber
,
into
the
dining
-
room
where
we
be
,
find
me
almost
suffocate
with
laughter
,
and
his
heroic
son
-
in
-
law
stare
like
one
who
have
lose
his
wit
,
with
his
hair
stand
on
end
.
    
<EOS>
when
my
father
ask
the
meaning
of
his
exclamation
,
he
tell
him
with
all
the
symptom
of
dismay
,
that
I
have
lock'd
him
in
,
and
he
do
not
understand
such
usage
:
but
I
explain
the
whole
mystery
,
by
say
,
I
have
bolt
the
door
,
because
I
do
not
like
the
company
of
his
servant
,
and
could
not
imagine
the
cause
of
his
pannic
,
unless
he
think
I
design
to
ravish
him
;
an
insult
,
than
which
nothing
be
farth
from
my
intention
.
<EOS>
My
father
himself
could
scarce
refrain
from
laugh
at
his
ridiculous
fear
;
but
see
him
in
great
confusion
,
take
pity
on
his
condition
,
and
carry
him
off
to
his
own
lodging
,
after
I
have
give
my
word
,
that
I
would
not
attempt
to
escape
,
but
give
him
audience
next
morning
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
keep
my
promise
,
and
find
mean
to
persuade
them
to
leave
me
at
my
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
I
be
rally
upon
the
stratagem
I
have
contrive
to
frighten
lord
  
;
and
a
thousand
idle
story
be
tell
about
this
adventure
,
which
happen
literally
as
I
have
relate
it
.
    
<EOS>
from
Bath
I
betook
myself
to
a
small
house
near
Lincoln
,
which
I
hire
of
the
d

of
a

because
a
country
life
suit
best
with
my
income
,
which
be
no
more
than
four
hundred
pound
a
year
,
and
that
not
well
pay
.
    
<EOS>
I
continue
some
month
in
this
retirement
,
and
see
no
company
,
except
lord
R

M

who
live
in
the
neighbourhood

and
visit
me
twice

till
find
myself
indisposed

I
be
oblige
to
remove
to
London
,
and
take
lodging
in
Maddox

and

<EOS>
this

drag

down
stair
,
without
glove
or
a
cloak
,
and
thrust
me
into
a
coach
that
stand
at
the
door
,
convey
me
to
my
lord
's
lodging
in
Gloucester
-
street
.
    
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
,
his
lordship
courageously
draw
his
sword
upon
my
woman
,
who
attempt
to
defend
me
from
his
insult
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
intimidate
him
from
proceed
;
for
he
look
pale
and
aghast
,
his
knee
knock
together
,
and
he
breathe
thick
and
hard
,
with
his
nostril
dilate
,
as
if
he
have
see
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
encourage
by
his
mercenary
associate
,
who
,
for
the
five
and
twenty
pound
,
stand
by
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
spirit
him
on
to
this
gallant
enterprize
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
exploit
,
I
be
coope
up
in
a
paultry
apartment
in
Gloucester
-
street
,
where
I
be
close
beset
by
his
lordship
,
and
his
worthy
steward
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
,
with
a
set
of
servant
that
be
the
creature
of
this
fellow
,
of
whom
lord
   
himself
stand
in
awe
;
so
that
I
could
not
help
think
myself
in
Newgate
,
among
thief
and
ruffian
:
and
to
such
a
degree
<EOS>
do
my
terror
prevail
,
that
I
actually
believe
I
be
in
danger
of
be
poison
,
and
would
not
receive
any
sustenance
,
except
from
the
hand
of
one
harmless
-
look
fellow
,
a
foreigner
,
who
be
my
lord
's
valet
de
chambre
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
my
fear
be
just
;
but
such
be
my
opinion
of
H####n
,
that
I
never
doubt
he
would
put
me
out
of
the
way
,
if
he
think
my
life
interfere
with
his
interest
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
of
my
imprisonment
,
I
be
visit
by
the
duke
of
l
#
#
#
#
,
a
friend
of
my
lord
,
who
find
me
sit
upon
a
trunk
,
in
a
poor
little
dining
-
room
fill
with
lumber
,
and
light
with
two
bit
of
tallow
-
candle
,
which
have
be
leave
over
night
.
<EOS>
He
perceive
in
my
countenance
a
mixture
of
rage
,
indignation
,
terror
and
despair
:
he
compassionate
my
suffering
,
though
he
could
not
alleviate
my
distress
,
any
other
way
than
by
intercede
with
my
tyrant
to
mitigate
my
oppression
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
remain
eleven
day
in
this
comfortable
situation
:
I
be
watch
like
a
criminal
all
day
,
and
one
of
the
servant
walk
from
one
room
to
another
all
night
,
in
the
nature
of
a
patrole
;
while
my
lord
,
who
lie
in
the
chamber
above
me
,
get
out
of
bed
,
and
tripp'd
<EOS>
to
the
window
,
at
the
sound
of
every
coach
that
chance
to
pass
through
the
street
.
<EOS>
H####n
,
who
be
consummate
in
the
art
of
a
sycophant
,
begin
to
court
my
favour
,
by
condole
my
affliction
,
and
assure
me
,
that
the
only
method
by
which
I
could
regain
my
liberty
,
be
a
chearful
compliance
with
the
humour
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
be
fully
convince
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
;
and
though
my
temper
be
altogether
averse
to
dissimulation
,
attempt
to
affect
an
air
of
serenity
and
resignation
.
<EOS>
but
this
disguise
,
I
find
,
would
not
answer
my
purpose
;
and
therefore
I
have
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
my
maid
,
who
be
permit
to
attend
me
in
my
confinement
.
    
<EOS>
with
her
I
frequently
consult
about
the
mean
of
accomplish
my
escape
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
our
deliberation
,
she
direct
a
coach
and
six
to
be
ready
at
a
certain
part
of
the
town
,
and
to
wait
for
me
three
day
in
the
same
place
,
in
case
I
could
not
come
before
the
expiration
of
that
term
.
    
<EOS>
this
previous
measure
be
take
accord
to
my
instruction
,
the
next
necessary
step
be
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
my
guard
:
and
in
this
manner
do
I
effectuate
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
be
,
by
this
time
,
indulge
in
the
liberty
of
go
out
in
the
coach
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
,
attend
by
two
footman
,
who
have
order
to
watch
all
my
motion
,
I
make
use
of
this
privilege
one
forenoon
,
when
lord
   
expect
some
company
to
dinner
,
and
bad
the
coachman
drive
to
the
lodging
of
a
man
who
write
with
his
mouth
,
intend
to
give
my
spy
the
slip
,
on
pretence
of
see
this
curiosity
:
but
they
be
too
alert
in
their
duty
to
be
thus
outwit
,
and
follow
me
up
stair
into
the
very
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
disappoint
in
this
hope
,
I
revolve
another
scheme
,
which
be
attend
with
success
:
I
buy
some
olive
at
an
oil
-
shop
;
and
tell
the
servant
I
would
proceed
to
St
James
's
gate
,
and
take
a
turn
in
the
park
,
break
one
of
the
bottle
by
the
way
,
complain
of
the
misfortune
when
I
be
set
down
,
and
desire
that
my
coach
may
be
clean
before
my
return
.
<EOS>
while
my
attendant
be
employ
in
this
office
,
I
tripp'd
<EOS>
across
the
parade
to
the
horse
-
guard
,
and
chance
to
meet
with
an
acquaintance
in
the
park
,
who
say
,
he
see
by
my
countenance
,
that
I
be
upon
some
expedition
.
<EOS>
I
own
his
supposition
be
just
;
but
,
as
I
have
not
time
to
relate
particular
,
I
quicken
my
pace
,
and
take
possession
of
a
hackney
-
coach
,
in
which
I
proceed
to
the
vehicle
which
I
have
appoint
to
be
in
waiting
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
thus
compass
my
escape
,
there
be
nothing
but
perplexity
and
confusion
at
home
;
dinner
be
delay
till
six
o'clock
;
my
lord
run
half
over
the
town
in
quest
of
his
equipage
,
which
at
last
return
,
with
an
account
of
my
elopement
.
<EOS>
My
maid
be
bring
to
the
question
,
and
grievously
threaten
;
but
(
like
all
the
woman
I
ever
have
)
remain
unshaken
in
her
fidelity
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
travel
night
and
day
towards
my
retreat
in
Lincolnshire
,
of
which
his
lordship
have
not
,
as
yet
,
get
the
least
intelligence
;
and
as
my
coachman
be
but
an
unexperienced
driver
,
I
be
oblige
to
make
use
of
my
own
skill
in
that
exercise
,
and
direct
his
endeavour
the
whole
way
,
without
venture
to
go
to
bed
,
or
take
the
least
repose
,
until
I
reach
my
own
habitation
,
where
I
live
in
peace
and
tranquillity
for
the
space
of
six
week
,
when
I
be
alarm
by
one
of
my
lord
's
myrmidon
,
who
come
into
the
neighbourhood
,
blustering
and
swearing
,
that
he
would
carry
me
off
,
either
dead
or
alive
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
I
be
perfectly
easy
,
when
I
be
make
acquainted
with
his
purpose
and
declaration
,
as
my
whole
family
consist
of
no
more
than
a
couple
of
woman
and
one
footman
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
summon
up
my
courage
,
which
have
be
often
try
,
and
never
forsook
me
in
the
day
of
danger
;
and
send
him
word
,
that
if
ever
he
should
presume
to
approach
my
house
,
I
would
order
him
to
be
shoot
,
without
ceremony
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
do
not
choose
to
put
me
to
the
trial
,
and
return
to
town
without
his
errand
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
place
of
my
abode
be
now
discover
,
I
lay
my
account
with
have
a
visit
from
his
employer
:
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
plant
spy
upon
the
road
,
with
a
promise
of
reward
to
him
who
should
bring
me
the
first
intelligence
of
his
lordship
's
approach
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
be
one
morning
apprize
of
his
come
;
and
mount
horse
immediately
,
with
my
woman
and
valet
,
away
we
ride
,
in
defiance
of
winter
,
and
in
two
day
get
through
the
wild
of
Lincolnshire
and
hundred
of
Essex
,
cross
the
river
at
Tilbury
,
breakfast
at
Chatham
,
by
the
help
of
a
guide
and
moon
-
light
,
arrive
at
Dover
the
same
evening
,
and
embark
for
Calais
,
in
which
place
I
find
myself
next
day
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
be
heartily
tired
with
my
journey
,
betook
myself
to
rest
.
<EOS>
My
maid
,
who
be
not
able
to
travel
with
such
expedition
,
follow
me
at
an
easy
pace
;
and
the
footman
be
so
astonished
at
my
perseverance
,
that
he
could
not
help
ask
upon
the
road
,
if
ever
I
be
weary
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
my
spirit
and
resolution
have
enable
me
to
undergo
fatigue
that
be
almost
incredible
.
<EOS>
from
Calais
I
go
to
Brussels
,
where
I
again
set
up
my
rest
in
private
lodging
;
be
again
perfectly
well
receive
by
the
fashionable
people
of
that
place
;
and
,
by
the
interest
of
my
friend
,
obtain
the
queen
of
Hungary
's
protection
against
the
persecution
of
my
husband
,
while
I
should
reside
in
the
Austrian
Netherlands
.
    
<EOS>
thus
secure
,
I
live
uncensured
,
converse
with
the
english
company
,
with
which
this
city
be
croude
,
but
spend
the
most
agreeable
part
of
my
time
with
the
countess
of
Calemberg
,
in
whose
house
I
generally
dine
and
sup
;
and
I
also
contract
an
intimacy
with
the
princess
of
Chemay
,
who
be
a
great
favourite
with
Madam
D'Harrach
,
the
governor
's
lady
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
long
in
this
happy
situation
,
when
I
be
disturb
by
the
arrival
of
lord
  
,
who
demand
me
of
the
governor
;
but
find
me
sheltered
from
his
power
,
he
set
out
for
Vienna
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
his
representation
,
strengthen
with
the
duke
of

withdraw
.
<EOS>
but
,
before
this
application
,
he
have
go
to
the
camp
,
and
address
himself
to
my
lord
Stair
,
who
be
my
particular
friend
,
and
ally
by
my
first
marriage
,
desire
he
would
compel
me
to
return
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
tell
him
,
that
I
be
in
no
shape
subject
to
his
command
;
but
invite
him
to
dinner
,
with
a
view
of
divert
himself
and
company
,
at
the
expence
of
his
guest
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
he
be
ply
with
so
many
bumper
to
my
health
,
that
he
become
intoxicated
,
and
extremely
obstreperous
,
insist
upon
see
lord
Stair
,
after
he
be
retire
to
rest
,
and
quarrel
with
lord
D

,
who
be
a
tall
,
large
,
raw
-
boned
Scotchman
,
could
have
swallow
him
at
one
mouthful
;
but
he
think
he
may
venture
to
challenge
him
,
in
hope
of
be
put
under
arrest
by
the
general
:
though
he
reckon
without
his
host
;
lord
Stair
know
his
disposition
,
and
,
in
order
to
punish
his
presumption
,
wink
at
the
affair
.
<EOS>
the
challenger
,
find
himself
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
,
get
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
go
off
post
for
Vienna
:
and
lord
Stair
desire
a
certain
man
of
quality
to
make
me
a
visit
,
and
give
me
an
account
of
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
be
now
deprive
of
my
protection
and
pin
-
money
,
which
my
generous
husband
would
no
longer
pay
,
I
be
reduce
to
great
difficulty
and
distress
.
    
<EOS>
the
duchess
D'Aremberg
,
lord
G
#
#
#

,
and
many
other
person
of
distinction
,
intercede
in
my
behalf
with
his
majesty
,
who
be
then
abroad
;
<EOS>
but
he
refuse
to
interpose
between
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
the
countess
of
Calemberg
write
a
letter
to
my
father
,
in
which
she
represent
my
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
undertake
to
answer
for
my
conduct
,
in
case
he
would
allow
me
a
small
annuity
,
on
which
I
could
live
independant
of
lord
  
,
who
,
by
all
account
,
be
a
wretch
with
whom
I
could
never
enjoy
the
least
happiness
or
quiet
;
otherwise
,
she
would
be
the
first
to
advise
me
to
an
accommodation
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
to
understand
,
that
her
character
be
neither
doubtful
nor
obscure
;
and
that
if
my
conduct
there
have
not
be
irreproachable
,
she
should
not
have
take
me
under
her
protection
:
that
as
I
propose
to
board
in
a
convent
,
a
small
sum
would
answer
my
occasion
;
but
,
if
that
should
be
deny
,
I
would
actually
go
to
service
,
or
take
some
other
desperate
step
,
to
avoid
the
man
who
be
my
bane
and
aversion
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
kind
remonstrance
my
father
answer
,
that
his
fortune
would
not
allow
him
to
assist
me
;
he
have
now
a
young
family
;
and
that
I
ought
,
at
all
event
,
to
return
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
such
be
the
extremity
of
my
circumstance
,
that
I
be
force
to
pawn
my
cloath
,
and
every
trifling
trinket
in
my
possession
,
and
even
to
descend
so
far
as
to
sollicit
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
for
a
loan
of
fifty
pound
,
which
he
refuse
.
    
<EOS>
thus
be
I
desert
,
in
my
distress
,
by
two
person
,
to
whom
,
in
the
season
of
my
affluence
,
my
purse
have
be
always
open
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
so
effectually
subdue
a
spirit
unused
to
supplicate
,
as
want
:
repulse
in
this
manner
,
I
have
recourse
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
also
(
it
seem
)
unable
to
relieve
my
necessity
.
<EOS>
this
mortification
I
deserve
at
his
hand
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
have
once
put
it
in
my
power
to
be
above
all
such
paultry
demand
;
and
I
should
not
have
be
compel
to
the
disagreeable
task
of
trouble
my
friend
,
have
not
I
voluntarily
resign
what
he
formerly
give
me
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
gentleman
to
whom
I
address
myself
,
on
this
occasion
,
I
think
he
may
have
shew
more
regard
to
my
application
,
not
only
for
the
reason
already
mention
,
but
because
he
know
me
too
well
to
be
ignorant
of
what
I
must
have
suffer
,
in
condescend
to
make
such
a
request
.
    
<EOS>
several
officer
,
who
guess'd
my
adversity
,
generously
offer
to
supply
me
with
money
;
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
make
use
of
their
friendship
,
or
even
to
own
my
distress
,
except
to
one
person
,
of
whom
I
borrow
a
small
sum
.
<EOS>
to
crown
my
misfortune
,
I
be
take
very
ill
,
at
a
time
when
there
be
no
other
way
of
avoid
the
clutch
of
my
persecutor
,
but
by
a
precipitate
flight
.
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
,
I
apply
to
a
worthy
gentleman
of
Brussels
,
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
,
but
no
lover
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
lover
,
because
every
man
be
suppose
to
act
in
that
capacity
who
befriend
a
young
woman
in
distress
.
<EOS>
this
generous
Fleming
set
out
with
me
,
in
the
night
,
from
Brussels
,
and
conduct
me
to
the
frontier
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
be
very
much
indispose
both
in
mind
and
body
when
I
be
oblige
to
undertake
this
expedition
,
I
should
,
in
all
probability
,
have
sink
under
the
fatigue
of
travelling
,
have
not
my
spirit
be
keep
up
by
the
conversation
of
my
companion
,
who
be
a
man
of
business
and
consequence
,
and
undertake
to
manage
my
affair
in
such
a
manner
as
would
enable
me
to
re
-
establish
my
residence
in
the
place
I
have
leave
.
<EOS>
He
be
young
and
active
,
attend
me
with
the
utmost
care
and
assiduity
,
and
leave
nothing
undone
which
he
think
would
contribute
to
my
ease
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
believe
his
friendship
for
me
be
a
little
tincture
with
another
passion
;
but
he
be
married
,
and
live
very
well
with
his
wife
,
who
be
also
my
friend
;
so
that
he
know
I
would
never
think
of
him
in
the
light
of
a
lover
.
    
<EOS>
upon
our
arrival
at
Valenciennes
,
he
accommodate
me
with
a
little
money
(
for
a
little
be
all
I
would
take
)
and
return
to
his
own
city
,
after
we
have
settle
a
correspondence
by
letter
.
<EOS>
I
be
detain
a
day
or
two
in
this
place
by
my
indisposition
,
which
increase
;
but
nevertheless
proceed
to
Paris
,
to
make
interest
for
a
protection
from
the
king
of
France
,
which
that
monarch
graciously
accord
me
,
in
three
day
after
my
first
application
;
and
his
minister
send
order
to
all
the
governor
and
intendant
of
the
province
town
,
to
protect
me
against
the
effort
of
lord
  
,
in
whatever
place
I
should
choose
to
reside
.
    
<EOS>
have
return
my
thank
at
Versailles
for
this
favour
,
and
tarry
a
few
day
at
Paris
,
which
be
a
place
altogether
unsuitable
to
the
low
ebb
of
my
fortune
,
I
repair
to
Lisle
,
where
I
intend
to
fix
my
habitation
;
and
there
my
disorder
recur
with
such
violence
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
send
for
a
physician
,
who
seem
to
have
be
a
disciple
of
Sangrado
;
for
he
scarce
leave
a
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
,
and
yet
I
find
myself
never
a
whit
the
well
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
so
much
exhaust
by
these
evacuation
,
and
my
constitution
so
much
impair
by
fatigue
and
perturbation
of
mind
<EOS>
,
that
I
have
no
other
hope
of
recover
but
<EOS>
that
of
reach
England
,
and
put
myself
under
the
direction
of
a
physician
on
whose
ability
I
could
depend
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
doubtful
prospect
,
therefore
,
I
determine
to
attempt
a
return
to
my
native
air
,
and
actually
depart
from
Lisle
,
in
such
a
melancholy
enfeeble
condition
,
that
I
have
almost
faint
when
I
be
put
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
but
before
I
resolve
upon
this
journey
I
be
reduce
to
the
utmost
exigence
of
fortune
;
so
that
I
could
scarce
afford
to
buy
provision
,
have
it
be
in
my
power
to
eat
,
and
should
not
have
be
able
to
defray
my
travelling
expence
,
have
I
not
be
generously
befriend
by
lord
R
#
#
#
#
M
#
#
#
#
who
(
I
be
sure
)
would
have
do
any
thing
for
my
ease
and
accommodation
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
have
unjustly
incur
the
imputation
of
be
parsimonious
,
and
I
have
no
reason
to
expect
any
such
favour
at
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
deplorable
state
of
health
I
be
convey
to
Calais
,
be
all
the
way
(
as
it
be
)
in
the
arm
of
death
,
without
have
swallow
the
least
sustenance
on
the
road
;
and
so
much
be
my
indisposition
augment
by
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
,
that
I
swoon
when
I
be
bring
into
the
inn
,
and
have
almost
expire
before
I
could
receive
the
least
assistance
or
advice
:
<EOS>
however
,
my
spirit
be
a
little
revive
by
some
bread
and
wine
,
which
I
take
at
the
persuasion
of
a
french
surgeon
,
who
chance
to
pass
by
the
door
,
be
call
up
to
my
relief
;
and
have
send
my
servant
to
Brussels
to
take
care
of
my
cloath
,
embark
in
the
packet
-
boat
,
and
by
that
time
we
arrive
at
Dover
,
be
almost
in
extremity
.
    
<EOS>
here
I
find
a
return
coach
,
in
which
I
be
carry
to
London
,
and
be
put
to
bed
in
the
house
at
which
we
put
up
,
more
dead
than
alive
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
inn
send
for
an
apothecary
,
who
administre
some
cordial
that
recall
me
to
life
;
and
when
I
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
I
tell
him
who
I
be
,
and
desire
him
to
wait
upon
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
and
inform
him
of
my
situation
.
<EOS>
a
young
girl
who
be
niece
to
the
landlord
's
wife
,
see
me
unattended
,
make
a
tender
of
her
service
to
me
,
and
I
accept
the
offer
,
as
well
as
of
a
lodging
in
the
apothecary
's
house
,
to
which
I
be
convey
as
soon
as
my
strength
would
admit
of
my
removal
;
and
there
be
visit
by
my
physician
,
who
be
shocked
to
find
me
in
such
a
dangerous
condition
:
however
,
have
consider
my
case
,
he
perceive
that
my
indisposition
proceed
from
the
calamity
I
have
undergo
,
and
encourage
me
with
the
hope
of
a
speedy
cure
,
<EOS>
provide
I
could
be
keep
easy
and
undisturbed
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
accordingly
tended
with
all
imaginable
care
;
my
lord
's
name
be
never
mention
in
my
hearing
,
because
I
consider
him
as
the
fatal
source
of
all
my
misfortune
;
and
in
a
month
I
recover
my
health
,
by
the
great
skill
and
tenderness
of
my
doctor
,
who
now
find
me
strong
enough
to
encounter
fresh
trouble
,
endeavour
to
persuade
me
,
that
it
would
be
my
wise
step
to
return
to
my
husband
,
whom
,
at
that
time
,
he
have
often
occasion
to
see
.
<EOS>
but
I
reject
his
proposal
,
commence
a
new
lawsuit
for
separation
,
and
take
a
small
house
in
St
James
's
Square
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
my
woman
return
from
Brussels
,
but
without
my
cloath
,
which
be
detain
on
account
of
the
money
I
owe
in
that
place
;
and
ask
her
dismission
from
my
service
,
set
up
shop
for
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
live
many
week
in
my
new
habitation
,
when
my
persecutor
renew
his
attempt
to
make
himself
master
of
my
person
;
but
I
have
learn'd
from
experience
,
to
redouble
my
vigilance
,
and
he
be
frustrate
in
all
his
endeavour
.
<EOS>
I
be
again
happy
in
the
conversation
of
my
former
acquaintance
,
and
visit
by
a
great
number
of
gentleman
,
mostly
person
of
probity
and
sense
,
who
cultivate
my
friendship
,
without
any
other
motive
of
attachment
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
be
unsolicited
on
the
article
of
love
;
that
be
a
theme
on
which
I
never
want
orator
;
and
could
I
have
prevail
upon
myself
to
profit
by
the
advance
that
be
make
,
I
may
have
manage
my
opportunity
,
so
as
to
have
set
fortune
at
defiance
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
none
of
those
oeconomist
,
who
can
sacrifice
their
heart
to
interested
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
one
evening
,
while
I
be
converse
with
three
or
four
of
my
friend
,
my
lawyer
come
in
,
and
tell
me
he
have
something
of
consequence
to
impart
:
upon
which
,
all
the
gentleman
but
one
go
away
;
and
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
my
suit
would
immediately
come
to
trial
;
and
though
he
hope
the
good
,
the
issue
be
uncertain
:
that
if
it
should
be
give
against
me
,
the
decision
would
inspire
my
lord
with
fresh
spirit
to
disturb
my
peace
;
and
therefore
it
would
be
convenient
for
me
to
retire
,
until
the
affair
should
be
bring
to
a
determination
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
disconcert
at
this
intelligence
;
and
the
gentleman
who
stay
perceive
my
concern
,
ask
what
I
intend
to
do
,
or
if
he
could
serve
me
in
any
shape
,
and
desire
to
know
whither
I
propose
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
affect
to
laugh
,
and
answer
,
"
to
a
garret
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
over
-
strain
raillery
he
reply
,
that
if
I
should
,
his
friendship
and
regard
would
find
the
way
to
my
apartment
;
and
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
declaration
.
<EOS>
We
consult
about
the
measure
I
should
take
,
and
I
determine
to
remove
into
the
country
,
where
I
be
soon
favour
with
a
letter
from
him
,
wherein
he
express
the
infinite
pleasure
he
have
,
in
be
able
to
assure
me
,
that
my
suit
have
be
successful
,
and
that
I
may
appear
again
with
great
safety
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
return
to
town
in
his
coach
and
six
,
which
he
have
send
for
my
convenience
,
and
the
same
evening
go
with
him
to
the
masquerade
,
where
we
pass
the
night
very
agreeably
,
his
spirit
,
as
well
as
mine
,
be
elevate
to
a
joyous
pitch
,
by
the
happy
event
of
my
process
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
a
person
of
great
honour
,
worth
and
good
nature
;
he
love
me
extremely
,
but
do
not
care
that
I
should
know
the
extent
of
his
passion
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
endeavour
to
persuade
me
,
he
have
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
,
that
no
woman
should
ever
have
power
enough
over
his
heart
,
to
give
him
the
least
pain
or
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
have
make
a
progress
in
my
affection
,
and
to
his
generosity
be
I
indebted
for
my
subsistence
two
whole
year
;
during
which
,
he
be
continually
profess
this
philosophic
indifference
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
be
give
me
daily
assurance
of
his
friendship
and
esteem
,
and
treat
me
with
incessant
mark
of
the
most
passionate
love
:
<EOS>
so
that
I
conclude
his
intention
be
cold
,
though
his
temper
be
warm
;
and
consider
myself
as
an
incumbrance
upon
his
fortune
,
I
redouble
my
endeavour
to
obtain
a
separate
maintenance
from
my
lord
,
and
remove
from
St
James
's
Square
to
lodging
at
Kensington
,
where
I
have
not
long
enjoy
myself
in
tranquillity
,
before
it
be
interrupt
by
a
very
unexpected
visit
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
be
busy
one
day
dress
in
my
dining
-
room
,
I
find
his
lordship
at
my
elbow
,
before
I
be
aware
of
his
approach
,
although
his
coach
be
at
the
door
,
and
the
house
already
in
the
possession
of
his
servant
.
<EOS>
He
accost
me
in
the
usual
stile
,
as
if
we
have
part
the
night
before
;
and
I
answer
him
with
an
appearance
of
the
same
careless
familiarity
,
desire
him
to
sit
down
,
while
I
retreat
to
my
chamber
,
<EOS>
lock'd
<EOS>
the
door
,
and
fairly
go
to
bed
;
being
,
perhaps
,
the
first
woman
who
go
thither
for
protection
from
the
insult
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
here
then
I
immure
myself
with
my
faithful
Abigail
;
and
my
lord
find
me
secure
,
knock
at
the
door
,
and
through
the
key
-
hole
begg'd
to
be
admit
;
assure
me
,
that
all
he
want
be
a
conference
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
be
excuse
,
though
I
believe
his
assurance
;
but
I
have
no
inclination
to
converse
with
him
,
because
I
know
from
experience
the
nature
of
his
conversation
,
which
be
so
disagreeable
and
torment
,
that
I
would
have
exchange
it
at
any
time
for
a
good
beating
,
and
think
myself
a
gainer
by
the
bargain
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
he
persist
in
his
importunity
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
assent
to
his
proposal
,
on
condition
that
the
duke
of
l
#
#
#
#
should
be
present
at
the
interview
;
and
he
immediately
send
a
message
to
his
grace
,
while
I
in
peace
eat
my
breakfast
,
convey
in
a
basket
,
which
be
hoist
up
to
the
window
of
my
bed
-
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
the
duke
be
so
kind
as
to
come
at
my
lord
's
request
,
and
before
I
would
open
the
door
,
give
me
his
word
,
that
I
should
be
protect
from
all
violence
and
compulsion
.
<EOS>
thus
assure
,
they
be
permit
to
enter
;
and
my
little
gentleman
sit
down
by
the
bed
-
side
,
begin
to
repeat
the
old
hackneyed
argument
he
have
formerly
use
,
with
the
view
of
induce
me
to
live
with
him
;
and
I
,
on
my
side
,
repeat
my
former
objection
,
or
pretend
to
listen
to
his
representation
,
while
my
imagination
be
employ
in
contrive
the
mean
of
effect
an
escape
,
as
the
duke
easily
perceive
by
my
countenance
.
    
<EOS>
find
all
his
remonstrance
ineffectual
,
he
quit
the
chamber
,
and
leave
his
cause
to
the
eloquence
of
his
grace
,
who
sit
with
me
a
whole
half
hour
,
without
exert
himself
much
in
behalf
of
his
client
,
because
he
know
I
be
altogether
obstinate
,
and
determine
on
that
score
;
but
joke
upon
the
behaviour
of
his
lordship
,
who
(
though
jealous
of
most
people
)
have
leave
him
alone
with
me
in
my
bed
-
chamber
,
observe
,
that
he
must
either
have
great
confidence
in
his
virtue
,
or
a
very
bad
opinion
of
him
otherwise
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
find
mean
to
defer
the
categorical
answer
till
next
day
,
and
invite
the
duke
and
his
lordship
to
dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
My
wife
yoke
-
fellow
seem
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
this
invitation
,
and
be
very
much
disposed
to
keep
possession
of
my
fort
:
but
,
by
the
persuasion
of
his
grace
,
and
the
advice
of
H####n
,
who
be
his
chief
counsellor
and
back
,
he
be
prevail
upon
to
take
my
word
,
and
for
the
present
leave
me
.
    
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
retire
,
than
I
rise
with
great
expedition
,
pack'd
<EOS>
up
my
cloath
,
and
take
shelter
in
Essex
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
my
lord
and
his
noble
friend
come
to
dinner
,
accord
to
appointment
;
and
be
inform
of
my
escape
by
my
woman
,
whom
I
have
leave
in
the
house
,
his
lordship
discover
some
sign
of
discontent
,
and
insist
upon
see
my
paper
;
upon
which
,
my
maid
produce
a
parcel
of
bill
which
I
owe
to
different
people
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
disappointment
,
he
sit
down
to
what
be
provide
for
dinner
,
and
with
great
deliberation
eat
up
a
leg
of
lamb
,
the
good
part
of
a
fowl
,
and
something
else
,
which
I
do
not
now
remember
;
and
then
very
peaceably
go
away
,
give
my
maid
an
opportunity
of
follow
me
to
the
place
of
my
retreat
.
    
<EOS>
My
intention
be
to
have
seek
refuge
,
as
formerly
,
in
another
country
;
but
I
be
prevent
from
put
my
design
in
execution
by
a
fit
of
illness
,
during
which
I
be
visit
by
my
physician
and
some
of
my
own
relation
,
particularly
a
distant
cousin
of
mine
,
whom
my
lord
have
engage
in
his
interest
,
by
promise
to
recompence
her
amply
,
if
she
could
persuade
me
to
comply
with
his
desire
.
<EOS>
in
this
office
she
be
assist
by
the
doctor
,
who
be
my
friend
,
and
a
man
of
sense
,
for
whom
I
have
the
most
perfect
esteem
,
though
he
and
I
have
often
differ
in
point
of
opinion
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
be
expose
to
the
incessant
importunity
of
all
my
acquaintance
,
which
,
add
to
the
desperate
circumstance
of
my
fortune
,
compel
me
to
embrace
the
term
that
be
offer
,
and
I
again
return
to
the
domestic
duty
of
a
wife
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
conduct
to
my
lord
's
house
by
an
old
friend
of
mine
,
a
gentleman
turn
of
fifty
,
of
admirable
part
and
understanding
;
he
be
a
pleasing
companion
,
chearful
and
humane
,
and
have
acquire
a
great
share
of
my
esteem
and
respect
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
his
advice
have
great
weight
in
my
deliberation
,
because
it
seem
to
be
the
result
of
experience
and
disintereste
friendship
.
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
he
have
an
unfeigned
concern
for
my
welfare
;
but
,
be
an
admirable
politician
,
his
scheme
be
to
make
my
interest
coincide
with
his
own
inclination
;
for
I
have
unwittingly
make
an
innovation
upon
his
heart
;
and
as
he
think
I
should
hardly
favour
his
passion
,
while
I
be
at
liberty
to
converse
with
the
rest
of
my
admirer
,
he
counsel
me
to
surrender
that
freedom
,
well
know
that
my
lord
would
be
easily
persuade
to
banish
all
his
rival
from
the
house
;
in
which
case
,
he
do
not
doubt
of
his
be
able
to
insinuate
himself
into
my
affection
;
because
he
lay
it
down
as
an
eternal
truth
,
that
if
any
two
person
of
different
sex
be
oblige
to
live
together
in
a
desart
,
where
they
would
be
exclude
from
all
other
human
intercourse
,
they
would
naturally
and
inevitably
contract
an
inclination
for
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
how
just
this
hypothesis
may
be
,
I
leave
to
the
determination
of
the
curious
;
though
,
if
I
may
be
allow
to
judge
from
my
own
disposition
,
a
couple
so
situated
would
be
apt
to
imbibe
mutual
disgust
,
from
the
nature
and
necessity
of
their
union
;
unless
their
association
be
at
first
the
effect
of
reciprocal
affection
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
I
honour
the
gentleman
man
for
his
plan
,
which
be
ingeniously
contrive
,
and
artfully
conduct
:
but
I
happen
to
have
too
much
address
for
him
in
the
sequel
,
cunne
as
he
be
,
though
at
first
I
do
not
perceive
his
drift
;
and
his
lordship
be
much
less
likely
to
comprehend
his
meaning
.
    
<EOS>
immediately
after
this
new
accommodation
,
I
be
carry
to
a
country
-
house
belong
to
my
lord
,
and
be
simple
enough
to
venture
myself
(
unattende
by
any
servant
on
whose
integrity
I
could
depend
)
in
the
hand
of
his
lordship
and
H####n
,
whose
villainy
I
always
dread
;
tho
'
at
this
time
my
apprehension
be
considerably
increase
,
by
recollect
,
that
it
be
not
his
interest
to
let
me
live
in
the
house
,
lest
his
conduct
should
be
inquire
into
;
and
by
remember
,
that
the
very
house
to
which
we
be
go
,
have
be
twice
burn
down
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
not
without
suspicion
of
his
have
be
the
incendiary
,
on
account
of
some
box
of
writing
,
which
be
lose
in
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
this
imputation
be
never
make
good
;
and
perhaps
he
be
altogether
innocent
of
the
charge
,
which
nevertheless
affect
my
spirit
in
such
a
manner
,
as
render
me
the
most
miserable
of
all
mortal
;
and
in
this
terror
do
I
remain
,
till
my
consternation
be
weaken
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Bal
#
#
#
#
,
a
good
natured
worthy
man
,
whom
my
lord
have
invite
to
his
house
,
and
I
think
would
not
see
me
ill
used
;
and
in
a
few
week
,
we
be
join
by
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
and
his
lady
,
who
visit
us
accord
to
their
promise
;
and
it
be
resolve
that
we
should
set
out
for
Tunbridge
,
on
a
partie
of
pleasure
,
and
at
our
return
examine
H####n
's
account
.
    
<EOS>
this
last
part
of
our
scheme
be
not
all
relish
by
our
worthy
steward
,
who
,
therefore
,
determine
to
overturn
our
whole
plan
,
and
succeed
accordingly
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
declare
himself
against
the
jaunt
we
have
project
,
and
insist
upon
my
staying
at
home
,
without
assign
any
reason
for
this
peremptory
behaviour
;
his
countenance
become
cloudy
,
and
for
the
space
of
three
day
he
do
not
open
his
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
one
night
enter
my
bed
-
chamber
,
to
which
he
now
have
free
access
,
with
his
sword
under
his
arm
,
and
,
if
I
remember
aright
,
it
be
ready
draw
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
take
notice
of
this
alarm
circumstance
,
which
shock
me
the
more
,
as
it
happen
immediately
after
a
gloomy
fit
of
discontent
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
seem
to
overlook
the
incident
,
and
dismiss
my
maid
,
go
to
bed
;
because
I
be
ashamed
to
acknowledge
,
even
to
my
own
heart
,
any
dread
of
a
person
whom
I
despise
so
much
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
strength
of
my
constitution
be
not
equal
to
the
fortitude
of
my
mind
:
<EOS>
I
be
take
ill
,
and
the
servant
be
oblige
to
be
call
up
;
while
my
lord
himself
,
terrify
at
my
situation
,
run
up
stair
to
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
in
bed
,
tell
her
,
with
evident
perturbation
of
spirit
,
that
I
be
very
much
indisposed
,
and
say
,
he
believe
I
be
frightened
by
his
enter
my
chamber
with
his
sword
in
hand
.
    
<EOS>
this
lady
be
so
startled
at
his
information
,
that
she
run
into
my
apartment
half
-
naked
,
and
as
she
go
down
stair
,
ask
what
reason
could
induce
him
to
have
carry
his
sword
with
him
?
<EOS>
upon
which
he
give
her
to
understand
,
that
his
intention
be
to
kill
the
bat
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
and
hope
he
have
no
other
design
than
that
of
intimidate
me
,
but
when
the
affair
happen
,
I
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
have
put
on
her
cloath
,
sit
up
all
night
by
my
bed
-
side
,
and
be
so
good
as
to
assure
me
,
that
she
would
not
leave
me
,
until
I
should
be
safely
deliver
from
the
apprehension
that
surround
me
in
this
house
,
to
which
she
and
the
doctor
have
be
the
principal
cause
of
my
coming
;
for
my
lord
have
haunt
and
importune
them
incessantly
on
this
subject
,
protest
that
he
love
me
with
the
most
inviolable
affection
;
and
all
he
desire
be
,
that
I
would
sit
at
his
table
,
manage
his
family
,
and
share
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
by
these
profession
,
utter
with
an
air
of
honesty
and
good
-
nature
,
he
have
impose
himself
upon
them
,
for
the
good
temper
creature
upon
earth
;
and
they
use
all
their
influence
with
me
to
take
him
into
favour
.
<EOS>
this
hath
be
the
case
with
a
great
many
people
,
who
have
but
a
superficial
knowledge
of
his
disposition
;
but
,
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
,
they
have
never
fail
to
discern
and
acknowledge
their
mistake
.
    
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
his
return
from
Tunbridge
,
to
which
place
he
have
make
a
trip
by
himself
,
find
me
ill
a
-
bed
,
and
the
whole
family
in
confusion
:
surprize
and
concerned
at
this
disorder
,
he
enter
into
expostulation
with
my
lord
,
who
own
,
that
the
cause
of
his
displeasure
and
disquiet
be
no
other
than
jealousy
:
h
#
#
#
#
have
inform
him
,
that
I
have
be
see
to
walk
out
with
Mr
Bal
#
#
#
#
in
a
morning
;
and
that
our
correspondence
have
be
observe
with
many
additional
circumstance
,
which
be
absolutely
false
and
groundless
.
    
<EOS>
this
imputation
be
no
sooner
understand
,
than
it
be
resolve
that
the
accuser
should
be
examine
,
in
presence
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
appear
,
exceedingly
drunk
,
tho
'
<EOS>
it
be
morning
,
and
repeat
the
article
of
the
charge
,
as
an
information
he
have
receive
from
a
man
who
come
from
town
to
hang
the
bell
,
and
be
long
ago
return
to
London
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
an
instance
of
his
cunning
and
address
,
which
do
not
forsake
him
even
in
his
hour
of
intoxication
.
<EOS>
have
he
fix
the
calumny
on
any
one
of
the
servant
,
he
would
have
be
confront
and
detect
in
his
falshood
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
tho
'
he
could
not
be
legally
convict
,
it
plainly
appear
that
he
be
the
author
of
this
defamation
,
which
incense
Mr
Bal
#
#
#
#
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
scarce
be
with
-
hold
from
punish
him
on
the
spot
,
by
manual
chastisement
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
prevail
upon
to
abstain
from
such
immediate
vengeance
,
as
a
step
unworthy
of
his
character
;
and
the
affair
be
bring
to
this
issue
,
that
his
lordship
should
either
part
with
me
or
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
for
I
be
fully
determine
against
live
under
the
same
roof
with
such
an
incendiary
.
    
<EOS>
this
alternative
be
propose
,
my
lord
dismiss'd
<EOS>
his
steward
,
and
we
return
to
town
with
the
doctor
and
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
;
for
I
have
imbibe
such
horror
and
aversion
for
this
country
seat
<EOS>
(
tho
'
one
of
the
pleasantest
in
England
)
that
I
could
not
bear
to
live
in
it
.
    
<EOS>
We
therefore
remove
to
an
house
in
Bond
-
street
,
where
,
accord
to
the
advice
of
my
friend
,
I
exert
my
whole
power
and
complaisance
,
in
endeavour
to
keep
my
husband
in
good
humour
;
but
be
so
unsuccessful
in
my
attempt
,
that
if
ever
he
be
bad
temper
,
more
capricious
,
or
intolerable
,
at
one
time
than
at
another
,
this
be
the
season
in
which
his
ill
-
humour
predominate
to
the
most
rancorous
degree
.
<EOS>
I
be
scarce
ever
permit
to
stir
abroad
,
see
no
-
body
at
home
<EOS>
but
my
old
male
-
friend
whom
I
have
mention
above
,
and
the
doctor
with
his
lady
,
from
whose
conversation
also
I
be
at
last
exclude
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
contrive
to
steal
a
meeting
,
now
and
then
,
with
my
late
benefactor
,
for
whom
I
entertain
a
great
share
of
affection
,
exclusive
of
that
gratitude
which
be
due
to
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
fault
that
I
compromise
matter
with
my
lord
;
for
he
be
as
free
of
his
purse
as
I
be
unwilling
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
therefore
,
have
be
unfriendly
,
unkind
,
and
ungrateful
in
me
(
now
that
I
be
in
affluence
)
to
avoid
all
intercourse
with
a
man
who
have
support
me
in
adversity
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
people
can
not
be
too
shy
and
scrupulous
in
receive
favour
;
but
once
they
be
confer
,
they
ought
never
to
forget
the
obligation
:
and
I
be
never
more
concerned
at
any
incident
of
my
life
,
than
at
hear
that
this
gentleman
do
not
receive
a
letter
,
in
which
I
acknowledge
the
last
proof
of
his
friendship
and
liberality
which
I
have
occasion
to
use
,
because
I
have
since
learn
,
that
he
suspect
me
of
neglect
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
to
return
to
my
situation
in
Bond
-
street
,
I
bear
it
as
well
as
I
could
for
the
space
of
three
month
,
during
which
I
live
in
the
midst
of
spy
who
be
employ
to
watch
my
conduct
;
and
undergo
every
mortification
that
malice
,
power
,
and
folly
could
inflict
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
ridiculous
,
so
unreasonable
be
my
tyrant
in
his
spleen
,
that
he
declare
he
would
even
be
jealous
of
Heydigger
,
if
there
be
no
other
man
to
incur
his
suspicion
<EOS>
:
he
expect
that
I
should
spend
my
whole
time
with
him
,
tte
a
tte
;
and
when
I
sacrifice
my
enjoyment
to
these
comfortable
party
,
he
never
fail
to
lay
hold
on
some
innocent
expression
of
mine
,
which
he
make
the
foundation
of
a
quarrel
;
and
when
I
strove
to
avoid
these
disagreeable
misinterpretation
,
by
read
or
write
,
he
incessantly
teize
and
torment
me
with
the
imputation
of
be
peevish
,
sullen
and
reserved
.
    
<EOS>
harrasse
by
this
insufferable
behaviour
,
I
communicate
my
case
to
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
and
his
lady
,
intimate
that
I
neither
could
nor
would
expose
myself
any
longer
to
such
usage
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
exhort
me
to
bear
my
fate
with
patience
,
and
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
be
silent
on
the
subject
;
so
that
I
still
hesitate
between
stay
and
go
,
when
the
doctor
be
one
night
at
supper
,
happen
to
have
some
word
with
my
lord
,
who
be
so
violently
transport
with
passion
,
that
I
be
actually
afraid
of
go
to
bed
with
him
;
and
next
morning
when
he
wake
,
there
be
such
an
expression
of
frantic
wildness
in
his
countenance
,
<EOS>
that
I
imagine
he
be
actually
distract
.
    
<EOS>
this
alarm
circumstance
confirm
me
in
my
resolution
of
decamp
;
and
I
accordingly
move
my
quarter
to
an
house
in
Sackville
-
street
,
where
I
have
lodge
when
I
be
a
widow
;
and
when
I
be
settle
,
send
a
message
to
the
duke
of
l
#
#
#
#
,
desire
he
would
make
my
lord
acquaint
with
the
place
of
my
abode
,
my
reason
for
remove
,
and
my
intention
to
defend
myself
against
all
his
attempt
.
<EOS>
the
first
night
of
this
separation
I
go
to
bed
by
myself
,
with
as
much
pleasure
as
a
man
could
do
in
go
to
bed
to
his
mistress
,
whom
he
have
long
solicit
in
vain
.
<EOS>
so
rejoice
be
I
to
be
deliver
from
my
obnoxious
bedfellow
!
    
<EOS>
I
have
not
long
change
my
lodging
,
which
I
do
to
brook
-
street
,
and
enjoy
the
sweet
of
my
escape
,
when
I
be
importune
to
return
,
by
a
new
steward
whom
my
lord
have
engage
in
the
room
of
H####n
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
who
bear
a
very
fair
character
,
make
such
judicious
representation
,
and
behave
so
candidly
in
the
discharge
of
his
function
,
that
I
agree
he
should
act
as
umpire
in
the
difference
between
us
;
and
once
more
a
reconciliation
be
effect
,
tho
'
his
lordship
begin
to
be
dissatisfy
even
before
the
execution
of
our
agreement
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
attend
me
to
Bath
,
whither
I
go
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
,
which
be
not
a
little
impaired
.
    
<EOS>
this
accommodation
have
a
surprising
effect
upon
my
lover
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
repeated
declaration
,
that
no
woman
should
ever
gain
such
an
ascendency
over
his
heart
,
as
to
be
able
to
give
him
pain
,
suffer
all
the
agony
of
disappointed
love
,
when
he
now
find
himself
deprive
of
the
opportunity
of
see
me
,
and
behave
very
differently
from
what
he
have
imagine
he
should
:
his
word
and
action
be
desperate
;
one
of
his
expression
to
me
be
,
"
It
be
like
twist
my
heart
-
string
,
and
tear
it
out
of
my
body
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
never
have
do
it
,
<EOS>
have
I
think
he
would
have
suffer
;
but
I
protest
I
believe
him
when
he
say
otherwise
so
much
,
that
it
be
the
occasion
of
my
give
him
up
;
and
it
be
now
too
late
to
retract
.
    
<EOS>
in
our
expedition
to
the
Bath
<EOS>
I
be
accompany
by
a
very
agreeable
young
lady
,
with
whom
I
pass'd
my
time
very
happily
,
amid
the
diversion
of
the
place
,
which
screen
me
,
in
a
good
measure
,
from
the
vexatious
society
of
my
hopeful
partner
.
<EOS>
from
this
place
we
repair
to
his
seat
in
the
country
,
where
we
spend
a
few
month
,
and
thence
return
again
to
our
house
in
Bond
-
street
.
<EOS>
here
,
while
I
be
confine
to
my
bed
by
illness
,
it
be
suppose
my
indisposition
be
no
other
than
a
private
lying
in
<EOS>
,
tho
'
I
be
under
the
roof
with
my
lord
,
and
attend
by
his
servant
.
    
<EOS>
while
my
distemper
continue
,
my
lord
(
to
do
him
justice
)
behave
with
all
imaginable
tenderness
and
care
;
and
his
concern
on
these
occasion
I
have
already
mention
,
as
a
strange
inconsistency
in
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
if
his
action
be
at
all
accountable
,
I
should
think
he
take
pain
to
fret
me
into
a
fever
first
,
in
order
to
manifest
his
love
and
humanity
afterwards
.
<EOS>
when
I
recover
my
strength
and
spirit
,
I
go
abroad
,
see
company
,
and
should
have
be
easy
,
have
he
be
content
;
but
as
my
satisfaction
increase
,
his
good
humour
decay
,
and
he
banish
,
from
his
house
,
one
by
one
,
all
the
people
whose
conversation
could
have
make
my
life
agreeable
.
    
<EOS>
I
often
expostulate
with
him
upon
this
malignant
behaviour
,
protest
my
desire
of
live
peaceably
with
him
;
and
beg
he
would
not
lay
me
under
the
necessity
of
change
my
measure
.
<EOS>
He
be
deaf
to
all
my
remonstrance
,
(
tho
'
I
warn
him
more
than
once
of
the
event
)
persist
in
his
maxim
of
persecution
;
and
,
after
repeat
quarrel
,
I
again
leave
his
house
,
fully
determine
to
suffer
all
sort
of
extremity
,
rather
than
subject
myself
to
the
tyranny
of
his
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
this
year
be
productive
of
one
fatal
event
,
which
I
feel
with
the
utmost
sensibility
of
sorrow
,
and
shall
always
remember
with
regret
:
<EOS>
I
mean
the
death
of
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
with
whom
I
have
constantly
maintain
an
intimate
correspondence
since
the
first
commencement
of
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
man
,
and
promise
to
be
one
of
the
bright
ornament
that
this
or
any
other
age
have
produce
.
<EOS>
I
enjoy
his
friendship
,
without
reserve
;
and
such
be
the
confidence
he
repose
in
my
integrity
,
from
long
experience
of
my
truth
,
that
he
often
say
he
would
believe
my
bare
assertion
,
even
tho
<EOS>
'
it
should
contradict
the
evidence
of
his
own
sense
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
term
upon
which
we
live
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
I
bear
the
loss
of
him
without
repine
:
indeed
my
grief
be
unspeakable
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
the
edge
of
it
be
now
smooth
by
the
lenient
hand
of
time
,
I
shall
never
cease
to
cherish
his
memory
with
the
most
tender
remembrance
.
    
<EOS>
during
the
last
period
of
my
living
with
my
lord
,
I
have
agree
to
the
expediency
of
obtain
an
act
of
parliament
,
which
would
enable
him
to
pay
his
debt
;
on
which
occasion
there
be
a
necessity
for
cancel
a
deed
that
subsist
between
us
,
relate
to
a
separate
maintenance
;
to
which
,
on
certain
provisos
,
I
be
intitle
:
and
this
be
to
be
set
aside
,
so
far
as
it
interfere
with
the
above
mention
scheme
,
while
the
rest
of
it
should
remain
in
force
.
    
<EOS>
when
this
affair
be
about
to
be
transact
,
my
lord
very
generously
insist
upon
my
concurrence
,
in
annul
the
whole
settlement
;
and
when
I
refuse
to
comply
with
this
demand
,
because
this
be
the
sole
resource
I
have
against
his
ill
usage
,
he
would
not
proceed
in
the
execution
of
his
plan
,
tho
'
by
drop
it
<EOS>
he
hurt
no
-
body
but
himself
;
and
accuse
me
of
have
recede
from
my
word
,
after
I
have
draw
him
into
a
considerable
expence
.
    
<EOS>
this
imputation
of
break
my
word
,
which
I
defy
the
whole
world
to
prove
I
ever
do
,
incense
me
the
more
,
as
I
myself
have
propose
the
scheme
for
his
service
,
altho
'
<EOS>
I
know
the
accomplishment
of
it
would
endanger
the
validity
of
my
own
settlement
;
and
my
indignation
be
still
more
augment
by
the
behaviour
of
Mr
G
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
always
profess
a
regard
for
my
interest
,
and
upon
my
last
accommodation
with
my
lord
,
undertake
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
my
father
and
me
:
but
when
he
be
question
about
the
particular
of
this
difference
,
and
desire
to
declare
whether
his
lordship
or
I
be
to
blame
,
he
decline
the
office
of
arbitrator
,
refuse
to
be
explicit
on
the
subject
,
and
by
certain
shrewd
hum
and
ha
be
signify
his
disapprobation
of
my
conduct
;
and
yet
this
very
man
,
when
I
impart
to
him
,
in
confidence
,
my
intention
of
make
another
retreat
,
and
frankly
ask
his
opinion
of
my
design
,
seem
to
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of
it
,
in
these
remarkable
word
:
"
Madam
,
if
I
think
,
or
have
hope
of
my
lord
's
grow
better
,
I
would
down
on
my
knee
,
to
desire
you
to
stay
;
but
as
I
have
not
,
I
say
nothing
.
"
    
<EOS>
if
he
connive
at
my
conduct
in
this
particular
,
why
should
he
disapprove
of
it
,
when
all
I
ask
be
but
common
justice
?
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
dependent
;
and
therefore
I
excuse
his
phlegmatic
(
not
to
call
it
unfriendly
)
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
he
could
not
be
too
cautious
of
give
offence
to
his
lordship
,
who
sometimes
make
him
feel
the
effect
of
that
wrath
which
other
people
have
kindle
;
particularly
,
in
consequence
of
a
small
adventure
which
happen
about
this
very
period
of
time
.
    
<EOS>
a
very
agreeable
,
sprightly
,
good
-
natured
young
man
,
a
near
relation
of
my
lord
,
happen
to
be
at
our
house
one
evening
,
when
there
be
a
fire
in
the
neighbourhood
,
we
agree
to
go
and
sup
at
a
tavern
,
en
famille
;
and
have
spend
the
evening
with
great
mirth
and
good
humour
,
this
young
gentleman
,
who
be
naturally
facetious
,
in
take
his
leave
,
salute
us
all
round
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
who
have
before
entertain
some
jealousy
of
his
kinsman
,
be
very
much
provoke
by
this
trifling
incident
,
but
very
prudently
suppress
his
displeasure
till
he
return
to
his
own
house
,
where
his
rage
co
-
operating
with
the
Champagne
he
have
drink
,
inflame
him
to
such
a
degree
of
resolution
,
that
he
spring
upon
the
innocent
G####n
,
and
collar
him
with
great
fury
,
though
he
be
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
cause
of
his
indignation
.
    
<EOS>
this
extravagant
and
frantic
behaviour
,
add
to
the
other
grievance
under
which
I
labour
,
hasten
my
resolution
of
leave
him
;
and
he
to
this
day
blame
his
relation
,
as
the
immediate
cause
of
my
escape
,
whereas
he
ought
to
place
it
to
the
account
of
his
own
madness
and
indiscretion
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
retire
to
Park
-
street
,
he
caution
all
my
tradesman
(
not
even
except
my
baker
)
against
give
me
credit
,
assure
them
that
he
would
not
pay
any
debt
I
should
contract
;
and
the
difficulty
to
which
I
be
reduce
,
in
consequence
of
this
charitable
declaration
,
together
with
the
reflection
of
what
I
have
suffer
,
and
may
undergo
,
from
the
caprice
and
barbarity
of
his
disposition
,
affect
my
health
so
much
,
that
I
be
take
again
ill
,
and
my
life
think
in
danger
.
    
<EOS>
My
constitution
,
however
,
get
the
well
of
my
distemper
,
and
I
be
order
into
the
country
by
my
physician
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
;
<EOS>
so
that
I
find
myself
under
the
necessity
of
keep
two
house
,
when
I
be
little
able
to
support
one
,
and
set
up
my
chariot
,
because
I
could
not
defray
the
expence
of
an
hackney
coach
;
for
I
have
as
much
credit
give
me
as
I
ask'd
for
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
lord
's
order
to
the
contrary
.
    
<EOS>
have
recruit
my
spirit
in
the
country
,
I
return
to
town
,
and
be
visit
by
my
friend
,
who
never
forsook
me
in
adversity
,
and
in
the
summer
remove
to
an
house
in
Essex
,
where
I
live
a
few
month
in
great
tranquillity
,
unmoleste
by
my
tyrant
,
who
sometimes
give
me
a
whole
year
's
respite
.
<EOS>
here
I
use
to
ride
and
drive
by
turn
(
as
my
humour
dictate
)
with
horse
which
be
lend
me
;
and
I
have
the
company
of
my
lover
,
and
another
gentleman
,
who
be
a
very
agreeable
companion
,
and
of
singular
service
to
me
in
the
sequel
.
    
<EOS>
at
last
,
my
lord
have
receive
intelligence
of
the
place
of
my
abode
,
and
<EOS>
his
torment
humour
recurring
<EOS>
,
he
set
out
for
my
habitation
,
and
in
the
morning
appear
in
his
coach
and
fix
,
attend
by
Mr
G####n
,
and
another
person
,
whom
he
have
engage
for
the
purpose
,
with
several
domestick
armed
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
shut
up
my
door
at
his
approach
,
and
refuse
him
admittance
,
which
he
endeavour
to
obtain
by
a
succession
of
prayer
and
threat
;
but
I
be
deaf
to
both
,
and
resolve
to
hold
out
to
the
last
.
    
<EOS>
see
me
determine
,
he
begin
his
attack
,
and
his
servant
actually
force
their
way
into
the
house
;
upon
which
I
retreat
up
stair
,
and
fortify
myself
in
an
apartment
,
which
the
assailant
storm
with
such
fury
,
that
the
door
begin
to
give
way
,
and
I
retire
into
another
room
.
    
<EOS>
Whilst
<EOS>
I
remain
in
this
post
,
Mr
g####n
demand
a
parley
,
in
which
he
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
favour
my
lord
with
an
interview
,
otherwise
he
know
not
what
would
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
to
this
remonstrance
I
reply
,
that
I
be
not
dispose
to
comply
with
his
request
;
and
that
though
their
design
should
be
murder
,
I
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
death
.
<EOS>
upon
this
declaration
they
renew
their
attack
,
which
they
carry
on
with
indifferent
success
till
the
afternoon
,
when
my
lord
(
as
if
he
have
be
at
play
)
send
a
formal
message
to
me
,
desire
that
all
hostility
should
cease
,
till
after
both
party
should
have
dine
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
my
own
servant
come
for
instruction
;
and
I
order
them
to
let
him
have
every
thing
which
he
should
call
for
,
as
far
as
the
house
would
afford
.
    
<EOS>
He
do
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
;
but
,
sit
down
with
his
companion
,
eat
up
my
dinner
without
hesitation
,
after
he
have
pay
me
the
compliment
,
of
desire
to
know
what
he
should
send
up
to
my
apartment
.
<EOS>
far
from
have
any
stomach
to
partake
of
his
meal
,
I
sit
solitary
upon
my
bed
,
in
a
state
of
melancholy
expectation
,
have
fasten
the
door
of
the
outward
room
for
my
security
,
while
I
keep
my
chamber
open
for
the
convenience
of
air
,
the
weather
be
excessively
hot
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
indulge
his
appetite
,
resume
his
attempt
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
hear
a
noise
in
the
next
room
;
upon
which
I
start
up
,
and
perceive
that
he
have
get
into
my
anti
-
chamber
,
by
the
help
of
a
bench
that
stand
under
the
window
<EOS>
,
I
fling
to
the
door
of
my
room
,
which
I
lock
with
great
expedition
,
and
open
another
that
communicate
with
the
staircase
,
run
out
of
the
house
,
through
a
croud
of
more
than
an
hundred
people
,
whom
this
fray
have
gather
together
.
    
<EOS>
be
universally
beloved
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
respect
by
my
lord
's
servant
,
I
pass
among
them
untouched
,
and
take
refuge
in
a
neighbouring
cottage
;
while
his
lordship
bawl
and
roar
for
assistance
,
be
afraid
to
come
out
as
he
have
get
in
.
<EOS>
without
wait
for
his
deliberation
,
I
change
cloath
with
the
poor
woman
who
have
give
me
shelter
,
and
in
her
blue
apron
and
straw
-
hat
sally
out
into
the
field
,
intend
to
seek
protection
at
the
house
of
a
gentleman
not
far
off
,
though
I
be
utterly
ignorant
of
the
road
that
lead
to
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
my
good
fortune
to
meet
with
a
farmer
,
who
undertake
to
conduct
me
to
the
place
;
otherwise
I
should
have
miss
my
way
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
lain
in
the
field
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
it
be
eight
o'clock
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
under
the
direction
of
this
guide
,
I
traverse
hedge
and
ditch
,
(
for
I
would
not
venture
to
travel
in
the
highway
,
lest
I
should
fall
into
the
hand
of
my
pursuer
)
and
after
I
have
actually
tumble
in
the
mire
,
and
walk
six
or
seven
long
mile
,
by
the
help
of
a
good
spirit
,
which
never
fail
me
on
such
occasion
<EOS>
,
I
arrive
at
the
place
,
and
ring
the
bell
at
the
garden
-
gate
for
admittance
.
    
<EOS>
see
my
figure
,
which
be
very
uncouth
,
together
with
my
draggle
condition
,
they
deny
me
entrance
;
but
when
they
understand
who
I
be
,
immediately
open
the
door
,
and
I
be
hospitably
entertain
,
after
have
be
the
subject
of
mirth
,
on
account
of
my
dress
and
adventure
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
I
return
,
and
take
possession
of
my
house
again
,
where
I
resume
my
former
amusement
,
which
I
enjoy
in
quiet
,
for
the
space
of
a
whole
month
,
wait
with
resignation
for
the
issue
of
my
law
-
suit
;
when
one
afternoon
,
I
be
apprize
of
his
lordship
's
approach
,
by
one
of
my
spy
,
whom
I
always
employ
to
reconnoitre
the
road
;
and
so
fortunate
be
I
in
the
choice
of
these
scout
,
that
I
never
be
betray
by
one
of
them
,
though
they
be
often
bribe
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
receive
this
intelligence
,
than
I
order
my
horse
to
be
saddle
,
and
mount
,
ride
out
of
sight
immediately
,
direct
my
course
a
different
way
from
the
London
road
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
long
proceed
in
this
tract
,
when
my
career
be
all
of
a
sudden
stopp'd
<EOS>
by
a
five
-
bar
gate
,
which
,
after
some
hesitation
,
I
resolve
to
leap
(
my
horse
be
an
old
hunter
)
if
I
should
find
myself
pursued
.
<EOS>
however
,
with
much
difficulty
I
make
shift
to
open
it
,
and
arrive
in
safety
at
the
house
of
my
very
good
friend
Mr
G
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
have
promise
me
his
protection
,
if
it
should
be
want
.
    
<EOS>
thus
secure
for
the
present
,
I
send
out
spy
to
bring
information
of
his
lordship
's
proceeding
,
and
understand
that
he
have
take
possession
of
my
house
,
turn
my
servant
adrift
,
and
make
himself
master
of
all
my
moveable
,
cloath
and
paper
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
paper
,
they
be
of
no
consequence
,
but
of
cloath
I
have
a
good
stock
;
and
when
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
do
not
intend
to
relinquish
his
conquest
,
I
think
it
be
high
time
for
me
to
remove
to
a
great
distance
from
his
quarter
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
two
day
after
my
escape
,
I
set
out
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
in
a
chariot
and
four
,
which
I
borrow
of
my
friend
,
attend
by
a
footman
,
who
be
a
stout
fellow
and
well
armed
,
I
myself
be
provide
with
a
brace
of
good
pistol
,
which
I
be
fully
determine
to
use
,
against
any
person
who
should
presume
to
lay
violent
hand
upon
me
,
except
my
lord
,
for
whom
a
less
mortal
weapon
would
have
suffice
,
such
as
a
bodkin
or
a
tinder
-
box
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
farth
from
my
intention
,
than
the
desire
of
hurt
any
live
creature
,
much
less
<EOS>
my
husband
<EOS>
;
my
design
be
only
to
defend
myself
from
cruelty
and
oppression
,
which
I
know
,
by
fatal
experience
,
would
infallibly
be
my
lot
,
should
he
get
me
into
his
power
:
and
I
think
I
have
as
good
a
right
to
preserve
my
happiness
,
as
that
which
every
individual
have
to
preserve
his
life
,
especially
against
a
set
of
ruffian
,
who
be
engage
to
rob
me
of
it
,
for
a
little
dirty
lucre
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
our
journey
,
the
footman
come
up
,
and
tell
me
I
be
dogg'd
;
upon
which
I
look
out
,
and
see
a
man
ride
by
the
chariot
-
side
,
present
one
of
my
pistol
out
at
the
window
,
and
preserve
that
posture
of
defence
,
until
he
think
proper
to
retreat
,
and
rid
me
of
the
fear
that
attend
his
company
.
<EOS>
I
arrive
in
town
,
and
change
my
equipage
,
hire
an
open
chaise
,
in
which
(
though
I
be
almost
starve
with
cold
)
<EOS>
I
travel
to
Reading
,
which
I
reach
by
ten
next
morning
;
and
from
thence
proceed
farther
in
the
country
,
with
a
view
of
take
refuge
with
Mrs
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
be
my
particular
friend
.
    
<EOS>
here
I
should
have
find
shelter
,
though
my
lord
have
be
beforehand
with
me
,
and
endeavour
to
prepossess
her
against
my
conduct
,
have
not
the
house
be
croude
with
company
,
among
whom
I
could
not
possibly
have
be
conceal
,
especially
from
her
brother
,
who
be
an
intimate
friend
of
my
persecutor
.
    
<EOS>
thing
be
thus
situate
,
I
enjoy
but
a
very
short
interview
with
her
,
in
which
her
sorrow
and
perplexity
on
my
account
appear
with
great
expression
in
her
countenance
;
and
though
it
be
not
in
her
power
to
afford
me
the
relief
I
expect
,
she
,
in
the
most
genteel
manner
,
send
after
me
a
small
sum
of
money
,
think
that
,
consider
the
hurry
in
which
I
leave
my
house
,
I
may
have
occasion
for
it
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
be
by
this
time
benumb
with
cold
,
fatigue
with
travel
,
and
almost
fret
to
death
by
my
disappointment
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
no
time
to
indulge
despondence
;
since
no
body
could
,
or
would
,
assist
me
,
I
stand
the
more
in
need
of
my
own
resolution
and
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
after
some
deliberation
,
I
steer
my
course
back
to
London
;
and
be
unwilling
to
return
by
the
same
road
in
which
I
come
,
as
well
as
impatient
to
be
at
the
end
of
my
journey
,
I
choose
the
Bagshot
way
,
and
venture
to
cross
the
heath
by
moon
-
light
.
    
<EOS>
here
I
be
attack
by
a
foot
-
pad
arm
with
a
broad
-
sword
,
who
come
up
,
and
demand
my
money
.
<EOS>
My
stock
amount
to
twelve
guinea
;
and
I
foresaw
,
that
should
I
be
stripp'd
of
the
whole
sum
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
travel
without
discover
who
I
be
,
and
,
consequently
,
run
the
risk
of
be
detect
by
my
pursuer
.
    
<EOS>
on
these
consideration
,
I
give
the
fellow
three
guinea
and
some
silver
;
with
which
he
be
so
far
from
be
satisfy
,
that
he
threaten
to
search
me
for
more
:
<EOS>
but
I
order
the
coachman
to
proceed
,
and
by
good
fortune
escape
that
ceremony
;
though
I
be
under
some
apprehension
of
be
overtake
with
a
pistol
-
bullet
in
my
flight
,
and
therefore
hold
down
my
head
in
the
chaise
,
in
imitation
of
some
great
man
,
who
be
say
to
have
duck
in
the
same
manner
,
in
the
day
of
battle
.
    
<EOS>
My
fear
happen
to
be
disappoint
:
I
lie
at
an
inn
upon
the
road
,
and
next
day
arrive
in
town
,
in
the
utmost
difficulty
and
distress
;
for
I
know
not
where
to
fix
my
habitation
,
and
be
destitute
of
all
mean
of
support
.
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
I
apply
to
my
lawyer
,
who
recommend
me
to
the
house
of
a
tradesman
in
Westminster
,
where
I
lodge
and
board
,
upon
credit
,
with
my
faithful
Abigail
,
(
whom
I
shall
distinguish
by
the
name
of
Mrs
s####r
)
for
the
space
of
ten
week
,
during
which
I
see
nobody
,
and
never
once
stir
abroad
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
be
thus
harrasse
out
of
all
enjoyment
of
life
,
and
reduce
to
the
utmost
indigence
,
by
the
cruelty
of
my
persecutor
,
who
have
even
stripp'd
<EOS>
me
of
my
wear
apparel
<EOS>
,
I
make
a
conquest
of
lord
D
#
#
#
#
,
a
nobleman
who
be
now
dead
,
and
therefore
I
shall
say
little
of
his
character
,
which
be
perfectly
well
know
:
<EOS>
this
only
will
I
observe
,
that
,
next
to
my
own
tyrant
,
he
be
the
only
person
of
whom
I
have
the
great
abhorrence
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
these
two
come
in
competition
,
I
prefer
the
offer
of
this
new
lover
,
which
be
very
considerable
;
and
as
an
asylum
be
the
chief
thing
I
want
,
agree
to
follow
him
to
his
country
-
seat
,
whither
<EOS>
I
actually
send
my
cloath
,
which
I
have
purchase
upon
credit
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
upon
mature
deliberation
,
I
change
my
mind
,
and
signify
my
resolution
in
a
letter
,
desire
at
the
same
time
,
that
my
baggage
may
be
send
back
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
message
,
I
expect
a
visit
from
him
,
in
all
the
rage
of
indignation
and
disappointment
,
and
give
order
,
that
he
should
not
be
admit
into
my
house
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
this
precaution
,
he
find
mean
to
procure
entrance
;
and
one
of
the
first
object
that
I
see
,
next
morning
,
in
my
bed
-
chamber
,
be
my
lover
,
arm
with
his
horse
-
whip
,
against
which
(
from
the
knowledge
of
the
man
)
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
myself
altogether
secure
;
though
I
be
not
much
alarm
,
because
I
believe
myself
superior
to
him
in
point
of
bravery
,
should
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
:
<EOS>
but
,
contrary
to
my
expectation
,
and
his
usual
behaviour
to
our
sex
,
he
accost
me
very
politely
,
and
begin
to
expostulate
upon
the
content
of
my
letter
.
<EOS>
I
freely
tell
him
,
that
I
have
rashly
assent
to
his
proposal
,
for
my
own
convenience
only
;
that
when
I
reflect
on
what
I
have
do
,
I
think
it
ungenerous
in
me
to
live
with
him
upon
these
term
;
and
that
,
as
I
do
not
like
him
,
and
could
not
dissemble
,
such
a
correspondence
could
never
tend
to
the
satisfaction
of
either
.
<EOS>
He
allow
the
inference
be
just
,
though
he
be
very
much
chagrin
at
my
previous
proceeding
:
he
relinquish
his
claim
,
restore
my
cloath
,
and
never
afterwards
upbraid
me
with
my
conduct
in
this
affair
;
though
he
at
one
time
own
,
that
he
still
love
me
,
and
ever
should
,
because
I
have
use
him
ill
;
a
declaration
that
strongly
mark
the
peculiarity
of
his
character
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
I
own
that
my
behaviour
on
this
occasion
,
be
no
other
way
excusable
,
than
on
account
of
the
miserable
perplexity
of
my
circumstance
,
which
be
often
so
calamitous
,
that
I
wonder
I
have
not
be
compel
to
take
such
step
,
as
would
have
render
my
conduct
much
more
exceptionable
than
it
really
be
.
    
<EOS>
at
last
,
all
my
hope
be
blast
by
the
issue
of
my
suit
,
which
be
determine
in
favour
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
even
then
I
refuse
to
yield
;
on
the
contrary
,
come
out
of
retirement
,
I
take
lodging
in
Suffolk
-
street
,
and
set
my
tyrant
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
but
,
be
unwilling
to
trust
my
door
to
the
care
of
other
people
,
I
take
an
house
in
Conduit
-
street
;
and
no
sooner
appear
in
the
world
again
,
than
I
be
surround
by
diver
and
sundry
sort
of
admirer
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
receive
the
incense
and
address
of
all
kind
under
the
sun
,
except
that
sort
which
be
most
to
my
liking
,
a
man
capable
of
contract
and
inspire
a
mutual
attachment
;
but
such
a
one
be
equally
rare
and
inestimable
:
not
but
that
I
own
myself
greatly
oblige
to
all
those
who
cultivate
my
good
grace
,
though
they
be
very
little
beholden
to
me
;
for
,
where
I
do
not
really
love
,
I
could
never
profess
that
passion
:
that
sort
of
dissimulation
be
a
slavery
that
no
honest
nature
will
undergo
.
<EOS>
except
one
worthy
young
man
whom
I
sometimes
see
,
they
be
a
strange
medley
of
insignificant
being
;
one
be
insipid
,
another
ridiculously
affect
,
a
third
void
of
all
education
,
a
fourth
altogether
inconsistent
;
and
in
short
,
I
find
as
many
trifling
character
among
the
man
,
as
ever
I
observe
in
my
own
sex
.
    
<EOS>
some
of
them
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
bring
over
to
my
maxim
,
while
they
attempt
to
make
a
proselyte
of
me
;
but
find
the
task
impracticable
on
both
side
,
we
very
wisely
dropt
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
I
be
bless
with
the
acquaintance
of
one
nobleman
,
who
be
,
perhaps
,
the
first
character
in
England
,
in
point
of
honour
,
integrity
,
with
,
sense
and
benevolence
:
when
I
have
thus
distinguish
him
,
I
need
scarce
mention
<EOS>
lord
  
.
<EOS>
this
great
,
this
good
man
,
possess
every
accomplishment
requisite
to
inspire
admiration
,
love
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
with
infinitely
more
merit
than
almost
ever
fall
to
one
man
's
share
,
he
manifest
such
diffidence
of
his
own
qualification
,
as
can
not
fail
to
prepossess
every
company
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
observe
nothing
,
yet
see
every
thing
;
his
manner
of
tell
a
story
,
and
make
trifle
elegant
,
be
peculiar
to
himself
;
and
though
he
have
a
thousand
oddity
,
they
serve
only
to
make
him
more
agreeable
.
<EOS>
after
what
I
have
say
,
it
may
be
suppose
that
I
be
enamour
of
his
person
:
but
this
be
not
the
case
;
love
be
altogether
capricious
and
fanciful
;
yet
I
admire
,
honour
,
and
esteem
him
to
the
high
degree
;
and
when
I
observe
,
that
his
character
resemble
that
of
my
dear
depart
friend
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
;
or
rather
,
that
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
have
he
live
,
would
have
resemble
lord
  
,
I
pay
the
high
compliment
I
can
conceive
both
to
the
living
and
the
dead
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
nobleman
's
friendship
and
conversation
I
think
myself
happy
;
though
I
be
,
as
usual
,
expose
to
the
indefatigable
effort
of
my
lord
,
who
,
one
day
,
while
I
be
favour
with
the
company
of
this
generous
friend
,
appear
at
my
door
in
his
coach
,
attend
by
another
gentleman
,
who
demand
entrance
,
with
an
air
of
authority
.
    
<EOS>
a
very
honest
footman
,
who
have
be
long
in
my
service
,
run
up
stair
in
the
utmost
consternation
,
and
give
me
an
account
of
what
have
happen
below
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
I
tell
him
he
have
nothing
to
answer
for
,
and
order
him
to
keep
the
door
fast
shut
against
all
opposition
:
though
I
be
so
much
affected
with
this
unexpected
assault
,
that
lord
   
say
,
he
be
never
more
surprized
and
shock
in
his
life
,
than
at
the
horror
which
appear
in
my
countenance
,
when
I
see
the
coach
stop
at
my
door
.
    
<EOS>
My
little
hero
be
refuse
admittance
,
go
away
,
threaten
to
return
speedily
with
a
reinforcement
;
and
during
this
interval
,
I
provide
myself
with
a
soldier
,
whom
I
place
centinel
at
the
door
withinside
,
to
guard
me
from
the
danger
of
such
assault
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
true
to
his
promise
,
march
back
with
his
auxiliary
,
reinforce
with
a
constable
,
and
repeat
his
demand
of
be
admit
;
and
my
soldier
open
the
sash
,
in
order
to
answer
him
accord
to
my
direction
,
he
no
sooner
perceive
the
red
coat
,
than
he
be
seize
with
such
a
pannic
,
that
he
instantly
flee
with
great
precipitation
;
and
when
he
recount
the
adventure
,
like
Falstaff
in
the
play
,
multiply
my
guard
into
a
whole
file
of
musqueteer
.
<EOS>
He
also
make
shift
to
discover
the
gentleman
,
who
have
be
so
kind
as
to
lend
me
one
of
his
company
,
and
complain
of
him
to
the
duke
of
N
#
#
#
#
,
in
hope
of
see
him
broke
for
this
misdemeanour
;
but
in
that
expectation
he
be
luckily
disappointed
.
    
<EOS>
perceive
that
in
England
I
should
never
enjoy
peace
,
but
be
continually
subject
to
those
alarm
and
disquiet
which
have
already
impair
my
health
and
spirit
,
I
resolve
to
repair
again
to
France
,
my
good
refuge
and
sure
retreat
from
the
persecution
of
my
tyrant
.
<EOS>
yet
,
before
I
take
this
step
,
I
endeavour
,
by
the
advice
of
my
friend
,
to
conceal
myself
near
Windsor
;
but
be
in
a
little
time
discover
by
my
lord
,
and
hunt
out
of
my
lurking
place
,
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
then
remove
to
Chelsea
,
where
I
suffer
inconceivable
uneasiness
and
agitation
of
mind
,
from
the
nature
of
my
situation
,
my
tranquillity
be
thus
incessantly
invade
by
a
man
who
could
not
be
satisfied
with
me
,
and
yet
could
not
live
without
me
:
so
that
,
though
I
be
very
much
indisposed
,
I
set
out
for
France
,
by
the
way
of
the
Hague
,
as
the
war
have
shut
up
all
other
communication
,
have
no
other
attendant
but
my
woman
S####r
,
who
,
though
she
dread
the
sea
,
and
be
upon
the
brink
of
matrimony
,
would
not
quit
me
in
such
a
calamitous
condition
,
until
I
be
join
by
my
footman
and
other
maid
,
whom
I
order
to
follow
me
with
the
baggage
.
<EOS>
but
,
before
my
departure
,
I
send
a
message
to
lord
  
,
demand
my
cloath
,
which
he
have
seize
in
Essex
;
and
he
refuse
to
deliver
them
,
I
be
oblige
to
equip
myself
anew
,
upon
credit
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
supply
with
money
for
my
journey
by
my
good
friend
L
#
#
#
#
;
and
after
a
short
and
pleasant
passage
,
arrive
at
the
Hague
,
where
I
stay
two
month
,
and
part
with
S####r
,
on
whom
I
settle
an
annuity
of
five
and
twenty
pound
,
payable
out
of
the
provision
which
I
have
or
may
obtain
from
my
husband
.
<EOS>
the
same
allowance
have
I
prevail
upon
lord
B
#
#
#
#
to
grant
to
another
maid
,
who
attend
me
while
I
live
in
his
house
.
    
<EOS>
I
do
not
much
relish
the
people
in
Holland
,
because
they
seem
entirely
devoted
to
self
-
interest
,
without
any
taste
for
pleasure
or
politeness
;
a
species
of
disposition
that
could
not
be
very
agreeable
to
me
,
who
always
despise
money
,
have
an
unbounded
benevolence
of
heart
,
and
love
pleasure
beyond
every
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
pleasure
,
I
would
not
be
understand
to
mean
sensuality
,
which
constitute
the
supreme
happiness
of
those
only
,
who
be
void
of
sentiment
and
imagination
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
receive
some
civility
in
this
place
;
and
among
the
rest
,
the
reputation
of
have
for
my
lover
the
king
of
p
#
#
#
#
's
minister
,
who
be
young
and
airy
,
and
visit
me
often
;
circumstance
that
be
sufficient
to
lay
me
under
the
imputation
of
an
amour
,
which
I
frequently
incur
,
without
have
give
the
least
cause
of
suspicion
.
    
<EOS>
have
take
leave
of
my
dutch
friend
,
I
depart
from
the
Hague
,
in
company
with
an
Englishwoman
,
whom
I
have
choose
for
that
purpose
,
and
arrive
at
Antwerp
,
with
much
difficulty
and
danger
,
the
highway
be
infest
with
robber
.
<EOS>
after
have
repose
myself
a
few
day
in
this
city
,
I
hire
a
coach
for
myself
,
and
set
out
,
with
my
companion
,
for
Brussels
;
but
,
before
we
reach
Mechlin
,
our
vehicle
be
attack
by
two
hussar
,
who
,
with
their
sabre
draw
,
oblige
the
coachman
to
drive
into
a
wood
near
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
at
first
imagine
they
want
to
examine
our
passport
,
but
be
soon
too
well
convinced
of
their
design
;
and
though
very
much
shock
at
the
discovery
,
find
resolution
enough
to
suppress
my
concern
,
so
that
it
should
not
aggravate
the
terror
of
the
young
woman
,
who
have
almost
die
with
apprehension
.
    
<EOS>
I
even
encourage
her
to
hope
for
the
good
;
and
address
myself
to
the
robber
in
French
,
begg'd
in
the
most
suppliant
manner
,
that
they
would
spare
our
life
;
upon
which
,
one
of
them
,
who
be
a
little
fellow
,
assure
me
in
the
same
language
,
that
we
have
nothing
to
fear
for
our
person
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
be
convey
in
a
state
of
dreadful
suspence
about
three
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
wood
,
the
ruffian
come
into
the
coach
,
and
take
my
key
,
which
I
keep
ready
in
my
hand
for
them
,
open
three
large
trunk
,
that
contain
my
baggage
,
and
empty
them
of
every
thing
but
my
hoop
and
a
few
book
,
pack
up
their
booty
in
a
cloth
;
then
rob
me
of
my
money
and
jewel
,
even
to
my
shoe
-
buckle
and
sleeve
-
button
,
take
my
footman
's
laced
hat
,
and
give
it
,
by
way
of
gratification
,
to
a
peasant
,
who
come
from
behind
the
bush
,
and
assist
them
in
packing
.
    
<EOS>
this
affair
be
dispatch
,
they
order
us
to
return
to
the
road
,
by
a
different
way
from
that
in
which
we
be
carry
into
the
wood
;
and
mount
their
horse
,
ride
off
with
the
plunder
,
though
not
before
the
little
fellow
,
who
be
the
least
ferocious
of
the
two
,
have
come
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
wish
us
a
good
journey
;
a
compliment
which
I
heartily
return
,
be
extremely
well
pleased
at
the
retreat
of
two
such
companion
,
who
have
detain
us
a
whole
half
hour
;
during
which
,
notwithstanding
the
assurance
I
have
receive
,
I
be
in
continual
apprehension
of
see
their
operation
conclude
with
the
murder
of
us
all
;
for
I
suppose
they
be
of
that
gang
,
who
have
some
time
before
murthere
a
french
officer
,
and
use
a
lady
extremely
ill
,
after
have
rifle
her
of
all
she
have
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
undergo
pillage
,
and
be
reduce
to
the
extremity
of
indigence
in
a
foreign
land
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
my
reflection
be
very
comfortable
;
and
yet
,
though
I
sustain
the
whole
damage
,
I
be
the
only
person
in
the
company
who
bear
the
accident
with
any
resolution
and
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
My
coachman
and
valet
seem
quite
petrified
with
fear
;
and
it
be
not
,
till
I
have
repeat
my
direction
,
that
the
former
drive
farther
into
the
wood
,
and
take
the
first
turning
to
the
right
,
in
order
to
regain
the
road
,
accord
to
the
command
of
the
robber
,
which
I
do
not
choose
to
disobey
.
    
<EOS>
this
misfortune
I
suffer
by
the
misinformation
I
receive
at
Antwerp
,
where
I
would
have
provide
myself
with
an
escort
,
have
I
not
be
assure
,
that
there
be
not
the
least
occasion
to
put
myself
to
such
extraordinary
expence
:
and
indeed
,
the
robber
take
the
only
half
hour
in
which
they
could
have
have
an
opportunity
of
plunder
us
;
for
we
no
sooner
return
into
the
highway
,
than
we
meet
with
the
french
artillery
come
from
Brussels
,
which
be
a
security
to
us
,
during
the
rest
of
our
journey
.
<EOS>
We
be
afterwards
inform
at
a
small
village
,
that
there
be
actually
a
large
gang
of
deserter
,
who
harbour
in
that
wood
,
from
which
they
make
excursion
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
keep
the
peasant
in
continual
alarm
.
    
<EOS>
have
proceed
a
little
way
,
we
be
stopp'd
by
the
artillery
cross
a
bridge
;
and
as
the
train
be
very
long
,
must
have
be
detain
till
night
,
have
not
a
soldier
inform
me
,
that
if
I
would
take
the
trouble
to
come
out
of
my
coach
,
and
apply
to
the
commandant
,
he
would
order
them
to
halt
,
and
allow
me
to
pass
.
    
<EOS>
I
take
the
man
's
advice
,
and
be
by
him
conduct
,
with
much
difficulty
,
through
the
croud
to
some
officer
,
who
seem
scarce
to
deserve
the
name
;
for
,
when
I
signify
my
request
,
they
neither
rise
up
,
nor
desire
me
to
sit
down
;
but
loll
in
their
chair
,
with
one
leg
stretch
out
,
ask
,
with
an
air
of
disrespectful
raillery
,
where
I
be
go
;
and
when
I
answer
,
"
to
Paris
;
"
desire
to
know
what
I
would
do
there
.
    
<EOS>
I
,
who
be
naturally
civil
where
I
be
civilly
use
,
and
saucy
enough
where
I
think
myself
treat
with
disregard
,
be
very
much
pique
at
their
insolent
and
unmannerly
behaviour
,
and
begin
to
reply
to
their
impertinent
question
,
very
abruptly
;
so
that
a
very
tart
dialogue
would
have
ensue
,
have
not
the
conversation
be
interrupt
by
a
tall
,
thin
,
genteel
young
french
nobleman
,
an
officer
in
the
army
,
who
chance
to
come
in
,
ask
with
great
politeness
,
what
I
would
please
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
then
repeat
my
desire
,
and
produce
my
passport
,
<EOS>
by
which
he
learn'd
who
I
be
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
give
order
,
that
my
coach
should
pass
;
and
afterwards
visit
me
at
Paris
,
have
obtain
my
permission
,
and
take
my
address
at
parting
;
while
the
other
,
understand
my
name
and
quality
,
ask
pardon
for
their
impolite
carriage
,
which
they
tell
me
be
owe
to
the
representation
of
the
soldier
,
who
give
them
to
understand
,
that
I
be
a
strolling
actress
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laugh
heartily
at
this
mistake
,
which
may
have
proceed
from
the
circumstance
of
my
appearance
,
my
footman
have
be
oblige
to
change
hat
with
the
peasant
,
and
myself
be
without
buckle
in
my
shoe
,
and
button
in
my
riding
-
shirt
,
while
my
countenance
still
retain
mark
of
the
fear
and
confusion
I
have
undergo
.
    
<EOS>
after
all
,
perhaps
the
fellow
be
a
droll
,
and
want
to
entertain
himself
at
my
expence
.
    
<EOS>
the
day
be
so
far
consume
in
these
adventure
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
take
up
my
lodging
at
Mechlin
,
where
I
address
myself
to
the
intendant
,
give
him
an
account
of
the
disaster
I
have
meet
with
,
and
desire
I
may
have
credit
at
the
inn
,
as
our
whole
company
could
not
raise
the
value
of
a
six
-
pence
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
tho
'
<EOS>
a
provincial
,
be
polite
in
his
way
,
and
not
only
grant
my
request
,
but
invite
me
to
lodge
at
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
give
him
my
company
at
supper
,
but
do
not
choose
to
sleep
in
his
quarter
,
because
he
appear
to
be
what
the
french
call
un
vieux
debauche
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
he
send
a
trumpet
to
the
general
,
with
a
detail
of
my
misfortune
,
in
hope
of
retrieve
what
I
have
lose
;
but
,
notwithstanding
all
possible
search
,
I
be
fain
to
put
up
with
my
damage
,
which
,
in
linen
,
lace
,
cloath
and
bauble
,
amount
to
upward
of
seven
hundred
pound
:
a
loss
which
never
deprive
me
of
one
moment
's
rest
;
for
though
I
lodge
at
a
miserable
inn
,
and
lie
in
a
paultry
bed
,
I
sleep
as
sound
as
if
nothing
extraordinary
have
happen
,
after
I
have
write
to
London
and
Paris
,
direct
that
the
payment
of
my
bill
of
credit
may
be
stopp'd
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
<EOS>
but
of
two
misfortune
in
life
,
capable
of
depress
my
spirit
,
namely
,
the
loss
of
health
and
friend
;
all
other
may
be
prevent
,
or
endure
.
<EOS>
the
article
of
that
calamity
,
which
I
chiefly
regret
,
be
a
picture
of
lord
W####m
,
and
some
inimitable
letter
from
Mr
B
#
#
#

.
    
<EOS>
from
Mechlin
I
proceed
to
Brussels
,
where
be
know
,
I
get
credit
for
some
necessary
,
and
borrow
twenty
guinea
,
to
defray
the
expence
of
my
journey
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
have
consult
with
my
friend
,
about
the
safe
method
of
travel
through
flander
,
I
be
persuade
to
take
place
in
the
public
voiture
;
and
accordingly
depart
,
not
without
fear
of
find
one
part
of
the
country
as
much
infest
with
robber
as
another
.
<EOS>
nor
be
these
apprehension
assuage
by
the
conversation
of
my
fellow
-
traveller
,
who
be
of
the
low
sort
of
people
,
that
delight
in
exaggerate
danger
,
entertain
me
all
the
way
,
with
an
account
of
all
the
robbery
and
murder
which
have
be
commit
on
that
road
,
with
many
additional
circumstance
of
their
own
invention
.
    
<EOS>
after
have

two
day
expose
to
this
comfortable
conversation
,
among
very
disagreeable
company
,
which
be
certainly
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
situation
in
life
,
I
arrive
at
Lisle
,
where
,
think
the
dangerous
part
of
the
journey
be
now
past
,
I
hire
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
in
two
day
more
reach
Paris
,
without
any
farth
molestation
.
    
<EOS>
upon
my
arrival
in
this
capital
,
I
be
immediately
visit
by
my
old
acquaintance
,
who
hear
my
disaster
,
offer
me
their
cloath
,
and
insist
upon
my
wear
them
,
until
I
could
be
otherwise
provide
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
engage
me
in
party
,
with
a
view
of
amuse
my
imagination
,
that
I
may
not
grow
melancholy
in
reflect
upon
my
loss
;
and
desire
me
to
repeat
the
particular
of
my
story
forty
time
over
,
express
great
surprize
at
our
not
be
murthere
,
or
ravish
at
least
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
this
last
specie
of
outrage
,
the
fear
of
it
never
once
enter
my
head
,
otherwise
I
should
have
be
more
shock
and
alarm
than
I
really
be
:
but
it
seem
this
be
the
chief
circumstance
of
my
companion
's
apprehension
;
and
I
can
not
help
observe
,
that
an
homely
woman
be
always
more
apt
to
entertain
those
fear
,
than
one
whose
person
expose
her
to
much
more
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
now
learn
,
that
the
risk
I
run
be
much
great
than
I
imagine
it
to
be
,
those
ruffian
be
familiarize
to
rape
as
well
as
murder
.
    
<EOS>
soon
after
my
appearance
in
Paris
,
I
be
favour
with
the
address
of
several
french
lover
;
but
I
never
have
any
taste
for
foreigner
,
or
indeed
for
any
amusement
of
that
kind
,
except
such
as
be
likely
to
be
last
,
and
settle
upon
a
more
agreeable
footing
than
that
of
common
gallantry
.
<EOS>
when
I
deviate
from
this
principle
,
my
conduct
be
the
effect
of
compulsion
,
and
therefore
I
be
never
easy
under
it
,
have
be
reduce
to
the
alternative
of
two
evil
,
the
least
of
which
I
be
oblige
to
choose
,
as
a
man
leap
into
the
sea
,
in
order
to
escape
from
a
ship
that
be
on
fire
.
    
<EOS>
though
I
reject
their
love
,
I
do
not
refuse
their
company
and
conversation
;
and
though
my
health
be
considerably
impair
by
the
shock
I
receive
in
my
last
adventure
,
which
be
considerably
great
than
I
at
first
imagine
,
and
affect
my
companion
so
much
,
that
she
do
not
recover
her
spirit
,
till
she
return
to
England
:
    
I
say
,
though
I
be
for
some
time
a
valetudinarian
,
I
enjoy
myself
in
great
tranquillity
for
the
space
of
ten
month
,
during
which
I
be
visit
by
English
,
Scotch
,
and
French
,
of
all
party
and
persuasion
;
for
pleasure
be
of
no
faction
,
and
that
be
the
chief
object
of
my
pursuit
;
neither
be
I
so
ambitious
of
be
a
politician
,
as
to
employ
my
time
and
thought
upon
subject
which
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
I
have
admirer
of
all
side
,
and
should
have
spend
my
time
very
much
to
my
liking
,
<EOS>
have
not
I
feel
my
fund
sensibly
diminish
,
without
any
prospect
of
their
be
repair
;
for
I
have
be
oblige
to
lay
out
a
great
part
of
the
sum
allot
for
my
subsistence
,
in
supply
my
companion
,
my
servant
and
myself
with
necessary
,
in
lieu
of
those
which
we
have
lose
.
    
<EOS>
have
before
mine
eye
the
uncomfortable
prospect
of
want
money
in
a
strange
place
,
I
find
myself
under
the
necessity
of
return
to
England
,
where
I
have
more
resource
than
I
could
possibly
have
among
foreigner
;
and
with
that
view
write
to
lord
  
's
agent
,
desire
that
I
may
be
enable
to
discharge
my
obligation
at
Paris
,
by
the
payment
of
my
pin
-
money
.
<EOS>
thus
a
negotiation
commence
,
and
his
lordship
promise
to
remit
money
for
the
clearance
of
my
Paris
debt
,
which
amount
to
four
hundred
pound
:
but
he
would
not
advance
one
farthe
more
,
though
I
give
him
to
understand
,
that
while
he
protract
the
agreement
,
I
must
inevitably
be
add
to
my
incumbrance
,
and
that
I
should
be
as
effectually
detain
by
a
debt
of
twenty
pound
,
as
if
I
owe
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
my
representation
,
he
would
not
part
with
one
shill
over
the
neat
sum
which
I
have
at
first
stipulate
;
so
that
all
my
measure
be
render
abortive
,
and
I
find
it
altogether
impracticable
to
execute
those
resolution
I
have
form
in
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
thus
do
he
,
for
a
meer
trifle
,
embarrass
the
woman
for
<EOS>
he
profess
the
most
unlimited
love
,
and
whose
principle
he
pretend
to
hold
in
the
utmost
veneration
.
<EOS>
indeed
his
confidence
in
my
integrity
be
not
without
foundation
;
for
many
wife
,
with
one
half
of
my
provocation
,
would
have
ruin
him
to
all
intent
and
purpose
;
whereas
,
notwithstanding
all
the
extraordinary
expence
,
to
which
I
have
be
expose
by
his
continual
persecution
,
he
never
pay
a
shilling
on
my
account
,
except
one
thousand
pound
,
exclusive
of
the
small
allowance
which
be
my
due
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
so
much
time
elapse
before
my
lord
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
advance
the
bare
four
hundred
,
that
I
be
involve
in
fresh
difficulty
,
from
which
I
find
it
impossible
to
extricate
myself
:
and
though
I
have
occasion
to
write
a
letter
to
my
benefactor
<EOS>
lord
  
,
in
which
I
express
my
acknowledgment
for
past
favour
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
venture
to
sollicit
more
;
even
when
I
be
encourage
by
a
very
obliging
answer
,
wherein
he
declare
,
that
the
good
quality
of
my
mind
and
heart
,
would
bind
him
to
me
in
friendship
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
ruminate
on
my
uncomfortable
situation
,
which
would
neither
permit
me
to
return
to
England
,
nor
to
stay
much
longer
where
I
be
,
a
young
Englishman
of
immense
fortune
take
Paris
in
his
way
from
Italy
,
accompany
by
a
most
agreeable
Scotchman
of
very
good
sense
and
great
vivacity
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
my
good
or
ill
fortune
to
become
acquainted
with
these
gentleman
,
who
have
see
me
at
the
opera
,
express
a
desire
of
be
know
to
me
,
and
accordingly
favour
me
with
a
visit
one
afternoon
,
when
the
brisk
North
Briton
ingrosse
the
whole
conversation
;
while
the
other
seem
fearful
and
diffident
even
to
a
degree
of
bashfulness
,
through
which
,
however
,
I
could
discern
a
delicate
sensibility
and
uncommon
understanding
:
there
be
in
his
person
(
which
be
very
agreeable
)
as
well
as
in
his
behaviour
,
a
certain
naivet
that
be
very
pleasing
;
and
at
this
first
interview
,
we
relish
each
other
's
company
so
well
,
that
a
sort
of
intimacy
immediately
commence
,
and
be
carry
on
in
a
succession
of
party
of
pleasure
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
find
him
fraught
with
all
the
tenderness
and
sentiment
that
render
the
heart
susceptible
of
the
most
refined
love
;
a
disposition
that
immediately
make
me
partial
to
him
,
while
it
subject
his
own
heart
to
all
the
violent
impression
of
a
passion
,
which
I
little
imagine
our
correspondence
would
have
produce
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
be
far
from
be
displeased
with
my
conquest
,
because
his
person
and
qualification
,
as
well
as
his
manner
of
address
,
be
very
much
to
my
liking
,
and
recommend
him
in
a
particular
manner
to
my
affection
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
make
a
great
progress
in
my
heart
than
I
myself
suspect
;
for
there
be
something
congenial
in
our
soul
,
which
from
our
first
meeting
I
believe
have
attract
us
(
unknown
to
ourselves
)
under
the
notion
of
friendship
and
regard
,
and
now
disclose
itself
in
the
most
passionate
love
.
    
<EOS>
I
listen
to
his
address
,
and
we
be
truly
happy
.
<EOS>
His
attachment
be
the
quintessence
of
tenderness
and
sincerity
,
while
his
generosity
know
no
bound
.
<EOS>
not
contented
with
have
pay
twelve
hundred
pound
on
my
account
,
in
the
space
of
one
fortnight
,
he
would
have
load
me
with
present
after
present
,
have
not
I
absolutely
refuse
to
accept
such
expensive
mark
of
his
munificence
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
even
mortify
at
those
instance
of
his
liberality
,
which
my
situation
compel
me
to
receive
,
l
,
being
but
little
acquainted
with
my
disposition
,
he
should
suspect
me
of
be
interested
in
my
love
,
and
judge
my
conduct
by
the
malicious
report
of
common
fame
,
which
(
he
afterwards
own
)
have
at
first
obtain
such
credit
with
him
,
that
he
believe
our
mutual
attachment
would
not
be
of
long
duration
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
this
particular
,
he
be
soon
undeceived
:
his
heart
,
though
naturally
adapt
for
the
melt
passion
,
have
hitherto
escape
untouched
by
all
the
lady
of
Italy
and
France
;
and
therefore
the
first
impression
be
the
more
deeply
fix
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
unpractised
in
the
way
of
common
gallantry
and
deceit
,
the
striking
simplicity
in
his
character
be
the
more
likely
to
engage
the
heart
of
one
who
know
the
perfidy
of
the
world
,
and
despise
all
the
farce
and
bombast
of
fashionable
profession
,
which
I
have
always
consider
as
the
phrase
of
vanity
and
ostentation
,
rather
than
the
genuine
language
of
love
.
<EOS>
besides
,
gratitude
have
a
considerable
share
in
augment
my
affection
,
which
manifest
itself
in
such
a
warm
,
cordial
,
artless
manner
,
as
increase
his
esteem
,
and
rivette
his
attachment
;
for
he
could
easily
perceive
,
from
the
whole
tenour
of
my
conduct
,
that
my
breast
be
an
utter
stranger
to
craft
and
dissimulation
:
yet
I
be
at
first
fearful
of
contract
any
engagement
with
him
,
because
,
be
young
than
me
,
he
may
be
the
more
apt
to
change
,
and
the
world
may
be
malicious
enough
to
suppose
I
have
practise
upon
his
inexperience
;
but
,
conscious
of
my
own
integrity
,
I
set
slander
at
defiance
,
trust
to
my
own
behaviour
,
and
his
natural
probity
,
for
the
continuance
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
though
we
do
not
live
together
in
the
same
house
,
the
great
part
of
our
time
be
spend
in
each
other
's
company
;
we
dine
and
sup
at
the
same
table
,
frequent
public
place
,
go
upon
party
to
the
country
,
and
never
part
,
but
for
a
few
hour
in
the
night
,
which
we
pass
in
the
utmost
impatience
to
meet
again
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
agreeable
manner
do
the
day
roll
on
,
when
my
felicity
be
interrupt
by
a
fit
of
jealousy
with
which
I
happen
to
be
seize
.
<EOS>
I
have
contract
an
acquaintance
with
a
young
married
lady
,
who
,
though
her
personal
attraction
be
but
slend
,
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
an
agreeable
,
chearful
,
good
-
natured
companion
,
with
a
little
dash
of
the
coquette
in
her
composition
.
<EOS>
this
woman
be
in
very
indigent
circumstance
,
occasion
by
some
loss
her
husband
have
sustain
,
no
sooner
have
an
opportunity
of
see
and
converse
with
my
lover
,
than
she
form
the
design
of
make
a
conquest
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
forgive
her
for
this
scheme
,
whatever
pang
it
may
have
cost
me
,
<EOS>
have
I
believe
it
the
effect
of
real
passion
;
but
I
know
her
too
well
,
to
suppose
her
heart
be
susceptible
of
love
,
and
accordingly
resent
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
execution
of
her
plan
,
she
neglect
nothing
which
she
think
capable
of
engage
his
attention
.
<EOS>
She
take
all
opportunity
of
sit
near
him
at
table
,
ogle
him
in
the
most
palpable
manner
,
direct
her
whole
discourse
to
him
,
trod
upon
his
toe
;
nay
,
I
believe
,
squeeze
his
hand
.
<EOS>
My
blood
boil
at
her
,
though
my
pride
,
for
some
time
,
enable
me
to
conceal
my
uneasiness
;
till
at
length
her
behaviour
become
so
arrogant
and
gross
,
that
I
could
no
longer
suppress
my
indignation
,
and
one
day
tell
my
lover
,
that
I
would
immediately
renounce
his
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
alarm
at
this
unexpected
declaration
;
and
when
he
understand
the
cause
of
it
,
assure
me
,
that
for
the
future
he
would
never
exchange
one
word
with
her
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
this
mark
of
his
sincerity
and
regard
,
I
release
him
from
this
promise
,
which
he
could
not
possibly
keep
,
while
she
and
I
live
upon
any
term
;
and
we
continue
to
visit
each
other
as
usual
,
though
she
still
persist
in
her
endeavour
to
rival
me
in
his
affection
,
and
contract
an
intimacy
with
his
companion
,
who
seem
to
entertain
a
passion
for
her
,
that
she
may
have
the
more
frequent
opportunity
of
be
among
us
;
for
she
have
no
objection
against
favour
the
address
of
both
.
<EOS>
one
evening
,
I
remember
,
we
set
out
in
my
coach
for
the
opera
;
and
in
the
way
,
this
inamorata
be
so
busy
with
her
foot
,
that
I
be
incense
at
her
behaviour
;
and
when
we
arrive
at
the
place
,
refuse
to
alight
;
but
,
set
them
down
,
declare
my
intention
of
return
home
immediately
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
much
pleased
with
this
intimation
,
that
she
could
not
conceal
the
joy
she
feel
at
the
thought
of
converse
with
him
,
uninterrupted
by
my
presence
;
an
opportunity
with
which
I
have
never
favour
her
before
.
<EOS>
this
open
exultation
increase
my
anger
and
anxiety
:
I
go
home
;
but
,
be
still
torture
with
the
reflection
of
have
leave
them
together
,
adjust
myself
in
the
glass
,
though
I
be
too
angry
to
take
notice
of
my
own
figure
,
and
without
farther
delay
return
to
the
opera
.
    
<EOS>
have
inquire
for
the
box
in
which
they
sit
,
I
take
possession
of
one
that
front
them
,
and
reconnoitre
them
,
without
be
perceive
,
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
him
remove
to
as
great
a
distance
from
her
as
the
place
would
permit
,
and
his
head
turn
another
way
.
<EOS>
compose
by
this
examination
,
I
join
them
without
further
scruple
,
when
my
young
gentleman
express
great
joy
at
my
appearance
,
and
tell
me
he
be
determined
to
have
leave
the
entertainment
,
and
come
in
quest
of
me
,
have
not
I
return
at
that
instant
.
    
<EOS>
in
our
way
homeward
,
my
rival
repeat
her
usual
hint
,
and
with
her
large
hoop
almost
overshadow
my
lover
from
my
view
:
upon
which
my
jealousy
and
wrath
recur
with
such
violence
,
that
I
pull
the
string
,
as
a
signal
for
the
coachman
to
stop
,
with
a
view
of
get
out
,
and
go
home
afoot
;
a
step
which
would
have
afford
a
new
spectacle
to
the
people
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
but
I
reflect
,
in
a
moment
,
upon
the
folly
of
such
a
resolution
,
and
soon
recollect
myself
,
by
call
my
pride
to
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
determine
,
however
,
that
she
should
act
no
more
scene
of
this
kind
in
my
presence
,
and
that
same
night
insist
upon
my
lover
's
drop
all
intercourse
and
connexion
with
this
tormentor
.
<EOS>
He
very
chearfully
comply
with
my
desire
,
and
be
even
glad
of
an
occasion
to
break
off
his
acquaintance
with
a
person
about
whom
I
have
plague
him
so
much
.
    
<EOS>
thus
be
I
free
from
the
persecution
of
one
of
those
creature
,
who
,
tho
'
of
little
consequence
in
themselves
,
be
yet
the
pest
of
society
,
and
find
mean
to
destroy
that
harmony
which
reign
between
two
lover
,
by
the
intrusion
of
a
loose
appetite
,
void
of
all
sensibility
and
discretion
:
have
no
feeling
themselves
<EOS>
,
they
can
not
sympathize
with
that
of
other
people
,
and
do
mischief
out
of
meer
wantonness
.
    
<EOS>
My
lover
be
oblige
to
go
to
England
,
have
settle
me
in
a
genteel
house
in
Paris
,
with
a
view
of
return
when
his
affair
should
be
adjust
;
but
when
the
time
of
his
departure
approach
,
he
begin
to
be
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
separation
,
and
,
in
order
to
alleviate
his
anxiety
,
desire
me
to
accompany
him
to
Calais
,
where
we
stay
together
three
or
four
day
,
during
which
the
dread
of
parting
become
more
and
more
intense
:
<EOS>
so
that
we
determine
upon
my
follow
him
into
England
,
by
the
first
opportunity
,
where
I
should
live
altogether
incog
,
that
I
may
be
conceal
from
the
inquiry
and
attempt
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
even
after
this
resolution
be
fix
,
we
part
with
all
the
agony
of
lover
who
despair
of
ever
meet
again
;
and
the
wind
blow
very
high
after
he
have
imbarke
,
increase
my
fear
.
<EOS>
but
by
the
return
of
the
packet
-
boat
,
I
be
bless
with
the
report
of
his
be
safe
arrive
in
England
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
peruse
his
letter
by
every
post
.
    
<EOS>
My
admirer
be
thus
detach
from
me
,
my
thought
be
intirely
employ
in
concert
some
private
method
of
convey
myself
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
I
would
not
trust
myself
in
the
common
packet
,
for
fear
of
be
discover
,
after
have
revolve
diver
scheme
,
I
determine
to
transport
myself
in
one
of
the
dutch
fishing
-
boat
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
know
the
passage
would
be
hazardous
;
but
,
in
a
case
of
such
interesting
concern
,
I
overlook
all
danger
and
inconvenience
.
    
<EOS>
before
I
put
this
resolution
in
practice
,
I
be
so
fortunate
as
to
hear
of
a
small
english
vessel
that
arrive
at
Calais
with
a
prisoner
of
war
,
in
which
I
embark
with
my
companion
,
and
another
lady
,
who
live
with
me
for
some
time
afterwards
;
and
when
we
come
on
board
,
discover
that
the
ship
be
no
other
than
a
light
collier
,
and
that
her
whole
company
amount
to
no
more
than
three
man
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
tho
'
the
sea
be
so
rough
,
and
the
weather
so
unpromising
,
that
no
other
boat
would
venture
to
put
to
sea
,
we
set
sail
,
and
between
two
storm
,
in
about
three
hour
arrive
in
safety
at
Dover
.
    
<EOS>
from
hence
my
first
companion
go
to
her
friend
,
in
the
stage
-
coach
,
while
the
other
lady
and
I
hire
an
open
post
-
chaise
(
tho
'
it
snow
very
hard
)
and
without
any
accident
perform
our
journey
to
London
,
where
I
meet
with
my
lover
,
who
fly
to
my
arm
in
all
the
transport
of
impatient
joy
;
and
,
doubtless
,
I
deserve
his
affection
,
for
the
hardship
,
peril
,
and
difficulty
I
have
undergo
to
be
with
him
;
for
I
never
scruple
to
undertake
any
thing
practicable
,
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
sincerity
of
what
I
profess
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
our
plan
,
I
assume
a
fictitious
name
,
and
never
appear
in
publick
,
be
fully
satisfied
and
happy
in
the
company
and
conversation
of
the
man
I
love
;
and
when
he
go
into
the
country
,
content
myself
with
his
correspondence
,
which
he
punctually
maintain
,
in
a
series
of
letter
equally
sensible
,
sincere
and
affectionate
.
    
<EOS>
upon
his
return
to
town
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
,
he
devote
the
great
part
of
his
time
to
our
mutual
enjoyment
;
leave
me
with
reluctance
,
when
he
be
call
away
by
indispensible
business
,
and
the
civility
which
be
due
to
his
acquaintance
,
and
very
seldom
go
to
any
place
of
publick
entertainment
,
because
I
could
not
accompany
and
share
with
him
in
the
diversion
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
much
do
I
ingross
his
attention
,
that
one
evening
,
after
he
have
be
teize
into
an
agreement
of
meet
some
friend
at
a
play
,
he
go
thither
precisely
at
the
appoint
hour
,
and
as
they
do
not
arrive
punctually
at
the
very
minute
,
he
return
to
me
immediately
,
as
much
rejoice
at
his
escape
as
if
he
have
meet
with
some
signal
deliverance
.
<EOS>
nor
be
his
constancy
inferior
to
the
ardour
of
his
love
:
we
go
once
together
to
a
ball
in
the
Hay
-
market
,
where
,
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
fine
woman
,
whose
charm
be
inhance
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
dress
they
wear
,
he
remain
unshaken
,
unseduced
,
preserve
his
attachment
for
me
,
in
spite
of
all
temptation
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
summer
he
provide
me
with
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
own
;
but
the
accommodation
be
bad
,
and
that
country
afford
no
other
place
fit
for
my
residence
,
he
bring
me
home
to
his
own
seat
,
and
by
that
step
raise
an
universal
clamour
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
see
no
company
,
and
lead
such
a
solitary
life
,
that
nothing
but
excessive
love
could
have
support
my
spirit
:
not
but
that
he
give
me
as
much
of
his
time
as
he
could
possibly
spare
from
the
necessary
duty
of
pay
and
receive
visit
,
together
with
the
avocation
of
hunting
,
and
other
country
amusement
,
which
I
could
not
partake
.
<EOS>
formerly
,
indeed
,
I
use
to
hunt
and
shoot
,
but
I
have
leave
off
both
;
so
that
I
be
now
reduce
to
the
alternative
of
read
and
walk
by
myself
:
but
,
Love
make
up
for
all
deficiency
to
me
,
who
think
nothing
else
worth
the
living
for
!
  
<EOS>
have
I
be
bless
with
a
partner
for
life
,
who
could
have
love
sincerely
,
and
inspire
me
with
a
mutual
flame
,
I
would
have
ask
no
more
of
fate
.
<EOS>
interest
and
ambition
have
no
share
in
my
composition
;
love
which
be
pleasure
,
or
pleasure
which
be
love
,
make
up
the
whole
.
<EOS>
a
heart
so
disposed
can
not
be
devoid
of
other
good
quality
;
it
must
be
subject
to
the
impression
of
humanity
and
benevolence
,
and
enemy
to
nothing
but
itself
.
<EOS>
this
you
will
give
me
leave
to
affirm
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
as
I
have
frankly
own
my
failing
and
misconduct
.
    
<EOS>
towards
the
end
of
summer
my
heart
be
a
little
alarm
by
a
report
that
prevail
,
of
my
lover
's
be
actually
engage
in
a
treaty
of
marriage
:
however
,
I
give
little
credit
to
this
rumour
,
till
I
be
oblige
to
go
to
town
about
business
,
and
there
I
hear
the
same
information
confidently
affirm
.
<EOS>
tho
'
I
still
consider
it
as
a
vague
surmise
,
I
write
to
him
an
account
of
what
I
have
hear
;
and
in
his
answer
,
which
be
still
in
my
possession
,
he
assure
me
,
with
repeat
vow
and
protestation
,
that
the
report
be
altogether
false
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
I
return
to
his
house
;
and
tho
'
the
tale
be
incessantly
thunder
in
my
ear
,
still
believe
it
void
of
all
foundation
,
till
my
suspicion
be
awake
by
a
very
inconsiderable
circumstance
.
    
<EOS>
one
day
,
on
his
return
from
hunting
,
I
perceive
he
have
a
very
fine
pair
of
Dresden
ruffle
on
his
shirt
,
which
I
could
not
suppose
he
would
wear
at
such
a
rustic
exercise
;
and
therefore
my
fear
immediately
take
the
alarm
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
question
him
about
this
particular
of
his
dress
,
his
colour
change
;
and
tho
'
he
attempt
to
elude
my
suspicion
,
by
impute
it
to
a
mistake
of
his
servant
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
rest
satisfied
with
this
account
of
the
matter
,
but
inquire
into
the
truth
with
such
eagerness
and
penetration
,
that
he
could
not
deny
he
have
be
to
make
a
visit
;
and
,
by
degree
,
I
even
extort
from
him
a
confession
,
that
he
have
engage
himself
farther
than
he
ought
to
have
proceed
,
without
make
me
acquaint
with
his
design
,
tho
'
he
endeavour
to
excuse
his
conduct
,
and
pacify
my
displeasure
,
by
say
that
the
affair
would
not
be
bring
to
bear
for
a
great
while
,
and
perhaps
may
never
come
to
a
determination
:
but
he
be
in
great
confusion
,
and
indeed
hardly
know
what
he
say
.
    
<EOS>
I
would
have
quit
his
house
that
moment
,
have
not
he
,
before
-
hand
,
obtain
a
promise
that
I
would
take
no
rash
resolution
of
that
kind
,
and
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
procure
any
method
of
conveyance
by
which
I
could
make
my
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
give
no
vent
to
reproach
,
and
only
upbraid
him
with
his
have
permit
me
to
return
in
ignorance
to
the
country
,
<EOS>
after
I
be
once
fairly
go
:
upon
which
he
swear
that
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
part
with
me
.
<EOS>
this
declaration
be
a
mystery
at
that
time
,
but
I
have
be
since
so
fully
satisfied
of
his
reason
for
his
conduct
,
that
I
heartily
acquit
him
of
all
injustice
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
it
be
my
sincere
opinion
,
that
if
ever
young
man
deserve
to
be
happy
,
he
be
certainly
intitle
to
that
privilege
;
and
,
if
I
may
be
allow
to
judge
,
have
an
heart
susceptible
of
the
most
refined
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
the
violence
of
the
grief
and
consternation
which
I
suffer
from
this
stroke
,
have
a
little
subsided
<EOS>
,
I
deliberate
with
myself
about
the
measure
I
should
take
,
and
determine
to
leave
his
house
some
day
when
he
should
be
abroad
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
encourage
in
this
resolution
by
the
advice
of
our
Scotch
friend
,
who
come
about
this
time
from
London
,
on
a
visit
to
his
fellow
-
traveller
:
we
think
such
an
abrupt
departure
would
be
less
shocking
than
to
stay
and
take
a
formal
leave
of
my
lover
,
whose
heart
be
of
such
a
delicate
frame
,
that
after
I
tell
him
I
should
one
day
withdraw
myself
,
in
his
absence
,
he
never
come
home
from
the
chace
,
or
any
other
avocation
,
without
tremble
with
apprehension
that
I
have
escape
.
    
<EOS>
after
he
have
be
some
time
accustom
to
these
fear
by
my
previous
intimation
,
I
at
length
decamp
,
in
good
earnest
,
tho
'
my
heart
ake
upon
the
occasion
,
because
I
leave
him
love
and
beloved
;
for
his
affection
be
evident
,
notwithstanding
the
step
he
have
take
,
by
the
advice
and
importunity
of
all
his
relation
,
who
lay
a
disagreeable
restraint
upon
his
inclination
,
while
they
consult
his
interest
in
every
other
particular
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
halt
in
the
next
great
town
,
until
I
could
be
supply
with
fresh
horse
,
I
be
visit
by
a
gentleman
who
have
be
formerly
intimate
with
my
lover
;
but
a
breach
have
happen
in
their
friendship
,
and
he
now
come
to
complain
of
the
treatment
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
perceive
that
I
be
not
in
a
humour
to
listen
to
his
story
,
he
shift
the
conversation
to
my
own
,
and
observe
,
that
I
have
be
extremely
ill
use
.
    
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
of
a
different
opinion
:
<EOS>
that
it
be
not
only
just
,
but
expedient
,
that
a
young
man
of
Mr
  
's
fortune
should
think
of
make
some
alliance
to
strengthen
and
support
the
interest
of
his
family
;
and
that
I
have
nothing
to
accuse
him
of
<EOS>
but
his
let
me
remain
so
long
in
ignorance
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
me
to
understand
,
that
I
be
still
ignorant
of
a
great
part
of
the
ill
usage
I
have
receive
,
affirming
,
that
while
I
live
in
his
house
,
he
have
amuse
himself
with
all
the
common
woman
in
that
town
,
to
some
of
whom
this
gentleman
have
personally
introduce
him
.
    
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
could
not
believe
this
imputation
;
but
he
support
his
assertion
with
so
many
convincing
circumstance
,
that
I
could
no
longer
doubt
the
truth
of
them
;
and
I
feel
so
much
resentment
,
that
my
love
vanish
immediately
into
air
.
<EOS>
instead
of
proceed
in
my
journey
to
London
,
I
go
back
a
considerable
way
,
and
send
a
message
,
desire
to
see
him
in
a
little
house
,
about
mid
way
between
his
own
habitation
and
the
town
from
whence
<EOS>
I
come
.
<EOS>
He
obey
my
summon
,
and
appear
at
the
place
appoint
,
where
I
reproach
him
with
great
bitterness
.
<EOS>
He
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
,
so
far
as
acknowledge
that
he
have
correspond
with
other
woman
lately
,
in
order
to
get
the
well
of
his
affection
for
me
,
but
the
experiment
have
fail
,
and
he
find
that
he
should
be
for
ever
miserable
.
    
<EOS>
I
do
not
look
upon
this
candid
confession
as
a
sufficient
atonement
for
his
past
dissimulation
,
and
,
in
the
sharpness
of
my
revenge
,
demand
a
settlement
,
which
he
peremptorily
refuse
;
so
that
,
for
the
present
,
we
hold
each
other
in
the
utmost
contempt
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
afterwards
despise
myself
for
my
condescension
,
which
be
owe
to
the
advice
of
my
companion
,
support
and
inflame
by
the
spirit
of
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
beg
that
I
would
return
to
his
house
,
or
stay
all
night
where
I
be
;
but
I
be
deaf
to
his
intreatie
,
and
,
after
a
great
deal
of
ironical
civility
on
my
side
,
I
take
my
leave
,
and
go
away
;
<EOS>
yet
,
before
I
set
out
,
I
look
back
,
and
see
him
on
horseback
,
with
such
an
air
of
simplicity
and
truth
,
as
call
up
a
profound
sigh
,
notwithstanding
all
that
have
pass
in
our
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
upon
my
arrival
in
London
,
I
take
lodging
in
Leicester
-
Fields
,
and
answer
a
letter
which
I
have
some
month
before
receive
from
my
lord
;
tell
him
,
that
I
would
go
home
to
him
,
without
stipulate
for
any
term
,
to
try
what
effect
my
confidence
would
have
upon
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
He
readily
embrace
the
offer
,
and
take
an
house
in
St
James
's
street
,
where
I
propose
to
comply
with
his
humour
in
every
thing
that
be
consistent
with
my
own
peace
and
tranquillity
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
my
lover
pass
his
time
very
disagreeably
in
the
country
,
with
his
friend
,
of
whom
(
it
seem
)
he
have
conceive
some
jealousy
,
which
be
increase
by
a
letter
I
write
to
that
gentleman
,
till
he
be
make
acquainted
with
the
content
,
which
he
read
over
forty
time
;
and
then
his
passion
break
out
with
more
violence
than
ever
<EOS>
,
he
not
only
express
his
feeling
,
in
an
epistle
which
I
immediately
receive
,
but
when
he
come
to
town
,
suffer
such
agony
of
despair
as
I
have
never
see
before
,
except
in
lord
B
#
#
#
#
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
then
in
my
power
to
have
take
ample
revenge
upon
him
,
as
well
as
upon
my
insolent
rival
,
who
have
insist
upon
my
leave
his
house
,
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
,
tho
'
he
absolutely
refuse
to
gratify
her
malice
;
for
he
be
now
dispose
to
do
any
thing
for
my
satisfaction
:
but
I
know
his
worth
,
and
have
too
much
regard
for
his
reputation
to
advise
him
to
act
inconsistent
with
his
honour
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
many
tender
meeting
and
sorrowful
parting
happen
between
us
,
till
the
marriage
-
knot
be
tie
,
when
he
send
me
a
bank
-
note
for
a
thousand
pound
,
by
way
of
speciman
(
as
he
call
it
)
of
his
friendship
,
and
of
what
he
would
do
for
me
,
should
I
ever
want
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
this
mark
of
his
generosity
I
receive
in
a
most
tender
billet
,
which
I
shall
never
part
with
,
together
with
his
picture
set
in
diamond
.
    
<EOS>
I
now
employ
my
thought
in
keep
measure
with
my
lord
;
we
lie
in
the
same
apartment
,
and
for
the
first
four
or
five
month
I
neither
dine
nor
sup
abroad
,
above
twice
;
and
then
he
know
where
I
be
,
and
approve
of
my
company
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
complacency
and
circumspection
have
no
effect
upon
his
temper
,
which
remain
as
capricious
and
dissatisfied
as
ever
.
<EOS>
nay
,
to
such
a
provoking
degree
do
this
unhappy
humour
prevail
,
that
one
day
,
in
the
presence
of
his
lawyer
,
he
harrangue
upon
my
misconduct
since
our
last
re
-
union
;
and
very
freely
affirm
,
that
every
step
I
have
take
be
diametrically
opposite
to
his
will
.
    
<EOS>
Conscious
of
the
pain
I
have
be
at
to
please
him
<EOS>
,
I
be
so
incensed
at
these
unjust
invective
,
<EOS>
that
start
up
,
I
tell
him
he
be
a
little
dirty
fellow
;
and
would
have
leave
the
house
immediately
,
have
not
his
lawyer
,
and
other
,
who
be
in
the
next
room
,
interpose
,
and
by
dint
of
argument
and
importunity
divert
me
from
my
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
I
have
be
inform
by
a
person
of
rank
,
that
my
lord
discover
exactly
the
same
disposition
in
his
father
's
life
-
time
,
and
only
change
the
subject
of
his
complaint
from
the
word
father
to
that
of
wife
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
take
all
opportunity
of
plague
my
dear
parent
,
as
he
have
just
sagacity
enough
to
know
,
that
this
be
the
most
effectual
way
he
can
take
to
distress
me
.
    
<EOS>
after
repeat
trial
,
I
have
give
up
all
hope
of
make
him
happy
,
or
of
find
myself
easy
in
my
situation
;
and
live
with
him
at
present
to
avoid
a
great
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
not
that
his
ill
-
nature
be
all
the
grievance
of
which
I
complain
:
exclusive
of
the
personal
disgust
I
entertain
for
him
,
his
folly
be
of
that
specie
which
disoblige
rather
than
divert
,
and
his
vanity
and
affectation
altogether
intolerable
;
for
he
actually
believe
himself
,
or
at
least
would
impose
himself
upon
mankind
,
as
a
pattern
in
gallantry
and
taste
;
and
,
in
point
of
business
,
a
person
of
infinite
sagacity
and
penetration
:
but
the
most
ridiculous
part
of
his
character
be
his
pretend
talent
for
politic
,
in
which
he
so
deeply
concern
himself
,
that
he
have
dismiss
many
a
good
servant
,
because
he
suspect
him
of
have
wrong
connexion
;
a
theme
upon
which
he
have
often
quarrel
with
me
,
even
almost
to
part
,
accuse
me
of
hold
correspondence
with
the
earl
of
b
#
#
#
#
and
c
#
#
#
#
,
and
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
v
#
#
#
#
tho
<EOS>
'
I
never
have
the
least
acquaintance
with
any
of
these
gentleman
,
except
the
earl
of
c
#
#
#
#
,
to
whom
I
have
not
speak
for
these
ten
year
past
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
often
be
at
a
loss
to
know
,
whether
he
be
more
mad
or
malicious
in
those
fit
of
enthusiasm
<EOS>
,
wherein
he
seem
transported
with
zeal
for
the
commonwealth
,
and
torment
me
with
his
admonition
,
out
of
all
temper
and
patience
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
I
contrive
an
expedient
which
free
me
from
these
troublesome
expostulation
,
and
silence
him
effectually
on
the
score
of
politick
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
an
open
avowal
of
be
connect
with
all
those
people
whom
I
have
name
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
him
too
well
to
believe
there
be
any
thing
solid
in
his
intention
or
profession
,
even
when
he
carry
them
so
far
as
to
demand
a
private
audience
of
the
K
#
#
#
#
,
in
order
to
communicate
a
scheme
for
suppress
the
rebellion
;
and
that
be
deny
,
sollicite
the
duke
of
d
#
#
#
#
's
interest
,
for
permission
to
raise
and
head
a
regiment
of
kentish
smuggler
:
nay
,
to
<EOS>
such
a
pitch
do
his
loyalty
soar
,
that
he
purchase
a
firelock
of
particular
mechanism
,
calculate
for
the
safety
of
the
bearer
,
in
case
he
have
be
place
centinel
at
his
majesty
's
door
;
and
keep
his
horse
ready
caparison
,
with
a
view
of
attend
his
sovereign
to
the
field
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
these
pompous
preparation
,
have
he
be
put
to
the
proof
,
he
would
have
infallibly
creep
out
of
his
engagement
,
thro
'
some
sneak
evasion
,
his
imagination
be
very
fertile
in
such
saving
pretence
.
<EOS>
yet
he
will
talk
sometimes
so
fervently
,
and
even
sensibly
,
on
the
subject
,
that
a
stranger
would
mistake
him
for
a
man
of
understanding
,
and
determine
zeal
for
the
good
of
his
country
.
    
<EOS>
since
my
last
return
to
his
house
,
that
act
of
parliament
pass
,
by
which
he
be
enable
to
pay
his
debt
,
and
among
the
rest
,
a
thousand
pound
of
my
contracting
,
the
only
burden
of
that
kind
I
ever
intaile
upon
him
,
exclusive
of
my
pin
-
money
,
which
be
never
regularly
pay
;
nor
would
he
have
be
subject
to
this
,
have
he
not
,
by
his
persecution
and
pursuit
,
expose
me
to
an
extraordinary
expence
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
have
it
in
my
power
to
reward
some
of
my
faithful
abigail
;
in
particular
,
to
relieve
from
extreme
distress
that
maid
to
whom
(
as
I
have
already
observe
)
lord
B
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
grant
an
annuity
,
which
she
have
sell
:
so
that
she
be
reduce
to
the
most
abject
poverty
,
and
I
find
her
in
a
dismal
hole
,
with
two
infant
,
perish
for
want
;
a
spectacle
which
draw
tear
from
my
eye
,
and
indeed
could
not
but
make
a
deep
impression
upon
an
heart
like
mine
,
which
the
misery
of
my
fellow
-
creature
never
fail
to
melt
.
    
<EOS>
nor
do
I
,
upon
this
occasion
,
forget
the
attachment
and
fidelity
of
my
other
woman
Mrs
S
#
#
#

,
who
hear
I
be
rob
in
my
passage
thro
'
flander
,
have
generously
relinquish
the
allowance
I
have
settle
upon
her
at
parting
.
    
<EOS>
the
exercise
of
such
act
of
humanity
and
benevolence
,
and
the
pleasure
of
see
my
dear
and
tender
parent
often
,
in
some
measure
alleviate
the
chagrin
to
which
I
be
subject
,
from
the
disagreeable
disposition
of
my
lord
,
who
,
consistent
with
his
former
inconsistency
,
upon
our
last
reconciliation
chearfully
agree
to
a
proposal
I
make
of
have
concert
in
the
house
,
and
even
approve
of
the
scheme
with
mark
of
particular
satisfaction
:
but
before
one
half
of
the
winter
be
expire
,
he
find
mean
to
banish
all
the
company
,
begin
with
lord
R
#
#
#
#
b
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
as
he
walk
up
stair
one
evening
,
be
stop
by
a
footman
,
who
plainly
tell
him
he
have
order
to
say
to
him
in
particular
,
that
his
lordship
be
not
at
home
:
yet
the
very
next
day
perceive
that
nobleman
and
me
walk
together
in
the
park
,
he
join
us
with
an
air
of
alacrity
,
as
if
no
such
thing
have
happen
,
and
even
behave
to
lord
R
#
#
#
#
with
the
most
fawning
complaisance
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
be
equally
absurd
and
impertinent
to
the
rest
of
our
friend
,
who
forsook
us
gradually
,
be
tired
of
maintain
any
friendly
communication
with
such
a
disagreeable
composition
of
ignorance
and
arrogance
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
look
upon
him
as
utterly
incorrigible
;
and
as
fate
hath
subject
me
to
his
power
,
endeavour
to
make
the
bitter
draught
go
down
,
by
detach
myself
,
as
much
as
possible
,
from
the
supposition
that
there
be
any
such
existence
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
I
have
not
fatal
experience
of
the
contrary
,
I
should
be
apt
to
believe
that
such
a
character
be
not
to
be
find
among
the
son
of
man
;
because
his
conduct
be
altogether
unaccountable
by
the
know
rule
and
maxim
of
life
,
and
fall
intirely
under
the
poet
's
observation
,
when
he
say
,
@@@ti
true
,
no
mean
puzzle
more
than
wit
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
have
thus
conclude
her
story
,
to
the
entertainment
of
the
company
,
and
the
admiration
of
Peregrine
,
who
express
his
astonishment
at
the
variety
of
adventure
<EOS>
she
have
undergo
,
which
be
such
as
he
think
sufficient
to
destroy
the
most
hardy
and
robust
constitution
,
and
therefore
infinitely
more
than
enough
to
overwhelm
one
of
her
delicate
frame
;
one
of
the
gentleman
present
,
roundly
tax
her
with
want
of
candour
,
in
suppress
some
circumstance
of
her
life
,
which
he
think
essential
in
the
consideration
of
her
character
.
    
<EOS>
She
redden
at
this
peremptory
charge
,
which
have
an
evident
effect
upon
the
countenance
of
the
whole
audience
,
<EOS>
when
the
accuser
proceed
to
explain
his
imputation
,
by
observe
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
her
narration
,
she
have
omit
to
mention
a
thousand
act
of
uncommon
charity
,
of
which
he
himself
know
her
to
be
guilty
;
that
she
have
conceal
a
great
many
advantageous
proposal
of
marriage
,
which
she
may
have
accept
,
before
she
be
engage
;
that
she
have
not
speak
one
word
of
her
first
husband
's
debt
,
which
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
she
have
pay
out
of
her
own
privy
purse
,
after
her
second
marriage
,
and
on
that
account
receive
the
thank
of
lord
W
#

's
eld
brother
,
who
,
though
he
have
undertake
to
discharge
them
,
delay
the
execution
of
his
purpose
longer
than
she
think
they
should
remain
unpaid
:
and
that
,
in
relate
her
inducement
for
leave
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
(
whether
out
of
forgetfulness
,
or
from
tenderness
to
a
lover
once
so
dear
to
her
,
he
would
not
pretend
to
say
)
<EOS>
she
have
omit
a
very
cogent
motive
for
her
own
conduct
;
for
as
he
have
first
court
her
favour
in
her
rise
fortune
,
and
leave
her
in
its
decline
,
she
could
not
avoid
reflect
,
that
,
after
this
precipitate
re
-
engagement
,
when
the
first
transport
of
their
meeting
be
over
,
he
would
again
act
the
same
conduct
,
as
soon
as
her
tranquillity
should
be
disturb
by
the
persecution
of
her
lord
.
    
<EOS>
the
company
be
agreeably
undeceived
by
this
explanation
;
which
her
ladyship
acknowledge
in
very
polite
term
,
as
a
compliment
equally
genteel
and
unexpected
:
and
our
hero
,
after
have
testify
the
sense
he
have
of
her
complaisance
and
condescension
,
in
regale
him
with
such
a
mark
of
her
confidence
and
esteem
,
take
his
leave
,
and
go
home
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
perplexity
;
for
,
from
the
circumstance
of
the
tale
he
have
hear
,
he
plainly
perceive
,
that
her
ladyship
's
heart
be
too
delicate
to
receive
such
incense
,
as
he
,
in
the
capacity
of
an
admirer
,
could
at
present
pay
;
because
,
though
he
have
in
some
measure
abridge
the
empire
of
Emilia
in
his
own
breast
,
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
restrain
it
so
effectually
,
but
that
it
would
interfere
with
any
other
sovereign
whom
his
thought
should
adopt
:
and
,
unless
lady
 
could
ingross
his
whole
love
,
time
and
attention
,
he
foresee
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
support
the
passion
which
he
may
have
the
good
fortune
to
inspire
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
deter
from
declare
his
love
,
by
the
fate
of
her
former
admirer
,
who
seem
to
have
be
wind
up
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
that
look
more
like
the
effect
of
inchantment
,
than
the
inspiration
of
human
attraction
;
an
extasy
of
passion
which
he
durst
not
venture
to
undergo
;
therefore
resolve
to
combat
with
the
impression
he
have
already
receive
,
and
,
if
possible
,
cultivate
her
friendship
without
solicit
her
affection
:
but
,
before
he
could
fix
upon
this
determination
,
he
desire
to
know
the
predicament
in
which
he
stand
in
her
opinion
;
and
by
the
intelligence
of
Crabtree
,
obtain
in
the
usual
manner
,
understand
that
her
sentiment
of
him
be
very
favourable
,
though
without
the
least
tincture
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
transport
with
joy
,
have
her
thought
of
him
be
of
a
more
tender

though
his
reason
be
better
pleased
with
the
information
he
receive
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
muster
up
the
idea
of
his
first
passion
,
and
set
them
in
opposition
to
those
of
this
new
and
dangerous
attachment
;
by
which
mean

he
keep
the

his

Chapter
LXXXIX
Peregrine
amuse
his
imagination
,
by
slight
incursion
upon
the
territory
of
vice
and
folly
;
reform
a
back
-
slide
brother
,
and
send
a
celebrated
sharper
into
exile
.
   
<EOS>
His
heart
be
thus
,
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
suspend
between
two
object
that
lessen
the
force
of
each
other
's
attraction
,
he
take
this
opportunity
of
enjoy
some
respite
,
and
for
the
present
detach
his
sentiment
from
both
;
resolve
to
indulge
himself
in
the
exercise
of
that
practical
satire
,
which
be
so
agreeable
and
peculiar
to
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
in
this
laudable
determination
he
be
confirm
by
the
repeat
suggestion
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
who
tax
him
with
let
his
talent
rust
in
indolence
,
and
stimulate
his
natural
vivacity
,
with
a
succession
of
fresh
discovery
in
the
world
of
scandal
.
    
<EOS>
thus
reinforce
,
they
take
the
field
,
and
perform
various
exploit
,
to
the
mortification
,
astonishment
and
dismay
of
all
those
coxcomb
,
whether
male
or
female
,
fierce
or
feeble
,
insolent
or
tame
,
that
hang
like
tatter
on
the
skirt
of
gallantry
,
and
bring
the
fashion
into
disgrace
.
<EOS>
as
I
may
trespass
upon
the
patience
of
the
reader
,
in
give
a
minute
detail
of
each
adventure
of
this
kind
which
they
atchieve
,
I
shall
content
myself
with
relate
two
only
,
to
which
indeed
all
the
rest
bear
some
resemblance
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
intelligencer
,
who
(
as
we
have
already
observe
)
be
a
privileged
person
in
all
party
,
happen
one
morning
to
breakfast
with
a
sort
of
a
great
man
,
who
,
with
a
large
stock
of
timorous
superstition
and
exterior
piety
,
have
at
bottom
a
spice
of
carnality
,
which
all
his
religion
could
not
extinguish
.
<EOS>
among
the
rest
of
his
dependant
,
there
be
a
certain
favourite
,
who
by
the
most
assiduous
attention
to
his
humour
,
in
a
course
of
artful
flattery
and
servile
complaisance
,
have
insinuate
himself
so
far
into
his
confidence
and
esteem
,
that
he
now
act
in
the
capacity
of
his
counsellor
and
director
,
both
in
his
spiritual
and
temporal
concern
.
    
<EOS>
this
cunning
parasite
have
discover
his
patron
's
infirmity
,
begin
to
be
afraid
,
that
in
the
instigation
of
the
flesh
,
he
may
be
tempt
to
employ
some
other
agent
for
the
gratification
of
his
appetite
:
and
foresee
that
any
minister
of
this
kind
would
infallibly
prove
a
dangerous
rival
to
him
,
in
the
good
grace
of
his
master
,
he
resolve
to
anticipate
the
misfortune
,
and
,
with
his
other
office
,
monopolize
the
function
of
a
Mercury
,
for
which
his
talent
be
perfectly
well
adapt
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
whole
of
his
task
;
he
know
there
be
certain
qualm
and
scruple
of
conscience
to
be
remove
,
as
well
as
other
motive
of
shyness
and
distrust
,
which
he
durst
not
leave
to
the
operation
of
his
friend
's
own
desire
,
lest
he
should
choose
some
other
confident
;
he
therefore
observe
the
different
season
of
his
constitution
,
and
cull
the
proper
opportunity
of
express
a
relaxation
in
his
sentiment
of
chastity
;
which
be
gratefully
receive
,
he
proceed
in
the
work
of
conversion
,
already
half
effect
by
his
patron
's
own
passion
;
and
in
conclusion
,
find
a
willing
dame
to
quench
this
fire
that
scorch
his
vital
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
overnight
obtain
her
consent
,
and
the
particular
of
their
meeting
be
adjust
,
in
presence
of
Cadwallader
,
lader
,
who
give
his
associate
to
understand
that
,
with
a
view
of
keep
the
rendezvous
secret
and
mysterious
,
as
well
as
of
save
the
lover
that
mutual
confusion
which
the
light
must
have
produce
,
the
scene
of
their
interview
be
lay
in
a
summer
-
house
,
that
stand
at
the
end
of
his
garden
,
to
which
the
lady
and
her
conductor
would
be
admit
in
the
dark
,
through
backdoor
that
should
be
leave
open
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
make
acquainted
with
these
particular
,
together
with
the
hour
of
assignation
,
order
Pipes
to
purchase
a
live
calf
,
and
carry
it
in
a
sack
,
about
the
twilight
,
to
the
back
-
garden
-
door
,
which
our
hero
enter
without
hesitation
,
dispose
himself
and
his
attendant
in
a
dark
alcove
immediately
under
the
summer
-
house
,
where
(
without
disengage
the
animal
from
its
covering
)
he
besmear
its
front
with
liquid
phosphorus
,
and
direct
Tom
to
unveil
,
and
present
it
to
the
company
at
their
approach
,
while
he
himself
abscond
behind
a
pillar
,
from
whence
he
could
view
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
They
have
continue
a
whole
hour
in
this
situation
,
when
they
perceive
by
star
-
light
,
three
person
enter
the
postern
,
and
advance
towards
the
place
where
they
lay
;
upon
which
,
Pipes
begin
to
disentangle
his
charge
,
that
he
may
be
ready
to
play
it
off
at
the
proper
time
;
but
,
as
he
be
not
very
expert
in
this
business
,
the
calf
find
itself
disengage
from
its
confinement
,
spring
all
of
a
sudden
out
of
his
hand
,
and
run
directly
forwards
,
encounter
those
that
approach
,
and
as
it
pass
them
,
utter
a
loud
Baa
.
    
<EOS>
the
gallant
,
whose
passion
be
exalt
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
as
susceptible
of
religious
horror
as
of
love
,
see
such
an
apparition
,
when
he
be
at
the
point
of
indulge
a
criminal
appetite
,
and
hear
the
dreadful
cry
,
accompany
with
the
terrible
word
damnation
,
which
Pipes
,
in
his
peculiar
tone
,
exclaim
from
the
alcove
,
when
the
animal
make
its
escape
;
he
be
seize
with
consternation
and
remorse
,
and
fall
upon
his
face
,
lie
in
all
the
agony
of
terror
,
believe
himself
warn
by
a
particular
message
from
above
.
<EOS>
His
trusty
squire
,
who
be
not
quite
so
visionary
,
recollect
himself
from
the
surprize
he
have
suffer
at
the
first
appearance
of
such
a
glare
phaenomenon
,
which
have
also
such
an
effect
upon
the
lady
,
that
she
run
out
into
the
field
,
scream
all
the
way
:
<EOS>
I
say
,
he
no
sooner
recover
the
faculty
of
reflection
,
which
this
accident
have
for
some
minute
take
away
,
than
he
observe
his
patron
's
prostration
;
and
guess
the
condition
of
his
thought
,
resolve
to
profit
by
his
sagacity
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
lay
himself
gently
down
upon
the
cold
walk
,
and
lie
very
quietly
,
till
the
lover
,
have
in
a
faultre
voice
call
thrice
upon
his
name
,
without
be
favour
with
an
answer
,
raise
himself
up
,
and
come
to
the
spot
,
shake
him
by
the
arm
;
upon
which
he
seem
to
wake
from
his
trance
,
and
in
a
most
penitent
tone
pronounce
a
very
pious
ejaculation
,
which
confirm
the
opinion
of
his
principal
who
ask
him
with
fear
and
tremble
,
if
he
have
hear
the
voice
and
see
the
light
.
<EOS>
be
an
excellent
actor
,
he
reply
with
all
the
mark
of
amazement
,
that
he
be
strike
blind
with
a
gush
of
light
,
far
exceed
that
of
the
sun
at
noon
,
and
his
ear
appal
with
a
voice
,
like
the
sound
of
many
water
,
denounce
damnation
to
those
who
obey
the
lust
of
the
flesh
.
    
<EOS>
the
converted
lover
,
though
he
be
not
sensible
of
such
extraordinary
circumstance
of
visitation
,
implicitly
believe
every
tittle
of
his
account
,
impute
the
difference
of
his
own
perception
to
the
weakness
of
his
organ
,
which
be
sooner
disturb
than
those
of
his
purveyor
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
propose
,
that
they
should
adjourn
to
the
chamber
which
have
be
destine
for
the
scene
of
his
transgression
,
and
with
sorrow
and
contrition
ask
pardon
of
heaven
for
his
intend
offence
,
acknowledge
at
the
same
time
,
the
seasonable
and
salutary
interposition
of
providence
.
<EOS>
this
duty
be
accordingly
perform
,
after
they
have
search
in
vain
for
the
nymph
,
who
(
the
squire
seem
to
think
)
be
convey
by
some
supernatural
mean
from
the
garden
;
for
he
say
,
as
he
lie
intrance
upon
the
ground
,
he
hear
a
rattling
like
the
chariot
of
Aminadab
,
and
the
shriek
of
the
young
woman
gradually
sink
in
a
distant
cadence
,
as
if
she
have
be
transport
through
the
air
.
    
<EOS>
as
this
pair
of
penitent
walk
up
stair
to
the
summer
-
house
,
the
patron
,
in
an
extasy
of
faith
,
pronounce
,
"
after
this
tremendous
scene
,
who
can
be
so
incredulous
,
so
dead
to
all
conviction
,
as
to
doubt
the
miracle
of
the
loaf
and
fish
,
or
the
amazing
circumstance
that
attend
the
conversion
of
St
Paul
?
"
    
<EOS>
while
they
be
employ
in
the
exercise
of
their
devotion
,
our
hero
and
his
attendant
retire
by
the
back
-
door
,
which
open
into
the
field
;
and
while
Pipes
go
in
pursuit
of
his
calf
,
which
have
take
shelter
under
the
wall
,
his
master
proceed
forwards
to
the
place
from
whence
he
have
come
,
where
he
have
agree
to
meet
Cadwallader
,
and
communicate
the
success
of
his
enterprize
,
with
which
he
be
perfectly
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
in
cross
the
field
that
lie
betwixt
him
and
that
part
of
the
town
for
which
he
be
bind
,
he
chance
to
pass
by
a
heap
of
wood
,
upon
which
he
perceive
a
woman
,
tolerably
well
dressed
,
sit
,
and
hold
a
smelling
-
bottle
to
her
nose
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
guess
her
to
be
the
lady
whom
he
have
interrupt
in
her
assignation
;
and
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
some
atonement
for
the
injury
he
have
do
,
he
accost
her
with
great
politeness
and
respect
,
tell
her
,
he
presume
,
from
her
be
in
such
a
solitary
place
,
at
such
an
hour
,
that
she
have
meet
with
some
misfortune
;
and
that
,
if
she
would
put
herself
under
his
protection
,
he
would
defend
her
from
any
farther
insult
.
    
<EOS>
His
conjecture
be
right
;
this
be
the
individual
inamorata
who
have
flee
from
the
garden
,
and
who
be
so
terrified
at
the
vision
,
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
which
she
could
not
comprehend
,
that
she
find
herself
unable
to
proceed
farth
homeward
,
and
sit
down
on
a
log
of
wood
,
to
enjoy
a
little
pause
of
rest
,
and
endeavour
to
recollect
her
dissipated
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
get
the
well
of
her
apprehension
,
which
be
rather
increase
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
loneliness
of
the
place
;
so
that
she
,
without
scruple
,
embrace
the
offer
of
a
person
who
behave
with
such
gentle
address
:
and
as
she
be
enervate
by
fear
,
he
carefully
support
her
in
walk
,
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
encourage
her
all
the
way
with
assurance
of
safety
,
and
express
his
curiosity
to
know
the
adventure
,
in
consequence
of
which
she
have
occasion
for
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
She
speak
very
little
during
her
passage
through
the
field
,
because
,
notwithstanding
his
profession
and
appearance
,
he
be
still
a
stranger
;
and
therefore
she
could
not
be
altogether
easy
,
while
she
think
herself
absolutely
in
his
power
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
they
enter
the
town
,
and
mingle
with
the
concourse
of
people
that
pass
and
repass
through
all
the
street
of
this
metropolis
,
her
diffidence
intirely
vanish
,
and
her
conversation
become
altogether
unreserved
.
    
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
what
have
discompose
her
so
much
in
the
garden
,
now
afford
subject
for
her
mirth
;
and
when
her
conductor
still
repeat
his
desire
of
information
,
she
could
not
help
laugh
heartily
,
at
the
circumstance
which
his
question
recall
.
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
manifestation
of
good
humour
,
he
observe
,
that
as
her
spirit
be
exhaust
by
the
fatigue
and
disquiet
<EOS>
she
have
undergo
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
walk
much
farther
,
and
begg'd
she
would
step
with
him
into
the
next
tavern
,
where
they
may
send
for
an
hackney
-
coach
or
chair
,
in
which
she
would
be
convey
to
her
own
lodging
.
<EOS>
after
much
intreaty
,
she
consent
to
his
proposal
;
and
he
have
the
pleasure
to
see
,
that
she
be
a
very
handsome
young
woman
,
about
the
age
of
eighteen
.
    
<EOS>
the
joy
he
feel
at
this
discovery
lighten
in
his
eye
;
nor
be
she
able
to
conceal
a
certain
alacrity
and
satisfaction
that
appear
in
her
countenance
,
when
she
obtain
a
distinct
view
of
her
protector
's
person
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
be
prevail
upon
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
;
and
Peregrine
presume
upon
his
knowledge
of
her
adventure
,
begin
to
make
love
with
great
vehemence
.
    
<EOS>
at
first
,
she
pretend
to
take
offence
at
his
presumption
;
but
,
perceive
from
certain
insinuation
which
he
artfully
dropp'd
,
that
he
be
better
acquaint
with
her
character
than
she
have
imagine
,
her
shyness
gradually
wear
off
,
and
they
soon
come
to
a
satisfactory
explanation
;
in
the
beginning
of
which
,
he
frankly
unravel
the
whole
mystery
of
the
apparition
:
a
discovery
which
have
almost
prove
fatal
to
her
,
from
the
violence
of
mirth
it
produce
;
and
she
as
candidly
disclose
her
own
private
history
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
,
that
her
lover
's
honourable
agent
have
formerly
live
in
the
house
of
her
mother
,
who
be
a
poor
widow
,
support
her
family
by
let
lodging
;
that
he
have
,
by
the
opportunity
of
familiarity
and
friendship
,
employ
his
art
upon
her
,
and
actually
debauch
this
girl
,
when
she
be
no
more
than
fifteen
year
of
age
;
that
upon
the
remonstrance
of
her
mother
,
who
detect
their
correspondence
,
by
perceive
she
be
with
child
,
he
have
quit
the
house
,
with
an
absolute
refusal
to
provide
for
her
;
so
that
she
be
oblige
to
sue
him
for
the
maintenance
of
the
infant
,
and
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
receive
gallant
in
private
;
though
she
have
always
manage
her
occupation
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
preserve
her
character
unsuspected
in
the
neighbourhood
:
and
lastly
,
that
her
first
seducer
have
lately
renew
his
correspondence
,
by
dint
of
present
and
apology
,
and
procure
her
as
a
virgin
for
his
patron
,
who
have
promise
to
settle
some
small
provision
upon
her
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
comfort
her
for
her
disappointment
,
by
recite
what
he
have
overhear
of
the
conversation
that
pass
in
the
garden
,
after
she
make
her
elopement
;
from
whence
he
infer
,
that
her
interest
would
suffer
no
prejudice
from
that
interruption
;
because
,
in
all
probability
,
her
intended
lover
's
flesh
would
soon
get
the
well
of
the
spirit
again
,
in
spite
of
a
thousand
apparition
;
in
which
case
,
he
would
again
have
recourse
to
her
compliance
;
or
,
should
his
superstition
prevail
,
he
would
look
upon
himself
as
in
duty
and
conscience
bind
,
to
enable
her
,
by
a
suitable
settlement
,
to
withstand
such
temptation
for
the
future
.
    
<EOS>
She
seem
to
concur
with
his
opinion
,
and
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
that
expectation
,
while
our
hero
be
more
and
more
engage
by
her
easy
and
agreeable
deportment
.
<EOS>
Her
conversation
be
that
of
a
gay
libertine
,
who
have
a
good
share
of
sense
and
imagination
,
which
,
with
a
natural
vivacity
,
she
employ
in
accommodate
herself
to
the
humour
of
her
gallant
:
but
his
ear
be
not
disgust
with
the
nauseous
ribaldry
and
vulgar
-
execration
which
characterise
the
discourse
of
those
nymph
,
whose
temporary
endearment
be
solicit
by
the
distinguish
youth
of
this
refined
age
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
this
accidental
meeting
be
productive
of
very
agreeable
consequence
to
both
;
and
an
intimacy
of
intercourse
immediately
commence
,
the
result
of
which
be
,
her
promising
to
reserve
her
favour
for
him
alone
,
till
farth
notice
,
and
to
enter
into
no
measure
with
the
visionary
,
but
such
as
he
should
know
and
approve
.
    
<EOS>
have
pass
the
evening
with
this
new
acquaintance
,
and
inform
himself
of
the
particular
necessary
to
be
know
,
for
the
support
of
the
correspondence
they
have
establish
,
he
favour
her
with
some
mark
of
his
bounty
,
and
repair
to
the
lodging
of
his
friend
Crabtree
,
who
be
so
much
incensed
at
his
breach
of
punctuality
,
that
he
order
himself
to
be
deny
;
and
when
the
young
gentleman
force
his
entrance
into
his
chamber
,
vi
&
armis
,
would
not
open
his
mouth
;
but
assume
the
most
grim
contraction
of
his
countenance
,
sit
in
sullen
silence
,
till
the
circumstance
of
the
adventure
,
which
his
associate
know
how
to
relate
to
the
great
advantage
,
gradually
unbend
his
feature
to
an
involuntary
smile
,
which
soon
dilate
into
an
unrestrained
laugh
,
assure
Peregrine
of
his
forgiveness
and
approbation
:
for
though
(
as
I
have
already
observe
)
<EOS>
this
misanthrope
have
gain
an
absolute
ascendency
over
the
muscle
of
his
face
,
and
,
when
under
the
eye
of
the
world
,
could
laugh
inwardly
,
without
betray
the
least
symptom
of
mirth
,
this
self
-
denial
be
not
exert
without
pain
;
and
therefore
he
,
in
private
,
indemnify
himself
for
the
trouble
he
be
at
,
in
preserve
that
inflexible
gravity
in
public
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
in
the
evening
,
our
adventurer
visit
his
fair
Phillis
,
and
understand
that
she
have
a
message
from
the
new
convert
,
exhort
her
to
repentance
and
reformation
,
and
promise
to
support
her
in
her
laudable
endeavour
,
as
soon
as
she
should
be
dispose
to
begin
the
great
work
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
his
trusty
messenger
have
talk
of
his
patron
's
conversion
in
the
most
ludicrous
term
,
account
for
the
apparition
,
by
affirm
,
that
it
be
no
other
than
a
dog
,
with
a
paper
-
lanthorn
hang
to
his
neck
,
equip
in
that
manner
by
some
prentice
for
their
diversion
;
that
he
have
be
throw
over
the
wall
,
with
a
view
to
frighten
the
servant
of
the
family
;
and
not
like
his
quarter
,
no
sooner
perceive
the
garden
-
door
open
,
than
he
naturally
run
towards
it
,
in
order
to
make
his
escape
.
    
<EOS>
He
likewise
wise
<EOS>
frankly
own
,
that
he
have
,
with
a
view
to
his
own
interest
,
encourage
his
lord
and
master
in
his
superstitious
fear
,
and
even
counsel
him
to
execute
,
in
the
course
of
his
penitence
,
a
plan
which
he
have
formerly
lay
,
of
commence
author
,
and
espouse
in
print
the
cause
of
miracle
,
against
the
child
of
perverseness
and
incredulity
:
and
in
conclusion
,
this
faithful
adviser
have
make
strong
love
on
his
own
score
,
propose
to
maintain
a
correspondence
with
her
,
for
which
she
would
be
amply
recompence
by
the
bounty
of
his
patron
,
whom
he
undertake
to
deceive
with
a
feign
account
of
her
repentance
.
    
<EOS>
the
wench
,
have
an
aversion
to
the
character
of
this
parasite
,
whom
she
have
too
great
reason
to
know
,
instead
of
embrace
his
proposal
with
chearfulness
and
alacrity
,
tell
him
with
an
affected
air
of
severity
,
that
howsoever
his
heart
may
be
harden
against
the
warning
of
heaven
,
she
have
the
internal
comfort
to
find
her
own
breast
touch
with
a
due
sense
of
her
unworthiness
,
and
would
,
by
the
blessing
of
providence
,
imitate
the
salutary
example
of
his
good
friend
,
to
whom
she
intend
to
write
an
account
of
her
inward
working
,
which
she
hope
be
no
other
than
the
motion
of
the
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Mercury
hear
this
unexpected
declaration
,
which
be
deliver
with
a
face
of
pious
resolution
,
immediately
avail
himself
of
that
hypocrisy
,
which
he
possess
to
such
a
consummate
degree
;
and
after
have
protest
with
great
earnestness
,
that
what
he
have
say
,
be
utter
with
a
view
to
try
whether
or
not
she
be
intirely
mortify
to
all
the
lust
of
the
flesh
,
he
applaud
her
determination
with
the
most
lofty
encomium
,
and
admonish
her
to
perseverance
,
in
an
enthusiastic
harangue
;
during
which
,
the
tear
actually
gush
from
his
eye
,
and
his
look
adopt
a
sort
of
wildness
and
extatic
stare
,
as
if
he
have
be
really
transport
.
    
<EOS>
though
she
see
through
the
disguise
,
she
seem
convinced
of
his
sincerity
;
as
a
confirmation
of
which
,
he
give
her
his
purse
,
and
take
his
leave
,
assure
her
that
she
should
never
want
,
so
long
as
she
could
retain
grace
enough
to
persist
in
the
happy
work
she
have
so
righteously
begin
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
approve
of
her
behaviour
,
and
have
instruct
her
with
regard
to
her
future
conduct
,
return
to
his
auxiliary
and
intelligencer
,
with
whom
he
concert
another
stratagem
,
to
be
practise
upon
a
certain
she
-
gamester
of
fashion
,
and
a
french
adventurer
,
who
,
under
the
title
of
count
,
support
with
invincible
effrontery
,
and
a
large
stock
of
finesse
,
have
find
mean
to
introduce
himself
among
the
quality
,
from
many
of
whom
he
have
extract
large
sum
of
money
at
play
.
<EOS>
among
those
whom
he
lay
under
contribution
,
be
this
lady
,
who
with
all
the
inclination
of
a
rank
sharper
,
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
his
superior
talent
,
and
become
his
debtor
for
five
hundred
pound
,
which
she
could
not
pay
without
the
assistance
of
her
husband
,
whom
she
do
not
think
proper
to
inform
of
the
loss
.
<EOS>
She
have
for
some
day
evade
the
demand
of
her
creditor
,
by
diver
specious
pretence
,
which
,
however
,
be
soon
exhausted
;
and
he
grow
so
disagreeably
importunate
,
as
to
threaten
an
application
to
her
lord
,
if
she
would
not
discharge
the
debt
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
be
a
latitudinarian
in
her
principle
,
and
reduce
to
great
perplexity
by
these
menace
,
could
think
of
no
other
expedient
to
extricate
herself
,
than
that
of
practise
upon
the
foreigner
's
heart
,
which
she
accordingly
assail
with
all
the
art
of
coquetry
,
reinforce
by
a
very
agreeable
person
,
to
which
she
have
be
often
indebted
for
sundry
fortunate
event
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
in
all
probability
she
would
have
find
the
count
impregnable
,
have
not
he
,
at
this
crisis
,
luckily
meet
with
such
a
flow
of
success
,
as
elevate
his
fancy
,
and
open
his
heart
to
amorous
impression
.
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
exultation
do
he
first
perceive
,
or
at
least
acknowledge
the
attraction
of
his
debtor
,
to
whom
he
,
in
a
billet
,
declare
his
passion
,
and
frankly
propose
the
alternative
,
which
it
be
her
sole
aim
to
procure
.
    
<EOS>
after
the
necessary
scruple
of
decent
reluctance
,
the
affair
be
compromise
,
in
the
hearing
of
Cadwallader
,
who
report
to
his
associate
,
that
she
have
give
the
count
an
assignation
at
the
house
of
a
discreet
matron
,
who
,
under
the
denomination
of
a
milliner
,
keep
commodious
apartment
for
interview
of
this
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
be
not
unknown
to
this
priestess
of
love
,
no
sooner
receive
this
intelligence
,
than
he
go
and
bespeak
one
of
her
chamber
,
contiguous
to
that
which
the
foreigner
have
choose
for
his
accommodation
;
and
some
time
before
the
hour
of
their
appointment
,
take
possession
of
it
,
accompany
by
Crabtree
,
whom
he
have
dress
in
woman
's
apparel
,
because
the
misanthrope
would
not
run
the
risque
of
be
observe
in
propria
persona
.
    
<EOS>
the
lover
,
true
to
their
contract
,
meet
precisely
at
the
hour
;
the
lady
have
disguise
herself
in
an
ordinary
dishabille
,
with
a
capuchin
,
the
hood
of
which
effectually
conceal
her
countenance
;
and
the
door
of
their
apartment
be
shut
,
the
count
find
himself
on
the
brink
of
enjoy
his
good
fortune
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
Peregrine
,
place
himself
at
the
door
,
pronounce
aloud
,
in
the
very
voice
and
manner
of
her
lord
,
whom
he
personally
know
,
"
stand
firm
upon
your
post
,
Mr
Constable
,
and
take
care
that
none
shall
pass
,
while
I
break
open
the
door
,
and
make
sure
of
the
delinquent
;
for
now
I
think
her
ladyship
be
fairly
catch
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
exclamation
produce
an
instantaneous
effect
in
the
chamber
:
the
count
,
terrify
at
the
prospect
of
immediate
death
or
prosecution
,
run
directly
to
the
window
,
and
throw
up
the
sash
,
would
have
make
his
exit
into
the
street
,
without
ceremony
;
but
my
lady
,
who
never
doubt
that
her
husband
be
at
the
door
,
have
recourse
to
that
presence
of
mind
,
which
never
forsook
her
upon
such
occasion
;
and
seize
her
gallant
by
the
collar
,
exalt
her
voice
,
cry
,
"
rape
!
<EOS>
murder
!
<EOS>
rape
!
<EOS>
ah
villain
!
<EOS>
do
you
attempt
my
virtue
?
<EOS>
be
these
the
lace
you
invite
me
to
come
and
see
?
<EOS>
ah
,
you
beastly
monster
!
<EOS>
help
,
good
people
,
help
!
"
    
<EOS>
the
noise
of
these
outcry
,
(
in
consequence
of
which
Pickle
immediately
retreat
to
his
den
)
alarm
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
whose
reputation
be
at
stake
,
run
up
stair
,
accompany
by
two
chairman
,
who
wait
for
my
lady
below
;
and
the
door
be
burst
open
by
her
direction
,
they
find
her
ladyship
in
a
violent
agitation
,
hold
fast
by
the
count
,
who
stand
without
his
perriwig
,
shake
from
head
to
foot
,
in
all
the
agony
of
horror
and
dismay
.
    
<EOS>
My
lady
,
find
herself
deliver
from
the
attempt
of
this
ravisher
,
sink
down
upon
the
couch
in
a
swoon
;
and
while
the
matron
of
the
house
administer
to
her
nostril
,
the
chairman
secure
the
poor
gallant
,
whose
faculty
be
actually
suppress
by
the
extasy
of
his
fear
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
have
a
little
recollected
her
spirit
,
and
look
around
,
without
perceive
her
husband
,
conclude
that
he
be
satisfied
of
her
innocence
,
by
the
artifice
of
her
behaviour
,
and
omit
to
shew
himself
,
that
she
may
not
be
shock
at
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
,
she
renew
her
clamour
against
the
count
,
whom
she
revile
with
the
epithet
of
perfidious
wretch
,
and
abominable
ruffian
;
and
express
her
doubt
about
the
honesty
of
the
house
,
to
which
(
she
say
)
<EOS>
he
have
decoy
her
,
on
pretence
of
shew
some
lace
of
a
new
pattern
,
that
the
milliner
have
receive
from
abroad
.
    
<EOS>
the
landlady
be
no
stranger
to
her
person
or
character
,
and
therefore
have
never
doubt
the
truth
of
the
count
's
information
,
when
he
make
her
privy
to
the
nature
of
this
interview
;
but
her
ladyship
's
present
behaviour
,
(
the
true
cause
of
which
she
do
not
know
)
intirely
alter
her
opinion
;
and
she
now
believe
,
that
the
count
intend
to
have
make
her
house
the
scene
of
a
rape
in
good
earnest
.
<EOS>
this
suggestion
divest
her
of
all
regard
for
her
customer
,
against
whom
she
exclaim
with
great
virulence
,
as
a
person
who
have
endeavour
to
intail
the
curse
of
infamy
upon
her
house
;
and
assure
the
plaintiff
,
that
he
have
hire
the
apartment
for
a
young
lady
,
whom
he
pretend
to
have
privately
espouse
,
without
the
consent
of
her
parent
,
from
whose
inquiry
he
have
reason
to
conceal
the
place
of
her
abode
.
    
<EOS>
the
rueful
foreigner
,
bait
with
their
joint
invective
,
and
more
than
half
distract
with
the
terror
of
an
english
jury
,
never
dream'd
of
attempt
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
imputation
he
have
incur
;
because
he
imagine
the
whole
affair
be
the
result
of
a
conspiracy
against
his
life
and
fortune
;
but
fall
upon
his
knee
before
his
accuser
,
in
the
most
suppliant
manner
,
implore
her
pardon
,
which
he
offer
to
acknowledge
by
a
present
of
a
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
have
these
term
be
seasonably
propose
,
matter
would
soon
have
be
bring
to
an
accommodation
;
but
she
could
not
decently
enter
into
a
treaty
with
him
,
in
presence
of
such
witness
;
and
besides
,
she
believe
herself
still
under
the
inspection
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
reject
his
proffer
with
disdain
,
observe
,
that
his
guilt
be
of
such
a
nature
,
as
to
preclude
all
hope
of
forgiveness
;
and
order
the
chairman
to
take
charge
of
his
person
,
until
he
should
be
take
into
custody
by
an
officer
properly
authorize
.
    
<EOS>
have
give
these
direction
,
at
which
the
poor
prisoner
wring
his
hand
in
horror
and
despair
,
she
withdraw
with
the
matron
into
another
room
,
in
expectation
of
be
visit
by
her
husband
;
and
after
have
wait
some
time
with
manif
impatience
,
could
not
forbear
ask
if
there
be
any
other
lodger
in
the
house
:
when
the
landlady
reply
in
the
negative
,
she
begin
to
sift
her
with
a
variety
of
question
,
in
the
course
of
which
she
learn'd
,
that
not
a
soul
have
enter
the
house
after
her
own
arrival
;
and
then
conjecture
,
that
the
voice
she
have
mistake
for
her
husband
's
,

whom
her
cry

though
she
be
at

very
well
satisfied
to

upon

for
the
severity

his
behaviour

him
at
liberty

make
their

so
that
her

's
scheme
prove
abortive
,
and
she
be
fain
to
retire
to
her

meditate
further
vengeance
upon
the
fugitive

who
do
not

shilling
and
half
crown

they
drop
off

<EOS>
the
first
person
of
this
specie
who
appear
be
dress
like
the
wife
of
a
substantial
tradesman

but
this
disguise
could
not
screen
her
from
the
penetration
of
the
conjurer

who
at
first
sight
know
her
to
be
one
of
the
lady
of
whose
come
he
have
be
apprize
by
Peregrine
,
on
the
supposition
that
their
curiosity
be
rather
inflame
than
allay
by
the
intelligence
they
have
receive
from
his
first
client
.
<EOS>
this
lady
approach
the
philosopher
with
that
intrepidity
of
countenance
so
conspicuous
in
matron
of
her
dignified

in
a
soft
voice
,
ask

a
simper

<EOS>
the
necromancer

well

forthwith
deliver
his
response
in
the
following
question
,
write
in

form
,
"
how
long

as

with
a
great
share

that
fortitude
which

by
the
appellation
of
effrontery

exhibit
some
sign
of
shame
and
confusion
at
the
receit
of
this
oracular
interrogation
,
by
which
she
be
convince
of
his
extraordinary
intelligence

and
accost
him
in
a
very
serious
tone
,
"
Doctor
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
you
be
a
person
of
great
ability
in
the
art
you
profess
;
and
therefore
,
without
pretend
to
dissemble
,
I
will
own
you
have
touch
the
true
string
of
my
apprehension
.
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
I
need
not
be
more
particular
in
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
purse
of
money
;
take
it
,
and
deliver
me
from
a
most
alarming
and
uneasy
suspence
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
deposit
her
offering
upon
the
table
,
and
wait
for
his
answer
with
a
face
of
fearful
expectation
,
while
he
be
employ
in
write
this
sentence
for
her
perusal
:
"
tho
'
I
see
into
the
womb
of
time
,
the
prospect
be
not
perfectly
distinct
;
the
seed
of
future
event
lie
mingle
and
confused
:
so
that
I
be
under
the
necessity
of
assist
my
divination
in
some
case
,
by
analogy
and
human
intelligence
;
and
can
not
possibly
satisfy
your
present
doubt
,
unless
you
will
condescend
to
make
me
privy
to
all
those
occurrence
which
you
think
may
have
interfere
with
the
cause
of
your
apprehension

"
    
<EOS>
the
lady
have
read
the
declaration
,
affect
a
small
emotion
of
shyness
and
repugnance
,
and
seat
herself
upon
a
settee
,
after
have
cautiously
inform
herself
of
the
privacy
of
the
apartment

give
such
a
detail
of
the
succession
of
her
lover

as
amazed
while

entertain
the
necromancer

as
well
as
his
friend
Pickle

who
from
a
closet
in
which
he
have
conceal
himself
,
overhear
every
syllable
of
her
confession
.
<EOS>
Cadwallader
listen
to
her
story
with
a
look
of
infinite
importance
and
sagacity
,
and
after
a
short
pause
tell
her
,
that
he
would
not
pretend
to
give
a
categorical
answer
,
until
he
should
have
deliberate
maturely
upon
the
various
circumstance
of
the
affair
;
but
if
she
would
take
the
trouble
of
honour
him
with
another
visit
on
his
next
public
day
,
he
hope
he
should
be
able
to
give
her
full
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
Conscious
of
the
importance
of
her
doubt
,
she
could
not
help
commend
his
caution
,
and
take
her
leave
,
with
a
promise
of
return
at
the
appoint
time
;
then
the
conjurer
be
join
by
his
associate
,
they
give
a
loose
to
their
mirth
,
which
have
indulge
,
they
begin
to
concert
measure
for
inflict
some
disgraceful
punishment
on
the
shameless
and
insatiate
termagant
who
have
so
impudently
avow
her
own
prostitution
.
    
<EOS>
They
be
interrupt
,
however
,
in
their
conference
,
by
the
arrival
of
a
new
guest
,
who
be
announce
by
Hadgi
<EOS>
,
our
hero
retreat
to
his
lurking

place
,
and
Cadwallader
resume
his
mysterious
appearance
.
<EOS>
this
new
client
,
tho
'
she
hide
her
face
in
a
mask
,
could
not
conceal
herself
from
the
knowledge
of
the
conjurer
,
who
by
her
voice
recognize
her
to
be
an
unmarried
lady
of
his
own
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
within
a
small
compass
of
time
,
make
herself
remarkable
for
two
adventure
,
which
have
not
at
all
succeed
to
her
expectation
:
be
very
much
addict
to
play
,
she
have
,
at
a
certain
route
,
indulge
that
passion
to
such
excess
,
as
not
only
get
the
well
of
her
justice
,
but
also
of
her
circumspection
;
so
that
she
be
unfortunately
detect
in
her
endeavour
to
appropriate
to
herself
what
be
not
lawfully
her
due
.
<EOS>
this
small
slip
be
attend
with
another
indiscretion
,
which
have
likewise
an
unlucky
effect
upon
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
favour
with
the
address
of
one
of
those
hopeful
heir
who
swarm
and
swagger
about
town
,
under
the
denomination
of
Bucks
;
and
in
the
confidence
of
his
honour
consent
to
be
one
of
a
partie
that
make
an
excursion
as
far
as
Windsor
,
think
herself
secure
from
scandal
by
the
company
of
another
young
lady
,
who
have
also
condescend
to
trust
her
person
to
the
protection
of
her
admirer
.
    
<EOS>
the
two
gallant
,
in
the
course
of
this
expedition
,
be
say
to
use
the
most
perfidious
mean
to
intoxicate
the
passion
of
their
mistress
,
by
mix
drug
with
their
wine
,
which
inflame
their
constitution
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
fall
an
easy
sacrifice
to
the
appetite
of
their
conductor
,
who
,
upon
their
return
to
town
,
be
so
base
and
inhuman
as
to
boast
among
their
companion
of
the
exploit
they
have
atchieve
.
<EOS>
thus
the
story
be
circulate
,
with
a
thousand
additional
circumstance
to
the
prejudice
of
the
sufferer
,
one
of
whom
have
think
proper
to
withdraw
into
the
country
,
until
the
scandal
raise
at
her
expence
should
subside
;
while
the
other
,
who
be
not
so
easily
put
out
of
countenance
,
resolve
to
outface
the
report
,
as
a
treacherous
aspersion
,
invent
by
her
lover
as
an
excuse
for
his
own
inconstancy
;
and
actually
appear
in
public
,
as
usual
,
till
she
find
herself
neglect
by
the
great
part
of
her
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
disgrace
,
which
she
know
not
whether
to
impute
to
the
card
affair
,
or
to
the
last
faux
pas
she
have
commit
,
she
now
come
to
consult
the
conjurer
,
and
signify
her
errand
,
by
ask
whether
the
cause
of
her
present
disquiet
be
of
the
town
or
country
?
<EOS>
cadwallader
at
once
perceive
her
allusion
,
answer
her
question
in
these
term
.
<EOS>
"
this
honest
world
will
forgive
a
young
gamester
for
indiscretion
at
play
,
but
a
favour
grant
to
a
blabbing
coxcomb
be
an
unpardonable
offence
.
"
<EOS>
this
reponse
she
receive
with
equal
astonishment
and
chagrin
;
and
,
fully
convince
of
the
necromancer
's
omniscience
,
implore
his
advice

retrieval
of
her
reputation
:
upon
which
he

her
to

and
she
seem
so
well
pleased
with
his
admonition
,
that
she
gratify
him
with
a
double
fee
,
and
drop
a
low
curt'sy
,
retire
.
    
<EOS>
Our
undertaker

think
it
high
time
to
silence
the
oracle
for
the
day
,
and
Hadgi
be
accordingly

but
also
employ
inferior

Peregrine

proceed
in
the
exercise
of
the
mystery
of
fortune
-
telling

in
the
course
of
which

<EOS>

preliminary
be
adjust

our
hero
forthwith
repair
to
a
card
assembly
,
which
be
frequent
by
some
of
the
most
notable
gossip
in
town
,
and
have
artfully
turn
the
conversation
upon
the
subject
of
the
fortune
-
teller
,
whose
talent
he
pretend
to
ridicule
,
incense
their
itch
of
know
secret
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
their
curiosity
become
flagrant
,
and
he
take
it
for
grant
,
that
all
or
some
of
them
would
visit
Albumazar
on
his
very
first
visiting
-
day

<EOS>
while

be
thus
engage
,
his
associate
make
his
appearance
in
another
convocation
of
fashionable
people
,
where
he
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
hear
the
conjurer
bring
upon
the
carpet
by
an
elderly
gentlewoman
,
remarkable
for
her
inquisitive
disposition
,
who
address
herself
to
Cadwallader
,
ask
,
by
the
help
of
the
finger

,
if
he
know
any
thing
of
the
magician
that
make
such
a
noise
in
town
?
<EOS>
the
misanthrope
answer
as
usual
,
in
a
surly
tone
,
"
by
your
question
you
must
either
take
me
for
a
pimp
or
an
ideot

what

in

name
of

should
I
know
of
such
a
rascal

unless
I
be
to
court
his
acquaintance
with
a
view
to
feast
my
own
spleen
,
in
see
him
fool
the
whole
nation
out
of
their
money

<EOS>
tho

I
suppose

his
chief
profit
arise
from
his
practice

in
quality
of
pander

all

teller
be
bawds

for
that
reason

so
much
follow
by
people
of

<EOS>
this
fellow
(
I
warrant
)
have
get
sundry
convenient
apartment
for
the
benefit
of
procreation

for
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
those
who
visit
him
on
the
pretence
of
consult
his
supernatural
art
,
can
be
such
fool
,
such
driveler

as
to
believe
that
he
can
actually
prognosticate
future

"
    
<EOS>
the
company
,
accord
to
his
expectation

impute
his
remark
to
the
rancour
of
his
disposition
,
which
could
not
bear
to
think
that
any
person
upon
earth
be
wise
than
himself
;
and
his
ear
be
regale
with
a
thousand
instance
of
the
conjurer

wonderful
prescience
,
for
which
he
be
altogether

<EOS>
some
of
these

They

will

see
him
very
much

positively

take

the

to

the
story

three
black

which
they
consider
as
an
impromptu
of
Cadwallader

to

that
she
have
hear
much
of
his
great

commend
his

a
smile
;

,
satisfied
of

express
a

upon
the
private
history
of

great

happen
to

,
in

dropt
such
artful
hint

be
amazed
at

actually
ask

communicable

<EOS>
the

reply
in
the
affirmative
;

,
at

give
her
to
understand

that
it
be
attainable

She
not

seem
to
doubt
the
truth

tell
him

with
a
look
of
disdain

that
his
art
be
not
worth
have
,

could
not

it
for

pleasure

even
penetration

"
    
<EOS>
Our
necromancer
,
perplex
at
this
rencounter
,
make
no
reply
;
but
take
up
his
wand
,
wave
it
around
his
head
in
a
very
mysterious
motion
,
with
a
view
of
intimidate
these
forward
visitant
,
who
,
far
from
be
awe
by
this
sort
of
evolution
,
become
more
and
more
obstreperous
,
and
even
threaten
to
pull
him
by
the
beard
,
if
he
would
not
immediately
comply
with
their
desire
.
    
<EOS>
have
he
call
his
associate
,
or
even
Hadgi
,
to
his
aid
,
he
know
he
could
have
soon
calm
their
turbulence
;
but
,
be
unwilling
to
run
the
risque
of
a
discovery
,
or
even
of
a
riot
,
he
bethink
himself
of
chastise
their
insolence
in
another
manner
that
would
be
less
hazardous
,
and
rather
more
effectual
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
suggestion
,
he
point
his
wand
towards
the
door
of
the
apartment
in
which
the
lady
have
take
sanctuary
;
and
the
two
rake
,
understand
the
hint
,
rush
in
without
hesitation
.
    
<EOS>
the
female
find
their
place
of
retreat
take
by
assault
,
run
about
the
room
in
great
consternation
,
and
be
immediately
take
prisoner
by
the
assailant
,
who
pull
them
towards
the
window
,
open
the
shutter
at
the
same
instant
of
time
,
when
(
strange
to
tell
!
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
hero
discover
,
in
the
prize
he
have
make
,
the
very
wife
of
his
bosom
;
and
his
companion
perceive
that
he
have
stumble
in
the
dark
upon
his
own
mother
.
<EOS>
Their
mutual
astonishment
be
unspeakable
at
this
eclaircissement
,
which
produce
an
universal
silence
for
the
space
of
several
minute
;
and
during
this
pause
the
lady
have
recollect
themselves
,
an
expostulation
be
begin
by
the
elder
of
the
two
,
who
roundly
take
her
son
to
task
for
his
disorderly
life
,
which
lay
her
under
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
watch
his
motion
,
and
detect
him
in
such
an
infamous
place
.
    
<EOS>
while
the
careful
mother
thus
exercise
her
talent
for
reprehension
,
the
hopeful
young
gentleman
,
with
an
hand
in
each
fob
,
stand
whistle
an
opera
-
tune
,
without
seem
to
pay
the
most
profound
regard
to
his
parent
's
reproof
:
and
the
other
lady
,
in
imitation
of
such
a
consummate
pattern
,
begin
to
open
upon
her
husband
,
whom
she
bitterly
reproach
with
his
looseness
and
intemperance
,
demand
to
know
what
he
have
to
alledge
in
alleviation
of
his
present
misconduct
.
<EOS>
the
surprize
occasion
by
such
an
unexpected
meeting
have
already
in
a
great
measure
destroy
the
effect
of
the
wine
he
have
so
plentifully
drink
,
and
the
first
use
he
make
of
his
recover
sobriety
,
be
to
revolve
within
himself
the
motive
that
could
possibly
induce
his
wife
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
good
reason
to
believe
she
be
utterly
void
of
jealousy
,
he
naturally
place
this
rencontre
to
the
account
of
another
passion
;
and
his
chagrin
be
not
at
all
impair
by
the
effrontery
with
which
she
now
presume
to
reprimand
him
.
<EOS>
He
listen
to
her
,
therefore
,
with
a
grave
,
or
rather
grim
aspect
;
and
to
the
question
with
which
she
conclude
her
rebuke
,
answer
with
great
composure
,
"
all
that
I
have
to
alledge
,
madam
,
be
that
the
bawd
have
commit
a
mistake
,
in
consequence
of
which
we
be
both
disappointed
:
and
so
,
lady
,
your
humble
servant
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
retire
with
manifest
confusion
in
his
look
;
and
as
he
pass
through
the
audience
-
chamber
,
eye
the
conjurer
askance
,
pronounce
the
epithet
of
precious
rascal
,
with
great
emphasis
.
<EOS>
mean
while
,
the
junior
,
like
a
dutiful
child
,
hand
his
mamma
to
her
chair
;
and
the
other
client
,
after
have
revile
the
necromancer
,
because
he
could
not
foresee
this
event
,
go
away
in
a
state
of
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
the
coast
be
clear
,
Peregrine
come
forth
from
his
den
,
and
congratulate
his
friend
upon
the
peaceable
issue
of
the
adventure
which
he
have
overhear
:
<EOS>
but
,
that
he
may
not
be
expose
to
such
inconvenience
for
the
future
,
they
resolve
,
that
a
grate
should
be
fix
in
the
middle
of
the
outward
door
,
through
which
the
conjurer
himself
should
reconnoitre
all
the
visitant
,
before
their
admission
;
so
that
,
to
those
whose
appearance
he
should
not
like
,
Hadgi
should
,
without
open
,
give
notice
,
that
his
master
be
engage
.
<EOS>
by
this
expedient
too
,
they
provide
against
those
difficulty
which
Cadwallader
must
have
encounter
,
in
give
satisfaction
to
stranger
,
whom
he
do
not
know
;
for
the
original
intention
of
the
founder
be
to
confine
the
practice
of
their
art
to
people
of
fashion
only
,
most
of
whom
be
personally
know
to
the
counterfeit
magician
and
his
coadjutor
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
,
these
associate
,
Cadwallader
in
particular
,
notwithstanding
his
boasted
insight
into
the
character
of
life
,
never
imagine
that
his
pretended
skill
would
be
consult
by
any
but
the
weak
-
mind
of
the
female
sex
,
incite
by
that
spirit
of
curiosity
which
he
know
be
implant
in
their
nature
:
but
,
in
the
course
of
his
practice
,
he
find
himself
cultivate
in
his
preternatural
capacity
,
by
people
of
all
sex
,
complexion
,
and
degree
of
reputation
,
and
have
occasion
to
observe
,
that
when
the
passion
be
concerned
,
howsoever
cool
,
cautious
and
deliberate
,
the
disposition
may
otherwise
be
,
there
be
nothing
so
idle
,
frivolous
,
or
absurd
,
to
which
they
will
not
apply
for
encouragement
and
gratification
.
    
<EOS>
the
last
occurrence
,
accord
to
the
hope
and
expectation
of
the
confederate
,
be
whisper
about
by
the
lady
concern
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
whole
affair
be
,
in
a
few
day
,
the
universal
topic
of
discourse
,
in
which
it
be
retail
with
numberless
embellishment
,
invent
by
the
party
themselves
,
who
have
long
indulge
a
pique
at
each
other
,
and
take
this
opportunity
of
enjoy
their
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
these
incident
,
while
they
regale
the
spleen
,
at
the
same
time
augment
the
renown
of
the
conjurer
,
who
be
describe
on
both
side
as
a
very
extraordinary
person
in
his
way
;
and
the
alteration
in
his
door
be
no
sooner
perform
,
than
he
have
occasion
to
avail
himself
of
it
,
against
the
intrusion
of
a
great
many
,
with
whom
he
would
have
find
it
very
difficult
to
support
the
fame
he
have
acquire
.
    
<EOS>
among
those
who
appear
at
his
grate
,
he
perceive
a
certain
clergyman
,
whom
he
have
long
know
an
humble
attendant
on
the
great
,
and
with
some
the
repute

their
pleasure

this
Levite

disguise
himself
in
a
great

quite
foreign

himself
as
a
country
squire
upon
the
conjurer

who
call
him
by
his
name

him
to
sit
down
.

this
reception
correspond
with
the
report
he
have
hear
,
touch
our
magician
's
art
,
the
doctor
say
he
would
lay
aside
all
dissimulation
;
and
after
have
profess
an
implicit
belief
,
that
his
supernatural
knowledge
do
not
proceed
from
any
communication
with
evil
spirit
,
but
be
the
immediate
gift
of
heaven
,
he
declare
the
intention
of
his
coming
be
to
inquire
into
the
health
of
a
good
friend
and
brother
of
his
,
who
possess
a
certain
living
in
the

to
know
what
space
of
time
be
allot
to
him
in
this
frail
state
of
mortality
,
that
he
may
have
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
attend
him
in
his
last
moment
,
and
assist
him
in
his
preparation
for
eternity

the

at
once
perceive
the

this
question
,
after
a
solemn
pause

during

seem
absorpt
in
contemplation

deliver
this
response
to

<EOS>
Alarmed
at
this
alteration
,
the
seller
come
to
consult
Cadwallader
not
only
about
the
life
of
the
annuitant
,
but
also
concern
the
state
of
his
health
at
the
time
of
his
purchase
the
annuity
,
purpose
to
sue
the
physician
for
false
intelligence
,
should
the
conjurer
declare
that
the
young
man
be
find
,
when
the
doctor
pronounce
him
disease
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
piece
of
satisfaction
he
do
not
obtain
from
the
misanthrope
,
who
,
in
order
to
punish
his
sordid
disposition
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
the
physician
have
tell
him
the
truth
,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
;
and
that
the
young
gentleman
be
in
a
fair
way
of
attain
a
comfortable
old
age
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
to
say
(
cry
the
client
,
in
the
impatience
of
his
mortification
at
this
answer
)
bate
accident
;
for
,
thank
God
,
the
annuitant
do
not
lead
the
most
regular
life
:
besides
,
I
be
credibly
inform
he
be
choleric
and
rash
;
so
that
he
may
be
concern
in
a
duel
:
then
there
be
such
thing
as
riot
in
the
street
,
in
which
a
rake
's
skull
may
be
casually
crack
;
he
may
be
overturn
in
a
coach
,
overset
in
the
river
,
throw
from
a
vicious
horse
,
overtake
with
a
cold
,
endanger
by
a
surfeit
;
but
what
I
place
my
chief
confidence
in
,
be
an
hearty
pox
,
a
distemper
which
hath
be
fatal
to
his
whole
family
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
the
issue
of
all
these
thing
be
uncertain
;
and
expedient
may
be
find
,
which
would
more
effectually
answer
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
know
they
have
art
in
India
,
by
which
a
man
can
secure
his
own
interest
,
in
the
salutation
of
a
friendly
shake
by
the
hand
;
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
you
who
have
live
in
that
country
,
be
master
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
if
you
be
incline
to
communicate
such
a
nostrum
,
there
be
abundance
of
people
who
would
purchase
it
,
at
a
very
high
price
.
"
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
understand
this
insinuation
,
and
be
tempt
to
amuse
him
in
such
a
manner
as
would
tend
to
his
disgrace
and
confusion
;
but
,
consider
that
the
case
be
of
too
criminal
a
nature
to
be
tamper
with
,
he
withstand
his
desire
of
punish
this
rapacious
cormorant
any
other
way
than
by
tell
him
,
he
would
not
impart
that
secret
for
his
whole
fortune
ten
time
double
;
so
that
the
usurer
retire
,
very
much
dissatisfied
with
the
issue
of
his
consultation

<EOS>
the
next
person
who
present
himself
at
this
altar
of
intelligence
,
be
an
author
,
who
recommend
himself
to
a

by
observe
that
a
prophet

be
know
by
the

appellation
among
the
antient

and
that
,
at
this
day
,
both
the
one
and
the
other
speak
by
inspiration

<EOS>
the
conjurer
refuse
to
own
this
affinity
,
which
,
he
say
,
formerly
subsist
,
because
both
specie
of
the
Vates
be
the
child
of
fiction
;
but
as
he
himself
do
not
fall
under
that
predicament
,
he
beg
leave
to
disown
all
connexion
with
the
family
of
the
poet

the
poor
author
would
have
be
dismiss
without

offer
to
leave
an
ode

have
not
Cadwallader

curiosity
prompt
him
to

this
gentleman

inquiry

<EOS>
He
therefore
tell
him
,
that
in
consideration
of
his
genius
,
he
would
for
once
satisfy
him
,
without
a

desire
him
to

the

he
wish

the

glad
of
this
condescension

for
which
he
thank
the

chapter
XCII
<EOS>
the
conjurer
and
his
associate
execute
a
plan
of
vengeance
against
certain
infidel
who
pretend
to
despise
their
art
;
and
Peregrine
atchieve
an
adventure
with
a
young
nobleman
.
   
<EOS>
by
these
mean
,
the
whole
variety
of
character
undisguised
,
pass
as
it
be
in
review
before
the
confederate
,
who
,
by
diver
ingenious
contrivance
,
punish
the
most
flagrant
offender
with
as
much
severity
as
the
nature
of
their
plan
would
allow
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
they
project
a
scheme
for
chastise
a
number
of
their
own
acquaintance
,
who
have
all
along
profess
the
utmost
contempt
for
the
talent
of
this
conjurer
,
which
they
endeavour
to
ridicule
in
all
company
,
where
his
surprising
art
be
the
subject
of
discourse
;
not
that
they
have
sense
and
discernment
enough
to
perceive
the
absurdity
of
his
pretension
,
but
affect
a
singularity
of
opinion
,
with
a
view
of
insult
the
inferior
understanding
of
those
who
be
deceive
by
such
an
idle
impostor
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
indeed
,
for
obvious
reason
,
have
always
espouse
their
judgment
in
this
case
,
and
join
them
in
revile
the
public
character
of
his
friend
;
but
he
know
how
far
the
capacity
of
those
virtuosi
extend
,
and
have
frequently
catch
them
in
the
fact
of
recount
their
exploit
against
the
conjurer
,
which
be
the
production
of
their
own
invention
only
.
<EOS>
on
these
consideration
,
his
wrath
be
kindle
against
them
,
and
he
accordingly
concert
measure
with
his
coadjutor
,
for
overwhelm
them
with
confusion
and
dismay
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
a
report
be
spread
by
his
emissary
,
that
the
magician
have
undertake
to
entertain
the
view
with
the
appearance
of
any
person
whom
his
customer
should
desire
to
see
,
whether
dead
,
or
at
the
distance
of
a
thousand
league
.
<EOS>
this
extraordinary
proposal
chance
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
,
in
a
place
where
most
of
those
infidel
be
assemble
,
they
talk
of
it
in
the
usual
stile
,
and
some
of
them
swear
,
the
fellow
ought
to
be
pillory'd
for
his
presumption
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
seize
this
favourable
opportunity
,
acquiesce
in
their
remark
,
and
observe
with
great
vehemence
,
that
it
would
be
a
meritorious
action
to
put
the
rascal
to
the
proof
,
and
then
toss
him
in
a
blanket
for
non
-
performance
.
<EOS>
They
be
wonderfully
pleased
with
this
suggestion
,
and
forthwith
determine
to
try
the
experiment
;
though
,
as
they
understand
the
apparition
would
be
produce
to
one
only
at
a
time
,
they
could
not
immediately
agree
in
the
choice
of
the
person
who
should
stand
the
first
brunt
of
the
magician
's
skill
.
    
<EOS>
while
each
of
them
severally
excuse
himself
from
this
preference
on
various
pretence
,
Peregrine
readily
undertake
the
post
,
express
great
confidence
of
the
conjurer
's
incapacity
to
give
him
the
least
cause
of
apprehension
.
    
<EOS>
this
point
be
settle
,
they
detach
one
of
their
number
to
Crabtree
,
in
order
to
bespeak
and
adjust
the
hour
and
term
of
the
operation
,
which
he
insist
upon
perform
at
his
own
apartment
,
where
every
thing
be
prepare
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
time
,
they
go
thither
in
a
body
,
to
the
number
of
seven
,
in
full
expectation
of
detect
the
impostor
;
and
be
receive
with
such
gloomy
formality
,
as
seem
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
countenance
of
some
among
them
;
though
they
be
encourage
by
the
vivacity
of
Pickle
,
who
affect
a
double
share
of
petulance
,
for
the
more
effectual
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
make
no
reply
to
the
interrogation
they
utter
,
in
the
levity
of
their
insolence
,
at
their
first
entrance
,
but
order
Hadgi
to
conduct
them
through
the
next
room
,
that
they
may
see
there
be
no
previous
apparatus
to
affright
their
deputy
with
object
foreign
to
his
undertaking
.
<EOS>
They
find
nothing
but
a
couple
of
wax
-
taper
burn
on
a
table
that
stand
with
a
chair
by
it
,
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
,
and
return
to
the
audience
-
chamber
,
leave
Peregrine
by
himself
,
to
encounter
the
phantom
of
that
person
,
whom
they
should
(
without
his
knowledge
)
desire
the
magician
to
conjure
up
to
his
view
.
    
<EOS>
all
the
door
be
shut
,
and
the
company
seat
,
a
profound
silence
ensue
,
together
with
a
face
of
dreadful
expectation
,
encourage
by
the
blue
flame
of
the
candle
,
which
be
tipt
with
sulphur
for
that
purpose
,
and
heighten
by
the
dismal
sound
of
a
large
bell
,
which
Hadgi
toll
in
the
anti
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
cadwallader
have
thus
practise
upon
their
ignorance
and
fear
,
desire
them
to
name
the
person
to
be
produce
;
and
after
some
whisper
among
themselves
,
one
of
them
take
the
pen
,
and
write
the
name
of
commodore
Trunnion
upon
a
slip
of
paper
,
put
it
into
the
hand
of
the
magician
,
who
rise
from
his
seat
,
and
open
the
door
of
his
closet
,
display
to
their
view
a
scull
,
with
thigh
-
bone
cross
upon
a
table
cover
with
black
cloth
.
    
<EOS>
this
melancholy
spectacle
make
a
remarkable
impression
upon
the
imagination
of
the
company
,
already
prepossess
by
the
previous
ceremony
;
and
they
begin
to
survey
one
another
with
look
of
consternation
,
while
Cadwallader
shut
himself
in
the
closet
,
that
be
contiguous
to
the
chamber
in
which
his
friend
Peregrine
be
station
,
thrust
the
label
with
his
uncle
's
name
through
a
small
chink
in
the
partition
,
accord
to
agreement
,
mutter
all
the
time
a
sort
of
gibberish
,
that
increase
the
pannic
of
his
audience
;
then
return
to
his
chair
,
the
knell
be
knolle
again
,
and
Pickle
call
aloud
,
"
damn
your
mummery
,
why
do
not
you
dispatch
?
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
signal
to
Crabtree
,
who
thus
certify
of
his
have
receive
the
paper
,
stand
up
and
wave
his
wand
in
the
figure
of
an
S.
<EOS>
the
motion
be
thrice
perform
,
their
ear
be
all
of
a
sudden
invade
by
a
terrible
noise
in
the
next
room
,
accompany
with
the
voice
of
Peregrine
,
who
exclaim
in
a
tone
of
horror
and
amazement
,
"
guard
me
,
heaven
!
<EOS>
my
uncle
Trunnion
!
"
    
<EOS>
this
ejaculation
have
such
an
effect
upon
the
hearer
,
that
two
of
them
swoon
with
fear
,
a
third
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
pray
aloud
,
while
the
other
three
,
in
a
transport
of
dismay
and
distraction
,
burst
open
the
door
,
and
rush
into
the
haunted
chamber
,
where
they
find
the
table
and
chair
overturn
,
and
Peregrine
extend
(
in
all
appearance
)
without
sense
or
motion
,
upon
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
They
immediately
begin
to
chase
his
temple
,
and
the
first
symptom
of
his
recovery
,
which
they
perceive
,
be
an
hollow
groan
;
after
which
,
he
pronounce
these
word
:
"
merciful
power
!
<EOS>
if
I
live
,
I
see
the
commodore
with
his
black
patch
,
in
the
very
cloath
he
wear
at
my
sister
's
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
declaration
compleate
their
astonishment
and
terror
;
they
observe
a
wildness
in
his
look
,
which
he
seem
to
bend
on
something
conceal
from
their
view
;
and
be
infect
by
his
appearance
to
such
a
pitch
of
superstition
,
that
it
would
have
be
an
easy
matter
to
persuade
them
,
that
the
chair
and
table
be
apparition
of
their
forefather
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
conduct
Peregrine
into
the
council
chamber
,
where
the
conjurer
and
Hadgi
be
employ
in
ministre
to
those
who
have
faint
:
and
the
patient
have
retrieve
the
use
of
their
faculty
,
Cadwallader
assume
a
double
portion
of
severity
in
his
aspect
,
ask
if
they
be
not
ashamed
of
their
former
incredulity
;
declaring
,
that
he
be
ready
to
give
them
more
convincing
proof
of
his
art
upon
the
spot
,
and
would
immediately
recal
three
generation
of
their
progenitor
from
the
dead
,
if
they
be
dispose
to
relish
such
company
.
<EOS>
then
turn
to
one
of
them
,
whose
great
grandfather
have
be
hang
,

of
your
family
?
<EOS>
say
the
word
;
and
he
shall
appear
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
youth
,
who
have
be
the
most
insolent
and
obstreperous
of
the
whole
society
,
and
be
now
depressed
with
the
same
proportion
of
fear
,
alarm
at
the
proposal
,
assure
the
magician
,
he
have
no
curiosity
of
that
sort
remain
;
and
that
,
what
he
have
already
see
,
would
(
he
hope
)
have
a
good
effect
upon
his
future
life
and
conversation
.
<EOS>
every
one
of
these
hero
make
an
acknowledgment
and
profession
of
the
same
kind
,
some
of
which
be
attend
with
tear
;
and
Hadgi
have
provide
chair
for
the
whole
company
,
they
depart
exceedingly
crest
-
fall
;
and
two
of
the
number
actually
sicken
with
the
agitation
they
have
undergo
,
while
our
hero
and
his
associate
make
themselves
merry
with
the
success
of
their
enterprize
.
    
<EOS>
but
this
scheme
of
fortune
-
telling
do
not
engross
his
whole
attention
;
he
still
continue
to
maintain
his
appearance
in
the
beau
monde
;
and
as
his
expence
far
exceed
his
income
,
strove
to
contract
intimacy
with
people
of
interest
and
power
:
he
shew
himself
regularly
at
court
,
pay
his
respect
to
them
in
all
place
of
public
diversion
,
and
frequently
enter
into
their
party
,
either
of
pleasure
or
card
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
cultivation
,
he
happen
one
evening
,
at
a
certain
chocolate
-
house
,
to
overlook
a
match
at
piquet
,
in
which
he
perceive
a
couple
of
sharper
make
prey
of
a
young
nobleman
,
who
have
neither
temper
nor
skill
sufficient
to
cope
with
such
antagonist
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
a
profess
enemy
to
all
knight
of
industry
,
could
not
bear
to
see
them
cheat
in
publick
with
such
insolent
audacity
;
and
therefore
,
under
pretence
of
communicate
some
business
of
importance
,
he
begg'd
the
favour
of
speak
to
the
young
gentleman
in
another
corner
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
friendly
manner
caution
him
against
the
art
of
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
this
hot
-
head
representative
,
far
from
think
or
own
himself
oblige
to
Pickle
for
his
good
counsel
,
look
upon
the
advice
as
an
insult
upon
his
understanding
;
and
reply
with
an
air
of
ferocious
displeasure
,
that
he
know
how
to
take
care
of
his
own
concern
,
and
would
not
suffer
either
him
or
them
to
bubble
him
out
of
one
shilling
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
offend
at
the
association
,
as
well
as
at
the
ingratitude
and
folly
of
this
conceited
coxcomb
,
express
his
resentment
,
by
tell
him
,
that
he
expect
at
least
an
acknowledgement
for
his
candid
intention
;
but
he
find
his
intellect
too
much
warped
by
his
vanity
,
to
perceive
his
own
want
of
capacity
and
experience
.
<EOS>
inflame
by
this
reproof
,
the
young
nobleman
challenge
him
to
play
for
five
hundred
pound
,
with
many
opprobrious
,
or
at
least
contemptuous
term
of
defiance
,
which
provoke
our
hero
to
accept
the
proposal
;
and
after
the
other
have
disengage
himself
from
the
old
rook
,
who
be
extremely
mortify
at
the
interruption
,
the
two
young
champion
sit
down
,
and
fortune
act
with
uncommon
impartiality
,
Pickle
,
by
the
superiority
of
his
talent
,
in
two
hour
win
to
the
amount
of
as
many
thousand
pound
,
for
which
he
be
oblige
to
take
his
antagonist
's
note
,
the
sharper
have
previously
secure
his
ready
money
.
    
<EOS>
Frantic
with
his
loss
,
the
rash
young
man
would
have
continue
the
game
,
and
double
stake
every
time
;
so
that
Peregrine
may
have
increase
his
acquisition
to
ten
time
the
sum
he
have
gain
;
but
he
think
he
have
already
sufficiently
chastise
the
presumption
of
the
challenger
,
and
be
unwilling
to
impower
fortune
to
ravish
from
him
the
fruit
of
his
success
:
he
therefore
decline
my
lord
's
proposal
,
unless
he
would
play
for
ready
money
;
and
his
lordship
have
in
vain
try
his
credit
among
the
company
,
our
adventurer
withdraw
,
leave
him
in
an
extasy
of
rage
and
disappointment
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
insolence
of
his
behaviour
have
increase
with
his
ill
luck
,
and
he
have
give
vent
to
diver
expression
,
which
Peregrine
take
amiss
,
our
young
gentleman
resolve
to
augment
his
punishment
,
by
teaze
him
with
demand
which
could
not
,
he
know
,
be
immediately
satisfied
;
and
next
day
,
send
Pipes
to
his
father
's
house
with
the
note
,
which
be
draw
payable
upon
demand
.
<EOS>
the
debtor
,
who
have
go
to
bed
half
distract
with
his
misfortune
,
find
himself
wake
with
such
a
disagreeable
dun
,
lose
all
patience
,
curse
Pickle
,
threaten
his
messenger
,
blaspheme
with
horrible
execration
,
and
make
such
a
noise
,
as
reach
the
ear
of
his
father
,
who
order
his
son
to
be
call
into
his
presence
,
examine
him
about
the
cause
of
that
uproar
,
which
have
disturb
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
after
have
essay
to
amuse
him
with
sundry
equivocation
,
which
serve
only
to
increase
his
suspicion
,
and
desire
of
know
the
truth
,
acknowledge
that
he
have
lose
some
money
overnight
at
card
,
to
a
gamester
,
who
have
be
so
impertinent
as
to
send
a
message
,
demand
it
that
morning
,
though
he
have
tell
the
fellow
,
it
would
not
suit
him
to
pay
it
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
the
father
,
who
be
a
man
of
honour
,
reproach
him
with
great
severity
for
his
profligate
behaviour
in
general
,
and
this
scandalous
debt
in
particular
,
which
he
believe
to
be
some
trifle
,
and
give
him
a
bank
note
for
five
hundred
pound
,
command
him
to
go
and
discharge
it
,
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
this
well
-
principle
heir
take
the
money
,
but
instead
of
wait
upon
his
creditor
,
he
forthwith
repair
to
the
gaming
-
house
,
in
hope
of
retrieve
his
loss
;
and
before
he
rise
from
the
table
,
see
his
note
mortgage
for
seven
eighth
of
its
value
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Pickle
,
incense
at
the
treatment
which
his
servant
have
receive
,
and
inform
of
his
lordship
's
second
loss
,
which
aggravate
his
resentment
,
determine
to
preserve
no
medium
;
and
take
out
a
writ
that
same
day
,
put
it
immediately
in
execution
upon
the
body
of
his
debtor
,
just
as
he
stepp'd
into
his
chair
,
at
the
door
of
White
's
Chocolate
-
house
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
be
naturally
fierce
and
haughty
,
attempt
to
draw
upon
the
bailiff
,
who
disarm
him
in
a
twinkling
;
and
this
effort
serve
only
to
heighten
his
disgrace
,
which
be
witness
by
a
thousand
people
,
most
of
whom
laugh
very
heartily
,
at
the
adventure
of
a
lord
's
be
arrest
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
public
transaction
could
not
long
escape
the
knowledge
of
his
father
,
who
(
that
very
day
)
have
the
satisfaction
to
hear
that
his
son
be
in
a
spunging
-
house
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
information
,
he
send
his
steward
to
learn
the
particular
of
the
arrest
,
and
be
equally
offend
,
surprize
,
and
concerned
,
when
he
understand
the
nature
of
the
debt
,
which
he
imagine
his
son
have
already
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
pay
such
a
considerable
sum
for
a
spendthrift
,
whom
he
have
but
too
much
indulge
,
and
who
in
less
than
one
week
may
involve
himself
in
such
another
difficulty
,
the
old
gentleman
write
a
letter
to
Peregrine
,
represent
what
a
hardship
it
would
be
upon
him
to
forfeit
such
sum
by
the
indiscretion
of
a
son
,
whose
engagement
he
be
not
bind
to
fulfil
,
and
desire
some
mitigation
in
his
demand
,
as
it
be
not
a
debt
contract
for
value
receive
,
but
incur
without
subject
him
to
the
least
damage
or
inconvenience
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
no
sooner
receive
this
letter
,
than
he
go
in
person
to
wait
upon
the
author
,
to
whom
he
,
in
a
candid
manner
,
relate
the
particular
circumstance
of
the
match
,
together
with
the
ingratitude
and
audacity
of
his
son
,
which
he
own
have
stimulate
him
to
such
measure
as
he
,
otherwise
,
would
have
scorn
to
take
.
<EOS>
the
nobleman
acknowledge
,
that
the
revenge
be
hardly
adequate
to
the
provocation
,
and
condemn
the
conduct
of
his
son
with
such
justice
and
integrity
,
as
disarm
Peregrine
of
his
resentment
,
and
dispose
him
to
give
an
undoubted
proof
of
his
own
disinterestedness
,
which
he
immediately
exhibit
,
by
produce
the
note
,
and
tear
it
to
piece
,
after
have
assure
his
lordship
,
that
the
writ
should
be
withdraw
,
and
the
prisoner
discharge
before
night
.
    
<EOS>
the
earl
,
who
perfectly
well
understand
the
value
of
money
,
and
be
no
stranger
to
the
character
of
mankind
,
stand
amazed
at
this
sacrifice
which
Pickle
protest
be
offer
by
his
esteem
for
his
lordship
;
and
after
have
compliment
him
upon
his
generosity
,
in
a
very
uncommon
strain
of
encomium
,
begg'd
<EOS>
the
favour
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
insist
upon
his
dining
with
him
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
the
youth
,
proud
of
have
meet
with
such
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
,
in
less
than
an
hour
perform
every
article
of
his
promise
;
and
in
the
morning
be
visit
by
the
debtor
,
who
come
,
by
the
express
order
of
his
father
,
to
thank
him
for
the
obligation
under
which
he
be
lay
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
offence
he
have
give
.
    
<EOS>
this
condescension
be
very
glorious
for
our
hero
,
who
graciously
receive
his
submission
,
and
accompany
him
to
dinner
,
where
he
be
caress
by
the
old
earl
with
mark
of
particular
affection
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
nor
be
his
gratitude
confine
to
exterior
civility
;
he
offer
him
the
use
of
his
interest
at
court
,
which
be
very
powerful
,
and
repeat
his
desire
of
serve
him
so
pressingly
,
that
Peregrine
think
he
could
not
dispense
with
the
opportunity
of
assist
his
absent
friend
Godfrey
,
in
whose
behalf
he
begg'd
the
influence
of
his
lordship
.
    
<EOS>
the
earl
,
pleased
with
this
request
,
which
be
another
proof
of
the
young
gentleman
's
benevolence
,
say
,
he
would
not
fail
to
pay
the
utmost
regard
to
his
recommendation
;
and
in
six
week
a
captain
's
commission
be
actually
sign
for
the
brother
of
Emilia
,
who
be
very
agreeably
surprize
at
the
intimation
he
receive
from
the
war
-
office
,
though
he
be
utterly
ignorant
of
the
canal
through
which
he
obtain
that
promotion
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
XCIII
Peregrine
be
celebrate
as
a
wit
and
patron
,
and
proceed
to
entertain
himself
at
the
expence
of
whom
it
do
concern
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Peregrine
flourish
in
the
gay
scene
of
life
,
and
(
as
I
have
already
observe
)
have
diver
opportunity
of
profit
in
the
way
of
marriage
,
have
not
his
ambition
be
a
little
too
inordinate
,
and
his
heart
still
bias
by
a
passion
,
which
all
the
levity
of
youth
could
not
balance
,
nor
all
the
pride
of
vanity
overcome
.
<EOS>
nor
be
our
hero
unmarke
in
the
world
of
letter
and
taste
:
he
have
signalize
himself
in
several
poetical
production
,
by
which
he
have
acquire
a
good
share
of
reputation
;
not
that
the
piece
be
such
as
ought
to
have
do
much
honour
to
his
genius
;
but
any
tolerable
performance
from
a
person
of
his
figure
and
suppose
fortune
,
will
always
be
consider
,
by
the
bulk
of
reader
,
as
an
instance
of
astonishing
capacity
;
though
the
very
same
production
,
usher
into
the
world
with
the
name
of
an
author
in
less
affluent
circumstance
,
would
be
justly
disregard
and
despise
;
so
much
be
the
opinion
of
most
people
influence
and
over
-
awe
by
ridiculous
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
our
young
gentleman
be
no
sooner
distinguish
as
an
author
,
than
he
be
mark
out
as
a
patron
,
by
all
the
starve
retainer
to
poetry
:
he
be
solemnize
in
ode
,
celebrate
in
epigram
,
and
feed
with
the
milk
of
soft
dedication
.
<EOS>
His
vanity
even
relish
this
incense
;
and
though
his
reason
could
not
help
despise
those
that
offer
it
,
not
one
of
them
be
send
away
,
unowne
by
his
munificence
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
himself
,
in
good
earnest
,
that
superior
genius
which
their
flattery
have
describe
;
he
cultivate
acquaintance
with
the
wit
of
fashion
,
and
even
compose
in
secret
a
number
of
bon
mot
,
which
he
utter
in
company
as
the
impromptu
's
of
his
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
practice
indeed
,
he
imitate
some
of
the
most
renowned
genius
of
the
age
,
who
(
if
the
truth
be
know
)
have
labour
in
secret
,
with
the
sweat
of
their
brow
,
for
many
a
repartee
which
they
have
vend
as
the
immediate
production
of
fancy
and
expression
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
successful
in
this
exercise
of
his
talent
,
that
his
fame
actually
come
in
competition
with
that
of
a
great
man
,
who
have
long
sit
at
the
helm
of
wit
;
and
in
a
dialogue
that
once
happen
between
them
,
on
the
subject
of
a
cork
-
screw
,
wherein
the
altercation
be
discharge
(
accord
to
Bayes
)
slap
for
slap
,
dash
for
dash
,
our
hero
be
judge
to
have
the
well
of
his
lordship
,
by
some
of
the
minor
satellite
,
that
commonly
surround
and
reflect
the
ray
of
such
mighty
luminary
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
dip
himself
so
far
in
these
literary
amusement
,
that
he
take
the
management
of
the
pit
into
his
direction
,
put
himself
at
the
head
of
those
critic
who
call
themselves
the
town
;
and
in
that
capacity
chastise
several
player
,
who
have
be
render
insolent
and
refractory
by
unmerited
success
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
new
production
of
the
stage
,
though
generally
unspirited
and
insipid
,
they
always
enjoy
the
benefit
of
his
influence
and
protection
;
because
he
never
dislike
the
performance
so
much
as
he
sympathize
with
the
poor
author
,
who
stand
behind
the
scene
in
the
most
dreadful
suspence
,
tremble
,
as
it
be
,
on
the
very
brink
of
damnation
:
<EOS>
yet
,
though
he
extend
his
generosity
and
compassion
to
the
humble
and
needy
,
he
never
let
slip
one
opportunity
of
mortify
villainy
and
arrogance
.
<EOS>
have
the
executive
power
of
the
legislature
be
vest
in
him
,
he
would
have
doubtless
devise
strange
specie
of
punishment
for
all
offender
against
humanity
and
decorum
;
but
,
restrict
as
he
be
,
he
employ
his
invention
in
subject
them
to
the
ridicule
and
contempt
of
their
fellow
-
subject
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
with
that
view
he
set
on
foot
the
scheme
of
conjuration
,
<EOS>
which
be
still
happily
carry

this
advantage
to
the
purpose
of
gallantry
,
be
(
as
the
reader
may
have
perceive
)
of
a
very
amorous
complexion
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
act
the
reformer
,
or
rather
the
castigator
,
in
the
fashionable
world
,
but
also
exercise
his
talent
among
the
inferior
class
of
people
,
who
chance
to
incur
his
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>

one
day

by
a
couple
of
chairman

who
demand
more
than

he
take
particular
notice
of
their
number

and
next
day

in
one
of
his
old
suit

go
by
his
direction
to
a
coffee

house
near
their
stand
,
after
he
have
load
himself
with
an
additional
weight
,
amount
to
an
hundred
pound
at
least
;
and
call
the
same
individual
partner
who
have
affront
his
master
<EOS>
,
he
take
possession
of
their
chair
,
and
order
them
to
carry
him
to
a
place
at
the
distance
of
two
long
mile
.
<EOS>
the
burthen
be
so
extraordinary
,
that
when
they
attempt
to
take
him
up
,
they
imagine
the
vehicle
be
detain
by
some
crack
or
crevice
of
the
pavement
,
and
one
of
them
actually
go
to
disengage
it
;
but
find
it
clear
,
he
begin
a
song
of
imprecation
upon
his
fare
,
who
he
swear
have
get
a
backside
of
block
-
tin
;
but
,
be
oblige

accomplish
his
undertaking
,
he
bend
his
shoulder
once
more
to
the
load
,
bid
his
comrade
lift
fair
and
be
damn'd
.
    
<EOS>
the
task
be
not
perform
in
silence
;
while
they
stagger
along
,
he
curse
in
a
strain
peculiar
to
himself
,
and
in
vain
endeavour
to
provoke
the
patient
pipe
with
opprobrious
language
,
hope
that
he
would
either
dismiss
them
from
his
service
,
or
be
so
incensed
at
his
abuse
,
as
to
proceed
to
manual
chastisement
;
in
which
case
,
the
fellow
would
have
an
opportunity
of
gratify
his
choler
upon
the
author
of
his
present
grievance
.
<EOS>
finding
,
however
,
that
the
gentleman
bear
his
reproach
with
the
most
philosophic
indifference
,
he
lose
all
patience
;
and
be
restrain
,
by
the
fear
of
the
law
,
from
an
assault
upon
his
fare
,
he
turn
the
stream
of
his
indignation
upon
his
own
partner
,
who
,
he

,
do
not

his
share
of
the
burthen

which

with
such
virulence
of
obloquy
,
as

<EOS>
the

be
accordingly
set
down

without
ceremony

themselves
in
a
moment

the

Sir

one
may
easily
distinguish
an
upright

or
rather
groan

sneak'd
off

without

he
who
seem
to
be
the
most
afflict
of

take
his
departure
,
with
an
exclamation
of
"
humbugged

"
    
<EOS>
such
be
the
amusement
of
our
hero
,
tho
'
<EOS>
they
do
not
engross
his
whole

some
part
of
which
be
dedicate
to
nocturnal
riot
and
revel
,
among
a
set
of
young
nobleman
,
who
have
denounce
war
against
temperance
,
oeconomy
,
and
common
sense
,
and
be
indeed
the
devoted
son
of
tumult
,
waste
,
and
prodigality
.
    
<EOS>
not
that
Peregrine
relish
those
scene
,
which
be
a
succession
of
absurd
extravagance
,
devoid
of
all
true
spirit
,
taste
,
or
enjoyment
:
but
his
vanity
prompt
him
to
mingle
with
those
who
be
intitle
the
choice
spirit
of
the
age
;
and
his
disposition
be
so
pliable
,
as
to
adapt
itself
easily
to
the
measure
of
his
company
,
where
he
have
not
influence
enough
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
director
.
<EOS>
the
rendezvous
be
at
a
certain
tavern
,
which
may
be
properly
stile
the
temple
of
excess
,
where
they
leave
the
choice
of
their
fare
to
the
discretion
of
the
landlord
,
that
they
may
save
themselves
the
pain
of
exercise
their
own
reason
;
and
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
adjust
the
bill
,
order
the
waiter
to
declare
how
much
every
individual
must
pay
,
without
specify
the
article
of
the
charge
;
and
this
proportion
generally
amount
to
two
guinea
per
head
for
each
dinner
and
supper
,
and
frequently
exceed
that
sum
;
of
which
the
landlord
durst
not
abate
,
without
run
the
risque
of
have
his
nose
slit
for
his
moderation
.
    
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
puny
expence
,
compare
with
that
which
they
often
incur
,
by
the
damage
do
to
the
furniture
and
servant
,
in
the
madness
of
their
intoxication
,
as
well
as
the
loss
they
sustain
at
hazard
,
an
amusement
to
which
all
of
them
have
recourse
,
in
the
progress
of
their
debauch
.
<EOS>
this
elegant
diversion
be
introduce
,
encourage
,
and
promote
by
a
crew
of
rapacious
sharper
,
who
have
make
themselves
necessary
companion
to
this
hopeful
generation
,
by
the
talent
of
pimping
and
buffoonery
:
and
though
they
be
universally
know
,
even
by
those
they
prey
upon
,
to
have
no
other
mean
of
earn
their
livelihood
,
than
the
most
infamous
and
fraudulent
practice

they
be
caress
and
court
by
these
infatuate
dupe

when

who

detest
those

be
a

enemy
to
the
whole
society
of
gamester

whom
he
consider
,
and
always

as
the
foe
of

licentious

imperceptibly
into

by
those
cormorant

who
be
no

dangerous
in
the
art
of
cheating
,
than
by
their
consummate
skill
in
work
upon

of
unwary

<EOS>
They
be
,
for
the
most
part

naturally
cool

phlegmatic
and
crafty
,
and
by
a
long
habit
of
dissimulation
,
have
gain
an
absolute
dominion
over
the

so
that

over

invite

and
defy
on

forget
all
his
maxim
of
caution

sobriety
,
and
plunge
into
the
reign
folly
of

place

have
frequent
occasion
to
moralize
in
the
morning
,
upon
the
loss

few

of

enjoy
life
with
great

notwithstanding
those
intervene
check
of

,
which
serve
only
to
whet
his
appetite
for
a
repetition
of

when
he
receive
the
following
letter
,
by
which
he
be
determined
to
visit
his
estate
in
the
country
.
    
<EOS>
Cousin
Pickle
,
I
hope
you
be
in
a
better
trim
than
your
aunt
,
who
hath
be
fast
moor
to
her
bed
these
seven
week
,
by
several
foot
of
under
-
water
logging
in
her
hold
and
hollop
,
<EOS>
whereby
I
doubt
her
plank
be
rot
,
so
as
she
can
not
chuse
but
fall
to
piece
in
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
all
in
my
power
to
keep
her
tight
and
easy
,
and
free
from
sudden
squall
that
may
overstrain
her
.
<EOS>
and
here
have
be
the
doctor
,
who
have
skuttle
her
low
deck
,
and
let
out
six
gallon
water
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
wonder
how
the
devil
it
come
there
;
for
you
know
as
how
it
be
a
liquor
she
never
take
in
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
those
fellow
the
doctor
,
they
be
like
unskilful
carpenter
,
that
in
mend
one
leak
,
make
a
couple
;
and
so
she
fill
again
apace
.
<EOS>
but
the
bad
sign
of
all
be
this
here
,
she
will
not
let
a
drop
of
Nantz
go
betwixt
<EOS>
the
combing
of
her
tooth
,
and
have
quite
lose
the
rudder
of
her
understanding
,
whereby
she
yaw
woundily
in
her
speech
,
palaver
about
some
foreign
part
call
the
New
Geereusalem
,
and
wish
herself
in
a
safe
birth
in
the
river
Geordun
.
<EOS>
the
parson
,
I
must
say
,
strive
to
keep
her
steady
,
concern
the
navigation
of
her
soul
,
and
talk
very
sensibly
of
charity
and
the
poor
,
whereof
<EOS>
she
hath
leave
a
legacy
of
two
hundred
pound
in
her
will
.
<EOS>
and
here
have
be
Mr
Gamaliel
and
your
brother
my
lord
,
demand
entrance
at
the
gate
,
in
order
to
see
her
;
but
I
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
aboard
,
and
point
my
patereroe
,
which
make
them
sheer
off
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
Mrs
Clover
keep
close
watch
upon
her
kinswoman
,
without
ever
turn
in
,
and
a
kind
-
hearted
young
woman
it
be
.
    
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
see
you
at
the
garison
,
if
the
wind
of
your
inclination
sit
that
way
;
and
mayhap
it
may
be
a
comfort
to
your
aunt
,
to
behold
you
along
-
side
of
her
,
when
her
anchor
be
speak
.
<EOS>
so
no
more
at
present
,
but
rest
 
Your
friend
and
humble
servant
to
command
,
Jno
Hatchway
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
after
the
receipt
of
this
epistle
,
Peregrine
,
in
order
to
manifest
his
regard
to
his
aunt
,
as
well
as
his
friendship
for
honest
Jack
,
set
out
on
horseback
for
their
habitation
,
attend
by
Pipes
,
who
long
to
see
his
old
messmate
;
but
,
before
he
reach
the
garison
,
Mrs
Hatchway
have
give
up
the
ghost
,
in
the
threescore
and
fifth
year
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
the
widower
seem
to
bear
his
loss
with
resignation
,
and
behave
very
decently
upon
the
occasion
,
though
he
do
not
undergo
those
dangerous
transport
of
sorrow
,
which
some
tender
-
hearted
husband
have
feel
at
the
departure
of
their
yoke
-
fellow
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
be
naturally
a
philosopher
,
and
so
well
disposed
to
acquiesce
in
the
dispensation
of
providence
,
that
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
every
other
emergency
of
his
life
,
he
firmly
believe
,
that
every
thing
which
happen
be
for
the
good
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
task
,
therefore
,
be
not
so
great
in
comfort
him
,
as
in
console
his
own
sister
,
who
with
great
poignancy
and
sincerity
of
grief
,
lament
the
death
of
the
only
relation
with
whom
she
have
maintain
any
intimacy
of
correspondence
;
for
her
mother
be
as
implacable
as
ever
,
in
her
enmity
against
her
and
Peregrine
,
and
rather
more
determined
in
her
rancour
,
that
which
be
originally
a
sudden
transport
of
indignation
,
be
by
this
time
settle
into
a
confirm
inveteracy
of
hate
.
<EOS>
as
for
Gam
,
who
be
now
dignify
by
the
country
-
people
with
the
appellation
of
the
young
squire
,
he
still
act
in
the
capacity
of
minister
to
the
caprice
and
vengeance
of
his
mother
,
take
all
opportunity
of
disturb
Julia
's
peace
,
slander
her
reputation
,
and
commit
outrage
against
the
tenant
and
domestic
of
her
husband
,
who
be
a
man
of
a
quiet
and
timorous
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
but
the
chief
amusement
of
young
Pickle
,
in
his
later
year
,
be
the
chace
,
in
which
he
acquire
some
renown
by
his
intrepidity
and
remarkable
figure
,
which
improve
every
day
in
deformity
;
insomuch
,
as
to
suggest
a
ludicrous
scheme
of
revenge
to
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
have
be
affront
by
the
insolence
of
Crookback
,
cloathe
a
large
baboon
that
be
in
his
possession
,
in
a
dress
that
resemble
the
hunting
-
equipage
of
Gam
;
and
order
the
animal
to
be
set
astride
,
and
tie
upon
the
back
of
his
keen
hunter
,
turn
them
out
one
day
after
the
hound
;
and
the
horse
in
a
little
time
outstrip
all
the
rest
in
the
field
,
the
rider
be
mistake
for
Gam
by
the
whole
company
,
who
salute
him
as
he
pass
with
a
hollow
,
observe
,
that
the
squire
have
his
usual
good
luck
,
in
be
better
mount
than
his
neighbour
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
afterwards
appear
in
his
own
person
,
create
great
astonishment
in
the
spectator
,
one
of
whom
ask
if
he
have
split
himself
in
twain
,
and
point
out
his
representative
,
who
be
by
this
time
almost
up
with
the
hound
:
upon
which
,
the
identical
Gam
go
in
pursuit
of
the
impostor
;
and
when
he
overtake
him
be
so
much
enrage
at
the
counterfeit
,
that
he
attack
the
baboon
whip
in
hand
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
sacrifice
him
to
his
resentment
,
have
not
he
be
prevent
by
the
other
foxhunter
,
who
interpose
,
in
order
to
make
up
the
difference
betwixt
two
brother
of
the
sport
,
and
be
equally
surprised
and
divert
,
when
they
distinguish
the
quality
of
crookback
's
antagonist
,
which
they
rescue
from
his
rage
,
and
reconveye
to
its
master
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
at
the
request
of
his
friend
Jack
,
take
charge
of
his
aunt
's
funeral
,
to
which
his
parent
be
invite
,
though
they
do
not
think
proper
to
appear
,
or
pay
the
least
regard
to
his
sollicitation
,
when
he
desire
permission
to
wait
upon
them
in
person
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
old
Gamaliel
,
at
the
instigation
of
his
wife
,
afterwards
obtain
an
order
from
Doctor
's
Commons
,
oblige
Hatchway
to
produce
the
will
of
his
wife
,
on
the
supposition
that
she
have
bequeath
to
him
some
part
of
the
money
which
(
she
know
)
be
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
but
from
this
step
he
reap
no
other
satisfaction
than
that
of
find
himself
altogether
neglect
by
the
testatrix
,
who
have
leave
all
her
effect
to
her
husband
,
except
one
thousand
pound
,
with
her
jewel
,
to
Julia
's
daughter
,
the
benefaction
mention
in
the
lieutenant
's
letter
,
and
some
inconsiderable
legacy
to
her
favourite
domestick
.
    
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
the
interment
of
this
good
lady
,
our
hero
be
agreeably
surprised
with
a
visit
from
his
friend
Godfrey
,
who
have
come
to
England
in
consequence
of
that
promotion
which
he
owe
to
his
interest
,
tho
'
the
soldier
himself
place
it
to
the
credit
of
a
certain
courtier
who
have
formerly
promise
to
befriend
him
,
and
now
find
his
advancement
unowne
,
very
modestly
arrogate
the
merit
of
it
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
communicate
his
good
fortune
to
Pickle
,
who
compliment
him
upon
it
as
an
event
of
which
he
have
no
precognition
;
and
at
the
same
time
tell
him
,
that
,
in
consequence
of
his
preferment
,
his
cousin
at
Windsor
have
consent
to
his
be
immediately
unite
in
the
band
of
wedlock
with
his
lovely
Sophy
;
that
the
wedding
-
day
be
already
fix
;
and
that
nothing
would
be
want
to
his
happiness
,
if
Peregrine
would
honour
the
nuptial
with
his
presence
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
accept
the
invitation
with
great
eagerness
,
when
he
learn
that
Emilia
would
be
there
in
quality
of
bride
's
maid
;
and
now
repeat
what
he
have
formerly
write
to
his
friend
,
namely
,
that
he
be
not
only
willing
,
but
extremely
impatient
to
attone
for
his
mad
behaviour
to
that
young
lady
,
by
lay
himself
and
his
whole
fortune
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
thank
him
for
his
honourable
intention
,
and
promise
to
use
his
influence
,
and
that
of
Sophy
,
in
his
behalf
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
seem
dubious
of
their
success
,
on
account
of
his
sister
's
delicacy
,
which
could
not
pardon
the
least
shadow
of
disrespect
.
<EOS>
He
own
,
indeed
,
he
be
not
certain
that
she
would
appear
in
the
same
company
with
Pickle
;
but
as
she
have
make
no
stipulation
on
that
score
,
he
would
interpret
her
silence
in
the
most
favourable
manner
,
and
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
his
design
,
until
she
should
find
it
too
late
to
retract
with
any
decency
.
    
<EOS>
the
hope
of
see
and
converse
with
Emilia
,
and
perhaps
of
be
reconcile
to
her
,
after
have
suffer
so
much
and
so
long
from
her
displeasure
,
raise
a
tumult
of
idea
in
his
breast
,
and
produce
a
strange
inquietude
of
joy
and
perturbation
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
have
stay
with
him
a
few
day
,
and
signify
the
time
appoint
for
his
spousal
,
take
his
leave
,
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
occasion
;
while
Peregrine

with
his

Hatchway
,
make
a
tour
among
his
acquaintance
in
the
country
,
with
a
view
of
sound
their
inclination
touch
a
project
which
he
have
lately
conceive

of
offer
himself
as
a

at

scheme
,
which
be
suggest
to
him
by
one
of
his
quality
patron
,
would
have
succeed
accord
to
his
wish
,
have
the
election
take
place
immediately
;
but
before
that
happen
,
his
interest
be
overbalance
by
some
small
accident
that
will
be
record
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
he
repair
to
Windsor
on
the
eve
of
his
friend
's
marriage
,
and
understand
from
Godfrey
,
that
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
he
and
Sophy
could
prevail
upon
his
sister
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
,
when
she
be
inform
that
her
lover
be
invite
,
and
that
her
consent
have
not
be
obtain
until
they
have
promise
,
on
the
part
of
Peregrine
,
that
he
should
not
renew
the
old
topic
,
nor
even
speak
to
her
in
the
stile
of
a
former
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
be
nettle
at
this
preliminary
,
to
which
,
however
,
he
say
he
would
adhere
;
and
so
well
do
he
think
himself
fortify
with
pride
and
resentment
,
that
he
resolve
to
behave
towards
her
with
such
indifference
,
as
would
,
he
hope
,
mortify
her
vanity
,
and
thereby
punish
her
for
the
implacability
of
her
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
Armed
with
these
sentiment
,
he
be
next
day
introduce
by
Godfrey
to
the
bride
,
who
receive
him
with
her
usual
sweetness
of
temper
and
affability
;
and
Emilia
be
present
,
he
salute
her
with
a
distant
bow
,
which
she
acknowledge
with
a
cold
curt'sy
,
and
an
aspect
of
ice
.
<EOS>
tho
'
this
deportment
confirm
his
displeasure
,
her
beauty
undermine
his
resolution
;
he
think
her
charm
be
infinitely
improve
since
their
last
parting
,
and
a
thousand
fond
image
recur
to
his
imagination
,
he
feel
his
whole
soul
dissolve
into
tenderness
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
in
order
to
banish
those
dangerous
idea
,
he
endeavour
to
enter
into
a
gay
conversation
with
Sophy
,
on
the
subject
of
the
approach
ceremony
;
but
his
tongue
perform
its
office
very
aukwardly
,
his
eye
be
attract
towards
Emilia
,
as
if
they
have
be
subject
to
the
power
of
fascination
;
in
spite
of
all
his
effort
,
a
deep
sigh
escape
from
his
bosom
,
and
his
whole
appearance
indicate
anxiety
and
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
perceive
his
condition
,
abridge
the
visit
,
and
have
conduct
his
companion
to
his
own
lodging
,
express
his
concern
at
have
be
the
innocent
occasion
of
his
uneasiness
,
by
expose
him
to
the
sight
of
Emilia
,
which
he
perceive
have
give
him
pain
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
have
by
this
time
recollect
the
dictate
of
his
pride
,
assure
him
,
that
he
be
very
much
mistake
in
the
cause
of
his
disorder
,
which
be
no
other
than
a
sudden
qualm
,
to
which
he
have
be
for
some
time
subject
;
and
to
shew
him
how
philosophically
he
could
bear
the
disdain
of
Emilia
,
which
,
with
all
deference
to
her
conduct
,
he
could
not
help
think
a
little
too
severe
,
he
desire
,
as
the
bridegroom
have
make
preparation
for
a
private
ball
in
the
evening
,
that
he
would
provide
him
with
an
agreeable
partner
;
in
which
case
he
would
exhibit
undoubted
proof
of
the
tranquillity
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
hope
(
answer
Godfrey
)
of
be
able
,
with
the
assistance
of
Sophy
,
to
make
up
matter
between
you
and
my
sister
,
and
for
that
reason
keep
her
unengage
to
any
other
gentleman
for
the
night
;
but
since
she
be
so
peevishly
obstinate
,
I
shall
take
care
to
accommodate
you
with
a
very
handsome
young
lady
,
whose
partner
will
not
be
sorry
to
exchange
her
for
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
the
thought
of
have
an
opportunity
to
coquet
with
another
woman
,
under
the
eye
of
this
implacable
mistress
,
support
his
spirit
during
the
ceremony
which
put
Gauntlet
in
possession
of
his
heart
's
desire
;
and
,
by
mean
of
this
cordial
,
he
find
himself
so
undisturbed
at
dinner
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
sit
opposite
to
his
fair
enemy
,
that
he
be
able
to
pass
some
occasional
joke
upon
the
new
-
married
couple
,
with
some
appearance
of
mirth
and
good
humour
.
<EOS>
nor
do
emily
any
otherwise
seem
affect
by
his
presence
,
than
by
except
him
from
the
participation
of
those
genial
regard
which
she
distribute
to
the
rest
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
this
easiness
of
behaviour
on
her
side
,
reinforce
his
resolution
,
by
give
him
pretence
to
call
her
sensibility
in
question
;
for
he
could
not
conceive
how
any
woman
of
acute
feeling
could
sit
unmoved
,
in
presence
of
a
man
with
whom
she
have
such
recent
and
intimate
connexion
:
not
consider
,
that
she
have
much
more
reason
to
condemn
his
affectation
of
unconcern
,
and
that
her
external
deportment
may
,
like
his
own
,
be
an
effort
of
pride
and
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
this
contest
,
in
point
of
dissimulation
,
continue
till
night
,
when
the
company
be
pair
for
dancing
,
and
Peregrine
begin
the
ball
by
walk
a
minuet
with
the
bride
;
then
he
take
out
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
be
recommend
by
Gauntlet
,
be
very
well
pleased
to
see
that
her
person
be
such
as
may
have
inspire
even
emily
herself
with
jealousy
,
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
perceive
his
mistress
couple
with
a
gay
young
officer
,
whom
(
with
all
due
deference
to
his
own
qualification
)
he
consider
as
no
despicable
rival
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
himself
first
begin
hostility
,
by
become
all
of
a
sudden
particular
with
his
partner
,
whom
he
forthwith
assail
with
flattering
compliment
,
that
soon
introduce
the
subject
of
love
,
upon
which
he
expatiate
with
great
art
and
elocution
,
use
not
only
the
faculty
of
speech
,
but
also
the
language
of
the
eye
,
in
which
he
be
a
perfect
connoisseur
.
    
<EOS>
this
behaviour
soon
manifest
itself
to
the
whole
assembly
,
the
great
part
of
whom
believe
that
he
be
in
good
earnest
captivate
by
the
heart
of
his
partner
,
<EOS>
while
Emilia
,
penetrate
into
his
design
,
turn
his
own
artillery
upon
himself
,
by
seem
to
listen
with
pleasure
to
the
address
of
his
rival
,
who
be
no
novice
in
the
art
of
make
love
:
she
even
affect
uncommon
vivacity
,
and
giggle
aloud
at
every
whisper
which
he
convey
into
her
ear
,
insomuch
that
she
,
in
her
turn
,
afford
speculation
to
the
company
,
who
imagine
the
young
soldier
have
make
a
conquest
of
the
bridegroom
's
sister
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
himself
begin
to
cherish
the
same
opinion
,
which
gradually
invade
his
good
humour
,
and
,
at
length
,
fill
his
bosom
with
rage
.
    
<EOS>
He
strove
to
suppress
his
indignation
,
and
call
every
consideration
of
vanity
and
revenge
to
his
aid
<EOS>
:
he
endeavour
to
wean
his
eye
from
the
fatal
object
that
disturb
him
,
but
they
would
not
obey
his
direction
and
command
;
he
wish
himself
deprive
of
all
sensation
,
when
he
hear
her
laugh
,
and
see
her
smile
upon
the
officer
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
country
-
dancing
,
when
he
be
oblige
to
join
hand
with
her
,
the
touch
thrill'd
thro
'
all
his
nerve
,
and
kindle
a
flame
within
him
which
he
could
not
contain
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
his
endeavour
to
conceal
the
situation
of
his
thought
,
be
so
violent
,
that
his
constitution
could
not
endure
the
shock
;
the
sweat
run
down
his
forehead
in
a
stream
,
the
colour
vanish
from
his
cheek
,
his
knee
begin
to
totter
,
and
his
eyesight
to
fail
:
so
that
he
must
have
fall
at
his
full
length
upon
the
floor
,
have
not
he
retire
very
abruptly
into
another
room
,
where
he
throw
himself
upon
a
couch
,
and
faint
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
condition
he
be
find
by
his
friend
,
who
see
him
withdraw
with
such
symptom
of
disorder
,
follow
him
thith
;
and
when
he
recover
the
use
of
his
faculty
,
press
him
to
make
use
of
a
bed
in
that
house
,
rather
than
expose
himself
to
the
night
air
,
by
go
home
to
his
own
lodging
:
but
not
be
able
to
prevail
upon
him
to
accept
the
offer
,
he
wrap
him
up
in
a
cloak
,
and
conduct
him
to
the
inn
where
he
lodge
,
help
him
to
undress
and
go
to
bed
,
where
he
be
immediately
seize
with
a
violent
fit
of
the
ague
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
behave
with
great
tenderness
,
and
would
have
actually
bear
him
company
all
night
,
notwithstanding
the
circumstance
of
his
own
situation
,
have
not
his
friend
insist
upon
his
return
to
the
company
,
and
make
his
apology
to
his
partner
for
his
sudden
departure
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
step
absolutely
necessary
towards
maintain
the
quiet
of
the
assembly
,
which
he
find
in
great
consternation
,
occasion
by
his
absence
;
for
some
of
the
lady
see
the
bridegroom
follow
the
stranger
in
his
retreat
,
the
meaning
of
which
they
do
not
comprehend
,
begin
to
be
afraid
of
a
quarrel
;
and
Emilia
,
upon
pretence
of
that
supposition
,
be
so
much
alarm
,
that
she
could
not
stand
,
and
be
fain
to
have
recourse
to
a
smell
bottle
.
    
<EOS>
the
bride
,
who
understand
the
whole
mystery
,
be
the
only
person
that
act
with
deliberation
and
composure
;
she
impute
Emilia
's
disorder
to
the
right
cause
,
which
be
no
other
than
concern
for
the
condition
of
her
lover
,
and
assure
the
lady
there
be
nothing
extraordinary
in
Mr
Pickle
's
go
off
,
he
be
subject
to
fainting
fit
,
by
which
he
be
often
overtake
without
any
previous
notice
.
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
Gauntlet
confirm
the
truth
of
this
declaration
;
he
make
an
apology
to
the
company
,
in
the
name
of
his
friend
,
who
,
he
tell
them
,
be
suddenly
take
ill
;
and
they
return
to
their
diversion
of
dancing
,
with
this
variation
:
Emilia
be
so
disorder
and
fatigue
,
that
she
beg
to
be
excuse
from
continue
the
exercise
;
and
Peregrine
's
partner
be
disengage
,
be
pair
with
the
young
officer
for
whom
she
be
originally
design
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
bride
withdraw
into
another
apartment
,
with
her
sister
,
and
expostulate
with
her
upon
her
cruelty
to
Mr
Pickle
,
assure
her
,
from
Godfrey
's
information
,
that
he
have
undergo
a
severe
fit
on
her
account
,
which
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
have
a
dangerous
effect
upon
his
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
Emily
be
inflexible
in
her
answer
to
the
kind
remonstrance
of
the
gentle
Sophy
,
her
heart
be
melt
with
the
impression
of
pity
and
love
;
and
find
herself
unable
to
perform
the
duty
of
her
function
,
in
put
the
bride
to
bed
,
she
retire
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
,
in
secret
,
sympathize
with
the
distemper
of
her
lover
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
as
early
as
decency
would
permit
him
to
leave
the
arm
of
his
dear
wife
,
captain
Gauntlet
make
a
visit
to
Peregrine
,
who
have
pass
a
very
tedious
and
uneasy
night
,
have
be
subject
to
short
interval
of
delirium
,
during
which
Pipes
have
find
it
very
difficult
to
keep
him
fast
belay
.
<EOS>
He
own
indeed
to
Godfrey
,
that
his
imagination
have
be
haunt
by
the
idea
of
Emilia
and
her
officer
,
which
torment
him
to
an
unspeakable
degree
of
anguish
and
distraction
;
and
that
he
would
rather
suffer
death
than
a
repetition
of
such
excruciating
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
comfort
by
his
friend
,
who
assure
him
,
that
his
sister
's
inclination
would
,
in
time
,
prevail
over
all
the
endeavour
of
resentment
and
pride
,
illustrate
this
asseveration
by
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
she
be
affect
by
the
knowledge
of
his
disorder
,
and
advise
him
to
implore
the
mediation
of
Sophy
,
in
a
letter
which
she
should
communicate
to
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
an
opportunity
which
our
hero
think
too
favourable
to
be
neglect
;
and
therefore
call
for
paper
,
he
sit
up
in
his
bed
,
and
,
in
the
first
transport
of
his
emotion
,
write
the
follow
petition
to
Godfrey
's
amiable
wife
.
    
<EOS>
Dear
madam
,
the
affliction
of
a
contrite
heart
can
never
appeal
to
your
benevolence
in
vain
;
and
therefore
I
presume
to
approach
you
,
in
this
season
of
delight
,
with
the
language
of
sorrow
,
request
that
you
will
espouse
the
cause
of
an
unhappy
lover
,
who
mourn
with
unutterable
anguish
over
his
ruined
hope
,
and
interceed
for
my
pardon
with
that
divine
creature
,
whom
,
in
the
intemperance
and
excess
of
passion
,
I
have
so
mortally
offend
.
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
be
my
guilt
inexpiable
?
<EOS>
be
I
exclude
from
all
hope
of
remission
?
<EOS>
be
I
devoted
to
misery
and
despair
?
<EOS>
I
have
offer
all
the
atonement
which
the
most
perfect
and
sincere
penitence
could
suggest
,
and
she
reject
my
humility
and
repentance
.
<EOS>
if
her
resentment
would
pursue
me
to
the
grave
,
let
her
signify
her
pleasure
;
and
may
I
be
brand
with
the
name
of
villain
,
and
remember
with
infamy
and
detestation
to
all
posterity
,
if
I
hesitate
one
moment
in
sacrifice
a
life
which
be
odious
to
Emilia
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
madam
,
while
I
thus
pour
forth
the
effusion
of
my
grief
and
distraction
,
I
look
around
the
apartment
in
which
I
lie
,
and
every
well
-
know
object
that
salute
my
view
,
recal
to
my
remembrance
<EOS>
that
fond
,
that
happy
day
,
on
which
the
fair
,
the
good
,
the
tender
hearte
Sophy
become
my
advocate
,
though
I
be
a
stranger
to
her
acquaintance
,
and
effect
a
transport
reconciliation
between
me
and
that
same
inchanting
beauty
,
that
be
now
so
implacably
incensed
.
    
<EOS>
if
she
be
not
satisfied
with
the
pang
of
remorse
and
disappointment
,
the
transport
of
madness
I
have
undergo
;
let
her
prescribe
<EOS>
what
farth
penance
<EOS>
she
think
I
ought
to
endure
;
and
when
I
decline
her
sentence
,
let
me
be
the
object
of
her
eternal
disdain
.
      
<EOS>
I
commit
myself
,
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
dear
Sophy
!
<EOS>
dear
partner
of
my
friend
!
<EOS>
to
your
kind
interposition
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
manage
my
cause
,
as
a
concern
on
which
my
happiness
intirely
depend
;
and
I
hope
every
thing
from
your
compassion
and
benefience
,
while
I
fear
every
thing
from
her
rigour
and
barbarity
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
call
it
barbarity
,
a
savageness
of
delicacy
altogether
inconsistent
with
the
tenderness
of
human
nature
;
and
may
the
most
abject
contempt
be
my
portion
,
if
I
live
under
its
infliction

<EOS>
but
I
begin
to
rave
.
<EOS>
I
conjure
you
by
your
own
humanity
and
sweetness
of
disposition
,
I
conjure
you
by
your
love
for
the
man
whom
heaven
hath
decree
your
protector
,
to
employ
your
influence
with
that
angel
of
wrath

in
behalf
of
 
Your
obliged
and
obedient
servant

P
Pickle

<EOS>
this
epistle
be
immediately
transmit
by
Godfrey
to
his
wife
,
who
peruse
it
with
mark
of
the
most
humane
sympathy
;
and
carry
it
into
her
sister
's
chamber
,
"
<EOS>
here
be
something
(
say
she
,
present
the
paper
)
which
I
must
recommend
to
your
serious
attention
.
"
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
who
immediately
guess
the
meaning
of
this
address
,
absolutely
refuse
to
look
upon
it
,
or
even
to
hear
it
read
,
till
her
brother
enter
the
apartment
,
reprimand
her
sharply
for
her
obstinacy
and
pride
,
accuse
her
of
folly
and
dissimulation
,
and
enter
so
warmly
into
the
interest
of
his
friend
,
that
she
think
him
unkind
in
his
remonstrance
,
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
reproach
him
with
partiality
and
want
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
who
entertain
the
most
perfect
love
and
veneration
for
his
sister
,
ask
pardon
for
have
give
offence
,
and
kiss
the
drop
from
her
fair
eye
,
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
,
for
his
sake
,
listen
to
the
declaration
of
his
friend
.
    
<EOS>
thus
sollicite
,
she
could
not
refuse
to
hear
the
letter
,
which
when
he
have
repeat
,
she
lament
her
own
fate
,
in
be
the
occasion
of
so
much
uneasiness
<EOS>
,
desire
her
brother
to
assure
Mr
Pickle
,
that
she
be
not
a
voluntary
enemy
to
his
peace
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
wish
him
all
happiness
,
tho
'
<EOS>
she
hope
he
would
not
blame
her
for
consult
her
own
,
in
avoid
any
future
explanation
or
connexion
with
a
person
whose
correspondence
she
find
herself
under
a
necessity
to
renounce
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
the
new
-
married
couple
exhaust
their
eloquence
in
attempt
to
prove
,
that
the
reparation
which
our
hero
have
offer
be
adequate
to
the
injury
she
have
sustain
;
that
in
reconcile
herself
to
a
penitent
lover
,
who
subscribe
to
her
own
term
of
submission
,
her
honour
would
be
acquit
by
the
most
scrupulous
and
severe
judge
of
decorum
;
and
that
her
inflexibility
would
be
justly
ascribe
to
the
pride
and
insensibility
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
their
argument
,
exhortation
and
intreatie
,
and
threaten
to
leave
the
house
immediately
,
if
they
would
not
promise
to
drop
that
subject
of
discourse
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
very
much
chagrin
at
the
bad
success
of
his
endeavour
,
return
to
his
friend
,
and
make
as
favourable
a
report
of
the
affair
,
as
the
nature
of
his
conversation
with
Emilia
would
permit
;
but
as
he
could
not
avoid
mention
her
resolution
in
the
close
,
Peregrine
be
oblige
to
drink
again
the
bitter
draught
of
disappointment
,
which
put
his
passion
into
such
a
state
of
agitation
,
as
produce
a
short
extasy
of
despair
,
in
which
he
act
a
thousand
extravagancy
.
<EOS>
this
paroxysm
,
however
,
soon
subside
into
a
settle
reserve
of
gloomy
resentment
,
which
he
in
secret
indulged
,
detach
himself
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
company
of
the
soldier
,
on
pretence
of
retire
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
lie
ruminate
upon
the
circumstance
of
his
present
situation
,
his
friend
Pipes
,
who
know
the
cause
of
his
anxiety
,
and
firmly
believe
that
Emilia
love
his
master
in
her
heart
,
howsoever
she
may
attempt
to
disguise
her
sentiment
;
I
say
,
Thomas
be
take
with
a
conceit
which
he
think
would
set
every
thing
to
right
,
and
therefore
put
it
in
execution
,
without
farther
delay
.
<EOS>
lay
aside
his
hat
,
he
run
directly
to
the
house
of
Sophy
's
father
,
and
affect
an
air
of
surprize
and
consternation
,
to
which
he
have
never
before
be
subject
,
thunder
at
the
door
with
such
an
alarming
knock
,
as
in
a
moment
bring
the
whole
family
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
admit
,
he
begin
to
gape
,
stare
,
and
pant
at
the
same
time
,
and
make
no
reply
,
when
Godfrey
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
till
Mrs
Gauntlet
express
her
apprehension
about
his
master
;
at
whose
name
be
mention
,
he
seem
to
make
an
effort
to
speak
,
and
in
a
bellowing
tone
pronounce
"
bring
himself
up
,
split
my
top
-
sail
!
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
point
to
his
own
neck
,
and
rise
upon
his
tiptoe
,
by
way
of
explain
the
meaning
of
his
word
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
without
stay
to
ask
another
question
,
rush
out
,
and
fly
towards
the
inn
,
with
the
utmost
horror
and
concern
;
while
Sophy
,
who
do
not
rightly
understand
the
language
of
the
messenger
,
address
herself
to
him
a
second
time
,
say
with
great
earnestness
,
"
I
hope
no
accident
have
happen
to
Mr
Pickle
!
"
<EOS>
"
no
accident
at
all
,
(
reply
Tom
)
<EOS>
he
have
only
hang
himself
for
love
.
<EOS>
"
these
word
have
scarce
proceed
from
his
mouth
,
when
Emilia
,
who
stand
listen
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
shriek
aloud
,
and
drop
down
senseless
upon
the
floor
;
while
her
sister
,
who
be
almost
equally
shocked
at
the
intelligence
,
have
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
her
maid
,
by
whom
she
be
support
from
fall
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
hear
Emily
's
voice
,
congratulate
himself
upon
the
success
of
his
stratagem
,
he
spring
to
her
assistance
,
and
lift
her
up
into
an
easy
chair
,
stand
by
her
,
until
he
see
her
recover
from
her
swoon
,
and
hear
her
call
upon
his
master
's
name
,
with
all
the
frenzy
of
despair
love
.
<EOS>
then
he
bend
his
course
back
to
the
inn
,
overjoy
at
the
opportunity
of
tell
Peregrine
what
a
confession
he
have
extort
from
his
mistress
,
and
extremely
vain
of
this
proof
of
his
own
sagacity
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Godfrey
arrive
at
the
house
,
in
which
he
suppose
this
fatal
catastrophe
have
happen
,
run
up
stair
to
Peregrine
's
chamber
,
without
stay
to
make
any
inquiry
below
;
and
find
the
door
lock
,
burst
it
open
with
one
stroke
of
his
foot
.
<EOS>
but
,
what
be
his
amazement
,
when
,
upon
entrance
,
our
hero
start
up
from
the
bed
,
salute
him
with
a
boisterous
exclamation
of
"
Z####ds
!
who
be
there
?
"
    
<EOS>
He
be
strike
dumb
with
astonishment
,
which
also
rivette
him
to
the
place
where
he
stand
,
scarce
credit
the
testimony
of
his
own
sense
,
'
till
Peregrine
,
with
an
air
of
discontent
which
denote
him
displeased
with
his
intrusion
,
dispel
his
apprehension
by
a
second
address
,
say
,
"
I
see
you
consider
me
as
a
friend
,
by
your
use
me
without
ceremony
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
soldier
,
thus
convince
of
the
falsehood
of
the
information
he
have
receive
,
begin
to
imagine
,
that
Pickle
have
project
the
plan
which
be
execute
by
his
servant
;
and
look
upon
it
as
a
piece
of
unjustifiable
finesse
,
which
may
be
attend
with
very
melancholy
consequence
to
his
sister
or
wife
,
he
answer
in
a
supercilious
tone
,
that
he
must
blame
himself
for
the
interruption
of
his
repose
,
which
be
intirely
owing
to
the
sorry
jest
he
have
set
on
foot
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
be
the
child
of
passion
,
and
more
than
half
mad
with
impatience
before
this
visit
,
hear
himself
treat
in
such
a
cavalier
manner
,
advance
close
up
to
Godfrey
's
breast
,
and
assume
a
stern
,
or
rather
frantic
countenance
,
"
Heark
ye
,
Sir
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
be
mistaken
<EOS>
if
you
think
I
jest
;
I
be
in
downright
earnest
<EOS>
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
be
not
a
man
to
be
brow
beat
,
see
himself
thus
beard
by
a
person
of
whose
conduct
he
have
<EOS>
,
he
think
,
reason
to
complain
,
put
on
his
military
look
of
defiance
,
and
erect
his
chest
,
reply
with
an
exalted
voice
,
"
Mr
Pickle
,
whether
you
be
in
jest
or
earnest
,
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
that
the
scheme
be
childish

unseasonable

and
unkind

not
to
give
it
an
harsh
term

"
    
<EOS>
"
Death
,
Sir
,
(
cry
our
adventurer
)
<EOS>
you
trifle
with
my
disquiet
:
if
there
be
any
meaning
in
your
insinuation
,
explain
yourself
,
and
then
I
shall
know
what
answer
it
will
befit
me
to
give

"
<EOS>
"
I
come
with
very
different
sentiment
,
(
resume
the
soldier
)
but
since
you
urge
me
to
expostulation
,
and
behave
with
such
unprovoked
loftiness
of
displeasure
,
I
will
,
without
circumlocution
,
tax
you
with
have
commit
an
outrage
upon
the
peace
of
my

in
send
your
fellow

us
with
such
an
abrupt
account
of
your

violence
upon
yourself

"
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
confound
at
this
imputation
,
stand
silent
,
with
a
most
savage
aspect
of
surprize
,
eager
to
know
the
circumstance
to
which
his
accuser
allude
,
and
incense
to
find
it
without
the
sphere
of
his
comprehension
.
    
<EOS>
while
these
two
irritated
friend
stand
front
each
other
with
mutual
indignation
in
their
eye
and
attitude
,
they
be
join
by
Pipes
,
who
without
take
the
least
notice
of
the
situation
in
which
he
find
them
,
tell
his
master
,
that
he
may
up
with
the
top
-
gallant
-
mast
of
his
heart
,
and
out
with
his
rejoice
pendant
;
for
as
to
mistress
Emily
,
he
have
clapt
her
helm
a
-
weather
,
the
vessel
wear
,
and
now
she
be
upon
the
other
tack
,
stand
right
into
the
harbour
of
his
good
will
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
be
not
yet
a
connoisseur
in
the
term
of
his
lacquey
,
command
him
,
upon
pain
of
his
displeasure
,
to
be
more
explicit
in
his
intelligence
;
and
by
dint
of
diver
question
,
obtain
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
scheme
which
he
have
put
in
execution
for
his
service
.
    
<EOS>
this
information
perplex
him
not
a
little
;
he
would
have
chastise
his
servant
upon
the
spot
,
for
his
temerity
,
have
not
he
plainly
perceive
,
that
the
fellow
's
intention
be
to
promote
his
ease
and
satisfaction
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
he
know
not
how
to
acquit
himself
of
the
suspicion
which
he
see
Godfrey
entertain
of
his
be
the
projector
of
the
plan
,
without
condescend
to
an
explanation
,
which
his
present
disposition
could
not
brook
.
<EOS>
after
some
pause
,
however
,
turn
to
Pipes
,
with
a
severe
frown
,
"
rascal
!
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
this
be
the
second
time
I
have
suffer
in
the
opinion

by
all
that

I
will
put
you
to
death
without

<EOS>
away
,

let
my
horse
be
saddle
this
instant
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pipes
have
withdraw
,
in
order
to
perform
this
piece
of
duty
,
our
young
gentleman
,
address
himself
again
to
the
soldier
,
and
lay
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
say
with
a
solemnity
of
regard
,
"
Captain
Gauntlet
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
be
altogether
innocent
of
that
shallow
device
which
you
impute
to
my
invention
;
and
I
do
not
think
you
do
justice
either
to
my
intellect
or
honour
,
in
suppose
me
capable
of
such
insolent
absurdity
.
<EOS>
as
for
your
sister
,
I
have
once
in
my
life
affront
her
in
the
madness
and
impetuosity
of
desire
;
but
I
have
make
such
acknowledgement
,
and
offer
such
atonement
,
as
few
woman
of
her
sphere
would
have
refuse
;
and
before
God
!
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
endure
every
torment
of
disappointment
and
despair
,
rather
than
prostrate
myself
again
to
the
cruelty
of
her
unjustifiable
pride
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
stalk
suddenly
down
stair
,
and
take
horse
immediately
,
his
spirit
be
support
by
resentment
,
which
prompt
him
to
vow
within
himself
,
that
he
would
seek
consolation
for
the
disdain
of
Emilia
,
in
the
possession
of
the
first
willing
wench
he
should
meet
upon
the
road
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
set
out
for
the
garison
with
these
sentiment
,
Gauntlet
,
in
a
suspence
between
anger
,
shame
and
concern
,
return
to
the
house
of
his
father
-
in

law
,
where
he
find
his
sister
still
violently
agitate
from
the
news
of
Peregrine
's
death
,
the
mystery
of
which
he
forthwith
unravelled
,
recount
at
the
same
time
the
particular
of
the
conversation
which
have
happen
at
the
inn
,
and
describe
the
demeanour
of
Pickle
with
some
expression
of
asperity
,
which
be
neither
agreeable
to
Emilia
,
nor
approve
by
the
gentle
Sophy

who
tenderly
chid
him
,
for
allow
Peregrine
to
depart
in
term
of
misunderstanding

Chapter
XCV
Peregrine
set
out
for
the
garison
,
and
meet
with
a
nymph
of
the
road
,
whom
he
take
into
keeping
,
and
metamorphosis
into
a
fine
lady
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
our
hero
jog
along
in
a
profound
reverie
,
which
be
disturb
by
a
beggar
-
woman
and
her
daughter
,
who
solicit
him
for
alm
,
as
he
pass
them
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
about
the
age
of
sixteen
,
and
notwithstanding
the
wretched
equipage
in
which
she
appear
,
exhibit
to
his
view
a
set
of
agreeable
feature
,
enliven
with
the
complexion
of
health
and
chearfulness
.
<EOS>
the
resolution
I
have
already
mention
be
still
warm
in
his
imagination
;
and
he
look
upon
this
young
mendicant
as
a
very
proper
object
for
the
performance
of
his
vow
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
enter
into
a
conference
with
the
mother
,
and
for
a
small
sum
of
money
purchase
her
property
in
the
wench
,
who
do
not
require
much
courtship
and
intreaty
,
before
she
consent
to
accompany
him
to
any
place
that
he
should
appoint
for
her
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
this
contract
be
settle
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
order
Pipes
to
seat
his
acquisition
behind
him
upon
the
crupper
,
and
alight
at
the
first
public
house
which
they
find
upon
the
road
,
he
write
a
letter
to
Hatchway
,
desire
him
to
receive
this
hedge
-
inamorata
,
and
direct
her
to
be
clean
and
cloathe
in
a
decent
manner
,
with

that

should

touchable
upon

(
on
that
account

defer
for
the
space
of
one
day
.
<EOS>
this
billet
,
together
with
the
girl
,
he
commit
to
the
charge
of
Pipes
,
after
have
lay
strong
injunction
upon
him
to
abstain
from
all
attempt
upon
her
chastity
,
and
order
him
to
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
the
garison
,
while
he
himself
cross
the
country
to
a
market
-
town
,
where
he
propose
to
spend
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
thus
caution
,
proceed
with
his
charge
,
and
be
naturally
taciturn
,
open
not
his
lip
,
until
he
have
perform
the
good
half
of
his
journey
.
<EOS>
but
Thomas
,
notwithstanding
his
irony
appearance
,
be
in
reality
compose
of
flesh
and

and
his
desire
be
titillate
by
the
contact
of
a
buxome
wench
,
whose
right
arm
embrace
his
middle
as
he
ride
,
his
thought
begin
to
mutiny
against
his
master

and
he
find
it
almost
impossible
to
withstand
the
temptation
of
make
love

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
wrestle
with
these
rebellious
suggestion
with
all
the
reason

God

enable
him
to
exert

that
be
totally

<EOS>
such
a
torrent
of
disgraceful
epithet
from
a
person
who
have
no
cloath
at
all
,
convert
the
gallant
's
love
into
choler
,
and
he
threaten
to
dismount
and
seize
her
to
a
tree
,
when
she
should
have
a
taste
of
his
cat

she
set
him
at
defiance

hold
forth
with
such
a
flow
of
eloquence
,
as
would
have
intitle
her
to
a
considerable

of
reputation

even
among

for
this
young

over

have
her
talent
cultivate
among
the
venerable
society
of
weeder
,
podder
,
and
hopper
,
with
whom
she
have
associate
from
her
tender
year

<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
she
soon
obtain
a
compleat
victory
over
Pipes
,
who
(
as
the
reader
may
have
observe
)
be
very
little
addict
to
the
exercise
of
speech
:
indeed
he
be
utterly
disconcert
by
her
volubility
of
tongue
;
and
be
altogether
unfurnished
with
answer
to
the
distinct
period
of
her
discourse
,
very
wisely
choose
to
save
himself
the
expence
of
breath
and
argument
,
by
give
her
a
full
swing
of
cable
,
so
that
she
may
bring
herself
up
;
while
he
ride
onwards
,
in
silent
composure
,
without
take
any
farth
notice
of
his
fair
fellow

traveller
than
if
she
have
be
his
master

cloak

bag

<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
the
dispatch
he
could
make
,
it
be
late
before
he
arrive
at
the
garison
,
where
he
deliver
the
letter
and
the
lady
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
no
sooner
understand
the
intention
of
his
friend
,
than
he
order
all
the
tub
in
the
house
to
be
carry
into
the
hall
,
and
fill
with
water
;
and
Tom
have
provide
himself
with
swab
and
brush
,
divest
the
fair
stranger
of
her
variegate
drapery
,
which
be
immediately
commit
to
the
flame
,
and
perform
upon
her
soft
and
sleek
person
the
ceremony
of
scrubbing
,
as
it
be
practise
on
board
of
the
king
's
ship
of
war
.
<EOS>
yet
the
nymph
herself
do
not
submit
to
this
purification
without
repine
:
<EOS>
she
curs'd
<EOS>
the
director
,
who
be
upon
the
spot
,
with
many
abusive
allusion
to
his
wooden
leg
:
<EOS>
and
as
for
Pipes
the
operator
,
she
employ
her
talon
so
effectually
upon
his
face
,
that
the
blood
run
over
his
nose
in
sundry
stream
;
and
next
morning
,
when
those
rivulet
be
dry
,
his
countenance
resemble
the
rough
bark
of
a
plumb
-
tree
,
plaster
with
gum
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
do
his
duty
with
great
perseverance
,
cut
off
her
hair
close
to
the
scalp
,
handle
his
brush
with
dexterity
,
apply
his
swab
of
different
magnitude
and
texture
,
as
the
case
require
,
and
lastly
,
rinse
her
whole
body
with
a
dozen
pail
of
cold
water
,
discharge
upon
her
head
.
    
<EOS>
these
ablution
be
execute
,
he
dry
her
with
towel
,
accommodate
her
with
a
clean
shift
,
and
act
the
part
of
a
valet
de
chambre
,
cloathe
her
from
head
to
foot
,
in
clean
and
decent
apparel
which
have
belong
to
Mrs
Hatchway
;
by
which
mean
her
appearance
be
alter
so
much
for
the
well
,
that
when
Peregrine
arrive
next
day
,
he
would
scarce
believe
his
own
eye
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
for
that
reason
,
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
purchase
,
and
now
resolve
to
indulge
a
whim
which
seize
him
at
the
very
instant
of
his
arrival
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
(
as
I
believe
the
reader
will
readily
allow
)
make
considerable
progress
in
the
study
of
character
,
from
the
high
rank
to
the
most
humble
station
of
life
,
and
find
it
diversify
in
the
same
manner
,
thro
'
every
degree
of
subordination
and
precedency
:
nay
<EOS>
,
he
moreover
observe
,
that
the
conversation
of
those
who
be
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
polite
company
,
be
neither
more
edifying
nor
entertaining
than
that
which
be
meet
with
among
the
low
class
of
mankind
;
and
that
the
only
essential
difference
in
point
of
demeanor
,
be
the
form
of
an
education
,
which
the
mean
capacity
can
acquire
,
without
much
study
or
application
.
<EOS>
possess
of
this
notion
,
he
determine
to
take
the
young
mendicant
under
his
own
tutorage
and
instruction
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
which
he
hope
he
should
,
in
a
few
week
,
be
able
to
produce
her
in
company
,
as
an
accomplished
young
lady
of
uncommon
wit
,
and
an
excellent
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
this
extravagant
plan
he
forthwith
begin
to
execute
with
great
eagerness
and
industry
;
and
his
endeavour
succeed
even
beyond
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
the
obstacle
,
in
surmount
of
which
he
find
the
great
difficulty
,
be
an
inveterate
habit
of
swearing
,
which
have
be
indulge
from
her
infancy
,
and
confirm
by
the
example
of
those
among
whom
she
have
live
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
the
rudiment
of
good
sense
from
nature
,
which
teach
her
to
listen
to
wholesome
advice
,
and
be
so
docile
as
to
comprehend
and
retain
the
lesson
which
her
governor
recommend
to
her
attention
;
insomuch
,
that
he
venture
,
in
a
few
day
,
to
present
her
at
table
,
among
a
set
of
country
squire
,
to
whom
she
be
introduce
as
a
niece
of
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
in
that
capacity
she
sit
with
become
easiness
of
mien
(
for
she
be
as
void
of
the
mauvaise
honte
as
any
dutchess
in
the
land
)
bow
very
graciously
to
the
compliment
of
the
gentleman
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
she
say
little
or
nothing
,
because
she
be
previously
caution
on
that
score
,
she
more
than
once
give
way
to
laughter
,
and
her
mirth
happen
to
be
pretty
well
time
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
attract
the
applause
and
admiration
of
the
guest
,
who
,
after
she
be
withdraw
,
compliment
Mr
Hatchway
upon
the
beauty
,
breeding
and
good
humour
of
his
kinswoman
.
    
<EOS>
but
what
contribute
more
than
any
other
circumstance
to
her
speedy
improvement
,
be
some
small
insight
into
the
primer
,
which
she
have
acquire
at
a
day
-
school
,
during
the
life
of
her
father
,
who
be
a
day
-
labourer
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
upon
this
foundation
do
Peregrine
build
a
most
elegant
superstructure
;
he
cull
out
choice
sentence
from
Shakespear
,
Otway
,
and
Pope
,
and
teach
her
to
repeat
them
with
emphasis
and
theatrical
cadence
:
he
then
instruct
her
in
the
name
and
epithet
of
the
most
celebrated
player
,
which
he
direct
her
to
pronounce
occasionally
,
with
an
air
of
careless
familiarity
;
and
perceive
that
her
voice
be
naturally
clear
,
he
enrich
it
with
remnant
of
opera
tune
,
to
be
hum
during
a
pause
in
conversation
,
which
be
generally
supply
with
the
circulation
of
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
cultivation
,
she
become
a
wonderful
proficient
in
the
polite
grace
of
the
age
;
she
,
with
great
facility
,
comprehend
the
scheme
of
whist
,
tho
'
cribbidge
be
her
favourite
game
,
with
which
she
have
amuse
herself
in
her
vacant
hour
,
from
her
first
entrance
into
the
profession
of
hopping
;
and
brag
soon
grow
familiar
to
her
practice
and
conception
.
    
<EOS>
thus
prepare
,
she
be
expose
to
the
company
of
her
own
sex
,
be
first
of
all
visit
by
the
parson
's
daughter
,
who
could
not
avoid
shew
that
civility
to
Mr
Hatchway
's
niece
,
after
she
have
make
her
public
appearance
at
church
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Clover
,
who
have
a
great
share
of
penetration
,
could
not
help
entertain
some
doubt
about
this
same
relation
,
whose
name
she
have
never
hear
the
uncle
mention
,
during
the
whole
term
of
her
residence
at
the
garison
;
but
as
the
young
lady
be
treat
in
that
character
,
she
would
not
refuse
her
acquaintance
,
and
after
have
see
her
at
the
castle
,
actually
invite
Miss
Hatchway
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
make
a
progress
thro
'
almost
all
the
family
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
,
by
dint
of
her
quotation
,
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
not
always
judiciously
use
)
<EOS>
she
pass
for
a
sprightly
young
lady
,
of
uncommon
learning
and
taste
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
have
,
in
this
manner
,
initiate
her
in
the
beau
monde
of
the
country
,
conduct
her
to
London
,
where
she
be
provide
with
private
lodging
and
a
female
attendant
;
and
put
her
immediately
under
the
tuition
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
have
order
to
instruct
her
in
dancing
and
the
french
language
.
<EOS>
He
attend
her
to
play
and
concert
,
three
or
four
time
a
week
;
and
when
our
hero
think
her
sufficiently
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
great
company
,
he
squire
her
in
person
to
a
public
assembly
,
and
dance
with
her
among
all
the
gay
lady
of
fashion
:
not
but
that
there
be
still
an
evident
air
of
rusticity
and
aukwardness
in
her
demeanor
,
which
be
interpret
into
an
agreeable
wildness
of
spirit
,
superior
to
the
form
of
common
breeding
.
    
<EOS>
He
afterwards
find
mean
to
make
her
acquaint
with
some
distinguished
pattern
of
her
own
sex
,
by
whom
she
be
admit
into
their
most
elegant
party
,
and
continue
to
make
good
her
pretension
to
gentility
,
with
great
circumspection
,
till
one
evening
,
be
at
card
with
a
certain
lady
,
whom
she
detect
in
the
very
fact
of
unfair
conveyance
,
she
tax
her
roundly
with
the
fraud
,
and
bring
upon
herself
such
a
torrent
of
sarcastic
reproof
,
as
overbore
all
her
maxim
of
caution
,
and
burst
open
the
floodgate
of
her
own
natural
repartee
,
twang
off
with
the
appellation
of
b
#
#
#
#
and
w
#
#
#
#
,
which
she
repeat
with
great
vehemence
,
in
an
attitude
of
manual
defiance
,
to
the
terror
of
her
antagonist
,
and
the
astonishment
of
all
present
:
<EOS>
nay
,
to
such
an
unguarded
pitch
be
she
provoke
,
that
start
up
,
she
snapt
her
finger
,
in
testimony
of
disdain
,
and
,
as
she
quit
the
room
,
apply
her
hand
to
that
part
which
be
the
last
of
her
that
disappear
,
invite
the
company
to
kiss
it
,
by
one
of
its
coarsest
denomination
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
a
little
disconcert
at
this
oversight
in
her
behaviour
,
which
,
by
the
daemon
of
intelligence
,
be
in
a
moment
<EOS>
convey
to
all
the
private
company
in
town
;
so
that
she
be
absolutely
exclude
from
all
polite
communication
,
and
Peregrine
,
for
the
present
,
disgrace
among
the
modest
part
of
his
female
acquaintance
,
many
of
whom
not
only
forbad
him
their
house
,
on
account
of
the
impudent
insult
he
have
commit
upon
their
honour
as
well
as
understanding
,
in
palm
a
common
trull
upon
them
,
as
a
young
lady
of
birth
and
education
,
but
also
asperse
his
family
,
by
affirm
that
she
be
actually
his
own
counsin

german
,
whom
he
have
precipitately
raise
from
the
most
abject
state
of
humility
and

with
the

the

Mean

for
this

of

promise
faithfully

keep
a

with
great
assiduity
to

who
gradually

<EOS>
in
other

who

,
but
intirely
to
the
irresistible
charm
of
the
young
lady
,
to
whom
he
be
now
so
happy
as
to
be
join
in
the
silken
bond
of
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
tho
'
at
first
offend
at
his
valet
's
presumption
,
be
,
upon
second
thought
,
reconcile
to
the
event
by
which
he
be
deliver
from
an
incumbrance
;
for
by
this
time
he
have
perform
his
frolick
,
and
begin
to
be
tired
of
his
acquisition
.
    
<EOS>
He
reflect
on
the
former
fidelity
of
the
Swiss
,
which
have
be
manifest
in
a
long
course
of
service
and
attachment
;
and
think
it
would
be
cruelly
severe
to
abandon
him
to
poverty
and
distress
for
one
venial
trespass
,
he
resolve
to
pardon
what
he
have
do
,
and
enable
him
in
some
shape
to
provide
for
the
family
which
he
have
intaile
upon
himself
.
    
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
,
he
send
a
favourable
answer
to
the
delinquent
,
desire
to
see
him
as
soon
as
his
passion
would
permit
him
to
leave
the
arm
of
his
spouse
,
for
an
hour
or
two
;
and
Hadgi
,
in
obedience
to
this
intimation
,
repair
immediately
to
the
lodging
of
his
master
,
before
whom
he
appear
with
a
most
penitential
aspect
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
could
scarce
help
laugh
at
his
rueful
length
of
face
,
reprimand
him
sharply
for
his
disrespect
and
ingratitude
,
in
take
that
by
stealth
which
he
may
have
have
for
ask
;
and
the
culprit
assure
him
,
that
next
to
the
vengeance
of
God
,
his
displeasure
be
that
which
,
of
all
evil
,
he
dread
to
incur
;
but
that
love
have
distract
his
brain
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
banish
every
other
consideration
but
<EOS>
that
of
gratify
his
desire
;
and
he
own
,
that
he
should
not
have
be
able
to
preserve
his
fidelity
and
duty
to
his
own
father
,
have
they
interfere
with
the
interest
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
then
appeal
to
his
master
's
own
heart
for
the
remission
of
his
guilt
,
allude
to
certain
circumstance
of
our
hero
's
conduct
,
which
evince
the
desperate
effect
of
love
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
make
such
an
apology
as
extort
a
smile
from
his
offend
judge
,
who
not
only
forgive
his
transgression
,
but
also
promise
to
put
him
in
some
fair
way
of
earn
a
comfortable
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
the
Swiss
be
so
much
affect
with
this
instance
of
generosity
,
that
he
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
kiss
his
hand
,
pray
to
heaven
,
with
great
fervour
,
to
make
him
worthy
of
such
goodness
and
condescension
.
<EOS>
His
scheme
,
he
say
,
be
to
open
a
coffeehouse
and
tavern
in
some
creditable
part
of
the
town
,
in
hope
of
be
favour
with
the
custom
of
a
numerous
acquaintance
he
have
make
among
upper

reputable
tradesman
,
not
doubt
that
his
wife
would
be
an
ornament
to
his
bar
,
and
a
careful
manager
of
his
affair
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
approve
of
the
plan
,
towards
the
execution
of
which
he
make
him
and
his
wife
a
present
of
five
hundred
pound

together
with
a
promise
of
erect
a
weekly
club
among
his
friend
,
for
the
reputation
and
advantage
of
the
house

<EOS>
Hadgi
be
so
transported
with

good
fortune

that
he
run
to

who
be
in

He

Pallet
;
contract
an
intimacy
with
a
new

market
nobleman
;
and
be
by
the
know

one
take

<EOS>
this
affair
be
settle
,
and
our
adventurer
,
for
the
present
,
free
of
all
female
connexion
,
he
return
to
his
former
course
of
fast
living
,
among
the
buck
of
the
town
,
and
perform
innumerable
exploit
among
whore
,
bully
,
rook
,
constable
,
and
justice
of
the
peace
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
occupation
,
he
be
one
morning
visit
by
his
old
fellow
-
traveller
Pallet
,
whose
appearance
give
him
equal
surprize
and
concern
.
<EOS>
tho
'
the
weather
be
severe
,
he
be
cloathe
in
the
thin
summer
-
dress
which
he
have
wear
at
Paris
,
and
be
now
not
only
threadbare
,
but
in
some
part
actually
patch
;
his
stocking
,
by
a
repetition
of
that
practice
know
among
oeconomist
by
the
term
of
coax
,
hang
like
pudding
-
bag
about
his
ankle
;
his
shirt
,
tho
'
new
-
wash'd
,
be
of
the
saffron
hue
,
and
in
diver
place
appear
through
the
cranny
of
his
breech
;
he
have
exchange
his
own
hair
for
a
smoke
-
dry'd
tye
-
periwig
,
which
all
the
flour
in
his
drudging
-
box
have
not
be
able
to
whiten
;
his
eye
be
sink
,
his
jaw
lengthen
beyond
their
usual
extension
;
and
he
seem
twenty
year
old
than
he
look
when
he
and
our
hero
part
at
Rotterdam
.
    
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
these
evidence
of
decay
,
he
accost
him
with
a
meagre
affectation
of
content
and
good
humour
,
struggle
piteously
to
appear
gay
and
unconcerned
,
profess
his
joy
at
see
him
in
England
,
excuse
himself
for
have
delay
so
long
to
come
and
present
his
respect
;
alledge
,
that
since
his
return
he
have
be
a
meer
slave
to
the
satisfaction
of
some
person
of
quality
and
taste
,
who
have
insist
upon
his
finish
some
piece
with
the
utmost
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
receive
him
with
that
compassion
and
complaisance
which
be
natural
to
his
disposition
,
inquire
about
the
health
of
Mrs
Pallet
and
his
family
,
and
ask
if
his
friend
the
doctor
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
the
painter
seem
to
have
resume
his
resentment
against
that
gentleman
,
of
whom
he
speak
in
contemptuous
term
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
(
say
he
)
be
so
much
overshadow
with
presumption
and
self
-
conceit
,
that
his
merit
have
no
relief
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
rise
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
keeping
in
the
picture
,
my
dear
Sir
.
<EOS>
all
the
same
as
if
I
be
to
represent
the
moon
under
a
cloud
;
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
deep
mass
of
shade
,
with
a
little
tiny
speck
of
light
in
the
middle
,
which
would
only
serve
to
make
,
as
it
be
,
the
darkness
visible
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
.
<EOS>
have
he
take
my
advice
,
it
may
have
be
well
for
him
;
but
he
be
bigotte
to
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Mr
Pickle
,
upon
our
return
to
England
,
I
counsel
him
to
compose
a
little
,
smart
,
clever
ode
upon
my
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
as
Gad
shall
judge
me
,
I
think
it
would
have
be
of
some
service
,
in
help
him
out
of
obscurity
;
for
you
know
,
as
Sir
Richard
observe
,
soon
will
that
die
,
which
add
thy
fame
to
mine
.
<EOS>
let
me
then
live
,
join'd
to
a
work
of
thine
.
    
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
there
be
a
most
picturesque
contrast
in
these
line
,
of
thy
and
me
,
live
and
die
,
and
thine
and
mine
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
a
pize
upon
it
!
<EOS>
Dick
,
after
all
,
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
ecod
!
<EOS>
he
round
it
off
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
return
to
this
unhappy
young
man
,
would
you
believe
it
,
he
toss
up
his
nose
at
my
friendly
proposal
,
and
gabble
something
in
Greek
,
which
be
not
worth
repeat
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
this
,
my
dear
Sir
,
he
be
out
of
humour
at
the
neglect
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
He
think
the
poet
of
the
age
be
jealous
of
his
genius
,
and
strove
to
crush
it
accordingly
,
while
the
rest
of
mankind
want
taste
sufficient
to
discern
it
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
profes
myself
one
of
these
;
and
as
the
clown
in
Billy
Shakespear
say
of
the
courtier
's
oath
,
have
I
swear
by
the
doctor
's
genius
,
that
the
pancake
be
naught
<EOS>
,
they
may
have
be
for
all
that
very
good
,
yet
should
not
I
have
be
forswear
.
<EOS>
let
that
be
as
it
will
,
he
retire
from
town
in
great
dudgeon
,
and
set
up
his
rest
near
a
hill
in
Derbyshire
,
with
two
top
,
resemble
Parnassus
,
and
a
well
at
the
bottom
,
which
he
have
christen
Hyp
-
o
-
the
-
Green
.
<EOS>
egad
!
<EOS>
if
he
stay
in
that
habitation
,
'
tis
my
opinion
<EOS>
he
will
soon
grow
green
with
the
hip
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
return
to
the
flesh
-
pot
of
Egypt
,
and
pay
his
court
to
the
slight
queen
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
well
remember
,
by
this
light
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
,
my
good
Sir
,
that
this
same
egyptian
princess
have
be
court
by
so
many
gallant
of
taste
,
that
as
I
hope
to
live
,
I
find
myself
in
some
sort
of
a
dilemma
,
because
in
part
with
her
to
one
,
I
should
have
disoblige
all
his
rival
.
<EOS>
now
a
man
would
not
chuse
to
give
offence
to
his
friend
,
at
least
I
lie
it
down
as
a
maxim
,
to
avoid
the
small
appearance
of
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
every
man
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
propose
to
all
the
candidate
,
that
a
lottery
or
raffle
should
be
set
on
foot
,
by
which
every
individual
would
have
an
equal
chance
for
her
good
grace
,
and
the
prize
to
be
leave
to
the
decision
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
scheme
be
mightily
relish
,
and
the
term
be
such
a
trifle
as
half
a
guinea
,
the
whole
town
croude
into
my
house
,
in
order
to
subscribe
.
    
<EOS>
but
there
I
be
their
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
gentleman
,
you
must
have
a
little
patience
till
my
own
particular
friend
be
serve
.
<EOS>
among
that
number
,
I
do
myself
the
honour
to
consider
Mr
Pickle
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
copy
of
the
proposal
;
and
if
the
list
should
be
adorn
with
his
name
,
I
hope
,
notwithstanding
his
merit
success
among
the
young
lady
<EOS>
,
he
will
for
once
be
shun
by
that
little
vixen
call
Miss
Fortune
;
he
,
he
,
he
!
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
bow
with
a
thousand
apish
cong
,
and
present
his
paper
to
Peregrine
,
who
see
the
number
of
subscriber
be
limit
to
one
hundred
,
say
he
think
him
too
moderate
in
his
expectation
,
as
he
do
not
doubt
that
his
picture
would
be
a
cheap
purchase
at
five
hundred
,
instead
of
fifty
pound
,
at
which
the
price
be
fix
.
<EOS>
to
this
unexpected
remark
Pallet
answer
,
that
among
connoisseur
he
would
not
pretend
to
appraise
his
picture
;
but
that
,
in
value
his
work
,
he
be
oblige
to
have
an
eye
to
the
gothic
ignorance
of
the
age
in
which
he
live
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
see
at
once
into
the
nature
of
this
raffle
,
which
be
no
other
than
a
beg
shift
to
dispose
of
a
paultry
piece
,
that
he
could
not
otherwise
have
sell
for
twenty
shilling
.
<EOS>
however
,
far
from
shock
the
poor
man
in
distress
,
by
drop
the
least
hint
of
his
conjecture
,
he
desire
to
be
favour
with
six
chance
,
if
the
circumstance
of
his
plan
would
indulge
him
so
far
;
and
the
painter
,
after
some
hesitation
,
condescend
to
comply
with
his
request
,
out
of
pure
friendship
and
veneration
;
tho
'
he
observe
,
that
in
so
do
he
must
exclude
some
of
his
most
intimate
companion
.
    
<EOS>
have
receive
the
money
,
he
give
Pickle
his
address
,
desire
he
would
,
with
his
convenience
,
visit
the
princess
,
who
,
he
be
sure
,
would
display
her
most
engaging
attraction
,
in
order
to
captivate
his
fancy
;
and
take
his
leave
,
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
success
of
his
application
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
Peregrine
be
tempt
with
the
curiosity
of
see
this
portrait
,
which
he
imagine
must
contain
some
analogy
to
the
ridiculous
oddity
of
the
painter
,
he
would
not
expose
himself
to
the
disagreeable
alternative
of
applaud
the
performance
,
contrary
to
the
dictate
of
conscience
and
common
sense
,
or
of
condemn
it
,
to
the
unspeakable
mortification
of
the
miserable
author
;
and
therefore
never
dreamt
of
return
the
painter
's
visit
:
nor
do
he
ever
hear
of
the
lottery
's
be
draw
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
he
be
invite
to
spend
a
few
week
at
the
country
-
seat
of
a
certain
nobleman
,
with
whom
he
have
contract
an
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
his
debauch
,
which
we
have
already
describe
;
and
his
lordship
be
remarkable
for
his
skill
and
success
in
horse
-
racing
,
his
house
be
continually
fill
with
the
connoisseur
and
admirer
of
that
sport
,
upon
which
the
whole
conversation
turn
,
insomuch
that
Peregrine
gradually
imbibe
some
knowledge
in
horse
-
flesh
,
and
the
diversion
of
the
course
;
for
the
whole
occupation
of
the
day
,
exclusive
of
eating
and
drink
,
consist
in
view
,
manage
and
exercise
his
lordship
's
stud
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
look
upon
these
amusement
with
an
eye
of
taste
,
as
well
as
curiosity
;
he
contemplate
the
animal
as
a
beautiful
and
elegant
part
of
the
creation
,
and
relish
the
surprising
exertion
of
its
speed
with
a
refined
and
classical
delight
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
he
become
personally
acquaint
with
every
horse
in
the
stable
,
and
interest
himself
in
the
reputation
of
each
;
while
he
also
gratify
his
appetite
for
knowledge
,
in
observe
the
method
of
prepare
their
body
,
and
train
them
to
the
race
.
<EOS>
His
landlord
see
and
encourage
his
eagerness
,
from
which
he
promise
himself
some
advantage
;
he
form
several
private
match
for
his
entertainment
,
and
flatter
his
discernment
,
by
permit
him
to
be
successful
in
the
first
betts
he
make
.
<EOS>
thus
be
he
artfully
decoy
into
a
spirit
of
keenness
and
adventure
,
and
dispose
to
depend
upon
his
own
judgment
,
in
opposition
to
that
of
people
who
have
make
course
the
sole
study
of
their
life
.
<EOS>
He
accompany
my
lord
to
Newmarket
,
and
enter
at
once
into
the
genius
of
the
place
,
be
mark
as
fair
game
,
by
all
the
know
one
there
assemble
,
many
of
whom
find
mean
to
take
him
in
,
in
spite
of
all
the
caution
and
admonition
of
his
lordship
,
who
want
to
reserve
him
for
his
own
use
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
for
any
man
,
let
him
be
never
so
fearful
or
phlegmatic
,
to
be
an
unconcerned
spectator
in
this
busy
scene
.
<EOS>
the
daemon
of
play
hover
in
the
air
,
like
a
pestilential
vapour
,
taint
the
mind
of
all
present
with
infallible
infection
,
which
communicate
from
one
person
to
another
,
like
the
circulation
of
a
general
pannic
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
seize
with
this
epidemic
distemper
to
a
violent
degree
;
and
after
have
lose
a
few
loose
hundred
,
in
his
progress
through
the
various
rookery
of
the
place
,
enter
into
partnership
with
his
noble
friend
in
a
grand
match
,
upon
the
issue
of
which
he
venture
no
less
than
three
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
would
not
have
risque
such
a
considerable
sum
,
have
not
his
own
confidence
be
reinforce
by
the
opinion
and
concurrence
of
his
lordship
,
who
hazard
an
equal
bett
upon
the
same
event
.
<EOS>
these
two
associate
engage
themselves
in
the
penalty
of
six
thousand
pound
,
to
run
one
chaise
and
four
against
another
,
three
time
round
the
course
;
and
our
adventurer
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
his
antagonist
distance
in
the
first
and
second
heat
;
but
all
of
a
sudden
,
one
of
the
horse
of
his
machine
be
knock
up
,
by
which
accident
,
the
victory
be
ravish
almost
from
his
very
grasp
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
endure
the
damage
and
the
scorn
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
deeply
affected
with
this
misfortune
,
which
he
impute
to
his
own
extravagance
and
temerity
,
but
discover
no
external
sign
of
affliction
,
because
his
illustrious
partner
bear
his
loss
with
the
most
philosophic
resignation
,
console
himself
,
as
well
as
Pickle
,
with
the
hope
of
make
it
up
,
on
some
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
our
young
gentleman
could
not
help
admire
and
even
envy
his
equanimity
,
not
know
that
his
lordship
have
manage
matter
so
as
to
be
a
gainer
by
the
misfortune
;
which
to
retrieve
,
Peregrine
purchase
several
horse
,
at
the
recommendation
of
his
friend
;
and
instead
of
return
to
London
,
make
a
tour
with
him
to
all
the
celebrated
race
in
England
,
at
which
,
after
several
vicissitude
of
fortune
,
he
make
shift
,
before
the
end
of
the
season
,
to
treble
his
loss
.
    
<EOS>
but
his
hope
seem
to
increase
with
his
ill
luck
;
and
in
the
beginning
of
winter
he
come
to
town
,
fully
persuade
that
fortune
must
necessarily
change
,
and
that
next
season
he
should
reap
the
happy
fruit
of
his
experience
.
<EOS>
in
this
confidence
,
he
seem
to
drown
all
idea
of
prudence
and
oeconomy
;
his
former
expence
be
mere
parsimony
,
compare
with
that
which
he
now
incur
:
he
subscribe
to
the
opera
,
and
half
a
dozen
concert
at
different
part
of
the
town
;
be
a
benefactor
to
several
hospital
,
purchase
a
collection
of
valuable
picture
,
take
an
house
,
and
furnish
it
in
a
most
magnificent
taste
,
lay
in
a
large
stock
of
french
wine
,
and
give
extravagant
entertainment
to
his
quality
-
friend
,
who
in
return
load
him
with
compliment
,
and
insist
upon
his

and

Chapter
XCVII
<EOS>
He
be
take
into
the
protection
of
a
great
man
;
set
up
for
member
of
parliament
;
be
disappointed
in
his
expectation
,
and
find
himself
egregiously
outwit
.
   
<EOS>
among
these
profess
patron
,
the
great
part
of
whom
Peregrine
see
thro
'
,
there
be
one
great
personage
,
who
seem
to
support
with
dignity
the
sphere
in
which
fortune
have
place
him
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
Pickle
be
not
a
series
of
grin
complaisance
,
in
a
flat
repetition
of
general
expression
of
friendship
and
regard
.
    
<EOS>
He
demean
himself
with
a
seemingly
honest
reserve
,
in
point
of
profession
;
his
advance
to
Peregrine
appear
to
be
the
result
of
deliberation
and
experiment
;
he
chide
the
young
gentleman
for
his
extravagance
with
the
authority
of
a
parent
,
and
the
sincerity
of
a
fast
friend
;
and
have
,
by
gradual
inquiry
,
make
himself
acquaint
with
the
state
of
his
private
affair
,
condemn
his
conduct
with
an
air
of
candour
and
concern
.
<EOS>
He
represent
to
him
the
folly
and
dangerous
consequence
of
the
profligate
life
in
which
he
have
plunge
himself
,
counsel
him
with
great
warmth
to
sell
off
his
race
-
horse
,
which
would
otherwise
insensibly
eat
him
up
;
to
retrench
all
superfluous
expence
,
which
would
only
serve
to
expose
him
to
the
ridicule
and
ingratitude
of
those
who
be
benefit
by
it
;
to
lay
out
his
money
upon
secure
mortgage
,
at
good
interest
;
and
carry
into
execution
his
former
design
of
stand
candidate
for
a
borough
,
at
the
ensue
election
for
a
new
parliament
;
in
which
case
,
this
nobleman
promise
to
assist
him
with
his
influence
and
advice
;
assure
him
,
that
if
he
could
once
procure
a
seat
in
the
house
,
he
may
look
upon
his
fortune
as
already
make
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
perceive
the
wisdom
and
sanity
of
this
advice
,
for
which
he
make
his
acknowledgment
to
his
generous
monitor
,
protest
that
he
would
adhere
to
it
in
every
particular
,
and
immediately
set
about
a
reformation
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
take
cognizance
of
his
most
minute
affair
,
and
after
an
exact
scrutiny
,
give
his
patron
to
understand
,
that
,
exclusive
of
his
furniture
,
his
fortune
be
reduce
to
fourteen
thousand
three
hundred
and
thirty
pound
,
in
Bank
and
South
-
Sea
annuity
,
over
and
above
the
garison
and
its
appendage
,
which
he
reckon
at
sixty
pound
a
year
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
desire
,
that
as
his
lordship
have
be
so
kind
as
to
favour
him
with
his
friendship
and
advice
,
he
would
extend
his
generosity
still
farther
,
by
put
him
in
a
way
of
make
the
most
advantage
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
My
lord
say
,
that
for
his
own
part
he
do
not
chuse
to
meddle
in
money
-
matter
;
that
he
would
find
abundance
of
people
ready
to
borrow
it
upon
land
-
security
;
but
that
he
ought
to
be
extremely
cautious
in
a
transaction
of
such
consequence
;
promise
at
the
same
time
,
to
employ
his
own
steward
,
in
seek
out
a
mortgager
to
whom
it
may
be
safely
lend
.
    
<EOS>
this
agent
be
accordingly
set
at
work
,
and
for
a
few
day
make
a
fruitless
inquiry
;
so
that
the
young
gentleman
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
his
own
intelligence
,
by
which
he
get
notice
of
several
people
of
repute
credit
,
who
offer
him
mortgage
for
the
whole
sum
;
but
when
he
make
a
report
of
the
particular
to
his
noble
friend
,
his
lordship
start
such
doubt
and
objection
relate
to
each
,
that
he
be
deter
from
enter
into
any
engagement
with
the
proposer
;
congratulate
himself
,
in
the
mean
time
,
on
his
good
fortune
,
in
be
favour
with
the
advice
and
direction
of
such
a
sage
counsellor
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
begin
to
be
impatient
,
after
have
unsuccessfully
consult
all
the
money
-
broker
and
conveyancer
about
town
,
and
resolve
to
try
the
expedient
of
a
public
advertisement
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
persuade
by
my
lord
to
postpone
that
experiment
,
until
every
other
method
should
have
fail
,
because
it
would
attract
the
attention
of
all
the
pettifogger
in
London
,
who
(
though
they
may
not
be
able
to
overreach
)
<EOS>
would
infallibly
harrass
and
teize
him
out
of
all
tranquillity
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
back
of
this
conversation
that
Peregrine
,
chance
to
meet
the
steward
near
his
lord
's
house
,
stop
him
in
the
street
,
to
give
him
an
account
of
his
bad
luck
;
at
which
the
other
express
some
concern
,
and
rub
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
in
a
musing
posture
,
tell
Pickle
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
thought
just
come
into
his
head
,
point
out
one
way
of
do
his
business
effectually
.
<EOS>
the
youth
,
upon
this
intimation
,
begg'd
he
would
accompany
him
to
the
next
coffee
-
house
,
in
which
have
choose
a
private
situation
,
this
grave
manager
give
him
to
understand
,
that
a
part
of
my
lord
's
estate
be
mortgage
,
in
consequence
of
a
debt
contract
by
his
grandfather
,
for
provision
to
the
young
child
of
the
family
;
and
that
the
equity
of
redemption
would
be
foreclose
in
a
few
month
,
unless
the
burthen
could
be
discharge
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
(
say
he
)
have
always
live
in
a
splendid
manner
,
and
notwithstanding
his
ample
fortune
,
together
with
the
profit
accrue
from
the
post
he
enjoy
,
he
save
so
little
money
,
that
,
upon
this
occasion
,
I
know
he
will
be
oblige
to
borrow
ten
thousand
pound
,
to
make
up
the
sum
that
be
requisite
to
redeem
the
mortgage
.
<EOS>
now
,
certain
i'am
,
that
when
his
design
come
to
be
know
,
he
will
be
sollicite
on
all
hand
,
by
people
desirous
of
lend
money
upon
such
undoubted
security
;
and
'
tis
odd
<EOS>
but
he
have
already
promise
the
preference
to
some
particular
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
know
he
have
your
interest
very
much
at
heart
,
I
will
(
if
you
please
)
sound
his
lordship
upon
the
subject
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
give
you
notice
of
my
success
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
ravish
with
the
prospect
of
settle
this
affair
so
much
to
his
satisfaction
,
thank
the
steward
for
his
friendly
hint
and
undertaking
,
which
he
assure
him
should
be
acknowledge
by
a
more
solid
proof
of
his
gratitude
,
provide
the
business
could
be
bring
to
bear
;
and
next
day
,
he
be
visit
by
this
kind
manager
,
with
the
happy
news
of
his
lordship
's
have
consent
to
borrow
ten
thousand
pound
of
his
stock
,
upon
mortgage
,
at
the
interest
of
five
per
Cent
.
<EOS>
this
information
he
receive
as
an
instance
of
the
singular
esteem
of
his
noble
patron
;
and
the
paper
be
immediately
draw
and
execute
,
the
money
be
deposit
in
the
hand
of
the
mortgager
,
who
,
in
the
hearing
of
the
lender
,
lay
strong
injunction
on
his
steward
to
pay
the
interest
punctually
at
quarter
-
day
.
    
<EOS>
the
good
part
of
our
hero
's
fortune
be
thus
happily
deposit
,
and
the
agent
gratify
with
a
present
of
fifty
piece
,
he
begin
to
put
his
retrench
scheme
in
execution
;
all
his
servant
(
pipe
except
)
be
discharge
,
his
chariot
and
running
-
horse
dispose
of
,
his
house
-
keeping
break
up
,
and
his
furniture
sell
by
auction
:
nay
,
the
heat
of
his
disposition
be
as
remarkable
in
this
,
as
in
any
other
transaction
of
his
life
;
for
every
step
of
his
saving
project
be
take
with
such
eagerness
,
and
even
precipitation
,
that
most
of
his
companion
think
he
be
either
ruin
or
mad
.
<EOS>
but
he
answer
all
their
expostulation
with
a
string
of
prudent
apophthegm
,
such
as
,
"
the
short
folly
be
the
good
;
"
"
well
to
retrench
upon
conviction
than
compulsion
;
"
and
diver
other
wise
maxim
,
seemingly
the
result
of
experience
and
philosophic
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
to
such
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
do
his
present
oeconomy
prevail
,
that
he
be
actually
seize
with
the
desire
of
amass
;
and
as
he
every
day
receive
proposal
,
from
those
broker
whom
he
have
employ
,
about
the
disposal
of
his
cash
,
he
at
length
venture
fifteen
hundred
pound
upon
bottomry
,
be
tempt
by
the
excessive
premium
.
    
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
observe
,
for
the
honour
of
our
adventurer
,
that
this
reformation
do
not
at
all
interfere
with
the
good
quality
of
his
heart
:
he
be
still
as
friendly
and
benevolent
as
ever
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
liberality
be
more
subjected
to
the
restraint
of
reason
;
and
he
may
have
justly
plead
,
in
vindication
of
his
generosity
,
that
he
retrench
the
superfluity
in
his
own
way
of
living
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
power
of
assist
his
fellow
-
creature
in
distress
.
<EOS>
Numberless
be
the
object
to
which
he
extend
his
charity
in
private
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
exert
this
virtue
in
secret
,
not
only
on
account
of
avoid
the
charge
of
ostentation
,
but
also
because
he
be
ashamed
of
be
detect
in
such
an
awkward
unfashionable
practice
,
by
the
censorious
observer
of
this
humane
generation
.
<EOS>
in
this
particular
,
he
seem
to
confound
the
idea
of
virtue
and
vice
;
for
he
do
good
as
other
people
do
evil
,
that
is
,
by
stealth
;
and
be
so
capricious
in
point
of
behaviour
,
that
frequently
,
in
public
,
he
wag
his
tongue
in
satirical
animadversion
upon
that
poverty
,
which
his
hand
have
,
in
private
,
relieved
.
<EOS>
yet
,
far
from
shun
the
acquaintance
,
or
discourage
the
solicitation
of
those
who
,
he
think
,
want
his
assistance
,
he
be
always
accessible
,
open
,
and
complacent
to
them
,
even
when
the
haughtiness
of
his
temper
keep
his
superior
at
a
distance
;
and
often
save
a
modest
man
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
declare
himself
,
by
penetrate
into
his
necessity
,
and
anticipate
his
request
,
in
a
frank
offer
of
his
purse
and
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
not
that
he
practise
this
beneficence
to
all
the
needy
of
his
acquaintance
,
without
distinction
;
there
be
always
a
set
of
idle
profligate
fellow
,
who
have
squander
away
their
own
fortune
,
and
conquer
all
sense
of
honour
and
shame
,
maintain
themselves
by
borrow
from
those
who
have
not
yet
finish
the
same
career
,
and
want
resolution
to
resist
their
importunate
demand
.
<EOS>
to
these
he
be
always
inflexible
;
though
he
could
not
absolutely
detach
himself
from
their
company
,
because
,
by
dint
of
effrontery
,
and
such
of
their
original
connexion
as
they
have
be
able
to
retain
,
they
find
admission
to
all
place
of
fashionable
resort
.
    
<EOS>
several
insuccessful
attack
have
be
make
upon
his
pocket
,
by
beggar
of
this
class
,
one
of
the
most
artful
of
whom
,
have
one
day
join
him
in
the
Mall
,
and
make
the
usual
observation
on
the
weather
,
damn
the
fog
of
London
,
and
begin
a
dissertation
on
the
difference
of
air
,
prefer
that
of
the
county
in
which
he
be
bear
,
to
any
climate
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
ever
in
Gloucestershire
?
"
(
say
he
to
Peregrine
)
who
reply
in
the
negative
,
he
thus
go
on
:
"
I
have
get
a
house
there
,
where
I
should
be
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
down
together
,
during
the
Easter
-
holiday
;
I
can
promise
you
good
country
-
fare
and
wholesome
exercise
;
for
I
have
every
thing
within
myself
,
and
as
good
a
pack
of
fox
-
hound
as
any
in
the
three
kingdom
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
expatiate
upon
the
elegance
of
the
house
,
which
to
be
sure
be
an
old
building
;
and
these
,
you
know
,
be
generally
cold
,
and
not
very
convenient
.
<EOS>
but
,
curse
the
house
!
<EOS>
the
dirty
acre
about
it
be
the
thing
;
and
a
damn'd
fine
parcel
they
be
,
to
be
sure
.
    
<EOS>
if
my
old
grandmother
be
dead
 
<EOS>
she
can
not
live
another
season
,
for
she
be
turn
of
fourscore
,
and
quite
wear
out
:
<EOS>
nay
,
as
for
that
matter
,
I
believe
I
have
get
a
letter
in
my
pocket
,
give
an
account
of
her
be
despair
of
by
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
 
<EOS>
no
,
<EOS>
d####n
it
,
I
leave
it
at
home
,
in
the
pocket
of
another
coat
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
from
the
beginning
of
this
harangue
,
see
its
tendency
,
seem
to
yield
the
most
serious
attention
to
what
he
say
;
break
in
upon
it
,
every
now
and
then
,
with
the
interjection
,
Hum
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
the
deuce
!
<EOS>
and
several
civil
question
,
from
which
the
other
conceive
happy
omen
of
success
;
till
perceive
they
have
advance
as
far
as
the
passage
into
St
James
's
,
the
mischievous
youth
interrupt
him
all
at
once
,
say
,
"
I
see
you
be
for
the
end
of
the
walk
;
this
be
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
take
his
leave
of
the
saunterer
,
who
would
have
delay
his
retreat
,
by
call
to
him
aloud
,
that
he
have
not
yet
describe
the
situation
of
his
castle
.
<EOS>
but
Peregrine
,
without
stop
,
answer
in
the
same
tone
,
"
another
time
will
do
as
well
;
"
and
in
a
moment
disappear
,
leave
the
projector
very
much
mortify
with
his
disappointment
;
for
his
intention
be
to
close
the
description
,
with
a
demand
of
twenty
piece
,
to
be
repay
out
of
the
first
remittance
he
should
receive
from
his
estate
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
for
our
hero
,
have
he
always
act
with
the
same
circumspection
:
but
he
have
his
unguarded
moment
,
in
which
he
fall
a
prey
to
the
unsuspecting
integrity
of
his
own
heart
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
a
person
among
the
number
of
his
acquaintance
,
whose
conversation
he
particularly
relish
,
because
it
be
frank
,
agreeable
,
and
fraught
with
many
sensible
observation
upon
the
craft
and
treachery
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
make
shift
to
discuss
a
very
genteel
fortune
,
though
it
be
spend
with
taste
and
reputation
,
and
now
be
reduce
to
his
shift
for
the
maintenance
of
his
family
,
which
consist
of
a
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
destitute
of
the
necessary
of
life
,
be
comfortably
supply
by
the
bounty
of
his
friend
:
but
this
be
a
provision
not
at
all
suit
to
his
inclination
;
and
he
have
endeavour
,
by
diver
unsuccessful
scheme
,
to
retrieve
his
former
independency
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
happen
one
evening
to
be
sit
alone
in
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
over
-
hear
a
conversation
between
this
schemer
and
another
gentleman
,
touch
an
affair
that
engage
his
attention
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
have
be
leave
trustee
for
fifteen
hundred
pound
bequeath
to
the
other
's
daughter
by
an
aunt
,
and
be
strongly
solicit
to
pay
the
money
to
the
child
's
father
,
who
assure
him
,
he
have
then
an
opportunity
to
lay
it
out
in
such
a
manner
,
as
would
greatly
conduce
to
the
advantage
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
the
trustee
remind
him
of
the
nature
of
his
charge
,
which
make
him
accountable
for
the
money
,
until
the
child
should
have
attain
the
age
of
eighteen
;
but
at
the
same
time
give
him
to
understand
,
that
if
he
could
procure
such
security
as
would
indemnify
him
from
the
consequence
,
he
would
forthwith
pay
the
legacy
into
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
proposal
the
father
reply
,
that
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
he
would
risque
the
fortune
of
his
only
child
,
upon
any
idle
or
precarious
issue
;
and
therefore
he
think
it
reasonable
,
that
he
should
have
the
use
of
it
in
the
mean
time
;
and
that
,
as
to
security
,
he
be
loth
to
trouble
any
of
his
friend
about
an
affair
which
may
be
compromise
without
their
interposition
;
observe
,
that
he
would
not
look
upon
his
condescension
as
a
favour
,
if
obtain
by
a
security
,
on
which
he
could
borrow
the
same
sum
from
any
usurer
in
town
.
    
<EOS>
after
much
importunity
on
one
side
,
and
evasion
on
the
other
,
the
money'd
gentleman
tell
him
,
that
though
he
would
not
surrender
the
sum
deposit
in
his
hand
,
for
the
use
of
his
daughter
,
he
would
lend
him
what
he
should
have
occasion
for
,
in
the
mean
time
;
and
if
,
upon
her
being
of
age
,
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
her
concurrence
,
the
money
should
be
place
to
her
account
;
provide
he
could
find
any
person
of
credit
,
who
would
join
with
him
in
a
bond
,
for
the
assurance
of
the
lender
.
<EOS>
this
proviso
be
an
obstruction
which
the
other
would
not
have
be
able
to
surmount
,
without
great
difficulty
,
have
not
his
cause
be
espouse
by
our
hero
,
who
think
it
be
pity
<EOS>
a
man
of
honour
and
understanding
should
suffer
in
his
principal
concern
,
on
such
a
paultry
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
presume
on
his
acquaintance
,
interpose
in
the
conversation
as
a
friend
,
who
interest
himself
in
the
affair
;
and
be
fully
inform
of
the
particular
,
offer
himself
as
a
security
for
the
lender
.
    
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
a
stranger
to
Peregrine
,
be
next
day
make
acquaint
with
his
fund
;
and
,
without
farth
scruple
,
accommodate
his
friend
with
one
thousand
pound
,
for
which
he
take
their
bond
,
payable
in
six
month
,
though
he
protest
that
the
money
should
never
be
demand
,
until
the
infant
should
be
of
age
,
unless
some
accident
should
happen
which
he
could
not
then
foresee
.
<EOS>
Pickle
believe
this
declaration
sincere
,
because
he
could
have
no
interest
in
dissemble
:
but
what
he
chiefly
depend
upon
,
for
his
own
security
,
be
the
integrity
and
confidence
of
the
borrower
,
who
assure
him
,
that
happen
what
will
,
he
should
be
able
to
stand
between
him
and
all
danger
;
the
nature
of
his
plan
be
such
,
as
would
infallibly
treble
the
sum
in
a
very
few
month
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
after
this
transaction
,
writ
be
issue
out
for
elect
a
new
parliament
,
our
adventurer
,
by
the
advice
of
his
patron
,
go
into
the
country
,
in
order
to
canvass
for
a
borough
,
and
line
his
pocket
with
a
competent
share
of
bank
-
note
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
this
project
,
he
unfortunately
happen
to
interfere
with
the
interest
of
a
great
family
in
the
opposition
,
who
,
for
a
long
series
of
year
,
have
make
member
for
that
place
;
and
be
now
so
much
offend
at
the
intrusion
of
our
young
gentleman
,
that
they
threaten
to
spend
ten
thousand
pound
in
frustrate
his
design
.
<EOS>
this
menace
be
no
other
than
an
incitement
to
Peregrine
,
who
confide
so
much
in
his
own
influence
and
address
,
that
he
verily
believe
he
should
be
able
to
baffle
his
grace
,
even
in
his
own
territory
,
and
by
that
victory
establish
his
reputation
and
interest
with
the
minister
,
who
,
through
the
recommendation
of
his
noble
friend
,
countenance
his
cause
,
and
would
have
be
very
well
pleased
to
see
one
of
his
great
enemy
suffer
such
a
disgraceful
overthrow
,
which
would
have
,
moreover
,
in
a
great
measure
shake
his
credit
with
his
faction
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
intoxicate
with
the
idea
of
pride
and
ambition
,
put
all
his
talent
to
the
test
,
in
the
execution
of
this
project
.
<EOS>
He
spare
no
expence
in
treat
the
elector
;
but
find
himself
rival
,
in
this
respect
,
by
his
competitor
,
who
be
powerfully
support
,
he
have
recourse
to
those
qualification
in
which
he
think
himself
superior
.
<EOS>
He
make
ball
for
the
lady
,
visit
the
matron
of
the
corporation
,
adapt
himself
to
their
various
humour
with
surprising
facility
,
drink
with
those
who
love
a
cherish
cup
in
private
,
make
love
to
the
amorous
,
pray
with
the
religious
,
gossip
with
those
who
delight
in
scandal
,
and
with
great
sagacity
contrive
agreeable
present
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
most
effectual
method
of
engage
such
elector
as
be
under
the
influence
of
their
wife
;
and
as
for
the
rest
,
he
assail
them
in
their
own
way
,
set
whole
hogshead
of
beer
and
wine
abroach
,
for
the
benefit
of
all
comer
;
and
into
those
sordid
heart
that
liquor
would
not
open
,
he
find
mean
to
convey
himself
by
the
help
of
a
golden
key
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
exert
himself
,
his
antagonist
be
not
idle
;
his
age
and
infirmity
would
not
permit
him
to
enter
personally
into
their
party
;
but
his
steward
and
adherent
bestir
themselves
with
great
industry
and
perseverance
;
and
the
market
for
vote
run
so
high
,
that
Pickle
's
ready
money
be
exhaust
before
the
day
of
election
;
and
he
be
oblige
to
write
to
his
patron
an
account
of
the
dilemma
to
which
he
be
reduce
;
intreate
him
to
take
such
speedy
measure
,
as
would
enable
him
to
finish
the
business
which
he
have
so
happily
begin
.
    
<EOS>
this
nobleman
communicate
the
circumstance
of
the
case
to
the
minister
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
<EOS>
our
candidate
find
credit
with
the
receiver
-
general
of
the
county
,
who
lend
him
twelve
hundred
pound
on
his
personal
note
,
payable
on
demand
.
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
new
supply
,
he
manage
matter
so
successfully
,
that
an
evident
majority
of
vote
be
secure
in
his
interest
;
and
nothing
could
have
obstruct
his
election
,
have
not
the
noble
peer
who
set
up
his
competitor
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
shame
and
mortification
of
be
foil
in
his
own
borough
,
offer
to
compromise
the
affair
with
his
honour
,
by
give
up
two
member
in
another
place
,
provide
the
opposition
should
cease
in
his
own
corporation
.
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
greedily
embrace
;
and
,
on
the
eve
of
election
,
Peregrine
receive
an
intimation
from
his
patron
,
desire
him
to
quit
his
pretension
,
on
pain
of
his
and
the
minister
's
displeasure
;
and
promise
that
he
should
be
elect
for
another
place
.
    
<EOS>
no
other
disappointment
in
life
could
have
give
him
such
chagrin
as
he
feel
at
the
receit
of
this
tantalizing
order
,
by
which
the
cup
of
success
be
snatch
from
his
lip
,
and
all
the
vanity
of
his
ambitious
hope
humble
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
He
curs'd
<EOS>
the
whole
chain
of
his
court
connexion
,
inveigh
with
great
animosity
against
the
rascally
scheme
of
politick
,
to
which
he
be
sacrifice
;
and
in
conclusion
swore
he
would
not
give
up
the
fruit
of
his
own
address
for
the
pleasure
of
any
minister
upon
earth
.
    
<EOS>
this
laudable
resolution
,
however
,
be
render
ineffectual
by
his
friend
the
receiver
-
general
,
who
be
bearer
of
the
message
,
and
(
after
have
,
in
vain
,
endeavour
to
persuade
him
to
submission
)
<EOS>
fairly
arrest
him
upon
the
spot
for
the
money
he
have
advance
;
this
expedient
be
perform
by
virtue
of
a
writ
which
he
have
be
advise
to
take
out
,
in
case
the
young
man
should
prove
refractory
.
    
<EOS>
the
reader
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
must
be
pretty
well
acquaint
with
the
disposition
of
our
adventurer
,
may
easily
conceive
how
he
relish
this
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
all
the
faculty
of
his
soul
be
swallow
up
in
astonishment
and
indignation
;
and
some
minute
elapse
before
his
nerve
would
obey
the
impulse
of
his
rage
,
which
manifest
itself
in
such
an
application
to
the
temple
of
the
plaintiff
,
as
lay
him
sprawl
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
this
assault
,
which
be
commit
in
a
tavern
whither
he
have
be
purposely
decoy
,
attract
the
regard
of
the
bailiff
and
his
follower
,
who
,
to
the
number
of
four
,
rush
upon
him
at
once
,
in
order
to
overpower
him
;
but
his
wrath
inspire
him
with
such
additional
strength
and
agility
,
that
he
disengage
himself
from
them
in
a
trice
,
and
seize
a
poker
,
which
be
the
first
weapon
that
present
itself
to
his
hand
,
exercise
it
upon
their
skull
with
incredible
dexterity
and
execution
.
    
<EOS>
the
officer
himself
,
who
have
be
the
first
that
presume
to
lay
violent
hand
upon
him
,
feel
the
first
effect
of
his
fury
,
in
a
blow
upon
the

,
in
consequence
of
which
he
lose
three
of
his
tooth
,
and
fall
athwart
the
body
of
the
receiver
,
with
which
he
form'd
<EOS>
the
figure
of
a
St
Andrew
's
cross
:
one
of
his
myrmidon
see
the
fate
of
his
chief
,
would
not
venture
to
attack
the
victor
in
front
,
but
wheel
to
one
side
,
make
an
attempt
upon
him
in
flank
,
and
be
receive
obliquely
by
our
hero
's
left
hand
and
foot
,
so
masterly
disposed
to
the
right
side
of
his
leg
,
and
the
left
side
of
his
neck
,
that
he
bolt
head
foremost
into
the
chimney
,
where
his
chin
be

by
the

,
which
,
in
a
moment
,
sear
him
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the

do
not
think
proper
to
maintain
the

,
but
evacuate
the
room
with
great
expedition
,
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
,
and
bellow
aloud
to
the

's
servant
,
beseech
them
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
their

who
be

Mean

while
,
this

have
recollect
himself
,
demand
a
parley
;
which
have
with
difficulty
obtain

our
incensed

in

of
the
most
submissive

he
complain
grievously
of
the
young
gentleman
's
intemperance
and
heat
of
disposition
,
and
very
calmly
represent
the
danger
of
his
rashness
and
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
outrageous
or
idle
,
than
the
resistance
he
have
make
against
the
law
of
his
country
,
because
he
would
find
it
impracticable
to
withstand
the
whole
executive
power
of
the
county
,
which
he
could
easily
raise
to
apprehend
and
secure
him
;
that
over
and
above
the
disgrace
that
would
accrue
to
him
from
this
imprudent
conduct
,
he
would
knock
his
own
interest
on
the
head
,
by
disoblige
his
friend
in
the
administration
,
who
be
,
to
his
knowledge
,
at
present
very
well
disposed
to
do
him
service
;
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
what
he
have
do
be
by
the
express
order
of
his
superior
,
and
not
out
of
any
desire
of
distress
him
;
and
that
,
far
from
be
his
enemy
,
notwithstanding
the
shocking
insult
he
have
sustain
,
he
be
ready
to
withdraw
the

he
would
listen
to
any
reasonable
term
of

<EOS>
Peregrine

who
be
not
more
prone
to
anger
than
open
to
conviction
,
be
appease
by
his
condescension
,
move
by
his
argument
,
and
chid
by
his
own
reflection
for
what
he
have
do
in
the
precipitation
of

they
enter
into
a
conference
,
the
result
of
which
be
our

immediate
departure
for

:
so
that

by

give
him
to
understand
the
motive
that
induce
the

to
quit

of
his

XCVIII
Peregrine
commence
minister
's
dependent
;
meet
by
accident
with
Mrs
Gauntlet
;
and
descend
gradually
,
in
the
condition
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
this
reception
,
favourable
as
it
be
<EOS>
,
do
not
please
Peregrine
,
who
have
too
much
discernment
to
be
cajole
with
general
promise
,
at
a
time
when
he
think
himself
intitle
to
the
most
particular
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
signify
his
disgust
to
his
introductor
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
lay
his
account
with
be
choose
representative
of
one
of
those
borough
for
which
he
have
be
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
agree
to
the
reasonableness
of
his
expectation
,
observe
,
however
,
that
he
could
not
suppose
the
minister
would
enter
upon
business
with
him
,
on
his
first
visit
;
and
that
it
would
be
time
enough
,
at
his
next
audience
,
to
communicate
his
demand
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
remonstrance
,
our
hero
continue
to
indulge
his
suspicion
and
chagrin
,
and
even
make
a
point
of
it
with
his
patron
,
that
his
lordship
should
next
day
make
application
in
his
behalf
,
lest
the
two
seat
should
be
fill
up
,
on
pretence
of
his
inclination
be
be
unknown
.
    
<EOS>
thus
importune
,
my
lord
go
to
his
principal
,
and
return
with
an
answer
,
import
that
his
honour
be
extremely
sorry
that
Mr
Pickle
have
not
signify
his
request
before
the
borough
in
question
be
promise
to
two
gentleman
whom
he
could
not
now
disappoint
,
with
any
regard
to
his
own
credit
or
interest
;
but
as
several
person
who
would
be
choose
be
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
very
aged
and
infirm
,
he
do
not
doubt
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
vacant
seat
in
a
very
short
time
;
and
then
the
young
gentleman
may
depend
upon
his
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
so
much
irritated
at
this
intimation
,
that
in
the
first
transport
of
his
anger
he
forget
the
respect
he
owe
to
his
friend
,
and
in
his
presence
inveigh
against
the
minister
,
as
a
person
devoid
of
gratitude
and
candour
,
protest
,
that
if
ever
an
opportunity
should
offer
itself
,
he
would
spend
the
whole
remain
of
his
fortune
in
oppose
his
measure
.
<EOS>
the
nobleman
have
give
him
time
to
exhaust
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
rebuke
him
very
calmly
for
his
disrespectful
expression
,
which
be
equally
injurious
and
indiscreet
;
assure
him
that
his
project
of
revenge
,
if
ever
put
in
execution
,
would
redound
to
his
own
prejudice
and
confusion
;
and
advise
him
to
cultivate
and
improve
,
with
patience
and
assiduity
,
<EOS>
the
footing
he
have
already
obtain
in
the
minister
's
good
grace
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
convince
of
the
truth
,
tho
'
not
satisfied
with
the
occasion
of
his
admonition
,
take
his
leave
in
a
fit
of
sullen
discontent
,
and
begin
to
ruminate
upon
the
shatter
posture
of
his
affair
.
    
<EOS>
all
that
now
remain
of
the
ample
fortune
he
have
inherit
,
be
the
sum
he
have
deposit
in
his
lordship
's
hand
,
together
with
fifteen
hundred
pound
he
have
venture
on
bottomry
,
and
the
garison
,
which
he
have
leave
for
the
use
and
accommodation
of
the
lieutenant
;
and
on
the
per
contra
side
of
his
account
he
be
debtor
for
the
supply
he
have
receive
from
the
receiver
-
general
,
and
the
money
for
which
he
be
bind
in
behalf
of
his
friend
;
so
that
he
find
himself
,
for
the
first
time
of
his
life
,
very
much
embarasse
in
his
circumstance
:
<EOS>
for
,
of
the
first
half
year
's
interest
of
his
ten
thousand
,
which
be
punctually
pay
,
he
have
but
fourscore
pound
in
bank
,
without
any
prospect
of
a
farth
supply
,
till
the
other
term
,
which
be
at
the
distance
of
four
long
month
.
<EOS>
He
seriously
reflect
upon
the
uncertainty
of
human
affair
;
the
ship
with
his
fifteen
hundred
pound
may
be
lose
,
the
gentleman
for
whom
he
be
security
,
may
miscarry
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
his
former
project
,
and
the
minister
may
one
day
,
through
policy
or
displeasure
,
expose
him
to
the
mercy
of
his
dependant
,
who
be
in
possession
of
his
note
.
    
<EOS>
these
suggestion
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
ease
of
our
adventurer
's
mind
,
already
ruffle
by
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
He
curse
his
own
folly
and
extravagance
,
by
which
he
be
reduce
to
such
an
uncomfortable
situation
.
<EOS>
He
compare
his
own
conduct
with
that
of
some
young
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
,
while
he
be
squander
away
the
good
part
of
his
inheritance
,
have
improve
their
fortune
,
strengthen
their
interest
,
and
increase
their
reputation
.
<EOS>
He
be
abandon
by
his
gayety
and
good
humour
,
his
countenance
gradually
contract
itself
into
a
representation
of
severity
and
care
,
he
drop
all
his
amusement
and
the
companion
of
his
pleasure
,
and
turn
his
whole
attention
to
the
minister
,
at
whose
levee
he
never
fail
to
appear
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
labour
in
the
wheel
of
dependance
,
with
all
that
mortification
which
a
youth
of
his
pride
and
sensibility
may
be
suppose
to
feel
from
such
a
disagreeable
necessity
,
he
one
day
hear
himself
call
by
name
,
as
he
cross
the
Park
;
and
turn
,
perceive
the
wife
of
captain
Gauntlet
,
with
another
lady
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
recognize
the
kind
Sophy
,
than
he
accost
her
with
his
wonte
civility
of
friendship
;
but
his
former
sprightly
air
be
metamorphose
into
such
an
austerity
,
or
rather
dejection
of
feature
,
that
she
could
scarce
believe
her
own
eye
;
and
in
her
astonishment
"
be
it
possible
(
say
she
)
that
the
gay
Mr
Pickle
should
be
so
much
alter
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
!
"
<EOS>
He
make
no
other
reply
to
this
exclamation
,
but
by
a
languid
smile
;
and
ask
how
long
she
have
be
in
town
;
observe
,
that
he
would
have
pay
his
compliment
to
her
at
her
own
lodging
,
have
he
be
favour
with
the
least
intimation
of
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
after
have
thank
him
for
his
politeness
,
she
tell
him
,
it
be
not
owe
to
any
abatement
of
her
friendship
and
esteem
for
him
,
that
she
have
omit
to
give
him
that
notice
;
but
his
abrupt
departure
from
Windsor
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
quit
Mr
Gauntlet
,
have
give
her
just
ground
to
believe
,
that
they
have
incur
his
displeasure
;
<EOS>
which
suspicion
be
reinforce
by
his
long
silence
and
neglect
from
that
period
,
to
the
present
time
;
when
she
observe
,
it
be
still
farther
confirm
,
by
his
forbear
to
inquire
for
Emilia
and
her
brother
:
<EOS>
"
Judge
then
,
(
say
she
)
if
I
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
you
would
be
pleased
to
hear
that
I
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
not
detain
you
at
present
,
because
you
seem
to
be
engage
about
some
particular
business
;
but
,
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
at
breakfast
to
-
morrow
,
I
shall
be
much
pleased
,
and
honour
to
boot
,
by
the
visit
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
give
him
a
direction
to
her
lodging
;
and
he
take
his
leave
,
with
a
faithful
promise
of
see
her
at
the
appoint
time
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
affect
with
this
advance
of
Sophy
,
which
he
consider
as
an
instance
of
her
uncommon
sweetness
of
temper
;
he
feel
strange
longing
of
return
friendship
towards
Godfrey
;
and
the
remembrance
of
Emilia
melt
his
heart
,
already
soften
with
grief
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
he
do
not
neglect
his
engagement
,
and
have
the
pleasure
of
enjoy
a
long
conversation
with
this
sensible
young
lady
,
who
give
him
to
understand
,
that
her
husband
be
with
his
regiment
;
and
present
to
him
a
fine
boy
,
the
first
fruit
of
their
love
,
whom
they
have
christen
by
the
name
of
Peregrine
,
in
memory
of
the
friendship
which
have
subsist
between
Godfrey
and
our
youth
.
    
<EOS>
this
proof
of
their
regard
,
notwithstanding
the
interruption
in
their
correspondence
,
make
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
,
who
have
make
the
warm
acknowledgement
for
this
undeserved
mark
of
respect
,
take
the
child
in
his
arm
,
and
almost
devour
him
with
kiss
,
protest
before
God
,
that
he
should
always
consider
him
with
the
tenderness
of
a
parent
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
high
compliment
he
could
pay
to
the
gentle
Sophy
,
who
again
kindly
chide
him
for
his
disdainful
and
precipitate
retreat
,
immediately
after
her
marriage
;
and
express
an
earnest
desire
of
see
him
and
the
captain
reconcile
.
    
<EOS>
He
assure
her
,
nothing
could
give
him
great
satisfaction
than
such
an
event
,
to
which
he
would
contribute
all
that
lie
in
his
power
,
though
he
could
not
help
look
upon
himself
as
injure
by
captain
Gauntlet
's
behaviour
,
which
denote
a
suspicion
of
his
honour
,
as
well
as
contempt
for
his
understanding
.
<EOS>
the
lady
undertake
for
the
concession
of
her
husband
,
who
(
she
tell
him
)
have
be
extremely
sorry
for
his
own
heat
,
after
Mr
Pickle
's
departure
,
and
would
have
follow
him
to
the
garison
,
in
order
to
solicit
his
forgiveness
,
have
not
he
be
restrain
by
certain
punctilio
's
,
occasion
by
some
acrimonious
expression
that
dropt
from
Peregrine
at
the
inn
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
clear
up
this
misunderstanding
,
she
proceed
to
give
an
account
of
Emilia
,
<EOS>
whose
behaviour
,
at
that
juncture
,
plainly
indicate
a
continuance
of
affection
for
her
first
lover
;
and
desire
,
that
he
would
give
her
full
power
to
bring
that
matter
also
to
an
accommodation
:
"
<EOS>
for
I
be
not
more
certain
of
my
own
existence
(
say
she
)
than
that
you
be
still
in
possession
of
my
sister
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
at
this
declaration
,
the
tear
start
in
his
eye
,
while
he
shake
his
head
,
and
decline
her
good
office
,
wish
that
the
young
lady
may
be
much
more
happy
than
ever
he
should
be
able
to
make
her
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
confound
at
these
expression
,
and
move
by
the
despondent
manner
in
which
they
be
deliver
,
begg'd
to
know
if
any
new
obstacle
be
raise
,
by
some
late
change
in
his
sentiment
or
situation
:
and
he
,
in
order
to
avoid
a
painful
explanation

tell
her
,
that
he
have
long
despair
of
be
able
to
vanquish
Emilia
's
resentment
,
and
for
that
reason
quit
the
pursuit
,
which
he
would
never
renew
,
howsoever
his
heart
may
suffer
by
that
resolution
;
though
he
take
heaven
to
witness
,
that
his
love
,
esteem
,
and
admiration
of
her
be
not
in
the
least
impaired
:
but
the
true
motive
of
his
lay
aside
this
design
,
be
the
consciousness
of
his
decayed
fortune
,
which
,
by
add
to
the
sensibility
of
his
pride
,
increase
the
horror
of
another
repulse

<EOS>
She
express
her
concern
for
this
determination
,
both
on
his
own
account
,
and
in
behalf
of
Emilia
,
whose
happiness
(
in
her
opinion
)
depend
upon
his
constancy
and
affection
;
and
she
would
have
question
him
more
minutely
about
the
state
of
his
affair
,
have
not
he
discourage
the
inquiry
,
by
seek
to
introduce
another
subject
of
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
after
mutual
protestation
of
friendship
and
regard
,
he
promise
to
visit
her
often
,
during
her
residence
in
town
;
and
take
his
leave
in
a
strange
perplexity
of
mind
,
occasion
by
the
image
of
love
,
intrude
upon
the
remonstrance
of
cark
care
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
time
ago
forsake
those
extravagant
companion
with
whom
he
have
riot
in
the
heyday
of
his
fortune
,
and
begin
to
consort
with
a
grave
and
more
sober
specie
of
acquaintance
:
but
he
now
find
himself
disabled
from
cultivate
the
society
of
these
also
,
who
be
man
of
ample
estate
and
liberal
disposition
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
their
party
be
too
expensive
for
the
consumptive
state
of
his
finance
;
so
that
he
be
oblige
to
descend
another
degree
,
and
mingle
with
a
set
of
old
batchelor
and
young
brother
,
who
subsist
on
slender
annuity
,
or
what
be
call
a
bare
competency
in
the
public
fund
.
    
<EOS>
this
association
be
compose
of
second

hand
politician
and
minor
critic
,
who
in
the
forenoon
saunter
in
the
Mall
,
or
lounge
at
shew
of
picture
,
appear
in
the
drawing

once
or
twice
a

dispute
in

with
an
air
of

frequent
the
pit
of
the
playhouse

and
once
in
a
month
spend
an
evening
with
some
note
actor
,
whose
remarkable
saying
they
repeat
for
the
entertainment
of
their
ordinary
friend

<EOS>
after
all
,
he
find
something
comfortable
enough
in
the
company
of
these
gentleman
,
who
never
interest
his
passion
to
any
violence
of
transport
,
nor
teaze
him
with
impertinent
curiosity
about
his
private
affair
:
for
though
many
of
them
have
maintain
a
very
long
,
close
,
and
friendly
correspondence
with
each
other
,
they
never
dreamt
of
inquire
into
particular
concern
;
and
if
one
of
the
two
who
be
most
intimately
connect
,
have
be
ask
how
the
other
make
shift
to
live
,
he
would
have
answer
,
with
great
truth
,
"
really
,
that
is
more
than
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
notwithstanding
this
phlegmatic
indifference
,
which
be
of
the
true
english
production
,
they
be
all
inoffensive
,
good
-
natured
people
,
who
love
a
joke
and
a
song
,
delighted
in
tell
a
merry
story
,
and
pride
themselves
in
the
art
of
catering
,
especially
in
the
article
of
fresh
venison
and
wild
fowl
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
be
not
receive
among
them
on
the
footing
of
a
common
member
,
who
make
interest
for
his
admission
;
he
be
court
as
a
person
of
superior
genius
and
importance
,
and
his
compliance
look
upon
as
an
honour
to
their
society
.
<EOS>
this
their
idea
of
his
preheminence
be
support
by
his
conversation
,
which
,
while
it
be
more
liberal
and
learn
than
that
to
which
they
have
be
accustom
,
be
tincture
with
an
assume
air
,
so
agreeably
diffuse
,
that
instead
of
produce
aversion
,
it
command
respect
.
    
<EOS>
They
not
only
appeal
to
him
,
in
all
doubt
relate
to
foreign
part
,
to
which
one
and
all
of
them
be
stranger
,
but
also
consult
his
knowledge
in
history
and
divinity
,
which
be
frequently
the
topic
of
their
debate
;
and
in
poetry
of
all
kind
,
he
decide
with
such
magisterial
authority
,
as
even
weigh
against
the
opinion
of
the
player
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
variety
of
character
he
have
see
and
observe
,
and
the
high
sphere
of
life
in
which
he
have
so
lately
move
,
furnish
him
with
a
thousand
entertaining
anecdote
;
and
when
he
become
a
little
familiarized
to
his
disappointment
,
so
that
his
natural
vivacity
begin
to
revive
,
he
flash
among
them
in
such
a
number
of
bright
sally
,
as
strike
them
with
admiration
,
and
constitute
himself
a
classic
in
wit
:
<EOS>
insomuch
that
they
begin
to
retail
his
remnant
,
and
even
invite
some
particular
friend
to
come
and
hear
him
hold
forth
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
player
,
who
have
for
many
year
strut
about
the
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
of
covent
-
garden
,
as
the
Grand
Turk
of
wit
and
humour
,
begin
to
find
his
admirer
melt
away
;
and
a
certain
petulant
physician
,
who
have
shine
at
almost
all
the
Port
-
club
in
that
end
of
the
town
,
be
actually
oblige
to
import
his
talent
into
the
city
,
where
he
have
now
happily
take
root
.
    
<EOS>
nor
be
this
success
to
be
wonder
at
,
if
we
consider
that
,
over
and
above
his
natural
genius
and
education
,
our
adventurer
still
have
the
opportunity
of
know
every
thing
which
happen
among
the
great
,
by
mean
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
with
whom
he
still
maintain
his
former
intimacy
,
though
it
be
now
checquere
with
many
occasional
tist
,
owe
to
the
sarcastic
remonstrance
of
the
misanthrope
,
who
disapprove
of
those
scheme
which
miscarry
with
Peregrine
,
and
now
take
unseasonable
method
of
value
himself
upon
his
own
foresight
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
be
between
while
like
a
raven
croak
presage
of
more
ill
luck
from
the
deceit
of
the
minister
,
the
dissimulation
of
his
patron
,
the
folly
of
the
projector
for
whom
he
be
bind
,
the
uncertainty
of
the
seas
,
and
the
villainy
of
those
with
whom
he
have
entrust
his
cash
:
for
Crabtree
see
and
consider
every
thing
through
a
perspective
of
spleen
,
that
always
reflect
the
bad
side
of
human
nature
.
    
<EOS>
for
these
reason
,
our
young
gentleman
begin
to
be
disgust
,
at
certain
interval
,
with
the
character
of
this
old
man
,
whom
he
now
think
a
morose
cynic
,
not
so
much
incense
against
the
folly
and
vice
of
mankind
,
as
delight
with
the
distress
of
his
fellow
creature
.
<EOS>
thus
he
put
the
most
unfavourable
construction
on
the
principle
of
his
friend
,
because
he
find
himself
justly
fall
under
the
lash
of
his
animadversion
.
<EOS>
this
self
-
accusation
very
often
dissolve
the
close
friendship
:
<EOS>
a
man
,
conscious
of
his
own
indiscretion
,
be
implacably
offend
at
the
rectitude
of
his
companion
's
conduct
,
which
he
consider
as
an
insult
upon
his
failing
,
never
to
be
forgive
,
even
though
he
have
not
taste
the
bitterness
of
reproof
,
which
no
sinner
can
commodiously
digest
.
<EOS>
the
friendship
,
therefore
,
subsist
between
Crabtree
and
Pickle
,
have
of
late
suffer
several
symptomatic
shock
that
seem
to
prognosticate
a
total
dissolution
;
a
great
deal
of
smart
dialogue
have
pass
in
their
private
conversation
,
and
the
senior
begin
to
repent
of
have
place
his
confidence
in
such
an
imprudent
,
headstrong
,
ungovernable
youth
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
in
such
paroxysm
of
displeasure
,
that
he
prophesy
misfortune
to
Peregrine
,
and
even
tell
him
one
morning
,
that
he
have
dream'd
<EOS>
of
the
shipwreck
of
the
two
East
-
Indiamen
on
board
of
which
he
have
hazard
his
money
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
no
other
than
a
false
vision
;
for
,
in
a
few
week
,
one
of
them
arrive
at
her
mooring
in
the
river
,
and
he
receive
a
thousand
,
in
lieu
of
eight
hundred
pound
which
he
have
lend
upon
bond
to
one
of
the
mate
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
be
inform
,
that
the
other
ship
,
in
which
he
be
concern
,
have
,
in
all
probability
,
lose
her
passage
for
the
season
,
by
be
unable
to
weather
the
Cape
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
concern
at
that
piece
of
news
,
know
,
that
the
longer
he
should
lie
out
of
his
money
,
he
would
have
the
more
interest
to
receive
;
and
find
his
present
difficulty
remove
by
this
supply
,
his
heart
begin
to
dilate
,
and
his
countenance
to
resume
its
former
alacrity
.
    
<EOS>
this
state
of
exultation
,
however
,
be
soon
interrupt
by
a
small
accident
,
which
he
could
not
foresee
:
<EOS>
he
be
visit
one
morning
by
the
person
who
have
lend
his
friend
a
thousand
pound
on
his
security
,
and
give
to
understand
,
that
the
borrower
have
abscond
,
in
consequence
of
a
disappointment
,
by
which
he
have
lose
the
whole
sum
,
and
all
hope
of
retrieve
it
;
so
that
our
hero
be
now
liable
for
the
debt
,
which
he
beseech
him
to
discharge
accord
to
the
bond
,
that
he
(
the
lender
)
may
not
suffer
by
his
humanity
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
easily
conceive
,
that
Peregrine
do
not
receive
this
intelligence
in
cold
blood
.
    
<EOS>
He
curse
his
own
imprudence
in
contract
such
engagement
with
an
adventurer
,
whom
he
do
not
sufficiently
know
,
exclaim
against
the
treachery
of
the
projector
;
and
have
for
some
time
indulge
his
resentment
in
threat
and
imprecation
,
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
scheme
which
have
miscarry
.
    
<EOS>
the
lender
,
who
have
inform
himself
of
the
whole
affair
,
gratify
his
curiosity
in
this
particular
,
by
tell
him
that
the
fugitive
have
be
cajole
by
a
certain
knight
of
the
post
,
who
undertake
to
manage
the
thousand
pound
in
such
a
manner
,
as
would
,
in
a
very
little
time
,
make
him
perfectly
independent
;
and
thus
he
delineate
the
plan
:
"
one
half
of
the
sum
(
say
he
)
shall
be
lay
out
in
jewel
,
which
I
will
pawn
to
certain
person
of
credit
and
fortune
,
who
lend
money
upon
such
pledge
at
an
exorbitant
interest
.
<EOS>
the
other
shall
be
keep
for
relieve
them
,
so
that
they
may
be
again
deposit
with
a
second
set
of
those
honourable
usurer
;
and
when
they
shall
have
be
circulate
in
this
manner
through
a
variety
of
hand
,
we
will
extort
money
from
each
of
the
pawn
-
broker
,
by
threaten
them
with
a
public
prosecution
,
for
exact
illegal
interest
;
and
I
know
that
they
will
bleed
freely
,
rather
than
be
expose
to
the
infamy
attend
such
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
the
scheme
be
feasible
,
and
though
not
very
honourable
,
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
needy
borrower
,
that
he
assent
to
the
proposal
;
and
,
by
our
hero
's
credit
,
the
money
be
raise
.
<EOS>
the
jewel
be
accordingly
purchase
,
pawn
,
relieve
,
and
re
-
pledge
by
the
agent
,
who
undertake
to
manage
the
whole
affair
;
and
so
judiciously
be
the
project
execute
,
that
he
could
have
easily
prove
each
lender
guilty
of
the
charge
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
far
successfully
transact
the
business
,
this
faithful
agent
visit
them
severally
on
his
own
account
,
to
give
them
intimation
,
that
his
employer
intend
to
sue
them
on
the
statute
of
usury
;
upon
which
,
every
one
,
for
himself
,
bribe
the
informer
to
withdraw
his
evidence
,
by
which
alone
he
could
be
convict
;
and
have
receive
these
gratification
,
he
have
think
proper
to
retreat
into
France
,
with
the
whole
booty
,
include
the
original
thousand
that
put
them
in
motion
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
decampment
,
the
borrower
have
withdraw
himself
;
so
that
the
lender
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
his
security
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
mortifying
account
to
our
young
gentleman
,
who
in
vain
remind
the
narrator
of
his
promise
,
import
,
that
he
would
not
demand
the
money
,
until
he
should
be
call
to
an
account
by
his
ward
;
and
observe
,
that
long
before
that
period
,
the
fugitive
may
appear
and
discharge
the
debt
.
<EOS>
but
the
other
be
deaf
to
these
remonstrance
;
alledge
,
that
his
promise
be
provisional
,
on
the
supposition
that
the
borrower
would
deal
candidly
and
fairly
;
that
he
have
forfeit
all
title
to
his
friendship
and
trust
,
by
the
scandalous
scheme
in
which
he
have
embark
;
and
that
his
treacherous
flight
from
his
security
be
no
proof
of
his
honesty
and
intend
return
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
a
warning
,
by
which
he
(
the
lender
)
be
teach
to
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
insist
upon
his
be
indemnify
immediately
,
on
pain
of
let
the
law
take
its
course
;
and
Peregrine
be
actually
oblige
to
part
with
the
whole
sum
he
have
so
lately
receive
.
<EOS>
but
this
payment
be
not
make
without
extreme
reluctance
,
indignation
,
and
denunciation
of
eternal
war
against
the
absconder
,
and
the
rigid
creditor
,
betwixt
whom
he
suspect
some
collusion
.

Chapter

Cadwallader
act
the
part
of
a
comforter
to
his
friend
;
and
be
in
his
turn
console
by
Peregrine
,
who
begin
to
find
himself
a
most
egregious
dupe
.
   
<EOS>
this
new
misfortune
,
which
he
justly
charge
to
the
account
of
his
own
folly
,
recall
his
chagrin
;
and
though
he
endeavour
with
all
his
might
to
conceal
the
affair
from
the
knowledge
of
Cadwallader
,
that
pry
observer
perceive
his
countenance
overcast
;
and
the
projector
's
sudden
disappearance
alarm
his
suspicion
,
he
manage
his
inquiry
with
so
much
art
,
that
in
a
few
day
he
make
himself
acquaint
with
every
particular
of
the
transaction
,
and
resolve
to
gratify
his
spleen
at
the
expence
of
the
impatient
dupe
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
take
an
opportunity
to
accost
him
with
a
very
serious
air
,
say
,
a
friend
of
his
have
immediate
occasion
for
a
thousand
pound
,
and
as
Peregrine
have
the
exact
sum
lie
by
him
,
he
would
take
it
as
a
great
favour
,
if
he
would
part
with
it
for
a
few
month
on
undoubted
security
.
<EOS>
have
Pickle
know
the
true
motive
of
this
demand
,
he
would
,
in
all
likelihood
,
have
make
a
very
disagreeable
answer
;
but
Crabtree
have
wrapt
himself
up
so
securely
in
the
dissimulation
of
his
feature
,
that
the
youth
could
not
possibly
penetrate
into
his
intention
;
and
in
the
most
gall
suspence
reply
,
that
the
money
be
otherwise
engage

<EOS>
the
misanthrope

this
irritation

assume
the
prerogative
of
a
friend
,
and
question
him
so
minutely
about
the
disposal
of
the
cash
,
that
after
numberless
evasion
,
which
cost
him
a
world
of
torture
to
invent
,
he
could
contain
his
vexation
no
longer
,
but
exclaim
in
a
rage
,
"
damn
your
impertinence
!

<EOS>
tis
go
to
the
devil

and
that
be
enough

<EOS>
"
thereafter
as
it
may
be
(
say
this
tormentor
,
with
a
most
provoking
indifference
of
aspect
)
I
should
be
glad
to
know
upon
what
footing
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
some
expectation
of
advantage
from
that
quarter

"
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
Sir
(
cry
the
impatient
youth
)
if
I
have
any
expectation
from
hell
,
I
would
make
interest
with
you
,
for
I
believe
from
my
soul
,
you
be
one
of
its
most
favour
minister
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
fling
out
of
the
room
,
leave
Cadwallader
very
well
satisfied
with
the
chastisement
he
have
bestow
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
have
cool
himself
with
a
solitary
walk
in
the
park
,
during
which
the
violence
of
his
choler
gradually
evaporate
,
and
his
reflection
be
call
to
a
serious
deliberation
upon
the
posture
of
his
affair
;
he
resolve
to
redouble
his
diligence
and
importunity
with
his
patron
and
the
minister
,
in
order
to
obtain
some
fine
-
cure
,
which
would
indemnify
him
for
the
damage
he
have
sustain
on
their
account
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
go
to
his
lordship
,
and
signify
his
demand
,
after
have
tell
him
,
that
he
have
suffer
several
fresh
loss
,
which
render
an
immediate
provision
of
that
sort
necessary
to
his
credit
and
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
His
noble
friend
commend
him
for
the
regard
he
manifest
for
his
own
interest
,
which
he
consider
as
a
proof
of
his
being
at
last
detach
from
the
careless
inadvertency
of
youth
;
he
approve
of
his
demand
,
which
,
he
assure
him
,
should
be
faithfully
transmit
to
the
minister
,
and
back
with
all
his
influence
;
and
encourage
his
hope
,
by
observe
,
that
some
profitable
place
be
at
that
time
vacant
,
and
,
so
far
as
he
know
,
unengage
.
    
<EOS>
this
conversation
help
to
restore
the
tranquillity
of
Pickle
's
breast
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
still
harbour
resentment
against
Cadwallader
,
on
account
of
the
last
insult
;
and
on
the
instant
he
form
a
plan
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
misanthrope
's
remittance
from
his
estate
in
the
country
,
have
be
of
late
very
scanty
,
in
consequence
of
repair
and
bankruptcy
among
his
tenant
:
so
that
,
in
spite
of
all
his
frugality
,
he
have
be
but
barely
able
to
maintain
his
credit
,
and
even
that
be
engage
on
the
strength
of
his
running
rent
.
<EOS>
be
therefore
intimately
acquaint
with
the
particular
of
his
fortune
,
he
write
a
letter
to
Crabtree
,
subscribe
with
the
name
of
his
principal
farmer
's
wife
,
import
,
that
her
husband
be
lately
dead
,
and
the
great
part
of
her
cattle
destroy
by
the
infectious
distemper
<EOS>
,
she
find
herself
utterly
incapable
of
pay
the
rent
which
be
due
,
or
even
of
keep
the
farm
,
unless
he
would
,
out
of
his
great
goodness
,
be
pleased
to
give
her
some
assistance
,
and
allow
her
to
sit
free
for
a
twelvemonth
to
come
.
<EOS>
this
intimation
he
find
mean
to
convey
by
post
from
a
market
-
town
adjoin
to
the
farm
,
direct
in
the
usual
stile
to
the
cynic
,
who
see
it
stamp
with
the
know
mark
,
could
not
possibly
suspect
any
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
Hackneyed
as
he
be
in
the
way
of
life
,
and
steel
with
his
boasted
stoicism
<EOS>
,
this
epistle
throw
him
into
such
an
agony
of
vexation
,
that
a
double
proportion
of
sowering
be
visible
in
his
aspect
,
when
he
be
visit
by
the
author
,
who
have
observe
and
follow
the
postman
at
a
proper
distance
,
introduce
a
conversation
upon
his
own
disappointment
,
in
which
,
among
other
circumstance
of
his
own
ill
-
luck
,
he
tell
him
,
that
his
patron
's
steward
have
desire
to
be
excuse
from
pay
the
last
quarter
of
his
interest
precisely
at
the
appoint
term
;
for
which
reason
,
he
should
be
utterly
void
of
cash
;
and
therefore
request
,
that
Crabtree
would
accommodate
him
with
an
hundred
piece
out
of
his
next
remittance
from
the
country
.
    
<EOS>
this
demand
gall
and
perplex
the
old
man
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
muscle
of
his
face
assume
a
contraction
most
peculiarly
virulent
,
and
exhibit
the
character
of
Diogenes
with
a
most
lively
expression
:
he
know
that
a
confession
of
his
true
situation
would
furnish
Pickle
with
an
opportunity
to
make
reprisal
upon
him
,
with
intolerable
triumph
;
and
that
,
by
a
downright
refusal
to
supply
his
want
,
he
would
for
ever
forfeit
his
friendship
and
esteem
,
and
may
provoke
him
to
take
ample
vengeance
for
his
sordid
behaviour
,
by
expose
him
,
in
his
native
colour
,
to
the
resentment
of
those
whom
he
have
so
long
deceive
.
<EOS>
these
consideration
keep
him
some
time
in
a
most
rancorous
state
of
suspence
,
which
Peregrine
affect
to
misinterpret
,
by
bid
him
freely
declare
his
suspicion
,
if
he
do
not
think
it
safe
to
comply
with
his
request
,
and
he
would
make
shift
elsewhere
.
    
<EOS>
this
seem
misconstruction
increase
the
torture
of
the
misanthrope
,
who

with
the
utmost
irritation
of

in
my
conduct

me
like

rascally
usurer

"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
very
gravely
reply
,
that
the
question
need
no

for
(
say
he

have
I
consider
you
as

all

you

will
you
pleasure
me

shall
I

Would
it

with

since

<EOS>
why
do
not
nature
clap
a

of
long
ear

a
tail
upon
me

that
I
may
be
a
real
ass

and
champ

on
some
common

independent

<EOS>
Would
I
be
a
worm
,
that
I
may
creep
into
the
earth
,
and
thatch
my
habitation
with
a
single
straw

rather
a
wasp

a
viper
,
that
I
may
make
the
rascally

my

why

I
talk

rascality

<EOS>
folly

give
me

so
he

I
will
put
him
in

anew

<EOS>
before

I

send

perhaps
I
may
purchase
another
for
myself

to

"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
have
peruse
the
billet
,
and
listen
to
this
ejaculation
,
reply
with
great
composure
,
that
he
be
ashamed
to
see
a
man
of
his
year
and
pretension
to
philosophy

so
ruffle
by
a
trifle

<EOS>
"
what
signify
all
the
boasted
hardship
you
have
overcome
(
say
he
)
and
the
shrewd
observation
you
pretend
to
have
make
on
human
nature

<EOS>
where
be
that
stoical
indifference
you
affirm
you
have
attain
,
if
such
a
paultry
disappointment
can
disturb
you
in
this
manner

<EOS>
what
be
the
loss
of
three
hundred
pound
,
compare
with
the
misfortune
which
I
myself
have
undergo
within
these
two
year
?
<EOS>
yet
you
will
take
upon
you
to
act
the
censor
,
and
inveigh
against
the
impatience
and
impetuosity
of
youth
,
as
if
you
yourself
have
gain
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
the
passion
of
the
heart

<EOS>
You
be
so
kind
as
to
insult
me
t'other
day
in
my
affliction
,
by
reproach
me
with
indiscretion
and
misconduct
;
suppose
I
be
now
to
retort
the
imputation
,
and
ask
how
a
man
of
your
profound
sagacity
could
leave
your
fortune
at
the
discretion
of
ignorant
peasant
?
<EOS>
how
could
you
be
so
blind
as
not
to
foresee
the
necessity
of
repair
,
together
with
the
danger
of
a
bankruptcy
,
murrain
,
or
thin
crop
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
convert
your
land
into
ready
money
,
and
(
as
you
have
no
connexion
in
life

purchase
an
annuity
,
on
which
you
may
have
live
at
your
ease

without
any
fear

<EOS>
can
not
you
,
from
the
whole

cull
one
apophthegm
to
console
you
in
this
trivial
mischance

rot
your

<EOS>
if
the
cancer

thus
torment
with
your

speak
infinitely
more
to
the
purpose

<EOS>
do
not
you
know

Mr
Wiseacre

that
my
case
do
not
fall
within
the
province

rack
by
the
gout

deprive
of
liberty

visit
with
the
death
of
a
dear
friend

may
have
contribute
to

consolation

pay

me
from

I

speak
 
pronounce

or
may
heaven
close
your
mouth
for
ever

"
    
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
comfortable
fruit
of
your
misanthropy
(
answer
the
youth
)
<EOS>
your
laudable
scheme
of
detach
yourself
from
the
bond
of
society
,
and
of
move
in
a
superior
sphere
of
your

<EOS>
have
not
you
be
so
peculiarly
sage

and
intent
upon
laugh
at
mankind

you
could
never
have
be
disconcert
by
such
a
pitiful
inconvenience

any

would
have
accommodate
you
with
the
sum
in

<EOS>
but
now
the

may
retort
the

you

upon
such

<EOS>
this
I
mention
by
way

upon
which
I
would
have
you
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
;
and
should
it
come
to
that
issue

I
will
use
my
whole
interest

to
bring
in
his
verdict
Lunacy

that
your

have
christian
burial

"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
withdraw
,
very
well
satisfied
with
the
revenge
he
have
take
,
which
operate
so
violently
upon
Crabtree
,
that
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
sole
consideration
mention
above
,
he
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
have
recourse
to
the
remedy
propose
.
<EOS>
but
his
unwillingness
to
oblige
and
entertain
his
fellow
-
creature
,
hinder
him
from
practise
that
expedient
,
till
,
by
course
of
post
,
he
be
happily
undeceived
with
regard
to
the
situation
of
his
affair
;
and
that
information
have
such
an
effect
upon
him
,
that
he
not
only
forgave
our
hero
for
the
stratagem
,
which
he
immediately
ascribe
to
the
right
author
,
but
also
make
him
a
tender
of
his
purse
:
so
that
matter
,
for
the
present
,
be
bring
to
an
amicable
accommodation
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Peregrine
never
slacken
in
his
attendance
upon
the
great
;
he
never
omit
to
appear
upon
every
levee
-
day
,
employ
his
industry
and
penetration
in
get
intelligence
of
post
that
be
unfilled
,
and
every
day
recommend
himself
to
the
good
office
of
his
patron
,
who
seem
to
espouse
his
interest
with
great
cordiality
:
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
always
too
late
in
his
application
,
or
the
place
he
demand
chance
to
be
out
of
the
minister
's
gift
.
    
<EOS>
these
intimation
,
tho
'
communicate
in
the
most
warm
profession
of
friendship
and
regard
,
give
great
umbrage
to
the
young
gentleman
,
who
consider
them
as
the
evasion
of
an
insincere
courti
,
and
loudly
complain
of
them
as
such
to
his
lordship
,
signify
,
at
the
same
time
,
an
intention
to
sell
his
mortgage
for
ready
money
,
which
he
would
expend
to
the
last
farthing
in
thwart
his
honour
,
in
the
very
first
election
he
should
patronize
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
never
want
a
proper
exhortation
upon
these
occasion
:
he
do
not
now
endeavour
to
pacify
him
with
assurance
of
the
minister
's
favour
,
because
he
perceive
that
these
medicine
have
,
by
repeat
use
,
lose
their
effect
upon
our
adventurer
,
whose
menace
he
now
combat
,
by
represent
that
the
minister
's
purse
be
heavy
than
that
of
Mr
Pickle
<EOS>
;
that
therefore
,
should
he
make
a
point
of
oppose
his
interest
,
the
youth
must
infallibly
fail
in
the
contest
:
in
which
case
he
would
find
himself
utterly
destitute
of
the
mean
of
subsistence
,
and
consequently
preclude
from
all
hope
of
provision
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
an
observation
,
the
truth
of
which
our
young
gentleman
could
not
pretend
to
doubt
,
tho
'
<EOS>
it
do
not
at
all
tend
to
the
vindication
of
his
honour
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
indeed
Pickle
begin
to
suspect
the
sincerity
of
his
own
patron
,
who
,
in
his
opinion
,
have
trifle
with
his
impatience
,
and
even
elude
,
by
sorry
excuse
,
his
desire
of
have
another
private
audience
of
the
first
mover
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
also
begin
to
be
less
accessible
than
usual
;
and
Peregrine
have
be
oblige
to
dun
the
steward
with
repeat
demand

before
he
could
finger
the
last
quarter
of
his
interest
.
    
<EOS>
alarm
by
these
consideration
,
he
go
and
consult
the
nobleman
whom
he
have
oblige
in
the
affair
of
his
son
;
and
have
the
mortification
to
hear
but
a
very
indifferent
character
of
the
person
in
whom
he
have
so
long
confide
.
<EOS>
this
new
adviser
,
who
(
though
a
courtier
)
be
a
rival
of
the
other
,
give
our
adventurer
to
understand
,
that
he
have
be
lean
upon
a
break
reed
;
that
his
professed
patron
be
a
man
of
a
shatter
fortune
and
decayed
interest
,
which
extend
no
farther
than
a
smile
and
a
whisper
;
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
should
have
be
proud
of
an
opportunity
to
use
his
influence
with
the
minister
in
behalf
of
Mr
Pickle
:
    
<EOS>
"
but
,
since
you
have
put
yourself
under
the
protection
of
another
peer
,
(
say
he
)
whose
connexion
interfere
with
mine
,
I
can
not
now
espouse
your
cause
,
without
incur
the
imputation
of
seduce
that
nobleman
's
adherent
;
a
charge
which
,
of
all
other
,
I
would
most
carefully
avoid
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
always
be
ready
to
assist
you
with
my
private
advice
,
as
a
speciman
of
which
,
I
now
counsel
you
to
insist
upon
have
another
interview
with
Sir
Steady
Steerwell
himself
,
that
you
may
in
person
explain
your
pretension
,
without
any
risque
of
be
misrepresent
;
and
endeavour
,
if
possible
,
to
draw
him
into
some
particular
promise
,
from
which
he
can
not
retract
,
with
any
regard
to
his
reputation
:
for
general
profession
be
a
necessary
armour
wear
by
all
minister
in
their
own
defence
,
against
the
importunity
of
those
whom
they
will
not
befriend
,
and
would
not
disoblige
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
advice
be
so
conformable
to
his
own
sentiment
,
that
our
adventurer
seize
the
first
opportunity
to
demand
an
hearing
;
and
plainly
tell
his
patron
,
that
if
he
could
not
be
indulge
with
that
favour
,
he
should
look
upon
his
lordship
's
influence
to
be
very
small
,
and
his
own
hope
to
be
altogether
desperate
;
in
which
case
,
he
be
resolve
to
dispose
of
the
mortgage
,
purchase
an
annuity
,
and
live
independant
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
C
   
<EOS>
if
the
young
gentleman
's
money
have
be
in
other
hand
,
perhaps
the
peer
would
have
be
at
very
little
pain
,
either
in
gratify
his
demand
,
or
oppose
his
revenge
;
but
he
know
that
a
sale
of
the
mortgage
could
not
be
effect
without
an
inquiry
,
to
which
he
do
not
wish
to
be
expose
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
employ
all
his
interest
in
procure
the
solicit
audience
;
which
be
grant
,
Peregrine
,
with
great
warmth
and
elocution
,
expatiate
upon
the
injury
his
fortune
have
suffer
in
the
affair
of
the
borough
,
for
which
he
have
stand
candidate
;
he
take
notice
of
the
disappointment
he
have
sustain
in
the
other
election
,
remind
him
of
the
promise
with
which
he
have
be
amuse
,
and
in
conclusion
,
desire
to
know
what
he
have
to
expect
from
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
the
minister
have
patiently
hear
him
to
an
end
,
reply
with
a
most
gracious
aspect
,
that
he
be
very
well
informed
of
his
merit
and
attachment
,
and
very
much
disposed
to
convince
him
of
the
regard
which
he
pay
to
both
;
that
till
of
late
,
he
do
not
know
the
nature
of
his
expectation
,
neither
have
he
the
power
of
create
post
for
those
whom
he
be
incline
to
serve
;
but
if
Mr
Pickle
would
chalk
out
any
feasible
method
,
by
which
he
could
manifest
his
sentiment
of
friendship
,
he
should
not
be
backward
in
execute
the
plan
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
lay
hold
on
this
declaration
,
mention
several
place
which
he
know
to
be
vacant
;
but
the
old
evasion
be
still
use
:
one
of
them
be
not
in
his
department
of
business
;
another
have
be
promise
to
the
third
-
son
of
a
certain
earl
,
before
the
death
of
the
last
possessor
;
and
a
third
be
incumbere
with
a
pension
that
eat
up
a
good
half
of
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
such
obstruction
be
start
to
all
his
proposal
,
as
he
could
not
possibly
surmount
;
though
he
plainly
perceive
,
they
be
no
other
than
specious
pretext
to
cover
the
mortifying
side
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
exasperate
,
therefore
,
at
this
lack
of
sincerity
and
gratitude
,
"
I
can
easily
foresee
,
(
say
he
)
that
such
difficulty
will
never
be
want
,
when
I
have
any
thing
to
ask
;
and
for
that
reason
,
will
save
myself
the
trouble
of
any
farth
application
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
withdraw
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
,
breathe
defiance
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
but
this
patron
,
who
do
not
think
proper
to
drive
him
to
extremity
,
find
mean
to
persuade
his
honour
,
to
do
something
for
the
pacification
of
the
young
man
's
choler
:
and
that
same
evening
our
adventurer
receive
a
message
from
his
lordship
,
desire
to
see
him
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
intimation
,
Pickle
go
to
his
house
,
and
appear
before
him
with
a
very
cloudy
aspect
,
which
signify
to
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
his
temper
be
at
present
too
much
gall
to
endure
reproof
;
and
therefore
the
sagacious
peer
forbore
take
him
to
task
for
his
behaviour
during
the
audience
he
have
obtain
;
but
give
him
to
understand
,
that
the
minister
,
in
consideration
of
his
service
,
have
send
him
a
bank
-
note
for
three
hundred
pound
,
with
a
promise
of
the
like
sum
yearly
,
until
he
could
be
otherwise
provide
for
.
<EOS>
this
declaration
in
some
measure
appease
the
youth
,
who
condescend
to
accept
the
present
;
and
next
levee
-
day
,
make
his
acknowledgment
to
the
donor
,
who
favour
him
with
a
smile
of
infinite
complacency
,
which
intirely
dissipate
all
the
remain
of
his
resentment
;
for
,
as
he
could
not
possibly
divine
the
true
cause
of
his
be
temporize
with
,
he
look
upon
his
condescension
as
an
undoubted
proof
of
Sir
Steady
's
sincerity
,
and
firmly
believe
,
that
he
would
settle
him
in
some
place
with
the
first
opportunity
,
rather
than
continue
to
pay
this
pension
out
of
his
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
this
prediction
would
have
be
verify
,
have
not
an
unforeseen
accident
in
a
moment
overwhelm
the
bark
of
his
interest
at
court
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
this
short
gleam
of
good
fortune
recall
the
idea
of
pride
and
ambition
,
which
he
have
formerly
cherish
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
be
again
lift
up
,
his
good
humour
retrieve
,
and
his
mien
re
-
exalt
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
begin
to
be
consider
as
a
rise
man
by
his
fellow
-
dependant
,
who
see
the
particular
notice
with
which
he
be
favour
at
the
public
levee
;
and
some
of
them
,
for
that
reason
,
be
at
pain
to
court
his
good
grace
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
shun
his
former
intimate
,
with
whom
a
good
part
of
his
fortune
have
be
spend
,
but
make
up
to
them
in
all
place
of
public
resort
,
with
the
same
ease
and
familiarity
as
he
have
be
use
to
express
,
and
even
reimbarke
in
some
of
their
excess
,
upon
the
strength
of
his
sanguine
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
<EOS>
and
he
renew
their
consultation
in
the
court
of
ridicule
;
and
diver
exploit
be
atchieve
,
to
the
confusion
of
those
who
have
sail
into
the
North
of
their
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
but
these
enjoyment
be
soon
interrupt
by
a
misfortune
equally
fatal
and
unexpected
:
his
noble
patron
be
seize
with
an
apoplectic
fit
,
from
which
he
be
recover
by
the
physician
,
that
they
may
dispatch
him
accord
to
rule
;
and
accordingly
,
in
two
month
after
they
be
call
,
he
go
the
way
of
all
flesh
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
very
much
afflict
at
this
event
,
not
only
on
account
of
his
friendship
for
the
deceased
,
to
whom
he
think
himself
under
many
and
great
obligation
,
but
also
,
because
he
fear
that
his
own
interest
would
suffer
a
severe
shock
,
by
the
removal
of
this
nobleman
,
whom
he
consider
as
its
chief
support
.
<EOS>
He
put
himself
therefore
in
mourning
,
out
of
regard
to
the
memory
of
his
depart
friend
,
and
exhibit
genuine
mark
of
sorrow
and
concern
;
though
he
have
,
in
reality
,
more
cause
to
grieve
than
he
as
yet
imagine
.
    
<EOS>
when
quarter
day
come
about
,
he
apply
to
the
steward
of
his
lordship
's
heir
for
the
interest
of
his
money
,
as
usual
;
and
the
reader
will
readily
own
he
have
some
reason
to
be
surprize
,
when
he
be
tell
he
have
no
claim
either
to
principal
or
interest
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
the
manager
talk
very
civilly
as
well
as
sensibly
on
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
"
Your
appearance
,
Sir
,
(
say
he
to
Pickle
)
screen
you
from
all
suspicion
of
an
intended
fraud
;
but
the
mortgage
upon
those
land
you
mention
,
be
grant
to
another
person
many
year
before
you
pretend
to
have
lend
that
sum
;
and
I
have
,
<EOS>
this
very
morning
,
pay
one
quarter
's
interest
,
as
appear
from
this
receipt
,
which
you
may
peruse
for
your
satisfaction
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
so
thunder
-
strike
at
this
information
,
which
strip
him
of
his
all
,
that
he
could
not
utter
one
word
;
a
circumstance
that
do
no
great
honour
to
his
character
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
steward
,
who
,
in
good
earnest
,
begin
to
entertain
some
doubt
of
his
integrity
:
for
,
among
the
paper
of
the
deceased
,
which
he
have
examine
,
there
be
no
writing
,
memorandum
,
or
receipt
,
relate
to
this
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
pause
of
stupefaction
,
Peregrine
recollect
himself
so
far
,
as
to
observe
,
that
either
he
be
egregiously
mistaken
,
or
the
predecessor
of
his
lord
the
great
villain
upon
earth
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
Mr
Whatdyecallum
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
that
your
bare
assertion
,
in
this
affair
,
will
by
no
means
induce
me
to
put
up
quietly
with
the
loss
of
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
have
thus
express
himself
,
he
retire
from
the
house
,
so
discontent
at
this
demur
,
that
he
scarce
know
whether
he
move
upon
his
head
or
heel
;
and
the
park
chancing
to
lie
in
his
way
<EOS>
,
he
saunter
about
,
give
vent
to
a
soliloquy
in
praise
of
his
depart
friend
,
the
burden
of
which
be
a
string
of
incoherent
curse
imprecate
upon
himself
;
till
his
transport
,
by
degree
,
give
way
to
his
reflection
,
he
deliberate
seriously
and
sorrowfully
upon
his
misfortune
,
and
resolve
to
consult
lawyer
,
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
but
,
first
of
all
,
he
propose
to
make
personal
application
to
the
heir
,
who
,
by
a
candid
representation
of
the
case
,
may
be
incline
to
do
him
justice
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
determination
,
he
next
morning
put
his
writing
in
his
pocket
,
and
go
in
a
chair
to
the
house
of
the
young
nobleman
,
to
whom
be
admit
by
virtue
of
his
appearance
,
and
a
small
gratification
to
the
porter
,
he
explain
the
whole
affair
,
corroborate
his
assertion
with
the
paper
which
he
produce
,
and
describe
the
disgrace
that
would
be
intaile
upon
the
memory
of
the
deceased
,
should
he
be
oblige
to
seek
redress
in
a
public
court
of
justice
.
    
<EOS>
the
executor
,
who
be
a
person
of
good
breeding
,
condole
him
upon
his
loss
with
great
good
nature
,
though
he
do
not
seem
much
surprize
at
his
account
of
the
matter
;
but
wish
,
that
since
the
fraud
must
have
be
commit
,
the
damage
have
fall
upon
the
first
mortgager
,
who
(
he
say
)
be
a
thievish
usurer
,
grow
rich
by
the
distress
of
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
our
hero
's
remonstrance
,
he
observe
,
that
he
do
not
look
upon
himself
as
oblige
to
pay
the
least
regard
to
the
character
of
his
predecessor
,
who
have
use
him
with
great
barbarity
and
injustice
,
not
only
in
exclude
him
from
his
countenance
and
assistance
,
but
also
in
prejudice
his
inheritance
,
as
much
as
lie
in
his
power
;
so
that
it
could
not
be
reasonably
expect
,
that
he
would
pay
ten
thousand
pound
of
his
debt
,
for
which
he
have
receive
no
value
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
spite
of
his
chagrin
,
could
not
help
own
within
himself
,
that
there
be
a
good
deal
of
reason
in
this
refusal
;
and
after
have
give
loose
to
his
indignation
,
in
the
most
violent
invective
against
the
defunct
,
take
his
leave
of
the
complaisant
heir
,
and
have
immediate
recourse
to
the
advice
of
counsel
,
who
assure
him
that
he
have
an
excellent
plea
,
and
be
accordingly
retain
in
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
measure
be
take
in
the
first
vigour
of
his
exertion
,
during
which
his
spirit
be
so
fluster
with
the
diversity
of
passion
produce
by
his
mischance
,
that
he
mistake
for
equanimity
that
which
be
no
other
than
intoxication
;
and
two
whole
day
elapse
,
before
he
arrive
at
a
due
sense
of
his
misfortune
.
<EOS>
then
indeed
he
undergo
a
woeful
self
-
examination
;
every
circumstance
of
the
inquiry
add
fresh
pang
to
his
reflection
;
and
the
result
of
the
whole
be
a
discovery
,
that
his
fortune
be
totally
consume
,
and
himself
reduce
to
a
state
of
the
most
deplorable
dependance
.
<EOS>
this
suggestion
alone
may
(
in
the
anguish
of
his
despondency
)
have
drive
him
to
some
desperate
course
,
have
not
it
be
in
some
measure
qualify
by
the
confidence
of
his
lawyer
,
and
the
assurance
of
the
minister
,
which
(
slender
as
the
world
hath
generally
find
them
)
be
the
only
bulwark
between
misery
and
him
.
    
<EOS>
the
mind
be
naturally
pliable
,
and
,
provide
it
have
the
least
hope
to
lean
upon
,
adapt
itself
wonderfully
to
the
emergency
of
fortune
,
especially
when
the
imagination
be
gay
and
luxuriant
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
with
our
adventurer
;
instead
of
indulge
the
melancholy
idea
which
his
loss
inspire
,
he
have
recourse
to
the
flattering
delusion
of
hope
,
soothe
himself
with
unsubstantial
plan
of
future
greatness
,
and
endeavour
to
cover
what
be
past
with
the
veil
of
oblivion
.
    
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
he
resolve
to
make
Crabtree
acquaint
with
his
misfortune
,
that
once
for
all
he
may
pass
the
ordeal
of
his
satire
,
without
subject
himself
to
a
long
series
of
sarcastic
hint
and
doubtful
allusion
,
which
he
could
not
endure

<EOS>
He
accordingly
take
the
first
opportunity
of
tell
him
,
that
he
be
absolutely
ruin
by
the
perfidy
of
his
patron
,
and
desire
that
he
would
not
aggravate
his
affliction
,
by
those
cynical
remark
which
be
peculiar
to
man
of
his
misanthropical
disposition

listen
to
this
declaration
with
internal
surprize
,
which
,
however
,
produce
no
alteration
in
his
countenance

and
,
after
some
pause
,
observe
,
that
our

have
no
reason
to
look
for
any
new
observation
from
him
upon
this
event
,
which
he
have
long
foresee
,
and
daily
expect
;
and
exhort
him
,
with
an
ironical
sneer
,
to
console
himself
with
the
promise
of
the
minister
,
who
would
doubtless
discharge
the
debt
of
his
deceased
bosom

Mr

in

<EOS>
though
his

he
manage
matter
so

as
that
the
work
be
universally
impute

who
be
not

disappointed

this

not

attract
the

also
rouse

from

honour
with

offer

a

<EOS>
the
person
employ
for

purpose
be
a
bard
who
have
formerly
taste
of
our
hero
's
bounty
,
use
all
his
eloquence
to
persuade
him
to
comply
with
the
advance
of

which
he
describe
in
such
a
manner
,
as
inflame
the
curiosity
of

,
who
dismiss
the
embassador

with
an
acknowledgement

the
great

confer

He
be

instruct

in
consequence
of

compose
an

recite
on

evening
of

<EOS>
He
understand
,
that
this
constitution
be
no
other
than
a
body
of
author
,
incorporate
by
mutual
consent
,
for
their
joint
advantage

satisfaction
,
oppose
to
another
assembly
of

their

enemy

<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
they
seek
to
strengthen
themselves
with
such
a
valuable
acquisition
as
our
hero
be
like
to
prove
.
<EOS>
the
college
consist
of
author
only
,
and
these
of
all
degree
in
point
of
reputation
,
from
the
fabricator
of
a
song
set
to
music
,
and
sing
at
Marybone
,
to
the
dramatic
bard
who
have
appear
in
buskin
upon
the
stage
:
nay
,
one
of
the
member
have
actually
finish
eight
book
of
an
epic
poem
,
for
the
publication
of
which
,
he
be
,
at
that
time
,
soliciting
subscription
.
    
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
that
such
a
congregation
of
the
son
of
Apollo
would
sit
a
whole
evening
with
order
and
decorum
,
unless
they
be
under
the
check
of
some
establish
authority
:
and
this
inconvenience
have
be
foresee
<EOS>
,
they
have
elect
a
president
,
vest
with
full
power
to
silence
any
member
or
member
,
that
should
attempt
to
disturb
the
harmony
and
subordination
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
the
sage
,
who
at
this
time
possess
the
chair
,
be
a
person
in
year
,
whose
countenance
be
a
lively
portraiture
of
that
rancorous
discontent
which
follow
repeat
damnation
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
extremely
unfortunate
in
his
theatrical
production
,
and
be
(
to
use
the
word
of
a
prophane
wag
,
who
assist
at
the
condemnation
of
his
last
play
)
by
this
time
damn'd
beyond
redemption
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
still
tarry
about
the
skirt
of
Parnassus
,
translate
some
of
the
classic
,
and
write
miscellany
;
and
,
by
dint
of
an
invincible
assurance
,
insolence
untame
,
the
most
undaunted
virulence
of
tongue
,
and
some
knowledge
of
life
,
he
make
shift
to
acquire
and
maintain
the
character
of
a
man
of
learning
and
wit
,
in
the
opinion
of
people
who
have
neither
;
that
is
,
thirty
-
nine
in
forty
of
those
with
whom
he
associate
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
even
look
upon
in
this
light
by
some
few
of
the
college
;
though
the
major
part
of
those
who
favour
his
election
,
be
such
as
dread
his
malice
,
respect
his
experience
and
seniority
,
or
hate
his
competitor
,
who
be
the
epic
poet
.
    
<EOS>
the
chief
end
of
this
society
(
as
I
have
already
hint
)
be
to
assist
and
support
each
other
in
their
production
,
which
they
mutually
recommend
to
sale
,
with
all
their
art
and
influence
,
not
only
in
private
conversation
,
but
also
in
occasional
epigram
,
criticism
,
and
advertisement
insert
in
the
public
paper
.
    
<EOS>
this
science
,
which
be
know
by
the
vulgar
appellation
of
puffing
,
they
carry
to
such
a
pitch
of
finesse
,
that
an
author
very
often
write
an
abusive
answer
to
his
own
performance
,
in
order
to
inflame
the
curiosity
of
the
town
,
by
which
it
have
be
overlook'd
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
general
unanimity
in
the
college
,
a
private
animosity
have
long
subsist
between
the
two
rival
I
have
mention
,
on
account
of
precedence
,
to
which
both
lay
claim
,
though
,
by
a
majority
of
vote
,
it
have
be
decide
in
favour
of
the
present
chairman
.
<EOS>
the
grudge
indeed
never
proceed
to
any
degree
of
outrage
or
defiance
,
but
manifest
itself
at
every
meeting
,
in
attempt
to
eclipse
each
other
in
smart
saying
and
pregnant
repartee
;
so
that
there
be
always
a
delicate
mess
of
this
kind
of
wit
serve
up
in
the
front
of
the
evening
,
for
the
entertainment
and
example
of
the
junior
member
,
who
never
fail
to
divide
upon
this
occasion
,
declare
themselves
for
one
or
other
of
the
combatant
,
whom
they
encourage
by
their
look
,
gesture
,
and
applause
,
accord
to
the
circumstance
of
the
dispute
.
    
<EOS>
this
honourable
consistory
be
hold
in
the
good
room
of
an
ale
-
house
,
which
afford
wine
,
punch
,
or
beer
,
suitable
to
the
purse
or
inclination
of
every
individual
,
who
separately
pay
for
his
own
choice
:
and
here
be
our
hero
introduce
,
in
the
midst
of
twenty
stranger
,
who
,
by
their
look
and
equipage
,
form
a
very
picturesque
variety
.
<EOS>
He
be
receive
with
a
most
gracious
solemnity
,
and
place
upon
the
right
hand
of
the
president
,
who
have
command
silence
,
recite
aloud
his
introductory
ode
,
which
meet
with
universal
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
then
be
tender
to
him
the
customary
oath
,
oblige
him
to
consult
the
honour
and
advantage
of
the
society
,
as
far
as
it
should
lie
in
his
power
,
in
every
station
of
life
:
and
this
be
take
,
his
temple
be
bind
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
,
which
be
keep
sacred
for
such
inauguration
.
    
<EOS>
when
these
rite
be
perform
with
all
due
ceremony
,
the
new
member
cast
his
eye
around
the
place
,
and
take
a
more
accurate
survey
of
his
brother
;
among
whom
he
observe
a
strange
collection
of
periwig
,
with
regard
to
the
colour
,
fashion
,
and
dimension
,
which
be
such
as
he
have
never
see
before
.
<EOS>
those
who
sit
on
each
side
,
nearest
the
president
,
be
generally
distinguish
by
venerable
tye
,
the
foretop
of
which
exhibit
a
surprising
diversity
;
some
of
them
rise
slant
backwards
,
like
the
glacis
of
a
fortification
;
some
be
elevate
in
two
distinct
eminence
,
like
the
hill
Helicon
and
Parnassus
;
and
other
be
curl
and
reflect
,
as
the
horn
of
Jupiter
Ammon
.
<EOS>
next
to
these
,
the
major
take
place
,
many
of
which
be
mere
succedanea
,
make
by
the
application
of
an
occasional
rise
to
the
tail
of
a
lank
bob
;
and
in
the
low
form
appear
masse
of
hair
,
which
would
admit
of
no
description
.
    
<EOS>
Their
cloath
be
tolerably
well
suited
to
the
furniture
of
their
head
,
the
apparel
of
the
upper
bench
be
decent
and
clean
,
while
that
of
the
second
class
be
thread
-
bare
and
soil
;
and
at
the
low
end
of
the
room
,
he
perceive
diver
effort
make
to
conceal
rent
breech
and
dirty
linen
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
could
distinguish
by
their
countenance
,
the
different
kind
of
poetry
in
which
they
exercise
the
muse
;
he
see
Tragedy
conspicuous
in
a
grave
solemnity
of
regard
,
Satire
lour
in
a
frown
of
envy
and
discontent
,
Elegy
whine
in
a
funeral
aspect
,
<EOS>
pastoral
doze
in
a
most
insipid
languor
of
face
<EOS>
,
Ode
-
write
delineate
in
a
distract
stare
,
and
Epigram
squint
with
a
pert
sneer
.
<EOS>
perhaps
our
hero
refine
too
much
in
his
penetration
,
when
he
affirm
,
that
over
and
above
these
discovery
,
he
could
plainly
perceive
the
state
of
every
one
's
finance
,
and
would
have
undertake
to
have
guess
each
particular
sum
,
without
vary
three
farthing
from
the
truth
.
    
<EOS>
the
conversation
,
instead
of
become
general
,
begin
to
fall
into
party
;
and
the
epic
poet
have
actually
attract
the
attention
of
a
private
committee
,
when
the
chairman
interpose
,
call
aloud
,
"
no
cabal
,
no
conspiracy
,
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
His
rival
,
think
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
some
reply
to
this
rebuke
,
answer
,
"
We
have
no
secret
;
he
that
hath
ear
,
let
him
hear
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
speak
as
an
intimation
to
the
company
,
whose
look
be
instantly
whet
with
the
expectation
of
their
ordinary
meal
:
but
the
president
seem
to
decline
the
contest
;
for
,
without
put
on
his
fighting
face
,
he
calmly
reply
,
that
he
have
see
Mr
Metaphor
tip
the
wink
,
and
whisper
to
one
of
his
confederate
;
and
thence
judge
,
that
there
be
something
mysterious
on
the
carpet
.
    
<EOS>
the
epic
poet
,
believe
his
antagonist
crestfallen
,
resolve
to
take
the
advantage
of
his
dejection
,
that
he
may
inhance
his
own
character
in
the
opinion
of
the
stranger
;
and
with
that
view
ask
,
with
an
air
of
exultation
,
if
a
man
may
not
be
allow
to
have
a
convulsion
in
his
eye
,
without
be
suspect
of
a
conspiracy
.
    
<EOS>
the
president
,
perceive
his
drift
,
and
pique
at
his
presumption
,
"
to
be
sure
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
a
man
of
a
weak
head
may
be
very
well
suppose
to
have
convulsion
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
repartee
produce
a
laugh
of
triumph
among
the
chairman
's
adherent
;
one
of
whom
observe
,
that
his
rival
have
get
a
smart
rap
on
the
pate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
(
reply
the
bard
)
in
that
respect
Mr
Chairman
have
the
advantage
of
me
.
<EOS>
have
my
head
be
fortify
with
a
horn
-
work
,
I
should
not
have
be
so
sensible
of
the
stroke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
retort
,
which
carry
a
severe
allusion
to
the
president
's
wife
,
light
up
the
countenance
of
the
aggressor
's
friend
,
which
have
begin
to
be
a
little
obumbrated
;
and
have
a
contrary
effect
upon
the
other
faction
,
till
their
chief
,
collect
all
his
capacity
,
return
the
salute
,
by
observe
,
that
there
be
no
occasion
for
an
horn
-
work
,
when
the
covered
way
be
not
worth
defend
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
reprizal
upon
Mr
Metaphor
's
yokefellow
,
who
be
by
no
mean
remarkable
for
her
beauty
,
could
not
fail
to
operate
upon
the
hearer
;
and
as
for
the
bard
himself
,
he
be
evidently
ruffle
by
the
reflection
;
to
which
,
however
,
he
,
without
hesitation
,
reply
,
"
egad
!
'
<EOS>
tis
my
opinion
,
that
if
your
cover
way
be
lay
open
,
few
people
would
venture
to
give
the
assault
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
unless
their
battery
be
more
effectual
than
the
fire
of
your
wit
,
"
(
say
the
president
.
)
<EOS>
"
as
for
that
matter
,
(
cry
the
other
with
precipitation
)
<EOS>
they
would
have
no
occasion
to
batter
in
breach
;
they
would
find
the
angle
of
the
la
pucelle
bastion
demolish
to
their
hand
:
<EOS>
he
he
!
"
<EOS>
"
but
I
believe
it
would

a

almost
bite
off

there
be
such
a
woeful
wreck
of
periwig
on

that
no

the
fray

however
,
cease
at
the
approach
of
those
who
interpose
;
part
of
the
combatant
be
tired
of
an
exercise
,
in
which
they
have
receive
nothing
but
hard
blow
;
part
of
them
be
intimidate
by
the
remonstrance
of
the
landlord

his
company

who
threaten

call
the
watch
;

a
very
few
be
ashamed
of
the
scandalous
dispute

which
they
be
detect

<EOS>
but
though
the
battle
be
end
,
it
be
impossible
,
for
that
evening
,
to
restore
harmony
and
good
order
to
the
society

which
break
up
,
after
the
president
have
pronounce
a
short
and
confused
apology
to
our
adventurer
,
for
the
indecent
uproar
which
have
unfortunately
happen
on
the
first
night
of
his
admission
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
,
Peregrine
deliberate
with
himself
,
whether
or
not
his
reputation
would
allow
him
to
appear
again
among
this
venerable
fraternity
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
know
some
of
them
to
be
man
of
real
genius
,
how
ridiculous
soever
their
carriage
may
be
modify
,
and
be
of
that
laugh
disposition
,
which
be
always
seek
food
for
mirth
,
as
horace
observe
of
Philippus
,
Risus

quaerit
;
    
he
resolve
to
frequent
the
college
,
notwithstanding
this
accident
,
which
happen
at
his
inauguration
;
be
thereto
,
moreover
,
induce
by
his
desire
of
know
the
private
history
of
the
stage
,
with
which
he
suppose
some
of
the
member
perfectly
well
acquaint
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
visit
,
before
the
next
meeting
,
by
his
introductor
,
who
assure
him
,
that
such
a
tumult
have
never
happen
since
the
institution
of
the
assembly
,
till
that
very
night
;
and
promise
,
that
for
the
future
,
he
should
have
no
cause
to
be
scandalize
at
their
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
persuade
by
these
motive
and
assurance
,
he
trust
himself
once
more
in
the
midst
of
their
community
,
and
every
thing
proceed
with
great
decorum
;
all
dispute
and
altercation
be
avoid
,
and
the
college
apply
itself
seriously
to
the
purpose
of
its
meeting
;
namely
,
to
hear
the
grievance
of
individual
,
and
assist
them
with
salutary
advice
.
<EOS>
the
first
person
that
crave
redress
,
be
a
noisy
North
Briton
,
who
complain
(
in
a
strange
dialect
)
that
he
have
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
season
,
present
a
comedy
to
the
manager
of
a
certain
theatre
,
who
,
after
it
have
lie
six
week
in
his
hand
,
return
it
to
the
author
,
affirm
there
be
neither
sense
nor
English
in
the
performance
.
    
<EOS>
the
president
,
(
who
,
by
the
bye
)
have
revise
the
piece
)
think
his
own
reputation
concern
,
declare
,
in
presence
of
the
whole
society
,
that
with
regard
to
sense
,
he
would
not
undertake
to
vindicate
the
production
;
but
,
in
point
of
language
,
no
fault
could
be
justly
lay
to
its
charge
:
"
the
case
,
however
,
be
very
plain
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
the
manager
never
give
himself
the
trouble
to
peruse
the
play
,
but
form
a
judgment
of
it
from
the
conversation
of
the
author
,
never
dream
that
it
have
undergo
the
revisal
of
an
english
writer
:
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
you
be
infinitely
oblige
to
him
,
for
have
dispatch
you
so
soon
,
and
I
shall
have
the
well
opinion
of
him
for
it
so
long
as
I
live
;
for
I
have
know
other
-
guess
author
than
you
(
that
is
,
in
point
of
interest
and
fame
)
keep
in
continual
attendance
and
dependance
during
the
good
part
of
their
life
,
and
after
all
,
disappoint
in
the
expectation
of
see
their
performance
exhibit
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
method
,
by
which
you
have
any
chance
of
introduce
your
play
upon
the
theatre
;
one
be
compulsive
,
by
the
interposition
of
the
great
,
whom
a
patentee
dare
not
disoblige
;
the
other
,
insinuation
,
by
ingratiate
yourself
with
the
manager
:
you
must
be
recommend
to
his
notice
;
you
must
cultivate
his
good
grace
with
all
the
humility
of
adulation
;
write
poem
in
his
praise
;
if
he
be
an
actor
,
support
his
performance
against
all
censure
,
though
it
should
be
found
upon
demonstration
;
and
in
public
coffee
-
house
,
as
well
as
in
private
party
,
magnify
the
virtue
of
his
heart
,
in
despite
of
truth
and
illustration
.
    
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
be
the
most
effectual
expedient
,
and
what
I
advise
you
to
practise
,
after
you
shall
have
be
introduce
to
his
acquaintance
,
by
some
person
of
weight
;
and
if
,
by
these
mean
,
and
dint
of
perseverance
,
you
can
,
in
three
or
four
year
,
see
your
comedy
in
rehearsal
,
you
may
think
yourself
extremely
fortunate
in
your
application
:
for
a
man
,
without
interest
or
pretension
,
may
present
a
petition
to
the
captain
-
general
of
his
majesty
's
force
,
demand
a
commission
for
the
first
company
that
shall
become
vacant
,
and
be
as
likely
to
meet
with
success
,
as
an
unsupported
author
that
offer
a
performance
to
the
stage
.
<EOS>
though
a
patentee
have
no
friend
of
his
own
to
oblige
,
why
the
devil
should
he
put
himself
to
the
expence
and
trouble
attend
the
representation
of
a
new
play
,
and
part
with
three
benefit
-
night
,
to
please
the
vanity
and
fill
the
pocket
of
a
stranger
?
"
    
<EOS>
the
northern
bard
begin
to
argue
with
great
vehemence
and
vociferation
,
against
the
advice
and
observation
of
the
chairman
,
undertake
to
prove
from
reason
,
as
well
as
from
experience
,
that
one
poet
be
of
great
dignity
and
importance
to
the
commonwealth
,
than
all
the
patentee
or
player
that
ever
exist
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
over
-
rule
and
silence
in
the
beginning
of
his
harangue
,
by
a
decree
of
the
council
,
which
be
unanimously
of
opinion
,
that
the
advice
he
have
receive
be
equally
judicious
and
expedient
,
and
that
it
would
be
his
own
fault
,
if
he
do
not
profit
by
the
admonition

Chapter
CII
further
proceeding
of
the
college
.
   
<EOS>
this
affair
be
no
sooner
discuss
,
than
another
gentleman
exhibit
a
complaint
,
signify
,
that
he
have
undertake
to
translate
into
English
,
a
certain
celebrated
author
,
who
have
be
cruelly
mangle
by
former
attempt
;
and
that
,
soon
as
his
design
take
air
,
the
proprietor
of
those
miserable
translation
have
endeavour
to
prejudice
his
work
,
by
industrious
insinuation
,
contrary
to
truth
and
fair
dealing
,
importing
,
that
he
do
not
understand
one
word
of
the
language
which
he
pretend
to
translate
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
case
that
nearly
concern
the
great
part
of
the
audience
,
it
be
take
into
serious
deliberation
:
some
observe
,
that
it
be
not
only
a
malicious
effort
against
the
plaintiff
,
but
also
a
spiteful
advertisement
to
the
public
,
tend
to
promote
an
inquiry
into
the
ability
of
all
other
translator
,
few
of
whom
(
it
be
well
know
)
be
so
qualified
,
as
to
stand
the
test
of
such
examination
.
<EOS>
other
say
,
that
over
and
above
this
consideration
,
which
ought
to
have
its
due
weight
with
the
college
,
there
be
a
necessity
for
concert
measure
to
humble
the
presumption
of
bookseller
,
who
have
,
from
time
immemorial
,
take
all
opportunity
to
oppress
and
enslave
their
author
;
not
only
by
limit
man
of
genius
to
the
wage
of
a
journeyman
taylor
,
without
even
allow
them
one
sabbath
in
the
week
,
but
also
in
take
such
advantage
of
their
necessity
,
as
be
inconsistent
with
justice
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
"
for
example
,
(
say
one
of
the
member
)
after
I
myself
have
acquire
a
little
reputation
with
the
town
,
I
be
caress
by
one
of
those
tyrant
who
profess
a
friendship
for
me
,
and
even
supply
me
with
money
,
accord
to
the
exigency
of
my
situation
;
so
that
I
look
upon
him
as
the
mirrour
of
disinterested
benevolence
;
and
have
he
know
my
disposition
,
and
treat
me
accordingly
,
I
should
have
writ
for
him
upon
his
own
term
.
<EOS>
after
have
use
his
friendship
in
this
manner
for
some
time
,
I
happen
to
have
occasion
for
a
small
sum
of
money
,
and
with
great
confidence
make
another
application
to
my
good
friend
;
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
put
a
stop
to
his
generosity
,
refuse
to
accommodate
me
in
the
most
abrupt
and
mortifying
style
;
and
though
I
be
at
that
time
pretty
far
advanced
in
a
work
for
his
benefit
,
which
be
a
sufficient
security
for
what
I
owe
him
,
he
roundly
ask
,
how
I
propose
to
pay
the
money
which
I
have
already
borrow
.
<EOS>
thus
be
I
use
like
a
young
whore
just
come
upon
the
town
,
whom
the
bawd
allow
to
run
into
her
debt
,
that
she
may
have
it
in
her
power
to
oppress
her
at
pleasure
;
and
if
the
sufferer
complain
,
she
be
treat
like
the
most
ungrateful
wretch
upon
earth
;
and
that
too
with
such
appearance
of
reason
,
as
may
easily
mislead
an
unconcerned
spectator
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
unthankful
drab
!
<EOS>
(
she
will
say
)
do
not
I
take
you
into
my
house
when
you
have
not
a
shift
to
your
back
,
a
petticoat
to
your
tail
,
nor
a
morsel
of
bread
to
put
into
your
belly
?
    
<EOS>
Ha'n't
<EOS>
I
cloathe
you
from
head
to
foot
like
a
gentlewoman
,
support
you
with
board
,
lodging
,
and
all
necessary
,
till
your
own
extravagance
hath
bring
you
into
distress

and
now
you
have
the
impudence
,
you
nasty
,
stink
brimstone
bungaway
!
<EOS>
to
say
you
be
hardly
deal
with
,
when
I
demand
no
more
than
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
thus
the
whore
and
the
author
be
equally
oppress
,
and
even
leave
without
the
melancholy
privilege
of
complain
;
so
that
they
be
fain
to
subscribe
to
such
term
as
their
creditor
shall
please
to
impose
.
    
<EOS>
this
illustration
operate
so
powerfully
upon
the
conviction
and
resentment
of
the
whole
college
,
that
revenge
be
universally
denounce
against
those
who
have
aggrieve
the
plaintiff
;
and
after
some
debate
,
it
be
agree
,
that
he
should
make
a
new
translation
of
some
other
saleable
book
,
in
opposition
to
a
former
version
belong
to
the
delinquent
,
and
print
it
in
such
a
small
size
,
as
would
enable
him
to
undersell
their
property
;
and
that
this
new
translation
should
be
recommend
and
introduce
into
the
world
,
with
the
whole
art
and
influence
of
the
society
.
    
<EOS>
this
affair
be
settle
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
present
,
an
author
of
some
character
stand
up
,
and
crave
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
fellow
,
in
punish
a
certain
nobleman
of
great
pretension
to
taste
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
a
production
which
this
gentleman
have
usher
into
the
world
,
with
universal
applause
,
not
only
desire
,
but
even
eagerly
court
his
acquaintance

<EOS>
He
invite
me
to
his
house
(
say
he
)
where
I
be
overwhelmed
with
civility
and
profession
of
friendship

<EOS>
He
insist
upon
my
treat
him
as
an
intimate

and
call
upon
him
at
all
hour
,
without
ceremony
;
he
make
me
promise
to
breakfast
with
him
at
least
three
time
a
week
:
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
look
upon
myself
as
very
fortunate
,
in
meeting
with
such
advance
from
a
man
of
his
interest
and
reputation
,
who
have
it
in
his
power
to
befriend
me
effectually
in
my
passage
through

that
I
may
not
give
him
any
cause
to
think
I
neglect
his
friendship
,
I
go
to
his
house
in
two
day
,
with
a
view
of
drink
chocolate
,
accord
to
appointment
:
but
he
have
be
so
much
fatigue
with
dancing
at
an
assembly
over
night
,
that
his
valet
de
chambre
would
not
venture
to
wake
him
so
early
;
and
I
leave
my
compliment
to
his
lordship
,
with
a
performance
in
manuscript
,
which
he
have
express
a
most
eager
desire
to
peruse
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
visit
next
morning
,
that
his
impatience
to
see
me
may
not
have
some
violent
effect
upon
his
constitution
;
and
receive
a
message
from
his
minister
,
signify
,
that
he
have
be
highly
entertain
with
the
manuscript
I
have
leave
,
a
great
part
of
which
he
have
read
,
but
be
at
present
so
busy
in
contrive
a
proper
dress
for
a
private
masquerade
,
which
would
be
give
that
same
evening
,
that
he
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
my
company
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
feasible
excuse
,
which
I
admit
accordingly
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
appear
again
,
when
his
lordship
be
particularly
engage
.
<EOS>
this
may
possibly
be
the
case
;
and
therefore
I
return
the
fourth
time
,
in
hope
of
find
him
more
at
leisure
;
but
he
have
go
out
about
half
an
hour
before
my
arrival
,
and
leave
my
performance
with
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
assure
me
,
that
his
lord
have
peruse
it
with
infinite
pleasure
.
<EOS>
perhaps
may
have
retire
very
well
satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
have
not
I
,
in
my
passage
through
the
hall
,
hear
one
of
the
footman
,
upon
the
top
of
the
stair
-
case
,
pronounce
with
an
audible
voice
,
"
Will
your
lordship
please
to
be
at
home
,
when
he
call
?
"
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
I
be
pleased
at
this
discovery
,
which
I
no
sooner
make
,
than
turn
to
my
conductor
,
"
I
find
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
his
lordship
be
dispose
to
be
abroad
to
more
people
than
me
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fellow
(
though
a
valet
de
chambre
)
blush
at
this
observation
;
and
I
withdraw
,
not
a
little
irritated
at
the
silly
peer
's
disingenuity
,
and
fully
resolve
to
spare
him
my
visit
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
this
occasion
,
that
I
happen
to
meet
him
in
the
park
,
and
be
naturally
civil
,
I
could
not
pass
him
without
a
salutation
of
the
hat
,
which
he
return
in
the
most
distant
manner
,
though
we
be
both
solitary
,
and
not
a
soul
within
view
;
and
when
that
very
performance
,
which
he
have
applaud
so
warmly
,
be
lately
publish
by
subscription
,
he
do
not
bespeak
so
much
as
one
copy
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
reflect
with
wonder
upon
this
ridiculous
inconsistency
in
the
man
's
conduct
,
which
look
like
the
result
of
a
settle
design
to
render
himself
odious
and
contemptible
.
<EOS>
I
never
court
his
patronage
,
nor
indeed
think
of
his
name
,
until
he
make
interest
for
my
acquaintance
;
and
if
he
be
disappointed
in
my
conversation
,
why
do
he
press
me
so
much
to
further
connexion
?
"
    
<EOS>
"
the
case
be
very
clear
,
(
cry
the
chairman
,
interrupt
him
)
<EOS>
he
be
one
of
those
coxcomb
who
set
up
for
taste
,
and
value
themselves
upon
know
all
man
of
genius
,
whom
they
would
be
think
to
assist
in
their
production
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
lay
an
even
bet
with
any
man
,
that
his
lordship
,
on
the
strength
of
that
slender
interview
,
together
with
the
opportunity
of
have
see
your
performance
in
manuscript
,
have
already
hint
to
every
company
in
which
he
be
conversant
,
that
you
solicit
his
assistance
in
retouch
the
piece
,
which
you
have
now
offer
to
the
publick
,
and
that
he
be
pleased
to
favour
you
with
his
advice
,
but
find
you
obstinately
bigotted
to
your
own
opinion
,
in
some
point
relate
to
those
very
passage
which
have
not
meet
with
the
approbation
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
his
caress
,
there
be
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
by
that
time
you
have
live
to
my
age
,
you
will
not
be
surprize
to
see
a
courtier
's
promise
and
performance
of
a
different
complexion
:
not
but
that
I
would
willingly
act
as
an
auxiliary
to
your
resentment
,
if
I
think
it
be
possible
to
make
him
repent
of
his
pitiful
dissimulation
;
but
,
if
I
guess
aright
,
the
person
you
mean
,
have
long
ago
conquer
all
sense
of
probity
and
shame
,
and
therefore
be
effectually
shield
against
the
revenge
of
an
author
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
opinion
of
the
president
be
sanction
by
the
concurrence
of
all
the
member
;
and
all
other
complaint
and
memorial
be
defer
till
another
sitting
,
the
college
proceed
to
an
exercise
of
wit
,
which
be
generally
perform
once
every
fortnight
,
with
a
view
to
promote
the
expectoration
of
genius

<EOS>
the
subject
be
occasionally
choose
by
the
chairman

who
open
the
game
with
some
shrewd
remark
naturally
arise
from
the
conversation
;

then
the
ball
be
toss
about
from

corner

the
motion

may
have
a

this
sport

of
the
ability

those
who
carry
it
on

,
I
shall
repeat
the
sally
of
this
evening
,
accord
to
the
order
and
succession
in
which
they
escape

<EOS>
one
of
the

observe
that
Mr
Metaphor

absent

be
tell
by
the
person
who
sit

"
    
<EOS>
a
third
mouth
be
just
open
,
when
the
exercise
be
suddenly
interrupt
by
the
dreadful
cry
of
fire
,
which
issue
from
the
kitchen
,
and
involve
the
whole
college
in
confusion

<EOS>
every
man
endeavour

this
communication
produce
noise
and
exclamation
;
cloud
of
smoke
roll
upwards
into
the
apartment

and
terror
sit
on
every
brow
;
when
Peregrine
see
no
prospect
of
retreat
by
the
door
,
open
one
of
the
window
,
and
fairly
leapt
into
the
street
,
where
he
find
a
crowd
of
people
assemble
to
contribute
their
assistance
in
extinguish
the
flame
.
<EOS>
several
member
of
the
college
follow
his
example
,
and
happily
accomplish
their
escape
:
the
chairman
himself
be
unwilling
to
use
the
same
expedient
,
stand
tremble
on
the
brink
of
descent
,
dubious
of
his
own
agility
,
and
dread
the
consequence
of
such
a
leap
,
when
a
chair
happen
to
pass
,
he
lay
hold
on
the
opportunity
,
and
by
an
exertion
of
his
muscle
pitch
upon
the
top
of
the
carriage
,
which

immediately
overturn
in
the
kennel

to
the
grievous
annoyance

in
the
terror
of
be
crush
to
piece

utter
a
scream
which
the
populace
suppose
to
proceed
from
the
mouth
of
a
woman

therefore
go
to
his
assistance

instead

recollect
themselves

affright

than
their
compassion

change

they
begin
to
pass
a
great
many
unsavoury
joke
upon
his
misfortune

which
they
now
discover
no
inclination

himself
very
uncomfortably
beset

his

prevail
upon

to
carry
him
into
the
house

an
apothecary

advantageous
accident

fright
operate
so
violently

that
he
be
seize
with
a
delirium

lie
a

deprive

neglect
in
point
of
medicine

royally
regale

Our

return
to

soon
yield

be
happily
overcome

without
any
other
bad
consequence

Eager

prison
of

Marshalsea

and
King

as
those
unhappy
author
expect
nothing
from
their
brother
but
advice
and
good
office
,
which
do
not
concern
the
purse
,
their
memorial
be
consider
with
great
care
and
humanity
;
and
,
upon
this
occasion
,
Peregrine
have
it
in
his
power
to
manifest
his
importance
to
the
community
;
for
he
happen
to
be
acquaint
with
the
creditor
of
one
of
the
prisoner
,
and
know
that
gentleman
's
severity
be
owe
to
his
resentment
at
the
behaviour
of
the
debtor
,
who
have
lampoon
him
in
print
,
because
he
refuse
to
comply
with
a
fresh
demand
,
after
he
have
lend
him
money
to
the
amount
of
a
considerable
sum
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
therefore
understand
that
the
author
be
penitent
,
and
dispose
to
make
a
reasonable
submission
,
promise
to
employ
his
influence
with
the
creditor
towards
an
accommodation
;
and
,
in
a
few
day
,
actually
obtain
his
release
.
    
<EOS>
these
social
duty
be
discharge
,
the
conversation
take
a
general
turn
,
and
several
new
production
be
freely
criticise
;
those
especially
which
belong
to
author
who
be
either
unconnected
with

or
unknown
to
the
college
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
profession
of
stage
-
play
escape
the
cognizance
of
the
assembly
:
a
deputation
of
the
most
judicious
member
be
send
weekly
to
each
theatre
,
with
a
view
of
make
remark
upon
the
performance
of
the
actor
.
<EOS>
the
two
censor
for
the
precede
week
be
accordingly
call
upon
to
give
in
their
report
;
and
the
play
which
they
have
review
be
the
Fair
Penitent
and
the
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
the
person
who
have
examine
the
former
of
these
tragedy
,
own
that
he
have
make
no
material
observation
upon
the
principal
performer
:
he
say
he
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
very
well
entertain
,
tho
'
he
have
,
at
first
,
mistaken
Lothario
,
by
his
dress
,
for
a
puppet
-
shew
man
,
hire
for
the
entertainment
of
the
guest
at
Calista
's
wedding
;
and
be
afterwards
a
little
surprised
at
his
unreasonable
demand
,
when
,
in
challenge
Horatio
to
single
combat
,
he
desire
such
an
unweildy
antagonist
to
meet
him
a
whole
mile
among
rock
;
an
expedition
which
could
not
be
perform
without
imminent
danger
of
broken
bone
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
imagine
that
this
remark
proceed
from
his
ignorance
of
the
play
,
observe
that
the
critick
may
possibly
be
mislead
by
the
word
of
the
defiance
,
which
run
thus
:
west
of
the
town
a
mile
,
among
the
rock
,
two
hour
ere
noon
to

morrow
<EOS>
I
expect
thee

"
Sir

I
be
not

I
should
have
place
my
observation
to
the
account

instead
of

who
make
a
full
stop
at
the
word
town

then
pronounce
 
a
mile
among
the
rock

without
the
least
pause
of
distinction

<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
in
the
research
of
his
great
penetration
,
he
may
have
discover
that
this
be
the
genuine
pointing
of
the
poet
,
and
that
Lothario
have
actually
a
design
upon
the
shin
of
Altamont
's
friend
:
in
which
case
he
be
to
be
commend
for
this
,
among
his
other
improvement
in
the
art
of
act
;
yet
I
can
not
approve
of
his
refinement
in
the
mystery
of
die
hard
;
his
fall
,
and
the
circumstance
of
his
death
,
in
the
character
of
this
gay
libertine
,
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
lively
representation
of
a
tinker
oppress
with
gin
,
who
stagger
against
a
post
,
tumble
into
the
kennel
,
while
his
hammer
and
saucepan
drop
from
his
hand
,
make
diver
convulsive
effort
to
rise
,
and
find
himself
unable
to
get
up
,
with
many
intervene
hiccup
,
address
himself
to
the
surround
mob

I
confess
(
replied
Pickle
)
<EOS>
the
action
of
that
same
player
be
not
free
from
unnatural
violence
and
ridiculous
gesticulation
:
a
kind
of
false
fire
in
which
he
find
his
account
with
the
audience
,
who
never
fail
to
honour
it
with
particular
mark
of
applause
;
but
I
think
the
simile
of
the
tinker
be
too
severe
,
and
rather
one
of
those
grotesque
comparison
which
may
subject
the
most
grave
and
solemn
incident
to
ridicule
,
than
a
fair
and
candid
illustration
of
the
fact
:
as
for
the
perversion
of
the
author
's
sense
,
by
an
impropriety
in
the
declamation
,
it
so
commonly
occur
,
even
in
the
most
celebrated
actor
,
that
one
would
think
it
be
an
obstacle
not
to
be
surmount
:
the
delightful
lullaby
of
the
stage
be
an
establish
recitative
,
which
seem
to
have
be
compose
on
the
supposition
that
the
sentence
be
always
conclude
at
the
end
of
the
line
;
and
when
the
last
word
happen
to
begin
a
new
period
,
the
sense
of
the
whole
must
suffer
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
the
Aesopus
of
the
age
,
who
value
himself
upon
accurate
speak
,
commit
innumerable
blunder
of
this
kind
,
one
of
which
I
,
at
present
,
recollect
,
in
a
passage
of
a
late
play
,
which
he
repeat
in
this
manner
:
to
beg
protection
for
the
man
who
lie
,
 
tremble
behind
their
rampart
.
    
<EOS>
thus
he
bring
the
poor
Romans
under
the
imputation
of
falshood
as
well
as
fear
;
for
,
accord
to
his
pause
,
they
tell
lie
,
as
well
as
tremble
behind
their
rampart
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
these
be
no
other
than
petty
oversight
:
(
say
the
second
censor
)
<EOS>
that
gentleman
(
take
him
all
in
all
)
be
certainly
the
most
compleat
and
unblemished
performer
that
ever
appear
on
our
stage
,
notwithstanding
the
blind
adoration
which
be
pay
to
his
rival
.
<EOS>
I
go
two
night
ago
,
with
an
express
design
to
criticize
his
action
:
I
could
find
no
room
for
censure
,
but
infinite
subject
for
admiration
and
applause
.
<EOS>
in
Pierre
he
be
great
,
in
Othello
excellent
,
but
in
Zanga
beyond
all
imitation
.
<EOS>
over
and
above
the
distinctness
of
pronunciation
,
the
dignity
of
attitude
and
expression
of
face
,
his
gesture
be
so
just
and
significant
,
that
a
man
,
tho
'
utterly
bereft
of
the
sense
of
hearing
,
may
,
by
see
him
only
,
understand
the
meaning
of
every
word
he
speak
!
<EOS>
sure
nothing
can
be
more
exquisite
than
his
manner
of
tell
Isabella
how
Alonzo
behave
when
he
find
the
incendiary
letter
which
she
have
dropt
by
the
Moor
's
direction
;
and
when
,
to
crown
his
vengeance
,
he
discover
himself
to
be
the
contriver
of
all
the
mischief
that
have
happen
,
he
manifest
a
perfect

the
critick

I
fancy
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
your
praise
must
be
ironical
,
because
,
in
the
very
two
situation
you
mention
,
I
think
I
have
see
that
player
out
-
herod
Herod
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
exceed
all
his
other
extravagance
.
    
<EOS>
the
intention
of
the
author
be
,
that
the
Moor
should
communicate
to
his
confidante
a
piece
of
information
contain
in
a
few
line
,
which
,
doubtless
,
ought
to
be
repeat
with
an
air
of
eagerness
and
satisfaction
,
not
with
the
ridiculous
grimace
of
a
monkey
,
to
which
,
methought
,
his
action
bear
an
intimate
resemblance
,
in
utter
this
plain
sentence
:
  
he
take
it
up
;
but
scarce
be
it
unfold
to
his
sight
,
when
he
,
as
if
an
arrow
pierc'd
his
eye
,
start
,
and
tremble
dropt
it
on
the
ground
.
    
<EOS>
in
pronounce
the
first
two
word
,
this
egregious
actor
stoop
down
,
and
seem
to
take
up
something
from
the
stage
,
then
proceed
to
repeat
what
follow
,
mimick
the
manner
of
unfold
a
letter
;
when
he
mention
the
simile
of
an
arrow
pierce
the
eye
,
he
dart
his
forefinger
towards
that
organ
,
then
recoil
with
great
violence
when
the
word
start
be
express
;
and
when
he
come
to
tremble
dropt
it
on
the
ground
,
he
throw
all
his
limb
into
a
tremulous
motion
,
and
shake
the
imaginary
paper
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
the
description
be
carry
on
with
the
same
minute
gesticulation
,
while
he
say
,
Pale
and
aghast
a
while
my
victim
stand
,
disguise
a
sigh
or
two
,
and
puff'd
them
from
him
;
then
rubb'd
<EOS>
his
brow
,
and
take
it
up
again
.
    
<EOS>
the
player
's
countenance
assume
a
wild
stare
,
he
sigh
twice
most
piteously
,
as
if
he
be
on
the
point
of
suffocation
,
scrub
his
forehead
,
and
bend
his
body
,
ape
the
action
of
snatch
an
object
from
the
floor
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
dexterity
of
dumb
shew
omit
,
when
he
conclude
his
intimation
in
these
three
line
:
    
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
look'd
<EOS>
as
if
he
mean
to
read
it
;
but
,
check'd
by
rise
fear
,
he
crush'd
it
thus
,
and
thrust
it
,
like
an
adder
,
in
his
bosom
.
    
<EOS>
here
the
judicious
performer
imitate
the
confusion
and
concern
of
Alonzo
,
seem
to
cast
his
eye
upon
something
,
from
which
they
be
immediately
withdraw
,
with
horror
and
precipitation
,
then
shut
his
fist
with
a
violent
squeeze
,
as
if
he
intend
to
make
immediate
application
to
Isabella
's
nose
,
he
ram
it
in
his
own
bosom
,
with
all
the
horror
and
agitation
of
a
thief
take
in
the
manner
.
<EOS>
be
the
player
debar
the
use
of
speech
,
and
oblige
to
act
to
the
eye
only
of
the
audience
,
this
mimickry
may
be
a
necessary
conveyance
of
his
meaning
;
but
when
he
be
at
liberty
to
signify
his
idea
by
language
,
nothing
can
be
more
trivial
,
force
,
unnatural
and
antick
,
than
this
superfluous
mummery
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
would
exclude
from
the
representation
the
grace
of
action
,
without
which
the
choice
sentiment
,
cloathe
in
the
most
exquisite
expression
,
would
appear
unanimated
and
insipid
;
but
these
be
as
different
from
this
ridiculous
burlesque
,
as
be
the
demeanor
of
a
Tully
in
the
rostrum
,
from
the
trick
of
a
Jack
-
pudde
on
a
mountebank
's
stage
and
for
the
truth
of
what
I
alledge
,
I
appeal
to
the
observation
of
any
person
who
have
consider
the
elegance
of
attitude
and
propriety
of
gesture
,
as
they
be
universally
acknowledge
in
the
real
character
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
know
as
Gascon
,
whose
limb
be
as
eloquent
as
his
tongue
he
never
mention
the
word
sleep
without
recline
his
head
upon
his
hand
;
when
he
have
occasion
to
talk
of
an
horse
,
he
always
start
up
and
trot
across
the
room
,
except
when
he
be
so
situated
that
he
could
not
stir
without
incommode
the
company
,
and
in
that
case
he
content
himself
with
neigh
aloud
:
if
a
dog
happen
to
be
the
subject
of
his
conversation
,
he
wag
his
tail
,
and
grin
in
a
most
significant
manner
;
and
one
day
he
express
his
desire
of
go
backwards
with
such
natural
imitation
of
his
purpose
,
that
every
body
in
the
room
firmly
believe
he
have
actually
overshoot
himself
,
and
fortify
their
nostril
accordingly
.
<EOS>
yet
no
man
ever
look
upon
this
virtuoso
to
be
the
standard
of
propriety
in
point
of
speak
and
deportment
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
confess
the
player
in
question
<EOS>
would
,
by
dint
of
these
qualification
,
make
a
very
good
figure
in
the
character
of
Pantaloon
's
lacquey
,
in
the
entertainment
of
Perseus
and
Andromeda
,
and
perhaps
may
acquire
some
reputation
,
by
turn
the
revenge
into
a
pantomime
;
in
which
cause
,
I
would
advise
him
to
come
upon
the
stage
,
provide
with
an
handful
of
flour
,
in
order
to
besmear
his
face
,
when
he
pronounce
pale
and
aghast
,
&
c.
and
methinks
<EOS>
he
ought
to
illustrate
the
adder
with
an
hideous
hiss
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
now
come
to
the
other
situation
,
in
which
this
modern
Aesopus
be
suppose
to
distinguish
himself
so
much
,
I
mean
that
same
eclaircissement
comprehend
in
Know
<EOS>
then
'
twas
 
I.
    
<EOS>
His
manner
,
I
own
,
may
be
alter
since
I
be
present
at
the
representation
of
that
performance
;
but
certain
I
be
,
when
I
beheld
him
in
that
critical
conjuncture
,
his
behaviour
appear
to
me
so
uncouth
,
<EOS>
that
I
really
imagine
he
be
visit
by
some
epileptic
distemper
;
for
he
stand
totter
and
gasp
for
the
space
of
two
minute
,
like
a
man
suddenly
strike
with
the
palsy
;
and
after
various
distorsion
and
side
-
shaking
,
as
if
he
have
get
flea
in
his
doublet
,
heave
up
from
his
lung
the
letter
<EOS>
I
,
like
a
huge
anchor
from
foul
ground
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
criticism
be
acceptable
to
the
majority
of
the
college
,
who
have
no
great
veneration
for
the
player
in
question
;
and
his
admirer
,
without
make
any
reply
,
ask
in
a
whisper
,
of
the
gentleman
who
sit
next
to
him
,
if
Pickle
have
not
offer
some
production
to
the
stage
,
and
meet
with
a
repulse
.
<EOS>
this
question
be
not
convey
so
softly
,
but
that
it
reach
the
ear
of
our
adventurer
,
who
seem
disposed
to
make
some
answer
,
when
he
be
prevent
by
the
interposition
of
another
member
,
who
beg
the
opinion
and
advice
of
the
community
,
touch
a
pastoral
which
he
have
just
compose
.
<EOS>
before
he
have
time
to
produce
the
performance
to
the
inspection
of
the
society
,
the
chairman
observe
,
with
a
splenetic
air
,
that
he
ought
to
have
employ
his
time
in
some
more
profitable
amusement
,
than
a
species
of
writing
in
which
he
have
formerly
meet
with
so
little
success
.

"
true
it
be
(
reply
the
author
)
<EOS>
my
last
production
of
this
kind

not
very
favourably

;
a
circumstance
intirely
owe
to
the
nature
of
the
subject

do
not
at
all

passion

the
heart

but
here
,
my
dear
Sir
,
the
case
be
otherwise

this
pastoral
I
compose
upon
the
death
of
my
own
grandmother
,
who
be
a
woman
,
in
all
respect
,
worthy
of
the
tear
I
have
shed
over
her
tomb
;
and
this
small
composition
be
the
genuine
offspring
of
unfeigned
sorrow

the
blot
which
be
still
visible
on
the
paper

indicate
the
grief
with
which
I
write
it

an
unmoistened
eye

wish
you
would

the
affliction

it
rehears'd

all
of

real

without
the
sobs
and
tear
of
the
author
,
who
look
wishfully
around
him
for
applause
,
and
have
wipe
his
eye
,
ask
the
chairman
's
opinion
of
what
he
have
read
.
<EOS>
that
cynical
gentleman
,
who
have
no
great
devotion
for
the
arcadian
,
answer
with
a
most
equivocal
aspect
,
"
sad
,
very
sad
!
<EOS>
sad
enough
to
draw
tear
from
the
eye
of
a
bumbailiff
.
<EOS>
"
but
as
the
performance
be
submit
to
the
criticism
of
the
whole
society
,
the
epic
poet
stand
up
,
and
thus
communicate
his
sentiment
.
    
<EOS>
"
without
enter
upon
a
minute
inquiry
into
the
poetical
merit
of
particular
image
,
I
must
in
general
observe
,
that
the
stanza
be
so
irregular
in
point
of
measure
,
as
well
as
in
the
number
of
the
line
,
that
they
can
not
be
comprehend
under
any
specie
of
the
ancient
versification
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
many
dark
allusion
in
the
Antistrophe
,
which
no
reader
can
possibly
understand
,
together
with
a
catalogue
of
the
name
of
place
,
for
which
the
author
seem
to
have
ramble
strangely
from
his
subject
,
more
studious
of
make
a
silly
parade
of
his
skill
in
poetical
geography
,
than
of
interest
the
passion
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
one
would
be
apt
to
conclude
from
this
circumstance
,
that
his
grief
be
mere
affectation
,
do
not
he
blubber
<EOS>
so
piteously
in
the
last
verse
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish
,
that
more
dignity
have
be
preserve
in
the
stanza
which
describe
the
old
gentlewoman
's
benevolence
,
and
that
the
last
line
have
be
altogether
omit
,
because
it
conjure
up
a
most
ridiculous
image
of
her
have
actually
hatch
that
same
poultry
,
which
she
be
say
to
have
tend
with
such
maternal
care
.
"
    
<EOS>
to
these
animadversion
the
censure
bard
reply
,
that
the
verse
,
in
be
irregular
,
the
more
nearly
resemble
the
natural
exclamation
of
real
affliction
,
and
that
such
irregularity
have
not
only
be
excuse
,
but
even
consider
as
a
beauty
in
many
modern
production
.
<EOS>
He
own
,
that
the
allusion
may
be
obscure
to
some
reader
,
and
therefore
he
intend
to
explain
them
in
note
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
topical
description
which
the
critic
have
censure
so
severely
,
he
say
they
be
insert
to
amuse
and
relieve
the
imagination
of
the
reader
,
that
he
may
not
be
too
much
affect
with
the
Pathos
of
the
subject
;
and
with
regard
to
the
line
,
    
<EOS>
as
if
she
common
mother
be
of
all
,
    
far
from
carry
that
ludicrous
implication
he
have
mention
,
it
certainly
convey
the
most
amiable
and
parental
idea
of
the
deceased
;
and
he
do
not
doubt
,
that
he
should
find
his
own
opinion
confirm
by
that
of
the
public
,
in
a
very
comfortable
sale
of
the
work

so
,
after

filial
tenderness

the

the

have
some

seem
to
disconcert
the

interpose

<EOS>
you

the
famous
Gosling

son

heir
of
Sir
Marmaduke
Scrag

who
seat
himself
in

chair

I
should

upon

pretension

<EOS>
do
a

flimsy

barren

him

trite
invective

with
the
most
ridiculous
gesture

before

<EOS>
for
my

I
never

I

yet
this
antick
piece
of

will
decide
dogmatically
upon
the
merit
of
every
new
work
;
and
if
the
author
have
not
previously
scratch
himself
into
his
favour
,
will
pronounce
upon
it
,
with
all
the
insolence
and
contempt
of
supercilious
presumption

<EOS>
nor
be
the
levity
of
his
head
less
provoking
than
his
arrogance
and
self

conceit
;
the
very
performance
which
he
yesterday
applaud

will
he

condemn
through

<EOS>
"
one
would
imagine
,
(
say
the

that

make
an

,
notwithstanding

I
do

that
Gosling

be
at
this

the
good
milch

cow
that
any

ever
stroake
:
for
,
over

above
his
vanity

which
lay
him
open

the
necessity

all
writer

can
tickle

though
never
so
awkwardly

he
possess
such
a
comfortable

simplicity

or
rather
lack
of
penetration

as
can
not
fail
to
turn
to
account
with
those
who
practise
upon
it

<EOS>
let
a
scribbler
(
for
example

creep
into
his
notice
by
the
most
abject
veneration
,
implore
his
judgment
upon
some
performance

assume
a
look
of
awful
admiration
at
his
remark

receive
and
read
his
emendation

pretend
extasy

exert
himself
officiously
about
his

make
interest

be
employ
in

bawl
for
him
upon

of
this
great
man

with
an
apparent
sense

nothingness

when

open
his

listen
with
a
foolish
face
of
praise

happy

<EOS>
if
he
have
an
opportunity
to
feed
him
with
the
soft
pap
of
dedication
,
or
by
affect
an
idiotical
ignorance
of
the
manner
of
life
,
to
insinuate
himself
into
his
opinion

as
a

absolutely
detach
from
all

it

will

ample

reversion

I
advise
Mr
Spondy
to
give
him
the
refusal
of
this

pastoral
:
who
know

he
may
have
the
good
fortune
of
be
list
in
the
number
of
his
beef

eater
;
in
which
case
he
may
,
in

be
provide
for

the
custom

church

when
he
be
inclined
to
marry
his
own
cook

wench
,

gracious
patron
may
condescend
to
give
the
bride
away
;
and
finally
settle
him
in
his

as

justice

<EOS>
Mr
Spondy
thank
the

counsel

not

CIII

the
young
gentleman
be
introduce
to
a
virtuoso
of
the
first
order
,
and
commence
Yelper
.
   
<EOS>
Hitherto
Peregrine
have
profess
himself
an
author
,
without
reap
the
fruit
of
that
occupation
,
except
the
little
fame
he
have
acquire
by
his
late
satire
;
but
now
he
think
it
high
time
to
weigh
solid
pudding
against
empty
praise
;
and
therefore
engage
with
some
bookseller
in
a
certain
translation
,
which
he
oblige
himself
to
perform
for
the
consideration
of
two
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
the
article
of
agreement
be
draw
,
he
begin
his
task
with
great
eagerness
,
rise
early
in
the
morning
to
his
work
,
at
which
he
labour
all
day
long
,
go
abroad
with
the
bat
in
the
evening
,
and
appear
in
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
amuse
himself
with
the
news
-
paper
and
conversation
till
nine
o'clock
;
then
he
retire
to
his
own
apartment
,
and
after
a
slight
repast
,
betook
himself
to
rest
,
that
he
may
be
able
to
unroost
with
the
cock
.
<EOS>
this
sudden
change
from
his
former
way
of
life
agree
so
ill
with
his
disposition
,
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
be
trouble
with
flatulency
and
indigestion
,
which
produce
anxiety
and
dejection
of
spirit
,
and
the
nature
of
his
situation
begin
in
some
measure
to
discompose
his
brain
;
a
discovery
which
he
no
sooner
make
,
than
he
have
recourse
to
the
advice
of
a
young
physician
,
who
be
a
member
of
the
college
,
and
at
this
time
one
of
our
hero
's
most
intimate
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
this
son
of
Aesculapius
have
consider
his
case
,
impute
his
disorder
to
the
right
cause
,
namely
,
want
of
exercise
;
dissuade
him
from
such
close
application
to
study
,
until
he
should
be
gradually
familiarize
to
a
sedentary
life
,
advise
him
to
enjoy
his
friend
and
his
bottle
in
moderation
,
and
wean
himself
from
his
former
custom
by
degree
;
and
,
above
all
thing
,
to
rise
immediately
after
his
first
sleep
,
and
exercise
himself
in
a
morning
-
walk
.
    
<EOS>
in
order
to
render
this
last
part
of
the
prescription
the
more
palatable
,
the
doctor
promise
to
attend
him
in
these
early
excursion
,
and
even
to
introduce
him
to
a
certain
personage
of
note
,
who
give
a
sort
of
public
breakfast
to
the
minor
virtuosi
of
the
age
,
and
often
employ
his
interest
in
behalf
of
those
who
properly
cultivate
his
countenance
and
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
extremely
acceptable
to
our
young
gentleman
,
who
,
besides
the
advantage
which
may
accrue
to
him
from
such
a
valuable
connexion
,
foresaw
much
entertainment
and
satisfaction
in
the
discourse
of
so
many
learned
guest
.
<EOS>
the
occasion
of
his
health
and
interest
,
moreover
,
coincide
in
another
circumstance
,
the
minister
's
levee
being
keep
betime
in
the
morning
;
so
that
he
could
perform
his
walk
,
yield
his
attendance
,
and
breakfast
at
this
philosophical
board
,
without
incroache
a
great
deal
upon
his
other
avocation
.
    
<EOS>
Measures
be
thus
preconcerte
,
the
physician
conduct
our
adventurer
to
the
house
of
this
celebrated
sage
,
to
whom
he
recommend
him
as
a
gentleman
of
genius
and
taste
,
who
crave
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
;
but
he
have
previously
smooth
the
way
to
this
introduction
,
by
represent
Peregrine
as
a
young
fellow
of
great
ambition
,
spirit
and
address
,
who
could
not
fail
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
;
that
,
therefore
,
he
would
be
a
creditable
addition
to
the
subordinate
of
such
a
patron
,
and
by
his
qualification
,
intrepidity
and
warmth
of
temper
,
turn
out
a
consummate
herald
of
his
fame
.
<EOS>
upon
these
consideration
,
he
meet
with
a
most
engaging
reception
from
the
entertainer
,
who
be
a
well
-
breed
man
,
of
some
learning
,
generosity
and
taste
;
but
his
foible
be
the
desire
of
be
think
the
inimitable
pattern
of
all
three
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
view
to
acquire
and
support
this
character
,
that
his
house
be
open
to
all
those
who
have
any
pretension
to
literature
;
consequently
he
be
surround
by
a
strange
variety
of
pretender
;
but
none
be
discourage
,
because
he
know
that
even
the
most
insignificant
might
,
in
some
shape
,
conduce
to
the
propagation
of
his
praise
.
<EOS>
a
babbler
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
can
not
run
upon
the
scent
,
may
spring
the
game
,
and
by
his
yelping
help
to
fill
up
the
cry
:
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
a
youth
of
Pickle
's
accomplishment
be
admit
and
even
invite
into
the
pack
.
<EOS>
after
have
enjoy
a
very
short
private
audience
in
the
closet
,
our
young
gentleman
be
shew
into
another
room
,
where
half
a
dozen
of
his
fellow
-

wait
for
their
Maecenas
,
who
in
a
few
minute
appear
,
with
a
most
gracious

compliment
of
the
morning

and

down
to
breakfast
,
in
the
midst
of
them
,
without
any
further
ceremony

<EOS>
the
conversation
at
first
turn
upon
the
weather
,
which
be
investigate
in
a
very
philosophical
manner
by
one
of
the
company
,
who
seem
to
have
consult
all
the
barometer
and
thermometer
that
ever
be
invent
,
before
he
would
venture
to
affirm
that
it
be
a
chill
morning
.
<EOS>
this
subject
be
accurately
discuss
,
the
chief
inquire
about
the
news
of
the
learned
world
;
and
his
inclination
be
no
sooner
express
than
every
guest
open
his
mouth
,
in
order
to
gratify
his
curiosity
:
but
he
that
first
captivate
his
attention
be
a
meager
,
shrivel
antiquary
,
who
look
like
an
animate
mummy
,
which
have
be
scorch
among
the
sand
of
the
desert
.
    
<EOS>
He
tell
the
patron
,
that
he
have
by
accident
meet
with
a
medal
,
which
,
tho
'
it
be
deface
by
time
,
he
would
venture
to
pronounce
a
genuine
antique
,
from
the
ringing
and
taste
of
the
metal
,
as
well
as
from
the
colour
and
composition
of
the
rust
:
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
produce
a
piece
of
copper
coin
,
so
consume
and
disguise
by
age
,
that
scarce
a
vestige
of
the
impression
be
to
be
perceive
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
this
connoisseur
pretend
to
distinguish
a
face
in
profil
,
from
which
he
conclude
that
the
piece
be
of
the
Upper
empire
,
and
on
the
reverse
he
endeavour
to
point
out
the
bulb
of
the
spear
,
and
part
of
the
parazonium
,
which
be
the
insignia
of
the
Roman
Virtus
,
together
with
the
fragment
of
one
fold
of
the
multicium
in
which
she
be
cloathe
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
have
discover
one
angle
of
the
letter
N
,
and
,
at
some
distance
,
an
intire
<EOS>
I
:
from
these
circumstance
conjecture
,
and
indeed
conclude
,
that
the
medal
be
strike
by
Severus
,
in
honour
of
the
victory
he
obtain
over
his
rival
Niger
,
after
he
have
force
the
pass
of
mount
Taurus
.
<EOS>
this
criticism
seem
very
satisfactory
to
the
entertainer
,
who
have
examine
the
coin
by
the
help
of
his
spectacle
,
plainly
discern
the
particular
which
the
owner
have
mention
,
and
be
pleased
to
term
his
account
of
the
matter
a
very
ingenious
explanation
.
    
<EOS>
the
curiosity
be
circulate
through
the
hand
of
all
present
,
and
every
virtuoso
,
in
his
turn
,
lick
the
copper
,
and
ring
it
upon
the
hearth
,
declare
his
assent
to
the
judgment
which
have
be
pronounce
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
it
fall
under
the
inspection
of
our
young
gentleman
,
who
,
tho
'
no
antiquarian
,
be
very
well
acquaint
with
the
current
coin
of
his
own
country
,
and
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
upon
this
valuable
antique
,
than
he
affirm
,
without
hesitation
,
that
it
be
no
other
than
the
ruin
of
an
English
farthing
,
and
that
same
spear
,
parazonium
,
and
multicium
,
the
remain
of
the
emblem
and
drapery
with
which
the
figure
of
Britannia
be
delineate
on
our
copper
-
money
.
    
<EOS>
this
hardy
asseveration
seem
to
disconcert
the
patron
,
while
it
incense
the
medallist
,
who
grin
like
an
enraged
baboon
,
"
what
d'ye
tell
me
of
a
brass
farthing
?
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
do
you
ever
know
modern
brass
of
such
a
relish
?
<EOS>
do
but
taste
it
,
young
gentleman
;
and
sure
I
be
,
if
you
have
ever
be
conversant
with
subject
of
this
kind
,
you
will
find
as
wide
a
difference
in
the
favour
between
this
and
an
English
farthing
,
as
can
possibly
be
perceive
betwixt
an
onion
and
a
turnip
:
<EOS>
besides
,
this
medal
have
the
true
corinthian
ring
;
then
the
attitude
be
upright
,
whereas
that
of
Britannia
be
recline
;
and
how
be
it
possible
to
mistake
a
branch
of
palm
for
a
parazonium
?
"
    
<EOS>
all
the
rest
of
the
company
espouse
the
virtuoso
's
side
of
the
question
,
because
the
reputation
of
each
be
concerned
;
and
the
patron
find
himself
in
the
same
predicament
,
assume
a
solemnity
of
feature
,
dash
with
a
small
mixture
of
displeasure
,
and
tell
Peregrine
,
that
as
he
have
not
make
that
branch
of
literature
his
particular
study
,
he
be
not
surprised
to
see
him
mistaken
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
Pickle
immediately
understand
the
reproof
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
he
be
shock
at
the
vanity
or
infatuation
of
his
entertainer
and
fellow
-
guest
,
ask
pardon
for
his
presumption
,
which
be
accordingly
excuse
,
in
consideration
of
his
inexperience
;
and
the
English
farthing
dignify
with
the
title
of
a
true
antique
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
person
that
address
himself
to
the
chief
be
a
gentleman
of
a
very
mathematical
turn
,
who
value
himself
upon
the
improvement
he
have
make
in
several
domestic
machine
,
and
now
present
the
plan
of
a
new
contrivance
for
cut
cabbage
,
in
such
a
manner
as
would
secure
the
stock
against
the
rot
rain
,
and
enable
it
to
produce
a
plenteous
after
-
crop
of
delicious
sprout
.
<EOS>
in
this
important
machine
he
have
unite
the
whole
mechanic
power
,
with
such
massy
complication
of
iron
and
wood
,
that
it
could
not
have
be
move
without
the
assistance
of
an
horse
,
and
a
road
make
for
the
convenience
of
the
draught
.
<EOS>
these
objection
be
so
obvious
,
that
they
occur
at
first
sight
to
the
inspector
-
general
,
who
greatly
commend
the
invention
,
which
,
he
observe
,
may
be
apply
to
several
other
useful
purpose
,
could
it
once
be
render
a
little
more
portable
and
commodious
.
    
<EOS>
the
inventor
,
who
have
not
foresee
these
difficulty
,
be
not
prepared
to
surmount
them
;
but
he
take
the
hint
in
good
part
,
and
promise
to
task
his
ability
anew
,
in
alter
the
constitution
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
not
but
that
he
undergo
some
severe
irony
from
the
rest
of
the
virtuosi
,
who
compliment
him
upon
the
momentous
improvement
he
have
make
,
by
which
a
family
may
save
a
dish
of
green
in
a
quarter
,
for
so
trifle
an
expence
as
that
of
purchase
,
work
and
maintain
such
a
stupendous
machine
:
<EOS>
but
no
man
be
more
sarcastic
in
his
remark
upon
this
piece
of
mechanism
than
the
naturalist
,
who
next
appeal
to
the
patron
's
approbation
for
a
curious
disquisition
he
have
make
,
touch
the
procreation
of
muck
fly
,
in
which
he
have
lay
down
a
curious
method
of
collecting
,
preserve
and
hatch
the
egg
of
these
insect
,
even
in
the
winter
,
by
certain
modification
of
artificial
heat
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
this
discovery
be
no
sooner
communicate
,
than
Peregrine
,
unable
to
contain
himself
,
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
which
infect
every
person
at
the
table
,
the
landlord
himself
not
except
,
who
find
it
impossible
to
preserve
his
wonte
gravity
of
face
.
    
<EOS>
Such
unmannerly
mirth
do
not
fail
to
mortify
the
philosopher
,
who
,
after
some
pause
,
during
which
indignation
and
disdain
be
paint
in
his
countenance
,
reprehend
our
young
gentleman
for
his
unphilosophical
behaviour
,
and
undertake
to
prove
,
that
the
subject
of
his
inquiry
be
of
infinite
consequence
to
the
progress
and
increase
of
natural
knowledge
:
but
he
find
no
quarter
from
the
vengeful
engineer
,
who
now
retort
his
ironical
compliment
,
with
great
emphasis
,
upon
this
hot
-
bed
for
the
generation
of
vermin
,
and
advise
him
to
lay
the
whole
process
before
the
Royal
Society
,
which
would
,
doubtless
,
present
him
with
a
medal
,
and
give
him
a
place
among
their
memoir
,
as
a
distinguished
promoter
of
the
useful
art
.
<EOS>
if
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
have
employ
your
study
in
find
out
some
effectual
method
to
destroy
those
insect
which
prejudice
and
annoy
mankind
,
<EOS>
in
all
probability
you
must
have
be
content
with
the
contemplation
of
the
good
you
have
do
;
but
this
curious
expedient
for
multiply
maggot
,
will
surely
intitle
you
to
an
honourable
rank
in
the
list
of
learn
philosopher
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
(
reply
the
naturalist
)
that
you
should
be
so
much
adverse
to
the
propagation
of
insect
,
because
,
in
all
likelihood
,
you
be
afraid
that
they
will
not
leave
you
a
cabbage
to
cut
down
with
that
same
miraculous
machine
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
(
answer
the
mechanic
,
with
great
bitterness
of
voice
and
aspect
)
<EOS>
if
the
cabbage
be
as
light
-
head
as
some
muck
-
worm
philosopher
,
it
will
not
be
worth
cut
down
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
never
dispute
upon
cabbage
with
the
son
of
a
cucumber
,
"
say
the
fly
-
breeder
,
allude
to
the
pedigree
of
his
antagonist
;
who
,
impatient
of
the
affront
,
start
up
with
fury
in
his
look
,
exclaim
,
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
mean
me
,
Sir
?
"
    
<EOS>
here
the
patron
,
perceive
thing
draw
towards
a
rupture
,
interpose
his
authority
,
rebuke
them
for
their
intemperance
,
and
recommend
to
them
amity
and
concord
against
the
Goths
and
Vandals
of
the
age
,
who
take
all
opportunity
of
ridicule
and
discourage
the
adherent
of
knowledge
and
philosophy
.
<EOS>
after
this
exhortation
,
they
have
no
pretence
for
carry
on
the
dispute
,
which
be
dropt
,
in
all
appearance
,
tho
'
<EOS>
the
mechanick
still
retain
his
resentment
;
and
after
breakfast
,
when
the
company
break
up
,
accost
his
adversary
in
the
street
,
desire
to
know
how
he
durst
be
so
insolent
as
to
make
that
scurrilous
reflection
upon
his
family
<EOS>
:
the
fly

fancy
,
thus
question
,
accuse
the
mathematician
of
have
be
the
aggressor
,
in
liken
his
head
to
a
light
cabbage
;
and
here
the
altercation
be
renew
,
the
engineer
proceed
to
the
illustration
of
his
mechanick
,
tilt
up
his
hand
like
a
ballance
,
thrust
it
forward
by
way
of
lever
,
embrace
the
naturalist
's
nose
like
a
wedge
betwixt
two
of
his
finger
,
and
turn
it
round
,
with
the
momentum
of
a
screw
or
peritrochium
.
    
<EOS>
have
they
be
oblige
to
decide
the
dispute
,
with
equal
arm
,
the
assailant
would
have
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
other
,
who
be
very
much
his
inferior
in
muscular
strength
;
but
the
philosopher
,
be
luckily
provide
with
a
cane
,
no
sooner
disengage
himself
from
this
opprobrious
application
,
than
he
handle
his
weapon
with
great
dexterity
about
the
head
and
shoulder
of
his
antagonist
,
who
,
find
this
shower
of
blow
very
disagreeable
,
be
fain
to
betake
himself
to
his
heel
for
shelter
,
and
be
pursue
by
the
angry
victor
,
who
chase
him
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
,
afford
unspeakable
satisfaction
to
the
multitude
,
as
well
as
to
our
hero
and
his
introductor
,
who
be
spectator
of
the
whole
scene
.
    
<EOS>
thus
be
our
adventurer
initiate
in
the
society
of
Yelpers
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
do
not
as
yet
fully
understand
the
nature
of
his
office
,
which
be
explain
by
the
young
physician
,
who
chid
him
for
his
blunt
behaviour
in
the
case
of
the
medal

him
to

that

favour
be
neither
to

nor
preserve
by
any
man
that
would
pretend
to
convict
him
of
a
mistake

he
therefore
counsel
him
to
respect
this
foible
,
and
cultivate
the
old
gentleman
with
all
the
zeal
and
veneration
,
which
a
regard
to
his
own
character
would
permit
him
to
pay
.
<EOS>
this
task
be
the
easy
to
one
of
our
young
gentleman
's
pliant
disposition
,
because
the
virtuoso
's
behaviour
be
absolutely
free
from
that
insolent
self

conceit
,
which
he
could
not
bear
without
disgust

,
on
the
contrary
,
mild
and
beneficent
;
and
Pickle
be
rather
pleased
than
shocked
at
this
weakness

because
it
flatter
his
vanity
with
the
supposition
of
his
own
superior
sense
.
    
<EOS>
Cautioned
in
this
manner
,
Peregrine
profit
so
much
by
his
insinuating
qualification
,
that
,
in
a
very
little
time

he
be
look
upon
as
one
of
the
chief
favourite
of
the
patron
,
to
whom
he
dedicate
a
small
occasional
poem
;
and
every
body
believe
he
would
reap
the
fruit
of
his
attachment
,
among
the
first
of

old

Chapter
CIV
Peregrine
find
himself
neglect
by
Sir
Steady
Steerwell
,
expostulate
with
him
in
a
letter
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
be
forbid
his
house
,
lose
his
pension
,
and
incur
the
reputation
of
a
lunatick
.
   
<EOS>
this
prospect
of
success
,
together
with
his
expectation
from
the
minister
,
whom
he
do
not
neglect
,
help
to
comfort
him
under
the
reverse
of
fortune
which
he
have
undergo
,
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
law
-
suit
,
which
he
still
maintain
for
the
recovery
of
his
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
,
indeed
,
continue
to
drain
his
pocket
of
money
,
while
they
fill
his
brain
with
unsubstantial
hope
;
and
he
be
actually
oblige
to
borrow
money
from
his
book
-
seller
,
on
the
strength
of
the
translation
,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
demand
of
those
ravenous
harpy
,
rather
than
lay
the
misanthrope
under
any
difficulty
,
or
have
recourse
to
his
friend
Hatchway
,
who
live
at
the
garrison
,
intirely
ignorant
of
his
distress
:
and
this
be
not
at
all
alleviate
by
the
arrival
of
the
Indiaman
,
in
which
he
have
venture
seven
hundred
pound
,
as
we
have
already
observe
;
for
he
be
give
to
understand
,
that
the
borrower
be
leave
dangerously
ill
at
Bombay
when
the
ship
sail
,
and
that
his
chance
for
retrieve
his
money
be
extremely
slend
.
    
<EOS>
so
situate
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
he
lead
a
life
of
tranquillity
,
tho
'
he
make
a
shift
to
struggle
with
the
remonstrance
of
misfortune
:
yet
such
a
gush
of
affliction
would
sometimes
rush
upon
his
thought
,
as
overwhelmed
all
the
idea
of
his
hope
,
and
sink
him
to
the
very
bottom
of
despondence
.
<EOS>
every
equipage
that
pass
him
in
the
street
,
every
person
of
rank
and
fortune
that
occur
to
his
view
,
recall
the
gay
image
of
his
former
life
,
with
such
mortifying
reflection
as
stab
him
to
the
very
soul
.
<EOS>
He
live
,
therefore
,
incessantly
expose
to
all
the
pang
of
envy
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
envy
,
I
do
not
mean
that
sordid
passion
,
in
consequence
of
which
a
man
repine
at
his
neighbour
's
success
,
howsoever
deserve
;
but
that
self
-
torment
indignation
which
be
inspire
by
the
prosperity
of
folly
,
ignorance
and
vice
.
<EOS>
without
the
intervene
gleam
of
enjoyment
,
which
he
feel
in
the
conversation
of
a
few
friend
,
he
could
not
have
support
his
existence
;
or
,
at
least
,
he
must
,
have
suffer
some
violent
discomposure
of
the
brain
:
but
one
be
still
find
some
circumstance
of
alleviation
,
even
in
the

and
Pickle

so
ingenious
in
these
research

that
he
maintain
a
good
battle
with
disappointment
,
till
the
revolution
of
the
term
at
which
he
have
receive
his
pension
of
three
hundred
pound

<EOS>
however
,
see
the
day
elapse
,
without
touch
his
allowance
,
notwithstanding
his
significant
method
of
present
himself
at
the
minister
's
levee
,
when
the
year
be
expire
,
he
write
a
letter
to
Sir
Steady
,
remind
him
of
his
situation
and
promise
,
and
give
him
to
understand
,
that
his
occasion
be
such
,
as

him
to
demand
his
salary
for
the

in
the
morning
after

to
his

of

be
mistaken
in
his
hope

the
minister
not

visible

<EOS>
He
then
make
his
appearance
at
the
levee
,
in
hope
of
be
closette
;
but
though
he
take
all
opportunity
of
watch
Sir
Steady
's
eye
,
he
could
not
obtain
one
glance
,
and
have
the
pleasure
of
see
him
retire
,
without

favour
with
the
least
notice

<EOS>
these
circumstance
of
wilful
neglect
be
not
over
and
above
agreeable
to
our
hero
,
who
,
in
the
agony
of
vexation
and
resentment
,
go
home
,
and
compose
a
most
acrimonious
remonstrance
to
his

which

he
be
not

deprive
of
all
pretension
to
a
private
audience

but
expressly
deny
admittance
on
a
public
day
,
by
Sir
Steady

own
order

<EOS>
this
prohibition
,
which
announce
his
total
ruin
,
fill
him
with
rage
,
horror
and
despair
:
he
curse
the
porter
who
signify
the
minister
's
command
,
threaten
to
chastise
him
upon
the
spot
for
his
presumption
,
and
vent
the
most
virulent
imprecation
upon
his
master
,
to
the
astonishment
of
those
who
chance
to
enter
during
this
conference
.
<EOS>
have
exhaust
himself
in
these
vain
exclamation
,
he
return
to
his

in
a
most
frantic
condition

bite
his
lip
so
that
the
blood
run
from

dash
his
head

against
the
side

weep
with
the
most
bitter
expression
of
woe

<EOS>
Pipes
,
whose
perception
have
be
just
sufficient
to
let
him
see
,
that
there
be
some
difference
between
the
present
and
former
situation
of
his
master
,
over
-
hear
his
transport

to
enter

with
a

of
administre
consolation
;
and
find
the
door
lock
on
the
inside

admittance
,

that
otherwise

would
down
with
the

in
the
turning

<EOS>
Peregrine
order
him
to
retire
,
on
pain
of
his
displeasure

swear
,
that
if
he
should
offer
to
break
open
the
door
,
he
would
instantly
shoot
him
through
the
head

<EOS>
Tom
,
without
pay
the
least
regard
to
this
injunction
,
set
himself
at
work
immediately
;
and
his
master
,
exasperate
at
his
want
of
reverence
and
respect
,
which
,
in
his
present
paroxysm
,
appear
with
the
most
provoking
aggravation

fly
into

closet

up

load

enter
the

in

the

full
at

draw
the
trigger

happily
the

flash
in

without

ask
,
without

mad
as
he
be

repent
of
his
mischievous
intent
against
such
a
faithful
adherent
,
in
the
very
moment
of
execution
;
and
have
it
prove
fatal
,
accord
to
the
design
,
in
all
probability
he
would
have
apply
another

his

<EOS>
there
be
certain
consideration
that
strike
upon
the
mind
with
irresistible
force

even
in

of
its
distraction

the
momentary
recollection

the

by
such
an
impulse
be
Pipes
protect
from
any
repeat
effort

his
master
's
rage

the
friendly
cause
of
his
present
disobedience
flash
upon
the
conviction
of
Peregrine
,
when
he
behold
the
rugged
front
of

valet

in
which
also

his
long
and
faithful

interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Crabtree
,
who
see
Peregrine
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
,
and
such
wild
disorder
in
his
look
,
his
head
,
hand
and
mouth
besmear
with
blood
,
and
,
moreover
,
smell
the
gunpowder
which
have
be
burn
,
actually
believe
he
have
either
commit
,
or
be
bent
upon
murder
,
and
,
accordingly
,
retreat
down
stair
with
infinite
dispatch
;
though
all
his
speed
could
not
convey
him
without
the
reach
of
Pipes
,
who
overtake
him
in
the
passage
,
carry
him
back
into
his
master
's
apartment
,
observe
by
the
way
,
that
this
be
no
time
to
sheer
off
,
when
his
consort
stand
in
need
of
his
assistance

<EOS>
there
be
something
so
ruefully
severe
in
the
countenance
of
Cadwallader
,
thus
compel
,
that
at
any
other
time
,
our
hero
would
have
laugh
at
his
concern
;
but
at
present
,
there
be
nothing
risible
in
his
disposition
:
he
have
,
however
,
lay
aside
his
pistol
,
and
endeavour
,
though
in
vain
,
to
compose
his
internal
disturbance
;
for
he
could
not
utter
one
syllable
to
the
misanthrope
,
but
stand
stare
at
him
in
silence
,
with
a
most
delirious
aspect
,
which
do
not
tend
to
dispel
the
dismay
of
his
friend

who
,
after
some
recollection
,
"
I
wonder
,
(
say
he

<EOS>
that
you

never
kill
your

how

Pickle
have
recover
the
faculty
of
speech
,
order
his
lacquey
out
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
most
incoherent
detail
,
make
Crabtree
acquaint
with
the
perfidious
conduct
of
the
minister
.
    
<EOS>
the
confident
be
very
glad
to
find
his
fear
disappoint
;
for
he
have
really
conclude
,
that
some
life
be
lose
:
and
perceive
the
youth
too
much
agitate
to
be
treat
by
him
in
his
usual
stile
,
he
own
that
Sir
Steady
be
a
rascal
,
encourage
Pickle
with
the
hope
of
be
one
day
able
to
make
reprisal
upon
him
;
in
the
mean
time
,
offer
hi
money
for
his
immediate
occasion
,
exhort
him
to
exert
his
own
qualification
in
render
himself
independent
of
such
miscreant
,
and
finally
,
counsel
him
to
represent
his
wrong
to
the
nobleman
whom
he
have
formerly
oblige
,
with
a
view
of
interesting
that
peer
in
his
behalf
,
or
at
least
of
obtain
a
satisfactory
explanation
from
the
minister
,
that
he
may
take
no
premature
measure
of
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
these
admonition
be
so
much
milder
,
and
more
agreeable
than
our
hero
expect
from
the
misanthrope
,
that
they
have
a
very
favourable
effect
upon
his
transport
,
which
gradually
subside
,
until
he
become
so
tractable
,
as
to
promise
that
he
would
conform
to
his
advice
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
next
morning
wait
upon
his
lordship
,
who
receive
him
very
politely
,
as
usual
,
and
with
great
patience
hear
his
complaint
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
could
not
repeat
without
some
hasty
ebullition
of
passionate
resentment
.
<EOS>
this
peer
,
after
have
gently
disapprove
of
the
letter
of
postulation
,
which
have
produce
such
unfortunate
effect
,
kindly
undertake
to
recommend
his
case
to
the
minister
,
and
actually
perform
his
promise
that
same
day
,
when
Sir
Steady
inform
him
,
to
his
utter
astonishment
,
that
the
poor
young
gentleman
be
disorder
in
his
brain
,
so
that
he
could
not
possibly
be
provide
for
in
a
place
of
importance
,
with
any
regard
to
the
service
;
and
it
could
not
be
expect
that
he
(
Sir
Steady
)
would
support
his
extravagance
from
his
own
private
purse
:
that
he
have
indeed
,
at
the
solicitation
of
a
nobleman
deceased
,
make
him
a
present
of
three
hundred
pound
,
in
consideration
of
some
loss
that
he
pretend
to
have
sustain
in
an
election
;
but
,
since
that
time
,
have
perceive
in
him
such
indisputable
mark
of
lunacy
,
both
by
his
distracted
letter
and
personal
behaviour
,
as
oblige
him
to
give
order
,
that
he
should
not
be
admit
into
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
to
corroborate
this
assertion
,
the
minister
actually
call
in
the
evidence
of
his
own
porter
,
and
one
of
the
gentleman
of
his
houshold
,
who
have
hear
the
execration
that
escape
our
youth
,
when
he
first
find
himself
exclude
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
nobleman
be
convince
,
that
Peregrine
be
certainly
and
bona
fide
mad
as
a
March
hare
;
and
,
by
the
help
of
this
intimation
,
begin
to
recollect
some
symptom
of
distraction
which
appear
in
his
last
visit
;
he
remember
a
certain
incoherence
in
his
speech
,
a
violence
of
gesture
and
wildness
of
look
,
that
now
evidently
denote
a
disturbed
understanding
:
and
he
determine
,
for
his
own
credit
and
security
,
to
disentangle
himself
from
such
a
dangerous
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
,
in
imitation
of
Sir
Steady
,
command
his
gate
to
be
shut
against
our
adventurer
;
so
that
when
he
go
to
know
the
result
of
his
lordship
's
conference
with
the
minister
,
the
door
be
flung
in
his
face
,
and
the
janitor
tell
him
through
an
iron
grate
,
that
he
need
not
give
himself
the
trouble
of
call
again
,
for
his
lord
desire
to
be
excuse
from
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
speak
not
a
word
in
answer
to
this
declaration
,
which
he
immediately
impute
to
the
ill
office
of
the
minister
,
against
whom
he
breathe
defiance
and
revenge
,
in
his
way
to
the
lodging
of
Cadwallader
;
who
be
make
acquainted
with
the
manner
of
his
reception
,
begg'd
<EOS>
he
would
desist
from
all
scheme
of
vengeance
,
until
he
(
Crabtree
)
should
be
able
to
unriddle
the
mystery
of
the
whole
,
which
he
do
not
doubt
of
unveil
,
by
mean
of
his
acquaintance
with
a
family
,
in
which
his
lordship
often
spend
the
evening
at
whist
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
he
have
the
desire
opportunity
;
the
nobleman
be
under
no
injunction
or
obligation
to
keep
the
affair
secret
,
discover
the
young
gentleman
's
misfortune
,
by
way
of
news
,
to
the
first
company
in
which
he
happen
to
be
;
and
Peregrine
's
name
be
not
so
obscure
in
the
fashionable
world
,
but
that
his
disorder
become
the
general
topic
of
conversation
for
a
day
;
so
that
his
friend
soon
partook
of
the
intelligence
,
and
find
mean
to
learn
the
particular
of
the
minister
's
information
,
as
above
relate
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
be
in
danger
of
become
a
proselyte
to
Sir
Steady
's
opinion
,
when
he
recall
and
compare
every
circumstance
which
he
know
of
Pickle
's
impatience
and
impetuosity
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
,
nothing
more
easily
gain
credit
than
an
imputation
of
madness
fix
upon
any
person
whatsoever
:
for
when
the
suspicion
of
the
world
be
rouse
,
and
its
observation
once
set
at
work
,
the
wise
,
the
cool
man
upon
earth
,
will
,
by
some
particular
in
his
behaviour
,
convict
himself
of
the
charge
:
every
singularity
in
his
dress
and
manner
(
and
such
be
observable
in
every
person
)
<EOS>
that
before
pass
unheeded
,
now
rise
up
in
judgment
against
him
,
with
all
the
exaggeration
of
the
observer
's
fancy
;
and
the
sagacious
examiner
perceive
distraction
in
every
glance
of
the
eye
,
turn
of
the
finger
,
and
motion
of
the
head
:
when
he
speak
,
there
be
a
strange
peculiarity
in
his
argument
and
expression
;
when
he
hold
his
tongue
,
his
imagination
teem
with
some
extravagant
reverie
;
his
sobriety
of
demeanour
be
no
other
than
a
lucid
interval
,
and
his
passion
mere
delirium
.
    
<EOS>
if
people
of
the
most
sedate
and
insipid
life
and
conversation
be
subject
to
such
criticism
,
no
wonder
that
they
should
take
place
upon
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
fiery
disposition
,
which
,
on
some
occasion
,
would
have
actually
justify
any
remark
of
this
kind
,
which
his
great
enemy
could
make
.
<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
represent
as
one
of
those
enterprize
Bucks
,
who
,
after
have
spend
their
fortune
in
riot
and
excess
,
be
happily
bereft
of
their
understanding
,
and
consequently
insensible
of
the
want
and
disgrace
which
they
have
intaile
upon
themselves
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
himself
be
so
much
affect
with
the
report
,
that
for
some
time
he
hesitate
in
his
deliberation
upon
our
hero
,
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
communicate
to
him
the
information
he
have
receive
,
or
to
treat
him
in
other
respect
as
a
man
of
sound
intellect
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
venture
to
make
Pickle
acquaint
with
the
particular
he
have
learn'd
,
impart
them
with
such
caution
and
circumlocution
,
as
he
think
necessary
to
prevent
the
young
gentleman
from
transgress
all
bound
of
temper
and
moderation
:
but
,
for
once
,
he
be
agreably
deceive
in
his
prognostic
.
<EOS>
incense
as
our
hero
be
at
the
conduct
of
the
minister
,
he
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
aspersion
,
which
,
he
tell
his
friend
,
he
would
soon
refute
in
a
manner
that
should
not
be
very
agreeable
to
his
calumniator
;
observe
that
it
be
a
common
practice
with
this
state
pilot
,
thus
to
slander
those
people
to
whom
he
lie
under
obligation
which
he
have
no
mind
to
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
"
true
it
be
,
(
say
Peregrine
)
<EOS>
he
have
succeed
more
than
once
in
contrivance
of
this
kind

have
actually
reduce
diver
people
of
weak
head
to
such
extremity
of
despair
,
as
hath
issue
in
downright
distraction
,
whereby
he
be
rid
of
their
importunity
,
and
his
judgment
confirm
at
the

time
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
now
(
thank
heaven
)
attain
to
such
a
pitch
of
philosophical
resolution
,
as
will
support
me
against
all
his
machination
;
and
I
will
forthwith
exhibit
the
monster
to
the
public
,
in
his
true
lineament
of
craft
,
perfidy
and
ingratitude
.

<EOS>
this
indeed
be
the
plan
with
which
Mr
Pickle
have
amuse
himself
during
the
research
of
Crabtree
;
and
by
this
time
it
so
effectually
flatter
his
imagination
,
that
he
believe
he
should
be
able
to
bring
his
adversary
(
in
spite
of
all
his
power
)
to
his
own
term
of
submission
,
by
distinguish
himself
in
the
list
of
those
who
,
at
that
period
,
write
against
the
administration
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
scheme
so
extravagant
as
it
may
seem
to
be
,
have
not
he
overlook
one
material
circumstance
,
which
Cadwallader
himself
do
not
recollect
,
when
he
approve
of
this
project
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
meditate
vengeance
,
the
fame
of
his
disorder
,
in
due
course
of
circulation
,
reach
the
ear
of
that
lady
of
quality
,
whose
memoir
have
appear
in
the
third
volume
of
these
adventure
.
<EOS>
the
correspondence
with
which
she
have
honour
our
hero
have
be
long
break
off
,
for
the
reason
already
advance
,
namely
,
his
dread
of
be
expose
to
her
infatuating
charm
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
candid
enough
to
make
her
acquaint
with
this
cause
of
exile
himself
from
her
presence
;
and
she
admit
the
prudence
of
his
self
-
restraint
,
although
she
could
have
be
very
well
satisfied
with
the
continuance
of
his
intimacy
and
conversation
,
which
be
not
at
all
beneath
the
desire
of
any
lady
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
interruption
,
she
still
retain
a
friendship
and
regard
for
his
character
,
and
feel
all
the
affliction
of
a
humane
heart
,
at
the
news
of
his
misfortune
and
deplorable
distemper
.
    
<EOS>
She
have
see
him
court
and
cultivate
in
the
sun
-
shine
of
his
prosperity
;
but
she
know
from
sad
experience
,
how
all
those
insect
follower
shrink
away
in
the
winter
of
distress
.
<EOS>
Her
compassion
represent
him
as
a
poor
unhappy
lunatic
,
destitute
of
all
the
necessary
of
life
,
drag
about
the
ruin
of
human
nature
,
and
exhibit
the
spectacle
of
blast
youth
,
to
the
scorn
and
abhorrence
of
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
ake
with
these
charitable
consideration
,
she
find
mean
to
learn
in
what
part
of
the
town
he
lodge
;
and
lay
aside
all
superfluous
ceremony
,
go
in
a
hackney
-
chair
to
his
door
,
which
be
open
by
the
ever
-
faithful
Pipes
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
immediately
recollect
the
feature
of
this
trusty
follower
,
whom
she
could
not
help
love
in
her
heart
,
for
his
attachment
and
fidelity
,
which
,
after
she
have
applaud
with
a
most
gracious
commendation
,
she
kindly
inquire
after
the
state
of
his
master
's
health
,
and
ask
if
he
be
in
a
condition
to
be
see
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
,
who
could
not
suppose
that
the
visit
of
a
fine
lady
would
be
unacceptable
to
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
complexion
,
make
no
verbal
reply
to
the
question
;
but
beckon
her
ladyship
with
an
arch
significance
of
feature
,
at
which
she
could
not
forbear
smile
,
he
walk
softly
up
stair
;
and
she
,
in
obedience
to
the
signal
,
follow
her
guide
into
the
apartment
of
our
hero
,
whom
she
find
at
a
writing
-
table
,
in
the
very
act
of
compose
an
eulogium
upon
his
good
friend
Sir
Steady
.
    
<EOS>
the
nature
of
his
work
have
animate
his
countenance
with
an
uncommon
degree
of
vivacity
;
and
be
dress
in
a
neat
dishabille
,
his
figure
could
not
have
appear
to
more
advantage
,
in
the
eye
of
a
person
who
despise
the
tinsel
of
unnecessary
ornament
.
<EOS>
She
be
extremely
well
pleased
to
see
the
expectation
so
agreeably
disappointed
;
for
,
instead
of
the
squalid
circumstance
and
wretched
look
attend
indigence
and
distraction
,
every
thing
be
decent
and
genteel
;
and
the
patient
's
aspect
<EOS>
such
,
as
betoken
internal
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
hear
the
rustling
of
silk
in
his
room
,
he
lift
up
his
eye
from
the
paper
,
and
see
her
ladyship
,
be
strike
with
astonishment
and
awe
,
as
at
the
unexpected
apparition
of
some
supernatural
being
.
    
<EOS>
before
he
could
recollect
himself
from
his
confusion
,
which
call
the
blood
into
his
cheek
,
she
tell
him
,
that
,
on
the
strength
of
old
acquaintance
,
she
be
come
to
visit
him
,
though
it
be
a
long
time
since
he
have
give
her
good
reason
to
believe
,
he
have
absolutely
forget
that
there
be
such
a
person
as
she
in
be
.
<EOS>
after
have
make
the
most
warm
acknowledgment
for
this
unforeseen
honour
,
he
assure
her
ladyship
,
that
the
subject
of
her
reproach
be
not
his
fault
,
but
rather
his
very
great
misfortune
;
and
that
if
it
have
be
in
his
power
to
forget
her
so
easily
,
as
she
seem
to
imagine
,
he
should
never
have
give
her
cause
to
tax
him
with
want
of
duty
and
respect
.
    
<EOS>
still
dubious
of
his
situation
,
she
begin
to
converse
with
him
on
different
subject
;
and
he
acquit
himself
so
well
in
every
particular
,
that
she
no
longer
doubt
his
have
be
misrepresent
by
the
malice
of
his
enemy
;
and
candidly
tell
him
the
cause
and
intent
of
her
come
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
deficient
in
expression
of
gratitude
for
this
instance
of
her
generosity
and
friendship
,
which
even
draw
tear
from
his
eye
;
and
as
to
the
imputation
of
madness
,
he
explain
it
so
much
to
her
ladyship
's
satisfaction
,
that
she
evidently
perceive
he
have
be
barbarously
deal
with
,
and
that
the
charge
be
no
other
than
a
most
villainous
aspersion
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
his
endeavour
to
conceal
the
true
state
of
his
finance
,
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
give
this
detail
,
without
disclose
some
of
the
difficulty
under
which
he
labour
;
and
her
ladyship
's
sagacity
divine
the
rest
,
she
not
only
make
him
a
tender
of
assistance
,
but
present
a
bank
-
note
for
a
considerable
sum
,
insist
upon
his
acceptance
of
it
,
as
a
trifling
mark
of
her
esteem
,
and
a
speciman
of
what
she
be
inclined
to
do
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
but
this
mark
of
her
benevolence
he
would
by
no
mean
receive
;
assure
her
,
that
though
his
affair
be
at
present
a
little
perplexed
,
he
have
never
feel
the
least
circumstance
of
distress
,
and
beg
that
she
would
not
subject
him
to
the
burthen
of
such
an
unnecessary
obligation
.
    
<EOS>
be
oblige
to
put
up
with
this
refusal
,
she
protest
she
would
never
forgive
him
,
should
she
ever
hear
that
he
reject
her
offer
,
when
he
stand
in
need
of
her
aid
;
or
if
in
time
to
come
,
he
should
not
apply
to
her
friendship
,
if
ever
he
should
find
himself
incommode
in
point
of
fortune
:
"
an
over
-
delicacy
in
this
respect
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
shall
look
upon
as
a
disapprobation
of
my
own
conduct
;
because
I
myself
have
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
my
friend
,
in
such
emergency
.
"
    
<EOS>
these
generous
remonstrance
and
mark
of
particular
friendship
,
could
not
fail
to
make
deep
impression
upon
the
heart
of
our
hero
,
which
still
smart
from
the
former
impulse
of
her
charm
:
he
not
only
feel
all
those
transport
which
a
man
of
honour
and
sensibility
may
be
suppose
to
feel
upon
such
an
occasion
,
but
the
sentiment
of
a
more
tender
passion
awake
in
his
breast
,
he
could
not
help
express
himself
in
term
adapt
to
the
emotion
of
his
soul
;
and
at
length
plainly
tell
her
,
that
be
he
dispose
to
be
a
beggar
,
he
would
ask
something
of
infinitely
more
importance
to
his
peace
,
than
the
charitable
assistance
she
have
proffer
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
have
too
much
penetration
to
mistake
his
meaning
;
but
as
she
do
not
chuse
to
encourage
his
advance
,
pretend
to
interpret
his
intimation
into
a
general
compliment
of
gallantry
,
and
in
a
jocose
manner
,
desire
he
would
not
give
her
any
reason
to
believe
his
lucid
interval
be
past
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
faith
,
my
lady
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
the
fit
come
on
;
and
I
do
not
see
why
I
may
not
use
the
privilege
of
my
distemper
,
so
far
as
to
declare
myself
one
of
your
most
passionate
admirer
.

<EOS>
"
if
you
do

her

<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
fool
enough
to

I

that
your

Nay

he
open

take
out

present
her
with

,
in

procure

<EOS>
have
he
know
the
young

talent
for
declamation
be
so
acute
,
perhaps
he
would
never
have
give
him
cause
to
complain
,
but
employ
him
in
the
vindication
of
his

measure
;
nay

he
may
still
have
treat
him
like
some
other

that
he
have
a
writ
against
him
for
twelve
hundred
pound

at
the
suit
of
Mr
Ravage
Gleanum
.
    
<EOS>
the
whole
company
be
astonish
at
this
address
,
which
do
not
fail
to
discompose
the
defendant
himself
,
who
(
as
it
be
instinctively
)
in
the
midst
of
his
confusion
,
salute
the
officer
across
the
head
with
his
cane
;
in
consequence
of
which
application
,
he
be
surround
and
disarm
in
an
instant
by
the
gang
,
who
carry
him
off
to
the
next
tavern
in
the
most
opprobrious
manner
.
<EOS>
nor
do
one
of
the
spectator
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
or
visit
him
in
his
confinement
with
the
least
tender
of
advice
or
assistance
;
such
be
the
zeal
of
a
coffee
-
house
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
this
stroke
be
the
more
severe
upon
our
hero
,
as
it
be
altogether
unexpected
;
for
he
have
utterly
forget
the
debt
for
which
he
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
His
present
indignation
be
,
however
,
chiefly
kindle
against
the
bailiff
,
who
have
do
his
office
in
such
a
disrespectful
manner
:
and
the
first
use
he
make
of
his
recollection
in
the
house
to
which
they
conduct
him
,
be
to
chastise
him
for
the
insolence
and
indecency
of
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
this
task
he
perform
with
his
bare
fist
,
every
other
weapon
be
previously
convey
out
of
his
reach
;
and
the
delinquent
undergo
his
discipline
with
surprising
patience
and
resignation
,
ask
pardon
with
great
humility
,
and
protest
before
God
,
that
he
have
never
willingly
and
wittingly
use
any
gentleman
with
ill
manner
,
but
have
be
command
to
arrest
our
adventurer
accord
to
the
express
direction
of
the
creditor
,
on
pain
of
forfeit
his
place
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
declaration
Peregrine
be
appease
,
and
out
of
a
delirium
of
passion
,
wake
to
all
the
horror
of
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
all
the
glory
of
his
youth
be
now
eclipse
,
all
the
blossom
of
his
hope
be
blast
,
and
he
see
himself
doom
to
the
misery
of
a
jail
,
without
the
least
prospect
of
enlargement
,
except
in
the
issue
of
his
law
-
suit
,
of
which
he
have
,
for
some
time
past
,
grow
less
and
less
confident
every
day
.
<EOS>
what
would
become
of
the
unfortunate
,
if
the
constitution
of
the
mind
do
not
permit
them
to
bring
one
passion
into
the
field
against
another
?
<EOS>
passion
that
operate
in
the
human
breast
,
like
poison
of
a
different
nature
,
extinguish
each
other

<EOS>
Our
hero
's
grief
reign
in
full
despotism
,
until
it
be
depose
by
revenge
;
during
the
predominancy
of
which
,
he
consider
every
thing
which
have
happen
as
a
circumstance
conducive
to
its
gratification
:
"
if
I
must
be
prisoner
for
life
,
(
say
he
to
himself
)
if
I
must
relinquish
all
my
gay
expectation
,
let
me
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
clank
my
chain
so
as
to
interrupt
the
repose
of
my
adversary
;
and
let
me
search
in
my
own
breast
for
that
peace
and
contentment
,
which
I
have
not
be
able
to
find
in
all
the
scene
of
my
success

I

from
folly

ingratitude

as
well

exempt
from
an
expence
,
which
I
should
have
find
it
very
difficult
,
if
not
impracticable

to
support
;
I
shall
have
little
or
no
temptation
to
mispend
my
time
,
and
more
undisturbed
opportunity
to
earn
my
subsistence
,
and
prosecute
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
after
all

a
jail
be
the
good
tub
to
which
a
cynic
philosopher
can
retire
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
comfortable
reflection
,
he

a
letter
to
Mr

who
would

him
in
the
step
necessary

for
that
purpose

<EOS>
the
Misanthrope

upon
the
receit

go
in

a

for
the
convenience
of
the
prisoner
,
who
pay
so
much
per
week
for
that
accommodation
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
community
be
like
a
city

from
all
communication
with
the
neighbouring
part
,
regulate
by
its
own
law
,
and
furnish
with
peculiar
convenience
,
for

<EOS>
there

a
coffee

to
go
to
market
,
at
the
pleasure
of
individual

without

or
reward
from
those
who
employ

nor
be
they
coope
up
,
so
as
to
be
exclude
from
the
benefit
of
fresh
air
,
there
be
an
open
area
of
a
considerable
extent
adjacent
to

on
which
they
may

themselves
in

<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
admit
a
denizen
of
this
community
,
find
himself
bewilder
in
the
midst
of
stranger
,
who
,
by
their
appearance
,
do
not
at
all
prepossess
him
in
their
favour
;
and
after
have
stroll
about
the
place
with
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
repair
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
in
order
to
be
further
inform
of
the
peculiar
custom
which
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
know
.
    
<EOS>
there
,
while
he
endeavour
to
pick
up
intelligence
from
the
bar
-
keeper
,
he
be
accost
by
a
person
in
canonical
,
who
very
civilly
ask
if
he
be
a
new

comer
,
and
be
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
give
him
the
salutation
of
welcome
to
the
society
,
and
,
with
great
hospitality
,
undertake
to
initiate
him
in
the
constitution
of
the
brotherhood
.
    
<EOS>
this
humane
clergyman
give
him
to
understand
,
that
his
first
care
ought
to
be
that
of
secure
a
lodging
;
tell
him
,
there
be
a
certain
number
of
apartment
in
the
prison
let
at
the
same
price
,
though
some
be
more
commodious
than
other
;
and
that
when
the
well
sort
become
vacant
,
by
the
removal
of
their
possessor
,
those
who
succeed
in
point
of
seniority
,
have
the
privilege
of
occupy
the
empty
tenement
,
preferable
to
the
rest
of
the
inhabitant
,
howsoever
respectable
they
may
otherwise
be
:
that
when
the
jail
be
very
much
crowded
,
there
be
but
one
chamber
allot
for
two
lodger
;
but
this
be
not
consider
as
any
great
hardship
on
the
prisoner
,
because
,
in
that
case
,
there
be
always
a
sufficient
number
of
male
,
who
willingly
admit
the
female
to
a
share
of
their
apartment
and
bed
:
<EOS>
not
but
the
time
have
be
,
when
this
expedient
would
not
answer
the
occasion
,
because
,
after
a
couple
have
be
quarter
in
every
room
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
considerable
residue
still
unprovided
with
lodging
;
so
that
for
the
time
being
,
the
last
comer
be
oblige
to
take
up
their
habitation
in
Mount
Scoundrel
,
an
apartment
most
miserably
furnished
,
in
which
they
lie
promiscuously
amidst
filth
and
vermin
,
until
they
could
be
better
accommodate
in
due
course
of
rotation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
hear
the
description
of
this
place
,
begin
to
be
very
impatient
about
his
night
's
lodging
;
and
the
parson
perceive
his
anxiety
,
conduct
him
,
without
loss
of
time
,
to
the
warden
,
who
forthwith
put
him
in
possession
of
a
paultry
chamber
,
for
which
he
agree
to
pay
half
a
crown
a
week
.
<EOS>
this
point
be
settle
,
his
director
give
him
an
account
of
the
different
method
of
eating
,
either
singly
,
in
a
mess
,
or
at
an
ordinary
;
and
advise
him
to
chuse
the
last
,
as
the
most
reputable
,
offer
to
introduce
him
next
day
to
the
good
company
in
the
Fleet
,
who
always
dine
together
in
public
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
have
thank
this
gentleman
for
his
civility
,
and
promise
to
be
govern
by
his
advice
,
invite
him
to
pass
the
evening
at
his
apartment
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
shut
himself
up
with
Crabtree
,
in
order
to
deliberate
upon
the
wreck
of
his
affair
.
<EOS>
of
all
his
ample
fortune
,
nothing
now
remain
but
his
wardrobe
,
which
be
not
very
sumptuous
,
about
thirty
guinea
in
cash
,
and
the
garison
,
which
the
misanthrope
counsel
him
to
convert
into
ready
money
,
for
his
present
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
this
advice
,
however
,
he
absolutely
reject
,
not
only
on
account
of
his
have
already
bestow
it
upon
Hatchway
,
during
the
term
of
his
natural
life
,
but
also
with
a
view
of
retain
some
memorial
of
the
commodore
's
generosity
.
<EOS>
He
propose
,
therefore
,
to
finish
in
this
retreat
the
translation
which
he
have
undertake
,
and
earn
his
future
subsistence
by
labour
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
He
desire
Cadwallader
to
take
charge
of
his
moveable
,
and
send
to
him
such
linen
and
cloath
as
he
should
have
occasion
for
in
his
confinement
.
<EOS>
but
,
among
all
his
difficulty
,
nothing
embarasse
him
so
much
as
his
faithful
Pipes
,
whom
he
could
no
longer
entertain
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
He
know
Tom
have
make
shift
to
pick
up
a
competency
in
the
course
of
his
ministration
;
but
that
reflection
,
though
it
in
some
measure
alleviate
,
could
not
wholly
prevent
the
mortification
he
must
suffer
in
part
with
an
affectionate
adherent
,
who
be
by
this
time
become
as
necessary
to
him
as
one
of
his
own
member
,
and
who
be
so
accustomed
to
live
under
his
command
and
protection
,
that
he
do
not
believe
the
fellow
could
reconcile
himself
to
any
other
way
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
Crabtree
,
in
order
to
make
himself
easy
on
that
score
,
offer
to
adopt
him
in
the
room
of
his
own
valet
,
whom
he
would
dismiss
;
though
he
observe
,
that
Pipes
have
be
quite
spoil
in
our
hero
's
service
.
<EOS>
but
Peregrine
do
not
chuse
to
lay
his
friend
under
that
inconvenience
,
know
that
his
present
lacquey
understand
and
comply
with
all
the
peculiarity
of
his
humour
,
which
Pipes
would
never
be
able
to
study
or
regard
;
and
therefore
determine
to
send
him
back
to
his
ship
-
mate
Hatchway
,
with
whom
he
have
spend
the
fore

part
of
his

begin
to
discover
sign
of
curiosity
,
touch
our
hero
's
situation
;
and
Pickle
,
think
he
could
do
no
less
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
,
who
have
treat
him
in
such
an
hospitable
manner
,
favour
him
with
a
detail
of
the
circumstance
which
produce
his
imprisonment
:
at
the
same
time
,
gratify
his
resentment
against
the
minister
,
which
delight
in
recapitulate
the
injury
he
have
receive
.
    
<EOS>
the
parson
,
who
have
be
prepossess
in
favour
of
our
youth
at
first
sight
,
understand
what
a
considerable
part
he
have
act
on
the
stage
of
life
,
feel
his
veneration
increase
;
and
,
please
with
the
opportunity
of
introduce
a
stranger
of
his
consequence
to
the
club
,
leave
him
to
his
repose
,
or
rather
to
ruminate
on
an
event
which
he
have
not
as
yet
seriously
consider
.
    
<EOS>
I
may
here
,
in
imitation
of
some
celebrate
writer
,
furnish
out
a
page
or
two
,
with
the
reflection
he
make
upon
the
instability
of
human
affair
,
the
treachery
of
the
world
,
and
the
temerity
of
youth
;
and
endeavour
to
decoy
the
reader
into
a
smile
,
by
some
quaint
observation
of
my
own
,
touch
the
sagacious
moralizer
:
but
,
besides
that
I
look
upon
this
practice
as
an
impertinent
anticipation
of
the
peruser
's
thought
<EOS>
,
I
have
too
much
matter
of
importance
upon
my
hand
,
to
give
the
reader
the
least
reason
to
believe
that
I
be
drive
to
such
paultry
shift
,
in
order
to
eke
out
the
volume
.
<EOS>
suffice
it
then
,
to
say
,
our
adventurer
pass
a
very
uneasy
night
,
not
only
from
the
thorny
suggestion
of
his
mind
,
but
likewise
from
the
anguish
of
his
body
,
which
suffer
from
the
hardness
of
his
couch
,
as
well
as
from
the
natural
inhabitant
thereof
,
which
do
not
tamely
suffer
his
intrusion
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
morning
he
be
wake
by
Pipes
,
who
bring
upon
his
shoulder
a
portmanteau
fill
with
necessary
,
accord
to
the
direction
of
Cadwallader
;
and
toss
it
down
upon
the
floor
,
regale
himself
with
a
quid
,
without
the
least
manifestation
of
concern
.
<EOS>
after
some
pause
,
"
You
see
,
Pipes
,
(
say
his
master
)
to
what
I
have
bring
myself
.

"
Ey

(

the

once
the

ashore
,
what

<EOS>
We
must
bear
a
hand
to
tow
her
off

if
we
can
:
if
she
will
not
budge
for
all
the
anchor
and

after
we
have
lighten
her
,
by
cut
away
her
mast
,
and
heave
our

overboard
,
why
then
,
mayhap
,
a
brisk
gale
of
wind
,
a
tide
,
or
current
setting
from

may
float
her

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
spread
his
whole
stock
upon
the
table
,
for
the
acceptance
of
Peregrine
;
who
,
be
very
much
affect
with

fresh

express
his
satisfaction
at

,
observe
that

be
no

advise
him
to
retire

he
would
be
kindly

his
friend
Hatchway
,
to
whom
he
would
recommend
him
in
the
strong
term

<EOS>
Pipes
look
blank
at
this
unexpected
intimation
,
to
which
he
reply
,
that
he
want
neither
pay
nor
provision
,
but
only
to
be
employ
as
a
tender
;
and
that
he
would
not
steer
his
course
for
the
garison
,
unless
his
master
would
first
take
his
lumber
aboard
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
however
,
peremptorily
refuse
to
touch
a
farthing
of
the
money
,
which
he
command
him
to
put
up
;
and
Pipes
be
so
mortify
at
his
refusal
,
that
,
twist
the
note
together
,
he
throw
them
into
the
fire
without
hesitation
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
damn
the
money
!
"
and
the
canvas
-
bag
,
with
its
content
,
would
have
share
the
same
fate
,
have
not
Peregrine
start
up
,
and
snatch
the
paper
from
the
flame
,
order
his

to
forbear

on
pain
of
be
banish
for
ever

<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
that
,
for
the
present
,
there
be
a
necessity
for
his
be
dismiss
,
and
he
discharge
him
accordingly
;
but
if
he
would
go
and
live
quietly
with
the
lieutenant
,
he
promise
,
on
the
first
favourable
turn
of
his
fortune
,
to
take
him
again
into
his
service
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
he
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
neither
want
,
nor
would
make
any
use
of
his
money
,
which
he
insist
upon
his
pocketing
immediately
,
on
pain
of
forfeit
all
title
to
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
be
very
much
chagrin
at
these
injunction
,
to
which
he
make
no
reply
;
but
sweep
the
money
into
his
bag
,
stalk
off
,
in
silence
,
with
a
look
of
grief
and
mortification
,
which
his
countenance
have
never
exhibit
before
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
proud
heart
of
Pickle
unmove
upon
this
occasion
:
he
could
scarce
suppress
his
sorrow
in
the
presence
of
Pipes
,
and
,
soon
as
he
be
go
,
it
vent
itself
in
tear
.
    
<EOS>
have
no
great
pleasure
in

he
dress

with
all
convenient

by
one
of
the
occasional

who

and
this
operation

he
go

at

where
he
happen
to
meet
with
his

and
several
person
of
genteel
appearance

to
whom
the

<EOS>
by
these

a
place

where
they
spend
the
forenoon
in

an

and
about

o'clock

for
the
trial
of
two
delinquent

the

<EOS>
the
culprit

be
very
obstreperous

and
absolutely
refuse
to
obey
the
summon

with
many
expression
of

dangerously
wound

<EOS>
this
outrage
be
such
an
aggravation
of
his
crime
,
that
the
court
would
not
venture
to
decide
upon
it
,
but
remit
him
to
the
sentence
of
the
warden

by
virtue

remarkable
escape
from
bailiff

a
man
of
superior
genius
and
address

<EOS>
among
other
extraordinary
adventure
of
this
kind
,
none
be
more
romantic
than
the
last
elopement
atchieve
by
the
officer

who
tell
them
,
he
have
be
arrest
for
a
debt
of
two
hundred
pound
,
at
a
time
when
he
could
not
command
as
many
pence
,
and
convey
to
the
bailiff
's
house
,
in
which
he
continue
a
whole
fortnight
,
move
his
lodging
higher
and
high
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
proportion
to
the
decay
of
his
credit
;
until
,
from
the
parlour
,
he
have
make
a
regular
ascent
to
the
garret
.
<EOS>
there
while
he
ruminate
on
his
next
step
,
which
would
have
be
to
the
Marshalsea
,
and
see
the
night
come
on
,
attend
with
hunger
and
cold
,
the
wind
begin
to
blow
,
and
the
tile
of
the
house
rattle
with
the
storm
:
his
imagination
be
immediately
strike
with
the
idea
of
escape
unperceive
,
amidst
the
darkness
and
noise
of
the
temp
,
by
creep
out
at
the
window
of
his
apartment
,
and
make
his
way
over
the
top
of
the
adjoining
house
.
<EOS>
glow
with
this
prospect
,
he
examine
the
passage
,
which
,
to
his
infinite
mortification
,
he
find
grate
with
iron
-
bar
on
the
outside
;
but
even
this
difficulty
do
not
divert
him
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
conscious
of
his
own
strength
,
he
believe
himself
able
to
make
an
hole
thro
'
the
roof
,
which
seem
to
be
slend
and
crazy
;
and
,
on
this
supposition
,
he
barricado
the
door
with
the
whole
furniture
of
the
room
:
then
,
set
himself
to
work
with
a
poker
,
he
in
a
few
minute
effect
a
passage
for
his
hand
,
with
which
he
gradually
stript
off
the
board
and
tiling
,
so
as
to
open
a
sally
-
port
for
his
whole
body
,
thro
'
which
he
fairly
set
himself
free
,
grope
his
way
towards
the
next
tenement
.
    
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
he
meet
with
an
unlucky
accident
:
his
hat
,
be
blow
off
his
head
,
chance
to
tumble
into
the
court
,
just
as
one
of
the
bailiff
's
follower
be
knock
at
the
door
;
and
this
myrmidon
recognize
it
immediately
,
give
the
alarm
to
his
chief
,
who
,
run
up
stair
to
the
garret
,
force
open
the
door
in
a
twinkling
,
notwithstanding
the
precaution
which
the
prisoner
have
take
,
and
,
with
his
attendant
,
pursue
the
fugitive
thro
'
his
own
track
.
"
<EOS>
after
this
chace
have
continue
some
time
,
(
say
the
officer
)
to
the
imminent
danger
of
all
three
,
I
find
my
progress
suddenly
stopt
by
a
sky
-
light
,
through
which
I
perceive
seven
taylor
,
sit
at
work
upon
a
board
.
<EOS>
without
the
least
hesitation
or
previous
notice
,
I
plunge
among
them
,
with
my
backside
foremost
;
and
,
before
they
could
recollect
themselves
from
the
consternation
occasion
by
such
a
strange
visit
,
tell
them
my
situation
,
and
give
them
to
understand
that
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
number
,
take
the
hint
,
lead
me
instantly
down
stair
,
and
dismiss
me
at
the
street
-
door
;
while
the
bailiff
and
his
follower
,
arrive
at
the
breach
,
be
deter
from
enter
by
the
brother
of
my
deliverer
,
who
present
their
shear
,
like
a
range
of
chevaux
de
frise
,
command
them
to
retire
,
on
pain
of
immediate
death
:
and
the
catchpole
,
rather
than
risque
his
carcase
,
consent
to
discharge
the
debt
,
comfort
himself
with
the
hope
of
make
me
prisoner
again
.
<EOS>
there
,
however
,
he
be
disappoint
:
    
I
keep
snug
,
and
laugh
at
his
escape
-
warrant
,
until
I
be
order
abroad
with
the
regiment
,
when
I
convey'd
myself
in
a
hearse
to
gravesend
,
where
I
embark
for
flander
;
but
,
be
oblige
to
come
over
again
on
the
recruiting
service
,
I
be
nabb'd
on
another
score
:
and
all
the
satisfaction
my
first
captor
have
be
able
to
obtain
,
be
a
writ
of
detainer
;
which
,
I
believe
,
will
fix
me
in
this
place
,
until
the
parliament
,
in
its
great
goodness
,
shall
think
proper
to
discharge
my
debt
,
by
a
new
act
of
insolvency
.
"
    
<EOS>
every
body
own
,
that
the
captain
's
success
be
equal
to
the
hardiness
of
his
enterprize
,
which
be
altogether
in
the
stile
of
a
soldier
:
but
one
of
the
merchant
observe
,
that
he
must
have
be
a
bailiff
of
small
experience
,
who
would
trust
a
prisoner
of
that
consequence
in
such
an

You
may
guess

surprize

I
see

rear
up

declare

I
aim
the

at

,
in

miss
my
mark

before
I
could
repeat
the
blow
,
he
start
up
with
great
agility
,
and
execute
his
office
in
sight
of
several
evidence
,
whom
he
have
assemble
in
the
street
for

purpose
;
so
that
I
could
not
possibly
disentangle
myself
from
the
toil
,
without
incur
an
escape

warrant
,
from
which
I
have
no
protection

<EOS>
but
,
have
I
know
the
content
of
the
chest
,
by
all
that
be
good
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
order
my
porter
to
raise
it
up
,
as
high
as
the
crane
would
permit
,
and
then
have
cut
the
rope
by
accident

"
    
<EOS>
"
that
expedient
,
(
say
the
knight
with
the
red
ribbon
)
would
have
discourage
him
from
such
hazardous
adventure
for
the
future
,

would
have
be
an
example
in
terrorem
of
all
his
brother

<EOS>
the
story
put
me
in
mind
of
a
deliverance
achieve
by
Tom
Hackabout
,
a
very
stout
honest
fellow
,
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
who
have
be
so
famous
for
maim
bailiff
,
that
another
gentleman
have
be
ill
use
at
a
sponging
house
,
no
sooner
obtain
his
liberty
than
,
with
a
view
of
be
revenge
upon
the
landlord
,
he
,
for
five
shilling
,
buy
one
of
Tom
's
note
,
which
sell
at
a
very
large
discount
,
and
take
out
a
writ
upon
it
,
put
it
into
the
hand
of
the
bailiff
who
have
use
him
ill
.
<EOS>
the
catchpole
,
after
a
diligent
search
,
have
an
opportunity
of
execute
the
writ
upon
the
defendant
,
who
,
without
ceremony
,
break
one
of
his
arm
,
fracture
his
skull
,
and
belabour
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
lie
without
sense
and
motion
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
by
such
exploit
,
this
hero
become
so
formidable
,
that
no
single
bailiff
would
undertake
to
arrest
him
;
so
that
he
appear
in
all
public
place
,
untouched
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
several
officer
of
the
Marshalsea
-
court
enter
into
a
confederacy
against
him
;
and
two
of
the
number
,
attend
by
three
desperate
follower
,
venture
to
arrest
him
one
day
in
the
Strand
,
near
Hungerford
-
market
:
he
find
it
impossible
to
make
resistance
,
because
the
whole
gang
spring
upon
him
at
once
,
like
so
many
tyger
,
and
pinion
his
arm
so
fast
,
that
he
could
not
wag
a
finger
.
    
<EOS>
perceive
himself
fairly
overpower
,
he
desire
to
be
conduct
forthwith
to
jail
,
and
be
stow
in
a
boat
accordingly
:
<EOS>
by
that
time
they
have
reach
the
middle
of
the
river
,
he
find
mean
to
overset
the
wherry
by
accident
,
and
every
man
disregard
the
prisoner
,
consult
his
own
safety
.
<EOS>
as
for
Hackabout
,
to
whom
that
element
be
quite
familiar
,
he
mount
astride
upon
the
keel
of
the
boat
,
which
be
uppermost
,
and
exhort
the
bailiff
to
swim
for
their
life
;
protest
,
before
God
,
that
they
have
no
other
chance
to
be
save
.
    
<EOS>
the
waterman
be
immediately
take
up
by
some
of
their
own
friend
,
who
,
far
from
yield
any
assistance
to
the
catch
-
pole
,
keep
aloof
,
and
exult
in
their
calamity
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
two
of
the
five
go
to
the
bottom
,
and
never
see
the
light
of
God
's
sun
,
and
the
other
three
,
with
great
difficulty
,
save
themselves
by
lay
hold
on
the
rudder
of
a
dung
-
barge
,
to
which
they
be
carry
by
the
stream
,
while
Tom
,
with
great
deliberation
,
swam
across
to
the
Surry
shore
.
<EOS>
after
this
atchievement
,
he
be
so
much
dread
by
the
whole
fraternity
,
that
they
shiver
at
the
very
mention
of
his
name
;
and
this
character
,
which
some
people
would
think
an
advantage
to
a
man
in
debt
,
be
the
great
misfortune
that
could
possibly
happen
to
him
;
because
no
tradesman
would
give
him
credit
for
the
least
trifle
,
on
this
supposition
,
that
he
could
not
indemnify
himself
in
the
common
course
of
law

<EOS>
the
parson
do
not
approve
of
Mr
Hackabout
's
method
of
escaping
,
which
he
consider
as
a
very
unchristian
attempt
upon
the
life
of
his
fellow
-
subject
:
    
<EOS>

It
be
enough
(
say
he
)
that
we
elude
the
law
of
our
country

without
murthere

justice

for
my
own
part

I
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
heart
,
and
safely
say
,
that
I
forgive
from
my
soul
the
fellow
by
whom
I
be
make
prisoner
,
although
the
circumstance
of
his
behaviour
be
treacherous

wicked

profane

You
must
know
,
Mr
Pickle

I
be
one
day
call
into
my
chapel

in

join
a

in

of
matrimony

my
affair

so
situate

me
under

venture

come
within

He
be
cloathe
in

trousser

have
such
an

simplicity

divest
me

trust
myself

begin
to
exercise
the
duty

upon

have
obtain

permission

bring

up

Chapter
CVI
   
<EOS>
the
knight
have
scarce
finish
this
narrative
,
when
our
hero
be
tell
,
that
a
gentleman
in

coffee

room
want
to
see

all

accord
to
the
determination
of

precede

now
give

an
account
of
the
remark
he
have
over

hear
on

misfortune

public

extraordinary

evening
discourse
upon
at
several
tea
and
card

table
,
with
this
variation
from
the
truth
,
that
the
debt
amount
to
twelve
thousand
,
instead
of
twelve
hundred
pound

from
which
circumstance
it
be
conjecture

that
Peregrine
be
a
bite
from
the
beginning

who
have
find
credit
on

effrontery

himself
upon

of
fortune

rejoice

at
his
calamity

which
they
consider
as
a
just
punishment
for
his
fraud

begin
to
review
certain
particular
of
his
conduct

that
plainly
demonstrate
him
to
be

rank
adventurer

long
before

than
the
communicative

desire
his
company
to
take
particular
notice

this
person

whom
he
have
pay
his
respect

"
that
man
(
say
he

be
this
day
one
of
the
most
flagrant
instance
of
neglect
virtue

over
and
above
a
cool
,
discerning
head

fraught
with
uncommon
learning
and
experience

he
be
possess
of
such
fortitude
and
resolution
,
as
no
difficulty
can
discourage
,
and
no
danger
impair
;
and
so
indefatigable
be
his
humanity
,
that
even
now
,
while
he
be
surround
with
such
embarassment
,
as
would
distract
the
brain
of
any
ordinary
mortal
,
he
have
add
considerably
to
his
incumbrance
,
by
take
under
his
protection
that
young
gentleman
,
who
,
induce
by
his
character
,
appeal
to
his
benevolence
for
redress
of
the
grievance
under
which
he
labour
from
the
villainy
of
his
guardian

"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
curiosity
be
excite
by
this
encomium
<EOS>
,
he
ask
the
name
of
this
generous
patron
,
of
which
when
he
be
inform
,
"
I
be
no
stranger
(
say
he
)
to
the
fame
of
that
gentleman
,
who
have
make
a
considerable
noise
in
the
world
,
on
account
of
<EOS>
that
great
cause
he
undertake
in
defence
of
an
unhappy
orphan
;
and
since
he
be
a
person
of
such
an
amiable
disposition
,
I
be
heartily
sorry
to
find
that
his
endeavour
have
not
meet
with
that
successful
issue
which
their
good
fortune
in
the
beginning
seem
to
promise
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
circumstance
of
his
espousing
that
cause
be
so
uncommon
and
romantic
,
and
the
depravity
of
the
human
heart
so
universal
,
that
some
people
,
unacquainted
with
his
real
character
,
imagine
his
view
be
altogether
selfish
;
and
some
be
not
want
,
who
affirm
he
be
a
mere
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
own
,
I
have
hear
some
of
the
most
virulent
of
those
who
be
concern
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
,
bear
testimony
in
his
favour

observe
,
that
he
be
deceive
into
the
expence
of
the
whole
,
by
the
plausible
story
which
at
first
engage
his
compassion
.
<EOS>
Your
description
of
his
character
confirm
me
in
the
same
opinion
;
though
I
be
quite
ignorant
of
the
affair
,
the
particular
of
which
I
should
be
glad
to
learn
,
as
well
as
a
genuine
account
of
his
own
life
,
many
circumstance
of
which
be
by
his
enemy
,
I
believe
,
egregiously
misrepresented

with
a

of

<EOS>
He
offer
his
service
to
several
officer
,
in
hope
of
be
inliste
in
their
company

but
they
would
not

because
they
rightly
conclude
that
he
be
some
school

boy
break
loose
,
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
his
relation
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
discouragement
,
he
continue
in
camp
,
curiously
pry
into
every
part
of
the
service
;
and
such
be
the
resolution
conspicuous
in
him
,
even
at
such
a
tender
age
,
that
after
his
small
finance
be
exhaust
,
he
persist
in
his
design
;
and
,
because
he
would
not
make
his
want
know
,
actually
subsist
for
several
day
on
hip
,
haw
and
sloe
,
and
other
spontaneous
fruit
which
he
gather
in
the
wood
and
field

<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while

he
never
fail
to
be
present

when

by

the
company

<EOS>
this
eagerness
and
perseverance
attract
the
notice
of
many
officer
,
who
after
have
commend
his
spirit
and
zeal
,
press
him
to
return

his

and
even
threaten
to
expel
him
from
the
camp
,
if
he
would
not
comply
with
their
advice

<EOS>
these
remonstrance
have
no
other
effect
than
that
of
warn
him
to
avoid
his
monitor

they
think
proper
to
alter
their
behaviour
towards

take
him
into

He
temporize
with

fear
that
should

seem
refractory
,
the
captain
would
have
order
him
to
be
shut
up
in
the
castle
;
and
inflame
with
the
desire
of
see
a
battle
,
no
sooner
see
his
relation
march
off
the
ground
,
than
he
mix
in
with
another
regiment

to
which
his
former

a
more
solid
and
profitable
course

<EOS>
so
inordinate
be
his
desire
of
make
speedy
advance
in
the
path
of
learning
,
that
within
the
compass
of
three
month

He

make
such
progress
in

he
resolve
to
qualify

for
the
church
,
and
acquire
such
a
stock
of
school
divinity
under
the
instruction
of
a
learned
professor
at
Edinburgh
,
that
he
more
than
once
mount
the
rostrum
,
in
the
public
hall
,
and
hold
forth
with
uncommon
applause
:
but
be
discourage
from
a
prosecution
of
his
plan
,
by
the
unreasonable
austerity
of
some
of
the
Scotch
clergy
,
by
whom
,
the
most
indifferent
and
innocent
word
and
action
,
be
often
misconstrue
into
levity
and
misconduct

he
resolve
to
embrace
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
go
abroad
,
be
enflame
with
the
desire

with

under

<EOS>
have
thus
finish
his
school
education
,
he
set
out
for
Paris
,
with
a
view
to
make
himself
perfect
in
the
french
language
,
and
learn
such
useful
exercise
,
as
may
be
acquire
with
the
wretched
remnant
of
his
slender
estate
,
which
be
by
that
time
reduce
very
low
.
<EOS>
in
his
journey
through
the
Netherlands
,
he
go
to
Namure
,
and
pay
his
respect
to
bishop
Strickland
and
general
Collier
,
by
whom
we
be
receive
with
great
civility
,
in
consequence
of
letter
of
recommendation
,
with
which
he
be
provide
from
the
Hague
,
and
the
old
general
assure
him
of
his
protection
and
interest
for
a
pair
of
colour
,
if
he
be
dispose
to
enter
into
the
Dutch
Service
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
he
be
by
that
time
,
pretty
well
cure
of
his
military
Don
Quixotism
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
totally
decline
the
generous
proffer
,
for
which
he
thank
him
in
the
most
grateful
term
,
tell
the
general
that
he
would
pay
his
duty
to
him
on
his
return
from
France
,
and
then
,
if
he
could
determine
upon
return
to
the
army
,
should
think
himself
highly
honour
in
be
under
his
command
.
    
<EOS>
after
a
stay
of
two
month
in
flander
,
he
proceed
to
Paris
,
and
far
from
take
up
his
habitation
in
the
suburb
of
St
Germain
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
english
traveller
,
he
hire
a
private
lodging
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
and
associate
chiefly
with
french
officer
,
who
(
their
youthful
sally
be
over
)
be
allow
to
be
the
polite
gentleman
of
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
in
this
scheme
he
find
his
account
so
much
,
that
he
could
not
but
wonder
at
the
folly
of
his
countryman
,
who
lose
the
main
scope
of
their
go
abroad
,
by
spend
their
time
and
fortune
idly
with
one
another
.
    
<EOS>
during
his
residence
in
Holland
,
he
have
make
himself
acquaint
with
the
good
author
in
the
french
language
,
so
that
he
be
able
to
share
in
their
conversation
;
a
circumstance
from
which
he
find
great
benefit
;
for
,
it
not
only
improve
him
in
his
knowledge
of
that
tongue
,
but
also
tend
to
the
enlargement
of
his
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
he
contract
intimacy
in
some
family
of
good
fashion
,
especially
those
of
the
long
robe
,
which
would
have
enable
him
to
pass
his
time
very
agreeably
,
have
he
be
a
little
easy
in
point
of
fortune
:
but
his
finance
,
notwithstanding
the
most
rigid
oeconomy
,
be
,
in
a
few
month
,
reduce
to
a
very
low
ebb
,
the
prospect
of
indigence
throw
a
damp
upon
all
his
pleasure
<EOS>
,
tho
'
he
never
suffer
himself
to
be
thereby
,
in
any
degree
,
dispirit
;
be
in
that
respect
,
of
so
happy
<EOS>
a
disposition
,
that
conscious
poverty
or
abundance
make
very
slight
impression
upon
his
mind
.
    
<EOS>
this
consumption
of
his
cash
,
however
,
involve
him
in
some
perplexity
;
and
he
deliberate
with
himself
whether
he
should
return
to
general
Collier
,
or
repair
to
London
,
where
he
may
possibly
fall
into
some
business
not
unbecome
a
gentleman
;
tho
'
he
be
very
much
mortify
to
find
himself
incapable
of
gratify
an
inordinate
desire
which
possess
him
of
make
the
grand
tour
,
or
at
least
,
of
visit
the
southern
part
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
hesitate
between
different
suggestion
,
he
be
one
morning
,
visit
by
a
gentleman
who
have
seek
and
cultivate
his
friendship
,
and
for
whom
he
have
do
a
good
office
,
in
support
him
with
spirit
,
against
a
brutal
German
,
with
whom
he
have
an
affair
of
honour
.
    
<EOS>
this
gentleman
come
to
propose
a
party
for
a
fortnight
,
to
Fontainbleau
,
where
the
court
then

the
proposal

than

very
urgent

know
the

My

I

you
my

even
now

it

that

of

<EOS>
that
worthy

by

too
much
confidence
in
a
villanous
lawyer

and
a
chain
of
other
misfortune

by
the
generosity
of
his

resolve
to
execute
his
former
plan
of
see
the
south
of
France
,
together
with
the
seaport
of
Spain
,
as
far
as
Cadiz
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
propose
to
take
a
passage
for
London
by
sea
,
and
with
this
view
,
send
forwards
his
trunk
by
the
diligence
to
Lyons
,
determine
to
ride
post
,
in
order
to
enjoy
a
well
view
of
the
country
,
and
for
the
conveniency
of
stop
at
those
place
where
there
be
any
thing
remarkable
to
be
see
or
enquire
into
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
employ
in
take
leave
of
his
parisian
friend
,
who
furnish
him
with
abundant
recommendation
,
a
gentleman
of
his
own
country
,
who
speak
little
or
no
French
,
hear
of
his
intention
,
beg
the
favour
of
accompany
him
in
his
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
new
companion
,
therefore
,
he
set
out
for
Lyons
,
where
he
be
perfectly
well
receive
by
the
intendant
and
some
of
the
good
family
of
the
place
,
in
consequence
of
his
letter
of
recommendation
;
and
after
a
short
stay
in
that
city
,
proceed
down
the
Rhone
,
to
Avignon
,
in
what
be
call
the
coche
d'eau
;
then
visit
the
principal
town
of
Dauphine
,
Languedoc
and
Provence
,
he
return
to
the
delightful
city
of
Marseilles
,
where
he
and
his
fellow
traveller
be
so
much
captivate
by
the
serenity
of
the
air
,
the
good
nature
and
hospitality
of
the
sprightly
inhabitant
,
that
they
never
dream
of
change
their
quarter
,
during
the
whole
winter
,
and
part
of
the
spring
:
    
<EOS>
here
he
acquire
the
acquaintance
of
the
marquis
D'Argens
,
attorney
-
general
in
the
parliament
of
Aix
,
and
of
his
eld
son
,
who
now
make
so
great
a
figure
in
the
literary
world
;
and
when
the
affair
of
father
Girard
and
madamoiselle
Cadiere
begin
to
make
a
noise
,
he
accompany
these
two
gentleman
to
Toulon
,
where
the
marquis
be
order
to
take
precognition
of
the
fact
.
    
<EOS>
on
his
return
to
Marseilles
,
he
find
a
certain
noble
lord
of
great
fortune
,
under
the
direction
of
a
swiss
governor
,
who
have
accommodate
him
with
two
of
his
own
relation
,
of
the
same
country
,
by
way
of
companion
,
together
with
five
servant
in
his
train
.
<EOS>
They
be
absolute
stranger
in
the
place
,
M
#
#
#
#
introduce
them
to
the
intendant
,
and
several
other
good
family
;
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
so
agreeable
to
his
lordship
,
that
he
propose
,
and
even
press
him
to
live
with
him
in
England
,
as
a
friend
and
companion
;
and
to
take
upon
him
the
superintendance
of
his
affair
,
in
which
case
,
he
would
settle
upon
him
four
hundred
a
year
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
too
advantageous
to
be
slight
by
a
person
of
no
fortune
,
or
fix
establishment
;
he
,
therefore
,
make
no
difficulty
of
close
with
it
:
but
as
his
lordship
's
departure
be
fix
to
a
short
day
,
and
he
urge
him
to
accompany
him
to
Paris
,
and
from
thence
to
England
,
M
#
#
#
#
think
it
would
be
improper
and
indecent
to
interfere
with
the
office
of
his
governor
,
who
may
take
umbrage
at
his
favour
,
and
therefore
excuse
himself
from
a
compliance
with
his
lordship
's
request
,
until
his
minority
should
be
expire
,
as
he
be
within
a
few
month
of
be
of
age
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
he
repeat
his
importunity
so
earnestly
,
and
the
governor
join
in
the
request
,
with
such
appearance
of
cordiality
,
that
he
be
prevail
upon
to
comply
with
their
joint
desire
;
and
,
in
a
few
day
,
set
out
with
them
for
Paris
,
by
the
way
of
Lyons
.
<EOS>
but
before
they
have
be
three
day
in
this
city
,
M
#
#
#
#
perceive
a
total
change
in
the
behaviour
of
the
Swiss
and
his
two
relation
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
become
jealous
of
his
influence
with
his
lordship
;
and
he
no
sooner
make
this
discovery
,
than
he
resolve
to
withdraw
himself
from
such
a
disagreeable
participation
of
that
young
nobleman
's
favour
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
in
spite
of
all
his
lordship
's
intreatie
and
remonstrance
,
quit
him
for
the
present
;
alledging
,
as
a
pretext
,
that
he
have
a
longing
desire
to
see
Switzerland
and
the
bank
of
the
Rhine
,
and
promise
to
meet
him
again
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
this
his
intention
be
make
known
to
the
governor
and
his
friend
,
their
countenance
immediately
clear
up
,
their
courtesy
and
complaisance
return
,
and
they
even
furnish
him
with
letter
for
Geneva
,
Lausane
,
Bern
,
and
Soleures
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
meet
with
unusual
civility
at
these
place
.
<EOS>
have
make
this
tour
with
his
Scotch
friend
,
(
who
come
up
to
him
before
he
leave
Lyons
)
and
visit
the
most
considerable
town
on
both
side
of
the
Rhine
,
and
the
court
of
the
Electors
Palatine
,
Mentz
,
and
Cologn
,
he
arrive
in
Holland
;
and
from
thence
,
thro
'
the
Netherlands
,
repair
to
London
,
where
he
find
my
lord
just
return
from
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
receive
him
with
expression
of
uncommon
joy
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
stir
from
him
for
several
day
,
and
introduce
him
to
his
relation
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
accompany
his
lordship
from
London
to
his
country
-
seat
,
where
he
be
indeed
treat
with
great
friendship
and
confidence
,
and
consult
in
every
thing
;
but
the
noble
peer
never
once
make
mention
of
the
annuity
which
he
have
promise
to
settle
upon
him
;
nor
do
M
#
#
#
#
remind
him
of
it
,
because
he
conceive
<EOS>
it
be
his
affair
to
fulfil
his
engagement
of
his
own
accord
.
<EOS>
w
#
#
#
#
be
tired
of
the
manner
of
live
at
this
place
,
make
an
excursion
to
Bath
,
where
he
staid
about
a
fortnight
,
to
partake
of
the
diversion
;
and
,
upon
his
return
,
find
his
lordship
make
disposition
for
another
journey
to
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
sudden
resolution
,
he
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
from
it
;
but
his
remonstrance
be
render
ineffectual
by
the
insinuation
of
a
foreigner
,
who
have
come
over
with
him
,
and
fill
his
imagination
with
extravagant
notion
of
pleasure
,
infinitely
superior
to
any
which
he
could
enjoy
while
he
be
in
the
trammel
,
and
under
the
restraint
of
a
governor
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
M
#
#
#
#
's
argument
,
and
intreate
him
to
accompany
him
in
the
journey
:
but
this
gentleman
,
foresee
that
a
young
man
,
like
my
lord
,
of
strong
passion
,
and
easy
to
be
mislead
,
would
,
in
all
probability
,
squander
away
great
sum
of
money
,
in
a
way
that
would
neither
do
credit
to
himself
,
or
to
those
who
be
concerned
with
him
,
resist
all
his
solicitation
,
on
pretence
of
have
business
of
consequence
at
London
;
and
afterwards
have
reason
to
be
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
own
conduct
in
this
particular
.
    
<EOS>
before
he
set
out
on
this
expedition
,
M
#
#
#
#
,
in
justice
to
himself
,
remind
him
of
the
proposal
which
he
have
make
to
him
at
Marseilles
,
desire
to
know
if
he
have
alter
his
design
in
that
particular
;
in
which
case
,
he
would
turn
his
thought
some
other
way
;
as
he
would
not
in
the
least
be
think
to
intrude
or
pin
himself
upon
any
man
.
<EOS>
My
lord
protest
,
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
he
still
continue
in
his
former
resolution
;
and
again
beseech
him
to
bear
him
company
into
France
,
promise
that
every
thing
should
be
settle
to
his
satisfaction
,
upon
their
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
,
however
,
still
persist
in
his
refusal
,
for
the
abovementioned
reason
:
and
tho
<EOS>
'
he
never
hear
more
of
the
annuity
<EOS>
,
he
nevertheless
continue
to
serve
his
lordship
with
his
advice
and
good
office
ever
after
;
particularly
in
direct
his
choice
to
an
alliance
with
a
lady
of
eminent
virtue
,
the
daughter
of
a
noble
lord
,
more
conspicuous
for
his
shine
part
than
the
splendor
of
his
title
,
(
a
circumstance
upon
which
he
always
reflect
with
particular
satisfaction
,
as
well
on
account
of
the
extraordinary
merit
of
the
lady
,
as
because
it
vest
in
her
child
a
considerable
part
of
that
great
estate
,
which
,
of
right
,
belong
to
her
grandmother
)
and
afterwards
put
him
in
a
way
to
retrieve
his
estate
from
a
heavy
load
of
debt
he
have
contract
.
<EOS>
when
my
lord
set
out
on
his
Paris
expedition
,
the
money
M
#
#
#
#
have
receive
from
his
generous
friend
at
Paris
be
almost
reduce
to
the
last
guinea
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
yet
reap
the
least
benefit
from
his
engagement
with
his
lordship
;
and
disdain
to
ask
for
a
supply
from
him
,
he
know
not
how
to
subsist
,
with
any
degree
of
credit
,
'
till
his
return
.
    
<EOS>
this
uncomfortable
prospect
be
the
more
disagreeable
to
him
,
as
,
at
that
time
of
life
,
he
be
much
inclined
to
appear
in
the
gay
world
,
have
contract
a
taste
for
play
,
opera
's
,
and
other
public
diversion
,
and
acquire
an
acquaintance
with
many
people
of
good
fashion
,
which
could
not
be
maintain
without
a
considerable
expence
.
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
,
he
think
he
could
not
employ
his
idle
time
more
profitably
than
in
translating
,
from
foreign
language
,
such
book
as
be
then
chiefly
in
vogue
;
and
upon
application
to
a
friend
,
who
be
a
man
of
letter
,
he
be
furnish
with
as
much
business
of
that
kind
as
he
could
possibly
manage
,
and
write
some
pamphlet
on
the
reign
controversy
of
that
time
,
that
have
the
good
fortune
to
please
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
concern
in
a
monthly
journal
of
literature
,
and
the
work
be
carry
on
by
the
two
friend
jointly
,
tho
'
M
#
#
#
#
do
not
at
all
appear
in
the
partnership
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
he
not
only
spend
his
morning
in
useful
exercise
,
but
supply
himself
with
money
for
what
the
French
call
the
menus
plaisir
,
during
the
whole
summer
.
<EOS>
He
frequent
all
the
assembly
in
and
about
London
,
and
considerably
enlarge
his
acquaintance
among
the
fair
sex
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
,
upon
his
first
arrival
in
England
,
become
acquainted
with
a
lady
at
an
assembly
not
far
from
London
;
and
tho
'
,
at
that
time
,
he
have
no
thought
of
extend
his
view
farther
than
the
usual
gallantry
of
the
place
,
he
meet
with
such
distinguish
mark
of
her
regard
in
the
sequel
,
and
be
so
particularly
encourage
by
the
advice
of
another
lady
,
with
whom
he
have
be
intimate
in
France
,
and
who
be
now
of
their
party
,
that
he
could
not
help
entertain
hope
of
make
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
his
agreeable
partner
,
who
be
a
young
lady
of
an
ample
fortune
,
and
great
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
cultivate
her
good
grace
with
all
the
assiduity
and
address
of
which
he
be
master
;
and
succeed
so
well
in
his
endeavour
,
that
after
a
due
course
of
attendance
,
and
the
death
of
an
aunt
,
by
which
she
receive
an
accession
of
fortune
,
to
the
amount
of
three
and
twenty
thousand
pound
,
he
venture
to
declare
his
passion
,
and
she
not
only
hear
him
with
patience
and
approbation
,
but
also
reply
in
term
adequate
to
his
warm
wish
.
    
<EOS>
find
himself
so
favourably
receive
,
he
press
her
to
secure
his
happiness
by
marriage
;
but
,
to
this
proposal
,
she
object
the
recency
of
her
kinswoman
's
death
,
which
would
have
render
such
a
step
highly
indecent
,
and
the
displeasure
of
her
other
relation
,
from
whom
she
have
still
great
expectation
,
and
who
at
that
time
importune
her
to
marry
a
cousin
of
her
own
,
whom
she
could
not
like
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
M
#
#
#
#
may
have
no
cause
to
repine
at
her
delay
,
she
freely
enter
with
him
into
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
;
during
which
,
nothing
could
have
add
to
their
mutual
felicity
,
which
be
the
more
poignant
and
refined
,
from
the
mysterious
and
romantic
manner
of
their
enjoy
it
;
for
,
tho
'
he
publickly
visit
her
as
an
acquaintance
,
<EOS>
his
behaviour
,
on
these
occasion
,
be
always
so
distant
,
respectful
,
and
reserve
,
that
the
rest
of
the
company
could
not
possibly
suspect
the
nature
of
their
reciprocal
attachment
:
in
consequence
of
which
,
they
use
to
have
private
interview
,
unknown
to
every
soul
upon
earth
,
except
her
maid
,
who
be
necessarily
intrust
with
the
secret
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
manner
they
enjoy
the
conversation
of
each
other
for
above
twelve
month
,
without
the
least
interruption
;
and
tho
'
the
stability
of
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
's
fortune
intirely
depend
upon
their
marriage
,
yet
as
he
perceive
his
mistress
so
averse
to
it
,
he
never
urge
it
with
vehemence
,
nor
be
at
all
anxious
on
that
score
;
be
easily
induce
to
defer
a
ceremony
which
,
as
he
then
think
,
could
in
no
shape
have
add
to
their
satisfaction
,
tho
'
he
hath
since
alter
his
sentiment
.
    
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
his
indulgent
mistress
,
in
order
to
set
his
mind
at
ease
in
that
particular
,
and
in
full
confidence
of
his
honour
,
insist
on
his
accept
a
deed
of
gift
of
her
whole
fortune
,
in
consideration
of
their
intend
marriage
;
and
after
some
difficulty
,
he
be
prevail
upon
to
receive
this
proof
of
her
esteem
,
well
know
that
it
would
still
be
in
his
power
to
return
the
obligation
.
<EOS>
tho
'
she
often
intreate
him
to
take
upon
himself
the
intire
administration
of
her
finance
,
and
upon
diver
occasion
press
him
to
accept
of
large
sum
,
he
never
once
abuse
her
generous
disposition
,
or
solicit
her
for
money
,
except
for
some
humane
purpose
,
which
she
be
always
more
ready
to
fulfil
than
he
to
propose
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
correspondence
,
he
become
acquaint
with
some
of
her
female
relation
;
and
,
among
the
rest
,
with
a
young
lady
,
so
eminently
adorn
with
all
the
qualification
of
mind
and
person
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
his
philosophy
and
caution
,
he
could
not
behold
and
converse
with
her
,
without
be
deeply
smitten
with
her
charm
.
    
<EOS>
He
do
all
in
his
power
to
discourage
this
dangerous
invasion
in
the
beginning
,
and
to
conceal
the
least
symptom
of
it
from
her
relation
:
he
summon
all
his
reflection
to
his
aid
;
and
think
it
would
be
base
and
dishonest
to
cherish
any
sentiment
,
repugnant
to
the
affection
which
he
owe
to
a
mistress
,
who
have
place
such
unlimited
confidence
in
him
<EOS>
,
he
attempt
to
stifle
the
infant
flame
by
avoid
the
amiable
inspirer
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
passion
have
take
too
deep
a
root
in
his
heart
,
to
be
so
easily
extirpate
:
his
absence
from
the
dear
object
,
increase
the
impatience
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
the
intestine
conflict
between
that
and
gratitude
,
deprive
him
of
his
rest
and
appetite
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
a
short
time
,
emaciate
by
continual
watching
,
anxiety
,
and
want
of
nourishment
;
and
so
much
alter
from
his
usual
chearfulness
,
that
his
mistress
be
surprise
and
alarm
at
the
change
,
which
,
from
the
symptom
,
she
judge
be
owe
to
some
uneasiness
of
mind
,
take
all
imaginable
pain
to
discover
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
it
do
not
escape
her
penetration
;
for
she
,
more
than
once
,
ask
if
he
be
in
love
with
her
cousin
;
protest
that
,
far
from
be
an
obstacle
to
his
happiness
,
she
would
,
in
that
case
,
be
an
advocate
for
his
passion
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
declaration
be
never
make
without
manifest
sign
of
anxiety
and
uneasiness
,
which
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
M
#
#
#
#
,
that
he
resolve
to
sacrifice
his
happiness
,
and
even
his
life
,
rather
than
take
any
step
which
may
be
construe
into
an
injury
or
insult
to
a
person
who
have
treat
him
with
such
generosity
and
goodness
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
resolution
,
he
form
another
which
be
to
go
abroad
,
under
pretence
of
recover
his
health
,
but
in
reality
,
to
avoid
the
temptation
,
as
well
as
the
suspicion
of
be
inconstant
;
and
in
this
design
he
be
confirm
by
his
physician
,
who
actually
think
him
in
the
first
stage
of
a
consumption
,
and
therefore
advise
him
to
repair
to
the
south
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
He
communicate
his
design
,
with
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
to
the
lady
,
who
agree
to
it
with
much
less
difficulty
than
he
find
in
conquer
his
own
reluctance
,
at
part
with
the
dear
object
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
the
consent
of
his
generous
mistress
be
obtain
,
he
wait
upon
her
with
the
instrument
whereby
she
have
make
the
conveyance
of
her
fortune
to
him
;
and
all
his
remonstrance
be
insufficient
to
persuade
her
to
take
it
back
,
he
cancel
it
in
her
presence
,
and
place
it
in
that
state
,
upon
her
toilet
,
while
she
be
dress
;
whereupon
she
shed
a
torrent
of
tear
,
say
she
now
plainly
perceive
that
he
want
to
tear
himself
from
her
,
and
that
his
affection
be
settle
upon
another
.
<EOS>
He
be
sensibly
affect
by
this
proof
of
her
concern
;
and
endeavour
to
calm
the
perturbation
of
her
mind
,
by
vow
eternal
fidelity
,
and
press
her
to
accept
of
his
hand
in
due
form
,
before
his
departure
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
her
transport
be
quiet
for
the
present
,
and
the
marriage
defer
,
for
the
same
prudential
reason
which
have
hitherto
prevent
it
.
    
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
compromise
,
and
the
day
fix
for
his
departure
,
she
,
together
with
her
faithful
maid
,
one
morning
visit
him
for
the
first
time
at
his
own
lodging
;
and
after
breakfast
,
desire
to
speak
with
him
in
private
,
he
conduct
her
into
another
room
,
where
assume
an
unusual
gravity
of
aspect
,
"
My
dear
M
#
#
#
#
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
you
be
now
go
to
leave
me
,
and
God
alone
know
if
ever
we
shall
meet
again
:
therefore
,
if
you
really
love
me
with
that
tenderness
which
you
profess
,
you
will
accept
of
this
mark
of
my
friendship
and
unalterable
affection
:
it
will
at
least
be
a
provision
for
your
journey
;
and
if
any
accident
should
befal
me
,
before
I
have
the
happiness
of
receive
you
again
into
my
arm
,
I
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
you
be
not
altogether
without
resource
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
put
an
embroidered
pocket
-
book
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
express
the
high
sense
he
have
of
her
generosity
and
affection
in
the
most
pathetic
term
,
and
begg'd
leave
to
suspend
his
acceptance
,
until
he
should
know
the
content
of
her
present
,
which
be
so
extraordinary
,
that
he
absolutely
refuse
to
receive
it
:
he
be
,
however
,
by
her
repeat
intreatie
,
in
a
manner
compel
to
receive
about
one
half
,
and
she
afterwards
insist
upon
his
take
a
reinforcement
of
a
considerable
sum
for
the
expence
of
his
journey
.
    
<EOS>
have
stay
with
her
ten
day
beyond
the
time
he
have
fix
for
his
departure
,
and
settle
the
method
of
their
correspondence
,
he
take
his
leave
with
an
heart
full
of
sorrow
,
anxiety
and
distraction
,
produce
from
the
different
suggestion
of
his
duty
and
love
.
<EOS>
He
then
set
out
for
France
,
and
after
a
short
stay
at
Paris
,
proceed
for
Aix
in
Provence
,
and
from
thence
to
Marseilles
,
at
which
two
place
he
continue
for
some
month
:
but
nothing
he
meet
with
be
able
to
dissipate
those
melancholy
idea
which
still
prey
upon
his
imagination
,
and
affect
his
spirit
,
he
endeavour
to
elude
them
with
a
succession
of
new
object
;
and
with
that
view
,
persuade
a
counsellor
of
the
parliament
of
Aix
,
a
man
of
great
worth
,
learning
and
good
humour
,
to
accompany
him
,
in
make
a
tour
of
those
part
of
France
which
he
have
not
yet
see
.
    
<EOS>
on
their
return
from
this
excursion
,
they
find
at
Aix
an
Italian
Abbe
,
a
person
of
character
,
and
great
knowledge
of
man
and
book
,
who
have
travel
all
over
Germany
and
France
,
be
so
far
on
his
return
to
his
own
country
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
have
,
by
mean
of
his
friend
the
counsellor
,
contract
an
acquaintance
with
this
gentleman
,
and
be
desirous
of
see
some
part
of
Italy
,
particularly
the
carnival
at
Venice
,
they
set
out
together
from
Marseilles
,
in
a
tartan
,
for
Genoa
,
coast
it
all
the
way
,
and
lie
on
shore
every
night
.
<EOS>
have
shew
him
what
be
most
remarkable
in
this
city
,
his
friend
the
Abbe
be
so
obliging
,
as
to
conduct
him
thro
'
Tuscany
,
and
the
most
remarkable
city
in
Lombardy
,
to
Venice
,
where
M
#
#
#
#
insist
upon
defray
the
expence
of
the
whole
tour
,
in
consideration
of
the
Abbe
's
complaisance
,
which
have
be
of
infinite
service
to
him
,
in
the
course
of
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
have
remain
five
week
at
Venice
,
he
be
prepare
to
set
out
for
Rome
with
some
english
gentleman
whom
he
have
meet
by
accident
,
when
he
be
all
of
a
sudden
oblige
to
change
his
resolution
,
by
some
disagreeable
letter
which
he
receive
from
London
.
<EOS>
Ye
have
,
from
his
first
departure
,
correspond
with
his
generous
,
though
inconstant
mistress
,
with
a
religious
exactness
and
punctuality
;
nor
be
she
,
for
some
time
,
less
observant
of
the
agreement
they
have
make
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
,
by
degree
,
become
so
negligent
and
cold
in
her
expression
,
and
so
slack
in
her
correspondence
,
that
he
could
not
help
observe
and
upbraid
her
with
such
indifference
;
and
her
endeavour
to
palliate
it
be
support
by
pretext
so
frivolous
,
as
to
be
easily
see
through
by
a
lover
of
very
little
discernment
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
torture
himself
with
conjecture
about
the
cause
of
this
unexpected
change
,
he
receive
such
intelligence
from
England
,
as
,
when
join
with
what
he
himself
have
perceive
,
by
her
manner
of
writing
,
leave
him
little
or
no
room
to
doubt
of
her
fickleness
and
inconstancy
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
as
he
know
by
experience
,
that
information
of
that
kind
be
not
to
be
intirely
relied
upon
,
he
resolve
to
be
more
certainly
apprize
;
and
for
that
end
,
depart
immediately
for
London
,
by
the
way
of
Tirol
,
Bavaria
,
Alsace
and
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
on
his
arrival
in
England
,
he
learn
with
infinite
concern
,
that
his
intelligence
have
not
be
at
all
exaggerate
;
and
his
sorrow
be
inexpressible
,
to
find
a
person
,
endow
with
so
many
other
noble
and
amiable
quality
seduce
into
an
indiscretion
,
that
,
of
necessity
,
must
ruin
the
whole
plan
which
have
be
concert
between
them
for
their
mutual
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
make
several
attempt
,
by
letter
and
interview
,
to
palliate
her
conduct
,
and
soften
him
into
a
reconciliation
;
but
his
honour
be
concern
,
he
remain
deaf
to
all
her
intreatie
and
proposal
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
have
often
hear
him
say
,
that
he
could
not
help
love
her
,
and
revere
the
memory
of
a
person
to
whose
generosity
and
goodness
he
owe
his
fortune
,
and
one
whose
foible
be
over
balance
by
a
thousand
good
quality
.
<EOS>
He
often
insist
on
a
restitution
;
but
,
far
from
comply
with
that
proposal
,
she
hath
afterwards
often
endeavour
to
lay
him
under
yet
great
obligation
of
the
same
kind
,
and
importune
him
,
with
the
warm
solicitation
,
to
renew
their
former
correspondence
,
which
he
as
often
decline
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
take
this
instance
of
the
inconstancy
of
the
sex
so
much
to
heart
,
that
he
have
almost
resolve
,
for
the
future
,
to
keep
clear
of
all
engagement
for
life
,
and
return
to
Paris
,
in
order
to
dissipate
his
anxiety
,
where
he
hire
an
apartment
in
one
of
the
academy
in
the
exercise
<EOS>
whereof
he
take
singular
delight
.
<EOS>
during
his
residence
at
this
place
,
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
ingratiate
himself
with
a
great
general
,
a
descendant
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
illustrious
family
in
France
;
have
attract
his
notice
by
some
remark
he
have
write
on
Folard
's
Polybius
,
which
be
accidentally
shew
to
that
great
man
by
one
of
his
aids
du
camp
,
who
be
a
particular
friend
of
M
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
the
favour
he
have
thus
acquire
,
be
strengthen
by
his
assiduity
and
attention
.
<EOS>
upon
his
return
to
London
,
he
send
some
of
Handel
's
new
composition
to
the
prince
,
who
be
particularly
fond
of
that
gentleman
's
production
;
together
with
Clark
's
edition
of
Caesar
;
and
in
the
spring
of
the
same
year
,
before
the
french
army
take
the
field
,
he
be
honour
with
a
most
obliging
letter
from
the
prince
,
invite
him
to
come
over
,
if
he
want
to
see
the
operation
of
the
campaign
,
and
desire
he
would
give
himself
no
trouble
about
his
equipage
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
have
still
some
remain
of
a
military
disposition
,
and
conceive
this
to
be
a
more
favourable
opportunity
than
any
he
should
ever
meet
with
again
,
readily
embrace
the
offer
,
and
sacrifice
the
soft
delight
of
love
,
which
at
that
time
he
enjoy
without
controul
,
to
an
eager
,
laborious
and
dangerous
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
in
that
and
the
follow
campaign
,
during
which
he
be
present
at
the
siege
of
Philipsburg
,
and
several
other
action
,
he
enlarge
his
acquaintance
among
the
french
officer
,
especially
those
of
the
graver
sort
,
who
have
a
taste
for
book
and
literature
;
and
the
friendship
and
interest
of
those
gentleman
be
afterwards
of
singular
service
to
him
,
tho
'
in
an
affair
altogether
foreign
from
their
profession
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
all
along
make
diligent
inquiry
into
the
trade
and
manufacture
of
the
country
through
which
he
have
occasion
to
travel
,
more
particularly
those
of
Holland
,
England
and
France
;
and
as
he
be
well
acquaint
with
the
revenue
and
farm
of
this
last
kingdom
,
he
see
with
concern
the
great
disadvantage
under
which
our
tobacco
-
trade
(
the
most
considerable
branch
of
our
commerce
with
that
people
)
be
carry
on
;
what
inconsiderable
return
be
make
to
the
planter
,
out
of
the
low
price
give
by
the
french
company
;
and
how
much
it
be
in
the
power
of
that
company
to
reduce
it
still
low
.
<EOS>
M

have
form
a
scheme
to
remedy

He
demonstrate
to
the
ministry
of
that
time

that
so
inconsiderable
a
duty
could
not
in
the

diminish
the
demand
from
abroad
,
which
be
the
only
circumstance
to

apprehend

that
the

amount
to
one
hundred

twenty
thousand

without
one
shill
additional
expence

<EOS>
but
the

have
the

he
renew
his

<EOS>
His
expectation
in
this
quarter
be
disappoint
,
he
,
by
the
interposition
of
his
friend
,
present
a
plan
to
the
french
company
,
in
which
he
set
forth
the
advantage
that
would
accrue
to
themselves
,
from
fix
the
price
,
secure
that
sort
of
tobacco
which
best
suit
the
taste
of
the
public
and
their
manufacture
;
and
finally
,
propose
to
furnish
them
with
any
quantity

at
the
price
which
they
pay
in
the
port
of
London

<EOS>
after
some
dispute
,
they
agree
to
his
proposal

and
contract
with
him
for
fifteen
thousand
hogshead
a

for
which
they
oblige
themselves
to
pay
ready
money

on
its

convenient
port
in

upon

obtain
this

he

set
out

in

put
it
in
execution
;
and
,
by
way
of
companion
,
carry
with
him
a
little
french
abbe

a
man
of
humour

wit

with

many
good

<EOS>
on

which
opportunely
happen

the

for
the
yearly
quantity
of
fifteen
thousand
hogshead
of
such
tobacco
as
be
fit
for
the
french
market

at
a
price
which
he
demonstrate

this
remonstrance
meet
with
all
the

the

see
their

readily
assented
to
the
proposal

which
,
by
their
influence

relish

the
only
difficulty
that
remain

relate
to
the
security
for
payment
of
the
bill
on
the
arrival
of
the
tobacco

to

<EOS>
in

remove
these
objection

Mr

return
to
Europe

find
the
french
company
of
farmer
dispose
to
agree
to
every
thing
he
desire
for
facilitate
the
execution
of
the
contract
,
and
perfectly
well
pleased
with
the
sample
which

but
his
good

(
whom
he
have
leave
behind
him
in
America

by
an
unparalleled
piece
of
treachery

find
mean
to
overturn
the
whole

He
secretly
write
a
memorial
to
the

that
he
find
by
experience

M

could
afford
to
furnish
them
at
a
much
low
price
than
that
which
they

give
;
and
that
,
by
be
in
possession
of
the
contract
for
five
year
,
as
be
intend
accord
to
the
proposal

he
would
have
the
company
so
much
in
his
power
,
that
they
must
afterwards
submit
to
any
price
he
should
please
to
impose
;
and
that
if
they
think
him
worthy
of
such
a
trust
,
he
would
undertake
to
furnish
them
at
an
easy
rate

in

with
some

he

he
have
already
concert

<EOS>
the

be
so
much
alarm
at
these
insinuation

that
they
decline
comply
with
Mr

demand
until

though
they
afterwards
use
all
their
endeavour
to
persuade
him
to
be
concern
with
that
little
traitor
in
his
undertaking
,
(
by
which
he
may
still
have
be
a
very
considerable
gainer
)
<EOS>
he
resist
all
their
solicitation
,
and
plainly
tell
them
in
the
abbe
's
presence
,
that
he
would
never
prostitute
his
own
principle
so
far
,
as
to
enter
into
engagement
of
any
kind
with
a
person
of
his
character
,
much
less
in
a
scheme
that
have
a
manifest
tendency
to
lower
the
market
-
price
of
tobacco
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
thus
end
a
project
the
most
extensive
,
simple
and
easy
,
and
(
as
appear
by
the
trial
make
)
the
best
calculate
to
raise
an
immense
fortune
,
of
any
that
be
ever
undertake

<EOS>
a
project

in
the
execution
of
which

M

have
the
good
of
the
public

and
the
glory
of
put
in
a
flourishing
condition
that
valuable
branch
of
our
trade
,
(
which
give
employment
to
two
great
province
,
and
above
two
hundred
sail
of
ship
)
much
more
at
heart
than
his
own
private
interest

<EOS>
It
be
reasonable
to
expect
,
that
a
man
,
whose
debt
M

have
pay
more
than
once
,
whom
he
have
oblige
in
many
other

carry
with
him
,
at
a
very
considerable
expence
,
on
this
expedition
,
merely
with
a
view
of
better
his
fortune
,
would
have
act
with
common
honesty
,
if
not
with
gratitude
:
but
such
be
the
depravity
of
this
little
monster
's
heart
,
that
on
his
death

bed
he
leave
a
considerable
fortune
to
mere
stranger

with

he
have
little
or
no

without
the
least
thought
of
refund
the
money
advance
for
him
by

in

to
prevent
his
rotting
in
jail

<EOS>
when
M

have
once
obtain
a
command
of
money
,
he
,
by
his
knowledge
in
several
branch
of
trade
,
as
well
as
by
the
assistance
of
some
intelligent
friend
at
Paris
and
London
,
find
mean
to
employ
it
to
very
good
purpose
;
and
have
he
be
a
man
of
that
selfish
disposition
,
which
too
much
prevail
in
the
world
,
he
may
have
be
,
at
this
day
,
master
of
a
very
ample
fortune
:
but
his
ear
be
never
deaf
to
the
voice
of
distress
,
nor
his
beneficent
heart
shut
against
the
calamity
of
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
He
be
even
ingenious
in
contrive
the
most
delicate
method
of
relieve
modest
indigence
,
and
,
by
his
industrious
benevolence
,
often
anticipate
the
request
of
misery
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
relate
a
number
of
example
to
illustrate
my
assertion
,
in
some
of
which
you
would
perceive
the
most
disinterested
generosity
;
but
such
a
detail
would
trespass
too
much
upon
your
time
,
and
I
do
not
pretend
to
dwell
upon
every
minute
circumstance
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
,
upon
the
declaration
of
war
with
Spain
,
he
give
up
all
his
commercial
scheme
,
and
call
in
his
money
from
all
quarter
,
with
a
view
of
sit
down
,
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
content
with
what
he
have
get
,
and
restrain
his
liberality
to
what
he
could
spare
from
his
yearly
income
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
prudential
resolution
,
could
he
have
keep
it
:
but
,
upon
the
breaking
out
of
that
war
,
he
could
not
,
without
concern
,
see
many
gentleman
of
merit
,
who
have
be
recommend
to
him
,
disappoint
of
commission
,
merely
for
want
of
money
to
satisfy
the
expectation
of
the
commission
-
broker
of
that
time
;
and
therefore
launch
out
considerable
sum
for
them
on
their
bare
note
,
great
part
whereof
be
lose
by
the
death
of
some
in
the
unfortunate
expedition
to
the
West

Indies

He

at

after
many
other
action
of
the
like
nature

from
motive
of
pure
humanity
,
love
of
justice

of
oppression

embark
in
a
cause
,
every
way
the
most
important
that
ever
come
under
the
discussion
of
the
court
of
law
in

kingdom
;
whether
it
be
consider
in
relation
to
the
extraordinary
nature

the
immense
property
of
no
less
than
fifty
thousand
pound
a

and
three
peerage

that
depend
upon
it

in
the
year
1740

the
brave
admiral

at

among
the
other

<EOS>
these
pretension
be
no
sooner
communicate
in
the

than
they
become
the
subject
of
conversation
in
all
company

the

indeed

the
early
intelligence

make
himself
know

furnish
him

numberless
advantage

a
plentiful
fortune

and
lord
of
many
manor
in
the

the
claimant

he
know
all
the
witness
who
could
give
the
most
material
evidence
of
his
legitimacy
;
and

if
his
probity
do
not
restrain
him

have

by
his
power

influence

sufficient
opportunity

apply
to
the
passion

interest
of
the
witness

to
silence
many

and
gain
over

his
side

while
his

by
an
absence
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
year
from
his
native
country
,
the
want
of
education

together
with
his
present
helpless
situation

be
render
absolutely
incapable

take
any
step

and
although
his
worthy
uncle

conspicuous
virtue

and
religious
regard
for
justice
and
truth
,
may
possibly
be
an
unconquerable
restraint
to
his

any
undue
advantage

yet
the
conscience
of
that
huge
army
of
emissary
he

very
tender

scrupulous

this
much

however

may
be
say

without
derogation
from

or
impeachment
of
the

while

the

in

his

often
change

the

so
that

perfectly
well

seize
all
opportunity

rare

who
be
by

reduce

extreme
poverty

that
he
actually
marry
a

he
have
long

this

no

understand
that

she
openly
avow
her
marriage
,

go
about
publickly
with
lord

visit
his
acquaintance
in
character

his

<EOS>
from
this
aera
may
be
date
the
beginning
of
Mr
A####y
's
misfortune
:
this
artful
woman
,
who
have
formerly
treat
the
child
with
an
appearance
of
fondness
,
in
order
to
ingratiate
herself
with
the
father
,
now
look
upon
herself
as
sufficiently
establish
in
the
family
,
think
it
be
high
time
to
alter
her
behaviour
with
regard
to
the
unfortunate
boy
;
and
accordingly
,
for
obvious
reason
,
employ
a
thousand
artifice
to
alienate
the
heart
of
this
weak
father
from
his
unhappy
offspring
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
all
her
insinuation
<EOS>
,
nature
still
maintain
her
influence
in
his
heart
;
and
though
she
often
find
mean
to
irritate
him
by
artful
and
malicious
accusation
,
his
resentment
never
extend
farther
than
fatherly
correction
;
and
she
would
have
find
it
impossible
to
accomplish
his
ruin
,
have
not
her
effort
be
reinforce
by
a
new
auxiliary
,
who
be
no
other
than
his
uncle
,
the
present
usurper
of
his
title
and
estate
;
yet
even
this
confederacy
be
over
-
awed
,
in
some
measure
,
by
the
fear
of
alarm
the
unfortunate
mother
,
till
her
distemper
increase
to
a
most
deplorable
degree
of
the
dead
palsy
,
and
the
death
of
her
father
have
reduce
her
to
a
most
forlorn
and
abject
state
of
distress
.
<EOS>
then
they
venture
upon
the
execution
of
their
project
;
and
(
though
their
aim
be
widely
different
)
concur
in
their
endeavour
to
remove
the
hapless
boy
,
as
the
common
obstacle
to
both
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
Al####m
,
who
(
as
I
have
already
observe
)
be
a
man
of
weak
intellect
,
and
utterly
void
of
any
fix
principle
of
action
,
be
,
by
this
time
,
reduce
to
such
a
pitch
of
misery
,
that
he
be
often
oblige
to
pawn
his
wear
-
apparel
,
in
order
to
procure
the
common
necessary
of
life
;
and
have
no
other
fund
remain
,
with
which
he
could
relieve
his
present
necessity
,
except
his
sale
of
the
reversion
of
the
A####a
estate
,
to
which
the
nonage
of
his
son
be
an
effectual
bar
,
he
be
advise
by
his
virtuous
brother
,
and
the
rest
of
his
counsellor
,
to
surmount
this
difficulty
,
by
secrete
his
son
,
and
spread
a
report
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
this
honest
project
he
the
more
readily
embrace
,
because
he
know
that
no
act
of
his
could
frustrate
the
child
's
succession
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
boy
be
remove
from
the
school
at
which
he
be
then
board
,
to
the
house
of
one
K####gh

an
agent
and
accomplice
of
the
present
earl
of

,
where
he
be
keep
for
several
month
closely
confine
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
it
be
industriously
report
that
he
be
dead
.
    
<EOS>
this
previous
measure
be
take
,
lord

publish
advertisement
in
the
gazette
,
offer
reversion
of
the
A####a

various
kind
be

to

such
as
be
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
settlement
of
these
estate

or
stranger
to
the
affair
of
his

<EOS>
some
people
,
impose
upon
by
the
report
of
the
child
's
death
,
be
draw
in
to
purchase
,
think
themselves
safe
in
the
concurrence
of
his

upon
presumption
that
he

in
remainder
to

other

by
the
smallness
of
the
price

(
which
rarely
exceed
half
a

's
purchase

as
appear
by
many
deed
)
though
they
doubt
the
truth
of
the
boy

be
dead

run
small
risque
on
the
contingency
of
his
dying
before
he
should
be
of
age

or
in
hope

their
transaction

suddenly
interrupt

and
the
scheme
of
raise
more
money

for
the
present

defeat
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
boy

who
be
naturally
sprightly
and
impatient
of
restraint
,
have
find
mean
to
break
from
his
confinement
,
and
wander
up
and
down
the
street
of
Dublin
,
avoid
his
father
's
house
,
and
choose
to
encounter
all
sort
of
distress
,
rather
than
subject
himself
again
to
the
cruelty
and
malice
of
the
woman
who
supply
his
mother
's
place
.
    
<EOS>
thus
debar
his
father
's
protection
,
and
destitute
of
any
fixed
habitation

he
herd
with
all
the
loose

idle

disorderly
youth
in
Dublin

skulk
chiefly
about
the
college

several

of

take
pity
on
his
misfortune

supply
him
at
different

with
cloath

money

<EOS>
in
this
unsettled
and
uncomfortable
way
of
life
do
he
remain
,
from
the
year
1725
to
the
latter
end
of
November
1727
;
at
which
time
his
father
die
so
miserably
poor
,
that
he
be
actually
bury
at
the
public
expence
.
    
<EOS>
this
unfortunate
nobleman
be
no
sooner
dead

than
his
brother
Richard

<EOS>
now
earl
of

take
advantage
of
the
non

age

helpless
situation
of
his

seize
upon
all
the
paper
of
the
defunct

afterwards
usurp
the
title
of

,
to
the
surprize
of
the
servant
,
and
<EOS>
other
who
be

the
affair
of
the

<EOS>
this
usurpation
,
bold
as
it
be
,
produce
no
other
effect
than
that
of
his
be
insult
by
the
populace
as
he
go
through

the
refusal

the

tho

not

repine

conscious
that
it
would
gradually
vanish
with
the
novelty
of
his

as

the
last

he
conquer
it
by
mean
well
known
and
obvious
.
    
<EOS>
nor
will
it
seem
strange
,
that
he
should
thus
invade
the
right
of
an
orphan
with
impunity
,
if
people
will
consider
,
that
the
late
lord

have
not
only
squander
away
his
fortune
,
with
the
most
ridiculous
extravagance
,
but
also
associate
himself
with
low
company

so
that
he
be
little
know

and
less
regarded

by
person
of
any
rank

figure
in
life

his

debar
of
the
advantage
which
may

accrue
from
valuable

<EOS>
and
tho

<EOS>
it

that

such
be
the
obscurity
in
which
the

live

during

that

Over

not
without
reason

suspect
to
be
concern
in

<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
his
connection
with
the
usurper
be
now
break
off
by
a
quarrel
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
have
throw
up
his
agency

and
he
invite
the
hapless
stranger
to
his
house

with
a
view
of
make
all
possible
advantage
of
such
a
guest

<EOS>
there
he

not

one
of
his

in
his
house
at
the

time

but
afterwards
,
see
no
person
of
consequence
willing
to
espouse
his
cause
,
he
look
upon
him
as
an
incumbrance
,

want
to
rid
his

of
him
accordingly

<EOS>
He
remember
that
Mr

express
himself
with
all
the

of
apprehension

in
favour
of
the
unfortunate
young

the
generosity
of
his

<EOS>
Mr

where
he
be
sure

and
where
every

(
as
he

)
would
make
the
cause

all
the

the
whole

of
such
an

all
the

lay
the
case

<EOS>
could
possibly
be

at
so
great

<EOS>
the

his

all
the
interruption
in
their
power
to

honest

<EOS>
the
usurper
himself

at

His

to
whom
Mr
m####r
have
recourse
,
and
still
meet
with
the
same
unvaried
information
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
,
he
make
such
progress
in
his
inquiry
,
that
in
less
than
two
month
no
few
than
one
hundred
person
,
from
different
quarter
of
the
kingdom
,
either
personally
,
or
by
letter
,
communicate
their
knowledge
of
the
claimant
,
in
declaration
consonant
with
one
another
,
as
well
as
with
the
account
he
give
of
himself
.
<EOS>
several
servant
who
have
live
with
his
father
,
and
be
deceive
with
the
story
of
his
death
,
so
industriously
propagate
by
his
uncle
,
no
sooner
hear
of
his
being
in
Dublin
,
than
they
come
from
different
part
of
the
country
to
see
him
;
and
though
great
pain
be
take
to
deceive
them
,
they
,
nevertheless
,
know
him
at
first
sight
;
some
of
them
fall
upon
their
knee
,
to
thank
heaven
for
his
preservation
,
embrace
his
leg
,
and
shed
tear
of
joy
for
his
return
.
    
<EOS>
although
the
conduct
of
his
adversary
,
particularly
in
the
above
-
mention
prosecution
,
together
with
the
evidence
that
already
appear
,
be
sufficient
to
convince
all
mankind
of
the
truth
of
the
claimant
's
pretension
,
Mr
m####r
,
in
order
to
be
further
satisfied
,
resolve
to
see
how
he
would
be
receive
upon
the
spot
where
he
be
bear
;
justly
conclude
,
that
if
he
be
really
an
impostor
,
the
bastard
of
a
kitchen
-
wench
,
produce
in
a
country
intirely
possess
by
his
enemy
and
his
ally
,
he
must
be
look
upon
in
that
place
with
the
utmost
detestation
and
contempt
.
    
<EOS>
this
his
intention
be
no
sooner
know
to
the
adverse
party
,
than
their
agent
and
friend
,
from
all
quarter
,
<EOS>
repair
to
that
place
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
and
use
all
their
influence
with
the
people
,
in
remonstrance
,
threat
,
and
all
the
other
art
they
could
devise
,
not
only
to
discountenance
the
claimant
upon
his
arrival
,
but
even
to
spirit
up
a
mob
to
insult
him
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
precaution
,
and
the
servile
awe
and
subjection
in
which
tenant
be
keep
by
their
landlord
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
as
soon
as
it
be
know
that
Mr
A####y
approach
the
town
,
the
inhabitant
crowd
out
in
great
multitude
to
receive
and
welcome
him
,
and
accompany
him
into
town
with
acclamation
and
other
expression
of
joy
,
insomuch
that
the
agent
of
his
adversary
durst
not
shew
their
face
.
<EOS>
the
sovereign
of
the
corporation
,
who
be
a
particular
creature
and
favourite
of
the
usurper
,
and
whose
all
depend
upon
the
issue
of
the
cause
,
be
so
conscious
of
the
stranger
's
right
,
and
so
much
awe
by
the
behaviour
of
the
people
,
who
know
that
consciousness
,
that
he
do
not
think
it
safe
,
even
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
neutrality
upon
this
occasion
,
but
actually
hold
the
stirrup
while
Mr
A####y
dismount
from
his
horse
.
    
<EOS>
this
sense
of
conviction
in
the
people
,
manifest
itself
still
more
powerfully
,
when
he
return
to
the
same
place
in
the
year
1744
,
about
which
time
lord
A####a
be
inform
of
his
resolution
,
determine
again
to
be
before
-
hand
with
him
,
and
set
out
in
person
with
his
agent
and
friend
,
some
of
whom
be
detach
before
him
,
to
prepare
for
his
reception
,
and
induce
the
people
to
meet
him
in
a
body
,
and
accompany
him
to
town
,
with
such
expression
of
welcome
as
they
have
before
bestow
on
his
nephew
:
but
in
spite
of
all
their
art
and
interest
,
he
be
suffer
to
pass
through
the
street
in
a
mournful
silence
;
and
though
several
barrel
of
beer
be
produce
,
to
court
the
favour
of
the
populace
,
they
have
no
other
effect
than
that
of
draw
their
ridicule
upon
the
donor
;
whereas
,
when
Mr
A####y
,
two
day
afterwards
,
appear
,
all
the
inhabitant
,
with
garland
,
streamer
,
music
,
and
other
ensign
of
joy
,
crowd
out
to
meet
him
,
and
usher
him
into
town
with
such
demonstration
of
pleasure
and
good
-
will
,
that
the
noble
peer
find
it
convenient
to
hide
himself
from
the
resentment
of
his
own
tenant
,
the
effect
of
which
he
must
have
severely
feel
,
have
not
he
be
screen
by
the
timely
remonstrance
of
Mr
m####r
,
and
the
other
gentleman
who
accompany
his
competitor
.
    
<EOS>
nor
do
his
apprehension
vanish
with
the
transaction
of
this
day
;
the
town
be
again
in
uproar
on
the
Sunday
follow
,
when
it
be
know
that
Mr
A####y
intend
to
come
thither
,
from
Dunmain
,
to
church
:
they
go
out
to
meet
him
as
before
,
and
conduct
him
to
the
church
-
door
with
acclamation
,
which
terrify
his
uncle
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
flee
with
precipitation
in
a
boat
,
and
soon
after
intirely
quit
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
an
endless
task
to
enumerate
the
particular
step
that
be
take
by
one
side
to
promote
,
and
by
the
other
to
delay
the
trial
:
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
's
adversary
find
that
they
could
not
,
by
all
the
subterfuge
and
art
they
have
use
,
evade
it
,
repeat
attempt
be
make
to
assassinate
him
and
his
protector
,
and
every
obstruction
throw
in
the
way
of
his
cause
which
craft
could
invent
,
villany
execute
,
and
undue
influence
confirm
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
difficulty
be
surmount
by
the
vigilance
,
constancy
,
courage
and
sagacity
of
m####r
;
and
,
at
last
,
the
affair
be
bring
to
a
very
solemn
trial
at
bar
,
which
be
continue
,
by
several
adjournment
,
from
the
eleventh
to
the
twenty
-
fifth
day
of
November
,
a
verdict
be
find
for
the
claimant
,
by
a
jury
of
gentleman
,
which
,
in
point
of
reputation
and
property
,
can
not
be
easily
paralelle
in
the
annal
of
that
or
any
other
country
;
a
jury
that
could
by
no
means
be
suspect
of
prepossession
in
favour
of
Mr
An####y
,
(
to
whose
person
they
be
absolute
stranger
)
especially
if
we
consider
that
a
gentleman
in
their
neighbourhood
,
who
be
nephew
to
the
foreman
,
and
nearly
relate
to
some
of
the
rest
of
their
number
,
forfeit
a
considerable
estate
by
their
decision
.
    
<EOS>
this
verdict
(
say
the
parson
)
give
the
high
satisfaction
to
all
impartial
person
that
be
within
reach
of
be
truly
inform
of
their
proceeding
,
and
of
the
different
genius
and
conduct
of
the
party
engage
in
the
contest
;
but
more
especially
to
such
as
be
in
court
(
as
I
be
)
at
the
trial
,
and
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
the
character
and
behaviour
of
the
person
who
appear
there
to
give
evidence
.
      
<EOS>
to
such
it
be
very
apparent
,
that
all
the
witness
produce
there
on
the
part
of
the
uncle
,
be
either
his
tenant
,
dependent
,
pot
-
companion
,
or
person
<EOS>
some
way
or
other
interested
in
the
issue
of
the
suit
,
and
remarkable
for
a
low
kind
of
cunning
:
that
many
of
them
be
person
of
profligate
life
,
who
deserve
no
credit
:
that
(
independent
of
the
levity
of
their
character
)
those
of
them
who
go
under
the
denomination
of
colonel
,
(
colonel
L####fts
alone
except
,
who
have
nothing
to
say
,
and
be
only
bring
there
in
order
to
give
credit
to
that
party
)
make
so
ridiculous
a
figure
,
and
give
so
absurd
,
contradictory
and
inconsistent
an
evidence
,
as
no
court
or
jury
could
give
the
least
degree
of
credit
to
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
observe
,
that
the
nephew
and
Mr
m####r
<EOS>
his
chief
manager
,
(
be
absolute
stranger
in
that
country
,
and
unacquainted
with
the
character
of
the
person
they
have
to
deal
with
)
be
oblige
to
lay
before
the
court
and
jury
such
evidence
as
come
to
their
hand
,
some
of
whom
plainly
appear
to
have
be
put
upon
them
by
their
adversary
,
with
a
design
to
hurt
 
<EOS>
It
be
also
manifest
,
that
the
witness
produce
for
Mr
A####y
be
such
as
could
have
no
manner
of
connexion
with
him
,
nor
any
dependence
whatsoever
upon
him
,
to
influence
their
evidence
;
for
the
far
great
part
of
them
have
never
see
him
from
his
infancy
,
till
the
trial
begin
;
and
that
many
of
them
(
though
poor
and
undignified
with
the
title
of
colonel
)
be
people
of
unblemished
character
,
of
great
simplicity
,
and
such
as
no
man
in
his
sense
would
pitch
upon
to
support
a
bad
cause
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
the
jury
,
(
whose
well
-
know
honour
,
impartiality
and
penetration
must
be
revere
by
all
who
be
acquaint
with
them
)
be
not
under
the
least
difficulty
about
their
verdict
;
for
they
be
not
inclose
above
half
an
hour
,
when
they
return
with
it
.
       
<EOS>
these
gentleman
could
not
help
observe
the
great
inequality
of
the
party
engage
,
the
great
advantage
that
the
uncle
have
in
every
other
respect
(
except
the
truth
and
justice
of
his
case
)
over
the
nephew
,
by
mean
of
his
vast
possession
,
and
of
his
power
and
influence
all
round
the
place
of
his
birth
;
nor
could
the
contrast
between
the
different
genius
's
of
the
two
party
escape
their
observation
.
  
<EOS>
They
could
not
but
see
and
conclude
,
that
a
person
who
have
confessedly
transport
and
sell
his
orphan
-
nephew
into
slavery
,
who
,
on
his
return
,
have
carry
on
so
unwarrantable
and
cruel
a
prosecution
to
take
away
his
life
,
under
colour
of
law
,
and
who
have
also
give
such
glaring
proof
of
his
skill
and
dexterity
in
the
management
of
witness
for
that
cruel
purpose
,
be
in
like
manner
capable
of
exert
the
same
happy
talent
on
this
occasion
,
when
his
all
be
at
stake
;
<EOS>
more
especially
,
as
he
have
so
many
other
who
be
equally
interested
with
himself
,
and
whose
ability
,
in
that
respect
,
fall
nothing
short
of
his
own
,
to
second
him
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
the
jury
have
also
a
near
view
of
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
deliver
their
testimony
,
and
have
from
thence
an
opportunity
of
observe
many
circumstance
and
distinguish
characteristic
of
truth
and
falshood
,
from
which
a
great
deal
could
be
gather
,
that
could
not
be
adequately
convey
by
any
print
account
,
how
exact
soever
;
consequently
,
they
must
have
be
much
well
judge
of
the
evidence
on
which
they
found
their
verdict
,
than
any
person
,
who
have
not
the
same
opportunity
,
can
possibly
be
.
    
<EOS>
these
,
Mr
Pickle
,
be
my
reflection
on
what
I
have
occasion
to
observe
concern
that
famous
trial
;
and
on
my
return
to
England
two
year
after
,
I
could
not
help
pity
the
self
-
sufficiency
of
some
people
,
who
,
at
this
distance
,
pretend
to
pass
their
judgment
on
that
verdict
with
as
great
positiveness
,
as
if
they
have
be
in
the
secret
of
the
cause
,
or
upon
the
jury
who
try
it
;
and
that
from
no
well
authority
;
than
the
declamation
of
lord
An####a
's
emissary
,
and
some
falsify
print
account
,
artfully
cook
up
,
on
purpose
to
mislead
and
deceive
.
    
<EOS>
but
to
return
from
this
digression
,
lord
A####a
,
the
defendant
in
that
cause
,
be
so
conscious
of
the
strength
and
merit
of
his
injure
nephew
's
case
,
and
that
a
verdict
would
go
against
him
,
that
he
order
a
writ
of
error
to
be
make
out
before
the
trial
be
end
;
and
the
verdict
be
no
sooner
give
,
than
he
immediately
lodge
it
,
though
he
well
know
he
have
no
manner
of
error
to
assign
.
<EOS>
this
expedient
be
practise
merely
for
vexation
and
delay
,
in
order
to
keep
Mr
A####y
from
the
possession
of
the
small
estate
he
have
recover
by
the
verdict
;
that
,
his
slender
fund
be
exhaust
,
he
may
be
deprive
of
other
mean
to
prosecute
his
right
;
and
,
by
the
most
oppressive
contrivance
and
scandalous
chicanery
,
it
have
be
keep
up
to
this
day
,
without
his
be
able
to
assign
the
least
shadow
of
any
error
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
a####a
be
not
the
only
antagonist
that
Mr
A####y
have
to
deal
with
;
all
the
different
branch
of
the
A####a
family
,
who
have
be
worry
one
another
at
law
ever
since
the
death
of
the
late
earl
of
a####a
,
about
the
partition
of
his
great
estate
,
be
now
firmly
united
in
an
association
against
this
unfortunate
gentleman
;
mutual
deed
be
execute
among
them
,
by
which
many
great
lordship
and
estate
be
give
up
by
the
uncle
to
person
who
have
no
right
to
possess
them
,
in
order
to
engage
them
to
side
with
him
against
his
nephew
,
in
withhold
the
unjust
possession
of
the
remainder
.
    
<EOS>
these
confederate
have
hold
several
consultation
against
their
common
enemy
,
and
find
that
his
cause
gather
daily
strength
since
the
trial
,
by
the
accession
of
many
witness
of
figure
and
reputation
,
who
have
not
be
hear
of
before
;
and
that
the
only
chance
they
have
to
prevent
the
speedy
establishment
of
his
right
,
and
their
own
destruction
,
be
by
strip
Mr
m####r
of
the
little
money
that
yet
remain
,
and
stop
all
further
resource
whereby
he
may
be
enable
to
proceed
;
they
,
therefore
,
come
to
a
determined
resolution
to
carry
that
hopeful
scheme
into
execution
;
and
,
in
pursuance
thereof
,
they
have
leave
no
expedient
or
stratagem
,
how
extraordinary
or
scandalous
soever
,
unpractise
to
distress
Mr
An####y
and
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
for
that
end
,
all
the
oppressive
art
and
dilatory
expensive
contrivance
that
the
fertile
invention
of
the
low
pettifogger
of
the
law
could
possibly
devise
,
have
with
great
dexterity
be
play
off
against
them
in
fruitless
,
quibbling
,
and
malicious
suit
,
intirely
foreign
to
the
merit
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
not
to
mention
numberless
other
act
of
oppression
,
the
most
extraordinary
and
unprecedented
proceeding
,
by
mean
whereof
this
sham
writ
of
error
hath
be
keep
on
foot
ever
since
November
1743
,
be
to
me
(
say
the
doctor
)
a
most
flagrant
instance
,
not
only
of
the
prevalency
of
power
and
money
,
(
<EOS>
when
employ
,
as
in
the
present
case
,
against
an
unfortunate
,
helpless
man
,
disable
,
as
he
be
,
of
the
mean
of
ascertain
his
right

but
of
the
badness
of
a
cause
,
that
hath
recourse
to
so
many
iniquitous
expedient
to
support
it
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
whole
conduct
of
lord
A####a
and
his
party
,
from
the
beginning
to
this
time
,
hath
be
such
,
as

<EOS>
among
many
other

malicious

with

upon
which
he
open
his

<EOS>

You

I
have

for
you

and
then
you
mought
have
knock
down
this
great
lubberly
hurricane

<EOS>
but
,
mayhap
,
you
turn
in

,
and
so
you
do
not

to
trust
yourself
and
your

"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
bear
his
joke
with
great
good
-
humour
,
rally
him
in
his
turn
about
the
dairy
-
maid
at
the
garrison
,
enquire
about
his
friend
in
the
country
,
ask
if
he
have
be
to
visit
his
niece
,
and
,
finally
,
express
a
desire
of
know
the
cause
of
his
journey
to
London
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
satisfy
his
curiosity
in
all
these
particular
;
and
,
in
answer
to
the
last
question
,
observe
,
that
understanding
,
from
the
information
of
Pipes
,
that
he
be

,
he
have
come
from

in

him
into

<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how

say
he
)
;
but
if
so
be

as
three

bring
you
clear

say
the

and
you

not

bind

for

"
    
<EOS>
this
be
an
offer
which
few
people
,
in
our
hero
's
situation
,
would
have
altogether
refuse
;
especially
as
he
have
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
,
that
,
far
from
be
a
vain
,
unmeaning
compliment
,
it
be
the
genuine
tribute
of
friendship
,
which
the
lieutenant
would
have
willingly
,
ay
and
with
pleasure
,
pay
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Peregrine
peremptorily
refuse
his
assistance
,
tho
'
not
without
express
himself
in
term
of
acknowledgment
suitable
to
the
occasion
;
and
tell
him
,
it
would
be
time
enough
to
make
use
of
his
generosity
,
when
he
should
find
himself
destitute
of
all
other
resource
.
<EOS>
Jack
employ
all
his
rhetorick
,
with
a
view
of
persuade
him
to
take
this
opportunity
to
procure
his
own
enlargement
;
and
,
find
his
argument
ineffectual
,
insist
upon
his
accept
an
immediate
supply
for
his
necessary
occasion
;
swear
,
with
great
vehemence
,
that
he
would
never
return
to
the
garison
,
unless
he
would
put
him
upon
the
footing
of
any
other
tenant
,
and
receive
his
rent
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
as
positively
swear
,
that
he
never
would
consider
him
in
that
light
;
<EOS>
remonstrating
,
that
he
have
long
ago
settle
the
house
upon
him
for
life
,
as
a
pledge
of
his
own
esteem
,
as
well
as
in
conformity
with
the
commodore
's
desire
;
and
beseech
him
to
return
to
his
usual
avocation
,
protest
that
,
if
ever
his
situation
should
subject
him
to
the
necessity
of
borrow
from
his
friend
,
Mr
Hatchway
should
be
the
first
man
to
whom
he
would
apply
himself
for
succour
.
    
<EOS>
to
convince
him
that
this
be
not
the
case
at
present
,
he
produce
the
bank
-
note
,
which
he
have
receive
in
the
letter
,
together
with
his
own
ready
money
;
and
mention
some
other
fund
,
which
he
invent
extempore
,
in
order
to
amuse
the
lieutenant
's
concern
.
<EOS>
in
the
close
of
this
expostulation
,
he
desire
Pipes
to
conduct
Mr
Hatchway
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
may
entertain
himself
with
the
newspaper
for
half
an
hour
;
during
which
he
would
put
on
his
cloath
,
and
bespeak
something
for
dinner
,
that
they
may
enjoy
each
other
's
company
,
as
long
as
his
occasion
would
permit
him
to
stay
in
that
place

<EOS>
the
two
sailor
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
he
take
up
the
pen
,
and
write
the
follow
letter
,
in
which
he
inclose
the
bank
-
note
,
to
his
generous
benefactress
:
    
Madam
,
Your
humanity
be
not
more
ingenious
than
my
suspicion
.
<EOS>
in
vain
you
attempt
to
impose
upon
me
by
an
act
of
generosity
,
which
no
person
upon
earth
,
but
your
ladyship
,
be
capable
of
commit
.
<EOS>
tho
'
your
name
be
not
subscribe
on
the
paper
,
your
sentiment
be
fully
display
in
the
content
,
which
I
must
beg
leave
to
restore
,
with
the
same
sense
of
gratitude
,
and
for
the
same
reason
I
express
,
when
last
I
have
the
honour
to
converse
with
you
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
tho
'
I
be
deprive
of
my
liberty
,
by
the
villainy
and
ingratitude
of
mankind
,
I
be
not
yet
destitute
of
the
other
conveniencie
of
life
;
and
,
therefore
,
beg
to
be
excuse
from
incur
an
unnecessary
addition
to
that
load
of
obligation
you
have
already
lay
upon
,
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
Your
ladyship
's
most
devoted
,
humble
servant
,
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
have
dress
himself
,
and
repair
to
the
place
of
appointment
,
he
dispatch
this
epistle
by
the
hand
of
Pipes
,
who
be
order
to
leave
it
at
her
ladyship
's
house
,
without
stay
for
an
answer
;
and
in
the
mean
time
give
direction
for
dinner
,
which
he
and
his
friend
Hatchway
eat
very
chearfully
in
his
own
apartment
,
after
he
have
entertain
him
with
a
sight
of
all
the
curiosity
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
during
their
repast
,
Jack
repeat
his
kind
offer
to
our
adventurer
,
who
decline
them
with
his
former
obstinacy
,
and
beg
he
may
be
no
more
importune
on
that
subject
:
but
,
if
he
insist
upon
give
some
fresh
proof
of
his
friendship
,
he
may
have
an
opportunity
of
exhibit
it
in
take
pipe
under
his
care
and
protection
;
for
nothing
affect
him
so
much
as
his
inability
to
provide
for
such
a
faithful
adherent
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
desire
he
would
give
himself
no
trouble
upon
that
score
;
he
be
,
of
his
own
accord
,
perfectly
well
disposed
to
befriend
his
old
ship
-
mate
,
who
should
never
want
,
while
he
have
a
shilling
to
spare
.
<EOS>
but
he
begin
to
drop
some
hint
of
an
intention
to
fix
his
quarter
in
the
Fleet
,
observe
,
that
the
air
seem
to
be
very
good
in
that
place
,
and
that
he
be
tired
of
live
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
what
he
say
do
not
amount
to
a
plain
declaration
,
and
therefore
Peregrine
do
not
answer
it
as
such
,
tho
'
he
perceive
his
drift
;
and
take
an
opportunity
of
describe
the
inconvenience
of
the
place
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
he
hope
would
deter
him
from
put
such
an
extravagant
plan
in
execution
.
    
<EOS>
this
expedient
,
however
,
far
from
answer
the
end
propose
,
have
a
quite
contrary
effect
,
and
furnish
Hatchway
with
an
argument
against
his
own
unwillingness
to
quit
such
a
disagreeable
place
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
all
probability
,
Jack
would
have
be
more
explicit
,
with
regard
to
the
scheme
he
have
propose
,
if
the
conversation
have
not
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
Cadwallader
,
who
never
fail
in
the
performance
of
his
diurnal
visit
.
<EOS>
hatchway
,
conjecture
that
this
stranger
may
have
some
private
business
with
his
friend
,
quit
the
apartment
,
on
pretence
of
take
a
turn
:
and
meet
Pipes
at
the
door
,
desire
his
company
to
the
Bear
,
by
which
name
the
open
space
be
distinguish
;
where
,
during
a
course
of
perambulation
,
these
two
companion
hold
a
council
upon
Pickle
:
in
consequence
of
which
it
be
determine
,
since
he
obstinately
persist
to
refuse
their
assistance
,
that
they
should
take
lodging
in
his
neighbourhood
,
with
a
view
of
be
at
hand
to
minister
unto
his
occasion
,
in
spite
of
his
false
delicacy
,
accord
to
the
emergency
of
his
affair
.
    
<EOS>
this
resolution
be
take
,
they
consult
the
bar
-
keeper
of
the
coffee
-
house
about
lodging
,
and
she
direct
them
to
the
warden
;
to
whom
the
lieutenant
,
in
his
great
wisdom
,
represent
himself
as
a
kinsman
to
Peregrine
,
who
,
rather
than
leave
that
young
gentleman
by
himself
to
the
unavoidable
discomfort
of
a
prison
,
be
incline
to
keep
him
company
,
'
till
such
time
as
his
affair
could
be
put
in
order
.
    
<EOS>
this
measure
he
the
more
anxiously
desire
to
take
,
because
the
prisoner
be
sometimes
subject
to
a
disorder
imagination
,
upon
which
occasion
he
stand
in
need
of
extraordinary
attendance
;
and
therefore
he
(
the
lieutenant
)
intreate
the
warden
to
accommodate
him
with
a
lodging
for
himself
and
his
servant
,
for
which
he
be
ready
to
make
any
reasonable
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
the
warden
,
who
be
a
sensible
and
humane
man
,
could
not
help
applaud
his
resolution
;
and
several
room
be
at
that
time
unoccupied
,
he
put
him
immediately
in
possession
of
a
couple
,
which
be
forthwith
prepare
for
his
reception
.
    
<EOS>
this
affair
be
settle
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
dispatch
Pipes
for
his
portmanteau
;
and
return
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
sound
Peregrine
,
with
whom
he
spend
the
remain
part
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
take
it
for
grant
that
he
propose
to
set
out
for
the
garison
next
day
,
write
a
memorandum
of
some
book
which
he
have
leave
in
that
habitation
,
and
which
he
now
desire
Jack
to
send
up
to
town
by
the
waggon
,
direct
for
Mr
Crabtree
;
and
caution
him
against
give
the
least
hint
of
his
misfortune
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
it
may
remain
,
as
long
as
possible
,
conceal
from
the
knowledge
of
his
sister
,
(
who
,
he
know
,
would
afflict
herself
immoderately
at
the
news
)
nor
reach
the
ear
of
the
rest
of
his
family
,
who
would
exult
and
triumph
over
his
distress
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
listen
to
his
injunction
with
great
attention
,
and
promise
to
demean
himself
accordingly
:
then
the
discourse
shift
to
an
agreeable
recapitulation
of
the
merry
scene
they
have
formerly
act
together
;
and
the
evening
be
pretty
far
advanced
,
Peregrine
,
with
seem
reluctance
,
tell
him
that
the
gate
of
the
Fleet
would
in
a
few
minute
be
shut
for
the
night
,
and
that
there
be
an
absolute
necessity
for
his
withdrawing
to
his
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
Jack
reply
,
that
he
could
not
think
of
part
with
him
so
soon
,
after
such
a
long
separation
;
and
that
he
be
determined
to
stay
with
him
an
hour
or
two
long
,
if
he
should
be
oblige
to
take
up
his
lodging
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
rather
than
disoblige
his
guest
,
indulge
him
in
his
desire
,
and
resolve
to
give
him
a
share
of
his
own
bed
.
<EOS>
a
pair
of
chicken
and
'
sparagus
be
bespeak
for
supper
,
at
which
Pipes
attend
with
an
air
of
internal
satisfaction
;
and
the
bottle
be
bandy
about
in
a
jovial
manner
'
till
midnight
,
when
the
lieutenant
rise
up
to
take
his
leave
,
observe
,
that
be
fatigue
with
ride
,
he
be
incline
to
turn
-
in
.
<EOS>
pipe
,
upon
this
intimation
,
produce
a
lanthorn
ready
light
;
and
<EOS>
Jack
,
shake
his
entertainer
by
the
hand
,
wish
him
good
-
night
,
and
promise
to
visit
him
again
betime
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
imagine
that
this
behaviour
proceed
from
the
wine
,
which
he
have
plentifully
drink
,
tell
him
,
that
if
he
be
dispose
to
sleep
,
his
bed
be
ready
prepare
in
the
room
,
and
order
his
attendant
to
undress
his
master
;
upon
which
Mr
Hatchway
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
no
occasion
to
incommode
his
friend
,
have
already
provide
a
lodging
for
himself
:
and
the
young
gentleman
demand
an
explanation
,
he
frankly
own
what
he
have
do
,
say
,
"
You
give
me
such
a
dismal
account
of
the
place
,
that
I
could
not
think
of
leave
you
in
it
without
company
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
who
be
naturally
impatient
of
benefit
,
and
foresaw
that
this
uncommon
instance
of
Hatchway
's
friendship
would
encroach
upon
the
plan
which
he
have
form
for
his
own
subsistence
,
by
engross
his
time
and
attention
,
so
as
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
prosecute
his
labour
;
closet
the
lieutenant
next
day
,
and
demonstrate
to
him
the
folly
and
ill
consequence
of
the
step
he
have
take
.
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
the
world
in
general
would
look
upon
it
as
the
effect
of
mere
madness
;
and
,
if
his
relation
be
so
disposed
,
they
may
make
it
the
foundation
of
a
statute
of
lunacy
against
him
;
that
his
absence
from
the
garison
must
be
a
very
great
detriment
to
his
private
affair
;
and
,
lastly
,
that
his
presence
in
the
Fleet
would
be
a
very
great
hindrance
to
Pickle
himself
,
whose
hope
of
regain
his
liberty
altogether
depend
upon
his
be
detach
from
all
company
and
interruption
.
    
<EOS>
to
these
remonstrance
Jack
reply
,
that
,
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
,
it
be
no
more
to
him
than
a
rotten
net
-
line
;
and
if
his
relation
have
a
mind
to
have
his
upper
work
condemn
,
he
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
should
be
able
to
stand
the
survey
,
without
be
declare
unfit
for
service
;
that
he
have
no
affair
at
the
garison
,
but
such
as
would
keep
cold
;
and
with
regard
to
Pickle
's
be
interrupt
by
his
presence
,
he
give
him
his
word
,
that
he
would
never
come
along
-
side
of
him
,
except
when
he
should
give
him
the
signal
for
hold
discourse
.
<EOS>
in
conclusion
,
he
signify
his
resolution
to
stay
where
he
be
,
at
all
event
,
without
make
himself
accountable
to
any
person
whatsoever
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
see
him
determine
,
desist
from
any
further
importunity
;
resolving
,
however
,
to
tire
him
out
of
his
plan
by
reserve
and
supercilious
neglect
;
for
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
be
so

<EOS>
with
this
view
he
quit
the
lieutenant
,
upon
some
slight
pretence
;
after
have
tell
him
,
that
he
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
his
company
at
dinner
,
because
he
be
engage
with
a
particular
club
of
his

prisoner
.
    
<EOS>
Jack
be
a
stranger
to
the
punctilio
of
behaviour
,
and
therefore
do
not
take
this
declaration
amiss
;
but
have
immediate
recourse
to
the
advice
of
his
counsellor
Mr
Pipes
,
who
propose
that
he
should
go
to
the
coffee
-
house
and
kitchen
,
and
give
the
people
to
understand
that
he
would
pay
for
all
such
liquor
and
provision
as
Mr
Pickle
should
order
to
be
send
to
his
own
lodging
.
<EOS>
this
expedient
be
immediately
practise
;
and
,
as
there
be
no
credit
in
the
place
,
Hatchway
deposit
a
sum
of
money
,
by
way
of
security
,
to
the
cook
and
the
vintner
,
intimate
,
that
there
be
a
necessity
for
take
that
method
of
befriend
his
cousin
Peregrine
,
who
be
subject
to
strange
whim
,
that
render
it
impossible
to
serve
him
any
other
way
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
insinuation
,
it
be
that
same
day
rumour
about
the
Fleet
,
that
Mr
Pickle
be
an
unhappy
gentleman
disorder
in
his
understanding
,
and
that
the
lieutenant
be
his
near
relation
,
who
have
subject
himself
to
the
inconvenience
of
live
in
a
jail
,
with
the
sole
view
of
keep
a
strict
eye
over
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
this
report
,
however
,
do
not
reach
the
ear
of
our
hero
till
next
day
,
when
he
send
one
of
the
runner
of
the
Fleet
,
who
attend
him
,
to
bespeak
and
pay
for
a
couple
of
pullet
,
and
something
else
,
for
dinner
,
to
which
he
have
already
invite
his
friend
Hatchway
,
in
hope
of
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
retire
into
the
country
,
after
he
have
undergo
a
whole
day
's
mortification
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
messenger
return
with
an
assurance
,
that
the
dinner
should
be
make
ready
accord
to
his
direction
,
and
restore
the
money
,
observe
that
his
kinsman
have
pay
for
what
be
bespoke
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
equally
surprize
and
disgust
at
this
information
,
and
resolve
to
chide
the
lieutenant
severely
,
for
his
unseasonable
treat
,
which
he
consider
as
a
thing
repugnant
to
his
reputation
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
while

he
dispatch
his
attendant
for
wine
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
find
his
credit
bolster
up
in
that
place
by
the
same
mean
,
be
enrage
at
the
presumption
of
Jack
's
friendship
,
and
question
the
valet
about
it
,
with
such
manifestation
of
displeasure
,
that
the
fellow
,
afraid
of
disoblige
such
a
good
master
,
frankly
communicate
the
story
which
be
circulate
at
his
expence
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
be
so
much
incensed
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
that
he
write
a
bitter
expostulation
to
the
lieutenant
,
wherein
he
not
only
retract
his
invitation
,
but
declare
that
he
would
never
converse
with
him
,
while
he
should
remain
within
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
obey
the
dictate
of
his
anger
,
he
give
notice
to
the
cook
,
that
he
should
not
have
occasion
for
what
be
order
;
and
repair
to
the
coffee

house

tell
the
landlord
,
that
whereas
he
understand
the
stranger
with
the
wooden
leg
have
prepossess
him
and
other
with
ridiculous
notion
,
tend
to
bring
the
sanity
of
his
intellect
in
question
;
and
,
to
confirm
this
imputation
,
have
,
under
the
pretence
of
consanguinity
,
undertake
to
defray
his
expence
;
he
could
not
help
(
in
justice
to
himself
)
<EOS>
declare
,
that
the
lame
person
be
,
in
reality
,
<EOS>
the
madman
,
who
have
give
his
keeper
the
slip
;
that
,
therefore
,
he
(
the
landlord
)
would
not
find
his
account
in
comply
with
his
order
,
and
encourage
him
to
frequent
his
house
;
and
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
would
never
enter
the
door
,
or
favour
him
with
the
least
trifle
of
his
custom
,
if
ever
he
should
,
for
the
future
,
find
himself
anticipate
in
this
payment
by
that
unhappy
lunatic

<EOS>
the
vintner
be
confound
at
this
retorted
charge
;
and
,
after
much
perplexity
and
deliberation
,
conclude
,
that
both
party
be
distract
;
the

in

a

Our

at

in
the

retire
to
his

renew
their

upon

to

that
Peregrine

be
the

deaf
batchelor
,
whom
he
have

at

the

Mr

in
his
great

discover

that
the

obstinacy
proceed
from
the
advice
of
the
Misanthrope
,
whom
,
for
that
reason
,
it
be
their
business
to
chastise
.
<EOS>
pipe
enter
into
this
opinion
the
more
willingly
,
as
he
have
all
along
believe
the
senior
to
be
a
sort
of
wizzard
,
or
some
caco
-
daemon
,
whom
it
be
not
very
creditable
to
be
acquaint
with
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
be
inspire
with
this
notion
by
the
insinuation
of
Hadgi

who
have
formerly

some
hint

profound
knowledge
in

,
his
be
possess
of
the

stone
;
an
assertion
to
which
Tom
have
give
implicit
credit
,
until
his
master
be
send
to
prison
for
debt
,
when
he
could
no
longer
suppose
Cadwallader
lord
of
such
a
valuable
secret
,
else
he
would
have
certainly
procure
the
enlargement
of
his
most
intimate
friend
.
    
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
he
espouse
the
resentment
of
Hatchway
;
and
they
determine
to
seize
the
suppose
conjurer
,
with
the
first
opportunity
,
on
his
return
from
his
visit
to
Peregrine
,
and
,
without
hesitation
,
exercise
upon
him
the
discipline
of
the

.
<EOS>
this
plan
they
would
have
execute
that
same
evening
,
have
not
the
misanthrope
luckily
withdraw
himself
,
by
accident
,
before
it
be
dark
,
and
even
before
they
have
intelligence
of
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
but
,
next
day
,
they
keep
themselves
upon
the

till
he
appear

and
Pipes
lift
his
hat

as

"
o

you

<EOS>
the

be
not
quite

fast
closed

that
they
receive
this
intimation
;
which
,
tho
'
deliver
in
term
that
he
do
not
well
understand
,
have
such
an
effect
upon
his
apprehension
,
that
he
signify
his
doubt
to
Peregrine
,
observe
,
that
he
do
not
much
like
the
look
of
that
same
ruffian
with
the
wooden
leg
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
assure
him
,
he
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
two
sailor
,
who
could
have
no
cause
of
resentment
against
him
;
or
,
if
they
have
,
would
not
venture
to
take
any
step
,
which
they
know
must
block
up
all
the
avenue
to
that
reconcilement
,
about
which
they
be
so
anxious
;
and
,
moreover
,
give
such
offence
to
the
governor
of
the
place
,
as
would
infallibly
induce
him
to
expel
them
both
from
his
territory
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
assurance
,
the
young
gentleman
be
not
so
confident
of
the
lieutenant
's
discretion
,
as
to
believe
that
Crabtree
's
fear
be
altogether
without
foundation
<EOS>
:
he
forthwith
conjecture
that
Jack
have
take
umbrage
at
an
intimacy
,
from
which
he
find
himself
exclude
,
and
impute
his
disgrace
to
the
insinuation
of
Cadwallader
,
whom
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
intend
to
punish
for
his
supposed
advice
.
<EOS>
He
know
his
friend
could
sustain
no
great
damage
from
the
lieutenant
's
resentment
,
in
a
place
which
he
could
immediately
alarm
with
his
cry
,
and
therefore
wish
he
may
fall
into
the
snare
,
because
it
would
furnish
him
with
a
pretence
of
complaint
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
sailor
would
be
oblige
to
shift
their
quarter
,
so
as
that
he
should
be
rid
of
their
company
,
in
which
he
at
present
could
find
no
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
every
thing
happen
as
he
have
foresee
;
the
misanthrope
,
in
his
retreat
from
Peregrine
's
chamber
,
be
assault
by
Hatchway
and
his
associate
,
who
seize
him
by
the
collar
without
ceremony
,
and
begin
to
drag
him
towards
the
pump
,
at
which
they
would
have
certainly
compliment
him
with
a
very
disagreeable
bath
,
have
not
he
exalt
his
voice
in
such
a
manner
,
as
in
a
moment
bring
a
number
of
the
inhabitant

Pickle
himself
to
his
aid

<EOS>
the
assailant
would
have
persist
in
their

have
the
opposition
be
such
,
as
they
could
have

with
any
possibility
of
success

do
they
quit
their

before

at

and
Peregrine
,
with
a
menacing
aspect
and
air
of
authority
,
command
his
old
valet
to
withdraw
:
then
they
think
proper
to
sheer
off
,
and
betake
themselves
to
close
quarter
,
while
our

accompany
the
affright
Cadwallader
to
the

exhibit
to

a

the

send

to
Mr

warn
him
to

for
satisfaction
within
himself

<EOS>
not
but
that
he
have
an
opportunity
of
converse
with
some
people
,
who
neither
want
sense
,
nor
be
deficient
in
point
of
principle
;
yet
there
appear
in
the
behaviour
of
them
all
,
without
exception
,
a
certain
want
of
decorum
,
a
squalor
of
sentiment
,
a
sort
of
jailish
cast
contract
in
the
course
of
confinement
,
which
disgust
the
delicacy
of
our
hero
's
observation
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
detach
himself
from
their
party
as
much
as
he
could
,
without
give
offence
to
those
among
whom
he
be
oblige
to
live
,
and
resume
his
labour
with
incredible
eagerness
and
perseverance
,
his
spirit
be
support
by
the
success
of
some
severe
Philippics
,
which
he
occasionally
publish
against
the
author
of
his
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
nor
be
his
humanity
unemployed
in
the
vacation
of
his
revenge
<EOS>
:
a
man
must
be
void
of
all
sympathy
and
compassion
,
who
can
reside
among
so
many
miserable
object
,
without
feel
an
inclination
to
relieve
their
distress
.
<EOS>
every
day
almost
present
to
his
view
such
lamentable
scene
,
as
be
most
likely
to
attract
his
notice
,
and
engage
his
benevolence
.
<EOS>
reverse
of
fortune
,
attend
with
the
most
deplorable
circumstance
of
domestic
woe
,
be
continually
intrude
upon
his
acquaintance
;
his
ear
be
invade
with
the
cry
of
the
hapless
wife
,
who
from
the
enjoyment
of
affluence
and
pleasure
,
be
force
to
follow
her
husband
to
this
abode
of
wretchedness
and
want
;
his
eye
be
every
minute
assail
with
the
naked
and
meagre
appearance
of
hunger
and
cold
;
and
his
fancy
teem
with
a
thousand
aggravation
of
their
misery
.
    
<EOS>
thus
situate
,
his
purse
be
never
shut
,
while
his
heart
remain
open
.
<EOS>
without
reflect
upon
the
slenderness
of
his
store
,
he
exercise
his
charity
to
all
the
child
of
distress
,
and
acquire
a
popularity
which
,
though
pleasing
,
be
far
from
be
profitable
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
bounty
keep
no
pace
with
his
circumstance
,
and
in
a
little
time
he
be
utterly
exhausted
.
<EOS>
He
have
recourse
to
his
bookseller
,
from
whom
,
with
great
difficulty
,
be
obtain
a
small
reinforcement
;
and
immediately
relapse
into
the
same
want
of
retention
.
<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
his
infirmity
,
and
find
it
incurable
<EOS>
:
he
foresaw
,
that
by
his
own
industry
he
should
never
be
able
to
defray
the
expence
of
these
occasion
;
and
this
reflection
sink
deep
into
his
mind
:
<EOS>
the
approbation
of
the
public
,
which
he
have
earn
or
may
acquire
,
like
a
cordial
often
repeat
,
begin
to
lose
its
effect
upon
his
imagination
;
his
health
suffer
by
his
sedentary
life
and
austere
application
;
his
eye
-
sight
fail
,
his
appetite
forsook
him
,
his
spirit
decay
;
so
that
he
become
melancholy
,
listless
,
and
altogether
incapable
of
prosecute
the
only
mean
he
have
leave
for
his
subsistence
;
and
(
what
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
alleviation
of
these
particular
)
<EOS>
he
be
give
to
understand
by
his
lawyer
,
that
he
have
lose
his
cause
,
and
be
condemn
in
cost
.
<EOS>
even
this
be
not
the
most
mortifying
piece
of
intelligence
he
receive
;
he
at
the
same
time
learn'd
,
that
his
bookseller
be
bankrupt
,
and
his
friend
Crabtree
at
the
point
of
death
.
    
<EOS>
these
be
comfortable
consideration
to
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
disposition
,
which
be
so
capricious
,
that
the
more
his
misery
increase
,
the
more
haughty
and
inflexible
he
become
.
    
<EOS>
rather
than
be
behold
to
Hatchway
,
who
still
hover
about
the
gate
,
eager
for
an
opportunity
to
assist
him
,
he
choose
to
undergo
the
want
of
almost
every
convenience
of
life
,
and
actually
pledge
his
wear
-
apparel
to
an
irish
pawn
-
broker
in
the
Fleet
,
for
money
to
purchase
those
thing
,
without
which
he
must
have
absolutely
perish
.
<EOS>
He
be
gradually
irritate
by
his
misfortune
into
a
rancorous
resentment
against
mankind
in
general
,
and
his
heart
so
alienated
from
the
enjoyment
of
life
,
that
he
do
not
care
how
soon
he
quit
his
miserable
existence
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
shocking
example
of
the
vicissitude
of
fortune
continually
before
his
eye
,
he
could
never
be
reconcile
to
the
idea
of
live
like
his
fellow
-
sufferer
,
in
the
most
abject
degree
of
dependance
.
<EOS>
if
he
refuse
to
accept
of
favour
from
his
own
ally
and
intimate
friend
,
whom
he
have
formerly
oblige
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
he
would
listen
to
proposal
of
that
kind
from
any
of
his
fellow
-
prisoner
,
with
whom
he
have
contract
acquaintance
:
he
be
even
more
cautious
than
ever
of
incur
obligation
;
he
now
shun
his
former
mess
-
mate
,
in
order
to
avoid
disagreeable
tender
of
friendship
;
and
imagine
that
he
perceive
an
inclination
in
the
clergyman
,
to
learn
the
state
of
his
finance
,
he
discourage
and
decline
the
explanation
,
and
at
length
seclude
himself
from
all

He
receive
an

pine
in
this
forlorn
condition

with
an

abhorrence

himself

captain
Gauntlet
arrive
in
town
,
in

to
employ
his
interest
for
promotion
in

and
,
in
consequence
of
his

's
particular
desire
,
make
it
his
business
to
inquire
for
Peregrine
,
to
whom
he
long
to
be
reconcile
,
even
at
the
expence
of
a
slight
submission
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
hear
no
tiding
of
him
,
at
the
place
to
which
he
be
direct
;
and
,
on
the
supposition
that
our
hero
have
go
to
reside
in
the
country
,
apply
himself
to
his
own
business
,
with
intention
to
renew
his
enquiry
,
after
that
affair
should
be
transact
.
<EOS>
He
communicate
his
demand
to
his
suppose
patron
,
who
have
assume
the
merit
of
make
him
a
captain
,
and
be
gratify
with
a
valuable
present
on
that
consideration
;
and
be
cajole
with
hope
of
succeed
in
his
present
aim
,
by
the

interest

<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while

with
one
of

to
the

office
,
whose
advice
and
assistance
,
he
be
tell
,
would
be
a
furtherance
to
his
scheme
;
and
as
he
have
occasion
to
discourse
with
this
gentleman
,
upon
the
circumstance
of
his
expectation
,
he
learn
that
the
nobleman
,
upon
whom
he
depend
,
be
a
person
of
no
consequence
in
the
state
,
and
altogether
incapable
of
assist
him
in
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
his
counsellor
express
his
surprize
that
captain
Gauntlet
do
not
rather
interest
in
his
cause
<EOS>
the
noble
peer
,
to
whose
good
office
he
owe
his
last
commission
.
    
<EOS>
this
remark
introduce
an
explanation
,
by
which
Godfrey
discover
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
,
the
mistake
in
which
he
have
continue
so
long
,
with
regard
to
his
patron
;
tho
'
he
could
not
divine
the
motive
which
induce
a
nobleman
,
with
whom
he
have
no
acquaintance
or
connection
,
to
interpose
his
influence
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
Whatsoever
that
may
be
,
he
think
it
be
his
duty
to
make
his
acknowledgment
;
and
for
that
purpose
,
go
next
morning
to
his
house
,
where
he
be
politely
receive
,
and
give
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Pickle
be
the
person
to
whose
friendship
he
be
indebted
for
his
last
promotion
.
    
<EOS>
Inexpressible
be
the
transport
of
gratitude
,
affection
,
and
remorse
,
that
take
possession
of
the
soul
of
Gauntlet
,
when
this
mystery

<EOS>
have
I
live
so
long
in
a
state
of
animosity
with
my
benefactor

I
intend
to
have
reconcile
myself
to
him
,
at
any
rate

before
I
be
sensible
of
this
obligation
;
but
now
I
shall
not
enjoy
a
moment
's
quiet
,
until
I
have
an
opportunity
of
express
to
him
my
sense
of
his
heroic
friendship

<EOS>
I
presume
,
from
the
nature
of
the
favour
confer
upon
him
,
in
my
behalf
,
that
Mr
Pickle
be
well
known
to
your
lordship

I
should
think
myself
extremely
happy
,
if
you
could
inform
me
in
what
part
of
the
country
he
be
to
be
find
:
for
the
person
with
whom
he
lodge
,
some
time
ago
,
could
give
me
no
intelligence
of
his
motion

this
instance
of
generous
self
-
denial
in
Peregrine
,
as
well
as
with
the
sensibility
of
his
friend
,
lament
the
unhappiness
of
our
hero
,
while
he
give
Gauntlet
to
understand
that
he
have
be
long
disorder
in
his
intellect
,
in
consequence
of
have
squander
away
his
fortune
;
and
that
his
creditor
have
throw
him
into
the
Fleet

prison

but
whether
he
still
continue
in
that
confinement
,
or
be
release
from

than
(
his
blood
boil
with
grief

<EOS>
he
crave
pardon
for
his
abrupt
departure
;

quit
his

the
instant

reimbarke
in
his
hackney

himself
to

<EOS>
as
the
vehicle
proceed
along
one
side
of
the
market

he
be
surprised
with
the
appearance
of
Hatchway
and
Pipes

who
stand
cheapen
collyflower
at
a
green

stall

their
head

for

the

to

to

with
an
Hilloah

behind
him

the
face
of

old
acquaintance

up
to
the
coach
with
great
eagerness

shake
the

heartily
by

"
Odd

(
say
he

<EOS>
I
be
glad
<EOS>
thou

fall
in
with

we
shall
now
be

the

neither
obey

a
'
wool
drive
under
his
bare
pole

without
sail

a
mess

<EOS>
Godfrey
be
not
only
amazed
,
but
chagrin
at
the
knowledge
of
this
anecdote
;
which
give
umbrage
to
his
pride
,
while
it
stimulate
his
desire
of
do
something
in
return
for
the
obligation

<EOS>
He
enquire
into
the
present
circumstance
of
the
prisoner
;
and
understanding
that
he
be
indispose
,
and
but
indifferently
provide
with
the
common
necessary
of
life
,
tho
'
still
deaf
to
all
offer
of
assistance
,
begin
to
be
extremely
concerned
at
the
account
of
his
savage
obstinacy
and
pride
,
which
would
,
he
fear
,
exclude
him
from
the
privilege
of
relieve
him
in
his
distress
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
resolve
to
leave
no
expedient
untrie
,
that
may
have
any
tendency
to
surmount
such
destructive
prejudice
;
and
,
enter
the
jail
,
be
direct
to
the
apartment
of
the
wretched
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
knock
softly
at
the
door
,
and
when
it
be
open
,
start
back
with
horror
and
astonishment
:
<EOS>
the
figure
that
present
itself
to
his
view
,
be
the
remain
of
his
once
happy
friend
;
but
so
miserably
altered
and
disguise
,
that
his
feature
be
scarce
cognizable
.
<EOS>
the
florid
,
the
sprightly
,
the
gay
,
the
elevated
youth
,
be
now
metamorphose
into
a
wan
,
deject
,
meagre
,
squalid
spectre
;
the
hollow
-
eyed
representative
of
distemper
,
indigence
and
despair
:
yet
his
eye
retain
a
certain
ferocity
,
which
throw
a
dismal
gleam
athwart
the
cloudiness
of
his
aspect
,
and
he
,
in
silence
,
view
his
old
companion
with
a
look
betoken
confusion
and
disdain
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
Gauntlet
,
he
could
not
,
without
emotion
,
behold
such
a
woful
reverse
of
fate
,
in
a
person
for
whom
he
entertain
the
noble
sentiment
of
friendship
,
gratitude
and
esteem
:
his
sorrow
be
at
first
too
big
for
utterance
,
and
he
shed
a
flood
of
tear
before
he
could
pronounce
one
word
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
spite
of
his
misanthropy
,
could
not
help
be
affect
with
this
uncommon
testimony
of
regard
;
but
he
strove
to
stifle
his
sensation
:
his
brow
contract
themselves
into
a
severer
frown
,
his
eye
kindle
into
the
appearance
of
live
coal
;
he
wave
with
his
hand
,
in
signal
for
Godfrey
to
be
go
,
and
leave
such
a
wretch
as
him
to
the
misery
of
his
fate
;
and
find
nature
too
strong
to
be
suppress
,
utter
a
deep
groan
,
and
weep
aloud
.
    
<EOS>
the
soldier
,
see
him
thus
melt
,
unable
to
restrain
the
strong
impulse
of
his
affection
,
sprung
forwards
,
and
clasp
him
in
his
arm

"
My

so
unhappy

,
from
this
melancholy
situation
;
of
which
,
but
an
hour
ago
,
I
be
utterly
ignorant
.
<EOS>
do
not
deny
me
the
satisfaction
of
acquit
myself
,
in
point
of
duty
and
obligation
.
<EOS>
You
must
certainly
have
have
some
regard
for
a
person
,
in
whose
favour
you
have
exert
yourself
so
much
;
and
if
any
part
of
that
esteem
remain
,
you
will
not
refuse
him
an
opportunity
of
approve
himself
,
in
some
measure
,
worthy
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
let
me
not
suffer
the
most
mortifying
of
all
repulse
,
that
of
slight
friendship
;
but
kindly
sacrifice
your
resentment
and
inflexibility
to
the
request
of
one
,
who
be
at
all
time
ready
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
your
honour
and
advantage
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
not
yield
to
my
intreatie
,
have
some
regard
to
the
wish
of
my
Sophy
,
who
lay
me
under
the
strong
injunction
to
solicit
your
forgiveness
,
even
before
she
know
how
much
I
be
indebted
to
your
generosity
;
or
,
if
that
consideration
should
be
of
no
weight
,
I
hope
you
will
relax
a
little
for
the
sake
of
poor
Emilia
,
whose
resentment
hath
be
long
subdue
by
her
affection
,
and
who
now
droop
in
secret
at
your
neglect
.
"
    
<EOS>
every
word
of
this
address
,
deliver
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
,
make
an
impression
upon
the
mind
of
Peregrine
:
he
be
affect
with
the
submission
of
his
friend
,
who
,
in
reality
,
have
give
him
no
just
cause
to
complain
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
no
ordinary
motive
have
sway
him
to
a
condescension
,
so
extraordinary
in
a
man
of
his
punctilious
temper
:
he
consider
it
,
therefore
,
as
the
genuine
effect
of
eager
gratitude
and
disintereste
love
,
and
his
heart
begin
to
relent
accordingly
.
<EOS>
when
he
hear
himself
conjure
in
the
name
of
the
gentle
Sophy
,
his
obstinacy
be
quite
overcome
;
and
when
Emilia
be
recall
to
his
remembrance
,
his
whole
frame
undergo
a
violent
agitation
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
friend
by
the
hand
,
with
a
softened
look
;
and
soon
as
he
recover
the
faculty
of
speech
,
which
have
be
overpower
in
the
conflict
of
passion
that
transport
him
,
protest
,
that
he
retain
no
vestige
of
animosity
,
but
consider
him
in
the
light
of
an
affectionate
comrade
,
the
tie
of
whose
friendship
,
adversity
could
not
unbind
.
    
<EOS>
He
mention
Sophy
in
the
most
respectful
term
;
speak
of
Emilia
with
the
most
reverential
awe
,
as
the
object
of
his
inviolable
love
and
veneration
;
but
disclaim
all
hope
of
ever
more
attract
her
regard
;
and
excuse
himself
from
profit
by
Godfrey
's
kind
intention
,
declare
,
with
a
resolute
air
,
that
he
have
break
off
all
connection
with
mankind
,
and
that
he
impatiently
long
for
the
hour
of
his
dissolution
,
which
,
if
it
should
not
soon
arrive
by
the
course
of
nature
,
he
be
resolve
to
hasten
with
his
own
hand
,
rather
than
be
expose
to
the
contempt
,
and
more
intolerable
pity
,
of
a
rascally
world
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
argue
against
this
frantic
determination
with
all
the
vehemence
of
expostulate
friendship
;
but
his
remonstrance
do
not
produce
the
desire
effect
upon
our
desperate
hero
,
who
calmly
refute
all
his
argument
,
and
assert
the
rectitude
of
his
design
from
the
pretend
maxim
of
reason
and
true
philosophy
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
dispute
be
carry
on
with
eagerness
on
one
side
,
and
deliberation
on
the
other
,
a
letter
be
bring
to
Peregrine
,
who
throw
it
carelesly
aside
unopened
,
tho
'
<EOS>
the
superscription
be
in
an
hand
-
writing
to
which
he
be
a
stranger
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
the
content
would
never
have
be
peruse
,
have
not
Gauntlet
insist
upon
his
wave
all
ceremony
,
and
read
it
forthwith
.
<EOS>
thus
solicit
,
Pickle
unseal
the
billet
,
which

to
his
no
small
surprize
,
contain
the
following
intimation
.
     
<EOS>
Mr
P
Pickle
,
SIR
<EOS>
,
this
come
to
inform
you
,
that
,
after
many
danger
and
disappointment
,
I
be
,
by
the
blessing
of
God
,
safely
arrive
in
the
Downs
,
on
board
of
the
Gomberoon
Indiaman
,
have
make
a
tolerable
voyage
;
by
which
I
hope
I
shall
be
enable
to
repay
,
with
interest
,
the
seven
hundred
pound
which
I
borrow
of
you
before
my
departure
from
England
.
<EOS>
I
take
this
opportunity
of
writing
by
our
purser
,
who
go
express
with
dispatch
for
the
company
,
that
you
may
have
this
satisfactory
notice
,
as
soon
as
possible
,
relate
to
one
whom
I
suppose
you
have
long
give
over
as
lose
.
<EOS>
I
have
inclose
it
in
a
letter
to
my
broker
,
who
,
I
hope
,
know
your
address
,
and
will
forward
it
accordingly
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
,
with
respect
,
Sir
,
 
Your
most
humble
servant
,
Benjamin
Chintz
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
take
a
cursory
view
of
this
agreeable
epistle
,
than
his
countenance
clear
up
,
and
reach
it
to
his
friend
,
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
there
(
say
he
)
be
a
more
convincing
argument
,
on
your
side
of
the
question
,
than
all
the
casuist
in
the
universe
can
advance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
wonder
at
this
observation
,
take
the
paper
,
and
cast
his
eye
greedily
upon
the
content
,
congratulate
him
upon
the
receit
of
it
,
with
extravagant
demonstration
of
joy
:
"
not
on
account
of
the
sum
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
which
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
would
,
with
pleasure
,
pay
three
time
over
for
your
convenience
and
satisfaction
;
but
because
it
seem
to
have
reconcile
you
to
life
,
and
dispose
your
mind
for
re
-
enjoy
the
comfort
of
society
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
instantaneous
effect
which
this
unexpected
smile
of
fortune
produce
in
the
appearance
of
our
adventurer
,
be
altogether
inconceivable
!
<EOS>
it
plump
up
his
cheek
in
a
moment
,
unbend
and
enlighten
every
feature
of
his
face
;
elevate
his
head
,
which
have
begin
to
sink
,
as
it
be
,
between
his
shoulder
;
and
from
a
squeak
,
dispirited
tone
,
swell
up
his
voice
to
a
clear
,
manly
accent
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
take
advantage
of
this
favourable
change
,
begin
to
regale
him
with
prospect
of
future
success
:
he
remind
him
of
his
youth
and
qualification
,
which
be
certainly
design
for
well
day
than
those
he
have
as
yet
see
;
he
point
out
various
path
,
by
which
he
may
arrive
at
wealth
and
reputation
;
he
importune
him
to
accept
of
a
sum
for
his
immediate
occasion
;
and
earnestly
beg
,
that
he
would
allow
him
to
discharge
the
debt
for
which
he
be
confine
:
observe
,
that
Sophy
's
fortune
have
enable
him
to
exhibit
that
proof
of
his
gratitude
,
without
any
detriment
to
his
affair
;
and
protest
,
that
he
should
not
believe
himself
in
possession
of
Mr
Pickle
's
esteem
,
unless
he
be
permit
to
make
some
such
return
of
good
-
will
to
the
man
,
who
have
not
only
raise
him
from
indigence
and
scorn
to
competence
and
reputable
rank
,
but
also
impowere
him
to
obtain
the
possession
of
an
excellent
woman
,
who
have
fill
up
the
measure
of
his
felicity
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
declare
himself
already
overpay
for
all
his
good
office
,
by
the
pleasure
he
enjoy
in
employ
them
,
and
the
happy
effect
they
have
produce
,
in
the
mutual
satisfaction
of
two
person
so
dear
to
his
affection
;
and
assure
his
friend
,
that
one
time
or
other
he
would
set
his
conscience
at
ease
,
and
remove
the
scruple
of
his
honour
,
by
have
recourse
to
his
assistance
:
but
,
at
present
,
he
could
not
make
use
of
his
friendship
,
without
give
just
cause
of
offence
to
honest
Hatchway
,
who
be
prior
to
him
in
point
of
solicitation
,
and
have
manifest
his
attachment
with
surprising
obstinacy
and
perseverance
.

Chapter
CX
   
<EOS>
the
captain

with
reluctance
,
yield
the
preference
in
this
particular
to
Jack
,
who
be
immediately
invite
to
a
conference
,
by
a
note
subscribe
with
Pickle
's
own
hand
.
<EOS>
He
be
find
at
the
prison
-
gate
wait
for
Gauntlet
,
to
know
the
issue
of
his
negotiation
;
and
no
sooner
receive
this
summon
than
he
set
all
his
sail
,
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
his
friend
's
apartment
;
be
admit
by
the
turnkey
,
in
consequence
of
Peregrine
's
request
,
communicate
by
the
messenger
who
carry
the
billet
.
<EOS>
pipe
follow
close
in
the
wake
of
his
shipmate
;
and
,
in
a
few
minute
after
the
note
have
be
dispatch
,
Peregrine
and
Gauntlet
hear
the
sound
of
the
stump
,
ascend
the
wooden
stair
-
case
with
such
velocity
,
that
they
at
first
mistake
it
for
the
application
of
drum
-
stick
to
the
head
of
an
empty
barrel
.
<EOS>
this
uncommon
speed
,
however
,
be
attend
with
a
misfortune
:
he
chance
to
overlook
a
small
defect
in
one
of
the
step
,
and
,
his
prop
plunge
into
a
hole
,
he
fall
backwards
,
to
the
imminent
danger
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
be
luckily
at
his
back
,
and
sustain
him
in
his
arm
,
so
as
that
he
escape
without
any
other
damage
than
the
loss
of
his
wooden
leg
,
which
be
snapt
in
the
middle
,
by
the
weight
of
his
body
,
in
fall
:
and
such
be
his
impatience
,
that
he
would
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
disengage
the
fractured
member
;
but
unbuckle
the
whole
equipage
in
a
trice
,
leave
it
stick
in
the
crevice
,
say
a
rotten
cable
be
not
worth
heave
up
,
and
,
in
this
natural
state
of
mutilation
,
hopp'd
into
the
room
with
infinite
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
take
him
cordially
by
the
hand
,
seat
him
upon
one
side
of
his
bed
;
and
after
have
make
an
apology
for
that
reserve
,
of
which
he
have
so
justly
complain
,
ask
,
if
he
could
conveniently
accommodate
him
with
the
loan
of
twenty
guinea
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
without
open
his
mouth
,
pull
out
his
purse
;
and
Pipes
,
who
overhear
the
demand
,
apply
the
whistle
to
his
lip
,
perform
a
loud
overture
,
in
token
of
his
joy
.
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
bring
to
an
accommodation
,
our
hero
tell
the
captain
,
that
he
should
be
glad
of
his
company
at
dinner
,
with
their
common
friend
Hatchway
,
if
he
would
in
the
mean
time
leave
him
to
the
ministry
of
Pipes
;
and
the
soldier
go
away
for
the
present
,
in
order
to
pay
a
short
visit
to
his
uncle
,
who
,
at
that
time
,
languish
in
a
decline
state
of
health
,
promise
to
return
at
the
appoint
hour
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
have
survey'd
the
dismal
appearance
of
his
friend
,
could
not
help
be
move
at
the
spectacle
,
and
begin
to
upbraid
him
with
his
obstinate
pride
,
which
(
he
swear
)
be
no
well
than
self
-
murder
.
    
<EOS>
but
the
young
gentleman
interrupt
him
in
the
course
of
his
moralizing
,
by
tell
him
he
have
reason
for
his
conduct
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
should
impart
in
due
season
;
but
,
at
present
,
his
design
be
to
alter
that
plan
of
behaviour
,
and
make
himself
some
amend
for
the
misery
he
have
undergo
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
send
Pipes
to
redeem
his
cloath
from
the
pawnbroker
's
wardrobe
,
and
bespeak
something
comfortable
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
and
when
Godfrey
come
back
,
he
be
very
agreeably
surprised
to
see
such
a
favourable
alteration
in
his
external
;
for
,
by
the
assistance
of
his
valet
,
he
have
purify
himself
from
the
dreg
of
his
distress
,
and
now
appear
in
a
decent
suit
,
with
clean
linnen
,
while
his
face
be
disencumber
of
the
hair
that
overshadow
it
,
and
his
apartment
prepare
for
the
reception
of
company
.
    
<EOS>
They
enjoy
their
meal
with
great
satisfaction
,
entertain
one
another
with
a
recapitulation
of
their
former
adventure
at
the
garison
;
and
in
the
afternoon
,
Gauntlet
take
his
leave
,
in
order
to
write
a
letter
to
his
sister
,
at
the
desire
of
his
uncle
,
who
find
his
end

,
want
to
see
her
without

of

,
Peregrine
make
his
appearance
on
the

and

on
his

abroad
again
,
not
only
by
his
old
mess
-
mate
,
who
have
not
see

for
many
week
,
but
by
a
number
of
those
object
whom
his
liberality
have
feed
,
before
his

be
exhaust
.
<EOS>
Hatchway

by
his

with
the

put
in
possession
of
his
former
quarter
,
and
Pipes

inquiry
about
Crabtree
at
his
former

very
severe

,
be

to
Kensington
Gravel

pit
,
for
the
convenience
of
breathe
a
purer
air
than
that
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
information
,
Peregrine
,
who
know
the
narrowness
of
the
old
gentleman
's
fortune
,
next
day
desire
his
friend
Gauntlet
to
take
the
trouble
of
visit
him
,
in
his
name
,
with
a
letter

in
which
he
express
great
concern
for

,
give
him
notice
of
the

full
authority
to
dispute
and
oppose
his
will
,
in
every
thing
that
she
should
think
prejudicial

;
for
he
be

,
by
those
who
have
the
care
of
him
,
as
an
old
humourist
,
not
a

.
<EOS>
He

about
the

,
who
(
he
say
)

,
and
that
he
be
no
longer
in
any
danger
from
the
lieutenant

resentment
,
he
promise
to
be
at
the
Fleet
with
the

that
he
be

to
him
for
his
offer
,
but
have
not
the
least
occasion
for
his
assistance

<EOS>
in
a
few
day
,
our
adventurer
recover
his
vigour
,
complexion
and
vivacity
;
he
mingle
again
in
the

and
party
of
the

he

in
a
little
time
,
the
money
he
have
lend
upon
bottomry
,
which
,
together
with
the
interest

amount
to
upward
of
eleven
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
the
possession
of
this
sum
,
while
it
buoy
up
his
spirit
,
involve
him
in
perplexity
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
him
,
as
a
man
of
honour
,
to
employ
the
great
part
of
it
,
in
diminish
the
debt
for
which
he
suffer
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
consider
that
obligation
efface
,
by
the
treacherous
behaviour
of
his
creditor
,
who
have
injure
him
to
ten
time
the

of

;
and
in
these

,
entertained
thought
of
attempt
his
escape
from
prison
,
with
a
view
of
convey
himself
,
with
the
shipwreck
of
his
fortune
,
to
another
country
,
in
which
he
may
use
it
to
well
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
both
suggestion
be
attend
with
such
doubt
and
difficulty
,
that
he
hesitate
between
them
,
and
for
the
present
,
lay
out
a
thousand
pound
in
stock
,
the
interest
of
which
,
together
with
the
fruit
of
his
own
industry
<EOS>
,
he
hope
,
would
support
him
above
want
in
his
confinement
,
until
something
should
occur
,
that
would
point
out
the
expediency
of
some
other
determination
.

still
insist
upon
have
the
honour
of
obtain
his
liberty
,
at
the
expence
of
take
up
his
note
to
Gleanum
,
and
exhort
him
to
purchase
a
commission
with
part
of
the
money
which
he
have
retrieve
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
affirm
,
that
it
be
his
privilege
to
procure
the
release
of
his
cousin
Pickle
,
because
he
enjoy
a
very
handsome
sum
by
his
aunt
,
which
of
right
belong
to
the
young
gentleman
,
to
whom
he
be
,
moreover
,
indebte
for
the
use
of
his
furniture
,
and
for
the
very
house
that
stand
over
his
head
;
and
that
,
although
he
have
already
make
a
will
in
his
favour
,
he
should
never
be
satisfied
,
nor
easy
in
his
mind
,
so
long
as
he
remain
deprive
of
his
liberty
,
and
want
any
of
the
convenience
of

Cadwallader
,
who
by
this
time
assist
at
their
council
,
and
be
best
acquaint
with
the
peculiarity
and
unbend
disposition
of
the
youth
,
propose
,
that
see
he
be
so
averse
to
obligation
,
Mr
Hatchway
should
purchase
of
him
the
garison
with
its
appendage
,
which
,
at
a
moderate
price
,
would
sell
for
more
money
than
would
be
sufficient
to
discharge
his
debt
;
and
that
,
if
the
servile
subordination
of
the
army
do
not
suit
his
inclination
,
he
may
,
with
his
reversion
,
buy
a
comfortable
annuity
,
and
retire
with
him
to
the
country
,
where
he
may
live
absolutely
independent
,
and
entertain
himself
,
as
usual
,
with
the
ridiculous
character
of
mankind
.
    
<EOS>
this
plan
be
,
to
Pickle
,
less
disagreeable
than
any
other
project
which
have
as
yet
be
suggest
;
and
the
lieutenant
declare
himself
ready
to
execute
his
part
of
it
,
without
delay
:
but
the
soldier
be
mortify
at
the
thought
of
see
his
assistance
unnecessary
,
and
eagerly
object
to
the
retirement
,
as
a
scheme
that
would
blast
the
fair
promise
of
fame
and
fortune
,
and
bury
his
youth
and
talent
in
solitude
and
obscurity
.
    
<EOS>
this
earnest
opposition
on
the
part
of
Gauntlet
,
hinder
our
adventurer
from
form
any
immediate
resolution
;
which
be
also
retard
by
his
unwillingness
to
part
with
the
garrison
upon
any
term
,
because
he
look
upon
it
as
a
part
of
his
inheritance
,
which
he
could
not
dispose
of
,
without
commit
an
insult
upon
the
memory
of
the
deceased
commodore

Chapter
CXI
<EOS>
He
be
engage
in
a
very
extraordinary
correspondence
,
which
be
interrupt
by
a
very
unexpected
event
.
   
<EOS>
while
this
affair
be
in
agitation
,
the
captain
tell
him
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
that
Emilia
be
arrive
in
town
,
and
have
enquire
about
Mr
Pickle
with
such
an
eagerness
of
concern
,
as
seem
to
proclaim
that
she
be
in
some
measure
inform
of
his
misfortune
:
he
,
therefore
,
desire
to
know
if
he
may
be
allow
to
make
her
acquaint
with
his
situation
,
provide
he
should
be
again
importune
by
her
on
that
subject
,
which
he
have
at
first
industriously
wave
.
    
<EOS>
this
proof
,
or
rather
presumption
of
her
sympathising
regard
,
do
not
fail
to
operate
powerfully
upon
the
bosom
of
Peregrine
,
which
be
immediately
fill
with
those
tumult
which
love
,
ill
stifled
,
frequently
excite
.
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
his
disgrace
be
such
as
could
not
be
effectually
conceal
;
therefore
he
see
no
reason
for
deprive
himself
of
Emilia
's
compassion
,
since
he
be
for
ever
exclude
from
her
affection
;
and
desire
Godfrey
to
present
to
his
sister
the
lowly
respect
of
a
despairing
lover
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
his
declaration
of
despondence
on
this
head
,
his
imagination
involuntarily
teem
with
more
agreeable
idea
:
the
proposal
of
Crabtree
have
take
root
in
his
reflection
,
and
he
could
not
help
form
plan
of
pastoral
felicity
,
in
the
arm
of
the
lovely
Emilia
,
remote
from
those
pompous
scene
,
which
he
now
detest
and
despise
.
<EOS>
He
amuse
his
fancy
with
the
prospect
of
be
able
to
support
her
in
a
state
of
independency
,
by
mean
of
the
slender
annuity
which
it
be
in
his
power
to
purchase
,
together
with
the
fruit
of
those
endeavour
,
which
would
profitably
employ
his
vacant
hour
;
and
foresaw
provision
for
his
grow
family
in
the
friendship
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
have
already
constitute
him
his
heir
.
<EOS>
He
even
parcel
out
his
hour
,
among
the
necessary
care
of
the
world
,
the
pleasure
of
domestic
bliss
,
and
the
enjoyment
of
a
country
life
;
and
spend
the
night
in
ideal
party
with
his
charming
bride
,
sometimes
walk
by
the
sedgy
bank
of
some
transparent
stream
,
sometimes
prune
the
luxuriant
vine
,
and
sometimes
sit
in
social
converse
with
her
,
in
a
shady
grove
of
his
own
planting
.
    
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
no
more
than
the
shadowy
phantom
of
imagination
,
which
,
he
well
know
,
would
never
be
realize
:
not
that
he
believe
such
happiness
unattainable
by
a
person
in
his
circumstance
;
but
because
he
would
not
stoop
to
propose
a
scheme
,
which
may
,
in
any
shape
,
seem
to
interfere
with
the
interest
of
Emilia
,
or
subject
himself
to
a
repulse
from
that
young
lady
,
who
have
reject
his
address
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
divert
himself
with
these
agreeable
reverie
,
an
unexpected
event
intervene
,
in
which
she
and
her
brother
be
deeply
interested
.
    
<EOS>
the
uncle
be
tap
for
the
dropsy
,
and
die
in
a
few
day
after
the
operation
;
have
bequeath
,
in
his
will
,
five
thousand
pound
to
his
nephew
,
and
twice
that
sum
to
his
niece
,
who
have
always
enjoy
the
great
share
of
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
if
our
adventurer
,
before
this
occurrence
,
look
upon
his
love
for
Emilia
as
a
passion
which
it
be
necessary
,
at
any
rate
,
to
conquer
or
suppress
;
he
now
consider
her
accession
of
fortune
as
a
circumstance
which
confirm
that
necessity
,
and
resolve
to
discourage
every
thought
on
that
subject
,
which
should
tend
to
the
propagation
of
hope
:
when
one
day
,
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
calculate
for
the
purpose
,
Godfrey
put
into
his
hand
a
letter
direct
to
Mr
Pickle
,
in
the
hand
-
writing
of
Emilia
;
which
the
youth
no
sooner
recognize
,
than
his
cheek
be
convere
with
a
crimson
dye
,
and
he
begin
to
tremble
with
violent
agitation
:
for
he
,
at
once
,
guess
the
import
of
the
billet
,
which
he
kiss
with
great
reverence
and
devotion
,
and
be
not
at
all
surprised
when
he
read
the
follow
word
.
    
<EOS>
SIR
,
I
have
perform
a
sufficient
sacrifice
to
my
reputation
,
in
retain
hitherto
the
appearance
of
that
resentment
,
which
I
have
long
ago
dismiss
;
and
as
the
late
favourable
change
in
my
situation
,
impower
me
to
avow
my
genuine
sentiment
,
without
fear
of
censure
,
or
suspicion
of
mercenary
design
,
I
take
this
opportunity
to
assure
you
,
that
if
I
still
maintain
that
place
in
your
heart
,
which
I
be
vain
enough
to
think
I
once
possess
,
I
be
willing
to
make
the
first
advance
to
an
accommodation
;
and
have
actually
furnish
my
brother
with
full
power
to
conclude
it
,
in
the
name
of
your
appeased
 
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
have
kiss
the
subscription
with
great
ardour
,
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
lift
up
his
eye
,
"
thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
,
with
an
air
of
transport
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
mistake
in
my
opinion
of
that
generous
maid
.
<EOS>
I
believe
her
inspire
with
the
most
dignified
and
heroic
sentiment
,
and
now
she
give
me
a
convincing
proof
of
her
magnanimity
:
it
be
now
my
business
to
approve
myself
worthy
of
her
regard
.
<EOS>
May
heaven
inflict
upon
me
the
keen
arrow
of
its
vengeance
,
if
I
do
not
,
at
this
instant
,
contemplate
the
character
of
Emilia
with
the
most
perfect
love
and
adoration
;
yet
,
amiable
and
inchanting
as
she
be
,
I
be
,
more
than
ever
,
determine
to
sacrifice
the
interest
of
my
passion
to
my
glory
,
tho
'
<EOS>
my
life
should
fail
in
the
contest
;
and
even
to
refuse
an
offer
,
which
,
otherwise
,
the
whole
universe
should
not
bribe
me
to
forego
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
be
not
so
unexpected
as
unwelcome
to
his
friend
Gauntlet
,
who
represent
that
his
glory
be
not
at
all
interest
in
the
affair
;
because
he
have
already
vindicate
his
generosity
,
in
repeat
proffer
to
lay
his
whole
fortune
at
Emilia
's
foot
,
when
it
be
impossible
that
any
thing
selfish
could
enter
into
the
proposal
:
but
that
,
in
reject
her
present
purpose
,
he
would
give
the
world
an
opportunity
to
say
that
his
pride
be
capricious
,
his
obstinacy
invincible
,
and
his
sister
undeniable
reason
to
believe
,
that
either
his
passion
for
her
be
dissemble
,
or
the
ardour
of
it
considerably
abate
.
    
<EOS>
in
answer
to
these
remonstrance
,
Pickle
observe
,
that
he
have
long
set
the
world
at
defiance
;
and
as
to
the
opinion
of
Emilia
,
he
do
not
doubt
that
she
would
applaud
,
in
her
heart
,
the
resolution
he
have
take
,
and
do
justice
to
the
purity
of
his
intention
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
an
easy
task
to
divert
our
hero
from
his
design
,
at
any
time
of
life
;
but
,
since
his
confinement
,
his
inflexibility
be
become
almost
insurmountable
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
therefore
,
after
have
discharge
his
conscience
,
in
assure
him
that
his
sister
's
happiness
be
at
stake
,
that
his
mother
have
approve
of
the
step
she
have
take
,
and
that
he
himself
should
be
extremely
mortify
at
his
refusal
,
forbore
to
press
him
with
further
argument
,
which
serve
only
to
rivet
him
the
more
strongly
in
his
own
opinion
;
and
undertake
to
deliver
this
answer
to
Emilia
's
letter
.
    
<EOS>
Madam
,
that
I
revere
the
dignity
of
your
virtue
with
the
utmost
veneration
,
and
love
you
infinitely
more
than
life
,
I
be
at
all
time
ready
to
demonstrate
:
but
the
sacrifice
to
honour
,
it
be
now
my
turn
to
pay
,
and
such
be
the
rigour
of
my
destiny
,
that
,
in
order
to
justify
your
generosity
,
I
must
refuse
to
profit
by
your
condescension
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
be
doom
to
be
for
ever
wretched
;
and
to
sigh
,
without
cease
,
for
the
possession
of
that
jewel
,
which
,
tho
'
now
in
my
offer
,
I
dare
not
enjoy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
express
the
anguish
that
tear
my
heart
,
whilst
I
communicate
this
fatal
renunciation
;
but
appeal
to
the
delicacy
of
your
own
sentiment
,
which
can
judge
of
my
suffering
,
and
will
,
doubtless
,
do
justice
to
the
self
-
denial
of
your
forlorn
 
P
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
who
know
the
nicety
of
our
hero
's
pride
,
have
foresee
the
purport
of
this
epistle
,
before
it
come
to
her
hand
:
she
do
not
,
therefore
,
despair
of
success
,
nor
desist
from
the
prosecution
of
her
plan
;
which
be
no
other
than
that
of
secure
her
own
happiness
,
in
espouse
the
man
upon
whom
she
have
fix
her
unalterable
affection
.
<EOS>
confident
of
his
honour
,
and
fully
satisfied
of
the
mutual
passion
with
which
they
be
inspire
,
she
gradually
decoy
him
into
a
literary
correspondence
,
wherein
she
attempt
to
refute
the
argument
on
which
he
ground
his
refusal
;
and
,
without
doubt
,
the
young
gentleman
be
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
enjoyment
of
such
delightful
commerce
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
have
(
more
than
ever
)
an
opportunity
of
admire
the
poignancy
of
her
wit
,
and
the
elegance
of
her
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
the
contemplation
of
such
excellency
,
while
it
strengthen
the
chain
with
which
she
hold
him
enslave
,
add
emulation
to
the
other
motive
that
induce
him
to
maintain
the
dispute
;
and
much
subtlety
of
reasoning
be
expend
upon
both
side
of
this
very
particular
question
,
without
any
prospect
of
conviction
on
either
part
:
'
till
,
at
last
,
she
begin
to
despair
of
make
him
a
proselyte
to
her
opinion
by
dint
of
argument
;
and
resolve
,
for
the
future
,
to
apply
herself
chiefly
to
the
irresistible
prepossession
of
his
love
,
which
be
not
at
all
diminish
or
impair
by
the
essay
of
her
pen
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
view
she
propose
a
conference
,
pretend
that
it
be
impossible
to
convey
all
her
reflection
,
upon
this
subject
,
in
a
series
of
short
letter
;
and
Godfrey
undertake
to
bail
him
for
the
day
:
but
,
conscious
of
her
power
,
he
would
not
trust
himself
in
her
presence
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
heart
throb
with
all
the
eagerness
of
desire
to
see
her
fair
eye
disrobe
of
that
resentment
which
they
have
wear
so
long
,
and
to
enjoy
the
ravish
sweet
of
a
fond
reconciliation
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
could
not
have
hold
out
against
such
powerful
attack
,
have
not
the
pride
and
caprice
of
his
disposition
be
gratify
to
the
full
in
the
triumph
of
his
resistance
:
he
look
upon
the
contest
as
altogether
original
,
and
persevere
with
obstinacy
,
because
he
think
himself
sure
of
favourable
term
,
whenever
he
should
be
dispose
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
have
overshot
himself
,
in
the
course
of
his
perseverance
:
a
young
lady
of
Emilia
's
fortune
and
attraction
,
could
not
fail
to
find
herself
surround
by
temptation
,
which
few
woman
can
resist
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
misinterpret
the
meaning
of
some
paragraph
,
or
take
umbrage
at
an
unguarded
expression
in
one
of
Peregrine
's
letter
:
she
may
have
be
tire
out
by
his
obstinate
peculiarity
,
or
,
at
the
long
run
,
construe
it
into
madness
,
flight
,
or
indifference
;
or
,
rather
than
waste
her
prime
in
fruitless
endeavour
to
subdue
the
pride
of
an
headstrong
humorist
,
listen
to
the
voice
of
some
admirer
,
fraught
with
qualification
sufficient
to
engage
her
esteem
and
affection
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
possibility
be
providentially
prevent
by
an
accident
,
attend
with
more
important
consequence
than
any
we
have
hitherto
recount
.
    
<EOS>
early
one
morning
,
Pipes
be
disturb
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
,
who
have
be
send
express
from
the
country
by
Mr
Clover
,
with
a
packet
for
the
lieutenant
,
and
arrive
in
town
overnight
;
but
as
he
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
the
information
of
Jack
's
correspondent
in
the
city
,
touch
the
place
of
his
abode
,
before
he
demand
entrance
at
the
Fleet
,
the
gate
be
shut
;
nor
would
the
turnkey
admit
him
,
altho
'
<EOS>
he
tell
them
,
that
he
be
charge
with
a
message
of
the
utmost
consequence
;
so
that
he
be
fain
to
tarry
'
till
day
-
break
,
when
he
,
at
his
earnest
solicitation
,
be
allow
to
enter
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
open
the
packet
,
find
a
letter
inclose
for
Peregrine
,
with
an
earnest
request
,
that
he
would
forward
it
to
the
hand
of
that
young
gentleman
with
all
possible
dispatch
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
could
not
dive
into
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
injunction
,
begin
to
imagine
that
Mrs
Clover
lie
at
the
point
of
death
,
and
want
to
take
her
last
farewel
of
her
brother
;
and
this
conceit
work
so
strongly
upon
his
imagination
,
that
,
while
he
huddle
on
his
cloath
,
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
the
apartment
of
our
hero
,
he
could
not
help
curse
,
within
himself
,
the
folly
of
the
husband
in
send
such
disagreeable
message
to
a
man
of
Peregrine
's
impatient
temper
,
already
sour
by
his
own
uneasy
situation
.
    
<EOS>
this
reflection
would
have
induce
him
to
suppress
the
letter
,
have
not
he
be
afraid
to
tamper
with
the
ticklish
disposition
of
his
friend
,
to
whom
,
while
he
deliver
it
,
"
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
mayhap
<EOS>
I
may
have
as
much
natural
affection
as
another
;
<EOS>
but
,
when
my
spouse
part
,
I
bear
my
misfortune
like
a
british
man
and
a
Christian
:
for
,
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
he
be
no
well
than
a
fresh
-
water
sailor
,
who
know
not
how
to
stem
the
current
of
mischance
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
be
wake
from
a
pleasant
dream
,
in
which
the
fair
Emilia
be
principally
concern
,
and
,
hear
this
strange
preamble
,
sit
up
in
his
bed
,
and
unseal
the
letter
,
in
a
state
of
mortification
and
disgust
:
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
emotion
of
his
soul
,
when
he
read
the
following
intimation
!
    
<EOS>
dear
brother
,
It
hath
please
God
to
take
your
father
suddenly
off
,
by
a
fit
of
the
apoplexy
;
and
as
he
have
die
intestate
,
I
give
you
this
notice
,
that
you
may
,
with
all
speed
,
come
down
and
take
possession
of
your
right
,
in
despite
of
master
Gam
and
his
mother
,
who
,
you
may
be
sure
,
do
not
sit
easy
under
this
unexpected
dispensation
of
providence
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
by
virtue
of
be
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
take
such
precaution
as
I
think
necessary
for
your
advantage
;
and
the
funeral
shall
be
defer
until
your
pleasure
be
know
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
,
tho
'
sincerely
afflict
with
her
father
's
fate
,
submit
to
the
will
of
heaven
with
laudable
resignation
,
and
beg
you
will
set
out
for
this
place
without
delay
;
in
which
request
she
be
join
by
,
Sir
,
 
Your
affectionate
brother
,
and
humble
servant
,
Charles
Clover
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
at
first
,
look
upon
this
epistle
as
a
meer
illusion
of
the
brain
,
and
a
continuation
of
the
reverie
in
which
he
have
be
engage
.
    
<EOS>
He
read
it
ten
time
over
,
without
be
persuade
that
he
be
actually
awake
:
he
rub
his
eye
,
and
shake
his
head
,
in
order
to
shake
off
the
drowsy
vapour
that
surround
him
:
he
hemm'd
thrice
with
great
vociferation
,
snapp'd
<EOS>
his
finger
,
tweak'd
<EOS>
his
nose
,
start
up
from
his
bed
,
and
,
open
the
casement
,
take
a
survey
of
the
well
-
know
object
that
appear
on
each
side
of
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
every
thing
seem
congr'ous
and
connected
,
and
he
say
,
within
himself
,
"
sure
this
be
the
most
distinct
dream
that
ever
sleep
produce
.
<EOS>
then
he
have
recourse
again
to
the
paper
,
which
he
carefully
peruse
,
without
find
any
variation
from
his
first
notion
of
the
content
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
see
all
this
extravagance
of
action
,
accompany
with
a
wild
stare
of
distraction
,
begin
to
believe
that
his
head
be
at
length
fairly
turn
,
and
be
really
meditate
mean
for
secure
his
person
;
when
Pickle
,
in
a
tone
of
surprize
,
exclaim
,
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
be
I
,
or
be
I
not
awake
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
ye
,
cousin
Pickle
,
(
reply
the
lieutenant
)
<EOS>
that
be
a
question
which
the
deep
sea
-
line
of
my
understanding
be
not
long
enough
to
sound
:
but
,
howsomever
,
tho'f
<EOS>
I
can
not
trust
to
the
observation
I
have
take
,
it
shall
go
hard
<EOS>
but
I
will
fall
upon
a
way
to
guess
whereabout
we
be
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
lift
up
a
pitcher
full
of
cold
water
,
that
stand
behind
the
outward
door
,
and
discharge
it
in
the
face
of
Peregrine
,
without
ceremony
or
hesitation
.
    
<EOS>
this
remedy
produce
the
desire
effect
:
unpalatable
as
it
be
,
the
young
gentleman
no
sooner
recover
his
breath
,
which
be
endanger
by
such
a
sudden
application
,
than
he
<EOS>
thank'd
<EOS>
his
friend
Jack
for
the
seasonable
operation
he
have
perform
;
and
have
no
longer
any
just
reason
to
doubt
the
reality
of
what
appeal
so
convincingly
to
his
sense
,
he
shift
himself
on
the
instant
,
not
without
hurry
and
trepidation
;
and
put
on
his
morning
-
dress
,
sally
forth
to
the
bear
,
in
order
to
deliberate
with
himself
on
the
important
intelligence
he
have
receive
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
not
yet
fully
convince
of
his
sanity
,
and
curious
to
know
the
purport
of
the
letter
,
which
have
affect
him
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
,
carefully
attend
his
footstep
in
this
excursion
,
in
hope
of
be
favour
with
his
confidence
,
in
the
course
of
their
perambulation
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
no
sooner
appear
at
the
street
-
door
,
than
he
be
salute
by
the
messenger
,
who
have
post
himself
in
the
way
for
that
purpose
,
"
God
bless
your
noble
honour
,
squire
Pickle
,
(
cry
he
)
and
give
you
joy
of
succeed
to
your
father
's
estate
.
<EOS>
"
these
word
have
scarce
proceed
from
his
mouth
,
when
the
lieutenant
hop
eagerly
towards
the
countryman
,
squeeze
his
hand
with
great
affection
,
and
ask
if
the
old
gentleman
have
actually
take
his
departure
:
"
ay
,
master
Hatchway
,
(
reply
the
other
)
in
such
a
woundy
haste
,
that
he
forget
to
make
a
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
body
of
me
!
<EOS>
(
exclaim
the
seaman
)
<EOS>
these
be
the
good
tiding
I
have
hear
since
I
first
go
to
sea
.
<EOS>
here
,
my
lad
,
take
my
purse
,
and
stow
thyself
chocque
-
full
of
the
good
liquor
in
the
land
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
tip
the
peasant
with
ten
piece
,
and
immediately
the
whole
place
ecchoe
with
the
sound
of
Tom
's
instrument
;
while
Peregrine
,
repair
to
the
walk
,
communicate
the
billet
to
his
honest
friend
,
who
,
at
his
desire
,
go
forthwith
to
the
lodging
of
captain
Gauntlet
,
and
return
in
less
than
half
an
hour
with
that
gentleman
,
who
(
I
need
not
say
)
be
heartily
rejoice
at
the

Chapter
CXII
   
<EOS>
nor
do
our
hero
keep
the
misanthrope
in
ignorance
of
this
happy
turn
of
fortune
:
Pipes
be
dispatch
to
the
senior
,
with
a
message
request
his
immediate
presence
;
and
he
accordingly
appear
,
in
obedience
to
the
summon
,
growl
with
discontent
,
for
have
be
deprive
of
several
hour
of
his
natural
rest
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
be
immediately
stop
with
the
letter
,
at
which
he
smile
horrible
a
ghastly
grin
;
and
,
after
a
compliment
of
congratulation
,
they
enter
into
close
divan
,
about
the
measure
to
be
take
in
consequence
of
this
event
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
no
room
for
much
debate
:
it
be
unanimously
agree
,
that
Pickle
should
set
out
,
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
for
the
garison
,
to
which
Gauntlet
and
Hatchway
resolve
to
attend
him
;
and
Pipes
be
accordingly
order
to
prepare
a
couple
of
post
-
chaise
,
while
Godfrey
go
to
procure
bail
for
his
friend
,
and
provide
them
with
money
for
the
expence
of
the
expedition
,
but
not
before
he
be
desire
by
Peregrine
to
conceal
this
piece
of
news
from
his
sister
,
that
our
youth
may
have
an
opportunity
to
surprise
her
in
a
more
interesting
manner
,
after
he
should
have
settle
his
affair
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
previous
step
be
take
in
less
than
an
hour
,
our
hero
take
his
leave
of
the
Fleet
,
after
he
have
leave
twenty
guinea
with
the
warden
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
prisoner
,
a
great
number
of
whom
convey
him
to
the
gate
,
pour
forth
prayer
for
his
long
life
and
prosperity
;
and
he
take
the
road
to
the
garison
,
in
the
most
elevated
transport
of
joy
,
unallayed
with
the
least
mixture
of
grief
at
the
death
of
a
parent
whose
paternal
tenderness
he
have
never
know
;
so
that
his
breast
be
absolutely
a
stranger
to
<EOS>
that
boast
 
Storgh
,
or
instinct
of
affection
,
by
which
the
charity
be
suppose
to

<EOS>
of
all
the
journey
he
have
ever
make
,
this
,
sure
,
be
the
most
delightful
:
he
feel
all
the
extasy
that
must
naturally
be
produce
in
a
young
man
of
his
imagination
,
from
such
a
sudden
transition
,
in
point
of
circumstance
;
he
find
himself
deliver
from
confinement
and
disgrace
,
without
be
oblige
to
any
person
upon
earth
for
his
deliverance
;
he
have
it
now
in
his
power
to
retort
the
contempt
of
the
world
,
in
a
manner
suit
to
his
most
sanguine
wish
;
he
be
reconcile
to
his
friend
,
and
enable
to
gratify
his
love
,
even
upon
his
own
term
;
and
see
himself
in
possession
of
a
fortune
more
ample
than
his
first
inheritance
,
with
a
stock
of
experience
that
would
steer
him
clear
of
all
those
quicksand
among
which
he
have
be
formerly
wreck
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
their
journey
,
while
they
halt
at
an
inn
for
a
short
refreshment
and
change
of
horse
,
a
postilion
run
up
to
Peregrine
in
the
yard
,
and
fall
at
his
foot
,
clasp
his
knee
with
great
eagerness
and
agitation
,
and
present
to
him
the
individual
face
of
his
old
valet
de
chambre
.
<EOS>
the
youth
perceive
him
in
such
an
abject
garb
and
attitude
,
command
him
to
rise
,
and
tell
the
cause
of
such
a
miserable
reverse
in
his
fortune

<EOS>
upon
which
Hadgi
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
be
ruin
by
his

who
have
rob

of
all
his

and
valuable

have
elope
from

with
one
of
his

who
appear
in
the
character
of
a
french
count
,
but
be
in
reality
no
other
than
an
italian
fidler
;
that
,
in
consequence
of
this
retreat
,
he
(
the
husband

be
disable
from
pay
a
considerable
sum
which
he

apart
for
his

merchant

who
be
disappoint
in
his
expectation
,
take
out
an
extent
against
his
effect
;
and
the
rest
of
his
creditor
follow
his
example
,
hunt
him
out
of
house
and
home
:
so
that
,
find
his
person
in
danger
at
London
,
he
have
be
oblige
to
escape
into
the
country
,
skulk
about
from
one
village
to
another
,
till
be
quite
destitute
of
all

,
he
have
undertake
his
present
office
,
to
save

from
starve

<EOS>
Peregrine
listen
with
compassion
to
his
lamentable
tale
,
which
too
well
account
for
his
not
appear
in
the
Fleet
,
with
offer
of
service
to
his
master
in
distress
,
a
circumstance
that
Pickle
have
all
along
impute
to
his
avarice
and
ingratitude
;
and
he
assure
him
,
that
as
he
have
be
the
mean
of
throw
in
his
way
the
temptation
to
which
he
fall
a
sacrifice
,
he
would
charge
himself
with
the
retrieval
of
his
affair
:
in
the
mean
time
,
he
make
him
taste
of
his
bounty
,
and
desire
him
to
continue
in
his
present
employment
,
until
he
should
return
from
the
garison
,
when
he
would
consider
his
situation
,
and
do
something
for
his
immediate
relief
.
    
<EOS>
Hadgi
attempt
to
kiss
his
shoe
,
and
weep
,
or
affect
to
weep
,
with
sensibility
,
at
this
gracious
reception
;
he
even
make
a
merit
of
his
unwillingness
to
exercise
his
new
occupation
,
and
earnestly
beg
that
he
may
be
allow
to
give
immediate
attendance
upon
his
dear
master
,
from
whom
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
a
second
parting

His

garison

straightway
to
his
father

house
;
and

to

him
,
not
even
a

care
of
his
chaise
,
he
dismount
without

and

into
the
hall

where

a
bell

rope
,
he
make
immediate
application
to
it
,
in
such
a
manner
as
bring
a
couple
of
footman
into
his
presence
.
<EOS>
after
have
reprimand
them
,
with
a
stern
look
,
for
their
neglect
,
in
point
of
attendance
,
he
command
them
to
shew
him
into
an
apartment
;
and
,
as
they
seem
unwilling
to
yield
obedience
to
his
order
,
ask
if
they
do
not
belong
to
the
family
?
    
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
who
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
spokesman
,
reply
with
a
sullen
air
,
that
they
have
be
in
the
service
of
old
Mr
Pickle
,
and
now
that
he
be
dead
,
think
themselves
bind
to
obey
no
body
but
their
lady
,
and
her
son
Mr
Gamaliel
.
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
have
scarce
proceed
from
his
mouth
,
when
our
hero
give
them
to
understand
,
that
since
they
be
not
dispose
to
own
any
other
master
,
they
must
change
their
quarter
immediately
;
and
order
them
to
decamp
without
further
preparation
:
<EOS>
and
as
they
still
continue
restiff
,
they
be
kick
out
of
door
by
the
captain
and
his
friend
Hatchway
.
<EOS>
Squire
Gam
,
who
overhear
every
thing
that
pass
,
and
be
now
more
than
ever
inflame
with
that
rancour
which
he
have
suck
with
his
mother
's
milk
,
fly
to
the
assistance
of
his
adherent
,
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
,
bellow
thief
!
<EOS>
thief
!
<EOS>
with
great
vociferation
,
as
if
he
have
mistake
the
business
of
the
stranger
,
and
actually
believe
himself
in
danger
of
be
rob
.
<EOS>
under
this
pretence
he
discharge
a
piece
at
his
brother
,
who
luckily
escape
the
shot
,
close
with
him
in
a
moment
,
and
wrest
the
other
pistol
from
his
gripe
,
turn
him
out
into
the
court
-
yard
,
to
the
consolation
of
his
two
dependant
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Pipes
and
the
two
postilion
have
take
possession
of
the
stable
,
without
be
oppose
by
the
coachman
and
his
deputy
,
who
quietly
submit
to
the
authority
of
their
new
sovereign
;
but
the
noise
of
the
pistol
have
alarm
Mrs
Pickle
,
who
run
down
stair
,
with
the
most
frantic
appearance
,
attend
by
two
maid
and
the
curate
,
who
still
maintain
his
place
of
chaplain
and
ghostly
director
in
the
family
,
would
have
assault
our
hero
with
her
nail
,
have
not
she
be
restrain
by
her
attendant
,
who
,
tho
'
they
prevent
her
from
use
her
hand
,
could
not
hinder
her
from
exercise
her
tongue
,
which
she
wag
against
him
with
all
the
virulence
of
malice
.
    
<EOS>
She
ask'd
,
<EOS>
if
he
be
come
to
butcher
his
brother
,
to
insult
his
father
's
corpse
,
and
triumph
in
her
affliction
;
she
bestow
upon
him
the
epithet
of
spendthrift
,
jailbird
,
and
unnatural
ruffian
;
she
begg'd
pardon
of
God
for
have
bring
such
a
monster
into
the
world
,
accuse
him
of
have
bring
his
father
's
grey
hair
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
;
and
affirm
,
that
be
he
to
touch
the
body
,
it
would
bleed
at
his
approach
.
    
<EOS>
without
pretend
to
refute
the
article
of
this
ridiculous
charge
,
he
allow
her
to
ring
out
her
alarm
;
and
then
calmly
reply
,
that
if
she
do
not
quietly
retire
to
her
chamber
,
and
behave
as
become
a
person
in
her
present
situation
,
he
should
insist
upon
her
remove
to
another
lodging
,
without
delay
;
for
he
be
determined
to
be
master
in
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
expect
that
he
would
endeavour
to
appease
her
with
all
the
tenderness
of
filial
submission
,
be
so
much
exasperate
at
his
cavalier
behaviour
,
that
her
constitution
could
not
support
the
transport
of
her
spirit
;
and
she
be
carry
off
by
her
woman
,
in
a
fit
,
while
the
officious
clergyman
be
dismiss'd
<EOS>
after
his
pupil
,
with
all
the
circumstance
of
disgrace
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
have
thus
make
his
quarter
good
,
take
possession
of
the
good
apartment
in
the
house
,
and
send
notice
of
his
arrival
to
Mr
Clover
,
who
,
with
his
wife
,
visit
him
in
less
than
an
hour
,
and
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
him
so
suddenly
settle
in
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
the
meeting
of
Julia
and
her
brother
be
extremely
pathetic
.
    
<EOS>
She
have
always
love
him
with
uncommon
tenderness
,
and
look
upon
him
as
the
ornament
of
her
family
;
but
she
have
hear
of
his
extravagancy
with
regret
,
and
tho
'
<EOS>
she
consider
the
story
that
be
circulate
at
his
expence
,
as
the
malicious
exaggeration
of
his
mother
and
her
darle
son
,
her
apprehension
have
be
grievously
alarm
by
an
account
of
his
imprisonment
and
distress
,
which
have
be
accidentally
convey
to
that
country
by
a
gentleman
from
London
,
who
have
be
formerly
of
his
acquaintance
:
she
could
not
,
therefore
,
without
the
most
tender
emotion
of
joy
,
see
him
,
as
it
be
,
restore
to
his
rightful
inheritance
,
and
re
-
establish
in
that
station
of
life
which
she
think
he
could
fill
with
dignity
and
importance
.
    
<EOS>
after
their
mutual
expression
of
affection
,
she
retire
to
her
mother
's
chamber
,
with
a
view
to
make
a
second
offer
of
her
service
and
attendance
,
which
have
be
already
reject
with
scorn
since
her
father
's
death
;
while
Peregrine
consult
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
about
the
affair
of
the
family
,
so
far
as
they
have
fall
within
his
cognizance
and
observation
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Clover
tell
him
,
that
though
he
be
never
favour
with
the
confidence
of
the
defunct
,
he
know
some
of
his
intimate
,
who
have
be
tamper
with
by
Mrs
Pickle
,
and
even
engage
to
second
the
remonstrance
by
which
she
have
often
endeavour
to
persuade
her
husband
to
settle
his
affair
by
a
formal
will
;
but
that
he
have
from
time
to
time
evade
their
importunity
with
surprising
excuse
of
procrastination
,
that
plainly
appear
to
be
the
result
of
invention
and
design
,
far
above
the
suppose
pitch
of
his
capacity
;
a
circumstance
from
which
Mr
Clover
conclude
,
that
the
old
gentleman
imagine
his
life
would
not
have
be
secure
,
have
he
once
take
such
a
step
as
must
have
render
it
unnecessary
to
the
independence
of
his
second
son
.
    
<EOS>
He
moreover
observe
,
that
,
in
consequence
of
this
information
,
he
no
sooner
hear
of
Mr
Pickle
's
death
,
which
happen
at
the
club
,
than
he
go
directly
,
with
a
lawyer
,
to
his
house
,
before
any
cabal
or
conspiracy
could
be
form
against
the
rightful
heir
;
and
,
in
presence
of
witness
provide
for
the
purpose
,
seal
up
all
the
paper
of
the
deceased
,
after
the
widow
have
,
in
the
first
transport
of
her
sorrow
and
vexation
,
fairly
own
,
that
her
husband
have
die
intestate
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
be
extremely
well
satisfied
with
this
intelligence
,
by
which
all
his
doubt
be
dispel
,
and
have
chearfully
sup
with
his
friend
on
a
cold
collation
which
his
brother
-
in
-
law
have
bring
in
his
chariot
,
they
retire
to
rest
,
in
different
chamber
,
after
Julia
have
meet
with
another
repulse
from
her
capricious
mother
,
whose
overflow
rage
have
now
subside
into
the
former
channel
of
calm
inveteracy
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
house

some
servant
from
the

to
demand
his
mother

with
his

cloath

and
her
personal

<EOS>
Our
hero
,
tho

he
would
not
suffer
him
to
enter
the
door
,
allow
his
proposal
to

to

that

and

with
the

and
park
adjacent
,
to
a
very
considerable
extent
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
sum
that
even
exceed
his
expectation
,
and
could
not
fail
to
entertain
his
fancy
with
the
most
agreeable
idea
.
<EOS>
He
find
himself
immediately
a
man
of
vast
consequence
among
his
country
neighbour
,
who
visit
him
with
compliment
of
congratulation
,
and
treat
him
with
such
respect
as
would
have
effectually
spoil
any
young
man
of
his
disposition
,
who
have
not
the
same
advantage
of
experience
as
he
have
already
purchase
at
a
very
extravagant
price
.
    
<EOS>
thus
shield
with
caution
,
he
bear
his
prosperity
with
surprising
temperance
;
every
body
be
charm
with
his
affability
and
moderation
;
and
when
he
make
a
circuit
round
the
gentleman
of
the
district
,
<EOS>
in
order
to
repay
the
courtesy
which
he
owe
,
he
be
caress
by
them
with
uncommon
assiduity
,
and
advise
to
offer
himself
as
a
candidate
for
the
county
,
at
the
next
election
,
which
,
they
suppose
,
would
soon
happen
,
because
the
present
member
be
in
a
decline
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
nor
do
his
person
and
address
escape
unheede
by
the
lady
,
many
of
whom
do
not
scruple
to
spread
their
attraction
before
him
,
with
a
view
of
captivate
such
a
valuable
prize
:
nay
,
such
an
impression
do
this
legacy
make
upon
a
certain
peer
,
who
reside
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
that
he
cultivate
Pickle
's
acquaintance
with
great
eagerness
,
and
,
without
circumlocution
,
offer
to
him
in
marriage
<EOS>
his
only
daughter
,
with
a
very
considerable
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
express
himself
,
upon
this
occasion
,
as
become
a
man
of
honour
,
sensibility
and
politeness
;
and
frankly
give
his
lordship
to
understand
,
that
his
heart
be
already
engage
.
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
with
the
opportunity
of
make
such
a
sacrifice
to
his
passion
for
Emilia
,
which
,
by
this
time
,
inflame
his
thought
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
he
resolve
to
depart
for
London
,
with
all
possible
speed
;
and
for
that
purpose
industriously
employ
almost
every
hour
of
his
time
in
regulate
his
domestic
affair
.
    
<EOS>
He
pay
off
all
his
father
's
servant
,
and
hire
other
,
at
the
recommendation
of
his
sister
,
who
promise
to
superintend
his
houshold
in
his
absence
:
he
advance
the
first
half
-
yearly
payment
of
his
mother
's
jointure
;
and
as
for
his
brother
Gam
,
he
give
him
diver
opportunity
of
acknowledge
his
fault
,
so
as
that
he
may
have
answer
to
his
own
conscience
for
take
any
step
in
his
favour
;
but
that
young
gentleman
be
not
yet
sufficiently
humble
by
misfortune
,
and
not
only
forbore
to
make
any
overture
of
peace
,
but
also
take
all
occasion
to
slander
the
conduct
and
revile
the
person
of
our
hero
,
be
,
in
this
practice
,
comfort
and
abet
by
his
righteous
mamma
.
    
<EOS>
every
thing
be
thus
settle
for
the
present
,
the
triumvirate
set
out
on
their
return
to
town
,
in
the
same
manner
with
that
in
which
they
have
arrive
in
the
country
,
except
in
this
small
variation
,
that
Hatchway
's
chaise
-
companion
be
now
the
valet
de
chambre
refit
,
instead
of
Pipes
,
who
,
with
another
lacquey
,
attend
them
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
perform
two
third
of
their
way
to
London
,
they
chance
to
overtake
a
country
squire
,
on
his
return
from
a
visit
to
one
of
his
neighbour
,
who
have
entertain
him
with
such
hospitality
,
that
(
as
the
lieutenant
observe
)
<EOS>
he
roll
himself
almost
gun
wale
to
,
at
every
motion
of
his
horse
,
which
be
a
fine
hunter
;
and
when
the
chaise
pass'd
<EOS>
him
at
full
speed
,
he
set
up
the
sportsman
's
hollow
,
in
a
voice
that
sound
like
a
french
horn
,
clap
spur
to
Sorrel
at
the
same
time
,
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
pace
of
the
machine
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
be
animate
with
an
uncommon
flow
of
spirit
,
order
his
postilion
to
proceed
more
softly
;
and
enter
into
conversation
with
the
stranger
,
touch
the
make
and
mettle
of
his
horse
,
upon
which
he
descant
with
so
much
learning
,
that
the
squire
be
astonish
at
his
knowledge
,
and
so
engaged
with
his
manner
of
discourse
,
that
,
when
they
approach
his
habitation
,
he
invite
the
young
gentleman
and
his
company
to
halt
,
and
drink
a
bottle
of
his
ale
;
and
be
so
pressing
in
his
solicitation
,
that
they
comply
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
conduct
them
through
a
spacious
avenue
,
that
extend
as
far
as
the
highway
,
to
the
gate
of
a
large
chateau
,
of
a
most
noble
and
venerable
appearance
,
which
induce
them
to
alight
and
view
the
apartment
,
contrary
to
their
first
intention
of
drink
a
glass
of
his
October
at
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
the
room
be
every
way
suitable
to
the
magnificence
of
the
outside
,
and
our
hero
imagine
they
have
make
a
tour
through
the
whole
sweep
,
when
the
landlord
give
him
to
understand
that
they
have
not
yet
see
the
good

into

of
uncommon
astonishment

<EOS>
the

the

and
he

"
I
know
(

<EOS>
what
make
you

so
woefully
<EOS>

you

it
strange
to

my

boot
and

with
huge
three

tail
perriwig
on
their

<EOS>
the
truth
of

this
:
I
could
not
abide
to
zee
the
picture
of
my
vamily
,
with
a
parcel
of
loose
hair
hang
about
their
eye
,
like
zo
many

and
zo
I
employ
a
painter
vellow
from
Lundon
to
clap
decent
perriwig
upon
their
skull
,
at
the
rate
of
vive
shilling

him
three

after

haggle
with
me
for
your

and
zo
,
rather
than

upon

I
turn
him
off

and
shall
let

stand
as
they

He

<EOS>
Godfrey
,
who
have
take
leave
of
his
sister
,
on
pretence
of
make
a
short
excursion
with
Peregrine
,
whose
health
require
the
enjoyment
of
fresh
air
,
after
his
long
confinement
,
send
a
message
to
her
,
that
same
night
,
announce
his
arrival
,
and
give
her
notice
that
he
would
breakfast
with
her
next
morning
;
when
he
and
our
hero
,
who
have
dress
himself
for
the
purpose
,
take
a
hackney
-
coach
,
repair
to
her
lodging
,
and
be
introduce
into
a
parlour
,
adjoin
to
that
in
which
the
tea
-
table
be
set
.
<EOS>
here
they
have
not
wait
many
minute
when
they
hear
the
sound
of
foot
,
come
down
stair
;
upon
which
our
hero
's
heart
begin
to
beat
the
alarm
,
and
he
conceal
himself
behind
the
screen
,
by
the
direction
of
his
friend
,
whose
ear
be
salute
with
Sophy
's
voice
from
the
next
room
,
he
fly
into
it
with
great
ardour
,
and
enjoy
upon
her
lip
the
sweet
transport
of
a
meeting
so
unexpected
;
for
he
have
leave
her
in
her
father
's
house
at
Windsor
.
    
<EOS>
amidst
these
emotion
,
he
have
almost
forget
the
situation
of
Peregrine
;
when
Emilia
,
assume
an
enchanting
air
,
"
be
not
this
(
say
she
)
a
most
provoking
scene
to
a
young
woman
like
me
,
who
be
doom
to
wear
the
willow
,
by
the
strange
caprice
of
my
lover
?
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
brother
,
you
have
do
me
infinite
prejudice
,
in
promote
this
jaunt
with
my
obstinate
correspondent
;
who
,
I
suppose
,
be
so
ravished
with
this
transient
glimpse
of
liberty
.
<EOS>
that
he
will
never
be
persuade
to
incur
unnecessary
confinement
for
the
future
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sister
,
(
reply
the
captain
,
tauntingly
)
<EOS>
your
own
pride
set
him
the
example
;
so
you
must
<EOS>
e'en
stand
to
the
consequence
of
his
imitation
.
"
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
a
hard
case
,
however
,
(
answer
the
fair
offender
)
that
I
should
suffer
all
my
life
,
by
one
venial
trespass
.
<EOS>
Heigh
ho
!
<EOS>
who
would
imagine
that
a
sprightly
girl
,
such
as
I
,
with
ten
thousand
pound
,
should
go
a
begging
?
    
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
marry
the
next
person
that
ask
me
the
question
,
in
order
to
be
revenge
upon
this
unyielding
humourist
.
<EOS>
do
the
dear
fellow
discover
no
inclination
to
see
me
,
in
all
the
term
of
his
releasement
?
<EOS>
well
,
if
ever
I
can
catch
the
fugitive
again
,
he
shall
sing
in
his
cage
for
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
convey
to
the
reader
a
just
idea
of
Peregrine
's
transport
,
while
he
overhear
this
declaration
;
which
be
no
sooner
pronounce
,
than
,
unable
to
resist
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
he
spring
from
his
lurk
place
,
exclaim
,
"
here
I
surrender
;
"
and
rush
into
her
presence
,
be
so
dazzled
with
her
beauty
,
that
his
speech
fail
:
he
be
fix
,
like
a
statue
,
to
the
floor
;
and
all
his
faculty
be
absorpt
in
admiration
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
now
in
the
full
bloom
of
her
charm
,
and
it
be
nearly
impossible
to
look
upon
her
without
emotion
.
<EOS>
what
then
must
have
be
the
extasy
of
our
youth
,
whose
passion
be
whet
with
all
the
incitement
which
could
stimulate
the
human
heart
!
<EOS>
the
lady
scream
with
surprize
at
his
appearance
,
and
Emilia
undergo
such
agitation
as
flush
every
charm
with
irresistible
energy
:
her
cheek
glow
with
a
most
delicate
suffusion
,
and
her
bosom
heave
with
such
bewitching
undulation
,
that
the
cambrick
could
not
conceal
or
contain
the
snowy
hemisphere
,
that
rise
like
a
vision
of
paradise
to
his
view
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
be
almost
faint
with
unutterable
delight
,
she
seem
ready
to
sink
under
the
tumult
of
tenderness
and
confusion
;
when
our
hero
,
perceive
her
condition
,
obey
the
impulse
of
his
love
,
and
circle
the
charmer
in
his
arm
,
without
suffer
the
least
frown
or
symptom
of
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
not
all
the
pleasure
of
his
life
,
have
amount
to
the
ineffable
joy
of
this
embrace
,
in
which
he
continue
for
some
minute
totally
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
fasten
upon
her
pouting
lip
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
rapture
;
and
,
while
his
brain
seem
to
whirl
round
with
transport
,
exclaim
in
a
delirium
of
bliss
,
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
this
be
too
much
to
bear
!
"
    
<EOS>
His
imagination
be
accordingly
relieve
,
and
his
attention
in
some
measure
divide
,
by
the
interposition
of
Sophy
,
who
kindly
chide
him
for
his
have
overlook
his
old
friend
:
thus
accost
,
he
quit
his
delicious
armful
,
and
,
salute
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
ask
pardon
for
his
neglect
;
observe
,
that
such
rudeness
be
excuseable
,
consider
the
long
and
unhappy
exile
which
he
have
suffer
,
from
the
jewel
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Emilia
,
"
I
be
come
,
madam
,
(
say
he
)
to
claim
the
performance
of
your
promise

which
I
can
produce
under
your

fair
hand
:
you
may

therefore

lie
aside
all
superfluous
ceremony
and
shyness

and
crown
my
happiness
without
farther
delay

my
soul

<EOS>
my

be
wind
up
to
the
last
pitch
of
expectation

I
shall
certainly
run
distract
,
if
I
be
doom
to
any
term
of
probation
.
"
    
<EOS>
His
mistress
,
have
by
this
time
recollect
herself
,
reply
with
a
most
exhilerating
smile
,
"
I
ought
to
punish
you
,
for
your
obstinacy
,
with
the
mortification
of
a
twelve

month
's
trial
;
but
'
tis
dangerous
to
tamper
with
an
admirer
of
your
disposition

therefore
,
I
think
,
I
must
make
sure
of
you
while
it
be
in
my
power

"
<EOS>
"
You
be
willing

then
,
to
take
me
for
better
for
bad
,
in

these
witness
?
"
cry
Peregrine
,
kneel
,
and
apply
her
hand
to
his
lip
.
    
<EOS>
at
this
interrogation
,
her
feature
soften
into
an
amazing
expression
of
condescend
love
;
and
while
she
dart
a
side
-
glance
,
that
thrill
to
his
marrow
,
and
heave
a
sigh
more
soft
than
zephyr
's
balmy
wing

her
answer
be
,
"
why
 
ay
 
and
heaven
grant
me
patience
to
bear
the
humour
of
such
a
yokefellow
.

<EOS>
"
and
may
the

the
youth

grant
me
life

opportunity
to
manifest
the
immensity
of
my
love

I
have
eighty
thousand
pound

which
shall
be
lay
immediately
in
your
lap

"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
seal
the
contract
upon
her
lip
,
and
explain
the
mystery
of
his
last
word
,
which
have
begin
to
operate
upon
the
wonder
of
the
two
sister
.
<EOS>
Sophy
be
agreeably
surprised
with
the
account
of
his
good
fortune
:
nor
be
it
,
in
all
probability
,
unacceptable
to
the
lovely
Emilia
;
tho
'
,
from
this
information
,
she
take
an
opportunity
to
upbraid
her
admirer
with
the
inflexibility
of
his
pride

which
(
she
scruple
not
to
say
)
would
have
baffle
all
the
suggestion
of
his
passion
,
have
not
it
be
gratify
by
this
providential
event
.
    
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
happily
mature
,
the
lover
beg
that
immediate
recourse
may
be
have
to
the
church
,
and
his
happiness
ascertain
before
night

<EOS>
but
the
bride
object
,
with
great
vehemence
,
to
such
precipitation
,
be
desirous
of
her
mother
's
presence
at
the
ceremony
;
and
she
be
second
in
her
opinion
by
her
brother
's
wife
:
upon
which
Peregrine
,
madden
with
desire
,
assault
her
with
the
most
earnest
intreatie
,
represent
,
that
,
as
her
mother
's
consent
be
already
obtain
,
there
be
surely
no
necessity
for
a
delay
,
that
must
infallibly
make
a
dangerous
impression
upon
his
brain
and
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
He
fall
at
her
foot
,
in
all
the
agony
of
impatience
;
swear
that
his
life
and
intellect
would
actually
be
in
jeopardy
by
her
refusal
;
and
when
she
attempt
to
argue
him
out
of
his
demand
,
begin
to
rave
with
such
extravagance

that
Sophy
be
frighten
into
conviction

and
Godfrey
enforce
the
remonstrance
of
his
friend
,
the
amiable
Emilia
be
teize
into
compliance

<EOS>
after
breakfast
the
bridegroom
and
his
companion
set
out
for
the
Commons
for
a
licence
,
have
first
agree
upon
the
house
at
which
the
ceremony
should
be
perform
,
in
the
lodging
of
the
bride
:
and
the
permission
be
obtain

they
find
mean
to
engage
a
clergyman
,
who
undertake
to
attend
them
at
their
own
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
then
a
ring
be
purchase
for
the
occasion
;
and
they
go
in
search
of
the
lieutenant
,
with
whom
they
dine
at
a
tavern
,
and
not
only
make
him
acquaint
with
the
step
they
have
take
,
but
desire
that
he
would
stand
god
-
father
to
the
bride

an
employment
which
Jack
accept
with
demonstration
of
particular
satisfaction

chancing

look
into

street

approach
the
door

consequence
of
a
message
they
have
send
to
him
by
Pipes
,
he
decline
the
office
in
favour
of
the
senior
;
who
be
accordingly
ordain
for
that
purpose

on
the
supposition
that
such
a
mark
of
regard
may
facilitate
his
concurrence
with
a
match
,
which
,
otherwise

he
would
certainly
oppose

as
he
be
a
professed
enemy
to
wedlock
,
and
,
as
yet
,
ignorant
of
Peregrine
's
intention

<EOS>
after
have
congratulate
Pickle
upon
his
succession
,
and
shake
his
two
friend
by
the
hand
,
the
misanthrope
ask
whose
mare
be
dead

that
he
be
summon
in
such
a
plaguy
hurry
from
his
dinner
,
which
he
have
be
fain
to
gobble
up
like
a
cannibal

Our
hero
give
him
to
understand
,
that
they
have
make
an
appointment
to
drink
tea
with
two
agreeable
lady
,
and
be
unwilling

should
lose
the
opportunity
of
enjoy
an
entertainment
which

love
so
much

shrivel
up
his

autumn
leaf

at
this
intimation

curse
his
complaisance

and
swear
they
should
keep
their
assignation
without
him
;
for
he
and
letchery
have
shake
hand
many
year
ago
.
    
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
,
however
,
liken
him
unto
an
old
coachman
,
who
still
delight
in
the
smack
of
the
whip
,
and
drop
some
flattering
hint
of
his
manhood

at
these
year
,

gradually
prevail
upon
to
accompany
them
to
the
place
of

three
minute
when
they
be

by
the

have
observe
the
hour
with
great
punctuality

<EOS>
this
gentleman
no
sooner
enter
the
room
,
than
Cadwallader
,
in
a
whisper
to
Gauntlet
,
ask
if
that
be
not
the
cock

bawd
;
and
before
the
captain
could
make
any
reply
,
"
what
an
unconscionable
whore

master
the
rogue
be
!
<EOS>
(

he
)
scarce
discharge
from

and
sweeten
with
a
little
fresh
air
,
and
yet
be
wench
with
a
pimp
in
canonical
in
his
pay

"
<EOS>
the
door
again
open
,

Emilia
break
in
upon
them
,
with
such
dignity
of
mien
,
and
divinity
of
aspect
,
as
inspire
every
spectator
with
astonishment
and
admiration

<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
who
have
not
see
her
since
her
charm
be
ripen
into
such
perfection
,
express
his
wonder
and
approbation
in
an
exclamation
of
"
Add

zook
!
<EOS>
what
a
glorious
galley
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
misanthrope
's
visage
be
instantly
metamorphose
into
the
face
of
a
mountain

goat
;
he
lick
his
lip
instinctively
,
snuff
the

most
horrible
obliquity
of
vision

Hatchway
have
renew
his
acquaintance
with
the
former

into
another
apartment
with
his
friend
Crabtree
,
to
whom
he
impart
the
design
of
this
meeting
,
which
the
latter
no
sooner
understand
,
than
he
attempt
to
retreat
,
without
make
any
other
reply
than
that
of
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
rot
your
matrimony
!
<EOS>
can
not
you
put
your
neck
in
the
noose
,
without
my
be
a
witness
of
your
folly
?
"
    
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
in
order
to
vanquish
this
aversion
,
step
to
the
door
of
the
next
room
,
and
beg
the
favour
of
speak
with
Emilia
,
to
whom
he
introduce
the
testy
old
batchelor
,
as
one
of
his
particular
friend
,
who
desire
to
have
the
honour
of
give
her
away
.
<EOS>
the
bewitching
smile
with
which
she
receive
his
salute
,
and
grant
his
request
,
at
once
overcome
the
disapprobration
of
the
misanthrope
,
who
with
a
relaxation
in
his
countenance
which
have
never
be
perceive
before
that
instant
,
thank
her
in
the
most
polite
term
for
such
an
agreeable
mark
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
lead
her
into
the
dining
-
room
,
where
the
ceremony
be
perform
without
delay
;
and
after
the
husband
have
assert
his
prerogative
on
her
lip
,
the
whole
company
salute
her
by
the
name
of
Mrs
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
the
sensible
reader
to
judge
what
pass
at
this
juncture
,
within
the
bosom
of
the
new
-
married
couple
:
    
Peregrine
's
heart
be
fire
with
inexpressible
ardour
and
impatience
;
while
the
transport
of
the
bride
be
mingle
with
a
dash
of
diffidence
and
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
see
it
would
be
too
much
for
both
,
to
bear
their
present
tantalizing
situation
till
night
,
without
some
amusement
to
diverge
their
thought
;
and
therefore
propose
to
pass
part
of
the
evening
at
the
public
entertainment
in
Marybone
-
gardens
,
which
be
at
that
time
frequent
by
the
good
company
in
town
.
<EOS>
the
scheme
be
relish
by
the
discreet
Sophy
,
who
see
the
meaning
of
the
proposal
,
and
the
bride
submit
to
the
persuasion
of
her
sister
;
so
that
,
after
tea
,
two
coach
be
call
,
and
Peregrine
be
forcibly
separate
from
his
charmer
,
during
the
conveyance
.
    
<EOS>
while
they
stand
before
the
orchestra
,
listen
to
an
english
ballad
,
which
be
sing
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
,
our
hero
perceive
a
taudry
Frenchman
lean
against
a
post
,
and
entertain
himself
with
a
soliloquy
upon
the
barbarous
want
of
taste
in
England
,
so
conspicuous
in
the
applause
which
be
give
to
that
miserable
performance
;
and
as
his
remark
be
not
make
without
some
insolent
reflection
upon
the
nation
,
he
mark
him
as
a
proper
object
for
his
ridicule
,
and
begin
to
project
some
scheme
for
expose
him
to
the
mirth
of
the
company
,
because
he
look
upon
him
as
some
pert
valet
de
chambre
,
who
assume
the
character
of
a
gentleman
,
by
the
night
;
when
he
be
save
the
trouble
of
invent
by
an
accident
which
the
foreigner
of
himself
incur
.
    
<EOS>
one
of
the
waiter
belong
to
the
place
,
have
mark
with
chalk
the
score
of
a
company
whom
he
attend
,
on
the
very
post
which
the
Frenchman
have
think
proper
to
occupy
:
so
that
,
when
he
walk
away
,
he
carry
off
the
great
part
of
the
reckoning
upon
his
bag
and
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
servant
come
to
add
another
bottle
to
the
account
,
perceive
almost
the
whole
particular
of
the
bill
efface
,
and
begin
to
raise
an
hideous
outcry
against
the
people
that
stand
near
him
:
upon
which
our
hero
tell
him
how
the
misfortune
have
happen
,
and
point
out
the
person
who
bear
the
impression
upon
his
back
.
<EOS>
this
intelligence
be
no
sooner
communicate
,
than
the
waiter
,
call
some
of
his
brother
to
his
assistance
,
go
in
pursuit
of
the
delinquent
(
while
Pickle
desire
his
company
to
take
notice
)
and
tell
him
,
that
he
have
carry
off
part
of
a
reckoning
,
desire
he
would
return
,
that
they
may
compare
the
mark
upon
his
bag
with
the
fragment
which
remain
upon
the
post
.
    
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
,
who
do
not
understand
one
word
of
the
english
language
,
see
himself
accost
in
a
very
petulant
manner
by
this
attendant
,
at
first
imagine
that
he
and
his
companion
come
with
a
design
to
affront
him
,
because
he
be
a
foreigner
;
and
therefore
think
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
support
the
dignity
of
his
nation
,
begin
to
talk
very
big
in
his
native
tongue
,
and
,
in
order
to
inforce
his
word
,
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
in
a
very
menacing
posture
:
upon
which
the
confederate
fly
upon
him
,
and
secure
both
his
arm
,
lead
him
backward
through
a
lane
of
people
,
who
laugh
heartily
at
his
captivity
,
which
he
now
believe
to
be
the
effect
of
an
information
lay
against
him
,
for
some
trespass
upon
our
law
,
and
,
with
a
most
ludicrous
expression
of
fear
,
protest
,
that
he
be
utterly
ignorant
and
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
be
apprehend
.
    
<EOS>
be
conduct
to
the
spot
,
his
back
be
apply
to
the
post
,
and
the
separate
part
of
the
score
match
like
two
exchequer
tally
;
by
which
mean
they
be
able
to
ascertain
the
reckoning
,
and
then
dismiss'd
the
counterpart
,
who
have
stand
under
their
hand
,
with
a
most
rueful
face
of
expectation
,
and
afford
merriment
to
a
whole
crowd
of
spectator
,
a
great
part
of
whom
give
him
a
convoy
to
the
gate
,
by
which
he
make
his
retreat
with
great
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
the
new
-
married
couple
and
their
company
have
make
shift
to
spend
the
evening
,
and
sup
on
a
slight
collation
in
one
of
the
box
,
Peregrine
's
patience
be
almost
quite
exhausted
;
and
take
Godfrey
aside
,
he
impart
his
intention
to
withdraw
in
private
from
the
sea
-
wit
of
his
friend
Hatchway
,
who
would
,
otherwise
,
retard
his
bliss
,
with
unseasonable
impediment
,
which
,
at
present
,
he
could
not
possibly
bear
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
sympathize
with
his
impatience
,
undertake
to
intoxicate
the
lieutenant
with
bumper
to
the
joy
of
the
bride
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
desire
Sophy
to
retire
with
his
sister
,
under
the
auspex
of
Cadwallader
,
who
promise
to
squire
them
home
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
be
accordingly
conduct
to
the
coach
,
and
Jack
propose
to
the
captain
,
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
joke
,
the
bridegroom
should
be
ply
with
liquor
,
in
such
a
manner
as
would
effectually
disable
him
from
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
good
fortune
for
one
night
at
least
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
seem
to
relish
the
scheme
,
and
they
prevail
upon
Pickle
to
accompany
them
to
a
certain
tavern
,
on
pretence
of
drink
a
farewel
glass
to
a
single
life
;
there
the
bottle
be
circulate
,
till
Hatchway
's
brain
begin
to
suffer
innovation
,
and
as
he
have
secure
our
hero
's
hat
and
sword
,
he
feel
no
apprehension
of
an
elopement
,
which
,
however
,
be
effect
;
and
the
youth
hasten
on
the
wing
of
love
to
the
arm
of
his
enchanting
bride
.
<EOS>
He
find
Crabtree
in
a
parlour
,
wait
for
his
return
,
and
dispose
to
entertain
him
with
a
lecture
upon
temperance
;
to
which
he
pay
very
little
attention
,
but
ring
for
Emilia

maid
,
desire
to

if
her
mistress

<EOS>
be

to
announce
his

himself
to

and
slipper

and

the
misanthrope

night
,
after

desire
to
see
him
next
day
,
follow
in
person
to
the
delicious
scene
,
where
he
find
her
elegantly
dish

,
the
fair
daughter
of
chastity
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
approach
,
she
be
overwhelmed
with
confusion
,
and
hide
her
lovely
face
from
his
transported
view
;
while
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
see
his
eye
kindle
at
the
occasion
,
kiss
her
charming
sister
,
who
,
throw
her
snowy
arm
about
her
neck
,
would
have
detain
her
in
the
room
,
have
not
Peregrine
gently
disengage
her
confidante
from
her
embrace
,
and
conduct
her
tremble
to
the
door
;
which
have
bolt
and
barricado

he
profit
by
his
good
fortune
,
and
his
felicity

which
he
would

with
Sophy

like
Aurora
or

old
Crabtree

so
well
satisfied
with
his

,
as
to
be
almost
