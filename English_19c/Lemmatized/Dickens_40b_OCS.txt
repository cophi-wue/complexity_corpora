Night
be
generally
my
time
for
walk
.
<EOS>
in
the
summer
I
often
leave
home
early
in
the
morning
,
and
roam
about
field
and
lane
all
day
,
or
even
escape
for
day
or
week
together
;
but
,
save
in
the
country
,
I
seldom
go
out
until
after
dark
,
though
,
Heaven
be
thank
,
I
love
its
light
and
feel
the
cheerfulness
it
shed
upon
the
earth
,
as
much
as
any
creature
live
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
fall
insensibly
into
this
habit
,
both
because
it
favour
my
infirmity
and
because
it
afford
me
great
opportunity
of
speculate
on
the
character
and
occupation
of
those
who
fill
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
glare
and
hurry
of
broad
noon
be
not
adapt
to
idle
pursuit
like
mine
;
a
glimpse
of
pass
face
catch
by
the
light
of
a
street
-
lamp
or
a
shop
window
be
often
well
for
my
purpose
than
their
full
revelation
in
the
daylight
;
and
,
if
I
must
add
the
truth
,
night
be
kind
in
this
respect
than
day
,
which
too
often
destroy
an
air
-
build
castle
at
the
moment
of
its
completion
,
without
the
least
ceremony
or
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
that
constant
pacing
to
and
fro
,
that
never
-
end
restlessness
,
that
incessant
tread
of
foot
wear
the
rough
stone
smooth
and
glossy
---
be
it
not
a
wonder
how
the
dweller
in
narrows
way
can
bear
to
hear
it
!
<EOS>
think
of
a
sick
man
in
such
a
place
as
Saint
Martin
's
Court
,
listen
to
the
footstep
,
and
in
the
midst
of
pain
and
weariness
oblige
,
despite
himself
(
as
though
it
be
a
task
he
must
perform
)
to
detect
the
child
's
step
from
the
man
's
,
the
slipshod
beggar
from
the
boot
exquisite
,
<EOS>
the
lounge
from
the
busy
,
the
dull
heel
of
the
sauntering
outcast
from
the
quick
tread
of
an
expectant
pleasure
-
seeker
---
think
of
the
hum
and
noise
always
be
present
to
his
sense
,
and
of
the
stream
of
life
that
will
not
stop
,
pour
on
,
on
,
on
,
through
all
his
restless
dream
,
as
if
he
be
condemn
to
lie
,
dead
but
conscious
,
in
a
noisy
churchyard
,
and
have
no
hope
of
rest
for
century
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
the
crowd
for
ever
pass
and
repasse
on
the
bridge
(
on
those
which
be
free
of
toil
at
last
)
,
where
many
stop
on
fine
evening
look
listlessly
down
upon
the
water
with
some
vague
idea
that
by
and
by
it
run
between
green
bank
which
grow
wide
and
wide
until
at
last
it
join
the
broad
vast
sea
---
where
some
halt
to
rest
from
heavy
load
and
think
as
they
look
over
the
parapet
that
to
smoke
and
lounge
away
one
's
life
,
and
lie
sleep
in
the
sun
upon
a
hot
tarpaulin
,
in
a
dull
,
slow
,
sluggish
barge
,
must
be
happiness
unalloyed
---
and
where
some
,
and
a
very
different
class
,
pause
with
heaver
load
than
they
,
remember
to
have
hear
or
read
in
old
time
that
drown
be
not
a
hard
death
,
but
of
all
mean
of
suicide
the
easy
and
good
.

Covent
Garden
Market
at
sunrise
too
,
in
the
spring
or
summer
,
when
the
fragrance
of
sweet
flower
be
in
the
air
,
over
-
power
even
the
unwholesome
stream
of
last
night
's
debauchery
,
and
drive
the
dusky
thrust
,
whose
cage
have
hang
outside
a
garret
window
all
night
long
,
half
mad
with
joy
!
<EOS>
poor
bird
!
<EOS>
the
only
neighbouring
thing
at
all
akin
to
the
other
little
captive
,
some
of
whom
,
shrink
from
the
hot
hand
of
drunken
purchaser
,
lie
droop
on
the
path
already
,
while
other
,
soddene
by
close
contact
,
await
the
time
when
they
shall
be
water
and
freshen
up
to
please
more
sober
company
,
and
make
old
clerk
who
pass
them
on
their
road
to
business
,
wonder
what
have
fill
their
breast
with
vision
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
present
purpose
be
not
to
expatiate
upon
my
walk
.
<EOS>
the
story
I
be
about
to
relate
,
and
to
which
I
shall
recur
at
interval
,
 
arise
out
of
one
of
these
ramble
;
and
thus
I
have
be
lead
to
speak
of
them
by
way
of
preface
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
I
have
roam
into
the
City
,
and
be
walk
slowly
on
in
my
usual
way
,
muse
upon
a
great
many
thing
,
when
I
be
arrest
by
an
inquiry
,
the
purport
of
which
do
not
reach
me
,
but
which
seem
to
be
address
to
myself
,
and
be
prefer
in
a
soft
sweet
voice
that
strike
me
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
I
turn
hastily
round
and
find
at
my
elbow
a
pretty
little
girl
,
who
beg
to
be
direct
to
a
certain
street
at
a
considerable
distance
,
and
indeed
in
quite
another
quarter
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
long
way
from
here
,
"
say
I
,
"
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
sir
,
"
she
reply
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
a
very
long
way
,
for
I
come
from
there
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
alone
?
"
say
I
,
in
some
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
do
not
mind
that
,
but
I
be
a
little
frightened
now
,
for
I
have
lose
my
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
make
you
ask
it
of
me
?
<EOS>
suppose
I
should
tell
you
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
will
not
do
that
,
"
say
the
little
creature
,
"
you
be
such
a
very
old
gentleman
,
and
walk
so
slow
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
describe
how
much
I
be
impressed
by
this
appeal
and
the
energy
with
which
it
be
make
,
which
bring
a
tear
into
the
child
's
clear
eye
,
and
make
her
slight
figure
tremble
as
she
look
up
into
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
will
take
you
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
mind
as
confidingly
as
if
she
have
know
me
from
her
cradle
,
and
we
trudge
away
together
;
the
little
creature
accommodate
her
pace
to
mine
,
and
rather
seem
to
lead
and
take
care
of
me
than
I
to
be
protect
her
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
steal
a
curious
look
at
my
face
,
as
if
to
make
quite
sure
that
I
be
not
deceive
her
,
and
that
these
glance
(
very
sharp
and
keen
<EOS>
they
be
too
)
seem
to
increase
her
confidence
at
every
repetition
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
my
curiosity
and
interest
be
at
least
equal
to
the
child
's
,
for
child
she
certainly
be
,
although
I
think
it
probably
from
what
I
could
make
out
,
that
her
very
small
and
delicate
frame
impart
a
peculiar
youthfulness
to
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
though
more
scantily
attire
than
she
may
have
be
she
be
dress
with
perfect
neatness
,
and
betray
no
mark
of
poverty
or
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
have
send
you
so
far
by
yourself
?
"
say
I.
  
"
someone
who
be
very
kind
to
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
have
you
be
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
I
must
not
tell
,
"
say
the
child
firmly
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
manner
of
this
reply
which
cause
me
to
look
at
the
little
creature
with
an
involuntary
expression
of
surprise
;
for
I
wonder
what
kind
of
errand
it
may
be
that
occasion
her
to
be
prepare
for
question
.
<EOS>
Her
quick
eye
seem
to
read
my
thought
,
for
as
it
meet
mine
<EOS>
she
add
that
there
be
no
harm
in
what
she
have
be
do
,
but
it
be
a
great
secret
---
a
secret
which
she
do
not
even
know
herself
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
say
with
no
appearance
of
cunning
or
deceit
,
but
with
an
unsuspicious
frankness
that
bear
the
impress
of
truth
.
<EOS>
She
walk
on
as
before
,
grow
more
familiar
with
me
as
we
proceed
and
talk
cheerfully
by
the
way
,
but
she
say
no
more
about
her
home
,
beyond
remark
that
we
be
go
quite
a
new
road
and
ask
if
it
be
a
short
one
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
thus
engage
,
I
revolve
in
my
mind
a
hundred
different
explanation
of
the
riddle
and
reject
them
every
one
.
<EOS>
I
really
feel
ashamed
to
take
advantage
of
the
ingenuousness
or
grateful
feeling
of
the
child
for
the
purpose
of
gratify
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
love
these
little
people
;
and
it
be
not
a
slight
thing
when
they
,
who
be
so
fresh
from
God
,
love
us
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
feel
pleased
at
first
by
her
confidence
I
determine
to
deserve
it
,
and
to
do
credit
to
the
nature
which
have
prompt
her
to
repose
it
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
,
however
,
why
I
should
refrain
from
see
the
person
who
have
inconsiderately
send
her
to
so
great
a
distance
by
night
and
alone
,
and
as
it
be
not
improbable
that
if
she
find
herself
near
home
she
may
take
farewell
of
me
and
deprive
me
of
the
opportunity
,
I
avoid
the
most
frequented
way
and
take
the
most
intricate
,
and
thus
it
be
not
until
we
arrive
in
the
street
itself
that
she
know
where
we
be
.
<EOS>
clap
her
hand
with
pleasure
and
run
on
before
me
for
a
short
distance
,
my
little
acquaintance
stop
at
a
door
and
remain
on
the
step
till
I
come
up
knock
at
it
when
I
join
her
.
  
<EOS>
a
part
of
this
door
be
of
glass
unprotecte
by
any
shutter
,
which
I
do
not
observe
at
first
,
for
all
be
very
dark
and
silent
within
,
and
I
be
anxious
(
as
indeed
the
child
be
also
)
for
an
answer
to
our
summon
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
knock
twice
or
thrice
there
be
a
noise
as
if
some
person
be
move
inside
,
and
at
length
a
faint
light
appear
through
the
glass
which
,
as
it
approach
very
slowly
,
the
bearer
have
to
make
his
way
through
a
great
many
scatter
article
,
enable
me
to
see
both
what
kind
of
person
it
be
who
advanced
and
what
kind
of
place
it
be
through
which
he
come
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
man
with
long
grey
hair
,
whose
face
and
figure
as
he
hold
the
light
above
his
head
and
look
before
him
as
he
approach
,
I
could
plainly
see
.
<EOS>
though
much
alter
by
age
,
I
fancy
I
could
recognize
in
his
spare
and
slender
form
something
of
that
delicate
mould
which
I
have
notice
in
a
child
.
<EOS>
Their
bright
blue
eye
be
certainly
alike
,
but
his
face
be
so
deeply
furrowed
and
so
very
full
of
care
,
that
here
all
resemblance
cease
.
  
<EOS>
the
place
through
which
he
make
his
way
at
leisure
be
one
of
those
receptacle
for
old
and
curious
thing
which
seem
to
crouch
in
odd
corner
of
this
town
and
to
hide
their
musty
treasure
from
the
public
eye
in
jealousy
and
distrust
.
<EOS>
there
be
suit
of
mail
stand
like
ghost
in
armour
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
fantastic
carving
bring
from
monkish
cloister
,
rusty
weapon
of
various
kind
,
distort
figure
in
china
and
wood
and
iron
and
ivory
:
tapestry
and
strange
furniture
that
may
have
be
design
in
dream
.
<EOS>
the
haggard
aspect
of
the
little
old
man
be
wonderfully
suited
to
the
place
;
he
may
have
grope
among
old
church
and
tomb
and
deserted
house
and
gather
all
the
spoil
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
whole
collection
but
be
in
keep
with
himself
nothing
that
look
old
or
more
worn
than
he
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
,
he
survey
me
with
some
astonishment
which
be
not
diminish
when
he
look
from
me
to
my
companion
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
,
the
child
address
him
as
grandfather
,
and
tell
him
the
little
story
of
our
companionship
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
bless
thee
,
child
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
pat
her
on
the
head
,
"
how
couldst
thou
miss
thy
way
?
<EOS>
what
if
I
have
lose
thee
,
Nell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
find
my
way
back
to
you
,
grandfather
,
"
say
the
child
boldly
;
"
never
fear
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
kiss
her
,
then
turn
to
me
and
beg
me
to
walk
in
,
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
close
and
lock
.
<EOS>
precede
me
with
the
light
,
he
lead
me
through
the
place
I
have
already
see
from
without
,
into
a
small
sit
-
room
behind
,
in
which
be
another
door
open
into
a
kind
of
closet
,
where
I
see
a
little
bed
that
a
fairy
may
have
sleep
in
,
it
look
so
very
small
and
be
so
prettily
arrange
.
<EOS>
the
child
take
a
candle
and
trip
into
this
little
room
,
leave
the
old
man
and
me
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
tired
,
sir
,
"
say
he
as
he
place
a
chair
near
the
fire
,
"
how
can
I
thank
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
take
more
care
of
your
grandchild
another
time
,
my
good
friend
,
"
I
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
care
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
old
man
in
a
shrill
voice
,
"
more
care
of
Nelly
!
<EOS>
why
,
who
ever
love
a
child
as
I
love
Nell
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
this
with
such
evident
surprise
that
I
be
perplex
what
answer
to
make
,
and
the
more
so
because
couple
with
something
feeble
and
wander
in
his
manner
,
there
be
in
his
face
mark
of
deep
and
anxious
thought
which
convince
me
that
he
could
not
be
,
as
I
have
be
at
first
incline
to
suppose
,
in
a
state
of
dotage
or
imbecility
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
consider
---
"
I
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
consider
!
"
cry
the
old
man
interrupt
me
,
"
I
do
not
consider
her
!
<EOS>
ah
,
how
little
you
know
of
the
truth
!
<EOS>
little
nelly
,
little
nelly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
for
any
man
,
I
care
not
what
his
form
of
speech
may
be
,
to
express
more
affection
than
the
dealer
in
curiosity
do
,
in
these
four
word
.
<EOS>
I
wait
for
him
to
speak
again
,
but
he
rest
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
shake
his
head
twice
or
thrice
fix
his
eye
upon
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
sit
thus
in
silence
,
the
door
of
the
closet
open
,
and
the
child
return
,
her
light
brown
hair
hang
loose
about
her
neck
,
and
her
face
flush
with
the
haste
she
have
make
to
rejoin
us
.
<EOS>
She
busy
herself
immediately
in
prepare
supper
,
and
while
she
be
thus
engage
I
remark
that
the
old
man
take
an
opportunity
of
observe
me
more
closely
than
he
have
do
yet
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
see
that
all
this
time
everything
be
do
by
the
child
,
and
that
there
appear
to
be
no
other
person
but
ourselves
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
take
advantage
of
a
moment
when
she
be
absent
to
venture
a
hint
on
this
point
,
to
which
the
old
man
reply
that
there
be
few
grown
person
as
trustworthy
or
as
careful
as
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
always
grieve
me
,
"
I
observe
,
rouse
by
what
I
take
to
be
his
selfishness
,
"
it
always
grieve
me
to
contemplate
the
initiation
of
child
into
the
way
of
life
,
when
they
be
scarcely
more
than
infant
.
<EOS>
It
check
their
confidence
and
simplicity
---
two
of
the
good
quality
that
Heaven
give
them
---
and
demand
that
they
share
our
sorrow
before
they
be
capable
of
enter
into
our
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
never
check
her
,
"
say
the
old
man
look
steadily
at
me
,
"
the
spring
be
too
deep
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
child
of
the
poor
know
but
few
pleasure
.
<EOS>
even
the
cheap
delight
of
childhood
must
be
buy
and
pay
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
---
forgive
me
for
say
this
---
you
be
surely
not
so
very
poor
"
---
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
my
child
,
sir
,
"
return
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
,
and
she
be
poor
.
<EOS>
I
save
nothing
---
not
a
penny
---
though
I
live
as
you
see
,
but
"
---
he
lay
his
hand
upon
my
arm
and
leant
forward
to
whisper
---
<EOS>
"
she
shall
be
rich
one
of
these
day
,
and
a
fine
lady
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
ill
of
me
because
I
use
her
help
.
<EOS>
She
give
it
cheerfully
as
you
see
,
and
it
would
break
her
heart
if
she
know
that
I
suffer
anybody
else
to
do
for
me
what
her
little
hand
could
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
consider
!
"
---
he
cry
with
sudden
querulousness
,
"
<EOS>
why
,
God
know
that
this
one
child
be
there
think
and
object
of
my
life
,
and
yet
he
never
prosper
me
---
no
,
never
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
the
subject
of
our
conversation
again
return
,
and
the
old
man
motion
to
me
to
approach
the
table
,
break
off
,
and
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
scarcely
begin
our
repast
when
there
be
a
knock
at
the
door
by
which
I
have
enter
,
and
Nell
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
,
which
I
be
rejoice
to
hear
,
for
it
be
childlike
and
full
of
hilarity
,
say
it
be
no
doubt
dear
old
kit
come
back
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Foolish
Nell
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
old
man
fondle
with
her
hair
.
<EOS>
"
She
always
laugh
at
poor
kit
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
laugh
again
more
heartily
than
before
,
I
could
not
help
smile
from
pure
sympathy
.
<EOS>
the
little
old
man
take
up
a
candle
and
go
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
back
,
Kit
be
at
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
kit
be
a
shock
-
head
,
shambling
,
awkward
lad
with
an
uncommonly
wide
mouth
,
very
red
cheek
,
a
turn
-
up
nose
,
and
certainly
the
most
comical
expression
of
face
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
He
stop
short
at
the
door
on
see
a
stranger
,
twirl
in
his
hand
a
perfectly
round
old
hat
without
any
vestige
of
a
brim
,
and
rest
himself
now
on
one
leg
and
now
on
the
other
and
change
them
constantly
,
stand
in
the
doorway
,
look
into
the
parlour
with
the
most
extraordinary
leer
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
I
entertain
a
grateful
feeling
towards
the
boy
from
that
minute
,
for
I
feel
that
he
be
the
comedy
of
the
child
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
long
way
,
be
not
it
,
kit
?
"
say
the
little
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
it
be
a
goodish
stretch
,
master
,
"
return
kit
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
have
come
back
hungry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
I
do
consider
myself
rather
so
,
master
,
"
be
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
the
lad
have
a
remarkable
manner
of
standing
sideways
as
he
speak
,
and
thrust
his
head
forward
over
his
shoulder
,
as
if
he
could
not
get
at
his
voice
without
that
accompany
action
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
have
amuse
one
anywhere
,
but
the
child
's
exquisite
enjoyment
of
his
oddity
,
and
the
relief
it
be
to
find
that
there
be
something
she
associate
with
merriment
in
a
place
that
appear
so
unsuited
to
her
,
be
quite
irresistible
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
point
too
that
kit
himself
be
flatter
by
the
sensation
he
create
,
and
after
several
effort
to
preserve
his
gravity
,
burst
into
a
loud
roar
,
and
so
stand
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eye
nearly
shut
,
laugh
violently
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
have
again
relapse
into
his
former
abstraction
and
take
no
notice
of
what
pass
,
but
I
remark
that
when
her
laugh
be
over
,
the
child
's
bright
eye
be
dim
with
tear
,
call
forth
by
the
fullness
of
heart
with
which
she
welcome
her
uncouth
favourite
after
the
little
anxiety
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
as
for
kit
himself
(
whose
laugh
have
be
all
the
time
one
of
that
sort
which
very
little
would
change
into
a
cry
)
<EOS>
he
carry
a
large
slice
of
bread
and
meat
and
a
mug
of
beer
into
a
corner
,
and
apply
himself
to
dispose
of
them
with
great
voracity
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
old
man
turn
to
me
with
a
sigh
,
as
if
I
have
speak
to
him
but
that
moment
,
"
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
when
you
tell
me
that
I
do
not
consider
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
attach
too
great
weight
to
a
remark
found
on
first
appearance
,
my
friend
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
return
the
old
man
thoughtfully
,
"
no

<EOS>
come
hither
,
Nell

"
  
<EOS>
the
little
girl
hasten
from
her
seat
,
and
put
her
arm
about
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"

he
.
<EOS>
"
say
---

no

"
  
<EOS>
the
child
only
answer
by
her
caress
,
and
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
dost
thou
sob
?
"
say
the
grandfather
,
press
her
closer
to
him
and
glance
towards
me
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
because
thou
know'st
I

dost
not

my
question

"

with

earnestness

who
in
despatch
his
bread
and
meat
have
be
swallow
two
-
third
of
his
knife
at

mouthful
with
the
coolness
of

thus
appeal

and
bawl
"

after
which
he
incapacitate
himself
for

conversation
by
take
a
most
prodigious
sandwich
at
one
bite

<EOS>
"
She

the

the

I
say
again
that

long
time

it
must
come
at

a
very
long
time

it
surely
must

It
have
come
to

I
be

then
he
mutter
again
between
his

It
will
be

and
then
he
sigh
and
fall
into

former
musing

still
hold
the

to
be
insensible

by

once

Kit
gradually
back

free

may
I
ask

a
question

ay

what
be

this
delicate

with
so
much
beauty

nobody

anxiously

"
no

no

be
you
not
fearful

I

"
that
you
may
misunderstand
a
charge
so
tender

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
mean
well
,
but
be
you
quite
certain
that
you
know
how
to
execute
such
a
trust
as
this
?
<EOS>
I
be
an
old
man

like
you

I
be
actuate
by
an
old
man
's
concern
in
all
that
be
young

promising

<EOS>
do
you
not
think
that
what
I
have
see
of
you
and
this
little
creature
to

night
must
have
an
interest
not
wholly
free
from
pain
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
rejoin
the
old
man
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
feel
hurt
at
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
in
many
respect
I
be
the
child
,
and
she
the
grown
person
---
that
you
have
see
already

<EOS>
but
wake

sleep
,
by
night
or
day
,
in
sickness
or
health
,
she
be
the
one
object
of
my
care

and
if
you
know
of
how
much
care
,
you
would
look
on
me
with
different
eye
,
you
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
weary
life
for
an
old
man

a
weary
,
weary
life

there
be
a
great
end
to
gain

that
I
keep
before
me

<EOS>
see
that
he
be
in
a
state
of
excitement

impatience

I
turn
to
put
on
an
outer
coat

I
have
throw
off
on
enter
the
room

purpose
to
say
no
more

<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
see
the
child
stand
patiently
by
with
a
cloak
upon
her
arm

in
her
hand
a
hat
,

stick

I
look
in
astonishment
towards
the
old

he
be
,

feign
to
be

busy
in
the
arrangement

his
dress

from
him
I
look
back
to
the
slight
gentle
figure
of
the
child
.
<EOS>
alone
!
<EOS>
in
that
gloomy
place
all
the
long
,
dreary
night
.
  
<EOS>
She
evince
no
consciousness
of
my
surprise
,
but
cheerfully
help
the
old
man
with
his
cloak
,
and
when
he
be
ready
take
a
candle
to
light
us
out
.
<EOS>
find
that
we
do
not
follow
as
she
expect
,
she
look
back
with
a
smile
and
wait
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
show
by
his
face
that
he
plainly
understand
the
cause
of
my
hesitation
,
but
he
merely
sign
to
me
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
to
pass
out
of
the
room
before
him
,
and
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
resource
but
to
comply
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
reach
the
door
,
the
child
set
down
the
candle
,
turn
to
say
good
night
and
raise
her
face
to
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
then
she
run
to
the
old
man
,
who
fold
her
in
his
arm
and
bade
God
bless
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
sleep
soundly
,
Nell
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
and
angel
guard
thy
bed
!
<EOS>
do
not
forget
thy
prayer
,
my
sweet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
answer
the
child
fervently
,
"
they
make
me
feel
so
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
well
;
I
know
they
do
;
they
should
,
"
say
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
bless
thee
a
hundred
time
!
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
I
shall
be
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
ring
twice
,
"
return
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bell
wake
me
,
even
in
the
middle
of
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
,
they
separate
.
<EOS>
the
child
open
the
door
(
now
guard
by
a
shutter
which
I
have
hear
the
boy
put
up
before
he
leave
the
house
)
and
with
another
farewell
whose
clear
and
tender
note
I
have
recall
a
thousand
time
,
hold
it
until
we
have
pass
out
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
pause
a
moment
while
it
be
gently
close
and
fasten
on
the
inside
,
and
satisfy
that
this
be
do
,
walk
on
at
a
slow
pace
.
<EOS>
at
the
street
-
corner
he
stop
,
and
regard
me
with
a
troubled
countenance
say
that
our
way
be
widely
different
and
that
he
must
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
speak
,
but
summon
up
more
alacrity
than
may
have
be
expect
in
one
of
his
appearance
,
he
hurry
away
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
twice
or
thrice
he
look
back
as
if
to
ascertain
if
I
be
still
watch
him
,
or
perhaps
to
assure
himself
that
I
be
not
follow
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
the
obscurity
of
the
night
favour
his
disappearance
,
and
his
figure
be
soon
beyond
my
sight
.
  
<EOS>
I
remain
stand
on
the
spot
where
he
have
leave
me
,
unwilling
to
depart
,
and
yet
unknowing
why
I
should
loiter
there
.
<EOS>
I
look
wistfully
into
the
street
we
have
lately
quit
,
and
after
a
time
direct
my
step
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
pass
and
repasse
the
house
,
and
stop
and
listen
at
the
door
;
all
be
dark
,
and
silent
as
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
yet
I
linger
about
,
and
could
not
tear
myself
away
,
think
of
all
possible
harm
that
may
happen
to
the
child
---
of
fire
and
robbery
and
even
murder
---
and
feel
as
if
some
evil
must
ensure
if
I
turn
my
back
upon
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
closing
of
a
door
or
window
in
the
street
bring
me
before
the
curiosity
-
dealer
's
once
more
;
I
cross
the
road
and
look
up
at
the
house
to
assure
myself
that
the
noise
have
not
come
from
there
.
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
black
,
cold
,
and
lifeless
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
few
passenger
astir
;
the
street
be
sad
and
dismal
,
and
pretty
well
my
own
.
<EOS>
a
few
straggler
from
the
theatre
hurry
by
,
and
now
and
then
I
turn
aside
to
avoid
some
noisy
drunkard
as
he
reel
homeward
,
but
these
interruption
be
not
frequent
and
soon
cease
.
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
one
.
<EOS>
still
I
pace
up
and
down
,
promise
myself
that
every
time
should
be
the
last
,
and
break
faith
with
myself
on
some
new
plea
as
often
as
I
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
of
what
the
old
man
have
say
,
and
of
his
look
and
bear
,
the
less
I
could
account
for
what
I
have
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
misgiving
that
his
nightly
absence
be
for
no
good
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
come
to
know
the
fact
through
the
innocence
of
the
child
,
and
though
the
old
man
be
by
at
the
time
,
and
see
my
undisguised
surprise
,
he
have
preserve
a
strange
mystery
upon
the
subject
and
offer
no
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
these
reflection
naturally
recall
again
more
strongly
than
before
his
haggard
face
,
his
wander
manner
,
his
restless
anxious
look
.
<EOS>
His
affection
for
the
child
may
not
be
inconsistent
with
villany
of
the
bad
kind
;
even
that
very
affection
be
in
itself
an
extraordinary
contradiction
,
or
how
could
he
leave
her
thus
?
<EOS>
dispose
as
I
be
to
think
badly
of
him
,
I
never
doubt
that
his
love
for
her
be
real
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
admit
the
thought
,
remember
what
have
pass
between
us
,
and
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
have
call
her
by
her
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
stay
here
of
course
,
"
the
child
have
say
in
answer
to
my
question
,
"
I
always
do
!
<EOS>
"
what
could
take
him
from
home
by
night
,
and
every
night
!
<EOS>
I
call
up
all
the
strange
tale
I
have
ever
hear
of
dark
and
secret
deed
commit
in
great
town
and
escape
detection
for
a
long
series
of
year
;
wild
as
many
of
these
story
be
,
I
could
not
find
one
adapt
to
this
mystery
,
which
only
become
the
more
impenetrable
,
in
proportion
as
I
seek
to
solve
it
.
  
<EOS>
occupy
with
such
thought
as
these
,
and
a
crowd
of
other
all
tend
to
the
same
point
,
I
continue
to
pace
the
street
for
two
long
hour
;
at
length
the
rain
begin
to
descend
heavily
,
and
then
over
-
power
by
fatigue
though
no
less
interested
than
I
have
be
at
first
,
I
engage
the
near
coach
and
so
get
home
.
<EOS>
a
cheerful
fire
be
blaze
on
the
hearth
,
the
lamp
burn
brightly
,
my
clock
receive
me
with
its
old
familiar
welcome
;
everything
be
quiet
,
warm
and
cheer
,
and
in
happy
contrast
to
the
gloom
and
darkness
I
have
quit
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
that
night
,
wake
or
in
my
sleep
,
the
same
thought
recur
and
the
same
image
retain
possession
of
my
brain
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
before
me
the
old
dark
murky
room
---
the
gaunt
suit
of
mail
with
their
ghostly
silent
air
---
<EOS>
the
face
all
awry
,
grin
from
wood
and
stone
---
the
dust
and
rust
and
worm
that
live
in
wood
---
and
alone
in
the
midst
of
all
this
lumber
and
decay
and
ugly
age
,
the
beautiful
child
in
her
gentle
slumber
,
smile
through
her
light
and
sunny
dream
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
2
    
<EOS>
after
combat
,
for
nearly
a
week
,
the
feeling
which
impel
me
to
revisit
the
place
I
have
quit
under
the
circumstance
already
detail
,
I
yield
to
it
at
length
;
and
determine
that
this
time
I
would
present
myself
by
the
light
of
day
,
bend
my
step
thither
early
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
past
the
house
,
and
take
several
turn
in
the
street
,
with
that
kind
of
hesitation
which
be
natural
to
a
man
who
be
conscious
that
the
visit
he
be
about
to
pay
be
unexpected
,
and
may
not
be
very
acceptable
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
door
of
the
shop
be
shut
,
and
it
do
not
appear
likely
that
I
should
be
recognize
by
those
within
,
if
I
continue
merely
to
pass
up
and
down
before
it
,
I
soon
conquer
this
irresolution
,
and
find
myself
in
the
Curiosity
Dealer
's
warehouse
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
and
another
person
be
together
in
the
back
part
,
and
there
seem
to
have
be
high
word
between
them
,
for
their
voice
which
be
raise
to
a
very
high
pitch
suddenly
stop
on
my
entering
,
and
the
old
man
advance
hastily
towards
me
,
say
in
a
tremulous
tone
that
he
be
very
glad
I
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
interrupt
us
at
a
critical
moment
,
"
say
he
,
point
to
the
man
whom
I
have
find
in
company
with
him
;
"
this
fellow
will
murder
me
one
of
these
day
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
do
so
,
long
ago
,
if
he
have
dare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bah
!
<EOS>
You
would
swear
away
my
life
if
you
could
,
"
return
the
other
,
after
bestow
a
stare
and
a
frown
on
me
;
"
we
all
know
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
think
I
could
,
"
cry
the
old
man
,
turn
feebly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
if
oath
,
or
prayer
,
or
word
,
could
rid
me
of
you
,
they
should
.
<EOS>
I
would
be
quit
of
you
,
and
would
be
relieve
if
you
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
return
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
so
,
do
not
I
?
<EOS>
but
neither
oath
,
or
prayer
,
nor
word
,
WILL
kill
me
,
and
therefore
I
live
,
and
mean
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
his
mother
die
!
"
cry
the
old
man
,
passionately
clasp
his
hand
and
look
upward
;
"
and
this
be
Heaven
's
justice
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
other
stand
lunge
with
his
foot
upon
a
chair
,
and
regard
him
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
or
thereabout
;
well
make
,
and
certainly
handsome
,
though
the
expression
of
his
face
be
far
from
prepossess
,
have
in
common
with
his
manner
and
even
his
dress
,
a
dissipated
,
insolent
air
which
repel
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
justice
or
no
justice
,
"
say
the
young
fellow
,
"
here
I
be
<EOS>
and
here
I
shall
stop
till
such
time

fit

send
for
assistance

put
me
out

I
want
to

keep
coope
up

poison
her

your
sly
secret

pretend
an
affection

that
you
may
work
her
to
death

add
a
few
scrape
shilling
every
week

you
can
hardly

cry
the

turn
from
him
to
me

"
<EOS>
a

sir

have
forfeit
every
claim
not
only
upon
those
who
have
the
misfortune

be
of

upon
society

<EOS>
say
this
,
he
step
to
the
door
,
and
look
down
the
street
beckon
several
time
to
some
unseen
person
,
who
,
to
judge
from
the
air
of
impatience
with
which
these
signal
be
accompany

require
a
great
quantity

persuasion

at
length
there
saunter
up

side

way

with
a
bad
pretense

by

undertone

Mr

comply

look
about

with
a
propritiatory
smile
,
observe
that
last
week
be
a
fine
week
for

this
week
be

fine
week

"
with
that
,
he
wink
as
if
in
preservation
of
some
deep
secret
,
and
fold
his
arm
and
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
look
up
at
the
ceiling
with
profound
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
not
very
unreasonable
to
suspect
from
what
have
already
pass
,
that
Mr
Swiveller
be
not
quite
recover
from
the
effect
of
the
powerful
sunlight
to
which
he
have
make
allusion
;
but
if
no
such
suspicion
have
be
awaken
by
his
speech
,
his
wiry
hair
,
dull
eye
,
and
sallow
face
would
still
have
be
strong
witness
against
him
.
<EOS>
His
attire
be
not
,
as
he
have
himself
hint
,
remarkable
for
the
 
nice
arrangement
,
but
be
in
a
state
of
disorder
which
strongly
induce
the
idea
that
he
have
go
to
bed
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
consist
of
a
brown
body
-
coat
with
a
great
many
brass
button
up
the
front
and
only
one
behind
,
a
bright
check
neckerchief
,
a
plaid
waistcoat
,
soil
white
trouser
,
and
a
very
limp
hat
,
wear
with
the
wrong
side
foremost
,
to
hide
a
hole
in
the
brim
.
<EOS>
the
breast
of
his
coat
be
ornament
with
an
outside
pocket
from
which
there
peep
forth
the
clean
end
of
a
very
large
and
very
ill
-
favour
handkerchief
;
his
dirty
wristband
be
pull
on
as
far
as
possible
and
ostentatiously
fold
back
over
his
cuff
;
he
display
no
glove
,
and
carry
a
yellow
cane
have
at
the
top
a
bone
hand
with
the
semblance
of
a
ring
on
its
little
finger
and
a
black
ball
in
its
grasp
.
<EOS>
with
all
these
personal
advantage
(
to
which
may
be
add
a
strong
savour
of
tobacco
-
smoke
,
and
a
prevailing
greasiness
of
appearance
)
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
leant
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
ceiling
,
and
occasionally
pitch
his
voice
to
the
needful
key
,
oblige
the
company
with
a
few
bar
of
an
intensely
dismal
air
,
and
then
,
in
the
middle
of
a
note
,
relapse
into
his
former
silence
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
sit
himself
down
in
a
chair
,
and
with
fold
hand
,
look
sometimes
at
his
grandson
and
sometimes
at
his
strange
companion
,
as
if
he
be
utterly
powerless
and
have
no
resource
but
to
leave
them
to
do
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
recline
against
a
table
at
no
great
distance
from
his
friend
,
in
apparent
indifference
to
everything
that
have
pass
;
and
I
---
who
feel
the
difficulty
of
any
interference
,
notwithstanding
that
the
old
man
have
appeal
to
me
,
both
by
word
and
look
---
make
the
good
feint
<EOS>
I
could
of
be
occupy
in
examine
some
of
the
good
that
be
dispose
for
sale
,
and
pay
very
little
attention
to
a
person
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
silence
be
not
of
long
duration
,
for
Mr
Swiveller
,
after
favour
us
with
several
melodious
assurance
that
his
heart
be
in
the
Highlands
,
and
that
he
want
but
his
arab
steed
as
a
preliminary
to
the
achievement
of
great
feat
of
valour
and
loyalty
,
remove
his
eye
from
the
ceiling
and
subside
into
prose
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fred
,
"
say
Mr
Swiveller
stop
short
,
as
if
the
idea
have
suddenly
occur
to
him
,
and
speak
in
the
same
audible
whisper
as
before

what

his

peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

be
he

"
say
Dick
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
what
do
I
care
whether
he
be
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
emboldened
as
it
seem
by
this
reply
to
enter
into
a
more
general
conversation
,
Mr
Swiveller
plainly
lay
himself
out
to
captivate
our
attention
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
by
remark
that
soda
-
water
,
though
a
good
thing
in
the
abstract
,
be
apt
to
lie
cold
upon
the
stomach
unless
qualify
with
ginger
,
or
a
small
infusion
of
brandy
,
which
latter
article
he
hold
to
be
preferable
in
all
case
,
save
for
the
one
consideration
of
expense
.
<EOS>
nobody
venture
to
dispute
these
position
,
he
proceed
to
observe
that
the
human
hair
be
a
great
retainer
of
tobacco
-
smoke
,
and
that
the
young
gentleman
of
Westminster
and
Eton
,
after
eat
vast
quantity
of
apple
to
conceal
any
scent
of
cigar
from
their
anxious
friend
,
be
usually
detect
in
consequence
of
their
head
possess
this
remarkable
property
;
when
he
conclude
that
if
the
Royal
Society
would
turn
their
attention
to
the
circumstance
,
and
endeavour
to
find
in
the
resource
of
science
a
means
of
prevent
such
untoward
revelation
,
they
may
indeed
be
look
upon
as
benefactor
to
mankind
.
<EOS>
these
opinion
be
equally
incontrovertible
with
those
he
have
already
pronounce
,
he
go
on
to
inform
us
that
Jamaica
rum
,
though
unquestionably
an
agreeable
spirit
of
great
richness
and
flavour
,
have
the
drawback
of
remain
constantly
present
to
the
taste
next
day
;
and
nobody
be
venturous
enough
to
argue
this
point
either
,
he
increase
in
confidence
and
become
yet
more
companionable
and
communicative
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
devil
of
a
thing
,
gentleman
,
"
say
Mr
Swiveller
,
"
when
relation
fall
out
and
disagree
.
<EOS>
if
the
wing
of
friendship
should
never
moult
a
feather
,
the
wing
of
relationship
should
never
be
clip
,
but
be
always
expand
and
serene
.
<EOS>
why
should
a
grandson
and
grandfather
peg
away
at
each
other
with
mutual
wiolence
when
all
may
be
bliss
and
concord
.
<EOS>
why
not
jine
hand
and
forgit
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hold
your
tongue
,
"
say
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir

"
reply
Mr
Swiveller
,
"
do
not
you
interrupt
the
chair

<EOS>
gentleman

how
do
the
case
stand

upon
the

<EOS>
here
be
a
jolly

I
say
it
with
the
utmost
respect

and
here
be
a

young

<EOS>
the
jolly
old
grandfather
say
to
the
wild
young
grandson
,
"
I
have
bring
you
up
and
educate
you

Fred
<EOS>
;
I
have
put
you
in
the
way

on

you
have
bolt
a

out

as
young

often
do

and
you
shall
never
have
another
chance
,
nor
the
ghost
of
half
a
one

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
wild
young
grandson
make
answer
to
this
and
say
,
"
You
be
as

rich

you

with

why
can
not
you
stand
a
trifle

your

up

<EOS>
"
the
jolly
old
grandfather
unto
this
,
retort
,
not
only
that
he
decline
to
fork
out
with
that
cheerful
readiness
which
be
always
so
agreeable
and
pleasant
in
a
gentleman
of
his
time
of
life
,
but
that
he
will
bow
up
,
and
call
name
,
and
make
reflection
whenever
they
meet
.
<EOS>
then
the
plain
question
be
,
an't
it
a
pity
that
this
state
of
thing
should
continue
,
and
how
much
better
would
it
be
for
the
gentleman
to
hand
over
a
reasonable
amount
of
tin
,
and
make
it
all
right
and
comfortable
?

<EOS>
have
deliver
this
oration
with
a
great
many
wave
and
flourish
of
the
hand
,
Mr
Swiveller
abruptly
thrust
the
head
of
his
cane
into
his
mouth
as
if
to
prevent
himself
from
impair
the
effect

be
utter

to
reach
the
ear
of

young

<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
appear
to
think
the
they
imply
some
mental
struggle
consequent
upon
the
powerful
effect
of
his
address
,
for
he
poke
his
friend
with
his
cane
and
whisper
his
conviction
that
he
have
administer
"
a
clincher
,
"
and
that
he
expect
a
commission
on
the
profit
.
<EOS>
discover
his
mistake
after
a
while
,
he
appear
to
grow
rather
sleeply
and
discontent
,
and
have
more
than
once
suggest
the
proprieity
of
an
immediate
departure
,
when
the
door
open

and
the

herself
appear

<EOS>
the
child
be
closely
follow
by
an
elderly
man
of
remarkably
hard
feature
and
forbid
aspect
,
and
so
low
in
stature
as
to
be
quite
a
dwarf
,
though
his
head
and
face
be
large
enough
for
the
body
of
a
giant
.
<EOS>
His
black
eye
be
restless
,
sly
,
and
cunning
;
his
mouth
and
chin
,
bristly
with
the
stubble
of
a
coarse
hard
beard
;
and
his
complexion
be
one
of
that
kind
which
never
look
clean
or
wholesome
.
<EOS>
but
what
add
most
to
the
grotesque
expression
of
his
face
be
a
ghastly
smile
,
which
,
appear
to
be
the
mere
result
of
habit
and
to
have
no
connection
with
any
mirthful
or
complacent
feeling
,
constantly
reveal
the
few
discolour
fang
that
be
yet
scatter
in
his
mouth
,
and
give
him
the
aspect
of
a
pant
dog
.
<EOS>
His
dress
consist
of
a
large
high
-
crown
hat
,
a
wear
dark
suit
,
a
pair
of
capacious
shoe
,
and
a
dirty
white
neckerchief
sufficiently
limp
and
crumple
to
disclose
the
great
portion
of
his
wiry
throat
.
<EOS>
such
hair
as
he
have
be
of
a
grizzle
black
,
cut
short
and
straight
upon
his
temple
,
and
hang
in
a
frowzy
fringe
about
his
ear
.
<EOS>
His
hand
,
which
be
of
a
rough
,
coarse
grain
,
be
very
dirty
;
his
fingernail
be
crooked
,
long
,
and
yellow
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
ample
time
to
note
these
particular
,
for
besides
that
they
be
sufficiently
obvious
without
very
close
observation

some
moment
elapse
before
any

broke
silence

<EOS>
the

advance
timidly
towards
her
brother

put
her
hand

glance
keenly

all

plainly

not

his
uncouth
visitor

disconcert
and
embarrassed

<EOS>
"
ah

say
the
dwarf

who
with
his

stretch
out
above

step
up
to
the
dwarf

on

by
these

in

where
he
give
a
great
cough

quite
horrible

little
body

slowly
round

round

round
again

with
something
fantastic

this
slight
action

,
drop
his
shaggy
brow

cock
his

in

glance
upward

a
stealthy
look

exultation

<EOS>
"
here

he

,
put
his

into

sidle
up

take
the

turn
away
with
a
slow

uncertain
step
,

press
his
hand
upon
his
head
like
a
weary
and
dejected
man

<EOS>
the
dwarf
watch
him
sharply
,
while
he
pass
into
the
little
sitting
-
room
and
lock
it
in
an
iron
safe
above
the
chimney
-
piece
;
and
after
muse
for
a
short
space
,
prepared
to
take
his
leave
,
observe
that
unless
he
make
good
haste
,
Mrs

would
certainly
be
in
fit
on
his
return

so

he
add

"
I
will
turn
my

homeward

leave
my
love

hope
she
may
never
lose
her
way
again

so

procure
me
an
honour
I
do
not
expect

"
with
that
he
bow
and
leer
at
me
,
and
with
a
keen
glance
around
which
seem
to
comprehend
every
object
within
his
range
of
vision
,
however
,
small
or
trivial
,
go
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
several
time
essay
to
go
myself
,
but
the
old
man
have
always
oppose
it
and
entreat
me
to
remain
.
<EOS>
as
he
renew
his
entreaty
on
our
be
leave
along
,
and
advert
with
many
thank
to
the
former
occasion
of
our
be
together
,
I
willingly
yield
to
his
persuasion
,
and
sit
down
,
pretend
to
examine
some
curious
miniature
and
a
few
old
medal
which
he
place
before
me
.
<EOS>
It
need
no
great
press
to
induce
me
to
stay
,
for
if
my
curiosity
have
be
excite
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
,
it
certainly
be
not
diminish
now

<EOS>
Nell
join
us
before
long
,
and
bring
some
needle
-
work
to
the
table
,
sit
by
the
old
man
's
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
observe
the
fresh
flower
in
the
room
,
the
pet
bird
with
a
green
bough
shade
his
little
cage
,
the
breath
of
freshness
and
youth
which
seem
to
rustle
through
the
old
dull
house
and
hover
round
the
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
,
but
not
so
pleasant
,
to
turn
from
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
girl
,
to
the
stoop
figure
,
care
-
wear
face
,
and
jade
aspect
of
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
as
he
grow
weak
and
more
feeble
,
what
would
become
of
this
lonely
litle
creature
;
poor
protector
as
he
be
,
say
that
he
die
---
what
we
be
her
fate
,
then
?
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
almost
answer
my
thought
,
as
he
lay
his
hand
on
her
,
and
speak
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
of
well
cheer

Nell

he
say
;
"
there
must
be
good
fortune
in
store
for
thee

---
I
do
not
ask
it
for
myself

thee
.
<EOS>
such
misery
must
fall
on
thy
innocent
head
without
it

that
I
can
not
believe

that

be
tempt

it
will
come
at
last

"
  
<EOS>
She
look
cheerfully
into
his
face
,
but
make
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
of
the
many
year

<EOS>
many
in
thy
short
life

that
thou
have
live
with
me

of
my
monotonous
existence

know
no
companion

any

pleasure

of
the
solitutde
in
which
thou
have
grow
to
be
what
thou
art
,
and
in
which
thou
hast
live
apart
from
nearly
all
thy
kind
but
one
old
man

I
sometimes
fear
I
have
deal
hardly
by
thee

Nell

<EOS>
"
Grandfather

cry
the
child
in
unfeigned
surprise

<EOS>
"
not
in
intention
---
no
no
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
ever
look
forward
to
the
time
that
should
enable
thee
to
mix
among
the
gay
and
prettiest

take
thy
station
with
the
good
.

I
still
look
forward

Nell

I
still
look
forward
,
and
if
I
should
be
force
to
leave
thee
,
meanwhile
,
how
have
I
fit
thee
for
struggle
with
the
world
?
<EOS>
the
poor
bird
yonder
be
as
well
qualified
to
encounter
it
,
and
be
turn
adrift
upon
its
mercy

Hark
!

I
hear
kit
outside
.
<EOS>
go
to
him
,
Nell
,
go
to
him

<EOS>
She
rise
,
and
hurry
away
,
stop
,
turn
back
,
and
put
her
arm
about
the
old
man
's
neck
,
then
leave
him
and
hurry
away
again
---
but
faster
this
time
,
to
hide
her
fall
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
word
in
your
ear
,
sir
,
"
say
the
old
man
in
a
hurried
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
render
uneasy
by
what
you
say
the
other
night
,
and
can
only
plead
that
I
have
do
all
for
the
good
---
that
it
be
too
late
to
retract
,
if
I
could
(
though
I
can
not
)
---
and
that
I
hope
to
triumph
yet
.
<EOS>
all
be
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
I
have
bear
great
poverty
myself
,
and
would
spare
her
the
suffering
that
poverty
carry
with
it

<EOS>
I
would
spare
her
the
misery
that
bring
her
mother
,
my
own
dear
child
,
to
an
early
grave

<EOS>
I
would
leave
her

not
with
resource
which
could
be
easily
spend
or
squander
away
,

with
what
would
place
her
beyond
the
reach
of
want
for
ever

<EOS>
you
mark
me
sir
?
<EOS>
She
shall
have
no
pittance

but
a
fortune

hush
!
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more
than
that
,
now
or
at
any

she
be
here
again

<EOS>
the
eagerness
with
which
all
this
be
pour
into
my
ear

the
trembling
of
the
hand
with
which
he
clasp
my
arm
,
the
strained
and
start
eye
he
fix
upon
me

the
wild
vehemence

agitation
of
his
manner

fill
me
with
amazement

<EOS>
all
that
I
have
hear
and
see
,
and
a
great
part
of
what
he
have
say
himself
,
lead
me
to
suppose
that
he
be
a
wealthy
man
.
<EOS>
I
could
form
no
comprehension

his
character

unless
he
be
one
of
those
miserable
wretch

have
make
gain
the
sole
end

object

have
succeed
in

torture

by
fear

<EOS>
many
thing
he
have
say
which
I
have
be
at
a
loss
to
understand
,
be
quite
reconcilable
with
the
idea
thus
present
to
me
,
and
<EOS>
at
length
I
conclude
that
beyond
all
doubt
he
be
one
of
this
unhappy
race
.
  
<EOS>
the
opinion
be
not
the
result
of
hasty
consideration
,
for
which
indeed
there
be
no
opportunity
at
that
time
,
as
the
child
come
directly
,
and
soon
occupy
herself
in
preparation
for
give
kit
a
writing
lesson
,
of
which
it
seem
he
have
a
couple
every
week
,
and
one
regularly
on
that
evening
,
to
the
great
mirth
and
enjoyment
both
of
himself
and
his
instructress
.
<EOS>
to
relate
how
it
be
a
long
time
before
his
modesty
could
be
so
far
prevail
upon
as
it
admit
of
his
sit
down
in
the
parlour
,
in
the
presence
of
an
unknown
gentleman
---
how
,
when
he
do
set
down
,
he
tuck
up
his
sleeve
and
square
his
elbow
and
put
his
face
close
to
the
copy
-
book
and
squint
horribly
at
the
line
---
<EOS>
how
,
from
the
very
first
moment
of
have
the
pen
in
his
hand
,
he
begin
to
wallow
in
blot
,
and
to
daub
himself
with
ink
up
to
the
very
root
of
his
hair
---
how
,
if
he
do
by
accident
form
a
letter
properly
,
he
immediately
smear
it
out
again
with
his
arm
in
his
preparation
to
make
another
 
---
 
<EOS>
how
,
at
every
fresh
mistake
,
there
be
a
fresh
burst
of
merriment
from
the
child
and
louder
and
not
less
hearty
laugh
from
poor
kit
himself
---
and
how
there
be
all
the
way
through
,
notwithstanding
,
a
gentle
wish
on
her
part
to
teach
,
and
an
anxious
desire
on
his
to
learn
---
to
relate
all
these
particular
would
no
doubt
occupy
more
space
and
time
than
they
deserve
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
the
lesson
be
give
---
that
evening
pass
and
night
come
on
---
that
the
old
man
again
grow
restless
and
impatient
---
that
he
quit
the
house
secretly
at
the
same
hour
as
before
---
and
that
the
child
be
once
more
leave
alone
within
its
gloomy
wall
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
that
I
have
carry
this
history
so
far
in
my
own
character
and
introduce
these
personage
to
the
reader
<EOS>
,
I
shall
for
the
convenience
of
the
narrative
detach
myself
from
its
further
course

leave
those

Mr

in
which

burrowing
all

<EOS>
on
Quilp

Wharf
,
Daniel
Quilp
be
a
ship

breaker
,
yet
to
judge
from
these
appearance
he
must
either
have
be
a
ship
-
breaker
on
a
very
small
scale
,
or
have
break
his
ship
up
very
small
indeed
.
<EOS>
neither
do
the
place
present
any
extraordinary
aspect
of
life
or
activity
,
as
its
only
human
occupant
be
an
amphibious
boy
in
a
canvas
suit
,
whose
sole
change
of
occupation
be
from
sit
on
the
head
of
a
pile
and
throw
stone
into
the
mud
when
the
tide
be
out
,
to
stand
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
gaze
listlessly
on
the
motion
and
on

of

<EOS>
the

lodging
on
Tower
hill
comprise
,
besides
the
needful
accommodation
for

and
Mrs

,
a
small
sleeping

for
that
lady
's
mother
,
who
reside
with
the
couple
and
wage
perpetual
war
with
Daniel
;
of
whom
,
notwithstanding
,
she
stand
in
no
slight
dread
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
ugly
creature
contrive
by
some
mean
or
other
---
whether
by
his
ugliness
or
his
ferocity
or
his
natural
cunning
be
no
great
matter
---
to
impress
with
a
wholesome
fear
of
his
anger
,
most
of
those
with
whom
he
be
bring
into
daily
contact
and
communication
.
<EOS>
over
nobody
have
he
such
complete
ascendance
as
Mrs
Quilp
herself
---
a
pretty
little
,
mild
-
spoken
,
blue
-
eyed
woman
,
who
have
ally
herself
in
wedlock
to
the
dwarf
in
one
of
those
strange
infatuation
of
which
example
be
by
no
means
scarce
,
perform
a
sound
practical
penance
for
her
folly
,
every
day
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
Mrs
Quilp
be
pine
in
her
bower
.
<EOS>
in
her
bower
she
be
,
but
not
alone
,
for
besides
the
old
lady
her
mother
of
whom
mention
have
recently
be
make
,
there
be
present
some
half
-
dozen
lady
of
the
neighborhood
who
have
happen
by
a
strange
accident
(
and
also
by
a
little
understanding
among
themselves
)
to
drop
in
one
after
another
,
just
about
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
season
favourable
to
conversation
,
and
the
room
be
a
cool
,
shady
,
lazy
kind
of
place
,
with
some
plant
at
the
open
window
shut
out
the
dust
,
and
interpose
pleasantly
enough
between
the
tea
table
within
and
the
old
Tower
without
,
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
lady
feel
an
inclination
to
talk
and
linger
,
especially
when
there
be
take
into
account
the
additional
inducement
of
fresh
butter
,
new
bread
,
shrimp
,
and
watercress
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
lady
be
together
under
these
circumstance
,
it
be
extremely
natural
that
the
discourse
should
turn
upon
the
propensity
of
mankind
to
tyrannize
over
the
weak
sex
,
and
the
duty
that
develop
upon
the
weak
sex
to
resist
that
tyranny
and
assert
their
right
and
dignity
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
for
four
reason
:
firstly
,
because
Mrs
Quilp
be
a
young
woman
and
notoriously
under
the
dominion
of
her
husband
ought
to
be
excited
to
rebel
;
secondly
,
because
Mrs
Quilp
's
parent
be
know
to
be
laudably
shrewish
in
her
disposition
and
incline
to
resist
male
authority
;
thirdly
,
because
each
visitor
wish
to
show
for
herself
how
superior
she
be
in
this
respect
to
the
generality
of
her
sex
;
and
forthly
,
because
the
company
be
accustom
to
acandalise
each
other
in
pair
,
be
deprive
of
their
usual
subject
of
conversation
now
that
they
be
all
assemble
in
close
friendship
,
and
have
consequently
no
well
employment
than
to
attack
the
common
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
move
by
these
consideration
,
a
stout
lady
open
the
proceeding
by
inquire
,
with
an
air
of
great
concern
and
sympathy
,
how
Mr
Quilp
be
;
<EOS>
whereunto
Mr
Quilp
's
wife
's
mother
reply
sharply
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
He
be
well
enough
---
nothing
much
be
every
the
matter
with
him
---
and
ill
weed
be
sure
to
thrive
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
lady
then
sigh
in
concert
,
shake
their
head
gravely
,
and
look
at
Mrs
Quilp
as
a
martyr
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
the
spokeswoman
,
"
I
wish
you
would
give
her
a
little
of
your
advice
,
Mrs
Jiniwin
"
---
<EOS>
Mrs
Quilp
have
be
a
Miss
Jiniwin
<EOS>
it
should
be
observe
<EOS>
---
"
nobody
know
well
than
you
,
madam
,
what
us
woman
owe
to
ourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
owe
indeed
,
madam
!
"
reply
Mrs
Jiniwin
.
<EOS>
"
when
my
poor
husband
,
her
dear
father
,
be
alive
,
if
he
have
ever
venture'd
a
cross
word
to
me
,
I
would
have
---
"
the
good
old
lady
do
not
finish
the
sentence
,
but
she
twist
off
the
head
of
a
shrimp
with
a
vindictiveness
which
seem
to
imply
that
the
action
be
in
some
degree
a
substitute
for
word
.
<EOS>
in
this
light
it
be
clearly
understand
by
the
other
party
,
who
immediately
reply
with
great
approbation
,
"
You
quite
enter
into
my
feeling
,
madam
,
and
it
be
jist
what
I
would
do
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
no
call
to
do
it
,
"
say
Mrs
Jiniwin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
luckily
for
you
,
you
have
no
more
occasion
to
do
it
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
woman
nee
have
,
if
she
be
true
to
herself
,
"
rejoin
the
stout
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
that
,
Betsy
?
"
say
Mrs
Jiniwin
,
in
a
warning
voice
.
<EOS>
"
how
often
have
I
say
the
same
word
to
you
,
and
almost
go
down
my
knee
when
I
speak
'
em
!
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs
Quilp
,
who
have
look
in
a
state
of
helplessness
from
one
face
of
condolence
to
another
,
colour
,
smile
,
and
shake
her
head
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
signal
for
a
general
clamour
,
which
begin
in
a
low
murmur
gradually
swell
into
a
great
noise
in
which
everybody
speak
at
once
,
and
all
say
that
she
be
a
young
woman
have
no
right
to
set
up
her
opinion
against
the
experience
of
those
who
know
so
much
well
;
that
it
be
very
wrong
of
her
not
to
take
the
advice
of
people
who
have
nothing
at
heart
but
her
good
;
that
it
be
next
door
to
be
downright
ungrateful
to
conduct
herself
in
that
manner
;
that
if
she
have
no
respect
for
herself
she
ought
to
have
some
for
other
woman
,
all
of
whom
she
compromise
by
her
meekness
;
and
that
if
she
have
no
respect
for
other
woman
,
the
time
would
come
when
other
woman
would
have
no
respect
for
her
;
and
she
would
be
very
sorry
for
that
,
they
could
tell
her
.
<EOS>
have
deal
out
these
admonition
,
the
lady
fall
to
a
more
powerful
assault
than
they
have
yet
make
upon
the
 
mixed
tea
,
new
bread
,
fresh
butter
,
shrimp
,
and
watercress
,
and
say
that
their
vexation
be
so
great
to
see
her
go
on
like
that
,
that
they
could
hardly
bring
themselves
to
eat
a
single
morsel
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
fine
to
talk
,
"
say
Mrs
Quilp
with
much
simplicity
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
if
I
be
to
die
to
-
morrow
,
Quilp
could
marry
anybody
he
please
---
now
that
he
could
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
quite
a
scream
of
indignation
at
this
idea
.
<EOS>
marry
whom
he
please
!
<EOS>
They
would
like
to
see
him
dare
to
think
of
marry
any
of
them
;
they
would
like
to
see
the
faint
approach
to
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
one
lady
(
a
widow
)
be
quite
certain
she
should
stab
him
if
he
hint
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
Mrs
Quilp
,
nod
her
head
,
"
as
I
say
just
now
,
it
be
very
easy
to
talk
,
but
I
say
again
that
I
know
---
that
I
be
sure
---
<EOS>
Quilp
have
such
a
way
with
him
when
he
like
,
that
the
good
looking
woman
here
could
not
refuse
him
if
I
be
dead
,
and
she
be
free
,
and
he
choose
to
make
love
to
him
.
<EOS>
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
everybody
bridle
up
at
this
remark
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
know
you
mean
me
.
<EOS>
let
him
try
---
that
be
all
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
for
some
hide
reason
they
be
all
angry
with
the
widow
,
and
each
lady
whisper
in
her
neighbour
's
ear
that
it
be
very
plain
that
say
widow
think
herself
the
person
refer
to
,
and
what
a
puss
she
be
!
  
<EOS>
"
mother
know
,
"
say
Mrs
Quilp
,
"
that
what
I
say
be
quite
correct
,
for
she
often
say
so
before
we
be
married
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
say
so
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
inquiry
involve
the
respected
lady
in
rather
a
delicate
position
,
for
she
certainly
have
be
an
active
party
in
make
her
daughter
Mrs
Quilp
,
and
,
besides
,
it
be
not
support
the
family
credit
to
encourage
the
idea
that
she
have
marry
a
man
whom
nobody
else
would
have
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
to
exaggerate
the
captivate
quality
of
her
son
-
in
-
law
would
be
to
weaken
the
cause
of
revolt
,
in
which
all
her
energy
be
deeply
engaged
.
<EOS>
Beset
by
these
oppose
consideration
,
Mrs
Jiniwin
admit
the
power
of
insinuation
,
but
deny
the
right
to
govern
,
and
with
a
timely
compliment
to
the
stout
lady
bring
back
the
discussion
to
the
point
from
which
it
have
stray
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
sensible
and
proper
thing
indeed
,
what
Mrs
George
have
say
,
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
if
woman
be
only
true
to
themselves
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
Betsy
be
not
,
and
more
be
the
shame
and
pity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
would
let
a
man
order
me
about
as
Quilp
order
her
,
"
say
Mrs
George
,
"
before
I
would
consent
to
stand
in
awe
of
a
man
as
she
do
of
him
<EOS>
,
I
would
---
<EOS>
I
would
kill
myself
,
and
write
a
letter
first
to
say
he
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
remark
be
loudly
commend
and
approve
of
,
another
lady
(
from
the
Minories
)
put
in
her
word
:
  
"
<EOS>
Mr
Quilp
may
be
a
very
nice
man
,
"
say
this
lady
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
no
doubt
he
be
,
because
Mrs
Quilp
say
he
be
,
and
Mrs
Jiniwin
say
he
be
,
and
they
ought
to
know
,
or
nobody
do
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
be
not
quite
a
---
what
one
call
a
handsome
man
,
nor
quite

Mrs

faint
demonstration
of
rebellion
by
sit
down
in
a
chair
near
the

and
fold
her
arm
as
if
in
a
resolute
determination
to
do
nothing

<EOS>
but
a
few
whisper
word
from
her
daughter
,
and
a
kind
inquiry
from
her
son
-
in

law
whether
she

faint
,
with
a
hint
that
there
be
abundance
of
cold

while

back
his
coat

collar
,
proceed
to
smear
his
countenance
with
a
damp
towel
of
very
unwholesome
appearance
,
which
make
his
complexion
rather
more
cloudy
than
it
be
before
.
<EOS>
but
,
while
he
be
thus
engage
,
his
caution
and
inquisitiveness
do
not
forsake
him
,
for
with
a
face
as
sharp
and
cunning
as
ever
,
he
often
stop
,
even
in
this
short
process
,
and
stand
listen
for
any
conversation
in
the
next
room
,
of
which
he
may
be
the
theme
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
after
a
short
effort
of
attention
,
"
it

not
the
towel
over
my

I

<EOS>
I

a
monster

Mrs

<EOS>
oh

"
  
<EOS>
the
pleasure
of
this
discovery
call
up
the
old
doglike
smile
in
full
force
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
quite
do
with
it
,
he
shake
himself
in
a
very
doglike
manner
,
and
rejoin
the

<EOS>
Mr

now
walk
up
to
front
of
a
looking

glass
,
and
be
stand
there
put
on
his
neckerchief
,
when
Mrs
Jiniwin
happen
to
be
behind
him
,
could
not
resist
the
inclination
she
feel
to
shake
her
fist
at
her
tyrant
son
-
in

law
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
gesture
of
an
instant
,
but
as
she
do
so
and
accompany
the
action
with
a
menacing
look
,
she
meet
his
eye
in
the
glass
,
catch
her
in
the
very
act
.
<EOS>
the
same
glance
at
the
mirror
convey
to
her
the
reflection
of
a
horribly
grotesque
and
distorted
face
with
the
tongue
loll
out
;
and
the
next
instant
the
dwarf
,
turn
about
with
a
perfectly
bland
and
placid
look
,
inquire
in
a
tone
of
great
affection

"
how

old
darling

"
  
<EOS>
slight
and
ridiculous
as
the
incident
be
<EOS>
,
it
make
him
appear
such
a
little
fiend
,
and
withal
such
a
keen
and
know
one
,
that
the
old
woman
feel
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
utter
a
single
word
,
and
suffer
herself
to
be
lead
with
extraordinary
politeness
to
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
here
he
by
no
means
diminish
the
impression
he
have
just

,
for
he

devour
gigantic
prawn

the
head
and
tail
on

chew
tobacco
and
water

cress
at
the

time

with
extraordinary
greediness
,
drink
boil
tea
without
wink
,
bit
his
fork
and
spoon
till
they
bend
again
,
and
in
short
perform
so
many
horrifying
and
uncommon
act
that
the
woman
be
nearly
frighten
out
of
their
wit
,
and
begin
to
doubt
if
he
be
really
a
human
creature
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
have
go
through
these
proceeding
and
many
other
which
be
equally
a
part
of
his
system
,
Mr
Quilp
leave
them
,
reduce
to
a
very
obedient

to

<EOS>
He

Mr

expressively
in

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
with
these
threat
he
clench
his

and
dexterously
diving
in

but
desist
when
he
look
round
and
see
that
Quilp
be
follow
him
with
a
steady
look

<EOS>
and
here
it
may
be
remark
,
that
between
this
boy
and
the
dwarf
that
exist
a
strange
kind
of
mutual
liking

<EOS>
how
bear

nourish
upon
blow

threat
on

side

<EOS>
Quilp
would
certainly
suffer
nobody
to
contract
him

the
boy

the

would
assuredly
not

knock

this

Little

the
countenance
of
Mr

as
he
read
the

plainly
show
by
her
look
that
while
she
entertain
some
fear
and
distrust
of
the
little
man
,
she
be
much
incline
to
laugh
at
his
uncouth
appearance
and
grotesque
attitude
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
visible
on
the
part
of
the
child
a
painful
anxiety
for
his
reply
,
and
consciousness
of
his
power
to
render
it
disagreeable
or
distressing
,
which
be
strongly
at
variance
with
this
impulse
and
restrain
it
more
effectually
than

by
any

<EOS>
that

sufficiently
obvious

before

have
get
through
the
first
two
or
three
line
he
begin

open
his
eye
very
wide

to
frown
most
horribly
,
the
next
two
or
three
cause
him
to
scratch
his
head
in
an
uncommonly
vicious
manner

manner

deal
such
blow

it
with
his

when

send
him
reel
backwards

manoeuvre
tickle
Mr

you

grieve
me
sometimes

I

then

we
often

it
better

<EOS>
such
an
application

Mr

Drury
Lane

and
in
addition
to
this
convenience
of
situation
have
the
advantage
of
be
over
a
tobacconist
's
shop
,
so
that
he
be
enable
to
procure
a
refreshing
sneeze
at
any
time
by
merely
step
out
upon
the
staircase
,
and
be
save
the
trouble
and
expense
of
maintain
a
snuff

<EOS>
It
be
in
these
apartment
that
Mr

make
use
of
the
expression

the
consolation
and
encouragement
of
his
desponding
friend

and
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
or
improper
to
remark
that
even
these
brief
observation
partook
in
a
double
sense
of
the
figurative
and
poetical
character
of
Mr
Swiveller
's
mind
,
as
the
rosy
wine
be
in
fact
represent
by
one
glass
of
cold
gin
-
and
-
water
,
which
be
replenish
as
occasion
require
from
a
bottle
and
jug
upon
the
table
,
and
be
pass
from
one
to
another
,
in
a
scarcity
of
tumbler
which
,
as
Mr
Swiveller
's
be
a
bachelor
's
establishment

may
be
acknowledge
without

<EOS>
by
a
like
pleasant
fiction
his

chamber

<EOS>
in
its
disengaged
time

the
tobacconist
have
announce
it
in
his
window
as
"
apartment

for
a
single
gentleman
,
and
Mr
Swiveller
,
follow
up
the
hint
,
never
fail
to
speak
of
it
as
his
room
,
his
lodging
,
or
his
chamber
,
convey
to
his
hearer
a
notion
of
indefinite
space

leave
their
imagination
to
wander
through
long
suite

<EOS>
in
this
flight
of
fancy
,
Mr

be
assist
by
a
deceptive
piece
of
furniture
,
in
reality
a
bedstead
,
but
in
semblance
a
bookcase
,
which
occupy
a
prominent
situation
in
his
chamber
and
seem
to
defy
suspicion
and
challenge
inquiry

<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
by
day
Mr
Swiveller
firmly
believe
this
secret
convenience
to
be
a
bookcase
and
nothing
more
;
that
he
close
his
eye
to
the
bed
,
resolutely
deny
the
existence
of
the
blanket
,
and
spurn
the
bolster
from
his
thought

<EOS>
no
word
of
its
real
use

no

its
nightly
service

its

ever

between
him
and
his

intimate
friend

<EOS>
implicit
faith

the
deception

the
first
article

<EOS>
to

you
must
reject

It

it

"

the

Mr

hear
this
account
with
a
degree
of
admiration
not
altogether
consistent

which
he
have
just
concur

but
his
friend
attach
very
little
importance
to
his

in
this
respect

probably
because
he
know

influence
sufficient

sharpen
in

and
appetite

Mr

forward
the

message
to
another

more
distant
eating

house
,
add
to
it
by
way
of
rider
that
the
gentleman
be
induce
to
send
so
far
,
not
only
by
the
great
fame
and
popularity
its
beef
have
acquire
,
but
in
consequence
of
the
extreme
toughness
of
the
beef
retail
at
the
obdurant
cook
's
shop
,
which
render
it
quite
unfit
not
merely
for
gentlemanly
food
,
but
for
any
human
consumption
.
<EOS>
the
good
effect
of
this
politic
course
be
demonstrate
by
the
speedy
arrive
of
a
small
pewter
pyramid

curously
construct
of

whereof
the
boil

beef

form
the

a

the

all

very
elegant
not

brilliant

such

so
strange

the

neither

at
any
time
greatly
favour
the
pretension
of
Mr

be
accustom

make
slight
mention

ominously

<EOS>
Mr

conduct
in
respect

have
be
of
that
vague

dilitory
kind

usually

upon
as
betoken
no

the

know
to

ready
with
his
offer
on
the
small
encouragement

and
hence
---
as
this

have
be
specially
assign
for
the
purpose
---
that
great
anxiety
on
her
part
for
Richard

have
occasion
her
to
leave
the

affect
him
not

he
be
debate
in
his
mind
how
he
could
best
turn
jealous

and
wish
that
Sophy
be
for
that
occasion
only
far
less
pretty
than
she
be

or
that
she
be
her

serve

Hereupon
Miss

Cheggs
(
who
be
bashful
before

blush
too

Miss
Sophy

mother

prevent
Mr

from
blush
more

lavish

attention

here
be
the
very
thing

here
be
good

have
come
expressly
to

not

Richard

his
impudence

despondingly
in

contemplate
the
glorious
figure

nor

lest

should
fall
upon

entreat
Miss

feebly

the
heaviness
of
the
cloud
which
overhang
her
home

dark
shadow
on
its

besides
that
it

impart
to
any
person
not
intimately
acquaint
with
the
life
she

,
an
adequate
sense
of
its
gloom
and
loneliness
,
a
constant
fear

in
some

uncheere
by

not
the
dark
dreary

it
be
not
the
absence

easy

or
the

to
be
agitate
at

with
a
dreadful
fear
that
his

wander

to
trace
in

the
dawning
of
despondent
madness
;
to
watch

wait

listen
for
confirmation

these

they
be
alone
in

with
no

to

these

sit
heavily
on
an
old

with
many
influence
at

gladden

how
heavily
on
the

constantly
surround

and
yet
,
to
the

Nell

still
the

<EOS>
when

could
,
for
a

,
disengage
his

from
the
phantom
that
haunt

brood
on
it
always
,
there
be
his
young
companion
with
the

the

earnest
word

the

merry

the

deep
into

and
so

content

little
dreaming

old

sterner

to
while
away
the
tedious
hour
,
and
sit
in
one
of
them
,
she
be
still
and
motionless
as
their
inanimate
occupant
,
and
have
no
heart
to
startle
the
echo
---
hoarse
from
their
long
silence
---
with
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
room
,
be
a
window
look
into
the
street
,
where
the
child
sit
,
many
and
many
a
long
evening
,
and
often
far
into
the
night
,
alone
and
thoughtful
.
 
<EOS>
none
be
so
anxious
as
those
who
watch
and
wait
;
at
these
time
,
mournful
fancy
come
flock
on
her
mind
,
in
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
take
her
station
here
,
at
dusk
,
and
watch
the
people
as
they
pass
up
and
down
the
street
,
or
appear
at
the
window
of
the
opposite
house
;
wonder
whether
those
room
be
as
lonesome
as
that
in
which
she
sit
,
and
whether
those
people
feel
it
company
to
see
her
sit
there
,
as
she
do
only
to
see
them
look
out
and
draw
in
their
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
crooked
stack
of
chimney
on
one
of
the
roof
,
in
which
,
by
often
look
at
them
,
she
have
fancy
ugly
face
that
be
frown
over
at
her
and
try
to
peer
into
the
room
;
and
she
feel
glad
when
it
grow
too
dark
to
make
them
out
,
though
she
be
sorry
too
,
when
the
man
come
to
light
the
lamp
in
the
street
---
for
it
make
it
late
,
and
very
dull
inside
.
<EOS>
then
,
she
would
draw
in
her
head
to
look
round
the
room
and
see
that
everything
be
in
its
place
and
have
not
move
;
and
look
out
into
the
street
again
,
would
perhaps
see
a
man
pass
with
a
coffin
on
his
back
,
and
two
or
three
other
silently
follow
him
to
a
house
where
somebody
lie
dead
;
which
make
her
shudder
and
think
of
such
thing
until
they
suggest
afresh
the
old
man
's
altered
face
and
manner
,
and
a
new
train
of
fear
and
speculation
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
die
---
if
sudden
illness
have
happen
to
him
,
and
he
be
never
to
come
home
again
,
alive
---
if
,
one
night
,
he
should
come
home
,
and
kiss
and
bless
her
as
usual
,
and
after
she
have
go
to
bed
and
have
fall
asleep
and
be
perhaps
dream
pleasantly
,
and
smile
in
her
sleep
,
he
should
kill
himself
and
his
blood
come
creep
,
creep
,
on
the
ground
to
her
own
bed
-
room
door
!
 
<EOS>
these
thought
be
too
terrible
to
dwell
upon
,
and
again
she
would
have
recourse
to
the
street
,
now
trodden
by
few
foot
,
and
dark
and
more
silent
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
shop
be
close
fast
,
and
light
begin
to
shine
from
the
upper
window
,
as
the
neighbour
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
these
dwindle
away
and
disappear
or
be
replace
,
here
and
there
,
by
a
feeble
rush
-
candle
which
be
to
burn
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
one
late
shop
at
no
great
distance
which
send
forth
a
ruddy
glare
upon
the
pavement
even
yet
,
and
look
bright
and
companionable
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
a
little
time
,
this
close
,
the
light
be
extinguish
,
and
all
be
gloomy
and
quiet
,
except
when
some
stray
footstep
sound
on
the
pavement
,
or
a
neighbour
,
out
later
than
his
will
not
,
knock
lustily
at
his
house
-
door
to
rouse
the
sleep
inmate
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
night
have
wear
away
thus
far
(
and
seldom
now
until
it
have
)
<EOS>
the
child
would
close
the
window
,
and
steal
softly
down
stair
,
think
as
she
go
that
if
one
of
those
hideous
face
below
,
which
often
mingle
with
her
dream
,
be
to
meet
her
by
the
way
,
render
itself
visible
by
some
strange
light
of
its
own
,
how
terrified
she
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
fear
vanish
before
a
well
-
trim
lamp
and
the
familiar
aspect
of
her
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
after
pray
fervently
,
and
with
many
burst
tear
,
for
the
old
man
,
and
the
restoration
of
his
peace
of
mind
and
the
happiness
they
have
once
enjoy
,
she
would
lay
her
head
upon
the
pillow
and
sob
herself
to
sleep
:
often
start
up
again
,
before
the
day
-
light
come
,
to
listen
for
the
bell
and
respond
to
the
imaginary
summon
which
have
rouse
her
from
her
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
,
the
third
after
Nelly

,
the

who

the

Daniel
Quilp
neither
enter
nor
leave
the
old
man
's
house
,
unobserved
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
shadow
of
an
archway
nearly
opposite
,
lead
to
one
of
the
many
passage
which
diverge
from
the
main
street
,
there
linger
one
,
who
,
have
take
up
his
position
when
the
twilight
first
come
on
,
still
maintain
it
with
undiminished
patience
,
and
lean
against
the
wall
with
the
manner
of
a
person
who
have
a
long
time
to
wait
,
and
be
well
used
to
it
be
quite
resign
,
scarcely
change
his
attitude
for
the
hour
together
.
  
<EOS>
this
patient
lounger
attract
little
attention
from
any
of
those
who
pass
,
and
bestow
as
little
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
be
constantly
direct
towards
one
object
;
the
window
at
which
the
child
be
accustomed
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
withdraw
them
for
a
moment
,
it
be
only
to
glance
at
a
clock
in
some
neighbouring
shop
,
and
then
to
strain
his
sight
once
more
in
the
old
quarter
with
increase
earnestness
and
attention
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
remark
that
this
personage
evince
no
weariness
in
his
place
of
concealment
;
nor
do
he
,
long
as
his
waiting
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
time
go
on
,
he
manifest
some
anxiety
and
surprise
,
glance
at
the
clock
more
frequently
and
at
the
window
less
hopefully
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
clock
be
hide
from
his
sight
by
some
envious
shutter
,
then
the
church
steeple
proclaim
eleven
at
night
,
then
the
quarter
past
,
and
then
the
conviction
seem
to
obtrude
itself
on
his
mind
that
it
be
no
use
tarry
there
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
conviction
be
an
unwelcome
one
,
and
that
he
be
by
no
mean
willing
to
yield
to
it
,
be
apparent
from
his
reluctance
to
quit
the
spot
;
from
the
tardy
step
with
which
he
often
leave
it
,
still
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
same
window
;
and
from
the
precipitation
with
which
he
as
often
return
,
when
a
fancied
noise
or
the
change
and
imperfect
light
induce
him
to
suppose
it
have
be
softly
raise
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
he
give
the
matter
up
,
as
hopeless
for
that
night
,
and
suddenly
break
into
a
run
as
though
to
force
himself
away
,
scamper
off
at
his
utmost
speed
,
nor
once
venture
to
look
behind
him
lest
he
should
be
tempt
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
without
relax
his
pace
,
or
stop
to
take
breath
,
this
mysterious
individual
dash
on
through
a
great
many
alley
and
narrow
way
until
he
at
length
arrive
in
a
square
pave
court
,
when
he
subside
into
a
walk
,
and
make
for
a
small
house
from
the
window
of
which
a
light
be
shine
,
lift
the
latch
of
the
door
and
pass
in
.

with

down
by

very
mournful

discontent

the
poor

still
hard
at
work
at
an
ironing

table
;
a
young

lie

in
a

near

another

a
sturdy
boy
of
two

three
year
old

very
wide
awake
,
with
a
very
tight
night

cap
on
his

a

gown
very

on

sit
bolt
upright
in
a

stare
over
the

round
eye

look
as

thoroughly
make
up
his

never

as

in

open
a
cheerful

It

rather
a

at
the
young

soundly

from
him
to
his
other

from
him
to
their

,
who
have
be
at
work
without

since
morning

think
it
would
be
a
well

kind

good

he
rock
the

look
out
,
from
among
the
old
furniture
,
the
handsome
and
most
commodious
chair
he
could
possibly
find
(
which
he
reserve
for
his
own
use
)
and
an
especially
hideous
and
uncomfortable
one
(
which
he
considerately
appropriate
to
the
accommodation
of
his
friend
)
<EOS>
he
cause
them
to
be
carry
into
this
room
,
and
take
up
his
position
in
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
very
far
remove
from
the
old
man
's
chamber
,
but
Mr
Quilp
deem
it
prudent
,
as
a
precaution
against
infection
from
fever
,
and
a
means
of
wholesome
fumigation
,
not
only
to
smoke
,
himself
,
without
cessation
,
but
to
insist
upon
it
that
his
legal
friend
do
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
send
an
express
to
the
wharf
for
the
tumble
boy
,
who
arrive
with
all
despatch
be
enjoin
to
sit
himself
down
in
another
chair
just
inside
the
door
,
continually
to
smoke
a
great
pipe
which
the
dwarf
have
provide
for
the
purpose
,
and
to
take
it
from
his
lip
under
any
pretence
whatever
,
be
it
only
for
one
minute
at
a
time
,
if
he
dare
.
 
<EOS>
these
arrangement
complete
,
Mr
Quilp
look
round
him
with
chuckle
satisfaction
,
and
remark
that
he
call
that
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
the
legal
gentleman
,
whose
melodious
name
be
Brass
,
may
have
call
it
comfort
also
but
for
two
drawback
:
one
be
,
that
he
could
by
no
exertion
sit
easy
in
his
chair
,
the
seat
of
which
be
very
hard
,
angular
,
slippery
,
and
sloping
;
the
other
,
<EOS>
that
tobacco
-
smoke
always
cause
him
great
internal
discomposure
and
annoyance
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
be
quite
a
creature
of
Mr
Quilp
's
and
have
a
thousand
reason
for
conciliate
his
good
opinion
,
he
try
to
smile
,
and
nod
his
acquiescence
with
the
good
grace
he
could
assume
.
  
<EOS>
this
Brass
be
an
attorney
of
no
very
good
repute
,
from
Bevis
Marks
in
the
city
of
London
;
he
be
a
tall
,
meagre
man
,
with
a
nose
like
a
wen
,
a
protrude
forehead
,
retreat
eye
,
and
hair
of
a
deep
red
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
long
black
surtout
reach
nearly
to
his
ankle
,
short
black
trouser
,
high
shoe
,
and
cotton
stocking
of
a
bluish
grey
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
cringing
manner
,
but
a
very
harsh
voice
;
and
his
bland
smile
be
so
extremely
forbidding
,
that
to
have
have
his
company
under
the
least
repulsive
circumstance
,
one
would
have
wish
him
to
be
out
of
temper
that
he
may
only
scowl
.
  
<EOS>
Quilp
look
at
his
legal
adviser
,
and
see
that
he
be
wink
very
much
in
the
anguish
of
his
pipe
,
that
he
sometimes
shudder
when
he
happen
to
inhale
its
full
flavour
,
and
that
he
constantly
fan
the
smoke
from
him
,
be
quite
overjoyed
and
rub
his
hand
with
glee
.
  
<EOS>
"
smoke
away
,
you
dog
,
"
say
Quilp
,
turn
to
the
boy
;
"
fill
your
pipe
again
and
smoke
it
fast
,
down
to
the
last
whiff
,
or
I
will
put
the
sealing
-
wax
end
of
it
in
the
fire
and
rub
it
<EOS>
red
hot
upon
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
luckily
the
boy
be
case
-
harden
,
and
would
have
smoke
a
small
lime
-
kiln
if
anybody
have
treat
him
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
he
only
mutter
a
brief
defiance
of
his
master
,
and
do
as
he
be
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
good

Brass

do
you
feel
like

say
Quilp

<EOS>
Mr
Brass
think
that
if
he
do
,
the
Grand
Turk
's
feeling
be
by
no
means

he
feel
very

Potentate

"
this
be
the
way

<EOS>
Mr
Brass
encourage
this
idea
,
as
he
would
have
encourage
any
other
emanate
from
the

source

in
to
try
the
effect

<EOS>
this
he
do
,
by
throw
himself
on
his
back
upon
the
bed
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth

and
then
kick
up
his
leg
and
smoke
violently
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Brass
applaud
this
picture
very
much
,
and
the
bed
be
soft
and
comfortable
,
Mr
Quilp
determine
to
use
it
,
both
as
a
sleep
place
by
night
and
as
a
kind
of
Divan
by
day
;
and
in
order
that
it
may
be
convert
to
the
latter
purpose
at
once
,
remain
where
he
be
,
and
smoke
his
pipe
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
legal
gentleman
be
by
this
time
rather
giddy
and
perplex
in
his
idea
<EOS>
(
for
this
be
one
of
the
operation
of
the
tobacco
on

nervous
system

the
opportunity

slink
away
into
the
open
air

where

in
course
of
time

sufficiently
to
return
with
a
countenance
of
tolerable
composure

<EOS>
He
be
soon
lead
on
by
the
malicious
dwarf
to
smoke
himself
into
a
relapse
,
and
in
that
state
stumble
upon
a
settee
where
he
sleep
till
morning

such
be
Mr

first
proceeding

He

with
the
assistance
of
Mr

,
a
minute
inventory
of
all
the
good
in
the
place

and
go
abroad
upon
his
other
concern
which
happily
engage
him
for
several
hour
at
a
time

His
avarice
and
caution
being
,
now

thoroughly
awaken

however

he
be
never
absent
from
the
house
one
night

his
eagerness
for
some
termination

itself
in
open
murmur

exclamation
of
impatience

<EOS>
Nell
shrink
timidly
from
all
the
dwarf
's
advance
towards
conversation
,
and
flee
from
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
;
nor
be
the
lawyer
's
smile
less
terrible
to
her
than
Quilp
's
grimace
.
 
<EOS>
She
live
in
such
continual
dread
and
apprehension
of
meet
one
or
other
of
them
on
the
stair

in
the
passage
if
she
stir
from
her
grandfather

that
she
seldom
leave

for
a
moment

until
late
at
night

when
the
silence
encourage
her
to
venture
forth
and
breathe
the
purer
air
of
some
empty
room

one
night

We

It

the

that
I
ask
the
favour

It

I
have
be
wait
about
so
long
in
hope
to
see
you

do
not

that
I
would
come
in
a
time
of
trouble
to

of
such

as
them

<EOS>
the
child
look
gratefully
and
kindly
at
him
,
but
wait
that
he
may
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not
that

"
say
kit
hesitating
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
something
very
different
from
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
much
sense
,
I
know
,
but
if
he
could
be
bring
to
believe
that
I
would
be
a
faithful
servant
to
him
,
do
the
good
I
could
,
and
never
mean
harm

perhaps
he
might
not

"
  
<EOS>
here
kit
falter
so
long
that
the
child
entreat
him
to
speak
out
,
and
quickly
,
for
it
be
very
late
,
and
time
to
shut
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he

it
over
venturesome
of
me
to

well

to
say
this

with
sudden
boldness

from

Mother
and
I
have
get
a
poor
one

but
that
be
well
than
this
with
all
these
people
here
;
and
why
not
come
there
,
till
he
be
have
time

look
about

the

,
in
the
relief
of
have
make
his
proposition
,
find
his
tongue
loosen
,
and
speak
out
in
its
favour
with
his
utmost
eloquence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
"
say
the
boy
,
"
that
it
be
very
small
and
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
but
it
be
very
clean
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
think
it
would
be
noisy
,
but
there
be
not
a
quieter
court
than
our
in
all
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
afraid
of
the
child
;
the
baby
hardly
ever
cry
,
and
the
other
one
be
very
good

<EOS>
besides
,
I
would
mind
'em

<EOS>
They
would
not

you
much

,
I
be
sure

Miss
Nell
,
do
try

the
little
front

up

very
pleasant

<EOS>
You
can
see
a
piece
of
the
church
-
clock
,
through
the
chimney
,
and
almost
tell
the
time
;
mother
say
it
would
be
just
the
thing
for
you
,
and
so
it
would
,
<EOS>
and
you
would
have
her
to
wait
upon
you
both
,
and
me
to
run
of
errand
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
mean
money
,
bless
you
;
you
be
not
to
think
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
Will
you
try
him
,
Miss
Nell
?
 
<EOS>
only
say
you
will
try
him
.
 
<EOS>
do
try
to
make
old
master
come
,
and
ask
him
first
what
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
only
promise
that
,
Miss
Nell
?
"
  
<EOS>
before
the
child
could
reply
to
this
earnest
solicitation
,
the
street
-
door
open
,
and
Mr
Brass
thrust
out
his
night
-
cap
head
call
in
a
surly
voice
,
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
!
"
 
<EOS>
kit
immediately
glide
away
,
and
Nell
,
close
the
window
softly
,
draw
back
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
before
Mr
Brass
have
repeat
his
inquiry
many
time
,
Mr
Quilp
,
also
embellish
with
a
night
-
cap
,
emerge
from
the
same
door
and
look
carefully
up
and
down
the
street
,
and
up
at
all
the
window
of
the
house
,
from
the
opposite
side
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
there
be
nobody
in
sight
,
he
presently
return
into
the
house
with
his
legal
friend
,
protest
(
as
the
child
hear
from
the
staircase
)
,
that
there
be
a
league
and
plot
against
him
;
that
he
be
in
danger
of
be
rob
and
plunder
by
a
band
of
conspirator
who
prowl
about
the
house
at
all
season
;
and
that
he
would
delay
no
longer
but
take
immediate
step
for
dispose
of
the
property
and
return
to
his
own
peaceful
roof
.
 
<EOS>
have
growl
forth
these
,
and
a
great
many
other
threat
of
the
same
nature
,
he
coil
himself
once
more
in
the
child
's
little
bed
,
and
Nell
creep
softly
up
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
natural
enough
that
her
short
and
unfinished
dialogue
with
kit
should
leave
a
strong
impression
on
her
mind
,
and
influence
her
dream
that
night
and
her
recollection
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
<EOS>
surround
by
unfeele
creditor
,
and
mercenary
attendant
upon
the
sick
,
and
meeting
in
the
height
of
her
anxiety
and
sorrow
with
little
regard
or
sympathy
even
from
the
woman
about
her
,
it
be
not
surprising
that
the
affectionate
heart
of
the
child
should
have
be
touch
to
the
quick
by
one
kind
and
generous
spirit
,
however
uncouth
the
temple
in
which
it
dwelt
.
 
<EOS>
thank
Heaven
that
the
temple
of
such
spirit
be
not
make
with
hand
,
and
that
they
may
be
even
more
worthily
hung
with
poor
patch
-
work
than
with
purple
and
fine
linen
!

chapter
12
    
at
length
,
the
crisis
of
the
old
man
's
disorder
be
past
,
and
he
begin
to
mend
.
 
<EOS>
by
very
slow
and
feeble
degree
his
consciousness
come
back
;
but
the
mind
be
weaken
and
its
function
be
impair
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
patient
,
and
quiet
;
often
sit
brood
,
but
not
despondently
,
for
a
long
space
;
be
easily
amuse
,
even
by
a
sun
-
beam
on
the
wall
or
ceiling
;
make
no
complaint
that
the
day
be
long
,
or
the
night
tedious
;
and
appear
indeed
to
have
lose
all
count
of
time
,
and
every
sense
of
care
or
weariness
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sit
,
for
hour
together
,
with
Nell
's
small
hand
in
his
,
play
with
the
finger
and
stop
sometimes
to
smooth
her
hair
or
kiss
her
brow
;
and
,
when
he
see
that
tear
be
glisten
in
her
eye
,
would
look
,
amazed
,
about
him
for
the
cause
,
and
forget
his
wonder
even
while
he
look
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
and
he
ride
out
;
the
old
man
prop
up
with
pillow
,
and
the
child
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
hand
in
hand
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
and
motion
in
the
street
fatigue
his
brain
at
first
,
but
he
be
not
surprised
,
or
curious
,
or
pleased
,
or
irritated
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
ask
if
he
remember
this
,
or
that
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
quite
well
---
why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
turn
his
head
,
and
look
,
with
earnest
gaze
and
outstretche
neck
,
after
some
stranger
in
the
crowd
,
until
he
disappear
from
sight
;
but
,
to
the
question
why
he
do
this
,
he
answer
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
sit
in
his
easy
chair
one
day
,
and
Nell
upon
a
stool
beside
him
,
when
a
man
outside
the
door
inquire
if
he
may
enter
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
without
emotion
,
"
it
be
Quilp
,
he
know
.
 
<EOS>
Quilp
be
master
there
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
may
come
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
well
again
at
last

"
say
the
dwarf

down
opposite
him

<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
strong
now

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

feebly

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do

the
dwarf

raise
his
voice
,
for
the
old
man
's
sense
be
dull
than
they
have
be
;

but
,
as
soon
as
you
can
arrange
your
future

the

"
  
<EOS>
"
surely

You

Quilp
after
a
short
pause
,
"
the
good

this

would
be
uncomfortable
;
uninhabitable
in
fact

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
true

"
return
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Nell
too
,
what
would
she
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
,
"
bawl
the
dwarf
nod
his
head
;
"
that
be
very
well
observe

<EOS>
then
will
you
consider
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will

reply
the
old

.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
stop
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
suppose
,

the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sell
the

<EOS>
They
have
not
yield
quite
as
much
as
they

pretty
well
---
pretty
well

<EOS>
to

day
's
Tuesday

<EOS>
when
shall
they
be
move
?
 
<EOS>
there

no

shall
we

this
afternoon
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
Friday

"
return
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
be
it
---
with
the
understanding
that
I
can
not
go
beyond
that
day
,
neighbour
,
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
,
"
return
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remember
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Quilp
seem
rather
puzzle
by
the
strange
,
even
spiritless
way
in
which
all
this
be
say
;
but
as
the
old
man
nod
his
head
and
repeat
"
on
Friday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
it
,
"
he
have
no
excuse
for
dwell
on
the
subject
any
further
,
and
so
take
a
friendly
leave
with
many
expression
of
good
-
will
and
many
compliment
to
his
friend
on
his
look
so
remarkably
well
;
and
go
below
stair
to
report
progress
to
Mr
Brass
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
day
,
and
all
the
next
,
the
old
man
remain
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
He
wander
up
and
down
the
house
and
into
and
out
of
the
various
room
,
as
if
with
some
vague
intent
of
bid
them
adieu
,
but
he
refer
neither
by
direct
allusion
nor
in
any
other
manner
to
the
interview
of
the
morning
or
the
necessity
of
find
some
other
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
an
indistinct
idea
he
have
,
that
the
child
be
desolate
and
in
want
of
help
;
for
he
often
draw
her
to
his
bosom
and
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
,
say
that
they
would
not
desert
each
other
;
but
he
seem
unable
to
contemplate
their
real
position
more
distinctly
,
and
be
still
the
listless
,
passionless
creature
that
suffering
of
mind
and
body
have
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
call
this
a
state
of
childishness
,
but
it
be
the
same
poor
hollow
mockery
of
it
,
that
death
be
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
where
,
in
the
dull
eye
of
doate
man
,
be
the
laugh
light
and
life
of
childhood
,
the
gaiety
that
have
know
no
check
,
the
frankness
that
have
feel
no
chill
,
the
hope
that
have
never
wither
,
the
joy
that
fade
in
blossoming
?
 
<EOS>
where
,
in
the
sharp
lineament
of
rigid
and
unsightly
death
,
be
the
calm
beauty
of
slumber
,
tell
of
rest
for
the
wake
hour
that
be
past
,
and
gentle
hope
and
love
for
those
which
be
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
Lay
death
and
sleep
down
,
side
by
side
,
and
say
who
shall
find
the
two
akin
.
 
<EOS>
send
forth
the
child
and
childish
man
together
,
and
blush
for
the
pride
that
libel
our
own
old
happy
state
,
and
give
its
title
to
an
ugly
and
distorted
image
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
arrive
,
and
there
be
no
alteration
in
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
change
come
upon
him
that
evening
as
he
and
the
child
sit
silently
together
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
small
dull
yard
below
his
window
,
there
be
a
tree
---
green
and
flourish
enough
,
for
such
a
place
---
and
as
the
air
stir
among
its
leave
,
it
throw
a
ripple
shadow
on
the
white
wall
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
sit
watch
the
shadow
as
they
tremble
in
this
patch
of
light
,
until
the
sun
go
down
;
and
when
it
be
night
,
and
the
moon
be
slowly
rise
,
he
still
sit
in
the
same
spot
.
  
<EOS>
to
one
who
have
be
toss
on
a
restless
bed
so
long
,
even
these
few
green
leave
and
this
tranquil
light
,
although
it
languish
among
chimney
and
house
-
top
,
be
pleasant
thing
.
 
<EOS>
They
suggest
quiet
place
afar
off
,
and
rest
,
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
think
,
more
than
once
that
he
be
move
:
and
have
forborne
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
he
shed
tear
---
tear
that
it
lighten
her
ache
heart
to
see
---
and
make
as
though
he
would
fall
upon
his
knee
,
besought
her
to
forgive
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
forgive
you
---
what
?
"
<EOS>
say
Nell
,
interpose
to
prevent
his
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
grandfather
,
what
should
I
forgive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
that
be
past
,
all
that
have
come
upon
thee

Nell

all
that

in
that
uneasy
dream

"
return
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
so
,
"
say
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not

<EOS>
let
us
speak
of
something
else

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

yes

we
will

he
rejoin
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
it
shall
be

<EOS>
Hush

<EOS>
for
if
they

down
stair

they
would
cry
that
I

.
 
<EOS>
We

We

earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
us

barefoot
through
the
world

rather
than
linger
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
,
"
answer
the
old
man
,
"
we
will
travel
afoot
through
the
field

and
trust
ourselves
to
God

<EOS>
It
be
far
well
to
lie
down
at
night
beneath
an
open
sky
like
that
yonder

<EOS>
see
how
bright
it
be

than
to
rest
in
close
room
which
be
always
full
of
care
and
weary
dream

<EOS>
Thou
and
I

may
be
cheerful
and
happy
yet
,
and
learn
to
forget
this

<EOS>
"
We
will
be
happy

cry
the
child

<EOS>
"
We

<EOS>
"

rejoin
the

<EOS>
"
let
us
steal
away
to

morrow
morning

early
and
softly
,
that
we

not
be

leave
no

<EOS>
Poor
Nell
!
 
<EOS>
Thy
cheek
be
pale
,
and
thy
eye
be
heavy
with
watch
and
weep
for
me
---
I
know

for
me
;
but
thou
wilt
be
well
again
,
and
merry
too
,
when

far
away

<EOS>
to
-
morrow
morning
,
dear

we
will
turn
our
face
from
this
scene
of
sorrow
,
and
be
as
free
and
happy
as
the
bird
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
old
man
clasp
his
hand
above
her
head
,
and
say
,
in
a
few
break
word
,
that
from
that
time
forth
they
would
wander
up
and
down
together
,
and
never
part
more
until
Death
take
one
or
other
of
the
twain
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
's
heart
beat
high
with
hope
and
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
thought
of
hunger
,
or
cold
,
or
thirst
,
or
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
in
this
,
but
a
return
of
the
simple
pleasure
they
have
once
enjoy
,
a
relief
from
the
gloomy
solitude
in
which
she
have
live
,
an
escape
from
the
heartless
people
by
whom
she
have
be
surround
in
her
late
time
of
trial
,
the
restoration
of
the
old
man
's
health
and
peace
,
and
a
life
of
tranquil
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Sun
,
and
stream
,
and
meadow
,
and
summer
day
,
shine
brightly
in
her
view
,
and
there
be
no
dark
tint
in
all
the
sparkling
picture
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
have
sleep
,
for
some
hour
,
soundly
in
his
bed
,
and
she
be
yet
busily
engage
in
prepare
for
their
flight
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
article
of
clothing
for
herself
to
carry
,
and
a
few
for
him
;
old
garment
,
such
as
become
their
fall
fortune
,
lay
out
to
wear
;
and
a
staff
to
support
his
feeble
step
,
put
ready
for
his
use
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
her
task
;
for
now
she
must
visit
the
old
room
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
and
how
different
the
parting
with
them
be
,
from
any
she
have
expect
,
and
most
of
all
from
that
which
she
have
oftenest
picture
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
ever
have
think
of
bid
them
farewell
in
triumph
,
when
the
recollection
of
the
many
hour
she
have
pass
among
them
rise
to
her
swell
heart
,
and
make
her
feel
the
wish
a
cruelty
:
lonely
and
sad
though
many
of
those
hour
have
be
!
 
<EOS>
She
sit
down
at
the
window
where
she
have
spend
so
many
evening
---
darker
far
than
this
---
and
every
thought
of
hope
or
cheerfulness
that
have
occur
to
her
in
that
place
come
vividly
upon
her
mind
,
and
blot
out
all
its
dull
and
mournful
association
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
Her
own
little
room
too
,
where
she
have
so
often
kneel
down
and
pray
at
night
---
pray
for
the
time
which
she
hope
be
dawn
now
---
the
little
room
where
she
have
sleep
so
peacefully
,
and
dream
such
pleasant
dream
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
not
to
be
able
to
glance
<EOS>
round
it
once
more
,
and
to
be
force
to
leave
it
without
one
kind
look
or
grateful
tear
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
trifle
there
---
poor
useless
thing
---
that
she
would
have
like
to
take
away
;
but
that
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
this
brought
to
mind
her
bird
,
her
poor
bird
,
who
hang
there
yet
.
<EOS>
She
weep
bitterly
for
the
loss
of
this
little
creature
---
until
the
idea
occur
to
her
<EOS>
---
she
do
not
know
how
,
or
why
,
it
come
into
her
head
---
<EOS>
that
it
may
,
by
some
mean
,
fall
into
the
hand
of
kit
who
would
keep
it
for
her
sake
,
and
think
,
perhaps
,
that
she
have
leave
it
behind
in
the
hope
that
he
may
have
it
,
and
as
an
assurance
that
she
be
grateful
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
calm
and
comfort
by
the
thought
,
and
go
to
rest
with
a
light
heart
.
  
<EOS>
from
many
dream
of
ramble
through
light
and
sunny
place
,
but
with
some
vague
object
unattained
which
run
indistinctly
through
them
all
,
she
awake
to
find
that
it
be
yet
night
,
and
that
the
star
be
shine
brightly
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
day
begin
to
glimmer
,
and
the
star
to
grow
pale
and
dim
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
sure
of
this
,
she
arise
,
and
dress
herself
for
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
yet
asleep
,
and
as
she
be
unwilling
to
disturb
him
,
she
leave
him
to
slumber
on
,
until
the
sun
rise
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
that
they
should
leave
the
house
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
,
and
be
soon
ready
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
then
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
they
tread
lightly
and
cautiously
down
the
stair
,
tremble
whenever
a
board
creak
,
and
often
stop
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
have
forget
a
kind
of
wallet
which
contain
the
light
burden
he
have
to
carry
;
and
the
go
back
a
few
step
to
fetch
it
seem
an
interminable
delay
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
they
reach
the
passage
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
the
snoring
of
Mr
Quilp
and
his
legal
friend
sound
more
terrible
in
their
ear
than
the
roar
of
lion
.
 
<EOS>
the
bolt
of
the
door
be
rusty
,
and
difficult
to
unfasten
without
noise
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
all
draw
back
,
it
be
find
to
be
lock
,
and
bad
of
all
,
the
key
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
child
remember
,
for
the
first
time
,
one
of
the
nurse
have
tell
her
that
Quilp
always
lock
both
the
house
-
door
at
night
,
and
keep
the
key
on
the
table
in
his
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
great
fear
and
trepidation
that
little
Nell
slip
off
her
shoe
and
glide
through
the
store
-
room
of
old
curiosity
,
where
Mr
Brass
---
the
ugly
piece
of
good
in
all
the
stock
---
lie
sleep
on
a
mattress
,
pass
into
her
own
little
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
here
she
stand
,
for
a
few
moment
,
quite
transfix
with
terror
at
the
sight
of
Mr
Quilp
,
who
be
hang
so
far
out
of
bed
that
he
almost
seem
to
be
stand
on
his
head
,
and
who
,
either
from
the
uneasiness
of
this
posture
,
or
in
one
of
his
agreeable
habit
,
be
gasp
and
growl
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
the
white
(
or
rather
the
dirty
yellow
)
of
his
eye
distinctly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
time
,
however
,
to
ask
whether
anything
ail
him
;
so
,
possess
herself
of
the
key
after
one
hasty
glance
about
the
room
,
and
repasse
the
prostrate
Mr
Brass
<EOS>
,
she
rejoin
the
old
man
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
the
door
open
without
noise
,
and
pass
into
the
street
,
stand
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
way
?
"
say
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
look
,
irresolutely
and
helplessly
,
first
at
her
,
then
to
the
right
and
leave
,
then
at
her
again
,
and
shake
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
she
be
thenceforth
his
guide
and
leader
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
feel
it
,
but
have
no
doubt
or
misgive
,
and
put
her
hand
in
his
,
lead
him
gently
away
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
beginning
of
a
day
in
June
;
the
deep
blue
sky
unsullie
by
a
cloud
,
and
teem
with
brilliant
light
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
,
as
yet
,
nearly
free
from
passenger
,
the
house
and
shop
be
closed
,
and
the
healthy
air
of
morning
fall
like
breath
from
angel
,
on
the
sleeping
town
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
and
the
child
pass
on
through
the
glad
silence
,
elate
with
hope
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
alone
together
,
once
again
;
every
object
be
bright
and
fresh
;
nothing
remind
them
,
otherwise
than
by
contrast
,
of
the
monotony
and
constraint
they
have
leave
behind
;
church
tower
and
steeple
,
frowning
and
dark
at
other
time
,
now
shine
in
the
sun
;
each
humble
nook
and
corner
rejoice
in
light
;
and
the
sky
,
dim
only
by
excessive
distance
,
shed
its
placid
smile
on
everything
beneath
.
  
<EOS>
forth
from
the
city
,
while
it
yet
slumber
,
go
the
two
poor
adventurer
,
wander
they
know
not
whither
.

one
of

Majesty
's
attornie
of

Courts
of
the
King
's
Bench
and
Common
Pleas
at
Westminster
and
a
solicitor
of
the
High
Court
of
Chancery
,
slumber
on
,
unconscious
and
unsuspicious
of
any
mischance
,
until
a
knocking
on
the
street
door
,
often
repeat
and
gradually
mount
up
from
a
modest
single
rap
to
a
perfect
battery
of
knock
,
fire
in
long
discharge
with
a
very
short
interval
between
,
cause
the
say
Daniel
Quilp
to
struggle
into
a
horizontal
position
,
and
to
stare
at
the
ceiling
with
a
drowsy
indifference
,
betoken
that
he
hear
the
noise
and
rather
wonder
at
the
same
,
and
could
not
be
at
the
trouble
of
bestow
any
further
thought
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
knocking
,
however
,
instead
of
accommodate
itself
to
his
lazy
state
,
increase
in
vigour
and
become
more
importunate
,
as
if
in
earnest
remonstrance
against
his
fall
asleep
again
,
now
that
he
have
once
open
his
eye
,
Daniel
Quilp
begin
by
degree
to
comprehend
the
possibility
of
there
be
somebody
at
the
door
;
and
thus
he
gradually
come
to
recollect
that
it
be
Friday
morning
,
and
he
have
order
Mrs
Quilp
to
be
in
wait
upon
him
at
an
early
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Brass
,
after
writhe
about
,
in
a
great
many
strange
attitude
,
and
often
twist
his
face
and
eye
into
an
expression
like
that
which
be
usually
produce
by
eat
gooseberry
very
early
in
the
season
,
be
by
this
time
awake
also
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
Mr
Quilp
invest
himself
in
his
every
-
day
garment
,
he
hasten
to
do
the
like
,
put
on
his
shoe
before
his
stocking
,
and
thrust
his
leg
into
his
coat
sleeve
,
and
make
such
other
small
mistake
in
his
toilet
as
be
not
uncommon
to
those
who
dress
in
a
hurry
,
and
labour
under
the
agitation
of
have
be
suddenly
rouse
.
<EOS>
while
the
attorney
be
thus
engage
,
the
dwarf
be
grope
under
the
table
,
mutter
desperate
imprecation
on
himself
,
and
mankind
in
general
,
and
all
inanimate
object
to
boot
,
which
suggest
to
Mr
Brass
the
question
<EOS>
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
key
,
"
say
the
dwarf
,
look
viciously
about
him
,
"
the
door
-
key
<EOS>
---
that
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
d'ye
know
anything
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
know
anything
of
it
,
sir
?
"
return
Mr
Brass
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
you
?
"
repeat
Quilp
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
nice
lawyer
,
an't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Ugh
,
you
idiot
!
"
  
<EOS>
not
care
to
represent
to
the
dwarf
in
his
present
humour
,
that
the
loss
of
a
key
by
another
person
could
scarcely
be
say
to
affect
his
(
Brass
's
)
legal
knowledge
in
any
material
degree
,
Mr
Brass
humbly
suggest
that
it
must
have
be
forget
over
night
,
and
be
,
doubtless
,
at
that
moment
in
its
native
key
-
hole
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
that
Mr
Quilp
have
a
strong
conviction
to
the
contrary
,
found
on
his
recollection
of
have
carefully
take
it
out
,
he
be
fain
to
admit
that
this
be
possible
,
and
therefore
go
grumble
to
the
door
where
,
sure
enough
,
he
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
just
as
Mr
Quilp
lay
his
hand
upon
the
lock
,
and
see
with
great
astonishment
that
the
fastening
be
undo
,
the
knocking
come
again
with
the
most
irritating
violence
,
and
the
daylight
which
have
be
shine
through
the
key
-
hole
be
intercept
on
the
outside
by
a
human
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
dwarf
be
very
much
exasperate
,
and
want
somebody
to
wreak
his
ill
-
humour
upon
,
determine
to
dart
out
suddenly
,
and
favour
Mrs
Quilp
with
a
gentle
acknowledgment
of
her
attention
in
make
that
hideous
uproar
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
draw
back
the
lock
very
silently
and
softly
,
and
open
the
door
all

furtively
at
him

to
Mr

observe
,
with
assumed
carelessness

that
this
need
not

with
the
removal
of

<EOS>
"
for
indeed

"
he
add
,
"
we
know
that

not

up

be
not

in
great
bewilderment

<EOS>
"
keep
his

retirement
very
close

that
he

not

too
often

affectionate

devoted
friend

"
add
the
dwarf
,
rub
his
hand
hard
;
"
I
say
nothing

but
be
that
your
meaning

"
  
<EOS>
Richard
Swiveller
be
utterly
aghast
at
this
unexpected
alteration
of
circumstance
,
which
threaten
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
project
in
which
he
bear
so
conspicuous
a
part
,
and
seem
to
nip
his
prospect
in
the
bud
.
 
<EOS>
have
only
receive
from
Frederick
Trent
,
late
on
the
previous
night
,
information
of
the
old
man
's
illness
,
he
have
come
upon
a
visit
of
condolence
and
inquiry
to
Nell
,
prepare
with
the
first
instalment
of
that
long
train
of
fascination
which
be
to
fire
her
heart
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
,
when
he
have
be
think
of
all
kind
of
graceful
and
insinuating
approach
,
and
meditate
on
the
fearful
retaliation
which
be
slowly
work
against
Sophy
Wackles
---
here
be
Nell
,
the
old
man
,
and
all
the
money
go
,
melt
away
,
<EOS>
decamp
he
know
not
whither
,
as
if
with
a
fore
-
knowledge
of
the
scheme
and
a
resolution
to
defeat
it
in
the
very
outset
,
before
a
step
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
secret
heart
,
Daniel
Quilp
be
both
surprised
and
trouble
by
the
flight
which
have
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
escape
his
keen
eye
that
some
indispensable
article
of
clothing
be
go
with
the
fugitive
,
and
know
the
old
man
's
weak
state
of
mind
,
he
marvel
what
that
course
of
proceeding
may
be
in
which
he
have
so
readily
procure
the
concurrence
of
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
(
or
it
would
be
a
gross
injustice
to
Mr
Quilp
)
<EOS>
that
he
be
torture
by
any
disinterested
anxiety
on
behalf
of
either
.
 
<EOS>
His
uneasiness
arise
from
a
misgiving
that
the
old
man
have
some
secret
store
of
money
which
he
have
not
suspect
;
and
the
idea
of
its
escape
his
clutch
,
overwhelm
him
with
mortification
and
self
-
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
frame
of
mind
,
it
be
some
consolation
to
him
to
find
that
Richard
Swiveller
be
,
for
different
reason
,
evidently
irritated
and
disappoint
by
the
same
cause
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
,
think
the
dwarf
,
that
he
have
come
there
,
on
behalf
of
his
friend
,
to
cajole
or
frighten
the
old
man
out
of
some
small
fraction
of
that
wealth
of
which
they
suppose
him
to
have
an
abundance
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
it
be
a
relief
to
vex
his
heart
with
a
picture
of
the
rich
the
old
man
hoard
,
and
to
expatiate
on
his
cunning
in
remove
himself
even
beyond
the
reach
of
importunity
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Dick
,
with
a
blank
look
,
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
of
no
use
my
staying
here

"
  
<EOS>
"
not

in
the
world

the
dwarf

<EOS>
"
You
will
mention
that

Dick

he
certainly
would

very
first

Mr

It

observe

justice

nothing
genteel

they
have
penetrate
very
far
into
the
labyrinth
of
man

abode
which
yet
lie
between
them
and
the
outskirt
,
this
aspect
begin
to
melt
away
,
and
noise
and
bustle
to
usurp
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
some
straggle
cart
and
coach
rumble
by
,
first
break
the
charm
,
then
other
come
,
then
other
yet
more
active
,
then
a
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
the
wonder
be
,
at
first
,
to
see
a
tradesman
's
window
open
,
but
it
be
a
rare
thing
soon
to
see
one
closed
;
then
,
smoke
rise
slowly
from
the
chimney
,
and
sash
be
throw
up
to
let
in
air
,
and
door
be
open
,
and
<EOS>
servant

,
look
lazily
in
all
direction
but
their
broom
,
scatter
brown
cloud
of
dust
into
the
eye
of
shrink
passenger
,
or
listen
disconsolately
to
milkman
who
speak
of
country
fair
,
and
tell
of
waggon
in
the
mews
,
with
awning
and
all
thing
complete
,
and
gallant
swain
to
boot
,
which
another
hour
would
see
upon
their
journey
.
  
<EOS>
this
quarter
pass
,
they
come
upon
the
haunt
of
commerce
and
great
traffic
,
where
many
people
be
resort
,
and
business
be
already
rife
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
look
about
him
with
a
startled
and
bewilder
gaze
,
for
these
<EOS>
be
place
that
he
hope
to
shun
.
 
<EOS>
He
press
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
and
draw
the
child
along
by
narrow
court
and
wind
way
,
nor
do
he
seem
at
ease
until
they
have
leave
it
far
behind
,
often
cast
a
backward
look
towards
it
,
murmur
that
ruin
and
self
-
murder
be
crouch
in
every
street
,
and
would
follow
if
they
scent
them
;
and
that
they
could
not
fly
too
fast
.
  
<EOS>
again
this
quarter
pass
,
they
come
upon
a
straggle
neighbourhood
,
where
the
mean
house
parcel
off
in
room
,
and
window
patch
with
rag
and
paper
,
tell
of
the
populous
poverty
that
shelter
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
shop
sell
good
that
only
poverty
could
buy
,
and
seller
and
buyer
be
pinch
and
gripe
alike
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
poor
street
where
fade
gentility
essay
with
scanty
space
and
shipwreck
mean
to
make
its
last
feeble
stand
,
but
tax

gatherer
and
creditor
come
there
as
elsewhere
,
and
the
poverty
that
yet
faintly
struggle
be
hardly
less
squalid
and
manifest
than
that
which
have
long
ago
submit
and
give
up
the
game
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a

wide

for
the
humble
follower
of
the
camp
of

pitch
their

round
about

for
many
a

but
its

be
still
the

<EOS>
Damp

<EOS>
at

with

innocent

solitarily

very
glad

<EOS>
the

repeat
her
artless
prayer
once
that
morning
,
more
earnestly
perhaps
than
she

the

there

there

lave

cool
her

before
set
forth
to
walk
again

<EOS>
She
would
have
the
old

refresh
himself
in
this
way
too

and
make
him
sit
down
upon
the
grass
,
cast
the
water
on
him
with
her
hand

dry
it
with

"
I

He
lay
his

upon

moan
piteously

<EOS>
the
time
have
be
,
and
a
very
few
day
before
,
when
the
child
could
not
have
restrain
her
tear
and
must
have
weep
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
she
soothe
him
with
gentle
and
tender
word
,
smile
at
his
thinking
they
could
ever
part
,
and
rally
him
cheerfully
upon
the
jest
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
soon
calm
and
fall
asleep
,
singe
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
,
like
a
little
child

He
awake
refresh

<EOS>
the
road
be
pleasant
,
lie
between
beautiful
pasture
and
field
of
corn
,
about
which

poise
high

the
clear
blue
sky

the
lark
trill
out
her
happy
song

<EOS>
the
air
come
laden
with
the
fragrance
it
catch
upon
its
way
,
and
the
bee

upborne
upon
its
scented
breath

hum
forth
their
drowsy
satisfaction
as
they
float
by

<EOS>
They
be
now
in
the
open
country
;
the
house
be
very
few
and
scatter
at
long
interval
,
often
mile
apart
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
they
come
upon
a
cluster
of
poor
cottage
,
some
with
a
chair
or
low
board
put
across
the
open
door
to
keep
the
scramble
child
from

other
shut
up
close
while
all
the

be
work
in

field

<EOS>
these
be
often
the
commencement
of
a
little
village
:
and
after
an
interval
come
a
wheelwright
's
shed
or
perhaps
a
blacksmith
's
forge
;
then
a
thriving
farm
with
sleepy
cow
lie
about
the
yard
,
and
horse
peer
over
the
low
wall
and
scamper
away
when
harness
horse
pass
upon
the
road
,
as
though
in
triumph
at
their
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
dull
pig
too
,
turn
up
the
ground
in
search
of
dainty
food
,
and
grunt
their
monotonous
grumbling
as
they
prowl
about
,
or
cross
each
other
in
their
quest
;
plump
pigeon
skim
round
the
roof
or
strut
on
the
eave
;
and
duck
and
goose
,
far
more
graceful
in
their
own
conceit
,
waddle
awkwardly
about
the
edge
of
the
pond
or
sailing
glibly
on
its
surface
.
 
<EOS>
the
farm

yard
pass
,
then
come
the
little
inn
;
the
humbler
beer

shop
;
and
the
village
tradesman

;
then
the
lawyer
's
and
the
parson

,
at
whose
dread
name
the
beer

shop
tremble
;
the
church
then
peep
out
modestly
from
a
clump
of
tree
;
then
there
be
a

more
cottage

then
the

and
pound
,
and
not
unfrequently
,
on
a
bank
by
the
way

side
,
<EOS>
a
deep
old
dusty
well
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
trim

hedge
field
on
either
hand
,
and
the
open
road
again
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
all
day
,
and
sleep
that
night
at
a
small
cottage
where
bed
be
let
to
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
they
be
afoot
again
,
and
though
jade
at
first
,
and
very
tired
,
recover
before
long
and
proceed
briskly
forward
.
  
<EOS>
They
often
stop
to
rest
,
but
only
for
a
short
space
at
a
time
,
and
still
keep
on
,
have
have
but
slight
refreshment
since
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
five
o'clock
in

when
draw
near
another
cluster
of

wistfully
in
each
,
doubtful
at
which
to
ask
for
permission
to
rest
awhile
,
and
buy
a
draught
of
milk
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
determine

for

timid

fearful

<EOS>
here
be
a
cry
child

there
a
noisy
wife

<EOS>
in
this

the
people
seem
too
poor

in

too
many

<EOS>
at
length
she
stop
at
one
where
the
family
be
seat
round
the
table
---
chiefly
because
there
be
an
old
man
sit
in
a
cushion
chair
beside
the
hearth
,
and
she
think
he
be
a

"

"

the

all

as

Mr

the
misanthrope

after
blow
away
at

intensely
wretched

take
his
station
on
one
side

put
his

all
question

remark
of

to
make
a
dismal

his
most
intimate
private
friend

the
full

a
merry

glorious
existence

that
he
be
at
all

under
every
circumstance
the

intelligent

joyful
person
that
the
spectator
then
beheld
him

<EOS>
all
this
Mr
Codlin
do
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
have
make
up
his
mind
for
the
bad
and
be
quite
resign
;
his
eye
slowly
wander
about
during
the
brisk
repartee
to
observe
the
effect
upon
the
audience
,
and
particularly
the
impression
make
upon
the
landlord
and
landlady
,
which
may
be
productive
of
very
important
result
in
connexion
with
the
supper
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
head
,
however
,
he
have
no
cause
for
any
anxiety

for
the
whole
performance
be
applaud
to
the
echo
,
and
voluntary
contribution
be
shower
in
with
a
liberality
which
testify
yet
more
strongly
to
the
general
delight
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
laughter
none
be
more
loud
and
frequent
than
the
old
man
's
.
 
<EOS>
Nell

be
unheard
,
for
she
,
poor
child
,
with
her
head
droop
on
his
shoulder
,
have
fall
asleep
,
and
sleep
too
soundly
to
be
rouse
by
any
of
his
effort
to
awaken
her
to
a
participation
in
his
glee
.
  
<EOS>
the
supper
be
very
good
,
but
she
be
too
tired
to
eat
,
and
yet
would
not
leave
the
old
man
until
she
have
kiss
him
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
He
,
happily
insensible
to
every
care
and
anxiety
,
sit
listen
with
a
vacant
smile
and
admire
face
to
all
that
his
new
friend
say
;
and
it
be
not
until
they
retire
yawn
to
their
room
,
that
he
follow
the
child
up
stair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
loft
partition
into
two
compartment
,
where
they
be
to
rest
,
but
they
be
well
pleased
with
their
lodging
and
have
hope
for
none
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
uneasy
when
he
have
lain
down
,
and
beg
that
Nell
would
come
and
sit
at
his
bedside
as
she
have
do
for
so
many
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
hasten
to
him
,
and
sit
there
till
he
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
window
,
hardly
more
than
a
chink
in
the
wall
,
in
her
room
,
and
when
she
leave
him
,
she
open
it
,
quite
wonder
at
the
silence
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
old
church
,
and
the
grave
about
it
in
the
moonlight
,
and
the
dark
tree
whisper
among
themselves
,
make
her
more
thoughtful
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
close
the
window
again
,
and
sit
down
upon
the
bed
,
thought
of
the
life
that
be
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
a
little
money
,
but
it
be
very
little
,
and
when
that
be
go
,
they
must
begin
to
beg
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
piece
of
gold
among
it
,
and
an
emergency
may
come
when
its
worth
to
them
would
be
increase
a
hundred
fold
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
good
to
hide
this
coin
,
and
never
produce
it
unless
their
case
be
absolutely
desperate
,
and
no
other
resource
be
leave
them
.
  
<EOS>
Her
resolution
take
,
she
sew
the
piece
of
gold
into
her
dress
,
and
go
to
bed
with
a
light
heart
sink
into
a
deep
slumber

another
bright
day
shine
in
through
the
small
casement
,
and
claim
fellowship
with
the
kindre
eye
of
the

,
awake
her

<EOS>
at
sight
of
the
strange
room

its
unaccustomed
object
she
start
up
in

how
she

from
the

all
that

trustful
.

It

she
walk
out
into
the

brush
the
dew
from
the
long
grass
with
her
foot
,
and
often
turn
aside
into
place
where
it
grow
long
than
in
other
,
that
she
may
not
tread
upon
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
a
curious
kind
of
pleasure
in
linger
among
these
house
of
the
dead
,
and
read
the
inscription
on
the
tomb
of
the
good
people
(
a
great
number
of
good

be
bury
there
)
,
pass
on
from
one

another
with
increase
interest

<EOS>
It
be
a
very
quiet
place
,
as
such
a
place
should
be
,
save
for
the
cawing
of
the
rook
who
have
build
their
nest
among
the
branch
of
some
tall
old
tree
,
and
be
call
to
one
another

high
up
in
the

<EOS>
first
,
one
sleek
bird
,
hover
near
his
ragged
house
as
it
swing
and
dangle
in
the
wind
,
utter
his
hoarse
cry
,
quite
by
chance
as
it
would
seem
,
and
in
a
sober
tone
as

another

he
call
again

louder

then
another

and
then

each
time

other

arrive
hastily
from
the
grey

turret
and

window
,
join
the
clamour
which
rise
and
fall
,
and
swell
and
drop
again
,
and
still
go
on
;
and
all
this
noisy
contention
amidst
a
skimming
to
and
fro
,
and
light
on
fresh
branch
,
and
frequent
change
of
place
,
which
satirise
the
old
restlessness
of
those
who
lie
so
still
beneath
the
moss
and
turf
below

and
the
strife
in
which

the

there

the

I

then
grow
garrulous
upon
a
theme
which

though
it
be

<EOS>
a

,
she
tell
her
how
she
have
weep
and
moan
and
pray
to
die
herself
,
when
this
happen
;
and
how
when
she
first
come
to
that
place
,
a
young

strong
in
love

grief
,
she
have
hope
that
her

be
break
as
it

but
that
time
pass
by

although
she
continue
to
be
sad
when
she
come
there
,
still
she
could
bear
to
come
,
and
so
go
on
until
it
be
pain
no
longer
,
but
a
solemn
pleasure
,
and
a
duty
she
have
learn
to
like

<EOS>
and
now
that
five

fifty
year

she
speak
of
the
dead
man
as
if
he
have
be
her
son
or
grandson
,
with
a
kind
of
pity
for
his
youth
,
grow
out
of
her
own
old
age
,
and
an
exalting
of
his
strength
and
manly
beauty
as
compare
with
her
own
weakness
and
decay
;
<EOS>
and
yet
she
speak
about
him
as
her
husband
too
,
and
think
of
herself
in
connexion
with
him
,
as
she
use
to
be

not
as
she
be
now
,
talk
of

the

leave
her
gather
the

with
the
prefatory

be
confer
upon

by
reason

<EOS>
Short
Trotters
however

inconvenient

the

short

then
,

Trotters

as
the

return
unto
the
remonstrance
of
his
friend
Mr
Thomas
Codlin
a
jocose
answer
calculate
to
turn
aside
his
discontent
;
and
apply
himself
with
great
relish
to
the
cold
boil
beef
,
the
tea
,
and
bread
and
butter
,
strongly
impressed
upon
his
companion
that
they
should
do
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Codlin
indeed
require
no
such
persuasion
,
as
he
have
already
eat
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
carry
and
be
now
moisten
his
clay
with
strong
ale
,
whereof
he
take
deep
draught
with
a
silent
relish
and
invite
nobody
to
partake

thus
again
strongly
indicate
his
misanthropical
turn
of
mind

<EOS>
Breakfast
be
at
length
over

Mr
Codlin
call
the
bill

and
charge
the

a

also
savour
of
misanthropy
)
divide
the
sum

total

assign
one

these

and

Mr

's
false

the
effect
it
work

spirit

strongly
illustrate
;
for
whereas
he
have
be
last
night
accost
by
Mr
Punch
as
"
master
,
"
and
have
by
inference
leave
the
audience
to
understand
that
he
maintain
that
individual

luxurious
entertainment

here

be

in

constant
fire

dark
box

with

up
round
his

<EOS>
Mr

trudge
heavily
on

when

a
blast
upon
the
brazen
trumpet
and
carol
a
fragment
of
a
song
in

hilarious
tone
common

Punches
and
their
consort

<EOS>
if
people
hurry
to
the
window

Mr

pitch
the
temple

and
hastily
unfurl
the
drapery
and
conceal
short
therewith
,
flourish
hysterically
on

sometimes

down

there

for

but
they
be
generally
well

and
seldom

They
make

Mr

They
have

Mr

his
deep
misanthropy
have
let
down
the
drapery

seat
himself
in
the
bottom
of
the
show
,
invisible
to
mortal
eye

disdainful

blow

Mr

follow
with
a
willing

soon
find
that

without
good
reason

<EOS>
a
mighty
fire
be
blaze
on
the
hearth
and
roar
up
the
wide
chimney
with
a
cheerful
sound
,
which
a
large
iron
cauldron

its
pleasant
aid

skip

up

off

more
rich

and
an
unctuous
steam

be
needful

the

<EOS>
Mr

draw
his

"
at

<EOS>
"
It

up

clock

a
colour
in

turn
at
twenty
-
two
minute
before
eleven

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Mr
Codlin
,
"
fetch
me
a
pint
of
warm
ale
,
and
do
not
let
nobody
bring
into
the
room
even
so
much
as
a
biscuit
till
the
time
arrive

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nod
his
approval
of
this
decisive
and
manly
course
of
procedure
,
the
landlord
retire
to
draw
the
beer
,
and
presently
return
with
it
,
apply
himself
to
warm
the
same
in
a
small
tin
vessel
shape
funnel

wise
,
for
the
convenience
of
stick
it
far
down
in
the
fire

get
at
the
bright
place
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
soon
do
,
and
he
hand
it
over
to
Mr
Codlin
with
that
creamy
froth
upon
the
surface
which
be
one
of
the
happy
circumstance
attendant
on
mulled
malt
.
  
<EOS>
greatly
soften
by
this
soothing
beverage
,
Mr
Codlin
now
bethink
him
of
his
companion
,
and
acquaint
mine
host
of
the
Sandboys
that
their
arrival
may
be
shortly
look
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
be
rattle
against
the
window
and
pour
down
in
torrent
,
and
such
be
Mr
Codlin
's
extreme
amiability
of
mind
,
that
he
more
than
once
express
his
earnest
hope
that
they
would
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
get
wet
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
they
arrive
,
drench
with
the
rain
and
present
a
most
miserable
appearance
,
notwithstanding
that
Short
have
shelter
the
child
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
skirt
of
his
own
coat
,
and
they
be
nearly
breathless
from
the
haste
they
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
step
be
no
sooner
hear
upon
the
road
than
the
landlord
,
who
have
be
at
the
outer
door
anxiously
watch
for
their
come

rush
into
the
kitchen
and
take
the
cover
off
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
be
electrical
.
<EOS>
They
all
come
in
with
smile
face
though
the
wet
be
drip
from
their
clothe
upon
the
floor
,
and
Short
's
first
remark
be
,
"
what
a
delicious
smell
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
difficult
to
forget
rain
and
mud
by
the
side
of
a
cheerful
fire
,
and
in
a
bright
room
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
furnish
with
slipper
and
such
dry
garment
as
the
house
or
their

bundle
afford
,
and
ensconce
themselves
,
as
Mr
Codlin
have
already
do
,
in
the
warm
chimney

corner
,
soon
forgot
their
late
trouble
or
only
remember
them
as
enhance
the
delight
of
the
present
time

<EOS>
overpower
by
the
warmth
and
comfort
and
the
fatigue
they
have
undergo

nelly
and
the
old

have
not
long
take
their
seat
here

when

fall
asleep

<EOS>
"

retort
his

It

do

I

there

have
you

mutter
Thomas

<EOS>

this

<EOS>
"
He
have
give
his

the
slip

<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
what
I
say

he
have
give
his

<EOS>
"
YOU'RE
not

<EOS>
cry
Mr
Codlin
,
glance
at
the
clock
again
and
pull
his
hair
with
both
hand
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
,
but
whether
occasion
by
his
companion
's
observation
or
the
tardy
pace
of
Time
,
it
be
difficult
to
determine
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
world
to

in

<EOS>
"
I
,
"
repeat
Short
emphatically

slowly
,
"
be

<EOS>
I

a
falling
into
bad

among
people
that

<EOS>
therefore
when
they
dewelope
an
intention

company
from

I
shall
take
measure
for
detain
of
'em
,
and
restore
'em
to
their
friend

who
I
dare

have
have

paste
up

with

have
be
shake
himself
impatiently
from
side
to
side
up
to
this
point
and
occasionally
stamp
on
the
ground
,
but
who
now
look
up
with
eager
eye
;
"
it
be
possible
that
there
may
be
uncommon
good
sense
in
what
you
have
say

<EOS>
if
there

there
should
be
a
reward

short
,
remember
that
we

partner

everything

"
  
<EOS>
His
companion
have
only
time
to
nod
a
brief
assent
to
this
position
,
for
the
child
awake
at
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
draw
close
together
during
the
previous
whispering
,
and
now
hastily
separate
and
be
rather
awkwardly
endeavour
to
exchange
some
casual
remark
in
their
usual
tone
,
when
strange
footstep
be
hear
without
,
and
fresh
company
enter
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
no
other
than
four
very
dismal
dog
,
who
come
patter
in
one
after
the
other
,
head
by
an
old
bandy
dog
of
particularly
mournful
aspect
,
who
,
stop
when
the
last
of
his
follower
have
get
as
far
as
the
door
,
erect
himself
upon
his
hind
leg
and
look
round
at
his
companion
,
who
immediately
stand
upon
their
hind
leg
,
in
a
grave
and
melancholy
row
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
only
remarkable
circumstance
about
these
dog
,
for
each
of
them
wear
a
kind
of
little
coat
of
some
gaudy
colour
trim
with
tarnished
spangle
,
and
one
of
them
have
a
cap
upon
his
head
,
tie
very
carefully
under
his
chin
,
which
have
fall
down
upon
his
nose
and
completely
obscure
one
eye
;
add
to
this
,
that
the
gaudy
coat
be
all
wet
through
and
discolour
with
rain
,
and
that
the
wearer
be
splash
and
dirty
,
and
some
idea
may
be
form
of
the
unusual
appearance
of
these
new
visitor
to
the
Jolly
Sandboys
.
  
<EOS>
neither
Short
nor
the
landlord
nor
Thomas
Codlin
,
however
,
be
in
the
least
surprised
,
merely
remark
that
these
be
Jerry
's
dog
and
that
Jerry
could
not
be
far
behind
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
the
dog
stand
,
patiently
wink
and
gape
and
look
extremely
hard
at
the
boiling
pot
,
until
Jerry
himself
appear
,
when
they
all
drop
down
at
once
and
walk
about
the
room
in
their
natural
manner
.
<EOS>
this
posture
it
must
be
confess
do
not
much
improve
their
appearance
,
as
their
own
personal
tail
and
their
coat
tail
---
both
capital
thing
in
their
way
---
do
not
agree
together

Jerry

a
tall
black

whiskered
man
in
a
velveteen

who
seem
well
known
to

accost
them
with
great
cordiality

<EOS>
disencumber
himself
of
a
barrel
organ

upon

to
awe
his

up

Short

no

the
affirmative

and

him
creep
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
some
uneasiness
at
the
anxiety
of
these
man
,
increase
by
the
recollection
of
their
whisper
together
down
stair
and
their
slight
confusion
when
she
awake
,
nor
be
she
quite
free
from
a
misgiving
that
they
be
not
the
fit
companion
she
could
have
stumble
on
.
 
<EOS>
Her
uneasiness
,
however
,
be
nothing
,
weigh
against
her
fatigue
;
and
she
soon
forget
it
in
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
very
early
next
morning
,
Short
fulfil
his
promise
,
and
knock
softly
at
her
door
,
entreat
that
she
would
get
up
directly
,
as
the
proprietor
of
the
dog
be
still
snore
,
and
if
they
lose
no
time
they
may
get
a
good
deal
in
advance
both
of
him
and
the
conjuror
,
who
be
talk
in
his
sleep
,
and
from
what
he
could
be
hear
to
say
,
appear
to
be
balance
a
donkey
in
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
She
start
from
her
bed
without
delay
,
and
rouse
the
old
man
with
so
much
expedition
that
they
be
both
ready
as
soon
as
Short
himself
,
to
that
gentleman
's
unspeakable
gratification
and
relief
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
very
unceremonious
and
scramble
breakfast
,
of
which
the
staple
commodity
be
bacon
and
bread
,
and
beer
,
they
take
leave
of
the
landlord
and
issue
from
the
door
of
the
jolly
Sandboys
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
be
fine
and
warm
,
the
ground
cool
to
the
foot
after
the
late
rain
,
the
hedge
gayer
and
more
green
,
the
air
clear
,
and
everything
fresh
and
healthful
.
 
<EOS>
surround
by
these
influence
,
they
walk
on
pleasantly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
very
far
,
when
the
child
be
again
strike
by
the
alter
behaviour
of
Mr
Thomas
Codlin
,
who
instead
of
plod
on
sulkily
by
himself
as
he
have
heretofore
do
,
keep
close
to
her
,
and
when
he
have
an
opportunity
of
look
at
her
unseen
by
his
companion
,
warn
her
by
certain
wry
face
and
jerk
of
the
head
not
to
put
any
trust
in
Short
,
but
to
reserve
all
confidence
for
Codlin
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
he
confine
himself
to
look
and
gesture
,
for
when
she
and
her
grandfather
be
walk
on
beside
the
aforesaid
Short
,
and
that
little
man
be
talk
with
his
accustomed
cheerfulness
on
a
variety
of
indifferent
subject
,
Thomas
Codlin
testify
his
jealousy
and
distrust
by
follow
close
at
her
heel
,
and
occasionally
admonish
her
ankle
with
the
leg
of
the
theatre
in
a
very
abrupt
and
painful
manner
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
proceeding
naturally
make
the
child
more
watchful
and
suspicious
,
and
she
soon
observe
that
whenever
they
halt
to
perform
outside
a
village
alehouse
or
other
place
,
Mr
Codlin
while
he
go
through
his
share
of
the
entertainment
keep
his
eye
steadily
upon
her
and
the
old
man
,
or
with
a
show
of
great
friendship
and
consideration
invite
the
latter
to
lean
upon
his
arm
,
and
so
hold
him
tight
until
the
representation
be
over
and
they
again
go
forward
.
 
<EOS>
even
Short
seem
to
change
in
this
respect
,
and
to
mingle
with
his
good
-
nature
something
of
a
desire
to
keep
them
in
safe
custody
.
 
<EOS>
this
increase
the

misgiving

how
strange
it

such
fine
honest

should
seem
to
make
vagabond
of

if

that
be
the
very
moment

Short

the
quarter

stave
vigorously
and
knock
the
character
in
the
fury
of
the
combat
against
the
side
of
the
show
,
the
people
be
look
on
with
laugh
face
,
and
Mr

have
relax
into
a
grim
smile
as
his
rove
eye
detect
hand
go
into
waistcoat
pocket

grope
secretly
for
sixpence

<EOS>
if
they
be

that
be
the
very
moment

<EOS>
They
seize
it
,
and
flee

<EOS>
They
make
a
path
through
booth
and
carriage
and
throng
of
people
,
and
never
once
stop
to
look
behind

<EOS>
the
bell
be

and
the
course
be
clear
by
the

they
reach
the
rope

they
dash
across
it
insensible
to
the
shout
and
screech
that
assail
them
for
break
in
upon
its
sanctity
,
and
creep
under

his

much
commend

His

arrive
to

the
humble

offer

another

They

the

so

"

the

momentary

the
vexed
look
become
a

one
before
it

cross
the

"
then
what
do
you

You

scratch
his

mournfully
,
in
reluctant

clamber
up
to
the
old
nail
take
down
the
cage
and
set
himself
to
clean
it

to
feed
the

<EOS>
His
thought
revert
from
this
occupation
to
the
little
old
gentleman
who
have
give
him
the
shilling

he
suddenly
recollect
that
that
be
the
very
day

nay
,
nearly
the
very
hour
---
at
which
the
little
old

have
say
he
should
be
at
the
Notary

house
again

He
no
sooner
remember
this
,
than
he
hang
up
the
cage
with
great
precipitation
,

hastily
explain
the
nature
of
his
errand
,
go
off
at
full
speed
to
the
appoint
place

<EOS>
It
be
some
two
minute
after
the
time
when
he
reach
the
spot
,
which
be
a
considerable
distance
from
his
home
,
but
by
great
good
luck
the
little
old
gentleman
have
not
yet
arrive
;
at
least
there
be
no
pony
-
chaise
to
be
see
,
and
it
be
not
likely
that
he
have
come
and
go
again
in
so
short
a
space
.
 
<EOS>
greatly
relieved
to
find
that
he
be
not
too
late

kit
leant
against
a
lamp
-
post
to
take
breath
,
and
wait
the
advent
of
the
pony

his
charge

sure
enough
,
before
long
the
pony
come
trot
round
the
corner
of
the
street

look
as
obstinate
as
pony
may
,
and
pick
his
step
as
if
he
be
spy
about
for
the
clean
place

would
by
no
means
dirty
his
foot

hurry
himself
inconveniently
.
 
<EOS>
behind
the

sit
the
little
old

by
the
old
gentleman

side
sit
the
little
old
lady
,
carry
just
such
a
nosegay
as
she
have
bring
before

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
the
old
lady
,
the
pony

the
chaise
,
come
up
the
street
in
perfect
unanimity
,
until
they
arrive
within
some
half
a
dozen
door
of
the
Notary

house

,
deceive
by
a
brass
-
plate
beneath
a
tailor

knocker
,
come
to
a
halt
,

sturdy
silence

"
now
,
Sir

will
you
ha

the
goodness

go
on

the

look
with
great
attention
into
a
fire

plug

near
him

appear
to

good

well

I
do
not

what
we
be
to
do
with
him

I
really
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
the
pony
have
thoroughly
satisfy
himself
as
to
the
nature
and
property
of
the
fire
-
plug
,
look
into
the
air
after
his
old
enemy
the
fly
,
and
as
there
happen
to
be
one
of
them
tickle
his
ear
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
shake
his
head
and
whisk
his
tail
,
after
which
he
appear
full
of
thought
but
quite
comfortable
and
collect
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
have
exhaust
his
power
of
persuasion
,
alight
to
lead
him
;
whereupon
the
pony
,
perhaps
because
he
hold
this
to
be
a
sufficient
concession
,
perhaps
because
he
happen
to
catch
sight
of
the
other
brass
-
plate
,
or
perhaps
because
he
be
in
a
spiteful
humour
,
dart
off
with
the
old
lady
and
stop
at
the
right
house
,
leave
the
old
gentleman
to
come
pant
on
behind
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
kit
present
himself
at
the
pony
's
head
,
and
touch
his
hat
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
why

cry
the
old

<EOS>
"
I
be

the

<EOS>
"
a
very
good

<EOS>
kit
acknowledge
these
expression
of
confidence
by
touch
his
hat
again
and
blush
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
the
old

then
hand
the
old
lady
out
,
and
after
look
at
him
with
an
approve
smile
,
they
go
into
the
house
---
talk
about
him
as
they
go
,
kit
could
not
help
feel
.
 
<EOS>
presently
Mr
Witherden
,
smell
very
hard
at
the
nosegay
,
come
to
the
window
and
look
at
him
,
and
after
that
Mr
Abel
come
and
look
at
him
,
and
after
that
the
old
gentleman
and
lady
come
and
look
at
him
again
,
and
after
that
they
all
come
and
look
at
him
together
,
which
Kit
,
feel
very
much
embarrassed
by
,
make
a
pretence
of
not
observe
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
pat
the
pony
more
and
more
;
and
this
liberty
the
pony
most
handsomely
permit
.
  
<EOS>
the
face
have
not
disappear
from
the
window
many
moment
,
when
Mr
Chuckster
in
his
official
coat
,
and
with
his
hat
hang
on
his
head
just
as
it
happen
to
fall
from
its
peg
,
appear
upon
the
pavement
,
and
tell
him
he
be
want
inside
,
bade
him
go
in
and
he
would
mind
the
chaise
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
in
give
him
this
direction
Mr
Chuckster
remark
that
he
wish
that
he
may
be
bless
if
he
could
make
out
whether
he
(
kit
)
be
"
precious
raw
"
or
"
precious
deep
,
"
but
intimate
by
a
distrustful
shake
of
the
head
,
that
he
incline
to
the
latter
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
kit
enter
the
office
in
a
great
tremor
,
for
he
be
not
use
to
go
among
strange
lady
and
gentleman
,
and
the
tin
box
and
bundle
of
dusty
paper
have
in
his
eye
an
awful
and
venerable
air
.
<EOS>
Mr
Witherden
too
be
a
bustling
gentleman
who
talk
loud
and
fast
,
and
all
eye
be
upon
him
,
and
he
be
very
shabby
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
boy
,
"
say
Mr
Witherden
,
"
you
come
to
work
out
that
shill
;
---
not
to
get
another
,
hey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
indeed
,
sir
,
"
replied
kit
,
take
courage
to
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
alive
?
"

the
Notary
.
  
<EOS>
"
dead

"
  
<EOS>
"
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Married
again
---
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
kit
make
answer
,
not
without
some
indignation
,
that
she
be
a
widow
with
three
child
,
and
that
as
to
her
marry
again
,
if
the
gentleman
know
her
he
would
not
think
of
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
reply
Mr
Witherden
bury
his
nose
in
the
flower
again
,
and
whisper
behind
the
nosegay
to
the
old
gentleman
that
he
believe
the
lad
be
as
honest
a
lad
as
need
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Mr
Garland
when
they
have
make
some
further
inquiry
of
him
,
"
I
be
not
go
to
give
you
anything
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
Kit
reply
;
and
quite
seriously
too
,
for
this
announcement
seem
to
free
him
from
the
suspicion
which
the
Notary
have
hint
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
but
,
"
resume
the
old
gentleman
,
"
perhaps
I
may
want
to
know
something
more
about
you
,
so
tell
me
where
you
live
,
and
I
will
put
it
down
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
kit
tell
him
,
and
the
old
gentleman
write
down
the
address
with
his
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
do
so
,
when
there
be
a
great
uproar
in
the
street
,
and
the
old
lady
hurry
to
the
window
cry
that
Whisker
have
run
away
,
upon
which
kit
dart
out
to
the
rescue
,
and
the
other
follow
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
that
Mr
Chuckster
have
be
stand
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
look
carelessly
at
the
pony
,
and
occasionally
insult
him
with
such
admonition
as
"
stand
still
,
"
---
<EOS>
"
be
quiet
,
"
---
"
Wo
-
a
-
a
,
"
and
the
like
,
which
by
a
pony
of
spirit
can
not
be
bear
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
the
pony
be
deter
by
no
consideration
of
duty
or
obedience
,
and
not
have
before
him
the
slight

<EOS>
still
cast
about

some
plausible
mean
of
account
for
their
non

appearance
,
and
of
persuade
himself
that

soon
return

he
bend
his

towards

,
intend
to
finish
the
task
which

sudden
recollection
of
his

have
interrupt
,
and
then
to
sally
forth
once
more
to
seek
his
fortune
for
the

.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
the
corner
of
the

in

he
live
,
lo
and
behold
there

the
pony
again
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
there
he
be
,
look
more
obstinate
than
ever
;
and
alone
in
the
chaise
,
keep
a
steady
watch
upon
his
every
wink
,
sit
Mr
Abel
,
<EOS>
who
,
lift
up
his
eye
by
chance
and
see
kit
pass
by
,
nod
to
him
as
though
he
would
have

his
head
off

<EOS>
kit
wonder
to
see
the
pony
again
,
so
near
his
own
home
too
,
but
it
never
occur
to
him
for
what
purpose
the
pony
may
have
come
there
,
or
where
the
old
lady
and
the
old
gentleman
have
go
,
until
he
lift
the
latch
of
the
door
,
and
walk
in
,
find
them
seat
in
the
room
in
conversation
with
his
mother
,
at
which
unexpected
sight
he
pull
off
his
hat
and
make
his
good
bow
in
some
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
We

here
before

Mr

<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir

"
say
kit
;
and
as
he
say
it
,
he
look
towards
his
mother
for
an
explanation
of
the
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
gentleman
be
be
kind
enough
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
in
reply
to
this
mute
interrogation
,
"
to
ask
me
whether
you
be
in
a
good
place
,
or
in
any
place
at
all
,
and
when
I
tell
him
no
,
you
be
not
in

he
be
so
good
as
to
say
that
---
"
  
"
---
that
we
want
a
good
lad
in
our
house
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
and
the
old
lady
both
together
,
"
and
that
perhaps
we
may
think
of
it
,
if
we
find
everything
as
we
would
wish
it
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
this
thinking
of
it
,
plainly

the
thinking
of
engage
kit
,
he
immediately
partake
of
his
mother
's
anxiety
and
fall
into
a
great
flutter
;
for
the
little
old
couple
be
very
methodical
and
cautious
,
and
ask
so
many
question
that
he
begin
to
be
afraid
there
be
no
chance
of
his
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
good
woman
,
"
say
Mrs
Garland
to
Kit
's
mother
,
"
that
it
be
necessary
to
be
very
careful
and
particular
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
for
we
be
only
three
in
family
,
and
be
very
quiet
regular
folk
,
and
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
if
we
make
any
kind
of
mistake
,
and
find
thing
different
from
what
we
hope
and
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
,
kit
's
mother
reply
,
that
certainly
it
be
quite
true
,
and
quite
right
,
and
quite
proper
,
and
Heaven
forbid
that
she
should
shrink
,
or
have
cause
to
shrink
,
from
any
inquiry
into
her
character
or
that
of
her
son
,
who
be
a
very
good
son
though
she
be
his
mother
,
in
which
respect
,
she
be
bold
to
say
,
he
take
after
his
father
,
who
be
not
only
a
good
son
to
his
mother
,
but
the
good
of
husband
and
the
good
of
father
besides
,
which
kit
could
and
would
corroborate
she
know
,
and
so
would
little
Jacob
and
the
baby
<EOS>
likewise
if
they
be
old
enough
,
which
unfortunately
they
be
not
,
though
as
they
do
not
know
what
a
loss
they
have
have
,
perhaps
it
be
a
great
deal
better
that
they
should
be
as
young
as
they
be
;
and
so
Kit
's
mother
wind
up
a
long
story
by
wipe
her
eye
with
her
apron
,
and
pat
little
Jacob
's
head
,
who
be
rock
the
cradle
and
stare
with
all
his
might
at
the
strange
lady
and
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
when
kit
's
mother
have
do
speak
,
the
old
lady
strike
in
again
,
and
say
that
she
be
quite
sure
she
be
a
very
honest
and
very
respectable
person
or
she
never
would
have
express
herself
in
that
manner
,
and
that
certainly
the
appearance
of
the
child
and
the
cleanliness
of
the
house
deserve
great
praise
and
do
her
the
utmost
credit
,
whereat
kit
's
mother
drop
a
curtsey
and
become
consoled
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
good
woman
enter
in
a
long
and
minute
account
of
Kit
's
life
and
history
from
the
early
period
down
to
that
time
,
not
omit
to
make
mention
of
his
miraculous
fall
out
of
a
back
-
parlour
window
when
an
infant
of
tender
year
,
or
his
uncommon
suffering
in
a
state
of
measle
,
which
be
illustrate
by
correct
imitation
of
the
plaintive
manner
in
which
he
call
for
toast
and
water
,
day
and
night
,
and
say
,
"
do
not
cry
,
mother
,
I
shall
soon
be
well
;
"
for
proof
of
which
statement
reference

make
to
Mrs
Green
,
lodger
,
at
the
cheesemonger

round
the
corner
,
and
diver
other

gentleman

various
part
of
England

Wales
(
and
one
Mr

East
Indies

and
who
could
of
course

with
very
little
trouble

,
within
whose
personal
knowledge
the
circumstance
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
this
narration
end
,
Mr
Garland
put
some
question
to
kit
respect
his
qualification
and
general
acquirement
,
while
Mrs

notice

and
hear
from

other
remarkable
circumstance
which

beyond

what
condition
or
age

<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to

which
party

most
pleased
with
this
arrangement
,
the
conclusion
of
which

with
nothing
but
pleasant
look
and
cheerful
smile
on

<EOS>
It
be
settle
that

repair
to
his
new
abode
on
the
next
day

in

morning
;
and
finally

secret
reason

his
uncommon
disappointment

in
the
hope

that

snap
his

defiance

contempt

sufficiently

achieve
a

dance
round

just
without

<EOS>
the
remainder
of
that
day

the
whole

next
be
a
busy
time
for
the
Nubbles

,
to
whom
everything
connect
with
Kit

outfit
and
departure
be
matter
of
as
great
moment
as
if

about

penetrate
into
the
interior
of
Africa
,

to
take
a
cruise
round
the

It
would
be
difficult

suppose
that

ever
be
a
box
which
be
open
and
shut
so
many
time
within
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
,
as
that
which
contain
his
wardrobe
and
necessary
;
and
certainly
there
never
be
one
which
to
two
small
eye
present
such
a
mine
of
clothing
,
as
this
mighty
chest
with
its

convey

at
Finchley
Kit
be

find
it
next
day
;
and
the
box
be
go
<EOS>
,
there
remain
but
two
question
for
consideration
:
firstly
,
whether
the
carrier
would
lose
,
or
dishonestly
feign
to
lose
,
the
box
upon
the
road
;
secondly
,
whether
Kit
's
mother
perfectly
understand
how
to
take
care
of
herself
in
the
absence
of
her
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

temptation
to
pretend
they

apprehensively

in

the
first
point

inwardly
resolve
that

never

a

any
more

with
an

form
this
christian
determination

question

Mr

all

the

no

Mr

advance
with
the
view
of
inflict
upon
him
condign
chastisement

<EOS>
but
forget
his
purpose
or
change
his
mind
before
he
come
close
to
him

he
seize
his

eternal
friendship

declare
with
an
agreeable
frankness
that
from
that
time

pathetic

of
Miss
Wackles

the

incoherency
he
may
observe
in
his
speech

which
be
attributable
solely
to
the
strength
of
his
affection

not

then
they
go
on

Quilp
glance
at
his
free

spoken
friend
with
a
mingled
expression
of
cunning
and
dislike
,
and
wring
his
hand
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
declare
that
he
be
an
uncommon
character
and
have
his
warm
esteem

<EOS>
with
that
they
part
;
Mr
Swiveller
to
make
the
good
of
his
way
home
and
sleep
himself
sober
;
and
Quilp
to
cogitate
upon
the
discovery
he
have
make
,
and
exult
in
the
prospect
of
the
rich
field
of
enjoyment
and
reprisal
it
open
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
great
reluctance
and
misgive
that
Mr
Swiveller
,
next
morning
,
his
head
rack
by
the
fume
of
the
renowned
Schiedam
,
repair
to
the
lodging
of
his
friend
Trent
(
which
be
in
the
roof
of
an
old
house
in
an
old
ghostly
inn
)
,
and
recount
by
very
slow
degree
what
have
yesterday
take
place
between
him
and
Quilp
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
without
great
surprise
and
much
speculation
on
Quilp
's
probable
motive
,
nor
without
many
bitter
comment
on
Dick
Swiveller
's
folly
,
that
his
friend
receive
the
tale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
defend
myself
,
Fred

"
say
the
penitent
Richard

"
but
the
fellow
have
such
a
queer
way
with
him
and
be
such
an
artful
dog
,
that
first
of
all
he
set
me
upon
think
whether
there
be
any
harm
in
tell
him
,

while
I
be
think
,
screw
it
out
of
me

<EOS>
if
you
have
see
him
drink
and
smoke
,
as
I
do
,
you
could
not
have
keep
anything
from
him

<EOS>
He
be
a
Salamander
you
know

that
be
what
he
be

"
  
<EOS>
without
inquire
whether
salamander
be
of
necessity
good
confidential
agent
,
or
whether
a
fire
-
proof
man
be
as
a
matter
of
course
trustworthy
,
Frederick
Trent
throw
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
,
bury
his
head
in
his
hand
,
endeavour
to
fathom
the
motive
which
have
lead
Quilp
to
insinuate
himself
into
Richard
Swiveller
's
confidence
;
---
for
that
the
disclosure
be
of
his
seeking
,
and
have
not
be
spontaneously
reveal
by
Dick
,
be
sufficiently
plain
from
Quilp
's
seek
his
company
and
entice
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
dwarf
have
twice
encounter
him
when
he
be
endeavour
to
obtain
intelligence
of
the
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
perhaps
,
as
he
have
not
show
any
previous
anxiety
about
them
,
be
enough
to
awaken
suspicion
in
the
breast
of
a
creature
so
jealous
and
distrustful
by
nature
,
set
aside
any
additional
impulse
to
curiosity
that
he
may
have
derive
from
Dick
's
incautious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
but
know
the
scheme
they
have
plan
,
why
should
he
offer
to
assist
it
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
more
difficult
of
solution
;
but
as
knave
generally
overreach
themselves
by
impute
their
own
design
to
other
,
the
idea
immediately
present
itself
that
some
circumstance
of
irritation
between
Quilp
and
the
old
man
,
arise
out
of
their
secret
transaction
and
not
unconnected
perhaps
with
his
sudden
disappearance
,
now
render
the
former
desirous
of
revenge
himself
upon
him
by
seek
to
entrap
the
sole
object
of
his
love
and
anxiety
into
a
connexion
of
which
he
know
he
have
a
dread
and
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
as
Frederick
Trent
himself
,
utterly
regardless
of
his
sister
,
have
this
object
at
heart
,
only
second
to
the
hope
of
gain
,
it
seem
to
him
the
more
likely
to
be
Quilp
's
main
principle
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
once
invest
the
dwarf
with
a
design
of
his
own
in
abet
them
,
which
the
attainment
of
their
purpose
would
serve
,
it
be
easy
to
believe
him
sincere
and
hearty
in
the
cause
;
and
as
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
prove
a
powerful
and
useful
auxiliary
,
trent
determine
to
accept
his
invitation
and
go
to
his
house
that
night
,
and
if
what
he
say
and
do
confirm
him
in
the
impression
he
have
form
,
to
let
him
share
the
labour
of
their
plan
,
but
not
the
profit
.
  
<EOS>
have
revolve
these
thing
in
his
mind
and
arrive
at
this
conclusion
,
he
communicate
to
Mr
Swiveller
as
much
of
his
meditation
as
he
think
proper
<EOS>
(
Dick
would
have
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
less
)
,
and
give
him
the
day
to
recover
himself
from
his
late
salamandering
,
accompany
him
at
evening
to
Mr
Quilp
's
house

<EOS>
mighty
glad
<EOS>
Mr
Quilp
be
to
see
them
,

mightily
glad
he
seem
to
be
;
and
fearfully
polite
<EOS>
Mr
Quilp
be
to
Mrs
Quilp
and
Mrs
jiniwin
;
and
very
sharp
be
the
look
he
cast
on
his
wife
to
observe
how
she
be
affect
by
the
recognition
of
young
Trent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Quilp
be
as
innocent
as
her
own
mother
of
any
emotion
,
painful
or
pleasant
,
which
the
sight
of
him
awaken
,
but
as
her
husband
's
glance
make
her
timid
and
confused
,
and
uncertain
what
to
do
or
what
be
require
of
her
,
Mr
Quilp
do
not
fail
to
assign
her
embarrassment
to
the
cause
he
have
in
his
mind
,
and
while
he
chuckle
at
his
penetration
be
secretly
exasperate
by
his
jealousy
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
of
this
appear
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
Mr
Quilp
be
all
blandness
and
suavity
,
and
preside
over
the
case
-
bottle
of
rum
with
extraordinary
open
-
heartedness

<EOS>
"
why
,
let
me
see
,
"
say
Quilp
.

It
must
be
a
matter
of
nearly
two
year

Quilp

how
fast
time
fly

do
it
seem
as
long
as
that
to
you
,
Mrs

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
it
seem
full
three
year
,
Quilp
,
"
be
the
unfortunate
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
indeed
,
madam
,
"
think
Quilp
,
"
you
have
be
pine
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
very
good
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me

yesterday
that
you
go
out
to
Demerara
in
the
Mary
Anne

Quilp
;
"
but
yesterday
,
I
declare

well

I
like
a
little
wildness

I
be
wild
myself
once

<EOS>
Mr
Quilp
accompany
this
admission
with
such
an
awful
wink
,
indicative
of
old
roving
and
backsliding
,
that
Mrs
Jiniwin
be
indignant
,
and
could
not
forbear
from
remark
under
her
breath
that
he
may
at
least
put
off
his
confession
until
his
wife
be
absent
;
for
which
act
of
boldness
and
insubordination
Mr
Quilp
first
stare
her
out
of
countenance
and
then
drank
her
health
ceremoniously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
come
back
directly

I
always

down

when

not

the
theme
be
the
most
agreeable
one
that
could
have
be
select
for
his
entertainment

for
that
reason
Quilp
pursue
it
.
  
<EOS>

I
always
will
say

resume
,

that
when

a
movement
of
impatience

go
on
as
calmly
as
if
he
be
discuss
some
abstract
question
in
which
nobody
present
have
the
slight
personal

"
It
be
very
true

that
your

urge
repeat
forgiveness

up

moment

stretch
out

to

,
know
that
Richard
Swiveller
be
a
mere
tool
in
his
hand
and
know
no
more
of
his
design
than
he
think
proper
to
communicate
,
see
that
the
dwarf
perfectly
understand
their
relative
position
,
and
fully
enter
into
the
character
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
be
appreciate
,
even
in
knavery
.
 
<EOS>
this
silent
homage
to
his
superior
ability
,
no
less
than
a
sense
of
the
power
with
which
the
dwarf
's
quick
perception
have
already
invest
him
,
incline
the
young
man
towards
that
ugly
worthy
,
and
determine
him
to
profit
by
his
aid
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
Mr
Quilp
's
cue
to
change
the
subject
with
all
convenient
expedition
,
lest
Richard
Swiveller
in
his
heedlessness
should
reveal
anything
which
it
be
inexpedient
for
the
woman
to
know
,
he
propose
a
game
at
four
-
handed
cribbage
,
and
partner
be
cut
for
,
Mrs
Quilp
fall
to
Frederick
Trent
,
and
Dick
himself
to
Quilp
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jiniwin
be
very
fond
of
card
be
carefully
exclude
by
her
son
-
in
-
law
from
any
participation
in
the
game
,
and
have
assign
to
her
the
duty
of
occasionally
replenish
the
glass
from
the
case
-
bottle
;
Mr
Quilp
from
that
moment
keep
one
eye
constantly
upon
her
,
lest
she
should
by
any
mean
procure
a
taste
of
the
same
,
and
thereby
tantalise
the
wretched
old
lady
(
who
be
as
much
attach
to
the
case
-
bottle
as
the
card
)
in
a
double
degree
and
most
ingenious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
Mrs
Jiniwin
alone
that
Mr
Quilp
's
attention
be
restrict
,
as
several
other
matter
require
his
constant
vigilance
.
 
<EOS>
among
his
various
eccentric
habit
he
have
a
humorous
one
of
always
cheat
at
card
,
which
render
necessary
on
his
part
,
not
only
a
close
observance
of
the
game
,
and
a
sleight
-
of
-
hand
in
counting
and
score
,
but
also
involve
the
constant
correction
,
by
look
,
and
frown
,
and
kick
under
the
table
,
of
Richard
Swiveller
,
who
be
bewilder
by
the
rapidity
with
which
his
card
be
tell
,
and
the
rate
at
which
the
peg
travel
down
the
board
,
could
not
be
prevent
from
sometimes
express
his
surprise
and
incredulity
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Quilp
too
be
the
partner
of
young
Trent
,
and
for
every
look
that
pass
between
them
,
and
every
word
they
speak
,
and
every
card
they
play
,
the
dwarf
have
eye
and
ear
;
not
occupy
alone
with
what
be
pass
above
the
table
,
but
with
signal
that
may
be
exchange
beneath
it
,
which
he
lay
all
kind
of
trap
to
detect
;
besides
often
tread
on
his
wife
's
toe
to
see
whether
she
cry
out
or
remain
silent
under
the
infliction
,
in
which
latter
case
it
would
have
be
quite
clear
that
Trent
have
be
tread
on
her
toe
before
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
in
the
most
of
all
these
distraction
,
the
one
eye
be
upon
the
old
lady
always
,
and
if
she
so
much
as
stealthily
advance
a
tea
-
spoon
towards
a
neighbour
glass
(
which
she
often
do
)
,
for
the
purpose
of
abstracting
but
one
sup
of
its
sweet
content
,
Quilp
's
hand
would
overset
it
in
the
very
moment
of
her
triumph
,
and
Quilp
's
mock
voice
implore
her
to
regard
her
precious
health
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
any
one
of
these
his
many
care
,
from
first
to
last
,
Quilp
never
flag
nor
falter
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
when
they
have
play
a
great
many
rubber
and
draw
pretty
freely
upon
the

,
Mr
Quilp
warn
his
lady
to
retire
to
rest
,
and
that
submissive

complying
,
and
be
follow
by
her
indignant
mother

Mr

fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
the
dwarf
beckon
his
remain
companion
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
hold
a
short
conference
with
him
in
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
well
not
to
say
more
than
one
can
help
before
our
worthy
friend
,
"
say
Quilp
,
make
a
grimace
towards
the
slumber
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
bargain
between
us
,
Fred
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
he
marry
little
rosy
<EOS>
Nell
by
-
and
-
by
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
end
of
your
own
to
answer
,
of

,
"
return
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
have
,
dear
Fred

say
Quilp
,
grin
to
think
how
little
he
suspect
what
the
real
end
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
retaliation
perhaps
;
perhaps
whim
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
influence
,
Fred
,
to
help
or
oppose
.
<EOS>
which
way
shall
I
use
it
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pair
of
scale
,
and
it
go
into
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
throw
it
into
mine
then
,
"
say
trent
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
do
,
Fred
,
"
rejoin
Quilp
,
stretch
out
his
clenched
hand
and
opening
it
as
if
he
have
let
some
weight
fall
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
the
scale
from
this
time
,
and
turn
it
,
Fred
.
 
<EOS>
mind
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
have
they
go
?
"
ask
Trent
.
  
<EOS>
Quilp
shake
his
head
,
and
say
that
point
remain
to
be
discover
,
which
it
may
be
,
easily
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
,
they
would
begin
their
preliminary
advance
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
visit
the
old
man
,
or
even
Richard
Swiveller
may
visit
him
,
and
by
affect
a
deep
concern
in
his
behalf
,
and
implore
him
to
settle
in
some
worthy
home
,
lead
to
the
child
's
remember
him
with
gratitude
and
favour
.
 
<EOS>
once
impressed
to
this
extent
,
it
would
be
easy
,
he
say
,
to
win
her
in
a
year
or
two
,
for
she
suppose
the
old
man
to
be
poor
,
as
it
be
a
part
of
his
jealous
policy
(
in
common
with
many
other
miser
)
to
feign
to
be
so
,
to
those
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
feign
it
often
enough
to
me
,
of
late
,
"
say
trent
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
and
to
me
too
!
"
reply
the
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
which
be
more
extraordinary
,
as
I
know
how
rich
he
really
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
should
,
"
say
trent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
should
indeed
,
"
rejoin
the
dwarf
;
and
in
that
,
at
least
,
he
speak
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
few
more
whispered
word
,
they
return
to
the
table
,
and
the
young
man
rouse
Richard
Swiveller
inform
him
that
he
be
wait
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
welcome
news
to
Dick
,
who
start
up
directly
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
word
of
confidence
in
the
result
of
their
project
have
be
exchange
,
they
bid
the
grin
Quilp
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
Quilp
creep
to
the
window
as
they
pass
in
the
street
below
,
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Trent
be
pronounce
an
encomium
upon
his
wife
,
and
they
be
both
wonder
by
what
enchantment
<EOS>
she
have
be
bring
to
marry
such
a
misshapen
wretch
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
the
dwarf
after
watch
their
retreat
shadow
with
a
wide
grin
than
his
face
have
yet
display
,
steal
softly
in
the
dark
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
hatching
of
their
scheme
,
neither
Trent
nor
Quilp
have
have
one
think
about
the
happiness
or
misery
of
poor
innocent
Nell
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
strange
if
the
careless
profligate
,
who
be
the
butt
of
both
,
have
be
harass
by
any
such
consideration
;
for
his
high
opinion
of
his
own
merit
and
desert
render
the
project
rather
a
laudable
one
than
otherwise
;
and
if
he
have
be
visit
by
so
unwonted
a
guest
as
reflection
,
he
would
---
be
a
brute
only
in
the
gratification
of
his
appetite
---
have
soothe
his
conscience
with
the
plea
that
he
do
not
mean
to
beat
or
kill
his
wife
,
and
would
therefore
,
after
all
say
and
do
,
be
a
very
tolerable
,
average
husband
.

<EOS>
It
be
not
until
they
be
quite
exhausted
and
could
no
longer
maintain
the
pace
at
which
they
have
flee
from
the
race
-
ground
,
that
the
old
man
and
the
child
venture
to
stop
,
and
sit
down
to
rest
upon
the
border
of
a
little
wood
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
though
the
course
be
hide
from
their
view
,
they
could
yet
faintly
distinguish
the
noise
of
distant
shout
,
the
hum
of
voice
,
and
the
beating
of
drum
.
 
<EOS>
climb
the
eminence
which
lie
between
them
and
the
spot
they
have
leave
,
the

could
even
discern
the
flutter
flag
and
white
top
of
booth

but
no
person
be
approach
towards
them
,
and
their
resting

place
be
solitary
and
still
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
elapse
before
she
could
reassure
her
tremble
companion
,
or
restore
him
to
a
state
of
moderate
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
His
disordered
imagination
represent
to
him
a
crowd
of
person
steal
towards
them
beneath
the
cover
of
the
bush
,
lurk
in
every
ditch
,
and
peep
from
the
bough
of
every
rustling
tree
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
haunt
by
apprehension
of
be
lead
captive
to
some
gloomy
place
where
he
would
be
chain
and
scourge
,
and
bad
than
all

where
Nell
could
never
come
to
see
him
,
save
through
iron
bar
and
grating
in
the

<EOS>
His
terror
affect
the
child

<EOS>
separation
from
her
grandfather
be
the
great
evil
she
could
dread
;
and
feel
for
the
time
as
though
,
go
where
they
would
,
they
be
to
be
hunt
down
,
and
could
never
be
safe
but
in
hiding
,
her
heart
fail
her

and
her

droop

<EOS>
in
one
so
young
,
and
so
unused
to
the
scene
in
which
she
have
lately

,
this
sinking
of
the

be
not

<EOS>
but
,
Nature
often
enshrine
gallant

in
weak
bosom
---
oftenest
<EOS>
,
God
bless
her

in

and
<EOS>
when
the

,
cast
her
tearful
eye
upon
the
old

,
remember
how
weak
he
be

and
how
destitute

helpless
he
would
be
if
she
fail
him

her

swell

animate
her
with
new

here

down

when

up

through

her
tiny

in

elastic
from
so
light
a

she
lure
the

on

with

stealthily
to
some
lone
bird
as

perch

trunk

stout
old
tree

open
long

as

cheerful

the

at

bring

to
the
end

into
a
public
road

<EOS>
take
their

along

they
come

lane

so
shade
by

over

the

a

post
announce

three
mile
off

appear

at

to

it

with

and
the
clustered
house
of
the
village
peep
from
the
woody
hollow
below
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
small
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
and
boy
be
play
at
cricket
on
the
green
;
and
as
the
other
folk
be
look
on
,
they
wander
up
and
down
,
uncertain
where
to
seek
a
humble
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
old
man
in
the
little
garden
before
his
cottage
,
and
him
<EOS>
they
be
timid
of
approach
,
for
he
be
the
schoolmaster
,
and
have
"
School
"
write
up
over
his
window
in
black
letter
on
a
white
board
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
pale
,
simple
-
looking
man
,
of
a
spare
and
meagre
habit
,
and
sit
among
his
flower
and
beehive
,
smoke
his
pipe
,
in
the
little
porch
before
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
speak
to
him
,
dear
,
"
the
old
man
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
afraid
to
disturb
him
,
"
say
the
child
timidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
seem
to
see
us
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
if
we
wait
a
little
,
he
may
look
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
wait
,
but
the
schoolmaster
cast
no
look
towards
them
,
and
still
sit
,
thoughtful
and
silent
,
in
the
little
porch
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
kind
face
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
plain
old
suit
of
black
,
he
look
pale
and
meagre
.
 
<EOS>
They
fancy
,
too
,
a
lonely
air
about
him
and
his
house
,
but
perhaps
that
be
because
the
other
people
form
a
merry
company
upon
the
green
,
and
he
seem
the
only
solitary
man
in
all
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
very
tired
,
and
the
child
would
have
be
bold
enough
to
address
even
a
schoolmaster
,
but
for
something
in
his
manner
which
seem
to
denote
that
he
be
uneasy
or
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
stand
hesitate
at
a
little
distance
,
they
see
that
he
sit
for
a
few
minute
at
a
time
like
one
in
a
brown
study
,
then
lay
aside
his
pipe
and
take
a
few
turn
in
his
garden
,
then
approach
the
gate
and
look
towards
the
green
,
then
take
up
his
pipe
again
with
a
sigh
,
and
sit
down
thoughtfully
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
as
nobody
else
appear
and
it
would
soon
be
dark
,
<EOS>
Nell
at
length
take
courage
,
and
when
he
have
resume
his
pipe
and
seat
,
venture
to
draw
near
,
lead
her
grandfather
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
slight
noise
they
make
in
raise
the
latch
of
the
wicket

catch
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
them
kindly
but
seem
disappointed
too
,
and
slightly
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Nell
drop
a
curtsey
,
and
tell
him
they
be
poor
traveller
who
seek
a
shelter
for
the
night
which
they
would
gladly
pay
for
,
so
far
as
their
mean

<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
look
earnestly
at
her
as
she
speak
,
lay
aside
his
pipe
,
and
rise
up
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"

one
may
contemplate
a
beautiful

with
something
of
sadness
in
his
voice
and
manner
which
quite
touch
the
child

though
she
be
unacquainted
with
its

fond

there
the

be
the
vacant

the
little

<EOS>
no

attempt
to
violate
the
sanctity
of

but
many
a
one
look
from
the
empty
space
to
the
schoolmaster
,
and
whisper
his
idle
neighbour
behind
his
hand

<EOS>
then
begin
the
hum

get
them
by
heart
,
the
whisper

stealthy
game

and
all
the
noise

of
school

in
the
midst

the
din
sit
the
poor

the
very
image
of
meekness
and
simplicity
,
vainly
attempt
to
fix
his
mind
upon
the
duty
of
the
day

and
to
forget
his
little
friend

<EOS>
but
the
tedium
of
his
office
remind
him
more
strongly
of
the
willing
scholar

and
his
thought
be
ramble
from
his
pupil

it
be
plain

<EOS>
none
know
this
well
than
the
idlest
boy

who

grow
bolder
with
impunity

wax
louder
and
more
daring

play
odd
-
or

even
under
the
master

eye
,
eat
apple
openly
and
without
rebuke
,
pinch
each
other
in
sport
or
malice
without
the

and
cut
their
autograph
in

leg

the
puzzle

who
stand
beside

his
lesson
out

look
no
longer
at
the
ceiling
for
forgotten
word
,
but
draw
closer
to
the
master
's
elbow
and
boldly
cast
his
eye
upon
the
page
;
the
wag
of
the
little
troop
squint
and
make
grimace
(
at
the
small
boy

hold
no

his

no

oh

how

idle

plunge
into

ask

out
into

and

his

madness
by
dip
his

then

on

ask

as
that

when
even
the

dive
deep
down
into
the

there

as

no

<EOS>
the
day
be
make
for
laziness

lie
on
one

back
in
green
place

and
stare
at
the
sky
till
its
brightness
force
one
to
shut
one

eye
and
go
to
sleep
;
and
be
this
a
time
to
be
pore
over
musty
book
in
a
dark
room
,
slight
by
the
very
sun
itself

<EOS>
monstrous
!
  
<EOS>
Nell
sit
by
the
window
occupy
with
her
work
,
but
attentive
still
to
all
that
pass
,
though
sometimes
rather
timid
of
the
boisterous
boy
.
 
<EOS>
the
lesson
over
,
writing
time
begin
;
and
there
be
but
one
desk
and
that
the
master
's
,
each
boy
sit
at
it
in
turn
and
labour
at
his
crooked
copy
,
while
the
master
walk
about
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
quieter
time
;
for
he
would
come
and
look
over
the
writer
's
shoulder
,
and
tell
him
mildly
to
observe
how
such
a
letter
be
turn
in
such
a
copy
on
the
wall
,
praise
such
an
up
-
stroke
here
and
such
a
down
-
stroke
there
,
and
bid
him
take
it
for
his
model
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
stop
and
tell
them
what
the
sick
child
have
say
last
night
,
and
how
he
have
long
to
be
among
them
once
again
;
and
such
be
the
poor
schoolmaster
's
gentle
and
affectionate
manner
,
that
the
boy
seem
quite
remorseful
that
they
have
worry
him
so
much
,
and
be
absolutely
quiet
;
eat
no
apple
,
cut
no
name
,
inflict
no
pinche
,
and
make
no
grimace
,
for
full
two
minute
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
boy
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
when
the
clock
strike
twelve
,
"
that
I
shall
give
an
extra
half
-
holiday
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
intelligence
,
the
boy
,
lead
on
and
head
by
the
tall
boy
,
raise
a
great
shout
,
in
the
midst
of
which
the
master
be
see
to
speak
,
but
could
not
be
hear
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
hold
up
his
hand
,
however
,
in
token
of
his
wish
that
they
should
be
silent
,
they
be
considerate
enough
to
leave
off
,
as
soon
as
the
longest
-
wind
among
them
be
quite
out
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
promise
me
first
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
"
that
you
will
not
be
noisy
,
or
at
least
,
if
you
be
,
that
you
will
go
away
and
be
so
---
away
out
of
the
village
<EOS>
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
not
disturb
your
old
playmate
and
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
murmur
(
and
perhaps
a
very
sincere
one
,
for
they
be
but
boy
)
in
the
negative
;
and
the
tall
boy
,
perhaps
as
sincerely
as
any
of
them
,
call
those
about
him
to
witness
that
he
have
only
shout
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
pray
do
not
forget
,
there
be
my
dear
scholar
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
"
what
I
have
ask
you
,
and
do
it
as
a
favour
to
me
.
<EOS>
be
as
happy
as
you
can
,
and
do
not
be
unmindful
that
you
be
bless
with
health

<EOS>
good

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Sir
,
"
and
"
good
-
bye
,
Sir
,
"
be
say
a
good
many
time
in
a
variety
of
voice
,
and
the
boy
go
out
very
slowly
and
softly
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
sun
shine
and
there
be
the
bird
singe
,
as
the
sun
only
shine
and
the
bird
only
sing
on
holiday
and
half
-
holiday
;
there
be
the
tree
wave
to
all
free
boy
to
climb
and
nestle
among
their
leafy
branch
;
the
hay
,
entreat
them
to
come
and
scatter
it
to
the
pure
air
;
the
green
corn
,
gently
beckon
towards
wood
and
stream
;
the
smooth
ground
,
render
smoother
still
by
blend
light
and
shadow
,
invite
to
run
and
leap
,
and
long
walk
God
know
whither
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
boy
could
bear
,
and
with
a
joyous
whoop
the
whole
cluster
take
to
their
heel
and
spread
themselves
about
,
shout
and
laugh
as
they
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
natural
,
thank
Heaven
!
"
say
the
poor
schoolmaster
,
look
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
they
do
not
mind
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
,
however
,
to
please
everybody
,
as
most
of
us
would
have
discover
,
even
without
the
fable
which
bear
that
moral
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
several
mother
and
aunt
of
pupil
look
in
to
express
their
entire
disapproval
of
the
schoolmaster
's
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
confine
themselves
to
hint
,
such
as
politely
inquire
what
red
-
letter
day
or
saint
's
day
the
almanack
say
it
be
;
a
few
(
these
be
the
profound
village
politician
)
argue
that
it
be
a
slight
to
the
throne
and
an
affront
to
church
and
state
,
and
savour
of
revolutionary
principle
,
to
grant
a
half
-
holiday
upon
any
light
occasion
than
the
birthday
of
the
Monarch
;
but
the
majority
express
their
displeasure
on
private
ground
and
in
plain
term
,
argue
that
to
put
the
pupil
on
this
short
allowance
of
learning
be
nothing
but
an
act
of
downright
robbery
and
fraud
:
and
one
old
lady
,
find
that
she
could
not
inflame
or
irritate
the
peaceable
schoolmaster
by
talk
to
him
,
bounce
out
of
his
house
and
talk
at
him
for
half
-
an
-
hour
outside
his
own
window
,
to
another
old
lady
,
say
that
of
course
he
would
deduct
this
half
-
holiday
from
his
weekly
charge
,
or
of
course
he
would
naturally
expect
to
have
an
opposition
start
against
him
;
there
be
no
want
of
idle
chap
in
that
neighbourhood
<EOS>
(
here
the
old
lady
raise
her
voice
)
,
and
some
chap
who
be
too
idle
even
to
be
schoolmaster
,
may
soon
find
that
there
be
other
chap
put
over
their
head
,
and
so
she
would
have
them
take
care
,
and
look
pretty
sharp
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
these
taunt
and
vexation
fail
to
elicit
one
word
from
the
meek
schoolmaster
,
who
sit
with
the
child
by
his
side
---
a
little
more
dejected
perhaps
,
but
quite
silent
and
uncomplaining
.
  
<EOS>
towards
night
an
old
woman
come
totter
up
the
garden
as
speedily
as
she
could
,
and
meet
the
schoolmaster
at
the
door
,
say
he
be
to
go
to
Dame
West
's
directly
,
and
have
best
run
on
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
the
child
be
on
the
point
of
go
out
together
for
a
walk
,
and
without
relinquish
her
hand
,
the
schoolmaster
hurry
away
,
leave
the
messenger
to
follow
as
she
may
.
  
<EOS>
They
stop
at
a
cottage
-
door
,
and
the
schoolmaster
knock
softly
at
it
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
open
without
loss
of
time

<EOS>
They
enter
a
room

a
little
group
of

gather
about
one

the
rest

who
be
cry
very
bitterly

and
sit
wring
her
hand
and
rock
herself
to
and
fro

<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
"
say
the
schoolmaster

draw
near
her

so
bad

He

I

<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
look
round
upon
the
other
woman
as
if
to
entreat
some
one
among
them
to
say
a
kind
word
for
him
,
but
they
shake
their
head
,
and
murmur
to
each
other
that
they
never
think
there
be
much
good
in
learning
,
and
that
this
convince
them

<EOS>
without

a
word
in
reply

or
give
them
a
look
of
reproach

he
follow
the
old
woman

into
another

He

His

still
hung
in

about

his
eye

<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
take
a

beside
him

down

<EOS>
"
You
remember
the
garden
,
Harry
,
"
whisper
the
schoolmaster
,
anxious
to
rouse
him
,
for
a
dulness
seem
gathering
upon
the
child
,
"
and
how
pleasant
it
use
to
be
in
the
evening
time
?
 
<EOS>
You
must
make
haste
to
visit
it
again
,
for
I
think
the
very
flower
have
miss
you
,
and
be
less
gay
than
they
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
come
soon
,
my
dear
,
very
soon
now
---
will
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
smile
faintly
---
so
very
,
very
faintly
---
and
put
his
hand
upon
his
friend
's
grey
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
move
his
lip
too
,
but
no
voice
come
from
them
;
no
,
not
a
sound
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
silence
that
ensue
,
the
hum
of
distant
voice
bear
upon
the
evening
air
come
float
through
the
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
the
sick
child
,
open
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
boy
at
play
upon
the
green
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
a
handkerchief
from
his
pillow
,
and
try
to
wave
it
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
feeble
arm
drop
powerless
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
do
it
?
"
say
the
schoolmaster
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
wave
it
at
the
window
,
"
be
the
faint
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
tie
it
to
the
lattice
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
may
see
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
will
think
of
me
,
and
look
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
raise
his
head
,
and
glance
from
the
flutter
signal
to
his
idle
bat
,
that
lie
with
slate
and
book
and
other
boyish
property
upon
a
table
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
lay
him
softly
down
once
more
,
and
ask
if
the
little
girl
be
there
,
for
he
could
not
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
step
forward
,
and
press
the
passive
hand
that
lie
upon
the
coverlet
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
old
friend
and
companion
---
for
such
they
be
,
though
they
be
man
and
child
---
hold
each
other
in
a
long
embrace
,
and
then
the
little
scholar
turn
his
face
towards
the
wall
,
and
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
schoolmaster
sit
in
the
same
place
,
hold
the
small
cold
hand
in
his
,
and
chafe
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
but
the
hand
of
a
dead
child
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
;
and
yet
he
chafe
it
still

and

Chapter
26
    
almost
break
-
hearted
<EOS>
,
Nell
withdraw
with
the
schoolmaster
from
the
bedside
and
return
to
his
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
and
tear
she
be
yet
careful
to
conceal
their
real
cause
from
the
old
man
,
for
the
dead
boy
have
be
a
grandchild
,
and
leave
but
one
aged
relative
to
mourn
his
premature
decay
.
  
<EOS>
She
steal
away
to
bed
as
quickly
as
she
could
,
and
when
she
be
alone
,
give
free
vent
to
the
sorrow
with
which
her
breast
be
overcharge
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
sad
scene
she
have
witness
,
be
not
without
its
lesson
of
content
and
gratitude
;
of
content
with
the
lot
which
leave
her
health
and
freedom
;
and
gratitude
that
she
be
spare
to
the
one
relative
and
friend
she
love
,
and
to
live
and
move
in
a
beautiful
world
,
when
so
many
young
creature
---
as
young
and
full
of
hope
as
she
---
be
stricken
down
and
gather
to
their
grave
.
<EOS>
how
many
of
the
mound
in
that
old
churchyard
where
she
have
lately
stray
,
grow
green
above
the
grave
of
child
!
 
<EOS>
and
though
she
think
as
a
child
herself
,
and
do
not
perhaps
sufficiently
consider
to
what
a
bright
and
happy
existence
those
who
die
young
be
bear
,
and
how
in
death
they
lose
the
pain
of
see
other
die
around
them
,
bear
to
the
tomb
some
strong
affection
of
their
heart
(
which
make
the
old
die
many
time
in
one
long
life
)
,
still
she
think
wisely
enough
,
to
draw
a
plain
and
easy
moral
from
what
she
have
see
that
night
,
and
to
store
it
,
deep
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Her
dream
be
of
the
little
scholar
:
not
coffin
and
cover
up
,
but
mingle
with
angel
,
and
smile
happily
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
dart
his
cheerful
ray
into
the
room
,
awake
her
;
and
now
there
remain
but
to
take
leave
of
the
poor
schoolmaster
and
wander
forth
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
they
be
ready
to
depart
,
school
have
begin
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
darkened
room
,
the
din
of
yesterday
be
go
on
again
:
a
little
sobered
and
soften
down
,
perhaps
,
but
only
a
very
little
,
if
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
rise
from
his
desk
and
walk
with
them
to
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
trembling
and
reluctant
hand
,
that
the
child
hold
out
to
him
the
money
which
the
lady
have
give
her
at
the
race
for
her
flower
:
falter
in
her
thank
as
she
think
how
small
the
sum
be
,
and
blush
as
she
offer
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
bid
her
put
it
up
,
and
stoop
to
kiss
her
cheek
,
turn
back
into
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
half
-
a
-
dozen
pace
when
he
be
at
the
door
again
;
the
old
man
retrace
his
step
to
shake
hand
,
and
the
child
do
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
fortune
and
happiness
go
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
poor
schoolmaster
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
a
solitary
man
now
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
ever
pass
this
way
again
,
you
will
not
forget
the
little
village
-
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
forget
it
,
sir
,
"
rejoin
Nell
;
"
nor
ever
forget
to
be
grateful
to
you
for
your
kindness
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
such
word
from
the
lip
of
child
very
often
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
shake
his
head
,
and
smile
thoughtfully
,
"
but
they
be
soon
forget
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
attach
one
young
friend
to
me
,
the
well
friend
for
be
young
---
but
that
be
over
<EOS>
---
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
bade
him
farewell
very
many
time
,
and
turn
away
,
walk
slowly
and
often
look
back
,
until
they
could
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
at
length
they
have
leave
the
village
far
behind
,
and
even
lose
sight
of
the
smoke
among
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
They
trudge
onward
now
,
at
a
quick
pace
,
resolve
to
keep
the
main
road
,
and
go
wherever
it
may
lead
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
main
road
stretch
a
long
,
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
inconsiderable
cluster
of
cottage
which
they
pass
,
without
stop
,
and
one
lonely
road
-
side
public
-
house
where
they
have
some
bread
and
cheese
,
this
highway
have
lead
them
to
nothing
---
late
in
the
afternoon
---
and
still
lengthen
out
,
far
in
the
distance
,
the
same
dull
,
tedious
,
wind
course
,
that
they
have
be
pursue
all
day

<EOS>
as
they
have
no
resource
,
however
,
but
to
go
forward
,
they
still
keep
on
,
though
at
a
much
slow
pace
,
be
very
weary
and
fatigued
.
  
<EOS>
the
afternoon
have
wear
away
into
a
beautiful
evening
,
when
they
arrive
at
a
point
where
the
road
make
a
sharp
turn
and
strike
across
a
common
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
border
of
this
common
,
and
close
to
the
hedge
which
divide
it
from
the
cultivate
field
,
a
caravan
be
draw
up
to
rest
;
upon
which
,
by
reason
of
its
situation
,
they
come
so
suddenly
that
they
could
not
have
avoid
it
if
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
shabby
,
dingy
,
dusty
cart
,
but
a
smart
little
house
upon
wheel
,
with
white
dimity
curtain
festoon
the
window
,
and
window
-
shutter
of
green
pick
out
with
panel
of
a
stare
red
,
in
which
happily

the
whole

shone
brilliant

<EOS>
neither
be
it
a

by
a
single

or
emaciate
horse
,
for
a
pair
of
horse
in
pretty
good
condition
be
release
from
the
shaft
and
graze
on
the
frouzy
grass
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
it
a
gipsy
caravan
,
for
at
the
open
door
(
grace
with
a
bright
brass
knocker

sit
a
christian
lady
,
stout
and
comfortable
to
look
upon
,
who
wear
a
large
bonnet
tremble
with
bow
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
it
be
not
an
unprovided
or
destitute
caravan
<EOS>
be
clear
from
this
lady
's
occupation
,
which
be
the
very
pleasant
and
refresh
one
of
take
tea
.
 
<EOS>
the
tea
-
thing
,
include
a
bottle
of
rather
suspicious
character
and
a
cold
knuckle
of
ham
,
be
set
forth
upon
a
drum
,
cover
with
a
white
napkin
;
and
there
,
as
if
at
the
most
convenient
round
-
table
in
all
the
world
,
sit
this
rove
lady
,
take
her
tea
and
enjoy
the
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
at
that
moment
the
lady
of
the
caravan
have
her
cup
(
which
,
that
everything
about
her
may
be
of
a
stout
and
comfortable
kind
,
be
a
breakfast
cup
)
to
her
lip
,
and
that
have
her
eye
lift
to
the
sky
in
her
enjoyment
of
the
full
flavour
of
the
tea
,
not
unmingled
possibly
with
just
the
slight
dash
or
gleam
of
something
out
of
the
suspicious
bottle
---
but
this
be
mere
speculation
and
not
distinct
matter
of
history
<EOS>
---
it
happen
that
be
thus
agreeably
engage
,
she
do
not
see
the
traveller
when
they
first
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
she
be
in
the
act
of
get
down
the
cup
,
and
draw
a
long
breath
after
the
exertion
of
cause
its
content
to
disappear
,
that
the
lady
of
the
caravan
beheld
an
old
man
and
a
young
child
walk
slowly
by
,
and
glance
at
her
proceeding
with
eye
of
modest
but
hungry
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"

cry
the
lady
of
the

scoop
the

out

They
may
perhaps
have
carry
out
the

<EOS>
Nell
be
very
much
surprised
that
the
man
should
be
so
accurately
acquaint
with
the
weight
of
one
whom
she
have
read
of
in
book
as
have
live
considerably
before

but
speedily
forget
the
subject
in
the
joy
of
hearing
that
they
be
to
go
forward
in
the
caravan

for
which
she
thank
its
lady
with
unaffected
earnestness

She
help
with
great
readiness

alacrity
to
put
away
the

delighted

Their
patroness

shut
the

down

her
drum
at
an
open
window
;
and
,
the
step
be
strike
by
George
and
stow
under
the
carriage
,
away
they
go
,
with
a
great
noise
of
flap
and
creak
and
straining
,
and
the
bright
brass
knocker
,
which
nobody

knock
at

knock
one
perpetual

knock

heavily

<EOS>
when
they
have
travel
slowly
forward
for
some
short
distance
,
Nell
venture
to
steal
a
look
round
the
caravan
and
observe
it
more
closely
.
 
<EOS>
one
half
of
it
---
that
moiety
in
which
the
comfortable
proprietress
be
then
seat
---
be
carpet
,
and
so
partition
off
at
the
further
end
as
to
accommodate
a
sleep
-
place
,
construct
after
the
fashion
of
a
berth
on
board
ship
,
which
be
shade
,
like
the
little
window
,
with
fair
white
curtain
,
and
look
comfortable
enough
,
though
by
what
kind
of
gymnastic
exercise
the
lady
of
the
caravan
ever
contrive
to
get
into
it
,
be
an
unfathomable
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
half
serve
for
a
kitchen
,
and
be
fit
up
with
a
stove
whose
small
chimney
pass
through
the
roof
.
<EOS>
It
hold
also
a
closet
or
larder
,
several
chest
,
a
great
pitcher
of
water
,
and
a
few
cooking
-
utensil
and
article
of
crockery
.
 
<EOS>
these
latter
necessary
hang
upon
the
wall
,
which
,
in
that
portion
of
the
establishment
devote
to
the
lady
of
the
caravan
,
be
ornament
with
such
gayer
and
light
decoration
as
a
triangle
and
a
couple
of
well
-
thumb
tambourine
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
caravan
sit
at
one
window
in
all
the
pride
and
poetry
of
the
musical
instrument
,
and
little
Nell
and
her
grandfather
sit
at
the
other
in
all
the
humility
of
the
kettle
and
saucepan
,
while
the
machine
jog
on
and
shift
the
darkening
prospect
very
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
the
two
traveller
speak
little
,
and
only
in
whisper
,
but
as
they
grow
more
familiar
with
the
place
they
venture
to
converse
with
great
freedom
,
and
talk
about
the
country
through
which
they
be
pass
,
and
the
different
object
that
present
themselves
,
until
the
old
man
fall
asleep
;
which
the
lady
of
the
caravan
observe
,
invite
Nell
to
come
and
sit
beside
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
child
,
"
she
say
,
"
how
do
you
like
this
way
of
travel
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nell
reply
that
she
think
it
be
very
pleasant
indeed
,
to
which
the
lady
assent
in
the
case
of
people
who
have
their
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
for
herself
,
she
say
,
she
be
trouble
with
a
lowness
in
that
respect
which
require
a
constant
stimulant
;
though
whether
the
aforesaid
stimulant
be
derive
from
the
suspicious
bottle
of
which
mention
have
be
already
make
or
from
other
source
,
she
do
not
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
that

the
happiness
of
you
young
people

she
continue
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
it
be
to
be
low
in
your
feeling

<EOS>
You
always
have
your
appetite
too
,
and
what
a
comfort
that
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nell
think
that
she
could
sometimes
dispense
with
her
own
appetite
very
conveniently
;
and
think
,
moreover
,
that
there
be
nothing
either
in
the
lady
's
personal
appearance
or
in
her
manner
of
take
tea
,
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
her
natural
relish
for
meat
and
drink
have
at
all
fail
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
silently
assent
,
however
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
to
what
the
lady
have
say
,
and
wait
until
she
should
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
speak
,
however
,
she
sit
look
at
the
child
for
a
long
time
in
silence
,
and
then
get
up
,
bring
out
from
a
corner
a
large
roll
of
canvas
about
a
yard
in
width
,
which
she
lay
upon
the
floor
and
spread
open
with
her
foot
until
it
nearly
reach
from
one
end
of
the
caravan
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"

Nell

Nell

in
a
tone

imply

either
that

reasonably
surprised

only
Jarley

who

the
delight

the
Nobility

Gentry

the
peculiar
pet

it

provoke
her
to
further
questioning

into
any

Nell

window

her

the
driver
to
come
under
the
window
at
which
she
be
seat
,
hold
a
long
conversation
with
him
in
a
low
tone

voice

ask
his

on
an
important
point

the
pro

Mrs

take
care

yourself

ever
will

Mrs
Jarley
sharply

he
never
will

<EOS>
Mrs
Jarley
be
a
little
disconcert
by
this
reception
of
her
proposal
,
and
look
at
the
old
man
,
who
tenderly
take
Nell
's
hand
and
detain
it
in
his
own
,
as
if
she
could
have
very
well
dispense
with
his
company

even
his
earthly

<EOS>
after
an
awkward
pause
,
she
thrust
her
head
out
of
the
window
again
,
and
have
another
conference
with
the
driver
upon
some
point
on
which
they
do
not
seem
to
agree
quite
so
readily
as
on
their
former
topic
of
discussion
;

they
conclude
at
last
,
and
she
address
the
grandfather
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
really
disposed
to
employ
yourself

Mrs

there
would

a
way
with
her
that
people
would
not

unpleasant

when

Quilp
,
look
up
at
the
old
gateway

in
the
moonlight
like
some
monstrous
image
that
have
come
down
from

a

not
dare
to
move
until
they
be
out
of
sight
and
hearing
,
and
then
hurry
to
where
she
have
leave
her
grandfather
,
feel
as
if
the
very
passing
of
the
dwarf
so
near
him
must
have
fill
him
with
alarm
and
terror
.

sleep
soundly

she
softly
withdraw

<EOS>
as
she
be
make
her
way
to
her
own
bed
,
she
determine
to
say
nothing
of
this
adventure
,
as
upon
whatever
errand
<EOS>
the
dwarf
have
come
(
and
she
fear
it
must
have
be
in
search
of
them
)
<EOS>
it
be
clear
by
his
inquiry
about
the
London
coach
that
he
be
on
his
way
homeward
,
and
as
he
have
pass
through
that
place

it
be
but
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
be
safe
from
his
inquiry
there
,
than
they
could
be
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
these
reflection
do
not
remove
her
own
alarm
,
for
she
have
be
too
much
terrified
to
be
easily
compose
,
and
feel
as
if
she
be
hem
in
by
a
legion
of
Quilps
,
and
the
very
air
itself
be
fill
with
them

<EOS>
the
delight

the
Nobility

get
into

where
she
be
snore
peacefully
,
while

carefully
dispose
upon
the
drum

be
reveal
its
glory
by
the
light
of
a
dim
lamp
that

from

<EOS>
the
child
's
bed
be
already
make
upon
the
floor
,
and
it
be
a
great
comfort
to
her
to
hear
the
step
remove
as
soon
as
she
have
enter
,
and
to
know
that
all
easy
communication
between

the
brass
knocker
be
by
this
means
effectually
prevent

certain
guttural
sound

which
from
time
to
time
ascend
through
the
floor
of
the
caravan
,
and
a
rustling
of
straw
in
the
same
direction
,
apprise
her
that
the
driver
be
couch
upon
the
ground
beneath
,
and
give
her
an
additional
feeling
of
security
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
protection
,
she
could
get
none
but
break
sleep
by
fit
and
start
all
night
,
for
fear
of
Quilp
,
who
throughout
her
uneasy
dream
be
somehow
connect
with
the
wax

or

at
length
,
towards
break
of

that
deep
sleep
come
upon

fearful

the
dreaded
face
of
Quilp

<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
large
town

with
an
open

with

such
drowzy

<EOS>
this
desirable
impression

Mrs

,
who
,
lest
Nell
should
become
too
cheap
,
soon
send
the

and
keep

who

and
who
condescend

take
a
private
view
with
eight
choose
young

to
be
quite
startling
from
their
extreme
correctness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr

in
a
nightcap
and
bedgown
,
and
without
his

,
represent
the

;
and
Mary

such
a
complete
image
of
Lord

that
the
young

quite
scream
when
they
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Monflathers
,
however
,
rebuke
this
enthusiasm
,
and
take
occasion
to
reprove
Mrs
Jarley
for
not
keep
her
collection
more
select
:
observe
that
His
lordship
have
hold
certain
opinion
quite
incompatible
with
wax
-
work
honour
,
and
add
something
about
a
Dean
and
chapter
,
which
Mrs
Jarley
do
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
although
her
duty
be
sufficiently
laborious
,
Nell
find
in
the
lady
of
the
caravan
a
very
kind
and
considerate
person
,
who
have
not
only
a
peculiar
relish
for
be
comfortable
herself
,
but
for
make
everybody
about
her
comfortable
also
;
which
latter
taste
,
it
may
be
remark
,
be
,
even
in
person
who
live
in
much
fine
place
than
caravan
,
a
far
more
rare
and
uncommon
one
than
the
first
,
and
be
not
by
any
mean
its
necessary
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
as
her
popularity
procure
her
various
little
fee
from
the
visitor
on
which
her
patroness
never
demand
any
toll
,
and
as
her
grandfather
too
be
well
-
treat
and
useful
,
she
have
no
cause
of
anxiety
in
connexion
with
the
wax
-
work
,
beyond
that
which
spring
from
her
recollection
of
Quilp
,
and
her
fear
that
he
may
return
and
one
day
suddenly
encounter
them
.
  
<EOS>
Quilp
indeed
be
a
perpetual
night
-
mare
to
the
child
,
who
be
constantly
haunt
by
a
vision
of
his
ugly
face
and
stunted
figure
.
<EOS>
She
sleep
,
for
their
well
security
,
in
the
room
where
the
wax
-
work
figure
be
,
and
she
never
retire
to
this
place
at
night
<EOS>
but
she
torture
herself
---
<EOS>
she
could
not
help
it
---
with
imagine
a
resemblance
,
in
some
one
or
other
of
their
death
-
like
face
,
to
the
dwarf
,
and
this
fancy
would
sometimes
so
gain
upon
her
that
she
would
almost
believe
he
have
remove
the
figure
and
stand
within
the
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
so
many
of
them
with
their
great
glassy
eye
---
and
,
as
they
stand
one
behind
the
other
all
about
her
bed
,
they
look
so
like
living
creature
,
and
yet
<EOS>
so
unlike
in
their
grim
stillness
and
silence
,
that
she
have
a
kind
of
terror
of
them
for
their
own
sake
,
and
would
often
lie
watch
their
dusky
figure
until
she
be
oblige
to
rise
and
light
a
candle
,
or
go
and
sit
at
the
open
window
and
feel
a
companionship
in
the
bright
star
.
 
<EOS>
at
these
time
,
she
would
recall
the
old
house
and
the
window
at
which
she
use
to
sit
alone
;
and
then
she
would
think
of
poor
kit
and
all
his
kindness
,
until
the
tear
come
into
her
eye
,
and
she
would
weep
and
smile
together
.
  
<EOS>
often
and
anxiously
at
this
silent
hour
,
her
thought
revert
to
her
grandfather
,
and
she
would
wonder
how
much
he
remember
of
their
former
life
,
and
whether
he
be
ever
really
mindful
of
the
change
in
their
condition
and
of
their
late
helplessness
and
destitution
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
wander
about
,
she
seldom
think
of
this
,
but
now
she
could
not
help
consider
what
would
become
of
them
if
he
fall
sick
,
or
her
own
strength
be
to
fail
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
patient
and
willing
,
happy
to
execute
any
little
task
,
and
glad
to
be
of
use
;
but
he
be
in
the
same
listless
state
,
with
no
prospect
of
improvement
---
a
mere
child
---
a
poor
,
thoughtless
,
vacant
creature
---
a
harmless
fond
old
man
,
susceptible
of
tender
love
and
regard
for
her
,
and
of
pleasant
and
painful
impression
,
but
alive
to
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
her
very
sad
to
know
that
this
be
so
---
so
sad
to
see
it
that
sometimes
when
he
sit
idly
by
,
smile
and
nod
to
her
when
she
look
round
,
or
when
he
caress
some
little
child
and
carry
it
to
and
fro
,
as
he
be
fond
of
do
by
the
hour
together
,
perplex
by
its
simple
question
,
yet
patient
under
his
own
infirmity
,
and
seem
almost
conscious
of
it
too
,
and
humble
even
before
the
mind
of
an
infant
---
so
sad
it
make
her
to
see
him
thus
,
that
she
would
burst
into
tear
,
and
,
withdraw
into
some
secret
place
,
fall
down
upon
her
knee
and
pray
that
he
may
be
restore
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
bitterness
of
her
grief
be
not
in
behold
him
in
this
condition
,
when
he
be
at
least
content
and
tranquil
,
nor
in
her
solitary
meditation
on
his
altered
state
,
though
these
be
trial
for
a
young
heart
.
 
<EOS>
cause
for
deep
and
heavy
sorrow
be
yet
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
a
holiday
night
with
them
,
Nell
and
her
grandfather
go
out
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
rather
closely
confine
for
some
day
,
and
the
weather
be
warm
,
they
stroll
a
long
distance
.
<EOS>
clear
of
the
town
,
they
take
a
footpath
which
strike
through
some
pleasant
field
,
judge
that
it
would
terminate
in
the
road
they
quit
and
enable
them
to
return
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
,
however
,
a
much
wide
circuit
than
they
have
suppose
,
and
thus
they
be
tempt
onward
until
sunset
,
when
they
reach
the
track
of
which
they
be
in
search
,
and
stop
to
rest

<EOS>
It
have
be

now

<EOS>
the
wind
begin
to
moan
in
hollow
murmurs
,
as
the
sun
go
down
carry
glad
day
elsewhere

and
a
train

dull
cloud
come
up
against

then

then
the

fearful

shelter
beneath

the
old

hurry
along
the
high

to
find
some

they
could
seek
a

from

now
burst
forth
in

in

confuse
by

I

begin
than
I.
"
  
as
he
speak
he
draw
a
chair
to
the
table
;
and
the
other
three
closing
round
it
at
the
same
time
,
the
game
commence
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
sit
by
,
and
watch
its
progress
with
a
troubled
mind
.
<EOS>
regardless
of
the
run
of
luck
,
and
mindful
only
of
the
desperate
passion
which
have
its
hold
upon
her
grandfather
,
loss
and
gain
be
to
her
alike
.
 
<EOS>
exult
in
some
brief
triumph
,
or
cast
down
by
a
defeat
<EOS>
,
there
he
sit
so
wild
and
restless
,
so
feverishly
and
intensely
anxious
,
so
terribly
eager
,
so
ravenous
for
the
paltry
stake
,
that
she
could
have
almost
well
borne
to
see
him
dead
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
the
innocent
cause
of
all
this
torture
,
and
he
,
gamble
with
such
a
savage
thirst
for
gain
as
the
most
insatiable
gambler
never
feel
,
have
not
one
selfish
thought
!
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
the
other
three
---
knave
and
gamester
by
their
trade
---
while
intent
upon
their
game
,
be
yet
as
cool
and
quiet
as
if
every
virtue
have
be
center
in
their
breast
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
one
would
look
up
to
smile
to
another
,
or
to
snuff
the
feeble
candle
,
or
to
glance
at
the
lightning
as
it
shoot
through
the
open
window
and
flutter
curtain
,
or
to
listen
to
some
loud
peal
of
thunder
than
the
rest
,
with
a
kind
of
momentary
impatience
,
as
if
it
put
him
out
;
but
there
they
sit
,
with
a
calm
indifference
to
everything
but
their
card
,
perfect
philosopher
in
appearance
,
and
with
no
great
show
of
passion
or
excitement
than
if
they
have
be
make
of
stone
.
  
<EOS>
the
storm
have
rage
for
full
three
hour
;
the
lightning
have
grow
fainter
and
less
frequent
;
the
thunder
,
from
seem
to
roll
and
break
above
their
head
,
have
gradually
die
away
into
a
deep
hoarse
distance
;
and
still
the
game
go
on
,
and
still
the
anxious
child
be
quite
forget

now

the
somnolent
habit
of

up

hesitation

to
remain

She
therefore
take
her

aside
,

tell
him
that
she
have
still
enough
leave
to
defray
the
cost
of
their
lodging

should
stay
there

"
We

I

return
Mr

<EOS>
"
You
shall
have

accordingly
,
when
Mr

have
smoke
his
pipe
out

knock
out
the

it
carefully
in

<EOS>
Nell
and

eat
sparingly

for
both
be
occupy

reflection

the

for
whose
constitution
beer
be
too
weak

tame
a
liquid
,
console
themselves
with
spirit
and
tobacco
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
would
leave
the
house
very
early
in
the
morning
,
the
child
be
anxious
to
pay
for
their
entertainment
before
they
retire
to
bed

<EOS>
but
as
she
feel
the
necessity
of
conceal
her
little
hoard
from
her
grandfather
,
and
have
to
change
the
piece
of
gold
,
she
take
it
secretly
from
its
place

concealment
,
and
embrace
an
opportunity
of
follow
the
landlord
when

go
out

him

"
Will
you

the
change

the
child

<EOS>
Mr
James
Groves
be
evidently
surprised
,
and
look
at
the
money
,
and
ring
it
,
and
look
at
the
child
,
and
at
the
money
again
,
as
though
he
have
a
mind
to
inquire
how
she
come
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
coin
be
genuine
,
however
,
and
change
at
his
house
<EOS>
,
he
probably
feel
,
like
a
wise
landlord
,
that
it
be
no
business
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
count
out
the
change
,
and
give
it
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
return
to
the
room
where
they
have
pass
the
evening
,
when
she
fancy
she
see
a
figure
just
glide
in
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
but
a
long
dark
passage
between
this
door
and
the
place
where
she
have
change
the
money
,
and
,
be
very
certain
that
no
person
have
pass
in
or
out
while
she
stand
there
,
the
thought
strike
her
that
she
have
be
watch
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
whom
?
 
<EOS>
when
she
re
-
enter
the
room
,
she
find
its
inmate
exactly
as
she
have
leave
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
stout
fellow
lie
upon
two
chair
,
rest
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
the
squinting
man
repose
in
a
similar
attitude
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
between
them
sit
her
grandfather
,
look
intently
at
the
winner
with
a
kind
of
hungry
admiration
,
and
hang
upon
his
word
as
if
he
be
some
superior
being
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
puzzle
for
a
moment
,
and
look
round
to
see
if
any
else
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
ask
her
grandfather
in
a
whisper
whether
anybody
have
leave
the
room
while
she
be
absent
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
,
"
nobody
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
her
fancy
then
;
and
yet
it
be
strange
,
that
,
without
anything
in
her
previous
thought
to
lead
to
it
<EOS>
,
she
should
have
imagine
this
figure
so
very
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
still
wonder
and
think
of
it
,
when
a
girl
come
to
light
her
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
take
leave
of
the
company
at
the
same
time
,
and
they
go
up
stair
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
,
ramble
house
,
with
dull
corridor
and
wide
staircase
which
the
flare
candle
seem
to
make
more
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
She
leave
her
grandfather
in
his
chamber
,
and
follow
her
guide
to
another
,
which
be
at
the
end
of
a
passage
,
and
approach
by
some
half
-
dozen
crazy
step
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
prepare
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
linger
a
little
while
to
talk
,
and
tell
her
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
a
good
place
,
she
say
;
the
wage
be
low
,
and
the
work
be
hard
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
leave
it
in
a
fortnight
;
the
child
could
not
recommend
her
to
another
,
she
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
instead
she
be
afraid
another
would
be
difficult
to
get
after
live
there
,
for
the
house
have
a
very
indifferent
character
;
there
be
far
too
much
card
-
playing
,
and
such
like
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
much
mistake
if
some
of
the
people
who
come
there
oftenest
be
quite
as
honest
as
they
may
be
,
but
she
would
not
have
it
know
that
she
have
say
so
,
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
some
rambling
allusion
to
a
reject
sweetheart
,
who
have
threaten
to
go
a
soldiering
---
<EOS>
a
final
promise
of
knock
at
the
door
early
in
the
morning
---
and
"
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
do
not
feel
comfortable
when
she
be
leave
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
think
of
the
figure
steal
through
the
passage
down
stair
;
and
what
the
girl
have
say
do
not
tend
to
reassure
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
very
ill
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
get
their
living
by
rob
and
murder
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
who
could
tell
?
  
<EOS>
reason
herself
out
of
these
fear
,
or
lose
sight
of
them
for
a
little
while
,
there
come
the
anxiety
to
which
the
adventure
of
the
night
give
rise
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
old
passion
awaken
again
in
her
grandfather
's
breast
,
and
to
what
further
distraction
it
may
tempt
him
Heaven
only
know
.
 
<EOS>
what
fear
their
absence
may
have
occasion
already
!
 
<EOS>
person
may
be
seek
for
them
even
then
.
<EOS>
Would
they
be
forgive
in
the
morning
,
or
turn
adrift
again
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
have
they
stop
in
that
strange
place
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
,
under
any
circumstance
,
to
have
go
on
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
sleep
gradually
steal
upon
her
---
a
broken
,
fitful
sleep
,
trouble
by
dream
of
fall
from
high
tower
,
and
wake
with
a
start
and
in
great
terror
.
 
<EOS>
a
deep
slumber
follow
this
---
and
then
---
what
!
 
<EOS>
that
figure
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
a
figure
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
she
have
draw
up
the
blind
to
admit
the
light
when
it
should
be
dawn
,
and
there
,
between
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
the
dark
casement
,
it
crouch
and
slink
along
,
grope
its
way
with
noiseless
hand
,
and
steal
round
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
voice
to
cry
for
help
,
no
power
to
move
,
but
lie
still
,
watch
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
it
come
---
on
,
silently
and
stealthily
,
to
the
bed
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
breath
so
near
her
pillow
,
that
she
shrink
back
into
it
,
lest
those
wander
hand
should
light
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
back
again
it
steal
to
the
window
---
then
turn
its
head
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
dark
form
be
a
mere
blot
upon
the
light
darkness
of
the
room
,
but
she
see
the
turning
of
the
head
,
and
feel
and
know
how
the
eye
look
and
the
ear
listen
.
 
<EOS>
there
it
remain
,
motionless
as
she
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
still
keep
the
face
towards
her
,
it
busy
its
hand
in
something
,
and
she

the
chink
of
money

<EOS>
then
,
on
it
come
again
,
silent
and
stealthy
as
before
,
and
replace
the
garment
it
have
take
from
the
bedside
,
drop
upon
its
hand
and
knee
,
and
crawl
away
.
 
<EOS>
how
slowly
it
seem
to
move
,
now
that
she
could
hear
but
not
see
it
,
creep
along
the
floor
!
 
<EOS>
It
reach
the
door
at
last
,
and
stand
upon
its
foot
.
 
<EOS>
the
step
creak
beneath
its
noiseless
tread
,
and
it
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
impulse
of
the
child
be
to
fly
from
the
terror
of
be
by
herself
in
that
room
---
to
have
somebody
by
---
not
to
be
alone
---
and
then
her
power
of
speech
would
be
restore
.
 
<EOS>
with
no
consciousness
of
have
move
,
she
gain
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
the
dreadful
shadow
,
pause
at
the
bottom
of
the
step
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
pass
it
;
she
may
have
do
so
,
perhaps
,
in
the
darkness
without
be
seize
,
but
her
blood
curdle
at
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
stand
quite
still
,
and
so
do
she
;
not
boldly
,
but
of
necessity
;
for
go
back
into
the
room
be
hardly
less
terrible
than
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
rain
beat
fast
and
furiously
without
,
and
run
down
in
plashing
stream
from
the
thatched
roof
.
 
<EOS>
some
summer
insect
,
with
no
escape
into
the
air
,
fly
blindly
to
and
fro
,
beat
its
body
against
the
wall
and
ceiling
,
and
fill
the
silent
place
with
murmur
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
move
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
involuntarily
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
once
in
her
grandfather
's
room
,
she
would
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
It
creep
along
the
passage
until
it
come
to
the
very
door
she
long
so
ardently
to
reach
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
,
in
the
agony
of
be
so
near
,
have
almost
dart
forward
with
the
design
of
burst
into
the
room
and
close
it
behind
her
,
when
the
figure
stop
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
idea
flash
suddenly
upon
her
---
what
if
it
enter
there
,
and
have
a
design
upon
the
old
man
's
life
!
 
<EOS>
She
turn
faint
and
sick
.
<EOS>
It
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
light
inside
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
be
now
within
the
chamber
,
and
she
,
still
dumb
---
quite
dumb
,
and
almost
senseless
---
stand
look
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
be
partly
open
.
 
<EOS>
not
know
what
she
mean
to
do
,
but
mean
to
preserve
him
or
be
kill
herself
,
she
stagger
forward
and
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
what
sight
be
that
which
meet
her
view
!
  
<EOS>
the
bed
have
not
be
lain
on
,
but
be
smooth
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
and
at
a
table
sit
the
old
man
himself
;
the
only
live
creature
there
;
his
white
face
pinch
and
sharpen
by
the
greediness
which
make
his
eye
unnaturally
bright
---
count
the
money
of
which
his
hand
have
rob
her
.

Chapter

<EOS>
with
step
more
faltering
and
unsteady
than
those
with
which
she
have
approach
the
room
,
the
child
withdraw
from
the
door
,
and
grope
her
way
back
to
her
own
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
the
terror
she
have
lately
feel
be
nothing
compare
with
that
which
now
oppress
her
.
 
<EOS>
no
strange
robber
,
no
treacherous
host
connive
at
the
plunder
of
his
guest
,
or
steal
to
their
bed
to
kill
them
in
their
sleep
,
no
nightly
prowler
,
however
terrible
and
cruel
,
could
have
awaken
in
her
bosom
half
the
dread
which
the
recognition
of
her
silent
visitor
inspire
.
 
<EOS>
the
grey
-
head
old
man
glide
like
a
ghost
into
her
room
and
act
the
thief
while
he
suppose
her
fast
asleep
,
then
bear
off
his
prize
and
hang
over
it
with
the
ghastly
exultation
she
have
witness
,
be
bad
---
immeasurably
bad
,
and
far
more
dreadful
,
for
the
moment
,
to
reflect
upon
---
than
anything
her
wildest
fancy
could
have
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
should
return
---
there
be
no
lock
or
bolt
upon
the
door
,
and
if
,
distrustful
of
have
leave
some
money
yet
behind
,
he
should
come
back
to
seek
for
more
---
a
vague
awe
and
horror
surround
the
idea
of
his
slinking
in
again
with
stealthy
tread
,
and
turn
his
face
toward
the
empty
bed
,
while
she
shrink
down
close
at
his
foot
to
avoid
his
touch
,
which
be
almost
insupportable
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
a
footstep
on
the
stair
,
and
now
the
door
be
slowly
open
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
imagination
,
yet
imagination
have
all
the
terror
of
reality
;
nay
,
it
be
bad
,
for
the
reality
would
have
come
and
go
,
and
there
an
end
,
but
in
imagination
it
be
always
come
,
and
never
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
feeling
which
beset
the
child
be
one
of
dim
uncertain
horror
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
fear
of
the
dear
old
grandfather
,
in
whose
love
for
her
this
disease
of
the
brain
have
be
engender
;
but
the
man
she
have
see
that
night
,
wrapt
in
the
game
of
chance
,
lurk
in
her
room
,
and
count
the
money
by
the
glimmering
light
,
seem
like
another
creature
in
his
shape
,
a
monstrous
distortion
of
his
image
,
a
something
to
recoil
from
,
and
be
the
more
afraid
of
,
because
it
bear
a
likeness
to
him
,
and
keep
close
about
her
,
as
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
connect
her
own
affectionate
companion
,
save
by
his
loss
,
with
this
old
man
,
so
like
yet
so
unlike
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
weep
to
see
him
dull
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
great
cause
she
have
for
weep
now
!
  
<EOS>
the
child
sit
watch
and
thinking
of
these
thing
,
until
the
phantom
in
her
mind
so
increase
in
gloom
and
terror
,
that
she
feel
it
would
be
a
relief
to
hear
the
old
man
's
voice
,
or
,
if
he
be
asleep
,
even
to
see
him
,
and
banish
some
of
the
fear
that
cluster
round
his
image
.
 
<EOS>
She
steal
down
the
stair
and
passage
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
still
ajar
as
she
have
leave
it
,
and
the
candle
burn
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
her
own
candle
in
her
hand
,
prepare
to
say
,
if
he
be
wake
,
that
she
be
uneasy
and
could
not
rest
,
and
have
come
to
see
if
his
be
still
alight
.
 
<EOS>
look
into
the
room
,
she
see
him
lie
calmly
on
his
bed
,
and
so
take
courage
to
enter
.
  
<EOS>
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
no
passion
in
the
face
,
no
avarice
,
no
anxiety
,
<EOS>
no
wild
desire
;
all
gentle

tranquil
,
and
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
gambler
,
or
the
shadow
in
her
room
;
this
be
not
even
the
worn
and
jade
man
whose
face
have
so
often
meet
her
own
in
the
grey
morning
light
;
this
be
her
dear
old
friend
,
her
harmless
fellow
-
traveller
,
her
good
,
kind
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
fear
as
she
look
upon
his
slumbering
feature

but
she
have
a
deep
and
weighty
sorrow
,
and
it
find
its
relief
in
tear

"
God

say
the

softly
to
kiss
his
placid

I

well
now

that

her

once
more

she
search
her

the
old
man
be
ready
,
and
in
a
few
second
they
be
on
their
road
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
think
he
rather
avoid
her
eye
,
and
appear
to
expect
that
she
would
tell
him
of
her
loss
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
she
must
do
that
,
or
he
may
suspect
the
truth

<EOS>
"
Grandfather

she
say
in
a
tremulous
voice

after
they
have
walk
about
a
mile
in
silence

Mrs

's
wrath
on
first
learning
that
she

with
the
indignity
of
Stocks

Penance
,
pass
all

<EOS>
the
genuine
and
only
Jarley
expose
to
public
scorn
,
jeer
by
child
,
and
flout
by
beadle
!
 
<EOS>
the
delight
of
the
Nobility
and
Gentry
shorn
of
a
bonnet
which
a
Lady
Mayoress
may
have
sigh
to
wear
,
and
array
in
a
white
sheet
as
a
spectacle
of
mortification
and
humility
!
 
<EOS>
and
Miss
Monflathers
,
the
audacious
creature
who
presume
,
even
in
the
dim
and
remotest
distance
of
her
imagination
,
to
conjure
up
the
degrading
picture
,
"
I
be
a'most
inclined
,
"
say
Mrs
Jarley
,
burst
with
the
fulness
of
her
anger
and
the
weakness
of
her
mean
of
revenge
,
"
to
turn
atheist
when
I
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
instead
of
adopt
this
course
of
retaliation
,
Mrs
Jarley
,
on
second
thought
,
bring
out
the
suspicious
bottle
,
and
order
glass
to
be
set
forth
upon
her
favourite
drum
,
and
sink
into
a
chair
behind
it
,
call
her
satellite
about
her
,
and
to
them
several
time
recount
,
word
for
word
,
the
affront
she
have
receive
.
 
<EOS>
this
done
,
she
beg
them
in
a
kind
of
deep
despair
to
drink
;
then
laugh
,
then
cry
,
then
take
a
little
sip
herself
,
then
laugh
and
cry
again
,
and
take
a
little
more
;
and
so
,
by
degree
,
the
worthy
lady
go
on
,
increase
in
smile
and
decrease
in
tear
,
until
at
last
she
could
not
laugh
enough
at
Miss
Monflathers
,
who
,
from
be
an
object
of
dire
vexation
,
become
one
of
sheer
ridicule
and
absurdity
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
which
of
us
be
good
off
,
I
wonder
,
"
quoth
Mrs
Jarley
,
"
she
or
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
talk
,
when
all
be
say
and
do

and
if
she
talk
of
me
in
the
stock
,
why
I
can
talk
of
her
in
the
stock
,
which
be
a
good
deal
funny
if
we
come
to
that

<EOS>
Lord
,
what
do
it
matter
,
after
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
have
arrive
at
this
comfortable
frame
of
mind
(
to
which
she
have
be
greatly
assist
by
certain
short
interjectional
remark
of
the
philosophical
George
)
,
Mrs
Jarley
console
Nell
with
many
kind
word
,
and
request
as
a
personal
favour
that
whenever
she
think
of
Miss
Monflathers
,
she
would
do
nothing
else
but
laugh
at
her
,
all
the
day
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
so
end
Mrs
Jarley
's
wrath
,
which
subside
long
before
the
go
down
of
the
sun

<EOS>
Nell
's
anxiety
,
however
,
be
of
a
deep
kind
,
and
the
check
they
impose
upon
her
cheerfulness
be
not

easily
remove

<EOS>
that
evening
,
as
she
have
dread
,
her
grandfather
steal
away
,
and
do
not
come
back
until
the
night
be
far
spend
.
 
<EOS>
wear
out
as
she
be
,
and
fatigue
in
mind
and
body
,
she
sit
up
alone
,
count
the
minute
,
until
he
return
---
penniless
,
break
-
spirited
,
and
wretched
,
but
still
hotly
bent
upon
his
infatuation
.
  
<EOS>
"
get
me
money

"
he
say
wildly
,
as
they
part
for
the
night

<EOS>
"
I
must

Nell

<EOS>
It

all
the

must
be
mine

not

to
use

<EOS>
Remember
,
Nell
,
to
use
for
thee
!
"
  
<EOS>
what
could
the
child
do
with
the
knowledge
she
have
,
but
give
him
every
penny
that
come
into
her
hand
,
lest
he
should
be
tempt
on
to
rob
their
benefactress
?
 
<EOS>
if
she
tell
the
truth
(
so
think
the
child
)
<EOS>
he
would
be
treat
as
a
madman
;
if
she
do
not
supply
him
with
money
,
he
would
supply
himself
;
supply
him
<EOS>
,
she
feed
the
fire
that
burn
him
up
,
and
put
him
perhaps
beyond
recovery
.
<EOS>
distract
by
these
thought
,
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
the
sorrow
which
she
dare
not
tell
,
torture
by
a
crowd
of
apprehension
whenever
the
old
man
be
absent
,
and
dread
alike
his
stay
and
his
return
,
the
colour
forsook
her
cheek
,
her
eye
grow
dim
,
and
her
heart
be
oppress
and
heavy
.
 
<EOS>
all
her
old
sorrow
have
come
back
upon
her
,
augment
by
new
fear
and
doubt
;
by
day
they
be
ever
present
to
her
mind
;
by
night
they
hover
round
her
pillow
,
and
haunt
her
in
dream
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
,
in
the
midst
of
her
affliction
,
she
should
often
revert
to
that
sweet
young
lady
of
whom
she
have
only
catch
a
hasty
glance
,
but
whose
sympathy
,
express
in
one
slight
brief
action
,
dwell
in
her
memory
like
the
kindness
of
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
often
think
,
if
she
have
such
a
friend
as
that
to
whom
to
tell
her
griefs
,
how
much
light
her
heart
would
be
---
that
if
she
be
but
free
to
hear
that
voice
,
she
would
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
wish
that
she
be
something
well
,
that
she
be
not
quite
so
poor
and
humble
,
that
she
dare
address
her
without
fear
a
repulse
;
and
then
feel
that
there
be
an
immeasurable
distance
between
them
,
and
have
no
hope
that
the
young
lady
thought
of
her
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
holiday
-
time
at
the
school
,
and
the
young
lady
have
go
home
,
and
Miss
Monflathers
be
report
to
be
flourish
in
London
,
and
damage
the
heart
of
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
but
nobody
say
anything
about
Miss
Edwards
,
whether
she
have
go
home
,
or
whether
she
have
any
home
to
go
to
,
whether
she
be
still
at
the
school
,
or
anything
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
evening
,
as
Nell
be
return
from
a
lonely
walk
,
she
happen
to
pass
the
inn
where
the
stage
-
coach
stop
,
just
as
one
drive
up
,
and
there
be
the
beautiful
girl
she
so
well
remember
,
press
forward
to
embrace
a
young
child
whom
they
be
help
down
from
the
roof
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
this
be
her
sister
,
her
little
sister
,
much
young
than
Nell
,
whom
she
have
not
see
(
so
the
story
go
afterwards
)
for
five
year
,
and
to
bring
whom
to
that
place
on
a
short
visit
,
she
have
be
save
her
poor
mean
all
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
Nell
feel
as
if
her
heart
would
break
when
she
see
them
meet
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
a
little
apart
from
the
knot
of
people
who
have
congregate
about
the
coach
,
and
fall
upon
each
other
's
neck
,
and
sob
,
and
weep
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Their
plain
and
simple
dress
,
the
distance
which
the
child
have
come
alone
,
their
agitation
and
delight
,
and
the
tear
they
shed
,
would
have
tell
their
history
by
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
They
become
a
little
more
composed
in
a
short
time
,
and
go
away
,
not
so
much
hand
in
hand
as
cling
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
sure
you
be
happy
,
sister
?
"
say
the
child
as
they
pass
where
Nell
be
stand
.
 
<EOS>
"
quite
happy
now
,
"
she
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
always
?
"
say
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
sister
,
why
do
you
turn
away
your
face
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nell
could
not
help
follow
at
a
little
distance
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
to
the
house
of
an
old
nurse
,
where
the
eld
sister
have
engage
a
bed
-
room
for
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
to
you
early
every
morning
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
we
can
be
together
all
the
day
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
why
not
at
night
-
time
too
?
 
<EOS>
dear
sister
,
would
they
be
angry
with
you
for
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
why
be
the
eye
of
little
Nell
wet
,
that
night
,
with
tear
like
those
of
the
two
sister
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
she
bear
a
grateful
heart
because
they
have
meet
,
and
feel
it
pain
to
think
that
they
would
shortly
part
?
 
<EOS>
let
us
not
believe
that
any
selfish
reference
---
unconscious
though
it
may
have
be
---
to
her
own
trial
awake
this
sympathy
,
but
thank
God
that
the
innocent
joy
of
other
can
strongly
move
us
,
and
that
we
,
even
in
our
fall
nature
,
have
one
source
of
pure
emotion
which
must
be
prize
in
Heaven
!
  
<EOS>
by
morning
's
cheerful
glow
,
but
oftener
still
by
evening
's
gentle
light
,
the
child
,
with
a
respect
for
the
short
and
happy
intercourse
of
these
two
sister
which
forbid
her
to
approach
and
say
a
thankful
word
,
although
she
yearn
to
do
so
,
follow
them
at
a
distance
in
their
walk
and
ramble
,
stop
when
they
stop
,
sit
on
the
grass
when
they
sit
down
,
rise
when
they
go
on
,
and
feel
it
a
companionship
and
delight
to
be
so
near
them
.
 
<EOS>
Their
evening
walk
be
by
a
river
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
every
night
,
the
child
be
too
,
unseen
by
them
,
unthought
of
,
unregarded
;
but
feel
as
if
they
be
her
friend
,
as
if
they
have
confidence
and
trust
together
,
as
if
her
load
be
lighten
and
less
hard
to
bear
;
as
if
they
mingle
their
sorrow
,
and
find
mutual
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
weak
fancy
perhaps
,
the
childish
fancy
of
a
young
and
lonely
creature
;
but
night
after
night
,
and
still
the
sister
loiter
in
the
same
place
,
and
still
the
child
follow
with
a
mild
and
softened
heart
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
much
startled
,
on
return
home
one
night
,
to
find
that
Mrs
Jarley
have
command
an
announcement
to
be
prepare
,
to
the
effect
that
the
stupendous
collection
would
only
remain
in
its
present
quarter
one
day
longer
;
in
fulfilment
of
which
threat
(
for
all

well
known
to
be
irrevocable
and
most
exact
)
,
the
stupendous
collection

up
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
be

Mrs

wherein
it

that

"

upon

and
order
the

but
the
first

inasmuch

thus
,
notwithstanding
that
a
great
many
people
continue
to
stare
at
the
entry
and
the
figure
therein
display

and
remain
there
with
great
perseverance
,
by
the
hour
at
a
time

to
hear
the
barrel

organ
play
and
to

and
notwithstanding
that
they
be
kind
enough
to
recommend
their

to

until

on

clean
up
and
put
in
motion
,
so
that
the
figure
shake
its

paralytically
all
day
long

to
the
great
admiration
of
a
drunken

but
very
Protestant

barber

paralytic
motion
as
typical

protest
aloud
that

<EOS>
Miss

a
lady
of
thirty

five

thereabout

of
a
gaunt

bony
figure

and
a
resolute
bearing
,
which
if
it
repress
the
soft
emotion
of
love
,
and
keep
admirer
at
a
distance
,
certainly
inspire
a
feeling
akin
to
awe
in
the
breast
of
those
male
stranger
who
have
the
happiness
to
approach
her
.
 
<EOS>
in
face
she
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
her
brother
,
Sampson
---
so
exact
,
indeed
,
be
the
likeness
between
them
,
that
have
it
consort
with
Miss
Brass
's
maiden
modesty
and
gentle
womanhood
to
have
assume
her
brother
's
clothe
in
a
frolic
and
sit
down
beside
him
,
it
would
have
be
difficult
for
the
old
friend
of
the
family
to
determine
which
be
Sampson
and
which
Sally
,
especially
as
the
lady
carry
upon
her
upper
lip
certain
reddish
demonstration
,
which
,
if
the
imagination
have
be
assist
by
her
attire
,
may
have
be
mistake
for
a
beard
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
,
however
,
in
all
probability
,
nothing
more
than
eyelash
in
a
wrong
place
,
as
the
eye
of
Miss
Brass
be
quite
free
from
any
such
natural
impertinencie
.
 
<EOS>
in
complexion
Miss
Brass
be
sallow
---
rather
a
dirty
sallow
,
so
to
speak

but
this
hue
be
agreeably
relieve
by
the
healthy
glow
which
mantle
in

<EOS>
Her

be
exceedingly
impressive

deep
and
rich

and
,
once

not

<EOS>
Her
usual
dress
be
a
green
gown
,
in
colour
not
unlike
the
curtain
of
the
office
window
,
make
tight
to
the
figure
,
and
terminate
at
the
throat
,
where
it
be
fasten
behind
by
a
peculiarly
large
and
massive
button

<EOS>
feeling
,
no
doubt
,
that
simplicity
and
plainness
be
the
soul
of
elegance
,
Miss
Brass
wear
no
collar
or
kerchief
except
upon
her
head
,
which
be
invariably
ornament

form

<EOS>
such
be
Miss
Brass
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
in
mind
,
she
be
of
a
strong
and
vigorous
turn
,
have
from
her
early
youth
devote
herself
with
uncommon
ardour
to
the
study
of
law
;
not
waste
her
speculation
upon
its
eagle
flight
,
which
be
rare
,
but
trace
it
attentively
through
all
the
slippery
and
eel
-
like
crawling
in
which
it
commonly
pursue
its
way
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
she
,
like
many
person
of
great
intellect
,
confine
herself
to
theory
,
or
stop
short
where
practical
usefulness
begin
;
inasmuch
as
she
could
ingross
,
fair
-
copy
,
fill
up
print
form
with
perfect
accuracy
,
and
,
in
short
,
transact
any
ordinary
duty
of
the
office
down
to
pounce
a
skin
of
parchment
or
mend
a
pen

<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
understand
how
,
possess
of
these
combine
attraction
,
she
should
remain
Miss
Brass
;
but
whether
she
have
steel
her
heart
against
mankind
,
or
whether
those
who
may
have
woo
and
win
her
,
be
deter
by
fear
that
,
be
learn
in
the
law

she
may
have
too
near
her
finger
'
end
those
particular
statute
which
regulate
what
be
familiarly
term
action
for
breach
,
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
she
be
still
in
a
state
of
celibacy
,
and
still
in
daily
occupation
of
her
old
stool
opposite
to
that
of
her
brother
Sampson
.
 
<EOS>
and
equally
certain
it
be
<EOS>
,
by
the
way
,
that
between
these
two
stool
a
great
many
people
have
come
to
the

<EOS>
one
morning
Mr
Sampson
Brass
sit
upon
his
stool
copy
some
legal
process
,
and
viciously
dig
his
pen
deep
into
the
paper
,
as
if
he
be
write
upon
the
very
heart
of
the
party
against
whom
it
be
direct
;
and
Miss
Sally
Brass
sit
upon
her
stool
make
a
new
pen
preparatory
to
draw
out
a
little
bill
,
which
be
her
favourite
occupation
;
and
so
they
sit
in
silence
for
a
long
time
,
until
Miss
Brass
break
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"

say
Miss

soften
down

It
would
have

<EOS>
"

cry
Miss

about

It
may
be
observe
in
this
place
,
lest
the
fact
of
Mr
Brass
call
a
lady
a
rascal
,
should
occasion
any
wonderment

that
he
be
so
habituated
to
have
her
near
him
in
a

capacity

that
he
have
gradually
accustom
himself
to
talk
to
her

she
be
really
a

<EOS>
and
this
feeling
be
so
perfectly
reciprocal
,
that
not

do
Mr

often
call
Miss

a
rascal
,
or
even
put
an
adjective
before
the
rascal
,

Miss
Brass
look
upon
it
as
quite
a

hearted

with

I

<EOS>
this
be
Mr

my
intimate

a
gentleman
of
good

great
expectation

who

have
rather
involve
himself
by
youthful
indiscretion

be
content
for
a
time
to
fill
the
humble
station
of
a
clerk

humble
,
but
here
most
enviable

<EOS>
what
a
delicious
atmosphere
!
"
  
<EOS>
if
Mr
Quilp
speak
figuratively
,
and
mean
to
imply
that
the
air
breathe
by
Miss
Sally
Brass
be
sweeten
and
rarefy
by
that
dainty
creature
,
he
have
doubtless
good
reason
for
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
speak
of
the
delight
of
the
atmosphere
of
Mr
Brass
's
office
in
a
literal
sense
,
he
have
certainly
a
peculiar
taste
,
as
it
be
of
a
close
and
earthy
kind
,
and
,
besides
be
frequently
impregnate
with
strong
whiff
of
the
second

hand
wear
apparel
expose
for
sale
in
Duke
's
Place
and
Houndsditch
,

a
decided
flavour
of
rat
and
mouse
,
and
a
taint
of
mouldiness
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
some
doubt
of
its
pure
delight
present
themselves
to
Mr
Swiveller
,
as
he
give
vent
to
one
or
two
short
abrupt
sniff

look
incredulously
at
the
grin
dwarf

to

<EOS>
the
dwarf
glance
sarcastically
at

brazen
friend

and
,
with
a
short
dry
cough
,
turn
upon
his
heel
to
bid
adieu
to
Miss
Sally
.
<EOS>
after
a
very
gallant
part
on
his
side
,
and
a
very
cool
and
gentlemanly
sort
of
one
on
her
,
he
nod
to
Dick
Swiveller
,
and
withdraw
with
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
Dick
stand
at
the
desk
in
a
state
of
utter
stupefaction
,
stare
with
all
his
might
at
the
beauteous
Sally
,
as
if
she
have
be
some
curious
animal
whose
like
have
never

<EOS>
when
the
dwarf
get
into
the
street
,
he
mount
again
upon
the
window
-
sill
,
and
look
into
the
office
for
a
moment
with
a
grin
face
,
as
a
man
may
peep
into
a
cage
.
 
<EOS>
Dick
glance
upward
at
him
,
but
without
any
token
of
recognition
;
and
long
after
he
have
disappear
,
still
stand
gaze
upon
Miss
Sally
Brass
,
see
or
thinking
of
nothing
else
,
and
root
to
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Brass
be
by
this
time
deep
in
the
bill
of
cost
,
take
no
notice
whatever
of
Dick
,
but
go
scratch
on
,
with
a
noisy
pen
,
score
down
the
figure
with
evident
delight
,
and
work
like
a
steam
-
engine
.
 
<EOS>
there
stand
Dick
,
gaze
now
at
the
green
gown
,
now
at
the
brown
head
-
dress
,
now
at
the
face
,
and
now
at
the
rapid
pen
,
in
a
state
of
stupid
perplexity
,
wonder
how
he
get
into
the
company
of
that
strange
monster
,
and
whether
it
be
a
dream
and
he
would
ever
wake
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
and
begin
slowly
pull
off
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
pull
off
his
coat
,
and
fold
it
up
with
great
elaboration
,
stare
at
Miss
Sally
all
the
time
;
then
put
on
a
blue
jacket
with
a
double
row
of
gilt
button
,
which
he
have
originally
order
for
aquatic
expedition
,
but
have
bring
with
him
that
morning
for
office
purpose
;
and
,
still
keep
his
eye
upon
her
,
suffer
himself
to
drop
down
silently
upon
Mr
Brass
's
stool
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
undergo
a
relapse
,
and
become
powerless
again
,
rest
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,
and
open
his
eye
so
wide
,
that
it
appear
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
could
ever
close
them
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
look
so
long
that
he
could
see
nothing
,
Dick
take
his
eye
off
the
fair
object
of
his
amazement
,
turn
over
the
leave
of
the
draft
he
be
to
copy
,
dip
his
pen
into
the
inkstand
,
and
at
last
,
and
by
slow
approach
,
begin
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
write
half
-
a
-
dozen
word
when
,
reach
over
to
the
inkstand
to
take
a
fresh
dip
<EOS>
,
he
happen
to
raise
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
intolerable
brown
head
-
dress
---
there
be
the
green
gown
---
there
,
in
short
,
be
Miss
Sally
Brass
,
array
in
all
her
charm
,
and
more
tremendous
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
this
happen
so
often
,
that
Mr
Swiveller
by
degree
begin
to
feel
strange
influence
creep
over
him
---
horrible
desire
to
annihilate
this
Sally
Brass
---
mysterious
prompting
to
knock
her
head
-
dress
off
and
try
how
she
look
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
large
ruler
on
the
table
;
a
large
,
black
,
shine
ruler
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
take
it
up
and
begin
to
rub
his
nose
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
from
rub
his
nose
with
the
ruler
,
to
poise
it
in
his
hand
and
give
it
an
occasional
flourish
after
the
tomahawk
manner
,
the
transition
be
easy
and
natural
.
 
<EOS>
in
some
of
these
flourish
it
go
close
to
Miss
Sally
's
head
;
the
ragged
edge
of
the
head
-
dress
flutter
with
the
wind
it
raise
;
advance
it
but
an
inch
,
and
that
great
brown
knot
be
on
the
ground
:
yet
still
the
unconscious
maiden
work
away
,
and
never
raise
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
this
be
a
great
relief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
thing
to
write
doggedly
and
obstinately
until
he
be
desperate
,
and
then
snatch
up
the
ruler
and
whirl
it
about
the
brown
head
-
dress
with
the
consciousness
that
he
could
have
it
off
if
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
thing
to
draw
it
back
,
and
rub
his
nose
very
hard
with
it
,
if
he
think
Miss
Sally
be
go
to
look
up
,
and
to
recompense
himself
with
more
hardy
flourish
when
he
find
she
be
still
absorb
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
Mr
Swiveller
calm
the
agitation
of
his
feeling
,
until
his
application
to
the
ruler
become
less
fierce
and
frequent
,
and
he
could
even
write
as
many
as
half
-
a
-
dozen
consecutive
line
without
have
recourse
to
it
---
which
be
a
great
victory
.

Fred

dismiss

reflection

which
be
no

very
profound
,
and
be
indeed
not
altogether
unknown
in
certain
system
of
moral
philosophy
,
Mr
Swiveller
shake
off
his
despondency
and
assume
the
cheerful
ease
of
an
irresponsible
clerk

<EOS>
as
a
means
towards
his
composure

possession

he
enter
into
a
more
minute
examination
of
the
office
than
he
have
yet
have
time
to
make
;
look
into
the
wig

box
,
the
book

and
ink

untie
and
inspect
all
the
paper

carve
a

device
on

table
with

lean
negligently
out

three

on
legal
errand
from
three

four
attorney
of
the
Brass
grade

whom
Mr

receive
and
dismiss
with
about
as
professional
a
manner
,
and
as
correct
and
comprehensive
an
understanding
of

<EOS>
as

the
person
not

he
pursue
his
diversion
with
perfect
composure

notwithstanding
that
he
rather
think
there

in
this

however

he
be
mistaken

for

after

have
be
repeat
with
increase
impatience

the
door
be
open

and
somebody
with

heavy
tread
go

room
above

<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
Dick
leant
over

and
descry
a
small
slipshod
girl
in
a
dirty
coarse
apron

which
leave
nothing

<EOS>
there

She

I

Dick

<EOS>
"
Miss
Sally
say
I
be
not

"

then
they
will
have
take
'em
for
a

certain

reply
the
child
with
a
shrewd
look
;
"
and
people
do
not
like

when
they
be
once

"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be

Dick
,
rise
.

"
what
do
you
mean
to
say

<EOS>
"
yes

I
do

cooking

the

<EOS>
"
I
be
housemaid
too
;
I
do
all
the
work

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Brass
and
the
Dragon
<EOS>

I
do
the
dirty
part

it

think
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
may
have
think
much
more
,
be
in
a
doubtful
and
hesitating
mood
,
but
that
the
girl
again
urge
her
request
,
and
certain
mysterious
bumping
sound
on
the
passage
and
staircase
seem
to
give
note
of
the
applicant
's
impatience
.
<EOS>
Richard
Swiveller
,
therefore
,
stick
a
pen
behind
each
ear
,
and
carry
another
in
his
mouth
as
a
token
of
his
great
importance
and
devotion
to
business
,
hurry
out
to
meet
and
treat
with
the
single
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
surprised
to
perceive
that
the
bumping
sound
be
occasion
by
the
progress
up
-
stair
of
the
single
gentleman
's
trunk
,
which
,
be
nearly
twice
as
wide
as
the
staircase
,
and
exceedingly
heavy
withal
,
it
be
no
easy
matter
for
the
united
exertion
of
the
single
gentleman
and
the
coachman
to
convey
up
the
steep
ascent
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
they
be
,
crush
each
other
,
and
push
and
pull
with
all
their
might
,
and
get
the
trunk
tight
and
fast
in
all
kind
of
impossible
angle
,
and
to
pass
them
<EOS>
be
out
of
the
question
;
<EOS>
for
which
sufficient
reason
,
Mr
Swiveller
follow
slowly
behind
,
enter
a
new
protest
on
every
stair
against
the
house
of
Mr
Sampson
Brass

thus
take
by

<EOS>
to
these
remonstrance

the

answer
not

but
when
the

be

last
get
into
the
bed

room

sit
down
upon
it

wipe
his
bald
head

<EOS>
He
be
very
warm

and
well
he
may
be

for

not
to

the
exertion
of

<EOS>
the

however

be
not

with
perfect

Chapter
35
    
Mr
Brass
on
return
home
receive
the
report
of
his
clerk
with
much
complacency
and
satisfaction
,
and
be
particular
in
inquire
after
the
ten
-
pound
note
,
which
,
prove
on
examination
to
be
a
good
and
lawful
note
of
the
Governor
and
Company
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
increase
his
good
-
humour
considerably
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
so
overflow
with
liberality
and
condescension
,
that
,
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
,
he
invite
Mr
Swiveller
to
partake
of
a
bowl
of
punch
with
him
at
that
remote
and
indefinite
period
which
be
currently
denominate
"
one
of
these
day
,
"
and
pay
him
many
handsome
compliment
on
the
uncommon
aptitude
for
business
which
his
conduct
on
the
first
day
of
his
devotion
to
it
have
so
plainly
evince
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
maxim
with
Mr
Brass
that
the
habit
of
pay
compliment
keep
a
man
's
tongue
oil
without
any
expense
;
and
,
as
that
useful
member
ought
never
to
grow
rusty
or
creak
in
turn
on
its
hinge
in
the
case
of
a
practitioner
of
the
law
,
in
whom
it
should
be
always
glib
and
easy
,
he
lose
few
opportunity
of
improve
himself
by
the
utterance
of
handsome
speech
and
eulogistic
expression
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
have
pass
into
such
a
habit
with
him
,
that
,
if
he
could
not
be
correctly
say
to
have
his
tongue
at
his
finger
'
end
,
he
may
certainly
be
say
to
have
it
anywhere
<EOS>
but
in
his
face
:
which
be
,
as
we
have
already
see
,
of
a
harsh
and
repulsive
character
,
be
not
oil
so
easily
,
but
frown
above
all
the
smooth
speech
---
one
of
nature
's
beacon
,
warn
off
those
who
navigate
the
shoal
and
breaker
of
the
World
,
or
of
that
dangerous
strait
the
Law
,
and
admonish
them
to
seek
less
treacherous
harbour
and
try
their
fortune
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
while
Mr
Brass
by
turn
overwhelm
his
clerk
with
compliment
and
inspect
the
ten
-
pound
note
,
Miss
Sally
show
little
emotion
and
that
of
no
pleasurable
kind
,
for
as
the
tendency
of
her

as
he
say
nothing
further

decline
take
the
hint

Mr

fain

go
up

together

make
a
last
effort

awaken
the
sleeper
by
some
less
violent
mean

fail
on

last
trial

must
positively
be
succeed
by
strong
measure

Mr

assent

armed
himself
with
his
stool

the
large

repair
with

the
scene

action

where
Miss

be
already
ring
a
hand

bell
with
all
her

yet
without
produce
the
small
effect

"
there
be
his
boot

Mr

very
obstinate

Richard
Swiveller

<EOS>
and
truly
,
they
be
as
sturdy

bluff
a
pair
of
boot
as
one
would
wish
to
see
;
as
firmly
plant
on
the
ground
as
if
their
owner
's
leg
and
foot
have
be
in
them
;

seem
,
with
their
broad
sol
and
blunt
toe

to
hold
possession
of
their
place
by
main
force

"
I

anything

It
would
be
an
extremely
unpleasant
circumstance

bounce
out
suddenly

Brass

<EOS>
"
keep
the
stair
clear

<EOS>
I
should
be
more
than
a
match

close
against

side

mount
on

top

stand
bolt
upright

so
that
if
the

do
make
a
rush

he
would
most
probably
pass
him
in

fury

begin
a

take
up
after
the
method
of
those
hardy
individual
who

Mr

rain
down
such

this
Mr

give
them

faithfully
as
regard
the
wish

character
of
the
single
gentleman
,
and
poetically
as
concerned
the
great
trunk
,
of
which
he
give
a
description
more
remarkable
for
brilliancy
of
imagination
than
a
strict
adherence
to
truth
;
declare
,
with
many
strong
asseveration
,
that
it
contain
a
speciman
of
every
kind
of
rich
food
and
wine

in
particular
that
it
be
of

act

require

by
clock

He
also
give
them
to

that
the

roast

sirloin
of
beef
,
weigh
about
six
pound
avoir

dupoise
,
in
two
minute

a
quarter
,
as
he
have
himself
witness

prove
by
his
sense
of
taste
;

further
,
that
,
however
the
effect
be
produce
,
he
have
distinctly
see
water
boil
and
bubble
up
when
the
single
gentleman
wink
;
from
which
fact
he
(
Mr
Swiveller
)
be
lead
to
infer
that
the
lodger
be
some
great
conjuror
or
chemist
,
or
both
,
whose
residence
under
that
roof
could
not
fail
at
some
future
day
to
shed
a
great
credit
and
distinction
on
the

of

,
and
add
a
new
interest
to
the
history
of
Bevis
Marks
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
point
which
Mr
Swiveller
deem
it
unnecessary
to
enlarge
upon
,
and
that
be
the
fact
of
the
modest
quencher
,
which
,
by
reason
of
its
intrinsic
strength
and
its
come
close
upon
the
heel
of
the
temperate
beverage
he
have
discuss
at
dinner
,
awaken
a
slight
degree
of
fever
,
and
render
necessary
two
or
three
other
modest
quencher
at
the
public

house
in
the
course

of
all
who
witness
her
performance

and
which
be
only
to
be
exceed
by
her
exquisite
manner
of
put
an
execution
into
her
doll
's
house
,
and
take
an
exact
inventory
of
the
chair
and
table
.
 
<EOS>
these
artless
sport
have
naturally
soothe
and
cheer
the
decline
of
her
widowed
father
:
a
most
exemplary
gentleman
(
call
"
old
Foxey
"
by
his
friend
from
his
extreme
sagacity
,
)
who
encourage
them
to
the
utmost
,
and
whose
chief
regret
,
on
find
that
he
draw
near
to
Houndsditch
churchyard
,
be
,
that
his
daughter
could
not
take
out
an
attorney
's
certificate
and
hold
a
place
upon
the
roll
.
 
<EOS>
fill
with
this
affectionate
and
touching
sorrow
,
he
have
solemnly
confide
her
to
his
son
Sampson
as
an
invaluable
auxiliary
;
and
from
the
old
gentleman
's
decease
to
the
period
of
which
we
treat
,
Miss
Sally
Brass
have
be
the
prop
and
pillar
of
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
obvious
that
,
have
devote
herself
from
infancy
to
this
one
pursuit
and
study
,
Miss
Brass
could
know
but
little
of
the
world
,
otherwise
than
in
connection
with
the
law
;
and
that
from
a
lady
gift
with
such
high
taste
,
proficiency
in
those
gentle
and
soft
art
in
which
woman
usually
excel
,
be
scarcely
to
be
look
for
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Sally
's
accomplishment
be
all
of
a
masculine
and
strictly
legal
kind
.
 
<EOS>
They
begin
with
the
practice
of
an
attorney
and
they
end
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
state
of
lawful
innocence
,
so
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
the
law
have
be
her
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
bandy
-
leg
or
such
physical
deformity
in
child
be
hold
to
be
the
consequence
of
bad
nursing
,
so
<EOS>
,
if
in
a
mind
so
beautiful
any
moral
twist
or
handiness
could
be
find
,
Miss
Sally
Brass
's
nurse
be
alone
to
blame
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
lady
,
then
,
that
Mr
Swiveller
burst
in
full
freshness
as
something
new
and
hitherto
undreamed
of
,
light
up
the
office
with
scrap
of
song
and
merriment
,
conjure
with
inkstand
and
box
of
wafer
,
catch
three
orange
in
one
hand
,
balance
stool
upon
his
chin
and
penknive
on
his
nose
,
and
constantly
perform
a
hundred
other
feat
with
equal
ingenuity
;
for
with
such
unbending
do
Richard
,
in
Mr
Brass
's
absence
,
relieve
the
tedium
of
his
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
these
social
quality
,
which
Miss
Sally
first
discover
by
accident
,
gradually
make
such
an
impression
upon
her
,
that
she
would
entreat
Mr
Swiveller
to
relax
as
though
she
be
not
by
,
which
Mr
Swiveller
,
nothing
loth
,
would
readily
consent
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
by
these
mean
a
friendship
spring
up
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
gradually
come
to
look
upon
her
as
her
brother
Sampson
do
,
and
as
he
would
have
look
upon
any
other
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
He
impart
to
her
the
mystery
of
go
the
odd
man
or
plain
Newmarket
for
fruit
,
ginger
-
beer
,
baked
potato
,
or
even
a
modest
quencher
,
of
which
Miss
Brass
do
not
scruple
to
partake
.
<EOS>
He
would
often
persuade
her
to
undertake
his
share
of
write
in
addition
to
her
own
;
nay
,
he
would
sometimes
reward
her
with
a
hearty
slap
on
the
back
,
and
protest
that
she
be
a
devilish
good
fellow
,
a
jolly
dog
,
and
so
forth
;
<EOS>
all
of
which
compliment
Miss
Sally
would
receive
in
entire
good
part
and
with
perfect
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
one
circumstance
trouble
Mr
Swiveller
's
mind
very
much
,
and
that
be
that
the
small
servant
always
remain
somewhere
in
the
bowel
of
the
earth
under
Bevis
Marks
,
and
never
come
to
the
surface
unless
the
single
gentleman
ring
his
bell
,
when
she
would
answer
it
and
immediately
disappear
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
go
out
,
or
come
into
the
office
,
or
have
a
clean
face
,
or
take
off
the
coarse
apron
,
or
look
out
of
any
one
of
the
window
,
or
stand
at
the
street
-
door
for
a
breath
of
air
,
or
have
any
rest
or
enjoyment
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
ever
come
to
see
her
,
nobody
speak
of
her
,
nobody
care
about
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
Brass
have
say
once
,
that
he
believe
she
be
a
"
love
-
child
"
(
which
mean
anything
but
a
child
of
love
)
,
and
that
be
all
the
information
Richard
Swiveller
could
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
no
use
ask
the
dragon
,
"
think
Dick
one
day
,
as
he
sit
contemplate
the
feature
of
Miss
Sally
Brass
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
if
I
ask
any
question
on
that
head
,
our
alliance
would
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
she
be
a
dragon
by
-
the
-
bye
,
or
something
in
the
mermaid
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
rather
a
scaly
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
but
mermaid
be
fond
of
look
at
themselves
in
the
glass
,
which
she
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
and
they
have
a
habit
of
comb
their
hair
,
which
she
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
she
be
a
dragon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
,
old
fellow
?
"
say
Dick
aloud
,
as
Miss
Sally
wipe
her
pen
as
usual
on
the
green
dress
,
and
uprose
from
her
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
dinner
,
"
answer
the
dragon
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
dinner
!
"
think
Dick
,
"
that
be
another
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
that
small
servant
ever
have
anything
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sammy
will
not
be
home
,
"
say
Miss
Brass
.
 
<EOS>
"
stop
till
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
be
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dick
nod
,
and
follow
Miss
Brass
---
with
his
eye
to
the
door
,
and
with
his
ear
to
a
little
back
parlour
,
where
she
and
her
brother
take
their
meal
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Dick
,
walk
up
and
down
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
"
I
would
give
something
---
if
I
have
it
---
to
know
how
they
use
that
child
,
and
where
they
keep
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
must
have
be
a
very
inquisitive
woman
;
I
have
no
doubt
I
be
mark
with
a
note
of
interrogation
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
My
feeling
I
smother
,
but
thou
hast
be
the
cause
of
this
anguish
,
my
---
upon
my
word
,
"
say
Mr
Swiveller
,
check
himself
and
fall
thoughtfully
into
the
client
's
chair
,
"
I
should
like
to
know
how
they
use
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
after
run
on
,
in
this
way
,
for
some
time
,
Mr
Swiveller
softly
open
the
office
door
,
with
the
intention
of
dart
across
the
street
for
a
glass
of
the
mild
porter
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
catch
a
part
glimpse
of
the
brown
head
-
dress
of
Miss
Brass
flit
down
the
kitchen
stair
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
by
Jove
!
"
think
Dick
,
"
she
be
go
to
feed
the
small
servant
.
 
<EOS>
now
or
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
first
peeping
over
the
handrail
and
allow
the
head
-
dress
to
disappear
in
the
darkness
below
,
he
grope
his
way
down
,
and
arrive
at
the
door
of
a
back
kitchen
immediately
after
Miss
Brass
have
enter
the
same
,
bear
in
her
hand
a
cold
leg
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dark
miserable
place
,
very
low
and
very
damp
:
the
wall
disfigure
by
a
thousand
rent
and
blotch
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
be
trickle
out
of
a
leaky
butt
,
and
a
most
wretched
cat
be
lap
up
the
drop
with
the
sickly
eagerness
of
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
the
grate
,
which
be
a
wide
one
,
be
wind
and
screw
up
tight
,
so
as
to
hold
no
more
than
a
little
thin
sandwich
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
everything
be
lock
up
;
the
coal

cellar
,
the
candle
-
box
,
the
salt

box
,
the
meat
-
safe
,
be
all
padlock
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
a
beetle
could
have
lunch
upon
.
 
<EOS>
the
pinched
and
meagre
aspect
of
the
place
would
have
kill
a
chameleon
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
know
,
at
the
first
mouthful
,
that
the
air
be
not
eatable
,
and
must
have
give
up
the
ghost
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
the
small
servant
stand
with
humility
in
presence
of
Miss
Sally
,
and
hang
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
there
?
"
say
Miss
Sally

<EOS>
"
yes

madam

"
be
the
answer
in
a
weak
voice

<EOS>
"
go
further
away
from
the
leg
of
mutton
,
or
you
will
be
pick
it
,
I
know

"
say
Miss

.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
withdraw
into
a
corner
,
while
Miss
Brass
take
a
key
from
her
pocket
,
and
open
the
safe
,
bring
from
it
a
dreary
waste
of
cold
potato
,
look
as
eatable
as
Stonehenge
.
 
<EOS>
this
she
place
before
the
small
servant
,
order
her
to
sit
down
before
it
,
and
then
,
take
up
a
great
carving

knife

make
a
mighty
show
of
sharpen
it
upon
the
carving

fork

<EOS>
"
do
you
see
this
?
"
say
Miss
Brass
,
slice
off
about
two
square
inch
of
cold
mutton
,
after
all
this
preparation
,
and
hold
it
out
on
the
point
of
the
fork
.
  
<EOS>
the
small
servant
look
hard
enough
at
it
with
her
hungry
eye
to
see
every
shred
of
it
,
small
as
it
be
,
and
answer
,
"
yes
.
"
  
"
then
do
not
you
ever
go
and
say
,
"
retort
Miss
Sally
,
"
that
you
have
not
meat
here
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
eat
it
up

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
soon
do

<EOS>
"
now
,
do
you
want
any
more
?
"
say
Miss
Sally

<EOS>
the
hungry
creature
answer
with
a
faint
"
no

"
 
<EOS>
They
be
evidently
go
through
an
establish
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
help
once
to
meat
,
"
say
Miss
Brass
,
sum
up
the
fact
;
"
you
have
have
as
much
as
you
can
eat
<EOS>
,
you
be
ask
if
you
want
any
more

and
you

,
"
no

"
<EOS>
then
do
not
you
ever
go
and
say
you

mind
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
,
Miss
Sally
put
the
meat
away
and
lock
the
safe
,
and
then
draw
near
to
the
small
servant
,
overlook
her
while
she
finish
the
potato
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
some
extraordinary
grudge
be
work
in
Miss
Brass
's
gentle
breast
,
and
that
it
be
that
which
impel
her
,
without
the
small
present
cause
,
to
rap
the
child
with
the
blade
of
the
knife
,
now
on
her
hand
,
now
on
her
head
,
and
now
on
her
back
,
as
if
she
find
it
quite
impossible
to
stand
so
close
to
her
without
administer
a
few
slight
knock
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Swiveller
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
his
fellow

clerk
,
after
walk
slowly
backwards
towards
the
door
,
as
if
she
be
try
to
withdraw
herself
from
the
room
but
could
not
accomplish
it
,
dart
suddenly
forward
,
and
fall
on
the
small

<EOS>
give
her
some
hard
blow
with
her
clenched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
victim
cry
,
but
in
a
subdued
manner
as
if
she
fear
to
raise
her
voice
,
and
Miss
Sally
,
comfort
herself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
ascend

hurry
on

make

Straightway
,
the
stage
would
be
set
up
in

of
Mr
Brass
's
house

the
single
gentleman
would
establish
himself
at
the
first
floor
window
;
and
the
entertainment
would
proceed
,
with
all
its
exciting
accompaniment
of
fife
and
drum
and
shout
,
to
the
excessive
consternation
of
all
sober
votary
of
business
in
that
silent

<EOS>
It

have
be
expect
that
when

both
player
and
audience
would
have
disperse

but
the

be
as
bad

for
no

Devil
dead

the
manager
of
the
puppet
and
his

summon
by

to
his
chamber

where
they
be
regale
with
strong
water
from

and
where
they
hold
with
him
long
conversation
,
the
purport
of
which
no

fathom
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
secret
of
these
discussion
be
of
little
importance

<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
to
know
that
while
they
be
proceed
,
the

without

linger
round
the
house

that
boy
beat
upon
the
drum

that

and
the

of

refuse
consolation
,
until
the
exhibitor
be
deliver
up
to
them
to
be
attend
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
,
in
short
,
to
know
that
Bevis
Marks
be
revolutionise
by
these
popular

and
that
peace

nobody

Mr

deem
it
prudent
to
pocket
his

affront

and
to
annoy
the
audience
who
cluster
round
his
door
by
such
imperfect
mean
of
retaliation
as
be
open
to
him
,

It
may
,
at

sight

be
matter
of
surprise
to
the
thoughtless
few
that
Mr

professional
gentleman
,
should
not
have
legally
indict
some
party

party

active
in
the
promotion
of

but
they
will
be
good
enough
to
remember
,
<EOS>
that
as
doctor
seldom
take
their
own
prescription
,
and
Divines
do
not
always
practise
what
they
preach
,
so
lawyer
be
shy
of
meddle
with
the
Law
on
their
own
account
:
know
it
to
be
an
edge
tool
of
uncertain
application
,
very
expensive
in
the
working
,
and
rather
remarkable
for
its
property
of
close
shaving

for
its

what

ever
relate
such

of

as

never

<EOS>
be
there
ever
such

be

poverty
of

if
any
correct
judgment
may

from

<EOS>
and
let
me
linger
in
this
place

for
an
instant
,
to
remark
that
if
ever
household
affection

love
be
graceful
thing

they
be
graceful

<EOS>
the
tie
that
bind
the
wealthy

the
proud
to
home
may
be
forge
on
earth
,
but
those
which
link
the
poor
man
to
his
humble
hearth
be
of
the
truer
metal
and
bear
the
stamp
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
of
high
descent
may
love
the
hall
and
land
of
his
inheritance
as
part
of
himself
:
as
trophy
of
his
birth
and
power
;
his
association
with
them
be
association
of
pride
and
wealth
and
triumph
;
the
poor
man
's
attachment
to
the
tenement
he
hold
,
which
stranger
have
hold
before
,
and
may
to
-
morrow
occupy
again
,
have
a
worthy
root
,
strike
deep
into
a
purer
soil
.
 
<EOS>
His
household
god
be
of
flesh
and
blood
,
with
no
alloy
of
silver
,
gold
,
or
precious
stone
;
he
have
no
property
but
in
the
affection
of
his
own
heart
;
and
when
they
endear
bare
floor
and
wall
,
despite
of
rag
and
toil
and
scanty
fare
,
that
man
have
his
love
of
home
from
God
,
and
his
rude
hut
become
a
solemn
place
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
those
who
rule
the
destiny
of
nation
would
but
remember
this
---
if
they
would
but
think
how
hard
it
be
for
the
very
poor
to
have
engender
in
their

,
that
love
of

from
which
all
domestic
virtue
spring
,
when
they
live
in
dense
and
squalid

where
social
decency
be
lose
,
or
rather
never
find
---
if
they
would
but
turn
aside
from
the
wide
thoroughfare
and
great
house
,
and
strive
to
improve
the
wretched
dwelling
in
bye
-
way
where
only
poverty
may
walk
---
many
low
roof
would
point
more
truly

the

to
mock

in

this

be

<EOS>
It
be
no
light

<EOS>
no

---
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
in

the

<EOS>
kit
know
nothing
about
such
question

but
he
know
that
his
old
home
be
a
very
poor
place
,
and
that
his
new
one
be
very
unlike
it

yet
he
be
constantly
look
back
with
grateful
satisfaction

affectionate
anxiety

often
indite
square

fold
letter
to
his

enclose
a

eighteenpence

such

small
remittance

which
Mr

liberality
enable
him
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
be
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
have
leisure
to
call
upon
her
,
and
then
great
be
the
joy
and
pride
of
Kit
's
mother
,
and
extremely
noisy
the
satisfaction
of
little
Jacob
and
the
baby
,
and
cordial
the
congratulation
of
the
whole
court
,
who
listen
with
admire
ear
to
the
account
of
Abel
Cottage
,
and
could
never
be
tell
too
much
of
its
wonder
and
magnificence
.
  
<EOS>
although
kit
be
in
the
very
high
favour
with
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
,
and
Mr
Abel
,
and
Barbara
,
it
be
certain
that
no
member
of
the
family
evince
such
a
remarkable
partiality
for
him
as
the
self
-
willed
pony
,
who
,
from
be
the
most
obstinate
and
opinionated
pony
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
be
,
in
his
hand
,
the
meek
and
most
tractable
of
animal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
in
exact
proportion
as
he
become
manageable
by
Kit
<EOS>
he
become
utterly
ungovernable
by
anybody
else
(
as
if
he
have
determine
to
keep
him
in
the
family
at
all
risk
and
hazard
)
,
and
that
,
even
under
the
guidance
of
his
favourite
,
he
would
sometimes
perform
a
great
variety
of
strange
freak
and
caper
,
to
the
extreme
discomposure
of
the
old
lady
's
nerve
;
but
as
kit
always
represent
that
this
be
only
his
fun
,
or
a
way
he
have
of
show
his
attachment
to
his
employer
,
Mrs
Garland
gradually
suffer
herself
to
be
persuade
into
the
belief
,
in
which
she
at
last
become
so
strongly
confirm
,
that
if
,
in
one
of
these
ebullition
,
he
have
overturn
the
chaise
,
she
would
have
be
quite
satisfied
that
he
do
it
with
the
very
good
intention
.
  
<EOS>
besides
become
in
a
short
time
a
perfect
marvel
in
all
stable
matter
,
Kit
soon
make
himself
a
very
tolerable
gardener
,
a
handy
fellow
within
door
,
and
an
indispensable
attendant
on
Mr
Abel
,
who
every
day
give
him
some
new
proof
of
his
confidence
and
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Witherden
the
notary
,
too
,
regard
him
with
a
friendly
eye
;

even
Mr

would
sometimes
condescend
to
give
him
a
slight
nod

to
honour
him
with
that
peculiar
form

I
have
find
out
his
mother
's
house
,
and
have
be
direct
by
her
to
this
place
as
the
near
in
which
I
should
be
likely
to
find
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
cause
of
my
present
myself
here
this
morning

<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
of
any
cause

the

procure
me
the
honour

visit

Sir

retort
the
stranger

"
you
speak
like
a

I
think
you

well

therefore
,
pray
do
not
sink
your

unmeaning

the
stranger

<EOS>
"
It
may
be
my
long
absence
and
inexperience
that
lead
me
to
the
conclusion
;
but
if
plain
speaker
be
scarce
in
this
part

I
fancy
plain
dealer
be
still
scarcer

speaking

my
dealing

I

will
make
amend

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Witherden
seem
a
little
disconcert
by
the
elderly
gentleman
's
mode
of
conduct
the
dialogue
;
and
as
for
kit
,
he
look
at
him
in
open
-
mouthed
astonishment
:
wonder
what
kind
of
language
he
would
address
to
him
,
if
he
talk
in
that
free
and
easy
way
to
a
Notary
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
no
harshness
,
however
,
though
with
something
of
constitutional
irritability
and
haste
,
that
he
turn
to
kit
and
say
:
  
"
if
you
think
,
my
lad
,
that
I
be
pursue
these
inquiry
with
any
other
view
than
that

and
reclaim
those
I
be
in
search
of

you
do
me
a
very
great
wrong
,
and
deceive
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
deceive
,
I
beg
of
you
,
but
rely
upon
my
assurance
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
gentleman
,
"
he
add
,
turn
again
to
the
Notary
and
his
pupil
,
"
that
I
be
in
a
very
painful
and
wholly
unexpected
position
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
this
city
with
a
darling
object
at
my
heart
,
expect
to
find
no
obstacle
or
difficulty
in
the
way
of
its
attainment
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
suddenly
check
and
stop
short
,
in
the
execution
of
my
design
,
by
a
mystery
which
I
can
not
penetrate
.
 
<EOS>
every
effort
I
have
make
to
penetrate
it
,
have
only
serve
to
render
it
dark
and
more
obscure
;
and
I
be
afraid
to
stir
openly
in
the
matter
,
lest
those
whom
I
anxiously
pursue
,
should
fly
still
farther
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
that
if
you
could
give
me
any
assistance
,
you
would
not
be
sorry
to
do
so
,
if
you
know
how
greatly
I
stand
in
need
of
it

and
what
a
load
it
would
relieve
me
from

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
simplicity
in
this
confidence
which
occasion
it
to
find
a
quick
response
in
the
breast
of
the
good
-
natured
Notary
,
who
reply
,
in
the
same
spirit
,
that
the
stranger
have
not
mistake
his
desire
,
and
that
if
he
could
be
of
service
to
him
,
he
would
,
most
readily
.
  
<EOS>
kit
be
then
put
under
examination
and
closely
question
by
the
unknown
gentleman
,
touch
his
old
master
and
the
child
,
their
lonely
way
of
life
,
their
retired
habit
,
and
strict
seclusion
.
<EOS>
the
nightly
absence
of
the
old
man

the
solitary
existence
of
the
child
at
those
time
,
his
illness
and
recovery
,
Quilp
's
possession
of
the
house
,
and
their
sudden
disappearance

be
all
the
subject

much
questioning

answer

finally

kit
inform
the

I
enter
on

board

it
matter
little
to
me
where
I

I
have
a
desperate

consenting

they
walk
into

private
closet

remain
there

in

for
some
quarter
of

<EOS>
the

have
leave

wroth
at

without

the

mention

as
a
general
truth

that
it
be
expedient
to
break
the

to
tweak
their
nose

without
express
his
concurrence
in

sentiment

Mr

after
a
few
moment
of
abstraction
inquire
which
way

,
be
inform

declare
it
be
his

he
have
no
means
of
do
so
,
otherwise
than
by
a
forcible
ejectment

and
therefore
,
drive
briskly
off
---
so
briskly
indeed
,
as
to
cut
short
the
leave

taking
between
Mr

and
his
Grand
Master

to
occasion
the
former
gentleman
some
inconvenience
from
have
his
corn
squeeze
by
the
impatient
pony

<EOS>
as
Whisker
be
tired
of
standing
,
and
Mr
Swiveller
be
kind
enough
to
stimulate
him
by
shrill
whistles
,
and
various
sporting
cry
,
they
rattle
off
at
too
sharp
a
pace
to
admit
of
much
conversation
:
especially
as
the
pony
,
incense
by
Mr
Swiveller
's
admonition
,
take
a
particular
fancy
for
the
lamp
-
post
and
cart

wheel

evince
a
strong
desire
to
run
on
the
pavement
and
rasp
himself
against
the
brick
wall

It
be
not

therefore

under
the
impression

along
with

into

stall

Mr

Mrs

forewarn
him
that
they
intend
to
make
no
deduction
for
his

unbroken
in
all
its
gigantic
grandeur
;
not

the
stock
by
the
sum
of
five
shilling
,
which
be
a
perfect
god
-
send
and
in
itself
a
fortune
;
not
only
have
these
thing
come
to
pass
which
nobody
could
have
calculate
upon
,
or
in
their
wildest
dream
have
hope
;
but
it
be
Barbara

quarter
too
---
<EOS>
Barbara

of
the
party
,
and
to
take
tea
with
Kit
's
mother
,
and
cultivate
her
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
kit
look
out
of
his
window
very
early
that
morning
to
see
which
way
the
cloud
be
fly
,
and
to
be
sure
Barbara
would
have
be
at
her
too
,
if
she
have
not
sit
up
so
late
over
-
night
,
starch
and
iron
small
piece
of
muslin
,
and
crimp
them
into

,
and
sew
them
on
to
other
piece
to
form
magnificent
whole
for
next
day
's
wear
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
both
up
very
early
for
all
that
,
and
have
small
appetite
for
breakfast
and
less
for
dinner
,
and
be
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
when
Barbara
's
mother
come
in
,
with
astonishing
account
of
the
fineness
of
the
weather
out
of
door
(
but
with
a
very
large
umbrella
notwithstanding
,
for
people
like
Barbara
's
mother
seldom
make
holiday
without
one
)
,
and
when
the
bell
ring
for
them
to
go
up
stair
and
receive
their
quarter
's
money
in
gold
and
silver
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
be
not
Mr

<EOS>
kind
when
he
say
"

well
;
"
and
be

kind
when
she
say
"
Barbara
,

yours
,
and
I
be
much
pleased
with
you
;
"
and
do
not
kit
sign
his
name
bold
to
his
receipt
,
and
do
not
Barbara
sign
her
name
all
a
trembling
to
hers
;
and
be
not
it
beautiful
to
see
how
Mrs
Garland
pour
out
Barbara
's
mother
a
glass
of
wine
;
and
do
not
Barbara
's
mother
speak
up
when
she
say
"
here

bless
<EOS>
you
,
madam
,
as
a
good
lady
,
and

a
good
gentleman
,
and
Barbara
,
my
love
to
you
,
and
here
be
towards
you
,
Mr
Christopher
;
"
and
be
not
she
as
long
drink
it
as
if
it
have
be
a
tumblerful
;
and
do
not
she
look
genteel
,
stand
there
with
her
glove
on
;
and
be
not
there
plenty
of
laugh
and
talk
among
them
as
they
review
all
these
thing
upon
the
top
of
the
coach
,
and
do
not
they
pity
the
people
who
have
not
get
a
holiday
!
  
<EOS>
but
Kit
's
mother
,
again
---
would
not
anybody
have
suppose
she
have
come
of
a
good
stock
and
be
a
lady
all
her
life
!
 
<EOS>
there
she
be
,
quite
ready
to
receive
them
,
with
a
display
of
tea
-
thing
that
may
have
warm
the
heart
of
a
china
-
shop
;
and
little
Jacob
and
the
baby
in
such
a
state
of
perfection
that
their
clothe
look
as
good
as
new
,
though
Heaven
know
they
be
old
enough
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
she
say
before
they
have
sit
down
five
minute
that
Barbara
's
mother
be
exactly
the
sort
of
lady
she
expect
,
and
do
not
Barbara
's
mother
say
that
kit
's
mother
be
the
very
picture
of
what
she
have
expect
,
and
do
not
kit
's
mother
compliment
Barbara
's
mother
on
Barbara
,
and
do
not
Barbara
's
mother
compliment
Kit
's
mother
on
Kit
,
and
be
not
Barbara
herself
quite
fascinated
with
little
Jacob
,
and
do
ever
a
child
show
off
when
he
be
want
,
as
that
child
do
,
or
make
such
friend
as
he
make
!
  
<EOS>
"
and
we
be
both
widow
too
!
"
<EOS>
say
Barbara
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
have
be
make
to
know
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
doubt
about
it
,
"
return
Mrs
Nubbles
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
a
pity
it
be
we
do
not
know
each
other
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
then
,
you
know
,
it
be
such
a
pleasure
,
"
say
Barbara
's
mother
,
"
to
have
it
bring
about
by
one
's
son
and
daughter
,
that
it
be
fully
make
up
for
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
an't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
,
kit
's
mother
yield
her
full
assent
,
and
trace
thing
back
from
effect
to
cause
,
they
naturally
revert
to
their
deceased
husband
,
respect
whose
life
,
death
,
and
burial
,
they
compare
note
,
and
discover
sundry
circumstance
that
tally
with
wonderful
exactness
;
such
as
Barbara
's
father
have
be
exactly
four
year
and
ten
month
old
than
Kit
's
father
,
and
one
of
them
have
die
on
a
Wednesday
and
the
other
on
a
Thursday
,
and
both
of
them
have
be
of
a
very
fine
make
and
remarkably
good
-
look
,
with
other
extraordinary
coincidence
.
 
<EOS>
these
recollection
be
of
a
kind
calculate
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
brightness
of
the
holiday
,
Kit
divert
the
conversation
to
general
topic
,
and
they
be
soon
in
great
force
again
,
and
as
merry
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
thing
,
Kit
tell
them
about
his
old
place
,
and
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
Nell
(
of
whom
he
have
talk
to
Barbara
a
thousand
time
already
)
;
but
the
last
-
name
circumstance
fail
to
interest
his
hearer
to
anything
like
the
extent
he
have
suppose
,
and
even
his
mother
say
(
look
accidentally
at
Barbara
at
the
same
time
)
that
there
be
no
doubt
Miss
Nell
be
very
pretty
,
but
she
be
but
a
child
after
all
,
and
there
be
many
young
woman
quite
as
pretty
as
she
;
and
Barbara
mildly
observe
that
she
should
think
so
,
and
that
she
never
could
help
believe
Mr
Christopher
must
be
under
a
mistake
---
which
kit
wonder
at
very
much
,
not
be
able
to
conceive
what
reason
she
have
for
doubt
him
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
's
mother
too
,
observe
that
it
be
very
common
for
young
folk
to
change
at
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
,
and
whereas
they
have
be
very
pretty
before
,
to
grow
up
quite
plain
;
which
truth
she
illustrate
by
many
forcible
example
,
especially
one
of
a
young
man
,
who
,
be
a
builder
with
great
prospect
,
have
be
particular
in
his
attention
to
Barbara
,
but
whom
Barbara
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
;
which
(
though
everything
happen
for
the
good
)
<EOS>
she
almost
think
be
a
pity
.
 
<EOS>
kit
say
he
think
so
too
,
and
so
he
do
honestly
,
and
he
wonder
what
make
Barbara
so
silent
all
at
once
,
and
why
his
mother
look
at
him
as
if
he
should
not
have
say
it
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
high
time
now
to
be
think
of
the
play
;
for
which
great
preparation
be
require
,
in
the
way
of
shawl
and
bonnet
,
not
to
mention
one
handkerchief
full
of
orange
and
another
of
apple
,
which
take
some
time
tie
up
,
in
consequence
of
the
fruit
have
a
tendency
to
roll
out
at
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
everything
be
ready
,
and
they
go
off
very
fast
;
Kit
's
mother
carry
the
baby
,
who
be
dreadfully
wide
awake
,
and
kit
hold
little
Jacob
in
one
hand
,
and
escort
Barbara
with
the
other
---
a
state
of
thing
which
occasion
the
two
mother
,
who
walk
behind
,
to
declare
that
they
look
quite
family
folk
,
and
cause
Barbara
to
blush
and
say
,
"
now
do
not
,
mother
!
"
<EOS>
but
Kit
say
she
have
no
call
to
mind
what
they
say
;
and
indeed
she
nee
not
have
have
,
if
she
have
know
how
very
far
from
Kit
's
thought
any
love
-
making
be
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Barbara
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
they
get
to
the
theatre
,
which
be
Astley
's
:
and
in
some
two
minute
after
they
have
reach
the
yet
unopened
door
,
little
Jacob
be
squeeze
flat
,
and
the
baby
have
receive
diver
concussion
,
and
Barbara
's
mother
's
umbrella
have
be
carry
several
yard
off
and
pass
back
to
her
over
the
shoulder
of
the
people
,
and
Kit
have
hit
a
man
on
the
head
with
the
handkerchief
of
apple
for
"
scrowdge
"
his
parent
with
unnecessary
violence
,
and
there
be
a
great
uproar
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
they
be
once
past
the
pay
-
place
and
tear
away
for
very
life
with
their
check
in
their
hand
,
and
,
above
all
,
when
they
be
fairly
in
the
theatre
,
and
seat
in
such
place
that
they
could
not
have
have
well
if
they
have
pick
them
out
,
and
take
them
beforehand
,
all
this
be
look
upon
as
quite
a
capital
joke
,
and
an
essential
part
of
the
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
what
a
place
it
look
,
that
Astley
's
;
with
all
the
paint
,
gilding
,
and
looking
-
glass
;
the
vague
smell
of
horse
suggestive
of
come
wonder
;
the
curtain
that
hide
such
gorgeous
mystery
;
the
clean
white
sawdust
down
in
the
circus
;
the
company
come
in
and
take
their
place
;
the
fiddler
look
carelessly
up
at
them
while
they
tune
their
instrument
,
as
if
they
do
not
want
the
play
to
begin
,
and
know
it
all
beforehand
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
glow
be
that
,
which
burst
upon
them
all
,
when
that
long
,
clear
,
brilliant
row
of
light
come
slowly
up
;
and
what
the
feverish
excitement
when
the
little
bell
rang
and
the
music
begin
in
good
earnest
,
with
strong
part
for
the
drum
,
and
sweet
effect
for
the
triangle
!
 
<EOS>
well
may
Barbara
's
mother
say
to
Kit
's
mother
that
the
gallery
be
the
place
to
see
from
,
and
wonder
it
be
not
much
dearer
than
the
box
<EOS>
;
well
may
Barbara
feel
doubtful
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
,
in
her
flutter
of
delight
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
play
itself
!
<EOS>
the
horse
which
little
Jacob
believe
from
the
first
to
be
alive
,
and
the
lady
and
gentleman
of
whose
reality
he
could
be
by
no
means
persuade
,
have
never
see
or
hear
anything
at
all
like
them
---
the
firing
,
which
make
Barbara
wink
---
the
forlorn
lady
,
who
make
her
cry
---
the
tyrant
,
who
make
her
tremble
---
the
man
who
sing
the
song
with
the
lady's
-
maid
and
dance
the
chorus
,
who
make
her
laugh
---
the
pony
who
rear
up
on
his
hind
leg
when
he
see
the
murderer
,
and
would
not
hear
of
walk
on
all
four
again
until
he
be
take
into
custody
---
the
clown
who
venture
on
such
familiarity
with
the
military
man
in
boot
---
the
lady
who
jump
over
the
nine
-
and
-
twenty
ribbon
and
come
down
safe
upon
the
horse
's
back
<EOS>
---
everything
be
delightful
,
splendid
,
and
surprising
!
 
<EOS>
Little
Jacob
applaud
till
his
hand
be
sore
;
kit
cry
"
an
-
kor
"
at
the
end
of
everything
,
the
three
-
act
piece
include
;
and
Barbara
's
mother
beat
her
umbrella
on
the
floor
,
in
her
ecstasy
,
until
it
be
nearly
wear
down
to
the
gingham
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
these
fascination
,
Barbara
's
thought
seem
to
have
be
still
run
on
what
kit
have
say
at
tea
-
time
;
for
,
when
they
be
come
out
of
the
play
,
she
ask
him
,
with
an
hysterical
simper
,
if
Miss
Nell
be
as
handsome
as
the
lady
who
jump
over
the
ribbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
handsome
as
her
?
"
say
Kit
.
 
<EOS>
"
double
as
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
Christopher
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
be
the
beautifull
creature
ever
be
,
"
say
Barbara
.
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
"
return
Kit
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
well
enough
,
I
do
not
deny
that
;
but
think
how
she
be
dress
and
paint
,
and
what
a
difference
that
make
.
 
<EOS>
why
you
be
a
good
deal
better
look
than
her
,
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
Christopher
!
"
say
Barbara
,
look
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
,
any
day
,
"
say
kit
,
"
---
<EOS>
and
so
be
your
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Barbara
!
  
<EOS>
what
be
all
this
though
---
even
all
this
---
to
the
extraordinary
dissipation
that
ensue
,
when
kit
,
walk
into
an
oyster
-
shop
as
bold
as
if
he
live
there
,
and
not
so
much
as
look
at
the
counter
or
the
man
behind
it
,
lead
his
party
into
a
box
---
a
private
box
,
fit
up
with
red
curtain
,
white
table
-
cloth
,
and
cruet
-
stand
complete
---
and
order
a
fierce
gentleman
with
whisker
,
who
act
as
waiter
and
call
him
,
him
Christopher
Nubbles
,
"
sir
,
"
to
bring
three
dozen
of
his
large
-
sized
oyster
,
and
to
look
sharp
about
it
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Kit
tell
this
gentleman
to
look
sharp
,
and
he
not
only
say
he
would
look
sharp
,
but
he
actually
do
,
and
presently
come
run
back
with
the
new
loaf
,
and
the
fresh
butter
,
and
the
large
oyster
,
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
then
say
kit
to
this
gentleman
,
"
a
pot
of
beer
"
---
just
so
---
and
the
gentleman
,
instead
of
reply
,
"
Sir
,
do
you
address
that
language
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
only
say
,
"
Pot
o
'
beer
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
"
and
go
off
and
fetch
it
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
in
a
small
decanter
-
stand
,
like
those
which
blind
-
man
's
dog
carry
about
the
street
in
their
mouth
,
to
catch
the
half

pence

mother
and
Barbara
's
mother
declare
as
he
turn
away
that
he
be
one
of
the
slim
and
gracefullest
young
man
she
have
ever
look
upon
.
  
<EOS>
then
they
fall
to
work
upon
the
supper
in
earnest
;
and
there
be
Barbara
,
that
foolish
Barbara
,
declare
that
she
could
not
eat
more
than
two
,
and
want
more
pressing
than
you
would
believe
before
she
would
eat
four
:
though
her
mother
and
Kit
's
mother
make
up
for
it
pretty
well
,
and
eat
and
laugh
and
enjoy
themselves
so
thoroughly
that
it
do
Kit
good
to
see
them
,
and
make
him
laugh
and
eat
likewise
from
strong
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
great
miracle
of
the
night
be
little
Jacob
,
who
eat
oyster
as
if
he
have
be
bear
and
breed
to
the
business
---
<EOS>
sprinkle
the
pepper
and
the
vinegar
with
a
discretion
beyond
his
year
---
and
afterwards
build
a
grotto
on
the
table
with
the
shell
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
baby
too
,
who
have
never
close
an
eye
all
night
,
but
have
sit
as
good
as
gold
,
try
to
force
a
large
orange
into
his
mouth
,
and
gaze
intently
at
the
light
in
the
chandelier
<EOS>
---
there
he
be
,
sit
up
in
his
mother
's
lap
,
stare
at
the
gas
without
wink
,
and
make
indentation
in
his
soft
visage
with
an
oyster
-
shell
,
to
that
degree
that
a
heart
of
iron
must
have
love
him
!
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
there
never
be
a
more
successful
supper
;
and
when
kit
order
in
a
glass
of
something
hot
to
finish
with
,
and
propose
Mr
and
Mrs
Garland
before
send
it
round
,
there
be
not
six
happy
people
in
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
happiness
have
an
end
---
hence
the
chief
pleasure
of
its
next
beginning
---
and
as
it
be
now
grow
late
,
they
agree
it
be
time
to
turn
their
face
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
after
go
a
little
out
of
their
way
to
see
Barbara
and
Barbara
's
mother
safe
to
a
friend
's
house
where
they
be
to
pass
the
night
,
Kit
and
his
mother
leave
them
at
the
door
,
with
an
early
appointment
for
return
to
Finchley
next
morning
,
and
a
great
many
plan
for
next
quarter
's
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
kit
take
little
Jacob
on
his
back
,
and
give
his
arm
to
his
mother
,
and
a
kiss
to
the
baby
,
they
all
trudge
merrily
home
together
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
40
    
full
of
that
vague
kind
of
penitence
which
holiday
awaken
next
morning
,
kit
turn
out
at
sunrise
,
and
,
with
his
faith
in
last
night
's
enjoyment
a
little
shake
by
cool
daylight
and
the
return
to
every
-
day
duty
and
occupation
,
go
to
meet
Barbara
and
her
mother
at
the
appoint
place
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
careful
not
to
awaken
any
of
the
little
household
,
who
be
yet
rest
from
their
unusual
fatigue
,
Kit
leave
his
money
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
with
an
inscription
in
chalk
call
his
mother
's
attention
to
the
circumstance
,
and
inform
her
that
it
come
from
her
dutiful
son
;
and
go
his
way
,
with
a
heart
something
heavy
than
his
pocket
,
but
free
from
any
very
great
oppression
notwithstanding
.
  
<EOS>
oh
these
holiday
!
<EOS>
why
will
they
leave
us
some
regret
?
 
<EOS>
why
can
not
we
push
them
back
,
only
a
week
or
two
in
our
memory
,
so
as
to
put
them
at
once
at
that
convenient
distance
whence
they
may
be
regard
either
with
a
calm
indifference
or
a
pleasant
effort
of
recollection
!
<EOS>
why
will
they
hang
about
us
,
like
the
flavour
of
yesterday
's
wine
,
suggestive
of
headache
and
lassitude
,
and
those
good
intention
for
the
future
,
which
,
under
the
earth
,
form
the
everlasting
pavement
of
a
large
estate
,
and
,
upon
it
,
usually
endure
until
dinner
-
time
or
thereabout
!
  
<EOS>
who
will
wonder
that
Barbara
have
a
headache
,
or
that
Barbara
's
mother
be
dispose
to
be
cross
,
or
that
she
slightly
underrate
Astley
's
,
and
think
the
clown
be
old
than
they
have
take
him
to
be
last
night
?
 
<EOS>
kit
be
not
surprised
to
hear
her
say
so
---
<EOS>
not
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
already
have
a
misgiving
that
the
inconstant
actor
in
that
dazzling
vision
have
be
do
the
same
thing
the
night
before
last
,
and
would
do
it
again
that
night
,
and
the
next
,
and
for
week
and
month
to
come
,
though
he
would
not
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
difference
between
yesterday
and
today
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
go
to
the
play
,
or
come
home
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
Sun
himself
be
weak
when
he
first
rise
,
and
gather
strength
and
courage
as
the
day
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
they
begin
to
recall
circumstance
more
and
more
pleasant
in
their
nature
,
until
,
what
between
talk
,
walk
,
and
laughing
,
they
reach
Finchley
in
such
good
heart
,
that
Barbara
's
mother
declare
she
never
feel
less
tired
or
in
well
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
say
kit
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
have
be
silent
all
the
way
,
but
she
say
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
poor
little
Barbara
!
<EOS>
She
be
very
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
at
home
in
such
good
time
that
Kit
have
rub
down
the
pony
and
make
him
as
spruce
as
a
race
-
horse
,
before
Mr

come
down
to

;
which
punctual
and
industrious
conduct
the
old

the
old

Mr

,
highly
extoll

<EOS>
at
his
usual
hour
(
or
rather
at

usual
minute
and
second
,
for
he

<EOS>
Mr

this
be
not

pleasant
of

<EOS>
on
a
fine
day
they
be
quite

party
;
the

else

do
at

at
this

Mr

exert
his

to
enchant
his
entertainer

and
impress
them
with
a
conviction
of
the
mental
superiority

those

with

view
he
lead
the

to
the
small
scandal

the
day

justly
consider
by

he
be
in

condition
to
relate
the
exact
circumstance
of
the
difference
between
the
Marquis

Mizzler

Lord

which
it
appear
originate
in
a
dispute

of
champagne

and
not
in
a
pigeon

as
erroneously
report
in

neither

which
it
appear

neither

It

its

by
the
condition
of
his

which
,
if
their
gross
amount
be
but
small

comprise
a
still
small
number
of
hearer

<EOS>
among
these
be
kit
's
mother
,
who
,
find
it
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
to
keep
her
eye
open
after
the
fatigue
of
last
night
,
and
feel
their
inclination
to
close
strongly
back
and
second
by
the
argument
of
the
preacher
,
have
yield
to
the
drowsiness
that
overpower
her
,
and
fall
asleep
;
though
not
so
soundly
but
that
she
could
,
from
time
to
time
,
utter
a
slight
and
almost
inaudible
groan
,
as
if
in
recognition
of
the
orator
's
doctrine
.
<EOS>
the
baby
in
her
arm
be
as
fast
asleep
as
she
;
and
little
Jacob
,
whose
youth
prevent
him
from
recognise
in
this
prolong
spiritual
nourishment
anything
half
as
interesting
as
oyster
,
be
alternately
very
fast
asleep
and
very
wide
awake
,
as
his
inclination
to
slumber
,
or
his
terror
of
be
personally
allude
to
in
the
discourse
,
gain
the
mastery
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
I
be
here
,
"
think
kit
,
glide
into
the
near
empty
pew
which
be
opposite
his
mother
's
,
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
aisle
<EOS>
,
"
how
be
I
ever
to
get
at
her
,
or
persuade
her
to
come
out
!
 
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
be
twenty
mile
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
wake
till
it
be
all
over
,
and
there
go
the
clock
again
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
would
but
leave
off
for
a
minute
,
or
if
they
would
only
sing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
little
encouragement
to
believe
that
either
event
would
happen
for
a
couple
of
hour
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
preacher
go
on
tell
them
what
he
mean
to
convince
them
of
before
he
have
do
,
and
it
be
clear
that
if
he
only
keep
to
one
-
half
of
his
promise
and
forget
the
other
,
he
be
good
for
that
time
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
desperation
and
restlessness
kit
cast
his
eye
about
the
chapel
,
and
happen
to
let
them
fall
upon
a
little
seat
in
front
of
the
clerk
's
desk
,
could
scarcely
believe
them
when
they
show
him
---
Quilp
!
  
<EOS>
He
rub
them
twice
or
thrice
,
but
still
they
insist
that
Quilp
be
there
,
and
there
indeed
he
be
,
sit
with
his
hand
upon
his
knee
,
and
his
hat
between
them
on
a
little
wooden
bracket
,
with
the
accustomed
grin
on
his
dirty
face
,
and
his
eye
fix
upon
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
glance
at
kit
or
at
his
mother
,
and
appear
utterly
unconscious
of
their
presence
;
still
kit
could
not
help
feel
,
directly
,
that
the
attention
of
the
sly
little
fiend
be
fasten
upon
them
,
and
upon
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
astound
as
he
be
by
the
apparition
of
the
dwarf
among
the
Little
Bethelites
,
and
not
free
from
a
misgiving
that
it
be
the
forerunner
of
some
trouble
or
annoyance
,
he
be
compel
to
subdue
his
wonder
and
to
take
active
measure
for
the
withdrawal
of
his
parent
,
as
the
evening
be
now
creep
on
,
and
the
matter
grow
serious
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
the
next
time
little
Jacob
wake
,
kit
set
himself
to
attract
his
wander
attention
,
and
this
not
be
a
very
difficult
task
(
one
sneeze
effect
it
)
<EOS>
,
he
sign
to
him
to
rouse
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
however
,
that
,
just
then
,
the
preacher
,
in
a
forcible
exposition
of
one
head
of
his
discourse
,
lean
over
upon
the
pulpit
-
desk
so
that
very
little
more
of
him
than
his
leg
remain
inside
;
and
,
while
he
make
vehement
gesture
with
his
right
hand
,
and
hold
on
with
his
left
,
stare
,
or
seem
to
stare
,
straight
into
little
Jacob
's
eye
,
threaten
him
by
his
strained
look
and
attitude
---
<EOS>
so
it
appear
to
the
child
---
that
if
he
so
much
as
move
a
muscle
,
he
,
the
preacher
,
would
be
literally
,
and
not
figuratively
,
"
down
upon
him

that
instant

<EOS>
in
this
fearful
state
of
thing
,
distract
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
kit
,
and
fascinate
by
the
eye
of
the
preacher
,
the
miserable
Jacob
sit
bolt
upright
,
wholly
incapable
of
motion
,
strongly
disposed
to
cry
but
afraid
to
do
so
,
and
return
his
pastor
's
gaze
until
his
infant
eye
seem
start
from
their
socket

<EOS>
"
if

with
that
he
walk
softly
out

He

consider
this
strong

be
somewhat
excited
by
the
circumstance
in
which
he
be
place
,
he
face
round
to

I

now

<EOS>
so
say
,
Kit
march
out
of
the
chapel
,
follow
by
his
mother
and
little
Jacob
,
and
find
himself
in
the
open
air
,
with
an
indistinct
recollection
of
have
see
the
people
wake
up
and
look
surprised
,
and
of
Quilp
have
remain
,
throughout
the
interruption
,
in
his
old
attitude
,
without
move
his

from

I

take
last
night

<EOS>
if
you
be
happy

merry
ever

you
come
here

along

that
you
be

<EOS>
More
shame
for
you

I

go
to

<EOS>
"
  
"
hush

dear

"
say
Mrs
Nubbles
;
"
you

not

what
you
say
I
know

you
be
talk
sinfulness

<EOS>
"
do
not
mean
it
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
mean
it
!
"
<EOS>
retort
Kit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
,
mother
,
that
harmless
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
be
think
great
sin
in
Heaven
than
shirt
-
collar
be
,
and
I
do
believe
that
those
chap
be
just
about
as
right
and
sensible
in
put
down
the
one
as
in
leave
off
the
other
---
that
be
my
belief
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
say
anything
more
about
it
,
<EOS>
if
you
will
promise
not
to
cry
,
that
be
all
;
and
you
take
the
baby
that
be
a
light
weight
,
and
give
me
little
Jacob
;
and
as
we
go
along
(
which
we
must
do
pretty
quick
)
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
the
news
I
bring
,
which
will
surprise
you
a
little
,
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
there
---
that
be
right

<EOS>
now
you
look
as
if
you
would
never
see
Little
Bethel
in
all
your
life
,
as
I
hope
you
never
will
again
;
and
here
be
the
baby
;
and
little
Jacob
,
you
get
atop
of
my
back
and
catch
hold
of
me
tight
round
the
neck
,
and
<EOS>
whenever
a
little
Bethel
parson
call
you
a
precious
lamb
or
say
your
brother
's
one
,
you
tell
him
it
be
the
true
thing
he
be
say
for
a
twelvemonth
,
and
that
if
he
would
get
a
little
more
of
the
lamb
himself
,
and
less
of
the
mint
-
sauce
---
not
be
quite
so
sharp
and
sour
over
it
---
I
should
like
him
all
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
you
have
get
to
say
to
him
,
Jacob
.
"
  
<EOS>
talk
on
in
this
way
,
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
,
and
cheer
up
his
mother
,
the
child
,
and
himself
,
by
the
one
simple
process
of
determine
to
be
in
a
good
humour
,
kit
lead
them
briskly
forward
;
and
on
the
road
home
,
he
relate
what
have
pass
at
the
Notary
's
house
,
and
the
purpose
with
which
he
have
intrude
on
the
solemnity
of
little
Bethel
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
be
not
a
little
startled
on
learn
what
service
be
require
of
her
,
and
presently
fall
into
a
confusion
of
idea
,
of
which
the
most
prominent
be
that
it
be
a
great
honour
and
dignity
to
ride
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
that
it
be
a
moral
impossibility
to
leave
the
child
behind
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
objection
,
and
a
great
many
other
,
found
on
certain
article
of
dress
be
at
the
wash
,
and
certain
other
article
have
no
existence
in
the
wardrobe
of
Mrs
Nubbles
,
be
overcome
by
Kit
,
who
oppose
to
each
and
every
of
them
,
the
pleasure
of
recover
Nell
,
and
the
delight
it
would
be
to
bring
her
back
in
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
only
ten
minute
now
,
mother
,
"
say
kit
when
they
reach
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
bandbox
.
 
<EOS>
throw
in
what
you
want
,
and
we
will
be
off
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
tell
how
kit
then
hustle
into
the
box
all
sort
of
thing
which
could
,
by
no
remote
contingency
,
be
want
,
and
how
he
leave
out
everything
likely
to
be
of
the
small
use
;
how
a
neighbour
be
persuade
to
come
and
stop
with
the
child
,
and
how
the
child
at
first
cry
dismally
,
and
then
laugh
heartily
on
be
promise
all
kind
of
impossible
and
unheard
-
of
toy
;
how
Kit
's
mother
would
not
leave
off
kiss
them
,
and
how
kit
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
be
vex
with
her
for
do
it
;
would
take
more
time
and
room
than
you
and
I
can
spare
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
pass
over
all
such
matter
,
it
be
sufficient
to
say
that
within
a
few
minute
after
the
two
hour
have
expire

,
Kit

arrive
at

Chapter

<EOS>
It
behove
us
to
leave
kit
for
a
while
,
thoughtful
and
expectant
,
and
to
follow
the
fortune
of
little
Nell
;
resume
the
thread
of
the
narrative
at
the
point
where
it
be
leave
,
some
chapter
back
.
  
<EOS>
in
one
of
those
wandering
in
the
evening
time
,
when
,
follow
the
two
sister
at
a
humble
distance
,
she
feel
,
in
her
sympathy
with
them
and
her
recognition
in
their
trial
of
something
akin
to
her
own
loneliness
of
spirit
,
a
comfort
and
consolation
which
make
such
moment
a
time
of
deep
delight
,
though
the
softened
pleasure
they
yield
be
of
that
kind
which
live
and
die
in
tear
---
in
one
of
those
wandering
at
the
quiet
hour
of
twilight
,
when
sky
,
and
earth
,
and
air
,
and
ripple
water
,
and
sound
of
distant
bell
,
claim
kindre
with
the
emotion
of
the
solitary
child
,
and
inspire
her
with
soothing
thought
,
but
not
of
a
child
's
world
or
its
easy
joy
---
in
one
of
those
ramble
which
have
now
become
her
only
pleasure
or
relief
from
care
,
light
have
fade
into
darkness
and
evening
deepen
into
night
,
and
still
the
young
creature
linger
in
the
gloom
;
feel
a
companionship
in
Nature
so
serene
and
still
,
when
noise
of
tongue
and
glare
of
garish
light
would
have
be
solitude
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
the
sister
have
go
home
,
and
she
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
raise
her
eye
to
the
bright
star
,
look
down
so
mildly
from
the
wide
world
of
air
,
and
,
gaze
on
them
,
find
new
star
burst
upon
her
view
,
and
more
beyond
,
and
more
beyond
again
,
until
the
whole
great
expanse
sparkle
with
shine
sphere
,
rise
high
and
high
in
immeasurable
space
,
eternal
in
their
number
as
in
their
changeless
and
incorruptible
existence
.
 
<EOS>
She
bend
over
the
calm
river
,
and
see
them
shine
in
the
same
majestic
order
as
when
the
dove
beheld
them
gleam
through
the
swollen
water
,
upon
the
mountain
top
down
far
below
,
and
dead
mankind
,
a
million
fathom
deep
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
sit
silently
beneath
a
tree
,
hush
in
her
very
breath
by
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
and
all
its
attendant
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
and
place
awoke
reflection
,
and
she
think
with
a
quiet
hope
---
less
hope
,
perhaps
,
than
resignation
---
on
the
past
,
and
present
,
and
what
be
yet
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
between
the
old
man
and
herself
there
have
come
a
gradual
separation
,
harder
to
bear
than
any
former
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
every
evening
,
and
often
in
the
day
-
time
too
,
he
be
absent
,
alone
;
and
although
she
well
know
where
he
go
,
and
why
---
too
well
from
the
constant
drain
upon
her
scanty
purse
and
from
his
haggard
look
---
he
evade
all
inquiry
,
maintain
a
strict
reserve
,
and
even
shun
her
presence
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
meditate
sorrowfully
upon
this
change
,
and
mingle
it
,
as
it
be
,
with
everything
about
her
,
when
the
distant
church
-
clock
bell
strike
nine
.
 
<EOS>
rise
at
the
sound
,
she
retrace
her
step
,
and
turn
thoughtfully
towards
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
gain
a
little
wooden
bridge
,
which
,
throw
across
the
stream
,
lead
into
a
meadow
in
her
way
,
when
she
come
suddenly
upon
a
ruddy
light
,
and
look
forward
more
attentively
,
<EOS>
discern
that
it
proceed
from
what
appear
to
be
an
encampment
of
gipsy
,
who
have
make
a
fire
in
one
corner
at
no
great
distance
from
the
path
,
and
be
sit
or
lie
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
be
too
poor
to
have
any
fear
of
them
,
she
do
not
alter
her
course
(
which
,
indeed
,
she
could
not
have
do
without
go
a
long
way
round
)
,
but
quicken
her
pace
a
little
,
and
keep
straight
on
.
  
<EOS>
a
movement
of
timid
curiosity
impel
her
,
when
she
approach
the
spot
,
to
glance
towards
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
form
between
it
and
her
,
the
outline
strongly
develop
against
the
light
,
which
cause
her
to
stop
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
if
she
have
reason
with
herself
and
be
assure
that
it
could
not
be
,
or
have
satisfy
herself
that
it
be
not
that
of
the
person
she
have
suppose
,
she
go
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
that
instant
the
conversation
,
whatever
it
be
,
which
have
be
carry
on
near
this
fire
be
resume
,
and
<EOS>
the
tone
of
the
voice
that
speak
---
she
could
not
distinguish
word
---
sound
as
familiar
to
her
as
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
turn
,
and
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
person
have
be
seat
before
,
but
be
now
in
a
stand
posture
,
and
lean
forward
on
a
stick
on
which
he
rest
both
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
attitude
be
no
less
familiar
to
her
than
the
tone
of
voice
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
her
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
impulse
be
to
call
to
him
;
<EOS>
her
next
to
wonder
who
his
associate
could
be
,
and
for
what
purpose
they
be
together
.
 
<EOS>
some
vague
apprehension
succeed
,
and
,
yield
to
the
strong
inclination
it
awaken
,
she
draw
near
to
the
place
;
not
advance
across
the
open
field
,
however
,
but
creep
towards
it
by
the
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
she
advance
within
a
few
foot
of
the
fire
,
and
stand
among
a
few
young
tree
,
could
both
see
and
hear
,
without
much
danger
of
be
observe
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
woman
or
child
,
as
she
have
see
in
other
gipsy
camp
they
have
pass
in
their
wayfaring
,
and
but
one
gipsy
---
a
tall
athletic
man
,
who
stand
with
his
arm
fold
,
lean
against
a
tree
at
a
little
distance
off
,
look
now
at
the
fire
,
and
now
,
under
his
black
eyelash
,
at
three
other
man
who
be
there
,
with
a
watchful
but
half
-
conceal
interest
in
their
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
of
these
,
her
grandfather
be
one
;
the
other
she
recognise
as
the
first
card
-
player
at
the
public
-
house
on
the
eventful
night
of
the
storm
---
the
man
whom
they
have
call
Isaac
List
,
and
his
gruff
companion
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
low
,
arch
gipsy
-
tent
,
common
to
that
people
,
be
pitch
hard
by
,
but
it
either
be
,
or
appear
to
be
,
empty
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
be
you
go
?
"
say
the
stout
man
,
look
up
from
the
ground
where
he
be
lie
at
his
ease
,
into
her
grandfather
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
in
a
mighty
hurry
a
minute
ago
.
 
<EOS>
go
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
your
own
master
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
vex
him
,
"
return
Isaac
List
,
who
be
squat
like
a
frog
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
,
and
have
so
screw
himself
up
that
he
seem
to
be
squint
all
over
;
"
he
do
not
mean
any
offence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
keep
me
poor
,
and
plunder
me
,
and
make
a
sport
and
jest
of
me
besides
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
turn
from
one
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ye'll
drive
me
mad
among
ye
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
utter
irresolution
and
feebleness
of
the
grey
-
haired
child
,
contrast
with
the
keen
and
cunning
look
of
those
in
whose
hand
he
be
,
smote
upon
the
little
listener
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
constrain
herself
to
attend
to
all
that
pass
,
and
to
note
each
look
and
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
confound
you
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
stout
man
rise
a
little
,
and
support
himself
on
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
"
keep
you
poor
!
<EOS>
You
would
keep
us
poor
if
you
could

would
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
with
you
whine
,
puny
,
pitiful
player
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
lose
,
you
be
martyr
;

I
do
not
find
that
when
you
win
,
you
look
upon
the
other
loser
in
that
light
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
plunder

cry
the
fellow
,
raise
his
voice
---
"
Damme
,
what
do
you
mean
by
such
ungentlemanly
language
as
plunder
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
speaker
lay
himself
down
again
at
full
length
,
and
give
one
or
two
short
,
angry
kick
,
as
if
in
further
expression
of
his
unbounded
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
plain
that
he
act
the
bully
,
and
his
friend
the
peacemaker
,
for
some
particular
purpose
;
or
rather
,
it
would
have
be
to
any
one
but
the
weak
old
man
;
for
they
exchange
glance
quite
openly
,
both
with
each
other
and
with
the
gipsy
,
who
grin
his
approval
of
the
jest
until
his
white
tooth
shine
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
stand
helplessly
among
them
for
a
little
time
,
and
then
say
,
turn
to
his
assailant
:

Isaac

with

never

the

hint
at

not

satisfaction

with

regale
with

sight
of
so
much
wealth

which
,
though
it
may
be
deem
by
some

an
unsubstantial

visionary
pleasure
,
be
to
one
in
his
circumstance
a
source
of
extreme
delight
,
only
to
be
surpass
by
its
safe
depository
in

<EOS>
although
Mr
List
and
Mr
Jowl
address
themselves
to
each
other
,
it
be
remarkable
that
they
both
look
narrowly
at
the
old
man
,
who
,
with
his
eye
fix
upon
the
fire
,
sit
brood
over
it
,
yet
listen
eagerly

as
it
seem
from
a
certain
involuntary
motion
of
the
head
,

twitch
of
the
face
from
time

to
all
they

give
it

I
act

why
should
I
help
a
man
to
the

perhaps
of
win
all
I
have
,
unless
I
consider
him
my
friend

It
be
foolish
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
to
be
so
thoughtful
of
the
welfare
of
other

that

my

the
gipsy
acquiesce

<EOS>
when
they
have
all
three
amuse
themselves
a
little
with
their
victim
's
infatuation
,
they
dismiss
the
subject
as
one
which
have
be
sufficiently
discuss
,
and
begin
to
talk
in
a
jargon
which
the
child
do
not
understand
.
 
<EOS>
as
their
discourse
appear
to
relate
to
matter
in
which
they
be
warmly
interested
,
however
,
she
deem
it
the
good
time
for
escape
unobserved
;
and
creep
away
with
slow
and
cautious
step
,
keep
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
,

force
a
path
through
them

the
dry
ditch
,
until
she
could
emerge
upon
the
road
at
a
point
beyond

vision

then
she
flee
homeward
as
quickly
as
she
could
,
tear
and
bleed
from
the
wound
of
thorn
and
briar
,
but
more
lacerated
in
mind
,
and
throw
herself
upon
her
bed
,
distract
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
idea
that
flash
upon
her
mind
be
flight
,
instant
flight
;
drag
him
from
that
place
,
and
rather
die
of
want
upon
the
roadside
,
than
ever
expose
him
again
to
such
terrible
temptation
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
she
remember
that
the
crime
be
not
to
be
commit
until
next
night
,
and
there
be
the
intermediate
time
for
thinking
,
and
resolve
what
to
do

<EOS>
then
,
she
be
distract
with
a
horrible
fear
that
he
may
be
commit
it
at
that
moment
;
with
a
dread
of
hear
shriek
and
cry
pierce
the
silence
of
the
night
;
with
fearful
thought
of
what
he
may
be
tempt
and
lead
on
to
do
,
if
he
be
detect
in
the
act
,
and
have
but
a
woman
to
struggle
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
bear
such
torture

<EOS>
She
steal
to
the
room
where
the

open
the
door

in

God

They

upon

more
and
more
strongly
yet

<EOS>
half
undressed
,
and
with
her
hair
in
wild
disorder
,
she
fly
to
the
old
man

bedside
,
clasp
him
by
the
wrist

rouse
him
from

face

rise
from

his

bedew
with
the
cold
sweat
of
fear

and

bend
before
the

from

garland

shade

on

off

Her
momentary
weakness
past
,
the
child
again
summon
the
resolution
which
have
until
now
sustain
her
,
and
,
endeavour
to
keep
steadily
in
her
view
the
one
idea
that
they
be
fly
from
disgrace
and
crime
,
and
that
her
grandfather
's
preservation
must
depend
solely
on
her
firmness
,
unaide
by
one
word
of
advice
or
any
help
hand
,
urge
him
onward
and
look
back
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
,
subdue
and
abash
,
seem
to
crouch
before
her
,
and
to
shrink
and
cower
down
,
as
if
in
the
presence
of
some
superior
creature
,
the
child
herself
be
sensible
of
a
new
feeling
within
her
,
which
elevate
her
nature
,
and
inspire
her
with
an
energy
and
confidence
she
have
never
know
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
divide
responsibility
now
;
the
whole
burden
of
their
two
life
have
fall
upon
her
,
and
henceforth
she
must
think
and
act
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
save
him
,
"
she
think

<EOS>
"
in
all
danger
and
distress
,
I
will
remember
that

<EOS>
at
any
other
time
,
the
recollection
of
have
desert
the
friend
who
have
show
them
so
much
homely
kindness
,
without
a
word
of
justification
---
the
thought
that
they
be
guilty
,
in
appearance
,
of
treachery
and
ingratitude
---
even
the
have
part
from
the
two
sister
---
would
have
fill
her
with
sorrow
and
regret
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
all
other
consideration
be
lose
in
the
new
uncertainty
and
anxiety
of
their
wild
and
wander
life
;
and
the
very
desperation
of
their
condition
rouse
and
stimulate
her
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
pale
moonlight
,
which
lend
a
wanness
of
its
own
to
the
delicate
face
where
thoughtful
care
already
mingle
with
the
win
grace

loveliness
of
youth

too
bright
eye
,
the
spiritual
head
,
the
lip
that
press
each
other

such
high
resolve

courage
of
the
heart
,
the
slight
figure
firm
in
its
bearing
and
yet
so
very
weak

tell
their
silent
tale
;
but
tell
it
only
to
the
wind
that
rustle
by
,
which
,
take
up
its
burden
,
carry
,
perhaps
to
some

You

for

moment

<EOS>
Thinking
,
as
she
have
think
with
great
trepidation
more
than
once
before

that
the
man
whom
she
have
see
with
her
grandfather
may
,
perhaps
,
in
their
eagerness
for
the
booty
,
follow
them
,
and
regain
their
influence
over
him
,
set
hers
at
nought
;
and
that
if
they
go
with
these
man
,
all
trace
of
them
must
surely
be
lose
at
that
spot
;
determine
to
accept
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
the
boat
come
close
to
the
bank
again
,
and
before
she
have
have
any
more
time
for
consideration
,
she
and
her
grandfather
be
on
board
,
and
glide
smoothly
down
the
canal
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
pleasantly
on
the
bright
water
,
which
be
sometimes
shade
by
tree
,
and
sometimes
open
to
a
wide
extent
of
country
,
intersect
by
run
stream
,
and
rich
with
wooded
hill
,
cultivate
land
,
and
sheltered
farm

<EOS>
now
and
then
,
a
village
with
its
modest
spire
,
thatch
roof
,
and
gable
-
end
,
would
peep
out
from
among
the
tree
;
and
,
more
than
once
,
a
distant
town
,
with
great
church
tower
loom
through
its
smoke
,
and
high
factory
or
workshop
rise
above
the
mass
of
house
,
would
come
in
view
,
and
,
by
the
length
of
time
it
linger
in
the
distance
,
show
them
how
slowly
they
travel
.
 
<EOS>
Their
way
lie
,
for
the
most
part
,
through
the
low
ground
,
and
open
plain
;
and
except
these
distant
place
,
and
occasionally
some
man
work
in
the
field
,
or
lounge
on
the
bridge
under
which
they
pass
,
to
see
them
creep
along
,
nothing
encroach
on
their
monotonous
and
secluded
track
.
  
<EOS>
Nell
be
rather
dishearten
,
when
they
stop
at
a
kind
of
wharf
late
in
the
afternoon
,
to
learn
from
one
of
the
man
that
they
would
not
reach
their
place
of
destination
until
next
day
,
and
that
,
if
she
have
no
provision
with
her
,
she
have
well
buy
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
<EOS>
but
a
few
penny
,
have
already
bargain
with
them
for
some
bread
,
but
even
of
these
it
be
necessary
to
be
very
careful
,
as
they
be
on
their
way
to
an
utterly
strange
place
,
with
no
resource
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
a
small
loaf
and
a
morsel
of
cheese
,
therefore
,
be
all
she
could
afford
,
and
with
these
she
take
her
place
in
the
boat
again
,
and
,
after
half
an
hour
's
delay
during
which
the
man
be
drink
at
the
public
-
house
,
proceed
on
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
They
bring
some
beer
and
spirit
into
the
boat
with
them
,
and
what
with
drink
freely
before
,
and
again
now
,
be
soon
in
a
fair
way
of
be
quarrelsome
and
intoxicate
.
 
<EOS>
avoid
the
small
cabin
,
therefore
,
which
be
very
dark
and
filthy
,
and
to
which
they
often
invite
both
her
and
her
grandfather
<EOS>
,
Nell
sit
in
the
open
air
with
the
old
man
by
her
side
:
listen
to
their
boisterous
host
with
a
palpitate
heart
,
and
almost
wish
herself
safe
on
shore
again
though
she
should
have
to
walk
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
,
in
truth
,
very
rugged
,
noisy
fellow
,
and
quite
brutal
among
themselves
,
though
civil
enough
to
their
two
passenger
.
<EOS>
thus
,
when
a
quarrel
arise
between
the
man
who
be
steer
and
his
friend
in
the
cabin
,
upon
the
question
who
have
first
suggest
the
propriety
of
offer
Nell
some
beer
,
and
when
the
quarrel
lead
to
a
scuffle
in
which
they
beat
each
other
fearfully
,
to
her
inexpressible
terror
,
neither
visit
his
displeasure
upon
her
,
but
each
content
himself
with
vent
it
on
his
adversary
,
on
whom
,
in
addition
to
blow
,
he
bestow
a
variety
of
compliment
,
which
,
happily
for
the
child
,
be
convey
in
term
,
to
her
quite
unintelligible
.
 
<EOS>
the
difference
be
finally
adjust
,
by
the
man
who
have
come
out
of
the
cabin
knock
the
other
into
it
head
first
,
and
take
the
helm
into
his
own
hand
,
without
evince
the
least
discomposure
himself
,
or
cause
any
in
his
friend
,
who
,
be
of
a
tolerably
strong
constitution
and
perfectly
inure
to
such
trifle
,
go
to
sleep
as
he
be
,
with
his
heel
upwards
,
and
in
a
couple
of
minute
or
so
be
snore
comfortably
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
it
be
night
again
,
and
though
the

feel
cold

be
but
poorly

,
her
anxious
thought
be
far
remove
from
her

uneasiness

and
greasy
pavement

the
rattling
of
the
rain
on
window
and
umbrella

,
the
jostling
of
the
more
impatient
passenger
,
and
all
the
noise
and
tumult
of
a
crowded
street
in
the
high
tide
of
its
occupation
:
while
the
two
poor
stranger
,
stunned
and
bewilder
by
the
hurry
they
behold
but
have
no
part
in
,
look
mournfully
on
;
feeling
,
amidst
the
crowd
,
a
solitude
which
have
no
parallel
but
in
the
thirst
of
the
shipwreck
mariner
,
who
,
tost
to
and
fro
upon
the
billow
of
a
mighty
ocean

his
red

him

his
burn
tongue

<EOS>
They
withdraw
into
a
low
archway
for
shelter
from
the
rain
,
and
watch
the
face
of
those
who
pass
,
to
find
in
one
among
them
a
ray
of
encouragement
or
hope
.
 
<EOS>
some
frown
,
some
smile
,
some
mutter
to
themselves
,
some
make
slight
gesture
,
as
if

the
conversation
in
which
they
would
shortly
be
engage

some

the
cunning
look

bargaining
and
plotting

eager

some
slow
and
dull

in
some
countenance

be
write
gain

in
other

<EOS>
It
be
like
be
in
the
confidence
of
all
these
people
to
stand
quietly
there
,
look
into
their
face
as
they
flit
past
.
 
<EOS>
in
busy
place
,
where
each

have
an

his

<EOS>
in
the
public
walk
and
lounge
of
a
town
,
people
go
to
see
and
to
be
see
,
and
there
the
same
expression
,
with
little
variety
,
be
repeat
a
hundred
time

<EOS>
the
working

day
face
come
near
to
the
truth

and
let
it
out
more
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
fall
into
that
kind
of
abstraction
which
such
a
solitude
awaken
,
the
child
continue
to
gaze
upon
the
pass
crowd
with
a
wonder
interest
,
amount
almost
to
a
temporary
forgetfulness
of
her
own
condition
.
 
<EOS>
but
cold
,
wet
,
hunger
,
want
of
rest
,
and
lack
of
any
place
in
which
to
lay
her
ache
head

soon
bring
her

the
point
whence

stray

<EOS>
no
one

who
seem
to
notice
them

or
to
whom
she
durst
appeal

<EOS>
after
some
time

they
leave
their
place
of
refuge
from
the
weather

mingle
with
the
concourse

<EOS>
evening
come
on

<EOS>
They
be
still
wander
up
and
down
,
with
few
people
about
them
,
but
with
the
same
sense
of
solitude
in
their
own
breast
,
and
the
same
indifference
from
all
around
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
in
the
street
and
shop
make
them
feel
yet
more
desolate
,
for
with
their
help
,
night
and
darkness
seem
to
come
on
faster
.
 
<EOS>
shiver
with
the
cold
and
damp
,
ill
in
body
,
and
sick
to
death
at
heart
,
the
child
need
her
utmost
firmness
and
resolution
even
to
creep
along
.
  
<EOS>
why
have
they
ever
come
to
this
noisy
town
,
when
there
be
peaceful
country
place
,
in
which
,
at
least
,
they
may
have
hunger
and
thirst
,
with
less
suffer
than
in
its
squalid
strife
!
 
<EOS>
They
be
but
an
atom
,
here
,
in
a
mountain
heap
of
misery
,
the
very
sight
of
which
increase
their
hopelessness
and
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
have
not
only
to
endure
the
accumulate
hardship
of
their
destitute
condition
,
but
to
bear
the
reproach
of
her
grandfather
,
who
begin
to
murmur
at
have
be
lead
away
from
their
late
abode
,
and
demand
that
they
should
return
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
be
now
penniless
,
and
no
relief
or
prospect
of
relief
appearing
,
they
retrace
their
step
through
the
desert
street
,
and
go
back
to
the
wharf
,
hope
to
find
the
boat
in
which
they
have
come
,
and
to
be
allow
to
sleep
on
board
that
night

but
here
again
they
be
disappoint
,
for
the

be
closed

some
fierce
dog

bark
at

approach

oblige

to
retreat

"
We

sleep
in

the

in
a
weak
voice

as
they
turn
away
from
this
last
repulse

to

morrow
we
will
beg
our

her
travel

"
if
we

say
the
child
,
with
assumed
cheerfulness
,
as
they
walk
on
look
about
them
for
a
shelter
,
we
should
find
some
good
old
tree
,
stretch
out
his
green
arm
as

he
love
us
,
and
nodding
and
rustle
as

God

we

soon

in

let
us
think

that
it

a
good
thing

come
here

we

surely
never

us
further

there
be
comfort
in

here
be
a
deep
old

very
dark

quite
dry

warm

for
the

utter
a
half
shriek
,
she
recoil
from
a
black
figure
which
come
suddenly
out
of
the
dark
recess
in
which
they
be
about
to
take
refuge
,

stand
still

look
at

I

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
feeble
lamp
at
no
great
distance
;
the
only
one
in
the
place
,
which
be
a
kind
of
square
yard
,

sufficient
to
show
how
poor

mean
it
be

to
this
,
the
figure
beckon
them
;
at

within

no

conceal
itself

<EOS>
the
form
be
that
of
a
man

miserably
clothe
and
begrime
with
smoke
,
which
,
perhaps
by
its
contrast
with
the
natural
colour
of
his
skin
,
make
him
look
paler
than
he
really
be

that
he

naturally

pallid

his
hollow

sharp
feature

and
sink
eye

no

than
a
certain
look

patient
endurance

sufficiently
testify

His
voice
be
harsh
by
nature

not
brutal

though
his
face

besides
possess
the
characteristic
already
mention

be
overshadow
by

quantity
of
long
dark
hair

its
expression

there

yonder

They
raise
their
eye
,

lurid
glare
hang
in
the
dark
sky
;
the
dull
reflection
of
some
distant
fire

It

without

for
any
further
reply
than
he
see
in
their
look

he
take
Nell
in
his

and
bade
the
old
man
follow
.

carry
her
as
tenderly

as
easily

what
appear
to

the
poor

most
wretched
quarter
of
the

turn
aside
to
avoid
the
overflow
kennel

run
waterspout

hold
his
course
,
regardless

such
obstruction

make
his

straight
through
them

<EOS>
They
have
proceed
thus
,
in
silence
,
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
have
lose
sight
of
the
glare
to
which
he
have
point
,
in
the
dark
and
narrow
way
by
which
they
have
come
,
when
it
suddenly
burst
upon

again

stream
up
from
the
high
chimney

close

his

He
linger
so

tear

away

thus
they
separate

the

to
lead
her
sacred

farther
from
guilt

the

attach

desert

abandon

the

with

the

that
which
flow

night

when
the
noise

<EOS>
and

she

down

with
nothing

with
no

put
up
a

for
the
poor

so
very

spend
<EOS>

she
feel

so
very
calm

unresisting

that
she
have
no

any

but
pray
that
God
would
raise
up
some
friend
for

She

recall
the

they
have
come

where
the
fire
by

they

last
night
be
burn

<EOS>
She
have
forget
to
ask
the
name
of
the
poor

their

and
when
she
have
remember
him
in

prayer

it
seem
ungrateful
not

turn
one
look

a

all
they

It

very

even
hunger

She
lie
down

very
gently

with
a
quiet

fall
into

It

much

diminish
power

none

even
if
she
have
not
have
that
inducement
to
be
silent

by
her
side

<EOS>
She
feel
a
hopelessness
of
their

extricate
together
from
that
forlorn
place

a
dull
conviction
that
she
be
very
ill
,
perhaps
die
;
but
no
fear
or
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
a
loathing
of
food
that
she
be
not
conscious
of
until
they
expend
their
last
penny
in
the

of
another
loaf

Her

Their

with

there

the

thick

difficult

more

a
messenger
for
the
doctor

<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who

nosed
gentleman

a
great
bunch

bedside
of
poor
Nell

and
while

do
so

he
eye
the
half

empty
wine

glass
as
if
in
profound
abstraction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
give
her
,
"
say
the
doctor
at
length
,
"
a
tea
-
spoonful
,
every
now

then
,
of
hot
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why

that
be
exactly
what
we
have

the
delighted
landlady

<EOS>
"
I

observe
the
doctor

who
have
pass
the
foot

bath
on
the
stair
,
"
I
should
also

"
say
the
doctor
,
in
the
voice
of
an
oracle
,
"
put
her
foot
in
hot
water
,
and
wrap
them
up
in
flannel
.
<EOS>
I
should
likewise
,
"
say
the
doctor
with
increase
solemnity
,
"
give
her
something
light
for
supper
---
the
wing
of
a
roast
fowl
now
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
why
,
goodness
gracious
me
,
sir
,
it
be
cook
at
the
kitchen
fire
this
instant

cry
the
landlady

<EOS>
and
so
indeed
it
be

for
the
schoolmaster
have
order
it
to
be
put
down
,
and
it
be
get
on
so
well
that
the
doctor
may
have
smell
it
if
he
have
try
;
perhaps
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
then
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
rise
gravely
,
"
give
her
a
glass
of
hot
mulled
port
wine

<EOS>
and
a
toast
,
Sir

the
landlady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ay
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
make
a
dignified
concession
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
a
toast
---
of
bread
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
very
particular
to
make
it
of
bread
,
if
you
please
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
which
parting
injunction
,
slowly
and
portentously
deliver
,
the
doctor
depart
,
leave
the
whole
house
in
admiration
of
that
wisdom
which
tally
so
closely
with
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
say
he
be
a
very
shrewd
doctor
indeed
,
and
know
perfectly
what
people
's
constitution
be
;
which
there
appear
some
reason
to
suppose
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
while
her
supper
be
prepare
,
the
child
fall
into
a
refreshing
sleep
,
from
which
they
be
oblige
to
rouse
her
when
it
be
ready
.
<EOS>
as
she
evince
extraordinary
uneasiness
on
learn
that
her
grandfather
be
below
stair
,
and
as
she
be
greatly
troubled
at
the
thought
of
their
be
apart
,
he
take
his
supper
with
her
.
<EOS>
find
her
still
very
restless
on
this
head
,
they
make
him
up
a
bed
in
an
inner
room
,
to
which
he
presently
retire
.
 
<EOS>
the
key
of
this
chamber
happen
by
good
fortune
to
be
on
that
side
of
the
door
which
be
in
Nell
's
room
;
she
turn
it
on
him
when
the
landlady
have
withdraw
,
and
creep
to
bed
again
with
a
thankful
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
sit
for
a
long
time
smoke
his
pipe
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
which
be
now
desert
,
think
,
with
a
very
happy
face
,
on
the
fortunate
chance
which
have
bring
him
so
opportunely
to
the
child
's
assistance
,
and
parry
,
as
well
as
in
his
simple
way
he
could
,
the
inquisitive
cross
-
examination
of
the
landlady
,
who
have
a
great
curiosity
to
be
make
acquainted
with
every
particular
of
Nell
's
life
and
history
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
schoolmaster
be
so
open
-
hearted
,
and
so
little
versed
in
the
most
ordinary
cunning
or
deceit
,
that
she
could
not
have
fail
to
succeed
in
the
first
five
minute
,
but
that
he
happen
to
be
unacquainted
with
what
she
wish
to
know
;
and
so
he
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
by
no
mean
satisfied
with
this
assurance
,
which
she
consider
an
ingenious
evasion
of
the
question
,
rejoin
that
he
have
his
reason
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
she
should
wish
to
pry
into
the
affair
of
her
customer
,
which
indeed
be
no
business
of
her
,
who
have
so
many
of
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
merely
ask
a
civil
question
,
and
to
be
sure
she
know
it
would
meet
with
a
civil
answer
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
satisfied
---
quite
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
rather
perhaps
that
he
would
have
say
at
once
that
he
do
not
choose
to
be
communicative
,
because
that
would
have
be
plain
and
intelligible
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
no
right
to
be
offend
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
good
judge
,
and
have
a
perfect
right
to
say
what
he
please
;
nobody
could
dispute
that
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
no
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
my
good
lady
,
"
say
the
mild
schoolmaster
,
"
that
I
have
tell
you
the
plain
truth
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
hope
to
be
save
,
I
have
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
I
do
believe
you
be
in
earnest
,
"
rejoin
the
landlady
,
with
ready
good
-
humour
,
"
and
I
be
very
sorry
I
have
teaze
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
curiosity
you
know
be
the
curse
of
our
sex
,
and
that
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
the
landlord
scratch
his
head
,
as
if
he
think
the
curse
sometimes
involve
the
other
sex
likewise
;
but
he
be
prevent
from
make
any
remark
to
that
effect
,
if
he
have
it
in
contemplation
to
do
so
,
by
the
schoolmaster
's
rejoinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
question
me
for
half
-
a
-
dozen
hour
at
a
sitting
,
and
welcome
,
and
I
would
answer
you
patiently
for
the
kindness
of
heart
you
have
show
to
-
night
,
if
I
could
,

he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
it
be
,
please
to
take
care
of
her
in
the
morning
,
and
let
me
know
early
how
she
be
;
and
to
understand
that
I
be
paymaster
for
the
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
part
with
them
on
most
friendly
term
(
not
the
less
cordial
perhaps
for
this
last
direction
)
,
the
schoolmaster
go
to
his
bed
,
and
the
host
and
hostess
to
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
the
report
in
the
morning
be
,
that
the
child
be
well
,
but
be
extremely
weak
,
and
would
at
least
require
a
day
's
rest
,
and
careful
nursing
,
before
she
could
proceed
upon
her
journey
.
 
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
receive
this
communication
with
perfect
cheerfulness
,
observe
that
he
have
a
day
to
spare
---
two
day
for
that
matter
---
and
could
very
well
afford
to
wait
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
patient
be
to
sit
up
in
the
evening
,
he
appoint
to
visit
her
in
her
room
at
a
certain
hour
,
and
ramble
out
with
his
book
,
do
not
return
until
the
hour
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
Nell
could
not
help
weep
when
they
be
leave
alone
;
whereat
,
and
at
sight
of
her
pale
face
and
waste
figure
,
the
simple
schoolmaster
shed
a
few
tear
himself
,
at
the
same
time
show
in
very
energetic
language
how
foolish
it
be
to
do
so
,
and
how
very
easily
it
could
be
avoid
,
if
one
try
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
make
me
unhappy
even
in
the
midst
of
all
this
kindness
"
say
the
child
,
"
to
think
that
we
should
be
a
burden
upon
you

how
can
I
ever
thank
you

if
I

you
so
far

"
We

I

make
my
fortune

the

joyfully

return
her
friend

<EOS>

I
have
be

perhaps
you

I

a
reason

the

the
truth

a
confidence

it
cold

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
what
a
delicious
journey
be
that
journey
in
the
waggon
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
go
on
again
---
so
fresh
at
first
,
and
shortly
afterwards
so
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
the
waking
from
a
sound
nap
as
the
mail
come
dash
past
like
a
highway
comet
,
with
gleaming
lamp
and
rattle
hoofs
,
and
vision
of
a
guard
behind
,
stand
up
to
keep
his
foot
warm
,
and
of
a
gentleman
in
a
fur
cap
open
his
eye
and
look
wild
and
stupefy
---
<EOS>
the
stopping
at
the
turnpike
where
the
man
be
go
to
bed
,
and
knock
at
the
door
until
he
answer
with
a
smothered
shout
from
under
the
bed
-
clothe
in
the
little
room
above
,
where
the
faint
light
be
burn
,
and
presently
come
down
,
night
-
cap
and
shiver
,
to
throw
the
gate
wide
open
,
and
wish
all
waggon
off
the
road
except
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
cold
sharp
interval
between
night
and
morning
---
the
distant
streak
of
light
widen
and
spread
,
and
turn
from
grey
to
white
,
and
from
white
to
yellow
,
and
from
yellow
to
burn
red
---
the
presence
of
day
,
with
all
its
cheerfulness
and
life
---
man
and
horse
at
the
plough
---
bird
in
the
tree
and
hedge
,
and
boy
in
solitary
field
,
frighten
them
away
with
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
the
come
to
a
town
---
<EOS>
people
busy
in
the
market
;
light
cart
and
chaise
round
the
tavern
yard
;
tradesman
stand
at
their
door
;
man
run
horse
up
and
down
the
street
for
sale
;
pig
plunge
and
grunt
in
the
dirty
distance
,
get
off
with
long
string
at
their
leg
,
run
into
clean
chemist

shop
and
be
dislodge
with
broom
by

prentice
;
the
night
coach
change
horse
---
the
passenger
cheerless
,
cold
,
ugly
,
and
discontent
,
with
three
month
'
growth
of
hair
in
one
night
---
the
coachman
fresh
as
from
a
band
-
box
,
and
exquisitely
beautiful
by
contrast
:
---
so
much
bustle
,
so
many
thing
in
motion
,
such
a
variety
of
incident
---
when
be
there
a
journey
with
so
many
delight
as
that
journey
in
the
waggon
!
  
<EOS>
sometimes
walk
for
a
mile
or
two
while
her
grandfather
ride
inside
,
and
sometimes
even
prevail
upon
the
schoolmaster
to
take
her
place
and
lie
down
to
rest
,
Nell
travel
on
very
happily
until
they
come
to
a
large
town
,
where
the
waggon
stop
,
and
where
they
spend
a
night
.
 
<EOS>
They
pass
a
large
church
;
and
in
the
street
be
a
number
of
old
house
,
build
of
a
kind
of
earth
or
plaster
,
cross
and
re
-
cross
in
a
great
many
direction
with
black
beam
,
which
give
them
a
remarkable
and
very
ancient
look
.
<EOS>
the
door
,
too
,
be
arched
and
low
,
some
with
oaken
portal
and
quaint
bench
,
where
the
former
inhabitant
have
sit
on
summer
evening
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
be
lattice
in
little
diamond
pane
,
that
seem
to
wink
and
blink
upon
the
passenger
as
if
they
be
dim
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
long
since
get
clear
of
the
smoke
and
furnace
,
except
in
one
or
two
solitary
instance
,
where
a
factory
plant
among
field
wither
the
space
about
it
,
like
a
burn
mountain
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
pass
through
this
town
,
they
enter
again
upon
the
country
,
and
begin
to
draw
near
their
place
of
destination
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
near
,
however
,
but
that
they
spend
another
night
upon
the
road
;
not
that
their
doing
so
be
quite
an
act
of
necessity
,
but
that
the
schoolmaster
,
when
they
approach
within
a
few
mile
of
his
village
,
have
a
fidgety
sense
of
his
dignity
as
the
new
clerk
,
and
be
unwilling
to
make
his
entry
in
dusty
shoe
,
and
travel
-
disorder
dress
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
,
clear
,
autumn
morning
,
when
they
come
upon
the
scene
of
his
promotion
,
and
stop
to
contemplate
its
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
see
---
here
be
the
church
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
delighted
schoolmaster
in
a
low
voice
;
"
and
that
old
building
close
beside
it
,
be
the
school
-
house
,
I
will
be
swear
.
 
<EOS>
five
-
and
-
thirty
pound
a
-
year
in
this
beautiful
place
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
admire
everything
---
the
old
grey
porch
,
the
mullione
window
,
the
venerable
gravestone
dot
the
green
churchyard
,
the
ancient
tower
,
the
very
weathercock
;
the
brown
thatch
roof
of
cottage
,
barn
,
and
homestead
,
peep
from
among
the
tree
;
the
stream
that
ripple
by
the
distant
water
-
mill
;
the
blue
Welsh
mountain
far
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
for
such
a
spot
the
child
have
weary
in
the
dense
,
dark
,
miserable
haunt
of
labour
.
 
<EOS>
upon
her
bed
of
ashe
,
and
amidst
the
squalid
horror
through
which
they
have
force
their
way
,
vision
of
such
scene
---
beautiful
indeed
,
but
not
more
beautiful
than
this
sweet
reality
---
have
be
always
present
to
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
seem
to
melt
into
a
dim
and
airy
distance
,
as
the
prospect
of
ever
behold
them
again
grow
fainter
;
but
,
as
they
recede
,
she
have
love
and
pant
for
them
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
you
somewhere
for
a
few
minute
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
at
length
break
the
silence
into
which
they
have
fall
in
their
gladness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
letter
to
present
,
and
inquiry
to
make
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
where
shall
I
take
you
?
 
<EOS>
to
the
little
inn
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
wait
here
,
"
rejoin
Nell
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
gate
be
open
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
sit
in
the
church
porch
till
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
good
place
too
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
lead
the
way
towards
it
,
disencumber
himself
of
his
portmanteau
,
and
place
it
on
the
stone
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
sure
that
I
come
back
with
good
news
,
and
be
not
long
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
the
happy
schoolmaster
put
on
a
bran
-
new
pair
of
glove
which
he
have
carry
in
a
little
parcel
in
his
pocket
all
the
way
,
and
hurry
off
,
full
of
ardour
and
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
watch
him
from
the
porch
until
the
intervene
foliage
hide
him
from
her
view
,
and
then
step
softly
out
into
the
old
churchyard
---
so
solemn
and
quiet
that
every
rustle
of
her
dress
upon
the
fall
leave
,
which
strew
the
path
and
make
her
footstep
noiseless
,
seem
an
invasion
of
its
silence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
aged
,
ghostly
place
;
the
church
have
be
build
many
hundred
of
year
ago
,
and
have
once
have
a
convent
or
monastery
attach
;
for
arch
in
ruin
,
remain
of
oriel
window
,
and
fragment
of
blacken
wall
,
be
yet
standing-
,
while
other
portion
of
the
old
building
,
which
have
crumble
away
and
fall
down
,
be
mingle
with
the
churchyard
earth
and
overgrow
with
grass
,
as
if
they
too
claim
a
burying
-
place
and
seek
to
mix
their
ashe
with
the
dust
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
hard
by
these
gravestone
of
dead
year
,
and
form
a
part
of
the
ruin
which
some
pain
have
be
take
to
render
habitable
in
modern
time
,
be
two
small
dwelling
with
sunken
window
and
oaken
door
,
fast
hasten
to
decay
,
empty
and
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
tenement
,
the
attention
of
the
child
become
exclusively
rivet
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
not
why
.
 
<EOS>
the
church
,
the
ruin
,
the
antiquated
grave
,
have
equal
claim
at
least
upon
a
stranger
's
thought
,
but
from
the
moment
when
her
eye
first
rest
on
these
two
dwelling
,
she
could
turn
to
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
she
have
make
the
circuit
of
the
enclosure
,
and
,
return
to
the
porch
,
sit
pensively
wait
for
their
friend

she
take
her

that

Kit

mother

the
single
gentleman
---
upon
whose
track
it
be
expedient
to
follow
with
hurried
step
,
lest
this
history
should
be
chargeable
with
inconstancy
,

the
offence
of
leave
its

in
situation
of
uncertainty
and
doubt

<EOS>
Kit

speed
onward
in

four
whose
departure
from

<EOS>
we

already

soon
leave
the

behind

the

be
not

by

little

both

have
fall
into
the
fire

tumble
down

have
be
squeeze
behind

or
have
scald
their
windpipe
in
endeavour
to
allay
their
thirst
at
the
spout
of
tea
-
kettles
,
preserve
an
uneasy
silence
;
and
meet
from
the

the
eye
of
turnpike

man
,
omnibus
-
driver
,
and
other
,
feel
in
the
new
dignity
of
her
position
like

mourner
at

who

not

greatly
afflict
by
the

be
constrain

a

the
appearance

indifferent
to
all
external
object
.
  
<EOS>
to
have
be
indifferent
to
the
companionship
of
the
single

would
have
be
tantamount
to

<EOS>
never

chaise

such
a

<EOS>
He
never
sit
in
the

position
for
two
minute
together
,
but
be
perpetually
toss
his
arm
and
leg
about
,
pull
up
the
sash
and
let
them
violently
down
,
or
thrust
his
head
out
of
one
window
to
draw
it
in
again
and
thrust
it
out
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
in
his
pocket
,
too
,
a
fire
-
box
of
mysterious
and
unknown
construction
;
and
as
sure
as
ever
Kit
's
mother
close
her
eye
,
so
surely
---
whisk
,
rattle
,
fizz
---
there
be
the
single
gentleman
consult
his
watch
by
a
flame
of
fire
,
and
let
the
spark
fall
down
among
the
straw
as
if
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
possibility
of
himself
and
Kit

mother
be
roast
alive
before
the

could
stop
their
horse
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
they
halt
to
change
,
there
he
be
---
out
of
the
carriage
without
let
down
the
step
,
burst
about
the

-
yard
like
a
light

,
pull
out
his
watch
by

light
and
forget

put
it
up
again

in
short
commit
so
many
extravagance
that
Kit

be
quite
afraid
of

<EOS>
then
,
when
the

like

and
before

a

out
come
the

together
,
and
Kit

as

with

<EOS>
It
be
in

for
Kit

to
protest
that
she
stand
in
need

<EOS>
the

be
inexorable

and
whenever

have
exhaust
all
other

it
invariably
occur
to
him
that
kit

<EOS>
in
this
way
they
travel
on

near
midnight

when
they
stop
to
supper
,
for
which
meal
the
single
gentleman
order
everything
eatable
that
the

contain

and
because
Kit
's
mother
do
not
eat
everything
at

and
eat
it
all
,
he
take
it
into
his
head

add
(
which

that
they
have
make
every
possible
effort

trace
them

but
without
success

have
be
at

in
great

departure

They
dwelt
upon

imbecility

twist
it
into
all
imaginable
variety

ugliness

Mr

rock
himself
to
and
fro
in
his
chair

nurse
his
left
leg
at
the

time

fall
into
certain
meditation

of
which
it
may
be
necessary
to
relate
the
substance

first
,
he
review
the
circumstance
which
have
lead
to
his
repairing
to
that
spot
,
which
be
briefly
these
.
 
<EOS>
drop
in
at
Mr
Sampson
Brass
's
office
on
the
previous
evening
,
in
the
absence
of
that
gentleman
and
his
learn
sister
,
he
have
light
upon
Mr
Swiveller
,
who
chance
at
the
moment
to
be
sprinkle
a
glass
of
warm
gin
and
water
on
the
dust
of
the
law
,
and
to
be
moisten
his
clay
,
as
the
phrase
go
,
rather
copiously
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
clay
in
the
abstract
,
when
too
much
moistened
,
become
of
a
weak
and
uncertain
consistency
,
break
down
in
unexpected
place
,
retain
impression
but
faintly
,
and
preserve
no
strength
or
steadiness
of
character
,
so
Mr
Swiveller
's
clay
,
have
imbibe
a
considerable
quantity
of
moisture
,
be
in
a
very
loose
and
slippery
state
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
the
various
idea
impress
upon
it
be
fast
lose
their
distinctive
character
,
and
run
into
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
uncommon
for
human
clay
in
this
condition
to
value
itself
above
all
thing
upon
its
great
prudence
and
sagacity
;
and
Mr
Swiveller
,
especially
prize
himself
upon
these
quality
,
take
occasion
to
remark
that
he
have
make
strange
discovery
in
connection
with
the
single
gentleman
who
lodge
above
,
which
he
have
determine
to
keep
within
his
own
bosom
,
and
which
neither
torture
nor
cajolery
should
ever
induce
him
to
reveal
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
determination
<EOS>
Mr
Quilp
express
his
high
approval
,
and
set
himself
in
the
same
breath
to
goad
Mr
Swiveller
on
to
further
hint
,
soon
make
out
that
the
single
gentleman
have
be
see
in
communication
with
kit
,
and
that
this
be
the
secret
which
be
never
to
be
disclose
.
  
<EOS>
possess
of
this
piece
of
information
,
Mr
Quilp
directly
suppose
that
the
single
gentleman
above
stair
must
be
the
same
individual
who
have
wait
on
him
,
and
have
assure
himself
by
further
inquiry
that
this
surmise
be
correct
,
have
no
difficulty
in
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
intent
and
object
of
his
correspondence
with
Kit
be
the
recovery
of
his
old
client
and
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
burn
with
curiosity
to
know
what
proceeding
be
afoot
,
he
resolve
to
pounce
upon
Kit
's
mother
as
the
person
least
able
to
resist
his
art
,
and
consequently
the
most
likely
to
be
entrap
into
such
revelation
as
he
seek
;
so
take
an
abrupt
leave
of
Mr
Swiveller
,
he
hurry
to
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
woman
be
from
home
,
he
make
inquiry
of
a
neighbour
,
as
kit
himself
do
soon
afterwards
,
and
be
direct
to
the
chapel
be
take
himself
there
,
in
order
to
waylay
her
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
sit
in
the
chapel
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
with
his
eye
piously
fix
upon
the
ceiling
be
chuckle
inwardly
over
the
joke
of
his
be
there
at
all
,
when
kit

appear
.

watchful
as

the
dwarf
that
he
have
come
on
business

<EOS>
absorb
in
appearance
,
<EOS>
as
we
have
see
,
and
feign
a
profound
abstraction
,
he
note
every
circumstance
of
his
behaviour
,
and
when
he
withdraw
with
his
family
,
shoot
out
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
fine
,
he
trace
them
to
the
notary
's
house
;
learn
the
destination
of
the
carriage
from
one
of
the
postilion
;
and
know
that
a
fast
night
-
coach
start
for
the
same
place
,
at
the
very
hour
which
be
on
the
point
of
strike
,
from
a
street
hard
by
,
dart
round
to
the
coach
-
office
without
more
ado
,
and
take
his
seat
upon
the
roof
.
<EOS>
after
pass
and
repasse
the
carriage
on
the
road
,
and
be
pass
and
repasse
by
it
sundry
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
accord
as
their
stoppage
be
long
or
short
;
or
their
rate
of
travel
varied
,
they
reach
the
town
almost
together

<EOS>
Quilp
keep
the
chaise
in
sight
,
mingle
with
the
crowd
,
learn
the
single
gentleman
's
errand
,
and
its
failure
,
and
have
possess
himself
of
all
that
it
be
material
to
know

hurry
off
,
reach
the
inn
before
him

have
the
interview
just
now

and
shut
himself
up
in
the
little
room
in
which
he
hastily
review
all
these

greedily
bite
his

I
be
suspect

throw
aside

I
shall
have
to
dispose
of
him

have
come
up
with
them
this
morning

after
a
thoughtful
pause

I
be
ready
to
prove
a
pretty
good
claim

I
could
have
make
my
profit

but
for
these
cant
hypocrite
,
the
lad

I
could
get
this
fiery

as
comfortably
into

let
us
find
them
first

I
will
find
mean
of
drain
you
of
some
of
your
superfluous

there
be
prison

I
hate
'em
every

<EOS>
this
be
not
a
mere
empty
vaunt

but
a
deliberate
avowal
of
his
real
sentiment
;
for
Mr
Quilp
,
who
love
nobody
,
have
by
little
and
little
come
to
hate
everybody
nearly
or
remotely
connected
with
his
ruin
client
:
 
---
the
old
man
himself
,
because
he
have
be
able
to
deceive
him
and
elude
his
vigilance

she
be
the
object
of
Mrs
Quilp

commiseration

constant
self

the
single
gentleman

of
his
unconcealed
aversion

most
mortally
,
for
the
reason

above

beyond
that
general
feeling

in
this
amiable
mood

enliven
himself
and
his
hatred
with
more
brandy

and
then
,
change
his
quarter

to
an

alehouse

under
cover

institute
all

be
some
gratification
to
Mr
Quilp
to
find
,
as
he
take
his
place
upon
the
roof
,
that
kit
's
mother
be
alone
inside
;
from
which
circumstance
he
derive
in
the
course
of
the
journey
much
cheerfulness
of
spirit
,
inasmuch
as
her
solitary
condition
enable
him
to
terrify
her
with
many
extraordinary
annoyance
;
such
as
hang
over
the
side
of
the
coach
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
and
stare
in
with
his
great
goggle
eye
,
which
seem
in
hers
the
more
horrible
from
his
face
be
upside
down
;
dodge
her
in
this
way
from
one
window
to
another
;
get
nimbly
down
whenever
they
change
horse
and
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
window
with
a
dismal
squint
:
which
ingenious
torture
have
such
an
effect
upon
Mrs
Nubbles
,
that
she
be
quite
unable
for
the
time
to
resist
the
belief
that
Mr
Quilp
do
in
his
own
person
represent
and
embody
that
Evil
Power
,
who
be
so
vigorously
attack
at
Little
Bethel

and
who

by
reason
of

backsliding
in

of

be
now
frolicsome
and

Quilp
say
not

Kit

mother
may
have
spare
herself
the
trouble
of
look
back
so
often
,
for
nothing
be
further
from
Mr

any

renew
the

He
go
his

whistle
from

be
doubtless
by

constantly
faint
away
with
anxiety

grief

this
facetious

be
so
congenial
to
the
dwarf

humour

and
so
exquisitely
amusing
to
him
,
that
he
laugh
as
he
go
along
until
the
tear
run
down
his

;
and
more
than

,
when
he
find
himself
in

vent
his

in
a
shrill

Mr

gaze
up

he
descry
more

draw
nearer

listen
attentively

he

hear
several

among

distinguish

not

those
of

He

<EOS>
a

after

"

"

I

"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
could
only
point
to
the
window
,
and
reply
with
a
stifled
giggle
,
expressive
of
such
intense
enjoyment
,
that
Quilp
clutch
him
by
the
throat
and
may
have
carry
his
threat
into
execution
,
or
at

have
make
very
good
progress
towards
that
end
,
but
for
the

be
nimbly
extricate
himself
from
his
grasp
,
and
fortify
himself
behind
the
near
post
,
at
which
,
after
some
fruitless
attempt
to
catch
him
by
the
hair
of

"
You

the
prospect

play
the
spy

delicious
circumstance

and
of
disappoint
them
all
by
walk
in

give
more

<EOS>
He
be
no

for
some
second

grin

gasp
and
wag
their
head
at
each
other
,
on
either
side
of
the

like

"

he
blow
out

kick
off

grope
his
way
up

leave

the
Thames

up

erect
chimney
deposit
the
smoke

off

such
inconvenience

after
dine
luxuriously
from

light
his
pipe
,
and
smoke
against
the
chimney

nothing
of
him

visible
through
the
mist

a
pair
of
red
and
highly
inflame

sometimes
a
dim

the
evening
with
great
cheerfulness

solace
himself
all
the
time
with
the
pipe
and
the
case

bottle
;
and
occasionally
entertain
himself
with
a
melodious
howl

intend
for
a
song

bear
not
the
faint
resemblance

any
scrap

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be

knock
at

"
She

"
  
<EOS>
after
a
sufficiently
long
interval
,
the
door
be
open
,
and
a
small
voice
immediately
accost
him
with
,
"
<EOS>
oh
please
will
you
leave
a
card
or

?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
eh

"
say

look
down

(
it

quite
new

upon

small

push
past
her
into
the
office
;
"
and
mind
your
master
have
it
directly

come
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
Mr
Quilp
climb
up
to
the
top
of
a
tall
stool
to
write
the
note
,
and
the
small
servant
,
carefully
tutor
for
such
emergency
,
look
on
with
her
eye
wide
open
,
ready
,
if
he
so
much
as
abstract
a
wafer
,
to
rush
into
the
street
and
give
the
alarm
to
the
police
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr

fold
his
note
(
which
be
soon

very
short
one

<EOS>
he
encounter
the
gaze
of
the
small

<EOS>
He
look
at
her
,
long
and
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
?
"
say
the
dwarf
,
moisten
a
wafer
with
horrible
grimace
.
  
<EOS>
the
small
servant
,
perhaps
frighten
by
his
look
,
return
no
audible
reply
;
but
it
appear
from
the
motion
of
her
lip
that
she
be
inwardly
repeat
the
same
form
of
expression
concern
the
note
or

<EOS>
"
do
they
use
you
ill
here
?
 
<EOS>
be
your
mistress
a
Tartar
?
"
say
Quilp
with
a
chuckle
.
  
<EOS>
in
reply
to
the
last
interrogation
,
the
small
servant
,
with
a
look
of
infinite
cunne
mingle
with
fear
,
screw
up
her
mouth
very
tight
and
round
,
and
nod
violently
.
 
<EOS>
whether
there
be
anything
in
the
peculiar
slyness
of
her
action
which
fascinate
Mr
Quilp
,
or
anything
in
the
expression
of
her
feature
at
the
moment
which
attract
his
attention
for
some
other
reason
;
or
whether
it
merely
occur
to
him
as
a
pleasant
whim
to
stare
the
small
servant
out
of
countenance
;
certain
it
be
,
that
he
plant
his
elbow
square
and
firmly
on
the
desk
,
and
squeeze
up
his
cheek
with
his
hand
,
look
at
her
fixedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
come
from
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
after
a
long
pause
,
stroke
his
chin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what

"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing

<EOS>
"
  
"
nonsense

"
retort
Quilp
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
your

call
you
when
she
want
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
little
devil
,
"
say
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
She
add
in
the
same
breath
,
as
if
fearful
of
any
further
questioning
,
"
<EOS>
but
please
will
you
leave
a
card
or
message
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
these
unusual
answer
may
naturally
have
provoke
some
more
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
Quilp
,
however
,
without
utter
another
word
,
withdraw
his
eye
from
the
small
servant
,
stroke
his
chin
more
thoughtfully
than
before
,
and
then
,
bend
over
the
note
as
if
to
direct
it
with
scrupulous
and
hair
-
breadth
nicety
,
look
at
her
,
covertly
but
very
narrowly
,
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrow
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
this
secret
survey
be
,
that
he
shade
his
face
with
his
hand
,
and
laugh
slyly
and
noiselessly
,
until
every
vein
in
it
be
swell
almost
to
burst
.
 
<EOS>
pull
his
hat
over
his
brow
to
conceal
his
mirth
and
its
effect
,
he
toss
the
letter
to
the
child
,
and
hastily
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
once
in
the
street
,
move
by
some
secret
impulse
,
he
laugh
,
and
hold
his
side
,
and
laugh
again
,
and
try
to
peer
through
the
dusty
area
railing
as
if
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
the
child
,
until
he
be
quite
tired
out
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
travel
back
to
the
Wilderness
,
which
be
within
rifle
-
shot
of
his
bachelor
retreat
,
and
order
tea
in
the
wooden
summer
-
house
that
afternoon
for
three
person
;
an
invitation
to
Miss
Sally
Brass
and
her
brother
to
partake
of
that
entertainment
at
that
place
,
have
be
the
object
both
of
his
journey
and
his
note
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
precisely
the
kind
of
weather
in
which
people
usually
take
tea
in
summer
-
house
,
far
less
in
summer
-
house
in
an
advanced
state
of
decay
,
and
overlook
the
slimy
bank
of
a
great
river
at
low
water
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
in
this
choice
retreat
that
Mr
Quilp
order
a
cold
collation
to
be
prepare
,
and
it
be
beneath
its
cracked
and
leaky
roof
that
he
,
in
due
course
of
time
,
receive
Mr
Sampson
and
his
sister
Sally
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
fond
of
the
beauty
of
nature

say
Quilp
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
this
charming
,
Brass

<EOS>
be

unusual

unsophisticated

primitive

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
delightful
indeed

the

<EOS>
"
cool

Quilp

<EOS>
"
n-
<EOS>
not
particularly
so

I
think
,
sir

"
rejoin
Brass
,
with
his
tooth
chatter
in
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
a
little
damp
and
ague
-
ish
?
"
say
Quilp
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
damp
enough
to
be
cheerful
,
sir
,
"
rejoin
Brass
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
more
,
sir
,
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Sally
?
"
say
the
delighted
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
she
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
like
it
better
,
"
return
that
strong
-
minded
lady
,
"
when
she
have
tea
;
so
let
us
have
it
,
and
do
not
bother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sweet
Sally
!
"
cry
Quilp
,
extend
his
arm
as
if
about
to
embrace
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
gentle
,
charming
,
overwhelming
Sally

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
very
remarkable
man
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
soliloquise
Mr
Brass
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
quite
a
Troubadour
,
you
know
;
quite
a
Troubadour
!
"
  
<EOS>
these
complimentary
expression
be
utter
in
a
somewhat
absent
and
distracted
manner
;
for
the
unfortunate
lawyer
,
besides
have
a
bad
cold
in
his
head
,
have
get
wet
in
come
,
and
would
have
willingly
bear
some
pecuniary
sacrifice
if
he
could
have
shift
his
present
raw
quarter
to
a
warm
room
,
and
dry
himself
at
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Quilp
,
however
---
who
,
beyond
the
gratification
of
his
demon
whim
,
owe
Sampson
some
acknowledgment
of
the
part
he
have
play
in
the
mourning
scene
of
which
he
have
be
a
hide
witness
,
mark
these
symptom
of
uneasiness
with
a
delight
past
all
expression
,
and
derive
from
them
a
secret
joy
which
the
costly
banquet
could
never
have
afford
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
remark
,
too
,
as
illustrate
a
little
feature
in
the
character
of
Miss
Sally
Brass
,
that
,
although
on
her
own
account
she
would
have
bear
the
discomfort
of
the
wilderness
with
a
very
ill
grace
,
and
would
probably
,
indeed
,
have
walk
off
before
the
tea
appear
,
she
no
sooner
beheld
the
latent
uneasiness
and
misery
of
her
brother
than
she
develop
a
grim
satisfaction
,
and
begin
to
enjoy
herself
after
her
own
manner
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
wet
come
steal
through
the
roof
and
trickle
down
upon
their
head
,
Miss
Brass
utter
no
complaint
,
but
preside
over
the
tea
equipage
with
imperturbable
composure
.
 
<EOS>
while
Mr
Quilp
,
in
his
uproarious
hospitality
,
seat
himself
upon
an
empty
beer
-
barrel
,
vaunt
the
place
as
the
most
beautiful
and
comfortable
in
the
three
kingdom
,
and
elevate
his
glass
,
drink
to
their
next
merry
-
meeting
in
that
jovial
spot
;
and
Mr
Brass
,
with
the
rain
plash
down
into
his
tea
-
cup
,
make
a
dismal
attempt
to
pluck
up
his
spirit
and
appear
at
his
ease
;
and
Tom
Scott
,
who
be
in
wait
at
the
door
under
an
old
umbrella
,
exult
in
his
agony
,
and
bade
fair
to
split
his
side
with
laughing
;
while
all
this
be
pass
,
Miss
Sally
Brass
,
unmindful
of
the
wet
which
drip
down
upon
her
own
feminine
person
and
fair
apparel
,
sit
placidly
behind
the
tea
-
board
,
erect
and
grizzly
,
contemplate
the
unhappiness
of
her
brother
with
a
mind
at
ease
,
and
content
,
in
her
amiable
disregard
of
self
,
to
sit
there
all
night
,
witness
the
torment
which
his
avaricious
and
grovel
nature
compel
him
to
endure
and
forbade
him
to
resent
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
,
it
must
be
observe
,
or
the
illustration
would
be
incomplete
,
although
in
a
business
point
of
view
she
have
the
strong
sympathy
with
Mr
Sampson
,
and
would
have
be
beyond
measure
indignant
if
he
have
thwart
their
client
in
any
one
respect

<EOS>
in
the
height
of
his
boisterous
merriment
,
Mr
Quilp

have
on
some
pretence
dismiss
his
attendant
sprite
for
the
moment
,
resume
his
usual
manner
all
at
once
,
dismount
from
his
cask
,
and
lay
his
hand
upon
the

sleeve

"

nobody

the
office

how

learn
all
this
in

sexton

he
have
be
bold

his
fellow

traveller

have
be
so
favourably
receive
by

high
authority

courage

act
on
his
advice

to
propound
the
matter
to
the
clergyman

<EOS>
in
a
word

the
result

his
exertion

,
that
Nell

her
grandfather

gentleman

his
approval

small
allowance

They
repair
to
the
other
tenement

try
the
rusty
key

at
length

the
right
one

the

Neighbours

proffer
their

their

with
such
small
present

It

and
find
them
wonder
that
there
be
yet
so
much
to
do
,
and
that
it
should
be
dark
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
They
take
their
supper
together
,
in
the
house
which

when
they

finish
their
meal

draw
round
the

and
almost
in
whisper
---
their
heart
be
too
quiet
and
glad
for
loud
expression
---
discuss
their
future
plan

<EOS>
before
they
separate

the
schoolmaster
read
some
prayer
aloud
;
and
then
,
full
of
gratitude
and
happiness
,
they
part
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
silent
hour
,
when
her
grandfather
be
sleep
peacefully
in
his
bed
,
and
every
sound
be
hush
,
the
child
linger
before
the
die
ember
,
and
thought
of
her
past
fortune
as
if
they
have
be
a
dream
<EOS>
and
she
only
now
awake

<EOS>
the

,
reflect
in
the
oaken
panel
whose
carve

in
the
dusky
roof
---
the
aged
wall
,
where
strange
shadow
come
and
go
with
every
flickering
of
the
fire
---
the
solemn
presence
,
within
,
of
that
decay
which
fall
on
senseless
thing
the
most
enduring
in
their
nature
:
and
,
without
,
and
round
about
on
every
side
,
of
death
---
fill
her
with
deep
and
thoughtful
feeling
,
but
with
none
of
terror
or
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
a
change

be
gradually
steal
over
her
,
in
the
time
of
her
loneliness
and
sorrow

<EOS>
with
fail
strength
and
heighten
resolution
,
there
have
spring
up
a
purified
and
altered
mind
;
there

grow
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
bless
thought
and
hope
,
which
be
the
portion
of
few
but
the
weak
and
drooping
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
to
see
the
frail
,
perishable
figure
,
as
it
glide
from
the
fire
and
lean
pensively
at
the
open
casement
;
none
but
the
star
,
to
look
into
the
upturned
face
and
read
its
history
.
<EOS>
the
old
church
bell
ring
out
the
hour
with
a
mournful
sound
,
as
if
it
have
grow
sad
from
so
much
commune
with
the
dead
and
unheeded
warning
to
the
living
;
the
fall
leave
rustle
;
the
grass
stir
upon
the
grave
;
all
else
be
still
and
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
those
dreamless
sleeper
lie
close
within
the
shadow
of
the
church
---
touch
the
wall
,
as
if
they
cling
to
it
for
comfort
and
protection

<EOS>
other
have
choose
to
lie
beneath
the
change
shade
of
tree
;
other
by
the
path
,
that
footstep
may
come
near
them
;
other
,
among
the
grave
of
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
some
have
desire
to
rest
beneath
the
very
ground
they
have
trodden
in
their
daily
walk
;
some
,
where
the
set
sun
may
shine
upon
their
bed
;
some
,
where
its
light
would
fall
upon
them
when
it
rise
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
not
one
of
the
imprison
soul
have
be
able
quite
to
separate
itself
in
live
think
from
its
old
companion
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
have
,
it
have
still
feel
for
it
a
love
like
that
which
captive
have
be
know
to
bear
towards
the
cell
in
which
they
have
be
long
confine
,
and
,
even
at
parting
,
hang
upon
its
narrow
bound
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
the
child
close
the
window
,
and
approach
her
bed
.
 
<EOS>
again
something
of
the
same
sensation
as
before
---
an
involuntary
chill
---
a
momentary
feeling
akin
to
fear
---
but
vanish
directly
,
and
leave
no
alarm
behind
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
too
,
dream
of
the
little
scholar
;
of
the
roof
opening
,
and
a
column
of
bright
face
,
rise
far
away
into
the
sky
,
as
she
have
see
in
some
old
scriptural
picture
once
,
and
look
down
on
her
,
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sweet
and
happy
dream
.
 
<EOS>
the
quiet
spot
,
outside
,
seem
to
remain
the
same
,
save
that
there
be
music
in
the
air
,
and
a
sound
of
angel
'
wing
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
time
the
sister
come
there
,
hand
in
hand
,
and
stand
among
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
dream
grow
dim
,
and
fade
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
brightness
and
joy
of
morning
,
come
the
renewal
of
yesterday
's
labour
,
the
revival
of
its
pleasant
thought
,
the
restoration
of
its
energy
,
cheerfulness
,
and
hope
.
 
<EOS>
They
work
gaily
in
order
and
arrange
their
house
until
noon
,
and
then
go
to
visit
the
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
simple
-
hearted
old
gentleman
,
of
a
shrink
,
subdue
spirit
,
accustom
to
retirement
,
and
very
little
acquaint
with
the
world
,
which
he
have
leave
many
year
before
to
come
and
settle
in
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
have
die
in
the
house
in
which
he
still
live
,
and
he
have
long
since
lose
sight
of
any
earthly
care
or
hope
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
receive
them
very
kindly
,
and
at
once
show
an
interest
in
Nell
;
ask
her
name
,
and
age
,
her
birthplace
,
the
circumstance
which
have
lead
her
there
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
have
already
tell
her
story
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
other
friend
or
home
to
leave
,
he
say
,
and
have
come
to
share
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
love
the
child
as
though
she
be
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
it
be
as
you
desire
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
young
.
<EOS>
""Old
<EOS>
in
adversity
and
trial
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
schoolmaster
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
help
her
.
 
<EOS>
let
her
rest
,
and
forget
them
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
an
old
church
be
a
dull
and
gloomy
place
for
one
so
young
as
you
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
sir
,
"
return
Nell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
thought
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
see
her
dancing
on
the
green
at
night
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
lay
his
hand
upon
her
head
,
and
smile
sadly
,
"
than
have
her
sit
in
the
shadow
of
our
mouldering
arch
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
look
to
this
,
and
see
that
her
heart
do
not
grow
heavy
among
these
solemn
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Your
request
be
grant
,
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
more
kind
word
,
they
withdraw
,
and
repair
to
the
child
's
house
;
where
they
be
yet
in
conversation
on
their
happy
fortune
,
when
another
friend
appear
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
little
old
gentleman
,
who
live
in
the
parsonage
-
house
,
and
have
reside
there
(
so
they
learn
soon
afterwards
)
<EOS>
ever
since
the
death
of
the
clergyman
's
wife
,
which
have
happen
fifteen
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
his
college
friend
and
always
his
close
companion
;
in
the
first
shock
of
his
grief
he
have
come
to
console
and
comfort
him
;
and
from
that
time
they
have
never
part
company
.
<EOS>
the
little
old
gentleman
be
the
active
spirit
of
the
place
,
the
adjuster
of
all
difference
,
the
promoter
of
all
merry
-
making
,
the
dispenser
of
his
friend
's
bounty
,
and
of
no
small
charity
of
his
own
beside
;
the
universal
mediator
,
comforter
,
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
the
simple
villager
have
care
to
ask
his
name
,
or
,
when
they
know
it
,
to
store
it
in
their
memory
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
from
some
vague
rumour
of
his
college
honour
which
have
be
whisper
abroad
on
his
first
arrival
,
perhaps
because
he
be
an
unmarried
,
unencumbered
gentleman
,
he
have
be
call
the
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
please

as
well

who
with
his
own
hand
have
lay
in
the
stock
of
fuel
which
the
wanderer
have
find
in
their
new
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
the
bachelor
,
then
---
to
call
him
by
his
usual
appellation
---
lift
the
latch
,
show
his
little
round
mild
face
for
a
moment
at
the
door
,
and
step
into
the
room
like
one
who
be
no
stranger
to

<EOS>
"

at

he
take
tenderly

<EOS>
"
You

They

Mr

I

if

"
if

should
be
a

to

here
be
the
one

and
I
hope
you
will
not
spare
him

<EOS>
this

this

Lord

bewail
the
loss
of
his

<EOS>
I
send
the

add
the

in
his
peculiar
whisper

<EOS>
directly
I
hear
of

"
  
have
dispose

<EOS>
thoroughly
persuade

in

that
he
have
make

miserable
by
his
severity

them
with
a

an
admonition
to
walk
quietly
home

without
any
leaping

free
of

you

cold
dull
water

the

admire
and
praise
his
work

shortly
afterwards
depart
;
thinking

as

go
,
how
strange
it
be

that
this

draw
from
his
pursuit

everything
around
him

one
stern
moral

never
contemplate
its
application

while
he
dwell
upon
the
uncertainty

human
life
,
seem
both
in
word

deed
to
deem
himself
immortal

<EOS>
but
her
musing
do
not
stop
here
,
for
she
be
wise
enough
to
think
that
by
a
good
and
merciful
adjustment
this
must
be
human
nature
,
and
that
the
old
sexton
,
with
his
plan

a
type

Its
very
turn
in

awake
a
hollow
sound

when
she
enter
with
a
falter
step
,
the
echo
that
it
raise
in
closing
,
make
her
start
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
peace
of
the
simple

have
move
the

more
strongly

because
of
the
dark
and
troubled
way
that
lie
beyond

and
through
which
she
have
journey
with
such
fail
foot
,
what
be
the
deep
impression
of
find
herself
alone
in
that
solemn
building
,
where
the
very
light

come
through

grey

<EOS>
the

sit
down
,
in
this
old

silent
place

among
the
stark
figure
on
the

they
make
it
more
quiet
there

<EOS>
She
take
a
Bible
from
the
shelf
,
and
read
;
then
,
lay
it
down
,
think
of
the
summer
day
and
the
bright
springtime
that
would
come
---
of
the
ray
of
sun
that
would
fall
in

upon

of
the
leave
that
would
flutter
at

and
play
in
glisten
shadow
on
the
pavement
---
of
the
song
of
bird
,
and
growth
of
bud
and
blossom
out
of
door
---
of
the
sweet
air
,
that
would
steal
in
,
and
gently
wave
the
tattere
banner
overhead

<EOS>
what
if
the
spot
awaken
thought
of
death
!
 
<EOS>
die
who
would
,
it

still
remain
the

these
sight
and
sound
would
still
go
on
,
as
happily
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
pain
to
sleep
amidst
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
leave
the
chapel
---
very
slowly
and
often
turn
back
to
gaze
again
---
and
come
to
a
low
door
,
which
plainly
lead
into
the
tower
,
open
it
,
and
climb
the
wind
stair
in
darkness
;
save
where
she
look
down
,
through
narrow
loophole
,
on
the
place
she
have
leave
,
or
catch
a
glimmer
vision
of
the
dusty
bell
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
she
gain
the
end
of
the
ascent
and
stand
upon
the
turret
top
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
glory
of
the
sudden
burst
of
light
;
the
freshness
of
the
field
and
wood
,
stretch
away
on
every
side
,
and
meet
the
bright
blue
sky
;
the
cattle
graze
in
the
pasturage
;
the
smoke
,
that
,
come
from
among
the
tree
,
seem
to
rise
upward
from
the
green
earth
;
the
child
yet
at
their
gambol
down
below
---
all
,
everything
,
so
beautiful
and
happy
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
pass
from
death
to
life
;
it
be
draw
near
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
be
go
,
when
she
emerge
into
the
porch
,
and
lock
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
pass
the
school
-
house
she
could
hear
the
busy
hum
of
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Her
friend
have
begin
his
labour
only
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
the
noise
grow
louder
,
and
,
look
back
,
she
see
the
boy
come
troop
out
and
disperse
themselves
with
merry
shout
and
play
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
good
thing
,
"
think
the
child
,
"
I
be
very
glad
they
pass
the
church
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
stop
,
to
fancy
how
the
noise
would
sound
inside
,
and
how
gently
it
would
seem
to
die
away
upon
the
ear
.
  
<EOS>
again
that
day
,
yes
,
twice
again
,
she
steal
back
to
the
old
chapel
,
and
in
her
former
seat
read
from
the
same
book
,
or
indulge
the
same
quiet
train
of
thought
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
it
have
grow
dusk
,
and
the
shadow
of
come
night
make
it
more
solemn
still
,
the
child
remain
,
like
one
root
to
the
spot
,
and
have
no
fear
or
thought
of
stir
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
her
there
,
at
last
,
and
take
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
pale
but
very
happy
,
until
they
separate
for
the
night
;
and
then
,
as
the
poor
schoolmaster
stoop
down
to
kiss
her
cheek
,
he
think
he
feel
a
tear
upon
his
face

Chapter

<EOS>
the
bachelor
,
among
his
various
occupation
,
find
in
the
old
church
a
constant
source
of
interest
and
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
take
that
pride
in
it
which
man
conceive
for
the
wonder
of
their
own
little
world
,
he
have
make
its
history
his
study
;
and
many
a
summer
day
within
its
wall
,
and
many
a
winter
's
night
beside
the
parsonage
fire
,
have
find
the
bachelor
still
pore
over
,
and
add
to
,
his
goodly
store
of
tale
and
legend
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
not
one
of
those
rough
spirit
who
would
strip
fair
Truth
of
every
little
shadowy
vestment
in
which
time
and
teem
fancy
love
to
array
her
---
and
some
of
which
become
her
pleasantly
enough
,
serve
,
like
the
water
of
her
well
,
to
add
new
grace
to
the
charm
they
half
conceal
and
half
suggest
,
and
to
awaken
interest
and
pursuit
rather
than
languor
and
indifference
---
<EOS>
as
,
unlike
this
stern
and
obdurate
class
,
he
love
to
see
the
goddess
crown
with
those
garland
of
wild
flower
which
tradition
wreathe
for
her
gentle
wearing
,
and
which
be
often
fresh
in
their
homely
shape
---
he
tread
with
a
light
step
and
bear
with
a
light
hand
upon
the
dust
of
century
,
unwilling
to
demolish
any
of
the
airy
shrine
that
have
be
raise
above
it
,
if
any
good
feeling
or
affection
of
the
human
heart
be
hide
thereabout
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
in
the
case
of
an
ancient
coffin
of
rough
stone
,
suppose
,
for
many
generation
,
to
contain
the
bone
of
a
certain
baron
,
who
,
after
ravage
,
with
cut
,
and
thrust
,
and
plunder
,
in
foreign
land
,
come
back
with
a
penitent
and
sorrow
heart
to
die
at
home
,
but
which
have
be
lately
show
by
learned
antiquary
to
be
no
such
thing
,
as
the
baron
in
question
(
so
they
contend
)
<EOS>
have
die
hard
in
battle
,
gnash
his
tooth
and
curse
with
his
late
breath
<EOS>
---
the
bachelor
stoutly
maintain
that
the
old
tale
be
the
true
one
;
that
the
baron
,
repent
him
of
the
evil
,
have
do
great
charity
and
meekly
give
up
the
ghost
;
and
that
,
if
ever
baron
go
to
heaven
,
that
baron
be
then
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
when
the
aforesaid
antiquary
do
argue
and
contend
that
a
certain
secret
vault
be
not
the
tomb
of
a
grey
-
haired
lady
who
have
be
hang
and
draw
and
quarter
by
glorious
Queen
Bess
for
succour
a
wretched
priest
who
faint
of
thirst
and
hunger
at
her
door
,
the
bachelor
do
solemnly
maintain
,
against
all
comer
,
that
the
church
be
hallow
by
the
say
poor
lady
's
ashe
;
that
her
remain
have
be
collect
in
the
night
from
four
of
the
city
's
gate
,
and
thither
in
secret
bring
,
and
there
deposit
;
and
the
bachelor
do
further
(
be
highly
excited
at
such
time
)
deny
the
glory
of
Queen
Bess
,
and
assert
the
immeasurably
great
glory
of
the
mean
woman
in
her
realm
,
who
have
a
merciful
and
tender
heart
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
assertion
that
the
flat
stone
near
the
door
be
not
the
grave
of
the
miser
who
have
disown
his
only
child
and
leave
a
sum
of
money
to
the
church
to
buy
a
peal
of
bell
,
the
bachelor
do
readily
admit
the
same
,
and
that
the
place
have
give
birth
to
no
such
man
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
would
have
have
every
stone
,
and
plate
of
brass
,
the
monument
only
of
deed
whose
memory
should
survive
.
 
<EOS>
all
other
he
be
willing
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
bury
in
consecrated
ground
,
but
he
would
have
have
them
bury
deep
,
and
never
bring
to
light
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
from
the
lip
of
such
a
tutor
,
that
the
child
learn
her
easy
task
.
 
<EOS>
already
impressed
,
beyond
all
tell
,
by
the
silent
building
and
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
spot
in
which
it
stand
---
majestic
age
surround
by
perpetual
youth
---
it
seem
to
her
,
when
she
hear
these
thing
,
sacred
to
all
goodness
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
another
world
,
where
sin
and
sorrow
never
come
;
a
tranquil
place
of
rest
,
where
nothing
evil
enter
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
bachelor
have
give
her
in
connection
with
almost
every
tomb
and
flat
grave
-
stone
some
history
of
its
own
,
he
take
her
down
into
the
old
crypt
,
now
a
mere
dull
vault
,
and
show
her
how
it
have
be
light
up
in
the
time
of
the
monk
,
and
how
,
amid
lamp
depend
from
the
roof
,
and
swinge
censer
exhale
scented
odour
,
and
habit
glitter
with
gold
and
silver
,
and
picture
,
and
precious
stuff
,
and
jewel
all
flash
and
glisten
through
the
low
arch
,
the
chaunt
of
aged
voice
have
be
many
a
time
hear
there
,
at
midnight
,
in
old
day
,
while
hooded
figure
knelt
and
pray
around
,
and
tell
their
rosary
of
bead
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
,
he
take
her
above
ground
again
,
and
show
her
,
high
up
in
the
old
wall
,
small
gallery
,
where
the
nun
have
be
will
not
to
glide
along
 
---
dimly
see
in
their
dark
dress
so
far
off
---
or
to
pause
like
gloomy
shadow
,
listen
to
the
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
He
show
her
too
,
how
the
warrior
,
whose
figure
rest
on
the
tomb
,
have
wear
those
rot
scrap
of
armour
up
above
---
how
this
have
be
a
helmet
,
and
that
a
shield
,
and
that
a
gauntlet
---
and
how
they
have
wield
the
great
two

handed
sword
,
and

down
,
with
yonder
iron
mace
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
he
tell
the
child
she

in
her
mind
;
and
sometimes
,
when
she
awake
at
night
from
dream
of
those
old
time
,
and
rise
from
her
bed
look
out
at
the
dark
church
,
she
almost
hope
to
see
the
window
light
up
,
and
hear
the
organ
's
swell
,
and
sound
of
voice
,
on
the
rush
wind
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
sexton

,
and
be
about
again
.
 
<EOS>
from
him
the
child

many
other
thing
,
though
of
a
different
kind

<EOS>
He
be
not
able

but
one
day
there
be
a
grave
to
be
make
,
and
he
come
to
overlook
the

He
be
in

grass
at
his
foot
,
with
her
thoughtful

duty
be
a
little
old
than
he

though
much
more
active

<EOS>
but
he

deaf
;
and
when
the
sexton
(
who
peradventure
,
on
a
pinch
,
may
have
walk
a
mile
with
great
difficulty
in
half
-
a

dozen
hour
)
exchange
a
remark
with
him
about
his
work
<EOS>
,
the
child
could
not
help
notice
that
he
do
so
with
an
impatient
kind
of
pity
for
his
infirmity

as
if
he

emotion

what

He

deaf
indeed

petulantly

you
sure
you
be
right
about
the
figure

"
oh
quite
,

the

why
not

"
  
<EOS>

He

deaf

the
sexton
to
himself

<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
get
foolish
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
rather
wonder
what
have
lead
him
to
this
belief
,
as
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
old
man
seem
quite
as
sharp
as
he
,
and
be
infinitely
more
robust
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
sexton
say
nothing
more
just
then
,
however
,
she
forget
it
for
the
time
,
and
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
tell
me
,

she

,

about
your
gardening

do
you
ever

thing
here

in

churchyard

return
the
sexton
,
"
not
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
I
have
see
some
flower
and
little
shrub
about
,
"
the
child
rejoin
;
"
there
be
some
over
there
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
be
of
your
rearing
,
though
indeed
they
grow
but
poorly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
grow
as
Heaven
will
,
"
say
the
old
man
;
"
and
it
kindly
ordain
that
they
shall
never
flourish
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
this
it
be
,
"
say
the
sexton
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
mark
the
grave
of
those
who
have
very
tender
,
love
friend

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
they
do
!

the

exclaim

I
be
very
glad
to
know
they
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
"
return
the
old
man
,
"
but
stay
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
see
how
they
hang
their
head
,
and
droop
,
and
with
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
guess
the
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
the
child
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
the
memory
of
those
who
lie
below
,
pass
away
so
soon
.
<EOS>
at
first
they
tend
them
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
;
they
soon
begin
to
come
less
frequently
;
from
once
a
day
,
to
once
a
week
;
from
once
a
week
to
once
a
month
;
then
,
at
long
and
uncertain
interval
;
then
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
such
token
seldom
flourish
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
the
brief
summer
flower
outlive
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
hear
it
,
"
say
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
so
say
the
gentlefolk
who
come
down
here
to
look
about
them
,

return
the
old
man
,
shake
his
head
,
"

I
say
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pretty
custom
you
have
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
"
they
say
to
me
sometimes
,
"
to
plant
the
grave
,
but
it
be
melancholy
to
see
these
thing
all
wither
or
dead
.
<EOS>
"
I
crave
their
pardon
and
tell
them
that
,
as
I
take
it
,
"
tis
a
good
sign
for
the
happiness
of
the
living
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
the
mourner
learn
to
look
to
the
blue
sky
by
day
,
and
to
the
star
by
night
,
and
to
think
that
the
dead
be
there
,

not
in
grave
,
"
say
the
child
in
an
earnest
voice
.
  
<EOS>

perhaps
so
,

reply
the
old
man
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>

It
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
whether
it
be
as
I
believe
it
be
,

no
,
"
think
the
child
within
herself
,
"
I
will
make
this
place
my
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
no
harm
at

to
work
here
day
by
day

pleasant
thought
will
come
of
it

I
be
sure

"
  
<EOS>
Her
glow
cheek
and
moisten
eye
pass
unnoticed
by
the
sexton
,
who
turn
towards
old
David
,
and
call
him
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
Becky
Morgan
's
age
still
trouble
him
;
though
why
,
the
child
could
scarcely
understand
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
or
third
repetition
of
his
name
attract
the
old
man
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
pause
from
his
work
,
he
lean
on
his
spade
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
dull
ear

do
you
call

he

I

old

seventy

shake
of

the
sexton

aye

Davy

woman

not

tell
the
truth

their
age

eye

right

call
to

long

seventy

nine

human
vanity

"
  
<EOS>
the
other
old
man
be
not
behindhand
with
some
moral
reflection
on
this
fruitful
theme
,
and
both
adduce
a
mass
of
evidence
,
of
such
weight
as
to
render
it
doubtful
---
not
whether
the
deceased
be
of
the
age
suggest
,
but
whether
she
have
not
almost
reach
the
patriarchal
term
of
a
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
settle
this
question
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
,
the
sexton
,
with
his
friend
's
assistance
,
rise
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
chilly
,
sit
here

I
must
be
careful

the
summer

limp
away

what

ask

David

He

very
fast

He
age
every

<EOS>
and
so
they
part
;
each
persuade
that
the
other
have
less
life
in
him
than
himself
;

both
greatly
console
and
comfort
by
the
little
fiction
they
have
agree
upon

respect
Becky
Morgan

whose
decease
be
no

a
precedent
of
uncomfortable
application

would
be
no

half
a
score

<EOS>
the

remain
,
for
some
minute

watch
the
deaf
old
man
as
he
throw
out
the
earth
with
his
shovel

and
,
often
stop
to
cough

fetch
his
breath

to
himself

sober
chuckle

at
length
she
turn
away

full
of

take
his

it
between

who
so
delight
as

,
when
they
next
day
begin
their
labour
!
 
<EOS>
who
so
unconscious
of
all
association
connect
with
the
spot

as
he
!
 
<EOS>
They
pluck
the
long
grass

nettle
from
the
tomb

thin
the
poor
shrub

root
,
make
the
turf
smooth

clear
it
of

<EOS>
They
be
yet
in
the
ardour
of
their
work
,
when
the
child
,
raise
her
head
from
the
ground
over
which
she
bend
,
observe
that
the
bachelor
be
sit
on
the
stile

by

in

the
little
gentleman

to
Nell

curtsey
to
him

"
have
you
do
all
that

this
morning

It

"
good

good
work

do
you

We
shall
come

Nell
,
turn
her
head
aside
,
and
speak
softly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
slight
incident
,
and
may
have
be
design
or
accident
,
or
the
child
's
unconscious
sympathy
with
youth
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
strike
upon
her
grandfather
,
though
he
have
not
notice
it
before
.
<EOS>
He
look
in
@
hurried
manner
at
the
grave
,
then
anxiously
at
the
child
,
then
press
her
to
his
side

bade
her
stop
to
rest
.
<EOS>
something
he
have
long
forget
,
appear
to
struggle
faintly
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
pass
away
,
as
weighty
thing
have
do
;
but
come
uppermost
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
many
time
that
day
,
and
often
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
while
they
be
yet
at
work
,
the
child
,
see
that
he
often
turn
and
look
uneasily
at
her
,
as
though
he
be
try
to
resolve
some
painful
doubt
or
collect
some
scatter
thought
,
urge
him
to
tell
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
it
be
nothing
---
nothing
---
and
,
lay
her
head
upon
his
arm
,
pat
her
fair
cheek
with
his
hand
,
and
mutter
that
she
grow
strong
every
day
,
and
would
be
a
woman

soon

Chapter
55
    
from
that
time
,
there
spring
up
in
the
old
man
's
mind
,
a
solicitude
about
the
child
which
never
sleep
or
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
chord
in
the
human
heart
---
strange
,
vary
string
---
which
be
only
strike
by
accident
;
which
will
remain
mute
and
senseless
to
appeal
the
most
passionate
and
earnest
,
and
respond
at
last
to
the
slight
casual
touch
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
most
insensible
or
childish
mind
,
there
be
some
train
of
reflection
which
art
can
seldom
lead
,
or
skill
assist
,
but
which
will
reveal
itself
,
as
great
truth
have
do
,
by
chance
,
and
when
the
discoverer
have
the
plain
end
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
the
old
man
never
,
for
a
moment
,
forget
the
weakness
and
devotion
of
the
child
;
from
the
time
of
that
slight
incident
,
he
who
have
see
her
toiling
by
his
side
through
so
much
difficulty
and
suffering
,
and
have
scarcely
think
of
her
otherwise
than
as
the
partner
of
misery
which
he
feel
severely
in
his
own
person
,
and
deplore
for
his
own
sake
at
least
as
much
as
her
,
awake
to
a
sense
of
what
he
owe
her
,
and
what
those
misery
have
make
her
.
<EOS>
never
,
no
,
never
once
,
in
one
unguarded
moment
from
that
time
to
the
end
,
do
any
care
for
himself
,
any
thought
of
his
own
comfort
,
any
selfish
consideration
or
regard
distract
his
thought
from
the
gentle
object
of
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
follow
her
up
and
down
,
wait
till
she
should
tire
and
lean
upon
his
arm
---
he
would
sit
opposite
to
her
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
content
to
watch
,
and
look
,
until
she
raise
her
head
and
smile
upon
him
as
of
old
<EOS>
---
he
would
discharge
by
stealth
,
those
household
duty
which
task
her
power
too
heavily
---
he
would
rise
,
in
the
cold
dark
night
,
to
listen
to
her
breathing
in
her
sleep
,
and
sometimes
crouch
for
hour
by
her
bedside
only
to
touch
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
who
know
all
,
can
only
know
what
hope
,
and
fear
,
and
thought
of
deep
affection
,
be
in
that
one
disorder
brain
,
and
what
a
change
have
fall
on
the
poor
old
man
.
<EOS>
sometimes
---
week
have
creep
on
,
then
---
the
child
,
exhaust
,
though
with
little
fatigue
,
would
pass
whole
evening
on
a
couch
beside
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
the
schoolmaster
would
bring
in
book
,
and
read
to
her
aloud
;
and
seldom
an
evening
pass
,
but
the
bachelor
come
in
,
and
take
his
turn
of
reading
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
sit
and
listen
---
with
little
understanding
for
the
word
,
but
with
his
eye
fix
upon
the
child
---
and
if
she
smile
or
brighten
with
the
story
,
he
would
say
it
be
a
good
one
,
and
conceive
a
fondness
for
the
very
book
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
in
their
evening
talk
,
the
bachelor
tell
some
tale
that
please
her
(
as
his
tale
be
sure
to
do
)
,
the
old
man
would
painfully
try
to
store
it
in
his
mind
;
nay
,
when
the
bachelor
leave
them
,
he
would
sometimes
slip
out
after
him
,
and
humbly
beg
that
he
would
tell
him
such
a
part
again
,
that
he
may
learn
to
win
a
smile
from
Nell
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
be
rare
occasion
,
happily
;
for
the
child
yearn
to
be
out
of
door
,
and
walk
in
her
solemn
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Parties
,
too
,
would
come
to
see
the
church
;
and
those
who
come
,
speak
to
other
of
the
child
,
send
more
;
so
even
at
that
season
of
the
year
they
have
visitor
almost
daily
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
would
follow
them
at
a
little
distance
through
the
building
,
listen
to
the
voice
he
love
so
well
;
and
when
the
stranger
leave
,
and
part
from
Nell
,
he
would
mingle
with
them
to
catch
up
fragment
of
their
conversation
;
or
he
would
stand
for
the
same
purpose
,
with
his
grey
head
uncover
,
at
the
gate
as
they
pass
through
.
  
<EOS>
They
always
praise
the
child
,
her
sense
and
beauty
,
and
he
be
proud
to
hear
them
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
that
,
so
often
add
,
which
wring
his
heart
,
and
make
him
sob
and
weep
alone
,
in
some
dull
corner
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
even
careless
stranger
---
they
who
have
no
feeling
for
her
,
but
the
interest
of
the
moment
---
they
who
would
go
away
and
forget
next
week
that
such
a
be
live
---
even
they
see
it
---
even
they
pity
her
---
even
they
bade
him
good
day
compassionately
,
and
whisper
as
they
pass
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
village
,
too
,
of
whom
there
be
not
one
but
grow
to
have
a
fondness
for
poor
Nell
;
even
among
them
,
there
be
the
same
feeling
;
a
tenderness
towards
her
---
a
compassionate
regard
for
her
,
increase
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
schoolboys
,
light
-
hearted
and
thoughtless
as
they
be
,
even
they
care
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
roughest
among
them
be
sorry
if
he
miss
her
in
the
usual
place
upon
his
way
to
school
,
and
would
turn
out
of
the
path
to
ask
for
her
at
the
lattice
window
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
be
sit
in
the
church
,
they
perhaps
may
peep
in
softly
at
the
open
door
;
but
they
never
speak
to
her
,
unless
she
rise
and
go
to
speak
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
some
feeling
be
abroad
which
raise
the
child
above
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
when
Sunday
come
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
poor
country
people
in
the
church
,
for
the
castle
in
which
the
old
family
have
live
,
be
an
empty
ruin
,
and
there
be
none
but
humble
folk
for
seven
mile
around
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
as
elsewhere
,
they
have
an
interest
in
Nell
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
gather
round
her
in
the
porch
,
before
and
after
service
;
young
child
would
cluster
at
her
skirt
;
and
aged
man
and
woman
forsake
their
gossip
,
to
give
her
kindly
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
them
,
young
or
old
,
thought
of
pass
the
child
without
a
friendly
word
.
 
<EOS>
many
who
come
from
three
or
four
mile
distant
,
bring
her
little
present
;
the
humble
and
rudest
have
good
wish
to
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
seek
out
the
young
child
whom
she
first
see
play
in
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
---
he
who
have
speak
of
his
brother
---
be
her
little
favourite
and
friend
,
and
often
sit
by
her
side
in
the
church
,
or
climb
with
her
to
the
tower
-
top
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
delight
to
help
her
,
or
to
fancy
that
he
do
so
,
and
they
soon
become
close
companion
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
,
that
,
as
she
be
read
in
the
old
spot
by
herself
one
day
,
this
child
come
run
in
with
his
eye
full
of
tear
,
and
after
hold
her
from
him
,
and
look
at
her
eagerly
for
a
moment
,
clasp
his
little
arm
passionately
about
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
now
?
"
say
Nell
,
soothe
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter

"
  
<EOS>
"
She

still
more
closely

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
not

"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
wonderingly
,
and
put
his
hair
back
from
his
face
,
and
kiss
him
,
ask
what
he
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

not

Nell

cry
the
boy

<EOS>
"
We

<EOS>
the
child
drop
her
head
,
and
put
her
hand
before
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
bear
the
thought

<EOS>
cry
the

exult
through
his
tear

"
You

You

Pray

"
  
<EOS>
the
little
creature
fold
his
hand
,
and
kneel
down
at
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
look
at
me

Nell

say
the

and
tell
me
that

no

will
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
still
the
drooping
head
and
hide
face
,
and
the
child
quite
silent
---
save
for
her
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
a
time
,

pursue
the
boy

try
to
draw
away
her

will
be
glad

Willy
go

at
night

he
never

have
leave

I
be
sure

the

a

hour

alone
in

Temple
of
Probity

his
hat
upon
the
desk
,
and
take
from
his
pocket
a
small
parcel
of
black
crape
,
apply
himself
to
fold
and
pin
the

upon
it

after
the
manner
of

have
complete
the
construction
of
this
appendage
,
he
survey
his
work
with
great
complacency
,
and
put
his
hat
on
again
---
very
much
over
one
eye
,
to
increase
the
mournfulness
of
the
effect
.
 
<EOS>
these
arrangement
perfect
to
his
entire
satisfaction
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket

up

'
twa
the
first
to
fade
away
;
I
never
nurse
a
dear
Gazelle
,
to
glad
me
with
its
soft
black
eye
,
but
when
it
come
to
know
me
well
,
and
love
me
,
it
be
sure
to
marry
a
market
-
gardener

"
  
<EOS>
overpower
by
these
reflection
,
Mr

short
at

fling
himself
into
its
open
arm

Mr

with

of

add
Richard
,
take
off
his
hat
again
and
look
hard
at
it
,
as
if
he
be
only
deter
by
pecuniary
consideration
from
spurn
it
with
his
foot
,
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wear
this

<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
to
observe
,
lest
there
should
appear
any
incongruity
in
the
close
of
this
soliloquy
,
that
Mr
Swiveller
do
not
wind
up
with
a
cheerful
hilarious
laugh
,
which
would
have
be
undoubtedly
at
variance
with
his
solemn
reflection
,
but
that
,
be
in
a
theatrical
mood
,
he
merely
achieve
that
performance
which
be
designate
in
melodramas
"
laugh
like
a

<EOS>

for
it
seem
that
your
fiend
always
laugh
in
syllable

always
in
three
syllable

never
more

less

which
be
a

there

a
ring

,
if
we
may
adapt
the
sound
to

of
meekness
than
be
perhaps
quite
consistent
with
his
late
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
,
hear
the
same
sound
,
cause
his
stool
to
revolve
rapidly
on
one
leg
until
it
bring
him
to
his
desk
,
into
which
,
have
forget
in
the
sudden
flurry
of
his
spirit
to
part
with
the
poker
,
he
thrust
it
as
he
cry
"
come
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
who
should
present
himself
but
that
very
kit
who
have
be
the
theme
of
Mr
Chuckster
's
wrath
!
 
<EOS>
never
do
man
pluck
up
his
courage
so
quickly
,
or
look
so
fierce
,
as
Mr
Chuckster
when
he
find
it
be
he
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
stare
at
him
for
a
moment
,
and
then
leap
from
his
stool
,
and
draw
out
the
poker
from
its
place
of
concealment
,
perform
the
broad
-
sword
exercise
with
all
the
cut
and
guard
complete
,
in
a
species
of
frenzy
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
gentleman
at
home
?
"
say
kit
,
rather
astonish
by
this
uncommon
reception
.
  
<EOS>
before
Mr
Swiveller
could
make
any
reply
,
Mr
Chuckster
take
occasion
to
enter
his
indignant
protest
against
this
form
of
inquiry
;
which
he
hold
to
be
of
a
disrespectful
and
snobbish
tendency
,
inasmuch
as
the
inquirer
,
see
two
gentleman
then
and
there
present
,
should
have
speak
of
the
other
gentleman
;
or
rather
(
for
it
be
not
impossible
that
the
object
of
his
search
may
be
of
inferior
quality
)
should
have
mention
his
name
,
leave
it
to
his
hearer
to
determine
his
degree
as
they
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuckster
likewise
remark
,
that
he
have
some
reason
to
believe
this
form
of
address
be
personal
to
himself
,
and
that
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
trifle
with
---
<EOS>
as
certain
snob
(
whom
he
do
not
more
particularly
mention
or
describe
)
may
find
to
their
cost
.

<EOS>
the
excessive
audacity
of
this
retort
so
overpower
Mr
Chuckster

so
move
his
tender

honour

that

by
official

annihilate

the
affront

he
do
consider

under
the
extraordinary
circumstance
of
aggravation
attend
it

<EOS>
could
but
have
meet
with
the
proper
sanction

approval
of
a
jury
of
Englishmen
,
who
,
he
have
no
doubt
,
would
have
return
a
verdict
of
justifiable
Homicide

high
testimony

the
Avenger

Mr

without

so
hot
upon

puzzle
how
to
act
<EOS>
(

tranquillise
their

musical

certain
vocal
snatch

reference

Mr

certainly
the
friendship

the
single

and
Mr

be
not
suffer
to

but
have
a
rapid
growth
and
flourish
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
soon
in
habit
of
constant
intercourse
and
communication
;
and
the
single
gentleman
labour
at
this
time
under
a
slight
attack
of
illness
---
the
consequence
most
probably
of
his
late
excited
feeling
and
subsequent
disappointment
---
furnish
a
reason
for
their
holding
yet
more
frequent
correspondence
;
so
that
some
one
of
the
inmate
of
Abel
Cottage
,
Finchley
,
come
backwards

forwards
between

almost

the
clatter

at

corner
of

whenever

so

over

Mr

little
table
to
his
bedside

a
small
oblong
music
-
book
to
the
good

most
mournfully

a
composition
,
which

when
it
be

very
slowly
on
the
flute

in
bed
,
with
the
further
disadvantage
of
be
perform
by
a
gentleman
but
imperfectly
acquaint
with
the
instrument
,
who
repeat
one
note
a
great
many
time
before

,
for
half
the
night
,
or
more
,
Mr
Swiveller
,
lie
sometimes
on
his
back
with
his
eye
upon
the
ceiling
,
and
sometimes
half
out
of
bed
to
correct
himself
by
the
book
,
play
this
unhappy
tune
over
and
over
again
;
never
leave
off
,
save
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
to
take
breath
and
soliloquise
about
the
Marchioness
,
and
then
begin
again
with
renew
vigour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
have
quite
exhaust
his
several
subject
of
meditation
,
and
have
breathe
into
the
flute
the
whole
sentiment
of
the
purl
down
to
its
very
dreg
,
and
have
nearly
madden
the
people
of
the
house
,
and
at
both
the
next
door
,
and
over
the
way
---
that
he
shut
up
the
music
-
book
,
extinguish
the
candle
,
and
find
himself
greatly
lighten
and
relieve
in
his
mind
,
turn
round
and
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
He
awake
in
the
morning
,

refresh
;
and
have
take
half
an
hour
's
exercise
at
the
flute

a
notice
to

from
his

mild

<EOS>
Mr

by
a
nod
,
and
exchange
his
coat
for
the
aquatic

which

for
in
consequence
of
a
tightness
in

<EOS>
Mr

clap
his

It

Miss

,
pull
out
the
tin

refresh
herself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff

Jove

down

for

<EOS>
the
more
he
discuss
the
subject
in
his
thought
,
the
more
probable
it
appear
to
Dick
that
the
miserable
little
servant
be
the
culprit
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
consider
on
what
a

allowance
of
food

how
neglect

untaught
she

how

sharpen
by
necessity

privation

it

her
so
much

so
unwilling

have
a
matter
of
such
gravity
disturb
the
oddity
of
their
acquaintance

that
he

think
truly

that
rather
than

fifty
pound
down

he
would
have
the
Marchioness
prove
innocent

<EOS>
while

serious
meditation
upon

Miss

her
head

great
mystery

doubt

when
the
voice

carol
a
cheerful
strain

passage

to
acquaint

as

do
so

ply
her
snuff

box
at

wasteful
rate

instead

he
walk
on
tiptoe
to

Mr

painful
circumstance

the
fact

several
small
sum
from

Sally

Mr

<EOS>
as
Sampson
speak
,
he
lay
the
bank

note
upon
the
desk
among
some
paper

in
an
absent
manner

thrust
his
hand
into

<EOS>
with
that
,
Mr
Brass
pat
him
twice
or
thrice
on
the
shoulder
,
in
a
most
friendly
manner
,

entreat
him
to
believe

much
faith

although
at
another

look
upon

as
a
doubtful

he

under

a
great
relief

assure

Mr

him
by

brown
study

do
Miss

Richard
too
remain
in
a
thoughtful
state

fear
every
moment
to
hear
the
Marchioness
impeach
,
and
unable
to
resist
the
conviction
that
she
must
be
guilty

<EOS>
when
they
have
severally
remain
in
this
condition
for
some
minute
,
Miss
Sally
all
at
once
give
a
loud
rap
upon
the
desk
with
her
clenched
fist
,
and
cry
,

break
suddenly

Mind

whatever
come

you

now

do
this

strike
you

rather
a

it
not

be
it
at
all
a
treacherous
case

do
you
think

be
it
one

perhaps

gentleman

if

have
not

you
would
have

"
  
<EOS>
with
such
pacific
and
bantering
remark
do
Mr
Brass
refute
the
foul
aspersion
on
his
character
;
but
the
virtuous
Sarah
,
move
by
strong
feeling
,
and
have
at
heart
,
perhaps
,
a
more
jealous
regard
for
the
honour
of
her
family
,
fly
from
her
brother
's
side
,
without
any
previous
intimation
of
her
design
,
and
dart
at
the
prisoner
with
the
utmost
fury
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
undoubtedly
have
go
hard
with
kit
's
face
,
but
that
the
wary
constable
,
foresee
her
design
,
draw
him
aside
at
the
critical
moment
,
and
thus
place
Mr
Chuckster
in
circumstance
of
some
jeopardy
;
for
that
gentleman
happen
to
be
next
the
object
of
Miss
Brass
's
wrath
;
and
rage
being
,
like
love
and
fortune
,
blind
;
be
pounce
upon
by
the
fair
enslaver
,
and
have
a
false
collar
pluck
up
by
the
root
,
and
his
hair
very
much
dishevelled
,
before
the
exertion
of
the

make
her
sensible
of
her
mistake

the

take
warning
by
this
desperate

that

if

after

Mr

the

return

out

to

so
very
material

Chapter
61
    
let
moralist
and
philosopher
say
what
they
may
,
it
be
very
questionable
whether
a
guilty
man
would
have
feel
half
as
much
misery
that
night
,
as
kit
do
,
be
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
,
be
in
the
constant
commission
of
vast
quantity
of
injustice
,
be
a
little
too
apt
to
comfort
itself
with
the
idea
that
if
the
victim
of
its
falsehood
and
malice
have
a
clear
conscience
,
he
can
not
fail
to
be
sustain
under
his
trial
,
and
somehow
or
other
to
come
right
at
last
;
"
in
which
case
,
"
say
they
who
have
hunt
him
down
,
"
---
though
we
certainly
do
not
expect
it
---
nobody
will
be
better
pleased
than
we
.
"
 
<EOS>
Whereas
,
the
world
would
do
well
to
reflect
,
that
injustice
be
in
itself
,
to
every
generous
and
properly
constitute
mind
,
an
injury
,
of
all
other
the
most
insufferable
,
the
most
torturing
,
and
the
most
hard
to
bear
;
and
that
many
clear
conscience
have
go
to
their
account
elsewhere
,
and
many
sound
heart
have
break
,
because
of
this
very
reason
;
the
knowledge
of
their
own
desert
only
aggravate
their
suffering
,
and
render
them
the
less
endurable
.
  
<EOS>
the
world
,
however
,
be
not
in
fault
in
kit
's
case
.
 
<EOS>
but
Kit
be
innocent
;
and
know
this
,
and
feeling
that
his
good
friend
deem
him
guilty
---
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Garland
would
look
upon
him
as
a
monster
of
ingratitude
---
that
Barbara
would
associate
him
with
all
that
be
bad
and
criminal
---
that
the
pony
would
consider
himself
forsaken
---
and
that
even
his
own
mother
may
perhaps
yield
to
the
strong
appearance
against
him
,
and
believe
him
to
be
the
wretch
he
seem
---
know
and
feel
all
this
<EOS>
,
he
experience
,
at
first
,
an
agony
of
mind
which
no
word
can
describe
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
little
cell
in
which
he
be
lock
up
for
the
night
,
almost
beside
himself
with
grief
.
  
<EOS>
even
when
the
violence
of
these
emotion
have
in
some
degree
subside
,
and
he
be
begin
to
grow
more
calm
<EOS>
,
there
come
into
his
mind
a
new
thought
,
the
anguish
of
which
be
scarcely
less
.
<EOS>
the
child
---
the
bright
star
of
the
simple
fellow
's
life
---
she
,
who
always
come
back
upon
him
like
a
beautiful
dream
---
who
have
make
the
poor
part
of
his
existence
,
the
happy
and
good
---
who
have
ever
be
so
gentle
,
and
considerate
,
and
good
---
if
she
be
ever
to
hear
of
this
,
what
would
she
think
!
 
<EOS>
as
this
idea
occur
to
him
,
the
wall
of
the
prison
seem
to
melt
away
,
and
the
old
place
to
reveal
itself
in
their
stead
,
as
it
be
will
not
to
be
on
winter
night
---
the
fireside
,
the
little
supper
table
,
the
old
man
's
hat
,
and
coat
,
and
stick
---
the
half
-
open
door
,
lead
to
her
little
room
<EOS>
---
they
be
all
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
Nell
herself
be
there
,
and
he
---
both
laugh
heartily
as
they
have
often
do
---
and
when
he
have
get
as
far
as
this
,
kit
could
go
no
farther
,
but
fling
himself
upon
his
poor
bedstead
and
weep
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
night
,
which
seem
as
though
it
would
have
no
end
;
but
he
sleep
too
,
and
dream
---
always
of
be
at
liberty
,
and
rove
about
,
now
with
one
person
and
now
with
another
,
but
ever
with
a
vague
dread
of
be
recall
to
prison
;
not
that
prison
,
but
one
which
be
in
itself
a
dim
idea
---
not
of
a
place
,
but
of
a
care
and
sorrow
:
of
something
oppressive
and
always
present
,
and
yet
impossible
to
define
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
morning
dawn
,
and
there
be
the
jail
itself
---
cold
,
black
,
and
dreary
,
and
very
real
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
be
leave
to
himself
,
however
,
and
there
be
comfort
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
liberty
to
walk
in
a
small
paved
yard
at
a
certain
hour
,
and
learn
from
the
turnkey
,
who
come
to
unlock
his
cell
and
show
him
where
to
wash
,
that
there
be
a
regular
time
for
visit
,
every
day
,
and
that
if
any
of
his
friend
come
to
see
him
,
he
would
be
fetch
down
to
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
give
him
this
information
,
and
a
tin
porringer
contain
his
breakfast
,
the
man
lock
him
up
again
;
and
go
clatter
along
the
stone
passage
,
opening
and
shut
a
great
many
other
door
,
and
raise
numberless
loud
echo
which
resound
through
the
building
for
a
long
time
,
as
if
they
be
in
prison
too
,
and
unable
to
get
out
.
  
<EOS>
this
turnkey
have
give
him
to
understand
that
he
be
lodge
,
like
some
few
other
in
the
jail
,
apart
from
the
mass
of
prisoner
;
because
he
be
not
suppose
to
be
utterly
depraved
and
irreclaimable
,
and
have
never
occupy
apartment
in
that
mansion
before
.
 
<EOS>
kit
be
thankful
for
this
indulgence
,
and
sit
read
the
church
catechism
very
attentively
(
though
he
have
know
it
by
heart
from
a
little
child
)
,
until
he
hear
the
key
in
the
lock
,
and
the
man
enter
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
then
,
"
he
say
,
"
come
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
to
,
Sir
?
"
ask
Kit
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
content
himself
by
briefly
reply
"
Wisitors
;
"
and
take
him
by
the
arm
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
the
constable
have
do
the
day
before
,
lead
him
,
through
several
wind
way
and
strong
gate
,
into
a
passage
,
where
he
place
him
at
a
grating
and
turn
upon
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
this
grating
,
at
the
distance
of
about
four
or
five
foot
,
be
another
exactly
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
space
between
,
sit
a
turnkey
read
a
newspaper
,
and
outside
the
further
rail
,
kit
see
,
with
a
palpitate
heart
,
his
mother
with
the
baby
in
her
arm
;
Barbara
's
mother
with
her
never
-
fail
umbrella
;
and
poor
little
Jacob
,
stare
in
with
all
his
might
,
as
though
he
be
look
for
the
bird
,
or
the
wild
beast
,
and
think
the
man
be
mere
accident
with
whom
the
bar
could
have
no
possible
concern
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
little
Jacob
see
his
brother
,
and
,
thrust
his
arm
between
the
rail
to
hug
him
,
find
that
he
come
no
nearer
,
but
still
stand
afar
off
with
his
head
rest
on
the
arm
by
which
he
hold
to
one
of
the
bar
,
he
begin
to
cry
most
piteously
;
whereupon
,
Kit
's
mother
and
Barbara
's
mother
,
who
have
restrain
themselves
as
much
as
possible
,
burst
out
sob
and
weep
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
poor
kit
could
not
help
join
them
,
and
not
one
of
them
could
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
melancholy
pause
,
the
turnkey
read
his
newspaper
with
a
waggish
look
(
he
have
evidently
get
among
the
facetious
paragraph
)
until
,
happen
to
take
his
eye
off
for
an
instant
,
<EOS>
as
if
to
get
by
dint
of
contemplation
at
the
very
marrow
of
some
joke
of
a
deep
sort
than
the
rest
,
it
appear
to
occur
to
him
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
somebody
be
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
now

he

look
round
with

get
with
great
convenience
at

the

cruel

<EOS>
He
have
come
to
look
upon
felony
as
a
kind
of
disorder

like
the
scarlet

erysipela

some

it

in

feel
that

by

further
draught

strong

find
that

instead

at
all
contribute
to
his
recovery

they
have
the
novel
effect
of
make
the
counting

house
spin
round

round

extreme
velocity

cause
the
floor

ceiling

heave

distressing

after

stupor

first
impression

night

<EOS>
the
professional
gentleman
who
have
give
kit
the
consolatory
piece
of
information
relative
to
the
settlement
of
his
trifle
of
business
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
the
probability
of
its
be
very
soon
dispose
of
,
turn
out
to
be
quite
correct
in
his
prognostication
.
 
<EOS>
in
eight
day
'
time
,
the
session
commence
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
day
afterwards
,
the
Grand
jury
find
a
true
Bill
against
Christopher
Nubbles
for
felony
;
and
in
two
day
from
that
finding
,
the
aforesaid
Christopher
Nubbles
be
call
upon
to
plead
Guilty
or
not
guilty
to
an
Indictment
for
that
he
<EOS>
the
say
Christopher
do
feloniously
abstract
and
steal
from
the
dwelling
-
house
and
office
of
one
Sampson
Brass
,
gentleman
,
one
Bank
Note
for
five
pound
issue
by
the
Governor
and
Company
of
the
Bank
of
England
;
in
contravention
of
the
Statutes
in
that
case
make
and
provide
,
and
against
the
peace
of
our
Sovereign
Lord
the
King
,
his
crown
and
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
indictment
,
Christopher
Nubbles
,
in
a
low
and
trembling
voice
,
plead
not
guilty
;
and
here
,
let
those
who
be
in
the
habit
of
form
hasty
judgment
from
appearance
,
and
who
would
have
have
Christopher
,
if
innocent
,
speak
out
very
strong
and
loud
,
observe
,
<EOS>
that
confinement
and
anxiety
will
subdue
the
stout
heart
;
and
that
to
one
who
have
be
close
shut
up
,
though
it
be
only
for
ten
or
eleven
day
,
seeing
but
stone
wall
and
a
very
few
stony
face
,
the
sudden
entrance
into
a
great
hall
fill
with
life
,
be
a
rather
disconcert
and
startling
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
it
must
be
add
,
that
life
in
a
wig
be
to
a
large
class
of
people
much
more
terrifying
and
impressive
than
life
with
its
own
head
of
hair
;
and
if
,
in
addition
to
these
consideration
,
there
be
take
into
account
Kit
's
natural
emotion
on
see
the
two
Mr
Garlands
and
the
little
Notary
look
on
with
pale
and
anxious
face
,
it
will
perhaps
seem
matter
of
no
very
great
wonder
that
he
should
have
be
rather
out
of
sort
,
and
unable
to
make
himself
quite
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
although
he
have
never
see
either
of
the
Mr
Garlands
,
or
Mr
Witherden
,
since
the
time
of
his
arrest
,
he
have
be
give
to
understand
that
they
have
employ
counsel
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
one
of
the
gentleman
in
wig
get
up
and
say
"
I
be
for
the
prisoner
,
my
Lord
,
"
kit
make
him
a
bow
;
and
when
another
gentleman
in
a
wig
get
up
and
say
"
<EOS>
and
I
be
against
him
,
my
Lord
,
"
kit
tremble
very
much
,
and
bow
to
him
too
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
not
he
hope
in
his
own
heart
that
his
gentleman
be
a
match
for
the
other
gentleman
,
and
would
make
him
ashamed
of
himself
in
no
time
!
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
be
against
him
have
to
speak
first
,
and
be
in
dreadfully
good
spirit
<EOS>
(
for
he
have
,
in
the
last
trial
,
very
nearly
procure
the
acquittal
of
a
young
gentleman
who
have
have
the
misfortune
to
murder
his
father
)
<EOS>
he
speak
up
,
you
may
be
sure
;
tell
the
jury
that
if
they
acquit
this
prisoner
they
must
expect
to
suffer
no
less
pang
and
agony
than
he
have
tell
the
other
jury
they
would
certainly
undergo
if
they
convict
that
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
tell
them
all
about
the
case
,
and
that
he
have
never
know
a
bad
case
,
he
stop
a
little
while
,
like
a
man
who
have
something
terrible
to
tell
them
,
and
then
say
that
he
understand
an
attempt
would
be
make
by
his
learned
friend
(
and
here
he
look
sideways
at
Kit
's
gentleman
)
to
impeach
the
testimony
of
those
immaculate
witness
whom
he
should
call
before
them
;
but
he
do
hope
and
trust
that
his
learn
friend
would
have
a
great
respect
and
veneration
for
the
character
of
the
prosecutor
;
than
whom
,
as
he
well
know
,
there
do
not
exist
,
and
never
have
exist
,
a
more
honourable
member
of
that
most
honourable
profession
to
which
he
be
attach
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
say
,
do
the
jury
know
Bevis
Marks
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
they
do
know
Bevis
Marks
(
as
he
trust
for
their
own
character
,
they
do
)
<EOS>
do
they
know
the
historical
and
elevate
association
connect
with
that
most
remarkable
spot
?
 
<EOS>
do
they
believe
that
a
man
like
Brass
could
reside
in
a
place
like
Bevis
Marks
,
and
not
be
a
virtuous
and
most
upright
character
?
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
say
a
great
deal
to
them
on
this
point
,
he
remember
that
it
be
an
insult
to
their
understanding
to
make
any
remark
on
what
they
must
have
feel
so
strongly
without
him
,
and
therefore
call
Sampson
Brass
into
the
witness
-
box
,
straightway
.
  
<EOS>
then
up
come
Mr
Brass
,
very
brisk
and
fresh
;
and
,
have
bow
to
the
judge
,
like
a
man
who
have
have
the
pleasure
of
see
him
before
,
and
who
hope
he
have
be
pretty
well
since
their
last
meeting
,
fold
his
arm
,
and
look
at
his
gentleman
as
much
as
to
say
"
here
I
be
---
full
of
evidence
---
tap
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
gentleman
do
tap
him
presently
,
and
with
great
discretion
too
;
draw
off
the
evidence
by
little
and
little
,
and
make
it
run
quite
clear
and
bright
in
the
eye
of
all
present
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
Kit
's
gentleman
take
him
in
hand
,
but
can
make
nothing
of
him
;
and
after
a
great
many
very
long
question
and
very
short
answer
,
Mr
Sampson
Brass
go
down
in
glory
.
  
<EOS>
to
him
succeed
Sarah
,
who
in
like
manner
be
easy
to
be
manage
by
Mr
Brass
's
gentleman
,
but
very
obdurate
to
Kit
's
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Kit
's
gentleman
can
get
nothing
out
of
her
but
a
repetition
of
what
she
have
say
before
(
only
a
little
strong
this
time
,
as
against
his
client
)
,
and
therefore
let
her
go
,
in
some
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
Mr
Brass
's
gentleman
call
Richard
Swiveller
,
and
Richard
Swiveller
appear
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Mr
Brass
's
gentleman
have
it
whisper
in
his
ear
that
this
witness
be
dispose
to
be
friendly
to
the
prisoner
---
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
rather
glad
to
hear
,
as
his
strength
be
consider
to
lie
in
what
be
familiarly
term
badger
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
he
begin
by
request
the
officer
to
be
quite
sure
that
this
witness
kiss
the
book
,
then
go
to
work
at

tooth
and
nail

"

when

Sir

quite

<EOS>
It
be
terrible
drudgery

shocking

<EOS>
I
should
say
,
now
,
that
the
stage

the

the

,
Mr

something
very
superior

the

call

you
will
look
in

I

<EOS>
there
be
a
crack
window
sir

I
have
not

any
deduction

<EOS>
whenever

let
us
part

"
  
<EOS>
to
all
these
rambling
observation

Mr

answer
not
one
word
,
but
,
return
for
the
aquatic
jacket
,
roll
it
into
a
tight
round
ball
:
look
steadily
at
Brass
meanwhile
as
if
he
have
some
intention
of
bowl
him
down
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
take
it
under
his
arm
,
however
,
and
march
out
of
the
office
in
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
close
the
door
,
he
re
-
open
it
,
stare
in
again
for
a
few
moment
with
the
same
portentous
gravity
,
and
nod
his
head
once
,
in
a
slow
and
ghost
-
like
manner
,
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
He
pay
the
coachman
,
and
turn
his
back
on
Bevis
Marks
,
big
with
great
design
for
the
comforting
of
Kit
's
mother
and
the
aid
of
kit
himself

<EOS>
but
the
life
of
gentleman
devote
to
such
pleasure

Richard
Swiveller

be
extremely
precarious

the
spiritual
excitement
of
the
last
fortnight

work
upon
a
system
affect
in
no
slight
degree
by
the
spirituous
excitement
of
some
year

prove
a
little
too
much
for
him

<EOS>
that
very
night

Mr

be
seize

alarming
illness

toss
to
and
fro
upon
his
hot
,
uneasy
bed
;
torment
by
a
fierce
thirst
which
nothing
could
appease
;
unable
to
find
,
in
any
change
of
posture
,
a
moment
's
peace
or
ease

and
rambling
,
ever
,
through
desert
of

where
there
be
no
rest
-
place
,
no
sight

sound
suggestive
of
refreshment

repose
,
nothing
but
a
dull
eternal
weariness

with
no
change

the
restless
shifting
of
his
miserable

the

constant

in

always
shadowy

dim
,

recognisable
for
the

phantom
in

shape
it
take
:
darken
every
vision
like
an
evil
conscience
,
and
make
slumber
horrible
---
in
these
slow
torture
of
his
dread
disease
,
the
unfortunate
Richard
lie
waste
and
consume
inch
by
inch
,
until
,
at
last
,
when
he
seem
to
fight
and
struggle
to
rise
up
,
and
to
be
hold
down
by
devil
,
he
sink
into
a
deep
sleep
,
and
dream
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
awake
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
sensation
of
most
blissful
rest
,
well
than
sleep
itself
,
he
begin
gradually
to
remember
something
of
these
suffering
,
and
to
think
what
a
long
night
it
have
be
,
and
whether
he
have
not
be
delirious
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
Happening
,
in
the
midst
of
these
cogitation
,
to
raise
his
hand
,
he
be
astonish
to
find
how
heavy
it
seem
,
and
yet
how
thin
and
light
it
really
be
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
feel
indifferent
and
happy
;
and
have
no
curiosity
to
pursue
the
subject
,
remain
in
the
same
waking
slumber
until
his
attention
be
attract
by
a
cough
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
doubt
whether
he
have
lock
his
door
last
night
,
and
feel
a
little
surprised
at
have
a
companion
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
lack
energy
to
follow
up
this
train
of
thought
;
and
unconsciously
fall
,
in
a
luxury
of
repose
,
to
stare
at
some
green
stripe
on
the
bed
-
furniture
,
and
associate
them
strangely
with
patch
of
fresh
turf
,
while
the
yellow
ground
between
make
gravel
-
walk
,
and
so
help
out
a
long
perspective
of
trim
garden
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
ramble
in
imagination
on
these
terrace
,
and
have
quite
lose
himself
among
them
indeed
,
when
he
hear
the
cough
once
more
.
<EOS>
the
walk
shrink
into
stripe
again
at
the
sound
,
and
raise
himself
a
little
in
the
bed
,
and
hold
the
curtain
open
with
one
hand
,
he
look
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
room
certainly
,
and
still
by
candlelight
;
<EOS>
but
with
what
unbounded
astonishment
do
he
see
all
those
bottle
,
and
basin
,
and
article
of
linen
airing
by
the
fire
,
and
such
-
like
furniture
of
a
sick
chamber
---
all
very
clean
and
neat
,
but
all
quite
different
from
anything
he
have
leave
there
,
when
he
go
to
bed
!
<EOS>
the
atmosphere
,
too
,
fill
with
a
cool
smell
of
herb
and
vinegar
;
the
floor
newly
sprinkle
;
the
---
the
what
?
 
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
?
  
<EOS>
yes
;
play
cribbage
with
herself
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
there
she
sit
,
intent
upon
her
game
,
cough
now
and
then
in
a
subdued
manner
as
if
she
fear
to
disturb
him
---
shuffle
the
card
,
cut
,
deal
,
playing
,
counting
,
pegging
---
<EOS>
go
through
all
the
mystery
of
cribbage
as
if
she
have
be
in
full
practice
from
her
cradle
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
contemplate
these
thing
for
a
short
time
,
and
suffer
the
curtain
to
fall
into
its
former
position
,
lay
his
head
on
the
pillow
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
dream

think
Richard

that
be
clear
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
bed
,
my
hand
be
not
make
of
egg
-
shell
;
and
now
I
can
almost
see
through
'em
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
not
a
dream
,
I
have
wake
up
,
by
mistake
,
in
an
Arabian
Night
,
instead
of
a
London
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
doubt
I
be
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
not
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
small
servant
have
another
cough
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
remarkable
!
"
think
Mr
Swiveller
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
dreamt
such
a
real
cough
as
that
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
indeed
,
that
I
ever
dreamt
either
a
cough
or
a
sneeze
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
part
of
the
philosophy
of
dream
that
one
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
---
and
another
---
I
say
!
<EOS>
---
I
be
dream
rather
fast
!
"
  
<EOS>
for
the
purpose
of
test
his
real
condition
,
Mr
Swiveller
,
after
some
reflection
,
pinch
himself
in
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Queerer
still
!
"
<EOS>
he
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
bed
rather
plump
than
otherwise
,
and
now
there
be
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
another
survey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
this
additional
inspection
be
,
to
convince
Mr
Swiveller
that
the
object
by
which
he
be
surround
be
real
,
and
that
he
see
them
,
beyond
all
question
,
with
his
wake
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
arabian
Night
;
that
be
what
it
be
,
"
say
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
Damascus
or
Grand
Cairo
.
 
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
be
a
Genie
,
and
have
have
a
wager
with
another
Genie
about
who
be
the
handsome
young
man
alive
,
and
the
worthy
to
be
the
husband
of
the
Princess
of
China
,
have
bring
me
away
,
room
and
all
,
to
compare
us
together
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
"
say
Mr
Swiveller
,
turn
languidly
round
on
his
pillow
,
and
look
on
that
side
of
his
bed
which
be
next
the
wall
,
"
the
Princess
may
be
still
---
<EOS>
no
,
she
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
not
feel
quite
satisfied
with
this
explanation
,
as
,
even
take
it
to
be
the
correct
one
,
it
still
involve
a
little
mystery
and
doubt
,
Mr
Swiveller
raise
the
curtain
again
,
determine
to
take
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
address
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
an
occasion
present
itself
.
 
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
deal
,
turn
up
a
knave
,
and
omit
to
take
the
usual
advantage
;
upon
which
Mr
Swiveller
call
out
as
loud
as
he
could
---
"
two
for
his
heel
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
jump
up
quickly
and
clap
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arabian
Night
,
certainly
,
"
think
Mr
Swiveller
;
"
they
always
clap
their
hand
instead
of
ring
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
now
for
the
two
thousand
black
slave
,
with
jar
of
jewel
on
their
head
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
appear
,
however
,
that
she
have
only
clap
her
hand
for
joy
;
for
directly
afterward
she
begin
to
laugh
,
and
then
to
cry
;
declare
,
not
in
choice
<EOS>
arabic
but
<EOS>
in
familiar
English
,
that
she
be
"
so
glad
,
she
do
not
know

to
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
Marchioness
,
"
say
Mr
Swiveller
,
thoughtfully
,
"
be
pleased
to
draw
nearer

<EOS>
first
of
all
,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
inform

where
I
shall
find
my

secondly

"
  
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
only
shake
her
head
mournfully
,
and
cry
again
;
whereupon
Mr
Swiveller
(
be
very
weak

feel
his
own
eye
affect
likewise

<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
infer

from
your
manner

these

Richard
after
a
pause
,
and
smile
with

tremble
lip

<EOS>
Mr

be
silent
for
a
long
while

<EOS>
by
and
bye
<EOS>
,
he
begin
to
talk
again

inquire
how
long
he
have
be
there

"
three

return
the
Marchioness
emphatically
;

"
  
<EOS>
the
bare
thought
of
have
be
in
such
extremity
,
cause
Richard
to
fall
into
another
silence
,
and
to
lie
flat
down
again
,
at
his
full
length
.
 
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
,
have
arrange
the
bed
-
clothe
more
comfortably
,
and
feel
that
his
hand
and
forehead
be
quite
cool
---
a
discovery
that
fill
her
with
delight
---
cry
a
little
more
,
and
then
apply
herself
to
get
tea
ready
,
and
make
some
thin
dry
toast
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
thus
engage
,
Mr
Swiveller
look
on
with
a
grateful
heart
,
very
much
astonished
to
see
how
thoroughly
at
home
she
make
herself
,
and
attribute
this
attention
,
in
its
origin
,
to
Sally
Brass
,
whom
,
in
his
own
mind
,
he
could
not
thank
enough
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Marchioness
have
finish
her
toasting
,
she
spread
a
clean
cloth
on
a
tray
,
and
bring
him
some
crisp
slice
and
a
great
basin
of
weak
tea

with
which
(
she
say
)
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
leave
word

may
refresh
himself
when

awake

She
prop
him
up
with
pillow

if
not
as
skilfully
as
if
she
have
be
a
professional
nurse
all
her
life
,
at
least
as
tenderly
;
and
look
on
with
unutterable
satisfaction
while
the
patient
---
stop
every
now
and
then
to
shake
her
by
the
hand
---
take
his
poor
meal
with
an
appetite

relish
,
which
the
great
dainty
of

unable

out
as
passionately
as
if
they
have
be

most
solemn

tremendous
nature

his
companion
speak
thus
:
  
"
well

<EOS>
before
I
run
away

I
use
to
sleep
in
the
kitchen

where
we
play
card
,
you
know

<EOS>
Miss
Sally
use
to
keep
the
key
of
the
kitchen
door
in
her
pocket
,
and
she
always
come
down
at
night
to
take
away
the
candle
and
rake
out
the
fire

<EOS>
when
she
have
do
that
,
she
leave
me
to
go
to

in

dark
,
lock
the
door

the

put
the

up

she

down
in
the
morning

very
early
I
can
tell

let
me
out

<EOS>
I
be
terrible
afraid
of
be
keep
like
this

because
if
there
be
a
fire
,
I
think
they
may
forget
me
and
only
take
care
of
themselves
you
know

<EOS>
so
,
whenever
I
see
an
old
rusty
key
anywhere
,
I
pick
it
up
and
try
if
it
would
fit
the
door
,
and
at
last
I
find
in
the
dust
cellar
a
key
that
do
fit
it

<EOS>
here
,
Mr

a
violent
demonstration
with
his
leg

<EOS>
but
the
small
servant
immediately
pause
in
her
talk
,
he
subside
again
,
and
plead
a
momentary
forgetfulness
of
their
compact
,
entreat
her
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
keep
me
very
short
,
"

the
small
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
you
can
not
think
how
short
they
keep
me
!
 
<EOS>
so
I
use
to
come
out
at
night
after
they
would
go
to
bed
,
and
feel
about
in
the
dark
for
bit
of
biscuit
,
or
sangwitche
that
you
would
leave
in
the
office
,
or
even
piece
of
orange
peel
to
put
into
cold
water
and
make
believe
it
be
wine
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
taste
orange
peel
and
water
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
reply
that
he
have
never
taste
that
ardent
liquor
;
and
once
more
urge
his
friend
to
resume
the
thread
of
her
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
make
believe
very
much
,
it
be
quite
nice
,

say
the
small
servant

but
if
you
do
not

you
know

it
seem
as
if
it
would
bear
a
little
more
seasoning

certainly
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sometimes
I
use
to
come
out
after
they
would
go
to
bed
,
and
sometimes
before

you
know

and
one
or
two
night
before

be
all
that
precious
noise
in
the
office

up

the
small

have
gradually
work
herself
into
as
much
agitation

Mr

therefore
make
no
effort
to
restrain
him
when
he
sit
up
in

and
hastily
demand
whether
this
story
have
be
tell
to
anybody

"
how

reply
his
nurse

I
be
almost
afraid
to

about
it

hope
the
young

let
off

when
I
hear
'em

find
him
guilty

ever

Marchioness

say
Mr

pluck
off
his
nightcap

fling
it
to
the

end
of
the
room
;
"
if
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
retire

<EOS>
It
naturally
occur
to
him
on
very
little
reflection
,
that
the
first
step
to
take
would
be
to
communicate
with
one
of
the
Mr
Garlands
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
that
Mr
Abel
have
not
yet
leave
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
in
as
little
time
as
it
take
to
tell
it
,
the
small
servant
have
the
address
in
pencil
on
a
piece
of
paper
;
a
verbal
description
of
father
and
son
,
which
would
enable
her
to
recognise
either
,
without
difficulty
;
and
a
special
caution
to
be
shy
of
Mr
Chuckster
,
in
consequence
of
that
gentleman
's
know
antipathy
to
Kit

she

bodily

to

<EOS>
"
I

say
Dick
,
as
she
close
the
door
slowly
,

peep
into
the
room
again
,
to
make
sure
that

comfortable

no

nothing

"
It

say
Mr

,
"
in
case
of
fire

something

It
be
well
for
the
small
servant
that
she
be
of
a
sharp
,
quick
nature
,
or
the
consequence
of
send
her
out
alone
,
from
the
very
neighbourhood
in
which
it
be
most
dangerous
for
her
to
appear
,
would
probably
have
be
the
restoration
of
Miss
Sally
Brass
to
the
supreme
authority
over
her
person
.
 
<EOS>
not
unmindful
of
the
risk
she
run
,
however
,
the
Marchioness
no
sooner
leave
the
house
than
she
dive
into
the
first
dark
by
-
way
that
present
itself
,
and
,
without
any
present
reference
to
the
point
to
which
her
journey
tend
,
make
it
her
first
business
to
put
two
good
mile
of
brick
and
mortar
between
herself
and
Bevis
Marks
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
have
accomplish
this
object
,
she
begin
to
shape
her
course
for
the
notary
's
office
,
to
which
---
shrewdly
inquire
of
apple
-
woman
and
oyster
-
seller
at
street
-
corner
,
rather
than
in
lighted
shop
or
of
well
-
dress
people
,
at
the
hazard
of
attract
notice
---
she
easily
procure
a
direction
.
 
<EOS>
as
carrier
-
pigeon
,
on
be
first
let
loose
in
a
strange
place
,
beat
the
air
at
random
for
a
short
time
before
dart
off
towards
the
spot
for
which
they
be
design
,
so
do
the
Marchioness
flutter
round
and
round
until
she
believe
herself
in
safety
,
and
then
bear
swiftly
down
upon
the
port
for
which
she
be
bind
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
bonnet
---
nothing
on
her
head
but
a
great
cap
which
,
in
some
old
time
,
have
be
wear
by
Sally
Brass
,
whose
taste
in
head
-
dress
be
,
as
we
have
see
,
peculiar
---
and
her
speed
be
rather
retard
than
assist
by
her
shoe
,
which
,
be
extremely
large
and
slipshod
,
fly
off
every
now
and
then
,
and
be
difficult
to
find
again
,
among
the
crowd
of
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
poor
little
creature
experience
so
much
trouble
and
delay
from
have
to
grope
for
these
article
of
dress
in
mud
and
kennel
,
and
suffer
in
these
research
so
much
jostle
,
push
,
squeezing
and
bandy
from
hand
to
hand
,
that
by
the
time
she
reach
the
street
in
which
the
notary
live
,
she
be
fairly
wear
out
and
exhaust
,
and
could
not
refrain
from
tear
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
have
get
there
at
last
be
a
great
comfort
,
especially
as
there
be
light
still
burn
in
the
office
window
,
and
therefore
some
hope
that
she
be
not
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
Marchioness
dry
her
eye
with
the
back
of
her
hand
,
and
,
steal
softly
up
the
step
,
peep
in
through
the
glass
door

Mr

be

make
such
preparation
towards

off
for
the
night

as

down
his
wristband
and
pull
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
settle
his
neck
more
gracefully
in
his
stock
,
and
secretly
arrange
his
whisker
by
the
aid
of
a
little
triangular
bit
of
look
glass
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
ashe
of
the
fire
stand
two
gentleman

one
of
whom
she
rightly
judge
to
be
the
notary

and
the
other
(
who
be

his

be
evidently
about

Mr

have
make
these
observation

the
small

counsel
with
herself

resolve
to
wait
in

Mr

out

would
be

with
this
purpose
she
slip
out
again

cross
the

sit
down
upon

step
just
opposite

She
have
hardly

there
come
dance
up

this
pony
have
a
little
phaeton
behind
him

a
man
in
it
;
but
neither
man
nor
phaeton
seem
to
embarrass
him
in
the
least
,
as
he
rear
up
on
his
hind
leg

stop
,
or
go
on
,
or
stand
still
again
,
or
back
,
or
go
side
-
way
,
without
the
small
reference
to
them

just
as
the
fancy
seize
him
,
and
as

he
be
the
free
animal
in
creation

when

pause
;

,
as
if
it
occur
to
him
that
to
stop
when
he
be
require
may
be
to
establish
an
inconvenient
and
dangerous
precedent
,
he
immediately
start
off
again
,
rattle
at
a
fast
trot
to
the
street
corner
,
wheel
round
,
come
back
,

then
stop
of
his

accord

"

this
be
the

quite
of

the
pony
yield
to
Mr

all
this

Mr

clamber
by
a
vigorous
effort
into
the

Mr

little
dreaming

He

some
new
caprice

burst
into
a
great
pace

neither
slacken
it

nor
indulge
in
any
eccentric
performance

arrive
at

Mr

His
regard

on
awake
in
the
morning

Richard

by
slow
degree

of
whisper
voice

Mr

Mr

gentleman

gather
round
the
Marchioness

and
talk
to
her
with
great
earnestness

in
very
subdued
tone

fear

no

to
disturb

He

Old
Mr

inquire
how
he
feel

Dick
be
about
to
answer
that
he
feel
much
well

though
still
as
weak
as
need

,
when
his
little
nurse
,
push
the
visitor
aside
and
press
up
to
his
pillow
as
if
in
jealousy
of
their
interference
,
set
his
breakfast
before
him
,

insist
on
his
take

before

Mr

double

similar
delicacy

feel
even
the
weak
tea

dry
toast
such
irresistible
temptation

consent

eat

drink
on
one
condition

answer

late

no

your

It

not

comfort
by
this
intelligence
,
the
patient
apply
himself
to
his
food
with
a
keen
appetite

though
evidently
not
with
a
great
zest
in
the
eating
than
his
nurse
appear
to
have
in
see
him
eat
.
<EOS>
the
manner
of
this
meal
be
this
:
---
Mr
Swiveller
,
hold
the
slice
of
toast
or
cup
of
tea
in
his
left
hand
,
and
take
a
bite
or
drink
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
constantly
keep
,
in
his
right
,
one
palm
of
the
Marchioness
tight
lock
;
and
to
shake
,
or
even
to
kiss
this
imprisoned
hand
,
he
would
stop
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
the
very
act
of
swallow
,
with
perfect
seriousness
of
intention
,
and
the
utmost
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
he
put
anything
into
his
mouth
,
whether
for
eat
or
drink
,
the
face
of
the
Marchioness
light
up
beyond
all
description
;
but
whenever
he
give
her
one
or
other
of
these
token
of
recognition
,
her
countenance
become
overshadowed
,
and
she
begin
to
sob
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
whether
she
be
in
her
laugh
joy
,
or
in
her
cry
one
,
the
Marchioness
could
not
help
turn
to
the
visitor
with
an
appealing
look
,
which
seem
to
say
,
"
You
see
this
fellow
---
can
I
help
this
?
"
<EOS>
---
and
they
,
be
thus
make
,
as
it
be
,
party
to
the
scene
,
as
regularly
answer
by
another
look
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
certainly
not

<EOS>
this
dumb
-
show
,
take
place
during
the
whole
time
of
the
invalid
's
breakfast
,
and
the
invalid
himself
,
pale
and
emaciated
,
perform
no
small
part
in
the
same
,
it
may
be
fairly
question
whether
at
any
meal
,
where
no
word
,
good
or
bad
,
be
speak
from
begin
to
end
,
so
much
be
express
by
gesture
in
themselves
so
slight
and
unimportant
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
---
and
to
say
the
truth
before
very
long
---
Mr
Swiveller
have
despatch
as
much
toast
and
tea
as
in
that
stage
of
his
recovery
it
be
discreet
to
let
him
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
care
of
the
Marchioness
do
not
stop
here
;
for
,
disappear
for
an
instant
and
presently
return
with
a
basin
of
fair
water
,
she
lave
his
face
and
hand
,
brush
his
hair
,
and
in
short
make
him
as
spruce
and
smart
as
anybody
under
such
circumstance
could
be
make
;
and
all
this
,
in
as
brisk
and
business
<EOS>
-
like
a
manner
,
as
if
he
be
a
very
little
boy
,
and
she
his
grow
-
up
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
various
attention
,
Mr
Swiveller
submit
in
a
kind
of
grateful
astonishment
beyond
the
reach
of
language
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
at
last
bring
to
an
end
,
and
the
Marchioness
have
withdraw
into
a
distant
corner
to
take
her
own
poor
breakfast
<EOS>
(
cold
enough
by
that
time
)
,
he
turn
his
face
away
for
some
few
moment
,
and
shake
hand
heartily
with
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
Dick
,
rouse
himself
from
this
pause

turn
round
again

you
will
do
me
the
favour

I
would

the
question

will
have
another

thank
you

then

you
see

good
fellow

the
single
gentleman

that
while
we
have
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
truth
of
this
disclosure

which
have
so
providentially
come
to
light

"
mean
her
?
"
<EOS>
say
Dick

point
towards
the
Marchioness

her

of
course

<EOS>
while
we
have
no
doubt
of
that
,
or
that
a
proper
use
of
it
would
procure
the
poor
lad
's
immediate
pardon
and
liberation
,
we
have
a
great
doubt
whether
it
would
,
by
itself
,
enable
us
to
reach
Quilp
,
the
chief
agent
in
this
villany
.
<EOS>
I
should
tell
you
that
this
doubt
have
be
confirm
into
something
very
nearly
approach
certainty
by
the
good
opinion
we
have
be
enable
,
in
this
short
space
of
time
,
to
take
upon
the
subject

You
will
agree
with
us
,
that
to
give
him
even
the
most
distant
chance
of
escape
,
if
we
could
help
it
,
would
be
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
with
us
,
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
if
somebody
must
escape

let
it
be
any
one

he

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
return
Dick
,
"
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
if
somebody
must

<EOS>

upon
my
word
,
I
be
unwilling
that
Anybody

for

vice

forth
you

you

light
?

<EOS>
the
single
gentleman
smile
as
if
the
light
in
which
Mr
Swiveller
have
put
the
question
be
not
the
clear
in
the
world
,
and
proceed
to
explain
that
they
contemplate
proceeding
by
stratagem
in
the
first
instance
;
and
that
their
design
be
to
endeavour
to
extort
a
confession
from
the
gentle
Sarah

"
when
she
find
how
much
we

how
we
know
it

that
she

clearly
compromised
already

we
be
not

strong
hope

enable
through
her

punish
the
other
two
effectually

,
she
may
go
scot

free
for
aught
I
care

"
  
<EOS>
Dick
receive
this
project
in
anything
but
a
gracious
manner
,
represent
with
as
much
warmth
as
he
be
then
capable
of
show
,
that
they
would
find
the
old
buck
(
mean
Sarah
)
more
difficult
to
manage
than
Quilp
himself
---
that
,
for
any
tamper
,
terrifying
,
or
cajolery
,
she
be
a
very
unpromising
and
unyielding
subject
---
that
she
be
of
a
kind
of
brass
not
easily
melt
or
mould
into
shape
---
in
short
,
that
they
be
no
match
for
her
,
and
would
be
signally
defeat
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
vain
to
urge
them
to
adopt
some
other
course
.
 
<EOS>
the
single
gentleman
have
be
describe
as
explain
their
joint
intention
,
but
it
should
have
be
write
that
they
all
speak
together
;
that
if
any
one
of
them
by
chance
hold
his
peace
for
a
moment
,
he
stand
gasp
and
pant
for
an
opportunity
to
strike
in
again
:
in
a
word
,
that
they
have
reach
that
pitch
of
impatience
and
anxiety
where
man
can
neither
be
persuade
nor
reason
with
;
and
that
it
would
have
be
as
easy
to
turn
the
most
impetuous
wind
that
ever
blow
,
as
to
prevail
on
them
to
reconsider
their
determination

so

his

of
his
innocence

Mr

short
nap
,
by
the

-
down
on
the

place
outside

as
from
the
shoulder
of
a
porter
,
of
some
giant
load

which

to
shake
the

such

arrow

sago

and
other
delicate

that
the
small

it
possible
that
such

stand
rooted
to
the
spot
in

one

with

the
strong
man
who
empty
the

big

in

not

the
nice

so
suddenly
that

come
out
of

in
small
saucepan
,
and
to
peel
orange
for
the
sick
man
and
to
cut
them
up
in
little
piece

to
ply
the
small
servant
with
glass
of
wine
and
choice
bit
of
everything
until
more
substantial
meat
could
be
prepare
for
her
refreshment

<EOS>
the
whole
of
which
appearance
be
so
unexpected
and
bewildering
,
that
Mr
Swiveller
,
when
he
have
take
two
orange
and
a
little
jelly
,
and
have
see
the
strong
man
walk
off
with
the
empty
basket
,
plainly
leave
all
that
abundance
for
his
use
and
benefit
,
be
fain
to
lie
down
and
fall
asleep
again
,
from
sheer
inability
to
entertain
such
wonder
in
his
mind

it
may
be
characterise
by
the
epithet

that
what
she
have
expect

tax
with

in
connection
with
her
small

be
something
very
different

"
come

"
you

You
have
the
honour

venture

say
so

you

in

worthy

you

remind

your
do

your

can
not
injure
your

for
against
him

you

quite
sufficient
evidence

already

it

harsh
expression
in
a
company

still

I
have
my
feeling
like

<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
a
poet

who
remark
that
feeling

the
common
lot
of
all

<EOS>
if
he
could
have
be
a

have
utter
that
sentiment

he

still
have
be
immortal

Mr

up

aside

a
snarl
malignity

Quilp

who
delude
me

I
scorch

treat
me
otherwise

Quilp

He
give
me
the

in

of

rave

I
believe
he
would
let
it
out

if
it

murder

never
think
of
himself
so
long

could
terrify

now

Brass

pick
up
his

again

replace
the
shade
over

actually
crouch
down

in
the
excess

his
servility

what

you

stand
smirk
for

he
have
propound
some
choice
conundrum

then
say
:

to

short
with

it

me

this

out

to

Mr

reveal
the
whole

bear
as
heavily
as
possible
on

make
himself
out

holy
character

subject

to
human
weakness

thus

He

simper
Brass

who

in

deep
debasement

really
seem

have
change
sex

You

You

you
would
have
do

by

I
have
do
it
myself

spare
you
the
trouble

well

<EOS>
the
shame
,
gentleman

"
add
Brass
,
allow
himself
to
be
slightly
overcome
,
"
if
there
be
any
,
be
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
a
female
should
be
spare
it

"
  
<EOS>
with
deference
to
the
well
opinion
of
Mr
Brass
,
and
more
particularly
to
the
authority
of
his
Great
Ancestor
,
it
may
be
doubt
,
with
humility
,
whether
the
elevate
principle
lay
down
by
the
latter
gentleman
,
and
act
upon
by
his
descendant
,
be
always
a
prudent
one
,
or
attend
in
practice
with
the
desire
result
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
beyond
question
,
a
bold
and
presumptuous
doubt
,
inasmuch
as
many
distinguished
character
,
call
man
of
the
world
,
long
-
head
customer
,
know
dog
,
shrewd
fellow
,
capital
hand
at
business
,
and
the
like
,
have
make
,
and
do
daily
make
,
this
axiom
their
polar
star
and
compass
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
the
doubt
may
be
gently
insinuate
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
illustration
it
may
be
observe
,
that
if
Mr
Brass
,
not
be
over
-
suspicious
,
have
,
without
pry
and
listening
,
leave
his
sister
to
manage
the
conference
on
their
joint
behalf
,
or
prying
and
listen
,
have
not
be
in
such
a
mighty
hurry
to
anticipate
her
(
which
he
would
not
have
be
,
but
for
his
distrust
and
jealousy
)
,
he
would
probably
have
find
himself
much
better
off
in
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
it
will
always
happen
that
these
man
of
the
world
,
who
go
through
it
in
armour
,
defend
themselves
from
quite
as
much
good
as
evil
;
to
say
nothing
of
the
inconvenience
and
absurdity
of
mount
guard
with
a
microscope
at
all
time
,
and
of
wear
a
coat
of
mail
on
the
most
innocent
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
gentleman
speak
together
apart
,
for
a
few
moment
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
their
consultation
,
which
be
very
brief
,
the
Notary
point
to
the
write
material
on
the
table
,
and
inform
Mr
Brass
that
if
he
wish
to
make
any
statement
in
writing
,
he
have
the
opportunity
of
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
feel
bind
to
tell
him
that
they
would
require
his
attendance
,
presently
,
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
and
that
in
what
he
do
or
say
,
he
be
guide
entirely
by
his
own
discretion

"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
Brass
,
draw
off
his
glove

crawl
in
spirit
upon
the
ground
before
them

"
I
will
justify
the
tenderness
with
which
I
know
I
shall
be
treat

as
,
without
tenderness

I
should

now

up

Mr

find
himself
so
exceedingly
affect

at
this
point

that
he
could
say

do
nothing
more
until
some
refreshment
arrive
.
<EOS>
have
partaken
of
it

pretty
freely
for

the
lovely
Sarah

now
with
her
arm
fold

now
with
her
hand
clasped
behind
her
,
pace
the
room
with
manly
stride
while
her
brother
be
thus
employ
,
and
sometimes
stop
to
pull
out
her
snuff

box

bite
the
lid

She
continue
to
pace
up
and
down
until
she
be
quite
tired

then
fall
asleep
on
a
chair
near
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
since
suppose
,
with
some
reason
,
that
this
slumber
be
a
sham
or
feint
,
as
she
contrive
to
slip
away
unobserved
in
the
dusk
of
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
be
an
intentional
and
wake
departure
,
or
a
somnambulistic
leave
-
taking
and
walk
in
her
sleep
,
may
remain
a
subject
of
contention
;
but
,
on
one
point
(
and
indeed
the
main
one
)
<EOS>
all
party
be
agree
.
 
<EOS>
in
whatever
state
she
walk
away
,
she
certainly
do
not
walk
back
again

<EOS>
mention
have
be
make
of
the
dusk
of
the
afternoon
,
it
will
be
infer
that
Mr
Brass
's
task
occupy
some
time
in
the
completion
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
finish
until
evening

,
be
do
at

that
worthy

the
three

adjourn
in
a
hackney

coach
to
the
private
office
of

who
,
give
Mr

a
warm
reception
and
detain
him
in
a
secure
place
that
he
may
insure
to
himself
the
pleasure

him
on

the
cheer
assurance
that
a
warrant
could
not
fail
to
be
grant
next
day
for
the
apprehension

Mr

that
a
proper
application

statement
of
all
the
circumstance
to
the
secretary
of
state
(
who
be
fortunately
in
town

would
no
doubt
procure
kit

free
pardon

liberation
without

now

indeed

it

malignant
career
be
draw
to
a
close

that
retribution

which
often
travel
slowly

again

fall
with
a
crash
upon

ember
it

in
pitchy
darkness

the
noise
at

he
feel
his
way
to

step
into

at
that
moment
the
knocking
cease
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
eight
o'clock
;
but
the
dead
of
the
dark
night
would
have
be
as
noon
-
day
in
comparison
with
the
thick
cloud
which
then
rest
upon
the
earth
,
and
shroud
everything
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
He
dart
forward
for
a
few
pace
,
as

into
the
mouth

some
dim
,
yawning
cavern
;
then
,
think
he
have
go
wrong
,
change
the
direction
of
his
step
;
then
stand
still
,
not
know
where
to
turn

<EOS>
"
if

would
knock
again

intently

noise
be
not
renew
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
to
be
hear
in
that
deserted
place

,
at
interval

the
distant
barking

dog

far
away

in

in

on

<EOS>
as
the
word
pass
his
lip
,
he
stagger
and
fall
---
and
next
moment
be
fight
with
the
cold
dark
water
!
  
<EOS>
for
all
its
bubbling
up
and
rush
in
his
ear
,
he
could
hear
the
knocking
at
the
gate
again
---
could
hear
a
shout
that
follow
it
---
could
recognise
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
his
struggling
and
plash
,
he
could
understand
that
they
have
lose
their
way
,
and
have
wander
back
to
the
point
from
which
they
start
;
that
they
be
all
but
look
on
,
while
he
be
drown
;
that
they
be
close
at
hand
,
but
could
not
make
an
effort
to
save
him
;
that
he
himself
have
shut
and
bar
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
answer
the
shout
---
with
a
yell
,
which
seem
to
make
the
hundred
fire
that
dance
before
his
eye
tremble
and
flicker
,
as
if
a
gust
of
wind
have
stir
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
avail
.
 
<EOS>
the
strong
tide
fill
his
throat
,
and
bear
him
on
,
upon
its
rapid
current
.
  
<EOS>
another
mortal
struggle
,
and
he
be
up
again
,
beat
the
water
with
his
hand
,
and
look
out
,
with
wild
and
glaring
eye
that
show
him
some
black
object
he
be
drift
close
upon
.
 
<EOS>
the
hull
of
a
ship
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
touch
its
smooth
and
slippery
surface
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
one
loud
cry
,
now
---
but
the
resistless
water
bear
him
down
before
he
could
give
it
utterance
,
and
,
drive
him
under
it
,
carry
away
a
corpse
.
  
<EOS>
It
toy
and
sport
with
its
ghastly
freight
,
now
bruise
it
against
the
slimy
pile
,
now
hide
it
in
mud
or
long
rank
grass
,
now
drag
it
heavily
over
rough
stone
and
gravel
,
now
feign
to
yield
it
to
its
own
element
,
and
in
the
same
action
lure
it
away
,
until
,
tired
of
the
ugly
plaything
,
it
fling
it
on
a
swamp
---
a
dismal
place
where
pirate
have
swing
in
chain
through
many
a
wintry
night

and
leave
it
there
to
bleach

and
there

lie
alone

be
red
with
flame

and
the
water
that
bear
it
there

be
tinge
with
the
sullen
light
as
it

along

glare
upon

the
hair
,
stir
by
the
damp
breeze
,
play
in
a
kind
of
mockery
of
death
---
such
a
mockery
as
the
dead
man
himself
would
have
delight
in
when
alive
---
about
its
head
,
and
its
dress
flutter
idly
in
the
night
wind

them
be
his
good
old
master
,
who
come
and
take
him
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
that
his
innocence
be
establish
,
and
that
he
be
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
see
the
speaker
,
but
he
turn
towards
the
voice
,
and
in
try
to
answer
,
fall
down
insensible
.
  
<EOS>
They
recover
him
again
,
and
tell
him
he
must
be
compose
,
and
bear
this
like
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
say
he
must
think
of
his
poor
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
he
do
think
of
her
so
much
,
that
the
happy
news
have
overpower
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
crowd
about
him
,
and
tell
him
that
the
truth
have
go
abroad
,
and
that
all
the
town
and
country
ring
with
sympathy
for
his
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
ear
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
His
thought
,
as
yet
,
have
no
wide
range
than
home
.
 
<EOS>
do
she
know
it
?
<EOS>
what
do
she
say
?
<EOS>
who
tell
her
?
 
<EOS>
He
can
speak
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
They
make
him
drink
a
little
wine
,
and
talk
kindly
to
him
for
a
while
,
until
he
be
more
collect
,
and
can
listen
,
and
thank
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
free
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Garland
think
,
if
he
feel
well
,
it
be
time
they
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
cluster
round
him
,
and
shake
hand
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
very
grateful
to
them
for
the
interest
they
have
in
him
,
and
for
the
kind
promise
they
make
;
but
the
power
of
speech
be
go
again
,
and
he
have
much
ado
to
keep
his
foot
,
even
though
lean
on
his
master
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
come
through
the
dismal
passage
,
some
officer
of
the
jail
who
be
in
wait
there
,
congratulate
him
,
in
their
rough
way
,
on
his
release
.
 
<EOS>
the
newsmonger
be
of
the
number
,
but
his
manner
be
not
quite
hearty
---
there
be
something
of
surliness
in
his
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
upon
kit
as
an
intruder
,
as
one
who
have
obtain
admission
to
that
place
on
false
pretence
,
who
have
enjoy
a
privilege
without
be
duly
qualified
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
very
good
sort
of
young
man
,
he
think
,
but
he
have
no
business
there
,
and
the
sooner
he
be
go
,
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
door
shut
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
pass
the
outer
wall
,
and
stand
in
the
open
air
---
in
the
street
he
have
so
often
picture
to
himself
when
hem
in
by
the
gloomy
stone
,
and
which
have
be
in
all
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
wide
and
more
busy
than
it
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
bad
,
and
yet
how
cheerful
and
gay
in
his
eye
!
<EOS>
one
of
the
gentleman
,
in
take
leave
of
him
,
press
some
money
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
count
it
;
but
when
they
have
go
a
few
pace
beyond
the
box
for
poor
Prisoners
,
he
hastily
return
and
drop
it
in
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Garland
have
a
coach
wait
in
a
neighbouring
street
,
and
,
take
kit
inside
with
him
,
bid
the
man
drive
home
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
they
can
only
travel
at
a
foot
pace
,
and
then
with
torch
go
on
before
,
because
of
the
heavy
fog
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
they
get
farth
from
the
river
,
and
leave
the
close
portion
of
the
town
behind
,
they
be
able
to
dispense
with
this
precaution
and
to
proceed
at
a
brisker
rate
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
road
,
hard
galloping
would
be
too
slow
for
kit
;
but
,
when
they
be
draw
near
their
journey
's
end
,
he
beg
they
may
go
more
slowly
,
and
,
when
the
house
appear
in
sight
,
that
they
may
stop
---
only
for
a
minute
or
two
,
to
give
him
time
to
breathe
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
stopping
then
,
for
the
old
gentleman
speak
stoutly
to
him
<EOS>
,
the
horse
mend
their
pace
,
and
they
be
already
at
the
garden
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
next
minute
,
they
be
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
noise
of
tongue
,
and
tread
of
foot
,
inside
.
 
<EOS>
It
open
.
 
<EOS>
kit
rush
in
,
and
find
his
mother
cling
round
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
,
too
,
be
the
ever
faithful
Barbara
's
mother
,
still
hold
the
baby
as
if
she
have
never
put
it
down
since
that
sad
day
when
they
little
hope
to
have
such
joy
as
this
<EOS>
---
there
she
be
,
Heaven
bless
her
,
cry
her
eye
out
,
and
sob
as
never
woman
sob
before
;
and
there
be
little
Barbara
---
<EOS>
poor
little
Barbara
,
so
much
thin
and
so
much
paler
,
and
<EOS>
yet
so
very
pretty
---
tremble
like
a
leaf
and
support
herself
against
the
wall
;
and
there
be
Mrs
Garland
,
neater
and
nice
than
ever
,
faint
away
stone
dead
with
nobody
to
help
her
;
and
there
be
Mr
Abel
,
violently
blow
his
nose
,
and
want
to
embrace
everybody
;
and
there
be
the
single
gentleman
hovering
round
them
all
,
and
constant
to
nothing
for
an
instant
;
and
there
be
that
good
,
dear
,
thoughtful
little
Jacob
,
sit
all
alone
by
himself
on
the
bottom
stair
,
with
his
hand
on
his
knee
like
an
old
man
,
roar
fearfully
without
give
any
trouble
to
anybody
;
and
each
and
all
of
them
be
for
the
time
clean
out
of
their
wit
,
and
do
jointly
and
severally
commit
all
manner
of
folly
.
  
<EOS>
and
even
when
the
rest
have
in
some
measure
come
to
themselves
again
,
and
can
find
word
and
smile
,
Barbara
---
that
soft
-
hearted
,
gentle
,
foolish
little
Barbara

be
suddenly
miss
,
and
find
to
be
in
a
swoon
by
herself
in
the
back
parlour
,
from
which
swoon
she
fall
into
hysteric
,
and
from
which
hysteric
into
a
swoon
again
,
and
be
,
indeed
,
so
bad
,
that
despite
a
mortal
quantity
of
vinegar
and
cold
water
she
be
hardly
a
bit
better
at
last
than
she
be
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
Kit
's
mother
come
in
and
say
,
will
he
come
and
speak
to
her
;
and
Kit
say
"
yes
,
"
and
go
;
and
he
say
in
a
kind
voice
"
Barbara

"
<EOS>
and
Barbara
's
mother
tell
her
that
"
it
be
only
kit
;
"
and
Barbara
say
(
with
her
eye
close
all
the
time
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
be
it
him
indeed
?
"
<EOS>
and
Barbara
's
mother
say
"
to
be
sure
it
be
,
my
dear
;
there
be
nothing
the
matter
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
in
further
assurance
that
he
be
safe
and
sound
,
kit
speak
to
her
again
;
and
then
Barbara
go
off
into
another
fit
of
laughter
,
and
then
into
another
fit
of
cry
;
and
then
Barbara
's
mother
and
Kit
's
mother
nod
to
each
other
and
pretend
to
scold
her
---
but
only
to
bring
her
to
herself
the
faster
,
bless
you

---
and
be
experienced
matron
,
and
acute
at
perceive
the
first
dawn
symptom
of
recovery
<EOS>
,
they
comfort
Kit
with
the
assurance
that
"
she
will
do
now
,
"
and
so
dismiss
him
to
the
place
from
whence
he
come
.
  
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
in
that
place
(
which
be
the
next
room
)
<EOS>
there
be
decanter
of
wine
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
set
out
as
grand
as
if
kit
and
his
friend
be
first
-
rate
company
;
and
there
be
little
Jacob
,
walk
,
as
the
popular
phrase
be
,
into
a
home
-
make
plum
-
cake
,
at
a
most
surprising
pace
,
and
keep
his
eye
on
the
fig
and
orange
which
be
to
follow
,
and
make
the
good
use
of
his
time
,
you
may
believe
.
 
<EOS>
kit
no
sooner
come
in
,
than
that
single
gentleman
(
never
be
such
a
busy
gentleman
)
<EOS>
charge
all
the
glass
---
bumper
---
and
drink
his
health
,
and
tell
him
he
shall
never
want
a
friend
while
he
live
;
and
so
do
Mr
Garland
,
and
so
do
Mrs
Garland
,
and
so
do
Mr
Abel
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
this
honour
and
distinction
be
not
all
,
for
the
single
gentleman
forthwith
pull
out
of
his
pocket
a
massive
silver
watch
---
go
hard
,
and
right
to
half
a
second
---
and
upon
the
back
of
this
watch
be
engrave
Kit
's
name
,
with
flourish
all
over
;
and
in
short
it
be
kit
's
watch
,
buy
expressly
for
him
,
and
present
to
him
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
rest
<EOS>
assure
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Garland
can
not
help
hint
about
their
present
,
in
store
,
and
that
Mr
Abel
tell
outright
that
he
have
his
;
and
that
kit
be
the
happy
of
the
happy
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
friend
he
have
not
see
yet
,
and
as
he
can
not
be
conveniently
introduce
into
the
family
circle
,
by
reason
of
his
be
an
iron
-
shod
quadrupe
,
kit
take
the
first
opportunity
of
slip
away
and
hurry
to
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
lay
his
hand
upon
the
latch
<EOS>
,
the
pony
neigh
the
loud
pony
's
greeting
;
before
he
have
cross
the
threshold
,
the
pony
be
caper
about
his
loose
box
(
for
he
brook
not
the
indignity
of
a
halter
)
,
mad
to
give
him
welcome
;
and
when
kit
go
up
to
caress
and
pat
him
,
the
pony
rub
his
nose
against
his
coat
,
and
fondle
him
more
lovingly
than
ever
pony
fondle
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
crowning
circumstance
of
his
earnest
,
heartfelt
reception
;
and
Kit
fairly
put
his
arm
round
Whisker
's
neck
and
hug
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
come
Barbara
to
trip
in
there
?
<EOS>
and
how
smart
she
be
again
!
<EOS>
she
have
be
at
her
glass
since
she
recover
.
 
<EOS>
how
come
Barbara
in
the
stable
,
of
all
place
in
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
since
kit
have
be
away
,
the
pony
would
take
his
food
from
nobody
but
her
,
and
Barbara
,
you
see
,
not
dream
that
Christopher
be
there
,
and
just
look
in
,
to
see
that
everything
be
right
,
have
come
upon
him
unawares
.
 
<EOS>
blush
little
Barbara
!
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
kit
have
caress
the
pony
enough
;
it
may
be
that
there
be
even
well
thing
to
caress
than
pony
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
him
for
Barbara
at
any
rate
,
and
hope
she
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
be
a
great
deal
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
---
<EOS>
and
here
Barbara
look
down
and
blush
more
---
that
he
must
have
think
her
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
"
say
Kit
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
be
glad
of
that
,
and
cough
---
Hem
!
---
<EOS>
just
the
slight
cough
possible
---
not
more
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
discreet
pony
when
he
choose
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
quiet
now
as
if
he
be
of
marble
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
knowing
look
,
but
that
he
always
have
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
hardly
have
time
to
shake
hand
,
Barbara
,
"
say
kit
.
<EOS>
Barbara
give
him
her
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
she
be
tremble
now
!
 
<EOS>
foolish
,
flutter
Barbara
!
  
<EOS>
Arm
's
length
?
 
<EOS>
the
length
of
an
arm
be
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
's
be
not
a
long
arm
,
by
any
mean
,
and
besides
,
she
do
not
hold
it
out
straight
,
but
bend
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
kit
be
so
near
her
when
they
shake
hand
,
that
he
could
see
a
small
tiny
tear
,
yet
tremble
on
an
eyelash
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
he
should
look
at
it
,
unknown
to
Barbara
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
Barbara
should
raise
her
eye
unconsciously
,
and
find
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
natural
that
at
that
instant
,
without
any
previous
impulse
or
design
,
kit
should
kiss
Barbara
?
 
<EOS>
He
do
it
,
whether
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
say
"
for
shame
,
"
but
let
him
do
it
too
---
twice
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
do
it
thrice
,
but
the
pony
kick
up
his
heel
and
shake
his
head
,
as
if
he
be
suddenly
take
with
convulsion
of
delight
,
and
Barbara
be
frighten
,
run
away
---
not
straight
to
where
her
mother
and
Kit
's
mother
be
,
though
,
lest
they
should
see
how
red
her
cheek
be
,
and
should
ask
her
why
.
 
<EOS>
Sly
<EOS>
little
Barbara
!
  
<EOS>
when
the
first
transport
of
the
whole
party
have
subside
,
and
Kit
and
his
mother
,
and
Barbara
and
her
mother
,
with
little
Jacob
and
the
baby
to
boot
,
have
have
their
supper
together
---
which
there
be
no
hurrying
over
,
for
they
be
go
to
stop
there
all
night
<EOS>
---
Mr
Garland
call
Kit
to
him
,
and
take
him
into
a
room
where
they
could
be
alone
,
tell
him
that
he
have
something
yet
to
say
,
which
would
surprise
him
greatly
.
 
<EOS>
kit
look
so
anxious
and
turn
so
pale
on
hear
this
,
that
the
old
gentleman
hasten
to
add
,
he
would
be
agreeably
surprised
;
and
ask
him
if
he
would
be
ready
next
morning
for
a
journey

<EOS>
"

in
company
with

<EOS>
"

the
word
"

four
time

shake

while

do
so
,
as
if
he
would
add
that
there

but
Mr

,
instead

as
kit
have
make
sure
he
would
,
tell

very
seriously
,
that

out

She

as
I
learn

she
be
well

I
hear
this
morning

full
of

you
down

shall
hear

"
  
<EOS>
scarcely
venture
to
draw
his
breath
,
Kit
do
as
he
be
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Garland
then
relate
to
him
,
how
he
have
a
brother
(
of
whom
he
would
remember
to
have
hear
him
speak
,
and
whose
picture
,
take
when
he
be
a
young
man
,
hang
in
the
good
room
)
,
and
how
this
brother
live
a
long
way
off
,
in
a
country
-
place
,
with
an
old
clergyman
who
have
be
his
early
friend
.
 
<EOS>
how
,
although
they
love
each
other
as
brother
should
,
they
have
not
meet
for
many
year
,
but
have
communicate
by
letter
from
time
to
time
,
always
look
forward
to
some
period
when
they
would
take
each
other
by
the
hand
once
more
,
and
still
let
the
present
time
steal
on
,
as
it
be
the
habit
for
man
to
do
,
and
suffer
the
Future
to
melt
into
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
how
this
brother
,
whose
temper
be
very
mild
and
quiet
and
retire
---
such
as
Mr
Abel
's
---
be
greatly
beloved
by
the
simple
people
among
whom
he
dwell
,
who
quite
revere
the
Bachelor
(
for
so
they
call
him
)
,
and
have
every
one
experience
his
charity
and
benevolence
.
<EOS>
how
even
those
slight
circumstance
have
come
to
his
knowledge
,
very
slowly
and
in
course
of
year
,
for
the
Bachelor
be
one
of
those
whose
goodness
shun
the
light
,
and
who
have
more
pleasure
in
discover
and
extoll
the
good
deed
of
other
,
than
in
trumpet
their
own
,
be
they
never
so
commendable
.
 
<EOS>
how
,
for
that
reason
,
he
seldom
tell
them
of
his
village
friend
;
but
how
,
for
all
that
,
his
mind
have
become
so
full
of
two
among
them
---
a
child
and
an
old
man
,
to
whom
he
have
be
very
kind
<EOS>
---
that
,
in
a
letter
receive
a
few
day
before
,
he
have
dwell
upon
them
from
first
to
last
,
and
have
tell
such
a
tale
of
their
wandering
,
and
mutual
love
,
that
few
could
read
it
without
be
move
to
tear
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
,
the
recipient
of
that
letter
,
be
directly
lead
to
the
belief
that
these
must
be
the
very
wanderer
for
whom
so
much
search
have
be
make
,
and
whom
Heaven
have
direct
to
his
brother
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
have
write
for
such
further
information
as
would
put
the
fact
beyond
all
doubt
;
how
it
have
that
morning
arrive
;
have
confirm
his
first
impression
into
a
certainty
;
and
be
the
immediate
cause
of
that
journey
be
plan
,
which
they
be
to
take
to

<EOS>
"
in

the

lay
his

on

be
no
sluggard
next
morning
,
but
,
spring
from
his
bed
some
time
before
day
,
begin
to
prepare
for
his
welcome
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
the
hurry
of
spirit
consequent
upon
the
event
of
yesterday
,
and
the
unexpected
intelligence
he
have
hear
at
night
,
have
trouble
his
sleep
through
the
long
dark
hour
,
and
summon
such
uneasy
dream
about
his
pillow
that
it
be
rest
to
rise

but
,
have
it
be
the
beginning
of
some
great
labour
with

in

have
it
be
the
commencement
of

long
journey

perform
on

in

inclement
season
of
the
year

to

pursue
under
very
privation
and
difficulty
,
and
to
be
achieve
only
with
great
distress
,
fatigue
,
and
suffering

have
it
be
the
dawn
of
some
painful
enterprise

certain
to

his
utmost
power
of
resolution

endurance
,
and
to

his

fortitude

only
likely
to

if

Kit
's
cheerful
zeal
would
have
be
as
highly
rouse
:
kit
's
ardour
and
impatience
would
have
be
,
at
least
,
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
he
alone
excited
and
eager
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
have
be
up
a
quarter
of
an
hour
<EOS>
the
whole
house
be
astir
and
busy
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
hurry
to
do
something
towards
facilitate
the
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
the
single
gentleman
,
it
be
true
,
could
do
nothing
himself
,
but
he
overlook
everybody
else
and
be
more
locomotive
than
anybody
.
<EOS>
the
work
of
pack
and
make
ready
go
briskly
on
,
and
by
daybreak
every
preparation
for
the
journey
be
complete
.
 
<EOS>
then
Kit
begin
to
wish
they
have
not
be
quite
so
nimble
;
for
the
travel
-
carriage
which
have
be
hire
for
the
occasion
be
not
to
arrive
until
nine
o'clock
,
and
there
be
nothing
but
breakfast
to
fill
up
the
intervening
blank
of
one
hour
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
yes
there
be
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
Barbara
.
 
<EOS>
Barbara
be
busy
,
to
be
sure
,
but
so
much
the
well
---
kit
could
help
her
,
and
that
would
pass
away
the
time
well
than
any
mean
that
could
be
devise
.
<EOS>
Barbara
have
no
objection
to
this
arrangement
,
and
kit
,
track
out
the
idea
which
have
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
overnight
,
begin
to
think
that
surely
Barbara
be
fond
of
him
,
and
surely
he
be
fond
of
Barbara
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Barbara
,
if
the
truth
must.be
tell
---
as
it
must
and
ought
to
be
---
Barbara
seem
,
of
all
the
little
household
,
to
take
least
pleasure
in
the
bustle
of
the
occasion
;
and
when
Kit
,
in
the
openness
of
his
heart
,
tell
her
how
glad
and
overjoy
it
make
him
,
Barbara
become
more
downcast
still
,
and
seem
to
have
even
less
pleasure
in
it
than
before
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
be
home
<EOS>
so
long
,
Christopher

"
say
Barbara

and
it
be
impossible
to
tell
how
carelessly
she
say
it
---
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
be
home
<EOS>
so
long
,
that
you
need
to

away
again

for
such
a
purpose
,
"
return
kit

<EOS>
"
to
bring
back
Miss

I
be
so
pleased
too
,
to

that
you
will
see
her
,
Barbara
,
at

"
  
<EOS>
Barbara
do
not
absolutely
say
that
she
feel
no
gratification
on
this
point
,
but
she
express
the
sentiment
so
plainly
by
one
little
toss
of
her
head
,
that
kit
be
quite
disconcert
,
and
wonder
,
in
his
simplicity
,
why
she
be
so
cool
about
it

"
You

<EOS>
and
Barbara
pout

not
sulkily

or
in
an
ugly
manner
,
<EOS>

just
enough
to
make
her
look
more
cherry

lipped

there
be
no

I

be
use

talk

almost
as

when

forward
to

I

of
her
smile

be
glad

put
out
her

,
"
It

or
some
such
word
as
those
---
like
what
she
use

I
think
of
see
her
happy
,

with

about
her
,
and
bring
up
as
she
deserve
,
and
as
she
ought
to
be

<EOS>
when
I
think
of
myself
,
it
be
as
her
old
servant
,
and
one
that
love
her
dearly
,
as
his
kind
,
good
,
gentle
mistress
;
and
who
would
have
go
---
yes
,
and
still
would
go
---
through
any
harm
to
serve
her
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
I
could
not
help
be
afraid
that
if
she
come
back
with
friend
about
her
she
may
forget
,
or
be
ashamed
of
have
know
,
a
humble
lad
like
me
,
and
so
may
speak
coldly
,
which
would
have
cut
me
,
Barbara
,
deep
than
I
can
tell
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
to
think
again
,
I
feel
sure
that
I
be
do
her
wrong
in
this
;
and
so
I
go
on
,
as
I
do
at
first
,
hope
to
see
her
once
more
,
just
as
she
use
to
be

hope
this
,
and
remember
what
she
be

have
make
me
feel
as
if
I
would
always
try
to
please
her
,
and
always
be
what
I
should
like
to
seem
to
her
if
I
be
still
her
servant

<EOS>
if
I
be
the
well
for
that
---
and
I
do
not
think
I
be
the
bad
<EOS>
---
I
be
grateful
to
her
for
it
,
and
love
and
honour
her
the
more

that
be
the
plain

Little
Barbara
be
not

nature

be
full
of

melt
into

<EOS>
to

away

the
hard

It
be

go
struggle

forward

vanquish
them
one

;
to
watch
them
drive
up
,
gather
strength

fury
as
they
come
along
;
to
bend
for
a
moment
,
as
they
whistle
past
;
and
then
to
look
back
and
see
them
speed
away
,
their
hoarse
noise
die
in

distance

the
stout

cower
down

sometimes
---
towards
the
end
of
a
long
stage

kit
could
not
help
wish
it
be
a
little
warm
:
but
when
they
stop
to
change
horse
,
and
he
have
have
a
good
run
,
and
what
with
that
,
and
the
bustle
of
pay
the
old
postilion
,
and
rouse
the
new
one
,
and
run
to
and
fro
again
until
the
horse
be
put
to
,
he
be
so
warm
that
the
blood
tingle
and
smart
in
his
finger

end

then
,
he
feel
as
if
to
have
it
one
degree
less
cold
would
be
to
lose
half
the
delight
and
glory
of
the
journey
:
and
up
he
jump
again
,
right
cheerily
,
singe
to
the
merry
music
of
the
wheel
as
they
roll
away
,
and
,
leave
the
townspeople
in
their
warm
bed
,
pursue
their
course
along
the
lonely
road
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
the
two
gentleman
inside

who
be
little
disposed
to
sleep
,
beguile
the
time
with
conversation

of
the
former

many

beyond
that
indefinable
uneasiness

be
inseparable
from
suddenly
awaken
hope

protract
expectation

in
one
of
the
pause

half
the

more
silent

sit

him
old

light

rapidly
increase

wane

the

do
not
stand

the
short
daylight
of

soon
fade
away
,

it
be
dark
again
when
they
have
yet
many
mile
to
travel
.

as
it
grow
dusk
,
the

fall
;
its

moaning
be
more
low

mournful

as

creep
up

covertly
among

bramble

by

the

fall
fast

cover
the

the

noiseless

of

the
life

his

Kit

the
early
glimpse
of
twinkle

their

to
some
not
distant
town

<EOS>
He
could
descry
object
enough
at

none
correctly
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
a
tall
church
spire
appear
in
view
,
which
presently
become
a
tree
,
a
barn
,
a
shadow
on

throw
on
it
by

bright
lamp

there

way
;
which

when
they
be
close
upon
them

turn
to
shadow
too
.
 
<EOS>
a
wall
,
a
ruin
,
a
sturdy
gable
end
,
would
rise
up
in
the
road
;
and
,
when
they
be
plunge
headlong
at
it
,
would
be
the
road
itself
.
 
<EOS>
strange
turning
too
,
bridge
,
and
sheet
of
water
,
appear
to
start
up
here
and
there
,
make
the
way
doubtful

uncertain
;

yet
they
be
on

these

He

posting

inquire
how
far
they
have

go
to
reach
their
journey
's
end

It
be
a
late
hour
in

by

place

be
abed
;

answer
from
an
upper
window
,
ten
mile
.

the
ten
minute
that
ensue
appear
an
hour
;

at
the
end

a
shivering
figure
lead
out
the
horse
they
require
,
and
after
another
brief
delay
they
be
again
in
motion
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
cross
-
country
road

full
,
after

three

four
mile
,
of
hole

cart

rut

which

be
cover

to
keep

footpace

as
it
be
next
to
impossible
for

so
much
agitate
as
they
be
by

time

sit
still

move
so
slowly
,
all
three
get
out
and
plod
on
behind
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
the
distance
seem
interminable
,
and
the
walk
be
most
laborious
.
 
<EOS>
as
each
be
think
within
himself
that
the
driver
must
have
lose
his
way
,
a
church
bell

close
at
hand

strike
the
hour
of
midnight
,
and
the
carriage
stop

It
have

softly
enough

when

cease
to
crunch

the
silence
be

startling

noise

be
replace
by
perfect
stillness

all
continue
dark

silent

before

They
fall
back
a
little
,

look
up
at
the
window
,

<EOS>
They
speak
together
with
a
strange
inconsistency
,
in
whisper
;
unwilling
to
disturb
again
the
dreary
echo
they
have
just
now
raise
.

"
let

go
on

They

kit
interpose
directly
,
and
beg
that
,
while
they
ring
and
wait
at
the
gate
,
they
would
let
him
make
his
way
to
where
this
light
be
shine
,
and
try
to
ascertain
if
any
people
be
about
.
<EOS>
obtain
the
permission
he
desire
,
he
dart
off
with
breathless
eagerness
,
and
,
still
carry
the
birdcage
in
his
hand
,
make
straight
towards
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
hold
that
pace
among
the
grave
,
and
at
another
time
he
may
have
go
more
slowly
,
or
round
by
the
path
.
<EOS>
unmindful
of
all
obstacle
,
however
,
he
press
forward
without
slacken
his
speed
,
and
soon
arrive
within
a
few
yard
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
approach
as
softly
as
he
could
,
and
advance
so
near
the
wall
as
to
brush
the
whitened
ivy
with
his
dress
,
listen
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
sound
inside
.
 
<EOS>
the
church
itself
be
not
more
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
touch
the
glass
with
his
cheek
,
he
listen
again
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
such
a
silence
all
around
,
that
he
feel
sure
he
could
have
hear
even
the
breathing
of
a
sleeper
,
if
there
have
be
one
there
.
  
<EOS>
a
strange
circumstance
,
a
light
in
such
a
place
at
that
time
of
night
,
with
no
one
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
a
curtain
be
draw
across
the
low
portion
of
the
window
,
and
he
could
not
see
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
shadow
throw
upon
it
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
gain
a
footing
on
the
wall
and
try
to
look
in
from
above
,
would
have
be
attend
with
some
danger
---
certainly
with
some
noise
,
and
the
chance
of
terrify
the
child
,
if
that
really
be
her
habitation
.
 
<EOS>
again
and
again
he
listen
;
again
and
again
the
same
wearisome
blank
.
  
<EOS>
leave
the
spot
with
slow
and
cautious
step
,
and
skirt
the
ruin
for
a
few
pace
,
he
come
at
length
to
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
knock
.
 
<EOS>
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
curious
noise
inside
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
determine
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
low
moaning
of
one
in
pain
,
but
it
be
not
that
,
be
far
too
regular
and
constant
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
seem
a
kind
of
song
,
now
a
wail
---
seem
,
that
is
,
to
his
change
fancy
,
for
the
sound
itself
be
never
change
or
check
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
unlike
anything
he
have
ever
hear
;
and
in
its
tone
there
be
something
fearful
,
chilling
,
and
unearthly
.
  
<EOS>
the
listener
's
blood
run
cold
now
than
ever
it
have
do
in
frost
and
snow
,
but
he
knock
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
answer
,
and
the
sound
go
on
without
any
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
softly
upon
the
latch
,
and
put
his
knee
against
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
secure
on
the
inside
,
but
yield
to
the
pressure
,
and
turn
upon
its
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
glimmering
of
a
fire
upon
the
old
wall
,
and
enter
.

that
it

of
her
be
restore
to
them
,
just
as
she
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
beg
hard
to
see
her
,
say
that
he
would
be
very
quiet
,
and
that
they
need
not
fear
his
be
alarm
,
for
he
have
sit
alone
by
his
young
brother
all
day
long
when
he
be
dead
,
and
have
feel
glad
to
be
so
near
him
.
<EOS>
They
let
him
have
his
wish
;
and
indeed
he
keep
his
word
,
and
be
,
in
his
childish
way
,
a
lesson
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
up
to
that
time
,
the
old
man
have
not
speak
once
---
except
to
her
---
or
stir
from
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
see
her
little
favourite
,
he
be
move
as
they
have
not
see
him
yet
,
and
make
as
though
he
would
have
him
come
near
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
point
to
the
bed
,
he
burst
into
tear
for
the
first
time
,
and
they
who
stand
by
,
know
that
the
sight
of
this
child
have
do
him
good
,
leave
them
alone
together
.
  
<EOS>
soothe
him
with
his
artless
talk
of
her
,
the
child
persuade
him
to
take
some
rest
,
to
walk
abroad
,
to
do
almost
as
he
desire
him
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
day
come
on
,
which
must
remove
her
in
her
earthly
shape
from
earthly
eye
for
ever
,
he
lead
him
away
,
that
he
may
not
know
when
she
be
take
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
to
gather
fresh
leave
and
berry
for
her
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Sunday
---
a
bright
,
clear
,
wintry
afternoon
---
<EOS>
and
as
they
traverse
the
village
street
,
those
who
be
walk
in
their
path
draw
back
to
make
way
for
them
,
and
give
them
a
soften
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
some
shake
the
old
man
kindly
by
the
hand
,
some
stand
uncovered
while
he
totter
by
,
and
many
cry
"
God
help
him
!
"
<EOS>
as
he
pass
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
Neighbour

the
old

,
stop
at
the
cottage
where
his

"
how

it
that
the
folk

<EOS>
I
have

a
mourning
ribbon
or
a
piece
of
crape
on
almost
every

<EOS>
She
could
not

the

<EOS>
"

again
the

"
We

hurriedly

"
We

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

cry
the
child
,

him
.
 
<EOS>
"
remember
what

<EOS>
Our
way
be
to
the
old
green
lane
,
where
she
and
I
so
often

and
where

He
press
his
hand
upon
his
brow
,
look
vacantly
round
,
and
as
if
impel
by
a
sudden
thought
,
cross
the
road
,
and
enter
the
sexton

house

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
the

a
hasty

to
them
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
action
of
an
instant

and
the
old

enough

and
so

and
now
the
bell

the
bell
she

so
often

by
night
and
day

and
listen
to
with
solemn
pleasure
almost
as

Decrepit

on
crutch

in
the
pride
of
strength
and
health
,
in
the
full
blush
of
promise
,
in
the
mere
dawn
of
life

to
gather
round
her
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
old
man
be
there
,
whose
eye
be
dim
and
sense
fail
---
<EOS>
grandmother
,
who
may
have
die
ten
year
ago
,
and
still
be
old
---
the
deaf
,
the
blind
,
the
lame
,
the
palsy
,
the
living
dead
in
many
shape
and
form
,
to
see
the
closing
of
that
early
grave
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
death
it
would
shut
in
,
to
that
which
still
could
crawl
and
creep
above
it
!
  
<EOS>
along
the
crowded
path
they
bear
her
now
;
pure
as
the
newly
-
fall
snow
that
cover
it
;
whose
day
on
earth
have
be
as
fleeting
.
<EOS>
under
the
porch
,
where
she
have
sit
when
Heaven
in
its
mercy
bring
her
to
that
peaceful
spot
,
she
pass
again
;
and
the
old
church
receive
her
in
its
quiet
shade
.
  
<EOS>
They
carry
her
to
one
old
nook
,
where
she
have
many
and
many
a
time
sit
muse
,
and
lay
their
burden
softly
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
stream
on
it
through
the
coloured
window
---
a
window
,
where
the
bough
of
tree
be
ever
rustle
in
the
summer
,
and
where
the
bird
sing
sweetly
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
with
every
breath
of
air
that
stir
among
those
branch
in
the
sunshine
,
some
tremble
,
change
light
,
would
fall
upon
her
grave
.
  
<EOS>
earth
to
earth
,
ash
to
ashe
,
dust
to
dust
!
 
<EOS>
many
a
young
hand
drop
in
its
little
wreath
,
many
a
stifled
sob
be
hear
.
 
<EOS>
some
---
<EOS>
and
they
be
not
a
few
---
knelt
down
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
sincere
and
truthful
in
their
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
the
service
do
,
the
mourner
stand
apart
,
and
the
villager
close
round
to
look
into
the
grave
before
the
pavement
-
stone
should
be
replace
.
 
<EOS>
one
call
to
mind
how
he
have
see
her
sit
on
that
very
spot
,
and
how
her
book
have
fall
on
her
lap
,
and
she
be
gaze
with
a
pensive
face
upon
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
another
tell
,
how
he
have
wonder
much
that
one
so
delicate
as
she
,
should
be
so
bold
;
how
she
have
never
fear
to
enter
the
church
alone
at
night
,
but
have
love
to
linger
there
when
all
be
quiet
,
and
even
to
climb
the
tower
stair
,
with
no
more
light
than
that
of
the
moon
ray
steal
through
the
loophole
in
the
thick
old
wall
.
 
<EOS>
a
whisper
go
about
among
the
old
,
that
she
have
see
and
talk
with
angel
;
and
when
they
call
to
mind
how
she
have
look
,
and
speak
,
and
her
early
death
,
some
think
it
may
be
so
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
come
to
the
grave
in
little
knot
,
and
glance
down
,
and
give
place
to
other
,
and
fall
off
in
whisper
group
of
three
or
four
,
the
church
be
clear
in
time
,
of
all
but
the
sexton
and
the
mourning
friend
.
  
<EOS>
They
see
the
vault
cover
,
and
the
stone
fix
down
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
dusk
of
evening
have
come
on
,
and
not
a
sound
disturb
the
sacred
stillness
of
the
place
---
when
the
bright
moon
pour
in
her
light
on
tomb
and
monument
,
on
pillar
,
wall
,
and
arch
,
and
most
of
all
(
it
seem
to
them
)
upon
her
quiet
grave
---
in
that
calm
time
,
when
outward
thing
and
inward
thought
teem
with
assurance
of
immortality
,
and
worldly
hope
and
fear
be
humble
in
the
dust
before
them
---
then
,
with
tranquil
and
submissive
heart
they
turn
away
,
and
leave
the
child
with
God
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
hard
to
take
to
heart
the
lesson
that
such
death
will
teach
,
but
let
no
man
reject
it
,
for
it
be
one
that
all
must
learn
,
and
be
a
mighty
,
universal
Truth
.
 
<EOS>
when
death
strike
down
the
innocent
and
young
,
for
every
fragile
form
from
which
he
let
the
pant
spirit
free
,
a
hundred
virtue
rise
,
in
shape
of
mercy
,
charity
,
and
love
,
to
walk
the
world
,
and
bless
it
.
 
<EOS>
of
every
tear
that
sorrow
mortal
shed
on
such
green
grave
,
some
good
be
bear
,
some
gentler
nature
come
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Destroyer
's
step
there
spring
up
bright
creation
that
defy
his
power
,
and
his
dark
path
become
a
way
of
light
to
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
late
when
the
old
man
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
have
lead
him
to
his
own
dwelling
,
under
some
pretence
,
on
their
way
back
;
and
,
render
drowsy
by
his
long
ramble
and
late
want
of
rest
,
he
have
sink
into
a
deep
sleep
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
exhaust
,
and
they
be
careful
not
to
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
slumber
hold
him
a
long
time
,
and
when
he
at
length
awake
the
moon
be
shine
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
brother
,
uneasy
at
his
protract
absence
,
be
watch
at
the
door
for
his
coming
,
when
he
appear
in
the
pathway
with
his
little
guide
.
 
<EOS>
He
advance
to
meet
them
,
and
tenderly
oblige
the
old
man
to
lean
upon
his
arm
,
conduct
him
with
slow
and
tremble
step
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
repair
to
her
chamber
,
straight
.
 
<EOS>
not
find
what
he
have
leave
there
,
he
return
with
distract
look
to
the
room
in
which
they
be
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
,
he
rush
into
the
schoolmaster
's
cottage
,
call
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
They
follow
close
upon
him
,
and
when
he
have
vainly
search
it
,
bring
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
persuasive
word
as
pity
and
affection
could
suggest
,
they
prevail
upon
him
to
sit
among
them
and
hear
what
they
should
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
endeavour
by
every
little
artifice
to
prepare
his
mind
for
what
must
come
,
and
dwell
with
many
fervent
word
upon
the
happy
lot
to
which
she
have
be
remove
,
they
tell
him
,
at
last
,
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
it
have
pass
their
lip
,
he
fall
down
among
them
like
a
murdered
man
.
  
<EOS>
for
many
hour
,
they
have
little
hope
of
his
surviving
;
but
grief
be
strong
,
and
he
recover
.
  
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
who
have
never
know
the
blank
that
follow
death
---
the
weary
void
---
the
sense
of
desolation
that
will
come
upon
the
strong
mind
,
when
something
familiar
and
beloved
be
miss
at
every
turn
---
the
connection
between
inanimate
and
senseless
thing
,
and
the
object
of
recollection
,
when
every
household
god
become
a
monument
and
every
room
<EOS>
a
grave
---
if
there
be
any
who
have
not
know
this
,
and
prove
it
by
their
own
experience
,
they
can
never
faintly
guess
how
,
for
many
day
,
the
old
man
pine
and
mope
away
the
time
,
and
wander
here
and
there
as
seek
something
,
and
have
no
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
power
of
thought
or
memory
he
retain
,
be
all
bind
up
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
understand
,
or
seem
to
care
to
understand
,
about
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
to
every
endearment
and
attention
he
continue
listless
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
speak
to
him
on
this
,
or
any
other
theme
---
save
one
---
he
would
hear
them
patiently
for
awhile
,
then
turn
away
,
and
go
on
seek
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
one
theme
,
which
be
in
his
and
all
their
mind
,
it
be
impossible
to
touch
.
 
<EOS>
Dead
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
hear
or
bear
the
word
.
<EOS>
the
slight
hint
of
it
would
throw
him
into
a
paroxysm
,
like
that
he
have
have
when
it
be
first
speak
.
 
<EOS>
in
what
hope
he
live
,
no
man
could
tell
;
but
that
he
have
some
hope
of
find
her
again
---
some
faint
and
shadowy
hope
,
defer
from
day
to
day
,
and
make
him
from
day
to
day
more
sick
and
sore
at
heart
---
be
plain
to
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
bethink
them
of
a
removal
from
the
scene
of
this
last
sorrow
;
of
try
whether
change
of
place
would
rouse
or
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
His
brother
seek
the
advice
of
those
who
be
account
skilful
in
such
matter
,
and
they
come
and
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
number
staid
upon
the
spot
,
converse
with
him
when
he
would
converse
,
and
watch
him
as
he
wander
up
and
down
,
alone
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
move
him
where
they
may
<EOS>
,
they
say
,
he
would
ever
seek
to
get
back
there
.
<EOS>
His
mind
would
run
upon
that
spot
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
confine
him
closely
,
and
keep
a
strict
guard
upon
him
,
they
may
hold
him
prisoner
,
but
if
he
could
by
any
mean
escape
,
he
would
surely
wander
back
to
that
place
,
or
die
upon
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
the
boy
,
to
whom
he
have
submit
at
first
,
have
no
longer
any
influence
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
time
he
would
suffer
the
child
to
walk
by
his
side
,
or
would
even
take
such
notice
of
his
presence
as
give
him
his
hand
,
or
would
stop
to
kiss
his
cheek
,
or
pat
him
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
he
would
entreat
him
---
not
unkindly
---
to
be
go
,
and
would
not
brook
him
near
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whether
alone
,
or
with
this
pliant
friend
,
or
with
those
who
would
have
give
him
,
at
any
cost
or
sacrifice
,
some
consolation
or
some
peace
of
mind
,
if
happily
the
mean
could
have
be
devise
;
he
be
at
all
time
the
same
---
with
no
love
or
care
for
anything
in
life
---
a
break
-
hearted
man
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
they
find
,
one
day
,
that
he
have
rise
early
,
and
,
with
his
knapsack
on
his
back
,
his
staff
in
hand
,
her
own
straw
hat
,
and
little
basket
full
of
such
thing
as
she
have
be
use
to
carry
,
be

.
 
<EOS>
as
they
be
make
ready
to
pursue
him
far
and
wide
,
a
frightened
schoolboy
come
who
have
see
him
,
but
a
moment
before
,
sit
in
the
church
---
upon
her
grave
,
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
They
hasten
there
,
and
go
softly
to
the
door
,
espy
him
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
wait
patiently
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
disturb
him
then
,
but
keep
a
watch
upon
him
all
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
grow
quite
dark
,
he
rise
and
return
home
,
and
go
to
bed
,
murmur
to
himself
,
"
She
will
come
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
upon
the
morrow
he
be
there
again
from
sunrise
until
night
;
and
still
at
night
he
lay
him
down
to
rest
,
and
murmur
,
"
She
will
come
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
thenceforth
,
every
day
,
and
all
day
long
,
he
wait
at
her
grave
,
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
picture
of
new
journey
over
pleasant
country
,
of
resting
-
place
under
the
free
broad
sky
,
of
ramble
in
the
field
and
wood

and

not
often

how

of
that

how
many
glimpse
of
the
form
,
the
flutter
dress
,
the

that

so
gaily
in
the

how
many

and
what
he
hope
be
yet
to
be

rise
up
before
him
,
in
the
old
,
dull
,
silent
church
!
 
<EOS>
He
never
tell
them
what
he
think
,
or
where
he
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sit
with
them
at
night
,
ponder
with
a
secret
satisfaction
,
they
could
see
,
upon
the
flight
that
he
and
she
would
take
before
night
come
again
;
and
still
they
would
hear
him
whisper
in
his
prayer
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
let
her
come
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
last
time
be
on
a
genial
day
in
spring
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
return
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
they
go
to
seek
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
lie
dead
upon
the
stone
.
  
<EOS>
They
lay
him
by
the
side
of
her
whom
he
have
love
so
well
;
and
,
in
the
church
where
they
have
often
pray
,
and
muse
,
and
linger
hand
in
hand
,
the
child
and
the
old
man
sleep
together

it

Mr

,
strike
with
the
humour
of
this

,

carry
out
its

to

,

a

of

whose

fall
some

short
of

proffer

as

<EOS>
these

be

after

four

Mr

consent

and
do
remain

until
a

of

call
a
grand
jury
(
who
be
in
the
joke
)
summon
him
to
a
trial
before
twelve
other
wag
for
perjury
and
fraud
,
who
in
their
turn
find
him
guilty
with
a
most
facetious
joy
,
---
nay
,
the
very
populace
enter
into
the
whim
,
and
when
Mr

be
move
in
a
hackney
-
coach
towards
the
building
where
these
wag
assemble
,
salute
him
with
rotten
egg

carcase
of

feign
to
wish
to
tear
him
into

,
which
greatly
increase
the
comicality
of
the
thing

and
make
him

the

no

<EOS>
to
work
this
sportive
vein
still
further
,
Mr
Brass
,
by
his
counsel
,
move
in
arrest
of
judgment
that
he
have
be
lead
to
criminate
himself
,
by
assurance
of
safety
and
promise
of
pardon
,
and
claim
the
leniency
which
the
law
extend
to
such
confiding
nature
as
be
thus
delude
.
 
<EOS>
after
solemn
argument
,
this
point
(
with
other
of
a
technical
nature
,
whose
humorous
extravagance
it
would
be
difficult
to
exaggerate
)
be
refer
to
the

for
their
decision
,
Sampson
be

remove
to
his
former
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
some
of
the
point
be
give
in
Sampson
's
favour
,
and
some
against
him
;
and
the
upshot
be
,
that
,
instead
of
be
desire
to
travel
for
a
time
in
foreign
part
,
he
be
permit
to
grace
the
mother
country
under
certain
insignificant
restriction
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
,
that
he
should
,
for
a
term
of
year
,
reside
in
a
spacious
mansion
where
several
other
gentleman
be
lodge
and
board
at

who
go
clothe
in
a
sober
uniform
of
grey
turn
up
with
yellow

have
their
hair
cut
extremely
short
,
and
chiefly
live
on
gruel
and
light
soup
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
also
require
of
him
that
he
should
partake
of
their
exercise
of
constantly
ascend
an
endless
flight
of
stair
;
and
,
lest
his
leg
,
unused
to
such
exertion
,
should
be
weaken
by
it

that
he
should
wear
upon
one
ankle
an
amulet

charm
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
these
condition
be
arrange
,
he
be
remove
one
evening
to
his
new
abode
,
and
enjoy
,
in
common
with
nine
other

and
two

,
the
privilege

be
take
to
his
place
of
retirement

one
of

<EOS>
over

above
these
trifling
penalty
,
his

be
erase

the

attorney
;
which
erasure
have
be
always
hold
in
these
latter

to
be
a
great

reproach

and
to
imply
the
commission

amazing
villany

<EOS>
as
indeed
it

the
case

when
so

worthless

<EOS>
of
Sally

conflicting
rumour

<EOS>
some
say
with
confidence
that
she
have
go
down
to
the
dock
in
male
attire
,
and
have
become
a
female
sailor
;
other
darkly
whisper
that
she
have
enlist
as
a
private
in
the
second
regiment
of
Foot
Guards
,
and
have
be
see
in
uniform
,
and
on
duty
,
to
wit
,
lean
on
her
musket
and
look
out
of
a
sentry
-
box
in
St
james
's
Park
,
one
evening
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
such
whisper
as
these
in
circulation
;
but
the
truth
appear
to
be
that
,
after
the
lapse
of
some
five
year
(
during
which
there
be
no
direct
evidence
of
her
have
be
see
at
all
)
,
two
wretched
people
be
more
than
once
observe
to
crawl
at
dusk
from
the
inmost
recess
of
St
Giles
's
,
and
to
take
their
way
along
the
street
,
with
shuffling
step
and
cower
shivering
form
,
look
into
the
road
and
kennel
as
they
go
in
search
of
refuse
food
or
disregard
offal
.
 
<EOS>
these
form
be
never
behold
but
in
those
night
of
cold
and
gloom
,
when
the
terrible
spectre
,
who
lie
at
all
other
time
in
the
obscene
hiding
-
place
of
London
,
in
archway
,
dark
vault
and
cellar
,
venture
to
creep
into
the
street
;
the
embody
spirit
of
Disease
,
and
Vice
,
and
Famine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
whisper
by
those
who
should
have
know
,
that
these
be
Sampson
and
his
sister
Sally
;
and
to
this
day
,
it
be
say
,
they
sometimes
pass
,
on
bad
night
,
in
the
same
loathsome
guise
,
close
at
the
elbow
of
the
shrink
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
the
body
of
Quilp
be
find
---
though
not
until
some
day
have
elapse
---
an
inquest
be
hold
on
it
near
the
spot
where
it
have
be
wash
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
the
general
supposition
be
that
he
have
commit
suicide
,
and
,
this
appear
to
be
favour
by
all
the
circumstance
of
his
death
,
the
verdict
be
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
leave
to
be
bury
with
a
stake
through
his
heart
in
the
centre
of
four
lonely
road
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
rumour
afterwards
that
this
horrible
and
barbarous
ceremony
have
be
dispense
with
,
and
that
the
remain
have
be
secretly
give
up
to
Tom
Scott
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
here
,
opinion
be
divide
;
for
some
say
Tom
dig
them
up
at
midnight
,
and
carry
them
to
a
place
indicate
to
him
by
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
both
these
story
may
have
have
their
origin
in
the
simple
fact
of
Tom
's
shed
tear
upon
the
inquest
---
which
he
certainly
do
,
extraordinary
as
it
may
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
manifest
,
besides
,
a
strong
desire
to
assault
the
jury
;
and
be
restrain
and
conduct
out
of
court
,
darken
its
only
window
by
stand
on
his
head
upon
the
sill
,
until
he
be
dexterously
tilt
upon
his
foot
again
by
a
cautious
beadle
.
  
<EOS>
be
cast
upon
the
world
by
his
master
's
death
,
he
determine
to
go
through
it
upon
his
head
and
hand
,
and
accordingly
begin
to
tumble
for
his
bread
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
his
english
birth
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
his
advancement
in
this
pursuit
<EOS>
(
notwithstanding
that
his
art
be
in
high
repute
and
favour
)
,
he
assume
the
name
of
an
italian
image
lad
,
with
whom
he
have
become
acquaint
;
and
afterwards
tumble
with
extraordinary
success
,
and
to
overflow
audience
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Mrs
Quilp
never
quite
forgave
herself
the
one
deceit
that
lie
so
heavy
on
her
conscience
,
and
never
speak
or
think
of
it
<EOS>
but
with
bitter
tear
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
have
no
relation
,
and
she
be
rich
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
make
no
will
,
or
she
would
probably
have
be
poor
.
 
<EOS>
have
marry
the
first
time
at
her
mother
's
instigation
,
she
consult
in
her
second
choice
nobody
but
herself
.
 
<EOS>
It
fall
upon
a
smart
young
fellow
enough
;
and
as
he
make
it
a
preliminary
condition
that
Mrs
Jiniwin
should
be
thenceforth
an
out
-
pensioner
,
they
live
together
after
marriage
with
no
more
than
the
average
amount
of
quarrelling
,
and
lead
a
merry
life
upon
the
dead
dwarf
's
money
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Garland
,
and
Mr
Abel
,
go
out
as
usual
(
except
that
there
be
a
change
in
their
household
,
as
will
be
see
presently
)
,
and
in
due
time
the
latter
go
into
partnership
with
his
friend
the
notary
,
on
which
occasion
there
be
a
dinner
,
and
a
ball
,
and
great
extent
of
dissipation
.
 
<EOS>
unto
this
ball
there
happen
to
be
invite
the
most
bashful
young
lady
that
be
ever
see
,
with
whom
Mr
Abel
happen
to
fall
in
love
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
happen
,
or
how
they
find
it
out
,
or
which
of
them
first
communicate
the
discovery
to
the
other
,
nobody
know
.
 
<EOS>
but
certain
it
be
that
in
course
of
time
they
be
married
;
and
<EOS>
equally
certain
it
be
that
they
be
the
happy
of
the
happy
;
and
no
less
certain
it
be
that
they
deserve
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
pleasant
to
write
down
that
they
rear
a
family
;
because
any
propagation
of
goodness
and
benevolence
be
no
small
addition
to
the
aristocracy
of
nature
,
and
no
small
subject
of
rejoice
for
mankind
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
the
pony
preserve
his
character
for
independence
and
principle
down
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
;
which
be
an
unusually
long
one
,
and
cause
him
to
be
look
upon
,
indeed
,
as
the
very
Old
Parr
of
pony
.
 
<EOS>
He
often
go
to
and
fro
with
the
little
phaeton
between
Mr
Garland
's
and
his
son
's
,
and
,
as
the
old
people
and
the
young
be
frequently
together
,
have
a
stable
of
his
own
at
the
new
establishment
,
into
which
he
would
walk
of
himself
with
surprising
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
condescend
to
play
with
the
child
,
as
they
grow
old
enough
to
cultivate
his
friendship
,
and
would
run
up
and
down
the
little
paddock
with
them
like
a
dog
;
but
though
he
relax
so
far
,
and
allow
them
such
small
freedom
as
caress
,
or
even
to
look
at
his
shoe
or
hang
on
by
his
tail
,
he
never
permit
any
one
among
them
to
mount
his
back
or
drive
him
;
thus
show
that
even
their
familiarity
must
have
its
limit
,
and
that
there
be
point
between
them
far
too
serious
for
trifling
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
unsusceptible
of
warm
attachment
in
his
later
life
,
for
when
the
good
bachelor
come
to
live
with
Mr
Garland
upon
the
clergyman
's
decease
,
he
conceive
a
great
friendship
for
him
,
and
amiably
submit
to
be
drive
by
his
hand
without
the
least
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
no
work
for
two
or
three
year
before
he
die
,
but
live
in
clover
;
and
his
last
act
(
like
a
choleric
old
gentleman
)
be
to
kick
his
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
,
recover
very
slowly
from
his
illness
,
and
enter
into
the
receipt
of
his
annuity
,
buy
for
the
Marchioness
a
handsome
stock
of
clothe
,
and
put
her
to
school
forthwith
,
in
redemption
of
the
vow
he
have
make
upon
his
fevered
bed
.
 
<EOS>
after
cast
about
for
some
time
for
a
name
which
should
be
worthy
of
her
,
he
decide
in
favour
of
Sophronia
Sphynx
,
as
be
euphonious
and
genteel
,
and
furthermore
indicative
of
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
under
this
title
the
Marchioness
repair
,
in
tear
,
to
the
school
of
his
selection
,
from
which
,
as
she
soon
distance
all
competitor
,
she
be
remove
before
the
lapse
of
many
quarter
to
one
of
a
high
grade
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
bare
justice
to
Mr
Swiveller
to
say
,
that
,
although
the
expense
of
her
education
keep
him
in
straitened
circumstance
for
half
a
dozen
year
,
he
never
slacken
in
his
zeal
,
and
always
hold
himself
sufficiently
repay
by
the
account
he
hear
(
with
great
gravity
)
of
her
advancement
,
on
his
monthly
visit
to
the
governess
,
who
look
upon
him
as
a
literary
gentleman
of
eccentric
habit
,
and
of
a
most
prodigious
talent
in
quotation
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
Mr
Swiveller
keep
the
Marchioness
at
this
establishment
until
she
be
,
at
a
moderate
guess
,
full
nineteen
year
of
age
---
good
-
looking
,
clever
,
and
good
-
humoured
;
when
he
begin
to
consider
seriously
what
be
to
be
do
next
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
of
his
periodical
visit
,
while
he
be
revolve
this
question
in
his
mind
,
the
Marchioness
come
down
to
him
,
alone
,
look
more
smile
and
more
fresh
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
it
occur
to
him
,
but
not
for
the
first
time
,
that
if
she
would
marry
him
,
how
comfortable
they
may
be
!
<EOS>
so
Richard
ask
her
;
whatever
she
say
,
it
be
not
no
;
and
they
be
marry
in
good
earnest
that
day
week
.
 
<EOS>
which
give
Mr
Swiveller
frequent
occasion
to
remark
at
diver
subsequent
period
that
there
have
be
a
young
lady
save
up
for
him
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
cottage
at
Hampstead
be
to
let
,
which
have
in
its
garden
a
smoking
-
box
,
the
envy
of
the
civilised
world
,
they
agree
to
become
its
tenant
,
and
,
when
the
honey
-
moon
be
over
,
enter
upon
its
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
retreat
<EOS>
Mr
Chuckster
repair
regularly
every
Sunday
to
spend
the
day
---
usually
begin
with
breakfast
---
and
here
he
be
the
great
purveyor
of
general
news
and
fashionable
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
year
he
continue
a
deadly
foe
to
kit
,
protest
that
he
have
a
well
opinion
of
him
when
he
be
suppose
to
have
steal
the
five
-
pound
note
,
than
when
he
be
show
to
be
perfectly
free
of
the
crime
;
inasmuch
as
his
guilt
would
have
have
in
it
something
daring
and
bold
,
whereas
his
innocence
be
but
another
proof
of
a
sneak
and
crafty
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
by
slow
degree
,
however
,
he
be
reconcile
to
him
in
the
end
;
and
even
go
so
far
as
to
honour
him
with
his
patronage
,
as
one
who
have
in
some
measure
reform
,
and
be
therefore
to
be
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
never
forget
or
pardon
that
circumstance
of
the
shilling
;
<EOS>
hold
that
if
he
have
come
back
to
get
another
he
would
have
do
well
enough
,
but
that
his
return
to
work
out
the
former
gift
be
a
stain
upon
his
moral
character
which
no
penitence
or
contrition
could
ever
wash
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Swiveller
,
have
always
be
in
some
measure
of
a
philosophic
and
reflective
turn
,
grow
immensely
contemplative
,
at
time
,
in
the
smoking
-
box
,
and
be
accustom
at
such
period
to
debate
in
his
own
mind
the
mysterious
question
of
Sophronia
's
parentage
.
<EOS>
Sophronia
herself
suppose
she
be
an
orphan
;
but
Mr
Swiveller
,
put
various
slight
circumstance
together
,
often
think
Miss
Brass
must
know
better
than
that
;
and
,
have
hear
from
his
wife
of
her
strange
interview
with
Quilp
,
entertain
sundry
misgiving
whether
that
person
,
in
his
lifetime
,
may
not
also
have
be
able
to
solve
the
riddle
,
have
he
choose
.
 
<EOS>
these
speculation
,
however
,
give
him
no
uneasiness
;
for
Sophronia
be
ever
a
most
cheerful
,
affectionate
,
and
provident
wife
to
him
;
and
Dick
(
except
for
an
occasional
outbreak
with
Mr
Chuckster
,
which
she
have
the
good
sense
rather
to
encourage
than
oppose
)
be
to
her
an
attach
and
domesticate
husband
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
play
many
hundred
thousand
game
of
cribbage
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
let
it
be
add
,
to
Dick
's
honour
,
that
,
though
we
have
call
her
Sophronia
,
he
call
her
the
Marchioness
from
first
to
last
;
and
that
upon
every
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
he
find
her
in
his
sick
room
,
Mr
Chuckster
come
to
dinner
,
and
there
be
great
glorification
.
  
<EOS>
the
gambler
,
Isaac
List
and
Jowl
,
with
their
trusty
confederate
Mr
James
Groves
of
unimpeachable
memory
,
pursue
their
course
with
vary
success
,
until
the
failure
of
a
spirited
enterprise
in
the
way
of
their
profession
,
disperse
them
in
various
direction
,
and
cause
their
career
to
receive
a
sudden
check
from
the
long
and
strong
arm
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
this
defeat
have
its
origin
in
the
untoward
detection
of
a
new
associate
---
young
Frederick
Trent
---
who
thus
become
the
unconscious
instrument
of
their
punishment
and
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
young
man
himself
,
he
riot
abroad
for
a
brief
term

live
by
his

which

by
the
abuse

every
faculty
that
worthily
employ
raise

above
the
beast
,
and
so
degraded

sink
him
far
below
them

<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
his
body
be
recognise
by
a
stranger
,
who
chance
to
visit
that
hospital
in
Paris
where
the

despite
the
bruise
and
disfigurement
which
be
say
to
have
be
occasion
by
some
previous
scuffle

<EOS>
but
the
stranger
keep
his
own
counsel
until
he
return
home
,
and
it
be
never
claim
or
care
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
brother
,
or
the
single
gentleman
,
for
that
designation
be
more
familiar
,
would
have
draw
the
poor
schoolmaster
from
his
lone
retreat
,
and
make
him
his
companion
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
humble
village
teacher
be
timid
of
venture
into
the
noisy
world
,
and
have
become
fond
of
his
dwelling
in
the

.

calmly
happy
in

,
and
in

and
in

he

and
be

through
the
righteous
gratitude

let
this
brief
mention
suffice
for
that

a
POOR

that

have
at

a
heavy

him
no
misanthropy
or

gloom
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
forth
into
the
world
,
a
lover
of
his
kind
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
long
,
long
time
,
it
be
his
chief
delight
to
travel
in
the
step
of
the
old
man
and
the
child
(
so
far
as
he
could
trace
them
from
her
last
narrative
)
,
to
halt

kit

story
have
get
abroad
,
raise
him
up
a
host
of
friend
,
and
many
offer
of
provision
for
his
future
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
at
first
of
ever
quit
Mr
Garland
's
service
;
but
,
after
serious
remonstrance
and
advice
from
that
gentleman
,
begin
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
such
a
change
be
bring
about
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
post
be
procure
for
him
,
with
a
rapidity
which
take
away
his
breath
,
by
some
of
the
gentleman
who
have
believe
him
guilty
of
the
offence
lay
to
his
charge
,
and
who
have
act
upon
that
belief
.
<EOS>
through
the
same
kind
agency
,
his
mother
be
secure
from
want
,
and
make
quite
happy
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
as
kit
often
say
,
his
great
misfortune
turn
out
to
be
the
source
of
all
his
subsequent
prosperity
.
  
<EOS>
do
Kit
live
a
single
man
all
his
day
,
or
do
he
marry
?
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
marry
,
and
who
should
be
his
wife
but
Barbara
?
 
<EOS>
and
the
good
of
it
be
,
he
marry
so
soon
that
little
Jacob
be
an
uncle
,
before
the
calf
of
his
leg
,
already
mention
in
this
history
,
have
ever
be
encase
in
broadcloth
pantaloon
,
---
though
that
be
not
quite
the
good
either
,
for
of
necessity
the
baby
be
an
uncle
too
.
 
<EOS>
the
delight
of
kit
's
mother
and
of
Barbara
's
mother
upon
the
great
occasion
be
past
all
tell
;
find
they
agree
so
well
on
that
,
and
on
all
other
subject
,
they
take
up
their
abode
together
,
and
be
a
most
harmonious
pair
of
friend
from
that
time
forth
.
<EOS>
and
have
not
Astley
's
cause
to
bless
itself
for
their
all
go
together
once
a
quarter
---
to
the
pit
---
and
do
not
kit
's
mother
always
say
,
when
they
paint
the
outside
,
that
kit
's
last
treat
have
help
to
that
,
and
wonder
what
the
manager
would
feel
if
he
but
know
it
as
they
pass
his
house
!
  
<EOS>
when
kit
have
child
six
and
seven
year
old
,
there
be
a
Barbara
among
them
,
and
a
pretty
Barbara
<EOS>
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
there
want
an
exact
facsimile
and
copy
of
little
Jacob
,
as
he
appear
in
those
remote
time
when
they
teach
him
what
oyster
mean
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
an
Abel
,
own
godson
to
the
Mr
Garland
of
that
name
;
and
there
be
a
Dick
,
whom
Mr
Swiveller
do
especially
favour
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
group
would
often
gather
round
him
of
a
night
and
beg
him
to
tell
again
that
story
of
good
Miss
Nell
who
die
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
kit
would
do
;
and
when
they
cry
to
hear
it
,
wish
it
longer
too
,
he
would
teach
them
how
she
have
go
to
Heaven
,
as
all
good
people
do
;
and
how
,
if
they
be
good
,
like
her
,
they
may
hope
to
be
there
too
,
one
day
,
and
to
see
and
know
her
as
he
have
do
when
he
be
quite
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
would
relate
to
them
how
needy
he
use
to
be
,
and
how
she
have
teach
him
what
he
be
otherwise
too
poor
to
learn
,
and
how
the
old
man
have
be
use
to
say
"
she
always
laugh
at
kit
;
"
at
which
they
would
brush
away
their
tear
,
and
laugh
themselves
to
think
that
she
have
do
so
,
and
be
again
quite
merry
.
  
<EOS>
He
sometimes
take
them
to
the
street
where
she
have
live
;
but
new
improvement
have
alter
it
so
much
,
it
be
not
like
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
house
have
be
long
ago
pull
down
,
and
a
fine
broad
road
be
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
would
draw
with
his
stick
a
square
upon
the
ground
to
show
them
where
it
use
to
stand
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
soon
become
uncertain
of
the
spot
,
and
could
only
say
it
be
thereabout
,
he
think
,
and
these
alteration
be
confusing
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
change
which
a
few
year
bring
about
,
and
so
do
thing
pass
away
,
like
a
tale
that
be
tell
!
