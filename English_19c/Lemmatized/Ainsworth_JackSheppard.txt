the
Widow

Child

<EOS>
on
the
night
of
Friday
,
the
26th
of
November
,
1703
,
and
at
the
hour
of
eleven
,
the
door
of
a
miserable
habitation
,
situate
in
an
obscure
quarter
of
the
Borough
of
Southwark
,
know
as
the
Old
Mint
,
be
open
;
and
a
man
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
appear
at
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
this
person
,
whose
age
may
be
about
forty
,
be
attire
in
a
brown
double
-
breast
frieze
coat
,
with
very
wide
skirt
,
and
a
very
narrow
collar
;
a
light
drugget
waistcoat
,
with
pocket
reach
to
the
knee
;
black
plush
breech
;
grey
worst
hose
;
and
shoe
with
round
toe
,
wooden
heel
,
and
high
quarter
,
fasten
by
small
silver
buckle
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
three
-
cornered
hat
,
a
sandy
-
coloured
scratch
wig
,
and
have
a
thick
woollen
wrapper
fold
round
his
throat
.
<EOS>
His
clothe
have
evidently
see
some
service
,
and
be
plentifully
begrime
with
the
dust
of
the
workshop
.
<EOS>
still
he
have
a
decent
look
,
and
decidedly
the
air
of
one
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
stature
,
he
be
short
and
stumpy
;
in
person
,
corpulent
;
and
in
countenance
,
sleek
,
snub
-
nosed
,
and
demure
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
behind
this
individual
,
come
a
pale
,
poverty
-
stricken
woman
,
whose
forlorn
aspect
contrast
strongly
with
his
plump
and
comfortable
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
a
tattered
black
stuff
gown
,
discolour
by
various
stain
,
and
intend
,
it
would
seem
,
from
the
remnant
of
rusty
crape
with
which
it
be
here
and
there
trick
out
,
to
represent
the
garb
of
widowhood
,
and
hold
in
her
arm
a
sleep
infant
,
swathe
in
the
fold
of
a
linsey
-
woolsey
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
her
emaciation
,
her
feature
still
retain
something
of
a
pleasing
expression
,
and
may
have
be
term
beautiful
,
have
it
not
be
for
that
repulsive
freshness
of
lip
denote
the
habitual
dram
-
drinker
;
a
freshness
in
her
case
render
the
more
shocking
from
the
almost
livid
hue
of
the
rest
of
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
;
and
though
want
and
other
suffering
have
do
the
work
of
time
,
have
waste
her
frame
,
and
rob
her
cheek
of
its
bloom
and
roundness
,
they
have
not
extinguish
the
lustre
of
her
eye
,
nor
thin
her
raven
hair
.
<EOS>
check
an
ominous
cough
,
that
,
ever
and
anon
,
convulse
her
lung
,
the
poor
woman
address
a
few
parting
word
to
her
companion
,
who
linger
at
the
doorway
as
if
he
have
something
on
his
mind
,
which
he
do
not
very
well
know
how
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
good
night
,
Mr.
Wood
,
"
say
she
,
in
the
deep
,
hoarse
accent
of
consumption
;
"
and
may
God
Almighty
bless
and
reward
you
for
your
kindness
!
<EOS>
You
be
always
the
good
of
master
to
my
poor
husband
;
and
now
you
have
prove
the
good
of
friend
to
his
widow
and
orphan
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
say
no
more
about
it
,
"
rejoin
the
man
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
no
more
than
my
duty
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
and
neither
deserve
nor
desire
your
thank
.
'
<EOS>
Whoso
giveth
to
the
poor
lendeth
to
the
Lord
;
'
that
be
my
comfort
.
<EOS>
and
such
slight
relief
as
I
can
afford
should
have
be
offer
earlier
,
if
I
would
know
where
you
would
take
refuge
after
your
unfortunate
husband's--
"
 
"
execution
,
you
would
say
,
Sir
,
"
add
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
perceive
that
her
benefactor
hesitate
to
pronounce
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
You
show
more
consideration
to
the
feeling
of
a
hempen
widow
,
than
there
be
any
need
to
show
.
<EOS>
I
be
use
to
insult
as
I
be
to
misfortune
,
and
be
grow
callous
to
both
;
but
I
be
_
not
_
use
to
compassion
,
and
know
not
how
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
My
heart
would
speak
if
it
could
,
for
it
be
very
full
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
time
,
long
,
long
ago
,
when
the
tear
would
have
rush
to
my
eye
unbidden
at
the
bare
mention
of
generosity
like
yours
,
Mr.
Wood
;
but
they
never
come
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
weep
since
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
trust
you
will
never
have
occasion
to
weep
again
,
my
poor
soul
,
"
reply
Wood
,
set
down
his
lantern
,
and
brush
a
few
drop
from
his
eye
,
"
unless
it
be
tear
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
add
he
,
make
an
effort
to
subdue
his
emotion
<EOS>
,
"
I
can
not
leave
you
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
must
stay
a
minute
longer
,
if
only
to
see
you
smile
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
re
-
enter
the
house
,
close
the
door
,
and
,
follow
by
the
widow
,
proceed
to
the
fire
-
place
,
where
a
handful
of
chip
,
apparently
just
light
,
crackle
within
the
rusty
grate
.

room
in
which

interview

and

look

Rotten

and

with
a
thick
coat
of
dirt
,
the
board
of
the
floor

very
insecure
footing

the
bare
wall

where

<EOS>
over
an
old
crazy

patchwork
counterpane

and
upon
the
counterpane

a

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
Old
Mint

habitation

a
row
of
old
ruinous
building

and
part
lane

from
Mint

through
a
variety
of
turning
,
and
along
the
brink
of
a
deep
kennel
,

by
a
number
of
petty
and
neglect
garden
in
the
direction
of
Saint
George
's
Fields
.
<EOS>

neighbouring
house

tenant
by
the
low
order
of
insolvent
trader
,
thief
,
mendicant
,
and
other
worthless
and
nefarious
character
,
who
flee
thither
to
escape
from
their
creditor
,
or
to
avoid
the
punishment
due
to
their
different
offense
;
for
we
may
observe
that
the
Old
Mint
,
although
it
have
be
divest
of
some
of
its
privilege
as
a
sanctuary
by
a
recent
statute
pass
in
the
reign
of
William
the
Third
,
still
present
a
safe
asylum
to
the
debtor
,
and
even
continue
to
do
so
until
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
George
the
First
,
when
the
cry
nature
of
the
evil
call
loudly
for
a
remedy
,
and
another
and
more
sweeping
enactment
entirely
take
away
its
immunity
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
the
encouragement
thus
offer
to
dishonesty
,
and
the
security
afford
to
crime
,
this
quarter
of
the
Borough
of
Southwark

account

at
the
period
of
our
narrative

grand
receptacle

superfluous
villainy
of

by
every
description
of
vagabond
and
miscreant
,
it
be
,
perhaps
,
a
few
degree
bad
than
the
rookery
near
Saint
Giles
's
and
the
desperate
neighbourhood
of
Saffron
Hill
in
our
own
time
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
on
the
very
site
of
the
sordid
tenement
and
squalid
court

have
mention

where

felon

his
dwelling

the
fraudulent
debtor

object
of
his
knavery
to
scorn

on
this
spot

<EOS>
old
and
dilapidated
,
the
widow

domicile
look
the
very
picture
of
desolation
and
misery
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
forlorn
could
be
conceive
.
<EOS>
the
roof
be
partially
untiled
;
the

and

most
of
the
window
be

and

while

in
some
case

the
very
frame

<EOS>
on

singular

patch
all
over
with
the

and
bit

of
the
former
occupant
of
the
apartment
,
Paul
Groves
,
the
cobbler
,
to
whom
we
have
before
allude
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
the
untimely
end
of
this
poor
fellow
that
Mrs.
Sheppard
be
enable
to
take
possession
of
the
premise
.
<EOS>
in
a
fit
of
despondency
,
superinduce
by
drunkenness
,
he
make
away
with
himself
;
and
when
the
body
be
discover
,
after
a
lapse
of
some
month
,
such
be
the
impression
produce
by
the
spectacle
--
such
the
alarm
occasion
by
the
crazy
state
of
the
building
,
and
,
above
all
,
by
the
terror
inspire
by
strange
and
unearthly
noise
hear
during
the
night
,
which
be
,
of
course
,
attribute
to
the
spirit
of
the
suicide
,
that
the
place
speedily
enjoy
the
reputation
of
be
haunt
,
and
be
,
consequently
,
entirely
abandon
.
<EOS>
in
this
state
Mrs.
Sheppard
find
it
;
and
,
as
no
one
oppose
her
,
she
at
once
take
up
her
abode
there
;
nor
be
she
long
in
discover
that
the
dread
sound
proceed
from
the
nocturnal
gambol
of
a
legion
of
rat
.
 
<EOS>
a
narrow
entry
,
form
by
two
low
wall
,
communicate
with
the
main
thoroughfare
;
and
in
this
passage
,
under
the
cover
of
a
penthouse
,
stand
Wood
,
with
his
little
burthen
,
to
whom
we
shall
now
return
.
 
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Sheppard
do
not
make
her
appearance
quite
so
soon
as
he
expect
,
the
carpenter
become
a
little
fidgetty
,
and
,
have
succeed
in
tranquillize
the
child
,
he
think
proper
to
walk
so
far
down
the
entry
as
would
enable
him
to
reconnoitre
the
upper
window
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
a
light
be
visible
in
the
garret
,
feebly
struggle
through
the
damp
atmosphere
,
for
the
night
be
raw
and
overcast
.
<EOS>
this
light
do
not
remain
stationary
,
but
could
be
see
at
one
moment
glimmer
through
the
rent
in
the
roof
,
and
at
another
shining
through
the
crack
in
the
wall
,
or
the
broken
pane
of
the
casement
.
<EOS>
wood
be
unable
to
discover
the
figure
of
the
widow
,
but
he
recognise
her
dry
,
hack
cough
,
and
be
about
to
call
her
down
,
if
she
could
not
find
the
key
,
as
he
imagine
must
be
the
case
,
when
a
loud
noise
be
hear
,
as
though
a
chest
,
or
some
weighty
substance
,
have
fall
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
before
Wood
have
time
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
this
sound
,
his
attention
be
divert
by
a
man
,
who
rush
past
the
entry
with
the
swiftness
of
desperation
.
<EOS>
this
individual
apparently
meet
with
some
impediment
to
his
further
progress
;
for
he
have
not
proceed
many
step
when
he
turn
suddenly
about
,
and
dart
up
the
passage
in
which
Wood
stand
.
 
<EOS>
utter
a
few
inarticulate
<EOS>
ejaculations,--for
he
be
completely
out
of
breath,--the
fugitive
place
a
bundle
in
the
arm
of
the
carpenter
,
and
,
regardless
of
the
consternation
he
excite
in
the
breast
of
that
personage
,
who
be
almost
stupifie
with
astonishment
,
he
begin
to
divest
himself
of
a
heavy
horseman
's
cloak
,
which
he
throw
over
Wood
's
shoulder
,
and
,
draw
his
sword
,
<EOS>
seem
to
listen
intently
for
the
approach
of
his
pursuer
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
new
-
comer
be
extremely
prepossessing
;
and
,
after
his
trepidation
have
a
little
subsided
,
Wood
begin
to
regard
him
with
some
degree
of
interest
.
<EOS>
evidently
in
the
flower
of
his
age
,
he
be
scarcely
less
remarkable
for
symmetry
of
person
than
for
comeliness
of
feature
;
and
,
though
his
attire
be
plain
and
unpretending
,
it
be
such
as
could
be
wear
only
by
one
belong
to
the
high
rank
of
society
.
<EOS>
His
figure
be
tall
and
commanding
,
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
(
though
somewhat
disturb
by
his
recent
exertion
)
be
resolute
and
stern
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
a
cry
burst
from
the
child
,
who
,
nearly
smother
by
the
weight
impose
upon
him
,
only
recover
the
use
of
his
lung
as
Wood
alter
the
position
of
the
bundle
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
turn
his
head
at
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
Heaven
!
"
cry
he
in
a
tone
of
surprise
,
"
you
have
an
infant
there
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
I
have
,
"
reply
Wood
,
angrily
;
for
,
find
that
the
intention
of
the
stranger
be
pacific
,
so
far
as
he
be
concern
,
he
think
he
may
safely
venture
on
a
slight
display
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
well
you
have
not
crush
the
poor
little
thing
to
death
with
this
confound
clothes'-bag
.
<EOS>
but
some
people
have
no
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
child
may
be
the
mean
of
save
me
,
"
mutter
the
stranger
,
as
if
strike
by
a
new
idea
:
"
I
shall
gain
time
by
the
expedient
.
<EOS>
do
you
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
exactly
,
"
answer
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
matter
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
,
so
it
be
needless
to
ask
leave
to
enter
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
stranger
,
as
shout
and
other
vociferation
resound
at
no
great
distance
along
the
thoroughfare
,
"
not
a
moment
be
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
give
me
that
precious
charge
,
"
he
add
,
snatch
the
bundle
from
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
escape
,
I
will
reward
you
.
<EOS>
Your
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Owen
Wood
,
"
reply
the
carpenter
;
"
I
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
a
fair
exchange
,
Sir

<EOS>
yours

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
hesitate
.
<EOS>
the
shout
draw
near
,
and
light
be
see
flash
ruddily
against
the
side
and
gable
of
the
neighbouring
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
be
Darrell
,
"
say
the
fugitive
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
be
discover
,
answer
no
question
,
as
you
value
your
life

<EOS>
wrap
yourself
in
my
cloak
,
and
keep
it
.
<EOS>
remember
!
<EOS>
not

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
huddle
the
mantle
over
Wood
's
shoulder
,
dash
the
lantern
to
the
ground
,
and
extinguish
the
light
.
<EOS>
a
moment
afterwards
,
the
door
be
close
and
bolt
,
and
the
carpenter
find
himself
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
the
dutchman

after
all

"
 
<EOS>
this
exclamation
have
scarcely
escape
him
,
when
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
be
hear
,
and
a
bullet
whiz
past
his
ear

<EOS>
"
I

"
<EOS>
cry
a
voice
in
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
,
then
,
rush
up
the
entry
,
and
,
seize
the
unlucky
carpenter
by
the
collar

this
person

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Damnation

"
exclaim
one
of
the
leader
of
the
party
in
a
furious
tone
,
snatch
a
torch
from
an
attendant
,
and
throw
its
light
full
upon
the
face
of
the
carpenter
;
"
this

<EOS>
"
so
I

Rowland

the
other
,
in
accent
of
deep
disappointment
,
and
at
the

time
relinquish
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"
I

have

It

<EOS>
continue
he

haughtily

<EOS>
"
throttle
a
man

the

doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
nothing
out

,
I
can
promise
you

<EOS>
"
We

Sir

the
object

beyond

refuge
in

search
it

"
 
<EOS>
just
then
,
the
infant

to
sob
piteously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hist

<EOS>
cry
Rowland
,
arrest
his
comrade

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
We

the
mantle
from
Wood

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
It

,
furthermore
,
defend
by
high
wall
and
deep
ditch
in

quarter
where
it
appear
most
expose

<EOS>
there
be
also
a
Maze
,
(
the

still
retain
in
the
district

into
which
the

could
run

in

every
contrivance
that

devise
be
resort
to

this
horde
of

from
danger

lose
its
privilege
;
Salisbury
Court

the
Savoy
no
longer
offer
place
of
refuge
to
the

;
and
it
be
,
therefore
,
<EOS>
doubly
requisite
that
the
Island
of

(
as

by

aware

if
he
mean
to

any
effectual
assistance

he
cease

himself
in
the
good

the
attack
of

by

he
be
closely
press
,
force
his
way
,
in
spite
of
all
opposition
,
to

and
deal
him
a
blow
on

with
such
good
will
that

at

He
feel
he

storm

it

very
difficult

He
know

up
to

on

of

"

Jonathan
kimbaw
the

<EOS>
He

the
gift
of

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
crowd
accordingly
draw
aside
,
and
the
individual
,
in
whose
behalf
the
movement
have
be
make
immediately
step
forward
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
of
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
who
,
without
have
anything
remarkable
either
in
dress
or
appearance
,
be
yet
a
noticeable
person
,
if
only
for
the
indescribable
expression
of
cunne
pervade
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
small
and
grey
;
as
far
apart
and
as
sly
-
look
as
those
of
a
fox
.
<EOS>
a
physiognomist
,
indeed
,
would
have
liken
him
to
that
crafty
animal
,
and
it
must
be
own
the
general
formation
of
his
feature
favour
such
a
comparison
.
<EOS>
the
nose
be
long
and
sharp
,
the
chin
point
,
the
forehead
broad
and
flat
,
and
connect
,
without
any
intervene
hollow
,
with
the
eyelid
;
the
tooth
when
display
,
seem
to
reach
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
then
his
beard
be
of
a
reddish
hue
,
and
his
complexion
warm
and
sanguine
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
see
him
slumber
,
aver
that
he
sleep
with
his
eye
open
.
<EOS>
but
this
may
be
merely
a
figurative
mode
of
describe
his
customary
vigilance
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
that
the
slight
sound
arouse
him
.
<EOS>
this
astute
personage
be
somewhat
under
the
middle
size
,
but
fairly
proportion
,
incline
rather
to
strength
than
symmetry
,
and
abound
more
in
muscle
than
in
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
,
from
the
attention
which
he
evidently
bestow
upon
the
hidden
and
complex
machinery
of
the
grand
system
of
villany
at
work
around
him
,
that
his
chief
object
in
take
up
his
quarter
in
the
Mint
,
must
have
be
to
obtain
some
private
information
respect
the
habit
and
practice
of
its
inhabitant
,
to
be
turn
to
account
hereafter
.
 
<EOS>
advance
towards
Wood
,
Jonathan
fix
his
keen
gray
eye
upon
him
,
and
demand
,
in
a
stern
tone
whether
the
person
who
have
take
refuge
in
the
adjoining
house
,
be
bailiff
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
know
of

"
reply
the
carpenter
,
who
have
in
some
degree
recover
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
presume
you
have
not

arrest

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
,
"
answer
Wood
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guess
as
much
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
next
inform
us
why
you
have
occasion
this
disturbance

"
 
<EOS>
"
because
this
child

<EOS>
"
an
excellent

exclaim
Blueskin

with
a
roar
of
surprise
and
indignation
,
which
be
echo
by
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
we
be
to
be
summon
from
our
bed
and
snug
fireside
,
because
a
kid
happen
to
squall
,
eh
?
<EOS>
by
the
soul
of
my
grandmother

this
be
too
good

"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
intend
to
claim
the
privilege
of
the
Mint

"
say
Jonathan
,
calmly
pursue
his
interrogation
amid
the
uproar
.
<EOS>
"
be
your
person
in
danger
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
from
my
creditor
,
"
reply
Wood
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
he
post
the
cole
?
<EOS>
Will
he
come
down
with
the
due
?
<EOS>
ask
him
that
?
"
cry
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
,
"
pursue
Jonathan
;
"
my
friend
desire
to
know
if
you

willing

your
footing

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
no

a

my

never

any
such
rascally

reply
Wood
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
be
oblige
to
pay
for
do
my
duty

<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
child
would
have
be
strangle

<EOS>
the
noose
be
at
its
throat
when
I
call
for
help

<EOS>
I
know
it
be
in
vain
to
cry
'
murder

'
<EOS>
in
the
Mint
,
so
I
have
recourse
to
stratagem

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Sir
,
I
must
say
you
deserve
some
credit
for
your
ingenuity
,
at
all
event

"
reply
Jonathan
,
repress
a
smile
;
"
but
,
before
you
put
out
your
foot
so
far
,
it
would
have
be
quite
as
prudent
to
consider
how
you
be
to
draw
it
back
again

<EOS>
for
my
own
part

I
do
not
see
in
what
way
it
be

be
accomplish

yourself
of
our
excellent
regulation

with

you

the

break
them

by

<EOS>
it
be
only
natural
to
presume
that
a
man
who
owe
nothing
must
be
in
a
condition
to
pay
liberally,--and
<EOS>
you
can
not

feel
the
loss

such
a

ten
guinea

<EOS>
however
illogical

inconclusive
these

may
appear
to
Mr.

he
may
dissent
from
the
latter
proposition

he
do
not

it

CHAPTER
III
.
 
<EOS>
the
Master
of
the
Mint
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
meanwhile
,
have
ascertain
the
parentage
of
the
child
from
Wood
,
proceed
to
question
him
in
an
under
tone
,
as
to
the
probable
motive
of
the
attempt
upon
its
life
;
and
,
though
he
fail
in
obtain
any
information
on
this
point
,
he
have
little
difficulty
in
elicit
such
particular
of
the
mysterious
transaction
as
have
already
be
recount
.
<EOS>
when
the
carpenter
conclude
his
recital
,
Jonathan
be
for
a
moment
lose
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
devilish
strange
!
"
<EOS>
think
he
,
chuckle
to
himself
;
"
queer
business
!
<EOS>
capital
trick
of
the
cull
in
the
cloak
to
make
another
person
's
brat
stand
the
brunt
for
his
own
--
capital
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
will
not
do
,
though
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
sly
fox
to
get
out
of
the
Mint
without
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
shrewd
guess
where
he
be
take
refuge
;
but
I
will
ferret
him
out
.
<EOS>
these
blood
will
pay
well
for
his
capture
;
if
not
,
_
he
will
_
pay
well
to
get
out
of
their
hand
;
so
I
be
safe
either
way
--
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
"
he
add
aloud
,
and
motion
that
worthy
,
"
follow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
he
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
entry
.
<EOS>
His
progress
,
however
,
be
check
by
loud
acclamation
,
announce
the
arrival
of
the
Master
of
the
Mint
and
his
train
.
 
<EOS>
Baptist
Kettleby
(
for
so
be
the
Master
name
)
be
a
"
goodly
portly
man
,
and
a
corpulent
,
"
<EOS>
whose
fair
round
paunch
bespeak
the
affection
he
entertain
for
good
liquor
and
good
living
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
quick
,
shrewd
,
merry
eye
,
and
a
look
in
which
duplicity
be
agreeably
veil
by
good
humour
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
discover
that
he
be
a
knave
,
but
equally
easy
to
perceive
that
he
be
a
pleasant
fellow
;
a
combination
of
quality
by
no
means
of
rare
occurrence
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
regard
his
attire
,
Baptist
be
not
see
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
no
great
lover
of
state
or
state
costume
at
any
time
,
he
be
generally
,
towards
the
close
of
an
evening
,
completely
in
dishabille
,
and
in
this
condition
he
now
present
himself
to
his
subject
.
<EOS>
His
shirt
be
unfastened
,
his
vest
unbuttoned
,
his
hose
ungartered
;
his
foot
be
stick
into
a
pair
of
pantoufle
,
his
arm
into
a
greasy
flannel
dressing
-
gown
,
his
head
into
a
thrum
-
cap
,
the
cap
into
a
tie
-
periwig
,
and
the
wig
into
a
gold
-
edge
hat
.
<EOS>
a
white
apron
be
tie
round
his
waist
,
and
into
the
apron
be
thrust
a
short
thick
truncheon
,
which
look
very
much
like
a
rolling
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
the
Master
of
the
Mint
be
accompany
by
another
gentleman
almost
as
portly
as
himself
,
and
quite
as
deliberate
in
his
movement
.
<EOS>
the
costume
of
this
personage
be
somewhat
singular
,
and
may
have
pass
for
a
masquerading
habit
,
have
not
the
imperturbable
gravity
of
his
demeanour
forbid
any
such
supposition
.
<EOS>
It
consist
of
a
close
jerkin
of
brown
frieze
,
ornament
with
a
triple
row
of
brass
button
;
loose
dutch
slop
,
make
very
wide
in
the
seat
and
very
tight
at
the
knee
;
red
stocking
with
black
clock
,
and
a
fur
cap
.
<EOS>
the
owner
of
this
dress
have
a
broad
weather
-
beat
face
,
small
twinkle
eye
,
and
a
bushy
,
grizzle
beard
.
<EOS>
though
he
walk
by
the
side
of
the
governor
,
he
seldom
exchange
a
word
with
him
,
but
appear
wholly
absorb
in
the
contemplation
inspire
by
a
broadbowled
dutch
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
behind
the
illustrious
personage
<EOS>
just
describe
march
a
troop
of
stalwart
fellow
,
with
white
badge
in
their
hat
,
quarterstaff
,
oaken
cudgel
,
and
link
in
their
hand
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
Master
's
body
-
guard
.
 
<EOS>
advance
towards
the
Master
,
and
claim
an
audience
,
which
be
instantly
grant
,
Jonathan
,
without
much
circumlocution
,
relate
the
sum
of
the
strange
story
he
have
just
learn
from
Wood
,
omit
nothing
except
a
few
trifling
particular
,
which
he
think
it
politic
to
keep
back
;
and
,
with
this
view
,
he
say
not
a
word
of
there
be
any
probability
of
capture
the
fugitive
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
roundly
assert
that
his
informant
have
witness
that
person
's
escape
.
 
<EOS>
the
Master
listen
,
with
become
attention
,
to
the
narrative
,
and
,
at
its
conclusion
,
shake
his
head
gravely
,
apply
his
thumb
to
the
side
of
his
nose
,
and
,
twirl
his
finger
significantly
,
wink
at
his
phlegmatic
companion
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
appeal
to
shook
his
head
in
reply
,
cough
as
only
a
Dutchman
_
can
_
cough
,
and
raise
his
hand
from
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
,
go
through
precisely
the
same
mysterious
ceremonial
as
the
Master
.
 
<EOS>
put
his
own
construction
upon
this
mute
interchange
of
opinion
,
Jonathan
venture
to
observe
,
that
it
certainly
be
a
very
perplexing
case
,
but
that
he
think
something
_
may
_
be
make
of
it
,
and
,
if
leave
to
him
,
he
would
undertake
to
manage
the
matter
to
the
Master
's
entire
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ja

the
Dutchman
,
remove
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
,

the

CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
the
Roof
and
the
Window
.
  
<EOS>
leave
them
to
pursue
their
conference
,
we
shall
follow
the
footstep
of
Jonathan
,
who
,
as
the
Master
surmise
,
and
,
as
we
have
intimate
,
have
unquestionably
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
affray
,
when
he
think
every
one
be
too
much
occupy
with
his
own
concern
to
remark
his
absence
,
he
slip
out
of
the
room
,
not
for
the
purpose
of
avoid
the
engagement
(
for
cowardice
be
not
one
of
his
failing
)
,
but
because
he
have
another
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
creep
stealthily
up
stair
,
unmask
a
dark
lantern
,
and
glance
into
each
room
as
he
pass
,
he
be
startle
in
one
of
them
by
the
appearance
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
seem
to
be
crouch
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
satisfied
,
however
,
that
she
do
not
notice
him
,
Jonathan
glide
away
as
noiselessly
as
he
come
,
and
ascend
another
short
flight
of
stair
lead
to
the
garret
.
<EOS>
as
he
cross
this
chamber
,
his
foot
strike
against
something
on
the
floor
,
which
nearly
throw
him
down
,
and
stoop
to
examine
the
object
,
he
find
it
be
a
key
.
<EOS>
"
never
throw
away
a
chance
,
"
think
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
know
but
this
key
may
open
a
golden
lock
one
of
these
day
?
"
<EOS>
and
,
pick
it
up
,
he
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
beneath
an
aperture
in
the
broken
roof
,
he
be
prepare
to
pass
through
it
,
when
he
observe
a
little
heap
of
tile
upon
the
floor
,
which
appear
to
have
be
recently
dislodge
.
"
<EOS>
He
_
have
_
pass
this
way
,
"
cry
Jonathan
,
exultingly
;
"
I
have
him
safe
enough
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
close
the
lantern
,
mount
without
much
difficulty
upon
the
roof
,
and
proceed
cautiously
along
the
tile
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
now
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
have
to
feel
his
way
.
<EOS>
a
single
false
step
may
have
precipitate
him
into
the
street
;
or
,
if
he
have
trodden
upon
an
unsound
part
of
the
roof
,
he
must
have
fall
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
guide
him
;
for
though
the
torch
be
blaze
ruddily
below
,
their
gleam
fall
only
on
the
side
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
the
venturous
climber
gaze
for
a
moment
at
the
assemblage
beneath
,
to
ascertain
that
he
be
not
discover
;
and
,
have
satisfy
himself
in
this
particular
,
he
step
out
more
boldly
.
<EOS>
on
gain
a
stack
of
chimney
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
he
come
to
a
pause
,
and
again
unmask
his
lantern
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
could
be
discern
,
except
the
crumble
brickwork
.
<EOS>
"
Confusion
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Jonathan
:
"
can
he
have
escape
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
too
high
,
and
the
window
too
stoutly
barricade
in
this
quarter
,
to
admit
such
a
supposition
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
I
shall
find
him
yet
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
have
it
,
"
he
add
,
after
a
moment
's
deliberation
;
<EOS>
"
he
be
there
,
I
will
be
swear
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
once
more
envelop
himself
in
darkness
,
he
pursue
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
now
reach
the
adjoining
house
,
and
,
scale
the
roof
,
approach
another
building
,
which
seem
to
be
,
at
least
,
one
story
lofty
than
its
neighbour
.
<EOS>
apparently
,
Jonathan
be
well
acquaint
with
the
premise
;
for
,
feel
about
in
the
dark
,
he
speedily
discover
a
ladder
,
up
the
step
of
which
he
hurry
.
<EOS>
draw
a
pistol
,
and
unclose
his
lantern
with
the
quickness
of
thought
,
he
then
burst
through
an
open
trap
-
door
into
a
small
loft
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
fall
upon
the
fugitive
,
who
stand
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
defence
,
with
the
child
in
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
aha
!
"
exclaim
Jonathan
,
act
upon
the
information
he
have
obtain
from
Wood
;
"
I
have
find
you
at
last
.
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
Mr.
Darrell
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
!
<EOS>
"
demand
the
fugitive
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
friend
,
"
reply
Jonathan
,
uncocke
the
pistol
,
and
place
it
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
know
you
be
a
friend
?
"
ask
Darrell
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
should
I
do
here
alone
if
I
be
an
enemy
?
<EOS>
but
,
come
,
do
not
let
us
waste
time
in
bandying
word
,
when
we
may
employ
it
so
much
more
profitably
.
<EOS>
Your
life
,
and
that
of
your
child
,
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
what
will
you
give
me
to
save
you
from
your
pursuer
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
Can
_
you
do
so
?
"
ask
the
other
,
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
and
will
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
reward
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
an
ill
-
furnished
purse
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
escape
,
my
gratitude--
"
 
"
Pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
interrupt
Jonathan
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
Your
gratitude
will
vanish
with
your
danger
.
<EOS>
pay
fool
with
promise
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
something
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
all
I
have
about
me
,
"
reply
Darrell
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
--
well
,
"
grumble
Jonathan
,
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
be
content
.
<EOS>
an
ill
-
line
purse
be
a
poor
recompense
for
the
risk
I
have
run
.
<EOS>
however
,
come
along
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
to
tread
carefully
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
danger
of
this
breakneck
road
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
the
light
would
betray
us
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
close
the
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harkye
,
Sir
,
"
rejoin
Darrell
;
"
one
word
before
I
move
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
who
you
be
;
and
,
as
I
can
not
discern
your
face
,
I
may
be
do
you
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
in
your
voice
that
make
me
distrust
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
attempt
to
play
the
traitor
,
you
will
do
so
at
the
hazard
of
your
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
hazard
my
life
in
this
attempt
to
save
you
,
"
return
Jonathan
boldly
,
and
with
apparent
frankness
;
"
this
ought
to
be
sufficient
answer
to
your
doubt
.
<EOS>
Your
pursuer
be
below
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
hinder
me
,
if
I
have
be
so
inclined
,
from
direct
them
to
your
retreat
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
reply
Darrell
.
"
<EOS>
lead
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
follow
by
Darrell
,
Jonathan
retrace
his
dangerous
path
.
<EOS>
as
he
approach
the
gable
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
house
,
loud
yell
and
vociferation
reach
his
ear
;
and
,
look
downward
,
he
perceive
a
great
stir
amid
the
mob
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
uproar
be
soon
manifest
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
and
the
Minters
be
drag
Wood
to
the
pump
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
carpenter
struggle
violently
,
but
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
His
hat
be
place
upon
one
pole
,
his
wig
on
another
.
<EOS>
His
shout
for
help
be
answer
by
roar
of
mockery
and
laughter
.
<EOS>
He
continue
alternately
to
be
toss
in
the
air
,
or
roll
in
the
kennel
until
he
be
bear
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
the
spectacle
seem
to
afford
as
much
amusement
to
Jonathan
as
to
the
actor
engage
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
contain
his
satisfaction
,
but
chuckle
,
and
rub
his
hand
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
Heaven
!
"
cry
Darrell
,
"
it
be
the
poor
fellow
whom
I
place
in
such
jeopardy
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
cause
of
his
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
you
be
,
"
reply
Jonathan
,
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
lesson
to
him
in
future
,
and
will
show
him
the
folly
of
do
a
good
-
natured
action
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
perceive
that
his
companion
do
not
relish
his
pleasantry
and
fear
that
his
sympathy
for
the
carpenter
's
situation
may
betray
him
into
some
act
of
imprudence
,
Jonathan
,
without
further
remark
,
and
by
way
of
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
,
let
himself
drop
through
the
roof
.
<EOS>
His
example
be
follow
by
Darrell
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
the

off
at
full
speed
from
the
Mint
,
and
,
hurry
he
scarce
know
whither
(
for
there
be
such
a
continual
buzzing
in
his
ear
and
dance
in
his
eye
,
as
almost
to
take
away
the
power
of
reflection
)
,
he
hold
on
at
a
brisk
pace
till
his
strength
completely
fail
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
regain
his
breath
,
he
begin
to
consider
whither
chance
have
lead
him
;
and
,
rub
his
eye
to
clear
his
sight
,
he
perceive
a
sombre
pile
,
with
a
lofty
tower
and
broad
roof
,
immediately
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
this
structure
at
once
satisfy
him
as
to
where
he
stand
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
to
be
St.
Saviour
's
Church
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
up
at
the
massive
tower
,
the
clock
toll
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
.
<EOS>
the
solemn
stroke
be
immediately
answer
by
a
multitude
of
chime
,
sound
across
the
Thames
,
amongst
which
the
deep
note
of
Saint
Paul
's
be
plainly
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
a
feeling
of
inexplicable
awe
creep
over
the
carpenter
as
the
sound
die
away
.
<EOS>
He
tremble
,
not
from
any
superstitious
dread
,
but
from
an
undefined
sense
of
approach
danger
.

the
peculiar
appearance
of

be
not

<EOS>
It
be
still
profoundly
dark
;
but
the
wind
,
which
have
begin
to
blow
with
some
violence
,
chase
the
cloud
rapidly
across
the
heavens
,
and
disperse
the
vapour
hang
nearer
the
earth
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
moon
be
totally
eclipse
;
at
other
,
it
shed
a
wan
and
ghastly
glimmer
over
the
masse
roll
in
the
firmament
.
<EOS>
not
a
star
could
be
discern
,
but
,
in
their
stead
,
streak
of
lurid
radiance
,
whence
proceed
it
be
impossible
to
determine
,
shoot
ever
and
anon
athwart
the
dusky
vault

ominous
and
threatening
appearance

Mr.

strain
his
eye
to
catch
a
glimpse

only
discern
a
black
and
shapeless
mass

float
upon

distance

at

moment
,
it
seem
as
if
the
fly

be
about
to
put

this
plan
(
probably
from

danger

Ben
watch
these

answer
sulkily

he
bend
his
eye
upon
the
water
,
as
if
he
wish
to
avert
his
attention
forcibly
from
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
that
inspire
a
feeling
of
inexpressible
melancholy
in
sailing
on
a
dark
night
upon
the
Thames

<EOS>
the
sound
that
reach
the
ear
,
and
the
object
that
meet
the
eye
,
be
all
calculate
to
awaken
a
train
of
sad
and
serious
contemplation
.
<EOS>
the
ripple
of
the
water
against
the
boat
,
as
its
keel
cleave
through
the
stream
--
the
darkle
current
hurrying
by
--
the
indistinctly
-
see
craft
,
of
all
form

all
size
,
hover
around
,
and
make
their
way
in
ghost

like
silence
,

warn
each
other
of
their
approach
by
cry
,
that
,
hear
from
afar

have
something
doleful
in
their
note
--
<EOS>
the
solemn
shadow
cast
by
the
bridge
--
the
deep
gloom
of
the
echo
arch
--
the
light
glimmer
from
the
bank
--
the
red
reflection
throw
upon
the
wave
by
a
fire
kindle
on
some
stationary
barge
--
the
tall
and
fantastic
shape
of
the
house
,
as
discern
through
the
obscurity;--these
,
and
other
sight
and
sound
of
the
same
character
,
give
a
sombre
colour
to
the
thought
of
one
who
may
choose
to
indulge
in
meditation
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
otherwise
with
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
night
for
the
indulgence
of
dreamy
musing
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
night
of
storm
and
terror
,
which
promise
each
moment
to
become
more
stormy
and
more
terrible
.
<EOS>
not
a
bark
could
be

on

those
already

be
suddenly
lull

It
be
a
dead
calm

this
calm
be
more
awful

roaring

amid
this
portentous
hush

the
report
of
a
pistol
reach
the
carpenter

ear
;
and
,
raise
his
head
at
the
sound
,
he
behold
a
sight
which
fill
him
with
fresh
apprehension

<EOS>
by
the
light
of
a
torch
borne
at
the
stern
of

hostile
wherry

he
see
that

approach
within

<EOS>
the
shot
have
take
effect
upon

the
side

a
watery
grave

<EOS>
It
be
a
spring

tide
at
half
ebb

the
current

run
fast

furiously

bore
him
instantly
away

the
struggle

<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
,
Darrell
seem
to
have
the
advantage
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
neither
combatant
could
use
his
sword

and
in
strength
the
fugitive
be
evidently
superior
to
his
antagonist

the
boat
rock
violently
with
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
had
it
not

next
moment

heavy
plunge

Darrell
,
however
,
rise
again
instantly
;
and
though
mortally
wound

make
a
desperate
effort

regain

faintly

CHAPTER
VII
.
 
<EOS>
Old
London
Bridge
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
at
the
period
of
this
history
,
boast
only
a
single
bridge
.
<EOS>
but
that
bridge
be
more
remarkable
than
any
the
metropolis
now
possess
.
<EOS>
cover
with
house
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
this
reverend
and
picturesque
structure
present
the
appearance
of
a
street
across
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
Grace
-
church
Street
,
with
all
its
shop
,
its
magazine
,
and
ceaseless
throng
of
passenger
,
be
stretch
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
old
,
the
shop
gloomy
,
and
the
thoroughfare
narrower
,
it
be
true
;
but
the
bustle
,
the
crowd
,
the
street
-
like
air
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
then
the
bridge
have
arch
gateway
,
bristle
with
spike
,
and
garnish
<EOS>
(
as
all
ancient
gateway
ought
to
be
)
with
the
head
of
traitor
.
<EOS>
in
olden
day
it
boast
a
chapel
,
dedicate
to
Saint
Thomas
;
beneath
which
there
be
a
crypt
curiously
construct
amid
the
arch
,
where
"
be
sepulture
Peter
the
Chaplain
of
Colechurch
,
who
begin
the
Stone
Bridge
at
London
:
"
and
it
still
boast
an
edifice
(
though
now
in
rather
a
tumbledown
condition
)
which
have
once
vie
with
a
palace,--we
mean
Nonesuch
House
.
<EOS>
the
other
building
stand
close
together
in
row
;
and
so
valuable
be
every
inch
of
room
account
,
that
,
in
many
case
,
cellar
,
and
even
habitable
apartment
,
be
construct
in
the
solid
masonry
of
the
pier
.
 
<EOS>
Old
London
Bridge
(
the
grandsire
of
the
present
erection
)
be
support
on
nineteen
arch
,
each
of
which
     
Would
a
Rialto
make
for
depth
and
height
!
 
<EOS>
the
arch
stand
upon
enormous
pier
;
the
pier
on
starling
,
or
jetty
,
build
far
out
into
the
river
to
break
the
force
of
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
rouse
by
Ben
's
warning
,
the
carpenter
look
up
and
could
just
perceive
the
dusky
outline
of
the
bridge
loom
through
the
darkness
,
and
render
indistinctly
visible
by
the
many
light
that
twinkle
from
the
window
of
the
lofty
house
.
<EOS>
as
he
gaze
at
these
light
,
they
suddenly
seem
to
disappear
,
and
a
tremendous
shock
be
feel
throughout
the
frame
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
wood
start
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
the
skiff
have
be
dash
against
one
of
the
buttress
of
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
jump
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Ben
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
Wood
obey
.
<EOS>
His
fear
supply
him
with
unwonted
vigour
.
<EOS>
though
the
starling
be
more
than
two
foot
above
the
level
of
the
water
,
he
alight
with
his
little
charge
--
which
he
have
never
for
an
instant
quit
--
in
safety
upon
it
.
<EOS>
poor
Ben
be
not
so
fortunate
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
be
prepare
to
follow
,
the
wherry
contain
Rowland
and
his
man
,
which
have
drift
in
their
wake
,
be
dash
against
his
boat
.
<EOS>
the
violence
of
the
collision
nearly
throw
him
backwards
,
and
cause
him
to
swerve
as
he
spring
.
<EOS>
His
foot
touch
the
rounded
edge
of
the
starling
,
and
glance
off
,
precipitate
him
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
as
he
fall
,
he
catch
at
the
projecting
masonry
.
<EOS>
but
the
stone
be
slippery
;
and
the
tide
,
which
here
begin
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
fall
,
be
run
with
frightful
velocity
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
good
his
hold
.
<EOS>
but
,
utter
a
loud
cry
,
he
be
sweep
away
by
the
headlong
torrent
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
hear
the
cry
.
<EOS>
but
his
own
situation
be
too
perilous
to
admit
of
his
render
any
assistance
to
the
ill
-
fate
waterman
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
,
indeed
,
that
he
behold
a
figure
spring
upon
the
starling
at
the
moment
when
the
boat
come
in
contact
;
but
,
as
he
could
perceive
no
one
near
him
,
he
conclude
he
must
have
be
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
make
Mr.
Wood
's
present
position
,
and
subsequent
proceeding
fully
intelligible
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
some
notion
of
the
shape
and
structure
of
the
platform
on
which
he
have
take
refuge
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
,
that
the
pier
of
each
arch
,
or
lock
of
Old
London
Bridge
,
be
defend
from
the
force
of
the
tide
by
a
huge
projecting
spur
call
a
starling
.
<EOS>
these
starling
vary
in
width
,
accord
to
the
bulk
of
the
pier
they
surround
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
all
pretty
nearly
of
the
same
length
,
and
build
somewhat
after
the
model
of
a
boat
,
have
extremity
as
sharp
and
point
as
the
keel
of
a
canoe
.
<EOS>
case
and
rib
with
stone
,
and
brace
with
horizontal
beam
of
timber
,
the
pile
,
which
form
the
foundation
of
these
jetty
,
have
resist
the
strong
encroachment
of
the
current
for
century
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
now
bury
at
the
bottom
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
the
starling
,
on
which
the
carpenter
stand
,
be
the
fourth
from
the
Surrey
shore
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
three
yard
in
width
,
and
a
few
more
in
length
;
but
it
be
cover
with
ooze
and
slime
,
and
the
wave
continually
break
over
it
.
<EOS>
the
transverse
spar
before
mention
be
as
slippery
as
ice
;
and
the
hollow
between
them
be
fill
ankle
-
deep
with
water
.
 
<EOS>
the
carpenter
throw
himself
flat
upon
the
starling
to
avoid
the
fury
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
posture
he
fare
worse
than
ever
.
<EOS>
if
he
run
less
risk
of
be
blow
over
,
he
stand
a
much
great
chance
of
be
wash
off
,
or
stifle
.
<EOS>
as
he
lie
on
his
back
,
he
fancy
himself
gradually
slip
off
the
platform
.
<EOS>
spring
to
his
foot
in
an
ecstasy
of
terror
,
he
stumble
,
and
have
well
nigh
realize
his
bad
apprehension
.
<EOS>
He
,
next
,
try
to
clamber
up
the
fly
buttress
and
soffit
of
the
pier
,
in
the
hope
of
reach
some
of
the
window
and
other
aperture
with
which
,
as
a
man
-
of
-
war
be
stud
with
port
-
hole
,
the
side
of
the
bridge
be
pierce
.
<EOS>
but
this
wild
scheme
be
speedily
abandon
;
and
,
nerve
by
despair
,
the
carpenter
resolve
to
hazard
an
attempt
,
from
the
execution
,
almost
from
the
contemplation
,
of
which
he

<EOS>
this
be
to
pass
under
the
arch
,
along
the
narrow
ledge
of
the
starling
,
and
,
if
possible
,
attain
the
eastern
platform
,
<EOS>
where
,
protect
by
the
bridge
,
he
would
suffer
less
from
the
excessive
violence
of
the
gale
.
 
<EOS>
Assured
,
if
he
remain
much
longer
where
he
be
,
he
would
inevitably
perish
,
Wood
recommend
himself
to
the
protection
of
Heaven
,
and
begin
his
perilous
course
.
<EOS>
carefully
sustain
the
child
which
,
even
in
that
terrible
extremity
,
he
have
not
the
heart
to
abandon
,
he
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
,
guide
himself
with
his
right
hand
,
creep
slowly
on
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
enter
the
arch
,
when
the
indraught
be
so
violent
,
and
the
noise
of
the
wind
so
dreadful
and
astounding
,
that
he
almost
determine
to
relinquish
the
undertaking
.
<EOS>
but
the
love
of
life
prevail
over
his
fear
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
ledge
,
along
which
he
crawl
,
be
about
a
foot
wide
.
<EOS>
in
length
the
arch
exceed
seventy
foot
.
<EOS>
to
the
poor
carpenter
it
seem
an
endless
distance
.
<EOS>
when
,
by
slow
and
toilsome
effort
,
he
have
arrive
midway
,
something
obstruct
his
further
progress
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
huge
stone
place
there
by
some
workman
occupy
in
repair
the
structure
.
<EOS>
cold
drop
stand
upon
Wood
's
brow
,
as
he
encounter
this
obstacle
.
<EOS>
to
return
be
<EOS>
impossible,--to
raise
himself
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
He
glance
downwards
at
the
impetuous
torrent
,
which
he
could
perceive
shooting
past
him
with
lightning
swiftness
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
He
listen
to
the
thunder
of
the
fall
now
mingle
with
the
roar
of
the
blast
;
and
,
drive
almost
frantic
by
what
he
hear
and
see
,
he
push
with
all
his
force
against
the
stone
.
<EOS>
to
his
astonishment
and
delight
it
yield
to
the
pressure
,
topple
over
the
ledge
,
and
sink
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
hubbub
and
tumult
around
him
,
that
the
carpenter
could
not
hear
its
plunge
into
the
flood
.
<EOS>
His
course
,
however
,
be
no
longer
interrupt
,
and
he
creep
on
.
 
<EOS>
after
encounter
other
danger
,
and
be
twice
,
compel
to
fle
himself
flat
upon
his
face
to
avoid
slip
from
the
wet
and
slimy
pathway
,
he
be
at
length
about
to
emerge
from
the
lock
,
when
,
to
his
inexpressible
horror
,
he
find
he
have
lose
the
child
!
 
<EOS>
all
the
blood
in
his
vein
rush
to
his
heart
,
and
he
shake
in
every
limb
as
he
make
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
a
specie
of
vertigo
seize
him
.
<EOS>
His
brain
reel
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
the
whole
fabric
of
the
bridge
be
crack
over
head,--that
the
arch
be
tumble
upon
him,--that
the
torrent
be
swell
around
him
,
whirl
him
off
,
and
about
to
bury
him
in
the
deafening
abyss
.
<EOS>
He
shriek
with
agony
,
and
cling
with
desperate
tenacity
to
the
roughen
stone
.
<EOS>
but
calm
thought
quickly
succeed
.
<EOS>
on
tax
his
recollection
,
the
whole
circumstance
rush
to
mind
with
painful
distinctness
.
<EOS>
He
remember
that
,
before
he
attempt
to
dislodge
the
stone
,
he
have
place
the
child
in
a
cavity
of
the
pier
,
which
the
granite
mass
have
be
intend
to
fill
.
<EOS>
this
obstacle
be
remove
,
in
his
eagerness
to
proceed
,
he
have
forget
to
take
his
little
charge
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
possible
the
child
may
be
in
safety
.
<EOS>
and
so
bitterly
do
the
carpenter
reproach
himself
with
his
neglect
,
that
he
resolve
,
at
all
risk
,
to
go
back
in
search
of
it
.
<EOS>
act
upon
this
humane
determination
,
he
impel
himself
slowly
<EOS>
backwards,--for
he
do
not
dare
to
face
the
blast,--and
with
incredible
labour
and
fatigue
reach
the
crevice
.
<EOS>
His
perseverance
be
amply
reward
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
still
safe
.
<EOS>
It
lie
undisturbed
in
the
remote
corner
of
the
recess
.
 
<EOS>
so
overjoyed
be
the
carpenter
with
the
successful
issue
of
his
undertaking
,
that
he
scarcely
pause
a
moment
to
recruit
himself
;
but
,
secure
the
child
,
set
out
upon
his
return
.
<EOS>
retrace
his
step
,
he
arrive
,
without
further
accident
,
at
the
eastern
platform
of
the
starling
.
<EOS>
as
he
anticipate
,
he
be
here
comparatively
screen
from
the
fury
of
the
wind
;
and
when
he
gaze
upon
the
roaring
fall
beneath
him
,
visible
through
the
darkness
in
a
glisten
sheet
of
foam
,
his
heart
overflow
with
gratitude
for
his
providential
deliverance
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
move
about
upon
the
starling
,
Mr.
Wood
become
sensible
that
he
be
not
alone
.
<EOS>
some
one
be
stand
beside
him
.
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
must
be
the
person
whom
he
have
see
spring
upon
the
western
platform
at
the
time
of
the
collision
between
the
boat
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
well
know
from
the
obstacle
which
have
interfere
with
his
own
progress
,
that
the
unknown
could
not
have
pass
through
the
same
lock
as
himself
.
<EOS>
but
he
may
have
creep
along
the
left
side
of
the
pier
,
and
beneath
the
further
arch
;
whereas
,
Wood
,
as
we
have
see
,
take
his
course
upon
the
right
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
prevent
the
carpenter
from
discern
the
feature
or
figure
of
the
stranger
;
and
the
ceaseless
din
preclude
the
possibility
of
hold
any
communication
by
word
with
him
.
<EOS>
wood
,
however
,
make
know
his
presence
to
the
individual
by
lay
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
start
at
the
touch
,
and
speak
.
<EOS>
but
his
word
be
bear
away
by
the
drive
wind
.
 
<EOS>
find
all
attempt
at
conversation
with
his
companion
in
misfortune
in
vain
,
wood
,
in
order
to
distract
his
thought
,
look
up
at
the
gigantic
structure
standing
,
like
a
wall
of
solid
darkness
,
before
him
.
<EOS>
what
be
his
transport
on
perceive
that
a
few
yard
above
him
a
light
be
burn
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
do
not
hesitate
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
handful
of
the
gravelly
mud
,
with
which
the
platform
be
cover
,
and
throw
the
small
pebble
,
one
by
one
,
towards
the
gleam
.
<EOS>
a
pane
of
glass
be
shiver
by
each
stone
.
<EOS>
the
signal
of
distress
be
evidently

.
<EOS>
the
light

.
<EOS>
the
window
be
shortly
after
open
,
and
a
rope
ladder
,
with
a
lighted
horn
lantern
attach
to
it
,
let
down
.
 
<EOS>
Wood
grasp
his
companion
's
arm
to
attract
his
attention
to
this
unexpected
mean
of
escape
.
<EOS>
the
ladder
be
now
within
reach
.
<EOS>
both
advanced
towards
it
,
when
,
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
,
Wood
beheld
,
in
the
countenance
of
the
stranger
,
the
well
-
remember
and
stern
feature
of
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
the
carpenter
tremble
;
for
he
perceive
Rowland
's
gaze
fix
first
upon
the
infant
,
and
then
on
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
shriek
Rowland
,
in
a
voice
hear
above
the
howling
of
the
temp
,
"

from
this
roar
abyss
to
torment
me

<EOS>
Its

<EOS>
and

their
wretched
offspring
live
to
blight
my
hope
,
and
blast
my
fame
?
<EOS>
never

"
<EOS>
and
,
with
these
word
,
he
grasp
Wood
by
the
throat
,
and
,
despite
his
resistance
,
drag
him
to
the
very
verge
of
the
platform
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
juncture
,
a
thundering
crash
be
hear
against
the
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
a
stack
of
chimney
,
on
the
house
above
them
,
have
yield
to
the
storm
,
and
descend
in
a
shower
of
brick
and
stone
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
carpenter
a
moment
afterwards
stretch
out
his
hand
,
scarcely
know
whether
he
be
alive
or
dead
,
he
find
himself
alone
.
<EOS>
the
fatal
shower
,
from
which
he
and
his
little
charge
escape
uninjured
,
have
stricken
his
assailant
and
precipitate
him
into
the
boil
gulf
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
ill
wind
that
blow
nobody
good

"
think
the
carpenter
,
turn
his
attention
to
the
child
,
whose
feeble
struggle
and
cry
proclaim
that
,
as
yet
,
life
have

by
the
hardship
it
have
undergo

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
poor

"
<EOS>
he
mutter
,
press
it
tenderly
to
his
breast
,
as
he
grasp
the
rope
and
clamber
up
to
the
window
:
"
if
thou
hast
,
indeed
,
lose
both
thy

as
that
terrible
man
say
just
now
,
thou
art
not
wholly
friendless
and
desert

for
I
myself
will
be
a

to
thee

<EOS>
and
in
memory
of
this
dreadful
night

and
the
death
from
which
I
have
,
be
the
mean
of

thee

"
 
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Wood
creep
through
the
window
,
than
nature
give
way
,
and
he
faint
.
<EOS>
on
come
to
himself
,
he
find
he
have
be
wrap
in
a
blanket
and
put
to
bed
with
a
couple
of
hot

<EOS>
His
first
inquiry
be
concern
the
child

and
he
be
delighted
to
find
that

<EOS>
every

about

into

<EOS>
with
great
difficulty

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
It
be
a

depressing
sight

<EOS>
one
Friday
afternoon
,
in

that
Mr.

who
have
be
absent
on

during

great

return
(
perhaps
not

at
an
early
hour

and
be
about

when

<EOS>

this

for
a
moment

<EOS>
but
find
all

,
he
cautiously

the
latch
,
and
creep
into
the

,
resolve
to

the

in
case

should

and
an
endless

against

<EOS>
over
these

the

<EOS>

thickly
strew

and
across
the
room

wide

next

<EOS>
on
the
bench

"
<EOS>
and
,
as
if
to
make
the
moral
more
obvious
,
a
dirty
pack

scatter

underneath

upon

<EOS>
near

behind
which
the
carpenter
ensconce
himself
in

to
reconnoitre

unobserved

the
proceeding
of
his
idle
apprentice

<EOS>

on

on

with
his

his
name
upon
a
beam
,
overhead
.
<EOS>
boy
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
be
attire
like
man
of
their
own
day
,
or
certain
charity
-
child
of
ours
;
and
the
stripling
in
question
be
dress
in
black
plush
breech
,
and
a
gray
drugget
waistcoat
,
with
immoderately
long
pocket
,
both
of
which
be
evidently
the
cast
-
off
clothe
of
some
one
considerably
his
senior
.
<EOS>
Coat
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
he
have
none
,
it
be
more
convenient
,
as
well
as
agreeable
to
him
,
to
pursue
his
avocation
in
his
shirtsleeve
;
but
,
when
fully
equipped
,
he
wear
a
large
-
cuffed
,
long
-
skirt
garment
,
which
have
once
be
the
property
of
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
in
conceal
himself
behind
the
timber
,
Mr.
Wood
could
not
avoid
make
a
slight
shuffling
sound
.
<EOS>
the
noise
startle
the
apprentice
,
who
instantly
suspend
his
labour
,
and
gaze
anxiously
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
he
suppose
it
proceed
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
that
of
a
quick
,
intelligent
-
look
boy
,
with
fine
hazel
eye
,
and
a
clear
olive
complexion
.
<EOS>
His
figure
be
uncommonly
slim
even
for
his
age
,
which
could
not
be
more
than
thirteen
;
and
the
looseness
of
his
garb
make
him
appear
thin
than
he
be
in
reality
.
<EOS>
but
if
his
frame
be
immature
,
his
look
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
possess
a
penetration
and
cunne
beyond
his
year
--
to
hide
a
man
's
judgment
under
a
boy
's
mask
.
<EOS>
the
glance
,
which
he
throw
at
the
door
,
be
singularly
expressive
of
his
character
:
it
be
a
mixture
of
alarm
,
effrontery
,
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
in
the
end
,
resolution
triumph
,
as
it
be
sure
to
do
,
over
the
weak
emotion
,
and
he
laugh
at
his
fear
.
<EOS>
the
only
part
of
his
otherwise
-
interesting
countenance
,
to
which
one
could
decidedly
object
,
be
the
mouth
;
a
feature
that
,
more
than
any
other
,
be
conceive
to
betray
the
animal
propensity
of
the
possessor
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
true
,
it
must
be
own
that
the
boy
's
mouth
show
a
strong
tendency
on
his
part
to
coarse
indulgence
.
<EOS>
the
eye
,
too
,
though
large
and
bright
,
and
shade
by
long
lash
,
seem
to
betoken
,
as
hazel
eye
generally
do
in
man
,
a
faithless
and
uncertain
disposition
.
<EOS>
the
cheek
-
bone
be
prominent
:
the
nose
slightly
depress
,
with
rather
wide
nostril
;
the
chin
narrow
,
but
well
-
form
;
the
forehead
broad
and
lofty
;
and
he
possess
such
an
extraordinary
flexibility
of
muscle
in
this
region
,
that
he
could
elevate
his
eye
-
brow
at
pleasure
up
to
the
very
verge
of
his
sleek
and
shine
black
hair
,
which
,
be
closely
crop
,
to
admit
of
his
occasionally
wear
a
wig
,
give
a
singular
bullet
-
shape
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
take
altogether
,
his
physiognomy
resemble
one
of
those
vagabond
head
which
Murillo
delight
to
paint
,
and
for
which
Guzman
d'Alfarache
,
Lazarillo
de
Tormes
,
or
Estevanillo
Gonzalez
may
have
sat:--face
that
almost
make
one
in
love
with
roguery
,
they
seem
so
full
of
vivacity
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
there
be
all
the
knavery
,
and
more
than
all
the
drollery
of
a
spanish
picaroon
in
the
laugh
eye
of
the
english
apprentice
;
and
,
with
a
little
more
warmth
and
sunniness
of
skin
on
the
side
of
the
latter
,
the
resemblance
between
them
would
have
be
complete
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
as
he
think
,
that
he
have
nothing
to
apprehend
<EOS>
,
the
boy
resume
his
task
,
chant
,
as
he
ply
his
knife
with
redouble
assiduity
,
the
following
--
not
inappropriate
strains:--

you

's
intention

you

you

the
scrutiny
of
Mrs.

be
pronounce
by
that
lady
to
be
very
much
sprain
;
and
she
,
forthwith
,
proceed
to
bathe
it
with
a
reddish
-
colour
lotion
.
<EOS>
during
this
operation
,
the
carpenter
undergo
a
severe
catechism
as
to
the
cause
of
the
accident
;
and
,
on
learn
that
the
mischance
originate
with
Jack
Sheppard
,

indignation
of
his
helpmate

no
bound

and
she
be
with
difficulty
prevent
from
fly
to
the
workshop
to
inflict
summary
punishment
on
the
offender
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
it
would
be
,
"
she
cry
,
in
the
shrill
voice
peculiar
to
a
shrew
,
"
when
you
bring
that
worthless
hussy
's
worthless
brat
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
no
good
would
come
of
it

<EOS>
and
every
day
's
experience
prove
that
I
be
right
.
<EOS>
but
,
like
all
your
overbearing
sex
,
you
must
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
be
guide
by
me
--
never
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
love
,
you
be
entirely
mistaken

"
return
the
carpenter
,
endeavour
to
deprecate
his
wife
's
rise
resentment
by
the
soft
look
,
and
the
meek
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
,
however
,
be
this
submission
from
produce
the
desire
effect
,
that
it
seem
only
to
lend
additional
fuel
to
her
displeasure
.
<EOS>
forget
her
occupation
in
her
anger
,
she
leave
off
bathe
Darrell
's
wrist
;
and
,
squeeze
his
arm
so
tightly
that
the
boy
wince
with
pain
,
she
clap
her
right
hand
upon
her
hip
,
and
turn
,
with
flashing
eye
and
an
inflame
countenance
,
towards
her
crest
-
fall
spouse

<EOS>
"
what
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
almost
choke
with
passion,--"_I

<EOS>
advise
you

yourself

all

<EOS>
You
will
tell
me
next
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
recommend
you
to
go
and
visit
his
mother
so
frequently
under
the
plea
of
charity
;
to
give
her
wine
,
and
provision
,
and
money
;
to
remove
her
from
the
only
fit
quarter
for
such
people
--
the
Mint
;

to
place
her
in
a
cottage
at
Willesden
,
of
which
you
must
needs
pay
the
rent
?
<EOS>
marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
charity
should
begin
at
home

<EOS>
a
discreet
husband
would
leave
the
dispensation

his
bounty

where

It

with

Mrs.

into
a

violently,--"what

she
add

with
a
relent
look

"
I
be
content
to
make
up
our
quarrel

<EOS>
but
you
must
promise
me
not

go
near

abandon
hussy
at
Willesden

be
jealous

you

even
of

unworthy

"
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
make
peace
on
any
term
,
Mr.
Wood
give
the
required
promise
,
though
he
could
not
help

that
if
either
of

have
cause
to

jealous
<EOS>
he

the
party

<EOS>
and
here
,
we
may
be
permit
to
offer
an
observation
upon
the
peculiar
and
unaccountable
influence
which
lady
of
a
shrewish
turn
so
frequently
exercise
over
--
we
can
scarcely
,
in
this
case
,
say
--
their
lord
and
master
;
an
influence
which
seem
not
merely
to
extend
to
the
will
of
the
husband
,
but
even
to
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
remember
to
have
meet
with
a
single
individual
,
report
to
be
under
petticoat
government
,
who
be
not
content
with
his
lot,--nay
,
who
so
far
from
repine
,
do
not
exult
in
his
servitude
;
and
we
see
no
way
of
account
for
this
apparently
inexplicable
conduct
--
for
which
,
among
other
phenomenon
of
married
life
,
various
reason
have
be
assign
,
though
none
entirely
satisfactory
to
us
--
except
upon
the
ground
that
these
domineering
dame
possess
some
charm
sufficiently
strong
to
counteract
the
irritate
effect
of
their
temper
;
some
secret
and
attractive
quality
of
which
the
world
at
large
be
in
ignorance
,
and
with
which
their
husband
alone
can
be
suppose
to
be
acquaint
.
<EOS>
an
influence
of
this
description
appear
to
be
exert
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
worthy
carpenter
be
restore
to
instant
good
humour
by
a
glance
from
his
helpmate
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
infliction
he
have
just
endure
,
he
would
have
quarrel
with
any
one
who
have
endeavour
to
persuade
him
that
he
be
not
the
happy
of
man
,
and
Mrs.
Wood
the
good
of
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
woman
must
have
their
will
while
they
live
,
since
they
can
make
none
when
they
die
,
"
observe
Wood
,
as
he
imprint
a
kiss
of
reconciliation
on
the
plump
hand
of
his
consort;--a
sentiment
to
the
correctness
of
which
the
party
chiefly
interested
graciously
vouchsafe
her
assent
.
 
<EOS>
lest
the
carpenter
should
be
tax
with
too
much
uxoriousness
,
it
behove
us
to
ascertain
whether
the
personal
attraction
of
his
helpmate
would
,
in
any
degree
,
justify
the
devotion
he
display
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Mrs.
Wood
have
the
advantage
of
her
husband
in
point
of
year
,
be
on
the
sunny
side
of
forty,--a
period
pronounce
by
competent
judge
to
be
the
most
fascinating
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
most
critical
epoch
of
woman
's
existence,--whereas
,
he
be
on
the
shady
side
of
fifty,--a
term
of
life
not
generally
conceive
to
have
any
special
recommendation
in
female
eye
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
she
really
have
some
pretension
to
beauty
.
<EOS>
account
extremely
pretty
in
her
youth
,
her
feature
and
person
expand
as
she
grow
old
,
without
much
detriment
to
their
original
comeliness
.
<EOS>
her
be
beauty
on
a
large
scale
no
doubt
;
but
it
be
beauty
,
nevertheless
:
and
the
carpenter
think
her
eye
as
bright
,
her
complexion
as
bloom
,
and
her
figure
(
if
a
little
more
buxom
)
quite
as
captivate
as
when
he
lead
her
to
the
altar
some
twenty
year
ago
.

on
the
present
occasion

in
anticipation
of
Mr.
Kneebone

visit

to
the
great
possible
advantage
,
the
rounded
proportion
of
her
figure
;
while
a
high

red

not
detract
from

neat
ankle

her
throat
,
and
a
few
black
patch

or
mouche
,
as
they

,
serve
as
a
foil
to
the
bloom
of
her
cheek
and
chin
.

upon
a

,
where
they

on
the
intelligence
of
Darrell

accident

a
pair
of
pink
kid

enormous

quarrel
with
any
one
,
Winny
;
much
less
with
a
person
whom
I
like
so
much
as
Jack
Sheppard

<EOS>
My

be
nearly
well
again

<EOS>
and
I
have
already
tell
you
the
accident
be
not
Jack

fault

<EOS>
so
,
let
's
think
no

about
it

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
<EOS>
you
should
like
Jack
so
much
dear
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
resemble
you
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
very
reason
why
I
like
him
,
Winny
.
<EOS>
if
he
_
do
_
resemble
me
,
I
should
not
care
about
him

<EOS>
and
,
whatever
you
may
think
,
I
assure
you
,
Jack
be
a
downright
good
-
natured
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
good
-
natured
fellow
be
always
especial
favourite
with

<EOS>
and
,
in
apply
the
term
to
his

Thames
mean
to
pay
him
a
high
compliment

<EOS>
and
so
winifre

him

<EOS>
"
well

she

in

"
I
may
have
do
Jack
an
injustice

I
will
try

better
of
him
in

"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
if
you
want
an
additional
inducement
to
do
so
,
I
can
tell
you
there
be
no
one
--
not
even
his

whom
he

I

anything
to

you

yet
more
deeply

"
it
be
not

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
then

to
change
it

gravely

you

as

this

in

mournful

firm
voice

the
tear

thickly

,
who
lose

leg
and
his
life
while
fight
for
James
the
Second
at
the
battle
of
the
Boyne
,
and
who
have
little
to
bequeath
his
son
except
his
laurel
and
his
loyalty
to
the
house
of
Stuart
.
 
<EOS>
the
gallant

He

and

which

he
may

respectable
member

<EOS>
of
late

his
plotting

It

memorable
rebellion
which

two
month
later

in
Scotland

<EOS>
since
the
accession
of
George
the
First
to
the
throne
in
the
precede
year

every
effort
have
be
make
by
the
partisan
of
the
Stuarts
to
shake
the
credit
of
the
exist
government
,
and
to
gain
supporter
to
their
cause

<EOS>
disappoint
in
their
hope
of
the
restoration
of
the
fall

after
the
death

the
Chevalier

<EOS>
no

<EOS>

<EOS>
arm

horse

and
accoutrement

and
it
be

if
the
unfortunate
prince
,
in
whose
behalf
these
exertion
be
make
,
and
who
be
not
deficient
in
courage
,
as
he
prove
at
the
battle
of
Malplaquet
,
have
boldly
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
party
at
an
early
period
,
he
may
have
regain
the
crown
of
his
ancestor

<EOS>
but
the
indecision

which
have
be
fatal
to
his
race
,
be
fatal
to
him

He

his
advantage

CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
and
his
Friends
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
be
scarcely
seat
before
Mr.
Kneebone
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
to
her
great
surprise
and
mortification
he
be
not
alone
;
but
bring
with
him
a
couple
of
friend
,
whom
he
beg
to
introduce
as
Mr.
Jeremiah
Jackson
,
and
Mr.
Solomon
Smith
,
chapmen
,
(
or
what
in
modern
vulgar
parlance
would
be
term
bagman
)
travel
to
procure
order
for
the
house
of
an
eminent
cloth
manufacturer
in
Manchester
.
<EOS>
neither
the
manner
,
the
look
,
nor
the
attire
of
these
gentleman
prepossess
Mrs.
Wood
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
on
their
presentation
,
Mr.
Jeremiah
Jackson
and
Mr.
Solomon
Smith
receive
something
very
like
a
rebuff
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
they
be
not
easily
discompose
.
<EOS>
two
person
possess
a
more
comfortable
stock
of
assurance
could
not
be
readily
find
.
<EOS>
imitate
the
example
of
Mr.
Kneebone
,
who
do
not
appear
in
the
slight
degree
disconcert
by
his
cool
reception
,
each
sink
carelessly
into
a
chair
,
and
make
himself
at
home
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
both
have
very
singular
face
;
very
odd
wig
,
very
much
pull
over
their
brow
;
and
very
large
cravat
,
very
much
raise
above
their
chin
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
each
have
a
large
black
patch
over
his
right
eye
,
and
a
very
queer
twist
at
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
,
so
that
if
their
object
have
be
disguise
,
they
could
not
have
adopt
well
precaution
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
think
them
both
remarkably
plain
,
but
Mr.
Smith
decidedly
the
plain
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
as
blue
as
a
sailor
's
jacket
,
and
though
Mr.
Jackson
have
one
of
the
ugliest
countenance
imaginable
,
he
have
a
very
fine
set
of
tooth
.
<EOS>
that
be
something
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
one
peculiarity
she
do
not
fail
to
notice
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
dress
in
every
respect
alike
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Mr.
Solomon
Smith
seem
to
be
Mr.
Jeremiah
Jackson
's
double
.
<EOS>
He
talk
in
the
same
style
,
and
pretty
nearly
in
the
same
language
;
laugh
in
the
same
manner
,
and
cough
,
or
sneeze
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Jackson
take
an
accurate
survey
of
the
room
with
his
one
eye
,
Mr.
Smith
's
solitary
orb
follow
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
when
Jeremiah
admire
the
Compasses
in
the
arm
of
the
Carpenter
's
Company
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
or
the
portrait
of
the
two
eminent
master
of
the
rule
and
plane
,
William
Portington
,
and
John
Scott
,
Esquires
,
on
either
side
of
it
,
Solomon
be
lose
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Jackson
notice
a
fine
service
of
old
blue
china
in
an
open
japan
closet
,
Mr.
Smith
have
never
see
anything
like
it
.
<EOS>
and
finally
,
when
Jeremiah
,
have
bestow
upon
Mrs.
Wood
a
very
free
-
and
-
easy
sort
of
stare
,
wink
at
Mr.
Kneebone
,
his
impertinence
be
copy
to
the
letter
by
Solomon
.
<EOS>
all
three
,
then
,
burst
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
's
astonishment
and
displeasure
momentarily
increase
.
<EOS>
such
freedom
from
such
people
be
not
to
be
endure
.
<EOS>
Her
patience
be
wane
fast
.
<EOS>
still
,
in
spite
of
her
glance
and
gesture
,
Mr.
Kneebone
make
no
effort
to
check
the
unreasonable
merriment
of
his
companion
,
but
rather
seem
to
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Wood
go
on
fuming
,
and
the
trio
go
on
laugh
for
some
minute
,
nobody
know
why
or
wherefore
,
until
the
party
be
increase
by
Mr.
Wood
,
in
his
Sunday
habiliment
and
Sunday
buckle
.
<EOS>
without
stop
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
their
mirth
,
or
even
to
ask
the
name
of
his
guest
,
the
worthy
carpenter
shake
hand
with
the
one
-
eyed
chapman
,
slap
Mr.
Kneebone
cordially
on
the
shoulder
,
and
begin
to
laugh
as
heartily
as
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
all

,
"
she
cry

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

"
add
Mr.

,
place
his
hand
on
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
and
Mr.
Wood
laugh
louder
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
,
"

the

<EOS>
I

which
be

to
speak

,
"
will
do
as

"
 
<EOS>
here
the

Mr.

in

<EOS>

"
They

<EOS>

Ladder

<EOS>
if
there
be
one
thing
on
earth
,
more
lovely

another

it
be
a
fair
girl
of
the
tender
age
of
Winifred

Her
beauty

feeling

that
of
admiration

the
charm
of
innocence

around

,
as
fragrance

diffuse
by
the
flower
,
sanctify
her
light
thought
and
action
,
and
shield
her
,
like
a
spell
,
from
the
approach
of
evil

<EOS>
beautiful
be
the
girl
of
twelve,--who
be
neither
child
nor
woman
,
but
something
between
both
,
something
more
exquisite
than
either
!
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
fairy
creature
present
to
Thames
Darrell
,
under
the
follow
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
escape
from
the
scene
of
recrimination
that
ensue
between
his
adopt
parent
,
Thames
seize
the
early
opportunity
of
retiring
,
and
take
his
way
to
a
small
chamber
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
where
he
and
Jack
be
accustomed
to
spend
most
of
their
leisure
in
the
amusement
,
or
pursuit
,
proper
to
their
year
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
door
ajar
,
and
,
to
his
surprise
,
perceive
little
winifred
seat
at
a
table
,
busily
engage
in
trace
some
design
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
hear
his
approach
,
but
continue
her
occupation
without
raise
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
charming
sight
to
watch
the
motion
of
her
tiny
finger
as
she
pursue
her
task
;
and
though
the
posture
she
adopt
be
not
the
most
favourable
that
may
have
be
choose
for
the
display
of
her
sylphlike
figure
,
there
be
something
in
her
attitude
,
and
the
glow
of
her
countenance
,
light
up
by
the
mellow
radiance
of
the
set
sun
fall
upon
her
through
the
pane
of
the
little
dormer

window
,
that
seem
to
the
youth
inexpressibly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Winifred

feature
would
have
be
pretty
,
for
they
be
regular
and
delicately

,
if
they
have
not
be
slightly
mark
by
the
small

pox;--a
disorder
,
that
sometimes
spare
more
than

destroy
,
and
impart
an
expression
to
be
seek
for
in
vain
in
the
smooth
complexion
.

We

Her
eye
be
soft
and
blue

arch
over
by
dark
brow
,
and
fringe
by
long
silken
lash

<EOS>
Her
hair
be
of
the
dark

certain
fullness
about

<EOS>
Her
slender
throat

a
black
riband

with

small
locket

upon

the
mark
of

brilliant
.

Thames
take
it
,

beheld
the
portrait
of
a
young
man

apparently
--
judge
from
his
attire

of
high
rank
,
whose
proud
and
patrician
feature
certainly
present
a
very
striking
resemblance
to
his

"
You
be
right
Jack

"
he
say
,
after
a
pause
,
during

he
contemplate

with
the
most
fix
attention
:

this
must
have
be
my
father

"
no

Sheppard

only
compare
it
with

you

CHAPTER
VII
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
and
Sister
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
same
evening
,
in
a
stately
chamber
of
a
noble
old
mansion
of
Elizabeth
's
time
,
situate
in
Southampton
Fields
,
two
person
be
seat
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
,
a
lady
,
evidently
a
confirm
invalid
,
and
attire
in
deep
mourning
,
recline
upon
a
sort
of
couch
,
or
easy
chair
,
set
on
wheel
,
with
her
head
support
by
cushion
,
and
her
foot
rest
upon
a
velvet
footstool
.
<EOS>
a
crutch
,
with
a
silver
handle
,
stand
by
her
side
,
prove
the
state
of
extreme
debility
to
which
she
be
reduce
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
easy
matter
to
determine
her
age
,
for
,
though
she
still
retain
a
certain
youthfulness
of
appearance
,
she
have
many
mark
in
her
countenance
,
usually
indicate
the
decline
of
life
,
but
which
in
her
case
be
,
no
doubt
,
the
result
of
constant
and
severe
indisposition
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
wan
and
fade
,
except
where
it
be
tinge
by
a
slight
hectic
flush
,
that
make
the
want
of
colour
more
palpable
;
her
eye
be
large
and
black
,
but
heavy
and
lustreless
;
her
cheek
sink
;
her
frame
emaciate
;
her
dark
hair
thickly
scatter
with
gray
.
<EOS>
when
young
,
and
in
well
health
,
she
must
have
be
eminently
lovely
;
and
there
be
still
the
remain
of
great
beauty
about
her
.
<EOS>
the
expression
,
however
,
which
would
chiefly
have
interest
a
beholder
,
be
that
of
settled
and
profound
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
companion
be
a
person
of
no
inferior
condition
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
apparent
,
from
the
likeness
between
them
,
that
they
be
nearly
relate
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
same
dark
eye
,
though
light
by
a
fierce
flame
;
the
same
sallow
complexion
;
the
same

His
pride

would

convenient

dutch
sloop

by
mean
of
which
I
can
transmit
any
light
ware,--such

<EOS>
Mrs.

's
dress

extremely
neat

clean

simply
fashioned

and
of
the
plain
and
most
unpretending
material,--offered
nothing
assailable
;
and
her
demeanour
be
so
humble

her

so
modest

she

<EOS>
as
the
lapse

change

work

alteration

it
may
not
be
improper
to
notice
it
here
.
<EOS>
when
first
bring
under
consideration
,
she
be
a
miserable
and
forlorn
object
;
squalid
in
attire
,
haggard
in
look
,
and
emaciate
in
frame
.
<EOS>
now
,
she
be
the
very
reverse
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
,
it
have
just
be
say
,
be
neatness

simplicity
itself
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
,
though
slight
,
have
all
the
fulness
of
health
;
and
her
complexion
--
still
pale
,
but
without
its
former
sickly
cast,--contrasted
agreeably
,
by
its
extreme
fairness
,
with
the
dark
brow
and
dark
lash
that
shade
eye
which
,
if
they
have
lose
some
of
their
original
brilliancy
,
have
gain
infinitely
more
in
the
soft
and
chasten
lustre
that
replace
it

<EOS>
one
marked
difference
between
the
poor
outcast
,
who
,
oppress
by
poverty

and
sting
by
shame
,
have
seek
temporary
relief
in
the
stupifying
draught,--that
bad
"
medicine
of
a
mind
diseased,"--and
those
of
the
same
being
,
free
from
her
vice
,
and
restore
to
comfort
and
contentment
,
if
not
to
happiness

by
a
more
prosperous
course
of
event

in
the

<EOS>
for
the
fresh
and
feverish
hue
of
lip
which
year

this
feature

be
now
substitute
a
pure
and
wholesome
bloom

evince
a
total
change
of
habit

,
though
the
coarse
character
of
the
mouth
remain

in

degree

unaltered

it

so
modify

<EOS>
what
be
yet
more
worthy
of
note
be
,
that
the
widow

countenance

an
air
of
refinement
about
it

of
which
it
be
utterly
destitute
before

along
Drury

in
Kendrick

<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
round

house
,
Terry

<EOS>
such
be
the
terror

by
Wild

vindictive
character
,
that
few
durst
face
him
who
have
give
him
cause
for
displeasure

<EOS>
aware
that
he
should
incur
the
thief
-
taker
's
bitter
animosity
by
what
he
have
do
,
the
watchman
,
whose
wrath
against
Quilt
Arnold
have
evaporate
during
the
walk
,
think
it
more
prudent
not
to
hazard
a
meeting
with
his
master
,
till
the
storm
have
,
in
some
measure
,
blow
over
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
have
give
Wood
such
direction
as
he
think
necessary
for
his
guidance
,
and
receive
a
handsome
gratuity
in
return
for
his
service
,
he
depart
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
considerable
demur
and
delay
on
the
part
of
Sharples
that
the
carpenter
and
his
companion
could
gain
admittance
to
the
round
-
house
.
<EOS>
reconnoitre
them
through
a
small
grate
loophole
,
he
refuse
to
open
the
door
till
they
have
explain
their
business
.
<EOS>
this
,
Wood
,
act
upon
Terry
's
caution
,
be
most
unwilling
to
do
;
but
,
find
he
have
no
alternative
,
he
reluctantly
make
know
his
errand
and
the
bolt
be
undrawn
.
<EOS>
once
in
,
the
constable
's
manner
appear
totally
change
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
as
civil
as
he
have
just
be
insolent
.
<EOS>
apologize
for
their
detention
,
he
answer
the
question
put
to
him
respect
the
boy
,
by
positively
deny
that
any
such
prisoner
have
be
entrust
to
his
charge
,
but
offer
to
conduct
him
to
every
cell
in
the
building
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
assertion
.
<EOS>
He
then
bar
and
double
-
lock
the
door
,
take
out
the
key
,
(
a
precautionary
measure
which
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
he
say
he
never
omit
,
)
thrust
it
into
his
vest
,
and
motion
the
couple
to
follow
him
,
lead
the
way
to
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
as
Wood
obey
,
his
foot
slip
;
and
,
cast
his
eye
upon
the
floor
,
he
perceive
it
splash
in
several
place
with
blood
.
<EOS>
from
the
freshness
of
the
stain
,
which
grow
more
frequent
as
they
approach
the
adjoining
chamber
,
it
be
evident
some
violence
have
be
recently
perpetrate
,
and
the
carpenter
's
own
blood
freeze
within
his
vein
as
he
think
,
with
a
thrill
of
horror
,
that
,
perhaps
on
this
very
spot
,
not
many
minute
before
his
arrival
,
his
adopt
son
may
have
be
inhumanly
butcher
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
impression
remove
as
he
steal
a
glance
at
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
and
see
from
her
terrified
look
that
she
have
make
the
same
alarming
discovery
as
himself
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
now
too
late
to
turn
back
,
and
,
nerve
himself
for
the
shock
he
expect
to
encounter
,
he
venture
after
his
conductor
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
they
enter
the
room
than
Sharples
,
who
wait
to
usher
them
in
,
hastily
retreat
,
close
the
door
,
and
turn
the
key
,
laugh
loudly
at
the
success
of
his
stratagem
.
<EOS>
vexation
at
his
folly
in
suffer
himself
to
be
thus
entrap
keep
Wood
for
a
short
time
silent
.
<EOS>
when
he
could
find
word
,
he
try
by
the
most
urgent
solicitation
to
prevail
upon
the
constable
to
let
him
out
.
<EOS>
but
threat
and
entreaty
--
even
promise
be
ineffectual
;
and
the
unlucky
captive
,
after
exhaust
his
power
of
persuasion
,
be
compel
to
give
up
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
he
be
detain
--
that
lately
occupy
by
the
Mohocks
,
who
,
it
appear
,
have
be
allow
to
depart,--was
calculate
to
inspire
additional
apprehension
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
strongly
impregnate
with
the
mingled
odour
of
tobacco
,
ale
,
brandy
,
and
other
liquor
,
the
atmosphere
be
almost
stifle
.
<EOS>
the
bench
run
round
the
room
,
though
fasten
to
the
wall
by
iron
clamp
,
have
be
forcibly
wrench
off
;
while
the
table
,
which
be
similarly
secure
to
the
board
,
be
upset
,
and
its
content
--
bottle
,
jug
,
glass
,
and
bowl
be
break
and
scatter
about
in
all
direction
.
<EOS>
everything
proclaim
the
mischievous
propensity
of
the
recent
occupant
of
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
here
lie
a
heap
of
knocker
of
all
size
,
from
the
huge
lion
's
head
to
the
small
brass
rapper
:
there
,
a
collection
of
sign
-
board
,
with
the
name
and
calling
of
the
owner
utterly
obliterate
.
<EOS>
on
this
side
stand
the
instrument
with
which
the
latter
piece
of
pleasantry
have
be
effected,--namely
,
a
bucket
fill
with
paint
and
a
brush
:
on
that
be
erect
a
trophy
,

of
a
watchman

rattle
,
a
laced
hat
,
with
the
crown

and
its
place

by
a
lantern
,
a
campaign
wig
saturate
with
punch
,
a
torn
steen
-
kirk
and
ruffles
,
some
half
-
dozen
stave
,
and
a
broken
sword
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
carpenter
's
gaze
wander
over
this
scene
of
devastation
,
his
attention
be
draw
by
Mrs.
Sheppard
towards
an
appalling
object
in
one
corner
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
body
of
a
man
,
apparently
lifeless
,
and
stretch
upon
a
mattress
,
with
his
head
bind
up
in
a
linen
cloth

through
which

,
quietly

,
and
bestow
no

of

upon
the
new

<EOS>
Their
conversation

in
the
flash
language
,
and
,
though
unintelligible
to
Wood
,
be
easily
comprehend
by
this
companion
,
who
learn
,
to
her
dismay
,
that
the
wounded
man
have
receive
his
hurt
from
her
son
,
whose
courage
and
dexterity
form
the
present
subject
of
their
discourse

<EOS>
from
other
obscure
hint

by
the
speaker

Mrs.

him
almost
frantic

<EOS>
He
renew
his
supplication
to
Sharples
,
but
with
no
well
success
than
heretofore
;
and
the
great
part
of
the
night

him
and
the
poor
widow

anxiety

if
possible

most
miserable
state
imaginable

at

about
three
o'clock
,
as
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn

visible
through
the
bar
casement
of
the
round

rattling
of

outer
door

about
three
hour
before

and
have
proceed
to
the
Cross
Shovels
.
<EOS>
this
be
enough
for
the
poor
widow
.
<EOS>
She
feel
she
be
now
near
her
boy
,
and
,
nothing
doubt
her
ability
to
rescue
him
from
his
perilous
situation
,
she
breathe
a
fervent
prayer
for
his
deliverance
;
and
bend
her
step
towards
the
tavern
in
question
,
revolve
within
her
mind
as
she
walk
along
the
good
mean
of
accomplish
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
aware
of
the
cunning
and
desperate
character
of
the
person
with
whom
she
would
have
to
deal,--aware
,
also
,
that
she
be
in
a
quarter
where
no
law
could
be
appeal
to
,
nor
assistance

she
feel
the
absolute
necessity
of
caution

<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
she

at
the
Shovels
,
with
which
,
as
an
old
haunt
in
her
bygone
day
of
wretchedness
she

on

,
and

as
an
excuse
for
so

call
for
something
to
drink
.
<EOS>
the
drawer
at
the
moment
be
too
busy
to
attend
to
her

and
she
would
have
seize
the
opportunity
of
examine
,
unperceived
,
the
assemblage
within
,
through
a
little
curtained
window
that
overlook
the
adjoining
chamber
,
if

the

and
the
Satrap
of

by
accident
at
the
Cross
Shovels
.
<EOS>
a
jolly
night
we
make
of
it
,
as
you
may
suppose
;
for
four
such
monarchs

not

unconstitutional

William

for
I
may
remark
that

I
repeat

it

be
all

arbitrary

proud
to

<EOS>
I
hope
to
see
the
day
,
when
not
Southwark

but
London
itself
shall
become
one
mint,--when
all
man
shall
be
debtor

and
none
creditors,--when
imprisonment
for
debt
shall
be
utterly
abolished,--when
highway

robbery
shall
be
account
a
pleasant
pastime

and
<EOS>
forgery
an
accomplishment,--when
Tyburn

its
gibbet
shall
be
overthrown,--capital
punishment
discontinued,--Newgate

Ludgate

the
Gatehouse
,
and
the
Compters

,
in

as
that

may
possibly

I

we

before

I

loud
applause

as

down

the
cheer

<EOS>
Her
eye
wander
quickly
over
that
riotous

disorderly
assemblage

until
it
settle
upon
one
group
more
riotous
and
disorderly
than
the
rest

of
which
her
son
form
the
principal
figure

<EOS>
the
agonize
mother
could
scarcely
repress
a
scream
at
the
spectacle
that
meet
her
gaze

<EOS>
there
sit
Jack

evidently
in
the
last
stage
of
intoxication
,
with
his
collar
open

his
dress
disarrange

a
pipe
in
his
mouth

a
bowl
of
punch

a
half

empty
rummer
before
him,--there
<EOS>
he
sit
,
receive
and
return

or
rather
attempt
to
return,--for
<EOS>
he
be
almost
past
consciousness,--the
blandishment
of
a
couple
of
female
,
one
of
whom
have
pass
her
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
while
the
other
lean
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
appear
from
her
gesture
to
be
whisper
soft
nonsense
into
his
ear

<EOS>
both
these
lady
possess
considerable
personal
attraction

<EOS>
the
young
of
the
two
,
who
be

next

Jack

and
seem
to
monopolize
his

could
not

She

pearly
whiteness

a
brilliant
complexion

set
off
by
rich
auburn
hair

a
very
white
neck

latter
,
perhaps
,
a
trifle
too
much
expose

<EOS>
the

of
this
damsel

Edgeworth
Bess

,
as
her

not

perhaps
,
be
find
to

without
some
influence
upon
the

fortune
of

she
be

by

some

an
interest

of

rather

alleviate
her
misery,--namely
,
that
Jonathan

but
the
thought
of
the
reception

be
likely
to
meet
with
from
his

deter
her
from

this
resolution

and

out
homeward

<EOS>
It
be
a
long
walk
she
have
to
undertake
,
even
if
she
have
endure
no
previous
fatigue
,
but
feeble
as
she
be
,
it
be
almost
more
than
she
could
accomplish
.
<EOS>
Daybreak
find
her
wind
her
painful
way
along
the
Harrow
Road
;
and
,
in
order
to
shorten
the
distance
as
much
as
possible
,
she
take
the
near
cut
,
and
strike
into
the
meadow
on
the

<EOS>
cross
several

or

with
line
of

not
without
great

at

upon
a
heap
of

into
a
deep
and
refreshing
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
awake
,
the
sun
be
high
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bright
and
beautiful
day
:
_
so
<EOS>
_
bright
,
so
beautiful
,
that
even
her
sad
heart
be
cheer
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
air
,
perfume
with
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
new
-
mown
grass
,
be
vocal
with
the
melody
of
the
bird
;
the
thick
foliage
of
the
tree
be
glisten
in
the
sunshine
;
all
nature
seem
happy
and
rejoice
;
but
,
above
all
,
the
serene
Sabbath
stillness
reign
around
communicate
a
calm
to
her
wounded
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
contrast
do
the
lovely
scene
she
now
gaze
upon
present
to
the
squalid
neighbourhood
she
have
recently
quit
!
<EOS>
on
all
side
,
expand
prospect
of
country
the
most
exquisite
and
most
varied
.
<EOS>
immediately
beneath
her
lay
Willesden,--the
most
charming
and
secluded
village
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
--
with
its
scatter
farm
-
house
,
its
noble
grange
,
and
its
old
grey
church
-
tower
just
peep
above
a
grove
of
rook
-
haunt
tree
.
 
<EOS>
towards
this
spot
Mrs.
Sheppard
now
direct
her
step
.
<EOS>
She
speedily
reach
her
own
abode,--a
little
cottage
,
stand
in
the
outskirt
of
the
village
.
<EOS>
the
first
circumstance
that
strike
her
on
her
arrival
seem
ominous
.
<EOS>
Her
clock
have
stop
--
stop
at
the
very
hour
on
which
she
have
quit
the
Mint
!
<EOS>
She
have
not
the
heart
to
wind
it
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
after
partake
of
some
little
refreshment
,
and
change
her
attire
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
prepare
for
church
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
she
have
so
far
succeed
in
calm
herself
,
that
she
answer
the
greeting
of
the
neighbour
whom
she
encounter
on
her
way
to
the
sacred
edifice
--
if
sorrowfully
,
still
composedly
.
 
<EOS>
every
old
country
church
be
beautiful
,
but
Willesden
be
the
most
beautiful
country
church
we
know
;
and
in
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
time
it
be
even
more
beautiful
than
at
present
,
when
the
hand
of
improvement
have
proceed
a
little
too
rashly
with
alteration
and
repair
.
<EOS>
with
one
or
two
exception
,
there
be
no
pews
;
and
,
as
the
intercourse
with
London
be
then
but
slight
,
the
seat
be
occupy
almost
exclusively
by
the
villager
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
seat
,
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
farthest
remove
from
the
chancel
,
the
widow
take
her
place
,
and
address
herself
fervently
to
her
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
the
service
have
not
proceed
far
,
when
she
be
greatly
disturb
by
the
entrance
of
a
person
who
place
himself
opposite
her
,
and
seek
to
attract
her
attention
by
a
number
of
little
art
,
survey
her
,
as
he
do
so
,
with
a
very
impudent
and
offensive
stare
.
<EOS>
with
this
person
--
who
be
no
other
than
Mr.
Kneebone
--
she
be
too
well
acquainted
;
have
,
more
than
once
,
be
oblige
to
repel
his
advance
;
and
,
though
his
impertinence
would
have
give
her
little
concern
at
another
season
,
it
now
add
considerably
to
her
distraction
.
<EOS>
but
a
far
great
affliction
be
in
store
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
the
clergyman
approach
the
altar
,
she
perceive
a
boy
steal
quickly
into
the
church
,
and
ensconce
himself
behind
the
woollen
-
draper
,
<EOS>
who
,
in
order
to
carry
on
his
amatory
pursuit
with
great
convenience
,
and
at
the
same
time
display
his
figure
(
of
which
he
be
not
a
little
vain
)
to
the
utmost
advantage
,
prefer
a
standing
to
a
sit
posture
.
<EOS>
of
this
boy
she
have
only
catch
a
glimpse;--but
that
glimpse
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
her
<EOS>
it
be
her
son,--and
,
if
she
could
have
question
her
own
instinctive
love
,
she
could
not
question
her
antipathy
,
when
she
behold
,
partly
conceal
by
a
pillar
immediately
in
the
rear
of
the
woollen
-
draper
,
the
dark
figure
and
truculent
feature
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
as
she
look
in
this
direction
,
the
thief
-
taker
raise
his
eye
--
those
gray
,
blood
-
thirsty
eyes!--their
glare
freeze
the
life
-
blood
in
her
vein
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
avert
her
gaze
,
a
terrible
idea
cross
her
.
<EOS>
why
be
he
there
?
<EOS>
why
do
the
tempter
dare
to
invade
that
sacred
spot
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
answer
her
own
question
,
but
vague
fearful
suspicion
pass
through
her
mind
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
service
proceed
;
and
the
awful
command
,
"
_
Thou
shalt
not
steal
_
!
"
<EOS>
be
solemnly
utter
by
the
preacher
,
when
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
have
again
look
round
towards
her
son
,
beheld
a
hand
glance
along
the
side
of
the
woollen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
see
what
occur
,
though
she
guess
it
;
but
she
see
Jonathan
's
devilish
triumphing
glance
,
and
read
in
it,--"Your
son
have
commit
a
robbery
--
here
--
in
these
holy
wall
--
he
be
mine
--
mine
for
ever
!

She
utter
a
loud
scream
,
and

CHAPTER

Jonathan

House
in

<EOS>
just
as
St.
Sepulchre

one
,
on
the
eventful
night
of
the
10th
of
June
,
(
to
which
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
recur
,
)

horseman
,

on
a
powerful
charger
,
and
follow
at
a
respectful
distance
by
an
attendant
,
gallop
into
the
open
space
front
Newgate
,
and
direct
his
course
towards
a
house
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
before
he
could
draw
in
the
rein
,
his
steed
--
startle
apparently
by
some
object
undistinguishable
by
the
rider,--swerved
with
such
suddenness
as
to
unseat
him
,
and
precipitate
him
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
however
,
he
be
pick
up
,
and
set
upon
his
foot
by
a
person
who
,
have
witness
the
accident
,
fly
across
the
road
to
his
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

the
bridle
of
his
steed
,
who
continue
snorting
and
shivering
,
as
if
still
under
the
influence
of
some
unaccountable
alarm
;
"
what
can
ail
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"

this
world

"
 
<EOS>
"
most
likely
,
"
observe
Jonathan
,
with
a
slight
sneer
;
"
the
ghost
of
some
highwayman
who

Newgate

through
a
hundred
danger

<EOS>
"
if
the

unlucky
spot

what

Sir
?
"
ask
Trenchard

"
a
fall
against
Newgate

a
sign
of
death

the
halter

reply
Wild
,
with
ill

disguise
malignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tush
!
"
exclaim
Sir
Rowland
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
that
door

It

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

most
incredulous

drily

<EOS>
"
I
have
know
several
case
where
the
ignominious
doom
I
have
mention
have
be
foretold
by
such
an
accident
as

just

<EOS>
there
be
Major

you

recollect
him

Sir

Sir

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
so
?

"
ask
the
other
,
distrustfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall

return
Jonathan

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
the
help
of
his
comrade
,
Jack

,
the
young
rascal
make
a
bold
push
to
get
out
of
the
round
-
house
,
where
my
janizarie
have
lodge
him
,
and
would
have
succeed
too
,
if
,
by
<EOS>
good
luck,--for
<EOS>
the
devil
never
desert
so
useful
an
agent
as
I
be
,
Sir
Rowland,--I
have
not
arrive
in
time
to
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
my
old
and
trusty
setter
,
Abraham
Mendez
,
receive
a
blow
on
the
head
from
one
of
the
lad
that
will
deprive
me
of
his
service
for
a
week
to
come,--if
,
indeed
it
do
not
disable
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
I
have
lose
one
servant
,
I
have
gain
another
,
that
be
one
comfort
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
be
now
wholly
in
my
hand

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
to
me
,
Sir

"
say
Trenchard
,
cut
him
short
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
whatever
,
"
rejoin
the
thief
-
taker
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
much
to
me
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
be
to
me
what
Thames
Darrell
be
to
you
--
an
object
of
hatred
.
<EOS>
I
owe
his
father
a
grudge
:
that
I
settle
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
owe
his
mother
one
,
and
will
repay
the
debt
,
with
interest
,
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
away
with
him
at
once
,
as
you
be
about
to
make
away
with
your
nephew
,
Sir
Rowland,--but
that
would
not
serve
my
turn
.
<EOS>
to
be
complete
,
my
vengeance
must
be
tardy
.
<EOS>
certain
of
my
prey
,
I
can
afford
to
wait
for
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
revenge
be
sweeten
by
delay
;
and
I
indulge
too
freely
in
the
passion
to
rob
it
of
any
of
its
z
.
<EOS>
I
have
watch
this
lad
--
this
Sheppard
--
from
infancy
;
and
,
though
I
have
apparently
concern
myself
little
about
him
,
I
have
never
lose
sight
of
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
him
to
be
bring
up
decently
--
honestly
;
because
I
would
make
his
fall
the
great
,
and
deepen
the
wound
I
mean
to
inflict
upon
his
mother

<EOS>
from
this
night
I
shall
pursue
a

<EOS>
He

those
who
will
not
leave
the
task
assign
to
them
--
the
utter
perversion
of
his
principle
--
half
-
finished

<EOS>
and
when
I
have
steep
him
to
the
lip
in
vice
and
depravity

when
I
have
lead
him
to
the
commission

every
crime

neither

for
him

plunder
his

break
the
heart
of

then

not

then

consign
him

the
fate

a

You
need
have
no
apprehension
about
him
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
He
be
safe
enough
now

<EOS>
I
leave
him
in
charge
of
Quilt
Arnold

Rykhart
Van
Galgebrok
--
the
skipper
I
speak
of
--
with
strict
order
to
shoot
him

any

attempt
at
escape

and
they
be
not
lad

the
latter
especially
--
to
be
trifle
with

<EOS>
I
deem
it
more
prudent
to
send
him
to
the
Dark
House
than
to
bring
him
here
,
in
case
of
any
search
after
him

Wood

you

him

,
perhaps
,
you
will
first
accompany
me
to
my

that
we

arrange

<EOS>
I
have
a

<EOS>
the
thief

taker

residence
be
a

dismal

looking

habitation
,
separate
from

street
by
a
flagged
court

yard

and
defend
from

approach

an
iron
railing

<EOS>
even
in
the
daylight

it
have
a
sombre
and
suspicious
air

and
seem
to
slink
back
from
the
adjoining
house
,
as
if
afraid
of
their
society
.
<EOS>
in
the
obscurity
in
which
it
be
now
see
,
it
look
like
a
prison
,
and
,
indeed
,
it
be
Jonathan
's
fancy
to
make
it
resemble
one
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
window
be
grate
<EOS>
,
the
door
bar
;
each
room
have
the
name
as
well
as
the
appearance
of
a
cell
;
and
the
very
porter
who
stand
at
the
gate

habit
like
a
jailer
,
with
his
huge
bunch
of
key
at
his
girdle
,
his
forbid
countenance
and
surly
demeanour
seem
to
be
borrow
from
Newgate
.
<EOS>
the
clanking
of
chain
,
the
grating
of
lock
,
and
the
rumbling
of
bolt
must
have
be
music
in
Jonathan
's
ear

so
much
pain
do
he
take
to
subject
himself
to
such
sound

the

devoid

and
,
except
in

's
own
audience
-
chamber
,
there
be
not
a

great
stone
staircase

no

impress
the

the

in

the

so
cleverly

that
it

<EOS>
scarcely
any
one
enter
Mr.

's
dwelling
without
apprehension
,
or
quit
it
without
satisfaction

<EOS>
more
strange
story
be
tell
of
it
than
of
any
other
house
in
London

<EOS>
the
garret
be
say
to
be
tenant

the
cellar

<EOS>
by
some
it

affirm

the

by

where
such
malefactor
as
he
choose
to
screen
from
justice
may
lie
conceal
till
the
danger
be
blow
over
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
in
short
,
be
too
extravagant
to
be
relate
of
it
;
and
Jonathan
,
who
delight
in
invest
himself
and
his
residence
with
mystery
,
encourage
,
and
perhaps
originated
,
these
marvellous
tale
.
<EOS>
however
this
may
be
,
such
be
the
ill
report
of
the
place
that
few
pass
along
the
Old
Bailey
without
bestow
a
glance
of
fearful
curiosity
at
its
dingy
wall
,
and
wonder
what
be
go
on
inside
them
;
while
few
still
,
of
those
who
pause
at
the
door
,
read
,
without
some
internal
trepidation
,
the
formidable
name
--
inscribe
in
large
letter

bright
brass

of
JONATHAN
WILD

<EOS>
arrive
at
his
habitation

Jonathan
knock
in
a
peculiar
manner
at
the
door

which
be
instantly
open
by
the
grim
-
visaged
porter
just
allude
to
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Trenchard
cross
the
threshold
than
a
fierce
barking
be
hear
at
the
farth
extremity
of
the
passage
,
and
,
the
next
moment
,
a
couple
of
mastiff
of
the
large
size
rush
furiously
towards
him
.
<EOS>
the
knight
stand
upon
his
defence
;
but
he
would
unquestionably
have
be
tear
in
piece
by
the
savage
hound
,
if
a
shower
of
oath
,
second
by
a
vigorous
application
of
kick
and
blow
from
their
master
,
have
not
drive
them
growl
off
.
<EOS>
apologize
to
Sir
Rowland
for
this
unpleasant
reception
,
and
swear
lustily
at
his
servant
for
occasion
it
by
leave
the
dog
at
liberty
,
Jonathan
order
the
man
to
light
them
to
the
audience
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
command
be
sullenly
obey
,
for
the
fellow
do
not
appear
to
relish
the
rating
.
<EOS>
ascend
the
stair
,
and
conduct
them
along
a
sombre
gallery
,
in
which
Trenchard
notice
that
every
door
be
paint
black
,
and
number
,
he
stop
at
the
entrance
of
a
chamber
;
and
,
select
a
key
from
the
bunch
at
his
girdle
,
unlock
it
.
<EOS>
follow
his
guide
,
Sir
Rowland
find
himself
in
a
large
and
lofty
apartment
,
the
extent
of
which
he
could
not
entirely
discern
until
light
be
set
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
then
look
around
him
with
some
curiosity
;
and
,
as
the
thief
-
taker
be
occupy
in
give
direction
to
his
attendant
in
an
undertone
,
ample
leisure
be
allow
him
for
investigation
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
glance
,
he
imagine
he
must
have
stumble
upon
a
museum
of
rarity
,
there
be
so
many
glass
-
case
,
so
many
open
cabinet
,
range
against
the
wall
;
but
the
next
convince
him
that
if
Jonathan
be
a
virtuoso
,
his
taste
do
not
run
in
the
ordinary
channel
.
<EOS>
Trenchard
be
tempt
to
examine
the
content
of
some
of
these
case
,
but
a
close
inspection
make
him
recoil
from
them
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
in
the
one
he
approach
be
gather
together
a
vast
assortment
of
weapon
,
each
of
which
,
as
appear
from
the
ticket
attach
to
it
,
have
be
use
as
an
instrument
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
on
this
side
be
a
razor
with
which
a
son
have
murder
his
father
;
the
blade
notch
,
the
haft
crust
with
blood
:
on
that
,
a
bar
of
iron
,
bent
,
and
partly
break
,
with
which
a
husband
have
beat
out
his
wife
's
brain
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
not
,
however
,
our
intention
to
furnish
a
complete
catalogue
of
these
curiosity
,
we
shall
merely
mention
that
in
front
of
them
lie
a
large
and
sharp
knife
,
once
the
property
of
the
public
executioner
,
and
use
by
him
to
dissever
the
limb
of
those
condemn
to
death
for
high
-
treason
;
together
with
an
immense
two

pronged
flesh
-
fork
,
likewise
employ
by
the

terrible
functionary
to
plunge
the
quarter
of
his
victim
in
the
caldron
of
boil

at
Tyburn
and
Hounslow

to
have

of
its
charnel

to
enrich
the

so
well

,
each
of
which
have
fulfil
its
destiny
,
form
the
attraction
of
the
next
compartment
;
while
a
fourth
be
occupy
by
an
array
of
implement
of
housebreak
almost
innumerable
,
and
utterly
indescribable
.
<EOS>
all
these
interesting
object
be
carefully
arrange
,
class
,
and
,
as
we
have
say
,
label
by
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
from
this
singular
collection
Trenchard
turn
to
regard
its
possessor
,
who
be
stand
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
still
engage
in
earnest
discourse
with
his
attendant
,
and
,
as
he
contemplate
his
ruthless
countenance
,
on
which
duplicity
and
malignity
have
set
their
strong
seal
,
he
could
not
help
call
to
mind
all
he
have
hear
of
Jonathan
's
perfidiousness
to
his
employer
,
and
deeply
regret
that
he
have
place
himself
in
the
power
of
so
unscrupulous
a
miscreant
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
,
at
this
time
,
be
on
the
high
-
road
to
the
greatness
which
he
subsequently
,
and
not
long
afterwards
,
obtain
.
<EOS>
He
be
fast
rise
to
an
eminence
that
no
one
of
his
nefarious
profession
ever
reach
before
him
,
nor
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
will
ever
reach
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
Napoleon
of
knavery
,
and
establish
an
uncontrolled
empire
over
all
the
practitioner
of
crime
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
light
conquest
;
nor
be
it
a
government
easily
maintain
.
<EOS>
resolution
,
severity
,
subtlety
,
be
require
for
it
;
and
these
be
quality
which
Jonathan
possess
in
an
extraordinary
degree
.
<EOS>
the
danger
or
difficulty
of
an
exploit
never
appal
him
.
<EOS>
what
his
head
conceive
his
hand
execute
.
<EOS>
profess
to
stand
between
the
robber
and
the
rob
,
he
himself
plunder
both
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
be
who
form
the
grand
design
of
a
robber
corporation
,
of
which
he
should
be
the
sole
head
and
director
,
with
the
right
of
deliver
those
who
conceal
their
booty
,
or
refuse
to
share
it
with
him
,
to
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
He
divide
London
into
district
;
appoint
a
gang
to
each
district
;
and
a
leader
to
each
gang
,
whom
he
hold
responsible
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
country
be
partition
in
a
similar
manner
.
<EOS>
those
whom
he
retain
about
his
person
,
or
place
in
office
of
trust
,
be
for
the
most
part
convict
felon
,
who
,
have
return
from
transportation
before
their
term
have
expire
,
constitute
,
in
his
opinion
,
the
safe
agent
,
inasmuch
as
they
could
neither
be
legal
evidence
against
him
,
nor
withhold
any
portion
of
the
spoil
of
which
he
choose
to
deprive
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
crowning
glory
of
Jonathan
,
that
which
raise
him
above
all
his
predecessor
in
iniquity
,
and
clothe
this
name
with
undye
notoriety
--
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
when
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
,
he
commence
a
terrible
trade
,
till
then
unknown
--
namely
,
a
traffic
in
human
blood
.
<EOS>
this
he
carry
on
by
procure
witness
to
swear
away
the
life
of
those
person
who
have
incur
his
displeasure
,
or
whom
it
may
be
necessary
to
remove
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
Trenchard
,
as
he
gaze
at
this
fearful
being
,
should
have
some
misgiving
cross
him
.
 
<EOS>
apparently
,
Jonathan
perceive
he
be
an
object
of
scrutiny
;
for
,
hastily
dismiss
his
attendant
,
he
walk
towards
the
knight

<EOS>
"

CHAPTER
XVII
.
 
<EOS>
the
Night
-
Cellar
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
'
rapid
walking
,
during
which
neither
party
utter
a
word
,
Jonathan
Wild
and
his
companion
have
pass
Saint
Paul
's
,
dive
down
a
thoroughfare
on
the
right
,
and
reach
Thames
Street
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
period
of
this
history
,
the
main
street
of
the
metropolis
be
but
imperfectly
light
,
while
the
less
-
frequent
avenue
be
leave
in
total
obscurity
;
but
,
even
at
the
present
time
,
the
maze
of
court
and
alley
into
which
Wild
now
plunge
,
would
have
perplex
any
one
,
not
familiar
with
their
intricacy
,
to
thread
them
on
a
dark
night
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
be
well
acquaint
with
the
road
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
his
boast
that
he
could
find
his
way
through
any
part
of
London
blindfold
;
and
by
this
time
,
it
would
seem
,
he
have
nearly
arrive
at
his
destination
;
for
,
grasp
his
companion
's
arm
,
he
lead
him
along
a
narrow
entry
which
do
not
appear
to
have
an
outlet
,
and
come
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
caution
the
knight
,
if
he
value
his
neck
,
to
tread
carefully
,
Jonathan
then
descend
a
steep
flight
of
step
;
and
,
have
reach
the
bottom
in
safety
,
he
push
open
a
door
,
that
swing
back
on
its
hinge
as
soon
as
it
have
admit
him
;
and
,
follow
by
Trenchard
,
enter
the
night
-
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
the
vault
,
in
which
Sir
Rowland
find
himself
,
resemble
in
some
measure
the
cabin
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
It
be
long
and
narrow
,
with
a
ceiling
support
by
huge
uncovered
rafter
,
and
so
low
as
scarcely
to
allow
a
tall
man
like
himself
to
stand
erect
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
heat
of
the
season,--which
be
not
,
however
,
find
particularly
inconvenient
in
this
subterranean
region,--a
large
heap
-
up
fire
blaze
ruddily
in
one
corner
,
and
light
up
a
circle
of
as
villanous
countenance
as
ever
flame
shine
upon
.
 
<EOS>
the
guest
congregate
within
the
night
-
cellar
be
,
in
fact
,
little
well
than
thief
;
but
thief
who
confine
their
depredation
almost
exclusively
to
the
vessel
lie
in
the
pool
and
dock
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
have
as
many
designation
as
grade
.
<EOS>
there
be
game
waterman
and
game
lighterman
,
heavy
horseman
and
light

,
scuffle
-
hunter
,
and
long

apron
man
,
lumper
,
journeymen
coopers
,
mud
-
lark
,
badger
,
and
ratcatcher
--
a
race
of
dangerous
vermin
recently
,
in
a
great
measure
,
extirpate
by
the
vigilance
of
the
Thames
Police
,
but
at
this
period
flourish
in
vast
number
.
<EOS>
besides
these
plunderer
,
there
be
other
with
whom
the
disposal
of
their
pillage
necessarily
bring
them
into
contact
,
and
who
seldom
fail
to
attend
them
during
their
hour
of
relaxation
and
festivity;--to
wit
,
dealer
in
junk
,
old
rag
,
and
marine
store
,
purchaser
of
prize
-
money
,
crimp
,
and
Jew
receiver
.
<EOS>
the
latter
form
by
far
the
most
knavish
-
looking
and
unprepossessing
portion
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
the
table

group
of
fat
frowzy
woman
in
flat
cap
,
with
ring
on
their
thumb
,
and
basket
by
their
side
;
and
no
one
who
have
listen
for
a
single
moment
to
their
coarse
language
and
violent
abuse
of
each
other
,
would
require
to
be
tell
they
be
fish
-
wife
from
Billingsgate
.
 
<EOS>
the
present
divinity
of
the
cellar
be
a
comely
middle
-
aged
dame
,
almost
as
stout
,
and
quite
as
shrill

as

Billingsgate

brown
complexion
,
almost
as
dark
as
a
Creole
;
and
a
moustache
on
her
upper
lip
,
that
would
have
do
no
discredit
to
the
old
dragoon
in
the
King
's
service
.
<EOS>
this
lady
be
singularly
lucky
in
her
matrimonial
connection
.
<EOS>
She

by
Jonathan

who
not
only

to
bring
him
off
,
but
to
obtain
for
him
the
situation
of
under

turnkey
in
Newgate

on

but

for
him
and
the

through
the
crowd
,
and
usher
them

with
much
ceremony
,
into
an
inner

where
they

of
their

natured
fellow

inexplicable
look,--of
<EOS>
her
sudden
shriek

<EOS>
explain
his
suspicious
in
a
whisper
to
Jack

captor
,
who
prove

but
without
success
.
<EOS>
Jack
submit
to
this
scrutiny
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
and
vehemently
protest
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
in
vain
do
the
woollen

draper
offer
to
set
him
free
if

<EOS>
nor
do
he
content
himself
with
declare
his
guiltlessness
of
the
crime

to
him
,
but
begin
in
his
turn
to
menace
his
captor
and
accuser
,

the
bitter
upbraiding

after
a
consultation
between
Mr.
Dump
and
the
village
authority
,
it
be
agree
to
lock
up
the
prisoner
in

<EOS>
as

,
an
incident
occur
that
produce
a
considerable
impression
on
the
feeling
of
the
youthful
offender
.
<EOS>
just
as
they
reach
the
eastern
outlet
of
the
churchyard
--
where
the
tall
elm

a
pleasant
shade
over

<EOS>
It
be
his
mother
,
and
as
he
gaze
on
her
pallid
feature
and
motionless
frame
,
Jack
's
heart
severely
smote
him
.
<EOS>
He
urge
his
conductor
to
a
quick
pace
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
distressing
spectacle
,
and
even
feel
relieved
when
he
be
shut
out
from

and
the
execration
of
the
mob

to
the
neighbouring
village
of
Neasdon
and
Kingsbury
,
and
on

strong
door

with
an
iron
grating
at
the
top

and
further
secure
by
a
stout
bolt
and
padlock

<EOS>
It
be
picturesquely
situate
beneath
a
tree
on
the
high
road
,
not
far
from
the
little
hostel
before

and
at
no

<EOS>
for
some
time
after
he
be
lock
up
in
this
prison
<EOS>
Jack
continue
in
a
very
dejected
state
.
<EOS>
desert
by
his
old
companion
in
iniquity
,
and
instigator
to
crime
,
he
do
not
know
what
may
become
of
him
;
nor
,
as
we
have
observe
,
be
the
sad
spectacle
he
have
just
witness
,
without
effect
.
<EOS>
though
within
the
last
two
day
he
have
commit
several
heinous
offence
,
and
one
of
a
dark
dye
than
any
with
which
the
reader
have
be
make
acquainted
,
his
breast
be
not
yet
so
callous
as
to
be
wholly
insensible
to
the
sting
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
weary
at
length
with
think
on
the
past
,
and
terrify
by
the
prospect
of
the
future
,
he
throw
himself
on
the
straw
with
which
the
cage
be
litter
,
and
endeavour
to
compose
himself
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
when
he
awake
,
it
be
late
in
the
day
;
but
though
he
hear
voice
outside
,
and
now
and
then
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
face
peep
at
him
through
the
iron
grating
over
the
door
,
no
one
enter
the
prison
,
or
hold
any
communication
with
him
.
<EOS>
feel
rather
exhausted
,
it
occur
to
him
that
possibly
some
provision
may
have
be
leave
by
the
constable
;
and
,
look
about
,
he
perceive
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
small
brown
loaf
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
He
eat
of
the
bread
with
great
appetite
,
and
have
drunk
as
much
as
he
choose
of
the
water
,
pour
the
rest
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
His
hunger
satisfy
,
his
spirit
begin
to
revive
,
and
with
this
change
of
mood
all
his
natural
audacity
return
.
<EOS>
and
here
he
be
first
visit
by
that
genius
which
,
in
his
subsequent
career
,
prompt
him
to
so
many
bold
and
successful
attempt
.
<EOS>
glance
around
his
prison
,
he
begin
to
think
it
possible
he
may
effect
an
escape
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
too
strong
,
and
too
well
secured
,
to
break
open,--the
wall
too
thick
:
but
the
ceiling,--if
he
could
reach
it
--
there
,
he
doubt
not
,

<EOS>
while

and
toss
about
on
the
straw
,
he
chance
upon
an
old
broken
and
rusty
fork
.
<EOS>
here
be
an
instrument
which
may
be
of
the
great
service
to
him
in
accomplish
his
design
.
<EOS>
He
put
it
carefully
aside
,
resolve
to
defer
the
attempt
till
night
.
<EOS>
Time
wear
on
somewhat
slowly
with
the
prisoner
,
who
have
to
control
his
impatience
in
the
good
way
he
could
;
but
as
the
shade
of
evening
be
darken
,
the
door
be
unlock
,
and
Mr.
Dump
pop
his
head
into

He

to
this
Jack

,
that
he
should
be
perfectly
content
,
provide

may
have
a
small
allowance
of
gin

<EOS>
the
latter
request

though
treat
with
supreme
contempt
by
Mr.
Dump
,
make
an
impression
on
some
one
outside
;
for
not
long
after
the
constable
depart
,
Jack
hear
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
get
up
at
the
summon
,
he
perceive
the
tube
of
a
pipe
insert
between
the
bar

<EOS>
at
once
divine
the
meaning
of
this
ingenious
device
,
he
apply
his
mouth
to
the
tube
,
and
suck
away
,
while
the
person
outside
pour
spirit
into
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
have
drunk
as
much
as
he
think
prudent
,
and
thank
his
unknown
friend
for
his
attention
,
Jack
again
lie
down
on
the
straw
,
and
indulge
himself
with
another
nap
,
intend
to
get
up
as

with
fatigue

,
and
when

just
begin
to
grow
light

<EOS>
curse
himself
for
his
inertness

off
this
drowsiness
,
and
set
to
work
in
earnest

<EOS>
avail
himself
of
certain
inequality
in

up
to

and
secure
his
foot
against
a
slight
projection
in
the
wall
,
begin
to
use
the
fork
with
great
effect
.
<EOS>
before
many

CHAPTER
I.
 
<EOS>
the
Return
.
  
<EOS>
nearly
nine
year
after
the
event
last
record
,
and
about
the
middle
of
May
,
1724
,
a
young
man
of
remarkably
prepossess
appearance
take
his
way
,
one
afternoon
,
along
Wych
Street
;
and
,
from
the
curiosity
with
which
he
regard
the
house
on
the
left
of
the
road
,
seem
to
be
in
search
of
some
particular
habitation
.
<EOS>
the
age
of
this
individual
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
-
one
;
his
figure
be
tall
,
robust
,
and
gracefully
proportion
;
and
his
clear
gray
eye
and
open
countenance
bespoke
a
frank
,
generous
,
and
resolute
nature
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
regular
,
and
finely
-
form
;
his
complexion
bright
and
blooming,--a
<EOS>
little
shaded
,
however
,
by
travel
and
exposure
to
the
sun
;
and
,
with
a
praiseworthy
contempt
for
the
universal
and
preposterous
fashion
then
prevail
,
of
substitute
a
peruke
for
the
natural
covering
of
the
head
,
he
allow
his
own
dark
-
brown
hair
to
fall
over
his
shoulder
in
ringlet
as
luxuriant
as
those
that
distinguish
the
court
gallant
in
Charles
the
Second
's
day
--
a
fashion
,
which
we
do
not
despair
of
see
revive
in
our
own
day
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
french
military
undress
of
the
period
,
with
high
jack
-
boot
,
and
a
laced
hat
;
and
,
though
his
attire
indicate
no
particular
rank
,
he
have
completely
the
air
of
a
person
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
effect
produce
upon
the
passenger
by
his
good
look
and
manly
deportment
,
<EOS>
that
few
--
especially
of
the
gentle
and
more
susceptible
sex
--
fail
to
turn
round
and
bestow
a
second
glance
upon
the
handsome
stranger
.
<EOS>
unconscious
of
the
interest
he
excite
,
and
entirely
occupy
by
his
own
thought
--
which
,
if
his
bosom
could
have
be
examine
,
would
have
be
find
compose
of
mingled
hope
and
fear
--
the
young
man
walk
on
till
he
come
to
an
old
house
,
with
great
projecting
bay
window
on
the
first
floor
,
and
situate
as
nearly
as
possible
at
the
back
of
St.
Clement
's
church
.
<EOS>
here
he
halt
;
and
,
look
upwards
,
read
,
at
the
foot
of
an
immense
sign
-
board
,
display
a
gaudily
-
paint
angel
with
expanded
pinion
and
an
olive
-
branch
,
not
the
name
he
expect
to
find
,
but
that
of
WILLIAM
KNEEBONE
,

-
DRAPER

<EOS>
tear
start
to
the
young
man
's
eye
on
behold
the
change
,
and
it
be
with
difficulty
he
could
command
himself
sufficiently
to
make
the
inquiry
he
desire
to
do
respect
the
former
owner
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
he
enter
the
shop
,
a
tall
portly
personage
advanced
to
meet
him
,
whom
he
at
once
recognise
as
the
present
proprietor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
be
attire
in
the
extremity
of
the
mode
.
<EOS>

full

curled
wig

half

way
down

back
and
shoulder
;
a
neckcloth
of
"
right
Mechlin
"
be
twist
round
his
throat
so
tightly
as
almost
to
deprive
him
of
breath
,
and
threaten
him
with
apoplexy
;
he
have
lace
,
also
,
at
his
wrist
and
bosom
;
gold
clock
to
his
hose
,
and
red
heel
to
his

<EOS>

formally

cut
coat

with

pocket
,
and
skirt

the
middle
of
his
leg
;
and
his
costume
be
complete
by
the
silver
-
hilte
sword
at
his
side
,
and
the
laced
hat
under
his
left
arm

<EOS>
bow
to
the
stranger
,
the
woollen
-
draper
very
politely
request
to
know
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
afraid
to
state
it
,
"
<EOS>
falter
the
other
;
"
but
,
may
I
ask
whether
Mr.
Wood
,
the
carpenter
,
who
formerly
reside
here
,
be
still
live
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
feel
any
anxiety
on
his
account

Sir
,
I
be
happy
to
be
able
to
relieve
it
,
"
answer
Kneebone
,
readily
.
<EOS>
"
My
good
friend
,
Owen
Wood,--Heaven
preserve
him!--_is
_
still

and
,
for
a
man

will
never

I
assure

You

the
stranger

entirely
recover
his
cheerfulness
of
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
fear
,
from
his
have
quit
the
old
place
,
that
some
misfortune
must
have
befall
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
quite
the
contrary
,
"
rejoin
the
woollen

draper
,
laugh
good

humouredly
.
<EOS>
"
everything
have
prosper
with
him
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
<EOS>
His
business
have
thrive
;
legacy
have
unexpectedly
drop
into
his
lap
;
and
,
to
crown
all
,
he
have
make
a
large
fortune
by
a
lucky
speculation
in
South

Sea
stock,--made
it

where
so
many

<EOS>
in

word

Sir

Mr.
Wood
be
now
in
very
affluent
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
stick
to
the
shop
as
long
as
it
be
necessary
,
and
longer
,
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
these
premise
,
three
year
ago
,
I
take
them
from
him
;
or
rather
--
to
deal
frankly
with
you,--he
place
me
in

free

for

I
be
not
ashamed

enormous
pinch

snuff
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
do
not
dislike
to

rally
about
his
gallantry,--"so
she

those

her

that

with
a
self

sufficient
smirk

<EOS>
the
stranger
look
at
him
as

strongly
disposed
to
chastise
his
impertinence

<EOS>
"
be

married

after

brief
pause

married!--no

no

"
<EOS>
winifred
Wood
will
never

when

Thames

her
father
bring
up

about
nine

remain
faithful

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
astonish
me

"
say
the
stranger

in
a
voice
full
of
emotion

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
it

be
_
astonishing

certainly
,
"
remark
Kneebone
,
"
to
find
any
woman
constant
--
especially
to
a
girlish
attachment

but
such
be
the
case

<EOS>
She
have
have
offer
innumerable
;
for
where
wealth

beauty
be
combine

as
in
her
instance

<EOS>
"
so
I
think
,
"
reply
Kneebone
,
again
apply
to
the
snuff

box
,
and
by
that
mean
escape
the
angry
glance
level
at
him
by
his
companion

<EOS>
"
I
have
one
inquiry
more
to
make
of
you

Sir
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
as
soon
as
he
have
conquer
his
displeasure
,

I
will
then
trouble
you
no
further
.
<EOS>
You
speak
just
now
of
a
youth
whom
Mr.
Wood
bring
up
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
recollect
,
there
be
two
.
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
the
other
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
surely
you
do
not
mean
Jack
Sheppard
?
"
cry
the
woollen

draper
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
lad
's
name
,
"
return
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guess
from
your
dress
and
manner
,
Sir
,
that
you
must
have
be
long
absent
from
your
own
country
,
"
say
Kneebone
;
"
and
now
I
be
convinced
of
it
,
or
you
would
not
have
ask
that
question
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
be
the
talk
and
terror
of
the
whole
town
.
<EOS>
the
lady
can
not
sleep
in
their
bed
for
him
;
and
as
to
the
man
,
they
dare
not
go
to
bed
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
most
daring
and
expert
housebreaker
that
ever
use
a
crow
-
bar
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
at
lock
and
bolt
;
and
the
more
carefully
you
guard
your
premise
from
him
,
the
more
likely
be
you
to
insure
an
attack
.
<EOS>
His
exploit
and
escape
be
in
every
body
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
lodge
in
every
round
-
house
in
the
metropolis
,
and
have
break
out
of
them
all
,
and
boast
that
no
prison
can
hold
him
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
His
skill
have
not
be
try
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
he
be
under
the
protection
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
that
villain
still
maintain
his
power
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
stranger
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
,
"

Kneebone
,
"
and
,
what
be
more
surprising
,
it
seem
to
increase
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
completely
baffle
and
deride
the
end
of
justice
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
contend
with
him
,
even
with
right
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
some
year
ago
,
in
1715
,
just
before
the
rebellion
,
I
be
rash
enough
to
league
myself
with
the
Jacobite
party
,
and
by
Wild
's
machination
get
clap
into
Newgate
,
whence
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
escape
with
my
head
upon
my
shoulder

<EOS>
I
charge
the
thief

taker
,
as
be
the
fact
,
with
have
rob
me
,
by
mean
of
the
lad
Sheppard
,
whom
he
instigate
to
deed
,
of
the
very
pocket
-
book
he
produce
in
evidence
against
me
;
but
it
be
of
no
avail
--
I
could
not
obtain
a
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
fare
still
bad

<EOS>
bribe
by
a
certain
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard

Jonathan

the
carpenter

son
,
Thames
Darrell
,
and
place
him
in
the
hand
of
a
Dutch
Skipper
,
with
order
to
throw
him
overboard
when
he
get
out
to
sea

and
though
this

as
clear
as

the
rascal
manage
matter
so
adroitly

and
give
such
a
different
complexion
to
the
whole
affair
,
that
he
come
off
with
fly
colour
.
<EOS>
one
reason
,
perhaps
,
of
his
success
in
this
case
may
be
,
that
have
arrest
his

dark
transaction

afterwards,--at

dark
cloud

do
you

further

not

without
apprehension

from
the
fact
of
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood,--now
judge
it
more
prudent
to
say
nothing
on
the
subject

from
a
fear
of
increase
Mrs.

displeasure

and
he

"
Bess
would
not

wish
to
do
old

a
friendly
turn
,
you
may
bring
his

"
I

rid
him
of

gruffly

seize
me

<EOS>
"
You

sternly

"
<EOS>
I
have
just
say
I
will
have
no

mind
that

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
,
they
dismount
;
and
fasten
their
horse
to
a
tree
,
proceed
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
so
dark
,
that
nothing
could
be
distinguish
except
the
heavy
masse
of
timber
by
which
the
premise
be
surround
;
but
as
they
advance

<EOS>
presently
they
come
to
a
wall

on
the
other

of
which
the

begin
to
bark
violently
;
but
Blueskin
toss
him
a
piece
of
prepared
meat
,
and
utter
a
low
growl
,
he
become
silent

They
then
clamber
over
a
hedge
,
and
scale
another
wall
,
get
into
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house

with
noiseless
step
over
the
soft

<EOS>
arrive
there

about
for
a
particular

<EOS>
Jack
now
carefully

the
shutter
,
while
Blueskin

a
light
,
with

he
set

<EOS>
the
room

be
in

but
this
be
only

<EOS>
the
operation
be

with
so
much
rapidity
and
so
little
noise
,
that
even
if
any

have
be
on
the
alert
,
he
could
scarcely
have
detect
it
.
<EOS>
They
then
take
off
their
boot
,
and
creep
stealthily
up
stair
,
tread
upon
the
point
of
their
toe
so
cautiously
,
that
not

beneath
their
weight

<EOS>
pause
at

as
a
workman

have
choose

and

,
pistol

step
up
to

from

deep
and
real

and
unconscious
of
the
danger
in
which

more
comfortable

and
agreeable
demeanour

the

before

--
the
third
of
the
prisoner
's
detention
--
an
old

to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
friend

to
visit
him
,
;
but
as
he
have
openly
avow
his
intention
of
attempt
an
escape
,
their
proceeding
be
narrowly
watch

<EOS>
the
old
man
be
conduct
to
Jack
's
cell
by
the
turnkey
,
who
remain
near
him
during
their
interview
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
a
stranger
to
the
prisoner
,
and
the
sole
motive
of
his
visit
,
curiosity
.
<EOS>
after
a
brief
conversation
,
which
Sheppard
sustain
with
his
accustomed
liveliness
,
the
old
man
turn
to
Bess
and
address
a
few
word
of
common
-
place
gallantry
to
her
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Jack
suddenly
make
a
movement
which
attract
the
turnkey
's
attention
;
and
during
that
interval
the
old
man
slip
some
article
wrap
in
a
handkerchief
into
Bess
's
hand
,
who
instantly
secrete
them
in
her
bosom

<EOS>
the
turnkey

round
the
next
moment
,
but

<EOS>
after

little
further
discourse
the
old
man
take
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
leave
alone
with
Edgeworth
Bess
<EOS>
,
Jack
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
of
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blueskin
's
a
friend
in
need
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
His
disguise
be
capital
;
but
I
detect
it
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
have
he
give
you
the
tool
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
,
"
reply
Bess
,
produce
the
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
"
cry
Sheppard
,
examine
its
content
,
which
prove
to
be
a
file
,
a
chisel
,
two
or
three
gimblet
,
and
a
piercer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
shall
find
it
be
not
easy
to
detain
me
.
<EOS>
as
sure
as
he
be
now
live
,
I
will
pay
him
a
visit
in
the
Old
Bailey
before
morning
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
pay
off
old
score
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
worth
while
be
send
to
prison
to
have
the
pleasure
of
escape
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
be
able
to
test
my
skill
.
"
<EOS>
and
run
on
in
this
way
,
he
carefully
conceal
the
tool
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
turnkey
entertain
any
suspicion
of
the
old
man
,
Jack
could
not
tell
,
but
that
night
he
be
more
than
usually
rigorous
in
his
search
;
and
have
carefully
examine
the
prisoner
and
find
nothing
to
excite
his
suspicion
,
he
depart
tolerably
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
certain
he
should
be
disturb
no
more
,
Jack
set
to
work
,
and
with
the
aid
of
the
file
in
less
than
an
hour
have
free
himself
from
his
fetter
.
<EOS>
with
Bess
's
assistance
he
then
climb
up
to
the
window
,
which
,
as
have
just
be
state
,
be
secure
by
iron
bar
of
great
thickness
cross
by
a
stout
beam
of
oak
.
<EOS>
the
very
sight
of
these
impediment
,
would
have
appal
a
less
courageous
spirit
than
Sheppard's
--
but
nothing
could
daunt
him
.
<EOS>
to
work
then
he
go
,
and
with
wonderful
industry
file
off
two
of
the
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
complete
this
operation
,
the
file
break
.
<EOS>
the
oaken
beam
,
nine
inch
in
thickness
,
be
now
the
sole
but
most
formidable
obstacle
to
his
flight
.
<EOS>
with
his
gimblet
he
contrive
to
bore
a
number
of
hole
<EOS>
so
close
together
that
at
last
one
end
of
the
bar
,
be
completely
pierce
through
,
yield
;
and
pursue
the
same
with
the
other
extremity
,
it
fall
out
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
operation
be
so
fatigue
,
that
for
a
short
time
he
be
oblige
to
pause
to
recover
the
use
of
his
finger
.
<EOS>
He
then
descend
;
and
have
induce
Bess
to
take
off
some
part
of
her
clothing
,
he
tear
the
gown
and
petticoat
into
shred
and
twist
them
into
a
sort
of
rope
which
he
fasten
to
the
low
bar
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
with
some
difficulty
he
contrive
to
raise
her
to
the
window
,
and
with
still
great
difficulty
to
squeeze
her
through
it
--
her
bulk
be
much
great
than
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
then
make
a
sort
of
run
noose
,
pass
it
over
her
body
,
and
take
firmly
hold
of
the
bar
,
prepare
to
guide
her
descent
.
<EOS>
but
Bess
could
scarcely
summon
resolution
enough
to
hazard
the
experiment
;
and
it
be
only
on
Jack
's
urgent
intreatie
,
and
even
threat
,
that
she
could
be
prevail
on
to
trust
herself
to
the
frail
tenure
of
the
rope
he
have
prepare
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
she
throw
herself
off
;
and
Jack
carefully
guide
the
rope
she
land
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
moment
he
be
by
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
great
point
be
still
unaccomplishe
.
<EOS>
They
have
escape
from
the
New
Prison
,
it
be
true
;
but
the
wall
of
Clerkenwell
Bridewell
,
by
which
that
jail
be
formerly
surround
,
and
which
be
more
than
twenty
foot
high
,
and
protect
by
formidable
and
bristling
_
chevaux
de
frise
_
,
remain
to
be
scale
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
however
,
have
an
expedient
for
master
this
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
venture
to
the
great
gate
,
and
by
insert
his
gimblet
into
the
wood
at
interval
,
so
as
to
form
point
upon
which
he
could
rest
his
foot
,
he
contrive
,
to
ascend
them
;
and
when
at
the
top
,
have
fasten
a
portion
of
his
dress
to
the
spike
,
he
manage
,
not
without
considerable
risk
,
to
draw
up
his
female
companion
.
<EOS>
once
over
the
iron
spike
,
Bess
exhibit
no
reluctance
to
be
let
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
have
see
his
mistress
safe
down
,
Jack
instantly
descend
,
leave
the
good
part
of
his
clothe
,
as
a
memorial
of
his
flight
,
to
the
jailor
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
he
effect
his
escape
from
the
New
Prison
.

CHAPTER
V.
 
<EOS>
the
Disguise
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
hollow
in
the
meadow
behind
the
prison
whence
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
have
<EOS>
escaped,--for
,
at
this
time
,
the
whole
of
the
now
thickly
-
people
district
north
of
Clerkenwell
Bridewell
be
open
country
,
stretch
out
in
fertile
field
in
the
direction
of
Islington
--
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
stand
a
solitary
hovel
,
know
as
Black
Mary
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
this
spot
,
which
still
retain
its
name
,
acquire
the
appellation
from
an
old
crone
who
live
there
,
and
who
,
in
addition
to
a
very
equivocal
character
for
honesty
,
enjoy
the
reputation
of
be
a
witch
.
<EOS>
without
inquire
into
the
correctness
of
the
latter
part
of
the
story
,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
,
that
Black
Mary
be
a
person
in
whom
Jack
Sheppard
think
he
could
confide
,
and
,
as
Edgeworth
Bess
be
incapable
of
much
further
exertion
,
he
determine
to
leave
her
in
the
old
woman
's
care
till
the
follow
night
,
while
he
shift
for
himself
and
fulfil
his
design
--
for
,
however
rash
or
hazardous
a
project
may
be
,
if
once
conceive
,
Jack
always
execute
it,--of
visit
Jonathan
Wild
at
his
house
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
precisely
two
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
Whit
-
monday
,
the
25th
of
May
1724
,
when
the
remarkable
escape
before
detail
be
complete
:
and
,
though
it
want
full
two
hour
to
daybreak
,
the
glimmer
of
a
wane
moon
prevent
it
from
be
totally
dark
.
<EOS>
cast
a
hasty
glance
,
as
he
be
about
to
turn
an
angle
of
the
wall
,
at
the
great
gate
and
upper
window
of
the
prison
,
and
perceive
no
symptom
of
pursuit
,
Jack
proceed
towards
the
hovel
at
a
very
deliberate
pace
,
carefully
assist
his
female
companion
over
every
obstacle
in
the
road
,
and
bear
her
in
his
arm
when
,
as
be
more
than
once
the
case
,
she
sink
from
fright
and
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
he
cross
one
or
two
public
garden
and
a
bowling
-
green,--the
neighbourhood
of
Clerkenwell
then
abound
in
such
place
of
amusement,--passed
the
note
Ducking
Pond
,
where
Black
Mary
have
be
frequently
immerse
;
and
,
strike
off
to
the
left
across
the
field
,
arrive
in
a
few
minute
at
his
destination
.
 
<EOS>
descend
the
hollow
,
or
rather
excavation,--for
<EOS>
it
be
an
old
disuse
clay
-
pit
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
cottage
be
situated,--he
speedily
succeed
in
arouse
the
ancient
sibyl
,
and
have
commit
Edgeworth
Bess
to
her
care
,
with
a
promise
of
an
abundant
reward
in
case
she
watch
diligently
over
her
safety
,
and
attend
to
her
comfort
till
his
return,--to
all
which
Black
Mary
<EOS>
readily
agreed,--he
depart
with
a
heart
lighten
of
half
its
load
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
first
object
be
to
seek
out
Blueskin
,
whom
he
have
no
doubt
he
should
find
at
the
New
Mint
,
at
wapping
,
for
the
Old
Mint
no
longer
afford
a
secure
retreat
to
the
robber
;
and
,
with
this
view
,
he
make
the
good
of
his
way
along
a
bye
-
lane
lead
towards
hockley
-
in
-
the
-
Hole
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
proceed
far
when
he
be
alarm
by
the
tramp
of
a
horse
,
which
seem
to
be
rapidly
approach
,
and
he
have
scarcely
time
to
leap
the
hedge
and
conceal
himself
behind
a
tree
,
when
a
tall
man
,
envelop
in
an
ample
cloak
,
with
his
hat
pull
over
his
brow
,
ride
by
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
another
horseman
follow
quickly
at
the
heel
of
the
first
;
but
just
as
he
pass
the
spot
where
Jack
stand
,
his
steed
miss
its
footing
,
and
fall
.
<EOS>
either
ignorant
of
the
accident
,
or
heedless
of
it
,
the
foremost
horseman
pursue
his
way
without
even
turn
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
conceive
the
opportunity
too
favourable
to
be
lose
,
Jack
spring
suddenly
over
the
hedge
,
and
before
the
man
,
who
be
flounder
on
the
ground
with
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
could
extricate
himself
from
his
embarrassing
position
,
secure
his
pistol
,
which
he
draw
from
the
holster
,
and
hold
them
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
swear
lustily
,
in
a
voice
which
Jack
instantly
recognise
as
that
of
Quilt
Arnold
,
and
vainly
attempt
to
rise
and
draw
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dog
!
"
thunder
Sheppard
,
put
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
so
close
to
the
janizary
's
ear
,
that
the
touch
of
the
cold
iron
make
him
start
,
"
do
not
you
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
blood
and
thunder
!
"
exclaim
Quilt
,
open
his
eye
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
Captain
Sheppard
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
be
_
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Jack
;
"
and
you
have
better
have
meet
the
devil
on
your
road
than
me
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
what
I
say
when
you
take
me
at
the
Mint
four
day
ago
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
my
turn
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
_
have
_
<EOS>
come,--and
sooner
than
you
expect

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
find
,
Captain
,
"
rejoin
quilt
,
submissively
;
"
but
you
be
too
noble
-
hearted
to
take
advantage
of
my
situation
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
act
for
other
,
and
not
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
reply
Sheppard
,
"
and
therefore
I
spare
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
would
not
injure
me
,
Captain
,
"
remark
quilt
,
in
a
wheedling
tone
,
while
he
feel
about
for
his
sword
;
"
you
be
far
too
brave
to
strike
a
fall
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jack
,
who
have
notice
the
movement
;
"
make
such
another
attempt
,
and
it
shall
cost
you
your
life

"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
unbuckle
the
belt
to
which
the
janizary
's
hanger
be
attach
,
and
fasten
it
to
his
own
girdle

"
and
now

he
continue

sternly
,

Jack

in
amazement

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long

Captain

rejoin

continue

again
raise

CHAPTER
VI

<EOS>
winifre

two
proposal
.
  
<EOS>
the
tragical
affair
at
Dollis
Hill
,
it
nee
scarcely
be
say
,
be
a
dreadful
blow
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mr.

up
with
great
fortitude
against
the
shock
,
attend
the
inquest

deliver
his
evidence
with
composure
,
and
give
direction
afterwards
for
the
funeral
,
which
take
place
on
the
day

one
following
--
Sunday
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
however
,
as
the
last
solemn
rite
be
over
,
and
the
remain
of
the
unfortunate
woman
commit
to
their
final
resting
-
place
in
Willesden
churchyard
,
his
firmness
completely
desert
him
,
and
he
sink
beneath
the
weight
of
his
affliction
.
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
that
by
this
time
Winifred
have
so
far
recover
,
as
to
be
able
to
afford
her
father
the
good
and
only
solace
that
,
under
the
circumstance
,
he
could
have
received,--her
personal
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
necessity
which
have
previously
exist
of
leave
the
ghastly
evidence
of
the
murderous
deed
undisturbed,--the
presence
of
the
mangle
corpse,--the
bustle
of
the
inquest
,
at
which
her
attendance
be
required,--all
these
circumstance
produce
a
harrowing
effect
upon
the
young
girl
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
but
when
all
be
over
,
a
sorrowful
calm
succeed
,
and
,
if
not
free
from
grief
,
she
be
tranquil
.
<EOS>
as
to
Thames
,
though
deeply
and
painfully
affect
by
the
horrible
occurrence
that
have
mark
his
return
to
his
old
friend
,
he
be
yet
able
to
control
his
feeling
,
and
devote
himself
to
the
alleviation
of
the
distress
of
the
more
immediate
sufferer
by
the
calamity
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Sunday
evening
--
a
soft
delicious
evening
,
and
,
from
the
happy
,
<EOS>
_
cheerful
<EOS>
_
look
of
the
house
,
none
would
have
dream
of
the
dismal
tragedy
so
lately
act
within
its
wall
.
<EOS>
the
bird
be
singe
blithely
amid
the
trees,--the
lowing
of
the
cow
resound
from
the
yard,--a
delicious
perfume
from
the
garden
be
waft
through
the
open
window,--at
a
distance
,
the
church
-
bell
of
Willesden
be
hear
toll
for
evening
service
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
speak
of
<EOS>
peace;--but
there
be
season
when
the
pleasantest
external
influence
have
a
depressing
effect
on
the
mind
,
by
painfully
recall
past
happiness
.
<EOS>
so
,
at
least
,
think
one
of
two
person
who
be
seat
together
in
a
small
back
-
parlour
of
the
house
at
Dollis
Hill
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
lovely
girl
,
attire
in
deep
mourning
,
and
have
an
expression
of
profound
sorrow
on
her
charming
feature
.
<EOS>
Her
companion
be
a
portly
handsome
man
,
also
dress
in
a
full
suit
of
the
deep
mourning
,
with
the
fine
of
lace
at
his
bosom
and
wrist
,
and
a
sword
in
a
black
sheath
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
these
person
be
Mr.
Kneebone
and
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
the
funeral
,
it
have
just
be
say
,
take
place
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
amongst
other
who
attend
the
sad
ceremony
be
Mr.
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
conceive
himself
call
upon
,
as
the
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
,
to
pay
this
last
tribute
of
respect
to
her
memory
,
he
appear
as
one
of
the
chief
mourner
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
his
affliction
,
Mr.
Wood
have
retire
to
his
own
room
,
where
he
have
just
summon
Thames
.
<EOS>
much
to
her
annoyance
,
therefore
,
Winifred
be
leave
alone
with
the
woollen
-
draper
,
who
follow
up
a
maxim
of
his
own
,
"
that
nothing
be
gain
by
too
much
bashfulness
,
"
determine
to
profit
by
the
opportunity

<EOS>
He
have
only
be
prevent
,
indeed
,
by
a
fear
of
Mrs.
Wood
from
press
his
suit
long
ago

<EOS>
this
obstacle
remove
,
he
think
he
may
now
make
the
attempt

<EOS>
happen
what
may

he
could
not
be
in
a
bad
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
have
a
sad
loss
,
<EOS>
my
dear
winifre
,
"
<EOS>
he
began,--"for
<EOS>
I
must
use
the

<EOS>
this
be
not
exactly

the

desire

<EOS>
so
he
resolve
to
try
another
tack

what

thing
it
be

observe

apply
to
his
snuff

box
,

,

in
his

sincerely

be
so,--"should

artlessly

<EOS>

<EOS>

of
course
,
"
rejoin

a

maliciously
,

that
be
easily
account
for

May
I
be
permit

one
question

undoubtedly

reply
winifred

and
you
will
answer
it
frankly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
now
for
it
,
"
think
the
woollen
-
draper
,
"
I
shall
,
at
least
,
ascertain
how
the
land
lies.--well
,
then
,
my

"
he
add
aloud
,
"
do
you
still
entertain
the
strong
attachment
you
do
to
Captain
Darrell
?
"
 
<EOS>
Winifred
's
cheek
glow
with
blush
,
and
fix
her
eye
,
which
flash
with
resentment

in
the
chamber
to
which
Thames

to

feeling
as
soon
as

meal

notwithstanding

upon

much
ado
to
maintain

self

command

<EOS>
His
wife

portrait
have

the
place

<EOS>
all
these
circumstances,--slight
in
themselves
,

powerful
in
their
effect,--touched
the
heart
of

consolation
in
affliction

queries,--Whether

his
unfortunate
mother

<EOS>
Her
eye

in
the
darkness
--
for
light

only
admit
through
a
small
grate
window
--
like
flame
,
and
,
as
she
fix
them
on
him
,
their
glance
seem
to
penetrate
his
very
soul
.
<EOS>
a
piece
of
old
blanket

across
her
shoulder

and
she
have
no
other
clothing

a
petticoat

<EOS>
Her

Her

around

Her
thin

the

fantastic

snatch

short

names,--the
work
of
its

of
its
present
inmate

<EOS>
when
Jack
enter
the
cell

she
be
talk
to
herself
in
the
muttering
unconnected
way
peculiar
to
her
distracted
condition

but
,
after
her
eye
have
rest
on
him
some
time
,
the
fix
expression

and
a
smile

<EOS>
this
smile
be
more
harrowing
even
than

rigid
look

"
You

with
a

beam

He

His

<EOS>
by
his

remarkably
stout

here

with
such

their
guest
as

<EOS>
beyond
the
hatch

angle

<EOS>
the
only
difference
between

<EOS>
I
be
stand
near
Jack
at
that
awful
moment

and
beheld
the
look
Wild
fix
on
him

<EOS>
It
be
like
the
grin
of
a
fiend

make
my
flesh

when

certain

Mr.

Ireton

wink
significantly

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mysterious
transaction
altogether
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
much
as
be
know
be
this
:
Captain
Darrell
,
who
reside
with
Mr.
Wood
at
Dollis
Hill
,
be
assault
and
half
-
kill
by
a
party
of
ruffian
,
head
,
he
swear
,
by
Mr.
Wild
,
and
his
uncle
,
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
,
however
,
prove
,
on
the
evidence
of
his
own
servant
,
that
he
be
at
the
Old
Bailey
at
the
time
;
and
Sir
Rowland
prove
that
_
he
_
be
in
Manchester
.
<EOS>
so
the
charge
be
dismiss
.
<EOS>
another
charge
be
then
bring
against
them
by
the
Captain
,
who
accuse
them
of
kidnap
him
when
a
boy
,
and
place
him
in
the
hand
of
a
dutch
skipper
,
name
Van
Galgebrok
,
with
instruction
to
throw
him
overboard
,
which
be
do
,
though
he
afterwards
escape
.
<EOS>
but
this
accusation
,
for
want
of
sufficient
evidence
,
meet
with
the
same
fate
as
the
first
,
and
Jonathan
come
off
victorious
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
,
however

if
the
skipper

_
have
be
find
,
that
the
result
of
the
case
would
have
be
materially
different
.
<EOS>
this
be
rather
too
much
to
expect
;
for
we
all
know
,
if
Mr.
Wild
wish
to
keep
a
man
out
of
the
way
,
he
will
speedily
find

<EOS>
Deathlike
,
indeed

be
the
repose

and
deep

Its

calmness
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
Her
lip
be
apart

but
no
breath
seem
to

from
them

and
,
but
for
a
slight

very
slight
palpitation
of

the
vital

<EOS>
this
lifeless
appearance
be
heighten
by
the
extreme
sharpness
of
her
feature

especially
the
nose
and
chin,--and
by
the
emaciation
of
her
limb
,
which
be
painfully
distinct
through
her
drapery
.
<EOS>
Her
attenuate
arm
be
cross
upon
her
breast

and
her
black
brow
and
eyelash

fearfully
with
the
livid
whiteness
of

<EOS>
Jonathan

and

that
,
after
a
slight
show
of
resistance
,
they
take
to
their
heel
,
leave
him
master
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
He
then
throw
open
the
door
of
the
vehicle
,
in
which
he
find
his
janizarie
with
their
arm
pinion
,
and
,
leap
into
it
,
order
the
man
to
drive
off
.
<EOS>
the
postilion
obey
,
and
dash
off
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
gallop
along
the
beautiful
road
lead
to
Neasdon
and
Willesden
,
just
as
the
serve
-
man
make
their
appearance

off
;
other

now
consider
a
remarkable
object

and
all
be
marvel
how
Jack
could

himself
through
such
a
narrow
aperture
,
until

them
by
Mr.

a
feat

or
any

impossible

on

him
go

<EOS>
there
be
something
in
Jonathan

manner

this
command

that
strike
the
man
as
singular

chamber

and
,
sit
down
,
appear
for
some
time
bury
in
reflection

<EOS>
the
dark
and
desperate
thought
that
be
pass
through
his
mind
at
this
time
will
presently
be
show

<EOS>
after
a
while
,
he
raise
his
eye
;
and
,
if
their
glance
could
have
be
witness
at
the
moment
,
it
could
not
have
be
easily
forget

<EOS>
mutter
something
to
himself
,
he
appear
to
be
tell
upon
his
finger
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
some
scheme
he
have
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
resolve
upon
its
execution
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
be
evident
from
his
saying
aloud,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
so
good
an
opportunity
may
never
occur
again

<EOS>
upon
this

hastily
backwards

He

<EOS>
lay
these
carefully
aside
,
he
restore
the
drawer
to
its
place

<EOS>
His
next
occupation
be
to
take
out
his
pistol
,
examine

priming
,
and
rub
the
flint
.
<EOS>
His
sword
then
come
in
for
his
scrutiny
:
he
feel
at
,
and
appear
satisfied
with
its
edge
.
<EOS>
this
employment
seem
to
afford
him
the
high
satisfaction
;
for
a
diabolical
grin
--
it
can
not

call
a
smile
--
play
upon
his
face
all
the
time
he
be

His

do
with
,
he
take
up
the
bludgeon
;
balance
it
in
his

;
upon
the
point
of
his

fall
with
a
smash

intentionally
,
upon
the
table

<EOS>
Beyond
be
a
narrow
bridge

cross
a
circular
building

at

<EOS>
this
door

<EOS>
as

bridge
,
he
hold
down
the
light
,
and
look
into
the
profound
abyss
.
<EOS>
the
red
glare
fall
upon
the
slimy
brick

and

the
echo
of
the
place
,
and
be
return
in
hollow
reverberation
.
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
a
loud
echo
here
presently
,
"
think
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
before
leave
the
place
he
look
upwards
,
and
could
just
discern
the
blue
vault
and
pale
star
of
Heaven
through
an
iron
grating
at
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
return
to

<EOS>
He

wrap
in
a
laced
roquelaure
,
which
he
throw
off
on
his
entrance
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
already
intimate
that
Jack
have
an
excessive
passion
for
finery
;
and
it
may
have
be
add
,
that
the
chief
part
of
his
ill

get
gain
be
devote
to
the
embellishment
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
,
he
appear
to
have
bestow
more
than
ordinary
attention
on
his
toilette
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
be
sumptuous
in
the
extreme
,
and
such
as
be
only

person
of
the
high
distinction
.
<EOS>
It

ruffle
of

,
and
so
ample
as
almost
to

the
tip
of
his
finger
;
and
a
silver

hilted
sword
.
<EOS>
this
costume

though
somewhat
extravagant
,
display
his
slight

but
perfectly

proportion
figure
to
the
great
advantage
.
<EOS>
the
only
departure
which
he
make
from
the
fashion
of
the
period
,
be
in
respect
to
the
peruke
--
an
article
he
could
never
be
induce
to
wear
.
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
it
,
he
still
adhere
to
the
sleek
black
crop
,
which
,
throughout
life
,
form
a
distinguishing
feature
in
his
appearance

<EOS>
ever
since
the

a

demeanour
and
look

which
be
so
much
refined
and
improve
that
he
could
scarcely

as
the

<EOS>
have
only

<EOS>
Blueskin

who
have

dog
Sir

taker
's
confidential
servant
,
Abraham
Mendez
,
and
not
by
the
regular
porter
,
there
be
little
doubt

they
be
alone
,

probably
make
some
arrangement
prior

<EOS>
now
,
if
as
I
suspect,--from
the
document
just
place
in
your

Rowland
meditate
do
you
justice
after
his
departure
<EOS>
,
it
be
possible
his
intention
may
be
frustrate
by
the
machination
of
Wild

whose
interest
be
obviously
to
prevent
such
an
occurrence
,
unless
we
can
surprise
them
together

,
by
prove
to
Sir
Rowland
that
we
possess
the
power
of
compel
a
restitution

force
the
other
treacherous

<EOS>
Jonathan

CHAPTER
XV
.
 
<EOS>
how

undergo
the
Peine
Forte
et
Dure

<EOS>
as
soon
as
it
become
know
,
through
the
medium
of
the
public
print
on
the
follow
day
,
that
Jack
Sheppard
have
break
out
of
prison
,
and
have
be
again
capture
during
the
night
,
fresh
curiosity
be
excited
,
and
large
crowd
than
ever
flock
to
Newgate
,
in
the
hope
of
obtain
admission
to
his
cell
;
but
by
the
governor
's
express
command
,
Wild
have
privately
counsel
the
step
,
no
one
be
allow
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
a
question
next
arise
whether
the
prisoner
could
be
execute
under
the
exist
warrant,--some
incline
to
one
opinion
,
some
to
another
.
<EOS>
to
settle
the
point
,
the
governor
start
to
Windsor
,
delegate
his
trust
in
the
interim
to
Wild
,
who
take
advantage
of
his
brief
rule
to
adopt
the
harsh
measure
towards
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
have
him
remove
from
the
Condemned
Hold
,
strip
of
his
fine
apparel
,
clothe
in
the
most
sordid
rag
,
load
with
additional
fetter
,
and
thrust
into
the
Stone
Hold,--already
describe
as
the
most
noisome
cell
in
the
whole
prison
.
<EOS>
here
,
without
a
glimpse
of
daylight
;
visit
by
no
one
except
Austin
at
state
interval
,
who
neither
answer
a
question
nor
address
a
word
to
him
;
feed
upon
the
bad
diet
,
literally
mouldy
bread
and
ditch
-
water
;
surround
by
stone
wall
;
with
a
flagged
floor
for
his
pillow
,
and
without
so
much
as
a
blanket
to
protect
him
from
the
death
-
like
cold
that
pierce
his
frame,--jack
's
stout
heart
be
subdue
,
and
he
fall
into
the
deep
dejection
,
ardently
long
for
the
time
when
even
a
violent
death
should
terminate
his
suffering
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
order
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pitt
return
with
intelligence
that
the
warrant
be
delay
,
and
,
on
take
the
opinion
of
two
eminent
lawyer
of
the
day
,
Sir
William
Thomson
and
Mr.
Serjeant
Raby
,
it
be
decide
that
it
must
be
prove
in
a
regular
and
judicial
manner
that
Sheppard
be
the
identical
person
who
have
be
convict
and
have
escape
,
before
a
fresh
order
could
be
make
for
his
execution
;
and
that
the
matter
must
,
therefore
,
stand
over
until
the
next
session
,
to
be
hold
at
the
Old
Bailey
in
October
,
when
it
could
be
bring
before
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
prisoner
,
meanwhile
,
who
be
not
inform
of
the
respite
,
languish
in
his
horrible
dungeon
,
and
,
at
the
expiration
of
three
week
,
become
so
seriously
indisposed
that
it
be
fear
he
could
not
long
survive
.
<EOS>
He
refuse
his
food,--and
even
when
well
provision
be
offer
him
,
reject
them
.
<EOS>
as
his
death
be
by
no
mean
what
Jonathan
desire
,
he
resolve
to
remove
him
to
a
more
airy
ward
,
and
afford
him
such
slight
comfort
as
may
tend
to
his
restoration
,
or
at
least
keep
him
alive
until
the
period
of
execution
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
Jack
be
carry
--
for
he
be
no
longer
able
to
move
without
assistance
--
to
a
ward
call
the
Castle
,
situate
over
the
gateway
on
the
western
side
,
in
what
be
consider
the
strong
part
of
the
jail
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
of
immense
thickness
;
the
small
window

unglazed

a
barrack

It

about
twelve

nine

fourteen

be

by
double
door
each
six

<EOS>
as

clothe

him
as

and
,
under
her
care
,
he
speedily
revive
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
become
convalescent
,
and
all
fear
of
his
premature
dissolution
be
at
an
end
,
Wild
recommence
his
rigorous
treatment
.
<EOS>
the
bedding
be
remove
;
Mrs.
Spurling
be
no
longer
allow
to
visit
him
;
he
be
again
load
with
iron
;
fasten
by
an
enormous
horse
-
padlock
to
a
staple
in
the
floor
;
and
only
allow
to
take
repose
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
a
single
blanket
constitute
his
sole
covering
at
night
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
this
,
he
grow
daily
better
and
strong
,
and
his
spirit
revive
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
no
visiter
have
be
permit
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
as
the
time
when
his
identity
have
to
be
prove
approach
,
this
rigour
be
,
in
a
trifling
degree
,
relaxed
,
and
a
few
person
be
occasionally
admit
to
the
ward
,
but
only
in
the
presence
of
Austin
.
<EOS>
from
none
of
these
could
Jack
ascertain
what
have
become
of
Thames
,
or
learn
any
particular
concern
the
family
at
Dollis
Hill
,
or
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
Austin
,
who
have
be
evidently
school
by
Wild
,
maintain
a
profound
silence
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
more
than
a
month
pass
over
.
<EOS>
October
arrive
;
and
in
another
week
the
court
would
be
sit
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
,
about
this
time
,
just
as
Austin
be
about
to
lock
the
great
gate
,
Jonathan
Wild
and
his
two
janizarie
enter
the
Lodge
with
a
prisoner
bind
hand
and
foot
.
<EOS>
It
be
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
on
the
cord
be
remove
,
he
make
a
desperate
spring
at
Wild
,
bore
him
to
the
ground
,
clutch
at
his
throat
,
and
would
,
infallibly
,
have
strangle
him
,
if
the
keeper
have
not
all
throw
themselves
upon
him
,
and
by
main
force
tear
him
off
.
<EOS>
His
struggle
be
so
violent
,
that
,
be
a
man
of
tremendous
strength
,
it
be
some
time
before
they
could
master
him
,
and
it
require
the
combine
effort
of
all
the
four
partner
to
put
him
into
iron
.
<EOS>
It
appear
from
what
he
say
that
he
have
be
capture
when
asleep,--that
his
liquor
have
be
drugged,--otherwise
,
he
would
never
have
allow
himself
to
be
take
alive
.
<EOS>
wild
,
he
assert
,
have
rob
him
of
a
large
sum
of
money
,
and
till
it
be
restore
he
would
never

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Jonathan

to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Blueskin

,
Wild
intimate
his
intention
of
visit
the
Castle

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
the
massive
door
be
unlock

and
they
enter
the
cell
.
<EOS>
what
be
their
surprise
to
find
it
vacant
,
and
the
prisoner
go
!
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
could
scarcely
believe
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
look
fiercely
and
inquiringly
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
companion
;
but
,
though
both
of
them
be
excessively
frightened
,
neither
appear
guilty
.
<EOS>
before
a
word
could
be
say
,
however
,
a
slight
noise
be
hear
in
the
chimney
,
and
Jack
with
his
iron
on
descend
from
it
.
<EOS>
without
betray
the
slight
confusion
,
or
make
a
single
remark
,
he
quietly
resume
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amazement
!
"
cry
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
how
have
he
unfasten
his
padlock
?
<EOS>
Austin
,
it
must
be
owing
to
your
negligence

<EOS>
"
My

with

bitter
imprecation

<EOS>
"
He
be
not
to
blame
,
"
say
Jack
,
rise
.
<EOS>
"
I
open
the
padlock
with
this
crooked
nail
,
which
I
find
in

floor

<EOS>
if

arrive
ten
minute
later

go

bring
another
padlock
of
the
large
size

the
heavy
handcuff
they
can
find

<EOS>
We
will
try
whether

will
get
loose
again

"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
say
nothing
,
but
a
disdainful
smile
curl
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
Austin
depart
,
and
presently
afterwards
return
with
the
two
subordinate
officer
,
each
of
whom
wear
a
leathern
apron
round
his
waist
,
and
carry
a
large
hammer

<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
manacle
be
slip
over
the
prisoner

wrist
,
and
the
new
padlock
secure
to
the
staple
,
they
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
"
leave
me
alone
with
him
a
moment
,
"
say
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
and
the
jailer
also
retire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
say
Wild
,
with
a
glance
of
malignant
triumph
,
"
I
will
now
tell
you
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
all
my
plan
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
before
a
month
have
elapse
,
your
mother
will
be
mine

<EOS>
the
Trenchard
estate
will
likewise
be
mine
,
for
Sir
Rowland
be
no
more

and
the
youth
,
Thames
,
will
never

<EOS>
Blueskin
,
who
have
evade
me
with
the
paper

the
money
,
be
a
prisoner
here
,
and
will
perish
on
the
same
gallow
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
vengeance
be
completely
gratified
.
"
 
<EOS>
without
wait
for
a
reply
,
but
dart
a
malevolent
look
at
the
prisoner
,
he
quit
the
cell
,
the
door
of
which
be
instantly
double
-
lock
and
bolt

<EOS>
"
I
have
not
quite
do
yet

"
say
Jonathan
,
as
he
join
the
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
whether
Blueskin
be
a
little
more
composed
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
question
to
ask
him
.
<EOS>
give
me
the
key
and
the
light
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
descend
a
short
spiral
staircase
,
and
,
enter
a
long
stone
gallery
,
from
which
several
other
passage
branch
,
take
one
of
them
,
and
after
various
turning
--
for
he
be
familiar
with
all
the
intricacy
of
the
prison
--
arrive
at
the
cell
of
which
he
be
in
search

<EOS>
select
a
key
from
the
heavy
bunch
commit
to
him
by
Austin
,
he
throw
open
the
door
,
and
behold
Blueskin
seat
at
the
back
of
the
small
chamber
,
handcuff
,
and
<EOS>
with
his
foot
confine
in
a
heavy
pair
of
stock
.
<EOS>
He
be
asleep
when
Jonathan
enter
,
and
growl
at
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
soon
as
he
perceive
who
it
be
,
he
rouse
himself
,
and
glare
fiercely
at
the
intruder
from
under
his
bent
brow
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
,
in
a
gruff
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
what
you

gold

the
paper

take
away
from

"
rejoin
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
never
know
more
than
this
,
"
retort
Blueskin
,
with
a
grin
of
satisfaction;--"they're
in
a
place
of
safety
,
where
_

never
find

<EOS>
"
hear

Blueskin

say
Jonathan
,
restrain
his
choler
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
tell
me
where
to

for
these
thing
,
and
I

I
will

you
free

<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will

rejoin
the
other

"
<EOS>
Set
Captain
Sheppard
free
,
and
when
I
hear
he
be
<EOS>
safe,--not
before,--I'll
put
the
money
and
paper
into
your
possession
,
and
some
other
matter
,
too
,
that
you
know
nothing

<EOS>
"
impracticable

exclaim
Jonathan

furiously

"

no

I

<EOS>
so

violently
shut

He

may
sound
somewhat
tame
by
the
side
of
the
glowing
account
give
of
him

assert
that

all
I

it
may
,
possibly
,
convey
a
more
accurate

James

His
imperturbable
demeanour
in

His

his

despair

panic

He
have
a
peculiar
way
of
step
in

in
a
parry

know
his

put
a

that

never

He

that

have
no
music

the
good
old
ballad
tune

we
will
see

disgraceful

will

dejectedly

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
Iron
Bar
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
's
first
object
be
to
free
himself
from
his
handcuff
.
<EOS>
this
he
accomplish
by
hold
the
chain
that
connect
them
firmly
between
his
tooth
,
and
squeeze
his
finger
as
closely
together
as
possible
,
succeed
in
draw
his
wrist
through
the
manacle
.
<EOS>
He
next
twist
the
heavy
gyve
round
and
round
,
and
partly
by
main
strength
,
partly
by
a
dexterous
and
well
-
apply
jerk
,
sap
asunder
the
central
link
by
which
they
be
attach
to
the
padlock
.
<EOS>
take
off
his
stocking
,
he
then
draw
up
the
basil
as
far
as
he
be
able
,
and
tie
the
fragment
of
the
broken
chain
to
his
leg
,
to
prevent
them
from
clank
,
and
impede
his
future
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
former
attempt
to
pass
up
the
chimney
,
it
may
be
remember
,
be
obstruct
by
an
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
to
remove
this
obstacle
it
be
necessary
make
an
extensive
breach
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
with
the
broken
link
of
the
chain
,
which
serve
him
in
lieu
of
more
efficient
implement
,
he
commence
operation
just
above
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
soon
contrive
to
pick
a
hole
in
the
plaster
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
the
wall
,
as
he
suspect
,
solidly
construct
of
brick
and
stone
;
and
with
the
slight
and
inadequate
tool
which
he
possess
,
it
be
a
work
of
infinite
labour
and
skill
to
get
out
a
single
brick
.
<EOS>
that
do
,
however
,
he
be
well
aware
the
rest
would
be
comparatively
easy
,
and
as
he
throw
the
brick
to
the
ground
,
he
exclaim
triumphantly
,
"
the
first
step
be
take
--
the
main
difficulty
be
overcome
.
"
 
<EOS>
animate
by
this
trifling
success
,
he
proceed
with
fresh
ardour
,
and
the
rapidity
of
his
progress
be
proclaim
by
the
heap
of
brick
,
stone
,
and
mortar
which
before
long
cover
the
floor
.
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
an
hour
,
by
dint
of
unremitte
exertion
,
he
have
make
so
large
a
breach
in
the
chimney
,
that
he
could
stand
upright
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
within
a
foot
of
the
bar
,
and
introduce
himself
into
the
hole
,
speedily
work
his
way
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
regardless
of
the
risk
he
incur
from
some
heavy
stone
drop
on
his
head
or
feet,--regardless
also
of
the
noise
make
by
the
fall
rubbish
,
and
of
the
imminent
danger
which
he
consequently
run
of
be
interrupt
by
some
of
the
jailer
,
should
the
sound
reach
their
ear
,
he
continue
to
pull
down
large
masse
of
the
wall
,
which
he
fling
upon
the
floor
of
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
have
work
thus
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
without
be
sensible
of
fatigue
,
though
he
be
half
stifle
by
the
cloud
of
dust
which
his
exertion
raise
,
he
have
make
a
hole
about
three
foot
wide
,
and
six
high
,
and
uncover
the
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
grasp
it
firmly
with
both
hand
,
he
quickly
wrench
if
from
the
stone
in
which
it
be
mortise
,
and
leapt
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
on
examination
it
prove
to
be
a
flat
bar
of
iron
,
nearly
a
yard
in
length
,
and
more
than
an
inch
square
.
"
<EOS>
a
capital
instrument
for
my
purpose
<EOS>
,
"
think
Jack
,
shoulder
it
,
"
and
worth
all
the
trouble
I
have
have
in
procure
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
muse
,
he
fancy
he
hear
the
lock
try
.
<EOS>
a
chill
run
through
his
frame
,
and
,
grasp
the
heavy
weapon
with
which
chance
have
provide
him
,
prepared
to
strike
down
the
first
person
who
should
enter
the
cell
.
<EOS>
after
listen
attentively
for
a
short
time
without
draw
breath
,
he
become
convinced
that
his
apprehension
be
groundless
,
and
,
greatly
relieved
,
sit
down
upon
the
chair
to
rest
himself
and
prepare
for
further
effort
.
 
<EOS>
acquaint
with
every
part
of
the
jail
,
Jack
well
know
that
his
only
chance
of
effect
an
escape
must
be
by
the
roof
.
<EOS>
to
reach
it
would
be
a
most
difficult
undertaking
.
<EOS>
still
it
be
possible
,
and
the
difficulty
be
only
a
fresh
incitement
.
 
<EOS>
the
mere
enumeration
of
the
obstacle
that
exist
would
have
deter
any
spirit
less
daring
than
Sheppard
's
from
even
hazard
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
independently
of
other
risk
,
and
of
the
chance
of
break
his
neck
in
the
descent
,
he
be
aware
that
to
reach
the
lead
he
should
have
to
break
open
six
of
the
strong
door
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
Armed
,
however
,
with
the
implement
he
have
so
fortunately
obtain
,
he
do
not
despair
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
will
only
be
remember
as
that
of
a
robber
,
"
he
muse
;
"
but
it
shall
be
remember
as
that
of
a
bold
one
:
and
<EOS>
this
night
's
achievement
,
if
it
do
nothing
else
,
shall
prevent
me
from
be
class
with
the
common
herd
of
depredator
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
rouse
by
this
reflection
,
fill
with
the
deep
anxiety
for
his
mother
,
and
burn
to
be
avenge
upon
Jonathan
Wild
,
he
grasp
the
iron
bar
,
which
,
when
he
sit
down
,
he
have
lay
upon
his
knee
,
and
step
quickly
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
he
have
to
clamber
up
the
immense
heap
of
brick
and
rubbish
which
now
litter
the
floor
,
amount
almost
to
a
car
-
load
,
and
reach
up
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
"
Austin
will
stare
,
"
think
Jack
,
"
when
he
come
here
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
will
cost
them
something
to
repair
their
stronghold
,
and
take
them
more
time
to
build
it
up
again
than
I
have
take
to
pull
it
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
before
proceed
with
his
task
,
he
consider
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
barricade
the
door
;
but
,
reflect
that
the
bar
would
be
an
indispensable
assistant
in
his
further
effort
,
he
abandon
the
idea
,
and
determine
to
rely
implicitly
on
that
good
fortune
which
have
hitherto
attend
him
on
similar
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
have
once
more
get
into
the
chimney
,
he
climb
to
a
level
with
the
ward
above
,
and
recommence
operation
as
vigorously
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
aid
with
a
powerful
implement
,
with
which
he
soon
contrive
to
make
a
hole
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
every
brick
I
take
out
,
"
cry
Jack
,
as
fresh
rubbish
clatter
down
the
chimney
,

colour

all
trace
of
which
have
,
however

long

disappear

like
the
Castle

which
it
resemble
in

that
it

the
Red
Room

by

Preston
rebel

<EOS>
have
make
a
hole
in
the
wall
sufficiently
large
to
pass
through
,
Jack
first
toss
the
bar
into
the
room
and
then
creep
after
it

as
soon
as
he
have
gain
his
foot
,
he
glance
round
the
bare
blank
wall
of
the
cell
,

,
oppress
by
the
musty
,
close
atmosphere
,
exclaim
,
<EOS>
"
I
will
let
a
little
fresh
air
into
this
dungeon

<EOS>
They
say
it
have
not
be
open
for
eight
year
--
but
I
will
not
be
eight
year
in
get
out
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
step
across
the
room
,
some
sharp
point
in
the
floor
pierce
his
foot
,
and
stoop
to
examine
it
<EOS>
,
he
find
that
the
wound
have
be
inflict
by
a
long
rusty
nail
,
which
project
from
the
board

totally
disregard
the
pain
,
he
pick
up
the
nail
,
and
reserve
it
for
future
use
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
long
in
make
it
available
.
 
<EOS>
on
examine
the
door
,
he
find
it
secure
by
a
large
rusty
lock
,
which
he
endeavour
to
pick
with
the
nail
he
have
just
acquire
;
but
all
his
effort
prove
ineffectual
,
he
remove
the
plate
that
cover
it
with
the
bar
,
and
with
his
finger
contrive
to
draw
back
the
bolt
.
 
<EOS>
open
the
door
he
then
step
into
a
dark
narrow
passage
lead
,
as
he
be
well
aware
,
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
there
be
door
communicate
with
the
King
's
Bench
Ward
and
the
Stone
Ward
,
two
large
hold
on
the
Master
Debtors
'
side
.
<EOS>
but
Jack
be
too
well
verse
in
the
geography
of
the
place
to
attempt
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
he
have
be
ignorant
of
it
,
the
sound
of
voice
which
he
could
faintly
distinguish
,
would
have
serve
as
a
caution
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
hurry
on
,
his
progress
be
soon
check
by
a
strong
door
,
several
inch
in
thickness
,
and
nearly
as
wide
as
the
passage
.
<EOS>
run
his
hand
carefully
over
it
in
search
of
the
lock
,
he
perceive
to
his
dismay
that
it
be
fasten
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
after
several
vain
attempt
to
burst
it
open
,
he
resolve
,
as
a
last
alternative
,
to
break
through
the
wall
in
the
part
near
to
the
lock
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
much
more
serious
task
than
he
anticipate
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
of
considerable
thickness
,
and
build
altogether
of
stone
;
and
the
noise
he
be
compel
to
make
in
use
the
heavy
bar
,
which
bring
spark
with
every
splinter
he
strike
off
,
be
so
great
,
that
he
fear
it
must
be
hear
by
the
prisoner
on
the
debtor
'
side

<EOS>
heedless
,
however
,
of
the
consequence
,
he
pursue
his
task
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
's
labour
,
during
which
he
be
oblige
more
than
once
to
pause
to
regain
breath
,
suffice
to
make
a
hole
wide
enough
to
allow
a
passage
for
his
arm
up
to
the
elbow
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
he
be
able
to
force
back
a
ponderous
bolt
from
its
socket
;
and
to
his
unspeakable
joy
,
find
that
the

instantly
yield

It
be
deny
him
,
for
as
he
close
his
eye
--
though
but
for
an
instant
--
the
whole
scene
of
his
former
visit
to
the
place
rise
before
him
.
<EOS>
there
he
sit
as
before
,
with
the
heavy
fetter
on
his
limb
,
and
beside
him
sit
his
three
companion
,
who
have
since
expiate
their
offence
on
the
gibbet
.
<EOS>
the
chapel
be
again
crowd
with
visitor
,
and
every
eye
--
even
that
of
Jonathan
Wild
who
have
come
thither
to
deride
him,--was
fix
upon
him
.
<EOS>
so
perfect
be
the
illusion
,
that
he
could
almost
fancy
<EOS>
he
hear
the
solemn
voice
of
the
ordinary
warning
him
that
his
race
be
nearly
run
,
and
implore
him
to
prepare
for
eternity
.
<EOS>
from
this
perturbed
state
he
be
rouse
by
thought
of
his
mother
,
and
fancy
he
hear
her
gentle
voice
urge
him
on
to
fresh
exertion
,
he
start
up
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
side
of
the
chapel
there
be
a
large
grate
window
,
but
,
as
it
look
upon
the
interior
of
the
jail
,
Jack
prefer
follow
the
course
he
have
originally
decide
upon
to
make
any
attempt
in
this
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
proceed
to
a
gate
which
stand
upon
the
south
,
and
guard
the
passage
communicate
with
the
lead
.
<EOS>
It
be
grate
and
crest
with
spike
,
like
that
he
have
just
burst
open
,
and
think
it
a
needless
waste
of
time
to
force
it
,
he
break
off
one
of
the
spike
,
which
he
carry
with
him
for
further
purpose
,
and
then
climb
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
short
flight
of
step
bring
him
to
a
dark
passage
,
into
which
he
plunge
.
<EOS>
here
he
find
another
strong
door
,
make
the
fifth
he
have
encounter
.
<EOS>
well
aware
that
the
door
in
this
passage
be
much
strong
than
those
in
the
entry
he
have
just
quit
he
be
neither
surprised
nor
dismay
to
find
it
fasten
by
a
lock
of
unusual
size
.
<EOS>
after
repeatedly
try
to
remove
the
plate
,
which
be
so
firmly
screw
down
that
it
resist
all
his
effort
,
and
vainly
attempt
to
pick
it
with
the
spike
and
nail
;
he
,
at
length
,
after
half
an
hour
's
ineffectual
labour
,
wrench
off
the
box
by
mean
of
the
iron
bar
,
and
the
door
,
as
he
laughingly
express
it
,
"
become
his
humble
servant
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
this
difficulty
be
only
overcome
to
be
succeed
by
one
still
great
.
<EOS>
hasten
along
the
passage
he
come
to
the
sixth
door
.
<EOS>
for
this
he
be
prepared
;
but
he
be
not
prepare
for
the
almost
insurmountable
obstacle
which
it
present
.
<EOS>
run
his
hand
hastily
over
it
,
he
be
startled
to
find
it
one
complicated
mass
of
bolt
and
bar
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
all
the
precaution
previously
take
be
here
accumulate
.
<EOS>
any
one
less
courageous
than
himself
would
have
abandon
the
attempt
from
a
conviction
of
its
utter
hopelessness
;
but
,
though
it
may
for
a
moment
damp
his
ardour
,
it
could
not
deter
him
.
 
<EOS>
once
again
,
he
pass
his
hand
over
the
surface
and
carefully
note
all
the
obstacle
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
lock
,
apparently
more
than
a
foot
wide
,
strongly
plate
,
and
gird
to
the
door
with
thick
iron
hoop
.
<EOS>
below
it
a
prodigiously
large
bolt
be
shoot
into
the
socket
,
and
,
in
order
to
keep
it
there
,
be
fasten
by
a
hasp
,
and
further
protect
by
an
immense
padlock
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
the
door
be
cross
and
recrosse
by
iron
bar
,
clench
by
broad
-
head
nail
.
<EOS>
an
iron
fillet
secure
the
socket
of
the
bolt
and
the
box
of
the
lock
to
the
main
post
of
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
dishearten
by
this
survey
,
Jack
set
to
work
upon
the
lock
,
which
he
attack
with
all
his
implements;--now
attempt
to
pick
it
with
the
nail;--now
to
wrench
it
off
with
the
bar
:
but
all
without
effect
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
fail
in
make
any
impression
,
but
seem
to
increase
the
difficulty
,
for
after
an
hour
's
toil
he
have
break
the
nail
and
slightly
bend
the
iron
bar
.
 
<EOS>
completely
overcome
by
fatigue
,
with
strained
muscle
,
and
bruise
hand
;
stream
with
perspiration
,
and
with
lip
so
parched
that
he
would
gladly
have
part
with
a
treasure
if
he
have
possess
it
for
a
draught
of
water
;
he
sink
against
the
wall
,
and
while
in
this
state
be
seize
with
,
a
sudden
and
strange
alarm
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
the
turnkey
have
discover
his
flight
and
be
in
pursuit
of
him,--that
<EOS>
they
have
climb
up
the
chimney,--entered
<EOS>
the
Red
room,--tracke
him
from
door
to
door
,
and
be
now
only
detain
by
the
gate
which
he
have
leave
unbroken
in
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
He
even
think
he
could
detect
the
voice
of
Jonathan
,
urge
and
direct
them
.
 
<EOS>
so
strongly
be
he
impressed
with
this
idea
,
that
grasp
the
iron
bar
with
both
hand
,
he
dash
it
furiously
against
the
door
,
make
the
passage
echo
with
the
blow
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
his
fear
vanish
,
and
hear
nothing
,
he
grow
calm
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
revive
,
and
encourage
himself
with
the
idea
that
the
present
impediment
,
though
the
great
,
be
the
last
,
he
set
himself
seriously
to
consider
how
it
may
best
be
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
on
reflection
,
it
occur
to
him
that
he
may
,
perhaps
,
be
able
to
loosen
the
iron
fillet
;
a
notion
no
sooner
conceive
than
execute
.
<EOS>
with
incredible
labour
,
and
by
the
aid
of
both
spike
and
nail
,
he
succeed
in
get
the
point
of
the
bar
beneath
the
fillet
.
<EOS>
exert
all
his
energy
,
and
use
the
bar
as
a
lever
,
he
force
off
the
iron
band
,
which
be
full
seven
foot
high
,
seven
inch
wide
,
and
two
thick
,
and
which
bring
with
it
in
its
fall
the
box
of
the
lock
and
the
socket
of
the
bolt
,
leave
no
further
hinderance
.
 
<EOS>
overjoy
beyond
measure
at
have
vanquish
this
apparently
-
insurmountable
obstacle
,
Jack
dart
through
the
door
.

CHAPTER
XX
.
 
<EOS>
the
Leads
.
  
<EOS>
ascend
a
short
flight
of
step
,
Jack
find
at
the
summit
a
door
,
which
be
bolt
in
the
inside
he
speedily
open
.
 
<EOS>
the
fresh
air
,
which
blow
in
his
face
,
greatly
revive
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
reach
what
be
call
the
low
leads,--a
flat
,
cover
a
part
of
the
prison
contiguous
to
the
gateway
,
and
surround
on
all
side
by
wall
about
fourteen
foot
high
.
<EOS>
on
the
north
stand
the
battlement
of
one
of
the
tower
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
on
this
side
a
flight
of
wooden
step
,
protect
by
a
hand
-
rail
,
lead
to
a
door
opening
upon
the
summit
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
this
door
be
crest
with
spike
,
and
guard
on
the
right
by
a
bristling
semicircle
of
spike
.
<EOS>
hastily
ascend
these
step
,
Jack
find
the
door
,
as
he
anticipate
,
lock
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
easily
force
it
,
but
prefer
a
more
expeditious
mode
of
reach
the
roof
which
suggest
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
mount
the
door
he
have
last
open
,
he
place
his
hand
on
the
wall
above
,
and
quickly
draw
himself
up
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
he
get
on
the
roof
of
the
prison
,
St.
Sepulchre
's
clock
strike
eight
.
<EOS>
It
be
instantly
answer
by
the
deep
note
of
St.
Paul
's
;
and
the
concert
be
prolong
by
other
neighbouring
church
.
<EOS>
Jack
have
thus
be
six
hour
in
accomplish
his
arduous
task
.
 
<EOS>
though
nearly
dark
,
there
be
still
light
enough
leave
to
enable
him
to
discern
surround
object
.
<EOS>
through
the
gloom
he
distinctly
perceive
the
dome
of
St.
Paul
's
,
hang
like
a
black
cloud
in
the
air
;
and
near
to
him
he
remark
the
golden
ball
on
the
summit
of
the
College
of
Physicians
,
compare
by
Garth
to
a
"
gilded
pill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
other
tower
and
spire
--
St
.
<EOS>
Martin
's
on
Ludgate
-
hill
,
and
Christchurch
in
Newgate
Street
,
be
also
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
as
he
gaze
down
into
the
court
of
the
prison
,
he
could
not
help
shudder
,
lest
a
false
step
may
precipitate
him
below
.
 
<EOS>
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
any
such
escape
as
that
just
describe
,
it
be
deem
expedient
,
in
more
recent
time
,
to
keep
a
watchman
at
the
top
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
not
many
year
ago
,
two
man
,
employ
on
this
duty
,
quarrel
during
the
night
,
and
in
the
morning
their
body
be
find
stretch
upon
the
pavement
of
the
yard
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
proceed
along
the
wall
,
Jack
reach
the
southern
tower
,
over
the
battlement
of
which
he
clamber
,
and
cross
it
,
drop
upon
the
roof
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
He
then
scale
the
northern
tower
,
and
make
his
way
to
the
summit
of
that
part
of
the
prison
which
front
Giltspur
Street
.
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
extremity
of
the
building
,
he
find
that
it
overlook
the
flat
-
roof
of
a
house
which
,
as
far
as
he
could
judge
in
the
darkness
,
lie
at
a
depth
of
about
twenty
foot
below
.
 
<EOS>
not
choose
to
hazard
so
great
<EOS>
a
fall
,
Jack
turn
to
examine
the
building
,
to
see
whether
any
more
favourable
point
of
descent
present
itself
,
but
could
discover
nothing
but
steep
wall
,
without
a
single
available
projection
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
around
,
he
behold
an
incessant
stream
of
passenger
hurry
on
below
.
<EOS>
light
glimmer
in
the
window
of
the
different
house
;
and
a
lamp
-
lighter
be
run
from
post
to
post
on
his
way
to
Snow
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
find
it
impossible
to
descend
on
any
side
,
without
incur
serious
risk
,
Jack
resolve
to
return
for
his
blanket
,
by
the
help
of
which
he
feel
certain
of
accomplish
a
safe
landing
on
the
roof
of
the
house
in
Giltspur
Street
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
begin
to
retrace
his
step
,
and
pursue
the
course
he
have
recently
take
,
scale
the
two
tower
,
and
pass
along
the
wall
of
the
prison
,
he
descend
by
mean
of
the
door
upon
the
Lower
Leads
.
<EOS>
before
he
re
-
enter
the
prison
,
he
hesitate
from
a
doubt
whether
he
be
not
fearfully
increase
his
risk
of
capture
;
but
,
convince
that
he
have
no
other
alternative
,
he
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
,
he
have
never
quit
the
iron
bar
,
and
he
now
grasp
it
with
the
firm
determination
of
sell
his
life
dearly
,
if
he
meet
with
any
opposition
.
<EOS>
a
few
second
suffice
to
clear
the
passage
,
through
which
it
have
previously
cost
him
more
than
two
hour
to
force
his
way
.
<EOS>
the
floor
be
strew
with
screw
,
nail
,
fragment
of
wood
and
stone
,
and
across
the
passage
lie
the
heavy
iron
fillet
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
disturb
any
of
this
litter
,
but
leave
it
as
a
mark
of
his
prowess
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
at
the
entrance
of
the
chapel
,
and
strike
the
door
over
which
he
have
previously
climb
a
violent
blow
with
the
bar
,
it
fly
open
.
<EOS>
to
vault
over
the
pews
be
the
work
of
a
moment
;
and
have
gain
the
entry
lead
to
the
Red
Room
he
pass
through
the
first
door
;
his
progress
be
only
impede
by
the
pile
of
broken
stone
,
which
he
himself
have
raise
.
 
<EOS>
listen
at
one
of
the
door
lead
to
the
Master
Debtors
'
side
,
he
hear
a
loud
voice
chant
a
bacchanalian
melody
,
and
the
boisterous
laughter
that
accompany
the
song
,
convince
him
that
no
suspicion
be
entertain
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
enter
the
Red
Room
,
he
creep
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
,
descend
the
chimney
,
and
arrive
once
more
in
his
old
place
of
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
how
different
be
his
present
feeling
compare
with
those
he
have
experience
on
quit
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
then
_
,
though
full
of
confidence
,
he
half
doubt
his
power
of
accomplish
his
design
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
,
he
_
have
_
achieve
them
,
and
feel
assure
of
success
.
<EOS>
the
vast
heap
of
rubbish
on
the
floor
have
be
so
materially
increase
by
the
brick
and
plaster
throw
down
in
his
attack
upon
the
wall
of
the
Red
Room
,
that
it
be
with
some
difficulty
he
could
find
the
blanket
which
be
almost
bury
beneath
the
pile
.
<EOS>
He
next
search
for
his
stocking
and
shoe
,
and
when
find
,
put
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
employ
,
his
nerve
undergo
a
severe
shock
.
<EOS>
a
few
brick
,
dislodge
probably
by
his
last
descent
,
come
clatter
down
the
chimney
,
and
as
it
be
perfectly
dark
,
give
him
the
notion
that
some
one
be
endeavour
to
force
an
entrance
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
fear
,
like
those
he
have
recently
experience
,
speedily
vanish
,
and
he
prepare
to
return
to
the
roof
,
congratulate
himself
that
owe
to
the
opportune
falling
of
the
brick
,
he
have
in
all
probability
escape
serious
injury
.
 
<EOS>
throw
the
blanket
over
his
left
arm
and
shoulder
the
iron
bar
,
he
again
clamber
up
the
chimney
;
regain

and
,
in
less
than
ten
minute
after
quit
the
Castle
,
have
reach
the
northern
extremity
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
previously
to
his
descent
he
have
leave
the
nail
and
spike
on
the
wall
,
and
with
these
he
fasten
the
blanket
to
the
stone
cope
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
let
himself
carefully
down
by
it
,
and
have
only
a
few
foot
to
drop
,
alight
in
safety
.

the
second
time
,
with
a
heart
throb
with
exultation

to
make

<EOS>
to
his
great
joy
he
find
a
small
garret

door
in
the
roof
of
the
opposite
house

<EOS>
He
enter
it
;
cross
the
room
,
in
which
there

here

Captivity

a
striking
alteration
in
Thames

He
look

hollow

his

unshorn

nothing
could
be

Thames
comply

<EOS>
the
uproar

barking,--but
<EOS>
above

the
stentorian
voice
of
Jonathan
,
urge
them
on
.
<EOS>
Jack
be
so
harrasse
that
he
feel
half
inclined
to
stand
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
strain
every
sinew
,
his
foot
slip
,
and
he
fall
,
head
foremost
,
into
a
deep
trench
,
which
he
have
not

in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
this
fall

him
,
for
the
horseman

over

.
<EOS>
creep
along
quickly
on
his
hand
and
knee
,
he
find
the
entrance
to
a
covered
drain
,
into
which
he
creep
.
<EOS>
He
be
scarcely
conceal
when
he
hear
the
horseman
,
who
perceive
they
have
overshot
their
mark
,
ride
back
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Jonathan
and
the
vast
mob
attend
him
,
have
come
up
,
and
the
place
be
render
almost
as
light
as
day
by
the
link
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
somewhere
hereabouts
,
"
cry
one
of
the
horseman
,
dismount
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
close
upon
him
when
he
suddenly
disappear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
make
no
answer
,
but
snatch
a
torch
from
a
bystander
,
jump
into
the
trench
and
commence
a
diligent
search
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
have
arrive
at
the
mouth
of
the
drain
,
and
Jack
feel
certain
he
must
be
discover
,
a
loud
shout
be
raise
from
the
further
end
of
the
field
that
the
fugitive
be
catch
.
<EOS>
all
the
assemblage
,
accompany
by
Jonathan
,
set
off
in
this
direction
,
when
it
turn
out
that
the
supposed
housebreaker
be
a
harmless
beggar
,
who
have
be
find
asleep
under
a
hedge
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
's
vexation
at
the
disappointment
be
express
in
the
bitter
imprecation
,
and
he
return
as
speedily
as
he
could
to
the
trench
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
now
lose
the
precise
spot
;
and
think
he
have
examine
the
drain
,
turn
his
attention
to
another
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
excitement
of
the
chase
have
in
some
degree
subside
.
<EOS>
the
crowd
disperse
in
different
direction
,
and
most
fortunately
a
heavy
shower
come
on
,
put
them
altogether
to
flight
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
still
linger
.
<EOS>
He
seem
wholly
insensible
to
the
rain
,
though
it
presently
descend
in
torrent
,
and
continue
his
search
as
ardently
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
after
occupy
himself
thus
for
the
good
part
of
an
hour
,
he
think
Jack
must
have
give
him
the
slip
.
<EOS>
still
,
his
suspicion
be
so
strong
,
that
he
order
Mendez
to
remain
on
guard
near
the
spot
all
night
,
and
,
by
the
promise
of
a
large
reward
induce
two
other
man
to
keep
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
take
his
departure
,
he
whisper
to
the
Jew
:
"
take
him
dead
or
alive
;
but
if
we
fail
now
,
and
you
hear
him
aright
in
Seacoal
Lane
,
we
be
sure
of
him
at
his
mother
's
funeral
on
Sunday
.

CHAPTER
XXV
.
 
<EOS>
how
Jack
Sheppard
get
rid
of
his
Irons
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
after
this
,
Jack
venture
to
emerge
from
his
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
rain
heavily
,
and
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
drench
to
the
skin,--in
fact
,
he
have
be
lie
in
a
bed
of
muddy
water,--and
chill
to
the
very
bone
<EOS>
,
he
feel
so
stiff
,
that
he
could
scarcely
move
.
 
<EOS>
listen
attentively
,
he
fancy
he
hear
the
breathing
of
some
one
near
him
,
and
move
cautiously
in
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
care
,
he
come
in
contact
with
a
man
,
who
,
endeavour
to
grasp
him
,
cry
,
in
the
voice
of
Mendez
,
"
who
go
dere
?
<EOS>
shpeak
!
<EOS>
or
I
fire
!
"
 
<EOS>
no
answer
be
return
,
the
Jew
instantly
discharge
his
pistol
,
and
though
the
shot
do
no
damage
,
the
flash
discover
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
next
moment
all
be
profound
darkness
,
Jack
easily
manage
to
break
away
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
without
an
idea
where
he
be
go
,
Jack
pursue
his
way
through
the
field
;
and
,
as
he
proceed
,
the
numbness
of
his
limb
in
some
degree
wear
off
,
and
his
confidence
return
.
<EOS>
He
have
need
of
all
the
inexhaustible
energy
of
his
character
to
support
him
through
his
toilsome
walk
over
the
wet
grass
,
or
along
the
slippery
ploughed
land
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
get
into
a
lane
,
but
have
not
proceed
far
when
he
be
again
alarm
by
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
tread
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
break
through
the
hedge
he
take
to
the
field
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
almost
drive
to
despair
.
<EOS>
Wet
as
he
be
,
he
feel
if
he
lie
down
in
the
grass
,
he
should
perish
with
cold
;
while
,
if
he
seek
a
night
's
lodging
in
any
asylum
,
his
dress
,
stain
with
blood
and
cover
with
dirt
,
would
infallibly
cause
him
to
be
secure
and
deliver
into
the
hand
of
justice
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
fetter
,
which
be
still
upon
his
legs:--how
be
he
to
get
rid
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
tired
and
dispirit
,
he
still
wander
on
.
<EOS>
again
return
to
the
main
road
,
he
pass
through
Clapton
;
and
turn
off
on
the
left
,
arrive
at
the
foot
of
Stamford
Hill
.
<EOS>
He
walk
on
for
an
hour
longer
,
till
he
could
scarcely
drag
one
leg
after
another
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
he
fall
down
on
the
road
,
fully
expect
each
moment
would
prove
his
last
.
 
<EOS>
how
long
he
continue
thus
he
scarcely
know
;
but
just
before
dawn
,
he
manage
to
regain
his
leg
,
and
,
crawl
up
a
bank
,
perceive
he
be
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
a
short
way
off
in
the
field
he
descry
a
sort
of
shed
or
cow
-
house
,
<EOS>
and
thither
he
contrive
to
drag
his
weary
limb
.
<EOS>
open
the
door
,
he
find
it
litter
with
straw
,
on
which
he
throw
himself
,
and
instantly
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
awake
it
be
late
in
the
day
,
and
rain
heavily
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
could
not
stir
,
but
feel
sick
and
exhausted
.
<EOS>
His
leg
be
dreadfully
swell
;
his
hand
bruise
;
and
his
fetter
occasion
him
intolerable
pain
.
<EOS>
His
bodily
suffering
,
however
,
be
nothing
compare
with
his
mental
anguish
.
<EOS>
all
the
event
of
the
previous
day
rush
to
his
recollection
;
and
though
he
have
be
unintentionally
the
cause
of
his
mother
's
death
,
he
reproach
himself
as
severely
as
if
he
have
be
her
actual
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
"
had
I
not
be
the
guilty
wretch
I
be
,
"
he
cry
,
burst
into
an
agony
of
tear
,
"
she
would
never
have
die
thus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
strong
feeling
of
remorse
have
find
a
natural
vent
,
in
some
degree
subside
,
and
he
address
himself
to
his
present
situation
.
<EOS>
rouse
himself
,
he
go
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
have
cease
raining
,
but
the
atmosphere
be
moist
and
chill
,
and
the
ground
deluge
by
the
recent
shower
.
<EOS>
take
up
a
couple
of
large
stone
which
lie
near
,
Jack
try
to
beat
the
round
basil
of
the
fetter
into
an
oval
form
,
so
as
to
enable
him
to
slip
his
heel
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
employ
a
farming
man
come
into
the
barn
.
<EOS>
Jack
instantly
start
to
his
foot
,
and
the
man

at
his
appearance
,
run
off
to
a
neighbouring
house
.
<EOS>
before
he
could
return
,
Jack
have
make
good
his
retreat
;
and
,
wander
about
the
lane
and
hedge
,
keep
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
on
examine
his
pocket
,
he
find
about
twenty
guinea
in
gold
,
and
some
silver
.
<EOS>
but
how
to
avail
himself
of
it
be
the
question
,
for
in
his
present
garb
he
be
sure
to
be
recognise
.
<EOS>
when
night

Jack

they

<EOS>
all
the
jailer
declare
it
utterly
impossible
he
could
have
accomplish
his
astonishing
task
unaided
;
but
who
have

him
assistance
be
a
question
they
be
unable

<EOS>
proceed
to
the
entry
to
the
Lower
Leads

they
come
to
the
two
strong
door

and
their
surprise
be
so
great
at
Jack

marvellous
performance

that

near

which
I

I

mount
the
roof
of

they
trace
the

course
to
the

extremity

where
they
find
his
blanket
attach
to

direction

<EOS>
after
severely
examine
Austin
,
and
find
it
prove
,
on
the
testimony
of
his
fellow

jailer
,
that
he
could
not
have
aid
Jack
in
his
flight

Jonathan
retract
his
harsh
sentence
,

even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
would
act
as
mediator
between
him
and
the
governor

<EOS>
this
be
some
satisfaction
to
the
poor
fellow
,
who
be
dreadfully
frighten

as
indeed
he
may
well
be
,
it
be
the
opinion
of
the
jailer

other
who
afterwards
examine
the
place
,
that
Jack
have
accomplish
,
single
-
handed
,
in

few
hour

and
,
as
far
as
it
could
be

with
imperfect

what
it
would
have
take
half
a
dozen
man
several
day
,
provide
with
proper
tool
,
to
effect

<EOS>
in
their
opinion
a
hundred
pound
would
not
repair
the
damage

the
prison

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Jack

escape

thousand

the
