1801

<EOS>
I
have
just
return
from
a
visit
to
my
landlord
 
the
solitary
neighbour
that
I
shall
be
trouble
with
.
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
a
beautiful
country
!
<EOS>
in
all
England
,
I
do
not
believe
that
I
could
have
fix
on
a
situation
so
completely
remove
from
the
stir
of
society
.
<EOS>
a
perfect
misanthropist
's
heaven
:
and
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
and
I
be
such
a
suitable
pair
to
divide
the
desolation
between
us
.
<EOS>
a
capital
fellow
!
<EOS>
He
little
imagine
how
my
heart
warm
towards
him
when
I
beheld
his
black
eye
withdraw
so
suspiciously
under
their
brow
,
as
I
ride
up
,
and
when
his
finger
shelter
themselves
,
with
a
jealous
resolution
,
still
further
in
his
waistcoat
,
as
I
announce
my
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
a
nod
be
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lockwood
,
your
new
tenant
,
sir

<EOS>
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
call
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
arrival
,
to
express
the
hope
that
I
have
not
inconvenience
you
by
my
perseverance
in
solicit
the
occupation
of
Thrushcross
Grange
<EOS>
:
I
hear
yesterday
you
have
have
some

<EOS>
"
I
should
not
allow
any
one
to
inconvenience
me
,
if
I
could
hinder
it
 
walk
in

"
  
<EOS>
the
"
walk
in
"
be
utter
with
closed
tooth
,
and
express
the
sentiment
,
"
go
to
the
deuce
:
"
even
the
gate
over
which
he
lean
manifest
no
sympathise
movement
to
the
word
;
and
I
think
that
circumstance
determine
me
to
accept
the
invitation
<EOS>
:
I
feel
interested
in
a
man
who
seem
more
exaggeratedly
reserve
than
myself
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
see
my
horse
's
breast
fairly
push
the
barrier
,
he
do
put
out
his
hand
to
unchain
it
,
and
then
sullenly
precede
me
up
the
causeway

call
,
as
we
enter
the
court

"
Joseph
,
take
Mr.
Lockwood

horse

and
bring
up
some
wine

<EOS>

here
we
have
the
whole
establishment
of
domestic

I
suppose

be
the
reflection
suggest
by
this
compound
order
.
"
<EOS>
no
wonder
the
grass
grow
up
between
the
flag
,
and
cattle
be
the
only
hedge

cutter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
be
an
elderly
,
nay
,
an
old
man
:
very
old
,
perhaps
,
though
hale
and
sinewy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Lord
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
he
soliloquise
in
an
undertone
of
peevish
displeasure
,
while
relieve
me
of
my
horse
:
looking
,
meantime
,
in
my
face
so
sourly
that
I
charitably
conjecture
he
must
have
need
of
divine
aid
to
digest
his
dinner
,
and
his
pious
ejaculation
have
no
reference
to
my
unexpected
advent
.
  
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
be
the
name
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
"
wuthere
"
be
a
significant
provincial
adjective
,
descriptive
of
the
atmospheric
tumult
to
which
its
station
be
expose
in
stormy
weather
.
<EOS>
pure
,
brace
ventilation
they
must
have
up
there
at
all
time
,
indeed
<EOS>
:
one
may
guess
the
power
of
the
north
wind
blow
over
the
edge
,
by
the
excessive
slant
of
a
few
stunted
fir
at
the
end
of
the
house
;
and
by
a
range
of
gaunt
thorn
all
stretch
their
limb
one
way
,
as
if
crave
alm
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
happily
,
the
architect
have
foresight
to
build
it
strong
:
the
narrow
window
be
deeply
set
in
the
wall
,
and
the
corner
defend
with
large
jut
stone
.
  
<EOS>
before
pass
the
threshold
,
I
pause
to
admire
a
quantity
of
grotesque
carving
lavish
over
the
front
,
and
especially
about
the
principal
door
;
above
which
,
among
a
wilderness
of
crumble
griffin
and
shameless
little
boy
,
I
detect
the
date
"
1500
,
"
and
the
name
"
Hareton
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
make
a
few
comment
,
and
request
a
short
history
of
the
place
from
the
surly
owner
;
but
his
attitude
at
the
door
appear
to
demand
my
speedy
entrance
,
or
complete
departure
,
and
I
have
no
desire
to
aggravate
his
impatience
previous
to
inspect
the
penetralium
.
  
<EOS>
one
stop
bring
us
into
the
family
sit
-
room
,
without
any
introductory
lobby
or
passage
:
they
call
it
here
"
the
house
"
pre
-
eminently
.
<EOS>
It
include
kitchen
and
parlour
,
generally
;
but
I
believe
at
Wuthering
Heights
<EOS>
the
kitchen
be
force
to
retreat
altogether
into
another
quarter
:
at
least
I
distinguish
a
chatter
of
tongue
,
and
a
clatter
of
culinary
utensil
,
deep
within
;
and
I
observe
no
sign
of
roast
,
boiling
,
or
baking
,
about
the
huge
fireplace
;
nor
any
glitter
of
copper
saucepan
and
tin
cullender
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
one
end
,
indeed
,
reflect
splendidly
both
light
and
heat
from
rank
of
immense
pewter
dish
,
intersperse
with
silver
jug
and
tankard
,
tower
row
after
row
,
on
a
vast
oak
dresser
,
to
the
very
roof
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
never
be
under
-
draw
:
its
entire
anatomy
lie
bare
to
an
inquiring
eye
,
except
where
a
frame
of
wood
laden
with
oatcake
and
cluster
of
leg
of
beef
,
mutton
,
and
ham
,
conceal
it
.
<EOS>
above
the
chimney
be
sundry
villainous
old
gun
,
and
a
couple
of
horse
-
pistol
:
and
,
by
way
of
ornament
,
three
gaudily
-
paint
canister
dispose
along
its
ledge
.
<EOS>
the
floor
be
of
smooth
,
white
stone
;
the
chair
,
high
-
back
,
primitive
structure
,
paint
green
:
one
or
two
heavy
black
one
lurk
in
the
shade
.
<EOS>
in
an
arch
under
the
dresser
repose
a
huge
,
liver
-
colour
bitch
pointer
,
surround
by
a
swarm
of
squeal
puppy
;
and
other
dog
haunt
other
recess
.
  
<EOS>
the
apartment
and
furniture
would
have
be
nothing
extraordinary
as
belong
to
a
homely
,
northern
farmer
,
with
a
stubborn
countenance
,
and
stalwart
limb
set
out
to
advantage
in
knee
-
breech
and
gaiter
.
<EOS>
such
an
individual
seat
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
his
mug
of
ale
froth
on
the
round
table
before
him
,
be
to
be
see
in
any
circuit
of
five
or
six
mile
among
these
hill
,
if
you
go
at
the
right
time
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
form
a
singular
contrast
to
his
abode
and
style
of
living
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
dark
-
skinned
gipsy
in
aspect
,
in
dress
and
manner
<EOS>
a
gentleman
:
<EOS>
that
is
,
as
much
a
gentleman
as
many
a
country
squire
:
<EOS>
rather
slovenly
,
perhaps
,
yet
not
look
amiss
with
his
negligence
,
because
he
have
an
erect
and
handsome
figure
;
and
rather
morose
.
<EOS>
possibly
,
some
people
may
suspect
him
of
a
degree
of
under
-
breed
pride
;
I
have
a
sympathetic
chord
within
that
tell
me
it
be
nothing
of
the
sort
<EOS>
:
I
know
,
by
instinct
,
his
reserve
spring
from
an
aversion
to
showy
display
of
feeling
 
to
manifestation
of
mutual
kindliness
.
<EOS>
He
will
love
and
hate
equally
under
cover
,
and
esteem
it
a
species
of
impertinence
to
be
love
or
hate
again
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
run
on
too
fast
<EOS>
:
I
bestow
my
own
attribute
over
-
liberally
on
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
may
have
entirely
dissimilar
reason
for
keep
his
hand
out
of
the
way
when
he
meet
a
would
-
be
acquaintance
,
to
those
which
actuate
me
.
<EOS>
let
me
hope
my
constitution
be
almost
peculiar
:
my
dear
mother
use
to
say
I
should
never
have
a
comfortable
home
;
and
only
last
summer
I
prove
myself
perfectly
unworthy
of
one
.
  
<EOS>
while
enjoy
a
month
of
fine
weather
at
the
sea
-
coast
,
I
be
throw
into
the
company
of
a
most
fascinating
creature
:
a
real
goddess
in
my
eye
,
as
long
as
she
take
no
notice
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
"
never
tell
my
love
"
vocally
;
still
,
if
look
have
language
,
the
mere
idiot
may
have
guess
I
be
over
head
and
ear
:
she
understand
me
at
last
,
and
look
a
return
 
the
sweetest
of
all
imaginable
look
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
confess
it
with
shame
 
shrink
icily
into
myself
,
like
a
snail
;
at
every
glance
retire
colder
and
farther
;
till
finally
the
poor
innocent
be
lead
to
doubt
her
own
sense
,
and
,
overwhelm
with
confusion
at
her
suppose
mistake
,
persuade
her
mamma
to
decamp
.
<EOS>
by
this
curious
turn
of
disposition
I
have
gain
the
reputation
of
deliberate
heartlessness
;
how
undeserved
,
I
alone
can
appreciate
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
hearthstone
opposite
that
towards
which
my
landlord
advance
,
and
fill
up
an
interval
of
silence
by
attempt
to
caress
the
canine
mother
,
who
have
leave
her
nursery
,
and
be
sneak
wolfishly
to
the
back
of
my
leg
,
her
lip
curl
up
,
and
her
white
tooth
water
for
a
snatch
.
<EOS>
My
caress
provoke
a
long
,
guttural
gnarl
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
better
let
the
dog
alone
,
"
growl
Mr.
Heathcliff
in
unison
,
check
fiercer
demonstration
with
a
punch
of
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
accustomed
to
be
spoil
 
not
keep
for
a
pet
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
stride
to
a
side
door
,
he
shout
again
,
"
Joseph
!
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
mumble
indistinctly
in
the
depth
of
the
cellar
,
but
give
no
intimation
of
ascend
;
so
his
master
dive
down
to
him
,
leave
me
_
vis
-
a
-
vis
_
the
ruffianly
bitch
and
a
pair
of
grim
shaggy
sheep
-
dog
,
who
share
with
her
a
jealous
guardianship
over
all
my
movement
.
<EOS>
not
anxious
to
come
in
contact
with
their
fang
,
I
sit
still
;
but
,
imagine
they
would
scarcely
understand
tacit
insult
<EOS>
,
I
unfortunately
indulge
in
wink
and
make
face
at
the
trio
,
and
some
turn
of
my
physiognomy
so
irritated
madam
,
that
she
suddenly
break
into
a
fury
and
leapt
on
my
knee
.
<EOS>
I
fling
her
back
,
and
hasten
to
interpose
the
table
between
us
.
<EOS>
this
proceeding
arouse
the
whole
hive
:
half
-
a
-
dozen
four
-
foot
fiend
,
of
various
size
and
age
,
issue
from
hide
den
to
the
common
centre
.
<EOS>
I
feel
my
heel
and
coat
-
laps
peculiar
subject
of
assault
;
and
parry
off
the
large
combatant
as
effectually
as
I
could
with
the
poker
,
I
be
constrain
to
demand
,
aloud
,
assistance
from
some
of
the
household
in
re
-
establish
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
and
his
man
climb
the
cellar
step
with
vexatious
phlegm
<EOS>
:
I
do
not
think
they
move
one
second
faster
than
usual
,
though
the
hearth
be
an
absolute
temp
of
worrying
and
yelping
.
<EOS>
happily
,
an
inhabitant
of
the
kitchen
make
more
despatch
:
<EOS>
a
lusty
dame
,
with
tuck
-
up
gown
,
bare
arm
,
and
fire
-
flush
cheek
,
rush
into
the
midst
of
us
flourish
a
fry
-
pan
:
and
use
that
weapon
,
and
her
tongue
,
to
such
purpose
,
that
the
storm
subside
magically
,
and
she
only
remain
,
heave
like
a
sea
after
a
high
wind
,
when
her
master
enter
on
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
the
devil
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
eye
me
in
a
manner
that
I
could
ill
endure
,
after
this
inhospitable
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
the
devil
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
mutter
.
<EOS>
"
the

You

<EOS>
"
They

he
remark
,
put
the
bottle
before
me

and
restore
the
displace
table
.

relax
into
a
grin
.

"

he
say
,
"

<EOS>
Your
health
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bow
and
return
the
pledge
;
begin
to
perceive
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
sit
sulking
for
the
misbehaviour
of
a
pack
of
cur
;
besides
,
I
feel
loth
to
yield
the
fellow
further
amusement
at
my
expense
;
since
his
humour
take
that
turn
.
<EOS>
He
 
probably
sway
by
prudential
consideration
of
the
folly
of
offend
a
good
tenant
 
relax
a
little
in
the
laconic
style
of
chip
off
his
pronoun
and
auxiliary
verb
,
and
introduce
what
he
suppose
would
be
a
subject
of
interest
to
me
,
 
a
discourse
on
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
my
present
place
of
retirement
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
very
intelligent
on
the
topic
we
touch
;
and
before
I
go
home
,
I
be
encourage
so
far
as
to
volunteer
another
visit
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
evidently
wish
no
repetition
of
my
intrusion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
,
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
how
sociable
I
feel
myself
compare
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
yesterday
afternoon
set
in
misty
and
cold
.
<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
to
spend
it
by
my
study
fire
,
instead
of
wade
through
heath
and
mud
to
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
on
come
up
from
dinner
,
however
,
(
N.B.
 
I
dine
between
twelve
and
one
o'clock
;
the
housekeeper
,
a
matronly
lady
,
take
as
a
fixture
along
with
the
house
,
could
not
,
or
would
not

comprehend
my
request
that
I
may
be
serve
at
five
)
 
on
mount
the
stair
with
this
lazy
intention
,
and
step
into
the
room
,
I
see
a
servant
-
girl
on
her
knee
surround
by
brush
and
coal
-
scuttle
,
and
raise
an
infernal
dust
as
she
extinguish
the
flame
with
heap
of
cinder
.
<EOS>
this
spectacle
drive

I

after

mile

arrive
at
Heathcliff

garden

gate
just
in

to
escape
the
first
feathery
flake
of
a
snow

shower

<EOS>
on
that
bleak
hill

earth

hard
with
a
black
frost
,
and
the
air
make
me

through
every
limb

<EOS>
be
unable
to
remove
the
chain
,
I
jump
over

and
,
run
up
the
flagged
causeway
border
with
straggle
gooseberry

bush
,
knock
vainly
for
admittance
,
till
my

tingle
and
the

<EOS>
"
wretched

<EOS>
"
I
ejaculate
,
mentally
,
"
you

perpetual
isolation

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
the

thickly

<EOS>
I
seize
the

to
essay
another
trial
;
when
a
young
man
without
coat
,
and
shoulder
a
pitchfork
,
appear
in
the
yard
behind

<EOS>
He
hail
me
to
follow

and
,
after
march
through
a

house

and
a
paved
area
contain
a
coal

shed
,
pump
,
and
pigeon

cot

we
at
length
arrive
in
the
huge
,
warm
,
cheerful
apartment
where
I
be
formerly
receive
.
<EOS>
It
glow
delightfully
in
the
radiance
of
an
immense
fire
,
compound
of
coal
,
peat
,
and
wood
;
and
near
the
table
,
lay
for
a
plentiful
evening
meal
,
I
be
pleased
to
observe
the
"
missis
,
"
an
individual
whose
existence
I
have
never
previously
suspect
.
<EOS>
I
bow
and
wait
,
think
she
would
bid
me
take
a
seat
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
,
lean
back
in
her
chair
,
and
remain
motionless
and
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
rough
weather
!
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
the
door
must
bear
the
consequence
of
your
servant
'
leisure
attendance
:
I
have
hard
work
to
make
them
hear
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
never
open
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
I
stare
 
<EOS>
she
stare
also
:
at
any
rate
,
she
keep
her
eye
on
me
in
a
cool
,
regardless
manner
,
exceedingly
embarrassing
and
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
"
say
the
young
man
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
will
be
in
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obey
;
and
hem
,
and
call
the
villain
Juno
,
who
deign
,
at
this
second
interview
,
to
move
the
extreme
tip
of
her
tail
,
in
token
of
own
my
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
beautiful
animal
!
<EOS>
"
I
commence
again
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
intend
part
with
the
little
one
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
mine
,
"
say
the
amiable
hostess
,
more
repellingly
than
Heathcliff
himself
could
have
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
your
favourite
be
among
these
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
continue
,
turn
to
an
obscure
cushion
full
of
something
like
cat
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
strange
choice
of
favourite
!
"
<EOS>
she
observe
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
it
be
a
heap
of
dead
rabbit
.
<EOS>
I
hem
once
more
,
and
draw
closer
to
the
hearth
,
repeat
my
comment
on
the
wildness
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
come
out
,
"
she
say
,
rise
and
reach
from
the
chimney
-
piece
two
of
the
paint
canister
.
  
<EOS>
Her
position
before
be
shelter
from
the
light
;
now
,
I
have
a
distinct
view
of
her
whole
figure
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
be
slend
,
and
apparently
scarcely
past
girlhood
:
an
admirable
form
,
and
the
most
exquisite
little
face
that
I
have
ever
have
the
pleasure
of
behold
;
small
feature
,
very
fair
;
flaxen
ringlet
,
or
rather
golden
,
hang
loose
on
her
delicate
neck
;
and
eye
,
<EOS>
have
they
be
agreeable
in
expression
,
that
would
have
be
irresistible
:
fortunately
for
my
susceptible
heart
,
the
only
sentiment
they
evince
hover
between
scorn
and
a
kind
of
desperation
,
singularly
unnatural
to
be
detect
there
.
<EOS>
the
canister
be
almost
out
of
her
reach
;
I
make
a
motion
to
aid
her
;
she
turn
upon
me
as
a
miser
may
turn
if
any
one
attempt
to
assist
him
in
count
his
gold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
your
help
,
"
she
snap
;
"
I
can
get
them
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
"
I
hasten
to
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
ask
to
tea
?
"
<EOS>
she
demand
,
tie
an
apron
over
her
neat
black
frock
,
and
stand
with
a
spoonful
of
the
leaf
poise
over
the
pot
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
cup
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
ask
?
"
she
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
say
,
half
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
proper
person
to
ask
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
fling
the
tea
back
,
spoon
and
all
,
and
resume
her
chair
in
a
pet
;
her
forehead
corrugate
,
and
her
red
under
-
lip
push
out
,
like
a
child
's
ready
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
young
man
have
sling
on
to
his
person
a
decidedly
shabby
upper
garment
,
and
,
erect
himself
before
the
blaze
,
look
down
on
me
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
for
all
the
world
as
if
there
be
some
mortal
feud
unavenge
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
he
be
a
servant
or
not
:
his
dress
and
speech
be
both
rude
,
entirely
devoid
of
the
superiority
observable
in
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
;
his
thick
brown
curl
be
rough
and
uncultivated
,
his
whisker
encroach
bearishly
over
his
cheek
,
and
his
hand
be
embrown
like
those
of
a
common
labourer
:
still
his
bearing
be
free
,
almost
haughty
,
and
he
show
none
of
a
domestic
's
assiduity
in
attend
on
the
lady
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
clear
proof
of
his
condition
,
I
deem
it
best
to
abstain
from
notice
his
curious
conduct
;
and
,
five
minute
afterwards
,
the
entrance
of
Heathcliff
relieve
me
,
in
some
measure
,
from
my
uncomfortable
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
sir
,
I
be
come
,
accord
to
promise
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
,
assume
the
cheerful
;
"
and
I
fear
I
shall
be
weather
-
bind
for
half
an
hour
,
if
you
can
afford
me
shelter
during
that
space
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
half
an
hour
<EOS>
?
"
he
say
,
shake
the
white
flake
from
his
clothe
;
"
I
wonder
you
should
select
the
thick
of
a
snow
-
storm
to
ramble
about
in
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
you
run
a
risk
of
be
lose
in
the
marsh
?
<EOS>
People
familiar
with
these
moor
often
miss
their
road
on
such
evening
;
and
I
can
tell
you
there
be
no
chance
of
a
change
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
can
get
a
guide
among
your
lad
,
and
he
may
stay
at
the
grange
till
morning
 
<EOS>
could
you
spare
me
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
could
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
I
must
trust
to
my
own
sagacity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Umph
!
"
  
"
be
you
go
to
mak
'
the
tea
?
"
demand
he
of
the
shabby
coat
,
shift
his
ferocious
gaze
from
me
to
the
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
_
<EOS>
he
_
<EOS>
to
have
any
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
appeal
to
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
get
it
ready
,
will
you
?
"
be
the
answer
,
utter
so
savagely
that
I
start
.
<EOS>
the
tone
in
which
the
word
be
say
reveal
a
genuine
bad
nature
.
<EOS>
I
no
longer
feel
inclined
to
call
Heathcliff
a
capital
fellow
.
<EOS>
when
the
preparation
be
finish
,
he
invite
me
with
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
sir
,
bring
forward
your
chair
.
"
<EOS>
and
we
all
,
include
the
rustic
youth
,
draw
round
the
table
:
an
austere
silence
prevail
while
we
discuss
our
meal
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
if
I
have
cause
the
cloud
,
it
be
my
duty
to
make
an
effort
to
dispel
it
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
every
day
sit
so
grim
and
taciturn
;
and
it
be
impossible
<EOS>
,
however
ill
-
tempered
they
may
be
,
that
the
universal
scowl
they
wear
be
their
every
-
day
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
,
"
I
begin
,
<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
swallow
one
cup
of
tea
and
receive
another
 
"
it
be
strange
how
custom
can
mould
our
taste
and
idea
:
many
could
not
imagine
the
existence
of
happiness
in
a
life
of
such
complete
exile
from
the
world
as
you
spend
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
yet
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
,
surround
by
your
family
,
and
with
your
amiable
lady
as
the
preside
genius
over
your
home
and
heart
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
amiable
lady
!
"
<EOS>
he
interrupt
,
with
an
almost
diabolical
sneer
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
be
she
 
my
amiable
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
your
wife
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
yes
 
oh
,
you
would
intimate
that
her
spirit
have
take
the
post
of
minister
angel
,
and
guard
the
fortune
of
Wuthering
Heights
,
even
when
her
body
be
go
.
<EOS>
be
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
perceive
myself
in
a
blunder
,
I
attempt
to
correct
it
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
see
there
be
too
great
a
disparity
between
the
age
of
the
party
to
make
it
likely
that
they
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
one
be
about
forty
:
a
period
of
mental
vigour
at
which
man
seldom
cherish
the
delusion
of
be
marry
for
love
by
girl
:
that
dream
be
reserve
for
the
solace
of
our
decline
year
.
<EOS>
the
other
do
not
look
seventeen
.
  
<EOS>
then
it
flash
upon
me
 
<EOS>
"
the
clown
at
my
elbow
,
who
be
drink
his
tea
out
of
a
basin
and
eat
his
bread
with
unwashed
hand

may
be
her
husband

<EOS>
Heathcliff
junior
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
consequence
of
be
bury
alive
:
she
have
throw
herself
away
upon
that
boor
from
sheer
ignorance
that
well
individual
exist
!
<EOS>
a
sad
pity
 
<EOS>
I
must
beware
how
I
cause
her
to
regret
her
choice
.
<EOS>
"
the
last
reflection
may
seem
conceited
;
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
My
neighbour
strike
me
as
border
on
repulsive
;
I
know
,
through
experience
,
that
I
be
tolerably
attractive
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
be
my
daughter
-
in

law
,
"
say
Heathcliff
,
corroborate
my
surmise
.
<EOS>
He
turn
,
as
he
speak
,
a
peculiar
look
in
her
direction
:
a
look
of
hatred
;
unless
he
have
a
most
perverse
set
of
facial
muscle
that
will
not
,
like
those
of
other
people
,
interpret
the
language
of
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
certainly
 
I
see
now
:
you
be
the
favour
possessor
of
the
beneficent
fairy
,
"
I
remark
,
turn
to
my
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
bad
than
before
:
the
youth
grow
crimson
,
and
clench
his
fist
,
with
every
appearance
of
a
meditate
assault
.
<EOS>
but
he
seem
to
recollect
himself
presently
,
and
smother
the
storm
in
a
brutal
curse
,
mutter
on
my
behalf
:
which
,
however
,
I
take
care
not
to
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
unhappy
in
your
conjecture
,
sir
,
"
observe
my
host
;
"
we
neither
of
us
have
the
privilege
of
own
your
good
fairy

her
mate

dead

<EOS>
I
say
she
be
my
daughter
-
in

law
:
therefore
,
she
must
have
marry
my
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
this
young
man
be
 
"
  
"
not
my
son

assuredly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
smile
again
,
as
if
it
be
rather
too
bold
a
jest
to
attribute
the
paternity
of
that
bear
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
be
Hareton
Earnshaw

"
growl
the
other
;
"
and
I
would
counsel
you
to
respect
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
show
no
disrespect
,
"
be
my
reply
,
laugh
internally
at
the
dignity
with
which
he
announce
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
fix
his
eye
on
me
longer
than
I
care
to
return
the
stare
,
for
fear
I
may
be
tempt
either
to
box
his
ear
or
render
my
hilarity
audible
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
feel
unmistakably
out
of
place
in
that
pleasant
family
circle
.
<EOS>
the
dismal
spiritual
atmosphere
overcame
,
and
more
than
neutralised
,
the
glowing
physical
comfort
round
me
;
and
I
resolve
to
be
cautious
how
I
venture
under
those
rafter
a
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
business
of
eat
be
conclude
,
and
no
one
utter
a
word
of
sociable
conversation
,
I
approach
a
window
to
examine
the
weather
.
<EOS>
a
sorrowful
sight
I
see
:
dark
night
come
down
prematurely
,
and
sky
and
hill
mingle
in
one
bitter
whirl
of
wind
and
suffocate
snow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
possible
for
me
to
get

fly

down

a
mingled
guffaw
from
Heathcliff

put
the
copestone
on

rage

humiliation

fortunately

the
beast
seem
more
bent

stretch
their
paw

yawning

flourish
their
tail

devour

alive

they
would
suffer
no

I
be
force
to
lie

their
malignant
master
please

deliver

then

hatless

tremble
with
wrath

me
out
 
on

keep
me
one
minute
longer
 
with
several
incoherent
threat
of
retaliation
that
,
in

indefinite
depth

virulency

smack
of
King
Lear

the
vehemence
of
my
agitation
bring
on
a
copious
bleeding
at
the
nose
,

still
Heathcliff
laugh

still
I
scold

I
do
not

what
would
have
conclude
the
scene

have
there
not

one
person
at
hand
rather
more
rational
than
myself

more
benevolent
than

this
be
Zillah

the
stout
housewife

who
at
length
issue
forth
to
inquire
into
the
nature

the
uproar

think
that
some
of
them
have
be
lay
violent
hand
on

not
dare

attack
her
master

turn
her
vocal
artillery

scoundrel

with
these
word
she
suddenly
splash
a
pint
of
icy
water
down
my
neck

and
pull
me
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
follow
,
his
accidental
merriment
expire
quickly
in
his
habitual
moroseness
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sick
exceedingly
,
and
dizzy
,
and
faint
;
and
thus
compel
perforce
to
accept
lodging
under
his
roof
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Zillah
to
give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
,
and
then
pass
on
to
the
inner
room
;
while
she
condole
with
me
on
my
sorry
predicament
,
and
have
obey
his
order
,
whereby
I
be
somewhat
revive
,
usher
me
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
while
lead
the
way
upstairs
,
she
recommend
that
I
should
hide
the
candle
,
and
not
make
a
noise
;
for
her
master
have
an
odd
notion
about
the
chamber
she
would
put
me
in
,
and
never
let
anybody
lodge
there
willingly
.
<EOS>
I
ask
the
reason
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
,
she
answer
:
she
have
only
live
there
a
year
or
two
;
and
they
have
so
many
queer
going
on
,
she
could
not
begin
to
be
curious
.
  
<EOS>
too
stupefy
to
be
curious
myself
,
I
fasten
my
door
and
glance
round
for
the
bed
.
<EOS>
the
whole
furniture
consist
of
a
chair
,
a
clothe
-
press
,
and
a
large
oak
case
,
with
square
cut
out
near
the
top
resemble
coach
window
.
<EOS>
have
approach
this
structure
,
I
look
inside
,
and
perceive
it
to
be
a
singular
sort
of
old
-
fashioned
couch
,
very
conveniently
design
to
obviate
the
necessity
for
every
member
of
the
family
have
a
room
to
himself
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
form
a
little
closet
,
and
the
ledge
of
a
window
,
which
it
enclose
,
serve
as
a
table
.
<EOS>
I
slide
back
the
panel
side
,
get
in
with
my
light
,
pull
them
together
again
,
and
feel
secure
against
the
vigilance
of
Heathcliff
,
and
every
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
the
ledge
,
where
I
place
my
candle
,
have
a
few
mildew
book
pile
up
in
one
corner
;
and
it
be
cover
with
writing
scratch
on
the
paint
.
<EOS>
this
writing
,
however
,
be
nothing
but
<EOS>
a
name
repeat
in
all
kind
of
character
,
large
and
small
 
_
Catherine
Earnshaw
_
,
here
and
there
vary
to
_
Catherine
Heathcliff
_
,
and
then
again
to
_
Catherine
Linton
_
.
  
<EOS>
in
vapid
listlessness
I
leant
my
head
against
the
window
,
and
continue
spell
over
Catherine
Earnshaw
 
Heathcliff
 
Linton
,
till
my
eye
closed
;
but
they
have
not
rest
five
minute
when
a
glare
of
white
letter
start
from
the
dark
,
as
vivid
as
spectre
 
the
air
swarm
with
Catherines
;
and
rouse
myself
to
dispel
the
obtrusive
name
,
I
discover
my
candle
-
wick
recline
on
one
of
the
antique
volume
,
and
perfume
the
place
with
an
odour
of
roasted
calf
-
skin
.
<EOS>
I
snuff
it
off
,
and
,
very
ill
at
ease
under
the
influence
of
cold
and
linger
nausea
,
sit
up
and
spread
open
the
injure
tome
on
my
knee
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
Testament
,
in
lean
type
,
and
smell
dreadfully
musty
:
a
fly
-
leaf
bore
the
inscription
 
<EOS>
"
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
her
book
,
"
and
a
date
some
quarter
of
a
century
back
.
<EOS>
I
shut
it
,
and
take
up
another
and
another
,
till
I
have
examine
all
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
library
be
select

and
its
state
of
dilapidation
prove
it
to
have
be
well
use
,
though
not
altogether
for
a
legitimate
purpose
:
scarcely
one
chapter
have
escape
,
a
pen

and

ink
commentary
 
at
least
the
appearance
of
one
 
cover
every
morsel
of
blank

the

have
leave

<EOS>
some

other

take
the
form
of
a
regular
diary
,
scrawl
in
an
unformed

childish
hand

<EOS>
at
the
top
of
an
extra

(
quite
a

probably
,
when
first

I
be
greatly
amuse
to
behold
an
excellent
caricature

rudely

powerfully
sketch

<EOS>
an
immediate

kindle
within
me
for

Joseph

need
get
up
a
congregation

,
while
Hindley
and
his
wife
bask
downstairs
before
a
comfortable
fire
 
do
anything

read
their
Bibles

I
will
answer
for

Heathcliff

myself

and
the
unhappy
ploughboy

command
to
take
our
prayer

book

and
mount

<EOS>
we
be
range
in
a
row
,
on
a
sack
of
corn
,
groaning
and
shivering
,
and
hope
that
Joseph
would
shiver
too
,
so
that
he
may
give
us
a
short
homily
for
his
own
sake
.
<EOS>
a
vain
idea
!
<EOS>
the
service
last
precisely
three
hour
;
and
yet
my
brother
have
the
face
to
exclaim
,
when
he
see
us
descend
,
"
what

do
already

"
<EOS>
on
Sunday
evening
we
use
to
be
permit
to
play
,
if
we
do
not
make
much
noise
;
now
a
mere
titter
be
sufficient
to
send
us
into
corner

"
You

the

I

heartily

then
go

herself
on

there

up

over

I
begin
to
nod
drowsily
over
the
dim
page
:
my
eye
wander
from

to

I
see
a
red
ornamented
title

pious
discourse

Reverend
Jabez
Branderham

in
the
Chapel
of
Gimmerden
Sough
.
"
<EOS>
and
while
I
be
,
half
-
consciously
,
worry
my
brain
to
guess
what
Jabez
Branderham
would
make
of
his
subject
,
I
sink
back
in
bed
,
and
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
alas
,
for
the
effect
of
bad
tea
and
bad
temper
!
<EOS>
what
else
could
it
be
that
make
me
pass
such
a
terrible
night
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
another
that
I
can
at
all
compare
with
it
since
I
be
capable
of
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
dream
,
almost
before
I
cease
to
be
sensible
of
my
locality
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
morning
;
and
I
have
set
out
on
my
way
home
,
with
Joseph
for
a
guide
.
<EOS>
the
snow
lie
yard
deep
in
our
road
;
and
,
as
we
flounder
on
,
my
companion
weary
me
with
constant
reproach
that
I
have
not
bring
a
pilgrim
's
staff
:
tell
me
that
I
could
never
get
into
the
house
without
one
,
and
boastfully
flourish
a
heavy
-
head
cudgel
,
which
I
understand
to
be
so
denominate
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
I
consider
it
absurd
that
I
should
need
such
a
weapon
to
gain
admittance
into
my
own
residence
.
<EOS>
then
a
new
idea
flash
across
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
there
:
we
be
journey
to
hear
the
famous
Jabez
Branderham
preach
,
from
the
text
 
"
Seventy
Times
Seven
;
"
and
either
Joseph
,
the
preacher
,
or
I
have
commit
the
"
first
of
the
Seventy
-
First
,
"
and
be
to
be
publicly
expose
and
excommunicate
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
I
have
pass
it
really
in
my
walk
,
twice
or
thrice
;
it
lie
in
a
hollow
,
between
two
hill
:
an
elevated
hollow
,
near
a
swamp
,
whose
peaty
moisture
be
say
to
answer
all
the
purpose
of
embalm
on
the
few
corpse
deposit
there
.
<EOS>
the
roof
have
be
keep
whole
hitherto
;
but
as
the
clergyman
's
stipend
be
only
twenty
pound
per
annum
,
and
a
house
with
two
room
,
threaten
speedily
to
determine
into
one
,
no
clergyman
will
undertake
the
duty
of
pastor
:
especially
as
it
be
currently
report
that
his
flock
would
rather
let
him
starve
than
increase
the
living
by
one
penny
from
their
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
my
dream
,
Jabez
have
a
full
and
attentive
congregation
;
and
he
preach
 
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
sermon
;
divide
into
_
four
hundred
and
ninety
_
part
,
each
fully
equal
to
an
ordinary
address
from
the
pulpit
,
and
each
discuss
a
separate
sin
!
<EOS>
where
he
search
for
them
,
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
private
manner
of
interpret
the
phrase
,
and
it
seem
necessary
the
brother
should
sin
different
sin
on
every
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
be
of
the
most
curious
character
:
odd
transgression
that
I
never
imagine
previously
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
how
weary
I
grow
.
<EOS>
how
I
writhe
,
and
yawn
,
and
nod
,
and
revive
!
<EOS>
how
I
pinch
and
prick
myself
,
and
rub
my
eye
,
and
stand
up
,
and
sit
down
again
,
and
nudge
Joseph
to
inform
me
if
he
would
_
ever
_
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
condemn
to
hear
all
out
:
finally
,
he
reach
the
"
_
First
of
the
Seventy
-
First
_
.
"
<EOS>
at
that
crisis
,
a
sudden
inspiration
descend
on
me
;
I
be
move
to
rise
and
denounce
Jabez
Branderham
as
the
sinner
of
the
sin
that
no
christian
need
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
I
exclaim
,
"
sit
here
within
these
four
wall
,
at
one
stretch
,
I
have
endure
and
forgive
the
four
hundred

ninety
head
of
your

seventy

seven

I
pluck
up

be
about

you
preposterously

have
at
him

<EOS>
drag
him
down

and
crush
him

know
him
may
know
him
no

"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Thou
art
the
Man

!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jabez
,
after
a
solemn
pause
,
lean
over
his
cushion
.
"
<EOS>
seventy
time
seven
time
didst
<EOS>
thou
gapingly
contort
thy
visage
 
seventy

<EOS>
do
I
take
counsel
with
my
soul
 
Lo
,
this
be
human
weakness

also
may
be
absolve
!

the
first
of
the
Seventy

First

<EOS>
Brethren
,
execute
upon
him
the
judgment

<EOS>
such
honour
have
all
His
saint

"
  
<EOS>
with
that
conclude
word
,
the
whole
assembly
,
exalt
their
pilgrim
's
stave
,
rush
round
me
in
a
body
;
and
I
,
have
no
weapon
to
raise
in
self
-
defence
,
commence
grapple
with
Joseph
,
my
near
and
most
ferocious
assailant
,
for
his
.
<EOS>
in
the
confluence
of
the
multitude
,
several
club
cross
;
blow
,
aim
at
me
,
fall
on
other
sconce
.
<EOS>
presently
the
whole
chapel
resound
with
rapping
and
counter
rapping
:
every
man
's
hand
be
against
his
neighbour
;
and
Branderham
,
unwilling
to
remain
idle
,
pour
forth
his
zeal
in
a
shower
of
loud
tap
on
the
board
of
the
pulpit
,
which
respond
so
smartly
that
,
at
last
,
to
my
unspeakable
relief
,
they
wake
me
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
it
that
have
suggest
the
tremendous
tumult
?
<EOS>
what
have
play
Jabez
's
part
in
the
row
?
<EOS>
merely
the
branch
of
a
fir
-
tree
that
touch
my
lattice
as
the
blast
wail
by
,
and
rattle
its
dry
cone
against
the
pane
!
<EOS>
I
listen
doubtingly
an
instant
;
detect
the
disturber
,
then
turn
and
doze
,
and
dreamt
again
:
if
possible
,
still
more
disagreeably
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
time
,
I
remember
I
be
lie
in
the
oak
closet
,
and
I
hear
distinctly
the
gusty
wind
,
and
the
driving
of
the
snow
;
I
hear
,
also
,
the
fir
bough
repeat
its
teasing
sound
,
and
ascribe
it
to
the
right
cause
:
but
it
annoy
me
so
much
,
that
I
resolve
to
silence
it
,
if
possible
;
and
,
I
think
,
I
rise
and
endeavour
to
unhasp
the
casement
.
<EOS>
the
hook
be
solder
into
the
staple
:
a
circumstance
observe
by
me
when
awake
,
but
forget
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
stop
it
,
nevertheless
!
"
I
mutter
,
knock
my
knuckle
through
the
glass
,
and
stretch
an
arm
out
to
seize
the
importunate
branch
;
instead
of
which
,
my
finger
close
on
the
finger
of
a
little
,
ice
-
cold
hand
!
<EOS>
the
intense
horror
of
nightmare
come
over
me
:
I
try
to
draw
back
my
arm
,
but
the
hand
cling
to
it
,
and
a
most
melancholy
voice
sob
,
"
let
me
in
 
let
me
in
!
"
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
,
struggle
,
meanwhile
,
to
disengage
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
Linton
,
"
it
reply
,
shiveringly
(
why
do
I
think
of
_
Linton
_
?
<EOS>
I
have
read
_
Earnshaw
_
twenty
time
for
Linton
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
home
:
I
would
lose
my
way
on
the
moor
!
"
<EOS>
as
it
speak
,
I
discern
,
obscurely
,
a
child
's
face
look
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Terror
make
me
cruel
;
and
,
find
it
useless
to
attempt
shake
the
creature
off
,
I
pull
its
wrist
on
to
the
broken
pane
,
and
rub
it
to
and
fro
till
the
blood
run
down
and
soak
the
bedclothe
:
still
it
wail
,
"
let
me
in
!
"
and
maintain
its
tenacious
gripe
,
almost
madden
me
with
fear
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
let
_
me
<EOS>
_
go
,
if
you
want
me
to
let
you
in
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
finger
relax
,
I
snatch
mine
through
the
hole
,
hurriedly
pile
the
book
up
in
a
pyramid
against
it
,
and
stop
my
ear
to
exclude
the
lamentable
prayer
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
keep
them
close
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
yet
,
the
instant
I
listen
again
,
there
be
the
doleful
cry
moan
on
!
"
<EOS>
Begone
!
"
<EOS>
I
shout
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
let
you
in
,
not
if
you
beg
for
twenty
year
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
twenty
year
,
"
mourn
the
voice
:
"
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
waif
for
twenty
year
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thereat
begin
a
feeble
scratching
outside
,
and
the
pile
of
book
move
as
if
thrust
forward
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
jump
up
;
but
could
not
stir
a
limb
;
and
so
yell
aloud
,
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
.
<EOS>
to
my
confusion
,
I
discover
the
yell
be
not
ideal
:
hasty
footstep
approach
my
chamber
door
;
somebody
push
it
open
,
with
a
vigorous
hand
,
and
a
light
glimmer
through
the
square
at
the
top
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
sit
shudder
yet
,
and
wipe
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
:
the
intruder
appear
to
hesitate
,
and
mutter
to
himself
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
say
,
in
a
half
-
whisper
,
plainly
not
expect
an
answer
,
"
be
any
one
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
consider
it
best
to
confess
my
presence
;
for
I
know
Heathcliff
's
accent
,
and
fear
he
may
search
further
,
if
I
keep
quiet
.
<EOS>
with
this
intention
,
I
turn
and
open
the
panel
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
soon
forget
the
effect
my
action
produce
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
stand
near
the
entrance
,
in
his
shirt
and
trouser
;
with
a
candle
drip
over
his
finger
,
and
his
face
as
white
as
the
wall
behind
him
.
<EOS>
the
first
creak
of
the
oak
startle
him
like
an
electric
shock
:
the
light
leap
from
his
hold
to
a
distance
of
some
foot
,
and
his
agitation
be
so
extreme
,
that
he
could
hardly
pick
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
your
guest
,
sir
,
"
I
call
out
,
desirous
to
spare
him
the
humiliation
of
expose
his
cowardice
further
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
misfortune
to
scream
in
my
sleep
,
owe
to
a
frightful
nightmare
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
disturb
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

oh
,
God
confound
you

Mr.
Lockwood

commence
my
host
,
set
the
candle
on
a
chair
,
because
he
find
it
impossible
to
hold
it
steady
.
"
<EOS>
and
who
show
you
up
into
this
room
?
<EOS>
"
he
continue
,
crush
his
nail
into
his
palm
,
and
grind
his
tooth
to
subdue
the
maxillary
convulsion
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
turn
them
out
of
the
house
this
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
servant
Zillah
,
"
I
reply
,
fling
myself
on
to
the
floor
,
and
rapidly
resume
my
garment
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
care
if
you
do
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
she
richly
deserve
it

<EOS>
I
suppose
that
she
want
to
get
another
proof
that
the
place
be
haunt

at
my
expense

<EOS>
well
,
it
be
 
swarm
with
ghost

goblin

<EOS>
You
have
reason
in
shut
it
up

I
assure
you

<EOS>
no
one
will
thank
you
for
a
doze
in
such
a
den

<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean

ask
Heathcliff
,

and
what
be
you
do
?
<EOS>
lie
down
and
finish
out
the
night
,
since
you

here
;
but
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
do
not
repeat
that
horrid
noise
:
nothing
could
excuse
it
,
unless
you
be
have
your
throat
cut

<EOS>
"
if
the
little
fiend
have
get
in
at
the
window

she
probably
would
have
strangle
me

I
return
.
<EOS>

I
be
not
go
to
endure
the
persecution
of
your
hospitable
ancestor
again

not
the
Reverend
Jabez
Branderham
akin

no

<EOS>
scarcely
be
these
word
utter
when
I
recollect
the
association
of
Heathcliff
's
with
Catherine
's
name
in
the
book
,
which
have
completely
slip
from
my
memory

till
thus
awaken
.
<EOS>
I
blush
at
my
inconsideration
:
but
,
without
show
further
consciousness
of
the
offence
,
I
hasten
to
add
 
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
sir
,
I
pass
the

night

here
I
stop
afresh
 
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
say
"

then
it
would
have
reveal
my
knowledge
of

write
,
as
well

content

so
,
correct
myself

I
go
on

in
spell
over
the

scratch
on

window

ledge

<EOS>
a
monotonous
occupation
,
calculate
to
set
me
asleep

like
counting

Heathcliff
with
savage
vehemence

how
 
how

you

under

God

he

mad

speak
so

<EOS>
and
he
strike
his
forehead
with
rage
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
to
resent
this
language
or
pursue
my
explanation
;
but
he
seem
so
powerfully
affected
that
I
take
pity
and
proceed
with
my
dream
;
affirm
I
have
never
hear
the
appellation
of
"
Catherine
Linton
"
before
,
but
read
it
often
over
produce
an
impression
which
personify
itself
when
I
have
no
longer
my
imagination
under
control

<EOS>
Heathcliff
gradually
fall
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
bed
,
as
I
speak
;
finally
sit
down
almost
conceal
behind
it
.
<EOS>
I
guess
,
however
,
by
his
irregular
and
intercept
breathing
,
that
he
struggle
to
vanquish
an
excess
of
violent
emotion
.
<EOS>
not
like
to
show
him
that
I
have
hear
the
conflict
,
I
continue
my
toilette
rather
noisily
,
look
at
my
watch

and
soliloquise
on
the
length
of
the
night
:

not
three

I
could
have
take
oath

it

time
stagnate
here

always
at
nine

winter

and
rise
at
four

say
my
host
,
suppress
a
groan
:
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
fancy
,
by
the
motion
of
his
arm
's
shadow
,
dash
a
tear
from
his
eye

<EOS>
Mr.

he
add
,

you
may
go

I
obey
,
so
far
as
to
quit
the
chamber
;
when
,
ignorant
where
the
narrow
lobby
lead
,
I
stand
still
,
and
be
witness
,
involuntarily
,
to
a
piece
of
superstition
on
the
part

my
landlord
which
belie
,
oddly
,
his
apparent
sense

He
get
on
to

wrench
open
the
lattice

burst

as

at
it

into

<EOS>
the
spectre
show
a
spectre
's
ordinary
caprice
:
it
give
no
sign
of
be
;
but
the
snow
and
wind
whirl
wildly
through
,
even
reach
my
station
,
and
blow
out
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
anguish
in
the
gush
of
grief
that
accompany
this
raving
,
that
my
compassion
make
me
overlook
its
folly
,
and
I
draw
off
,
half
angry
to
have
listen
at
all
,
and
vex
at
have
relate
my
ridiculous
nightmare
,
since
it
produce
that
agony
;
though
_
why
_
be
beyond
my
comprehension

<EOS>
I
descend
cautiously
to
the
low
region
,
and
land
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
where
a
gleam
of
fire

rake
compactly
together

enable

to
rekindle
my

nothing

except
a
brindle

grey
cat

creep
from
the
ashe
,

salute
me
with
a
querulous
mew

<EOS>
two
bench
,
shape
in
section
of
a
circle
,
nearly
enclose
the
hearth
;
on
one
of

I
stretch
myself

mount
the
other

ere

shuffle
down
a
wooden
ladder
that
vanish
in
the
roof

through
a
trap

the
ascent
to
his
garret

I
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
cast
a
sinister
look
at
the
little
flame
which
I
have
entice
to
play
between
the
rib
,
sweep
the
cat
from
its
elevation
,
and
bestow
himself
in
the
vacancy
,
commence
the
operation
of
stuff
a
three

inch
pipe
with
tobacco
.
<EOS>
My
presence
in
his
sanctum
be
evidently
esteem
a
piece
of
impudence
too
shameful
for
remark
:
he
silently
apply
the
tube
to
his
lip
,
fold
his
arm
,
and
puff
away
.
<EOS>
I
let
him
enjoy
the
luxury
unannoye

after
suck
out
his
last
wreath

heave
a
profound
sigh

he
get
up
,
and
depart
as
solemnly
as
he
come

a
more
elastic
footstep
enter
next
;

now
I
open
my
mouth
for
a
"
good

morning

close
it
again
,
the
salutation
unachieved
;
for
Hareton
Earnshaw
be
perform
his
orison
_
sotto
voce

,
in
a
series
of
curse
direct
against
every
object
he
touch
,
while
he
rummage
a
corner
for
a
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
through
the
drift
.
<EOS>
He
glance
over
the
back
of
the
bench
,
dilate
his
nostril
,
and
think
as
little
of
exchange
civility
with
me
as
with
my
companion
the
cat
.
<EOS>
I
guess
,
by
his
preparation
,
that
egress
be
allow
,
and
,
leave
my
hard
couch
,
make
a
movement
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
He
notice
this
,
and
thrust
at
an
inner
door
with
the
end
of
his
spade
,
intimate
by
an
inarticulate
sound
that
there
be
the
place
where
I
must
go
,
if
I
change
my
locality
.
  
<EOS>
It
open
into
the
house
,
where
the
female
be
already
astir
;
<EOS>
Zillah
urge
flake
of
flame
up
the
chimney
with
a
colossal
bellow
;
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
kneel
on
the
hearth
,
read
a
book
by
the
aid
of
the
blaze
.
<EOS>
She
hold
her
hand
interpose
between
the
furnace
-
heat
and
her
eye
,
and
seem
absorb
in
her
occupation
;
desist
from
it
only
to
chide
the
servant
for
cover
her
with
spark
,
or
to
push
away
a
dog
,
now
and
then
,
that
snoozle
its
nose
overforwardly
into
her
face

I
be
surprised
to
see
Heathcliff
there
also

<EOS>
He
stand
by
the
fire
,
his
back
towards
me
,
just
finish
a
stormy
scene
with
poor
Zillah
;
who
ever
and
anon
interrupt
her
labour
to
pluck
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
,
and
heave
an
indignant
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"

you

you
worthless

he
break
out
as
I
enter
,
turn
to
his
daughter
-
in

law
,
and
employ
an
epithet
as
harmless
as
duck
,
or
sheep
,
but
generally
represent
by
a
dash
 
.

there
you
be

at

trick
again

answer
the
young
lady

close
her

throw
it
on

anything

your

out

<EOS>
Heathcliff
lift
his
hand
,
and
the
speaker
spring
to
a
safe
distance
,
obviously
acquaint
with
its
weight
.
<EOS>
have
no
desire
to
be
entertain
by
a
cat

-
dog
combat

I
step
forward
briskly
,
as
if
eager
to
partake
the
warmth
of
the
hearth
,
and
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
the
interrupted
dispute
.
<EOS>
each
have
enough
decorum
to
suspend
further
hostility
:
Heathcliff
place
his
fist
,
out
of
temptation
,
in
his
pocket
;
Mrs.
Heathcliff
curl
her
lip
,
and
walk
to
a
seat
far
off
,
where
she
keep
her
word
by
play
the
part
of
a
statue
during
the
remainder
of
my
stay
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
long
.
<EOS>
I
decline
join
their
breakfast
,
and
,
at
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
,
take
an
opportunity
of
escape
into
the
free
air
,
now
clear
,
and
still
,
and
cold
as
impalpable
ice
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlord
halloed
for
me
to
stop
ere
<EOS>
I
reach
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
offer
to
accompany
me
across
the
moor
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
he
do
,
for
the
whole
hill
-
back
be
one
billowy
,
white
ocean
;
the
swell
and
fall
not
indicate
corresponding
rise
and
depression
in

blot
from
the
chart
which
my
yesterday
's
walk
leave
picture
in

I
have
remark
on
one
side

the
road

at
interval
of
six

seven
yard

a
line
of
upright
stone

daub

lime
on
purpose
to
serve
as
guide
in
the
dark

and
also
when
a
fall
,
like
the
present
,
confound
the
deep
swamp
on
either
hand
with
the
firm
path
:
but
,
except
a
dirty
dot
point
up
here
and
there
,
all
trace
of
their
existence
have
vanish
:
and
my
companion
find
it
necessary
to
warn
me
frequently
to
steer
to
the
right
or
leave
,
<EOS>
when
I
imagine
I
be
follow
,
correctly
,
the
winding
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
We
exchange
little
conversation
,
and
he
halt
at
the
entrance
of
Thrushcross
Park
,
say
,
I
could
make
no
error
there
.
<EOS>
Our
adieux
be
limit
to
a
hasty
bow
,
and
then
I
push
forward
,
trust
to
my
own
resource
;
for
the
porter
's
lodge
be
untenanted
as
yet
.
<EOS>
the
distance
from
the
gate
to
the
grange
be
two
mile
;
I
believe
I
manage
to
make
it
four
,
<EOS>
what
with
lose
myself
among
the
tree
,
and
sink
up
to
the
neck
in
snow
:
<EOS>
a
predicament
which
only
those
who
have
experience
it
can
appreciate
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
whatever
be
my
wandering
,
the
clock
chime
twelve
as
I
enter
the
house
;
and
that
give
exactly
an
hour
for
every
mile
of
the
usual
way
from
Wuthering
Heights
.
  
<EOS>
My
human
fixture
and
her
satellite
rush
to
welcome
me
;
exclaim
,
tumultuously
<EOS>
,
they
have
completely
give
me
up
:
everybody
conjecture
that
I
perish
last
night
;
and
they
be
wonder
how
they
must
set
about
the
search
for
my
remain
.
<EOS>
I
bid
them
be
quiet
,
now
that
they
see
me
returned
,
and
,
benumb
to
my
very
heart
<EOS>
,
I
drag
up
-
stair
;
whence
,
after
put
on
dry
clothe
,
and
pace
to
and
fro
thirty
or
forty
minute
,
to
restore
the
animal
heat
,
I
adjourn
to
my
study
,
feeble
as
a
kitten
:
almost
too
much
so
to
enjoy
the
cheerful
fire
and
smoking
coffee
which
the
servant
have
prepare
for
my
refreshment
.
    
<EOS>
what
vain
weathercock
we
be
!
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
determine
to
hold
myself
independent
of
all
social
intercourse
,
and
thank
my
star
that
,
at
length
,
I
have
light
on
a
spot
where
it
be
next
to
impracticable
 
I
,
weak
wretch
,
after
maintain
till
dusk
a
struggle
with
low
spirit
and
solitude
,
be
finally
compel
to
strike
my
colour
;
and
under
pretence
of
gain
information
concern
the
necessity
of
my
establishment
,
I
desire
Mrs.
Dean
,
when
she
bring
in
supper
,
to
sit
down
while
I
eat
it
;
hope
sincerely
she
would
prove
a
regular
gossip
,
and
either
rouse
me
to
animation
or
lull
me
to
sleep
by
her
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
live
here
a
considerable
time
,
"
I
commence
;
"
do
you
not
say
sixteen
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
eighteen
,
sir
:
<EOS>
I
come
when
the
mistress
be
marry
,
to
wait
on
her
;
after
she
die
,
the
master
retain
me
for
his
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
ensue
a
pause
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
gossip
,
I
fear
;
unless
about
her
own
affair
,
and
those
could
hardly
interest
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
have
study
for
an
interval
,
with
a
fist
on
either
knee
,
and
a
cloud
of
meditation
over
her
ruddy
countenance
,
she
ejaculate
 
"
ah
,
time
be
greatly
change
since
then
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
remark
,
"
you
have
see
a
good
many
alteration
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
:
and
trouble
too
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
turn
the
talk
on
my
landlord
's
family
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
a
good
subject
to
start
!
<EOS>
and
that
pretty
girl
-
widow
,
I
should
like
to
know
her
history
:
whether
she
be
a
native
of
the
country
,
or
,
as
be
more
probable
,
an
exotic
that
the
surly
_
indigenae
_
will
not
recognise
for
kin
.
"
<EOS>
with
this
intention
I
ask
Mrs.
Dean
why
Heathcliff
let
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
prefer
live
in
a
situation
and
residence
so
much
inferior
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
he
not
rich
enough
to
keep
the
estate
in
good
order

I
inquire

<EOS>
"
Rich
,
sir

<EOS>
she
return
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
nobody
know
what
money
,
and
every
year
it
increase
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
he
be
rich
enough
to
live
in
a
fine
house
than
this
:
but
he
be
very
near
 
close
-
handed
;
and
,
if
he
have
mean
to
flit
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
as
soon
as
he
hear
of
a
good
tenant
he
could
not
have
bear
to
miss
the
chance
of
get
a
few
hundred
more
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
people
should
be
so
greedy
,
when
they
be
alone
in
the
world

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He

what

Catherine
Linton

I
exclaim
,
astonish
.
<EOS>
but
a
minute
's
reflection
convince
me
it
be
not
my
ghostly
Catherine

<EOS>
then
,

I
continue

I

"
<EOS>
Mrs.

<EOS>
she
look
very
well

not

a

rough

<EOS>
the
less
you
meddle

well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

He
must
have
have
some
up

down
in
life

make
him
such
a
churl
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
anything
of
his
history
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
cuckoo
's
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
:
except
where
he
be
bear
,
and
who
be
his
parent
,
and
how
he
get
his
money
at
first

<EOS>

Hareton
have
be
cast
out

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mrs.

,
it
will
be
a
charitable
deed
to
tell
me
something
of
my
neighbour
:
<EOS>
I
feel
I
shall
not
rest
if
I
go
to
bed
;
so
be
good
enough
to
sit
and
chat
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
will
just
fetch
a
little
sewing
,
and
then
I
will
sit
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
catch
cold
<EOS>
:
I
see
you
shiver
,
and
you
must
have
some
gruel
to
drive
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
worthy
woman
bustle
off
,
and
I
crouch
near
the
fire
;
my
head
feel
hot
,
and
the
rest
of
me
chill
:
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
be
excited
,
almost
to
a
pitch
of
foolishness
,
through
my
nerve
and
brain
.
<EOS>
this
cause
me
to
feel
,
not
uncomfortable
,
but
rather
fearful
(
as
I
be
still
)
of
serious
effect
from
the
incident
of
to
-
day
and
yesterday
.
<EOS>
She
return
presently
,
bring
a
smoking
basin
and
a
basket
of
work
;
and
,
have
place
the
former
on
the
hob
,
draw
in
her
seat
,
evidently
please
to
find
me
so
companionable
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
come
to
live
here
,
she
commence
 
wait
no
farther
invitation
to
her
story
 
<EOS>
I
be
almost
always
at
Wuthering
Heights
;
because
my
mother
have
nurse
Mr.
Hindley
Earnshaw
,
that
be
Hareton
's
father
,
and
I
get
use
to
play
with
the
child
<EOS>
:
I
run
errand
too
,
and
help
to
make
hay
,
and
hang
about
the
farm
ready
for
anything
that
anybody
would
set
me
to
.
<EOS>
one
fine
summer
morning
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
beginning
of
harvest
,
I
remember
 
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
the
old
master
,
come
down
-
stair
,
dress
for
a
journey
;
and
,
after
he
have
tell
Joseph
what
be
to
be
do
during
the
day
,
he
turn
to
Hindley
,
and
Cathy
,
and
me
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
I
sit
eat
my
porridge
with
them
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
speak
to
his
son
,
"
now
,
my
bonny
man
,
I
be
go
to
Liverpool
to
-
day
,
what
shall
I
bring
you
?
<EOS>
You
may
choose
what
you
like
:
only
let
it
be
little
,
for
I
shall
walk
there
and
back
:
sixty
mile
each
way
<EOS>
,
that
be
a
long
spell
!
"
<EOS>
Hindley
name
a
fiddle
,
and
then
he
ask
Miss
Cathy
;
she
be
hardly
six
year
old
,
but
she
could
ride
any
horse
in
the
stable
,
and
she
choose
a
whip
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
forget
me
;
for
he
have
a
kind
heart
,
though
he
be
rather
severe
sometimes
.
<EOS>
He
promise
to
bring
me
a
pocketful
of
apple
and
pear
,
and
then
he
kiss
his
child
,
say
good
-
bye
,
and
set
off
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
a
long
while
to
us
all
 
the
three
day
of
his
absence
 
and
often
do
little
Cathy
ask
when
he
would
be
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Earnshaw
expect
him
by
supper
-
time
on
the
third
evening
,
and
she
put
the
meal
off
hour
after
hour
;
there
be
no
sign
of
his
come
,
however
,
and
at
last
the
child
get
tired
of
run
down
to
the
gate
to
look
.
<EOS>
then
it
grow
dark
;
she
would
have
have
them
to
bed
,
but
they
beg
sadly
to
be
allow
to
stay
up
;
and
,
just
about
eleven
o'clock
,
<EOS>
the
door
-
latch
be
raise
quietly
,
and
in
step
the
master
.
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
into
a
chair
,
laugh
and
groaning
,
and
bid
them
all
stand
off
,
for
he
be
nearly
kill
 
he
would
not
have
such
another
walk
for
the
three
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
at
the
end
of
it
to
be
flight
to
death
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
open
his
great
-
coat
,
which
he
hold
bundle
up
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
see
here
,
wife
!
<EOS>
I
be
never
so
beat
with
anything
in
my
life
:
but
you
must
e'en
take
it
as
a
gift
of
God
;
though
it
be
as
dark
almost
as
if
it
come
from
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
crowd
round
,
and
over
Miss
Cathy
's
head
I
have
a
peep
at
a
dirty
,
ragged
,
black
-
haired
child
;
big
enough
both
to
walk
and
talk
:
indeed
,
its
face
look
old
than
Catherine
's
;
yet
when
it
be
set
on
its
foot
,
it
only
stare
round
,
and
repeat
over
and
over
again
some
gibberish
that
nobody
could
understand
.
<EOS>
I
be
frightened
,
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
be
ready
to
fling
it
out
of
door
:
she
do
fly
up
,
ask
how
he
could
fashion
to
bring
that
gipsy
brat
into
the
house
,
when
they
have
their
own
bairn
to
feed
and
fend
for
?
<EOS>
what
he
mean
to
do
with
it
,
and
whether
he
be
mad
?
<EOS>
the
master
try
to
explain
the
matter
;
but
he
be
really
half
dead
with
fatigue
,
and
all
that
I
could
make
out
,
amongst
her
scolding
,
be
a
tale
of
his
see
it
starve
,
and
houseless
,
and
as
good
as
dumb
,
in
the
street
of
Liverpool
,
where
he
pick
it
up
and
inquire
for
its
owner
.
<EOS>
not
a
soul
know
to
whom
it
belong
,
he
say
;
and
his
money
and
time
be
both
limited
,
he
think
it
better
to
take
it
home
with
him
at
once
,
than
run
into
vain
expense
there
:
because
he
be
determine
he
would
not
leave
it
as
he
find
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
the
conclusion
be
,
that
my
mistress
grumble
herself
calm
;
and
Mr.
Earnshaw
tell
me
to
wash
it
,
and
give
it
clean
thing
,
and
let
it
sleep
with
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
Hindley
and
Cathy
content
themselves
with
look
and
listen
till
peace
be
restore
:
then
,
both
begin
search
their
father
's
pocket
for
the
present
he
have
promise
them
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
a
boy
of
fourteen
,
but
when
he
draw
out
what
have
be
a
fiddle
,
crush
to
morsel
in
the
great
-
coat
,
he
blubber
aloud
;
and
Cathy
,
when
she
learn
the
master
have
lose
her
whip
in
attend
on
the
stranger
,
show
her
humour
by
grin
and
spit
at
the
stupid
little
thing
;
earn
for
her
pain
a
sound
blow
from
her
father
,
to
teach
her
clean
manner
.
<EOS>
They
entirely
refuse
to
have
it
in
bed
with
them
,
or
even
in
their
room
;
and
I
have
no
more
sense
,
so
I
put
it
on
the
landing
of
the
stair
,
hope
it
may
be
go
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
by
chance
,
or
else
attract
by
hear
his
voice
,
it
creep
to
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
door
,
and
there
he
find
it
on
quit
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
inquiry
be
make
as
to
how
it
get
there
;
I
be
oblige
to
confess
,
and
in
recompense
for
my
cowardice
and
inhumanity
be
send
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
Heathcliff
's
first
introduction
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
on
come
back
a
few
day
afterwards
(
for
I
do
not
consider
my
banishment
perpetual
)
,
I
find
they
have
christen
him
"
Heathcliff
"
:
it
be
the
name
of
a
son
who
die
in
childhood
,
and
it
have
serve
him
ever
since
,
both
for
Christian
and
surname
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
<EOS>
and
he
be
now
very
thick
;
but
Hindley
hate
him
:
and
to
say
the
truth
I
do
the
same
;
and
we
plague
and
go
on
with
him
shamefully
:
for
I
be
not
reasonable
enough
to
feel
my
injustice
,
and
the
mistress
never
put
in
a
word
on
his
behalf
when
she
see
him
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
a
sullen
,
patient
child
;
harden
,
perhaps
,
to
ill
-
treatment
:
he
would
stand
Hindley
's
blow
without
wink
or
shed
a
tear
,
and
my
pinche
move
him
only
to
draw
in
a
breath
and
open
his
eye
,
as
if
he
have
hurt
himself
by
accident
,
and
nobody
be
to
blame
.
<EOS>
this
endurance
make
old
Earnshaw
furious
,
when
he
discover
his
son
persecute
the
poor
fatherless
child
,
as
he
call
him
.
<EOS>
He
take
to
Heathcliff
strangely
,
believe
all
he
say
(
for
that
matter
,
he
say
precious
little
,
and
generally
the
truth
)
,
and
pet
him
up
far
above
Cathy
,
who
be
too
mischievous
and
wayward
for
a
favourite
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
he
breed
bad
feeling
in
the
house
;
and
at
Mrs.
Earnshaw
's
death
,
which
happen
in
less
than
two
year
after
,
the
young
master
have
learn
to
regard
his
father
as
an
oppressor
rather
than
a
friend
,
and
Heathcliff
as
a
usurper
of
his
parent
's
affection
and
his
privilege
;
and
he
grow
bitter
with
brood
over
these
injury
.
<EOS>
I
sympathise
a
while
;
but
when
the
child
fall
ill
of
the
measle
,
and
I
have
to
tend
them
,
and
take
on
me
the
care
of
a
woman
at
once
,
I
change
my
idea
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
be
dangerously
sick
;
and
while
he
lie
at
the
bad
he
would
have
me
constantly
by
his
pillow
:
I
suppose
he
feel
I
do
a
good
deal
for
him
,
and
he
have
not
wit
to
guess
that
I
be
compel
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
say
this
,
he
be
the
quiet
child
that
ever
nurse
watch
over
.
<EOS>
the
difference
between
him
and
the
other
force
me
to
be
less
partial
.
<EOS>
Cathy
and
her
brother
harass
me
terribly
:
he
be
as
uncomplaining
as
a
lamb
;
though
hardness
,
not
gentleness
,
make
him
give
little
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
He
get
through
,
and
the
doctor
affirm
it
be
in
a
great
measure
owe
to
me
,
and
praise
me
for
my
care
.
<EOS>
I
be
vain
of
his
commendation
,
and
soften
towards
the
being
by
whose
mean
I
earn
them
,
and
thus
Hindley
lose
his
last
ally
:
still
I
could
not
dote
on
Heathcliff
,
and
I
wonder
often
what
my
master
see
to
admire
so
much
in
the
sullen
boy
;
who
never
,
to
my
recollection
,
repay
his
indulgence
by
any
sign
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
insolent
to
his
benefactor
,
he
be
simply
insensible
;
though
know
perfectly
the
hold
he
have
on
his
heart
,
and
conscious
he
have
only
to
speak
and
all
the
house
would
be
oblige
to
bend
to
his
wish
.
<EOS>
as
an
instance
,
I
remember
Mr.
Earnshaw
once
buy
a
couple
of
colt
at
the
parish
fair
,
and
give
the
lad
each
one
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
take
the
handsome
,
but
it
soon
fall
lame
,
and
when
he
discover
it
,
he
say
to
Hindley
    
<EOS>
"
You
must
exchange
horse
with
me
:
I
do
not
like
mine
;
and
if
you
will
not
I
shall
tell
your
father
of
the
three
thrashing
you
have
give
me
this
week
,
and
show
him
my
arm
,
which
be
black
to
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hindley
put
out
his
tongue
,
and
cuff
him
over
the
ear
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
better
do
it
at
once
,
"
he
persist
,
escape
to
the
porch
(
they
be
in
the
stable
)
:
"
you
will
have
to
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
speak
of
these
blow
,
you
will
get
them
again
with
interest
.
"
<EOS>
"
off
,
dog
!
"
cry
Hindley
,
threaten
him
with
an
iron
weight
use
for
weigh
potato
and
hay
.
"
<EOS>
throw
it
,
"
he
reply
,
stand
still
,
"
and
then
I
will
tell
how
you
boast
that
you
would
turn
me
out
of
door
as
soon
as
he
die
,
and
see
whether
he
will
not
turn
you
out
directly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hindley
throw
it
,
hit
him
on
the
breast
,
and
down
he
fall
,
but
stagger
up
immediately
,
breathless
and
white
;
and
,
have
not
I
prevent
it
,
he
would
have
go
just
so
to
the
master
,
and
get
full
revenge
by
let
his
condition
plead
for
him
,
intimate
who
have
cause
it
.
<EOS>
"
take
my
colt
,
Gipsy
,
then
!
"
say
young
Earnshaw
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
pray
that
he
may
break
your
neck
:
take
him
,
and
be
damn
,
you
beggarly
interloper
!
<EOS>
and
wheedle
my
father
out
of
all
he
have
<EOS>
:
only
afterwards
show
him
what
you
be
,
imp
of
Satan
.
 
<EOS>
and
take
that
<EOS>
,
I
hope
he
will
kick
out
your
brain
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
have
go
to
loose
the
beast
,
and
shift
it
to
his
own
stall
;
he
be
pass
behind
it
,
when
Hindley
finish
his
speech
by
knock
him
under
its
foot
,
and
without
stop
to
examine
whether
his
hope
be
fulfil
,
run
away
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
witness
how
coolly
the
child
gather
himself
up
,
and
go
on
with
his
intention
;
exchange
saddle
and
all
,
and
then
sit
down
on
a
bundle
of
hay
to
overcome
the
qualm
which
the
violent
blow
occasion
,
before
he
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
persuade
him
easily
to
let
me
lay
the
blame
of
his
bruise
on
the
horse
:
he
mind
little
what
tale
be
tell
since
he
have
what
he
want
.
<EOS>
He
complain
so
seldom
,
indeed
,
of
such
stir
as
these
,
that
I
really
think
him
not
vindictive
:
I
be
deceive
completely
,
as
you
will
hear
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
time
Mr.
Earnshaw
begin
to
fail
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
active
and
healthy
,
yet
his
strength
leave
him
suddenly
;
and
when
he
be
confine
to
the
chimney
-
corner
he
grow
grievously
irritable
.
<EOS>
a
nothing
vex
him
;
and
suspect
slight
of
his
authority
nearly
throw
him
into
fit
.
<EOS>
this
be
especially
to
be
remark
<EOS>
if
any
one
attempt
to
impose
upon
,
or
domineer
over
,
his
favourite
:
he
be
painfully
jealous
lest
a
word
should
be
speak
amiss
to
him
;
seem
to
have
get
into
his
head
the
notion
that
,
because
he
like
Heathcliff
,
all
hate
,
and
long
to
do
him
an
ill
-
turn
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
disadvantage
to
the
lad
;
for
the
kinder
among
us
do
not
wish
to
fret
the
master
,
so
we
humour
his
partiality
;
and
that
humouring
be
rich
nourishment
to
the
child
's
pride
and
black
temper
.
<EOS>
still
it
become
in
a
manner
necessary
;
twice
,
or
thrice
,
Hindley
's
manifestation
of
scorn
,
while
his
father
be
near
,
rouse
the
old
man
to
a
fury
:
he
seize
his
stick
to
strike
him
,
and
shake
with
rage
that
he
could
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
our
curate
(
we
have
a
curate
then
who
make
the
living
answer
by
teach
the
little
Lintons
and
Earnshaws
,
and
farm
his
bit
of
land
himself
)
advise
that
the
young
man
should
be
send
to
college
;
and
Mr.
Earnshaw
agree
,
though
with
a
heavy
spirit
,
for
he
say
 
"
Hindley
be
nought
,
and
would
never
thrive
as
where
he
wander
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
hope
heartily
we
should
have
peace
now
.
<EOS>
It
hurt
me
to
think
the
master
should
be
make
uncomfortable
by
his
own
good
deed
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
the
discontent
of
age
and
disease
arise
from
his
family
disagreement
;
as
he
would
have
it
that
it
do
:
really
,
you
know
,
sir
,
it
be
in
his
sinking
frame
.
<EOS>
We
may
have
get
on
tolerably
,
notwithstanding
,
but
for
two
people
 
Miss
Cathy
,
and
Joseph
,
the
servant
<EOS>
:
you
see
him
,
I
daresay
,
up
yonder
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
and
be
yet
most
likely
,
the
wearisome
self
-
righteous
Pharisee
that
ever
ransack
a
Bible
to
rake
the
promise
to
himself
and
fle
the
curse
to
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
by
his
knack
of
sermonise
and
pious
discoursing
,
he
contrive
to
make
a
great
impression
on
Mr.
Earnshaw
;
and
the
more
feeble
the
master
become
,
the
more
influence
he
gain
.
<EOS>
He
be
relentless
in
worry
him
about
his
soul
's
concern
,
and
about
rule
his
child
rigidly
.
<EOS>
He
encourage
him
to
regard
Hindley
as
a
reprobate
;
and
,
night
after
night
,
he
regularly
grumble
out
a
long
string
of
tale
against
Heathcliff
and
Catherine
:
always
mind
to
flatter
Earnshaw
's
weakness
by
heap
the
heavy
blame
on
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
she
have
way
with
her
such
as
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
child
take
up
before
;
and
she
put
all
of
us
past
our
patience
fifty
time
and
oftener
in
a
day
:
from
the
hour
she
come
down
-
stair
till
the
hour
she
go
to
bed
,
we
have
not
a
minute
's
security
that
she
would
not
be
in
mischief
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
be
always
at
high
-
water
mark
,
her
tongue
always
go
 
singing
,
laughing
,
and
plague
everybody
who
would
not
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
a
wild
,
wicked
slip
<EOS>
she
be
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
the
bonny
eye
,
the
sweetest
smile
,
and
light
foot
in
the
parish
:
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
I
believe
she
mean
no
harm
;
for
when
once
she
make
you
cry
in
good
earnest
,
it
seldom
happen
that
she
would
not
keep
you
company
,
and
oblige
you
to
be
quiet
that
you
may
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
much
too
fond
of
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
the
great
punishment
we
could
invent
for
her
be
to
keep
her
separate
from
him
:
yet
she
get
chide
more
than
any
of
us
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
in
play
,
she
like
exceedingly
to
act
the
little
mistress
;
use
her
hand
freely
,
and
command
her
companion
:
she
do
so
to
me
,
but
I
would
not
bear
slap
and
ordering
;
and
so
I
let
her
know
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
do
not
understand
joke
from
his
child
:
he
have
always
be
strict
and
grave
with
them
;
and
Catherine
,
on
her
part
,
have
no
idea
why
her
father
should
be
crosser
and
less
patient
in
his
ail
condition
than
he
be
in
his
prime
.
<EOS>
His
peevish
reproofs
waken
in
her
a
naughty
delight
to
provoke
him
:
she
be
never
so
happy
as
when
we
be
all
scold
her
at
once
,
and
she
defy
us
with
her
bold
,
saucy
look
,
and
her
ready
word
;
turn
Joseph
's
religious
curse
into
ridicule
,
bait
me
,
and
do
just
what
her
father
hate
most
 
show
how
her
pretended
insolence
,
which
he
think
real
,
have
more
power
over
Heathcliff
than
his
kindness
:
how
the
boy
would
do
_
<EOS>
her
_
bid
in
anything
,
and
_
<EOS>
his
_
<EOS>
only
when
it
suit
his
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
after
behave
as
badly
as
possible
all
day
,
she
sometimes
come
fondle
to
make
it
up
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
Cathy
,
"
the
old
man
would
say
,
"
I
can
not
love
thee
,
thou'rt
bad
than
thy
brother
.
<EOS>
go
,
say
thy
prayer
,
child
,
and
ask
God
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
thy
mother
<EOS>
and
I
must
rue
that
we
ever
rear
thee
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
make
her
cry
,
at
first
;
and
then
be
repulse
continually
harden
her
,
and
she
laugh
if
I
tell
her
to
say
she
be
sorry
for
her
fault
,
and
beg
to
be
forgive
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
hour
come
,
at
last
,
that
end
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
trouble
on
earth
.
<EOS>
He
die
quietly
in
his
chair
one
October
evening
,
seat
by
the
fire
-
side
.
<EOS>
a
high
wind
bluster
round
the
house
,
and
roar
in
the
chimney
:
it
sound
wild
and
stormy
,
yet
it
be
not
cold
,
and
we
be
all
together
 
I
,
a
little
remove
from
the
hearth
,
busy
at
my
knitting
,
and
Joseph
read
his
Bible
near
the
table
(
for
the
servant
generally
sit
in
the
house
then
,
after
their
work
be
do
)
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
have
be
sick
,
and
that
make
her
still
;
she
lean
against
her
father
's
knee
,
and
Heathcliff
be
lie
on
the
floor
with
his
head
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
master
,
before
he
fall
into
a
doze
,
stroke
her
bonny
hair
 
<EOS>
it
please
him
rarely
to
see
her
gentle
 
and
say
,
"
why
canst
thou
not
always
be
a
good
lass
,
Cathy
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
turn
her
face
up
to
his
,
and
laugh
,
and
answer
,
"
why
can
not
you
always
be
a
good
man
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
she
see
him
vexed
again
,
she
kiss
his
hand
,
and
say
she
would
sing
him
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
She
begin
singe
very
low
,
till
his
finger
drop
from
hers
,
and
his
head
sink
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
then
I
tell
her
to
hush
,
and
not
stir
,
for
fear
she
should
wake
him
.
<EOS>
We
all
keep
as
mute
as
mouse
a
full
half
-
hour
,
and
should
have
do
so
longer
,
only
Joseph
,
have
finish
his
chapter
,
get
up
and
say
that
he
must
rouse
the
master
for
prayer
and
bed
.
<EOS>
He
step
forward
,
and
call
him
by
name
,
and
touch
his
shoulder
;
but
he
would
not
move
:
so
he
take
the
candle
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
something
wrong
as
he
set
down
the
light
;
and
seize
the
child
each
by
an
arm
,
whisper
them
to
"
frame
up
-
stair
,
and
make
little
din
 
<EOS>
they
may
pray
alone
that
evening
 
he
have
summut
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
bid
father
good
-
night
first
,
"
say
Catherine
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
before
we
could
hinder
her
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
discover
her
loss
directly
 
<EOS>
she
scream
out
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
be
dead
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
he
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
both
set
up
a
heart
-
break
cry
.
  
<EOS>
I
join
my
wail
to
theirs
,
loud
and
bitter
;
but
Joseph
ask
what
we
could
be
think
of
to
roar
in
that
way
over
a
saint
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
to
put
on
my
cloak
and
run
to
Gimmerton
for
the
doctor
and
the
parson
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
guess
the
use
that
either
would
be
of
,
then
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
,
through
wind
and
rain
,
and
bring
one
,
the
doctor
,
back
with
me
;
the
other
say
he
would
come
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
leave
Joseph
to
explain
matter
,
I
run
to
the
child
's
room
:
their
door
be
ajar
,
I
see
they
have
never
lain
down
,
though
it
be
past
midnight
;
but
they
be
calm
,
and
do
not
need
me
to
console
them
.
<EOS>
the
little
soul
be
comfort
each
other
with
well
thought
than
I
could
have
hit
on
:
no
parson
in
the
world
ever
picture
heaven
so
beautifully
as
they
do
,
in
their
innocent
talk
;
and
,
while
I
sob
and
listen
,
I
could
not
help
wish
we
be
all
there
safe
together
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
come
home
to
the
funeral
;
and
 
a
thing
that
amaze
us
,
and
set
the
neighbour
gossip
right
and
leave
 
he
bring
a
wife
with
him
.
<EOS>
what
she
be
,
and
where
she
be
bear
,
he
never
inform
us
:
<EOS>
probably
,
she
have
neither
money
nor
name
to
recommend
her
,
or
he
would
scarcely
have
keep
the
union
from
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
one
that
would
have
disturb
the
house
much
on
her
own
account
.
<EOS>
every
object
she
see
,
the
moment
she
cross
the
threshold
,
appear
to
delight
her
;
and
every
circumstance
that
take
place
about
her
:
except
the
prepare
for
the
burial
,
and
the
presence
of
the
mourner
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
half
silly
,
from
her
behaviour
while
that
go
on
:
she
run
into
her
chamber
,
and
make
me
come
with
her
,
though
I
should
have
be
dress
the
child
:
and
there
she
sit
shiver
and
clasp
her
hand
,
and
ask
repeatedly
 
"
be
they
go
yet
?
"
<EOS>
then
she
begin
describe
with
hysterical
emotion
the
effect
it
produce
on
her
to
see
black
;
and
start
,
and
tremble
,
and
,
at
last
,
fall
a
-
weeping
 
and
<EOS>
when
I
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
answer
,
she
do
not
know
;
but
she
feel
so
afraid
of
die
!
<EOS>
I
imagine
her
as
little
likely
to
die
as
myself
.
<EOS>
She
be
rather
thin
,
but
young
,
and
fresh
-
complexioned
,
and
her
eye
sparkle
as
bright
as
diamond
.
<EOS>
I
do
remark
,
to
be
sure
,
that
mount
the
stair
make
her
breathe
very
quick
;
that
the
least
sudden
noise
set
her
all
in
a
quiver
,
and
that
she
cough
troublesomely
sometimes
:
but
I
know
nothing
of
what
these
symptom
portend
,
and
have
no
impulse
to
sympathise
with
her
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
in
general
take
to
foreigner
here
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
unless
they
take
to
us
first
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Earnshaw
be
alter
considerably
in
the
three
year
of
his
absence
.
<EOS>
He
have
grow
sparer
,
and
lose
his
colour
,
and
speak
and
dress
quite
differently
;
and
,
on
the
very
day
of
his
return
,
he
tell
Joseph
and
me
we
must
thenceforth
quarter
ourselves
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
and
leave
the
house
for
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
would
have
carpet
and
paper
a
small
spare
room
for
a
parlour
;
but
his
wife
express
such
pleasure
at
the
white
floor
and
huge
glowing
fireplace
,
at
the
pewter
dish
and
delf
-
case
,
and
dog
-
kennel
,
and
the
wide
space
there
be
to
move
about
in
where
they
usually
sit
,
that
he
think
it
unnecessary
to
her
comfort
,
and
so
drop
the
intention
.
  
<EOS>
She
express
pleasure
,
too
,
at
find
a
sister
among
her
new
acquaintance
;
and
she
prattle
to
Catherine
,
and
kiss
her
,
and
run
about
with
her
,
and
give
her
quantity
of
present
,
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
tire
very
soon
,
however
,
and
when
she
grow
peevish
,
Hindley
become
tyrannical
.
<EOS>
a
few
word
from
her
,
evince
a
dislike
to
Heathcliff
,
be
enough
to
rouse
in
him
all
his
old
hatred
of
the
boy
.
<EOS>
He
drive
him
from
their
company
to
the
servant
,
deprive
him
of
the
instruction
of
the
curate
,
and
insist
that
he
should
labour
out
of
door
instead
;
compel
him
to
do
so
as
hard
as
any
other
lad
on
the
farm
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
bear
his
degradation
pretty
well
at
first
,
because
Cathy
teach
him
what
she
learn
,
and
work
or
play
with
him
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
They
both
promise
fair
to
grow
up
as
rude
as
savage
;
the
young
master
be
entirely
negligent
how
they
behave
,
and
what
they
do
,
so
they
keep
clear
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
have
see
after
their
go
to
church
on
Sundays
,
only
Joseph
and
the
curate
reprimand
his
carelessness
when
they
absent
themselves
;
and
that
remind
him
to
order
Heathcliff
a
flogging
,
and
Catherine
a
fast
from
dinner
or
supper
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
one
of
their
chief
amusement
to
run
away
to
the
moor
in
the
morning
and
remain
there
all
day
,
and
the
after
punishment
grow
a
mere
thing
to
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
the
curate
may
set
as
many
chapter
as
he
please
for
Catherine
to
get
by
heart
,
and
Joseph
may
thrash
Heathcliff
till
his
arm
ache
;
they
forget
everything
the
minute
they
be
together
again
:
at
least
the
minute
they
have
contrive
some
naughty
plan
of
revenge
;
and
many
a
time
I
have
cry
to
myself
to
watch
them
grow
more
reckless
daily
,
and
I
not
daring
to
speak
a
syllable
,
for
fear
of
lose
the
small
power
I
still
retain
over
the
unfriended
creature
.
<EOS>
one
Sunday
evening
,
it
chance
that
they
be
banish
from
the
sitting
-
room
,
for
make
a
noise
,
or
a
light
offence
of
the
kind
;
and
when
I
go
to
call
them
to
supper
,
I
could
discover
them
nowhere
.
<EOS>
We
search
the
house
,
above
and
below
,
and
the
yard
and
stable
;
they
be
invisible
:
and
,
at
last
,
Hindley
in
a
passion
tell
us
to
bolt
the
door
,
and
swear
nobody
should
let
them
in
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
household
go
to
bed
;
and
I
,
too
,
anxious
to
lie
down
,
open
my
lattice
and
put
my
head
out
to
hearken
,
though
it
rain
:
determine
to
admit
them
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
,
should
they
return
.
<EOS>
in
a
while
,
I
distinguish
step
come
up
the
road
,
and
the
light
of
a
lantern
glimmer
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
I
throw
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
run
to
prevent
them
from
wake
Mr.
Earnshaw
by
knock
.
<EOS>
there
be
Heathcliff
,
by
himself
:
it
give
me
a
start
to
see
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Miss
Catherine
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
hurriedly
.
"
<EOS>
no
accident
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
"
at
Thrushcross
Grange
,
"
he
answer
;
"
and
I
would
have
be
there
too
,
but
they
have
not
the
manner
to
ask
me
to
stay
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
will
catch
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
:
"
you
will
never
be
content
till
you
be
send
about
your
business
.
<EOS>
what
in
the
world
lead
you
wander
to
Thrushcross
grange
?
"
<EOS>
"
let
me
get
off
my
wet
clothe
,
and
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
,
<EOS>
nelly
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
I
bid
him
beware
of
rouse
the
master
,
and
while
he
undress
<EOS>
and
I
wait
to
put
out
the
candle
<EOS>
,
he
continue
 
<EOS>
"
Cathy
and
I
escape
from
the
wash
-
house
to
have
a
ramble
at
liberty
,
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
Grange
light
,
we
think
we
would
just
go
and
see
whether
the
Lintons
pass
their
Sunday
evening
stand
shiver
in
corner
,
while
their
father
and
mother
sit
eat
and
drink
,
and
singe
and
laughing
,
and
burn
their
eye
out
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
they
do
?
<EOS>
or
read
sermon
,
and
be
catechise
by
their
manservant
,
and
set
to
learn
a
column
of
scripture
name
,
if
they
do
not
answer
properly
?
"
<EOS>
"
probably
not
,
"
I
respond
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
good
child
,
no
doubt
,
and
do
not
deserve
the
treatment
you
receive
,
for
your
bad
conduct
.
"
"
do
not
can
not
,
nelly
,
"
he
say
:
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
We
run
from
the
top
of
the
Heights
to
the
park
,
without
stop
 
Catherine
completely
beat
in
the
race
,
because
she
be
barefoot
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
seek
for
her
shoe
in
the
bog
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
creep
through
a
broken
hedge
,
grope
our
way
up
the
path
,
and
plant
ourselves
on
a
flower
-
plot
under
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
the
light
come
from
thence
;
they
have
not
put
up
the
shutter
,
and
the
curtain
be
only
half
closed
.
<EOS>
both
of
us
be
able
to
look
in
by
stand
on
the
basement
,
and
cling
to
the
ledge
,
and
we
see
 
ah
!
<EOS>
it
be
beautiful
 
a
splendid
place
carpet
with
crimson
,
and
crimson
-
cover
chair
and
table
,
and
a
pure
white
ceiling
border
by
gold
,
a
shower
of
glass
-
drop
hang
in
silver
chain
from
the
centre
,
and
shimmer
with
little
soft
taper
.
<EOS>
old
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Linton
be
not
there
;
Edgar
and
his
sister
have
it
entirely
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Should
not
they
have
be
happy
?
<EOS>
We
should
have
think
ourselves
in
heaven
!
<EOS>
and
now
,
guess
what
your
good
child
be
do
?
<EOS>
Isabella
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
eleven
,
a
year
young
than
Cathy
 
lie
scream
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
shriek
as
if
witch
be
run
red
-
hot
needle
into
her
.
<EOS>
Edgar
stand
on
the
hearth
weeping
silently
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
table
sit
a
little
dog
,
shake
its
paw
and
yelping
;
which
,
from
their
mutual
accusation
,
we
understand
they
have
nearly
pull
in
two
between
them
.
<EOS>
the
idiot
!
<EOS>
that
be
their
pleasure
!
<EOS>
to
quarrel
who
should
hold
a
heap
of
warm
hair
,
and
each
begin
to
cry
because
both
,
after
struggle
to
get
it
,
refuse
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
We
laugh
outright
at
the
pet
thing
;
we
do
despise
them
!
<EOS>
when
would
you
catch
me
wish
to
have
what
Catherine
want
?
<EOS>
or
find
us
by
ourselves
,
seek
entertainment
in
yelling
,
and
sob
,
and
roll
on
the
ground
,
divide
by
the
whole
room
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
exchange
,
for
a
thousand
life
,
my
condition
here
,
for
Edgar
Linton
's
at
Thrushcross
Grange
 
not
if
I
may
have
the
privilege
of
fling
Joseph
off
the
high
gable
,
and
paint
the
house
-
front
with
Hindley
's
blood
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hush

hush

"
<EOS>
I
interrupt
.
<EOS>
"
still
you
have
not
tell
me
,
Heathcliff
,
how
Catherine
be
leave
behind
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
we
laugh
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
the
Lintons
hear
us
,
and
with
one
accord
they
shoot
like
arrow
to
the
door
;
there
be
silence
,
and
then
a
cry
,
"
oh

mamma

mamma

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
oh
,
mamma

come
here

<EOS>
oh

papa

oh
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
really
do
howl
out
something
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
We
make
frightful
noise
to
terrify
them
still
more
,
and
then
we
drop
off
the
ledge
,
because
somebody
be
draw
the
bar
,
and
we
feel
we
have
better
flee
.
<EOS>
I
have
Cathy
by
the
hand
,
and
be
urge
her
on
,
when
all
at
once
she
fall
down
.
<EOS>
"
Run
,
Heathcliff
,
run
!
"
<EOS>
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
let
the
bull

dog
loose
,
and
he
hold
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
devil
have
seize
her
ankle
,
nelly
:
I
hear
his
abominable
snorting
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
yell
out
 
no
!
<EOS>
she
would
have
scorn
to
do
it
,
if
she
have
be
spit
on
the
horn
of
a
mad
cow
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
though
:
I
vociferate
curse
enough
to
annihilate
any
fiend
in
Christendom
;
and
I
get
a
stone
and
thrust
it
between
his
jaw
,
and
try
with
all
my
might
to
cram
it
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
a
beast
of
a
servant
come
up
with
a
lantern
,
at
last
,
shout
 
"
keep
fast
,
Skulker
,
keep
fast
!
"
<EOS>
He
change
his
note
,
however
,
when
he
see
Skulker
's
game
.
<EOS>
the
dog

throttle
off

purple
tongue

Oho
!

I
declare
he
be

my

neighbour
make

in

journey
to
Liverpool
 
a
little
Lascar
,

an
american

spanish
castaway

"
  
"
"
a
wicked
boy

at

"
remark
the
old
lady
,
"
and
quite
unfit
for
a
decent
house
!
<EOS>
do
you
notice
his
language
,
Linton
?
<EOS>
I
be
shocked
that
my
child
should
have
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recommence
cursing
 
do
not
be
angry
,
nelly
 
<EOS>
and
so
Robert
be
order
to
take
me
off
.
<EOS>
I
refuse
to
go
without
Cathy
;
he
drag
me
into
the
garden
,
push
the
lantern
into
my
hand
,
assure
me
that
Mr.
Earnshaw
should
be
inform
of
my
behaviour
,
and
,
bid
me
march
directly
,
secure
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
the
curtain
be
still
loop
up
at
one
corner
,
and
I
resume
my
station
as
spy
;
because
,
if
Catherine
have
wish
to
return
,
I
intend
shatter
their
great
glass
pan
to
a
million
of
fragment
,
unless
they
let
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
sit
on
the
sofa
quietly
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
take
off
the
grey
cloak
of
the
dairy
-
maid
which
we
have
borrow
for
our
excursion
,
shake
her
head
and
expostulate
with
her
,
I
suppose
:
she
be
a
young
lady
,
and
they
make
a
distinction
between
her
treatment
and
mine
.
<EOS>
then
the
woman
-
servant
bring
a
basin
of
warm
water
,
and
wash
her
foot
;
and
Mr.
Linton
mix
a
tumbler
of
negus
,
and
Isabella
empty
a
plateful
of
cake
into
her
lap
,
and
Edgar
stand
gape
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
they
dry
and
comb
her
beautiful
hair
,
and
give
her
a
pair
of
enormous
slipper
,
and
wheel
her
to
the
fire
;
and
I
leave
her
,
as
merry
as
she
could
be
,
divide
her
food
between
the
little
dog
and
Skulker
,
whose
nose
she
pinch
as
he
eat
;
and
kindle
a
spark
of
spirit
in
the
vacant
blue
eye
of
the
Lintons
 
a
dim
reflection
from
her
own
enchanting
face
.
<EOS>
I
see
they
be
full
of
stupid
admiration
;
she
be
so
immeasurably
superior
to
them
 
to
everybody
on
earth
,
be
she
not
,
nelly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
will
more
come
of
this
business
than
you
reckon
on
,
"
I
answer
,
cover
him
up
and
extinguish
the
light
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
incurable
,
Heathcliff
;
and
Mr.
Hindley
will
have
to
proceed
to
extremity
,
see
if
he
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
My
word
come
truer
than
I
desire
.
<EOS>
the
luckless
adventure
make
Earnshaw
furious
.
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Linton
,
to
mend
matter
,
pay
us
a
visit
himself
on
the
morrow
,
and
read
the
young
master
such
a
lecture
on
the
road
he
guide
his
family
,
that
he
be
stir
to
look
about
him
,
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
receive
no
flogging
,
but
he
be
tell
that
the
first
word
he
speak
to
Miss
Catherine
should
ensure
a
dismissal
;
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
undertake
to
keep
her
sister
-
in
-
law
in
due
restraint
when
she
return
home
;
employ
art
,
not
force
:
with
force
she
would
have
find
it
impossible
.
    
<EOS>
Cathy
stay
at
Thrushcross
Grange
five
week
:
till
Christmas
.
<EOS>
by
that
time
her
ankle
be
thoroughly
cure
,
and
her
manner
much
improve
.
<EOS>
the
mistress
visit
her
often
in
the
interval
,
and
commence
her
plan
of
reform
by
try
to
raise
her
self
-
respect
with
fine
clothe
and
flattery
,
which
she
take
readily
;
so
that
,
instead
of
a
wild
,
hatless
little
savage
jump
into
the
house
,
and
rush
to
squeeze
us
all
breathless
,
there
"
light
from
a
handsome
black
pony
a
very
dignified
person

with
brown

fall
from

and
a
long
cloth
habit

up
with
both

that

may
sail
in
.
<EOS>
Hindley
lift
her
from
her
horse
,
exclaim
delightedly
,
"
why
,
Cathy
,
you
be
quite
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
should
scarcely
have
know
you

Isabella

not

his

you
will
disarrange
your

let
me
untie
your
hat

"
  
<EOS>
I
remove
the
habit
,
and
there
shine
forth
beneath
a
grand
plaid
silk
frock
,
white
trouser
,
and
burnished
shoe
;
and
,
while
her
eye
sparkle
joyfully
when
the
dog
come
bound
up
to
welcome
her
,
she
dare
hardly
touch
them
lest
they
should
fawn
upon
her
splendid
garment

<EOS>
She
kiss
me
gently

:
I
be
all
flour
make
the
Christmas
cake
,
and
it
would
not
have
do
to
give
me
a
hug
;
and
then
she
look
round
for
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
watch
anxiously
their
meeting
;
think
it
would
enable
them
to
judge
,
in
some
measure
,
what
ground
they
have
for
hope
to
succeed
in
separate
the
two
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
be
hard
to
discover
,
at
first
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
careless
,
and
uncared
for
,
before
Catherine
's
absence
,
he
have
be
ten
time
more
so
since
.
<EOS>
nobody
but
I
even
do
him
the
kindness
to
call
him
a
dirty
boy
,
and
bid
him
wash
himself
,
once
a
week
;
and
child
of
his
age
seldom
have
a
natural
pleasure
in
soap
and
water
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
not
to
mention
his
clothe
,
which
have
see
three
month
'
service
in
mire
and
dust
,
and
his
thick
uncombed
hair
,
the
surface
of
his
face
and
hand
be
dismally
becloud
.
<EOS>
He
may
well
skulk
behind
the
settle
,
on
behold
<EOS>
such
a
bright
,
graceful
damsel
enter
the
house
,
instead
of
a
rough
-
head
counterpart
of
himself
,
as
he
expect
.
<EOS>
"
be
Heathcliff
not
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
demand
,
pull
off
her
glove
,
and
display
finger
wonderfully
whiten
with
do
nothing
and
stay
indoor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
,
you
may
come
forward

"
cry
Mr.
Hindley
,
enjoy
his
discomfiture
,
and
gratify
to
see
what
a
forbid
young
blackguard
he
would
be
compel
to
present
himself
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
come
and
wish
Miss
Catherine
welcome

the
other

"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
,
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
friend
in
his
concealment
,
fly
to
embrace
him
;
she
bestow
seven
or
eight
kiss
on
his
cheek
within
the
second
,
and
then
stop
,
and
draw
back
,
burst
into
a
laugh
,
exclaim
,
"
why
,
how
very
black
and
cross
you
look
!
<EOS>
and
how
 
how
funny
and
grim
!

but
that
be
because
I
be
use
to
Edgar
and
Isabella
Linton
.
<EOS>
well
,
Heathcliff
,
have
you
forget
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
some
reason
to
put
the
question
,
for
shame
and
pride
throw
double
gloom
over
his
countenance
,
and
keep
him
immovable
.
  
<EOS>
"
shake
hand
,
Heathcliff
,
"
say
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
condescendingly
;
"
once
in
a
way
that
be
permit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not

"
reply
the
boy
,
find
his
tongue
at
last
;
"
I
shall
not
stand
to
be
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
bear
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
would
have
break
from
the
circle
,
but
Miss
Cathy
seize
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
laugh
at
you
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
could
not
hinder
myself
:
Heathcliff
,
shake
hand
at
least
!
<EOS>
what
be
you
sulky
for
?
<EOS>
It
be
only
that
you
look
odd
.
<EOS>
if
you
wash
your
face
and
brush
your
hair
,
it
will
be
all
right
:
but
you
be
so
dirty
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
gaze
concernedly
at
the
dusky
finger
she
hold
in
her
own
,
and
also
at
her
dress
;
which
she
fear
have
gain
no
embellishment
from
its
contact
with
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
have
touch
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
follow
her
eye
and
snatch
away
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
as
dirty
as
I
please
:
<EOS>
and
I
like
to
be
dirty
,
and
I
will
be
dirty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
he
dash
headforemost
out
of
the
room
,
amid
the
merriment
of
the
master
and
mistress
,
and
to
the
serious
disturbance
of
Catherine
;
who
could
not
comprehend
how
her
remark
should
have
produce
such
an
exhibition
of
bad
temper
.
  
<EOS>
after
play
lady'
-
maid
to
the
new
-
comer
,
and
put
my
cake
in
the
oven
,
and
make
the
house
and
kitchen
cheerful
with
great
fire
,
befit
Christmas
-
eve
,
I
prepare
to
sit
down
and
amuse
myself
by
singe
carol
,
all
alone
;
regardless
of
Joseph
's
affirmation
that
he
consider
the
merry
tune
I
choose
as
next
door
to
song
.
<EOS>
He
have
retire
to
private
prayer
in
his
chamber
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
be
engage
Missy
's
attention
by
sundry
gay
trifle
buy
for
her
to
present
to
the
little
Lintons
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
.
<EOS>
They
have
invite
them
to
spend
the
morrow
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
the
invitation
have
be
accept
,
on
one
condition
:
Mrs.
Linton
beg
that
her
darling
may
be
keep
carefully
apart
from
that
"
naughty
swearing
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
I
remain
solitary
.
<EOS>
I
smell
the
rich
scent
of
the
heating
spice
;
and
admire
the
shine
kitchen
utensil
,
the
polished
clock
,
deck
in
holly
,
the
silver
mug
range
on
a
tray
ready
to
be
fill
with
mulled
ale
for
supper
;
and
above
all
,
the
speckless
purity
of
my
particular
care
 
the
scoured
and
well
-
sweep
floor
.
<EOS>
I
give
due
inward
applause
to
every
object
,
and
then
I
remember
how
old
Earnshaw
use
to
come
in
when
all
be
tidy
,
and
call
me
a
can
not
lass
,
and
slip
a
shilling
into
my
hand
as
a
Christmas
-
box
;
and
from
that
I
go
on
to
think
of
his
fondness
for
Heathcliff
,
and
his
dread
lest
he
should
suffer
neglect
after
death
have
remove
him
:
and
that
naturally
lead
me
to
consider
the
poor
lad
's
situation
now
,
and
from
singe
I
change
my
mind
to
cry
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
soon
,
however
,
there
would
be
more
sense
in
endeavour
to
repair
some
of
his
wrong
than
shed
tear
over
them
:
I
get
up
and
walk
into
the
court
to
seek
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
far
;
I
find
him
smooth
the
glossy
coat
of
the
new
pony
in
the
stable
,
and
feed
the
other
beast
,
accord
to
custom
.
  
<EOS>
"
make
haste
,
Heathcliff

you

before
Miss
Cathy

together

with
the

to
yourself

a
long
chatter
till

He
proceed
with
his

never

his
head
towards
me

<EOS>
"
come
 
<EOS>
be

<EOS>
"
I
continue
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
little
cake
for
each
of
you

nearly
enough
;

you
will
need
half

an

hour
's
don

"
  
<EOS>
I
wait
five
minute
,
but
get
no
answer
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Catherine
sup
with
her
brother
and
sister
-
in
-
law
:
<EOS>
Joseph
and
I
join
at
an
unsociable
meal
,
season
with
reproofs
on
one
side
and
sauciness
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
His
cake
and
cheese
remain
on
the
table
all
night
for
the
fairy
.
<EOS>
He
manage
to
continue
work
till
nine
o'clock
,
and
then
march
dumb
and
dour
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Cathy
sit
up
late
,
have
a
world
of
thing
to
order
for
the
reception
of
her
new
friend
:
she
come
into
the
kitchen
once
to
speak
to
her
old
one
;
but
he
be
go
,
and
she
only
stay
to
ask
what
be
the
matter
with
him
,
and
then
go
back
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
he
rise
early
;
and
,
as
it
be
a
holiday
,
carry
his
ill
-
humour
on
to
the
moor
;
not
re
-
appear
till
the
family
be
depart
for
church
.
<EOS>
fasting
and
reflection
seem
to
have
bring
him
to
a
well
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
hang
about
me
for
a
while
,
and
have
screw
up
his
courage
,
exclaim
abruptly
 
"
nelly
,
make
me
decent
,
I
be
go
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
high
time
,
Heathcliff
,
"
I
say
;
"
you
_
have
<EOS>
_
grieve
<EOS>
Catherine
<EOS>
:
she
be
sorry
she
ever
come
home
,
I
daresay
!
<EOS>
It
look
as
if
you
envy
her
,
because
she
be
more
think
of
than
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
notion
of
_
envy
<EOS>
_
Catherine
be
incomprehensible
to
him
,
but
the
notion
of
grieve
her
he
understand
clearly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
say
she
be
grieve
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
,
look
very
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
cry
when
I
tell
her
you
be
off
again
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
_
I
_
cry
last
night
,
"
he
return
,
"
and
I
have
more
reason
to
cry
than
she
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
:
you
have
the
reason
of
go
to
bed
with
a
proud
heart
and
an
empty
stomach
,
"
say
I.
"
proud
people
breed
sad
sorrow
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
be
ashamed
of
your
touchiness
,
you
must
ask
pardon
,
mind
,
when
she
come
in
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
up
and
offer
to
kiss
her
,
and
say
 
you
know
good
what
to
say
;
only
do
it
heartily
,
and
not
as
if
you
think
her
convert
into
a
stranger
by
her
grand
dress
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
though
I
have
dinner
to
get
ready
,
I
will
steal
time
to
arrange
you
so
that
Edgar
Linton
shall
look
quite
a
doll
beside
you
:
and
that
he
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
young
,
and
yet
,
I
will
be
bind
,
you
be
tall
and
twice
as
broad
across
the
shoulder
;
you
could
knock
him
down
in
a
twinkling
;
do
not
you
feel
that
you
could
?
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
face
brighten
a
moment
;
then
it
be
overcast
afresh
,
and
he
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
nelly
,
if
I
knock
him
down
twenty
time
,
that
would
not
make
him
less
handsome
or
me
more
so
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
light
hair
and
a
fair
skin
,
and
be
dress
and
behave
as
well
,
and
have
a
chance
of
be
as
rich
as
he
will
be
!
"
  
"
and
cry
for
mamma
at
every
turn
,
"
I
add
,
"
and
tremble
if
a
country
lad
heave
his
fist
against
you
,
and
sit
at
home
all
day
for
a
shower
of
rain
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Heathcliff
,
you
be
show
a
poor
spirit
!
<EOS>
come
to
the
glass
,
and
I
will
let
you
see
what
you
should
wish
.
<EOS>
do
you
mark
those
two
line
between
your
eye
;
and
those
thick
brow
,
that
,
instead
of
rise
arch
,
sink
in
the
middle
;
and
that
couple
of
black
fiend
,
so
deeply
bury
,
who
never
open
their
window
boldly
,
but
lurk
glint
under
them
,
like
devil
's
spy
?
<EOS>
wish
and
learn
to
smooth
away
the
surly
wrinkle
,
to
raise
your
lid
frankly
,
and
change
the
fiend
to
confident
,
innocent
angel
,
suspect
and
doubt
nothing
,
and
always
see
friend
where
they
be
not
sure
of
foe
.
<EOS>
do
not
get
the
expression
of
a
vicious
cur
that
appear
to
know
the
kick
it
get
be
its
desert
,
and
yet
hate
all
the
world
,
as
well
as
the
kicker
,
for
what
it
suffer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
other
word
,
I
must
wish
for
Edgar
Linton
's
great
blue
eye
and
even
forehead
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
 
and
that
will
not
help
me
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
good
heart
will
help
you
to
a
bonny
face
,
my
lad
,
"
<EOS>
I
continue
,
"
if
you
be
a
regular
black
;
and
a
bad
one
will
turn
the
bonny
into
something
bad
than
ugly
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
we
have
do
washing
,
and
comb
,
and
sulk
 
tell
me
whether
you
do
not
think
yourself
rather
handsome
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
fit
for
a
prince
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
who
know
but
your
father
be
Emperor
of
China
,
and
your
mother
an
indian
queen
,
each
of
them
able
to
buy
up
,
with
one
week
's
income
,
Wuthering
Heights
and
Thrushcross
Grange
together
?
<EOS>
and
you
be
kidnap
by
wicked
sailor
and
bring
to
England
.
<EOS>
be
I
in
your
place
,
I
would
frame
high
notion
of
my
birth
;
and
the
thought
of
what
I
be
should
give
me
courage
and
dignity
to
support
the
oppression
of
a
little
farmer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
chatter
on
;
and
Heathcliff
gradually
lose
his
frown
and
begin
to
look
quite
pleasant
,
when
all
at
once
our
conversation
be
interrupt
by
a
rumble
sound
move
up
the
road
and
enter
the
court
.
<EOS>
He
run
to
the
window
and
I
to
the
door
,
just
in
time
to
behold
the
two
Lintons
descend
from
the
family
carriage
,
smother
in
cloak
and
fur
,
and
the
Earnshaws
dismount
from
their
horse
:
they
often
ride
to
church
in
winter
.
<EOS>
Catherine
take
a
hand
of
each
of
the
child
,
and
bring
them
into
the
house
and
set
them
before
the
fire
,
which
quickly
put
colour
into
their
white
face
.
  
<EOS>
I
urge
my
companion
to
hasten
now
and
show
his
amiable
humour
,
and
he
willingly
obey
;
but
ill
luck
would
have
it
that
,
as
he
open
the
door
lead
from
the
kitchen
on
one
side
,
Hindley
open
it
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
meet
,
and
the
master
,
irritate
at
see
him
clean
and
cheerful
,
or
,
perhaps
,
eager
to
keep
his
promise
to
Mrs.
Linton
,
shove
him
back
with
a
sudden
thrust
,
and
angrily
bade
Joseph
"
keep
the
fellow
out
of
the
room
 
send
him
into
the
garret
till
dinner
be
over
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
cram
his
finger
in
the
tart
and
steal
the
fruit
,
if
leave
alone
with
them
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
I
could
not
avoid
answer
,
"
he
will
touch
nothing
,
not
he
:
and
I
suppose
he
must
have
his
share
of
the
dainty
as
well
as
we
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
his
share
of
my
hand
,
if
I
catch
him
downstairs
till
dark
,
"
cry
Hindley
.
<EOS>
"
Begone
,
you
vagabond
!
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
be
attempt
the
coxcomb
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
wait
till
I
get
hold
of
those
elegant
lock
 
<EOS>
see
if
I
will
not
pull
them
a
bit
longer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
long
enough
already
,
"
observe
Master
Linton
,
peep
from
the
doorway
;
"
I
wonder
they
do
not
make
his
head
ache
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
colt
's
mane
over
his
eye
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
venture
this
remark
without
any
intention
to
insult
;
but
Heathcliff
's
violent
nature
be
not
prepared
to
endure
the
appearance
of
impertinence
from
one
whom
he
seem
to
hate
,
even
then
,
as
a
rival
.
<EOS>
He
seize
a
tureen
of
hot
apple
sauce
(
the
first
thing
that
come
under
his
gripe
)
and
dash
it
full
against
the
speaker
's
face
and
neck
;
who
instantly
commence
a
lament
that
bring
Isabella
and
Catherine
hurrying
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
snatch
up
the
culprit
directly
and
convey
him
to
his
chamber
;
where
,
doubtless
,
he
administer
a
rough
remedy
to
cool
the
fit
of
passion
,
for
he
appear
red
and
breathless
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
dishcloth
,
and
rather
spitefully
scrub
Edgar
's
nose
and
mouth
,
affirm
it
serve
him
right
for
meddling
.
<EOS>
His
sister
begin
weep
to
go
home
,
and
Cathy
stand
by
confound
,
blush
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
speak
to
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
expostulate
with
Master
Linton
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
bad
temper
,
and
now
you
have
spoil
your
visit
;
and
he
will
be
flog
<EOS>
:
I
hate
him
to
be
flog
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
eat
my
dinner
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
speak
to
him
,
Edgar
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
sob
the
youth
,
escape
from
my
hand
,
and
finish
the
remainder
of
the
purification
with
his
cambric
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
I
promise
mamma
that
I
would
not
say
one
word
to
him
,
and
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
do
not
cry
,
"
reply
Catherine
,
contemptuously
;
"
you
be
not
kill
.
<EOS>
do
not
make
more
mischief
;
my
brother
be
come
:
be
quiet
!
<EOS>
Hush
,
Isabella
!
<EOS>
have
anybody
hurt
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
there
,
child
 
to
your
seat
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Hindley
,
bustle
in
.
<EOS>
"
that
brute
of
a
lad
have
warm
me
nicely
.
<EOS>
next
time
,
Master
Edgar
,
take
the
law
into
your
own
fist
 
it
will
give
you
an
appetite
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
little
party
recover
its
equanimity
at
sight
of
the
fragrant
feast
.
<EOS>
They
be
hungry
after
their
ride
,
and
easily
console
,
since
no
real
harm
have
befall
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
carve
bountiful
plateful
,
and
the
mistress
make
them
merry
with
lively
talk
.
<EOS>
I
wait
behind
her
chair
,
and
be
pain
to
behold
Catherine
,
with
dry
eye
and
an
indifferent
air
,
commence
cut
up
the
wing
of
a
goose
before
her
.
"
<EOS>
an
unfeele
child
,
"
I
think
to
myself
;
"
how
lightly
she
dismiss
her
old
playmate
's
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
imagine
her
to
be
so
selfish
.
"
<EOS>
She
lift
a
mouthful
to
her
lip
:
then
she
set
it
down
again
:
her
cheek
flush
,
and
the
tear
gush
over
them
.
<EOS>
She
slip
her
fork
to
the
floor
,
and
hastily
dive
under
the
cloth
to
conceal
her
emotion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
her
unfeele
long
;
for
I
perceive
she
be
in
purgatory
throughout
the
day
,
and
weary
to
find
an
opportunity
of
get
by
herself
,
or
pay
a
visit
to
Heathcliff
,
who
have
be
lock
up
by
the
master
:
as
I
discover
,
on
endeavour
to
introduce
to
him
a
private
mess
of
victual
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
we
have
a
dance
.
<EOS>
Cathy
beg
that
he
may
be
liberate
then
,
as
Isabella
Linton
have
no
partner
:
her
entreaty
be
vain
,
and
I
be
appoint
to
supply
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
We
get
rid
of
all
gloom
in
the
excitement
of
the
exercise
,
and
our
pleasure
be
increase
by
the
arrival
of
the
Gimmerton
band
,
muster
fifteen
strong
:
<EOS>
a
trumpet
,
a
trombone
,
clarionet
,
bassoon
,
french
horn
,
and
a
bass
viol
,
besides
singer
.
<EOS>
They
go
the
round
of
all
the
respectable
house
,
and
receive
contribution
every
Christmas
,
and
we
esteem
it
a
first
-
rate
treat
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
after
the
usual
carol
have
be
sing
,
we
set
them
to
song
and
glee
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Earnshaw
love
the
music
,
and
so
they
give
us
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
love
it
too
:
but
she
say
it
sound
sweetest
at
the
top
of
the
step
,
and
she
go
up
in
the
dark
:
<EOS>
I
follow
.
<EOS>
They
shut
the
house
door
below
,
never
note
our
absence
,
it
be
so
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
stay
at
the
stairs'-head
,
but
mount
farther
,
to
the
garret
where
Heathcliff
be
confine
,
and
call
him
.
<EOS>
He
stubbornly
decline
answer
for
a
while
:
she
persevere
,
and
finally
persuade
him
to
hold
communion
with
her
through
the
board
.
<EOS>
I
let
the
poor
thing
converse
unmoleste
,
till
I
suppose
the
song
be
go
to
cease
,
and
the
singer
to
get
some
refreshment
:
then
I
clamber
up
the
ladder
to
warn
her
.
<EOS>
instead
of
find
her
outside
,
I
hear
her
voice
within
.
<EOS>
the
little
monkey
have
creep
by
the
skylight
of
one
garret
,
along
the
roof
,
into
the
skylight
of
the
other
,
and
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
I
could
coax
her
out
again
.
<EOS>
when
she
do
come
,
Heathcliff
come
with
her
,
and
she
insist
that
I
should
take
him
into
the
kitchen
,
as
my
fellow
-
servant
have
go
to
a
neighbour
's
,
to
be
remove
from
the
sound
of
our
"
devil
's
psalmody
,
"
as
it
please
him
to
call
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
I
intend
by
no
means
to
encourage
their
trick
:
but
as
the
prisoner
have
never
break
his
fast
since
yesterday
's
dinner
,
I
would
wink
at
his
cheat
Mr.
Hindley
that
once
.
<EOS>
He
go
down
:
I
set
him
a
stool
by
the
fire
,
and
offer
him
a
quantity
of
good
thing
:
but
he
be
sick
and
could
eat
little
,
and
my
attempt
to
entertain
him
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
He
lean
his
two
elbow
on
his
knee
,
and
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
remain
rapt
in
dumb
meditation
.
<EOS>
on
my
inquire
the
subject
of
his
thought
,
he
answer
gravely
 
"
I
be
try
to
settle
how
I
shall
pay
Hindley
back
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
how
long
I
wait
,
if
I
can
only
do
it
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
die
before
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
shame
,
Heathcliff
!
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
God
to
punish
wicked
people
;
we
should
learn
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
God
will
not
have
the
satisfaction
that
I
shall
,
"
he
return
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
I
know
the
good
way
!
<EOS>
let
me
alone
,
and
I
will
plan
it
out
:
while
I
be
think
of
that
I
do
not
feel
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
forget
these
tale
can
not
divert
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
annoy
how
I
should
dream
of
chatter
on
at
such
a
rate
;
and
your
gruel
cold
,
and
you
nod
for
bed
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
tell
Heathcliff
's
history
,
all
that
you
need
hear
,
in
half
a
dozen
word
.
"
     
<EOS>
thus
interrupt
herself
,
the
housekeeper
rise
,
and
proceed
to
lay
aside
her
sewing
;
but
I
feel
incapable
of
move
from
the
hearth
,
and
I
be
very
far
from
nod
.
"
<EOS>
sit
still
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
"
I
cry
;
"
do
sit
still
another
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
You
have
do
just
right
to
tell
the
story
leisurely
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
method
I
like
;
and
you
must
finish
it
in
the
same
style
.
<EOS>
I
be
interested
in
every
character
you
have
mention
,
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
clock
be
on
the
stroke
of
eleven
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
matter
 
I
be
not
accustomed
to
go
to
bed
in
the
long
hour
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
be
early
enough
for
a
person
who
lie
till
ten

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
lie
till
ten
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
very
prime
of
the
morning
go
long
before
that
time
.
<EOS>
a
person
who
have
not
do
one
-
half
his
day
's
work
by
ten
o'clock
,
run
a
chance
of
leave
the
other
half
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
resume
your
chair
;
because
to
-
morrow
I
intend
lengthen
the
night
till
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
prognosticate
for
myself
an
obstinate
cold
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
well
,
you
must
allow
me
to
leap
over
some
three
year
;
during
that
space
Mrs.
Earnshaw
 
"
  
"
no
,
no
,
I
will
allow
nothing
of
the
sort
!
<EOS>
be
you
acquaint
with
the
mood
of
mind
in
which
,
if
you
be
seat
alone
,
and
the
cat
lick
its
kitten
on
the
rug
before
you
,
you
would
watch
the
operation
so
intently
that
puss
's
neglect
of
one
ear
would
put
you
seriously
out
of
temper
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
terribly
lazy
mood
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
a
tiresomely
active
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
mine
,
at
present
;
and
,
therefore
,
continue
minutely
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
people
in
these
region
acquire
over
people
in
town
the
value
that
a
spider
in
a
dungeon
do
over
a
spider
in
a
cottage
,
to
their
various
occupant
;
and
yet
the
deepened
attraction
be
not
entirely
owing
to
the
situation
of
the
looker
-
on
.
<EOS>
They
_
do
_
live
more
in
earnest
,
<EOS>
more
in
themselves
,
and
less
in
surface
,
change
,
and
frivolous
external
thing
.
<EOS>
I
could
fancy
a
love
for
life
here
almost
possible
;
and
I
be
a
fix
unbeliever
in
any
love
of
a
year
's
standing
.
<EOS>
one
state
resemble
set
a
hungry
man
down
to
a
single
dish
,
on
which
he
may
concentrate
his
entire
appetite
and
do
it
justice
;
the
other
,
introduce
him
to
a
table
lay
out
by
french
cook
<EOS>
:
he
can
perhaps
extract
as
much
enjoyment
from
the
whole
;
but
each
part
be
a
mere
atom
in
his
regard
and
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
here
we
be
the
same
as
anywhere
else
,
when
you
get
to
know
us
,
"
observe
Mrs.
Dean
,
somewhat
puzzle
at
my
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
"
I
respond
;
"
you
,
my
good
friend
,
be
a
striking
evidence
against
that
assertion
.
<EOS>
except
a
few
provincialism
of
slight
consequence
,
you
have
no
mark
of
the
manner
which
I
be
habituate
to
consider
as
peculiar
to
your
class
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
have
think
a
great
deal
more
than
<EOS>
the
generality
of
servant
think
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
compel
to
cultivate
your
reflective
faculty
for
want
of
occasion
for
fritter
your
life
away
in
silly
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
esteem
myself
a
steady
,
reasonable
kind
of
body
,
"
she
say
;
"
not
exactly
from
live
among
the
hill
and
see
one
set
of
face
,
and
one
series
of
action
,
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
;
but
I
have
undergo
sharp
discipline
,
which
have
teach
me
wisdom
;
and
then
,
I
have
read
more
than
you
would
fancy
,
Mr.
Lockwood
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
open
a
book
in
this
library
that
I
have
not
look
into
,
and
get
something
out
of
also
:
unless
it
be
that
range
of
Greek
and
Latin
,
and
that
of
French
;
and
those
I
know
one
from
another
:
it
be
as
much
as
you
can
expect
of
a
poor
man
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
I
be
to
follow
my
story
in
true
gossip
's
fashion
,
I
have
better
go
on
;
and
instead
of
leap
three
year
,
I
will
be
content
to
pass
to
the
next
summer
 
the
summer
of
1778
,
that
be
nearly
twenty
-
three
year
ago
.
"
    
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
a
fine
June
day
my
first
bonny
little
nursling
,
and
the
last
of
the
ancient
Earnshaw
stock
,
be
bear
.
<EOS>
We
be
busy
with
the
hay
in
a
far
-
away
field
,
when
the
girl
that
usually
bring
our
breakfast
come
run
an
hour
too
soon
across
the
meadow
and
up
the
lane
,
call
me
as
she
run
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
such
a
grand
bairn
!
<EOS>
"
she
pant
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fine
lad
that
ever
breathe
!
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
say
missis
must
go
:
he
say
she
be
be
in
a
consumption
these
many
month
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
tell
Mr.
Hindley
:
and
now
she
have
nothing
to
keep
her
,
and
she
will
be
dead
before
winter
.
<EOS>
You
must
come
home
directly
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
nurse
it
,
nelly
:
to
feed
it
with
sugar
and
milk
,
and
take
care
of
it
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
you
,
because
it
will
be
all
your
when
there
be
no
missis
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
she
very
ill
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
,
fling
down
my
rake
and
tie
my
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
guess
she
be
;
yet
she
look
bravely
,
"
reply
the
girl
,
"
and
she
talk
as
if
she
think
of
live
to
see
it
grow
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
be
out
of
her
head
for
joy
,
it
be
such
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
if
I
be
her
<EOS>
I
be
certain
<EOS>
I
should
not
die
<EOS>
:
I
should
get
well
at
the
bare
sight
of
it
,
in
spite
of
Kenneth
.
<EOS>
I
be
fairly
mad
at
him
.
<EOS>
Dame
Archer
bring
the
cherub
down
to
master
,
in
the
house
,
and
his
face
just
begin
to
light
up
,
when
the
old
croaker
step
forward
,
and
say
he
 
<EOS>
"
Earnshaw
,
it
be
a
blessing
your
wife
have
be
spare
to
leave
you
this
son
.
<EOS>
when
she
come
,
I
feel
convinced
we
should
not
keep
her
long
;
and
now
,
I
must
tell
you
,
the
winter
will
probably
finish
her
.
<EOS>
do
not
take
on
,
and
fret
about
it
too
much
:
it
can
not
be
help
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
you
should
have
know
better
than
to
choose
such
a
rush
of
a
lass
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
do
the
master
answer
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
swear
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mind
him
,
I
be
strain
to
see
the
bairn
,
"
and
she
begin
again
to
describe
it
rapturously
.
<EOS>
I
,
as
zealous
as
herself
,
hurry
eagerly
home
to
admire
,
on
my
part
;
though
I
be
very
sad
for
Hindley
's
sake
.
<EOS>
He
have
room
in
his
heart
only
for
two
idol
 
his
wife
and
himself
:
he
dote
on
both
,
and
adore
one
,
and
I
could
not
conceive
how
he
would
bear
the
loss
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
there
he
stand
at
the
front
door
;
and
,
as
I
pass
in
,
I
ask
,
"
how
be
the
baby
?
"
  
"
nearly
ready
to
run
about
,
Nell
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
,
put
on
a
cheerful
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
inquire
;
"
the
doctor
say
she
be

"
damn
the
doctor
!
"
<EOS>
he
interrupt
,
redden
.
<EOS>
"
Frances
be
quite
right
:
she
will
be
perfectly
well
by
this
time
next
week

<EOS>
be
you
go
up

stair
?
<EOS>
will
you
tell
her
that
I
will
come
,
if
she
will
promise
not
to
talk
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
because
she
would
not
hold
her
tongue
;
and
she
must
 
tell
her
Mr.
Kenneth
say
she
must
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
deliver
this
message
to
Mrs.
Earnshaw
;
she
seem
in
flighty
spirit
,
and
reply
merrily
,
"
I
hardly
speak
a
word
,
Ellen
,
and
there
he
have
go
out
twice
,
cry
.
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
promise
I
will
not
speak
:
but
that
do
not
bind
me
not
to
laugh
at
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
till
within
a
week
of
her
death
that
gay
heart
never
fail
her
;
and
her
husband
persist
doggedly
,
nay
,
furiously
,
in
affirm
her
health
improve
every
day

<EOS>
when
Kenneth
warn
him
that
his
medicine
be
useless
at
that
stage
of
the
malady
,
and
he
nee
not
put
him
to
further
expense

he
retort

"
I
know
you

not
 
<EOS>
she

well

she

any
more
attendance
from
you

<EOS>
She
never
be
in
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fever
;
and
it
be
go
:
her
pulse
be
as
slow
as
mine
now
,
and
her
cheek
as
cool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tell
his
wife
the
same
story
,
and
she
seem
to
believe
him
;
but
one
night
,
while
lean
on
his
shoulder
,
in
the
act
of
say
she
think
she
should
be
able
to
get
up
to
-
morrow
,
a
fit
of
coughing
<EOS>
take
her
 
a
very
slight
one
 
<EOS>
he
raise
her
in
his
arm
;
she
put
her
two
hand
about
his
neck
,
her
face
change
,
and
she
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
girl
have
anticipate
,
the
child
Hareton
fall
wholly
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
provide
he
see
him
healthy
and
never
hear
him
cry
,
be
content
,
as
far
as
regard
him
.
<EOS>
for
himself
,
he
grow
desperate
:
<EOS>
his
sorrow
be
of
that
kind
that
will
not
lament
.
<EOS>
He
neither
weep
nor
pray
;
he
curse
and
defy
:
execrated
God
and
man
,
and
give
himself
up
to
reckless
dissipation
.
<EOS>
the
servant
could
not
bear
his
tyrannical
and
evil
conduct
long
:
<EOS>
Joseph
and
I
be
the
only
two
that
would
stay
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
heart
to
leave
my
charge
;
and
besides
,
you
know
,
I
have
be
his
foster
-
sister
,
and
excuse
his
behaviour
more
readily
than
a
stranger
would
.
<EOS>
Joseph
remain
to
hector
over
tenant
and
labourer
;
and
because
it
be
his
vocation
to
be
where
he
have
plenty
of
wickedness
to
reprove
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
's
bad
way
and
bad
companion
form
a
pretty
example
for
Catherine
and
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
His
treatment
of
the
latter
be
enough
to
make
a
fiend
of
a
saint
.
<EOS>
and
,
truly
,
it
appear
as
if
the
lad
_
be
_
possess
of
something
diabolical
at
that
period
.
<EOS>
He
delight
to
witness
Hindley
degrade
himself
past
redemption
;
and
become
daily
more
notable
for
savage
sullenness
and
ferocity
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
half
tell
what
an
infernal
house
we
have
.
<EOS>
the
curate
drop
call
,
and
nobody
decent
come
near
us
,
at
last
;
unless
Edgar
Linton
's
visit
to
Miss
Cathy
may
be
an
exception
.
<EOS>
at
fifteen
she
be
the
queen
of
the
country
-
side
;
she
have
no
peer
;
and
she
do
turn
out
a
haughty
,
headstrong
creature
!
<EOS>
I
own
I
do
not
like
her
,
after
infancy
be
past
;
and
I
vex
her
frequently
by
try
to
bring
down
her
arrogance
:
she
never
take
an
aversion
to
me
,
though
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
wondrous
constancy
to
old
attachment
:
even
Heathcliff
keep
his
hold
on
her
affection
unalterably
;
and
young
Linton
,
with
all
his
superiority
,
find
it
difficult
to
make
an
equally
deep
impression
.
<EOS>
He
be
my
late
master
:
<EOS>
that
be
his
portrait
over
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
It
use
to
hang
on
one
side
,
and
his
wife
be
on
the
other
;
but
her
have
be
remove
,
or
else
you
may
see
something
of
what
she
be
.
<EOS>
Can
you
make
that
out
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
raise
the
candle
,
and
I
discern
a
soft
-
featured
face
,
exceedingly
resemble
the
young
lady
at
the
Heights
,
but
more
pensive
and
amiable
in
expression
.
<EOS>
It
form
a
sweet
picture
.
<EOS>
the
long
light
hair
curl
slightly
on
the
temple
;
the
eye
be
large
and
serious
;
the
figure
almost
too
graceful
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
marvel
how
Catherine
Earnshaw
could
forget
her
first
friend
for
such
an
individual
.
<EOS>
I
marvel
much
how
he
,
with
a
mind
to
correspond
with
his
person
,
could
fancy
my
idea
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
agreeable
portrait
,
"
I
observe
to
the
house
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
answer
;
"
but
he
look
better
when
he
be
animate
;
that
be
his
everyday
countenance
:
he
want
spirit
in
general
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
have
keep
up
her
acquaintance
with
the
Lintons
since
her
five
-
week
'
residence
among
them
;
and
as
she
have
no
temptation
to
show
her
rough
side
in
their
company
,
and
have
the
sense
to
be
ashamed
of
be
rude
where
she
experience
such
invariable
courtesy
,
she
impose
unwittingly
on
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
by
her
ingenious
cordiality
;
gain
the
admiration
of
Isabella
,
and
the
heart
and
soul
of
her
brother
:
acquisition
that
flatter
her
from
the
first
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
full
of
ambition
 
and
lead
her
to
adopt
a
double
character
without
exactly
intend
to
deceive
any
one
.
<EOS>
in
the
place
where
she
hear
Heathcliff
term
a
"
vulgar
young
ruffian
,
"
and
"
bad
than
a
brute
,
"
she
take
care
not
to
act
like
him
;
but
at
home
she
have
small
inclination
to
practise
politeness
that
would
only
be
laugh
at
,
and
restrain
an
unruly
nature
when
it
would
bring
her
neither
credit
nor
praise
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Edgar
seldom
muster
courage
to
visit
Wuthering
Heights
openly
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
terror
of
Earnshaw
's
reputation
,
and
shrink
from
encounter
him
;
and
yet
he
be
always
receive
with
our
good
attempt
at
civility
:
the
master
himself
avoid
offend
him
,
know
why
he
come
;
and
if
he
could
not
be
gracious
,
keep
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
his
appearance
there
be
distasteful
to
Catherine
;
she
be
not
artful
,
never
play
the
coquette
,
and
have
evidently
an
objection
to
her
two
friend
meet
at
all
;
for
when
Heathcliff
express
contempt
of
Linton
in
his
presence
,
she
could
not
half
coincide
,
as
she
do
in
his
absence
;
and
when
Linton
evince
disgust
and
antipathy
to
Heathcliff
,
she
dare
not
treat
his
sentiment
with
indifference
,
as
if
depreciation
of
her
playmate
be
of
scarcely
any
consequence
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
many
a
laugh
at
her
perplexity
and
untold
trouble
,
which
she
vainly
strove
to
hide
from
my
mockery
.
<EOS>
that
sound
ill
-
natured
:
but
she
be
so
proud
it
become
really
impossible
to
pity
her
distress
,
till
she
should
be
chasten
into
more
humility
.
<EOS>
She
do
bring
herself
,
finally
,
to
confess
,
and
to
confide
in
me
:
there
be
not
a
soul
else
that
she
may
fashion
into
an
adviser
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
have
go
from
home
one
afternoon
,
and
Heathcliff
presume
to
give
himself
a
holiday
on
the
strength
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
reach
the
age
of
sixteen
then
,
I
think
,
and
without
have
bad
feature
,
or
be
deficient
in
intellect
,
he
contrive
to
convey
an
impression
of
inward
and
outward
repulsiveness
that
his
present
aspect
retain
no
trace
of
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
have
by
that
time
lose
the
benefit
of
his
early
education
:
continual
hard
work
,
begin
soon
and
conclude
late
,
have
extinguish
any
curiosity
he
once
possess
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
,
and
any
love
for
book
or
learning
.
<EOS>
His
childhood
's
sense
of
superiority
,
instill
into
him
by
the
favour
of
old
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
be
fade
away
.
<EOS>
He
struggle
long
to
keep
up
an
equality
with
Catherine
in
her
study
,
and
yield
with
poignant
though
silent
regret
:
but
he
yield
completely
;
and
there
be
no
prevail
on
him
to
take
a
step
in
the
way
of
move
upward
,
when
he
find
he
must
,
necessarily
,
sink
beneath
his
former
level
.
<EOS>
then
personal
appearance
sympathise
with
mental
deterioration
:
he
acquire
a
slouch
gait
and
ignoble
look
;
his
naturally
reserve
disposition
be
exaggerate
into
an
almost
idiotic
excess
of
unsociable
moroseness
;
and
he
take
a
grim
pleasure
,
apparently
,
in
excite
the
aversion
rather
than
the
esteem
of
his
few
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
and
he
be
constant
companion
still
at
his
season
of
respite
from
labour
;
but
he
have
cease
to
express
his
fondness
for
her
in
word
,
and
recoil
with
angry
suspicion
from
her
girlish
caress
,
as
if
conscious
there
could
be
no
gratification
in
lavish
such
mark
of
affection
on
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
before
-
name
occasion
he
come
into
the
house
to
announce
his
intention
of
do
nothing
,
while
I
be
assist
Miss
Cathy
to
arrange
her
dress
:
she
have
not
reckon
on
his
take
it
into
his
head
to
be
idle
;
and
imagine
she
would
have
the
whole
place
to
herself
,
she
manage
,
by
some
mean
,
to
inform
Mr.
Edgar
of
her
brother
's
absence
,
and
be
then
prepare
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cathy
,
be
you
busy
this
afternoon
?
"
ask
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
anywhere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
rain
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
have
you
that
silk
frock
on
,
then
?
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
come
here
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
know
of
,
"
stammer
Miss
:
"
but
you
should
be
in
the
field
now
,
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
hour
past
dinnertime
:
I
think
you
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hindley
do
not
often
free
us
from
his
accurse
presence
,
"
observe
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
work
any
more
to

day
:
I
will
stay
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
Joseph
will
tell
,
"
she
suggest
;
"
you
would
better
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
be
load
lime
on
the
further
side
of
Penistone
Crags
;
it
will
take
him
till
dark
,
and
he
will
never
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
say
,
he
lounge
to
the
fire
,
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Catherine
reflect
an
instant
,
with
knit
brow
 
<EOS>
she
find
it
needful
to
smooth
the
way
for
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
"
Isabella
and
Edgar
Linton
talk
of
call
this
afternoon
,
"
she
say
,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
minute
's
silence
.
"
<EOS>
as
it
rain
,
I
hardly
expect
them
;
but
they
may
come
,
and
if
they
do
,
you
run
the
risk
of
be
scold
for
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Order
Ellen
to
say
you
be
engage

Cathy

"
he
persist
;
"
do
not
turn
me
out
for
those
pitiful

silly

yours

<EOS>
I
be
on

<EOS>
cry
Catherine
,
gaze
at
him
with
a
troubled
countenance

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
she
add
petulantly
,
jerk
her
head
away
from

,
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing

continue

Catherine

in

peevish
tone

<EOS>
and
where
be
the
sense

that

"
to
show
that

Heathcliff

should
I

she

grow
more
irritated

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
good
do
I
get
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
talk

<EOS>
You
may
be
dumb

<EOS>
"
You
never
tell
me
before
that
I
talk
too
little

or
that
you
dislike
my
company

Cathy

"
<EOS>
exclaim
Heathcliff
,
in
much
agitation

<EOS>
"
It
be
no
company
at
all
,
when
people
know
nothing

say
nothing

she
mutter

<EOS>
Her
companion
rise
up
,
but
he
have
not
time
to
express
his
feeling
further
,
for
a
horse
's
foot
be
hear
on

and
have
knock
gently
,
young
Linton
enter
,
his
face
brilliant
with
delight
at
the
unexpected
summon
she
have
receive
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
Catherine
mark
the
difference
between
her
friend
,
as
one
come
in
and
the
other
go
out
.
<EOS>
the
contrast
resemble
what
you
see
in
exchange
a
bleak
,
hilly
,
coal
country
for
a
beautiful
fertile
valley
;
and
his
voice
and
greeting
be
as
opposite
as
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
sweet
,
low
manner
of
speak
,
and
pronounce
his
word
as
you
do
:
that
be
less
gruff
than
we
talk
here
,
and
soft
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
come
too
soon
,
be
I

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
cast
a
look
at
me
:
I
have
begin
to
wipe
the
plate
,
and
tidy
some
drawer
at
the
far
end
in
the
dresser

<EOS>
"
no

answer
Catherine

<EOS>
"
what

"
  
<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
(
Mr.

She

behind

crossly

the

imperiously

not
allow
her
guest
time

fail

recover
her
equanimity

little
dispute
with
Heathcliff

I

I

assiduously

She

suppose
Edgar

snatch
the
cloth
from

pinch
me

with
a

very
spitefully

I
have
say
I
do

rather
relish
mortify
her
vanity

then
:
besides

she
hurt
me
extremely

so
I
start
up

out

rage

She

her

"
what

I
retort

show
a

purple

refute
her

<EOS>
She
stamp
her
foot

waver
a
moment

and
then
,
irresistibly
impel
by
the
naughty
spirit

Linton

greatly
shock
at
the
double
fault

falsehood

violence

his

off

not
yet
,
Edgar
Linton
:
sit
down
;
you
shall
not
leave
me
in
that
temper
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
miserable
all
night
,
and
I
will
not
be
miserable
for
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
stay
after
you
have
strike
me
?
"
ask
Linton
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
be
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
make
me
afraid
and
ashamed
of
you
,
"
he
continue
;
"
I
will
not
come
here
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eye
begin
to
glisten
and
her
lid
to
twinkle
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
tell
a
deliberate
untruth
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
recover
her
speech
;
"
I
do
nothing
deliberately
.
<EOS>
well
,
go
,
if
you
please
 
get
away
!
<EOS>
and
now
I
will
cry
 
<EOS>
I
will
cry
myself
sick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
drop
down
on
her
knee
by
a
chair
,
and
set
to
weep
in
serious
earnest
.
<EOS>
Edgar
persevere
in
his
resolution
as
far
as
the
court
;
there
he
linger
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
encourage
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
be
dreadfully
wayward
,
sir
,
"
I
call
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
bad
as
any
marred
child
:
you
would
better
be
ride
home
,
or
else
she
will
be
sick
,
only
to
grieve
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
soft
thing
look
askance
through
the
window
:
he
possess
the
power
to
depart
as
much
as
a
cat
possess
the
power
to
leave
a
mouse
half
kill
,
or
a
bird
half
eat
.
<EOS>
ah
,
I
think
,
there
will
be
no
save
him
:
he
be
doom
,
and
fly
to
his
fate
!
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
:
he
turn
abruptly
,
hasten
into
the
house
again
,
shut
the
door
behind
him
;
and
when
I
go
in
a
while
after
to
inform
them
that
Earnshaw
have
come
home
rabid
drunk
,
ready
to
pull
the
whole
place
about
our
ear
(
his
ordinary
frame
of
mind
in
that
condition
)
,
I
see
the
quarrel
have
merely
effect
a
close
intimacy
 
have
break
the
outwork
of
youthful
timidity
,
and
enable
them
to
forsake
the
disguise
of
friendship
,
and
confess
themselves
lover
.
  
<EOS>
intelligence
of
Mr.
Hindley
's
arrival
drive
Linton
speedily
to
his
horse
,
and
Catherine
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
hide
little
Hareton
,
and
to
take
the
shot
out
of
the
master
's
fowling
-
piece
,
which
he
be
fond
of
play
with
in
his
insane
excitement
,
to
the
hazard
of
the
life
of
any
who
provoke
,
or
even
attract
his
notice
too
much
;
and
I
have
hit
upon
the
plan
of
remove
it
,
that
he
may
do
less
mischief
if
he
do
go
the
length
of
fire
the
gun
.
    
<EOS>
He
enter
,
vociferate
oath
dreadful
to
hear
;
and
catch
me
in
the
act
of
stow
his
son
away
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
.
<EOS>
Hareton
be
impress
with
a
wholesome
terror
of
encounter
either
his
wild
beast
's
fondness
or
his
madman
's
rage
;
for
in
one
he
run
a
chance
of
be
squeeze
and
kiss
to
death
,
and
in
the
other
of
be
fling
into
the
fire
,
or
dash
against
the
wall
;
and
the
poor
thing
remain
perfectly
quiet
wherever
I
choose
to
put
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
I
have
find
it
out
at
last
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Hindley
,
pull
me
back
by
the
skin
of
my
neck
,
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
heaven
and
hell
,
you
have
swear
between
you
to
murder
that
child
!
<EOS>
I
know
how
it
be
,
now
,
that
he
be
always
out
of
my
way
.
<EOS>
but
,
with
the
help
of
Satan
,
I
shall
make
you
swallow
the
carving
-
knife
,
nelly
!
<EOS>
You
need
not
laugh
;
for
I
have
just
cram
Kenneth
,
head
-
downmost
,
in
the
Black
-
horse
marsh
;
and
two
be
the
same
as
one
 
<EOS>
and
I
want
to
kill
some
of
you
<EOS>
:
I
shall
have
no
rest
till
I
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
like
the
carving
-
knife
,
Mr.
Hindley
,
"
I
answer
;
"
it
have
be
cut
red
herring
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
be
shoot
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
rather
be
damned
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
and
so
you
shall

<EOS>
no
law
in
England
can
hinder
a
man
from
keep
his
house
decent

mine
's
abominable
!
<EOS>
open
your
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
He
hold
the
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
push
its
point
between
my
tooth
:
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
be
never
much
afraid
of
his
vagary
.
<EOS>
I
spit
out
,
and
affirm
it
taste
detestably
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
take
it
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
he
,
release
me
,
"
I
see
that
hideous
little
villain
be
not
Hareton
:
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Nell
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
,
he
deserve
flay
alive
for
not
run
to
welcome
me
,
and
for
scream
as
if
I
be
a
goblin
.
<EOS>
Unnatural
cub
,
come
hither
!
<EOS>
I
will
teach
thee
to
impose
on
a
good

hearted
,
delude
father
.
<EOS>
now
,
do
not
you
think
the
lad
would
be
handsome
crop
?
<EOS>
It
make
a
dog
fiercer
,
and
I
love
something
fierce
 
<EOS>
get
me
a
scissor
 
something
fierce
and
trim
!
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
infernal
affectation
 
<EOS>
devilish
conceit
<EOS>
it
be
,
to
cherish
our
ear
 
we
be
ass
enough
without

Hush

well
then

Damn

I
will
break

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Hareton
be
squall
and
kick
in
his
father
's
arm
with
all
his
might
,
and
redouble
his
yell
when
he
carry
him
up
-
stair
and
lift
him
over
the
banister
.
<EOS>
I
cry
out
that
he
would
frighten
the
child
into
fit
,
and
run
to
rescue
him
.
<EOS>
as
I
reach
them
,
Hindley
leant
forward
on
the
rail
to
listen
to
a
noise
below
;
almost
forget
what
he
have
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
hear
some
one
approach
the
stairs'-foot
.
<EOS>
I
leant
forward
also
,
for
the
purpose
of
signing
to
Heathcliff
,
whose
step
I
recognise
,
not
to
come
further
;
and
,
at
the
instant
when
my
eye
quit
Hareton
,
he
give
a
sudden
spring
,
deliver
himself
from
the
careless
grasp
that
hold
him
,
and
fall
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
scarcely
time
to
experience
a
thrill
of
horror
before
we
see
that
the
little
wretch
be
safe
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
arrive
underneath
just
at
the
critical
moment
;
by
a
natural
impulse
he
arrest
his
descent
,
and
set
him
on
his
foot
,
look
up
to
discover
the
author
of
the
accident
.
<EOS>
a
miser
who
have
part
with
a
lucky
lottery
ticket
for
five
shilling
,
and
find
next
day
he
have
lose
in
the
bargain
five
thousand
pound
,
could
not
show
a
blanker
countenance
than
he
do
on
behold
the
figure
of
Mr.
Earnshaw
above
.
<EOS>
It
express
,
plainer
than
word
could
do
,
the
intense
anguish
at
have
make
himself
the
instrument
of
thwart
his
own
revenge
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
dark
,
I
daresay
he
would
have
try
to
remedy
the
mistake
by
smash
Hareton
's
skull
on
the
step
;
but
,
we
witness
his
salvation
;
and
I
be
presently
below
with
my
precious
charge
press
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Hindley
descend
more
leisurely
,
sober
and
abash
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
fault
,
Ellen
,
"
he
say
;
"
you
should
have
keep
him
out
of
sight

you
should
have
take
him
from

he
injure
anywhere
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
injure
!

I
cry
angrily
;
"
if
he
be
not
kill
,
he
will
be
an
idiot

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
his
mother
do
not
rise
from
her
grave
to
see
how
you
use
him
.
<EOS>
You
be
bad
than
a
heathen
 
treat
your

blood
in

manner

<EOS>
He
attempt
to
touch
the
child
,
who
,
on
find
himself
with
me
,
sob
off
his
terror
directly
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
finger
his
father
lay
on
him
,
however
,
he
shriek
again
louder
than
before
,
and
struggle
as
if
he
would
go
into
convulsion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
meddle
with
him
!
"
<EOS>
I
continue
.

hate
you

man

his
hardness

at

convey
yourself

him
away

hark
you
,
Heathcliff

<EOS>
clear
you
too
quite
from
my
reach
and
hearing

<EOS>
I
would
not
murder
you
to

night
;
unless

perhaps
,
I
set
the
house
on
fire
:

that
be
as
my
fancy
go

<EOS>
while
say
this
he
take
a
pint
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
dresser
,
and
pour
some
into
a
tumbler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

do
not

I
entreat

<EOS>
Mr.
Hindley
,
do
take
warning

have
mercy
on

unfortunate
boy

have
mercy

snatch
the
glass
from

not

on
the
contrary

shall
have
great
pleasure

exclaim
the
blasphemer

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
be
to
its
hearty
damnation

<EOS>
He
drink
the
spirit
and
impatiently
bade
us
go
;
terminate
his
command
with
a
sequel
of
horrid
imprecation
too
bad
to
repeat

remember

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity

can

an
echo

curse
back

He
be

say
he
would
wager
his
mare
that
he
will
outlive
any
man
on
this
side
Gimmerton
,
and
go
to
the
grave
a
hoary
sinner
;
unless
some
happy
chance
out
of
the
common
course
befall
him
.

"
  
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
kitchen
,
and
sit
down
to
lull
my
little
lamb
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
as
I
think
,
walk
through
to
the
barn
.
<EOS>
It
turn
out
afterwards
that
he
only
get
as
far
as
the
other
side
the
settle
,
when
he
fling
himself
on
a
bench
by
the
wall
,
remove
from
the
fire
and
remain
silent
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
rock
Hareton
on
my
knee
,
and
hum
a
song
that
begin
,
    
<EOS>
It
be
far
in
the
night
,
and
the
bairnie
grat
,
the
mither
beneath
the
mool
hear
that
,
  
when
Miss
Cathy
,
who
have
listen
to
the
hubbub
from
her
room
,
put
her
head
in
,
and
whisper
,
 
"
be
you
alone
,
nelly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Miss
,
"
I
reply
.
  
<EOS>
She
enter
and
approach
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
I
,
suppose
she
be
go
to
say
something
,
look
up
.
<EOS>
the
expression
of
her
face
seem
disturbed
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
Her
lip
be
half
asund
,
as
if
she
mean
to
speak
,
and
she
draw
a
breath
;
but
it
escape
in
a
sigh
instead
of
a
sentence
.
<EOS>
I
resume
my
song
;
not
have
forget
her
recent
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Heathcliff
?

"
she
say
,
interrupt
me

<EOS>
"
about
his
work
in
the
stable

be
my
answer

<EOS>
He
do
not
contradict
me
;
perhaps
he
have
fall
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
there
follow
another
long
pause
,
during
which
I
perceive
a
drop
or
two
trickle
from
Catherine
's
cheek
to
the
flag
.
<EOS>
be
she
sorry
for
her
shameful
conduct
?

I
ask
myself

<EOS>
that
will
be
a
novelty

she
may
come
to
the
point

she
will

no

at

pursue
,
kneel
down
by
me

and
lift
her
winsome
eye
to
my
face
with
that
sort
of
look

turn
off
bad
temper

the

it

the

go
for

you

I.

I
have
dreamt

change
my

go

yes

remember
him

I

,
when
he
be
just
such
another

nearly

young

innocent

I
repeat
,
hastily

<EOS>
I
be
superstitious
about
dream
then
,

be
still
;

Catherine
have
an
unusual
gloom
in

that
make
me
dread
something

vex

up

tell
you

I
interrupt
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
laugh
,
and
hold
me
down
;
for
I
make
a
motion
to
leave
my
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
nothing
,
"
cry
she
:
"
I
be
only
go
to
say
that
heaven
do
not
seem
to
be
my
home

I
break
my
heart
with
weeping
to
come
back
to
earth
;
and
the
angel
be
so
angry
that
they
fling
me
out
into
the
middle
of
the
heath
on
the
top
of
Wuthering
Heights
;
where
I
wake
sob
for
joy
.
<EOS>
that
will
do
to
explain
my
secret
,
as
well

the
other

<EOS>
I
have
no
more
business
to
marry
Edgar
Linton
than
I
have
to
be
in
heaven
;
and
if
the
wicked
man
in
there
have
not
bring
Heathcliff
so
low
,
I
should
not
have
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
degrade
me
to
marry
Heathcliff
now
;
so
he
shall
never
know
how
I
love
him
:
and
that
,
not
because
he
be
handsome

nelly

but
because
he
be
more
myself

I
be
.
<EOS>
whatever
our
soul
be
make
of
,
his
and
mine
be
the
same
;
and
Linton
's
be
as
different
as
a
moonbeam
from
lightning
,
or
frost
from
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ere
this
speech
end
I
become
sensible
of
Heathcliff
's
presence
.
<EOS>
have
notice
a
slight
movement
,
I
turn
my
head
,
and
see
him
rise
from
the
bench
,
and
steal
out
noiselessly
.
<EOS>
He
have
listen
till
he
hear
Catherine
say
it
would
degrade
her
to
marry
him
,
and
then
he
stay
to
hear
no
further
.
<EOS>
My
companion
,
sit
on
the
ground
,
be
prevent
by
the
back
of
the
settle
from
remark
his
presence
or
departure
;
but
I
start
,
and
bade
her
hush
!
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
gaze
nervously
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
be
here
,
"
I
answer
,
catch
opportunely
the
roll
of
his
cartwheel
up
the
road
;
"
and
Heathcliff
will
come
in
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
whether
he
be
not
at
the
door
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
could
not
overhear
me
at

door

<EOS>
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
me
Hareton
,
while
you
get
the
supper
,
and
when
it
be
ready
ask
me
to
sup
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
cheat
my
uncomfortable
conscience
,
and
be
convince
that
Heathcliff
have
no
notion
of
these
thing
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
have
he
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
what
be
in
love
be
!

<EOS>
"
I
see
no
reason
that
he
should
not
know
,
as
well
as
you

I
return
;
"

if
you
be
his
choice

most
unfortunate

soon

lose

all

have
you
consider
how
you
will
bear
the
separation

how
he
will
bear
to
be
quite
desert
in
the
world

<EOS>
because
,
Miss
Catherine
 
"
  
"
He
quite
desert

separate

she
exclaim

with
an
accent
of
indignation

<EOS>
"
who
be

separate
us
,
pray
?
<EOS>
They
will
meet
the
fate
of
Milo

<EOS>
not

long

I
live

Ellen

<EOS>
every
Linton
on
the
face

earth
may
melt
into
nothing

I
could
consent
to
forsake
Heathcliff

<EOS>
oh

that
be
not
what
I
intend
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
what
I

<EOS>
I
should
not

Mrs.
Linton

such
a
price
demand

<EOS>
He
will
be
as
much
to
me
as
he
have
be
all
his
lifetime

<EOS>
Edgar
must
shake
off
his
antipathy
,
and
tolerate
him
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
He
will
,
when
he
learn
my
true
feeling
towards
him
.
<EOS>
nelly
,
I
see
now
you
think
me
a
selfish
wretch
;
but
do
it
never
strike
you
that
if
Heathcliff
and
I
marry
,
we
should
be
beggar
?
<EOS>
whereas
,
if
I
marry
Linton
I
can
aid
Heathcliff
to
rise
,
and
place
him
out
of
my
brother
's
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
your
husband
's
money
,
Miss
Catherine
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
him
not
so
pliable
as
you
calculate
upon
:
and
,
though
I
be
hardly
a
judge
,
I
think
that
be
the
bad
motive
you
have
give
yet
for
be
the
wife
of
young
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not

retort
she
;
"
it
be
the
good
!
<EOS>
the
other
be
the
satisfaction
of
my
whim
:
and
for
Edgar
's
sake
,
too
,
to
satisfy
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
for
the
sake
of
one
who
comprehend
in
his
person
my
feeling
to
Edgar
and
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
it
;
but
surely
you
and
everybody
have
a
notion
that
there
be
or
should
be
an
existence
of
your
beyond
you
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
my
creation
,
if
I
be
entirely
contain
here
?
<EOS>
My
great
misery
in
this
world
have
be
Heathcliff
's
misery
,

I
watch
and
feel
each
from
the
beginning
:
my
great
thought
in
living
be
himself

<EOS>
if
all
else
perish

_
<EOS>
he
_
remain

I

should
still
continue
to
be
;
and
if
all
else
remain
,
and
he
be
annihilate
,
the
universe
would
turn
to
a
mighty
stranger
:
<EOS>
I
should
not
seem
a
part
of
it

<EOS>
My
love
for
Linton
be
like
the
foliage
in
the
wood
<EOS>
:
time
will
change
it
,
I
be
well
aware
,
as
winter
change
the
tree
.
<EOS>
My
love
for
Heathcliff
resemble
the
eternal
rock
beneath

a
source
of
little
visible
delight
,

necessary
.
<EOS>
nelly
,
I

be

Heathcliff

He
be
always

always
in

not
as
a
pleasure

any
more
than
I
be
always
a
pleasure
to
myself

as

do
not
talk
of
our
separation
again

it
be
impracticable
;

"
  
She
pause
,
and
hide
her
face
in
the
fold
of
my
gown
;
but
I
jerk
it
forcibly
away
.
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
patience
with
her
folly
!
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
make
any
sense
of
your
nonsense
,
Miss
,
"
I
say
,
"
it
only
go
to
convince
me
that
you
be
ignorant
of
the
duty
you
undertake
in
marry
;
or
else
that
you
be
a
wicked
,
unprincipled
girl
.
<EOS>
but
trouble
me
with
no
more
secret
:
<EOS>
I
will
not
promise
to
keep
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
keep
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
will
not
promise
,
"
I
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
about
to
insist
,
when
the
entrance
of
Joseph
finish
our
conversation
;
and
Catherine
remove
her
seat
to
a
corner
,
and
nurse
Hareton
,
while
I
make
the
supper
.
<EOS>
after
it
be
cook
,
my
fellow
-
servant
and
I
begin
to
quarrel
who
should
carry
some
to
Mr.
Hindley
;
and
we
do
not
settle
it
till
all
be
nearly
cold
.
<EOS>
then
we
come
to
the
agreement
that
we
would
let
him
ask
,
if
he
want
any
;
for
we
fear
particularly
to
go
into
his
presence
when
he
have
be
some
time
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
be
not
that

come
in

this

<EOS>
what
be
he
about

<EOS>
girt
idle
seeght

<EOS>
"
demand
the
old
man
,
look
round
for
Heathcliff

<EOS>
"
I
will
call
him
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
the
barn
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
and
call
,
but
get
no
answer
.
<EOS>
on
return
,
I
whisper
to
Catherine
that
he
have
hear
a
good
part
of
what
she
say
,
I
be
sure
;
and
tell
how
I
see
him
quit
the
kitchen
just
as
she
complain
of
her
brother
's
conduct
regard
him
.
<EOS>
She
jump
up
in
a
fine
fright
,
fling
Hareton
on
to
the
settle
,
and
run
to
seek
for
her
friend
herself
;
not
take
leisure
to
consider
why
she
be
so
flurried
,
or
how
her
talk
would
have
affect
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
absent
such
a
while
that
Joseph
propose
we
should
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
cunningly
conjecture
they
be
stay
away
in
order
to
avoid
hear
his
protract
blessing
.
<EOS>
They
be
"
ill
eneugh
for
ony
fahl
manner
,
"
he
affirm
.
<EOS>
and
on
their
behalf
he
add
that
night
a
special
prayer
to
the
usual
quarter
-
of
-
an
-
hour
's
supplication
before
meat
,
and
would
have
tack
another
to
the
end
of
the
grace
,
have
not
his
young
mistress
break
in
upon
him
with
a
hurried
command
that
he
must
run
down
the
road
,
and
,
wherever
Heathcliff
have
ramble
,
find
and
make
him
re
-
enter
directly
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
him

must
_
,
before

go
upstairs
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
the
gate
be
open
:
he
be
somewhere
out
of
hearing
;
for
he
would
not
reply
,
though
I
shout
at
the
top
of
the
fold
as
loud
as
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
object
at
first
;
she
be
too
much
in
earnest
,
however
,
to
suffer
contradiction
;
and
at
last
he
place
his
hat
on
his
head
,
and
walk
grumble
forth
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
Catherine
pace
up
and
down
the
floor
,
exclaim
 
<EOS>
"

I
cry

rather
uneasy
myself
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
trifle
scare
you
!
<EOS>
It
be
surely
no
great
cause
of
alarm
that
Heathcliff
should
take
a
moonlight
saunter
on
the
moor
,

even
lie

sulky

to

It
_
be
_
a
very
dark
evening
for
summer
:
the
cloud
appear
inclined
to
thunder
,
and
I
say
we
have
better
all
sit
down
;
the
approach
rain
would
be
certain
to
bring
him
home
without
further
trouble
.
<EOS>
however
,
Catherine
would
not
be
persuade
into
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
She
keep
wander
to
and
fro
,
from
the
gate
to
the
door
,
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
permit
no
repose
;
and
at
length
take
up
a
permanent
situation
on
one
side
of
the
wall
,
near
the
road
:
where
,
heedless
of
my
expostulation
and
the
growl
thunder
,
and
the
great
drop
that
begin
to
plash
around
her
,
she
remain
,
call
at
interval
,
and
then
listen
,
and
then
cry
outright
.
<EOS>
She
beat
Hareton
,
or
any
child
,
at
a
good
passionate
fit
of
cry
.
  
<EOS>
about
midnight
,
while
we
still
sit
up
,
the
storm
come
rattle
over
the
Heights
in
full
fury
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
violent
wind
,
as
well
as
thunder
,
and
either
one
or
the
other
split
a
tree
off
at
the
corner
of
the
building
:
a
huge
bough
fall
across
the
roof
,
and
knock
down
a
portion
of
the
east
chimney
-
stack
,
send
a
clatter
of
stone
and
soot
into
the
kitchen
-
fire
.
<EOS>
We
think
a
bolt
have
fall
in
the
middle
of
us
;
and
Joseph
swing
on
to
his
knee
,
beseech
the
Lord
to
remember
the
patriarch
Noah
and
Lot
,
and
,
as
in
former
time
,
spare
the
righteous
,
though
he
smote
the
ungodly
.
<EOS>
I
feel
some
sentiment
that
it
must
be
a
judgment
on
us
also
.
<EOS>
the
Jonah
,
in
my
mind
,
be
Mr.
Earnshaw
;
and
I
shake
the
handle
of
his
den
that
I
may
ascertain
if
he
be
yet
live
.
<EOS>
He
reply
audibly
enough
,
in
a
fashion
which
make
my
companion
vociferate
,
more
clamorously
than
before
,
that
a
wide
distinction
may
be
draw
between
saint
like
himself
and
sinner
like
his
master
.
<EOS>
but
the
uproar
pass
away
in
twenty
minute
,
leave
us
all
unharmed
;
except
Cathy
,
who
get
thoroughly
drench
for
her
obstinacy
in
refuse
to
take
shelter
,
and
stand
bonnetless
and
shawl
-
less
to
catch
as
much
water
as
she
could
with
her
hair
and
clothe
.
<EOS>
She
come
in
and
lie
down
on
the
settle
,
all
soak
as
she
be
,
turn
her
face
to
the
back
,
and
put
her
hand
before
it

<EOS>
"

touch
her

<EOS>
He
guess
<EOS>
we
should
not
wait
for
him
till
this
late
hour
:
at
least
,
he
guess
that
only
Mr.
Hindley
would
be
up
;
and
he
would
rather
avoid
have
the
door
open
by
the
master
.

verse
where
we
may
find
them

<EOS>
I

have
vainly
beg
the
wilful
girl
to
rise
and
remove
her
wet
thing

leave

shivering

betook
myself
to

I
hear
Joseph
read
on
a
while
afterwards

I
distinguish
his
slow
step
on

then
I
drop
asleep

come
down

later

neither

be
a
confound
simpleton
!
<EOS>
but
never
mind
Linton
at
present
:
tell
me
,
be
you
not
with
Heathcliff
last
night
?
<EOS>
speak
the
truth
,
now
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
harm
him
:
though
I
hate
him
as
much
as
ever
,
he
do
me
a
good
turn
a
short
time
since
that
will
make
my
conscience
tender
of
break
his
neck
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
it
,
I
shall
send
him
about
his
business
this
very
morning
;
and
after
he
be
go
,
I
would
advise
you
all
to
look
sharp
<EOS>
:
I
shall
only
have
the
more
humour
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
Heathcliff
last
night
,
"
answer
Catherine
,
begin
to
sob
bitterly
:
"
and
if
you
do
turn
him
out
of
door
,
I
will
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
you
will
never
have
an
opportunity
:
perhaps
,
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
she
burst
into
uncontrollable
grief
,
and
the
remainder
of
her
word
be
inarticulate
.
  
<EOS>
Hindley
lavish
on
her
a
torrent
of
scornful
abuse
,
and
bade
her
get
to
her
room
immediately
,
or
she
should
not
cry
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
oblige
her
to
obey
;
and
I
shall
never
forget
what
a
scene
she
act
when
we
reach
her
chamber
:
it
terrify
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
go
mad
,
and
I
beg
Joseph
to
run
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
It
prove
the
commencement
of
delirium
:
Mr.
Kenneth
,
as
soon
as
he
see
her
,
pronounce
her
dangerously
ill
;
she
have
a
fever
.
<EOS>
He
bleed
her
,
and
he
tell
me
to
let
her
live
on
whey
and
water
-
gruel
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
she
do
not
throw
herself
downstairs
or
out
of
the
window
;
and
then
he
leave
:
for
he
have
enough
to
do
in
the
parish
,
where
two
or
three
mile
be
the
ordinary
distance
between
cottage
and
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
can
not
say
I
make
a
gentle
nurse
,
and
Joseph
and
the
master
be
no
well
,
and
though
our
patient
be
as
wearisome
and
headstrong
as
a
patient
could
be
,
she
weather
it
through
.
<EOS>
Old
Mrs.
Linton
pay
us
several
visit
,
to
be
sure
,
and
set
thing
to
right
,
and
scold
and
order
us
all
;
and
when
Catherine
be
convalescent
,
she
insist
on
convey
her
to
Thrushcross
grange
:
for
which
deliverance
we
be
very
grateful
.
<EOS>
but
the
poor
dame
have
reason
to
repent
of
her
kindness
:
she
and
her
husband
both
take
the
fever
,
and
die
within
a
few
day
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Our
young
lady
return
to
us
saucy
and
more
passionate
,
and
haughty
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
have
never
be
hear
of
since
the
evening
of
the
thunder
-
storm
;
and
,
one
day
,
I
have
the
misfortune
,
when
she
have
provoke
me
exceedingly
,
to
lay
the
blame
of
his
disappearance
on
her
:
<EOS>
where
indeed
it
belong
,
as
she
well
know
.
<EOS>
from
that
period
,
for
several
month
,
she
cease
to
hold
any
communication
with
me
,
save
in
the
relation
of
a
mere
servant
.
<EOS>
Joseph
fall
under
a
ban
also
:
he
would
speak
his
mind
,
and
lecture
her
all
the
same
as
if
she
be
a
little
girl
;
and
she
esteem
herself
a
woman
,
and
our
mistress
,
and
think
that
her
recent
illness
give
her
a
claim
to
be
treat
with
consideration
.
<EOS>
then
the
doctor
have
say
that
she
would
not
bear
cross
much
;
she
ought
to
have
her
own
way
;
and
it
be
nothing
less
than
murder
in
her
eye
for
any
one
to
presume
to
stand
up
and
contradict
her
.
<EOS>
from
Mr.
Earnshaw
and
his
companion
she
keep
aloof
;
and
tutor
by
Kenneth
,
and
serious
threat
of
a
fit
that
often
attend
her
rage
,
her
brother
allow
her
whatever
she
please
to
demand
,
and
generally
avoid
aggravate
her
fiery
temper
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
too
indulgent
in
humour
her
caprice
;
not
from
affection
,
but
from
pride
:
he
wish
earnestly
to
see
her
bring
honour
to
the
family
by
an
alliance
with
the
Lintons
,
and
as
long
as
she
let
him
alone
<EOS>
she
may
trample
on
us
like
slave
,
for
aught
he
care
!
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
,
as
multitude
have
be
before
and
will
be
after
him
,
be
infatuate
:
and
believe
himself
the
happy
man
alive
on
the
day
he
lead
her
to
Gimmerton
Chapel
,
three
year
subsequent
to
his
father
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
much
against
my
inclination
,
I
be
persuade
to
leave
Wuthering
Heights
and
accompany
her
here
.
<EOS>
little
Hareton
be
nearly
five
year
old
,
and
I
have
just
begin
to
teach
him
his
letter
.
<EOS>
We
make
a
sad
parting
;
but
Catherine
's
tear
be
more
powerful
than
ours
.
<EOS>
when
I
refuse
to
go
,
and
when
she
find
her
entreaty
do
not
move
me
,
she
go
lament
to
her
husband
and
brother
.
<EOS>
the
former
offer
me
munificent
wage
;
the
latter
order
me
to
pack
up
:
he
want
no
woman
in
the
house
,
he
say
,
now
that
there
be
no
mistress
;
and
as
to
Hareton
,
the
curate
should
take
him
in
hand
,
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
choice
leave
:
to
do
as
I
be
order
.
<EOS>
I
tell
the
master
he
get
rid
of
all
decent
people
only
to
run
to
ruin
a
little
faster
;
I
kiss
Hareton
,
say
good
-
by
;
and
since
then
he
have
be
a
stranger
:
and
it
be
very
queer
to
think
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
have
completely
forget
all
about
Ellen
Dean
,
and
that
he
be
ever
more
than
all
the
world
to
her
<EOS>
and
she
to
him
!
     
<EOS>
at
this
point
of
the
housekeeper
's
story
she
chance
to
glance
towards
the
time
-
piece
over
the
chimney
;
and
be
in
amazement
on
see
the
minute
-
hand
measure
half
-
past
one
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
hear
of
stay
a
second
longer
:
in
truth
,
I
feel
rather
disposed
to
defer
the
sequel
of
her
narrative
myself
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
she
be
vanish
to
her
rest
,
and
I
have
meditate
for
another
hour
or
two
,
I
shall
summon
courage
to
go
also
,
in
spite
of
ache
laziness
of
head
and
limb
.
    
<EOS>
a
charm
introduction
to
a
hermit
's
life
!
<EOS>
four
week
'
torture
,
tossing
,
and
sickness
!
<EOS>
oh
,
these
bleak
wind
and
bitter
northern
sky
,
and
impassable
road
,
and
dilatory
country
surgeon
!
<EOS>
and
oh
,
this
dearth
of
the
human
physiognomy
!
<EOS>
and
,
bad
than
all
,
the
terrible
intimation
of
Kenneth
that
I
need
not
expect
to
be
out
of
door
till
spring
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
have
just
honour
me
with
a
call
.
<EOS>
about
seven
day
ago
he
send
me
a
brace
of
grouse
 
the
last
of
the
season
.
<EOS>
Scoundrel
!
<EOS>
He
be
not
altogether
guiltless
in
this
illness
of
mine
;
and
that
I
have
a
great
mind
to
tell
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
offend
a
man
who
be
charitable
enough
to
sit
at
my
bedside
a
good
hour
,
and
talk
on
some
other
subject
than
pill
and
draught
,
blister
and
leech
?
<EOS>
this
be
quite
an
easy
interval
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
weak
to
read
;
yet
I
feel
as
if
I
could
enjoy
something
interesting
.
<EOS>
why
not
have
up
Mrs.
Dean
to
finish
her
tale
?
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
its
chief
incident
,
as
far
as
she
have
go
.
<EOS>
yes
:
I
remember
her
hero
have
run
off
,
and
never
be
hear
of
for
three
year
;
and
the
heroine
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
will
ring
:
she
will
be
delighted
to
find
me
capable
of
talk
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
want
twenty
minute
,
sir
,
to
take
the
medicine
,
"
she
commence
.
  
<EOS>
"
away
,
away
with
it
!
"
I
reply
;
"
I
desire
to
have
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
the
doctor
say
you
must
drop
the
powder
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
all
my
heart
!
<EOS>
do
not
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
come
and
take
your
seat
here
.
<EOS>
keep
your
finger
from
that
bitter
phalanx
of
vial
.
<EOS>
draw
your
knitting
out
of
your
pocket
 
that
will
do
 
now
continue
the
history
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
from
where
you
leave
off
,
to
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
do
he
finish
his
education
on
the
continent
,
and
come
back
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
or
do
he
get
a
sizar
's
place
at
college
,
or
escape
to
America
,
and
earn
honour
by
draw
blood
from
his
foster
-
country
?
<EOS>
or
make
a
fortune
more
promptly
on
the
english
highway
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
have
do
a
little
in
all
these
vocation
,
Mr.
Lockwood
;
but
I
could
not
give
my
word
for
any
.
<EOS>
I
state
before
that
I
do
not
know
how
he
gain
his
money
;
neither
be
I
aware
of
the
mean
he
take
to
raise
his
mind
from
the
savage
ignorance
into
which
it
be
sink
:
but
,
with
your
leave
,
I
will
proceed
in
my
own
fashion
,
if
you
think
it
will
amuse
and
not
weary
you
.
<EOS>
be
you
feel
well
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
get
Miss
Catherine
and
myself
to
Thrushcross
grange
;
and
,
to
my
agreeable
disappointment
,
she
behave
infinitely
better
than
I
dare
to
expect
.
<EOS>
She
seem
almost
over
-
fond
of
Mr.
Linton
;
and
even
to
his
sister
she
show
plenty
of
affection
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
very
attentive
to
her
comfort
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
thorn
bend
to
the
honeysuckle
,
but
the
honeysuckle
embrace
the
thorn
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
mutual
concession
:
one
stand
erect
,
and
the
other
yield
:
and
who
can
be
ill
-
natured
and
bad
-
tempered
when
they
encounter
neither
opposition
nor
indifference
?
<EOS>
I
observe
that
Mr.
Edgar
have
a
deep
-
root
fear
of
ruffle
her
humour
.
<EOS>
He
conceal
it
from
her
;
but
if
ever
he
hear
me
answer
sharply
,
or
see
any
other
servant
grow
cloudy
at
some
imperious
order
of
hers
,
he
would
show
his
trouble
by
a
frown
of
displeasure
that
never
darken
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
He
many
a
time
speak
sternly
to
me
about
my
pertness
;
and
aver
that
the
stab
of
a
knife
could
not
inflict
a
bad
pang
than
he
suffer
at
see
his
lady
vexed
.
<EOS>
not
to
grieve
a
kind
master
,
I
learn
to
be
less
touchy
;
and
,
for
the
space
of
half
a
year
,
the
gunpowder
lie
as
harmless
as
sand
,
because
no
fire
come
near
to
explode
it
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
season
of
gloom
and
silence
now
and
then
:
they
be
respect
with
sympathise
silence
by
her
husband
,
who
ascribe
them
to
an
alteration
in
her
constitution
,
produce
by
her
perilous
illness
;
as
she
be
never
subject
to
depression
of
spirit
before
.
<EOS>
the
return
of
sunshine
be
welcome
by
answer
sunshine
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
assert
that
they
be
really
in
possession
of
deep
and
grow
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
It
end
.
<EOS>
well
,
we
_
must
_
be
for
ourselves
in
the
long
run
;
the
mild
and
generous
be
only
more
justly
selfish
than
the
domineering
;
and
it
end
when
circumstance
cause
each
to
feel
that
the
one
's
interest
be
not
the
chief
consideration
in
the
other
's
thought
.
<EOS>
on
a
mellow
evening
in
September
,
I
be
come
from
the
garden
with
a
heavy
basket
of
apple
which
I
have
be
gather
.
<EOS>
It
have
get
dusk
,
and
the
moon
look
over
the
high
wall
of
the
court
,
cause
undefined
shadow
to
lurk
in
the
corner
of
the
numerous
projecting
portion
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
I
set
my
burden
on
the
house
-
step
by
the
kitchen
-
door
,
and
linger
to
rest
,
and
draw
in
a
few
more
breath
of
the
soft
,
sweet
air
;
my
eye
be
on
the
moon
,
and
my
back
to
the
entrance
,
when
I
hear
a
voice
behind
me
say
,
 
"
nelly
,
be
that
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
deep
voice
,
and
foreign
in
tone
;
yet
there
be
something
in
the
manner
of
pronounce
my
name
which
make
it
sound
familiar
.
<EOS>
I
turn
about
to
discover
who
speak
,
fearfully
;
for
the
door
be
shut
,
and
I
have
see
nobody
on
approach
the
step
.
<EOS>
something
stir
in
the
porch
;
and
,
move
nearer
,
I
distinguish
a
tall
man
dress
in
dark
clothe
,
with
dark
face
and
hair
.
<EOS>
He
lean
against
the
side
,
and
hold
his
finger
on
the
latch
as
if
intend
to
open
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
who
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
I
think
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
the
voice
have
no
resemblance
to
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
wait
here
an
hour
,
"
he
resume
,
while
I
continue
stare
;
"
and
the
whole
of
that
time
all
round
have
be
as
still
as
death
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
enter
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
me
?
<EOS>
look
,
I
be
not
a
stranger
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
ray
fall
on
his
feature
;
the
cheek
be
sallow
,
and
half
cover
with
black
whisker
;
the
brow
lower
,
the
eye
deep
-
set
and
singular
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
uncertain
whether
to
regard
him
as
a
worldly
visitor
,
and
I
raise
my
hand
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
come
back
?
<EOS>
be
it
really
you
?
<EOS>
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Heathcliff
,
"
he
reply
,
glance
from
me
up
to
the
window
,
which
reflect
a
score
of
glitter
moon
,
but
show
no
light
from
within
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
they
at
home
?
<EOS>
where
be
she
?
<EOS>
nelly
,
you
be
not
glad
!
<EOS>
you
need
not
be
so
disturbed
.
<EOS>
be
she
here
?
<EOS>
speak
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
one
word
with
her
 
your
mistress
.
<EOS>
go
,
and
say
some
person
from
Gimmerton
desire
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
will
she
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
what
will
she
do
?
<EOS>
the
surprise
bewilder
me
 
<EOS>
it
will
put
her
out
of
her
head
!
<EOS>
and
you
_
be
_
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
but
altered
!
<EOS>
nay
,
there
be
no
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
have
you
be
for
a
soldier
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
and
carry
my
message
,
"
he
interrupt
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
hell
till
you
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
lift
the
latch
,
and
I
enter
;
but
when
I
get
to
the
parlour
where
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Linton
be
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
resolve
on
make
an
excuse
to
ask
if
they
would
have
the
candle
light
,
and
I
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
together
in
a
window
whose
lattice
lie
back
against
the
wall
,
and
display
,
beyond
the
garden
tree
,
and
the
wild
green
park
,
the
valley
of
Gimmerton
,
with
a
long
line
of
mist
wind
nearly
to
its
top
(
for
very
soon
after
you
pass
the
chapel
,
as
you
may
have
notice
,
the
sough
that
run
from
the
marsh
join
a
beck
which
follow
the
bend
of
the
glen
)
.
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
rise
above
this
silvery
vapour
;
but
our
old
house
be
invisible
;
it
rather
dip
down
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
both
the
room
and
its
occupant
,
and
the
scene
they
gaze
on
,
look
wondrously
peaceful
.
<EOS>
I
shrink
reluctantly
from
perform
my
errand
;
and
be
actually
go
away
leave
it
unsaid
,
after
have
put
my
question
about
the
candle
,
when
a
sense
of
my
folly
compel
me
to
return
,
and
mutter
,
<EOS>
"
a
person
from
Gimmerton
wish
to
see
you
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
want
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Linton
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
question
him
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
close
the
curtain
,
nelly
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
bring
up
tea
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
back
again
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
quit
the
apartment
;
Mr.
Edgar
inquire
,
carelessly
,
who
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
one
mistress
do
not
expect
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
Heathcliff
 
<EOS>
you
recollect
him
,
sir
 
who
use
to
live
at
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
the
gipsy
 
the
ploughboy
?
<EOS>
"
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
say
so
to
Catherine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
call
him
by
those
name
,
master
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
sadly
grieve
to
hear
you
.
<EOS>
She
be
nearly
heartbroken
when
he
run
off
.
<EOS>
I
guess
his
return
will
make
a
jubilee
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
walk
to
a
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
overlook
the
court
.
<EOS>
He
unfasten
it
,
and
leant
out
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
be
below
,
for
he
exclaim
quickly
:
"
do
not
stand
there
,
love
!
<EOS>
bring
the
person
in
,
if
it
be
anyone
particular
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
hear
the
click
of
the
latch
,
and
Catherine
fly
up
-
stair
,
breathless
and
wild
;
too
excited
to
show
gladness
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
by
her
face
,
you
would
rather
have
surmise
an
awful
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Edgar
,
Edgar
!
"
she
pant
,
fling
her
arm
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Edgar
darling
!
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
come
back
 
<EOS>
he
be
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
tighten
her
embrace
to
a
squeeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
cry
her
husband
,
crossly
,
"
do
not
strangle
me
for
that
!
<EOS>
He
never
strike
me
as
such
a
marvellous
treasure
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
be
frantic
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
not
like
him
,
"
she
answer
,
repress
a
little
the
intensity
of
her
delight
.
"
<EOS>
yet
,
for
my
sake
,
you
must
be
friend
now
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
him
to
come
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
"
he
say
,
"
into
the
parlour
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
else
?
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
vexed
,
and
suggest
the
kitchen
as
a
more
suitable
place
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
eye
him
with
a
droll
expression
 
half
angry
,
half
laugh
at
his
fastidiousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
add
,
after
a
while
;
"
I
can
not
sit
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Set
two
table
here
,
Ellen
:
one
for
your
master
and
Miss
Isabella
,
be
gentry
;
the
other
for
Heathcliff
and
myself
,
be
of
the
low
order
.
<EOS>
Will
that
please
you
,
dear
?
<EOS>
or
must
I
have
a
fire
light
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
give
direction
.
<EOS>
I
will
run
down
and
secure
my
guest
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
the
joy
be
too
great
to
be
real
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
about
to
dart
off
again
;
but
Edgar
arrest
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
You
_
bid
him
step
up
,
"
he
say
,
address
me
;
"
and
,
Catherine
,
try
to
be
glad
,
without
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
the
whole
household
nee
not
witness
the
sight
of
your
welcome
a
runaway
servant
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
descend
,
and
find
Heathcliff
wait
under
the
porch
,
evidently
anticipate
an
invitation
to
enter
.
<EOS>
He
follow
my
guidance
without
waste
of
word
,
and
I
usher
him
into
the
presence
of
the
master
and
mistress
,
whose
flushed
cheek
betray
sign
of
warm
talking
.
<EOS>
but
the
lady
's
glow
with
another
feeling
when
her
friend
appear
at
the
door
<EOS>
:
she
spring
forward
,
take
both
his
hand
,
and
lead
him
to
Linton
;
and
then
she
seize
Linton
's
reluctant
finger
and
crush
them
into
his
.
<EOS>
now
,
fully
reveal
by
the
fire
and
candlelight
,
I
be
amazed
,
more
than
ever
,
to
behold
the
transformation
of
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
He
have
grow
a
tall
,
athletic
,
well
-
form
man
;
beside
whom
my
master
seem
quite
slender
and
youth
-
like
.
<EOS>
His
upright
carriage
suggest
the
idea
of
his
have
be
in
the
army
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
be
much
old
in
expression
and
decision
of
feature
than
Mr.
Linton
's
;
it
look
intelligent
,
and
retain
no
mark
of
former
degradation
.
<EOS>
a
half
-
civilised
ferocity
lurk
yet
in
the
depressed
brow
and
eye
full
of
black
fire
,
but
it
be
subdue
;
and
his
manner
be
even
dignified
:
quite
divest
of
roughness
,
though
stern
for
grace
.
<EOS>
My
master
's
surprise
equal
or
exceed
mine
:
he
remain
for
a
minute
at
a
loss
how
to
address
the
ploughboy
,
as
he
have
call
him
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
drop
his
slight
hand
,
and
stand
look
at
him
coolly
till
he
choose
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
at
length
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
,
recall
old
time
,
would
have
me
give
you
a
cordial
reception
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
be
gratified
when
anything
occur
to
please
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
also
,
"
answer
Heathcliff
,
"
especially
if
it
be
anything
in
which
I
have
a
part
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
an
hour
or
two
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
a
seat
opposite
Catherine
,
who
keep
her
gaze
fix
on
him
<EOS>
as
if
she
fear
he
would
vanish
be
she
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
raise
his
to
her
often
:
a
quick
glance
now
and
then
suffice
;
but
it
flash
back
,
each
time
more
confidently
,
the
undisguised
delight
he
drink
from
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
much
absorb
in
their
mutual
joy
to
suffer
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
not
so
Mr.
Edgar
<EOS>
:
he
grow
pale
with
pure
annoyance
:
a
feeling
that
reach
its
climax
when
his
lady
rise
,
and
step
across
the
rug
,
seize
Heathcliff
's
hand
again
,
and
laugh
like
one
beside
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
think
it
a
dream
to
-
morrow
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
able
to
believe
that
I
have
see
,
and
touch
,
and
speak
to
you
once
more
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
cruel
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
deserve
this
welcome
.
<EOS>
to
be
absent
and
silent
for
three
year
,
and
never
to
think
of
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
little
more
than
you
have
think
of
me
,
"
he
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
of
your
marriage
,
Cathy
,
not
long
since
;
and
,
while
wait
in
the
yard
below
,
I
meditate
this
plan
 
just
to
have
one
glimpse
of
your
face
,
a
stare
of
surprise
,
perhaps
,
and
pretend
pleasure
;
afterwards
settle
my
score
with
Hindley
;
and
then
prevent
the
law
by
do
execution
on
myself
.
<EOS>
Your
welcome
have
put
these
idea
out
of
my
mind
;
but
beware
of
meet
me
with
another
aspect
next
time
!
<EOS>
nay
,
you
will
not
drive
me
off
again
.
<EOS>
You
be
really
sorry
for
me
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
fight
through
a
bitter
life
since
I
last
hear
your
voice
;
and
you
must
forgive
me
,
for
I
struggle
only
for
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
unless
we
be
to
have
cold
tea
,
please
to
come
to
the
table
,
"
interrupt
Linton
,
strive
to
preserve
his
ordinary
tone
,
and
a
due
measure
of
politeness
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
will
have
a
long
walk
,
wherever
he
may
lodge
to
-
night
;
and
I
be
thirsty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
her
post
before
the
urn
;
and
Miss
Isabella
come
,
summon
by
the
bell
;
then
,
have
hand
their
chair
forward
,
I
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
meal
hardly
endure
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
cup
be
never
fill
:
she
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
.
<EOS>
Edgar
have
make
a
slop
in
his
saucer
,
and
scarcely
swallow
a
mouthful
.
<EOS>
Their
guest
do
not
protract
his
stay
that
evening
above
an
hour
longer
.
<EOS>
I
ask
,
as
he
depart
,
if
he
go
to
Gimmerton
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
"
he
answer
:
"
Mr.
Earnshaw
invite
me
,
when
I
call
this
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
invite
_
him
_
!
<EOS>
and
_
he
_
call
on
Mr.
Earnshaw
!
<EOS>
I
ponder
this
sentence
painfully
,
after
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
be
he
turn
out
a
bit
of
a
hypocrite
,
and
come
into
the
country
to
work
mischief
under
a
cloak
?
<EOS>
I
muse
:
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
he
have
better
have
remain
away
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
be
waken
from
my
first
nap
by
Mrs.
Linton
glide
into
my
chamber
,
take
a
seat
on
my
bedside
,
and
pull
me
by
the
hair
to
rouse
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
rest
,
Ellen
,
"
she
say
,
by
way
of
apology
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
want
some
live
creature
to
keep
me
company
in
my
happiness
!
<EOS>
Edgar
be
sulky
,
because
I
be
glad
of
a
thing
that
do
not
interest
him
:
he
refuse
to
open
his
mouth
,
except
to
utter
pettish
,
silly
speech
;
and
he
affirm
I
be
cruel
and
selfish
for
wish
to
talk
when
he
be
so
sick
and
sleepy
.
<EOS>
He
always
contrive
to
be
sick
at
the
least
cross
!
<EOS>
I
give
a
few
sentence
of
commendation
to
Heathcliff
,
and
he
,
either
for
a
headache
or
a
pang
of
envy
,
begin
to
cry
:
so
I
get
up
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
use
be
it
praise
Heathcliff
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
as
lad
they
have
an
aversion
to
each
other
,
and
Heathcliff
would
hate
just
as
much
to
hear
him
praise
:
it
be
human
nature
.
<EOS>
let
Mr.
Linton
alone
about
him
,
unless
you
would
like
an
open
quarrel
between
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
it
not
show
great
weakness
?
"
pursue
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
envious
:
I
never
feel
hurt
at
the
brightness
of
Isabella
's
yellow
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
,
at
her
dainty
elegance
,
and
the
fondness
all
the
family
exhibit
for
her
.
<EOS>
even
you
,
nelly
,
if
we
have
a
dispute
sometimes
,
you
back
Isabella
at
once
;
and
I
yield
like
a
foolish
mother
<EOS>
:
I
call
her
a
darling
,
and
flatter
her
into
a
good
temper
.
<EOS>
It
please
her
brother
to
see
us
cordial
,
and
that
please
me
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
very
much
alike
:
they
be
spoiled
child
,
and
fancy
the
world
be
make
for
their
accommodation
;
and
though
I
humour
both
,
I
think
a
smart
chastisement
may
improve
them
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
mistaken
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
They
humour
you
:
I
know
what
there
would
be
to
do
if
they
do
not
.
<EOS>
You
can
well
afford
to
indulge
their
passing
whim
as
long
as
their
business
be
to
anticipate
all
your
desire
.
<EOS>
You
may
,
however
,
fall
out
,
at
last
,
over
something
of
equal
consequence
to
both
side
;
and
then
those
you
term
weak
be
very
capable
of
be
as
obstinate
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
we
shall
fight
to
the
death
,
<EOS>
sha'n't
we
,
nelly
?
<EOS>
"
she
return
,
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
I
have
such
faith
in
Linton
's
love
,
that
I
believe
I
may
kill
him
,
and
he
would
not
wish
to
retaliate

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
advise
her
to
value
him
the
more
for
his
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
she
answer
,
"
but
he
nee
not
resort
to
whine
for
trifle
.
<EOS>
It
be
childish
and
,
instead
of
melt
into
tear
because
I
say
that
Heathcliff
be
now
worthy
of
anyone
's
regard
,
and
it
would
honour
the
first
gentleman
in
the
country
to
be
his
friend
,
he
ought
to
have
say
it
for
me
,
and
be
delight
from
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
must
get
accustomed
to
him
,
and
he
may
as
well
like
him
:
consider
how
Heathcliff
have
reason
to
object
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
he
behave
excellently
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
his
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
reform
in
every
respect
,
apparently
:
quite
a
Christian
:
offer
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
his
enemy
all
around
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
explain
it
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
as
much
as
you
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
call
to
gather
information
concern
me
from
you
,
suppose
you
reside
there
still
;
and
Joseph
tell
Hindley
,
who
come
out
and
fall
to
question
him
of
what
he
have
be
do
,
and
how
he
have
be
live
;
and
finally
,
desire
him
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
person
sit
at
card
;
Heathcliff
join
them
;
my
brother
lose
some
money
to
him
,
and
,
find
him
plentifully
supply
,
he
request
that
he
would
come
again
in
the
evening
:
to
which
he
consent
.
<EOS>
Hindley
be
too
reckless
to
select
his
acquaintance
prudently
:
he
do
not
trouble
himself
to
reflect
on
the
cause
he
may
have
for
mistrust
one
whom
he
have
basely
injure
.
<EOS>
but
Heathcliff
affirm
his
principal
reason
for
resume
a
connection
with
his
ancient
persecutor
be
a
wish
to
install
himself
in
quarter
at
walk
distance
from
the
Grange
,
and
an
attachment
to
the
house
where
we
live
together
;
and
likewise
a
hope
that
I
shall
have
more
opportunity
of
see
him
there
than
I
could
have
if
he
settle
in
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
He
mean
to
offer
liberal
payment
for
permission
to
lodge
at
the
Heights
;
and
doubtless
my
brother
's
covetousness
will
prompt
him
to
accept
the
term
:
he
be
always
greedy
;
though
what
he
grasp
with
one
hand
he
fling
away
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
nice
place
for
a
young
man
to
fix
his
dwelling
in
!
"
<EOS>
say
I.
<EOS>
"
have
you
no
fear
of
the
consequence
,
Mrs.
Linton
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
for
my
friend
,
"
she
reply
:
"
his
strong
head
will
keep
him
from
danger
;
a
little
for
Hindley
:
but
he
can
not
be
make
morally
bad
than
he
be
;
and
I
stand
between
him
and
bodily
harm
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
this
evening
have
reconcile
me
to
God
and
humanity
!
<EOS>
I
have
rise
in
angry
rebellion
against
Providence
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
have
endure
very
,
very
bitter
misery
,
nelly
!
<EOS>
if
that
creature
know
how
bitter
,
he
would
be
ashamed
to
cloud
its
removal
with
idle
petulance
.
<EOS>
It
be
kindness
for
him
which
induce
me
to
bear
it
alone
:
have
I
express
the
agony
I
frequently
feel
,
he
would
have
be
teach
to
long
for
its
alleviation
as
ardently
as
I.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
over
,
and
I
will
take
no
revenge
on
his
folly
;
I
can
afford
to
suffer
anything
hereafter
!
<EOS>
Should
the
mean
thing
alive
slap
me
on
the
cheek
,
I
would
not
only
turn
the
other
,
but
I
would
ask
pardon
for
provoke
it
;
and
,
as
a
proof
,
I
will
go
make
my
peace
with
Edgar
instantly
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
!
<EOS>
I
be
an
angel
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
self
-
complacent
conviction
she
depart
;
and
the
success
of
her
fulfil
resolution
be
obvious
on
the
morrow
:
Mr.
Linton
have
not
only
abjure
his
peevishness
(
though
his
spirit
seem
still
subdue
by
Catherine
's
exuberance
of
vivacity
)
,
but
he
venture
no
objection
to
her
take
Isabella
with
her
to
Wuthering
Heights
in
the
afternoon
;
and
she
reward
him
with
such
a
summer
of
sweetness
and
affection
in
return
as
make
the
house
a
paradise
for
several
day
;
both
master
and
servant
profit
from
the
perpetual
sunshine
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
<EOS>
I
should
say
in
future
 
use
the
liberty
of
visit
at
Thrushcross
Grange
cautiously
,
at
first
:
<EOS>
he
seem
estimate
how
far
its
owner
would
bear
his
intrusion
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
also
,
deem
it
judicious
to
moderate
her
expression
of
pleasure
in
receive
him
;
and
he
gradually
establish
his
right
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
He
retain
a
great
deal
of
the
reserve
for
which
his
boyhood
be
remarkable
;
and
that
serve
to
repress
all
startling
demonstration
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
My
master
's
uneasiness
experience
a
lull
,
and
further
circumstance
divert
it
into
another
channel
for
a
space
.
  
<EOS>
His
new
source
of
trouble
spring
from
the
not
anticipate
misfortune
of
Isabella
Linton
evince
a
sudden
and
irresistible
attraction
towards
the
tolerate
guest
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
that
time
a
charming
young
lady
of
eighteen
;
infantile
in
manner
,
though
possess
of
keen
wit
,
keen
feeling
,
and
a
keen
temper
,
too
,
if
irritated
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
who
love
her
tenderly
,
be
appal
at
this
fantastic
preference
.
<EOS>
leave
aside
the
degradation
of
an
alliance
with
a
nameless
man
,
and
the
possible
fact
that
his
property
,
in
default
of
heir
male
,
may
pass
into
such
a
one
's
power
,
he
have
sense
to
comprehend
Heathcliff
's
disposition
:
to
know
that
,
though
his
exterior
be
alter
,
his
mind
be
unchangeable
and
unchanged
.
<EOS>
and
he
dread
that
mind
<EOS>
:
it
revolt
him
:
he
shrink
forebodingly
from
the
idea
of
commit
Isabella
to
its
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
recoil
still
more
<EOS>
have
he
be
aware
that
her
attachment
rise
unsolicited
,
and
be
bestow
where
it
awaken
no
reciprocation
of
sentiment
;
for
the
minute
he
discover
its
existence
he
lay
the
blame
on
Heathcliff
's
deliberate
designing
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
all
remark
,
during
some
time
,
that
Miss
Linton
fret
and
pine
over
something
.
<EOS>
She
grow
cross
and
wearisome
;
snap
at
and
tease
Catherine
continually
,
at
the
imminent
risk
of
exhaust
her
limited
patience
.
<EOS>
We
excuse
her
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
on
the
plea
of
ill
-
health
:
she
be
dwindle
and
fade
before
our
eye
.
<EOS>
but
one
day
,
when
she
have
be
peculiarly
wayward
,
reject
her
breakfast
,
complain
that
the
servant
do
not
do
what
she
tell
them
;
that
the
mistress
would
allow
her
to
be
nothing
in
the
house
,
and
Edgar
neglect
her
;
that
she
have
catch
a
cold
with
the
door
be
leave
open
,
and
we
let
the
parlour
fire
go
out
on
purpose
to
vex
her
,
with
a
hundred
yet
more
frivolous
accusation
,
Mrs.
Linton
peremptorily
insist
that
she
should
get
to
bed
;
and
,
have
scold
her
heartily
,
threaten
to
send
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
mention
of
Kenneth
cause
her
to
exclaim
,
instantly
,
that
her
health
be
perfect
,
and
it
be
only
Catherine
's
harshness
which
make
her
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
say
I
be
harsh
,
you
naughty
fondle
?
"
<EOS>
cry
the
mistress
,
amazed
at
the
unreasonable
assertion
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
surely
lose
your
reason
.
<EOS>
when
have
I
be
harsh
,
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yesterday
,
"
sob
Isabella
,
"
and
now
!
"
  
"
yesterday
!
"
say
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
on
what
occasion
?
"
  
"
in
our
walk
along
the
moor
:
you
tell
me
to
ramble
where
I
please
,
while
you
saunter
on
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
your
notion
of
harshness
?
"
say
Catherine
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
hint
that
your
company
be
superfluous
?
<EOS>
We
do
not
care
whether
you
keep
with
us
or
not
;
I
merely
think
Heathcliff
's
talk
would
have
nothing
entertaining
for
your
ear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
weep
the
young
lady
;
"
you
wish
me
away
,
because
you
know
I
like
to
be
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
sane
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Linton
,
appeal
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
repeat
our
conversation
,
word
for
word
,
Isabella
;
and
you
point
out
any
charm
it
could
have
have
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mind
the
conversation
,
"
she
answer
:
"
I
want
to
be
with
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
?
"
say
Catherine
,
perceive
her
hesitate
to
complete
the
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
him
:
and
I
will
not
be
always
send
off
!
"
<EOS>
she
continue
,
kindle
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
dog
in

Cathy

and
desire
no

yourself

exclaim
Mrs.
Linton
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
believe
this
idiotcy
!
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
you
can
covet
the
admiration
of
Heathcliff
 
that
you
consider
him
an
agreeable
person
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
misunderstood
you
,
Isabella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
you
have
not
,
"
say
the
infatuate
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
him
more
than
ever

love

may
love
me

if

him
!

<EOS>
"
I
would
not
be
you
for
a
kingdom
,
then
!
"
<EOS>
Catherine
declare
,
emphatically
:
and
she
seem
to
speak
sincerely
.
"
<EOS>
nelly
,
help
me
to
convince
her
of
her
madness
.
<EOS>
tell
her
what
Heathcliff
be
:
an
unreclaimed
creature
,
without
refinement
,
without
cultivation
;
an
arid
wilderness
of
furze
and
whinstone
.
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
put
that
little
canary
into
the
park
on
a
winter
's
day
,
as
recommend
you
to
bestow
your
heart
on
him
!
<EOS>
It
be
deplorable
ignorance
of
his
character
,
child
,
and
nothing
else
,
which
make
that
dream
enter
your
head
.
<EOS>
pray
,
do
not
imagine
that
he
conceal
depth
of
benevolence
and
affection
beneath
a
stern
exterior
!
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
rough
diamond
 
<EOS>
a
pearl
-
contain
oyster
of
a
rustic
<EOS>
:
he
be
a
fierce
,
pitiless
,
wolfish
man
.
<EOS>
I
never
say
to
him
,
"
let
this
or
that
enemy
alone
,
because
it
would
be
ungenerous
or
cruel
to
harm
them
;
"
I
say
,
"
let
them
alone
,
because
_
I
_
should
hate
them
to
be
wrong

"
<EOS>
and
he
would
crush
you
like
a
sparrow
's
egg
,
Isabella
,
if
he
find
you
a
troublesome
charge
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
could
not
love
a
Linton
;
and
yet
he
would
be
quite
capable
of
marry
your
fortune
and
expectation
:
<EOS>
avarice
be
grow
with
him
a
besetting
sin

<EOS>
there
be
my
picture
:
and
I
be
his
friend
 
so
much
so
,
that
have
he
think
seriously
to
catch
you
,
I
should
,
perhaps
,
have
hold
my
tongue
,
and
let
you
fall
into
his
trap

Miss
Linton
regard
her

indignation

Mr.

no

Mrs.
Linton
speak
strongly
,

yet
I
can
not
contradict
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
better
acquaint
with
his
heart
than
I
,
or
any
one
besides
;
and
she
never
would
represent
him
as
bad
than
he
be

honest

<EOS>
how

why

They

continually

on

silent

the

her
recent
indiscretion

and
the
disclosure
she
have
make
of
her
secret
feeling
in
a
transient
fit

on

really

Mr.

take

sure
she
make
some

she

fast

<EOS>
and
he
stare
hard
at
the
object
of
discourse
,
as
one
may
do
at
a
strange
repulsive
animal
:
a
centipede
from
the
Indies
,
for
instance
,
which
curiosity
lead
one
to
examine
in
spite
of
the
aversion
it
raise
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
could
not
bear
that
;
she
grow
white
and
red
in
rapid
succession
,
and
,
while
tear
bead
her
lash
,
bend
the
strength
of
her
small
finger
to
loosen
the
firm
clutch
of
Catherine
;
and
perceive
that
as
fast
as
she
raise
one
finger
off
her
arm
another
close
down
,
and
she
could
not
remove
the
whole
together
,
she
begin
to
make
use
of
her
nail
;
and
their
sharpness
presently
ornament
the
detainer

with
crescent
of
red

<EOS>
"
there
be
a
tigress

exclaim
Mrs.

set
her
free

shake
her
hand

pain

Begone

how
foolish

can
not
you
fancy
the
conclusion
he

draw

look

they

instrument

will
do
execution
 
you

<EOS>
"
I
would
wrench
them
off
her
finger

if

ever
menace
me

he
answer
,
brutally
,
when
the
door
have
close
after
her

"
<EOS>
but
what
do
you
mean
by
tease
the
creature
in
that
manner

Cathy

<EOS>
You
be
not

the
truth

<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
I
be

"
<EOS>
She
have
be
die
for
your
sake
several
week
,
and
rave
about
you
this
morning
,
and
pour
forth
a
deluge
of
abuse

because
I
represent
your
failing
in
a
plain
light
,
for
the
purpose
of
mitigate
her
adoration
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
notice
it
further
:
I
wish
to
punish
her
sauciness
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
I
like
her
too
well
,
my
dear
Heathcliff

to
let
you
absolutely
seize
and
devour
her
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
like
her
too
ill
to
attempt
it
,
"
say
he
,
"
except
in
a
very
ghoulish
fashion
.
<EOS>
You
would
hear
of
odd
thing
if
I
live
alone
with
that
mawkish
,
waxen
face
:
the
most
ordinary
would
be
paint
on
its
white
the
colour
of
the
rainbow
,
and
turn
the
blue
eye
black
,
every
day
or
two
:
they
detestably
resemble
Linton
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
delectably
!
"
observe
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
dive

's
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
her
brother
's
heir

be
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
after
a
brief
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
,
"
return
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
half
a
dozen
nephews
shall
erase
her
title
,
please
heaven
!
<EOS>
Abstract
your
mind
from
the
subject
at
present
<EOS>
:
you
be
too
prone
to
covet
your
neighbour
's
good
;
remember
_
this
_
neighbour
's
good
be
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
be
_
mine
_
,
they
would
be
none
the
less
that
,
"
say
Heathcliff
;
"
but
though
Isabella
Linton
may
be
silly
,
she
be
scarcely
mad
;
and
,
in
short
,
we
will
dismiss
the
matter
,
as
you
advise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
from
their
tongue
they
do
dismiss
it
;
and
Catherine
,
probably
,
from
her
thought
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
I
feel
certain
,
recall
it
often
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
smile
to
himself
 
grin
<EOS>
rather
 
and
lapse
into
ominous
musing
whenever
Mrs.
Linton
have
occasion
to
be
absent
from
the
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
I
determine
to
watch
his
movement
.
<EOS>
My
heart
invariably
cleave
to
the
master
's
,
in
preference
to
Catherine
's
side
:
with
reason
I
imagine
,
for
he
be
kind
,
and
trustful
,
and
honourable
;
and
she
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
be
call
_
opposite
_
,
yet
she
seem
to
allow
herself
such
wide
latitude
,
that
I
have
little
faith
in
her
principle
,
and
still
less
sympathy
for
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
want
something
to
happen
which
may
have
the
effect
of
free
both
Wuthering
Heights
and
the
grange
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
quietly
;
leave
us
as
we
have
be
prior
to
his
advent
.
<EOS>
His
visit
be
a
continual
nightmare
to
me
;
and
,
I
suspect
,
to
my
master
also
.
<EOS>
His
abode
at
the
Heights
be
an
oppression
past
explain
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
God
have
forsake
the
stray
sheep
there
to
its
own
wicked
wandering
,
and
an
evil
beast
prowl
between
it
and
the
fold
,
wait
his
time
to
spring
and
destroy
.
    
<EOS>
sometimes
,
while
meditate
on
these
thing
in
solitude
,
I
have
get
up
in
a
sudden
terror
,
and
put
on
my
bonnet
to
go
see
how
all
be
at
the
farm
.
<EOS>
I
have
persuade
my
conscience
that
it
be
a
duty
to
warn
him
how
people
talk
regard
his
way
;
and
then
I
have
recollect
his
confirm
bad
habit
,
and
,
hopeless
of
benefit
him
,
have
flinch
from
re
-
enter
the
dismal
house
,
doubt
if
I
could
bear
to
be
take
at
my
word
.
  
<EOS>
one
time
I
pass
the
old
gate
,
go
out
of
my
way
,
on
a
journey
to
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
period
that
my
narrative
have
reach
:
a
bright
frosty
afternoon
;
the
ground
bare
,
and
the
road
hard
and
dry
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
a
stone
where
the
highway
branch
off
on
to
the
moor
at
your
left
hand
;
a
rough
sand
-
pillar
,
with
the
letter
W.
H.
cut
on
its
north
side
,
on
the
east
,
G.
,
and
<EOS>
on
the
south
-
west
,
T.
G.
It
serve
as
a
guide
-
post
to
the
Grange
,
the
Heights
,
and
village
.
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
yellow
on
its
grey
head
,
remind
me
of
summer
;
and
I
can
not
say
why
,
but
all
at
once
a
gush
of
child
's
sensation
flow
into
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Hindley
and
I
hold
it
a
favourite
spot
twenty
year
before
.
<EOS>
I
gaze
long
at
the
weather
-
wear
block
;
and
,
stoop
down
,
perceive
a
hole
near
the
bottom
still
full
of
snail
-
shell
and
pebble
,
which
we
be
fond
of
store
there
with
more
perishable
thing
;
and
,
as
fresh
as
reality
,
it
appear
that
I
beheld
my
early
playmate
seat
on
the
withered
turf
:
his
dark
,
square
head
bend
forward
,
and
his
little
hand
scoop
out
the
earth
with
a
piece
of
slate
.
"
<EOS>
poor
Hindley
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
I
start
:
my
bodily
eye
be
cheat
into
a
momentary
belief
that
the
child
lift
its
face
and
stare
straight
into
mine
!
<EOS>
It
vanish
in
a
twinkling
;
but
immediately
I
feel
an
irresistible
yearning
to
be
at
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
superstition
urge
me
to
comply
with
this
impulse
:
supposing
he
should
be
dead
!
<EOS>
I
think
 
or
should
die
soon
!
 
<EOS>
supposing
it
be
a
sign
of
death
!
<EOS>
the
nearer
I
get
to
the
house
the
more
agitated
I
grow
;
and
on
catch
sight
of
it
I
tremble
in
every
limb
.
<EOS>
the
apparition
have
outstrip
me
:
it
stand
look
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
first
idea
on
observe
an
elf
-
lock
,
brown
-
eyed
boy
set
his
ruddy
countenance
against
the
bar
.
<EOS>
further
reflection
suggest
this
must
be
Hareton
,
_
<EOS>
my
_
Hareton
,
not
alter
greatly
since
I
leave
him
,
ten
month
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
thee
,
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
forget
instantaneously
my
foolish
fear
.
<EOS>
"
Hareton
,
it
be
nelly
!
<EOS>
nelly
,
thy
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
retreat
out
of
arm
's
length
,
and
pick
up
a
large
flint
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
see
thy
father
,
Hareton
,
"
I
add
,
guess
from
the
action
that
nelly
,
if
she
live
in
his
memory
at
all
,
be
not
recognise
as
one
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
raise
his
missile
to
hurl
it
;
I
commence
a
soothing
speech
,
but
could
not
stay
his
hand
:
the
stone
strike
my
bonnet
;
and
then
ensue
,
from
the
stammering
lip
of
the
little
fellow
,
a
string
of
curse
,
which
,
whether
he
comprehend
them
or
not
,
be
deliver
with
practised
emphasis
,
and
distort
his
baby
feature
into
a
shocking
expression
of
malignity
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
certain
this
grieve
more
than
anger
me
.
<EOS>
fit
to
cry
<EOS>
,
I
take
an

He

,
and
then
snatch
it
from
my
hold
;
as
if
he
fancy
I
only
intend
to
tempt
and
disappoint
him

I
ask

<EOS>
"
Naught

keep
out

again

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
curate
do
not
teach
you
to
read
and
write
,
then
?
"
I
pursue
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
tell
the
curate
should
have
his
 
tooth
dash
down
his
 
throat
,
<EOS>
if
he
step
over
the
threshold
 
Heathcliff
have
promise
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
the
orange
in
his
hand
,
and
bade
him
tell
his
father
that
a
woman
call
Nelly
Dean
be
wait
to
speak
with
him
,
by
the
garden
gate
.
<EOS>
He
go
up
the
walk
,
and
enter
the
house
;
but
,
instead
of
Hindley
,
Heathcliff
appear
on
the
door
-
stone
;
and
I
turn
directly
and
run
down
the
road
as
hard
as
ever
I
could
race
,
make
no
halt
till
I
gain
the
guide
-
post
,
and
feeling
as
scared
as
if
I
have
raise
a
goblin
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
much
connect
with
Miss
Isabella
's
affair
:
except
that
it
urge
me
to
resolve
further
on
mount
vigilant
guard
,
and
do
my
utmost
to
check
the
spread
of
such
bad
influence
at
the
grange
:
even
though
I
should
wake
a
domestic
storm
,
by
thwart
Mrs.
Linton
's
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
time
Heathcliff
come
my
young
lady
chance
to
be
feed
some
pigeon
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
speak
a
word
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
for
three
day
;
but
she
have
likewise
drop
her
fretful
complaining
,
and
we
find
it
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
have
not
the
habit
of
bestow
a
single
unnecessary
civility
on
Miss
Linton
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
soon
as
he
behold
her
,
his
first
precaution
be
to
take
a
sweeping
survey
of
the
house
-
front
.
<EOS>
I
be
stand
by
the
kitchen
-
window
,
but
I
draw
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
He
then
step
across
the
pavement
to
her
,
and
say
something
:
she
seem
embarrassed
,
and
desirous
of
get
away
;
to
prevent
it
,
he
lay
his
hand
on
her
arm
.
<EOS>
She
avert
her
face
:
he
apparently
put
some
question
which
she
have
no
mind
to
answer
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
rapid
glance
at
the
house
,
and
suppose
himself
unseen
,
the
scoundrel
have
the
impudence
to
embrace
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Judas
!
<EOS>
traitor
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculate
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
hypocrite
,
too
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
a
deliberate
deceiver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
,
nelly
?
"
say
Catherine
's
voice
at
my
elbow
:
I
have
be
over
-
intent
on
watch
the
pair
outside
to
mark
her
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
worthless
friend
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
warmly
:
"
the
sneak
rascal
yonder
.
<EOS>
ah
,
he
have
catch
a
glimpse
of
us
 
<EOS>
he
be
come
in
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
will
he
have
the
heart
to
find
a
plausible
excuse
for
make
love
to
Miss
,
when
he
tell
you
he
hate
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
see
Isabella
tear
herself
free
,
and
run
into
the
garden
;
and
a
minute
after
,
Heathcliff
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
withhold
give
some
loose
to
my
indignation
;
but
Catherine
angrily
insist
on
silence
,
and
threaten
to
order
me
out
of
the
kitchen
,
if
I
dare
to
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
put
in
my
insolent
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
hear
you

people
may
think
you

<EOS>
she
cry
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
God
forbid
that
he
should
try

answer
the
black
villain
.
<EOS>
I
detest
him
just
then

God

every
day

madder

<EOS>
"
Hush

say
Catherine
,
shut
the
inner
door

<EOS>
"
do
not

He

Heathcliff

I
could
do
as
well

as
to

I
have
a

the
tyrant

down

refrain

much
as
you

able

<EOS>
have
level
my
palace

do
not
erect
a

complacently
admire
your

charity

me

<EOS>
well

I

Quarrel
with
Edgar

if

Heathcliff

<EOS>
the
conversation
cease

<EOS>
Mrs.

sit
down
by
the
fire

flushed
and
gloomy

the
spirit

intractable

she

neither
lay
nor
control
it

<EOS>
He
stand
on
the
hearth
with
fold
arm

brood
on
his
evil
thought

in

position
I
leave
them

wonder

keep

long

She
be
sadly
put
out

behaviour

indeed
,
I
do

it
be
time
to
arrange
his
visit
on
another
footing

there
be
harm
in

soft

it

come
to
this

I
relate
the
scene
in
the
court

and
,
as
near
as
I
dare
,
the
whole
subsequent
dispute
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
it
could
not
be
very
prejudicial
to
Mrs.
Linton
;
unless
she
make
it
so
afterwards

by
assume
the
defensive
for
her
guest

Edgar
Linton
have
difficulty
in
hear
me
to

close

His
first
word
reveal
that
he
do
not
clear
his
wife
of
blame

<EOS>
"
this
be
insufferable
!

<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
disgraceful
that
she
should
own
him
for

force
his
company
on
me

call
me
two
man
out

hall

linger
no
longer

argue
with

low
ruffian

humour
her
enough

<EOS>
He
descend
,
and
bid
the
servant
wait
in
the
passage
,
go
,
follow
by
me
,
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Its
occupant
have
recommence
their
angry
discussion
:
Mrs.
Linton
,
at
least
,
be
scold
with
renew
vigour
;
Heathcliff
have
move
to
the
window
,
and
hang
his
head
,
somewhat
cow
by
her
violent
rating
apparently
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
master
first
,
and
make
a
hasty
motion
that
she
should
be
silent
;
which
she
obey
,
abruptly
,
on
discover
the
reason
of
his
intimation
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
this
?
"
say
Linton
,
address
her
;
"
what
notion
of
propriety
must
you
have
to
remain
here
,
after
the
language
which
have
be
hold
to
you
by
that
blackguard
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
because
it
be
his
ordinary
talk
you
think
nothing
of
it
:
you
be
habituate
to
his
baseness
,
and
,
perhaps
,
imagine
I
can
get
used
to
it
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
be
listen
at
the
door
,
Edgar
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
mistress
,
in
a
tone
particularly
calculate
to
provoke
her
husband
,
imply
both
carelessness
and
contempt
of
his
irritation
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
who
have
raise
his
eye
at
the
former
speech
,
give
a
sneering
laugh
at
the
latter
;
on
purpose
,
it
seem
,
to
draw
Mr.
Linton
's
attention
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
succeed
;
but
Edgar
do
not
mean
to
entertain
him
with
any
high
flight
of
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
so
far
forbear
with
you
,
sir
,
"
he
say
quietly
;
"
not
that
I
be
ignorant
of
your
miserable
,
degraded
character
,
but
I
feel
you
be
only
partly
responsible
for
that
;
and
Catherine
wish
to
keep
up
your
acquaintance
,
I
acquiesce
 
foolishly
.
<EOS>
Your
presence
be
a
moral
poison
that
would
contaminate
the
most
virtuous
:
for
that
cause
,
and
to
prevent
bad
consequence
,
I
shall
deny
you
hereafter
admission
into
this
house
,
and
give
notice
now
that
I
require
your
instant
departure
.
<EOS>
three
minute
'
delay
will
render
it
involuntary
and
ignominious
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
measure
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
speaker
with
an
eye
full
of
derision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cathy
,
this
lamb
of
yours

like
a
bull

say
.
<EOS>

It
be
in
danger
of
split
its
skull
against
my
knuckle

by
God
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
,
I
be
mortally
sorry
that
you
be
not
worth
knock
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
glance
towards
the
passage
,
and
sign
me
to
fetch
the
man
:
he
have
no
intention
of
hazard
a
personal
encounter
.
<EOS>
I
obey
the
hint
;
but
Mrs.
Linton
,
suspect
something
,
follow
;
and
when
I
attempt
to
call
them
,
she
pull
me
back
,
slam

<EOS>
It
do
not
need
the
medium
of
a
flogging
to
produce
that
effect
on
the
master

He
try
to
wrest
the
key
from
Catherine
's
grasp
,

for
safety
she
fling
it
into

hot
part

Mr.

be
take
with
a
nervous
trembling

his
countenance
grow
deadly
pale

<EOS>
for
his
life
he
could
not
avert
that
excess
of
emotion
:
mingle
anguish
and
humiliation
overcome
him
completely
.
<EOS>
He
lean
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
cover
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

heaven

in

<EOS>
the
fellow
approach
and
give
the
chair
on
which
Linton
rest
a
push

<EOS>
He
would
better
have
keep
his
distance
:
my
master
quickly
spring
erect

strike
him
full
on

throat
a
blow

would

be
with

They
have
already
enter
the
court

<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
on
the
second
thought
,
resolve
to
avoid
a
struggle
against
three
underling
:
he
seize
the
poker

smash
the
lock
from

make

escape

tramp
in

do
not

disturbance

on

thousand
smith

hammer

tell
Isabella
to
shun
me
;
this
uproar
be
owe
to
her
;
and
should
she
or
any
one
else
aggravate
my
anger
at
present
,
I
shall
get
wild
.
<EOS>
and
,
nelly
,
say
to
Edgar
,
if
you
see
him
again
to
-
night
,
that
I
be
in
danger
of
be
seriously
ill
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
may
prove
true
.
<EOS>
He
have
startle
and
distress
me
shockingly
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
frighten
him
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
may
come
and
begin
a
string
of
abuse
or
complaining
;
I
be
certain
I
should
recriminate
,
and
God
know
where
we
should
end
!
<EOS>
Will
you
do
so
,
my
good
<EOS>
nelly
?
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
I
be
no
way
blamable
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
what
possess
him
to
turn
listener
?
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
talk
be
outrageous
,
after
you
leave
us
;
but
I
could
soon
have
divert
him
from
Isabella
,
and
the
rest
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
now
all
be
dash
wrong
;
by
the
fool
's
craving
to
hear
evil
of
self
,
that
haunt
some
people
like
a
demon
!
<EOS>
have
Edgar
never
gather
our
conversation
,
he
would
never
have
be
the
bad
for
it
.
<EOS>
really
,
when
he
open
on
me
in
that
unreasonable
tone
of
displeasure
after
I
have
scold
Heathcliff
till
I
be
hoarse
for
him
,
I
do
not
care
hardly
what
they
do
to
each
other
;
especially
as
I
feel
that
,
however
the
scene
close
,
we
should
all
be
drive
asunder
for
nobody
know
how
long
!
<EOS>
well
,
if
I
can
not
keep
Heathcliff
for
my
friend
 
if
Edgar
will
be
mean
and
jealous
,
I
will
try
to
break
their
heart
by
break
my
own
.
<EOS>
that
will
be
a
prompt
way
of
finish
all
,
when
I
be
push
to
extremity
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
deed
to
be
reserve
for
a
forlorn
hope
;
I
would
not
take
Linton
by
surprise
with
it
.
<EOS>
to
this
point
he
have
be
discreet
in
dread
to
provoke
me
;
you
must
represent
the
peril
of
quit
that
policy
,
and
remind
him
of
my
passionate
temper
,
verging
,
when
kindle
,
on
frenzy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
dismiss
that
apathy
out
of
that
countenance
,
and
look
rather
more
anxious
about
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
stolidity
with
which
I
receive
these
instruction
be
,
no
doubt
,
rather
exasperate
:
for
they
be
deliver
in
perfect
sincerity
;
but
I
believe
a
person
who
could
plan
the
turning
of
her
fit
of
passion
to
account
,
beforehand
,
may
,
by
exert
her
will
,
manage
to
control
herself
tolerably
,
even
while
under
their
influence
;
and
I
do
not
wish
to
"
frighten
"
her
husband
,
as
she
say
,
and
multiply
his
annoyance
for
the
purpose
of
serve
her
selfishness
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
say
nothing
when
I
meet
the
master
come
towards
the
parlour
;
but
I
take
the
liberty
of
turn
back
to
listen
whether
they
would
resume
their
quarrel
together
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
remain
where
you
be
,
Catherine
,
"
he
say
;
without
any
anger
in
his
voice
,
but
with
much
sorrowful
despondency
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
stay
.
<EOS>
I
be
neither
come
to
wrangle
nor
be
reconcile
;
but
I
wish
just
to
learn
whether
,
after
this
evening
's
event
,
you
intend
to
continue
your
intimacy
with
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
"
interrupt
the
mistress
,
stamp
her
foot
,
"
for
mercy
's
sake
,
let
us
hear
no
more
of
it
now
!
<EOS>
Your
cold
blood
can
not
be
work
into
a
fever
:
your
vein
be
full
of
ice
-
water
;
but
mine
be
boil
,
and
the
sight
of
such
chillness
make
them
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
get
rid
of
me
,
answer
my
question
,
"
persevere
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
answer
it
;
and
that
violence
do
not
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
find
that
you
can
be
as
stoical
as
anyone
,
when
you
please
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
up
Heathcliff
hereafter
,
or
will
you
give
up
me
?
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
you
to
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
friend
and
_
<EOS>
his
_
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
;
and
I
absolutely
_
require
_
to
know
which
you
choose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
require
to
be
let
alone
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Catherine
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
demand
it
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
I
can
scarcely
stand
?
<EOS>
Edgar
,
you
 
<EOS>
you
leave
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
ring
the
bell
till
it
break
with
a
twang
;
I
enter
leisurely
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
try
the
temper
of
a
saint
,
such
senseless
,
wicked
rage
!
<EOS>
there
she
lie
dash
her
head
against
the
arm
of
the
sofa
,
and
grind
her
tooth
,
so
that
you
may
fancy
she
would
crash
them
to
splinter
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
stand
look
at
her
in
sudden
compunction
and
fear
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
to
fetch
some
water
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
breath
for
speak
.
<EOS>
I
bring
a
glass
full
;
and
as
she
would
not
drink
,
I
sprinkle
it
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
second
she
stretch
herself
out
stiff
,
and
turn
up
her
eye
,
while
her
cheek
,
at
once
blanch
and
livid
,
assume
the
aspect
of
death
.
<EOS>
Linton
look
terrified
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
,
"
I
whisper
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
him
to
yield
,
though
I
could
not
help
be
afraid
in
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
blood
on
her
lip
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
tartly
.
<EOS>
and
I
tell
him
how
she
have
resolve
,
previous
to
his
coming
,
on
exhibit
a
fit
of
frenzy
.
<EOS>
I
incautiously
give
the
account
aloud
,
and
she
hear
me
;
for
she
start
up
 
her
hair
fly
over
her
shoulder
,
her
eye
flash
,
the
muscle
of
her
neck
and
arm
stand
out
preternaturally
.
<EOS>
I
make
up
my
mind
for
broken
bone
,
at
least
;
but
she
only
glare
about
her
for
an
instant
,
and
then
rush
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
master
direct
me
to
follow
;
I
do
,
to
her
chamber
-
door
:
she
hinder
me
from
go
further
by
secure
it
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
never
offer
to
descend
to
breakfast
next
morning
,
I
go
to
ask
whether
she
would
have
some
carry
up
.
"
<EOS>
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
reply
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
the
same
question
be
repeat
at
dinner
and
tea
;
and
again
on
the
morrow
after
,
and
receive
the
same
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
,
on
his
part
,
spend
his
time
in
the
library
,
and
do
not
inquire
concern
his
wife
's
occupation
.
<EOS>
Isabella
and
he
have
have
an
hour
's
interview
,
during
which
he
try
to
elicit
from
her
some
sentiment
of
proper
horror
for
Heathcliff
's
advance
:
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
her
evasive
reply
,
and
be
oblige
to
close
the
examination
unsatisfactorily
;
add
,
however
,
a
solemn
warning
,
that
if
she
be
so
insane
as
to
encourage
that
worthless
suitor
,
it
would
dissolve
all
bond
of
relationship
between
herself
and
him
.
    
<EOS>
while
Miss
Linton
mope
about
the
park
and
garden
,
always
silent
,
and
almost
always
in
tear
;
and
her
brother
shut
himself
up
among
book
that
he
never
open
 
wearying
,
I
guess
,
with
a
continual
vague
expectation
that
Catherine
,
repent
her
conduct
,
would
come
of
her
own
accord
to
ask
pardon
,
and
seek
a
reconciliation
 
and
_
<EOS>
she
_
fast
pertinaciously
,
under
the
idea
,
probably
,
that
at
every
meal
Edgar
be
ready
to
choke
for
her
absence
,
and
pride
alone
hold
him
from
run
to
cast
himself
at
her
foot
;
I
go
about
my
household
duty
,
convince
that
the
grange
have
but
one
sensible
soul
in
its
wall
,
and
that
lodge
in
my
body
.
<EOS>
I
waste
no
condolence
on
Miss
,
nor
any
expostulation
on
my
mistress
;
nor
do
I
pay
much
attention
to
the
sigh
of
my
master
,
who
yearn
to
hear
his
lady
's
name
,
since
he
may
not
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
I
determine
they
should
come
about
as
they
please
for
me
;
and
though
it
be
a
tiresomely
slow
process
,
I
begin
to
rejoice
at
length
in
a
faint
dawn
of
its
progress
:
as
I
think
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
,
on
the
third
day
,
unbar
her
door
,
and
have
finish
the
water
in
her
pitcher
and
decanter
,
desire
a
renew
supply
,
and
a
basin
of
gruel
,
for
she
believe
she
be
die
.
<EOS>
that
I
set
down
as
a
speech
mean
for
Edgar
's
ear
;
I
believe
no
such
thing
,
so
I
keep
it
to
myself
and
bring
her
some
tea
and
dry
toast
.
<EOS>
She
eat
and
drink
eagerly
,
and
sink
back
on
her
pillow
again
,
clench
her
hand
and
groaning
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
die
,
"
she
exclaim
,
"
since
no
one
care
anything
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
not
take
that
.
"
<EOS>
then
a
good
while
after
I
hear
her
murmur
,
"
no
,
I
will
not
die
 
<EOS>
he
would
be
glad
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
love
me
at
all
 
<EOS>
he
would
never
miss
me
!

the

her
former
illness

only
that
brief

water

temper

remember
be
in

parlour
after

have
quarrel
,
and
Edgar
be
cruelly
provoking

me
run
into
this
room
desperate

<EOS>
as
soon
as
ever
I
have
bar
the
door
,
utter
blackness
overwhelm
me
,
and
I
fall
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
explain
to
Edgar
<EOS>
how
certain
I
feel
of
have
a
fit
,
or
go
rage
mad
,
if
he
persist
in
tease
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
command
of
tongue
,
or
brain
,
and
he
do
not
guess
my
agony
,
perhaps
<EOS>
:
it
barely
leave
me
sense
to
try
to
escape
from
him

his
voice

before
I
recover
sufficiently
to
see
and
hear
,
it
begin
to
be
dawn
,
and
,
nelly
,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
think
,
and
what
have
keep
recur
and
recur
till
I
fear
for
my
reason
.
<EOS>
I
think
as
I
lie
there
,
with
my
head
against
that
table
leg
,
and
my
eye
dimly
discern
the
grey
square
of
the
window
,
that
I
be
enclose
in
the
oak
-
panel
bed
at
home
;
and
my
heart
ache
with
some
great
grief
which
,
just
wake
,
I
could
not
recollect
.
<EOS>
I
ponder
,
and
worry
myself
to
discover
what
it
could
be
,
and
,
most
strangely
,
the
whole
last
seven
year
of
my
life
grow
a
blank
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
recall
that
they
have
be
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
child
;
my
father
be
just
bury
,
and
my
misery
arise
from
the
separation
that
Hindley
have
order
between
me
and
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
be
lay
alone
,
for
the
first
time
;
and
,
rouse
from
a
dismal
doze
after
a
night
of
weeping
,
I
lift
my
hand
to
push
the
panel
aside
:
it
strike
the
table
-
top
!
<EOS>
I
sweep
it
along
the
carpet
,
and
then
memory
burst
in
:
<EOS>
my
late
anguish
be
swallow
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
why
I
feel
so
wildly
wretched
:
it
must
have
be
temporary
derangement
;
for
there
be
scarcely
cause
.
<EOS>
but
,
suppose
at
twelve
year
old
I
have
be
wrench
from
the
Heights
,
and
every
early
association
,
and
my
all
in
all
,
as
Heathcliff
be
at
that
time
,
and
be
convert
at
a
stroke
into
Mrs.
Linton
,
the
lady
of
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
the
wife
of
a
stranger

an
exile
,
and
outcast

thenceforth

from
what
have
be
my
world

You
may
fancy
a
glimpse
of
the
abyss
where

your

unsettle
me

You
should
have
speak
to
Edgar
,
indeed
you
should
,
and
compel
him
to
leave
me
quiet
!
<EOS>
oh
,
I
be
burn
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
out
of
door
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
a
girl
again
,
half
savage
and
hardy
,
and
free
;
and
laugh
at
injury
,
not
madden
under
them
!
<EOS>
why
be
I
so
changed
?
<EOS>
why
do
my
blood
rush
into
a
hell
of
tumult
at
a
few
word
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
should
be
myself
be
I
once
among
the
heather
on
those
hill
.
<EOS>
open
the
window
again
wide
:
fasten
it
open
!
<EOS>
quick
,
why
do
not
you
move
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
will
not
give
you
your
death
of
cold
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
give
me
a
chance
of
life
,
you
mean
,
"
she
say
,
sullenly
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
not
helpless
yet
;
I
will
open
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
slide
from
the
bed
before
I
could
hinder
her
,
she
cross
the
room
,
walk
very
uncertainly
,
throw
it
back
,
and
bend
out
,
careless
of
the
frosty
air
that
cut
about
her
shoulder
as
keen
as
a
knife
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
,
and
finally
attempt
to
force
her
to
retire
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
her
delirious
strength
much
surpassed
mine
<EOS>
(
she
be
delirious
,
I
become
convinced
by
her
subsequent
action
and
raving
)
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
moon
,
and
everything
beneath
lie
in
misty
darkness
:
not
a
light
gleam
from
any
house
,
far
or
near
all
have
be
extinguish
long
ago
:
and
those
at
Wuthering
Heights
be
never
visible
 
<EOS>
still
she
assert
she
catch
their
shining
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
eagerly
,
"
that
be
my
room
with
the
candle
in
it
,
and
the
tree
sway
before
it
;
and
the
other
candle
be
in
Joseph
's
garret
.
<EOS>
Joseph
sit
up
late
,
do
not
he
?
<EOS>
He
be
wait
till
I
come
home
that
he
may
lock
the
gate
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
will
wait
a
while
yet
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rough
journey
,
and
a
sad
heart
to
travel
it
;
and
we
must
pass
by
Gimmerton
Kirk
to
go
that
journey
!
<EOS>
We
have
brave
its
ghost
often
together
,
and
dare
each
other
to
stand
among
the
grave
and
ask
them
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
,
Heathcliff
,
if
I
dare
you
now

will
you
venture
?
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
I
will
keep
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
lie
there
by
myself

they
may
bury
me
twelve
foot
deep
,
and
throw
the
church
down
over
me
,
but
I
will
not
rest
till
you
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
never

<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
resume
with
a
strange
smile
.

He
be

rather

slow
!

content

you
always
follow
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
perceive
it
vain
to
argue
against
her
insanity
,
I
be
plan
how
I
could
reach
something
to
wrap
about
her
,
without
quit
my
hold
of
herself
(
for
I
could
not
trust
her
alone
by
the
gape
lattice
)
,
when
,
to
my
consternation
,
I
hear
the
rattle
of
the
door
-
handle
,
and
Mr.
Linton
enter
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
then
come
from
the
library
;
and
,
in
pass
through
the
lobby
,
have
notice
our
talking
and
be
attract
by
curiosity
,
or
fear
,
to
examine
what
it
signify
,
at
that
late
hour

<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
check
the
exclamation
rise
to
his
lip
at
the
sight
which
meet
him
,
and
the
bleak
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
.

"
My
poor
mistress
be
ill
,

she
quite
master
me
:
I
can
not

her
at
all

pray
,
come
and
persuade
her
to
go
to
bed

your

hard

He
be
silent
.
<EOS>
the
haggardness
of
Mrs.
Linton
's
appearance
smote
him
speechless
,
and
he
could
only
glance
from
her
to
me
in
horrified
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
be
fret
here
,

I
continue
,
"
and
eat
scarcely
anything
,
and
never
complain
:
she
would
admit
none
of
us
till
this
evening
,
and
so
we
could
not
inform
you
of
her
state
,
as
we
be
not
aware
of
it
ourselves
;
but
it
be
nothing
.

"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
I
utter
my
explanation
awkwardly
;
the
master
frown
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
nothing
,
be
it
,
Ellen
Dean

he
say
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
account
more
clearly
for

me
ignorant
of
this

<EOS>
and
he
take
his
wife
in
his
arm
,
and
look
at
her
with
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
she
give
him
no
glance
of
recognition
:
he
be
invisible
to
her
abstracted
gaze
.
<EOS>
the
delirium
be
not
fix
,
however
;
have
wean
her
eye
from
contemplate
the
outer
darkness
,
by
degree
she
centre
her
attention
on
him
,
and
discover
who
it

hold
her

"

be
come

with
angry
animation

I
suppose
we
shall
have
plenty
of
lamentation
now

I
see
we

they
can
not

under

month
of
sickness

<EOS>
I
begin
to
defend
myself
,
think
it
too
bad
to
be
blame
for
another
's
wicked
waywardness

<EOS>
"
I
know
Mrs.
Linton
's
nature

be
headstrong

domineering

cry
I
:
"

I
do
not

fierce
temper

I.

your
permission

come
a

courting
to

in
at
every
opportunity

poison
the

<EOS>
confuse
as
Catherine
be
,
her
wit
be
alert
at
apply
our
conversation
.
  
<EOS>

ah
!

to

us

let
me
go
,
and
I
will
make
her
rue
!
<EOS>
I
will
make
her
howl
a
recantation
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
maniac
's
fury
kindle
under
her
brow
;
she
struggle
desperately
to
disengage
herself
from
Linton
's
arm
.
<EOS>
I
feel
no
inclination
to
tarry
the
event
;
and
,
resolve
to
seek
medical
aid
on
my
own
responsibility
,
I
quit
the
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
in
pass
the
garden
to
reach
the
road
,
at
a
place
where
a
bridle
hook
be
drive
into
the
wall
,
I
see
something
white
move
irregularly
,
evidently
by
another
agent
than
the
wind
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
hurry
,
I
stay
to
examine
it
,
lest
ever
after
I
should
have
the
conviction
impress
on
my
imagination
that
it
be
a
creature
of
the
other
world
.
<EOS>
My
surprise
and
perplexity
be
great
on
discovering
,
by
touch
more
than
vision
,
Miss
Isabella
's
springer
,
Fanny
,
suspend
by
a
handkerchief
,
and
nearly
at
its
last
gasp
.
<EOS>
I
quickly
release
the
animal
,
and
lift
it
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
follow
its
mistress
up
-
stair
when
she
go
to
bed
;
and
wonder
much
how
it
could
have
get
out
there
,
and
what
mischievous
person
have
treat
it
so
.
<EOS>
while
untie
the
knot
round
the
hook
,
it
seem
to
me
that
I
repeatedly
catch
the
beat
of
horse
'
foot
gallop
at
some
distance
;
but
there
be
such
a
number
of
thing
to
occupy
my
reflection
that
I
hardly
give
the
circumstance
a
thought
:
though
it
be
a
strange
sound
,
in
that
place
,
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
be
fortunately
just
issue
from
his
house
to
see
a
patient
in
the
village
as
I
come
up
the
street
;
and
my
account
of
Catherine
Linton
's
malady
induce
him
to
accompany
me
back
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
plain
rough
man
;
and
he
make
no
scruple
to
speak
his
doubt
of
her
survive
this
second
attack
;
unless
she
be
more
submissive
to
his
direction
than
she
have
show
herself
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
nelly
Dean
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
not
help
fancy
there
be
an
extra
cause
for
this
.
<EOS>
what
have
there
be
to
do
at
the
grange
?
<EOS>
We
have
odd
report
up
here
.
<EOS>
a
stout
,
hearty
lass
like
Catherine
do
not
fall
ill
for
a
trifle
;
and
that
sort
of
people
should
not
either
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
work
bring
them
through
fever
,
and
such
thing
.
<EOS>
how
do
it
begin
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
master
will
inform
you
,
"
I
answer
;
"
but
you
be
acquaint
with
the
Earnshaws
'
violent
disposition
,
and
Mrs.
Linton
cap
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
may
say
this
;
it
commence
in
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
She
be
strike
during
a
tempest
of
passion
with
a
kind
of
fit
.
<EOS>
that
be
her
account
,
at
least
:
for
she
fly
off
in
the
height
of
it
,
and
lock
herself
up
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
she
refuse
to
eat
,
and
now
she
alternately
rave
and
remain
in
a
half
dream
;
know
those
about
her
,
but
have
her
mind
fill
with
all
sort
of
strange
idea
and
illusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Linton
will
be
sorry
?
"
observe
Kenneth
,
interrogatively
.
  
<EOS>
"
sorry
?
<EOS>
he
will
break
his
heart
<EOS>
should
anything
happen
!
<EOS>
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
alarm
him
more
than
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
tell
him
to
beware
,
"
say
my
companion
;
"
and
he
must
bide
the
consequence
of
neglect
my
warning
!
<EOS>
have
not
he
be
intimate
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
frequently
visit
at
the
Grange
,
"
answer
I
,
"
though
more
on
the
strength
of
the
mistress
have
know
him
when
a
boy
,
than
because
the
master
like
his
company
.
<EOS>
at
present
he
be
discharge
from
the
trouble
of
call
;
owe
to
some
presumptuous
aspiration
after
Miss
Linton
which
he
manifest
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
think
he
will
be
take
in
again
.

<EOS>
"
and
do
Miss
Linton
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
him

be
the
doctor
's
next
question

<EOS>
"
I
be
not
in
her
confidence

return
I
,
reluctant
to
continue
the
subject
.

no

sly
one

he
remark
,
shake
his
head
.

<EOS>
She
keep
her
own
counsel
!
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
real
little
fool

<EOS>
I
have
it
from
good
authority
that
last
night
(
and
a
pretty
night
it
be
!
)
<EOS>
she
and
Heathcliff
be

in
the
plantation
at
the
back
of
your
house
above
two
hour
;
and
he
press
her
not
to
go
in
again
,
but
just
mount
his
horse
and
away
with
him
!
<EOS>
My
informant
say
she
could
only
put
him
off
by
pledge
her
word
of
honour
to
be
prepare
on
their
first
meeting
after
that
:
when
it

do
not
hear
;
but
you
urge
Mr.
Linton
to
look
sharp
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
news
fill
me
with
fresh
fear
;
I
outstrip
Kenneth
,
and
run
most
of
the
way
back
.
<EOS>
the
little
dog
be
yelp
in
the
garden
yet
.
<EOS>
I
spare
a
minute
to
open
the
gate
for
it
,
but
instead
of
go
to
the
house
door
,
it
course
up
and
down
snuff
the
grass
,
and
would
have
escape
to
the
road
,
have
I
not
seize
it
and
convey
it
in
with
me
.
<EOS>
on
ascend
to
Isabella
's
room
,
my
suspicion
be
confirm
:
it
be
empty
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
a
few
hour
sooner
Mrs.
Linton
's
illness
may
have
arrest
her
rash
step
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
be
do
now
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
bare
possibility
of
overtake
them
if
pursue
instantly
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
could
not
pursue
them
,
however
;
and
I
dare
not
rouse
the
family
,
and
fill
the
place
with
confusion
;
still
less
unfold
the
business
to
my
master
,
absorb
as
he
be
in
his
present
calamity
,
and
have
no
heart
to
spare
for
a
second
grief
!
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
hold
my
tongue
,
and
suffer
matter
to
take
their
course
;
and
Kenneth
be
arrive
,
I
go
with
a
badly
compose
countenance
to
announce
him
.
<EOS>
Catherine
lie
in
a
troubled
sleep
<EOS>
:
her
husband
have
succeed
in
soothe
the
excess
of
frenzy
;
he
now
hang
over
her
pillow
,
watch
every
shade
and
every
change
of
her
painfully
expressive
feature
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
examine
the
case
for
himself
,
speak
hopefully
to
him
of
its
have
a
favourable
termination
,
if
we
could
only
preserve
around
her
perfect
and
constant
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
he
signify
the
threatening
danger
be
not
so
much
death
,
as
permanent
alienation
of
intellect
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
close
my
eye
that
night
,
nor
do
Mr.
Linton
:
indeed
,
we
never
go
to
bed
;
and
the
servant
be
all
up
long
before
the
usual
hour
,
move
through
the
house
with
stealthy
tread
,
and
exchange
whisper
as
they
encounter
each
other
in
their
vocation
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
active
but
Miss
Isabella
;
and
they
begin
to
remark
how
sound
she
sleep
:
<EOS>
her
brother
,
too
,
ask
if
she
have
rise
,
and
seem
impatient
for
her
presence
,
and
hurt
that
she
show
so
little
anxiety
for
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
tremble
lest
he
should
send
me
to
call
her
;
but
I
be
spare
the
pain
of
be
the
first
proclaimant
of
her
flight
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
maid
,
a
thoughtless
girl
,
who
have
be
on
an
early
errand
to
Gimmerton
,
come
pant
up
-
stair
,
open
-
mouthed
,
and
dash
into
the
chamber
,
cry
:
"
oh
,
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
what
mun
we
have
next
?
<EOS>
Master
,
master
,
our
young
lady
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
hold
your
noise
!
"
<EOS>
cry
,
I
hastily
,
enrage
at
her
clamorous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
speak
lower
,
Mary
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
say
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
what
ail
your
young
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
go
,
she
be
go
!
<EOS>
Yon
'
Heathcliff
's
run
off
wi
'
her
!
"
<EOS>
gasp
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
true
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Linton
,
rise
in
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
:
how
have
the
idea
enter
your
head
?
<EOS>
Ellen
Dean
,
go
and
seek
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
incredible
:
it
can
not
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
speak
he
take
the
servant
to
the
door
,
and
then
repeat
his
demand
to
know
her
reason
for
such
an
assertion
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
meet
on
the
road
a
lad
that
fetch
milk
here
,
"
she
stammer
,
"
and
he
ask
whether
we
be
not
in
trouble
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
mean
for
missis
's
sickness
,
so
I
answer
,
yes
.
<EOS>
then
say
he
,
"
there
be
somebody
go
after
'em
,
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
I
stare
.
<EOS>
He
see
I
know
nought
about
it
,
and
he
tell
how
a
gentleman
and
lady
have
stop
to
have
a
horse
's
shoe
fasten
at
a
blacksmith
's
shop
,
two
mile
out
of
Gimmerton
,
not
very
long
after
midnight
!
<EOS>
and
how
the
blacksmith
's
lass
have
get
up
to
spy
who
they
be
:
she
know
them
both
directly
.
<EOS>
and
she
notice
the
man
 
Heathcliff
<EOS>
it
be
,
she
feel
certain
:
nob'dy
could
mistake
him
,
besides
 
put
a
sovereign
in
her
father
's
hand
for
payment
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
a
cloak
about
her
face
;
but
have
desire
a
sup
of
water
,
while
she
drink
it
fall
back
,
and
she
see
her
very
plain
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
hold
both
bridle
as
they
ride
on
,
and
they
set
their
face
from
the
village
,
and
go
as
fast
as
the
rough
road
would
let
them
.
<EOS>
the
lass
say
nothing
to
her
father
,
but
she
tell
it
all
over
Gimmerton
this
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
run
and
peep
,
for
form
's
sake
,
into
Isabella
's
room
;
confirming
,
when
I
return
,
the
servant
's
statement
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
have
resume
his
seat
by
the
bed
;
on
my
re
-
entrance
,
he
raise
his
eye
,
read
the
meaning
of
my
blank
aspect
,
and
drop
them
without
give
an
order
,
or
utter
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
we
to
try
any
measure
for
overtake
and
bring
her
back
,
"
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
how
should
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
go
of
her
own
accord
,
"
answer
the
master
;
"
she
have
a
right
to
go
if
she
please
.
<EOS>
trouble
me
no
more
about
her
.
<EOS>
hereafter
she
be
only
my
sister
in
name
:
not
because
I
disown
her
,
but
because
she
have
disown
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
he
say
on
the
subject
<EOS>
:
he
do
not
make
single
inquiry
further
,
or
mention
her
in
any
way
,
except
direct
me
to
send
what
property
she
have
in
the
house
to
her
fresh
home
,
wherever
it
be
,
when
I
know
it
.
    
<EOS>
for
two
month
the
fugitive
remain
absent
;
in
those
two
month
,
Mrs.
Linton
encounter
and
conquer
the
bad
shock
of
what
be
denominate
a
brain
fever
.
<EOS>
no
mother
could
have
nurse
an
only
child
more
devotedly
than
Edgar
tend
her
.
<EOS>
day
and
night
he
be
watch
,
and
patiently
endure
all
the
annoyance
that
irritable
nerve
and
a
shake
reason
could
inflict
;
and
,
though
Kenneth
remark
that
what
he
save
from
the
grave
would
only
recompense
his
care
by
form
the
source
of
constant
future
anxiety
 
in
fact
,
that
his
health
and
strength
be
be
sacrifice
to
preserve
a
mere
ruin
of
humanity
 
he
know
no
limit
in
gratitude
and
joy
when
Catherine
's
life
be
declare
out
of
danger
;
and
hour
after
hour
he
would
sit
beside
her
,
trace
the
gradual
return
to
bodily
health
,
and
flatter
his
too
sanguine
hope
with
the
illusion
that
her
mind
would
settle
back
to
its
right
balance
also
,
and
she
would
soon
be
entirely
her
former
self
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
time
she
leave
her
chamber
be
at
the
commencement
of
the
follow
March
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
have
put
on
her
pillow
,
in
the
morning
,
a
handful
of
golden
crocus
;
her
eye
,
long
stranger
to
any
gleam
of
pleasure
,
catch
them
in
wake
,
and
shone
delighted
as
she
gather
them
eagerly
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
early
flower
at
the
Heights
,
"
she
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
They
remind
me
of
soft
thaw
wind
,
and
warm
sunshine
,
and
nearly
melt
snow
.
<EOS>
Edgar
,
be
there
not
a
south
wind
,
and
be
not
the
snow
almost
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
snow
be
quite
go
down
here
,
darling
,
"
reply
her
husband
;
"
and
I
only
see
two
white
spot
on
the
whole
range
of
moor
:
the
sky
be
blue
,
and
the
lark
be
singe
,
and
the
beck
and
brooks
be
all
brim
full
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
last
spring
at
this
time
,
I
be
long
to
have
you
under
this
roof
;
now
,
I
wish
you
be
a
mile
or
two
up
those
hill
<EOS>
:
the
air
blow
so
sweetly
,
I
feel
that
it
would
cure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
there
<EOS>
but
once
more
,
"
say
the
invalid
;
"
and
then
you
will
leave
me
,
and
I
shall
remain
for
ever
.
<EOS>
next
spring
you
will
long
again
to
have
me
under
this
roof
,
and
you
will
look
back
and
think
you
be
happy
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
lavish
on
her
the
kind
caress
,
and
try
to
cheer
her
by
the
fond
word
;
but
,
vaguely
regard
the
flower
,
she
let
the
tear
collect
on
her
lash
and
stream
down
her
cheek
unheede
.
<EOS>
We
know
she
be
really
well
,
and
,
therefore
,
decide
that
long
confinement
to
a
single
place
produce
much
of
this
despondency
,
and
it
may
be
partially
remove
by
a
change
of
scene
.
<EOS>
the
master
tell
me
to
light
a
fire
in
the
many
-
week
'
deserted
parlour
,
and
to
set
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
sunshine
by
the
window
;
and
then
he
bring
her
down
,
and
she
sit
a
long
while
enjoy
the
genial
heat
,
and
,
as
we
expect
,
revive
by
the
object
<EOS>
round
her
:
<EOS>
which
,
though
familiar
,
be
free
from
the
dreary
association
invest
her
hated
sick
chamber
.
<EOS>
by
evening
she
seem
greatly
exhausted
;
yet
no
argument
could
persuade
her
to
return
to
that
apartment
,
and
I
have
to
arrange
the
parlour
sofa
for
her
bed
,
till
another
room
could
be
prepare
.
<EOS>
to
obviate
the
fatigue
of
mount
and
descend
the
stair
,
we
fit
up
this
,
where
you
lie
at
present
 
on
the
same
floor
with
the
parlour
;
and
she
be
soon
strong
enough
to
move
from
one
to
the
other
,
lean
on
Edgar
's
arm
.
<EOS>
ah
,
I
think
myself
,
she
may
recover
,
so
wait
on
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
double
cause
to
desire
it
,
for
on
her
existence
depend
that
of
another
:
we
cherish
the
hope
that
in
a
little
while
Mr.
Linton
's
heart
would
be
gladden
,
and
his
land
secure
from
a
stranger
's
gripe
,
by
the
birth
of
an
heir
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
mention
that
Isabella
send
to
her
brother
,
some
six
week
from
her
departure
,
a
short
note
,
announce
her
marriage
with
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
It
appear
dry
and
cold
;
but
at
the
bottom
be
dot
in
with
pencil
an
obscure
apology
,
and
an
entreaty
for
kind
remembrance
and
reconciliation
,
if
her
proceeding
have
offend
him
:
assert
that
she
could
not
help
it
then
,
and
be
do
,
she
have
now
no
power
to
repeal
it
.
<EOS>
Linton
do
not
reply
to
this
,
I
believe
;
and
,
in
a
fortnight
more
,
I
get
a
long
letter
,
which
I
consider
odd
,
come
from
the
pen
of
a
bride
just
out
of
the
honeymoon
.
<EOS>
I
will
read
it
:
for
I
keep
it
yet
.
<EOS>
any
relic
of
the
dead
be
precious
,
if
they
be
value
live
.
     
<EOS>
DEAR
ELLEN
,
it
begin
,
 
<EOS>
I
come
last
night
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
hear
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
Catherine
have
be
,
and
be
yet
,
very
ill
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
write
to
her
,
I
suppose
,
and
my
brother
be
either
too
angry
or
too
distressed
to
answer
what
I
send
him
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
must
write
to
somebody
,
and
the
only
choice
leave
me
be
you
.
  
<EOS>
Inform
Edgar
that
I
would
give
the
world
to
see
his
face
again
 
that
my
heart
return
to
Thrushcross
Grange
in
twenty
-
four
hour
after
I
leave
it
,
and
be
there
at
this
moment
,
full
of
warm
feeling
for
him
,
and
Catherine
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
can
not
follow
it
though
_
 
<EOS>
(
these
word
be
underline
)
 
<EOS>
they
nee
not
expect
me
,
and
they
may
draw
what
conclusion
they
please
;
take
care
,
however
,
to
lay
nothing
at
the
door
of
my
weak
will
or
deficient
affection
.
  
<EOS>
the
remainder
of
the
letter
be
for
yourself
alone
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
you
two
question
:
the
first
be
,
 
how
do
you
contrive
to
preserve
the
common
sympathy
of
human
nature
when
you
reside
here
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
recognise
any
sentiment
which
those
around
share
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
question
I
have
great
interest
in
<EOS>
;
it
be
this
 
be
Mr.
Heathcliff
a
man
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
be
he
mad
?
<EOS>
and
if
not
,
be
he
a
devil
?
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
tell
my
reason
for
make
this
inquiry
;
but
I
beseech
you
to
explain
,
if
you
can
,
what
I
have
marry
:
that
is
,
when
you
call
to
see
me
;
and
you
must
call
,
Ellen
,
very
soon
.
<EOS>
do
not
write
,
but
come
,
and
bring
me
something
from
Edgar
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
you
shall
hear
how
I
have
be
receive
in
my
new
home
,
as
I
be
lead
to
imagine
the
Heights
will
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
amuse
myself
that
I
dwell
on
such
subject
as
the
lack
of
external
comfort
:
they
never
occupy
my
thought
,
except
at
the
moment
when
I
miss
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
laugh
and
dance
for
joy
,
if
I
find
their
absence
be
the
total
of
my
misery
,
and
the
rest
be
an
unnatural
dream
!
  
<EOS>
the
sun
set
behind
the
grange
as
we
turn
on
to
the
moor
;
by
that
,
I
judge
it
to
be
six
o'clock
;
and
my
companion
halt
half
an
hour
,
to
inspect
the
park
,
and
the
gardens
,
and
,
probably
,
the
place
itself
,
as
well
as
he
could
;
so
it
be
dark
when
we
dismount
in
the
paved
yard
of
the
farm
-
house
,
and
your
old
fellow
-
servant
,
Joseph
,
issue
out
to
receive
us
by
the
light
of
a
dip
candle
.
<EOS>
He
do
it
with
a
courtesy
that
redound
to
his
credit
.
<EOS>
His
first
act
be

elevate
his
torch
to
a
level
with
my
face
,
squint
malignantly
,
project
his
under
-
lip
,
and
turn
away
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
the
two
horse
,
and
lead
them
into
the
stable
;
reappear
for
the
purpose
of
lock
the
outer
gate
,
as
if
we
live
in
an
ancient
castle
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
stay
to
speak
to
him
,
and
I
enter
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
a
dingy
,
untidy
hole
<EOS>
;
I
daresay
you
would
not
know
it
,
it
be
so
change
since
it
be
in
your
charge
.
<EOS>
by
the
fire
stand
a
ruffianly
child
,
strong
in
limb
and
dirty
in
garb
,
with
a
look
of
Catherine
in
his
eye
and
about
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
Edgar
's
legal
nephew
,
"
I
reflect
 
"
mine
in
a
manner
;
I
must
shake
hand
,
and
 
yes
 
I
must
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
right
to
establish
a
good
understanding
at
the
beginning
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
approach
,
and
,
attempt
to
take
his
chubby
fist
,
say
 
"
how
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
reply
in
a
jargon
I
do
not
comprehend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
and
I
be
friend
,
Hareton
?
<EOS>
"
be
my
next
essay
at
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
an
oath
,
and
a
threat
to
set
Throttler
on
me
if
I
do
not
"
frame
off
"
reward
my
perseverance
.
  
<EOS>
"
hey
,
Throttler
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
the
little
wretch
,
rouse
a
half
-
breed
bull
-
dog
from
its
lair
in
a
corner
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
wilt
thou
be
gang
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
authoritatively
.
  
<EOS>
love
for
my
life
urge
a
compliance
;
I
step
over
the
threshold
to
wait
till
the
other
should
enter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
nowhere
visible
;
and
Joseph
,
whom
I
follow
to
the
stable
,
and
request
to
accompany
me
in
,
after
stare
and
muttering
to
himself
,
screw
up
his
nose
and
reply
 
"
Mim

I
cry

deaf

highly

at

he
answer
,
and
continue
his
work
;
move
his
lantern
jaw
meanwhile
,
and
survey
my
dress
and
countenance
(
the
former
a
great
deal
too
fine
,
but
the
latter
,
I
be
sure
,
as
sad
as
he
could
desire
)
with
sovereign
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
round
the
yard
,
and
through
a
wicket
,
to
another
door
,
at
which
I
take
the
liberty
of
knock
,
<EOS>
in
hope
some
more
civil
servant
may
show
himself
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
suspense
,
it
be
open
by
a
tall
,
gaunt
man
,
without
neckerchief
,
and
otherwise
extremely
slovenly
;
his
feature
be
lose
in
masse
of
shaggy
hair
that
hang
on
his
shoulder
;
and
_
his
_
eye
,
too
,
be
like
a
ghostly
Catherine
's
with
all
their
beauty
annihilate
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
business
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
demand
,
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
be
Isabella
Linton
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
see
me
before
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
be
lately
married
to
Mr.
Heathcliff

and
he
have
bring
me
here
 
<EOS>
I

,
by
your
permission

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
come

then

ask
the
hermit
,
glare
like
a
hungry
wolf
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
we
come
just
now
,
"
I
say
;
"
but
he
leave
me
by
the
kitchen
door
;
and
when
I
would
have
go
in
,
your
little
boy
play
sentinel
over
the
place
,
and
frighten
me
off
by
the
help
of
a
bull
-
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
<EOS>
the
hellish
villain
have
keep
his
word
!
"
<EOS>
growl
my
future
host
,
search
the
darkness
beyond
me
in
expectation
of
discover
Heathcliff
;
and
then
he
indulge
in
a
soliloquy
of
execration
,
and
threat
of
what
he
would
have
do
have
the
"
fiend
"
deceive
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
repent
have
try
this
second
entrance
,
and
be
almost
inclined
to
slip
away
before
he
finish
curse
,
but
ere
<EOS>
I
could
execute
that
intention
,
he
order
me
in
,
and
shut
and
re
-
fasten
the
door
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
fire
,
and
that
be
all
the
light
in
the
huge
apartment
,
whose
floor
have
grow
a
uniform
grey
;
and
the
once
brilliant
pewter
-
dish
,
which
use
to
attract
my
gaze
when
I
be
a
girl
,
partook
of
a
similar
obscurity
,
create
by
tarnish
and
dust
.
<EOS>
I
inquire
whether
I
may
call
the
maid
,
and
be
conduct
to
a
bedroom
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
vouchsafe
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
walk
up
and
down
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
apparently
quite
forget
my
presence
;
and
his
abstraction
be
evidently
so
deep
,
and
his
whole
aspect
so
misanthropical
,
that
I
shrink
from
disturb
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
surprised
,
Ellen
,
at
my
feeling
particularly
cheerless
,
seat
in
bad
than
solitude
on
that
inhospitable
hearth
,
and
remember
that
four
mile
distant
lie
my
delightful
home
,
contain
the
only
people
I
love
on
earth
;
and
there
may
as
well
be
the
Atlantic
to
part
us
,
instead
of
those
four
mile
<EOS>
:
I
could
not
overpass
them
!
<EOS>
I
question
with
myself
 
where
must
I
turn
for
comfort
?
<EOS>
and
 
mind
you
do
not
tell
Edgar
,
or
Catherine
 
above
every
sorrow
beside
,
this
rise
pre
-
eminent
:
despair
at
find
nobody
who
could
or
would
be
my
ally
against
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
I
have
seek
shelter
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
almost
gladly
,
because
I
be
secure
by
that
arrangement
from
live
alone
with
him
;
but
he
know
the
people
we
be
come
amongst
,
and
he
do
not
fear
their
intermeddling
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
and
think
a
doleful
time
:
the
clock
strike
eight
,
and
nine
,
and
still
my
companion
pace
to
and
fro
,
his
head
bent
on
his
breast
,
and
perfectly
silent
,
unless
a
groan
or
a
bitter
ejaculation
force
itself
out
at
interval
.
<EOS>
I
listen
to
detect
a
woman
's
voice
in
the
house
,
and
fill
the
interim
with
wild
regret
and
dismal
anticipation
,
which
,
at
last
,
speak
audibly
in
irrepressible
sighing
and
weeping
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
how
openly
I
grieve
,
till
Earnshaw
halt
opposite
,
in
his
measured
walk
,
and
give
me
a
stare
of
newly
-
awaken
surprise
.
<EOS>
take
advantage
of
his
recovered
attention
,
I
exclaim
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
tired
with
my
journey
,
and
I
want
to
go
to
bed
!
<EOS>
where
be
the
maid

servant
?
<EOS>
direct
me
to
her
,
as
she
will
not
come
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
none
,
"
he
answer
;
"
you
must
wait
on
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
must
I
sleep
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
sob
;
I
be
beyond
regard
self
-
respect
,
weigh
down
by
fatigue
and
wretchedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
will
show
you
Heathcliff
's
chamber
,
"
say
he
;
"
open
that
door
 
<EOS>
he
be
in
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
obey
,
but
he
suddenly
arrest
me
,
and
add
in
the
strange
tone
 
<EOS>
"
be
so
good
as
to
turn
your
lock
,
and
draw
your
bolt
 
do
not
omit
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
why
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
?
"
I
do
not
relish
the
notion
of
deliberately
fasten
myself
in
with
Heathcliff
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
,
pull
from
his
waistcoat
a
curiously
-
construct
pistol
,
have
a
double
-
edge
spring
knife
attach
to
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
great
tempter
to
a
desperate
man
,
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
resist
go
up
with
this
every
night
,
and
try
his
door
.
<EOS>
if
once
I
find
it
open
<EOS>
he
be
do
for
<EOS>
;
I
do
it
invariably
,
even
though
the
minute
before
I
have
be
recall
a
hundred
reason
that
should
make
me
refrain
:
it
be
some
devil
that
urge
me
to
thwart
my
own
scheme
by
kill
him
.
<EOS>
You
fight
against
that
devil
for
love
as
long
as
you
may
;
when
the
time
come
,
not
all
the
angel
in
heaven
shall
save
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
survey
the
weapon
inquisitively
.
<EOS>
a
hideous
notion
strike
me
:
how
powerful
I
should
be
possess
such
an
instrument
!
<EOS>
I
take
it
from
his
hand
,
and
touch
the
blade
.
<EOS>
He
look
astonished
at
the
expression
my
face
assume
during
a
brief
second
:
it
be
not
horror
,
it
be
covetousness
.
<EOS>
He
snatch
the
pistol
back
,
jealously
;
shut
the
knife
,
and
return
it
to
its
concealment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
if
you
tell
him
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
put
him
on
his
guard
,
and
watch
for
him

<EOS>
You
know
the
term
we
be
on

,
I
see
:
his
danger
do
not

you

<EOS>
"
what
have
Heathcliff
do
to
you

<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
"
<EOS>
in
what
have
he
wrong
you

this
appalling
hatred

Would
not

him
quit

<EOS>

no

thunder
Earnshaw
;

<EOS>
should
he
offer
to
leave
me

dead
man

persuade
him
to

it

you
be

murderess

then
his

hell

have
his

ten

blacker
with

<EOS>
You
have
acquaint
me
,
Ellen
,
with
your
old
master
's
habit

<EOS>
He
be
clearly
on
the
verge
of
madness
:
he
be
so
last
night
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
shudder
to
be
near
him
,
and
think
on
the
servant

ill
-
breed
moroseness
as
comparatively
agreeable
.
<EOS>
He
now
recommence
his
moody
walk
,

I
raise
the
latch
,
and
escape
into
the
kitchen

Joseph

bend
over

fire

peer
into
a

pan

swing
above
it

of
oatmeal

on

settle

the
content
of
the
pan
begin
to
boil
,

he
turn
to
plunge
his
hand
into
the
bowl
;
I
conjecture
that
this
preparation
be
probably
for
our
supper
,
and
,
be
hungry

,
I
resolve
it
should
be
eatable
;
so
,
cry
out
sharply

I
remove
the

out

off

<EOS>
It

rather
a
rough
mess

I
own

when
pour
into
the
basin

four
have
be
provide
,
and
a
gallon
pitcher
of
new
milk
be
bring
from
the
dairy

which
Hareton
seize

commence
drinking
and
spill
from
the
expansive
lip

<EOS>
I
expostulate
,
and
desire
that
he
should
have
his
in
a
mug
;
affirm
that
I
could
not
taste
the
liquid
treat
so
dirtily
.
<EOS>
the
old
cynic
choose
to
be
vastly
offend
at

nicety

assure
me
,
repeatedly
,
that
"
the
barn
be
every

good

as
I
,

and
every
bit

wollsome

wonder
how
I
could
fashion
to
be
so
conceited
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
infant
ruffian
continue
suck
;
and
glower
up
at
me
defyingly

as
he
slaver
into
the
jug

He
make
no

to
this
adjuration

only
plod
doggedly
down
the
wooden
step

and
halt

before
an
apartment
which
,
from
that
halt
and
the
superior
quality
of
its
furniture
,
I
conjecture
to
be
the
good
one
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
carpet
 
<EOS>
a
good
one
,
but
the
pattern
be
obliterate
by
dust
;
a
fireplace
hang
with
cut

paper
,
drop
to
piece
;
a
handsome
oak
-
bedstead
with
ample
crimson
curtain
of
rather
expensive
material
and
modern
make
;
<EOS>
but
they
have
evidently
experience
rough
usage
:
the
vallance
hang
in
festoon
,
wrench
from
their
ring
,
and
the
iron
rod
support
them
be
bent
in
an
arc
on
one
side
,
cause
the
drapery
to
trail
upon
the
floor

<EOS>
the
chair
be
also
damage

many
of
them
severely
;
and
deep
indentation
deform
the
panel
of
the

I
be
endeavour

he
go
on

to

take
the
candle
with
him

I
remain
in
the
dark

<EOS>
the
period
of
reflection
succeed
this
silly
action
compel
me
to
admit
the
necessity
of
smother
my
pride
and
choke
my
wrath
,
and
bestir
myself
to
remove
its
effect
.
<EOS>
an
unexpected
aid
presently
appear
in
the
shape
of
Throttler
,
whom
I
now
recognise
as
a
son
of
our
old
Skulker
:
it
have
spend
its
whelphood
at
the
Grange
,
and
be
give
by
my
father
to
Mr.
Hindley
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
it
know
me
:
it
push
its
nose
against
mine
by
way
of
salute
,
and
then
hasten
to
devour
the
porridge
;
while
I
grope
from
step
to
step
,
collect
the
shatter
earthenware
,
and
dry
the
spatter
of
milk
from
the
banister
with
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Our
labour
be
scarcely
over
when
I
hear
Earnshaw
's
tread
in
the
passage
;
my
assistant
tuck
in
his
tail
,
and
press
to
the
wall
;
I
steal
into
the
near
doorway
.
<EOS>
the
dog
's
endeavour
to
avoid
him
be
unsuccessful
;
as
I
guess
by
a
scutter
down
-
stair
,
and
a
prolonged
,
piteous
yelping
.
<EOS>
I
have
well
luck
:
he
pass
on
,
enter
his
chamber
,
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
directly
after
Joseph
come
up
with
Hareton
,
to
put
him
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
have
find
shelter
in
Hareton
's
room
,
and
the
old
man
,
on
see
me
,
say
,
 
"

<EOS>
gladly
do
I
take
advantage
of
this
intimation
;
and
the
minute
I
fling
myself
into
a
chair
,
by
the
fire
,
I
nod
,
and
sleep
.
<EOS>
My
slumber
be
deep
and
sweet
,
though
over
far
too
soon

<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
awake
me
;
he
have
just
come
in
,
and
demand
,
in
his
loving
manner
,
what
I
be
do
there
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
cause
of
my
staying
up
<EOS>
so
late
 
that
he
have
the
key
of
our
room
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
the
adjective
<EOS>
_
our
_
give
mortal
offence
.
<EOS>
He
swear
it
be
not
,
nor
ever
should
be
,
mine
;
and
he
would
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
repeat
his
language
,
nor
describe
his
habitual
conduct
:
he
be
ingenious
and
unreste
in
seek
to
gain
my
abhorrence
!
<EOS>
I
sometimes
wonder
at
him
with
an
intensity
that
deaden
my
fear
:
<EOS>
yet
,
I
assure
you
,
a
tiger
or
a
venomous
serpent
could
not
rouse
terror
in
me
equal
to
that
which
he
waken
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
of
Catherine
's
illness
,
and
accuse
my
brother
of
cause
it
promise
that
I
should
be
Edgar
's
proxy
in
suffering
,
till
he
could
get
hold
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
hate
him
 
<EOS>
I
be
wretched
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
fool
!
<EOS>
beware
of
utter
one
breath
of
this

ISABELLA

<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
peruse
this
epistle
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
master
,
and
inform
him
that
his
sister
have
arrive
at
the
Heights
,
and
send
me
a
letter
express
her
sorrow
for
Mrs.
Linton
's
situation
,
and
her
ardent
desire
to
see
him
;
with
a
wish
that
he
would
transmit
to
her
,
as
early
as
possible
,
some
token
of
forgiveness
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgiveness
!
"
say
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
forgive
her
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
You
may
call
at
Wuthering
Heights
this
afternoon

if
you
like
,
and
say
that
I
be
not
angry
,
but
I
be
sorry
to
have
lose
her
;
especially
as
I
can
never
think
she
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
It
be
out
of
the
question
my
go
to
see
her
,
however
:
we
be
eternally
divide
;
and
should
she
really
wish
to
oblige
me
,
let
her
persuade
the
villain
she
have
marry
to
leave
the
country
.

<EOS>

and
you
will
not
write
her
a
little
note

I
ask
,
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
needless
.
<EOS>
My
communication
with

<EOS>
Mr.
Edgar
's
coldness
depress
me
exceedingly
;
and
all
the
way
from
the
Grange
I
puzzle
my
brain
how
to
put
more
heart
into
what
he
say
,
when
I
repeat
it
;
and
how
to
soften
his
refusal
of
even
a
few
line
to
console
Isabella
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
have
be
on
the
watch
for
me
since
morning
:
<EOS>
I
see
her
look
through
the
lattice
as
I
come
up
the
garden
causeway
,
and
I
nod
to
her
;
but
she
draw
back
,
as
if
afraid
of
be
observe
.
<EOS>
I
enter
without
knock
.
<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
dreary
,
dismal
scene
as
the
formerly
cheerful
house
present
!
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
that
if
I
have
be
in
the
young
lady
's
place
,
I
would
,
at
least
,
have
sweep
the
hearth
,
and
wipe
the
table
with
a
duster
.
<EOS>
but
she
already
partake
of
the
pervading
spirit
of
neglect
which
encompass
her
.
<EOS>
Her
pretty
face
be
wan
and
listless
;
her
hair
uncurl
:
<EOS>
some
lock
hang
lankly
down
,
and
some
carelessly
twist
round
her
head
.
<EOS>
probably
she
have
not
touch
her
dress
since
yester
evening
.
<EOS>
Hindley
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
sit
at
a
table
,
turn
over
some
paper
in
his
pocket
-
book
;
but
he
rise
when
I
appear
,
ask
me
how
I
do
,
quite
friendly
,
and
offer
me
a
chair
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
thing
there
that
seem
decent
;
and
I
think
he
never
look
better
.
<EOS>
so
much
have
circumstance
alter
their
position
,
that
he
would
certainly
have
strike
a
stranger
as
a
bear
and
breed
gentleman
;
and
his
wife
as
a
thorough
little
slattern
!
<EOS>
She
come
forward
eagerly
to
greet
me
,
and
hold
out
one
hand
to
take
the
expect
letter
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
understand
the
hint
,
but
follow
me
to
a
sideboard
,
where
I
go
to
lay
my
bonnet
,
and
importune
me
in
a
whisper
to
give
her
directly
what
I
have
bring
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
guess
the
meaning
of
her
manoeuvre
,
and
say
 
"
if
you
have
get
anything
for
Isabella
(
as
no
doubt
you
have
,
nelly
)
,
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
make
a
secret
of
it
:
we
have
no
secret
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
have
nothing
,
"
I
reply
,
think
it
best
to
speak
the
truth
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
bid
me
tell
his
sister
that
she
must
not
expect
either
a
letter
or
a
visit
from
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
He
send
his
love
,
madam
,
and
his
wish
for
your
happiness
,
and
his
pardon
for
the
grief
you
have
occasion
;
but
he
think
that
after
this
time
his
household
and
the
household
here
should
drop
intercommunication
,
as
nothing
could
come
of
keep
it
up

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heathcliff
's
lip
quiver
slightly
,
and
she
return
to
her
seat
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
take
his
stand
on
the
hearthstone
,
near
me
,
and
begin
to
put
question
concern
Catherine
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
as
much
as
I
think
proper
of
her
illness
,
and
he
extort
from
me
,
by
cross
-
examination
,
most
of
the
fact
connect
with
its
origin
.
<EOS>
I
blame
her
,
as
she
deserve
,
for
bring
it
all
on
herself
;
and
end
by
hope
that
he
would
follow
Mr.

example
and
avoid
future
interference
with
his
family
,
for
good
or
evil

be
now
just
recover
,
"
I
say
;
"
she
will
never
be
like
she
be
,
but
her
life
be
spare
;
and
if
you
really
have
a
regard
for
her
,
you
will
shun
cross
her
way
again
:
<EOS>
nay
,
you
will
move
out
of
this
country
entirely
;
and
that
you
may
not
regret
it
,
I
will
inform
you
Catherine
Linton
be
as
different
now
from
your
old
friend
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
as
that
young
lady
be
different
from
me
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
be
change
greatly
,
her
character
much
more
so
;
and
the
person
who
be
compel
,
of
necessity
,
to
be
her
companion
,
will
only
sustain
his
affection
hereafter
by
the
remembrance
of
what
she
once
be
,
by
common
humanity
,
and
a
sense
of
duty
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
quite
possible
,
"
remark
Heathcliff
,
force
himself
to
seem
calm
:
"
quite
possible
that
your
master
should
have
nothing
but
common
humanity
and
a
sense
of
duty
to
fall
back
upon
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
imagine
that
I
shall
leave
Catherine
to
his
_
duty
_
and
_
humanity
_
?
<EOS>
and
can
you
compare
my
feeling
respect
Catherine
to
his
?
<EOS>
before
you
leave
this
house
,
I
must
exact
a
promise
from
you
that
you
will
get
me
an
interview
with
her
:
consent
,
or
refuse
,
I
_
will
_
see
her
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
reply
,
"
you
must
not
:
you
never
shall
,
through
my
mean
.
<EOS>
another
encounter
between
you
and
the
master
would
kill
her
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
your
aid
that
may
be
avoid
,
"
he
continue
;
"
and
should
there
be
danger
of
such
an
event
 
<EOS>
should
he
be
the
cause
of
add
a
single
trouble
more
to
her
existence
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
think
I
shall
be
justify
in
go
to
extreme
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
sincerity
enough
to
tell
me
whether
Catherine
would
suffer
greatly
from
his
loss
:
the
fear
that
she
would
restrain
me
.
<EOS>
and
there
you
see
the
distinction
between
our
feeling
:
have
he
be
in
my
place
,
and
I
in
his
,
though
I
hate
him
with
a
hatred
that
turn
my
life
to
gall
<EOS>
,
I
never
would
have
raise
a
hand
against
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
look
incredulous
,
if
you
please
!
<EOS>
I
never
would
have
banish
him
from
her
society
as
long
as
she
desire
his
.
<EOS>
the
moment
her
regard
cease
,
I
would
have
tear
his
heart
out
,
and
drunk
his
blood
!
<EOS>
but
,
till
then
 
if
you
do
not
believe
me
,
you
do
not
know
me
 
till
then
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
die
by
inch
before
I
touch
a
single
hair
of
his
head
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
"
I
interrupt
,
"
you
have
no
scruple
in
completely
ruin
all
hope
of
her
perfect
restoration
,
by
thrust
yourself
into
her
remembrance
now
,
when
she
have
nearly
forget
you
,
and
involve
her
in
a
new
tumult
of
discord
and
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
she
have
nearly
forget
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
nelly
!
<EOS>
you
know
she
have
not
!
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
for
every
thought
she
spend
on
Linton
she
spend
a
thousand
on
me
!
<EOS>
at
a
most
miserable
period
of
my
life
,
I
have
a
notion
of
the
kind
:
it
haunt
me
on
my
return
to
the
neighbourhood
last
summer
;
but
only
her
own
assurance
could
make
me
admit
the
horrible
idea
again
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
Linton
would
be
nothing
,
nor
Hindley
,
nor
all
the
dream
that
ever
I
dreamt
.
<EOS>
two
word
would
comprehend
my
future
 
_
death
_
and
_
hell
<EOS>
_
:
<EOS>
existence
,
after
lose
her
,
would
be
hell
.
<EOS>
yet
I
be
a
fool
to
fancy
for
a
moment
that
she
value
Edgar
Linton
's
attachment
more
than
mine
.
<EOS>
if
he
love
with
all
the
power
of
his
puny
being
,
he
could
not
love
as
much
in
eighty
year
as
I
could
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
and
Catherine
have
a
heart
as
deep
as
I
have
:
the
sea
could
be
as
readily
contain
in
that
horse
-
trough
as
her
whole
affection
be
monopolise
by
him
.
<EOS>
tush
!
<EOS>
He
be
scarcely
a
degree
dearer
to
her
than
her
dog
,
or
her
horse
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
him
to
be
love
like
me
:
how
can
she
love
in
him
what
he
have
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
and
Edgar

as
fond
of

other
as
any
two
people

Isabella

with
sudden
vivacity

<EOS>
"
no

a

I

Your

Heathcliff

scornfully

turn
you
adrift

surprising
alacrity

He

:
you

you

no

My
young

be
look
sadly
the
bad
for

change
of
condition

"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
somebody
's
love
come
short
in
her
case

obviously
;
whose
,
I
may
guess
;

,
perhaps
,
I
should
not

.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
guess
it
be
her
own

Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
She
degenerate
into
a
mere
slut
!
<EOS>
She
be
tired
of
try
to
please
me
uncommonly
early
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
credit
it
,
but
the
very
morrow
of
our
wedding
she
be
weep
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
will
suit
this
house
so
much
the
well
for
not
be
over
nice
,
and
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
she
do
not
disgrace
me
by
ramble
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
return
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
consider
that
Mrs.
Heathcliff
be
accustomed
to
be
look
after
and
wait
on
;
and
that
she
have
be
bring
up
like
an
only
daughter
,
whom
every
one
be
ready
to
serve
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
her
have
a
maid
to
keep
thing
tidy
about
her
,
and
you
must
treat
her
kindly
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
your
notion
of
Mr.
Edgar
,
you
can
not
doubt
that
she
have
a
capacity
for
strong
attachment
,
or
she
would
not
have
abandon
the
elegancie
,
and
comfort
,
and
friend
of
her
former
home
,
to
fix
contentedly
,
in
such
a
wilderness
as
this
,
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
abandon
them
under
a
delusion
,
"
he
answer
;
"
picture
in
me
a
hero
of
romance
,
and
expect
unlimited
indulgence
from
my
chivalrous
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
regard
her
in
the
light
of
a
rational
creature
,
so
obstinately
have
she
persist
in
form
a
fabulous
notion
of
my
character
and
act
on
the
false
impression
she
cherish
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
last
,
I
think
she
begin
to
know
me
:
I
do
not
perceive
the
silly
smile
and
grimace
that
provoke
me
at
first
;
and
the
senseless
incapability
of
discerning
that
I
be
in
earnest
when
I
give
her
my
opinion
of
her
infatuation
and
herself
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
marvellous
effort
of
perspicacity
to
discover
that
I
do
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
at
one
time
,
no
lesson
could
teach
her
that
!
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
poorly
learn
;
for
this
morning
she
announce
,
as
a
piece
of
appalling
intelligence
,
that
I
have
actually
succeed
in
make
her
hate
me
!
<EOS>
a
positive
labour
of
hercule
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
achieve
,
I
have
cause
to
return
thank
.
<EOS>
Can
I
trust
your
assertion
,
Isabella
?
<EOS>
be
you
sure
you
hate
me
?
<EOS>
if
I
let
you
alone
for
half
a
day
,
will
not
you
come
sigh
and
wheedle
to
me
again
?
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
would
<EOS>
rather
I
have
seem
all
tenderness
before
you
:
it
wound
her
vanity
to
have
the
truth
expose
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
care
who
know
that
the
passion
be
wholly
on
one
side
:
<EOS>
and
I
never
tell
her
a
lie
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
accuse
me
of
show
one
bit
of
deceitful
softness
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
she
see
me
do
,
on
come
out
of
the
Grange
,
be
to
hang
up
her
little
dog
;
and
when
she
plead
for
it
,
the
first
word
I
utter
be
a
wish
that
I
have
the
hanging
of
every
be
belong
to
her
,
except
one
:
<EOS>
possibly
she
take
that
exception
for
herself
.
<EOS>
but
no
brutality
disgust
her
:
I
suppose
she
have
an
innate
admiration
of
it
,
if
only
her
precious
person
be
secure
from
injury
!
<EOS>
now
,
be
it
not
the
depth
of
absurdity
 
of
genuine
idiotcy
,
for
that
pitiful
,
slavish
,
mean
-
minded
brach
to
dream
that
I
could
love
her
?
<EOS>
tell
your
master
,
nelly
,
that
I
never
,
in
all
my
life
,
meet
with
such
an
abject
thing
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
She
even
disgrace
the
name
of
Linton
;
and
I
have
sometimes
relent
,
from
pure
lack
of
invention
,
in
my
experiment
on
what
she
could
endure
,
and
still
creep
shamefully
cringe
back
!
<EOS>
but
tell
him
,
also
,
to
set
his
fraternal
and
magisterial
heart
at
ease
:
that
I
keep
strictly
within
the
limit
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
have
avoid
,
up
to
this
period
,
give
her
the
slight
right
to
claim
a
separation
;
and
,
what
be
more
,
she
would
thank
nobody
for
divide
us
.
<EOS>
if
she
desire
to
go
,
she
may
:
the
nuisance
of
her
presence
outweigh
the
gratification
to
be
derive
from
torment
her
!

<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff

"
say
I
,
"
this
be
the
talk

a
madman

mad

for
that
reason

she
have

with

now
that
you
say
she
may
go

she
will
doubtless
avail
herself

the
permission

their
expression

full
success

only

promise

his
infamous
conversation
to
my
brother

Catherine

whatever
he
may
pretend

he

to

Edgar

desperation

pleasure

well
to
prevent
my
come
in
contact
with
them
,
or
their
master
?
<EOS>
and
you
could
do
it
so
easily
.
<EOS>
I
would
warn
you
when
I
come
,
and
then
you
may
let
me
in
unobserved
,
as
soon
as
she
be
alone
,
and
watch
till
I
depart
,
your
conscience
quite
calm
:
you
would
be
hinder
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
protest
against
play
that
treacherous
part
in
my
employer
's
house
:
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
urge
the
cruelty
and
selfishness
of
his
destroy
Mrs.
Linton
's
tranquillity
for
his
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
common
occurrence
startle
her
painfully
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
all
nerve
,
and
she
could
not
bear
the
surprise
,
I
be
positive
.
<EOS>
do
not
persist
,
sir
!
<EOS>
or
else
I
shall
be
oblige
to
inform
my
master
of
your
design
;
and
he
will
take
measure
to
secure
his
house
and
its
inmate
from
any
such
unwarrantable
intrusion
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
I
will
take
measure
to
secure
you
,
woman
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Heathcliff
;
"
you
shall
not
leave
Wuthering
Heights
till
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
foolish
story
to
assert
that
Catherine
could
not
bear
to
see
me
;
and
as
to
surprise
her
,
I
do
not
desire
it
<EOS>
:
you
must
prepare
her
 
ask
her
if
I
may
come
.
<EOS>
You
say
she
never
mention
my
name
,
and
that
I
be
never
mention
to
her
.
<EOS>
to
whom
should
she
mention
me
if
I
be
a
forbid
topic
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
She
think
you
be
all
spy
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
have
no
doubt
she
be
in
hell
among
you
!
<EOS>
I
guess
by
her
silence
,
as
much
as
anything
,
what
she
feel
.
<EOS>
You
say
she
be
often
restless
,
and
anxious
-
looking
:
be
that
a
proof
of
tranquillity
?
<EOS>
You
talk
of
her
mind
be
unsettle
.
<EOS>
how
the
devil
could
it
be
otherwise
in
her
frightful
isolation
?
<EOS>
and
that
insipid
,
paltry
creature
attend
her
from
_
duty
_
and
_
humanity
_
!
<EOS>
from
_
pity
_
and
_
charity
_
!
<EOS>
He
may
as
well
plant
an
oak
in
a
flower
-
pot
,
and
expect
it
to
thrive
,
as
imagine
he
can
restore
her
to
vigour
in
the
soil
of
his
shallow
care
?
<EOS>
let
us
settle
it
at
once
:
will
you
stay
here
,
and
be
I
to
fight
my
way
to
Catherine
over
Linton
and
his
footman
?
<EOS>
or
will
you
be
my
friend
,
as
you
have
be
hitherto
,
and
do
what
I
request
?
<EOS>
decide
!
<EOS>
because
there
be
no
reason
for
my
linger
another
minute
,
if
you
persist
in
your
stubborn
ill
-
nature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
argue
and
complain
,
and
flatly
refuse
him
fifty
time
;
but
in
the
long
run
he
force
me
to
an
agreement
.
<EOS>
I
engage
to
carry
a
letter
from
him
to
my
mistress
;
and
should
she
consent
,
I
promise
to
let
him
have
intelligence
of
Linton
's
next
absence
from
home
,
when
he
may
come
,
and
get
in
as
he
be
able
:
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
there
,
and
my
fellow
-
servant
should
be
equally
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
be
it
right
or
wrong
?
<EOS>
I
fear
it
be
wrong
,
though
expedient
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
prevent
another
explosion
by
my
compliance
;
and
I
think
,
too
,
it
may
create
a
favourable
crisis
in
Catherine
's
mental
illness
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
remember
Mr.
Edgar
's
stern
rebuke
of
my
carry
tale
;
and
I
try
to
smooth
away
all
disquietude
on
the
subject
,
by
affirm
,
with
frequent
iteration
,
that
that
betrayal
of
trust
,
if
it
merit
so
harsh
an
appellation
,
should
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
,
my
journey
homeward
be
sad
than
my
journey
thither
;
and
many
misgiving
I
have
,
ere
I
could
prevail
on
myself
to
put
the
missive
into
Mrs.
Linton
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
be
Kenneth
;
I
will
go
down
,
and
tell
him
how
much
better
you
be
.
<EOS>
My
history
be
_
dree
_
,
as
we
say
,
and
will
serve
to
while
away
another
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Dree
,
and
dreary
!
<EOS>
I
reflect
as
the
good
woman
descend
to
receive
the
doctor
:
and
not
exactly
of
the
kind
which
I
should
have
choose
to
amuse
me
.
<EOS>
but
never
mind
!
<EOS>
I
will
extract
wholesome
medicine
from
Mrs.
Dean
's
bitter
herb
;
and
firstly
,
let
me
beware
of
the
fascination
that
lurk
in
Catherine
Heathcliff
's
brilliant
eye
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
in
a
curious
taking
if
I
surrender
my
heart
to
that
young
person
,
and
the
daughter
turn
out
a
second
edition
of
the
mother
.
    
<EOS>
another
week
over
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
many
day
near
health
,
and
spring
!
<EOS>
I
have
now
hear
all
my
neighbour
's
history
,
at
different
sitting
,
as
the
housekeeper
could
spare
time
from
more
important
occupation
.
<EOS>
I
will
continue
it
in
her
own
word
,
only
a
little
condensed
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
on
the
whole
,
a
very
fair
narrator
,
and
I
do
not
think
I
could
improve
her
style
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
she
say
,
the
evening
of
my
visit
to
the
Heights
,
I
know
,
as
well
as
if
I
see
him
,
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
about
the
place
;
and
I
shun
go
out
,
because
I
still
carry
his
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
do
not
want
to
be
threaten
or
tease
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
not
to
give
it
till
my
master
go
somewhere
,
as
I
could
not
guess
how
its
receipt
would
affect
Catherine
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
it
do
not
reach
her
before
the
lapse
of
three
day
.
<EOS>
the
fourth
be
Sunday
,
and
I
bring
it
into
her
room
after
the
family
be
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
manservant
leave
to
keep
the
house
with
me
,
and
we
generally
make
a
practice
of
lock
the
door
during
the
hour
of
service
;
but
on
that
occasion
the
weather
be
so
warm
and
pleasant
that
I
set
them
wide
open
,
and
,
to
fulfil
my
engagement
,
as
I
know
who
would
be
come
,
I
tell
my
companion
that
the
mistress
wish
very
much
for
some
orange
,
and
he
must
run
over
to
the
village
and
get
a
few
,
to
be
pay
for
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
depart
,
and
I
go
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
sit
in
a
loose
white
dress
,
with
a
light
shawl
over
her
shoulder
,
in
the
recess
of
the
open
window
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Her
thick
,
long
hair
have
be
partly
remove
at
the
beginning
of
her
illness
,
and
now
she
wear
it
simply
comb
in
its
natural
tress
over
her
temple
and
neck
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
be
alter
,
as
I
have
tell
Heathcliff
;
but
when
she
be
calm
,
there
seem
unearthly
beauty
in
the
change
.
<EOS>
the
flash
of
her
eye
have
be
succeed
by
a
dreamy
and
melancholy
softness
;
they
no
longer
give
the
impression
of
look
at
the
object
around
her
:
they
appear
always
to
gaze
beyond
,
and
far
beyond
 
<EOS>
you
would
have
say
out
of
this
world
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
paleness
of
her
face
 
its
haggard
aspect
have
vanish
as
she
recover
flesh
 
and
the
peculiar
expression
arise
from
her
mental
state
,
though
painfully
suggestive
of
their
cause
,
add
to
the
touching
interest
which
she
awaken
;
and
 
invariably
to
me
,
I
know
,
and
to
any
person
who
see
her
,
I
should
think
 
refute
more
tangible
proof
of
convalescence
,
and
stamp
her
as
one
doom
to
decay
.
  
<EOS>
a
book
lie
spread
on
the
sill
before
her
,
and
the
scarcely
perceptible
wind
flutter
its
leave
at
interval
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Linton
have
lay
it
there
:
for
she
never
endeavour
to
divert
herself
with
reading
,
or
occupation
of
any
kind
,
and
he
would
spend
many
an
hour
in
try
to
entice
her
attention
to
some
subject
which
have
formerly
be
her
amusement
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
his
aim
,
and
in
her
well
mood
endure
his
effort
placidly
,
only
show
their
uselessness
by
now
and
then
suppress
a
wearied
sigh
,
and
check
him
at
last
with
the
saddest
of
smile
and
kiss
.
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
she
would
turn
petulantly
away
,
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hand
,
or
even
push
him
off
angrily
;
and
then
he
take
care
to
let
her
alone
,
for
he
be
certain
of
do
no
good
.
  
<EOS>
Gimmerton
chapel
bell
be
still
ring
;
and
the
full
,
mellow
flow
of
the
beck
in
the
valley
come
soothingly
on
the
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sweet
substitute
for
the
yet
absent
murmur
of
the
summer
foliage
,
which
drown
that
music
about
the
grange
when
the
tree
be
in
leaf
.
<EOS>
at
Wuthering
Heights
it
always
sound
on
quiet
day
follow
a
great
thaw
or
a
season
of
steady
rain
.
<EOS>
and
of
Wuthering
Heights
Catherine
be
think
as
she
listen
:
that
is
,
if
she
think
or
listen
at
all
;
but
she
have
the
vague
,
distant
look
I
mention
before
,
which
express
no
recognition
of
material
thing
either
by
ear
or
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
letter
for
you
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
"
I
say
,
gently
insert
it
in
one
hand
that
rest
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
read
it
immediately
,
because
it
want
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
break
the
seal
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
answer
,
without
alter
the
direction
of
her
eye
.
<EOS>
I
open
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
very
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
I
continue
,
"
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
draw
away
her
hand
,
and
let
it
fall
.
<EOS>
I
replace
it
in
her
lap
,
and
stand
wait
till
it
should
please
her
to
glance
down
;
but
that
movement
be
so
long
delay
that
at
last
I
resume
 
"
Must
I
read
it
,
madam
?
<EOS>
It
be
from
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
start
and
a
troubled
gleam
of
recollection
,
and
a
struggle
to
arrange
her
idea
.
<EOS>
She
lift
the
letter
,
and
seem
to
peruse
it
;
and
when
she
come
to
the
signature
she
sigh
:
yet
still
I
find
she
have
not
gather
its
import
,
for
,
upon
my
desiring
to
hear
her
reply
,
she
merely
point
to
the
name
,
and
gaze
at
me
with
mournful
and
question
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
wish
to
see
you
,
"
say
I
,
guess
her
need
of
an
interpreter
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
the
garden
by
this
time
,
and
impatient
to
know
what
answer
I
shall
bring
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
I
speak
,
I
observe
a
large
dog
lie
on
the
sunny
grass
beneath
raise
its
ear
as
if
about
to
bark
,
and
then
smooth
them
back
,
announce
,
by
a
wag
of
the
tail
,
that
some
one
approach
whom
it
do
not
consider
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
bend
forward
,
and
listen
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
the
minute
after
a
step
traverse
the
hall
;
the
open
house
be
too
tempting
for
Heathcliff
to
resist
walk
in
<EOS>
:
most
likely
he
suppose
that
I
be
inclined
to
shirk
my
promise
,
and
so
resolve
to
trust
to
his
own
audacity
.
<EOS>
with
strain
eagerness
Catherine
gaze
towards
the
entrance
of
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
hit
the
right
room
directly
:
she
motion
me
to
admit
him
,
but
he
find
it
out
ere
I
could
reach
the
door
,
and
in
a
stride
or
two
be
at
her
side
,
and
have
her
grasp
in
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
He
neither
speak
nor
loose
his
hold
for
some
five
minute
,
during
which
period
he
bestow
more
kiss
than
ever
he
give
in
his
life
before
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
:
<EOS>
but
then
my
mistress
have
kiss
him
first
,
and
I
plainly
see
that
he
could
hardly
bear
,
for
downright
agony
,
to
look
into
her
face
!
<EOS>
the
same
conviction
have
stricken
him
as
me
,
from
the
instant
he
behold
her
,
that
there
be
no
prospect
of
ultimate
recovery
there
 
<EOS>
she
be
fate
,
sure
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Cathy
!
<EOS>
oh
,
my
life
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
first
sentence
he
utter
,
in
a
tone
that
do
not
seek
to
disguise
his
despair
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
stare
at
her
so
earnestly
that
I
think
the
very
intensity
of
his
gaze
would
bring
tear
into
his
eye
;
but
they
burn
with
anguish
:
they
do
not
melt
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
now
?
"
say
Catherine
,
lean
back
,
and
return
his
look
with
a
suddenly
cloud
brow
:
<EOS>
her
humour
be
a
mere
vane
for
constantly
vary
caprice
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
Edgar
have
break
my
heart
,
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
and
you
both
come
to
bewail
the
deed
to
me
,
as
if
you
be
the
people
to
be
pity
!
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pity
you

not
I.
<EOS>
You
have
kill
me
 
and
thrive
on

strong
you

<EOS>
how
many
year
do
you
mean

live
after
I
be
go

"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
have
kneel
on
one
knee
to
embrace
her
;
he
attempt
to
rise
,
but
she
seize
his
hair
,
and
keep
him
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
hold
you

she
continue
,
bitterly
,
"
till
we
be
both
dead

I
should
not
care
what
you
suffer

<EOS>
I
care
nothing
for
your
suffering

<EOS>
why
should
not
you
suffer
?
<EOS>
I
do

<EOS>
Will
you
forget
me
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
happy
when
I
be
in
the
earth

<EOS>
Will
you
say
twenty
year
hence
,
"
that
be
the
grave
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
?
<EOS>
I
love
her
long
ago
,
and
be
wretched
to
lose
her
;
but
it
be
past
.
<EOS>
I
have
love
many
other
since
:
my
child
be
dearer
to
me
than
she
be

and
,
at

I
shall
not
rejoice
that
I

you

so
,
Heathcliff

not
torture
me
till
I

his

free
,
and
grind
his
tooth

<EOS>
the
two
,
to
a
cool
spectator
,
make
a
strange
and
fearful
picture
.
<EOS>
well
may
catherine
deem
that
heaven
would
be
a
land
of
exile
to
her
,
unless
with
her
mortal
body
she
cast
away
her
moral
character
also
.
<EOS>
Her
present
countenance
have
a
wild
vindictiveness
in
its
white
cheek
,
and
a
bloodless
lip
and
scintillate
eye
;
and
she
retain
in
her
closed
finger
a
portion
of
the
lock
she
have
be
grasp
.
<EOS>
as
to
her
companion
,
while
raise
himself
with
one
hand
,
he
have
take
her
arm
with
the
other
;
and
so
inadequate
be
his
stock
of
gentleness
to
the
requirement
of
her
condition
,
that
on
his
letting
go
<EOS>
I
see
four
distinct
impression
leave
blue
in
the
colourless
skin
.
  
<EOS>
"

savagely

talk
in
that
manner

me

do
you
reflect
that
all
those
word

be
brand
in
my
memory

eat
deep
eternally
after

You

to

I
have

you

Catherine

soon

be
it
not
sufficient
for
your
infernal
selfishness

that
while
you
be
at
peace
I
shall
writhe
in
the
torment
of
hell

<EOS>

I

Catherine

<EOS>
recall
to
a
sense
of
physical
weakness
by
the
violent
,
unequal
throbbing
of
her
heart

which
beat
visibly
and
audibly
under
this
excess
of
agitation

She
say
nothing
further
till
the
paroxysm
be
over
;
then
she
continue

more
kindly
    
"

<EOS>
Heathcliff
go
to
the
back
of
her
chair
,
and
leant
over
,
but
not
so
far
as
to
let
her
see
his
face
,
which
be
livid
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
She
bend
round
to
look
at
him
;
he
would
not
permit
it
:
turn
abruptly
<EOS>
,
he
walk
to
the
fireplace
,
where
he
stand
,
silent
,
with
his
back
towards
us
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
's
glance
follow
him
suspiciously
:
every
movement
wake
a
new
sentiment
in
her
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
and
a
prolonged
gaze
,
she
resume
;
address
me
in
accent
of
indignant
disappointment
:
    
"
oh
,
you
see
,
<EOS>
nelly
,
he
would
not
relent
a
moment
to
keep
me
out
of
the
grave

how

never

that

I
shall
love
mine
yet
;

take
him
with
me
:
he
be
in
my
soul

<EOS>
and
,
"
add
she
musingly
,
"
the
thing
that
irk
me
most
be
this
shatter
prison
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
tired
of
be
enclose
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
weary
to
escape
into
that
glorious
world
,
and
to
be
always
there
:
not
see
it
dimly
through
tear
,
and
yearn
for
it
through
the
wall
of
an
ache
heart
:
but
really
with
it
,
and
in
it
.
<EOS>
nelly
,
you
think
you
be
well

more
fortunate
than
I

in
full
health

<EOS>
She
go
on
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
wish
it
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
dear
!
<EOS>
you
should
not
be
sullen
now
.
<EOS>
do
come
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
in
her
eagerness
she
rise
and
support
herself
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
.
<EOS>
at
that
earnest
appeal
he
turn
to
her
,
look
absolutely
desperate
.
<EOS>
His
eye
,
wide
and
wet
,
at
last
flash
fiercely
on
her
;
his
breast
heave
convulsively
.
<EOS>
an
instant
they
hold
asunder
,
and
then
how
they
meet
I
hardly
see
,
but
Catherine
make
a
spring
,
and
he
catch
her
,
and
they
be
lock
in
an
embrace
from
which
I
think
my
mistress
would
never
be
release
alive
:
in
fact
,
to
my
eye
,
she
seem
directly
insensible
.
<EOS>
He
fling
himself
into
the
near
seat
,
and
on
my
approach
hurriedly
to
ascertain
if
she
have
faint
,
he
gnash
at
me
,
and
foam
like
a
mad
dog
,
and
gather
her
to
him
with
greedy
jealousy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
as
if
I
be
in
the
company
of
a
creature
of
my
own
specie
:
it
appear
that
he
would
not
understand
,
though
I
speak
to
him
;
so
I
stand
off
,
and
hold
my
tongue
,
in
great
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
a
movement
of
Catherine
's
relieve
me
a
little
presently
:
she
put
up
her
hand
to
clasp
his
neck
,
and
bring
her
cheek
to
his
as
he
hold
her
;
while
he
,
in
return
,
cover
her
with
frantic
caress
,
say
wildly
    
"
You
teach
me
now
how
cruel
you
have
be
 
cruel

false

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
why

you
despise

<EOS>
I
have
not

<EOS>
You
deserve
this

<EOS>
You
have
kill
yourself

<EOS>
yes
,
you
may
kiss
me
,
and
cry
;
and
wring
out
my
kiss
and
tear
<EOS>
:
they
will
blight
you
 
<EOS>
they
will
damn
you

<EOS>
You
love
me
 
then

what
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
right
<EOS>
_
have
you
to
leave
me
?
<EOS>
what
right
 
answer
me
 
for
the
poor
fancy
you
feel
for
Linton
?
<EOS>
because
misery
and
degradation
,
and
death
,
and
nothing
that
God
or
Satan
could
inflict
would
have
part
us
,
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
of
your

do
it

I
have
not
break

break
it

in
break
it

you
have
break
mine

<EOS>
so
much
the
bad
for
me
that
I
be
strong

<EOS>
do
I
want
to
live

<EOS>
what
kind
of
living
will
it
be
when
you
 
<EOS>
oh

God
!
<EOS>
would
_
you

_
like
to
live

"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
let

alone

sob
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
do
wrong
,
I
be
die
for

It

enough

forgive

"
It
be
hard
to
forgive
,

to
look
at
those
eye
,
and
feel
those
waste
hand
,

he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
kiss
me
again
;
and
do
not
let
me
see
your
eye
!
<EOS>
I
forgive
what
you

I

my

but
_
yours

!
<EOS>
how
can
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
silent
 
<EOS>
their
face
hide
against
each
other
,
and
wash
by
each
other
's
tear
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
suppose
the
weeping
be
on
both
side
;
as
it
seem
Heathcliff
could
weep
on
a
great
occasion
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
I
grow
very
uncomfortable
,
meanwhile
;
for
the
afternoon
wear
fast
away
,
the
man
whom
I
have
send
off
return
from
his
errand
,
and
I
could
distinguish
,
by
the
shine
of
the
western
sun
up
the
valley
,
a
concourse
thicken
outside
Gimmerton
chapel
porch
.
  
<EOS>
"
service
be
over
,
"
I
announce
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
will
be
here
in
half
an
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
groan
a
curse
,
and
strain
Catherine
closer
:
she
never
move
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
perceive
a
group
of
the
servant
pass
up
the
road
towards
the
kitchen
wing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
be
not
far
behind
;
he
open
the
gate
himself
and
saunter
slowly
up
,
probably
enjoy
the
lovely
afternoon
that
breathe
as
soft
as
summer
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
he
be
here
,
"
I
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
for
heaven
's
sake
,
hurry
down
!
<EOS>
You
will
not
meet
any
one
on
the
front
stair
.
<EOS>
do
be
quick
;
and
stay
among
the
tree
till
he
be
fairly
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
Cathy
,
"
say
Heathcliff
,
seek
to
extricate
himself
from
his
companion
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
live
,
I
will
see
you
again
before
you
be
asleep

I
will
not
stray
five
yard
from
your
window

<EOS>
"
You
must
not

answer
,
hold
him
as
firmly
as
her
strength
allow

<EOS>
"
You

shall

not

tell
you

<EOS>

for
one
hour

he
plead
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
not

she
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

will
be
up
immediately

persist
the
alarmed
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
rise
,
and
unfixe
her
finger
by
the
act
 
she
cling
fast
,
gasp
<EOS>
:
there
be
mad
resolution
in
her
face

<EOS>
"
no

she
shriek
.
<EOS>
"

the

there
he

cry
Heathcliff

sink
back
into
his
seat

shoot
me
so

I
would
expire
with
a
blessing
on
my
lip

"
  
<EOS>
and
there
they
be
fast
again
.
<EOS>
I
hear
my
master
mount
the
stair
 
<EOS>
the
cold
sweat
run
from
my
forehead
:
I
be
horrify
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
listen
to
her
raving

I
say
,
passionately
.

"
She
do
not
know
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
Will
you
ruin
her
,
because
she
have
not
wit
to
help
herself
?
<EOS>
get
up
!
<EOS>
You
could
be
free
instantly
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
most
diabolical
deed
that
ever
you
do

We
be
all
do
for
 
master

mistress
,
and
servant

<EOS>
I
wring
my
hand
,
and
cry
out
;
and
Mr.
Linton
hasten
his
step
at
the
noise
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
my
agitation
,
I
be
sincerely
glad
to
observe
that
Catherine
's
arm
have
fall
relaxed
,
and
her
head
hang
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
faint
,
or
dead
,
"
I
think
:
"
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
far
better
that
she
should
be
dead
,
than
linger
a
burden
and
a
misery
-
maker
to
all
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edgar
spring
to
his
unbidden
guest
,
blanch
with
astonishment
and
rage
.
<EOS>
what
he
mean
to
do
I
can
not
tell
;
however
,
the
other
stop
all
demonstration
,
at
once
,
by
place
the
lifeless
-
look
form
in
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
there
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
unless
you
be
a
fiend
,
help
her
first
 
<EOS>
then
you
shall
speak
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
walk
into
the
parlour
,
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
summon
me
,
and
with
great
difficulty
,
and
after
resort
to
many
mean
,
we
manage
to
restore
her
to
sensation
;
but
she
be
all
bewilder
;
she
sigh
,
and
moan
,
and
know
nobody
.
<EOS>
Edgar
,
in
his
anxiety
for
her
,
forget
her
hate
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
go
,
at
the
early
opportunity
,
and
besought
him
to
depart
;
affirm
that
Catherine
be
well
,
and
he
should
hear
from
me
in
the
morning
how
she
pass
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
refuse
to
go
out
of
door
,
"
he
answer
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
stay
in
the
garden
:
<EOS>
and
,
nelly
,
mind
you
keep
your
word
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
under
those
larch
-
tree
.
<EOS>
mind
!
<EOS>
or
I
pay
another
visit
,
whether
Linton
be
in
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
send
a
rapid
glance
through
the
half
-
open
door
of
the
chamber
,
and
,
ascertain
that
what
I
state
be
apparently
true
,
deliver
the
house
of
his
luckless
presence
.
    
<EOS>
about
twelve
o'clock
that
night
be
bear
the
Catherine
you
see
at
Wuthering
Heights
:
a
puny
,
seven
-
month
'
child
;
and
two
hour
after
the
mother
die
,
have
never
recover
sufficient
consciousness
to
miss
Heathcliff
,
or
know
Edgar
.
<EOS>
the
latter
's
distraction
at
his
bereavement
be
a
subject
too
painful
to
be
dwell
on
;
its
after
-
effect
show
how
deep
the
sorrow
sink
.
<EOS>
a
great
addition
,
in
my
eye
,
be
his
be
leave
without
an
heir
.
<EOS>
I
bemoan
that
,
as
I
gaze
on
the
feeble
orphan
;
and
I
mentally
abuse
old
Linton
for
(
what
be
only
natural
partiality
)
<EOS>
the
secure
his
estate
to
his
own
daughter
,
instead
of
his
son
's
.
<EOS>
an
unwelcomed
infant
<EOS>
it
be
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
It
may
have
wail
out
of
life
,
and
nobody
care
a
morsel
,
during
those
first
hour
of
existence
.
<EOS>
We
redeem
the
neglect
afterwards
;
but
its
beginning
be
as
friendless
as
its
end
be
likely
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
next
morning
 
bright
and
cheerful
out
of
door
 
stole
soften
in
through
the
blind
of
the
silent
room
,
and
suffuse
the
couch
and
its
occupant
with
a
mellow
,
tender
glow
.
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
have
his
head
lay
on
the
pillow
,
and
his
eye
shut
.
<EOS>
His
young
and
fair
feature
be
almost
as
deathlike
as
those
of
the
form
beside
him
,
and
almost
as
fix
:
but
_
his
_
be
the
hush
of
exhausted
anguish
,
and
_
her
_
of
perfect
peace
.
<EOS>
Her
brow
smooth
,
her
lid
close
,
her
lip
wear
the
expression
of
a
smile
;
no
angel
in
heaven
could
be
more
beautiful
than
she
appear
.
<EOS>
and
I
partook
of
the
infinite
calm
in
which
she
lie
<EOS>
:
my
mind
be
never
in
a
holy
frame
than
while
I
gaze
on
that
untroubled
image
of
Divine
rest
.
<EOS>
I
instinctively
echo
the
word
she
have
utter
a
few
hour
before
:
"
incomparably
beyond
and
above
us
all
!
<EOS>
whether
still
on
earth
or
now
in
heaven
,
her
spirit
be
at
home
with
God
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
a
peculiarity
in
me
,
but
I
be
seldom
otherwise
than
happy
while
watch
in
the
chamber
of
death
<EOS>
,
should
no
frenzied
or
despairing
mourner
share
the
duty
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
repose
that
neither
earth
nor
hell
can
break
,
and
I
feel
an
assurance
of
the
endless
and
shadowless
hereafter
 
<EOS>
the
eternity
they
have
enter
 
where
life
be
boundless
in
its
duration
,
and
love
in
its
sympathy
,
and
joy
in
its
fulness
.
<EOS>
I
notice
on
that
occasion
how
much
selfishness
there
be
even
in
a
love
like
Mr.
Linton
's
,
when
he
so
regret
Catherine
's
blessed
release
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
one
may
have
doubt
,
after
the
wayward
and
impatient
existence
<EOS>
she
have
lead
,
whether
she
merit
a
haven
of
peace
at
last
.
<EOS>
one
may
doubt
in
season
of
cold
reflection
;
but
not
then
,
in
the
presence
of
her
corpse
.
<EOS>
It
assert
its
own
tranquillity
,
which
seem
a
pledge
of
equal
quiet
to
its
former
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
believe
such
people
be
happy
in
the
other
world
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
would
give
a
great
deal
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
I
decline
answer
Mrs.
Dean
's
question
,
which
strike
me
as
something
heterodox
.
<EOS>
She
proceed
:
  
<EOS>
retrace
the
course
of
Catherine
Linton
,
I
fear
we
have
no
right
to
think
she
be
;
but
we
will
leave
her
with
her
maker
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
look
asleep
,
and
I
venture
soon
after
sunrise
to
quit
the
room
and
steal
out
to
the
pure
refreshing
air
.
<EOS>
the
servant
think
me
go
to
shake
off
the
drowsiness
of
my
protracted
watch
;
in
reality
,
my
chief
motive
be
see
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
remain
among
the
larch
all
night
,
he
would
have
hear
nothing
of
the
stir
at
the
grange
;
unless
,
perhaps
,
he
may
catch
the
gallop
of
the
messenger
go
to
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
come
near
,
he
would
probably
be
aware
,
from
the
light
flit
to
and
fro
,
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
outer
door
,
that
all
be
not
right
within
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
yet
fear
,
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
terrible
news
must
be
tell
,
and
I
long
to
get
it
over
;
but
how
to
do
it
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
He
be
there
 
at
least
,
a
few
yard
further
in
the
park
;
leant
against
an
old
ash
-
tree
,
his
hat
off
,
and
his
hair
soak
with
the
dew
that
have
gather
on
the
bud
branch
,
and
fall
patter
round
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
stand
a
long
time
in
that
position
,
for
I
see
a
pair
of
ousel
pass
and
repasse
scarcely
three
foot
from
him
,
busy
in
build
their
nest
,
and
regard
his
proximity
no
more
than
that
of
a
piece
of
timber
.
<EOS>
They
fly
off
at
my
approach
,
and
he
raise
his
eye
and
speak
:
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
I
have
not
wait
for
you
to
learn
that
.
<EOS>
put
your
handkerchief
away
 
do
not
snivel
before
me
.
<EOS>
damn
you
all
!
<EOS>
she
want
none
of
your
tear
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
weep
as
much
for
him
as
her
<EOS>
:
we
do
sometimes
pity
creature
that
have
none
of
the
feeling
either
for
themselves
or
other
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
look
into
his
face
,
I
perceive
that
he
have
get
intelligence
of
the
catastrophe
;
and
a
foolish
notion
strike
me
that
his
heart
be
quell
and
he
pray
,
because
his
lip
move
and
his
gaze
be
bent
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
check
my
sobs
and
dry
my
cheek
.
"
<EOS>
go
to
heaven
,
I
hope
;
where
we
may
,
<EOS>
every
one
,
join
her
,
if
we
take
due
warning
and
leave
our
evil
way
to
follow
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
_
<EOS>
she
_
take
due
warning
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Heathcliff
,
attempt
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
do
she
die
like
a
saint
?
<EOS>
come
,
give
me
a
true
history
of
the
event
.
<EOS>
how
do
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
pronounce
the
name
,
but
could
not
manage
it
;
and
compress
his
mouth
he
hold
a
silent
combat
with
his
inward
agony
,
defy
,
meanwhile
,
my
sympathy
with
an
unflinching
,
ferocious
stare
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
she
die
?
<EOS>
"
he
resume
,
at
last
 
fain
,
notwithstanding
his
hardihood
,
to
have
a
support
behind
him
;
for
,
after
the
struggle
,
he
tremble
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
his
very
finger
-
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
;
"
you
have
a
heart
and
nerve
the
same
as
your
brother
man
!
<EOS>
why
should
you
be
anxious
to
conceal
them
?
<EOS>
Your
pride
can
not
blind
God
!
<EOS>
You
tempt
him
to
wring
them
,
till
he
force
a
cry
of
humiliation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
quietly
as
a
lamb
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
She
draw
a
sigh
,
and
stretch
herself
,
like
a
child
reviving
,
and
sink
again
to
sleep
;
and
five
minute
after
I
feel
one
little
pulse
at
her
heart
,
and
nothing
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
 
do
she
ever
mention
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
hesitate
,
as
if
he
dread
the
answer
to
his
question
would
introduce
detail
that
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
sense
never
return
:
she
recognise
nobody
from
the
time
you
leave
her
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
She
lie
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
face
;
and
her
late
idea
wander
back
to
pleasant
early
day
.
<EOS>
Her
life
close
in
a
gentle
dream
 
<EOS>
may
she
wake
as
kindly
in
the
other
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
she
wake
in
torment
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
with
frightful
vehemence
,
stamp
his
foot
,
and
groan
in
a
sudden
paroxysm
of
ungovernable
passion
.
<EOS>
"
why

she
be
a
liar
to
the
end

and
I
pray
one
prayer
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
till
my
tongue
stiffen
 
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
may
you
not
rest
as
long
as
I

<EOS>
it

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

"
  
<EOS>
He
dash
his
head
against
the
knotted
trunk
;
and
,
lift
up
his
eye
,
howl
,
not
like
a
man
,
but
like
a
savage
beast
be
goad
to
death
with
knife
and
spear
.
<EOS>
I
observe
several
splash
of
blood
about
the
bark
of
the
tree
,
and
his
hand
and
forehead
be
both
stain
;
probably
the
scene
I
witness
be
a
repetition
of
other
act
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
hardly
move
my
compassion
 
<EOS>
it
appal
me
:
still
,
I
feel
reluctant
to
quit
him
so
.
<EOS>
but
the
moment
he
recollect
himself
enough
to
notice
me
watch
,
he
thunder
a
command
for
me
to
go
,
and
I
obey
.
<EOS>
He
be
beyond
my
skill
to
quiet
or
console
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Linton
's
funeral
be
appoint
to
take
place
on
the
Friday
follow
her
decease
;
and
till
then
her
coffin
remain
uncovered
,
and
strew
with
flower
and
scent
leave
,
in
the
great
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Linton
spend
his
day
and
night
there
,
a
sleepless
guardian
;
and
 
a
circumstance
conceal
from
all
but
me
 
<EOS>
Heathcliff
spend
his
night
,
at
least
,
outside
,
equally
a
stranger
to
repose
.
<EOS>
I
hold
no
communication
with
him
:
still
,
I
be
conscious
of
his
design
to
enter
,
if
he
could
;
and
on
the
Tuesday
,
a
little
after
dark
,
when
my
master
,
from
sheer
fatigue
,
have
be
compel
to
retire
a
couple
of
hour
,
I
go
and
open
one
of
the
window
;
move
by
his
perseverance
to
give
him
a
chance
of
bestow
on
the
fade
image
of
his
idol
one
final
adieu
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
omit
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
,
cautiously
and
briefly
;
too
cautiously
to
betray
his
presence
by
the
slight
noise
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
should
not
have
discover
that
he
have
be
there
,
except
for
the
disarrangement
of
the
drapery
about
the
corpse
's
face
,
and
for
observe
on
the
floor
a
curl
of
light
hair
,
fasten
with
a
silver
thread
;
which
,
on
examination
,
I
ascertain
to
have
be
take
from
a
locket
hang
round
Catherine
's
neck
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
have
open
the
trinket
and
cast
out
its
content
,
replace
them
by
a
black
lock
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
twist
the
two
,
and
enclose
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Earnshaw
be
,
of
course
,
invite
to
attend
the
remain
of
his
sister
to
the
grave
;
he
send
no
excuse
,
but
he
never
come
;
so
that
,
besides
her
husband
,
the
mourner
be
wholly
compose
of
tenant
and
servant
.
<EOS>
Isabella
be
not

<EOS>
the
place
of
Catherine
's
interment
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
villager
,
be
neither
in
the
chapel
under
the
carved
monument
of
the
Lintons
,
nor
yet
by
the
tomb
of
her
own
relation
,
outside
.
<EOS>
It
be
dig
on
a
green
slope
in
a
corner
of
the
kirk
-
yard
,
where
the
wall
be
so
low
that
heath
and
bilberry
-
plant
have
climb
over
it
from
the
moor
;
and
peat

mould
almost
bury
it
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
lie
in
the
same
spot
now
;
and
they
have
each
a
simple
headstone
above
,
and
a
plain
grey
block
at
their
foot
,
to
mark
the
grave

<EOS>
that
Friday
make
the
last

the
wind
shift
from
south
to
north

east
,
and
bring
rain
first
,
and
then
sleet
and
snow
.
<EOS>
on
the
morrow
one
could
hardly
imagine
that
there
have
be
three
week
of
summer
:
the
primrose
and
crocus
be
hide
under
wintry
drift
;
the
lark
be
silent
,
the
young
leave
of
the
early
tree
smitten
and
blacken
.
<EOS>
and
dreary
,
and
chill
,
and
dismal
,
that
morrow
do
creep
over
!
<EOS>
My
master
keep
his
room
;
I
take
possession
of
the
lonely
parlour
,
convert
it
into
a
nursery
:
<EOS>
and
there
I
be
,
sit
with
the
moan
doll
of
a
child
lay
on
my
knee
;
rock
it
to
and
fro
,
and
watch
,
meanwhile
,
the
still
drive
flake
build
up
the
uncurtained
window
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
some
person
enter
,
out
of
breath
and
laughing
!
<EOS>
My
anger
be
great
than
my
astonishment
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
one
of
the
maid
,
and
I
cry
 
"
have
do

<EOS>
how
dare
you
show
your
giddiness
here
;
what
would
Mr.
Linton
say
if

hear
you

<EOS>
"
excuse
me

answer
a

<EOS>
with
that
the
speaker
come
forward
to
the
fire
,
pant
and
hold
her
hand
to
her
side

"
I

Heights

after

there
shall
be
an

I

the
goodness
to
step
out
and
order
the

to

wardrobe

<EOS>
the
intruder
be
Mrs.
Heathcliff

She
certainly
seem
in
no
laugh
predicament

her
hair
stream
on
her
shoulder
,
drip
with
snow
and
water

she
be
dress
in
the
girlish
dress
she
commonly
wear
,
befit
her
age
more
than
her
position
:
a
low
frock

of
light
silk

clung
to
her
with
wet
,

her
foot

protect
merely
by
thin
slipper

add
to
this
a
deep
cut
under

only
the

prevent
from
bleed
profusely

a
white
face

hardly
able

itself
through
fatigue

you
may
fancy
my
first
fright
be
not
much
allay
when
I
have
have
leisure
to
examine
her

My

nowhere

nothing

remove
every

on
dry
thing

certainly
you

Gimmerton

night

no

dress
myself
decently

ah

see
how
it
flow
down
my

<EOS>
She
insist
on
my
fulfil
her
direction

would
let
me
touch
her
;

not
till
after
the
coachman
have
be
instruct
to
get
ready
,
and
a
maid
set
to
pack
up
some
necessary

down
opposite

poor
Catherine

away

it

You
must
not

little

I

for

not

out

I

halt
at

I
interrupt

disorder
the
handkerchief
I
have
tie
round
your

make

again

your

take
breath

over
laughing

<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
,

commit
it
to
a
servant

care

then
I
inquire
what
have
urge
her
to
escape
from
Wuthering
Heights
in
such
an
unlikely
plight

where
she
mean
to
go

<EOS>
"
I
ought

I
wish
to
remain

answer
she
,
"
to
cheer
Edgar

take
care
of
the
baby

for
two
thing
,

because
the

my
right
home

I
tell
you
he
would
not

me
!

do
you
think
he
could
bear
to
see
me
grow
fat
and
merry
 
could
bear
to
think
that
we
be
tranquil
,
and
not
resolve
on
poison
our
comfort

<EOS>
now
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
be
sure
that
he
detest
me
,
to
the
point
of
its
annoy
him
seriously
to
have
me
within
ear
-
shot
or
eyesight
:
<EOS>
I
notice
,
when
I
enter
his
presence
,
the
muscle
of
his
countenance
be
involuntarily
distort
into
an
expression
of
hatred
;
partly
arise
from
his
knowledge
of
the
good
cause
I
have
to
feel
that
sentiment
for
him
,
and
partly
from
original
aversion
.
<EOS>
It
be
strong
enough
to
make
me
feel
pretty
certain
that
he
would
not
chase
me
over
England
,
suppose
I
contrive
a
clear
escape
;
and
therefore
I
must
get
quite
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
recover
from
my
first
desire
to
be
kill
by
him
:
I
would
rather
he
would
kill
himself
!
<EOS>
He
have
extinguish
my
love
effectually
,
and
so
I
be
at
my
ease

<EOS>
I
can
recollect
yet
how
I
love
him
;
and
can
dimly
imagine
that
I
could
still
be
love
him
,
if
 
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
even
if
he
have
dote
on
me
,
the
devilish
nature
would
have
reveal
its
existence
somehow

Catherine

an
awfully
pervert
taste
to
esteem
him
so
dearly

him
so
well

out

give
him
my
heart

and
pinch
it
to
death

fling
it
back
to
me

People
feel
with
their
heart

Ellen

and
since
he
have
destroy
mine
,
I
have
not
power
to
feel
for
him
:
and
I
would
not
,
though
he
groan
from
this
to
his
die
day
,

weep
tear
of
blood
for
Catherine
!
<EOS>
no

indeed

You
ask
,
what
have
drive
me
to
flight
at
last

<EOS>
I
be
compel
to
attempt
it

because
I
have
succeed
in

his
rage
a
pitch
above
his
malignity

more
coolness

on
the

<EOS>
He
be
work
up
to
forget
the
fiendish
prudence
he
boast
of
,
and
proceed
to
murderous
violence
.
<EOS>
I
experience
pleasure
in

able
to
exasperate
him
:
the
sense
of
pleasure
wake
my
instinct
of
self

preservation

so
I
fairly
break
free
;

if
ever
I

welcome
to
a
signal
revenge

"
yesterday
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
should
have
be
at
the
funeral

<EOS>
He
keep
himself
sober
for
the
purpose
 
tolerably
sober
:
not
go
to
bed
mad
at
six
o'clock
and
get
up
drunk
at
twelve
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
he
rise
,
in
suicidal
low
spirit

as
fit
for
the
church
as
for
a
dance

instead

fire

tumblerful

Heathcliff

him

have
be
a
stranger
in

Sunday

day

whether
the
angel
have
feed
him

his
kin
beneath

I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
have
not
eat
a
meal
with
us
for
nearly
a
week
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
come
home
at
dawn
,
and
go
up
-
stair
to
his
chamber
;
lock
himself
in
 
as
if
anybody
dreamt
of
covet
his
company
!
<EOS>
there
he
have
continue
,
pray
like
a
Methodist
:
only
the
deity
he
implore
be
senseless
dust
and
ashe
;
and
God
,
when
address
,
be
curiously
confound
with
his
own
black
father

after
conclude
these
precious
orison

they
last
generally
till
he
grow
hoarse

his
voice
be
strangle
in
his
throat

he
would
be
off
again
;
always
straight
down
to
the
grange

I
wonder
Edgar
do
not
send
for
a
constable
,
and
give
him
into
custody
!
<EOS>
for
me

grieve
as
I
be
about
Catherine

it
be
impossible
to
avoid
regard
this
season
of
deliverance
from
degrade
oppression

a
holiday

"
I
recover
spirit
sufficient
to
bear
Joseph
's
eternal
lecture
without
weep
,
and
to
move
up
and
down
the
house
less
with
the
foot
of
a
frightened
thief
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
that
I
should
cry
at
anything
Joseph
could
say
;
but
he
and
Hareton
be
detestable
companion

<EOS>
I
would
rather
sit
with
Hindley

hear
his
awful
talk

with

little
maister

odious
old

I

often

to
seek

starve

be
not

He
be
quieter
now
than
he

be

no

more
sullen

depressed

furious

yester

evening
I
sit
in
my
nook
read
some
old
book

late
on
towards
twelve

<EOS>
It
seem
so
dismal
to
go
up
-
stair
,
with
the
wild
snow
blow
outside
,
and
my
thought
continually
revert
to
the
kirk

yard

the
new
-
make
grave

I
dare
hardly

melancholy

sit
opposite
,
his
head
leant
on
his
hand

perhaps
meditate
on
the
same
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
cease
drinking
at
a
point
below
irrationality
,
and
have
neither
stir
nor
speak
during
two
or
three
hour

there
be
no
sound
through
the
house

the
moan
wind

which
shake
the
window
every
now

then
,
the
faint
crackling
of
the
coal
,
and
the
click
of
my
snuffer
as
I
remove
at
interval
the
long
wick
of
the
candle

<EOS>
Hareton
and
Joseph
be
probably
fast
asleep
in
bed

It
be
very
,
very
sad
:
and
while
I
read
I
sigh
,
for
it
seem
as
if
all
joy
have
vanish
from
the
world

never

the
doleful
silence
be
break
at

by
the
sound

latch

Heathcliff

return
from

watch
earlier
than
usual
;
owing
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
sudden
storm

that
entrance
be
fasten

and
we
hear
him
come
round
to
get
in
by
the
other

I
rise
with
an
irrepressible
expression
of
what
I
feel
on
my
lip

which
induce
my

have
be
stare
towards

no

out

Earnshaw
accomplish
this
ere
his

front

he
then
come
and
bring
his
chair
to
the
other
side
of
my
table
,
lean
over
it
,
and
search
in
my
eye
for
a
sympathy
with
the
burn
hate
that
gleam
from
his
:
as
he
both
look
and
feel
like
an
assassin

he
could
not
exactly
find
that
;

he
discover
enough
to

him
to
speak

You

Mrs.

,
I
will
ask
you
to
do
nothing
;
but
sit
still
and
be
dumb
.
<EOS>
tell
me
now
,
can
you
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
have
as
much
pleasure
as
I
in
witness
the
conclusion
of
the
fiend
's
existence
;
he
will
be
_
your

death
unless
you
overreach
him

leave
me

with
that
I
shut
the
window

return
to
my

by
the
fire
;
have
too
small
a
stock
of
hypocrisy
at
my
command
to
pretend
any
anxiety
for
the
danger
that
menace
him
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
swear
passionately
at
me
:
affirm
that
I
love
the
villain
yet
;

call
me
all
sort
of
name
for
the
base
spirit
I
evince
.

and
I
,
in
my
secret
heart
(
and

never
reproach
me

,
think
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
for

him

Heathcliff

him
out

send
Heathcliff
to

bang
on

close

His

be
whiten
with

by
cold
and

gleam
through

phraseology

steadily
conclude
his
supplication

then
rise

vow
he
would
set
off
for
the
Grange
directly

<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
be
a
magistrate
,
and
though
he
have
fifty
wife
dead
,
he
should
inquire
into
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
obstinate
in
his
resolution
,
that
Heathcliff
deem
it
expedient
to
compel
from
my
lip
a
recapitulation
of
what
have
take
place
;
stand
over
me
,
heave
with
malevolence
,
as
I
reluctantly
deliver
the
account
in
answer
to
his
question
.
<EOS>
It
require
a
great
deal
of
labour
to
satisfy
the
old
man
that
Heathcliff
be
not
the
aggressor
;
especially
with
my
hardly
-
wrung
reply
.
<EOS>
however
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
soon
convince
him
that
he
be
alive
still
;
Joseph
hasten
to
administer
a
dose
of
spirit
,
and
by
their
succour
his
master
presently
regain
motion
and
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
,
aware
that
his
opponent
be
ignorant
of
the
treatment
receive
while
insensible
,
call
him
deliriously
intoxicate
;
and
say
he
should
not
notice
his
atrocious
conduct
further
,
but
advise
him
to
get
to
bed
.
<EOS>
to
my
joy
,
he
leave
us
,
after
give
this
judicious
counsel
,
and
Hindley
stretch
himself
on
the
hearthstone
.

I
depart
to
my
own
room
,
marvel
that
I
have
escape
so
easily

<EOS>
"
this
morning
,
when
I
come
down
,
about
half
an
hour
before
noon
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
be
sit
by
the
fire
,
deadly
sick
;
his
evil
genius
,
almost
as
gaunt
and
ghastly
,
leant
against
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
neither
appear
inclined
to
dine
,
and
,
have
wait
till
all
be
cold
on
the
table
,
I
commence
alone
.
<EOS>
nothing
hinder
me
from
eat
heartily
,
and
I
experience
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
and
superiority
,
as
,
at
interval
,
I
cast
a
look
towards
my
silent
companion
,
and
feel
the
comfort
of
a
quiet
conscience
within
me
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
do
,
I
venture
on
the
unusual
liberty
of
draw
near
the
fire
,
go
round
Earnshaw
's
seat
,
and
kneel
in
the
corner
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heathcliff
do
not
glance
my
way
,
and
I
gaze
up
,
and
contemplate
his
feature
almost
as
confidently
as
if
they
have
be
turn
to
stone
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
that
I
once
think
so
manly
,
and
that
I
now
think
so
diabolical
,
be
shade
with
a
heavy
cloud
;
his
basilisk
eye
be
nearly
quench
by
sleeplessness
,
and
weeping
,
perhaps
,
for
the
lash
<EOS>
be
wet
then
:
his
lip
devoid
of
their
ferocious
sneer
,
and
seal
in
an
expression
of
unspeakable
sadness
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
another
,
I
would
have
cover
my
face
in
the
presence
of
such
grief
.
<EOS>
in
_
his
_
case
,
I
be
gratify
;
and
,
ignoble
as
it
seem
to
insult
a
fall
enemy
,
I
could
not
miss
this
chance
of
stick
in
a
dart
:
<EOS>
his
weakness
be
the
only
time
when
I
could
taste
the
delight
of
pay
wrong
for
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fie
,
fie
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
interrupt

<EOS>

one
may
suppose
you
have
never
open
a
Bible
in
your
life

<EOS>
if
God
afflict
your
enemy
,
surely
that
ought
to
suffice
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
both
mean
and
presumptuous
to
add
your
torture
to
his
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
general
I
will
allow
that
it
would
be
,
Ellen
,
"
she
continue
;
"
but
what
misery
lay
on
Heathcliff
could
content
me
,
unless
I
have
a
hand
in
it
?
<EOS>
I
would
<EOS>
rather
he
suffer
less
,
if
I
may
cause
his
suffering
and
<EOS>
he
may
_
know
_
that
I
be
the
cause
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
owe
him
so
much
.
<EOS>
on
only
one
condition
can
I
hope
to
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
if
I
may
take
an
eye
for
an
eye
,
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
;
for
every
wrench
of
agony
return
a
wrench
:
reduce
him
to
my
level
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
the
first
to
injure
,
make
him
the
first
to
implore
pardon
;
and
then
 
why
then
,
Ellen
,
I
may
show
you
some
generosity
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
utterly
impossible
I
can
ever
be
revenge
,
and
therefore
I
can
not
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
Hindley
want
some
water
,
and
I
hand
him
a
glass
,
and
ask
him
how
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
not
as
ill
as
I
wish

he
reply
.
"
<EOS>
but
leave
out
my
arm

every
inch
of
me
be
as
sore
as
if
I
have

fight
with
a
legion
of
imp

yes

my
next
remark

Catherine
use
to
boast
that

for

eye
rain
down

among

his

pull
it
out

another

I

Isabella
cease
speak

and
take
a
drink
of
tea
;
then
she
rise

and
bid
me
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
a
great
shawl
I
have
bring
,
and
turn
a
deaf

She
be
drive
away

never

revisit
this
neighbourhood
:
but
a
regular
correspondence
be
establish
between
her
and
my
master
when
thing
be
more
settle
.
<EOS>
I
believe
her
new
abode
be
in
the
south
,
near
London
;
there
she
have
a
son
bear
a
few
month
subsequent
to
her
escape

He
be
christen
Linton

and
,
from
the
first
,
she
report
him
to
be
an
ailing
,
peevish
creature
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
meet
me
one
day
in
the
village
,
inquire
where
she
live
.
<EOS>
I
refuse
to
tell
.
<EOS>
He
remark
that
it
be
not
of
any
moment
,
only
she
must
beware
of
come
to
her
brother
:
she
should
not
be
with
him
,
if
he
have
to
keep
her
himself
.
<EOS>
though
I
would
give
no
information
,
he
discover
,
through
some
of
the
other
servant
,
both
her
place
of
residence
and
the
existence
of
the
child
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
do
not
molest
her
:
for
which
forbearance
she
may
thank
his
aversion
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
often
ask
about
the
infant
,
when
he
see
me
;
and
on
hear
its
name
,
smile
grimly
,
and
observe
:
"
They
wish
me
to
hate
it
too
,
do
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
they
wish
you
to
know
anything

it

I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
have
it
,
"
he
say
,
"
when
I
want
it
.
<EOS>
They
may
reckon
on
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
fortunately
its
mother
die
before
the
time
arrive
;
some
thirteen
year
after
the
decease
of
Catherine
,
when
Linton
be
twelve
,
or
a
little
more
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
succeed
Isabella
's
unexpected
visit
I
have
no
opportunity
of
speak
to
my
master
:
he
shun
conversation
,
and
be
fit
for
discuss
nothing
.
<EOS>
when
I
could
get
him
to
listen
,
I
see
it
please
him
that
his
sister
have
leave
her
husband
;
whom
he
abhor
with
an
intensity
which
the
mildness
of
his
nature
would
scarcely
seem
to
allow
.
<EOS>
so
deep
and
sensitive
be
his
aversion
,
that
he
refrain
from
go
anywhere
where
he
be
likely
to
see
or
hear
of
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Grief
,
and
that
together
,
transform
him
into
a
complete
hermit
:
he
throw
up
his
office
of
magistrate
,
cease
even
to
attend
church
,
avoid
the
village
on
all
occasion
,
and
spend
a
life
of
entire
seclusion
within
the
limit
of
his
park
and
ground
;
only
vary
by
solitary
ramble
on
the
moor
,
and
visit
to
the
grave
of
his
wife
,
mostly
at
evening
,
or
early
morning
before
other
wanderer
be
abroad
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
good
to
be
thoroughly
unhappy
long
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
do
not
pray
for
Catherine
's
soul
to
haunt
him
.
<EOS>
time
bring
resignation
,
and
a
melancholy
sweet
than
common
joy
.
<EOS>
He
recall
her
memory
with
ardent
,
tender
love
,
and
hopeful
aspire
to
the
well
world
;
where
he
doubt
not
she
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
have
earthly
consolation
and
affection
also
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
day
,
I
say
,
he
seem
regardless
of
the
puny
successor
to
the
depart
:
that
coldness
melt
as
fast
as
snow
in
April
,
and
ere
the
tiny
thing
could
stammer
a
word
or
totter
a
step
<EOS>
it
wield
a
despot
's
sceptre
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
It
be
name
Catherine
;
but
he
never
call
it
the
name
in
full
,
as
he
have
never
call
the
first
Catherine
short
:
probably
because
Heathcliff
have
a
habit
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
little
one
be
always
Cathy
:
<EOS>
it
form
to
him
a
distinction
from
the
mother
,
and
yet
a
connection
with
her
;
and
his
attachment
spring
from
its
relation
to
her
,
far
more
than
from
its
be
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
to
draw
a
comparison
between
him
and
Hindley
Earnshaw
,
and
perplex
myself
to
explain
satisfactorily
why
their
conduct
be
so
opposite
in
similar
circumstance
.
<EOS>
They
have
both
be
fond
husband
,
and
be
both
attach
to
their
child
;
and
I
could
not
see
how
they
should
not
both
have
take
the
same
road
,
for
good
or
evil
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
think
in
my
mind
,
Hindley
,
with
apparently
the
strong
head
,
have
show
himself
sadly
the
bad
and
the
weak
man
.
<EOS>
when
his
ship
strike
,
the
captain
abandon
his
post
;
and
the
crew
,
instead
of
try
to
save
her
,
rush
into
riot
and
confusion
,
leave
no
hope
for
their
luckless
vessel
.
<EOS>
Linton
,
on
the
contrary
,
display
the
true
courage
of
a
loyal
and
faithful
soul
:
he
trust
God
;
and
God
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
one
hope
,
and
the
other
despaired
:
<EOS>
they
choose
their
own
lot
,
and
be
righteously
doom
to
endure
them
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
not
want
to
hear
my
moralising
,
Mr.
Lockwood
;
you
will
judge
,
as
well
as
I
can
,
all
these
thing
:
at
least
,
you
will
think
you
will
,
and
that
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
Earnshaw
be
what
may
have
be
expect
;
it
follow
fast
on
his
sister
's
:
there
be
scarcely
six
month
between
them
.
<EOS>
We
,
at
the
grange
,
never
get
a
very
succinct
account
of
his
state
precede
it
;
all
that
I
do
learn
be
on
occasion
of
go
to
aid
in
the
preparation
for
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
come
to
announce
the
event
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
nelly
,
"
say
he
,
ride
into
the
yard
one
morning
,
too
early
not
to
alarm
me
with
an
instant
presentiment
of
bad
news
,
"
it
be
yours
and
my
turn
to
go
into
mourning
at
present
.

who
be
give
us
the
slip
now
,
do
you
think
?

<EOS>

who
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
in
a
flurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
guess
!

<EOS>
he
return
,
dismount
,
and
sling
his
bridle
on
a
hook
by
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
and
nip
up
the
corner
of
your
apron
<EOS>
:
I
be
certain
you
will
need
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
would
you
have
tear
for
him
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
Heathcliff
's
a
tough
young
fellow
<EOS>
:
he
look
bloom
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
rapidly
regain
flesh
since
he
lose
his
well
half
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
,
then
,
Mr.
Kenneth
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hindley
Earnshaw
!
<EOS>
Your
old
friend
Hindley
,
"
he
reply
,
"
and
my
wicked
gossip
:
though
he
be
be
too
wild
for
me
this
long
while
.
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
I
say
we
should
draw
water
.
<EOS>
but
cheer
up
!
<EOS>
He
die
true
to
his
character
:
drunk
as
a
lord
.
<EOS>
poor
lad
!
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
,
too
.
<EOS>
one
can
not
help
miss
an
old
companion
:
though
he
have
the
bad
trick
with
him
that
ever
man
imagine
,
and
have
do
me
many
a
rascally
turn
.
<EOS>
He
be
barely
twenty
-
seven
<EOS>
,
it
seem
;
that
be
your
own
age
:
who
would
have
think
you
be
bear
in
one
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
confess
this
blow
be
great
to
me
than
the
shock
of
Mrs.
Linton
's
death
:
ancient
association
linger
round
my
heart
;
I
sit
down
in
the
porch
and
weep
as
for
a
blood
relation
,
desire
Mr.
Kenneth
to
get
another
servant
to
introduce
him
to
the
master
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
hinder
myself
from
ponder
on
the
question
 
<EOS>
"
have
he
have
fair
play
?
<EOS>
"
whatever
I
do
,
that
idea
would
bother
me
:
it
be
so
tiresomely
pertinacious
that
I
resolve
on
request
leave
to
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
assist
in
the
last
duty
to
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
be
extremely
reluctant
to
consent
,
but
I
plead
eloquently
for
the
friendless
condition
in
which
he
lie
;
and
I
say
my
old
master
and
foster
-
brother
have
a
claim
on
my
service
as
strong
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
remind
him
that
the
child
Hareton
be
his
wife
's
nephew
,
and
,
in
the
absence
of
nearer
kin
,
he
ought
to
act
as
its
guardian
;
and
he
ought
to
and
must
inquire
how
the
property
be
leave
,
and
look
over
the
concern
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
be
unfit
for
attend
to
such
matter
then
,
but
he
bid
me
speak
to
his
lawyer
;
and
at
length
permit
me
to
go
.
<EOS>
His
lawyer
have
be
Earnshaw
's
also
:
I
call
at
the
village
,
and
ask
him
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
,
and
advise
that
Heathcliff
should
be
let
alone
;
affirm
,
if
the
truth
be
know
,
Hareton
would
be
find
little
else
than
a
beggar
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
father
die
in
debt
,
"
he
say
;
"
the
whole
property
be
mortgage
,
and
the
sole
chance
for
the
natural
heir
be
to
allow
him
an
opportunity
of
create
some
interest
in
the
creditor
's
heart
,
that
he
may
be
incline
to
deal
leniently
towards
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
reach
the
Heights
,
I
explain
that
I
have
come
to
see
everything
carry
on
decently
;
and
Joseph
,
who
appear
in
sufficient
distress
,
express
satisfaction
at
my
presence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
say
he
do
not
perceive
that
I
be
want
;
but
I
may
stay
and
order
the
arrangement
for
the
funeral
,
if
I
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
correctly
,
"
he
remark
,
"
that
fool
's
body
should
be
bury
at
the
cross
-
road
,
without
ceremony
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
leave
him
ten
minute
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
in
that
interval
he
fasten
the
two
door
of
the
house
against
me
,
and
he
have
spend
the
night
in
drink
himself
to
death
deliberately
!
<EOS>
We
break
in
this
morning
,
for
we
hear
him
sport
like
a
horse
;
and
there
he
be
,
lay
over
the
settle
:
flay
and
scalping
would
not
have
waken
him
.
<EOS>
I
send
for
Kenneth
,
and
he
come
;
but
not
till
the
beast
have
change
into
carrion
<EOS>
:
he
be
both
dead
and
cold
,
and
stark
;
and
so
you
will
allow
it
be
useless
make
more
stir
about
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
servant
confirm
this
statement
,
but
mutter
:
  
"
I
would
rayther
he
would
goan
hisseln
for
t
'
doctor
!
<EOS>
I
sud
ha
'
taen
tent
o
'
t
'
maister
better
nor
him
 
and
he
warn't
<EOS>
deead
when
I
leave
<EOS>
,
naught
o
'
t
'
soart
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
insist
on
the
funeral
be
respectable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
say
I
may
have
my
own
way
there
too
:
only
,
he
desire
me
to
remember
that
the
money
for
the
whole
affair
come
out
of
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
maintain
a
hard
,
careless
deportment
,
indicative
of
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
:
if
anything
,
it
express
a
flinty
gratification
at
a
piece
of
difficult
work
successfully
execute
.
<EOS>
I
observe
once
,
indeed
,
something
like
exultation
in
his
aspect
:
it
be
just
when
the
people
be
bear
the
coffin
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
hypocrisy
to
represent
a
mourner
:
and
previous
to
follow
with
Hareton
,
he
lift
the
unfortunate
child
on
to
the
table
and
mutter
,
with
peculiar
gusto
,
"
now
,
my
bonny
lad
,
you
be
_
mine
_
!
<EOS>
and
we
will
see
if
one
tree
will
not
grow
as
crooked
as
another
,
with
the
same
wind
to
twist
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
unsuspecting
thing
be
pleased
at
this
speech
:
he
play
with
Heathcliff
's
whisker
,
and
stroke
his
cheek
;
but
I
divine
its
meaning
,
and
observe
tartly
,
"
that
boy
must
go
back
with
me
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
sir
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
less
your
than
he
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Linton
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
he
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
 
he
have
order
me
to
take
him
,
"
I
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
scoundrel
,
"
we
will
not
argue
the
subject
now
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
fancy
to
try
my
hand
at
rear
a
young
one
;
so
intimate
to
your
master
that
I
must
supply
the
place
of
this
with
my
own
,
if
he
attempt
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
engage
to
let
Hareton
go
undisputed
;
but
I
will
be
pretty
sure
to
make
the
other
come
!
<EOS>
remember
to
tell
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
hint
be
enough
to
bind
our
hand
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
its
substance
on
my
return
;
and
Edgar
Linton
,
little
interested
at
the
commencement
,
speak
no
more
of
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
that
he
could
have
do
it
to
any
purpose
,
have
he
be
ever
so
willing
.
  
<EOS>
the
guest
be
now
the
master
of
Wuthering
Heights
:
he
hold
firm
possession
,
and
prove
to
the
attorney
 
who
,
in
his
turn
,
prove
it
to
Mr.
Linton
 
that
Earnshaw
have
mortgage
every
yard
of
land
he
own
for
cash
to
supply
his
mania
for
gaming
;
and
he
,
Heathcliff
,
be
the
mortgagee
.
<EOS>
in
that
manner
Hareton
,
who
should
now
be
the
first
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
be
reduce
to
a
state
of
complete
dependence
on
his
father
's
inveterate
enemy
;
and
live
in
his
own
house
as
a
servant
,
deprive
of
the
advantage
of
wage
:
quite
unable
to
right
himself
,
because
of
his
friendlessness
,
and
his
ignorance
that
he
have
be
wrong
.
    
<EOS>
the
twelve
year
,
continue
Mrs.
Dean
,
follow
that
dismal
period
be
the
happy
of
my
life
:
my
great
trouble
in
their
passage
rise
from
our
little
lady
's
trifling
illness
,
which
she
have
to
experience
in
common
with
all
child
,
rich
and
poor
.
<EOS>
for
the
rest
,
after
the
first
six
month
,
she
grow
like
a
larch
,
and
could
walk
and
talk
too
,
in
her
own
way
,
before
the
heath
blossom
a
second
time
over
Mrs.
Linton
's
dust
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
most
win
thing
that
ever
bring
sunshine
into
a
desolate
house
:
a
real
beauty
in
face
,
with
the
Earnshaws
'
handsome
dark
eye
,
but
the
linton
'
fair
skin
and
small
feature
,
and
yellow
curl
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
be
high
,
though
not
rough
,
and
qualify
by
a
heart
sensitive
and
lively
to
excess
in
its
affection
.
<EOS>
that
capacity
for
intense
attachment
remind
me
of
her
mother
:
still
she
do
not
resemble
her
:
<EOS>
for
she
could
be
soft
and
mild
as
a
dove
,
and
she
have
a
gentle
voice
and
pensive
expression
:
her
anger
be
never
furious
;
her
love
never
fierce
<EOS>
:
it
be
deep
and
tender
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
,
she
have
fault
to
foil
her
gift
.
<EOS>
a
propensity
to
be
saucy
be
one
;
and
a
perverse
will
,
that
indulge
child
invariably
acquire
,
whether
they
be
good
temper
or
cross
.
<EOS>
if
a
servant
chance
to
vex
her
,
it
be
always
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
papa
!
"
<EOS>
and
if
he
reprove
her
,
even
by
a
look
,
you
would
have
think
it
a
heart
-
break
business
<EOS>
:
I
do
not
believe
he
ever
do
speak
a
harsh
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
take
her
education
entirely
on
himself
,
and
make
it
an
amusement
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
curiosity
and
a
quick
intellect
make
her
an
apt
scholar
:
she
learn
rapidly
and
eagerly
,
and
do
honour
to
his
teaching
.
  
<EOS>
till
she
reach
the
age
of
thirteen
<EOS>
she
have
not
once
be
beyond
the
range
of
the
park
by
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
would
take
her
with
him
a
mile
or
so
outside
,
on
rare
occasion
;
but
he
trust
her
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
Gimmerton
be
an
unsubstantial
name
in
her
ear
;
the
chapel
,
the
only
building
she
have
approach
or
enter
,
except
her
own
home
.
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
do
not
exist
for
her
:
she
be
a
perfect
recluse
;
and
,
apparently
,
perfectly
content
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
while
survey
the
country
from
her
nursery
window
,
she
would
observe
    
"
Ellen
<EOS>
,
how
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
walk
to
the
top
of
those
hill
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
lie
on
the
other
side
 
be
it
the
sea
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
Miss
Cathy
,
"
I
would
answer
;
"
it
be
hill
again
,
just
like
these
.
"
  
"
and
what
be
those
golden
rock
like
<EOS>
when
you
stand
under
them
?
<EOS>
"
she
once
ask
.
  
<EOS>
the
abrupt
descent
of
Penistone
Crags
particularly
attract
her
notice
;
especially
when
the
set
sun
shine
on
it
and
the
topmost
height
,
and
the
whole
extent
of
landscape
besides
lie
in
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
explain
that
they
be
bare
masse
of
stone
,
with
hardly
enough
earth
in
their
cleft
to
nourish
a
stunted
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
be
they
bright
so
long
after
it
be
evening
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
pursue
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
they
be
a
great
deal
higher
up
than
we
be
,
"
reply
I
;
"
you
could
not
climb
them
,
they
be
too
high
and
steep
.
<EOS>
in
winter
the
frost
be
always
there
before
it
come
to
us
;
and
deep
into
summer
I
have
find
snow
under
that
black
hollow
on
the
north
-
east
side
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
have
be
on
them
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
gleefully
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
can
go
,
too
,
when
I
be
a
woman
.
<EOS>
have
papa
be
,
Ellen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
would
tell
you
,
Miss
,
"
I
answer
,
hastily
,
"
that
they
be
not
worth
the
trouble
of
visit
.
<EOS>
the
moor
,
where
you
ramble
with
him
,
be
much
nice
;
and
Thrushcross
Park
be
the
fine
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
know
the
park
,
and
I
do
not
know
those
,
"
she
murmur
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
delight
to
look
round
me
from
the
brow
of
that
tall
point
:
my
little
pony
Minny
shall
take
me
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
maid
mention
the
Fairy
Cave
,
quite
turn
her
head
with
a
desire
to
fulfil
this
project
:
she
tease
Mr.
Linton
about
it
;
and
he
promise
she
should
have
the
journey
when
she
get
old
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Catherine
measure
her
age
by
month
,
and
,
"
now
,
be
I
old
enough
to
go
to
Penistone
Crags
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
constant
question
in
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
road
thither
wind
close
by
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
Edgar
have
not
the
heart
to
pass
it
;
so
she
receive
as
constantly
the
answer
,
"
not
yet
,
love
:
not
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
Mrs.
Heathcliff
live
above
a
dozen
year
after
quit
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
family
be
of
a
delicate
constitution
:
she
and
Edgar
both
lack
the
ruddy
health
that
you
will
generally
meet
in
these
part
.
<EOS>
what
her
last
illness
be
,
I
be
not
certain
:
<EOS>
I
conjecture
,
they
die
of
the
same
thing
,
a
kind
of
fever
,
slow
at
its
commencement
,
but
incurable
,
and
rapidly
consume
life
towards
the
close
.
<EOS>
She
write
to
inform
her
brother
of
the
probable
conclusion
of
a
four
-
month
'
indisposition
under
which
she
have
suffer
,
and
entreat
him
to
come
to
her
,
if
possible
;
for
she
have
much
to
settle
,
and
she
wish
to
bid
him
adieu
,
and
deliver
Linton
safely
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
hope
be
that
Linton
may
be
leave
with
him
,
as
he
have
be
with
her
:
his
father
,
she
would
fain
convince
herself
,
have
no
desire
to
assume
the
burden
of
his
maintenance
or
education
.
<EOS>
My
master
hesitate
not
a
moment
in
comply
with
her
request
:
<EOS>
reluctant
as
he
be
to
leave
home
at
ordinary
call
,
he
fly
to
answer
this
;
command
Catherine
to
my
peculiar
vigilance
,
in
his
absence
,
with
reiterated
order
that
she
must
not
wander
out
of
the
park
,
even
under
my
escort
he
do
not
calculate
on
her
go
unaccompanied
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
away
three
week
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
or
two
my
charge
sit
in
a
corner
of
the
library
,
too
sad
for
either
reading
or
playing
:
in
that
quiet
state
she
cause
me
little
trouble
;
but
it
be
succeed
by
an
interval
of
impatient
,
fretful
weariness
;
and
be
too
busy
,
and
too
old
then
,
to
run
up
and
down
amuse
her
<EOS>
,
I
hit
on
a
method
by
which
she
may
entertain
herself
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
send
her
on
her
travel
round
the
ground
 
now
on
foot
,
and
now
on
a
pony
;
indulge
her
with
a
patient
audience
of
all
her
real
and
imaginary
adventure
when
she
return
.
  
<EOS>
the
summer
shine
in
full
prime
;
and
she
take
such
a
taste
for
this
solitary
rambling
that
she
often
contrive
to
remain
out
from
breakfast
till
tea
;
and
then
the
evening
be
spend
in
recount
her
fanciful
tale
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
fear
her
break
bound
;
because
the
gate
be
generally
lock
,
and
I
think
she
would
scarcely
venture
forth
alone
,
if
they
have
stand
wide
open
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
my
confidence
prove
misplace
.
<EOS>
Catherine
come
to
me
,
one
morning
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
say
she
be
that
day
an
arabian
merchant
,
go
to
cross
the
Desert
with
his
caravan
;
and
I
must
give
her
plenty
of
provision
for
herself
and
beast
:
a
horse
,
and
three
camel
,
personate
by
a
large
hound
and
a
couple
of
pointer
.
<EOS>
I
get
together
good
store
of
dainty
,
and
sling
them
in
a
basket
on
one
side
of
the
saddle
;
and
she
spring
up
as
gay
as
a
fairy
,
shelter
by
her
wide
-
brim
hat
and
gauze
veil
from
the
July
sun
,
and
trot
off
with
a
merry
laugh
,
mock
my
cautious
counsel
to
avoid
galloping
,
and
come
back
early
.
<EOS>
the
naughty
thing
never
make
her
appearance
at
tea
.
<EOS>
one
traveller
,
the
hound
,
be
an
old
dog
and
fond
of
its
ease
,
return
;
but
neither
Cathy
,
nor
the
pony
,
nor
the
two
pointer
be
visible
in
any
direction
:
I
despatch
emissary
down
this
path
,
and
that
path
,
and
at
last
go
wander
in
search
of
her
myself
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
labourer
work
at
a
fence
round
a
plantation
,
on
the
border
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
inquire
of
him
if
he
have
see
our
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
her
at
morn
,
"
he
reply
:
"
she
would
have
me
to
cut
her
a
hazel
switch
,
and
then
she
leap
her
Galloway
over
the
hedge
yonder
,
where
it
be
low
,
and
gallop
out
of
sight
.
"
  
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
I
feel
at
hear
this
news
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
directly
she
must
have
start
for
Penistone
Crags
.
<EOS>
"
what
will
become
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculate
,
push
through
a
gap
which
the
man
be
repair
,
and
make
straight
to
the
high
-
road
.
<EOS>
I
walk
as
if
for
a
wager
,
mile
after
mile
,
till
a
turn
bring
me
in
view
of
the
Heights
;
but
no
Catherine
could
I
detect
,
far
or
near
.
<EOS>
the
Crags
lie
about
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
place
,
and
that
be
four
from
the
grange
,
so
I
begin
to
fear
night
would
fall
ere
<EOS>
I
could
reach
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
if
she
should
have
slip
in
clamber
among
them
,
"
I
reflect
,
"
and
be
kill
,
or
break
some
of
her
bone
?
<EOS>
"
My
suspense
be
truly
painful
;
and
,
at
first
,
it
give
me
delightful
relief
to
observe
,
in
hurrying
by
the
farmhouse
,
Charlie
,
the
fierce
of
the
pointer
,
lie
under
a
window
,
with
swelled
head
and
bleed
ear
.
<EOS>
I
open
the
wicket
and
run
to
the
door
,
knock
vehemently
for
admittance
.
<EOS>
a
woman
whom
I
know
,
and
who
formerly
live
at
Gimmerton
,
answer
:
she
have
be
servant
there
since
the
death
of
Mr.
Earnshaw
.

she

do
not

<EOS>
She

I
be
glad

"
  
<EOS>

He
be
not
at
home
then
,
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
I
pant
,
quite
breathless
with
quick
walking
and
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

"
she
reply
:
"
both
he
and
Joseph

off

and
I
think
they
will
not

this
hour
or
more

<EOS>
step
in
and
rest
you
a
bit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
enter
,
and
beheld
my
stray
lamb
seat
on
the
hearth
,
rock
herself
in
a
little
chair
that
have
be
her
mother
's
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
Her
hat
be
hang
against
the
wall
,
and
she
seem
perfectly
at
home
,
laugh
and
chattering
,
in
the
good
spirit
imaginable
,
to
Hareton
 
now
a
great
,
strong
lad
of
eighteen
 
who
stare
at
her
with
considerable
curiosity
and
astonishment
:
<EOS>
comprehend
precious
little
of
the
fluent
succession
of
remark
and
question
which
her
tongue
never
cease
pour
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
conceal
my
joy
under
an
angry
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
your
last
ride
,
till
papa
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
trust
you
over
the
threshold
again
,
you
naughty
,
naughty
girl

<EOS>
"
Aha
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
gaily
,
jump
up
and
run
to
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
a
pretty
story
to
tell
to

night
;
and
so
you

find
me
out

<EOS>
have
you
ever

here
in
your
life
before

<EOS>
"
  
"
put
that
hat
on
,
and
home
at
once
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
be
dreadfully
grieve
at
you
,
Miss
Cathy
:
you
have
do
extremely
wrong
!
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
pouting
and
cry
:
that
will
not
repay
the
trouble
I
have
have
,
scour
the
country
after
you
.
<EOS>
to
think
how
Mr.
Linton
charge
me
to
keep
you
in
;
and
you
steal
off
so
!
<EOS>
It
show
you
be
a
cunning
little
fox
,
and
nobody
will
put
faith
in
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
I
do
?

sob
she
,
instantly
check
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
charge
me
nothing

he

I

I

us

<EOS>
oh
,
for
shame
!
<EOS>
You
thirteen
year
old
,
and
such
a
baby
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
exclamation
be
cause
by
her
push
the
hat
from
her
head
,
and
retreat
to
the
chimney
out
of
my
reach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
the
servant
,
"
do
not
be
hard
on
the
bonny
lass
,
Mrs.
Dean
.
<EOS>
We
make
her
stop
:
she
would
fain
have
ride
forwards
,
afeard
you
should
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Hareton
offer
to
go
with
her
,
and
I
think
he
should
:
it
be
a
wild
road
over
the
hill
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
,
during
the
discussion
,
stand
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
too
awkward
to
speak
;
though
he
look
as
if
he
do
not
relish
my
intrusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
be
I
to
wait
?
<EOS>
"
I
continue
,
disregard
the
woman
's
interference
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
dark
in
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
where
be
the
pony
,
Miss
Cathy
?
<EOS>
and
where
be
Phoenix
?
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you

unless
you
be
quick

so
please
yourself

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
pony
be
in
the
yard
,

she
reply
,
"
and
Phoenix
be
shut
in
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
bite
 
and
so
be
Charlie
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
tell
you
all
about
it
;
but
you
be
in
a
bad
temper
,
and
do
not
deserve
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
pick
up
her
hat
,
and
approach
to
reinstate
it
;
but
perceive
that
the
people
of
the
house
take
her
part
,
she
commence
caper
round
the
room
;
and
on
my
give
chase
,
run
like
a
mouse
over
and
under
and
behind
the
furniture
,
render
it
ridiculous
for
me
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
Hareton
and
the
woman
laugh
,
and
she
join
them
,
and
wax
more
impertinent
still
;
till
I
cry
,
in
great
irritation
,
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Cathy
,
if
you
be
aware
whose
house
this
be
you
would
be
glad
enough
to
get
out
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
It

be
not
it

"
<EOS>
say
she
,
turn
to
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
he
reply
,
look
down
,
and
blush
bashfully
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
stand
a
steady
gaze
from
her
eye
,
though
they
be
just
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whose
then
 
your
master
's
?
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
colour
deeper
,
with
a
different
feeling
,
mutter
an
oath
,
and
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
his
master
?
<EOS>
"
continue
the
tiresome
girl
,
appeal
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
talk
about
"
our
house
,
"
and
"
our
folk
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
have
be
the
owner
's
son
.
<EOS>
and
he
never
say
Miss
:
he
should
have
do
,
should
not
he
,
if
he
be
a
servant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
grow
black
as
a
thunder
-
cloud
at
this
childish
speech
.
<EOS>
I
silently
shake
my
questioner
,
and
at
last
succeed
in
equip
her
for
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
get
my
horse
,
"
she
say
,
address
her
unknown
kinsman
as
she
would
one
of
the
stable

boy
at
the
Grange
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
may
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
where
the
goblin
-
hunter
rise
in
the
marsh
,
and
to
hear
about
the
_
fairishe

you
call

make
haste

<EOS>
what
be
the
matter

<EOS>
get
my
horse

"
You

ask
Catherine
in
surprise

<EOS>
"

<EOS>

there

you
see
you
have

into
pretty
company

nice

not

come

us
seek
for
Minny

<EOS>

but
,
Ellen

cry
she
,
stare
fix
in
astonishment
,

how
dare
he
speak
so

Must
not

<EOS>
You
wicke
creature

I

tell

now
,
then
!

<EOS>
Hareton
do
not
appear
to
feel
this
threat
;
so
the
tear
spring
into
her
eye
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
You
bring
the
pony
,
"
she
exclaim
,
turn
to
the
woman
,

and
let
my
dog
free
this
moment

softly

Miss

answer
she
address
;

you

lose
nothing

civil

<EOS>
though
Mr.

Cathy

with
a
scornful
laugh

respond
her
reprover

<EOS>
"
oh
,
Ellen

do
not

such

she
pursue
in
great
trouble

<EOS>
"
Papa

go
to
fetch
my
cousin
from
London
:
my
cousin
be
a
gentleman
's
son

<EOS>
that
my
 
"
she
stop
,
and
weep
outright
;
upset
at
the
bare
notion
of
relationship
with
such
a
clown
.
  
<EOS>
"
hush
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
I
whisper
;
"
people
can
have
many
cousin
and
of
all
sort
,
Miss
Cathy
,
without
be
any
the
bad
for
it
;
only
they
need
not
keep
their
company
,
if
they
be
disagreeable
and
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
my
cousin
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
"
she
go
on
,
gather
fresh
grief
from
reflection
,
and
fling
herself
into
my
arm
for
refuge
from
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
vexed
at
her
and
the
servant
for
their
mutual
revelation
;
have
no
doubt
of
Linton
's
approach
arrival
,
communicate
by
the
former
,
be
report
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
and
feel
as
confident
that
Catherine
's
first
thought
on
her
father
's
return
would
be
to
seek
an
explanation
of
the
latter
's
assertion
concern
her
rude
-
breed
kindre
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
recover
from
his
disgust
at
be
take
for
a
servant
,
seem
move
by
her
distress
;
and
,
have
fetch
the
pony
round
to
the
door
,
he
take
,
to
propitiate
her
,
a
fine
crooked
-
legged
terrier
whelp
from
the
kennel
,
and
put
it
into
her
hand
,
bid
her
whist
!
<EOS>
for
he
mean
nought
.
<EOS>
pause
in
her
lamentation
,
she
survey
him
with
a
glance
of
awe
and
horror
,
then
burst
forth
anew
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
refrain
from
smile
at
this
antipathy
to
the
poor
fellow
;
who
be
a
well
-
make
,
athletic
youth
,
good
-
look
in
feature
,
and
stout
and
healthy
,
but
attire
in
garment
befit
his
daily
occupation
of
work
on
the
farm
and
lounge
among
the
moor
after
rabbit
and
game
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
think
I
could
detect
in
his
physiognomy
a
mind
own
well
quality
than
his
father
ever
possess
.
<EOS>
good
thing
lose
amid
a
wilderness
of
weed
,
to
be
sure
,
whose
rankness
far
over
-
top
their
neglect
growth
;
yet
,
notwithstanding
,
evidence
of
a
wealthy
soil
,
that
may
yield
luxuriant
crop
under
other
and
favourable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
I
believe
,
have
not
treat
him
physically
ill
;
thank
to
his
fearless
nature
,
which
offer
no
temptation
to
that
course
of
oppression
:
he
have
none
of
the
timid
susceptibility
that
would
have
give
zest
to
ill
-
treatment
,
in
Heathcliff
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
have
bend
his
malevolence
on
make
him
a
brute
:
he
be
never
teach
to
read
or
write
;
never
rebuke
for
any
bad
habit
which
do
not
annoy
his
keeper
;
never
lead
a
single
step
towards
virtue
,
or
guard
by
a
single
precept
against
vice
.
<EOS>
and
from
what
I
hear
,
Joseph
contribute
much
to
his
deterioration
,
by
a
narrow
-
minded
partiality
which
prompt
him
to
flatter
and
pet
him
,
as
a
boy
,
because
he
be
the
head
of
the
old
family
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
accuse
Catherine
Earnshaw
and
Heathcliff
,
when
child
,
of
put
the
master
past
his
patience
,
and
compel
him
to
seek
solace
in
drink
by
what
he
term
their
"
offald
way
,
"
so
at
present
he
lay
the
whole
burden
of
Hareton
's
fault
on
the
shoulder
of
the
usurper
of
his
property
.
<EOS>
if
the
lad
swear
,
he
would
not
correct
him
:
nor
however
culpably
he
behave
.
<EOS>
It
give
Joseph
satisfaction
,
apparently
,
to
watch
him
go
the
bad
length
:
he
allow
that
the
lad
be
ruin
:
that
his
soul
be
abandon
to
perdition
;
but
then
he
reflect
that
Heathcliff
must
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hareton
's
blood
would
be
require
at
his
hand
;
and
there
lie
immense
consolation
in
that
thought
.
<EOS>
Joseph
have
instill
into
him
a
pride
of
name
,
and
of
his
lineage
;
he
would
,
have
he
dare
,
have
foster
hate
between
him
and
the
present
owner
of
the
Heights
:
but
his
dread
of
that
owner
amount
to
superstition
;
and
he
confine
his
feeling
regard
him
to
muttered
innuendo
and
private
commination
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
intimately
acquaint
with
the
mode
of
live
customary
in
those
day
at
Wuthering
Heights
:
I
only
speak
from
hearsay
;
for
I
see
little
.
<EOS>
the
villager
affirm
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
_
near
_
,
and
a
cruel
hard
landlord
to
his
tenant
;
but
the
house
,
inside
,
have
regain
its
ancient
aspect
of
comfort
under
female
management
,
and
the
scene
of
riot
common
in
Hindley
's
time
be
not
now
enact
within
its
wall
.
<EOS>
the
master
be
too
gloomy
to
seek
companionship
with
any
people
,
good
or
bad
;
and
he
be
yet
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
make
progress
with
my
story
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
reject
the
peace
-
offering
of
the
terrier
,
and
demand
her
own
dog
,
Charlie
and
Phoenix
.
<EOS>
They
come
limp
and
hang
their
head
;
and
we
set
out
for
home
,
sadly
out
of
sort
,
every
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
wring
from
my
little
lady
how
she
have
spend
the
day
;
except
that
,
as
I
suppose
,
the
goal
of
her
pilgrimage
be
Penistone
Crags
;
and
she
arrive
without
adventure
to
the
gate
of
the
farm
-
house
,
when
Hareton
happen
to
issue
forth
,
attend
by
some
canine
follower
,
who
attack
her
train
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
smart
battle
,
before
their
owner
could
separate
them
:
that
form
an
introduction
.
<EOS>
Catherine
tell
Hareton
who
she
be
,
and
where
she
be
go
;
and
ask
him
to
show
her
the
way
:
finally
,
beguile
him
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
He
open
the
mystery
of
the
Fairy
Cave
,
and
twenty
other
queer
place
.
<EOS>
but
,
be
in
disgrace
,
I
be
not
favour
with
a
description
of
the
interesting
object
she
see
.
<EOS>
I
could
gather
,
however
,
that
her
guide
have
be
a
favourite
till
she
hurt
his
feeling
by
address
him
as
a
servant
;
and
Heathcliff
's
housekeeper
hurt
her
by
call
him
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
then
the
language
he
have
hold
to
her
rankle
in
her
heart
;
<EOS>
she
who
be
always
"
love
,
"
and
"
darling
,
"
and
"
queen
,
"
and
"
angel
,
"
with
everybody
at
the
Grange
,
to
be
insult
so
shockingly
by
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
comprehend
it
;
and
hard
work
I
have
to
obtain
a
promise
that
she
would
not
lay
the
grievance
before
her
father
.
<EOS>
I
explain
how
he
object
to
the
whole
household
at
the
Heights
,
and
how
sorry
he
would
be
to
find
she
have
be
there
;
but
I
insist
most
on
the
fact
,
that
if
she
reveal
my
negligence
of
his
order
,
he
would
perhaps
be
so
angry
that
I
should
have
to
leave
;
and
Cathy
could
not
bear
that
prospect
:
she
pledge
her
word
,
and
keep
it
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
she
be
a
sweet
little
girl
.
    
<EOS>
a
letter
,
edge
with
black
,
announce
the
day
of
my
master
's
return
.
<EOS>
Isabella
be
dead
;
and
he
write
to
bid
me
get
mourn
for
his
daughter
,
and
arrange
a
room
,
and
other
accommodation
,
for
his
youthful
nephew
.
<EOS>
Catherine
run
wild
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
welcome
her
father
back
;
and
indulge
most
sanguine
anticipation
of
the
innumerable
excellency
of
her
"
real
"
cousin
.
<EOS>
the
evening
of
their
expect
arrival
come
.
<EOS>
since
early
morning
she
have
be
busy
order
her
own
small
affair
;
and
now
attire
in
her
new
black
frock
 
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
her
aunt
's
death
impress
her
with
no
definite
sorrow
 
<EOS>
she
oblige
me
,
by
constant
worrying
,
to
walk
with
her
down
through
the
ground
to
meet
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Linton
be
just
six
month
young
than
I
be
,
"
she
chatter
,
as
we
stroll
leisurely
over
the
swell
and
hollow
of
mossy
turf
,
under
shadow
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
"
how
delightful
it
will
be
to
have
him
for
a
playfellow
!
<EOS>
Aunt
Isabella
send
papa
a
beautiful
lock
of
his
hair
;
it
be
light
than
mine
 
more
flaxen
,
and
quite
as
fine
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
carefully
preserve
in
a
little
glass
box
;
and
I
have
often
think
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
see
its
owner
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
happy
 
and
papa
,
dear
,
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
come
,
Ellen
,
let
us
run
!
<EOS>
come
,
run
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
run
,
and
return
and
run
again
,
many
time
before
my
sober
footstep
reach
the
gate
,
and
then
she
seat
herself
on
the
grassy
bank
beside
the
path
,
and
try
to
wait
patiently
;
but
that
be
impossible
:
she
could
not
be
still
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
they
be
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
see
,
some
dust
on
the
road
 
they
be
come
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
when
will
they
be
here
?
<EOS>
May
we
not
go
a
little
way
 
<EOS>
half
a
mile
,
Ellen
,
only
just
half
a
mile
?
<EOS>
do
say
<EOS>
yes
:
to
that
clump
of
birch
at
the
turn
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
refuse
staunchly
.
<EOS>
at
length
her
suspense
be
end
:
the
travel
carriage
roll
in
sight
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
shriek
and
stretch
out
her
arm
as
soon
as
she
catch
her
father
's
face
look
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
descend
,
nearly
as
eager
as
herself
;
and
a
considerable
interval
elapse
<EOS>
ere
they
have
a
thought
to
spare
for
any
but
themselves
.
<EOS>
while
they
exchange
caress
I
take
a
peep
in
to
see
after
Linton
.
<EOS>
He
be
asleep
in
a
corner
,
wrap
in
a
warm
,
fur
-
line
cloak
,
as
if
it
have
be
winter
.
<EOS>
a
pale
,
delicate
,
effeminate
boy
,
who
may
have
be
take
for
my
master
's
young
brother
,
so
strong
be
the
resemblance
:
but
there
be
a
sickly
peevishness
in
his
aspect
that
Edgar
Linton
never
have
.
<EOS>
the
latter
see
me
look
;
and
have
shake
hand
,
advise
me
to
close
the
door
,
and
leave
him
undisturbed
;
for
the
journey
have
fatigue
him
.
<EOS>
Cathy
would
fain
have
take
one
glance
,
but
her
father
tell
her
to
come
,
and
they
walk
together
up
the
park
,
while
I
hasten
before
to
prepare
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
darling
,
"
say
Mr.
Linton
,
address
his
daughter
,
as
they
halt
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
step
:
"
your
cousin
be
not
so
strong
or
so
merry
as
you
be
,
and
he
have
lose
his
mother
,
remember
,
a
very
short
time
since
;
therefore
,
do
not
expect
him
to
play
and
run
about
with
you
directly
.
<EOS>
and
do
not
harass
him
much
by
talk
:
let
him
be
quiet
this
evening
,
at
least
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
papa
,
"
answer
Catherine
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
want
to
see
him
;
and
he
have
not
once
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
stop
;
and
the
sleeper
be
rouse
,
be
lift
to
the
ground
by
his
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
your
cousin
Cathy
,
Linton
,
"
he
say
,
put
their
little
hand
together
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
fond
of
you
already
;
and
mind
you
do
not
grieve
her
by
cry
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
try
to
be
cheerful
now
;
the
travelling
be
at
an
end
,
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
rest
and
amuse
yourself
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
to
bed
,
then
,
"
answer
the
boy
,
shrink
from
Catherine
's
salute
;
and
he
put
his
finger
to
remove
incipient
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
there
be
a
good
child
,
"
I
whisper
,
lead
him
in
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
her
weep
too
 
see
how
sorry
she
be
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
sorrow
for
him
,
but
his
cousin
put
on
as
sad
a
countenance
as
himself
,
and
return
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
all
three
enter
,
and
mount
to
the
library
,
where
tea
be
lay
ready
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
remove
Linton
's
cap
and
mantle
,
and
place
him
on
a
chair
by
the
table
;
but
he
be
no
sooner
seated
than
he
begin
to
cry
afresh
.
<EOS>
My
master
inquire
what
be
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sit
on
a
chair
,
"
sob
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
to
the
sofa
,
then
,
and
Ellen
shall
bring
you
some
tea
,
"
answer
his
uncle
patiently
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
greatly
try
,
during
the
journey
,
I
feel
convinced
,
by
his
fretful
ailing
charge
.
<EOS>
Linton
slowly
trail
himself
off
,
and
lie
down
.
<EOS>
Cathy
carry
a
footstool
and
her
cup
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
sit
silent
;
but
that
could
not
last
:
she
have
resolve
to
make
a
pet
of
her
little
cousin
,
as
she
would
have
him
to
be
;
and
she
commence
stroke
his
curl
,
and
kiss
his
cheek
,
and
offer
him
tea
in
her
saucer
,
like
a
baby
.
<EOS>
this
please
him
,
for
he
be
not
much
well
:
he
dry
his
eye
,
and
lighten
into
a
faint
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
will
do
very
well
,
"
say
the
master
to
me
,
after
watch
them
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
if
we
can
keep
him
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
the
company
of
a
child
of
his
own
age
will
instil
new
spirit
into
him
soon
,
and
by
wish
for
strength
he
will
gain
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
if
we
can
keep
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
muse
to
myself
;
and
sore
misgiving
come
over
me
that
there
be
slight
hope
of
that
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
think
,
how
ever
will
that
weakle
live
at
Wuthering
Heights
?
<EOS>
between
his
father
and
Hareton
,
what
playmate
and
instructor
they
will
be
.
<EOS>
Our
doubt
be
presently
decide
 
even
earlier
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
take
the
child
up
-
stair
,
after
tea
be
finish
,
and
see
Linton
asleep
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
leave
him
till
<EOS>
that
be
the
case
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
down
,
and
be
stand
by
the
table
in
the
hall
,
light
a
bedroom
candle
for
Mr.
Edgar
,
when
a
maid
step
out
of
the
kitchen
and
inform
me
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
servant
Joseph
be
at
the
door
,
and
wish
to
speak
with
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ask
him
what
he
want
first
,
"
I
say
,
in
considerable
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"
a
very
unlikely
hour
to
be
troubling
people
,
and
the
instant
they
have
return
from
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
the
master
can
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
have
advance
through
the
kitchen
as
I
utter
these
word
,
and
now
present
himself
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
be
don
in
his
Sunday
garment
,
with
his
most
sanctimonious
and
sourest
face
,
and
,
hold
his
hat
in
one
hand
,
and
his
stick
in
the
other
,
he
proceed
to
clean
his
shoe
on
the
mat
.
  
<EOS>
"

I

,
coldly

<EOS>
"
It

he
answer
,
wave
me
disdainfully
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Linton
be
go
to

;
unless
you
have
something
particular
to

I
be
sure
he

not
hear
it

I
continue
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
sit
down
in
there
,
and
entrust
your
message
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
which
be
his
rahm
?
<EOS>
"
pursue
the
fellow
,
survey
the
range
of
closed
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
perceive
he
be
bent
on
refuse
my
mediation
,
so
very
reluctantly
I
go
up
to
the
library
,
and
announce
the
unseasonable
visitor
,
advise
that
he
should
be
dismiss
till
next
day

<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
have
no
time
to
empower
me
to
do
so

for
Joseph
mount
close
at
my
heel
,
and
,
push
into
the
apartment
,
plant
himself
at
the
far
side
of
the
table
,
with
his
two
fist
clap
on
the
head
of
his
stick
,
and
begin
in
an
elevated
tone

"
  
<EOS>
Edgar
Linton
be
silent
a
minute
;
an
expression
of
exceed
sorrow
overcast
his
feature
:
he
would
have
pity
the
child
on
his
own
account
;
but
,
recall
Isabella
's
hope
and
fear
,
and
anxious
wish
for
her
son
,
and
her
commendation
of
him
to
his
care
,
he
grieve
bitterly
at
the
prospect
of
yield
him
up
,
and
search
in
his
heart
how
it
may
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
no
plan
offer
itself
:
the
very
exhibition
of
any
desire
to
keep
him
would
have
render
the
claimant
more
peremptory
:
there
be
nothing
leave
but
to
resign
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
not
go
to
rouse
him
from
his
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
Mr.

he

calmly

that

Wuthering
Heights
to

morrow

<EOS>
He
be
in
bed
,
and
too
tired
to
go
the
distance
now
.
<EOS>
You
may
also
tell
him
that
the
mother
of
Linton

him
to
remain
under
my
guardianship
;
and
,
at

,
his
health

<EOS>
"
Noa

say
Joseph
,
give
a
thud
with
his
prop
on
the
floor
,
and
assume
an
authoritative

Mr.

commission
me
to

home
early

on

he

she

it
be
well
for

lest

restless

<EOS>
Linton
be
very
reluctant
to
be
rouse
from
his
bed
at
five
o'clock
,
and
astonish
to
be
inform
that
he
must
prepare
for
further
travel
;
but
I
soften
off
the
matter
by
state
that
he
be
go
to
spend
some
time
with
his
father
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
wish
to
see
him
so
much
,
he
do
not
like
to
defer
the
pleasure

he
should
recover
from
his
late
journey

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
"
He
live
a
little
distance
from

I
reply
;

just
beyond

hill

not
so
far

you
may
walk
over

you
do
your

will
love
you
.

<EOS>
"
but
why
have
I
not
hear
of
him
before
?
"
ask
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
mamma
and
he
live
together
,
as
other
people
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
business
to
keep
him
in
the
north
,
"
I
answer
,
"
and
your
mother
's
health
require
her
to
reside
in
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
do
not
mamma
speak
to
me
about
him
?
"
persevere
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
She
often
talk
of
uncle
,
and
I
learn
to
love
him
long
ago
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
love
papa
?
<EOS>
I
do
not

him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
all

love

parent

"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
,
perhaps
,
think
you
would
want
to
be
with
him
if
she
mention
him
often
to
you
.
<EOS>
let
us
make
haste
.
<EOS>
an
early
ride
on
such
a
beautiful
morning
be
much
preferable
to
an
hour

more
sleep

to

with

continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
shall
be
your

there
,
"
I

.
  
<EOS>
Linton
sink
back
on
his
pillow
and
fall
into
a
brown
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
without
uncle
,
"
he
cry
at
length
:
"
I
can
not
tell
where
you
mean
to
take
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
persuade
him
of
the
naughtiness
of
show
reluctance
to
meet
his
father
;
still
he
obstinately
resist
any
progress
towards
dress
,
and
I
have
to
call
for
my
master
's
assistance
in
coax
him
out
of
bed
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
be
finally
get
off
,
with
several
delusive
assurance
that
his
absence
should
be
short
:
that
Mr.
Edgar
and
Cathy
would
visit
him
,
and
other
promise
,
equally
ill
-
found
,
which
I
invent
and
reiterate
at
interval
throughout
the
way
.
<EOS>
the
pure
heather
-
scent
air
,
the
bright
sunshine
,
and
the
gentle
canter
of
Minny
,
relieve
his
despondency
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
put
question
concern
his
new
home
,
and
its
inhabitant
,
with
great
interest
and
liveliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Wuthering
Heights
as
pleasant
a
place
as
Thrushcross
Grange
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
,
turn
to
take
a
last
glance
into
the
valley
,
whence
a
light
mist
mount
and
form
a
fleecy
cloud
on
the
skirt
of
the
blue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
bury
in
tree
,
"
I
reply
,
"
and
it
be
not
quite
so
large
,
but
you
can
see
the
country
beautifully
all
round
;
and
the
air
be
healthy
for
you
 
fresher
and
drier
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
perhaps
,
think
the
building
old

dark
at
first
;
though
it
be
a
respectable
house
:
the
next
best
in
the
neighbourhood

you
will
have
such
nice
ramble
on
the
moor

Hareton
Earnshaw

Miss

so
yours
in

manner
 
will
show
you
all
the
sweetest
spot
;

you
can
bring
a
book
in
fine
weather
,
and
make
a
green
hollow
your
study
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
your
uncle
may
join
you
in
a
walk
:
he
do
,
frequently
,
walk
out
on
the
hill

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
be
my
father
like
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
as
young
and
handsome
as
uncle

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
as
young

"
say
I
;

he
have
black
hair

look
sterner
;

he
be
tall

big

<EOS>
He
will
not
seem
to
you
so
gentle

kind
at
first
,
perhaps
,
because
it
be
not
his
way
:
<EOS>
still
,
mind
you
,
be
frank

cordial
with
him

naturally
he

I
answer
:
not

with
regret
the
white
complexion

slim
frame
of
my

languid
eye

It

Mr.

summer

never

now
it

the

fully
occupy
with
his

cogitation
for
the

of

ride
,
till
we
halt
before
the
farmhouse
garden

gate
.
<EOS>
I
watch
to
catch
his
impression
in
his
countenance

He
survey
the
carved
front
and
low
-
browe
lattice
,
the
straggle
gooseberry
-
bush
and
crooked
fir
,
with
solemn
intentness
,
and
then
shake
his
head
:
his
private
feeling
entirely
disapprove
of
the
exterior
of
his

he
have
sense
to
postpone
complaining

there
may
be
compensation
within
.
<EOS>
before

dismount

I
go
and
open
the
door

<EOS>
It
be
half
-
past
six

just
finish
breakfast

wipe
down

say
Mr.

,
when

up

tremble

down

He
do
not

whether
it

indeed

he

certain
that

stranger

he
cling
to

trepidation

on

out

<EOS>
He
take
off
the
boy
's
cap
and
push
back
his
thick
flaxen
curl
,
feel
his
slend
arm
and
his
small
finger
;
during
which
examination
Linton
cease
crying
,
and
lift
his
great
blue
eye
to
inspect
the
inspector
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know

"
ask
Heathcliff

have
satisfy
himself
that
the

equally
frail

feeble

"
no

Linton

no

never

<EOS>
You
be
my
son

then
,
I
will
tell
you

your

you

<EOS>
now
,
do
not

sit
down

I
guess
you
will
report
what
you
hear

laugh

<EOS>
"
only
nobody
else
must
be
kind

Joseph

when

<EOS>
that
be
the
sole
consideration
which
can
make
me
endure
the
whelp
:
I
despise
him
for
himself

hate
him
for
the
memory
he
revive

that
consideration
be
sufficient

preserve

above

I
do
regret

that

if
I

it
be

though
he
be
compel
to
retain
the
sentiment
in

while
Linton
be
engage
in
timidly
rebuff
the
advance
of
a
friendly
sheep
-
dog
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
much
on
the
alert
to
be
cheat
:
as
I
close
the
door
,
I
hear
a
cry
,
and
a
frantic
repetition
of
the
word
    
"
do
not
leave
me
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
stay
here
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
stay
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
the
latch
be
raise
and
fall
:
<EOS>
they
do
not
suffer
him
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
I
mount
Minny
,
and
urge
her
to
a
trot
;
and
so
my
brief
guardianship
end
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
sad
work
with
little
Cathy
that
day
:
she
rise
in
high
glee
,
eager
to
join
her
cousin
,
and
such
passionate
tear
and
lamentation
follow
the
news
of
his
departure
that
Edgar
himself
be
oblige
to
soothe
her
,
by
affirm
he
should
come
back
soon
<EOS>
:
he
add
,
however
,
"
if
I
can
get
him
"
;
and
there
be
no
hope
of
that
.
<EOS>
this
promise
poorly
pacify
her
;
but
time
be
more
potent
;
and
though
still
at
interval
she
inquire
of
her
father
when
Linton
would
return
,
before
she
do
see
him
again
his
feature
have
wax
so
dim
in
her
memory
that
she
do
not
recognise
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
chance
to
encounter
the
housekeeper
of
Wuthering
Heights
,
in
pay
business
visit
to
Gimmerton
,
I
use
to
ask
how
the
young
master
get
on
;
for
he
live
almost
as
secluded
as
Catherine
herself
,
and
be
never
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
I
could
gather
from
her
that
he
continue
in
weak
health
,
and
be
a
tiresome
inmate
.
<EOS>
She
say
Mr.
Heathcliff
seem
to
dislike
him
ever
longer
and
bad
,
though
he
take
some
trouble
to
conceal
it
:
he
have
an
antipathy
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
could
not
do
at
all
with
his
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
him
<EOS>
many
minute
together
.
<EOS>
there
seldom
pass
much
talk
between
them
:
Linton
learn
his
lesson
and
spend
his
evening
in
a
small
apartment
they
call
the
parlour
:
or
else
lie
in
bed
all
day
:
for
he
be
constantly
get
cough
,
and
cold
,
and
ache
,
and
pain
of
some
sort
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
never
know
such
a
fainthearte
creature
,
"
add
the
woman
;
"
nor
one
so
careful
of
hisseln
.
<EOS>
He
_
will
_
go
on
,
if
I
leave
the
window
open
a
bit
late
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
kill
,
a
breath
of
night
air
!
<EOS>
and
he
must
have
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
summer
;
and
Joseph
's
bacca
-
pipe
be
poison
;
and
he
must
always
have
sweet
and
dainty
,
and
always
milk
,
milk
for
ever
 
heeding
naught
how
the
rest
of
us
be
pinch
in
winter
;
and
there
he
will
sit
,
wrap
in
his
furred
cloak
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
,
with
some
toast
and
water
or
other
slop
on
the
hob
to
sip
at
;
and
if
Hareton
,
for
pity
,
come
to
amuse
him
 
<EOS>
Hareton
be
not
bad
-
natured
,
though
he
be
rough
 
<EOS>
they
be
sure
to
part
,
one
swearing
and
the
other
crying
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
master
would
relish
Earnshaw
's
thrash
him
to
a
mummy
,
if
he
be
not
his
son
;
and
I
be
certain
he
would
be
fit
to
turn
him
out
of
door
,
if
he
know
half
the
nursing
he
give
hisseln
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
will
not
go
into
danger
of
temptation
:
he
never
enter
the
parlour
,
and
should
Linton
show
those
way
in
the
house
where
he
be
,
he
send
him
up
-
stair
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
divine
,
from
this
account
,
that
utter
lack
of
sympathy
have
render
young
Heathcliff
selfish
and
disagreeable
,
if
he
be
not
so
originally
;
and
my
interest
in
him
,
consequently
,
decay
:
though
still
I
be
move
with
a
sense
of
grief
at
his
lot
,
and
a
wish
that
he
have
be
leave
with
us
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Edgar
encourage
me
to
gain
information
:
he
think
a
great
deal
about
him
,
I
fancy
,
and
would
have
run
some
risk
to
see
him
;
and
he
tell
me
once
to
ask
the
housekeeper
whether
he
ever
come
into
the
village
?
<EOS>
She
say
he
have
only
be
twice
,
on
horseback
,
accompany
his
father
;
and
both
time
he
pretend
to
be
quite
knock
up
for
three
or
four
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
that
housekeeper
leave
,
if
I
recollect
rightly
,
two
year
after
he
come
;
and
another
,
whom
I
do
not
know
,
be
her
successor
;
she
live
there
still
.
  
<EOS>
time
wear
on
at
the
grange
in
its
former
pleasant
way
till
Miss
Cathy
reach
sixteen
.
<EOS>
on
the
anniversary
of
her
birth
we
never
manifest
any
sign
of
rejoice
,
because
it
be
also
the
anniversary
of
my
late
mistress
's
death
.
<EOS>
Her
father
invariably
spend
that
day
alone
in
the
library
;
and
walk
,
at
dusk
,
as
far
as
Gimmerton
kirkyard
,
where
he
would
frequently
prolong
his
stay
beyond
midnight
.
<EOS>
therefore
Catherine
be
throw
on
her
own
resource
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
this
twentieth
of
March
be
a
beautiful
spring
day
,
and
when
her
father
have
retire
,
my
young
lady
come
down
dressed
for
go
out
,
and
say
she
ask
to
have
a
ramble
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
with
me
<EOS>
:
Mr.
Linton
have
give
her
leave
,
if
we
go
only
a
short
distance
and
be
back
within
the
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
make
haste
,
Ellen
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
I
wish
to
go
;
where
a
colony
of
moor
-
game
be
settle
:
I
want
to
see
whether
they
have
make
their
nest
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
must
be
a
good
distance
up
,
"
I
answer
;
"
they
do
not
breed
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
go
very
near
with
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
sally
out
,
think
nothing
more
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
bound
before
me
,
and
return
to
my
side
,
and
be
off
again
like
a
young
greyhound
;
and
,
at
first
,
I
find
plenty
of
entertainment
in
listen
to
the
lark
singe
far
and
near
,
and
enjoy
the
sweet
,
warm
sunshine
;
and
watch
her
,
my
pet
and
my
delight
,
with
her
golden
ringlet
fly
loose
behind
,
and
her
bright
cheek
,
as
soft
and
pure
in
its
bloom
as
a
wild
rise
,
and
her
eye
radiant
with
cloudless
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
happy
creature
,
and
an
angel
,
in
those
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
she
could
not
be
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
your
moor
-
game
,
Miss
Cathy
?
<EOS>
We
should
be
at
them
:
<EOS>
the
Grange
park
-
fence
be
a
great
way
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
a
little
further
 
only
a
little
further
,
Ellen
,
"
be
her
answer
,
continually
.
<EOS>
"
climb
to
that
hillock
,
pass
that
bank
,
and
by
the
time
you
reach
the
other
side
I
shall
have
raise
the
bird
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
so
many
hillock
and
bank
to
climb
and
pass
,
that
,
at
length
,
I
begin
to
be
weary
,
and
tell
her
we
must
halt
,
and
retrace
our
step
.
<EOS>
I
shout
to
her
,
as
she
have
outstrip
me
a
long
way
;
she
either
do
not
hear
or
do
not
regard
,
for
she
still
spring
on
,
and
I
be
compel
to
follow
.
<EOS>
finally
,
she
dive
into
a
hollow
;
and
before
I
come
in
sight
of
her
again
,
she
be
two
mile
near
Wuthering
Heights
than
her
own
home
;
and
I
beheld
a
couple
of
person
arrest
her
,
one
of
whom
I
feel
convinced
be
Mr.
Heathcliff
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Cathy
have
be
catch
in
the
fact
of
plundering
,
or
,
at
least
,
hunt
out
the
nest
of
the
grouse
.
<EOS>
the
Heights
be
Heathcliff
's
land
,
and
he
be
reprove
the
poacher
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
neither
take
any
nor
find
any
,
"
she
say
,
as
I
toil
to
them
,
expand
her
hand
in
corroboration
of
the
statement
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
take
them
;
but
papa
tell
me
there
be
quantity
up
here
,
and
I
wish
to
see
the
egg
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
glance
at
me
with
an
ill
-
mean
smile
,
express
his
acquaintance
with
the
party
,
and
,
consequently
,
his
malevolence
towards
it
,
and
demand
who
"
papa
"
be
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Linton
of
Thrushcross
Grange
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
do
not
know
me
,
or
you
would
not
have
speak
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
papa
be
highly
esteemed
and
respect
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
sarcastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Catherine
,
gaze
curiously
on
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
that
man
I
have
see
before
.
<EOS>
be
he
your
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
point
to
Hareton
,
the
other
individual
,
who
have
gain
nothing
but
increase
bulk
and
strength
by
the
addition
of
two
year
to
his
age
:
he
seem
as
awkward
and
rough
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Cathy
,
"
I
interrupt
,
"
it
will
be
three
hour
instead
of
one
that
we
be
out
,
presently
.
<EOS>
We
really
must
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
man
be
not
my
son
,
"
answer
Heathcliff
,
push
me
aside
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
one
,
and
you
have
see
him
before
too
;
and
,
though
your
nurse
be
in
a
hurry
,
I
think
both
you
and
she
would
be
the
well
for
a
little
rest
.
<EOS>
Will
you
just
turn
this
nab
of
heath
,
and
walk
into
my
house
?
<EOS>
You
will
get
home
earlier
for
the
ease
;
and
you
shall
receive
a
kind
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
whisper
Catherine
<EOS>
that
she
must
not
,
on
any
account
,
accede
to
the
proposal
:
it
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tired
of
run
,
and
the
ground
be
dewy
:
I
can
not
sit
here
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
say
I
have
see
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
be
mistaken
,
I
think
;
but
I
guess
where
he
live
:
at
the
farmhouse
I
visit
in
come
from
Penistone
Crags
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
come
,
nelly
,
hold
your
tongue
 
it
will
be
a
treat
for
her
to
look
in
on
us
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
get
forwards
with
the
lass
.
<EOS>
You
shall
walk
with
me
,
nelly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
she
be
not
go
to
any
such
place
,
"
I
cry
,
struggle
to
release
my
arm
,
which
he
have
seize
:
but
she
be
almost
at
the
door
-
stone
already
,
scamper
round
the
brow
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
Her
appoint
companion
do
not
pretend
to
escort
her
:
he
shy
off
by
the
road
-
side
,
and
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
it
be
very
wrong
,
"
I
continue
:
"
<EOS>
you
know
you
mean
no
good
.
<EOS>
and
there
she
will
see
Linton
,
and
all
will
be
tell
as
soon
as
ever
we
return
;
and
I
shall
have
the
blame
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
her
to
see
Linton
,
"
he
answer
;
"
he
be
look
better
these
few
day
;
it
be
not
often
he
be
fit
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
and
we
will
soon
persuade
her
to
keep
the
visit
secret
:
<EOS>
where
be
the
harm
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
harm
of
it
be
,
that
her
father
would
hate
me
if
he
find
I
suffer
her
to
enter
your
house
;
and
I
be
convince
you
have
a
bad
design
in
encourage
her
to
do
so
,
"
I
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
design
be
as
honest
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
will
inform
you
of
its
whole
scope
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
that
the
two
cousin
may
fall
in
love
,
and
get
married
.
<EOS>
I
be
act
generously
to
your
master
:
<EOS>
his
young
chit
have
no
expectation
,
and
should
she
second
my
wish
<EOS>
she
will
be
provide
for
at
once
as
joint
successor
with
Linton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
Linton
die
,
"
I
answer
,
"
and
his
life
be
quite
uncertain
,
Catherine
would
be
the
heir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
she
would
not
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
clause
in
the
will
to
secure
it
so
:
his
property
would
go
to
me
;
but
,
to
prevent
dispute
,
I
desire
their
union
,
and
be
resolve
to
bring
it
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
resolve
she
shall
never
approach
your
house
with
me
again
,
"
I
return
,
as
we
reach
the
gate
,
where
Miss
Cathy
wait
our
come
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
bade
<EOS>
me
be
quiet
;
and
,
precede
us
up
the
path
,
<EOS>
hasten
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
My
young
lady
give
him
several
look
,
as
if
she
could
not
exactly
make
up
her
mind
what
to
think
of
him
;
but
now
he
smile
when
he
meet
her
eye
,
and
soften
his
voice
in
address
her
;
and
I
be
foolish
enough
to
imagine
the
memory
of
her
mother
may
disarm
him
from
desire
her
injury
.
<EOS>
Linton
stand
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
out
walk
in
the
field
,
for
his
cap
be
on
,
and
he
be
call
to
Joseph
to
bring
him
dry
shoe
.
<EOS>
He
have
grow
tall
of
his
age
,
still
want
some
month
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
pretty
yet
,
and
his
eye
and
complexion
brighter
than
I
remember
them
,
though
with
merely
temporary
lustre
borrow
from
the
salubrious
air
and
genial

<EOS>
the
youth
step
forward

acknowledge
himself

kiss
him
fervently

they
gaze
with
wonder
at
the
change

have
work
in
the
appearance

Catherine
have
reach
her
full
height

her
figure

both
plump

slender
,
elastic
as
steel

her
whole
aspect
sparkle
with
health
and
spirit

<EOS>
Linton
's
look
and
movement
be
very
languid
,
and
his
form
extremely
slight
;

there
be
a
grace
in
his
manner
that
mitigate
these
defect
,
and
render
him
not
unplease

<EOS>
after
exchange
numerous
mark
of
fondness
with
him

his
cousin
go
to
Mr.
Heathcliff

who
linger
by
the
door
,
divide
his
attention
between
the
object
inside

those
that
lie
without

pretend

that
is

to
observe
the

all

the

with
a
hardly

result
from

"
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
it

I
would
better
tell
you

<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
have
a
prejudice
against
me
:
we
quarrel
at
one
time
of
our
life
,
with
unchristian
ferocity
;
and
,
if
you
mention
come
here
to
him
,
he
will
put
a
veto
on
your
visit
altogether
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
you
must
not
mention
it
,
unless
you
be
careless
of
see
your
cousin
hereafter

:
you
may
come
,
if
you
will
,
but
you
must
not
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
quarrel
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Catherine
,
considerably
crestfallen

<EOS>
"
He
think
me
too
poor
to

would
his
sister

answer
Heathcliff

"
and
be
grieve
that
I
get
her

his
pride

hurt

he
will
never
forgive
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
wrong

say
the
young
lady
:
"
some
time
I
will
tell
him
so

Linton

I
have
no

I

he
shall
come
to
the
Grange

<EOS>
"
It
will
be

far

her

to

four
mile
would
kill
me

<EOS>
no

come
here

Miss

launch
towards

<EOS>
Miss
Catherine

as
the
ninny
call
her

will
discover
his
value

send
him
to
the
devil

<EOS>
now
,
if
it
have
be
Hareton

<EOS>
do
you
know
that
,
twenty
time
a

I
covet
Hareton

his

I
would
have
love

some
one
else

I

be
safe

<EOS>
I
will
pit
him
against

paltry
creature

bestir
itself
briskly

We
calculate
it
will
scarcely
last
till
it
be
eighteen

oh

confound
the
vapid
thing

He

absorb
in

have
you
nothing

take
her
into
the
garden

before
you
change
your

into

stable

see
your
horse

"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
not
you
rather
sit
here

ask
Linton

address
Cathy
in
a
tone
which
express
reluctance

move
again

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

she
reply
,
cast
a
longing
look
to
the
door
,
and
evidently
eager
to
be
active
.
  
<EOS>
He
keep
his
seat
,
and
shrink
closer
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
rise
,
and
go
into
the
kitchen
,

from
thence
to
the
yard
,
call
out
for
Hareton

<EOS>
Hareton
respond
,
and
presently
the
two
re
-
enter
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
have
be
wash
himself
,
as
be
visible
by
the
glow
on
his
cheek

his
wetted
hair

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
ask
_
you

cry
Miss
Cathy

recollect
the
housekeeper

assertion

"
yes

Catherine
look
queer

<EOS>
"
be
he
not

lad

<EOS>
he
continue
.
  
<EOS>
the
uncivil
little
thing
stand
on
tiptoe
,
and
whisper
a
sentence
in
Heathcliff
's
ear
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
;
Hareton
darken
:
<EOS>
I
perceive
he
be
very
sensitive
to
suspect
slight
,
and
have
obviously
a
dim
notion
of
his
inferiority
.
<EOS>
but
his
master
or
guardian
chase
the
frown
by
exclaim
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
the
favourite
among
us
,
Hareton

<EOS>
She
say
you
be
a
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
well
,
something
very
flattering
.
<EOS>
here
!
<EOS>
you
go
with
her
round
the
farm
.
<EOS>
and
behave
like
a
gentleman

mind
!
<EOS>
do
not
use
any
bad
word
;
and
do
not
stare
when
the
young
lady
be
not
look
at
you
,
and
be
ready
to
hide
your
face
when
she
be
;
and
,
when
you
speak
,
say
your
word
slowly
,
and
keep
your
hand
out
of
your
pocket

<EOS>
be
off
,
and
entertain
her
as
nicely
as
you
can

"
  
<EOS>
He
watch
the
couple
walk
past
the
window
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
have
his
countenance
completely
avert
from
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
seem
study
the
familiar
landscape
with
a
stranger
's
and
an
artist
's
interest
.
<EOS>
Catherine
take
a
sly
look
at
him
,
express
small
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
then
turn
her
attention
to
seek
out
object
of
amusement
for
herself
,
and
trip
merrily
on
,
lilt
a
tune
to
supply
the
lack
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tie
his
tongue
,
"
observe
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
venture
a
single
syllable
all
the
time
!
<EOS>
nelly
,
you
recollect
me
at
his
age
 
<EOS>
nay
,
some
year
young
.
<EOS>
do
I
ever
look
so
stupid
:
so
"
gaumless
,
"
as
Joseph
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bad
,
"
I
reply
,
"
because
more
sullen
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
pleasure
in
him
,
"
he
continue
,
reflect
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
satisfy
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
a
bear
fool
I
should
not
enjoy
it
half
so
much
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
no
fool
;
and
I
can
sympathise
with
all
his
feeling
,
have
feel
them
myself
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
he
suffer
now
,
for
instance
,
exactly
:
it
be
merely
a
beginning
of
what
he
shall
suffer
,
though
.
<EOS>
and
he
will
never
be
able
to
emerge
from
his
bathos
of
coarseness
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
him
faster
than
his
scoundrel
of
a
father
secure
me
,
and
lower
;
for
he
take
a
pride
in
his
brutishness
.
<EOS>
I
have
teach
him
to
scorn
everything
extra
-
animal
as
silly
and
weak
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
Hindley
would
be
proud
of
his
son
,
if
he
could
see
him
?
<EOS>
almost
as
proud
as
I
be
of
mine
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
this
difference
;
one
be
gold
put
to
the
use
of
paving
-
stone
,
and
the
other
be
tin
polish
to
ape
a
service
of
silver
.
<EOS>
_
Mine
_
have
nothing
valuable
about
it
;
yet
I
shall
have
the
merit
of
make
it
go
as
far
as
such
poor
stuff
can
go
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
have
first
-
rate
quality
,
and
they
be
lose
:
render
worse
than
unavaile
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
regret
;
he
would
have
more
than
any
<EOS>
but
I
be
aware
of
.
<EOS>
and
the
good
of
it
be
,
Hareton
be
damnably
fond
of
me
!
<EOS>
You
will
own
that
I
have
outmatch
Hindley
there
.
<EOS>
if
the
dead
villain
could
rise
from
his
grave
to
abuse
me
for
his
offspring
's
wrong
,
I
should
have
the
fun
of
see
the
say
offspring
fight
him
back
again
,
indignant
that
he
should
dare
to
rail
at
the
one
friend
he
have
in
the
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
chuckle
a
fiendish
laugh
at
the
idea
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
reply
,
because
I
see
that
he
expect
none
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
our
young
companion
,
who
sit
too
remove
from
us
to
hear
what
be
say
,
begin
to
evince
symptom
of
uneasiness
,
probably
repent
that
he
have
deny
himself
the
treat
of
Catherine
's
society
for
fear
of
a
little
fatigue
.
<EOS>
His
father
remark
the
restless
glance
wander
to
the
window
,
and
the
hand
irresolutely
extend
towards
his
cap
.
  
<EOS>
"
get
up
,
you
idle
boy
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
with
assumed
heartiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
away
after
them
!
<EOS>
they
be
just
at
the
corner
,
by
the
stand
of

<EOS>
Linton
gather
his
energy
,
and
leave
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
the
lattice
be
open
,
and
,
as
he
step
out
,
I
hear
Cathy
inquire
of
her
unsociable
attendant
<EOS>
what
be
that
inscription
over
the
door
?

Hareton
stare
up
,
and
scratch
his
head
like
a
true
clown
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
some
damnable
writing

he
answer

<EOS>

cry
Catherine
<EOS>
;
"
I
can
read
it
:
it

English

I
want
to
know
why
it

there

<EOS>
Linton
giggle
:
the
first
appearance
of
mirth
he
have
exhibit
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not

Could
you

existence

colossal
dunce

<EOS>

be
he
all
as
he
should

ask
Miss
Cathy
,
seriously
;

be
he
simple
:
not
right

<EOS>
I
have
question
him
twice
now

and
each
time
he
look
so
stupid
<EOS>
I
think
he
do
not

me

<EOS>
I
can
hardly
understand
him

I
be
sure
!

<EOS>
Linton
repeat
his
laugh
,
and
glance
at
Hareton
tauntingly
;
who
certainly
do
not
seem
quite
clear
of

at

Hareton

He
be
about
to
enlarge
further
,
but
the
two
youngster
break
into
a
noisy
fit
of
merriment
:

my
giddy

delighted
to
discover
that

turn
his
strange
talk

of
amusement

<EOS>
retort
the
angry
boor
,
retreating
,
while
his

burn
with
mingled
rage

mortification

Mr.

but
immediately
afterwards
cast
a
look
of
singular
aversion
on
the
flippant
pair
,
who
remain
chatter
in
the
door
-
way
:
the
boy
find
animation
enough
while
discuss
Hareton
's
fault
and
deficiency
,
and
relate
anecdote
of
his
going
on
;
and
the
girl
relish
his
pert
and
spiteful
saying
,
without
consider
the
ill
-
nature
they
evince
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
dislike
,
more
than
to
compassionate
Linton
,
and
to
excuse
his
father
in
some
measure
for
hold
him
cheap
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay
till
afternoon
:
I
could
not
tear
Miss
Cathy
away
sooner
;
but
happily
my
master
have
not
quit
his
apartment
,
and
remain
ignorant
of
our
prolong
absence
.
<EOS>
as
we
walk
home
,
I
would
fain
have
enlighten
my
charge
on
the
character
of
the
people
we
have
quit
:
but
she
get
it
into
her
head
that
I
be
prejudice
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
aha
!
"
she
cry
,
"
you
take
papa
's
side
,
Ellen
:
<EOS>
you
be
partial
I
know
;
or
else
you
would
not
have
cheat
me
so
many
year
into
the
notion
that
Linton
live
a
long
way
from
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
really
extremely
angry
;
only
I
be
so
pleased
I
can
not
show
it
!
<EOS>
but
you
must
hold
your
tongue
about
_
my
_
uncle
;
he
be
my
uncle
,
remember
;
and
I
will
scold
papa
for
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
she
run
on
,
till
I
relinquish
the
endeavour
to
convince
her
of
her
mistake
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
mention
the
visit
that
night
,
because
she
do
not
see
Mr.
Linton
.
<EOS>
next
day
it
all
come
out
,
sadly
to
my
chagrin
;
and
still
I
be
not
altogether
sorry
<EOS>
:
I
think
the
burden
of
direct
and
warning
would
be
more
efficiently
bear
by
him
than
me
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
timid
in
give
satisfactory
reason
for
his
wish
that
she
should
shun
connection
with
the
household
of
the
Heights
,
and
Catherine
like
good
reason
for
every
restraint
that
harass
her
pet
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
after
the
morning
's
salutation
,
"
guess
whom
I
see
yesterday
,
in
my
walk
on
the
moor
.
<EOS>
ah
,
papa
,
you
start
!
<EOS>
you
have
not
do
right
,
have
you
,
now
?
<EOS>
I
see
 
but
listen
,
and
you
shall
hear
how
I
find
you
out
;
and
Ellen
,
who
be
in
league
with
you
,
and
yet
pretend
to
pity
me
<EOS>
so
,
when
I
keep
hope
,
and
be
always
disappointed
about
Linton
's
come
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
give
a
faithful
account
of
her
excursion
and
its
consequence
;
and
my
master
,
though
he
cast
more
than
one
reproachful
look
at
me
,
say
nothing
till
she
have
conclude
.
<EOS>
then
he
draw
her
to
him
,
and
ask
if
she
know
why
he
have
conceal
Linton
's
near
neighbourhood
from
her
?
<EOS>
Could
she
think
it
be
to
deny
her
a
pleasure
that
she
may
harmlessly
enjoy
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
because
you
dislike
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
believe
I
care
more
for
my
own
feeling
than
yours
,
Cathy
?
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not
because
I
dislike
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
but
because
Mr.
Heathcliff
dislike
me
;
and
be
a
most
diabolical
man
,
delight
to
wrong
and
ruin
those
he
hate
,
if
they
give
him
the
slight
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
could
not
keep
up
an
acquaintance
with
your
cousin
without
be
bring
into
contact
with
him
;
and
I
know
he
would
detest
you
on
my
account
;
so
for
your
own
good
,
and
nothing
else
,
I
take
precaution
that
you
should
not
see
Linton
again
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
explain
this
some
time
as
you
grow
old
,
and
I
be
sorry
I
delay
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
quite
cordial
,
papa
,
"
observe
Catherine
,
not
at
all
convinced
;
"
and
he
do
not
object
to
our
see
each
other
:
he
say
I
may
come
to
his
house
when
I
please
;
only
I
must
not
tell
you
,
because
you
have
quarrel
with
him
,
and
would
not
forgive
him
for
marry
aunt
Isabella
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
be
the
one
to
be
blame
:
he
be
willing
to
let
us
be
friend
,
at
least
;
Linton
and
I
;
and
you
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
perceive
that
she
would
not
take
his
word
for
her
uncle
-
in
-
law
's
evil
disposition
,
give
a
hasty
sketch
of
his
conduct
to
Isabella
,
and
the
manner
in
which
Wuthering
Heights
become
his
property
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
discourse
long
upon
the
topic
;
for
though
he
speak
little
of
it
,
he
still
feel
the
same
horror
and
detestation
of
his
ancient
enemy
that
have
occupy
his
heart
ever
since
Mrs.
Linton
's
death
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
be
live
yet
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
him
!
"
be
his
constant
bitter
reflection
;
and
,
in
his
eye
,
Heathcliff
seem
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
Miss
Cathy
 
<EOS>
conversant
with
no
bad
deed
except
her
own
slight
act
of
disobedience
,
injustice
,
and
passion
,
arise
from
hot
temper
and
thoughtlessness
,
and
repent
of
on
the
day
they
be
commit
 
be
amazed
at
the
blackness
of
spirit
that
could
brood
on
and
cover
revenge
for
year
,
and
deliberately
prosecute
its
plan
without
a
visitation
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
She
appear
so
deeply
impressed
and
shock
at
this
new
view
of
human
nature
 
exclude
from
all
her
study
and
all
her
idea
till
now
 
that
Mr.
Edgar
deem
it
unnecessary
to
pursue
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
merely
add
:
"
You
will
know
hereafter
,
darling
,
why
I
wish
you
to
avoid
his
house
and
family
;
now
return
to
your
old
employment
and
amusement
,
and
think
no
more
about
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
kiss
her
father
,
and
sit
down
quietly
to
her
lesson
for
a
couple
of
hour
,
accord
to
custom
;
then
she
accompany
him
into
the
ground
,
and
the
whole
day
pass
as
usual
:
but
in
the
evening
,
when
she
have
retire
to
her
room
,
and
I
go
to
help
her
to
undress
<EOS>
,
I
find
her
crying
,
on
her
knee
by
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
fie
,
silly
child
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
any
real
griefs
you
would
be
ashamed
to
waste
a
tear
on
this
little
contrariety
.
<EOS>
You
never
have
one
shadow
of
substantial
sorrow
,
Miss
Catherine
.
<EOS>
suppose
,
for
a
minute
,
that
master
and
I
be
dead
,
and
you
be
by
yourself
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
how
would
you
feel
,
then
?
<EOS>
compare
the
present
occasion
with
such
an
affliction
as
that
,
and
be
thankful
for
the
friend
you
have
,
instead
of
covet
more

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
cry
for
myself
,
Ellen
,
"
she
answer
,
"
it
be
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
expect
to
see
me
again
to
-
morrow
,
and
there
he
will
be
so
disappointed
:
and
he
will
wait
for
me
,
and
I
sha'n't
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
do
you
imagine
he
have
think
as
much
of
you
as
you
have
of
him
?
<EOS>
have
not
he
Hareton
for
a
companion
?
<EOS>
not
one
in
a
hundred
would
weep
at
lose
a
relation
they
have
just
see
twice
,
for
two
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Linton
will
conjecture
how
it
be
,
and
trouble
himself
no
further
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
may
I
not
write
a
note
to
tell
him
why
I
can
not
come
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
rise
to
her
foot
.
"
<EOS>
and
just
send
those
book
I
promise
to
lend
him
?
<EOS>
His
book
be
not
as
nice
as
mine
,
and
he
want
to
have
them
extremely
,
when
I
tell
him
how
interesting
they
be
.
<EOS>
May
I
not
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
reply
I
with
decision
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
would
write
to
you
,
and
there
'd
never
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
no
,
Miss
Catherine
,
the
acquaintance
must
be
drop
entirely
:
so
papa
expect
,
and
I
shall
see
that
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
can
one
little
note
 
?
<EOS>
"
she
recommence
,
put
on
an
imploring
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
"
I
interrupt
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
begin
with
your
little
note
.
<EOS>
get
into
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
throw
at
me
a
very
naughty
look
,
so
naughty
that
I
would
not
kiss
her
good
-
night
at
first
<EOS>
:
I
cover
her
up
,
and
shut
her
door
,
in
great
displeasure
;
but
,
repent
half
-
way
,
I
return
softly
,
and
lo
!
<EOS>
there
be
Miss
stand
at
the
table
with
a
bit
of
blank
paper
before
her
and
a
pencil
in
her
hand
,
which
she
guiltily
slip
out
of
sight
on
my
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
nobody
to
take
that
,
Catherine
,
"
I
say
,
"
if
you
write
it
;
and
at
present
I
shall
put
out
your
candle
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
the
extinguisher
on
the
flame
,
receive
as
I
do
so
a
slap
on
my
hand
and
a
petulant
"
cross
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
then
quit
her
again
,
and
she
draw
the
bolt
in
one
of
her
bad
,
most
peevish
humour
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
finish
and
forward
to
its
destination
by
a
milk
-
fetcher
who
come
from
the
village
;
but
that
I
do
not
learn
till
some
time
afterwards
.
<EOS>
week
pass
on
,
and
Cathy
recover
her
temper
;
though
she
grow
wondrous
fond
of
steal
off
to
corner
by
herself
and
often
,
if
I
come
near
her
suddenly
while
read
,
she
would
start
and
bend
over
the
book
,
evidently
desirous
to
hide
it
;
and
I
detect
edge
of
loose
paper
stick
out
beyond
the
leave
.
<EOS>
She
also
get
a
trick
of
come
down
early
in
the
morning
and
linger
about
the
kitchen
,
as
if
she
be
expect
the
arrival
of
something
;
and
she
have
a
small
drawer
in
a
cabinet
in
the
library
,
which
she
would
trifle
over
for
hour
,
and
whose
key
she
take
special
care
to
remove
when
she
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
as
she
inspect
this
drawer
,
I
observe
that
the
plaything
and
trinket
which
recently
form
its
content
be
transmute
into
bit
of
fold
paper
.
<EOS>
My
curiosity
and
suspicion
be
rouse
;
I
determine
to
take
a
peep
at
her
mysterious
treasure
;
so
,
at
night
,
as
soon
as
she
and
my
master
be
safe
upstairs
,
I
search
,
and
readily
find
among
my
house
key
one
that
would
fit
the
lock
.
<EOS>
have
open
,
I
empty
the
whole
content
into
my
apron
,
and
take
them
with
me
to
examine
at
leisure
in
my
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
though
I
could
not
but
suspect
,
I
be
still
surprised
to
discover
that
they
be
a
mass
of
correspondence
 
daily
almost
<EOS>
,
it
must
have
be
 
from
Linton
Heathcliff
:
<EOS>
answer
to
document
forward
by
her
.
<EOS>
the
earlier
date
be
embarrassed
and
short
;
gradually
,
however
,
they
expand
into
copious
love
-
letter
,
foolish
,
as
the
age
of
the
writer
render
natural
,
yet
with
touch
here
and
there
which
I
think
be
borrow
from
a
more
experienced
source
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
strike
me
as
singularly
odd
compound
of
ardour
and
flatness
;
commence
in
strong
feeling
,
and
conclude
in
the
affected
,
wordy
style
that
a
schoolboy
may
use
to
a
fancied
,
incorporeal
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
whether
they
satisfy
Cathy
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
;
but
they
appear
very
worthless
trash
to
me
.
<EOS>
after
turn
over
as
many
as
I
think
proper
,
I
tie
them
in
a
handkerchief
and
set
them
aside
,
relocke
the
vacant
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
follow
her
habit
,
my
young
lady
descend
early
,
and
visit
the
kitchen
:
I
watch
her
go
to
the
door
,
on
the
arrival
of
a
certain
little
boy
;
and
,
while
the
dairymaid
fill
his
can
,
she
tuck
something
into
his
jacket
pocket
,
and
pluck
something
out
.
<EOS>
I
go
round
by
the
garden
,
and
lay
wait
for
the
messenger
;
who
fight
valorously
to
defend
his
trust
,
and
we
spilt
the
milk
between
us
;
but
I
succeed
in
abstract
the
epistle
;
and
,
threaten
serious
consequence
if
he
do
not
look
sharp
home
,
I
remain
under
the
wall
and
peruse
Miss
Cathy
's
affectionate
composition
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
simple
and
more
eloquent
than
her
cousin
's
:
very
pretty
and
very
silly
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
,
and
go
meditate
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
wet
,
she
could
not
divert
herself
with
ramble
about
the
park
;
so
,
at
the
conclusion
of
her
morning
study
,
she
resort
to
the
solace
of
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
Her
father
sit
read
at
the
table
;
and
I
,
on
purpose
,
have
seek
a
bit
of
work
in
some
unrip
fringe
of
the
window
-
curtain
,
keep
my
eye
steadily
fix
on
her
proceeding
.
<EOS>
never
do
any
bird
fly
back
to
a
plundered
nest
,
which
it
have
leave
brimful
of
chirp
young
one
,
express
more
complete
despair
,
in
its
anguished
cry
and
fluttering
,
than
she
by
her
single
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
and
the
change
that
transfigure
her
late
happy
countenance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
look
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
love
?
<EOS>
have
you
hurt
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
His
tone
and
look
assure
her
_
<EOS>
he
_
have
not
be
the
discoverer
of
the
hoard
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
papa
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasp
.
"
<EOS>
Ellen
!
<EOS>
Ellen
!
<EOS>
come
up
-
stair
 
<EOS>
I
be
sick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obey
her
summon
,
and
accompany
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
you
have
get
them

"
she
commence
immediately
,
drop
on
her
knee
,
when
we

alone

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

give
them
to
me

and
I
will
never
,
never
do
so
again

<EOS>
do
not
tell
papa

<EOS>
You
have
not
tell
papa
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
say
you
have
not
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
exceedingly
naughty
,
but
I
will
not
do
it
any
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
with
a
grave
severity
in
my
manner
I
bid
her
stand
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
"
I
exclaim
,
"
Miss
Catherine
,
you
be
tolerably
far
on
<EOS>
,
it
seem
:
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
them
!
<EOS>
a
fine
bundle
of
trash
you
study
in
your
leisure
hour
,
to
be
sure
<EOS>
:
why
,
it
be
good
enough
to
be
print
!
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
suppose
the
master
will
think
when
I
display
it
before
him
?
<EOS>
I
hav'n"t
show
it
yet
,
but
you
need
not
imagine
I
shall
keep
your
ridiculous
secret
.
<EOS>
for
shame
!
<EOS>
and
you
must
have
lead
the
way
in
write
such
absurdity
:
he
would
not
have
think
of
beginning
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
!
"
<EOS>
sob
Cathy
,
fit
to
break
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
once
think
of
love
him
till
 
"
  
"
_
Loving
_

<EOS>
cry
I
,
as
scornfully
as
I
could
utter
the
word
.
"
<EOS>
_
Loving
_
!
<EOS>
do
anybody
ever
hear
the
like
!
<EOS>
I
may
just
as
well
talk
of
love
the
miller
who
come
once
a
year
to
buy
our
corn
.
<EOS>
pretty
loving
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
both
time
together
you
have
see
Linton
hardly
four
hour
in
your
life
!
<EOS>
now
here
be
the
babyish
trash
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
with
it
to
the
library
;
and
we
will
see
what
your
father
say
to
such
_
love
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spring
at
her
precious
epistle
,
but
I
hold
them
above
my
head
;
and
then
she
pour
out
further
frantic
entreaty
that
I
would
burn
them
 
<EOS>
do
anything
rather
than
show
them
.
<EOS>
and
be
really
fully
as
much
incline
to
laugh
as
scold
 
<EOS>
for
I
esteem
it
all
girlish
vanity
 
<EOS>
I
at
length
relent
in
a
measure
,
and
ask
,
 
"
if
I
consent
to
burn
them
,
will
you
promise
faithfully
neither
to
send
nor
receive
a
letter
again
,
nor
a
book
(
for
I
perceive
you
have
send
him
book
)
,
nor
lock
of
hair
,
nor
ring
,
nor
plaything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
send
plaything
,
"
cry
Catherine
,
her
pride
overcome
her
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
anything
at
all
,
then
,
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
unless
you
will
,
here
I
go

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
,
Ellen

"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
catch
my
dress
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
put
them
in
the
fire
,
do
,
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
proceed
to
open
a
place
with
the
poker
the
sacrifice
be
too
painful
to
be
bear
.
<EOS>
She
earnestly
supplicate
that
I
would
spare
her
one
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
or
two
,
Ellen
,
to
keep
for
Linton
's
sake
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
unknotte
the
handkerchief
,
and
commence
drop
them
in
from
an
angle
,
and
the
flame
curl
up
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
one
,
you
cruel
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
she
scream
,
dart
her
hand
into
the
fire
,
and
draw
forth
some
half
-
consume
fragment
,
at
the
expense
of
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
have
some
to
exhibit
to
papa
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
shake
back
the
rest
into
the
bundle
,
and
turn
anew
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
She
empty
her
blacken
piece
into
the
flame
,
and
motion
me
to
finish
the
immolation
.
<EOS>
It
be
do
;
I
stir
up
the
ashe
,
and
inter
them
under
a
shovelful
of
coal
;
and
she
mutely
,
and
with
a
sense
of
intense
injury
,
retire
to
her
private
apartment
.
<EOS>
I
descend
to
tell
my
master
that
the
young
lady
's
qualm
of
sickness
be
almost
go
,
but
I
judge
it
best
for
her
to
lie
down
a
while
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
dine
;
but
she
reappear
at
tea
,
pale
,
and
red
about
the
eye
,
and
marvellously
subdue
in
outward
aspect
.
<EOS>
next
morning
I
answer
the
letter
by
a
slip
of
paper
,
inscribe
,
"
Master
Heathcliff
be
request
to
send
no
more
note
to
Miss
Linton
,
as
she
will
not
receive
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
henceforth
,
the
little
boy
come
with
vacant
pocket
.
    
<EOS>
Summer
draw
to
an
end
,
and
early
autumn
:
it
be
past
Michaelmas
,
but
the
harvest
be
late
that
year
,
and
a
few
of
our
field
be
still
uncleare
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
and
his
daughter
would
frequently
walk
out
among
the
reaper
;
at
the
carrying
of
the
last
sheaf
they
stay
till
dusk
,
and
the
evening
happen
to
be
chill
and
damp
,
my
master
catch
a
bad
cold
,
that
settle
obstinately
on
his
lung
,
and
confine
him
indoor
throughout
the
whole
of
the
winter
,
nearly
without
intermission
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Cathy
,
frighten
from
her
little
romance
,
have
be
considerably
sad
and
dull
since
its
abandonment
;
and
her
father
insist
on
her
read
less
,
and
take
more
exercise
.
<EOS>
She
have
his
companionship
no
longer
;
I
esteem
it
a
duty
to
supply
its
lack
,
as
much
as
possible
,
with
mine
:
an
inefficient
substitute
;
for
I
could
only
spare
two
or
three
hour
,
from
my
numerous
diurnal
occupation
,
to
follow
her
footstep
,
and
then
my
society
be
obviously
less
desirable
than
his
.
  
<EOS>
on
an
afternoon
in
October
,
or
the
beginning
of
November
 
a
fresh
watery
afternoon
,
when
the
turf
and
path
be
rustle
with
moist
,
withered
leave
,
and
the
cold
blue
sky
be
half
hide
by
cloud
 
dark
grey
streamer
,
rapidly
mount
from
the
west
,
and
bode
abundant
rain
 
<EOS>
I
request
my
young
lady
to
forego
her
ramble
,
because
I
be
certain
of
shower
.
<EOS>
She
refuse
;
and
I
unwillingly
don
a
cloak
,
and
take
my
umbrella
to
accompany
her
on
a
stroll
to
the
bottom
of
the
park
:
a
formal
walk
which
she
generally
affect
if
low
-
spirited
 
and
that
she
invariably
be
when
Mr.
Edgar
have
be
bad
than
ordinary
,
a
thing
never
know
from
his
confession
,
but
guess
both
by
her
and
me
from
his
increase
silence
and
the
melancholy
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
go
sadly
on
<EOS>
:
there
be
no
run
or
bound
now
,
though
the
chill
wind
may
well
have
tempt
her
to
race
.
<EOS>
and
often
,
from
the
side
of
my
eye
,
I
could
detect
her
raise
a
hand
,
and
brush
something
off
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
I
gaze
round
for
a
means
of
divert
her
thought
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
of
the
road
rise
a
high
,
rough
bank
,
where
hazel
and
stunted
oak
,
with
their
root
half
expose
,
hold
uncertain
tenure
:
the
soil
be
too
loose
for
the
latter
;
and
strong
wind
have
blow
some
nearly
horizontal
.
<EOS>
in
summer
Miss
Catherine
delight
to
climb
along
these
trunk
,
and
sit
in
the
branch
,
swinge
twenty
foot
above
the
ground
;
and
I
,
please
with
her
agility
and
her
light
,
childish
heart
,
still
consider
it
proper
to
scold
every
time
I
catch
her
at
such
an
elevation
,
but
so
that
she
know
there
be
no
necessity
for
descend
.
<EOS>
from
dinner
to
tea
she
would
lie
in
her
breeze
-
rock
cradle
,
do
nothing
except
singe
old
song
 
<EOS>
my
nursery
lore
 
to
herself
,
or
watch
the
bird
,
joint
tenant
,
feed
and
entice
their
young
one
to
fly
:
or
nestle
with
closed
lid
,
<EOS>
half
thinking
,
half
dream
,
happy
than
word
can
express
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
,
Miss

"
I
exclaim
,
point
to
a
nook
under
the
root
of
one
twisted
tree

"
<EOS>
winter

be
a

flower
up
yonder
,
the
last
bud
from
the
multitude
of
bluebell
that
cloud
those

step
in
July
with
a

mist

<EOS>
Will
you
clamber
up
,
and
pluck
it
to
show
to

<EOS>
Cathy
stare
a
long
time
at
the
lonely
blossom
tremble
in
its
earthy
shelter
,
and
reply
,
at
length
 
<EOS>
"
no

I
will
not
touch
it

but
it
look
melancholy
,
do
it
not
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
observe
,
"
about
as
starve
and
suckless
as
you
:
your
cheek
be
bloodless
;
let
us
take
hold
of
hand
and
run
.
<EOS>
You
be
so
low
,
I
daresay
I
shall
keep
up
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
she
repeat
,
and
continue
saunter
on
,
pause
at
interval
to
muse
over
a
bit
of
moss
,
or
a
tuft
of
blanched
grass
,
or
a
fungus
spread
its
bright
orange
among
the
heap
of
brown
foliage
;
and
,
ever
and
anon
,
her
hand
be
lift
to
her
averted
face

<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
why
be
you
cry
,
love
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
approach
and
put
my
arm
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
cry
because
papa
have
a
cold
;
be
thankful
it
be
nothing
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
now
put
no
further
restraint
on
her
tear
;
her
breath
be
stifle
by
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
will
be
something
bad
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
what
shall
I
do
when
papa
<EOS>
and
you
leave
me
,
and
I
be
by
myself

<EOS>
I
can
not
forget
your
word
,
Ellen
;
they
be
always
in
my
ear

<EOS>
how
life
will
be
change

how
dreary
the
world
will
be
,
when

you
be
dead

<EOS>
"
none
can
tell
whether
you
will
not
die
before
us

"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
wrong
to
anticipate
evil
.
<EOS>
We
will
hope
there
be
year
and
year
to
come
before
any
of
us
go
:
master
be
young

and
I
be
strong

hardly
forty

five

My

live
till
eighty

suppose
Mr.

sixty

that
would
be
more

She

I
will
not

you
may
kill
him

you
be
wild

reckless

cherish
a
foolish

fanciful
affection
for
the
son
of
a
person
who
would
be
glad
to
have
him
in
his
grave

allow
him

judge
it

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I

I
know
it
by

I
pray
every
night
that
I
may
live
after

<EOS>

good

deed
must
prove

also

remember

resolution
form

<EOS>
as
we
talk
,
we
near
a
door
that
open
on
the
road
;
and
my
young
lady
,
lighten
into
sunshine
again
,
climb
up
and
seat
herself
on
the
top
of
the
wall
,
reach
over
to
gather
some
hip
that
bloom
scarlet
on
the
summit
branch
of
the
wild
-
rise
tree
shadow
the
highway
side
:
the
low
fruit
have
disappear
,
but
only
bird
could
touch
the
upper
,
except
from
Cathy

present
station

<EOS>
in
stretch
to
pull
them
,
her
hat
fall
off
;
and
as
the
door
be
lock
,
she
propose
scramble
down
to
recover
it
.
<EOS>
I
bid
her
be
cautious
lest
she
get
a
fall
,
and
she
nimbly
disappear
.
<EOS>
but
the
return
be
no
such
easy
matter
:
the
stone
be
smooth
and
neatly
cement
,
and
the
rose
-
bush
and
black
-
berry
straggler
could
yield
no
assistance
in
re
-
ascending
.
<EOS>
I
,
like
a
fool
,
do
not
recollect
that
,
till
I
hear
her
laugh
and
exclaim
 
"
Ellen
!
<EOS>
you
will
have
to
fetch
the
key
,
or
else
I
must
run
round

stay

I
answer
;

I

my

Catherine
amuse
herself
with
dance
to

fro
before
the
door

I
try
all
the
large
key

I
have
apply
the

find
that
none

repeat
my

I
do

him

I
demand
your
attention

<EOS>
yes

you

cause
to
blush

<EOS>
two

three
month

you
not

love
in
play

<EOS>
You
deserve

both

<EOS>
You
especially

the

I

get
your

if
you
give
me
any
pertness
I
will
send
them

I

you
grow
weary

drop
it

do
not
you

<EOS>
well

you
drop
Linton
with
it
into

Slough

Despond

He

in

in
love

really

<EOS>
as
true
as
I

he
be
die

break
his

not
figuratively

actually

Miss

Catherine
Linton
(
the

me

my
bonny
lass

I
shall
be
from

all
this

go
and
see
if
have
not
speak
truth

:
do
,
there
be
a
darling
!
<EOS>
just
imagine
your

in

place

Linton
in
yours
;
then
think
how
you
would
value
your
careless
lover
if
he
refuse
to
stir
a
step
to
comfort
you
,
when
your
father
himself
entreat
him
;
and
do
not
,
from
pure
stupidity
,
fall
into
the

error

I

on

go
to

none

you

save

out

I

die

look
hard

grief

disappointment
be
hasten
his
death

<EOS>
nelly
,
if
you
will
not
let
her
go
,
you
can
walk
over
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
return
till
this
time
next
week
;
and
I
think
your
master
himself
would
scarcely
object
to
her
visit
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
say
I
,
take
Cathy
by
the
arm
and
half
force
her
to
re
-
enter
;
for
she
linger
,
view
with
troubled
eye
the
feature
of
the
speaker
,
too
stern
to
express
his
inward
deceit

<EOS>
He
push
his
horse
close
,
and
,
bend
down
,
observe
 
"
Miss
Catherine
<EOS>
,
I
will
own
to
you
that
I
have
little
patience
with
Linton
;
and
Hareton
and
Joseph
have
less
.
<EOS>
I
will
own
that
he
be
with
a
harsh
set
.
<EOS>
He
pine
for
kindness
,
as
well
as
love
;
and
a
kind
word
from
you
would
be
his
good
medicine
.
<EOS>
do
not
mind
Mrs.
Dean
's
cruel
caution
;
but
be
generous
,
and
contrive
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
dream
of
you
day
and
night
,
and
can
not
be
persuade
that
you
do
not
hate
him
,
since
you
neither
write
nor
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
close
the
door
,
and
roll
a
stone
to
assist
the
loosen
lock
in
hold
it
;
and
spread
my
umbrella
,
I
draw
my
charge
underneath
:
for
the
rain
begin
to
drive
through
the
moan
branch
of
the
tree
,
and
warn
us
to
avoid
delay
.
<EOS>
Our
hurry
prevent
any
comment
on
the
encounter
with
Heathcliff
,
as
we
stretch
towards
home
;
but
I
divine
instinctively
that
Catherine
's
heart
be
cloud
now
in
double
darkness
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
be
so
sad
,
they
do
not
seem
her
:
she
evidently
regard
what
she
have
hear
as
every
syllable
true
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
have
retire
to
rest
before
we
come
in
.
<EOS>
cathy
stole
to
his
room
to
inquire
how
he
be
;
he
have
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
She
return
,
and
ask
me
to
sit
with
her
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
We
take
our
tea
together
;
and
afterwards
she
lie
down
on
the
rug
,
and
tell
me
not
to
talk
,
for
she
be
weary
.
<EOS>
I
get
a
book
,
and
pretend
to
read
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
suppose
me
absorb
in
my
occupation
,
she
recommence
her
silent
weeping
:
it
appear
,
at
present
,
her
favourite
diversion
.
<EOS>
I
suffer
her
to
enjoy
it
a
while
;
then
I
expostulate
:
deride
and
ridicule
all
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
assertion
about
his
son
,
as
if
I
be
certain
she
would
coincide
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
skill
to
counteract
the
effect
his
account
have
produce
:
it
be
just
what
he
intend
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
right
,
Ellen
,
"
she
answer
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
never
feel
at
ease
till
I
know
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
tell
Linton
it
be
not
my
fault
that
I
do
not
write
,
and
convince
him
that
I
shall
not
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
use
be
anger
and
protestation
against
her
silly
credulity
?
<EOS>
We
part
that
night
 
hostile
;
but
next
day
beheld
me
on
the
road
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
by
the
side
of
my
wilful
young
mistress
's
pony
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
witness
her
sorrow
:
to
see
her
pale
,
dejected
countenance
,
and
heavy
eye
:
and
I
yield
,
in
the
faint
hope
that
Linton
himself
may
prove
,
by
his
reception
of
us
,
how
little
of
the
tale
be
found
on
fact
.
    
<EOS>
the
rainy
night
have
usher
in
a
misty
morning
 
<EOS>
half
frost
,
half
drizzle
 
and
temporary
brook
cross
our
path
 
gurgle
from
the
upland
.
<EOS>
My
foot
be
thoroughly
wet
;
I
be
cross
and
low
;
exactly
the
humour
suit
for
make
the
most
of
these
disagreeable
thing
.
<EOS>
We
enter
the
farm
-
house
by
the
kitchen
way
,
to
ascertain
whether
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
really
absent
:
because
I
put
slight
faith
in
his
own
affirmation
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
seem
sit
in
a
sort
of
elysium
alone
,
beside
a
roar
fire
;
a
quart
of
ale
on
the
table
near
him
,
bristle
with
large
piece
of
toast
oat
-
cake
;
and
his
black
,
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
Catherine
run
to
the
hearth
to
warm
herself
.
<EOS>
I
ask
if
the
master
be
in
?
<EOS>
My
question
remain
so
long
unanswered
,
that
I
think
the
old
man
have
grow
deaf
,
and
repeat
it
louder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
 
ay
!
"
<EOS>
he
snarl
,
or
rather
scream
through
his
nose
.

cry
a
peevish
voice
,
simultaneously
with
me
,
from
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
"
how
often
be
I
to
call
you
?
<EOS>
there
be
only
a
few
red
ashe
now

Joseph
!
<EOS>
come
this
moment

"
  
<EOS>
vigorous
puff
,
and
a
resolute
stare
into
the
grate
,
declare
he
have
no
ear
for
this
appeal
.
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
and
Hareton
be
invisible
;
one
go
on
an
errand
,
and
the
other
at
his
work
,
probably
.
<EOS>
We
know
Linton
's
tone
,
and
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
hope
you
will
die
in
a
garret
,
starve
to
death
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
boy
,
mistake
our
approach
for
that
of
his
negligent
attendant
.
  
<EOS>
He
stop
on
observe
his
error
:
his
cousin
fly
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
you
,
Miss
Linton
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
raise
his
head
from
the
arm
of
the
great
chair
,
in
which
he
recline
.
"
<EOS>
no
 
do
not
kiss
me
:
it
take
my
breath

<EOS>
dear
me
!
<EOS>
Papa
say
you
would
call

continue
he
,
after
recover
a
little
from
Catherine
's
embrace
;
while
she
stand
by
look
very
contrite
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
shut
the
door
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
you
leave
it
open
;
and
those
 
those
_
detestable
_
creature
will
not
bring
coal
to
the
fire

<EOS>
It
be
so
cold
!

<EOS>
I
stir
up
the
cinder
,
and
fetch
a
scuttleful
myself
.
<EOS>
the
invalid
complain
of
be
cover
with
ashe
;
but
he
have
a
tiresome
cough
,
and
look
feverish
and
ill
,
so
I
do
not
rebuke
his
temper

well

murmured
Catherine
,
when
his
corrugate
brow
relaxed

Can
I
do
you
any
good

not

come

tire
me
dreadfully

long

would
far
rather

talk

into

add

bottle
on

swallow

you

no

I
should
never
love
anybody
well
than
papa

she
return
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
and
people
hate
their
wife
,
sometimes
;
but
not
their
sister
and
brother
:
and
if
you
be
the
latter
,
you
would
live
with
us
,

papa
would
be
as
fond
of
you
as
he
be
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
deny
that
people
ever
hate
their
wife
;
but
Cathy
affirm
they
do
,
and
,
in
her
wisdom
,
instance
his
own
father
's
aversion
to
her
aunt

<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
stop
her
thoughtless
tongue

<EOS>
I
could
not
succeed

Papa

Catherine

you
be
very
naughty

He

sing
Linton
,
sink
into
the
recess
of
his
chair
,
and
lean
back
his
head
to
enjoy
the
agitation
of
the
other
disputant
,
who
stand
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Master
Heathcliff
!
"
<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
Cathy
,
beside
herself
,
give
the
chair
a
violent
push
,
and
cause
him
to
fall
against
one
arm
.
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
seize
by
a
suffocate
cough
that
soon
end
his
triumph
.
<EOS>
It
last
so
long
that
it
frighten
even
me
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
cousin
,
she
weep
with
all
her
might
,
aghast
at
the
mischief
she
have
do
:
though
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
hold
him
till
the
fit
exhaust
itself
.
<EOS>
then
he
thrust
me
away
,
and
leant
his
head
down
silently
.
<EOS>
Catherine
quell
her
lamentation
also
,
take
a
seat
opposite
,
and
look
solemnly
into
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
feel
now
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
after
wait
ten
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
_
<EOS>
she
_
feel
as
I
do

,
"
he
reply
:
"
spiteful
,
cruel
thing
!
<EOS>
Hareton
never
touch
me
:
he
never
strike
me
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
well
to
-
day
:
and
there
 
"
his
voice
die
in
a
whimper
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
do
not
strike
you
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
Cathy
,
chew
her
lip
to
prevent
another
burst
of
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
He
sigh
and
moan
like
one
under
great
suffering
,
and
keep
it
up
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
on
purpose
to
distress
his
cousin
apparently
,
for
whenever
he
catch
a
stifled
sob
from
her
he
put
renew
pain
and
pathos
into
the
inflexion
of
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
<EOS>
I
hurt
you
,
Linton
,
"
she
say
at
length
,
rack
beyond
endurance
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
could
not
have
be
hurt
by
that
little
push
,
and
I
have
no
idea
<EOS>
that
you
could
,
either
:
you
be
not
much
,
be
you
,
Linton
?
<EOS>
do
not
let
me
go
home
think
<EOS>
I
have
do
you
harm
.
<EOS>
answer
!
<EOS>
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
speak
to
you
,
<EOS>
"
he
murmur
;
"
you
have
hurt
me
so
that
I
shall
lie
awake
all
night
choke
with
this
cough
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
it
you
would
know
what
it
be
;
but
_
you
will
_
be
comfortably
asleep
while
I
be
in
agony
,
and
nobody
near
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
you
would
like
to
pass
those
fearful
night
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
begin
to
wail
aloud
,
for
very
pity
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
since
you
be
in
the
habit
of
pass
dreadful
night
,
"
I
say
,
"
it
will
not
be
Miss
who
spoil
your
ease
:
you
would
be
the
same
<EOS>
have
she
never
come
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
shall
not
disturb
you
again
;
and
perhaps
you
will
get
quieter
when
we
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
go
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Catherine
dolefully
,
bend
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
me
to
go
,
Linton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
alter
what
you
have
do
,
"
he
reply
pettishly
,
shrink
from
her
,
"
unless
you
alter
it
for
the
bad
by
tease
me
into
a
fever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
must
go
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
alone
,
at
least
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
can
not
bear
your
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
linger
,
and
resist
my
persuasion
to
departure
a
tiresome
while
;
but
as
he
neither
look
up
nor
speak
,
she
finally
make
a
movement
to
the
door
,
and
I
follow
.
<EOS>
We
be
recall
by
a
scream
.
<EOS>
Linton
have
slide
from
his
seat
on
to
the
hearthstone
,
and
lie
writhe
in
the
mere
perverseness
of
an
indulged
plague
of
a
child
,
determine
to
be
as
grievous
and
harass
as
it
can
.
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
gauge
his
disposition
from
his
behaviour
,
and
see
at
once
it
would
be
folly
to
attempt
humour
him
.
<EOS>
not
so
my
companion
:
she
run
back
in
terror
,
knelt
down
,
and
cry
,
and
soothe
,
and
entreat
,
till
he
grow
quiet
from
lack
of
breath
:
by
no
mean
from
compunction
at
distress
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lift
him
on
to
the
settle
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
he
may
roll
about
as
he
please
:
we
can
not
stop
to
watch
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
satisfied
,
Miss
Cathy
,
that
you
be
not
the
person
to
benefit
him
;
and
that
his
condition
of
health
be
not
occasion
by
attachment
to
you
.
<EOS>
now
,
then
,
there
he
be
!
<EOS>
come
away
:
as
soon
as
he
know
there
be
nobody
by
to
care
for
his
nonsense
,
he
will
be
glad
to
lie
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
place
a
cushion
under
his
head
,
and
offer
him
some
water
;
he
reject
the
latter
,
and
toss
uneasily
on
the
former
,
as
if
it
be
a
stone
or
a
block
of
wood
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
put
it
more
comfortably
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
with
that
,
"
he
say
;
"
it
be
not
high
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
bring
another
to
lay
above
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
too
high
,
"
murmur
the
provoking
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
must
I
arrange
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
despairingly
.
  
<EOS>
He
twine
himself
up
to
her
,
as
she
half
knelt
by
the
settle
,
and
convert
her
shoulder
into
a
support
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
will
not
do
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
content
with
the
cushion
,
Master
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Miss
have
waste
too
much
time
on
you
already
:
we
can
not
remain
five
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
we
can
!
"
reply
Cathy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
good
and
patient
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
think
I
shall
have
far
great
misery
<EOS>
than
he
will
to
-
night
,
if
I
believe
he
be
the
bad
for
my
visit
:
and
then
I
dare
not
come
again
.
<EOS>
tell
the
truth
about
it
,
Linton
;
for
I
musn't
come
,
if
I
have
hurt
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
,
to
cure
me
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
come
,
because
you
have
hurt
me
:
you
know
you
have
extremely
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
as
ill
when
you
enter
as
I
be
at
present
 
<EOS>
be
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
make
yourself
ill
by
cry
and
be
in
a
passion
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
do
it
all
,
"
say
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
we
will
be
friend
now
.
<EOS>
and
you
want
me
:
you
would
wish
to
see
me
sometimes
,
really
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
do
,
"
he
reply
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
sit
on
the
settle
and
let
me
lean
on
your
knee
.
<EOS>
that
be
as
mamma
use
to
do
,
whole
afternoon
together
.
<EOS>
sit
quite
still
and
do
not
talk
:
but
you
may
sing
a
song
,
if
you
can
sing
;
or
you
may
say
a
nice
long
interesting
ballad
 
one
of
those
you
promise
to
teach
me
;
or
a
story
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
a
ballad
,
though
:
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
repeat
the
long
she
could
remember
.
<EOS>
the
employment
please
both
mightily
.
<EOS>
Linton
would
have
another
,
and
after
that
another
,
notwithstanding
my
strenuous
objection
;
and
so
they
go
on
until
the
clock
strike
twelve
,
and
we
hear
Hareton
in
the
court
,
return
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
to
-
morrow
,
Catherine
,
will
you
be
here
to
-
morrow
?
"
ask
young
Heathcliff
,
hold
her
frock
as
she
rise
reluctantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
answer
,
"
nor
next
day
neither
.
<EOS>
"
She
,
however
,
give
a
different
response
evidently
,
for
his
forehead
clear
as
she
stoop
and
whisper
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
go
to
-
morrow
,
recollect
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
"
I
commence
,
when
we
be
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
dream
of
it
,
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
take
good
care
,
"
I
continue
:
"
I
will
have
that
lock
mend
,
and
you
can
escape
by
no
way
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
get
over
the
wall
,
"
she
say
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Grange
be
not
a
prison
,
Ellen
,
and
you
be
not
my
gaoler
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
I
be
almost
seventeen
:
I
be
a
woman
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
certain
Linton
would
recover
quickly
if
he
have
me
to
look
after
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
old
than
he
be
,
you
know
,
and
wise
:
<EOS>
less
childish
,
be
I
not
?
<EOS>
and
he
will
soon
do
as
I
direct
him
,
with
some
slight
coaxing
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
pretty
little
darling
when
he
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
would
make
such
a
pet
of
him
,
if
he
be
mine
.
<EOS>
We
should
never
quarrel
,
should
we
after
we
be
use
to
each
other
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
like
him
,
Ellen
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
like
him
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
the
worst
-
temper
bit
of
a
sickly
slip
that
ever
struggle
into
its
teen
.
<EOS>
happily
,
as
Mr.
Heathcliff
conjecture
,
he
will
not
win
twenty
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
will
see
spring
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
and
small
loss
to
his
family
whenever
he
drop
off
.
<EOS>
and
lucky
it
be
for
us
that
his
father
take
him
:
the
kinder
he
be
treat
,
the
more
tedious
and
selfish
he
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
have
no
chance
of
have
him
for
a
husband
,
Miss
Catherine
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
companion
wax
serious
at
hear
this
speech
.
<EOS>
to
speak
of
his
death
so
regardlessly
wound
her
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
young
than
I
,
"
she
answer
,
after
a
protract
pause
of
meditation
,
"
and
he
ought
to
live
the
long
:
he
will
 
he
must
live
as
long
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
strong
now
as
when
he
first
come
into
the
north
;
I
be
positive
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
cold
that
ail
him
,
the
same
as
papa
have
.
<EOS>
You
say
papa
will
get
well
,
and
why
should
not
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,

I
cry
,
"
<EOS>
after
all
,
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
;
for
listen
,
Miss
,
 
and
mind
,
I
will
keep
my
word
,
 
if
you
attempt
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
again
,
with
or
without
me
,
I
shall
inform
Mr.
Linton
,
and
,
unless
he
allow
it
,
the
intimacy
with
your
cousin
must
not
be
revive

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
revive

"
mutter
Cathy
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
not
be
continue
,
then
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
,
"
be
her
reply
,
and
she
set
off
at
a
gallop
,
leave
me
to
toil
in
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
reach
home
before
our
dinner
-
time
;
my
master
suppose
we
have
be
wander
through
the
park
,
and
therefore
he
demand
no
explanation
of
our
absence
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
enter
I
hasten
to
change
my
soak
shoe
and
stocking
;
but
sit
such
awhile
at
the
Heights
have
do
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
on
the
succeed
morning
I
be
lay
up
,
and
during
three
week
I
remain
incapacitate
for
attend
to
my
duty
:
a
calamity
never
experience
prior
to
that
period
,
and
never
,
I
be
thankful
to
say
,
since
.
  
<EOS>
My
little
mistress
behave
like
an
angel
in
come
to
wait
on
me
,
and
cheer
my
solitude
;
the
confinement
bring
me
exceedingly
low
.
<EOS>
It
be
wearisome
,
to
a
stirring
active
body
:
but
few
have
slighter
reason
for
complaint
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
the
moment
Catherine
leave
Mr.
Linton
's
room
she
appear
at
my
bedside
.
<EOS>
Her
day
be
divide
between
us
;
no
amusement
usurp
a
minute
:
she
neglect
her
meal
,
her
study
,
and
her
play
;
and
she
be
the
fond
nurse
that
ever
watch
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
have
a
warm
heart
,
when
she
love
her
father
so
,
to
give
so
much
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
say
her
day
be
divide
between
us
;
but
the
master
retire
early
,
and
I
generally
need
nothing
after
six
o'clock
,
<EOS>
thus
the
evening
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
never
consider
what
she
do
with
herself
after
tea
.
<EOS>
and
though
frequently
,
when
she
look
in
to
bid
me
good
-
night
,
I
remark
a
fresh
colour
in
her
cheek
and
a
pinkness
over
her
slender
finger
,
instead
of
fancy
the
line
borrow
from
a
cold
ride
across
the
moor
,
I
lay
it
to
the
charge
of
a
hot
fire
in
the
library
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
close
of
three
week
I
be
able
to
quit
my
chamber
and
move
about
the
house
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
first
occasion
of
my
sit
up
in
the
evening
I
ask
Catherine
to
read
to
me
,
because
my
eye
be
weak
.
<EOS>
We
be
in
the
library
,
the
master
have
go
to
bed
:
she
consent
,
rather
unwillingly
,
I
fancy
;
and
imagine
my
sort
of
book
do
not
suit
her
,
I
bid
her
please
herself
in
the
choice
of
what
she
peruse
.
<EOS>
She
select
one
of
her
own
favourite
,
and
get
forward
steadily
about
an
hour
;
then
come
frequent
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ellen
,
be
not
you
tired
?
<EOS>
have
not
you
well
lie
down
now
?
<EOS>
You
will
be
sick
,
keep
up
so
long
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
dear
,
I
be
not
tired
,
"
I
return
,
continually
.
  
<EOS>
perceive
me
immovable
,
she
essay
another
method
of
show
her
disrelish
for
her
occupation
.
<EOS>
It
change
to
yawning
,
and
stretching
,
and
    
"
Ellen
,
I
be
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
give
over
then
and
talk
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
bad
:
she
fret
and
sigh
,
and
look
at
her
watch
till
eight
,
and
finally
go
to
her
room
,
completely
overdo
with
sleep
;
judge
by
her
peevish
,
heavy
look
,
and
the
constant
rubbing
she
inflict
on
her
eye
.
<EOS>
the
following
night
she
seem
more
impatient
still
;
and
on
the
third
from
recover
my
company
she
complain
of
a
headache
,
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
conduct
odd
;
and
have
remain
alone
a
long
while
,
I
resolve
on
go
and
inquire
whether
she
be
well
,
and
ask
her
to
come
and
lie
on
the
sofa
,
instead
of
up
-
stair
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
no
Catherine
could
I
discover
up
-
stair
,
and
none
below
.
<EOS>
the
servant
affirm
they
have
not
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
listen
at
Mr.
Edgar
's
door
;
all
be
silence
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
her
apartment
,
extinguish
my
candle
,
and
seat
myself
in
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
the
moon
shine
bright
;
a
sprinkling
of
snow
cover
the
ground
,
and
I
reflect
that
she
may
,
possibly
,
have
take
it
into
her
head
to
walk
about
the
garden
,
for
refreshment
.
<EOS>
I
do
detect
a
figure
creep
along
the
inner
fence
of
the
park
;
but
it
be
not
my
young
mistress
:
on
its
emerging
into
the
light
,
I
recognise
one
of
the
groom
.
<EOS>
He
stand
a
considerable
period
,
view
the
carriage
-
road
through
the
ground
;
then
start
off
at
a
brisk
pace
,
as
if
he
have
detect
something
,
and
reappear
presently
,
lead
Miss
's
pony
;
and
there
she
be
,
just
dismount
,
and
walk
by
its
side
.
<EOS>
the
man
take
his
charge
stealthily
across
the
grass
towards
the
stable
.
<EOS>
Cathy
enter
by
the
casement
-
window
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
glide
noiselessly
up
to
where
I
await
her
.
<EOS>
She
put
the
door
gently
too
,
slip
off
her
snowy
shoe
,
untie
her
hat
,
and
be
proceed
,
unconscious
of
my
espionage
,
to
lay
aside
her
mantle
,
when
I
suddenly
rise
and
reveal
myself
.
<EOS>
the
surprise
petrify
her
an
instant
:
she
utter
an
inarticulate
exclamation
,
and
stand
fix
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Catherine
,
"
I
begin
,
too
vividly
impressed
by
her
recent
kindness
to
break
into
a
scold
,
"
where
have
you
be
ride
out
at
this
hour
?
<EOS>
and
why
should
you
try
to
deceive
me
by
tell
a
tale
?
<EOS>
where
have
you
be
?
<EOS>
speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
the
bottom
of
the
park
,
"
she
stammer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
tell
a
tale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
nowhere
else
?
"
I
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
be
the
muttered
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Catherine
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
have
be
do
wrong
,
or
you
would
not
be
drive
to
utter
an
untruth
to
me
.
<EOS>
that
do
grieve
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
be
three
month
ill
,
than
hear
you
frame
a
deliberate
lie
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
spring
forward
,
and
burst
into
tear
,
throw
her
arm
round
my
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Ellen
,
I
be
so
afraid
of
you
be
angry
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
promise
not
to
be
angry
,
and
you
shall
know
the
very
truth
:
I
hate
to
hide
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
sit
down
in
the
window
-
seat
;
I
assure
her
I
would
not
scold
,
whatever
her
secret
may
be
,
and
I
guess
it
,
of
course
;
so
she
commence
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
Ellen
,
and
I
have
never
miss
go
a
day
since
you
fall
ill
;
except
thrice
before
,
and
twice
after
you
leave
your
room
.
<EOS>
I
give
Michael
book
and
picture
to
prepare
Minny
every
evening
,
and
to
put
her
back
in
the
stable
:
you
must
not
scold
him
either
,
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
Heights
by
half
-
past
six
,
and
generally
stay
till
half
-
past
eight
,
and
then
gallop
home
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
amuse
myself
that
I
go
:
<EOS>
I
be
often
wretche
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
now
<EOS>
and
then
I
be
happy
:
once
in
a
week
perhaps
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
expect
there
would
be
sad
work
persuade
you
to
let
me
keep
my
word
to
Linton
:
for
I
have
engage
to
call
again
next
day
,
when
we
quit
him
;
but
,
as
you
stay
up
-
stair
on
the
morrow
,
I
escape
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
while
Michael
be
refastene
the
lock
of
the
park
door
in
the
afternoon
,
I
get
possession
of
the
key
,
and
tell
him
how
my
cousin
wish
me
to
visit
him
,
because
he
be
sick
,
and
could
not
come
to
the
grange
;
and
how
papa
would
object
to
my
going
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
negotiate
with
him
about
the
pony
.
<EOS>
He
be
fond
of
reading
,
and
he
think
of
leave
soon
to
get
married
;
so
he
offer
,
if
I
would
lend
him
book
out
of
the
library
,
to
do
what
I
wish
:
<EOS>
but
I
prefer
give
him
my
own
,
and
that
satisfy
him
better
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
my
second
visit
Linton
seem
in
lively
spirit
;
and
Zillah
(
that
be
their
housekeeper
)
make
us
a
clean
room
and
a
good
fire
,
and
tell
us
that
,
as
Joseph
be
out
at
a
prayer
-
meeting
and
Hareton
Earnshaw
be
off
with
his
dog
 
rob
our
wood
of
pheasant
,
as
I
hear
afterwards
 
we
may
do
what
we
like
.
<EOS>
She
bring
me
some
warm
wine
and
gingerbread
,
and
appear
exceedingly
good
-
natured
,
and
Linton
sit
in
the
arm
-
chair
,
and
I
in
the
little
rock
chair
on
the
hearth
-
stone
,
and
we
laugh
and
talk
so
merrily
,
and
find
so
much
to
say
:
we
plan
where
we
would
go
,
and
what
we
would
do
in
summer
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
repeat
that
,
because
you
would
call
it
silly
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
time
,
however
,
we
be
near
quarrel
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
pleasantest
manner
of
spend
a
hot
July
day
be
lie
from
morning
till
evening
on
a
bank
of
heath
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
,
with
the
bee
hum
dreamily
about
among
the
bloom
,
and
the
lark
singe
high
up
overhead
,
and
the
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
shine
steadily
and
cloudlessly
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
most
perfect
idea
of
heaven
's
happiness
:
mine
be
rock
in
a
rustle
green
tree
,
with
a
west
wind
blowing
,
and
bright
white
cloud
flit
rapidly
above
;
and
not
only
lark
,
but
throstle
,
and
blackbird
,
and
linnet
,
and
cuckoo
pour
out
music
on
every
side
,
and
the
moor
see
at
a
distance
,
break
into
cool
dusky
dell
;
but
close
by
great
swell
of
long
grass
undulate
in
wave
to
the
breeze
;
and
wood
and
sound
water
,
and
the
whole
world
awake
and
wild
with
joy
.
<EOS>
He
want
all
to
lie
in
an
ecstasy
of
peace
;
I
want
all
to
sparkle
and
dance
in
a
glorious
jubilee
.
<EOS>
I
say
his
heaven
would
be
only
half
alive
;
and
he
say
mine
would
be
drunk
:
I
say
I
should
fall
asleep
in
his
;
and
he
say
he
could
not
breathe
in
mine
,
and
begin
to
grow
very
snappish
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
we
agree
to
try
both
,
as
soon
as
the
right
weather
come
;
and
then
we
kiss
each
other
and
be
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
sit
still
an
hour
,
I
look
at
the
great
room
with
its
smooth
uncarpeted
floor
,
and
think
how
nice
it
would
be
to
play
in
,
if
we
remove
the
table
;
and
I
ask
Linton
to
call
Zillah
in
to
help
us
,
and
we
would
have
a
game
at
blindman's
-
buff
;
she
should
try
to
catch
us
:
<EOS>
you
use
to
,
you
know
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
:
there
be
no
pleasure
in
it
,
he
say
;
but
he
consent
to
play
at
ball
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
find
two
in
a
cupboard
,
among
a
heap
of
old
toy
,
top
,
and
hoop
,
and
battledore
and
shuttlecock
.
<EOS>
one
be
mark
C.
,
and
the
other
H.
;
I
wish
to
have
the
C.
,
because
that
stand
for
Catherine
,
and
the
H.
may
be
for
Heathcliff
,
his
name
;
but
the
bran
come
out
of
H.
,
and
Linton
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
beat
him
constantly
:
and
he
get
cross
again
,
and
cough
,
and
return
to
his
chair
.
<EOS>
that
night
,
though
,
he
easily
recover
his
good
humour
:
he
be
charm
with
two
or
three
pretty
song
 
_
your
_
song
,
Ellen
;
and
when
I
be
oblige
to
go
,
he
beg
and
entreat
me
to
come
the
following
evening
;
and
I
promise
.
<EOS>
Minny
<EOS>
and
I
go
fly
home
as
light
as
air
;
<EOS>
and
I
dreamt
of
Wuthering
Heights
and
my
sweet
,
darle
cousin
,
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
morrow
I
be
sad
;
partly
because
you
be
poorly
,
and
partly
that
I
wish
my
father
know
,
and
approve
of
my
excursion
:
but
it
be
beautiful
moonlight
after
tea
;
and
,
as
I
ride
on
,
the
gloom
clear
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
another
happy
evening
,
I
think
to
myself
;
and
what
delight
me
more
,
my
pretty
Linton
will
.
<EOS>
I
trot
up
their
garden
,
and
be
turn
round
to
the
back
,
when
that
fellow
Earnshaw
meet
me
,
take
my
bridle
,
and
bid
me
go
in
by
the
front
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
pat
Minny
's
neck
,
and
say
she
be
a
bonny
beast
,
and
appear
as
if
he
want
me
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
only
tell
him
to
leave
my
horse
alone
,
or
else
it
would
kick
him
.
<EOS>
He
answer
in
his
vulgar
accent
,
"
It
would
not
do
mitch
hurt
if
it
do
;
"
and
survey
its
leg
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
I
be
half
inclined
to
make
it
try
;
however
,
he
move
off
to
open
the
door
,
and
,
as
he
raise
the
latch
,
he
look
up
to
the
inscription
above
,
and
say
,
with
a
stupid
mixture
of
awkwardness
and
elation
:
"
<EOS>
Miss
Catherine
!
<EOS>
I
can
read
yon
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
wonderful
,
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pray
let
us
hear
you
 
<EOS>
you
_
be
_
grow
clever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
spelt
,
and
drawl
over
by
syllable
,
the
name
 
"
Hareton
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
and
the
figure
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
encouragingly
,
perceive
that
he
come
to
a
dead
halt
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
can
not
tell
them
yet
,
"
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
oh
,
you
dunce
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
laugh
heartily
at
his
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fool
stare
,
with
a
grin
hover
about
his
lip
,
and
a
scowl
gathering
over
his
eye
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
may
not
join
in
my
mirth
:
whether
it
be
not
pleasant
familiarity
,
or
what
it
really
be
,
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
settle
his
doubt
,
by
suddenly
retrieve
my
gravity
and
desire
him
to
walk
away
,
for
I
come
to
see
Linton
,
not
him
.
<EOS>
He
redden
 
I
see
that
by
the
moonlight
 
drop
his
hand
from
the
latch
,
and
skulk
off
,
a
picture
of
mortify
vanity
.
<EOS>
He
imagine
himself
to
be
as
accomplished
as
Linton
,
I
suppose
,
because
he
could
spell
his
own
name
;
and
be
marvellously
discomfited
that
I
do
not
think
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
stop
,
Miss
Catherine
,
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
interrupt
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
scold
,
but
I
do
not
like
your
conduct
there
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
remember
that
Hareton
be
your
cousin
as
much
as
Master
Heathcliff
,
you
would
have
feel
how
improper
it
be
to
behave
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
it
be
praiseworthy
ambition
for
him
to
desire
to
be
as
accomplished
as
Linton
;
and
probably
he
do
not
learn
merely
to
show
off
:
you
have
make
him
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
before
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
and
he
wish
to
remedy
it
and
please
you
.
<EOS>
to
sneer
at
his
imperfect
attempt
be
very
bad
breeding
.
<EOS>
have
you
be
bring
up
in
his
circumstance
,
would
you
be
less
rude
?
<EOS>
He
be
as
quick
and
as
intelligent
a
child
as
ever
you
be
;
and
I
be
hurt
that
he
should
be
despise
now
,
because
that
base
Heathcliff
have
treat
him
so
unjustly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Ellen
,
you
will
not
cry
about
it
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
surprised
at
my
earnestness
.
"
<EOS>
but
wait
,
and
you
shall
hear
if
he
con
his
A
b
c
to
please
me
;
and
if
it
be
worth
while
be
civil
to
the
brute
.
<EOS>
I
enter
;
Linton
be
lie
on
the
settle
,
and
half
get
up
to
welcome
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
be
ill
to
-
night
,
Catherine
,
love
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
you
must
have
all
the
talk
,
and
let
me
listen
.
<EOS>
come
,
and
sit
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
not
break
your
word
,
and
I
will
make
you
promise
again
,
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
now
that
I
must
not
tease
him
,
as
he
be
ill
;
and
I
speak
softly
and
put
no
question
,
and
avoid
irritate
him
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
bring
some
of
my
nice
book
for
him
:
he
ask
me
to
read
a
little
of
one
,
and
I
be
about
to
comply
,
when
Earnshaw
burst
the
door
open
:
have
gather
venom
with
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
advance
direct
to
us
,
seize
Linton
by
the
arm
,
and
swing
him
off
the
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
get
to
thy
own
room
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
with
passion
;
and
his
face
look
swelled
and
furious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
take
her
there
if
she

thee

Begone

<EOS>

He
swear
at
us
,
and
leave
Linton
no
time
to
answer
,
nearly
throw
him
into
the
kitchen
;
and
he
clench
his
fist
as
I
follow
,
seemingly
long
to
knock
me
down
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
for
a
moment
,
and
I
let
one
volume
fall
;
he
kick
it
after
me
,
and
shut
us
out
.
<EOS>
I
hear
a
malignant
,
crackly
laugh
by
the
fire
,
and
turn

beheld
that
odious
Joseph

rub
his
bony

he

frightful

I
take
hold
of

hand
,
and
try
to
pull
him
away
;
but
he
shriek
so
shockingly
that
I
dare
not
proceed
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
cry
be
choke
by
a
dreadful
fit
of
coughing
;
blood
gush
from
his
mouth
,
and
he
fall
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
run
into
the
yard
,
sick
with
terror
;
and
call
for
Zillah
,
as
loud
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
She
soon
hear
me
:
she
be
milk
the
cow
in
a
shed
behind
the
barn
,
and
hurry
from
her
work
,
she
inquire
what
there
be
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
breath
to
explain
;
drag
her
in
,
I
look
about
for
Linton
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
have
come
out
to
examine
the
mischief
he
have
cause
,
and
he
be
then
convey
the
poor
thing
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
Zillah
and
I
ascend
after
him
;
but
he
stop
me
at
the
top
of
the
step
,
and
say
I
should
not
go
in
:
I
must
go
home
.
<EOS>
I
exclaim
that
he
have
kill
Linton
,
and
I

would

enter
.
<EOS>
Joseph
lock
the
door
,
and
declare
I
should
do

no

stuff

ask
me
whether
I

to
be

mad

him

I
stand
cry
till
the
housekeeper
reappear
.
<EOS>
She
affirm
he
would
be
well
in
a
bit
,
but
he
could
not
do
with
that
shrieking
and
din
;
and
she
take
me
,
and
nearly
carry
me
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ellen
,
I
be
ready
to
tear
my
hair
off
my
head
!
<EOS>
I
sob
and
weep
so
that
my
eye
be
almost
blind
;
and
the
ruffian
you
have
such
sympathy
with
stand
opposite
:
presume
every
now
and
then
to
bid
me
"
wisht
,
"
and
deny
that
it
be
his
fault
;
and
,
finally
,
frighten
by
my
assertion
that
I
would
tell
papa
,
and
that
he
should
be
put
in
prison
and
hang
,
he
commence
blubber
himself
,
and
hurry
out
to
hide
his
cowardly
agitation
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
be
not
rid
of
him
:
when
at
length
they
compel
me
to
depart
,
and
I
have
get
some
hundred
yard
off
the
premise
,
he
suddenly
issue
from
the
shadow
of
the
road

side
,
and
check
Minny

take
hold
of
me

it
be
rayther
too
bad
 
<EOS>

"
I
give
him
a
cut
with
my
whip
,
think
perhaps
he
would
murder
me
.
<EOS>
He
let
go
,
thunder
one
of
his
horrid
curse
,
and
I
gallop
home
more
than
half
out
of
my
sense
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
bid
you
good
-
night
that
evening
,
and
I
do
not
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
the
next
:
<EOS>
I
wish
to
go
exceedingly
;
but
I
be
strangely
excited
,
and
dread
to
hear
that
Linton
be
dead
,
sometimes
;
and
sometimes
shudder
at
the
thought
of
encounter
Hareton
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
I
take
courage
:
at
least
,
I
could
not
bear
long
suspense
,
and
steal
off
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
go
at
five
o'clock
,
and
walk
;
fancy
I
may
manage
to
creep
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
Linton
's
room
,
unobserved
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
dog
give
notice
of
my
approach
.
<EOS>
Zillah
receive
me
,
and
say
"
the
lad
be
mend
nicely
,
"
show
me
into
a
small
,
tidy
,
carpet
apartment
,
where
,
to
my
inexpressible
joy
,
I
beheld
Linton
lay
on
a
little
sofa
,
read
one
of
my
book
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
neither
speak
to
me
nor
look
at
me
,
through
a
whole
hour
,
Ellen
<EOS>
:
he
have
such
an
unhappy
temper
.
<EOS>
and
what
quite
confound
me
,
when
he
do
open
his
mouth
,
it
be
to
utter
the
falsehood
that
I
have
occasion
the
uproar
,
and
Hareton
be
not
to
blame
!
<EOS>
unable
to
reply
,
except
passionately
,
I
get
up
and
walk
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
send
after
me
a
faint
"
Catherine
!
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
reckon
on
be
answer
so
:
but
I
would
not
turn
back
;
and
the
morrow
be
the
second
day
on
which
I
stay
at
home
,
nearly
determine
to
visit
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
miserable
go
to
bed
and
get
up
,
and
never
hear
anything
about
him
,
that
my
resolution
melt
into
air
before
it
be
properly
form
.
<EOS>
It
have
appear
wrong
to
take
the
journey
once
;
now
it
seem
wrong
to
refrain
.
<EOS>
Michael
come
to
ask
if
he
must
saddle
Minny
;
I
say
"
yes
,
"
and
consider
myself
do
a
duty
as
she
bear
me
over
the
hill
.
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
pass
the
front
window
to
get
to
the
court

it
be
no
use

to
conceal
my
presence

for

in

there
also

room
directly

in

great

asleep

up

fire

serious
tone

it
to
be
true

as
you
do
not
like
me

Linton

and
as
you
think

come
on
purpose
to
hurt
you

and
pretend
that
I
do
so
<EOS>
every
time
,
this
be
our
last
meeting

let
us
say
good

bye
;
and
tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
that
you
have
no
wish

see
me

must
not

any
more
falsehood
on

subject

down

your
hat
off

"
You
be
so
much
happy
than
I
be
,
you
ought
to
be
well

<EOS>
papa
talk
enough
of
my
defect
,
and
show
enough
scorn
of
me
,
to
make
it
natural
I
should
doubt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
I
be
not
altogether
as
worthless
as
he
call
me
,
frequently
;
and
then
I
feel
so
cross
and
bitter
,
I
hate
everybody
!
<EOS>
I
be
worthless
,
and
bad
in
temper
,
and
bad
in
spirit
,
almost
always
;
and
,
if
you
choose
,
you
may
say
<EOS>
good
-
bye
<EOS>
:
you
will
get
rid
of
an
annoyance
.
<EOS>
only
,
Catherine
,
do
me
this
justice
:
believe
that
if
I
may
be
as
sweet
,
and
as
kind
,
and
as
good
as
you
be
,
I
would
be
;
as
willingly
,
and
more
so
,
than
as
happy
and
as
healthy
.
<EOS>
and
believe
that
your
kindness
have
make
me
love
you
deeper
than
if
I
deserve
your
love
:
and
though
I
could
not
,
and
can
not
help
show
my
nature
to
you
,
I
regret
it
and
repent
it
;
and
shall
regret
and
repent
it
till
I
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
he
speak
the
truth
;
and
I
feel
I
must
forgive
him
:
and
,
though
we
should
quarrel
the
next
moment
,
I
must
forgive
him
again
.
<EOS>
We
be
reconcile
;
but
we
cry
,
both
of
us
,
the
whole
time
I
stay
:
not
entirely
for
sorrow
;
yet
I
_
be
_
<EOS>
sorry
Linton
have
that
distort
nature
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
let
his
friend
be
at
ease
,
and
he
will
never
be
at
ease
himself
!
<EOS>
I
have
always
go
to
his
little
parlour
,
since
that
night
;
because
his
father
return
the
day
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
three
time
,
I
think
,
we
have
be
merry
and
hopeful
,
as
we
be
the
first
evening
;
the
rest
of
my
visit
be
dreary
and
troubled
:
now
with
his
selfishness
and
spite
,
and
now
with
his
suffering
:
but
I
have
learn
to
endure
the
former
with
nearly
as
little
resentment
as
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
purposely
avoid
me
:
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
see
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
last
Sunday
,
indeed
,
come
earlier
than
usual
,
I
hear
him
abuse
poor
Linton
cruelly
for
his
conduct
of
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
how
he
know
of
it
,
unless
he
listen
.
<EOS>
Linton
have
certainly
behave
provokingly
:
however
,
it
be
the
business
of
nobody
but
me
,
and
I
interrupt
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
lecture
by
enter
and
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
He
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
go
away
,
say
he
be
glad
I
take
that
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
since
then
,
I
have
tell
Linton
he
must
whisper
his
bitter
thing
.
<EOS>
now
,
Ellen
,
you
have
hear
all
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
prevent
from
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
except
by
inflict
misery
on
two
people
;
whereas
,
if
you
will
only
not
tell
papa
,
my
go
need
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
none
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
tell
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
heartless
,
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
will
make
up
my
mind
on
that
point
by
to

morrow

Miss
Catherine
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
require
some
study
;
and
so
I
will
leave
you
to
your
rest
,
and
go
think
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
over
aloud
,
in
my
master
's
presence
;
walk
straight
from
her
room
to
his
,
and
relate
the
whole
story
:
with
the
exception
of
her
conversation
with
her
cousin
,
and
any
mention
of
Hareton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Linton
be
alarm
and
distressed
,
more
than
he
would
acknowledge
to
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
Catherine
learn
my
betrayal
of
her
confidence
,
and
she
learn
also
that
her
secret
visit
be
to
end
.
<EOS>
in
vain
she
weep
and
writhe
against
the
interdict
,
and
implore
her
father
to
have
pity
on
Linton
:
all
she
get
to
comfort
her
be
a
promise
that
he
would
write
and
give
him
leave
to
come
to
the
grange
when
he
please
;
but
explain
that
he
must
no
longer
expect
to
see
Catherine
at
Wuthering
Heights
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
have
he
be
aware
of
his
nephew
's
disposition
and
state
of
health
,
he
would
have
see
fit
to
withhold
even
that
slight
consolation
.
    
<EOS>
"
these
thing
happen
last
winter
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Dean
;
"
hardly
more
than
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
last
winter
,
I
do
not
think
,
at
another
twelve
month
'
end
,
I
should
be
amuse
a
stranger
to
the
family
with
relate
them
!
<EOS>
yet
,
who
know
how
long
you
will
be
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
You
be
too
young
to
rest
always
contented
,
live
by
yourself
;
and
I
some
way
fancy
no
one
could
see
Catherine
Linton
and
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
You
smile
;
but
why
do
you
look
so
lively
and
interested
when
I
talk
about
her
?
<EOS>
and
why
have
you
ask
me
to
hang
her
picture
over
your
fireplace
?
<EOS>
and
why
 
?
"
  
"
stop
,
my
good
friend
!
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
very
possible
that
_
I
_
should
love
her
;
but
would
she
love
me
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
too
much
to
venture
my
tranquillity
by
run
into
temptation
:
and
then
my
home
be
not
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
of
the
busy
world
,
and
to
its
arm
I
must
return
.
<EOS>
go
on
.
<EOS>
be
catherine
obedient
to
her
father
's
command
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
,
"
continue
the
housekeeper
.
"
<EOS>
Her
affection
for
him
be
still
the
chief
sentiment
in
her
heart
;
and
he
speak
without
anger
:
he
speak
in
the
deep
tenderness
of
one
about
to
leave
his
treasure
amid
peril
and
foe
,
where
his
remembered
word
would
be
the
only
aid
that
he
could
bequeath
to
guide
her
.
<EOS>
He
say
to
me
,
a
few
day
afterwards
,
"
I
wish
my
nephew
would
write
,
Ellen
,
or
call
.
<EOS>
tell
me
,
sincerely
,
what
you
think
of
him
:
be
he
change
for
the
well
,
or
be
there
a
prospect
of
improvement
,
as
he
grow
a
man
?
"
  
"
"
He
be
very
delicate
,
sir
,
"
I
reply
;
"
and
scarcely
likely
to
reach
manhood
:
but
this
I
can
say
,
he
do
not
resemble
his
father
;
and
if
Miss
Catherine
have
the
misfortune
to
marry
him
,
he
would
not
be
beyond
her
control
:
unless
she
be
extremely
and
foolishly
indulgent
.
<EOS>
however
,
master
,
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
acquaint
with
him
and
see
whether
he
would
suit
her
:
it
want
four
year
and
more
to
his
being
of
age
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Edgar
sigh
;
and
,
walk
to
the
window
,
look
out
towards
Gimmerton
Kirk
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
misty
afternoon
,
but
the
February
sun
shine
dimly
,
and
we
could
just
distinguish
the
two
fir
-
tree
in
the
yard
,
and
the
sparely
-
scatter
gravestone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
pray
often
,
"
he
half
soliloquised
,
"
for
the
approach
of
what
be
come
;
and
now
I
begin
to
shrink
,
and
fear
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
memory
of
the
hour
<EOS>
I
come
down
that
glen
<EOS>
a
bridegroom
would
be
less
sweet
than
the
anticipation
that
I
be
soon
,
in
a
few
month
,
or
,
possibly
,
week
,
to
be
carry
up
,
and
lay
in
its
lonely
hollow
!
<EOS>
Ellen
,
I
have
be
very
happy
with
my
little
Cathy
:
through
winter
night
and
summer
day
she
be
a
live
hope
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
as
happy
musing
by
myself
among
those
stone
,
under
that
old
church
:
lying
,
through
the
long
June
evening
,
on
the
green
mound
of
her
mother
's
grave
,
and
wish
 
yearning
for
the
time
when
I
may
lie
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
for
Cathy
?
<EOS>
how
must
I
quit
her
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
care
one
moment
for
Linton
be
Heathcliff
's
son
;
nor
for
his
take
her
from
me
,
if
he
could
console
her
for
my
loss
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
care
that
Heathcliff
gain
his
end
,
and
triumph
in
rob
me
of
my
last
blessing
!
<EOS>
but
should
Linton
be
unworthy
 
only
a
feeble
tool
to
his
father
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
abandon
her
to
him
!
<EOS>
and
,
hard
though
it
be
to
crush
her
buoyant
spirit
,
I
must
persevere
in
make
her
sad
while
I
live
,
and
leave
her
solitary
when
I
die
.
<EOS>
darling
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
resign
her
to
God
,
and
lie
her
in
the
earth
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
resign
her
to
God
as
it
be
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
I
answer
,
"
and
<EOS>
if
we
should
lose
you
 
which
may
He
forbid
 
under
His
providence
<EOS>
,
I
will
stand
her
friend
and
counsellor
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Miss
Catherine
be
a
good
girl
:
I
do
not
fear
that
she
will
go
wilfully
wrong
;
and
people
who
do
their
duty
be
always
finally
reward
.
"
  
<EOS>
spring
advance
;
yet
my
master
gather
no
real
strength
,
though
he
resume
his
walk
in
the
ground
with
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
to
her
inexperienced
notion
,
this
itself
be
a
sign
of
convalescence
;
and
then
his
cheek
be
often
flush
,
and
his
eye
be
bright
;
she
feel
sure
of
his
recovering
.
<EOS>
on
her
seventeenth
birthday
,
he
do
not
visit
the
churchyard
:
it
be
rain
,
and
I
observe
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
surely
not
go
out
to
-
night
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
answer
,
 
"
no
,
I
will
defer
it
this
year
a
little
longer
.
"
<EOS>
He
write
again
to
Linton
,
express
his
great
desire
to
see
him
;
and
,
have
the
invalid
be
presentable
,
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
his
father
would
have
permit
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
be
instruct
,
he
return
an
answer
,
intimate
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
object
to
his
calling
at
the
grange
;
but
his
uncle
's
kind
remembrance
delight
him
,
and
he
hope
to
meet
him
sometimes
in
his
ramble
,
and
personally
to
petition
that
his
cousin
and
he
may
not
remain
long
so
utterly
divide
.
  
<EOS>
that
part
of
his
letter
be
simple
,
and
probably
his
own
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
know
he
could
plead
eloquently
for
Catherine
's
company
,
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
she
may
visit
here
;
but
be
I
never
to
see
her
,
because
my
father
forbid
me
to
go
to
her
home
,
and
you
forbid
her
to
come
to
mine
?
<EOS>
do
,
now
and
then
,
ride
with
her
towards
the
Heights
;
and
let
us
exchange
a
few
word
,
in
your
presence
!
<EOS>
We
have
do
nothing
to
deserve
this
separation
;
and
you
be
not
angry
with
me
:
you
have
no
reason
to
dislike
me
,
you
allow
,
yourself
.
<EOS>
dear
uncle
!
<EOS>
send
me
a
kind
note
to
-
morrow
,
and
leave
to
join
you
anywhere
you
please
,
except
at
Thrushcross
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
believe
an
interview
would
convince
you
that
my
father
's
character
be
not
mine
:
he
affirm
I
be
more
your
nephew
than
his
son
;
and
though
I
have
fault
which
render
me
unworthy
of
Catherine
,
she
have
excuse
them
,
and
for
her
sake
,
you
should
also
.
<EOS>
You
inquire
after
my
health
 
<EOS>
it
be
well
;
but
while
I
remain
cut
off
from
all
hope
,
and
doom
to
solitude
,
or
the
society
of
those
who
never
do
and
never
will
like
me
,
how
can
I
be
cheerful
and
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edgar
,
though
he
feel
for
the
boy
,
could
not
consent
to
grant
his
request
;
because
he
could
not
accompany
Catherine
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
in
summer
,
perhaps
,
they
may
meet
:
meantime
,
he
wish
him
to
continue
write
at
interval
,
and
engage
to
give
him
what
advice
and
comfort
<EOS>
he
be
able
by
letter
;
be
well
aware
of
his
hard
position
in
his
family
.
<EOS>
Linton
comply
;
and
have
he
be
unrestrained
,
would
probably
have
spoil
all
by
fill
his
epistle
with
complaint
and
lamentation
:
but
his
father
keep
a
sharp
watch
over
him
;
and
,
of
course
,
insist
on
every
line
that
my
master
send
be
show
;
so
,
instead
of
pen
his
peculiar
personal
suffering
and
distress
,
the
theme
constantly
uppermost
in
his
thought
,
he
harp
on
the
cruel
obligation
of
be
hold
asunder
from
his
friend
and
love
;
and
gently
intimate
that
Mr.
Linton
must
allow
an
interview
soon
,
or
he
should
fear
he
be
purposely
deceive
him
with
empty
promise
.
  
<EOS>
Cathy
be
a
powerful
ally
at
home
;
and
between
them
they
at
length
persuade
my
master
to
acquiesce
in
their
have
a
ride
or
a
walk
together
about
once
a
week
,
under
my
guardianship
,
and
on
the
moor
nearest
the
grange
:
for
June
find
him
still
decline
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
set
aside
yearly
a
portion
of
his
income
for
my
young
lady
's
fortune
,
he
have
a
natural
desire
that
she
may
retain
 
or
at
least
return
in
a
short
time
to
 
the
house
of
her
ancestor
;
and
he
consider
her
only
prospect
of
do
that
be
by
a
union
with
his
heir
;
he
have
no
idea
that
the
latter
be
fail
almost
as
fast
as
himself
;
nor
have
any
one
,
I
believe
:
no
doctor
visit
the
Heights
,
and
no
one
see
Master
Heathcliff
to
make
report
of
his
condition
among
us
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
begin
to
fancy
my
foreboding
be
false
,
and
that
he
must
be
actually
rally
,
when
he
mention
ride
and
walk
on
the
moor
,
and
seem
so
earnest
in
pursue
his
object
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
picture
a
father
treat
a
die
child
as
tyrannically
and
wickedly
as
I
afterwards
learn
Heathcliff
have
treat
him
,
to
compel
this
apparent
eagerness
:
his
effort
redouble
the
more
imminently
his
avaricious
and
unfeeling
plan
be
threaten
with
defeat
by
death
.
    
<EOS>
Summer
be
already
past
its
prime
,
when
Edgar
reluctantly
yield
his
assent
to
their
entreaty
,
and
Catherine
and
I
set
out
on
our
first
ride
to
join
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
close
,
sultry
day
:
devoid
of
sunshine
,
but
with
a
sky
too
dappled
and
hazy
to
threaten
rain
:
and
our
place
of
meeting
have
be
fix
at
the
guide
-
stone
,
by
the
cross
-
road
.
<EOS>
on
arrive
there
,
however
,
a
little
herd
-
boy
,
despatch
as
a
messenger
,
tell
us
that
,
 
"
Maister
Linton
wer
just
o
<EOS>
'
this
side
th
'
 
Heights
:
and
he
would
be
mitch
obleeged
to
us
to
gang
on
a
bit
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
Master
Linton
have
forget
the
first
injunction
of
his
uncle
,
"
<EOS>
I
observe
:
"
he
bid
us
keep
on
the
Grange
land
,
and
here
we
be
off
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
will
turn
our
horse
'
head
round
when
we
reach
him
,
"
answer
my
companion
;
"
our
excursion
shall
lie
towards
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
when
we
reach
him
,
and
that
be
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
his
own
door
,
we
find
he
have
no
horse
;
and
we
be
force
to
dismount
,
and
leave
our
to
graze
.
<EOS>
He
lie
on
the
heath
,
await
our
approach
,
and
do
not
rise
till
we
come
within
a
few
yard
.
<EOS>
then
he
walk
so
feebly
,
and
look
so
pale
,
that
I
immediately
exclaim
,
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Master
Heathcliff
,
you
be
not
fit
for
enjoy
a
ramble
this
morning
.
<EOS>
how
ill
you
do
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
survey
him
with
grief
and
astonishment
:
she
change
the
ejaculation
of
joy
on
her
lip
to
one
of
alarm
;
and
the
congratulation
on
their
long
-
postpone
meeting
to
an
anxious
inquiry
,
whether
he
be
bad
than
usual
?
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
 
better
 
better
!
"
<EOS>
he
pant
,
tremble
,
and
retain
her
hand
as
if
he
need
its
support
,
while
his
large
blue
eye
wander
timidly
over
her
;
the
hollowness
round
them
transform
to
haggard
wildness
the
languid
expression
they
once
possess
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
be
bad
,
"
persist
his
cousin
;
"
bad
than
when
I
see
you
last
;
you
be
thin
,
and
 
"
  
"
I
be
tired
,
"
he
interrupt
,
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
hot
for
walk
,
let
us
rest
here
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
the
morning
,
I
often
feel
sick
 
<EOS>
papa
say
I
grow
so
fast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
badly
satisfied
,
Cathy
sit
down
,
and
he
recline
beside
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
something
like
your
paradise
,
"
say
she
,
make
an
effort
at
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
the
two
day
we
agree
to
spend
in
the
place
and
way
each
thought
pleasantest
?
<EOS>
this
be
nearly
your
,
only
there
be
cloud
;
but
then
they
be
so
soft
and
mellow
:
it
be
nice
than
sunshine
.
<EOS>
next
week
,
if
you
can
,
we
will
ride
down
to
the
Grange
Park
,
and
try
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
do
not
appear
to
remember
what
she
talk
of
<EOS>
and
he
have
evidently
great
difficulty
in
sustain
any
kind
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
His
lack
of
interest
in
the
subject
she
start
,
and
his
equal
incapacity
to
contribute
to
her
entertainment
,
be
so
obvious
that
she
could
not
conceal
her
disappointment
.
<EOS>
an
indefinite
alteration
have
come
over
his
whole
person
and
manner
.
<EOS>
the
pettishness
that
may
be
caress
into
fondness
,
have
yield
to
a
listless
apathy
;
there
be
less
of
the
peevish
temper
of
a
child
which
fret
and
tease
on
purpose
to
be
soothe
,
and
more
of
the
self
-
absorb
moroseness
of
a
confirm
invalid
,
repelling
consolation
,
and
ready
to
regard
the
good
-
humour
mirth
of
other
as
an
insult
.
<EOS>
Catherine
perceive
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
he
hold
it
rather
a
punishment
,
than
a
gratification
,
to
endure
our
company
;
and
she
make
no
scruple
of
proposing
,
presently
,
to
depart
.
<EOS>
that
proposal
,
unexpectedly
,
rouse
Linton
from
his
lethargy
,
and
throw
him
into
a
strange
state
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
He
glance
fearfully
towards
the
Heights
,
beg
she
would
remain
another
half
-
hour
,
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
,
"
say
Cathy
,
"
you
would
be
more
comfortable
at
home
than
sit
here
;
and
I
can
not
amuse
you
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
by
my
tale
,
and
song
,
and
chatter
:
you
have
grow
wise
than
I
,
in
these
six
month
;
you
have
little
taste
for
my
diversion
now
:
or
else
,
if
I
could
amuse
you
,
I
would
willingly
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stay
to
rest
yourself
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
,
Catherine
,
do
not
think
or
say
that
I
be
_
<EOS>
very
_
<EOS>
unwell
<EOS>
:
it
be
the
heavy
weather
and
heat
that
make
me
dull
;
and
I
walk
about
,
before
you
come
,
a
great
deal
for
me
.
<EOS>
tell
uncle
<EOS>
I
be
in
tolerable
health
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
him
that
_
you
_
say
so
,
Linton
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
affirm
that
you
be
,
"
observe
my
young
lady
,
wonder
at
his
pertinacious
assertion
of
what
be
evidently
an
untruth
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
here
again
next
Thursday
,
"
continue
he
,
shun
her
puzzled
gaze
.
"
<EOS>
and
give
him
my
thank
for
permit
you
to
come
 
my
good
thank
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
and
 
and
,
if
you
_
do
_
meet
my
father
,
and
he
ask
you
about
me
,
do
not
lead
him
to
suppose
that
I
have
be
extremely
silent
and
stupid
:
do
not
look
sad
and
downcast
,
as
you
be
do
 
he
will
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
care
nothing
for
his
anger
,
"
exclaim
Cathy
,
imagine
she
would
be
its
object
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
,
"
say
her
cousin
,
shuddering
.
"
<EOS>
_
do
not
_
provoke
him
against
me
,
Catherine
,
for
he
be
very
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
severe
to
you
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
"
<EOS>
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
he
grow
weary
of
indulgence
,
and
pass
from
passive
to
active
hatred
?
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
look
at
me
,
but
do
not
answer
;
and
,
after
keep
her
seat
by
his
side
another
ten
minute
,
during
which
his
head
fall
drowsily
on
his
breast
,
and
he
utter
nothing
except
suppressed
moan
of
exhaustion
or
pain
,
Cathy
begin
to
seek
solace
in
look
for
bilberry
,
and
share
the
produce
of
her
research
with
me
:
she
do
not
offer
them
to
him
,
for
she
see
further
notice
would
only
weary
and
annoy
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
half
-
an
-
hour
now
,
Ellen
?
"
<EOS>
she
whisper
in
my
ear
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
why
we
should
stay
.
<EOS>
He
be
asleep
,
and
papa
will
be
want
us
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
must
not
leave
him
asleep
,
"
I
answer
;
"
wait
till
he
wake
,
and
be
patient
.
<EOS>
You
be
mighty
eager
to
set
off
,
but
your
longing
to
see
poor
Linton
have
soon
evaporate
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
_
he
_
wish
to
see
me
?
"
return
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
his
cross
humour
,
formerly
,
I
like
him
better
than
I
do
in
his
present
curious
mood
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
if
it
be
a
task
he
be
compel
to
perform
 
this
interview
 
for
fear
his
father
should
scold
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
hardly
go
to
come
to
give
Mr.
Heathcliff
pleasure
;
whatever
reason
he
may
have
for
order
Linton
to
undergo
this
penance
.
<EOS>
and
,
though
I
be
glad
he
be
well
in
health
,
I
be
sorry
he
be
so
much
less
pleasant
,
and
so
much
less
affectionate
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
_
<EOS>
he
be
_
better
in
health
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
answer
;
"
because
he
always
make
such
a
great
deal
of
his
suffering
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
tolerably
well
,
as
he
tell
me
to
tell
papa
;
but
he
be
well
,
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
you
differ
with
me
,
Miss
Cathy
,
"
I
remark
;
"
I
should
conjecture
him
to
be
far
bad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
here
start
from
his
slumber
in
bewildered
terror
,
and
ask
if
any
one
have
call
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Catherine
;
"
unless
in
dream
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
how
you
manage
to
doze
out
of
door
,
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
hear
my
father
,
"
he
gasp
,
glance
up
to
the
frown
nab
above
us
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
nobody
speak
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
,
"
reply
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
Ellen
and
I
be
dispute
concern
your
health
.
<EOS>
be
you
truly
strong
,
Linton
,
than
when
we
separate
in
winter
?
<EOS>
if
you
be
,
I
be
certain
one
thing
be
not
strong
 
<EOS>
your
regard
for
me
<EOS>
:
speak
,
 
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
tear
gush
from
Linton
's
eye
as
he
answer
,
"
yes
,
yes
,
I
be
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
still
under
the
spell
of
the
imaginary
voice
,
his
gaze
wander
up
and
down
to
detect
its
owner
.
  
<EOS>
Cathy
rise
.
<EOS>
"
for
to
-
day
we
must
part
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
not
conceal
that
I
have
be
sadly
disappointed
with
our
meeting
;
though
I
will
mention
it
to
nobody
<EOS>
but
you
:
<EOS>
not
that
I
stand
in
awe
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
hush
,
"
murmur
Linton
;
"
for
God
's
sake
,
hush
!
<EOS>
He
be
come
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
cling
to
Catherine
's
arm
,
strive
to
detain
her
;
but
at
that
announcement
she
hastily
disengage
herself
,
and
whistle
to
Minny
,
who
obey
her
like
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
here
next
Thursday
,
"
she
cry
,
spring
to
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
quick
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
we
leave
him
,
scarcely
conscious
of
our
departure
,
<EOS>
so
absorb
be
he
in
anticipate
his
father
's
approach
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
reach
home
,
Catherine
's
displeasure
soften
into
a
perplex
sensation
of
pity
and
regret
,
largely
blend
with
vague
,
uneasy
doubt
about
Linton
's
actual
circumstance
,
physical
and
social
:
in
which
I
partook
,
though
I
counsel
her
not
to
say
much
;
for
a
second
journey
would
make
us
well
judge
.
<EOS>
My
master
request
an
account
of
our
ongoing
.
<EOS>
His
nephew
's
offering
of
thank
be
duly
deliver
,
Miss
Cathy
gently
touch
on
the
rest
:
I
also
throw
little
light
on
his
inquiry
,
for
I
hardly
know
what
to
hide
and
what
to
reveal
.
    
<EOS>
seven
day
glide
away
,
every
one
mark
its
course
by
the
henceforth
rapid
alteration
of
Edgar
Linton
's
state
.
<EOS>
the
havoc
that
month
have
previously
work
be
now
emulate
by
the
inroad
of
hour
.
<EOS>
Catherine
we
would
fain
have
delude
yet
;
but
her
own
quick
spirit
refuse
to
delude
her
:
it
divine
in
secret
,
and
brood
on
the
dreadful
probability
,
gradually
ripen
into
certainty
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
the
heart
to
mention
her
ride
,
when
Thursday
come
round
;
I
mention
it
for
her
,
and
obtain
permission
to
order
her
out
of
door
:
for
the
library
,
where
her
father
stop
a
short
time
daily
 
<EOS>
the
brief
period
he
could
bear
to
sit
up
 
and
his
chamber
,
have
become
her
whole
world
.
<EOS>
She
grudge
each
moment
that
do
not
find
her
bend
over
his
pillow
,
or
seat
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
grow
wan
with
watching
and
sorrow
,
and
my
master
gladly
dismiss
her
to
what
he
flatter
himself
would
be
a
happy
change
of
scene
and
society
;
draw
comfort
from
the
hope
that
she
would
not
now
be
leave
entirely
alone
after
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
fix
idea
<EOS>
,
I
guess
by
several
observation
he
let
fall
,
that
,
as
his
nephew
resemble
him
in
person
,
he
would
resemble
him
in
mind
;
for
Linton
's
letter
bear
few
or
no
indication
of
his
defective
character
.
<EOS>
and
I
,
through
pardonable
weakness
,
refrain
from
correct
the
error
;
ask
myself
what
good
there
would
be
in
disturb
his
last
moment
with
information
that
he
have
neither
power
nor
opportunity
to
turn
to
account
.
  
<EOS>
We
defer
our
excursion
till
the
afternoon
;
a
golden
afternoon
of
August
:
every
breath
from
the
hill
so
full
of
life
,
that
it
seem
whoever
respire
it
,
though
die
,
may
revive
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
face
be
just
like
the
landscape
 
shadow
and
sunshine
flit
over
it
in
rapid
succession
;
but
the
shadow
rest
longer
,
and
the
sunshine
be
more
transient
;
and
her
poor
little
heart
reproach
itself
for
even
that
pass
forgetfulness
of
its
care
.
  
<EOS>
We
discern
Linton
watch
at
the
same
spot
he
have
select
before
.
<EOS>
My
young
mistress
alight
,
and
tell
me
that
,
as
she
be
resolve
to
stay
a
very
little
while
,
I
have
better
hold
the
pony
and
remain
on
horseback
;
but
I
dissent
:
I
would
not
risk
lose
sight
of
the
charge
committed
to
me
a
minute
;
so
we
climb
the
slope
of
heath
together
.
<EOS>
Master
Heathcliff
receive
us
with
great
animation
on
this
occasion
:
not
the
animation
of
high
spirit
though
,
nor
yet
of
joy
;
it
look
more
like
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
late
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
speak
short
and
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
be
not
your
father
very
ill
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
not
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
why
_
will
not
you
be
candid
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Catherine
,
swallow
her
greeting
.
<EOS>
"
why
can
not
you
say
at
once
you
do
not
want
me
?
<EOS>
It
be
strange
,
Linton
,
that
for
the
second
time
you
have
bring
me
here
on
purpose
,
apparently
to
distress
us
both
,
and
for
no
reason
besides
!
"
  
<EOS>
Linton
shiver
,
and
glance
at
her
,
half
supplicating
,
half
ashamed
;
but
his
cousin
's
patience
be
not
sufficient
to
endure
this
enigmatical
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
_
be
_
very
ill
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
why
be
I
call
from
his
bedside
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
send
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
,
when
you
wish
I
would
not
keep
it
?
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
I
desire
an
explanation
:
<EOS>
playing
and
trifling
be
completely
banish
out
of
my
mind
;
and
I
can
not
dance
attendance
on
your
affectation
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
affectation
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmur
;
"
what
be
they
?
<EOS>
for
heaven
's
sake
,
Catherine
,
do
not
look
so
angry
!
<EOS>
despise
me
as
much
as
you
please
;
I
be
a
worthless
,
cowardly
wretch
:
I
can
not
be
scorn
enough
;
but
I
be
too
mean
for
your
anger
.
<EOS>
hate
my
father
,
and
spare
me
for
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!

cry
Catherine
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
foolish
,
silly
boy
!
<EOS>
and
there
!
<EOS>
he
tremble
:
as
if
I
be
really
go
to
touch
him
!
<EOS>
You
need
not
bespeak
contempt
,
Linton
:
anybody
will
have
it
spontaneously
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
get
off
!
<EOS>
I
shall
return
home
:
it
be
folly
drag
you
from
the
hearth
-
stone
,
and
pretend
 
what
do
we
pretend
?
<EOS>
let
go
my
frock
!
<EOS>
if
I
pity
you
for
cry
and
look
so
very
frightened
,
you
should
spurn
such
pity
.
<EOS>
Ellen
,
tell
him
how
disgraceful
this
conduct
be
.
<EOS>
rise
,
and
do
not
degrade
yourself
into
an
abject
reptile
 
<EOS>
_
do
not

!
"
  
<EOS>
with
stream
face
and
an
expression
of
agony
,
Linton
have
throw
his
nerveless
frame
along
the
ground
:
he
seem
convulsed
with
exquisite
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

he
sob
,

I
can
not

it

Catherine

too

be
kill

_
Dear

my

you
have
say

you

<EOS>
You
will
not
go

then

<EOS>
kind

sweet

good
Catherine

<EOS>
and
perhaps
you

consent
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
My

intense
anguish

stoop
to

talk
,
and
I
will
.
<EOS>
You
contradict
your
own
word
,
and
distract
me
!
<EOS>
be
calm
and
frank
,
and
confess
at
once
all
that
weigh
on
your
heart
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
injure
me
,
Linton
,
would
you
?
<EOS>
You
would
not
let
any
enemy
hurt
me
,
if
you
could
prevent
it
?
<EOS>
I
will
believe
you
be
a
coward
,
for
yourself
,
but
not
a
cowardly
betrayer
of
your
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
my
father
threaten
me
,
"
gasp
the
boy
,
clasp
his
attenuated
finger
,
"
and
I
dread
him
 
<EOS>
I
dread
him
!
<EOS>
I
_
dare
_
not
tell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
!
"
say
Catherine
,
with
scornful
compassion
,
"
keep
your
secret
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
be
_
no
coward
.
<EOS>
save
yourself
:
<EOS>
I
be
not
afraid
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
magnanimity
provoke
his
tear
:
he
weep
wildly
,
kiss
her
support
hand
,
and
yet
could
not
summon
courage
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
cogitate
what
the
mystery
may
be
,
and
determine
Catherine
should
never
suffer
to
benefit
him
or
any
one
else
,
by
my
good
will
;
when
,
hear
a
rustle
among
the
ling
,
I
look
up
and
see
Mr.
Heathcliff
almost
close
upon
us
,
descend
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
cast
a
glance
towards
my
companion
,
though
they
be
sufficiently
near
for
Linton
's
sobs
to
be
audible
;
but
hail
me
in
the
almost
hearty
tone
he
assume
to
none
besides
,
and
the
sincerity
of
which
I
could
not
avoid
doubt
,
he
say
    
"
It
be
something
to
see
you
so
near
to
my
house
,
nelly
.
<EOS>
how
be
you
at
the
grange
?
<EOS>
let
us
hear
.
<EOS>
the
rumour
go
,
"
he
add
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
that
Edgar
Linton
be
on
his
death
-
bed
:
perhaps
they
exaggerate
his
illness
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
my
master
be
die
,
"
<EOS>
I
reply
:
"
it
be
true
enough
.
<EOS>
a
sad
thing
it
will
be
for
us
all
,
but
a
blessing
for
him
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
will
he
last
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
he
continue
,
look
at
the
two
young
people
,
who
be
fix
under
his
eye
 
<EOS>
Linton
appear
as
if
he
could
not
venture
to
stir
or
raise
his
head
,
and
Catherine
could
not
move
,
on
his
account
 
"
because
that
lad
yonder
seem
determined
to
beat
me
;
and
I
would
thank
his
uncle
to
be
quick
,
and
go
before
him
!
<EOS>
hallo
!
<EOS>
have
the
whelp
be
play
that
game
long
?
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
do

give
him
some
lesson
about
snivel
.
<EOS>
be
he
pretty
lively
with
Miss
Linton
generally
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
lively
?
<EOS>
no
 
he
have
show
the
great
distress
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
to
see
him
,
I
should
say
,
that
instead
of
ramble
with
his
sweetheart
on
the
hill
,
he
ought
to
be
in
bed
,
under
the
hand
of
a
doctor

<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
,
in

Heathcliff

first
 
get
up
,
Linton

<EOS>
get
up

<EOS>
"
do
not

this
moment

"
  
<EOS>
Linton
have
sink
prostrate
again
in
another
paroxysm
of
helpless
fear
,
cause
by
his
father
's
glance
towards
him
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
:
there
be
nothing
else
to
produce
such
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
make
several
effort
to
obey
,
but
his
little
strength
be
annihilate
for
the
time
,
and
he
fall
back
again
with
a
moan
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
advance
,
and
lift
him
to
lean
against
a
ridge
of
turf
.
  
<EOS>
"
now

say
he
,
with
curbed
ferocity
,

<EOS>
"
You
be
very
stiff

say
Heathcliff
,

I
know
that

you

force
me

pinch
the
baby

come

my

<EOS>
He
approach
once
more
,
and
make
as
if
he
would
seize
the
fragile
being
;
but
,
shrink
back
,
Linton
cling
to
his
cousin
,
and
implore
her
to
accompany
him
,
with
a
frantic
importunity
that
admit
no
denial
.
<EOS>
however
I
disapprove
,
I
could
not
hinder
her
:
indeed
,
how
could
she
have
refuse
him
herself
?
<EOS>
what
be
fill
him
with
dread
<EOS>
we
have
no
means
of
discerning
;

there
he
be
,
powerless
under
its
gripe
,
and
any
addition
seem
capable
of
shock
him
into
idiotcy
.
<EOS>
We
reach
the
threshold
;
Catherine
walk
in
,
and
I
stand
wait
till
she
have
conduct
the
invalid
to
a
chair
,
expect
her
out
immediately
;
when
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
push
me
forward
,
exclaim
 
"
My

not
stricken

plague

I

a

down

He
shut

lock
it
also

You
shall
have

cattle
to

off

you
what

nothing

It

odd
what
a

feeling

bear
where

amusement

<EOS>
He
draw
in
his
breath
,
strike
the
table
,
and
swear
to
himself
,
"
by
hell
!
<EOS>
I
hate
them

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

exclaim
Catherine

who
could
not

the
latter
part

his
speech

<EOS>
She
step
close
up
;
her
black
eye
flash
with
passion

resolution

"
<EOS>
give
me
that
key

it

I

<EOS>
Heathcliff
have
the
key
in
his
hand
that
remain
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
,
seize
with
a
sort
of
surprise
at
her
boldness
;
or
,
possibly
,
remind
,
by
her
voice
and
glance
,
of
the
person
from
whom
she
inherit
it
.
<EOS>
She
snatch
at
the
instrument
,
and
half
succeed
in
get
it
out
of
his
loosened
finger
:
but
her
action
recall
him
to
the
present
;
he
recover
it
speedily
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Catherine
Linton
,
"
he
say
,
"
stand
off
,
or
I
shall
knock
you
down
;

that
will
make
Mrs.
Dean
mad

"
  
<EOS>
regardless
of
this
warning

she
capture
his
closed

its
content
again
.
<EOS>

We

go
!

<EOS>
she
repeat
,
exert
her
utmost
effort
to
cause
the
iron
muscle
to
relax
;
and
find
that
her
nail
make
no
impression
,
she
apply
her
tooth
pretty
sharply
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
glance
at
me
a
glance
that
keep
me
from
interfere
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
too
intent
on
his
finger
to
notice
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
open
them
suddenly
,
and
resign
the
object
of
dispute
;
but
,
ere
she
have
well
secure
it
,
he
seize
her
with
the
liberated
hand
,
and
,
pull
her
on
his
knee
,
administer
with
the
other
a
shower
of
terrific
slap
on
both
side
of
the
head
,
each
sufficient
to
have
fulfil
his
threat
,
have
she
be
able
to
fall
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
diabolical
violence
I
rush
on
him
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
You
villain
!
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
cry
,
"
you
villain
!

<EOS>
a
touch
on
the
chest
silence
me
:
<EOS>
I
be
stout
,
and
soon
put
out
of
breath
;
and
,
what
with
that
and
the
rage
,
I
stagger
dizzily
back
and
feel
ready
to
suffocate
,
or
to
burst
a
blood
-
vessel
.
<EOS>
the
scene
be
over
in
two
minute
;
Catherine
,
release
,
put
her
two
hand
to
her
temple
,
and
look
just
as
if
she
be
not
sure
whether
her
ear
be
off
or
on
.
<EOS>
She
tremble
like
a
reed
,
poor
thing
,
and
leant
against
the
table
perfectly
bewilder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
to
chastise
child
,
you
see

say
the
scoundrel
,
grimly
,
as
he
stoop
to
repossess
himself
of
the
key
,
which
have
drop
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
Linton
now

as
I
tell
you

cry
at
your
ease

shall
be
your
father

morrow

all
the
father
you
will
have
in
a
few
day

you
shall
have
plenty

You
can
bear
plenty
;
you
be
no
weakling

you
shall
have
a
daily
taste

I
catch
such
a

a
temper
in
your
eye
again

<EOS>
Cathy
run
to
me
instead
of
Linton
,
and
knelt
down
and
put
her
burn
cheek
on
my
lap
,
weep
aloud
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
have
shrink
into
a
corner
of
the
settle
,
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
,
congratulate
himself
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
that
the
correction
have
alight
on
another
than
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
perceive
us
all
confound
,
rise
,
and
expeditiously
make
the
tea
himself
.
<EOS>
the
cup
and
saucer
be
lay
ready
.
<EOS>
He
pour
it
out
,
and
hand
me
a
cup
.
  
<EOS>
"
wash
away
your
spleen
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
help
your
own
naughty
pet
and
mine
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
poison
,
though
I
prepare
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
out
to
seek
your
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Our
first
thought
,
on
his
departure
,
be
to
force
an
exit
somewhere
.
<EOS>
We
try
the
kitchen
door
,
but
that
be
fasten
outside
:
we
look
at
the
window
 
<EOS>
they
be
too
narrow
for
even
Cathy
's
little
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Linton
,
"
I
cry
,
see
we
be
regularly
imprison
,
"
you
know
what
your
diabolical
father
be
after
,
and
you
shall
tell
us
,
or
I
will
box
your
ear
,
as
he
have
do
your
cousin
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Linton
,
you
must
tell
,
"
say
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
your
sake
I
come
;
and
it
will
be
wickedly
ungrateful
if
you
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
some
tea
,
I
be
thirsty
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you

he
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
,
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
you
stand
over
me
.
<EOS>
now
,
Catherine
,
you
be
let
your
tear
fall
into
my
cup

<EOS>
I
will
not
drink
that
.
<EOS>
give
me
another
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
push
another
to
him
,
and
wipe
her
face
.
<EOS>
I
feel
disgusted
at
the
little
wretch
's
composure
,
since
he
be
no
longer
in
terror
for
himself
.
<EOS>
the
anguish
he
have
exhibit
on
the
moor
subside
as
soon
as
ever
he
enter
Wuthering
Heights
;
so
I
guess
he
have
be
menace
with
an
awful
visitation
of
wrath
if
he
fail
in
decoy
us
there
;
and
,
that
accomplish
,
he
have
no
further
immediate
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
want
us
to
be
marry
,
"
he
continue
,
after
sip
some
of
the
liquid
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
know
your
papa
would
not
let
us
marry
now
;
and
he
be
afraid
of
my
dying
if
we
wait
;
so
we
be
to
be

you
with
her
,
pitiful
changeling

<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
_
You

<EOS>
why

the
man
be
mad
!
<EOS>
or
he

<EOS>
and
do
you
imagine
that
beautiful
young
lady

that
healthy

hearty
girl
,
will
tie
herself
to
a
little
perishing
monkey
like
you

<EOS>
be
you
cherish
the
notion
that
anybody

let
alone
Miss
Catherine
Linton

would
have
you
for
a
husband
?
<EOS>
You
want
whip
for

in
here
at
all

with
your
dastardly
puling
trick

and
 
do
not
look
so
silly
,
now
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
good
mind
to
shake
you
severely
,
for
your
contemptible
treachery
,
and
your
imbecile
conceit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
give
him
a
slight
shaking
;
but
it
bring
on
the
cough
,
and
he
take
to
his
ordinary
resource
of
moaning
and
weeping
,
and
Catherine
rebuke
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
stay
all
night
?
<EOS>
no
,
"
she
say
,
look
slowly
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ellen
,
I
will
burn
that
door
down
<EOS>
but
I
will
get
out

"
  
<EOS>
and
she
would
have
commence
the
execution
of
her
threat
directly
,
but
Linton
be
up
in
alarm
for
his
dear
self
again
.
<EOS>
He
clasp
her
in
his
two
feeble
arm
sob
:
 
"
will
not
you
have
me
,
and
save
me

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
"
I

obey
my

she
reply
,

and
relieve
him
from
this
cruel
suspense

the
whole
night
!
<EOS>
what
would
he
think
?
<EOS>
He
will
be
distress
already

<EOS>
I
will
either
break
or
burn
a
way
out
of
the
house

<EOS>

<EOS>
You
be
in
no

me
 
Linton

of
Mr.
Heathcliff

to
the
boy
his
coward

Catherine

still

persist
that
she
must
go
home
,
and
try
entreaty
in

persuade
him
to
subdue
his

He
speak
these

hold
the
door
open
for
his
son
to
pass

achieve
his
exit
exactly

<EOS>
Catherine
look
up

instinctively
raise
her
hand
to

revive
a
painful
sensation

<EOS>
anybody
else
would
have
be
incapable

sternness

Miss
Linton

I
shall
enjoy
myself
remarkably
in

your

miserable

I
shall
not

satisfaction

You
could
have
hit
on

way

fix
your

under

roof
for
the
next
twenty

four
hour
than
inform

that

as

I

not

<EOS>
He
will
think
you
be
tired
of
wait
on
him
,
and
run
off
for
a
little
amusement

answer
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
deny
that
you
enter
my
house
of
your
own
accord
,
in
contempt
of
his
injunction
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
quite
natural
that
you
should
desire
amusement
at
your
age
;
and
that
you
would
weary
of
nurse
a
sick
man
,
and
that
man
_
<EOS>
only
_
your
father
.
<EOS>
Catherine

his
happy
day
be
over

He
curse
you

I
dare
say
,
for
come
into
the
world

I
do
,
at

)
;

it
would
just
do
if

curse
you

he

go
out

I
would
join
him

I

how
should
I
?
<EOS>
weep
away

<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
it
will
be
your
chief
diversion
hereafter
;
unless
Linton
make
amend
for
other
loss
:
and
your
provident
parent
appear
to
fancy
he
may
.
<EOS>
His
letter
of
advice
and
consolation
entertain
me
vastly
.
<EOS>
in
his
last
he
recommend
my
jewel
to
be
careful
of
his
;
and
kind
to
her
when
he
get
her
.
<EOS>
careful
and
kind
 
<EOS>
that
be
paternal
.
<EOS>
but
Linton
require
his
whole
stock
of
care
and
kindness
for
himself

<EOS>
Linton
can
play
the
little
tyrant
well
.
<EOS>
He
will
undertake
to
torture
any
number
of
cat

if
their
tooth
be
draw

their

pare

<EOS>
You
will
be

I

You

<EOS>
I

explain
your

his
resemblance

then

I
hope

Miss
Cathy
will
think
twice
before

cockatrice

<EOS>
"
I
do

quality

because

Mr.

you

brutally
repulse
her

I
would
rather
be

by
a
snake

how

dream

<EOS>
He
shrug
his
shoulder
:
shake
himself
,
indeed
,
as
if
his
flesh
creep
with
aversion
;
and
thrust
back
his
chair
;
while
I
get
up
,
and
open
my
mouth
,
to
commence
a
downright
torrent
of
abuse
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
render
dumb
in
the
middle
of
the
first
sentence
,
by
a
threat
that
I
should
be
show
into
a
room
by
myself
the
very
next
syllable
I
utter
.
<EOS>
It
be
grow
dark
 
<EOS>
we
hear
a
sound
of
voice
at
the
garden

gate

<EOS>
Our
host
hurry
out
instantly
:

he

have
his
wit
about
him

have
not

<EOS>
there
be
a
talk
of
two

three
minute
,

he
return
alone

<EOS>
"
I
think
it
have
be
your
cousin
Hareton

I
observe
to
Catherine

arrive

<EOS>
"
It

three
servant
send
to
seek
you
from

Grange

say
Heathcliff
,
overhear
me

<EOS>
"
You
should
have
open
a
lattice
and
call
out
:
but
I
could
swear
that
chit
be
glad
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
She
be
glad
to
be
oblige
to
stay
,
I
be
certain
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
learn
the
chance
we
have
miss
,
we
both
give
vent
to
our
grief
without
control
;
and
he
allow
us
to
wail
on
till
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
then
he
bid
us
go
upstairs
,
through
the
kitchen
,
to
Zillah
's
chamber
;
and
I
whisper
my
companion
to
obey
:
perhaps
we
may
contrive
to
get
through
the
window
there
,
or
into
a
garret
,
and
out
by
its
skylight
.
<EOS>
the
window
,
however
,
be
narrow
,
like
those
below
,
and
the
garret
trap
be
safe
from
our
attempt
;
for
we
be
fasten
in
as
before
.
<EOS>
We
neither
of
us
lie
down
:
<EOS>
Catherine
take
her
station
by
the
lattice
,
and
watch
anxiously
for
morning
;
a
deep
sigh
be
the
only
answer
I
could
obtain
to
my
frequent
entreaty
that
she
would
try
to
rest
.
<EOS>
I
seat
myself
in
a
chair
,
and
rock
to
and
fro
,
pass
harsh
judgment
on
my
many
dereliction
of
duty
;
from
which
,
it
strike
me
then
,
all
the
misfortune
of
my
employer
spring
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
case
,
in
reality
,
I
be
aware
;
but
it
be
,
in
my
imagination
,
that
dismal
night
;
and
I
think
Heathcliff
himself
less
guilty
than
I.
  
<EOS>
at
seven
o'clock
he
come
,
and
inquire
if
Miss
Linton
have
rise
.
<EOS>
She
run
to
the
door
immediately
,
and
answer
,
"
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
here
,
then
,
"
he
say
,
open
it
,
and
pull
her
out
.
<EOS>
I
rise
to
follow
,
but
he
turn
the
lock
again
.
<EOS>
I
demand
my
release
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
patient
,
"
he
reply
;
"
I
will
send
up
your
breakfast
in
a
while

<EOS>
"
  
I
thump
on
the
panel
,
and
rattle
the
latch
angrily
and
Catherine
ask
why
I
be
still
shut
up
?
<EOS>
He
answer
,
I
must
try
to
endure
it
another
hour
,
and
they
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
endure
it
two
or
three
hour
;
at
length
,
I
hear
a
footstep
:
<EOS>
not
Heathcliff
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
bring
you
something
to
eat
,
"
say
a
voice
;
"
oppen
t

door

<EOS>
comply
eagerly
,
I
beheld
Hareton
,
laden
with
food
enough
to
last
me
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tak
'
it
,
"
he
add
,
thrust
the
tray
into
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
stay
one
minute

I
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

cry
he
,
and
retire
,
regardless
of
any
prayer
I
could
pour
forth
to
detain
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
I
remain
enclose
the
whole
day
,
and
the
whole
of
the
next
night
;
and
another
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
five
night
and
four
day
<EOS>
I
remain
,
altogether
,
see
nobody
but
Hareton
once
every
morning
;
and
he
be
a
model
of
a
jailor
:
surly
,
and
dumb
,
and
deaf
to
every
attempt
at
move
his
sense
of
justice
or
compassion
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
morning
,
or
rather
afternoon
,
a
different
step
approach
 
light
and
short
;
and
,
this
time
,
the
person
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
Zillah
;
don
in
her
scarlet
shawl
,
with
a
black
silk
bonnet
on
her
head
,
and
a
willow
-
basket
swung
to
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

"
she
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

<EOS>

<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
"
Your

a
true
scoundrel

<EOS>
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
shall
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
nee
not
have
raise
that
tale
:
it
shall
all
be
lay
bare
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
ask
Zillah
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
his
tale
:
they
tell
that
in
the
village
 
about
your
be
lose
in
the
marsh
;
and
I
call
to
Earnshaw
,
when
I
come
in
 
<EOS>
"
eh
,
they
be
queer
thing
,
Mr.
Hareton
,

<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
pity
of
that
likely
young
lass
,
and
can
not
nelly
Dean
.
"
<EOS>
He
stare
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
not
hear
aught
,
so
I
tell
him
the
rumour
.
<EOS>
the
master
listen
,
and
he
just
smile
to
himself
,
and
say
,
"
if
they
have
be
in

marsh

<EOS>
nelly
Dean

<EOS>
You

here
be
the
key
.
<EOS>
the
bog
-
water
get
into
her
head
,
and
she
would
have
run
home
quite
flighty
;
but
I
fix
her
till
she
come
round
to
her
sense
.
<EOS>
You
can
bid
her
go
to
the
grange
at
once
,
if
she
be
able
,
and
carry
a
message
from
me
,
that
her

funeral

<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.

I
gasp

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"

she
reply
;
"

<EOS>
He
be
not
dead
;
Doctor
Kenneth
think
he
may
last
another
day
.
<EOS>
I
meet
him
on
the
road
and
ask
.
"
  
<EOS>
instead
of
sit
down
,
I
snatch
my
outdoor
thing
,
and
hasten
below
,
for
the
way
be
free
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
house
,
I
look
about
for
some
one
to
give
information
of
Catherine
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
fill
with
sunshine
,
and
the
door
stand
wide
open
;
but
nobody
seem
at
hand
.
<EOS>
as
I
hesitate
whether
to
go
off
at
once
,
or
return
and
seek
my
mistress
,
a
slight
cough
draw
my
attention
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Linton
lie
on
the
settle
,
sole
tenant
,
suck
a
stick
of
sugar
-
candy
,
and
pursue
my
movement
with
apathetic
eye
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
Miss
Catherine
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
sternly
,
suppose
I
could
frighten
him
into
give
intelligence
,
by
catch
him
thus
,
alone
.
<EOS>
He
suck
on
like
an
innocent

<EOS>
"

I
say

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
direct
me
to
her
room
immediately

I
will
make
you
sing
out
sharply

<EOS>
"
Papa
would
make
you
sing
out

if

to
get
there

"
he
answer
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
I
be
not
to
be
soft
with
Catherine
:
she
be
my
wife
,
and
it
be
shameful
that
she
should
wish
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
hate
me
and
want
me
to
die
,
that
she
may
have
my
money
;
but
she
shall
not
have
it
:
and
she
shall
not
go
home
!
<EOS>
She
never
shall
!
 
<EOS>
she
may
cry
,
and
be
sick
as
much
as
she
please

"
  
<EOS>
He
resume
his
former
occupation
,
close
his
lid
,
as
if
he
mean
to
drop
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Heathcliff

"
<EOS>
I
resume
,
"
have
you
forget
all
Catherine

kindness

you
song

and
come
many
a
time
through
wind
and
snow
to
see
you

<EOS>
She
weep
to
miss
one
evening
,
because
you
would
be
disappointed
;
and
you
feel
then
that
she
be
a
hundred
time
too
good
to
you
:
and
now
you
believe
the
lie
your
father
tell
,
though
you
know
he
detest
you
both

<EOS>
and
you
join
him
against

fine
gratitude

<EOS>
the
corner
of
Linton

mouth
fall
,

take
the
sugar

candy
from
his
lip

"
do
she
come
to
Wuthering
Heights
because
she
hate
you

"
I
continue

<EOS>

think
for
yourself

<EOS>
as
to
your
money

she
do
not
even
know
that
you
will
have
any

<EOS>
and
you
say
she
be
sick

and
yet
you
leave
her
alone

up
there
in
a
strange
house

<EOS>
You
who
have
feel
what
it
be
to
be
so
neglect
!
<EOS>
You
could
pity
your

you

hers

<EOS>
I
shed
tear

Master
Heathcliff

you

an

woman

servant
merely

have
reason

worship

store
every

you

selfish

<EOS>

I
can

he
answer
crossly

<EOS>
"
I
will
not
stay
by
myself

<EOS>
She
cry
so
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
and
she
will
not
give
over
,
though
I
say
I
will
call
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
do
call
him
once
,
and
he
threaten
to
strangle
her
if
she
be
not
quiet
;
but
she
begin
again
the
instant
he
leave
the
room
,
moan
and
grieve
all
night
long

I
scream
for
vexation
that
I
could
not
sleep

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Heathcliff
out
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
perceive
that
the
wretched
creature
have
no
power
to
sympathize
with
his
cousin
's
mental
torture

<EOS>
"
He
be
in
the
court

"
he
reply

"
talk
to
Doctor
Kenneth

who

truly

at

<EOS>
I
be
glad

<EOS>
Catherine
always
speak
of
it
as
her
house

<EOS>
It
be
not
her

<EOS>
It
be
mine

papa
say
everything
she
have
be
mine

<EOS>
all
her
nice
book
be
mine
;
she
offer
to
give
me
them
,
and
her
pretty
bird
,
and
her
pony
Minny

if
I
would
get
the
key
of
our
room

and
let
her
out

but
I
tell
her
she
have
nothing
to
give
,
they
be
all
,
all
mine

<EOS>
and
then
she
cry
,
and
take
a
little
picture
from
her
neck

and
say
I
should
have
that

two
picture
in
a
gold
case

on

side
her

on

that
be
yesterday
 
<EOS>
I
say
they
be
mine

too
;

try
to
get
them
from
her
.
<EOS>
the
spiteful
thing
would
not
let
me
:
she
push
me
off
,
and
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
I
shriek
out
 
that
frighten
<EOS>
her
 
<EOS>
she
hear
papa
come
,
and
she
break
the
hinge
and
divide
the
case
,
and
give
me
her
mother
's
portrait
;
the
other
she
attempt
to
hide
:
but
papa
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
and
I
explain
it
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
one
I
have
away
,
and
order
her
to
resign
her
to
me
;
she
refuse
,
and
he
 
he
strike
her
down
,
and
wrench
it
off
the
chain
,
and
crush
it
with
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
you
pleased
to
see
her
strike
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
:
have
my
design
in
encourage
his
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wink
,
"
he
answer
:
"
I
wink
to
see
my
father
strike
a
dog
or
a
horse
,
he
do
it
so
hard

<EOS>
yet
I
be
glad
at
first
 
<EOS>
she
deserve
punish
for
push
me
:
but
when
papa
be
go
,
she
make
me
come
to
the
window
and
show
me
her
cheek
cut
on
the
inside
,
against
her
tooth
,
and
her
mouth
fill
with
blood
;
and
then
she
gather
up
the
bit
of
the
picture
,
and
go
and
sit
down
with
her
face
to
the
wall
,
and
she
have
never
speak
to
me
since
:
<EOS>
and
I
sometimes
think
she
can
not
speak
for
pain
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
think
so
;
but
she
be
a
naughty
thing
for
cry
continually
;
and
she
look
so
pale
and
wild
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
can
get
the
key
if
you
choose
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
when
I
be
up
-
stair
,

he
answer
;
"
but
I
can
not
walk
up
-
stair
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
apartment
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
he
cry
,
"
I
shall
not
tell
_
you
_
where
it
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
secret
.
<EOS>
nobody
,
neither
Hareton
nor
Zillah
,
be
to

<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
you
have
tire
me
 
<EOS>
go
away
,
go
away
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
turn
his
face
on
to
his
arm
,
and
shut
his
eye
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
consider
it
best
to
depart
without
see
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
bring
a
rescue
for
my
young
lady
from
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
on
reach
it
,
the
astonishment
of
my
fellow
-
servant
to
see
me
,
and
their
joy
also
,
be
intense
;
and
when
they
hear
that
their
little
mistress
be
safe
,
two
or
three
be
about
to
hurry
up
and
shout
the
news
at
Mr.
Edgar
's
door
:
<EOS>
but
I
bespoke
the
announcement
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
how
change
I
find
him
,
even
in
those
few
day
!
<EOS>
He
lie
an
image
of
sadness
and
resignation
await
his
death
.
<EOS>
very
young
he
look
:
though
his
actual
age
be
thirty
-
nine
,
one
would
have
call
him
ten
year
young
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
Catherine
;
for
he
murmur
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
touch
his
hand
,
and
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
be
come
,
dear
master
!
"
<EOS>
I
whisper
;
"
she
be
alive
and
well
;
and
will
be
here
,
I
hope
,
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tremble
at
the
first
effect
of
this
intelligence
:
he
half
rise
up
,
look
eagerly
round
the
apartment
,
and
then
sink
back
in
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
recover
,
I
relate
our
compulsory
visit
,
and
detention
at
the
Heights
.
<EOS>
I
say
Heathcliff
force
me
to
go
in
:
which
be
not
quite
true
.
<EOS>
I
utter
as
little
as
possible
against
Linton
;
nor
do
I
describe
all
his
father
's
brutal
conduct
 
<EOS>
my
intention
be
to
add
no
bitterness
,
if
I
could
help
it
,
to
his
already
over
-
flow
cup
.
  
<EOS>
He
divine
that
one
of
his
enemy
's
purpose
be
to
secure
the
personal
property
,
as
well
as
the
estate
,
to
his
son
:
or
rather
himself
;
yet
why
he
do
not
wait
till
his
decease
be
a
puzzle
to
my
master
,
because
ignorant
how
nearly
he
and
his
nephew
would
quit
the
world
together
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
feel
that
his
will
have
better
be
alter
:
<EOS>
instead
of
leave
Catherine
's
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
,
he
determine
to
put
it
in
the
hand
of
trustee
for
her
use
during
life
,
and
for
her
child
,
if
she
have
any
,
after
her
.
<EOS>
by
that
mean
,
it
could
not
fall
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
should
Linton
die
.
  
<EOS>
have
receive
his
order
,
I
despatch
a
man
to
fetch
the
attorney
,
and
four
more
,
provide
with
serviceable
weapon
,
to
demand
my
young
lady
of
her
jailor
.
<EOS>
both
party
be
delay
very
late
.
<EOS>
the
single
servant
return
first
.
<EOS>
He
say
Mr.
Green
,
the
lawyer
,
be
out
when
he
arrive
at
his
house
,
and
he
have
to
wait
two
hour
for
his
re
-
entrance
;
and
then
Mr.
Green
tell
him
he
have
a
little
business
in
the
village
that
must
be
do
;
but
he
would
be
at
Thrushcross
Grange
before
morning
.
<EOS>
the
four
man
come
back
unaccompanied
also
.
<EOS>
They
bring
word
that
Catherine
be
ill
:
too
ill
to
quit
her
room
;
and
Heathcliff
would
not
suffer
them
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
scold
the
stupid
fellow
well
for
listen
to
that
tale
,
which
I
would
not
carry
to
my
master
;
resolve
to
take
a
whole
bevy
up
to
the
Heights
,
at
day
-
light
,
and
storm
it
literally
,
unless
the
prisoner
be
quietly
surrender
to
us
.
<EOS>
Her
father
_
shall
_
see
her
,
I
vow
,
and
vow
again
,
if
that
devil
be
kill
on
his
own
doorstone
in
try
to
prevent
it
!
  
<EOS>
happily
,
I
be
spare
the
journey
and
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
have
go
down
-
stair
at
three
o'clock
to
fetch
a
jug
of
water
;
and
be
pass
through
the
hall
with
it
in
my
hand
,
when
a
sharp
knock
at
the
front
door
make
me
jump
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
Green
,
"
I
say
,
recollect
myself
 
"
only
Green
,
"
and
I
go
on
,
intend
to
send
somebody
else
to
open
it
;
but
the
knock
be
repeat
:
not
loud
,
and
still
importunately
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
jug
on
the
banister
and
hasten
to
admit
him
myself
.
<EOS>
the
harvest
moon
shine
clear
outside
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
My
own
sweet
little
mistress
spring
on
my
neck
sob
,
"
Ellen
,
Ellen
!
<EOS>
be
papa
alive
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
cry
:
"
yes
,
my
angel
,
he
be
,
God
be
thank
,
you
be
safe
with
us
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
want
to
run
,
breathless
as
she
be
,
up
-
stair
to
Mr.
Linton
's
room
;
but
I
compel
her
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
,
and
make
her
drink
,
and
wash
her
pale
face
,
chafe
it
into
a
faint
colour
with
my
apron
.
<EOS>
then
I
say
I
must
go
first
,
and
tell
of
her
arrival
;
implore
her
to
say
,
she
should
be
happy
with
young
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
She
stare
,
but
soon
comprehend
why
I
counsel
her
to
utter
the
falsehood
,
she
assure
me
she
would
not
complain
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
abide
to
be
present
at
their
meeting
.
<EOS>
I
stand
outside
the
chamber
-
door
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
hardly
venture
near
the
bed
,
then
.
<EOS>
all
be
compose
,
however
:
Catherine
's
despair
be
as
silent
as
her
father
's
joy
.
<EOS>
She
support
him
calmly
,
in
appearance
;
and
he
fix
on
her
feature
his
raise
eye
that
seem
dilate
with
ecstasy
.
  
<EOS>
He
die
blissfully
,
Mr.
Lockwood
:
he
die
so
.
<EOS>
kiss
her
cheek
,
he
murmur
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
her
;
and
you
,
darle
child
,
shall
come
to
us
!
"
and
never
stir
or
speak
again
;
but
continue
that
rapt
,
radiant
gaze
,
till
his
pulse
imperceptibly
stop
and
his
soul
depart
.
<EOS>
none
could
have
notice
the
exact
minute
of
his
death
,
it
be
so
entirely
without
a
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
whether
Catherine
have
spend
her
tear
,
or
whether
the
grief
be
too
weighty
to
let
them
flow
,
she
sit
there
dry
-
eyed
till
the
sun
rise
:
she
sit
till
noon
,
and
would
still
have
remain
brood
over
that
deathbed
,
but
I
insist
on
her
come
away
and
take
some
repose
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
<EOS>
I
succeed
in
remove
her
,
for
at
dinner
-
time
<EOS>
appear
the
lawyer
,
have
call
at
Wuthering
Heights
to
get
his
instruction
how
to
behave
.
<EOS>
He
have
sell
himself
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
that
be
the
cause
of
his
delay
in
obey
my
master
's
summon
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
no
thought
of
worldly
affair
cross
the
latter
's
mind
,
to
disturb
him
,
after
his
daughter
's
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Green
take
upon
himself
to
order
everything
and
everybody
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
give
all
the
servant
but
me
,
notice
to
quit
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
carry
his
delegated
authority
to
the
point
of
insist
that
Edgar
Linton
should
not
be
bury
beside
his
wife
,
but
in
the
chapel
,
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
will
,
however
,
to
hinder
that
,
and
my
loud
protestation
against
any
infringement
of
its
direction
.
<EOS>
the
funeral
be
hurry
over
;
Catherine
,
Mrs.
Linton
Heathcliff
now
,
be
suffer
to
stay
at
the
Grange
till
her
father
's
corpse
have
quit
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
tell
me
that
her
anguish
have
at
last
spur
Linton
to
incur
the
risk
of
liberate
her
.
<EOS>
She
hear
the
man
I
send
dispute
at
the
door
,
and
she
gather
the
sense
of
Heathcliff
's
answer
.
<EOS>
It
drive
her
desperate
.
<EOS>
Linton
who
have
be
convey
up
to
the
little
parlour
soon
after
I
leave
,
be
terrify
into
fetch
the
key
before
his
father
re
-
ascend
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
cunning
to
unlock
and
re
-
lock
the
door
,
without
shut
it
;
and
when
he
should
have
go
to
bed
,
he
beg
to
sleep
with
Hareton
,
and
his
petition
be
grant
for
once
.
<EOS>
Catherine
steal
out
before
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
She
dare
not
try
the
door
lest
the
dog
should
raise
an
alarm
;
she
visit
the
empty
chamber
and
examine
their
window
;
and
,
luckily
,
light
on
her
mother
's
,
she
get
easily
out
of
its
lattice
,
and
on
to
the
ground
,
by
mean
of
the
fir
-
tree
close
by
.
<EOS>
Her
accomplice
suffer
for
his
share
in
the
escape
,
notwithstanding
his
timid
contrivance
.
    
<EOS>
the
evening
after
the
funeral
,
my
young
lady
and
I
be
seat
in
the
library
;
now
muse
mournfully
 
one
of
us
despairingly
 
on
our
loss
,
now
venture
conjecture
as
to
the
gloomy
future
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
agree
the
good
destiny
which
could
await
Catherine
would
be
a
permission
to
continue
resident
at
the
grange
;
at
least
during
Linton
's
life
:
he
be
allow
to
join
her
there
,
and
I
to
remain
as
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
that
seem
rather
too
favourable
an
arrangement
to
be
hope
for
;
and
yet
I
do
hope
,
and
begin
to
cheer
up
under
the
prospect
of
retain
my
home
and
my
employment
,
and
,
above
all
,
my
beloved
young
mistress
;
when
a
servant
 
one
of
the
discard
one
,
not
yet
depart
 
rush
hastily
in
,
and
say
"
that
devil
Heathcliff
"
be
come
through
the
court
:
should
he
fasten
the
door
in
his
face
?
  
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
mad
enough
to
order
that
proceeding
,
we
have
not
time
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
ceremony
of
knock
or
announce
his
name
:
he
be
master
,
and
avail
himself
of
the
master
's
privilege
to
walk
straight
in
,
without
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
our
informant
's
voice
direct
him
to
the
library
;
he
enter
and
motion
him
out
,
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
room
into
which
he
have
be
usher
,
as
a
guest
,
eighteen
year
before
:
the
same
moon
shine
through
the
window
;
and
the
same
autumn
landscape
lie
outside
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
yet
light
a
candle
,
but
all
the
apartment
be
visible
,
even
to
the
portrait
on
the
wall
:
<EOS>
the
splendid
head
of
Mrs.
Linton
,
and
the
graceful
one
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
advance
to
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Time
have
little
alter
his
person
either
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
man
:
his
dark
face
rather
sallower
and
more
composed
,
his
frame
a
stone
or
two
heavy
,
perhaps
,
and
no
other
difference
.
<EOS>
Catherine
have
rise
with
an
impulse
to
dash
out
,
when
she
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
arrest
her
by
the
arm
.
"
<EOS>
no
more
running
away
!
<EOS>
where
would
you
go
?
<EOS>
I
be
come
to
fetch
you
home
;
and
I
hope
you
will
be
a
dutiful
daughter
and
not
encourage
my
son
to
further
disobedience
.
<EOS>
I
be
embarrass
how
to
punish
him
when
I
discover
his
part
in
the
business
:
he
be
such
a
cobweb
,
a
pinch
would
annihilate
him
;
but
you
will
see
by
his
look
that
he
have
receive
his
due
!
<EOS>
I
bring
him
down
one
evening
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
just
set
him
in
a
chair
,
and
never
touch
him
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
send
Hareton
out
,
and
we
have
the
room
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
in
two
hour
,
I
call
Joseph
to
carry
him
up
again
;
and
since
then
my
presence
be
as
potent
on
his
nerve
as
a
ghost
;
and
I
fancy
he
see
me
often
,
though
I
be
not
near
.
<EOS>
Hareton
say
he
wake
and
shriek
in
the
night
by
the
hour
together
,
and
call
you
to
protect
him
from
me
;
and
,
whether
you
like
your
precious
mate
,
or
not
,
you
must
come
:
he
be
your
concern
now
;
I
yield
all
my
interest
in
him
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
let
Catherine
continue
here
,
"
I
plead
,
"
and
send
Master
Linton
to
her
?
<EOS>
as
you
hate
them
both
,
you
would
not
miss
them
:
they
can
only
be
a
daily
plague
to
your
unnatural
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
seek
a
tenant
for
the
Grange
,
"
he
answer
;
"
and
I
want
my
child
about
me
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
besides
,
that
lass
owe
me
her
service
for
her
bread
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
nurture
her
in
luxury
and
idleness
after
Linton
be
go
.
<EOS>
make
haste
and
get
ready
,
now
;
and
do
not
oblige
me
to
compel
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
,
"
say
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Linton
be
all
I
have
to
love
in
the
world
,
and
though
you
have
do
what
you
could
to
make
him
hateful
to
me
,
and
me
to
him
,
you
can
not
make
us
hate
each
other
.
<EOS>
and
I
defy
you
to
hurt
him
when
I
be
by
,
and
I
defy
you
to
frighten
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
boastful
champion
,
"
reply
Heathcliff
;
"
but
I
do
not
like
you
well
enough
to
hurt
him
:
you
shall
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
torment
,
as
long
as
it
last
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
I
who
will
make
him
hateful
to
you
 
<EOS>
it
be
his
own
sweet
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
bitter
as
gall
at
your
desertion
and
its
consequence
:
do
not
expect
thank
for
this
noble
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
draw
a
pleasant
picture
to
Zillah
of
what
he
would
do
if
he
be
as
strong
as
I
:
the
inclination
be
there
,
and
his
very
weakness
will
sharpen
his
wit
to
find
a
substitute
for
strength
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
have
a
bad
nature
,
"
say
Catherine
:
"
he
be
your
son
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
glad
I
have
a
well
,
to
forgive
it
;
and
I
know
he
love
me
,
and
for
that
reason
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
_
<EOS>
you
_
have
_
nobody
_
to
love
you
;
and
,
however
miserable
you
make
us
,
we
shall
still
have
the
revenge
of
thinking
that
your
cruelty
arise
from
your
great
misery
.
<EOS>
You
_
be
_
miserable
,
be
you
not
?
<EOS>
lonely
,
like
the
devil
,
and
envious
like
him
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Nobody
_
love
you
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
nobody
_
will
cry
for
you
when
you
die
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
speak
with
a
kind
of
dreary
triumph
:
she
seem
to
have
make
up
her
mind
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
her
future
family
,
and
draw
pleasure
from
the
griefs
of
her
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
sorry
to
be
yourself
presently
,
"
say
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
if
you
stand
there
another
minute
.
<EOS>
begone
,
witch
,
and
get
your
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
scornfully
withdraw
.
<EOS>
in
her
absence
I
begin
to
beg
for
Zillah
's
place
at
the
Heights
,
offer
to
resign
mine
to
her
;
but
he
would
suffer
it
on
no
account
.
<EOS>
He
bid
me
be
silent
;
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
allow
himself
a
glance
round
the
room
and
a
look
at
the
picture
.
<EOS>
have
study
Mrs.
Linton
's
,
he
say
 
"
I
shall
have
that
home
.
<EOS>
not
because
I
need
it
,
but
 
"
He
turn
abruptly
to
the
fire
,
and
continue
,
with
what
,
for
lack
of
a
well
word
,
I
must
call
a
smile
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
do
yesterday
!
<EOS>
I
get
the
sexton
,
who
be
dig
Linton
's
grave
,
to
remove
the
earth
off
her
coffin
lid
,
and
I
open
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
once
,
I
would
have
stay
there
:
when
I
see
her
face
again
 
<EOS>
it
be
her
yet
!
 
<EOS>
he
have
hard
work
to
stir
me
;
but
he
say
it
would
change
if
the
air
blow
on
it
,
and
so
I
strike
one
side
of
the
coffin
loose
,
and
cover
it
up
:
not
Linton
's
side
,
damn
him
!
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
be
solder
in
lead
.
<EOS>
and
I
bribe
the
sexton
to
pull
it
away
when
I
be
lay
there
,
and
slide
mine
out
too
;
I
will
have
it
make
so
:
and
then
by
the
time
Linton
get
to
us
he
will
not
know
which
be
which
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
wicked
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
;
"
be
you
not
ashamed
to
disturb
the
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
disturb
nobody
,
nelly
,
"
he
reply
;
"
and
I
give
some
ease
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
now
;
and
you
will
have
a
well
chance
of
keep
me
underground
,
when
I
get
there
.
<EOS>
disturb
her
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
have
disturb
me
,
night
and
day
,
through
eighteen
year
 
incessantly
 
remorselessly
 
till
yesternight
;
and
yesternight
<EOS>
I
be
tranquil
.
<EOS>
I
dreamt
<EOS>
I
be
sleep
the
last
sleep
by
that
sleeper
,
with
my
heart
stop
and
my
cheek
freeze
against
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
she
have
be
dissolve
into
earth
,
or
bad
,
what
would
you
have
dreamt
of
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
dissolve
with
her

and
be
more
happy
still
!
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
I
dread
any
change
of
that
sort
?
<EOS>
I
expect
such
a
transformation
on
raise
the
lid
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
better
pleased
that
it
should
not
commence
till
I
share
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
unless
I
have
receive
a
distinct
impression
of
her
passionless
feature
,
that
strange
feeling
would
hardly
have
be
remove
.
<EOS>
It
begin
oddly
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
wild
after
she
die
;
and
eternally
,
from
dawn
to
dawn
,
pray
her
to
return
to
me
her
spirit
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
faith
in
ghost
:
I
have
a
conviction
that
they
can
,
and
do
,
exist
among
us
!
<EOS>
the
day
she
be
bury
,
there
come
a
fall
of
snow
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
I
go
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
It
blow
bleak
as
winter
 
<EOS>
all
round
be
solitary
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
fear
that
her
fool
of
a
husband
would
wander
up
the
glen
so
late
;
and
no
one
else
have
business
to
bring
them
there
.
<EOS>
be
alone
,
and
conscious
two
yard
of
loose
earth
be
the
sole
barrier
between
us
,
I
say
to
myself
 
"
I
will
have
her
in
my
arm
again
!
<EOS>
if
she
be
cold
,
I
will
think
it
be
this
north
wind
that
chill
_
me
_
;
and
if
she
be
motionless
,
it
be
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
a
spade
from
the
tool
-
house
,
and
begin
to
delve
with
all
my
might
 
<EOS>
it
scrape
the
coffin
;
I
fall
to
work
with
my
hand
;
the
wood
commence
crack
about
the
screw
;
I
be
on
the
point
of
attain
my
object
,
when
it
seem
that
I
hear
a
sigh
from
some
one
above
,
close
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
,
and
bend
down
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
only
get
this
off
,
"
I
mutter
,
"
I
wish
they
may
shovel
in
the
earth
over
us
both
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
wrench
at
it
more
desperately
still
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
sigh
,
close
at
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
appear
to
feel
the
warm
breath
of
it
displace
the
sleet
-
laden
wind
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
live
thing
in
flesh
and
blood
be
by
;
but
,
as
certainly
as
you
perceive
the
approach
to
some
substantial
body
in
the
dark
,
though
it
can
not
be
discern
,
so
certainly
I
feel
that
Cathy
be
there
:
not
under
me
,
but
on
the
earth
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
flow
from
my
heart
through
every
limb
.
<EOS>
I
relinquish
my
labour
of
agony
,
and
turn
consoled
at
once
:
unspeakably
console
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
be
with
me
:
it
remain
while
I
re
-
fill
the
grave
,
and
lead
me
home
.
<EOS>
You
may
laugh
,
if
you
will
;
but
I
be
sure
I
should
see
her
there
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
be
with
me
,
and
I
could
not
help
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
have
reach
the
Heights
,
I
rush
eagerly
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
fasten
;
and
,
I
remember
,
that
accurse
Earnshaw
and
my
wife
oppose
my
entrance
.
<EOS>
I
remember
stop
to
kick
the
breath
out
of
him
,
and
then
hurry
up
-
stair
,
to
my
room
and
her
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
impatiently
 
<EOS>
I
feel
her
by
me
 
<EOS>
I
could
_
<EOS>
almost
_
see
her
,
and
yet
I
_
could
not
_
!
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
sweat
blood
then
,
from
the
anguish
of
my
yearning
 
from
the
fervour
of
my
supplication
to
have
but
one
glimpse
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
one
.
<EOS>
She
show
herself
,
as
she
often
be
in
life
,
a
devil
to
me
!
<EOS>
and
,
since
then
,
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
,
I
have
be
the
sport
of
that
intolerable
torture
!
<EOS>
infernal
!
<EOS>
keep
my
nerve
at
such
a
stretch
that
,
if
they
have
not
resemble
catgut
,
they
would
long
ago
have
relax
to
the
feebleness
of
Linton
's
.
<EOS>
when
I
sit
in
the
house
with
Hareton
,
it
seem
that
on
go
out
I
should
meet
her
;
when
I
walk
on
the
moor
I
should
meet
her
come
in
.
<EOS>
when
I
go
from
home
I
hasten
to
return
;
she
_
must
_
be
somewhere
at
the
Heights
<EOS>
,
I
be
certain
!
<EOS>
and
when
I
sleep
in
her
chamber
 
<EOS>
I
be
beat
out
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
lie
there
;
for
the
moment
I
close
my
eye
,
she
be
either
outside
the
window
,
or
slide
back
the
panel
,
or
enter
the
room
,
or
even
rest
her
darle
head
on
the
same
pillow
as
she
do
when
a
child
;
and
I
must
open
my
lid
to
see
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
open
and
close
them
a
hundred
time
a
night
 
to
be
always
disappointed
!
<EOS>
It
rack
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
often
groan
aloud
,
till
that
old
rascal
Joseph
no
doubt
believe
that
my
conscience
be
play
the
fiend
inside
of
me
.
<EOS>
now
,
since
I
have
see
her
,
I
be
pacify
 
a
little
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
way
of
kill
:
not
by
inch
,
but
by
fraction
of
hairbreadth
,
to
beguile
me
with
the
spectre
of
a
hope
through
eighteen
year
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
pause
and
wipe
his
forehead
;
his
hair
clung
to
it
,
wet
with
perspiration
;
his
eye
be
fix
on
the
red
ember
of
the
fire
,
the
brow
not
contract
,
but
raise
next
the
temple
;
diminish
the
grim
aspect
of
his
countenance
,
but
impart
a
peculiar
look
of
trouble
,
and
a
painful
appearance
of
mental
tension
towards
one
absorb
subject
.
<EOS>
He
only
half
address
me
,
and
I
maintain
silence
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
hear
him
talk
!
<EOS>
after
a
short
period
he
resume
his
meditation
on
the
picture
,
take
it
down
and
leant
it
against
the
sofa
to
contemplate
it
at
well
advantage
;
and
while
so
occupied
Catherine
enter
,
announce
that
she
be
ready
,
when
her
pony
should
be
saddle
.
  
<EOS>
"
send
that
over
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Heathcliff
to
me
;
then
turn
to
her
,
he
add
:
"
You
may
do
without
your
pony
:
it
be
a
fine
evening
,
and
you
will
need
no
pony
at
Wuthering
Heights
;
for
what
journey
you
take
,
your
own
foot
will
serve
you
.
<EOS>
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
Ellen
!
"
whisper
my
dear
little
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
kiss
me
,
her
lip
feel
like
ice
.
<EOS>
"
come
and
see
me
,
Ellen
;
do
not
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
you
do
no
such
thing
,
Mrs.
Dean
!
"
say
her
new
father
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
I
will
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
want
none
of
your
prying
at
my
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
sign
her
to
precede
him
;
and
cast
back
a
look
that
cut
my
heart
,
she
obey
.
<EOS>
I
watch
them
,
from
the
window
,
walk
down
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
fix
Catherine
's
arm
under
his
:
though
she
dispute
the
act
at
first
evidently
;
and
with
rapid
stride
he
hurry
her
into
the
alley
,
whose
tree
conceal
them
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
pay
a
visit
to
the
Heights
,
but
I
have
not
see
her
since
she
leave
:
<EOS>
Joseph
hold
the
door
in
his
hand
when
I
call
to
ask
after
her
,
and
would
not
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
He
say
Mrs.
Linton
be
"
thrang
,
"
and
the
master
be
not
in
.
<EOS>
Zillah
have
tell
me
something
of
the
way
they
go
on
,
otherwise
I
should
hardly
know
who
be
dead
and
who
live
.
<EOS>
She
think
Catherine
haughty
,
and
do
not
like
her
,
I
can
guess
by
her
talk
.
<EOS>
My
young
lady
ask
some
aid
of
her
when
she
first
come
;
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
tell
her
to
follow
her
own
business
,
and
let
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
look
after
herself
;
and
Zillah
willingly
acquiesce
,
be
a
narrow
-
minded
,
selfish
woman
.
<EOS>
Catherine
evince
a
child
's
annoyance
at
this
neglect
;
repay
it
with
contempt
,
and
thus
enlist
my
informant
among
her
enemy
,
as
securely
as
if
she
have
do
her
some
great
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
long
talk
with
Zillah
about
six
week
ago
,
a
little
before
you
come
,
one
day
when
we
foregather
on
the
moor
;
and
this
be
what
she
tell
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
thing
Mrs.
Linton
do
,
"
she
say
,
"
on
her
arrival
at
the
Heights
,
be
to
run
up
-
stair
,
without
even
wish
good
-
evening
to
me
and
Joseph
;
she
shut
herself
into
Linton
's
room
,
and
remain
till
morning
.
<EOS>
then
,
while
the
master
and
Earnshaw
be
at
breakfast
,
she
enter
the
house
,
and
ask
all
in
a
quiver
if
the
doctor
may
be
send
for
?
<EOS>
her
cousin
be
very
ill
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
We
know
that
!
"
<EOS>
answer
Heathcliff
;
"
but
his
life
be
not
worth
a
farthing
,
and
I
will
not
spend
a
farthing
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
but
I
can
not
tell
how
to
do
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
if
nobody
will
help
me
,
he
will
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
walk
out
of
the
room
,
"
cry
the
master
,
"
and
let
me
never
hear
a
word
more
about
him
!
<EOS>
none
here
care
what
become
of
him
;
if
you
do
,
act
the
nurse
;
if
you
do
not
,
lock
him
up
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
begin
to
bother
me
,
and
I
say
I
would
have
enough
plague
with
the
tiresome
thing
;
we
each
have
our
task
,
and
her
be
to
wait
on
Linton
<EOS>
:
Mr.
Heathcliff
bid
me
leave
that
labour
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
they
manage
together
,
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
he
fret
a
great
deal
,
and
moan
hisseln
night
and
day
;
and
she
have
precious
little
rest
:
one
could
guess
by
her
white
face
and
heavy
eye
.
<EOS>
She
sometimes
come
into
the
kitchen
all
wildere
like
,
and
look
as
if
she
would
fain
beg
assistance
;
but
I
be
not
go
to
disobey
the
master
:
<EOS>
I
never
dare
disobey
him
,
Mrs.
Dean
;
and
,
though
I
think
it
wrong
that
Kenneth
should
not
be
send
for
,
it
be
no
concern
of
mine
either
to
advise
or
complain
,
and
I
always
refuse
to
meddle
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
,
after
we
have
go
to
bed
,
I
have
happen
to
open
my
door
again
and
see
her
sit
cry
on
the
stairs'-top
;
and
then
I
have
shut
myself
in
quick
,
for
fear
of
be
move
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
do
pity
her
then
,
I
be
sure
:
still
I
do
not
wish
to
lose
my
place
,
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
last
,
one
night
she
come
boldly
into
my
chamber
,
and
frighten
me
out
of
my
wit
,
by
say
,
"
tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
that
his
son
be
die
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
be
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
get
up
,
instantly
,
and
tell
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
utter
this
speech
,
she
vanish
again
.
<EOS>
I
lie
a
quarter
of
an
hour
listening
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
nothing
stir
 
the
house
be
quiet

She
be
mistaken
,
I
say
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
be
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
disturb
them
;
and
I
begin
to
doze
.
<EOS>
but
my
sleep
be
mar
a
second
time
by
a
sharp
ringing
of
the
bell
 
<EOS>
the
only
bell
we
have
,
put
up
on
purpose
for
Linton
;
and
the
master
call
to
me
to
see
what
be
the
matter
,
and
inform
them
that
he
would
not
have
that
noise
repeat

I
deliver
Catherine
's
message

<EOS>
He
curse
to
himself
,
and
in
a
few
minute
come
out
with
a
light
candle
,
and
proceed
to
their
room

I
follow

Mrs.
Heathcliff

He

I
be
free

she
answer
:
"
I
should
feel
well
 
<EOS>
but
,
"
she
continue
,
with
a
bitterness
she
could
not
conceal
,
"
you
have
leave
me
so
long
to
struggle
against
death
alone

that
I
feel

death

I
feel
like
death

she
look
like

too

I
give
her
a
little
wine

<EOS>
Hareton
and
Joseph

who
have
be
waken
by
the
ringing
and
the
sound
of
foot

hear
our
talk
from
outside
,
now
enter
.
<EOS>
Joseph
be
fain
,
I
believe
,
of
the
lad
's
removal
;
Hareton
seem
a
thought
bothered
:
though
he
be
more
take
up
with
stare
at
Catherine
than
thinking
of
Linton

but
the
master
bid
him
get
off
to
bed
again

we
do
not
want
his
help

He
afterwards
make
Joseph
remove
the
body
to
his
chamber

tell
me
to
return
to
mine

in
the
morning

upstairs
a
fortnight
,
accord
to
Zillah
;
who
visit
her
twice
a
day
,
and
would
have
be
rather
more
friendly
,
but
her
attempt
at
increase
kindness
be
proudly
and
promptly
repel
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
go
up
once
,
to
show
her
Linton
's
will
.
<EOS>
He
have
bequeath
the
whole
of
his
,
and
what
have
be
her
,
moveable
property
,
to
his
father
:
the
poor
creature
be
threaten
,
or
coax
,
into
that
act
during
her
week
's
absence
,
when
his
uncle
die
.
<EOS>
the
land
,
be
a
minor
,
he
could
not
meddle
with
.
<EOS>
however
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
have
claim
and
keep
them
in
his
wife
's
right
and
his
also
:
I
suppose
legally
;
at
any
rate
,
Catherine
,
destitute
of
cash
and
friend
,
can
not
disturb
his
possession
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
,
"
say
Zillah
,
"
ever
approach
her
door
,
except
that
once
,
but
I
;
and
nobody
ask
anything
about
her
.
<EOS>
the
first
occasion
of
her
come
down
into
the
house
be
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
She
have
cry
out
,
when
I
carry
up
her
dinner
,
that
she
could
not
bear
any
longer
be
in
the
cold
;
and
I
tell
her
the
master
be
go
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
Earnshaw
and
I
need
not
hinder
her
from
descend
;
so
,
as
soon
as
she
hear
Heathcliff
's
horse
trot
off
,
she
make
her
appearance
,
don
in
black
,
and
her
yellow
curl
comb
back
behind
her
ear
as
plain
as
a
quaker
<EOS>
:
she
could
not
comb
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joseph
and
I
generally
go
to
chapel
on
Sundays
:
"
the
kirk
,
you
know
,
have
no
minister
now
,
explain
Mrs.
Dean
;
and
they
call
the
Methodists
'
or
Baptists
'
place
(
I
can
not
say
which
it
be
)
at
Gimmerton
,
a
chapel
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
have
go
,
"
she
continue
,
"
but
I
think
proper
to
bide
at
home
.
<EOS>
young
folk
be
always
the
well
for
an
elder
's
over
-
look
;
and
Hareton
,
with
all
his
bashfulness
,
be
not
a
model
of
nice
behaviour
.
<EOS>
I
let
him
know
that
his
cousin
would
very
likely
sit
with
us
,
and
she
have
be
always
use
to
see
the
Sabbath
respect
;
so
he
have
as
good
leave
his
gun
and
bit
of
indoor
work
alone
,
while
she
stay
.
<EOS>
He
colour
up
at
the
news
,
and
cast
his
eye
over
his
hand
and
clothe
.
<EOS>
the
train
-
oil
and
gunpowder
be
shove
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
see
he
mean
to
give
her
his
company
;
and
I
guess
,
by
his
way
,
he
want
to
be
presentable
;
<EOS>
so
,
laugh
,
as
I
durst
not
laugh
when
the
master
be
by
,
I
offer
to
help
him
,
if
he
would
,
and
joke
at
his
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
grow
sullen
,
and
begin
to
swear
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
"
Zillah
go
on
,
see
me
not
pleased
by
her
manner
<EOS>
,
"
you
happen
think
your
young
lady
too
fine
for
Mr.
Hareton
;
and
happen
you
be
right
:
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
should
love
well
to
bring
her
pride
a
peg
lower
.
<EOS>
and
what
will
all
her
learning
and
her
daintiness
do
for
her
,
now
?
<EOS>
She
be
as
poor
as
you
or
I
:
<EOS>
poor
,
I
will
be
bind
:
you
be
say
,
and
I
be
do
my
little
all
that
road
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
allow
Zillah
to
give
him
her
aid
;
and
she
flatter
him
into
a
good
humour
;
so
,
when
Catherine
come
,
half
forget
her
former
insult
,
he
try
to
make
himself
agreeable
,
by
the
housekeeper
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
missis
walk
in
,
"
she
say
,
"
as
chill
as
an
icicle
,
and
as
high
as
a
princess
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
and
offer
her
my
seat
in
the
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
turn
up
her
nose
at
my
civility

<EOS>
Earnshaw
rise
,
too
,
and
bid
her
come
to
the
settle
,
and
sit
close
by
the
fire
:
he
be
sure
she
be
starve
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
have
be
starve
a
month
and
more
,
"
she
answer
,
rest
on
the
word
as
scornful
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
get
a
chair
for
herself
,
and
place
it
at
a
distance
from
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
have
sit
till
she
be
warm
,
she
begin
to
look
round
,
and
discover
a
number
of
book
on
the
dresser
;
she
be
instantly
upon
her
foot
again
,
stretch
to
reach
them
:
but
they
be
too
high
up
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
,
after
watch
her
endeavour
a
while
,
at
last
summon
courage
to
help
her
;
she
hold
her
frock
,
and
he
fill
it
with
the
first
that
come
to
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
great
advance
for
the
lad
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
thank
him
;
still
,
he
feel
gratified
that
she
have
accept
his
assistance
,
and
venture
to
stand
behind
as
she
examine
them
,
and
even
to
stoop
and
point
out
what
strike
his
fancy
in
certain
old
picture
which
they
contain
;
nor
be
he
daunt
by
the
saucy
style
in
which
she
jerk
the
page
from
his
finger
:
he
content
himself
with
go
a
bit
farther
back
and
look
at
her
instead
of
the
book
.
<EOS>
She
continue
read
,
or
seek
for
something
to
read
.
<EOS>
His
attention
become
,
by
degree
,
quite
centre
in
the
study
of
her
thick
silky
curl
:
<EOS>
her
face
he
could
not
see
,
and
she
could
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
not
quite
awake
to
what
he
do
,
but
attract
like
a
child
to
a
candle
,
at
last
he
proceed
from
stare
to
touch
;
he
put
out
his
hand
and
stroke
one
curl
,
as
gently
as
if
it
be
a
bird
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
stick
a
knife
into
her
neck
,
she
start
round
in
such
a
taking
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
get
away
this
moment
!
<EOS>
how
dare
you
touch
me
?
<EOS>
why
be

there

she
cry

in
a
tone
of
disgust

I
can
not

you

Mr.
Hareton
recoil
,
look
as
foolish
as
he
could
do
:
he
sit
down
in
the
settle
very
quiet
,
and
she
continue
turn
over
her
volume
another
half
hour
;
finally
,
Earnshaw
cross
over
,
and
whisper
to
me

Will

She
frown

look
up

"

Mrs.

I
never

I

more
than

kindle
up

I
ask
Mr.

to
let
me
wake
for
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
be
silent
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
out
of
door

anywhere

rather
than
have
your
disagreeable
voice
in
my
ear

say
my

"
Hareton
mutter
she
may
go
to
hell

for
him

<EOS>
and
unslinge
his
gun
,
restrain
himself
from
his
Sunday
occupation
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
talk
now
,
freely
enough
;
and
she
presently
see
fit
to
retreat
to
her
solitude
:
but
the
frost
have
set
in
,
and
,
in
spite
of
her
pride
,
she
be
force
to
condescend
to
our
company
,
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
take
care
<EOS>
there
should
be
no
further
scorning
at
my
good
nature
<EOS>
:
ever
since
,
I
have
be
as
stiff
as
herself
;
and
she
have
no
lover
or
liker
among
us
:
and
she
do
not
deserve
one
;
for
,
let
them
say
the
least
word
to
her
,
and
she
will
curl
back
without
respect
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
She
will
snap
at
the
master
himself
,
and
as
good
as
dare
him
to
thrash
her
;
and
the
more
hurt
she
get
,
the
more
venomous
she
grow
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
on
hear
this
account
from
Zillah
,
I
determine
to
leave
my
situation
,
take
a
cottage
,
and
get
Catherine
to
come
and
live
with
me
:
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
would
as
soon
permit
that
as
he
would
set
up
Hareton
in
an
independent
house
;
and
I
can
see
no
remedy
,
at
present
,
unless
she
could
marry
again
;
and
that
scheme
it
do
not
come
within
my
province
to
arrange
.
     
<EOS>
thus
end
Mrs.
Dean
's
story
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
doctor
's
prophecy
,
I
be
rapidly
recover
strength
;
and
though
it
be
only
the
second
week
in
January
,
I
propose
get
out
on
horseback
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
ride
over
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
to
inform
my
landlord
that
I
shall
spend
the
next
six
month
in
London
;
and
,
if
he
like
,
he
may
look
out
for
another
tenant
to
take
the
place
after
October
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
pass
another
winter
here
for
much
.
    
<EOS>
yesterday
be
bright
,
calm
,
and
frosty
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
Heights
as
I
propose
:
my
housekeeper
entreat
me
to
bear
a
little
note
from
her
to
her
young
lady
,
and
I
do
not
refuse
,
for
the
worthy
woman
be
not
conscious
of
anything
odd
in
her
request
.
<EOS>
the
front
door
stand
open
,
but
the
jealous
gate
be
fasten
,
as
at
my
last
visit
;
I
knock
and
invoke
Earnshaw
from
among
the
garden
-
bed
;
he
unchain
it
,
and
I
enter
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
as
handsome
a
rustic
as
need
be
see
.
<EOS>
I
take
particular
notice
of
him
this
time
;
but
then
he
do
his
good
apparently
to
make
the
least
of
his
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
if
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
at
home
?
<EOS>
He
answer
,
no
;
but
he
would
be
in
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
eleven
o'clock
,
and
I
announce
my
intention
of
go
in
and
wait
for
him
;
at
which
he
immediately
fling
down
his
tool
and
accompany
me
,
in
the
office
of
watchdog
,
not
as
a
substitute
for
the
host
.
  
<EOS>
We
enter
together
;
Catherine
be
there
,
make
herself
useful
in
prepare
some
vegetable
for
the
approach
meal
;
she
look
more
sulky
and
less
spirited
than
when
I
have
see
her
first
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
raise
her
eye
to
notice
me
,
and
continue
her
employment
with
the
same
disregard
to
common
form
of
politeness
as
before
;
never
return
my
bow
and
good
-
morning
by
the
slight
acknowledgment
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
seem
so
amiable
,
"
I
think
,
"
as
Mrs.
Dean
would
persuade
me
to
believe
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
beauty
,
it
be
true
;
but
not
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Earnshaw
surlily
bid
her
remove
her
thing
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
remove
them
yourself
,
"
she
say
,
push
them
from
her
as
soon
as
she
have
do
;
and
retire
to
a
stool
by
the
window
,
where
she
begin
to
carve
figure
of
bird
and
beast
out
of
the
turnip
-
paring
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
I
approach
her
,
pretend
to
desire
a
view
of
the
garden
;
and
,
as
I
fancy
,
adroitly
drop
Mrs.
Dean
's
note
on
to
her
knee
,
unnoticed
by
Hareton
 
<EOS>
but
she
ask
aloud
,
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
and
chuck
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
letter
from
your
old
acquaintance
,
the
housekeeper
at
the
Grange
,
"
I
answer
;
annoy
at
her
expose
my
kind
deed
,
and
fearful
lest
it
should
be
imagine
a
missive
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
She
would
gladly
have
gather
it
up
at
this
information
,
but
Hareton
beat
her
;
he
seize
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
,
say
Mr.
Heathcliff
should
look
at
it
first
.
<EOS>
thereat
,
Catherine
silently
turn
her
face
from
us
,
and
,
very
stealthily
,
draw
out
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
apply
it
to
her
eye
;
and
her
cousin
,
after
struggle
awhile
to
keep
down
his
soft
feeling
,
pull
out
the
letter
and
fling
it
on
the
floor
beside
her
,
as
ungraciously
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
Catherine
catch
and
peruse
it
eagerly
;
then
she
put
a
few
question
to
me
concern
the
inmate
,
rational
and
irrational
,
of
her
former
home
;
and
gaze
towards
the
hill
,
murmur
in
soliloquy
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
ride
Minny
down
there
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
climb
up
there
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
tired
 
<EOS>
I
be
_
stall
_
,
Hareton
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
lean
her
pretty
head
back
against
the
sill
,
with
half
a
yawn
and
half
a
sigh
,
and
lapse
into
an
aspect
of
abstract
sadness
:
neither
care
nor
know
whether
we
remark
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
say
,
after
sit
some
time
mute

you
be
not
aware
that
I
be
an
acquaintance
of
yours

<EOS>
so
intimate
that
I
think
it
strange
<EOS>
you
will
not
come
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
housekeeper
never
weary
of
talk
about
and
praise
you
;
and
she
will
be
greatly
disappointed
if
I
return
with
no
news
of
or
from
you
,
except
that
you
receive
her
letter
and
say
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
appear
to
wonder
at
this
speech
,
and
ask
,
    
"
do
Ellen
like
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
well
,

I
reply
,
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
tell
her
,
"
she
continue
,
"
that
I
would
answer
her
letter
,
but
I
have
no
material
for
writing
:
not
even
a
book
from
which
I
may
tear
a
leaf
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
book
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
contrive
to
live
here
without
them
?
<EOS>
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
though
provide
with
a
large
library
,
I
be
frequently
very
dull
at
the
grange
;
take
my
book
away
,
and
I
should
be
desperate
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
always
read
,
when
I
have
them
,
"
say
Catherine
;
"
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
never
read
;
so
he
take
it
into
his
head
to
destroy
my
book
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
a
glimpse
of
one
for
week
.
<EOS>
only
once
,
I
search
through
Joseph
's
store
of
theology
,
to
his
great
irritation
;
and
once
,
Hareton
,
I
come
upon
a
secret
stock
in
your
room
 
<EOS>
some
latin
and
Greek
,
and
some
tale
and
poetry
:
<EOS>
all
old
friend
.
<EOS>
I
bring
the
last
here
 
<EOS>
and
you
gather
them
,
as
a
magpie
gather
silver
spoon
,
for
the
mere
love
of
steal
!
<EOS>
They
be
of
no
use
to
you
;
or
else
you
conceal
them
in
the
bad
spirit
that
,
as
you
can
not
enjoy
them
,
nobody
else
shall
.
<EOS>
perhaps
_
your
_
envy
counsel
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
rob
me
of
my
treasure
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
most
of
them
write
on
my
brain
and
print
in
my
heart
,
and
you
can
not
deprive
me
of
those
!

<EOS>
Earnshaw
blush
crimson
when
his
cousin
make
this
revelation
of
his
private
literary
accumulation
,
and
stammer
an
indignant
denial
of
her
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hareton
be
desirous

increase
his
amount

knowledge

come
to

<EOS>
He
be
not
_
envious

emulous

of
your
attainment

<EOS>
He
will
be
a
clever
scholar
in
a
few
year

"
  
<EOS>

he
want
me
to
sink

Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
hear
him
try
to
spell
and
read
to
himself
,

pretty
blunder
he
make
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
repeat
Chevy
Chase
as
you
do
yesterday
:
it
be
extremely
funny
.
<EOS>
I
hear
you
;
and
I
hear
you
turn
over
the
dictionary
to
seek
out
the
hard
word
,
and
then
curse
because
you
could
not
read
their
explanation
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
young
man
evidently
think
it
too
bad
that
he
should
be
laugh
at
for
his
ignorance
,
and
then
laugh
at
for
try
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
similar
notion
;
and
,
remember
Mrs.
Dean
's
anecdote
of
his
first
attempt
at
enlighten
the
darkness
in
which
he
have
be
rear
,
I
observe
,
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
we
have
each
have
a
commencement
,
and
each
stumbled
and
totter
on
the
threshold
;
have
our
teacher
scorn
instead
of
aid
us
,
we
should
stumble
and
totter
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
<EOS>
she
reply
,
"
I
do
not
wish
to
limit
his
acquirement
:
still
,
he
have
no
right
to
appropriate
what
be
mine
,
and
make
it
ridiculous
to
me
with
his
vile
mistake
and
mispronunciation
!
<EOS>
those
book
,
both
prose
and
verse
,
be
consecrate
to
me
by
other
association
;
and
I
hate
to
have
them
debase
and
profane
in
his
mouth
!
<EOS>
besides
,
of
all
,
he
have
select
my
favourite
piece
that
I
love
the
most
to
repeat
,
as
if
out
of
deliberate
malice
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hareton
's
chest
heave
in
silence
a
minute
<EOS>
:
he
labour
under
a
severe
sense
of
mortification
and
wrath
,
which
it
be
no
easy
task
to
suppress
.
<EOS>
I
rise
,
and
,
from
a
gentlemanly
idea
of
relieve
his
embarrassment
,
take
up
my
station
in
the
doorway
,
survey
the
external
prospect
as
I
stand
.
<EOS>
He
follow
my
example
,
and
leave
the
room
;
but
presently
reappear
,
bear
half
a
dozen
volume
in
his
hand
,
which
he
throw
into
Catherine
's
lap
,
exclaim
<EOS>
,
 
"
take
them
!
<EOS>
I
never
want
to
hear
,

think
of
them
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
them
now

she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
connect
them
with
you

hate
them

"
  
<EOS>
She
open
one
that
have
obviously
be
often
turn
over
,
and
read
a
portion
in
the
drawl
tone
of
a
beginner
;
then
laugh
,
and
throw
it
from
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
listen
,
"
she
continue
,
provokingly
,
commence
a
verse
of
an
old
ballad
in
the
same
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
self
-
love
would
endure
no
further
torment
:
<EOS>
I
hear
,
and
not
altogether
disapprovingly
,
a
manual
check
give
to
her
saucy
tongue
.
<EOS>
the
little
wretch
have
do
her
utmost
to
hurt
her
cousin
's
sensitive
though
uncultivated
feeling
,
and
a
physical
argument
be
the
only
mode
he
have
of
balance
the
account
,
and
repay
its
effect
on
the
inflictor
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
gather
the
book
and
hurl
them
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
read
in
his
countenance
what
anguish
it
be
to
offer
that
sacrifice
to
spleen
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
that
as
they
consume
,
he
recall
the
pleasure
they
have
already
impart
,
and
the
triumph
and
ever
-
increase
pleasure
he
have
anticipate
from
them
;
and
I
fancy
I
guess
the
incitement
to
his
secret
study
also
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
content
with
daily
labour
and
rough
animal
enjoyment
,
till
Catherine
cross
his
path
.
<EOS>
shame
at
her
scorn
,
and
hope
of
her
approval
,
be
his
first
prompter
to
high
pursuit
;
and
instead
of
guard
him
from
one
and
win
him
to
the
other
,
his
endeavour
to
raise
himself
have
produce
just
the
contrary
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
that
be
all
the
good
that
such
a
brute
as
you
can
get
from
them
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Catherine
,
suck
her
damage
lip
,
and
watch
the
conflagration
with
indignant
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
<EOS>
_
better
<EOS>
_
hold
your
tongue
,
now
<EOS>
,
"
he
answer
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
and
his
agitation
preclude
further
speech
;
he
advance
hastily
to
the
entrance
,
where
I
make
way
for
him
to
pass
.
<EOS>
but
ere
he
have
cross
the
door
-
stone
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
come
up
the
causeway
,
encounter
him
,
and
lay
hold
of
his
shoulder
ask
,
 
"
what
be
to
do
now
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
naught
,
naught
,
"
he
say
,
and
break
away
to
enjoy
his
grief
and
anger
in
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
Heathcliff
gaze
after
him
,
and
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
odd
if
I
thwart
myself
,
"
he
mutter
,
unconscious
that
I
be
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
when
I
look
for
his
father
in
his
face
,
I
find
_
her
_
every
day
more
!
<EOS>
how
the
devil
be
he
so
like
?
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
bear
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
bend
his
eye
to
the
ground
,
and
walk
moodily
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
restless
,
anxious
expression
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
remark
there
before
;
and
he
look
sparer
in
person
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
on
perceive
him
through
the
window
,
immediately
escape
to
the
kitchen
,
so
that
I
remain
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
out
of
door
again
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
"
he
say
,
in
reply
to
my
greeting
;
"
from
selfish
motive
partly
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
could
readily
supply
your
loss
in
this
desolation
.
<EOS>
I
have
wonder
more
than
once
what
bring
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
an
idle
whim
,
I
fear
,
<EOS>
sir
,
"
be
my
answer
;
"
or
else
an
idle
whim
be
go
to
spirit
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
shall
set
out
for
London
next
week
;
and
I
must
give
you
warn
that
I
feel
no
disposition
to
retain
Thrushcross
Grange
beyond
the
twelve
month
I
agree
to
rent
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
not
live
there
any
more

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
indeed
;
you
be
tired
of
be
banish
from
the
world
,
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
be
come
to
plead
off
pay
for
a
place
you
will
not
occupy
,
your
journey
be
useless

I
never
relent
in
exact
my
due
from
any
one

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
plead
off
nothing

it

I
exclaim

considerably
irritated

"
<EOS>
Should
you
wish
it
,
I
will
settle
with
you
now

I
draw
my
note

book
from
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

he
reply
,
coolly
;
"
you
will
leave
sufficient
behind
to
cover
your
debt

if
you
fail
to
return

I
be
not
in
such
a
hurry

<EOS>
sit
down
and
take
your
dinner
with
us

guest
that
be
safe
from
repeat
his
visit
can
generally
be
make
welcome

Catherine
!

bring
the
thing
in

:
where

<EOS>
Catherine
reappear
,
bear
a
tray
of
knife
and
fork
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
get
your
dinner
with
Joseph

mutter
Heathcliff
,
aside
,

remain
in
the
kitchen
till
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
obey
his
direction
very
punctually
:
perhaps
she
have
no
temptation
to
transgress
.
<EOS>
live
among
clown
and
misanthropist
,
she
probably
can
not
appreciate
a
well
class
of
people
when
she
meet
them

<EOS>
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
grim
and
saturnine
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Hareton
,
absolutely
dumb
,
on
the
other
,
I
make
a
somewhat
cheerless
meal
,
and
bade
adieu
early
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
depart
by
the
back
way
,
to
get
a
last
glimpse
of
Catherine
and
annoy
old
Joseph
;
but
Hareton
receive
order
to
lead
up
my
horse
,
and
my
host
himself
escort
me
to
the
door

I
could
not
fulfil

how
dreary
life
get
over

house

reflect
,
while
ride
down
the
road

what
a
realisation

more
romantic

fairy
tale
it
would
have
be

Linton

strike
up

1802
.
 
<EOS>
this
September
I
be
invite
to
devastate
the
moor
of
a
friend
in
the
north
,
and
on
my
journey
to
his
abode
,
I
unexpectedly
come
within
fifteen
mile
of
Gimmerton
.
<EOS>
the
ostler
at
a
roadside
public
-
house
be
hold
a
pail
of
water
to
refresh
my
horse
,
when
a
cart
of
very
green
oat
,
newly
reap
,
pass
by
,
and
he
remark
,
 
"
Yon

They
be

after

<EOS>
"
Gimmerton
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
 
my
residence
in
that
locality
have
already
grow
dim
and
dreamy

"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
.
<EOS>
how
far
be
it
from
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
happen
fourteen
mile
o'er
th
'
 
hill
;
and
a
rough
road
,
"
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
a
sudden
impulse
seize
me
to
visit
Thrushcross
Grange
.
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
noon
,
and
I
conceive
that
I
may
as
well
pass
the
night
under
my
own
roof
as
in
an
inn
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
could
spare
a
day
easily
to
arrange
matter
with
my
landlord
,
and
thus
save
myself
the
trouble
of
invade
the
neighbourhood
again
.
<EOS>
have
rest
awhile
,
I
direct
my
servant
to
inquire
the
way
to
the
village
;
and
,
with
great
fatigue
to
our
beast
,
we
manage
the
distance
in
some
three
hour
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
him
there
,
and
proceed
down
the
valley
alone
.
<EOS>
the
grey
church
look
greyer
,
and
the
lonely
churchyard
lonelier
.
<EOS>
I
distinguish
a
moor
-
sheep
crop
the
short
turf
on
the
grave
.
<EOS>
It
be
sweet
,
warm
weather
 
too
warm
for
travel
;
but
the
heat
do
not
hinder
me
from
enjoy
the
delightful
scenery
above
and
below
:
have
I
see
it
near
August
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
it
would
have
tempt
me
to
waste
a
month
among
its
solitude
.
<EOS>
in
winter
nothing
more
dreary
,
in
summer
nothing
more
divine
,
than
those
glen
shut
in
by
hill
,
and
those
bluff
,
bold
swell
of
heath
.
  
<EOS>
I
reach
the
Grange
before
sunset
,
and
knock
for
admittance
;
but
the
family
have
retreat
into
the
back
premise
,
I
judge
,
by
one
thin
,
blue
wreath
,
curl
from
the
kitchen
chimney
,
and
they
do
not
hear
.
<EOS>
I
ride
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
under
the
porch
,
a
girl
of
nine
or
ten
sit
knit
,
and
an
old
woman
recline
on
the
housestep
,
smoke
a
meditative
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mrs.
Dean

I
demand
of

she

<EOS>
She
throw
down
her
pipe
and
bustle
in
,
the
girl
follow
,
and
I
enter
too
;
soon
perceive
that
her
report
be
true
,
and
,
moreover
,
that
I
have
almost
upset
her
wit
by
my
unwelcome
apparition
,
I
bid
her
be
compose
.
<EOS>
I
would
go
out
for
a
walk
;
and
,
meantime
she
must
try
to
prepare
a
corner
of
a
sit
-
room
for
me
to
sup
in
,
and
a
bedroom
to
sleep
in
.
<EOS>
no
sweep
and
dusting
,
only
good
fire
and
dry
sheet
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
seem
willing
to
do
her
good
;
though
she
thrust
the
hearth
-
brush
into
the
grate
in
mistake
for
the
poker
,
and
malappropriate
several
other
article
of
her
craft
:
but
I
retire
,
confide
in
her
energy
for
a
rest
-
place
against
my
return
.
<EOS>
Wuthering
Heights
be
the
goal
of
my
propose
excursion
.
<EOS>
an
afterthought
bring
me
back
,
when
I
have
quit
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
well
at
the
Heights
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
of
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eea

f'r
owt

knaw

"
<EOS>
she
answer
,
skurrye
away
with
a
pan
of
hot
cinder
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
ask
why
Mrs.
Dean
have
desert
the
grange
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
delay
her
at
such
a
crisis
,
so
I
turn
away
and
make
my
exit
,
ramble
leisurely
along
,
with
the
glow
of
a
sink
sun
behind
,
and
the
mild
glory
of
a
rise
moon
in
front
 
one
fading
,
and
the
other
brightening
 
as
I
quit
the
park
,
and
climb
the
stony
by
-
road
branching
off
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
before
I
arrive
in
sight
of
it
,
all
that
remain
of
day
be
a
beamless
amber
light
along
the
west
:
but
I
could
see
every
pebble
on
the
path
,
and
every
blade
of
grass
,
by
that
splendid
moon
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
to
climb
the
gate
nor
to
knock
 
<EOS>
it
yield
to
my
hand
.
<EOS>
that
be
an
improvement
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
and
I
notice
another
,
by
the
aid
of
my
nostril
;
a
fragrance
of
stock
and
wallflower
waft
on
the
air
from
amongst
the
homely
fruit
-
tree
.
  
<EOS>
both
door
and
lattice
be
open
;
and
yet
,
as
be
usually
the
case
in
a
coal
-
district
,
a
fine
red
fire
illumine
the
chimney
:
the
comfort
which
the
eye
derive
from
it
render
the
extra
heat
endurable
.
<EOS>
but
the
house
of
Wuthering
Heights
be
so
large
that
the
inmate
have
plenty
of
space
for
withdraw
out
of
its
influence
;
and
accordingly
what
inmate
there
be
have
station
themselves
not
far
from
one
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
could
both
see
them
and
hear
them
talk
before
I
enter
,
and
look
and
listen
in
consequence
;
be
move
thereto
by
a
mingled
sense
of
curiosity
and
envy
,
that
grow
as
I
linger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Con-_trary

"
say
a
voice
as
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
.

I

I
will
pull
your

"
  
<EOS>
"
Contrary
,
then
,
"
answer
another
,
in
deep
but
softened
tone
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
kiss
me
,
for
minding
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
read
it
over
first
correctly
,
without
a
single
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
male
speaker
begin
to
read
:
he
be
a
young
man
,
respectably
dress
and
seat
at
a
table
,
have
a
book
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
handsome
feature
glow
with
pleasure
,
and
his
eye
keep
impatiently
wander
from
the
page
to
a
small
white
hand
over
his
shoulder
,
which
recall
him
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
cheek
,
whenever
its
owner
detect
such
sign
of
inattention
.
<EOS>
Its
owner
stand
behind
;
her
light
,
shine
ringlet
blend
,
at
interval
,
with
his
brown
look
,
as
she
bend
to
superintend
his
study
;
and
her
face
 
<EOS>
it
be
lucky
he
could
not
see
her
face
,
or
he
would
never
have
be
so
steady
.
<EOS>
I
could
;
<EOS>
and
I
bite
my
lip
in
spite
,
at
have
throw
away
the
chance
I
may
have
have
of
do
something
besides
stare
at
its
smiting
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
the
task
be
do
,
not
free
from
further
blunder
;
but
the
pupil
claim
a
reward
,
and
receive
at
least
five
kiss
;
which
,
however
,
he
generously
return
.
<EOS>
then
they
come
to
the
door
,
and
from
their
conversation
I
judge
they
be
about
to
issue
out
and
have
a
walk
on
the
moor
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
should
be
condemn
in
Hareton
Earnshaw
's
heart
,
if
not
by
his
mouth
,
to
the
low
pit
in
the
infernal
region
<EOS>
if
I
show
my
unfortunate
person
in
his
neighbourhood
then
;
and
feel
very
mean
and
malignant
,
I
skulk
round
to
seek
refuge
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
there
be
unobstructed
admittance
on
that
side
also
;
and
at
the
door
sit
my
old
friend
nelly
Dean
,
sewing
and
singe
a
song
;
which
be
often
interrupt
from
within
by
harsh
word
of
scorn

intolerance

utter
in

no

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
She
hasten
to
fetch
it
before
I
could

I
hear
Joseph
ask
whether

it
warn't
a

scandal

a

and
afterwards

with
the
sequel

<EOS>
He
have
a

end

it

<EOS>
I
be
summon
to
Wuthering
Heights

within
a
fortnight
of
your

;

I
obey
joyfully
,
for
Catherine
's
sake

<EOS>
My
first
interview
with
her
grieved
and
shock
me
<EOS>
:
she
have
alter
so
much
since
our
separation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
do
not
explain
his
reason
for
take
a
new
mind
about
my
coming
here
;
he
only
tell
me
he
want
me
,
and
he
be
tired
of
see
catherine
<EOS>
:
I
must
make
the
little
parlour
my
sitting
-
room
,
and
keep
her
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
if
he
be
oblige
to
see
her
once
or
twice
a
day
.
<EOS>
She
seem
pleased
at
this
arrangement
;
and
,
by
degree
,
I
smuggle
over
a
great
number
of
book
,
and
other
article
,
that
have
form
her
amusement
at
the
grange
;
and
flatter
myself
we
should
get
on
in
tolerable
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
delusion
do
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
content
at
first
,
in
a
brief
space
grow
irritable
and
restless
.
<EOS>
for
one
thing
,
she
be
forbid
to
move
out
of
the
garden
,
and
it
fret
her
sadly
to
be
confine
to
its
narrow
bound
as
spring
draw
on
;
for
another
,
in
follow
the
house
,
I
be
force
to
quit
her
frequently
,
and
she
complain
of
loneliness
<EOS>
:
she
prefer
quarrel
with
Joseph
in
the
kitchen
to
sit
at
peace
in
her
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
their
skirmish
:
but
Hareton
be
often
oblige
to
seek
the
kitchen
also
,
when
the
master
want
to
have
the
house
to
himself
!
<EOS>
and
though
in
the
beginning
she
either
leave
it
at
his
approach
,
or
quietly
join
in
my
occupation
,
and
shun
remark
or
address
him
 
and
though
he
be
always
as
sullen
and
silent
as
possible
 
after
a
while
,
she
change
her
behaviour
,
and
become
incapable
of
let
him
alone
:
talk
at
him
;
comment
on
his
stupidity
and
idleness
;
express
her
wonder
how
he
could
endure
the
life
he
live
 
how
he
could
sit
a
whole
evening
stare
into
the
fire
,
and
dozing
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
just
like
a
dog

be
he
not

Ellen

"
<EOS>
she
once
observe
,
"
or
a
cart

horse
?
<EOS>
He
do
his
work
,
eat
his
food
,
and
sleep
eternally
!
<EOS>
what
a
blank
,
dreary
mind
he
must
have
!
<EOS>
do
you
ever
dream
,
Hareton
?
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
do
,
what
be
it
about
?
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
speak
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
look
at
him
;
but
he
would
neither
open
his
mouth
nor
look
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
,
perhaps
,
dream
now

"
she
continue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
twitch
his
shoulder
as
Juno
twitch
hers
.
<EOS>
ask
him
,
Ellen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Hareton
will
ask
the
master
to
send
you
up

stair
,
if
you
do
not
behave

I
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
only
twitch
his
shoulder
but
clench
his
fist
,
as
if
tempt
to
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
why
Hareton
never
speak
,
when
I
be
in
the
kitchen
,
"
she
exclaim
,
on
another
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
I
shall
laugh
at
him
.
<EOS>
Ellen
,
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
He
begin
to
teach
himself
to
read
once
;
and
,
because
I
laugh
,
he
burn
his
book
,
and
drop
it
:
be
he
not
a
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
you
naughty
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
;
"
answer
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be
,
"
she
go
on
;
"
but
I
do
not
expect
him
to
be
so
silly
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
if
I
give
you
a
book
,
would
you
take
it
now
?
<EOS>
I
will
try
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
place
one
she
have
be
peruse
on
his
hand
;
he
fling
it
off
,
and
mutter
,
if
she
do
not
give
over
,
he
would
break
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
shall
put
it
here
,
"
she
say
,
"
in
the
table
-
drawer
;
and
I
be
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
whisper
me
to
watch
whether
he
touch
it
,
and
depart
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
come
near
it
;
and
so
I
inform
her
in
the
morning
,
to
her
great
disappointment
.
<EOS>
I
see
she
be
sorry
for
his
persevere
sulkiness
and
indolence
:
her
conscience
reprove
her
for
frighten
him
off
improve
himself
:
she
have
do
it
effectually
.
<EOS>
but
her
ingenuity
be
at
work
to
remedy
the
injury
:
while
I
iron
,
or
pursue
other
such
stationary
employment
as
I
could
not
well
do
in
the
parlour
,
she
would
bring
some
pleasant
volume
and
read
it
aloud
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
Hareton
be
there
,
she
generally
pause
in
an
interesting
part
,
and
leave
the
book
lie
about
:
that
she
do
repeatedly
;
but
he
be
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
,
and
,
instead
of
snatch
at
her
bait
,
in
wet
weather
he
take
to
smoking
with
Joseph
;
and
they
sit
like
automaton
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
,
the
eld
happily
too
deaf
to
understand
her
wicked
nonsense
,
as
he
would
have
call
it
,
the
young
do
his
good
to
seem
to
disregard
it
.
<EOS>
on
fine
evening
the
latter
follow
his
shooting
expedition
,
and
Catherine
yawn
and
sigh
,
and
tease
me
to
talk
to
her
,
and
run
off
into
the
court
or
garden
the
moment
I
begin
;
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
cry
,
and
say
she
be
tired
of
live
:
her
life
be
useless
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
grow
more
and
more
disinclined
to
society
,
have
almost
banish
Earnshaw
from
his
apartment
.
<EOS>
owe
to
an
accident
at
the
commencement
of
March
,
he
become
for
some
day
a
fixture
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
His
gun
burst
while
out
on
the
hill
by
himself
;
a
splinter
cut
his
arm
,
and
he
lose
a
good
deal
of
blood
before
he
could
reach
home
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
that
,
perforce
,
he
be
condemn
to
the
fireside
and
tranquillity
,
till
he
make
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
It
suit
Catherine
to
have
him
there
:
at
any
rate
,
it
make
her
hate
her
room
up
-
stair
more
than
ever
:
and
she
would
compel
me
to
find
out
business
below
,
that
she
may
accompany
me
.
  
<EOS>
on
Easter
Monday
,
Joseph
go
to
Gimmerton
fair
with
some
cattle
;
and
,
in
the
afternoon
,
I
be
busy
get
up
linen
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
sit
,
morose
as
usual
,
at
the
chimney
corner
,
and
my
little
mistress
be
beguile
an
idle
hour
with
drawing
picture
on
the
window
-
pane
,
vary
her
amusement
by
smothered
burst
of
song
,
and
whisper
ejaculation
,
and
quick
glance
of
annoyance
and
impatience
in
the
direction
of
her
cousin
,
who
steadfastly
smoke
,
and
look
into
the
grate
.
<EOS>
at
a
notice
that
I
could
do
with
her
no
longer
intercept
my
light
,
she
remove
to
the
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
I
bestow
little
attention
on
her
proceeding
,
but
,
presently
,
I
hear
her
begin
 
<EOS>
"

he

with
uncompromising

<EOS>
"
let

she
say
,
cautiously
advance
her
hand
and
abstract
it
from
his
mouth

<EOS>
before
he
could
attempt
to
recover
it
,
it
be
break
,
and
behind
the
fire

<EOS>
He
swear
at

seize
another

"

chew
her

by
hum
an
eccentric

You

It

what

<EOS>
She
return
to
the
hearth
,
and
frankly
extend
her
hand

<EOS>
He
blacken
and
scowl
like
a
thunder

cloud
,
and
keep
his
fist
resolutely
clench
,
and
his
gaze
fix
on
the
ground

<EOS>
Catherine
,
by
instinct
,
must
have
divine
it
be
obdurate
perversity
,
and
not
dislike
,
that
prompt
this
dogged
conduct
;
for
,
after
remain
an
instant
undecided
,
she
stoop
and
impress
on
his
cheek
a
gentle
kiss
.
<EOS>
the
little
rogue
think
I
have
not
see
her
,
and
,
draw
back
<EOS>
,
she
take
her
former
station
by
the
window
,
quite
demurely
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
reprovingly
,
and
then
she
blush
and
whisper
 
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
what
should
I
have
do
,
Ellen
?
<EOS>
He
would
not
shake
hand
,
and
he
would
not
look
:
<EOS>
I
must
show
him
some
way
that
I
like
him
 
that
I
want
to
be
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
whether
the
kiss
convince
Hareton
,
I
can
not
tell
:
<EOS>
he
be
very
careful
,
for
some
minute
,
that
his
face
should
not
be
see
,
and
when
he
do
raise
it
,
he
be
sadly
puzzle
where
to
turn
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
employ
herself
in
wrap
a
handsome
book
neatly
in
white
paper
,
and
have
tie
it
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
,
and
address
it
to
"
Mr.
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
"
she
desire
me
to
be
her
ambassadress
,
and
convey
the
present
to
its
destine
recipient

<EOS>
"
and
tell
him
,
if
he
will
take
it
,
I
will
come
and
teach
him
to
read
it
right
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
,
if
he
refuse
it
,
I
will
go
upstairs
,
and
never
tease
him
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
carry
it
,
and
repeat
the
message
;
anxiously
watch
by
my
employer
.
<EOS>
Hareton
would
not
open
his
finger
,
so
I
lay
it
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
strike
it
off
,
either
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
work
.
<EOS>
Catherine
lean
her
head
and
arm
on
the
table
,
till
she
hear
the
slight
rustle
of
the
covering
be
remove
;
then
she
steal
away
,
and
quietly
seat
herself
beside
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
tremble
,
and
his
face
glow
:
<EOS>
all
his
rudeness
and
all
his
surly
harshness
have
desert
him
:
<EOS>
he
could
not
summon
courage
,
at
first
,
to
utter
a
syllable
in
reply
to
her
questioning
look
,
and
her
murmur
petition
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
you
forgive
me
,
Hareton
,
do
.
<EOS>
You
can
make
me
so
happy
by
speak
that
little
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
mutter
something
inaudible
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
be
my
friend
?
"
<EOS>
add
Catherine
,
interrogatively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
will
be
ashamed
of
me
every
day
of
your
life
,
"
he
answer
;
"
and
the
more
ashamed
,
the
more
you
know
me
;
and
I
can
not
bide
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
will
not
be
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
smile
as
sweet
as
honey
,
and
creep
close
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
overhear
no
further
distinguishable
talk
,
but
,
on
look
round
again
,
I
perceive
two
such
radiant
countenance
bent
over
the
page
of
the
accept
book
,
that
I
do
not
doubt
the
treaty
have
be
ratify
on
both
side
;
and
the
enemy
be
,
thenceforth
,
swear
ally
.
  
<EOS>
the
work
they
study
be
full
of
costly
picture
;
and
those
and
their
position
have
charm
enough
to
keep
them
unmoved
till
Joseph
come
home
.
<EOS>
He
,
poor
man
,
be
perfectly
aghast
at
the
spectacle
of
Catherine
seat
on
the
same
bench
with
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
lean
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
;
and
confound
at
his
favourite
's
endurance
of
her
proximity
:
it
affect
him
too
deeply
to
allow
an
observation
on
the
subject
that
night
.
<EOS>
His
emotion
be
only
reveal
by
the
immense
sigh
he
draw
,
as
he
solemnly
spread
his
large
Bible
on
the
table
,
and
overlay
it
with
dirty
bank
-
note
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
the
produce
of
the
day
's
transaction
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
summon
Hareton
from
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tak

he

,
"
and

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
It
be
not

o'clock

"
<EOS>
she
answer
,
rise
unwillingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hareton
,
I
will
leave
this
book
upon

"
  
<EOS>
Cathy
threaten
that
his
library
should
pay
for
her
;
and
,
smile
as
she
pass
Hareton
,
go
singe
up
-
stair
:
light
of
heart
,
I
venture
to
say
,
than
ever
she
have
be
under
that
roof
before
;
except
,
perhaps
,
during
her
early
visit
to
Linton
.
  
<EOS>
the
intimacy
thus
commence
grow
rapidly
;
though
it
encounter
temporary
interruption
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
be
not
to
be
civilized
with
a
wish
,
and
my
young
lady
be
no
philosopher
,
and
no
paragon
of
patience
;
but
both
their
mind
tend
to
the
same
point
 
one
loving
and
desire
to
esteem
,
and
the
other
loving
and
desire
to
be
esteem
 
they
contrive
in
the
end
to
reach
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
it
be
easy
enough
to
win
Mrs.
Heathcliff
's
heart
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
I
be
glad
you
do
not
try
.
<EOS>
the
crown
of
all
my
wish
will
be
the
union
of
those
two
.
<EOS>
I
shall
envy
no
one
on
their
wedding
day
:
there
will
not
be
a
happy
woman
than
myself
in
England
!
    
<EOS>
on
the
morrow
of
that
Monday
,
Earnshaw
be
still
unable
to
follow
his
ordinary
employment
,
and
therefore
remain
about
the
house
,
I
speedily
find
it
would
be
impracticable
to
retain
my
charge
beside
me
,
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
She
get
downstairs
before
me
,
and
out
into
the
garden
,
where
she
have
see
her
cousin
perform
some
easy
work
;
and
when
I
go
to
bid
them
come
to
breakfast
<EOS>
,
I
see
she
have
persuade
him
to
clear
a
large
space
of
ground
from
currant
and
gooseberry
bush
,
and
they
be
busy
plan
together
an
importation
of
plant
from
the
Grange
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
terrify
at
the
devastation
which
have
be
accomplish
in
a
brief
half
-
hour
;
the
black
-
currant
tree
be
the
apple
of
Joseph
's
eye
,
and
she
have
just
fix
her
choice
of
a
flower
-
bed
in
the
midst
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
!
<EOS>
that
will
be
all
show
to
the
master
,
"
I
exclaim
,
"
the
minute
it
be
discover
.
<EOS>
and
what
excuse
have
you
to
offer
for
take
such
liberty
with
the
garden
?
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
fine
explosion
on
the
head
of
it
:
see
if
we
do
not
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Hareton
,
I
wonder
you
should
have
no
more
wit
than
to
go
and
make
that
mess
at
her
bidding
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
forget
they
be
Joseph
's
,
"
answer
Earnshaw
,
rather
puzzle
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
will
tell
him
I
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
always
eat
our
meal
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
I
hold
the
mistress
's
post
in
make
tea
and
carving
;
so
I
be
indispensable
at
table
.
<EOS>
Catherine
usually
sit
by
me
,
but
to
-
day
she
steal
nearer
to
Hareton
;
and
I
presently
see
she
would
have
no
more
discretion
in
her
friendship
than
she
have
in
her
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
mind
you
do
not
talk
with
and
notice
your
cousin
too
much
,
"
be
my
whispered
instruction
as
we
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
certainly
annoy
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
will
be
mad
at
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
the
minute
after
,
she
have
sidle
to
him
,
and
be
stick
primrose
in
his
plate
of
porridge
.
  
<EOS>
He
dare
not
speak
to
her
there
:
he
dare
hardly
look
;
and
yet
she
go
on
teasing
,
till
he
be
twice
on
the
point
of
be
provoke
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
I
frown
,
and
then
she
glance
towards
the
master
:
whose
mind
be
occupy
on
other
subject
than
his
company
,
as
his
countenance
evince
;
and
she
grow
serious
for
an
instant
,
scrutinize
him
with
deep
gravity
.
<EOS>
afterwards
she
turn
,
and
recommence
her
nonsense
;
at
last
,
Hareton
utter
a
smothered
laugh
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
start
;
his
eye
rapidly
survey
our
face
,
Catherine
meet
it
with
her
accustomed
look
of
nervousness
and
yet
defiance
,
which
he
abhor
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
you
be
out
of
my
reach
,
"
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
what
fiend
possess
you
to
stare
back
at
me
,
continually
,
with
those
infernal
eye
?
<EOS>
down
with
them
!
<EOS>
and
do
not
remind
me
of
your
existence
again
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
cure
you
of
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
me

"
mutter
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
?
"
demand
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
Hareton
look
at
his
plate
,
and
do
not
repeat
the
confession
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
look
at
him
a
bit
,
and
then
silently
resume
his
breakfast
and
his
interrupt
musing
.
<EOS>
We
have
nearly
finish
,
and
the
two
young
people
prudently
shift
wider
asunder
,
so
I
anticipate
no
further
disturbance
during
that
sit
:
when
Joseph
appear
at
the
door
,
reveal
by
his
quivering
lip
and
furious
eye
that
the
outrage
commit
on
his
precious
shrub
be
detect
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
see
Cathy
and
her
cousin
about
the
spot
before
he
examine
it
,
for
while
his
jaw
work
like
those
of
a
cow
chew
its
cud
,
and
render
his
speech
difficult
to
understand

he

outright

the

reproachfully

will
not

have
do

come

whisper
earnestly

It
be

late

Heathcliff
have
catch
hold
of

"
now
,
_
you
_
go

he

accurse

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
He
have
his
hand
in
her
hair
;
Hareton
attempt
to
release
her
lock
,
entreat
him
not
to
hurt
her
that
once
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
's
black
eye
flash
;
he
seem
ready
to
tear
Catherine
in
piece
,
and
I
be
just
work
up
to
risk
come
to
the
rescue
,
when
of
a
sudden
his
finger
relax
;
he
shift
his
grasp
from
her
head
to
her
arm
,
and
gaze
intently
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
then
he
draw
his
hand
over
his
eye
,
stand
a
moment
to
collect
himself
apparently
,
and
turn
anew
to
Catherine
,
say
,
with
assumed
calmness
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
learn
to
avoid
put
me
in
a
passion
,
or
I
shall
really
murder
you
some
time

<EOS>
go
with
Mrs.
Dean
,
and
keep
with
her
;
and
confine
your
insolence
to
her
ear

<EOS>
as
to
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
if
I
see
him
listen
to
you
,
I
will
send
him
seek
his
bread
where
he
can
get
it
!
<EOS>
Your
love
will
make
him
an
outcast
and
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
nelly
,
take
her
;
and
leave
me
,
all
of
you
!
<EOS>
leave
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
lead
my
young
lady
out
:
<EOS>
she
be
too
glad
of
her
escape
to
resist
;
the
other
follow
,
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
have
the
room
to
himself
till
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
have
counsel
Catherine
to
dine
up
-
stair
;
but
,
as
soon
as
he
perceive
her
vacant
seat
,
he
send
me
to
call
her
.
<EOS>
He
speak
to
none
of
us
,
eat
very
little
,
and
go
out
directly
afterwards
,
intimate
that
he
should
not
return
before
evening
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
new
friend
establish
themselves
in
the
house
during
his
absence
;
where
I
hear
Hareton
sternly
check
his
cousin
,
on
her
offer
a
revelation
of
her
father
-
in
-
law
's
conduct
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
not
suffer
a
word
to
be
utter
in
his
disparagement
:
if
he
be
the
devil
,
it
do
not
signify
;
he
would
stand
by
him
;
and
he
would
rather
she
would
abuse
himself
,
as
she
use
to
,
than
begin
on
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
<EOS>
Catherine
be
wax
cross
at
this
;
but
he
find
mean
to
make
her
hold
her
tongue
,
by
ask
how
she
would
like
_
him
_
to
speak
ill
of
her
father
?
<EOS>
then
she
comprehend
that
Earnshaw
take
the
master
's
reputation
home
to
himself
;
and
be
attach
by
tie
strong
than
reason
could
break
 
chain
,
forge
by
habit
,
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
attempt
to
loosen
.
<EOS>
She
show
a
good
heart
,
thenceforth
,
in
avoid
both
complaint
and
expression
of
antipathy
concern
Heathcliff
;
and
confess
to
me
her
sorrow
that
she
have
endeavour
to
raise
a
bad
spirit
between
him
and
Hareton
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
believe
she
have
ever
breathe
a
syllable
,
in
the
latter
's
hearing
,
against
her
oppressor
since
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
slight
disagreement
be
over
,
they
be
friend
again
,
and
as
busy
as
possible
in
their
several
occupation
of
pupil
and
teacher
.
<EOS>
I
come
in
to
sit
with
them
,
after
I
have
do
my
work
;
and
I
feel
so
soothe
and
comfort
to
watch
them
,
<EOS>
that
I
do
not
notice
how
time
get
on
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
they
both
appear
in
a
measure
my
child
<EOS>
:
I
have
long
be
proud
of
one
;
and
now
,
I
be
sure
,
the
other
would
be
a
source
of
equal
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
His
honest
,
warm
,
and
intelligent
nature
shake
off
rapidly
the
cloud
of
ignorance
and
degradation
in
which
it
have
be
breed
;
and
Catherine
's
sincere
commendation
act
as
a
spur
to
his
industry
.
<EOS>
His
brightening
mind
brighten
his
feature
,
and
add
spirit
and
nobility
to
their
aspect
:
I
could
hardly
fancy
it
<EOS>
the
same
individual
<EOS>
I
have
beheld
on
the
day
I
discover
my
little
lady
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
after
her
expedition
to
the
Crags
.
<EOS>
while
I
admire
and
they
labour
,
dusk
draw
on
,
and
with
it
return
the
master
.
<EOS>
He
come
upon
us
quite
unexpectedly
,
enter
by
the
front
way
,
and
have
a
full
view
of
the
whole
three
,
ere
we
could
raise
our
head
to
glance
at
him
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
reflect
,
there
be
never
a
pleasanter
,
or
more
harmless
sight
;
and
it
will
be
a
burn
shame
to
scold
them
.
<EOS>
the
red
fire
-
light
glow
on
their
two
bonny
head
,
and
reveal
their
face
animate
with
the
eager
interest
of
child
;
for
,
though
he
be
twenty
-
three
and
she
eighteen
,
each
have
so
much
of
novelty
to
feel
and
learn
,
that
neither
experience
nor
evince
the
sentiment
of
sober
disenchanted
maturity
.
  
<EOS>
They
lift
their
eye
together
,
to
encounter
Mr.
Heathcliff
<EOS>
:
perhaps
you
have
never
remark
that
their
eye
be
precisely
similar
,
and
they
be
those
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
.
<EOS>
the
present
Catherine
have
no
other
likeness
to
her
,
except
a
breadth
of
forehead
,
and
a
certain
arch
of
the
nostril
that
make
her
appear
rather
haughty
,
whether
she
will
or
not
.
<EOS>
with
Hareton
the
resemblance
be
carry
farther
:
it
be
singular
at
all
time
,
_
then
_
it
be
particularly
striking
;
because
his
sense
be
alert
,
and
his
mental
faculty
waken
to
unwonted
activity
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
this
resemblance
disarm
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
he
walk
to
the
hearth
in
evident
agitation
;
but
it
quickly
subside
as
he
look
at
the
young
man
:
or
,
I
should
say
,
alter
its
character
;
for
it
be
there
yet
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
book
from
his
hand
,
and
glance
at
the
open
page
,
then
return
it
without
any
observation
;
merely
sign
Catherine
away
:
her
companion
linger
very
little
behind
her
,
and
I
be
about
to
depart
also
,
but
he
bid
me
sit
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
poor
conclusion
,
be
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
observe
,
have
brood
awhile
on
the
scene
he
have
just
witness
:
"
an
absurd
termination
to
my
violent
exertion
?
<EOS>
I
get
lever
and
mattock
to
demolish
the
two
house
,
and
train
myself
to
be
capable
of
work
like
hercule
,
and
when
everything
be
ready
and
in
my
power
,
I
find
the
will
to
lift
a
slate
off
either
roof
have
vanish
!
<EOS>
My
old
enemy
have
not
beat
me
;
now
would
be
the
precise
time
to
revenge
myself
on
their
representative
:
I
could
do
it
;
and
none
could
hinder
me
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
use
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
strike
<EOS>
:
I
can
not
take
the
trouble
to
raise
my
hand
!
<EOS>
that
sound
as
if
I
have
be
labour
the
whole
time
only
to
exhibit
a
fine
trait
of
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
It
be
far
from
be
the
case
:
I
have
lose
the
faculty
of
enjoy
their
destruction
,
and
I
be
too
idle
to
destroy
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
nelly
,
there
be
a
strange
change
approach
;
I
be
in
its
shadow
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
take
so
little
interest
in
my
daily
life
that
I
hardly
remember
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
those
two
who
have
leave
the
room
be
the
only
object
which
retain
a
distinct
material
appearance
to
me
;
and
that
appearance
cause
me
pain
,
amount
to
agony
.
<EOS>
about
_
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
will
not
speak
;
and
I
do
not
desire
to
think
;
but
I
earnestly
wish
she
be
invisible
:
her
presence
invoke
only
madden
sensation
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
move
me
differently
:
<EOS>
and
yet
if
I
could
do
it
without
seem
insane
,
I
would
never
see
him
again
!
<EOS>
You
will
perhaps
think
me
rather
incline
to
become
so
,
"
he
add
,
make
an
effort
to
smile
,
"
if
I
try
to
describe
the
thousand
form
of
past
association
and
idea
he
awaken
or
embodie
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
not
talk
of
what
I
tell
you
;
and
my
mind
be
so
eternally
seclude
in
itself
,
it
be
tempt
at
last
to
turn
it
out
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
five
minute
ago
Hareton
seem
a
personification
of
my
youth
,
not
a
human
being
;
I
feel
to
him
in
such
a
variety
of
way
,
that
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
have
accost
him
rationally
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
his
startling
likeness
to
Catherine
connect
him
fearfully
with
her
.
<EOS>
that
,
however
,
which
you
may
suppose
the
most
potent
to
arrest
my
imagination
,
be
actually
the
least
:
for
what
be
not
connect
with
her
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
what
do
not
recall
her
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
down
to
this
floor
,
but
her
feature
be
shape
in
the
flag
!
<EOS>
in
every
cloud
,
in
every
tree
 
fill
the
air
at
night
,
and
catch
by
glimpse
in
every
object
by
day
 
I
be
surround
with
her
image
!
<EOS>
the
most
ordinary
face
of
man
and
woman
 
my
own
feature
 
<EOS>
mock
me
with
a
resemblance
.
<EOS>
the
entire
world
be
a
dreadful
collection
of
memoranda
that
she
do
exist
,
and
that
I
have
lose
her
!
<EOS>
well
,
Hareton
's
aspect
be
the
ghost
of
my
immortal
love
;
of
my
wild
endeavour
to
hold
my
right
;
my
degradation
,
my
pride
,
my
happiness
,
and
my
anguish
    
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
frenzy
to
repeat
these
thought
to
you
:
only
it
will
let
you
know
why
,
with
a
reluctance
to
be
always
alone
,
his
society
be
no
benefit
;
rather
an
aggravation
of
the
constant
torment
I
suffer
:
and
it
partly
contribute
to
render
me
regardless
how
he
and
his
cousin
go
on
together
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
them
no
attention
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
_
change
_
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
alarm
at
his
manner
:
though
he
be
neither
in
danger
of
lose
his
sense
,
nor
die
,
accord
to
my
judgment
:
he
be
quite
strong
and
healthy
;
and
,
as
to
his
reason
,
from
childhood
he
have
a
delight
in
dwell
on
dark
thing
,
and
entertain
odd
fancy
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
have
a
monomania
on
the
subject
of
his
departed
idol
;
but
on
every
other
point
his
wit
be
as
sound
as
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
know
that
till
it
come
,
"
he
say
;
"
I
be
only
half
conscious
of
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
feeling
of
illness
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
nelly
,
I
have
not
,
"
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
not
afraid
of
death
?
<EOS>
"
I
pursue
.
  
<EOS>
"
afraid
?
<EOS>
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
neither
a
fear
,
nor
a
presentiment
,
nor
a
hope
of
death
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
with
my
hard
constitution
and
temperate
mode
of
living
,
and
unperilous
occupation
,
I
ought
to
,
and
probably
_
shall
_
,
remain
above
ground
till
there
be
scarcely
a
black
hair
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
continue
in
this
condition
!
<EOS>
I
have
to
remind
myself
to
breathe
 
almost
to
remind
my
heart
to
beat
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
like
bend
back
a
stiff
spring
<EOS>
:
it
be
by
compulsion
that
I
do
the
slight
act
not
prompt
by
one
thought
;
and
by
compulsion
that
I
notice
anything
alive
or
dead
,
which
be
not
associate
with
one
universal
idea
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
single
wish
,
and
my
whole
being
and
faculty
be
yearn
to
attain
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
yearn
towards
it
so
long
,
and
so
unwaveringly
,
that
I
be
convinced
it
will
be
reach
 
and
soon
 
because
it
have
devour
my
existence
:
I
be
swallow
up
in
the
anticipation
of
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
My
confession
have
not
relieve
me
;
but
they
may
account
for
some
otherwise
unaccountable
phase
of
humour
which
I
show
.
<EOS>
o
God
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
fight
;
I
wish
it
be
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
pace
the
room
,
mutter
terrible
thing
to
himself
,
till
I
be
inclined
to
believe
,
as
he
say
Joseph
do
,
that
conscience
have
turn
his
heart
to
an
earthly
hell
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
greatly
how
it
would
end
.
<EOS>
though
he
seldom
before
have
reveal
this
state
of
mind
,
even
by
look
,
it
be
his
habitual
mood
,
I
have
no
doubt
:
he
assert
it
himself
;
but
not
a
soul
,
from
his
general
bearing
,
would
have
conjecture
the
fact
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
when
you
see
him
,
Mr.
Lockwood
:
<EOS>
and
at
the
period
of
which
I
speak
,
he
be
just
the
same
as
then
;
only
fonder
of
continue
solitude
,
and
perhaps
still
more
laconic
in
company
.
    
<EOS>
for
some
day
after
that
evening
Mr.
Heathcliff
shun
meet
us
at
meal
;
yet
he
would
not
consent
formally
to
exclude
Hareton
and
Cathy
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
aversion
to
yield
so
completely
to
his
feeling
,
choose
rather
to
absent
himself
;
and
eat
once
in
twenty
-
four
hour
seem
sufficient
sustenance
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
,
after
the
family
be
in
bed
,
I
hear
him
go
downstairs
,
and
out
at
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
hear
him
re
-
enter
,
and
in
the
morning
I
find
he
be
still
away
.
<EOS>
We
be
in
April
then
:
the
weather
be
sweet
and
warm
,
the
grass
as
green
as
shower
and
sun
could
make
it
,
and
the
two
dwarf
apple
-
tree
near
the
southern
wall
in
full
bloom
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
Catherine
insist
on
my
bring
a
chair
and
sit
with
my
work
under
the
fir
-
tree
at
the
end
of
the
house
;
and
she
beguile
Hareton
,
who
have
perfectly
recover
from
his
accident
,
to
dig
and
arrange
her
little
garden
,
which
be
shift
to
that
corner
by
the
influence
of
Joseph
's
complaint
.
<EOS>
I
be
comfortably
revel
in
the
spring
fragrance
around
,
and
the
beautiful
soft
blue
overhead
,
when
my
young
lady
,
who
have
run
down
near
the
gate
to
procure
some
primrose
root
for
a
border
,
return
only
half
laden
,
and
inform
us
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
come
in
.

and
he
speak
to
me
,

she
add
,
with
a
perplex
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
say
?
"
ask
Hareton
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
tell
me
to
begone
as
fast
as
I
could

she
answer
.
<EOS>

but
he
look
so
different
from
his
usual
look
that
I
stop
a
moment
to
stare
at
him

<EOS>
"
night
-
walking
amuse
him
,
then
,
"
I
remark
,
affect
a
careless
manner
:
in
reality
as
surprised
as
she
be
,
and
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
statement
;
for
to
see
the
master
look
glad
would
not
be
an
every
-
day
spectacle

<EOS>
I
frame
an
excuse
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
Heathcliff
stand
at
the
open
door
;
he
be
pale
,
and
he
tremble
:
<EOS>
yet
,
certainly
,
he
have
a
strange
joyful
glitter
in
his
eye
,
that
alter
the
aspect
of
his
whole
face

<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
some
breakfast
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
hungry

ramble
about
all
night

"
I
want
to
discover
where
he
have
be
,
but
I
do
not
like
to
ask
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
not
hungry
,
"
he
answer
,
avert
his
head
,
and
speak
rather
contemptuously
,
as
if
he
guess
I
be
try
to
divine
the
occasion
of
his
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
perplexed
:
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
not
a
proper
opportunity
to
offer
a
bit
of
admonition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
right
to
wander
out
of
door
,
"
I
observe
,
"
instead
of
be
in
bed
:
it
be
not
wise
,
at
any
rate
this
moist
season
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
will
catch
a
bad
cold
or
a
fever
:
you
have
something
the
matter
with
you
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
but
what
I
can
bear
,
"
he
reply
;
"
and
with
the
great
pleasure
,
provide
you
will
leave
me
alone
:
get
in
,
and
do
not
annoy
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
obey
:
and
,
in
passing
,
I
notice
he
breathe
as
fast
as
a
cat
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
!
<EOS>
"
I
reflect
to
myself
,
"
we
shall
have
a
fit
of
illness
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
what
he
have
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
noon
he
sit
down
to
dinner
with
us
,
and
receive
a
heap
-
up
plate
from
my
hand
,
as
if
he
intend
to
make
amend
for
previous
fasting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
neither
cold
nor
fever
,
nelly
,
"
he
remark
,
in
allusion
to
my
morning
's
speech
;
"
and
I
be
ready
to
do
justice
to
the
food
you
give
me

<EOS>
He
take
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
be
go
to
commence
eating
,
when
the
inclination
appear
to
become
suddenly
extinct
.
<EOS>
He
lay
them
on
the
table
,
look
eagerly
towards
the
window
,
then
rise
and
go
out
.
<EOS>
We
see
him
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
while
we
conclude
our
meal
,
and
Earnshaw
say
he
would
go
and
ask
why
he
would
not
dine
<EOS>
:
he
think
we
have
grieve
him
some
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
be
he
come
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Catherine
,
when
her
cousin
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
he
answer
;
"
but
he
be
not
angry
:
he
seem
rarely
pleased
indeed
;
only
I
make
him
impatient
by
speak
to
him
twice
;
and
then
he
bid
me
be
off
to
you
:
<EOS>
he
wonder
how
I
could
want
the
company
of
anybody
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
his
plate
to
keep
warm
on
the
fender
;
and
after
an
hour
or
two
he
re
-
enter
,
when
the
room
be
clear
,
in
no
degree
calmer
:
<EOS>
the
same
unnatural
 
<EOS>
it
be
unnatural
 
appearance
of
joy
under
his
black
brow
;
the
same
bloodless
hue
,
and
his
tooth
visible
,
now
and
then
,
in
a
kind
of
smile
;
his
frame
shivering
,
not
as
one
shiver
with
chill
or
weakness
,
but
as
a
tight
-
stretch
cord
vibrate
 
a
strong
thrilling
,
rather
than
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
I
think
;
or
who
should
?
<EOS>
and
I
exclaim
 
"
have
you
hear
any
good
news
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
<EOS>
You
look
uncommonly
animate

<EOS>
"
where
should
good
news
come
from
to
me

<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
animate
with
hunger

seemingly
,
I
must
not
eat

<EOS>
"
Your

I

you
get
it
?

it
now

,
hastily
:

I
will
wait
till
supper

and
,
nelly
,
once
for
all

let
me
beg
you
to
warn
Hareton
and
the
other
away
from

trouble

have
this
place
to
myself

there
some
new

for

banishment

inquire

tell
me
why
you
be
so
queer

Mr.
Heathcliff

you
last
night

the
question

idle
curiosity

"
You
be
put
the
question
through
very
idle
curiosity

he
interrupt
,
with
a
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
yet
I
will
answer
it
.
<EOS>
last
night
I
be
on
the
threshold
of
hell
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
I
be
within
sight
of
my
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
eye
on
it
:
hardly
three
foot
to
sever
me
!
<EOS>
and
now
you
would
better
go
!
<EOS>
You
will
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
to
frighten
you
,
if
you
refrain
from
pry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
sweep
the
hearth
and
wipe
the
table
,
I
depart
;
more
perplexed
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
quit
the
house
again
that
afternoon
,
and
no
one
intrude
on
his
solitude
;
till
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
I
deem
it
proper
,
though
unsummoned
,
to
carry
a
candle
and
his
supper
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
lean
against
the
ledge
of
an
open
lattice
,
but
not
look
out
:
his
face
be
turn
to
the
interior
gloom
.
<EOS>
the
fire
have
smoulder
to
ashe
;
the
room
be
fill
with
the
damp
,
mild
air
of
the
cloudy
evening
;
and
so
still
,
that
not
only
the
murmur
of
the
beck
down
Gimmerton
be
distinguishable
,
but
its
ripple
and
its
gurgling
over
the
pebble
,
or
through
the
large
stone
which
it
could
not
cover
.
<EOS>
I
utter
an
ejaculation
of
discontent
at
see
the
dismal
grate
,
and
commence
shut
the
casement
,
one
after
another
,
till
I
come
to
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
close
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
in
order
to
rouse
him
;
for
he
would
not
stir
.
  
<EOS>
the
light
flash
on
his
feature
as
I
speak
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
can
not
express
what
a
terrible
start
<EOS>
I
get
by
the
momentary
view
!
<EOS>
those
deep
black
eye
!
<EOS>
that
smile
,
and
ghastly
paleness
!
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
,
not
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
but
a
goblin
;
and
,
in
my
terror
,
I
let
the
candle
bend
towards
the
wall
,
and
it
leave
me
in
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
close
it
,
"
he
reply
,
in
his
familiar
voice
.
<EOS>
"
there
,
that
be
pure
awkwardness
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
hold
the
candle
horizontally
?
<EOS>
be
quick
,
and
bring
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hurry
out
in
a
foolish
state
of
dread
,
and
say
to
Joseph
 
"
the
master
wish
you
to
take
him
a
light
and
rekindle
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
for
I
dare
not
go
in
myself
again
just
then
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
rattle
some
fire
into
the
shovel
,
and
go
:
but
he
bring
it
back
immediately
,
with
the
supper
-
tray
in
his
other
hand
,
explain
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
go
to
bed
,
and
he
want
nothing
to
eat
till
morning
.
<EOS>
We
hear
him
mount
the
stair
directly
;
he
do
not
proceed
to
his
ordinary
chamber
,
but
turn
into
that
with
the
panelled
bed
:
its
window
,
as
I
mention
before
,
be
wide
enough
for
anybody
to
get
through
;
and
it
strike
me
that
he
plot
another
midnight
excursion
,
of
which
he
have
<EOS>
rather
we
have
no
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
a
ghoul
or
a
vampire
?
<EOS>
"
I
muse
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
such
hideous
incarnate
demon
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
set
myself
to
reflect
how
I
have
tend
him
in
infancy
,
and
watch
him
grow
to
youth
,
and
follow
him
almost
through
his
whole
course
;
and
what
absurd
nonsense
it
be
to
yield
to
that
sense
of
horror
.
<EOS>
"
but
where
do
he
come
from
,
the
little
dark
thing
,
harbour
by
a
good
man
to
his
bane
?
"
<EOS>
mutter
Superstition
,
as
I
doze
into
unconsciousness
.
<EOS>
and
I
begin
,
half
dream
,
to
weary
myself
with
imagine
some
fit
parentage
for
him
;
and
,
repeat
my
wake
meditation
,
I
track
his
existence
over
again
,
with
grim
variation
;
at
last
,
picture
his
death
and
funeral
:
of
which
,
all
I
can
remember
be
,
be
exceedingly
vexed
at
have
the
task
of
dictate
an
inscription
for
his
monument
,
and
consult
the
sexton
about
it
;
and
,
as
he
have
no
surname
,
and
we
could
not
tell
his
age
,
we
be
oblige
to
content
ourselves
with
the
single
word
,
"
Heathcliff
.
"
<EOS>
that
come
true
:
we
be
.
<EOS>
if
you
enter
the
kirkyard
,
you
will
read
,
on
his
headstone
,
only
that
,
and
the
date
of
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
Dawn
restore
me
to
common
sense
.
<EOS>
I
rise
,
and
go
into
the
garden
,
as
soon
as
I
could
see
,
to
ascertain
if
there
be
any
footmark
under
his
window
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
stay
at
home
,
"
I
think
,
"
and
he
will
be
all
right
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
prepare
breakfast
for
the
household
,
as
be
my
usual
custom
,
but
tell
Hareton
and
Catherine
to
get
theirs
ere
<EOS>
the
master
come
down
,
for
he
lie
late
.
<EOS>
They
prefer
take
it
out
of
door
,
under
the
tree
,
and
I
set
a
little
table
to
accommodate
them
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
re
-
entrance
,
I
find
Mr.
Heathcliff
below
.
<EOS>
He
and
Joseph
be
converse
about
some
farming
business
;
he
give
clear
,
minute
direction
concern
the
matter
discuss
,
but
he
speak
rapidly
,
and
turn
his
head
continually
aside
,
and
have
the
same
excited
expression
,
even
more
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
when
Joseph
quit
the
room
he
take
his
seat
in
the
place
he
generally
choose
,
and
I
put
a
basin
of
coffee
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
draw
it
nearer
,
and
then
rest
his
arm
on
the
table
,
and
look
at
the
opposite
wall
,
as
I
suppose
,
survey
one
particular
portion
,
up
and
down
,
with
glittering
,
restless
eye
,
and
with
such
eager
interest
that
he
stop
breathe
during
half
a
minute
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
now
,
"
I
exclaim
,
push
some
bread
against
his
hand
,
"
eat
and
drink
that
,
while
it
be
hot
:
it
have
be
wait
near
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
notice
me
,
and
yet
he
smile
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
see
him
gnash
his
tooth
than
smile
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
<EOS>
master
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
"
do
not
,
for
God
's
sake
,
stare
as
if
you
see
an
unearthly
vision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
for
God
's
sake
,
shout
so
loud
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
turn
round
,
and
tell
me
,
be
we
by
ourselves
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
be
my
answer
;
"
of
course
we
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
still
,
I
involuntarily
obey
him
,
as
if
I
be
not
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
he
clear
a
vacant
space
in
front
among
the
breakfast
thing
,
and
leant
forward
to
gaze
more
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
I
perceive
he
be
not
look
at
the
wall
;
for
when
I
regard
him
alone
,
it
seem
exactly
that
he
gaze
at
something
within
two
yard
'
distance
.
<EOS>
and
whatever
it
be
,
it
communicate
,
apparently
,
both
pleasure
and
pain
in
exquisite
extreme
:
at
least
the
anguish
,
yet
rapture
,
expression
of
his
countenance
suggest
that
idea
.
<EOS>
the
fancied
object
be
not
fix
,
either
:
his
eye
pursue
it
with
unwearied
diligence
,
and
,
even
in
speak
to
me
,
be
never
wean
away
.
<EOS>
I
vainly
remind
him
of
his
protract
abstinence
from
food
:
if
he
stir
to
touch
anything
in
compliance
with
my
entreaty
,
if
he
stretch
his
hand
out
to
get
a
piece
of
bread
,
his
finger
clench
before
they
reach
it
,
and
remain
on
the
table
,
forgetful
of
their
aim
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
,
a
model
of
patience
,
try
to
attract
his
absorb
attention
from
its
engross
speculation
;
till
he
grow
irritable
,
and
get
up
,
ask
why
I
would
not
allow
him
to
have
his
own
time
in
take
his
meal
?
and
say
that
on
the
next
occasion
I
need
not
wait
:
<EOS>
I
may
set
the
thing
down
and
go
.
<EOS>
have
utter
these
word
he
leave
the
house
,
slowly
saunter
down
the
garden
path
,
and
disappear
through
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
the
hour
creep
anxiously
by
:
another
evening
come
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
retire
to
rest
till
late
,
and
when
I
do
,
I
could
not
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
return
after
midnight
,
and
,
instead
of
go
to
bed
,
shut
himself
into
the
room
beneath
.
<EOS>
I
listen
,
and
toss
about
,
and
,
finally
,
dress
and
descend
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
irksome
to
lie
there
,
harass
my
brain
with
a
hundred
idle
misgiving
.
  
<EOS>
I
distinguish
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
step
,
restlessly
measure
the
floor
,
and
he
frequently
break
the
silence
by
a
deep
inspiration
,
resemble
a
groan
.
<EOS>
He
mutter
detach
word
also
;
the
only
one
I
could
catch
be
the
name
of
Catherine
,
couple
with
some
wild
term
of
endearment
or
suffering
;
and
speak
as
one
would
speak
to
a
person
present
;
low
and
earnest
,
and
wrung
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
courage
to
walk
straight
into
the
apartment
;
but
I
desire
to
divert
him
from
his
reverie
,
and
therefore
fall
foul
of
the
kitchen
fire
,
stir
it
,
and
begin
to
scrape
the
cinder
.
<EOS>
It
draw
him
forth
sooner
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
He
open
the
door
immediately
,
and
say
 
"
nelly
,
come
here
 
be
it
morning
?
<EOS>
come
in
with
your
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
strike
four
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
a
candle
to
take
up
-
stair
:
you
may
have
light
one
at
this
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
wish
to
go
up
-
stair
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
and
kindle
_
me
_
a
fire
,
and
do
anything
there
be
to
do
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
blow
the
coal
red
first
,
before
I
can
carry
any
,
"
I
reply
,
get
a
chair
and
the
bellow
.
  
<EOS>
He
roam
to
and
fro
,
meantime
,
in
a
state
approach
distraction
;
his
heavy
sigh
succeed
each
other
so
thick
as
to
leave
no
space
for
common
breathing
between
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
day
break
I
will
send
for
Green
,
"
he
say
;
"
I
wish
to
make
some
legal
inquiry
of
him
while
I
can
bestow
a
thought
on
those
matter
,
and
while
I
can
act
calmly
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
write
my
will
yet
;
and
how
to
leave
my
property
<EOS>
I
can
not
determine
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
annihilate
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
talk
so
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
"
I
interpose
.
<EOS>
"
let
your
will
be
a
while
:
you
will
be
spare
to
repent
of
your
many
injustice
yet
!

I
never
expect
that
your
nerve
would
be
disorder
:
they
be
,
at
present
,
marvellously
so
,
however
;
and
almost
entirely
through
your
own
fault

<EOS>
the
way
you
have
pass
these
three
last
day
may
knock
up
a
Titan

do
take
some
food
,
and
some
repose

<EOS>
You
need
only
look
at
yourself
in
a
glass
to
see
how
you
require
both

<EOS>
Your
cheek
be
hollow

and
your
eye

shot

with
hunger

blind

loss
of
sleep

It
be
not
my
fault

I
can
not

he
reply

I
assure
you
it
be
through
no
settled
design

I
will
do
both

as
soon

can

you
may
as
well
bid
a
man
struggle
in
the
water
rest

arm

length
of
the
shore

I
must
reach
it
first

will
rest

well

never
mind
Mr.
Green

as
to
repent
of
my
injustice

I
have
do
no
injustice

I
repent

nothing

happy

if
you

I
may

happy

that
from

<EOS>
"
I
be
rather
oblige
than
angry
,
nelly
,
"
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
remind
me
of
the
manner
in
which
I
desire
to
be
bury
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
carry
to
the
churchyard
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
You
and
Hareton
may
,
if
you
please
,
accompany
me
:
and
mind
,
particularly
,
to
notice
that
the
sexton
obey
my
direction
concern
the
two
coffin
!
<EOS>
no
minister
nee
come
;
nor
need
anything
be
say
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
have
nearly
attain
_
my
_
heaven
;
and
that
of
other
be
altogether
unvalued
and
uncoveted
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
suppose
you
persevere
in
your
obstinate
fast
,
and
die
by
that
mean
,
and
they
refuse
to
bury
you
in
the
precinct
of
the
kirk
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
shock
at
his
godless
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
how
would
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
do
that
,
"
he
reply
:
"
<EOS>
if
they
do
,
you
must
have
me
remove
secretly
;
and
if
you
neglect
it
you
shall
prove
,
practically
,
that
the
dead
be
not
annihilate
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
hear
the
other
member
of
the
family
stir
he
retire
to
his
den
,
and
I
breathe
free
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
afternoon
,
while
Joseph
and
Hareton
be
at
their
work
,
he
come
into
the
kitchen
again
,
and
,
with
a
wild
look
,
bid
me
come
and
sit
in
the
house
:
he
want
somebody
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
decline
;
tell
him
plainly
that
his
strange
talk
and
manner
frighten
me
,
and
I
have
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
will
to
be
his
companion
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
think
me
a
fiend
,
"
he
say
,
with
his
dismal
laugh
:
"
something
too
horrible
to
live
under
a
decent
roof
.
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Catherine
,
who
be
there
,
and
who
draw
behind
me
at
his
approach
,
he
add
,
half
sneeringly
,
 
"
Will
_
you
_
come
,
chuck
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
to
you
I
have
make
myself
bad
than
the
devil
.
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
_
one
<EOS>
_
who
will
not
shrink
from
my
company
!
<EOS>
by
God
!
<EOS>
she
be
relentless
.
<EOS>
oh
,
damn
it
!
<EOS>
It
be
unutterably
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
 
even
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
solicit
the
society
of
no
one
more
.
<EOS>
at
dusk
he
go
into
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
through
the
whole
night
,
and
far
into
the
morning
,
we
hear
him
groan
and
murmur
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Hareton
be
anxious
to
enter
;
but
I
bid
him
fetch
Mr.
Kenneth
,
and
he
should
go
in
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
,
and
I
request
admittance
and
try
to
open
the
door
,
I
find
it
lock
;
and
Heathcliff
bid
us
be
damn
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
,
and
would
be
leave
alone
;
so
the
doctor
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
follow
evening
be
very
wet
:
indeed
,
it
pour
down
till
day
-
dawn
;
and
,
as
I
take
my
morning
walk
round
the
house
,
I
observe
the
master
's
window
swinging
open
,
and
the
rain
drive
straight
in
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
in
bed
,
I
think
:
those
shower
would
drench
him
through
.
<EOS>
He
must
either
be
up
or
out
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
make
no
more
ado
,
I
will
go
boldly
and
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
have
succeed
in
obtain
entrance
with
another
key
,
I
run
to
unclose
the
panel
,
for
the
chamber
be
vacant
;
quickly
push
them
aside
,
I
peep
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Heathcliff
be
there
 
lay
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
His
eye
meet
mine
so
keen
and
fierce
,
I
start
;
and
then
he
seem
to
smile
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
think
him
dead
:
but
his
face
and
throat
be
wash
with
rain
;
the
bed
-
clothe
drip
,
and
he
be
perfectly
still
.
<EOS>
the
lattice
,
flap
to
and
fro
,
have
graze
one
hand
that
rest
on
the
sill
;
no
blood
trickle
from
the
broken
skin
,
and
when
I
put
my
finger
to
it
,
I
could
doubt
no
more
:
<EOS>
he
be
dead
and
stark
!
  
<EOS>
I
hasp
the
window
;
I
comb
his
black
long
hair
from
his
forehead
;
I
try
to
close
his
eye
:
to
extinguish
,
if
possible
,
that
frightful
,
life
-
like
gaze
of
exultation
before
any
one
else
beheld
it
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
shut
:
they
seem
to
sneer
at
my
attempt
;
and
his
part
lip
and
sharp
white
tooth
sneer
too
!
<EOS>
take
with
another
fit
of
cowardice
,
I
cry
out
for
Joseph
.
<EOS>
Joseph
shuffle
up
and
make
a
noise
,
but
resolutely
refuse
to
meddle
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
th
'
divil
's
harry
off
his
soul
,
"
he
cry
,
"
and
<EOS>
he
may
hev
'
his
carcass
into
t
'
bargin
,
for
aught
I
care
!
<EOS>
Ech
!
<EOS>
what
a
wicked
'
un
he
look
,
girne
at
death
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
old
sinner
grin
in
mockery
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
intend
to
cut
a
caper
round
the
bed
;
but
suddenly
compose
himself
,
he
fall
on
his
knee
,
and
raise
his
hand
,
and
return
thank
that
the
lawful
master
and
the
ancient
stock
be
restore
to
their
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
stun
by
the
awful
event
;
and
my
memory
unavoidably
recur
to
former
time
with
a
sort
of
oppressive
sadness
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Hareton
,
the
most
wronged
,
be
the
only
one
who
really
suffer
much
.
<EOS>
He
sit
by
the
corpse
all
night
,
weep
in
bitter
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
press
its
hand
,
and
kiss
the
sarcastic
,
savage
face
that
every
one
else
shrink
from
contemplate
;
and
bemoan
him
with
that
strong
grief
which
spring
naturally
from
a
generous
heart
,
though
it
be
tough
as
temper
steel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kenneth
be
perplex
to
pronounce
of
what
disorder
the
master
die
.
<EOS>
I
conceal
the
fact
of
his
have
swallow
nothing
for
four
day
,
fear
it
may
lead
to
trouble
,
and
then
,
I
be
persuade
,
he
do
not
abstain
on
purpose
:
it
be
the
consequence
of
his
strange
illness
,
not
the
cause
.
  
<EOS>
We
bury
him
,
to
the
scandal
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
as
he
wish
.
<EOS>
Earnshaw
and
I
,
the
sexton
,
and
six
man
to
carry
the
coffin
,
comprehend
the
whole
attendance
.
<EOS>
the
six
man
depart
when
they
have
let
it
down
into
the
grave
:
we
stay
to
see
it
cover
.
<EOS>
Hareton
,
with
a
streaming
face
,
dig
green
sod
,
and
lay
them
over
the
brown
mould
himself
:
at
present
it
be
as
smooth
and
verdant
as
its
companion
mound
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
its
tenant
sleep
as
soundly
.
<EOS>
but
the
country
folk
,
if
you
ask
them
,
would
swear
on
the
Bible
that
he
_
walk
_
:
there
be
those
who
speak
to
have
meet
him
near
the
church
,
and
on
the
moor
,
and
even
within
this
house
.
<EOS>
idle
tale
,
you
will
say
,
and
<EOS>
so
say
I.
<EOS>
yet
that
old
man
by
the
kitchen
fire
affirm
he
have
see
two
on
'em
look
out
of
his
chamber
window
on
every
rainy
night
since
his
death
:
 
and
an
odd
thing
happen
to
me
about
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
the
Grange
one
evening
 
<EOS>
a
dark
evening
,
threaten
thunder
 
and
,
just
at
the
turn
of
the
Heights
,
I
encounter
a
little
boy
with
a
sheep
and
two
lamb
before
him
;
he
be
cry
terribly
;
and
I
suppose
the
lamb
be
skittish
,
and
would
not
be
guide
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
my
little
man
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
Heathcliff
and
a
woman
yonder
,
under
t
'
nab
,
"
he
blubber
,
"
un
'
<EOS>
I
darnut
pass
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
;
but
neither
the
sheep
nor
he
would
go
on
<EOS>
so
I
bid
him
take
the
road
lower
down
.
<EOS>
He
probably
raise
the
phantom
from
think
,
as
he
traverse
the
moor
alone
,
on
the
nonsense
he
have
hear
his
parent
and
companion
repeat
.
<EOS>
yet
,
still
,
I
do
not
like
be
out
in
the
dark
now
;
and
I
do
not
like
be
leave
by
myself
in
this
grim
house
:
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
;
I
shall
be
glad
when
they
leave
it
,
and
shift
to
the
Grange
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
go
to
the
grange
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Dean
,
"
as
soon
as
they
be
married
,
and
that
will
be
on
New
Year
's
Day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
who
will
live
here
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Joseph
will
take
care
of
the
house
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
lad
to
keep
him
company
.
<EOS>
They
will
live
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
rest
will
be
shut
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
the
use
of
such
ghost
as
choose
to
inhabit
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
observe
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
"
say
nelly
,
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
the
dead
be
at
peace
:
but
it
be
not
right
to
speak
of
them
with
levity
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
garden
gate
swing
to
;
the
rambler
be
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
They
_
be
afraid
of
nothing
,
"
I
grumble
,
watch
their
approach
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
together
,
they
would
brave
Satan
and
all
his
legion
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
they
step
on
to
the
door
-
stone
,
and
halt
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
moon
 
or
,
more
correctly
,
at
each
other
by
her
light
 
<EOS>
I
feel
irresistibly
impel
to
escape
them
again
;
and
,
press
a
remembrance
into
the
hand
of
Mrs.
Dean
,
and
disregard
her
expostulation
at
my
rudeness
,
I
vanish
through
the
kitchen
as
they
open
the
house
-
door
;
and
so
should
have
confirm
Joseph
in
his
opinion
of
his
fellow
-
servant
's
gay
indiscretion
,
<EOS>
have
he
not
fortunately
recognise
me
for
a
respectable
character
by
the
sweet
ring
of
a
sovereign
at
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
My
walk
home
be
lengthen
by
a
diversion
in
the
direction
of
the
kirk
.
<EOS>
when
beneath
its
wall
,
I
perceive
decay
have
make
progress
,
even
in
seven
month
:
many
a
window
show
black
gap
deprive
of
glass
;
and
slate
jut
off
here
and
there
,
beyond
the
right
line
of
the
roof
,
to
be
gradually
work
off
in
come
autumn
storm
.
  
<EOS>
I
seek
,
and
soon
discover
,
the
three
headstone
on
the
slope
next
the
moor
:
the
middle
one
grey
,
and
half
bury
in
the
heath
;
Edgar
Linton
's
only
harmonize
by
the
turf
and
moss
creep
up
its
foot
;
Heathcliff
's
still
bare
.
  
<EOS>
I
linger
round
them
,
under
that
benign
sky
:
watch
the
moth
flutter
among
the
heath
and
harebell
,
listen
to
the
soft
wind
breathe
through
the
grass
,
and
wonder
how
any
one
could
ever
imagine
unquiet
slumber
for
the
sleeper
in
that
quiet
earth
.
