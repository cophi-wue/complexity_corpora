Miss

that
kind
of
beauty
which
seem
to
be
throw
into
relief
by
poor

Her
hand
and

be
so
finely
form
that
she
could
wear
sleeve
not
less
bare
of
style
than
those
in
which
the
Blessed
Virgin
appear
to
italian
painter
;
and
<EOS>
her
profile
as
well
as
her
stature
and
bearing
seem
to
gain
the
more
dignity
from
her
plain
garment
,
which
by
the
side
of
provincial
fashion
give
her
the
impressiveness
of
a
fine
quotation
from
the
Bible
,
 
or
from
one
of
our
elder
poet
,
 
in
a
paragraph
of
to

day
's
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
usually
speak
of
as
be
remarkably
clever
,
but
with
the
addition
that
her
sister
Celia
have
more
common
-
sense
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Celia
wear
scarcely
more
trimming
;
and
it
be
only
to
close
observer
that
her
dress
differ
from
her
sister
's
,
and
have
a
shade
of
coquetry
in
its
arrangement
;
for
Miss
Brooke
's
plain
dressing
be
due
to
mixed
condition
,
in
most
of
which
her
sister
share
.
 
<EOS>
the
pride
of
be
lady
have
something
to
do
with
it
:
the
Brooke
connection
,
though
not
exactly
aristocratic
,
be
unquestionably
"
good
:
"
if
you
inquire
backward
for
a
generation
or
two
,
you
would
not
find
any
yard
-
measuring
or
parcel
-
tie
forefather
 
anything
low
than
an
admiral
or
a
clergyman
;
and
there
be
even
an
ancestor
discernible
as
a
Puritan
gentleman
who
serve
under
Cromwell
,
but
afterwards
conform
,
and
manage
to
come
out
of
all
political
trouble
as
the
proprietor
of
a
respectable

estate
.
 
<EOS>
young
woman
of
such
birth
,
live
in
a
quiet
country
-
house
,
and
attend
a
village
church
hardly
large
than
a

,
naturally
regard
frippery
as
the
ambition
of
a

's

<EOS>
then
there
be
well

breed
economy

which
in

the

deduct
from
,
when
any
margin
be
require
for

more
distinctive
of

.
 
<EOS>
such
reason
would
have
be
enough
to
account
for
plain
dress
,
quite
apart
from
religious
feeling
;
but
in
Miss
Brooke
's
case
,
religion
alone
would
have
determine
it
;
and
Celia
mildly
acquiesce
in
all
her
sister
's
sentiment
,
only
infuse
them
with
that
common
-
sense
which
be
able

<EOS>
Dorothea
know
many
passage
of

by
heart

and
to
her
the

,
see
by
the
light
of
Christianity
,
make
the
solicitude
of
feminine
fashion
appear
an
occupation
for
Bedlam
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
reconcile
the
anxiety
of
a
spiritual
life
involve
eternal
consequence
,
with
a
keen
interest
in
gimp
and
artificial
protrusion
of
drapery
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
theoretic
,
and
yearn
by
its
nature
after
some
lofty
conception
of
the
world
which
may
frankly
include
the
parish
of
Tipton
and
her
own
rule
of
conduct
there
;
she
be
enamour
of

rash
in

whatever
seem

her

those
aspect

likely
to

to
make
retractation
,
and
then
to
incur
martyrdom
after
all
in
a
quarter
where
she
have
not
seek
it

<EOS>
certainly
such
element
in
the
character
of
a
marriageable

tend
to
interfere
with

and
hinder
it
from
be

<EOS>
with
all
this
,
she

the

be

twenty

and
they

both
be

since
they

about
twelve

lose
their

on
plan
at

narrow

promiscuous

first
in
an

afterwards
in
a

at

,
their

uncle

try
in

<EOS>
It
be

Grange
with

a

He
have

in

part
of
the

contract
a
too
ramble
habit

mind

<EOS>
Mr.

's
conclusion
be
as
difficult
to
predict
as
the
weather

it
be
only
safe
to
say
that
he
would
act
with
benevolent
intention

and
that
he
would
spend
as
little
money
as
possible
in

out

<EOS>
for
the
most
glutinously
indefinite
mind
enclose
some
hard
grain
of
habit

a

have
be
see
lax
about
all
his

the
retention

<EOS>
in
Mr.

the
hereditary

energy
be
clearly
in
abeyance

but
in
his

it
glow
alike
through
fault

turn
sometimes
into
impatience
of
her
uncle
's
talk
or
his
way
of
"
let

on
his
estate
,
and
make
her
long
all

the

she
would
be
of

have
some
command
of
money

generous

She

for
not

have
the

seven
hundred

their
parent
,
but
if
Dorothea
marry
and
have
a
son
,
that
son
would
inherit
Mr.

's
estate
,
presumably
worth
about
three
thousand
a

year
 
<EOS>
a
rental
which
seem

still
discuss
Mr.

innocent

a

nothing
could
hinder

<EOS>
her
love

insistence

accord

notion

cause
a

to
hesitate
before

those

though

find
that

unaccountably
reconcilable

Most

She

and
when
her
eye
and
cheek
glow
with
mingle
pleasure
she
look
very
little
like
a

<EOS>
Riding
be
an
indulgence
which
she
allow
herself
in
spite
of
conscientious

;
she
feel

she

it
in
a
pagan

always
look

to
renounce
it

She

open

ardent

not

admire

indeed
,
it
be
pretty
to
see
how
her
imagination
adorn
her
sister
Celia
with
attraction
altogether
superior
to
her
own

and
if
any
gentleman
appear
to
come
to
the
grange
from
some
other
motive
than
that
of
see
Mr.

,
she
conclude
that
he
must
be
in

with
Celia
:
<EOS>
Sir
James
Chettam
,
for
example

whom
she
constantly
consider
from

inwardly

that
he
should

regard
as
a
suitor
to

<EOS>
would
have
seem
to

a
ridiculous
irrelevance

<EOS>
Dorothea
,
with
all
her
eagerness
to
know
the
truth
of
life
,
retain
very
childlike
idea
about
marriage

<EOS>
She
feel
sure
that
she
would
have
accept
the
judicious
Hooker
,
if
she
have
be
bear
in
time
to
save
him
from
that
wretched
mistake
he
make
in
matrimony
;
or
John

when
his

or
any
of
the
other
great
man
whose
odd
habit
it
would
have
be
glorious
piety
to
endure
;
but
an
amiable
handsome
baronet
,
who
say
"
exactly
"
to
her
remark
even
when
she
express
uncertainty
,
 
how
could
he
affect
her
as
a
lover
?
 
<EOS>
the
really
delightful
marriage
must
be
that
where
your
husband
be
a
sort
of
father
,
and
could
teach
you
even
hebrew
,
if
you
wish
it
.
  
<EOS>
these
peculiarity
of
Dorothea
's
character
cause
Mr.
Brooke
to
be
all
the
more
blame
in
neighbor
family
for
not
secure
some
middle

aged
lady
as
guide
and
companion
to
his

<EOS>
but
he
himself
dread
so
much
the
sort
of
superior
woman
likely
to
be
available
for
such
a
position
,
that
he
allow
himself
to
be
dissuade
by
Dorothea
's
objection
,
and
be
in
this
case
brave
enough
to
defy
the
world
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
the
rector
's
wife
,
and
the
small
group
of
gentry
with
whom
he
visit
in
the
northeast
corner
of
Loamshire

so
Miss

preside
in

not

bent
on

a

delight
in

when
Celia

who
have

her
with
a
hesitating
desire
to
propose
something
,

"
Dorothea

if

if

we
look
at
mamma
's
jewel
to

day

and
divide
them
?
 
<EOS>
It

exactly
six
month
to

and
you

"
  
<EOS>
Celia
's
face
have
the
shadow
of
a
pouting
expression
in
it
,
the
full
presence
of
the
pout
be
keep
back
by
an
habitual
awe
of
Dorothea
and
principle
;
two
associate
fact
which
may
show
a
mysterious
electricity
if
you
touch
them
incautiously
.
 
<EOS>
to
her
relief

Dorothea

eye
be
full
of
laughter

up

Dorothea
speak
in

half
explanatory

in

's
memory

to
put
them
by

take
no
notice

necklace
be
quite

Madame
Poincon
,
who
be
strict
in
some
thing
even
than
you

use
to
wear

and
Christians

Celia
be
conscious

some
mental
strength

she
really
apply
herself
to
argument

"
You
would
like
to

<EOS>
exclaim
Dorothea
,
an
air
of
astonished
discovery
animate
her
whole
person
with
a
dramatic
action
which
she
have
catch
from
that
very
Madame
Poincon
who
wear
the
ornament

<EOS>
"
of
course
,
then
,
let
us
have
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
tell
me
before
?

but
the
key
,
the
key
!
"
<EOS>
She
press
her
hand
against
the
side
of
her
head
and
seem
to
despair
of
her
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
here
,
"
say
Celia
,
with
whom
this
explanation
have
be
long
meditate
and
prearrange

<EOS>
"
pray
open
the
large
drawer
of
the
cabinet

get
out
the
jewel

box

"
  
<EOS>
the
casket
be
soon
open
before
them
,
and
the
various
jewel
spread
out
,
make
a
bright
parterre
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
great
collection
,
but
a
few
of
the
ornament
be
really
of
remarkable
beauty
,
the
fine
that
be
obvious
at
first
be
a
necklace
of
purple
amethyst
set
in
exquisite
gold
work
,
and
a
pearl
cross
with
five
brilliant
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
immediately
take
up
the
necklace
and
fasten
it
round
her
sister
's
neck
,
where
it
fit
almost
as
closely
as
a
bracelet
;
but
the
circle
suit
the
Henrietta

Maria
style
of
Celia
's
head

neck
,
and
she
could
see
that
it
do
,
in
the
pier
-
glass
opposite

<EOS>
"
there
,
Celia
!
<EOS>
you
can
wear
that
with
your
indian
muslin

<EOS>
but
this
cross
you
must
wear
with
your
dark
dress
.

"
  
<EOS>
Celia
be
try
not
to
smile
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
Dodo
,
you
must
keep
the
cross
yourself

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

dear
,
no

"
say
Dorothea
,
put
up
her
hand
with
careless
deprecation
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
you
must
;
it
would
suit
you
 
in
your
black
dress

now

Celia

insistingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

wear
that

not

not

the
last
thing
I
would
wear
as
a
trinket

"
<EOS>
Dorothea
shudder
slightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
think
it
wicked
in
me
to
wear
it
,
"
say
Celia
,
uneasily
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear
,
no
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
stroke
her
sister
's
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
soul
have
complexion
too
:
what
will
suit
one
will
not
suit
another

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
like
to
keep
it
for
mamma
's
sake
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
have
other
thing
of
mamma
's
 
her
sandal
-
wood
box
which
I
be
so
fond
of
 
plenty
of
thing

<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
be
all
your
,
dear

<EOS>
We
need
discuss
them
no
longer

<EOS>
there
 
take
away
your
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Celia
feel
a
little
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strong
assumption
of
superiority
in
this
Puritanic
toleration
,
hardly
less
try
to
the
blond
flesh
of
an
unenthusiastic
sister
than
a
puritanic
persecution
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
can
I
wear
ornament
if
you
,
who
be
the
eld
sister
,
will
never
wear
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Celia
,
that
be
too
much
to
ask
,
that
I
should
wear
trinket
to
keep
you
in
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
put
on
such
a
necklace
as
that
,
I
should
feel
as
if
I
have
be
pirouette
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
would
go
round
with
me
,
and
I
should
not
know
how
to
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
Celia
have
unclasp
the
necklace
and
draw
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
little
tight
for
your
neck
;
something
to
lie
down
and
hang
would
suit
you
better
,
"
she
say
,
with
some
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
the
complete
unfitness
of
the
necklace
from
all
point
of
view
for
Dorothea
,
make
Celia
happy
in
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
open
some
ring
-
box
,
which
disclose
a
fine
emerald
with
diamond
,
and
just
then
the
sun
pass
beyond
a
cloud
send
a
bright
gleam
over
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
beautiful
these
gem
be
!
"
<EOS>
say
Dorothea
,
under
a
new
current
of
feeling
,
as
sudden
as
the
gleam
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
strange
how
deeply
color
seem
to
penetrate
one
,
like
scent
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
be
the
reason
why
gem
be
use
as
spiritual
emblem
in
the
Revelation
of
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
like
fragment
of
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
emerald
be
more
beautiful
than
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
there
be
a
bracelet
to
match
it
,
"
say
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
notice
this
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
lovely
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
slip
the
ring
and
bracelet
on
her
finely
turn
finger
and
wrist
,
and
hold
them
towards
the
window
on
a
level
with
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
while
her
thought
be
try
to
justify
her
delight
in
the
color
by
merge
them
in
her
mystic
religious
joy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
_
would
_
like
those
,
Dorothea
,
"
say
Celia
,
rather
falteringly
,
begin
to
think
with
wonder
that
her
sister
show
some
weakness
,
and
also
that
emerald
would
suit
her
own
complexion
even
better
than
purple
amethyst
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
keep
that
ring
and
bracelet
 
if
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
but
see
,
these
agate
be
very
pretty
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
keep
these
 
this
ring
and
bracelet
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
<EOS>
then
,
let
her
hand
fall
on
the
table
,
she
say
in
another
tone
 
"
yet
what
miserable
man
find
such
thing
,
and
work
at
them
,
and
sell
them
!
"
<EOS>
She
pause
again
,
and
Celia
think
that
her
sister
be
go
to
renounce
the
ornament
,
as
in
consistency
she
ought
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
,
I
will
keep
these
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
decidedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
take
all
the
rest
away
,
and
the
casket
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
up
her
pencil
without
remove
the
jewel
,
and
still
look
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
of
often
have
them
by
her
,
to
feed
her
eye
at
these
little
fountain
of
pure
color
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
wear
them
in
company
?
"
say
Celia
,
who
be
watch
her
with
real
curiosity
as
to
what
she
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
glance
quickly
at
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
across
all
her
imaginative
adornment
of
those
whom
she
love
,
there
dart
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
keen
discernment
,
which
be
not
without
a
scorching
quality
.
 
<EOS>
if
Miss
Brooke
ever
attain
perfect
meekness
,
it
would
not
be
for
lack
of
inward
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
she
say
,
rather
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
to
what
level
I
may
sink
.
"
  
<EOS>
Celia
blush
,
and
be
unhappy
<EOS>
:
she
see
that
she
have
offend
her
sister
,
and
dare
not
say
even
anything
pretty
about
the
gift
of
the
ornament
which
she
put
back
into
the
box
and
carry
away
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
too
be
unhappy
,
as
she
go
on
with
her
plan
-
drawing
,
question
the
purity
of
her
own
feeling
and
speech
in
the
scene
which
have
end
with
that
little
explosion
.
  
<EOS>
Celia
's
consciousness
tell
her
that
she
have
not
be
at
all
in
the
wrong
:
it
be
quite
natural
and
justifiable
that
she
should
have
ask
that
question
,
and
she
repeat
to
herself
that
Dorothea
be
inconsistent
:
either
she
should
have
take
her
full
share
of
the
jewel
,
or
,
after
what
she
have
say
,
she
should
have
renounce
them
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
 
at
least
,
I
trust
,
"
think
Celia
,
"
that
the
wearing
of
a
necklace
will
not
interfere
with
my
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
see
that
I
should
be
bind
by
Dorothea
's
opinion
<EOS>
now
we
be
go
into
society
,
though
of
course
she
herself
ought
to
be
bind
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
be
not
always
consistent
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
Celia
,
mutely
bend
over
her
tapestry
,
until
she
hear
her
sister
call
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Kitty
,
come
and
look
at
my
plan
;
I
shall
think
I
be
a
great
architect

if
I

not

incompatible
stair
and

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
Celia
bent
over
the
paper
,
Dorothea
put
her
cheek
against
her
sister
's
arm
caressingly
.
 
<EOS>
Celia
understand
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
see
that
she
have
be
in
the
wrong

and
Celia
pardon
her
.
 
<EOS>
since
they
could
remember
,
there
have
be
a
mixture
of
criticism
and
awe
in
the
attitude
of
Celia
's
mind
towards
her
eld
sister
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
have
always
wear
a
yoke

there

<EOS>
Dorothea
feel
a
little
more
uneasy
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
dinner
,
the
party
be
small
and
the
room
still
,
these
mote
from
the
mass
of
a
magistrate

fall
too
noticeably
.
 
<EOS>
She
wonder
how
a
man
like
Mr.
Casaubon
would
support
such
triviality
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
,
she
think
,
be
very
dignified
;
the
set
of
his
iron
-
gray
hair
and
his
deep
eye
-
socket
make
him
resemble
the
portrait
of
Locke

He
have
the
spare
form

the
pale
complexion

all

yes

I

have

everything

talk
very

privately

quite
despise

She
have
never

<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
she
have
reflect
that

would
perhaps
not
make
a
husband
happy
who
have
not
her
way
of
look
at
thing

stifle
in

depth

heart

the
feeling
that

religious

comfort

notion
and
scruple

<EOS>
when
Miss

Sir

to

down

her
mode

him
at

offensive

why

<EOS>
He
think
it
probable
that
Miss

like
him

manner
must
be
very
marked
indeed
before
they
cease
to
be
interpret
by
preconception
either
confident

distrustful

<EOS>
She
be
thoroughly
charming
to
him

of
course
he
theorize
a
little
about
his

He
be
make
of
excellent
human
dough

have
the

know
that
his
talent
,
even
if
let
loose
,
would
not
set
the
small
stream
in
the
county
on
fire
:
hence
he
like
the
prospect
of
a
wife
to
whom
he
could
say
,
"
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
about
this
or
that
;
who
could
help
her
husband
out
with
reason
,
and
would
also
have
the
property
qualification
for
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
excessive
religiousness
allege
against
Miss
Brooke
,
he
have
a
very
indefinite
notion
of
what
it
consist
in
,
and
think
that
it
would
die
out
with
marriage

Sir

have
no

that
he

ever
like
to
put
down
the
predominance
of
this
handsome

in
whose
cleverness
he

<EOS>
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
a

<EOS>
Sir

may
not

originate
this
estimate
;
but
a

Providence
furnish
the
limp

with
a

"

good

you

I

then
that

every

<EOS>
"
You
see
how
widely
we
differ

Sir

<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
I
ought
not
to
be
a
perfect
horsewoman

and
so
I
should
never
correspond
to
your

of

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dorothea
look
straight
before
her
,
and
speak
with
cold
brusquerie
,
very
much
with
the
air
of
a
handsome
boy
,
in
amusing
contrast
with
the
solicitous
amiability
of
her
admirer

<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
your
reason

this
cruel

<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
that
you
should
think
horsemanship
wrong

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
possible

I
should

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

why

"
say
Sir

,
in

tender
tone

remonstrance

<EOS>
Mr.

come
up

in

<EOS>
"
Miss

know
that
they
be
apt
to
become
feeble
in
the
utterance

mixed
with

"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
color
with
pleasure
,
and
look
up
gratefully
to
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
man
who
could
understand
the
high
inward
life
,
and
with
whom
there
could
be
some
spiritual
communion
;
nay
,
who
could
illuminate
principle
with
the
wide
knowledge
a
man
whose
learning
almost
amount
to
a
proof
of
whatever
he
believe
!
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
inference
may
seem
large
;
but
really
life
could
never
have
go
on
at
any
period
but
for
this
liberal
allowance
of
conclusion

which
have
facilitate
marriage
under
the
difficulty

have
any

ever
pinch
into

pilulous

the

"
say
good
Sir

<EOS>
"
Miss

shall
not

I
be
sure
her
reason
would
do
her
honor

<EOS>
He
be
not
in
the
least
jealous
of
the
interest
with
which
Dorothea
have
look
up
at
Mr.
Casaubon
:
it
never
occur
to
him
that
a
girl
to
whom
he
be
meditate
an
offer
of
marriage
could
care
for
a
dry
bookworm
towards
fifty
,
except
,
indeed
,
in
a
religious
sort
of
way
,
as
for
a
clergyman
of
some
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
since
Miss
Brooke
have
become
engage
in
a
conversation
with
Mr.
Casaubon
about
the
Vaudois
clergy
,
Sir
James
betook
himself
to
Celia
,
and
talk
to
her
about
her
sister
;
speak
of
a
house
in
town
,
and
ask
whether
Miss
Brooke
dislike
London
.
 
<EOS>
away
from
her
sister
,
Celia
talk
quite
easily
,
and
Sir
James
say
to
himself
that
the
second
Miss
Brooke
be
certainly
very
agreeable
as
well
as
pretty
,
though
not
,
as
some
people
pretend
,
more
clever
and
sensible
than
the
eld
sister
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
have
choose
the
one
who
be
in
all
respect
the
superior
;
and
a
man
naturally
like
to
look
forward
to
have
the
good
.

He
would
be

<EOS>
if
it
have
really
occur
to
Mr.
Casaubon
to
think
of
Miss
Brooke
as
a
suitable
wife
for
him
,
the
reason
that
may
induce
her
to
accept
him
be
already
plant
in
her
mind
,
and
by
the
evening
of
the
next
day
the
reason
have
bud
and
bloom
.
 
<EOS>
for
they
have
have
a
long
conversation
in
the
morning
,
while
Celia
,
who
do
not
like
the
company
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mole
and
sallowness
,
have
escape
to
the
vicarage
to
play
with
the
curate
's
ill

shod
but
merry
child
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
by
this
time
have
look
deep
into
the
ungauged
reservoir
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mind
,
see
reflect
there
in
vague
labyrinthine
extension
every
quality
she
herself
bring
;
have
open
much
of
her
own
experience
to
him
,
and
have
understand
from
him
the
scope
of
his
great
work
,
also
of
attractively
labyrinthine
extent
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
have
be
as
instructive
as
Milton
's
"
affable
archangel
;
"
and
with
something
of
the
archangelic
manner
he
tell
her
how
he
have
undertake
to
show
(
what
indeed
have
be
attempt
before
,
but
not
with
that
thoroughness
,
justice
of
comparison
,
and
effectiveness
of
arrangement
at
which
Mr.
Casaubon
aim
)
that
all
the
mythical
system
or
erratic
mythical
fragment
in
the
world
be
corruption
of
a
tradition
originally
reveal
.
 
<EOS>
have
once
master
the
true
position
and
take
a
firm
foot
there
,
the
vast
field
of
mythical
construction
become
intelligible
,
nay
,
luminous
with
the
reflected
light
of
correspondence
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
gather
in
this
great
harvest
of
truth
be
no
light
or
speedy
work
.
 
<EOS>
His
note
already
make
a
formidable
range
of
volume
,
but
the
crowning
task
would
be
to
condense
these
voluminous
still
-
accumulate
result
and
bring
them
,
like
the
early
vintage
of
hippocratic
book
,
to
fit
a
little
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
in
explain
this
to
Dorothea
,
Mr.
Casaubon
express
himself
nearly
as
he
would
have
do
to
a
fellow
-
student
,
for
he
have
not
two
style
of
talk
at
command
:
it
be
true
that
when
he
use
a
greek
or
latin
phrase
he
always
give
the
English
with
scrupulous
care
,
but
he
would
probably
have
do
this
in
any
case
.
 
<EOS>
a
learned
provincial
clergyman
be
accustomed
to
think
of
his
acquaintance
as
of
"
lord
,
knyghtes
,
and
other
noble
and
worthi
man
,
that
conne
Latyn
but
lytille
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
altogether
captivate
by
the
wide
embrace
of
this
conception
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
something
beyond
the
shallow
of
lady
'
school
literature
:
here
be
a
live
Bossuet
,
whose
work
would
reconcile
complete
knowledge
with
devoted
piety
;
here
be
a
modern
Augustine
who
unite
the
glory
of
doctor
and
saint
.
  
<EOS>
the
sanctity
seem
no
less
clearly
mark
than
the
learning
,
for
when
Dorothea
be
impel
to
open
her
mind
on
certain
theme
which
she
could
speak
of
to
no
one
whom
she
have
before
see
at
Tipton
,
especially
on
the
secondary
importance
of
ecclesiastical
form
and
article
of
belief
compare
with
that
spiritual
religion
,
that
submergence
of
self
in
communion
with
divine
perfection
which
seem
to
her
to
be
express
in
the
good
christian
book
of
widely
distant
age
,
she
find
in
Mr.
Casaubon
a
listener
who
understand
her
at
once
,
who
could
assure
her
of
his
own
agreement
with
that
view
when
duly
temper
with
wise
conformity
,
and
could
mention
historical
example
before
unknown
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
think
with
me
,
"
say
Dorothea
to
herself
,
"
or
rather
,
he
think
a
whole
world
of
which
my
thought
be
but
a
poor
twopenny
mirror
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
feeling
too
,
<EOS>
his
whole
experience
 
<EOS>
what
a

"
  
<EOS>
Miss

argue
from
word
and
disposition
not
less
unhesitatingly
than
other
young
lady
of
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
sign
be
small
measurable
thing
,
but
interpretation
be
illimitable
,
and
in
girl
of
sweet
,
ardent
nature
,
every
sign
be
apt
to
conjure
up
wonder
,
hope
,
belief
,
vast
as
a

and
color
by
a
diffuse
thimbleful
of
matter
in

<EOS>
They
be
not
always
too
grossly
deceive

for
Sinbad
himself
may
have
fall
by
good

luck
on
a
true
description
,
and
wrong
reasoning
sometimes
land
poor
mortal
in
right
conclusion

start
a
long
way
off
the
true
point
,
and
proceed
by
loop
and
zigzag
,
we
now
and
then
arrive
just
where
we
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
because
Miss
Brooke
be
hasty
in
her
trust
,
it
be
not
therefore
clear
that
Mr.
Casaubon
be
unworthy
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
stay
a
little
longer
than
he
have
intend
,
on
a
slight
pressure
of
invitation
from
Mr.

who
offer
no

except
his
own

Mr.

pass
from

to
another
with
a
"
yes

"
and
finally
push
them
all
aside
to

Mr.

wind
up
,
rub
his
thumb
transversely
along
the
edge
of
the
leave
as
he
hold
the
book
forward
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
make
a
dignified
though
somewhat
sad
audience
;
bow
in
the
right
place
,
and
avoid
look
at
anything
documentary
as
far
as
possible
,
without
show
disregard
or
impatience
;
mindful
that
this
desultoriness
be
associate
with
the
institution
of
the
country
,
and
that
the
man
who
take
him
on
this
severe
mental
scamper
be
not
only
an
amiable
host
,
but
a
landholder
and
custo
rotulorum
.
<EOS>
be
his
endurance
aid
also
by
the
reflection
that
Mr.
Brooke
be
the
uncle
of
Dorothea
?
  
<EOS>
certainly
he
seem
more
and
more
bent
on
make
her
talk
to
him
,
on
draw
her
out
,
as
Celia
remark
to
herself
;
and
in
look
at
her
his
face
be
often
light
up
by
a
smile
like
pale
wintry
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
leave
the
next
morning
,
while
take
a
pleasant
walk
with
Miss
Brooke
along
the
gravelled
terrace
,
he
have
mention
to
her
that
he
feel
the
disadvantage
of
loneliness
,
the
need
of
that
cheerful
companionship
with
which
the
presence
of
youth
can
lighten
or
vary
the
serious
toil
of
maturity
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
deliver
this
statement
with
as
much
careful
precision
as
if
he
have
be
a
diplomatic
envoy
whose
word
would
be
attend
with
result
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr.
Casaubon
be
not
use
to
expect
that
he
should
have
to
repeat
or
revise
his
communication
of
a
practical
or
personal
kind
.
 
<EOS>
the
inclination
which
he
have
deliberately
state
on
the
2d
of
October
he
would
think
it
enough
to
refer
to
by
the
mention
of
that
date
;
judging
by
the
standard
of
his
own
memory
,
which
be
a
volume
where
a
vide
supra
could
serve
instead
of
repetition
,
and
not
the
ordinary
long
-
use
blotting
-
book
which
only
tell
of
forget
writing
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
case
Mr.
Casaubon
's
confidence
be
not
likely
to
be
falsify
,
for
Dorothea
hear
and
retain
what
he
say
with
the
eager
interest
of
a
fresh
young
nature
to
which
every
variety
in
experience
be
an
epoch
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
three
o'clock
in
the
beautiful
breezy
autumn
day
when
Mr.
Casaubon
drive
off
to
his
Rectory
at
Lowick
,
only
five
mile
from
Tipton
;
and
Dorothea
,
who
have
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
hurry
along
the
shrubbery
and
across
the
park
that
she
may
wander
through
the
border
wood
with
no
other
visible
companionship
than
that
of
Monk
,
the
Great
St.
Bernard
dog
,
who
always
take
care
of
the
young
lady
in
their
walk
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
rise
before
her
the
girl
's
vision
of
a
possible
future
for
herself
to
which
she
look
forward
with
tremble
hope
,
and
she
want
to
wander
on
in
that
visionary
future
without
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
She
walk
briskly
in
the
brisk
air
,
the
color
rise
in
her
cheek
,
and
her
straw
bonnet
(
which
our
contemporary
may
look
at
with
conjectural
curiosity
as
at
an
obsolete
form
of
basket
)
fall
a
little
backward
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
perhaps
be
hardly
characterize
enough
if
it
be
omit
that
she
wear
her
brown
hair
flatly
braid
and
coil
behind
so
as
to
expose

great
mental
need

not

instruction
comparable

judgment

discursive

with
some
endowment
of
stupidity

conceit

with
such

struggle
in

of
a
narrow

hem
in

a
social
life

seem
nothing

a
labyrinth
of
petty
course

a

into
this

one
that
would
deliver
her
from

girlish
subjection
to

the
freedom

it
to
her
sister
in
any
direct
statement
,
for
that
would
be
lay
herself
open
to
a
demonstration
that
she
be
somehow
or
other
at
war
with
all
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
safe
opportunity
,
she
have
an
indirect
mode
of
make
her
negative
wisdom
tell
upon
Dorothea
,
and
call
her
down
from
her
rhapsodic
mood
by
remind
her
that
people
be
stare
,
not
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Celia
be
not
impulsive
:
what
she
have
to
say
could
wait
,
and
come
from
her
always
with
the
same
quiet
staccato
evenness
.
<EOS>
when
people
talk
with
energy
and
emphasis
she
watch
their
face
and
feature
merely
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
could
understand
how
well
-
breed
person
consent
to
sing
and
open
their
mouth
in
the
ridiculous
manner
requisite
for
that
vocal
exercise
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
many
day
before
Mr.
Casaubon
pay
a
morning
visit
,
on
which
he
be
invite
again
for
the
follow
week
to
dine
and
stay
the
night
.
<EOS>
thus
Dorothea
have
three
more
conversation
with
him
,
and
be
convince
that
her
first
impression
have
be
just
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
all
she
have
<EOS>
at
first
imagine
him
to
be
:
almost
everything
he
have
say
seem
like
a
speciman
from
a
mine
,
or
the
inscription
on
the
door
of
a
museum
which
may
open
on
the
treasure
of
past
age
;
and
this
trust
in
his
mental
wealth
be
all
the
deep
and
more
effective
on
her
inclination
because
it
be
now
obvious
that
his
visit
be
make
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
this
accomplished
man
condescend
to
think
of
a
young
girl
,
and
take
the
pain
to
talk
to
her
,
not
with
absurd
compliment
,
but
with
an
appeal
to
her
understanding
,
and
sometimes
with
instructive
correction
.
 
<EOS>
what
delightful
companionship
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
seem
even
unconscious
that
triviality
exist
,
and
never
hand
round
that
small
-
talk
of
heavy
man
which
be
as
acceptable
as
stale
bride
-
cake
bring
forth
with
an
odor
of
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
of
what
he
be
interested
in
,
or
else
he
be
silent
and
bow
with
sad
civility
.
 
<EOS>
to
Dorothea
this
be
adorable
genuineness
,
and
religious
abstinence
from
that
artificiality
which
use
up
the
soul
in
the
effort
of
pretence
.
 
<EOS>
for
she
look
as
reverently
at
Mr.
Casaubon
's
religious
elevation
above
herself
as
she
do
at
his
intellect
and
learning
.
 
<EOS>
He
assent
to
her
expression
of
devout
feeling
,
and
usually
with
an
appropriate
quotation
;
he
allow
himself
to
say
that
he
have
go
through
some
spiritual
conflict
in
his
youth
;
in
short
,
Dorothea
see
that
here
she
may
reckon
on
understanding
,
sympathy
,
and
guidance
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
 
only
one
 
of
her
favorite
theme
she
be
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
apparently
do
not
care
about
building
cottage
,
and
divert
the
talk
to
the
extremely
narrow
accommodation
which
be
to
be
have
in
the
dwelling
of
the
ancient
Egyptians
,
as
if
to
check
a
too
high
standard
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
be
go
,
Dorothea
dwell
with
some
agitation
on
this
indifference
of
his
;
and
her
mind
be
much
exercise
with
argument
draw
from
the
varying
condition
of
climate
which
modify
human
need
,
and
from
the
admit
wickedness
of
pagan
despot
.
 
<EOS>
Should
she
not
urge
these
argument
on
Mr.
Casaubon
when
he
come
again
?
 
<EOS>
but
further
reflection
tell
her
that
she
be
presumptuous
in
demand
his
attention
to
such
a
subject
;
he
would
not
disapprove
of
her
occupy
herself
with
it
in
leisure
moment
,
as
other
woman
expect
to
occupy
themselves
with
their
dress
and
embroidery
 
would
not
forbid
it
when
 
Dorothea
feel
rather
ashamed
as
she
detect
herself
in
these
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
uncle
have
be
invite
to
go
to
Lowick
to
stay
a
couple
of
day
:
be
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
Mr.
Casaubon
delight
in
Mr.
Brooke
's
society
for
its
own
sake
,
either
with
or
without
document
?
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
that
little
disappointment
make
her
delight
the
more
in
Sir
James
Chettam
's
readiness
to
set
on
foot
the
desire
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
much
oftener
than
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
Dorothea
cease
to
find
him
disagreeable
since
he
show
himself
so
entirely
in
earnest
;
for
he
have
already
enter
with
much
practical
ability
into
Lovegood
's
estimate
,
and
be
charmingly
docile
.
 
<EOS>
She
propose
to
build
a
couple
of
cottage
,
and
transfer
two
family
from
their
old
cabin
,
which
could
then
be
pull
down
,
so
that
new
one
could
be
build
on
the
old
site
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
say
"
exactly
,
"
and
she
bear
the
word
remarkably
well
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
these
man
who
have
so
few
spontaneous
idea
may
be
very
useful
member
of
society
under
good
feminine
direction
,
if
they
be
fortunate
in
choose
their
sister
-
in
-
law
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
say
whether
there
be
or
be
not
a
little
wilfulness
in
her
continue
blind
to
the
possibility
that
another
sort
of
choice
be
in
question
in
relation
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
life
be
just
now
full
of
hope
and
action
:
she
be
not
only
think
of
her
plan
,
but
get
down
learned
book
from
the
library
and
read
many
thing
hastily
(
that
she
may
be
a
little
less
ignorant
in
talk
to
Mr.
Casaubon
)
,
all
the
while
be
visit
with
conscientious
questioning
whether
she
be
not
exalt
these
poor
doing
above
measure
and
contemplate
them
with
that
self

satisfaction
which
be
the
last
doom
of
ignorance
and
folly

shyness

one
of
the

marginal
manuscript
of
Mr.

it
in
as
eagerly
as
she
may
have
take
in
the
scent
of
a
fresh

dry

hot
,
dreary
walk

She

Mr.

fall
into
a
wondrous
mass
of
glowing
dice

and
rub
his
hand
gently
,
look
very
mildly
towards
Dorothea
,
but
with
a
neutral
leisurely
air
,
as
if
he
have
nothing
particular
to

<EOS>
Dorothea
close
her
pamphlet

as
soon
as
she
be
aware
of
her
uncle

usually
she
would
have

"
I
come
back

say
Mr.
Brooke
,
not
as
if
with
any
intention
to
arrest
her
departure
,
but
apparently
from
his
usual
tendency
to
say
what
he
have
say
before

<EOS>
this
fundamental
principle
of
human
speech
be
markedly
exhibit
in
Mr.

"
I

<EOS>
Dorothea
feel
quite
inclined
to
accept
the
invitation

<EOS>
some
time
,
when
her
uncle

easy
way
of
take

to

exasperate

it
be
rather
soothing

She
throw
off
her
mantle

bonnet

sit
down
opposite

him

enjoy
the
glow

lift
up
her
beautiful
hand
for
a
screen

They
be
not
thin

She
seem
to
be

up
in
propitiation
for
her
passionate
desire

to

in
the
unfriendly
medium
of
Tipton

Freshitt
have
issue
in
crying
and
red

bethink
herself
now
of

you
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
the
first
hour
of
meet
you
,
I
have
an
impression
of
your
eminent
and
perhaps
exclusive
fitness
to
supply
that
need
(
<EOS>
connect
,
I
may
say
,
with
such
activity
of
the
affection
as
even
the
preoccupation
of
a
work
too
special
to
be
abdicate
could
not
uninterruptedly
dissimulate
)
;
and
each
succeed
opportunity
for
observation
have
give
the
impression
an
add
depth
by
convince
me
more
emphatically
of
that
fitness
which
I
have
preconceive
,
and
thus
evoke
more
decisively
those
affection
to
which
I
have
but
now
refer
.
 
<EOS>
Our
conversation
have
,
I
think
,
make
sufficiently
clear
to
you
the
tenor
of
my
life
and
purpose
:
a
tenor
unsuite
,
I
be
aware
,
to
the
commoner
order
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
discern
in
you
an
elevation
of
thought
and
a
capability
of
devotedness
,
which
I
have
hitherto
not
conceive
to
be
compatible
either
with
the
early
bloom
of
youth
or
with
those
grace
of
sex
that
may
be
say
at
once
to
win
and
to
confer
distinction
when
combine
,
as
they
notably
be
in
you
,
with
the
mental
quality
above
indicate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
confess
,
beyond
my
hope
to
meet
with
this
rare
combination
of
element
both
solid
and
attractive
,
adapt
to
supply
aid
in
graver
labor
and
to
cast
a
charm
over
vacant
hour
;
and
<EOS>
but
for
the
event
of
my
introduction
to
you
(
which
,
let
me
again
say
,
I
trust
not
to
be
superficially
coincident
with
foreshadowing
need
,
but
providentially
relate
thereto
as
stage
towards
the
completion
of
a
life
's
plan
)
,
I
should
presumably
have
go
on
to
the
last
without
any
attempt
to
lighten
my
solitariness
by
a
matrimonial
union
.
  
<EOS>
such
,
my
dear
Miss
Brooke
,
be
the
accurate
statement
of
my
feeling
;
and
I
rely
on
your
kind
indulgence
in
venture
now
to
ask
you
how
far
your
own
be
of
a
nature
to
confirm
my
happy
presentiment
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
accept
by
you
as
your
husband
and
the
earthly
guardian
of
your
welfare
,
I
should
regard
as
the
high
of
providential
gift
.
 
<EOS>
in
return
I
can
at
least
offer
you
an
affection
hitherto
unwaste
,
and
the
faithful
consecration
of
a
life
which
,
however
short
in
the
sequel
,
have
no
backward
page
whereon
,
if
you
choose
to
turn
them
,
you
will
find
record
such
as
may
justly
cause
you
either
bitterness
or
shame
.
 
<EOS>
I
await
the
expression
of
your
sentiment
with
an
anxiety
which
it
would
be
the
part
of
wisdom
(
be
it
possible
)
to
divert
by
a
more
arduous
labor
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
order
of
experience
I
be
still
young
,
and
in
look
forward
to
an
unfavorable
possibility
I
can
not
but
feel
that
resignation
to
solitude
will
be
more
difficult
after
the
temporary
illumination
of
hope
.
          
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
I
shall
remain
,
                
yours
with
sincere
devotion
,

Dorothea
tremble

she
read
this

then
she
fall
on

bury
her
face
,
and
sob
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
pray
:
under
the
rush
of
solemn
emotion
in
which
thought
become
vague
and
image
float
uncertainly
,
she
could
but
cast
herself
,
with
a
childlike
sense
of
recline
,
in
the
lap
of
a
divine
consciousness
which
sustain
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
remain
in
that
attitude
till
it
be
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
how
could
it
occur
to
her
to
examine
the
letter
,
to
look
at
it
critically
as
a
profession
of
love
?
 
<EOS>
Her
whole
soul
be
possess
by
the
fact
that
a
full
life
be
open
before
her
:
she
be
a
neophyte
about
to
enter
on
a
high
grade
of
initiation
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
have
room
for
the
energy
which
stir
uneasily
under
the
dimness
and
pressure
of
her
own
ignorance
and
the
petty
peremptoriness
of
the
world
's
habit
.
  
<EOS>
now
she
would
be
able
to
devote
herself
to
large
yet
definite
duty
;
now
she
would
be
allow
to
live
continually
in
the
light
of
a
mind
that
she
could
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
this
hope
be
not
unmixed
with
the
glow
of
proud
delight
 
the
joyous
maiden
surprise
that
she
be
choose
by
the
man
whom
her
admiration
have
choose
.
 
<EOS>
all
Dorothea
's
passion
be
transfuse
through
a
mind
struggle
towards
an
ideal
life
;
the
radiance
of
her
transfigure
girlhood
fall
on
the
first
object
that
come
within
its

<EOS>
the

with
which
inclination

heighten
by
those
little

have
rouse

up

her
room
to
answer
Mr.
Casaubon
's
letter

<EOS>
why
should
she
defer
the
answer
?
 
<EOS>
She
write
it
over
three
time
,
not
because
she
wish
to
change
the
wording
,
but
because
her
hand
be
unusually
uncertain
,
and
she
could
not
bear
that
Mr.

should
think
her
handwriting
bad
and
illegible

She
pique
herself
on
write
a

in
which
each

be
distinguishable
without
any

she

more

it

Dorothea

I

but
you
must
have
a
scholar

and
that
sort
of
thing
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
it
lie
a
little
in
our
family

<EOS>
I
have
it
myself
 
<EOS>
that
love
of
knowledge
,
and
go
into
everything
 
a
little
too
much
 
<EOS>
it
take
me
too
far
;
though
that
sort
of
thing
do
not
often
run
in
the
female

line
;
or
it
run
underground
like
the
river

you

out
in

Clever

I
go
a
good
deal

however
,
my

I
have
always
say
that
people
should
do
as
they
like
in
these

up
to
a
certain
point

I
could
not

as
your
guardian

have
consent

a
bad
match

but
Casaubon
stand
well
:
his
position
be
good

I
be
afraid
Chettam
will
be
hurt
,
though
,
and
Mrs.
Cadwallader
will
blame
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
evening
,
of
course
,
Celia
know
nothing
of
what
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
She
attribute
Dorothea
's
abstract
manner
,
and
the
evidence
of
further
cry
since
they
have
get
home
,
to
the
temper
she
have
be
in
about
Sir
James
Chettam
and
the
building
,
and
be
careful
not
to
give
further
offence
:
have
once
say
what
she
want
to
say
,
Celia
have
no
disposition
to
recur
to
disagreeable
subject
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
her
nature
when
a
child
never
to
quarrel
with
any
one
 
only
to
observe
with
wonder
that
they
quarrel
with
her
,
and
look
like
turkey
-
cocks
;
whereupon
she
be
ready
to
play
at
cat
's
cradle
with
them
whenever
they
recover
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
Dorothea
,
it
have
always
be
her
way
to
find
something
wrong
in
her
sister
's
word
,
though
Celia
inwardly
protest
that
she
always
say
just
how
thing
be
,
and
nothing
else
:
she
never
do
and
never
could
put
word
together
out
of
her
own
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
good
of
Dodo
be
,
that
she
do
not
keep
angry
for
long
together
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
though
they
have
hardly
speak
to
each
other
all
the
evening
,
yet
when
Celia
put
by
her
work
,
intend
to
go
to
bed
,
a
proceeding
in
which
she
be
always
much
the
earlier
,
Dorothea
,
who
be
seat
on
a
low
stool
,
unable
to
occupy
herself
except
in
meditation
,
say
,
with
the
musical
intonation
which
in
moment
of
deep
but
quiet
feeling
make
her
speech
like
a
fine
bit
of
recitative
    
"
Celia
,
dear
,
come
and
kiss
me
,
"
hold
her
arm
open
as
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Celia
kneel
down
to
get
the
right
level
and
give
her
little
butterfly
kiss
,
while
Dorothea
encircle
her
with
gentle
arm
and
press
her
lip
gravely
on
each
cheek
in
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
sit
up
,
Dodo
,
you
be
so
pale
to
-
night
:
<EOS>
go
to
bed
soon
,
"
say
Celia
,
in
a
comfortable
way
,
without
any
touch
of
pathos
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
dear
,
I
be
very
,
very
happy

Dorothea
,
fervently
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
,
"
think
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
how
strangely
Dodo
go
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
at
luncheon
,
the
butler
,
hand
something
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
say
,
"
Jonas
be
come
back
,
sir
,
and
have
bring
this
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
read
the
letter
,
and
then
,
nod
toward
Dorothea
,
say
,
"
Casaubon
,
my
dear
:
he
will
be
here
to
dinner
;
he
do
not
wait
to
write
more
 
do
not
wait
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
could
not
seem
remarkable
to
Celia
that
a
dinner
guest
should
be
announce
to
her
sister
beforehand
,
but
,
her
eye
follow
the
same
direction
as
her
uncle
's
,
she
be
strike
with
the
peculiar
effect
of
the
announcement
on
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
something
like
the
reflection
of
a
white
sunlit
wing
have
pass
across
her
feature
,
end
in
one
of
her
rare
blush
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
it
enter
into
Celia
's
mind
that
there
may
be
something
more
between
Mr.
Casaubon
and
her
sister
than
his
delight
in
bookish
talk
and
her
delight
in
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
she
have
class
the
admiration
for
this
"
ugly
"
and
learn
acquaintance
with
the
admiration
for
Monsieur
Liret
at
Lausanne
,
also
ugly
and
learn
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
never
be
tired
of
listen
to
old
Monsieur
Liret
when
Celia
's
foot
be
as
cold
as
possible
,
and
when
it
have
really
become
dreadful
to
see
the
skin
of
his
bald
head
move
about
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
should
her
enthusiasm
not
extend
to
Mr.
Casaubon
simply
in
the
same
way
as
to
Monsieur
Liret
?
 
<EOS>
and
it
seem
probable
that
all
learn
man
have
a
sort
of
schoolmaster
's
view
of
young
people
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
Celia
be
really
startled
at
the
suspicion
which
have
dart
into
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
seldom
take
by
surprise
in
this
way
,
her
marvellous
quickness
in
observe
a
certain
order
of
sign
generally
prepare
her
to
expect
such
outward
event
as
she
have
an
interest
in
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
now
imagine
Mr.
Casaubon
to
be
already
an
accepted
lover
:
she
have
only
begin
to
feel
disgust
at
the
possibility
that
anything
in
Dorothea
's
mind
could
tend
towards
such
an
issue
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
something
really
to
vex
her
about
Dodo
:
it
be
all
very
well
not
to
accept
Sir
James
Chettam
,
but
the
idea
of
marry
Mr.
Casaubon
!
 
<EOS>
Celia
feel
a
sort
of
shame
mingle
with
a
sense
of
the
ludicrous
.
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
dodo
,
if
she
be
really
border
on
such
an
extravagance
,
may
be
turn
away
from
it
<EOS>
:
experience
have
often
show
that
her
impressibility
may
be
calculate
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
damp
,
and
they
be
not
go
to
walk
out
,
so
they
both
go
up
to
their
sitting
-
room
;
and
there
Celia
observe
that
Dorothea
,
instead
of
settle
down
with
her
usual
diligent
interest
to
some
occupation
,
simply
lean
her
elbow
on
an
open
book
and
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
great
cedar
silver
with
the
damp
.
 
<EOS>
She
herself
have
take
up
the
making
of
a
toy
for
the
curate
's
child
,
and
be
not
go
to
enter
on
any
subject
too
precipitately
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
in
fact
think
that
it
be
desirable
for
Celia
to
know
of
the
momentous
change
in
Mr.
Casaubon
's
position
since
he
have
last
be
in
the
house
:
it
do
not
seem
fair
to
leave
her
in
ignorance
of
what
would
necessarily
affect
her
attitude
towards
him
;
but
it
be
impossible
not
to
shrink
from
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
accuse
herself
of
some
meanness
in
this
timidity
:
it
be
always
odious
to
her
to
have
any
small
fear
or
contrivance
about
her
action
,
but
at
this
moment
she
be
seek
the
high
aid
possible
that
she
may
not
dread
the
corrosiveness
of
Celia
's
pretty
carnally
minded
prose
.
 
<EOS>
Her
reverie
be
break
,
and
the
difficulty
of
decision
banish
,
by
Celia
's
small
and
rather
guttural
voice
speak
in
its
usual
tone
,
of
a
remark
aside
or
a
"
by
the
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

any
one
else

Mr.

I

I

I

his

what

there
remarkable
about
his

eating

<EOS>

really
,
Dodo
,
can
not
you
hear
how
he
scrape
his
spoon
?
 
<EOS>
and
he
always
blink
before
he
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
Locke
blink

I
be
sure
I
be
sorry
for
those
who
sit
opposite
to
him

he
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Celia
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
emphatic
gravity
,
"
pray
do
not
make
any
more
observation
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
quite
true

"
return
Celia
,
who
have
her
reason
for
persevere
,
though
she
be
begin
to
be
a
little
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
"
many
thing
be
true
which
only
the
common
mind
observe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
think
the
common
mind
must
be
rather
useful
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
pity
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mother
have
not
a
commoner
mind
:
she
may
have
teach
him
better
.
<EOS>
"
Celia
be
inwardly
frightened
,
and
ready
to
run
away
,
now
she
have
hurl
this
light
javelin
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
feeling
have
gather
to
an
avalanche
,
and
there
could
be
no
further
preparation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
right
to
tell
you
,
Celia
,
that
I
be
engage
to
marry
Mr.
Casaubon
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Celia
have
never
turn
so
pale
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
paper
man
she
be
make
would
have
have
his
leg
injure
,
but
for
her
habitual
care
of
whatever
she
hold
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
the
fragile
figure
down
at
once
,
and
sit
perfectly
still
for
a
few
moment
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
speak
there
be
a
tear
gathering
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Dodo
,
I
hope
you
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
sisterly
tenderness
could
not
but
surmount
other
feeling
at
this
moment
,
and
her
fear
be
the
fear
of
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
still
hurt
and
agitate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
decide
,
then
?
"
say
Celia
,
in
an
awed
under
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
uncle
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
accept
Mr.

's
offer

My

me
the
letter

contain
it

he
know
about
it
beforehand

<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

if
I
have
say
anything
to
hurt
you

Dodo

"
say
Celia
,
with
a
slight
sob
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
could
have
think
that
she
should
feel
as
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
funereal
in
the
whole
affair
,
and
Mr.
Casaubon
seem
to
be
the
officiate
clergyman
,
about
whom
it
would
be
indecent
to
make
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
,
Kitty
,
do
not
grieve
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
never
admire
the
same
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
offend
in
something
of
the
same
way
;
I
be
apt
to
speak
too
strongly
of
those
who
do
not
please
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
this
magnanimity
Dorothea
be
still
smart
:
perhaps
as
much
from
Celia
's
subdued
astonishment
as
from
her
small
criticism
.
<EOS>
of
course
all
the
world
round
Tipton
would
be
out
of
sympathy
with
this
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
know
of
no
one
who
think
as
she
do
about
life
and
its
good
object
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
before
the
evening
be
at
an
end
<EOS>
she
be
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
hour
's
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
Mr.
Casaubon
she
talk
to
him
with
more
freedom
than
she
have
ever
feel
before
,
even
pour
out
her
joy
at
the
thought
of
devote
herself
to
him
,
and
of
learn
how
she
may
best
share
and
further
all
his
great
end
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
be
touch
with
an
unknown
delight
(
what
man
would
not
have
be
?
)
<EOS>
at
this
childlike
unrestrained
ardor
:
he
be
not
surprised
(
what
lover
would
have
be
?
)
<EOS>
that
he
should
be
the
object
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
young
lady
 
Miss
Brooke
 
Dorothea
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
press
her
hand
between
his
hand
,
"
this
be
a
happiness
great
than
I
have
ever
imagine
to
be
in
reserve
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
should
ever
meet
with
a
mind
and
person
so
rich
in
the
mingled
grace
which
could
render
marriage
desirable
,
be
far
indeed
from
my
conception
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
all
 
nay
,
more
than
all
 
those
quality
which
I
have
ever
regard
as
the
characteristic
excellence
of
womanhood
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
charm
of
your
sex
be
its
capability
of
an
ardent
self
-
sacrifice
affection
,
and
herein
we
see
its
fitness
to
round
and
complete
the
existence
of
our
own
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
I
have
know
few
pleasure
save
of
the
severer
kind
:
my
satisfaction
have
be
those
of
the
solitary
student
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
little
disposed
to
gather
flower
that
would
wither
in
my
hand
,
but
now
I
shall
pluck
them
with
eagerness
,
to
place
them
in
your
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
speech
could
have
be
more
thoroughly
honest
in
its
intention
:
the
frigid
rhetoric
at
the
end
be
as
sincere
as
the
bark
of
a
dog
,
or
the
cawing
of
an
amorous
rook
.
 
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
rash
to
conclude
that
there
be
no
passion
behind
those
sonnet
to
Delia
which
strike
us
as
the
thin
music
of
a
mandolin
?
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
faith
supply
all
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
word
seem
to
leave
unsaid
:
what
believer
see
a
disturbing
omission
or
infelicity
?
 
<EOS>
the
text
,
whether
of
prophet
or
of
poet
,
expand
for
whatever
we
can
put
into
it
,
and
even
his
bad
grammar
be
sublime
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
ignorant
 
you
will
quite
wonder
at
my
ignorance
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
many
thought
that
may
be
quite
mistaken
;
and
now
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
them
all
to
you
,
and
ask
you
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
"
she
add
,
with
rapid
imagination
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
probable
feeling
,
"
I
will
not
trouble
you
too
much
;
only
when
you
be
inclined
to
listen
to
me

<EOS>
You
must
often
be
weary
with
the
pursuit
of
subject
in
your
own
track

<EOS>
I
shall
gain
enough
if
you
will
take
me
with
you
there
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
be
able
now
to
persevere
in
any
path
without
your
companionship
?
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
kiss
her
candid
brow
,
and
feeling
that
heaven
have
vouchsafe
him
a
blessing
in
every
way
suit
to
his
peculiar
want

<EOS>
He
be
be
unconsciously
work
upon
by
the
charm
of
a
nature
which
be
entirely
without
hide
calculation
either
for
immediate
effect
or
for
remoter
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
which
make
Dorothea
so
childlike
,
and
,
accord
to
some
judge
,
so
stupid
,
with
all
her
repute
cleverness
;
as
,
for
example
,
in
the
present
case
of
throw
herself
,
metaphorically
speak
,
at
Mr.
Casaubon
's
foot
,
and
kiss
his
unfashionable
shoe
-
tie
as
if
he
be
a
Protestant
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
the
least
teach
Mr.
Casaubon
to
ask
if
he
be
good
enough
for
her
,
but
merely
ask
herself
anxiously
how
she
could
be
good
enough
for
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
leave
the
next
day
it
have
be
decide
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
within
six
week
.
 
<EOS>
why
not
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
's
house
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
parsonage
,
but
a
considerable
mansion
,
with
much
land
attach
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
parsonage
be
inhabit
by
the
curate
,
who
do
all
the
duty
except
preach
the
morning
sermon
.
        
<EOS>
My
lady
's
tongue
be
like
the
meadow
blade
,
    
<EOS>
that
cut
you
stroke
them
with
idle
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Nice
cutting
be
her
function
:
she
divide
    
with
spiritual
edge
the
millet
-
seed
,
    
and
make
intangible
saving
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr.

's
carriage
be
pass
out
of
the
gateway
,
it
arrest
the
entrance
of
a
pony
phaeton
drive
by
a
lady
with
a
servant
seat
behind

It
be
doubtful
whether
the
recognition
have
be
mutual
,
for
Mr.
Casaubon
be
look
absently
before
him
;
but
the
lady
be
quick
-
eyed
,
and
throw
a
nod
and
a
"
how
do
you
do

"
<EOS>
in
the
nick
of
time
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
shabby
bonnet
and
very
old
indian
shawl
,
it
be
plain
that
the
lodge

keeper
regard
her
as
an
important
personage

from
the
low
curtsy

drop
on

entrance

from
which
it

infer
that

would
have
find
the
country

side
somewhat
dull
if
the
Rector

lady
have
be
less
free

spoken

less

<EOS>
indeed
,
both
the
farmer

laborer
in
the
parish
of
Freshitt

Tipton
would
have
feel
a
sad
lack
of
conversation
but
for
the
story
about
what
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
and
do
:
a
lady
of
immeasurably
high
birth
,
descend
,
as
it
be
,
from
unknown
earl
,
dim
as
the
crowd
of
heroic
shade
 
who
plead
poverty
,
pare
down
price
,
and
cut
joke
in
the
most
companionable
manner
,
though
with
a
turn
of
tongue
that
let
you
know
who
she
be

<EOS>
such
a
lady
give
a
neighborliness
to
both
rank

religion

and
mitigate
the
bitterness
of
uncommuted
tithe

<EOS>
a
much
more
exemplary
character

an
infusion
of
sour
dignity
would

be
take

look
silly

relieved

it

safe

,
 
<EOS>
these
be
topic
of
which
she
retain
detail

utmost
accuracy

reproduce
them
in
an
excellent
pickle
of
epigram

which
she
herself
enjoy
the
more
because
she
believe
as
unquestionably
in
birth
and
no
-
birth
as
she
do
in
game
and
vermin
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
never
have
disown
any
one
on
the
ground
of
poverty
:
a
De
Bracy
reduce
to
take
his
dinner
in
a
basin
would
have
seem
to
her
an
example
of
pathos
worth
exaggerating
,
and
I
fear
his
aristocratic
vice
would
not
have
horrify
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
feeling
towards
the
vulgar
rich
be
a
sort
of
religious
hatred
:
they
have
probably
make
all
their
money
out
of
high
retail
price
,
and
Mrs.
Cadwallader
detest
high
price
for
everything
that
be
not
pay
in
kind
at
the
Rectory
:
such
people
be
no
part
of
God
's
design
in
make
the
world
;
and
their
accent
be
an
affliction
to
the
ear
.
 
<EOS>
a
town
where
such
monster
abound
be
hardly
more
than
a
sort
of
low
comedy
,
which
could
not
be
take
account
of
in
a
well

breed
scheme
of
the
universe
.
 
<EOS>
let
any
lady
who
be
incline
to
be
hard
on
Mrs.
Cadwallader
inquire
into
the
comprehensiveness
of
her
own
beautiful
view
,
and
be
quite
sure
that
they
afford
accommodation
for
all
the
life
which
have
the
honor
to
coexist

with
such
a
mind
,
active
as

bite
everything
that
come
near
into
the
form
that
suit
it
,
how
could
Mrs.
Cadwallader
feel
that
the
Miss
Brookes
and
their
matrimonial
prospect
be
alien
to
her
?
<EOS>
especially
as
it
have
be
the
habit
of
year
for
her
to
scold
Mr.
Brooke
with
the
friendly
frankness
,
and
let
him
know
in
confidence
that
she
think
him
a
poor
creature
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
first
arrival
of
the
young
lady
in
Tipton
she
have
prearrange
Dorothea
's
marriage
with
Sir
James
,
and
if
it
have
take
place
would
have
be
quite
sure
that
it
be
her
do
:
<EOS>
that
it
should
not
take
place
after
she
have
preconceive
it
,
cause
her
an
irritation
which
every
thinker
will
sympathize
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
diplomatist
of
Tipton
and
Freshitt
,
and
for
anything
to
happen
in
spite
of
her
be
an
offensive
irregularity
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
freak
like
this
of
Miss
Brooke
's
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
have
no
patience
with
them
,
and
now
see
that
her
opinion
of
this
girl
have
be
infect
with
some
of
her
husband
's
weak
charitableness
:
those
Methodistical
whim
,
that
air
of
be
more
religious
than
the
rector
and
curate
together
,
come
from
a
deep
and
more
constitutional
disease
than
she
have
be
willing
to
believe
.
  
<EOS>
"
however
,
"
say
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
first
to
herself
and
afterwards
to
her
husband
,
"
I
throw
her
over
:
<EOS>
there
be
a
chance

if
she
have
marry
Sir
James
,
of
her
become
a
sane
,
sensible
woman
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
contradict
her
,
and
when
a
woman
be
not
contradict
,
she
have
no
motive
for
obstinacy
in
her
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
wish
her
joy
of
her
hair
shirt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
follow
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
must
decide
on
another
match
for
Sir
James
,
and
have
make
up
her
mind
that
it
be
to
be
the
young
Miss
Brooke
,
there
could
not
have
be
a
more
skilful
move
towards
the
success
of
her
plan
than
her
hint
to
the
baronet
that
he
have
make
an
impression
on
Celia
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
not
one
of
those
gentleman
who
languish
after
the
unattainable
Sappho
's
apple
that
laugh
from
the
topmost
bough
 
<EOS>
the
charm
which
          
"
smile
like
the
knot
of
cowslip
on
the
cliff
,
         
not
to
be
come
at
by
the
willing
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
no
sonnet
to
write
,
and
it
could
not
strike
him
agreeably
that
he
be
not
an
object
of
preference
to
the
woman
whom
he
have
prefer
.
<EOS>
already
the
knowledge
that
Dorothea
have
choose
Mr.
Casaubon
have
bruise
his
attachment
and
relax
its
hold
.
 
<EOS>
although
Sir
James
be
a
sportsman
,
he
have
some
other
feeling
towards
woman
than
towards
grouse
and
fox
,
and
do
not
regard
his
future
wife
in
the
light
of
prey
,
valuable
chiefly
for
the
excitement
of
the
chase
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
he
so
well
acquainted
with
the
habit
of
primitive
race
as
to
feel
that
an
ideal
combat
for
her
,
tomahawk
in
hand
,
so
to
speak
,
be
necessary
to
the
historical
continuity
of
the
marriage
-
tie
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
have
the
amiable
vanity
which
knit
us
to
those
who
be
fond
of
us
,
and
disincline
us
to
those
who
be
indifferent
,
and
also
a
good
grateful
nature
,
the
mere
idea
that
a
woman
have
a
kindness
towards
him
spin
little
thread
of
tenderness
from
out
his
heart
towards
hers
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
,
that
after
Sir
James
have
ride
rather
fast
for
half
an
hour
in
a
direction
away
from
Tipton
Grange
,
he
slacken
his
pace
,
and
at
last
turn
into
a
road
which
would
lead
him
back
by
a
short
cut
.
 
<EOS>
various
feeling
work
in
him
the
determination
after
all
to
go
to
the
Grange
to
-
day
as
if
nothing
new
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
rejoice
that
he
have
never
make
the
offer
and
be
reject
;
mere
friendly
politeness
require
that
he
should
call
to
see
Dorothea
about
the
cottage
,
and
now
happily
Mrs.
Cadwallader
have
prepare
him
to
offer
his
congratulation
,
if
necessary
,
without
show
too
much
awkwardness
.
 
<EOS>
He
really
do
not
like
it
:
give
up
Dorothea
<EOS>
be
very
painful
to
him
;
but
there
be
something
in
the
resolve
to
make
this
visit
forthwith
and
conquer
all
show
of
feeling
,
which
be
a
sort
of
file
-
biting
and
counter
-
irritant
.
<EOS>
and
without
his
distinctly
recognize
the
impulse
,
there
certainly
be
present
in
him
the
sense
that
Celia
would
be
there
,
and
that
he
should
pay
her
more
attention
than
he
have
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
We
mortal
,
man
and
woman
,
devour
many
a
disappointment
between
breakfast
and
dinner

time
;
keep
back
the
tear
and
look
a
little
pale
about
the
lip
,
and
in
answer
to
inquiry
say
,
"
oh

nothing

<EOS>

help
us

and
pride
be
not

Mr.
Casaubon
,
as
may
be
expect
,
spend
a
great
deal
of
his
time
at
the
grange
in
these
week
,
and
the
hindrance
which
courtship
occasion
to
the
progress
of
his
great
work
 
the
Key
to
all
mythology
 
naturally
make
him
look
forward
the
more
eagerly
to
the
happy
termination
of
courtship
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
deliberately
incur
the
hindrance
,
have
make
up
his
mind
that
it
be
now
time
for
him
to
adorn
his
life
with
the
grace
of
female
companionship
,
to
irradiate
the
gloom
which
fatigue
be
apt
to
hang
over
the
interval
of
studious
labor
with
the
play
of
female
fancy
,
and
to
secure
in
this
,
his
culminate
age
,
the
solace
of
female
tendance
for
his
decline
year
.
<EOS>
hence
he
determine
to
abandon
himself
to
the
stream
of
feeling
,
and
perhaps
be
surprised
to
find
what
an
exceedingly
shallow
rill
it
be
.
<EOS>
as
in
droughty
region
baptism
by
immersion
could
only
be
perform
symbolically
,
Mr.
Casaubon
find
that
sprinkling
be
the
utmost
approach
to
a
plunge
which
his
stream
would
afford
him
;
and
he
conclude
that
the
poet
have
much
exaggerate
the
force
of
masculine
passion
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
observe
with
pleasure
that
Miss
Brooke
show
an
ardent
submissive
affection
which
promise
to
fulfil
his
most
agreeable
prevision
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
once
or
twice
cross
his
mind
that
possibly
there
be
some
deficiency
in
Dorothea
to
account
for
the
moderation
of
his
abandonment
;
but
he
be
unable
to
discern
the
deficiency
,
or
to
figure
to
himself
a
woman
who
would
have
please
him
better
;
so
that
there
be
clearly
no
reason
to
fall
back
upon
but
the
exaggeration
of
human
tradition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
I
not
be
prepare
myself
now
to
be
more
useful
?
"
say
Dorothea
to
him
,
one
morning
,
early
in
the
time
of
courtship
;
"
could
I
not
learn
to
read
Latin
and
greek
aloud
to
you
,
as
Milton

without

<EOS>
"
I
fear
that
would
be
wearisome
to

say
Mr.

,
smile
;
"
and
,
indeed
,
if
I
remember
rightly

the

they

teach
themselves
to

then
it

be
interesting

hope
you

to

naughty

stupid

you

certainly
it

copy
the

Dorothea
seize
this
as
a
precious
permission
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
ask
Mr.
Casaubon
at
once
to
teach
her
the
language
,
dread
of
all
thing
to
be
tiresome
instead
of
helpful
;
but
it
be
not
entirely
out
of
devotion
to
her
future
husband
that
she
wish
to
know
Latin
and
Greek
.
 
<EOS>
those
province
of
masculine
knowledge
seem
to
her
a
standing
-
ground
from
which
all
truth
could
be
see
more
truly
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
constantly
doubt
her
own
conclusion
,
because
she
feel
her
own
ignorance
:
how
could
she
be
confident
that
one
-
room
cottage
be
not
for
the
glory
of
God
,
when
man
who
know
the
classic
appear
to
conciliate
indifference
to
the
cottage
with
zeal
for
the
glory
?
<EOS>
perhaps
even
Hebrew
may
be
necessary
 
at
least
the
alphabet
and
a
few
root
 
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
core
of
thing
,
and
judge
soundly
on
the
social
duty
of
the
Christian
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
not
reach
that
point
of
renunciation
at
which
she
would
have
be
satisfied
with
have
a
wise
husband
:
she
wish
,
poor
child
,
to
be
wise
herself

<EOS>
Miss
Brooke
be
certainly
very
naive
with
all
her
alleged
cleverness

<EOS>
Celia
,
whose
mind
have
never
be
think
too
powerful
,
see
the
emptiness
of
other
people
's
pretension
much
more
readily
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
in
general
but
<EOS>
little
feeling
,
seem
to
be
the
only
security
against
feel
too
much
on
any
particular
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Mr.
Casaubon
consent
to
listen
and
teach
for
an
hour
together
,
like
a
schoolmaster
of
little
boy
,
or
rather
like
a
lover
,
to
whom
a
mistress
's
elementary
ignorance
and
difficulty
have
a
touching
fitness
.
 
<EOS>
few
scholar
would
have
dislike
teach
the
alphabet
under
such
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
herself
be
a
little
shocked
and
discourage
at
her
own
stupidity
,
and
the
answer
she
get
to
some
timid
question
about
the
value
of
the
greek
accent
give
her
a
painful
suspicion
that
here
indeed
there
may
be
secret
not
capable
of
explanation
to
a
woman
's
reason
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.

have
no

himself

glad

"
say
Dorothea
,
whose
slight
regard
for
domestic
music
and
feminine
fine
art
must
be
forgive
her
,
consider
the
small
tinkling
and
smearing
in
which
they
chiefly

dark
period

She
smile

He

Mr.

a

an
effect
hardly
tolerable

I

,
after

<EOS>
as
to
the
grander
form
of
music
,
worthy
to
accompany
solemn
celebration
,
and
even
to
serve
as
an
educate
influence
accord
to
the
ancient
conception

nothing

Dorothea

<EOS>
He
end
with
a
smile
,
not
wish
to
hurt
his

but
really
think
that
it
be
perhaps
well
for
her
to
be
early
married
to
so
sober
a
fellow
as
Casaubon
,
since
she
would
not
hear
of
Chettam

be
wonderful
,
though
,

he
say
to
himself
as
he
shuffle
out
of
the
room
 
"
it
be
wonderful
that
she
should
have
like
him

<EOS>

,
the
match
be
good

<EOS>
I
should
have
be
travel
out
of

brief
to
have
hinder
it

let
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
what
she
will
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pretty
certain
to
be
a
bishop
,
be
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
very
seasonable
pamphlet
of
his
on
the
Catholic
Question
:
 
a
deanery
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
They
owe
him
a
deanery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
vindicate
a
claim
to
philosophical
reflectiveness
,
by
remark
that
Mr.
Brooke
on
this
occasion
little
thought
of
the
radical
speech
which
,
at
a
later
period
,
he
be
lead
to
make
on
the
income
of
the
bishop
.
 
<EOS>
what
elegant
historian
would
neglect
a
striking
opportunity
for
point
out
that
his
hero
do
not
foresee
the
history
of
the
world
,
or
even
their
own
action
?
 
<EOS>
for
example
,
that
Henry
of
Navarre
,
when
a
protestant
baby
,
little
thought
of
be
a
catholic
monarch
;
or
that
Alfred
the
Great
,
when
he
measure
his
laborious
night
with
burn
candle
,
have
no
idea
of
future
gentleman
measure
their
idle
day
with
watch
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
mine
of
truth
,
which
,
however
vigorously
it
may
be
work
,
be
likely
to
outlast
our
coal
.
  
<EOS>
but
of
Mr.
Brooke
I
make
a
further
remark
perhaps
less
warrant
by
precedent
 
namely
,
that
if
he
have
foreknow
his
speech
,
it
may
not
have
make
any
great
difference
.
 
<EOS>
to
think
with
pleasure
of
his
niece
's
husband
have
a
large
ecclesiastical
income
be
one
thing
 
to
make
a
liberal
speech
be
another
thing
;
and
it
be
a
narrow
mind
which
can
not
look
at
a
subject
from
various
point
of
view
.
        
<EOS>
"
oh
,
rescue
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
her
brother
now
,
     
<EOS>
and
you
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
every
gentle
maid
     
Should
have
a
guardian
in
each
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
Sir
James
Chettam
<EOS>
how
well
he
continue
to
like
go
to
the
grange
after
he
have
once
encounter
the
difficulty
of
see
Dorothea
for
the
first
time
in
the
light
of
a
woman
who
be
engage
to
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
the
fork
lightning
seem
to
pass
through
him
when
he
first
approach
her
,
and
he
remain
conscious
throughout
the
interview
of
hide
uneasiness
;
but
,
good
as
he
be
,
it
must
be
own
that
his
uneasiness
be
less
than
it
would
have
be
if
he
have
think
his
rival
a
brilliant
and
desirable
match
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
sense
of
be
eclipse
by
Mr.
Casaubon
;
he
be
only
shock
that
Dorothea
be
under
a
melancholy
illusion
,
and
his
mortification
lose
some
of
its
bitterness
by
be
mingle
with
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
while
Sir
James
say
to
himself
that
he
have
completely
resign
her
,
since
with
the
perversity
of
a
Desdemona
she
have
not
affect
a
propose
match
that
be
clearly
suitable
and
accord
to
nature
;
he
could
not
yet
be
quite
passive
under
the
idea
of
her
engagement
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
when
he
first
see
them
together
in
the
light
of
his
present
knowledge
,
it
seem
to
him
that
he
have
not
take
the
affair
seriously
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Brooke
be
really
culpable
;
he
ought
to
have
hinder
it
.
 
<EOS>
who
could
speak
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
something
may
be
do
perhaps
even
now
,
at
least
to
defer
the
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
way
home
he
turn
into
the
Rectory
and
ask
for
Mr.
Cadwallader
.
 
<EOS>
happily
,
the
rector
be
at
home
,
and
his
visitor
be
show
into
the
study
,
where
all
the
fishing
tackle
hang
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
himself
be
in
a
little
room
adjoin
,
at
work
with
his
turn
apparatus
,
and
he
call
to
the
baronet
to
join
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
be
well
friend
than
any
other
landholder
and
clergyman
in
the
county
 
a
significant
fact
which
be
in
agreement
with
the
amiable
expression
of
their
face
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cadwallader
be
a
large
man
,
with
full
lip
and
a
sweet
smile
;
very
plain
and
rough
in
his
exterior
,
but
with
that
solid
imperturbable
ease
and
good
-
humor
which
be
infectious
,
and
like
great
grassy
hill
in
the
sunshine
,
quiet
even
an
irritated
egoism
,
and
make
it
rather
ashamed
of
itself

<EOS>
"

Sir
James

brow
have
a
little
crease
in
it

a
little
depression
of
the
eyebrow

he
seem
purposely
to
exaggerate

answer

"
It

conduct

glad

say
Sir
James

who
,
after
put
down
his
hat
and
throw
himself
into
a
chair

have
begin
to
nurse
his

and
examine

much
bitterness

this
be
Sir
James

strong
way
of
imply
that

think
ill
of

man
's
character

<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
know
against
him

"
say
the
rector
lay
down
his
reel

put
his
thumb
into
his
armhole
with
an
air
of
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
James
pause
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
usually
find
it
easy
to
give
his
reason
:
it
seem
to
him
strange
that
people
should
not
know
them
without
be
tell
,
since
he
only
feel
what
be
reasonable
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
    
"
now
,
Cadwallader
,
have
he
get
any
heart

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

yes

I
do
not

a
sound
kernel

that
_
<EOS>
you
may
be
sure
of

<EOS>
He
be
very
good
to
his
poor
relation
:
<EOS>
pension
several
of
the
woman
,
and
be
educate
a
young
fellow
at
a
good
deal
of
expense
.
 
<EOS>
Casaubon
act
up
to
his
sense
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
's
sister
make
a
bad
match
 
a
Pole
,
I
think
 
lose
herself
 
at
any
rate
be
disown
by
her
family
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
,
Casaubon
would
not
have
have
so
much
money
by
half
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
go
himself
to
find
out
his
cousin
,
and
see
what
he
could
do
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
every
man
would
not
ring
so
well
as
that
,
if
you
try
his

I

I

He
pause
a
moment
,

then
add
,
"
that
be
a
right
thing
for
Casaubon
to
do

<EOS>
but
a
man
may
wish
to
do
what
be
right

be
a
sort

parchment

<EOS>
a

I
think
when

young

her

ought
to
interfere

little
to
hinder
her

it

well

what

I
should
say

on

depend
upon
it

in

<EOS>
I

you

I

<EOS>
Sir

Mrs.
Cadwallader

She

"
well

there
be
something
in

the

It

Brooke
be

my

the

end
with
his
silent
laugh

<EOS>
He
always
see
the
joke
of
any
satire
against
himself
.
 
<EOS>
His
conscience
be
large
and
easy
,
like
the
rest
of
him
:
it
do
only
what
it
could
do
without
any
trouble

<EOS>
clearly
,
there
would
be
no
interference
with
Miss
Brooke
's
marriage
through
Mr.
Cadwallader

and
Sir
James
feel
with
some
sadness
that
she
be
to
have
perfect
liberty
of
misjudgment
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sign
of
his
good
disposition
that
he
do
not
slacken
at
all
in
his
intention
of
carry
out
Dorothea
's
design
of
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
doubtless
<EOS>
this
persistence
be
the
good
course
for
his
own
dignity
:
but
pride
only
help
us
to
be
generous
;
it
never
make
us
so
,
any
more
than
vanity
make
us
witty
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
enough
aware
of
Sir
James
's
position
with
regard
to
her
,
to
appreciate
the
rectitude
of
his
perseverance
in
a
landlord
's
duty
,
to
which
he
have
at
first
be
urge
by
a
lover
's
complaisance
,
and
her
pleasure
in
it
be
great
enough
to
count
for
something
even
in
her
present
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
give
to
Sir
James
Chettam
's
cottage
all
the
interest
she
could
spare
from
Mr.
Casaubon
,
or
rather
from
the
symphony
of
hopeful
dream

admire
trust

passionate
self
devotion

eye
full
of
confidence
to
Mr.

when
he
draw
her
attention
specially
to
some
actual
arrangement
and
ask

like
an
alteration

<EOS>
all
appeal
to
her
taste
she
meet
gratefully

but
see
nothing
to
alter

<EOS>
His
effort
at
exact
courtesy
and
formal
tenderness
have
no
defect
for
her

She

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
kind
of
you
to

of

I
assure
you
I
would
rather
have
all

for

I
shall
be
much
happy
to
take
everything
as
it
be
 
just
as
you

have
it

Mr.

a

<EOS>
the
chair

table
be
thin

easy
to
upset

<EOS>
It
be
a
room
where
one
may
fancy
the
ghost
of
a
tight

laced
lady
revisit
the
scene
of
her
embroidery
.
 
<EOS>
a
light

the

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
she
add
,
look
at
Mr.

perhaps
this

your

room
when
she

young

"
It
be

he

,
with
his
slow
bend

who
have
turn

It

They

the

imply
that
she
think
less
favorably
of
Mr.

<EOS>
It
be
a
new
opening
to
Celia

that
he
come
of
a

have
all

It

those

all
the
powdered
curl
hang
backward
.
<EOS>
altogether
it
seem
to
me
peculiar
rather
than
pretty

<EOS>
there
be
not
even
a

likeness
between
her

your

no

You

My

I
never

<EOS>
Dorothea
wonder
a
little
,
but
feel
that
it
would
be
indelicate
just
then
to
ask
for
any
information
which
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
proffer
,
and
she
turn
to
the
window
to
admire
the
view

<EOS>
the
sun
have
lately
pierce
the
gray
,

"
Shall
we
not
walk
in
the
garden
now
?
"

Dorothea

"
and
you

to
see
the

Mr.

It

It
all
lie
in
a
nut

shell

<EOS>
by
the
way
,
it
will
suit
you

Dorothea

for
the
cottage
be
like
a

house
 
<EOS>
little
garden

gilly

that

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

please

"
say
Dorothea
,
look
at
Mr.

,
"
I
should
like
to
see
all
that

<EOS>
"
She
have
get
nothing
from
him
more
graphic
about
the
Lowick
cottage

that
they

<EOS>
They
be
soon
on
a
gravel
walk
which
lead
chiefly
between
grassy
border
and
clump
of
tree
,
this
be
the
near
way
to
the
church
,
Mr.

say
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
little
gate
lead
into
the
churchyard
there
be
a
pause
while
Mr.

go
to
the
parsonage
close
by
to
fetch
a
key

<EOS>
Celia
,
who
have
be
hang
a

in

come
up
presently
,
when
she
see
that
Mr.

be
go
away
,
and
say
in
her
easy
staccato
,
which
always
seem
to
contradict
the
suspicion
of
any
malicious
intent
    
"
do
you
know

Dorothea

I
see
some
one
quite
young

there

Mr.

I
tell

he
should
change

<EOS>
"
  
"
no

not
a
gardener

"
say
Celia
;
"
a
gentleman
with
a
sketch

book

<EOS>
He
have
light
-
brown
curl

<EOS>
I
only
see
his
back

he
be
quite
young

<EOS>
"
the
curate

son
,
perhaps
,
"
say
Mr.

.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
there
be
Casaubon
again
,
and
Tucker
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
introduce
Tucker
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tucker
be
the
middle

aged
curate

one
of
the
"
inferior
clergy
,
"
who
be
usually
not
want
in
son

<EOS>
but
after
the
introduction
,
the
conversation
do
not
lead
to
any
question
about
his
family
,
and
the
startling
apparition
of
youthfulness
be
forget
by
every
one
but
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
She
inwardly
decline
to
believe
that
the
light
-
brown
curl
and
slim
figure
could
have
any
relationship
to
Mr.
Tucker
,
who
be
just
as
old
and
musty
-
look
as
she
would
have
expect
Mr.
Casaubon
's
curate
to
be
;
doubtless
an
excellent
man
who
would
go
to
heaven
(
for
Celia
wish
not
to
be
unprinciple
)
,
but
the
corner
of
his
mouth
be
so
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
Celia
think
with
some
dismalness
of
the
time
she
should
have
to
spend
as
bridesmaid
at
Lowick
,
while
the
curate
have
probably
no
pretty
little
child
whom
she
could
like
,
irrespective
of
principle
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tucker
be
invaluable
in
their
walk
;
and
perhaps
Mr.
Casaubon
have
not
be
without
foresight
on
this
head
,
the
curate
be
able
to
answer
all
Dorothea
's
question
about
the
villager
and
the
other
parishioner
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
,
he
assure
her
,
be
well
off
in
Lowick
:
not
a
cottager
in
those
double
cottage
at
a
low
rent
but
keep
a
pig
,
and
the
strip
of
garden
at
the
back
be
well
tended
.
 
<EOS>
the
small
boy
wear
excellent
corduroy
,
the
girl
go
out
as
tidy
servant
,
or
do
a
little
straw
-
plait
at
home
:
<EOS>
no
loom
here
,
no
Dissent
;
and
though
the
public
disposition
be
rather
towards
lay
by
money
than
towards
spirituality
,
there
be
not
much
vice
.
 
<EOS>
the
speckled
fowl
be
so
numerous
that
Mr.
Brooke
observe
,
"
Your
farmer
leave
some
barley
for
the

to
glean

I
see

<EOS>
the
poor
folk
here

indignantly

be

such
monster

if
he
wish
them
a
skinny
fowl
,
"
say
Celia
,
"
that
would
not
be
nice

<EOS>
but
perhaps
he
wish
them
to
have
fat
fowl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
the
word
have
drop
out
of
the
text
,
or
perhaps
be
subauditum
;
that
is
,
present
in
the
king
's
mind
,
but
not
utter
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
smile
and
bend
his
head
towards
Celia
,
who
immediately
drop
backward
a
little
,
because
she
could
not
bear
Mr.
Casaubon
to
blink
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
sink
into
silence
on
the
way
back
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
some
disappointment
,
of
which
she
be
yet
ashamed
,
that
there
be
nothing
for
her
to
do
in
Lowick
;
and
in
the
next
few
minute
her
mind
have
glance
over
the
possibility
,
which
she
would
have
prefer
,
of
find
that
her
home
would
be
in
a
parish
which
have
a
large
share
of
the
world
's
misery
,
so
that
she
may
have
have
more
active
duty
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
recur
to
the
future
actually
before
her
,
she
make
a
picture
of
more
complete
devotion
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
aim
in
which
she
would
await
new
duty
.
 
<EOS>
many
such
may
reveal
themselves
to
the
high
knowledge
gain
by
her
in
that
companionship
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tucker
soon
leave
them
,
have
some
clerical
work
which
would
not
allow
him
to
lunch
at
the
Hall
;
and
as
they
be
re
-
enter
the
garden
through
the
little
gate
,
Mr.

say
    
"
You

Dorothea

with
her
usual
openness

"
I
be
no
judge
of

not
coldly
,

with
an
eager
deprecation
of
the
appeal
to
her

You
know
,
uncle

I
never
see
the
beauty
of
those

you

so
much
praise

<EOS>
They
be
a
language
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
some
relation
between

I
be
too
ignorant

nonchalantly

me

how
different

you

the

so
on

you
take
to

kind
of

You
will
come
to
my

I
hope

I
will
show
you
what
I
do

,
turn
to
young
Ladislaw
,
who
have
to
be
recall
from
his
preoccupation
in
observe
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
have
make
up
his
mind
that
she
must
be
an
unpleasant
girl
,
since
she
be
go
to
marry
Casaubon
,
and
what
she
say
of
her
stupidity
about
picture
would
have
confirm
that
opinion
even
if
he
have
believe
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
take
her
word
for
a
covert
judgment
,
and
be
certain
that
she
think
his
sketch
detestable
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
too
much
cleverness
in
her
apology
:
she
be
laugh
both
at
her
uncle
and
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
a
voice
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
voice
of
a
soul
that
have
once
live
in
an
aeolian
harp
.
 
<EOS>
this
must
be
one
of
Nature
's
inconsistency
.
 
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
sort
of
passion
in
a
girl
who
would
marry
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
turn
from
her
,
and
bow
his
thank
for
Mr.
Brooke
's
invitation

<EOS>
"
We
will
turn
over
my

<EOS>
"
that
be
a
seasonable
admonition

Mr.

now
we
will

his

break
into
an
expression
of
amusement

increase
as

go
on
drawing

till
at
last
he
throw
back
his

laugh
aloud

<EOS>
partly
it
be
the
reception
of
his
own
artistic
production
that
tickle
him
;
partly
the
notion
of
his
grave
cousin
as
the
lover
of
that
girl
;
and
partly
Mr.
Brooke
's
definition
of
the
place
he
may
have
hold

for
the
impediment
of
indolence

<EOS>
Mr.
Will
Ladislaw
's
sense
of
the
ludicrous
lit
up
his
feature
very
agreeably
:
it
be
the
pure
enjoyment
of
comicality
,

have
no
mixture
of
sneering
and
self

exaltation

yes

the
answer
to
that
question

painfully
doubtful

<EOS>
on

Rugby
he
decline
to
go
to
an
english
university
,
where
I
would
gladly
have
place
him
,
and
choose
what
I
must
consider
the
anomalous
course
of
study
at
Heidelberg
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
want
to
go
abroad
again
,
without
any
special
object
,
save
the
vague
purpose
of
what
he
call
culture
,
preparation
for
he
know
not
what
.
 
<EOS>
He
decline
to
choose
a
profession

He

no

I
have
always
give
him

him
with

I
be
-
therefore
bind
to
fulfil
the
expectation
so
raise
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
put
his
conduct
in
the
light
of
mere
rectitude
:
a
trait
of
delicacy
which
Dorothea
notice
with
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
thirst
for
travel
;
perhaps
he
may
turn
out
a
Bruce
or
a
Mungo
Park
,
"
say
Mr.
Brooke
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
notion
of
that
myself

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
have
no
bent
towards
exploration

that
would

without

him
on

so
often
end

violent
death

so
far
be
he
from

any

he

Mr.

certainly
an
impartial
mind

<EOS>
"
It
be
,
I
fear
,
nothing
more
than
a
part
of
his
general
inaccuracy
and
indisposition
to
thoroughness
of
all
kind
,
which
would
be
a
bad
augury
for
him
in
any
profession

civil
or
sacred
,
even
be
he
so
far
submissive
to
ordinary
rule
as
to
choose
one

<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
have
conscientious
scruple
found
on
his
own
unfitness

"
say
Dorothea
,
who
be
interesting
herself
in
find
a
favorable
explanation

serious

doubtless
;
but
I
fear
that
my
young
relative
Will
Ladislaw
be
chiefly
determine
in
his
aversion
to
these
calling
by
a
dislike
to
steady
application

and
to
that
kind
of
acquirement
which
be
needful
instrumentally
,
but
be
not
charming

immediately

to
self

indulgent
taste

<EOS>
I
have
insist
to
him
on
what
Aristotle
have
state
with
admirable
brevity

that
for
the
achievement

as
an
end

must

energy

<EOS>
Young
Ladislaw
do
not
pay
that
visit
to
which
Mr.

have
invite
him
,
and
only
six
day
afterwards
Mr.
Casaubon
mention
that
his
young
relative
have
start
for
the
Continent
,
seem
by
this
cold
vagueness
to
waive
inquiry

<EOS>
indeed
,
Will
have
decline
to
fix
on
any
more
precise
destination
than
the
entire
area
of
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
Genius
,
he
hold
,
be
necessarily
intolerant
of
fetter
:
on
the
one
hand
it
must
have
the
utmost
play
for
its
spontaneity
;
on
the
other
,
it
may
confidently
await
those
message
from
the
universe
which
summon
it
to
its
peculiar
work
,
only
place
itself
in
an
attitude
of
receptivity
towards
all
sublime
chance

<EOS>
the
attitude
of
receptivity
be
various
,
and
Will
have
sincerely
try
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
excessively
fond
of
wine
,
but
he
have
several
time
take
too
much
,
simply
as
an
experiment
in
that
form
of
ecstasy
;
he
have
fast
till
he
be
faint
,
and
then
sup
on
lobster
;
he
have
make
himself
ill
with
dose
of
opium
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
greatly
original
have
result
from
these
measure
;
and
the
effect
of
the
opium
have
convince
him
that
there
be
an
entire
dissimilarity
between
his
constitution
and
De
Quincey
's
.
<EOS>
the
superadde
circumstance
which
would
evolve
the
genius
have
not
yet
come
;
the
universe
have
not
yet
beckon
.
<EOS>
even
Caesar
's
fortune
at
one
time
be
,
but
a
grand
presentiment
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
what
a
masquerade
all
development
be
,
and
what
effective
shape
may
be
disguise
in
helpless
embryo
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
world
be
full
of
hopeful
analogy
and
handsome
dubious
egg
call
possibility
.
 
<EOS>
Will
see
clearly
enough
the
pitiable
instance
of
long
incubation
produce
no
chick
,
and
but
for
gratitude
would
have
laugh
at
Casaubon
,
whose
plod
application
,
row
of
note
-
book
,
and
small
taper
of
learn
theory
explore
the
tossed
ruin
of
the
world
,
seem
to
enforce
a
moral
entirely
encouraging
to
Will
's
generous
reliance
on
the
intention
of
the
universe
with
regard
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
that
reliance
to
be
a
mark
of
genius
;
and
certainly
it
be
no
mark
to
the
contrary
;
genius
consist
neither
in
self
-
conceit
nor
in
humility
,
but
in
a
power
to
make
or
do
,
not
anything
in
general
,
but
something
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
start
for
the
Continent
,
then
,
without
our
pronouncing
on
his
future
.
 
<EOS>
among
all
form
of
mistake
,
prophecy
be
the
most
gratuitous
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
present
this
caution
against
a
too
hasty
judgment
interest
me
more
in
relation
to
Mr.
Casaubon
than
to
his
young
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
if
to
Dorothea
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
have
be
the
mere
occasion
which
have
set
<EOS>
alight
the
fine
inflammable
material
of
her
youthful
illusion
<EOS>
,
do
it
follow
that
he
be
fairly
represent
in
the
mind
of
those
less
impassioned
personage
who
have
hitherto
deliver
their
judgment
concern
him
?
<EOS>
I
protest
against
any
absolute
conclusion
,
any
prejudice
derive
from
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
contempt
for
a
neighbor
clergyman
's
allege
greatness
of
soul
,
or
Sir
James
Chettam
's
poor
opinion
of
his
rival
's
leg
,
 
from
Mr.
Brooke
's
failure
to
elicit
a
companion
's
idea
,
or
from
Celia
's
criticism
of
a
middle
-
aged
scholar
's
personal
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
the
great
man
of
his
age
,
if
ever
that
solitary
superlative
exist
,
could
escape
these
unfavorable
reflection
of
himself
in
various
small
mirror
;
and
even
Milton
,
look
for
his
portrait
in
a
spoon
,
must
submit
to
have
the
facial
angle
of
a
bumpkin
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
if
Mr.
Casaubon
,
speak
for
himself
,
have
rather
a
chill
rhetoric
,
it
be
not
therefore
certain
that
there
be
no
good
work
or
fine
feeling
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
an
immortal
physicist
and
interpreter
of
hieroglyph
write
detestable
verse
?
 
<EOS>
have
the
theory
of
the
solar
system
be
advance
by
graceful
manner
and
conversational
tact
?
<EOS>
suppose
we
turn
from
outside
estimate
of
a
man
,
to
wonder
,
with
keener
interest
,
what
be
the
report
of
his
own
consciousness
about
his
doing
or
capacity
:
with
what
hindrance
he
be
carry
on
his
daily
labor
;
what
fade
of
hope
,
or
what
deep
fixity
of
self
-
delusion
the
year
be
mark
off
within
him
;
and
with
what
spirit
he
wrestle
against
universal
pressure
,
which
will
one
day
be
too
heavy
for
him
,
and
bring
his
heart
to
its
final
pause
.
 
<EOS>
doubtless
his
lot
be
important
in
his
own
eye
;
and
the
chief
reason
that
we
think
he
ask
too
large
a
place
in
our
consideration
must
be
our
want
of
room
for
him
,
since
we
refer
him
to
the
Divine
regard
with
perfect
confidence
;
nay
,
it
be
even
hold
sublime
for
our
neighbor
to
expect
the
utmost
there
,
however
little
he
may
have
get
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
,
too
,
be
the
centre
of
his
own
world
;
if
he
be
liable
to
think
that
other
be
providentially
make
for
him
,
and
especially
to
consider
them
in
the
light
of
their
fitness
for
the
author
of
a
"
key
to
all
Mythologies
,
"
this
trait
be
not
quite
alien
to
us
,
and
,
like
the
other
mendicant
hope
of
mortal
,
claim
some
of
our
pity
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
this
affair
of
his
marriage
with
Miss
Brooke
touch
him
more
nearly
than
it
do
any
one
of
the
person
who
have
hitherto
show
their
disapproval
of
it
,
and
in
the
present
stage
of
thing
I
feel
more
tenderly
towards
his
experience
of
success
than
towards
the
disappointment
of
the
amiable
Sir
James
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
truth
,
as
the
day
fix
for
his
marriage
come
nearer
,
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
find
his
spirit
rise
;
nor
do
the
contemplation
of
that
matrimonial
garden
scene
,
where
,
as
all
experience
show
,
the
path
be
to
be
border
with
flower
,
prove
persistently
more
enchanting
to
him
than
the
accustomed
vault
where
he
walk
taper
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
confess
to
himself
,
<EOS>
still
less
could
he
have
breathe
to
another
,
his
surprise
that
though
he
have
win
a
lovely
and
noble
-
hearted
girl
he
have
not
win
delight
,
 
which
he
have
also
regard
as
an
object
to
be
find
by
search
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
know
all
the
classical
passage
imply
the
contrary
;
but
know
classical
passage
,
we
find
,
be
a
mode
of
motion
,
which
explain
why
they
leave
so
little
extra
force
for
their
personal
application
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
have
imagine
that
his
long
studious
bachelorhood
have
store
up
for
him
a
compound
interest
of
enjoyment
,
and
that
large
draft
on
his
affection
would
not
fail
to
be
honor
;
for
we
all
of
us
,
grave
or
light
,
get
our
thought
entangle
in
metaphor
,
and
act
fatally
on
the
strength
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
be
in
danger
of
be
sadden
by
the
very
conviction
that
his
circumstance
be
unusually
happy
:
there
be
nothing
external
by
which
he
could
account
for
a
certain
blankness
of
sensibility
which
come
over
him
just
when
his
expectant
gladness
should
have
be
most
lively
,
just
when
he
exchange
the
accustomed
dulness
of
his
Lowick
library
for
his
visit
to
the
Grange
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
weary
experience
in
which
he
be
as
utterly
condemn
to
loneliness
as
in
the
despair
which
sometimes
threaten
him
while
toil
in
the
morass
of
authorship
without
seem
nearer
to
the
goal
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
be
that
bad
loneliness
which
would
shrink
from
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
wish
that
Dorothea
should
think
him
not
less
happy
than
the
world
would
expect
her
successful
suitor
to
be
;
and
in
relation
to
his
authorship
he
lean
on
her
young
trust
and
veneration
,
he
like
to
draw
forth
her
fresh
interest
in
listening
,
as
a
means
of
encouragement
to
himself
:
in
talk
to
her
<EOS>
he
present
all
his
performance
and
intention
with
the
reflect
confidence
of
the
pedagogue
,
and
rid
himself
for
the
time
of
that
chill
ideal
audience
which
crowd
his
laborious
uncreative
hour
with
the
vaporous
pressure
of
Tartarean
shade
.
  
<EOS>
for
to
Dorothea
,
after
that
toy
-
box
history
of
the
world
adapt
to
young
lady
which
have
make
the
chief
part
of
her
education
,
Mr.
Casaubon
's
talk
about
his
great
book
be
full
of
new
vista
;
and
this
sense
of
revelation
,
this
surprise
of
a
near
introduction
to
Stoics
and
Alexandrians
,
as
people
who
have
idea
not
totally
unlike
her
own
,
keep
in
abeyance
for
the
time
her
usual
eagerness
for
a
bind
theory
which
could
bring
her
own
life
and
doctrine
into
strict
connection
with
that
amazing
past
,
and
give
the
remote
source
of
knowledge
some
bearing
on
her
action
.
 
<EOS>
that
more
complete
teaching
would
come
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
would
tell
her
all
that
:
she
be
look
forward
to
high
initiation
in
idea
,
as
she
be
look
forward
to
marriage
,
and
blend
her
dim
conception
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
Dorothea
would
have
care
about
any
share
in
Mr.
Casaubon
's
learning
as
mere
accomplishment
;
for
though
opinion
in
the
neighborhood
of
Freshitt
and
Tipton
have
pronounce
her
clever
,
that
epithet
would
not
have
describe
her
to
circle
in
whose
more
precise
vocabulary
cleverness
imply
mere
aptitude
for
know
and
do
,
apart
from
character
.
 
<EOS>
all
her
eagerness
for
acquirement
lie
within
that
full
current
of
sympathetic
motive
in
which
her
idea
and
impulse
be
habitually
sweep
along
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
want
to
deck
herself
with
knowledge
 
to
wear
it
loose
from
the
nerve
and
blood
that
feed
her
action
;
and
if
she
have
write
a
book
she
must
have
do
it
as
Saint
Theresa
do
,
under
the
command
of
an
authority
that
constrain
her
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
but
something
she
yearn
for
by
which
her
life
may
be
fill
with
action
at
once
rational
and
ardent
;
and
since
the
time
be
go
by
for
guide
vision
and
spiritual
director
,
since
prayer
heighten
yearning
but
not
instruction
,
what
lamp
be
there
but
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
surely
learn
man
keep
the
only
oil
;
and
who
more
learn
than
Mr.
Casaubon
?
  
<EOS>
thus
in
these
brief
week
Dorothea
's
joyous
grateful
expectation
be
unbroken
,
and
however
her
lover
may
occasionally
be
conscious
of
flatness
,
he
could
never
refer
it
to
any
slackening
of
her
affectionate
interest
.
  
<EOS>
the
season
be
mild
enough
to
encourage
the
project
of
extend
the
wedding
journey
as
far
as
Rome
,
and
Mr.
Casaubon
be
anxious
for
this
because
he
wish
to
inspect
some
manuscript
in
the
Vatican
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
still
regret
that
your
sister
be
not
to
accompany
us
,
"
he
say
one
morning
,
some
time
after
it
have
be
ascertain
that
Celia
object
to
go
,
and
that
Dorothea
do
not
wish
for
her
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
many
lonely
hour
,
Dorotheas
,
for
I
shall
be
constrain
to
make
the
utmost
use
of
my
time
during
our
stay
in
Rome
,
and
I
should
feel
more
at
liberty
if
you
have
a
companion
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
"
I
should
feel
more
at
liberty
"
grate
on
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
speak
to
Mr.
Casaubon
she
color
from
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
misunderstood
me
very
much
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
you
think
I
should
not
enter
into
the
value
of
your
time
 
if
you
think
that
I
should
not
willingly
give
up
whatever
interfere
with
your
use
it
to
the
good
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
amiable
in
you
,
my
dear
Dorothea
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
not
in
the
least
noticing
that
she
be
hurt
;
"
but
if
you
have
a
lady
as
your
companion
,
I
could
put
you
both
under
the
care
of
a
cicerone
,
and
we
could
thus
achieve
two
purpose
in
the
same
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
will
not
refer
to
this
again
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
rather
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
but
immediately
she
fear
that
she
be
wrong
,
and
turn
towards
him
she
lay
her
hand
on
his
,
add
in
a
different
tone
,
"
pray
do
not
be
anxious
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
so
much
to
think
of
when
I
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
and
Tantripp
will
be
a
sufficient
companion
,
just
to
take
care
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
have
Celia
:
she
would
be
miserable
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
time
to
dress
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
a
dinner
-
party
that
day
,
the
last
of
the
party
which
be
hold
at
the
grange
as
proper
preliminary
to
the
wedding
,
and
Dorothea
be
glad
of
a
reason
for
move
away
at
once
on
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
as
if
she
need
more
than
her
usual
amount
of
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
of
be
irritate
from
some
cause
<EOS>
she
could
not
define
even
to
herself
;
for
though
she
have
no
intention
to
be
untruthful
,
her
reply
have
not
touch
the
real
hurt
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
's
word
have
be
quite
reasonable
,
yet
they
have
bring
a
vague
instantaneous
sense
of
aloofness
on
his
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
I
be
in
a
strangely
selfish
weak
state
of
mind
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
have
a
husband
who
be
so
much
above
me
without
know
that
he
need
me
less
than
I
need
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
have
convince
herself
that
Mr.
Casaubon
be
altogether
right
,
she
recover
her
equanimity
,
and
be
an
agreeable
image
of
serene
dignity
when
she
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
in
her
silver
-
gray
dress
 
the
simple
line
of
her
dark
-
brown
hair
part
over
her
brow
and
coil
massively
behind
,
in
keep
with
the
entire
absence
from
her
manner
and
expression
of
all
search
after
mere
effect
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
when
Dorothea
be
in
company
,
there
seem
to
be
as
complete
an
air
of
repose
about
her
as
if
she
have
be
a
picture
of
Santa
Barbara
look
out
from
her
tower
into
the
clear
air
;
but
these
interval
of
quietude
make
the
energy
of
her
speech
and
emotion
the
more
remarked
when
some
outward
appeal
have
touch
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
naturally
the
subject
of
many
observation
this
evening
,
for
the
dinner
-
party
be
large
and
rather
more
miscellaneous
as
to
the
male
portion
than
any
which
have
be
hold
at
the
Grange
since
Mr.
Brooke
's
niece
have
reside
with
him
,
so
that
the
talking
be
do
in
duos
and
trio
more
or
less
inharmonious
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
newly
elect
mayor
of
Middlemarch
,
who
happen
to
be
a
manufacturer
;
the
philanthropic
banker
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
who
predominate
so
much
in
the
town
that
some
call
him
a
Methodist
,
other
a
hypocrite
,
accord
to
the
resource
of
their
vocabulary
;
and
there
be
various
professional
man
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
that
Brooke
be
begin
to
treat
the
Middlemarchers
,
and
that
she
prefer
the
farmer
at
the
tithe
-
dinner
,
who
drink
her
health
unpretentiously
,
and
be
not
ashamed
of
their
grandfather
'
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
before
reform
have
do
its
notable
part
in
develop
the
political
consciousness
,
there
be
a
clear
distinction
of
rank
and
a
dimmer
distinction
of
party
;
so
that
Mr.
Brooke
's
miscellaneous
invitation
seem
to
belong
to
that
general
laxity
which
come
from
his
inordinate
travel
and
habit
of
take
too
much
in
the
form
of
idea
.
  
<EOS>
already
,
as
Miss
Brooke
pass
out
of
the
dining
-
room
,
opportunity
be
find
for
some
interjectional
"
aside
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
fine
woman
,
Miss
Brooke
!
<EOS>
an
uncommonly
fine
woman
,
by
God
!
"
say
Mr.
Standish
,
the
old
lawyer
,
who
have
be
so
long
concerned
with
the
landed
gentry
that
he
have
become
land
himself
,
and
use
that
oath
in
a
deep
-
mouthed
manner
as
a
sort
of
armorial
bearing
,
stamp
the
speech
of
a
man
who
hold
a
good
position
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
the
banker
,
seem
to
be
address
,
but
that
gentleman
dislike
coarseness
and
profanity
,
and
merely
bow
.
 
<EOS>
the
remark
be
take
up
by
Mr.
Chichely
,
a
middle
-
aged
bachelor
and
course
celebrity
,
who
have
a
complexion
something
like
an
Easter
egg
,
a
few
hair
carefully
arrange
,
and
a
carriage
imply
the
consciousness
of
a
distinguished
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
not
my
style
of
woman
:
I
like
a
woman
who
lay
herself
out
a
little
more
to
please
us
.
 
<EOS>
there
should
be
a
little
filigree
about
a
woman
 
something
of
the
coquette

<EOS>
a

a
sort
of
challenge

there
be
some
truth
in
that

say
Mr.
Standish
,
dispose
to
be
genial

<EOS>
and
,
by
God
,
it
be
usually
the
way
with
them

<EOS>
I
suppose
it

some
wise
end

:
Providence

them
so

<EOS>

I
should

dispose
to

coquetry
to
another

Mr.
Bulstrode

<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
refer
it
to
the
devil

<EOS>
"
ay
,
to
be
sure
,
there
should
be
a
little
devil
in
a
woman

"
say
Mr.
Chichely
,
whose
study
of
the
fair
sex
seem
to
have
be
detrimental
to
his
theology

I
like

swan
neck

between
ourselves

the
mayor

"
well

Mr.

jocosely

Mr.

the

He
do
not
approve

reckless
cupping

whose
youthful

,
with
her
approach
marriage

evidently
Miss

be
not

any
more

consider

Lydgate
be

lydgate
,
in
fact

be
already
conscious
of
be
fascinate
by
a
woman
strikingly
different
from
Miss
Brooke
:
he
do
not
in
the
least
suppose
that
he
have
lose
his
balance
and
fall
in
love
,
but
he
have
say
of
that
particular
woman
,
"
She
be
grace
itself
;
she
be
perfectly
lovely
and
accomplished
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
a
woman
ought
to
be
:
she
ought
to
produce
the
effect
of
exquisite
music

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
plain
woman
he
regard
as
he
do
the
other
severe
fact
of
life
,
to
be
face
with
philosophy
and
investigate
by
science
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
Vincy
seem
to
have
the
true
melodic
charm
;
and
when
a
man
have
see
the
woman
whom
he
would
have
choose
if
he
have
intend
to
marry
speedily
,
his
remain
a
bachelor
will
usually
depend
on
her
resolution
rather
than
on
his
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
believe
that
he
should
not
marry
for
several
year
:
not
marry
until
he
have
tread
out
a
good
clear
path
for
himself
away
from
the
broad
road
which
be
quite
ready
make
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
Miss
Vincy
above
his
horizon
almost
as
long
as
it
have
take
Mr.
Casaubon
to
become
engaged
and
married
:
but
this
learn
gentleman
be
possess
of
a
fortune
;
he
have
assemble
his
voluminous
note
,
and
have
make
that
sort
of
reputation
which
precede
performance
,
 
often
the
large
part
of
a
man
's
fame
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
a
wife
,
as
we
have
see
,
to
adorn
the
remain
quadrant
of
his
course
,
and
be
a
little
moon
that
would
cause
hardly
a
calculable
perturbation
.
 
<EOS>
but
Lydgate
be
young
,
poor
,
ambitious
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
his
half
-
century
before
him
instead
of
behind
him
,
and
he
have
come
to
Middlemarch
bent
on
do
many
thing
that
be
not
directly
fit
to
make
his
fortune
or
even
secure
him
a
good
income
.
 
<EOS>
to
a
man
under
such
circumstance
,
take
a
wife
be
something
more
than
a
question
of
adornment
,
however
highly
he
may
rate
this
;
and
Lydgate
be
dispose
to
give
it
the
first
place
among
wifely
function
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
taste

guide
by
a
single

here
be
the
point

which
Miss

would
be
find
want

notwithstanding
her
undeniable
beauty

She
do
not
look
at

the
society
of

be
about
as
relaxing
as

nothing

those

municipal

gradually
make
fresh

gradually
,
as
the

give

and
the

who

gather

come
from

some
with
an
alarming

other
with

<EOS>
in

,
much
the

sort
of
movement

mixture
go
on
in
old
England
as
we
find
in

Herodotus

who
also

in

think
it
well
to
take
a

though

apparently
beguile
by
attractive

be
the
reverse
of
Miss
Brooke
,
and
in
this
respect
perhaps
bear
more
resemblance
to
Rosamond
Vincy
,
who
have
excellent
taste
in
costume
,
with
that
nymph

like
figure
and
pure
blindness
which
give
the
large
range
to
choice
in
the
flow
and
color
of
drapery
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
thing
make
only
part
of
her
charm
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
admit
to
be
the
flower
of
Mrs.
Lemon
's
school
,
the
chief
school
in
the
county
,
where
the
teaching
include
all
that
be
demand
in
the
accomplished
female
 
even
to
extra
,
such
as
the
get
in

out

<EOS>
Mrs.
Lemon
herself
have
always
hold
up
Miss
Vincy
as
an
example
:
no
pupil
,
she
say
,
exceed
that
young
lady
for
mental
acquisition
and
propriety
of
speech
,
while
her
musical
execution
be
quite
exceptional
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
help
the
way
in
which
people
speak
of
us
,
and
probably
if
Mrs.
Lemon
have
undertake
to
describe
Juliet
or
Imogen
,
these
heroine
would
not
have
seem
poetical
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
vision
of
Rosamond
would
have
be
enough
with
most
judge
to
dispel
any
prejudice
excite
by
Mrs.
Lemon
's
praise
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
could
not
be
long
in
Middlemarch
without
have
that
agreeable
vision
,
or
even
without
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
Vincy
family
;
for
though
Mr.
Peacock
,
whose
practice
he
have
pay
something
to
enter
on
,
have
not
be
their
doctor
(
Mrs.
Vincy
not
like
the
lower
system
adopt
by
him
)
,
he
have
many
patient
among
their
connection
and
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
for
who
of
any
consequence
in
Middlemarch
be
not
connect
or
at
least
acquaint
with
the
Vincys
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
old
manufacturer
,
and
have
keep
a
good
house
for
three
generation
,
in
which
there
have
naturally
be
much
intermarry
with
neighbor
more
or
less
decidedly
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
's
sister
have
make
a
wealthy
match
in
accept
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
,
however
,
as
a
man
not
bear
in
the
town
,
and
altogether
of
dimly
know
origin
,
be
consider
to
have
do
well
in
unite
himself
with
a
real
Middlemarch
family
;
on
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Vincy
have
descend
a
little
,
have
take
an
innkeeper
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
this
side
too
there
be
a
cheering
sense
of
money
;
for
Mrs.
Vincy
's
sister
have
be
second
wife
to
rich
old
Mr.
Featherstone
,
and
have
die
childless
year
ago
,
so
that
her
nephew
and
niece
may
be
suppose
to
touch
the
affection
of
the
widower
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
happen
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
and
Mr.
Featherstone
,
two
of
Peacock
's
most
important
patient
,
have
,
from
different
cause
,
give
an
especially
good
reception
to
his
successor
,
who
have
raise
some
partisanship
as
well
as
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrench
,
medical
attendant
to
the
Vincy
family
,
very
early
have
ground
for
think
lightly
of
Lydgate
's
professional
discretion
,
and
there
be
no
report
about
him
which
be
not
retail
at
the
Vincys
'
,
where
visitor
be
frequent
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
be
more
inclined
to
general
good
-
fellowship
than
to
take
side
,
but
there
be
no
need
for
him
to
be
hasty
in
make
any
new
man
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
silently
wish
that
her
father
would
invite
Mr.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
tired
of
the
face
and
figure
she
have
always
be
use
to
 
the
various
irregular
profile
and
gait
and
turn
of
phrase
distinguish
those
Middlemarch
young
man
whom
she
have
know
as
boy

<EOS>
She
have
be
at
school
with
girl
of

<EOS>
whose

she
feel
sure

it
would
have
be
possible
for

to
be
more
interested

than
in
these
inevitable
Middlemarch
companion

<EOS>
but
she
would
not
have
choose
to
mention
her
wish
to
her
father
;
and
he
,
for
his
part
,
be
in
no

on
the
subject

<EOS>
an
alderman
about

at

there

that

often
remain

It

who
find
any

(

less

this
be
the

one
morning
of

in

we

Rosamond

for

continue
to
sit
at

longer
than

now
and
then
give
herself
a
little
shake

and
lay
her
work
on
her
knee
to
contemplate
it
with
an
air
of
hesitating
weariness

<EOS>
Her

return

sit
on
the

an

more
entire
placidity

until

she
look

this

forty

<EOS>
the
ride
to
Stone
Court
,
which
Fred
and
Rosamond
take
the
next
morning
,
lie
through
a
pretty
bit
of
midland
landscape
,
almost
all
meadow
and
pasture
,
with
hedgerows
still
allow
to
grow
in
bushy
beauty
and
to
spread
out
coral
fruit
for
the
bird
.
 
<EOS>
little
detail
give
each
field
a
particular
physiognomy
,
dear
to
the
eye
that
have
look
on
them
from
childhood
:
<EOS>
the
pool
in
the
corner
where
the
grass
be
dank
and
tree
lean
whisperingly
;
the
great
oak
shadow
a
bare
place
in
mid
-
pasture
;
the
high
bank
where
the
ash
-
tree
grow
;
the
sudden
slope
of
the
old
marl
-
pit
make
a
red
background
for
the
burdock
;
the
huddle
roof
and
rick
of
the
homestead
without
a
traceable
way
of
approach
;
the
gray
gate
and
fence
against
the
depth
of
the
border
wood
;
and
the
stray
hovel
,
its
old
,
old
thatch
full
of
mossy
hill
and
valley
with
wondrous
modulation
of
light
and
shadow
such
as
we
travel
far
to
see
in
later
life
,
and
see
large
,
but
not
more
beautiful
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
thing
that
make
the
gamut
of
joy
in
landscape
to
midland
-
breed
soul
 
the
thing
they
toddle
among
,
or
perhaps
learn
by
heart
stand
between
their
father
's
knee
while
he
drive
leisurely
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
road
,
even
the
byroad
,
be
excellent
;
for
Lowick
,
as
we
have
see
,
be
not
a
parish
of
muddy
lane
and
poor
tenant
;
and
it
be
into
Lowick
parish
that
Fred
and
Rosamond
enter
after
a
couple
of
mile
'
riding
.
 
<EOS>
another
mile
would
bring
them
to
Stone
Court
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
,
the
house
be
already
visible
,
look
as
if
it
have
be
arrest
in
its
growth
toward
a
stone
mansion
by
an
unexpected
budding
of
farm
-
building
on
its
left
flank
,
which
have
hinder
it
from
become
anything
more
than
the
substantial
dwelling
of
a
gentleman
farmer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
less
agreeable
an
object
in
the
distance
for
the
cluster
of
pinnacle
corn
-
rick
which
balance
the
fine
row
of
walnut
on
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
presently
it
be
possible
to
discern
something
that
may
be
a
gig
on
the
circular
drive
before
the
front
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
"
I
hope
none
of
my

horrible
relation

They
be
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
Mrs.

gig
 
<EOS>
the
last
yellow
gig
leave
,
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
Mrs.
Waule
in
it
,
I
understand
how
yellow
can
have
be
wear
for
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
that
gig
seem
to
me
more
funereal
than
a
hearse
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
Mrs.
Waule
always
have
black
crape
on
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
she
manage
it
,
Rosy
?
 
<EOS>

not
always
be

I
do
not

all

and
she
be
not
in
the
least
evangelical
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
reflectively
,
as
if
that
religious
point
of
view
would
have
fully
account
for
perpetual
crape
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
not
poor

she
add
,
after
a
moment
's
pause

no

the
Mrs.

so
far

distant

have
happen
to
say
this
very
morning
(
not
at
all

a
defiant
air

in

low

muffled

neutral

settle

he
give
her
a
momentary
sharp
glance

seem

too

<EOS>
You
bring
me
a
writing
from
Bulstrode
to
say
he
do
not
believe
you
have
ever
promise
to
pay
your

come
now

<EOS>
Mr.
Featherstone
's
face
require
its
whole
scale
of
grimace
as
a
muscular
outlet
to
his
silent
triumph
in
the
soundness
of
his
faculty
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
feel
himself
to
be
in
a
disgusting
dilemma
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
joke
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
like
other
man
,
believe
score
of
thing
that
be
not
true
,
and
he
have
a
prejudice
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
get
him
to
write
that
he
know
no
fact
in
proof
of
the
report
you
speak
of
,
though
it
may
lead
to
unpleasantness
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
hardly
ask
him
to
write
down
what
he
believe
or
do
not
believe
about
me
.
"
<EOS>
Fred
pause
an
instant
,
and
then
add
,
in
politic
appeal
to
his
uncle
's
vanity
,
"
that
be
hardly
a
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
disappoint
in
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
I
know
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
sooner
offend
me
than
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
he
be
get
no
land
hereabout
<EOS>
that
ever
I
hear
tell
of
.
 
<EOS>
a
speckilate
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
He
may
come
down
any
day
,
when
the
devil
leave
off
back
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
what
his
religion
mean
<EOS>
:
he
want
God
a'mighty
to
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
thing
I
make
out
pretty
clear
when
I
use
to
go
to
church
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
this
:
<EOS>
God
a'mighty
stick
to
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
land
,
and
He
give
land
,
and
He
make
chap
rich
with
corn
and
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
take
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
You
like
Bulstrode
and
speckilation
better
than
Featherstone
and
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
say
Fred
,
rise
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
beat
his
boot
with
his
whip
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
neither
Bulstrode
nor
speculation
.
"
<EOS>
He
speak
rather
sulkily
,
feel
himself
stalemate
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
you
can
do
without
me
,
that
be
pretty
clear
,
"
say
old
Featherstone
,
secretly
dislike
the
possibility
that
Fred
would
show
himself
at
all
independent
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
neither
want
a
bit
of
land
to
make
a
squire
of
you
instead
of
a
starve
parson
,
nor
a
lift
of
a
hundred
pound
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
five
codicil
if
I
like
,
and
I
shall
keep
my
bank

It

all
one

<EOS>
Fred
color
again
.
 
<EOS>
Featherstone
have
rarely
give
him
present
of
money
,
and
at
this
moment
it
seem
almost
hard
to
part
with
the
immediate
prospect
of
bank
-
note
than
with
the
more
distant
prospect
of
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
ungrateful
,
sir

<EOS>
I
never

You

Fred

in

Rosamond

be
talk
faster
than
their
male
friend

<EOS>
They
do
not

of

down

stand
at
the
toilet

table
near
the
window
while
Rosamond
take
off
her
hat
,
adjust
her
veil
,
and
apply
little
touch
of
her
finger
-
tip
to
her
hair
 
hair

infantine
fairness

neither
flaxen

<EOS>
Mary
Garth

all
the

at
an
angle
between
the
two
nymph
 
<EOS>
the
one
in

and
the
one
out
of
it

who
look
at
each
other
with
eye
of
heavenly
blue
,
deep
enough
to
hold
the
most
exquisite
meaning
an
ingenious
beholder
could
put
into
them
,
and
deep
enough
to
hide
the
meaning
of
the
owner
if
these
should
happen
to
be
less
exquisite
.
<EOS>
only
a
few
child
in
Middlemarch
look
blond
by
the

of
Rosamond

the

in

that
Miss

the
good

her
an
angel

<EOS>
Mary
Garth
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
the
aspect
of
an
ordinary
sinner
:
she
be
brown
;
her
curly
dark
hair
be
rough
and
stubborn
;
her
stature
be
low
;
and
it
would
not

in
satisfactory
antithesis

that
she
have
all
the
virtue

<EOS>
Plainness
have
its
peculiar
temptation
and
vice
quite
as
much
as
beauty

it
be
apt
either
to
feign
amiability
,
or
,
not
feign
it
,
to
show
all
the
repulsiveness
of
discontent
:
at
any
rate
,
to
be
call
an
ugly
thing
in
contrast
with
that
lovely
creature
your
companion

be
apt
to
produce
some
effect
beyond
a
sense
of
fine
veracity

fitness
in
the

<EOS>
at
the
age
of

twenty
Mary

certainly
not

perfect

a
streak
of
satiric
bitterness
continually
renew
and
never
carry
utterly
out
of
sight

except
by
a
strong
current
of
gratitude
towards
those
who
,
instead
of
tell
her
that
she
ought
to
be
content
,
do
something
to
make
her
so

<EOS>
advance
womanhood
have
temper
her
plainness

which
be
of
a

<EOS>
for
honesty
,
truth

Mary

reign
virtue

she
neither
try
to
create
illusion

nor
indulge
in
them
for

,
and
when

<EOS>
when

Mr.

be
rather
late
this
morning

but
the
visitor
stay
long
enough
to
see
him
;
for
Mr.
Featherstone
ask
Rosamond
to
sing
to
him
,
and
she
herself
be
so
kind
as
to
propose
a
second
favorite
song
of
his
 
"
flow
on
,
thou
shine

"
 
after
she
have
sing
"

which
she
detest

<EOS>
this

Overreach
approve
of
the
sentimental
song

as
the
suitable

also
as

the
right

for

<EOS>
Mr.

be
still
applaud
the

assure
missy
that
her

clear

His

whom
old
Featherstone
make
haste
ostentatiously
to
introduce
as
his
niece
,
though
he
have
never
think
it
worth

to
speak
of
Mary
Garth
in
that
light

<EOS>
nothing
escape
Lydgate
in
Rosamond
's
graceful
behavior
:
how
delicately
she
waive
the
notice
which
the
old
man
's
want
of
taste
have
thrust
upon
her
by
a
quiet
gravity
,
not

her
dimple
on

wrong
occasion

show
them
afterwards
in
speak

to

she
address
herself
with
so
much
good

interest

that
Lydgate

after
quickly
examine
Mary
more
fully

have
do
before
,
see
an
adorable
kindness

Rosamond

eye

but
Mary
from
some
cause
look
rather
out

"

"
middlemarch

not

say
Rosamond
,
with
a
pretty
lightness
,
go
towards
her
whip
,
which
lie
at
a
distance

<EOS>
lydgate
be
quick
in
anticipate
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
reach
the
whip
before
she
do
,
and
turn
to
present
it
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
bow
and
look
at
him
<EOS>
:
he
of
course
be
look
at
her
,
and
their
eye
meet
with
that
peculiar
meeting
which
be
never
arrive
at
by
effort
,
but
seem
like
a
sudden
divine
clearance
of
haze
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Lydgate
turn
a
little
paler
than
usual
,
but
Rosamond
blush
deeply
and
feel
a
certain
astonishment
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
she
be
really
anxious
to
go
,
and
do
not
know
what
sort
of
stupidity
her
uncle
be
talk
of
when
she
go
to
shake
hand
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
yet
this
result
,
which
she
take
to
be
a
mutual
impression
,
call
fall
in
love
,
be
just
what
Rosamond
have
contemplate
beforehand
.
<EOS>
ever
since
that
important
new
arrival
in
Middlemarch
she
have
weave
a
little
future
,
of
which
something
like
this
scene
be
the
necessary
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
stranger
,
whether
wreck
and
cling
to
a
raft
,
or
duly
escort
and
accompany
by
portmanteaus
,
have
always
have
a
circumstantial
fascination
for
the
virgin
mind
,
against
which
native
merit
have
urge
itself
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
stranger
be
absolutely
necessary
to
Rosamond
's
social
romance
,
which
have
always
turn
on
a
lover
and
bridegroom
who
be
not
a
Middlemarcher
,
and
who
have
no
connection
at
all
like
her
own
:
of
late
,
indeed
,
the
construction
seem
to
demand
that
he
should
somehow
be
relate
to
a
baronet
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
she
and
the
stranger
have
meet
,
reality
prove
much
more
moving
than
anticipation
,
and
Rosamond
could
not
doubt
that
this
be
the
great
epoch
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
judge
of
her
own
symptom
as
those
of
awaken
love
,
and
she
hold
it
still
more
natural
that
Mr.
Lydgate
should
have
fall
in
love
at
first
sight
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
happen
so
often
at
ball
,
and
why
not
by
the
morning
light
,
when
the
complexion
show
all
the
well
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
though
no
old
than
Mary
,
be
rather
use
to
be
fall
in
love
with
;
but
she
,
for
her
part
,
have
remain
indifferent
and
fastidiously
critical
towards
both
fresh
sprig
and
fade
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
Mr.
Lydgate
suddenly
correspond
to
her
ideal
,
be
altogether
foreign
to
Middlemarch
,
carry
a
certain
air
of
distinction
congruous
with
good
family
,
and
possess
connection
which
offer
vista
of
that
middle
-
class
heaven
,
rank
;
a
man
of
talent
,
also
,
whom
it
would
be
especially
delightful
to
enslave
:
in
fact
,
a
man
who
have
touch
her
nature
quite
newly
,
and
bring
a
vivid
interest
into
her
life
which
be
well
than
any
fancied
"
may
-
be
"
such
as
she
be
in
the
habit
of
oppose
to
the
actual
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
in
ride
home
,
both
the
brother
and
the
sister
be
preoccupy
and
inclined
to
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
whose
basis
for
her
structure
have
the
usual
airy
slightness
,
be
of
remarkably
detailed
and
realistic
imagination
when
the
foundation
have
be
once
presuppose
;
and
before
they
have
ride
a
mile
she
be
far
on
in
the
costume
and
introduction
of
her
wed
life
,
have
determine
on
her
house
in
Middlemarch
,
and
foresee
the
visit
she
would
pay
to
her
husband
's
high
-
breed
relative
at
a
distance
,
whose
finish
manner
she
could
appropriate
as
thoroughly
as
she
have
do
her
school
accomplishment
,
prepare
herself
thus
for
vaguer
elevation
which
may
ultimately
come
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
financial
,
still
less
sordid
,
in
her
prevision
:
she
care
about
what
be
consider
refinement
,
and
not
about
the
money
that
be
to
pay
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
's
mind
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
busy
with
an
anxiety
which
even
his
ready
hopefulness
could
not
immediately
quell
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
no
way
of
elude
Featherstone
's
stupid
demand
without
incur
consequence
which
he
like
less
even
than
the
task
of
fulfil
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
be
already
out
of
humor
with
him
,
and
would
be
still
more
so
if
he
be
the
occasion
of
any
additional
coolness
between
his
own
family
and
the
bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
himself
hate
have
to
go
and
speak
to
his
uncle
Bulstrode
,
and
perhaps
after
drink
wine
he
have
say
many
foolish
thing
about
Featherstone
's
property
,
and
these
have
be
magnify
by
report
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
feel
that
he
make
a
wretched
figure
as
a
fellow
who
brag
about
expectation
from
a
queer
old
miser
like
Featherstone
,
and
go
to
beg
for
certificate
at
his
bidding
.
<EOS>
but
 
those
expectation
!
 
<EOS>
He
really
have
them
,
and
he
see
no
agreeable
alternative
if
he
give
them
up
;
besides
,
he
have
lately
make
a
debt
which
gall
him
extremely
,
and
old
Featherstone
have
almost
bargain
to
pay
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
affair
be
miserably
small
:
his
debt
be
small
,
even
his
expectation
be
not
anything
so
very
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Fred
have
know
man
to
whom
he
would
have
be
ashamed
of
confess
the
smallness
of
his
scrape
.
 
<EOS>
such
rumination
naturally
produce
a
streak
of
misanthropic
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
bear
the
son
of
a
Middlemarch
manufacturer
,
and
inevitable
heir
to
nothing
in
particular
,
while
such
man
as
Mainwaring
and
Vyan
 
certainly
life
be
a
poor
business
,
when
a
spirited
young
fellow
,
with
a
good
appetite
for
the
good
of
everything
,
have
so
poor
an
outlook
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
not
occur
to
Fred
that
the
introduction
of
Bulstrode
's
name
in
the
matter
be
a
fiction
of
old
Featherstone
's
;
nor
could
this
have
make
any
difference
to
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
plainly
enough
that
the
old
man
want
to
exercise
his
power
by
torment
him
a
little
,
and
also
probably
to
get
some
satisfaction
out
of
see
him
on
unpleasant
term
with
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
fancy
that
he
see
to
the
bottom
of
his
uncle
Featherstone
's
soul
,
though
in
reality
half
what
he
see
there
be
no
more
than
the
reflex
of
his
own
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
the
difficult
task
of
know
another
soul
be
not
for
young
gentleman
whose
consciousness
be
chiefly
make
up
of
their
own
wish
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
's
main
point
of
debate
with
himself
be
,
whether
he
should
tell
his
father
,
or
try
to
get
through
the
affair
without
his
father
's
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probably
Mrs.
Waule
who
have
be
talk
about
him
;
and
if
Mary
Garth
have
repeat
Mrs.
Waule
's
report
to
Rosamond
,
it
would
be
sure
to
reach
his
father
,
who
would
as
surely
question
him
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
to
Rosamond
,
as
they
slacken
their
pace
    
"
Rosy
,
do
Mary
tell
you
that
Mrs.
Waule
have
say
anything

"
  
<EOS>

yes

<EOS>
in
consequence
of
what
he
have
hear
from
Fred

Mr.
Vincy
determine
to
speak
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
in
his
private
room
at
the
Bank
at
half
-
past
one

when
he
be
usually
free
from

a
visitor
have
come
in
at
one
o'clock

and
Mr.

have
so
much
to
say
to
him
,
that
there
be
little
chance
of
the
interview
be
over
in
half
an
hour

<EOS>
the

's
speech
be
fluent
,
but
it
be
also
copious
,
and
he
use
up
an
appreciable
amount
of
time
in
brief
meditative
pause
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
imagine
his
sickly
aspect
to
have
be
of
the
yellow
,
black
-
haired
sort
:
he
have
a
pale
blond
skin
,
thin
gray

light

,
and
a

<EOS>
loud
man
call
his
subdued
tone
an
undertone
,
and
sometimes
imply
that
it
be
inconsistent
with
openness
;
though
there
seem
to
be
no
reason
why
a
loud
man
should
not
be
give
to
concealment
of
anything
except
his
own
voice
,
unless
it
can
be
show
that
Holy
Writ
have
place
the
seat
of
candor
in
the
lung
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
also
a
deferential
bend
attitude
in
listening
,
and
an
apparently
fix
attentiveness
in
his
eye
which
make
those
person
who
think
themselves
worth
hear
infer
that
he
be
seek
the
utmost
improvement
from
their
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
Others
,
who
expect
to
make
no
great
figure
,
dislike
this
kind
of
moral
lantern
turn
on
them
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
not

there
be

such

<EOS>
hence
Mr.

's
close
attention
be
not

it
be
attribute

Less

five

twenty

nobody
have
ever

of

Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
present
visitor
,
Lydgate
,
the
scrutinizing
look
be
a
matter
of
indifference
:
he
simply
form
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
the
banker
's
constitution
,
and
conclude
that
he
have
an
eager
inward
life
with
little
enjoyment

"
I
shall
be

<EOS>
"
a
fine

may
be
the
nucleus
of

medical
school
here

once
we

medical
reform

and
what
would
do
more

a

one
of

habitually
deep

sonorous

capable
of
become
very
low

gentle
at
the
right
moment

<EOS>
about
his
ordinary

there
be
a

much
fortify

contempt

this
proud
openness

make
lovable
by

<EOS>
Mr.

perhaps
like
him

he
certainly

"
I
shall
rejoice

not

<EOS>
I
acknowledge
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
in
fighting

I
should
not

I

My

labor

with

as
to
all
the
high

which
determine

any
glimmering

can
only
come

notion

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
bend
and
look
intently
,
find
the
form
which
Lydgate
have
give
to
his
agreement
not
quite
suited
to
his
comprehension
.
 
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
a
judicious
man
change
the
topic
and
enter
on
ground
where
his
own
gift
may
be
more
useful
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
aware
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
the
peculiar
bias
of
medical
ability
be
towards
material
mean
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
I
hope
we
shall
not
vary
in
sentiment
as
to
a
measure
in
which
you
be
not
likely
to
be
actively
concern
,
but
in
which
your
sympathetic
concurrence
may
be
an
aid
to
me

<EOS>
You
recognize
,
I
hope
;
the
existence
of
spiritual
interest
in
your
patient

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
do

those

apt

precisely
.

and
on

wrong
teaching

fatal

<EOS>
now
a
point
which
I
have
much
at
heart
to
secure
be
a
new
regulation
as

clerical
attendance

"
Mr.

,
my

be
a
man
deeply
painful

I

Lydgate

bluntly

<EOS>
"
what
I
desire
,
"
Mr.
Bulstrode
continue
,
look
still
more
serious
,
"
be
that
Mr.
Farebrother
's
attendance
at
the
hospital
should
be
supersede
by
the
appointment
of
a
chaplain
 
of
Mr.
Tyke
,
in
fact
 
and
that
no
other
spiritual
aid
should
be
call
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
a
medial
man
I
could
have
no
opinion
on
such
a
point

I

then
I
should
require
to
know

case

be
apply

Lydgate

he
be
bent
on
be
circumspect

<EOS>
"
of
course
you
can
not
enter
fully
into
the
merit
of
this
measure
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
but
"
 
here
Mr.
Bulstrode
begin
to
speak
with
a
more
chisel
emphasis
 
<EOS>
"
the
subject
be
likely
to
be
refer
to
the
medical
board
of
the
infirmary
,
and
what
I
trust
I
may
ask
of
you
be
,
that
in
virtue
of
the
cooperation
between
us
which
I
now
look
forward
to

you
will

<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
clerical
dispute

Lydgate

<EOS>
"
the
path
I
have
choose
be
to
work
well
in

own
profession

My
responsibility
,
Mr.

be
of
a
broad
kind

<EOS>
with
me
,
indeed
,
this
question
be
one
of
sacred
accountableness
;
whereas
with
my
opponent
,
I
have
good
reason
to
say
that
it
be
an
occasion
for
gratify
a
spirit
of
worldly
opposition

but
I
shall
not
therefore
drop
one
iota
of
my
conviction

cease
to
identify
myself
with
that
truth
which
an
evil
generation
hate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
devote
myself
to
this
object
of
hospital
-
improvement
,
but
I
will
boldly
confess
to
you
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
that
I
should
have
no
interest
in
hospital
if
I
believe
that
nothing
more
be
concern
therein
than
the
cure
of
mortal
disease

I
have
another
ground
of
action

in
the
face
of
persecution
I
will
not
conceal
it

<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
voice
have
become
a
loud
and
agitated
whisper
as
he

the
last
word

"
there
we
certainly
differ

he
be
not
sorry
that
the
door
be
now
open

and
Mr.
Vincy
be
announce

<EOS>
that
florid
sociable
personage
be
become
more
interesting
to
him
since
he
have

not
that
,
like
her

he
have

weave
any

naturally
remember

give

when

have
the
immediate

mayor

be
ready
,
in
the
interest

to
take
up
a
firm
attitude

he
have
naturally
a

he
feel
his

the

will
insist
on

him
on

vague
a

lax
money

lending

of

out

bluntly

Mr.

by
Mr.

for
early
the
next
morning
a
letter
come

Fred

the

put

He

make

I
distinctly
affirm

You
wish

I
should

curtly

keep
on

withdraw

under

It
be

come
in

He
speak
in

<EOS>
Mary
's
eye
look
rather
red
,
as
if
she
have
be
cry
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
Mr.
Featherstone
be
in
one
of
his
most
snappish
humor
this
morning
,
and
though
Fred
have
now
the
prospect
of
receive
the
much
-
need
present
of
money
,
he
would
have
prefer
be
free
to
turn
round
on
the
old
tyrant
and
tell
him
that
Mary
Garth
be
too
good
to
be
at
his
beck
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Fred
have
rise
as
she
enter
the
room
,
she
have
barely
notice
him
,
and
look
as
if
her
nerve
be
quiver
with
the
expectation
that
something
would
be
throw
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
have
anything
bad
than
word
to
dread
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
go
to
reach
the
waistcoat
from
a
peg
,
Fred
go
up
to
her
and
say
,
"
allow
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
it
alone
!
 
<EOS>
You
bring
it
,
missy
,
and
lie
it
down
here
,
"
say
Mr.
Featherstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
you
go
away
again
till
I
call
you
,
"
he
add
,
when
the
waistcoat
be
lay
down
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
usual
with
him
to
season
his
pleasure
in
show
favor
to
one
person
by
be
especially
disagreeable
to
another
,
and
Mary
be
always
at
hand
to
furnish
the
condiment
.
 
<EOS>
when
his
own
relative
come
she
be
treat
better
.
 
<EOS>
slowly
he
take
out
a
bunch
of
key
from
the
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
slowly
he
draw
forth
a
tin
box
which
be
under
the
bed
-
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
expect
I
be
go
to
give
you
a
little
fortune
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
look
above
his
spectacle
and
pause
in
the
act
of
open
the
lid
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
good
enough
to
speak
of
make
me
a
present
the
other
day
,
else
,
of
course
,
I
should
not
have
think
of
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Fred
be
of
a
hopeful
disposition
,
and
a
vision
have
present
itself
of
a
sum
just
large
enough
to
deliver
him
from
a
certain
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
when
Fred
get
into
debt
,
it
always
seem
to
him
highly
probable
that
something
or
other
 
he
do
not
necessarily
conceive
what
 
would
come
to
pass
enable
him
to
pay
in
due
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
that
the
providential
occurrence
be
apparently
close
at
hand
,
it
would
have
be
sheer
absurdity
to
think
that
the
supply
would
be
short
of
the
need
:
as
absurd
as
a
faith
that
believe
in
half
a
miracle
for
want
of
strength
to
believe
in
a
whole
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
deep
-
veined
hand
finger
many
bank
-
note
-
one
after
the
other
,
lay
them
down
flat
again
,
while
Fred
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
scorn
to
look
eager
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
himself
to
be
a
gentleman
at
heart
,
and
do
not
like
court
an
old
fellow
for
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
Mr.
Featherstone
eye
him
again
over
his
spectacle
and
present
him
with
a
little
sheaf
of
note
:
<EOS>
Fred
could
see
distinctly
that
there
be
but
five
,
as
the
less
significant
edge
gape
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
each
may
mean
fifty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
them
,
say
    
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
sir
,
"
and
be
go
to
roll
them
up
without
seem
to
think
of
their
value
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
suit
Mr.
Featherstone
,
who
be
eye
him
intently
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
do
not
you
think
it
worth
your
while
to
count
'em
?
 
<EOS>
You
take
money
like
a
lord
;
I
suppose
you
lose
it
like
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
be
not
to
look
a
gift
-
horse
in
the
mouth
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
count
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
be
not
so
happy
,
however
,
after
he
have
count
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
they
actually
present
the
absurdity
of
be
less
than
his
hopefulness
have
decide
that
they
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
the
fitness
of
thing
mean
,
if
not
their
fitness
to
a
man
's
expectation
?
 
<EOS>
fail
this
,
absurdity
and
atheism
gape
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
collapse
for
Fred
be
severe
when
he
find
that
he
hold
no
more
than
five
twenty
,
and
his
share
in
the
high
education
of
this
country
do
not
seem
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
say
,
with
rapid
change
in
his
fair
complexion
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
handsome
of
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Featherstone
,
lock
his
box
and
replace
it
,
then
take
off
his
spectacle
deliberately
,
and
at
length
,
as
if
his
inward
meditation
have
more
deeply
convinced
him
,
repeat
,
"
I
should
think
it
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
I
be
very
grateful
,
"
say
Fred
,
who
have
have
time
to
recover
his
cheerful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
to
cut
a
figure
in
the
world
,
and
I
reckon
Peter
Featherstone
be
the
only
one
you
have
get
to
trust
to
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
the
old
man
's
eye
gleam
with
a
curiously
mingle
satisfaction
in
the
consciousness
that
this
smart
young
fellow
rely
upon
him
,
and
that
the
smart
young
fellow
be
rather
a
fool
for
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
:
I
be
not
bear
to
very
splendid
chance
.
 
<EOS>
few
man
have
be
more
cramp
than
I
have
be
,
"
say
Fred
,
with
some
sense
of
surprise
at
his
own
virtue
,
consider
how
hardly
he
be
deal
with
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
really
seem
a
little
too
bad
to
have
to
ride
a
break
-
winded
hunter
,
and
see
man
,
who
,
be
not
half
such
good
judge
as
yourself

able
to
throw
away
any
amount
of
money
on
buy
bad
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
can
buy
yourself
a
fine
hunter
now
.
 
<EOS>
eighty
pound
be
enough
for
that
,
I
reckon
 
and
you
will
have
twenty
pound
over
to
get
yourself
out
of
any
little
scrape
,
"
say
Mr.
Featherstone
,
chuckle
slightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
,
sir
,
"
say
Fred
,
with
a
fine
sense
of
contrast
between
the
word
and
his
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
rather
a
well
uncle
than
your
fine
uncle
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
get
much
out
of
his
spekilation
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
get
a
pretty
strong
string
round
your
father
's
leg

by
what
I
hear
,
eh

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
never
tell
me
anything
about
his
affair

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
show
some
sense
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
other
people
find
'em
out
without
his
telling
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
will

never
have
much
to
leave
you

he
will
most

like
die
without

<EOS>
he
be
the
sort

do
it

let
'em
make
him
mayor
of
Middlemarch
as
much

you
will
not
get
much
by
his
dying
without
a
will
,
though
you

be

the
eld
son

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
think
that
Mr.
Featherstone
have
never
be
so
disagreeable
before
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
he
have
never
before
give
him
quite
so
much
money
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
destroy
this
letter
of
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
say
Fred
,
rise
with
the
letter
as
if
he
would
put
it
in
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
I
do
not

it

<EOS>
It
be
worth
no
money

me

"
  
<EOS>
Fred
carry
the
letter
to
the
fire
,
and
thrust
the
poker
through
it
with
much
z
.
 
<EOS>
He
long
to
get
out
of
the
room
,
but
he
be
a
little
ashamed
before
his
inner
self
,
as
well
as
before
his
uncle
,
to
run
away
immediately
after
pocket
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
the
farm

bailiff
come
up
to
give
his
master
a
report
,
and
Fred
,
to
his
unspeakable
relief
,
be
dismiss
with
the
injunction
to
come
again
soon
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
long
not
only
to
be
set
free
from
his
uncle
,
but
also
to
find
Mary
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
now
in
her
usual
place
by
the
fire
,
with
sewing
in
her
hand

a
book
open
on
the
little
table
by
her
side

<EOS>
Her
eyelid
have
lose
some
of
their
redness
now

she
have
her
usual
air
of
self

command

I

up

she

half
rise

"
no

Mary
sit
down
again
,
and
resume
her
work

<EOS>
She
be
certainly
treat
him
with
more
indifference
than
usual

she
do
not

how
affectionately
indignant
he
have
feel
on

up

you

heavy

I
be
not
aware

and
to
me
it
be
one
of
the
most
odious
thing
in
a
girl
's
life
,
that
there
must
always
be
some
supposition
of
fall
in
love
come
between

any
man

be
kind
to
her

to
whom
she
be
grateful

I
should
have
think
that
I

at

may
have
be
safe
from
all
that

I
have
no
ground
for

nonsensical
vanity

fancy

love

me

Mary
do
not
mean
to
betray
any

in

herself
she
end
in

tremulous
tone

vexation

country
doctor
,
and
in
Middlemarch
at
that
time
<EOS>
such
an
impression
be
significant
of
great
thing
be
expect
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
for
everybody
's
family
doctor
be
remarkably
clever
,
and
be
understand
to
have
immeasurable
skill
in
the
management
and
training
of
the
most
skittish
or
vicious
disease
.
 
<EOS>
the
evidence
of
his
cleverness
be
of
the
high
intuitive
order
,
lie
in
his
lady
-
patient
'
immovable
conviction
,
and
be
unassailable
by
any
objection
except
that
their
intuition
be
oppose
by
other
equally
strong
;
each
lady
who
see
medical
truth
in
Wrench
and
"
the
strengthen
treatment
"
regard
Toller
and
"
the
lower
system
"
as
medical
perdition
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
heroic
time
of
copious
bleeding
and
blistering
have
not
yet
depart
,
still
less
the
time
of
thorough
-
go
theory
,
when
disease
in
general
be
call
by
some
bad
name
,
and
treat
accordingly
without
shilly
-
shally
 
as
if
,
for
example
,
it
be
to
be
call
insurrection
,
which
must
not
be
fire
on
with
blank
-
cartridge
,
but
have
its
blood
draw
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
strengthener
and
the
lowerer
be
all
"
clever
"
man
in
somebody
's
opinion
,
which
be
really
as
much
as
can
be
say
for
any
live
talent
.
<EOS>
nobody
's
imagination
have
go
so
far
as
to
conjecture
that
Mr.
Lydgate
could
know
as
much
as
Dr.
Sprague
and
Dr.
Minchin
,
the
two
physician
,
who
alone
could
offer
any
hope
when
danger
be
extreme
,
and
when
the
small
hope
be
worth
a
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
I
repeat
,
there
be
a
general
impression
that
Lydgate
be
something
rather
more
uncommon
than
any
general
practitioner
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
but
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
an
age
at
which
many
man
be
not
quite
common
 
at
which
they
be
hopeful
of
achievement
,
resolute
in
avoidance
,
think
that
Mammon
shall
never
put
a
bit
in
their
mouth
and
get
astride
their
back
,
but
rather
that
Mammon
,
if
they
have
anything
to
do
with
him
,
shall
draw
their
chariot
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
leave
an
orphan
when
he
be
fresh
from
a
public
school
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
,
a
military
man
,
have
make
but
little
provision
for
three
child
,
and
when
the
boy
Tertius
ask
to
have
a
medical
education
,
it
seem
easy
to
his
guardian
to
grant
his
request
by
apprentice
him
to
a
country
practitioner
than
to
make
any
objection
on
the
score
of
family
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
rarer
lad
who
early
get
a
decide
bent
and
make
up
their
mind
that
there
be
something
particular
in
life
which
they
would
like
to
do
for
its
own
sake
,
and
not
because
their
father
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
us
who
turn
to
any
subject
with
love
remember
some
morning
or
evening
hour
when
we
get
on
a
high
stool
to
reach
down
an
untried
volume
,
or
sit
with
parted
lip
listen
to
a
new
talker
,
or
for
very
lack
of
book
begin
to
listen
to
the
voice
within
,
as
the
first
traceable
beginning
of
our
love
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
that
sort
happen
to
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
quick
fellow
,
and
when
hot
from
play
,
would
toss
himself
in
a
corner
,
and
in
five
minute
be
deep
in
any
sort
of
book
that
he
could
lay
his
hand
on
:
if
it
be
Rasselas
or
Gulliver
,
so
much
the
well
,
but
Bailey
's
Dictionary
would
do
,
or
the
Bible
with
the
Apocrypha
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Something
he
must
read
,
when
he
be
not
ride
the
pony
,
or
running
and
hunt
,
or
listen
to
the
talk
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
true
of
him
at
ten
year
of
age
;
he
have
then
read
through
"
Chrysal
,
or
the
Adventures
of
a
Guinea
,
"
which
be
neither
milk
for
babe
,
nor
any
chalky
mixture
mean
to
pass
for
milk
,
and
it
have
already
occur
to
him
that
book
be
stuff
,
and
that
life
be
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
His
school
study
have
not
much
modify
that
opinion
,
for
though
he
"
do
"
his
classic
and
mathematic
,
he
be
not
pre
-
eminent
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
of
him
,
that
Lydgate
could
do
anything
he
like
,
but
he
have
certainly
not
yet
like
to
do
anything
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
vigorous
animal
with
a
ready
understanding
,
but
no
spark
have
yet
kindle
in
him
an
intellectual
passion
;
knowledge
seem
to
him
a
very
superficial
affair
,
easily
master
:
<EOS>
judge
from
the
conversation
of
his
elder
,
he
have
apparently
get
already
more
than
be
necessary
for
mature
life
.
 
<EOS>
probably
this
be
not
an
exceptional
result
of
expensive
teaching
at
that
period
of
short
-
waiste
coat
,
and
other
fashion
which
have
not
yet
recur
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
one
vacation
,
a
wet
day
send
him
to
the
small
home
library
to
hunt
once
more
for
a
book
which
may
have
some
freshness
for
him
:
in
vain
!
<EOS>
unless
,
indeed
,
he
take
down
a
dusty
row
of
volume
with
gray
-
paper
back
and
dingy
label
 
the
volume
of
an
old
Cyclopaedia
which
he
have
never
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
at
least
be
a
novelty
to
disturb
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
on
the
high
shelf
,
and
he
stand
on
a
chair
to
get
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
open
the
volume
which
he
first
take
from
the
shelf
:
somehow
,
one
be
apt
to
read
in
a
makeshift
attitude
,
just
where
it
may
seem
inconvenient
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
page
he
open
on
be
under
the
head
of
Anatomy
,
and
the
first
passage
that
draw
his
eye
be
on
the
valve
of
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
much
acquaint
with
valve
of
any
sort
,
but
he
know
that
valvae
be
fold
-
door
,
and
through
this
crevice
come
a
sudden
light
startle
him
with
his
first
vivid
notion
of
finely
adjust
mechanism
in
the
human
frame
.
 
<EOS>
a
liberal
education
have
of
course
leave
him
free
to
read
the
indecent
passage
in
the
school
classic
,
but
beyond
a
general
sense
of
secrecy
and
obscenity
in
connection
with
his
internal
structure
,
have
leave
his
imagination
quite
unbiassed
,
so
that
for
anything
he
know
his
brain
lay
in
small
bag
at
his
temple
,
and
he
have
no
more
thought
of
represent
to
himself
how
his
blood
circulate
than
how
paper
serve
instead
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
moment
of
vocation
have
come
,
and
before
he
get
down
from
his
chair
,
the
world
be
make
new
to
him
by
a
presentiment
of
endless
process
fill
the
vast
space
plank
out
of
his
sight
by
that
wordy
ignorance
which
he
have
suppose
to
be
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
hour
Lydgate
feel
the
growth
of
an
intellectual
passion
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
not
afraid
of
tell
over
and
over
again
how
a
man
come
to
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
and
be
wed
to
her
,
or
else
be
fatally
part
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
due
to
excess
of
poetry
or
of
stupidity
that
we
be
never
weary
of
describe
what
King
James
call
a
woman
's
"
makdom
and
her
fairnesse
,
"
never
weary
of
listen
to
the
twanging
of
the
old
Troubadour
string
,
and
be
comparatively
uninterested
in
that
other
kind
of
"
makdom
and
fairnesse
"
which
must
be
woo
with
industrious
thought
and
patient
renunciation
of
small
desire
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
story
of
this
passion
,
too
,
the
development
vary
:
sometimes
it
be
the
glorious
marriage
,
sometimes
frustration
and
final
parting
.
 
<EOS>
and
not
seldom
the
catastrophe
be
bind
up
with
the
other
passion
,
sing
by
the
Troubadours
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
the
multitude
of
middle
-
aged
man
who
go
about
their
vocation
in
a
daily
course
determine
for
them
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
tie
of
their
cravat
,
there
be
always
a
good
number
who
once
mean
to
shape
their
own
deed
and
alter
the
world
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
of
their
come
to
be
shapen
after
the
average
and
fit
to
be
pack
by
the
gross
,
be
hardly
ever
tell
even
in
their
consciousness
;
for
perhaps
their
ardor
in
generous
unpaid
toil
cool
as
imperceptibly
as
the
ardor
of
other
youthful
love
,
till
one
day
their
early
self
walk
like
a
ghost
in
its
old
home
and
make
the
new
furniture
ghastly
.
<EOS>
nothing
in
the
world
more
subtle
than
the
process
of
their
gradual
change
!
 
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
they
inhale
it
unknowingly
:
you
and
I
may
have
send
some
of
our
breath
towards
infect
them
,
when
we
utter
our
conforming
falsity
or
draw
our
silly
conclusion
:
or
perhaps
it
come
with
the
vibration
from
a
woman
's
glance
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
mean
to
be
one
of
those
failure
,
and
there
be
the
well
hope
of
him
because
his
scientific
interest
soon
take
the
form
of
a
professional
enthusiasm
:
he
have
a
youthful
belief
in
his
bread
-
win
work
,
not
to
be
stifle
by
that
initiation
in
makeshift
call
his
'
prentice
day
;
and
he
carry
to
his
study
in
London
,
Edinburgh
,
and
Paris
,
the
conviction
that
the
medical
profession
as
it
may
be
be
the
fine
in
the
world
;
present
the
most
perfect
interchange
between
science
and
art
;
offer
the
most
direct
alliance
between
intellectual
conquest
and
the
social
good
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
nature
demand
this
combination
:
he
be
an
emotional
creature
,
with
a
flesh
-
and
-
blood
sense
of
fellowship
which
withstand
all
the
abstraction
of
special
study
.
 
<EOS>
He
care
not
only
for
"
case
,
"
but
for
John
and
Elizabeth
,
especially
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
attraction
in
his
profession
:
it
want
reform
,
and
give
a
man
an
opportunity
for
some
indignant
resolve
to
reject
its
venal
decoration
and
other
humbug
,
and
to
be
the
possessor
of
genuine
though
undemanded
qualification
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
study
in
Paris
with
the
determination
that
when
he
come
home
again
he
would
settle
in
some
provincial
town
as
a
general
practitioner
,
and
resist
the
irrational
severance
between
medical
and
surgical
knowledge
in
the
interest
of
his
own
scientific
pursuit
,
as
well
as
of
the
general
advance
:
he
would
keep
away
from
the
range
of
London
intrigue
,
jealousy
,
and
social
truckling
,
and
win
celebrity
,
however
slowly
,
as
Jenner
have
do
,
by
the
independent
value
of
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
remember
that
this
be
a
dark
period
;
and
in
spite
of
venerable
college
which
use
great
effort
to
secure
purity
of
knowledge
by
make
it
scarce
,
and
to
exclude
error
by
a
rigid
exclusiveness
in
relation
to
fee
and
appointment
,
it
happen
that
very
ignorant
young
gentleman
be
promote
in
town
,
and
many
more
get
a
legal
right
to
practise
over
large
area
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
the
high
standard
hold
up
to
the
public
mind
by
the
College
of
Physicians
,
which
give
its
peculiar
sanction
to
the
expensive
and
highly
rarefy
medical
instruction
obtain
by
graduate
of
Oxford
and
Cambridge
,
do
not
hinder
quackery
from
have
an
excellent
time
of
it
;
for
since
professional
practice
chiefly
consist
in
give
a
great
many
drug
<EOS>
,
the
public
infer
that
it
may
be
well
off
with
more
drug
still
,
if
they
could
only
be
get
cheaply
,
and
hence
swallow
large
cubic
measure
of
physic
prescribe
by
unscrupulous
ignorance
which
have
take
no
degree
.
<EOS>
consider
that
statistic
have
not
yet
embrace
a
calculation
as
to
the
number
of
ignorant
or
cant
doctor
which
absolutely
must
exist
in
the
tooth
of
all
change
,
it
seem
to
Lydgate
that
a
change
in
the
unit
be
the
most
direct
mode
of
change
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
He
mean
to
be
a
unit
who
would
make
a
certain
amount
of
difference
towards
that
spread
change
which
would
one
day
tell
appreciably
upon
the
average
,
and
in
the
mean
time
have
the
pleasure
of
make
an
advantageous
difference
to
the
viscera
of
his
own
patient
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
simply
aim
at
a
more
genuine
kind
of
practice
than
be
common
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
ambitious
of
a
wide
effect
:
he
be
fire
with
the
possibility
that
he
may
work
out
the
proof
of
an
anatomical
conception
and
make
a
link
in
the
chain
of
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
do
it
seem
incongruous
to
you
that
a
Middlemarch
surgeon
should
dream
of
himself
as
a
discoverer
?
 
<EOS>
Most
of
us
,
indeed
,
know
little
of
the
great
originator
until
they
have
be
lift
up
among
the
constellation
and
already
rule
our
fate
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
Herschel
,
for
example
,
who
"
break
the
barrier
of
the
heavens
<EOS>
"
 
do
he
not
once
play
a
provincial
church
-
organ
,
and
give
music
-
lesson
to
stumble
pianist
?
 
<EOS>
each
of
those
Shining
Ones
have
to
walk
on
the
earth
among
neighbor
who
perhaps
think
much
more
of
his
gait
and
his
garment
than
of
anything
which
be
to
give
him
a
title
to
everlasting
fame
:
each
of
them
have
his
little
local
personal
history
sprinkle
with
small
temptation
and
sordid
care
,
which
make
the
retard
friction
of
his
course
towards
final
companionship
with
the
immortal
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
not
blind
to
the
danger
of
such
friction
,
but
he
have
plenty
of
confidence
in
his
resolution
to
avoid
it
as
far
as
possible
:
be
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
he
feel
himself
experience
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
not
go
to
have
his
vanity
provoke
by
contact
with
the
showy
worldly
success
of
the
capital
,
but
to
live
among
people
who
could
hold
no
rivalry
with
that
pursuit
of
a
great
idea
which
be
to
be
a
twin
object
with
the
assiduous
practice
of
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
fascination
in
the
hope
that
the
two
purpose
would
illuminate
each
other
:
the
careful
observation
and
inference
which
be
his
daily
work
,
the
use
of
the
lens
to
further
his
judgment
in
special
case
,
would
further
his
thought
as
an
instrument
of
large
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
the
typical
pre
-
eminence
of
his
profession
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
good
Middlemarch
doctor
,
and
by
that
very
mean
keep
himself
in
the
track
of
far
-
reach
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
point
he
may
fairly
claim
approval
at
this
particular
stage
of
his
career
:
he
do
not
mean
to
imitate
those
philanthropic
model
who
make
a
profit
out
of
poisonous
pickle
to
support
themselves
while
they
be
expose
adulteration
,
or
hold
share
in
a
gambling
-
hell
that
they
may
have
leisure
to
represent
the
cause
of
public
morality
.
 
<EOS>
He
intend
to
begin
in
his
own
case
some
particular
reform
which
be
quite
certainly
within
his
reach
,
and
much
less
of
a
problem
than
the
demonstrating
of
an
anatomical
conception
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
reform
be
to
act
stoutly
on
the
strength
of
a
recent
legal
decision
,
and
simply
prescribe
,
without
dispense
drug
or
take
percentage
from
druggist
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
innovation
for
one
who
have
choose
to
adopt
the
style
of
general
practitioner
in
a
country
town
,
and
would
be
feel
as
offensive
criticism
by
his
professional
brother
.
 
<EOS>
but
Lydgate
mean
to
innovate
in
his
treatment
also
,
and
he
be
wise
enough
to
see
that
the
good
security
for
his
practising
honestly
accord
to
his
belief
be
to
get
rid
of
systematic
temptation
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
that
be
a
more
cheerful
time
for
observer
and
theorizer
than
the
present
;
we
be
apt
to
think
it
the
fine
era
of
the
world
when
America
be
begin
to
be
discover
,
when
a
bold
sailor
,
even
if
he
be
wreck
,
may
alight
on
a
new
kingdom
;
and
about
1829
the
dark
territory
of
Pathology
be
a
fine
America
for
a
spirited
young
adventurer
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
ambitious
above
all
to
contribute
towards
enlarge
the
scientific
,
rational
basis
of
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
he
become
interested
in
special
question
of
disease
,
such
as
the
nature
of
fever
or
fever
,
the
more
keenly
he
feel
the
need
for
that
fundamental
knowledge
of
structure
which
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
have
be
illuminate
by
the
brief
and
glorious
career
of
Bichat
,
who
die
when
he
be
only
one
-
and
-
thirty
,
but
,
like
another
Alexander
,
leave
a
realm
large
enough
for
many
heir
.
 
<EOS>
that
great
Frenchman
first
carry
out
the
conception
that
live
body
,
fundamentally
consider
,
be
not
association
of
organ
which
can
be
understand
by
study
them
first
apart
,
and
then
as
it
be
federally
;
but
must
be
regard
as
consist
of
certain
primary
webs
or
tissue
,
out
of
which
the
various
organ
 
brain
,
heart
,
lung
,
and
so
on
 
be
compact
,
as
the
various
accommodation
of
a
house
be
build
up
in
various
proportion
of
wood
,
iron
,
stone
,
brick
,
zinc
,
and
the
rest
,
each
material
have
its
peculiar
composition
and
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
,
one
see
,
can
understand
and
estimate
the
entire
structure
or
its
part
 
what
be
its
frailty
and
what
its
repair
,
without
know
the
nature
of
the
material
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
conception
work
out
by
Bichat
,
with
his
detailed
study
of
the
different
tissue
,
act
necessarily
on
medical
question
as
the
turning
of
gas
-
light
would
act
on
a
dim
,
oil
-
light
street
,
show
new
connection
and
hitherto
hidden
fact
of
structure
which
must
be
take
into
account
in
consider
the
symptom
of
malady
and
the
action
of
medicament
.
 
<EOS>
but
result
which
depend
on
human
conscience
and
intelligence
work
slowly
,
and
now
at
the
end
of
1829
,
most
medical
practice
be
still
strut
or
shamble
along
the
old
path
,
and
there
be
still
scientific
work
to
be
do
which
may
have
seem
to
be
a
direct
sequence
of
Bichat
be
.
<EOS>
this
great
seer
do
not
go
beyond
the
consideration
of
the
tissue
as
ultimate
fact
in
the
live
organism
,
mark
the
limit
of
anatomical
analysis
;
but
it
be
open
to
another
mind
to
say
,
have
not
these
structure
some
common
basis
from
which
they
have
all
start
,
as
your
sarsnet
,
gauze
,
net
,
satin
,
and
velvet
from
the
raw
cocoon
?
 
<EOS>
here
would
be
another
light
,
as
of
oxy
-
hydrogen
,
show
the
very
grain
of
thing
,
and
revise
all
former
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
sequence
to
Bichat
's
work
,
already
vibrate
along
many
current
of
the
european
mind
,
Lydgate
be
enamour
;
he
long
to
demonstrate
the
more
intimate
relation
of
live
structure
,
and
help
to
define
man
's
think
more
accurately
after
the
true
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
work
have
not
yet
be
do
,
but
only
prepare
for
those
who
know
how
to
use
the
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
primitive
tissue
?
 
<EOS>
in
that
way
Lydgate
put
the
question
 
not
quite
in
the
way
require
by
the
await
answer
;
but
such
missing
of
the
right
word
befall
many
seeker
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
count
on
quiet
interval
to
be
watchfully
seize
,
for
take
up
the
thread
of
investigation
 
on
many
hint
to
be
win
from
diligent
application
,
not
only
of
the
scalpel
,
but
of
the
microscope
,
which
research
have
begin
to
use
again
with
new
enthusiasm
of
reliance
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
Lydgate
's
plan
of
his
future
:
to
do
good
small
work
for
Middlemarch
,
and
great
work
for
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
a
happy
fellow
at
this
time
:
to
be
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
without
any
fix
vice
,
with
a
generous
resolution
that
his
action
should
be
beneficent
,
and
with
idea
in
his
brain
that
make
life
interesting
quite
apart
from
the
cultus
of
horseflesh
and
other
mystic
rite
of
costly
observance
,
which
the
eight
hundred
pound
leave
him
after
buy
his
practice
would
certainly
not
have
go
far
in
pay
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
at
a
start
-
point
which
make
many
a
man
's
career
a
fine
subject
for
betting
,
if
there
be
any
gentleman
give
to
that
amusement
who
could
appreciate
the
complicated
probability
of
an
arduous
purpose
,
with
all
the
possible
thwarting
and
furthering
of
circumstance
,
all
the
nicety
of
inward
balance
,
by
which
a
man
swim
and
make
his
point
or
else
be
carry
headlong
.
 
<EOS>
the
risk
would
remain
even
with
close
knowledge
of
Lydgate
's
character
;
for
character
too
be
a
process
and
an
unfolding
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
still
in
the
making
,
as
much
as
the
Middlemarch
doctor
and
immortal
discoverer
,
and
there
be
both
virtue
and
fault
capable
of
shrink
or
expand
.
 
<EOS>
the
fault
will
not
,
I
hope
,
be
a
reason
for
the
withdrawal
of
your
interest
in
him
.
<EOS>
among
our
value
friend
be
there
not
some
one
or
other
who
be
a
little
too
self
-
confident
and
disdainful
;
whose
distinguished
mind
be
a
little
spot
with
commonness
;
who
be
a
little
pinched
here
and
protuberant
there
with
native
prejudice
;
or
whose
well
energy
be
liable
to
lapse
down
the
wrong
channel
under
the
influence
of
transient
solicitation
?
 
<EOS>
all
these
thing
may
be
allege
against
Lydgate
,
but
then
,
they
be
the
periphrasis
of
a
polite
preacher
,
who
talk
of
Adam
,
and
would
not
like
to
mention
anything
painful
to
the
pew
-
renter
.
 
<EOS>
the
particular
fault
from
which
these
delicate
generality
be
distil
have
distinguishable
physiognomy
,
diction
,
accent
,
and
grimace
;
fill
up
part
in
very
various
drama
.
 
<EOS>
Our
vanity
differ
as
our
nose
do
:
all
conceit
be
not
the
same
conceit
,
but
vary
in
correspondence
with
the
minutia
of
mental
make
in
which
one
of
us
differ
from
another
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
conceit
be
of
the
arrogant
sort
,
never
simper
,
never
impertinent
,
but
massive
in
its
claim
and
benevolently
contemptuous
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
do
a
great
deal
for
noodle
,
be
sorry
for
them
,
and
feel
quite
sure
that
they
could
have
no
power
over
him
:
he
have
think
of
join
the
Saint
Simonians
when
he
be
in
Paris
,
in
order
to
turn
them
against
some
of
their
own
doctrine
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
fault
be
mark
by
kindred
trait
,
and
be
those
of
a
man
who
have
a
fine
baritone
,
whose
clothe
hang
well
upon
him
,
and
who
even
in
his
ordinary
gesture
have
an
air
of
inbreed
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
where
then
lie
the
spot
of
commonness
?
<EOS>
say
a
young
lady
enamour
of
that
careless
grace
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
there
be
any
commonness
in
a
man
<EOS>
so
well
-
breed
,
so
ambitious
of
social
distinction
,
so
generous
and
unusual
in
his
view
of
social
duty
?
 
<EOS>
as
easily
as
there
may
be
stupidity
in
a
man
of
genius
if
you
take
him
unawares
on
the
wrong
subject
,
or
as
many
a
man
who
have
the
good
will
to
advance
the
social
millennium
may
be
ill
-
inspire
in
imagine
its
light
pleasure
;
unable
to
go
beyond
Offenbach
's
music
,
or
the
brilliant
punning
in
the
last
burlesque
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
spot
of
commonness
lie
in
the
complexion
of
his
prejudice
,
which
,
in
spite
of
noble
intention
and
sympathy
,
be
half
of
them
such
as
be
find
in
ordinary
man
of
the
world
:
<EOS>
that
distinction
of
mind
which
belong
to
his
intellectual
ardor
,
do
not
penetrate
his
feeling
and
judgment
about
furniture
,
or
woman
,
or
the
desirability
of
its
be
know
(
without
his
telling
)
that
he
be
better
bear
than
other
country
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
mean
to
think
of
furniture
at
present
;
but
whenever
he
do
so
it
be
to
be
fear
that
neither
biology
nor
scheme
of
reform
would
lift
him
above
the
vulgarity
of
feeling
that
there
would
be
an
incompatibility
in
his
furniture
not
be
of
the
good
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
woman
,
he
have
once
already
be
draw
headlong
by
impetuous
folly
,
which
he
mean
to
be
final
,
since
marriage
at
some
distant
period
would
of
course
not
be
impetuous
.
 
<EOS>
for
those
who
want
to
be
acquaint
with
Lydgate
it
will
be
good
to
know
what
be
that
case
of
impetuous
folly
,
for
it
may
stand
as
an
example
of
the
fitful
swerving
of
passion
to
which
he
be
prone
,
together
with
the
chivalrous
kindness
which
help
to
make
him
morally
lovable
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
can
be
tell
without
many
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
when
he
be
study
in
Paris
,
and
just
at
the
time
when
,
over
and
above
his
other
work
,
he
be
occupy
with
some
galvanic
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
,
tired
with
his
experimenting
,
and
not
be
able
to
elicit
the
fact
he
need
,
he
leave
his
frog
and
rabbit
to
some
repose
under
their
trying
and
mysterious
dispensation
of
unexplained
shock
,
and
go
to
finish
his
evening
at
the
theatre
of
the
Porte
Saint
Martin
,
where
there
be
a
melodrama
which
he
have
already
see
several
time
;
<EOS>
attract
,
not
by
the
ingenious
work
of
the
collaborate
author
,
but
by
an
actress
whose
part
it
be
to
stab
her
lover
,
mistake
him
for
the
evil
-
design
duke
of
the
piece
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
in
love
with
this
actress
,
as
a
man
be
in
love
with
a
woman
whom
he
never
expect
to
speak
to
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
Provencale
,
with
dark
eye
,
a
greek
profile
,
and
round
majestic
form
,
have
that
sort
of
beauty
which
carry
a
sweet
matronliness
even
in
youth
,
and
her
voice
be
a
soft
cooing
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
but
lately
come
to
Paris
,
and
bear
a
virtuous
reputation
,
<EOS>
her
husband
act
with
her
as
the
unfortunate
lover
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
her
acting
<EOS>
which
be
"
no
well
than
it
should
be
,
"
but
the
public
be
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
only
relaxation
now
be
to
go
and
look
at
this
woman
,
just
as
he
may
have
throw
himself
under
the
breath
of
the
sweet
south
on
a
bank
of
violet
for
a
while
,
without
prejudice
to
his
galvanism
,
to
which
he
would
presently
return
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
evening
the
old
drama
have
a
new
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
moment
when
the
heroine
be
to
act
the
stabbing
of
her
lover
,
and
he
be
to
fall
gracefully
,
the
wife
veritably
stab
her
husband
,
who
fall
as
death
will
.
 
<EOS>
a
wild
shriek
pierce
the
house
,
and
the
Provencale
fall
swoon
:
<EOS>
a
shriek
and
a
swoon
be
demand
by
the
play
,
but
the
swooning
too
be
real
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
leap
and
climb
,
he
hardly
know
<EOS>
how
,
on
to
the
stage
,
and
be
active
in
help
,
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
heroine
by
find
a
contusion
on
her
head
and
lift
her
gently
in
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Paris
ring
with
the
story
of
this
death
:
 
be
it
a
murder
?
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
actress
's
warm
admirer
be
incline
to
believe
in
her
guilt
,
and
like
her
the
well
for
it
(
such
be
the
taste
of
those
time
)
;
but
Lydgate
be
not
one
of
these
.
 
<EOS>
He
vehemently
contend
for
her
innocence
,
and
the
remote
impersonal
passion
for
her
beauty
which
he
have
feel
before
,
have
pass
now
into
personal
devotion
,
and
tender
thought
of
her
lot
.
 
<EOS>
the
notion
of
murder
be
absurd
:
no
motive
be
discoverable
,
the
young
couple
be
understand
to
dote
on
each
other
;
and
it
be
not
unprecedented
that
an
accidental
slip
of
the
foot
should
have
bring
these
grave
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
the
legal
investigation
end
in
Madame
Laure
's
release
.
 
<EOS>
lydgate
by
this
time
have
have
many
interview
with
her
,
and
find
her
more
and
more
adorable
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
little
;
but
that
be
an
additional
charm
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
melancholy
,
and
seem
grateful
;
her
presence
be
enough
,
like
that
of
the
evening
light
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
madly
anxious
about
her
affection
,
and
jealous
lest
any
other
man
than
himself
should
win
it
and
ask
her
to
marry
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
instead
of
reopen
her
engagement
at
the
Porte
Saint
Martin
,
where
she
would
have
be
all
the
more
popular
for
the
fatal
episode
,
she
leave
Paris
without
warn
,
forsake
her
little
court
of
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
no
one
carry
inquiry
far
except
Lydgate
,
who
feel
that
all
science
have
come
to
a
stand
-
still
while
he
imagine
the
unhappy
Laure
,
stricken
by
ever
-
wander
sorrow
,
herself
wander
,
and
find
no
faithful
comforter
.
 
<EOS>
hide
actress
,
however
,
be
not
so
difficult
to
find
as
some
other
hide
fact
,
and
it
be
not
long
before
Lydgate
gather
indication
that
Laure
have
take
the
route
to
Lyons
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
her
at
last
act
with
great
success
at
Avignon
under
the
same
name
,
look
more
majestic
than
ever
as
a
forsaken
wife
carry
her
child
in
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
to
her
after
the
play
,
be
receive
with
the
usual
quietude
which
seem
to
him
beautiful
as
clear
depth
of
water
,
and
obtain
leave
to
visit
her
the
next
day
;
when
he
be
bent
on
tell
her
that
he
adore
her
,
and
on

He

to

Laure

full

galvanism
again
in

chamber

end

He

but
he
have
more
reason

that

henceforth
he

<EOS>
no

a

SIR
CHARLES
SEDLEY
.
  
<EOS>
the
question
whether
Mr.
Tyke
should
be
appoint
as
salaried
chaplain
to
the
hospital
be
an
exciting
topic
to
the
Middlemarchers
;
and
Lydgate
hear
it
discuss
in
a
way
that
throw
much
light
on
the
power
exercise
in
the
town
by
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
the
banker
be
evidently
a
ruler
,
but
there
be
an
opposition
party
,
and
even
among
his
supporter
there
be
some
who
allow
it
to
be
see
that
their
support
be
a
compromise
,
and
who
frankly
state
their
impression
that
the
general
scheme
of
thing
,
and
especially
the
casualty
of
trade
,
require
you
to
hold
a
candle
to
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
power
be
not
due
simply
to
his
be
a
country
banker
,
who
know
the
financial
secret
of
most
trader
in
the
town
and
could
touch
the
spring
of
their
credit
;
it
be
fortify
by
a
beneficence
that
be
at
once
ready
and
severe
 
ready
to
confer
obligation
,
and
severe
in
watch
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
gather
,
as
an
industrious
man
always
at
his
post
,
a
chief
share
in
administer
the
town
charity
,
and
his
private
charity
be
both
minute
and
abundant
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
take
a
great
deal
of
pain
about
apprentice
Tegg
the
shoemaker
's
son
,
and
he
would
watch
over
Tegg
's
church
-
go
;
he
would
defend
Mrs.
Strype
the
washerwoman
against
Stubbs
's
unjust
exaction
on
the
score
of
her
drying
-
ground
,
and
he
would
himself
scrutinize
a
calumny
against
Mrs.
Strype
.
 
<EOS>
His
private
minor
loan
be
numerous
,
but
he
would
inquire
strictly
into
the
circumstance
both
before
and
after
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
a
man
gather
a
domain
in
his
neighbor
'
hope
and
fear
as
well
as
gratitude
;
and
power
,
when
once
it
have
get
into
that
subtle
region
,
propagate
itself
,
spread
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
external
mean
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
principle
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
gain
as
much
power
as
possible
,
that
he
may
use
it
for
the
glory
of
God
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
through
a
great
deal
of
spiritual
conflict
and
inward
argument
in
order
to
adjust
his
motive
,
and
make
clear
to
himself
what
God
's
glory
require
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
we
have
see
,
his
motive
be
not
always
rightly
appreciate
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
crass
mind
in
Middlemarch
<EOS>
whose
reflective
scale
could
only
weigh
thing
in
the
lump
;
and
they
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
since
Mr.
Bulstrode
could
not
enjoy
life
in
their
fashion
,
eating
and
drink
so
little
as
he
do
,
and
worrete
himself
about
everything
,
he
must
have
a
sort
of
vampire
's
feast
in
the
sense
of
mastery
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
of
the
chaplaincy
come
up
at
Mr.
Vincy
's
table
when
Lydgate
be
dine
there
,
and
the
family
connection
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
do
not
,
he
observe
,
prevent
some
freedom
of
remark
even
on
the
part
of
the
host
himself
,
though
his
reason
against
the
propose
arrangement
turn
entirely
on
his
objection
to
Mr.
Tyke
's
sermon
,
which
be
all
doctrine
,
and
his
preference
for
Mr.
Farebrother
,
whose
sermon
be
free
from
that
taint
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
like
well
enough
the
notion
of
the
chaplain
be
have
a
salary
,
suppose
it
be
give
to
Farebrother
,
who
be
as
good
a
little
fellow
as
ever
breathe
,
and
the
good
preacher
anywhere
,
and
companionable
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
line
shall
you
take
,
then
?
"
say
Mr.
chichely
,
the
coroner
,
a
great
course
comrade
of
Mr.
Vincy
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
precious
glad
<EOS>
I
be
not
one
of
the
director
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
vote
for
refer
the
matter
to
the
director
and
the
Medical
Board
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
roll
some
of
my
responsibility
on
your
shoulder
,
Doctor
,
"
say
Mr.
Vincy
,
glance
first
at
Dr.
Sprague
,
the
senior
physician
of
the
town
,
and
then
at
Lydgate
who
sit
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
medical
gentleman
must
consult
which
sort
of
black
draught
you
will
prescribe
,
eh
,
Mr.
Lydgate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
little
of
either
,
"
say
lydgate
;
"
but
in
general
,
appointment
be
apt
to
be
make
too
much
a
question
of
personal
liking
.
 
<EOS>
the
fit
man
for
a
particular
post
be
not
always
the
good
fellow
or
the
most
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
if
you
want
to
get
a
reform
,
your
only
way
would
be
to
pension
off
the
good
fellow
whom
everybody
be
fond
of
,
and
put
them
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Sprague
,
who
be
consider
the
physician
of
most
"
weight
,
"
though
Dr.
Minchin
be
usually
say
to
have
more
"
penetration
,
"
divest
his
large
heavy
face
of
all
expression
,
and
look
at
his
wine
-
glass
while
Lydgate
be
speak
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
be
not
problematical
and
suspect
about
this
young
man
 
<EOS>
for
example
,
a
certain
showiness
as
to
foreign
idea
,
and
a
disposition
to
unsettle
what
have
be
settle
and
forget
by
his
elder
 
be
positively
unwelcome
to
a
physician
whose
standing
have
be
fix
thirty
year
before
by
a
treatise
on
Meningitis
,
of
which
at
least
one
copy
mark
"
own
"
be
bind
in
calf
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
I
have
some
fellow
-
feeling
with
Dr.
Sprague
:
one
's
self
-
satisfaction
be
an
untaxed
kind
of
property
which
it
be
very
unpleasant
to
find
deprecate
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
remark
,
however
,
do
not
meet
the
sense
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
say
,
that
if
he
could
have
_
<EOS>
his
_
way
,
he
would
not
put
disagreeable
fellow
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
hang
your
reform
!
"
say
Mr.
Chichely
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
great
humbug
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
hear
of
a
reform
,
but
it
mean
some
trick
to
put
in
new
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
not
one
of
the
"
Lancet
's
"
man
,
Mr.
Lydgate
 
want
to
take
the
coronership
out
of
the
hand
of
the
legal
profession
:
your
word
appear
to
point
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
disapprove
of
Wakley
,
"
interpose
Dr.
Sprague
,
"
no
man
more
:
he
be
an
ill
-
intentione
fellow
,
who
would
sacrifice
the
respectability
of
the
profession
,
which
everybody
know
depend
on
the
London
Colleges
,
for
the
sake
of
get
some
notoriety
for
himself

<EOS>
there
be
man
who
do
not
mind
about
be
kick
blue
if
they
can
only
get
talk
about
.
<EOS>
but
Wakley
be
right
sometimes
,
"
the
Doctor
add
,
judicially
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
mention
one
or
two
point
in
which
Wakley
be
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
,
"
say
Mr.
chichely
,
"
I
blame
no
man
for
stand
up
in
favor
of
his
own
cloth
;
but
,
come
to
argument
,
I
should
like
to
know
how
a
coroner
be
to
judge
of
evidence
if
he
have
not
have
a
legal
training
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
my
opinion
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
"
legal
training
only
make
a
man
more
incompetent
in
question
that
require
knowledge
a
of
another
kind
.
<EOS>
People
talk
about
evidence
as
if
it
could
really
be
weigh
in
scale
by
a
blind
Justice
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
can
judge
what
be
good
evidence
on
any
particular
subject
,
unless
he
know
that
subject
well

<EOS>
a
lawyer
be
no
well
than
an
old
woman
at
a
post
-
mortem
examination
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
know
the
action
of
a
poison
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
say
that
scanning
verse
will
teach
you
to
scan
the
potato
crop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
aware
,
I
suppose
,
that
it
be
not
the
coroner
's
business
to
conduct
the
post
-
mortem
,
but
only
to
take
the
evidence
of
the
medical
witness
?
"
say
Mr.
chichely
,
with
some
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
often
almost
as
ignorant
as
the
coroner
himself

Lydgate

"

question
of
medical
jurisprudence
ought
not
to

leave
to
the
chance
of
decent
knowledge
in

the

ought
not

will
believe

destroy

so

Lydgate
have
really
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
Mr.
Chichely
be
his
Majesty

and
end
innocently
with
the
question

do
not

shall
we
join

"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
private
opinion
be
that
Mr.
chichely
may
be
the
very
coroner
without
bias
as
to
the
coat
of
the
stomach
,
but
he
have
not
mean
to
be
personal
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
difficulty
of
move
in
good
Middlemarch
society
:
it
be
dangerous
to
insist
on
knowledge
as
a
qualification
for
any
salaried
office
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
Vincy
have
call
Lydgate
a
prig
,
and
now
Mr.
chichely
be
incline
to
call
him
prick
-
eare
;
especially
when
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
he
seem
to
be
make
himself
eminently
agreeable
to
Rosamond
,
whom
he
have
easily
monopolize
in
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
,
since
Mrs.
Vincy
herself
sit
at
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
She
resign
no
domestic
function
to
her
daughter
;
and
the
matron
's
bloom
good
-
natured
face
,
with
the
two
volatile
pink
string
float
from
her
fine
throat
,
and
her
cheery
manner
to
husband
and
child
,
be
certainly
among
the
great
attraction
of
the
Vincy
house
 
attraction
which
make
it
all
the
easy
to
fall
in
love
with
the
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
tinge
of
unpretentious
,
inoffensive
vulgarity
in
Mrs.
Vincy
give
more
effect
to
Rosamond
's
refinement
,
which
be
beyond
what
Lydgate
have
expect
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
,
small
foot
and
perfectly
turn
shoulder
aid
the
impression
of
refined
manner
,
and
the
right
thing
say
seem
quite
astonishingly
right
when
it
be
accompany
with
exquisite
curve
of
lip
and
eyelid
.
<EOS>
and
Rosamond
could
say
the
right
thing
;
for
she
be
clever
with
that
sort
of
cleverness
which
catch
every
tone
except
the
humorous
.
<EOS>
happily
she
never
attempt
to
joke
,
and
this
perhaps
be
the
most
decisive
mark
of
her
cleverness
.
  
<EOS>
She
and
Lydgate
readily
get
into
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
regret
that
he
have
not
hear
her
sing
the
other
day
at
Stone
Court
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
pleasure
he
allow
himself
during
the
latter
part
of
his
stay
in
Paris
be
to
go
and
hear
music
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
study
music
,
probably
?
"
say
Rosamond
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
know
the
note
of
many
bird
,
and
I
know
many
melody
by
ear
;
but
the
music
that
I
do
not
know
at
all
,
and
have
no
notion
about
,
delight
me
 
affect
me
.
 
<EOS>
how
stupid
the
world
be
that
it
do
not
make
more
use
of
such
a
pleasure
within
its
reach
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
you
will
find
Middlemarch
very
tuneless
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
any
good
musician
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
two
gentleman
who
sing
at
all
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
the
fashion
to
sing
comic
song
in
a
rhythmic
way
,
leave
you
to
fancy
the
tune
 
very
much
as
if
it
be
tap
on
a
drum
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
have
hear
Mr.
Bowyer
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
one
of
her
rare
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
we
be
speak
very
ill
of
our
neighbor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
almost
forget
that
he
must
carry
on
the
conversation
,
in
think
how
lovely
this
creature
be
,
her
garment
seem
to
be
make
out
of
the
faint
blue
sky
,
herself
so
immaculately
blond
,
as
if
the
petal
of
some
gigantic
flower
have
just
open
and
disclose
her
;
and
yet
with
this
infantine
blondness
show
so
much
ready
,
self
-
possess
grace
.
 
<EOS>
since
he
have
have
the
memory
of
Laure
,
Lydgate
have
lose
all
taste
for
large
-
eyed
silence
:
the
divine
cow
no
longer
attract
him
,
and
Rosamond
be
her
very
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
recall
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
hear
some
music
to

night

I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
let
you
hear
my
attempt

Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
"
Papa
be
sure
to
insist
on
my

I
shall
tremble
before

the
good
singer
in
Paris

<EOS>
I
have
hear
very
little

:
I
have
only
once
be
to
London

<EOS>
but
our
organist
at
St.

be
a
good
musician
,
and
I
go
on
study
with
him
.

<EOS>
"
tell
me
what
you
see
in
London
.
"
  
"
very
little
.

<EOS>
(
a
more
naive
girl
would
have
say
,
"
oh
,
everything
!

Rosamond
know
better

<EOS>
"
a

of

<EOS>
"
do
you
call
yourself
a

Lydgate
,
look
at
her
with
an
involuntary
emphasis
of
admiration
,
which
make
Rosamond
blush
with
pleasure

<EOS>
but
she
remain
simply
serious
,
turn
her
long
neck
a
little
,
and
put
up
her
hand
to
touch
her
wondrous
hair

plait
 
an
habitual
gesture
with
her
as
pretty
as
any
movement
of
a
kitten
's
paw

<EOS>
not
that
Rosamond

she

Her
master
at
Mrs.

school
(
close
to
a
county
town
with
a
memorable
history
that
have
its
relic
in
church

castle
)
be
one
of
those
excellent
musician
here
and
there
to
be
find
in
our
province
,
worthy
to
compare
with
many
a
note
Kapellmeister
in
a
country
which
offer
more
plentiful
condition
of
musical
celebrity
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
with
the
executant
's
instinct
,
have
seize
his
manner
of
playing
,
and
give
forth
his
large
rendering
of
noble
music
with
the
precision
of
an
echo
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
startling
,
hear
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
hidden
soul
seem
to
be
flow
forth
from
Rosamond
's
finger
;
and
so
indeed
it
be
,
since
soul
live
on
in
perpetual
echo
,
and
to
all
fine
expression
there
go
somewhere
an
originating
activity
,
if
it
be
only
that
of
an
interpreter
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
take
possession
of
,
and
begin
to
believe
in
her
as
something
exceptional
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
think
,
one
nee
not
be
surprised
to
find
the
rare
conjunction
of
nature
under
circumstance
apparently
unfavorable
:
come
where
they
may
,
they
always
depend
on
condition
that
be
not
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
look
at
her
,
and
do
not
rise
to
pay
her
any
compliment
,
leave
that
to
other
,
now
that
his
admiration
be
deepen
.
  
<EOS>
Her
singing
be
less
remarkable
,
but
also
well
train
,
and
sweet
to
hear
as
a
chime
perfectly
in
tune
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
<EOS>
she
sing
"
meet
me
by
moonlight
,
"
and
"
I
have
be
roam
"
;
for
mortal
must
share
the
fashion
of
their
time
,
and
none
but
the
ancient
can
be
always
classical
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
could
also
sing
"
Black
-
eyed
Susan
"
with
effect
,
or
Haydn
's
canzonet
,
or
"
Voi
,
che
sapete

"
Batti
,
batti
"
 
<EOS>
she
only
want
to
know
what
her
audience
like
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
look
round
at
the
company
,
delight
in
their
admiration
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
sit
,
like
a
Niobe
before
her
trouble
,
with
her
young
little
girl
on
her
lap
,
softly
beat
the
child
's
hand
up
and
down
in
time
to
the
music

<EOS>
and
Fred
,
notwithstanding
his
general
scepticism
about
Rosy
,
listen
to
her
music
with
perfect
allegiance
,
wish
he
could
do
the
same
thing
on
his
flute
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
pleasantest
family
party
that
Lydgate
have
see
since
he
come
to
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
the
Vincys
have
the
readiness
to
enjoy
,
the
rejection
of
all
anxiety
,
and
the
belief
in
life
as
a
merry
lot
,
which
make
a
house
exceptional
in
most
county
town
at
that
time
,
when
Evangelicalism
have
cast
a
certain
suspicion
as
of
plague
-
infection
over
the
few
amusement
which
survive
in
the
province
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
Vincys
'
there
be
always
whist
,
and
the
card
-
table
stand
ready
now
,
make
some
of
the
company
secretly
impatient
of
the
music
.
 
<EOS>
before
it
cease
Mr.
Farebrother
come
in
 
a
handsome
,
broad
-
cheste
but
otherwise
small
man
,
about
forty
,
whose
black
be
very
threadbare
:
the
brilliancy
be
all
in
his
quick
gray
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
like
a
pleasant
change
in
the
light
,
arrest
little
Louisa
with
fatherly
nonsense
as
she
be
be
lead
out
of
the
room
by
Miss
Morgan
,
greet
everybody
with
some
special
word
,
and
seem
to
condense
more
talk
into
ten
minute
than
have
be
hold
all
through
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
He
claim
from
Lydgate
the
fulfilment
of
a
promise
to
come
and
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
let
you
off
,
you
know
,
because
I
have
some
beetle
to
show
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
collector
feel
an
interest
in
every
new
man
till
he
have
see
all
we
have
to
show
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
soon
he
swerve
to
the
whist
-
table
,
rub
his
hand
and
say
,
"
come
now
,
let
us
be
serious
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lydgate
?
<EOS>
not
play
?
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
be
too
young
and
light
for
this
kind
of
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
say
to
himself
that
the
clergyman
whose
ability
be
so
painful
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
appear
to
have
find
an
agreeable
resort
in
this
certainly
not
erudite
household
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
half
understand
it
:
<EOS>
the
good
-
humor
,
the
good
look
of
elder
and
young
,
and
the
provision
for
pass
the
time
without
any
labor
of
intelligence
,
may
make
the
house
beguile
to
people
who
have
no
particular
use
for
their
odd
hour
.
  
<EOS>
everything
look
blooming
and
joyous
except
Miss
Morgan
,
who
be
brown
,
dull
,
and
resign
,
and
altogether
,
as
Mrs.
Vincy
often
say
,
just
the
sort
of
person
for
a
governess
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
mean
to
pay
many
such
visit
himself
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
a
wretched
waste
of
the
evening
;
and
now
,
when
he
have
talk
a
little
more
to
Rosamond
,
he
mean
to
excuse
himself
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
like
us
at
Middlemarch
<EOS>
,
I
feel
sure
,
"
she
say
,
when
the
whist
-
player
be
settle
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
very
stupid
,
and
you
have
be
use
to
something
quite
different
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
all
country
town
be
pretty
much
alike
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
notice
that
one
always
believe
one
's
own
town
to
be
more
stupid
than
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
take
Middlemarch
as
it
come
,
and
shall
be
much
oblige
if
the
town
will
take
me
in
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
find
some
charm
in
it
which
be
much
great
than
I
have
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
ride
towards
Tipton
and
Lowick
;
every
one
be
pleased
with
those
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
simplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
mean
something
much
near
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
rise
and
reach
her
netting
,
and
then
say
,
"
do
you
care
about
dance
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
sure
whether
clever
man
ever
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
dance
with
you
if
you
would
allow
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
a
slight
deprecatory
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
go
to
say
that
we
sometimes
have
dance
,
and
I
want
to
know
whether
you
would
feel
insulted
if
you
be
ask
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
on
the
condition
I
mention
.
<EOS>
"
  
after
this
chat
Lydgate
think
that
he
be
go
,
but
on
move
towards
the
whist
-
table
,
he
get
interested
in
watch
Mr.
Farebrother
's
play
,
which
be
masterly
,
and
also
his
face
,
which
be
a
striking
mixture
of
the
shrewd
and
the
mild
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
supper
be
bring
in
(
such
be
the
custom
of
Middlemarch
)
and
there
be
punch
-
drinking
;
but
Mr.
Farebrother
have
only
a
glass
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
win
,
but
there
seem
to
be
no
reason
why
the
renewal
of
rubber
should
end
,
and
Lydgate
at
last
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
not
eleven
o'clock
,
he
choose
to
walk
in
the
brisk
air
towards
the
tower
of
St.
Botolph
's
,
Mr.
Farebrother
's
church
,
which
stand
out
dark
,
square
,
and
massive
against
the
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
old
church
in
Middlemarch
;
the
living
,
however
,
be
but
a
vicarage
worth
barely
four
hundred
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
hear
that
,
and
he
wonder
now
whether
Mr.
Farebrother
care
about
the
money
he
win
at
card
;
think
,
"
He
seem
a
very
pleasant
fellow
,
but
Bulstrode
may
have
his
good
reason
.
"
 
<EOS>
many
thing
would
be
easy
to
lydgate
if
it
should
turn
out
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
generally
justifiable
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
his
religious
doctrine
to
me
,
if
he
carry
some
good
notion
along
with
it
?
 
<EOS>
one
must
use
such
brain
as
be
to
be
find
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
be
actually
Lydgate
's
first
meditation
as
he
walk
away
from
Mr.
Vincy
's
,
and
on
this
ground
I
fear
that
many
lady
will
consider
him
hardly
worthy
of
their
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
Rosamond
and
her
music
only
in
the
second
place
;
and
though
,
when
her
turn
come
,
he
dwell
on
the
image
of
her
for
the
rest
of
his
walk
,
he
feel
no
agitation
,
and
have
no
sense
that
any
new
current
have
set
into
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
marry
yet
;
he
wish
not
to
marry
for
several
year
;
and
therefore
he
be
not
ready
to
entertain
the
notion
of
be
in
love
with
a
girl
whom
he
happen
to
admire
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
admire
Rosamond
exceedingly
;
but
that
madness
which
have
once
beset
him
about
Laure
be
not
,
he
think
,
likely
to
recur
in
relation
to
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
if
fall
in
love
have
be
at
all
in
question
,
it
would
have
be
quite
safe
with
a
creature
like
this
Miss
Vincy
,
who
have
just
the
kind
of
intelligence
one
would
desire
in
a
woman
 
polished
,
refined
,
docile
,
lend
itself
to
finish
in
all
the
delicacy
of
life
,
and
enshrine
in
a
body
which
express
this
with
a
force
of
demonstration
that
exclude
the
need
for
other
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
feel
sure
that
if
ever
he
marry
,
his
wife
would
have
that
feminine
radiance
,
that
distinctive
womanhood
which
must
be
class
with
flower
and
music
,
that
sort
of
beauty
which
by
its
very
nature
be
virtuous
,
be
mould
only
for
pure
and
delicate
joy
.
  
<EOS>
but
since
he
do
not
mean
to
marry
for
the
next
five
year
 
his
more
pressing
business
be
to
look
into
Louis
'
new
book
on
Fever
,
which
he
be
specially
interested
in
,
because
he
have
know
Louis
in
Paris
,
and
have
follow
many
anatomical
demonstration
in
order
to
ascertain
the
specific
difference
of
typhus
and
typhoid
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
home
and
read
far
into
the
small
hour
,
bring
a
much
more
testing
vision
of
detail
and
relation
into
this
pathological
study
than
he
have
ever
think
it
necessary
to
apply
to
the
complexity
of
love
and
marriage
,
these
be
subject
on
which
he
feel
himself
amply
inform
by
literature
,
and
that
traditional
wisdom
which
be
hand
down
in
the
genial
conversation
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
Fever
have
obscure
condition
,
and
give
him
that
delightful
labor
of
the
imagination
which
be
not
mere
arbitrariness
,
but
the
exercise
of
discipline
power
 
combine
and
construct
with
the
clear
eye
for
probability
and
the
full
obedience
to
knowledge
;
and
then
,
in
yet
more
energetic
alliance
with
impartial
Nature
,
stand
aloof
to
invent
test
by
which
to
try
its
own
work
.
  
<EOS>
many
man
have
be
praise
as
vividly
imaginative
on
the
strength
of
their
profuseness
in
indifferent
drawing
or
cheap
narration
:
 
report
of
very
poor
talk
go
on
in
distant
orb
;
or
portrait
of
Lucifer
come
down
on
his
bad
errand
as
a
large
ugly
man
with
bat
's
wing
and
spurt
of
phosphorescence
;
or
exaggeration
of
wantonness
that
seem
to
reflect
life
in
a
disease
dream
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
kind
of
inspiration
Lydgate
regard
as
rather
vulgar
and
vinous
compare
with
the
imagination
that
reveal
subtle
action
inaccessible
by
any
sort
of
lens
,
but
track
in
that
outer
darkness
through
long
pathway
of
necessary
sequence
by
the
inward
light
which
be
the
last
refinement
of
energy
,
capable
of
bathe
even
the
ethereal
atom
in
its
ideally
illuminate
space
.
 
<EOS>
He
for
his
part
have
toss
away
all
cheap
invention
where
ignorance
find
itself
able
and
at
ease
<EOS>
:
he
be
enamour
of
that
arduous
invention
which
be
the
very
eye
of
research
,
provisionally
frame
its
object
and
correct
it
to
more
and
more
exactness
of
relation
;
he
want
to
pierce
the
obscurity
of
those
minute
process
which
prepare
human
misery
and
joy
,
those
invisible
thoroughfare
which
be
the
first
lurking
-
place
of
anguish
,
mania
,
and
crime
,
that
delicate
poise
and
transition
which
determine
the
growth
of
happy
or
unhappy
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
throw
down
his
book
,
stretch
his
leg
towards
the
ember
in
the
grate
,
and
clasp
his
hand
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
in
that
agreeable
afterglow
of
excitement
when
think
lapse
from
examination
of
a
specific
object
into
a
suffusive
sense
of
its
connection
with
all
the
rest
of
our
existence
 
seem
,
as
it
be
,
to
throw
itself
on
its
back
after
vigorous
swimming
and
float
with
the
repose
of
unexhausted
strength
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
feel
a
triumphant
delight
in
his
study
,
and
something
like
pity
for
those
less
lucky
man
who
be
not
of
his
profession
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
not
take
that
turn
when
I
be
a
lad
,
"
he
think
,
"
I
may
have
get
into
some
stupid
draught
-
horse
work
or
other
,
and
live
always
in
blinker
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
be
happy
in
any
profession
that
do
not
call
forth
the
high
intellectual
strain
,
and
yet
keep
me
in
good
warm
contact
with
my
neighbor
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
the
medical
profession
for
that
:
one
can
have
the
exclusive
scientific
life
that
touch
the
distance
and
befriend
the
old
fogy
in
the
parish
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
hard
for
a
clergyman
:
<EOS>
Farebrother
seem
to
be
an
anomaly
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
thought
bring
back
the
Vincys
and
all
the
picture
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
They
float
in
his
mind
agreeably
enough
,
and
as
he
take
up
his
bed
-
candle
his
lip
be
curl
with
that
incipient
smile
which
be
apt
to
accompany
agreeable
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
ardent
fellow
,
but
at
present
his
ardor
be
absorb
in
love
of
his
work
and
in
the
ambition
of
make
his
life
recognize
as
a
factor
in
the
well
life
of
mankind
 
like
other
hero
of
science
who
have
nothing
but
an
obscure
country
practice
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lydgate
!
<EOS>
or
shall
I
say
,
Poor
Rosamond
!
 
<EOS>
each
live
in
a
world
of
which
the
other
know
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
occur
to
Lydgate
that
he
have
be
a
subject
of
eager
meditation
to
Rosamond
,
who
have
neither
any
reason
for
throw
her
marriage
into
distant
perspective
,
nor
any
pathological
study
to
divert
her
mind
from
that
ruminating
habit
,
that
inward
repetition
of
look
,
word
,
and
phrase
,
which
make
a
large
part
in
the
life
of
most
girl
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
mean
to
look
at
her
or
speak
to
her
with
more
than
the
inevitable
amount
of
admiration
and
compliment
which
a
man
must
give
to
a
beautiful
girl
;
indeed
,
it
seem
to
him
that
his
enjoyment
of
her
music
have
remain
almost
silent
,
for
he
fear
fall
into
the
rudeness
of
tell
her
his
great
surprise
at
her
possession
of
such
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
have
register
every
look
and
word
,
and
estimate
them
as
the
open
incident
of
a
preconceived
romance
 
incident
which
gather
value
from
the
foreseen
development
and
climax
.
 
<EOS>
in
Rosamond
's
romance
it
be
not
necessary
to
imagine
much
about
the
inward
life
of
the
hero
,
or
of
his
serious
business
in
the
world
:
of
course
,
he
have
a
profession
and
be
clever
,
as
well
as
sufficiently
handsome
;
but
the
piquant
fact
about
Lydgate
be
his
good
birth
,
which
distinguish
him
from
all
Middlemarch
admirer
,
and
present
marriage
as
a
prospect
of
rise
in
rank
and
get
a
little
nearer
to
that
celestial
condition
on
earth
in
which
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
vulgar
people
,
and
perhaps
at
last
associate
with
relative
quite
equal
to
the
county
people
who
look
down
on
the
Middlemarchers
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
Rosamond
's
cleverness
to
discern
very
subtly
the
faint
aroma
of
rank
,
and
once
when
she
have
see
the
Miss
Brookes
accompany
their
uncle
at
the
county
assize
,
and
seat
among
the
aristocracy
,
she
have
envy
them
,
notwithstanding
their
plain
dress
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
think
it
incredible
that
to
imagine
Lydgate
as
a
man
of
family
could
cause
thrill
of
satisfaction
which
have
anything
to
do
with
the
sense
that
she
be
in
love
with
him
,
I
will
ask
you
to
use
your
power
of
comparison
a
little
more
effectively
,
and
consider
whether
red
cloth
and
epaulet
have
never
have
an
influence
of
that
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Our
passion
do
not
live
apart
in
lock
chamber
,
but
,
dress
in
their
small
wardrobe
of
notion
,
bring
their
provision
to
a
common
table
and
mess
together
,
feed
out
of
the
common
store
accord
to
their
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
in
fact
,
be
entirely
occupy
not
exactly
with
Tertius
Lydgate
as
he
be
in
himself
,
but
with
his
relation
to
her
;
and
it
be
excusable
in
a
girl
who
be
accustomed
to
hear
that
all
young
man
may
,
could
,
would
be
,
or
actually
be
in
love
with
her
,
to
believe
at
once
that
Lydgate
could
be
no
exception
.
 
<EOS>
His
look
and
word
mean
more
to
her
than
other
man
's
,
because
she
care
more
for
them
:
she
think
of
them
diligently
,
and
diligently
attend
to
that
perfection
of
appearance
,
behavior
,
sentiment
,
and
all
other
elegancie
,
which
would
find
in
Lydgate
a
more
adequate
admirer
than
she
have
yet
be
conscious
of
.
  
<EOS>
for
Rosamond
,
though
she
would
never
do
anything
that
be
disagreeable
to
her
,
be
industrious
;
and
now
more
than
ever
she
be
active
in
sketch
her
landscape
and
market
-
cart
and
portrait
of
friend
,
in
practise
her
music
,
and
in
be
from
morning
till
night
her
own
standard
of
a
perfect
lady
,
have
always
an
audience
in
her
own
consciousness
,
with
sometimes
the
not
unwelcome
addition
of
a
more
variable
external
audience
in
the
numerous
visitor
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
find
time
also
to
read
the
good
novel
,
and
even
the
second
good
,
and
she
know
much
poetry
by
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Her
favorite
poem
be
"
Lalla
Rookh
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
girl
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
a
happy
fellow
who
get
her
!
"
<EOS>
be
the
sentiment
of
the
elderly
gentleman
who
visit
the
Vincys
;
and
the
reject
young
man
think
of
try
again
,
as
be
the
fashion
in
country
town
where
the
horizon
be
not
thick
with
coming
rival
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Plymdale
think
that
Rosamond
have
be
educate
to
a
ridiculous
pitch
,
for
what
be
the
use
of
accomplishment
which
would
be
all
lay
aside
as
soon
as
she
be
married
?
 
<EOS>
while
her
aunt
Bulstrode
,
who
have
a
sisterly
faithfulness
towards
her
brother
's
family
,
have
two
sincere
wish
for
Rosamond
 
that
she
may
show
a
more
serious
turn
of
mind
,
and
that
she
may
meet
with
a
husband
whose
wealth
correspond

the

"
  
<EOS>
the
Rev.
Camden
Farebrother
,
whom
Lydgate
go
to
see
the
next
evening
,
live
in
an
old
parsonage
,
build
of
stone
,
venerable
enough
to
match
the
church
which
it
look
out
upon
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
furniture
too
in
the
house
be
old
,
but
with
another
grade
of
age
 
that
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
father

<EOS>
there
be
paint
white
chair

with
gilding

them

red
silk

there
be
engrave
portrait
of
Lord
Chancellors
and
other
celebrated
lawyer
of

last
century

there

old
pier

glass
to
reflect
them

as
well
as

little
satin

wood
table
and
the
sofa
resemble
a
prolongation
of
uneasy
chair
,
all
stand
in
relief
against

dark
wainscot

this
be
the
physiognomy
of
the
drawing
-
room
into
which
Lydgate
be
show
;
and
there
be
three
lady
to
receive
him
,
who
be
also
old
-
fashioned
,
and
of
a
faded
but
genuine
respectability
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
the
Vicar
's
white
-
haired
mother
,
befrille
and
kerchiefe
with
dainty
cleanliness
,
upright
,
quick
-
eyed
,
and
still
under
seventy
;
Miss
Noble
,
her
sister
,
a
tiny
old
lady
of
meeker
aspect
,
with
frill
and
kerchief
decidedly
more
worn
and
mend
;
and
Miss
Winifred
Farebrother
,
the
Vicar
's
eld
sister
,
well
-
look
like
himself
,
but
nip
and
subdue
as
single
woman
be
apt
to
be
who
spend
their
life
in
uninterrupted
subjection
to
their
elder
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
not
expect
to
see
so
quaint
a
group
:
know
simply
that
Mr.
Farebrother
be
a
bachelor
,
he
have
think
of
be
usher
into
a
snuggery
where
the
chief
furniture
would
probably
be
book
and
collection
of
natural
object
.
 
<EOS>
the
Vicar
himself
seem
to
wear
rather
a
change
aspect
,
as
most
man
do
when
acquaintance
make
elsewhere
see
them
for
the
first
time
in
their
own
home
;
some
indeed
show
like
an
actor
of
genial
part
disadvantageously
cast
for
the
curmudgeon
in
a
new
piece
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
case
with
Mr.
Farebrother
:
he
seem
a
trifle
milder
and
more
silent
,
the
chief
talker
be
his
mother
,
while
he
only
put
in
a
good
-
humored
moderating
remark
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
evidently
accustomed
to
tell
her
company
what
they
ought
to
think
,
and
to
regard
no
subject
as
quite
safe
without
her

it
much

perhaps
she
be
conscious
of
be
tempt
to
steal
from
those
who
have
much
that
she
may
give
to
those
who
have
nothing

carry
in
her
conscience
the

one

know
the
luxury

giving

<EOS>
Mrs.
Farebrother
welcome
the
guest
with
a
lively
formality

precision
.
 
<EOS>
She
presently
inform
him
that
they
be
not
often
in

of
medical
aid
in

house

<EOS>
She
have
bring
up
her
child
to
wear
flannel

not

over

eat
themselves
,
which
last
habit
she
consider
the
chief
reason
why
people
need
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
plead
for
those
whose
father
and
mother
have
over
-
eat
themselves
,
but
Mrs.
Farebrother
hold
that
view
of
thing
dangerous
:
nature
be
more
just
than
that
;
it
would
be
easy
for
any
felon
to
say
that
his
ancestor
ought
to
have
be
hang
instead
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
those
who
have
bad
father

mother
be
bad
themselves
,
they
be
hang
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no

go
back

you

<EOS>
"
My

Third

I

I

when
I

every

now

you

slyly

no

It

<EOS>
I
be
nearly
seventy
,
Mr.

I
go
upon
experience

I

neither

It

not
so
in

a

be

you
may
be
pretty
sure

be

whoever
may

push
him
aside

I
be
proud
to

Mr.

that
he
will
compare
with

not

of
this

which
be

a
low
standard
to
go
by

at

my

probably
,
to

<EOS>
why
be
Camden
in
such
haste

take
a
visitor

there
be
nothing

pickle
vermin

drawer
full
of

with
no
carpet
on

floor

<EOS>
Mr.
Lydgate
must
excuse
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
game
at
cribbage
would
be
far
well
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
plain
that
a
vicar
may
be
adore
by
his
womankind
as
the
king
of
man
and
preacher
,
and
yet
be
hold
by
them
to
stand
in
much
need
of
their
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
with
the
usual
shallowness
of
a
young
bachelor
,
wonder
that
Mr.

have
not
teach
them
better

"
My

Vicar

open

be
indeed

the

more

again

be
begin

wish
that
the
very
good
construction

be
the
true
one

the
Vicar
's
frankness
seem
not
of
the
repulsive
sort
that
come
from
an
uneasy
consciousness

to
forestall
the
judgment
of
other
,
but
simply
the
relief
of
a
desire
to
do
with
as
little
pretence
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
apparently
he
be
not
without
a
sense
that
his
freedom
of
speech
may
seem
premature

he
presently
say

I
have
not

you

divine
some
delicacy

feeling
here

do
not

understand
it

the
way

I
make
up
my

some

do
with

little
of

that
be
why
I

I
do
not

I
see
when
I
be
study
there
 
so
much
empty
bigwiggism

obstructive
trickery
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
country
,
people
have
less
pretension

knowledge

be
less
of
companion

for
that
reason
they
affect
one
's
amour

propre
less

one
make
less
bad

can
follow

quietly

you
have
get

You

you

say
Mr.

quite

I
do
not

<EOS>
I
be
oppose

way

do
not

narrow
ignorant
set

do
more
to
make

uncomfortable
than
to
make
them
better

system
be
a
sort
of
worldly

spiritual

they
really
look
on

mankind
as
a

carcass

smilingly

I
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
be
not
at
all
sure
that
the
Vicar
malign
himself

<EOS>
a
model
clergyman
,
like
a
model
doctor

ought
to
think
his
own
profession
the
fine
in

take
all

moral

I

no

both
statement
be
true

then
I
could

glad

that
be
the
plain
fact

case

let
us
dismiss
it

only
want
to
tell

you

<EOS>
some
week
pass
after
this
conversation
before
the
question
of
the
chaplaincy
gather
any
practical
import
for
Lydgate
,
and
without
tell
himself
the
reason
,
he
defer
the
predetermination
on
which
side
he
should
give
his
vote
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
really
have
be
a
matter
of
total
indifference
to
him
 
that
be
to
say
,
he
would
have
take
the
more
convenient
side
,
and
give
his
vote
for
the
appointment
of
Tyke
without
any
hesitation
 
if
he
have
not
care
personally
for
Mr.
Farebrother
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
liking
for
the
Vicar
of
St.
Botolph
's
grow
with
grow
acquaintanceship
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
enter
into
Lydgate
's
position
as
a
new
-
comer
who
have
his
own
professional
object
to
secure
,
Mr.
Farebrother
should
have
take
pain
rather
to
warn
off
than
to
obtain
his
interest
,
show
an
unusual
delicacy
and
generosity
,
which
Lydgate
's
nature
be
keenly
alive
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
go
along
with
other
point
of
conduct
in
Mr.
Farebrother
which
be
exceptionally
fine
,
and
make
his
character
resemble
those
southern
landscape
which
seem
divide
between
natural
grandeur
and
social
slovenliness
.
 
<EOS>
very
few
man
could
have
be
as
filial
and
chivalrous
as
he
be
to
the
mother
,
aunt
,
and
sister
,
whose
dependence
on
him
have
in
many
way
shape
his
life
rather
uneasily
for
himself
;
few
man
who
feel
the
pressure
of
small
need
be
so
nobly
resolute
not
to
dress
up
their
inevitably
self
-
interested
desire
in
a
pretext
of
well
motive
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
matter
he
be
conscious
that
his
life
would
bear
the
close
scrutiny
;
and
perhaps
the
consciousness
encourage
a
little
defiance
towards
the
critical
strictness
of
person
whose
celestial
intimacy
seem
not
to
improve
their
domestic
manner
,
and
whose
lofty
aim
be
not
need
to
account
for
their
action
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
his
preaching
be
ingenious
and
pithy
,
like
the
preaching
of
the
English
Church
in
its
robust
age
,
and
his
sermon
be
deliver
without
book
.
 
<EOS>
People
outside
his
parish
go
to
hear
him
;
and
,
since
to
fill
the
church
be
always
the
most
difficult
part
of
a
clergyman
's
function
,
here
be
another
ground
for
a
careless
sense
of
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
be
a
likable
man
:
sweet
-
tempered
,
ready
-
witted
,
frank
,
without
grin
of
suppress
bitterness
or
other
conversational
flavor
which
make
half
of
us
an
affliction
to
our
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
like
him
heartily
,
and
wish
for
his
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
feel
uppermost
,
he
continue
to
waive
the
question
of
the
chaplaincy
,
and
to
persuade
himself
that
it
be
not
only
no
proper
business
of
his
,
but
likely
enough
never
to
vex
him
with
a
demand
for
his
vote
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
at
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
request
,
be
lay
down
plan
for
the
internal
arrangement
of
the
new
hospital
,
and
the
two
be
often
in
consultation
.
 
<EOS>
the
banker
be
always
presuppose
that
he
could
count
in
general
on
Lydgate
as
a
coadjutor
,
but
make
no
special
recurrence
to
the
come
decision
between
Tyke
and
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
General
Board
of
the
Infirmary
have
meet
,
however
,
and
Lydgate
have
notice
that
the
question
of
the
chaplaincy
be
throw
on
a
council
of
the
director
and
medical
man
,
to
meet
on
the
follow
Friday
,
he
have
a
vexed
sense
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
on
this
trivial
Middlemarch
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
hear
within
him
the
distinct
declaration
that
Bulstrode
be
prime
minister
,
and
that
the
Tyke
affair
be
a
question
of
office
or
no
office
;
and
he
could
not
help
an
equally
pronounce
dislike
to
give
up
the
prospect
of
office
.
 
<EOS>
for
his
observation
be
constantly
confirm
Mr.
Farebrother
's
assurance
that
the
banker
would
not
overlook
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
"
confound
their
petty
politic
!
"
<EOS>
be
one
of
his
thought
for
three
morning
in
the
meditative
process
of
shaving
,
when
he
have
begin
to
feel
that
he
must
really
hold
a
court
of
conscience
on
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
there
be
valid
thing
to
be
say
against
the
election
of
Mr.
Farebrother
<EOS>
:
he
have
too
much
on
his
hand
already
,
especially
consider
how
much
time
he
spend
on
non
-
clerical
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
then
again
it
be
a
continually
repeat
shock
,
disturb
Lydgate
's
esteem
,
that
the
Vicar
should
obviously
play
for
the
sake
of
money
,
like
the
play
indeed
,
but
evidently
like
some
end
which
it
serve
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
contend
on
theory
for
the
desirability
of
all
game
,
and
say
that
Englishmen
's
wit
be
stagnant
for
want
of
them
;
but
Lydgate
feel
certain
that
he
would
have
play
very
much
less
but
for
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
billiard
-
room
at
the
Green
Dragon
,
which
some
anxious
mother
and
wife
regard
as
the
chief
temptation
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
the
Vicar
be
a
first
-
rate
billiard
-
player
,
and
though
he
do
not
frequent
the
Green
Dragon
,
there
be
report
that
he
have
sometimes
be
there
in
the
daytime
and
have
win
money
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
chaplaincy
,
he
do
not
pretend
that
he
care
for
it
,
except
for
the
sake
of
the
forty
pound
.
<EOS>
lydgate
be
no
Puritan
,
but
he
do
not
care
for
play
,
and
win
money
at
it
have
always
seem
a
meanness
to
him
;
besides
,
he
have
an
ideal
of
life
which
make
this
subservience
of
conduct
to
the
gaining
of
small
sum
thoroughly
hateful
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
in
his
own
life
<EOS>
his
want
have
be
supply
without
any
trouble
to
himself
,
and
his
first
impulse
be
always
to
be
liberal
with
half
-
crown
as
matter
of
no
importance
to
a
gentleman
;
it
have
never
occur
to
him
to
devise
a
plan
for
get
half
-
crown
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
know
in
a
general
way
that
he
be
not
rich
,
but
he
have
never
feel
poor
,
and
he
have
no
power
of
imagine
the
part
which
the
want
of
money
play
in
determine
the
action
of
man
.
<EOS>
money
have
never
be
a
motive
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
be
not
ready
to
frame
excuse
for
this
deliberate
pursuit
of
small
gain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
altogether
repulsive
to
him
,
and
he
never
enter
into
any
calculation
of
the
ratio
between
the
Vicar
's
income
and
his
more
or
less
necessary
expenditure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
he
would
not
have
make
such
a
calculation
in
his
own
case
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
the
question
of
voting
have
come
,
this
repulsive
fact
tell
more
strongly
against
Mr.
Farebrother
than
it
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
know
much
well
what
to
do
if
man
's
character
be
more
consistent
,
and
especially
if
one
's
friend
be
invariably
fit
for
any
function
they
desire
to
undertake
!
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
convince
that
if
there
have
be
no
valid
objection
to
Mr.
Farebrother
,
he
would
have
vote
for
him
,
whatever
Bulstrode
may
have
feel
on
the
subject
:
he
do
not
intend
to
be
a
vassal
of
Bulstrode
's
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
there
be
Tyke
,
a
man
entirely
give
to
his
clerical
office
,
who
be
simply
curate
at
a
chapel
of
ease
in
St.
Peter
's
parish
,
and
have
time
for
extra
duty
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
have
anything
to
say
against
Mr.
Tyke
,
except
that
they
could
not
bear
him
,
and
suspect
him
of
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
really
,
from
his
point
of
view
,
Bulstrode
be
thoroughly
justify
.
  
<EOS>
but
whichever
way
Lydgate
begin
to
incline
,
there
be
something
to
make
him
wince
;
and
be
a
proud
man
,
he
be
a
little
exasperate
at
be
oblige
to
wince
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
frustrate
his
own
good
purpose
by
get
on
bad
term
with
Bulstrode
;
he
do
not
like
vote
against
Farebrother
,
and
help
to
deprive
him
of
function
and
salary
;
and
the
question
occur
whether
the
additional
forty
pound
may
not
leave
the
Vicar
free
from
that
ignoble
care
about
win
at
card
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Lydgate
do
not
like
the
consciousness
that
in
voting
for
Tyke
he
should
be
vote
on
the
side
obviously
convenient
for
himself
.
<EOS>
but
would
the
end
really
be
his
own
convenience
?
 
<EOS>
other
people
would
say
so
,
and
would
allege
that
he
be
curry
favor
with
Bulstrode
for
the
sake
of
make
himself
important
and
get
on
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
He
for
his
own
part
know
that
if
his
personal
prospect
simply
have
be
concern
,
he
would
not
have
care
a
rotten
nut
for
the
banker
's
friendship
or
enmity
.
 
<EOS>
what
he
really
care
for
be
a
medium
for
his
work
,
a
vehicle
for
his
idea
;
and
after
all
,
be
he
not
bind
to
prefer
the
object
of
get
a
good
hospital
,
where
he
could
demonstrate
the
specific
distinction
of
fever
and
test
therapeutic
result
,
before
anything
else
connect
with
this
chaplaincy
?
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
Lydgate
be
feel
the
hamper
threadlike
pressure
of
small
social
condition
,
and
their
frustrating
complexity
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
his
inward
debate
,
when
he
set
out
for
the
hospital
,
his
hope
be
really
in
the
chance
that
discussion
may
somehow
give
a
new
aspect
to
the
question
,
and
make
the
scale
dip
so
as
to
exclude
the
necessity
for
voting
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
trust
a
little
also
to
the
energy
which
be
beget
by
circumstance
 
some
feeling
rush
warmly
and
make
resolve
easy
,
while
debate
in
cool
blood
have
only
make
it
more
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
however
it
be
,
he
do
not
distinctly
say
to
himself
on
which
side
he
would
vote
;
and
all
the
while
he
be
inwardly
resent
the
subjection
which
have
be
force
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
seem
beforehand
like
a
ridiculous
piece
of
bad
logic
that
he
,
with
his
unmixed
resolution
of
independence
and
his
select
purpose
,
would
find
himself
at
the
very
outset
in
the
grasp
of
petty
alternative
,
each
of
which
be
repugnant
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
student
's
chamber
,
he
have
prearrange
his
social
action
quite
differently
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
be
late
in
set
out
,
but
Dr.
Sprague
,
the
two
other
surgeon
,
and
several
of
the
director
have
arrive
early
;
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
treasurer
and
chairman
,
be
among
those
who
be
still
absent
.
 
<EOS>
the
conversation
seem
to
imply
that
the
issue
be
problematical
,
and
that
a
majority
for
Tyke
be
not
so
certain
as
have
be
generally
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
physician
,
for
a
wonder
,
turn
out
to
be
unanimous
,
or
rather
,
though
of
different
mind
,
they
concur
in
action
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Sprague
,
the
rugged
and
weighty
,
be
,
as
every
one
have
foresee
,
an
adherent
of
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
more
than
suspect
of
have
no
religion
,
but
somehow
Middlemarch
tolerate
this
deficiency
in
him
as
if
he
have
be
a
Lord
Chancellor
;
indeed
it
be
probable
that
his
professional
weight
be
the
more
believe
in
,
<EOS>
the
world
-
old
association
of
cleverness
with
the
evil
principle
be
still
potent
in
the
mind
even
of
lady
-
patient
who
have
the
strict
idea
of
frilling
and
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
this
negation
in
the
Doctor
which
make
his
neighbor
call
him
hard
-
headed
and
dry
-
witted
;
condition
of
texture
which
be
also
hold
favorable
to
the
storing
of
judgment
connect
with
drug
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
it
be
certain
that
if
any
medical
man
have
come
to
Middlemarch
with
the
reputation
of
have
very
definite
religious
view
,
of
be
give
to
prayer
,
and
of
otherwise
show
an
active
piety
,
there
would
have
be
a
general
presumption
against
his
medical
skill
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
ground
it
be
(
professionally
speak
)
fortunate
for
Dr.
Minchin
that
his
religious
sympathy
be
of
a
general
kind
,
and
such
as
give
a
distant
medical
sanction
to
all
serious
sentiment
,
whether
of
Church
or
Dissent
,
rather
than
any
adhesion
to
particular
tenet
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Bulstrode
insist
,
as
he
be
apt
to
do
,
on
the
Lutheran
doctrine
of
justification
,
as
that
by
which
a
Church
must
stand
or
fall
,
Dr.
Minchin
in
return
be
quite
sure
that
man
be
not
a
mere
machine
or
a
fortuitous
conjunction
of
atom
;
if
Mrs.
Wimple
insist
on
a
particular
providence
in
relation
to
her
stomach
complaint
,
Dr.
Minchin
for
his
part
like
to
keep
the
mental
window
open
and
object
to
fix
limit
;
if
the
unitarian
brewer
jest
about
the
Athanasian
Creed
,
Dr.
Minchin
quote
Pope
's
"
Essay
on
Man
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
object
to
the
rather
free
style
of
anecdote
in
which
Dr.
Sprague
indulge
,
prefer
well
-
sanction
quotation
,
and
like
refinement
of
all
kind
:
<EOS>
it
be
generally
know
that
he
have
some
kinship
to
a
bishop
,
and
sometimes
spend
his
holiday
at
"
the
palace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Minchin
be
soft
-
handed
,
pale
-
complexioned
,
and
of
rounded
outline
,
not
to
be
distinguish
from
a
mild
clergyman
in
appearance
:
whereas
Dr.
Sprague
be
superfluously
tall
;
his
trouser
get
crease
at
the
knee
,
and
show
an
excess
of
boot
at
a
time
when
straps
seem
necessary
to
any
dignity
of
bearing
;
you
hear
him
go
in
and
out
,
and
up
and
down
,
as
if
he
have
come
to
see
after
the
roofing
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
have
weight
,
and
may
be
expect
to
grapple
with
a
disease
and
throw
it
;
while
Dr.
Minchin
may
be
better
able
to
detect
it
lurk
and
to
circumvent
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
enjoy
about
equally
the
mysterious
privilege
of
medical
reputation
,
and
conceal
with
much
etiquette
their
contempt
for
each
other
's
skill
.
 
<EOS>
regard
themselves
as
Middlemarch
institution
,
they
be
ready
to
combine
against
all
innovator
,
and
against
non
-
professional
give
to
interference
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
ground
they
be
both
in
their
heart
equally
averse
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
though
Dr.
Minchin
have
never
be
in
open
hostility
with
him
,
and
never
differ
from
him
without
elaborate
explanation
to
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
who
have
find
that
Dr.
Minchin
alone
understand
her
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
a
layman
who
pry
into
the
professional
conduct
of
medical
man
,
and
be
always
obtrude
his
reform
,
 
though
he
be
less
directly
embarrassing
to
the
two
physician
than
to
the
surgeon
-
apothecary
who
attend
pauper
by
contract
,
be
nevertheless
offensive
to
the
professional
nostril
as
such
;
and
Dr.
Minchin
share
fully
in
the
new
pique
against
Bulstrode
,
excite
by
his
apparent
determination
to
patronize
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
-
establish
practitioner
,
Mr.
Wrench
and
Mr.
Toller
;
be
just
now
stand
apart
and
have
a
friendly
colloquy
,
in
which
they
agree
that
Lydgate
be
a
jackanapes
,
just
make
to
serve
Bulstrode
's
purpose
.
<EOS>
to
non
-
medical
friend
they
have
already
concur
in
praise
the
other
young
practitioner
,
who
have
come
into
the
town
on
Mr.
Peacock
's
retirement
without
further
recommendation
than
his
own
merit
and
such
argument
for
solid
professional
acquirement
as
may
be
gather
from
his
have
apparently
waste
no
time
on
other
branch
of
knowledge
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
Lydgate
,
by
not
dispense
drug
,
intend
to
cast
imputation
on
his
equal
,
and
also
to
obscure
the
limit
between
his
own
rank
as
a
general
practitioner
and
that
of
the
physician
,
who
,
in
the
interest
of
the
profession
,
feel
bind
to
maintain
its
various
grade
,
 
especially
against
a
man
who
have
not
be
to
either
of
the
english
university
and
enjoy
the
absence
of
anatomical
and
bedside
study
there
,
but
come
with
a
libellous
pretension
to
experience
in
Edinburgh
and
Paris
,
where
observation
may
be
abundant
indeed
,
but
hardly
sound
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
on
this
occasion
Bulstrode
become
identify
with
Lydgate
,
and
Lydgate
with
Tyke
;
and
owe
to
this
variety
of
interchangeable
name
for
the
chaplaincy
question
,
diverse
mind
be
enable
to
form
the
same
judgment
concern
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Sprague
say
at
once
bluntly
to
the
group
assemble
when
he
enter
,
"
I
go
for
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
a
salary
,
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
take
it
from
the
Vicar
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
none
too
much
 
have
to
insure
his
life
,
besides
keep
house
,
and
do
a
vicar
's
charity
.
 
<EOS>
put
forty
pound
in
his
pocket
<EOS>
and
you
will
do
no
harm

<EOS>
He
be
a
good
fellow
,
be
Farebrother
,
with
as
little
of
the
parson
about
him
as
will
serve
to
carry
order
.
<EOS>
"

"
Ho

Doctor

"
say
old
Mr.
Powderell
,
a
retire
iron

monger
of
some

his
interjection
be
something
between
a
laugh
and
a
parliamentary
disapproval
;
"
we
must
let
you
have
your

what

the

here
<EOS>
Mr.

He
be

I
should
indeed

<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Tyke
's
opponent
have
not
ask
any
one
to
vote
against
his
conscience

I
believe
,

Mr.
Hackbutt

a
rich
tanner
of
fluent

,
whose
glitter
spectacle
and
erect
hair
be
turn
with
some
severity
towards
innocent
Mr.
Powderell
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
in
my
judgment
it
behove
us
,
as
director
,
to
consider
whether
we
will
regard
it
as
our
whole
business
to
carry
out
proposition
emanate
from
a
single
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Will
any
member
of
the
committee
aver
that
he
would
have
entertain
the
idea
of
displace
the
gentleman
who
have
always
discharge
the
function
of
chaplain
here
,
if
it
have
not
be
suggest
to
him
by
party
whose
disposition
it
be
to
regard
every
institution
of
this
town
as
a
machinery
for
carry
out
their
own
view
?
 
<EOS>
I
tax
no
man
's
motive
:
let
them
lie
between
himself
and
a
high
power
;
but
I
do
say
,
that
there
be
influence
at
work
here
which
be
incompatible
with
genuine
independence

and
that
a
crawl
servility

usually
dictate
by
circumstance

so
conduct
themselves
could
not
afford
either
morally
or
financially
to
avow

<EOS>
I
myself
be
a
layman
,
but
I
have
give
no
inconsiderable
attention
to
the

in

Farebrother
be

lax

these
be
the

Mr.

our

Mr.

who
have
lately
allow
himself

have
never

his

Mr.
Thesiger

Mr.

a

who
,
officiate
at

chapel

have
not
a
cure
of
soul
too
extensive
to
leave
him
ample
time
for

new
duty

<EOS>
It
be
desirable
that
chaplaincy
of
this
kind
should
be
enter
on
with
a
fervent
intention
:
they
be
peculiar
opportunity
for
spiritual
influence
;
and
while
it
be
good
that
a
salary
should
be
allot
,
there
be
the
more
need
for
scrupulous
watching
lest
the
office
should
be
pervert
into
a
mere
question
of
salary
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Thesiger
's
manner
have
so
much
quiet
propriety
that
objector
could
only
simmer
in
silence

<EOS>
Mr.

believe
that
everybody
mean
well

matter

<EOS>
He
have
not
himself
attend

affair
of
the
Infirmary

he
have
a
strong
interest

be
for
the
benefit
of
Middlemarch

be
most
happy
to
meet
the
gentleman
present
on
any
public
question

I

my

in

my

Mr.

in

the
merit

if
any

that

be
about

give

not

I
can

recapitulate
the
consideration

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

"
I

we
all
know

we

<EOS>
any
man
who
want
to
do
justice
do
not
wait
till
the
last
minute
to
hear
both
side

<EOS>
I
have
no

to
lose
,

I
propose
that
the
matter
be
put
to
the
vote
at
once

"
  
<EOS>
a
brief
but
still
hot
discussion
follow
before
each
person
write
"
Tyke
"
or
"
Farebrother
"
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
slip
it
into
a
glass
tumbler
;
and
in
the
mean
time
Mr.
Bulstrode
see
Lydgate
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
that
the
vote
be
equally
divide
at
present
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
a
clear
biting
voice
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
look
up
at
Lydgate
    
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
cast
-
vote
still
to
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
yours
,
Mr.
Lydgate
:
will
you
be
good
enough
to
write
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
thing
be
settle
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Wrench
,
rise
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
how
Mr.
Lydgate
will
vote

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
speak
with
some
peculiar
meaning
,
sir
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
rather
defiantly
,
and
keep
his
pencil
suspend
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
merely
mean
that
you
be
expect
to
vote
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
regard
that
meaning
as
offensive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
offensive
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
desist
from
vote
with
him
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
immediately
write
down
"
Tyke
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
the
Rev.
Walter
Tyke
become
chaplain
to
the
Infirmary
,
and
Lydgate
continue
to
work
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
really
uncertain
whether
Tyke
be
not
the
more
suitable
candidate
,
and
yet
his
consciousness
tell
him
that
if
he
have
be
quite
free
from
indirect
bias
he
should
have
vote
for
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
the
affair
of
the
chaplaincy
remain
a
sore
point
in
his
memory
as
a
case
in
which
this
petty
medium
of
Middlemarch
have
be
too
strong
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
a
man
be
satisfied
with
a
decision
between
such
alternative
and
under
such
circumstance
?
<EOS>
no
more
than
he
can
be
satisfied
with
his
hat
,
which
he
have
choose
from
among
such
shape
as
the
resource
of
the
age
offer
him
,
wear
it
at
best
with
a
resignation
which
be
chiefly
support
by
comparison
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Farebrother
meet
him
with
the
same
friendliness
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
character
of
the
publican
and
sinner
be
not
always
practically
incompatible
with
that
of
the
modern
Pharisee
,
for
the
majority
of
us
scarcely
see
more
distinctly
the
faultiness
of
our
own
conduct
than
the
faultiness
of
our
own
argument
,
or
the
dulness
of
our
own
joke
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Vicar
of
St.
Botolph
's
have
certainly
escape
the
slight
tincture
of
the
Pharisee
,
and
by
dint
of
admit
to
himself
that
he
be
too
much
as
other
man
be
,
he
have
become
remarkably
unlike
them
in
this
 
that
he
could
excuse
other
for
think
slightly
of
him
,
and
could
judge
impartially
of
their
conduct
even
when
it
tell
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
world
have
be
too
strong
for
_
me
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
,
I
know
,
"
he
say
one
day
to
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
then
I
be
not
a
mighty
man
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
a
man
of
renown
.
 
<EOS>
the
choice
of
Hercules
be
a
pretty
fable
;
but
Prodicus
make
it
easy
work
for
the
hero
,
as
if
the
first
resolve
be
enough
.
<EOS>
another
story
say
that
he
come
to
hold
the
distaff
,
and
at
last
wear
the
Nessus
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
one
good
resolve
may
keep
a
man
right
if
everybody
else
's
resolve
help
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Vicar
's
talk
be
not
always
inspirit
:
he
have
escape
be
a
Pharisee
,
but
he
have
not
escape
that
low
estimate
of
possibility
which
we
rather
hastily
arrive
at
as
an
inference
from
our
own
failure
.
<EOS>
Lydgate
think
that
there
be
a
pitiable
infirmity
of
will
in

They
be

near

dreamily

but
she
become
conscious

the
two

suddenly
pause
as

contemplate
the

,
without

immediately
turn
away

advantage
over
most

she

contemplate
her

chiefly
as

new
duty

from

she
have

of

have
a
mind
so
much
above

that

must
often

stupendous
fragmentariness
heighten
the
dreamlike
strangeness

bridal
life

Dorothea
have
now
be
five
week
in
Rome
,
and
in
the
kindly
morning
when
autumn
and
winter
seem
to
go
hand
in

like
a
happy
aged
couple
one

loneliness

drive
about

with
Mr.

of

chiefly
with

choose
to
drive
out
to
the
Campagna

she
could
feel
alone
with
the
earth

away

from
the
oppressive
masquerade

Rome
may
still
be
the
spiritual
centre
and
interpreter
of
the
world

<EOS>
but
let
them
conceive
one
more
historical
contrast
:
the
gigantic
broken
revelation
of
that
Imperial
and
Papal
city
thrust
abruptly
on
the
notion
of
a
girl
who
have
be
bring
up
in
English
and
Swiss
Puritanism
,
feed
on
meagre
protestant
history
and
on
art
chiefly
of
the
hand
-
screen
sort
;
a
girl
whose
ardent
nature
turn
all
her
small
allowance
of
knowledge
into
principle
,
fuse
her
action
into
their
mould

and
whose
quick
emotion
give
the
most
abstract
thing
the
quality
of
a
pleasure

a
pain
;
a
girl
who
have
lately
become
a
wife
,
and
from
the
enthusiastic
acceptance
of
untried
duty
find
herself
plunge
in
tumultuous
preoccupation
with
her
personal
lot

<EOS>
the
weight
of
unintelligible
Rome
may
lie
easily
on
bright
nymph
to
whom
it
form
a
background
for

live

warm

blooded
seem
sink
in
the
deep
degeneracy
of
a
superstition
divorce
from
reverence
;
the
dimmer
but
yet
eager
titanic
life
gaze
and
struggle
on
wall
and
ceiling
;
the
long
vistas
of
white
form
whose
marble
eye
seem
to
hold
the
monotonous
light
of
an
alien
world
:
all
this
vast
wreck
of
ambitious
ideal
,
sensuous
and
spiritual

mix
confusedly
with
the
sign

breathe
forgetfulness
and
degradation
,
at
first
jar
her
as
with
an
electric
shock

and
then
urge

both
pale

possession

prepare
strange
association

Our
mood
be
apt
to
bring
with
them
image
which
succeed
each
other
like
the
magic
-
lantern
picture
of
a
doze
;
and
in
certain
state
of
dull
forlornness
Dorothea
all
her
life
continue
to
see
the
vastness
of
St.
Peter

,
the
huge
bronze
canopy

the
excited
intention
in

everywhere

not
that

find
their

among

while
their

nor
can
I
suppose
that
when
Mrs.

be
discover
in
a
fit

weep
six
week
after

the
situation
will
be

discouragement

faintness

that
element
of
tragedy
which
lie
in
the
very
fact

frequency

have
not

work
itself
into
the
coarse
emotion
of
mankind
;
and
perhaps
our
frame
could
hardly
bear
much
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
have
a
keen
vision
and
feeling
of
all
ordinary
human
life

it
would
be
like

the
grass
grow

of
marriage
often
be
time
of
critical
tumult
 
whether
that
of
a
shrimp
-
pool
or
of
deep
water
 
which
afterwards
subside
into
cheerful
peace
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
not
Mr.
Casaubon
just
as
learn
as
before
?
 
<EOS>
have
his
form
of
expression
change
,
or
his
sentiment
become
less
laudable
?
 
<EOS>
oh
waywardness
of
womanhood
!
<EOS>
do
his
chronology
fail
him
,
or
his
ability
to
state
not
only
a
theory
but
the
name
of
those
who
hold
it
;
or
his
provision
for
give
the
head
of
any
subject
on
demand
?
 
<EOS>
and
be
not
Rome
the
place
in
all
the
world
to
give
free
play
to
such
accomplishment
?
 
<EOS>
besides
,
have
not
Dorothea
's
enthusiasm
especially
dwell
on
the
prospect
of
relieve
the
weight
and
perhaps
the
sadness
with
which
great
task
lie
on
him
who
have
to
achieve
them
?
   
<EOS>
and
that
such
weight
press
on
Mr.
Casaubon
be
only
plainer
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
be
crush
question
;
but
whatever
else
remain
the
same
,
the
light
have
change
,
and
you
can
not
find
the
pearly
dawn
at
noonday
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
unalterable
,
that
a
fellow
-
mortal
with
whose
nature
you
be
acquaint
solely
through
the
brief
entrance
and
exit
of
a
few
imaginative
week
call
courtship
,
may
,
when
see
in
the
continuity
of
married
companionship
,
be
disclose
as
something
well
or
bad
than
what
you
have
preconceive
,
but
will
certainly
not
appear
altogether
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
astonishing
to
find
how
soon
the
change
be
feel
if
we
have
no
kindre
change
to
compare
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
share
lodging
with
a
brilliant
dinner
-
companion
,
or
to
see
your
favorite
politician
in
the
Ministry
,
may
bring
about
change
quite
as
rapid
:
in
these
case
too
we
begin
by
know
little
and
believe
much
,
and
we
sometimes
end
by
invert
the
quantity
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
such
comparison
may
mislead
,
for
no
man
be
more
incapable
of
flashy
make
-
believe
than
Mr.
Casaubon
:
he
be
as
genuine
a
character
as
any
ruminant
animal
,
and
he
have
not
actively
assist
in
create
any
illusion
about
himself
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
in
the
week
since
her
marriage
,
Dorothea
have
not
distinctly
observe
but
feel
with
a
stifle
depression
,
that
the
large
vistas
and
wide
fresh
air
which
she
have
dream
of
find
in
her
husband
's
mind
be
replace
by
anteroom
and
wind
passage
which
seem
to
lead
nowhither
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
that
in
courtship
everything
be
regard
as
provisional
and
preliminary
,
and
the
small
sample
of
virtue
or
accomplishment
be
take
to
guarantee
delightful
store
which
the
broad
leisure
of
marriage
will
reveal
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
door
-
sill
of
marriage
once
cross
,
expectation
be
concentrate
on
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
have
once
embark
on
your
marital
voyage
,
it
be
impossible
not
to
be
aware
that
you
make
no
way
and
that
the
sea
be
not
within
sight
 
that
,
in
fact
,
you
be
explore
an
enclose
basin
.
  
<EOS>
in
their
conversation
before
marriage
,
Mr.
Casaubon
have
often
dwell
on
some
explanation
or
questionable
detail
of
which
Dorothea
do
not
see
the
bearing
;
but
such
imperfect
coherence
seem
due
to
the
brokenness
of
their
intercourse
,
and
,
support
by
her
faith
in
their
future
,
she
have
listen
with
fervid
patience
to
a
recitation
of
possible
argument
to
be
bring
against
Mr.
Casaubon
's
entirely
new
view
of
the
philistine
god
Dagon
and
other
fish
-
deity
,
think
that
hereafter
she
should
see
this
subject
which
touch
him
so
nearly
from
the
same
high
ground
whence
doubtless
it
have
become
so
important
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
the
matter
-
of
-
course
statement
and
tone
of
dismissal
with
which
he
treat
what
to
her
be
the
most
stirring
thought
,
be
easily
account
for
as
belong
to
the
sense
of
haste
and
preoccupation
in
which
she
herself
share
during
their
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
since
they
have
be
in
Rome
,
with
all
the
depth
of
her
emotion
rouse
to
tumultuous
activity
,
and
with
life
make
a
new
problem
by
new
element
<EOS>
,
she
have
be
become
more
and
more
aware
,
with
a
certain
terror
,
that
her
mind
be
continually
slide
into
inward
fit
of
anger
and
repulsion
,
or
else
into
forlorn
weariness
.
 
<EOS>
how
far
the
judicious
Hooker
or
any
other
hero
of
erudition
would
have
be
the
same
at
Mr.
Casaubon
's
time
of
life
,
she
have
no
means
of
knowing
,
so
that
he
could
not
have
the
advantage
of
comparison
;
but
her
husband
's
way
of
comment
on
the
strangely
impressive
object
around
them
have
begin
to
affect
her
with
a
sort
of
mental
shiver
:
he
have
perhaps
the
good
intention
of
acquit
himself
worthily
,
but
only
of
acquit
himself
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
fresh
to
her
mind
be
wear
out
to
his
;
and
such
capacity
of
thought
and
feeling
as
have
ever
be
stimulate
in
him
by
the
general
life
of
mankind
have
long
shrink
to
a
sort
of
dry
preparation
,
a
lifeless
embalmment
of
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
say
,
"
do
this
interest
you
,
Dorothea
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
stay
a
little
longer
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
stay
if
you
wish
it
,
"
 
it
seem
to
her
as
if
go
or
stay
be
alike
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
"
Should
you
like
to
go
to
the
Farnesina
,
Dorothea
?
 
<EOS>
It
contain
celebrated
frescos
design
or
paint
by
Raphael
,
which
most
person
think
it
worth
while
to
visit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
you
care
about
them
?
<EOS>
"
be
always
Dorothea
's
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
I
believe
,
highly
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
represent
the
fable
of
Cupid
and
Psyche
,
which
be
probably
the
romantic
invention
of
a
literary
period
,
and
can
not
,
I
think
,
be
reckon
as
a
genuine
mythical
product
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
like
these
wall
-
painting
we
can
easily
drive
thither
;
and
you
will
then
,
I
think
,
have
see
the
chief
work
of
Raphael
,
any
of
which
it
be
a
pity
to
omit
in
a
visit
to
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
painter
who
have
be
hold
to
combine
the
most
complete
grace
of
form
with
sublimity
of
expression
.
 
<EOS>
such
at
least
I
have
gather
to
be
the
opinion
of
cognoscenti
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
kind
of
answer
give
in
a
measured
official
tone
,
as
of
a
clergyman
read
accord
to
the
rubric
,
do
not
help
to
justify
the
glory
of
the
Eternal
City
,
or
to
give
her
the
hope
that
if
she
know
more
about
them
the
world
would
be
joyously
illuminate
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
any
contact
more
depressing
to
a
young
ardent
creature
than
that
of
a
mind
in
which
year
full
of
knowledge
seem
to
have
issue
in
a
blank
absence
of
interest
or
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
on
other
subject
indeed
Mr.
Casaubon
show
a
tenacity
of
occupation
and
an
eagerness
which
be
usually
regard
as
the
effect
of
enthusiasm
,
and
Dorothea
be
anxious
to
follow
this
spontaneous
direction
of
his
thought
,
instead
of
be
make
to
feel
that
she
drag
him
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
gradually
cease
to
expect
with
her
former
delightful
confidence
that
she
should
see
any
wide
opening
where
she
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
himself
be
lose
among
small
closet
and
wind
stair
,
and
in
an
agitate
dimness
about
the
Cabeiri
,
or
in
an
exposure
of
other
mythologist
'
ill
-
consider
parallel
,
easily
lose
sight
of
any
purpose
which
have
prompt
him
to
these
labor
.
 
<EOS>
with
his
taper
stick
before
him
he
forget
the
absence
of
window
,
and
in
bitter
manuscript
remark
on
other
man
's
notion
about
the
solar
deity
,
he
have
become
indifferent
to
the
sunlight
.
  
<EOS>
these
characteristic
,
fix
and
unchangeable
as
bone
in
Mr.
Casaubon
,
may
have
remain
longer
unfelt
by
Dorothea
if
she
have
be
encourage
to
pour
forth
her
girlish
and
womanly
feel
 
if
he
would
have
hold
her
hand
between
his
and
listen
with
the
delight
of
tenderness
and
understanding
to
all
the
little
history
which
make
up
her
experience
,
and
would
have
give
her
the
same
sort
of
intimacy
in
return
,
so
that
the
past
life
of
each
could
be
include
in
their
mutual
knowledge
and
affection
 
or
if
she
could
have
feed
her
affection
with
those
childlike
caress
which
be
the
bent
of
every
sweet
woman
,
who
have
begin
by
shower
kiss
on
the
hard
pate
of
her
bald
doll
,
create
a
happy
soul
within
that
woodenness
from
the
wealth
of
her
own
love
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
Dorothea
's
bent
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
her
yearning
to
know
what
be
afar
from
her
and
to
be
widely
benignant
,
she
have
ardor
enough
for
what
be
near
,
to
have
kiss
Mr.
Casaubon
's
coat
-
sleeve
,
or
to
have
caress
his
shoe
-
latchet
,
if
he
would
have
make
any
other
sign
of
acceptance
than
pronounce
her
,
with
his
unfailing
propriety
,
to
be
of
a
most
affectionate
and
truly
feminine
nature
,
indicate
at
the
same
time
by
politely
reach
a
chair
for
her
that
he
regard
these
manifestation
as
rather
crude
and
startling
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
his
clerical
toilet
with
due
care
in
the
morning
,
he
be
prepare
only
for
those
amenity
of
life
which
be
suit
to
the
well
-
adjust
stiff
cravat
of
the
period
,
and
to
a
mind
weight
with
unpublished
matter
.
  
<EOS>
and
by
a
sad
contradiction
Dorothea
's
idea
and
resolve
seem
like
melt
ice
float
and
lose
in
the
warm
flood
of
which
they
have
be
but
another
form
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
humiliate
to
find
herself
a
mere
victim
of
feeling
,
as
if
she
could
know
nothing
except
through
that
medium
:
all
her
strength
be
scatter
in
fit
of
agitation
,
of
struggle
,
of
despondency
,
and
then
again
in
vision
of
more
complete
renunciation
,
transform
all
hard
condition
into
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothea
!
<EOS>
she
be
certainly
troublesome
 
to
herself
chiefly
;
but
this
morning
for
the
first
time
she
have
be
troublesome
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
begin
,
while
they
be
take
coffee
,
with
a
determination
to
shake
off
what
she
inwardly
call
her
selfishness
,
and
turn
a
face
all
cheerful
attention
to
her
husband
when
he
say
,
"
My
dear
Dorothea
,
we
must
now
think
of
all
that
be
yet
leave
undone
,
as
a
preliminary
to
our
departure
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
return
home
earlier
that
we
may
have
be
at
Lowick
for
the
Christmas
;
but
my
inquiry
here
have
be
protract
beyond
their
anticipate
period
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
,
however
,
that
the
time
here
have
not
be
pass
unpleasantly
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
sight
of
Europe
,
that
of
Rome
have
ever
be
hold
one
of
the
most
striking
and
in
some
respect
edify
.
 
<EOS>
I
well
remember
that
I
consider
it
an
epoch
in
my
life
when
I
visit
it
for
the
first
time
;
after
the
fall
of
Napoleon
,
an
event
which
open
the
continent
to
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
think
it
be
one
among
several
city
to
which
an
extreme
hyperbole
have
be
apply
 
"
see
Rome
and
die
:
"
but
in
your
case
I
would
propose
an
emendation
and
say
,
see
Rome
as
a
bride
,
and
live
henceforth
as
a
happy
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
pronounce
this
little
speech
with
the
most
conscientious
intention
,
blink
a
little
and
sway
his
head
up
and
down
,
and
conclude
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
find
marriage
a
rapturous
state
,
but
he
have
no
idea
of
be
anything
else
than
an
irreproachable
husband
,
who
would
make
a
charming
young
woman
as
happy
as
she
deserve
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
thoroughly
satisfied
with
our
stay
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
with
the
result
so
far
as
your
study
be
concern
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
try
to
keep
her
mind
fix
on
what
most
affect
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
that
peculiar
pitch
of
voice
which
make
the
word
half
a
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
lead
farther
than
I
have
foresee
,
and
various
subject
for
annotation
have
present
themselves
which
,
though
I
have
no
direct
need
of
them
,
I
could
not
pretermit
.
<EOS>
the
task
,
notwithstanding
the
assistance
of
my
amanuensis
,
have
be
a
somewhat
laborious
one
,
but
your
society
have
happily
prevent
me
from
that
too
continuous
prosecution
of
thought
beyond
the
hour
of
study
which
have
be
the
snare
of
my
solitary
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
that
my
presence
have
make
any
difference
to
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
who
have
a
vivid
memory
of
evening
in
which
she
have
suppose
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mind
have
go
too
deep
during
the
day
to
be
able
to
get
to
the
surface
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
there
be
a
little
temper
in
her
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
when
we
get
to
Lowick
,
I
shall
be
more
useful
to
you
,
and
be
able
to
enter
a
little
more
into
what
interest
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
doubtless
,
my
dear

"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
a
slight
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
note
I
have
here
make
will
want
sift

you
can
,
if
you
please

extract
them
under
my
direction
.
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
and
all
your
note
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
whose
heart
have
already
burn
within
her
on
this
subject
,
so
that
now
she
could
not
help
speak
with
her
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
those
row
of
volume
 
<EOS>
will
you
not
now
do
what
you
use
to
speak
of
?
 
<EOS>
will
you
not
make
up
your
mind
what
part
of
them
you
will
use
,
and
begin
to
write
the
book
which
will
make
your
vast
knowledge
useful
to
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
your
dictation
,
or
I
will
copy
and
extract
what
you
tell
me
:
<EOS>
I
can
be
of
no
other

<EOS>
"
Dorothea
,
in
a
most
unaccountable
,
darkly
feminine
manner
,
end
with
a
slight
sob
and
eye
full
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
the
excessive
feeling
manifest
would
alone
have
be
highly
disturbing
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
but
there
be
other
reason
why
Dorothea
's
word
be
among
the
most
cutting
and
irritate
to
him
that
she
could
have
be
impel
to
use
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
as
blind
to
his
inward
trouble
as
he
to
hers
:
she
have
not
yet
learn
those
hide
conflict
in
her
husband
which
claim
our
pity
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
listen
patiently
to
his
heartbeat
,
but
only
feel
that
her
own
be
beat
violently
.
 
<EOS>
in
Mr.
Casaubon
's
ear
,
Dorothea
's
voice
give
loud
emphatic
iteration
to
those
muffle
suggestion
of
consciousness
which
it
be
possible
to
explain
as
mere
fancy
,
the
illusion
of
exaggerated
sensitiveness
:
always
when
such
suggestion
be
unmistakably
repeat
from
without
,
they
be
resist
as
cruel
and
unjust
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
anger
even
by
the
full
acceptance
of
our
humiliating
confession
 
how
much
more
by
hear
in
hard
distinct
syllable
from
the
lip
of
a
near
observer
,
those
confuse
murmur
which
we
try
to
call
morbid
,
and
strive
against
as
if
they
be
the
oncoming
of
numbness
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
cruel
outward
accuser
be
there
in
the
shape
of
a
wife
 
nay
,
of
a
young
bride
,
who
,
instead
of
observe
his
abundant
pen
-
scratch
and
amplitude
of
paper
with
the
uncritical
awe
of
an
elegant
-
minded
canary
-
bird
,
seem
to
present
herself
as
a
spy
watch
everything
with
a
malign
power
of
inference
.
<EOS>
here
,
towards
this
particular
point
of
the
compass
,
Mr.
Casaubon
have
a
sensitiveness
to
match
Dorothea
's
,
and
an
equal
quickness
to
imagine
more
than
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
formerly
observe
with
approbation
her
capacity
for
worship
the
right
object
;
he
now
foresaw
with
sudden
terror
that
this
capacity
may
be
replace
by
presumption
,
this
worship
by
the
most
exasperating
of
all
criticism
,
 
that
which
see
vaguely
a
great
many
fine
end
,
and
have
not
the
least
notion
what
it
cost
to
reach
them
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
since
Dorothea
have
know
him
,
Mr.
Casaubon
's
face
have
a
quick
angry
flush
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
he
say
,
with
irritation
rein
in
by
propriety
,
"
you
may
rely
upon
me
for
know
the
time
and
the
season
,
adapt
to
the
different
stage
of
a
work
which
be
not
to
be
measure
by
the
facile
conjecture
of
ignorant
onlooker
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
easy
for
me
to
gain
a
temporary
effect
by
a
mirage
of
baseless
opinion
;
but
it
be
ever
the
trial
of
the
scrupulous
explorer
to
be
salute
with
the
impatient
scorn
of
chatterer
who
attempt
only
the
small
achievement
,
be
indeed
equip
for
no
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
well
if
all
such
could
be
admonish
to
discriminate
judgment
of
which
the
true
subject
-
matter
lie
entirely
beyond
their
reach
,
from
those
of
which
the
element
may
be
compass
by
a
narrow
and
superficial
survey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
speech
be
deliver
with
an
energy
and
readiness
quite
unusual
with
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
indeed
entirely
an
improvisation
,
but
have
take
shape
in
inward
colloquy
,
and
rush
out
like
the
round
grain
from
a
fruit
when
sudden
heat
crack
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
not
only
his
wife
:
she
be
a
personification
of
that
shallow
world
which
surround
the
appreciated
or
desponding
author
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
indignant
in
her
turn
.
 
<EOS>
have
she
not
be
repress
everything
in
herself
except
the
desire
to
enter
into
some
fellowship
with
her
husband
's
chief
interest
?
  
<EOS>
"
My
judgment
_
be
_
a
very
superficial
one
 
<EOS>
such
as
I
be
capable
of
form
,
"
she
answer
,
with
a
prompt
resentment
,
that
need
no
rehearsal
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
show
me
the
row
of
notebook
 
you
have
often
speak
of
them
 
<EOS>
you
have
often
say
that
they
want
digest
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
hear
you
speak
of
the
writing
that
be
to
be
publish
.
 
<EOS>
those
be
very
simple
fact
,
and
my
judgment
go
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
beg
you
to
let
me
be
of
some
good
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
rise
to
leave
the
table
and
Mr.
Casaubon
make
no
reply
,
take
up
a
letter
which
lie
beside
him
as
if
to
reperuse
it
.
 
<EOS>
both
be
shock
at
their
mutual
situation
 
that
each
should
have
betray
anger
towards
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
have
be
at
home
,
settle
at
Lowick
in
ordinary
life
among
their
neighbor
,
the
clash
would
have
be
less
embarrassing
:
<EOS>
but
on
a
wedding
journey
,
the
express
object
of
which
be
to
isolate
two
people
on
the
ground
that
they
be
all
the
world
to
each
other
,
the
sense
of
disagreement
be
,
to
say
the
least
,
confound
and
stultifying
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
change
your
longitude
extensively
and
place
yourself
in
a
moral
solitude
in
order
to
have
small
explosion
,
to
find
conversation
difficult
and
to
hand
a
glass
of
water
without
look
,
can
hardly
be
regard
as
satisfactory
fulfilment
even
to
the
tough
mind
.
 
<EOS>
to
Dorothea
's
inexperienced
sensitiveness
,
it
seem
like
a
catastrophe
,
change
all
prospect
;
and
to
Mr.
Casaubon
it
be
a
new
pain
,
he
never
have
be
on
a
wedding
journey
before
,
or
find
himself
in
that
close
union
which
be
more
of
a
subjection
than
he
have
be
able
to
imagine
,
since
this
charming
young
bride
not
only
oblige
him
to
much
consideration
on
her
behalf
(
which
he
have
sedulously
give
)
,
but
turn
out
to
be
capable
of
agitate
him
cruelly
just
where
he
most
need
soothe
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
get
a
soft
fence
against
the
cold
,
shadowy
,
unapplausive
audience
of
his
life
,
have
he
only
give
it
a
more
substantial
presence
?
  
<EOS>
neither
of
them
feel
it
possible
to
speak
again
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
reverse
a
previous
arrangement
and
decline
to
go
out
would
have
be
a
show
of
persistent
anger
which
Dorothea
's
conscience
shrink
from
,
see
that
she
already
begin
to
feel
herself
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
however
just
her
indignation
may
be
,
her
ideal
be
not
to
claim
justice
,
but
to
give
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
the
carriage
come
to
the
door
,
she
drive
with
Mr.
Casaubon
to
the
Vatican
,
walk
with
him
through
the
stony
avenue
of
inscriptions
,
and
when
she
part
with
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
Library
,
go
on
through
the
Museum
out
of
mere
listlessness
as
to
what
be
around
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
spirit
to
turn
round
and
say
that
she
would
drive
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
when
Mr.
Casaubon
be
quit
her
that
Naumann
have
first
see
her
,
and
he
have
enter
the
long
gallery
of
sculpture
at
the
same
time
with
her
;
but
here
Naumann
have
to
await
Ladislaw
with
whom
he
be
to
settle
a
bet
of
champagne
about
an
enigmatical
mediaeval
-
looking
figure
there
.
 
<EOS>
after
they
have
examine
the
figure
,
and
have
walk
on
finish
their
dispute
,
they
have
part
,
ladislaw
linger
behind
while
Naumann
have
go
into
the
Hall
of
Statues
where
he
again
see
Dorothea
,
and
see
her
in
that
brood
abstraction
which
make
her
pose
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
really
see
the
streak
of
sunlight
on
the
floor
more
than
she
see
the
statue
:
she
be
inwardly
see
the
light
of
year
to
come
in
her
own
home
and
over
the
english
field
and
elm
and
hedge
-
bordered
highroad
;
and
feeling
that
the
way
in
which
they
may
be
fill
with
joyful
devotedness
be
not
so
clear
to
her
as
it
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
Dorothea
's
mind
there
be
a
current
into
which
all
think
and
feeling
be
apt
sooner
or
later
to
flow
 
the
reach
forward
of
the
whole
consciousness
towards
the
full
truth
,
the
least
partial
good
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
clearly
something
well
than
anger
and
despondency
.
        
<EOS>
"
hire
facounde
eke
full
womanly
and
plain
,
     
no
contrefeted
terme
have
she
     
<EOS>
to
seman
wise
.
"
                          
<EOS>
CHAUCER
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
that
way
Dorothea
come
to
be
sob
as
soon
as
she
be
securely
alone
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
presently
rouse
by
a
knock
at
the
door
,
which
make
her
hastily
dry
her
eye
before
say
,
"
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
Tantripp
have
bring
a
card
,
and
say
that
there
be
a
gentleman
wait
in
the
lobby
.
 
<EOS>
the
courier
have
tell
him
that
only
Mrs.
Casaubon
be
at
home
,
but
he
say
he
be
a
relation
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
:
would
she
see
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
without
pause
;
"
show
him
into
the
salon
.
"
<EOS>
Her
chief
impression
about
young
Ladislaw
be
that
when
she
have
see
him
at
Lowick
she
have
be
make
aware
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
generosity
towards
him
,
and
also
that
she
have
be
interested
in
his
own
hesitation
about
his
career
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
alive
to
anything
that
give
her
an
opportunity
for
active
sympathy
,
and
at
this
moment
it
seem
as
if
the
visit
have
come
to
shake
her
out
of
her
self
-
absorb
discontent
 
to
remind
her
of
her
husband
's
goodness
,
and
make
her
feel
that
she
have
now
the
right
to
be
his
helpmate
in
all
kind
deed
.
 
<EOS>
She
wait
a
minute
or
two
,
but
when
she
pass
into
the
next
room
there
be
just
sign
enough
that
she
have
be
cry
to
make
her
open
face
look
more
youthful
and
appealing
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
She
meet
Ladislaw
with
that
exquisite
smile
of
good
<EOS>
-
will
which
be
unmixed
with
vanity
,
and
hold
out
her
hand
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
elder
by
several
year
,
but
at
that
moment
he
look
much
the
young
,
for
his
transparent
complexion
flush
suddenly
,
and
he
speak
with
a
shyness
extremely
unlike
the
ready
indifference
of
his
manner
with
his
male
companion
,
while
Dorothea
become
all
the
calm
with
a
wonder
desire
to
put
him
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
aware
that
you

morning

I
be
sure

say
Dorothea

seat
herself
unthinkingly
between
the
fire
and
the
light
of
the
tall
window
,
and
point
to
a
chair
opposite
,
with
the
quietude
of
a
benignant
matron
.
 
<EOS>
the
sign
of
girlish
sorrow
in
her
face
be
only
the
more
striking
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Casaubon
be
much
engaged
;

you
will
leave
your
address
 
will
you
not

he
will
write
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
You

very
good

have
alter
her

you
will
allow
me
I

an
hour

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
go
to
read
in
the
Library
of
the
Vatican
every
day
,
and
you
can
hardly
see
him
except
by
an
appointment

<EOS>
especially
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
about
to
leave
Rome
,
and
he
be
very
busy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
usually
away
almost
from
breakfast
till
dinner
.
 
<EOS>

I
be
sure
he
will
wish
you
to
dine
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
be
strike
mute
for
a
few
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
fond
of
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
sense
of
obligation
,
would
have
laugh
at
him
as
a
bat
of
erudition
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
idea
of
this
dry
-
up
pedant
,
this
elaborator
of
small
explanation
about
as
important
as
the
surplus
stock
of
false
antiquity
keep
in
a
vendor
's
back
chamber
,
have
first
get
this
adorable
young
creature
to
marry
him
,
and
then
pass
his
honeymoon
away
from
her
,
grope
after
his
mouldy
futility
(
Will
be
give
to
hyperbole
)
 
<EOS>
this
sudden
picture
stir
him
with
a
sort
of
comic
disgust
:
he
be
divide
between
the
impulse
to
laugh
aloud
and
the
equally
unseasonable
impulse
to
burst
into
scornful
invective
.
  
<EOS>
for
an
instant
he
feel
that
the
struggle
,
be
cause
a
queer
contortion
of
his
mobile
feature
,
but
with
a
good
effort
he
resolve
it
into
nothing
more
offensive
than
a
merry
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
wonder
;
but
the
smile
be
irresistible
,
and
shine
back
from
her
face
too
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
's
smile
be
delightful
,
unless
you
be
angry
with
him
beforehand
:
it
be
a
gush
of
inward
light
illuminate
the
transparent
skin
as
well
as
the
eye
,
and
play
about
every
curve
and
line
as
if
some
Ariel
be
touch
them
with
a
new
charm
,
and
banish
forever
the
trace
of
moodiness
.
 
<EOS>
the
reflection
of
that
smile
could
not
but
have
a
little
merriment
in
it
too
,
even
under
dark
eyelash
still
moist
,
as
Dorothea
say
inquiringly
,
"
something
amuse
you

yes

quick

wonder
still
more

you

admire
Will

good

humor

"
I
must
have
say
so
only
because

my
uncle
tell
me
all
judge
think
very
fine
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
go
about
with
just
the
same
ignorance
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
there
be
comparatively
few
painting
that
I
can
really
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
when
I
enter
a
room
where
the
wall
be
cover
with
frescos
,
or
with
rare
picture
,
I
feel
a
kind
of
awe
 
like
a
child
present
at
great
ceremony
where
there
be
grand
robe
and
procession
;
I
feel
myself
in
the
presence
of
some
high
life
than
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
begin
to
examine
the
picture
one
by
one
the
life
go
out
of
them
,
or
else
be
something
violent
and
strange
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
my
own
dulness
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
see
so
much
all
at
once
,
and
not
understand
half
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
always
make
one
feel
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
painful
to
be
tell
that
anything
be
very
fine
and
not
be
able
to
feel
that
it
be
fine
 
<EOS>
something
like
be
blind
,
while
people
talk
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
a
great
deal
in
the
feeling
for
art
which
must
be
acquire
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
(
It
be
impossible
now
to
doubt
the
directness
of
Dorothea
's
confession
.
)
<EOS>
"
art
be
an
old
language
with
a
great
many
artificial
affect
style
,
and
sometimes
the
chief
pleasure
one
get
out
of
know
them
be
the
mere
sense
of
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
enjoy
the
art
of
all
sort
here
immensely
;
but
I
suppose
if
I
could
pick
my
enjoyment
to
piece
I
should
find
it
make
up
of
many
different
thread
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
daub
a
little
one
's
self
,
and
have
an
idea
of
the
process
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
perhaps
to
be
a
painter
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
a
new
direction
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
make
paint
your
profession
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
will
like
to
hear
that
you
have
choose
a
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
oh
no
,
"
say
Will
,
with
some
coldness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
quite
make
up
my
mind
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
one
-
side
a
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
see
a
great
deal
of
the
german
artist
here
<EOS>
:
I
travel
from
Frankfort
with
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
fine
<EOS>
,
even
brilliant
fellow
 
but
I
should
not
like
to
get
into
their
way
of
look
at
the
world
entirely
from
the
studio
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
understand
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
in
Rome
it
seem
as
if
there
be
so
many
thing
which
be
more
wanted
in
the
world
than
picture
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
have
a
genius
for
painting
,
would
it
not
be
right
to
take
that
as
a
guide
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
do
well
thing
than
these
 
or
different
,
so
that
there
may
not
be
so
many
picture
almost
all
alike
in
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
this
simplicity
,
and
Will
be
win
by
it
into
frankness
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
man
must
have
a
very
rare
genius
to
make
change
of
that
sort
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
mine
would
not
carry
me
even
to
the
pitch
of
do
well
what
have
be
do
already
,
at
least
not
so
well
as
to
make
it
worth
while
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
should
never
succeed
in
anything
by
dint
of
drudgery
.
 
<EOS>
if
thing
do
not
come
easily
to
me
I
never
get
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
Mr.
Casaubon
say
that
he
regret
your
want
of
patience
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
gently
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
rather
shocked
at
this
mode
of
take
all
life
as
a
holiday
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
know
Mr.
Casaubon
's
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
I
differ
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
slight
streak
of
contempt
in
this
hasty
reply
offend
Dorothea
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
the
more
susceptible
about
Mr.
Casaubon
because
of
her
morning
's
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
you
differ
,
"
she
say
,
rather
proudly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
of
compare
you
:
<EOS>
such
power
of
persevere
devoted
labor
as
Mr.
Casaubon
's
be
not
common
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
see
that
she
be
offend
,
but
this
only
give
an
additional
impulse
to
the
new
irritation
of
his
latent
dislike
towards
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
intolerable
that
Dorothea
should
be
worship
this
husband
:
<EOS>
such
weakness
in
a
woman
be
pleasant
to
no
man
but
the
husband
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
mortal
be
easily
tempt
to
pinch
the
life
out
of
their
neighbor
's
buzzing
glory
,
and
think
that
such
killing
be
no
murder
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
he
answer
,
promptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
it
be
a
pity
that
it
should
be
throw
away
,
as
so
much
english
scholarship
be
,
for
want
of
know
what
be
be
do
by
the
rest
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Casaubon
read
German
he
would
save
himself
a
great
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
startled
and
anxious
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
merely
mean
,
"
say
Will
,
in
an
offhand
way
,
"
that
the
Germans
have
take
the
lead
in
historical
inquiry
,
and
they
laugh
at
result
which
be
get
by
grope
about
in
wood
with
a
pocket
-
compass
while
they
have
make
good
road
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
with
Mr.
Casaubon
I
see
that
he
deafen
himself
in
that
direction
:
it
be
almost
against
his
will
that
he
read
a
latin
treatise
write
by
a
German
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
only
think
of
give
a
good
pinch
that
would
annihilate
that
vaunted
laboriousness
,
and
be
unable
to
imagine
the
mode
in
which
Dorothea
would
be
wound
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Mr.
Ladislaw
be
not
at
all
deep
himself
in
german
writer
;
but
very
little
achievement
be
require
in
order
to
pity
another
man
's
shortcoming
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothea
feel
a
pang
at
the
thought
that
the
labor
of
her
husband
's
life
may
be
void
,
which
leave
her
no
energy
to
spare
for
the
question
whether
this
young
relative
who
be
so
much
oblige
to
him
ought
not
to
have
repress
his
observation
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
speak
,
but
sit
look
at
her
hand
,
absorb
in
the
piteousness
of
that
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Will
,
however
,
have
give
that
annihilate
pinch
,
be
rather
ashamed
,
imagine
from
Dorothea
's
silence
that
he
have
offend
her
still
more
;
and
have
also
a
conscience
about
pluck
the
tail
-
feather
from
a
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
it
especially
,
"
he
resume
,
take
the
usual
course
from
detraction
to
insincere
eulogy
,
"
because
of
my
gratitude
and
respect
towards
my
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
signify
so
much
in
a
man
whose
talent
and
character
be
less
distinguished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
raise
her
eye
,
bright
than
usual
with
excited
feeling
,
and
say
in
her
sad
recitative
,
"
how
I
wish
I
have
learn
German
when
I
be
at
Lausanne
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
german
teacher
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
can
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
new
light
,
but
still
a
mysterious
light
,
for
Will
in
Dorothea
's
last
word
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
how
she
have
come
to
accept
Mr.
Casaubon
 
which
he
have
dismiss
when
he
first
see
her
by
say
that
she
must
be
disagreeable
in
spite
of
appearance
 
<EOS>
be
not
now
to
be
answer
on
any
such
short
and
easy
method
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
else
she
may
be
,
she
be
not
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
coldly
clever
and
indirectly
satirical
,
but
adorably
simple
and
full
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
an
angel
beguile
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
unique
delight
to
wait
and
watch
for
the
melodious
fragment
in
which
her
heart
and
soul
come
forth
so
directly
and
ingenuously
.
 
<EOS>
the
aeolian
harp
again
come
into
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
have
make
some
original
romance
for
herself
in
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
and
if
Mr.
Casaubon
have
be
a
dragon
who
have
carry
her
off
to
his
lair
with
his
talon
simply
and
without
legal
form
,
it
would
have
be
an
unavoidable
feat
of
heroism
to
release
her
and
fall
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
something
more
unmanageable
than
a
dragon
:
he
be
a
benefactor
with
collective
society
at
his
back
,
and
he
be
at
that
moment
enter
the
room
in
all
the
unimpeachable
correctness
of
his
demeanor
,
while
Dorothea
be
look
animate
with
a
newly
rouse
alarm
and
regret
,
and
Will
be
look
animate
with
his
admire
speculation
about
her
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
feel
a
surprise
which
be
quite
unmixed
with
pleasure
,
but
he
do
not
swerve
from
his
usual
politeness
of
greeting
,
when
Will
rise
and
explain
his
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
be
less
happy
than
usual
,
and
this
perhaps
make
him
look
all
the
dimmer
and
more
faded
;
else
,
the
effect
may
easily
have
be
produce
by
the
contrast
of
his
young
cousin
's
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
impression
on
see
<EOS>
Will
be
one
of
sunny
brightness
,
which
add
to
the
uncertainty
of
his
change
expression
.
 
<EOS>
surely
,
his
very
feature
change
their
form
,
his
jaw
look
sometimes
large
and
sometimes
small
;
and
the
little
ripple
in
his
nose
be
a
preparation
for
metamorphosis
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
turn
his
head
quickly
his
hair
seem
to
shake
out
light
,
and
some
person
think
they
see
decide
genius
in
this
coruscation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
,
on
the
contrary
,
stand
rayless
.
  
<EOS>
as
Dorothea
's
eye
be
turn
anxiously
on
her
husband
she
be
perhaps
not
insensible
to
the
contrast
,
but
it
be
only
mingle
with
other
cause
in
make
her
more
conscious
of
that
new
alarm
on
his
behalf
which
be
the
first
stirring
of
a
pity
tenderness
feed
by
the
reality
of
his
lot
and
not
by
her
own
dream
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
be
a
source
of
great
freedom
to
her
that
Will
be
there
;
his
young
equality
be
agreeable
,
and
also
perhaps
his
openness
to
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
an
immense
need
of
some
one
to
speak
to
,
and
she
have
never
before
see
any
one
who
seem
so
quick
and
pliable
,
so
likely
to
understand
everything
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
gravely
hope
that
Will
be
pass
his
time
profitably
as
well
as
pleasantly
in
Rome
 
have
think
his
intention
be
to
remain
in
South
Germany
 
but
beg
him
to
come
and
dine
to
-
morrow
,
when
he
could
converse
more
at
large
:
<EOS>
at
present
he
be
somewhat
weary
.
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
understand
,
and
accept
the
invitation
immediately
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
eye
follow
her
husband
anxiously
,
while
he
sink
down
wearily
at
the
end
of
a
sofa
,
and
rest
his
elbow
support
his
head
and
look
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
flushed
,
and
with
bright
eye
,
she
seat
herself
beside
him
,
and
say
    
"
forgive
me
for
speak
so
hastily
to
you
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
hurt
you
and
make
the
day
more
burdensome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
that
you
feel
that
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
quietly
and
bow
his
head
a
little
,
but
there
be
still
an
uneasy
feeling
in
his
eye
as
he
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
forgive
me
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
a
quick
sob
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
need
for
some
manifestation
of
feeling
she
be
ready
to
exaggerate
her
own
fault
.
 
<EOS>
Would
not
love
see
return
penitence
afar
off
,
and
fall
on
its
neck
and
kiss
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Dorothea
 
"
who
with
repentance
be
not
satisfied
,
be
not
of
heaven
nor
earth
:
"
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
think
me
worthy
to
be
banish
by
that
severe
sentence
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
exert
himself
to
make
a
strong
statement
,
and
also
to
smile
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
silent
,
but
a
tear
which
have
come
up
with
the
sob
would
insist
on
fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
excited
,
my
dear
..
<EOS>
and
I
also
be
feel
some
unpleasant
consequence
of
too
much
mental
disturbance
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
have
it
in
his
thought
to
tell
her
that
she
ought
not
to
have
receive
young
Ladislaw
in
his
absence
:
but
he
abstain
,
partly
from
the
sense
that
it
would
be
ungracious
to
bring
a
new
complaint
in
the
moment
of
her
penitent
acknowledgment
,
partly
because
he
want
to
avoid
further
agitation
of
himself
by
speech
,
and
partly
because
he
be
too
proud
to
betray
that
jealousy
of
disposition
which
be
not
so
exhausted
on
his
scholarly
compeer
that
there
be
none
to
spare
in
other
direction
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
jealousy
which
need
very
little
fire
:
it
be
hardly
a
passion
,
but
a
blight
breed
in
the
cloudy
,
damp
despondency
of
uneasy
egoism
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
time
for
us
to
dress
,
"
he
add
,
look
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
They
both
rise
,
and
there
be
never
any
further
allusion
between
them
to
what
have
pass
on
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
remember
it
to
the
last
with
the
vividness
with
which
we
all
remember
epochs
in
our
experience
when
some
dear
expectation
die
,
or
some
new
motive
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
today
she
have
begin
to
see
that
she
have
be
under
a
wild
illusion
in
expect
a
response
to
her
feeling
from
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
she
have
feel
the
waking
of
a
presentiment
that
there
may
be
a
sad
consciousness
in
his
life
which
make
as
great
a
need
on
his
side
as
on
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
us
bear
in
moral
stupidity
,
take
the
world
as
an
udder
to
feed
our
supreme
self
:
Dorothea
have
early
begin
to
emerge
from
that
stupidity
,
but
yet
it
have
be
easy
to
her
to
imagine
how
she
would
devote
herself
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
become
wise
and
strong
in
his
strength
and
wisdom
,
than
to
conceive
with
that
distinctness
which
be
no
long
reflection
but
feel
 
an
idea
work
back
to
the
directness
of
sense
,
like
the
solidity
of
object
 
that
he
have
an
equivalent
centre
of
self
,
whence
the
light
and
shadow
must
always
fall
with
a
certain
difference

ALFRED
DE
MUSSET
.
  
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
be
delightfully
agreeable
at
dinner
the
next
day
,
and
give
no
opportunity
for
Mr.
Casaubon
to
show
disapprobation
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
it
seem
to
Dorothea
that
Will
have
a
happy
way
of
draw
her
husband
into
conversation
and
of
deferentially
listen
to
him
than
she
have
ever
observe
in
any
one
before
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
listener
about
Tipton
be
not
highly
gifted
!
 
<EOS>
Will
talk
a
good
deal
himself
,
but
what
he
say
be
throw
in
with
such
rapidity
,
and
with
such
an
unimportant
air
of
say
something
by
the
way
,
that
it
seem
a
gay
little
chime
after
the
great
bell
.
 
<EOS>
if
Will
be
not
always
perfect
,
this
be
certainly
one
of
his
good
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
describe
touch
of
incident
among
the
poor
people
in
Rome
,
only
to
be
see
by
one
who
could
move
about
freely
;
he
find
himself
in
agreement
with
Mr.
Casaubon
as
to
the
unsound
opinion
of
Middleton
concern
the
relation
of
Judaism
and
Catholicism
;
and
pass
easily
to
a
half
-
enthusiastic
half
-
playful
picture
of
the
enjoyment
he
get
out
of
the
very
miscellaneousness
of
Rome
,
which
make
the
mind
flexible
with
constant
comparison
,
and
save
you
from
see
the
world
's
age
as
a
set
of
box
-
like
partition
without
vital
connection
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
's
study
,
Will
observe
,
have
always
be
of
too
broad
a
kind
for
that
,
and
he
have
perhaps
never
feel
any
such
sudden
effect
,
but
for
himself
he
confess
that
Rome
have
give
him
quite
a
new
sense
of
history
as
a
whole
:
the
fragment
stimulate
his
imagination
and
make
him
constructive
.
 
<EOS>
then
occasionally
,
but
not
too
often
,
he
appeal
to
Dorothea
,
and
discuss
what
she
say
,
as
if
her
sentiment
be
an
item
to
be
consider
in
the
final
judgment
even
of
the
Madonna
di
Foligno
or
the
Laocoon
.
 
<EOS>
a
sense
of
contribute
to
form
the
world
's
opinion
make
conversation
particularly
cheerful
;
and
Mr.
Casaubon
too
be
not
without
his
pride
in
his
young
wife
,
who
speak
better
than
most
woman
,
as
indeed
he
have
perceive
in
choose
her
.
  
<EOS>
since
thing
be
go
on
so
pleasantly
,
Mr.
Casaubon
's
statement
that
his
labor
in
the
Library
would
be
suspend
for
a
couple
of
day
,
and
that
after
a
brief
renewal
he
should
have
no
further
reason
for
stay
in
Rome
,
encourage
Will
to
urge
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
should
not
go
away
without
see
a
studio
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Would
not
Mr.
Casaubon
take
her
?
 
<EOS>
that
sort
of
thing
ought
not
to
be
miss
:
it
be
quite
special
:
<EOS>
it
be
a
form
of
life
that
grow
like
a
small
fresh
vegetation
with
its
population
of
insect
on
huge
fossil
.
 
<EOS>
Will
would
be
happy
to
conduct
them
 
not
to
anything
wearisome
,
only
to
a
few
example
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
,
see
Dorothea
look
earnestly
towards
him
,
could
not
but
ask
her
if
she
would
be
interested
in
such
visit
:
he
be
now
at
her
service
during
the
whole
day
;
and
it
be
agree
that
Will
should
come
on
the
morrow
and
drive
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Will
could
not
omit
Thorwaldsen
,
a
live
celebrity
about
whom
even
Mr.
Casaubon
inquire
,
but
before
the
day
be
far
advanced
he
lead
the
way
to
the
studio
of
his
friend
Adolf
Naumann
,
whom
he
mention
as
one
of
the
chief
renovator
of
christian
art
,
one
of
those
who
have
not
only
revive
but
expand
that
grand
conception
of
supreme
event
as
mystery
at
which
the
successive
age
be
spectator
,
and
in
relation
to
which
the
great
soul
of
all
period
become
as
it
be
contemporary
.
 
<EOS>
Will
add
that
he
have
make
himself
Naumann
's
pupil
for
the
nonce
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
make
some
oil
-
sketch
under
him
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hate
copying
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
put
something
of
my
own
in
.
 
<EOS>
Naumann
have
be
paint
the
saint
draw
the
car
of
the
Church
,
and
I
have
be
make
a
sketch
of
Marlowe
's
Tamburlaine
drive
the
conquered
king
in
his
Chariot
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
ecclesiastical
as
Naumann
,
and
I
sometimes
twit
him
with
his
excess
of
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
time
I
mean
to
outdo
him
in
breadth
of
intention
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
Tamburlaine
in
his
chariot
for
the
tremendous
course
of
the
world
's
physical
history
lash
on
the
harness
dynasty
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
that
be
a
good
mythical
interpretation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Will
here
look
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
receive
this
offhand
treatment
of
symbolism
very
uneasily
,
and
bow
with
a
neutral
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
sketch
must
be
very
grand
,
if
it
convey
so
much
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
need
some
explanation
even
of
the
meaning
you
give
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
intend
Tamburlaine
to
represent
earthquake
and
volcano
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
"
say
Will
,
laugh
,
"
and
migration
of
race
and
clearing
of
forest
 
and
America
and
the
steam
-
engine
.
<EOS>
everything
you
can
imagine
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
difficult
kind
of
shorthand
!
"
say
Dorothea
,
smile
towards
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
require
all
your
knowledge
to
be
able
to
read
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
blink
furtively
at
Will
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
suspicion
that
he
be
be
laugh
at
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
possible
to
include
Dorothea
in
the
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
Naumann
painting
industriously
,
but
no
model
be
present
;
his
picture
be
advantageously
arrange
,
and
his
own
plain
vivacious
person
set
off
by
a
dove
-
color
blouse
and
a
maroon
velvet
cap
,
so
that
everything
be
as
fortunate
as
if
he
have
expect
the
beautiful
young
english
lady
exactly
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
painter
in
his
confident
English
give
little
dissertation
on
his
finished
and
unfinished
subject
,
seem
to
observe
Mr.
Casaubon
as
much
as
he
do
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
Will
burst
in
here
and
there
with
ardent
word
of
praise
,
mark
out
particular
merit
in
his
friend
's
work
;
and
Dorothea
feel
that
she
be
get
quite
new
notion
as
to
the
significance
of
Madonnas
seat
under
inexplicable
canopied
throne
with
the
simple
country
as
a
background
,
and
of
saint
with
architectural
model
in
their
hand
,
or
knife
accidentally
wedge
in
their
skull
.
 
<EOS>
some
thing
which
have
seem
monstrous
to
her
be
gather
intelligibility
and
even
a
natural
meaning
:
but
all
this
be
apparently
a
branch
of
knowledge
in
which
Mr.
Casaubon
have
not
interested
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
would
rather
feel
that
painting
be
beautiful
than
have
to
read
it
as
an
enigma
;
but
I
should
learn
to
understand
these
picture
sooner
than
yours
with
the
very
wide
meaning
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
speak
to
Will
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
speak
of
my
painting
before
Naumann
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
tell
you
,
it
be
all
pfuscherei
,
which
be
his
most
opprobrious
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
true
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
turn
her
sincere
eye
on
Naumann
,
who
make
a
slight
grimace
and
say
    
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
do
not
mean
it
seriously
with
painting
.
 
<EOS>
His
walk
must
be
belle
-
lettre
.
<EOS>
that
be
wi
-
ide
.
"
  
<EOS>
Naumann
's
pronunciation
of
the
vowel
seem
to
stretch
the
word
satirically
.
 
<EOS>
Will
do
not
half
like
it
,
but
manage
to
laugh
:
and
Mr.
Casaubon
,
while
he
feel
some
disgust
at
the
artist
's
german
accent
,
begin
to
entertain
a
little
respect
for
his
judicious
severity
.
  
<EOS>
the
respect
be
not
diminish
when
Naumann
,
after
draw
Will
aside
for
a
moment
and
look
,
first
at
a
large
canvas
,
then
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
come
forward
again
and
say
    
"
My
friend
Ladislaw
think
you
will
pardon
me
,
sir
,
if
I
say
that
a
sketch
of
your
head
would
be
invaluable
to
me
for
the
St.
Thomas
Aquinas
in
my
picture
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
much
to
ask
;
but
I
so
seldom
see
just
what
I
want
 
the
idealistic
in
the
real
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
astonish
me
greatly
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
his
look
improve
with
a
glow
of
delight
;
"
<EOS>
but
if
my
poor
physiognomy
,
which
I
have
be
accustom
to
regard
as
of
the
common
order
,
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
furnish
some
trait
for
the
angelical
doctor
,
I
shall
feel
honored
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
if
the
operation
will
not
be
a
lengthy
one
;
and
if
Mrs.
Casaubon
will
not
object
to
the
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
for
Dorothea
,
nothing
could
have
please
her
more
,
unless
it
have
be
a
miraculous
voice
pronounce
Mr.
Casaubon
the
wise
and
worthy
among
the
son
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
case
her
totter
faith
would
have
become
firm
again
.
  
<EOS>
Naumann
's
apparatus
be
at
hand
in
wonderful
completeness
,
and
the
sketch
go
on
at
once
as
well
as
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
sit
down
and
subside
into
calm
silence
,
feel
happy
than
she
have
do
for
a
long
while
before
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
about
her
seem
good
,
and
she
say
to
herself
that
Rome
,
if
she
have
only
be
less
ignorant
,
would
have
be
full
of
beauty
:
its
sadness
would
have
be
wing
with
hope
.
 
<EOS>
no
nature
could
be
less
suspicious
than
her
:
when
she
be
a
child
she
believe
in
the
gratitude
of
wasp
and
the
honorable
susceptibility
of
sparrow
,
and
be
proportionately
indignant
when
their
baseness
be
make
manifest
.
  
<EOS>
the
adroit
artist
be
ask
Mr.
Casaubon
question
about
english
polity
,
which
bring
long
answer
,
and
,
Will
meanwhile
have
perch
himself
on
some
step
in
the
background
overlook
all
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Naumann
say
 
"
now
if
I
could
lay
this
by
for
half
an
hour
and
take
it
up
again
 
come
and
look
,
Ladislaw
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
perfect
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
Will
vent
those
adjure
interjection
which
imply
that
admiration
be
too
strong
for
syntax
;
and
Naumann
say
in
a
tone
of
piteous
regret
    
<EOS>
"
ah
 
now
 
if
I
could
but
have
have
more
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
other
engagement
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
ask
it

even
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
us
stay
!
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
nothing
to
do
to

day
except
go
about
,
have
we

"
<EOS>
she
add
,
look
entreatingly
at
Mr.
Casaubon
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
pity
not
to
make
the
head
as
good
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
at
your
service
,
sir
,
in
the
matter
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
polite
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
give
up
the
interior
of
my
head
to
idleness
,
it
be
as
well
that
the
exterior
should
work
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
unspeakably
good
 
<EOS>
now
I
be
happy

"
<EOS>
say
Naumann
,
and
then
go
on
in
german
to
Will
,
point
here
and
there
to
the
sketch
as
if
he
be
consider
that
.
 
<EOS>
put
it
aside
for
a
moment
,
he
look
round
vaguely
,
as
if
seek
some
occupation
for
his
visitor
,
and
afterwards
turn
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
say
    
"
perhaps
the
beautiful
bride
,
the
gracious
lady
,
would
not
be
unwilling
to
let
me
fill
up
the
time
by
try
to
make
a
slight
sketch
of
her
 
not
,
of
course
,
as
you
see
,
for
that
picture
 
only
as
a
single
study

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
,
bowing
,
doubt
not
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
oblige
him
,
and
Dorothea
say
,
at
once
,
"
where
shall
I
put
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Naumann
be
all
apology
in
ask
her
to
stand
,
and
allow
him
to
adjust
her
attitude
,
to
which
she
submit
without
any
of
the
affected
air
and
laugh
frequently
think
necessary
on
such
occasion
,
when
the
painter
say
,
"
It
be
as
Santa
Clara
that
I
want
you
to
stand
 
lean
so
,
with
your
cheek
against
your
hand
 
<EOS>
so
 
look
at
that
stool
,
please
,
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
will
be
divide
between
the
inclination
to
fall
at
the
Saint
's
foot
and
kiss
her
robe
,
and
the
temptation
to
knock
Naumann
down
while
he
be
adjust
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
impudence
and
desecration
,
and
he
repent
that
he
have
bring
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
artist
be
diligent
,
and
Will
recover
himself
move
about
and
occupy
Mr.
Casaubon
as
ingeniously
as
he
could
;
but
he
do
not
in
the
end
prevent
the
time
from
seem
long
to
that
gentleman
,
as
be
clear
from
his
express
a
fear
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
be
tired
.
 
<EOS>
Naumann
take
the
hint
and
say
    
"
now
,
sir
,
if
you
can
oblige
me
again
;
I
will
release
the
lady
-
wife

"
  
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Casaubon
's
patience
hold
out
further
,
and
when
after
all
it
turn
out
that
the
head
of
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
would
be
more
perfect
if
another
sitting
could
be
have
,
it
be
grant
for
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
morrow
Santa
Clara
too
be
retouch
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
all
be
so
far
from
displease
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
that
he
arrange
for
the
purchase
of
the
picture
in
which
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
sit
among
the
doctor
of
the
Church
in
a
disputation
too
abstract
to
be
represent
,
but
listen
to
with
more
or
less
attention
by
an
audience
above
.
 
<EOS>
the
Santa
Clara
,
which
be
speak
of
in
the
second
place
,
Naumann
declare
himself
to
be
dissatisfy
with
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
,
in
conscience
,
engage
to
make
a
worthy
picture
of
it
;
so
about
the
Santa
Clara
<EOS>
the
arrangement
be
conditional
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
dwell
on
Naumann
's
joke
at
the
expense
of
Mr.
Casaubon
that
evening
,
or
on
his
dithyramb
about
Dorothea
's
charm
,
in
all
which
Will
join
,
but
with
a
difference
.
 
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
Naumann
mention
any
detail
of
Dorothea
's
beauty
,
than
Will
got
exasperate
at
his
presumption
<EOS>
:
there
be
grossness
in
his
choice
of
the
most
ordinary
word
,
and
what
business
have
he
to
talk
of
her
lip
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
woman
to
be
speak
of
as
other
woman
be
.
 
<EOS>
Will
could
not
say
just
what
he
think
,
but
he
become
irritable
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
when
after
some
resistance
he
have
consent
to
take
the
Casaubons
to
his
friend
's
studio
,
he
have
be
allure
by
the
gratification
of
his
pride
in
be
the
person
who
could
grant
Naumann
such
an
opportunity
of
study
her
loveliness
 
or
rather
her
divineness
,
for
the
ordinary
phrase
which
may
apply
to
mere
bodily
prettiness
be
not
applicable
to
her
.
<EOS>
(
certainly
all
Tipton
and
its
neighborhood
,
as
well
as
Dorothea
herself
,
would
have
be
surprise
at
her
beauty
be
make
so
much
of
.
<EOS>
in
that
part
of
the
world
Miss
Brooke
have
be
only
a
"
fine
young
woman
.
"
)
  
<EOS>
"
oblige
me
by
let
the
subject
drop
,
Naumann
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Casaubon
be
not
to
be
talk
of
as
if
she
be
a
model
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
Naumann
stare
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Schon
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
talk
of
my
Aquinas
.
 
<EOS>
the
head
be
not
a
bad
type
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
great
scholastic
himself
would
have
be
flatter
to
have
his
portrait
ask
for
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
like
these
starchy
doctor
for
vanity
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
I
think
<EOS>
:
he
care
much
less
for
her
portrait
than
his
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
cursed
white
-
blooded
pedantic
coxcomb
,
"
say
Will
,
with
gnash
impetuosity
.
 
<EOS>
His
obligation
to
Mr.
Casaubon
be
not
know
to
his
hearer
,
but
Will
himself
be
think
of
them
,
and
wish
that
he
could
discharge
them
all
by
a
check
.
  
<EOS>
Naumann
give
a
shrug
and
say
,
"
It
be
good
they
go
away
soon
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
They
be
spoil
your
fine
temper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
Will
's
hope
and
contrivance
be
now
concentrated
on
see
Dorothea
when
she
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
want
her
to
take
more
emphatic
notice
of
him
;
he
only
want
to
be
something
more
special
in
her
remembrance
than
he
could
yet
believe
himself
likely
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
impatient
under
that
open
ardent
good
-
will
,
which
he
see
be
her
usual
state
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
the
remote
worship
of
a
woman
throne
out
of
their
reach
play
a
great
part
in
man
's
life
,
but
in
most
case
the
worshipp
long
for
some
queenly
recognition
,
some
approve
sign
by
which
his
soul
's
sovereign
may
cheer
him
without
descend
from
her
high
place
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
precisely
what
Will
want
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
plenty
of
contradiction
in
his
imaginative
demand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
beautiful
to
see
how
Dorothea
's
eye
turn
with
wifely
anxiety
and
beseech
to
Mr.
Casaubon
:
she
would
have
lose
some
of
her
halo
if
she
have
be
without
that
duteous
preoccupation
;
and
yet
at
the
next
moment
the
husband
's
sandy
absorption
of
such
nectar
be
too
intolerable
;
and
Will
's
longing
to
say
damaging
thing
about
him
be
perhaps
not
the
less
tormenting
because
he
feel
the
strong
reason
for
restrain
it
.
  
<EOS>
Will
have
not
be
invite
to
dine
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
persuade
himself
that
he
be
bind
to
call
,
and
that
the
only
eligible
time
be
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
Mr.
Casaubon
would
not
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
,
who
have
not
be
make
aware
that
her
former
reception
of
Will
have
displease
her
husband
,
have
no
hesitation
about
see
him
,
especially
as
he
may
be
come
to
pay
a
farewell
visit
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
enter
she
be
look
at
some
cameo
which
she
have
be
buy
for
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
She
greet
Will
as
if
his
visit
be
quite
a
matter
of
course
,
and
say
at
once
,
have
a
cameo
bracelet
in
her
hand
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
you
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
understand
all
about
cameo
,
and
can
tell
me
if
these
be
really
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
have
you
with
us
in
choose
them
,

Mr.
Casaubon
object
:
he
think
there
be
not
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
finish
his
work
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
shall
go
away
in
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
uneasy
about
these
cameo
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
and
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
particularly
know
,
but
there
can
be
no
great
mistake
about
these
little
homeric
bit
:
they
be
exquisitely
neat
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
color
be
fine
:
it
will
just
suit
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
they
be
for
my
sister
,
who
have
quite
a
different
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
her
with
me
at
Lowick
:
she
be
light
-
haired
and
very
pretty
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
never
so
long
away
from
each
other
in
our
life
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
great
pet
and
never
be
naughty
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
out
before
I
come
away
<EOS>
that
she
want
me
to
buy
her
some
cameo
,
and
I
should
be
sorry
for
them
not
to
be
good
 
after
their
kind
.
"
<EOS>
Dorothea
add
the
last
word
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
not
to
care
about
cameos
,
"
say
Will
,
seat
himself
at
some
distance
from
her
,
and
observe
her
while
she
close
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
frankly
,
I
do
not
think
them
a
great
object
in
life
,
"
say
Dorothea
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
be
a
heretic
about
art
generally
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
expect
you
to
be
very
sensitive
to
the
beautiful
everywhere

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
be
dull
about
many
thing
,
"

Dorothea
,
simply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
make
life
beautiful
 
<EOS>
I
mean
everybody
's
life

<EOS>
and
then
all
this
immense
expense
of
art
,
that
seem
somehow
to
lie
outside
life
and
make
it
no
well
for
the
world
,
pain
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
spoil
my
enjoyment
of
anything
when
I
be
make
to
think
that
most
people
be
shut
out
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
that
the
fanaticism
of
sympathy
,
"
say
Will
,
impetuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
the
same
of
landscape
,
of
poetry
,
of
all
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
carry
it
out
you
ought
to
be
miserable
in
your
own
goodness
,
and
turn
evil
that
you
may
have
no
advantage
over
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
piety
be
to
enjoy
 
<EOS>
when
you
can

do
the

then
to
save
the
earth
's
character

enjoyment
radiate

<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use

try
and
take
care

all
the
world

that
be
be
take
care
of
when
you
feel
delight
 
in
art
or
in
anything
else

<EOS>
Would
you
turn
all
the
youth
of
the
world
into
a
tragic
chorus
,
wailing
and
moralize
over
misery
?
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
that
you
have
some
false
belief
in
the
virtue
of
misery
,
and
want
to
make
your
life
a
martyrdom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Will
have
go
further
than
he
intend
,
and
check
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
's
thought
be
not
take
just
the
same
direction
as
his
own
,
and
she
answer
without
any
special
emotion
    
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
mistake
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
sad
,
melancholy
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
unhappy
long
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
angry
and
naughty
 
not
like
Celia
:
I
have
a
great
outburst
,
and
then
all
seem
glorious
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
believe
in
glorious
thing
in
a
blind
sort
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
quite
willing
to
enjoy
the
art
here
,
but
there
be
so
much
that
I
do
not
know
the
reason
of
 
so
much
that
seem
to
me
a
consecration
of
ugliness
rather
than
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
the
painting
and
sculpture
may
be
wonderful
,
but
the
feeling
be
often
low
and
brutal
,
and
sometimes
even
ridiculous
.

here

there
I
see
what
take
me
at
once
as
noble
 
<EOS>
something
that
I
may
compare
with
the
Alban
Mountains
or
the
sunset
from
the
pincian
Hill
;
but
that
make
it
the
great
pity
that
there
be
so
little
of
the
good
kind
among
all
that
mass
of
thing
over
which
man
have
toil
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
there
be
always
a
great
deal
of
poor
work

the
rarer
thing
want
that
soil
to
grow
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
take
up
that
think
into
the
chief
current
of
her
anxiety
;
"
I
see
it
must
be
very
difficult
to
do
anything
good
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
feel
since
I
have
be
in
Rome
that
most
of
our
life
would
look
much
ugly
and
more
bungling
than
the
picture
,
if
they
could
be
put
on
the
wall
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
part
her
lip
again
as
if
she
be
go
to
say
more
,
but
change
her
mind
and
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
young
 
<EOS>
it
be
an
anachronism
for
you
to
have
such
thought
,
"
say
Will
,
energetically
,
with
a
quick
shake
of
the
head
habitual
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
as
if
you
have
never
know
any
youth

<EOS>
It
be
monstrous
 
as
if
you
have
have
a
vision
of
Hades
in
your
childhood
,
like
the
boy
in
the
legend
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
bring
up
in
some
of
those
horrible
notion
that
choose
the
sweetest
woman
to
devour
 
like
Minotaurs
.
<EOS>
and
now
you
will
go
and
be
shut
up
in
that
stone
prison
at
Lowick
:
you
will
be
bury
alive
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
savage
to
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
never
have
see
you
than
think
of
you
with
such
a
prospect

<EOS>
"
  
Will
again
fear
that
he
have
go
too
far
;
but
the
meaning
we
attach
to
word
depend
on
our
feeling
,
and
his
tone
of
angry
regret
have
so
much
kindness
in
it
for
Dorothea
's
heart
,
which
have
always
be
give
out
ardor
and
have
never
be
feed
with
much
from
the
live
being
around
her
,
that
she
feel
a
new
sense
of
gratitude
and
answer
with
a
gentle
smile
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
good
of
you
to
be
anxious
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
because
you
do
not
like
Lowick
yourself
<EOS>
:
you
have
set
your
heart
on
another
kind
of
life

<EOS>
but
Lowick
be
my
choose
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
last
sentence
be
speak
with
an
almost
solemn
cadence
,
and
Will
do
not
know
what
to
say
,
since
it
would
not
be
useful
for
him
to
embrace
her
slipper
,
and
tell
her
that
he
would
die
for
her
:
it
be
clear
that
she
require
nothing
of
the
sort
;
and
they
be
both
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
,
when
Dorothea
begin
again
with
an
air
of
say
at
last
what
have
be
in
her
mind
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
again
about
something
you
say
the
other
day

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
half
of
it
your
lively
way
of
speak
:
I
notice
that
you
like
to
put
thing
strongly
;
I
myself
often
exaggerate
when
I
speak
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
say
Will
,
observe
that
she
speak
with
a
timidity
quite
new
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
hyperbolical
tongue
:
it
catch
fire
as
it
go

<EOS>
I
dare
<EOS>
say
I
shall
have
to
retract
.

<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
you
say
about
the
necessity
of
know
german
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
for
the
subject
that
Mr.
Casaubon
be
engage
in

<EOS>
I
have
be
think
about
it

it
seem
to
me
that
with
Mr.
Casaubon
's
learning
he
must
have
before
him
the
same
material
as
german
scholar
 
have
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
timidity
be
due
to
an
indistinct
consciousness
that
she
be
in
the
strange
situation
of
consult
a
third
person
about
the
adequacy
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
learning
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
exactly
the
same
material
,
"
say
Will
,
think
that
he
would
be
duly
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
an
orientalist
,
you
know

He
do
not

to
have
more
than
second
-
hand
knowledge
there

<EOS>
"

there
be
very
valuable
book
about
antiquity

be
write
a
long
while
ago
by
scholar

know
nothing
about
these
modern
thing
;
and
they
be
still
use

<EOS>
why
should
Mr.

not
be
valuable
,
like
theirs

say
Dorothea
,
with
more
remonstrant
energy
.
<EOS>
She
be
impel
to
have
the
argument
aloud
,
which
she
have
be
have

hearted

for
many

together

there
be
circumstance
connect
with
this
debt
which
make
the
thought
of
it
unusually
importunate

<EOS>
the
creditor
be
Mr.
Bambridge
<EOS>
a
horse
-
dealer
of
the
neighborhood

whose
company
be
much
seek

<EOS>
during
the
vacation
Fred
have
naturally
require
more
amusement
than
he
have
ready
money
for
,
and
Mr.
Bambridge
have
be
accommodate
enough
not
only
to
trust
him
for
the
hire
of
horse
and
the
accidental
expense
of
ruin
a
fine
hunter
,
but
also
to
make
a
small
advance
by
which
he
may
be
able
to
meet
some
loss
at
billiard
.
 
<EOS>
the
total
debt
be
a
hundred
and
sixty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Bambridge
be
in
no
alarm
about
his
money
,
be
sure
that
young
Vincy
have
backer
;
but
he
have
require
something
to
show
for
it

and
Fred
have
<EOS>
at
first
give
a
bill
with
his

three

later
he
have
renew

on

Fred
have
feel
confident
that
he
should
meet
the

himself

have
ample
fund
at
disposal
in
his
own
hopefulness

<EOS>
You
will
hardly
demand
that
his
confidence
should
have
a
basis
in
external
fact
;
such
confidence
,
we
know
,
be
something
less
coarse

materialistic

it
be
a
comfortable
disposition
lead
us
to
expect
that
the
wisdom

providence

the
folly
of
our
friend

the
mystery
of
luck
or
the
still
great
mystery
of
our
high
individual
value
in
the
universe
,
will
bring
about
agreeable
issue
,
such
as
be
consistent
with
our
good

our
general
preference

the
good

<EOS>
Fred
feel
sure
that
he
should
have
a
present
from
his
uncle

that
he
should
have
a
run

luck
,
that
by
dint

should
gradually
metamorphose
a
horse
worth
forty
pound
into
a
horse
that
would
fetch
a
hundred

any
moment
 
"
judgment
"
be
always
equivalent
to
an
unspecified
sum
in
hard
cash
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
any
case
,
even
suppose
negation
which
only
a
morbid
distrust
could
imagine

Fred
have
always
(
at

<EOS>
his

pocket
as
a

resource

so
that
his

gorgeous
superfluity

<EOS>
of
what
may
be
the
capacity

Fred

be
not

and
would
not
the
deficiency
of
one
year
be
make
up
for
by
the
surplus
of
another
?
 
<EOS>
the
Vincys
live
in
an
easy
profuse
way
,
not
with
any
new
ostentation
,
but
accord
to
the
family
habit
and
tradition
,
so
that
the
child
have
no
standard
of
economy
,
and
the
elder
one
retain
some
of
their
infantine
notion
that
their
father
may
pay
for
anything
if
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
himself
have
expensive
Middlemarch
habit
 
spend
money
on
course
,
on
his
cellar
,
and
on
dinner
-
giving
,
while
mamma
have
those
run
account
with
tradespeople
,
which
give
a
cheerful
sense
of
get
everything
one
want
without
any
question
of
payment
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
the
nature
of
father
,
Fred
know
,
to
bully
one
about
expense
:
there
be
always
a
little
storm
over
his
extravagance
if
he
have
to
disclose
a
debt
,
and
Fred
dislike
bad
weather
within
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
filial
to
be
disrespectful
to
his
father
,
and
he
bear
the
thunder
with
the
certainty
that
it
be
transient
;
but
in
the
mean
time
it
be
disagreeable
to
see
his
mother
cry
,
and
also
to
be
oblige
to
look
sulky
instead
of
have
fun
;
for
Fred
be
so
good
-
temper
that
if
he
look
glum
under
scold
,
it
be
chiefly
for
propriety
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
the
easy
course
plainly
,
be
to
renew
the
bill
with
a
friend
's
signature
.
<EOS>
why
not
?
<EOS>
with
the
superfluous
security
of
hope
at
his
command
,
there
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
have
increase
other
people
's
liability
to
any
extent
,
but
for
the
fact
that
man
whose
name
be
good
for
anything
be
usually
pessimist
,
indispose
to
believe
that
the
universal
order
of
thing
would
necessarily
be
agreeable
to
an
agreeable
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
favor
to
ask
we
review
our
list
of
friend
,
do
justice
to
their
more
amiable
quality
,
forgive
their
little
offense
,
and
concern
each
in
turn
,
try
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
he
will
be
eager
to
oblige
us
,
our
own
eagerness
to
be
oblige
be
as
communicable
as
other
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
still
there
be
always
a
certain
number
who
be
dismiss
as
but
moderately
eager
until
the
other
have
refuse
;
and
it
happen
that
Fred
check
off
all
his
friend
but
one
,
on
the
ground
that
apply
to
them
would
be
disagreeable
;
be
implicitly
convince
that
he
at
least
(
whatever
may
be
maintain
about
mankind
generally
)
have
a
right
to
be
free
from
anything
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
should
ever
fall
into
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
position
 
wear
trouser
shrink
with
washing
,
eat
cold
mutton
,
have
to
walk
for
want
of
a
horse
,
or
to
"
duck
under
"
in
any
sort
of
way
 
<EOS>
be
an
absurdity
irreconcilable
with
those
cheerful
intuition
implant
in
him
by
nature
.
 
<EOS>
and
Fred
wince
under
the
idea
of
be
look
down
upon
as
want
fund
for
small
debt
.
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
the
friend
whom
he
choose
to
apply
to
be
at
once
the
poor
and
the
kind
 
<EOS>
namely
,
Caleb
Garth
.
  
<EOS>
the
Garths
be
very
fond
of
Fred
,
as
he
be
of
them
;
for
when
he
and
Rosamond
be
little
one
,
and
the
Garths
be
well
off
,
the
slight
connection
between
the
two
family
through
Mr.
Featherstone
's
double
marriage
(
the
first
to
Mr.
Garth
's
sister
,
and
the
second
to
Mrs.
Vincy
's
)
have
lead
to
an
acquaintance
which
be
carry
on
between
the
child
rather
than
the
parent
:
the
child
drink
tea
together
out
of
their
toy
teacup
,
and
spend
whole
day
together
in
play
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
a
little
hoyden
,
and
Fred
at
six
year
old
think
her
the
nice
girl
in
the
world
,
make
her
his
wife
with
a
brass
ring
which
he
have
cut
from
an
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
through
all
the
stage
of
his
education
he
have
keep
his
affection
for
the
Garths
,
and
his
habit
of
go
to
their
house
as
a
second
home
,
though
any
intercourse
between
them
and
the
elder
of
his
family
have
long
cease
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
Caleb
Garth
be
prosperous
,
the
Vincys
be
on
condescend
term
with
him
and
his
wife
,
for
there
be
nice
distinction
of
rank
in
Middlemarch
;
and
though
old
manufacturer
could
not
any
more
than
duke
be
connect
with
none
but
equal
,
they
be
conscious
of
an
inherent
social
superiority
which
be
define
with
great
nicety
in
practice
,
though
hardly
expressible
theoretically
.
 
<EOS>
since
then
Mr.
Garth
have
fail
in
the
building
business
,
which
he
have
unfortunately
add
to
his
other
avocation
of
surveyor
,
valuer
,
and
agent
,
have
conduct
that
business
for
a
time
entirely
for
the
benefit
of
his
assignee
,
and
have
be
live
narrowly
,
exert
himself
to
the
utmost
that
he
may
after
all
pay
twenty
shilling
in
the
pound
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
now
achieve
this
,
and
from
all
who
do
not
think
it
a
bad
precedent
,
his
honorable
exertion
have
win
him
due
esteem
;
but
in
no
part
of
the
world
be
genteel
visit
found
on
esteem
,
in
the
absence
of
suitable
furniture
and
complete
dinner
-
service
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vincy
have
never
be
at
her
ease
with
Mrs.
Garth
,
and
frequently
speak
of
her
as
a
woman
who
have
have
to
work
for
her
bread
 
mean
that
Mrs.
Garth
have
be
a
teacher
before
her
marriage
;
in
which
case
an
intimacy
with
Lindley
Murray
and
Mangnall
's
Questions
be
something
like
a
draper
's
discrimination
of
calico
trademark
,
or
a
courier
's
acquaintance
with
foreign
country
:
no
woman
who
be
well
off
need
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
since
Mary
have
be
keep
Mr.
Featherstone
's
house
,
Mrs.
Vincy
's
want
of
like
for
the
Garths
have
be
convert
into
something
more
positive
,
by
alarm
l
Fred
should
engage
himself
to
this
plain
girl
,
whose
parent
"
live
in
such
a
small
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
Fred
,
be
aware
of
this
,
never
speak
at
home
of
his
visit
to
Mrs.
Garth
,
which
have
of
late
become
more
frequent
,
the
increase
ardor
of
his
affection
for
Mary
incline
him
the
more
towards
those
who
belong
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Garth
have
a
small
office
in
the
town
,
and
to
this
Fred
go
with
his
request
.
 
<EOS>
He
obtain
it
without
much
difficulty
,
for
a
large
amount
of
painful
experience
have
not
suffice
to
make
Caleb
Garth
cautious
about
his
own
affair
,
or
distrustful
of
his
fellow
-
man
when
they
have
not
prove
themselves
untrustworthy
;
and
he
have
the
high
opinion
of
Fred
,
be
"
sure
the
lad
would
turn
out
well
 
an
open
affectionate
fellow
,
with
a
good
bottom
to
his
character
 
you
may
trust
him
for
anything
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
Caleb
's
psychological
argument
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
rare
man
who
be
rigid
to
themselves
and
indulgent
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
certain
shame
about
his
neighbor
'
error
,
and
never
speak
of
them
willingly
;
hence
he
be
not
likely
to
divert
his
mind
from
the
good
mode
of
harden
timber
and
other
ingenious
device
in
order
to
preconceive
those
error
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
to
blame
any
one
,
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
move
all
the
paper
within
his
reach
,
or
describe
various
diagram
with
his
stick
,
or
make
calculation
with
the
odd
money
in
his
pocket
,
before
he
could
begin
;
and
he
would
rather
do
other
man
's
work
than
find
fault
with
their
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
he
be
a
bad
disciplinarian
.
  
<EOS>
when
Fred
state
the
circumstance
of
his
debt
,
his
wish
to
meet
it
without
trouble
his
father
,
and
the
certainty
that
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
so
as
to
cause
no
one
any
inconvenience
,
Caleb
push
his
spectacle
upward
,
listen
,
look
into
his
favorite
's
clear
young
eye
,
and
believe
him
,
not
distinguish
confidence
about
the
future
from
veracity
about
the
past
;
but
he
feel
that
it
be
an
occasion
for
a
friendly
hint
as
to
conduct
,
and
that
before
give
his
signature
he
must
give
a
rather
strong
admonition
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
take
the
paper
and
lower
his
spectacle
,
measure
the
space
at
his
command
,
reach
his
pen
and
examine
it
,
dip
it
in
the
ink
and
examine
it
again
,
then
push
the
paper
a
little
way
from
him
,
lift
up
his
spectacle
again
,
show
a
deepened
depression
in
the
outer
angle
of
his
bushy
eyebrow
,
which
give
his
face
a
peculiar
mildness
(
pardon
these
detail
for
once
 
<EOS>
you
would
have
learn
to
love
them
if
you
have
know
Caleb
Garth
)
,
and
say
in
a
comfortable
tone
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
misfortune
,
eh
,
<EOS>
that
break
the
horse
's
knee
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
these
exchange
,
they
do
not
answer
when
you
have
'
cute
jockey
to
deal
with
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
wise
another
time
,
my
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
Caleb
draw
down
his
spectacle
,
and
proceed
to
write
his
signature
with
the
care
which
he
always
give
to
that
performance
;
for
whatever
he
do
in
the
way
of
business
he
do
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
contemplate
the
large
well
-
proportion
letter
and
final
flourish
,
with
his
head
a
trifle
on
one
side
for
an
instant
,
then
hand
it
to
Fred
,
say
"
good
-
by
,
"
and
return
forthwith
to
his
absorption
in
a
plan
for
Sir
James
Chettam
's
new
farm
-
building
.
  
<EOS>
either
because
his
interest
in
this
work
thrust
the
incident
of
the
signature
from
his
memory
,
or
for
some
reason
of
which
Caleb
be
more
conscious
,
Mrs.
Garth
remain
ignorant
of
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
since
it
occur
,
a
change
have
come
over
Fred
's
sky
,
which
alter
his
view
of
the
distance
,
and
be
the
reason
why
his
uncle
Featherstone
's
present
of
money
be
of
importance
enough
to
make
his
color
come
and
go
,
first
with
a
too
definite
expectation
,
and
afterwards
with
a
proportionate
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
His
failure
in
pass
his
examination
,
have
make
his
accumulation
of
college
debt
the
more
unpardonable
by
his
father
,
and
there
have
be
an
unprecedented
storm
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
have
swear
that
if
he
have
anything
more
of
that
sort
to
put
up
with
,
Fred
should
turn
out
and
get
his
living
how
he
could
;
and
he
have
never
yet
quite
recover
his
good
-
humored
tone
to
his
son
,
who
have
especially
enrage
him
by
say
at
this
stage
of
thing
that
he
do
not
want
to
be
a
clergyman
,
and
would
rather
not
"
go
on
with
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fred
be
conscious
that
he
would
have
be
yet
more
severely
deal
with
if
his
family
as
well
as
himself
have
not
secretly
regard
him
as
Mr.
Featherstone
's
heir
;
that
old
gentleman
's
pride
in
him
,
and
apparent
fondness
for
him
,
serve
in
the
stead
of
more
exemplary
conduct
 
just
as
when
a
youthful
nobleman
steal
jewellery
<EOS>
we
call
the
act
kleptomania
,
speak
of
it
with
a
philosophical
smile
,
and
never
think
of
his
be
send
to
the
house
of
correction
as
if
he
be
a
ragged
boy
who
have
steal
turnip
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
tacit
expectation
of
what
would
be
do
for
him
by
uncle
Featherstone
determine
the
angle
at
which
most
people
view
Fred
Vincy
in
Middlemarch
;
and
in
his
own
consciousness
,
what
uncle
Featherstone
would
do
for
him
in
an
emergency
,
or
what
he
would
do
simply
as
an
incorporated
luck
,
form
always
an
immeasurable
depth
of
aerial
perspective
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
present
of
bank
-
note
,
once
make
,
be
measurable
,
and
be
apply
to
the
amount
of
the
debt
,
show
a
deficit
which
have
still
to
be
fill
up
either
by
Fred
's
"
judgment
"
or
by
luck
in
some
other
shape
.
 
<EOS>
for
that
little
episode
of
the
allege
borrowing
,
in
which
he
have
make
his
father
the
agent
in
get
the
Bulstrode
certificate
,
be
a
new
reason
against
go
to
his
father
for
money
towards
meet
his
actual
debt
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
be
keen
enough
to
foresee
that
anger
would
confuse
distinction
,
and
that
his
denial
of
have
borrow
expressly
on
the
strength
of
his
uncle
's
will
would
be
take
as
a
falsehood
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
go
to
his
father
and
tell
him
one
vexatious
affair
,
and
he
have
leave
another
untold
:
<EOS>
in
such
case
the
complete
revelation
always
produce
the
impression
of
a
previous
duplicity
.
 
<EOS>
now
Fred
pique
himself
on
keep
clear
of
lie
,
and
even
fibs
;
he
often
shrug
his
shoulder
and
make
a
significant
grimace
at
what
he
call
Rosamond
's
fibs
<EOS>
(
it
be
only
brother
who
can
associate
such
idea
with
a
lovely
girl
)
;
and
rather
than
incur
the
accusation
of
falsehood
he
would
even
incur
some
trouble
and
self
-
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
under
strong
inward
pressure
of
this
kind
that
Fred
have
take
the
wise
step
of
deposit
the
eighty
pound
with
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
he
have
not
at
once
give
them
to
Mr.
Garth
;
but
he
mean
to
make
the
sum
complete
with
another
sixty
,
and
with
a
view
to
this
,
he
have
keep
twenty
pound
in
his
own
pocket
as
a
sort
of
seed
-
corn
,
which
,
plant
by
judgment
,
and
water
by
luck
,
may
yield
more
than
threefold
 
a
very
poor
rate
of
multiplication
when
the
field
be
a
young
gentleman
's
infinite
soul
,
with
all
the
numeral
at
command
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
be
not
a
gambler
:
he
have
not
that
specific
disease
in
which
the
suspension
of
the
whole
nervous
energy
on
a
chance
or
risk
become
as
necessary
as
the
dram
to
the
drunkard
;
he
have
only
the
tendency
to
that
diffusive
form
of
gambling
which
have
no
alcoholic
intensity
,
but
be
carry
on
with
the
healthy
chyle
-
feed
blood
,
keep
up
a
joyous
imaginative
activity
which
fashion
event
accord
to
desire
,
and
have
no
fear
about
its
own
weather
,
only
see
the
advantage
there
must
be
to
other
in
go
aboard
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Hopefulness
have
a
pleasure
in
make
a
throw
of
any
kind
,
because
the
prospect
of
success
be
certain
;
and
only
a
more
generous
pleasure
in
offer
as
many
as
possible
a
share
in
the
stake
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
like
play
,
especially
billiard
,
as
he
like
hunt
or
ride
a
steeple
-
chase
;
and
he
only
like
it
the
well
because
he
want
money
and
hope
to
win

<EOS>
but
the
twenty
pound
'
worth
of
seed
-
corn
have
be
plant
in
vain
in
the
seductive
green
plot
 
all
of
it
at
least
which
have
not
be
disperse
by
the
roadside
 
and
Fred
find
himself
close
upon
the
term
of
payment
with
no
money
at
command
beyond
the
eighty
pound
which
he
have
deposit
with
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
the
break

winded
horse
which
he
ride
represent
a
present
which
have
be
make
to
him
a
long
while
ago
by
his
uncle
Featherstone
<EOS>
:
his
father
always
allow
him
to
keep
a
horse
,
Mr.
Vincy
's
own
habit
make
him
regard
this
as
a
reasonable
demand
even
for
a
son
who
be
rather
exasperating
.
 
<EOS>
this
horse
,
then
,
be
Fred
's
property
,
and
in
his
anxiety
to
meet
the
imminent
bill
he
determine
to
sacrifice
a
possession
without
which
life
would
certainly
be
worth
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
the
resolution
with
a
sense
of
heroism
 
heroism
force
on
him
by
the
dread
of
break
his
word
to
Mr.
Garth
,
by
his
love
for
Mary
and
awe
of
her
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
start
for
Houndsley
horse
-
fair
which
be
to
be
hold
the
next
morning
,
and
 
simply
sell
his
horse
,
bring
back
the
money
by
coach
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
the
horse
would
hardly
fetch
more
than
thirty
pound
,
and
there
be
no
know
what
may
happen
;
it
would
be
folly
to
balk
himself
of
luck
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
hundred
to
one
that
some
good
chance
would
fall
in
his
way
;
the
longer
he
think
of
it
,
the
less
possible
it
seem
that
he
should
not
have
a
good
chance
,
and
the
less
reasonable
that
he
should
not
equip
himself
with
the
powder
and
shoot
for
bring
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ride
to
Houndsley
with
Bambridge
and
with
Horrock
"
the
vet
,
"
and
without
ask
them
anything
expressly
,
he
should
virtually
get
the
benefit
of
their
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
set
out
,
Fred
get
the
eighty
pound
from
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
see
Fred
ride
out
of
Middlemarch
in
company
with
Bambridge
and
Horrock
,
on
his
way
of
course
to
Houndsley
horse
-
fair
,
think
that
young
Vincy
be
pleasure
-
seek
as
usual
;
and
but
for
an
unwonted
consciousness
of
grave
matter
on
hand
,
he
himself
would
have
have
a
sense
of
dissipation
,
and
of
do
what
may
be
expect
of
a
gay
young
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
consider
that
Fred
be
not
at
all
coarse
,
that
he
rather
look
down
on
the
manner
and
speech
of
young
man
who
have
not
be
to
the
university
,
and
that
he
have
write
stanza
as
pastoral
and
unvoluptuous
as
his
flute
-
playing
,
his
attraction
towards
Bambridge
and
Horrock
be
an
interesting
fact
which
even
the
love
of
horse
-
flesh
would
not
wholly
account
for
without
that
mysterious
influence
of
naming
which
determinate
so
much
of
mortal
choice
.
 
<EOS>
under
any
other
name
than
"
pleasure
"
the
society
of
Messieurs
Bambridge
and
Horrock
must
certainly
have
be
regard
as
monotonous
;
and
to
arrive
with
them
at
Houndsley
on
a
drizzling
afternoon
,
to
get
down
at
the
Red
Lion
in
a
street
shade
with
coal
-
dust
,
and
dine
in
a
room
furnish
with
a
dirt
-
enamel
map
of
the
county
,
a
bad
portrait
of
an
anonymous
horse
in
a
stable
,
His
Majesty
George
the
Fourth
with
leg
and
cravat
,
and
various
leaden
spittoon
,
may
have
seem
a
hard
business
,
but
for
the
sustain
power
of
nomenclature
which
determine
that
the
pursuit
of
these
thing
be
"
gay
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
Mr.
Horrock
there
be
certainly
an
apparent
unfathomableness
which
offer
play
to
the
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
Costume
,
at
a
glance
,
give
him
a
thrilling
association
with
horse
(
enough
to
specify
the
hat
-
brim
which
take
the
slight
upward
angle
just
to
escape
the
suspicion
of
bend
downwards
)
,
and
nature
have
give
him
a
face
which
by
dint
of
mongolian
eye
,
and
a
nose
,
mouth
,
and
chin
seem
to
follow
his
hat
-
brim
in
a
moderate
inclination
upwards
,
give
the
effect
of
a
subdued
unchangeable
sceptical
smile
,
of
all
expression
the
most
tyrannous
over
a
susceptible
mind
,
and
,
when
accompany
by
adequate
silence
,
likely
to
create
the
reputation
of
an
invincible
understanding
,
an
infinite
fund
of
humor
 
too
dry
to
flow
,
and
probably
in
a
state
of
immovable
crust
,
 
and
a
critical
judgment
which
,
if
you
could
ever
be
fortunate
enough
to
know
it
,
would
be
_
the
_
thing
and
no
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
physiognomy
see
in
all
vocation
,
but
perhaps
it
have
never
be
more
powerful
over
the
youth
of
England
than
in
a
judge
of
horse
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Horrock
,
at
a
question
from
Fred
about
his
horse
's
fetlock
,
turn
sideways
in
his
saddle
,
and
watch
the
horse
's
action
for
the
space
of
three
minute
,
then
turn
forward
,
twitch
his
own
bridle
,
and
remain
silent
with
a
profile
neither
more
nor
less
sceptical
than
it
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
part
thus
play
in
dialogue
by
Mr.
Horrock
be
terribly
effective
.
<EOS>
a
mixture
of
passion
be
excite
in
Fred
 
a
mad
desire
to
thrash
Horrock
's
opinion
into
utterance
,
restrain
by
anxiety
to
retain
the
advantage
of
his
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
the
chance
that
Horrock
may
say
something
quite
invaluable
at
the
right
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bambridge
have
more
open
manner
,
and
appear
to
give
forth
his
idea
without
economy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
loud
,
robust
,
and
be
sometimes
speak
of
as
be
"
give
to
indulgence
"
 
chiefly
in
swearing
,
drinking
,
and
beat
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
who
have
lose
by
him
call
him
a
vicious
man
;
but
he
regard
horse
-
deal
as
the
fine
of
the
art
,
and
may
have
argue
plausibly
that
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
morality
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
undeniably
a
prosperous
man
,
bore
his
drinking
better
than
other
bear
their
moderation
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
flourish
like
the
green
bay
-
tree
.
<EOS>
but
his
range
of
conversation
be
limit
,
and
like
the
fine
old
tune
,
"
drop
of
brandy
,
"
give
you
after
a
while
a
sense
of
return
upon
itself
in
a
way
that
may
make
weak
head
dizzy
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
slight
infusion
of
Mr.
Bambridge
be
feel
to
give
tone
and
character
to
several
circle
in
Middlemarch
;
and
he
be
a
distinguished
figure
in
the
bar
and
billiard
-
room
at
the
Green
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
some
anecdote
about
the
hero
of
the
turf
,
and
various
clever
trick
of
Marquesses
and
Viscounts
which
seem
to
prove
that
blood
assert
its
pre
-
eminence
even
among
black
-
leg
;
but
the
minute
retentiveness
of
his
memory
be
chiefly
show
about
the
horse
he
have
himself
buy
and
sell
;
the
number
of
mile
they
would
trot
you
in
no
time
without
turn
a
hair
be
,
after
the
lapse
of
year
,
still
a
subject
of
passionate
asseveration
,
in
which
he
would
assist
the
imagination
of
his
hearer
by
solemnly
swear
that
they
never
see
anything
like
it
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mr.
Bambridge
be
a
man
of
pleasure
and
a
gay
companion
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
be
subtle
,
and
do
not
tell
his
friend
that
he
be
go
to
Houndsley
bent
on
sell
his
horse
:
he
wish
to
get
indirectly
at
their
genuine
opinion
of
its
value
,
not
be
aware
that
a
genuine
opinion
be
the
last
thing
likely
to
be
extract
from
such
eminent
critic
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
Mr.
Bambridge
's
weakness
to
be
a
gratuitous
flatterer
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
before
be
so
much
strike
with
the
fact
that
this
unfortunate
bay
be
a
roarer
to
a
degree
which
require
the
round
word
for
perdition
to
give
you
any
idea
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
a
bad
hand
at
swap
when
you
go
to
anybody
but
me

Vincy

<EOS>
why
,
you
never
throw
your
leg
across
a
fine
horse
than
that
chestnut
,
and
you
give
him
for
this
brute

<EOS>
if
you
set
him
canter

he
go
on
like
twenty

<EOS>
I
never
hear

one
bad
roarer
in
my

that
be
a

<EOS>
it
belong
to
Pegwell

he
use
to
drive
him
in
his
gig
seven

I

round
of

that
joke
do

<EOS>
but
,
what
the
hell
!
<EOS>
the
horse
be
a
penny
trumpet
to
that
roarer
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
say
just
now
his
be
bad
than
mine
,
"
say
Fred
,
more
irritable
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
a
lie
,
then
,
"
say
Mr.
Bambridge
,
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
a

"
  
<EOS>
Fred
spur
his
horse
,
and
they
trot
on
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
slacken
again
,
Mr.
Bambridge
say
    
"
not
but
what
the
roan
be
a
well
trotter
than
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
satisfied
with
his
pace
,
I
know
,
"
say
Fred
,
who
require
all
the
consciousness
of
be
in
gay
company
to
support
him
;
"
I
say
his
trot
be
an
uncommonly
clean
one
,
eh
,
Horrock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Horrock
look
before
him
with
as
complete
a
neutrality
as
if
he
have
be
a
portrait
by
a
great
master
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
give
up
the
fallacious
hope
of
get
a
genuine
opinion
;
but
on
reflection
he
see
that
Bambridge
's
depreciation
and
Horrock
's
silence
be
both
virtually
encouraging
,
and
indicate
that
they
think
better
of
the
horse
than
they
choose
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
that
very
evening
,
indeed
,
before
the
fair
have
set
in
,
Fred
think
he
see
a
favorable
opening
for
dispose
advantageously
of
his
horse
,
but
an
opening
which
make
him
congratulate
himself
on
his
foresight
in
bring
with
him
his
eighty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
a
young
farmer
,
acquaint
with
Mr.
Bambridge
,
come
into
the
Red
Lion
,
and
enter
into
conversation
about
part
with
a
hunter
,
which
he
introduce
at
once
as
Diamond
,
imply
that
it
be
a
public
character
.
 
<EOS>
for
himself
he
only
want
a
useful
hack
,
which
would
draw
upon
occasion
;
be
about
to
marry
and
to
give
up
hunting
.
 
<EOS>
the
hunter
be
in
a
friend
's
stable
at
some
little
distance
;
there
be
still
time
for
gentleman
to
see
it
before
dark
.
<EOS>
the
friend
's
stable
have
to
be
reach
through
a
back
street
where
you
may
as
easily
have
be
poison
without
expense
of
drug
as
in
any
grim
street
of
that
unsanitary
period
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
be
not
fortify
against
disgust
by
brandy
,
as
his
companion
be
,
but
the
hope
of
have
at
last
see
the
horse
that
would
enable
him
to
make
money
be
exhilarate
enough
to
lead
him
over
the
same
ground
again
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
that
if
he
do
not
come
to
a
bargain
with
the
farmer
,
Bambridge
would
;
for
the
stress
of
circumstance
,
Fred
feel
,
be
sharpen
his
acuteness
and
endow
him
with
all
the
constructive
power
of
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Bambridge
have
run
down
Diamond
in
a
way
that
he
never
would
have
do
(
the
horse
be
a
friend
's
)
if
he
have
not
think
of
buy
it
;
every
one
who
look
at
the
animal
 
even
<EOS>
Horrock
 
be
evidently
impress
with
its
merit
.
 
<EOS>
to
get
all
the
advantage
of
be
with
man
of
this
sort
,
you
must
know
how
to
draw
your
inference
,
and
not
be
a
spoon
who
take
thing
literally
.
<EOS>
the
color
of
the
horse
be
a
dapple
gray
,
and
Fred
happen
to
know
that
Lord
Medlicote
's
man
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
just
such
a
horse
.
<EOS>
after
all
his
run
down
,
Bambridge
let
it
out
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
when
the
farmer
be
absent
,
that
he
have
see
bad
horse
go
for
eighty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
contradict
himself
twenty
time
over
,
but
when
you
know
what
be
likely
to
be
true
you
can
test
a
man
's
admission
.
 
<EOS>
and
Fred
could
not
but
reckon
his
own
judgment
of
a
horse
as
worth
something
.
 
<EOS>
the
farmer
have
pause
over
Fred
's
respectable
though
break
-
winded
steed
long
enough
to
show
that
he
think
it
worth
consideration
,
and
it
seem
probable
that
he
would
take
it
,
with
five
-
and
-
twenty
pound
in
addition
,
as
the
equivalent
of
Diamond
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
case
Fred
,
when
he
have
part
with
his
new
horse
for
at
least
eighty
pound
,
would
be
fifty
-
five
pound
in
pocket
by
the
transaction
,
and
would
have
a
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
pound
towards
meet
the
bill
;
so
that
the
deficit
temporarily
throw
on
Mr.
Garth
would
at
the
utmost
be
twenty
-
five
pound
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
be
hurry
on
his
clothe
in
the
morning
,
he
see
so
clearly
the
importance
of
not
lose
this
rare
chance
,
that
if
Bambridge
and
Horrock
have
both
dissuade
him
,
he
would
not
have
be
delude
into
a
direct
interpretation
of
their
purpose
:
he
would
have
be
aware
that
those
deep
hand
hold
something
else
than
a
young
fellow
's
interest
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
horse
,
distrust
be
your
only
clew
.
 
<EOS>
but
scepticism
,
as
we
know
,
can
never
be
thoroughly
apply
,
else
life
would
come
to
a
standstill
:
something
we
must
believe
in
and
do
,
and
whatever
that
something
may
be
call
,
it
be
virtually
our
own
judgment
,
even
when
it
seem
like
the
most
slavish
reliance
on
another
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
believe
in
the
excellence
of
his
bargain
,
and
even
before
the
fair
have
well
set
in
,
have
get
possession
of
the
dapple
gray
,
at
the
price
of
his
old
horse
and
thirty
pound
in
addition
 
only
five
pound
more
than
he
have
expect
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
feel
a
little
worried
and
weary
,
perhaps
with
mental
debate
,
and
without
wait
for
the
further
gayetie
of
the
horse
-

SHAKESPEARE
:
sonnet
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
only
the
third
day
after
the
propitious
event
at
Houndsley
Fred
Vincy
have
fall
into
bad
spirit
than
he
have
know
in
his
life
before
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
he
have
be
disappoint
as
to
the
possible
market
for
his
horse
,
but
that
before
the
bargain
could
be
conclude
with
Lord
Medlicote
's
man
,
this
Diamond
,
in
which
hope
to
the
amount
of
eighty
pound
have
be
invest
,
have
without
the
slight
warning
exhibit
in
the
stable
a
most
vicious
energy
in
kicking
,
have
just
miss
kill
the
groom
,
and
have
end
in
lame
himself
severely
by
catch
his
leg
in
a
rope
that
overhang
the
stable
-
board
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
redress
for
this
than
for
the
discovery
of
bad
temper
after
marriage
 
which
of
course
old
companion
be
aware
of
before
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
reason
or
other
,
Fred
have
none
of
his
usual
elasticity
under
this
stroke
of
ill
-
fortune
:
he
be
simply
aware
that
he
have
only
fifty
pound
,
that
there
be
no
chance
of
his
get
any
more
at
present
,
and
that
the
bill
for
a
hundred
and
sixty
would
be
present
in
five
day
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
he
have
apply
to
his
father
on
the
plea
that
Mr.
Garth
should
be
save
from
loss
,
Fred
feel
smartingly
that
his
father
would
angrily
refuse
to
rescue
Mr.
Garth
from
the
consequence
of
what
he
would
call
encourage
extravagance
and
deceit
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
utterly
downcast
that
he
could
frame
no
other
project
than
to
go
straight
to
Mr.
Garth
and
tell
him
the
sad
truth
,
carry
with
him
the
fifty
pound
,
and
get
that
sum
at
least
safely
out
of
his
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
,
be
at
the
warehouse
,
do
not
yet
know
of
the
accident
:
when
he
do
,
he
would
storm
about
the
vicious
brute
being
bring
into
his
stable
;
and
before
meet
that
less
annoyance
Fred
want
to
get
away
with
all
his
courage
to
face
the
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
his
father
's
nag
,
for
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
when
he
have
tell
Mr.
Garth
,
he
would
ride
to
Stone
Court
and
confess
all
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
probable
that
<EOS>
but
for
Mary
's
existence
and
Fred
's
love
for
her
,
his
conscience
would
have
be
much
less
active
both
in
previously
urge
the
debt
on
his
thought
and
impel
him
not
to
spare
himself
after
his
usual
fashion
by
defer
an
unpleasant
task
,
but
to
act
as
directly
and
simply
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
even
much
strong
mortal
than
Fred
Vincy
hold
half
their
rectitude
in
the
mind
of
the
being
they
love
best
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
theatre
of
all
my
action
be
fall
,
"
say
an
antique
personage
when
his
chief
friend
be
dead
;
and
they
be
fortunate
who
get
a
theatre
where
the
audience
demand
their
good
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
it
would
have
make
a
considerable
difference
to
Fred
at
that
time
if
Mary
Garth
have
have
no
decide
notion
as
to
what
be
admirable
in
character
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Garth
be
not
at
the
office
,
and
Fred
ride
on
to
his
house
,
which
be
a
little
way
outside
the
town
 
a
homely
place
with
an
orchard
in
front
of
it
,
a
rambling
,
old
-
fashioned
,
half
-
timbere
building
,
which
before
the
town
have
spread
have
be
a
farm
-
house
,
but
be
now
surround
with
the
private
garden
of
the
townsman
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
the
fonder
of
our
house
if
they
have
a
physiognomy
of
their
own
,
as
our
friend
have
.
 
<EOS>
the
Garth
family
,
which
be
rather
a
large
one
,
for
Mary
have
four
brother
and
one
sister
,
be
very
fond
of
their
old
house
,
from
which
all
the
good
furniture
have
long
be
sell
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
like
it
too
,
know
it
by
heart
even
to
the
attic
which
smell
deliciously
of
apple
and
quince
,
and
until
to
-
day
he
have
never
come
to
it
without
pleasant
expectation
;
but
his
heart
beat
uneasily
now
with
the
sense
that
he
should
probably
have
to
make
his
confession
before
Mrs.
Garth
,
of
whom
he
be
rather
more
in
awe
than
of
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
she
be
incline
to
sarcasm
and
to
impulsive
sally
,
as
Mary
be
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
present
matronly
age
at
least
,
Mrs.
Garth
never
commit
herself
by
over
-
hasty
speech
;
have
,
as
she
say
,
borne
the
yoke
in
her
youth
,
and
learn
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
have
that
rare
sense
which
discern
what
be
unalterable
,
and
submit
to
it
without
murmur
.
 
<EOS>
adore
her
husband
's
virtue
,
she
have
very
early
make
up
her
mind
to
his
incapacity
of
mind
his
own
interest
,
and
have
meet
the
consequence
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
magnanimous
enough
to
renounce
all
pride
in
teapot
or
child
's
frilling
,
and
have
never
pour
any
pathetic
confidence
into
the
ear
of
her
feminine
neighbor
concern
Mr.
Garth
's
want
of
prudence
and
the
sum
he
may
have
have
if
he
have
be
like
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
hence
these
fair
neighbor
think
her
either
proud
or
eccentric
,
and
sometimes
speak
of
her
to
their
husband
as
"
your
fine
Mrs.
Garth
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
without
her
criticism
of
them
in
return
,
be
more
accurately
instruct
than
most
matron
in
Middlemarch
,
and
 
where
be
the
blameless
woman
?
 
<EOS>
apt
to
be
a
little
severe
towards
her
own
sex
,
which
in
her
opinion
be
frame
to
be
entirely
subordinate
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
she
be
disproportionately
indulgent
towards
the
failing
of
man
,
and
be
often
hear
to
say
that
these
be
natural
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
it
must
be
admit
that
Mrs.
Garth
be
a
trifle
too
emphatic
in
her
resistance
to
what
she
hold
to
be
folly
:
the
passage
from
governess
into
housewife
have
work
itself
a
little
too
strongly
into
her
consciousness
,
and
she
rarely
forget
that
while
her
grammar
and
accent
be
above
the
town
standard
,
she
wear
a
plain
cap
,
cook
the
family
dinner
,
and
darn
all
the
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
sometimes
take
pupil
in
a
peripatetic
fashion
,
make
them
follow
her
about
in
the
kitchen
with
their
book
or
slate
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
it
good
for
them
to
see
that
she
could
make
an
excellent
lather
while
she
correct
their
blunder
"
without
look
,
"
 
that
a
woman
with
her
sleeve
tuck
up
above
her
elbow
may
know
all
about
the
Subjunctive
Mood
or
the
Torrid
Zone
 
<EOS>
that
,
in
short
,
she
may
possess
"
education
"
and
other
good
thing
end
in
"
tion
,
"
and
worthy
to
be
pronounce
emphatically
,
without
be
a
useless
doll
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
make
remark
to
this
edifying
effect
,
she
have
a
firm
little
frown
on
her
brow
,
which
yet
do
not
hinder
her
face
from
look
benevolent
,
and
her
word
which
come
forth
like
a
procession
be
utter
in
a
fervid
agreeable
contralto
.
<EOS>
certainly
,
the
exemplary
Mrs.
Garth
have
her
droll
aspect
,
but
her
character
sustain
her
oddity
,
as
a
very
fine
wine
sustain
a
flavor
of
skin
.
  
<EOS>
towards
Fred
Vincy
she
have
a
motherly
feeling
,
and
have
always
be
dispose
to
excuse
his
error
,
though
she
would
probably
not
have
excuse
Mary
for
engage
herself
to
him
,
her
daughter
be
include
in
that
more
rigorous
judgment
which
she
apply
to
her
own
sex
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
very
fact
of
her
exceptional
indulgence
towards
him
make
it
the
hard
to
Fred
that
he
must
now
inevitably
sink
in
her
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
circumstance
of
his
visit
turn
out
to
be
still
more
unpleasant
than
he
have
expect
;
for
Caleb
Garth
have
go
out
early
to
look
at
some
repair
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.

at
certain

She

curly

more
delicacy

<EOS>
look
at
the
mother

you
may
hope
that
the
daughter
would
become
like

which
be
a
prospective

equal

Mrs.

astonish

look
at

explanation

there

I
know
it
will
be

Mrs.

gravely

decisively
,
though
a
nice
ear
may
have
discern
a
slight
tremor
in
some
of
the
word

I
have
no

that

will
advance

<EOS>
Mrs.
Garth
have
not
again
look
at
Fred

and
be
not
in
the
least
calculate
what
word
she
should
use
to
cut
him
the
most
effectively
.
<EOS>
like
the
eccentric
woman
<EOS>
she
be
,
she
be
at
present
absorb
in
consider
what
be
to
be
do
,
and
do
not
fancy
that
the
end
could
be
better
achieve
by
bitter
remark
or
explosion

<EOS>
but
she
have
make
Fred
feel
for
the
first
time
<EOS>
something
like
the
tooth
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
curiously
enough
,
his
pain
in
the
affair
beforehand
have
consist
almost
entirely
in
the
sense
that
he
must
seem
dishonorable
,
and
sink
in
the
opinion
of
the
Garths
:
he
have
not
occupy
himself
with
the
inconvenience
and
possible
injury
that
his
breach
may
occasion
them
,
for
this
exercise
of
the
imagination
on
other
people
's
need
be
not
common
with
hopeful
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
we
be
most
of
us
bring
up
in
the
notion
that
the
high
motive
for
not
do
a
wrong
be
something
irrespective
of
the
being
who
would
suffer
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
this
moment
he
suddenly
see
himself
as
a
pitiful
rascal
who
be
rob
two
woman
of
their
saving

I
shall
certainly
pay
it
all

stammer
out

<EOS>
"
yes

ultimately

Mrs.
Garth
,
who
have
a
special
dislike
to
fine
word
on
ugly
occasion

could
not
now
repress
an
epigram

not
well

She
have
never

make
excuse

up
his
chair
to
the
desk
,
and
say
,
"
deuce
take
the
bill
 
I
wish
it
be
at
Hanover
!
 
<EOS>
these
thing
be
a
sad
interruption
to
business
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
first
part
of
this
speech
comprise
his
whole
store
of
maledictory
expression
,
and
be
utter
with
a
slight
snarl
easy
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
convey
to
those
who
never
hear
him
utter
the
word
"
business
,
"
the
peculiar
tone
of
fervid
veneration
,
of
religious
regard
,
in
which
he
wrap
it
,
as
a
consecrated
symbol
be
wrap
in
its
gold
-
fringed
linen
.
  
<EOS>
Caleb
Garth
often
shake
his
head
in
meditation
on
the
value
,
the
indispensable
might
of
that
myriad
-
head
,
myriad
-
handed
labor
by
which
the
social
body
be
feed
,
clothe
,
and
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
lay
hold
of
his
imagination
in
boyhood
.
 
<EOS>
the
echo
of
the
great
hammer
where
roof
or
keel
be
a
-
making
,
the
signal
-
shout
of
the
workman
,
the
roar
of
the
furnace
,
the
thunder
and
plash
of
the
engine
,
be
a
sublime
music
to
him
;
the
felling
and
lading
of
timber
,
and
the
huge
trunk
vibrate
star
-
like
in
the
distance
along
the
highway
,
the
crane
at
work
on
the
wharf
,
the
pile
-
up
produce
in
warehouse
,
the
precision
and
variety
of
muscular
effort
wherever
exact
work
have
to
be
turn
out
,
 
all
these
sight
of
his
youth
have
act
on
him
as
poetry
without
the
aid
of
the
poet
,
have
make
a
philosophy
for
him
without
the
aid
of
philosopher
,
a
religion
without
the
aid
of
theology
.
 
<EOS>
His
early
ambition
have
be
to
have
as
effective
a
share
as
possible
in
this
sublime
labor
,
which
be
peculiarly
dignified
by
him
with
the
name
of
"
business
;
"
and
though
he
have
only
be
a
short
time
under
a
surveyor
,
and
have
be
chiefly
his
own
teacher
,
he
know
more
of
land
,
building
,
and
mining
than
most
of
the
special
man
in
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
His
classification
of
human
employment
be
rather
crude
,
and
,
like
the
category
of
more
celebrated
man
,
would
not
be
acceptable
in
these
advanced
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
divide
them
into
"
business
,
politic
,
preach
,
learning
,
and
amusement
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
last
four
;
but
he
regard
them
as
a
reverential
pagan
regard
other
god
than
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
,
he
think
very
well
of
all
rank
,
but
he
would
not
himself
have
like
to
be
of
any
rank
in
which
he
have
not
such
close
contact
with
"
business
"
as
to
get
often
honorably
decorate
with
mark
of
dust
and
mortar
,
the
damp
of
the
engine
,
or
the
sweet
soil
of
the
wood
and
field
.
 
<EOS>
though
he
have
never
regard
himself
as
other
than
an
orthodox
Christian
,
and
would
argue
on
prevenient
grace
if
the
subject
be
propose
to
him
,
I
think
his
virtual
divinity
be
good
practical
scheme
,
accurate
work
,
and
the
faithful
completion
of
undertaking
:
his
prince
of
darkness
be
a
slack
workman
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
spirit
of
denial
in
Caleb
,
and
the
world
seem
so
wondrous
to
him
that
he
be
ready
to
accept
any
number
of
system
,
like
any
number
of
firmament
,
if
they
do
not
obviously
interfere
with
the
good
land
-
drainage
,
solid
building
,
correct
measuring
,
and
judicious
boring
(
for
coal
)
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
have
a
reverential
soul
with
a
strong
practical
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
manage
finance
:
he
know
value
well
,
but
he
have
no
keenness
of
imagination
for
monetary
result
in
the
shape
of
profit
and
loss
:
and
have
ascertain
this
to
his
cost
,
he
determine
to
give
up
all
form
of
his
beloved
"
business
"
which
require
that
talent
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
himself
up
entirely
to
the
many
kind
of
work
which
he
could
do
without
handle
capital
,
and
be
one
of
those
precious
man
within
his
own
district
whom
everybody
would
choose
to
work
for
them
,
because
he
do
his
work
well
,
charge
very
little
,
and
often
decline
to
charge
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
,
then
,
that
the
Garths
be
poor
,
and
"
live
in
a
small
way

they

be
anything
you
like

if
you
will
say
that
you
love
me

I
should
be
ashamed
to
say
that
I
love
a
man
who
must
always
be
hang
on

reckon
on
what
they
would
do
for

<EOS>
what
will
you
be
when
you
be
forty
?
 
<EOS>
like
Mr.
Bowyer
<EOS>

I
suppose
 
just
as
idle

in

Beck

parlor
 
fat

hope
somebody
will
invite
you
to
dinner

your
morning

oh
no

learn
a

on

"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
lip
have
begin
to
curl
with
a
smile
as
soon
as
she
have
ask
that
question
about
Fred
's
future
(
young
soul
be
mobile
)
,
and
before
she
end
,
her
face
have
its
full
illumination
of
fun
.
 
<EOS>
to
him
it
be
like
the
cessation
of
an
ache
that
Mary
could
laugh
at
him
,
and
with
a
passive
sort
of
smile
he
try
to
reach
her
hand
;
but
she
slip
away
quickly
towards
the
door
and
say
,
"
I
shall
tell
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
You
_
<EOS>
must
_
see
him
for
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
secretly
feel
that
his
future
be
guarantee
against
the
fulfilment
of
Mary
's
sarcastic
prophecy
,
apart
from
that
"
anything
"
which
he
be
ready
to
do
if
she
would
define
it
.
<EOS>
He
never
dare
in
Mary
's
presence
to
approach
the
subject
of
his
expectation
from
Mr.
Featherstone
,
and
she
always
ignore
them
,
as
if
everything
depend
on
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
ever
he
actually
come
into
the
property
,
she
must
recognize
the
change
in
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
pass
through
his
mind
somewhat
languidly
,
before
he
go
up
to
see
his
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
He
stay
but
a
little
while
,
excuse
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
have
a
cold
;
and
Mary
do
not
reappear
before
he
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
ride
home
,
he
begin
to
be
more
conscious
of
be
ill
,
than
of
be
melancholy
.
  
<EOS>
when
Caleb
Garth
arrive
at
Stone
Court
soon
after
dusk
,
Mary
be
not
surprised
,
although
he
seldom
have
leisure
for
pay
her
a
visit
,
and
be
not
at
all
fond
of
have
to
talk
with
Mr.
Featherstone
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
on
the
other
hand
,
feel
himself
ill
at
ease
with
a
brother
-
in
-
law
whom
he
could
not
annoy
,
who
do
not
mind
about
be
consider
poor
,
have
nothing
to
ask
of
him
,
and
understand
all
kind
of
farming
and
mining
business
better
than
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mary
have
feel
sure
that
her
parent
would
want
to
see
her
,
and
if
her
father
have
not
come
,
she
would
have
obtain
leave
to
go
home
for
an
hour
or
two
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
after
discuss
price
during
tea
with
Mr.
Featherstone
Caleb
rise
to
bid
him
good
-
by
,
and
say
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Mary
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
a
candle
into
another
large
parlor
,
where
there
be
no
fire
,
and
set
down
the
feeble
light
on
the
dark
mahogany
table
,
turn
round
to
her
father
,
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
kiss
him
with
childish
kiss
which
he
delight
in
,
 
the
expression
of
his
large
brow
soften
as
the
expression
of
a
great
beautiful
dog
soften
when
it
be
caress
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
his
favorite
child
,
and
whatever
Susan
may
say
,
and
right
as
she
be
on
all
other
subject
,
Caleb
think
it
natural
that
Fred
or
any
one
else
should
think
Mary
more
lovable
than
other
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
something
to
tell
you

my

Caleb
in
his
hesitating
way

then
it

I

your

have
get

be
the
bad
of
it
,
and
even
they
will
not
quite
make
thing
even

<EOS>
We
want
a
hundred

ten

your

ninety

mean
well

convince

Poor

terror
at
these

of
danger
find
vent
in
such
word
as
come
most
easily
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
it
"
very
ill
usage
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Wrench
,
who
have
attend
their
house
so
many
year
in
preference
to
Mr.
Peacock
,
though
Mr.
Peacock
be
equally
a
friend

<EOS>
why
Mr.

should
neglect
her
child
more
than

she

<EOS>
He
have
not
neglect
Mrs.

would
Mrs.

<EOS>
and
if
anything

"
  
here
poor
Mrs.

quite
break
down

and
her
Niobe
throat
and
good

humored
face
be
sadly
convulse

<EOS>
this
be
in
the

Rosamond
have
open
the

now
come
forward
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
apologize
for
Mr.
Wrench
,
say
that
the
symptom
yesterday
may
have
be
disguise
,
and
that
this
form
of
fever
be
very
equivocal
in
its
beginning
:
he
would
go
immediately
to
the
druggist
's
and
have
a
prescription
make
up
in
order
to
lose
no
time
,
but
he
would
write
to
Mr.
Wrench
and
tell
him
what
have
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
come
again
 
<EOS>
you
must
go
on
attend
Fred

I
can
not

my

I
bear
nobody

ill

will

thank
God

and
Mr.

save
me
in
the
pleurisy

he
would
better
have
let
me
die
 
if
 
if
 
"
  
"
I
will
meet
Mr.
Wrench
here
,
then
,
shall
I
?
"
say
Lydgate
,
really
believe
that
Wrench
be
not
well
prepared
to
deal
wisely
with
a
case
of
this
kind

<EOS>
"
pray
make
that
arrangement

Mr.
Lydgate
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
come
to
her
mother
's
aid

support
her

lead
her
away

<EOS>
when
Mr.
Vincy
come
home
he
be
very
angry
with
Wrench

and
do
not
care
if
he
never
come
into
his
house
again

<EOS>
lydgate
should
go
on
now
,
whether
Wrench
like
it
or
not

<EOS>
It
be
no
joke
to
have
fever
in
the
house

<EOS>
everybody
must
be
send
to

not
to
come
to
dinner
on
Thursday

<EOS>
and
Pritchard

not
get
up

brandy

the
good

<EOS>
"
I
shall
drink
brandy

"
add
Mr.

emphatically

this

<EOS>
He

He

some

by

<EOS>
I
do

do

more
mildly

"
however

shall
know
what
I

<EOS>
(
what
Mr.

think
confusedly
be
,
that
the
fever
may
somehow
have

hinder
if
Wrench
have
show
the
proper
solicitude
about
his
 
the

<EOS>
"
I
be
the
last

new
parson
either
 
whether
they

take
it
as
he
will

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wrench
do
not
take
it
at
all
well
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
as
polite
as
he
could
be
in
his
offhand
way
,
but
politeness
in
a
man
who
have
place
you
at
a
disadvantage
be
only
an
additional
exasperation
,
especially
if
he
happen
to
have
be
an
object
of
dislike
beforehand

<EOS>
country
practitioner
use
to
be
an
irritable
specie
,
susceptible
on
the
point
of
honor
;
and
Mr.
Wrench
be
one
of
the
most
irritable
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
refuse
to
meet
Lydgate
in
the
evening
,
but
his
temper
be
somewhat
try
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
to
hear
Mrs.
Vincy
say
    
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Wrench
,
what
have
I
ever
do
that
you
should
use
me
so
?
   
<EOS>
to
go
away
,
and
never

come
again
!
 
<EOS>
and
my

may
have

<EOS>
Mr.

,
who
have
be
keep
up
a
sharp
fire
on
the
enemy
infection

and
be
a
good
deal
heat
in
consequence
,
start
up
when
he
hear
Wrench
come
in
,
and
go
into
the
hall
to
let
him
know
what
he
think
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Wrench
,
this
be
beyond
a
joke
,
"
say
the
Mayor
,
who
of
late
have
have
to
rebuke
offender
with
an
official
air
,
and
how
broaden
himself
by
put
his
thumb
in
his
armhole
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
let
fever
get
unawares
into
a
house
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
thing
that
ought
to
be
actionable
,
and
be
not
so
  
that
be
my
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
irrational
reproach
be
easy
to
bear
than
the
sense
of
be
instruct
,
or
rather
the
sense
that
a
young
man
,
like
Lydgate
,
inwardly
consider
him
in
need
of
instruction
,
for
"
in
point
of
fact
,
"
Mr.
Wrench
afterwards
say
,
Lydgate
parade
flighty
,
foreign
notion
,
which
would
not
wear
.
 
<EOS>
He
swallow
his
ire
for
the
moment
,
but
he
afterwards
write
to
decline
further
attendance
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
may
be
a
good
one
,
but
Mr.
Wrench
be
not
go
to
truckle
to
anybody
on
a
professional
matter
.
 
<EOS>
He
reflect
,
with
much
probability
on
his
side
,
that
lydgate
would
by
-
and
-
by
be
catch
trip
too
,
and
that
his
ungentlemanly
attempt
to
discredit
the
sale
of
drug
by
his
professional
brother
,
would
by
-
and
-
by
recoil
on
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
throw
out
biting
remark
on
Lydgate
's
trick
,
worthy
only
of
a
quack
,
to
get
himself
a
factitious
reputation
with
credulous
people
.
 
<EOS>
that
can
not
about
cure
be
never
get
up
by
sound
practitioner
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
point
on
which
Lydgate
smart
as
much
as
Wrench
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
puff
by
ignorance
be
not
only
humiliating
,
but
perilous
,
and
not
more
enviable
than
the
reputation
of
the
weather
-
prophet
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
impatient
of
the
foolish
expectation
amidst
which
all
work
must
be
carry
on
,
and
likely
enough
to
damage
himself
as
much
as
Mr.
Wrench
could
wish
,
by
an
unprofessional
openness
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Lydgate
be
instal
as
medical
attendant
on
the
Vincys
,
and
the
event
be
a
subject
of
general
conversation
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
,
that
the
Vincys
have
behave
scandalously
,
that
Mr.
Vincy
have
threaten
Wrench
,
and
that
Mrs.
Vincy
have
accuse
him
of
poison
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
other
be
of
opinion
that
Mr.
Lydgate
's
passing
by
be
providential
,
that
he
be
wonderfully
clever
in
fever
,
and
that
Bulstrode
be
in
the
right
to
bring
him
forward
.
 
<EOS>
many
people
believe
that
Lydgate
be
come
to
the
town
at
all
be
really
due
to
Bulstrode
;
and
Mrs.
Taft
,
who
be
always
count
stitch
and
gather
her
information
in
mislead
fragment
catch
between
the
row
of
her
knitting
,
have
get
it
into
her
head
that
Mr.
Lydgate
be
a
natural
son
of
Bulstrode
's
,
a
fact
which
seem
to
justify
her
suspicion
of
evangelical
layman
.
  
<EOS>
She
one
day
communicate
this
piece
of
knowledge
to
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
who
do
not
fail
to
tell
her
son
of
it
,
observe
    
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
be
surprised
at
anything
in
Bulstrode
,
but
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
it
of
Mr.
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
mother
,
"
say
Mr.
Farebrother
,
after
an
explosive
laugh
,
"
you
know
very
well
that
Lydgate
be
of
a
good
family
in
the
North
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
hear
of
Bulstrode
before
he
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
satisfactory
so
far
as
Mr.
Lydgate
be
concern
,
Camden
,
"
say
the
old
lady
,
with
an
air
of
precision
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
as
to
Bulstrode
 
<EOS>
the
report
may
be
true
of
some
other
son
.
"
        
<EOS>
let
the
high
Muse
chant
love
Olympian
:
    
<EOS>
We
be
but
mortal
,
and
must
sing
of
man

<EOS>
an
eminent
philosopher
among
my

who
can
dignify
even
your
ugly
furniture
by
lift
it
into
the
serene
light
of
science

have
show
me
this
pregnant
little
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Your
pier
-
glass
or
extensive
surface
of
polished
steel
make
to
be
rub
by
a
housemaid
,
will
be
minutely
and
multitudinously
scratch
in
all
direction
;
but
place
now
against
it
a
light
candle
as
a
centre
of
illumination
,
and
lo
!
<EOS>
the
scratch
will
seem
to
arrange
themselves
in
a
fine
series
of
concentric
circle
round
that
little
sun
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
demonstrable
that
the
scratch
be
go
everywhere
impartially
<EOS>
and
it
be
only
your
candle
which
produce
the
flattering
illusion
of
a
concentric
arrangement
,
its
light
fall
with
an
exclusive
optical
selection
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
be
a
parable
.
 
<EOS>
the
scratch
be
event
,
and
the
candle
be
the
egoism
of
any
person
now
absent
 
of
Miss
Vincy
,
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
a
Providence
of
her
own
who
have
kindly
make
her
more
charming
than
other
girl
,
and
who
seem
to
have
arrange
Fred
's
illness
and
Mr.
Wrench
's
mistake
in
order
to
bring
her
and
Lydgate
within
effective
proximity
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
to
contravene
these
arrangement
if
Rosamond
have
consent
to
go
away
to
Stone
Court
or
elsewhere
,
as
her
parent
wish
her
to
do
,
especially
since
Mr.
Lydgate
think
the
precaution
needless
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
while
Miss
Morgan
and
the
child
be
send
away
to
a
farmhouse
the
morning
after
Fred
's
illness
have
declare
itself
,
Rosamond
refuse
to
leave
papa
and
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
poor
mamma
indeed
be
an
object
to
touch
any
creature
bear
of
woman
;
and
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
dote
on
his
wife
,
be
more
alarmed
on
her
account
than
on
Fred
's
.
<EOS>
but
for
his
insistence
she
would
have
take
no
rest
:
her
brightness
be
all
bedim
;
unconscious
of
her
costume
which
have
always
be
so
fresh
and
gay
,
she
be
like
a
sick
bird
with
languid
eye
and
plumage
ruffle
,
her
sense
dull
to
the
sight
and
sound
that
use
most
to
interest
her
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
's
delirium
,
in
which
he
seem
to
be
wander
out
of
her
reach
,
tear
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
after
her
first
outburst
against
Mr.
Wrench
she
go
about
very
quietly
:
her
one
low
cry
be
to
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
follow
him
out
of
the
room
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
moan
out
,
"
save
my
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
once
she
plead
,
"
He
have
always
be
good
to
me
,
Mr.
Lydgate
:
he
never
have
a
hard
word
for
his
mother
,
"
 
as
if
poor
Fred
's
suffering
be
an
accusation
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
deep
fibre
of
the
mother
's
memory
be
stir
,
and
the
young
man
whose
voice
take
a
gentle
tone
when
he
speak
to
her
,
be
one
with
the
babe
whom
she
have
love
,
with
a
love
new
to
her

before
he

<EOS>
"
I
have
good
hope
,
Mrs.
Vincy
,
"
Lydgate
would
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
down
with
me
and
let
us
talk
about
the
food
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
that
way
he
lead
her
to
the
parlor
where
Rosamond
be
,
and
make
a
change
for
her
,
surprise
her
into
take
some
tea
or
broth
which
have
be
prepare
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
constant
understanding
between
him
and
Rosamond
on
these
matter
.
 
<EOS>
He
almost
always
see
her
before
go
to
the
sickroom
,
and
she
appeal
to
him
as
to
what
she
could
do
for
mamma
.
 
<EOS>
Her
presence
of
mind
and
adroitness
in
carry
out
his
hint
be
admirable
,
and
it
be
not
wonderful
that
the
idea
of
see
Rosamond
begin
to
mingle
itself
with
his
interest
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
especially
when
the
critical
stage
be
pass
,
and
he
begin
to
feel
confident
of
Fred
's
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
more
doubtful
time
,
he
have
advise
call
in
Dr.
Sprague
(
who
,
if
he
could
,
would
rather
have
remain
neutral
on
Wrench
's
account
)
;
but
after
two
consultation
,
the
conduct
of
the
case
be
leave
to
Lydgate
,
and
there
be
every
reason
to
make
him
assiduous
.
 
<EOS>
morning
and
evening
he
be
at
Mr.
Vincy
's
,
and
gradually
the
visit
become
cheerful
as
Fred
become
simply
feeble
,
and
lie
not
only
in
need
of
the
utmost
petting
but
conscious
of
it
,
so
that
Mrs.
Vincy
feel
as
if
,
after
all
,
the
illness
have
make
a
festival
for
her
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
both
father
and
mother
hold
it
an
add
reason
for
good
spirit
,
when
old
Mr.
Featherstone
send
message
by
Lydgate
,
say
that
Fred
must
make
haste
and
get
well
,
as
he
,
Peter
Featherstone
,
could
not
do
without
him
,
and
miss
his
visit
sadly

<EOS>
the
old
man
himself
be
get
bedridden

<EOS>
Mrs.
Vincy
tell
these
message
to
Fred
when
he
could
listen
,
and
he
turn
towards
her
his
delicate
,
pinched
face
,
from
which
all
the
thick
blond
hair
have
be
cut
away
,
and
in
which
the
eye
seem
to
have
get
large

yearn
for
some
word
about
Mary
 
wonder
what
she
feel
about
his
illness

<EOS>
no
word
pass
his
lip

the
mother
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
not
only
divine
Fred
's
longing
,
but
feel
ready
for
any
sacrifice
in
order
to
satisfy
him

<EOS>
"
if
I
can
only
see
my
boy
strong
again
,
"
she
say
,
in
her
loving
folly
;

and
who
know
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
master
of
Stone
Court
!
<EOS>
and
he
can
marry
anybody
he
like
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
if
they
will
not
have
me
,
mother
,
"
say
Fred
.
 
<EOS>
the
illness
have
make
him
childish
,
and
tear
come
as
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
take
a
bit
of
jelly
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Vincy
,
secretly
incredulous
of
any
such
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
She
never
leave
Fred
's
side
when
her
husband
be
not
in
the
house
,
and
thus
Rosamond
be
in
the
unusual
position
of
be
much
alone
.
<EOS>
lydgate
,
naturally
,
never
think
of
stay
long
with
her
,
yet
it
seem
that
the
brief
impersonal
conversation
they
have
together
be
create
that
peculiar
intimacy
which
consist
in
shyness
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
oblige
to
look
at
each
other
in
speak
,
and
somehow
the
look
could
not
be
carry
through
as
the
matter
of
course
which
it
really
be
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
begin
to
feel
this
sort
of
consciousness
unpleasant
and
one
day
look
down
,
or
anywhere
,
like
an
ill
-
work
puppet
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
turn
out
badly
:
the
next
day
,
Rosamond
look
down
,
and
the
consequence
be
that
when
their
eye
meet
again
,
both
be
more
conscious
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
help
for
this
in
science
,
and
as
Lydgate
do
not
want
to
flirt
,
there
seem
to
be
no
help
for
it
in
folly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
a
relief
when
neighbor
no
longer
consider
the
house
in
quarantine
,
and
when
the
chance
of
see
Rosamond
alone
be
very
much
reduce
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
intimacy
of
mutual
embarrassment
,
in
which
each
feel
that
the
other
be
feel
something
,
have
once
exist
,
its
effect
be
not
to
be
do
away
with
.
 
<EOS>
talk
about
the
weather
and
other
well
-
breed
topic
be
apt
to
seem
a
hollow
device
,
and
behavior
can
hardly
become
easy
unless
it
frankly
recognize
a
mutual
fascination
 
<EOS>
which
of
course
nee
not
mean
anything
deep
or
serious
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
way
in
which
Rosamond
and
Lydgate
slide
gracefully
into
ease
,
and
make
their
intercourse
lively
again
.
 
<EOS>
visitor
come
and
go
as
usual
,
there
be
once
more
music
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
all
the
extra
hospitality
of
Mr.
Vincy
's
mayoralty
return
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
whenever
he
could
,
take
his
seat
by
Rosamond
's
side
,
and
linger
to
hear
her
music
,
call
himself
her
captive
 
meaning
,
all
the
while
,
not
to
be
her
captive
.
 
<EOS>
the
preposterousness
of
the
notion
that
he
could
at
once
set
up
a
satisfactory
establishment
as
a
married
man
be
a
sufficient
guarantee
against
danger
.
 
<EOS>
this
play
at
be
a
little
in
love
be
agreeable
,
and
do
not
interfere
with
graver
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
Flirtation
,
after
all
,
be
not
necessarily
a
singeing
process
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
for
her
part
,
have
never
enjoy
the
day
so
much
in
her
life
before
:
she
be
sure
of
be
admire
by
some
one
worth
captivating
,
and
she
do
not
distinguish
flirtation
from
love
,
either
in
herself
or
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
sail
with
a
fair
wind
<EOS>
just
whither
she
would
go
,
and
her
thought
be
much
occupy
with
a
handsome
house
in
Lowick
Gate
which
she
hope
would
by
-
and
-
by
be
vacant
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
determined
,
when
she
be
marry
,
to
rid
herself
adroitly
of
all
the
visitor
who
be
not
agreeable
to
her
at
her
father
's
;
and
she
imagine
the
drawing
-
room
in
her
favorite
house
with
various
style
of
furniture
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
her
thought
be
much
occupy
with
Lydgate
himself
;
he
seem
to
her
almost
perfect
:
if
he
have
know
his
note
so
that
his
enchantment
under
her
music
have
be
less
like
an
emotional
elephant
's
,
and
if
he
have
be
able
to
discriminate
well
the
refinement
of
her
taste
in
dress
,
she
could
hardly
have
mention
a
deficiency
in
him
.
<EOS>
how
different
he
be
from
young
Plymdale
or
Mr.
Caius
Larcher
!
 
<EOS>
those
young
man
have
not
a
notion
of
French
,
and
could
speak
on
no
subject
with
striking
knowledge
,
except
perhaps
the
dyeing
and
carry
trade
,
which
of
course
they
be
ashamed
to
mention
;
they
be
Middlemarch
gentry
,
elate
with
their
silver
-
head
whip
and
satin
stock
,
but
embarrassed
in
their
manner
,
and
timidly
jocose
:
even
Fred
be
above
them
,
have
at
least
the
accent
and
manner
of
a
university
man
.
<EOS>
whereas
Lydgate
be
always
listen
to
,
bore
himself
with
the
careless
politeness
of
conscious
superiority
,
and
seem
to
have
the
right
clothe
on
by
a
certain
natural
affinity
,
without
ever
have
to
think
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
proud
when
he
enter
the
room
,
and
when
he
approach
her
with
a
distinguish
smile
,
she
have
a
delicious
sense
that
she
be
the
object
of
enviable
homage
.
 
<EOS>
if
Lydgate
have
be
aware
of
all
the
pride
he
excite
in
that
delicate
bosom
,
he
may
have
be
just
as
well
pleased
as
any
other
man
,
even
the
most
densely
ignorant
of
humoral
pathology
or
fibrous
tissue
:
he
hold
it
one
of
the
pretty
attitude
of
the
feminine
mind
to
adore
a
man
's
pre
-
eminence
without
too
precise
a
knowledge
of
what
it
consist
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
be
not
one
of
those
helpless
girl
who
betray
themselves
unawares
,
and
whose
behavior
be
awkwardly
drive
by
their
impulse
,
instead
of
be
steer
by
wary
grace
and
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
that
her
rapid
forecast
and
rumination
concern
house
-
furniture
and
society
be
ever
discernible
in
her
conversation
,
even
with
her
mamma
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
would
have
express
the
prettiest
surprise
and
disapprobation
if
she
have
hear
that
another
young
lady
have
be
detect
in
that
immodest
prematureness
 
indeed
,
would
probably
have
disbelieve
in
its
possibility
.
 
<EOS>
for
Rosamond
never
show
any
unbecoming
knowledge
,
and
be
always
that
combination
of
correct
sentiment
,
music
,
dancing
,
drawing
,
elegant
note
-
writing
,
private
album
for
extract
verse
,
and
perfect
blond
loveliness
,
which
make
the
irresistible
woman
for
the
doom
man
of
that
date
.
 
<EOS>
think
no
unfair
evil
of
her
,
pray
:
<EOS>
she
have
no
wicked
plot
,
nothing
sordid
or
mercenary
;
in
fact
,
she
never
think
of
money
except
as
something
necessary
which
other
people
would
always
provide
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
the
habit
of
devise
falsehood
,
and
if
her
statement
be
no
direct
clew
to
fact
,
why
,
they
be
not
intend
in
that
light
 
<EOS>
they
be
among
her
elegant
accomplishment
,
intend
to
please
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
have
inspire
many
art
in
finish
Mrs.
Lemon
's
favorite
pupil
,
who
by
general
consent
(
Fred
's
except
)
be
a
rare
compound
of
beauty
,
cleverness
,
and
amiability
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
find
it
more
and
more
agreeable
to
be
with
her
,
and
there
be
no
constraint
now
,
there
be
a
delightful
interchange
of
influence
in
their
eye
,
and
what
they
say
have
that
superfluity
of
mean
for
them
,
which
be
observable
with
some
sense
of
flatness
by
a
third
person
;
still
they
have
no
interview
or
aside
from
which
a
third
person
nee
have
be
exclude
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
flirt
;
and
Lydgate
be
secure
in
the
belief
that
they
do
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
man
could
not
love
and
be
wise
,
surely
he
could
flirt
and
be
wise
at
the
same
time
?
<EOS>
really
,
the
man
in
Middlemarch
,
except
Mr.
Farebrother
,
be
great
bore
,
and
Lydgate
do
not
care
about
commercial
politic
or
card
<EOS>
:
what
be
he
to
do
for
relaxation
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
often
invite
to
the
bulstrode
'
;
but
the
girl
there
be
hardly
out
of
the
schoolroom
;
and
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
_
naive
_
way
of
conciliate
piety
and
worldliness
,
the
nothingness
of
this
life
and
the
desirability
of
cut
glass
,
the
consciousness
at
once
of
filthy
rag
and
the
good
damask
,
be
not
a
sufficient
relief
from
the
weight
of
her
husband
's
invariable
seriousness
.
 
<EOS>
the
Vincys
'
house
,
with
all
its
fault
,
be
the
pleasanter
by
contrast
;
besides
,
it
nourish
Rosamond
 
sweet
to
look
at
as
a
half
-
open
blush
-
rose
,
and
adorn
with
accomplishment
for
the
refined
amusement
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
make
some
enemy
,
other
than
medical
,
by
his
success
with
Miss
Vincy
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
he
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
rather
late
,
when
several
other
visitor
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
card
-
table
have
draw
off
the
elder
,
and
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
(
one
of
the
good
match
in
Middlemarch
,
though
not
one
of
its
leading
mind
)
be
in
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
Rosamond
.
<EOS>
He
have
bring
the
last
"
Keepsake
,
"
the
gorgeous
water
-
silk
publication
which
mark
modern
progress
at
that
time
;
and
he
consider
himself
very
fortunate
that
he
could
be
the
first
to
look
over
it
with
her
,
dwell
on
the
lady
and
gentleman
with
shiny
copper
-
plate
cheek
and
copper
-
plate
smile
,
and
point
to
comic
verse
as
capital
and
sentimental
story
as
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
gracious
,
and
Mr.
Ned
be
satisfied
that
he
have
the
very
good
thing
in
art
and
literature
as
a
medium
for
"
pay
address
"
 
the
very
thing
to
please
a
nice
girl
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
also
reason
,
deep
rather
than
ostensible
,
for
be
satisfied
with
his
own
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
to
superficial
observer
his
chin
have
too
vanish
an
aspect
,
look
as
if
it
be
be
gradually
reabsorb
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
do
indeed
cause
him
some
difficulty
about
the
fit
of
his
satin
stock
,
for
which
chin
be
at
that
time
useful
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
honorable
Mrs.
S.
be
something
like
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Ned
.
<EOS>
He
keep
the
book
open
at
the
bewitching
portrait
,
and
look
at
it
rather
languishingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
back
be
very
large
;
she
seem
to
have
sit
for
that
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
not
mean
any
satire
,
but
think
how
red
young
Plymdale
's
hand
be
,
and
wonder
why
Lydgate
do
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
on
with
her
tat
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
she
be
as
beautiful
as
you
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Ned
,
venture
to
look
from
the
portrait
to
its
rival
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
you
of
be
an
adroit
flatterer
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
feel
sure
that
she
should
have
to
reject
this
young
gentleman
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
Lydgate
come
in
;
the
book
be
close
before
he
reach
Rosamond
's
corner
,
and
as
he
take
his
seat
with
easy
confidence
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
young
Plymdale
's
jaw
fall
like
a
barometer
towards
the
cheerless
side
of
change
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
enjoy
not
only
Lydgate
's
presence
but
its
effect
:
she
like
to
excite
jealousy
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
late
comer
you
be
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
as
they
shake
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mamma
have
give
you
up
a
little
while
ago
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
find
Fred
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
as
usual
;
go
on
well
,
but
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
go
away
 
to
Stone
Court
,
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
but
your
mamma
seem
to
have
some
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
say
Rosamond
,
prettily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
Fred
so
change
,
"
she
add
,
turn
to
the
other
suitor
;
"
we
have
look
to
Mr.
Lydgate
as
our
guardian
angel
during
this
illness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Ned
smile
nervously
,
while
Lydgate
,
draw
the
"
Keepsake
"
towards
him
and
open
it
,
give
a
short
scornful
laugh
and
toss
up
his
chin
,
as
if
in
wonderment
at
human
folly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
laugh
at
so
profanely
?
"
<EOS>
say
Rosamond
,
with
bland
neutrality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
which
would
turn
out
to
be
the
silly
 
<EOS>
the
engraving
or
the
writing
here
<EOS>
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
in
his
most
convinced
tone
,
while
he
turn
over
the
page
quickly
,
seem
to
see
all
through
the
book
in
no
time
,
and
show
his
large
white
hand
to
much
advantage
,
as
Rosamond
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
look
at
this
bridegroom
come
out
of
church
:
do
you
ever
see
such
a
"
sugared
invention
"
 
as
the
Elizabethans
use
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
do
any
haberdasher
ever
look
so
smirk
?
 
<EOS>
yet
I
will
answer
for
it
<EOS>
the
story
make
him
one
of
the
first
gentleman
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
severe
,
I
be
frightened
at
you
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
keep
her
amusement
duly
moderate
.
 
<EOS>
poor
young
Plymdale
have
linger
with
admiration
over
this
very
engraving
,
and
his
spirit
be
stir
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
great
many
celebrated
people
write
in
the
"
Keepsake
,
"
at
all
event

he
say
,
in
a
tone
at
once
pique
and
timid
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
first
time
I
have
hear
it
call
silly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
turn
round
on
you
and
accuse
you
of
be
a
Goth

"
say
Rosamond
,
look
at
Lydgate
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
you
know
nothing
about
Lady
Blessington
and
L.
E.
L.

<EOS>
Rosamond
herself
be
not
without
relish
for
these
writer
,
but
she
do
not
readily
commit
herself
by
admiration
,
and
be
alive
to
the
slight
hint
that
anything
be
not

accord
to
Lydgate
,
in
the
very
high
taste
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
Sir
Walter
Scott
 
I
suppose
Mr.

young
Plymdale

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
read
no
literature
now
,
"

Lydgate
,
shut
the

,
and
push
it
away

<EOS>
"
I
read
so
much
when
I
be
a

that
I
suppose
it

last
me
all
my

<EOS>
I
use
to

Scott

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
when
you
leave
off

Rosamond

then
I

"
Mr.

Mr.

purposely
caustic

"
on
the
contrary

"
say
Lydgate
,
show
no

smile
with
exasperate
confidence
at
Rosamond

<EOS>
"
It
would
be
worth

the
fact

"
  
<EOS>
Young
Plymdale
soon
go
to
look
at

think
that
Lydgate
be
one
of
the
most
conceited
,
unpleasant
fellow
it
have
ever
be
his
ill

fortune
to
meet

<EOS>
"
how
rash
you
be

Rosamond

inwardly
delighted

"
do
you
see
that
you
have
give
offence

"
  
<EOS>
"
what

be
it
Mr.

<EOS>
I
be
sorry

I

<EOS>

I
shall
begin

what

first
come

that
you

want
teaching

well

there

<EOS>
do
not
I
listen

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
Rosamond
it
seem
as
if
she
and
Lydgate
be
as
good
as
engage
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
some
time
to
be
engage
have
long
be
an
idea

idea

we

be
at

<EOS>
It
be
true
,
Lydgate
have
the
counter
-
idea
of
remain
unengage
;
but
this
be
a
mere
negative
,
a
shadow
cast
by
other
resolve
which
themselves
be
capable
of
shrink
.
 
<EOS>
Circumstance
be
almost
sure
to
be
on
the
side
of
Rosamond
's
idea
,
which
have
a
shape
activity
and
look
through
watchful
blue
eye
,
whereas
Lydgate
's
lay
blind

unconcerned
as

<EOS>
that
evening

he
look

be
go
on

with
undisturbed

he
write

<EOS>
the
reverie
from
which
it
be

himself
be
ideal

of
something
else

<EOS>
a

and
in

morning
,
when
Dorothea

avenue
the

green
boudoir
that
we

the

avenue

their
trunk
from
a
white
earth
,
and
spread
white

against
the
dun

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

furniture
in

seem
to
have
shrink
since
she
see
it
before
:
the
stag
in
the
tapestry
look
more
like
a
ghost
in
his
ghostly
blue
-
green
world
;
the
volume
of
polite
literature
in
the
bookcase
look
more
like
immovable
imitation
of
book
.
 
<EOS>
the
bright
fire
of
dry
oak
-
bough
burn
on
the
log
seem
an
incongruous
renewal
of
life
and
glow
 
like
the
figure
of
Dorothea
herself
as
she
enter
carry
the
red

contain
the
cameo
for
Celia

<EOS>
She
be
glow
from

toilet
as
only
healthful
youth
can
glow

there
be
gem

like
brightness
on
her
coiled
hair
and
in
her
hazel
eye
;
there
be
warm
red
life
in
her
lip
;
her
throat
have
a
breathing
whiteness
above
the
differ
white
of
the
fur
which
itself
seem
to
wind
about
her
neck
and
cling
down
her
blue
-
gray
pelisse
with
a
tenderness
gather
from
her
own
,
a
sentient
commingle
innocence
which
keep
its
loveliness
against
the
crystalline
purity
of
the
outdoor
snow
.
<EOS>
as
she
lay
the
cameo
-
case
on
the
table
in
the

she
unconsciously
keep
her

Mr.

through
the
next
week
there
would
be
wedding
visit
receive
and
give

all
in
continuance
of
that
transitional
life
understand
to
correspond
with
the
excitement
of
bridal
felicity
,
and
keep
up
the
sense
of
busy
ineffectiveness
,
as
of
a
dream
which
the
dreamer
begin
to
suspect
.
<EOS>
the
duty
of
her
married
life
,
contemplate
as
so
great
beforehand
,
seem
to
be
shrink
with
the
furniture
and
the
white
vapor
-
walled
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
the
clear
height
where
she
expect
to
walk
in
full
communion
have
become
difficult
to
see
even
in
her
imagination
;
the
delicious
repose
of
the
soul
on
a
complete
superior
have
be
shake
into
uneasy
effort
and
alarm
with
dim
presentiment
.
 
<EOS>
when
would
the
day
begin
of
that
active
wifely
devotion
which
be
to
strengthen
her
husband
's
life
and
exalt
her
own

<EOS>
never
perhaps
,
as
she
have
preconceive
them
;
but
somehow
 
still
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
solemnly
pledge
union
of
her
life
,
duty
would
present
itself
in
some
new
form
of
inspiration
and
give
a
new

to
wifely
love

<EOS>
meanwhile
there
be
the
snow
and
the
low
arch
of
dun
vapor
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
stifle
oppression
of
that
gentlewoman
's
world
,
where
everything
be
do
for
her
and
none
ask
for
her
aid
 
where
the
sense
of
connection
with
a
manifold
pregnant
existence
have
to
be
keep
up
painfully
as
an
inward
vision
,
instead
of
come

<EOS>
"
what

I

<EOS>
"
whatever
you

my

<EOS>
that
have
be
her
brief
history
since
she
have
leave
off
learning
morning
lesson
and
practise
silly
rhythm
on
the

piano
.
 
<EOS>
marriage
,
which
be
to
bring
guidance
into
worthy
and
imperative
occupation
,
have
not
yet
free
her
from
the
gentlewoman
's
oppressive
liberty
:
it
have
not
even
fill
her
leisure
with
the
ruminant
joy
of
unchecked
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
blooming
full
-
pulse
youth
stand
there
in
a
moral
imprisonment
which
make
itself
one
with
the
chill
,
colorless
,
narrow
landscape
,
with
the
shrunken
furniture
,
the
never
-
read
book
,
and
the
ghostly
stag
in
a
pale
fantastic
world
that
seem
to
be
vanish
from
the
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
minute
when
Dorothea
look
out
she
feel
nothing
but
the
dreary
oppression
;
then
come
a
keen
remembrance
,
and
turn
away
from
the
window
<EOS>
she
walk
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
and
hope
which
be
live
in
her
mind
when
she
first
see
this
room
nearly
three
month
before
be
present
now
only
as
memory
:
she
judge
them
as
we
judge
transient
and
depart
thing
.
 
<EOS>
all
existence
seem
to
beat
with
a
low
pulse
than
her
own
,
and
her
religious
faith
be
a
solitary
cry
,
the
struggle
out
of
a
nightmare
in
which
every
object
be
wither
and
shrink
away
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
each
remember
thing
in
the
room
be
disenchant
,
be
deaden
as
an
unlit
transparency
,
till
her
wander
gaze
come
to
the
group
of
miniature
,
and
there
at
last
she
see
something
which
have
gather
new
breath
and
meaning
:
it
be
the
miniature
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
aunt
Julia
,
who
have
make
the
unfortunate
marriage
 
of
Will
Ladislaw
's
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
could
fancy
that
it
be
alive
now
 
the
delicate
woman
's
face
which
yet
have
a
headstrong
look
,
a
peculiarity
difficult
to
interpret
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
only
her
friend
who
think
her
marriage
unfortunate
?
<EOS>
or
do
she
herself
find
it
out
to
be
a
mistake
,
and
taste
the
salt
bitterness
of
her
tear
in
the
merciful
silence
of
the
night
?
 
<EOS>
what
breadth
of
experience
Dorothea
seem
to
have
pass
over
since
she
first
look
at
this
miniature
!
<EOS>
She
feel
a
new
companionship
with
it
,
as
if
it
have
an
ear
for
her
and
could
see
how
she
be
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
woman
who
have
know
some
difficulty
about
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
color
deepen
,
the
lip
and
chin
seem
to
get
large
,
the
hair
and
eye
seem
to
be
send
out
light
,
the
face
be
masculine
and
beam
on
her
with
that
full
gaze
which
tell
her
on
whom
it
fall
that
she
be
too
interesting
for
the
slight
movement
of
her
eyelid
to
pass
unnoticed
and
uninterpreted
.
<EOS>
the
vivid
presentation
come
like
a
pleasant
glow
to
Dorothea
:
she
feel
herself
smile
,
and
turn
from
the
miniature
sit
down
and
look
up
as
if
she
be
again
talk
to
a
figure
in
front
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
smile
disappear
as
she
go
on
meditating
,
and
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
aloud
    
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
cruel
to
speak
so
!
 
<EOS>
how
sad
 
how
dreadful
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
rise
quickly
and
go
out
of
the
room
,
hurry
along
the
corridor
,
with
the
irresistible
impulse
to
go
and
see
her
husband
and
inquire
if
she
could
do
anything
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
Mr.
Tucker
be
go
and
Mr.
Casaubon
be
alone
in
the
library
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
as
if
all
her
morning
's
gloom
would
vanish
if
she
could
see
her
husband
glad
because
of
her
presence
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
she
reach
the
head
of
the
dark
oak
there
be
Celia
come
up
,
and
below
there
be
Mr.
Brooke
,
exchange
welcome
and
congratulation
with
Mr.
Casaubon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dodo
!
"
say
Celia
,
in
her
quiet
staccato
;
then
kiss
her
sister
,
whose
arm
encircle
her
,
and
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
both
cry
a
little
in
a
furtive
manner
,
while
Dorothea
run
down
-
stair
to
greet
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
ask
how
you
be

"
say
Mr.
Brooke
,
after
kiss
her
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rome

agree

I

study
hard

it
at
one
time

<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
still
hold
Dorothea
's
hand
,
but
have
turn
his
face
to
Mr.
Casaubon
 
"
about
topography
,
ruin
,
temple
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
a
clew

I
see
it
would
carry
me
too
far

nothing

come

You

go
any

<EOS>
Dorothea
's
eye
also
be
turn
up
to
her
husband
's
face
with
some
anxiety
at
the
idea
that
those
who
see
him
afresh
after
absence
may
be
aware
of
sign
which
she
have
not
notice

<EOS>
"
nothing
to
alarm
you

say
Mr.
Brooke

observe
her
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
little
english
beef

mutton

soon
make

It
be

<EOS>
one
morning
,
some
week
after
her
arrival
at
Lowick
,
Dorothea
 
<EOS>
but
why
always
Dorothea
?
 
<EOS>
be
her
point
of
view
the
only
possible
one
with
regard
to
this
marriage
?
 
<EOS>
I
protest
against
all
our
interest
,
all
our
effort
at
understanding
be
give
to
the
young
skin
that
look
bloom
in
spite
of
trouble
;
for
these
too
will
get
fade
,
and
will
know
the
old
and
more
eat
griefs
which
we
be
help
to
neglect
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
blink
eye
and
white
mole
objectionable
to
Celia
,
and
the
want
of
muscular
curve
which
be
morally
painful
to
Sir
James
,
Mr.
Casaubon
have
an
intense
consciousness
within
him
,
and
be
spiritually
a
-
hunger
like
the
rest
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
do
nothing
exceptional
in
marry
 
nothing
but
what
society
sanction
,
and
consider
an
occasion
for
wreath
and
bouquet
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
occur
to
him
that
he
must
not
any
longer
defer
his
intention
of
matrimony
,
and
he
have
reflect
that
in
take
a
wife
,
a
man
of
good
position
should
expect
and
carefully
choose
a
bloom
young
lady
 
the
young
the
well
,
because
more
educable
and
submissive
 
of
a
rank
equal
to
his
own
,
of
religious
principle
,
virtuous
disposition
,
and
good
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
on
such
a
young
lady
he
would
make
handsome
settlement
,
and
he
would
neglect
no
arrangement
for
her
happiness
:
in
return
,
he
should
receive
family
pleasure
and
leave
behind
him
that
copy
of
himself
which
seem
so
urgently
require
of
a
man
 
to
the
sonneteer
of
the
sixteenth
century
.
 
<EOS>
Times
have
alter
since
then
,
and
no
sonneteer
have
insist
on
Mr.
Casaubon
's
leave
a
copy
of
himself
;
moreover
,
he
have
not
yet
succeed
in
issue
copy
of
his
mythological
key
;
but
he
have
always
intend
to
acquit
himself
by
marriage
,
and
the
sense
that
he
be
fast
leave
the
year
behind
him
,
that
the
world
be
get
dimmer
and
that
he
feel
lonely
,
be
a
reason
to
him
for
lose
no
more
time
in
overtake
domestic
delight
before
they
too
be
leave
behind
by
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
see
Dorothea
he
believe
that
he
have
find
even
more
than
he
demand
:
she
may
really
be
such
a
helpmate
to
him
as
would
enable
him
to
dispense
with
a
hire
secretary
,
an
aid
which
Mr.
Casaubon
have
never
yet
employ
and
have
a
suspicious
dread
of
.
 
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Casaubon
be
nervously
conscious
that
he
be
expect
to
manifest
a
powerful
mind
.
)
 
<EOS>
Providence
,
in
its
kindness
,
have
supply
him
with
the
wife
he
need
.
 
<EOS>
a
wife
,
a
modest
young
lady
,
with
the
purely
appreciative
,
unambitious
ability
of
her
sex
,
be
sure
to
think
her
husband
's
mind
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
whether
Providence
have
take
equal
care
of
Miss
Brooke
in
present
her
with
Mr.
Casaubon
be
an
idea
which
could
hardly
occur
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Society
never
make
the
preposterous
demand
that
a
man
should
think
as
much
about
his
own
qualification
for
make
a
charming
girl
happy
as
he
think
of
hers
for
make
himself
happy
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
a
man
could
choose
not
only
his
wife
but
his
wife
's
husband
!
 
<EOS>
or
as
if
he
be
bind
to
provide
charm
for
his
posterity
in
his
own
person
!
   
<EOS>
when
Dorothea
accept
him
with
effusion
,
that
be
only
natural
;
and
Mr.
Casaubon
believe
that
his
happiness
be
go
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
have
much
foretaste
of
happiness
in
his
previous
life
.
 
<EOS>
to
know
intense
joy
without
a
strong
bodily
frame
,
one
must
have
an
enthusiastic
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
have
never
have
a
strong
bodily
frame
,
and
his
soul
be
sensitive
without
be
enthusiastic
:
it
be
too
languid
to
thrill
out
of
self
-
consciousness
into
passionate
delight
;
it
go
on
flutter
in
the
swampy
ground
where
it
be
hatch
,
think
of
its
wing
and
never
fly
.
 
<EOS>
His
experience
be
of
that
pitiable
kind
which
shrink
from
pity
,
and
fear
most
of
all
that
it
should
be
know
:
it
be
that
proud
narrow
sensitiveness
which
have
not
mass
enough
to
spare
for
transformation
into
sympathy
,
and
quiver
thread
-
like
in
small
current
of
self
-
preoccupation
or
at
good
of
an
egoistic
scrupulosity
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Casaubon
have
many
scruple
<EOS>
:
he
be
capable
of
a
severe
self
-
restraint
;
he
be
resolute
in
be
a
man
of
honor
accord
to
the
code
;
he
would
be
unimpeachable
by
any
recognize
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
in
conduct
these
end
have
be
attain
;
but
the
difficulty
of
make
his
key
to
all
mythology
unimpeachable
weigh
like
lead
upon
his
mind
;
and
the
pamphlet
 
or
"
Parerga
"
as
he
call
them
 
by
which
he
test
his
public
and
deposit
small
monumental
record
of
his
march
,
be
far
from
have
be
see
in
all
their
significance
.
<EOS>
He
suspect
the
Archdeacon
of
not
have
read
them
;
he
be
in
painful
doubt
as
to
what
be
really
think
of
them
by
the
lead
mind
of
Brasenose
,
and
bitterly
convince
that
his
old
acquaintance
Carp
have
be
the
writer
of
that
depreciatory
recension
which
be
keep
lock
in
a
small
drawer
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
desk
,
and
also
in
a
dark
closet
of
his
verbal
memory
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
heavy
impression
to
struggle
against
,
and
bring
that
melancholy
embitterment
which
be
the
consequence
of
all
excessive
claim
:
even
his
religious
faith
waver
with
his
wavering
trust
in
his
own
authorship
,
and
the
consolation
of
the
christian
hope
in
immortality
seem
to
lean
on
the
immortality
of
the
still
unwritten
Key
to
all
Mythologies
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
part
I
be
very
sorry
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
uneasy
lot
at
good
,
to
be
what
we
call
highly
teach
and
yet
not
to
enjoy
:
to
be
present
at
this
great
spectacle
of
life
and
never
to
be
liberate
from
a
small
hungry
shivering
self
 
never
to
be
fully
possess
by
the
glory
we
behold
,
never
to
have
our
consciousness
rapturously
transform
into
the
vividness
of
a
thought
,
the
ardor
of
a
passion
,
the
energy
of
an
action
,
but
always
to
be
scholarly
and
uninspired
,
ambitious
and
timid
,
scrupulous
and
dim
-
sighted
.
<EOS>
become
a
dean
or
even
a
bishop
would
make
little
difference
,
I
fear
,
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
doubtless
some
ancient
Greek
have
observe
that
behind
the
big
mask
and
the
speaking
-
trumpet
,
there
must
always
be
our
poor
little
eye
peep
as
usual
and
our
timorous
lip
more
or
less
under
anxious
control
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
mental
estate
map
out
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
,
to
sensibility
thus
fence
in
,
Mr.
Casaubon
have
think
of
annex
happiness
with
a
lovely
young
bride
;
but
even
before
marriage
,
as
we
have
see
,
he
find
himself
under
a
new
depression
in
the
consciousness
that
the
new
bliss
be
not
blissful
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
inclination
yearn
back
to
its
old
,
easy
custom
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
deep
he
go
in
domesticity
<EOS>
the
more
do
the
sense
of
acquit
himself
and
act
with
propriety
predominate
over
any
other
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
marriage
,
like
religion
and
erudition
,
nay
,
like
authorship
itself
,
be
fate
to
become
an
outward
requirement
,
and
Edward
Casaubon
be
bent
on
fulfil
unimpeachably
all
requirement
.
 
<EOS>
even
draw
Dorothea
into
use
in
his
study
,
accord
to
his
own
intention
before
marriage
,
be
an
effort
which
he
be
always
tempt
to
defer
,
and
but
for
her
plead
insistence
it
may
never
have
begin
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
succeed
in
make
it
a
matter
of
course
that
she
should
take
her
place
at
an
early
hour
in
the
library
and
have
work
either
of
read
aloud
or
copy
assign
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
work
have
be
easy
to
define
because
Mr.
Casaubon
have
adopt
an
immediate
intention
:
there
be
to
be
a
new
Parergon
,
a
small
monograph
on
some
lately
trace
indication
concern
the
egyptian
mystery
whereby
certain
assertion
of
Warburton
's
could
be
correct
.
<EOS>
reference
be
extensive
even
here
,
but
not
altogether
shoreless
;
and
sentence
be
actually
to
be
write
in
the
shape
wherein
they
would
be
scan
by
Brasenose
and
a
less
formidable
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
these
minor
monumental
production
be
always
exciting
to
Mr.
Casaubon
;
digestion
be
make
difficult
by
the
interference
of
citation
,
or
by
the
rivalry
of
dialectical
phrase
ring
against
each
other
in
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
and
from
the
first
there
be
to
be
a
latin
dedication
about
which
everything
be
uncertain
except
that
it
be
not
to
be
address
to
Carp
:
it
be
a
poisonous
regret
to
Mr.
Casaubon
that
he
have
once
address
a
dedication
to
Carp
in
which
he
have
number
that
member
of
the
animal
kingdom
among
the
viros
nullo
aevo
perituros
,
a
mistake
which
would
infallibly
lay
the
dedicator
open
to
ridicule
in
the
next
age
,
and
may
even
be
chuckle
over
by
Pike
and
Tench
in
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Mr.
Casaubon
be
in
one
of
his
busy
epochs
,
and
as
I
begin
to
say
a
little
while
ago
,
Dorothea
join
him
early
in
the
library
where
he
have
breakfast
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Celia
at
this
time
be
on
a
second
visit
to
Lowick
,
probably
the
last
before
her
marriage
,
and
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
expect
Sir
James
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
learn
to
read
the
sign
of
her
husband
's
mood
,
and
she
see
that
the
morning
have
become
more
foggy
there
during
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
silently
to
her
desk
when
he
say
,
in
that
distant
tone
which
imply
that
he
be
discharge
a
disagreeable
duty
    
"
Dorothea
,
here
be
a
letter
for
you
,
which
be
enclose
in
one
address
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
letter
of
two
page
,
and
she
immediately
look
at
the
signature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Ladislaw
!
 
<EOS>
what
can
he
have
to
say
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
in
a
tone
of
pleased
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
she
add
,
look
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
"
I
can
imagine
what
he
have
write
to
you
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
if
you
please
,
read
the
letter
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
severely
point
to
it
with
his
pen
,
and
not
look
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
may
as
well
say
beforehand
,
that
I
must
decline
the
proposal
it
contain
to
pay
a
visit
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
I
may
be
excuse
for
desire
an
interval
of
complete
freedom
from
such
distraction
as
have
be
hitherto
inevitable
,
and
especially
from
guest
whose
desultory
vivacity
make
their
presence
a
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
clashing
of
temper
between
Dorothea
and
her
husband
since
that
little
explosion
in
Rome

which
have
leave
such
strong
trace
in
her
mind
that
it
have
be
easy
ever
since
to
quell
emotion
than
to
incur
the
consequence
of
vent
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
ill
-
temper
anticipation
that
she
could
desire
visit
which
may
be
disagreeable
to
her
husband
,
this
gratuitous
defence
of
himself
against
selfish
complaint

be
too
sharp
a
sting
to

on

Dorothea
have
think
that
she
could
have
be
patient
with
John
Milton
,
but
she
have
never
imagine
him
behave
in
this
way

and
for
a
moment
Mr.

seem
to
be
stupidly
undiscerning
and
odiously
unjust
.
 
<EOS>
pity
,
that
"
new

"
which
be
by
-
and

rule
many
a
storm
within

the

on

<EOS>
with
her
first
word

utter
in
a
tone
that
shake
him
,
she
startle
Mr.

into
look
at
her

the
flash
of
her
eye

<EOS>
"
why
do
you
attribute
to
me
a
wish
for
anything
that

annoy
you

<EOS>
You

"
Dorothea
,
you
be
hasty

"
answer
Mr.

,
nervously
.
  
<EOS>
decidedly
,
this
woman
be
too
young
to
be
on
the
formidable
level
of
wifehood
 
unless
she
have
be
pale
and
featureless
and
take
everything
for
grant

<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
you
who
be
first
hasty
in
your
false
supposition
about
my
feeling

"
say
Dorothea
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
the
fire
be
not
dissipate
yet
,
and
she
think
it
be
ignoble
in
her
husband
not
to
apologize
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
,
if
you
please
,
say
no
more
on
this
subject

Dorothea

<EOS>
I
have
neither
leisure
nor
energy
for
this
kind
of
debate

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mr.
Casaubon
dip
his
pen
and
make
as
if
he
would
return
to
his
writing
,
though
his
hand
tremble
so
much
that
the
word
seem
to
be
write
in
an
unknown
character
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
answer
which
,
in
turn
away
wrath
,
only
send
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
to
have
a
discussion
coolly
waive
when
you
feel
that
justice
be
all
on
your
own
side
be
even
more
exasperating
in
marriage
than
in
philosophy
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
leave
Ladislaw
's
two
letter
unread
on
her
husband
's
writing
-
table
and
go
to
her
own
place
,
the
scorn
and
indignation
within
her
reject
the
reading
of
these
letter
,
just
as
we
hurl
away
any
trash
towards
which
we
seem
to
have
be
suspect
of
mean
cupidity
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
in
the
least
divine
the
subtle
source
of
her
husband
's
bad
temper
about
these
letter
<EOS>
:
she
only
know
that
they
have
cause
him
to
offend
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
to
work
at
once
,
and
her
hand
do
not
tremble
;
on
the
contrary
,
in
write
out
the
quotation
which
have
be
give
to
her
the
day
before
,
she
feel
that
she
be
form
her
letter
beautifully
,
and
it
seem
to
her
that
she
see
the
construction
of
the
Latin
she
be
copy
,
and
which
she
be
begin
to
understand
,
more
clearly
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
indignation
there
be
a
sense
of
superiority
,
but
it
go
out
for
the
present
in
firmness
of
stroke
,
and
do
not
compress
itself
into
an
inward
articulate
voice
pronounce
the
once
"
affable
archangel
"
a
poor
creature
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
this
apparent
quiet
for
half
an
hour
,
and
Dorothea
have
not
look
away
from
her
own
table
,
when
she
hear
the
loud
bang
of
a
book
on
the
floor
,
and
turn
quickly
see
Mr.
Casaubon
on
the
library
step
cling
forward
as
if
he
be
in
some
bodily
distress
.
 
<EOS>
She
start
up
and
bound
towards
him
in
an
instant
:
he
be
evidently
in
great
strait
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
jump
on
a
stool
<EOS>
she
get
close
to
his
elbow
and
say
with
her
whole
soul
melt
into
tender
alarm
    
<EOS>
"
Can
you
lean
on
me
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
for
two
or
three
minute
,
which
seem
endless
to
her
,
unable
to
speak
or
move
,
gasp
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
when
at
last
he
descend
the
three
step
and
fall
backward
in
the
large
chair
which
Dorothea
have
draw
close
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
,
he
no
longer
gasp
but
seem
helpless
and
about
to
faint
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
ring
the
bell
violently
,
and
presently
Mr.
Casaubon
be
help
to
the
couch
:
he
do
not
faint
,
and
be
gradually
revive
,
when
Sir
James
Chettam
come
in
,
have
be
meet
in
the
hall
with
the
news
that
Mr.
Casaubon
have
"
have
a
fit
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
this
be
just
what
may
have
be
expect
,
"
be
his
immediate
thought
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
prophetic
soul
have
be
urge
to
particularize
,
it
seem
to
him
that
"
fit
"
would
have
be
the
definite
expression
alight
upon
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
his
informant
,
the
butler
,
whether
the
doctor
have
be
send
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
butler
never
know
his
master
to
want
the
doctor
before
;
but
would
it
not
be
right
to
send
for
a
physician
?
  
<EOS>
when
Sir
James
enter
the
library
,
however
,
Mr.
Casaubon
could
make
some
sign
of
his
usual
politeness
,
and
Dorothea
,
who
in
the
reaction
from
her
first
terror
have
be
kneel
and
sob
by
his
side
now
rise
and
herself
propose
that
some
one
should
ride
off
for
a
medical
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
recommend
you
to
send
for
Lydgate
,
"
say
Sir
James
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
mother
have
call
him
in
,
and
she
have
find
him
uncommonly
clever
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
have
a
poor
opinion
of
the
physician
since
my
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
appeal
to
her
husband
,
and
he
make
a
silent
sign
of
approval
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Lydgate
be
send
for
and
he
come
wonderfully
soon
,
for
the
messenger
,
who
be
Sir
James
Chettam
's
man
and
know
Mr.
Lydgate
,
meet
him
lead
his
horse
along
the
Lowick
road
and
give
his
arm
to
Miss
Vincy
.
  
<EOS>
Celia
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
have
know
nothing
of
the
trouble
till
Sir
James
tell
her
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
Dorothea
's
account
,
he
no
longer
consider
the
illness
a
fit
,
but
still
something
"
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
Dodo
 
how
dreadful
!
"
say
Celia
,
feel
as
much
grieved
as
her
own
perfect
happiness
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
Her
little
hand
be
clasp
,
and
enclose
by
Sir
James
's
as
a
bud
be
enfold
by
a
liberal
calyx
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
shocking
that
Mr.
Casaubon
should
be
ill
;
but
I
never
do
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
be
not
half
fond
enough
of
Dorothea
;
and
he
ought
to
be
,
for
I
be
sure
no
one
else
would
have
have
him
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
they
would
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
think
it
a
horrible
sacrifice
of
your
sister
,
"
say
Sir
James
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
but
poor
Dodo
never
do
do
what
other
people
do
,
and
I
think
she
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
noble
creature
,
"
say
the
loyal
-
hearted
Sir
James
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
just
have
a
fresh
impression
of
this
kind
,
as
he
have
see
Dorothea
stretch
her
tender
arm
under
her
husband
's
neck
and
look
at
him
with
unspeakable
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
much
penitence
there
be
in
the
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Celia
,
think
it
be
very
well
for
Sir
James
to
say
so
,
but
_
he
_
would
not
have
be
comfortable
with
Dodo
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
Could
I
help
her
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
just
to
go
and
see
her
before
Lydgate
come
,
"
say
Sir
James
,
magnanimously
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
do
not
stay
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
Celia
be
go
he
walk
up
and
down
remember
what
he
have
originally
feel
about
Dorothea
's
engagement
,
and
feel
a
revival
of
his
disgust
at
Mr.
Brooke
's
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
if
Cadwallader
 
if
every
one
else
have
regard
the
affair
as
he
,
Sir
James
,
have
do
,
the
marriage
may
have
be
hinder
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wicked
to
let
a
young
girl
blindly
decide
her
fate
in
that
way
,
without
any
effort
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
James
have
long
cease
to
have
any
regret
on
his
own
account
:
his
heart
be
satisfied
with
his
engagement
to
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
chivalrous
nature
<EOS>
(
be
not
the
disinterested
service
of
woman
among
the
ideal
glory
of
old
chivalry
?
)
<EOS>
:
his
disregarded
love
have
not
turn
to
bitterness
;
its
death
have
make
sweet
odor
 
<EOS>
float
memory
that
cling
with
a
consecrate
effect
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
remain
her
brotherly
friend
,
interpret
her
action
with
generous
trustfulness
.

"

PASCAL

<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
have
no
second
attack
of
equal
severity
with
the
first
,
and
in
a
few
day
begin
to
recover
his
usual
condition
.
 
<EOS>
but
Lydgate
seem
to
think
the
case
worth
a
great
deal
of
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
not
only
use
his
stethoscope
(
which
have
not
become
a
matter
of
course
in
practice
at
that
time
)
,
but
sit
quietly
by
his
patient
and
watch
him
.
 
<EOS>
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
question
about
himself
,
he
reply
that
the
source
of
the
illness
be
the
common
error
of
intellectual
man
 
a
too
eager
and
monotonous
application
:
the
remedy
be
,
to
be
satisfied
with
moderate
work
,
and
to
seek
variety
of
relaxation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
sit
by
on
one
occasion
,
suggest
that
Mr.
Casaubon
should
go
fish
,
as
Cadwallader
do
,
and
have
a
turning
-
room
,
make
toy
,
table
-
leg
,
and
that
kind
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
you
recommend
me
to
anticipate
the
arrival
of
my
second
childhood
,
"
say
poor
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
some
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
thing
,
"
he
add
,
look
at
Lydgate
,
"
would
be
to
me
such
relaxation
as
tow
-
picking

be
to
prisoner

a
house
of
correction

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
smile
,
"
amusement
be
rather
an
unsatisfactory
prescription
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
something
like
tell
people
to
keep
up
their
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
better
say
,
that
you
must
submit
to
be
mildly
bored
rather
than
to
go
on
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
Mr.
Brooke
.
 
<EOS>
"
get
Dorothea
to
play
backgammon
with
you
in
the

now

not

your

why

I

I
have
go
through

new

"
  
<EOS>
"
as
new
as
eat
thistle

"
would
have
be
an
answer
to
represent
Mr.
Casaubon
's
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
only
bow
resignedly
,
with
due
respect
to
his
wife
's
uncle
,
and
observe
that
doubtless
the
work
he

You

say
the
able
magistrate
to
Lydgate
,
when
they
be
outside
the
door

"
Casaubon
have
be
a
little
narrow
:
it
leave
him
rather
at
a
loss
when
you
forbid
him
his
particular
work

which
I
believe
be
something
very
deep
indeed
 
in
the
line
of
research

you
know

I
would
never
give
way

that
;
I

always
versatile

a

He
would

more

more

I
recommend

to
talk

Mrs.

She

clever
enough
for
anything

be
my

<EOS>
tell

her

liveliness

diversion
:
put
her
on
amusing
tactic

"
  
<EOS>
without
Mr.
Brooke
's
advice
,
Lydgate
have
determine
on
speak
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
present
while
her
uncle
be
throw
out
his
pleasant
suggestion
as
to
the
mode
in
which
life
at
Lowick
may
be
enliven

but
she
be
usually
by
her

side

and
the
unaffected
sign
of
intense
anxiety
in
her
face

voice
about
whatever
touch

make
a
drama

to
himself
that
he
be

do
right

sometimes
in

easily
tempt
into
momentous
prophecy
which
life
and
death
easily
set
at
nought
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
often
be
satirical
on
this
gratuitous
prediction
,
and
he
mean
now
to
be
guard
.
  
<EOS>
He
ask
for
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
but
be
tell
that
she
be
out
walk
,
he
be
go
away
,
when
Dorothea
and
Celia
appear
,
both
glow
from
their
struggle
with
the
March
wind
.
 
<EOS>
when
Lydgate
beg
to
speak
with
her
alone
,
Dorothea
open
the
library
door
which
happen
to
be
the
near
,
think
of
nothing
at
the
moment
but
what
he
may
have
to
say
about
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
she
have
enter
this
room
since
her
husband
have
be
take
ill
,
and
the
servant
have
choose
not
to
open
the
shutter
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
light
enough
to
read
by
from
the
narrow
upper
pane
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
mind
this
sombre
light
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
since
you
forbid
book
,
the
library
have
be
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Casaubon
will
soon
be
here
again
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
be
he
not
make
progress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
much
more
rapid
progress
than
I
at
first
expect
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
already
nearly
in
his
usual
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
fear
that
the
illness
will
return
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
whose
quick
ear
have
detect
some
significance
in
Lydgate
's
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
case
be
peculiarly
difficult
to
pronounce
upon
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
"
the
only
point
on
which
I
can
be
confident
be
that
it
will
be
desirable
to
be
very
watchful
on
Mr.
Casaubon
's
account
,
lest
he
should
in
any
way
strain
his
nervous
power
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
to
speak
quite
plainly
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
in
an
imploring
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
there
may
be
something
which
I
do
not
know
,
and
which
,
if
I
have
know
it
,
would
have
make
me
act
differently
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
word
come
out
like
a
cry
:
it
be
evident
that
they
be
the
voice
of
some
mental
experience
which
lie
not
very
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
"
she
add
,
place
herself
on
the
near
chair
,
and
throw
off
her
bonnet
and
glove
,
with
an
instinctive
discarding
of
formality
where
a
great
question
of
destiny
be
concern
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
you
say
now
justify
my
own
view
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
one
's
function
as
a
medical
man
to
hinder
regret
of
that
sort
as
far
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
beg
you
to
observe
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
case
be
precisely
of
the
kind
in
which
the
issue
be
most
difficult
to
pronounce
upon
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
possibly
live
for
fifteen
year
or
more
,
without
much
bad
health
than
he
have
have
hitherto
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
turn
very
pale
,
and
when
Lydgate
pause
she
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
<EOS>
You
mean
if
we
be
very
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
careful
against
mental
agitation
of
all
kind
,
and
against
excessive
application
.
"
  
"
He
would
be
miserable
,
if
he
have
to
give
up
his
work
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
a
quick
prevision
of
that
wretchedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
aware
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
course
be
to
try
by
all
mean
,
direct
and
indirect
,
to
moderate
and
vary
his
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
happy
concurrence
of
circumstance
,
there
be
,
as
I
say
,
no
immediate
danger
from
that
affection
of
the
heart
,
which
I
believe
to
have
be
the
cause
of
his
late
attack
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
possible
that
the
disease
may
develop
itself
more
rapidly
:
it
be
one
of
those
ease
in
which
death
be
sometimes
sudden
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
should
be
neglect
which
may
be
affect
by
such
an
issue
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
silence
for
a
few
moment
,
while
Dorothea
sit
as
if
she
have
be
turn
to
marble
,
though
the
life
within
her
be
so
intense
that
her
mind
have
never
before
sweep
in
brief
time
over
an
equal
range
of
scene
and
motive
.
  
<EOS>
"
help
me
,
pray
,
"
she
say
,
at
last
,
in
the
same
low
voice
as
before
.
"
<EOS>
tell
me
what
I
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
foreign
travel
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
lately
in
Rome
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
memory
which
make
this
resource
utterly
hopeless
be
a
new
current
that
shake
Dorothea
out
of
her
pallid
immobility
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
would
not
do
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
bad
than
anything
,
"
she
say
with
a
more
childlike
despondency
,
while
the
tear
roll
down
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
will
be
of
any
use
that
he
do
not
enjoy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
that
I
could
have
spare
you
this
pain
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
deeply
touched
,
yet
wonder
about
her
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
woman
just
like
Dorothea
have
not
enter
into
his
tradition
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
right
of
you
to
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
understand
that
I
shall
not
say
anything
to
enlighten
Mr.
Casaubon
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
desirable
for
him
to
know
nothing
more
than
that
he
must
not
overwork
himself
,
and
must
observe
certain
rule
.
 
<EOS>
anxiety
of
any
kind
would
be
precisely
the
most
unfavorable
condition
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
rise
,
and
Dorothea
mechanically
rise
at
the
same
time
,
unclasp
her
cloak
and
throw
it
off
as
if
it
stifle
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bow
and
quit
her
,
when
an
impulse
which
if
she
have
be
alone
would
have
turn
into
a
prayer
,
make
her
say
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
    
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
a
wise
man
,
be
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
all
about
life
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
advise
me
.
 
<EOS>
think
what
I
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
labor
all
his
life
and
look
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
mind
about
nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
and
I
mind
about
nothing
else
 
"
  
<EOS>
for
year
after
Lydgate
remember
the
impression
produce
in
him
by
this
involuntary
appeal
 
this
cry
from
soul
to
soul
,
without
other
consciousness
than
their
move
with
kindred
nature
in
the
same
embroil
medium
,
the
same
troublous
fitfully
illuminate
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
could
he
say
now
except
that
he
should
see
Mr.
Casaubon
again
to
-
morrow
?
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Dorothea
's
tear
gush
forth
,
and
relieve
her
stifle
oppression
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
dry
her
eye
,
remind
that
her
distress
must
not
be
betray
to
her
husband
;
and
look
round
the
room
think
that
she
must
order
the
servant
to
attend
to
it
as
usual
,
since
Mr.
Casaubon
may
now
at
any
moment
wish
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
writing
-
table
there
be
letter
which
have
lie
untouched
since
the
morning
when
he
be
take
ill
,
and
among
them
,
as
Dorothea
well
remember
,
there
be
young
Ladislaw
's
letter
,
the
one
address
to
her
still
unopene
.
 
<EOS>
the
association
of
these
letter
have
be
make
the
more
painful
by
that
sudden
attack
of
illness
which
she
feel
that
the
agitation
cause
by
her
anger
may
have
help
to
bring
on
:
it
would
be
time
enough
to
read
them
when
they
be
again
thrust
upon
her
,
and
she
have
have
no
inclination
to
fetch
them
from
the
library
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
it
occur
to
her
that
they
should
be
put
out
of
her
husband
's
sight
:
whatever
may
have
be
the
source
of
his
annoyance
about
them
<EOS>
,
he
must
,
if
possible
,
not
be
annoy
again
;
and
she
run
her
eye
first
over
the
letter
address
to
him
to
assure
herself
whether
or
not
it
would
be
necessary
to
write
in
order
to
hinder
the
offensive
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Will
write
from
Rome
,
and
begin
by
say
that
his
obligation
to
Mr.
Casaubon
be
too
deep
for
all
thank
not
to
seem
impertinent
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
if
he
be
not
grateful
,
he
must
be
the
poorest
-
spirit
rascal
who
have
ever
find
a
generous
friend
.
 
<EOS>
to
expand
in
wordy
thank
would
be
like
say
,
"
I
be
honest
.
"
<EOS>
but
Will
have
come
to
perceive
that
his
defect
 
defect
which
Mr.
Casaubon
have
himself
often
point
to
 
need
for
their
correction
that
more
strenuous
position
which
his
relative
's
generosity
have
hitherto
prevent
from
be
inevitable
.
 
<EOS>
He
trust
that
he
should
make
the
good
return
,
if
return
be
possible
,
by
show
the
effectiveness
of
the
education
for
which
he
be
indebted
,
and
by
cease
in
future
to
need
any
diversion
towards
himself
of
fund
on
which
other
may
have
a
well
claim
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
come
to
England
,
to
try
his
fortune
,
as
many
other
young
man
be
oblige
to
do
whose
only
capital
be
in
their
brain
.
 
<EOS>
His
friend
Naumann
have
desire
him
to
take
charge
of
the
"
Dispute
"
 
the
picture
paint
for
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
whose
permission
,
and
Mrs.
Casaubon
's
,
Will
would
convey
it
to
Lowick
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
a
letter
address
to
the
Poste
Restante
in
Paris
within
the
fortnight
would
hinder
him
,
if
necessary
,
from
arrive
at
an
inconvenient
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
enclose
a
letter
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
in
which
he
continue
a
discussion
about
art
,
begin
with
her
in
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
open
her
own
letter
Dorothea
see
that
it
be
a
lively
continuation
of
his
remonstrance
with
her
fanatical
sympathy
and
her
want
of
sturdy
neutral
delight
in
thing
as
they
be
 
an
outpouring
of
his
young
vivacity
which
it
be
impossible
to
read
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
immediately
to
consider
what
be
to
be
do
about
the
other
letter
:
there
be
still
time
perhaps
to
prevent
Will
from
come
to
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
end
by
give
the
letter
to
her
uncle
,
who
be
still
in
the
house
,
and
beg
him
to
let
Will
know
that
Mr.
Casaubon
have
be
ill
,
and
that
his
health
would
not
allow
the
reception
of
any
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
more
ready
than
Mr.
Brooke
to
write
a
letter
<EOS>
:
his
only
difficulty
be
to
write
a
short
one
,
and
his
idea
in
this
case
expand
over
the
three
large
page
and
the
inward
folding
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
simply
say
to
Dorothea
    
"
to
be
sure
,
I
will
write
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
clever
young
fellow
 
<EOS>
this
young
Ladislaw
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
will
be
a
rise
young
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
letter
 
<EOS>
mark
his
sense
of
thing
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
tell
him
about
Casaubon
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
end
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
pen
be
a
thinking
organ
,
evolve
sentence
,
especially
of
a
benevolent
kind
,
<EOS>
before
the
rest
of
his
mind
could
well
overtake
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
express
regret
and
propose
remedy
,
which
,
when
Mr.
Brooke
read
them
,
seem
felicitously
word
 
surprisingly
the
right
thing
,
and
determine
a
sequel
which
he
have
never
before
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
his
pen
find
it
such
a
pity
young
Ladislaw
should
not
have
come
into
the
neighborhood
just
at
that
time
,
<EOS>
in
order
that
Mr.
Brooke
may
make
his
acquaintance
more
fully
,
and
that
they
may
go
over
the
long
-
neglect
italian
drawing
together
 
it
also
feel
such
an
interest
in
a
young
man
who
be
start
in
life
with
a
stock
of
idea
 
that
by
the
end
of
the
second
page
it
have
persuade
Mr.
Brooke
to
invite
young
Ladislaw
,
since
he
could
not
be
receive
at
Lowick
,
to
come
to
Tipton
Grange
.
 
<EOS>
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
They
could
find
a
great
many
thing
to
do
together
,
and
this
be
a
period
of
peculiar
growth
 
the
political
horizon
be
expand
,
and
 
in
short
,
Mr.
Brooke
's
pen
go
off
into
a
little
speech
which
it
have
lately
report
for
that
imperfectly
edit
organ
the
"
Middlemarch
Pioneer
.
<EOS>
"
while
Mr.
Brooke
be
seal
this
letter
,
he
feel
elated
with
an
influx
of
dim
project
:
 
a
young
man
capable
of
put
idea
into
form
,
the
"
Pioneer
"
purchase
to
clear
the
pathway
for
a
new
candidate
,
document
utilize
 
who
know
what
may
come
of
it
all
?
 
<EOS>
since
Celia
be
go
to
marry
immediately
,
it
would
be
very
pleasant
to
have
a
young
fellow
at
table
with
him
,
at
least
for
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
go
away
without
tell
Dorothea
what
he
have
put
into
the
letter
,
for
she
be
engage
with
her
husband
,
and
 
in
fact
,
these
thing
be
of
no
importance
to
her
.
        
<EOS>
how
will
you
know
the
pitch
of
that
great
bell
    
too
large
for
you
to
stir
?
 
<EOS>
let
but
a
flute
    
Play
'
neath
<EOS>
the
fine

mixed
metal
listen
close
    
<EOS>
till
the

note
flow
forth
,
a
silvery
rill
.
    
<EOS>
then
shall
the
huge
bell
tremble
 
then
the
mass
    
with
myriad
wave
concurrent
shall
respond
    
in
low
soft
unison
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
that
evening
speak
to
Miss
Vincy
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
lay
some
emphasis
on
the
strong
feeling
she
appear
to
have
for
that
formal
studious
man
thirty
year
old
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
be
devoted
to
her
husband
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
imply
a
notion
of
necessary
sequence
which
the
scientific
man
regard
as
the
pretty
possible
for
a
woman
;
but
she
be
think
at
the
same
time
that
it
be
not
so
very
melancholy
to
be
mistress
of
Lowick
Manor
with
a
husband
likely
to
die
soon
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
her
very
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
certainly
be
handsome
,
but
I
have
not
think
about
it
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
  
<EOS>
"

suppose
it

how
your
practice

spread

You

I
do
not
really
like

such
people
so
well

the
poor

<EOS>
the
case
be
more
monotonous
,

one
have
to
go
through
more
fuss

listen
more
deferentially
to
nonsense
.
"
  
"
not
more
than
in
Middlemarch
,
"
say
Rosamond

<EOS>
"
and
at

you
go
through
wide
corridor

have
the

leave
everywhere

<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
Mademoiselle

Lydgate

just
bend
his

lift
with
his
fourth

delicate

lie
at

reticule

as
if
to
enjoy
its

look

this

Lydgate

It
be
not

to
find

whatever
Miss

she
be
perhaps
the
more

after

have
go

perhaps
even
stare
a
little
in
return

on
the

a

"

oh
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
you

well
what
your
advantage

<EOS>
You
know
that
our
young
man
here
can
not
cope
with
you

<EOS>
where
you
frequent
a
house
it
may
militate
very
much
against
a

make
a
desirable

prevent
her
from

"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
be
less
flatter
by
his
advantage
over
the
Middlemarch
Orlandos
than
he
be
annoy
by
the
perception
of
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
speak
as
impressively
as
it
be
necessary
to
do
,
and
that
in
use
the
superior
word
"
militate
"
she
have
throw
a
noble
drapery
over
a
mass
of
particular
which
be
still
evident
enough
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
be
fume
a
little
,
push
his
hair
back
with
one
hand
,
feel
curiously
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
with
the
other
,
and
then
stoop
to
beckon
the
tiny
black
spaniel
,
which
have
the
insight
to
decline
his
hollow
caress
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
be
decent
to
go
away
,
because
he
have
be
dine
with
other
guest
,
and
have
just
take
tea
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
have
no
doubt
that
she
have
be
understand
,
turn
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Solomon

Proverbs

I

have
omit

that
as
the
sore

findeth

so
an
uneasy

heareth
innuendo
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
Mr.
Farebrother
,
part
from
Lydgate
in
the
street
,
suppose
that
they
should
meet
at
Vincy
be
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
answer
curtly
,
no
 
he
have
work
to
do
 
he
must
give
up
go
out
in
the
evening

say
the

<EOS>
"
well

if

you

"
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
before
,
Lydgate
would
have
take
no
notice
of
these
word
as
anything
more
than
the
Vicar
's
usual
way
of
put
thing
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
now
to
convey
an
innuendo
which
confirm
the
impression
that
he
have
be
make
a
fool
of
himself
and
behave
so
as
to
be
misunderstood
:
not
,
he
believe
,
by
Rosamond
herself
;
she
,
he
feel
sure
,
take
everything
as
lightly
as
he
intend
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
an
exquisite
tact
and
insight
in
relation
to
all
point
of
manner
;
but
the
people
she
live
among
be
blunderer
and
busybody
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
mistake
should
go
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolve
 
and
keep
his
resolution
 
that
he
would
not
go
to
Mr.
Vincy
be
except
on
business
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
become
very
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
the
uneasiness
first
stir
by
her
aunt
's
question
grow
and
grow
till
at
the
end
of
ten
day
that
she
have
not
see
Lydgate
,
it
grow
into
terror
at
the
blank
that
may
possibly
come
 
into
foreboding
of
that
ready
,
fatal
sponge
which
so
cheaply
wipe
out
the
hope
of
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
would
have
a
new
dreariness
for
her
,
as
a
wilderness
that
a
magician
's
spell
have
turn
for
a
little
while
into
a
garden
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
be
begin
to
know
the
pang
of
disappointed
love
,
and
that
no
other
man
could
be
the
occasion
of
such
delightful
aerial
building
as
she
have
be
enjoy
for
the
last
six
month
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Rosamond
lose
her
appetite
and
feel
as
forlorn
as
Ariadne
 
as
a
charming
stage
Ariadne
leave
behind
with
all
her
box
full
of
costume
and
no
hope
of
a
coach
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
wonderful
mixture
in
the
world
which
be
all
alike
call
love
,
and
claim
the
privilege
of
a
sublime
rage
which
be
an
apology
for
everything
(
in
literature
and
the
drama
)
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
Rosamond
do
not
think
of
commit
any
desperate
act
:
she
plait
her
fair
hair
as
beautifully
as
usual
,
and
keep
herself
proudly
calm
.
 
<EOS>
Her
most
cheerful
supposition
be
that
her
aunt
Bulstrode
have
interfere
in
some
way
to
hinder
Lydgate
's
visit
:
everything
be
well
than
a
spontaneous
indifference
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
any
one
who
imagine
ten
day
too
short
a
time
 
not
for
fall
into
leanness
,
lightness
,
or
other
measurable
effect
of
passion
,
but
 
for
the
whole
spiritual
circuit
of
alarmed
conjecture
and
disappointment
,
be
ignorant
of
what
can
go
on
in
the
elegant
leisure
of
a
young
lady
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
eleventh
day
,
however
,
Lydgate
when
leave
Stone
Court
be
request
by
Mrs.
Vincy
to
let
her
husband
know
that
there
be
a
marked
change
in
Mr.
Featherstone
's
health
,
and
that
she
wish
him
to
come
to
Stone
Court
on
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
now
Lydgate
may
have
call
at
the
warehouse
,
or
may
have
write
a
message
on
a
leaf
of
his
pocket
-
book
and
leave
it
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
yet
these
simple
device
apparently
do
not
occur
to
him
,
from
which
we
may
conclude
that
he
have
no
strong
objection
to
call
at
the
house
at
an
hour
when
Mr.
Vincy
be
not
at
home
,
and
leave
the
message
with
Miss
Vincy
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
may
,
from
various
motive
,
decline
to
give
his
company
,
but
perhaps
not
even
a
sage
would
be
gratify
that
nobody
miss
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
graceful
,
easy
way
of
piece
on
the
new
habit
to
the
old
,
to
have
a
few
playful
word
with
Rosamond
about
his
resistance
to
dissipation
,
and
his
firm
resolve
to
take
long
fast
even
from
sweet
sound
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
,
also
,
that
momentary
speculation
as
to
all
the
possible
ground
for
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
hint
have
manage
to
get
weave
like
slight
cling
hair
into
the
more
substantial
web
of
his
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Vincy
be
alone
,
and
blush
so
deeply
when
Lydgate
come
in
that
he
feel
a
corresponding
embarrassment
,
and
instead
of
any
playfulness
,
he
begin
at
once
to
speak
of
his
reason
for
calling
,
and
to
beg
her
,
almost
formally
,
to
deliver
the
message
to
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
who
at
the
first
moment
feel
as
if
her
happiness
be
return
,
be
keenly
hurt
by
Lydgate
's
manner
;
her
blush
have
depart
,
and
she
assent
coldly
,
without
add
an
unnecessary
word
,
some
trivial
chain
-
work
which
she
have
in
her
hand
enable
her
to
avoid
look
at
lydgate
high
than
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
failure
,
the
beginning
be
certainly
the
half
of
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
after
sit
two
long
moment
while
he
move
his
whip
and
could
say
nothing
,
Lydgate
rise
to
go
,
and
Rosamond
,
make
nervous
by
her
struggle
between
mortification
and
the
wish
not
to
betray
it
,
drop
her
chain
as
if
startle
,
and
rise
too
,
mechanically
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
instantaneously
stoop
to
pick
up
the
chain
.
<EOS>
when
he
rise
he
be
very
near
to
a
lovely
little
face
set
on
a
fair
long
neck
which
he
have
be
use
to
see
turn
about
under
the
most
perfect
management
of
self
-
content
grace
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
raise
his
eye
now
he
see
a
certain
helpless
quivering
which
touch
him
quite
newly
,
and
make
him
look
at
Rosamond
with
a
questioning
flash
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
she
be
as
natural
as
she
have
ever
be
when
she
be
five
year
old
:
she
feel
that
her
tear
have
rise
,
and
it
be
no
use
to
try
to
do
anything
else
than
let
them
stay
like
water
on
a
blue
flower
or
let
them
fall
over
her
cheek
,
even
as
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
that
moment
of
naturalness
be
the
crystallizing
feather
-
touch
:
it
shake
flirtation
into
love
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
the
ambitious
man
who
be
look
at
those
forget
-
me
-
not
under
the
water
be
very
warm
-
hearted
and
rash
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
where
the
chain
go
;
an
idea
have
thrill
through
the
recess
within
him
which
have
a
miraculous
effect
in
raise
the
power
of
passionate
love
lie
bury
there
in
no
seal
sepulchre
,
but
under
the
light
,
easily
pierce
mould
.
 
<EOS>
His
word
be
quite
abrupt
and
awkward
;
but
the
tone
make
them
sound
like
an
ardent
,
appeal
avowal
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
you
be
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
pray
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
never
be
speak
to
in
such
tone
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
she
know
what
the
word
be
:
but
she
look
at
Lydgate
and
the
tear
fall
over
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
there
could
have
be
no
more
complete
answer
than
that
silence
,
and
Lydgate
,
forget
everything
else
,
completely
master
by
the
outrush
of
tenderness
at
the
sudden
belief
that
this
sweet
young
creature
depend
on
him
for
her
joy
,
actually
put
his
arm
round
her
,
fold
her
gently
<EOS>
and
protectingly
 
he
be
use
to
be
gentle
with
the
weak
and
suffer
 
and
kiss
each
of
the
two
large
tear
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
strange
way
of
arrive
at
an
understanding
,
but
it
be
a
short
way
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
not
angry
,
but
she
move
backward
a
little
in
timid
happiness
,
and
Lydgate
could
now
sit
near
her
and
speak
less
incompletely
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
to
make
her
little
confession
,
and
he
pour
out
word
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
with
impulsive
lavishment
.
 
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
he
leave
the
house
an
engaged
man
,
whose
soul
be
not
his
own
,
but
the
woman
's
to
whom
he
have
bind
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
again
in
the
evening
to
speak
with
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
,
just
return
from
Stone
Court
,
be
feel
sure
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
hear
of
Mr.
Featherstone
's
demise
.
 
<EOS>
the
felicitous
word
"
demise
,
"
which
have
seasonably
occur
to
him
,
have
raise
his
spirit
even
above
their
usual
evening
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
the
right
word
be
always
a
power
,
and
communicate
its
definiteness
to
our
action
.
 
<EOS>
consider
as
a
demise
,
old
Featherstone
's
death
assume
a
merely
legal
aspect
,
so
that
Mr.
Vincy
could
tap
his
snuff
-
box
over
it
and
be
jovial
,
without
even
an
intermittent
affectation
of
solemnity
;
and
Mr.
Vincy
hate
both
solemnity
and
affectation
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
ever
awe
strike
about
a
testator
,
or
sing
a
hymn
on
the
title
to
real
property
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
be
incline
to
take
a
jovial
view
of
all
thing
that
evening
:
he
even
observe
to
Lydgate
that
Fred
have
get
the
family
constitution
after
all
,
and
would
soon
be
as
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
again
;
and
when
his
approbation
of
Rosamond
's
engagement
be
ask
for
,
he
give
it
with
astonishing
facility
,
pass
at
once
to
general
remark
on
the
desirableness
of
matrimony
for
young
man
and
maiden
,
and
apparently
deduce
from
the
whole
the
appropriateness
of
a
little
more
punch
.

They

SHAKESPEARE
:
temp

<EOS>
the
triumphant
confidence
of
the
Mayor
found
on
Mr.
Featherstone
's
insistent
demand
that
Fred
and
his
mother
should
not
leave
him
,
be
a
feeble
emotion
compare
with
all
that
be
agitate
the
breast
of
the
old
man
's
blood
-
relation
,
who
naturally
manifest
more
their
sense
of
the
family
tie
and
be
more
visibly
numerous
now
that
he
have
become
bedridden
.
 
<EOS>
naturally
:
for
when
"
poor
Peter
"
have
occupy
his
arm
-
chair
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
,
no
assiduous
beetle
for
whom
the
cook
prepare
boiling
water
could
have
be
less
welcome
on
a
hearth
which
they
have
reason
for
prefer
,
than
those
person
whose
Featherstone
blood
be
ill
-
nourished
,
not
from
penuriousness
on
their
part
,
but
from
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
Solomon
and
Sister
Jane
be
rich
,
and
the
family
candor
and
total
abstinence
from
false
politeness
with
which
they
be
always
receive
seem
to
them
no
argument
that
their
brother
in
the
solemn
act
of
make
his
will
would
overlook
the
superior
claim
of
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
Themselves
at
least
he
have
never
be
unnatural
enough
to
banish
from
his
house
,
and
it
seem
hardly
eccentric
that
he
should
have
keep
away
Brother
Jonah
,
Sister
Martha
,
and
the
rest
,
who
have
no
shadow
of
such
claim
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
Peter
's
maxim
,
<EOS>
that
money
be
a
good
egg
,
and
should
be
lay
in
a
warm
nest
.
  
<EOS>
but
Brother
Jonah
,
Sister
Martha
,
and
all
the
needy
exile
,
hold
a
different
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
probability
be
as
various
as
the
face
to
be
see
at

in
fretwork
or
paper
-
hanging
:
every
form
be
there
,
from
Jupiter
to
Judy
,
if
you
only
look
with
creative
inclination

<EOS>
to
the
poor
and
least
favor
it
seem
likely
that
since
Peter
have
do
nothing
for
them
in
his
life
,
he
would
remember
them
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
Jonah
argue
that
man
like
to
make
a
surprise
of
their
will
,
while
Martha
say
that
nobody
nee
be
surprised
if
he
leave
the
good
part
of
his
money
to
those
who
least
expect
it
.
 
<EOS>
also
it
be
not
to
be
think
but
that
an
own
brother
"
lie
there
"
with
dropsy
in
his
leg
<EOS>
must
come
to
feel
that
blood
be
thick
than
water
,
and
if
he
do
not
alter
his
will
,
he
may
have
money
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
some
blood

relation
should
be
on
the
premise
and
on
the
watch
against
those
who
be
hardly
relation
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
such
thing
have
be
know
as
forge
will
and
dispute
will
,
which
seem
to
have
the
golden

hazy
advantage
of
somehow
enable
non

live
out
of
them

<EOS>
again
,
those
who
be
no
blood

relation
may
be
catch
make
away
with
thing
 
and
poor
Peter
"
lie
there
"
helpless
!
 
<EOS>
somebody
should
be
on
the
watch
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
conclusion
they
be
at
one
with
Solomon
and
Jane
;
also
,
some
nephew
,
niece
,
and
cousin
,
argue
with
still
great
subtilty
as
to
what
may
be
do
by
a
man
able
to
"
will
away
"
his
property
and
give
himself
large
treat
of
oddity
,
feel
in
a
handsome
sort
of
way
that
there
be
a
family
interest
to
be
attend
to
,
and
thought
of
Stone
Court
as
a
place
which
it
would
be
nothing
but
<EOS>
right
for
them
to
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Sister
Martha
,
otherwise
Mrs.
Cranch
,
live
with
some
wheeziness
in
the
Chalky
Flats
,
could
not
undertake
the
journey
;
but
her
son
,
as
be
poor
Peter
's
own
nephew
,
could
represent
her
advantageously
,
and
watch
lest
his
uncle
Jonah
should
make
an
unfair
use
of
the
improbable
thing
which
seem
likely
to
happen
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
there
be
a
general
sense
run
in
the
Featherstone
blood
that
everybody
must
watch
everybody
else
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
everybody
else
to
reflect
that
the
Almighty
be
watch
him
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Stone
Court
continually
see
one
or
other
blood
-
relation
alighting
or
departing
,
and
Mary
Garth
have
the
unpleasant
task
of
carry
their
message
to
Mr.
Featherstone
,
who
would
see
none
of
them
,
and
send
her
down
with
the
still
more
unpleasant
task
of
tell
them
so
.
 
<EOS>
as
manager
of
the
household
she
feel
bind
to
ask
them
in
good
provincial
fashion
to
stay
and
eat
;
but
she
choose
to
consult
Mrs.
Vincy
on
the
point
of
extra
down
-
stair
consumption
now
that
Mr.
Featherstone
be
lay
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
you
must
do
thing
handsomely
where
there
be
last
illness
and
a
property
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
,
I
do
not
grudge
them
every
ham
in
the
house
 
only
,
save
the
good
for
the
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
have
some
stuff
veal
always
,
and
a
fine
cheese
in
cut
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
expect
to
keep
open
house
in
these
last
illness
,
"
say
liberal
Mrs.
Vincy
,
once
more
of
cheerful
note
and
bright
plumage
.
  
<EOS>
but
some
of
the
visitor
alight
and
do
not
depart
after
the
handsome
treat
to
veal
and
ham
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
Jonah
,
for
example
(
there
be
such
unpleasant
people
in
most
family
;
perhaps
even
in
the
high
aristocracy
there
be
Brobdingnag
specimen
,
gigantically
in
debt
and
bloated
at
great
expense
)
 
<EOS>
Brother
Jonah
,
I
say
,
have
come
down
in
the
world
,
be
mainly
support
by
a
calling
which
he
be
modest
enough
not
to
boast
of
,
though
it
be
much
well
than
swindle
either
on
exchange
or
turf
,
but
which
do
not
require
his
presence
at
brasse
so
long
as
he
have
a
good
corner
to
sit
in
and
a
supply
of
food
.
 
<EOS>
He
choose
the
kitchen
-
corner
,
partly
because
he
like
it
best
,
and
partly
because
he
do
not
want
to
sit
with
Solomon
,
<EOS>
concern
whom
he
have
a
strong
brotherly
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
seat
in
a
famous
arm
-
chair
and
in
his
good
suit
,
constantly
within
sight
of
good
cheer
,
he
have
a
comfortable
consciousness
of
be
on
the
premise
,
mingle
with
fleeting
suggestion
of
Sunday
and
the
bar
at
the
Green
Man
;
and
he
inform
Mary
Garth
that
he
should
not
go
out
of
reach
of
his
brother
Peter
while
that
poor
fellow
be
above
ground
.
 
<EOS>
the
troublesome
one
in
a
family
be
usually
either
the
wit
or
the
idiot
.
 
<EOS>
Jonah
be
the
wit
among
the
Featherstones
,
and
joke
with
the
maid
-
servant
when
they
come
about
the
hearth
,
but
seem
to
consider
Miss
Garth
a
suspicious
character
,
and
follow
her
with
cold
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
would
have
bear
this
one
pair
of
eye
with
comparative
ease
,
but
unfortunately
there
be
young
Cranch
,
who
,
have
come
all
the
way
from
the
Chalky
Flats
to
represent
his
mother
and
watch
his
uncle
Jonah
,
also
feel
it
his
duty
to
stay
and
to
sit
chiefly
in
the
kitchen
to
give
his
uncle
company
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Cranch
be
not
exactly
the
balancing
point
between
the
wit
and
the
idiot
,
 
verge
slightly
towards
the
latter
type
,
and
squint
so
as
to
leave
everything
in
doubt
about
his
sentiment
except
that
they
be
not
of
a
forcible
character
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mary
Garth
enter
the
kitchen
and
Mr.
Jonah
Featherstone
begin
to
follow
her
with
his
cold
detective
eye
,
young
Cranch
turn
his
head
in
the
same
direction
seem
to
insist
on
it
that
she
should
remark
how
he
be
squint
,
as
if
he
do
it
with
design
,
like
the
gypsy
when
Borrow
read
the
New
Testament
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
rather
too
much
for
poor
Mary
;
sometimes
it
make
her
bilious
,
sometimes
it
upset
her
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
that
she
have
an
opportunity
she
could
not
resist
describe
the
kitchen
scene
to
Fred
,
who
would
not
be
hinder
from
immediately
go
to
see
it
,
affect
simply
to
pass
through
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
he
face
the
four
eye
than
he
have
to
rush
through
the
near
door
which
happen
to
lead
to
the
dairy
,
and
there
under
the
high
roof
and
among
the
pan
he
give
way
to
laughter
which
make
a
hollow
resonance
perfectly
audible
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
He
flee
by
another
doorway
,
but
Mr.
Jonah
,
who
have
not
before
see
Fred
's
white
complexion
,
long
leg
,
and
pinch
delicacy
of
face
,
prepare
many
sarcasm
in
which
these
point
of
appearance
be
wittily
combine
with
the
low
moral
attribute
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Tom
,
_
you
_
do
not
wear
such
gentlemanly
trouser
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
get
half
such
fine
long
leg
,
"
say
Jonah
to
his
nephew
,
wink
at
the
same
time
,
to
imply
that
there
be
something
more
in
these
statement
than
their
undeniableness
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
look
at
his
leg
,
but
leave
it
uncertain
whether
he
prefer
his
moral
advantage
to
a
more
vicious
length
of
limb
and
reprehensible
gentility
of
trouser
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
large
wainscoted
parlor
too
there
be
constantly
pair
of
eye
on
the
watch
,
and
own

eager
to

sitter

up

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
many
come

lunch
,
and
depart

but
Brother
Solomon
and
the
lady
who
have
be
Jane
Featherstone
for
twenty
-
five
year
before
she
be
Mrs.
Waule
find
it
good
to
be
there
every
day
for
hour
,
without
other
calculable
occupation
than
that
of
observe
the
cunning
Mary
Garth
(
who
be
so
deep
that
she
could
be
find
out
in
nothing
)
and
give
occasional
dry
wrinkly
indication
of
cry
 
as
if
capable
of
torrent
in
a
wetter
season
 
at
the
thought
that
they
be
not
allow
to
go
into
Mr.
Featherstone
's
room

for
the
old
man
's
dislike
of
his

to
get
strong
as
he
get
less
able
to
amuse
himself
by

bite
thing
to
them

<EOS>
too
languid
to
ste

he
have
the
more
venom
refluent
in
his
blood

<EOS>
not
fully
believe
the
message
send
through
Mary
Garth
,
they
have
present
themselves
together
within
the
door
of
the
bedroom
,
both
in
black
 
Mrs.
Waule
have
a
white
handkerchief
partially
unfold
in
her
hand
 
and
both
with
face
in
a
sort
of
half

mourn
purple
;
while
Mrs.
Vincy
with
her
pink
cheek
and
pink
ribbon
fly
be
actually
administer
a
cordial
to
their
own
brother
,
and
the
light

complexioned
Fred
,
his
short
hair
curl
as
may
be
expect
in

loll

Old

these
funereal
figure
appear
in

his
order

rage
come
to
strengthen
him
more
successfully
than
the
cordial

<EOS>
He
be
prop
up
on

rest

always
have
his
gold

He
seize
it
now

sweep
it
backwards

forwards
in
as
large
an
area
as
he
could

apparently
to
ban
these
ugly

cry
in
a
hoarse

of
screech

Mrs.

Solomon
put
his

before

repressingly

<EOS>
He
be
a
large

cheek
man
,
nearly
seventy
,
with
small
furtive
eye
,
and
be
not
only
of
much
blander
temper
but
think
himself
much
deeper
than
his
brother
Peter
;
indeed
not
likely
to
be
deceive
in
any
of
his
fellow
-
man
,
inasmuch
as
they
could
not
well
be
more
greedy

deceitful
than
he
suspect
them
of
be

<EOS>
even
the
invisible
power

he

,
be
likely

be
soothe
by
a
bland
parenthesis

come
from

none

sometimes
carry

a

dialogue
in
an
undertone
in
which
the
observation

response
be
so
far
apart

that
any
one
hear
them
may
have
imagine
himself
listen
to
speak
automata

in
some
doubt
whether
the
ingenious

really
work

wind
itself
up

silent

Solomon

what

now
that

his

could
be

with
all

some

express
much
agreement

sympathy
with

disappoint
in
time
past
by
codicil
and
marriage
for
spite
on
the
part
of
ungrateful
elderly
gentleman
,
who
,
it
may
have
be
suppose
,
have
be
spare
for
something
well
.
 
<EOS>
such
conversation
pause
suddenly
,
like
an
organ
when
the
bellow
be
let
drop
,
if
Mary
Garth
come
into
the
room
;
and
all
eye
be
turn
on
her
as
a
possible
legatee
,
or
one
who
may
get
access
to
iron
chest
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
young
man
who
be
relative
or
connection
of
the
family
,
be
dispose
to
admire
her
in
this
problematic
light
,
as
a
girl
who
show
much
conduct
,
and
who
among
all
the
chance
that
be
fly
may
turn
out
to
be
at
least
a
moderate
prize
.
 
<EOS>
hence
she
have
her
share
of
compliment
and
polite
attention
.
  
<EOS>
especially
from
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
a
distinguished
bachelor
and
auctioneer
of
those
part
,
much
concerned
in
the
sale
of
land
and
cattle
:
a
public
character
,
indeed
,
whose
name
be
see
on
widely
distribute
placard
,
and
who
may
reasonably
be
sorry
for
those
who
do
not
know
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
second
cousin
to
Peter
Featherstone
,
and
have
be
treat
by
him
with
more
amenity
than
any
other
relative
,
be
useful
in
matter
of
business
;
and
in
that
programme
of
his
funeral
which
the
old
man
have
himself
dictate
,
he
have
be
name
as
a
Bearer
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
odious
cupidity
in
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
 
nothing
more
than
a
sincere
sense
of
his
own
merit
,
which
,
he
be
aware
,
<EOS>
in
case
of
rivalry
may
tell
against
competitor
;
so
that
if
Peter
Featherstone
,
who
so
far
as
he
,
Trumbull
,
be
concern
,
have
behave
like
as
good
a
soul
as
ever
breathe
,
should
have
do
anything
handsome
by
him
,
all
he
could
say
be
,
that
he
have
never
fish
and
fawn
,
but
have
advise
him
to
the
good
of
his
experience
,
which
now
extend
over
twenty
year
from
the
time
of
his
apprenticeship
at
fifteen
,
and
be
likely
to
yield
a
knowledge
of
no
surreptitious
kind
.
<EOS>
His
admiration
be
far
from
be
confine
to
himself
,
but
be
accustom
professionally
as
well
as
privately
to
delight
in
estimate
thing
at
a
high
rate
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
amateur
of
superior
phrase
,
and
never
use
poor
language
without
immediately
correct
himself
 
which
be
fortunate
,
as
he
be
rather
loud
,
and
give
to
predominate
,
stand
or
walk
about
frequently
,
pull
down
his
waistcoat
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
be
very
much
of
his
own
opinion
,
trim
himself
rapidly
with
his
fore
-
finger
,
and
mark
each
new
series
in
these
movement
by
a
busy
play
with
his
large
seal
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
occasionally
a
little
fierceness
in
his
demeanor
,
but
it
be
direct
chiefly
against
false
opinion
,
of
which
there
be
so
much
to
correct
in
the
world
that
a
man
of
some
reading
and
experience
necessarily
have
his
patience
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
the
Featherstone
family
generally
be
of
limited
understanding
,
but
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
public
character
,
take
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
even
go
to
converse
with
Mr.
Jonah
and
young
Cranch
in
the
kitchen
,
not
doubt
that
he
have
impress
the
latter
greatly
by
his
lead
question
concern
the
Chalky
Flats
.
 
<EOS>
if
anybody
have
observe
that
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
be
an
auctioneer
,
be
bind
to
know
the
nature
of
everything
,
he
would
have
smile
and
trim
himself
silently
with
the
sense
that
he
come
pretty
near
that
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
in
an
auctioneering
way
,
he
be
an
honorable
man
,
not
ashamed
of
his

,
and
feel
that

not
fail
to
recognize

He
now
walk
to

<EOS>
"
 
then
turn

sonorously

He

truly
admirable

not

feel

enhance
the
sonorous
beauty

Mr.

it

some

<EOS>
She
often
choose
this
task
,
in
which
she
find
some
pleasure
,
notwithstanding
the
old
man
's
testiness
whenever
he
demand
her
attention
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
interval
in
which
she
could
sit
perfectly
still
,
enjoy
the
outer
stillness
and
the
subdued
light
.
 
<EOS>
the
red
fire
with
its
gently
audible
movement
seem
like
a
solemn
existence
calmly
independent
of
the
petty
passion
,
the
imbecile
desire
,
the
straining
after
worthless
uncertainty
,
which
be
daily
move
her
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
fond
of
her
own
thought
,
and
could
amuse
herself
well
sit
in
twilight
with
her
hand
in
her
lap
;
for
,
have
early
have
strong
reason
to
believe
that
thing
be
not
likely
to
be
arrange
for
her
peculiar
satisfaction
,
she
waste
no
time
in
astonishment
and
annoyance
at
that
fact
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
already
come
to
take
life
very
much
as
a
comedy
in
which
she
have
a
proud
,
nay
,
a
generous
resolution
not
to
act
the
mean
or
treacherous
part
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
may
have
become
cynical
if
she
have
not
have
parent
whom
she
honor
,
and
a
well
of
affectionate
gratitude
within
her
,
which
be
all
the
full
because
she
have
learn
to
make
no
unreasonable
claim
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
to
-
night
revolving
,
as
she
be
will
not
,
the
scene
of
the
day
,
her
lip
often
curl
with
amusement
at
the
oddity
to
which
her
fancy
add
fresh
drollery
:
people
be
so
ridiculous
with
their
illusion
,
carry
their
fool
's
cap
unaware
,
think
their
own
lie
opaque
while
everybody
else
's
be
transparent
,
make
themselves
exception
to
everything
,
as
if
when
all
the
world
look
yellow
under
a
lamp
they
alone
be
rosy
.
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
some
illusion
under
Mary
's
eye
which
be
not
quite
comic
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
secretly
convince
,
though
she
have
no
other
ground
than
her
close
observation
of
old
Featherstone
's
nature
,
that
in
spite
of
his
fondness
for
have
the
Vincys
about
him
,
they
be
as
likely
to
be
disappoint
as
any
of
the
relation
whom
he
keep
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
good
deal
of
disdain
for
Mrs.
Vincy
's
evident
alarm
lest
she
and
Fred
should
be
alone
together
,
but
it
do
not
hinder
her
from
think
anxiously
of
the
way
in
which
Fred
would
be
affect
,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
his
uncle
have
leave
him
as
poor
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
make
a
butt
of
Fred
when
he
be
present
,
but
she
do
not
enjoy
his
folly
when
he
be
absent
.
  
<EOS>
yet
she
like
her
thought
:
<EOS>
a
vigorous
young
mind
not
overbalance
by
passion
,
find
a
good
in
make
acquaintance
with
life
,
and
watch
its
own
power
with
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
have
plenty
of
merriment
within
.
  
<EOS>
Her
thought
be
not
vein
by
any
solemnity
or
pathos
about
the
old
man
on
the
bed
:
such
sentiment
be
easy
to
affect
than
to
feel
about
an
aged
creature
whose
life
be
not
visibly
anything
but
a
remnant
of
vice
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
always
see
the
most
disagreeable
side
of
Mr.
Featherstone
:
he
be
not
proud
of
her
,
and
she
be
only
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
be
anxious
about
a
soul
that
be
always
snap
at
you
must
be
leave
to
the
saint
of
the
earth
;
and
Mary
be
not
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
never
return
him
a
harsh
word
,
and
have
wait
on
him
faithfully
:
that
be
her
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Featherstone
himself
be
not
in
the
least
anxious
about
his
soul
,
and
have
decline
to
see
Mr.
Tucker
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
to
-
night
he
have
not
snap
,
and
for
the
first
hour
or
two
he
lie
remarkably
still
,
until
at
last
Mary
hear
him
rattle
his
bunch
of
key
against
the
tin
box
which
he
always
keep
in
the
bed
beside
him
.
<EOS>
about
three
o'clock
he
say
,
with
remarkable
distinctness
,
"
Missy
,
come
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
obey
,
and
find
that
he
have
already
draw
the
tin
box
from
under
the
clothe
,
though
he
usually
ask
to
have
this
do
for
him
;
and
he
have
select
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
unlock
the
box
,
and
,
draw
from
it
another
key
,
look
straight
at
her
with
eye
that
seem
to
have
recover
all
their
sharpness
and
say
,
"
how
many
of
'em
be
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
of
your

say
Mary
,
well
use
to
the

of

He
nod
slightly

she
go
on

the

listen

then

It

Mary

by

by

It

now
fall
asleep

if

may
be
keep

He
have

nothing
after
throw
the
stick

but
she
have
see
him
take
his
key
again
and
lay
his

on

<EOS>
He
do

up

however
,
and
she
think
that

<EOS>
but
Mary

begin
to
be
more
agitate
by

question
those
act

presently
the

send
out
a
flame
which
illuminate
every
crevice

and
Mary
see
that

It
be
on
a
morning
of
May
that
Peter
Featherstone
be
bury
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
prosaic
neighborhood
of
Middlemarch
,
May
be
not
always
warm
and
sunny
,
and
on
this
particular
morning
a
chill
wind
be
blow
the
blossom
from
the
surround
garden
on
to
the
green
mound
of
Lowick
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
swiftly
move
cloud
only
now
and
then
allow
a
gleam
to
light
up
any
object
,
whether
ugly
or
beautiful
,
that
happen
to
stand
within
its
golden
shower
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
churchyard
the
object
be
remarkably
various
,
for
there
be
a
little
country
crowd
wait
to
see
the
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
the
news
have
spread
that
it
be
to
be
a
"
big
burying
;
"
the
old
gentleman
have
leave
write
direction
about
everything
and
mean
to
have
a
funeral
"
beyond
his
better
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
true
;
for
old
Featherstone
have
not
be
a
Harpagon
whose
passion
have
all
be
devour
by
the
ever
-
lean
and
ever
-
hungry
passion
of
saving
,
and
who
would
drive
a
bargain
with
his
undertaker
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
He
love
money
,
but
he
also
love
to
spend
it
in
gratify
his
peculiar
taste
,
and
perhaps
he
love
it
best
of
all
as
a
means
of
make
other
feel
his
power
more
or
less
uncomfortably
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
one
will
here
contend
that
there
must
have
be
trait
of
goodness
in
old
Featherstone
,
I
will
not
presume
to
deny
this
;
but
I
must
observe
that
goodness
be
of
a
modest
nature
,
easily
discourage
,
and
when
much
privacy
,
elbow
in
early
life
by
unabashed
vice
,
be
apt
to
retire
into
extreme
privacy
,
so
that
it
be
more
easily
believe
in
by
those
who
construct
a
selfish
old
gentleman
theoretically
,
than
by
those
who
form
the
narrow
judgment
base
on
his
personal
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
he
have
be
bent
on
have
a
handsome
funeral
,
and
on
have
person
"
bid
"
to
it
who
would
rather
have
stay
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
even
desire
that
female
relative
should
follow
him
to
the
grave
,
and
poor
sister
Martha
have
take
a
difficult
journey
for
this
purpose
from
the
Chalky
Flats
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
Jane
would
have
be
altogether
cheer
(
in
a
tearful
manner
)
by
this
sign
that
a
brother
who
dislike
see
them
while
he
be
live
have
be
prospectively
fond
of
their
presence
when
he
should
have
become
a
testator
,
if
the
sign
have
not
be
make
equivocal
by
be
extend
to
Mrs.
Vincy
,
whose
expense
in
handsome
crape
seem
to
imply
the
most
presumptuous
hope
,
aggravate
by
a
bloom
of
complexion
which
tell
pretty
plainly
that
she
be
not
a
blood
-
relation
,
but
of
that
generally
objectionable
class
call
wife
's
kin
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
us
imaginative
in
some
form
or
other
,
for
image
be
the
brood
of
desire
;
and
poor
old
Featherstone
,
who
laugh
much
at
the
way
in
which
other
cajole
themselves
,
do
not
escape
the
fellowship
of
illusion
.
 
<EOS>
in
write
the
programme
for
his
burial
he
certainly
do
not
make
clear
to
himself
that
his
pleasure
in
the
little
drama
of
which
it
form
a
part
be
confine
to
anticipation
.
 
<EOS>
in
chuckle
over
the
vexation
he
could
inflict
by
the
rigid
clutch
of
his
dead
hand
,
he
inevitably
mingle
his
consciousness
with
that
livid
stagnant
presence
,
and
so
far
as
he
be
preoccupy
with
a
future
life
,
it
be
with
one
of
gratification
inside
his
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
thus
old
Featherstone
be
imaginative
,
after
his
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
three
mourning
-
coach
be
fill
accord
to
the
write
order
of
the
deceased
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
pall
-
bearer
on
horseback
,
with
the
rich
scarf
and
hatband
,
and
even
the
under
-
bearer
have
trapping
of
woe
which
be
of
a
good
well
-
price
quality
.
 
<EOS>
the
black
procession
,
when
dismount
,
look
the
large
for
the
smallness
of
the
churchyard
;
the
heavy
human
face
and
the
black
drapery
shiver
in
the
wind
seem
to
tell
of
a
world
strangely
incongruous
with
the
lightly
drop
blossom
and
the
gleam
of
sunshine
on
the
daisy
.
<EOS>
the
clergyman
who
meet
the
procession
be
Mr.
Cadwallader
 
also
accord
to
the
request
of
Peter
Featherstone
,
prompt
as
usual
by
peculiar
reason
.
 
<EOS>
have
a
contempt
for
curate
,
whom
he
always
call
understrapper
,
he
be
resolve
to
be
bury
by
a
benefice
clergyman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
be
out
of
the
question
,
not
merely
because
he
decline
duty
of
this
sort
,
but
because
Featherstone
have
an
especial
dislike
to
him
as
the
rector
of
his
own
parish
,
who
have
a
lien
on
the
land
in
the
shape
of
tithe
,
also
as
the
deliverer
of
morning
sermon
,
which
the
old
man
,
be
in
his
pew
and
not
at
all
sleepy
,
have
be
oblige
to
sit
through
with
an
inward
snarl
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
an
objection
to
a
parson
stick
up
above
his
head
preach
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
relation
with
Mr.
Cadwallader
have
be
of
a
different
kind
:
<EOS>
the
trout
-
stream
which
run
through
Mr.
Casaubon
's
land
take
its
course
through
Featherstone
's
also
,
so
that
Mr.
Cadwallader
be
a
parson
who
have
have
to
ask
a
favor
instead
of
preach
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
be
one
of
the
high
gentry
live
four
mile
away
from
Lowick
,
and
be
thus
exalt
to
an
equal
sky
with
the
sheriff
of
the
county
and
other
dignity
vaguely
regard
as
necessary
to
the
system
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
a
satisfaction
in
be
bury
by
Mr.
Cadwallader
,
whose
very
name
offer
a
fine
opportunity
for
pronouncing
wrongly
if
you
like
.
  
<EOS>
this
distinction
confer
on
the
Rector
of
Tipton
and
Freshitt
<EOS>
be
the
reason
why
Mrs.
Cadwallader
make
one
of
the
group
that
watch
old
Featherstone
's
funeral
from
an
upper
window
of
the
manor
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
fond
of
visit
that
house
,
but
she
like
,
as
she
say
,
to
see
collection
of
strange
animal
such
as
there
would
be
at
this
funeral
;
and
she
have
persuade
Sir
James
and
the
young
Lady
Chettam
to
drive
the
rector
and
herself
to
Lowick
in
order
that
the
visit
may
be
altogether
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
anywhere
with
you
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
"
Celia
have
say
;

but
I
do
not
like
funeral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
when
you
have
a
clergyman
in
your
family
you
must
accommodate
your
taste
:
I
do
that
very
early
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
marry
Humphrey
I
make
up
my
mind
to
like
sermon
,
and
I
set
out
by
like
the
end
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
that
soon
spread
to
the
middle
and
the
beginning
,
because
I
could
not
have
the
end
without
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
to
be
sure
not
,
"
say
the
Dowager
Lady
Chettam
,
with
stately
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
the
upper
window
from
which
the
funeral
could
be
well
see
be
in
the
room
occupy
by
Mr.
Casaubon
when
he
have
be
forbid
to
work
;
but
he
have
resume
nearly
his
habitual
style
of
life
now
in
spite
of
warning
and
prescription
,
and
after
politely
welcome
Mrs.
Cadwallader
have
slip
again
into
the
library
to
chew
a
cud
of
erudite
mistake
about
Cush
and
Mizraim
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
her
visitor
Dorothea
too
may
have
be
shut
up
in
the
library
,
and
would
not
have
witness
this
scene
of
old
Featherstone
's
funeral
,
which
,
aloof
as
it
seem
to
be
from
the
tenor
of
her
life
,
always
afterwards
come
back
to
her
at
the
touch
of
certain
sensitive
point
in
memory
,
just
as
the
vision
of
St.
Peter
's
at
Rome
be
inweave
with
mood
of
despondency
.
 
<EOS>
Scenes
which
make
vital
change
in
our
neighbor
'
lot
be
but
the
background
of
our
own
,
yet
,
like
a
particular
aspect
of
the
field
and
tree
,
they
become
associated
for
us
with
the
epochs
of
our
own
history
,
and
make
a
part
of
that
unity
which
lie
in
the
selection
of
our
keen
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
the
dream
-
like
association
of
something
alien
and
ill
-
understand
with
the
deep
secret
of
her
experience
seem
to
mirror
that
sense
of
loneliness
which
be
due
to
the
very
ardor
of
Dorothea
's
nature
.
 
<EOS>
the
country
gentry
of
old
time
live
in
a
rarefied
social
air
:
dot
apart
on
their
station
up
the
mountain
they
look
down
with
imperfect
discrimination
on
the
belt
of
thick
life
below
.
 
<EOS>
and
Dorothea
be
not
at
ease
in
the
perspective
and
chilliness
of
that
height
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
look
any
more
,
"
say
Celia
,
after
the
train
have
enter
the
church
,
place
herself
a
little
behind
her
husband
's
elbow
so
that
she
could
slyly
touch
his
coat
with
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
Dodo
like
it

:
she
be
fond

melancholy

ugly
people

"
I
be
fond
of
know
something
about
the
people
I

among

who
have
be
watch
everything
with
the
interest
of
a
monk
on
his
holiday
tour
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me

nothing

It

my

often

It

this
funeral
seem
to
me
the
most
dismal

blot

leave
no

She
be
go
to

more

she
see
her
husband
enter
and
seat
himself
a
little
in
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
the
difference
his
presence
make
to
her
be
not
always
a
happy
one

she
feel
that

often
inwardly
object
to
her
speech

<EOS>
"
positively
,

exclaim
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
"
there
be
a
new
face

out
from
behind

broad

queerer

a

round
head
with
bulge

stand

lean
forward
over
her

"
oh

what
an
odd
face
!

"
<EOS>
then
with

quick
change
to

she
add
,

why
,
Dodo
,
you
never
tell
me
that
Mr.
Ladislaw

come
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
feel
a
shock
of
alarm
:
every
one
notice
her
sudden
paleness
as
she
look
up
immediately
at
her
uncle

while
Mr.

look
at
her

"
He

up
with
me
at

say
Mr.
Brooke
,
in

easy
tone

nod
at
Dorothea
,
as
if
the
announcement
be
just
what
she
may
have
expect

<EOS>
"
and
we
have
bring
the
picture
at
the
top
of

carriage

<EOS>
I
know
you
would
be
pleased
with
the
surprise

there
you
be

Aquinas

you

quite
the
right

you

hear
young

talk
about
it

<EOS>
He
talk
uncommonly
well
 
<EOS>
point
out
this
,
that
,

the
other

everything

that
kind
 
companionable

up
with
you

any
track

I
have
be
want
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
bow
with
cold
politeness
,
master
his
irritation
,
but
only
so
far
as
to
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
Will
's
letter
quite
as
well
as
Dorothea
do
;
he
have
notice
that
it
be
not
among
the
letter
which
have
be
reserve
for
him
on
his
recovery
,
and
secretly
conclude
that
Dorothea
have
send
word
to
Will
not
to
come
to
Lowick
,
he
have
shrink
with
proud
sensitiveness
from
ever
recur
to
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
infer
that
she
have
ask
her
uncle
to
invite
Will
to
the
grange
;
and
she
feel
it
impossible
at
that
moment
to
enter
into
any
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
eye
,
divert
from
the
churchyard
,
see
a
good
deal
of
dumb
show
which
be
not
so
intelligible
to
her
as
she
could
have
desire
,
and
could
not
repress
the
question
,
"
who
be
Mr.
Ladislaw
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
young
relative
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
,
"
say
Sir
James
,
promptly
.
 
<EOS>
His
good
-
nature
often
make
him
quick
and
clear
-
see
in
personal
matter
,
and
he
have
divine
from
Dorothea
's
glance
at
her
husband
that
there
be
some
alarm
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
nice
young
fellow
 
<EOS>
Casaubon
have
do
everything
for
him
,
"
explain
Mr.
Brooke
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
repay
your
expense
in
him
,
Casaubon
,
"
he
go
on
,
nod
encouragingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
stay
with
me
a
long
while
<EOS>
and
we
shall
make
something
of
my
document
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
plenty
of
idea
and
fact
,
you
know
,
and
I
can
see
he
be
just
the
man
to
put
them
into
shape
 
<EOS>
remember
what
the
right
quotation
be
,
omne
tulit
punctum
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
 
give
subject
a
kind
of
turn
.
 
<EOS>
I
invite
him
some
time
ago
when
you
be
ill
,
Casaubon
;
Dorothea
say
you
could
not
have
anybody
in
the
house
,
you
know
,
and
she
ask
me
to
write
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothea
feel
that
every
word
of
her
uncle
's
be
about
as
pleasant
as
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
eye
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
altogether
unfit
now
to
explain
that
she
have
not
wish
her
uncle
to
invite
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
in
the
least
make
clear
to
herself
the
reason
for
her
husband
's
dislike
to
his
presence
 
<EOS>
a
dislike
painfully
impressed
on
her
by
the
scene
in
the
library
;
but
she
feel
the
unbecomingness
of
say
anything
that
may
convey
a
notion
of
it
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
,
indeed
,
have
not
thoroughly
represent
those
mix
reason
to
himself
;
irritated
feeling
with
him
,
as
with
all
of
us
,
seek
rather
for
justification
than
for
self
-
knowledge
.
<EOS>
but
he
wish
to
repress
outward
sign
,
and
only
Dorothea
could
discern
the
change
in
her
husband
's
face
before
he
observe
with
more
of
dignified
bending
and
sing
-
song
than
usual
    
<EOS>
"
You

exceedingly
hospitable

Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
everything

Mrs.

contentedly

<EOS>
but
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
Fred
be
under
some
difficulty
in
repress
a
laugh
,
which
would
have
be
more
unsuitable
than
his
father

snuff

box

<EOS>
Fred
have
overhear
Mr.

suggest
something
about
a
"
love

child

with
this
thought
in
his
mind
,
the
stranger

face

which
happen

affect
him
too
ludicrously

<EOS>
Mary
Garth
,
discern
his
distress
in
the
twitching
of
his
mouth

and
his
recourse
to
a
cough

come
cleverly
to
his
rescue
by
ask
him
to
change
seat
with
her

so
that
he
get
into
a
shadowy
corner

<EOS>
Fred
be
feel
as
good
-
naturedly
as
possible
towards
everybody
,
include
Rigg
;
and
have
some
relent
towards
all
these
people
who
be
less
lucky
than
he
be
aware
of
be
himself
,
he
would
not
for
the
world
have
behave
amiss
;
still
,
it
be
particularly
easy
to
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
entrance
of
the
lawyer
and
the
two
brother
draw
every
one
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
lawyer
be
Mr.
Standish
,
and
he
have
come
to
Stone
Court
this
morning
believe
that
he
know
thoroughly
well
<EOS>
who
would
be
pleased
and
who
disappoint
before
the
day
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
the
will
he
expect
to
read
<EOS>
be
the
last
of
three
which
he
have
draw
up
for
Mr.
Featherstone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Standish
be
not
a
man
who
vary
his
manner
:
he
behave
with
the
same
deep
-
voiced
,
off
-
hand
civility
to
everybody
,
as
if
he
see
no
difference
in
them
,
and
talk
chiefly
of
the
hay
-
crop
,
which
would
be
"
very
fine
,
by
God
!
"
<EOS>
of
the
last
bulletin
concern
the
King
,
and
of
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
be
a
sailor
every
inch
of
him
,
and
just
the
man
to
rule
over
an
island
like
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Featherstone
have
often
reflect
as
he
sit
look
at
the
fire
that
Standish
would
be
surprise
some
day
:
it
be
true
that
if
he
have
do
as
he
like
at
the
last
,
and
burn
the
will
draw
up
by
another
lawyer
,
he
would
not
have
secure
that
minor
end
;
still
he
have
have
his
pleasure
in
ruminate
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
certainly
Mr.
Standish
be
surprised
,
but
not
at
all
sorry
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
rather
enjoy
the
z
of
a
little
curiosity
in
his
own
mind
,
which
the
discovery
of
a
second
will
add
to
the
prospective
amazement
on
the
part
of
the
Featherstone
family
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
sentiment
of
Solomon
and
Jonah
,
they
be
hold
in
utter
suspense
:
it
seem
to
them
that
the
old
will
would
have
a
certain
validity
,
and
that
there
may
be
such
an
interlacement
of
poor
Peter
's
former
and
latter
intention
as
to
create
endless
"
lawing
"
before
anybody
come
by
their
own
 
an
inconvenience
which
would
have
at
least
the
advantage
of
go
all
round
.
 
<EOS>
hence
the
brother
show
a
thoroughly
neutral
gravity
as
they
re
-
enter
with
Mr.
Standish
;
but
Solomon
take
out
his
white
handkerchief
again
with
a
sense
that
in
any
case
there
would
be
affect
passage
,
and
cry
at
funeral
,
however
dry
,
be
customarily
serve
up
in
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
person
who
feel
the
most
throbbing
excitement
at
this
moment
be
Mary
Garth
,
in
the
consciousness
that
it
be
she
who
have
virtually
determine
the
production
of
this
second
will
,
which
may
have
momentous
effect
on
the
lot
of
some
person
present
.
 
<EOS>
no
soul
except
herself
know
what
have
pass
on
that
final
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
will
I
hold
in
my
hand
,
"
say
Mr.
Standish
,
who
,
seat
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
take
his
time
about
everything
,
include
the
cough
with
which
he
show
a
disposition
to
clear
his
voice
,

myself
and

our
deceased
friend

the
9th

<EOS>
but
I
find
that
there
be
a
subsequent
instrument
hitherto
unknown
to
me
,
bear
date
the
20th
of
July

cautiously

will

bear

March

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear

dear

"
say
sister
Martha
,
not
mean
to
be
audible
,
but
drive
to
some
articulation
under
this
pressure
of
date
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
begin
by

early

continue
Mr.
Standish

"
since
such

his
not

the
intention
of
deceased
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
preamble
be
feel
to
be
rather
long
,
and
several
besides
Solomon
shake
their
head
pathetically
,
look
on
the
ground
:
all
eye
avoid
meet
other
eye
,
and
be
chiefly
fix
either
on
the
spot
in
the
table
-
cloth
or
on
Mr.
Standish
's
bald
head
;
except
Mary
Garth
's
.
<EOS>
when
all
the
rest
be
try
to
look
nowhere
in
particular
,
it
be
safe
for
her
to
look
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
at
the
sound
of
the
first
"
give
and
bequeath
<EOS>
"
she
could
see
all
complexion
change
subtly
,
as
if
some
faint
vibration
be
pass
through
them
,
save
that
of
Mr.
Rigg
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
in
unaltered
calm
,
and
,
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
company
,
preoccupy
with
more
important
problem
,
and
with
the
complication
of
listen
to
bequest
which
may
or
may
not
be
revoke
,
have
cease
to
think
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
blush
,
and
Mr.
Vincy
find
it
impossible
to
do
without
his
snuff
-
box
in
his
hand
,
though
he
keep
it
close
.
  
<EOS>
the
small
bequest
come
first
,
and
even
the
recollection
that
there
be
another
will
and
that
poor
Peter
may
have
think
better
of
it
,
could
not
quell
the
rise
disgust
and
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
one
like
to
be
do
well
by
in
every
tense
,
past
,
present
,
and
future

<EOS>
and
here
be
Peter
capable
five
year
ago
of
leave
only
two
hundred
apiece
to
his
own
brother
and
sister
,
and
only
a
hundred
apiece
to
his
own
nephew
and
niece
:
the
Garths
be
not
mention
,
but
Mrs.
Vincy
and
Rosamond
be
each
to
have
a
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Trumbull
be
to
have
the
gold
-
head
cane
and
fifty
pound
;
the
other
second
cousin
and
the
cousin
present
be
each
to
have
the
like
handsome
sum
,
which
,
as
the
saturnine
cousin
observe
,
be
a
sort
of
legacy
that
leave
a
man
nowhere
;
and
there
be
much
more
of
such
offensive
dribbling
in
favor
of
person
not

problematical
,
and
,
it
be
to
be
fear

low
connection

<EOS>
altogether

reckon
hastily

here
be
about
three
thousand
disposed
of

where
then
have
Peter
mean
the
rest
of
the
money
to
go
 
and
where
the
land
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
revoke
and
what
not
revoke
 
and
be
the
revocation
for
well
or
for
bad
?
 
<EOS>
all
emotion
must
be
conditional
,
and
may
turn
out
to
be
the
wrong
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
strong
enough
to
bear
up
and
keep
quiet
under
this
confused
suspense
;
some
let
their
low
lip
fall
,
other
purse
it
up
,
accord
to
the
habit
of
their
muscle
.
<EOS>
but
Jane
and
Martha
sink
under
the
rush
of
question
,
and
begin
to
cry
;
poor
Mrs.
Cranch
be
half
move
with
the
consolation
of
get
any
hundred
at
all
without
work
for
them
,
and
half
aware
that
her
share
be
scanty
;
whereas
Mrs.
Waule
's
mind
be
entirely
flood
with
the
sense
of
be
an
own
sister
and
get
little
,
while
somebody
else
be
to
have
much
.
 
<EOS>
the
general
expectation
now
be
that
the
"
much
"
would
fall
to
Fred
Vincy
,
but
the
Vincys
themselves
be
surprised
when
ten
thousand
pound
in
specify
investment
be
declare
to
be
bequeath
to
him
:
 
<EOS>
be
the
land
come
too

<EOS>
Fred
bite
<EOS>
his

smile
,
and
Mrs.

feel
herself
the
happy
of
woman
 
possible
revocation
shrink
out
of
sight
in
this
dazzling
vision

<EOS>
there

the

will

everything

to
the
low
person
before
mention
(

bequest

Featherstones

accustom
visitor

<EOS>
another
stranger
have
be
bring
to
settle
in
the
neighborhood
of
Middlemarch
,
but
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
there
be
more
discontent
with
immediate
visible
consequence
than
speculation
as
to
the
effect
which
his
presence
may
have
in
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
no
soul
be
prophetic
enough
to
have
any
foreboding
as
to
what
may
appear
on
the
trial
of
Joshua
Rigg
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
be
naturally
lead
to
reflect
on
the
mean
of
elevate
a
low
subject
.
 
<EOS>
historical
parallel
be
remarkably
efficient
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
the
chief
objection
to
them
be
,
that
the
diligent
narrator
may
lack
space
,
or
(
what
be
often
the
same
thing
)
may
not
be
able
to
think
of
them
with
any
degree
of
particularity
,
though
he
may
have
a
philosophical
confidence
that
if
know
they
would
be
illustrative
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
an
easy
and
short
way
to
dignity
,
to
observe
that
 
since
there
never
be
a
true
story
which
could
not
be
tell
in
parable
,
where
you
may
put
a
monkey
for
a
margrave
,
and
vice
versa
 
<EOS>
whatever
have
be
or
be
to
be
narrate
by
me
about
low
people
,
may
be
ennoble
by
be
consider
a
parable
;
so
that
if
any
bad
habit
and
ugly
consequence
be
bring
into
view
,
the
reader
may
have
the
relief
of
regard
them
as
not
more
than
figuratively
ungenteel
,
and
may
feel
himself
virtually
in
company
with
person
of
some
style
.
 
<EOS>
thus
while
I
tell
the
truth
about
loobie
,
my
reader
's
imagination
nee
not
be
entirely
exclude
from
an
occupation
with
lord
;
and
the
petty
sum
which
any
bankrupt
of
high
standing
would
be
sorry
to
retire
upon
,
may
be
lift
to
the
level
of
high
commercial
transaction
by
the
inexpensive
addition
of
proportional
cipher
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
any
provincial
history
in
which
the
agent
be
all
of
high
moral
rank

that
must
be

date
long

twenty

he
should
by
this

know
that
he
need
to

have

ride

should
be

that
Mary

no

have
any
reason

this
be

declare
his

forbid
alike
either
a

marriage

an
engagement

must
be
too
lengthy

that
seem
very
simple

opinion

a
house
must
be
take
instead
of
the
room
he
at
present
occupy
;
and
Lydgate
,
have
hear
Rosamond
speak
with
admiration
of
old
Mrs.
Bretton
's
house
(
situate
in
Lowick
Gate
)
,
take
notice
when
it
fall
vacant
after
the
old
lady
's
death
,
and
immediately
enter
into
treaty
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
this
in
an
episodic
way
,
very
much
as
he
give
order
to
his
tailor
for
every
requisite
of
perfect
dress
,
without
any
notion
of
be
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
would
have
despise
any
ostentation
of
expense
;
his
profession
have
familiarize
him
with
all
grade
of
poverty
,
and
he
care
much
for
those
who
suffer
hardship
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
behave
perfectly
at
a
table
where
the
sauce
be
serve
in
a
jug
with
the
handle
off
,
and
he
would
have
remember
nothing
about
a
grand
dinner
except
that
a
man
be
there
who
talk
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
never
occur
to
him
that
he
should
live
in
any
other
than
what
he
would
have
call
an
ordinary
way
,
with
green
glass
for
hock
,
and
excellent
wait
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
in
warm
himself
at
french
social
theory
he
have
bring
away
no
smell
of
scorch
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
handle
even
extreme
opinion
with
impunity
while
our
furniture
,
our
dinner
-
giving
,
and
preference
for
armorial
bearing
in
our
own
case
,
link
us
indissolubly
with
the
establish
order
.
 
<EOS>
and
Lydgate
's
tendency
be
not
towards
extreme
opinion
:
he
would
have
like
no
barefoote
doctrine
,
be
particular
about
his
boot
:
he
be
no
radical
in
relation
to
anything
but
medical
reform
and
the
prosecution
of
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
rest
of
practical
life
he
walk
by
hereditary
habit
;
half
from
that
personal
pride
and
unreflecte
egoism
which
I
have
already
call
commonness
,
and
half
from
that
naivete
which
belong
to
preoccupation
with
favorite
idea
.
  
<EOS>
any
inward
debate
lydgate
have
as
to
the
consequence
of
this
engagement
which
have
steal
upon
him
,
turn
on
the
paucity
of
time
rather
than
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
,
be
in
love
and
be
expect
continually
by
some
one
who
always
turn
out
to
be
pretty
than
memory
could
represent
her
to
be
,
do
interfere
with
the
diligent
use
of
spare
hour
which
may
serve
some
"
plod
fellow
of
a
German
"
to
make
the
great
,
imminent
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
really
an
argument
for
not
defer
the
marriage
too
long
,
as
he
imply
to
Mr.
Farebrother
,
<EOS>
one
day
that
the
Vicar
come
to
his
room
with
some
pond
-
product
which
he
want
to
examine
under
a
well
microscope
than
his
own
,
and
,
find
Lydgate
's
tableful
of
apparatus
and
specimen
in
confusion
,
say
sarcastically
    
"
Eros
have
degenerate
;
he
begin
by
introduce
order
and
harmony
,
and
now
he
bring
back
chaos
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
at
some
stage
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
lift
his
brow
and
smile
,
while
he
begin
to
arrange
his
microscope
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
a
well
order
will
begin
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
soon
?
"
say
the
Vicar
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
this
unsettled
state
of
affair
use
up
the
time
,
and
when
one
have
notion
in
science
,
every
moment
be
an
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
marriage
must
be
the
good
thing
for
a
man
who
want
to
work
steadily
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
everything
at
home
<EOS>
then
 
no
tease
with
personal
speculation
 
he
can
get
calmness
and
freedom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
an
enviable
dog
,
"
say
the
Vicar
,
"
to
have
such
a
prospect
 
rosamond
,
calmness
and
freedom
,
all
to
your
share
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
I
with
nothing
but
my
pipe
and
pond
-
animalcule
.
<EOS>
now
,
be
you
ready
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
mention
to
the
Vicar
another
reason
he
have
for
wish
to
shorten
the
period
of
courtship
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
irritate
to
him
,
even
with
the
wine
of
love
in
his
vein
,
to
be
oblige
to
mingle
so
often
with
the
family
party
at
the
Vincys
'
,
and
to
enter
so
much
into
Middlemarch
gossip
,
protract
good
cheer
,
whist
-
play
,
and
general
futility
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
to
be
deferential
when
Mr.
Vincy
decide
question
with
trenchant
ignorance
,
especially
as
to
those
liquor
which
be
the
good
inward
pickle
,
preserve
you
from
the
effect
of
bad
air
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vincy
's
openness
and
simplicity
be
quite
unstreaked
with
suspicion
as
to
the
subtle
offence
she
may
give
to
the
taste
of
her
intend
son
-
in
-
law
;
and
altogether
Lydgate
have
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
be
descend
a
little
in
relation
to
Rosamond
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
exquisite
creature
herself
suffer
in
the
same
sort
of
way
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
at
least
one
delightful
thought
that
in
marry
her
,
he
could
give
her
a
much
-
need
transplantation
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
her
one
evening
,
in
his
gentle
tone
,
as
he
sit
down
by
her
and
look
closely
at
her
face
    
<EOS>
but
I
must
first
say
that
he
have
find
her
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
the
great
old
-
fashioned
window
,
almost
as
large
as
the
side
of
the
room
,
be
open
to
the
summer
scent
of
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
and
mother
be
go
to
a
party
,
and
the
rest
be
all
out
with
the
butterfly
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
!
<EOS>
your
eyelid
be
red
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
they
?
"
say
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
why
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
her
nature
to
pour
forth
wish
or
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
come
forth
gracefully
on
solicitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
if
you
could
hide
it
from
me
!
"
say
Lydgate
,
lay
his
hand
tenderly
on
both
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
I
see
a
tiny
drop
on
one
of
the
lash
?
 
<EOS>
thing
trouble
you
,
and
you
do
not
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
unlove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
tell
you
what
you
can
not
alter
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
every
-
day
thing
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
have
be
a
little
worse
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
family
annoyance
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
fear
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
have
be
more
irritable
lately
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
make
him
angry
,
and
this
morning
there
be
a
fresh
quarrel
because
Fred
threaten
to
throw
his
whole
education
away
,
and
do
something
quite
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
besides
 
"
  
Rosamond
hesitate
,
and
her
cheek
be
gather
a
slight
flush
.
<EOS>
lydgate
have
never
see
her
in
trouble
since
the
morning
of
their
engagement
,
and
he
have
never
feel
so
passionately
towards
her
as
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
kiss
the
hesitating
lip
gently
,
as
if
to
encourage
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
papa
be
not
quite
pleased
about
our
engagement
,
"
Rosamond
continued
,
almost
in
a
whisper
;
"
and
he
say
last
night
that
he
should
certainly
speak
to
you
and
say
it
must
be
give
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
it
up
?
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
quick
energy
 
almost
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
give
up
anything
that
I
choose
to
do
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
recover
her
calmness
at
the
touching
of
this
chord
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
Lydgate
,
kiss
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
constancy
of
purpose
in
the
right
place
be
adorable
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
on
:
    
"
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
now
for
your
father
to
say
that
our
engagement
must
be
give
up
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
of
age
,
and
I
claim
you
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
if
anything
be
do
to
make
you
unhappy
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
reason
for
hasten
our
marriage
.
"
  
<EOS>
an
unmistakable
delight
shine
forth
from
the
blue
eye
that
meet
his
,
and
the
radiance
seem
to
light
up
all
his
future
with
mild
sunshine
.
<EOS>
ideal
happiness
(
of
the
kind
know
in
the
Arabian
Nights
,
in
which
you
be
invite
to
step
from
the
labor
and
discord
of
the
street
into
a
paradise
where
everything
be
give
to
you
and
nothing
claim
)
seem
to
be
an
affair
of
a
few
week
'
waiting
,
more
or
less
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
we
defer
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
ardent
insistence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
take
the
house
now
:
everything
else
can
soon
be
get
ready
 
<EOS>
can
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
mind
about
new
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
those
can
be
buy
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
original
notion
you
clever
man
have
!
"
say
Rosamond
,
dimple
with
more
thorough
laughter
than
usual
at
this
humorous
incongruity
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
first
time
I
ever
hear
of
wedding
-
clothe
be
buy
after
marriage
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
would
insist
on
my
waiting
month
for
the
sake
of
clothe
?
"
say
Lydgate
,
half
thinking
that
Rosamond
be
torment
him
prettily
,
and
half
fear
that
she
really
shrink
from
speedy
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
"
remember
,
we
be
look
forward
to
a
well
sort
of
happiness
even
than
this
 
be
continually
together
,
independent
of
other
,
and
order
our
life
as
we
will
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
dear
,
tell
me
how
soon
you
can
be
altogether
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
serious
pleading
in
Lydgate
's
tone
,
as
if
he
feel
that
she
would
be
injure
him
by
any
fantastic
delay
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
become
serious
too
,
and
slightly
meditative
;
in
fact
,
she
be
go
through
many
intricacy
of
lace
-
edging
and
hosiery
and
petticoat
-
tucking
,
in
order
to
give
an
answer
that
would
at
least
be
approximative
.
  
<EOS>
"
six
week
would
be
ample
 
say
so
,
Rosamond
,
"
insist
Lydgate
,
release
her
hand
to
put
his
arm
gently
round
her
.
  
<EOS>
one
little
hand
immediately
go
to
pat
her
hair
,
while
she
give
her
neck
a
meditative
turn
,
and
then
say
seriously
    
"
there
would
be
the
house
-
linen
and
the
furniture
to
be
prepare
.
<EOS>
still
,
mamma
could
see
to
those
while
we
be
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
away
a
week
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
more
than
that
!
"
say
Rosamond
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
think
of
her
evening
dress
for
the
visit
to
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
's
,
which
she
have
long
be
secretly
hope
for
as
a
delightful
employment
of
at
least
one
quarter
of
the
honeymoon
,
even
if
she
defer
her
introduction
to
the
uncle
who
be
a
doctor
of
divinity
(
also
a
pleasing
though
sober
kind
of
rank
,
when
sustain
by
blood
)
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
her
lover
with
some
wonder
remonstrance
as
she
speak
,
and
he
readily
understand
that
she
may
wish
to
lengthen
the
sweet
time
of
double
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
you
wish
,
my
darling
,
when
the
day
be
fix
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
us
take
a
decide
course
,
and
put
an
end
to
any
discomfort
you
may
be
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
six
week
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
would
be
ample
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
certainly
hasten
the
work
,
"
say
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
,
then
,
mention
it
to
papa
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
well
to
write
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
blush
and
look
at
him
as
the
garden
flower
look
at
us
when
we
walk
forth
happily
among
them
in
the
transcendent
evening
light
:
be
there
not
a
soul
beyond
utterance
,
half
nymph
,
half
child
,
in
those
delicate
petal
which
glow
and
breathe
about
the
centre
of
deep
color
?
  
<EOS>
He
touch
her
ear
and
a
little
bit
of
neck
under
it
with
his
lip
,
and
they
sit
quite
still
for
many
minute
which
flow
by
them
like
a
small
gurgling
brook
with
the
kiss
of
the
sun
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
think
that
no
one
could
be
more
in
love
than
she
be
;
and
Lydgate
think
that
after
all
his
wild
mistake
and
absurd
credulity
,
he
have
find
perfect
womanhood
 
<EOS>
feel
as
if
already
breathe
upon
by
exquisite
wed
affection
such
as
would
be
bestow
by
an
accomplished
creature
who
venerate
his
high
musing
and
momentous
labor
and
would
never
interfere
with
them
;
who
would
create
order
in
the
home
and
account
with
still
magic
,
yet
keep
her
finger
ready
to
touch
the
lute
and
transform
life
into
romance
at
any
moment
;
who
be
instruct
to
the
true
womanly
limit
and
not
a
hair's
-
breadth
beyond
 
docile
,
therefore
,
and
ready
to
carry
out
behest
which
come
from
that
limit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plainer
now
than
ever
that
his
notion
of
remain
much
long
a
bachelor
have
be
a
mistake
<EOS>
:
marriage
would
not
be
an
obstruction
but
a
furtherance
.
 
<EOS>
and
happen
the
next
day
to
accompany
a
patient
to
Brassing
,
he
see
a
dinner
-
service
there
which
strike
him
as
so
exactly
the
right
thing
that
he
buy
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
save
time
to
do
these
thing
just
when
you
think
of
them
,
and
Lydgate
hate
ugly
crockery
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
-
service
in
question
be
expensive
,
but
that
may
be
in
the
nature
of
dinner
-
service
.
<EOS>
furnish
be
necessarily
expensive
;
but
then
it
have
to
be
do
only
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
lovely
,
"
say
Mrs.
Vincy
,
when
Lydgate
mention
his
purchase
with
some
descriptive
touch
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
what
Rosy
ought
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
trust
in
heaven
it
will
not
be
break
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
must
hire
servant
who
will
not
break
thing
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
(
certainly
,
this
be
reason
with
an
imperfect
vision
of
sequence
.
<EOS>
but
at
that
period
there
be
no
sort
of
reasoning
which
be
not
more
or
less

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a

till
Mr.

,
"
well

well

child
,
he
must
write
to
me
first
before
I
can
answer
him
,
"
 
and
Rosamond
be
certain
that
she
have
gain
her
point
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
's
answer
consist
chiefly
in
a
demand
that
Lydgate
should
insure
his
life
 
a
demand
immediately
concede
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
delightfully
reassuring
idea
supposing
that
Lydgate
die
,
but
in
the
mean
time
not
a
self
-
support
idea
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
seem
to
make
everything
comfortable
about
Rosamond
's
marriage
;
and
the
necessary
purchase
go
on
with
much
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
not
without
prudential
consideration
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
a
bride
(
who
be
go
to
visit
at
a
baronet
's
)
must
have
a
few
first
-
rate
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
;
but
beyond
the
absolutely
necessary
half
-
dozen
,
Rosamond
content
herself
without
the
very
high
style
of
embroidery
and
valencienne
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
also
<EOS>
,
find
that
his
sum
of
eight
hundred
pound
have
be
considerably
reduce
since
he
have
come
to
Middlemarch
,
restrain
his
inclination
for
some
plate
of
an
old
pattern
which
be
show
to
him
when
he
go
into
Kibble
's
establishment
at
brasse
to
buy
fork
and
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
proud
to
act
as
if
he
presuppose
that
Mr.
Vincy
would
advance
money
to
provide
furniture
;
and
though
,
since
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
pay
for
everything
at
once
,
some
bill
would
be
leave
stand
over
,
he
do
not
waste
time
in
conjecture
how
much
his
father
-
in
-
law
would
give
in
the
form
of
dowry
,
to
make
payment
easy
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
do
anything
extravagant
,
but
the
requisite
thing
must
be
buy
,
and
it
would
be
bad
economy
to
buy
them
of
a
poor
quality
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
matter
be
by
the
bye
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
foresaw
that
science
and
his
profession
be
the
object
he
should
alone
pursue
enthusiastically
;
but
he
could
not
imagine
himself
pursue
them
in
such
a
home
as
Wrench
have
 
the
door
all
open
,
the
oil
-
cloth
wear
,
the
child
in
soiled
pinafore
,
and
lunch
linger
in
the
form
of
bone
,
black
-
handle
knife
,
and
willow
-
pattern
.
<EOS>
but
Wrench
have
a
wretched
lymphatic
wife
who
make
a
mummy
of
herself
indoor
in
a
large
shawl
;
and
he
must
have
altogether
begin
with
an
ill
-
choose
domestic
apparatus
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
however
,
be
on
her
side
much
occupy
with
conjecture
,
though
her
quick
imitative
perception
warn
her
against
betray
them
too
crudely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
like
so
much
to
know
your

she
say
one
day
,
when
the
wedding
journey
be

<EOS>
"
We
may
perhaps
take
a
direction
that
would
allow
us
to
see

<EOS>

your

You

at
Quallingham

when
you
be

<EOS>
I
should
so
like
to

everything

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

say
Lydgate
,
carelessly
,
turn
in
his
chair
and
rub
his
hair
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
send
him
word
of
it
,
you
naughty
undutiful
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
perhaps
ask
you
to
take
me
to
Quallingham
;
and
then
you
could
show
me
about
the
ground
,
and
I
could
imagine
you
there
when
you
be
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
remember
,
you
see
me
in
my
home
,
just
as
it
have
be
since
I
be
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
fair
that
I
should
be
so
ignorant
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
would
be
a
little
ashamed
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
smile
at
her
tenderly
,
and
really
accept
the
suggestion
that
the
proud
pleasure
of
show
so
charm
a
bride
be
worth
some
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
come
to
think
of
it
,
he
would
like
to
see
the
old
spot
with
Rosamond
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
him
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
cousin
be
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
magnificent
to
Rosamond
to
be
able
to
speak
so
slightingly
of
a
baronet
's
family
,
and
she
feel
much
contentment
in
the
prospect
of
be
able
to
estimate
them
contemptuously
on
her
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
but
mamma
be
near
spoil
all
,
a
day
or
two
later
,
by
say
    
"
I
hope
your
uncle
Sir
Godwin
will
not
look
down
on
Rosy
,
Mr.
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
he
would
do
something
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
or
two
can
be
nothing
to
a
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
!
"
say
Rosamond
,
blush
deeply
;
and
Lydgate
pity
her
so
much
that
he
remain
silent
and
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
examine
a
print
curiously
,
as
if
he
have
be
absent
-
minded
.
<EOS>
Mamma
have
a
little
filial
lecture
afterwards
,
and
be
docile
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
reflect
that
if
any
of
those
high
-
breed
cousin
who
be
bore
,
should
be
induce
to
visit
Middlemarch
,
they
would
see
many
thing
in
her
own
family
which
may
shock
them
.
 
<EOS>
hence
it
seem
desirable
that
Lydgate
should
by
-
and
-
by
get
some
first
-
rate
position
elsewhere
than
in
Middlemarch
;
and
this
could
hardly
be
difficult
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
have
a
titled
uncle
and
could
make
discovery
.
<EOS>
lydgate
,
you
perceive
,
have
talk
fervidly
to
Rosamond
of
his
hope
as
to
the
high
use
of
his
life
,
and
have
find
it
delightful
to
be
listen
to
by
a
creature
who
would
bring
him
the
sweet
furtherance
of
satisfy
affection

lydgate
rely
much
on
the
psychological
difference
between
what
for
the
sake
of
variety
I
will
call
goose
and
gander

especially
on
the
innate
submissiveness

buyer
of

find
themselves
in

anomalous
position

during

on

many
have
give

the
"

which
have
a
motto
from

its

they

satisfied
with

since

in

flaccidity

nobody

become
feeble

Mr.

's
disgust
at
the
notion

edit
by
an
emissary

and
of

become
actively
political
 
as
if
a
tortoise

desultory

protrude
its
small
head
ambitiously
and
become
rampant
 
be
hardly
equal
to
the
annoyance
feel
by
some
member
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
own
family
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
have
ooze
forth
gradually
,
like
the
discovery
that
your
neighbor
have
set
up
an
unpleasant
kind
of
manufacture
which
will
be
permanently
under

legal
remedy

<EOS>
the
"
Pioneer
"
have
be
secretly
buy
even
before
Will

's
arrival
,
the
expect
opportunity
have
offer
itself
in
the
readiness
of
the
proprietor
to
part
with
a
valuable
property
which
do
not
pay
;
and
in
the
interval
since
Mr.
Brooke
have
write
his
invitation
,
those
germinal
idea
of
make
his
mind
tell
upon
the
world
at
large
which
have
be
present
in
him
from
his
young
year
,
but
have
hitherto
lain
in
some
obstruction
,
have
be
sprout
under
cover
.
  
<EOS>
the
development
be
much
further
by
a
delight
in
his
guest
which
prove
great
even
than
he
have
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
seem
that
Will
be
not
only
at
home
in
all
those
artistic
and
literary
subject
which
Mr.
Brooke
have
go
into
at
one
time
,
but
that
he
be
strikingly
ready
at
seize
the
point
of
the
political
situation
,
and
deal
with
them
in
that
large
spirit
which
,
aid
by
adequate
memory
,
lend
itself
to
quotation
and
general
effectiveness

<EOS>
"
He
seem
to
me
a
kind

you

"
Mr.

take
an
opportunity

for
the
gratification
of
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
as
to
anything
objectionable
 
laxity

or
anything
of

kind
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
's
sentiment
in

way
I
be
sure
be
good
 
indeed
,
we
be
talk
a
great
deal
together
last
night

he
have
the

sort
of

freedom

emancipation

thing
under
guidance
 
under
guidance
,
you

<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
be
able
to
put
him
on
the
right
tack
;
and
I
be
the
more
pleased
because
he
be
a
relation
of
yours
,
Casaubon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
the
right
tack
imply
anything
more
precise
than
the
rest
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
speech
,
Mr.
Casaubon
silently
hope
that
it
refer
to
some
occupation
at
a
great
distance
from
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
dislike
Will
while
he
help
him
,
but
he
have
begin
to
dislike
him
still
more
now
that
Will
have
decline
his
help
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
with
us
when
we
have
any
uneasy
jealousy
in
our
disposition
:
if
our
talent
be
chiefly
of
the
burrowing
kind
,
our
honey
-
sip
cousin
(
whom
we
have
grave
reason
for
object
to
)
be
likely
to
have
a
secret
contempt
for
us
,
and
any
one
who
admire
him
pass
an
oblique
criticism
on
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
have
the
scruple
of
rectitude
in
our
soul
,
we
be
above
the
meanness
of
injure
him
 
rather
we
meet
all
his
claim
on
us
by
active
benefit
;
and
the
drawing
of
cheque
for
him
,
be
a
superiority
which
he
must
recognize
,
give
our
bitterness
a
milder
infusion
.
 
<EOS>
now
Mr.
Casaubon
have
be
deprive
of
that
superiority
(
as
anything
more
than
a
remembrance
)
in
a
sudden
,
capricious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
His
antipathy
to
Will
do
not
spring
from
the
common
jealousy
of
a
winter
-
wear
husband
:
it
be
something
deep
,
breed
by
his
lifelong
claim
and
discontent
;
but
Dorothea
,
now
that
she
be
present
 
Dorothea
,
as
a
young
wife
who
herself
have
show
an
offensive
capability
of
criticism
,
necessarily
give
concentration
to
the
uneasiness
which
have
before
be
vague
.
  
<EOS>
Will
ladislaw
on
his
side
feel
that
his
dislike
be
flourish
at
the
expense
of
his
gratitude
,
and
spend
much
inward
discourse
in
justify
the
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
Casaubon
hate
him
 
he
know
that
very
well
;
on
his
first
entrance
he
could
discern
a
bitterness
in
the
mouth
and
a
venom
in
the
glance
which
would
almost
justify
declare
war
in
spite
of
past
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
much
oblige
to
Casaubon
in
the
past
,
but
really
the
act
of
marry
this
wife
be
a
set
-
off
against
the
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
question
whether
gratitude
which
refer
to
what
be
do
for
one
's
self
ought
not
to
give
way
to
indignation
at
what
be
do
against
another
.
 
<EOS>
and
Casaubon
have
do
a
wrong
to
Dorothea
in
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
be
bind
to
know
himself
better
than
that
,
and
if
he
choose
to
grow
gray
crunching
bone
in
a
cavern
,
he
have
no
business
to
be
lure
a
girl
into
his
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
most
horrible
of
virgin
-
sacrifice
,
"
say
Will
;
and
he
paint
to
himself
what
be
Dorothea
's
inward
sorrow
as
if
he
have
be
write
a
choric
wail
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
would
never
lose
sight
of
her
<EOS>
:
he
would
watch
over
her
 
if
he
give
up
everything
else
in
life
he
would
watch
over
her
,
and
she
should
know
that
she
have
one
slave
in
the
world
,
Will
have
 
to
use
Sir
Thomas
Browne
's
phrase
 
a
"
passionate
prodigality
"
of
statement
both
to
himself
and
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
simple
truth
be
that
nothing
then
invite
him
so
strongly
as
the
presence
of
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
invitation
of
the
formal
kind
have
be
want
,
however
,
for
Will
have
never
be
ask
to
go
to
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
,
indeed
,
confident
of
do
everything
agreeable
which
Casaubon
,
poor
fellow
,
be
too
much
absorb
to
think
of
,
have
arrange
to
bring
Ladislaw
to
Lowick
several
time
<EOS>
(
not
neglect
meanwhile
to
introduce
him
elsewhere
on
every
opportunity
as
"
a
young
relative
of
Casaubon
's
"
)
.
<EOS>
and
though
Will
have
not
see
Dorothea
alone
,
their
interview
have
be
enough
to
restore
her
former
sense
of
young
companionship
with
one
who
be
clever
than
herself
,
yet
seem
ready
to
be
sway
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothea
before
her
marriage
have
never
find
much
room
in
other
mind
for
what
she
care
most
to
say
;
and
she
have
not
,
as
we
know
,
enjoy
her
husband
's
superior
instruction
so
much
as
she
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
speak
with
any
keenness
of
interest
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
he
hear
her
with
an
air
of
patience
as
if
she
have
give
a
quotation
from
the
Delectus
familiar
to
him
from
his
tender
year
,
and
sometimes
mention
curtly
what
ancient
sect
or
personage
have
hold
similar
idea
,
as
if
there
be
too
much
of
that
sort
in
stock
already
;
at
other
time
he
would
inform
her
that
she
be
mistaken
,
and
reassert
what
her
remark
have
question
.
  
<EOS>
but
Will
Ladislaw
always
seem
to
see
more
in
what
she
say
than
she
herself
see
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
little
vanity
,
but
she
have
the
ardent
woman
's
need
to
rule
beneficently
by
make
the
joy
of
another
soul
.
<EOS>
hence
the
mere
chance
of
see
Will
occasionally
be
like
a
lunette
open
in
the
wall
of
her
prison
,
give
her
a
glimpse
of
the
sunny
air
;
and
this
pleasure
begin
to
nullify
her
original
alarm
at
what
her
husband
may
think
about
the
introduction
of
Will
as
her
uncle
's
guest
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
subject
Mr.
Casaubon
have
remain
dumb
.
  
<EOS>
but
Will
want
to
talk
with
Dorothea
alone
,
and
be
impatient
of
slow
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
however
slight
the
terrestrial
intercourse
between
Dante
and
Beatrice
or
Petrarch
and
Laura
<EOS>
,
time
change
the
proportion
of
thing
,
and
in
later
day
it
be
preferable
to
have
few
sonnet
and
more
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
necessity
excuse
stratagem
,
but
stratagem
be
limit
by
the
dread
of
offend
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
out
at
last
that
he
want
to
take
a
particular
sketch
at
Lowick
;
and
one
morning
when
Mr.
Brooke
have
to
drive
along
the
Lowick
road
on
his
way
to
the
county
town
,
Will
ask
to
be
set
down
with
his
sketch
-
book
and
camp
-
stool
at
Lowick
,
and
without
announce
himself
at
the
Manor
settle
himself
to
sketch
in
a
position
where
he
must
see
Dorothea
if
she
come
out
to
walk
 
and
he
know
that
she
usually
walk
an
hour
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
stratagem
be
defeat
by
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
cloud
gather
with
treacherous
quickness
,
the
rain
come
down
,
and
Will
be
oblige
to
take
shelter
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
intend
,
on
the
strength
of
relationship
,
to
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
wait
there
without
be
announce
;
and
see
his
old
acquaintance
the
butler
in
the
hall
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
"
do
not
mention
that
I
be
here
,
Pratt
;
I
will
wait
till
luncheon
;
I
know
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
like
to
be
disturb
when
he
be
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Master
be
out
,
sir
;
there
be
only
Mrs.
Casaubon
in
the
library
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
better
tell
her
you
be
here
,
sir
,
"
say
Pratt
,
a
red
-
cheek
man
give
to
lively
converse
with
Tantripp
,
and
often
agree
with
her
that
it
must
be
dull
for
Madam
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
very
well
;
this
confound
rain
have
hinder
me
from
sketching
,
"
say
Will
,
feel
so
happy
that
he
affect
indifference
with
delightful
ease
.
  
<EOS>
in
another
minute
he
be
in
the
library
,
and
Dorothea
be
meet
him
with
her
sweet
unconstrained
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Casaubon
have
go
to
the
Archdeacon
's
,
"
she
say
,
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
he
will
be
at
home
again
long
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
uncertain
how
long
he
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
want
to
say
anything
particular
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
come
to
sketch
,
but
the
rain
drive
me
in
.
 
<EOS>
else
I
would
not
have
disturb
you
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
Mr.
Casaubon
be
here
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
dislike
interruption
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
indebted
to
the
rain
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
to
see
you
.
"
<EOS>
Dorothea
utter
these
common
word
with
the
simple
sincerity
of
an
unhappy
child
,
visit
at
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
come
for
the
chance
of
see
you
alone
,
"
say
Will
,
mysteriously
force
to
be
just
as
simple
as
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
stay
to
ask
himself
,
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
talk
about
thing
,
as
we
do
in
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
make
a
difference
when
other
people
be
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
in
her
clear
full
tone
of
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
sit
down
.
"
<EOS>
She
seat
herself
on
a
dark
ottoman
with
the
brown
book
behind
her
,
look
in
her
plain
dress
of
some
thin
woollen
-
white
material
,
without
a
single
ornament
on
her
besides
her
wedding
-
ring
,
as
if
she
be
under
a
vow
to
be
different
from
all
other
woman
;
and
Will
sat
down
opposite
her
at
two
yard
'
distance
,
the
light
fall
on
his
bright
curl
and
delicate
but
rather
petulant
profile
,
with
its
defiant
curve
of
lip
and
chin
.
 
<EOS>
each
look
at
the
other
as
if
they
have
be
two
flower
which
have
open
then
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
for
the
moment
forget
her
husband
's
mysterious
irritation
against
Will
:
it
seem
fresh
water
at
her
thirsty
lip
to
speak
without
fear
to
the
one
person
whom
she
have
find
receptive
;
for
in
look
backward
through
sadness
she
exaggerate
a
past
solace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
think
that
I
should
like
to
talk
to
you
again
,
"
she
say
,
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
strange
to
me
how
many
thing
I
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
them
all
,
"
say
Will
,
with
the
unspeakable
content
in
his
soul
of
feeling
that
he
be
in
the
presence
of
a
creature
worthy
to
be
perfectly
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
his
own
feeling
at
that
moment
be
perfect
,
for
we
mortal
have
our
divine
moment
,
when
love
be
satisfied
in
the
completeness
of
the
beloved
object
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
try
to
learn
a
great
deal
since
we
be
in
Rome
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
read
Latin
a
little
,
and
I
be
begin
to
understand
just
a
little
Greek
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
help
Mr.
Casaubon
better
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
find
out
reference
for
him
and
save
his
eye
in
many
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
difficult
to
be
learn
;
it
seem
as
if
people
be
wear
out
on
the
way
to
great
thought
,
and
can
never
enjoy
them
because
they
be
too
tired
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
a
man
have
a
capacity
for
great
thought
,
he
be
likely
to
overtake
them
before
he
be
decrepit
,
"
say
Will
,
with
irrepressible
quickness
.
<EOS>
but
through
certain
sensibility
Dorothea
be
as
quick
as
he
,
and
see
her
face
change
,
he
add
,
immediately
,
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
quite
true
that
the
good
mind
have
be
sometimes
overstrain
in
work
out
their
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
correct
me
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
express
myself
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
say
that
those
who
have
great
thought
get
too
much
wear
in
work
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
feel
about
that
,
even
when
I
be
a
little
girl
;
and
it
always
seem
to
me
that
the
use
I
should
like
to
make
of
my
life
would
be
to
help
some
one
who
do
great
work
,
so
that
his
burthen
may
be
light
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
lead
on
to
this
bit
of
autobiography
without
any
sense
of
make
a
revelation
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
never
before
say
anything
to
Will
which
throw
so
strong
a
light
on
her
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
shrug
his
shoulder
;
and
for
want
of
that
muscular
outlet
he
think
the
more
irritably
of
beautiful
lip
kiss
holy
skull
and
other
emptiness
ecclesiastically
enshrine
.
 
<EOS>
also
he
have
to
take
care
that
his
speech
should
not
betray
that
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
easily
carry
the
help
too
far
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
get
over
-
work
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
not
too
much
shut
up
?
 
<EOS>
You
already
look
paler
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
for
Mr.
Casaubon
to
have
a
secretary
;
he
could
easily
get
a
man
who
would
do
half
his
work
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
save
him
more
effectually
,
and
you
need
only
help
him
in
light
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
think
of
that
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
in
a
tone
of
earnest
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
no
happiness
if
I
do
not
help
him
in
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
good
to
be
do
in
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
thing
I
desire
be
to
help
him
more
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
object
to
a
secretary
:
please
not
to
mention
that
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
now
I
know
your
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
hear
both
Mr.
Brooke
and
Sir
James
Chettam
express
the
same
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
"
but
they
do
not
understand
 
they
want
me
to
be
a
great
deal
on
horseback
,
and
have
the
garden
alter
and
new
conservatory
,
to
fill
up
my
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
could
understand
that
one
's
mind
have
other
want
<EOS>
,
"
she
add
,
rather
impatiently
 
"
besides
,
Mr.
Casaubon
can
not
bear
to
hear
of
a
secretary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mistake
be
excusable
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
old
day
I
use
to
hear
Mr.
Casaubon
speak
as
if
he
look
forward
to
have
a
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
hold
out
the
prospect
of
that
office
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
turn
out
to
be
 
not
good
enough
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
try
to
extract
out
of
this
an
excuse
for
her
husband
's
evident
repulsion
,
as
she
say
,
with
a
playful
smile
,
"
You
be
not
a
steady
worker
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Will
,
shake
his
head
backward
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
a
spirited
horse
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
old
irritable
demon
prompt
him
to
give
another
good
pinch
at
the
moth
-
wing
of
poor
Mr.
Casaubon
's
glory
,
he
go
on
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
see
since
that
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
like
any
one
to
overlook
his
work
and
know
thoroughly
what
he
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
doubtful
 
too
uncertain
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
good
for
much
,
but
he
dislike
me
because
I
disagree
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
will
be
not
without
his
intention
to
be
always
generous
,
but
our
tongue
be
little
trigger
which
have
usually
be
pull
before
general
intention
can
be
bring
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
too
intolerable
that
Casaubon
's
dislike
of
him
should
not
be
fairly
account
for
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
yet
when
he
have
speak
he
be
rather
uneasy
as
to
the
effect
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
be
strangely
quiet
 
not
immediately
indignant
,
as
she
have
be
on
a
like
occasion
in
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
cause
lie
deep
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
no
longer
struggle
against
the
perception
of
fact
,
but
adjust
herself
to
their
clear
perception
;
and
now
when
she
look
steadily
at
her
husband
's
failure
,
still
more
at
his
possible
consciousness
of
failure
,
she
seem
to
be
look
along
the
one
track
where
duty
become
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
Will
's
want
of
reticence
may
have
be
meet
with
more
severity
,
if
he
have
not
already
be
recommend
to
her
mercy
by
her
husband
's
dislike
,
which
must
seem
hard
to
her
till
she
see
well
reason
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
at
once
,
but
after
look
down
ruminatingly
she
say
,
with
some
earnestness
,
"
Mr.
Casaubon
must
have
overcome
his
dislike
of
you
so
far
as
his
action
be
concern
:
and
that
be
admirable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
have
show
a
sense
of
justice
in
family
matter
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
abominable
thing
that
my
grandmother
should
have
be
disinherit
because
she
make
what
they
call
a
mesalliance
,
though
there
be
nothing
to
be
say
against
her
husband
except
that
he
be
a
polish
refugee
who
give
lesson
for
his
bread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
know
all
about
her
!
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
she
bear
the
change
from
wealth
to
poverty
:
I
wonder
whether
she
be
happy
with
her
husband
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
much
about
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
only
that
my
grandfather
be
a
patriot
 
<EOS>
a
bright
fellow
 
could
speak
many
language
 
<EOS>
musical
 
get
his
bread
by
teach
all
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
die
rather
early
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
know
much
of
my
father
,
beyond
what
my
mother
tell
me
;
but
he
inherit
the
musical
talent
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
his
slow
walk
and
his
long
thin
hand
;
and
one
day
remain
with
me
when
he
be
lie
ill
,
and
I
be
very
hungry
,
and
have
only
a
little
bit
of
bread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
what
a
different
life
from
mine
!
<EOS>
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
keen
interest
,
clasp
her
hand
on
her
lap
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
have
too
much
of
everything
.
 
<EOS>
but
tell
me
how
it
be
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
could
not
have
know
about
you
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
my
father
have
make
himself
known
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
that
be
my
last
hungry
day
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
die
soon
after
,
and
my
mother
and
I
be
well
take
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
always
expressly
recognize
it
as
his
duty
to
take
care
of
us
because
of
the
harsh
injustice
which
have
be
show
to
his
mother
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
be
tell
you
what
be
not
new
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
his
inmost
soul
Will
be
conscious
of
wish
to
tell
Dorothea
what
be
rather
new
even
in
his
own
construction
of
thing
 
namely
,
that
Mr.
Casaubon
have
never
do
more
than
pay
a
debt
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
much
too
good
a
fellow
to
be
easy
under
the
sense
of
be
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
and
when
gratitude
have
become
a
matter
of
reason
there
be
many
way
of
escape
from
its
bond
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
answer
Dorothea
;
"
Mr.
Casaubon
have
always
avoid
dwell
on
his
own
honorable
action
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
feel
that
her
husband
's
conduct
be
depreciate
;
but
this
notion
of
what
justice
have
require
in
his
relation
with
Will
Ladislaw
take
strong
hold
on
her
mind
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
she
add
,
"
He
have
never
tell
me
that
he
support
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
still
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
she
die
by
an
accident
 
a
fall
 
four
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
my
mother
,
too
,
run
away
from
her
family
,
but
not
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
would
tell
me
anything
about
her
family
,
except
that
she
forsook
them
to
get
her
own
living
 
go
on
the
stage
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
dark
-
eyed
creature
,
with
crisp
ringlet
,
and
never
seem
to
be
get
old
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
come
of
rebellious
blood
on
both
side
,
"
Will
end
,
smile
brightly
at
Dorothea
,
while
she
be
still
look
with
serious
intentness
before
her
,
like
a
child
see
a
drama
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
face
,
too
,
break
into
a
smile
as
she
say
,
"
that
be
your
apology
,
I
suppose
,
for
have
yourself
be
rather
rebellious
;
I
mean
,
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
wish
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
remember
that
you
have
not
do
what
he
think
best
for
you

<EOS>
and
if
he
dislike
you
 
you
be
speak
of
dislike
<EOS>
a
little
while
ago
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
rather
say
,
if
he
have
show
any
painful
feeling
towards
you
,
you
must
consider
how
sensitive
he
have
become
from
the
wear
effect
of
study
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
"
she
continue
,
get
into
a
plead
tone
,
"
my
uncle
have
not
tell
you
how
serious
Mr.
Casaubon
's
illness
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
petty
of
us
who
be
well
and
can
bear
thing
,
to
think
much
of
small
offence
from
those
who
carry
a
weight
of
trial

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
teach
me
better
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
grumble
on
that
subject
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
gentleness
in
his
tone
which
come
from
the
unutterable
contentment
of
perceive
 
what
Dorothea
be
hardly
conscious
of
 
that
she
be
travel
into
the
remoteness
of
pure
pity
and
loyalty
towards
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
ready
to
adore
her
pity
and
loyalty
,
if
she
would
associate
himself
with
her
in
manifest
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
really
sometimes
be
a
perverse
fellow
,

he
go
on
,
"
but
I
will
never
again
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
do
or
say
what
you
would
disapprove

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
good
of
you

Dorothea
,
with
another
open
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
a
little
kingdom
then
,
where
I
shall
give
law
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
soon
go
away
,
out
of
my
rule
,
I
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
soon
be
tired
of
stay
at
the
Grange

<EOS>
"
that
be
a
point
I
want
to
mention
to
you
 
one
of
the
reason
why
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
propose
that
I
should
stay
in
this
neighborhood
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
buy
one
of
the
Middlemarch
newspaper
,
and
he
wish
me
to
conduct
that
,
and
also
to
help
him
in
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
not
that
be
a
sacrifice
of
high
prospect
for
you
?
"
say
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
;
but
I
have
always
be
blame
for
thinking
of
prospect
,
and
not
settle
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
something
offer
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
not
like
me
to
accept
it
,
I
will
give
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
would
rather
stay
in
this
part
of
the
country
than
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
belong
to
nobody
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
you
to
stay
very
much
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
at
once
,
as
simply
and
readily
as
she
have
speak
at
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
in
her
mind
at
the
moment
why
she
should
not
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
_
will
_
stay
,
"
say
Ladislaw
,
shake
his
head
backward
,
rise
and
go
towards
the
window
,
as
if
to
see
whether
the
rain
have
cease
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
next
moment
,
Dorothea
,
accord
to
a
habit
which
be
get
continually
strong
,
begin
to
reflect
that
her
husband
feel
differently
from
herself
,
and
she
color
deeply
under
the
double
embarrassment
of
have
express
what
may
be
in
opposition
to
her
husband
's
feeling
,
and
of
have
to
suggest
this
opposition
to
Will
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
not
turn
towards
her
,
and
this
make
it
easy
to
say
    
"
<EOS>
but
my
opinion
be
of
little
consequence
on
such
a
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
should
be
guide
by
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
without
thinking
of
anything
else
than
my
own
feeling
,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
real
question
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
now
occur
to
me
 
<EOS>
perhaps
Mr.
Casaubon
may
see
that
the
proposal
be
not
wise
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
not
wait
now
and
mention
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
wait
to
-
day
,
"
say
Will
,
inwardly
sear
by
the
possibility
that
Mr.
Casaubon
would
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
rain
be
quite
over
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Brooke
not
to
call
for
me
:
I
would
rather
walk
the
five
mile
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
strike
across
Halsell
Common
,
and
see
the
gleam
on
the
wet
grass
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
approach
her
to
shake
hand
quite
hurriedly
,
longing
but
not
dare
to
say
,
"
do
not
mention
the
subject
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
he
dare
not
,
could
not
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
ask
her
to
be
less
simple
and
direct
would
be
like
breathe
on
the
crystal
that
you
want
to
see
the
light
through
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
always
the
other
great
dread
 
of
himself
become
dimmed
and
forever
ray
-
shorn
in
her

"
I
wish
you
could
have
stay
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
a
touch
of
mournfulness
,
as
she
rise
and
put
out
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
have
her
think
which
she
do
not
like
to
express
:
 
<EOS>
Will
certainly
ought
to
lose
no
time
in
consult
Mr.
Casaubon
's
wish
,
but
for
her
to
urge
this
may
seem
an
undue
dictation
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
only
say
"
good
-
by
,
"
and
Will
quit
the
house
,
strike
across
the
field
so
as
not
to
run
any
risk
of
encounter
Mr.
Casaubon
's
carriage
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
appear
at
the
gate
until
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
that
be
an
unpropitious
hour
for
come
home
:
it
be
too
early
to
gain
the
moral
support
under
ennui
of
dress
his
person
for
dinner
,
and
too
late
to
undress
his
mind
of
the
day
's
frivolous
ceremony
and
affair
,
so
as
to
be
prepare
for
a
good
plunge
into
the
serious
business
of
study
.
 
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
he
usually
throw
into
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
library
,
and
allow
Dorothea
to
read
the
London
paper
to
him
,
close
his
eye
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
however
,
he
decline
that
relief
,
observe
that
he
have
already
have
too
many
public
detail
urge
upon
him
;
but
he
speak
more
cheerfully
than
usual
,
when
Dorothea
ask
about
his
fatigue
,
and
add
with
that
air
of
formal
effort
which
never
forsook
him
even
when
he
speak
without
his
waistcoat
and
cravat
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
the
gratification
of
meet
my
former
acquaintance
,
Dr.
Spanning
,
to
-
day
,
and
of
be
praise
by
one
who
be
himself
a
worthy
recipient
of
praise
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
very
handsomely
of
my
late
tractate
on
the
Egyptian
Mysteries
,
 
use
,
in
fact
,
term
which
it
would
not
become
me
to
repeat

"
 
<EOS>
in
utter
the
last
clause
,
Mr.
Casaubon
lean
over
the
elbow
of
his
chair
,
and
sway
his
head
up
and
down
,
apparently
as
a
muscular
outlet
instead
of
that
recapitulation
which
would
not
have
be
become

<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
you
have
have
that
pleasure

say
Dorothea

delight
to
see
her
husband
less
weary
than
usual
at
this
hour

<EOS>
"
before
you
come
I
have
be
regret
that
you
happen
to
be
out

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
so
,
my
dear

"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
throw
himself
backward
again

"
because
Mr.

have
be
here

he
have
mention
a
proposal
of
my
uncle

which
I
should
like
to
know
your
opinion
of
.
"
<EOS>
Her
husband
she
feel
be
really
concerned
in
this
question
.
 
<EOS>
even
with
her
ignorance
of
the
world
she
have
a
vague
impression
that
the
position
offer
to
Will
be
out
of
keep
with
his
family
connection
,
and
certainly
Mr.
Casaubon
have
a
claim
to
be
consult
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
,
but
merely
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
uncle
,
you
know
,
have
many
project
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
that
he
have
buy
one
of
the
Middlemarch
newspaper
,
and
he
have
ask
Mr.
Ladislaw
to
stay
in
this
neighborhood
and
conduct
the
paper
for
him
,
besides
help
him
in
other

Dorothea
look
at
her
husband
while
she
speak
,
but
he
have
at
first
blink
and
finally
close
his
eye
,
as
if
to
save
them
;
while
his
lip
become
more
tense
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
opinion
?
"
<EOS>
she
add
,
rather
timidly
,
after
a
slight
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mr.
Ladislaw
come
on
purpose
to
ask
my

say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
open
his
eye
narrowly
with
a
knife

edge
look
at
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
really
uncomfortable
on
the
point
he
inquire
about

she
only
become
a
little
more
serious
,

her

do
not
swerve

no

she
answer
immediately

"
he
do
not
say
that
he
come
to
ask
your

when
he
mention
the
proposal

he
of
course
expect
me
to
tell
you
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
that
you
may
feel
some
objection

certainly
a

be
very
useful

good

Mr.

He
have
be
blame
,
he
say
,
for
not
seek
something
of
that

he

no

<EOS>
Dorothea
feel
that
this
be
a
consideration
to
soften
her
husband

<EOS>
however
,
he
do
not
speak
,
and
she
presently
recur
to
Dr.
Spanning
and
the
Archdeacon
's
breakfast

there
be
no

<EOS>
the
next
morning

without

despatch
the

Dear
Mr.

<EOS>
(
he
have
always
before
address
him
as
"

:
     
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Casaubon
inform
me
that
a
proposal
have
be
make
to
you

and
(
accord
to
an
inference
by
no
means
stretch
)
have
on
your
part
be
in
some
degree
entertain
,
which
involve
your
residence
in
this
neighborhood
in
a
capacity
which
I
be
justified
in
say
touch
my
own
position
in
such
a
way
as
render
it
not
only
natural
and
warrantable
in
me
when
that
effect
be
view
under
the
influence
of
legitimate
feeling
,
but
incumbent
on
me
when
the
same
effect
be
consider
in
the
light
of
my
responsibility
,
to
state
at
once
that
your
acceptance
of
the
proposal
above
indicate
would
be
highly
offensive
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
some
claim
to
the
exercise
of
a
veto
here
,
<EOS>
would
not
,
I
believe
,
be
deny
by
any
reasonable

cognizant

relation

,
though
throw
into

be

annul
in
their

antecedent

<EOS>
I
will
not
here
make
reflection
on
any
person
's
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
me
to
point
out
to
yourself
that
there
be
certain
social
fitness
and
propriety
which
should
hinder
a
somewhat
near
relative
of
mine
from
become
any
wise
conspicuous
in
this
vicinity
in
a
status
not
only
much
beneath
my
own
,
but
associate
at
best
with
the
sciolism
of
literary
or
political
adventurer
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
the
contrary
issue
must
exclude
you
from
further
reception
at
my

<EOS>
meanwhile
Dorothea
's
mind
be
innocently
at
work
towards
the
further
embitterment
of
her
husband
;
dwelling
,
with
a
sympathy
that
grow
to
agitation
,
on
what
Will
have
tell
her
about
his
parent
and
grandparent
.
 
<EOS>
any
private
hour
in
her
day
be
usually
spend
in
her
blue
-
green
boudoir
,
and
she
have
come
to
be
very
fond
of
its
pallid
quaintness
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
outwardly
alter
there
;
but
while
the
summer
have
gradually
advance
over
the
western
field
beyond
the
avenue
of
elms
,
the
bare
room
have
gather
within
it
those
memory
of
an
inward
life
which
fill
the
air
as
with
a
cloud
of
good
or
bad
angel
,
the
invisible
yet
active
form
of
our
spiritual
triumph
or
our
spiritual
fall

<EOS>
She
have
be
so
use
to
struggle
for
and
to
find
resolve
in
look
along
the
avenue
towards
the
arch
of
western
light
that
the
vision
itself
have
gain
a
communicate
power
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
pale
stag
seem
to
have
remind
glance
and
to
mean
mutely
,
"
yes
,
we
know
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
group
of
delicately
touch
miniature
have
make
an
audience
as
of
being
no
longer
disturb
about
their
own
earthly
lot
,
but
still
humanly
interested
.
 
<EOS>
especially
the
mysterious
"
Aunt
Julia
"
about
whom
Dorothea
have
never
find
it
easy
to
question
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
since
her
conversation
with
Will
,
many
fresh
image
have
gather
round
that
Aunt
Julia
who
be
Will
's
grandmother
;
the
presence
of
that
delicate
miniature
,
<EOS>
so
like
a
living
face
that
she
know
,
help
to
concentrate
her
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
wrong
,
to
cut
off
the
girl
from
the
family
protection
and
inheritance
only
because
she
have
choose
a
man
who
be
poor
!
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
,
early
trouble
her
elder
with
question
about
the
fact
around
her
,
have
work
herself
into
some
independent
clearness
as
to
the
historical
,
political
reason
why
eld
son
have
superior
right
,
and
why
land
should
be
entail
:
those
reason
,
impress
her
with
a
certain
awe
,
may
be
weighty
than
she
know
,
but
here
be
a
question
of
tie
which
leave
them
uninfringed
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
daughter
whose
child
 
even
accord
to
the
ordinary
aping
of
aristocratic
institution
by
people
who
be
no
more
aristocratic
than
retire
grocer
,
and
who
have
no
more
land
to
"
keep
together
"
than
a
lawn
and
a
paddock
 
would
have
a
prior
claim
.
 
<EOS>
be
inheritance
a
question
of
like
or
of
responsibility
?
 
<EOS>
all
the
energy
of
Dorothea
's
nature
go
on
the
side
of
responsibility
 
the
fulfilment
of
claim
found
on
our
own
deed
,
such
as
marriage
and
parentage
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
she
say
to
herself
,
that
Mr.
Casaubon
have
a
debt
to
the
Ladislaws
 
that
he
have
to
pay
back
what
the
Ladislaws
have
be
wrong
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
she
begin
to
think
of
her
husband
's
will
,
which
have
be
make
at
the
time
of
their
marriage
,
leave
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
her
,
with
proviso
in
case
of
her
have
child
.
 
<EOS>
that
ought
to
be
alter
;
and
no
time
ought
to
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
this
very
question
which
have
just
arise
about
Will
Ladislaw
's
occupation
,
be
the
occasion
for
place
thing
on
a
new
,
right
footing
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
she
feel
sure
,
accord
to
all
his
previous
conduct
,
would
be
ready
to
take
the
just
view
,
if
she
propose
it
 
<EOS>
she
,
in
whose
interest
an
unfair
concentration
of
the
property
have
be
urge
.
 
<EOS>
His
sense
of
right
have
surmount
and
would
continue
to
surmount
anything
that
may
be
call
antipathy
.
 
<EOS>
She
suspect
that
her
uncle
's
scheme
be
disapprove
by
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
this
make
it
seem
all
the
more
opportune
that
a
fresh
understanding
should
be
begin
,
so
that
instead
of
Will
's
start
penniless
and
accept
the
first
function
that
offer
itself
,
he
should
find
himself
in
possession
of
a
rightful
income
which
should
be
pay
by
her
husband
during
his
life
,
and
,
by
an
immediate
alteration
of
the
will
,
should
be
secure
at
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
vision
of
all
this
as
what
ought
to
be
do
seem
to
Dorothea
like
a
sudden
letting
in
of
daylight
,
wake
her
from
her
previous
stupidity
and
incurious
self
-
absorb
ignorance
about
her
husband
's
relation
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
have
refuse
Mr.
Casaubon
's
future
aid
on
a
ground
that
no
longer
appear
right
to
her
;
and
Mr.
Casaubon
have
never
himself
see
fully
what
be
the
claim
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
!
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
great
strength
of
his
character
lie
here
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
we
do
with
our
money
?
 
<EOS>
We
make
no
use
of
half
of
our
income
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
money
buy
me
nothing
but
an
uneasy
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
peculiar
fascination
for
Dorothea
in
this
division
of
property
intend
for
herself
,
and
always
regard
by
her
as
excessive
.
<EOS>
She
be
blind
,
you
see
,
to
many
thing
obvious
to
other
 
likely
to
tread
in
the
wrong
place
,
as
Celia
have
warn
her
;
yet
her
blindness
to
whatever
do
not
lie
in
her
own
pure
purpose
carry
her
safely
by
the
side
of
precipice
where
vision
would
have
be
perilous
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
the
thought
which
have
gather
vividness
in
the
solitude
of
her
boudoir
occupy
her
incessantly
through
the
day
on
which
Mr.
Casaubon
have
send
his
letter
to
Will
.
 
<EOS>
everything
seem
hindrance
to
her
till
she
could
find
an
opportunity
of
open
her
heart
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
preoccupied
mind
all
subject
be
to
be
approach
gently
,
and
she
have
never
since
his
illness
lose
from
her
consciousness
the
dread
of
agitate
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
young
ardor
be
set
brood
over
the
conception
of
a
prompt
deed
,
the
deed
itself
seem
to
start
forth
with
independent
life
,
master
ideal
obstacle
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
pass
in
a
sombre
fashion
,
not
unusual
,
though
Mr.
Casaubon
be
perhaps
unusually
silent
;
but
there
be
hour
of
the
night
which
may
be
count
on
as
opportunity
of
conversation
;
for
Dorothea
,
when
aware
of
her
husband
's
sleeplessness
,
have
establish
a
habit
of
rise
,
light
a
candle
,
and
read
him
to
sleep
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
night
she
be
from
the
begin
sleepless
,
excite
by
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
He
sleep
as
usual
for
a
few
hour
,
but
she
have
rise
softly
and
have
sit
in
the
darkness
for
nearly
an
hour
before
he
say
    
<EOS>
"
Dorothea
,
since
you
be
up
,
will
you
light
a
candle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
feel
ill
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
be
her
first
question
,
as
she
obey
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
at
all
;
but
I
shall
be
oblige
,
since
you
be
up
,
if
you
will
read
me
a
few
page
of
Lowth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
talk
to
you
a
little
instead
?
"
say
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
about
money
all
day
 
that
I
have
always
have
too
much
,
and
especially
the
prospect
of
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
,
my
dear
Dorothea
,
be
providential
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
one
have
too
much
in
consequence
of
other
be
wrong
,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
divine
voice
which
tell
us
to

I
have
be
lead
to
think
about
your
aunt
Julia

how
she

leave
in
poverty
only
because
she

a
poor
man

an
act

be
not
disgraceful

not

It

on

ground

I
know

that
you
educate
Mr.

provide
for
his
mother

<EOS>
Dorothea
wait
a
few
moment
for
some
answer
that
would
help
her
onward
.
 
<EOS>
none
come
,
and
her
next
word
seem
the
more
forcible
to
her
,
fall
clear
upon
the
dark
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
surely
we
should
regard
his
claim
as
a
much
great
one
,
even
to
the
half
of
that
property
which
I
know
that
you
have
destine
for
me
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
ought
at
once
to
be
provide
for
on
that
understanding
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
right
that
he
should
be
in
the
dependence
of
poverty
while
we
be
rich

<EOS>
and
if
there
be
any
objection
to
the
proposal
he
mention
,
the
give
him
his
true
place

his
true
share
would
set
aside
any
motive

it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Ladislaw
have
probably
be
speak
to
you
on
this
subject

say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
a
certain
bite
quickness
not

to
him

no

Dorothea

earnestly

<EOS>

how
can
you
imagine
it

it
seem

me
clear
that
more
than
that

I

speak
about

<EOS>
there
be
a
perceptible
pause
before
Mr.

not
quickly

before

with
a
still
more
biting

no

It

<EOS>
Poor

darkness

a
tumult
of
conflict
emotion

<EOS>
Alarm
at
the
possible
effect
on

of
her
husband
's
strongly
manifest
anger

would
have
check
any
expression

"
DEAR
MR

<EOS>
CASAUBON
,
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
all
due
consideration
to
your
letter
of
yesterday
,
but
I
be
unable
to
take
precisely
your
view
of
our
mutual
position
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
full
acknowledgment
of
your
generous
conduct
to
me
in
the
past
,
I
must
still
maintain
that
an
obligation
of
this
kind
can
not
fairly
fetter
me
as
you
appear
to
expect
that
it
should
.
<EOS>
grant
that
a
benefactor
's
wish
may
constitute
a
claim
;
there
must
always
be
a
reservation
as
to
the
quality
of
those
wish
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
possibly
clash
with
more
imperative
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
or
a
benefactor
's
veto
may
impose
such
a
negation
on
a
man
's
life
that
the
consequent
blank
may
be
more
cruel
than
the
benefaction
be
generous
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
merely
use
strong
illustration
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
present
case
I
be
unable
to
take
your
view
of
the
bearing
which
my
acceptance
of
occupation
 
not
enrich
certainly
,
but
not
dishonorable
 
will
have
on
your
own
position
which
seem
to
me
too
substantial
to
be
affect
in
that
shadowy
manner
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
I
do
not
believe
that
any
change
in
our
relation
will
occur
(
certainly
none
have
yet
occur
)
which
can
nullify
the
obligation
impose
on
me
by
the
past
,
pardon
me
for
not
see
that
those
obligation
should
restrain
me
from
use
the
ordinary
freedom
of
live
where
I
choose
,
and
maintain
myself
by
any
lawful
occupation
I
may
choose
.
 
<EOS>
regret
that
there
exist
this
difference
between
us
as
to
a
relation
in
which
the
conferring
of
benefit
have
be
entirely
on
your
side

<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
feel
(
and
must
not
we
,
be
impartial
,
feel
with
him
a
little
?
)
<EOS>
that
no
man
have
juster
cause
for
disgust
and
suspicion
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Ladislaw
,
he
be
sure
,
mean
to
defy
and
annoy
him
,
mean
to
win
Dorothea
's
confidence
and
sow
her
mind
with
disrespect
,
and
perhaps
aversion
,
towards
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
some
motive
beneath
the
surface
have
be
need
to
account
for
Will
's
sudden
change
of
course
in
reject
Mr.
Casaubon
's
aid
and
quit
his
travel
;
and
this
defiant
determination
to
fix
himself
in
the
neighborhood
by
take
up
something
so
much
at
variance
with
his
former
choice
as
Mr.
Brooke
's
Middlemarch
project
,
reveal
clearly
enough
that
the
undeclared
motive
have
relation
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
not
for
one
moment
do
Mr.
Casaubon
suspect
Dorothea
of
any
doubleness
:
he
have
no
suspicion
of
her
,
but
he
have
(
what
be
little
less
uncomfortable
)
<EOS>
the
positive
knowledge
that
her
tendency
to
form
opinion
about
her
husband
's
conduct
be
accompany
with
a
disposition
to
regard
Will
Ladislaw
favorably
and
be
influence
by
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
His
own
proud
reticence
have
prevent
him
from
ever
be
undeceived
in
the
supposition
that
Dorothea
have
originally
ask
her
uncle
to
invite
Will
to
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
on
receive
Will
's
letter
,
Mr.
Casaubon
have
to
consider
his
duty
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
be
easy
to
call
his
action
anything
else
than
duty
;
but
in
this
case
,
contend
motive
thrust
him
back
into
negation
.
  
<EOS>
Should
he
apply
directly
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
demand
of
that
troublesome
gentleman
to
revoke
his
proposal
?
 
<EOS>
or
should
he
consult
Sir
James
Chettam
,
and
get
him
to
concur
in
remonstrance
against
a
step
which
touch
the
whole
family

<EOS>
in
either
case
Mr.
Casaubon
be
aware
that
failure
be
just
as
probable
as
success
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
mention
Dorothea
's
name
in
the
matter
,
and
without
some
alarm
urgency
Mr.

be
as
likely
as
not

up
by

credit

I
have
put
my

<EOS>
and
Mr.
Casaubon
shrink
nervously
from
communicate
on
the
subject
with
Sir
James
Chettam
,
between
whom
and
himself
there
have
never
be
any
cordiality
,
and
who
would
immediately
think
of
Dorothea
without
any
mention
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
be
distrustful
of
everybody
's
feeling
towards
him
,
especially
as
a
husband
.
 
<EOS>
to
let
any
one
suppose
that
he
be
jealous
would
be
to
admit
their
(
suspect
)
view
of
his
disadvantage
:
to
let
them
know
that
he
do
not
find
marriage
particularly
blissful
would
imply
his
conversion
to
their
(
probably
)
early
disapproval
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
as
bad
as
let
Carp
,
and
Brasenose
generally
,
know
how
backward
he
be
in
organize
the
matter
for
his

key

<EOS>
all
through
his

Mr.

even
to
himself

sore

doubt

jealousy

on
the
most
delicate
of
all

doubly

<EOS>
thus
Mr.

remain
proudly

bitterly
silent

he
have
forbid

she

trodden

she
be
always
attentive

very
polite
if
she
have
to
decline
their
advance

<EOS>
Will
follow
her
only
with
his
eye
and
say
,
"
I
presume
you
know
that
Mr.

have
forbid
me
to
go
to
his

<EOS>
"
no

I

after

moment

pause

<EOS>
She
be
evidently
much
move

<EOS>
"
I
be
very
,
very
sorry

she
add

mournfully

<EOS>
She
be
think
of
what
Will
have
no
knowledge
of
 
the
conversation
between
her
and
her
husband
in
the
darkness

and
she
be
anew
smite
with
hopelessness
that
she
could
influence
Mr.

's
action
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
marked
expression
of
her
sorrow
convince
Will
that
it
be
not
all
give
to
him
personally
,
and
that
Dorothea
have
not
be
visit
by
the
idea
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
dislike
and
jealousy
of
him
turn
upon
herself
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
an
odd
mixture
of
delight
and
vexation
:
of
delight
that
he
could
dwell
and
be
cherish
in
her
thought
as
in
a
pure
home
,
without
suspicion
and
without
stint
 
of
vexation
because
he
be
of
too
little
account
with
her
,
be
not
formidable
enough
,
be
treat
with
an
unhesitating
benevolence
which
do
not
flatter
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
dread
of
any
change
in
Dorothea
be
strong
than
his
discontent
,
and
he
begin
to
speak
again
in
a
tone
of
mere
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Casaubon
's
reason
be
,
his
displeasure
at
my
take
a
position
here
<EOS>
which
he
consider
unsuited
to
my
rank
as
his
cousin

I
have
tell
him
that
I

not

It

ridiculous

She

altogether
in

It

she

,
with
a
tremulousness
not

in

I

to

Will
offer
to
tell
Mr.

who
presently
come
and
say
that
he
would
step
into
the
carriage
and
go
with
Dorothea
as
far
as
Dagley
's
,
to
speak
about
the
small
delinquent
who
have
be
catch
with
the
leveret

<EOS>
Dorothea
renew
the
subject
of
the
estate
as
they
drive
along
,
but
Mr.
Brooke
,
not
be
take
unaware
,
get
the
talk
under
his
own
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chettam
,
now
,
"
he
reply
;
"
he
find
fault
with
me
,
my
dear
;
but
I
should
not
preserve
my
game
if
it
be
not
for
Chettam
,
and
he
can
not
say
that
that
expense
be
for
the
sake
of
the
tenant
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
against
my
feeling
:
 
poaching
,
now
,
if
you
come
to
look
into
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
of
get
up
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
not
long
ago
,
Flavell
,
the
Methodist
preacher
,
be
bring
up
for
knock
down
a
hare
that
come
across
his
path
when
he
and
his
wife
be
walk
out
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pretty
quick
,
and
knock
it
on
the
neck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
brutal
,
I
think
,
"
say
Dorothea
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
now
,
it
seem
rather
black
to
me
,
I
confess
,
in
a
Methodist
preacher
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
and
Johnson
say
,
"
You
may
judge
what
a
_
hypocrite
<EOS>
_
he
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
upon
my
word
,
I
think
Flavell
look
very
little
like
'
the
high
style
of
man
'
 
as
somebody
call
the
christian
 
Young
,
the
poet
Young
<EOS>
,
I
think
 
you
know
Young
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
now
,
Flavell
in
his
shabby
black
gaiter
,
plead
that
he
think
the
Lord
have
send
him
and
his
wife
a
good
dinner
,
and
he
have
a
right
to
knock
it
down
,
though
not
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
Lord
,
as
Nimrod
be
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
be
rather
comic
:
fielding
would
have
make
something
of
it
 
or
Scott
,
now
 
Scott
may
have
work
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
but
really
,
when
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
I
could
not
help
like
that
the
fellow
should
have
a
bit
of
hare
to
say
grace
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
a
matter
of
prejudice
 
<EOS>
prejudice
with
the
law
on
its
side
,
you
know
 
about
the
stick
and
the
gaiter
,
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
do
not
do
to
reason
about
thing
;
and
law
be
law
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
get
Johnson
to
be
quiet
,
and
I
hush
the
matter
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Chettam
would
not
have
be
more
severe
,
and
yet
he
come
down
on
me
as
if
I
be
the
hard
man
in
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
we
be
at
Dagley
's

<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
get
down
at
a
farmyard
-
gate
,
and
Dorothea
drive
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
much
ugly
thing
will
look
when
we
only
suspect
that
we
be
blame
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
even
our
own
person
in
the
glass
be
apt
to
change
their
aspect
for
us
after
we
have
hear
some
frank
remark
on
their
less
admirable
point
;
and
on
the
other
hand
it
be
astonish
how
pleasantly
conscience
take
our
encroachment
on
those
who
never
complain
or
have
nobody
to
complain
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Dagley
's
homestead
never

look
so
dismal

Mr.

as
it
do
today

with
his

the

there

.
 
<EOS>
but
these
troublesome
association
be
just
now
strongly
present
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
spoil
the
scene
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Dagley
himself
make
a
figure
in
the
landscape
,
carry
a
pitchfork
and
wear
his
milking
-
hat
 
a
very
old
beaver
flatten
in
front
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
and
breech
be
the
good
he
have
,
and
he
would
not
have
be
wear
them
on
this
weekday
occasion
if
he
have
not
be
to
market
and
return
later
than
usual
,
have
give
himself
the
rare
treat
of
dining
at
the
public
table
of
the
Blue
Bull
.
<EOS>
how
he
come
to
fall
into
this
extravagance
would
perhaps
be
matter
of
wonderment
to
himself
on
the
morrow
;
but
before
dinner
something
in
the
state
of
the
country
,
a
slight
pause
in
the
harvest
before
the
Far
Dips
be
cut
,
the
story
about
the
new
King
and
the
numerous
handbill
on
the
wall
,
have
seem
to
warrant
a
little
recklessness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
maxim
about
Middlemarch
,
and
regard
as
self
-
evident
,
that
good
meat
should
have
good
drink
,
which
last
Dagley
interpret
as
plenty
of
table
ale
<EOS>
well
follow
up
by
rum
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
these
liquor
have
so
far
truth
in
them
that
they
be
not
false
enough
to
make
poor
Dagley
seem
merry
:
they
only
make
his
discontent
less
tongue
-
tie
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
also
take
too
much
in
the
shape
of
muddy
political
talk
,
a
stimulant
dangerously
disturbing
to
his
farming
conservatism
,
which
consist
in
hold
that
whatever
be
,
be
bad
,
and
any
change
be
likely
to
be
bad
.
<EOS>
He
be
flush
,
and
his
eye
have
a
decidedly
quarrelsome
stare
as
he
stand
still
grasp
his
pitchfork
,
while
the
landlord
approach
with
his
easy
shuffling
walk
,
one
hand
in
his
trouser
-
pocket
and
the
other
swinging
round
a
thin
walking
-
stick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dagley
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
begin
Mr.
Brooke
,
conscious
that
he
be
go
to
be
very
friendly
about
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

a
good
feller

be
I

<EOS>
Thank
ye
,
sir
,
thank
ye

"
say
Dagley
,
with
a
loud
snarling
irony
which
make
Fag
the
sheep
-
dog
stir
from
his
seat
and
prick
his
ear
;
but
see
Monk
enter
the
yard
after
some
outside
loitering
,
Fag
seat
himself
again
in
an
attitude
of
observation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
I
be
a
good
feller

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
reflect
that
it
be
market
-
day
,
and
that
his
worthy
tenant
have
probably
be
dine
,
but
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
go
on
,
since
he
could
take
the
precaution
of
repeat
what
he
have
to
say
to
Mrs.
Dagley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your

strike
his

into

at

action
Monk
begin
to
bark
loudly

it

a
moment
for

to
escape

<EOS>
He
walk
out
of
the
yard
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
in
some
amazement
at
the
novelty
of
his
situation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
insult
on
his
own
land
before
,
and
have
be
incline
to
regard
himself
as
a
general
favorite
<EOS>
(
we
be
all
apt
to
do
so

when
we
think
of
our
own
amiability
more
than
of
what
other
people
be
likely

<EOS>
when
he
have
quarrel
with
Caleb
Garth
twelve
year
before

think
that

would

at

landlord

take
everything
into

<EOS>
some
who
follow
the
narrative
of
his
experience
may
wonder
at
the
midnight
darkness
of
Mr.
Dagley
;
but
nothing
be
easy
in
those
time
than
for
an
hereditary
farmer
of
his
grade
to
be
ignorant
,
in
spite
somehow
of
have
a
rector
in
the
twin
parish
who
be
a
gentleman
to
the
backbone
,
a
curate
nearer
at
hand
who
preach
more
learnedly
than
the
rector
,
a
landlord
who
have
go
into
everything
,
especially
fine
art
and
social
improvement
,
and
all
the
light
of
Middlemarch
only
three
mile
off
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
facility
with
which
mortal
escape
knowledge
,
try
an
average
acquaintance
in
the
intellectual
blaze
of
London
,
and
consider
what
that
eligible
person
for
a
dinner
-
party
would
have
be
if
he
have
learn
scant
skill
in
"
sum
"
from
the
parish
-
clerk
of
Tipton
,
and
read
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
with
immense
difficulty
,
because
such
name
as
Isaiah
or
Apollos
remain
unmanageable
after
twice
spelling
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dagley
read
a
few
verse
sometimes
on
a
Sunday
evening
,
and
the
world
be
at
least
not
dark
to
him
than
it
have
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
some
thing
he
know
thoroughly
,
namely
,
the
slovenly
habit
of
farming
,
and
the
awkwardness
of
weather
,
stock
and
crop
,
at
Freeman
's
end
 
so
call
apparently
by
way
of
sarcasm
,
to
imply
that
a
man
be
free
to
quit
it
if
he
choose
,
but
that
there
be
no
earthly
"
beyond

open
to
him

Wise
in

pleased

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
manner
could
have
be
less
like
that
of
Punch
triumphant
than
Caleb
's
,
but
his
talent
do
not
lie
in
find
phrase
,
though
he
be
very
particular
about
his
letter
-
writing
,
and
regard
his
wife
as
a
treasury
of
correct
language
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
almost
an
uproar
among
the
child
now
,
and
Mary
hold
up
the
cambric
embroidery
towards
her
mother
entreatingly
,
that
it
may
be
put
out
of
reach
while
the

drag
her
into

dance

<EOS>
Mrs.
Garth
,
in
placid
joy
,
begin
to
put
the
cup

plate
together
,
while
Caleb
push
his
chair
from
the
table
,
as
if
he
be
go
to
move
to
the
desk
,
still
sit
hold
his
letter
in
his
hand
and
look
on
the
ground
meditatively
,
stretch
out
the
finger
of
his
left
hand
,
accord
to
a
mute
language
of
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
    
"
It
be
a
thousand
pity
Christy
do
not
take
to

Susan

I
shall
want
help

I

make
up

<EOS>
He
fall
into
meditation
and
finger
-
rhetoric
again
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
continue
:
"
I
shall
make
Brooke
have
new
agreement
with
the
tenant
,
and
I
shall
draw
up
a
rotation
of
crop
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
lay
a
wager
we
can
get
fine
brick
out
of
the
clay
at
Bott
's
corner
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
look
into
that
:
it
would
cheapen
the
repair
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
bit
of
work
,
Susan

<EOS>
a
man
without
a
family
would
be
glad
to
do
it
for
nothing

"
  
<EOS>
"
mind
you
do
not
,
though
,
"
say
his
wife
,
lift
up
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
fine
thing
to
come
to
a
man
when
he
be
see
into
the
nature
of
business
:
to
have
the
chance
of
get
a
bit
of
the
country
into
good
fettle
,
as
they
say
,
and
put
man
into
the
right
way
with
their
farming
,
and
get
a
bit
of
good
contriving
and
solid
building
do
 
that
those
who
be
live
and
those
who
come
after
will
be
the
well
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
have
it
than
a
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
it
the
most
honorable
work
that
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
Caleb
lay
down
his
letter
,
thrust
his
finger
between
the
button
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
sit
upright
,
but
presently
proceed
with
some
awe
in
his
voice
and
move
his
head
slowly
aside
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
gift
of
God
,
Susan

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
it
be
,
Caleb
,
"
say
his
wife
,
with
answer
fervor
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
it
will
be
a
blessing
to
your
child
to
have
have
a
father
who
do
such
work
:
a
father
whose
good
work
remain
though
his
name
may
be
forget
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
any
more
to
him
then
about
the
pay
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
when
Caleb
,
rather
tired
with
his
day
's
work
,
be
seat
in
silence
with
his
pocket
-
book
open
on
his
knee
,
while
Mrs.
Garth
and
Mary
be
at
their
sewing
,
and
Letty
in
a
corner
be
whisper
a
dialogue
with
her
doll
,
Mr.
Farebrother
come
up
the
orchard
walk
,
divide
the
bright
August
light
and
shadow
with
the
tufted
grass
and
the
apple
-
tree
bough
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
that
he
be
fond
of
his
parishioner
the
Garths
,
and
have
think
Mary
worth
mention
to
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
the
full
the
clergyman
's
privilege
of
disregard
the
Middlemarch
discrimination
of
rank
,
and
always
tell
his
mother
that
Mrs.
Garth
be
more
of
a
lady
than
any
matron
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
you
see
,
he
spend
his
evening
at
the
Vincys
'
,
where
the
matron
,
though
less
of
a
lady
,
preside
over
a
well
-
light
drawing
-
room
and
whist
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
day
human
intercourse
be
not
determine
solely
by
respect
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Vicar
do
heartily
respect
the
Garths
,
and
<EOS>
a
visit
from
him
be
no
surprise
to
that
family
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
account
for
it
even
while
he
be
shake
hand
,
by
say
,
"
I
come
as
an
envoy
,
Mrs.
Garth
:
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
Garth
on
behalf
of
Fred
Vincy

<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
poor
fellow
,
"
he
continue
,
as
he
seat
himself
and
look
round
with
his
bright
glance
at
the
three
who
be
listen
to
him
,
"
he
have
take
me
into
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
heart
beat
rather
quickly
:
she
wonder
how
far
Fred
's
confidence
have
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
see
the
lad
for
month
,
"
say
Caleb
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
think
what
be
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
away
on
a
visit
,
"
say
the
Vicar
,
"
because
home
be
a
little
too
hot
for
him
,
and
Lydgate
tell
his
mother
that
the
poor
fellow
must
not
begin
to
study
yet
.
 
<EOS>
but
yesterday
he
come
and
pour
himself
out
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
he
do
,
because
I
have
see
him
grow
up
from
a
youngster
of
fourteen
,
and
I
be
so
much
at
home
in
the
house
that
the
child
be
like
nephew
and
niece
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
difficult
case
to
advise
upon
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
ask
me
to
come
and
tell
you
that
he
be
go
away
,
and
that
he
be
so
miserable
about
his
debt
to
you
,
and
his
inability
to
pay
,
that
he
can
not
bear
to
come
himself
even
to
bid
you
good
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
it
do
not
signify
a
farthing
,
"
say
Caleb
,
wave
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
have
the
pinch
and
have
get
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
go
to
be
as
rich
as
a
Jew

<EOS>
"
  
"
which
mean
,
"
say
Mrs.
Garth
,
smile
at
the
Vicar
,
"
that
we
be
go
to
have
enough
to
bring
up
the
boy
well
and
to
keep
Mary
at
home

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
treasure
-
trove
?
"
say
Mr.
Farebrother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
be
agent
for
two
estate
,
Freshitt
and
Tipton
;
and
perhaps
for
a
pretty
little
bit
of
land
in
Lowick
<EOS>
besides
:
it
be
all
the
same
family
connection
,
and
employment
spread
like
water
if
it
be
once
set
go

<EOS>
It
make
me
very
happy

Mr.
Farebrother

here
Caleb
throw
back
his
head
a
little
,
and
spread
his
arm
on
the
elbow
of
his
chair
 
"
that
I
have
get
an
opportunity
again
with
the
letting
of
the
land
,
and
carry
out
a
notion
or
two
with
improvement

<EOS>
It
be
a
most
uncommonly
cramp
thing
,
as
I
have
often
tell
Susan
,
to
sit
on
horseback
and
look
over
the
hedge
at
the
wrong
thing

what
people
do
who
go
into
politic
<EOS>
I
can
not

it

It

volunteer
so
long
a
speech

his
happiness
have
the

his

bright

the

come
without

I
congratulate
you
heartily

the
Vicar

<EOS>
"
this
be
the
good
sort
of
news
I
could
have
have
to
carry
to

a
good
deal
on
the
injury

rob
you

you

I
wish
Fred
be
not
such
an
idle
dog

he
have
some
very
good
point

his

be
a

hard
upon
him

where
be
he
go

He
mean
to
try
again
for
his

go
up

study
before

I
have
advise
him
to
do
that

<EOS>
I
do
not
urge
him
to
enter
the
Church
 
on
the
contrary

<EOS>

if
he
will
go
and
work
so
as
to
pass
,
that
will
be
some
guarantee
that
he
have
energy

a
will

he
be
quite
at
sea

he
do
not
know
what
else
to
do

<EOS>
so
far
he
will
please
his

I
have
promise
in

try

reconcile
Vincy
to
his

Fred
say
frankly
he

anything

as
to
Fred

it

only
fair
he
should
be
excuse
a
little
:
<EOS>
old
Featherstone
's
delusive
behavior
do
help
to
spoil
him

<EOS>
there
be
something
quite
diabolical
in
not
leave
him
a

after
all

but
Fred
have
the
good
taste
not

dwell
on
that

what
he
care
most
about

offend

I
shall
be
ready

good

at
this
point

we

forgive
young

and
as
you
say

Mr.

there
be
the
very
devil
in
that
old
man

<EOS>
now
Mary
be
go
out
,
I
must
tell
you
a
thing
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
know
to
Susan

me

you
will
not
tell
it
again

<EOS>
the
old
scoundrel
want
Mary
to
burn
one
of
the
will
the
very
night
he
die

sit
up
with
him

herself

her
a
sum

in

him

could
do
no

would
not

handle
his
iron
chest

so
on

<EOS>
now
,
you
see
,
the
will
he
want
burn
<EOS>
be
this
last

so
that
if
Mary
have
do
what
he
want

Fred
Vincy
would
have
have
ten
thousand

the
old

do
turn

him
at

she
could
not

it
 
<EOS>
she
be
in
the
right
to
do
what
she
do

she
feel

much
as

down
somebody

break
it
against

you
there

Mr.

for
some
reason
seem
more
inclined

ruminate

one
could
hardly

mention

well

will
not
tell
Fred
.

<EOS>
"
certainly
not

<EOS>
but
I
shall
carry
the
other
good
news
 
that
you
can
afford
the
loss
he
cause
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
leave
the
house
soon
after
,
and
see
Mary
in
the
orchard
with
Letty
,
go
to
say
good
-
by
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
pretty
picture
in
the
western
light
which
bring
out
the
brightness
of
the
apple
on
the
old
scant
-
leave
bough
 
Mary
in
her
lavender
gingham
and
black
ribbon
hold
a
basket
,
while
Letty
in
her
well
-
wear
nankin
pick
up
the
fall
apple
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
want
to
know
more
particularly
how
Mary
look
,
ten
to
one
you
will
see
a
face
like
her
in
the
crowded
street
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
be
there
on
the
watch
:
she
will
not
be
among
those
daughter
of
Zion
who
be
haughty
,
and
walk
with
stretch
-
out
neck
and
wanton
eye
,
mince
as
they
go
:
let
all
those
pass
,
and
fix
your
eye
on
some
small
plump
brownish
person
of
firm
but
quiet
carriage
,
who
look
about
her
,
but
do
not
suppose
that
anybody
be
look
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
a
broad
face
and
square
brow
,
well
-
mark
eyebrow
and
curly
dark
hair
,
a
certain
expression
of
amusement
in
her
glance
which
her
mouth
keep
the
secret
of
,
and
for
the
rest
feature
entirely
insignificant
 
take
that
ordinary
but
not
disagreeable
person
for
a
portrait
of
Mary
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
make
her
smile
,
she
would
show
you
perfect
little
tooth
;
if
you
make
her
angry
,
she
would
not
raise
her
voice
,
but
would
probably
say
one
of
the
bitter
thing
you
have
ever
taste
the
flavor
of
;
if
you
do
her
a
kindness
,
she
would
never
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
admire
the
keen
-
faced
handsome
little
Vicar
in
his
well
-
brush
threadbare
clothe
more
than
any
man
she
have
have
the
opportunity
of
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
never
hear
him
say
a
foolish
thing
,
though
she
know
that
he
do
unwise
one
;
and
perhaps
foolish
saying
be
more
objectionable
to
her
than
any
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
unwise
doing
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
it
be
remarkable
that
the
actual
imperfection
of
the
Vicar
's
clerical
character
never
seem
to
call
forth
the
same
scorn
and
dislike
which
she
show
beforehand
for
the
predict
imperfection
of
the
clerical
character
sustain
by
Fred
Vincy
.
 
<EOS>
these
irregularity
of
judgment
,
I
imagine
,
be
find
even
in
riper
mind
than
Mary
Garth
's
:
our
impartiality
be
keep
for
abstract
merit
and
demerit
,
which
none
of
us
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
Will
any
one
guess
towards
which
of
those
widely
different
man
<EOS>
Mary
have
the
peculiar
woman
's
tenderness
?
 
<EOS>
the
one
she
be
most
inclined
to
be
severe
on
,
or
the
contrary
?
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
message
for
your
old
playfellow
,
Miss
Garth
?
"
say
the
Vicar
,
as
he
take
a
fragrant
apple
from
the
basket
which
she
hold
towards
him
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
something
to
soften
down
that
harsh
judgment
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
straight
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Mary
,
shake
her
head
,
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
say
that
he
would
not
be
ridiculous
as
a
clergyman

I
must
say
that
he
would
be
something
bad
than
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
that
he
be
go
away
to
work

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
on
the
other
hand

I
be
very
glad
to
hear
that

not
go
away

work

<EOS>
My
mother
,
I
be
sure
,
will
be
all
the
happy
if
you
will
come
to
see
her
at
the
vicarage
:
you
know
she
be
fond
of
have
young
people
to
talk
to
,
and
she
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
about
old
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
really
be
do
a
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
if
I
may
,
"
say
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
everything
seem
too
happy
for
me
all
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
always
be
part
of
my
life
to
long
for
home
,
and
lose
that
grievance
make
me
feel
rather
empty
<EOS>
:
I
suppose
it
serve
instead
of
sense
to
fill
up
my
mind
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
go
with
you
,
Mary
?
"
<EOS>
whisper
Letty
 
<EOS>
a
most
inconvenient
child
,
who
listen
to
everything
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
make
exultant
by
have
her
chin
pinch
and
her
cheek
kiss
by
Mr.
Farebrother
 
an
incident
which
she
narrate
to
her
mother
and
father
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
Vicar
walk
to
Lowick
,
any
one
watch
him
closely
may
have
see
him
twice
shrug
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
the
rare
Englishmen
who
have
this
gesture
be
never
of
the
heavy
type
 
for
fear
of
any
lumber
instance
to
the
contrary
,
I
will
say
,
hardly
ever
;
they
have
usually
a
fine
temperament
and
much
tolerance
towards
the
small
error
of
man
(
themselves
inclusive
)
.
<EOS>
the
Vicar
be
hold
an
inward
dialogue
in
which
he
tell
himself
that
there
be
probably
something
more
between
Fred
and
Mary
Garth
than
the
regard
of
old
playfellow
,
and
reply
with
a
question
whether
that
bit
of
womanhood
be
not
a
great
deal
too
choice
for
that
crude
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
the
rejoinder
to
this
be
the
first
shrug
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
laugh
at
himself
for
be
likely
to
have
feel
jealous
,
as
if
he
have
be
a
man
able
to
marry
,
which
,
add
he
,
it
be
as
clear
as
any
balance
-
sheet
that
I
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
follow
the
second
shrug
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
two
man
,
so
different
from
each
other
,
see
in
this
"
brown
patch
,
"
as
Mary
call
herself
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
not
her
plainness
that
attract
them
(
and
let
all
plain
young
lady
be
warn
against
the
dangerous
encouragement
give
them
by
Society
to
confide
in
their
want
of
beauty
)
.
<EOS>
a
human
being
in
this
aged
nation
of
our
be
a
very
wonderful
whole
,
the
slow
creation
of
long
interchanging
influence
:
and
charm
be
a
result
of
two
such
whole

the

I

Fred

the

it
may
be
the
making
of
him

up

do
you
think

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
there
be
hardly
anything
honest
that
his

would
object
to
more

Mrs.

,
decidedly
.

"

care
I
about

Caleb

with
a
sturdiness

apt

have
an
opinion

"
the

be
of

must
get
his

He
have

enough

quickness
enough

he
like

it

my
belief

business
well

would
he

His

still

it

here
be

the

leave
it

Caleb

always

It
be
one
of

in

he
catch

whenever

he

it
may
end
by
let
us
into
the
secret
of
usurpation
and
other
scandal
gossip
about
long
empire
ago
:
 
this
world
be
apparently
a
huge
whispering
-
gallery
.
<EOS>
such
condition
be
often
minutely
represent
in
our
petty
lifetime
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
stone
which
have
be
kick
by
generation
of
clown
may
come
by
curious
little
link
of
effect
under
the
eye
of
a
scholar
,
through
whose
labor
it
may
at
last
fix
the
date
of
invasion
and
unlock
religion
,
so
a
bit
of
ink
and
paper
which
have
long
be
an
innocent
wrapping
or
stop
-
gap
may
at
last
be
lay
open
under
the
one
pair
of
eye
<EOS>
which
have
knowledge
enough
to
turn
it
into
the
opening
of
a
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
to
Uriel
watch
the
progress
of
planetary
history
from
the
sun
,
the
one
result
would
be
just
as
much
of
a
coincidence
as
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
have
make
this
rather
lofty
comparison
I
be
less
uneasy
in
call
attention
to
the
existence
of
low
people
by
whose
interference
,
however
little
we
may
like
it
,
the
course
of
the
world
be
very
much
determine
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
,
certainly
,
if
we
could
help
to
reduce
their
number
,
and
something
may
perhaps
be
do
by
not
lightly
give
occasion
to
their
existence
.
 
<EOS>
socially
speak
,
Joshua
Rigg
would
have
be
generally
pronounce
a
superfluity
.
 
<EOS>
but
those
who
like
Peter
Featherstone
never
have
a
copy
of
themselves
demand
,
be
the
very
last
to
wait
for
such
a
request
either
in
prose
or
verse
.
 
<EOS>
the
copy
in
this
case
bear
more
of
outside
resemblance
to
the
mother
,
in
whose
sex
frog
-
feature
,
accompany
with
fresh
-
colored
cheek
and
a
well
-
round
figure
,
be
compatible
with
much
charm
for
a
certain
order
of
admirer
.
<EOS>
the
result
be
sometimes
a
frog
-
face
male
,
desirable
,
surely
,
to
no
order
of
intelligent
being
.
 
<EOS>
especially
when
he
be
suddenly
bring
into
evidence
to
frustrate
other
people
's
expectation
 
the
very
low
aspect
in
which
a
social
superfluity
can
present
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
's
low
characteristic
be
all
of
the
sober
,
water
-
drinking
kind
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
early
to
the
late
hour
of
the
day
he
be
always
as
sleek
,
neat
,
and
cool
as
the
frog
he
resemble
,
and
old
Peter
have
secretly
chuckle
over
an
offshoot
almost
more
calculate
,
and
far
more
imperturbable
,
than
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
add
that
his
finger
-
nail
be
scrupulously
attend
to
,
and
that
he
mean
to
marry
a
well
-
educate
young
lady
(
as
yet
unspecified
)
whose
person
be
good
,
and
whose
connection
,
in
a
solid
middle
-
class
way
,
be
undeniable
.
 
<EOS>
thus
his
nail
and
modesty
be
comparable
to
those
of
most
gentleman
;
though
his
ambition
have
be
educate
only
by
the
opportunity
of
a
clerk
and
accountant
in
the
small
commercial
house
of
a
seaport
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
the
rural
Featherstones
very
simple
absurd
people
,
and
they
in
their
turn
regard
his
"
bring
up
"
in
a
seaport
town
as
an
exaggeration
of
the
monstrosity
that
their
brother
Peter
,
and
still
more
Peter
's
property
,
should
have
have
such
belonging
.
  
<EOS>
the
garden
and
gravel
approach
,
as
see
from
the
two
window
of
the
wainscote
parlor
at
Stone
Court
,
be
never
in
well
trim
than
now
,
when
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
stand
,
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
look
out
on
these
ground
as
their
master
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
doubtful
whether
he
look
out
for
the
sake
of
contemplation
or
of
turn
his
back
to
a
person
who
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
his
leg
considerably
apart
and
his
hand
in
his
trouser
-
pocket
:
a
person
in
all
respect
a
contrast
to
the
sleek
and
cool
Rigg
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
obviously
on
the
way
towards
sixty
,
very
florid
and
hairy
,
with
much
gray
in
his
bushy
whisker
and
thick
curly
hair
,
a
stoutish
body
which
show
to
disadvantage
the
somewhat
worn
joining
of
his
clothe
,
and
the
air
of
a
swaggerer
,
who
would
aim
at
be
noticeable
even
at
a
show
of
firework
,
regard
his
own
remark
on
any
other
person
's
performance
as
likely
to
be
more
interesting
than
the
performance
itself
.
  
<EOS>
His
name
be
John
Raffles
,
and
he
sometimes
write
jocosely
W.A.G.
after
his
signature
,
observe
when
he
do
so
,
that
he
be
once
teach
by
Leonard
Lamb
of
Finsbury
who
write
B.A.
after
his
name

and
that
he
,
Raffles
,
originate
the
witticism
of
call
that
celebrate
principal
Ba

Lamb

<EOS>
such
be
the
appearance
and
mental
flavor
of
Mr.
Raffles
,
both
of
which
seem
to
have
a
stale
odor
of
traveller

room
in
the
commercial
hotel
of
that
period

just
listen
to

the

you

anything

the

I
shall

the

I

do
you

your

me

My

she

no

<EOS>
as
Rigg
pronounce
the

he
turn
round
and
look
at

his
prominent
frozen

<EOS>
the
contrast
be
as
striking
as
it
could
have
be
eighteen
year
before
,
when
Rigg
be
a
most
unengaging
kickable
boy

Raffles
be
the
rather
thick

set
Adonis
of
bar

but
the
advantage
now
be
on
the

auditor
of
this

may
probably
have
expect
that
Raffles
would
retire
with
the
air

not

<EOS>
He

out

subside

<EOS>
He
jerk
forward
<EOS>
the
flask
and
Rigg
go
to
a
fine
old
oaken
bureau
with
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
but
Raffles
have
remind
himself
by
his
movement
with
the
flask
that
it
have
become
dangerously
loose
from
its
leather
covering
,
and
catch
sight
of
a
fold
paper
which
have
fall
within
the
fender
,
he
take
it
up

shove
it
under
the
leather
so
as
to
make
the
glass
firm

<EOS>
by
that

Rigg
come
forward
with
a
brandy

bottle
,
fill
the
flask
,
and
hand
Raffles
a
sovereign
,
neither
look

<EOS>
after
lock
up
the
bureau
again
,
he
walk
to
the
window
and
gaze
out
as
impassibly
as
he
have
do
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
,
while
Raffles
take
a
small
allowance
from
the
flask
,
screw
it
up
,
and
deposit
it
in
his
side

pocket
,
with
provoking
slowness

a
grimace
at

"
Farewell

Raffles

Rigg
see

leave

enter

<EOS>

gray

have
turn
to
a

freshen
the

to
do
a
bit
of
country
journey
on

,
look
as
incongruous
amid
this
moist
rural
quiet
and
industry
as
if
he
have
be

escape
from

there

none
to
show
dislike

except
the
little
water

rustle
away
at

be
fortunate
enough

Mr.

on
most

keep
up
the
sense
of
have
be
educate
at
an
academy

and
be
able

if

indeed

there
be
not

he
do
not

position
to
ridicule

torment

confident
of

thus
give

He
play
this
part
now
with
as
much
spirit

if
his
journey
have
be
entirely
successful

resort
at
frequent
interval

his

the
paper
with

he
have
wedge

Nicholas

SHAKESPEARE
:
Henry
VIII
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
professional
call
make
by
Lydgate
soon
after
his
return
from
his
wedding
-
journey
be
to
Lowick
Manor
,
in
consequence
of
a
letter
which
have
request
him
to
fix
a
time
for
his
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
have
never
put
any
question
concern
the
nature
of
his
illness
to
Lydgate
,
nor
have
he
even
to
Dorothea
betray
any
anxiety
as
to
how
far
it
may
be
likely
to
cut
short
his
labor
or
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
point
,
as
on
all
other
,
he
shrink
from
pity
;
and
if
the
suspicion
of
be
pity
for
anything
in
his
lot
surmise
or
know
in
spite
of
himself
be
embitter
,
the
idea
of
call
forth
a
show
of
compassion
by
frankly
admit
an
alarm
or
a
sorrow
be
necessarily
intolerable
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
every
proud
mind
know
something
of
this
experience
,
and
perhaps
it
be
only
to
be
overcome
by
a
sense
of
fellowship
deep
enough
to
make
all
effort
at
isolation
seem
mean
and
petty
instead
of
exalt
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Casaubon
be
now
brood
over
something
through
which
the
question
of
his
health
and
life
haunt
his
silence
with
a
more
harass
importunity
even
than
through
the
autumnal
unripeness
of
his
authorship
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
this
last
may
be
call
his
central
ambition
;
but
there
be
some
kind
of
authorship
in
which
by
far
the
large
result
be
the
uneasy
susceptibility
accumulate
in
the
consciousness
of
the
author
 
<EOS>
one
know
of
the
river
by
a
few
streak
amid
a
long
-
gather
deposit
of
uncomfortable
mud
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
with
Mr.
Casaubon
's
hard
intellectual
labor
.
 
<EOS>
Their
most
characteristic
result
be
not
the
"
key
to
all
Mythologies
,
"
but
a
morbid
consciousness
that
other
do
not
give
him
the
place
which
he
have
not
demonstrably
merit
 
a
perpetual
suspicious
conjecture
that
the
view
entertain
of
him
be
not
to
his
advantage
 
a
melancholy
absence
of
passion
in
his
effort
at
achievement
,
and
a
passionate
resistance
to
the
confession
that
he
have
achieve
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
thus
his
intellectual
ambition
which
seem
to
other
to
have
absorb
and
dry
him
,
be
really
no
security
against
wound
,
least
of
all
against
those
which
come
from
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
begin
now
to
frame
possibility
for
the
future
which
be
somehow
more
embitter
to
him
than
anything
his
mind
have
dwell
on
before
.
  
<EOS>
against
certain
fact
he
be
helpless
:
against
Will
Ladislaw
's
existence
,
his
defiant
stay
in
the
neighborhood
of
Lowick
,
and
his
flippant
state
of
mind
with
regard
to
the
possessor
of
authentic
,
well
-
stamp
erudition
:
against
Dorothea
's
nature
,
always
take
on
some
new
shape
of
ardent
activity
,
and
even
in
submission
and
silence
cover
fervid
reason
which
it
be
an
irritation
to
think
of
:
against
certain
notion
and
liking
which
have
take
possession
of
her
mind
in
relation
to
subject
that
he
could
not
possibly
discuss
with
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
deny
that
Dorothea
be
as
virtuous
and
lovely
a
young
lady
as
he
could
have
obtain
for
a
wife
;
but
a
young
lady
turn
out
to
be
something
more
troublesome
than
he
have
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
She
nurse
him
<EOS>
,
she
read
to
him
,
she
anticipate
his
want
,
and
be
solicitous
about
his
feeling
;
but
there
have
enter
into
the
husband
's
mind
the
certainty
that
she
judge
him
,
and
that
her
wifely
devotedness
be
like
<EOS>
a
penitential
expiation
of
unbelieve
thought
 
be
accompany
with
a
power
of
comparison
by
which
himself
and
his
doing
be
see
too
luminously
as
a
part
of
thing
in
general
.
 
<EOS>
His
discontent
pass
vapor
-
like
through
all
her
gentle
loving
manifestation
,
and
cling
to
that
inappreciative
world
which
she
have
only
bring
nearer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
!
 
<EOS>
this
suffering
be
the
hard
to
bear
because
it
seem
like
a
betrayal
:
<EOS>
the
young
creature
who
have
worship
him
with
perfect
trust
have
quickly
turn
into
the
critical
wife
;
and
early
instance
of
criticism
and
resentment
have
make
an
impression
which
no
tenderness
and
submission
afterwards
could
remove
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
suspicious
interpretation
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
silence
now
be
a
suppress
rebellion
;
a
remark
from
her
which
he
have
not
in
any
way
anticipate
be
an
assertion
of
conscious
superiority
;
her
gentle
answer
have
an
irritate
cautiousness
in
them
;
and
when
she
acquiesce
it
be
a
self
-
approve
effort
of
forbearance
.
 
<EOS>
the
tenacity
with
which
he
strove
to
hide
this
inward
drama
make
it
the
more
vivid
for
him
;
as
we
hear
with
the
more
keenness
what
we
wish
other
not
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
wonder
at
this
result
of
misery
in
Mr.
Casaubon
,
I
think
it
quite
ordinary
.
 
<EOS>
Will
not
a
tiny
speck
very
close
to
our
vision
blot
out
the
glory
of
the
world
,
and
leave
only
a
margin
by
which
we
see
the
blot
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
speck
<EOS>
so
troublesome
as
self
.
 
<EOS>
and
who
,
if
Mr.
Casaubon
have
choose
to
expound
his
discontent
 
his
suspicion
that
he
be
not
any
longer
adore
without
criticism
 
could
have
deny
that
they
be
found
on
good
reason
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
there
be
a
strong
reason
to
be
add
,
which
he
have
not
himself
take
explicitly
into
account
 
namely
,
that
he
be
not
unmixedly
adorable
.
 
<EOS>
He
suspect
this
,
however
,
as
he
suspect
other
thing
,
without
confess
it
,
and
like
the
rest
of
us
,
feel
how
soothing
it
would
have
be
to
have
a
companion
who
would
never
find
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
this
sore
susceptibility
in
relation
to
Dorothea
be
thoroughly
prepare
before
Will
Ladislaw
have
return
to
Lowick
,
and
what
have
occur
since
then
have
bring
Mr.
Casaubon
's
power
of
suspicious
construction
into
exasperate
activity
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
the
fact
which
he
know
,
he
add
imaginary
fact
both
present
and
future
which
become
more
real
to
him
than
those
because
they
call
up
a
strong
dislike
,
a
more
predominate
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
suspicion
and
jealousy
of
Will
Ladislaw
's
intention
,
suspicion
and
jealousy
of
Dorothea
's
impression
,
be
constantly
at
their
weaving
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
quite
unjust
to
him
to
suppose
that
he
could
have
enter
into
any
coarse
misinterpretation
of
Dorothea
:
his
own
habit
of
mind
and
conduct
,
quite
as
much
as
the
open
elevation
of
her
nature
,
save
him
from
any
such
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
what
he
be
jealous
of
be
her
opinion
,
the
sway
that
may
be
give
to
her
ardent
mind
in
its
judgment
,
and
the
future
possibility
to
which
these
may
lead
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Will
,
though
until
his
last
defiant
letter
he
have
nothing
definite
which
he
would
choose
formally
to
allege
against
him
,
he
feel
himself
warrant
in
believe
that
he
be
capable
of
any
design
which
could
fascinate
a
rebellious
temper
and
an
undisciplined
impulsiveness
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
sure
that
Dorothea
be
the
cause
of
Will
's
return
from
Rome
,
and
his
determination
to
settle
in
the
neighborhood
;
and
he
be
penetrate
enough
to
imagine
that
Dorothea
have
innocently
encourage
this
course
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
clear
as
possible
that
she
be
ready
to
be
attach
to
Will
and
to
be
pliant
to
his
suggestion
:
they
have
never
have
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
without
her
bring
away
from
it
some
new
troublesome
impression
,
and
the
last
interview
that
Mr.
Casaubon
be
aware
of
(
Dorothea
,
on
return
from
Freshitt
Hall
,
have
for
the
first
time
be
silent
about
have
see
Will
)
<EOS>
have
lead
to
a
scene
which
rouse
an
angrier
feeling
against
them
both
than
he
have
ever
know
before
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
outpouring
of
her
notion
about
money
,
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
have
do
nothing
but
bring
a
mixture
of
more
odious
forebode
into
her
husband
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
shock
lately
give
to
his
health
always
sadly
present
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
much
revive
;
he
have
recover
all
his
usual
power
of
work
:
the
illness
may
have
be
mere
fatigue
,
and
there
may
still
be
twenty
year
of
achievement
before
him
,
which
would
justify
the
thirty
year
of
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
that
prospect
be
make
the
sweeter
by
a
flavor
of
vengeance
against
the
hasty
sneer
of
Carp
&
Company
;
for
even
when
Mr.
Casaubon
be
carry
his
taper
among
the
tomb
of
the
past
,
those
modern
figure
come
athwart
the
dim
light
,
and
interrupt
his
diligent
exploration
.
 
<EOS>
to
convince
Carp
of
his
mistake
,
so
that
he
would
have
to
eat
his
own
word
with
a
good
deal
of
indigestion
,
would
be
an
agreeable
accident
of
triumphant
authorship
,
which
the
prospect
of
live
to
future
age
on
earth
and
to
all
eternity
in
heaven
could
not
exclude
from
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
since
,
thus
,
the
prevision
of
his
own
unending
bliss
could
not
nullify
the
bitter
savor
of
irritated
jealousy
and
vindictiveness
,
it
be
the
less
surprising
that
the
probability
of
a
transient
earthly
bliss
for
other
person
,
when
he
himself
should
have
enter
into
glory
,
have
not
a
potently
sweetening
effect
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
truth
should
be
that
some
undermine
disease
be
at
work
within
him
,
there
may
be
large
opportunity
for
some
people
to
be
the
happy
when
he
be
go
;
and
if
one
of
those
people
should
be
Will
Ladislaw
,
Mr.
Casaubon
object
so
strongly
that
it
seem
as
if
the
annoyance
would
make
part
of
his
disembodied
existence
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
bare
and
therefore
a
very
incomplete
way
of
put
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
human
soul
move
in
many
channel
,
and
Mr.
Casaubon
,
we
know
,
have
a
sense
of
rectitude
and
an
honorable
pride
in
satisfy
the
requirement
of
honor
,
which
compel
him
to
find
other
reason
for
his
conduct
than
those
of
jealousy
and
vindictiveness
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Casaubon
put
the
case
be
this
:
 
"
in
marry
Dorothea
Brooke
I
have
to
care
for
her
well
-
being
in
case
of
my
death
.
 
<EOS>
but
well
-
being
be
not
to
be
secure
by
ample
,
independent
possession
of
property
;
on
the
contrary
,
occasion
may
arise
in
which
such
possession
may
expose
her
to
the
more
danger
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
ready
prey
to
any
man
who
know
how
to
play
adroitly
either
on
her
affectionate
ardor
or
her
quixotic
enthusiasm
;
and
a
man
stand
by
with
that
very
intention
in
his
mind
 
a
man
with
no
other
principle
than
transient
caprice
,
and
who
have
a
personal
animosity
towards
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
it
 
an
animosity
which
be
feed
by
the
consciousness
of
his
ingratitude
,
and
which
he
have
constantly
vent
in
ridicule
of
which
I
be
as
well
assure
as
if
I
have
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
I
live
I
shall
not
be
without
uneasiness
as
to
what
he
may
attempt
through
indirect
influence
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
have
gain
Dorothea
's
ear
:
he
have
fascinate
her
attention
;
he
have
evidently
try
to
impress
her
mind
with
the
notion
that
he
have
claim
beyond
anything
I
have
do
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
die
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
wait
here
on
the
watch
for
that
 
<EOS>
he
will
persuade
her
to
marry
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
calamity
for
her
and
success
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
would
not
think
it
calamity
<EOS>
:
he
would
make
her
believe
anything
;
she
have
a
tendency
to
immoderate
attachment
which
she
inwardly
reproach
me
for
not
respond
to
,
and
already
her
mind
be
occupy
with
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
an
easy
conquest
and
of
enter
into
my
nest
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
will
hinder
!
<EOS>
such
a
marriage
would
be
fatal
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
ever
persist
in
anything
except
from
contradiction
?
 
<EOS>
in
knowledge
he
have
always
try
to
be
showy
at
small
cost
.
 
<EOS>
in
religion
he
could
be
,
as
long
as
it
suit
him
,
the
facile
echo
of
Dorothea
's
vagary
.
 
<EOS>
when
be
sciolism
ever
dissociate
from
laxity
?
 
<EOS>
I
utterly
distrust
his
moral
,
and
it
be
my
duty
to
hinder
to
the
utmost
the
fulfilment
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
arrangement
make
by
Mr.
Casaubon
on
his
marriage
leave
strong
measure
open
to
him
,
but
in
ruminate
on
them
his
mind
inevitably
dwelt
so
much
on
the
probability
of
his
own
life
that
the
longing
to
get
the
near
possible
calculation
have
at
last
overcome
his
proud
reticence
,
and
have
determine
him
to
ask
Lydgate
's
opinion
as
to
the
nature
of
his
illness
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
mention
to
Dorothea
that
Lydgate
be
come
by
appointment
at
half
-
past
three
,
and
in
answer
to
her
anxious
question
,
whether
he
have
feel
ill
,
reply
,
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
merely
wish
to
have
his
opinion
concern
some
habitual
symptom
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
see
him
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
give
order
that
he
may
be
send
to
me
in
the
Yew
-
tree
Walk
,
where
I
shall
be
take
my
usual
exercise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Lydgate
enter
the
Yew
-
tree
Walk
he
see
Mr.
Casaubon
slowly
recede
with
his
hand
behind
him
accord
to
his
habit
,
and
his
head
bend
forward
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
afternoon
;
the
leave
from
the
lofty
lime
be
fall
silently
across
the
sombre
evergreen
,
while
the
light
and
shadow
sleep
side
by
side
:
there
be
no
sound
<EOS>
but
the
cawing
of
the
rook
,
which
to
the
accustomed
ear
be
a
lullaby
,
or
that
last
solemn
lullaby
,
a
dirge
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
conscious
of
an
energetic
frame
in
its
prime
,
feel
some
compassion
when
the
figure
which
he
be
likely
soon
to
overtake
turn
round
,
and
in
advance
towards
him
show
more
markedly
than
ever
the
sign
of
premature
age
 
<EOS>
the
student
's
bent
shoulder
,
the
emaciate
limb
,
and
the
melancholy
line
of
the
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
,
"
he
think
,
"
some
man
with
his
year
be
like
lion
;
one
can
tell
nothing
of
their
age

that
they
be
full
grown

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lydgate

"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
his
invariably
polite
air
,
"
I
be
exceedingly
oblige
to
you
for
your
punctuality

<EOS>
We
will
,
if
you
please
,
carry
on
our
conversation
in
walk
to

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
wish
to
see
me
be
not
due
to
the
return
of
unpleasant
symptom

Lydgate
,
fill
up
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
immediately
 
no
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
account
for
that
wish
I
must
mention
 
what
it
be
otherwise
needless
to
refer
to
 
that
my
life
,
on
all
collateral
account
insignificant
,
derive
a
possible
importance
from
the
incompleteness
of
labor
which
have
extend
through
all
its
good
year
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
long
have
on
hand
a
work
which
I
would
fain
leave
behind
me
in
such
a
state
,
at
least
,
that
it
may
be
commit
to
the
press
by
 
other
.
 
<EOS>
be
I
assure
that
this
be
the
utmost
I
can
reasonably
expect
,
that
assurance
would
be
a
useful
circumscription
of
my
attempt
,
and
a
guide
in
both
the
positive
and
negative
determination
of
my
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mr.
Casaubon
pause
,
remove
one
hand
from
his
back
and
thrust
it
between
the
button
of
his
single
-
breast
coat
.
 
<EOS>
to
a
mind
largely
instruct
in
the
human
destiny
hardly
anything
could
be
more
interesting
than
the
inward
conflict
imply
in
his
formal
measured
address
,
deliver
with
the
usual
sing
-
song
and
motion
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
nay
,
be
there
many
situation
more
sublimely
tragic
than
the
struggle
of
the
soul
with
the
demand
to
renounce
a
work
which
have
be
all
the
significance
of
its
life
 
a
significance
which
be
to
vanish
as
the
water
which
come
and
go
where
no
man
have
need
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
to
strike
other
as
sublime
about
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
who
have
some
contempt
at
hand
for
futile
scholarship
,
feel
a
little
amusement
mingle
with
his
pity
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
at
present
too
ill
acquaint
with
disaster
to
enter
into
the
pathos
of
a
lot
where
everything
be
below
the
level
of
tragedy
except
the
passionate
egoism
of
the
sufferer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
refer
to
the
possible
hindrance
from
want
of
health
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
wish
to
help
forward
Mr.
Casaubon
's
purpose
,
which
seem
to
be
clog
by
some
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
imply
to
me
that
the
symptom
which
 
I
be
bind
to
testify
 
you
watch
with
scrupulous
care
,
be
those
of
a
fatal
disease
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
it
so
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
I
should
desire
to
know
the
truth
without
reservation
,
and
I
appeal
to
you
for
an
exact
statement
of
your
conclusion
:
I
request
it
as
a
friendly
service
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
can
tell
me
that
my
life
be
not
threaten
by
anything
else
than
ordinary
casualty
,
I
shall
rejoice
,
on
ground
which
I
have
already
indicate
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
knowledge
of
the
truth
be
even
more
important
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
can
no
longer
hesitate
as
to
my
course
,
"
say
Lydgate
;
"
but
the
first
thing
I
must
impress
on
you
be
that
my
conclusion
be
doubly
uncertain
 
uncertain
not
only
because
of
my
fallibility
,
but
because
disease
of
the
heart
be
eminently
difficult
to
find
prediction
on
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
one
can
hardly
increase
appreciably
the
tremendous
uncertainty
of
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
wince
perceptibly
,
but
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
you
be
suffer
from
what
be
call
fatty
degeneration
of
the
heart
,
a
disease
which
be
first
divine
and
explore
by
Laennec
,
the
man
who
give
us
the
stethoscope
,
not
so
very
many
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
deal
of
experience
 
a
more
lengthened
observation
 
be
want
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
after
what
you
have
say
,
it
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
death
from
this
disease
be
often
sudden
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
no
such
result
can
be
predict
.
 
<EOS>
Your
condition
may
be
consistent
with
a
tolerably
comfortable
life
for
another
fifteen
year
,
or
even
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
add
no
information
to
this
beyond
anatomical
or
medical
detail
,
which
would
leave
expectation
at
precisely
the
same
point
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
instinct
be
fine
enough
to
tell
him
that
plain
speech
,
quite
free
from
ostentatious
caution
,
<EOS>
would
be
feel
by
Mr.
Casaubon
as
a
tribute
of
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
Mr.
Lydgate

"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
<EOS>
"
one
thing
more
I
have
still
to
ask
:
do
you
communicate
what
you
have
now
tell
me
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
partly
 
I
mean
,
as
to
the
possible
issue

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
go
to
explain
why
he
have
tell
Dorothea
,
but
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
an
unmistakable
desire
to
end
the
conversation
,
wave
his
hand
slightly
,
and
say
again
,
"
I
thank
you
,
"
proceed
to
remark
on
the
rare
beauty
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
,
certain
that
his
patient
wish
to
be
alone
,
soon
leave
him
;
and
the
black
figure
with
hand
behind
and
head
bend
forward
continue
to
pace
the
walk
where
the
dark
yew
-
tree
give
him
a
mute
companionship
in
melancholy
,
and
the
little
shadow
of
bird
or
leaf
that
fleet
across
the
isle
of
sunlight
,
steal
along
in
silence
as
in
the
presence
of
a
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
man
who
now
for
the
first
time
find
himself
look
into
the
eye
of
death
 
who
be
pass
through
one
of
those
rare
moment
of
experience
when
we
feel
the
truth
of
a
commonplace
,
which
be
as
different
from
what
we
call
know
it
,
as
the
vision
of
water
upon
the
earth
be
different
from
the
delirious
vision
of
the
water
which
can
not
be
have
to
cool
the
burn
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
commonplace
"
We
must
all
die
"
transform
itself
suddenly
into
the
acute
consciousness
"
I
must
die
 
and
soon
,
"
then
death
grapple
us
,
and
his
finger
be
cruel
;
afterwards
,
he
may
come
to
fold
us
in
his
arm
as
our
mother
do
,
and
our
last
moment
of
dim
earthly
discerning
may
be
like
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
to
Mr.
Casaubon
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
as
if
he
suddenly
find
himself
on
the
dark
river
-
brink
and
hear
the
plash
of
the
oncoming
oar
,
not
discern
the
form
,
but
expect
the
summon
.
 
<EOS>
in
such
an
hour
the
mind
do
not
change
its
lifelong
bias
,
but
carry
it
onward
in
imagination
to
the
other
side
of
death
,
gaze
backward
 
perhaps
with
the
divine
calm
of
beneficence
,
perhaps
with
the
petty
anxiety
of
self
-
assertion
.
<EOS>
what
be
Mr.
Casaubon
's
bias
his
act
will
give
us
a
clew
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
himself
to
be
,
with
some
private
scholarly
reservation
,
a
believe
Christian
,
as
to
estimate
of
the
present
and
hope
of
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
we
strive
to
gratify
,
though
we
may
call
it
a
distant
hope
,
be
an
immediate
desire
:
the
future
estate
for
which
man
drudge
up
city
alley
exist
already
in
their
imagination
and
love
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Casaubon
's
immediate
desire
be
not
for
divine
communion
and
light
divest
of
earthly
condition
;
his
passionate
longing
,
poor
man
,
clung
low
and
mist
-
like
in
very
shady
place
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
be
aware
when
Lydgate
have
ride
away
,
and
she
have
step
into
the
garden
,
with
the
impulse
to
go
at
once
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
but
she
hesitate
,
fear
to
offend
him
by
obtrude
herself
;
for
her
ardor
,
continually
repulse
,
serve
,
with
her
intense
memory
,
to
heighten
her
dread
,
as
thwart
energy
subside
into
a
shudder
;
and
she
wander
slowly
round
the
near
clump
of
tree
until
she
see
him
advance
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
go
towards
him
,
and
may
have
represent
a
heaven
-
send
angel
come
with
a
promise
that
the
short
hour
remain
should
yet
be

with
that
faithful

which
cling
the
close
to
a
comprehend
grief
.
 
<EOS>
His
glance
in
reply
to
her
be
so
chill
that
she
feel
her
timidity
increase
;
yet
she
turn
and
pass
her
hand
through
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
keep
his
hand
behind
him
and
allow
her
pliant
arm
to
cling
with
difficulty
against
his
rigid
arm
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
horrible
to
Dorothea
in
the
sensation
which
this
unresponsive
hardness
inflict
on
her
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
strong
word
,
but
not
too
strong
:
it
be
in
these
act
call
triviality
that
the
seed
of
joy
be
forever
waste
,
until
man
and
woman
look
round
with
haggard
face
at
the
devastation
their
own
waste
have
make
,
and
say
,
the
earth
bear
no
harvest
of
sweetness
 
call
their
denial
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
ask
why
,
in
the
name
of
manliness
,
Mr.
Casaubon
should
have
behave
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
consider
that
his
be
a
mind
which
shrink
from
pity
:
have
you
ever
watch
in
such
a
mind
the
effect
of
a
suspicion
that
what
be
press
it
as
a
grief
may
be
really
a
source
of
contentment
,
either
actual
or
future
,
to
the
being
who
already
offend
by
pity
?
<EOS>
besides
,
he
know
little
of
Dorothea
's
sensation
,
and
have
not
reflect
that
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
they
be
comparable
in
strength
to
his
own
sensibility
about
Carp
's
criticism
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
do
not
withdraw
her
arm
,
but
she
could
not
venture
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
say
,
"
I
wish
to
be
alone
,
"
but
he
direct
his
step
in
silence
towards
the
house
,
and
as
they
enter
by
the
glass
door
on
this
eastern
side
,
Dorothea
withdraw
her
arm
and
linger
on
the
matting
,
that
she
may
leave
her
husband
quite
free
.
 
<EOS>
He
enter
the
library
and
shut
himself
in
,
alone
with
his
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
up
to
her
boudoir
.
 
<EOS>
the
open
bow
-
window
let
in
the
serene
glory
of
the
afternoon
lie
in
the
avenue
,
where
the
lime
-
tree
cast
long
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
know
nothing
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
She
throw
herself
on
a
chair
,
not
heed
that
she
be
in
the
dazzling
sun
-
ray
:
if
there
be
discomfort
in
that
,
how
could
she
tell
that
it
be
not
part
of
her
inward
misery
?
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
reaction
of
a
rebellious
anger
strong
than
any
she
have
feel
since
her
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
tear
there
come
word
:
    
"
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
 
<EOS>
what
be
I
 
that
he
should
treat
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
He
never
know
what
be
in
my
mind
 
he
never
care
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
anything
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
wish
he
have
never
marry
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
begin
to
hear
herself
,
and
be
check
into
stillness
.
 
<EOS>
like
one
who
have
lose
his
way
and
be
weary
,
she
sit
and
see
as
in
one
glance
all
the
path
of
her
young
hope
which
she
should
never
find
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
just
as
clearly
in
the
miserable
light
she
see
her
own
and
her
husband
's
solitude
 
<EOS>
how
they
walk
apart
so
that
she
be
oblige
to
survey
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
draw
her
towards
him
,
she
would
never
have
survey
him
 
never
have
say
,
"
be
he
worth
live
for
?
"
but
would
have
feel
him
simply
a
part
of
her
own
life
.
 
<EOS>
now
she
say
bitterly
,
"
It
be
his
fault
,
not
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
the
jar
of
her
whole
being
,
Pity
be
overthrow
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
her
fault
that
she
have
believe
in
him
 
have
believe
in
his
worthiness
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
,
exactly
,
be
he
?
   
<EOS>
She
be
able
enough
to
estimate
him
 
she
who
wait
on
his
glance
with
tremble
,
and
shut
her
good
soul
in
prison
,
pay
it
only
hidden
visit
,
that
she
may
be
petty
enough
to
please
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
such
a
crisis
as
this
,
some
woman
begin
to
hate
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
be
low
when
Dorothea
be
think
that
she
would
not
go
down
again
,
but
would
send
a
message
to
her
husband
say
that
she
be
not
well
and
prefer
remain
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
deliberately
allow
her
resentment
to
govern
her
in
this
way
before
,
but
she
believe
now
that
she
could
not
see
him
again
without
tell
him
the
truth
about
her
feeling
,
and
she
must
wait
till
she
could
do
it
without
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
wonder
and
be
hurt
at
her
message
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
good
that
he
should
wonder
and
be
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
Her
anger
say
,
as
anger
be
apt
to
say
,
that
God
be
with
her
 
that
all
heaven
,
though
it
be
crowd
with
spirit
watch
them
,
must
be
on
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
determine
to
ring
her
bell
,
when
there
come
a
rap
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
have
send
to
say
that
he
would
have
his
dinner
in
the
library
.
 
<EOS>
He
wish
to
be
quite
alone
this
evening
,
be
much
occupy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not

then

Tantripp

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

get
everything
ready
in
my
dressing

but
pray
do
not
disturb
me
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
sit
almost
motionless
in
her
meditative
struggle
,
while
the
evening
slowly
deepen
into
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
struggle
change
continually
,
as
that
of
a
man
who
begin
with
a
movement
towards
strike
and
end
with
conquer
his
desire
to
strike
.
 
<EOS>
the
energy
that
would
animate
a
crime
be
not
more
than
be
want
to
inspire
a
resolve
submission
,
when
the
noble
habit
of
the
soul
reassert
itself
.
<EOS>
that
think
with
which
Dorothea
have
go
out
to
meet
her
husband
 
<EOS>
her
conviction
that
he
have
be
ask
about
the
possible
arrest
of
all
his
work
,
and
that
the
answer
must
have
wring
his
heart
,
could
not
be
long
without
rise
beside
the
image
of
him
,
like
a
shadowy
monitor
look
at
her
anger
with
sad
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
her
a
litany
of
pictured
sorrow
and
of
silent
cry
that
she
may
be
the
mercy
for
those
sorrow
 
but
the
resolve
submission
do
come
;
and
when
the
house
be
still
,
and
she
know
that
it
be
near
the
time
when
Mr.
Casaubon
habitually
go
to
rest
,
she
open
her
door
gently
and
stand
outside
in
the
darkness
wait
for
his
come
up

stair
with
a
light
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
come
soon
she
think
that
she
would
go
down
and
even
risk
incur
another
pang
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
never
again
expect
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
do
hear
the
library
door
open
,
and
slowly
the
light
advance
up
the
staircase
without
noise
from
the
footstep
on
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
husband
stand
opposite
to
her
,
she
see
that
his
face
be
more
haggard
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
slightly
on
see
her
,
and
she
look
up
at
him
beseechingly
,
without
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dorothea

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
a
gentle
surprise
in
his
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

You

"
  
<EOS>
when
the
kind
quiet
melancholy
of
that
speech
fall
on
Dorothea

ear

she
feel
something
like
the
thankfulness
that
may

She

Dorothea
seldom
leave
home
without
her
husband
,
but
she
do
occasionally
drive
into
Middlemarch
alone
,
on
little
errand
of
shopping
or
charity
such
as
occur
to
every
lady
of
any
wealth
when
she
live
within
three
mile
of
a
town
.
 
<EOS>
two
day
after
that
scene
in
the
Yew
-
tree
Walk
,
she
determine
to
use
such
an
opportunity
in
order
if
possible
to
see
Lydgate
,
and
learn
from
him
whether
her
husband
have
really
feel
any
depressing
change
of
symptom
which
he
be
conceal
from
her
,
and
whether
he
have
insist
on
know
the
utmost
about
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
almost
guilty
in
ask
for
knowledge
about
him
from
another
,
but
the
dread
of
be
without
it
 
the
dread
of
that
ignorance
which
would
make
her
unjust
or
hard
 
overcome
every
scruple
.
 
<EOS>
that
there
have
be
some
crisis
in
her
husband
's
mind
<EOS>
she
be
certain
<EOS>
:
he
have
the
very
next
day
begin
a
new
method
of
arrange
his
note
,
and
have
associate
her
quite
newly
in
carry
out
his
plan
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothea
need
to
lay
up
store
of
patience
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
four
o'clock
when
she
drive
to
Lydgate
's
house
in
Lowick
Gate
,
wish
,
in
her
immediate
doubt
of
find
him
at
home
,
that
she
have
write
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
not
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mrs.
Lydgate
at
home
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
who
have
never
,
that
she
know
of
,
see
Rosamond
,
but
now
remember
the
fact
of
the
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
in
and
speak
to
her
,
if
she
will
allow
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
ask
her
if
she
can
see
me
 
see
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
for
a
few
minute
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
servant
have
go
to
deliver
that
message
,
Dorothea
could
hear
sound
of
music
through
an
open
window
 
a
few
note
from
a
man
's
voice
and
then
a
piano
burst
into
roulade
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
roulade
break
off
suddenly
,
and
then
the
servant
come
back
say
that
Mrs.
Lydgate
would
be
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
drawing
-
room
door
open
and
Dorothea
enter
,
there
be
a
sort
of
contrast
not
infrequent
in
country
life
when
the
habit
of
the
different
rank
be
less
blent
than
now
.
 
<EOS>
let
those
who
know
,
tell
us
exactly
what
stuff
<EOS>
it
be
that
Dorothea
wear
in
those
day
of
mild
autumn
 
<EOS>
that
thin
white
woollen
stuff
soft
to
the
touch
and
soft
to
the
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
seem
to
have
be
lately
wash
,
and
to
smell
of
the
sweet
hedge
 
be
always
in
the
shape
of
a
pelisse
with
sleeve
hang
all
out
of
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
yet
if
she
have
enter
before
a
still
audience
as
Imogene
or
Cato
's
daughter
,
the
dress
may
have
seem
right
enough
:
the
grace
and
dignity
be
in
her
limb
and
neck
;
and
about
her
simply
parted
hair
and
candid
eye
the
large
round
poke
which
be
then
in
the
fate
of
woman
,
seem
no
more
odd
as
a
head
-
dress
than
the
gold
trencher
we
call
a
halo
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
present
audience
of
two
person
,
no
dramatic
heroine
could
have
be
expect
with
more
interest
than
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
to
Rosamond
<EOS>
she
be
one
of
those
county
divinity
not
mix
with
Middlemarch
mortality
,
whose
slight
mark
of
manner
or
appearance
be
worthy
of
her
study
;
moreover
,
Rosamond
be
not
without
satisfaction
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
should
have
an
opportunity
of
study
_
<EOS>
her
_
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
be
exquisite
if
you
be
not
see
by
the
good
judge
?
<EOS>
and
since
Rosamond
have
receive
the
high
compliment
at
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
's
,
she
feel
quite
confident
of
the
impression
she
must
make
on
people
of
good
birth
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
put
out
her
hand
with
her
usual
simple
kindness
,
and
look
admiringly
at
Lydgate
's
lovely
bride
 
aware
that
there
be
a
gentleman
stand
at
a
distance
,
but
see
him
merely
as
a
coated
figure
at
a
wide
angle
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
too
much
occupy
with
the
presence
of
the
one
woman
to
reflect
on
the
contrast
between
the
two
 
<EOS>
a
contrast
that
would
certainly
have
be
strike
to
a
calm
observer
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
tall
,
and
their
eye
be
on
a
level
;
but
<EOS>
imagine
Rosamond
's
infantine
blondness
and
wondrous
crown
of
hair
-
plait
,
with
her
pale
-
blue
dress
of
a
fit
and
fashion
<EOS>
so
perfect
that
no
dressmaker
could
look
at
it
without
emotion
,
a
large
embroidered
collar
which
it
be
to
be
hope
all
beholder
would
know
the
price
of
,
her
small
hand
duly
set
off
with
ring
,
and
that
control
self
-
consciousness
of
manner
which
be
the
expensive
substitute
for
simplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
very
much
for
allow
me
to
interrupt
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
anxious
to
see
Mr.
Lydgate
,
if
possible
,
before
I
go
home
,
and
I
hope
that
you
may
possibly
tell
me
where
I
could
find
him
,
or
even
allow
me
to
wait
for
him
,
if
you
expect
him
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
at
the
New
Hospital
,
"
say
Rosamond
;
"
I
be
not
sure
how
soon
he
will
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
send
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
go
and
fetch
him
?
"
say
Will
Ladislaw
,
come
forward
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
take
up
his
hat
before
Dorothea
enter
.
 
<EOS>
She
color
with
surprise
,
but
put
out
her
hand
with
a
smile

if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
give
the
message

the
coachman

"
  
Will
be
move
to
the
door
when
Dorothea
,
whose
mind
have
flash
in
an
instant
over
many
connected
memory

turn
quickly
and

,

I
will

myself

thank
you

I
wish
to
lose
no

home
again

<EOS>
I
will
drive
to
the

and
see
Mr.
Lydgate
there

<EOS>
Pray
excuse
me
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
evidently
arrest
by
some
sudden
thought
,
and
she
leave
the
room
hardly
conscious
of
what
be
immediately
around
her
 
hardly
conscious
that
Will
open
the
door
for
her
and
offer
her
his
arm
to
lead
her
to
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
the
arm
but
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
feel
rather
vexed
and
miserable
,
and
find
nothing
to
say
on
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
hand
her
into
the
carriage
in
silence
,
they
say
good
-
by
,
and
Dorothea
drive
away
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
five
minute
'
drive
to
the
Hospital
she
have
time
for
some
reflection
that
be
quite
new
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
decision
to
go
,
and
her
preoccupation
in
leave
the
room
,
have
come
from
the
sudden
sense
that
there
would
be
a
sort
of
deception
in
her
voluntarily
allow
any
further
intercourse
between
herself
and
Will
which
she
be
unable
to
mention
to
her
husband
,
and
already
her
errand
in
seek
Lydgate
be
a
matter
of
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
that
have
be
explicitly
in
her
mind
;
but
she
have
be
urge
also
by
a
vague
discomfort
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
she
be
alone
in
her
drive
,
she
hear
the
note
of
the
man
's
voice
and
the
accompany
piano
,
which
she
have
not
note
much
at
the
time
,
return
on
her
inward
sense
;
and
she
find
herself
think
with
some
wonder
that
Will
Ladislaw
be
pass
his
time
with
Mrs.
Lydgate
in
her
husband
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
could
not
help
remember
that
he
have
pass
some
time
with
her
under
like
circumstance
,
so
why
should
there
be
any
unfitness
in
the
fact
?
 
<EOS>
but
Will
be
Mr.
Casaubon
's
relative
,
and
one
towards
whom
she
be
bind
to
show
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
still
there
have
be
sign
which
perhaps
she
ought
to
have
understand
as
imply
that
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
like
his
cousin
's
visit
during
his
own
absence
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
have
be
mistake
in
many
thing
,
"
say
poor
Dorothea
to
herself
,
while
the
tear
come
roll
and
she
have
to
dry
them
quickly
.
<EOS>
She
feel
confusedly
unhappy
,
and
the
image
of
Will
which
have
be
so
clear
to
her
before
be
mysteriously
spoil
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
carriage
stop
at
the
gate
of
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
soon
walk
round
the
grass
plot
with
Lydgate
,
and
her
feeling
recover
the
strong
bent
which
have
make
her
seek
for
this
interview
.
  
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
,
meanwhile
,
be
mortify
,
and
know
the
reason
of
it
clearly
enough
.
 
<EOS>
His
chance
of
meeting
Dorothea
be
rare
;
and
here
for
the
first
time
there
have
come
a
chance
which
have
set
him
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
,
as
it
have
be
hitherto
,
that
she
be
not
supremely
occupied
with
him
,
but
that
she
have
see
him
under
circumstance
in
which
he
may
appear
not
to
be
supremely
occupied
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
thrust
to
a
new
distance
from
her
,
amongst
the
circle
of
Middlemarchers
who
make
no
part
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
his
fault
:
of
course
,
since
he
have
take
his
lodging
in
the
town
,
he
have
be
make
as
many
acquaintance
as
he
could
,
his
position
require
that
he
should
know
everybody
and
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
really
better
worth
know
than
any
one
else
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
he
happen
to
have
a
wife
who
be
musical
and
altogether
worth
call
upon
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
whole
history
of
the
situation
in
which
Diana
have
descend
too
unexpectedly
on
her
worshipper
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
mortify
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
conscious
that
he
should
not
have
be
at
Middlemarch
but
for
Dorothea
;
and
yet
his
position
there
be
threaten
to
divide
him
from
her
with
those
barrier
of
habitual
sentiment
which
be
more
fatal
to
the
persistence
of
mutual
interest
than
all
the
distance
between
Rome
and
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
prejudice
about
rank
and
status
be
easy
enough
to
defy
in
the
form
of
a
tyrannical
letter
from
Mr.
Casaubon
;
but
prejudice
,
like
odorous
body
,
have
a
double
existence
both
solid
and
subtle
 
solid
as
the
pyramid
,
subtle
as
the
twentieth
echo
of
an
echo
,
or
as
the
memory
of
hyacinth
which
once
scent
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
and
Will
be
of
a
temperament
to
feel
keenly
the
presence
of
subtlety
<EOS>
:
a
man
of
clumsier
perception
would
not
have
feel
,
as
he
do
,
that
for
the
first
time
some
sense
of
unfitness
in
perfect
freedom
with
him
have
spring
up
in
Dorothea
's
mind
,
and
that
their
silence
,
as
he
conduct
her
to
the
carriage
,
have
have
a
chill
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
Casaubon
,
in
his
hatred
and
jealousy
,
have
be
insist
to
Dorothea
that
Will
have
slide
below
her
socially
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
Casaubon
!
  
<EOS>
Will
re
-
enter
the
drawing
-
room
,
take
up
his
hat
,
and
look
irritated
as
he
advance
towards
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
who
have
seat
herself
at
her
work
-
table
,
say
    
"
It
be
always
fatal
to
have
music
or
poetry
interrupt
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
come
another
day
and
just
finish
about
the
rendering
of

sulkily

just
the
answer

give
me

first
ask
him

not
indispose

provoke

charming

that
do

the
effect

Lydgate

unlike
other
woman

with

You
be

often

no

almost
pettishly

yes

Rosamond
feel
herself
begin
to
know
a
great
deal
of
the
world
,
especially
in
discover
what
when
she
be
in
her
unmarried
girlhood
have
be
inconceivable
to
her

as
a
dim
tragedy
in

that
woman
,
even
after

may
make
conquest

<EOS>
at
that

young
lady
in

even
when
educate
at
Mrs.
Lemon

,
read
little
french
literature
later
than
Racine

and
public
print
have
not
cast
their

magnificent
illumination
over

<EOS>
still
,
vanity
,
with
a

whole

can
construct
abundantly
on
slight
hint

especially
on
such
a
hint
as
the
possibility
of
indefinite
conquest

<EOS>
how
delightful
to
make
captive
from
the
throne
of
marriage
with
a
husband
as
crown
-
prince
by
your
side
 
himself
in
fact
a

look
up
forever
hopeless

lose
their
rest
probably

their

much

Rosamond

have
learn
from
him
that
there
be
no

change
in
Mr.

bodily
condition

the
mental
sign
of
anxiety
to
know
the
truth
about

she
be
silent
for
a

Lydgate

I

circumstance

make
it

that
be
not

it
be
because
there

.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
"
she
say
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
that
the
people
in
our
village
be
tolerably
comfortable
,
and
my
mind
have
be
too
much
take
up
for
me
to
inquire
further
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
 
in
such
a
place
as
Middlemarch
 
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
great
deal
to
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
everything
to
be
do
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
abrupt
energy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
this
hospital
be
a
capital
piece
of
work
,
due
entirely
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
exertion
,
and
in
a
great
degree
to
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
man
can
not
do
everything
in
a
scheme
of
this
sort
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
look
forward
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
there
be
a
mean
<EOS>
,
petty
feud
set
up
against
the
thing
in
the
town
,
by
certain
person
who
want
to
make
it
a
failure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
be
their
reason
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
naive
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chiefly
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
unpopularity
,
to
begin
with
.
 
<EOS>
half
the
town
would
almost
take
trouble
for
the
sake
of
thwart
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
stupid
world
most
people
never
consider
that
a
thing
be
good
to
be
do
unless
it
be
do
by
their
own
set
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
connection
with
Bulstrode
before
I
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
quite
impartially
,
and
I
see
that
he
have
some
notion
 
that
he
have
set
thing
on
foot
 
which
I
can
turn
to
good
public
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
fair
number
of
the
better
educate
man
go
to
work
with
the
belief
that
their
observation
may
contribute
to
the
reform
of
medical
doctrine
and
practice
,
we
should
soon
see
a
change
for
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
that
by
refuse
to
work
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
I
should
be
turn
my
back
on
an
opportunity
of
make
my
profession
more
generally
serviceable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
at
once
fascinate
by
the
situation
sketch
in
Lydgate
's
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
there
against
Mr.
Bulstrode
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
my
uncle
be
friendly
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
People
do
not
like
his
religious
tone
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
break
off
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
the
strong
reason
for
despise
such
an
opposition
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
look
at
the
affair
of
Middlemarch
by
the
light
of
the
great
persecution
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
put
the
matter
quite
fairly
,
they
have
other
objection
to
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
masterful
and
rather
unsociable
,
and
he
be
concerned
with
trade
,
which
have
complaint
of
its
own
that
I
know
nothing
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
have
that
to
do
with
the
question
whether
it
would
not
be
a
fine
thing
to
establish
here
a
more
valuable
hospital
than
any
they
have
in
the
county
?
 
<EOS>
the
immediate
motive
to
the
opposition
,
however
,
be
the
fact
that
Bulstrode
have
put
the
medical
direction
into
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
glad
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
me
an
opportunity
of
do
some
good
work
,
 
and
I
be
aware
that
I
have
to
justify
his
choice
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
consequence
be
,
that
the
whole
profession
in
Middlemarch
have
set
themselves
tooth
and
nail
against
the
Hospital
,
and
not
only
refuse
to
cooperate
themselves
,
but
try
to
blacken
the
whole
affair
and
hinder
subscription
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
petty
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Dorothea
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
one
must
expect
to
fight
one
's
way
:
there
be
hardly
anything
to
be
do
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
ignorance
of
people
about
here
be
stupendous
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
lay
claim
to
anything
else
than
have
use
some
opportunity
which
have
not
come
within
everybody
's
reach
;
but
there
be
no
stifle
the
offence
of
be
young
,
and
a
new
-
comer
,
and
happen
to
know
something
more
than
the
old
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
if
I
believe
that
I
can
set
go
a
well
method
of
treatment
 
if
I
believe
that
I
can
pursue
certain
observation
and
inquiry
which
may
be
a
lasting
benefit
to
medical
practice
,
I
should
be
a
base
truckler
if
I
allow
any
consideration
of
personal
comfort
to
hinder
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
course
be
all
the
clear
from
there
be
no
salary
in
question
to
put
my
persistence
in
an
equivocal
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
have
tell
me
this
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
I
can
help
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
money
,
and
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
 
that
be
often
an
uncomfortable
thought
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
can
spare
two
hundred
a

year
for
a
grand
purpose
like
this

<EOS>
how
happy
you
must
be
,
to
know
thing
that
you
feel
sure
will
do
great
good
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
awake
with
that
knowledge
every
morning
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
so
much
trouble
take
that
one
can
hardly
see
the
good
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
melancholy
cadence
in
Dorothea
's
voice
as
she
speak
these
last
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
presently
add
,
more
cheerfully
,
"
pray
come
to
Lowick
and
tell
us
more
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
mention
the
subject
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
hasten
home
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
mention
it
that
evening
,
and
say
that
she
should
like
to
subscribe
two
hundred
a
-
year
 
<EOS>
she
have
seven
hundred
a
-
year
as
the
equivalent
of
her
own
fortune
,
settle
on
her
at
her
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
make
no
objection
beyond
a
pass
remark
that
the
sum
may
be
disproportionate
in
relation
to
other
good
object
,
but
when
Dorothea
in
her
ignorance
resist
that
suggestion
,
he
acquiesce
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
himself
about
spend
money
,
and
be
not
reluctant
to
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
ever
feel
keenly
any
question
of
money
it
be
through
the
medium
of
another
passion
than
the
love
of
material
property
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
tell
him
that
she
have
see
Lydgate
,
and
recite
the
gist
of
her
conversation
with
him
about
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
question
her
further
,
but
he
feel
sure
that
she
have
wish
to
know
what
have
pass
between
Lydgate
and
himself
.
"
<EOS>
She
know
that
I
know
,
"
say
the
ever
-
restless
voice
within
;
but
that
increase
of
tacit
knowledge
only
thrust
further
off
any
confidence
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
distrust
her
affection
;
and
what
loneliness
be
more
lonely
than
distrust
?
        
<EOS>
It
be
the
humor
of
many
head
to
extol
the
day
of
their
    
forefather
,
and
declaim
against
the
wickedness
of
time
    
present
.
<EOS>
which
notwithstanding
they
can
not
handsomely
do
,
    
without
the
borrow
help
and
satire
of
time
past
;
    
condemn
the
vice
of
their
own
time
,
by
the
expression
    
of
vice
in
time
which
they
commend
,
which
can
not
but
argue
    
the
community
of
vice
in
both

horace
,
therefore
,
Juvenal
,
    
and
Persius

be
no
prophet

<EOS>
SIR
THOMAS
BROWNE
:
    
Pseudodoxia
Epidemica
.
  
<EOS>
that
opposition
to
the
New
Fever
Hospital
which
Lydgate
have
sketch
to
Dorothea
be
,
like
other
opposition
,
to
be
view
in
many
different
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
regard
it
as
a
mixture
of
jealousy
and
dunderheade
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
see
in
it
not
only
medical
jealousy
but
a
determination
to
thwart
himself
,
prompt
mainly
by
a
hatred
of
that
vital
religion
of
which
he
have
strive
to
be
an
effectual
lay
representative
 
<EOS>
a
hatred
which
certainly
find
pretext
apart
from
religion
such
as
be
only
too
easy
to
find
in
the
entanglement
of
human
action
.
 
<EOS>
these
may
be
call
the
ministerial
view
.
 
<EOS>
but
opposition
have
the
illimitable
range
of
objection
at
command
,
which
need
never
stop
short
at
the
boundary
of
knowledge
,
but
can
draw
forever
on
the
vast
of
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
opposition
in
Middlemarch
say
about
the
New
Hospital
and
its
administration
have
certainly
a
great
deal
of
echo
in
it
,
for
heaven
have
take
care
that
everybody
shall
not
be
an
originator
;
but
there
be
difference
which
represent
every
social
shade
between
the
polished
moderation
of
Dr.
Minchin
and
the
trenchant
assertion
of
Mrs.
Dollop
,
the
landlady
of
the
Tankard
in
Slaughter
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dollop
become
more
and
more
convinced
by
her
own
asseveration
,
that
Dr.
Lydgate
mean
to
let
the
people
die
in
the
Hospital
,
if
not
to
poison
them
,
for
the
sake
of
cut
them
up
without
say
by
your
leave
or
with
your
leave
;
for
it
be
a
know
"
fac
"
that
he
have
want
to
cut
up
Mrs.
Goby
,
as
respectable
a
woman
as
any
in
Parley
Street
,
who
have
money
in
trust
before
her
marriage
 
a
poor
tale
for
a
doctor
,
who
if
he
be
good
for
anything
should
know
what
be
the
matter
with
you
before
you
die
,
and
not
want
to
pry
into
your
inside
after
you
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
not
reason
,
Mrs.
Dollop
wish
to
know
what
be
;
but
there
be
a
prevalent
feeling
in
her
audience
that
her
opinion
be
a
bulwark
,
and
that
if
it
be
overthrow
there
would
be
no
limit
to
the
cutting
-
up
of
body
,
as
have
be
well
see
in
Burke
and
Hare
with
their
pitch
-
plaister
 
such
a
hang
business
as
that
be
not
want
in
Middlemarch
!
  
<EOS>
and
let
it
not
be
suppose
that
opinion
at
the
Tankard
in
Slaughter
Lane
be
unimportant
to
the
medical
profession
:
<EOS>
that
old
authentic
public
-
house
 
<EOS>
the
original
Tankard
,
know
by
the
name
of
Dollop
's
 
be
the
resort
of
a
great
Benefit
Club
,
which
have
some
month
before
put
to
the
vote
whether
its
long
-
stand
medical
man
,
"
Doctor
Gambit
,
"
should
not
be
cashier
in
favor
of
"
this
Doctor
Lydgate
,
"
who
be
capable
of
perform
the
most
astonishing
cure
,
and
rescue
people
altogether
give
up
by
other
practitioner
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
balance
have
be
turn
against
Lydgate
by
two
member
,
who
for
some
private
reason
hold
that
this
power
of
resuscitating
person
as
good
as
dead
be
an
equivocal
recommendation
,
and
may
interfere
with
providential
favor
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
year
,
however
,
there
have
be
a
change
in
the
public
sentiment
,
of
which
the
unanimity
at
Dollop
's
be
an
index
.
  
<EOS>
a
good

more
than
a

before
anything

skill
,
the
judgment
on
it
have
naturally
be
divide

depend
on
a
sense
of
likelihood
,
situate
perhaps
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
or
in
the
pineal
gland
,
and
differ
in
its
verdict
,
but
not
the
less
valuable
as
a
guide
in
the
total
deficit
of
evidence
.
<EOS>
patient
who
have
chronic
disease
or
whose
life
have
long
be
wear
threadbare
,
like
old
Featherstone
's
,
have
be
at
once
incline
to
try
him
;
also
,
many
who
do
not
like
pay
their
doctor
's
bill
,
think
agreeably
of
open
an
account
with
a
new
doctor
and
send
for
him
without
stint
if
the
child
's
temper
want
a
dose
,
occasion
when
the
old
practitioner
be
often
crusty
;
and
all
person
thus
incline
to
employ
Lydgate
hold
it
likely
that
he
be
clever
.
 
<EOS>
some
consider
that
he
may
do
more
than
other
"
where
there
be
liver
;
"
 
at
least
there
would
be
no
harm
in
get
a
few
bottle
of
"
stuff
"
from
him
,
since
if
these
prove
useless
it
would
still
be
possible
to
return
to
the
Purifying
Pills
,
which
keep
you
alive
if
they
do
not
remove
the
yellowness
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
be
people
of
minor
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Good
Middlemarch
family
be
of
course
not
go
to
change
their
doctor
without
reason
show
;
and
everybody
who
have
employ
Mr.
Peacock
do
not
feel
obliged
to
accept
a
new
man
merely
in
the
character
of
his
successor
,
object
that
he
be
"
not
likely
to
be
equal
to
Peacock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Lydgate
have
not
be
long
in
the
town
before
there
be
particular
enough
report
of
him
to
breed
much
more
specific
expectation
and
to
intensify
difference
into
partisanship
;
some
of
the
particular
be
of
that
impressive
order
of
which
the
significance
be
entirely
hide
,
like
a
statistical
amount
without
a
standard
of
comparison
,
but
with
a
note
of
exclamation
at
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
the
cubic
foot
of
oxygen
yearly
swallow
by
a
full

grown
man
 
<EOS>
what
a
shudder
they
may
have
create
in

Middlemarch
circle

<EOS>
"
Oxygen

<EOS>
nobody

what
that

it
any

<EOS>
and
yet
there
be

"
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
fact
quickly
rumor
be
that
Lydgate
do
not
dispense
drug
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
offensive
both
to
the
physician
whose
exclusive
distinction
seem
infringe
on
,
and
to
the
surgeon
-
apothecary
with
whom
he
range
himself
;
and
only
a
little
while
before
,
they
may
have
count
on
have
the
law
on
their
side
against
a
man
who
without
call
himself
a
London
-
make
M.D.
dare
to
ask
for
pay
except
as
a
charge
on
drug
.
 
<EOS>
but
Lydgate
have
not
be
experience
enough
to
foresee
that
his
new
course
would
be
even
more
offensive
to
the
laity
;
and
to
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
an
important
grocer
in
the
Top
Market
,
who
,
though
not
one
of
his
patient
,
question
him
in
an
affable
manner
on
the
subject
,
he
be
injudicious
enough
to
give
a
hasty
popular
explanation
of
his
reason
,
point
out
to
Mr.
Mawmsey
that
it
must
lower
the
character
of
practitioner
,
and
be
a
constant
injury
to
the
public
,
if
their
only
mode
of
get
pay
for
their
work
be
by
their
make

long
bill

he

enjoy
the

so
as
to
give
an
intelligent

for

of
Mr.

a
practitioner
just
a
little
low
in

Wrench

especially
esteem
as
an

of

Mr.

,
Mr.

with

you
could
have
patience

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
"
no

no

I

hear

the

lift

(
He

how
will
he
cure

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
say
,
"
return
Mrs.

who
habitually
give
weight

<EOS>
"
do
_

suppose

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mawmsey
have
have
a
great
deal
of
sit
from
Mr.
Gambit
,
include
very
full
account
of
his
own
habit
of
body
and
other
affair
;
but
of
course
he
know
there
be
no
innuendo
in
her
remark
,
since
his
spare
time
and
personal
narrative
have
never

for

<EOS>
so
he
reply
,
humorously
    
"
well
,
Lydgate
be
a

you
know

"
  
<EOS>

not

<EOS>
"
_
Others
_
may

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
hence
Mr.
Gambit
could
go
away
from
the
chief
grocer
's
without
fear
of
rivalry
,
but
not
without
a
sense
that
Lydgate
be
one
of
those
hypocrite
who
try
to
discredit
other
by
advertise
their
own
honesty
,
and
that
it
may
be
worth
some
people
's
while
to
show
him
up
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gambit
,
however
,
have
a
satisfactory
practice
,
much
pervade
by
the
smell
of
retail
trading
which
suggest
the
reduction
of
cash
payment
to
a
balance
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
do
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
show
Lydgate
up
until
he
know
how
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
indeed
great
resource
of
education
,
and
have
have
to
work
his
own
way
against
a
good
deal
of
professional
contempt
;
but
he
make
none
the
bad
accoucheur
for
call
the
breathing
apparatus
"
long

"
  
<EOS>
other
medical
man
feel
themselves
more
capable
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Toller
share
the
high
practice
in
the
town
and
belong
to
an
old
Middlemarch
family
:
there
be
toller
in
the
law
and
everything
else
above
the
line
of
retail
trade
.
 
<EOS>
unlike
our
irascible
friend
Wrench
,
he
have
the
easy
way
in
the
world
of
take
thing
which
may
be
suppose
to
annoy
him
,
be
a
well
-
breed
,
quietly
facetious
man
,
who
keep
a
good
house
,
be
very
fond
of
a
little
sporting
when
he
could
get
it
,
very
friendly
with
Mr.
Hawley
,
and
hostile
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
odd
that
with
such
pleasant
habit
he
should
have
be
give
to
the
heroic
treatment
,
bleeding
and
blister
and
starve
his
patient
,
with
a
dispassionate
disregard
to
his
personal
example
;
but
the
incongruity
favor
the
opinion
of
his
ability
among
his
patient
,
who
commonly
observe
that
Mr.
Toller
have
lazy
manner
,
but
his
treatment
be
as
active
as
you
could
desire
:
no
man
,
say
they
,
carry
more
seriousness
into
his
profession
:
he
be
a
little
slow
in
come
,
but
when
he
come
,
he
_
do
_
something
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
favorite
in
his
own
circle
,
and
whatever
he
imply
to
any
one
's
disadvantage
tell
doubly
from
his
careless
ironical
tone
.
  
<EOS>
He
naturally
get
tired
of
smile
and
say
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
he
be
tell
that
Mr.
Peacock
's
successor
do
not
mean
to
dispense
medicine
;
and
Mr.
Hackbutt
one
day
mention
it
over
the
wine
at
a
dinner
-
party
,
Mr.
Toller
say
,
laughingly
,
"
Dibbitts
will
get
rid
of
his
stale
drug
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
fond
of
little
Dibbitts
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
he
be
in
luck

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
meaning

Toller
,
"
say
Mr.
Hackbutt
,
"
and
I
be
entirely
of
your
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
take
an
opportunity
of
express
myself
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
a
medical
man
should
be
responsible
for
the
quality
of
the
drug
consume
by
his
patient
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
rationale
of
the
system
of
charging
which
have
hitherto
obtain
;
and
nothing
be
more
offensive
than
this
ostentation
of
reform
,
where
there
be
no
real
amelioration
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ostentation
,
Hackbutt
?
"
say
Mr.
Toller
,
ironically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
very
well
be
ostentatious
of
what
nobody
believe
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
reform
in
the
matter
:
the
question
be
,
whether
the
profit
on
the
drug
be
pay
to
the
medical
man
by
the
druggist
or
by
the
patient
,
and
whether
there
shall
be
extra
pay
under
the
name
of
attendance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
to
be
sure
;
one
of
your
damned
new
version
of
old
humbug
,
"
say
Mr.
Hawley
,
pass
the
decanter
to
Mr.
Wrench
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrench
,
generally
abstemious
,
often
drink
wine
rather
freely
at
a
party
,
get
the
more
irritable
in
consequence

<EOS>
"
as
to
humbug
,
Hawley
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
be
a
word
easy

about

<EOS>
but
what
I
contend
against
be
the
way
medical

be
foul
their
own
nest
,
and
set
up
a
cry
about
the
country
as
if
a
general
practitioner

dispense
drug
could
not
be
a

<EOS>
I
throw
back
the
imputation
with
scorn

<EOS>
I
say
,
the
most
ungentlemanly
trick
a
man
can
be
guilty
of
be
to
come
among
the
member
of
his
profession
with
innovation
which
be
a
libel
on

honor
procedure

<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion

I
be
ready

maintain
it
against

Mr.

<EOS>
Mr.

verify

<EOS>
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Mawmsey
,
who
have
no
idea
of
employ
Lydgate
,
be
make
uneasy
by
his
suppose
declaration
against
drug
,
it
be
inevitable
that
those
who
call
him
in
should
watch
a
little
anxiously
to
see
whether
he
do
"
use
all
the
mean
he
may
use
"
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
even
good
Mr.
Powderell
,
who
in
his
constant
charity
of
interpretation
be
incline
to
esteem
Lydgate
the
more
for
what
seem
a
conscientious
pursuit
of
a
well
plan
,
have
his
mind
disturb
with
doubt
during
his
wife
's
attack
of
erysipelas
,
and
could
not
abstain
from
mention
to
Lydgate
that
Mr.
Peacock
on
a
similar
occasion
have
administer
a
series
of
bolus
which
be
not
otherwise
definable
than
by
their
remarkable
effect
in
bring
Mrs.
Powderell
round
before
Michaelmas
from
an
illness
which
have
begin
in
a
remarkably
hot
August
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
indeed
,
in
the
conflict
between
his
desire
not
to
hurt
Lydgate
and
his
anxiety
that
no
"
mean
"
should
be
lack
,
he
induce
his
wife
privately
to
take
Widgeon
's
Purifying
Pills
,
an
esteemed
Middlemarch
medicine
,
which
arrest
every
disease
at
the
fountain
by
set
to
work
at
once
upon
the
blood
.
 
<EOS>
this
co
-
operative
measure
be
not
to
be
mention
to
Lydgate
,
and
Mr.
Powderell
himself
have
no
certain
reliance
on
it
,
only
hope
that
it
may
be
attend
with
a
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
this
doubtful
stage
of
Lydgate
's
introduction
he
be
help
by
what
we
mortal
rashly
call
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
no
doctor
ever
come
newly
to
a
place
without
make
cure
that
surprise
somebody
 
<EOS>
cure
which
may
be
call
fortune
's
testimonial
,
and
deserve
as
much
credit
as
the
write
or
print
kind
.
 
<EOS>
various
patient
get
well
while
Lydgate
be
attend
them
,
some
even
of
dangerous
illness
;
and
it
be
remark
that
the
new
doctor
with
his
new
way
have
at
least
the
merit
of
bring
people
back
from
the
brink
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
trash
talk
on
such
occasion
<EOS>
be
the
more
vexatious
to
Lydgate
,
because
it
give
precisely
the
sort
of
prestige
which
an
incompetent
and
unscrupulous
man
would
desire
,
and
be
sure
to
be
impute
to
him
by
the
simmer
dislike
of
the
other
medical
man
as
an
encouragement
on
his
own
part
of
ignorant
puffing
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
his
proud
outspokenness
be
check

Mrs.

have
just
become
charitably
concerned
about
alarm
symptom
in
her
charwoman

when
Dr.
Minchin
call
,
ask
him
to
see
her
then
and
there
,
and
to
give
her
a
certificate
for
the
Infirmary
;
whereupon
after
examination
he
write
a
statement
of
the
case
as
one
of
tumor
,
and
recommend
the
bearer
Nancy
Nash
as
an
out

<EOS>
Nancy
,
call
at
home
on
her
way
to
the
Infirmary
,
allow
the
stay
maker
and
his
wife
,
in
whose
attic
she
lodge
,
to
read
Dr.
Minchin
's
paper
,
and
by
this
mean
become
a
subject
of
compassionate
conversation
in
the
neighboring
shop
of
Churchyard
Lane
as
be
afflict
with
a
tumor
at
first
declare
to
be
as
large
and
hard
as
a
duck
's
egg
,
but
later
in
the
day
to
be
about
the
size
of
"
your
fist
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Most
hearer
agree
that
it
would
have
to
be
cut
out
,
but
one
have
know
of
oil
and
another
of
"
squitchineal
"
as
adequate
to
soften
and
reduce
any
lump
in
the
body
when
take
enough
of

the
inside
 
the
oil
by
gradually
"
soopling

"
the
squitchineal
by
eat
away

<EOS>
meanwhile
when
Nancy
present
herself
at
the
Infirmary
,
it
happen
to
be
one
of
Lydgate
's
day
there
.
 
<EOS>
after
question
and
examine
her
,
Lydgate
say
to
the
house
-
surgeon
in
an
undertone
,
"
It
be
not
tumor
:
it
be
cramp
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
order
her
a
blister
and
some
steel
mixture
,
and
tell
her
to
go
home
and
rest
,
give
her
at
the
same
time
a
note
to
Mrs.
Larcher
,
who
,
she
say
,
be
her
good
employer
,
to
testify
that
she
be
in
need
of
good
food
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
-
and
-
by
Nancy
,
in
her
attic
,
become
portentously
bad
,
the
suppose
tumor
have
indeed
give
way
to
the
blister
,
but
only
wander
to
another
region
with
angrier
pain
.
 
<EOS>
the
staymaker
's
wife
go
to
fetch
Lydgate
,
and
he
continue
for
a
fortnight
to
attend
Nancy
in
her
own
home
,
until
under
his
treatment
she
get
quite
well
and
go
to
work
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
case
continue
to
be
describe
as
one
of
tumor
in
Churchyard
Lane
and
other
street
 
nay
,
by
Mrs.
Larcher
also
;
for
when
Lydgate
's
remarkable
cure
be
mention
to
Dr.
Minchin
,
he
naturally
do
not
like
to
say
,
"
the
case
be
not
one
of
tumor
,
and
I
be
mistaken
in
describe
it
as
such
,
"
but
answer
,
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
be
a
surgical
case
,
not
of
a
fatal
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
be
inwardly
annoy
,
however
,
when
he
have
ask
at
the
Infirmary
about
the
woman
he
have
recommend
two
day
before
,
to
hear
from
the
house
-
surgeon
,
a
youngster
who
be
not
sorry
to
vex
Minchin
with
impunity
,
exactly
what
have
occur
:
he
privately
pronounce
that
it
be
indecent
in
a
general
practitioner
to
contradict
a
physician
's
diagnosis
in
that
open
manner
,
and
afterwards
agree
with
Wrench
that
Lydgate
be
disagreeably
inattentive
to
etiquette
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
make
the
affair
a
ground
for
value
himself
or
<EOS>
(
very
particularly
)
despise
Minchin
,
such
rectification
of
misjudgment
often
happen
among
man
of
equal
qualification
.
 
<EOS>
but
report
take
up
this
amazing
case
of
tumor
,
not
clearly
distinguish
from
cancer
,
and
consider
the
more
awful
for
be
of
the
wander
sort
;
till
much
prejudice
against
Lydgate
's
method
as
to
drug
be
overcome
by
the
proof
of
his
marvellous
skill
in
the
speedy
restoration
of
Nancy
Nash
after
she
have
be
roll
and
roll
in
agony
from
the
presence
of
a
tumor
both
hard
and
obstinate
,
but
nevertheless
compel
to
yield
.
  
<EOS>
how
could
lydgate
help
himself
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
offensive
to
tell
a
lady
when
she
be
express
her
amazement
at
your
skill
,
that
she
be
altogether
mistaken
and
rather
foolish
in
her
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
have
enter
into
the
nature
of
disease
would
only
have
add
to
his
breach
of
medical
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
thus
he
have
to
wince
under
a
promise
of
success
give
by
that
ignorant
praise
which
miss
every
valid
quality
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
a
more
conspicuous
patient
,
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
Lydgate
be
conscious
of
have
show
himself
something
well
than
an
every
-
day
doctor
,
though
here
too
it
be
an
equivocal
advantage
that
he
win
.
 
<EOS>
the
eloquent
auctioneer
be
seize
with
pneumonia
,
and
have
be
a
patient
of
Mr.
Peacock
's
,
send
for
Lydgate
,
whom
he
have
express
his
intention
to
patronize
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Trumbull
be
a
robust
man
,
a
good
subject
for
try
the
expectant
theory
upon
 
watch
the
course
of
an
interesting
disease
when
leave
as
much
as
possible
to
itself
,
so
that
the
stage
may
be
note
for
future
guidance
;
and
from
the
air
with
which
he
describe
his
sensation
Lydgate
surmise
that
he
would
like
to
be
take
into
his
medical
man
's
confidence
,
and
be
represent
as
a
partner
in
his
own
cure
.
 
<EOS>
the
auctioneer
hear
,
without
much
surprise
,
that
his
be
a
constitution
which
(
always
with
due
watch
)
may
be
leave
to
itself
,
so
as
to
offer
a
beautiful
example
of
a
disease
with
all
its
phase
see
in
clear
delineation
,
and
that
he
probably
have
the
rare
strength
of
mind
voluntarily
to
become
the
test
of
a
rational
procedure
,
and
thus
make
the
disorder
of
his
pulmonary
function
a
general
benefit
to
society
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Trumbull
acquiesce
at
once
,
and
enter
strongly
into
the
view
that
an
illness
of
his
be
no
ordinary
occasion
for
medical
science
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
fear
,
sir
;
you
be
not
speak
to
one
who
be
altogether
ignorant
of
the
vis
medicatrix
,
"
say
he
,
with
his
usual
superiority
of
expression
,
make
rather
pathetic
by
difficulty
of
breathing
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
go
without
shrink
through
his
abstinence
from
drug
,
much
sustain
by
application
of
the
thermometer
which
imply
the
importance
of
his
temperature
,
by
the
sense
that
he
furnish
object
for
the
microscope
,
and
by
learn
many
new
word
which
seem
suited
to
the
dignity
of
his
secretion
.
 
<EOS>
for
Lydgate
be
acute
enough
to
indulge
him
with
a
little
technical
talk
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagine
that
Mr.
Trumbull
rise
from
his
couch
with
a
disposition
to
speak
of
an
illness
in
which
he
have
manifest
the
strength
of
his
mind
as
well
as
constitution
;
and
he
be
not
backward
in
award
credit
to
the
medical
man
who
have
discern
the
quality
of
patient
he
have
to
deal
with
.
 
<EOS>
the
auctioneer
be
not
an
ungenerous
man
,
and
like
to
give
other
their
due
,
feel
that
he
could
afford
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
catch
the
word
"
expectant
method
,
"
and
rang
chime
on
this
and
other
learned
phrase
to
accompany
the
assurance
that
Lydgate
"
know
a
thing
or
two
more
than
the
rest
of
the
doctor
 
be
far
better
verse
in
the
secret
of
his
profession
than
the
majority
of
his
compeer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
have
happen
before
the
affair
of
Fred
Vincy
's
illness
have
give
to
Mr.
Wrench
's
enmity
towards
lydgate
more
definite
personal
ground
.
<EOS>
the
new
-
comer
already
threaten
to
be
a
nuisance
in
the
shape
of
rivalry
,
and
be
certainly
a
nuisance
in
the
shape
of
practical
criticism
or
reflection
on
his
hard
-
drive
elder
,
who
have
have
something
else
to
do
than
to
busy
themselves
with
untried
notion
.
 
<EOS>
His
practice
have
spread
in
one
or
two
quarter
,
and
from
the
first
the
report
of
his
high
family
have
lead
to
his
be
pretty
generally
invite
,
so
that
the
other
medical
man
have
to
meet
him
at
dinner
in
the
good
house
;
and
have
to
meet
a
man
whom
you
dislike
be
not
observe
always
to
end
in
a
mutual
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
ever
so
much
unanimity
among
them
as
in
the
opinion
that
Lydgate
be
an
arrogant
young
fellow
,
and
yet
ready
for
the
sake
of
ultimately
predominate
to
show
a
crawl
subservience
to
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Farebrother
,
whose
name
be
a
chief
flag
of
the
anti
-
bulstrode
party
,
always
defend
Lydgate
and
make
a
friend
of
him
,
be
refer
to
Farebrother
's
unaccountable
way
of
fighting
on
both
side
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
plenty
of
preparation
for
the
outburst
of
professional
disgust
at
the
announcement
of
the
law
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
lay
down
for
the
direction
of
the
New
Hospital
,
which
be
the
more
exasperating
because
there
be
no
present
possibility
of
interfere
with
his
will
and
pleasure
,
everybody
except
Lord
Medlicote
have
refuse
help
towards
the
building
,
on
the
ground
that
they
prefer
give
to
the
Old
Infirmary
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
meet
all
the
expense
,
and
have
cease
to
be
sorry
that
he
be
purchase
the
right
to
carry
out
his
notion
of
improvement
without
hindrance
from
prejudiced
coadjutor
;
but
he
have
have
to
spend
large
sum
,
and
the
building
have
linger
.
 
<EOS>
Caleb
Garth
have
undertake
it
,
have
fail
during
its
progress
,
and
before
the
interior
fitting
be
begin
have
retire
from
the
management
of
the
business
;
and
<EOS>
when
refer
to
the
Hospital
he
often
say
that
however
Bulstrode
may
ring
if
you
try
him
,
he
like
good
solid
carpentry
and
masonry
,
and
have
a
notion
both
of
drain
and
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
Hospital
have
become
an
object
of
intense
interest
to
Bulstrode
,
and
he
would
willingly
have
continue
to
spare
a
large
yearly
sum
that
he
may
rule
it
dictatorially
without
any
Board
;
but
he
have
another
favorite
object
which
also
require
money
for
its
accomplishment
:
he
wish
to
buy
some
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
Middlemarch
,
and
therefore
he
wish
to
get
considerable
contribution
towards
maintain
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
frame
his
plan
of
management
.
<EOS>
the
Hospital
be
to
be
reserve
for
fever
in
all
its
form
;
Lydgate
be
to
be
chief
medical
superintendent
,
that
he
may
have
free
authority
to
pursue
all
comparative
investigation
which
his
study
,
particularly
in
Paris
,
have
show
him
the
importance
of
,
the
other
medical
visitor
have
a
consultative
influence
,
but
no
power
to
contravene
Lydgate
's
ultimate
decision
;
and
the
general
management
be
to
be
lodge
exclusively
in
the
hand
of
five
director
associate
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
be
to
have
vote
in
the
ratio
of
their
contribution
,
the
Board
itself
fill
up
any
vacancy
in
its
number
,
and
no
mob
of
small
contributor
be
admit
to
a
share
of
government
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
immediate
refusal
on
the
part
of
every
medical
man
in
the
town
to
become
a
visitor
at
the
Fever
Hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
lydgate
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
"
we
have
a
capital
house

surgeon

a

will
get

as
good
a

as
any

Protheroe

I

work
the
harder

I
have
give
up
my
post
at

will
flourish
in

of
them

then
they
will
be
glad

come
in

can
not
last

they

:
there
must

of
reform
soon

then
young

study
here

Lydgate
be
in
high
spirit

<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
flinch
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Lydgate

Mr.
Bulstrode

while
I
see
you
carry
out
high
intention

you
shall

humble

no

<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
have
already
give
me
his
concurrence
,
and
a
pledge
to
contribute
yearly
<EOS>
:
he
have
not
specify
the
sum
 
probably
not
a
great
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
will
be
a
useful
member
of
the
board

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
useful
member
be
perhaps
to
be
define
as
one
who
would
originate
nothing
,
and
always
vote
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
  
<EOS>
the
medical
aversion
to
Lydgate
be
hardly
disguise
now
.
 
<EOS>
neither
Dr.
Sprague
nor
Dr.
Minchin
say
that
he
dislike
Lydgate
's
knowledge
,
or
his
disposition
to
improve
treatment
:
what
they
dislike
be
his
arrogance
,
which
nobody
feel
to
be
altogether
deniable
.
 
<EOS>
They
imply
that
he
be
insolent
,
pretentious
,
and
give
to
that
reckless
innovation
for
the
sake
of
noise
and
show
which
be
the
essence
of
the
charlatan
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
charlatan
once
throw
on
the
air
could
not
be
let
drop
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
day
the
world
be
agitate
about
the
wondrous
doing
of
Mr.
St.
John
Long
,
"
nobleman
and
gentleman

attest
his
extraction
of
a
fluid
like
mercury
from
the

<EOS>
Mr.

remark
one
day
,
smilingly
,
to
Mrs.
Taft
,
that
"
Bulstrode
have
find
a

yes

I

Mrs.

keep
the

carefully

all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
what
dreadful
trifling
with
people
's
constitution
!
"
say
Mrs.
Taft
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
it
come
to
be
hold
in
various
quarter
that
Lydgate
play
even
with
respectable
constitution
for
his
own
purpose
,
and
how
much
more
likely
that
in
his
flighty
experimenting
he
should
make
six
and
seven
of
hospital
patient
.
 
<EOS>
especially
it
be
to
be
expect
,
as
the
landlady
of
the
Tankard
have
say
,
that
he
would
recklessly
cut
up
their
dead
body
.
 
<EOS>
for
Lydgate
have
attend
Mrs.
Goby
,
who
die
apparently
of
a
heart
-
disease
not
very
clearly
express
in
the
symptom
,
too
daringly
ask
leave
of
her
relative
to
open
the
body
,
and
thus
give
an
offence
quickly
spread
beyond
Parley
Street
,
where
that
lady
have
long
reside
on
an
income
such
as
make
this
association
of
her
body
with
the
victim
of
Burke
and
Hare
a
flagrant
insult
to
her
memory
.
  
<EOS>
affair
be
in
this
stage
when
Lydgate
open
the
subject
of
the
Hospital
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
that
he
be
bear
enmity
and
silly
misconception
with
much
spirit
,
<EOS>
aware
that
they
be
partly
create
by
his
good
share
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
drive
me
away
,
"
he
say
,
talk
confidentially
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
study
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
good
opportunity
here
,
for
the
end
I
care
most
about
;
and
I
be
pretty
sure
to
get
income
enough
for
our
want
.
 
<EOS>
by
-
and
<EOS>
-
by
I
shall
go
on
as
quietly
as
possible
<EOS>
:
I
have
no
seduction
now
away
from
home
and
work
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
more
and
more
convinced
that
it
will
be
possible
to
demonstrate
the
homogeneous
origin
of
all
the
tissue
.
 
<EOS>
Raspail
and
other
be
on
the
same
track
,
and
I
have
be
lose
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
power
of
prophecy
there
,
"
say
Mr.
Farebrother
,
who
have
be
puff
at
his
pipe
thoughtfully
while
Lydgate
talk
;
"
but
as
to
the
hostility
in
the
town
,
you
will
weather
it
if
you
be
prudent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
I
to
be
prudent
?
"
say
Lydgate
,
"
I
just
do
what
come
before
me
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
people
's
ignorance
and
spite
,
any
more
than
Vesalius
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
to
square
one
's
conduct
to
silly
conclusion
which
nobody
can
foresee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
true
;
I
do
not
mean
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
only
two
thing
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
,
keep
yourself
as
separable
from
Bulstrode
as
you
can
:
of
course
,
you
can
go
on
do
good
work
of
your
own
by
his
help
;
but
do
not
get
tie
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
seem
like
personal
feeling
in
me
to
say
so
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
good
deal
of
that
<EOS>
,
I
own
 
but
personal
feeling
be
not
always
in
the
wrong
if
you
boil
it
down
to
the
impression
which
make
it
simply
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bulstrode
be
nothing
to
me
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
carelessly
,
"
except
on
public
ground
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
get
very
closely
united
to
him
,
I
be
not
fond
enough
of
him
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
other
thing
you
mean
?
"
say
Lydgate
,
who
be
nurse
his
leg
as
comfortably
as
possible
,
and
feel
in
no
great
need
of
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
this
.
 
<EOS>
take
care
 
<EOS>
experto
crede
 
<EOS>
take
care
not
to
get
hamper
about
money
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
by
a
word
you
let
fall
one
day
,
that
you
do
not
like
my
playing
at
card
so
much
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
right
enough
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
try
and
keep
clear
of
want
small
sum
that
you
have
not
get
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
perhaps
talk
rather
superfluously
;
but
a
man
like
to
assume
superiority
over
himself
,
by
hold
up
his
bad
example
and
sermonize
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
take
Mr.
Farebrother
's
hint
very
cordially
,
though
he
would
hardly
have
bear
them
from
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
remember
that
he
have
lately
make
some
debt
,
but
these
have
seem
inevitable
,
and
he
have
no
intention
now
to
do
more
than
keep
house
in
a
simple
way
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
for
which
he
owe
would
not
want
renew
;
nor
even
the
stock
of
wine
for
a
long
while
.
  
<EOS>
many
thought
cheer
him
at
that
time
 
and
justly
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
conscious
of
enthusiasm
for
worthy
aim
be
sustain
under
petty
hostility
by
the
memory
of
great
worker
who
have
to
fight
their
way
not
without
wound
,
and
who
hover
in
his
mind
as
patron
saint
,
invisibly
help
.
 
<EOS>
at
home
,
that
same
evening
when
he
have
be
chat
with
Mr.
Farebrother
,
he
have
his
long
leg
stretch
on
the
sofa
,
his
head
throw
back
,
and
his
hand
clasp
behind
it
accord
to
his
favorite
ruminating
attitude
,
while
Rosamond
sit
at
the
piano
,
and
play
one
tune
after
another
,
of
which
her
husband
only
know
(
like
the
emotional
elephant
he
be
!
)
<EOS>
that
they
fall
in
with
his
mood
as
if
they
have
be
melodious
sea
-
breeze
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
very
fine
in
Lydgate
's
look
just
then
,
and
any
one
may
have
be
encourage
to
bet
on
his
achievement
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
dark
eye
and
on
his
mouth
and
brow
there
be
that
placidity
which
come
from
the
fulness
of
contemplative
thought
 
<EOS>
the
mind
not
search
,
but
behold
,
and
the
glance
seem
to
be
fill
with
what
be
behind
it
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Rosamond
leave
the
piano
and
seat
herself
on
a
chair
close
to
the
sofa
and
opposite
her
husband
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
enough
music
for
you
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
fold
her
hand
before
her
and
put
on
a
little
air
of
meekness
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
,
if
you
be
tired
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
gently
,
turn
his
eye
and
rest
them
on
her
,
but
not
otherwise
move
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
's
presence
at
that
moment
be
perhaps
no
more
than
a
spoonful
brought
to
the
lake
,
and
her
woman
's
instinct
in
this
matter
be
not
dull
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
absorb
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
lean
forward
and
bring
her
face
nearer
to
his
.
  
<EOS>
He
move
his
hand
and
place
them
gently
behind
her
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
of
a
great
fellow
,
who
be
about
as
old
as
I
be
three
hundred
year
ago
,
and
have
already
begin
a
new
era
in
anatomy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
guess
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
shake
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
use
to
play
at
guess
historical
character
at
Mrs.
Lemon
's
,
but
not
anatomist
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
Vesalius
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
only
way
he
could
get
to
know
anatomy
as
he
do
,
be
by
go
to
snatch
body
at
night
,
from
graveyard
and
place
of
execution
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
her
pretty
face
,
"
I
be
very
glad
you
be
not
Vesalius
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
he
may
find
some
less
horrible
way
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
could
not
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
go
on
too
earnestly
to
take
much
notice
of
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
could
only
get
a
complete
skeleton
by
snatch
the
whitened
bone
of
a
criminal
from
the
gallow
,
and
bury
them
,
and
fetch
them
away
by
bit
secretly
,
in
the
dead
of
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
be
not
one
of
your
great
hero
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
half
playfully
,
half
anxiously
,
"
else
<EOS>
I
shall
have
you
get
up
in
the
night
to
go
to
St.
Peter
's
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
how
angry
you
tell
me
the
people
be
about
Mrs.
Goby
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
enemy
enough
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
have
Vesalius
,
Rosy
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
the
medical
fogy
in
Middlemarch
be
jealous
,
when
some
of
the
great
doctor
live
be
fierce
upon
Vesalius
because
they
have
believe
in
Galen
,
and
he
show
that
Galen
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
They
call
him
a
liar
and
a
poisonous
monster
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fact
of
the
human
frame
be
on
his
side
;
and
so
he
get
the
well
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
happen
to
him
afterwards
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
some
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
have
a
good
deal
of
fighting
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
do
exasperate
him
enough
at
one
time
to
make
him
burn
a
good
deal
of
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
get
shipwreck
just
as
he
be
come
from
Jerusalem
to
take
a
great
chair
at
Padua

<EOS>
He
die
rather
miserably

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
's
pause
before
Rosamond
say
,
"
do
you
know

Tertius
,
I
often
wish
you

"
Nay

Rosy
,
do
not

that
,

draw
her
closer
to
him

"
that
be
like

you
wish
you
have
marry
another
man

"
not
at
all

you
be
clever
enough
for
anything

you
may
easily
have
be
something
else

and
your

may
go
to

devil

<EOS>
say
Lydgate
,
with
scorn

<EOS>
"
It
be
like
their
impudence
if
they
say
anything

still

Rosamond

I

to

Reform
against

Middlemarch
be
become
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
national
struggle
for

of

<EOS>
by
the
time
that
Lord

's
measure
be
be
debate
in
the
House
of

,
there
be
a
new
political
animation
in
Middlemarch

a
new
definition
of
party
which
may
show
a
decide
change
of
balance
if
a

come

there
be
some
who
already
predict

declare
that

never

this

what

dwelt
on

"
only
I
want
to

myself
independent

<EOS>
and
as
to
contend
for
a
reform
short
of
that

it
be

ask
for
a
bit

an
avalanche

write
that
down

now

<EOS>
We
must
begin
to
get
document
about
the
feeling

as
well

a

a
few
row
of
figure
be
enough
to
deduce
misery
from

the

good
:
draw
that

that

an
idea

now

write
it
out
in

put
the

on

<EOS>
Burke
,
now
:
 
when
I
think
of
Burke
,
I
can
not
help
wish
somebody
have
a
pocket

borough
to
give
you

You
would
never

you

and
we
shall
always
want
talent
in

:
reform
as
we
will
,
we
shall
always
want
talent
.
<EOS>
that
avalanche
and
the
thunder
,
now
,
be
really
a
little
like
Burke
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
that
sort
of
thing
 
not
idea
,
you
know
,
but
a
way
of
put
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
pocket
-
borough
would
be
a
fine
thing
,
"
say
Ladislaw
,
"
if
they
be
always
in
the
right
pocket
,
and
there
be
always
a
Burke
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
will
be
not
displease
with
that
complimentary
comparison
,
even
from
Mr.
Brooke
;
for
it
be
a
little
too
try
to
human
flesh
to
be
conscious
of
express
one
's
self
better
than
other
and
never
to
have
it
notice
,
and
in
the
general
dearth
of
admiration
for
the
right
thing
,
even
a
chance
bray
of
applause
fall
exactly
in
time
be
rather
fortify
.
 
<EOS>
Will
feel
that
his
literary
refinement
be
usually
beyond
the
limit
of
Middlemarch
perception
;
nevertheless
,
he
be
begin
thoroughly
to
like
the
work
of
which
when
he
begin
he
have
say
to
himself
rather
languidly
,
"
why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
study
the
political
situation
with
as
ardent
an
interest
as
he
have
ever
give
to
poetic
metre
or
mediaevalism
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
undeniable
that
but
for
the
desire
to
be
where
Dorothea
be
,
and
perhaps
the
want
of
know
what
else
to
do
,
Will
would
not
at
this
time
have
be
meditate
on
the
need
of
the
english
people
or
criticise
english
statesmanship
:
he
would
probably
have
be
ramble
in
Italy
sketching
plan
for
several
drama
,
try
prose
and
find
it
too
jejune
,
try
verse
and
find
it
too
artificial
,
begin
to
copy
"
bit
"
from
old
picture
,
leave
off
because
they
be
"
no
good
,
"
and
observe
that
,
after
all
,
self
-
culture
be
the
principal
point
;
while
in
politic
he
would
have
be
sympathize
warmly
with
liberty
and
progress
in
general
.
 
<EOS>
Our
sense
of
duty
must
often
wait
for
some
work
which
shall
take
the
place
of
dilettanteism
and
make
us
feel
that
the
quality
of
our
action
be
not
a
matter
of
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
Ladislaw
have
now
accept
his
bit
of
work
,
though
it
be
not
that
indeterminate
lofty
thing
which
he
have
once
dream
of
as
alone
worthy
of
continuous
effort
.
 
<EOS>
His
nature
warm
easily
in
the
presence
of
subject
which
be
visibly
mixed
with
life
and
action
,
and
the
easily
stir
rebellion
in
him
help
the
glow
of
public
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
Mr.
Casaubon
and
the
banishment
from
Lowick
,
he
be
rather
happy
;
get
a
great
deal
of
fresh
knowledge
in
a
vivid
way
and
for
practical
purpose
,
and
make
the
"
Pioneer
"
celebrate
as
far
as
brasse
(
never
mind
the
smallness
of
the
area
;
the
writing
be
not
bad
than
much
that
reach
the
four
corner
of
the
earth
)
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
be
occasionally
irritate
;
but
Will
's
impatience
be
relieve
by
the
division
of
his
time
between
visit
to
the
Grange
and
retreat
to
his
Middlemarch
lodging
,
which
give
variety
to
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
shift
the
peg
a
little
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
and
Mr.
Brooke
may
be
in
the
Cabinet
,
while
I
be
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
common
order
of
thing
:
the
little
wave
make
the
large
one
and
be
of
the
same
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
well
here
than
in
the
sort
of
life
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
would
have
train
me
for
,
where
the
do
would
be
all
lay
down
by
a
precedent
too
rigid
for
me
to
react
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
prestige
or
high
pay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
Lydgate
have
say
of
him
,
he
be
a
sort
of
gypsy
,
rather
enjoy
the
sense
of
belong
to
no
class
;
he
have
a
feeling
of
romance
in
his
position
,
and
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
create
a
little
surprise
wherever
he
go
.
 
<EOS>
that
sort
of
enjoyment
have
be
disturb
when
he
have
feel
some
new
distance
between
himself
and
Dorothea
in
their
accidental
meeting
at
Lydgate
's
,
and
his
irritation
have
go
out
towards
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
have
declare
beforehand
that
Will
would
lose
caste
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
any
caste
,
"
he
would
have
say
,
if
that
prophecy
have
be
utter
to
him
,
and
the
quick
blood
would
have
come
and
go
like
breath
in
his
transparent
skin
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
one
thing
to
like
defiance
,
and
another
thing
to
like
its
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
town
opinion
about
the
new
editor
of
the
"
Pioneer
"
be
tend
to
confirm
Mr.
Casaubon
's
view
.
 
<EOS>
Will
's
relationship
in
that
distinguished
quarter
do
not
,
like
Lydgate
's
high
connection
,
serve
as
an
advantageous
introduction
:
if
it
be
rumor
that
young
Ladislaw
be
Mr.
Casaubon
's
nephew
or
cousin
,
it
be
also
rumor
that
"
Mr.
Casaubon
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brooke
have
take
him
up
,
"
say
Mr.
Hawley
,
"
because
that
be
what
no
man
in
his
sense
could
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Casaubon
have
devilish
good
reason
,
you
may
be
sure
,
for
turn
the
cold
shoulder
on
a
young
fellow
whose
bringing
-
up
he
pay
for
.
 
<EOS>
just
like
Brooke
 
one
of
those
fellow
who
would
praise
a
cat
to
sell
a
horse
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
some
oddity
of
Will
's
,
more
or
less
poetical
,
appear
to
support
Mr.
Keck
,
the
editor
of
the
"
Trumpet
,
"
in
assert
that
Ladislaw
,
if
the
truth
be
know
,
be
not
only
a
polish
emissary
but
crack
-
brained
,
which
account
for
the
preternatural
quickness
and
glibness
of
his
speech
when
he
get
on
to
a
platform
 
as
he
do
whenever
he
have
an
opportunity
,
speak
with
a
facility
which
cast
reflection
on
solid
Englishmen
generally
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
disgusting
to
Keck
to
see
a
strip
of
a
fellow
,
with
light
curl
round
his
head
,
get
up
and
speechify
by
the
hour
against
institution
"
which
have
exist
when
he
be
in
his
cradle
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
in
a
lead
article
of
the
"
Trumpet
,
"
Keck
characterize
Ladislaw
's
speech
at
a
Reform
meeting
as
"
the
violence
of
an
energuman
 
a
miserable
effort
to
shroud
in
the
brilliancy
of
firework
the
daring
of
irresponsible
statement
and
the
poverty
of
a
knowledge
which
be
of
the
cheap
and
most
recent
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
rattle
article
yesterday
,
Keck
,
"
say
Dr.
Sprague
,
with
sarcastic
intention
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
an
energuman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
a
term
that
come
up
in
the
French
Revolution
,
"
say
Keck
.
  
<EOS>
this
dangerous
aspect
of
Ladislaw
be
strangely
contrast
with
other
habit
which
become
matter
of
remark
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
fondness
,
half
artistic
,
half
affectionate
,
for
little
child
 
<EOS>
the
small
they
be
on
tolerably
active
leg
,
and
the
funny
their
clothing
<EOS>
,
the
well
Will
like
to
surprise
and
please
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
that
in
Rome
he
be
give
to
ramble
about
among
the
poor
people
,
and
the
taste
do
not
quit
him
in
Middlemarch
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
somehow
pick
up
a
troop
of
droll
child
,
little
hatless
boy
with
their
galligaskin
much
worn
and
scant
shirt
to
hang
out
,
little
girl
who
toss
their
hair
out
of
their
eye
to
look
at
him
,
and
guardian
brother
at
the
mature
age
of
seven
.
 
<EOS>
this
troop
he
have
lead
out
on
gypsy
excursion
to
Halsell
Wood
at
nutting
-
time
,
and
since
the
cold
weather
have
set
in
he
have
take
them
on
a
clear
day
to
gather
stick
for
a
bonfire
in
the
hollow
of
a
hillside
,
where
he
draw
out
a
small
feast
of
gingerbread
for
them
,
and
improvise
a
Punch
-
and
-
Judy
drama
with
some
private
home
-
make
puppet
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
one
oddity
.
<EOS>
another
be
,
that
in
house
where
he
get
friendly
,
he
be
give
to
stretch
himself
at
full
length
on
the
rug
while
he
talk
,
and
be
apt
to
be
discover
in
this
attitude
by
occasional
caller
for
whom
such
an
irregularity
be
likely
to
confirm
the
notion
of
his
dangerously
mixed
blood
and
general
laxity
.
  
<EOS>
but
Will
's
article
and
speech
naturally
recommend
him
in
family
which
the
new
strictness
of
party
division
have
mark
off
on
the
side
of
Reform
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
invite
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
;
but
here
he
could
not
lie
down
on
the
rug
,
and
Mrs.
Bulstrode
feel
that
his
mode
of
talk
about
catholic
country
,
as
if
there
be
any
truce
with
Antichrist
,
illustrate
the
usual
tendency
to
unsoundness
in
intellectual
man
.
  
<EOS>
at
Mr.
Farebrother
's
,
however
,
whom
the
irony
of
event
have
bring
on
the
same
side
with
Bulstrode
in
the
national
movement
<EOS>
,
Will
become
a
favorite
with
the
lady
;
especially
with
little
Miss
Noble
,
whom
it
be
one
of
his
oddity
to
escort
when
he
meet
her
in
the
street
with
her
little
basket
,
give
her
his
arm
in
the
eye
of
the
town
,
and
insist
on
go
with
her
to
pay
some
call
where
she
distribute
her
small
filching
from
her
own
share
of
sweet
thing
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
house
where
he
visit
oftenest
and
lie
most
on
the
rug
be
Lydgate
's
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
not
at
all
alike
,
but
they
agree
none
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
abrupt
but
not
irritable
,
take
little
notice
of
megrim
in
healthy
people
;
and
Ladislaw
do
not
usually
throw
away
his
susceptibility
on
those
who
take
no
notice
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
Rosamond
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
pout
and
be
wayward
 
<EOS>
nay
,
often
uncomplimentary
,
much
to
her
inward
surprise
;
nevertheless
he
be
gradually
become
necessary
to
her
entertainment
by
his
companionship
in
her
music
,
his
varied
talk
,
and
his
freedom
from
the
grave
preoccupation
which
,
with
all
her
husband
's
tenderness
and
indulgence
,
often
make
his
manner
unsatisfactory
to
her
,
and
confirm
her
dislike
of
the
medical
profession
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate

incline
to
be
sarcastic

superstitious
faith

He
would
disappoint

see

good

make
up
their
mind

make
it
up

they
do
not
want
a

they
only
want
a
vote

that

the
way
with

political
writer

cry
up
a
measure
as
if
it
be

universal
cure

up

could
find

impromptu

beforehand

<EOS>
"
that
be
no
excuse

encourage
the
superstitious
exaggeration

help
the
cry

it

<EOS>
You
go
against
rottenness

there
be
nothing
more
thoroughly
rotten
than
make
people
believe
that
society
can
be
cure

hocus
-
pocus

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
fine
,
my
dear
fellow

your
cure
must
begin
somewhere

it
that
a
thousand
thing

debase
a

can
never
be
reform
without
this
particular
reform

look
what
Stanley
say
the
other

that
the

be
tinker
long

the

we

<EOS>
It
happen
to
be
on
a
Saturday
evening
that
Will
Ladislaw
have
that
little
discussion
with
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
Its
effect
when
he
go
to
his
own
room
be
to
make
him
sit
up
half
the
night
,
think
over
again
,
under
a
new
irritation
,
all
that
he
have
before
thought
of
his
have
settle
in
Middlemarch
and
harness
himself
with
Mr.
Brooke
.
 
<EOS>
hesitation
before
he
have
take
the
step
have
since
turn
into
susceptibility
to
every
hint
that
he
would
have
be
wise
not
to
take
it
;
and
hence
come
his
heat
towards
Lydgate
 
<EOS>
a
heat
which
still
keep
him
restless
.
 
<EOS>
be
he
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
?
 
<EOS>
and
at
a
time
when
he
be
more
than
ever
conscious
of
be
something
well
than
a
fool
?
 
<EOS>
and
for
what
end
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
for
no
definite
end
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
he
have
dreamy
vision
of
possibility
:
there
be
no
human
be
who
have
both
passion
and
thought
do
not
think
in
consequence
of
his
passion
 
do
not
find
image
rise
in
his
mind
which
soothe
the
passion
with
hope
or
ste
it
with
dread
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
,
which
happen
to
us
all
,
happen
to
some
with
a
wide
difference
;
and
Will
be
not
one
of
those
whose
wit
"
keep
the
roadway
:
"
he
have
his
bypath
where
there
be
little
joy
of
his
own
choosing
,
such
as
gentleman
canter
on
the
highroad
may
have
think
rather
idiotic
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
in
which
he
make
a
sort
of
happiness
for
himself
out
of
his
feeling
for
Dorothea
be
an
example
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
,
but
it
be
the
fact
,
that
the
ordinary
vulgar
vision
of
which
Mr.
Casaubon
suspect
him
 
namely
,
that
Dorothea
may
become
a
widow
,
and
that
the
interest
he
have
establish
in
her
mind
may
turn
into
acceptance
of
him
as
a
husband
 
have
no
tempting
,
arrest
power
over
him
;
he
do
not
live
in
the
scenery
of
such
an
event
,
and
follow
it
out
,
as
we
all
do
with
that
imagine
"
otherwise
"
which
be
our
practical
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
that
he
be
unwilling
to
entertain
thought
which
could
be
accuse
of
baseness
,
and
be
already
uneasy
in
the
sense
that
he
have
to
justify
himself
from
the
charge
of
ingratitude
 
<EOS>
the
latent
consciousness
of
many
other
barrier
between
himself
and
Dorothea
besides
the
existence
of
her
husband
,
have
help
to
turn
away
his
imagination
from
speculate
on
what
may
befall
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
yet
other
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Will
,
we
know
,
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
any
flaw
appear
in
his
crystal
:
he
be
at
once
exasperate
and
delight
by
the
calm
freedom
with
which
Dorothea
look
at
him
and
speak
to
him
,
and
there
be
something
so
exquisite
in
thinking
of
her
just
as
she
be
,
that
he
could
not
long
for
a
change
which
must
somehow
change
her
.
 
<EOS>
do
we
not
shun
the
street
version
of
a
fine
melody
?
 
or
shrink
from
the
news
that
the
rarity
 
some
bit
of
chisel
or
engrave
perhaps
 
which
we
have
dwell
on
even
with
exultation
in
the
trouble
it
have
cost
us
to
snatch
glimpse
of
it
,
be
really
not
an
uncommon
thing
,
and
may
be
obtain
as
an
every
-
day
possession
?
 
<EOS>
Our
good
depend
on
the
quality
and
breadth
of
our
emotion
;
and
to
Will
,
a
creature
who
care
little
for
what
be
call
the
solid
thing
of
life
and
greatly
for
its
subtler
influence
,
to
have
within
him
such
a
feeling
as
he
have
towards
Dorothea
,
<EOS>
be
like
the
inheritance
of
a
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
what
other
may
have
call
the
futility
of
his
passion
,
make
an
additional
delight
for
his
imagination
:
he
be
conscious
of
a
generous
movement
,
and
of
verify
in
his
own
experience
that
high
love
-
poetry
which
have
charm
his
fancy
.
<EOS>
Dorothea
,
he
say
to
himself
,
be
forever
enthrone
in
his
soul
:
no
other
woman
could
sit
high
than
her
footstool
;
and
if
he
could
have
write
out
in
immortal
syllable
the
effect
she
work
within
him
,
he
may
have
boast
after
the
example
of
old
Drayton
,
that
,
            
"
Queens
hereafter
may
be
glad
to
live
         
upon
the
alm
of
her
superfluous
praise
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
this
result
be
questionable
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
else
could
he
do
for
Dorothea
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
his
devotion
worth
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
out
of
her
reach
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
no
creature
among
her
friend
to
whom
he
could
believe
that
she
speak
with
the
same
simple
confidence
as
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
once
say
that
she
would
like
him
to
stay
;
and
stay
<EOS>
he
would
,
whatever
fire
-
breathing
dragon
may
hiss
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
always
be
the
conclusion
of
Will
's
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
without
contradictoriness
and
rebellion
even
towards
his
own
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
often
get
irritate
,
as
he
be
on
this
particular
night
,
by
some
outside
demonstration
that
his
public
exertion
with
Mr.
Brooke
as
a
chief
could
not
seem
as
heroic
as
he
would
like
them
to
be
,
and
this
be
always
associate
with
the
other
ground
of
irritation
 
that
notwithstanding
his
sacrifice
of
dignity
for
Dorothea
's
sake
,
he
could
hardly
ever
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
not
be
able
to
contradict
these
unpleasant
fact
,
he
contradict
his
own
strong
bias
and
say
,
"
I
be
a
fool
.
"
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
since
the
inward
debate
necessarily
turn
on
Dorothea
,
he
end
,
as
he
have
do
before
,
only
by
get
a
lively
sense
of
what
her
presence
would
be
to
him
;
and
suddenly
reflect
that
the
morrow
would
be
Sunday
,
he
determine
to
go
to
Lowick
Church
and
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
sleep
upon
that
idea
,
but
when
he
be
dress
in
the
rational
morning
light

It

smart
a

be
oblige

do

I
have
always
like
the
quaintness
of
the
church
and
congregation
;
besides
,
I
know
the
Tuckers
:
I
shall
go
into
their
pew

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
silence
Objection
by
force
of
unreason
,
Will
walk
to
Lowick
as
if
he
have
be
on
the
way
to
Paradise
,
cross
Halsell
Common
and
skirt
the
wood
,
where
the
sunlight
fall
broadly
under
the
bud
bough
,
bring
out
the
beauty
of
moss
and
lichen
,
and
fresh
green
growth
pierce
the
brown
.
 
<EOS>
everything
seem
to
know
that
it
be
Sunday
,
and
to
approve
of
his
go
to
Lowick
Church
.
 
<EOS>
Will
easily
feel
happy
when
nothing
cross
his
humor
,
and
by
this
time
the
thought
of
vex
Mr.
Casaubon
have
become
rather
amusing
to
him
,
make
his
face
break
into
its
merry
smile
,
pleasant
to
see
as
the
breaking
of
sunshine
on
the
water
 
though
the
occasion
be
not
exemplary
.
 
<EOS>
but
most
of
us
be
apt
to
settle
within
ourselves
that
the
man
who
block
our
way
be
odious
,
and
not
to
mind
cause
him
a
little
of
the
disgust
which
his
personality
excite
in
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Will
go
along
with
a
small
book
under
his
arm
and
a
hand
in
each
side
-
pocket
,
never
read
,
but
chant
a
little
,
as
he
make
scene
of
what
would
happen
in
church
and
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
experiment
in
tune
to
suit
some
word
of
his
own
,
sometimes
try
a
ready
-
make
melody
,
sometimes
improvising
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
be
not
exactly
a
hymn
,
but
they
certainly
fit
his
Sunday
experience
:
            
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

me

what
frugal

a

"
  
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
he
take
off
his
hat
,
shake
his
head
backward
,
and
show
his
delicate
throat
as
he
sing
,
he
look
like
an
incarnation
of
the
spring
whose
spirit
fill
the
air
 
<EOS>
a
bright
creature
,
abundant
in
uncertain
promise

<EOS>
the
bell
be

when
he
get
to
Lowick
,
and
he
go
into
the
curate
's
pew
before
any
one
else
arrive
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
still
leave
alone
in
it
when
the
congregation
have
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
the
curate
's
pew
be
opposite
the
rector
be
at
the
entrance
of
the
small
chancel
,
and
Will
have
time
to
fear
that
Dorothea
may
not
come
while
he
look
round
at
the
group
of
rural
face
which
make
the
congregation
from
year
to
year
within
the
white
-
washed
wall
and
dark
old
pew
,
hardly
with
more
change
than
we
see
in
the
bough
of
a
tree
which
break
here
and
there
with
age
,
but
yet
have
young
shoot
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Rigg
's
frog
-
face
be
something
alien
and
unaccountable
,
but
notwithstanding
this
shock
to
the
order
of
thing
,
there
be
still
the
Waules
and
the
rural
stock
of
the
Powderells
in
their
pews
side
by
side
;
brother
Samuel
's
cheek
have
the
same
purple
round
as
ever
,
and
the
three
generation
of
decent
cottager
come
as
of
old
with
a
sense
of
duty
to
their
better
<EOS>
generally
 
the
small
child
regard
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
wear
the
black
gown
and
mount
to
the
high
box
,
as
probably
the
chief
of
all
better
,
and
the
one
most
awful
if
offend
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
1831
Lowick
be
at
peace
,
not
more
agitate
by
reform
than
by
the
solemn
tenor
of
the
Sunday
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
the
congregation
have
be
use
to
see
Will
at
church
in
former
day
,
and
no
one
take
much
note
of
him
except
the
choir
,
who
expect
him
to
make
a
figure
in
the
singing
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
do
at
last
appear
on
this
quaint
background
,
walk
up
the
short
aisle
in
her
white
beaver
bonnet
and
gray
cloak
 
<EOS>
the
same
she
have
wear
in
the
Vatican
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
be
,
from
her
entrance
,
towards
the
chancel
,
even
her
shortsighted
eye
soon
discern
Will
,
but
there
be
no
outward
show
of
her
feeling
except
a
slight
paleness
and
a
grave
bow
as
she
pass
him
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
own
surprise
Will
feel
suddenly
uncomfortable
,
and
dare
not
look
at
her
after
they
have
bow
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
two
minute
later
,
when
Mr.
Casaubon
come
out
of
the
vestry
,
and
,
enter
the
pew
,
seat
himself
in
face
of
Dorothea
,
Will
feel
his
paralysis
more
complete
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
look
nowhere
except
at
the
choir
in
the
little
gallery
over
the
vestry
-
door
:
Dorothea
be
perhaps
pain
,
and
he
have
make
a
wretched
blunder
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
amusing
to
vex
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
have
the
advantage
probably
of
watch
him
and
see
that
he
dare
not
turn
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
imagine
this
beforehand
?
 
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
expect
that
he
should
sit
in
that
square
pew
alone
,
unrelieve
by
any
Tuckers
,
who
have
apparently
depart
from
Lowick
altogether
,
for
a
new
clergyman
be
in
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
still
he
call
himself
stupid
now
for
not
foresee
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
look
towards
Dorothea
 
nay
,
that
she
may
feel
his
come
an
impertinence
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
deliver
himself
from
his
cage
,
however
;
and
Will
find
his
place
and
look
at
his
book
as
if
he
have
be
a
school
-
mistress
,
feel
that
the
morning
service
have
never
be
so
immeasurably
long
before
,
that
he
be
utterly
ridiculous
,
out
of
temper
,
and
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
what
a
man
get
by
worship
the
sight
of
a
woman
!
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
observe
with
surprise
that
Mr.
Ladislaw
do
not
join
in
the
tune
of
Hanover
,
and
reflect
that
he
may
have
a
cold
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
do
not
preach
that
morning
,
and
there
be
no
change
in
Will
's
situation
until
the
blessing
have
be
pronounce
and
every
one
rise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
fashion
at
Lowick
for
"
the
better
"
to
go
out
first
.
<EOS>
with
a
sudden
determination
to
break
the
spell
that
be
upon
him
,
Will
look
straight
at
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
gentleman
's
eye
be
on
the
button
of
the
pew
-
door
,
which
he
open
,
allow
Dorothea
to
pass
,
and
follow
her
immediately
without
raise
his
eyelid
.
 
<EOS>
Will
's
glance
have
catch
Dorothea
's
as
she
turn
out
of
the
pew
,
and
again
she
bow
,
but
this
time
with
a
look
of
agitation
,
as
if
she
be
repress
tear
.
 
<EOS>
Will
walk
out
after
them
,
but
they
go
on
towards
the
little
gate
lead
out
of
the
churchyard
into
the
shrubbery
,
never
look
round
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
follow
them
,
and
he
could
only
walk
back
sadly
at
mid
-
day
along
the
same
road
which
he
have
trodden
hopefully
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
be
all
change
for
him
both
without
and
within
.
        
<EOS>
surely
the
golden
hour
be
turn
gray
    
<EOS>
and
dance
no
more
,
and
vainly
strive
to
run
:
    
<EOS>
I
see
their
white
lock
stream
in
the
wind
      
<EOS>
each
face
be
haggard
as
it
look
at
me
,
    
slow
turn
in
the
constant
clasping
round
    
Storm
-
drive
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
distress
when
she
be
leave
the
church
come
chiefly
from
the
perception
that
Mr.
Casaubon
be
determine
not
to
speak
to
his
cousin
,
and
that
Will
's
presence
at
church
have
serve
to
mark
more
strongly
the
alienation
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Will
's
come
seem
to
her
quite
excusable
,
nay
,
she
think
it
an
amiable
movement
in
him
towards
a
reconciliation
which
she
herself
have
be
constantly
wish
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
probably
imagine
,
as
she
have
,
that
if
Mr.
Casaubon
and
he
could
meet
easily
,
they
would
shake
hand
and
friendly
intercourse
may
return
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
Dorothea
feel
quite
rob
of
that
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
banish
further
than
ever
,
for
Mr.
Casaubon
must
have
be
newly
embitter
by
this
thrusting
upon
him
of
a
presence
which
he
refuse
to
recognize
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
very
well
that
morning
,
suffer
from
some
difficulty
in
breathing
,
and
have
not
preach
in
consequence
;
she
be
not
surprised
,
therefore
,
that
he
be
nearly
silent
at
luncheon
,
still
less
that
he
make
no
allusion
to
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
for
her
own
part
she
feel
that
she
could
never
again
introduce
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
They
usually
spend
apart
the
hour
between
luncheon
and
dinner
on
a
Sunday
;
Mr.
Casaubon
in
the
library
doze
chiefly
,
and
Dorothea
in
her
boudoir
,
where
she
be
will
not
to
occupy
herself
with
some
of
her
favorite
book
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
heap
of
them
on
the
table
in
the
bow
-
window
 
of
various
sort
,
from
Herodotus
,
which
she
be
learn
to
read
with
Mr.
Casaubon
,
to
her
old
companion
Pascal
,
and
Keble
's
"
Christian
Year
.
"
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
open
one
after
another
,
and
could
read
none
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
seem
dreary
:
the
portent
before
the
birth
of
Cyrus
 
<EOS>
jewish
antiquity
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
devout
epigram
 
the
sacred
chime
of
favorite
hymn
 
all
alike
be
as
flat
as
tune
beat
on
wood
:
even
the
spring
flower
and
the
grass
have
a
dull
shiver
in
them
under
the
afternoon
cloud
that
hide
the
sun
fitfully
;
even
the
sustain
thought
which
have
become
habit
seem
to
have
in
them
the
weariness
of
long
future
day
in
which
she
would
still
live
with
them
for
her
sole
companion
.
<EOS>
It
be
another
or
rather
a
full
sort
of
companionship
that
poor
Dorothea
be
hunger
for
,
and
the
hunger
have
grow
from
the
perpetual
effort
demand
by
her
married
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
try
to
be
what
her
husband
wish
,
and
never
able
to
repose
on
his
delight
in
what
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
thing
that
she
like
,
that
she
spontaneously
care
to
have
,
seem
to
be
always
exclude
from
her
life
;
for
if
it
be
only
grant
and
not
share
by
her
husband
it
may
as
well
have
be
deny
.
 
<EOS>
about
Will
Ladislaw
there
have
be
a
difference
between
them
from
the
first
,
and
it
have
end
,
since
Mr.
Casaubon
have
so
severely
repulse
Dorothea
's
strong
feeling
about
his
claim
on
the
family
property
,
by
her
be
convince
that
she
be
in
the
right
and
<EOS>
her
husband
in
the
wrong
,
but
that
she
be
helpless
.
 
<EOS>
this
afternoon
the
helplessness
be
more
wretchedly
benumb
than
ever
<EOS>
:
she
long
for
object
who
could
be
dear
to
her
,
and
to
whom
she
could
be
dear
.
 
<EOS>
She
long
for
work
which
would
be
directly
beneficent
like
the
sunshine
and
the
rain
,
and
now
it
appear
that
she
be
to
live
more
and
more
in
a
virtual
tomb
,
where
there
be
the
apparatus
of
a
ghastly
labor
produce
what
would
never
see
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
today
she
have
stand
at
the
door
of
the
tomb
and
see
Will
ladislaw
recede
into
the
distant
world
of
warm
activity
and
fellowship
 
turn
his
face
towards
her
as
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
book
be
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
think
be
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Sunday
,
and
she
could
not
have
the
carriage
to
go
to
Celia
,
who
have
lately
have
a
baby
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
refuge
now
from
spiritual
emptiness
and
discontent
,
and
Dorothea
have
to
bear
her
bad
mood
,
as
she
would
have
bear
a
headache
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
at
the
hour
when
she
usually
begin
to
read
aloud
,
Mr.
Casaubon
propose
that
they
should
go
into
the
library
,
where
,
he
say
,
he
have
order
a
fire
and
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
revive
,
and
to
be
think
intently
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
library
Dorothea
observe
that
he
have
newly
arrange
a
row
of
his
note
-
book
on
a
table
,
and
now
he
take
up
and
put
into
her
hand
a
well
-
know
volume
,
which
be
a
table
of
content
to
all
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
oblige
me
,
my
dear
,
"
he
say
,
seat
himself
,
"
if
instead
of
other
reading
this
evening
,
you
will
go
through
this
aloud
,
pencil
in
hand
,
and
at
each
point
where
I
say
"
mark
,
"
will
make
a
cross
with
your
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
step
in
a
sift
process
which
I
have
long
have
in
view
,
and
as
we
go
on
I
shall
be
able
to
indicate
to
you
certain
principle
of
selection
whereby
you
will
,
I
trust
,
have
an
intelligent
participation
in
my
purpose
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
only
one
more
sign
add
to
many
since
his
memorable
interview
with
Lydgate
,
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
original
reluctance
to
let
Dorothea
work
with
him
have
give
place
to
the
contrary
disposition
,
namely
,
to
demand
much
interest
and
labor
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
after
she
have
read
and
mark
for
two
hour
,
he
say
,
"
We
will
take
the
volume
up
-
stair
 
and
the
pencil
,
if
you
please
 
and
in
case
of
read
in
the
night
,
we
can
pursue
this
task
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
wearisome
to
you
,
I
trust
,
Dorothea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
always
read
what
you
like
best
to
hear
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
who
tell
the
simple
truth
;
for
what
she
dread
be
to
exert
herself
in
reading
or
anything
else
which
leave
him
as
joyless
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
proof
of
the
force
with
which
certain
characteristic
in
Dorothea
impress
those
around
her
,
that
her
husband
,
with
all
his
jealousy
and
suspicion
,
have
gather
implicit
trust
in
the
integrity
of
her
promise
,
and
her
power
of
devote
herself
to
her
idea
of
the
right
and
good
.
 
<EOS>
of
late
he
have
begin
to
feel
that
these
quality
be
a
peculiar
possession
for
himself
,
and
he
want
to
engross
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
reading
in
the
night
do
come
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
in
her
young
weariness
have
sleep
soon
and
fast
:
she
be
awaken
by
a
sense
of
light
,
which
seem
to
her
at
first
like
a
sudden
vision
of
sunset
after
she
have
climb
a
steep
hill
:
she
open
her
eye
and
see
her
husband
wrap
in
his
warm
gown
seat
himself
in
the
arm
-
chair
near
the
fire
-
place
where
the
ember
be
still
glow
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
light
two
candle
,
expect
that
Dorothea
would
awake
,
but
not
like
to
rouse
her
by
more
direct
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
ill
,
Edward
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
rise
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
some
uneasiness
in
a
reclining
posture
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
sit
here
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
throw
wood
on
the
fire
,
wrap
herself
up
,
and
say
,
"
You
would
like
me
to
read
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
oblige
me
greatly
by
do
so
,
Dorothea
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
a
shade
more
meekness
than
usual
in
his
polite
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
wakeful
:
my
mind
be
remarkably
lucid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
that
the
excitement
may
be
too
great
for
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
remember
Lydgate
's
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
not
conscious
of
undue
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
be
easy
.
"
<EOS>
Dorothea
dare
not
insist
,
and
she
read
for
an
hour
or
more
on
the
same
plan
as
she
have
do
in
the
evening
,
but
get
over
the
page
with
more
quickness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mind
be
more
alert
,
and
he
seem
to
anticipate
what
be
come
after
a
very
slight
verbal
indication
,
say
,
"
that
will
do
 
mark
that
"
 
or
"
pass
on
to
the
next
head
 
I
omit
the
second
excursus
on
Crete
.
<EOS>
"
Dorothea
be
amazed
to
think
of
the
bird
-
like
speed
with
which
his
mind
be
survey
the
ground
where
it
have
be
creep
for
year
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
    
"
close
the
book
now
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
resume
our
work
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
defer
it
too
long
,
and
would
gladly
see
it
complete
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
observe
that
the
principle
on
which
my
selection
be
make
,
be
to
give
adequate
,
and
not
disproportionate
illustration
to
each
of
the
thesis
enumerate
in
my
introduction
,
as
at
present
sketch
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
perceive
that
distinctly
,
Dorothea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
rather
tremulously
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
sick
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
I
think
that
I
can
take
some
repose
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
down
again
and
beg
her
to
put
out
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
lain
down
too
,
and
there
be
a
darkness
only
break
by
a
dull
glow
on
the
hearth
,
he
say
    
"
before
I
sleep
,
I
have
a
request
to
make
,
Dorothea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
dread
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
that
you
will
let
me
know
,
deliberately
,
whether
,
in
case
of
my
death
,
you
will
carry
out
my
wish
:
whether
you
will
avoid
do
what
I
should
deprecate
,
and
apply
yourself
to
do
what
I
should
desire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
not
take
by
surprise
:
many
incident
have
be
lead
her
to
the
conjecture
of
some
intention
on
her
husband
's
part
which
may
make
a
new
yoke
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
refuse
?
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
more
edge
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
yet
refuse
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
in
a
clear
voice
,
the
need
of
freedom
assert
itself
within
her
;
"
but
it
be
too
solemn
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
not
right
 
to
make
a
promise
when
I
be
ignorant
what
it
will
bind
me
to
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
affection
prompt
I
would
do
without
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
would
use
your
own
judgment
:
I
ask
you
to
obey
mine
;
you
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear
,
no
!
"
say
Dorothea
,
beseechingly
,
crush
by
oppose
fear
.
<EOS>
"
but
may
I
wait
and
reflect
a
little
while
?
 
<EOS>
I
desire
with
my
whole
soul
to
do
what
will
comfort
you
;
but
I
can
not
give
any
pledge
suddenly
 
still
less
a
pledge
to
do
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
then
confide
in
the
nature
of
my
wish
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
grant
me
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
beseechingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
till
to
-
morrow
then
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
.
  
<EOS>
soon
she
could
hear
that
he
be
sleep
,
but
there
be
no
more
sleep
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
while
she
constrain
herself
to
lie
still
lest
she
should
disturb
him
,
her
mind
be
carry
on
a
conflict
in
which
imagination
range
its
force
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
presentiment
that
the
power
which
her
husband
wish
to
establish
over
her
future
action
have
relation
to
anything
else
than
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
clear
enough
to
her
that
he
would
expect
her
to
devote
herself
to
sift
those
mixed
heap
of
material
,
which
be
to
be
the
doubtful
illustration
of
principle
still
more
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
child
have
become
altogether
unbelieving
as
to
the
trustworthiness
of
that
Key
which
have
make
the
ambition
and
the
labor
of
her
husband
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
wonderful
that
,
in
spite
of
her
small
instruction
,
her
judgment
in
this
matter
be
true
than
his
:
for
she
look
with
unbiassed
comparison
and
healthy
sense
at
probability
on
which
he
have
risk
all
his
egoism
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
she
picture
to
herself
the
day
,
and
month
,
and
year
which
she
must
spend
in
sort
what
may
be
call
shattered
mummy
,
and
fragment
of
a
tradition
which
be
itself
a
mosaic
wrought
from
crushed
ruin
 
<EOS>
sort
them
as
food
for
a
theory
which
be
already
wither
in
the
birth
like
an
elfin
child
.
 
<EOS>
doubtless
a
vigorous
error
vigorously
pursue
have
keep
the
embryo
of
truth
a
-
breathing
:
the
quest
of
gold
being
at
the
same
time
a
questioning
of
substance
,
the
body
of
chemistry
be
prepare
for
its
soul
,
and
Lavoisier
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Casaubon
's
theory
of
the
element
which
make
the
seed
of
all
tradition
be
not
likely
to
bruise
itself
unawares
against
discovery
:
it
float
among
flexible
conjecture
no
more
solid
than
those
etymology
which
seem
strong
because
of
likeness
in
sound
until
it
be
show
that
likeness
in
sound
make
them
impossible
:
it
be
a
method
of
interpretation
which
be
not
test
by
the
necessity
of
form
anything
which
have
sharp
collision
than
an
elaborate
notion
of
Gog
and
Magog
<EOS>
:
it
be
as
free
from
interruption
as
a
plan
for
thread
the
star
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
Dorothea
have
so
often
have
to
check
her
weariness
and
impatience
over
this
questionable
riddle
-
guess
,
as
it
reveal
itself
to
her
instead
of
the
fellowship
in
high
knowledge
which
be
to
make
life
worthy
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
understand
well
enough
now
why
her
husband
have
come
to
cling
to
her
,
as
possibly
the
only
hope
leave
that
his
labor
would
ever
take
a
shape
in
which
they
could
be
give
to
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
it
have
seem
that
he
wish
to
keep
even
her
aloof
from
any
close
knowledge
of
what
he
be
do
;
but
gradually
the
terrible
stringency
of
human
need
 
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
a
too
speedy
death
    
<EOS>
and
here
Dorothea
's
pity
turn
from
her
own
future
to
her
husband
's
past
 
nay
,
to
his
present
hard
struggle
with
a
lot
which
have
grow
out
of
that
past
:
the
lonely
labor
,
the
ambition
breathe
hardly
under
the
pressure
of
self
-
distrust
;
the
goal
recede
,
and
the
heavy
limb
;
and
now
at
last
the
sword
visibly
tremble
above
him
!
 
<EOS>
and
have
she
not
wish
to
marry
him
that
she
may
help
him
in
his
life
's
labor
?
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
think
the
work
be
to
be
something
great
,
which
she
could
serve
in
devoutly
for
its
own
sake
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
right
,
even
to
soothe
his
grief
 
<EOS>
would
it
be
possible
,
even
if
she
promise
 
to
work
as
in
a
treadmill
fruitlessly
?
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
could
she
deny
him
?
 
<EOS>
Could
she
say
,
"
I
refuse
to
content
this
pining
hunger
?
"
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
refuse
to
do
for
him
dead
<EOS>
,
what
she
be
almost
sure
to
do
for
him
live
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
live
as
Lydgate
have
say
he
may
,
for
fifteen
year
or
more
,
her
life
would
certainly
be
spend
in
help
him
and
obey
him
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
a
deep
difference
between
that
devotion
to
the
living
and
that
indefinite
promise
of
devotion
to
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
live
,
he
could
claim
nothing
that
she
would
not
still
be
free
to
remonstrate
against
,
and
even
to
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
but
 
the
thought
pass
through
her
mind
more
than
once
,
though
she
could
not
believe
in
it
 
may
he
not
mean
to
demand
something
more
from
her
than
she
have
be
able
to
imagine
,
since
he
want
her
pledge
to
carry
out
his
wish
without
tell
her
exactly
what
they
be
?
 
<EOS>
no
;
his
heart
be
bind
up
in
his
work
only
<EOS>
:
that
be
the
end
for
which
his
fail
life
be
to
be
eke
out
by
hers
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
if
she
be
to
say
,
"
no
!
<EOS>
if
you
die
,
I
will
put
no
finger
to
your
work
"
 
<EOS>
it
seem
as
if
she
would
be
crush
that
bruise
heart
.
  
<EOS>
for
four
hour
Dorothea
lie
in
this
conflict
,
till
she
feel
ill
and
bewilder
,
unable
to
resolve
,
pray
mutely
.
 
<EOS>
Helpless
as
a
child
which
have
sob
and
seek
too
long
<EOS>
,
she
fall
into
a
late
morning
sleep
,
and
when
she
wake
Mr.
Casaubon
be
already
up
.
 
<EOS>
Tantripp
tell
her
that
he
have
read
prayer
,
breakfast
,
and
be
in
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
you
look
so
pale
,
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
Tantripp
,
a
solid
-
figured
woman
who
have
be
with
the
sister
at
Lausanne
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
ever
high
-
colored
,
Tantripp
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
smile
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
not
to
say
high
-
colored
,
but
with
a
bloom
like
a
Chiny
rise
.
<EOS>
but
always
smell
those
leather
book
,
what
can
be
expect
?
 
<EOS>
do
rest
a
little
this
morning
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
say
you
be
ill
and
not
able
to
go
into
that
close
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
let
me
make
haste
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Casaubon
want
me
particularly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
she
go
down
she
feel
sure
that
she
should
promise
to
fulfil
his
wish
;
but
that
would
be
later
in
the
day
 
not
yet
.
  
<EOS>
as
Dorothea
enter
the
library
,
Mr.
Casaubon
turn
round
from
the
table
where
he
have
be
place
some
book
,
and
say
    
"
I
be
wait
for
your
appearance
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hope
to
set
to
work
at
once
this
morning
,
but
I
find
myself
under
some
indisposition
,
probably
from
too
much
excitement
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
now
to
take
a
turn
in
the
shrubbery
,
since
the
air
be
milder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
that
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
mind
,
I
fear
,
be
too
active
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
fain
have
it
set
at
rest
on
the
point
I
last
speak
of
,
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
now
,
I
hope
,
give
me
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
out
to
you
in
the
garden
presently
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
win
a
little
breathing
space
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
in
the
Yew
-
tree
Walk
for
the
next
half
-
hour
,
"
say
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
then
he
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
,
feel
very
weary
,
rang
and
ask
Tantripp
to
bring
her
some
wrap
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
sit
still
for
a
few
minute
,
but
not
in
any
renewal
of
the
former
conflict
<EOS>
:
she
simply
feel
that
she
be
go
to
say
"
<EOS>
yes
"
to
her
own
doom
:
she
be
too
weak
,
too
full
of
dread
at
the
thought
of
inflict
a
keen
-
edge
blow
on
her
husband
,
to

submit
completely

<EOS>
She
sit
still
and
let
Tantripp
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
a
passivity
which
be
unusual
with
her
,
for
she
like
to
wait
on
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you

"
say
Tantripp
,
with
an
irrepressible
movement
of
love
towards
the
beautiful
,
gentle
creature
for
whom
she
feel
unable
to
do
anything
more
,
now
that
she
have
finish
tie
the
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
much
for
Dorothea
's
highly
-
strung
feeling
,
and
she
burst
into
tear
,
sob
against
Tantripp
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
but
soon
she
check
herself
,
dry
her
eye
,
and
go
out
at
the
glass
door
into
the
shrubbery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
every
book
in
that
library
be
build
into
a
caticom
for
your

Tantripp
to
Pratt
,
the
butler
,
find
him
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
at
Rome
,
and
visit
the
antiquity
,
as
we
know
;
and
she
always
decline
to
call
Mr.
Casaubon
anything
but
"
your
master

"
when
speak
to
the
other
servant

<EOS>
Pratt
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
his
master
very
well
,
but
he
like
Tantripp
better
.
  
<EOS>
when
Dorothea
be
out
on
the
gravel
<EOS>
walk
<EOS>
,
she
linger
among
the
nearer
clump
of
tree
,
hesitate
,
as
she
have
do
once
before
,
though
from
a
different
cause
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
have
fear
lest
her
effort
at
fellowship
should
be
unwelcome
;
now
she
dread
go
to
the
spot
where
she
foresee
that
she
must
bind
herself
to
a
fellowship
from
which
she
shrink
.
 
<EOS>
neither
law
nor
the
world
's
opinion
compel
her
to
this
 
only
her
husband
's
nature
and
her
own
compassion
,
only
the
ideal
and
not
the
real
yoke
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
clearly
enough
the
whole
situation
,
yet
she
be
fetter
<EOS>
:
she
could
not
smite
the
stricken
soul
that
entreat
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
weakness
,
Dorothea
be
weak
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
half
-
hour
be
pass
,
and
she
must
not
delay
longer
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
Yew
-
tree
walk
she
could
not
see
her
husband
;
but
the
walk
have
bend
,
and
she
go
,
expect
to
catch
sight
of
his
figure
wrap
in
a
blue
cloak
,
which
,
with
a
warm
velvet
cap
,
be
his
outer
garment
on
chill
day
for
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
occur
to
her
that
he
may
be
rest
in
the
summer
-
house
,
towards
which
the
path
diverge
a
little
.
<EOS>
turn
the
angle
,
she
could
see
him
seat
on
the
bench
,
close
to
a
stone
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
arm
be
rest
on
the
table
,
and
his
brow
be
bow
down
on
them
,
the
blue
cloak
be
drag
forward
and
screen
his
face
on
each
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
exhaust
himself
last
night
,
"
Dorothea
say
to
herself
,
think
at
first
that
he
be
asleep
,
and
that
the
summer
-
house
be
too
damp
a
place
to
rest
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
she
remember
that
of
late
she
have
see
him
take
that
attitude
when
she
be
read
to
him
,
as
if
he
find
it
easy
than
any
other
;
and
that
he
would
sometimes
speak
,
as
well
as
listen
,
with
his
face
down
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
into
the
summerhouse
and
say
,
"
I
be
come
,
Edward
;
I
be
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
,
and
she
think
that
he
must
be
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
repeat
,
"
I
be
ready
!
"
<EOS>
still
he
be
motionless
;
and
with
a
sudden
confused
fear
,
she
lean
down
to
him
,
take
off
his
velvet
cap
,
and
lean
her
cheek
close
to
his
head
,
cry
in
a
distressed
tone
    
<EOS>
"
wake

wake

<EOS>
listen
to
me

<EOS>
I

come
to

<EOS>
but
Dorothea
never
give
her
answer
.
  
<EOS>
later
in
the
day
,
Lydgate
be
seat
by
her
bedside
,
and
she
be
talk
deliriously
,
think
aloud
,
and
recall
what
have
go
through
her
mind
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
him
,
and
call
him
by
his
name
,
but
appear
to
think
it
right
that
she
should
explain
everything
to
him
;
and
again
,
and
again
,
beg
him
to
explain
everything
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
I
shall
go
to
him
soon

I
be

the
silence
in
her

ear
be
never
more
to
be
break

I

Sir

I
say
that
he
have
most
unfairly
compromise
Dorothea

I
say
that
there
never
be
a
mean
,
more
ungentlemanly
action
than
this
 
a
codicil
of
this
sort
to
a
will
which
he
make
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
with
the
knowledge
and
reliance
of
her

a
positive
insult
to
Dorothea
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
know
,
Casaubon
be
a
little
twisted
about
Ladislaw
.
<EOS>
Ladislaw
have
tell
me
the
reason
 
dislike
of
the
bent
he
take
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
do
not
think
much
of
Casaubon
's
notion
,
Thoth
and
Dagon
 
<EOS>
that
sort
of
thing
:
<EOS>
and
I
fancy
that
Casaubon
do
not
like
the
independent
position
Ladislaw
have
take
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
letter
between

,
you

<EOS>
Poor
Casaubon

a
little

well
for

to
put
that
color
on
it

Sir
James

<EOS>
"
but
I
believe
Casaubon
be
only
jealous
of
him
on
Dorothea

account
,

the
world
will
suppose
that
she
give
him
some
reason

that

her

that
Mr.

He
put
out

well

I
can
only

say
Mr.

,
<EOS>
well
please
that
he
have
win
the
argument

It
would
have

highly
inconvenient

him

Mr.

sincerely
believe

sit
by

with
an
expression

rather
provoke

too
sad

for
not

really
when

dull

troublesome

well

Sir

have
tell
Celia
everything

a
strong
representation
how
important
it
be

Dorothea
should
not

be

Mr.

have
be
right
in
predict
that

would
not
long
remain
passive

action
have

to

know
the

make
at

seem
clear

,
without

change
of
tone

throw
a
light
shawl
over

away

by

have
turn
cold
again

throw
herself
back

She
may
have
compare
her
experience
at
that
moment
to
the
vague
,
alarmed
consciousness
that
her
life
be
take
on
a
new
form
,
that
she
be
undergo
a
metamorphosis
in
which
memory
would
not
adjust
itself
to
the
stirring
of
new
organ
.
<EOS>
everything
be
change
its
aspect
:
her
husband
's
conduct
,
her
own
duteous
feeling
towards
him
,
every
struggle
between
them
 
and
yet
more
,
her
whole
relation
to
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
Her
world
be
in
a
state
of
convulsive
change
;
the
only
thing
she
could
say
distinctly
to
herself
be
,
that
she
must
wait
and
think
anew
.
 
<EOS>
one
change
terrify
her
as
if
it
have
be
a
sin
;
it
be
a
violent
shock
of
repulsion
from
her
departed
husband
,
who
have
have
hide
thought
,
perhaps
pervert
everything
she
say
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
then
again
she
be
conscious
of
another
change
which
also
make
her
tremulous
;
it
be
a
sudden
strange
yearning
of
heart
towards
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
never
before
enter
her
mind
that
he
could
,
under
any
circumstance
,
be
her
lover
:
<EOS>
conceive
the
effect
of
the
sudden
revelation
that
another
have
think
of
him
in
that
light
 
<EOS>
that
perhaps
he
himself
have
be
conscious
of
such
a
possibility
,
 
and
this
with
the
hurrying
,
crowd
vision
of
unfitting
condition
,
and
question
not
soon
to
be
solve
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
a
long
while
 
she
do
not
know
how
long
 
before
she
hear
Celia
say
,

that
will
do

can
go

what
I
think
,
Dodo

Celia
go
on

observe
nothing
more
than
that
Dorothea

lean
back

him
,
and
James
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
corner
of
his
mouth
be
dreadfully
spiteful
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
behave
in
this
way
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
religion
do
not
require
you
to
make
yourself
uncomfortable
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
take
away
,
that
be
a
mercy
,
and
you
ought
to
be
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
not
grieve
,
should
we
,
baby
?
"
say
Celia
confidentially
to
that
unconscious
centre
and
poise
of
the
world
,
who
have
the
most
remarkable
fist
all
complete
even
to
the
nail
,
and
hair
enough
,
really
,
when
you
take
his
cap
off
,
to
make
 
you
do
not
know
<EOS>
what
:
 
in
short
,
he
be
Bouddha
in
a
western
form
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
crisis
Lydgate
be
announce
,
and
one
of
the
first
thing
he
say
be
,
"
I
fear
you
be
not
so
well
as
you
be
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
;
have
you
be
agitate
?
<EOS>
allow
me
to
feel
your
pulse
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
hand
be
of
a
marble
coldness
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
want
to
go
to
Lowick
,
to
look
over
paper
,
"
say
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
ought
not
,
ought
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
speak
for
a
few
moment
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
look
at
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
Mrs.
Casaubon
should
do
what
would
give
her
the
most
repose
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
that
repose
will
not
always
come
from
be
forbid
to
act
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
exert
herself
,
"
I
be
sure
that
be
wise
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
thing
which
I
ought
to
attend
to
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
sit
here
idle
?
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
an
effort
to
recall
subject
not
connect
with
her
agitation
,
she
add
,
abruptly
,
"
You
know
every
one
in
Middlemarch
,
I
think
,
Mr.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
ask
you
to
tell
me
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
serious
thing
to
do
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
living
to
give
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Mr.
Tyke
and
all
the
 
"
but
Dorothea
's
effort
be
too
much
for
her
;
she
break
off
and
burst
into
sobs
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
make
her
drink
a
dose
of
sal
volatile
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
Mrs.
Casaubon
do
as
she
like
,
"
he
say
to
Sir
James
,
whom
he
ask
to
see
before
quit
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
want
perfect
freedom
,
I
think
,
more
than
any
other
prescription
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
attendance
on
Dorothea
while
her
brain
be
excited
,
have
enable
him
to
form
some
true
conclusion
concern
the
trial
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
that
she
have
be
suffer
from
the
strain
and
conflict
of
self
-
repression
;
and
that
she
be
likely
now
to
feel
herself
only
in
another
sort
of
pinfold
than
that
from
which
she
have
be
release
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
advice
be
all
the
easy
for
Sir
James
to
follow
when
he
find
that
Celia
have
already
tell
Dorothea
the
unpleasant
fact
about
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
help
for
it
now
 
no
reason
for
any
further
delay
in
the
execution
of
necessary
business
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
next
day
Sir
James
comply
at
once
with
her
request
that
he
would
drive
her
to
Lowick
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
wish
to
stay
there
at
present
,
"
say
Dorothea
;
<EOS>
"
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
happy
at
Freshitt
with
Celia
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
think
better
about
what
should
be
do
at
Lowick
by
look
at
it
from
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
should
like
to
be
at
the
Grange
a
little
while
with
my
uncle
,
and
go
about
in
all
the
old
walk
and
among
the
people
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
yet
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Your
uncle
be
have
political
company
,
and
you
be
well
out
of
the
way
of
such
doing
,
"
say
Sir
James
,
who
at
that
moment
thought
of
the
Grange
chiefly
as
a
haunt
of
young
Ladislaw
's
.
<EOS>
but
no
word
pass
between
him
and
Dorothea
about
the
objectionable
part
of
the
will
;
indeed
,
both
of
them
feel
that
the
mention
of
it
between
them
would
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
be
shy
,
even
with
man
,
about
disagreeable
subject
;
and
the
one
thing
that
Dorothea
would
have
choose
to
say
,
if
she
have
speak
on
the
matter
at
all
,
be
forbid
to
her
at
present
because
it
seem
to
be
a
further
exposure
of
her
husband
's
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
do
wish
that
Sir
James
could
know
what
have
pass
between
her
and
her
husband
about
Will
Ladislaw
's
moral
claim
on
the
property
:
it
would
then
,
she
think
,
be
apparent
to
him
as
it
be
to
her
,
that
her
husband
's
strange
indelicate
proviso
have
be
chiefly
urge
by
his
bitter
resistance
to
that
idea
of
claim
,
and
not
merely
by
personal
feeling
more
difficult
to
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
it
must
be
admit
,
Dorothea
wish
that
this
could
be
know
for
Will
's
sake
,
since
her
friend
seem
to
think
of
him
as
simply
an
object
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
charity
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
compare
with
an
italian
carry
white
mouse
?
 
<EOS>
that
word
quote
from
Mrs.
Cadwallader
seem
like
a
mock
travesty
wrought
in
the
dark
by
an
impish
finger
.
  
<EOS>
at
Lowick
Dorothea
search
desk
and
drawer
 
search
all
her
husband
's
place
of
deposit
for
private
writing
,
but
find
no
paper
address
especially
to
her
,
except
that
"
Synoptical
Tabulation
,
"
which
be
probably
only
the
beginning
of
many
intend
direction
for
her
guidance
.
 
<EOS>
in
carry
out
this
bequest
of
labor
to
Dorothea
,
as
in
all
else
,
Mr.
Casaubon
have
be
slow
and
hesitating
,
oppress
in
the
plan
of
transmit
his
work
,
as
he
have
be
in
execute
it
,
by
the
sense
of
move
heavily
in
a
dim
and
clogging
medium
:
<EOS>
distrust
of
Dorothea
's
competence
to
arrange
what
he
have
prepare
be
subdue
only
by
distrust
of
any
other
redactor
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
come
at
last
to
create
a
trust
for
himself
out
of
Dorothea
's
nature
:
she
could
do
what
she
resolve
to
do
:
and
he
willingly
imagine
her
toiling
under
the
fetter
of
a
promise
to
erect
a
tomb
with
his
name
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
(
not
that
Mr.
Casaubon
call
the
future
volume
a
tomb
;
he
call
them
the
key
to
all
Mythologies
.
)
<EOS>
but
the
month
gain
on
him
and
leave
his
plan
belate
:
he
have
only
have
time
to
ask
for
that
promise
by
which
he
seek
to
keep
his
cold
grasp
on
Dorothea
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
grasp
have
slip
away
.
 
<EOS>
bind
by
a
pledge
give
from
the
depth
of
her
pity
,
she
would
have
be
capable
of
undertake
a
toil
which
her
judgment
whisper
<EOS>
be
vain
for
all
use
except
that
consecration
of
faithfulness
which
be
a
supreme
use
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
her
judgment
,
instead
of
be
control
by
duteous
devotion
,
be
make
active
by
the
imbittere
discovery
that
in
her
past
union
there
have
lurk
the
hidden
alienation
of
secrecy
and
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
the
living
,
suffer
man
be
no
longer
before
her
to
awaken
her
pity
:
there
remain
only
the
retrospect
of
painful
subjection
to
a
husband
whose
thought
have
be
low
than
she
have
believe
,
whose
exorbitant
claim
for
himself
have
even
blind
his
scrupulous
care
for
his
own
character
,
and
make
him
defeat
his
own
pride
by
shock
man
of
ordinary
honor
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
property
which
be
the
sign
of
that
break
tie
,
she
would
have
be
glad
to
be
free
from
it
and
have
nothing
more
than
her
original
fortune
which
have
be
settle
on
her
,
if
there
have
not
be
duty
attach
to
ownership
,
which
she
ought
not
to
flinch
from
.
 
<EOS>
about
this
property
<EOS>
many
troublous
question
insist
on
rise
:
have
she
not
be
right
in
think
that
the
half
of
it
ought
to
go
to
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
?
 
<EOS>
but
be
it
not
impossible
now
for
her
to
do
that
act
of
justice
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
have
take
a
cruelly
effective
mean
of
hinder
her
:
even
with
indignation
against
him
in
her
heart
,
any
act
that
seem
a
triumphant
eluding
of
his
purpose
revolt
her
.
  
<EOS>
after
collect
paper
of
business
which
she
wish
to
examine
,
she
lock
up
again
the
desk
and
drawer
 
all
empty
of
personal
word
for
her
 
empty
of
any
sign
that
in
her
husband
's
lonely
brood
his
heart
have
go
out
to
her
in
excuse
or
explanation
;
and
she
go
back
to
Freshitt
with
the
sense
that
around
his
last
hard
demand
and
his
last
injurious
assertion
of
his
power
,
the
silence
be
unbroken
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
try
now
to
turn
her
thought
towards
immediate
duty
,
and
one
of
these
be
of
a
kind
which
other
be
determine
to
remind
her
of
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
ear
have
catch
eagerly
her
mention
of
the
living
,
and
as
soon
as
he
could
,
he
reopen
the
subject
,
see
here
a
possibility
of
make
amend
for
the
casting
-
vote
he
have
once
give
with
an
ill
-
satisfied
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
"
instead
of
tell
you
anything
about
Mr.
Tyke
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
should
like
to
speak
of
another
man
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
,
the
Vicar
of
St.
Botolph
's
.
 
<EOS>
His
living
be
a
poor
one
,
and
give
him
a
stint
provision
for
himself
and
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
,
aunt
,
and
sister
all
live
with
him
,
and
depend
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
have
never
marry
because
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
such
good
preaching
as
his
 
such
plain
,
easy
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
do
to
preach
at
St.
Paul
's
Cross
after
old
Latimer
.
 
<EOS>
His
talk
be
just
as
good
about
all
subject
:
original
,
simple
,
clear
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
him
a
remarkable
fellow
:
he
ought
to
have
do
more
than
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
have
he
not
do
more
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
interested
now
in
all
who
have
slip
below
their
own
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
hard
question
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
myself
that
it
be
uncommonly
difficult
to
make
the
right
thing
work
:
there
be
so
many
string
pull
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Farebrother
often
hint
that
he
have
get
into
the
wrong
profession
;
he
want
a
wide
range
than
that
of
a
poor
clergyman
,
and
I
suppose
he
have
no
interest
to
help
him
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
fond
of
natural
history
and
various
scientific
matter
,
and
he
be
hamper
in
reconcile
these
taste
with
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
money
to
spare
 
hardly
enough
to
use
;
and
that
have
lead
him
into
card
-
playing
 
Middlemarch
<EOS>
be
a
great
place
for
whist
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
play
for
money
,
and
he
win
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
that
take
him
into
company
a
little
beneath
him
,
and
make
him
slack
about
some
thing
;
and
yet
,
with
all
that
,
look
at
him
as
a
whole
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
be
one
of
the
most
blameless
man
I
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
neither
venom
nor
doubleness
in
him
,
and
those
often
go
with
a
more
correct
outside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
suffer
in
his
conscience
because
of
that
habit
,
"
say
Dorothea
;
"
I
wonder
whether
he
wish
he
could
leave
it
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
he
would
leave
it
off
,
if
he
be
transplant
into
plenty
:
he
would
be
glad
of
the
time
for
other
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
say
that
Mr.
Tyke
be
speak
of
as
an
apostolic
man
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
meditatively
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
wish
it
be
possible
to
restore
the
time
of
primitive
zeal
,
and
yet
think
of
Mr.
Farebrother
with
a
strong
desire
to
rescue
him
from
his
chance
-
get
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
Farebrother
be
apostolic
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
position
be
not
quite
like
that
of
the
apostle
:
he
be
only
a
parson
among
parishioner
whose
life
he
have
to
try
and
make
better
.
<EOS>
practically
I
find
that
what
be
call
be
apostolic
now
,
be
an
impatience
of
everything
in
which
the
parson
do
not
cut
the
principal
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
something
of
that
in
Mr.
Tyke
at
the
hospital
:
a
good
deal
of
his
doctrine
be
a
sort
of
pinch
hard
to
make
people
uncomfortably
aware
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
an
apostolic
man
at
Lowick
!
 
<EOS>
he
ought
to
think
,
as
St.
Francis
do
,
that
it
be
needful
to
preach
to
the
bird
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
to
imagine
what
sort
of
notion
our
farmer
and
laborer
get
from
their
teaching
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
look
into
a
volume
of
sermon
by
Mr.
Tyke
:
such
sermon
would
be
of
no
use
at
Lowick
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
about
imputed
righteousness
and
the
prophecy
in
the
Apocalypse
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
be
think
of
the
different
way
in
which
Christianity
be
teach
,
and
<EOS>
whenever
I
find
one
way
that
make
it
a
wide
blessing
than
any
other
,
I
cling
to
that
as
the
true
 
<EOS>
I
mean
that
which
take
in
the
most
good
of
all
kind
,
and
bring
in
the
most
people
as
sharer
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
surely
well
to
pardon
too
much
,
than
to
condemn
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
to
see
Mr.
Farebrother
and
hear
him
preach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
,
"
say
lydgate
;
<EOS>
"
I
trust
to
the
effect
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
beloved
,
but
he
have
his
enemy
too
:
there
be
always
people
who
can
not
forgive
an
able

for

from
them

<EOS>
and
that
money

win
business
be
really
a
blot
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
,
of
course
,
see
many
Middlemarch
people
:
but
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
who
be
constantly
see
Mr.
Brooke
,
be
a
great
friend
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
old
lady
,
and
would
be
glad
to
sing
the
Vicar
's
praise
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
old
lady
 
Miss
Noble
,
the
aunt
 
be
a
wonderfully
quaint
picture
of
self
-
forgetful
goodness
,
and
Ladislaw
gallant
her
about
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
them
one
day
in
a
back
street
:
<EOS>
you
know
Ladislaw
's
look
 
a
sort
of
Daphnis
in
coat
and
waistcoat
;
and
this
little
old
maid
reach
up
to
his
arm
 
<EOS>
they
look
like
a
couple
drop
out
of
a
romantic
comedy
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
good
evidence
about
Farebrother
be
to
see
him
and
hear
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Happily
Dorothea
be
in
her
private
sitting
-
room
when
this
conversation
occur
,
and
there
be
no
one
present
to
make
Lydgate
's
innocent
introduction
of
Ladislaw
painful
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
be
usual
with
him
in
matter
of
personal
gossip
,
Lydgate
have
quite
forget
Rosamond
's
remark
that
she
think
Will
adore
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
be
only
care
for
what
would
recommend
the
Farebrother
family
;
and
he
have
purposely
give
emphasis
to
the
bad
that
could
be
say
about
the
Vicar
,
in
order
to
forestall
objection
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
week
since
Mr.
Casaubon
's
death
he
have
hardly
see
Ladislaw
,
and
he
have
hear
no
rumor
to
warn
him
that
Mr.
Brooke
's
confidential
secretary
be
a
dangerous
subject
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
his
picture
of
Ladislaw
linger
in
her
mind
and
dispute
the
ground
with
that
question
of
the
Lowick
living
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
Will
Ladislaw
think
about
her
?
 
<EOS>
Would
he
hear
of
that
fact
which
make
her
cheek
burn
as
they
never
use
to
do
?
<EOS>
and
how
would
he
feel
when
he
hear
it
?
 
<EOS>
but
she
could
see
as
well
as
possible
how
he
smile
down
at
the
little
old
maid
.
 
<EOS>
an
Italian
with
white
mouse
!
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
a
creature
who
enter
into
every
one
's
feeling
,
and
could
take
the
pressure
of
their
thought
instead
of
urge
his
own
with
iron
resistance
.
        
<EOS>
Party
be
Nature
too
,
and
you
shall
see
    
by
force
of
logic
how
they
both
agree
:
    
the
many
in
the
one
,
the
one
in
Many
;
    
all
be
not
some
,
nor
some
the
same
as
any

<EOS>
Genus
hold
specie
,
both
be
great
or
small
;
    
one
genus
high
,
one
not
high
at
all
;
    
<EOS>
each
specie
have
its
differentia
too
,
    
<EOS>
this
be
not
that
,
and
He
be
never
You
,
    
<EOS>
though
this
and
that
be
ayes
,
and
you
and
he
    
be
like
as
one

one
,
or
three
to
three
.
  
<EOS>
no
gossip
about
Mr.
Casaubon
's
will
have
yet
reach
Ladislaw
:
the
air
seem
to
be
fill
with
the
dissolution
of
Parliament
and
the
come
election
,
as
the
old
wake
and
fair
be
fill
with
the
rival
clatter
of
itinerant
show
;
and
more
private
noise
be
take
little
notice
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
famous
"
dry
election
"
be
at
hand
,
in
which
the
depth
of
public
feeling
may
be
measure
by
the
low
flood
-
mark
of
drink
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
be
one
of
the
busy
at
this
time
;
and
though
Dorothea
's
widowhood
be
continually
in
his
thought
,
he
be
so
far
from
wish
to
be
speak
to
on
the
subject
,
that
when
Lydgate
seek
him
out
to
tell
him
what
have
pass
about
the
Lowick
living
,
he
answer
rather
waspishly
    
"
why
should
you
bring
me
into
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
be
not
likely
to
see
her
,
since
she
be
at
Freshitt
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Tory
ground
,
where
I
and
the
"
Pioneer
"
be
no
more
welcome
than
a
poacher
and
his
gun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
Will
have
be
make
the
more
susceptible
by
observe
that
Mr.
Brooke
,
instead
of
wish
him
,
as
before
,
to
come
to
the
grange
oftener
than
be
quite
agreeable
to
himself
,
seem
now
to
contrive
that
he
should
go
there
as
little
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
shuffling
concession
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
to
Sir
James
Chettam
's
indignant
remonstrance
;
and
Will
,
awake
to
the
slight
hint
in
this
direction
,
conclude
that
he
be
to
be
keep
away
from
the
Grange
on
Dorothea
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
Her
friend
,
then
,
regard
him
with
some
suspicion
?
 
<EOS>
Their
fear
be
quite
superfluous
:
they
be
very
much
mistake
if
they
imagine
that
he
would
put
himself
forward
as
a
needy
adventurer
try
to
win
the
favor
of
a
rich
woman
.
  
<EOS>
until
now
Will
have
never
fully
see
the
chasm
between
himself
and
Dorothea
 
until
now
that
he
be
come
to
the
brink
of
it
,
and
see
her
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
,
not
without
some
inward
rage
,
to
think
of
go
away
from
the
neighborhood
:
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
show
any
further
interest
in
Dorothea
without
subject
himself
to
disagreeable
imputation
 
perhaps
even
in
her
mind
,
which
other
may
try
to
poison
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
forever
divide
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
as
well
be
at
Rome
;
she
would
be
no
farther
from
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
what
we
call
our
despair
be
often
only
the
painful
eagerness
of
unfed
hope
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
reason
why
he
should
not
go
 
public
reason
why
he
should
not
quit
his
post
at
this
crisis
,
leave
Mr.
Brooke
in
the
lurch
when
he
need
"
coach
"
for
the
election
,
and
when
there
be
so
much
canvass
,
direct
and
indirect
,
to
be
carry
on
.
 
<EOS>
Will
could
not
like
to
leave
his
own
chessman
in
the
heat
of
a
game
;
and
any
candidate
on
the
right
side
,
even
if
his
brain
and
marrow
have
be
as
soft
as
be
consistent
with
a
gentlemanly
bearing
,
may
help
to
turn
a
majority
.
 
<EOS>
to
coach
Mr.
Brooke
and
keep
him
steadily
to
the
idea
that
he
must
pledge
himself
to
vote
for
the
actual
Reform
Bill
,
instead
of
insist
on
his
independence
and
power
of
pull
up
in
time
,
be
not
an
easy
task
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
's
prophecy
of
a
fourth
candidate
"
in
the
bag
"
have
not
yet
be
fulfil
,
neither
the
Parliamentary
Candidate
Society
nor
any
other
power
on
the
watch
to
secure
a
reform
majority
see
a
worthy
nodus
for
interference
while
there
be
a
second
reform
candidate
like
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
may
be
return
at
his
own
expense
;
and
the
fight
lie
entirely
between
Pinkerton
the
old
Tory
member
,
bagster
the
new
Whig
member
return
at
the
last
election
,
and
Brooke
the
future
independent
member
,
who
be
to
fetter
himself
for
this
occasion
only
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hawley
and
his
party
would
bend
all
their
force
to
the
return
of
Pinkerton
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
's
success
must
depend
either
on
plumper
which
would
leave
Bagster
in
the
rear
,
or
on
the
new
minting
of
Tory
vote
into
reform
vote
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
mean
,
of
course
,
would
be
preferable
.
  
<EOS>
this
prospect
of
convert
vote
be
a
dangerous
distraction
to
Mr.
Brooke
:
his
impression
that
waverer
be
likely
to
be
allure
by
wavering
statement
,
and
also
the
liability
of
his
mind
to
stick
afresh
at
oppose
argument
as
they
turn
up
in
his
memory
,
give
Will
ladislaw
much
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
there
be
tactic
in
these
thing
,
"
say
Mr.
Brooke
;
"
meet
people
half
-
way
 
temper
your
idea
 
say
,
"
well
now
,
there
be
something
in
that

"
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
agree
with
you
that
this
be
a
peculiar
occasion
 
<EOS>
the
country
with
a
will
of
its
own
 
political
union
 
<EOS>
that
sort
of
thing
 
<EOS>
but
we
sometimes
cut
with
rather
too
sharp
a
knife
,
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
these
ten

pound
householder
,
now
<EOS>
:
why
ten
?
 
<EOS>
draw
the
line
somewhere
 
<EOS>
yes
:
<EOS>
but
why
just
at
ten
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
difficult
question
,
now
,
if
you
go
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
,
"
say
Will
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
be
to
wait
till
we
get
a
logical
Bill
,
you
must
put
yourself
forward
as
a
revolutionist
,
and
then
Middlemarch
would
not
elect
you
,
I
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
trim
,
this
be
not
a
time
for
trim
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
always
end
by
agree
with
Ladislaw
,
who
still
appear
to
him
a
sort
of
Burke
with
a
leaven
of
Shelley
;
but
after
an
interval
the
wisdom
of
his
own
method
reassert
itself
,
and
he
be
again
draw
into
use
them
with
much
hopefulness
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
stage
of
affair
he
be
in
excellent
spirit
,
which
even
support
him
under
large
advance
of
money
;
for
his
power
of
convincing
and
persuading
have
not
yet
be
test
by
anything
more
difficult
than
a
chairman
's
speech
introduce
other
orator
,
or
a
dialogue
with
a
Middlemarch
voter
,
from
which
he
come
away
with
a
sense
that
he
be
a
tactician
by
nature
,
and
that
it
be
a
pity
he
have
not
go
earlier
into
this
kind
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
conscious
of
defeat
,
however
,
with
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
a
chief
representative
in
Middlemarch
of
that
great
social
power
,
the
retail
trader
,
and
naturally
one
of
the
most
doubtful
voter
in
the
borough
 
willing
for
his
own
part
to
supply
an
equal
quality
of
tea
and
sugar
to
reformer
and
anti
-
reformer
,
as
well
as
to
agree
impartially
with
both
,
and
feel
like
the
burgess
of
old
that
this
necessity
of
elect
member
be
a
great
burthen
to
a
town
;
for
even
if
there
be
no
danger
in
hold
out
hope
to
all
party
beforehand
,
there
would
be
the
painful
necessity
at
last
of
disappointing
respectable
people
whose
name
be
on
his
book

<EOS>
He
be
accustomed
to
receive
large
order
from
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
;
but
then
,
there
be
many
of
Pinkerton
's
committee
whose
opinion
have
a
great
weight
of
grocery
on
their
side

<EOS>
Mr.
Mawmsey
think
that
Mr.

,
as
not
too
"
clever
in
his
intellect
,
"
be
the
more
likely
to
forgive
a
grocer
who
give
a
hostile
vote
under
pressure
,
have
become
confidential
in
his
back
parlor

<EOS>
"
as

few
man
have
less
need
to
cry
for
change
than
I
have
,
personally
speak
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
for
self
and
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
one
of
those
who
have
nothing
to
lose
:
I
mean
as
to
respectability
both
in
parish
and
private
business

and
noways
in
respect
of
your
honorable
self
and
custom
,
which
you
be
good
enough
to
say
you
would
not
withdraw
from
me
,
vote
or
no
vote
,
while
the
article
send
in
be
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
conversation
Mr.
Mawmsey
go
up
and
boast
to
his
wife
that
he
have
be
rather
too
many
for
Brooke
of
Tipton
,
and
that
he
do
not
mind
so
much
now
about
go
to
the
poll
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
on
this
occasion
abstain
from
boasting
of
his
tactic
to
Ladislaw
,
who
for
his
part
be
glad
enough
to
persuade
himself
that
he
have
no
concern
with
any
canvass
except
the
purely
argumentative
sort
,
and
that
he
work
no
mean
engine
than
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
,
necessarily
,
have
his
agent
,
who
understand
the
nature
of
the
Middlemarch
voter
and
the
mean
of
enlist
his
ignorance
on
the
side
of
the
Bill
 
which
be
remarkably
similar
to
the
mean
of
enlist
it
on
the
side
against
the
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
Will
stop
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
Parliament
,
like
the
rest
of
our
life
,
even
to
our
eating
and
apparel
,
could
hardly
go
on
if
our
imagination
be
too
active
about
process
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
dirty
-
handed
man
in
the
world
to
do
dirty
business
;
and
Will
protest
to
himself
that
his
share
in
bring
Mr.
Brooke
through
would
be
quite
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
but
whether
he
should
succeed
in
that
mode
of
contribute
to
the
majority
on
the
right
side
be
very
doubtful
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
write
out
various
speech
and
memorandum
for
speech
,
but
he
have
begin
to
perceive
that
Mr.
Brooke
's
mind
,
if
it
have
the
burthen
of
remember
any
train
of
thought
,
would
let
it
drop
,
run
away
in
search
of
it
,
and
not
easily
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
to
collect
document
be
one
mode
of
serve
your
country
,
and
to
remember
the
content
of
a
document
be
another
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
the
only
way
in
which
Mr.
Brooke
could
be
coerce
into
thinking
of
the
right
argument
at
the
right
time
be
to
be
well
plied
with
them
till
they
take
up
all
the
room
in
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
there
be
the
difficulty
of
find
room
,
so
many
thing
have
be
take
in
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
himself
observe
that
his
idea
stand
rather
in
his
way
when
he
be
speak
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Ladislaw
's
coaching
be
forthwith
to
be
put
to
the
test
,
for
before
the
day
of
nomination
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
be
to
explain
himself
to
the
worthy
elector
of
Middlemarch
from
the
balcony
of
the
White
Hart
,
which
look
out
advantageously
at
an
angle
of
the
market
-
place
,
command
a
large
area
in
front
and
two
converging
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
May
morning
,
and
everything
seem
hopeful
:
there
be
some
prospect
of
an
understanding
between
Bagster
's
committee
and
Brooke
's
,
to
which
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
Mr.
Standish
as
a
liberal
lawyer
,
and
such
manufacturer
as
Mr.
Plymdale
and
Mr.
Vincy
,
give
a
solidity
which
almost
counterbalance
Mr.
Hawley
and
his
associate
who
sit
for
Pinkerton
at
the
Green
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
,
conscious
of
have
weaken
the
blast
of
the
"
Trumpet
"
against
him
,
by
his
reform
as
a
landlord
in
the
last
half
year
,
and
hear
himself
cheer
a
little
as
he
drive
into
the
town
,
feel
his
heart
tolerably
light
under
his
buff
-
color
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
regard
to
critical
occasion
,
it
often
happen
that
all
moment
seem
comfortably
remote
until
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
look
well
,
eh
?
"
say
Mr.
Brooke
as
the
crowd
gather
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
a
good
audience
,
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
this
,
<EOS>
now
 
this
kind
of
public
make
up
of
one
's
own
neighbor
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
weaver
and
tanner
of
Middlemarch
,
unlike
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
have
never
think
of
Mr.
Brooke
as
a
neighbor
,
and
be
not
more
attached
to
him
than
if
he
have
be
send
in
a
box
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
listen
without
much
disturbance
to
the
speaker
who
introduce
the
candidate
,
one
of
them
 
a
political
personage
from
Brassing
,
who
come
to
tell
Middlemarch
its
duty
 
speak
<EOS>
so
fully
,
that
it
be
alarming
to
think
what
the
candidate
could
find
to
say
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
crowd
become
denser
,
and
as
the
political
personage
near
the
end
of
his
speech
,
Mr.
Brooke
feel
a
remarkable
change
in
his
sensation
while
he
still
handle
his
eye
-
glass
,
trifle
with
document
before
him
,
and
exchange
remark
with
his
committee
,
as
a
man
to
whom
the
moment
of
summon
be
indifferent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
another
glass
of
sherry
,
Ladislaw
,
"
he
say
,
with
an
easy
air
,
to
Will
,
who
be
close
behind
him
,
and
presently
hand
him
the
suppose
fortifier
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
ill
-
choose
;
for
Mr.
Brooke
be
an
abstemious
man
,
and
to
drink
a
second
glass
of
sherry
quickly
at
no
great
interval
from
the
first
be
a
surprise
to
his
system
which
tend
to
scatter
his
energy
instead
of
collect
them
.
 
<EOS>
pray
pity
him
:
so
many
english
gentleman
make
themselves
miserable
by
speechify
on
entirely
private
ground
!
 
<EOS>
whereas
Mr.
Brooke
wish
to
serve
his
country
by
stand
for
Parliament
 
which
,
indeed
,
may
also
be
do
on
private
ground
,
but
be
once
undertaken
do
absolutely
demand
some
speechifying
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
about
the
beginning
of
his
speech
that
Mr.
Brooke
be
at
all
anxious
;
this
,
he
feel
sure
,
would
be
all
right
;
he
should
have
it
quite
pat
,
cut
out
as
neatly
as
a
set
of
couplet
from
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
Embarking
would
be
easy
,
but
the
vision
of
open
sea
that
may
come
after
be
alarming
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
question
,
now
,
"
hint
the
demon
just
wake
up
in
his
stomach
,
"
somebody
may
put
question
about
the
schedule
.
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
,
"
he
continue
,
aloud
,
"
just
hand
me
the
memorandum
of
the
schedule
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Brooke
present
himself
on
the
balcony
,
the
cheer
be
quite
loud
enough
to
counterbalance
the
yell
,
groans
,
braying
,
and
other
expression
of
adverse
theory
,
which
be
so
moderate
that
Mr.
Standish
(
decidedly
an
old
bird
)
observe
in
the
ear
next
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
this
look
dangerous
,
by
God
!
 
<EOS>
Hawley
have
get
some
deep
plan
than
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
still
,
the
cheer
be
exhilarate
,
and
no
candidate
could
look
more
amiable
than
Mr.
Brooke
,
with
the
memorandum
in
his
breast
-
pocket
,
his
left
hand
on
the
rail
of
the
balcony
,
and
his
right
trifling
with
his
eye
-
glass
.
<EOS>
the
striking
point
in
his
appearance
be
his
buff
waistcoat
,
short
-
clip
blond
hair
,
and
neutral
physiognomy
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
with
some
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
gentleman
 
elector
of
Middlemarch
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
much
the
right
thing
that
a
little
pause
after
it
seem
natural
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
uncommonly
glad
to
be
here
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
so
proud
and
happy
in
my
life
 
never
so
happy
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
bold
figure
of
speech
,
but
not
exactly
the
right
thing
;
for
,
unhappily
,
the
pat
opening
have
slip
away
 
<EOS>
even
couplet
from
Pope
may
be
but
"
falling
from
us
,
vanishing
,
"
when
fear
clutch
us
,
and
a
glass
of
sherry
be
hurry
like
smoke
among
our
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
,
who
stand
at
the
window
behind
the
speaker
,
think
,
"
it
be
all
up
now

<EOS>
the
only
chance
be
that
,
since
the
good
thing
will
not
always
do
,
flounder
may
answer
for
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
,
meanwhile
,
have
lose
other
clew
,
fall
back
on
himself
and
his
qualification
 
always
an
appropriate
graceful
subject
for
a
candidate
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
plying
among
his
recollection
in
this
way

Mr.

may
have
get
along
,
easily
to
himself
,
and
would
have
come
back
from
the
remote
sea
without
trouble
;
but
a
diabolical
procedure
have
be
set
up
by
the
enemy

<EOS>
at
one
and
the
same
moment
there
have
rise
above
the
shoulder
of
the
crowd
,
nearly
opposite
Mr.

,
and
within
ten
yard
of
him
,
the
effigy
of
himself
:
buff
-
color
waistcoat
,
eye
-
glass
,
and
neutral
physiognomy
,
paint
on
rag
;
and
there
have
arise
,
apparently
in
the
air
,
like
the
note
of
the
cuckoo
,
a
parrot
-
like
,
Punch
-
voiced
echo
of
his
word

<EOS>
everybody
look
up
at
the
open
window
in
the
house
at
the
opposite
angle
of
the
converging
street
;
but
they
be
either
blank
,
or
fill
by
laugh
listener
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
innocent
echo
have
an
impish
mockery
in
it
when
it
follow
a
gravely
persistent
speaker
,
and
this
echo
be
not
at
all
innocent
;
if
it
do
not
follow
with
the
precision
of
a
natural
echo

it
have
a
wicked
choice

by
the
time
it

the

which
have
be
run
through

become
a

for
the
sober
effect

great

the
entanglement

have
identify

laugh
may
have
catch
his

Mr.

ask

reprehensively
,
what
the

be
do

a
voice
could
not
well

an
attack
on

have
be

equivocal

probably

Mr.

himself
be
not
in
a
position
to
be
quickly
conscious
of
anything
except
a
general
slip
away
of
idea
within
himself

he
have
even
a
little
singing
in
the
ear
,
and
he
be
the

Mr.

hear
the

he
have
expect
some
Tory
effort
at
disturbance

he
be
at
this
moment
additionally
excited
by
the
tickle

sting
sense

Mr.

pause
a

come
a
hail
of
egg

chiefly
aim
at
the
image

but
occasionally
hit
the
original
,
as
if
by
chance

<EOS>
there
be
a
stream
of
new
man
push
among
the
crowd
;
whistles
,
yell
,
bellowing
,
and
fife
make
all
the
great
hubbub
because
there
be
shout
and
struggle
to
put
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
no
voice
would
have
have
wing
enough
to
rise
above
the
uproar
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
,
disagreeably
anoint
,
stand
his
ground
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
the
frustration
would
have
be
less
exasperating
if
it
have
be
less
gamesome
and
boyish
:
a
serious
assault
of
which
the
newspaper
reporter
"
can
aver
that
it
endanger
the
learn
gentleman

or
can
respectfully
bear
witness

perhaps
more
consolation
attach
to
it

<EOS>
Mr.

re
-
enter
the
committee

room
,
say
,
as
carelessly
as
he
could
,
"
this
be
a
little
too
bad
,
you
know

<EOS>
I
should
have
get
the
ear
of
the
people
by
-
and
-
by
 
<EOS>
but
they
do
not
give
me
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
go
into
the

by

and

by

"
he
add
,
glance
at
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
"
however
,
thing
will
come
all
right
at
the
nomination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
resolve
unanimously
that
thing
would
come
right
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
committee
look
rather
grim
,
and
the
political
personage
from
Brassing
be
write
busily
,
as
if
he
be
brew
new
device
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Bowyer
who
do
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Standish
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
as
well
as
if

He

good

have
be
have
him
to
dinner
lately

there

in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
know
,
you
never

him
to

Standish
,
else
I
would
have
invite
him
to
dine
,
"
say
poor
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
have
go
through
a
great
deal
of
inviting
for
the
good
of
his
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
a
more
paltry
fellow
in
Middlemarch
than
Bowyer
,
"
say
Ladislaw
,
indignantly
,
"
but
it
seem
as
if
the
paltry
fellow
be
always
to
turn
the
scale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
will
be
thoroughly
out
of
temper
with
himself
as
well
as
with
his
"
principal
,
"
and
he
go
to
shut
himself
in
his
room
with
a
half
-
form
resolve
to
throw
up
the
"
Pioneer
"
and
Mr.
Brooke
together
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
stay
?
 
<EOS>
if
the
impassable
gulf
between
himself
and
Dorothea
be
ever
to
be
fill
up
,
it
must
rather
be
by
his
go
away
and
get
into
a
thoroughly
different
position
than
by
stay
here
and
slip
into
deserved
contempt
as
an
understrapper
of
Brooke
's
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
young
dream
of
wonder
that
he
may
do
 
in
five
year
,
for
example
:
political
writing
,
political
speaking
,
would
get
a
high
value
now
public
life
be
go
to
be
wide
and
more
national
,
and
they
may
give
him
such
distinction
that
he
would
not
seem
to
be
ask
Dorothea
to
step
down
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
five
year
:
 
if
he
could
only
be
sure
that
she
care
for
him
more
than
for
other
;
if
he
could
only
make
her
aware
that
he
stand
aloof
until
he
could
tell
his
love
without
lower
himself
 
<EOS>
then
he
could
go
away
easily
,
and
begin
a
career
which
at
five
-
and
-
twenty
seem
probable
enough
in
the
inward
order
of
thing
,
where
talent
bring
fame
,
and
fame
everything
else
which
be
delightful
.
<EOS>
He
could
speak
and
he
could
write
;
he
could
master
any
subject
if
he
choose
,
and
he
mean
always
to
take
the
side
of
reason
and
justice
,
on
which
he
would
carry
all
his
ardor
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
not
one
day
be
lift
above
the
shoulder
of
the
crowd
,
and
feel
that
he
have
win
that
eminence
well
?
 
<EOS>
without
doubt
he
would
leave
Middlemarch
,
go
to
town
,
and
make
himself
fit
for
celebrity
by
"
eat
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
not
immediately
:
not
until
some
kind
of
sign
have
pass
between
him
and
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
satisfied
until
she
know
why
,
even
if
he
be
the
man
she
would
choose
to
marry
,
he
would
not
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
must
keep
his
post
and
bear
with
Mr.
Brooke
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
soon
have
reason
to
suspect
that
Mr.
Brooke
have
anticipate
him
in
the
wish
to
break
up
their
connection
.
 
<EOS>
deputation
without
and
voice
within
have
concur
in
induce
that
philanthropist
to
take
a
strong
measure
than
usual
for
the
good
of
mankind
;
namely
,
to
withdraw
in
favor
of
another
candidate
,
to
whom
he
leave
the
advantage
of
his
canvass
machinery
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
call
this
a
strong
measure
,
but
observe
that
his
health
be
less
capable
of
sustain
excitement
than
he
have
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
feel
uneasy
about
the
chest
 
it
will
not
do
to
carry
that
too
far
,
"
he
say
to
Ladislaw
in
explain
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
pull
up

joy
in

satisfaction

her
emotion
by

flush
in

brightness
in

eye
which
give
an
old
woman
a
touching
momentary
identity
with

Mrs.

innocent
of
the

that

speak
rather
sharply

He
have
already
say
to
Dorothea

I
do
not

bind

up
St.

It
be
protest
enough
against
the
pluralism
they
want
to
reform
if
I
give
somebody
else
most
of
the
money

the
strong
thing
be
not

give
up
power

to
use
it
well

<EOS>
"
I
have
think
of
that

Dorothea

so
far
as
self

concern

I
think
it
would
be
easy
to
give
up
power

money

to
keep
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
very
unfitting
that
I
should
have
this
patronage

I
feel
that
I
ought

be
one
of

gall
them

<EOS>
He
make
no
display
of
humility
on
the
subject

but
in
his
heart
he
feel
rather
ashamed
that
his
conduct
have
show
lache
which
other
who
do
not
get
benefice
be
free
from

<EOS>
"
I
use
often
to
wish
I
have
be
something
else
than
a
clergyman

he
say
to
Lydgate
,
"
but
perhaps
it
will
be
well
to
try
and
make
as
good
a

out
of
myself
as
I
can

<EOS>
that

well

feel
then

whom
we
have
amiably
ask
to
visit
us
,
and
who
break
his
leg
within
our
gate
.
  
<EOS>
hardly
a
week
later
,
Duty
present
itself
in
his
study
under
the
disguise
of
Fred
Vincy
,
now
return
from
Omnibus
College
with
his
bachelor
's
degree
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
ashamed
to
trouble
you
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
"
say
Fred
,
whose
fair
open
face
be
propitiate
,
"
but
you
be
the
only
friend
I
can
consult
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
everything
once
before
,
and
you
be
so
good
that
I
can
not
help
come
to
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
Fred
,
I
be
ready
to
hear
and
do
anything
I
can
,
"
say
the
Vicar
,
who
be
busy
pack
some
small
object
for
removal
,
and
go
on
with
his
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
 
<EOS>
"
Fred
hesitate
an
instant
and
then
go
on
plungingly
,
<EOS>
"
I
may
go
into
the
Church
now
;
and
really
,
look
where
I
may
,
I
can
not
see
anything
else
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
uncommonly
hard
on
my
father
to
say
so
,
after
he
have
spend
a
good
deal
of
money
in
educate
me
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
Fred
pause
again
an
instant
,
and
then
repeat
,
"
and
I
can
not
see
anything
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
talk
to
your
father
about
it
,
Fred
,
but
I
make
little
way
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
get
over
one
bridge
now
:
what
be
your
other
difficulty
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
merely
that
I
do
not
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
divinity
,
and
preaching
,
and
feel
oblige
to
look
serious
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
ride
across
country
,
and
do
as
other
man
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
I
want
to
be
a
bad
fellow
in
any
way
;
but
I
have
no
taste
for
the
sort
of
thing
people
expect
of
a
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
what
else
be
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
My
father
can
not
spare
me
any
capital
,
else
I
may
go
into
farming
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
no
room
for
me
in
his
trade
.
 
<EOS>
and
of
course
I
can
not
begin
to
study
for
law
or
physic
now
,
when
my
father
want
me
to
earn
something
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
say
I
be
wrong
to
go
into
the
Church
;
but
those
who
say
so
may
as
well
tell
me
to
go
into
the
backwood
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
's
voice
have
take
a
tone
of
grumble
remonstrance
,
and
Mr.
Farebrother
may
have
be
incline
to
smile
if
his
mind
have
not
be
too
busy
in
imagine
more
than
Fred
tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
difficulty
about
doctrine
 
about
the
Articles
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
try
hard
to
think
of
the
question
simply
for
Fred
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
suppose
the
article
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
prepared
with
any
argument
to
disprove
them
,
and
much
well
,
cleverer
fellow
than
I
be
go
in
for
them
entirely
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
rather
ridiculous
in
me
to
urge
scruple
of
that
sort
,
as
if
I
be
a
judge
,
"
say
Fred
,
quite
simply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
then
,
it
have
occur
to
you
that
you
may
be
a
fair
parish
priest
without
be
much
of
a
divine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
if
I
be
oblige
to
be
a
clergyman
,
I
shall
try
and
do
my
duty
,
though
I
may
not
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
any
body
ought
to
blame
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
for
go
into
the
Church
under
the
circumstance
?
 
<EOS>
that
depend
on
your
conscience
,
Fred
 
how
far
you
have
count
the
cost
,
and
see
what
your
position
will
require
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
tell
you
about
myself
,
that
I
have
always
be
too
lax
,
and
have
be
uneasy
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
there
be
another
hindrance
,
"
say
Fred
,
color
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
tell
you
before
,
though
perhaps
I
may
have
say
thing
that
make
you
guess
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
somebody
I
be
very
fond
of
:
I
have
love
her
ever
since
we
be
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Garth
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
the
Vicar
,
examine
some
label
very
closely
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
mind
anything
if
she
would
have
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
know
I
could
be
a
good
fellow
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
think
she
return
the
feeling
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
never
will
say
so
;
and
a
good
while
ago
she
make
me
promise
not
to
speak
to
her
about
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
set
her
mind
especially
against
my
be
a
clergyman
;
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
give
her
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
think
she
care
about
me

<EOS>
I
see
Mrs.
Garth
last
night
,
and
she
say
that
Mary
be
stay
at
Lowick
Rectory
with
Miss
Farebrother

<EOS>

yes

very
kindly

my
sister

you

to
go
there

<EOS>
"
no

I
want
to
ask
a
great
favor
of
you

<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
bother
you
in
this
way
;
but
Mary
may
listen
to
what
you
say
,
if
you
mention
the
subject
to
her
 
<EOS>
I
mean
about
my
go
into
the
Church

<EOS>
"
that
be
rather
a
delicate
task
,
my
dear
Fred

<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
presuppose
your
attachment
to
her
;
and
to
enter
on
the
subject
as
you
wish
me
to
do

will
be
ask

tell
me
whether
she

it

You
mean
that
you
would

guide
by
that

your
going

if
Mary
say
she
would
never

me
I
may
as
well
go
wrong
in
one
way
as
another

nonsense

Fred

the
consequence

their
recklessness

not
my

I
have
never

Mary

her
up

it

no

She
respect
you
more

she
would
not
put
you
off
with
fun

she

me

course
I
could
not
have
tell
any

else

ask
any

you

there
be
no

such
a

<EOS>
Fred
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
rather
complainingly
,
"
<EOS>
and
she
ought
to
acknowledge
that
I
have
work
in
order
to
pass

She
ought

believe
that
I
would
exert
myself
for
her

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
's
silence
before
Mr.
Farebrother
lay
down
his
work
,
and
put
out
his
hand
to
Fred
say
    
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
my
boy

I
will
do
what
you
wish

that
very
day
Mr.

to
Lowick

the
nag

he
have
just
set
up

decidedly
I

old
stalk

the
young
growth

me
aside

He
find
Mary
in
the
garden
gathering
rose

sprinkle
the
petal
on
a
sheet

the
sun
be
low
,
and
tall
tree
send
their
shadow
across
the
grassy
walk
where
Mary
be
move
without
bonnet
or
parasol
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
observe
Mr.
Farebrother
's
approach
along
the
grass
,
and
have
just
stoop
down
to
lecture
a
small
black
-
and
-
tan
terrier
,
which
would
persist
in
walk
on
the
sheet
and
smell
at
the
rose
-
leave
as
Mary
sprinkle
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
his
fore
-
paw
in
one
hand
,
and
lift
up
the
forefinger
of
the
other

while
the
dog
wrinkle
his
brow
and
look
embarrassed

<EOS>
"
Fly
,
Fly
,
I
be
ashamed
of
you

Mary
be
say
in
a
grave
contralto
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
not
become
in
a
sensible
dog

anybody
would

you

a
silly
young

You
be
unmerciful

the
Vicar

within
two
yard
of
her

Mary
start
up
and
blush

"
It
always
answer
to
reason
with
Fly

,
laughingly

not
with
young
gentleman

oh
,
with
some
,
I
suppose
;

some
of
them
turn
into
excellent
man

<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
that
admission

you

young
gentleman

"
not
a
silly
one

say
Mary
,
begin
to
pluck
the
rose
again
,

feel
her
heart
beat
uncomfortably
.

no
;

perhaps
wisdom
be
not
his
strong
point
,

rather
affection

sincerity

<EOS>
however
,
wisdom
lie
more
in
those
two
quality
than
people
be
apt

yes

I
think
I
do

Mary

bravely

face
get
more
serious

and
her
hand
cold
;
"
it
must
be
Fred
Vincy

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
ask
me
to
consult
you
about
his
go
into
the
Church

I
hope
you
will
not
think
that
I
consent
to
take
a
liberty
in
promise
to
do
so

"
on
the
contrary
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
"
say
Mary
,
give
up
the
rose
,
and
fold
her
arm
,
but
unable
to
look
up
,
"
whenever
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
I
feel
honored
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
before
I
enter
on
that
question
,
let
me
just
touch
a
point
on
which
your
father
take
me
into
confidence
;
by
the
way
,
it
be
that
very
evening
on
which
I
once
before
fulfil
a
mission
from
Fred
,
just
after
he
have
go
to
college
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Garth
tell
me
what
happen
on
the
night
of
Featherstone
's
death
 
how
you
refuse
to
burn
the
will
;
and
he
say
that
you
have
some
heart
-
pricking
on
that
subject
,
because
you
have
be
the
innocent
mean
of
hinder
Fred
from
get
his
ten
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
keep
that
in
mind
,
and
I
have
hear
something
that
may
relieve
you
on
that
score
 
may
show
you
that
no
sin
-
offering
be
demand
from
you
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
pause
a
moment
and
look
at
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
He
mean
to
give
Fred
his
full
advantage
,
but
it
would
be
well
,
he
think
,
to
clear
her
mind
of
any
superstition
,
such
as
woman
sometimes
follow
when
they
do
a
man
the
wrong
of
marry
him
as
an
act
of
atonement
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
's
cheek
have
begin
to
burn
a
little
,
and
she
be
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
that
your
action
make
no
real
difference
to
Fred
's
lot
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
the
first
will
would
not
have
be
legally
good
after
the
burning
of
the
last
;
it
would
not
have
stand
if
it
have
be
dispute
,
and
you
may
be
sure
it
would
have
be
dispute
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
on
that
score
,
you
may
feel
your
mind
free
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
"
say
Mary
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
grateful
to
you
for
remember
my
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
now
I
may
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
,
you
know
,
have
take
his
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
work
his
way
so
far
,
and
now
the
question
be
,
what
be
he
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
that
question
be
so
difficult
that
he
be
inclined
to
follow
his
father
's
wish
and
enter
the
Church
,
though
you
know
better
than
I
do
that
he
be
quite
set
against
that
formerly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
question
him
on
the
subject
,
and
I
confess
I
see
no
insuperable
objection
to
his
be
a
clergyman
,
as
thing
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
he
could
turn
his
mind
to
do
his
good
in
that
vocation
,
on
one
condition
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
condition
be
fulfil
I
would
do
my
utmost
in
help
Fred
on
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
time
 
not
,
of
course
,
at
first
 
he
may
be
with
me
as
my
curate
,
and
he
would
have
so
much
to
do
that
his
stipend
would
be
nearly
what
I
use
to
get
as
vicar
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
repeat
that
there
be
a
condition
without
which
all
this
good
can
not
come
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
open
his
heart
to
me
,
Miss
Garth
,
and
ask
me
to
plead
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
condition
lie
entirely
in
your
feeling
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
look
so
much
moved
,
that
he
say
after
a
moment
,
"
let
us
walk
a
little
;
"
and
when
they
be
walk
he
add
,
"
to
speak
quite
plainly
,
Fred
will
not
take
any
course
which
would
lessen
the
chance
that
you
would
consent
to
be
his
wife
;
but
with
that
prospect

since

so
much

hurt
myself

I

weak

should
like
better
than
anything

him
worthy

please
tell
him
I
will
not

It

insincerity

dead

<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
when
he
be
hope
to
acquire
a
new
interest
in
Lowick
,
have
naturally
have
an
especial
wish
that
the
new
clergyman
should
be
one
whom
he
thoroughly
approve
;
and
he
believe
it
to
be
a
chastisement
and
admonition
direct
to
his
own
shortcoming
and
those
of
the
nation
at
large
,
that
just
about
the
time
when
he
come
in
possession
of
the
deed
which
make
him
the
proprietor
of
Stone
Court
,
Mr.
Farebrother
"
read
himself
"
into
the
quaint
little
church
and
preach
his
first
sermon
to
the
congregation
of
farmer
,
laborer
,
and
village
artisan
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
intend
to
frequent
Lowick
Church
or
to
reside
at
Stone
Court
for
a
good
while
to
come
:
he
have
buy
the
excellent
farm
and
fine
homestead
simply
as
a
retreat
which
he
may
gradually
enlarge
as
to
the
land
and
beautify
as
to
the
dwelling
,
until
it
should
be
conducive
to
the
divine
glory
that
he
should
enter
on
it
as
a
residence
,
partially
withdraw
from
his
present
exertion
in
the
administration
of
business
,
and
throw
more
conspicuously
on
the
side
of
Gospel
truth
the
weight
of
local
landed
proprietorship
,
which
Providence
may
increase
by
unforeseen
occasion
of
purchase
.
 
<EOS>
a
strong
leading
in
this
direction
seem
to
have
be
give
in
the
surprising
facility
of
get
Stone
Court
,
when
every
one
have
expect
that
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
would
have
cling
to
it
as
the
Garden
of
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
poor
old
Peter
himself
have
expect
;
have
often
,
in
imagination
,
look
up
through
the
sod
above
him
,
and
,
unobstructed
by
perspective
,
see
his
frog
-
face
legatee
enjoy
the
fine
old
place
to
the
perpetual
surprise
and
disappointment
of
other
survivor
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
little
we
know
what
would
make
paradise
for
our
neighbor
!
 
<EOS>
We
judge
from
our
own
desire
,
and
our
neighbor
themselves
be
not
always
open
enough
even
to
throw
out
a
hint
of
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
the
cool
and
judicious
Joshua
Rigg
have
not
allow
his
parent
to
perceive
that
Stone
Court
be
anything
less
than
the
chief
good
in
his
estimation
,
and
he
have
certainly
wish
to
call
it
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
Warren
Hastings
look
at
gold
and
thought
of
buy
Daylesford
,
so
Joshua
Rigg
look
at
Stone
Court
and
thought
of
buy
gold
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
distinct
and
intense
vision
of
his
chief
good
,
<EOS>
the
vigorous
greed
which
he
have
inherit
have
take
a
special
form
by
dint
of
circumstance
:
and
his
chief
good
be
to
be
a
moneychanger
.
 
<EOS>
from
his
early
employment
as
an
errand
-
boy
in
a
seaport
,
he
have
look
through
the
window
of
the
moneychanger
as
other
boy
look
through
the
window
of
the
pastry
-
cook
;
the
fascination
have
work
itself
gradually
into
a
deep
special
passion
;
he
mean
,
when
he
have
property
,
to
do
many
thing
,
one
of
them
be
to
marry
a
genteel
young
person
;
but
these
be
all
accident
and
joy
that
imagination
could
dispense
with
.
 
<EOS>
the
one
joy
after
which
his
soul
thirst
be
to
have
a
money
-
changer
's
shop
on
a
much
-
frequented
quay
,
to
have
lock
all
round
him
of
which
he
hold
the
key
,
and
to
look
sublimely
cool
as
he
handle
the
breeding
coin
of
all
nation
,
while
helpless
Cupidity
look
at
him
enviously
from
the
other
side
of
an
iron
lattice
.
 
<EOS>
the
strength
of
that
passion
have
be
a
power
enable
him
to
master
all
the
knowledge
necessary
to
gratify
it
.
<EOS>
and
when
other
be
think
that
he
have
settle
at
Stone
Court
for
life
,
Joshua
himself
be
think
that
the
moment
now
be
not
far
off
when
he
should
settle
on
the
North
Quay
with
the
good
appointment
in
safe
and
lock
.
  
<EOS>
enough
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
concerned
with
look
at
Joshua
Rigg
's
sale
of
his
land
from
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
point
of
view
,
and
he
interpret
it
as
a
cheer
dispensation
convey
perhaps
a
sanction
to
a
purpose
which
he
have
for
some
time
entertain
without
external
encouragement
;
he
interpret
it
thus
,
but
not
too
confidently
,
offer
up
his
thanksgiving
in
guard
phraseology
.
 
<EOS>
His
doubt
do
not
arise
from
the
possible
relation
of
the
event
to
Joshua
Rigg
's
destiny
,
which
belong
to
the
unmapped
region
not
take
under
the
providential
government
,
except
perhaps
in
an
imperfect
colonial
way
;
but
they
arise
from
reflect
that
this
dispensation
too
may
be
a
chastisement
for
himself
,
as
Mr.
Farebrother
's
induction
to
the
living
clearly
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
what
Mr.
Bulstrode
say
to
any
man
for
the
sake
of
deceive
him
:
<EOS>
it
be
what
he
say
to
himself
 
<EOS>
it
be
as
genuinely
his
mode
of
explain
event
as
any
theory
of
yours
may
be
,
if
you
happen
to
disagree
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
egoism
which
enter
into
our
theory
do
not
affect
their
sincerity
;
rather
,
the
more
our
egoism
be
satisfied
,
the
more
robust
be
our
belief
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
whether
for
sanction
or
for
chastisement
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
hardly
fifteen
month
after
the
death
of
Peter
Featherstone
,
have
become
the
proprietor
of
Stone
Court
,
and
what
Peter
would
say
"
if
he
be
worthy
to
know
,
"
have
become
an
inexhaustible
and
consolatory
subject
of
conversation
to
his
disappointed
relative

<EOS>
the
table
be

on
that
dear
brother
depart

and
to
contemplate
the
frustration
of
his
cunning
by
the
superior
cunning

Mrs.

a
melancholy
triumph

the
proof
that
it
do
not

make
false
Featherstones

Affectionate

few
day
pass
without

over

part

evening
be
delicious
in

quiet
spot

lately
set
up

send
forth

mingle
with

one
evening
,
while
the
sun

<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
conscious
of
be
in
a
good
spiritual
frame
and
more
than
usually
serene
,
under
the
influence
of
his
innocent
recreation
.
<EOS>
He
be
doctrinally
convinced
that
there
be
a
total
absence
of
merit
in
himself
;
but
that
doctrinal
conviction
may
be
hold
without
pain
when
the
sense
of
demerit
do
not
take
a
distinct
shape
in
memory
and
revive
the
tingling
of
shame
or
the
pang
of
remorse
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
may
be
hold
with
intense
satisfaction
when
the
depth
of
our
sinning
be
but
a
measure
for
the
depth
of
forgiveness

and
a
clench
proof
that
we
be
peculiar
instrument
of
the
divine
intention

hope

effect

have

lucid
vision

difficulty
there
would
be
in
arrange
any
result
that
could
be
permanently
count
on
with

spirit
of
evil
may
have
send
him
to
threaten
Mr.

's
subversion
as
an
instrument
of
good
;
but
the
threat
must
have
be
permit
,
and
be
a
chastisement

a
new
kind

<EOS>
It
be
an
hour
of
anguish
for
him
very
different
from
the
hour
in
which
his
struggle
have
be
securely
private
,
and
which
have
end
with
a
sense
that
his
secret
misdeed
be
pardon
and
his
service
accept
.
 
<EOS>
those
misdeed
even
when
commit
 
have
they
not
be
half
sanctify
by
the
singleness
of
his
desire
to
devote
himself
and
all
he
possess
to
the
furtherance
of
the
divine
scheme

and
be
he
after

who
would
understand

who
would
not

there
be
the
pretext

cast
disgrace
upon
him

confound
his
whole
life

the
truth
he
have
espouse
,
in
one
heap
of
obloquy
?
  
<EOS>
in
his
close
meditation
the
life
-
long
habit
of
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
mind
clothe
his
most
egoistic
terror
in
doctrinal
reference
to
superhuman
end

even

what
we

now
within

be
the
forecast

for
the
pain

as
well

estimate

depend
on
the
amount

to

only
aim

have
aim
at
be
an

It
be
not
more
than
half
-
past
seven

the
morning
when

Stone
Court

<EOS>
the
fine
old
place
never
look
more
like
a
delightful
home
than
at
that
moment

the
great
white
lily
be
in
flower
,
the
nasturtium
,
their
pretty
leave
all
silver
with
dew
,
be
run
away
over
the
low
stone
wall
;
the
very
noise
all
around
have
a
heart
of
peace
within
them

but
everything
be
spoil
for
the
owner
as
he
walk
on
the
gravel
in
front
and
await
the
descent
of
Mr.
Raffles
,
with
whom
he
be
condemn
to
breakfast

It
be
not
long
before
they
be
seat
together
in

parlor
over
their
tea

toast

which
be
as
much
as
Raffles
care

take
at

early
hour

<EOS>
the
difference
between
his
morning
and
evening
self
be
not
so
great
as
his
companion
have
imagine
that
it
may
be
;
the
delight
in
tormenting
be
perhaps
even
the
strong
because
his
spirit
be
rather
less
highly
pitch

certainly
his
manner
seem
more
disagreeable
by

morning
light

at

His

really
think

Mr.

feel

be
consider
diligently

Mr.

he
presently

half
aloud

scratch
his

wrinkle
his

horizontally

He
have
not
really
care
or
think
about
this
point

forgetfulness
until
it
occur
to
him

his
invention

annoyance
for

go
on

with
a
sense
that
he
be
get
hold

slippery

the
hold
be
too
slight

he
soon
get
tired

for
few

be
more
impatient

more
in

prefer
use
his

pleasant
conversation
with

from
whom
he
gather
as
much
as
he
want
to
know
about
Mr.

position
in
Middlemarch

<EOS>
after
all
,
however
,
there
be
a
dull
space
of
time
which
need
relieve
with
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
,
and
when
he
be
seat
alone
with
these
resource
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
,
he
suddenly
slap
his
knee
,
and
exclaim
,
"
Ladislaw

<EOS>
that
action
of
memory

suddenly
complete
itself

a

agreeable

Raffles
immediately
take
out
his
pocket

book

and
write
down
the

not
because
he
expect
to
use
it

merely
for
the

not

at
a
loss
if
he
ever
do
happen

it

<EOS>
He
be
not
go

there

<EOS>
by
that
delightful
morning
when
the
hay
-
rick
at
Stone
Court
be
scent
the
air
quite
impartially
,
as
if
Mr.
Raffles
have
be
a
guest
worthy
of
fine
incense
,
Dorothea
have
again
take
up
her
abode
at
Lowick
Manor
.
 
<EOS>
after
three
month
Freshitt
have
become
rather
oppressive
:
to
sit
like
a
model
for
Saint
Catherine
look
rapturously
at
Celia
's
baby
would
not
do
for
many
hour
in
the
day
,
and
to
remain
in
<EOS>
that
momentous
babe
's
presence
with
persistent
disregard
be
a
course
that
could
not
have
be
tolerate
in
a
childless
sister
.
<EOS>
Dorothea
would
have
be
capable
of
carry
baby
joyfully
for
a
mile
if
there
have
be
need
,
and
of
love
it
the
more
tenderly
for
that
labor
;
but
to
an
aunt
who
do
not
recognize
her
infant
nephew
as
Bouddha
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
for
him
but
to
admire
,
his
behavior
be
apt
to
appear
monotonous
,
and
the
interest
of
watch
him
exhaustible
.
<EOS>
this
possibility
be
quite
hide
from
Celia
,
who
feel
that
Dorothea
's
childless
widowhood
fall
in
quite
prettily
with
the
birth
of
little
Arthur
<EOS>
(
baby
be
name
after
Mr.
Brooke
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dodo
be
just
the
creature
not
to
mind
about
have
anything
of
her
own
 
child
or
anything
!
"
say
Celia
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
she
have
have
a
baby
,
it
never
could
have
be
such
a
dear
as
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
,
James
?
  
<EOS>
"
not
if
it
have
be
like
Casaubon
,
"
say
Sir
James
,
conscious
of
some
indirectness
in
his
answer
,
and
of
hold
a
strictly
private
opinion
as
to
the
perfection
of
his
first
-
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
just
imagine
!
 
<EOS>
really
it
be
a
mercy
,
"
say
Celia
;
"
and
I
think
it
be
very
nice
for
Dodo
to
be
a
widow
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
be
just
as
fond
of
our
baby
as
if
it
be
her
own
,
and
she
can
have
as
many
notion
of
her
own
as
she
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
she
be
not
a
queen
,
"
say
the
devout
Sir
James
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
should
we
have
be
then
?
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
be
something
else
,
"
say
Celia
,
object
to
so
laborious
a
flight
of
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
her
better
as
she
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
hence
,
when
she
find
that
Dorothea
be
make
arrangement
for
her
final
departure
to
Lowick
,
Celia
raise
her
eyebrow
with
disappointment
,
and
in
her
quiet
unemphatic
way
shoot
a
needle
-
arrow
of
sarcasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
will
you
do
at
Lowick
,
Dodo
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
yourself
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
there
<EOS>
:
everybody
be
so
clean
and
well
off
,
it
make
you
quite
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
you
have
be
so
happy
go
all
about
Tipton
with
Mr.
Garth
into
the
bad
backyard
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
uncle
be
abroad
,
<EOS>
you
and
Mr.
Garth
can
have
it
all
your
own
way
;
and
I
be
sure
James
do
everything
you
tell
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
often
come
here
,
and
I
shall
see
how
baby
grow
all
the
well
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
never
see
him
wash
,
"
say
Celia
;
"
and
that
be
quite
the
good
part
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
almost
pouting
:
it
do
seem
to
her
very
hard
in
Dodo
to
go
away
from
the
baby
when
she
may
stay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Kitty
,
I
will
come
and
stay
all
night
on
purpose
,
"
say
Dorothea
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
want
to
be
alone
now
,
and
in
my
own
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
know
the
farebrother
better
,
and
to
talk
to
Mr.
Farebrother
about
what
there
be
to
be
do
in
Middlemarch

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
native
strength
of
will
be
no
longer
all
convert
into
resolute
submission
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
yearning
to
be
at
Lowick
,
and
be
simply
determined
to
go
,
not
feel
bind
to
tell
all
her
reason
.
<EOS>
but
every
one
around
her
disapprove
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
be
much
pain
,
and
offer
that
they
should
all
migrate
to
Cheltenham
for
a
few
month
with
the
sacred
ark
,
otherwise
call
a
cradle
:
at
that
period
a
man
could
hardly
know
what
to
propose
if
Cheltenham
be
reject
.
  
<EOS>
the
Dowager
Lady
Chettam
,
just
return
from
a
visit
to
her
daughter
in
town
,
wish
,
at
least
,
that
Mrs.
Vigo
should
be
write
to
,
and
invite
to
accept
the
office
of
companion
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
:
it
be
not
credible
that
Dorothea
as
a
young
widow
would
think
of
live
alone
in
the
house
at
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vigo
have
be
reader
and
secretary
to
royal
personage
,
and
in
point
of
knowledge
and
sentiment
even
Dorothea
could
have
nothing
to
object
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
,
privately
,
"
You
will
certainly
go
mad
in
that
house
alone
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
see
vision
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
all
get
to
exert
ourselves
a
little
to
keep
sane
,
and
call
thing
by
the
same
name
as
other
people
call
them
by
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
for
young
son
and
woman
who
have
no
money
,
it
be
a
sort
of
provision
to
go
mad
:
they
be
take
care
of
then
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
run
into
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
be
a
little
bored
here
with
our
good
dowager
;
but
think
what
a
bore
you
may
become
yourself
to
your
fellow
-
creature
if
you
be
always
play
tragedy
queen
and
take
thing
sublimely
.
 
<EOS>
sit
alone
in
that
library
at
Lowick
<EOS>
you
may
fancy
yourself
rule
the
weather
;
you
must
get
a
few
people
round
you
who
would
not
believe
you
if
you
tell
them
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
good
lowering
medicine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
call
everything
by
the
same
name
that
all
the
people
about
me
do
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
suppose
you
have
find
out
your
mistake
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
"
and
that
be
a
proof
of
sanity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
aware
of
the
sting
,
but
it
do
not
hurt
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
still
think
that
the
great
part
of
the
world
be
mistake
about
many
thing
.
 
<EOS>
surely
one
may
be
sane
and
yet
think
so
,
since
the
great
part
of
the
world
have
often
have
to
come
round
from
its
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
no
more
on
that
point
to
Dorothea
,
but
to
her
husband
she
remark
,
"
It
will
be
well
for
her
to
marry
again
as
soon
as
it
be
proper
,
if
one
could
get
her
among
the
right
people
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
the
Chettams
would
not
wish
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
clearly
a
husband
be
the
good
thing
to
keep
her
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
be
not
so
poor
I
would
invite
Lord
Triton
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
marquis
some
day
,
and
there
be
no
denying
that
she
would
make
a
good
marchioness
<EOS>
:
she
look
handsome
than
ever
in
her
mourning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Elinor
,
do
let
the
poor
woman
alone
.
 
<EOS>
such
contrivance
be
of
no
use
,
"
say
the
easy
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
use
?
 
<EOS>
how
be
match
make
,
except
by
bring
man
and
woman
together
?
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
shame
that
her
uncle
should
have
run
away
and
shut
up
the
grange
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
eligible
match
invite
to
Freshitt
and
the
grange
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Triton
be
precisely
the
man
:
full
of
plan
for
make
the
people
happy
in
a
soft
-
headed
sort
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
just
suit
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
Mrs.
Casaubon
choose
for
herself
,
Elinor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
nonsense
you
wise
man
talk
!
 
<EOS>
how
can
she
choose
if
she
have
no
variety
to
choose
from
?
 
<EOS>
a
woman
's
choice
usually
mean
take
the
only
man
she
can
get
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
my
word
,
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
if
her
friend
do
not
exert
themselves
,
there
will
be
a
bad
business
than
the
Casaubon
business
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
for
heaven
's
sake
do
not
touch
on
that
topic
,
Elinor
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
sore
point
with
Sir
James
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
deeply
offend
if
you
enter
on
it
to
him
unnecessarily
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
enter
on
it
,
"
say
Mrs
Cadwallader
,
open
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Celia
tell
me
all
about
the
will
at
the
beginning
,
without
any
asking
of
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
;
but
they
want
the
thing
hush
up
,
and
I
understand
that
the
young
fellow
be
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
nothing
,
but
give
her
husband
three
significant
nod
,
with
a
very
sarcastic
expression
in
her
dark
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
quietly
persist
in
spite
of
remonstrance
and
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
so
by
the
end
of
June
the
shutter
be
all
open
at
Lowick
Manor
,
and
the
morning
gaze
calmly
into
the
library
,
shine
on
the
row
of
note
-
book
as
it
shine
on
the
weary
waste
plant
with
huge
stone
,
the
mute
memorial
of
a
forget
faith
;
and
the
evening
laden
with
rose
enter
silently
into
the
blue
-
green
boudoir
where
Dorothea
choose
oftenest
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
she
walk
into
every
room
,
question
the
eighteen
month
of
her
married
life
,
and
carry
on
her
thought
as
if
they
be
a
speech
to
be
hear
by
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
she
linger
in
the
library
and
could
not
be
at
rest
till
she
have
carefully
range
all
the
note
-
book
as
she
imagine
that
he
would
wish
to
see
them
,
in
orderly
sequence
.
 
<EOS>
the
pity
which
have
be
the
restrain
compelling
motive
in
her
life
with
him
still
clung
about
his
image
,
even
while
she
remonstrate
with
him
in
indignant
thought
and
tell
him
that
he
be
unjust
.
 
<EOS>
one
little
act
of
her
may
perhaps
be
smile
at
as
superstitious
.
 
<EOS>
the
Synoptical
Tabulation
for
the
use
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
<EOS>
,
she
carefully
enclose
and
seal
,
write
within
the
envelope
,
"
I
could
not
use
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
not
see
now
that
I
could
not
submit
my
soul
to
yours
,
by
work
hopelessly
at
what
I
have
no
belief
in
 
Dorothea
?
<EOS>
"
then
she
deposit
the
paper
in
her
own
desk
.
  
<EOS>
that
silent
colloquy
be
perhaps
only
the
more
earnest
because
underneath
and
through
it
all
there
be
always
the
deep
longing
which
have
really
determine
her
to
come
to
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
the
longing
be
to
see
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
any
good
that
could
come
of
their
meeting
<EOS>
:
she
be
helpless
;
her
hand
have
be
tie
from
make
up
to
him
for
any
unfairness
in
his
lot
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
soul
thirst
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
if
a
princess
in
the
day
of
enchantment
have
see
a
four
-
footed
creature
from
among
those
which
live
in
herd
come
to
her
once
and
again
with
a
human
gaze
which
rest
upon
her
with
choice
and
beseeching
,
what
would
she
think
of
in
her
journeying
<EOS>
,
what
would
she
look
for
when
the
herd
pass
her
?
 
<EOS>
surely
for
the
gaze
which
have
find
her
,
and
which
she
would
know
again
.
 
<EOS>
life
would
be
no
well
than
candle
-
light
tinsel
and
daylight
rubbish
if
our
spirit
be
not
touch
by
what
have
be
,
to
issue
of
longing
and
constancy
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Dorothea
want
to
know
the
farebrother
better
,
and
especially
to
talk
to
the
new
rector
,
but
also
true
that
remember
what
Lydgate
have
tell
her
about
Will
Ladislaw
and
little
Miss
Noble
,
she
count
on
Will
be
come
to
Lowick
to
see
the
Farebrother
family
.
<EOS>
the
very
first
Sunday
,
_
before
_
she
enter
the
church
,
she
see
him
as
she
have
see
him
the
last
time
she
be
there
,
alone
in
the
clergyman
's
pew
;
but
_
when
_
she
enter
his
figure
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
week
-
day
when
she
go
to
see
the
lady
at
the
Rectory
,
she
listen
in
vain
for
some
word
that
they
may
let
fall
about
Will
;
but
it
seem
to
her
that
Mrs.
Farebrother
talk
of
every
one
else
in
the
neighborhood
and
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
probably
some
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
Middlemarch
hearer
may
follow
him
to
Lowick
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
so
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
rather
despise
herself
for
have
a
secret
motive
in
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
be
wise
they
will
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
"
say
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
set
a
right
value
on
my
son
's
preaching
.
 
<EOS>
His
grandfather
on
my
side
be
an
excellent
clergyman
,
but
his
father
be
in
the
law
:
 
most
exemplary
and
honest
nevertheless
,
which
be
a
reason
for
our
never
be
rich
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
Fortune
be
a
woman
and
capricious
.
 
<EOS>
but
sometimes
she
be
a
good
woman
and
give
to
those
who
merit
,
which
have
be
the
case
with
you
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
who
have
give
a
living
to
my
son

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Farebrother
recur
to
her
knitting
with
a
dignified
satisfaction
in
her
neat
little
effort
at
oratory
,
but
this
be
not
what
Dorothea
want
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
do
not
even
know
whether
Will
Ladislaw
be
still
at
Middlemarch

and
there
be
no
one
whom
she
dare
to
ask
,
unless
it
be
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
but
just
now
she
could
not
see
Lydgate
without
send
for
him
or
go
to
seek
him
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
Will
Ladislaw
,
have
hear
of
that
strange
ban
against
him
leave
by
Mr.
Casaubon
,
have
feel
it
well
that
he
and
she
should
not
meet
again
,
and
perhaps
she
be
wrong
to
wish
for
a
meeting
that
other
may
find
many
good
reason
against
.
 
<EOS>
still
"
I
do
wish
it
"
come
at
the
end
of
those
wise
reflection
as
naturally
as
a
sob
after
hold
the
breath
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
meeting
do
happen
,
but
in
a
formal
way
quite
unexpected
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
eleven
,
Dorothea
be
seat
in
her
boudoir
with
a
map
of
the
land
attach
to
the
manor
and
other
paper
before
her
,
which
be
to
help
her
in
make
an
exact
statement
for
herself
of
her
income
and
affair
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
apply
herself
to
her
work
,
but
be
seat
with
her
hand
fold
on
her
lap
,
look
out
along
the
avenue
of
limes
to
the
distant
field
.
 
<EOS>
every
leaf
be
at
rest
in
the
sunshine
,
the
familiar
scene
be
changeless
,
and
seem
to
represent
the
prospect
of
her
life
,
full
of
motiveless
ease
 
motiveless
,
if
her
own
energy
could
not
seek
out
reason
for
ardent
action
.
 
<EOS>
the
widow
's
cap
of
those
time
make
an
oval
frame
for
the
face
,
and
have
a
crown
stand
up
;
the
dress
be
an
experiment
in
the
utmost
lay
on
of
crape
;
but
this
heavy
solemnity
of
clothing
make
her
face
look
all
the
young
,
with
its
recovered
bloom
,
and
the
sweet
,
inquire
candor
of
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Her
reverie
be
break
by
Tantripp
,
who
come
to
say
that
Mr.
Ladislaw
be
below
,
and
beg
permission
to
see
Madam
if
it
be
not
too
early
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
him
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
rise
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
him
be
show
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
drawing
-
room
be
the
most
neutral
room
in
the
house
to
her
 
<EOS>
the
one
least
associate
with
the
trial
of
her
married
life
<EOS>
:
the
damask
match
the
wood
-
work
,
which
be
all
white
and
gold
;
there
be
two
tall
mirror
and
table
with
nothing
on
them
 
in
brief
,
it
be
a
room
where
you
have
no
reason
for
sit
in
one
place
rather
than
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
below
the
boudoir
,
and
have
also
a
bow
-
window
look
out
on
the
avenue
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
Pratt
show
Will
ladislaw
into
it
the
window
be
open
;
and
a
winged
visitor
,
buzz
in
and
out
now
and
then
without
mind
the
furniture
,
make
the
room
look
less
formal
and
uninhabited
.
  
<EOS>
"
glad
to
see
you
here
again
,
sir
,
"
say
Pratt
,
linger
to
adjust
a
blind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
come
to
say
good
-
by
,
Pratt
,
"
say
Will
,
who
wish
even
the
butler
to
know
that
he
be
too
proud
to
hang
about
Mrs.
Casaubon
<EOS>
now
she
be
a
rich
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
sorry
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
"
say
Pratt
,
retire
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
as
a
servant
who
be
to
be
tell
nothing
,
he
know
the
fact
of
which
Ladislaw
be
still
ignorant
,
and
have
draw
his
inference
;
indeed
,
have
not
differ
from
his
betrothed
Tantripp
when
she
say
,
"
Your
master
be
as
jealous
as
a
fiend
 
and
no
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Madam
would
look
high
than
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
else
I
do
not
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
maid
say
there
be
a
lord
come
who
be
to
marry
her
when
the
mourning
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
moment
for
Will
to
walk
about
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
before
Dorothea
enter
.
 
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
very
different
from
that
first
meeting
in
Rome
when
Will
have
be
embarrassed
and
Dorothea
calm
.
<EOS>
this
time
he
feel
miserable
but
determined
,
while
she
be
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
could
not
be
hide
.
 
<EOS>
just
outside
the
door
she
have
feel
that
this
long
-
for
meeting
be
after
all
too
difficult
,
and
when
she
see
Will
advance
towards
her
,
the
deep
blush
which
be
rare
in
her
come
with
painful
suddenness
.
 
<EOS>
neither
of
them
know
how
it
be
,
but
neither
of
them
speak
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
her
hand
for
a
moment
,
and
then
they
go
to
sit
down
near
the
window
,
<EOS>
she
on
one
settee
and
he
on
another
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
peculiarly
uneasy
<EOS>
:
it
seem
to
him
not
like
Dorothea
that
the
mere
fact
of
her
be
a
widow
should
cause
such
a
change
in
her
manner
of
receive
him
;
and
he
know
of
no
other
condition
which
could
have
affect
their
previous
relation
to
each
other
 
except
that
,
as
his
imagination
at
once
tell
him
,
her
friend
may
have
be
poison
her
mind
with
their
suspicion
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
presume
too
much
in
call
,
"
say
Will
;
"
I
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
neighborhood
and
begin
a
new
life
without
see
you
to
say
good
-
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
presume
?
 
<EOS>
surely
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
it
unkind
if
you
have
not
wish
to
see
me
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
her
habit
of
speak
with
perfect
genuineness
assert
itself
through
all
her
uncertainty
and
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
away
immediately
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
soon
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
go
to
town
and
eat
my
dinner
as
a
barrister
,
since
,
they
say
,
that
be
the
preparation
for
all
public
business
.
 
<EOS>
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
political
work
to
be
do
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
I
mean
to
try
and
do
some
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
other
man
have
manage
to
win
an
honorable
position
for
themselves
without
family
or
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
will
make
it
all
the
more
honorable
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
ardently
.
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
you
have
so
many
talent
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
from
my
uncle
<EOS>
how
well
you
speak
in
public
,
so
that
every
one
be
sorry
when
you
leave
off
,
and
how
clearly
you
can
explain
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
care
that
justice
should
be
do
to
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
in
Rome
,
I
think
you
only
care
for
poetry
and
art
,
and
the
thing
that
adorn
life
for
us
who
be
well
off
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
know
you
think
about
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
speak
Dorothea
have
lose
her
personal
embarrassment
,
and
have
become
like
her
former
self
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
at
Will
with
a
direct
glance
,
full
of
delighted
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
approve
of
my
go
away
for
year
,
then
,
and
never
come
here
again
till
I
have
make
myself
of
some
mark
in
the
world
?
"
say
Will
,
try
hard
to
reconcile
the
utmost
pride
with
the
utmost
effort
to
get
an
expression
of
strong
feeling
from
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
aware
how
long
it
be
before
she
answer
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
turn
her
head
and
be
look
out
of
the
window
on
the
rose
-
bush
,
which
seem
to
have
in
them
the
summer
of
all
the
year
when
Will
would
be
away
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
judicious
behavior
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
never
think
of
study
her
manner
<EOS>
:
she
think
only
of
bow
to
a
sad
necessity
which
divide
her
from
Will
.
 
<EOS>
those
first
word
of
his
about
his
intention
have
seem
to
make
everything
clear
to
her
<EOS>
:
he
know
,
she
suppose
,
all
about
Mr.
Casaubon
's
final
conduct
in
relation
to
him
,
and
it
have
come
to
him
with
the
same
sort
of
shock
as
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
feel
more
than
friendship
for
her
 
have
never
have
anything
in
his
mind
to
justify
what
she
feel
to
be
her
husband
's
outrage
on
the
feeling
of
both
:
and
that
friendship
he
still
feel
.
 
<EOS>
something
which
may
be
call
an
inward
silent
sob
have
go
on
in
Dorothea
before
she
say
with
a
pure
voice
,
just
tremble
in
the
last
word
as
if
only
from
its
liquid
flexibility
    
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
must
be
right
for
you
to
do
as
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
happy
when
I
hear
that
you
have
make
your
value
feel
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
have
patience
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
perhaps
be
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
never
quite
know
how
it
be
that
he
save
himself
from
fall
down
at
her
foot
,
when
the
"
long
while
"
come
forth
with
its
gentle
tremor
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
say
that
the
horrible
hue
and
surface
of
her
crape
dress
be
most
likely
the
sufficient
controlling
force
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
still
,
however
,
and
only
say
    
"
I
shall
never
hear
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
forget
all
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
"
I
shall
never
forget
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
forget
any
one
whom
I
once
know
.
 
<EOS>
My
life
have
never
be
crowd
,
and
seem
not
likely
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
a
great
deal
of
space
for
memory
at
Lowick
,
have
not
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
 
<EOS>
Will
burst
out
passionately
,
rise
,
with
his
hat
still
in
his
hand
,
and
walk
away
to
a
marble
table
,
where
he
suddenly
turn
and
lean
his
back
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
blood
have
mount
to
his
face
and
neck
,
and
he
look
almost
angry
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
seem
to
him
as
if
they
be
like
two
creature
slowly
turn
to
marble
in
each
other
's
presence
,
while
their
heart
be
conscious
and
their
eye
be
yearn
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
never
be
true
of
him
that
in
this
meeting
to
which
he
have
come
with
bitter
resolution
he
have
end
by
a
confession
which
may
be
interpret
into
ask
for
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
actually
true
that
he
be
fearful
of
the
effect
which
such
confession
may
have
on
Dorothea
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
from
that
distance
in
some
trouble
,
imagine
that
there
may
have
be
an
offence
in
her
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
the
while
there
be
a
current
of
thought
in
her
about
his
probable
want
of
money
,
and
the
impossibility
of
her
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
her
uncle
have
be
at
home
,
something
may
have
be
do
through
him
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
preoccupation
with
the
hardship
of
Will
's
want
money
,
while
she
have
what
ought
to
have
be
his
share
,
which
lead
her
to
say
,
see
that
he
remain
silent
and
look
away
from
her
    
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
you
would
like
to
have
that
miniature
which
hang
up
-
stair
 
<EOS>
I
mean
that
beautiful
miniature
of
your
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
not
right
for
me
to
keep
it
,
if
you
would
wish
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderfully
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
,
"
say
Will
,
irritably
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
do
not
mind
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
consoling
to
have
one
's
own
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
more
consoling
if
other
want
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
like
to
cherish
her
memory
 
<EOS>
I
think
 
"
Dorothea
break
off
an
instant
,
her
imagination
suddenly
warn
her
away
from
Aunt
Julia
's
history
 
<EOS>
"
you
would
surely
like
to
have
the
miniature
as
a
family
memorial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
have
that
,
when
I
have
nothing
else
!
 
<EOS>
a
man
with
only
a
portmanteau
for
his
stowage
must
keep
his
memorial
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
Will
speak
at
random
:
he
be
merely
vent
his
petulance
;
it
be
a
little
too
exasperating
to
have
his
grandmother
's
portrait
offer
him
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
Dorothea
's
feel
his
word
have
a
peculiar
sting
.
 
<EOS>
She
rise
and
say
with
a
touch
of
indignation
as
well
as
hauteur
    
<EOS>
"
You
be
much
the
happy
of
us
two
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
to
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
be
startle
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
word
may
be
,
the
tone
seem
like
a
dismissal
;
and
quit
his
lean
posture
,
he
walk
a
little
way
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
Their
eye
meet
,
but
with
a
strange
questioning
gravity
.
<EOS>
something
be
keep
their
mind
aloof
,
and
each
be
leave
to
conjecture
what
be
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Will
have
really
never
think
of
himself
as
have
a
claim
of
inheritance
on
the
property
which
be
hold
by
Dorothea
,
and
would
have
require
a
narrative
to
make
him
understand
her
present
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
feel
it
a
misfortune
to
have
nothing
till
now
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
poverty
may
be
as
bad
as
leprosy
,
if
it
divide
us
from
what
we
most
care
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
cut
Dorothea
to
the
heart
,
and
make
her
relent
.
 
<EOS>
She
answer
in
a
tone
of
sad
fellowship
.
  
<EOS>
"
sorrow
come
in
so
many
way
.
 
<EOS>
two
year
ago
I
have
no
notion
of
that
 
<EOS>
I
mean
of
the
unexpected
way
in
which
trouble
come
,
and
tie
our
hand
,
and
make
us
silent
when
we
long
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
despise
woman
a
little
for
not
shape
their
life
more
,
and
do
well
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
fond
of
do
as
I
like
,
but
<EOS>
I
have
almost
give
it
up

she
end
,
smile
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
give
up
do

I
like

I

very
seldom

it

say
Will

<EOS>
He
be
stand
two
yard
from
her
with
his
mind
full
of
contradictory
desire
and
resolve
 
desire
some
unmistakable
proof
that
she
love
him
,
and
yet
dread
the
position
into
which
such
a
proof
may
bring
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
thing
one
most
long
for

be
surround
with
condition
that
would
be
intolerable

"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Pratt
enter
and

,
"
Sir
James
Chettam
be
in
the
library

madam

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ask
Sir
James
to
come
in
here
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
the
same
electric
shock
have
pass
through
her
and
Will
.
 
<EOS>
each
of
them
feel
proudly
resistant
,
and
neither
look
at
the
other
,
while
they
await
Sir
James
's
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
after
shake
hand
with
Dorothea
,
he
bow
as
slightly
as
possible
to
Ladislaw
,
who
repay
the
slightness
exactly
,
and
then
go
towards
Dorothea
,
say
    
"
I
must
say
good
-
by
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
;
and
probably
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
put
out
her
hand
and
say
her
good
-
by
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
the
sense
that
Sir
James
be
depreciate
Will
,
and
behave
rudely
to
him
,
rouse
her
resolution
and
dignity
:
there
be
no
touch
of
confusion
in
her
manner
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
Will
have
leave
the
room
,
she
look
with
such
calm
self
-
possession
at
Sir
James
,
say
,
"
how
be
Celia
?
"
<EOS>
that
he
be
oblige
to
behave
as
if
nothing
have
annoy
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
would
be
the
use
of
behave
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Sir
James
shrink
with
so
much
dislike
from
the
association
even
in
thought
of
Dorothea
with
Ladislaw
as
her
possible
lover
,
that
he
would
himself
have
wish
to
avoid
an
outward
show
of
displeasure
which
would
have
recognize
the
disagreeable
possibility
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
one
have
ask
him
why
he
shrink
in
that
way
,
I
be
not
sure
that
he
would
at
first
have
say
anything
full
or
more
precise
than
"
_
<EOS>
that
_
Ladislaw
!
"
 
<EOS>
though
on
reflection
he
may
have
urge
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
codicil
,
bar
Dorothea
's
marriage
with
Will
,
except
under
a
penalty
,
be
enough
to
cast
unfitness
over
any
relation
at
all
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
aversion
be
all
the
strong
because
he
feel
himself
unable
to
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sir
James
be
a
power
in
a
way
unguessed
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
enter
at
that
moment
,
he
be
an
incorporation
of
the
strong
reason
through
which
Will
's
pride
become
a
repellent
force
,
keep
him
asunder
from
Dorothea
.
        
<EOS>
Hath
<EOS>
she
her
fault
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
you
have
them
too
.
    
<EOS>
They
be
the
fruity
<EOS>
must
of
soundest
wine
;
    
or
say
,
they
be
regenerate
fire
    
<EOS>
such
as
hath
turn
the
dense
black
element
    
into
a
crystal
pathway
for
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
if
youth
be
the
season
of
hope
,
it
be
often
so
only
in
the
sense
that
our
elder
be
hopeful
about
us
;
for
no
age
be
so
apt
as
youth
to
think
its
emotion
,
parting
,
and
resolve
be
the
last
of
their
kind
.
 
<EOS>
each
crisis
seem
final
,
simply
because
it
be
new
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
tell
that
the
old
inhabitant
in
Peru
do
not
cease
to
be
agitate
by
the
earthquake
,
but
they
probably
see
beyond
each
shock
,
and
reflect
that
there
be
plenty
more
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
to
Dorothea
,
still
in
that
time
of
youth
when
the
eye
with
their
long
full
lash
look
out
after
their
rain
of
tear
unsoiled
and
unwearied
as
a
freshly
open
passion
-
flower
,
that
morning
's
parting
with
Will
Ladislaw
seem
to
be
the
close
of
their
personal
relation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
away
into
the
distance
of
unknown
year
,
and
if
ever
he
come
back
he
would
be
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
actual
state
of
his
mind
 
<EOS>
his
proud
resolve
to
give
the
lie
beforehand
to
any
suspicion
that
he
would
play
the
needy
adventurer
seek
a
rich
woman
 
lie
quite
out
of
her
imagination
,
and
she
have
interpret
all
his
behavior
easily
enough
by
her
supposition
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
codicil
seem
to
him
,
as
it
do
to
her
,
a
gross
and
cruel
interdict
on
any
active
friendship
between
them
.
<EOS>
Their
young
delight
in
speak
to
each
other
,
and
say
what
no
one
else
would
care
to
hear
,
be
forever
end
,
and
become
a
treasure
of
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
very
reason
she
dwell
on
it
without
inward
check
.
<EOS>
that
unique
happiness
too
be
dead
,
and
in
its
shadow
silent
chamber
she
may
vent
the
passionate
grief
which
she
herself
wonder
at
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
she
take
down
the
miniature
from
the
wall
and
keep
it
before
her
,
like
to
blend
the
woman
who
have
be
too
hardly
judge
with
the
grandson
whom
her
own
heart
and
judgment
defend
.
 
<EOS>
Can
any
one
who
have
rejoice
in
woman
's
tenderness
think
it
a
reproach
to
her
that
she
take
the
little
oval
picture
in
her
palm
and
make
a
bed
for
it
there
,
and
lean
her
cheek
upon
it
,
as
if
that
would
soothe
the
creature
who
have
suffer
unjust
condemnation
?
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
then
that
it
be
love
who
have
come
to
her
briefly
,
as
in
a
dream
before
awake
,
with
the
hue
of
morning
on
his
wing
 
that
it
be
love
to
whom
she
be
sob
her
farewell
as
his
image
be
banish
by
the
blameless
rigor
of
irresistible
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
feel
that
there
be
something
irrevocably
amiss
and
lose
in
her
lot
,
and
her
thought
about
the
future
be
the
more
readily
shapen
into
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
Ardent
soul
,
ready
to
construct
their
coming
life
,
be
apt
to
commit
themselves
to
the
fulfilment
of
their
own
vision
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
that
she
go
to
Freshitt
to
fulfil
her
promise
of
stay
all
night
and
see
baby
wash
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
come
to
dine
,
the
rector
be
go
on
a
fishing
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
warm
evening
,
and
even
in
the
delightful
drawing
-
room
,
where
the
fine
old
turf
slope
from
the
open
window
towards
a
lilied
pool
and
well

plant
mound
,
the
heat
be
enough
to
make
Celia

her
white
muslin
and
light
curl
reflect
with
pity
on
what
Dodo
must
feel
in
her
black
dress
and
close
cap

<EOS>
but
this
be
not
until
some
episode
with
baby
be
over
,
and
have
leave
her
mind
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
seat
herself
and
take
up
a
fan
for
some
time
before
she
say
,
in
her
quiet
guttural
    
"
Dear
Dodo
,
do
throw
off
that
cap

<EOS>
I
be
sure
your

make

ill

<EOS>
"
I

so
used

it

smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
rather
bare

expose
when

off

<EOS>
"
I
must
see
you
without

it

say
Celia

down
her
fan
,
and
go
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
picture
to
see
this
little
lady
in
white
muslin
unfasten
the
widow
's
cap
from
her
more
majestic
sister
,
and
toss
it
on
to
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
the
coil

braid
of
dark

brown
hair
have
be
set
free

Sir

He

<EOS>
"
no

there

He

regard
such

preposterous

especially
in

the
practice

be
to
treat

certain

probably
near

smile
with
meaning

Dorothea

have
begin
on

hearing
that
he
approve
of
her

have
grow
fast
during

stay
at

Sir

have
induce

to
take
ride
over

who
quite
return

and
tell
his

that
Mrs.

have
a
head
for
business
most
uncommon
in
a

<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that

Caleb
never

the
skilful

She

thing
I

"
Mr.

,
I
should
like
to
feel

old

that
I
have
improve
a
great
piece
of
land
and
build
a
great
many
good
cottage
,
because
the
work
be
of
a
healthy
kind
while

be

do
,
and
after
it

do
,
man
be
the
well
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
those
be
the
very
word
:
she
see
into
thing
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
womanly
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Mrs.
Garth
,
half
suspect
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
may
not
hold
the
true
principle
of
subordination
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
can
not
think
!
"
say
Caleb
,
shake
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
to
hear
her
speak
,
Susan
.
 
<EOS>
She
speak
in
such
plain
word
,
and
a
voice
like
music
.
 
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
it
remind
me
of
bit
in
the
"
Messiah
"
 
"
and
straightway
there
appear
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
,
praise
God
and
say
;
"
it
have
a
tone
with
it
that
satisfy
your
ear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Caleb
be
very
fond
of
music
,
and
when
he
could
afford
it
go
to
hear
an
oratorio
that
come
within
his
reach
,
return
from
it
with
a
profound
reverence
for
this
mighty
structure
of
tone
,
which
make
him
sit
meditatively
,
look
on
the
floor
and
throw
much
unutterable
language
into
his
outstretched
hand
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
good
understanding
between
them
,
it
be
natural
that
Dorothea
ask
Mr.
Garth
to
undertake
any
business
connect
with
the
three
farm
and
the
numerous
tenement
attach
to
Lowick
Manor
;
indeed
,
his
expectation
of
get
work
for
two
be
be
fast
fulfil
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
say
,
"
business
breed
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
one
form
of
business
which
be
begin
to
breed
just
then
be
the
construction
of
railway
.
 
<EOS>
a
project
line
be
to
run
through
Lowick
parish
where
the
cattle
have
hitherto
graze
in
a
peace
unbroken
by
astonishment
;
and
thus
it
happen
that
the
infant
struggle
of
the
railway
system
enter
into
the
affair
of
Caleb
Garth
,
and
determine
the
course
of
this
history
with
regard
to
two
person
who
be
dear
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
submarine
railway
may
have
its
difficulty
;
but
the
bed
of
the
sea
be
not
divide
among
various
landed
proprietor
with
claim
for
damage
not
only
measurable
but
sentimental
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
hundred
to
which
Middlemarch
belong
railway
be
as
exciting
a
topic
as
the
Reform
Bill
or
the
imminent
horror
of
Cholera
,
and
those
who
hold
the
most
decided
view
on
the
subject
be
woman
and
landholder
.
 
<EOS>
woman
both
old
and
young
regard
travel
by
steam
as
presumptuous
and
dangerous
,
and
argue
against
it
by
say
that
nothing
should
induce
them
to
get
into
a
railway
carriage
;
while
proprietor
,
differ
from
each
other
in
their
argument
as
much
as
Mr.
Solomon
Featherstone
differ
from
Lord
Medlicote
,
be
yet
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
in
sell
land
,
whether
to
the
Enemy
of
mankind
or
to
a
company
oblige
to
purchase
,
these
pernicious
agency
must
be
make
to
pay
a
very
high
price
to
landowner
for
permission
to
injure
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
slow
wit
,
such
as
Mr.
Solomon
and
Mrs.
Waule
,
who
both
occupy
land
of
their
own
,
take
a
long
time
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion
,
their
mind
halt
at
the
vivid
conception
of
what
it
would
be
to
cut
the
Big
Pasture
in
two
,
and
turn
it
into
three
-
corner
bit
,
which
would
be
"
nohow
;
"
while
accommodation
-
bridge
and
high
payment
be
remote
and
incredible
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
cow
will
all
cast
their
calf
,
brother
,
"
say
Mrs.
Waule
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
melancholy
,
"
if
the
railway
come
across
the
Near
Close
;
and
I
should
not
wonder
at
the
mare
too
,
if
she
be
in
foal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
poor
tale
if
a
widow
's
property
be
to
be
spade
away
,
and
the
law
say
nothing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
hinder
'em
from
cut
right
and
leave
if
they
begin
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
can
not
fight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
way
would
be
to
say
nothing
,
and
set
somebody
on
to
send
'em
away
with
a
flea
in
their
ear
,
when
they
come
spy
and
measure
,
"
say
Solomon
.
 
<EOS>
"
folk
do
that
about
Brassing
,
by
what
I
can
understand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
a
pretence
,
if
the
truth
be
know
,
about
their
be
force
to
take
one
way
.
 
<EOS>
let
'em
go
cut
in
another
parish
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
believe
in
any
pay
to
make
amend
for
bring
a
lot
of
ruffian
to
trample
your
crop
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
a
company
's
pocket
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Brother
Peter
,
God
forgive
him
,
get
money
out
of
a
company
,
"
say
Mrs.
Waule
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
that
be
for
the
manganese
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
for
railway
to
blow
you
to
piece
right
and
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
there
be
this
to
be
say
,
Jane
,
"
Mr.
Solomon
conclude
,
lower
his
voice
in
a
cautious
manner
 
"
the
more
spoke
we
put
in
their
wheel
,
the
more
they
will
pay
us
to
let
'em
go
on
,
if
they
must
come
whether
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
reasoning
of
Mr.
Solomon
's
be
perhaps
less
thorough
than
he
imagine
,
his
cunning
bearing
about
the
same
relation
to
the
course
of
railway
as
the
cunning
of
a
diplomatist
bear
to
the
general
chill
or
catarrh
of
the
solar
system
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
set
about
act
on
his
view
in
a
thoroughly
diplomatic
manner
,
by
stimulate
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
His
side
of
Lowick
be
the
most
remote
from
the
village
,
and
the
house
of
the
labor
people
be
either
lone
cottage
or
be
collect
in
a
hamlet
call
Frick
,
where
a
water
-
mill
and
some
stone
-
pit
make
a
little
centre
of
slow
,
heavy
-
shoulder
industry
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
any
precise
idea
as
to
what
railway
be
,
public
opinion
in
Frick
be
against
them
;
for
the
human
mind
in
that
grassy
corner
have
not
the
proverbial
tendency
to
admire
the
unknown
,
hold
rather
that
it
be
likely
to
be
against
the
poor
man
,
and
that
suspicion
be
the
only
wise
attitude
with
regard
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
rumor
of
Reform
have
not
yet
excite
any
millennial
expectation
in
Frick
,
there
be
no
definite
promise
in
it
,
as
of
gratuitous
grain
to
fatten
Hiram
Ford
's
pig
,
or
of
a
publican
at
the
"
Weights
and
Scales
"
who
would
brew
beer
for
nothing
,
or
of
an
offer
on
the
part
of
the
three
neighboring
farmer
to
raise
wage
during
winter
.
 
<EOS>
and
without
distinct
good
of
this
kind
in
its
promise
,
reform
seem
on
a
footing
with
the
bragging
of
pedler
,
which
be
a
hint
for
distrust
to
every
know
person
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
of
Frick
be
not
ill
-
fed
,
and
be
less
give
to
fanaticism
than
to
a
strong
muscular
suspicion
;
less
inclined
to
believe
that
they
be
peculiarly
care
for
by
heaven
,
than
to
regard
heaven
itself
as
rather
disposed
to
take
them
in
 
a
disposition
observable
in
the
weather
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
mind
of
Frick
be
exactly
of
the
sort
for
Mr.
Solomon
Featherstone
to
work
upon
,
he
have
more
plenteous
idea
of
the
same
order
,
with
a
suspicion
of
heaven
and
earth
which
be
better
feed
and
more
entirely
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
be
overseer
of
the
road
at
that
time
,
and
on
his
slow
-
pace
cob
often
take
his
round
by
Frick
to
look
at
the
workman
get
the
stone
there
,
pause
with
a
mysterious
deliberation
,
which
may
have
mislead
you
into
supposing
that
he
have
some
other
reason
for
stay
than
the
mere
want
of
impulse
to
move
.
<EOS>
after
look
for
a
long
while
at
any
work
that
be
go
on
,
he
would
raise
his
eye
a
little
and
look
at
the
horizon
;
finally
he
would
shake
his
bridle
,
touch
his
horse
with
the
whip
,
and
get
it
to
move
slowly
onward
.
 
<EOS>
the
hour
-
hand
of
a
clock
be
quick
by
comparison
with
Mr.
Solomon
,
who
have
an
agreeable
sense
that
he
could
afford
to
be
slow
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
habit
of
pause
for
a
cautious
,
vaguely
design
chat
with
every
hedger
or
ditcher
on
his
way
,
and
be
especially
willing
to
listen
even
to
news
which
he
have
hear
before
,
feel
himself
at
an
advantage
over
all
narrator
in
partially
disbelieve
them
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
however
,
he
get
into
a
dialogue
with
Hiram
Ford
,
a
wagoner
,
in
which
he
himself
contribute
information
.
 
<EOS>
He
wish
to
know
whether
Hiram
have
see
fellow
with
stave
and
instrument
spy
about
:
they
call
themselves
railroad
people
,
but
there
be
no
tell
what
they
be
or
what
they
mean
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
least
they
pretend
be
that
they
be
go
to
cut
Lowick
Parish
into
six
and
seven
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
there
will
be
no
stirrin
'
from
one
pla

ace
to
another
,
"
say
Hiram
,
think
of
his
wagon

horse

<EOS>
"
not
a

Mr.
Solomon

up
fine

I.

<EOS>
"
why

say
Hiram

who
have
a
dim
notion
of
London
as

centre
of
hostility
to
the
country

I

Yoddrell
's
,
and
in
walk
with
his
assistant
and
measuring
-
chain
to
the
scene
of
his
work
,
he
encounter
the
party
of
the
company
's
agent
,
who
be
adjust
their
spirit
-
level
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
chat
he
leave
them
,

that

<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
gray
morning
after
light
rain
,
which
become
delicious
about
twelve
o'clock
,
when
the
cloud
part
a
little
,
and
the
scent
of
the
earth
be
sweet
along
the
lane
and
by
the
hedgerow
.
  
<EOS>
the
scent
would
have
be
sweet
to
Fred
Vincy
,
who
be
come
along
the
lane
on
horseback
,
if
his
mind
have
not
be
worry
by
unsuccessful
effort
to
imagine
what
he
be
to
do
,
with
his
father
on
one
side
expect
him
straightway
to
enter
the
Church
,
with
Mary
on
the
other
threaten
to
forsake
him
if
he
do
enter
it
,
and
with
the
work
-
day
world
show
no
eager
need
whatever
of
a
young
gentleman
without
capital
and
generally
unskilled
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
hard
to
Fred
's
disposition
because
his
father
,
satisfy
that
he
be
no
longer
rebellious
<EOS>
,
be
in
good
humor
with
him
,
and
have
send
him
on
this
pleasant
ride
to
see
after
some
greyhound
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
he
have
fix
on
what
he
should
do
,
there
would
be
the
task
of
tell
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
admit
that
the
fixing
,
which
have
to
come
first
,
be
the
more
difficult
task
:
 
what
secular
avocation
on
earth
be
there
for
a
young
man
(
whose
friend
could
not
get
him
an
"
appointment
"
)
which
be
at
once
gentlemanly
,
lucrative
,
and
to
be
follow
without
special
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
ride
along
the
lane
by
Frick
in
this
mood
,
and
slacken
his
pace
while
he
reflect
whether
he
should
venture
to
go
round
by
Lowick
Parsonage
to
call
on
Mary
,
he
could
see
over
the
hedge
from
one
field
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
a
noise
rouse
his
attention
,
and
on
the
far
side
of
a
field
on
his
left
hand
he
could
see
six
or
seven
man
in
smock

with

fork
in
their
hand
make
an
offensive
approach
towards
the

charge
them
suddenly
enough
to
throw

"

the
fear

the
fear
of
have
to
speechify
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
feel
it
<EOS>
his
duty
at
this
moment
to
try
and
give
a
little
harangue
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
striking
mixture
in
him
 
which
come
from
his
have
always
be
a
hard
-
working
man
himself
 
of
rigorous
notion
about
workman
and
practical
indulgence
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
to
do
a
good
day

work
and
to
do
it
well
,
he
hold
to
be
part
of
their
welfare
,
as
it
be
the
chief
part
of
his
own
happiness
;
but
he
have
a
strong
sense
of
fellowship
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
advance
towards
the
laborer
they
have
not
go
to
work
again
,
but
be
stand
in
that
form
of
rural
grouping
which
consist
in
each
turn
a
shoulder
towards
the
other
,
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
yard

<EOS>
They
look
rather
sulkily
at
Caleb

who
walk
quickly
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
and
the

thrust
between
the
button
of
his

and
have
his
every

mild
air
when

pause
among
them

"
why

my

how
be
this
?
<EOS>
"
he
begin
,
take
as
usual
to
brief
phrase
,
which
seem
pregnant
to
himself
,
because
he
have
many
thought
lie
under
them
,
like
the
abundant
root
of
a
plant
that
just
manage
to
peep
above
the
water

now

you

for

<EOS>
Mr.

would
take
no
important
step

it
must
be
confess
that
before
he
reach
home
he
have
take
his
resolution

<EOS>
with
regard
to
a
large
number

he

He

he
would
have
say

"
let
us
go

without
inquire
into
detail

but
where
Caleb
's
feeling

judgment
strongly
pronounce

he
be
a
ruler
;

in

his
mildness
and
timidity
in
reproving

every
one
about
him
know
that
on
the
exceptional
occasion

he
be
absolute

He
never

choose

on

Mrs.

it
seem

everything
as
light

can
be
to
Mary
,
poor
child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Caleb
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
look
with
anxious
appeal
towards
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
rise
and
kiss
him
,
say
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Caleb
!
 
<EOS>
Our
child
have
a
good
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
she
go
out
and
have
a
hearty
cry
to
make
up
for
the
suppression
of
her
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
sure
that
her
husband
's
conduct
would
be
misunderstood
,
and
about
Fred
<EOS>
she
be
rational
and
unhopeful
.
 
<EOS>
which
would
turn
out
to
have
the
more
foresight
in
it
 
her
rationality
or
Caleb
's
ardent
generosity
?
  
<EOS>
when
Fred
go
to
the
office
the
next
morning
,
there
be
a
test
to
be
go
through
which
he
be
not
prepare
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
Fred
,
"
say
Caleb
,
"
you
will
have
some
desk
-
work
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
do
a
good
deal
of
write
myself
,
but
I
can
not
do
without
help
,
and
as
I
want
you
to
understand
the
account
and
get
the
value
into
your
head
,
<EOS>
I
mean
to
do
without
another
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
must
buckle
to
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
you
at
writing
and
arithmetic
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
feel
an
awkward
movement
of
the
heart
;
he
have
not
think
of
desk
-
work
;
but
he
be
in
a
resolute
mood
,
and
not
go
to
shrink
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afraid
of
arithmetic
,
Mr.
Garth
:
it
always
come
easily
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
know
my
writing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
see
,
"
say
Caleb
,
take
up
a
pen
,
examine
it
carefully
and
hand
it
,
well
dip
,
to
Fred
with
a
sheet
of
rule
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
copy
me
a
line
or
two
of
that
valuation
,
with
the
figure
at
the
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
time
the
opinion
exist
that
it
be
beneath
a
gentleman
to
write
legibly
,
or
with
a
hand
in
the
least
suitable
to
a
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
write
the
line
demand
in
a
hand
as
gentlemanly
as
that
of
any
viscount
or
bishop
of
the
day
:
the
vowel
be
all
alike
and
the
consonant
only
distinguishable
as
turn
up
or
down
,
the
stroke
have
a
blotted
solidity
and
the
letter
disdain
to
keep
the
line
 
in
short
,
it
be
a
manuscript
of
that
venerable
kind
easy
to
interpret
when
you
know
beforehand
what
the
writer
mean
.
  
<EOS>
as
Caleb
look
on
,
his
visage
show
a
grow
depression
,
but
when
Fred
hand
him
the
paper
he
give
something
like
a
snarl
,
and
rap
the
paper
passionately
with
the
back
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
bad
work
like
this
dispel
all
Caleb
's
mildness
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
deuce
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
snarlingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
think
that
this
be
a
country
where
a
man
's
education
may
cost
hundred
and
hundred
,
and
it
turn
you
out
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
in
a
more
pathetic
tone
,
push
up
his
spectacle
and
look
at
the
unfortunate
scribe
,
"
the
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
,
Fred
,
I
can
not
put
up
with
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
I
do
,
Mr.
Garth
?
"
say
Fred
,
whose
spirit
have
sink
very
low
,
not
only
at
the
estimate
of
his
handwriting
,
but
at
the
vision
of
himself
as
liable
to
be
rank
with
office
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
must
learn
to
form
your
letter
and
keep
the
line
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
writing
at
all
if
nobody
can
understand
it
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Caleb
,
energetically
,
quite
preoccupied
with
the
bad
quality
of
the
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
there
so
little
business
in
the
world
that
you
must
be
send
puzzle
over
the
country

<EOS>
but
that
be
the
way
people
be
bring
up

<EOS>
I
should
lose
no
end
of
time
with
the
letter
some
people
send
me
,
if
Susan
do
not
make
them
out
for
me

<EOS>
It
be
disgusting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Caleb
toss
the
paper
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
any
stranger
peep
into
the
office
at
that
moment
may
have
wonder
what
be
the
drama
between
the
indignant
man
of
business
,
and
the
fine
-
look
young
fellow
whose
blond
complexion
be
get
rather
patchy
as
he
bite
his
lip
with
mortification
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
be
struggle
with
many
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Garth
have
be
so
kind
and
encouraging
at
the
beginning
of
their
interview
,
that
gratitude
and
hopefulness
have
be
at
a
high
pitch
,
and
the
downfall
be
proportionate
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
think
of
desk
-
work
 
in
fact
,
like
the
majority
of
young
gentleman
,
he
want
an
occupation
which
should
be
free
from
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
may
have
be
the
consequence
if
he
have
not
distinctly
promise
himself
that
he
would
go
to
Lowick
to
see
Mary
and
tell
her
that
he
be
engage
to
work
under
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
disappoint
himself
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
"
be
all
the
word
that
he
could
muster
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Garth
be
already
relent
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
the
good
of
it
,
Fred
,
"
he
begin
,
with
a
return
to
his
usual
quiet
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
every
man
can
learn
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
teach
myself
.
 
<EOS>
go
at
it
with
a
will
,
and
sit
up
at
night
if
the
day
-
time
be
not
enough
.
<EOS>
We
will
be
patient
,
my
boy

<EOS>
Callum
shall
go
on
with
the
book
for
a
bit
,
while
you
be
learn
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
must
be
off
,
"
say
Caleb
,
rise
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
let
your
father
know
our
agreement

<EOS>
You
will
save
me
Callum
's
salary
,
you
know
,
when
you
can
write
;
and
I
can
afford
to
give
you
eighty
pound
for
the
first
year
,
and
more
after
.

"
  
<EOS>
when
Fred
make
the
necessary
disclosure
to
his
parent
,
the
relative
effect
on
the
two
be
a
surprise
which
enter
very
deeply
into
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
straight
from
Mr.
Garth
's
office
to
the
warehouse
,
rightly
feel
that
the
most
respectful
way
in
which
he
could
behave
to
his
father
be
to
make
the
painful
communication
as
gravely
and
formally
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
decision
would
be
more
certainly
understand
to
be
final
,
if
the
interview
take
place
in
his
father
's
gravest
hour
,
which
be
always
those
spend
in
his
private
room
at
the
warehouse
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
enter
on
the
subject
directly
,
and
declare
briefly
what
he
have
do
and
be
resolve
to
do
,
express
at
the
end
his
regret
that
he
should
be
the
cause
of
disappointment
to
his
father
,
and
take
the
blame
on
his
own
deficiency
.
 
<EOS>
the
regret
be
genuine
,
and
inspire
Fred
with
strong
,
simple
word
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
listen
in
profound
surprise
without
utter
even
an
exclamation
,
a
silence
which
in
his
impatient
temperament
be
a
sign
of
unusual
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
in
good
spirit
about
trade
that
morning
,
and
the
slight
bitterness
in
his
lip
grow
intense
as
he
listen
.
 
<EOS>
when
Fred
have
end
,
there
be
a
pause
of
nearly
a
minute
,
during
which
Mr.
Vincy
replace
a
book
in
his
desk
and
turn
the
key
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
look
at
his
son
steadily
,
and
say
    
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
make
up
your
mind
at
last
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
stick
to
it

<EOS>
I
have
no
more
to
say

<EOS>
You
have
throw
away
your
education
,
and
go
down
a
step
in
life
,
when
I
have
give
you
the
mean
of
rise

that
be
all

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
that
we
differ
,
father

<EOS>
I
think
I
can
be
quite
as
much
of
a
gentleman
at
the
work
I
have
undertake
,
as
if
I
have
be
a
curate
.
 
<EOS>

I
be
grateful
to
you
for
wish

do
the
good
for

very
well

no
more
to

<EOS>
I
wash
my
hand

<EOS>
I
only
hope
,
when
you
have
a
son
of
your
own
he
will
make
a
well
return
for
the
pain
you
spend
on
him

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
cut
to
Fred
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
be
use
that
unfair
advantage
possess
by
us
all
when
we
be
in
a
pathetic
situation
and
see
our
own
past
as
if
it
be
simply
part
of
the
pathos
.
 
<EOS>
in
reality
,
Mr.
Vincy
's
wish
about
his
son
have
have
a
great
deal
of
pride
,
inconsiderateness
,
and
egoistic
folly
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
the
disappointed
father
hold
a
strong
lever
;
and
Fred
feel
as
if
he
be
be
banish
with
a
malediction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
object
to
my
remain
at
home
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
after
rise
to
go
;
"
I
shall
have
a
sufficient
salary
to
pay
for
my
board

as
of
course
I
should
wish
to
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
board
be
hang
!
"
say
Mr.
Vincy
,
recover
himself
in
his
disgust
at
the
notion
that
Fred
's
keep
would
be
miss
at
his
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
your
mother
will
want
you
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
keep
no
horse
for
you
,
you
understand
;
and
you
will
pay
your
own
tailor
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
do
with
a
suit
or
two
less
,
I
fancy
,
when
you
have
to
pay
for

"
  
<EOS>
Fred
linger
;
there
be
still
something
to
be
say
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
it
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
shake
hand
with
me
,
father
,
and
forgive
me
the
vexation
I
have
cause
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vincy
from
his
chair
throw
a
quick
glance
upward
at
his
son
,
who
have
advance
near
to
him
,
and
then
give
his
hand
,
say
hurriedly
,
"
yes
,
yes
,
let
us
say
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
go
through
much
more
narrative
and
explanation
with
his
mother
,
but
she
be
inconsolable
,
have
before
her
eye
what
perhaps
her
husband
have
never
think
of
,
the
certainty
that
Fred
would
marry
Mary
Garth
,
that
her
life
would
henceforth
be
spoil
by
a
perpetual
infusion
of
garth
and
their
way
,
and
that
her
darling
boy
,
with
his
beautiful
face
and
stylish
air
"
beyond
anybody
else
's
son
in
Middlemarch
,
"
would
be
sure
to
get
like
that
family
in
plainness
of
appearance
and
carelessness
about
his
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
to
her
it
seem
that
there
be
a
Garth
conspiracy
to
get
possession
of
the
desirable
Fred
,
but
she
dare
not
enlarge
on
this
opinion
,
because
a
slight
hint
of
it
have
make
him
"
fly
out
"
at
her
as
he
have
never
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
Her
temper
be
too
sweet
for
her
to
show
any
anger
,
but
she
feel
that
her
happiness
have
receive
a
bruise
,
and
for
several
day
merely
to
look
at
Fred
make
her
cry
a
little
as
if
he
be
the
subject
of
some
baleful
prophecy
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
be
the
slow
to
recover
her
usual
cheerfulness
because
Fred
have
warn
her
that
she
must
not
reopen
the
sore
question
with
his
father
,
who
have
accept
his
decision
and
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
her
husband
have
be
vehement
against
Fred
,
she
would
have
be
urge
into
defence
of
her
darling
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
when
Mr.
Vincy
say
to
her
    
"
come

Mrs.

rouse
by
this
appeal
and
adjust
herself
with
a
little
shake
as

It

Fred

that
Mrs.

wish
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
say
anything
he
have

he
could
only
begin
by
observe
    
"
how
glad
you
must
be

have
Christy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

yes

He
get
down

just

He

carry
on

He

no

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after

he
add
,

I
fear
you
will
think

ask
them
to
do

answer
Mrs.
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
knit
,
and
could
either
look
at
Fred
or
not
,
as
she
choose
 
always
an
advantage
when
one
be
bent
on
load
speech
with
salutary
meaning
;
and
though
Mrs.
Garth
intend
to
be
duly
reserve
,
she
do
wish
to
say
something
that
Fred
may
be
the
well
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
think
me
very
undeserving

Mrs.
Garth
,
and
with
good
reason
,
"
say
Fred
,
his
spirit
rise
a
little
at
the
perception
of
something
like
a
disposition
to
lecture
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
have
behave
just
the
bad
to
the
people
I
can
not
help
wish
for
the
most
from
.
<EOS>
but
while
two
man
like
Mr.
Garth
and
Mr.
Farebrother
have
not
give
me
up
,
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
give
myself
up

"
 
<EOS>
Fred
think
it
may
be
well
to
suggest
these
masculine
example
to
Mrs.
Garth
.
  
<EOS>
"
assuredly
,
"

she
,
with
gather
emphasis

<EOS>
"
a
young
man
for
whom
two
such
elder
have
devote
themselves
would
indeed
be
culpable

he
throw
himself
away
and
make
their
sacrifice
vain

"
  
<EOS>
Fred
wonder
a
little
at
this
strong
language
,
but
only
say
,
"
I
hope
it
will
not
be
so
with
me
,
Mrs.
Garth
,
since
I
have
some
encouragement
to
believe
that
I
may
win
Mary

<EOS>
Mr.
Garth
have
tell
you
about
that
?
<EOS>
You
be
not
surprised

I
dare
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
Fred
end
,
innocently
refer
only
to
his
own
love
as
probably
evident
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
surprised
that
Mary
have
give
you
encouragement
?
"
return
Mrs.
Garth
,
who
think
it
would
be
well
for
Fred
to
be
more
alive
to
the
fact
that
Mary
's
friend
could
not
possibly
have
wish
this
beforehand
,
whatever
the
Vincys
may
suppose

<EOS>
"
yes

I
confess
I
be
surprised

<EOS>
"
She
never

give
me
any
 
not
the
least
in

world
,
when
I
talk
to
her
myself
,
"
say
Fred
,
eager
to
vindicate
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
when
I
ask
Mr.
Farebrother
to
speak
for
me
,
she
allow
him
to
tell
me
there
be
a
hope
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
power
of
admonition
which
have
begin
to
stir
in
Mrs.
Garth
have
not
yet
discharge
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
too
provoking
even
for
_
her
_
self
-
control
that
this
blooming
youngster
should
flourish
on
the
disappointment
of
sadder
and
wise
people
 
make
a
meal
of
a
nightingale
and
never
know
it
 
and
that
all
the
while
his
family
should
suppose
that
her
be
in
eager
need
of
this
sprig
;
and
her
vexation
have
ferment
the
more
actively
because
of
its
total
repression
towards
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
exemplary
wife
will
sometimes
find
scapegoat
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
say
with
energetic
decision
,
"
You
make
a
great
mistake
,
Fred
,
in
ask
Mr.
Farebrother
to
speak
for
you

"
do
I

Fred

redden
instantaneously

<EOS>
He
be
alarm
,
but
at
a
loss
to
know
what
Mrs.
Garth
mean
,
and
add
,
in
an
apologetic
tone
,
"
Mr.
Farebrother
have
always
be
such
a
friend
of
ours
;
and
Mary
,
I
know
,
would
listen
to
him
gravely
;

he
take
it
on
himself
quite
readily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

young
people
be
usually
blind

everything

their

how

say
Mrs.

.
<EOS>
She
do
not
mean
to
go
beyond
this
salutary
general
doctrine
,
and
throw
her
indignation
into
a
needless
unwinding
of
her
worst
,
knit
her
brow
at
it
with
a
grand
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
how
it
could
be
any
pain
to
Mr.

Fred

who
nevertheless
feel
that
surprising
conception
be
begin
to
form
themselves

<EOS>
"
precisely
;
you
can

Mrs.

cut
her
word
as
neatly

possible

<EOS>
for
a
moment
Fred
look
at
the
horizon
with
a
dismayed
anxiety
,
and
then
turn
with
a
quick
movement
say
almost
sharply
    
"
do
you
mean
to
say
,
Mrs.

that
Mr.

be
in
love

ought

return
Mrs.
Garth
,
lay
her
knit
down
beside
her
and
fold
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
unwonted
sign
of
emotion
in
her
that
she
should
put
her
work
out
of
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
her
feeling
be
divide
between
the
satisfaction
of
give
Fred
his
discipline
and
the
sense
of
have
go
a
little
too
far
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
take
his
hat
and
stick
and
rise
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
think
I
be
stand
in
his
way

and
in
Mary
be
too

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
in
a
tone
which
seem
to
demand
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Garth
could
not
speak
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
bring
herself
into
the
unpleasant
position
of
be
call
on
to
say
what
she
really
feel

yet
<EOS>
what
she
know
there
be
strong
reason

and
to
her
the
consciousness

have
exceed
in

be
peculiarly
mortify

besides

Fred
have
give
out
unexpected
electricity

he
now
add
,
"
Mr.

pleased

He

<EOS>
Mrs.

feel
a
severe
twinge
at
this
mention

there

snatch
up
the
half

knit

fit
it
over

as
a

out

cruelty
 
<EOS>
it
be
a

as
full
of
sensation

Mrs.

be
oblige
to
interfere

come
up

a

<EOS>
He
get
away
as
soon
as
he
could
,
and
Mrs.
Garth
could
only
imply
some
retractation
of
her
severity
by
say
"
God
bless
you
"
when
she
shake
hand
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
unpleasantly
conscious
that
she
have
be
on
the
verge
of
speak
as
"
one
of
the
foolish
woman
speaketh
"
 
tell
first
and
entreat
silence
after

<EOS>
but
she
have
not
entreat
silence
,
and
to
prevent
Caleb
's
blame
she
determine
to
blame
herself
and
confess
all
to
him
that
very
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
what
an
awful
tribunal
the
mild
Caleb
's
be
to
her
,
whenever
he
set
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
mean
to
point
out
to
him
that
the
revelation
may
do
Fred
Vincy
a
great
deal
of
good
.
  
<EOS>
no
doubt
it
be
have
a
strong
effect
on
him
as
he
walk
to
Lowick

<EOS>
Fred

light
hopeful
nature
have
perhaps
never
have
so
much
of
a
bruise
as
from
this
suggestion
that
if

have
make

he
be
pique
that
he
have
be
what
he
call
such
a
stupid
lout
as
to
ask
that
intervention
from
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
a
lover
's
nature
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
in
Fred
's
,
that
the
new
anxiety
raise
about
Mary
's
feeling
<EOS>
should
not
surmount
every
other
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
trust
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
generosity
,
notwithstanding
what
Mary
have
say
to
him
,
Fred
could
not
help
feel
that
he
have
a
rival
:
it
be
a
new
consciousness
,
and
he
object
to
it
extremely
,
not
be
in
the
least
ready
to
give
up
Mary
for
her
good
,
be
ready
rather
to
fight
for
her
with
any
man
whatsoever
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fighting
with
Mr.
Farebrother
must
be
of
a
metaphorical
kind
,
which
be
much
more
difficult
to
Fred
than
the
muscular
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
this
experience
be
a
discipline
for
Fred
hardly
less
sharp
than
his
disappointment
about
his
uncle
's
will
.
 
<EOS>
the
iron
have
not
enter
into
his
soul
,
but
he
have
begin
to
imagine
what
the
sharp
edge
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
once
occur
to
Fred
that
Mrs.
Garth
may
be
mistake
about
Mr.
Farebrother
,
but
he
suspect
that
she
may
be
wrong
about
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
have
be
stay
at
the
parsonage
lately
,
and
her
mother
may
know
very
little
of
what
have
be
pass
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
feel
easy
when
he
find
her
look
cheerful
with
the
three
lady
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
animate
discussion
on
some
subject
which
be
drop
when
he
enter
,
and
Mary
be
copy
the
label
from
a
heap
of
shallow
cabinet
drawer
,
in
a
minute
handwriting
<EOS>
which
she
be
skilled
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
be
somewhere
in
the
village
,
and
the
three
lady
know
nothing
of
Fred
's
peculiar
relation
to
Mary
:
it
be
impossible
for
either
of
them
to
propose
that
they
should
walk
round
the
garden
,
and
Fred
predict
to
himself
that
he
should
have
to
go
away
without
say
a
word
to
her
in
private
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
her
first
of
Christy
's
arrival
and
then
of
his
own
engagement
with
her
father
;
and
he
be
comfort
by
see
that
this
latter
news
touch
her
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
hurriedly
,
"
I
be
so
glad
,
"
and
then
bend
over
her
writing
to
hinder
any
one
from
notice
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
be
a
subject
which
Mrs.
Farebrother
could
not
let
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
,
my
dear
Miss
Garth
,
that
you
be
glad
to
hear
of
a
young
man
give
up
the
Church
for
which
he
be
educate
:
you
only
mean
that
thing
be
so
,
you
be
glad
that
he
should
be
under
an
excellent
man
like
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
really
,
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
I
be
glad
of
both
,
I
fear
,
"
say
Mary
,
cleverly
get
rid
of
one
rebellious
tear
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
dreadfully
secular
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
like
any
clergyman
except
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
and
Mr.
Farebrother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
now
why
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
pause
on
her
large
wooden
knitting
-
needle
and
look
at
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
a
good
reason
for
your
opinion
,
but
this
astonish
me
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
put
out
of
the
question
those
who
preach
new
doctrine
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
should
you
dislike
clergyman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
"
say
Mary
,
her
face
break
into
merriment
as
she
seem
to
consider
a
moment
,
"
I
do
not
like
their
neckcloth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
do
not
like
Camden
's
,
then
,
"
say
Miss
Winifred
,
in
some
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
,
"
say
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
the
other
clergyman
's
neckcloth
,
because
it
be
they
who
wear
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
puzzling
!
"
say
Miss
Noble
,
feel
that
her
own
intellect
be
probably
deficient
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
be
joke
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
well
reason
than
these
for
slight
so
respectable
a
class
of
man
,
"
say
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
majestically
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Garth
have
such
severe
notion
of
what
people
should
be
that
it
be
difficult
to
satisfy
her
,
"
say
Fred
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
glad
at
least
that
she
make
an
exception
in
favor
of
my
son
,
"
say
the
old
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
wonder
at
Fred
's
piqued
tone
,
when
Mr.
Farebrother
come
in
and
have
to
hear
the
news
about
the
engagement
under
Mr.
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
he
say
with
quiet
satisfaction
,
"

<EOS>
that
_
be
right
;
"
and
then
bent
to
look
at
Mary
's
label
and
praise
her
handwriting
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
feel
horribly
jealous
 
<EOS>
be
glad
,
of
course
,
that
Mr.
Farebrother
be
so
estimable
,
but
wish
that
he
have
be
ugly
and
fat
as
man
at
forty
sometimes
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
what
the
end
would
be
,
since
Mary
openly
place
Farebrother
above
everybody
,
and
these
woman
be
all
evidently
encourage
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
be
feel
sure
that
he
should
have
no

speak
to
Mary

when
Mr.

I

<EOS>
Mary

the
Vicar

<EOS>
He
have
never
since
the
memorable
evening
deviate
from
his
old
pastoral
kindness
towards
her
,
and
her
momentary
wonder
and
doubt
have
quite
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
accustomed
to
think
rather
rigorously
of
what
be
probable
,
and
if
a
belief
flatter
her
vanity
<EOS>
she
feel
warn
to
dismiss
it
as
ridiculous

have
early
have
much
exercise
in
such
dismissal

It

admire
the
fitting
of

here
a

I

It

You

Farebrother
at

there

rage
in

<EOS>
Mary

indignantly

deep

in

really

unsuspicious

there
be
no

there

the
result

the
conversation

to

through
many
of

the
idea
that
we
could
accept
any
exchange
for
it
seem
to
be
a
cheapening
of

we
can
set
a
watch
over

over

Fred
have
lose
all
his

keep
this

to

curl
her

fleeting

an

these

guest
,
she
have
a
placid
sense
that
his
rank
penetrate
them
as
if
it
have
be
an
odor
.
 
<EOS>
the
satisfaction
be
enough
for
the
time
to
melt
away
some
disappointment
in
the
condition
of
marriage
with
a
medical
man
even
of
good
birth
:
it
seem
now
that
her
marriage
be
visibly
as
well
as
ideally
float
her
above
the
Middlemarch
level
,
and
the
future
look
bright
with
letter
and
visit
to
and
from
Quallingham
,
and
vague
advancement
in
consequence
for
Tertius
.
 
<EOS>
especially
as
,
probably
at
the
Captain
's
suggestion
,
his
marry
sister
,
Mrs.
Mengan
,
have
come
with
her
maid
,
and
stay
two
night
on
her
way
from
town
.
 
<EOS>
hence
it
be
clearly
worth
while
for
Rosamond
to
take
pain
with
her
music
and
the
careful
selection
of
her
lace
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Captain
Lydgate
himself
,
his
low
brow
,
his
aquiline
nose
bent
on
one
side
,
and
his
rather
heavy
utterance
,
may
have
be
disadvantageous
in
any
young
gentleman
who
have
not
a
military
bearing
and
mustache
to
give
him
what
be
dote
on
by
some
flower
-
like
blond
head
as
"
style
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
moreover
,
that
sort
of
high
-
breeding
which
consist
in
be
free
from
the
petty
solicitude
of
middle
-
class
gentility
,
and
he
be
a
great
critic
of
feminine
charm
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
delight
in
his
admiration
now
even
more
than
she
have
do
at
Quallingham
,
and
he
find
it
easy
to
spend
several
hour
of
the
day
in
flirting
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
visit
altogether
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
lark
he
have
ever
have
,
not
the
less
so
perhaps
because
he
suspect
that
his
queer
cousin
Tertius
wish
him
away
:
<EOS>
though
Lydgate
,
who
would
rather
(
hyperbolically
speak
)
have
die
than
have
fail
in
polite
hospitality
,
suppress
his
dislike
,
and
only
pretend
generally
not
to
hear
what
the
gallant
officer
say
,
consign
the
task
of
answer
him
to
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
not
at
all
a
jealous
husband
,
and
prefer
leave
a
feather
-
head
young
gentleman
alone
with
his
wife
to
bear
him
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
talk
more
to
the
Captain
at
dinner
,
Tertius
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
one
evening
when
the
important
guest
be
go
to
Loamford
to
see
some
brother
officer
station
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
look
so
absent
sometimes
 
you
seem
to
be
see
through
his
head
into
something
behind
it
,
instead
of
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
rosy
,
you
do
not
expect
me
to
talk
much
to
such
a
conceited
ass
as
that
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
brusquely
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
get
his
head
break
,
I
may
look
at
it
with
interest
,
not
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
why
you
should
speak
of
your
cousin
so
contemptuously
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
her
finger
move
at
her
work
while
she
speak
with
a
mild
gravity
which
have
a
touch
of
disdain
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
ask
Ladislaw
if
he
do
not
think
your
captain
the
great
bore
he
ever
meet
with
.
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
have
almost
forsake
the
house
since
he
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
think
she
know
perfectly
well
why
Mr.
Ladislaw
dislike
the
captain
:
he
be
jealous
,
and
she
like
his
be
jealous
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
say
what
will
suit
eccentric
person
,
"
she
answer
,
"
but
in
my
opinion
Captain
Lydgate
be
a
thorough
gentleman
,
and
I
think
you
ought
not
,
out
of
respect
to
Sir
Godwin
,
to
treat
him
with
neglect
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear
;
but
we
have
have
dinner
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
come
in
and
go
out
as
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
want
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
still
,
when
he
be
in
the
room
,
you
may
show
him
more
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
not
be
a
phoenix
of
cleverness
in
your
sense
;
his
profession
be
different
;
but
it
would
be
all
the
well
for
you
to
talk
a
little
on
his
subject
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
think
his
conversation
be
quite
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
anything
but
an
unprincipled
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
you
would
wish
me
to
be
a
little
more
like
him
,
Rosy
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
in
a
sort
of
resigned
murmur
,
with
a
smile
which
be
not
exactly
tender
,
and
certainly
not
merry
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
silent
and
do
not
smile
again
;
but
the
lovely
curve
of
her
face
look
good
-
temper
enough
without
smile
.
  
<EOS>
those
word
of
Lydgate
's
be
like
a
sad
milestone
mark
how
far
he
have
travel
from
his
old
dreamland
,
in
which
Rosamond
Vincy
appear
to
be
that
perfect
piece
of
womanhood
who
would
reverence
her
husband
's
mind
after
the
fashion
of
an
accomplished
mermaid
,
use
her
comb
and
looking
-
glass
and
singe
her
song
for
the
relaxation
of
his
adore
wisdom
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
distinguish
between
that
imagine
adoration
and
the
attraction
towards
a
man
's
talent
because
it
give
him
prestige
,
and
be
like
an
order
in
his
button
-
hole
or
an
honorable
before
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
suppose
that
Rosamond
have
travel
too
,
since
she
have
find
the
pointless
conversation
of
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
perfectly
wearisome
;
but
to
most
mortal
there
be
a
stupidity
which
be
unendurable
and
a
stupidity
which
be
altogether
acceptable
 
else
,
indeed
,
what
would
become
of
social
bond
?
 
<EOS>
Captain
Lydgate
's
stupidity
be
delicately
scent
,
carry
itself
with
"
style
,
"
<EOS>
talk
with
a
good
accent
,
and
be
closely
related
to
Sir
Godwin
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
find
it
quite
agreeable
and
catch
many
of
its
phrase
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
since
Rosamond
,
as
we
know
,
be
fond
of
horseback
,
there
be
plenty
of
reason
why
she
should
be
tempt
to
resume
her
riding
when
Captain
Lydgate
,
who
have
order
his
man
with
two
horse
to
follow
him
and
put
up
at
the
"
Green
Dragon
,
"
beg
her
to
go
out
on
the
gray
which
he
warrant
to
be
gentle
and
train
to
carry
a
lady
 
indeed
,
he
have
buy
it
for
his
sister
,
and
be
take
it
to
Quallingham
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
go
out
the
first
time
without
tell
her
husband
,
and
come
back
before
his
return
;
but
the
ride
have
be
so
thorough
a
success
,
and
she
declare
herself
so
much
the
well
in
consequence
,
that
he
be
inform
of
it
with
full
reliance
on
his
consent
that
she
should
go
ride
again
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
Lydgate
be
more
than
hurt
 
he
be
utterly
confound
that
she
have
risk
herself
on
a
strange
horse
without
refer
the
matter
to
his
wish
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
first
almost
thunder
exclamation
of
astonishment
,
which
sufficiently
warn
Rosamond
of
what
be
come
,
he
be
silent
for
some
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
however
,
you
have
come
back
safely
,
"
he
say
,
at
last
,
in
a
decisive
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
go
again
,
Rosy
;
that
be
understand
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
the
quiet
,
most
familiar
horse
in
the
world
<EOS>
,
there
would
always
be
the
chance
of
accident
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
very
well
that
I
wish
you
to
give
up
ride
the
roan
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
the
chance
of
accident
indoor
,
Tertius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
,
do
not
talk
nonsense
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
in
an
imploring
tone
;
"
surely
I
be
the
person
to
judge
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
enough
that
I
say
you
be
not
to
go
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
arrange
her
hair
before
dinner
,
and
the
reflection
of
her
head
in
the
glass
show
no
change
in
its
loveliness
except
a
little
turning
aside
of
the
long
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
be
move
about
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
now
pause
near
her
,
as
if
he
await
some
assurance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
fasten
up
my
plait
,
dear
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
let
her
arm
fall
with
a
little
sigh
,
so
as
to
make
a
husband
ashamed
of
stand
there
like
a
brute
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
often
fasten
the
plait
before
,
be
among
the
deft
of
man
with
his
large
finely
form
finger
.
 
<EOS>
He
sweep
up
the
soft
festoon
of
plait
and
fasten
in
the
tall
comb
(
to
such
use
do
man
come
!
)
;
and
what
could
he
do
then
but
kiss
the
exquisite
nape
which
be
show
in
all
its
delicate
curve
?
<EOS>
but
when
we
do
what
we
have
do
before
,
it
be
often
with
a
difference
.
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
still
angry
,
and
have
not
forget
his
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
the
captain
that
he
ought
to
have
know
well
than
offer
you
his
horse
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
move
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
will
not
do
anything
of
the
kind
,
Tertius
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
look
at
him
with
something
more
marked
than
usual
in
her
speech
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
treat
me
as
if
I
be
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
promise
that
you
will
leave
the
subject
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
do
seem
to
be
some
truth
in
her
objection
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
say
,
"
very
well
,
"
with
a
surly
obedience
,
and
thus
the
discussion
end
with
his
promising
rosamond
,
and
not
with
her
promise
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
she
have
be
determine
not
to
promise
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
that
victorious
obstinacy
which
never
waste
its
energy
in
impetuous
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
like
to
do
be
to
her
the
right
thing
,
and
all
her
cleverness
be
direct
to
get
the
mean
of
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
mean
to
go
out
ride
again
on
the
gray
,
and
she
do
go
on
the
next
opportunity
of
her
husband
's
absence
,
not
intend
that
he
should
know
until
it
be
late
enough
not
to
signify
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
temptation
be
certainly
great
:
she
be
very
fond
of
the
exercise
,
and
the
gratification
of
ride
on
a
fine
horse
,
with
Captain
Lydgate
,
Sir
Godwin
's
son
,
on
another
fine
horse
by
her
side
,
and
of
be
meet
in
this
position
by
any
one
but
her
husband
,
be
something
as
good
as
her
dream
before
marriage
:
moreover
she
be
rivet
the
connection
with
the
family
at
Quallingham
,
which
must
be
a
wise
thing
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
gentle
gray
,
unprepared
for
the
crash
of
a
tree
that
be
be
fell
on
the
edge
of
Halsell
wood
,
take
fright
,
and
cause
a
bad
fright
to
Rosamond
,
lead
finally
to
the
loss
of
her
baby
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
could
not
show
his
anger
towards
her
,
but
he
be
rather
bearish
to
the
Captain
,
whose
visit
naturally
soon
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
future
conversation
on
the
subject
,
Rosamond
be
mildly
certain
that
the
ride
have
make
no
difference
,
and
that
if
she
have
stay
at
home
the
same
symptom
would
have
come
on
and
would
have
end
in
the
same
way
,
because
she
have
feel
something
like
them
before
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
could
only
say
,
"
poor
,
poor
darling
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
secretly
wonder
over
the
terrible
tenacity
of
this
mild
creature
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
gather
within
him
an
amazed
sense
of
his
powerlessness
over
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
His
superior
knowledge
and
mental
force
,
instead
of
be
,
as
he
have
imagine
,
a
shrine
to
consult
on
all
occasion
,
be
simply
set
aside
on
every
practical
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
regard
Rosamond
's
cleverness
as
precisely
of
the
receptive
kind
which
become
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
begin
to
find
out
what
that
cleverness
be
 
what
be
the
shape
into
which
it
have
run
as
into
a
close
network
aloof
and
independent
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
quick
than
Rosamond
to
see
cause
and
effect
which
lie
within
the
track
of
her
own
taste
and
interest
:
she
have
see
clearly
Lydgate
's
preeminence
in
Middlemarch
society
,
and
could
go
on
imaginatively
trace
still
more
agreeable
social
effect
when
his
talent
should
have
advance
him
;
but
for
her
,
his
professional
and
scientific
ambition
have
no
other
relation
to
these
desirable
effect
than
if
they
have
be
the
fortunate
discovery
of
an
ill
-
smell
oil
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
oil
apart
,
with
which
she
have
nothing
to
do
,
of
course
she
believe
in
her
own
opinion
more
than
she
do
in
his
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
astounded
to
find
in
numberless
trifling
matter
,
as
well
as
in
this
last
serious
case
of
the
riding
,
that
affection
do
not
make
her
compliant
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
doubt
that
the
affection
be
there
,
and
have
no
presentiment
that
he
have
do
anything
to
repel
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
his
own
part
he
say
to
himself
that
he
love
her
as
tenderly
as
ever
,
and
could
make
up
his
mind
to
her
negation
;
but
 
well
!
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
much
worried
,
and
conscious
of
new
element
in
his
life
as
noxious
to
him
as
an
inlet
of
mud
to
a
creature
that
have
be
use
to
breathe
and
bathe
and
dart
after
its
illuminate
prey
in
the
clear
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
soon
look
lovely
than
ever
at
her
worktable
,
enjoy
drive
in
her
father
's
phaeton
and
think
it
likely
that
she
may
be
invite
to
Quallingham
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
be
a
much
more
exquisite
ornament
to
the
drawing
-
room
there
than
any
daughter
of
the
family
,
and
in
reflect
that
the
gentleman
be
aware
of
that
,
do
not
perhaps
sufficiently
consider
whether
the
lady
would
be
eager
to
see
themselves
surpass
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
,
relieve
from
anxiety
about
her
,
relapse
into
what
she
inwardly
call
his
moodiness
 
a
name
which
to
her
covered
his
thoughtful
preoccupation
with
other
subject
than
herself
,
as
well
as
that
uneasy
look
of
the
brow
and
distaste
for
all
ordinary
thing
as
if
they
be
mix
with
bitter
herb
,
which
really
make
a
sort
of
weather
-
glass
to
his
vexation
and
foreboding
.
 
<EOS>
these
latter
state
of
mind
have
one
cause
amongst
other
,
which
he
have
generously
but
mistakenly
avoid
mention
to
Rosamond
,
lest
it
should
affect
her
health
and
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
between
him
and
her
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
that
total
missing
of
each
other
's
mental
track
,
which
be
too
evidently
possible
even
between
person
who
be
continually
think
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
to
lydgate
it
seem
that
he
have
be
spend
month
after
month
in
sacrifice
more
than
half
of
his
good
intent
and
good
power
to
his
tenderness
for
Rosamond
;
bear
her
little
claim
and
interruption
without
impatience
,
and
,
above
all
,
bear
without
betrayal
of
bitterness
to
look
through
less
and
less
of
interfere
illusion
at
the
blank
unreflecting
surface
her
mind
present
to
his
ardor
for
the
more
impersonal
end
of
his
profession
and
his
scientific
study
,
an
ardor
which
he
have
fancy
that
the
ideal
wife
must
somehow
worship
as
sublime
,
though
not
in
the
least
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
endurance
be
mingle
with
a
self
-
discontent
which
,
if
we
know
how
to
be
candid
,
we
shall
confess
to
make
more
than
half
our
bitterness
under
grievance
,
wife
or
husband
include
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
remain
true
that
if
we
have
be
great
,
circumstance
would
have
be
less
strong
against
us
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
aware
that
his
concession
to
Rosamond
be
often
little
more
than
the
lapse
of
slacken
resolution
,
the
creep
paralysis
apt
to
seize
an
enthusiasm
which
be
out
of
adjustment
to
a
constant
portion
of
our
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
on
Lydgate
's
enthusiasm
there
be
constantly
press
not
a
simple
weight
of
sorrow
,
but
the
biting
presence
of
a
petty
degrade
care
,
such
as
cast
the
blight
of
irony
over
all
high
effort
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
care
which
he
have
hitherto
abstain
from
mention
to
Rosamond
;
and
he
believe
,
with
some
wonder
,
that
it
have
never
enter
her
mind
,
though
certainly
no
difficulty
could
be
less
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
inference
with
a
conspicuous
handle
to
it
,
and
have
be
easily
draw
by
indifferent
observer
,
that
Lydgate
be
in
debt
;
and
he
could
not
succeed
in
keep
out
of
his
mind
for
long
together
that
he
be
every
day
get
deep
into
that
swamp
,
which
tempt
man
towards
it
with
such
a
pretty
covering
of
flower
and
verdure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
soon
a
man
get
up
to
his
chin
there
 
in
a
condition
in
which
,
spite
of
himself
,
he
be
force
to
think
chiefly
of
release
,
though
he
have
a
scheme
of
the
universe
in
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
eighteen
month
ago
Lydgate
be
poor
,
but
have
never
know
the
eager
want
of
small
sum
,
and
feel
rather
a
burn
contempt
for
any
one
who
descend
a
step
in
order
to
gain
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
experience
something
bad
than
a
simple
deficit
:
he
be
assail
by
the
vulgar
hateful
trial
of
a
man
who
have
buy
and
use
a
great
many
thing
which
may
have
be
do
without
,
and
which
he
be
unable
to
pay
for
,
though
the
demand
for
payment
have
become
press
.
  
<EOS>
how
this
come
about
may
be
easily
see
without
much
arithmetic
or
knowledge
of
price
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
man
in
set
up
a
house
and
prepare
for
marriage
find
that
his
furniture
and
other
initial
expense
come
to
between
four
and
five
hundred
pound
more
than
he
have
capital
to
pay
for
;
when
at
the
end
of
a
year
it
appear
that
his
household
expense
,
horse
and
et
caetera
,
amount
to
nearly
a
thousand
,
while
the
proceed
of
the
practice
reckon
from
the
old
book
to
be
worth
eight
hundred
per
annum
have
sink
like
a
summer
pond
and
make
hardly
five
hundred
,
chiefly
in
unpaid
entry
<EOS>
,
the
plain
inference
be
that
,
whether
he
mind
it
or
not
,
he
be
in
debt
.
 
<EOS>
those
be
less
expensive
time
than
our
own
,
and
provincial
life
be
comparatively
modest
;
but
the
ease
with
which
a
medical
man
who
have
lately
buy
a
practice
,
who
think
that
he
be
oblige
to
keep
two
horse
,
whose
table
be
supply
without
stint
,
and
who
pay
an
insurance
on
his
life
and
a
high
rent
for
house
and
garden
,
may
find
his
expense
double
his
receipt
,
can
be
conceive
by
any
one
who
do
not
think
these
detail
beneath
his
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
accustom
from
her
childhood
to
an
extravagant
household
,
think
that
good
housekeeping
consist
simply
in
order
the
good
of
everything
 
nothing
else
"
answer
;
"
and
Lydgate
suppose
that
"
if
thing
be
do
at
all
,
they
must
be
do
properly
"
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
see
how
they
be
to
live
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
if
each
head
of
household
expenditure
have
be
mention
to
him
beforehand
,
he
would
have
probably
observe
that
"
it
could
hardly
come
to
much
,
"
and
if
any
one
have
suggest
a
saving
on
a
particular
article
 
for
example
,
the
substitution
of
cheap
fish
for
dear
 
<EOS>
it
would
have
appear
to
him
simply
a
penny
-
wise
,
mean
notion
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
even
without
such
an
occasion
as
Captain
Lydgate
's
visit
,
be
fond
of
give
invitation
,
and
Lydgate
,
though
he
often
think
the
guest
tiresome
,
do
not
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
this
sociability
seem
a
necessary
part
of
professional
prudence
,
and
the
entertainment
must
be
suitable
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
Lydgate
be
constantly
visit
the
home
of
the
poor
and
adjust
his
prescription
of
diet
to
their
small
mean
;
but
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
have
it
not
by
this
time
cease
to
be
remarkable
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
rather
that
we
expect
in
man
,
that
they
should
have
numerous
strand
of
experience
lying
side
by
side
and
never
compare
them
with
each
other
?
 
<EOS>
expenditure
 
<EOS>
like
ugliness
and
error
 
become
a
totally
new
thing
when
we
attach
our
own
personality
to
it
,
and
measure
it
by
that
wide
difference
which
be
manifest
(
in
our
own
sensation
)
between
ourselves
and
other
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
believe
himself
to
be
careless
about
his
dress
,
and
he
despise
a
man
who
calculate
the
effect
of
his
costume
;
it
seem
to
him
only
a
matter
of
course
that
he
have
abundance
of
fresh
garment
 
such
thing
be
naturally
order
in
sheaf
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that
he
have
never
hitherto
feel
the
check
of
importunate
debt
,
and
he
walk
by
habit
,
not
by
self
-
criticism
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
check
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
Its
novelty
make
it
the
more
irritating
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
amazed
,
disgust
that
condition
so
foreign
to
all
his
purpose
,
so
hatefully
disconnected
with
the
object
he
care
to
occupy
himself
with
,
should
have
lain
in
ambush
and
clutch
him
when
he
be
unaware
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
not
only
the
actual
debt
;
there
be
the
certainty
that
in
his
present
position
he
must
go
on
deepen
it
.
 
<EOS>
two
furnish
tradesman
at
Brassing
,
whose
bill
have
be
incur
before
his
marriage
,
and
whom
uncalculate
current
expense
have
ever
since
prevent
him
from
pay
,
have
repeatedly
send
him
unpleasant
letter
which
have
force
themselves
on
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
this
could
hardly
have
be
more
gall
to
any
disposition
than
to
Lydgate
's
,
with
his
intense
pride
 
<EOS>
his
dislike
of
ask
a
favor
or
be
under
an
obligation
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scorn
even
to
form
conjecture
about
Mr.
Vincy
's
intention
on
money
matter
,
and
nothing
but
extremity
could
have
induce
him
to
apply
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
even
if
he
have
not
be
make
aware
in
various
indirect
way
since
his
marriage
that
Mr.
Vincy
's
own
affair
be
not
flourish
,
and
that
the
expectation
of
help
from
him
would
be
resent
.
 
<EOS>
some
man
easily
trust
in
the
readiness
of
friend
;
it
have
never
in
the
former
part
of
his
life
occur
to
Lydgate
that
he
should
need
to
do
so
<EOS>
:
he
have
never
think
what
borrowing
would
be
to
him
;
but
now
that
the
idea
have
enter
his
mind
,
he
feel
that
he
would
rather
incur
any
other
hardship
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
he
have
no
money
or
prospect
of
money
;
and
his
practice
be
not
get
more
lucrative
.
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
Lydgate
have
be
unable
to
suppress
all
sign
of
inward
trouble
during
the
last
few
month
,
and
now
that
Rosamond
be
regain
brilliant
health
,
he
meditate
take
her
entirely
into
confidence
on
his
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
new
conversance
with
tradesman
's
bill
have
force
his
reasoning
into
a
new
channel
of
comparison
:
he
have
begin
to
consider
from
a
new
point
of
view
what
be
necessary
and
unnecessary
in
good
order
,
and
to
see
that
there
must
be
some
change
of
habit
.
<EOS>
how
could
such
a
change
be
make
without
Rosamond
's
concurrence
?
 
<EOS>
the
immediate
occasion
of
open
the
disagreeable
fact
to
her
be
force
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
have
no
money
,
and
have
privately
seek
advice
as
to
what
security
could
possibly
be
give
by
a
man
in
his
position
,
Lydgate
have
offer
the
one
good
security
in
his
power
to
the
less
peremptory
creditor
,
who
be
a
silversmith
and
jeweller
,
and
who
consent
to
take
on
himself
the
upholsterer
's
credit
also
,
accept
interest
for
a
give
term
.
<EOS>
the
security
necessary
be
a
bill
of
sale
on
the
furniture
of
his
house
,
which
may
make
a
creditor
easy
for
a
reasonable
time
about
a
debt
amount
to
less
than
four
hundred
pound
;
and
the
silversmith
,
Mr.
Dover
,
be
willing
to
reduce
it
by
take
back
a
portion
of
the
plate
and
any
other
article
which
be
as
good
as
new
.
 
<EOS>
"
any
other
article
"
be
a
phrase
delicately
imply
jewellery
,
and
more
particularly
some
purple
amethyst
cost
thirty
pound
,
which
Lydgate
have
buy
as
a
bridal
present
.
  
<EOS>
opinion
may
be
divide
as
to
his
wisdom
in
make
this
present
:
some
may
think
that
it
be
a
graceful
attention
to
be
expect
from
a
man
like
Lydgate
,
and
that
the
fault
of
any
troublesome
consequence
lie
in
the
pinched
narrowness
of
provincial
life
at
that
time
,
which
offer
no
convenience
for
professional
people
whose
fortune
be
not
proportion
to
their
taste
;
also
,
in
Lydgate
's
ridiculous
fastidiousness
about
ask
his
friend
for
money
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
have
seem
a
question
of
no
moment
to
him
on
that
fine
morning
when
he
go
to
give
a
final
order
for
plate
:
in
the
presence
of
other
jewel
enormously
expensive
,
and
as
an
addition
to
order
of
which
the
amount
have
not
be
exactly
calculate
,
thirty
pound
for
ornament
so
exquisitely
suited
to
Rosamond
's
neck
and
arm
could
hardly
appear
excessive
when
there
be
no
ready
cash
for
it
to
exceed
.
<EOS>
but
at
this
crisis
Lydgate
's
imagination
could
not
help
dwell
on
the
possibility
of
let
the
amethyst
take
their
place
again
among
Mr.
Dover
's
stock
,
though
he
shrink
from
the
idea
of
propose
this
to
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
have
be
rouse
to
discern
consequence
which
he
have
never
be
in
the
habit
of
tracing
,
he
be
prepare
to
act
on
this
discernment
with
some
of
the
rigor
(
by
no
means
all
)
that
he
would
have
apply
in
pursue
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
nerve
himself
to
this
rigor
as
he
ride
from
Brassing
,
and
meditate
on
the
representation
he
must
make
to
Rosamond
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
evening
when
he
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
intensely
miserable
,
this
strong
man
of
nine
-
and
-
twenty
and
of
many
gift
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
say
angrily
within
himself
that
he
have
make
a
profound
mistake
;
but
the
mistake
be
at
work
in
him
like
a
recognize
chronic
disease
,
mingle
its
uneasy
importunity
with
every
prospect
,
and
enfeeble
every
thought
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
go
along
the
passage
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
he
hear
the
piano
and
singing
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
Ladislaw
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
week
since
Will
have
part
from
Dorothea
,
yet
he
be
still
at
the
old
post
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
no
objection
in
general
to
Ladislaw
's
come
,
but
just
now
he
be
annoy
that
he
could
not
find
his
hearth
free
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
open
the
door
the
two
singer
go
on
towards
the
key
-
note
,
raise
their
eye
and
look
at
him
indeed
,
but
not
regard
his
entrance
as
an
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
to
a
man
gall
with
his
harness
as
poor
Lydgate
be
,
it
be
not
soothe
to
see
two
people
warble
at
him
,
as
he
come
in
with
the
sense
that
the
painful
day
have
still
pain
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
,
already
pale
than
usual
,
take
on
a
scowl
as
he
walk
across
the
room
and
fling
himself
into
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
the
singer
feel
themselves
excuse
by
the
fact
that
they
have
only
three
bar
to
sing
,
now
turn
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
,
Lydgate
?
"
say
Will
,
come
forward
to
shake
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
take
his
hand
,
but
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
dine
,
Tertius
?
 
<EOS>
I
expect
you
much
earlier
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
who
have
already
see
that
her
husband
be
in
a

horrible
humor

<EOS>
She
seat

<EOS>
"
I
have

<EOS>
I
should
like
some
tea

"
say
Lydgate
,
curtly
,
still
scowl
and
look
markedly
at
his
leg
<EOS>
stretch
out
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Will
be
too
quick
to
need
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
off

"
he
say
,
reach
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
tea
be
come

"
say
Rosamond
;
"
pray
do
not
go

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Lydgate
be
bore
,
"
say
Will
,
who
have
more
comprehension
of
Lydgate
than
Rosamond
have
,
and
be
not
offend
by
his
manner
,
easily
imagine
outdoor
cause
of
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
more
need
for
you
to
stay
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
playfully
,
and
in
her
light
accent
;
"
he
will
not
speak
to
me
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Rosamond
,
I
shall
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
in
his
strong
baritone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
serious
business
to
speak
to
you
about

"
  
<EOS>
no

of
the
business
could
have
be
less
like
that
which
Lydgate
have
intend
;
but
her
indifferent
manner
have
be
too
provoking
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
!
you
see
,
"
say
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
the
meeting
about
the
Mechanics
'
Institute
.
 
<EOS>
good
-
by
;
"
and
he
go
quickly
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
do
not
look
at
her
husband
,
but
presently
rise
and
take
her
place
before
the
tea
-
tray
.
<EOS>
She
be
think
that
she
have
never
see
him
so
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
turn
his
dark
eye
on
her
and
watch
her
as
she
delicately
handle
the
tea
-
service
with
her
taper
finger
,
and
look
at
the
object
immediately
before
her
with
no
curve
in
her
face
disturb
,
and
yet
with
an
ineffable
protest
in
her
air
against
all
people
with
unpleasant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
moment
he
lose
the
sense
of
his
wound
in
a
sudden
speculation
about
this
new
form
of
feminine
impassibility
reveal
itself
in
the
sylph
-
like
frame
which
he
have
once
interpret
as
the
sign
of
a
ready
intelligent
sensitiveness
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
glance
back
to
Laure
while
he
look
at
Rosamond
<EOS>
,
he
say
inwardly
,
"
Would
_
she
_
kill
me
because
I
weary
her
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
It
be
the
way
with
all
woman
.
"
<EOS>
but
this
power
of
generalizing
which
give
man
so
much
the
superiority
in
mistake
over
the
dumb
animal
,
be
immediately
thwart
by
Lydgate
's
memory
of
wonder
impression
from
the
behavior
of
another
woman
 
from
Dorothea
's
look
and
tone
of
emotion
about
her
husband
when
Lydgate
begin
to
attend
him
 
from
her
passionate
cry
to
be
teach
what
would
best
comfort
that
man
for
whose
sake
it
seem
as
if
she
must
quell
every
impulse
in
her
except
the
yearning
of
faithfulness
and
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
these
revive
impression
succeed
each
other
quickly
and
dreamily
in
Lydgate
's
mind
while
the
tea
be
be
brew
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
shut
his
eye
in
the
last
instant
of
reverie
while
he
hear
Dorothea
say
,
"
advise
me
 
think
what
I
can
do
 
<EOS>
he
have
be
all
his
life
labor
and
look
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
mind
about
nothing
else
 
<EOS>
and
I
mind
about
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
voice
of
deep
-
souled
womanhood
have
remain
within
him
as
the
enkindling
conception
of
dead
and
sceptre
genius
have
remain
within
him
(
be
there
not
a
genius
for
feel
nobly
which
also
reign
over
human
spirit
and
their
conclusion
?
)
;
the
tone
be
a
music
from
which
he
be
fall
away
 
<EOS>
he
have
really
fall
into
a
momentary
doze
,
when
Rosamond
say
in
her
silvery
neutral
way
,
"
here
be
your
tea
,
Tertius
,
"
set
it
on
the
small
table
by
his
side
,
and
then
move
back
to
her
place
without
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
too
hasty
in
attribute
insensibility
to
her
;
after
her
own
fashion
,
she
be
sensitive
enough
,
and
take
lasting
impression
.
 
<EOS>
Her
impression
now
be
one
of
offence
and
repulsion
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
Rosamond
have
no
scowl
and
have
never
raise
her
voice
:
she
be
quite
sure
that
no
one
could
justly
find
fault
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Lydgate
and
she
have
never
feel
so
far
off
each
other
before
;
but
there
be
strong
reason
for
not
defer
his
revelation
,
even
if
he
have
not
already
begin
it
by
that
abrupt
announcement
;
indeed
some
of
the
angry
desire
to
rouse
her
into
more
sensibility
on
his
account
which
have
prompt
him
to
speak
prematurely
,
still
mingle
with
his
pain
in
the
prospect
of
her
pain
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
wait
till
the
tray
be
go
<EOS>
,
the
candle
be
light
,
and
the
evening
quiet
may
be
count
on
:
the
interval
have
leave
time
for
repel
tenderness
to
return
into
the
old
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Rosy
,
lie
down
your
work
and
come
to
sit
by
me
,
"
he
say
,
gently
,
push
away
the
table
,
and
stretch
out
his
arm
to
draw
a
chair
near
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
obey
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
come
towards
him
in
her
drapery
of
transparent
faintly
tint
muslin
,
her
slim
yet
round
figure
never
look
more
graceful
;
as
she
sit
down
by
him
and
lay
one
hand
on
the
elbow
of
his
chair
,
at
last
look
at
him
and
meet
his
eye
,
her
delicate
neck
and
cheek
and
purely
cut
lip
never
have
more
of
that
untarnished
beauty
which
touch
as
in
spring
-
time
and
infancy
and
all
sweet
freshness
.
<EOS>
It
touch
Lydgate
now
,
and
mingle
the
early
moment
of
his
love
for
her
with
all
the
other
memory
which
be
stir
in
this
crisis
of
deep
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
his
ample
hand
softly
on
hers
,
say
    
"
Dear
!
"
<EOS>
with
the
linger
utterance
which
affection
give
to
the
word
.
<EOS>
rosamond
too
be
still
under
the
power
of
that
same
past
,
and
her
husband
be
still
in
part
the
Lydgate
whose
approval
have
stir
delight
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
his
hair
lightly
away
from
his
forehead
,
then
lay
her
other
hand
on
his
,
and
be
conscious
of
forgive
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
oblige
to
tell
you
what
will
hurt
you
,
Rosy
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
thing
which
husband
and
wife
must
think
of
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
have
occur
to
you
already
that
I
be
short
of
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
pause
;
but
Rosamond
turn
her
neck
and
look
at
a
vase
on
the
mantel
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
able
to
pay
for
all
the
thing
we
have
to
get
before
we
be
married
,
and
there
have
be
expense
since
which
I
have
be
oblige
to
meet
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
there
be
a
large
debt
at
brasse
 
three
hundred
and
eighty
pound
 
which
have
be
press
on
me
a
good
while
,
and
in
fact
we
be
get
deep
every
day
,
for
people
do
not
pay
me
the
faster
because
other
want
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
pain
to
keep
it
from
you
while
you
be
not
well
;
but
now
we
must
think
together
about
it
,
and
you
must
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
 
I
 
do
,
Tertius
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
turn
her
eye
on
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
that
little
speech
of
four
word
,
like
so
many
other
in
all
language
,
be
capable
by
varied
vocal
inflection
of
express
all
state
of
mind
from
helpless
dimness
to
exhaustive
argumentative
perception
,
from
the
complete
self
-
devote
fellowship
to
the
most
neutral
aloofness
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
's
thin
utterance
throw
into
the
word
"
what
can
 
I
 
do
!
"
<EOS>
as
much
neutrality
as
they
could
hold
.
 
<EOS>
They
fall
like
a
mortal
chill
on
Lydgate
's
rouse
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
storm
in
indignation
 
<EOS>
he
feel
too
sad
a
sinking
of
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
speak
again
it
be
more
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
force
himself
to
fulfil
a
task
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
necessary
for
you
to
know
,
because
I
have
to
give
security
for
a
time
,
and
a
man
must
come
to
make
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
colored
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
not
ask
papa
for
money
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
ask
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
release
her
hand
from
Lydgate
's
,
and
rise
to
stand
at
two
yard
'
distance
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Rosy
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
late
to
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
the
inventory
will
be
begin
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
remember
it
be
a
mere
security
:
it
will
make
no
difference
:
it
be
a
temporary
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
it
that
your
father
shall
not
know
,
unless
I
choose
to
tell
him
,
"
add
Lydgate
,
with
a
more
peremptory
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
this
certainly
be
unkind
,
but
Rosamond
have
throw
him
back
on
evil
expectation
as
to
what
she
would
do
in
the
way
of
quiet
steady
disobedience
.
 
<EOS>
the
unkindness
seem
unpardonable
to
her
:
she
be
not
give
to
weep
and
dislike
it
,
but
now
her
chin
and
lip
begin
to
tremble
and
the
tear
well
up
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
not
possible
for
Lydgate
,
under
the
double
stress
of
outward
material
difficulty
and
of
his
own
proud
resistance
to
humiliating
consequence
,
to
imagine
fully
what
this
sudden
trial
be
to
a
young
creature
who
have
know
nothing
but
indulgence
,
and
whose
dream
have
all
be
of
new
indulgence
,
more
exactly
to
her
taste
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
wish
to
spare
her
as
much
as
he
could
,
and
her
tear
cut
him
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
again
immediately
;
but
Rosamond
do
not
go
on
sob
<EOS>
:
she
try
to
conquer
her
agitation
and
wipe
away
her
tear
,
continue
to
look
before
her
at
the
mantel
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
try
not
to
grieve
,
darling
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
turn
his
eye
up
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
have
choose
to
move
away
from
him
in
this
moment
of
her
trouble
make
everything
harder
to
say
,
but
he
must
absolutely
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
brace
ourselves
to
do
what
be
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
I
who
have
be
in
fault
:
I
ought
to
have
see
that
I
could
not
afford
-
to
live
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
but
many
thing
have
tell
against
me
in
my
practice
,
and
it
really
just
now
have
ebb
to
a
low
point
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
recover
it
,
but
in
the
mean
time
we
must
pull
up
 
<EOS>
we
must
change
our
way
of
living
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
weather
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
give
this
security
I
shall
have
time
to
look
about
me
;
and
you
be
so
clever
that
if
you
turn
your
mind
to
manage
you
will
school
me
into
carefulness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
thoughtless
rascal
about
squaring
price
 
but
come
,
dear
,
sit
down
and
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
be
bow
his
neck
under
the
yoke
like
a
creature
who
have
talon
,
but
who
have
reason
too
,
which
often
reduce
us
to
meekness
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
speak
the
last
word
in
an
imploring
tone
,
Rosamond
return
to
the
chair
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
His
self
-
blame
give
her
some
hope
that
he
would
attend
to
her
opinion
,
and
she
say
    
"
why
can
you
not
put
off
have
the
inventory
make
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
send
the
man
away
to
-
morrow
when
they
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
send
them
away
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
the
peremptoriness
rise
again
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
of
any
use
to
explain
?
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
leave
Middlemarch
?
<EOS>
there
would
of
course
be
a
sale
,
and
that
would
do
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
be
not
go
to
leave
Middlemarch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
Tertius
,
it
would
be
much
well
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
why
can
we
not
go
to
London
?
 
<EOS>
or
near
Durham
,
where
your
family
be
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
go
nowhere
without
money
,
Rosamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
would
not
wish
you
to
be
without
money
.
 
<EOS>
and
surely
these
odious
tradesman
may
be
make
to
understand
that
,
and
to
wait
,
if
you
would
make
proper
representation
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
idle
rosamond
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
learn
to
take
my
judgment
on
question
you
do
not
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
necessary
arrangement
,
and
they
must
be
carry
out
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
friend
,
I
have
no
expectation
whatever
from
them
,
and
shall
not
ask
them
for
anything

"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
sit
perfectly
still
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
in
her
mind
be
that
if
she
have
know
how
Lydgate
would
behave
,
she
would
never
have
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
time
to
waste
now
on
unnecessary
word
,
dear
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
try
to
be
gentle
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
detail
that
I
want
to
consider
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Dover
say
he
will
take
a
good
deal
of
the
plate
back
again
,
and
any
of
the
jewellery
we
like
.
 
<EOS>
He
really
behave
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
we
to
go
without
spoon
and
fork
then
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
whose
very
lip
seem
to
get
thin
with
the
thinness
of
her
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
determined
to
make
no
further
resistance
or
suggestion
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
dear
!
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
look
here
,
"
he
continue
,
draw
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
open
it
;
"
here
be
Dover
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
see
,
I
have
mark
a
number
of
article
,
which
if
we
return
them
would
reduce
the
amount
by
thirty
pound
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
mark
any
of
the
jewellery
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
really
feel
this
point
of
the
jewellery
very
bitter
to
himself
;
but
he
have
overcome
the
feeling
by
severe
argument
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
propose
to
Rosamond
that
she
should
return
any
particular
present
of
his
,
but
he
have
tell
himself
that
he
be
bind
to
put
Dover
's
offer
before
her
,
and
her
inward
prompting
may
make
the
affair
easy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
useless
for
me
to
look
,
Tertius
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
calmly
;
"
you
will
return
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
turn
her
eye
on
the
paper
,
and
Lydgate
,
flush
up
to
the
root
of
his
hair
,
draw
it
back
and
let
it
fall
on
his
knee
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
Rosamond
quietly
go
out
of
the
room
,
leave
Lydgate
helpless
and
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
not
come
back
?
 
<EOS>
It
seem
that
she

He
toss
his

his

deep
into

of

<EOS>
there

there

He

She

You

You

I
shall
go

"
  
<EOS>
to
many
woman
the
look
Lydgate
cast
at
her
would
have
be
more
terrible
than
one
of
anger
:
it
have
in
it
a
despairing
acceptance
of
the
distance
she
be
place
between
them

<EOS>
"
and
when
shall
you
come
back
again

<EOS>
he

with
a
bitter
edge
on

"
oh

in

<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
not

the

"
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
convince
that
no
woman
could
behave
more
irreproachably
than
she
be
behave
;
and
she
go
to
sit
down
at
her
work
-
table
.
<EOS>
Lydgate
sit
meditate
a
minute
or
two
,
and
the
result
be
that
he
say
,
with
some
of
the
old
emotion
in
his
tone
    
"
now
we
have
be
unite

Rosy

you
should
not
leave
me
to
myself
in
the
first
trouble
that
have
come

<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not

say
Rosamond

"
I
shall
do
everything
it
become

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
right
that
the

leave
to

that
I

have
to
speak
to
them
about
it

I

go
out

I

I
understand
your

,
my

Rosamond
,
as
a
question
of
pride
,
which
I
feel
just
as
much
as
you
can
,
it
be
surely
well
to
manage
the
thing
ourselves

let
the

see
as
little
of

possible

since

there

Rosamond
do

at

she

,
"
very
well

I
will

I

I
will

we

where

rise

throw
the

on

large
table
where
he
mean
to
write

<EOS>
Rosamond
go
to
reach
the
inkstand

and
after
set
it
on
the

be
go
to
turn
away

when
Lydgate

who
be

close

put
his

It

kiss

"
  
<EOS>
His
native
warm

heartedness
take
a
great
deal
of
quenching
,
and
it
be
a
part
of
manliness
for
a

to
feel
keenly
the
fact
that
an
inexperienced

have
get
into

She
receive

return
it
faintly
,
and
in
this
way
an
appearance
of
accord
be
recover
for
the
time

<EOS>
but
Lydgate
could
not
help
look
forward
with
dread
to
the
inevitable
future
discussion
about
expenditure
and
the
necessity
for
a
complete
change

They

"
  
<EOS>
news
be
often
disperse
as
thoughtlessly
and
effectively
as
that
pollen
which
the
bee
carry
off
(
have
no
idea
how
powdery
they
be
)
when
they

<EOS>
this
fine
comparison
have
reference
to
Fred
Vincy
,
who
on
that
evening
at
Lowick
Parsonage
hear
a
lively
discussion
among
the
lady
on
the
news
which
their
old
servant
have
get
from
Tantripp
concern
Mr.
Casaubon
's
strange
mention
of
Mr.
Ladislaw
in
a
codicil
to
his
will
make
not
long
before
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Winifred
be
astounded
to
find
that
her
brother
have
know
the
fact
before
,
and
observe
that
Camden
be
the
most
wonderful
man
for
know
thing
and
not
tell
them
;
whereupon
Mary
Garth
say
that
the
codicil
have
perhaps
get
mix
up
with
the
habit
of
spider
,
which
Miss
Winifred
never
would
listen
to
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Farebrother
consider
that
the
news
have
something
to
do
with
their
have
only
once
see
Mr.
Ladislaw
at
Lowick
,
and
Miss
Noble
make
many
small
compassionate
mewing
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
know
little
and
care
less
about
Ladislaw
and
the
Casaubons
,
and
his
mind
never
recur
to
that
discussion
till
one
day
call
on
Rosamond
at
his
mother
's
request
to
deliver
a
message
as
he
pass
,
he
happen
to
see
Ladislaw
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
and
Rosamond
have
little
to
say
to
each
other
now
that
marriage
have
remove
her
from
collision
with
the
unpleasantness
of
brother
,
and
especially
now
that
he
have
take
what
she
hold
the
stupid
and
even
reprehensible
step
of
give
up
the
Church
to
take
to
such
a
business
as
Mr.
Garth
's
.
<EOS>
hence
Fred
talk
by
preference
of
what
he
consider
indifferent
news
,
and
"
a
propos
of
that
young
Ladislaw
"
mention
what
he
have
hear
at
Lowick
Parsonage
.
  
<EOS>
now
Lydgate
,
like
Mr.
Farebrother
,
know
a
great
deal
more
than
he
tell
,
and
when
he
have
once
be
set
think
about
the
relation
between
Will
and
Dorothea
his
conjecture
have
go
beyond
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
He
imagine
that
there
be
a
passionate
attachment
on
both
side
,
and
this
strike
him
as
much
too
serious
to
gossip
about
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
Will
's
irritability
when
he
have
mention
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
be
the
more
circumspect
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
his
surmise
,
in
addition
to
what
he
know
of
the
fact
,
increase
his
friendliness
and
tolerance
towards
Ladislaw
,
and
make
him
understand
the
vacillation
which
keep
him
at
Middlemarch
after
he
have
say
that
he
should
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
significant
of
the
separateness
between
Lydgate
's
mind
and
Rosamond
's
that
he
have
no
impulse
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
;
indeed
,
he
do
not
quite
trust
her
reticence
towards
Will
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
right
there
;
though
he
have
no
vision
of
the
way
in
which
her
mind
would
act
in
urge
her
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
repeat
Fred
's
news
to
Lydgate
,
he
say
,
"
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
not
drop
the
faint
hint
to
Ladislaw
,
Rosy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
likely
to
fly
out
as
if
you
insult
him
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
a
painful
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
turn
her
neck
and
pat
her
hair
,
look
the
image
of
placid
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
next
time
Will
come
when
Lydgate
be
away
<EOS>
,
she
speak
archly
about
his
not
go
to
London
as
he
have
threaten
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
confidential
little
bird
,
"
say
she
,
show
very
pretty
air
of
her
head
over
the
bit
of
work
hold
high
between
her
active
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
powerful
magnet
in
this
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
there
be
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
know
that
well
than
you
,
"
say
Will
,
with
light
gallantry
,
but
inwardly
prepared
to
be
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
really
the
most
charming
romance
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Casaubon
jealous
,
and
foresee
that
there
be
no
one
else
whom
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
so
much
like
to
marry
,
and
no
one
who
would
so
much
like
to
marry
her
as
a
certain
gentleman
;
and
then
lay
a
plan
to
spoil
all
by
make
her
forfeit
her
property
if
she
do
marry
that
gentleman
 
<EOS>
and
then
 
and
then
 
and
then
 
oh
,
I
have
no
doubt
the
end
will
be
thoroughly
romantic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Great
God
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
Will
,
flush
over
face
and
ear
,
his
feature
seem
to
change
as
if
he
have
have
a
violent
shake
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
joke
;
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
really
know
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
no
longer
playful
,
and
desire
nothing
well
than
to
tell
in
order
that
she
may
evoke
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
return
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
know
that
Mr.
Casaubon
have
leave
it
in
his
will
that
if
Mrs.
Casaubon
marry
you
she
be
to
forfeit
all
her
property
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
that
it
be
true
?
"
say
Will
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
Fred
hear
it
from
the
Farebrothers
.
<EOS>
"
 
Will
start
up
from
his
chair
and
reach
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
like
you
better
than
the
property
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
look
at
him
from
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
say
any
more
about
it
,
"
say
Will
,
in
a
hoarse
undertone
extremely
unlike
his
usual
light
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
foul
insult
to
her
and
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
sit
down
absently
,
look
before
him
,
but
see
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
you
be
angry
with
_
me
_
,
"
say
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
bad
to
bear
_
me
_
malice

<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
oblige
to
me
for
tell
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
be
,
"
say
Will
,
abruptly
,
speak
with
that
kind
of
double
soul
which
belong
to
dreamer
who
answer
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expect
to
hear
of

"
say
Rosamond
,
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
never

<EOS>
You
will
never
hear
of
the
marriage

"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
utter
impetuously
,
Will
rise
,
put
out
his
hand
to
Rosamond
,
still
with
the
air
of
a
somnambulist
,
and
go
away

<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Rosamond
leave
her
chair
and
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
lean
when
she
get
there
against
a
chiffonniere
,
and
look
out
of
the
window
wearily

<EOS>
She
be
oppress
by
ennui

and
by
that
dissatisfaction
which
in

mind
be
continually
turn
into
a
trivial
jealousy

refer
to
no
real
claim

spring
from
no
deep
passion
than
the
vague
exactingness
of
egoism

capable

impelling
action
as
well
as
speech

<EOS>
"
there
really
be
nothing
to
care
for
much
,
"
say
poor
Rosamond
inwardly
,
think
of
the
family
at
Quallingham
,
who
do
not
write
to
her
;
and
that
perhaps
Tertius
when
he
come
home
would
tease
her
about

<EOS>
She
have
already
secretly
disobey
him
by

he
have
end
decisively
by

a
few
day
afterwards

it
be
already
the
end
of
August
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
occasion
which
cause
some
excitement

if
it

the
advantage
of

<EOS>
this
be
not
one
of
the
sale
indicate
the
depression
of

;
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
due
to
Mr.

's
great
success
in

which
warrant

<EOS>
Mr.

the

Mr.

have
call
at

would
obligingly
use
his
remarkable

judge
of
the
value
of
this
particular
painting
 
"
if

add
the
scrupulously
polite
banker
,
"
attendance
at
the
sale
would
not
interfere
with
the
arrangement
for
your
departure
,
which
I
know
be
imminent
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
proviso
may
have
sound
rather
satirically
in
Will
's
ear
if
he
have
be
in
a
mood
to
care
about
such
satire
.
 
<EOS>
It
refer
to
an
understanding
enter
into
many
week
before
with
the
proprietor
of
the
paper
,
that
he
should
be
at
liberty
any
day
he
please
to
hand
over
the
management
to
the
subeditor
whom
he
have
be
train
;
since
he
wish
finally
to
quit
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
but
indefinite
vision
of
ambition
be
weak
against
the
ease
of
do
what
be
habitual
or
beguilingly
agreeable
;
and
we
all
know
the
difficulty
of
carry
out
a
resolve
when
we
secretly
long
that
it
may
turn
out
to
be
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
in
such
state
of
mind
the
most
incredulous
person
have
a
private
leaning
towards
miracle
:
impossible
to
conceive
how
our
wish
could
be
fulfil
,
still
 
very
wonderful
thing
have
happen
!
 
<EOS>
Will
do
not
confess
this
weakness
to
himself
,
but
he
linger
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
go
to
London
at
that
time
of
the
year
?
 
<EOS>
the
Rugby
man
who
would
remember
him
be
not
there
;
and
so
far
as
political
writing
be
concern
,
he
would
rather
for
a
few
week
go
on
with
the
"
Pioneer
.
"
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
,
however
,
when
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
speak
to
him
,
he
have
both
a
strengthen
resolve
to
go
and
an
equally
strong
resolve
not
to
go
till
he
have
once
more
see
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
reply
that
he
have
reason
for
defer
his
departure
a
little
,
and
would
be
happy
to
go
to
the
sale
.
  
<EOS>
will
be
in
a
defiant
mood
,
his
consciousness
be
deeply
sting
with
the
thought
that
the
people
who
look
at
him
probably
know
a
fact
tantamount
to
an
accusation
against
him
as
a
fellow
with
low
design
which
be
to
be
frustrate
by
a
disposal
of
property
.
 
<EOS>
like
most
people
who
assert
their
freedom
with
regard
to
conventional
distinction
,
he
be
prepared
to
be
sudden
and
quick
at
quarrel
with
any
one
who
may
hint
that
he
have
personal
reason
for
that
assertion
 
that
there
be
anything
in
his
blood
,
his
bearing
,
or
his
character
to
which
he
give
the
mask
of
an
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
under
an
irritate
impression
of
this
kind
he
would
go
about
for
day
with
a
defiant
look
,
the
color
change
in
his
transparent
skin
as
if
he
be
on
the
qui
vive
,
watch
for
something
which
he
have
to
dart
upon
.
  
<EOS>
this
expression
be
peculiarly
noticeable
in
him
at
the
sale
,
and
those
who
have
only
see
him
in
his
mood
of
gentle
oddity
or
of
bright
enjoyment
would
have
be
strike
with
a
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
sorry
to
have
this
occasion
for
appear
in
public
before
the
Middlemarch
tribe
of
Toller
,
Hackbutt
,
and
the
rest
,
who
look
down
on
him
as
an
adventurer
,
and
be
in
a
state
of
brutal
ignorance
about
Dante
 
who
sneer
at
his
polish
blood
,
and
be
themselves
of
a
breed
very
much
in
need
of
cross
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
in
a
conspicuous
place
not
far
from
the
auctioneer
,
with
a
fore

finger
in
each
side

pocket
and
his
head
throw
backward

not
care
to
speak
to
anybody

cordially
welcome
as
a

by
Mr.

the
utmost
activity

his
great
faculty

<EOS>
and
surely
among
all
man
whose
vocation
require
them
to
exhibit
their
power
of
speech
,
the
happy
be
a
prosperous
provincial
auctioneer
keenly
alive
to
his
own
joke

sensible
of
his
encyclopedic
knowledge

<EOS>
some
saturnine

sour

object
to
be
constantly
insist
on
the
merit
of
all
article
from

but
Mr.

Trumbull
have
a

next

two

It

His

impose
swagger

make
him
a
striking

but
his
suit
of
black

rather
shabby
at
the

cause
the
prejudicial
inference
that
he
be
not
able
to
afford

at

<EOS>
the
bidding
be
brisk

Will
continue

remember
that
Mrs.

have
a
strong
wish
for
the
picture
,
and
think
that
he
may
stretch
the
price
to
twelve
pound
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
knock
down
to
him
at
ten
guinea
,
whereupon
he
push
his
way
towards
the
bow

window
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
choose
to
go
under
the
marquee
to
get
a
glass
of
water
,
be
hot
and
thirsty
<EOS>
:
it
be
empty
of
other
visitor

he
ask
the
woman
in
attendance
to
fetch
him
some
fresh
water
;
but
before
she
be
well
go
<EOS>
he
be
annoy
to
see
enter
the
florid
stranger
who
have
stare
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
strike
Will
at
this
moment
that
the
man
may
be
one
of
those
political
parasitic
insect
of
the
bloated
kind
who
have
once
or
twice
claim
acquaintance
with
him
as
have
hear
him
speak
on
the
Reform
question
,
and
who
may
think
of
get
a
shilling
by

<EOS>
in
this
light
his
person
,
already
rather
heat
to
behold
on
a

,
appear
the
more
disagreeable
;
and
Will

half

seat
on
the
elbow

garden

chair
,
turn
his
eye
carefully
away
from
the

this
signify
little

It

throw
out

a

the
slim

Hereupon

turn
himself
round
with
a

<EOS>
dreadfully
certain
of
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
red
-
faced
man
with
large
whisker
,
and
most
impudent
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
declare
he
be
an
old
friend
of
yours
,
and
say
you
would
be
sorry
not
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
want
to
wait
for
you
here
,
but
I
tell
him
he
could
see
you
at
the
Bank
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
most
impudent
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
stare
at
me
,
and
say
his
friend
Nick
have
luck
in
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
he
would
have
go
away
,
if
Blucher
have
not
happen
to
break
his
chain
and
come
run
round
on
the
gravel
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
in
the
garden
;
so
I
say
,
"
You
would
better
go
away
 
<EOS>
the
dog
be
very
fierce
,
and
I
can
not
hold
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
do
you
really
know
anything
of
such
a
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
know
who
he
be
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
his
usual
subdued
voice
,
"
an
unfortunate
dissolute
wretch
,
whom
I
help
too
much
in
day
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
presume
you
will
not
be
trouble
by
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
probably
come
to
the
Bank
 
to
beg
,
doubtless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
more
be
say
on
the
subject
until
the
next
day
,
when
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
return
from
the
town
and
be
dress
for
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
,
not
sure
that
he
be
come
home
,
look
into
his
dressing
-
room
and
see
him
with
his
coat
and
cravat
off
,
lean
one
arm
on
a
chest
of
drawer
and
stare
absently
at
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
nervously
and
look
up
as
she
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
ill
,
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
anything
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
good
deal
of
pain
in
my
head
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
be
so
frequently
ail
that
his
wife
be
always
ready
to
believe
in
this
cause
of
depression
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
and
let
me
sponge
it
with
vinegar
.
"
  
<EOS>
physically
Mr.
Bulstrode
do
not
want
the
vinegar
,
but
morally
the
affectionate
attention
soothe
him
.
 
<EOS>
though
always
polite
,
it
be
his
habit
to
receive
such
service
with
marital
coolness
,
as
his
wife
's
duty
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
,
while
she
be
bend
over
him
,
he
say
,
"
You
be
very
good
,
Harriet
,
"
in
a
tone
which
have
something
new
in
it
to
her
ear
;
she
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
novelty
be
,
but
her
woman
's
solicitude
shape
itself
into
a
dart
thought
that
he
may
be
go
to
have
an
illness
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
anything
worry
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
that
man
come
to
you
at
the
Bank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
be
as
I
have
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
at
one
time
may
have
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
sink
into
a
drunken
debauch
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
he
quite
go
away
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
anxiously
but
for
certain
reason
she
refrain
from
add
,
"
It
be
very
disagreeable
to
hear
him
call
himself
a
friend
of
yours
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
she
would
not
have
like
to
say
anything
which
imply
her
habitual
consciousness
that
her
husband
's
early
connection
be
not
quite
on
a
level
with
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
she
know
much
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
her
husband
have
at
first
be
employ
in
a
bank
,
that
he
have
afterwards
enter
into
what
he
call
city
business
and
gain
a
fortune
before
he
be
three
-
and
-
thirty
,
that
he
have
marry
a
widow
who
be
much
old
than
himself
 
a
Dissenter
,
and
in
other
way
probably
of
that
disadvantageous
quality
usually
perceptible
in
a
first
wife
if
inquire
into
with
the
dispassionate
judgment
of
a
second
 
<EOS>
be
almost
as
much
as
she
have
care
to
learn
beyond
the
glimpse
which
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
narrative
occasionally
give
of
his
early
bent
towards
religion
,
his
inclination
to
be
a
preacher
,
and
his
association
with
missionary
and
philanthropic
effort
.
 
<EOS>
She
believe
in
him
as
an
excellent
man
whose
piety
carry
a
peculiar
eminence
in
belong
to
a
layman
,
whose
influence
have
turn
her
own
mind
toward
seriousness
,
and
whose
share
of
perishable
good
have
be
the
mean
of
raise
her
own
position
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
also
like
to
think
that
it
be
well
in
every
sense
for
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
have
win
the
hand
of
Harriet
Vincy
;
whose
family
be
undeniable
in
a
Middlemarch
light
 
a
well
light
surely
than
any
throw
in
London
thoroughfare
or
dissent
chapel
-
yard
.
<EOS>
the
unreformed
provincial
mind
distrust
London
;
and
while
true
religion
be
everywhere
save
,
honest
Mrs.
Bulstrode
be
convince
that
to
be
save
in
the
Church
be
more
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
She
so
much
wish
to
ignore
towards
other
that
her
husband
have
ever
be
a
London
Dissenter
,
that
she
like
to
keep
it
out
of
sight
even
in
talk
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
aware
of
this
;
indeed
in
some
respect
he
be
rather
afraid
of
this
ingenuous
wife
,
whose
imitative
piety
and
native
worldliness
be
equally
sincere
,
who
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
,
and
whom
he
have
marry
out
of
a
thorough
inclination
still
subsist
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
fear
be
such
as
belong
to
a
man
who
care
to
maintain
his
recognize
supremacy
:
the
loss
of
high
consideration
from
his
wife
,
as
from
every
one
else
who
do
not
clearly
hate
him
out
of
enmity
to
the
truth
,
would
be
as
the
beginning
of
death
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
say
    
"
be
he
quite
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
trust
so
,
"
he
answer
,
with
an
effort
to
throw
as
much
sober
unconcern
into
his
tone
as
possible
!
  
<EOS>
but
in
truth
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
very
far
from
a
state
of
quiet
trust
.
<EOS>
in
the
interview
at
the
Bank
,
Raffles
have
make
it
evident
that
his
eagerness
to
torment
be
almost
as
strong
in
him
as
any
other
greed
.
<EOS>
He
have
frankly
say
that
he
have
turn
out
of
the
way
to
come
to
Middlemarch
,
just
to
look
about
him
and
see
whether
the
neighborhood
would
suit
him
to
live
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
have
a
few
debt
to
pay
more
than
he
expect
,
but
the
two
hundred
pound
be
not
go
yet
:
<EOS>
a
cool
five
-
and
-
twenty
would
suffice
him
to
go
away
with
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
what
he
have
want
chiefly
be
to
see
his
friend
Nick
and
family
,
and
know
all
about
the
prosperity
of
a
man
to
whom
he
be
so
much
attach
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
he
may
come
back
for
a
long
stay
.
 
<EOS>
this
time
Raffles
decline
to
be
"
see
off
the
premise
,
"
as
he
express
it
 
decline
to
quit
Middlemarch
under
Bulstrode
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
mean
to
go
by
coach
the
next
day
 
if
he
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
feel
himself
helpless
.
 
<EOS>
neither
threat
nor
coax
could
avail
:
he
could
not
count
on
any
persistent
fear
nor
on
any
promise
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
feel
a
cold
certainty
at
his
heart
that
raffle
 
unless
providence
send
death
to
hinder
him
 
would
come
back
to
Middlemarch
before
long
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
certainty
be
a
terror
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
be
in
danger
of
legal
punishment
or
of
beggary
:
he
be
in
danger
only
of
see
disclose
to
the
judgment
of
his
neighbor
and
the
mournful
perception
of
his
wife
certain
fact
of
his
past
life
which
would
render
him
an
object
of
scorn
and
an
opprobrium
of
the
religion
with
which
he
have
diligently
associate
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
terror
of
be
judge
sharpen
the
memory
:
it
send
an
inevitable
glare
over
that
long
-
unvisited
past
which
have
be
habitually
recall
only
in
general
phrase
.
 
<EOS>
even
without
memory
,
the
life
be
bind
into
one
by
a
zone
of
dependence
in
growth
and
decay
;
but
intense
memory
force
a
man
to
own
his
blameworthy
past
.
 
<EOS>
with
memory
set
smart
like
a
reopen
wound
,
a
man
's
past
be
not
simply
a
dead
history
,
an
outworn
preparation
of
the
present
:
it
be
not
a
repent
error
shake
loose
from
the
life
:
it
be
a
still
quiver
part
of
himself
,
bring
shudder
and
bitter
flavor
and
the
tingling
of
a
merit
shame
.
  
<EOS>
into
this
second
life
Bulstrode
's
past
have
now
rise
,
only
the
pleasure
of
it
seem
to
have
lose
their
quality
.
 
<EOS>
night
and
day
,
without
interruption
save
of
brief
sleep
which
only
wove
retrospect
and
fear
into
a
fantastic
present
,
he
feel
the
scene
of
his
early
life
come
between
him
and
everything
else
,
as
obstinately
as
when
we
look
through
the
window
from
a
light
room
,
the
object
we
turn
our
back
on
be
still
before
us
,
instead
of
the
grass
and
the
tree
.
<EOS>
the
successive
event
inward
and
outward
be
there
in
one
view
:
though
each
may
be
dwell
on
in
turn
,
the
rest
still
keep
their
hold
in
the
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
once
more
he
see
himself
the
young
banker
's
clerk
,
with
an
agreeable
person
,
as
clever
in
figure
as
he
be
fluent
in
speech
and
fond
of
theological
definition
:
an
eminent
though
young
member
of
a
Calvinistic
dissent
church
at
Highbury
,
have
have
striking
experience
in
conviction
of
sin
and
sense
of
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
again
he
hear
himself
call
for
as
Brother
Bulstrode
in
prayer
meeting
,
speak
on
religious
platform
,
preach
in
private
house
.
 
<EOS>
again
he
feel
himself
think
of
the
ministry
as
possibly
his
vocation
,
and
incline
towards
missionary
labor
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
happy
time
of
his
life
:
that
be
the
spot
he
would
have
choose
now
to
awake
in
and
find
the
rest
a
dream
.
<EOS>
the
people
among
whom
Brother
Bulstrode
be
distinguish
be
very
few
,
but
they
be
very
near
to
him
,
and
stir
his
satisfaction
the
more
;
his
power
stretch
through
a
narrow
space
,
but
he
feel
its
effect
the
more
intensely
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
without
effort
in
the
peculiar
work
of
grace
within
him
,
and
in
the
sign
that
God
intend
him
for
special
instrumentality
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
moment
of
transition
;
it
be
with
the
sense
of
promotion
he
have
when
he
,
an
orphan
educate
at
a
commercial
charity
-
school
,
be
invite
to
a
fine
villa
belong
to
Mr.
Dunkirk
,
the
rich
man
in
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
soon
he
become
an
intimate
there
,
honor
for
his
piety
by
the
wife
,
mark
out
for
his
ability
by
the
husband
,
whose
wealth
be
due
to
a
flourishing
city
and
west
-
end
trade
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
setting
-
in
of
a
new
current
for
his
ambition
,
direct
his
prospect
of
"
instrumentality
"
towards
the
uniting
of
distinguished
religious
gift
with
successful
business
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
come
a
decide
external
leading
:
a
confidential
subordinate
partner
die
,
and
nobody
seem
to
the
principal
so
well
fitted
to
fill
the
severely
felt
vacancy
as
his
young
friend
Bulstrode
,
if
he
would
become
confidential
accountant
.
 
<EOS>
the
offer
be
accept
.
 
<EOS>
the
business
be
a
pawnbroker
's
,
of
the
most
magnificent
sort
both
in
extent
and
profit
;
and
on
a
short
acquaintance
with
it
Bulstrode
become
aware
that
one
source
of
magnificent
profit
be
the
easy
reception
of
any
good
offer
,
without
strict
inquiry
as
to
where
they
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
branch
house
at
the
west
end
,
and
no
pettiness
or
dinginess
to
give
suggestion
of
shame
.
  
<EOS>
He
remember
his
first
moment
of
shrink
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
private
,
and
be
fill
with
argument
;
some
of
these
take
the
form
of
prayer
.
<EOS>
the
business
be
establish
and
have
old
root
;
be
it
not
one
thing
to
set
up
a
new
gin
-
palace
and
another
to
accept
an
investment
in
an
old
one
?
 
<EOS>
the
profit
make
out
of
lose
soul
 
where
can
the
line
be
draw
at
which
they
begin
in
human
transaction
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
even
God
's
way
of
save
His
choose
?
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
knowest
,
"
 
the
young
Bulstrode
have
say
then
,
as
the
old
Bulstrode
be
say
now
 
"
Thou
knowest
how
loose
my
soul
sit
from
these
thing
 
how
I
view
them
all
as
implement
for
till
Thy
garden
rescue
here
and
there
from
the
wilderness
.
"
  
<EOS>
metaphor
and
precedent
be
not
want
;
peculiar
spiritual
experience
be
not
want
which
at
last
make
the
retention
of
his
position
seem
a
service
demand
of
him
:
the
vista
of
a
fortune
have
already
open
itself
,
and
Bulstrode
's
shrinking
remain
private
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Dunkirk
have
never
expect
that
there
would
be
any
shrinking
at
all
:
he
have
never
conceive
that
trade
have
anything
to
do
with
the
scheme
of
salvation
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
true
that
Bulstrode
find
himself
carry
on
two
distinct
life
;
his
religious
activity
could
not
be
incompatible
with
his
business
as
soon
as
he
have
argue
himself
into
not
feel
it
incompatible
.
  
<EOS>
mentally
surround
with
that
past
again
,
Bulstrode
have
the
same
plea
 
indeed
,
the
year
have
be
perpetually
spin
them
into
intricate
thickness
,
like
masse
of
spider
-
web
,
pad
the
moral
sensibility
;
nay
,
as
age
make
egoism
more
eager
but
less
enjoying
,
his
soul
have
become
more
saturated
with
the
belief
that
he
do
everything
for
God
's
sake
,
be
indifferent
to
it
for
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
 
if
he
could
be
back
in
that
far
-
off
spot
with
his
youthful
poverty
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
he
would
choose
to
be
a
missionary
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
train
of
cause
in
which
he
have
lock
himself
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
trouble
in
the
fine
villa
at
Highbury
.
 
<EOS>
year
before
,
the
only
daughter
have
run
away
,
defy
her
parent
,
and
go
on
the
stage
;
and
now
the
only
boy
die
,
and
after
a
short
time
Mr.
Dunkirk
die
also

the

a
simple
pious
woman

leave
with
all
the
wealth
in
and
out
of
the
magnificent
trade
,
of
which
she
never
know
the
precise
nature
,
have
come
to
believe
in
Bulstrode
,
and
innocently
adore
him
as

often
adore
their

<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
after
a
time
marriage
should
have
be
think
of
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Dunkirk
have
qualm
and
yearning
about
her
daughter
,
who
have
long
be
regard
as
lose
both
to

It

she

utterly
go
out

<EOS>
the

have
lose
her

imagine
a

and
wish
in
a
double
sense
to
reclaim
her
daughter

<EOS>
if
she
be
find
,
there
would
be
a
channel
for
property
 
perhaps
a
wide
one
 
in
the
provision
for
several
grandchild
.
 
<EOS>
effort
to
find
her
must
be
make
before
Mrs.
Dunkirk
would
marry
again
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
concur
;
but
after
advertisement
as
well
as
other
mode
of
inquiry
have
be
try
,
the
mother
believe
that
her
daughter
be
not
to
be
find
,
and
consent
to
marry
without
reservation
of
property
.
  
<EOS>
the
daughter
have
be
find
;
but
only
one
man
besides
Bulstrode
know
it
,
and
he
be
pay
for
keep
silence
and
carry
himself
away
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
bare
fact
which
Bulstrode
be
now
force
to
see
in
the
rigid
outline
with
which
act
present
themselves
onlooker
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
himself
at
that
distant
time
,
and
even
now
in
burn
memory
,
the
fact
be
break
into
little
sequence
,
each
justified
as
it
come
by
reasoning
which
seem
to
prove
it
righteous
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
's
course
up
to
that
time
have
,
he
think
,
be
sanction
by
remarkable
providence
,
appear
to
point
the
way
for
him
to
be
the
agent
in
make
the
good
use
of
a
large
property
and
withdraw
it
from
perversion
.
 
<EOS>
death
and
other
strike
disposition
,
such
as
feminine
trustfulness
,
have
come
;
and
Bulstrode
would
have
adopt
Cromwell
's
word
 
"
do
you
call
these
bare
event
?
 
<EOS>
the
Lord
pity
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
event
be
comparatively
small
,
but
the
essential
condition
be
there
 
namely
,
that
they
be
in
favor
of
his
own
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
him
to
settle
what
be
due
from
him
to
other
by
inquire
what
be
God
's
intention
with
regard
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
for
God
's
service
that
this
fortune
should
in
any
considerable
proportion
go
to
a
young
woman
and
her
husband
who
be
give
up
to
the
light
pursuit
,
and
may
scatter
it
abroad
in
triviality
 
people
who
seem
to
lie
outside
the
path
of
remarkable
providence
?
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
have
never
say
to
himself
beforehand
,
"
the
daughter
shall
not
be
find
"
 
nevertheless
when
the
moment
come
he
keep
her
existence
hide
;
and
when
other
moment
follow
,
he
soothe
the
mother
with
consolation
in
the
probability
that
the
unhappy
young
woman
may
be
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
hour
in
which
Bulstrode
feel
that
his
action
be
unrighteous
;
but
how
could
he
go
back
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
mental
exercise
,
call
himself
nought
,
lay
hold
on
redemption
,
and
go
on
in
his
course
of
instrumentality
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
five
year
death
again
come
to
widen
his
path
,
by
take
away
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
gradually
withdraw
his
capital
,
but
he
do
not
make
the
sacrifice
requisite
to
put
an
end
to
the
business
,
which
be
carry
on
for
thirteen
year
afterwards
before
it
finally
collapse
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
Nicholas
Bulstrode
have
use
his
hundred
thousand
discreetly
,
and
be
become
provincially
,
solidly
important
 
<EOS>
a
banker
,
a
Churchman
,
a
public
benefactor
;
also
a
sleep
partner
in
trading
concern
,
in
which
his
ability
be
direct
to
economy
in
the
raw
material
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
dye
which
rot
Mr.
Vincy
's
silk
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
this
respectability
have
last
undisturbed
for
nearly
thirty
year
 
when
all
that
precede
it
have
long
lain
benumb
in
the
consciousness
 
<EOS>
that
past
have
rise
and
immerse
his
thought
as
if
with
the
terrible
irruption
of
a
new
sense
overburthene
the
feeble
being
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
in
his
conversation
with
Raffles
,
he
have
learn
something
momentous
,
something
which
enter
actively
into
the
struggle
of
his
longing
and
terror
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
think
,
lie
an
opening
towards
spiritual
,
perhaps
towards
material
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
the
spiritual
kind
of
rescue
be
a
genuine
need
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
be
coarse
hypocrite
,
who
consciously
affect
belief
and
emotion
for
the
sake
of
gull
the
world
,
but
Bulstrode
be
not
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
simply
a
man
whose
desire
have
be
strong
than
his
theoretic
belief
,
and
who
have
gradually
explain
the
gratification
of
his
desire
into
satisfactory
agreement
with
those
belief
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
hypocrisy
,
it
be
a
process
which
show
itself
occasionally
in
us
all
,
to
whatever
confession
we
belong
,
and
whether
we
believe
in
the
future
perfection
of
our
race
or
in
the
near
date
fix
for
the
end
of
the
world
;
whether
we
regard
the
earth
as
a
putrefy
nidus
for
a
save
remnant
,
include
ourselves
,
or
have
a
passionate
belief
in
the
solidarity
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
the
service
he
could
do
to
the
cause
of
religion
have
be
through
life
the
ground
he
allege
to
himself
for
his
choice
of
action
:
it
have
be
the
motive
which
he
have
pour
out
in
his
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
who
would
use
money
and
position
better
than
he
mean
to
use
them
?
 
<EOS>
who
could
surpass
him
in
self
-
abhorrence
and
exaltation
of
God
's
cause
?
 
<EOS>
and
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
<EOS>
God
's
cause
be
something
distinct
from
his
own
rectitude
of
conduct
:
it
enforce
a
discrimination
of
God
's
enemy
,
who
be
to
be
use
merely
as
instrument
,
and
whom
it
would
be
as
well
if
possible
to
keep
out
of
money
and
consequent
influence
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
profitable
investment
in
trade
where
the
power
of
the
prince
of
this
world
show
its
most
active
device
,
become
sanctify
by
a
right
application
of
the
profit
in
the
hand
of
God
's
servant
.
  
<EOS>
this
implicit
reasoning
be
essentially
no
more
peculiar
to
evangelical
belief
than
the
use
of
wide
phrase
for
narrow
motive
<EOS>
be
peculiar
to
Englishmen
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
general
doctrine
which
be
not
capable
of
eat
out
our
morality
if
unchecked
by
the
deep
-
seated
habit
of
direct
fellow
-
feeling
with
individual
fellow
-
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
man
who
believe
in
something
else
than
his
own
greed
,
have
necessarily
a
conscience
or
standard
to
which
he
more
or
less
adapt
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
's
standard
have
be
his
serviceableness
to
God
's
cause
:
"
I
be
sinful
and
nought
 
<EOS>
a
vessel
to
be
consecrate
by
use
 
but
use
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
have
be
the
mould
into
which
he
have
constrain
his
immense
need
of
be
something
important
and
predominate
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
have
come
a
moment
in
which
that
mould
seem
in
danger
of
be
break
and
utterly
cast
away
.
  
<EOS>
what
if
the
act
he
have
reconcile
himself
to
because
they
make
him
a
strong
instrument
of
the
divine
glory
,
be
to
become
the
pretext
of
the
scoffer
,
and
a
darkening
of
that
glory
?
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
to
be
the
ruling
of
Providence
,
he
be
cast
out
from
the
temple
as
one
who
have
bring
unclean
offering
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
long
pour
out
utterance
of
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
but
today
a
repentance
have
come
which
be
of
a
bitterer
flavor
,
and
a
threaten
Providence
urge
him
to
a
kind
of
propitiation
which
be
not
simply
a
doctrinal
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
the
divine
tribunal
have
change
its
aspect
for
him
;
self
-
prostration
be
no
longer
enough
,
and
he
must
bring
restitution
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
really
before
his
God
that
Bulstrode
be
about
to
attempt
such
restitution
as
seem
possible
:
a
great
dread
have
seize
his
susceptible
frame
,
and
the
scorching
approach
of
shame
work
in
him
a
new
spiritual
need
.
 
<EOS>
night
and
day
,
while
the
resurgent
threatening
past
be
make
a
conscience
within
him
,
he
be
think
by
what
mean
he
could
recover
peace
and
trust
 
by
what
sacrifice
he
could
stay
the
rod
.
 
<EOS>
His
belief
in
these
moment
of
dread
be
,
that
if
he
spontaneously
do
something
right
,
God
would
save
him
from
the
consequence
of
wrong
-
doing
.
<EOS>
for
religion
can
only
change
when
the
emotion
which
fill
it
be
change
;
and
the
religion
of
personal
fear
remain
nearly
at
the
level
of
the
savage
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
see
Raffles
actually
go
away
on
the
brasse
coach
,
and
this
be
a
temporary
relief
;
it
remove
the
pressure
of
an
immediate
dread
,
but
do
not
put
an
end
to
the
spiritual
conflict
and
the
need
to
win
protection
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
come
to
a
difficult
resolve
,
and
write
a
letter
to
Will
Ladislaw
,
beg
him
to
be
at
the
Shrubs
that
evening
for
a
private
interview
at
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Will
have
feel
no
particular
surprise
at
the
request
,
and
connect
it
with
some
new
notion
about
the
"
Pioneer
;
"
but
when
he
be
show
into
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
private
room
,
he
be
strike
with
the
painfully
wear
look
on
the
banker
's
face
,
and
be
go
to
say
,
"
be
you
ill
?
"
<EOS>
when
,
check
himself
in
that
abruptness
,
he
only
inquire
after
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
and
her
satisfaction
with
the
picture
buy
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
she
be
quite
satisfied
;
she
have
go
out
with
her
daughter
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
you
to
come
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
because
I
have
a
communication
of
a
very
private
 
indeed
,
I
will
say
,
of
a
sacredly
confidential
nature
,
which
I
desire
to
make
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
I
dare
say
,
have
be
farther
from
your
thought
than
that
there
have
be
important
tie
in
the
past
which
could
connect
your
history
with
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
felt
something
like
an
electric
shock
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
already
in
a
state
of
keen
sensitiveness
and
hardly
allay
agitation
on
the
subject
of
tie
in
the
past
,
and
his
presentiment
be
not
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
like
the
fluctuation
of
a
dream
 
as
if
the
action
begin
by
that
loud
bloated
stranger
be
be
carry
on
by
this
pale
-
eyed
sickly
look
piece
of
respectability
,
whose
subdue
tone
and
glib
formality
of
speech
be
at
this
moment
almost
as
repulsive
to
him
as
their
remember
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
He
answer
,
with
a
marked
change
of
color
    
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
before
you
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
a
man
who
be
deeply
stricken
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
urgency
of
conscience
and
the
knowledge
that
I
be
before
the
bar
of
one
who
seeth
not
as
man
seeth
,
I
should
be
under
no
compulsion
to
make
the
disclosure
which
have
be
my
object
in
ask
you
to
come
here
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
human
law
go
,
you
have
no
claim
on
me
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
will
be
even
more
uncomfortable
than
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
pause
,
lean
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
look
at
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
now
fix
his
examine
glance
on
Will
and
say
    
"
I
be
tell
that
your
mother
's
name
be
Sarah
Dunkirk
,
and
that
she
run
away
from
her
friend
to
go
on
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
that
your
father
be
at
one
time
much
emaciate
by
illness
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
ask
if
you
can
confirm
these
statement
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
all
true
,
"
say
Will
,
strike
with
the
order
in
which
an
inquiry
have
come
,
that
may
have
be
expect
to
be
preliminary
to
the
banker
's
previous
hint
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
<EOS>
to
-
night
follow
the
order
of
his
emotion
;
he
entertain
no
doubt
that
the
opportunity
for
restitution
have
come
,
and
he
have
an
overpower
impulse
towards
the
penitential
expression
by
which
he
be
deprecate
chastisement
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
any
particular
of
your
mother
's
family
?
<EOS>
"
he
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
she
never
like
to
speak
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
very
generous
,
honorable
woman
,
"
say
Will
,
almost
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
allege
anything
against
her
.
 
<EOS>
do
she
never
mention
her
mother
to
you
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
her
say
that
she
think
her
mother
do
not
know
the
reason
of
her
run
away

<EOS>
She
say
"
poor
mother
"
in
a
pity
tone
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
mother
become
my
wife

"
say
Bulstrode
,
and
then
pause
a
moment
before
he
add
,
"
you
have
a
claim
on
me
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
:
as
I
say
before
,
not
a
legal

but
one
which
my

recognize

<EOS>
I
be
enrich
by

a

would
probably
not

take
place
 
certainly
not

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

say
Will

feel
suspicion

repugnance
rise
so
strongly
within
him

<EOS>
that
without
quite
know
what
he
do
,
he
take
his
hat
from
the
floor
and
stand
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
impulse
within
him
be
to
reject
the
disclose

<EOS>
"
pray
be
seat

Bulstrode
,
anxiously

<EOS>
"
doubtless
you
be
startle
by
the
suddenness
of
this
discovery

I
entreat
your
patience
with
one

already
bow
down

inward
trial

<EOS>
Will
reseat
himself
,
feel
some
pity
which
be
half
contempt
for
this
voluntary
self

abasement
of
an
elderly
man

"
It
be
my

Mr.

adequately

Mr.

pause
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
be
perform
a
strike
piece
of
scrupulosity
in
the
judgment
of
his
auditor
,
and
a
penitential
act
in
the
eye
of
God
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
clew
to
the
state
of
Will
Ladislaw
's
mind
,
smart
as
it
be
from
the
clear
hint
of
Raffles
,
and
with
its
natural
quickness
in
construction
stimulate
by
the
expectation
of
discovery
which
he
would
have
be
glad
to
conjure
back
into
darkness

<EOS>
Will
make
no

moment
,
till
Mr.

who
at
the
end
of
his

have
cast
his
eye
on
the
floor
,
now
raise
them
with
an
examine
glance
,
which
Will
meet
fully
,
say
    
"
I
suppose
you
do
know
of
my

's
existence

know
where
she
may
have

"
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
shrink
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
visible
quivering
in
his
face
and
hand
.
<EOS>
He
be
totally
unprepared
to
have
his
advance
meet
in
this
way
,
or
to
find
himself
urge
into
more
revelation
than
he
have
beforehand
set
down
as
needful
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
that
moment
he
dare
not
tell
a
lie
,
and
he
feel
suddenly
uncertain
of
his
ground
which
he
have
trodden
with
some
confidence
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
that
you
conjecture
rightly

he
answer
,
with
a
faltering
in
his
tone

"
and
I
wish
to
make
atonement
to
you

You

into

<EOS>
Mr.

have
go
on
to
particular
in
the
expectation
that
these
would
work
strongly
on
Ladislaw

merge
other
feeling
in
grateful
acceptance

Will
be
look
as
stubborn
as
possible

with
his
lip
pouting
and
his
finger
in
his
side

pocket

He
be
not
in

touched

say
firmly
,
    
"
before
I
make
any
reply

two

<EOS>
Mr.

's
thought
be
,
"
Raffles
have
tell
him
.

<EOS>
how
could
he
refuse
to
answer
when
he
have
volunteer
what
draw
forth
the
question
?
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
yes

be
that
business

be
it
not

<EOS>
Will
's
tone
have
a
cutting
bitterness
:
he
be
move
to
put
his
question
as
nakedly
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
redden
with
irrepressible
anger
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
prepare
for
a
scene
of
self
-
abasement
,
but
his
intense
pride
and
his
habit
of
supremacy
overpower
penitence
,
and
even
dread
,
when
this
young
man
,
whom
he
have
mean
to
benefit
,
turn
on
him
with
the
air
of
a
judge
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
business
be
establish
before
I
become
connected
with
it

it

an
inquiry
of

he
answer
,
not
raise
his
voice

but
speak
with
quick
defiantness

<EOS>
"
yes

Will

start
up
again
with
his

in
his

<EOS>
"
It
be
eminently
mine
to
ask
such
question

I
have
to
decide
whether
I

have
transaction

accept
your

now
I
find
there
be
a
stain

I

keep
as
clear

good

sir

"
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
be
go
to
speak
,
but
Will
,
with
determined
quickness
,
be
out
of
the
room
in
an
instant
,
and
in
another
the
hall
-
door
have
close
behind
him

<EOS>
He
be
too
strongly
possessed
with
passionate
rebellion
against
this
inherit
blot
which
have
be
thrust
on
his
knowledge
to
reflect
at
present
whether
he
have
not
be
too
hard
on
Bulstrode
 
too
arrogantly
merciless
towards
a
man
of
sixty
,
who
be
make
effort
at
retrieval
when
time
have
render
them
vain

<EOS>
no
third
person
listening
could
have
thoroughly
understand
the
impetuosity
of
Will
's
repulse
or
the
bitterness
of
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
but
himself
then
know
how
everything
connect
with
the
sentiment
of
his
own
dignity
have
an
immediate
bearing
for
him
on
his
relation
to
Dorothea
and
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
treatment
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
rush
of
impulse
by
which
he
fling
back
that
offer
of
Bulstrode
's
there
be
mingle
the
sense
that
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
him
ever
to
tell
Dorothea
that
he
have
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Bulstrode
 
when
Will
be
go
<EOS>
he
suffer
a
violent
reaction
,
and
weep
like
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
he
have
encounter
an
open
expression
of
scorn
from
any
man
high
than
raffle
;
and
with
that
scorn
hurrying
like
venom
through
his
system
,
there
be
no
sensibility
leave
to
consolation

<EOS>
but
the
relief
of
weeping
have
to
be
check

<EOS>
His
wife

daughter
soon
come
home
from
hear
the
address
of
an
oriental
missionary

be
full
of
regret
that

not
hear
,
in
the
first
instance
,
the
interesting
thing
which
they
try
to
repeat
to

<EOS>
perhaps
,
through
all
other
hide
thought
,
the
one
that
breathe
most
comfort
be
,
that
Will
Ladislaw
at

be
not
likely
to

<EOS>

wholly
bent

forthwith
quitting
Middlemarch

<EOS>
the
morning
after
his
agitate
scene
with
Bulstrode
<EOS>
he
write
a
brief
letter
to
her
,
say
that
various
cause
have
detain
him
in
the
neighborhood
longer
than
he
have
expect
,
and
ask
her
permission
to
call
again
at
Lowick
at
some
hour
which
she
would
mention
on
the
early
possible
day
,
he
be
anxious
to
depart
,
but
unwilling
to
do
so
until
she
have
grant
him
an
interview
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
the
letter
at
the
office
,
order
the
messenger
to
carry
it
to
Lowick
Manor
,
and
wait
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Ladislaw
feel
the
awkwardness
of
ask
for
more
last
word
.
 
<EOS>
His
former
farewell
have
be
make
in
the
hearing
of
Sir
James
Chettam
,
and
have
be
announce
as
final
even
to
the
butler
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
try
to
a
man
's
dignity
to
reappear
when
he
be
not
expect
to
do
so
:
a
first
farewell
have
pathos
in
it
,
but
to
come
back
for
a
second
lend
an
opening
to
comedy
,
and
it
be
possible
even
that
there
may
be
bitter
sneer
afloat
about
Will
's
motive
for
linger
.
 
<EOS>
still
it
be
on
the
whole
more
satisfactory
to
his
feeling
to
take
the
direct
mean
of
see
Dorothea
,
than
to
use
any
device
which
may
give
an
air
of
chance
to
a
meeting
of
which
he
wish
her
to
understand
that
it
be
what
he
earnestly
seek
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
part
from
her
before
,
he
have
be
in
ignorance
of
fact
which
give
a
new
aspect
to
the
relation
between
them
,
and
make
a
more
absolute
severance
than
he
have
then
believe
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
nothing
of
Dorothea
's
private
fortune
,
and
be
little
used
to
reflect
on
such
matter
,
take
it
for
grant
that
accord
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
arrangement
marriage
to
him
,
Will
Ladislaw
,
would
mean
that
she
consent
to
be
penniless
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
what
he
could
wish
for
even
in
his
secret
heart
,
or
even
if
she
have
be
ready
to
meet
such
hard
contrast
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
too
,
there
be
the
fresh
smart
of
that
disclosure
about
his
mother
's
family
,
which
if
know
would
be
an
add
reason
why
Dorothea
's
friend
should
look
down
upon
him
as
utterly
below
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
secret
hope
that
after
some
year
he
may
come
back
with
the
sense
that
he
have
at
least
a
personal
value
equal
to
her
wealth
,
seem
now
the
dreamy
continuation
of
a
dream
.
<EOS>
this
change
would
surely
justify
him
in
ask
Dorothea
to
receive
him
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
on
that
morning
be
not
at
home
to
receive
Will
's
note
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
a
letter
from
her
uncle
announce
his
intention
to
be
at
home
in
a
week
,
she
have
drive
first
to
Freshitt
to
carry
the
news
,
mean
to
go
on
to
the
grange
to
deliver
some
order
with
which
her
uncle
have
intrust
her
 
thinking
,
as
he
say
,
"
a
little
mental
occupation
of
this
sort
good
for
a
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
Will
Ladislaw
could
have
overhear
some
of
the
talk
at
Freshitt
that
morning
,
he
would
have
feel
all
his
supposition
confirm
as
to
the
readiness
of
certain
people
to
sneer
at
his
lingering
in
the
neighborhood
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
,
indeed
,
though
much
relieved
concern
Dorothea
,
have
be
on
the
watch
to
learn
Ladislaw
's
movement
,
and
have
an
instruct
informant
in
Mr.
Standish
,
who
be
necessarily
in
his
confidence
on
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
that
Ladislaw
have
stay
in
Middlemarch
nearly
two
month
after
he
have
declare
that
he
be
go
immediately
,
be
a
fact
to
embitter
Sir
James
's
suspicion
,
or
at
least
to
justify
his
aversion
to
a
"
young
fellow
"
whom
he
represent
to
himself
as
slight
,
volatile
,
and
likely
enough
to
show
such
recklessness
as
naturally
go
along
with
a
position
unrivete
by
family
tie
or
a
strict
profession
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
just
hear
something
from
Standish
which
,
while
it
justify
these
surmise
about
Will
,
offer
a
means
of
nullify
all
danger
with
regard
to
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
unwonted
circumstance
may
make
us
all
rather
unlike
ourselves
:
there
be
condition
under
which
the
most
majestic
person
be
oblige
to
sneeze
,
and
our
emotion
be
liable
to
be
act
on
in
the
same
incongruous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Good
Sir
James
be
this
morning
so
far
unlike
himself
that
he
be
irritably
anxious
to
say
something
to
Dorothea
on
a
subject
which
he
usually
avoid
as
if
it
have
be
a
matter
of
shame
to
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
use
Celia
as
a
medium
,
because
he
do
not
choose
that
she
should
know
the
kind
of
gossip
he
have
in
his
mind
;
and
before
Dorothea
happen
to
arrive
he
have
be
try
to
imagine
how
,
with
his
shyness
and
unready
tongue
,
he
could
ever
manage
to
introduce
his
communication
.
 
<EOS>
Her
unexpected
presence
bring
him
to
utter
hopelessness
in
his
own
power
of
say
anything
unpleasant
;
but
desperation
suggest
a
resource
;
he
send
the
groom
on
an
unsaddled
horse
across
the
park
with
a
pencilled
note
to
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
who
already
know
the
gossip
,
and
would
think
it
no
compromise
of
herself
to
repeat
it
as
often
as
require
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
detain
on
the
good
pretext
that
Mr.
Garth
,
whom
she
want
to
see
,
be
expect
at
the
hall
within
the
hour
,
and
she
be
still
talk
to
Caleb
on
the
gravel
when
Sir
James
,
on
the
watch
for
the
rector
's
wife
,
see
her
come
and
meet
her
with
the
needful
hint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
 
<EOS>
I
understand
,
"
 
say
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
such
a
blackamoor
that
I
can
not
smirch
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
that
it
be
of
any
consequence
,
"
say
Sir
James
,
dislike
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
should
understand
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
it
be
desirable
that
Dorothea
should
know
there
be
reason
why
she
should
not
receive
him
again
;
and
I
really
can
not
say
so
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
come
lightly
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
come
very
lightly
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
when
Dorothea
quit
Caleb
and
turn
to
meet
them
,
it
appear
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
have
step
across
the
park
by
the
mere
chance
in
the
world
,
just
to
chat
with
Celia
in
a
matronly
way
about
the
baby
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
Mr.
Brooke
be
come
back
?
<EOS>
delightful
!
 
<EOS>
come
back
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
quite
cure
of
parliamentary
fever
and
pioneering
.
 
<EOS>
Apropos
of
the
"
Pioneer
"
 
<EOS>
somebody
have
prophesy
that
it
would
soon
be
like
a

dolphin
,
and
turn
all
color
for
want
of
know
how

He

find
this
young

lie
on
the
rug

warble
at

with
indignant
energy

I
feel
sure
it

a
misrepresentation

I
will

much

<EOS>
Dorothea
when
thoroughly
move
care
little
what
any
one
think
of
her
feeling
;
and
even
if
she
have
be
able
to
reflect
,
she
would
have
hold
it
petty
to
keep
silence
at
injurious
word
about

at

Mrs.

equal

the
palm

outward

I

it

<EOS>
Sir

nothing

to
the

He
be
altogether
discontent
with
the

Dorothea
drive
along
between

the
tear

and

down

she
do

the

it

ugly

it

within
her

to
;

all
the
while
a
remembrance
to
which
there
have
always
cling
a
vague
uneasiness
would
thrust
itself
on
her
attention
 
the
remembrance
of
that
day
when
she
have
find
Will
Ladislaw
with

poor

inwardly

feel
a
strange
alternation
between
anger
with

the
passionate
defence
of
him

They
all
try
to
blacken
him
before

I
will
care
for

I

these
be
her
last
thought
before
she
feel
that
the
carriage
be
pass
under
the
archway
of

gate
at

when

her
handkerchief
to

of

<EOS>
the
coachman
beg
leave
to
take
out
the
horse
for
half
an
hour
as
there
be
something
wrong
with

shoe
;
and
Dorothea
,
have
the
sense
that
she
be
go
to
rest
,
take
off
her
glove
and
bonnet
,
while
she
be
lean
against
a
statue
in

and
talk
to
the
housekeeper

at

(

in
the
act
of
pack
his
movable

and
do
not

<EOS>
Dorothea
's
heart
seem
to
turn
over
as
if
it
have
have
a
blow
,
but
she
be
not
perceptibly
check
:
in
truth
,
the
sense
that
Will
be
there
be
for
the
moment
all
-
satisfy
to
her
,
like
the
sight
of
something
precious
that
one
have
lose
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
reach
the
door
she
say
to
Mrs.
Kell
    
"
go
in
first
,
and
tell
him
that
I

"
  
<EOS>
Will
have
find
his
portfolio
,
and
have
lay
it
on
the
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
to
turn
over
the
sketch
and
please
himself
by
look
at
the
memorable
piece
of
art
which
have
a
relation
to
nature
too
mysterious
for
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
smile
at
it
still
,
and
shake
the
sketch
into
order
with
the
thought
that
he
may
find
a
letter
from
her
await
him
at
Middlemarch
,
when
Mrs.
Kell
close
to
his
elbow
say
    
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Casaubon
be
come
in
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
turn
round
quickly
,
and
the
next
moment
Dorothea
be
enter
.
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Kell
close
the
door
behind
her
they
meet
:
each
be
look
at
the
other
,
and
consciousness
be
overflow
by
something
that
suppress
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
confusion
that
keep
them
silent
,
for
they
both
feel
that
parting
be
near
,
and
there
be
no
shamefacedness
in
a
sad
parting
.
  
<EOS>
She
move
automatically
towards
her
uncle
's
chair
against
the
writing
-
table
,
and
Will
,
after
draw
it
out
a
little
for
her
,
go
a
few
pace
off
and
stand
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
sit
down
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
cross
her
hand
on
her
lap
;
"
I
be
very
glad
you
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Will
think
that
her
face
look
just
as
it
do
when
she
first
shake
hand
with
him
in
Rome
;
for
her
widow
's
cap
,
fix
in
her
bonnet
,
have
go
off
with
it
,
and
he
could
see
that
she
have
lately
be
shed
tear
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
mixture
of
anger
in
her
agitation
have
vanish
at
the
sight
of
him
;
she
have
be
use
,
when
they
be
face
to
face
,
always
to
feel
confidence
and
the
happy
freedom
which
come
with
mutual
understanding
,
and
how
could
other
people
's
word
hinder
that
effect
on
a
sudden
?
 
<EOS>
let
the
music
which
can
take
possession
of
our
frame
and
fill
the
air
with
joy
for
us
,
sound
once
more
 
<EOS>
what
do
it
signify
that
we
hear
it
find
fault
with
in
its
absence
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
send
a
letter

Lowick
Manor

day

you

himself
opposite
to
her

away
immediately
,

I
could
not

without
speak
to
you

<EOS>
"
I
think
we
have
part
when
you
come
to
Lowick
many
week
ago

you

go
then
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
her
voice
tremble
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
be
in
ignorance
then
of
thing
which
I
know
now
 
thing
which
have
alter
my
feeling
about
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
you
before
,
I
be
dream
that
I
may
come
back
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
ever
shall
 
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Will
pause
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
me
to
know
the
reason
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Will
,
impetuously
,
shake
his
head
backward
,
and
look
away
from
her
with
irritation
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
must
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
grossly
insult
in
your
eye
and
in
the
eye
of
other
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
mean
implication
against
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
know
that
under
no
circumstance
would
I
have
lower
myself
by
 
under
no
circumstance
<EOS>
would
I
have
give
man
the
chance
of
say
that
I
seek
money
under
the
pretext
of
seek
 
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
other
safeguard
against
me
 
the
safeguard
of
wealth
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Will
rise
from
his
chair
with
the
last
word
and
go
 
he
hardly
know
where
;
but
it
be
to
the
projecting
window
near
him
,
which
have
be
open
as
now
about
the
same
season
a
year
ago
,
when
he
and
Dorothea
have
stand
within
it
and
talk
together
.
 
<EOS>
Her
whole
heart
be
go
out
at
this
moment
in
sympathy
with
Will
's
indignation
:
she
only
want
to
convince
him
that
she
have
never
do
him
injustice
,
and
he
seem
to
have
turn
away
from
her
as
if
she
too
have
be
part
of
the
unfriendly
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
unkind
of
you
to
suppose
that
I
ever
attribute
any
meanness
to
you
,
"
she
begin
.
 
<EOS>
then
in
her
ardent
way
,
want
to
plead
with
him
,
she
move
from
her
chair
and
go
in
front
of
him
to
her
old
place
in
the
window
,
say
,
"
do
you
suppose
that
I
ever
disbelieve
in
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
when
Will
see
her
there
,
he
give
a
start
and
move
backward
out
of
the
window
,
without
meet
her
glance
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
hurt
by
this
movement
follow
up
the
previous
anger
of
his
tone
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
ready
to
say
that
it
be
as
hard
on
her
as
on
him
,
and
that
she
be
helpless
;
but
those
strange
particular
of
their
relation
which
neither
of
them
could
explicitly
mention
keep
her
always
in
dread
of
say
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
she
have
no
belief
that
Will
would
in
any
case
have
want
to
marry
her
,
and
she
fear
use
word
which
may
imply
such
a
belief
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
say
earnestly
,
recur
to
his
last
word
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
no
safeguard
be
ever
need
against
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Will
do
not
answer
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
stormy
fluctuation
of
his
feeling
these
word
of
her
seem
to
him
cruelly
neutral
,
and
he
look
pale
and
miserable
after
his
angry
outburst
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
table
and
fasten
up
his
portfolio
,
while
Dorothea
look
at
him
from
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
waste
these
last
moment
together
in
wretched
silence
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
he
say
,
since
what
have
get
obstinately
uppermost
in
his
mind
be
the
passionate
love
for
her
which
he
forbid
himself
to
utter
?
 
<EOS>
what
could
she
say
,
since
she
may
offer
him
no
help
 
since
she
be
force
to
keep
the
money
that
ought
to
have
be
his
?
 
<EOS>
since
to
-
day
he
seem
not
to
respond
as
he
use
to
do
to
her
thorough
trust
and
liking
?
  
<EOS>
but
Will
at
last
turn
away
from
his
portfolio
and
approach
the
window
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
"
he
say
,
with
that
peculiar
look
of
the
eye
which
sometimes
accompany
bitter
feeling
,
as
if
they
have
be
tired
and
burn
with
gaze
too
close
at
a
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
you
do
in
life
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
timidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
your
intention
remain
just
the
same
as
when
we
say
good
-
by
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Will
,
in
a
tone
that
seem
to
waive
the
subject
as
uninteresting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
work
away
at
the
first
thing
that
offer
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
one
get
a
habit
of
do
without
happiness
or
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
sad
word
!
<EOS>
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
a
dangerous
tendency
to
sob
.
<EOS>
then
try
to
smile
,
she
add
,
"
We
use
to
agree
that
we
be
alike
in
speak
too
strongly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
speak
too
strongly
now
,
"
say
Will
,
lean
back
against
the
angle
of
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
certain
thing
which
a
man
can
only
go
through
once
in
his
life
;
and
he
must
know
some
time
or
other
that
the
good
be
over
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
experience
have
happen
to
me
while
I
be
very
young
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
care
more
for
than
I
can
ever
care
for
anything
else
be
absolutely
forbid
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
merely
by
be
out
of
my
reach
,
but
forbid
me
,
even
if
it
be
within
my
reach
,
by
my
own
pride
and
honor
 
by
everything
I
respect
myself
for
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
go
on
live
as
a
man
may
do
who
have
see
heaven
in
a
trance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
pause
,
imagine
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
Dorothea
to
misunderstand
this
;
indeed
he
feel
that
he
be
contradict
himself
and
offend
against
his
self
-
approval
in
speak
to
her
so
plainly
;
but
still
 
it
could
not
be
fairly
call
woo
a
woman
to
tell
her
that
he
would
never
woo
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
admit
to
be
a
ghostly
kind
of
woo
.
  
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
's
mind
be
rapidly
go
over
the
past
with
quite
another
vision
than
his
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
that
she
herself
may
be
what
Will
most
care
for
do
throb
through
her
an
instant
,
but
then
come
doubt
:
the
memory
of
the
little
they
have
live
through
together
turn
pale
and
shrink
before
the
memory
which
suggest
how
much
full
may
have
be
the
intercourse
between
Will
and
some
one
else
with
whom
he
have
have
constant
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
he
have
say
may
refer
to
that
other
relation
,
and
whatever
have
pass
between
him
and
herself
be
thoroughly
explain
by
what
she
have
always
regard
as
their
simple
friendship
and
the
cruel
obstruction
thrust
upon
it
by
her
husband
's
injurious
act
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
stand
silent
,
with
her
eye
cast
down
dreamily
,
while
image
crowd
upon
her
which
leave
the
sickening
certainty
that
Will
be
refer
to
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
sickening
?
<EOS>
He
want
her
to
know
that
here
too
his
conduct
should
be
above
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
will
be
not
surprised
at
her
silence
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
also
be
tumultuously
busy
while
he
watch
her
,
and
he
be
feel
rather
wildly
that
something
must
happen
to
hinder
their
parting
 
<EOS>
some
miracle
,
clearly
nothing
in
their
own
deliberate
speech
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
have
she
any
love
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
pretend
to
himself
that
he
would
rather
believe
her
to
be
without
that
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
deny
that
a
secret
longing
for
the
assurance
that
she
love
him
be
at
the
root
of
all
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
neither
of
them
know
how
long
they
stand
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
raise
her
eye
,
and
be
about
to
speak
,
when
the
door
open
and
her
footman
come
to
say
    
"
the
horse
be
ready
,
madam
,
whenever
you
like
to
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
presently
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Will
,
she
say
,
"
I
have
some
memorandum
to
write
for
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
"
say
Will
,
when
the
door
have
close
again
 
advance
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
I
shall
leave
Middlemarch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
act
in
every
way
rightly
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
in
a
low
tone
,
feel
a
pressure
at
her
heart
which
make
it
difficult
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
,
and
Will
take
it
for
an
instant
without
speak
,
for
her
word
have
seem
to
him
cruelly
cold
and
unlike
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Their
eye
meet
,
but
there
be
discontent
in
his
,
and
in
her
there
be
only
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
away
and
take
his
portfolio
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
do
you
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
please
remember
me
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
repress
a
rise
sob
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
say
that
?
"
say
Will
,
with
irritation
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
if
I
be
not
in
danger
of
forget
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
really
a
movement
of
anger
against
her
at
that
moment
,
and
it
impel
him
to
go
away
without
pause
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
flash
to
Dorothea
 
<EOS>
his
last
word
 
<EOS>
his
distant
bow
to
her
as
he
reach
the
door
 
<EOS>
the
sense
that
he
be
no
longer
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
sink
into
the
chair
,
and
for
a
few
moment
sit
like
a
statue
,
while
image
and
emotion
be
hurry
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
Joy
come
first
,
in
spite
of
the
threaten
train
behind
it
 
joy
in
the
impression
that
it
be
really
herself
whom
Will
love
and
be
renounce
,
that
there
be
really
no
other
love
<EOS>
less
permissible
,
more
blameworthy
,
which
honor
be
hurry
him
away
from
.
<EOS>
They
be
part
all
the
same
,
but
 
Dorothea
draw
a
deep
breath
and
feel
her
strength
return
 
she
could
think
of
him
unrestrainedly
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
parting
be
easy
to
bear
:
the
first
sense
of
love
and
be
love
exclude
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
some
hard
icy
pressure
have
melt
,
and
her
consciousness
have
room
to
expand
:
her
past
be
come
back
to
her
with
large
interpretation
.
 
<EOS>
the
joy
be
not
the
less
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
the
more
complete
just
then
 
because
of
the
irrevocable
parting
;
for
there
be
no
reproach
,
no
contemptuous
wonder
to
imagine
in
any
eye
or
from
any
lip
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
act
so
as
to
defy
reproach
,
and
make
wonder
respectful
.
  
<EOS>
any
one
watch
her
may
have
see
that
there
be
a
fortifying
thought
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
when
inventive
power
be
work
with
glad
ease
some
small
claim
on
the
attention
be
fully
meet
as
if
it
be
only
a
cranny
open
to
the
sunlight
,
it
be
easy
now
for
Dorothea
to
write
her
memorandum
.
 
<EOS>
She
speak
her
last
word
to
the
housekeeper
in
cheerful
tone
,
and
when
she
seat
herself
in
the
carriage
<EOS>
her
eye
be
bright
and
her
cheek
bloom
under
the
dismal
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
She
throw
back
the
heavy
"
weeper
,
"
and
look
before
her
,
wonder
which
road
Will
have
take
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
her
nature
to
be
proud
that
he
be
blameless
,
and
through
all
her
feeling
there
run
this
vein
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
right
to
defend
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
coachman
be
use
to
drive
his
gray
at
a
good
pace
,
Mr.
Casaubon
be
unenjoye
and
impatient
in
everything
away
from
his
desk
,
and
want
to
get
to
the
end
of
all
journey
;
and
Dorothea
be
now
bowl
along
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
driving
be
pleasant
,
for
rain
in
the
night
have
lay
the
dust
,
and
the
blue
sky
look
far
off
,
away
from
the
region
of
the
great
cloud
that
sail
in
masse
.
 
<EOS>
the
earth
look
like
a
happy
place
under
the
vast
heaven
,
and
Dorothea
be
wish
that
she
may
overtake
Will
and
see
him
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
turn
of
the
road
,
there
he
be
with
the
portfolio
under
his
arm
;
but
the
next
moment
she
be
pass
him
while
he
raise
his
hat
,
and
she
feel
a
pang
at
be
seat
there
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
,
leave
him
behind
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
look
back
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
a
crowd
of
indifferent
object
have
thrust
them
asunder
,
and
force
them
along
different
path
,
take
them
farther
and
farther
away
from
each
other
,
and
make
it
useless
to
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
no
more
make
any
sign
that
would
seem
to
say
,
"
need
we
part
?
<EOS>
"
than
she
could
stop
the
carriage
to
wait
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
what
a
world
of
reason
crowd
upon
her
against
any
movement
of
her
thought
towards
a
future
that
may
reverse
the
decision
of
this
day
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
I
have
know
before
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
know
 
<EOS>
then
we
could
be
quite
happy
in
thinking
of
each
other
,
though
we
be
forever
part
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
could
but
have
give
him
the
money
,
and
make
thing
easy
for
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
be
the
longing
that
come
back
the
most
persistently
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
so
heavily
do
the
world
weigh
on
her
in
spite
of
her
independent
energy
,
that
with
this
idea
of
Will
as
in
need
of
such
help
and
at
a
disadvantage
with
the
world
,
there
come
always
the
vision
of
that
unfittingness
of
any
close
relation
between
them
which
lie
in
the
opinion
of
every
one
connect
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
to
the
full
all
the
imperativeness
of
the
motive
which
urge
Will
's
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
he
dream
of
her
defy
the
barrier
that
her
husband
have
place
between
them
?
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
ever
say
to
herself
that
she
would
defy
it
?
  
<EOS>
Will
's
certainty
as
the
carriage
grow
small
in
the
distance
,
have
much
more
bitterness
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
very
slight
matter
be
enough
to
gall
him
in
his
sensitive
mood
,
and
the
sight
of
Dorothea
drive
past
him
while
he
feel
himself
plod
along
as
a
poor
devil
seek
a
position
in
a
world
which
in
his
present
temper
offer
him
little
that
he
covet
,
make
his
conduct
seem
a
mere
matter
of
necessity
,
and
take
away
the
sustainment
of
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
have
no
assurance
that
she
love
him
:
could
any
man
pretend
that
he
be
simply
glad
in
such
a
case
to
have
the
suffering
all
on
his
own
side
?
  
<EOS>
that
evening
Will

with

Lydgates

the

Mr.

none

there
be
an

Mr.

with
a
slight
touch

there

<EOS>
this
be
not

that
Mr.
Farebrother
have
hear
hint
of
Lydgate
's
expense
be
obviously
too
great
to
be
meet
by
his
practice
,
but
he
think
it
not
unlikely
that
there
be
resource
or
expectation
which
excuse
the
large
outlay
at
the
time
of
Lydgate
's
marriage

and
which
may
hinder
any
bad
consequence
from
the
disappointment

<EOS>
one
evening
,
when
he
take
the
pain
to
go
to
Middlemarch
on
purpose
to
have
a
chat
with
Lydgate
as
of
old
,
he
notice
in
him
an
air
of
excited
effort
quite
unlike
his
usual
easy
way
of
keep
silence
or
break
it
with
abrupt
energy
whenever
he
have
anything
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
talk
persistently
when
they
be
in
his
work
-
room
,
put
argument
for
and
against
the
probability
of
certain
biological
view
;
but
he
have
none
of
those
definite
thing
to
say
or
to
show
which
give
the
waymark
of
a
patient
uninterrupted
pursuit
,
such
as
he
use
himself
to
insist
on
,
say
that
"
there
must
be
a
systole
and
diastole
in
all
inquiry
,
"
and
that
"
a

be
continually
expand
and
shrink
between
the
whole
human
horizon

the
horizon
of

object

glass
.
<EOS>
"
that
evening
he
seem
to
be
talk
widely
for
the
sake
of
resist
any
personal
bearing
;
and
before
long
they
go
into
the
drawing
room
,
where
Lydgate
,
have
ask
Rosamond
to
give
them
music

sink
back
in
his
chair
in
silence

with

in

"
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
him
that
Lydgate
's
marriage
be
not
delightful
:
he
believe
,
as
the
rest
do
,
that
Rosamond
be
an
amiable
,
docile
creature
,
though
he
have
always
think
her
rather
uninteresting
 
a
little
too
much
the
pattern
-
card
of
the
finish
-
school
;
and
his
mother
could
not
forgive
Rosamond
because
she
never
seem
to
see
that
Henrietta
Noble
be
in
the

however
,
Lydgate
fall
in
love
with
her

say
the
Vicar
to
himself

and
she
must
be
to
his
taste

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
be
aware
that
Lydgate
be
a
proud
man
,
but
have
very
little
corresponding
fibre
in
himself
,
and
perhaps
too
little
care
about
personal
dignity
,
except
the
dignity
of
not
be
mean
or
foolish
,
he
could
hardly
allow
enough
for
the
way
in
which
Lydgate
shrink
,
as
from
a
burn
,
from
the
utterance
of
any
word
about
his
private
affair
.
 
<EOS>
and
soon
after
that
conversation
at
Mr.
Toller
's
,
the
Vicar
learn
something
which
make
him
watch
the
more
eagerly
for
an
opportunity
of
indirectly
let
Lydgate
know
that
if
he
want
to
open
himself
about
any
difficulty
there
be
a
friendly
ear
ready
.
  
<EOS>
the
opportunity
come
at
Mr.
Vincy
's
,
where
,
on
New
Year
's
day
,
there
be
a
party
,
to
which
Mr.
Farebrother
be
irresistibly
invite
,
on
the
plea
that
he
must
not
forsake
his
old
friend
on
the
first
new
year
of
his
be
a
great
man
,
and
Rector
as
well
as
Vicar
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
party
be
thoroughly
friendly
<EOS>
:
all
the
lady
of
the
Farebrother
family
be
present
;
the
Vincy
child
all
dine
at
the
table
,
and
Fred
have
persuade
his
mother
that
if
she
do
not
invite
Mary
Garth
,
the
farebrother
would
regard
it
as
a
slight
to
themselves
,
Mary
be
their
particular
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
come
,
and
Fred
be
in
high
spirit
,
though
his
enjoyment
be
of
a
checker
kind
 
triumph
that
his
mother
should
see
Mary
's
importance
with
the
chief
personage
in
the
party
be
much
streak
with
jealousy
when
Mr.
Farebrother
sit
down
by
her
.
<EOS>
Fred
use
to
be
much
more
easy
about
his
own
accomplishment
in
the
day
when
he
have
not
begin
to
dread
be
"
bowl
out
by
Farebrother
,
"
and
this
terror
be
still
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vincy
,
in
her
full
matronly
bloom
,
look
at
Mary
's
little
figure
,
rough
wavy
hair
,
and
visage
quite
without
lily
and
rose
,
and
wonder
;
try
unsuccessfully
to
fancy
herself
care
about
Mary
's
appearance
in
wedding
clothe
,
or
feel
complacency
in
grandchild
who
would
"
feature
"
the
Garths
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
party
be
a
merry
one
,
and
Mary
be
particularly
bright
;
be
glad
,
for
Fred
's
sake
,
that
his
friend
be
get
kind
to
her
,
and
be
also
quite
willing
that
they
should
see
how
much
she
be
value
by
other
whom
they
must
admit
to
be
judge
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
notice
that
Lydgate
seem
bored
,
and
that
Mr.
Vincy
speak
as
little
as
possible
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
perfectly
graceful
and
calm
,
and
only
a
subtle
observation
such
as
the
Vicar
have
not
be
rouse
to
bestow
on
her
would
have
perceive
the
total
absence
of
that
interest
in
her
husband
's
presence
which
a
love
wife
be
sure
to
betray
,
even
if
etiquette
keep
her
aloof
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
Lydgate
be
take
part
in
the
conversation
,
she
never
look
towards
him
any
more
than
if
she
have
be
a
sculptured
Psyche
model
to
look
another
way
:
and
when
,
after
be
call
out
for
an
hour
or
two
,
he
re
-
enter
the
room
,
she
seem
unconscious
of
the
fact
,
which
eighteen
month
before
would
have
have
the
effect
of
a
numeral
before
cipher
.
 
<EOS>
in
reality
,
however
,
she
be
intensely
aware
of
Lydgate
's
voice
and
movement
;
and
her
pretty
good
-
temper
air
of
unconsciousness
be
a
studied
negation
by
which
she
satisfy
her
inward
opposition
to
him
without
compromise
of
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
lady
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
after
Lydgate
have
be
call
away
from
the
dessert
,
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
when
Rosamond
happen
to
be
near
her
,
say
 
"
You
have
to
give
up
a
great
deal
of
your
husband
's
society
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
the
life
of
a
medical
man
be
very
arduous
:
especially
when
he
be
so
devoted
to
his
profession
as
Mr.
Lydgate
be
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
who
be
stand
,
and
move
easily
away
at
the
end
of
this
correct
little
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
dreadfully
dull
for
her
when
there
be
no
company
,
"
say
Mrs.
Vincy
,
who
be
seat
at
the
old
lady
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
think
so
when
Rosamond
be
ill
,
and
I
be
stay
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
our
be
a
cheerful
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
of
a
cheerful
disposition
myself
,
and
Mr.
Vincy
always
like
something
to
be
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
Rosamond
have
be
use
to
.
 
<EOS>
very
different
from
a
husband
out
at
odd
hour
,
and
never
know
when
he
will
come
home
,
and
of
a
close
,
proud
disposition
,

<EOS>
I

think
"
 
<EOS>
indiscreet
Mrs.
Vincy
do
lower
her
tone
slightly
with
this
parenthesis
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
Rosamond
always
have
an
angel
of
a
temper
;
her
brother
use
very
often
not
to
please
her
,
but
she
be
never
the
girl
to
show
temper
;
from
a
baby
she
be
always
as
good
as
good
,
and
with
a
complexion
beyond
anything
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
child
be
all
good
-
temper
,
thank
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
easily
credible
to
any
one
look
at
Mrs.
Vincy
as
she
throw
back
her
broad
cap
-
string
,
and
smile
towards
her
three
little
girl
,
age
from
seven
to
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
that
smile
glance
she
be
oblige
to
include
Mary
Garth
,
whom
the
three
girl
have
get
into
a
corner
to
make
her
tell
them
story
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
just
finish
the
delicious
tale
of
Rumpelstiltskin
,
which
she
have
well
by
heart
,
because
Letty
be
never
tired
of
communicate
it
to
her
ignorant
elder
from
a
favorite
red
volume
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
,
Mrs.
Vincy
's
darling
,
now
run
to
her
with
wide
-
eyed
serious
excitement
,
cry
,
"
oh
mamma
,
mamma
,
the
little
man
stamp
so
hard
on
the
floor
<EOS>
he
could
not

out
again

<EOS>
"

you

tell
me
all
about

"
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
her
eye
follow
Louisa
back
towards
the
attractive
corner
,
she
think
that
if
Fred
wish
her
to
invite
Mary
again
she
would
make
no
objection
,
the
child
be
so
pleased
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
presently
the
corner
become
still
more
animate
,
for
Mr.
Farebrother
come
in
,
and
seat
himself
behind
Louisa
,
take
her
on
his
lap
;
whereupon
the
girl
all
insist
that
he
must
hear
Rumpelstiltskin
,
and
Mary
must
tell
it
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
insist
too
,
and
Mary
,
without
fuss
,
begin
again
in
her
neat
fashion
,
with
precisely
the
same
word
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
,
who
have
also
seat
himself
near
,
would
have
feel
unmixed
triumph
in
Mary
's
effectiveness
if
Mr.
Farebrother
have
not
be
look
at
her
with
evident
admiration
,
while
he
dramatize
an
intense
interest
in
the
tale
to
please
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
care
any
more
about
my
one

eyed
giant

say
Fred
at
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

I
shall

<EOS>
tell
about
him
now

say
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
dare
say
;
I
be
quite
cut
out

<EOS>
ask
Mr.
Farebrother

<EOS>
"
yes

add
Mary

Mr.

down

up

up
his

falteringly

how

Louisa
take
the
affair
rather
seriously

get
down
from

go
to
Fred

<EOS>
"
ah

I

it

Day

Mr.
Farebrother
,
rise
and
walk
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
discover
of
late
that
Fred
have
become
jealous
of
him
,
and
also
that
he
himself
be
not
lose
his
preference
for
Mary
above
all
other
woman

a
delightful

Mrs.

I

Mrs.

decisively

I
like
her
countenance

for
beauty

I

the

a
little
sharp
in
her
tone
,
have
a
prospective
reference
to
<EOS>
Mary
be
become
her
daughter

in

for
there
be
this
inconvenience
in
Mary
's
position
with
regard
to
Fred
,
that
it
be
not
suitable
to
be
make
public
,
and
hence
the
three

at
Lowick
Parsonage
be
still
hope
that
Camden
would
choose
Miss

new

Mr.

play
a

to
satisfy
his
mother

who
regard
her
occasional
whist
as
a
protest
against
scandal

novelty
of
opinion

in
which
light
even

at

end
he

coldly

you

have
the
pleasure

I
do

I

I
can
not

Lydgate

lean
his

show
no

It

pay
me
the
compliment

say

very
glad
I
have
the

though
you
have
come
across
his
tactic

have
praise
me
up
as
a

contemptuously

well
,
I
be
glad
of
the
leakiness

I
do

you
certainly
have
do

rather
a
strong
check

self

complacency
to
find
how
much
of
one
's
right
do
depend
on
not

money

a

will
not

tempt
to

the
Lord

backward
to
please
the

I
do
not

get
it
in

it
be
pretty
sure
to
come
by
chance

<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
think
he
could
account
for
this
speech
,
in
strike
contrast
with
Lydgate
's
former
way
of
talk
,
as
the
perversity
which
will
often
spring
from
the
moodiness
of
a
man
ill
at
ease
in
his
affair

<EOS>
He
answer
in
a
tone
of
good

humored
admission
    
<EOS>
"
ah
,
there
be
enormous
patience
want
with
the
way
of
the
world

<EOS>
but
it
be
the
easy
for
a
man
to
wait
patiently
when
he
have
friend
who
love
him

and
ask
for
nothing
well
than
to
help
him
through

so
far
as
it
lie
in
their
power

Mr.

be
too
keen
a

not

the

there

with
his

would

time

look

<EOS>
naturally
,
the
merry
Christmas
bring
the
happy
New
Year
,
when
fellow
-
citizen
expect
to
be
pay
for
the
trouble
and
good
they
have
smilingly
bestow
on
their
neighbor
,
have
so
tighten
the
pressure
of
sordid
care
on
Lydgate
's
mind
that
it
be
hardly
possible
for
him
to
think
unbrokenly
of
any
other
subject
,
even
the
most
habitual
and
soliciting
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
an
ill
-
tempered
man
;
his
intellectual
activity
,
the
ardent
kindness
of
his
heart
,
as
well
as
his
strong
frame
,
would
always
,
under
tolerably
easy
condition
,
have
keep
him
above
the
petty
uncontrolled
susceptibility
which
make
bad
temper
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
now
a
prey
to
that
bad
irritation
which
arise
not
simply
from
annoyance
,
but
from
the
second
consciousness
underlie
those
annoyance
,
of
waste
energy
and
a
degrade
preoccupation
,
which
be
the
reverse
of
all
his
former
purpose

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
this

what
I
be
think

_
that

I

"
be
the
bitter
incessant
murmur
within
him
,
make
every
difficulty
a
double
goad
to
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
some
gentleman
have
make
an
amazing
figure
in
literature
by
general
discontent
with
the
universe
as
a
trap
of
dulness
into
which
their
great
soul
have
fall
by
mistake
;
but
the
sense
of
a
stupendous
self
and
an
insignificant
world
may
have
its
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
discontent
be
much
hard
to
bear
:
it
be
the
sense
that
there
be
a
grand
existence
in
thought
and
effective
action
lie
around
him
,
while
his
self
be
be
narrow
into
the
miserable
isolation
of
egoistic
fear
,
and
vulgar
anxiety
for
event
that
may
allay
such
fear
.
<EOS>
His
trouble
will
perhaps
appear
miserably
sordid
,
and
beneath
the
attention
of
lofty
person
who
can
know
nothing
of
debt
except
on
a
magnificent
scale
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
they
be
sordid
;
and
for
the
majority
,
who
be
not
lofty
,
there
be
no
escape
from
sordidness
but
by
be
free
from
money
-
craving
,
with
all
its
base
hope
and
temptation
,
its
watching
for
death
,
its
hint
request
,
its
horse
-
dealer
's
desire
to
make
bad
work
pass
for
good
,
<EOS>
its
seeking
for
function
which
ought
to
be
another
's
,
its
compulsion
often
to
long
for
Luck
in
the
shape
of
a
wide
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
because
Lydgate
writhe
under
the
idea
of
get
his
neck
beneath
this
vile
yoke
that
he
have
fall
into
a
bitter
moody
state
which
be
continually
widen
Rosamond
's
alienation
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
first
disclosure
about
the
bill
of
sale
,
he
have
make
many
effort
to
draw
her
into
sympathy
with
him
about
possible
measure
for
narrow
their
expense
,
and
with
the
threatening
approach
of
Christmas
his
proposition
grow
more
and
more
definite
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
two
can
do
with
only
one
servant
,
and
live
on
very
little
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
I
shall
manage
with
one
horse
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
Lydgate
,
as
we
have
see
,
have
begin
to
reason
,
with
a
more
distinct
vision
,
about
the
expense
of
living
,
and
any
share
of
pride
he
have
give
to
appearance
of
that
sort
be
meagre
compare
with
the
pride
which
make
him
revolt
from
exposure
as
a
debtor
,
or
from
ask
man
to
help
him
with
their
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
can
dismiss
the
other
two
servant
,
if
you
like

"
say
Rosamond
;
"

I
should
have
think

My

it
be
not

We

begin
too
expensively

Peacock

you
know
,
live
in

much
small
house

this

It
be
my

I
ought

know
better

I
deserve
a
thrashing

there
be
anybody

have
a
right

give

for
bring
you
into
the
necessity

we

pull
along

get
well

put
down
that
work

come
to
me

<EOS>
He
be
really
in
chill
gloom
about
her
at
that
moment
,
but
he
dread
a
future
without
affection
,
and
be
determined
to
resist
the
oncoming
of
division
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
obey
him
,
and
he
take
her
on
his
knee
,
but
in
her
secret
soul
she
be
utterly
aloof
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
see
only
that
the
world
be
not
order
to
her
liking
,
and
Lydgate
be
part
of
that
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
hold
her
waist
with
one
hand
and
lay
the
other
gently
on
both
of
her
;
for
this
rather
abrupt
man
have
much
tenderness
in
his
manner
towards
woman
,
seem
to
have
always
present
in
his
imagination
the
weakness
of
their
frame
and
the
delicate
poise
of
their
health
both
in
body
and
mind
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
begin
again
to
speak
persuasively
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
,
now
I
look
into
thing
a
little
,
Rosy
,
that
it
be
wonderful
what
an
amount
of
money
slip
away
in
our
housekeeping
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
servant
be
careless
,
and
we
have
have
a
great
many
people
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
must
be
many
in
our
rank
who
manage
with
much
less

:
they
must
do
with
commoner
thing

I
suppose
,

look
after
the
scrap

It
seem
,
money
go
but
a
little
way
in
these
matter
,
for
Wrench
have
everything
as
plain
as
possible

he
have
a
very
large
practice

<EOS>
"
oh
,
if
you
think
of
live
as
the
Wrenches
do
!

Rosamond
,
with
a
little
turn
of
her
neck

have
hear
you
express
your

yes

why
should

Mr.

have

should
be
more
careful
not

should
send
out
medicine

do

be
sure
you
begin
well

you
get
several
good
house

can
not
answer
to
be
eccentric

you
should
think
what
will
be
generally

Rosamond

in
a
decide
little
tone
of
admonition

Lydgate
's
anger
rise
:
<EOS>
he
be
prepared
to
be
indulgent
towards
feminine
weakness
,
but
not
towards
feminine
dictation
.
 
<EOS>
the
shallowness
of
a
waternixie
's
soul
may
have
a
charm
until
she
become
didactic
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
control
himself
,
and
only
say
,
with
a
touch
of
despotic
firmness

what
I
be
to
do
in
my
practice
,
Rosy
,
it
be
for
me
to
judge
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
the
question
between
us

<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
you
to
know
that
our
income
be
likely
to
be
a
very
narrow
one
 
hardly
four
hundred
,
<EOS>
perhaps
less
,
for
a
long
time
to
come
,
and
we
must
try
to
re
-
arrange
our
life
in
accordance
with
that
fact
.

<EOS>
Rosamond
be
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
,
look
before
her
,
and
then
say
,
"
My
uncle
Bulstrode
ought
to
allow
you
a
salary

from

point
out

check
himself

go
on
more
quietly

I
think
I
see
one
resource

would
free
us
from
a
good
deal
of
the
present
difficulty

I
hear
that

go
to
be
married
to
Miss
Sophy
Toller

They
be
rich
,
and
it
be
not
often
that
a
good
house
be
vacant
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
they
would
be
glad
to
take
this
house
from
us
with
most
of
our
furniture
,
and
they
would
be
willing
to
pay
handsomely
for
the
lease
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
employ
Trumbull
to
speak
to
Plymdale
about
it
.

"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
leave
her
husband
's
knee
and
walk
slowly
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
;
when
she
turn
round
and
walk
towards
him
it
be
evident
that
the
tear
have
come
,
and
that
she
be
bite
her
under

lip

clasp
her
hand
to
keep
herself
from
cry

<EOS>
Lydgate
be
wretched
 
shake
with
anger
and
yet
feel
that
it
would
be
unmanly
to
vent
the
anger
just
now

"
I
be
very
sorry

Rosamond
;
I
know
this
be
painful

I
think
,
at

,
when
I
have
bear
to
send
the
plate
back

have
that
man
take
an
inventory
of
the
furniture

would
suffice

explain
it
to
you
at
the
time

that
be
only
a
security

behind
that
Security
there
be
a
debt

that
debt
must
be
pay
within
the
next
few
month

we
shall
have
our

sell

young
Plymdale
will
take
our
house

most
of

we
shall
be
able

we
shall
be
quit

Lydgate
utter
this
speech

curt
hammering
way

we
usually
try

nail
down
a
vague
mind

imperative
fact

tear
roll
silently
down
Rosamond

cheek

she
just
press
her
handkerchief
against
them

stand
look
at
the
large
vase
on
the
mantel

piece

It
be
a
moment

more
intense
bitterness

without

careful
emphasis

out

use
of
my
leave
my
work
in
Middlemarch
to
go
where
I
have
none
?
 
<EOS>
We
should
be
just
as
penniless
elsewhere
as
we
be
here
,
"
say
Lydgate
still
more
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
be
to
be
in
that
position
it
will
be
entirely
your
own
doing
,
Tertius
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
turn
round
to
speak
with
the
full
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
behave
as
you
ought
to
do
to
your
own
family
.
 
<EOS>
You
offend
Captain
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Godwin
be
very
kind
to
me
when
we
be
at
Quallingham
,
and
I
be
sure
if
you
show
proper
regard
to
him
and
tell
him
your
affair
,
he
would
do
anything
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
rather
than
that
,
you
like
give
up
our
house
and
furniture
to
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
like
fierceness
in
Lydgate
's
eye
,
as
he
answer
with
new
violence
,
"
well
,
then
,
if
you
will
have
it
so
<EOS>
,
I
do
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
I
like
it
better
than
make
a
fool
of
myself
by
go
to
beg
where
it
be
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
understand
<EOS>
then
,
that
it
be
what
I
_
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
tone
in
the
last
sentence
which
be
equivalent
to
the
clutch
of
his
strong
hand
on
Rosamond
's
delicate
arm
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
all
that
,
his
will
be
not
a
whit
strong
than
hers
.
 
<EOS>
She
immediately
walk
out
of
the
room
in
silence
,
but
with
an
intense
determination
to
hinder
what
Lydgate
like
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
out
of
the
house
,
but
as
his
blood
cool
he
feel
that
the
chief
result
of
the
discussion
be
a
deposit
of
dread
within
him
at
the
idea
of
opening
with
his
wife
in
future
subject
which
may
again
urge
him
to
violent
speech
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
a
fracture
in
delicate
crystal
have
begin
,
and
he
be
afraid
of
any
movement
that
may
make
it
fatal
.
 
<EOS>
His
marriage
would
be
a
mere
piece
of
bitter
irony
if
they
could
not
go
on
love
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
long
ago
make
up
his
mind
to
what
he
think
be
her
negative
character
 
her
want
of
sensibility
,
which
show
itself
in
disregard
both
of
his
specific
wish
and
of
his
general
aim
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
great
disappointment
have
be
bear
:
the
tender
devotedness
and
docile
adoration
of
the
ideal
wife
must
be
renounce
,
and
life
must
be
take
up
on
a
low
stage
of
expectation
,
as
it
be
by
man
who
have
lose
their
limb
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
real
wife
have
not
only
her
claim
,
she
have
still
a
hold
on
his
heart
,
and
it
be
his
intense
desire
that
the
hold
should
remain
strong
.
 
<EOS>
in
marriage
,
the
certainty
,
"
She
will
never
love
me
much
,
"
be
easy
to
bear
than
the
fear
,
"
I
shall
love
her
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
hence
,
after
that
outburst
,
his
inward
effort
be
entirely
to
excuse
her
,
and
to
blame
the
hard
circumstance
which
be
partly
his
fault
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
that
evening
,
by
pet
her
,
to
heal
the
wound
he
have
make
in
the
morning
,
and
it
be
not
in
Rosamond
's
nature
to
be
repellent
or
sulky
;
indeed
,
she
welcome
the
sign
that
her
husband
love
her
and
be
under
control
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
something
quite
distinct
from
love
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
lydgate
would
not
have
choose
soon
to
recur
to
the
plan
of
part
with
the
house
;
he
be
resolve
to
carry
it
out
,
and
say
as
little
more
about
it
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
herself
touch
on
it
at
breakfast
by
say
,
mildly
    
"
have
you
speak
to
Trumbull
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
call
on
him
as
I
go
by
this
morning
.
<EOS>
no
time
must
be
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
take
Rosamond
's
question
as
a
sign
that
she
withdraw
her
inward
opposition
,
and
kiss
her
head
caressingly
when
he
get
up
to
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
it
be
late
enough
to
make
a
call
,
Rosamond
go
to
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
Mr.
Ned
's
mother
,
and
enter
with
pretty
congratulation
into
the
subject
of
the
coming
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Plymdale
's
maternal
view
be
,
that
Rosamond
may
possibly
now
have
retrospective
glimpse
of
her
own
folly
;
and
feel
the
advantage
to
be
at
present
all
on
the
side
of
her
son
,
be
too
kind
a
woman
not
to
behave
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Ned
be
most
happy
,
I
must
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
Sophy
Toller
be
all
I
could
desire
in
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
of
course
her
father
be
able
to
do
something
handsome
for
her
 
<EOS>
that
be
only
what
would
be
expect
with
a
brewery
like
his
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
connection
be
everything
we
should
desire
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
what
I
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
such
a
very
nice
girl
 
<EOS>
no
air
,
no
pretension
,
though
on
a
level
with
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
with
the
title
aristocracy
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
very
little
good
in
people
aim
out
of
their
own
sphere
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
that
Sophy
be
equal
to
the
good
in
the
town
,
and
she
be
content
with
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
think
her
very
agreeable
,
"
say
Rosamond
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
look
upon
it
as
a
reward
for
Ned
,
who
never
hold
his
head
too
high
,
that
he
should
have
get
into
the
very
good
connection
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
her
native
sharpness
soften
by
a
fervid
sense
that
she
be
take
a
correct
view
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
such
particular
people
as
the
toller
be
,
they
may
have
object
because
some
of
our
friend
be
not
theirs
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
that
your
aunt
Bulstrode
and
I
have
be
intimate
from
our
youth
,
and
Mr.
Plymdale
have
be
always
on
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
side
.
<EOS>
and
I
myself
prefer
serious
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
toller
have
welcome
Ned
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
be
a
very
deserving
,
well
-
principle
young
man
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
a
neat
air
of
patronage
in
return
for
Mrs.
Plymdale
's
wholesome
correction
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
have
not
the
style
of
a
captain
in
the
army
,
or
that
sort
of
carriage
as
if
everybody
be
beneath
him
,
or
that
showy
kind
of
talking
,
and
singe
,
and
intellectual
talent
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
thankful
he
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
poor
preparation
both
for
here
and
Hereafter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
yes
;
appearance
have
very
little
to
do
with
happiness
,
"
say
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
be
every
prospect
of
their
be
a
happy
couple
.
 
<EOS>
what
house
will
they
take
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
as
for
that
,
they
must
put
up
with
what
they
can
get
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
look
at
the
house
in
St.
Peter
's
Place
,
next
to
Mr.
Hackbutt
's
;
it
belong
to
him
,
and
he
be
put
it
nicely
in
repair
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
be
not
likely
to
hear
of
a
well
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
Ned
will
decide
the
matter
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
be
a
nice
house
;
I
like
St.
Peter
's
Place
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
near
the
Church
,
and
a
genteel
situation
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
window
be
narrow
,
and
it
be
all
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
happen
to
know
of
any
other
that
would
be
at
liberty
?
"
say
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
fix
her
round
black
eye
on
Rosamond
with
the
animation
of
a
sudden
thought
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
no
<EOS>
;
I
hear
so
little
of
those
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
not
foresee
that
question
and
answer
in
set
out
to
pay
her
visit
;
she
have
simply
mean
to
gather
any
information
which
would
help
her
to
avert
the
parting
with
her
own
house
under
circumstance
thoroughly
disagreeable
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
untruth
in
her
reply
,
she
no
more
reflected
on
it
than
she
do
on
the
untruth
there
be
in
her
say
that
appearance
have
very
little
to
do
with
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
object
,
she
be
convince
,
be
thoroughly
justifiable
:
it
be
Lydgate
whose
intention
be
inexcusable
;
and
there
be
a
plan
in
her
mind
which
,
when
she
have
carry
it
out
fully
,
would
prove
how
very
false
a
step
it
would
have
be
for
him
to
have
descend
from
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
She
return
home
by
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
's
office
,
mean
to
call
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
Rosamond
have
think
of
do
anything
in
the
form
of
business
,
but
she
feel
equal
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
should
be
oblige
to
do
what
she
intensely
dislike
,
be
an
idea
which
turn
her
quiet
tenacity
into
active
invention
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
case
in
which
it
could
not
be
enough
simply
to
disobey
and
be
serenely
,
placidly
obstinate
:
she
must
act
accord
to
her
judgment
,
and
she
say
to
herself
that
her
judgment
be
right
 
"
indeed
,
if
it
have
not
be
,
she
would
not
have
wish
to
act
on
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Trumbull
be
in
the
back
-
room
of
his
office
,
and
receive
Rosamond
with
his
fine
manner
,
not
only
because
he
have
much
sensibility
to
her
charm
,
but
because
the
good
-
natured
fibre
in
him
be
stir
by
his
certainty
that
Lydgate
be
in
difficulty
,
and
that
this
uncommonly
pretty
woman
 
this
young
lady
with
the
high
personal
attraction
 
be
likely
to
feel
the
pinch
of
trouble
 
to
find
herself
involve
in
circumstance
beyond
her
control

<EOS>
He
beg
her
to
do
him
the
honor
to
take
a
seat
,
and
stand
before
her
trim
and
comport
himself
with
an
eager
solicitude
,
which
be
chiefly
benevolent
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
's
first
question
be
,
whether
her
husband
have
call
on
Mr.
Trumbull
that
morning
,
to
speak
about
dispose
of
their
house

yes

madam

yes
,
he
do
;
he
do
so
,
"
say
the
good
auctioneer
,
try
to
throw
something
soothing
into
his
iteration
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
about
to
fulfil
his
order

if
possible

this
afternoon

He
wish
me
not

procrastinate

I
call
to
tell
you
not

any
further

I
beg
of
you
not

mention
what

you
oblige
me

certainly
I
will

Mrs.

confidence
be
sacred

me
on
business

any
other
topic

I
be
then
to
consider
the
commission

say
Mr.
Trumbull
,
adjust
the
long
end
of
his
blue
cravat
with
both
hand
,
and
look
at
Rosamond
deferentially

"
yes
,
if
you
please

I
find
that
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
have
take
a
house
 
<EOS>
the
one
in
St.
Peter
's
Place
next
to
Mr.
Hackbutt
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lydgate
would
be
annoy
that
his
order
should
be
fulfil
uselessly

and
besides
that
,
there
be
other
circumstance
which
render
the
proposal
unnecessary

<EOS>
"
very
good
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
very
good

I
be
at
your
command
,
whenever
you
require
any
service
of
me

say
Mr.
Trumbull
,
who
feel
pleasure
in
conjecture
that
some
new
resource
have
be
open
.
 
<EOS>
"
rely
on
me
,
I
beg

<EOS>
the
affair
shall
go
no
further

"
  
<EOS>
that
evening
Lydgate
be
a
little
comfort
by
observe
that
Rosamond
be
more
lively
than
she
have
usually
be
of
late
,
and
even
seem
interested
in
do
what
would
please
him
without
be
ask

He
think
,
"
if
she
will
be
happy
and
I
can
rub
through
,
what
do
it
all
signify
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
narrow
swamp
that
we
have
to
pass
in
a
long
journey
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
can
get
my
mind
clear
again
,
I
shall
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
cheered
that
he
begin
to
search
for
an
account
of
experiment
which
he
have
long
ago
mean
to
look
up
,
and
have
neglect
out
of
that
creep
self
-
despair
which
come
in
the
train
of
petty
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
again
some
of
the
old
delightful
absorption
in
a
far
-
reach
inquiry
,
while
Rosamond
play
the
quiet
music
which
be
as
helpful
to
his
meditation
as
the
plash
of
an
oar
on
the
evening
lake
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
late
;
he
have
push
away
all
the

be
look
at
the
fire
with
his
hand
clasp
behind
his
head
in
forgetfulness
of

the
construction
of
a
new
controlling
experiment

when
Rosamond
,
who
have
leave
the
piano
and
be
lean
back
in

chair
watch
him

look
up
in

moment

like
a
man

flush
with
an
unpleasant
consciousness

He
be
feel
bitter
disappointment
,
as
if
he
have
open
a
door
out
of
a
suffocate
place
and
have
find
it
wall
up
;
but
he
also
feel
sure
that
Rosamond
be
pleased
with
the
cause
of
his
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
He
prefer
not
look
at
her
and
not
speak
,
until
he
have
get
over
the
first
spasm
of
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
say
in
his
bitterness
,
what
can
a
woman
care
about
so
much
as
house
and
furniture
?
<EOS>
a
husband
without
them
be
an
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
look
up
and
push
his
hair
aside
,
his
dark
eye
have
a
miserable
blank
non
-
expectance
of
sympathy
in
them
,
but
he
only
say
,
coolly
    
"
perhaps
some
one
else
may
turn
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
Trumbull
to
be
on
the
look
-
out
if
he
fail
with
Plymdale
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
make
no
remark
.
 
<EOS>
She
trust
to
the
chance
that
nothing
more
would
pass
between
her
husband
and
the
auctioneer
until
some
issue
should
have
justify
her
interference
;
at
any
rate
,
she
have
hinder
the
event
which
she
immediately
dread
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
pause
,
she
say
    
"
how
much
money
be
it
that
those
disagreeable
people
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
disagreeable
people
?
"
  
"
those
who
take
the
list
 
and
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
how
much
money
would
satisfy
them
so
that
you
need
not
be
trouble
any
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
survey
her
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
be
look
for
symptom
,
and
then
say
,
"
oh
,
if
I
could
have
get
six
hundred
from
Plymdale
for
furniture
and
as
premium
,
I
may
have
manage
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
pay
off
Dover
,
and
give
enough
on
account
to
the
other
to
make
them
wait
patiently
,
if
we
contract
our
expense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
mean
how
much
should
you
want
if
we
stay
in
this
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
More
than
I
be
likely
to
get
anywhere
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
rather
a
grating
sarcasm
in
his
tone
.
 
<EOS>
It
anger
him
to
perceive
that
Rosamond
's
mind
be
wander
over
impracticable
wish
instead
of
face
possible
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
not
mention
the
sum
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
a
mild
indication
that
she
do
not
like
his
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Lydgate
in
a
guess
tone
,
"
it
would
take
at
least
a
thousand
to
set
me
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
"
he
add
,
incisively
,
"
I
have
to
consider
what
I
shall
do
without
it
,
not
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
next
day
she
carry
out
her
plan
of
write
to
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
since
the
Captain
's
visit
,
she
have
receive
a
letter
from
him
,
and
also
one
from
Mrs.
Mengan
,
his
marry
sister
,
condole
with
her
on
the
loss
of
her
baby
,
and
express
vaguely
the
hope
that
they
should
see
her
again
at
Quallingham
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
tell
her
that
this
politeness
mean
nothing
;
but
she
be
secretly
convince
that
any
backwardness
in
Lydgate
's
family
towards
him
be
due
to
his
cold
and
contemptuous
behavior
,
and
she
have
answer
the
letter
in
her
most
charming
manner
,
feel
some
confidence
that
a
specific
invitation
would
follow
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
total
silence
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
evidently
be
not
a
great
penman
,
and
Rosamond
reflect
that
the
sister
may
have
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
season
be
come
for
thinking
of
friend
at
home
,
and
at
any
rate
Sir
Godwin
,
who
have
chuck
her
under
the
chin
,
and
pronounce
her
to
be
like
the
celebrated
beauty
,
Mrs.
Croly
,
who
have
make
a
conquest
of
him
in
1790
,
would
be
touch
by
any
appeal
from
her
,
and
would
find
it
pleasant
for
her
sake
to
behave
as
he
ought
to
do
towards
his
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
naively
convince
of
what
an
old
gentleman
ought
to
do
to
prevent
her
from
suffer
annoyance
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
write
what
she
consider
the
most
judicious
letter
possible
 
one
which
would
strike
Sir
Godwin
as
a
proof
of
her
excellent
sense
 
point
out
how
desirable
it
be
that
Tertius
should
quit
such
a
place
as
Middlemarch
for
one
more
fit
to
his
talent
,
how
the
unpleasant
character
of
the
inhabitant
have
hinder
his
professional
success
,
and
how
in
consequence
he
be
in
money
difficulty
,
from
which
it
would
require
a
thousand
pound
thoroughly
to
extricate
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
say
that
Tertius
be
unaware
of
her
intention
to
write
;
for
she
have
the
idea
that
his
suppose
sanction
of
her
letter
would
be
in
accordance
with
what
she
do
say
of
his
great
regard
for
his
uncle
Godwin
as
the
relative
who
have
always
be
his
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
force
of
Poor
Rosamond
's
tactic
<EOS>
now
she
apply
them
to
affair
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
happen
before
the
party
on
New
Year
's
day
,
and
no
answer
have
yet
come
from
Sir
Godwin
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
the
morning
of
that
day
Lydgate
have
to
learn
that
Rosamond
have
revoke
his
order
to
Borthrop
Trumbull
.
<EOS>
feel
it
necessary
that
she
should
be
gradually
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
their
quit
the
house
in
Lowick
Gate
,
he
overcome
his
reluctance
to
speak
to
her
again
on
the
subject
,
and
when
they
be
breakfast
say
    
"
I
shall
try
to
see
Trumbull
this
morning
,
and
tell
him
to
advertise
the
house
in
the
"
Pioneer
"
and
the
"
Trumpet
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
thing
be
advertise
,
some
one
may
be
incline
to
take
it
who
would
not
otherwise
have
think
of
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
country
place
many
people
go
on
in
their
old
house
when
their
family
be
too
large
for
them
,
for
want
of
know
where
they
can
find
another
.
 
<EOS>
and
Trumbull
seem
to
have
get
no
bite
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
know
that
the
inevitable
moment
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
order
Trumbull
not
to
inquire
further
,
"
she
say
,
with
a
careful
calmness
which
be
evidently
defensive
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
stare
at
her
in
mute
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
only
half
an
hour
before
he
have
be
fasten
up
her
plait
for
her
,
and
talk
the
"
little
language
"
of
affection
,
which
Rosamond
,
though
not
return
it
,
accept
as
if
she
have
be
a
serene
and
lovely
image
,
now
and
then
miraculously
dimple
towards
her
votary
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
fibre
still
astir
in
him
,
the
shock
he
receive
could
not
at
once
be
distinctly
anger
;
it
be
confuse
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
down
the
knife
and
fork
with
which
he
be
carve
,
and
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
say
at
last
,
with
a
cool
irony
in
his
tone
    
"
May
I
ask
when
and
why
you
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
know
that
the
Plymdales
have
take
a
house
,
I
call
to
tell
him
not
to
mention
our
to
them
;
and
at
the
same
time
I
tell
him
not
to
let
the
affair
go
on
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
would
be
very
injurious
to
you
if
it
be
know
that
you
wish
to
part
with
your
house
and
furniture
,
and
I
have
a
very
strong
objection
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
be
reason
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
no
consequence
then
that
I
have
tell
you
imperative
reason
of
another
kind
;
of
no
consequence
that
I
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion
,
and
give
an
order
accordingly
?
<EOS>
"
say
Lydgate
,
bitingly
,
the
thunder
and
lightning
gather
about
his
brow
and
eye
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
any
one
's
anger
on
Rosamond
have
always
be
to
make
her
shrink
in
cold
dislike
,
and
to
become
all
the
more
calmly
correct
,
in
the
conviction
that
she
be
not
the
person
to
misbehave
whatever
other
may
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
reply
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
a
perfect
right
to
speak
on
a
subject
which
concern
me
at
least
as
much
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
clearly
 
you
have
a
right
to
speak
,
but
only
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
contradict
my
order
secretly
,
and
treat
me
as
if
I
be
a
fool
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
in
the
same
tone
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
then
with
some
add
scorn
,
"
be
it
possible
to
make
you
understand
what
the
consequence
will
be
?
<EOS>
be
it
of
any
use
for
me
to
tell
you
again
why
we
must
try
to
part
with
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
necessary
for
you
to
tell
me
again
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
in
a
voice
that
fall
and
trickle
like
cold
water
-
drop
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
what
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
just
as
violently
as
you
do
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
do
not
alter
my
opinion
that
you
ought
to
try
every
other
mean
rather
than
take
a
step
which
be
so
painful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
advertise
the
house
,
I
think
it
would
be
perfectly
degrade
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
suppose
I
disregard
your
opinion
as
you
disregard
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
so
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
ought
to
have
tell
me
before
we
be
married
that
you
would
place
me
in
the
bad
position
,
rather
than
give
up
your
own
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
speak
,
but
toss
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
twitch
the
corner
of
his
mouth
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
see
that
he
be
not
look
at
her
,
rise
and
set
his
cup
of
coffee
before
him
;
but
he
take
no
notice
of
it
,
and
go
on
with
an
inward
drama
and
argument
,
occasionally
move
in
his
seat
,
rest
one
arm
on
the
table
,
and
rub
his
hand
against
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
conflux
of
emotion
and
thought
in
him
that
would
not
let
him
either
give
thorough
way
to
his
anger
or
persevere
with
simple
rigidity
of
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
take
advantage
of
his
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
we
be
marry
everyone
feel
that
your
position
be
very
high
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
imagine
then
that
you
would
want
to
sell
our
furniture
,
and
take
a
house
in
Bride
Street
,
where
the
room
be
like
cage
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
live
in
that
way
let
us
at
least
leave
Middlemarch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
would
be
very
strong
consideration
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
<EOS>
half
ironically
 
still
there
be
a
withered
paleness
about
his
lip
as
he
look
at
his
coffee
,
and
do
not
drink
 
<EOS>
"
these
would
be
very
strong
consideration
if
I
do
not
happen
to
be
in
debt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
many
person
must
have
be
in
debt
in
the
same
way
,
but
if
they
be
respectable
,
people
trust
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
hear
<EOS>
papa
say
that
the
Torbits
be
in
debt
,
and
they
go
on
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
good
to
act
rashly
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
with
serene
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
sit
paralyze
by
oppose
impulse
:
since
no
reasoning
he
could
apply
to
Rosamond
seem
likely
to
conquer
her
assent
,
he
want
to
smash
and
grind
some
object
on
which
he
could
at
least
produce
an
impression
,
or
else
to
tell
her
brutally
that
he
be
master
,
and
she
must
obey
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
not
only
dread
the
effect
of
such
extremity
on
their
mutual
life
 
<EOS>
he
have
a
grow
dread
of
Rosamond
's
quiet
elusive
obstinacy
,
which
would
not
allow
any
assertion
of
power
to
be
final
;
and
again
,
she
have
touch
him
in
a
spot
of
keen
feel
by
imply
that
she
have
be
delude
with
a
false
vision
of
happiness
in
marry
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
say
that
he
be
master
,
it
be
not
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
resolution
to
which
he
have
work
himself
by
dint
of
logic
and
honorable
pride
be
begin
to
relax
under
her
torpedo
contact
.
 
<EOS>
He
swallow
half
his
cup
of
coffee
,
and
then
rise
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
at
least
request
that
you
will
not
go
to
Trumbull
at
present
 
until
it
have
be
see
that
there
be
no
other
mean
,
"
say
Rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
although
she
be
not
subject
to
much
fear
,
she
feel
it
safe
not
to
betray
that
she
have
write
to
Sir
Godwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
to
him
for
a
few
week
,
or
without
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
give
a
short
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
I
who
should
exact
a
promise
that
you
will
do
nothing
without
tell
me
,
"
he
say
,
turn
his
eye
sharply
upon
her
,
and
then
move
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
that
we
be
go
to
dine
at
papa
's
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
wish
that
he
should
turn
and
make
a
more
thorough
concession
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
he
only
say
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
"
impatiently
,
and
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
hold
it
to
be
very
odious
in
him
that
he
do
not
think
the
painful
proposition
he
have
have
to
make
to
her
be
enough
,
without
show
so
unpleasant
a
temper
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
put
the
moderate
request
that
he
would
defer
go
to
Trumbull
again
,
it
be
cruel
in
him
not
to
assure
her
of
what
he
mean
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
convince
of
her
have
act
in
every
way
for
the
good
;
and
each
grating
or
angry
speech
of
Lydgate
's
serve
only
as
an
addition
to
the
register
of
offence
in
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Rosamond
for
month
have
begin
to
associate
her
husband
with
feeling
of
disappointment
,
and
the
terribly
inflexible
relation
of
marriage
have
lose
its
charm
of
encourage
delightful
dream
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
free
her
from
the
disagreeable
of
her
father
's
house
,
but
it
have
not
give
her
everything
that
she
have
wish
and
hope
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lydgate
with
whom
she
have
be
in
love
have
be
a
group
of
airy
condition
for
her
,
most
of
which
have
disappear
,
while
their
place
have
be
take
by
every

day
detail
which
must
be
live
through
slowly
from
hour
to
hour
,
not
float
through
with
a
rapid
selection
of
favorable
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
the
habit
of
Lydgate
's
profession
,
his
home
preoccupation
with
scientific
subject
,
which
seem
to
her
almost
like
a
morbid
vampire
's
taste
,
his
peculiar
view
of
thing
which
have
never
enter
into
the
dialogue
of
courtship
 
<EOS>
all
these
continually
alienate
influence
,
even
without
the
fact
of
his
have
place
himself
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
town
,
and
without
that
first
shock
of
revelation
about
Dover
's
debt
,
would
have
make
his
presence
dull
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
presence
which
ever
since
the
early
day
of
her
marriage
,
until
four
month
ago
,
have
be
an
agreeable
excitement
,
but
that
be
go
:
Rosamond
would
not
confess
to
herself
how
much
the
consequent
blank
have
to
do
with
her
utter
ennui
;
and
it
seem
to
her
(
perhaps
she
be
right
)
that
an
invitation
to
Quallingham
,
and
an
opening
for
Lydgate
to
settle
elsewhere
than
in
Middlemarch
 
in
London
,
or
somewhere
likely
to
be
free
from
unpleasantness
 
would
satisfy
her
quite
well
,
and
make
her
indifferent
to
the
absence
of
Will
Ladislaw
,
towards
whom
she
feel
some
resentment
for
his
exaltation
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
state
of
thing
with
Lydgate
and
Rosamond
on
the
New
Year
's
day
when
they
dine
at
her
father
's
,
she
look
mildly
neutral
towards
him
in
remembrance
of
his
ill
-
temper
behavior
at
breakfast
,
and
he
carry
a
much
deep
effect
from
the
inward
conflict
in
which
that
morning
scene
be
only
one
of
many
epochs
.
 
<EOS>
His
flushed
effort
while
talk
to
Mr.
Farebrother
 
his
effort
after
the
cynical
pretence
that
all
way
of
get
money
be
essentially
the
same
,
and
that
chance
have
an
empire
which
reduce
choice
to
a
fool
's
illusion
 
be
<EOS>
but
the
symptom
of
a
wavering
resolve
,
a
benumbed
response
to
the
old
stimulus
of
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
see
even
more
keenly
than
Rosamond
do
the
dreariness
of
take
her
into
the
small
house
in
Bride
Street
,
where
she
would
have
scanty
furniture
around
her
and
discontent
within
:
a
life
of
privation
and
life
with
Rosamond
be
two
image
which
have
become
more
and
more
irreconcilable
ever
since
the
threat
of
privation
have
disclose
itself
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
if
his
resolve
have
force
the
two
image
into
combination
,
the
useful
preliminary
to
that
hard
change
be
not
visibly
within
reach
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
he
have
not
give
the
promise
which
his
wife
have
ask
for
,
he
do
not
go
again
to
Trumbull
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
begin
to
think
of
take
a
rapid
journey
to
the
North
and
see
Sir
Godwin
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
once
believe
that
nothing
would
urge
him
into
make
an
application
for
money
to
his
uncle
,
but
he
have
not
then
know
the
full
pressure
of
alternative
yet
more
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
depend
on
the
effect
of
a
letter
;
it
be
only
in
an
interview
,
however
disagreeable
this
may
be
to
himself
,
that
he
could
give
a
thorough
explanation
and
could
test
the
effectiveness
of
kinship
.
 
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Lydgate
begin
to
represent
this
step
to
himself
as
the
easy
than
there
be
a
reaction
of
anger
that
he
 
<EOS>
he
who
have
long
ago
determine
to
live
aloof
from
such
abject
calculation
,
such
self
-
interested
anxiety
about
the
inclination
and
the
pocket
of
man
with
whom
he
have
be
proud
to
have
no
aim
in
common
 
should
have
fall
not
simply
to
their
level

to
the
level
of

in

<EOS>
what
wonder
then
that
in
1832
old
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
be
slow
to
write
a
letter
which
be
of
consequence
to
other

nearly
three
week
of

new

and
Rosamond
,
await
an
answer
to
her
win
appeal
,
be
every

<EOS>
Lydgate
,
in
total
ignorance
of
her
expectation
,
be
see
the
bill
come
in
,
and
feel
that
Dover
's
use
of
his
advantage
over
other
creditor
be
imminent
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
mention
to
Rosamond
his
brood
purpose
of
go
to
Quallingham
:
he
do
not
want
to
admit
what
would
appear
to
her
a
concession
to
her
wish
after
indignant
refusal
,
until
the
last
moment
;
but
he
be
really
expect
to
set
off
soon
.
 
<EOS>
a
slice
of
the
railway
would
enable
him
to
manage
the
whole
journey
and
back
in
four
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
morning
after
Lydgate
have
go
out
,
a
letter
come
address
to
him
,
which
Rosamond
see
clearly
to
be
from
Sir
Godwin
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
there
may
be
a
particular
note
to
her
enclose
;
but
Lydgate
be
naturally
address
on
the
question
of
money
or
other
aid
,
and
the
fact
that
he
be
write
to
,
nay
,
the
very
delay
in
write
at
all
,
seem
to
certify
that
the
answer
be
thoroughly
compliant
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
too
much
excited
by
these
thought
to
do
anything
but
<EOS>
light
stitching
in
a
warm
corner
of
the
dining
-
room
,
with
the
outside
of
this
momentous
letter
lie
on
the
table
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
about
twelve
<EOS>
she
hear
her
husband
's
step
in
the
passage
,
and
trip
to
open
the
door
,
she
say
in
her
light
tone
,
"
Tertius
,
come
in
here
 
here
be
a
letter
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
not
take
off
his
hat
,
but
just
turn
her
round
within
his
arm
to
walk
towards
the
spot
where
the
letter
lie
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
Godwin
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
while
Rosamond
reseat
herself
,
and
watch
him
as
he
open
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
expect
him
to
be
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
while
Lydgate
's
eye
glance
rapidly
over
the
brief
letter
,
she
see
his
face
,
usually
of
a
pale
brown
,
take
on
a
dry
whiteness
;
with
nostril
and
lip
quiver
he
toss
down
the
letter
before
her
,
and
say
violently
    
"
It
will
be
impossible
to
endure
life
with
you

if
you
will
always
be
act
secretly
 
act

me
and
hide
your

"
  
<EOS>
He
check
his
speech
and
turn
his
back
on
her
 
then
wheel
round
and
walk
about
,
sit
down
,
and
get
up
again
restlessly
,
grasp
hard
the
object
deep
down
in
his
pocket

<EOS>
He
be
afraid
of
say
something
irremediably
cruel

<EOS>
Rosamond
too
have
change
color
as
she
read

<EOS>
the
letter
run
in

way
:
    
"
DEAR
TERTIUS
,
 
do
not
set
your
wife
to
write
to
me
when
you
have
anything
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
roundabout
wheedling
sort
of
thing
which
I
should
not
have
credit
you
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
choose
to
write
to
a
woman
on
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
my
supply
you
with
a
thousand
pound
,
or
only
half
that
sum
,
I
can
do
nothing
of
the
sort
.

My
own
family
drain
me
to
the
last
penny

<EOS>
with
two
young
son
and
three
daughter
,
I
be
not
likely
to
have
cash
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
have
get
through
your
own
money
pretty
quickly
,
and
to
have
make
a
mess
where
you
be
;
the
sooner
you
go
somewhere
else
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
man
of
your
profession
,
and
can
not
help
you
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
the
good
I
could
for
you
as
guardian
,
and
let
you
have
your
own
way
in
take
to
medicine

<EOS>
You
may
have
go
into
the
army
or
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
Your
money
would
have
hold
out
for
that
,
and
there
would
have
be
a
sure
ladder
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
uncle
Charles
have
have
a
grudge
against
you
for
not
go
into
his
profession
,
but
not
I.
<EOS>
I
have
always
wish
you
well
,
but
you

on
your
own
leg
entirely

"
  
<EOS>
when
Rosamond
have
finish
read
the
letter
she
sit
quite
still
,
with
her
hand
fold
before
her
,
restrain
any
show
of
her
keen
disappointment
,
and
intrench
herself
in
quiet
passivity
under
her
husband
's
wrath

<EOS>
Lydgate
pause
in
his
movement
,
look
at
her
again
,
and
say
,
with
bite
severity
    
"
Will
this
be
enough
to
convince
you
of
the
harm
you
may
do

secret
meddling

you
sense
enough
to
recognize
now
your
incompetence

the
word
be
hard
;
but
this
be
not
the
first
time
that
Lydgate
have
be
frustrate
by
her

<EOS>
She
do
not
look
at
him

make
no
reply

<EOS>
"
I
have
nearly
resolve
on
go
to
Quallingham

<EOS>
It
would
have
cost
me
pain
enough
to
do
it
,
yet
it
may
have
be
of
some
use

it
have
be

delude
me
with

<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
moment
in
young
life
when
the
closeness
of
love
's
bond
have
turn
to
this
power

gall

<EOS>
in

of
Rosamond

control
a

fall
silently

roll
over

<EOS>
She
still

nothing

under
that

hide
an
intense
effect

such
entire
disgust

disagreeable

how
annoying
they
be

<EOS>
even
her

be
unkind

may
have

more

in

there
be

one
person
in
Rosamond

she
do
not

as
blameworthy

that
be
the
graceful

with

with

pause

maddening
sense

helplessness
which
come
over
passionate

when
their

be
meet
by
an
innocent

look
silence
whose
meek
victimize
air
seem
to
put

in

and
at

infect
even
the
just
indignation
with
a
doubt

He
need
to
recover
the

begin

grave

that
nothing

so
fatal

It
have
happen
again

again

express

seem

assent

yet
after

disobey

in

way
I
can
never

would
be
some

such

unreasonable

furious

should
you
not

still
silence

"
Will
you
only
say
that
you

be
mistake

future

"
<EOS>
say
Lydgate
,
urgently
,
<EOS>
but
with
something
of
request
in
his
tone
which
Rosamond
be
quick
to
perceive

<EOS>
She
speak
with
coolness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

I

I

never

You
speak

certainly
you

<EOS>
another
tear
fall
as
Rosamond
cease
speak

she
press
it
away
as
quietly
as
the
first

Lydgate
fling
himself
into

feel
checkmate

what
place
be
there
in

He
lay
down
his
hat
,
fling
an
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
,
and
look
down
for
some
moment
without
speak

<EOS>
Rosamond
have
the
double
purchase
over
him
of
insensibility
to
the
point
of
justice
in
his
reproach

and
of
sensibility
to
the
undeniable
hardship
now
present
in

although
her
duplicity
in
the
affair

have
exceed
what

really
hinder

action

We

not

identify
our

to
a
strict
classification
,
any
more

the
material

<EOS>
Rosamond
feel
that
she
be
aggrieve
,
and
that
this
be
what
Lydgate
have
to
recognize
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
him
,
the
need
of
accommodate
himself
to
her
nature
,
which
be
inflexible
in
proportion
to
its
negation
,
hold
him
as
with
pincer
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
have
an
alarmed
foresight
of
her
irrevocable
loss
of
love
for
him
,
and
the
consequent
dreariness
of
their
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
ready
fulness
of
his
emotion
make
this
dread
alternate
quickly
with
the
first
violent
movement
of
his
anger
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
assuredly
have
be
a
vain
boast
in
him
to
say
that
he
be
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
make
my
life
pleasant
to
me
of
late
"
 
"
the
hardship
which
our
marriage
have
bring
on
me
"
 
these
word
be
sting
his
imagination
as
a
pain
make
an
exaggerated
dream
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
not
only
to
sink
from
his
high
resolve
,
but
to
sink
into
the
hideous
fettering
of
domestic
hate
?
  
<EOS>
"
rosamond
,
"
he
say
,
turn
his
eye
on
her
with
a
melancholy
look
,
"
you
should
allow
for
a
man
's
word
when
he
be
disappointed
and
provoke
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
can
not
have
opposite
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
part
my
happiness
from
yours
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
angry
with
you
,
it
be
that
you
seem
not
to
see
how
any
concealment
divide
us
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
wish
to
make
anything
hard
to
you
either
by
my
word
or
conduct
?
 
<EOS>
when
I
hurt
you
,
I
hurt
part
of
my
own
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
be
angry
with
you
if
you
would
be
quite
open
with
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
wish
to
prevent
you
from
hurry
us
into
wretchedness
without
any
necessity

"
say
Rosamond
,
the
tear
come
again
from
a
softened
feeling
now
that
her
husband
have
soften
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
very
hard
to
be
disgrace
here
among
all
the
people
we
know
,
and
to
live
in
such
a
miserable
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
die
with
the
baby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
and
weep
with
that
gentleness
which
make
such
word
and
tear
omnipotent
over
a
loving
-
hearted
man
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
draw
his
chair
near
to
hers
and
press
her
delicate
head
against
his
cheek
with
his
powerful
tender
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
caress
her
;
he
do
not
say
anything
;
for
what
be
there
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
promise
to
shield
her
from
the
dreaded
wretchedness
,
for
he
could
see
no
sure
mean
of
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
leave
her
to
go
out
again
,
he
tell
himself
that
it
be
ten
time
harder
for
her
than
for
him
:
he
have
a
life
away
from
home
,
and
constant
appeal
to
his
activity
on
behalf
of
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
wish
to
excuse
everything
in
her
if
he
could
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
inevitable
that
in
that
excuse
mood
he
should
think
of
her
as
if
she
be
an
animal
of
another
and
feebler
specie
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
she
have
master
him
.
        
<EOS>
"

Tis
one

another

"
                            
measure
for
measure

<EOS>
Lydgate
certainly
have
good
reason
to
reflect
on
the
service
his
practice
do
him
in
counteract
his
personal
care
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
longer
free
energy
enough
for
spontaneous
research
and
speculative
thinking
,
but
by
the
bedside
of
patient
,
the
direct
external
call
on
his
judgment
and
sympathy
bring
the
add
impulse
need
to
draw
him
out
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
simply
that
beneficent
harness
of
routine
which
enable
silly
man
to
live
respectably
and
unhappy
man
to
live
calmly
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
perpetual
claim
on
the
immediate
fresh
application
of
thought
,
and
on
the
consideration
of
another
's
need
and
trial
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
us
look
back
through
life
would
say
that
the
kind
man
we
have
ever
know
have
be
a
medical
man
,
or
perhaps
that
surgeon
whose
fine
tact
,
direct
by
deeply
informed
perception
,
have
come
to
us
in
our
need
with
a
more
sublime
beneficence
than
that
of
miracle
-
worker
.
<EOS>
some
of
that
twice
-
bless
mercy
be
always
with
Lydgate
in
his
work
at
the
Hospital
or
in
private
house
,
serve
better
than
any
opiate
to
quiet
and
sustain
him
under
his
anxiety
and
his
sense
of
mental
degeneracy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
's
suspicion
as
to
the
opiate
be
true
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
first
gall
pressure
of
foreseen
difficulty
,
and
the
first
perception
that
his
marriage
,
if
it
be
not
to
be
a
yoke
loneliness
,
must
be
a
state
of
effort
to
go
on
love
without
too
much
care
about
be
love
,
he
have
once
or
twice
try
a
dose
of
opium
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
hereditary
constitutional
craving
after
such
transient
escape
from
the
haunting
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
strong
,
could
drink
a
great
deal
of
wine
,
but
do
not
care
about
it
;
and
when
the
man
round
him
be
drink
spirit
,
he
take
sugar
and
water
,
have
a
contemptuous
pity
even
for
the
early
stage
of
excitement
from
drink
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
gambling
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
look
on
at
a
great
deal
of
gambling
in
Paris
,
watch
it
as
if
it
have
be
a
disease
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
more
tempt
by
such
winning
than
he
be
by
drink
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
say
to
himself
that
the
only
win
he
care
for
must
be
attain
by
a
conscious
process
of
high
,
difficult
combination
tend
towards
a
beneficent
result
.
 
<EOS>
the
power
he
long
for
could
not
be
represent
by
agitated
finger
clutch
a
heap
of
coin
,
or
by
the
half
-
barbarous
,
half
-
idiotic
triumph
in
the
eye
of
a
man
who
sweep
within
his
arm
the
venture
of
twenty
chapfallen
companion
.
  
<EOS>
but
just
as
he
have
try
opium
,
so
his
thought
now
begin
to
turn
upon
gambling
 
not
with
appetite
for
its
excitement
,
but
with
a
sort
of
wistful
inward
gaze
after
that
easy
way
of
get
money
,
which
imply
no
asking
and
bring
no
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
in
London
or
Paris
at
that
time
,
it
be
probable
that
such
thought
,
second
by
opportunity
,
would
have
take
him
into
a
gambling
-
house
,
no
longer
to
watch
the
gambler
,
but
to
watch
with
them
in
kindre
eagerness
.
<EOS>
repugnance
would
have
be
surmount
by
the
immense
need
to
win
,
if
chance
would
be
kind
enough
to
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
an
incident
which
happen
not
very
long
after
that
airy
notion
of
get
aid
from
his
uncle
have
be
exclude
,
be
a
strong
sign
of
the
effect
that
may
have
follow
any
extant
opportunity
of
gambling
.
  
<EOS>
the
billiard
-
room
at
the
Green
Dragon
be
the
constant
resort
of
a
certain
set
,
most
of
whom
,
like
our
acquaintance
Mr.
Bambridge
,
be
regard
as
man
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
poor
Fred
Vincy
have
make
part
of
his
memorable
debt
,
have
lose
money
in
betting
,
and
be
oblige
to
borrow
of
that
gay
companion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
generally
know
in
Middlemarch
that
a
good
deal
of
money
be
lose
and
win
in
this
way
;
and
the
consequent
repute
of
the
Green
Dragon
as
a
place
of
dissipation
naturally
heighten
in
some
quarter
the
temptation
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
probably
its
regular
visitant
,
like
the
initiate
of
freemasonry
,
wish
that
there
be
something
a
little
more
tremendous
to
keep
to
themselves
concern
it
;
but
they
be
not
a
close
community
,
and
many
decent
senior
as
well
as
junior
occasionally
turn
into
the
billiard
-
room
to
see
what
be
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
who
have
the
muscular
aptitude
for
billiard
,
and
be
fond
of
the
game
,
have
once
or
twice
in
the
early
day
after
his
arrival
in
Middlemarch
take
his
turn
with
the
cue
at
the
Green
Dragon
;
but
afterwards
he
have
no
leisure
for
the
game
,
and
no
inclination
for
the
sociality
there
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
,
however
,
he
have
occasion
to
seek
Mr.
Bambridge
at
that
resort
.
 
<EOS>
the
horsedealer
have
engage
to
get
him
a
customer
for
his
remain
good
horse
,
for
which
Lydgate
have
determine
to
substitute
a
cheap
hack
,
hope
by
this
reduction
of
style
to
get
perhaps
twenty
pound
;
and
he
care
now
for
every
small
sum
,
as
a
help
towards
feed
the
patience
of
his
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
to
run
up
to
the
billiard
-
room
,
as
he
be
pass
,
would
save
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bambridge
be
not
yet
come
,
but
would
be
sure
to
arrive
by
-
and
-
by
,
say
his
friend
Mr.
Horrock
;
and
Lydgate
stay
,
play
a
game
for
the
sake
of
pass
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
he
have
the
peculiar
light
in
the
eye
and
the
unusual
vivacity
which
have
be
once
notice
in
him
by
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
the
exceptional
fact
of
his
presence
be
much
notice
in
the
room
,
where
there
be
a
good
deal
of
Middlemarch
company
;
and
several
looker
-
on
,
as
well
as
some
of
the
player
,
be
bet
with
animation
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
play
well
,
and
feel
confident
;
the
bet
be
drop
round
him
,
and
with
a
swift
glance
thought
of
the
probable
gain
which
may
double
the
sum
he
be
save
from
his
horse
,
he
begin
to
bet
on
his
own
play
,
and
win
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bambridge
have
come
in
,
but
Lydgate
do
not
notice
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
excited
with
his
play
,
but
vision
be
gleam
on
him
of
go
the
next
day
to
Brassing
,
where
there
be
gambling
on
a
grander
scale
to
be
have
,
and
where
,
by
one
powerful
snatch
at
the
devil
's
bait
,
he
may
carry
it
off
without
the
hook
,
and
buy
his
rescue
from
his
daily
soliciting
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
win
when
two
new
visitor
enter
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
a
young
Hawley
,
just
come
from
his
law
study
in
town
,
and
the
other
be
Fred
Vincy
,
who
have
spend
several
evening
of
late
at
this
old
haunt
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Hawley
,
an
accomplished
billiard
-
player
,
bring
a
cool
fresh
hand
to
the
cue
.
 
<EOS>
but
Fred
Vincy
,
startle
at
see
Lydgate
,
and
astonish
to
see
him
bet
with
an
excited
air
,
stand
aside
,
and
keep
out
of
the
circle
round
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
have
be
reward
resolution
by
a
little
laxity
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
work
heartily
for
six
month
at
all
outdoor
occupation
under
Mr.
Garth
,
and
by
dint
of
severe
practice
have
nearly
master
the
defect
of
his
handwriting
,
this
practice
being
,
perhaps
,
a
little
the
less
severe
that
it
be
often
carry
on
in
the
evening
at
Mr.
Garth
's
under
the
eye
of
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
last
fortnight
Mary
have
be
stay
at
Lowick
Parsonage
with
the
lady
there
,
during
Mr.
Farebrother
's
residence
in
Middlemarch
,
where
he
be
carry
out
some
parochial
plan
;
and
Fred
,
not
see
anything
more
agreeable
to
do
,
have
turn
into
the
Green
Dragon
,
partly
to
play
at
billiard
,
partly
to
taste
the
old
flavor
of
discourse
about
horse
,
sport
,
and
thing
in
general
,
consider
from
a
point
of
view
which
be
not
strenuously
correct
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
out
hunt
once
this
season
,
have
have
no
horse
of
his
own
to
ride
,
and
have
go
from
place
to
place
chiefly
with
Mr.
Garth
in
his
gig
,
or
on
the
sober
cob
which
Mr.
Garth
could
lend
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
too
bad
<EOS>
,
Fred
begin
to
think
,
that
he
should
be
keep
in
the
trace
with
more
severity
than
if
he
have
be
a
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Mistress
Mary
 
it
will
be
rather
hard
work
to
learn
survey
and
draw
plan
than
it
would
have
be
to
write
sermon
,
"
he
have
say
,
wish
her
to
appreciate
what
he
go
through
for
her
sake
;
"
and
as
to
Hercules
and
Theseus
,
they
be
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
sport
,
and
never
learn
to
write
a
bookkeepe
hand
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
Mary
be
out
of
the
way
for
a
little
while
,
Fred
,
like
any
other
strong
dog
who
can
not
slip
his
collar
,
have
pull
up
the
staple
of
his
chain
and
make
a
small
escape
,
not
of
course
mean
to
go
fast
or
far
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
play
at
billiard
,
but
he
be
determine
not
to
bet
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
money
just
now
,
Fred
have
in
his
mind
the
heroic
project
of
save
almost
all
of
the
eighty
pound
that
Mr.
Garth
offer
him
,
and
return
it
,
which
he
could
easily
do
by
give
up
all
futile
money
-
spending
,
since
he
have
a
superfluous
stock
of
clothe
,
and
no
expense
in
his
board
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
way
he
could
,
in
one
year
,
go
a
good
way
towards
repay
the
ninety
pound
of
which
he
have
deprive
Mrs.
Garth
,
unhappily
at
a
time
when
she
need
that
sum
more
than
she
do
now
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
on
this
evening
,
which
be
the
fifth
of
his
recent
visit
to
the
billiard
-
room
,
Fred
have
,
not
in
his
pocket
,
but
in
his
mind
,
the
ten
pound
which
he
mean
to
reserve
for
himself
from
his
half
-
year
's
salary
(
have
before
him
the
pleasure
of
carry
thirty
to
Mrs.
Garth
when
Mary
be
likely
to
be
come
home
again
)
 
<EOS>
he
have
those
ten
pound
in
his
mind
as
a
fund
from
which
he
may
risk
something
,
if
there
be
a
chance
of
a
good
bet
.
 
<EOS>
why
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
when
sovereign
be
fly
about
,
why
should
not
he
catch
a
few
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
go
far
along
that
road
again
;
but
a
man
like
to

himself
,
and
man
of
pleasure
generally
,
what
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
mischief
if
he
choose
,
and
that
if
he
abstain
from
make
himself
ill
,
or
beggar
himself
,
or
talk
with
the
utmost
looseness
which
the
narrow
limit
of
human
capacity
will
allow
,
it
be
not
because
he
be
a
spooney
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
do
not
enter
into
formal
reason
,
which
be
a
very
artificial
,
inexact
way
of
represent
the
tingle
return
of
old
habit
,
and
the
caprice
of
young
blood
:
but
there
be
lurk
in
him
a
prophetic
sense
that
evening
,
that
when
he
begin
to
play
he
should
also
begin
to
bet
 
that
he
should
enjoy
some
punch
-
drinking
,
and
in
general
prepare
himself
for
feel
"
rather
seedy
"
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
such
indefinable
movement
that
action
often
begin
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
last
thing
likely
to
have
enter
Fred
's
expectation
<EOS>
be
that
he
should
see
his
brother
-
in
-
law
lydgate
 
of
whom
he
have
never
quite
drop
the
old
opinion
that
he
be
a
prig
,
and
tremendously
conscious
of
his
superiority
 
look
excite
and
bet
,
just
as
he
himself
may
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
feel
a
shock
great
than
he
could
quite
account
for
by
the
vague
knowledge
that
Lydgate
be
in
debt
,
and
that
his
father
have
refuse
to
help
him
;
and
his
own
inclination
to
enter
into
the
play
be
suddenly
check
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
reversal
of
attitude
:
Fred
's
blond
face
and
blue
eye
,
usually
bright
and
careless
,
ready
to
give
attention
to
anything
that
hold
out
a
promise
of
amusement
,
look
involuntarily
grave
and
almost
embarrassed
as
if
by
the
sight
of
something
unfitting
;
while
Lydgate
,
who
have
habitually
an
air
of
self
-
possess
strength
,
and
a
certain
meditativeness
that
seem
to
lie
behind
his
most
observant
attention
,
be
act
,
watch
,
speak
with
that
excite
narrow
consciousness
which
remind
one
of
an
animal
with
fierce
eye
and
retractile
claw
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
,
by
bet
on
his
own
stroke
,
have
win
sixteen
pound
;
but
young
Hawley
's
arrival
have
change
the
poise
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
first
-
rate
stroke
himself
,
and
begin
to
bet
against
Lydgate
's
stroke
,
the
strain
of
whose
nerve
be
thus
change
from
simple
confidence
in
his
own
movement
to
defy
another
person
's
doubt
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
defiance
be
more
exciting
than
the
confidence
,
but
it
be
less
sure
.
<EOS>
He
continue
to
bet
on
his
own
play
,
but
begin
often
to
fail
.
 
<EOS>
still
he
go
on
,
for
his
mind
be
as
utterly
narrow
into
that
precipitous
crevice
of
play
as
if
he
have
be
the
most
ignorant
lounger
there
.
<EOS>
Fred
observe
that
Lydgate
be
lose
fast
,
and
find
himself
in
the
new
situation
of
puzzle
his
brain
to
think
of
some
device
by
which
,
without
be
offensive
,
he
could
withdraw
Lydgate
's
attention
,
and
perhaps
suggest
to
him
a
reason
for
quit
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
that
other
be
observe
Lydgate
's
strange
unlikeness
to
himself
,
and
it
occur
to
him
that
merely
to
touch
his
elbow
and
call
him
aside
for
a
moment
may
rouse
him
from
his
absorption
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
nothing
clever
than
the
dare
improbability
of
say
that
he
want
to
see
Rosy
,
and
wish
to
know
if
she
be
at
home
this
evening
;
and
he
be
go
desperately
to
carry
out
this
weak
device
,
when
a
waiter
come
up
to
him
with
a
message
,
say
that
Mr.
Farebrother
be
below
,
and
beg
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
be
surprised
,
not
quite
comfortably
,
but
send
word
that
he
would
be
down
immediately
,
he
go
with
a
new
impulse
up
to
Lydgate
,
say
,
"
Can
I
speak
to
you
a
moment
?
"
and
draw
him
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farebrother
have
just
send
up
a
message
to
say
that
he
want
to
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
below
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
may
like
to
know
he
be
there
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
have
simply
snatch
up
this
pretext
for
speak
,
because
he
could
not
say
,
"
You
be
lose
confoundedly
,
and
be
make
everybody
stare
at
you
;
you
have
better
come
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
inspiration
could
hardly
have
serve
him
better
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
not
before
see
that
Fred
be
present
,
and
his
sudden
appearance
with
an
announcement
of
Mr.
Farebrother
have
the
effect
of
a
sharp
concussion
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
lydgate
;
"
I
have
nothing
particular
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
 
the
game
be
up
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
go
 
<EOS>
I
come
in
just
to
see
Bambridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bambridge
be
over
there
,
but
he
be
make
a
row
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
be
ready
for
business
.
 
<EOS>
come
down
with
me
to
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
he
be
go
to
blow
me
up
,
and
you
will
shield
me
,
"
say
Fred
,
with
some
adroitness
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
feel
shame
,
but
could
not
bear
to
act
as
if
he
feel
it
,
by
refuse
to
see
Mr.
Farebrother
;
and
he
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
merely
shake
hand
,
however
,
and
speak
of
the
frost
;
and
when
all
three
have
turn
into
the
street
,
the
Vicar
seem
quite
willing
to
say
good
-
by
to
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
His
present
purpose
be
clearly
to
talk
with
Fred
alone
,
and
he
say
,
kindly
,
"
I
disturb
you
,
young
gentleman
,
because
I
have
some
press
business
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
walk
with
me
to
St.
Botolph
's
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
night
,
the
sky
thick
with
star
,
and
Mr.
Farebrother
propose
that
they
should
make
a
circuit
to
the
old
church
by
the
London
road
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
thing
he
say
be
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lydgate
never
go
to
the
Green
Dragon
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
do
I
,
"
say
Fred
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
say
that
he
go
to
see
Bambridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
play
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fred
have
not
mean
to
tell
this
,
but
he
be
oblige
now
to
say
,
"
yes
,
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
it
be
an
accidental
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
him
there
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
go
often
yourself
,
then
,
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
about
five
or
six
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
some
good
reason
for
give
up
the
habit
of
go
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
all
about
it
,
"
say
Fred
,
not
like
to
be
catechise
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
make
a
clean
breast
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
give
me
a
warrant
to
speak
about
the
matter
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
understand
between
us
,
be
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
that
we
be
on
a
footing
of
open
friendship
<EOS>
:
I
have
listen
to
you
,
and
you
will
be
willing
to
listen
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
take
my
turn
in
talk
a
little
about
myself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
under
the
deep
obligation
to
you
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
"
say
Fred
,
in
a
state
of
uncomfortable
surmise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
affect
to
deny
that
you
be
under
some
obligation
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
go
to
confess
to
you
,
Fred
,
that
I
have
be
tempt
to
reverse
all
that
by
keep
silence
with
you
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
when
somebody
say
to
me
,
"
Young
Vincy
have
take
to
be
at
the
billiard
-
table
every
night
again
 
he
will
not
bear
the
curb
long
;
"
I
be
tempt
to
do
the
opposite
of
what
I
be
do
 
to
hold
my
tongue
and
wait
while
you
go
down
the
ladder
again
,
bet
first
<EOS>
and
then
 
"
  
"
I
have
not
make
any
bet
,
"
say
Fred
,
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
glad
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
my
prompting
be
to
look
on
and
see
you
take
the
wrong
turning
,
wear
out
Garth
's
patience
,
and
lose
the
good
opportunity
of
your
life
 
the
opportunity
which
you
make
some
rather
difficult
effort
to
secure
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
guess
the
feeling
which
raise
that
temptation
in
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
know
that
the
satisfaction
of
your
affection
stand
in
the
way
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
seem
to
wait
for
a
recognition
of
the
fact
;
and
the
emotion
perceptible
in
the
tone
of
his
fine
voice
give
solemnity
to
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
feeling
could
quell
Fred
's
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
be
expect
to
give
her
up
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
:
it
be
not
a
case
for
any
pretence
of
generosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
clearly
not
,
when
her
affection
meet
yours
.
 
<EOS>
but
relation
of
this
sort
,
even
when
they
be
of
long
standing
,
be
always
liable
to
change
.
<EOS>
I
can
easily
conceive
that
you
may
act
in
a
way
to
loosen
the
tie
she
feel
towards
you
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
remember
that
she
be
only
conditionally
bind
to
you
 
and
that
in
that
case
,
another
man
,
who
may
flatter
himself
that
he
have
a
hold
on
her
regard
,
may
succeed
in
win
that
firm
place
in
her
love
as
well
as
respect
which
you
have
let
slip
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
easily
conceive
such
a
result
,
"
repeat
Mr.
Farebrother
,
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
companionship
of
ready
sympathy
,
which
may
get
the
advantage
even
over
the
long
association
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Fred
that
if
Mr.
Farebrother
have
have
a
beak
and
talon
instead
of
his
very
capable
tongue
,
his
mode
of
attack
could
hardly
be
more
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
horrible
conviction
that
behind
all
this
hypothetic
statement
there
be
a
knowledge
of
some
actual
change
in
Mary
's
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
know
it
may
easily
be
all
up
with
me
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
troubled
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
begin
to
compare
 
"
 
<EOS>
He
break
off
,
not
like
to
betray
all
he
feel
,
and
then
say
,
by
the
help
of
a
little
bitterness
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
be
friendly
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
be
;
that
be
why
we
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
have
a
strong
disposition
to
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
say
to
myself
,
"
if
there
be
a
likelihood
of
that
youngster
do
himself
harm
,
why
should
you
interfere
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
you
worth
as
much
as
he
be
,
and
do
not
your
sixteen
year
over
and
above
his
,
in
which
you
have
go
rather
hungry
,
give
you
more
right
to
satisfaction
than
he
have
?
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
chance
of
his
go
to
the
dog
,
let
him
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
could
nohow
hinder
it
 
and
do
you
take
the
benefit
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
there
be
a
pause
,
in
which
Fred
be
seize
by
a
most
uncomfortable
chill
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
come
next
?
 
<EOS>
He
dread
to
hear
that
something
have
be
say
to
Mary
 
<EOS>
he
feel
as
if
he
be
listen
to
a
threat
rather
than
a
warning
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Vicar
begin
again
there
be
a
change
in
his
tone
like
the
encourage
transition
to
a
major
key
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
once
mean
better
than
that
,
and
I
be
come
back
to
my
old
intention
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
could
hardly
_
secure
myself
_
in
it
better
,
Fred
,
than
by
tell
you
just
what
have
go
on
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
do
you
understand
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
make
the
happiness
of
her
life
and
your
own
,
and
if
there
be
any
chance
that
a
word
of
warning
from
me
may
turn
aside
any
risk
to
the
contrary
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
have
utter
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
drop
in
the
Vicar
's
voice
when
he
speak
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
He
pause
 
they
be
stand
on
a
patch
of
green
where
the
road
diverge
towards
St.
Botolph
's
,
and
he
put
out
his
hand
,
as
if
to
imply
that
the
conversation
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
be
move
quite
newly
.
 
<EOS>
some
one
highly
susceptible
to
the
contemplation
of
a
fine
act
have
say
,
that
it
produce
a
sort
of
regenerate
shudder
through
the
frame
,
and
make
one
feel
ready
to
begin
a
new
life
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
degree
of
that
effect
be
just
then
present
in
Fred
Vincy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
be
worthy
,
"
he
say
,
break
off
before
he
could
say
"
of
you
as
well
as
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
meanwhile
Mr.
Farebrother
have
gather
the
impulse
to
say
something
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
imagine
that
I
believe
there
be
at
present
any
decline
in
her
preference
of
you
,
Fred
.
 
<EOS>
set
your
heart
at
rest
,
that
if
you
keep
right
,
other
thing
will
keep
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
do
,
"
Fred
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
anything
that
seem
worth
say
 
<EOS>
only
I
will
try
that
your
goodness
shall
not
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
good
-
by
,
and
God
bless
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
that
way
they
part
.
 
<EOS>
but
both
of
them
walk
about
a
long
while
before
they
go
out
of
the
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
much
of
Fred
's
rumination
may
be
sum
up
in
the
word
,
"
It
certainly
would
have
be
a
fine
thing
for
her
to
marry
Farebrother
 
<EOS>
but
if
she
love
me

I
be
a
good

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Mr.
Farebrother
's
may
be
concentrate
into
a
single
shrug
and
one
little
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
think
of
the
part
one
little
woman
can
play
in
the
life
of
a
man
,
so
that
to
renounce
her
may
be
a
very
good
imitation
of
heroism
,
and
to
win
her
may
be
a
discipline
!
"
        
<EOS>
now
be
there
civil
war
within
the
soul
:
    
<EOS>
Resolve
be
thrust
from
off
the
sacred
throne
    
by
clamorous
need
,
and
pride
the
grand
-
vizier
    
make
humble
compact
,
play
the
supple
part
    
of
envoy
and
deft
-
tongue
apologist
    
for
hungry
rebel
.
  
<EOS>
happily
Lydgate
have
end
by
lose
in
the
billiard
-
room
,
and
bring
away
no
encouragement
to
make
a
raid
on
luck
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
feel
unmixed
disgust
with
himself
the
next
day
when
he
have
to
pay
four
or
five
pound
over
and
above
his
gain
,
and
he
carry
about
with
him
a
most
unpleasant
vision
of
the
figure
he
have
make
,
not
only
rub
elbow
with
the
man
at
the
Green
Dragon
but
behave
just
as
they
do
.
<EOS>
a
philosopher
fall
to
betting
be
hardly
distinguishable
from
a
Philistine
under
the
same
circumstance
:
the
difference
will
chiefly
be
find
in
his
subsequent
reflection
,
and
Lydgate
chew
a
very
disagreeable
cud
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
His
reason
tell
him
how
the
affair
may
have
be
magnify
into
ruin
by
a
slight
change
of
scenery
 
if
it
have
be
a
gambling
-
house
that
he
have
turn
into
,
where
chance
could
be
clutch
with
both
hand
instead
of
be
pick
up
with
thumb
and
fore
-
finger
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
though
reason
strangle
the
desire
to
gamble
,
there
remain
the
feeling
that
,
with
an
assurance
of
luck
to
the
needful
amount
,
he
would
have
like
to
gamble
,
rather
than
take
the
alternative
which
be
begin
to
urge
itself
as
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
that
alternative
be
to
apply
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
so
many
time
boast
both
to
himself
and
other
that
he
be
totally
independent
of
Bulstrode
,
to
whose
plan
he
have
lend
himself
solely
because
they
enable
him
to
carry
out
his
own
idea
of
professional
work
and
public
benefit
 
<EOS>
he
have
so
constantly
in
their
personal
intercourse
<EOS>
have
his
pride
sustain
by
the
sense
that
he
be
make
a
good
social
use
of
this
predominate
banker
,
whose
opinion
he
think
contemptible
and
whose
motive
often
seem
to
him
an
absurd
mixture
of
contradictory
impression
 
that
he
have
be
create
for
himself
strong
ideal
obstacle
to
the
proffering
of
any
considerable
request
to
him
on
his
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
early
in
March
his
affair
be
at
that
pass
in
which
man
begin
to
say
that
their
oath
be
deliver
in
ignorance
,
and
to
perceive
that
the
act
which
they
have
call
impossible
to
them
be
become
manifestly
possible
.
 
<EOS>
with
Dover
's
ugly
security
soon
to
be
put
in
force
,
with
the
proceed
of
his
practice
immediately
absorb
in
pay
back
debt
,
and
with
the
chance
,
if
the
bad
be
know
,
of
daily
supply
be
refuse
on
credit
,
above
all
with
the
vision
of
Rosamond
's
hopeless
discontent
continually
haunt
him
,
Lydgate
have
begin
to
see
that
he
should
inevitably
bend
himself
to
ask
help
from
somebody
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
have
consider
whether
he
should
write
to
Mr.
Vincy
;
but
on
question
Rosamond
he
find
that
,
as
he
have
suspect
,
she
have
already
apply
twice
to
her
father
,
the
last
time
be
since
the
disappointment
from
Sir
Godwin
;
and
papa
have
say
that
Lydgate
must
look
out
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Papa
say
he
have
come
,
with
one
bad
year
after
another
,
to
trade
more
and
more
on
borrow
capital
,
and
have
have
to
give
up
many
indulgence
;
he
could
not
spare
a
single
hundred
from
the
charge
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
let
Lydgate
ask
Bulstrode
:
<EOS>
they
have
always
be
hand
and
glove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
Lydgate
himself
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
must
end
by
ask
for
a
free
loan
,
his
relation
with
Bulstrode
,
more
at
least
than
with
any
other
man
,
may
take
the
shape
of
a
claim
which
be
not
purely
personal
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
have
indirectly
help
to
cause
the
failure
of
his
practice
,
and
have
also
be
highly
gratify
by
get
a
medical
partner
in
his
plan
:
 
but
who
among
us
ever
reduce
himself
to
the
sort
of
dependence
in
which
Lydgate
now
stand
,
without
try
to
believe
that
he
have
claim
which
diminish
the
humiliation
of
ask
?
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
of
late
there
have
seem
to
be
a
new
languor
of
interest
in
Bulstrode
about
the
hospital
;
but
his
health
have
get
bad
,
and
show
sign
of
a
deep
-
seat
nervous
affection
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
respect
he
do
not
appear
to
be
change
:
he
have
always
be
highly
polite
,
but
Lydgate
have
observe
in
him
from
the
first
a
marked
coldness
about
his
marriage
and
other
private
circumstance
,
a
coldness
which
he
have
hitherto
prefer
to
any
warmth
of
familiarity
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
defer
the
intention
from
day
to
day
,
his
habit
of
act
on
his
conclusion
be
make
infirm
by
his
repugnance
to
every
possible
conclusion
and
its
consequent
act
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
Mr.
Bulstrode
often
,
but
he
do
not
try
to
use
any
occasion
for
his
private
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
moment
he
think
,
"
I
will
write
a
letter
:
I
prefer
that
to
any
circuitous
talk
;
"
at
another
he
think
,
"
no
;
if
I
be
talk
to
him
,
I
could
make
a
retreat
before
any
sign
of
disinclination
.
"
  
<EOS>
still
the
day
pass
and
no
letter
be
write
,
no
special
interview
seek
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
shrinking
from
the
humiliation
of
a
dependent
attitude
towards
Bulstrode
,
he
begin
to
familiarize
his
imagination
with
another
step
even
more
unlike
his
remembered
self
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
spontaneously
to
consider
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
carry
out
that
puerile
notion
of
Rosamond
's
which
have
often
make
him
angry
,
namely
,
that
they
should
quit
Middlemarch
without
see
anything
beyond
that
preface
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
come
 
"
Would
any
man
buy
the
practice
of
me
even
now
,
for
as
little
as
it
be
worth
?
 
<EOS>
then
the
sale
may
happen
as
a
necessary
preparation
for
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
against
his
taking
this
step
,
which
he
still
feel
to
be
a
contemptible
relinquishment
of
present
work
,
a
guilty
turning
aside
from
what
be
a
real
and
may
be
a
widen
channel
for
worthy
activity
,
to
start
again
without
any
justified
destination
,
there
be
this
obstacle
,
that
the
purchaser
,
if
procurable
at
all
,
may
not
be
quickly
forthcoming
.
 
<EOS>
and
afterwards
?
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
in
a
poor
lodging
,
though
in
the
large
city
or
most
distant
town
,
would
not
find
the
life
that
could
save
her
from
gloom
,
and
save
him
from
the
reproach
of
have
plunge
her
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
when
a
man
be
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
in
his
fortune
,
he
may
stay
a
long
while
there
in
spite
of
professional
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
british
climate
there
be
no
incompatibility
between
scientific
insight
and
furnished
lodging
:
the
incompatibility
be
chiefly
between
scientific
ambition
and
a
wife
who
object
to
that
kind
of
residence
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
the
midst
of
his
hesitation
,
opportunity
come
to
decide
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
note
from
Mr.
Bulstrode
request
Lydgate
to
call
on
him
at
the
Bank
.
<EOS>
a
hypochondriacal
tendency
have
show
itself
in
the
banker
's
constitution
of
late
;
and
a
lack
of
sleep
,
which
be
really
only
a
slight
exaggeration
of
an
habitual
dyspeptic
symptom
,
have
be
dwell
on
by
him
as
a
sign
of
threaten
insanity
.
 
<EOS>
He
want
to
consult
Lydgate
without
delay
on
that
particular
morning
,
although
he
have
nothing
to
tell
beyond
what
he
have
tell
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
eagerly
to
what
Lydgate
have
to
say
in
dissipation
of
his
fear
,
though
this
too
be
only
repetition
;
and
this
moment
in
which
Bulstrode
be
receive
a
medical
opinion
with
a
sense
of
comfort
,
seem
to
make
the
communication
of
a
personal
need
to
him
easy
than
it
have
be
in
Lydgate
's
contemplation
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
insist
that
it
would
be
well
for
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
relax
his
attention
to
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
see
how
any
mental
strain
,
however
slight
,
may
affect
a
delicate
frame
,
"
say
Lydgate
at
that
stage
of
the
consultation
when
the
remark
tend
to
pass
from
the
personal
to
the
general
,
"
by
the
deep
stamp
which
anxiety
will
make
for
a
time
even
on
the
young
and
vigorous
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
naturally
very
strong
;
yet
I
have
be
thoroughly
shake
lately
by
an
accumulation
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
presume
that
a
constitution
in
the
susceptible
state
in
which
mine
at
present
be
,
would
be
especially
liable
to
fall
a
victim
to
cholera
,
if
it
visit
our
district
.
 
<EOS>
and
since
its
appearance
near
London
,
we
may
well
besiege
the
mercy
-
seat
for
our
protection
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
not
intend
to
evade
Lydgate
's
allusion
,
but
really
preoccupied
with
alarm
about
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
at
all
event
take
your
share
in
use
good
practical
precaution
for
the
town
,
and
that
be
the
good
mode
of
ask
for
protection
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
a
strong
distaste
for
the
broken
metaphor
and
bad
logic
of
the
banker
's
religion
,
somewhat
increase
by
the
apparent
deafness
of
his
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
mind
have
take
up
its
long
-
prepared
movement
towards
get
help
,
and
be
not
yet
arrest
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
the
town
have
do
well
in
the
way
of
cleansing
,
and
find
appliance
;
and
I
think
that
if
the
cholera
should
come
,
even
our
enemy
will
admit
that
the
arrangement
in
the
Hospital
be
a
public
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
truly
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
with
some
coldness
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
regard
to
what
you
say
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
about
the
relaxation
of
my
mental
labor
,
I
have
for
some
time
be
entertain
a
purpose
to
that
effect
 
a
purpose
of
a
very
decide
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
contemplate
at
least
a
temporary
withdrawal
from
the
management
of
much
business
,
whether
benevolent
or
commercial
.
 
<EOS>
also
I
think
of
change
my
residence
for
a
time
:
<EOS>
probably
I
shall
close
or
let
"
the
Shrubs
,
"
and
take
some
place
near
the
coast
 
under
advice
of
course
as
to
salubrity
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
a
measure
which
you
would
recommend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
fall
backward
in
his
chair
,
with
ill
-
repressed
impatience
under
the
banker
's
pale
earnest
eye
and
intense
preoccupation
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
for
some
time
feel
that
I
should
open
this
subject
with
you
in
relation
to
our
Hospital
,
"
continue
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
"
under
the
circumstance
I
have
indicate
,
of
course
I
must
cease
to
have
any
personal
share
in
the
management
,
and
it
be
contrary
to
my
view
of
responsibility
to
continue
a
large
application
of
mean
to
an
institution
which
I
can
not
watch
over
and
to
some
extent
regulate
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
,
in
case
of
my
ultimate
decision
to
leave
Middlemarch
,
consider
that
I
withdraw
other
support
to
the
New
Hospital
than
that
which
will
subsist
in
the
fact
that
I
chiefly
supply
the
expense
of
build
it
,
and
have
contribute
further
large
sum
to
its
successful
working
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
thought
,
when
Bulstrode
pause
accord
to
his
will
not
,
be
,
"
He
have
perhaps
be
lose
a
good
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
most
plausible
explanation
of
a
speech
which
have
cause
rather
a
startling
change
in
his
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
in
reply
    
"
the
loss
to
the
Hospital
can
hardly
be
make
up
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
hardly
,
"
return
Bulstrode
,
in
the
same
deliberate
,
silvery
tone
;
"
except
by
some
change
of
plan
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
person
who
may
be
certainly
count
on
as
willing
to
increase
her
contribution
be
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
an
interview
with
her
on
the
subject
,
and
I
have
point
out
to
her
,
as
I
be
about
to
do
to
you
,
that
it
will
be
desirable
to
win
a
more
general
support
to
the
New
Hospital
by
a
change
of
system
.
"
<EOS>
another
pause
,
but
Lydgate
do
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
change
I
mean
be
an
amalgamation
with
the
Infirmary
,
so
that
the
New
Hospital
shall
be
regard
as
a
special
addition
to
the
eld
institution
,
have
the
same
directing
board
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
,
also
,
that
the
medical
management
of
the
two
shall
be
combine
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
any
difficulty
as
to
the
adequate
maintenance
of
our
new
establishment
will
be
remove
;
the
benevolent
interest
of
the
town
will
cease
to
be
divide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
lower
his
eye
from
Lydgate
's
face
to
the
button
of
his
coat
as
he
again
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
that
be
a
good
device
as
to
way
and
mean
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
an
edge
of
irony
in
his
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
be
expect
to
rejoice
in
it
at
once
,
since
one
of
the
first
result
will
be
that
the
other
medical
man
will
upset
or
interrupt
my
method
,
if
it
be
only
because
they
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
myself
,
as
you
know
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
highly
value
the
opportunity
of
new
and
independent
procedure
which
you
have
diligently
employ
:
the
original
plan
,
I
confess
,
be
one
which
I
have
much
at
heart
,
under
submission
to
the
Divine
Will
.
 
<EOS>
but
since
providential
indication
demand
a
renunciation
from
me
,
I
renounce
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
show
a
rather
exasperating
ability
in
this
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
broken
metaphor
and
bad
logic
of
motive
which
have
stir
his
hearer
's
contempt
be
quite
consistent
with
a
mode
of
put
the
fact
which
make
it
difficult
for
Lydgate
to
vent
his
own
indignation
and
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
rapid
reflection
,
he
only
ask
    
"
what
do
Mrs.
Casaubon
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
further
statement
which
I
wish
to
make
to
you
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
who
have
thoroughly
prepare
his
ministerial
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
,
you
be
aware
,
a
woman
of
most
munificent
disposition
,
and
happily
in
possession
 
not
I
presume
of
great
wealth
,
but
of
fund
which
she
can
well
spare
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
inform
me
that
though
she
have
destine
the
chief
part
of
those
fund
to
another
purpose
,
she
be
willing
to
consider
whether
she
can
not
fully
take
my
place
in
relation
to
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
wish
for
ample
time
to
mature
her
thought
on
the
subject
,
and
I
have
tell
her
that
there
be
no
need
for
haste
 
<EOS>
that
,
in
fact
,
my
own
plan
be
not
yet
absolute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
be
ready
to
say
,
"
if
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
take
your
place
,
there
would
be
gain
,
instead
of
loss
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
a
weight
on
his
mind
which
arrest
this
cheerful
candor
.
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
"
I
suppose
,
then
,
that
I
may
enter
into
the
subject
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
precisely
;
that
be
what
she
expressly
desire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
decision
,
she
say
,
will
much
depend
on
what
you
can
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
at
present
<EOS>
:
she
be
,
I
believe
,
just
set
out
on
a
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
her
letter
here
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
draw
it
out
,
and
read
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
I
be
immediately
otherwise
engage
,
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
into
Yorkshire
with
Sir
James
and
Lady
Chettam
;
and
the
conclusion
I
come
to
about
some
land
which
I
be
to
see
there
may
affect
my
power
of
contribute
to
the
Hospital
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
there
be
no
haste
necessary
in
this
matter
;
but
I
wish
to
apprise
you
beforehand
of
what
may
possibly
occur
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
return
the
letter
to
his
side
-
pocket
,
and
change
his
attitude
as
if
his
business
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
whose
renew
hope
about
the
Hospital
only
make
him
more
conscious
of
the
fact
which
poison
his
hope
,
feel
that
his
effort
after
help
,
if
make
at
all
,
must
be
make
now
and
vigorously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
for
give
me
full
notice
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
firm
intention
in
his
tone
,
yet
with
an
interruptedness
in
his
delivery
which
show
that
he
speak
unwillingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
high
object
to
me
be
my
profession
,
and
I
have
identify
the
Hospital
with
the
good
use
I
can
at
present
make
of
my
profession
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
good
use
be
not
always
the
same
with
monetary
success
.
 
<EOS>
everything
which
have
make
the
Hospital
unpopular
have
help
with
other
cause
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
be
all
connected
with
my
professional
zeal
 
to
make
me
unpopular
as
a
practitioner
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
chiefly
patient
who
can
not
pay
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
them
best
,
if
I
have
nobody
to
pay
on
my
own
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lydgate
wait
a
little
,
but
Bulstrode
only
bow
,
look
at
him
fixedly
,
and
he
go
on
with
the
same
interrupted
enunciation
 
as
if
he
be
bite
an
objectional
leek
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
slip
into
money
difficulty
which
I
can
see
no
way
out
of
,
unless
some
one
who
trust
me
and
my
future
will
advance
me
a
sum
without
other
security
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
fortune
leave
when
I
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
prospect
of
money
from
my
own
family
.
 
<EOS>
My
expense
,
in
consequence
of
my
marriage
,
have
be
very
much
great
than
I
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
at
this
moment
be
that
it
would
take
a
thousand
pound
to
clear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
to
free
me
from
the
risk
of
have
all
my
good
sell
in
security
of
my
large
debt
 
as
well
as
to
pay
my
other
debt
 
and
leave
anything
to
keep
us
a
little
beforehand
with
our
small
income
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
my
wife
's
father
should
make
such
an
advance
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
mention
my
position
to
 
to
the
only
other
man
who
may
be
hold
to
have
some
personal
connection
with
my
prosperity
or
ruin

"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
hate
to
hear
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
speak
now
,
and
have
speak
with
unmistakable
directness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.

reply
without
haste
,
but
also
without
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>

I
be
grieve

My
advice
to
you

would
be

that
instead
of
involve
yourself
in
further
obligation

and
continue
a

you

that

of

state

in

conversation
with
Lydgate

have
be
determine
in
him
by
some
severe
experience
which
he
have
go
through
since
the
epoch
of
Mr.
Larcher
's
sale
,
when
Raffles
have
recognize
Will

and
when

His

would
return
to

have
be
justify

on

he

Bulstrode
be
at
home
to
receive

hinder
his

he
could
not
altogether
hinder
the
circumstance
of

Raffles
prove
more
unmanageable

he
have
show

to
be
in
his
former
appearance
,
his
chronic

shake

that
this
be
at

not

alternative

He
keep
him
in
his
own
room
for
the
evening
and
see
him
to
bed
,
raffle
all
the
while
amuse
himself
with
the
annoyance
he
be
cause
this
decent
and
highly
prosperous
fellow

an
amusement

be
indeed
more

that
there
be
a

sit

overhear
in

loud
and
plain
reference
to
past
fact
 
l
Mrs.
Bulstrode
should
be
even
tempt
to
listen
at
the
door

<EOS>
how
could
he
hinder
her
,
how
betray
his
terror
by
open
the
door
to
detect
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
of
honest
direct
habit

little
likely
to
take
so
low
a
course
in

to
arrive
at
painful
knowledge

but
fear
be
strong
than
the
calculation
of
probability

<EOS>
in
this
way
raffle
have
push
the
torture
too
far
,
and
produce
an
effect
which
have
not
be
in
his
plan

<EOS>
by
show
himself
hopelessly
unmanageable
he
have
make
Bulstrode
feel
that
a
strong
defiance
be
the
only
resource
leave
.
 
<EOS>
after
take
raffle
to
bed
that
night
the
banker
order
his
closed
carriage
to
be
ready
at
half

past
seven
the

at
six
o'clock
he

already
be
long
dress

spend

plead
his
motive
for
avert
the
bad
evil
if
in
anything
he
have
use
falsity
and
speak
what
be
not
true
before
God

<EOS>
for
Bulstrode
shrink
from
a
direct
lie
with
an
intensity
disproportionate
to
the
number
of
his
more
indirect
misdeed

many
of
these
misdeed
be
like
the
subtle
muscular
movement
which
be
not
take
account
of
in
the
consciousness
,
though
they
bring
about
the
end
that
we
fix
our
mind
on
and
desire

it
be
only
what
we
be
vividly
conscious
of
that
we
can
vividly
imagine
to
be
see
by
Omniscience

<EOS>
Bulstrode
carry
his
candle
to
the
bedside
of
Raffles
,
who
be
apparently
in
a
painful
dream
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
silent
,
hope
that
the
presence
of
the
light
would
serve
to
waken
the
sleeper
gradually
and
gently
,
for
he
fear
some
noise
as
the
consequence
of
a
too
sudden
awakening
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
watch
for
a
couple
of
minute
or
more
the
shuddering
and
panting
which
seem
likely
to
end
in
waking
,
when
Raffles
,
with
a
long
half
-
stifle
moan
,
start
up
and
stare
round
him
in
terror
,
tremble
and
gasping

he
make
no
further
noise

and
Bulstrode

set
down
the
candle
,
await
his
recovery

It
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later

a
cold
peremptoriness
of
manner

up

off

rarely

be
deliberate
on
this
speech

its
probable
effect
through
a
large
part

though

of
ten
mile
with
his
hate
companion
be
a
dreary
beginning
of
the
Christmas
day
;
but
at
the
end
of
the
drive
,
Raffles
have
recover
his
spirit
,
and
part
in
a
contentment
for
which
there
be
the
good
reason
that
the
banker
have
give
him
a
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
various
motive
urge
Bulstrode
to
this
open
-
handedness
,
but
he
do
not
himself
inquire
closely
into
all
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
stand
watch
Raffles
in
his
uneasy
sleep
,
it
have
certainly
enter
his
mind
that
the
man
have
be
much
shatter
since
the
first
gift
of
two
hundred
pound
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
take
care
to
repeat
the
incisive
statement
of
his
resolve
not
to
be
play
on
any
more
;
and
have
try
to
penetrate
raffle
with
the
fact
that
he
have
show
the
risk
of
bribe
him
to
be
quite
equal
to
the
risk
of
defy
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
,
free
from
his
repulsive
presence
,
Bulstrode
return
to
his
quiet
home
,
he
bring
with
him
no
confidence
that
he
have
secure
more
than
a
respite
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
he
have
have
a
loathsome
dream
,
and
could
not
shake
off
its
image
with
their
hateful
kindre
of
sensation
 
as
if
on
all
the
pleasant
surrounding
of
his
life
a
dangerous
reptile
have
leave
his
slimy
trace
.
  
<EOS>
who
can
know
how
much
of
his
most
inward
life
be
make
up
of
the
thought
he
believe
other
man
to
have
about
him
,
until
that
fabric
of
opinion
be
threaten
with
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
be
only
the
more
conscious
that
there
be
a
deposit
of
uneasy
presentiment
in
his
wife
's
mind
,
because
she
carefully
avoid
any
allusion
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
use
every
day
to
taste
the
flavor
of
supremacy
and
the
tribute
of
complete
deference
:
and
the
certainty
that
he
be
watch
or
measure
with
a
hidden
suspicion
of
his
have
some
discreditable
secret
,
make
his
voice
totter
when
he
be
speak
to
edification
.
 
<EOS>
Foreseeing
,
to
man
of
Bulstrode
's
anxious
temperament
,
be
often
bad
than
see
;
and
his
imagination
continually
heighten
the
anguish
of
an
imminent
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
imminent
;
for
if
his
defiance
of
Raffles
do
not
keep
the
man
away
 
and
though
he
pray
for
this
result
he
hardly
hope
for
it
 
<EOS>
the
disgrace
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
he
say
to
himself
that
,
if
permit
,
it
would
be
a
divine
visitation
,
a
chastisement
,
a
preparation
;
he
recoil
from
the
imagine
burning
;
and
he
judge
that
it
must
be
more
for
the
Divine
glory
that
he
should
escape
dishonor
.
 
<EOS>
that
recoil
have
at
last
urge
him
to
make
preparation
for
quit
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
if
evil
truth
must
be
report
of
him
,
he
would
then
be
at
a
less
scorch
distance
from
the
contempt
of
his
old
neighbor
;
and
in
a
new
scene
,
where
his
life
would
not
have
gather
the
same
wide
sensibility
,
the
tormentor
,
if
he
pursue
him
,
would
be
less
formidable
.
 
<EOS>
to
leave
the
place
finally
would
,
he
know
,
be
extremely
painful
to
his
wife
,
and
on
other
ground
he
would
have
prefer
to
stay
where
he
have
strike
root
.
 
<EOS>
hence
he
make
his
preparation
at
first
in
a
conditional
way
,
wish
to
leave
on
all
side
an
opening
for
his
return
after
brief
absence
,
if
any
favorable
intervention
of
Providence
should
dissipate
his
fear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
prepare
to
transfer
his
management
of
the
Bank
,
and
to
give
up
any
active
control
of
other
commercial
affair
in
the
neighborhood
,
on
the
ground
of
his
fail
health
,
but
without
exclude
his
future
resumption
of
such
work
.
 
<EOS>
the
measure
would
cause
him
some
add
expense
and
some
diminution
of
income
beyond
what
he
have
already
undergo
from
the
general
depression
of
trade
;
and
the
Hospital
present
itself
as
a
principal
object
of
outlay
on
which
he
could
fairly
economize
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
experience
which
have
determine
his
conversation
with
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
this
time
his
arrangement
have
most
of
them
go
no
farther
than
a
stage
at
which
he
could
recall
them
if
they
prove
to
be
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
He
continually
defer
the
final
step
;
in
the
midst
of
his
fear
,
like
many
a
man
who
be
in
danger
of
shipwreck
or
of
be
dash
from
his
carriage
by
runaway
horse
,
he
have
a
cling
impression
that
something
would
happen
to
hinder
the
bad
,
and
that
to
spoil
his
life
by
a
late
transplantation
may
be
over
-
hasty
 
especially
since
it
be
difficult
to
account
satisfactorily
to
his
wife
for
the
project
of
their
indefinite
exile
from
the
only
place
where
she
would
like
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
affair
Bulstrode
have
to
care
for
,
be
the
management
of
the
farm
at
Stone
Court
in
case
of
his
absence
;
and
on
this
as
well
as
on
all
other
matter
connect
with
any
house
and
land
he
possess
in
or
about
Middlemarch
,
he
have
consult
Caleb
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
like
every
one
else
who
have
business
of
that
sort
,
he
want
to
get
the
agent
who
be
more
anxious
for
his
employer
's
interest
than
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
Stone
Court
,
since
Bulstrode
wish
to
retain
his
hold
on
the
stock
,
and
to
have
an
arrangement
by
which
he
himself
could
,
if
he
choose
,
resume
his
favorite
recreation
of
superintendence
,
Caleb
have
advise
him
not
to
trust
to
a
mere
bailiff
,
but
to
let
the
land
,
stock
,
and
implement
yearly
,
and
take
a
proportionate
share
of
the
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
to
you
to
find
me
a
tenant
on
these
term
,
Mr.
Garth
?
"
say
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
will
you
mention
to
me
the
yearly
sum
which
would
repay
you
for
manage
these
affair
which
we
have
discuss
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
about
it
,
"
say
Caleb
,
in
his
blunt
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
how
I
can
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
that
he
have
to
consider
Fred
Vincy
's
future
,
Mr.
Garth
would
not
probably
have
be
glad
of
any
addition
to
his
work
,
of
which
his
wife
be
always
fear
an
excess
for
him
as
he
grow
old
.
<EOS>
but
on
quit
Bulstrode
after
that
conversation
,
a
very
alluring
idea
occur
to
him
about
this
say
letting
of
Stone
Court
.
 
<EOS>
what
if
Bulstrode
would
agree
to
his
place
Fred
Vincy
there
on
the
understanding
that
he
,
Caleb
Garth
,
should
be
responsible
for
the
management
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
excellent
schooling
for
Fred
;
he
may
make
a
modest
income
there
,
and
still
have
time
leave
to
get
knowledge
by
help
in
other
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
mention
his
notion
to
Mrs.
Garth
with
such
evident
delight
that
she
could
not
bear
to
chill
his
pleasure
by
express
her
constant
fear
of
his
undertaking
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
lad
would
be
as
happy
as
two
,
"
he
say
,
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
radiant
,
"
if
I
could
tell
him
it
be
all
settle
.
 
<EOS>
think
;
Susan
!
 
<EOS>
His
mind
have
be
run
on
that
place
for
year
before
old
Featherstone
die
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
as
pretty
a
turn
of
thing
as
could
be
that
he
should
hold
the
place
in
a
good
industrious
way
after
all
 
by
his
taking
to
business
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
likely
enough
Bulstrode
may
let
him
go
on
,
and
gradually
buy
the
stock
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
make
up
his
mind
<EOS>
,
I
can
see
,
whether
or
not
he
shall
settle
somewhere
else
as
a
lasting
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
better
pleased
with
a
notion
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
child
may
be
marry
by
-
and
-
by
,
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
give
any
hint
of
the
plan
to
Fred
,
until
you
be
sure
that
Bulstrode
would
agree
to
the
plan
?
"
say
Mrs.
Garth
,
in
a
tone
of
gentle
caution
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
as
to
marriage
,
Caleb
,
we
old
people
need
not
help
to
hasten
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Caleb
,
swinge
his
head
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
marriage
be
a
taming
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Fred
would
want
less
of
my
bit
and
bridle
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
say
nothing
till
I
know
the
ground
I
be
tread
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
speak
to
Bulstrode
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
his
early
opportunity
of
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
have
anything
but
a
warm
interest
in
his
nephew
Fred
Vincy
,
but
he
have
a
strong
wish
to
secure
Mr.
Garth
's
service
on
many
scatter
point
of
business
at
which
he
be
sure
to
be
a
considerable
loser
,
if
they
be
under
less
conscientious
management
.
 
<EOS>
on
that
ground
he
make
no
objection
to
Mr.
Garth
's
proposal
;
and
there
be
also
another
reason
why
he
be
not
sorry
to
give
a
consent
which
be
to
benefit
one
of
the
Vincy
family
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
have
hear
of
Lydgate
's
debt
,
have
be
anxious
to
know
whether
her
husband
could
not
do
something
for
poor
rosamond
,
and
have
be
much
trouble
on
learn
from
him
that
Lydgate
's
affair
be
not
easily
remediable
,
and
that
the
wise
plan
be
to
let
them
"
take
their
course
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bulstrode
have
then
say
for
the
first
time
,
"
I
think
you
be
always
a
little
hard
towards
my
family
,
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
I
have
no
reason
to
deny
any
of
my
relative
.
 
<EOS>
too
worldly
they
may
be
,
but
no
one
ever
have
to
say
that
they
be
not
respectable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Harriet
,
"
say
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
wince
under
his
wife
's
eye
,
which
be
fill
with
tear
,
"
I
have
supply
your
brother
with
a
great
deal
of
capital
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
expect
to
take
care
of
his
married
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
seem
to
be
true
,
and
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
remonstrance
subside
into
pity
for
poor
Rosamond
,
whose
extravagant
education
she
have
always
foresee
the
fruit
of
.
  
<EOS>
but
remember
that
dialogue
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
feel
that
when
he
have
to
talk
to
his
wife
fully
about
his
plan
of
quit
Middlemarch
,
he
should
be
glad
to
tell
her
that
he
have
make
an
arrangement
which
may
be
for
the
good
of
her
nephew
Fred
.
 
<EOS>
at
present
he
have
merely
mention
to
her
that
he
think
of
shut
up
the
Shrubs
for
a
few
month
,
and
take
a
house
on
the
Southern
Coast
.
  
<EOS>
hence
Mr.
Garth
get
the
assurance
he
desire
,
namely
,
that
in
case
of
Bulstrode
's
departure
from
Middlemarch
for
an
indefinite
time
,
Fred
Vincy
should
be
allow
to
have
the
tenancy
of
Stone
Court
on
the
term
propose
.
  
<EOS>
Caleb
be
so
elated
with
his
hope
of
this
"
neat
turn
"
be
give
to
thing
,
that
if
his
self
-
control
have
not
be
brace
by
a
little
affectionate
wifely
scold
,
he
would
have
betray
everything
to
Mary
,
want
"
to
give
the
child
comfort
.
"
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
restrain
himself
,
and
keep
in
strict
privacy
from
fred
certain
visit
which
he
be
make
to
Stone
Court
,
in
order
to
look
more
thoroughly
into
the
state
of
the
land
and
stock
,
and
take
a
preliminary
estimate
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
more
eager
in
these
visit
than
the
probable
speed
of
event
require
him
to
be
;
but
he
be
stimulate
by
a
fatherly
delight
in
occupy
his
mind
with
this
bit
of
probable
happiness
which
he
hold
in
store
like
a
hide
birthday
gift
for
Fred
and
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
the
whole
scheme
should
turn
out
to
be
a
castle
in
the
air
?
"
say
Mrs.
Garth
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
reply
Caleb
;
"
the
castle
will
tumble
about
nobody
's
head
.
"
        
<EOS>
"
if
thou
hast
hear
a

let
it

<EOS>
Ecclesiasticus
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
still
seat
in
his
manager
's
room
at
the
Bank
,
about
three
o'clock
of
the
same
day
on
which
he
have
receive
Lydgate
there
,
when
the
clerk
enter
to
say
that
his
horse
be
wait
,
and
also
that
Mr.
Garth
be
outside
and
beg
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean
,
"
say
Bulstrode
;
and
Caleb
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
sit
down
,
Mr.
Garth
,
"
continue
the
banker
,
in
his
suave
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
that
you
arrive
just
in
time
to
find
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
count
your
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
Caleb
,
gently
,
with
a
slow
swing
of
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
he
seat
himself
and
lay
his
hat
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
ground
,
lean
forward
and
let
his
long
finger
droop
between
his
leg
,
while
each
finger
move
in
succession
,
as
if
it
be
share
some
thought
which
fill
his
large
quiet
brow
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
like
every
one
else
who
know
Caleb
,
be
use
to
his
slowness
in
begin
to
speak
on
any
topic
which
he
feel
to
be
important
,
and
rather
expect
that
he
be
about
to
recur
to
the
buying
of
some
house
in
Blindman
's
Court
,
for
the
sake
of
pull
them
down
,
as
a
sacrifice
of
property
which
would
be
well
repay
by
the
influx
of
air
and
light
on
that
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
by
proposition
of
this
kind
that
Caleb
be
sometimes
troublesome
to
his
employer
;
but
he
have
usually
find
Bulstrode
ready
to
meet
him
in
project
of
improvement
,
and
they
have
get
on
well
together
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
speak
again
,
however
,
it
be
to
say
,
in
rather
a
subdue
voice
    
"
I
have
just
come
away
from
Stone
Court
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
nothing
wrong
there
,
I
hope
,
"
say
the
banker
;
"
I
be
there
myself
yesterday

<EOS>
Abel
have
do
well
with
the
lamb
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
"
say
Caleb
,
look
up
gravely
,
"
there
be
something
wrong
 
a
stranger
,
who
be
very
ill
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
He
want
a
doctor
,
and
I
come
to
tell
you
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
Raffles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
see
the
shock
of
his
word
pass
through
Bulstrode
's
frame
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
subject
the
banker
have
think
that
his
fear
be
too
constantly
on
the
watch
to
be
take
by
surprise
;
but
he
have
be
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
a
compassionate
tone
,
though
his
lip
tremble
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
how
he
come
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
him
myself
,
"
say
Caleb
,
quietly
 
"
take
him
up
in
my
gig
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
get
down
from
the
coach
,
and
be
walk
a
little
beyond
the
turning
from
the
toll
-
house
,
and
I
overtook
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
see
me
with
you
once
before
,
at
Stone
Court
,
and
he
ask
me
to
take
him
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
he
be
ill
:
it
seem
to
me
the
right
thing
to
do
,
to
carry
him
under
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
you
should
lose
no
time
in
get
advice
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Caleb
take
up
his
hat
from
the
floor
as
he
end
,
and
rise
slowly
from
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
whose
mind
be
very
active
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
yourself
oblige
me
,
Mr.
Garth
,
by
call
at
Mr.
Lydgate
's
as
you
pass
 
or
stay
!
<EOS>
he
may
at
this
hour
probably
be
at
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
first
send
my
man
on
the
horse
there
with
a
note
this
instant
,
and
then
I
will
myself
ride
to
Stone
Court
.
<EOS>
"
  
Bulstrode
quickly
write
a
note
,
and
go
out
himself
to
give
the
commission
to
his
man
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
return
,
Caleb
be
stand
as
before
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
,
hold
his
hat
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
in
Bulstrode
's
mind
the
dominant
thought
be
,
"
perhaps
raffle
only
speak
to
Garth
of
his
illness
.
 
<EOS>
Garth
may
wonder
,
as
he
must
have
do
before
,
at
this
disreputable
fellow
's
claim
intimacy
with
me
;
but
he
will
know
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
friendly
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
can
be
of
use
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
long
for
some
confirmation
of
this
hopeful
conjecture
,
but
to
have
ask
any
question
as
to
what
Raffles
have
say
or
do
would
have
be
to
betray
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
exceedingly
oblige
to
you
,
Mr.
Garth
,
"
he
say
,
in
his
usual
tone
of
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
servant
will
be
back
in
a
few
minute
,
and
I
shall
then
go
myself
to
see
what
can
be
do
for
this
unfortunate
man
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
have
some
other
business
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
pray
be
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Caleb
,
make
a
slight
gesture
with
his
right
hand
to
waive
the
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
say
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
that
I
must
request
you
to
put
your
business
into
some
other
hand
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
you
for
your
handsome
way
of
meet
me
 
about
the
letting
of
Stone
Court
,
and
all
other
business
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
a
sharp
certainty
enter
like
a
stab
into
Bulstrode
's
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
sudden
,
Mr.
Garth
,
"
be
all
he
could
say
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
"
say
Caleb
;
"
but
it
be
quite
fix
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
with
a
firmness
which
be
very
gentle
,
and
yet
he
could
see
that
Bulstrode
seem
to
cower
under
that
gentleness
,
his
face
look
dry
and
his
eye
swerve
away
from
the
glance
which
rest
on
him
.
<EOS>
Caleb
feel
a
deep
pity
for
him
,
but
he
could
have
use
no
pretexts
to
account
for
his
resolve
,
even
if
they
would
have
be
of
any
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
lead
to
this
,
I
apprehend
,
by
some
slander
concern
me
utter
by
that
unhappy
creature
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
anxious
now
to
know
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
that
I
act
upon
what
I
hear
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
conscientious
man
,
Mr.
Garth
 
<EOS>
a
man
,
I
trust
,
who
feel
himself
accountable
to
God
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
to
injure
me
by
be
too
ready
to
believe
a
slander
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
cast
about
for
plea
that
may
be
adapt
to
his
hearer
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
poor
reason
for
give
up
a
connection
which
I
think
I
may
say
will
be
mutually
beneficial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
injure
no
man
if
I
could
help
it
,
"
say
Caleb
;
"
even
if
I
think
God
wink
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
should
have
a
feeling
for
my
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
but
,
sir
 
I
be
oblige
to
believe
that
this
Raffles
have
tell
me
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
be
happy
in
work
with
you
,
or
profit
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
hurt
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
beg
you
to
seek
another
agent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
Mr.
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
at
least
claim
to
know
the
bad
that
he
have
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
know
what
be
the
foul
speech
that
I
be
liable
to
be
the
victim
of
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
a
certain
amount
of
anger
begin
to
mingle
with
his
humiliation
before
this
quiet
man
who
renounce
his
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
needless
,
"
say
Caleb
,
wave
his
hand
,
bow
his
head
slightly
,
and
not
swerve
from
the
tone
which
have
in
it
the
merciful
intention
to
spare
this
pitiable
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
he
have
say
to
me
will
never
pass
from
my
lip
,
unless
something
now
unknown
force
it
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
lead
a
harmful
life
for
gain
,
and
keep
other
out
of
their
right
by
deceit
,
to
get
the
more
for
yourself
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
you
repent
 
<EOS>
you
would
like
to
go
back
,
and
can
not
:
that
must
be
a
bitter
thing
"
 
Caleb
pause
a
moment
and
shake
his
head
 
<EOS>
"
it
be
not
for
me
to
make
your
life
harder
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
 
<EOS>
you
do
make
it
hard
to
me
,
"
say
Bulstrode
constrain
into
a
genuine
,
plead
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
make
it
hard
to
me
by
turn
your
back
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
force
to
do
,
"
say
Caleb
,
still
more
gently
,
lift
up
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
judge
you
and
say
,
he
be
wicked
,
and
I
be
righteous
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
everything
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
may
do
wrong
,
and
his
will
may
rise
clear
out
of
it
,
though
he
can
not
get
his
life
clear
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
bad
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
with
you
,
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
you

<EOS>
but
I
have
that
feeling
inside
me

that
I
can
not

on
work
with
you

<EOS>
that
be
all
,
Mr.
Bulstrode

<EOS>
everything
else
be
bury

so
far
as
my
will
go

I

you
good
-
day

"
  
<EOS>
"
one
moment
,
Mr.
Garth
!

"
say
Bulstrode
,
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
trust
then
to
your
solemn
assurance
that
you
will
not
repeat
either
to
man
or
woman

what
 
even
if
it
have
any
degree
of
truth

yet
a
malicious
representation

<EOS>
Caleb
's
wrath
be
stir
,
and
he
say
,
indignantly
    
"
why
should
I
have
say
it
if
I
do
not
mean
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
fear
of
you

<EOS>
such
tale
as
that
will
never
tempt
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
agitate
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
victim
of
this
abandon
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stop
a
bit
!
<EOS>
you
have
get
to
consider
whether
you
do
not
help
to
make
him
bad
,
when
you
profit
by
his
vice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
wrong
me
by
too
readily
believe
him
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
oppress
,
as
by
a
nightmare
,
with
the
inability
to
deny
flatly
what
Raffles
may
have
say
;
and
yet
feel
it
an
escape
that
Caleb
have
not
so
state
it
to
him
as
to
ask
for
that
flat
denial
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Caleb
,
lift
his
hand
deprecatingly
;
"
I
be
ready
to
believe
better
,
when
better
be
prove
.
 
<EOS>
I
rob
you
of
no
good
chance
.
<EOS>
as
to
speak
,
I
hold
it
a
crime
to
expose
a
man
's
sin
unless
I
be
clear
it
must
be
do
to
save
the
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
way
of
thinking
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
and
what
I
say
,
<EOS>
I
have
no
need
to
swear
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
some
hour
later
,
when
he
be
at
home
,
Caleb
say
to
his
wife
,
incidentally
,
that
he
have
have
some
little
difference
with
Bulstrode
,
and
that
in
consequence
,
he
have
give
up
all
notion
of
take
Stone
Court
,
and
indeed
have
resign
do
further
business
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
dispose
to
interfere
too
much
,
be
he
?
"
say
Mrs.
Garth
,
imagine
that
her
husband
have
be
touch
on
his
sensitive
point
,
and
not
be
allow
to
do
what
he
think
right
as
to
material
and
mode
of
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
Caleb
,
bow
his
head
and
wave
his
hand
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Garth
know
that
this
be
a
sign
of
his
not
intend
to
speak
further
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Bulstrode
,
he
have
almost
immediately
mount
his
horse
and
set
off
for
Stone
Court
,
be
anxious
to
arrive
there
before
Lydgate
.
  
<EOS>
His
mind
be
crowd
with
image
and
conjecture
,
which
be
a
language
to
his
hope
and
fear
,
just
as
we
hear
tone
from
the
vibration
which
shake
our
whole
system
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
humiliation
with
which
he
have
wince
under
Caleb
Garth
's
knowledge
of
his
past
and
rejection
of
his
patronage
,
alternate
with
and
almost
give
way
to
the
sense
of
safety
in
the
fact
that
Garth
,
and
no
other
,
have
be
the
man
to
whom
raffle
have
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
a
sort
of
earnest
that
Providence
intend
his
rescue
from
bad
consequence
;
the
way
be
thus
leave
open
for
the
hope
of
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
that
raffle
should
be
afflict
with
illness
,
that
he
should
have
be
lead
to
Stone
Court
rather
than
elsewhere
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
's
heart
flutter
at
the
vision
of
probability
which
these
event
conjure
up
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
should
turn
out
that
he
be
free
from
all
danger
of
disgrace
 
if
he
could
breathe
in
perfect
liberty
 
<EOS>
his
life
should
be
more
consecrate
than
it
have
ever
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
mentally
lift
up
this
vow
as
if
it
would
urge
the
result
he
long
for
 
he
try
to
believe
in
the
potency
of
that
prayerful
resolution
 
its
potency
to
determine
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
ought
to
say
,
"
Thy
will
be
do
;
"
and
he
say
it
often
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
intense
desire
remain
that
the
will
of
God
may
be
the
death
of
that
hate
man
.
  
<EOS>
yet
when
he
arrive
at
Stone
Court
he
could
not
see
the
change
in
Raffles
without
a
shock
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
his
pallor
and
feebleness
,
Bulstrode
would
have
call
the
change
in
him
entirely
mental
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
his
loud
tormenting
mood
,
he
show
an
intense
,
vague
terror
,
and
seem
to
deprecate
Bulstrode
's
anger
,
because
the
money
be
all
go
 
he
have
be
rob
 
<EOS>
it
have
half
of
it
be
take
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
only
come
here
because
he
be
ill
and
somebody
be
hunt
him
 
somebody
be
after
him
,
he
have
tell
nobody
anything
,
he
have
keep
his
mouth
shut
.
<EOS>
Bulstrode
,
not
know
the
significance
of
these
symptom
,
interpret
this
new
nervous
susceptibility
into
a
means
of
alarm
Raffles
into
true
confession
,
and
tax
him
with
falsehood
in
say
that
he
have
not
tell
anything
,
since
he
have
just
tell
the
man
who
take
him
up
in
his
gig
and
bring
him
to
Stone
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Raffles
deny
this
with
solemn
adjuration
;
the
fact
be
that
the
link
of
consciousness
be
interrupt
in
him
,
and
that
his
minute
terror
-
stricken
narrative
to
Caleb
Garth
have
be
deliver
under
a
set
of
visionary
impulse
which
have
drop
back
into
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
's
heart
sink
again
at
this
sign
that
he
could
get
no
grasp
over
the
wretched
man
's
mind
,
and
that
no
word
of
raffle
could
be
trust
as
to
the
fact
which
he
most
want
to
know
,
namely
,
whether
or
not
he
have
really
keep
silence
to
every
one
in
the
neighborhood
except
Caleb
Garth
.
 
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
have
tell
him
without
the
least
constraint
of
manner
that
since
Mr.
Garth
leave
,
Raffles
have
ask
her
for
beer
,
and
after
that
have
not
speak
,
seem
very
ill
.
 
<EOS>
on
that
side
it
may
be
conclude
that
there
have
be
no
betrayal
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Abel
think
,
like
the
servant
at
the
Shrubs
,
that
the
strange
man
belong
to
the
unpleasant
"
kin
"
who
be
among
the
trouble
of
the
rich
;
she
have
at
first
refer
the
kinship
to
Mr.
Rigg
,
and
where
there
be
property
leave
,
the
buzzing
presence
of
such
large
blue
-
bottle
seem
natural
enough
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
could
be
"
kin
"
to
Bulstrode
as
well
be
not
so
clear
,
but
Mrs.
Abel
agree
with
her
husband
that
there
be
"
no
knowing
,
"
a
proposition
which
have
a
great
deal
of
mental
food
for
her
,
so
that
she
shake
her
head
over
it
without
further
speculation
.
  
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
Lydgate
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
meet
him
outside
the
wainscote
parlor
,
where
Raffles
be
,
and
say
    
"
I
have
call
you
in
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
to
an
unfortunate
man
who
be
once
in
my
employment
,
many
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
he
go
to
America
,
and
return
<EOS>
I
fear
to
an
idle
dissolute
life
.
 
<EOS>
be
destitute
,
he
have
a
claim
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
slightly
connect
with
Rigg
,
the
former
owner
of
this
place
,
and
in
consequence
find
his
way
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
seriously
ill
:
apparently
his
mind
be
affect
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
bound
to
do
the
utmost
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
who
have
the
remembrance
of
his
last
conversation
with
Bulstrode
strongly
upon
him
,
be
not
dispose
to
say
an
unnecessary
word
to
him
,
and
bow
slightly
in
answer
to
this
account
;
but
just
before
enter
the
room
he
turn
automatically
and
say
,
"
what
be
his
name
?
"
 
to
know
name
be
as
much
a
part
of
the
medical
man
's
accomplishment
as
of
the
practical
politician
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
raffle
,
John
Raffles
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
who
hope
that
whatever
become
of
Raffles
,
Lydgate
would
never
know
any
more
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
thoroughly
examine
and
consider
the
patient
,
Lydgate
order
that
he
should
go
to
bed
,
and
be
keep
there
in
as
complete
quiet
as
possible
,
and
then
go
with
Bulstrode
into
another
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
serious
case
,
I
apprehend
,
"
say
the
banker
,
before
Lydgate
begin
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
 
and
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
half
dubiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
difficult
to
decide
as
to
the
possible
effect
of
long
-
stand
complication
;
but
the
man
have
a
robust
constitution
to
begin
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
expect
this
attack
to
be
fatal
,
though
of
course
the
system
be
in
a
ticklish
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
be
well
watch
and
attend
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
here
myself
,
"
say
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Abel
and
her
husband
be
inexperienced
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
easily
remain
here
for
the
night
,
if
you
will
oblige
me
by
take
a
note
for
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
that
be
hardly
necessary
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
seem
tame
and
terrified
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
become
more
unmanageable
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
man
here
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
more
than
once
stay
here
a
few
night
for
the
sake
of
seclusion
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
indifferently
;
"
I
be
quite
disposed
to
do
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Abel
and
her
husband
can
relieve
or
aid
me
,
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
need
give
my
direction
only
to
you
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
not
feel
surprised
at
a
little
peculiarity
in
Bulstrode
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
that
the
case
be
hopeful
?
"
say
Bulstrode
,
when
Lydgate
have
end
give
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
unless
there
turn
out
to
be
further
complication
,
such
as
I
have
not
at
present
detect
 
yes
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
pass
on
to
a
bad
stage
;
but
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
get
better
in
a
few
day
,
by
adhere
to
the
treatment
I
have
prescribe
.
 
<EOS>
there
must
be
firmness
.
<EOS>
remember
,
if
he
call
for
liquor
of
any
sort
,
not
to
give
them
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
man
in
his
condition
be
oftener
kill
by
treatment
than
by
the
disease
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
new
symptom
may
arise
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
come
again
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
after
wait
for
the
note
to
be
carry
to
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
Lydgate
ride
away
,
form
no
conjecture
,
in
the
first
instance
,
about
the
history
of
raffle
,
but
rehearse
the
whole
argument
,
which
have
lately
be
much
stir
by
the
publication
of
Dr.
Ware
's
abundant
experience
in
America
,
as
to
the
right
way
of
treat
case
of
alcoholic
poisoning
such
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
when
abroad
,
have
already
be
interested
in
this
question
<EOS>
:
he
be
strongly
convinced
against
the
prevalent
practice
of
allow
alcohol
and
persistently
administer
large
dose
of
opium
;
and
he
have
repeatedly
act
on
this
conviction
with
a
favorable
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
in
a
disease
state
,
"
he
think
,
"
but
there
be
a
good
deal
of
wear
in
him
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
be
an
object
of
charity
to
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
what
patch
of
hardness
and
tenderness
lie
side
by
side
in
man
's
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
seem
the
most
unsympathetic
fellow
I
ever
see
about
some
people
,
and
yet
he
have
take
no
end
of
trouble
,
and
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
,
on
benevolent
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
have
some
test
by
which
he
find
out
whom
Heaven
care
for
 
<EOS>
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
it
do
not
care
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
streak
of
bitterness
come
from
a
plenteous
source
,
and
keep
widen
in
the
current
of
his
thought
as
he
near
Lowick
Gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
there
since
his
first
interview
with
Bulstrode
in
the
morning
,
have
be
find
at
the
Hospital
by
the
banker
's
messenger
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
be
return
to
his
home
without
the
vision
of
any
expedient
in
the
background
which
leave
him
a
hope
of
raise
money
enough
to
deliver
him
from
the
come
destitution
of
everything
which
make
his
married
life
tolerable
 
everything
which
save
him
and
Rosamond
from
that
bare
isolation
in
which
they
would
be
force
to
recognize
how
little
of
a
comfort
they
could
be
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
more
bearable
to
do
without
tenderness
for
himself
than
to
see
that
his
own
tenderness
could
make
no
amend
for
the
lack
of
other
thing
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
suffering
of
his
own
pride
from
humiliation
past
and
to
come
be
keen
enough
,
yet
they
be
hardly
distinguishable
to
himself
from
that
more
acute
pain
which
dominate
them
 
the
pain
of
foreseeing
that
Rosamond
would
come
to
regard
him
chiefly
as
the
cause
of
disappointment
and
unhappiness
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
like
the
makeshift
of
poverty
,
and
they
have
never
before
enter
into
his
prospect
for
himself
;
but
he
be
begin
now
to
imagine
how
two
creature
who
love
each
other
,
and
have
a
stock
of
thought
in
common
,
may
laugh
over
their
shabby
furniture
,
and
their
calculation
how
far
they
could
afford
butter
and
egg
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
glimpse
of
that
poetry
seem
as
far
off
from
him
as
the
carelessness
of
the
golden
age
;
in
poor
Rosamond
's
mind
there
be
not
room
enough
for
luxury
to
look
small
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
down
from
his
horse
in
a
very
sad
mood
,
and
go
into
the
house
,
not
expect
to
be
cheer
except
by
his
dinner
,
and
reflect
that
before
the
evening
close
it
would
be
wise
to
tell
Rosamond
of
his
application
to
Bulstrode
and
its
failure
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
not
to
lose
time
in
prepare
her
for
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
dinner
wait
long
for
him
before
he
be
able
to
eat
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
on
enter
he
find
that
Dover
's
agent
have
already
put
a
man
in
the
house
,
and
when
he
ask
where
Mrs.
Lydgate
be
,
he
be
tell
that
she
be
in
her
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
up
and
find
her
stretch
on
the
bed
pale
and
silent
,
without
an
answer
even
in
her
face
to
any
word
or
look
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
by
the
bed
and
lean
over
her
say
with
almost
a
cry
of
prayer
    
"
forgive
me
for
this
misery
,
my
poor
Rosamond
!
 
<EOS>
let
us
only
love
one
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
silently
,
still
with
the
blank
despair
on
her
face
;
but
then
the
tear
begin
to
fill
her
blue
eye
,
and
her
lip
tremble
.
<EOS>
the
strong
man
have
have
too
much
to
bear
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
let
his
head
fall
beside
hers
and
sob
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
hinder
her
from
go
to
her
father
early
in
the
morning
 
<EOS>
it
seem
now
that
he
ought
not
to
hinder
her
from
do
as
she
please
.
 
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
she
come
back
,
and
say
that
papa
and
mamma
wish
her
to
go
and
stay
with
them
while
thing
be
in
this
miserable
state
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
say
he
could
do
nothing
about
the
debt
 
<EOS>
if
he
pay
this
,
there
would
be
half
-
a
-
dozen
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
better
come
back
home
again
till
Lydgate
have
get
a
comfortable
home
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
object
,
Tertius
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
as
you
like
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
thing
be
not
come
to
a
crisis
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
go
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Rosamond
;
"
I
shall
want
to
pack
my
clothe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
would
wait
a
little
longer
than
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
what
may
happen
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
bitter
irony
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
get
my
neck
break
,
and
that
may
make
thing
easy
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
Lydgate
's
misfortune
and
Rosamond
be
too
,
that
his
tenderness
towards
her
,
which
be
both
an
emotional
prompting
and
a
well
-
consider
resolve
,
be
inevitably
interrupt
by
these
outburst
of
indignation
either
ironical
or
remonstrant
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
them
totally
unwarranted
,
and
the
repulsion
which
this
exceptional
severity
excite
in
her
be
in
danger
of
make
the
more
persistent
tenderness
unacceptable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
do
not
wish
me
to
go
,
"
she
say
,
with
chill
mildness
;
"
why
can
you
not
say
so
,
without
that
kind
of
violence
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
until
you
request
me
to
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
say
no
more
,
but
go
out
on
his
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
bruise
and
shatter
,
and
there
be
a
dark
line
under
his
eye
which
Rosamond
have
not
see
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Tertius
have
a
way
of
take
thing
which
make
them
a
great
deal
bad
for
her
.
        
<EOS>
Our
deed
still
travel
with
us
from
afar
,
    
<EOS>
and
what
we
have
be
make
us
what
we
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
's
first
object
after
Lydgate
have
leave
Stone
Court
be
to
examine
Raffles
's
pocket
,
which
he
imagine
<EOS>
be
sure
to
carry
sign
in
the
shape
of
hotel
-
bill
of
the
place
he
have
stop
in
,
if
he
have
not
tell
the
truth
in
say
that
he
have
come
straight
from
Liverpool
because
he
be
ill
and
have
no
money
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
various
bill
cram
into
his
pocketbook
,
but
none
of
a
later
date
than
Christmas
at
any
other
place
,
except
one
,
which
bear
date
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
crumple
up
with
a
hand
-
bill
about
a
horse
-
fair
in
one
of
his
tail
-
pocket
,
and
represent
the
cost
of
three
day
'
stay
at
an
inn
at
Bilkley
,
where
the
fair
be
hold
 
a
town
at
least
forty
mile
from
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
the
bill
be
heavy
,
and
since
Raffles
have
no
luggage
with
him
,
it
seem
probable
that
he
have
leave
his
portmanteau
behind
in
payment
,
in
order
to
save
money
for
his
travel
fare
;
for
his
purse
be
empty
,
and
he
have
only
a
couple
of
sixpence
and
some
loose
penny
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
gather
a
sense
of
safety
from
these
indication
that
Raffles
have
really
keep
at
a
distance
from
Middlemarch
since
his
memorable
visit
at
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
distance
and
among
people
who
be
stranger
to
Bulstrode
,
what
satisfaction
could
there
be
to
Raffles
's
tormenting
,
self
-
magnify
vein
in
tell
old
scandalous
story
about
a
Middlemarch
banker
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
harm
if
he
do
talk
?
 
<EOS>
the
chief
point
now
be
to
keep
watch
over
him
as
long
as
there
be
any
danger
of
that
intelligible
raving
,
that
unaccountable
impulse
to
tell
,
which
seem
to
have
act
towards
Caleb
Garth
;
and
Bulstrode
feel
much
anxiety
lest
some
such
impulse
should
come
over
him
at
the
sight
of
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
up
alone
with
him
through
the
night
,
only
order
the
housekeeper
to
lie
down
in
her
clothe
,
so
as
to
be
ready
when
he
call
her
,
allege
his
own
indisposition
to
sleep
,
and
his
anxiety
to
carry
out
the
doctor
's
order
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
carry
them
out
faithfully
,
although
Raffles
be
incessantly
ask
for
brandy
,
and
declare
that
he
be
sink
away
 
that
the
earth
be
sink
away
from
under
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
restless
and
sleepless
,
but
still
quail
and
manageable
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
offer
of
the
food
order
by
Lydgate
,
which
he
refuse
,
and
the
denial
of
other
thing
which
he
demand
,
he
seem
to
concentrate
all
his
terror
on
Bulstrode
,
imploringly
deprecate
his
anger
,
his
revenge
on
him
by
starvation
,
and
declare
with
strong
oath
that
he
have
never
tell
any
mortal
a
word
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
even
this
Bulstrode
feel
that
he
would
not
have
like
Lydgate
to
hear
;
but
a
more
alarming
sign
of
fitful
alternation
in
his
delirium
be
,
that
in
-
the
morning
twilight
Raffles
suddenly
seem
to
imagine
a
doctor
present
,
address
him
and
declare
that
Bulstrode
want
to
starve
him
to
death
out
of
revenge
for
tell
,
when
he
never
have
tell
.
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
's
native
imperiousness
and
strength
of
determination
serve
him
well
.
 
<EOS>
this
delicate
-
looking
man
,
himself
nervously
perturb
,
find
the
need
stimulus
in
his
strenuous
circumstance
,
and
through
that
difficult
night
and
morning
,
while
he
have
the
air
of
an
animate
corpse
return
to
movement
without
warmth
,
hold
the
mastery
by
its
chill
impassibility
his
mind
<EOS>
be
intensely
at
work
think
of
what
he
have
to
guard
against
and
what
would
win
him
security
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
prayer
he
may
lift
up
,
whatever
statement
he
may
inwardly
make
of
this
man
's
wretched
spiritual
condition
,
and
the
duty
he
himself
be
under
to
submit
to
the
punishment
divinely
appoint
for
him
rather
than
to
wish
for
evil
to
another
 
through
all
this
effort
to
condense
word
into
a
solid
mental
state
,
there
pierce
and
spread
with
irresistible
vividness
the
image
of
the
event
he
desire
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
train
of
those
image
come
their
apology
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
see
the
death
of
Raffles
,
and
see
in
it
his
own
deliverance
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
removal
of
this
wretched
creature
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
impenitent
 
but
be
not
public
criminal
impenitent
?
 
<EOS>
yet
the
law
decide
on
their
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Should
Providence
in
this
case
award
death
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
sin
in
contemplate
death
as
the
desirable
issue
 
if
he
keep
his
hand
from
hasten
it
 
if
he
scrupulously
do
what
be
prescribe
.
 
<EOS>
even
here
there
may
be
a
mistake
:
human
prescription
be
fallible
thing
:
Lydgate
have
say
that
treatment
have
hasten
death
,
 
why
not
his
own
method
of
treatment
?
 
<EOS>
but
of
course
intention
be
everything
in
the
question
of
right
and
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
and
Bulstrode
set
himself
to
keep
his
intention
separate
from
his
desire
.
 
<EOS>
He
inwardly
declare
that
he
intend
to
obey
order
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
have
get
into
any
argument
about
the
validity
of
these
order
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
common
trick
of
desire
 
which
avail
itself
of
any
irrelevant
scepticism
,
find
large
room
for
itself
in
all
uncertainty
about
effect
,
in
every
obscurity
that
look
like
the
absence
of
law
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
do
obey
the
order
.
  
<EOS>
His
anxiety
continually
glance
towards
Lydgate
,
and
his
remembrance
of
what
have
take
place
between
them
the
morning
before
be
accompany
with
sensibility
which
have
not
be
rouse
at
all
during
the
actual
scene
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
then
care
but
little
about
Lydgate
's
painful
impression
with
regard
to
the
suggest
change
in
the
Hospital
,
or
about
the
disposition
towards
himself
which
what
he
hold
to
be
his
justifiable
refusal
of
a
rather
exorbitant
request
may
call
forth
.
<EOS>
He
recur
to
the
scene
now
with
a
perception
that
he
have
probably
make
Lydgate
his
enemy
,
and
with
an
awakened
desire
to
propitiate
him
,
or
rather
to
create
in
him
a
strong
sense
of
personal
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
He
regret
that
he
have
not
at
once
make
even
an
unreasonable
money
-
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
for
in
case
of
unpleasant
suspicion
,
or
even
knowledge
gather
from
the
raving
of
Raffles
,
Bulstrode
would
have
feel
that
he
have
a
defence
in
Lydgate
's
mind
by
have
confer
a
momentous
benefit
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
regret
have
perhaps
come
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
strange
,
piteous
conflict
in
the
soul
of
this
unhappy
man
,
who
have
long
for
year
to
be
well
than
he
be
 
who
have
take
his
selfish
passion
into
discipline
and
clothe
them
in
severe
robe
,
so
that
he
have
walk
with
them
as
a
devout
choir
,
till
now
that
a
terror
have
rise
among
them
,
and
they
could
chant
no
longer
,
but
throw
out
their
common
cry
for
safety
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
the
middle
of
the
day
before
Lydgate
arrive
:
he
have
mean
to
come
earlier
,
but
have
be
detain
,
he
say
;
and
his
shatter
look
be
notice
by
Balstrode
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
immediately
throw
himself
into
the
consideration
of
the
patient
,
and
inquire
strictly
into
all
that
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Raffles
be
bad
,
would
take
hardly
any
food
,
be
persistently
wakeful
and
restlessly
rave
;
but
still
not
violent
.
 
<EOS>
Contrary
to
Bulstrode
's
alarmed
expectation
,
he
take
little
notice
of
Lydgate
's
presence
,
and
continue
to
talk
or
murmur
incoherently
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
him
?
"
say
Bulstrode
,
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
symptom
be
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
less
hopeful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
still
think
he
may
come
round
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
go
to
stay
here
yourself
?
"
say
Lydgate
,
look
at
Bulstrode
with
an
abrupt
question
,
which
make
him
uneasy
,
though
in
reality
it
be
not
due
to
any
suspicious
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
so
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
govern
himself
and
speak
with
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bulstrode
be
advise
of
the
reason
which
detain
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Abel
and
her
husband
be
not
experience
enough
to
be
leave
quite
alone
,
and
this
kind
of
responsibility
be
scarcely
include
in
their
service
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
some
fresh
instruction
,
I
presume
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
chief
new
instruction
that
Lydgate
have
to
give
be
on
the
administration
of
extremely
moderate
dose
of
opium
,
in
case
of
the
sleeplessness
continue
after
several
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
the
precaution
of
bring
opium
in
his
pocket
,
and
he
give
minute
direction
to
Bulstrode
as
to
the
dose
,
and
the
point
at
which
they
should
cease
.
 
<EOS>
He
insist
on
the
risk
of
not
cease
;
and
repeat
his
order
that
no
alcohol
should
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
what
I
see
of
the
case
,
"
he
end
,
"
narcotism
be
the
only
thing
I
should
be
much
afraid
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
wear
through
even
without
much
food
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
strength
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
ill
yourself
,
Mr.
Lydgate
 
a
most
unusual
,
I
may
say
unprecedented
thing
in
my
knowledge
of
you
,
"
say
Bulstrode
,
show
a
solicitude
as
unlike
his
indifference
the
day
before
,
as
his
present
recklessness
about
his
own
fatigue
be
unlike
his
habitual
self
-
cherish
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
be
harass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
brusquely
,
hold
his
hat
,
and
ready
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
new

I
fear

Bulstrode

inquiringly

<EOS>
"
pray
be
seat

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you

"
say
Lydgate
,
with
some
hauteur
.
<EOS>
"
I
mention
to
you
yesterday
what
be
the
state
of
my
affair
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
add
,
except
that
the
execution
have
since
then
be
actually
put
into
my
house

<EOS>
one
can
tell
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
a
short
sentence

<EOS>
I
will
say
good
morning

"
  
<EOS>
"
stay
,
Mr.
Lydgate

stay
,
"

Bulstrode
;

I
have
be
reconsider
this
subject

I
be
yesterday
take
by
surprise
,
and
see
it
superficially
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bulstrode
be
anxious
for
her
niece
,
and
I
myself
should
grieve
at
a
calamitous
change
in
your
position

<EOS>
claim
on
me
be
numerous
,
but
on
reconsideration
,
I
esteem
it
right
that
I
should
incur
a
small
sacrifice
rather
than
leave
you
unaided
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
,
I
think
,
that
a
thousand
pound
would
suffice
entirely
to
free
you
from
your
burthen
,
and
enable
you
to
recover
a
firm
stand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
a
great
leap
of
joy
within
him
surmount
every
other
feeling
;
"
that
would
pay
all
my
debt
,
and
leave
me
a
little
on
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
set
about
economize
in
our
way
of
living
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
-
and
-
by
my
practice
may
look
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
wait
a
moment
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
I
will
draw
a
check
to
that
amount
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
aware
that
help
,
to
be
effectual
in
these
case
,
should
be
thorough
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
Bulstrode
write
,
Lydgate
turn
to
the
window
thinking
of
his
home
 
thinking
of
his
life
with
its
good
start
save
from
frustration
,
its
good
purpose
still
unbroken
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
give
me
a
note
of
hand
for
this
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
"
say
the
banker
,
advance
towards
him
with
the
check
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
you
may
be
in
circumstance
gradually
to
repay
me
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
I
have
pleasure
in
think
that
you
will
be
release
from
further
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
deeply
obliged
to
you
,
"

Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
restore
to
me
the
prospect
of
work
with
some
happiness
and
some
chance
of
good

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
him
a
very
natural
movement
in
Bulstrode
that
he
should
have
reconsider
his
refusal
:
it
correspond
with
the
more
munificent
side
of
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
put
his
hack
into
a
canter
,
that
he
may
get
the
soon
home
,
and
tell
the
good
news
to
Rosamond
,
and
get
cash
at
the
bank
to
pay
over
to
Dover
's
agent
,
there
cross
his
mind
,
with
an
unpleasant
impression
,
as
from
a
dark
-
winged
flight
of
evil
augury
across
his
vision
,
the
thought
of
that
contrast
in
himself
which
a
few
month
have
bring
 
that
he
should
be
overjoy
at
be
under
a
strong
personal
obligation
 
that
he
should
be
overjoy
at
get
money
for
himself
from
Bulstrode
.
  
<EOS>
the
banker
feel
that
he
have
do
something
to
nullify
one
cause
of
uneasiness
,
and
yet
he
be
scarcely
the
easy
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
measure
the
quantity
of
disease
motive
which
have
make
him
wish
for
Lydgate
's
good
-
will
,
but
the
quantity
be
none
the
less
actively
there
,
like
an
irritate
agent
in
his
blood
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
vow
,
and
yet
will
not
cast
away
the
mean
of
break
his
vow
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
that
he
distinctly
mean
to
break
it
?
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
;
<EOS>
but
the
desire
which
tend
to
break
it
be
at
work
in
him
dimly
,
and
make
their
way
into
his
imagination
,
and
relax
his
muscle
in
the
very
moment
when
he
be
tell
himself
over
again
the
reason
for
his
vow
.
 
<EOS>
Raffles
,
recover
quickly
,
return
to
the
free
use
of
his
odious
power
 
how
could
Bulstrode
wish
for
that
?
<EOS>
raffle
dead
be
the
image
that
bring
release
,
and
indirectly
he
pray
for
that
way
of
release
,
beseech
that
,
if
it
be
possible
,
the
rest
of
his
day
here
below
may
be
free
from
the
threat
of
an
ignominy
which
would
break
him
utterly
as
an
instrument
of
God
's
service
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
opinion
be
not
on
the
side
of
promise
that
this
prayer
would
be
fulfil
;
and
as
the
day
advance
,
Bulstrode
feel
himself
get
irritate
at
the
persistent
life
in
this
man
,
whom
he
would
fain
have
see
sink
into
the
silence
of
death
<EOS>
:
imperious
will
stir
murderous
impulse
towards
this
brute
life
,
over
which
will
,
by
itself
,
have
no
power

<EOS>
He
say
inwardly
that
he
be
get
too
much
worn
;
he
would
not
sit
up
with
the
patient
to
-
night
,
but
leave
him
to
Mrs.
Abel
,
who
,
if
necessary
,
could
call
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
at
six
o'clock
,
Raffles
,
have
have
only
fitful
perturbed
snatch
of
sleep
,
from
which
he
wake
with
fresh
restlessness
and
perpetual
cry
that
he
be
sink
away
,
Bulstrode
begin
to
administer
the
opium
accord
to
Lydgate
's
direction
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
more
he
call
Mrs.
Abel
and
tell
her
that
he
find
himself
unfit
for
further
watch
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
now
consign
the
patient
to
her
care
;
and
he
proceed
to
repeat
to
her
Lydgate
's
direction
as
to
the
quantity
of
each
dose
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Abel
have
not
before
know
anything
of
Lydgate
's
prescription
;
she
have
simply
prepare
and
bring
whatever
Bulstrode
order
,
and
have
do
what
he
point
out
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
now
to
ask
what
else
she
should
do
besides
administer
the
opium
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
at
present
,
except
the
offer
of
the
soup
or
the
soda
-
water
:
you
can
come
to
me
for
further
direction
.
 
<EOS>
unless
there
be
any
important
change
,
I
shall
not
come
into
the
room
again
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
will
ask
your
husband
for
help
if
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
bed
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
much
need
,
sir
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mrs.
Abel
,
"
and
to
take
something
more
strengthening
than
what
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
go
away
now
without
anxiety
as
to
what
Raffles
may
say
in
his
raving
,
which
have
take
on
a
muttering
incoherence
not
likely
to
create
any
dangerous
belief
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
must
risk
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
down
into
the
wainscote
parlor
first
,
and
begin
to
consider
whether
he
would
not
have
his
horse
saddle
and
go
home
by
the
moonlight
,
and
give
up
care
for
earthly
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
wish
that
he
have
beg
Lydgate
to
come
again
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
deliver
a
different
opinion
,
and
think
that
Raffles
be
get
into
a
less
hopeful
state
.
 
<EOS>
Should
he
send
for
Lydgate
?
 
<EOS>
if
raffle
be
really
get
bad
,
and
slowly
die
,
Bulstrode
feel
that
he
could
go
to
bed
and
sleep
in
gratitude
to
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
he
bad
?
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
may
come
and
simply
say
that
he
be
go
on
as
he
expect
,
and
predict
that
he
would
by
-
and
-
by
fall
into
a
good
sleep
,
and
get
well
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
send
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
shrink
from
that
result
.
 
<EOS>
no
idea
or
opinion
could
hinder
him
from
see
the
one
probability
to
be
,
that
Raffles
recover
would
be
just
the
same
man
as
before
,
with
his
strength
as
a
tormentor
renew
,
oblige
him
to
drag
away
his
wife
to
spend
her
year
apart
from
her
friend
and
native
place
,
carry
an
alienating
suspicion
against
him
in
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
sit
an
hour
and
a
half
in
this
conflict
by
the
firelight
only
,
when
a
sudden
thought
make
him
rise
and
light
the
bed
-
candle
,
which
he
have
bring
down
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
be
,
that
he
have
not
tell
Mrs.
Abel
when
the
dose
of
opium
must
cease
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
hold
of
the
candlestick
,
but
stand
motionless
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
She
may
already
have
give
him
more
than
Lydgate
have
prescribe
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
excusable
in
him
,
that
he
should
forget
part
of
an
order
,
in
his
present
weary
condition
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
-
stair
,
candle
in
hand
,
not
know
whether
he
should
straightway
enter
his
own
room
and
go
to
bed
,
or
turn
to
the
patient
's
room
and
rectify
his
omission
.
 
<EOS>
He
pause
in
the
passage
,
with
his
face
turn
towards
Raffles
's
room
,
and
he
could
hear
him
moan
and
murmuring
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
asleep
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
who
could
know
that
Lydgate
's
prescription
would
not
be
better
disobey
than
follow
,
since
there
be
still
no
sleep
?
  
<EOS>
He
turn
into
his
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
have
quite
undress
,
Mrs.
Abel
rap
at
the
door
;
he
open
it
an
inch
,
so
that
he
could
hear
her
speak
low
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
should
I
have
no
brandy
nor
nothing
to
give
the
poor
creetur
?
 
<EOS>
He
feel
sink
away
,
and
nothing
else
<EOS>
will
he
swaller
 
<EOS>
and
but
little
strength
in
it
,
if
he
do
 
<EOS>
only
the
opium
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
more
and
more
he
be
sink
down
through
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
her
surprise
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
do
not
answer
.
 
<EOS>
a
struggle
be
go
on
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
must
die
for
want
o
'
support
,
if
he
go
on
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
when
I
nurse
my
poor
master
,
Mr.
Robisson
,
I
have
to
give
him
port
-
wine
and
brandy
constant
,
and
a
big
glass
at
a
time
,
"
add
Mrs.
Abel
,
with
a
touch
of
remonstrance
in
her
tone
.
  
<EOS>
but
again
Mr.
Bulstrode
do
not
answer
immediately
,
and
she
continue
,
"
It
be
not
a
time
to
spare
when
people
be
at
death
's
door
,
nor
would
you
wish
it
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
else
I
should
give
him
our
own
bottle
o
'
rum
as
we
keep
by
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
sitter
-
up
so
as
you
have
be
,
and
do
everything
as
lay
in
your
power
 
"
  
<EOS>
here
a
key
be
thrust
through
the
inch
of
doorway
,
and
Mr.
Bulstrode
say
huskily
,
"
that
be
the
key
of
the
wine
-
cooler
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
plenty
of
brandy
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
 
about
six
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
rise
and
spend
some
time
in
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
do
any
one
suppose
that
private
prayer
be
necessarily
candid
 
necessarily
go
to
the
root
of
action
?
 
<EOS>
private
prayer
be
inaudible
speech
,
and
speech
be
representative
:
who
can
represent
himself
just
as
he
be
,
even
in
his
own
reflection
?
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
have
not
yet
unravel
in
his
thought
the
confused
prompting
of
the
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
  
<EOS>
He
listen
in
the
passage
,
and
could
hear
hard
stertorous
breathing
.
<EOS>
then
he
walk
out
in
the
garden
,
and
look
at
the
early
rime
on
the
grass
and
fresh
spring
leave
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
re
-
enter
the
house
,
he
feel
startled
at
the
sight
of
Mrs.
Abel
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
your
patient
 
asleep
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
,
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
go
very
deep
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Abel
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
go
off
gradual
between
three
and
four
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
please
to
go
and
look
at
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
no
harm
to
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
man
be
go
afield
,
and
the
little
girl
's
seeing
to
the
kettle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
go
up
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
glance
he
know
that
Raffles
be
not
in
the
sleep
which
bring
revival
,
but
in
the
sleep
which
stream
deep
and
deep
into
the
gulf
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
round
the
room
and
see
a
bottle
with
some
brandy
in
it
,
and
the
almost
empty
opium
phial
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
the
phial
out
of
sight
,
and
carry
the
brandy
-
bottle
down
-
stair
with
him
,
lock
it
again
in
the
wine
-
cooler
.
  
<EOS>
while
breakfast
he
consider
whether
he
should
ride
to
Middlemarch
at
once
,
or
wait
for
Lydgate
's
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
He
decide
to
wait
,
and
tell
Mrs.
Abel
that
she
may
go
about
her
work
 
<EOS>
he
could
watch
in
the
bed
-
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
sit
there
and
beheld
the
enemy
of
his
peace
go
irrevocably
into
silence
,
he
feel
more
at
rest
than
he
have
do
for
many
month
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
be
soothe
by
the
enfolding
wing
of
secrecy
,
which
seem
just
then
like
an
angel
send
down
for
his
relief
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
out
his
pocket
-
book
to
review
various
memorandum
there
as
to
the
arrangement
he
have
project
and
partly
carry
out
in
the
prospect
of
quit
Middlemarch
,
and
consider
how
far
he
would
let
them
stand
or
recall
them
,
now
that
his
absence
would
be
brief
.
 
<EOS>
some
economy
which
he
feel
desirable
may
still
find
a
suitable
occasion
in
his
temporary
withdrawal
from
management
,
and
he
hope
still
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
take
a
large
share
in
the
expense
of
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
way
the
moment
pass
,
until
a
change
in
the
stertorous
breathing
be
mark
enough
to
draw
his
attention
wholly
to
the
bed
,
and
force
him
to
think
of
the
depart
life
,
which
have
once
be
subservient
to
his
own
 
which
he
have
once
be
glad
to
find
base
enough
for
him
to
act
on
as
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
gladness
then
which
impel
him
now
to
be
glad
that
the
life
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
and
who
could
say
that
the
death
of
Raffles
have
be
hasten
?
 
<EOS>
who
know
what
would
have
save
him
?
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
arrive
at
half
-
past
ten
,
in
time
to
witness
the
final
pause
of
the
breath
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
room
Bulstrode
observe
a
sudden
expression
in
his
face
,
which
be
not
so
much
surprise
as
a
recognition
that
he
have
not
judge
correctly
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
by
the
bed
in
silence
for
some
time
,
with
his
eye
turn
on
the
die
man
,
but
with
that
subdued
activity
of
expression
which
show
that
he
be
carry
on
an
inward
debate
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
this
change
begin
?
"
say
he
,
look
at
Bulstrode
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
watch
by
him
last
night
,
"
say
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
over
-
wear
,
and
leave
him
under
Mrs.
Abel
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
that
he
sink
into
sleep
between
three
and
four
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
in
before
eight
he
be
nearly
in
this
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
ask
another
question
,
but
watch
in
silence
until
he
say
,
"
It
be
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
morning
Lydgate
be
in
a
state
of
recover
hope
and
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
set
out
on
his
work
with
all
his
old
animation
,
and
feel
himself
strong
enough
to
bear
all
the
deficiency
of
his
married
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
conscious
that
Bulstrode
have
be
a
benefactor
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
uneasy
about
this
case
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
expect
it
to
terminate
as
it
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
hardly
know
how
to
put
a
question
on
the
subject
to
Bulstrode
without
appear
to
insult
him
;
and
if
he
examine
the
housekeeper
 
why
,
the
man
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
no
use
in
imply
that
somebody
's
ignorance
or
imprudence
have
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
he
himself
may
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
Bulstrode
ride
back
to
Middlemarch
together
,
talk
of
many
thing
 
chiefly
cholera
and
the
chance
of
the
Reform
Bill
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
the
firm
resolve
of
the
political
Unions
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
about
Raffles
,
except
that
Bulstrode
mention
the
necessity
of
have
a
grave
for
him
in
Lowick
churchyard
,
and
observe
that
,
so
far
as
he
know
,
the
poor
man
have
no
connection
,
except
Rigg
,
whom
he
have
state
to
be
unfriendly
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
on
return
home
Lydgate
have
a
visit
from
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
the
Vicar
have
not
be
in
the
town
the
day
before
,
but
the
news
that
there
be
an
execution
in
Lydgate
's
house
have
get
to
Lowick
by
the
evening
,
have
be
carry
by
Mr.
Spicer
,
shoemaker
and
parish
-
clerk
,
who
have
it
from
his
brother
,
the
respectable
bell
-
hanger
in
Lowick
Gate
.
 
<EOS>
since
that
evening
when
Lydgate
have
come
down
from
the
billiard
room
with
Fred
Vincy
,
Mr.
Farebrother
's
thought
about
him
have
be
rather
gloomy
.
<EOS>
play
at
the
Green
Dragon
once
or
oftener
may
have
be
a
trifle
in
another
man
;
but
in
Lydgate
it
be
one
of
several
sign
that
he
be
get
unlike
his
former
self
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
do
thing
for
which
he
have
formerly
even
an
excessive
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
certain
dissatisfaction
in
marriage
,
which
some
silly
tinkling
of
gossip
have
give
him
hint
of
,
may
have
to
do
with
this
change
,
Mr.
Farebrother
feel
sure
that
it
be
chiefly
connect
with
the
debt
which
be
be
more
and
more
distinctly
report
,
and
he
begin
to
fear
that
any
notion
of
Lydgate
's
have
resource
or
friend
in
the
background
must
be
quite
illusory
.
 
<EOS>
the
rebuff
he
have
meet
with
in
his
first
attempt
to
win
Lydgate
's
confidence
,
disincline
him
to
a
second
;
but
this
news
of
the
execution
be
actually
in
the
house
,
determine
the
Vicar
to
overcome
his
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
have
just
dismiss
a
poor
patient
,
in
whom
he
be
much
interested
,
and
he
come
forward
to
put
out
his
hand
 
with
an
open
cheerfulness
which
surprise
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
Could
this
too
be
a
proud
rejection
of
sympathy
and
help
?
 
<EOS>
never
mind
;
the
sympathy
and
help
should
be
offer
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
,
Lydgate
?
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
see
you
because
I
have
hear
something
which
make
me
anxious
about
you
,
"
say
the
Vicar
,
in
the
tone
of
a
good
brother
,
only
that
there
be
no
reproach
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
seat
by
this
time
,
and
Lydgate
answer
immediately
    
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
hear
that
there
be
an
execution
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
be
it
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
with
an
air
of
freedom
,
as
if
he
do
not
mind
talk
about
the
affair
now
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
danger
be
over
;
the
debt
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
my
difficulty
now
<EOS>
:
I
shall
be
free
from
debt
,
and
able
,
I
hope
,
to
start
afresh
on
a
well
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
thankful
to
hear
it
,
"
say
the
Vicar
,
fall
back
in
his
chair
,
and
speak
with
that
low
-
toned
quickness
which
often
follow
the
removal
of
a
load
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
that
well
than
all
the
news
in
the
"
Times
.
<EOS>
"
I
confess
I
come
to
you
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
for
come
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
enjoy
the
kindness
all
the
more
because
I
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
be
a
good
deal
crush
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
shall
find
the
bruise
still
painful
by
-
and
by
,
"
he
add
,
smile
rather
sadly
;
"
but
just
now
I
can
only
feel
that
the
torture
-
screw
be
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
be
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
say
earnestly
,
"
My
dear
fellow
,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
if
I
take
a
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
you
will
ask
anything
that
ought
to
offend
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
 
this
be
necessary
to
set
my
heart
quite
at
rest
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
 
have
you
?
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
pay
your
debt
,
incur
another
debt
which
may
harass
you
bad
hereafter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
color
slightly
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
reason
why
I
should
not
tell
you
 
since
the
fact
be
so
 
that
the
person
to
whom
I
be
indebted
be
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>

Mr.

His

in

always
urge
Lydgate

avoid
any

Bulstrode

He
add
immediately

"
<EOS>
and
Bulstrode
must
naturally
feel
an
interest
in
your
welfare

after
you
have
work
with
him
in
a
way
which
have
probably
reduce
your

act
accordingly

Lydgate
feel

They
make
more
distinct
within
him
the
uneasy
consciousness
which
have
show
its
first
dim
stirring
only
a
few
hour
before
,
that
Bulstrode
's
motive
for
his
sudden
beneficence
follow
close
upon
the
chill
indifference
may
be
merely
selfish
.
 
<EOS>
He
let
the
kindly
supposition
pass

<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
the
history
of
the
loan

it
be
more
vividly
present
with
him
than
ever

as
well
as
the
fact
which
the
Vicar
delicately
ignore
 
that
this
relation
of
personal
indebtedness
to
Bulstrode
be
what
he
have
once
be
most
resolve
to
avoid

He
begin
,
instead
of

speak
of
his
project
economy

of
his

"
I
shall

I
really

I

He

Mr.

be
a

that
something
worth
listen
to
be
go
on
there
;
and
Mr.
Bambridge
deliver
his
narrative
in
the
hearing
of
seven
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
mainly
what
we
know
,
include
the
fact
about
Will
Ladislaw
,
<EOS>
with
some
local
color
and
circumstance
add
:
it
be
what
Bulstrode
have
dread
the
betrayal
of
 
and
hope
to
have
bury
forever
with
the
corpse
of
Raffles
 
<EOS>
it
be
that
haunt
ghost
of
his
early
life
which
as
he
ride
past
the
archway
of
the
Green
Dragon
he
be
trust
that
Providence
have
deliver
him
from
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
confess
to
himself
yet
that
he
have
do
anything
in
the
way
of
contrivance
to
this
end
;
he
have
accept
what
seem
to
have
be
offer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
prove
that
he
have
do
anything
which
hasten
the
departure
of
that
man
's
soul
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
gossip
about
Bulstrode
spread
through
Middlemarch
like
the
smell
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
Hawley
follow
up
his
information
by
send
a
clerk
whom
he
could
trust
to
Stone
Court
on
a
pretext
of
inquire
about
hay
,
but
really
to
gather
all
that
could
be
learn
about
Raffles
and
his
illness
from
Mrs.
Abel
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
it
come
to
his
knowledge
that
Mr.
Garth
have
carry
the
man
to
Stone
Court
in
his
gig
;
and
Mr.
Hawley
in
consequence
take
an
opportunity
of
see
Caleb
,
call
at
his
office
to
ask
whether
he
have
time
to
undertake
an
arbitration
if
it
be
require
,
and
then
ask
him
incidentally
about
Raffles
.
 
<EOS>
Caleb
be
betray
into
no
word
injurious
to
Bulstrode
beyond
the
fact
which
he
be
force
to
admit
,
that
he
have
give
up
act
for
him
within
the
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hawley
draw
his
inference
,
and
feel
convinced
that
Raffles
have
tell
his
story
to
Garth
,
and
that
Garth
have
give
up
Bulstrode
's
affair
in
consequence
,
say
so
a
few
hour
later
to
Mr.
Toller
.
 
<EOS>
the
statement
be
pass
on
until
it
have
quite
lose
the
stamp
of
an
inference
,
and
be
take
as
information
come
straight
from
Garth
,
so
that
even
a
diligent
historian
may
have
conclude
Caleb
to
be
the
chief
publisher
of
Bulstrode
's
misdemeanor
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hawley
be
not
slow
to
perceive
that
there
be
no
handle
for
the
law
either
in
the
revelation
make
by
Raffles
or
in
the
circumstance
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
himself
ride
to
Lowick
village
that
he
may
look
at
the
register
and
talk
over
the
whole
matter
with
Mr.
Farebrother
,
who
be
not
more
surprised
than
the
lawyer
that
an
ugly
secret
should
have
come
to
light
about
Bulstrode
,
though
he
have
always
have
justice
enough
in
him
to
hinder
his
antipathy
from
turn
into
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
they
be
talk
another
combination
be
silently
go
forward
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
mind
,
which
foreshadow
what
be
soon
to
be
loudly
speak
of
in
Middlemarch
as
a
necessary
"
put
of
two
and
two
together
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
the
reason
which
keep
Bulstrode
in
dread
of
raffle
there
flash
the
thought
that
the
dread
may
have
something
to
do
with
his
munificence
towards
his
medical
man
;
and
though
he
resist
the
suggestion
that
it
have
be
consciously
accept
in
any
way
as
a
bribe
,
he
have
a
foreboding
that
this
complication
of
thing
may
be
of
malignant
effect
on
Lydgate
's
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
He
perceive
that
Mr.
Hawley
know
nothing
at
present
of
the
sudden
relief
from
debt
,
and
he
himself
be
careful
to
glide
away
from
all
approach
towards
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
deep
breath
,
want
to
wind
up
the
illimitable
discussion
of
what
may
have
be
,
though
nothing
could
be
legally
prove
,
"
it
be
a
strange
story
.
 
<EOS>
so
our
mercurial
Ladislaw
have
a
queer
genealogy
!
 
<EOS>
a
high
-
spirited
young
lady
and
a
musical
polish
patriot
make
a
likely
enough
stock
for
him
to
spring
from
,
but
I
should
never
have
suspect
a
grafting
of
the
Jew
pawnbroker
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
know
what
a
mixture
will
turn
out

you

<EOS>
Mr.

Raffles
in
any
other
light
than

piece
of
evidence
on

side

news

able
not
only
to
get
rid
of
the
execution
in
his
house
but
to

be

gather
round
it
conjecture

comment
which
give
it
new
body
and
impetus
,
and
soon
fill
the
ear
of
other
person
besides
Mr.
Hawley
,
who
be
not
slow
to
see
a
significant
relation
between
this
sudden
command
of
money
and
Bulstrode
's
desire
to
stifle
the
scandal
of
Raffles
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
money
come
from
Bulstrode
would
infallibly
have
be
guess
even
if
there
have
be
no
direct
evidence
of
it
;
for
it
have
beforehand
enter
into
the
gossip
about
Lydgate
's
affair
,
that
neither
his
father
-
in

law
nor
his
own
family
would
do
anything
for
him
,
and
direct
evidence
be
furnish
not
only
by
a
clerk
at
the
Bank

but
by
innocent
Mrs.
Bulstrode
herself
,
who
mention
the
loan
to
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
who
mention
it
to
her
daughter
-
in

law
of
the
house
of
Toller
,
who
mention
it
generally
.
 
<EOS>
the
business
be
feel
to
be
so
public
and
important
that
it
require
dinner
to
feed
it
,
and
many
invitation
be
just
then
issue
and
accept
on
the
strength
of
this
scandal
concern
Bulstrode
and
Lydgate
;
wife
,
widow
,
and
single
lady
take
their
work
and
go
out
to
tea
oftener
than
usual
;
and
all
public
conviviality
,
from
the
Green
Dragon
to
Dollop
's
,
gather
a
z
which
could
not
be
win
from
the
question
whether
the
Lords
would
throw
out
the
Reform
Bill
.
  
<EOS>
for
hardly
anybody
doubt
that
some
scandalous
reason
or
other
be
at
the
bottom
of
Bulstrode
's
liberality
to
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Hawley
indeed
,
in
the
first
instance
,
invite
a
select
party
,
include
the
two
physician
,
with
Mr
Toller
and
Mr.
Wrench
,
expressly
to
hold
a
close
discussion
as
to
the
probability
of
Raffles
's
illness
,
recite
to
them
all
the
particular
which
have
be
gather
from
Mrs.
Abel
in
connection
with
Lydgate
's
certificate
,
that
the
death
be
due
to
delirium
tremen
;
and
the
medical
gentleman
,
who
all
stand
undisturbedly
on
the
old
path
in
relation
to
this
disease
,
declare
that
they
could
see
nothing
in
these
particular
which
could
be
transform
into
a
positive
ground
of
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
moral
ground
of
suspicion
remain
:
<EOS>
the
strong
motive
Bulstrode
clearly
have
for
wish
to
be
rid
of
raffle
,
and
the
fact
that
at
this
critical
moment
he
have
give
Lydgate
the
help
which
he
must
for
some
time
have
know
the
need
for
;
the
disposition
,
moreover
,
to
believe
that
Bulstrode
would
be
unscrupulous
,
and
the
absence
of
any
indisposition
to
believe
that
Lydgate
may
be
as
easily
bribe
as
other
haughty
-
minded
man
when
they
have
find
themselves
in
want
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
the
money
have
be
give
merely
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
about
the
scandal
of
Bulstrode
's
early
life
,
the
fact
throw
an
odious
light
on
Lydgate
,
who
have
long
be
sneer
at
as
make
himself
subservient
to
the
banker
for
the
sake
of
work
himself
into
predominance
,
and
discredit
the
eld
member
of
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
in
spite
of
the
negative
as
to
any
direct
sign
of
guilt
in
relation
to
the
death
at
Stone
Court
,
Mr.
Hawley
's
select
party
break
up
with
the
sense
that
the
affair
have
"
an
ugly
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
this
vague
conviction
of
indeterminable
guilt
,
which
be
enough
to
keep
up
much
head
-
shake
and
bite
innuendo
even
among
substantial
professional
senior
,
have
for
the
general
mind
all
the
superior
power
of
mystery
over
fact
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
like
better
to
conjecture
how
the
thing
be
,
than
simply
to
know
it
;
for
conjecture
soon
become
more
confident
than
knowledge
,
and
have
a
more
liberal
allowance
for
the
incompatible
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
more
definite
scandal
concern
Bulstrode
's
early
life
be
,
for
some
mind
,
melt
into
the
mass
of
mystery
,
as
so
much
lively
metal
to
be
pour
out
in
dialogue
,
and
to
take
such
fantastic
shape
as
heaven
please

this
be
the
tone
of
thought
chiefly
sanction
by
Mrs.

the
spirited
landlady
of
the
Tankard
in
Slaughter
Lane
,
who
have
often
to

to

that

as

neither

neither

why

I

I

I

whether
they
be

out
,
and
yet
have
gripe

so
I
will
leave
your
own
sense
to
judge
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
tell
me
!
 
<EOS>
all
I
say
be
,
it
be
a
mercy
they
do
not
take
this
Doctor
Lydgate
on
to
our
club
.

there
be
many

"
  
<EOS>
the
head
of
this
discussion
at
"
Dollop
's
"
have
be
the
common
theme
among
all
class
in
the
town
,
have
be
carry
to
Lowick
Parsonage
on
one
side
and
to
Tipton
Grange
on
the
other
,
have
come
fully
to
the
ear
of
the
Vincy
family
,
and
have
be
discuss
with
sad
reference
to
"
poor
Harriet
"
by
all
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
friend
,
before
Lydgate
know
distinctly
why
people
be
look
strangely
at
him
,
and
before
Bulstrode
himself
suspect
the
betrayal
of
his
secret
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
accustomed
to
very
cordial
relation
with
his
neighbor
,
and
hence
he
could
not
miss
the
sign
of
cordiality
;
moreover
,
he
have
be
take
journey
on
business
of
various
kind
,
have
now
make
up
his
mind
that
he
need
not
quit
Middlemarch
,
and
feel
able
consequently
to
determine
on
matter
which
he
have
before
leave
in
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
make
a
journey
to
Cheltenham
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
,
"
he
have
say
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
great
spiritual
advantage
to
be
have
in
that
town
along
with
the
air
and
the
water
,
and
six
week
there
will
be
eminently
refreshing
to
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
really
believe
in
the
spiritual
advantage
,
and
mean
that
his
life
henceforth
should
be
the
more
devoted
because
of
those
later
sin
which
he
represent
to
himself
as
hypothetic
,
pray
hypothetically
for
their
pardon
:
 
"
if
I
have
herein
transgress
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
hospital
,
he
avoid
say
anything
further
to
Lydgate
,
fear
to
manifest
a
too
sudden
change
of
plan
immediately
on
the
death
of
Raffles
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
secret
soul
he
believe
that
Lydgate
suspect
his
order
to
have
be
intentionally
disobey
,
and
suspect
this
<EOS>
he
must
also
suspect
a
motive
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
have
be
betray
to
him
as
to
the
history
of
Raffles
,
and
Bulstrode
be
anxious
not
to
do
anything
which
would
give
emphasis
to
his
undefined
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
any
certainty
that
a
particular
method
of
treatment
would
either
save
or
kill
,
Lydgate
himself
be
constantly
argue
against
such
dogmatism
;
he
have
no
right
to
speak
,
and
he
have
every
motive
for
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
Bulstrode
feel
himself
providentially
secure
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
incident
he
have
strongly
winced
under
have
be
an
occasional
encounter
with
Caleb
Garth
,
who
,
however
,
have
raise
his
hat
with
mild
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
on
the
part
of
the
principal
townsman
a
strong
determination
be
grow
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
a
meeting
be
to
be
hold
in
the
Town
-
Hall
on
a
sanitary
question
which
have
rise
into
press
importance
by
the
occurrence
of
a
cholera
case
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
since
the
Act
of
Parliament
,
which
have
be
hurriedly
pass
,
authorize
assessment
for
sanitary
measure
,
there
have
be
a
Board
for
the
superintendence
of
such
measure
appoint
in
Middlemarch
,
and
<EOS>
much
cleansing
and
preparation
have
be
concur
in
by
Whigs
and
Tories
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
now
be
,
whether
a
piece
of
ground
outside
the
town
should
be
secure
as
a
burial
-
ground
by
mean
of
assessment
or
by
private
subscription
.
 
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
to
be
open
,
and
almost
everybody
of
importance
in
the
town
be
expect
to
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
a
member
of
the
Board
,
and
just
before
twelve
o'clock
he
start
from
the
Bank
with
the
intention
of
urge
the
plan
of
private
subscription
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
hesitation
of
his
project
,
he
have
for
some
time
keep
himself
in
the
background
,
and
he
feel
that
he
should
this
morning
resume
his
old
position
as
a
man
of
action
and
influence
in
the
public
affair
of
the
town
where
he
expect
to
end
his
day
.
<EOS>
among
the
various
person
go
in
the
same
direction
,
he
see
Lydgate
;
they
join
,
talk
over
the
object
of
the
meeting
,
and
enter
it
together
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
that
everybody
of
mark
have
be
earlier
than
they
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
space
leave
near
the
head
of
the
large
central
table
,
and
they
make
their
way
thither
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
sit
opposite
,
not
far
from
Mr.
Hawley
;
all
the
medical
man
be
there
;
Mr.
Thesiger
be
in
the
chair
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
be
on
his
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
notice
a
peculiar
interchange
of
glance
when
he
and
Bulstrode
take
their
seat
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
business
have
be
fully
open
by
the
chairman
,
who
point
out
the
advantage
of
purchase
by
subscription
a
piece
of
ground
large
enough
to
be
ultimately
use
as
a
general
cemetery
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
whose
rather
high
-
pitch
but
subdued
and
fluent
voice
the
town
be
use
to
at
meeting
of
this
sort
,
rise
and
ask
leave
to
deliver
his
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
could
see
again
the
peculiar
interchange
of
glance
before
Mr.
Hawley
start
up
,
and
say
in
his
firm
resonant
voice
,
"
Mr.
Chairman
,
I
request
that
before
any
one
deliver
his
opinion
on
this
point
I
may
be
permit
to
speak
on
a
question
of
public
feeling
,
which
not
only
by
myself
,
but
by
many
gentleman
present
,
be
regard
as
preliminary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hawley
's
mode
of
speech
,
even
when
public
decorum
repress
his
"
awful
language
,
"
be
formidable
in
its
curtness
and
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thesiger
sanction
the
request
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
sit
down
,
and
Mr.
Hawley
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
I
have
to
say
,
Mr.
Chairman
,
I
be
not
speak
simply
on
my
own
behalf
:
I
be
speak
with
the
concurrence
and
at
the
express
request
of
no
few
than
eight
of
my
fellow
-
townsman
,
who
be
immediately
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
our
united
sentiment
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
should
be
call
upon
 
and
I
do
now
call
upon
him
 
to
resign
public
position
which
he
hold
not
simply
as
a
tax
-
payer
,
but
as
a
gentleman
among
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
practice
and
there
be
act
which
,
owe
to
circumstance
,
the
law
can
not
visit
,
though
they
may
be
bad
than
many
thing
which
be
legally
punishable
.
 
<EOS>
honest
man
and
gentleman
,
if
they
do
not
want
the
company
of
people
who
perpetrate
such
act
,
have
get
to
defend
themselves
as
they
best
can
,
and
that
be
what
I
and
the
friend
whom
I
may
call
my
client
in
this
affair
be
determined
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
be
guilty
of
shameful
act
,
but
I
call
upon
him
either
publicly
to
deny
and
confute
the
scandalous
statement
make
against
him
by
a
man
now
dead
,
and
who
die
in
his
house
 
<EOS>
the
statement
that
he
be
for
many
year
engage
in
nefarious
practice
,
and
that
he
win
his
fortune
by
dishonest
procedure
 
or
else
to
withdraw
from
position
which
could
only
have
be
allow
him
as
a
gentleman
among
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
eye
in
the
room
be
turn
on
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
,
since
the
first
mention
of
his
name
,
have
be
go
through
a
crisis
of
feel
almost
too
violent
for
his
delicate
frame
to
support
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
,
who
himself
be
undergo
a
shock
as
from
the
terrible
practical
interpretation
of
some
faint
augury
,
feel
,
nevertheless
,
that
his
own
movement
of
resentful
hatred
be
check
by
that
instinct
of
the
Healer
which
think
first
of
bring
rescue
or
relief
to
the
sufferer
,
when
he
look
at
the
shrink
misery
of
Bulstrode
's
livid
face
.
  
<EOS>
the
quick
vision
that
his
life
be
after
all
a
failure
,
that
he
be
a
dishonored
man
,
and
must
quail
before
the
glance
of
those
towards
whom
he
have
habitually
assume
the
attitude
of
a
reprover
 
that
God
have
disown
him
before
man
and
leave
him
unscreened
to
the
triumphant
scorn
of
those
who
be
glad
to
have
their
hatred
justify
 
<EOS>
the
sense
of
utter
futility
in
that
equivocation
with
his
conscience
in
deal
with
the
life
of
his
accomplice
,
an
equivocation
which
now
turn
venomously
upon
him
with
the
full
-
grown
fang
of
a
discover
lie
:
 
all
this
rush
through
him
like
the
agony
of
terror
which
fail
to
kill
,
and
leave
the
ear
still
open
to
the
return
wave
of
execration
.
 
<EOS>
the
sudden
sense
of
exposure
after
the
re
-
established
sense
of
safety
come
 
not
to
the
coarse
organization
of
a
criminal
but
to
 
the
susceptible
nerve
of
a
man
whose
intense
be
lie
in
such
mastery
and
predominance
as
the
condition
of
his
life
have
shape
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
that
intense
being
lie
the
strength
of
reaction
.
 
<EOS>
through
all
his
bodily
infirmity
there
run
a
tenacious
nerve
of
ambitious
self
-
preserving
will
,
which
have
continually
leap
out
like
a
flame
,
scatter
all
doctrinal
fear
,
and
which
,
even
while
he
sit
an
object
of
compassion
for
the
merciful
,
be
begin
to
stir
and
glow
under
his
ashy
paleness
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
last
word
be
out
of
Mr.
Hawley
's
mouth
,
Bulstrode
feel
that
he
should
answer
,
and
that
his
answer
would
be
a
retort
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
get
up
and
say
,
"
I
be
not
guilty
,
the
whole
story
be
false
<EOS>
"
 
even
if
he
have
dare
this
,
it
would
have
seem
to
him
,
under
his
present
keen
sense
of
betrayal
,
as
vain
as
to
pull
,
for
cover
to
his
nakedness
,
a
frail
rag
which
would
rend
at
every
little
strain
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
there
be
total
silence
,
while
every
man
in
the
room
be
look
at
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
perfectly
still
,
lean
hard
against
the
back
of
his
chair
;
he
could
not
venture
to
rise
,
and
when
he
begin
to
speak
he
press
his
hand
upon
the
seat
on
each
side
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
voice
be
perfectly
audible
,
though
hoarse
than
usual
,
and
his
word
be
distinctly
pronounce
,
though
he
pause
between
sentence
as
if
short
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
turn
first
toward
Mr.
Thesiger
,
and
then
look
at
Mr.
Hawley
    
<EOS>
"
I
protest
before
you
,
sir

as
a
christian

against
the

become
strict

that
the
evil
-
speaking
of
which
I
be
to

the
victim

here
Bulstrode
's
voice
rise
and
take
on
a
more
biting
accent
,
till
it
seem
a
low
cry

not

<EOS>
after
the
word
chicanery
there
be
a
grow
noise
,
half
of
murmur
and
half
of
hiss
,
while
four
person
start
up
at
once
 
Mr.
Hawley
,
Mr.
Toller

Mr.
chichely

Mr.

as
to
Christian

I
repudiate
your
canting
palaver
Christianity

and
as
to
the
way
in
which
I
spend
my

it
be
not
my
principle
to
maintain
thief

cheat
offspring

I
must
so
far
concur

what
have
fall
from
Mr.

in
expression

to
think
it

for

I
must
say
that
your

be
painfully
inconsistent
with
those

you
have
seek
to
identify
yourself

for

I

<EOS>
Bulstrode
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
take
his
hat
from
the
floor
and
slowly
rise
,
but
he
grasp
the
corner
of
the
chair
so
totteringly
that
Lydgate
feel
sure
there
be
not
strength
enough
in
him
to
walk
away
without
support
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
a
man
sink
close
to
him
for
want
of
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
and
give
his
arm
to
Bulstrode
,
and
in
that
way
lead
him
out
of
the
room
;
yet
this
act
,
which
may
have
be
one
of
gentle
duty
and
pure
compassion
,
be
at
this
moment
unspeakably
bitter
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
he
be
put
his
sign
-
manual
to
that
association
of
himself
with
Bulstrode
,
of
which
he
now
see
the
full
meaning
as
it
must
have
present
itself
to
other
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
feel
the
conviction
that
this
man
who
be
lean
tremblingly
on
his
arm
,
have
give
him
the
thousand
pound
as
a
bribe
,
and
that
somehow
the
treatment
of
raffle
have
be
tamper
with
from
an
evil
motive
.
 
<EOS>
the
inference
be
closely
link
enough
;
the
town
know
of
the
loan
,
believe
it
to
be
a
bribe
,
and
believe
that
he
take
it
as
a
bribe
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lydgate
,
his
mind
struggle
under
the
terrible
clutch
of
this
revelation
,
be
all
the
while
morally
force
to
take
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
the
Bank
,
send
a
man
off
for
his
carriage
,
and
wait
to
accompany
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
business
of
the
meeting
be
despatch
,
and
fringe
off
into
eager
discussion
among
various
group
concern
this
affair
of
Bulstrode
 
and
Lydgate
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
have
before
hear
only
imperfect
hint
of
it
,
and
be
very
uneasy
that
he
have
"
go
a
little
too
far
"
in
countenance
Bulstrode
,
now
get
himself
fully
inform
,
and
feel
some
benevolent
sadness
in
talk
to
Mr.
Farebrother
about
the
ugly
light
in
which
Lydgate
have
come
to
be
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
be
go
to
walk
back
to
Lowick

<EOS>
"
step
into

Mr.

<EOS>
"
I

She

<EOS>
so
they
drive
along
,
Mr.
Brooke
chat
with
good
-
natured
hope
that
there
have
not
really
be
anything
black
in
Lydgate
's
behavior
 
a
young
fellow
whom
he
have
see
to
be
quite
above
the
common
mark
,
when
he
bring
a
letter
from
his
uncle
Sir
Godwin

<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
say
little
:
he
be
deeply
mournful
:
with
a
keen
perception
of
human
weakness
,
he
could
not
be
confident
that
under
the
pressure
of
humiliating
need
Lydgate
have
not
fall
below
himself
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
carriage
drive
up
to
the
gate
of
the

Dorothea
be
out
on
the
gravel

and
come
to

<EOS>
"

Mr.

and
stand
with

bare
under
the

"
I

They
walk
through

towards
the
churchyard

Mr.

want
to
go
on
to
the

and
Dorothea
hear
the
whole
sad

<EOS>
She
listen
with
deep
interest
,
and
beg
to
hear
twice
over
the
fact

impression
concern
Lydgate

<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
pause
at
the
churchyard

and
address
Mr.

,
she
say
energetically
    
<EOS>
"
You

anything
base

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Dorothea
's
impetuous
generosity
,
which
would
have
leap
at
once
to
the
vindication
of
lydgate
from
the
suspicion
of
have
accept
money
as
a
bribe
,
undergo
a
melancholy
check
when
she
come
to
consider
all
the
circumstance
of
the
case
by
the
light
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
delicate
matter
to
touch
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
we
begin
to
inquire
into
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
either
publicly
by
set
the
magistrate

coroner
to
work
,

privately
by
question
lydgate

<EOS>
as
to
the
first
proceeding
there
be
no
solid
ground
to
go
upon
,
else
Hawley
would
have
adopt
it
;
and
as
to
open
the
subject
with
Lydgate
,
I
confess
I
should
shrink
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
probably
take
it
as
a
deadly
insult
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
once
experience
the
difficulty
of
speak
to
him
on
personal
matter
.
 
<EOS>
and
 
one
should
know
the
truth
about
his
conduct
beforehand
,
to
feel
very
confident
of
a
good
result
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
convinced
that
his
conduct
have
not
be
guilty
:
I
believe
that
people
be
almost
always
well
than
their
neighbor
think
they
be
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
her
intense
experience
in
the
last
two
year
have
set
her
mind
strongly
in
opposition
to
any
unfavorable
construction
of
other
;
and
for
the
first
time
she
feel
rather
discontent
with
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
She
dislike
this
cautious
weighing
of
consequence
,
instead
of
an
ardent
faith
in
effort
of
justice
and
mercy
,
which
would
conquer
by
their
emotional
force
.
 
<EOS>
two
day
afterwards
,
he
be
dine
at

the
Chettams

Mr.

be
nod
in

,
she
return
to
the
subject
with
renew
vivacity

<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lydgate
would
understand
that
if
his
friend
hear
a
calumny
about
him
their
first
wish
must
be
to
justify
him

what
do
we
live
for
,
if
it
be
not

make
life
less
difficult
to

I
can
not

indifferent
to
the
trouble
of

"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
tone
and
manner
be
not
more
energetic
than
they
have
be
when
she
be
at
the
head
of
her
uncle
's
table
nearly
three
year
before
,
and
her
experience
since
have
give
her
more
right
to
express
a
decide
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
but
Sir
James
Chettam
be
no
longer
the
diffident
and
acquiescent
suitor
:
he
be
the
anxious
brother
-
in
-
law
,
with
a
devout
admiration
for
his
sister
,
but
with
a
constant
alarm
lest
she
should
fall
under
some
new
illusion
almost
as
bad
as
marry
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
He
smile
much
less
;
when
he
say
"
exactly
"
it
be
more
often
an
introduction
to
a
dissentient
opinion
than
in
those
submissive
bachelor
day
;
and
Dorothea
find
to
her
surprise
that
she
have
to
resolve
not
to
be
afraid
of
him
 
all
the
more
because
he
be
really
her
good
friend
.
<EOS>
He
disagree
with
her
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Dorothea
,
"
he
say
,
remonstrantly
,
"
you
can
not
undertake
to
manage
a
man

life

in
that
way

<EOS>
lydgate
must
know
 
at

he

how
he

clear

he
will

He
must

for

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
his
friend
must
wait
till
they
find
an
opportunity
,
"
add
Mr.
Farebrother
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
possible
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
feel
so
much
weakness
in
myself
that
I
can
conceive
even
a
man
of
honorable
disposition
,
such
as
I
have
always
believe
Lydgate
to
be
,
succumb
to
such
a
temptation
as
that
of
accept
money
which
be
offer
more
or
less
indirectly
as
a
bribe
to
insure
his
silence
about
scandalous
fact
long
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
can
conceive
this
,
if
he
be
under
the
pressure
of
hard
circumstance
 
if
he
have
be
harass
as
I
feel
sure
lydgate
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
believe
anything
bad
of
him
except
under
stringent
proof

<EOS>
but
there
be
the
terrible
nemesis
follow
on
some
error
,
that
it
be
always
possible
for
those
who
like
it
to
interpret
them
into
a
crime
<EOS>
:
there
be
no
proof
in
favor
of
the
man
outside
his
own
consciousness

assertion

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
cruel
!

her

would
you
not

to
be
the
one
person
who
believe
in

innocence

of
the

belie
him

there

seize
with
faintness
at

mile
out

<EOS>
He
feel
himself
become
violent
and
unreasonable
as
if
rage
under
the
pain
of
sting
:
he
be
ready
to
curse
the
day
on
which
he
have
come
to
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
everything
that
bad
happen
to
him
there
seem
a
mere
preparation
for
this
hateful
fatality
,
which
have
come
as
a
blight
on
his
honorable
ambition
,
and
must
make
even
people
who
have
only
vulgar
standard
regard
his
reputation
as
irrevocably
damage
.
 
<EOS>
in
such
moment
a
man
can
hardly
escape
be
unloving
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
think
of
himself
as
the
sufferer
,
and
of
other
as
the
agent
who
have
injure
his
lot
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
mean
everything
to
turn
out
differently
;
and
other
have
thrust
themselves
into
his
life
and
thwart
his
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
His
marriage
seem
an
unmitigated
calamity
;
and
he
be
afraid
of
go
to
Rosamond
before
he
have
vent
himself
in
this
solitary
rage
,
lest
the
mere
sight
of
her
should
exasperate
him

make
him
behave
unwarrantably

<EOS>
there
be
episode
in
most
man
's
life
in
which
their
high
quality
can
only
cast
a
deter
shadow
over
the
object
that
fill
their
inward
vision
<EOS>
:
Lydgate
's
tenderheartedness
be
present
just
then
only
as
a
dread
lest
he
should
offend
against
it
,
not
as
an
emotion
that
sway
him
to
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
only
those
who
know
the
supremacy
of
the
intellectual
life
 
the
life
which
have
a
seed
of
ennoble
thought
and
purpose
within
it
 
can
understand
the
grief
of
one
who
fall
from
that
serene
activity
into
the
absorb
soul
-
waste
struggle
with
worldly
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
live
on
without
vindicate
himself
among
people
who
suspect
him
of
baseness
?
 
<EOS>
how
could
he
go
silently
away
from
Middlemarch
as
if
he
be
retreat
before
a
just
condemnation
?
 
<EOS>
and
yet
how
be
he
to
set
about
vindicate
himself
?
  
<EOS>
for
that
scene
at
the
meeting
,
which
he
have
just
witness
,
although
it
have
tell
him
no
particular
,
have
be
enough
to
make
his
own
situation
thoroughly
clear
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Bulstrode
have
be
in
dread
of
scandalous
disclosure
on
the
part
of
Raffles
.
 
<EOS>
lydgate
could
now
construct
all
the
probability
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
afraid
of
some
betrayal
in
my
hearing
:
all
he
want
be
to
bind
me
to
him
by
a
strong
obligation
:
that
be
why
he
pass
on
a
sudden
from
hardness
to
liberality
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
may
have
tamper
with
the
patient
 
<EOS>
he
may
have
disobey
my
order
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
whether
he
do
or
not
,
the
world
believe
that
he
somehow
or
other
poison
the
man
and
that
I
wink
at
the
crime
,
if
I
do
not
help
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
may
not
be
guilty
of
the
last
offence
;
and
it
be
just
possible
that
the
change
towards
me
may
have
be
a
genuine
relenting
 
the
effect
of
second
thought
such
as
he
allege
.
 
<EOS>
what
we
call
the
"
just
possible
"
be
sometimes
true
and
the
thing
we
find
it
easy
to
believe
be
grossly
false
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
last
dealing
with
this
man
Bulstrode
may
have
keep
his
hand
pure
,
in
spite
of
my
suspicion
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
benumbing
cruelty
in
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
he
renounce
every
other
consideration
than
that
of
justify
himself
 
if
he
meet
shrug
,
cold
glance
,
and
avoidance
as
an
accusation
,
and
make
a
public
statement
of
all
the
fact
as
he
know
them
,
who
would
be
convince
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
play
the
part
of
a
fool
to
offer
his
own
testimony
on
behalf
of
himself
,
and
say
,
"
I
do
not
take
the
money
as
a
bribe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
circumstance
would
always
be
strong
than
his
assertion
.
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
to
come
forward
and
tell
everything
about
himself
must
include
declaration
about
Bulstrode
which
would
darken
the
suspicion
of
other
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
tell
that
he
have
not
know
of
Raffles
's
existence
when
he
first
mention
his
pressing
need
of
money
to
Bulstrode
,
and
that
he
take
the
money
innocently
as
a
result
of
that
communication
,
not
know
that
a
new
motive
for
the
loan
may
have
arise
on
his
be
call
in
to
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
the
suspicion
of
Bulstrode
's
motive
may
be
unjust
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
come
the
question
whether
he
should
have
act
in
precisely
the
same
way
if
he
have
not
take
the
money
?
 
<EOS>
certainly
,
if
raffle
have
continue
alive
and
susceptible
of
further
treatment
when
he
arrive
,
and
he
have
then
imagine
any
disobedience
to
his
order
on
the
part
of
Bulstrode
,
he
would
have
make
a
strict
inquiry
,
and
if
his
conjecture
have
be
verify
he
would
have
throw
up
the
case
,
in
spite
of
his
recent
heavy
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
he
have
not
receive
any
money
 
if
Bulstrode
have
never
revoke
his
cold
recommendation
of
bankruptcy
 
would
he
,
Lydgate
,
have
abstain
from
all
inquiry
even
on
find
the
man
dead
?
 
<EOS>
would
the
shrinking
from
an
insult
to
Bulstrode
 
would
the
dubiousness
of
all
medical
treatment
and
the
argument
that
his
own
treatment
would
pass
for
the
wrong
with
most
member
of
his
profession
 
have
have
just
the
same
force
or
significance
with
him
?
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
uneasy
corner
of
Lydgate
's
consciousness
while
he
be
review
the
fact
and
resist
all
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
independent
,
this
matter
of
a
patient
's
treatment
and
the
distinct
rule
that
he
must
do
or
see
do
that
which
he
believe
best
for
the
life
commit
to
him
,
would
have
be
the
point
on
which
he
would
have
be
the
sturdy
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
have
rest
in
the
consideration
that
disobedience
to
his
order
,
however
it
may
have
arise
,
could
not
be
consider
a
crime
,
that
in
the
dominant
opinion
obedience
to
his
order
be
just
as
likely
to
be
fatal
,
and
that
the
affair
be
simply
one
of
etiquette
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
,
again
and
again
,
in
his
time
of
freedom
,
he
have
denounce
the
perversion
of
pathological
doubt
into
moral
doubt
and
have
say
 
"
the
pure
experiment
in
treatment
may
still
be
conscientious
:
my
business
be
to
take
care
of
life
,
and
to
do
the
good
I
can
think
of
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
science
be
properly
more
scrupulous
than
dogma
.
<EOS>
Dogma
give
a
charter
to
mistake
,
but
the
very
breath
of
science
be
a
contest
with
mistake
,
and
must
keep
the
conscience
alive
.
"
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
scientific
conscience
have
get
into
the
debase
company
of
money
obligation
and
selfish
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
a
medical
man
of
them
all
in
Middlemarch
who
would
question
himself
as
I
do
?
"
say
poor
Lydgate
,
with
a
renew
outburst
of
rebellion
against
the
oppression
of
his
lot
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
they
will
all
feel
warranted
in
make
a
wide
space
between
me
and
them
,
as
if
I
be
a
leper
!
 
<EOS>
My
practice
and
my
reputation
be
utterly
damned
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
that
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
I
could
be
clear
by
valid
evidence
,
it
would
make
little
difference
to
the
blessed
world
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
set
down
as
taint
and
should
be
cheapen
to
them
all
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
already
there
have
be
abundant
sign
which
have
hitherto
puzzle
him
,
that
just
when
he
have
be
pay
off
his
debt
and
get
cheerfully
on
his
foot
,
the
townsman
be
avoid
him
or
look
strangely
at
him
,
and
in
two
instance
it
come
to
his
knowledge
that
patient
of
his
have
call
in
another
practitioner
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
be
too
plain
now
.
<EOS>
the
general
black
-
balling
have
begin
.
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
in
Lydgate
's
energetic
nature
the
sense
of
a
hopeless
misconstruction
easily
turn
into
a
dogged
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
the
scowl
which
occasionally
show
itself
on
his
square
brow
be
not
a
meaningless
accident
.
 
<EOS>
already
when
he
be
re
-
enter
the
town
after
that
ride
take
in
the
first
hour
of
stinging
pain
,
he
be
set
his
mind
on
remain
in
Middlemarch
in
spite
of
the
bad
that
could
be
do
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
retreat
before
calumny
,
as
if
he
submit
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
face
it
to
the
utmost
,
and
no
act
of
his
should
show
that
he
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
It
belong
to
the
generosity
as
well
as
defiant
force
of
his
nature
that
he
resolve
not
to
shrink
from
show
to
the
full
his
sense
of
obligation
to
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
the
association
with
this
man
have
be
fatal
to
him
 
true
that
if
he
have
have
the
thousand
pound
still
in
his
hand
with
all
his
debt
unpaid
he
would
have
return
the
money
to
Bulstrode

and
take
beggary
rather
than
the
rescue
which
have
be
sully
with
the
suspicion

bribe
(
for

<EOS>
remember
,
he
be
one

nevertheless

he

away
from

fellow

mortal
whose

make
a

here

no

so
far
as
to
make

when

Candor

<EOS>
to
be
candid
,
in

phraseology

mean
,
to
use
an

opportunity
of
let
your

know
that
you
do
not
take
a
cheerful
view
of
their

their

their

a
robust
candor
never

then
,
again

there
be
the
love
of

a
wide
phrase

mean
in
this
relation

a
lively
objection
to
see
a

look
happy
than
her
husband
's
character
warrant

or
manifest
too
much
satisfaction
in

the

she
would
have
less
complacency
in

in

strong

<EOS>
with
the
review
of
Mrs.
Bulstrode

her
position
it
be
inevitable
to
associate
Rosamond
,
whose
prospect
be
under

blight
with

Rosamond
be
more

too
,
as

of

good
old
Vincy
family
who
have
always
be
know
in
Middlemarch

be
regard
as
a
victim
to
marriage

an
interloper

the
Vincys
have
their
weakness

then
they
lie

there

Mrs.

be
vindicate

Harriet

She

she
have
get

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
hardly
blame
her
for
that
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sprague
;
"
because
few
of
the
good
people
in
the
town
care
to
associate
with

have
somebody

sit

It

Mr.

they

half
keep
the
Tyke

of
course
it

a
discredit

It

still

in

I

on

again

something

He
would

allege
nervous

be
keep
in

<EOS>
not
daring
to
question
her
husband
,
she
say
to
Lydgate
,
on
the
fifth
day
after

meeting

when
she
have
not
leave
home
except
to
go
to
church

anything
happen

some
little
nervous
shock

evasively

He
feel

not

him

what
bring
it
on

Mrs.

look
directly
at
him

large
dark
eye

"
there
be
often
something
poisonous

Lydgate

strong
man
can
stand
it

it
tell
on
people
in
proportion

the
delicacy

It
be
often
impossible
to
account
for
the
precise
moment
of
an
attack

rather
,
to
say
why
the
strength
give
way
at
a
particular
moment

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bulstrode
be
not
satisfied
with
this
answer

<EOS>
there
remain
in
her
the
belief
that
some
calamity
have
befall
her
husband
,
of
which
she
be
to
be
keep
in
ignorance
;
and
it
be
in
her
nature
strongly
to
object
to
such
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
She
beg
leave
for
her
daughter
to
sit
with
their
father
,
and
drive
into
the
town
to
pay
some
visit
,
conjecture
that
if
anything
be
know
to
have
go
wrong
in
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
affair
,
she
should
see
or
hear
some
sign
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
call
on
Mrs.
Thesiger
,
who
be
not
at
home
,
and
then
drive
to
Mrs.
Hackbutt
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hackbutt
see
her
come
from
an
up
-
stair
window
,
and
remember
her
former
alarm
lest
she
should
meet
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
feel
almost
bind
in
consistency
to
send
word
that
she
be
not
at
home
;
but
against
that
,
there
be
a
sudden
strong
desire
within
her
for
the
excitement
of
an
interview
in
which
she
be
quite
determined
not
to
make
the
slight
allusion
to
what
be
in
her
mind

<EOS>
Hence
Mrs.
Bulstrode
be
show
into
the
drawing

room
,
and
Mrs.
Hackbutt
go
to
her
,
with
more
tightness
of

rubbing
of

usually
observable

precaution
adopt

there
will
be
no
more
case
of
cholera
to
be
bury
in
it
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
awful
visitation
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
always
think
Middlemarch
a
very
healthy
spot
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
be
use
to
it
from
a
child
;
but
I
never
see
the
town
I
should
like
to
live
at
better
,
and
especially
our
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
should
be
glad
that
you
always
should
live
at
Middlemarch
,
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
"
say
Mrs.
Hackbutt
,
with
a
slight
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
still
,
we
must
learn
to
resign
ourselves
,
wherever
our
lot
may
be
cast
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
sure
there
will
always
be
people
in
this
town
who
will
wish
you
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hackbutt
long
to
say
,
"
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
part
from
your
husband
,
"
but
it
seem
clear
to
her
that
the
poor
woman
know
nothing
of
the
thunder
ready
to
bolt
on
her
head
,
and
she
herself
could
do
no
more
than
prepare
her
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bulstrode
feel
suddenly
rather
chill
and
tremble
:
there
be
evidently
something
unusual
behind
this
speech
of
Mrs.
Hackbutt
's
;
but
though
she
have
set
out
with
the
desire
to
be
fully
inform
,
she
find
herself
unable
now
to
pursue
her
brave
purpose
,
and
turn
the
conversation
by
an
inquiry
about
the
young
Hackbutts
<EOS>
,
she
soon
take
her
leave
say
that
she
be
go
to
see
Mrs.
Plymdale
.
 
<EOS>
on
her
way
thither
she
try
to
imagine
that
there
may
have
be
some
unusually
warm
sparring
at
the
meeting
between
Mr.
Bulstrode
and
some
of
his
frequent
opponent
 
perhaps
Mr.
Hackbutt
may
have
be
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
account
for
everything
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
in
conversation
with
Mrs.
Plymdale
that
comfort
explanation
seem
no
longer
tenable
.
 
<EOS>
"
Selina
"
receive
her
with
a
pathetic
affectionateness
and
a
disposition
to
give
edifying
answer
on
the
common
topic
,
which
could
hardly
have
reference
to
an
ordinary
quarrel
of
which
the
most
important
consequence
be
a
perturbation
of
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
health
.
 
<EOS>
Beforehand
Mrs.
Bulstrode
have
think
that
she
would
sooner
question
Mrs.
Plymdale
than
any
one
else
;
but
she
find
to
her
surprise
that
an
old
friend
be
not
always
the
person
whom
it
be
easy
to
make
a
confidant
of
:
there
be
the
barrier
of
remember
communication
under
other
circumstance
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
dislike
of
be
pity
and
inform
by
one
who
have
be
long
will
not
to
allow
her
the
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
for
certain
word
of
mysterious
appropriateness
that
Mrs.
Plymdale
let
fall
about
her
resolution
never
to
turn
her
back
on
her
friend
,
convince
Mrs.
Bulstrode
that
what
have
happen
must
be
some
kind
of
misfortune
,
and
instead
of
be
able
to
say
with
her
native
directness
,
"
what
be
it
that
you
have
in
your
mind
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
find
herself
anxious
to
get
away
before
she
have
hear
anything
more
explicit
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
to
have
an
agitating
certainty
that
the
misfortune
be
something
more
than
the
mere
loss
of
money
,
be
keenly
sensitive
to
the
fact
that
Selina
now
,
just
as
Mrs.
Hackbutt
have
do
before
,
avoid
notice
what
she
say
about
her
husband
,
as
they
would
have
avoid
notice
a
personal
blemish
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
good
-
by
with
nervous
haste
,
and
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
to
Mr.
Vincy
's
warehouse
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
short
drive
her
dread
gather
so
much
force
from
the
sense
of
darkness
,
that
when
she
enter
the
private
counting
-
house
where
her
brother
sit
at
his
desk
,
her
knee
tremble
and
her
usually
florid
face
be
deathly
pale
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
the
same
effect
be
produce
in
him
by
the
sight
of
her
:
he
rise
from
his
seat
to
meet
her
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
with
his
impulsive
rashness
    
<EOS>
"
God
help
you
,
Harriet
!
<EOS>
you
know
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
moment
be
perhaps
bad
than
any
which
come
after
.
 
<EOS>
It
contain
that
concentrated
experience
which
in
great
crisis
of
emotion
reveal
the
bias
of
a
nature
,
and
be
prophetic
of
the
ultimate
act
which
will
end
an
intermediate
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
without
that
memory
of
Raffles
she
may
still
have
think
only
of
monetary
ruin
,
but
now
along
with
her
brother
's
look
and
word
there
dart
into
her
mind
the
idea
of
some
guilt
in
her
husband
 
then
,
under
the
working
of
terror
come
the
image
of
her
husband
expose
to
disgrace
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
after
an
instant
of
scorch
shame
in
which
she
feel
only
the
eye
of
the
world
,
with
one
leap
of
her
heart
she
be
at
his
side
in
mournful
but
unreproache
fellowship
with
shame
and
isolation
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
go
on
within
her
in
a
mere
flash
of
time
 
while
she
sink
into
the
chair
,
and
raise
her
eye
to
her
brother
,
who
stand
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
,
Walter
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
her
everything
,
very
inartificially
,
in
slow
fragment
,
make
her
aware
that
the
scandal
go
much
beyond
proof
,
especially
as
to
the
end
of
raffle
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
will
talk
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
even
if
a
man
have
be
acquit
by
a
jury
,
they
will
talk
,
and
nod
and
wink
 
and
as
far
as
the
world
go
,
a
man
may
often
as
well
be
guilty
as
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
breakdown
blow
,
and
it
damage
Lydgate
as
much
as
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
what
be
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
we
have
never
hear
the
name
of
either
Bulstrode
or
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
better
have
be
a
Vincy
all
your
life
,
and
so
have
Rosamond
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bulstrode
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
bear
up
as
well
as
you
can
,
Harriet
.
 
<EOS>
People
do
not
blame
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
stand
by
you
whatever
you
make
up
your
mind
to
do
,
"
say
the
brother
,
with
rough
but
well
-
mean
affectionateness
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
your
arm
to
the
carriage
,
Walter
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
very
weak
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
when
she
get
home
she
be
oblige
to
say
to
her
daughter
,
"
I
be
not
well
,
my
dear
;
I
must
go
and
lie
down
.
 
<EOS>
attend
to
your
papa
.
 
<EOS>
leave
me
in
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
take
no
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
lock
herself
in
her
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
need
time
to
get
used
to
her
maim
consciousness
,
her
poor
lop
life
,
before
she
could
walk
steadily
to
the
place
allot
her
.
 
<EOS>
a
new
search
light
have
fall
on
her
husband
's
character
,
and
she
could
not
judge
him
leniently
:
the
twenty
year
in
which
she
have
believe
in
him
and
venerate
him
by
virtue
of
his
concealment
come
back
with
particular
that
make
them
seem
an
odious
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
marry
her
with
that
bad
past
life
hide
behind
him
,
and
she
have
no
faith
leave
to
protest
his
innocence
of
the
bad
that
be
impute
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
honest
ostentatious
nature
make
the
sharing
of
a
merit
dishonor
as
bitter
as
it
could
be
to
any
mortal
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
imperfectly
teach
woman
,
whose
phrase
and
habit
be
an
odd
patchwork
,
<EOS>
have
a
loyal
spirit
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
whose
prosperity
she
have
share
through
nearly
half
a
life
,
and
who
have
unvaryingly
cherish
her
 
now
that
punishment
have
befall
him
<EOS>
it
be
not
possible
to
her
in
any
sense
to
forsake
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
forsaking
which
still
sit
at
the
same
board
and
lie
on
the
same
couch
with
the
forsaken
soul
,
wither
it
the
more
by
unloving
proximity
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
,
when
she
lock
her
door
,
that
she
should
unlock
it
ready
to
go
down
to
her
unhappy
husband
and
espouse
his
sorrow
,
and
say
of
his
guilt
,
I
will
mourn
and
not
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
need
time
to
gather
up
her
strength
;
she
need
to
sob
out
her
farewell
to
all
the
gladness
and
pride
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
resolve
to
go
down
,
she
prepare
herself
by
some
little
act
which
may
seem
mere
folly
to
a
hard
onlooker
;
they
be
her
way
of
express
to
all
spectator
visible
or
invisible
that
she
have
begin
a
new
life
in
which
she
embrace
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
off
all
her
ornament
and
put
on
a
plain
black
gown
,
and
instead
of
wear
her
much
-
adorn
cap
and
large
bow
of
hair
,
she
brush
her
hair
down
and
put
on
a
plain
bonnet
-
cap
,
which
make
her
look
suddenly
like
an
early
Methodist
.
  
<EOS>
Bulstrode
,
who
know
that
his
wife
have
be
out
and
have
come
in
say
that
she
be
not
well
,
have
spend
the
time
in
an
agitation
equal
to
hers
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
look
forward
to
her
learn
the
truth
from
other
,
and
have
acquiesce
in
that
probability
,
as
something
easy
to
him
than
any
confession
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
imagine
the
moment
of
her
knowledge
come
,
he
await
the
result
in
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
have
be
oblige
to
consent
to
leave
him
,
and
though
he
have
allow
some
food
to
be
bring
to
him
,
he
have
not
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
perish
slowly
in
unpitied
misery
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
should
never
see
his
wife
's
face
with
affection
in
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
turn
to
God
there
seem
to
be
no
answer
<EOS>
but
the
pressure
of
retribution
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
before
the
door
open
and
his
wife
enter
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
look
up
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
with
his
eye
bend
down
,
and
as
she
go
towards
him
she
think
he
look
small
 
<EOS>
he
seem
so
withered
and
shrink
.
 
<EOS>
a
movement
of
new
compassion
and
old
tenderness
go
through
her
like
a
great
wave
,
and
put
one
hand
on
his
which
rest
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
the
other
on
his
shoulder
,
she
say
,
solemnly
but
kindly
    
"
look
up
,
Nicholas
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
raise
his
eye
with
a
little
start
and
look
at
her
half
amazed
for
a
moment
:
her
pale
face
,
her
changed
,
mourning
dress
,
the
tremble
about
her
mouth
,
all
say
,
"
I
know
;
"
and
her
hand
and
eye
rest
gently
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
burst
out
cry
and
they
cry
together
,
she
sit
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
yet
speak
to
each
other
of
the
shame
which
she
be
bear
with
him
,
or
of
the
act
which
have
bring
it
down
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
confession
be
silent
,
and
her
promise
of
faithfulness
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Open
-
minded
as
she
be
,
she
nevertheless
shrink
from
the
word
which
would
have
express
their
mutual
consciousness
,
as
she
would
have
shrink
from
flake
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
,
"
how
much
be
only
slander
and
false
suspicion
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
do
not
say
,
"
I
be
innocent
.

<EOS>

<EOS>
Rosamond
have
a
gleam
of
return
cheerfulness
when
the
house
be
free
from
the
threatening
figure
,
and
when
all
the
disagreeable
creditor
be
pay

<EOS>
but
she
be
not
joyous
:
her
married
life
have
fulfil
none
of
her
hope
,
and
have
be
quite
spoiled
for
her
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
brief
interval
of
calm
,
Lydgate
,
remember
that
he
have
often
be
stormy
in
his
hour
of
perturbation
,
and
mindful
of
the
pain
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
have
to
bear
,
be
carefully
gentle
towards
her
;
but
he
,
too
,
have
lose
some
of
his
old
spirit
,
and
he
still
feel
it
necessary
to
refer
to
an
economical
change
in
their
way
of
living
as
a
matter
of
course
,
try
to
reconcile
her
to
it
gradually
,
and
repress
his
anger
when
she
answer
by
wish
that
he
would
go
to
live
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
do
not
make
this
answer
,
she
listen
languidly
,
and
wonder
what
she
have
that
be
worth
live
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
hard
and
contemptuous
word
which
have
fall
from
her
husband
in
his
anger
have
deeply
offend
that
vanity
which
he
have
at
first
call
into
active
enjoyment
;
and
what
she
regard
as
his
perverse
way
of
look
at
thing
,
keep
up
a
secret
repulsion
,
which
make
her
receive
all
his
tenderness
as
a
poor
substitute
for
the
happiness
he
have
fail
to
give
her
.

They
be
at
a
disadvantage
with
their
neighbor

there
be
no

any
outlook
towards
Quallingham

there
be
no
outlook
anywhere

in
an
occasional
letter
from
Will
Ladislaw

She
have
feel
sting
and
disappoint
by
Will
's
resolution
to
quit
Middlemarch
,
for
in
spite
of
what
she
know

guess
about
his
admiration
for
Dorothea
,
she
secretly
cherish
the
belief
that
he
have
,
or
would
necessarily
come
to
have
,
much
more
admiration
for
herself
;
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
one
of

live
much
in
the
idea
that

they

would
have
prefer
them

the
preference
have
not

hopeless

Mrs.

but
Will

interest
in
her
date
before
he
know
Mrs.

<EOS>
Rosamond
take
his
way
of
talk
to
herself

which
be
a
mixture
of
playful
fault
-
find
and
hyperbolical
gallantry
,
as
the
disguise
of
a
deep
feeling

and
in

agreeable
titillation

<EOS>
that
Will
exaggerate
his
admiration
for
Mrs.
Casaubon
in
order
to
pique
herself
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
poor
Rosamond
's
brain
have
be
busy
before
Will
's
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
make
,
she
think
,
a
much
more
suitable
husband
for
her
than
she
have
find
in
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
no
notion
could
have
be
false
than
this
,
for
Rosamond
's
discontent
in
her
marriage
be
due
to
the
condition
of
marriage
itself
,
to
its
demand
for
self
-
suppression
and
tolerance
,
and
not
to
the
nature
of
her
husband
;
but
the
easy
conception
of
an
unreal
Better
have
a
sentimental
charm
which
divert
her
ennui
.
 
<EOS>
She
construct
a
little
romance
which
be
to
vary
the
flatness
of
her
life
:
Will
Ladislaw
be
always
to
be
a
bachelor
and
live
near
her
,
always
to
be
at
her
command
,
and
have
an
understand
though
never
fully
express
passion
for
her
,
which
would
be
send
out
lambent
flame
every
now
and
then
in
interesting
scene
.
<EOS>
His
departure
have
be
a
proportionate
disappointment
,
and
have
sadly
increase
her
weariness
of
Middlemarch
;
but
at
first
she
have
the
alternative
dream
of
pleasure
in
store
from
her
intercourse
with
the
family
at
Quallingham
.
 
<EOS>
since
then
the
trouble
of
her
married
life
have
deepen
,
and
the
absence
of
other
relief
encourage
her
regretful
rumination
over
that
thin
romance
which
she
have
once
feed
on
.
 
<EOS>
man
and
woman
make
sad
mistake
about
their
own
symptom
,
take
their
vague
uneasy
longing
,
sometimes
for
genius
,
sometimes
for
religion
,
and
oftener
still
for
a
mighty
love
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
have
write
chatty
letter
,
half
to
her
and
half
to
Lydgate
,
and
she
have
reply
:
their
separation
<EOS>
,
she
feel
,
be
not
likely
to
be
final
,
and
the
change
she
now
most
long
for
be
that
Lydgate
should
go
to
live
in
London
;
everything
would
be
agreeable
in
London
;
and
she
have
set
to
work
with
quiet
determination
to
win
this
result
,
when
there
come
a
sudden
,
delightful
promise
which
inspirit
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
shortly
before
the
memorable
meeting
at
the
town
-
hall
,
and
be
nothing
less
than
a
letter
from
Will
Ladislaw
to
Lydgate
,
which
turn
indeed
chiefly
on
his
new
interest
in
plan
of
colonization
,
but
mention
incidentally
,
that
he
may
find
it
necessary
to
pay
a
visit
to
Middlemarch
within
the
next
few
week
 
a
very
pleasant
necessity
,
he
say
,
almost
as
good
as
holiday
to
a
schoolboy
.
 
<EOS>
He
hope
there
be
his
old
place
on
the
rug
,
and
a
great
deal
of
music
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
quite
uncertain
as
to
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
while
Lydgate
be
read
the
letter
to
Rosamond
,
her
face
look
like
a
reviving
flower
 
it
grow
pretty
and
more
blooming
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
unendurable
now
:
the
debt
be
pay
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
be
come
,
and
Lydgate
would
be
persuade
to
leave
Middlemarch
and
settle
in
London
,
which
be
"
so
different
from
a
provincial
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
a
bright
bit
of
morning
.
 
<EOS>
but
soon
the
sky
become
black
over
poor
rosamond
.
 
<EOS>
the
presence
of
a
new
gloom
in
her
husband
,
about
which
he
be
entirely
reserve
towards
her
 
for
he
dread
to
expose
his
lacerated
feeling
to
her
neutrality
and
misconception
 
soon
receive
a
painfully
strange
explanation
,
alien
to
all
her
previous
notion
of
what
could
affect
her
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
new
gayety
of
her
spirit
,
think
that
Lydgate
have
merely
a
bad
fit
of
moodiness
than
usual
,
cause
him
to
leave
her
remark
unanswere
,
and
evidently
to
keep
out
of
her
way
as
much
as
possible
,
she
choose
,
a
few
day
after
the
meeting
,
and
without
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
,
to
send
out
note
of
invitation
for
a
small
evening
party
,
feel
convinced
that
this
be
a
judicious
step
,
since
people
seem
to
have
be
keep
aloof
from
them
,
and
want
restore
to
the
old
habit
of
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
invitation
have
be
accept
,
she
would
tell
Lydgate
,
and
give
him
a
wise
admonition
as
to
how
a
medical
man
should
behave
to
his
neighbor
;
for
Rosamond
have
the
grave
little
air
possible
about
other
people
's
duty
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
the
invitation
be
decline
,
and
the
last
answer
come
into
Lydgate
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
chichely
's
scratch
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
he
write
to
you
about
?
"
<EOS>
say
Lydgate
,
wonderingly
,
as
he
hand
the
note
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
let
him
see
it
,
and
,
look
at
her
severely
,
he
say
    
"
why
on
earth
have
you
be
send
out
invitation
without
tell
me
,
Rosamond
?
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
,
I
insist
that
you
will
not
invite
any
one
to
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
be
invite
other
,
and
they
have
refuse
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
me
?
"
thunder
lydgate
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
certainly
I
hear
you
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
turn
her
head
aside
with
the
movement
of
a
graceful
long
-
necked
bird
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
toss
his
head
without
any
grace
and
walk
out
of
the
room
,
feel
himself
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
's
thought
be
,
that
he
be
get
more
and
more
unbearable
 
not
that
there
be
any
new
special
reason
for
this
peremptoriness
.
 
<EOS>
His
indisposition
to
tell
her
anything
in
which
he
be
sure
beforehand
that
she
would
not
be
interested
be
grow
into
an
unreflecting
habit
,
and
she
be
in
ignorance
of
everything
connect
with
the
thousand
pound
except
that
the
loan
have
come
from
her
uncle
Bulstrode
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
's
odious
humor
and
their
neighbor
'
apparent
avoidance
of
them
have
an
unaccountable
date
for
her
in
their
relief
from
money
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
invitation
have
be
accept
she
would
have
go
to
invite
her
mamma
and
the
rest
,
whom
she
have
see
nothing
of
for
several
day
;
and
she
now
put
on
her
bonnet
to
go
and
inquire
what
have
become
of
them
all
,
suddenly
feel
as
if
there
be
a
conspiracy
to
leave
her
in
isolation
with
a
husband
dispose
to
offend
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
after
the
dinner
hour
,
and
she
find
her
father
and
mother
seat
together
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
They
greet
her
with
sad
look
,
say
"
well
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
her
father
look
so
downcast
;
and
seat
herself
near
him
<EOS>
she
say
    
"
be
there
anything
the
matter
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
answer
,
but
Mrs.
Vincy
say
,
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
have
you
hear
nothing
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
long
before
it
reach
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
anything
about
Tertius
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
turn
pale
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
trouble
immediately
connect
itself
with
what
have
be
unaccountable
to
her
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
dear
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
to
think
of
your
marrying
into
this
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
debt
be
bad
enough
,
but
this
will
be
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stay
,
stay
,
Lucy
,
"
say
Mr.
Vincy
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
nothing
about
your
uncle
Bulstrode
,
Rosamond
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
papa
,
"
say
the
poor
thing
,
feel
as
if
trouble
be
not
anything
she
have
before
experience
,
but
some
invisible
power
with
an
iron
grasp
that
make
her
soul
faint
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
tell
her
everything
,
say
at
the
end
,
"
It
be
well
for
you
to
know
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Lydgate
must
leave
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
thing
have
go
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
accuse
him
of
any
harm
,
"
say
Mr.
Vincy
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
before
be
dispose
to
find
the
utmost
fault
with
Lydgate
.
  
<EOS>
the
shock
to
Rosamond
be
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
that
no
lot
could
be
so
cruelly
hard
as
her
to
have
marry
a
man
who
have
become
the
centre
of
infamous
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
in
many
case
it
be
inevitable
that
the
shame
be
feel
to
be
the
bad
part
of
crime
;
and
it
would
have
require
a
great
deal
of
disentangle
reflection
,
such
as
have
never
enter
into
Rosamond
's
life
,
for
her
in
these
moment
to
feel
that
her
trouble
be
less
than
if
her
husband
have
be
certainly
know
to
have
do
something
criminal
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
shame
seem
to
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
innocently
marry
this
man
with
the
belief
that
he
and
his
family
be
a
glory
to
her
!
 
<EOS>
She
show
her
usual
reticence
to
her
parent
,
and
only
say
,
that
if
Lydgate
have
do
as
she
wish
he
would
have
leave
Middlemarch
long
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
bear
it
beyond
anything
,
"
say
her
mother
when
she
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
thank
God
!
"
say
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
be
much
break
down
.
  
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
go
home
with
a
sense
of
justified
repugnance
towards
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
he
really
do
 
<EOS>
how
have
he
really
act
?
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
tell
her
everything
?
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
,
and
of
course
she
could
not
speak
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
into
her
mind
once
that
she
would
ask
her
father
to
let
her
go
home
again
;
but
dwell
on
that
prospect
make
it
seem
utter
dreariness
to
her
:
a
married
woman
go
back
to
live
with
her
parent
 
<EOS>
life
seem
to
have
no
meaning
for
her
in
such
a
position
:
she
could
not
contemplate
herself
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
two
day
Lydgate
observe
a
change
in
her
,
and
believe
that
she
have
hear
the
bad
news
.
 
<EOS>
Would
she
speak
to
him
about
it
,
or
would
she
go
on
forever
in
the
silence
which
seem
to
imply
that
she
believe
him
guilty
?
 
<EOS>
We
must
remember
that
he
be
in
a
morbid
state
of
mind
,
in
which
almost
all
contact
be
pain
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
Rosamond
in
this
case
have
equal
reason
to
complain
of
reserve
and
want
of
confidence
on
his
part
;
but
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
he
excuse
himself
;
 
be
he
not
justified
in
shrink
from
the
task
of
tell
her
,
<EOS>
since
now
she
know
the
truth
she
have
no
impulse
to
speak
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
but
a
deeper
-
lie
consciousness
that
he
be
in
fault
make
him
restless
,
and
the
silence
between
them
become
intolerable
to
him
;
it
be
as
if
they
be
both
adrift
on
one
piece
of
wreck
and
look
away
from
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
,
"
I
be
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
have
not
I
give
up
expect
anything
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
marry
care
,
not
help
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
that
evening
he
say
    
<EOS>
"
Rosamond
,
have
you
hear
anything
that
distress
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
answer
,
lay
down
her
work
,
which
she
have
be
carry
on
with
a
languid
semi
-
consciousness
,
most
unlike
her
usual
self
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everything
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
people
think
me
disgrace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
faintly
,
begin
to
sew
again
automatically
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
silence
.
 
<EOS>
lydgate
think
,
"
if
she
have
any
trust
in
me
 
any
notion
of
what
I
be
,
she
ought
to
speak
now
and
say
that
she
do
not
believe
I
have
deserve
disgrace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Rosamond
on
her
side
go
on
move
her
finger
languidly
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
to
be
say
on
the
subject
she
expect
to
come
from
Tertius
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
know
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
innocent
of
any
wrong
,
why
do
he
not
do
something
to
clear
himself
?
  
<EOS>
this
silence
of
her
bring
a
new
rush
of
gall
to
that
bitter
mood
in
which
Lydgate
have
be
say
to
himself
that
nobody
believe
in
him
 
even
Farebrother
have
not
come
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
question
her
with
the
intent
that
their
conversation
should
disperse
the
chill
fog
which
have
gather
between
them
,
but
he
feel
his
resolution
check
by
despair
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
even
this
trouble
,
like
the
rest
<EOS>
,
she
seem
to
regard
as
if
it
be
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
to
her
a
being
apart
,
do
what
she
object
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
from
his
chair
with
an
angry
impulse
,
and
thrust
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
underlying
consciousness
all
the
while
that
he
should
have
to
master
this
anger
,
and
tell
her
everything
,
and
convince
her
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
have
almost
learn
the
lesson
that
he
must
bend
himself
to
her
nature
,
and
that
because
she
come
short
in
her
sympathy
,
he
must
give
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
soon
he
recur
to
his
intention
of
open
himself
:
the
occasion
must
not
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
could
bring
her
to
feel
with
some
solemnity
that
here
be
a
slander
which
must
be
meet
and
not
run
away
from
,
and
that
the
whole
trouble
have
come
out
of
his
desperate
want
of
money
,
it
would
be
a
moment
for
urge
powerfully
on
her
that
they
should
be
one
in
the
resolve
to
do
with
as
little
money
as
possible
,
so
that
they
may
weather
the
bad
time
and
keep
themselves
independent
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
mention
the
definite
measure
which
he
desire
to
take
,
and
win
her
to
a
willing
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bind
to
try
this
 
and
what
else
be
there
for
him
to
do
?
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
long
he
have
be
walk
uneasily
backwards
and
forwards
,
but
Rosamond
feel
that
it
be
long
,
and
wish
that
he
would
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
too
have
begin
to
think
this
an
opportunity
for
urge
on
Tertius
what
he
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
the
truth
about
all
this
misery
,
there
be
one
dread
which
assert
itself
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
at
last
seat
himself
,
not
in
his
usual
chair
,
but
in
one
nearer
to
Rosamond
,
lean
aside
in
it
towards
her
,
and
look
at
her
gravely
before
he
reopen
the
sad
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
conquer
himself
so
far
,
and
be
about
to
speak
with
a
sense
of
solemnity
,
as
on
an
occasion
which
be
not
to
be
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
even
open
his
lip
,
when
Rosamond
,
let
her
hand
fall
,
look
at
him
and
say
    
"
<EOS>
surely
,
Tertius
 
"
  
"
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
surely
now
at
last
you
have
give
up
the
idea
of
stay
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
on
live
here
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
go
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
,
and
every
one
else
,
say
you
have
better
go
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
misery
I
have
to
put
up
with
,
it
will
be
easy
away
from
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
feel
miserably
jar
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
that
critical
outpouring
for
which
he
have
prepare
himself
with
effort
,
here
be
the
old
round
to
be
go
through
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
quick
change
of
countenance
he
rise
and
go
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
if
he
have
be
strong
enough
to
persist
in
his
determination
to
be
the
more
because
she
be
less
,
that
evening
may
have
have
a
well
issue
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
energy
could
have
bear
down
that
check
,
he
may
still
have
work
on
Rosamond
's
vision
and
will
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
be
sure
that
any
nature
,
however
inflexible
or
peculiar
,
will
resist
this
effect
from
a
more
massive
being
than
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
take
by
storm
and
for
the
moment
convert
,
become
part
of
the
soul
which
enwrap
them
in
the
ardor
of
its
movement
.
 
<EOS>
but
poor
Lydgate
have
a
throbbing
pain
within
him
,
and
his
energy
have
fall
short
of
its
task
.
  
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
mutual
understanding
and
resolve
seem
as
far
off
as
ever
;
nay
,
it
seem
block
out
by
the
sense
of
unsuccessful
effort
.
<EOS>
They
live
on
from
day
to
day
with
their
thought
still
apart
,
Lydgate
go
about
what
work
he
have
in
a
mood
of
despair
,
and
<EOS>
Rosamond
feeling
,
with
some
justification
,
that
he
be
behave
cruelly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
to
say
anything
to
Tertius
;
but
when
Will
Ladislaw
come
,
she
be
determined
to
tell
him
everything
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
general
reticence
,
she
need
some
one
who
would
recognize
her
wrong

<EOS>
some
day
later
,
Lydgate
be
ride
to
Lowick
Manor
,
in
consequence
of
a
summon
from
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
the
summon
have
not
be
unexpected
,
since
it
have
follow
a
letter
from
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
which
he
state
that
he
have
resume
his
arrangement
for
quit
Middlemarch
,
and
must
remind
Lydgate
of
his
previous
communication
about
the
Hospital
,
to
the
purport
of
which
he
still
adhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
his
duty
,
before
take
further
step
,
to
reopen
the
subject
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
who
now
wish
,
as
before
,
to
discuss
the
question
with
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
view
may
possibly
have
undergo
some
change
,
"
write
Mr.
Bulstrode
;
"
but
,
in
that
case
also
,
it
be
desirable
that
you
should
lay
them
before
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
await
his
arrival
with
eager
interest
.
 
<EOS>
though
,
in
deference
to
her
masculine
adviser
,
she
have
refrain
from
what
Sir
James
have
call
"
interfere
in
this
Bulstrode
business
,
"
the
hardship
of
Lydgate
's
position
be
continually
in
her
mind
,
and
when
Bulstrode
apply
to
her
again
about
the
hospital
,
she
feel
that
the
opportunity
be
come
to
her
which
she
have
be
hinder
from
hasten
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
luxurious
home
,
wander
under
the
bough
of
her
own
great
tree
,
her
thought
be
go
out
over
the
lot
of
other
,
and
her
emotion
be
imprison
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
some
active
good
within
her
reach
,
"
haunt
her
like
a
passion
,
"
and
another
's
need
have
once
come
to
her
as
a
distinct
image
,
preoccupy
her
desire
with
the
yearning
to
give
relief
,
and
make
her
own
ease
tasteless
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
confident
hope
about
this
interview
with
Lydgate
,
never
heed
what
be
say
of
his
personal
reserve
;
never
heed
that
she
be
a
very
young
woman
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
have
seem
more
irrelevant
to
Dorothea
than
insistence
on
her
youth
and
sex
when
she
be
move
to
show
her
human
fellowship
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
sit
wait
in
the
library
,
she
could
do
nothing
but
live
through
again
all
the
past
scene
which
have
bring
Lydgate
into
her
memory
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
owe
their
significance
to
her
marriage
and
its
trouble
 
<EOS>
but
no
<EOS>
;
there
be
two
occasion
in
which
the
image
of
Lydgate
have
come
painfully
in
connection
with
his
wife
and
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
the
pain
have
be
allay
for
Dorothea
,
but
it
have
leave
in
her
an
awakened
conjecture
as
to
what
Lydgate
's
marriage
may
be
to
him
,
a
susceptibility
to
the
slight
hint
about
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
these
thought
be
like
a
drama
to
her
,
and
make
her
eye
bright
,
and
give
an
attitude
of
suspense
to
her
whole
frame
,
though
she
be
only
look
out
from
the
brown
library
on
to
the
turf
and
the
bright
green
bud
which
stand
in
relief
against
the
dark
evergreen
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lydgate
come
in
,
she
be
almost
shock
at
the
change
in
his
face
,
which
be
strikingly
perceptible
to
her
who
have
not
see
him
for
two
month
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
change
of
emaciation
,
but
that
effect
which
even
young
face
will
very
soon
show
from
the
persistent
presence
of
resentment
and
despondency
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cordial
look
,
when
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
soften
his
expression
,
but
only
with
melancholy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
wish
very
much
to
see
you
for
a
long
while
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
"
say
Dorothea
when
they
be
seat
opposite
each
other
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
put
off
ask
you
to
come
until
Mr.
Bulstrode
apply
to
me
again
about
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
advantage
of
keep
the
management
of
it
separate
from
that
of
the
Infirmary
depend
on
you
,
or
,
at
least
,
on
the
good
which
you
be
encourage
to
hope
for
from
have
it
under
your
control
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
you
will
not
refuse
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
decide
whether
you
should
give
a
generous
support
to
the
Hospital
,
"
say
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conscientiously
advise
you
to
do
it
in
dependence
on
any
activity
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
oblige
to
leave
the
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
curtly
,
feel
the
ache
of
despair
as
to
his
be
able
to
carry
out
any
purpose
that
Rosamond
have
set
her
mind
against
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
because
there
be
no
one
to
believe
in
you
?
"
say
Dorothea
,
pour
out
her
word
in
clearness
from
a
full
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
unhappy
mistake
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
them
from
the
first
moment
to
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
do
anything
vile
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
do
anything
dishonorable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
assurance
of
belief
in
him
that
have
fall
on
Lydgate
's
ear
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
a
deep
breath
,
and
say
,
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
could
say
no
more
:
it
be
something
very
new
and
strange
in
his
life
that
these
few
word
of
trust
from
a
woman
should
be
so
much
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
to
tell
me
how
everything
be
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
fearlessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
that
the
truth
would
clear
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
start
up
from
his
chair
and
go
towards
the
window
,
forget
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
so
often
go
over
in
his
mind
the
possibility
of
explain
everything
without
aggravate
appearance
that
would
tell
,
perhaps
unfairly
,
against
Bulstrode
,
and
have
so
often
decide
against
it
 
<EOS>
he
have
so
often
say
to
himself
that
his
assertion
would
not
change
people
's
impression
 
that
Dorothea
's
word
sound
like
a
temptation
to
do
something
which
in
his
soberness
he
have
pronounce
to
be
unreasonable
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
pray
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
with
simple
earnestness
;
"
then
we
can
consult
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wicked
to
let
people
think
evil
of
any
one
falsely
,
when
it
can
be
hinder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
turn
,
remember
where
he
be
,
and
see
Dorothea
's
face
look
up
at
him
with
a
sweet
trustful
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
the
presence
of
a
noble
nature
,
generous
in
its
wish
,
ardent
in
its
charity
,
change
the
light
for
us
:
we
begin
to
see
thing
again
in
their
large
,
quieter
masse
,
and
to
believe
that
we
too
can
be
see
and
judge
in
the
wholeness
of
our
character
.
 
<EOS>
that
influence
be
begin
to
act
on
Lydgate
,
who
have
for
many
day
be
see
all
life
as
one
who
be
drag
and
struggle
amid
the
throng
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
again
,
and
feel
that
he
be
recover
his
old
self
in
the
consciousness
that
he
be
with
one
who
believe
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
bear
hard
on
Bulstrode
,
who
have
lend
me
money
of
which
I
be
in
need
 
though
I
would
rather
have
go
without
it
now

He
be
hunt
down
and
miserable
,
and
have
only
a
poor
thread
of
life
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
to
tell
you
everything
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
speak
where
belief
have
go
beforehand
,
and
where
I
shall
not
seem
to
be
offer
assertion
of
my
own
honesty

<EOS>
You
will
feel
what
be
fair
to
another

as
you
feel
what
be
fair
to
me

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
trust
me
,
"
say
Dorothea
;
"
I
will
not
repeat
anything
without
your
leave
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
the
very
least
,
I
could
say
that
you
have
make
all
the
circumstance
clear
to
me
,
and
that
I
know
you
be
not
in
any
way
guilty

<EOS>
Mr.
Farebrother
would
believe
me
,
and
my
uncle
,
and
Sir
James
Chettam
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
there
be
person
in
Middlemarch
to
whom
I
could
go
;
although
they
do
not
know
much
of
me
,
they
would
believe
me

<EOS>
They
would
know
that
I
could
have
no
other
motive
than
truth
and
justice
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
take
any
pain
to
clear
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
well
that
I
can
do
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
voice
,
as
she
make
this
childlike
picture
of
what
she
would
do
,
may
have
be
almost
take
as
a
proof
that
she
could
do
it
effectively
.
 
<EOS>
the
search
tenderness
of
her
woman
's
tone
seem
make
for
a
defence
against
ready
accuser
.
 
<EOS>
Lydgate
do
not
stay
to
think
that
she
be
quixotic
:
he
give
himself
up
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
to
the
exquisite
sense
of
lean
entirely
on
a
generous
sympathy
,
without
any
check
of
proud
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
tell
her
everything
,
from
the
time
when
,
under
the
pressure
of
his
difficulty
,
he
unwillingly
make
his
first
application
to
Bulstrode
;
gradually
,
in
the
relief
of
speak
,
get
into
a
more
thorough
utterance
of
what
have
go
on
in
his
mind
 
enter
fully
into
the
fact
that
his
treatment
of
the
patient
be
oppose
to
the
dominant
practice
,
into
his
doubt
at
the
last
,
his
ideal
of
medical
duty
,
and
his
uneasy
consciousness
that
the
acceptance
of
the
money
have
make
some
difference
in
his
private
inclination
and
professional
behavior
,
though
not
in
his
fulfilment
of
any
publicly
recognize
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
come
to
my
knowledge
since
,
"
he
add
,
"
that
Hawley
send
some
one
to
examine
the
housekeeper
at
Stone
Court
,
and
she
say
that
she
give
the
patient
all
the
opium
in
the
phial
I
leave
,
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
would
not
have
be
oppose
to
ordinary
prescription
,
even
of
first
-
rate
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
suspicion
against
me
have
no
hold
there
:
they
be
ground
on
the
knowledge
that
I
take
money
,
that
Bulstrode
have
strong
motive
for
wish
the
man
to
die
,
and
that
he
give
me
the
money
as
a
bribe
to
concur
in
some
malpractice
or
other
against
the
patient
 
that
in
any
case
I
accept
a
bribe
to
hold
my
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
just
the
suspicion
that
cling
the
most
obstinately
,
because
they
lie
in
people
's
inclination
and
can
never
be
disprove
.
<EOS>
how
my
order
come
to
be
disobey
be
a
question
to
which
I
do
not
know
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
still
possible
that
Bulstrode
be
innocent
of
any
criminal
intention
 
even
possible
that
he
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
disobedience
,
and
merely
abstain
from
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
belief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
case
on
which
a
man
be
condemn
on
the
ground
of
his
character
 
<EOS>
it
be
believe
that
he
have
commit
a
crime
in
some
undefined
way
,
because
he
have
the
motive
for
do
it
;
and
Bulstrode
's
character
have
envelop
me
,
because
I
take
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
simply
blight
 
like
a
damage
ear
of
corn
 
<EOS>
the
business
be
do
and
can
not
be
undo
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
hard
!
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
the
difficulty
there
be
in
your
vindicate
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
all
this
should
have
come
to
you
who
have
mean
to
lead
a
high
life
than
the
common
,
and
to
find
out
well
way
 
I
can
not
bear
to
rest
in
this
as
unchangeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
mean
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
what
you
say
to
me
when
you
first
speak
to
me
about
the
hospital
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
sorrow
I
have
think
more
about
than
that
 
to
love
what
be
great
,
and
try
to
reach
it
,
and
yet
to
fail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
feel
that
here
he
have
find
room
for
the
full
meaning
of
his
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
everything
to
be
different
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
more
strength
and
mastery
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
most
terrible
obstacle
be
such
as
nobody
can
see
except
oneself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
meditatively
<EOS>
,
 
"
suppose
we
keep
on
the
Hospital
accord
to
the
present
plan
,
and
you
stay
here
though
only
with
the
friendship
and
support
of
a
few
,
the
evil
feeling
towards
you
would
gradually
die
out
;
there
would
come
opportunity
in
which
people
would
be
force
to
acknowledge
that
they
have
be
unjust
to
you
,
because
they
would
see
that
your
purpose
be
pure
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
still
win
a
great
fame
like
the
Louis
and
Laennec
<EOS>
I
have
hear
you
speak
of
,
and
we
shall
all
be
proud
of
you
,

she
end
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
may
do
if
I
have
my
old
trust
in
myself
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
gall
me
more
than
the
notion
of
turn
round
and
run
away
before
this
slander
,
leave
it
unchecked
behind
me
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
can
not
ask
any
one
to
put
a
great
deal
of
money
into
a
plan
which
depend
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
quite
worth
my
while
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
simply
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
uncomfortable
with
my
money
,
because
they
tell
me
I
have
too
little
for
any
great
scheme
of
the
sort
I
like
good
,
and
yet
I
have
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seven
hundred
a
-
year
of
my
own
fortune
,
and
nineteen
hundred
a
-
year
that
Mr.
Casaubon
leave
me
,
and
between
three
and
four
thousand
of
ready
money
in
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
raise
money
and
pay
it
off
gradually
out
of
my
income
which
I
do
not
want
,
to
buy
land
with
and
find
a
village
which
should
be
a
school
of
industry
;
but
Sir
James
and
my
uncle
have
convince
me
that
the
risk
would
be
too
great
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
see
that
what
I
should
most
rejoice
at
would
be
to
have
something
good
to
do
with
my
money
:
I
should
like
it
to
make
other
people
's
life
well
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
very
uneasy
 
come
all
to
me
who
do
not
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
smile
break
through
the
gloom
of
Lydgate
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
childlike
grave
-
eyed
earnestness
with
which
Dorothea
say
all
this
be
irresistible
 
blent
into
an
adorable
whole
with
her
ready
understanding
of
high
experience

<EOS>
(
of
low
experience
such
as
play
a
great
part
in

world

Mrs.

a
very
blurred
shortsighted
knowledge

little

imagination

she
take
the
smile
as
encouragement
of
her
plan

"
I

you
see
now
that
you

scrupulously

she

,
in
a
tone
of
persuasion

<EOS>
"
the
hospital
would
be
one
good
;

make
your
life
quite
whole

well
again
would

another

have
the
goodness
as

He

a
little
while

look
vaguely
towards

window

in
silent
expectation

turn
towards

impetuously

on
immediately

the

with
keen
memory
of

have
set
her
mind
against

trouble

break
off
again

lest

too
much

when

see
the
good
that
may
come
of
stay

Dorothea
,
remonstrantly
,
look
at
Lydgate
as
if
he
have
forget
the
reason
which
have
just
be
consider
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
immediately

<EOS>
"
She
would
not

it

he
say
at

curtly

at
first
that
this
statement
must
do
without
explanation

"

,
indeed
,
I
have
lose
all
spirit
about
carry
on
my
life
here

<EOS>
He
pause
a
moment
and
then
,
follow
the
impulse
to
let
Dorothea
see
deeper
into
the
difficulty
of
his
life
,
he
say
,
"
the
fact
be
,
this
trouble
have
come
upon
her
confusedly

We
have
not

speak
to
each
other
about
it

I
be
not

what
be
in

mind
about
it
:
she
may
fear
that
I
have
really
do
something
base

be
my
fault

suffer
cruelly

May
I
go
and
see
her

Dorothea

eagerly
.

Would
she
accept
my
sympathy
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
tell
her
that
you
have
not

blamable
before
any
one
's
judgment

your
own

cheer

you
ask

Lydgate
,
seize
the
proposition

some
hope

She
would
feel
honored
 
cheer

think
,
by
the
proof
that
you
at

have
some
respect
for
me

I
will
not

about
your
coming

it

at
all

very
well

leave
anything

"
  
<EOS>
He
break
off
,
and
there
be
a
moment
's
silence

Dorothea
refrain
from

what
be
in
her
mind
 
<EOS>
how
well
she
know
that
there
may
be
invisible
barrier
to
speech
between
husband
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
point
on
which
even
sympathy
may
make
a
wound

<EOS>
She
return
to
the
more
outward
aspect
of
Lydgate
's
position
,
say
cheerfully
    
"
<EOS>
and
if
Mrs.
Lydgate
know
that
there
be
friend
who
would
believe
in
you
and
support
you
,
she
may
then
be
glad
that
you
should
stay
in
your
place
and
recover
your
hope
 
and
do
what
you
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
perhaps
then
you
would
see
that
it
be
right
to
agree
with
what
I
propose
about
your
continuing
at
the
Hospital
.
 
<EOS>
surely
you
would
,
if
you
still
have
faith
in
it
as
a
means
of
make
your
knowledge
useful

Lydgate
do
not

she
see
that

be
debate
with
himself

<EOS>
"
You
need
not
decide
immediately
,

she
say
,
gently
.

"
a
few
day
hence
it
will
be
early
enough
for
me
to
send
my
answer
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
still
wait
,
but
at
last
turn
to
speak
in
his
most
decisive
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
prefer
that
there
should

no
interval

for
wavering

sure
enough
of
myself

of
what
it

be
possible
for
me
to
do
under
the
change
circumstance
of
my
life

<EOS>
It
would
be
dishonorable
to
let
other
engage
themselves
to
anything
serious
in
dependence
on
me

<EOS>
I
may
be
oblige
to
go
away
after
all

see
little
chance

anything
else

the
whole
thing
be
too
problematic

can
not
consent

waste

no
 
let
the
new
Hospital
be
join
with
the
old
Infirmary

everything
go
on
as
it
may
have
do
if
I
have
never
come

I
have
keep
a
valuable
register
since
I
have
be
there

shall
send
it
to
a
man

will
make
use

it

end
bitterly

can
think
of
nothing
for
a
long
while

get
an
income

It
hurt
me
very
much
to
hear
you
speak
so
hopelessly

Dorothea

It
would
be
a
happiness

great
thing

as

make
his

energetic

away

look
for

push
myself
;
set
up
in

place

go
to
some
southern
town
where
there
be
plenty
of
idle
English

get
myself
puff
,
 
that

creep
into

no

<EOS>
I
remember
how
pretty
she
be
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
into
whose
mind
every
impression
about
Rosamond
have
cut
deep
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
Lydgate
ride
away
,
he
think
,
"
this
young
creature
have
a
heart
large
enough
for
the
Virgin
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
evidently
think
nothing
of
her
own
future
,
and
would
pledge
away
half
her
income
at
once
,
as
if
she
want
nothing
for
herself
but
a
chair
to
sit
in
from
which
she
can
look
down
with
those
clear
eye
at
the
poor
mortal
who
pray
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
have
what
I
never
see
in
any
woman
before
 
a
fountain
of
friendship
towards
man
 
<EOS>
a
man
can
make
a
friend
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Casaubon
must
have
raise
some
heroic
hallucination
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
could
have
any
other
sort
of
passion
for
a
man
?
 
<EOS>
Ladislaw
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
an
unusual
feeling
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
Casaubon
must
have
have
a
notion
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
 
her
love
may
help
a
man
more
than
her
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
on
her
side
have
immediately
form
a
plan
of
relieve
Lydgate
from
his
obligation
to
Bulstrode
,
which
she
feel
sure
be
a
part
,
though
small
,
of
the
gall
pressure
he
have
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
down
at
once
under
the
inspiration
of
their
interview
,
and
write
a
brief
note
,
in
which
she
plead
that
she
have
more
claim
than
Mr.
Bulstrode
have
to
the
satisfaction
of
provide
the
money
which
have
be
serviceable
to
Lydgate
 
that
it
would
be
unkind
in
Lydgate
not
to
grant
her
the
position
of
be
his
helper
in
this
small
matter
,
the
favor
be
entirely
to
her
who
have
so
little
that
be
plainly
mark
out
for
her
to
do
with
her
superfluous
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
call
her
a
creditor
or
by
any
other
name
if
it
do
but
imply
that
he
grant
her
request
.
 
<EOS>
She
enclose
a
check
for
a
thousand
pound
,
and
determine
to
take
the
letter
with
her
the
next
day
when
she
go
to
see
Rosamond
.
        
<EOS>
"
and
thus
thy
fall
hath
leave
a
kind
of
blot
,
     
to
mark
the
full
-
fraught
man
and
best
indue
     
with
some
suspicion

<EOS>
Henry
V.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
Lydgate
have
to
go
to
Brassing
,
and
tell
Rosamond
that
he
should
be
away
until
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
of
late
she
have
never
go
beyond
her
own
house
and
garden
,
except
to
church
,
and
once
to
see
her
papa
,
to
whom
she
say
,
"
if
Tertius
go
away
,
you
will
help
us
to
move
,
will
you
not
,
papa
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
have
very
little
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
hope
some
one
will
help
us
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Vincy
have
say
,
"
yes
,
child
,
I
do
not
mind
a
hundred
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
the
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
these
exception
she
have
sit
at
home
in
languid
melancholy
and
suspense
,
fix
her
mind
on
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
's
come
as
the
one
point
of
hope
and
interest
,
and
associate
this
with
some
new
urgency
on
Lydgate
to
make
immediate
arrangement
for
leave
Middlemarch
and
go
to
London
,
till
she
feel
assured
that
the
come
would
be
a
potent
cause
of
the
go
,
without
at
all
see
how
.
 
<EOS>
this
way
of
establish
sequence
be
too
common
to
be
fairly
regard
as
a
peculiar
folly
in
Rosamond
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
precisely
this
sort
of
sequence
which
cause
the
great
shock
when
it
be
sunder
:
for
to
see
how
an
effect
may
be
produce
be
often
to
see
possible
missing
and
check
;
but
to
see
nothing
except
the
desirable
cause
,
and
close
upon
it
the
desirable
effect
,
rid
us
of
doubt
and
make
our
mind
strongly
intuitive
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
process
go
on
in
poor
Rosamond
,
while
she
arrange
all
object
around
her
with
the
same
nicety
as
ever
,
only
with
more
slowness
 
or
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
mean
to
play
,
and
then
desist
,
yet
linger
on
the
music
stool
with
her
white
finger
<EOS>
suspend
on
the
wooden
front
,
and
look
before
her
in
dreamy
ennui
.
 
<EOS>
Her
melancholy
have
become
so
marked
that
Lydgate
feel
a
strange
timidity
before
it
,
as
a
perpetual
silent
reproach
,
and
the
strong
man
,
master
by
his
keen
sensibility
towards
this
fair
fragile
creature
whose
life
he
seem
somehow
to
have
bruise
,
shrink
from
her
look
,
and
sometimes
start
at
her
approach
,
fear
of
her
and
fear
for
her
rushing
in
only
the
more
forcibly
after
it
have
be
momentarily
expel
by
exasperation
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
morning
Rosamond
descend
from
her
room
upstairs
 
where
she
sometimes
sit
the
whole
day
when
Lydgate
be
out
 
equip
for
a
walk
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
letter
to
post
 
a
letter
address
to
Mr.
Ladislaw
and
write
with
charming
discretion
,
but
intend
to
hasten
his
arrival
by
a
hint
of
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
-
maid
,
their
sole
house
-
servant
now
,
notice
her
come
down
-
stair
in
her
walking
dress
,
and
think
"
there
never
do
anybody
look
so
pretty
in
a
bonnet
poor
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Dorothea
's
mind
be
fill
with
her
project
of
go
to
Rosamond
,
and
with
the
many
thought
,
both
of
the
past
and
the
probable
future
,
which
gather
round
the
idea
of
that
visit
.
 
<EOS>
until
yesterday
when
Lydgate
have
open
to
her
a
glimpse
of
some
trouble
in
his
married
life
,
the
image
of
Mrs.
Lydgate
have
always
be
associate
for
her
with
that
of
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
her
most
uneasy
moment
 
even
when
she
have
be
agitate
by
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
painfully
graphic
report
of
gossip
 
her
effort
,
nay
,
her
strong
impulsive
prompting
,
have
be
towards
the
vindication
of
Will
from
any
sullying
surmise
;
and
when
,
in
her
meeting
with
him
afterwards
,
she
have
at
first
interpret
his
word
as
a
probable
allusion
to
a
feeling
towards
Mrs.
Lydgate
which
he
be
determined
to
cut
himself
off
from
indulging
,
she
have
have
a
quick
,
sad
,
excuse
vision
of
the
charm
there
may
be
in
his
constant
opportunity
of
companionship
with
that
fair
creature
,
who
most
likely
share
his
other
taste
as
she
evidently
do
his
delight
in
music
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
have
follow
his
parting
word
 
<EOS>
the
few
passionate
word
in
which
he
have
imply
that
she
herself
be
the
object
of
whom
his
love
hold
him
in
dread
,
that
it
be
his
love
for
her
only
which
he
be
resolve
not
to
declare
but
to
carry
away
into
banishment
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
time
of
that
parting
,
Dorothea
,
believe
in
Will
's
love
for
her
,
believe
with
a
proud
delight
in
his
delicate
sense
of
honor
and
his
determination
that
no
one
should
impeach
him
justly
,
feel
her
heart
quite
at
rest
as
to
the
regard
he
may
have
for
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sure
that
the
regard
be
blameless
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nature
in
which
,
if
they
love
us
,
we
be
conscious
of
have
a
sort
of
baptism
and
consecration
:
they
bind
us
over
to
rectitude
and
purity
by
their
pure
belief
about
us
;
and
our
sin
become
that
bad
kind
of
sacrilege
which
tear
down
the
invisible
altar
of
trust
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
not
good
,
none
be
good
"
 
<EOS>
those
little
word
may
give
a
terrific
meaning
to
responsibility
,
may
hold
a
vitriolic
intensity
for
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
nature
be
of
that
kind
:
her
own
passionate
fault
lie
along
the
easily
count
open
channel
of
her
ardent
character
;
and
while
she
be
full
of
pity
for
the
visible
mistake
of
other
,
she
have
not
yet
any
material
within
her
experience
for
subtle
construction
and
suspicion
of
hide
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
simplicity
of
her
,
hold
up
an
ideal
for
other
in
her
believe
conception
of
them
,
be
one
of
the
great
power
of
her
womanhood
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
have
from
the
first
act
strongly
on
Will
Ladislaw
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
,
when
he
part
from
her
,
that
the
brief
word
by
which
he
have
try
to
convey
to
her
his
feeling
about
herself
and
the
division
which
her
fortune
make
between
them
,
would
only
profit
by
their
brevity
when
Dorothea
have
to
interpret
them
:
he
feel
that
in
her
mind
he
have
find
his
high
estimate
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
be
right
there
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
month
since
their
part
Dorothea
have
feel
a
delicious
though
sad
repose
in
their
relation
to
each
other
,
as
one
which
be
inwardly
whole
and
without
blemish
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
an
active
force
of
antagonism
within
her
,
when
the
antagonism
turn
on
the
defence
either
of
plan
or
person
that
she
believe
in
;
and
the
wrong
which
she
feel
that
Will
have
receive
from
her
husband
,
and
the
external
condition
which
to
other
be
ground
for
slight
him
,
only
give
the
more
tenacity
to
her
affection
and
admire
judgment
.
<EOS>
and
now
with
the
disclosure
about
Bulstrode
have
come
another
fact
affect
Will
's
social
position
,
which
rouse
afresh
Dorothea
's
inward
resistance
to
what
be
say
about
him
in
that
part
of
her
world
which
lie
within
park
paling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Young
Ladislaw
the
grandson
of
a
thieve
Jew
pawnbroker
"
be
a
phrase
which
have
enter
emphatically
into
the
dialogue
about
the
Bulstrode
business
,
at
Lowick
,
Tipton
,
and
Freshitt
,
and
be
a
bad
kind
of
placard
on
poor
Will
be
back
than
the
"
italian
with
white
mouse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Upright
Sir
James
Chettam
be
convince
that
his
own
satisfaction
be
righteous
when
he
think
with
some
complacency
that
here
be
an
add
league
to
that
mountainous
distance
between
Ladislaw
and
Dorothea
,
which
enable
him
to
dismiss
any
anxiety
in
that
direction
as
too
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
there
have
be
some
pleasure
in
point
Mr.
Brooke
's
attention
to
this
ugly
bit
of
Ladislaw
's
genealogy
,
as
a
fresh
candle
for
him
to
see
his
own
folly
by
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
observe
the
animus
with
which
Will
's
part
in
the
painful
story
have
be
recall
more
than
once
;
but
she
have
utter
no
word
,
be
check
now
,
as
she
have
not
be
formerly
in
speak
of
Will
,
by
the
consciousness
of
a
deep
relation
between
them
which
must
always
remain
in
consecrated
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
silence
shroud
her
resistant
emotion
into
a
more
thorough
glow
;
and
this
misfortune
in
Will
's
lot
which
,
it
seem
,
other
be
wish
to
fling
at
his
back
as
an
opprobrium
,
only
give
something
more
of
enthusiasm
to
her
cling
thought
.
  
<EOS>
She
entertain
no
vision
of
their
ever
come
into
nearer
union
,
and
yet
she
have
take
no
posture
of
renunciation
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
accept
her
whole
relation
to
Will
very
simply
as
part
of
her
marriage
sorrow
,
and
would
have
think
it
very
sinful
in
her
to
keep
up
an
inward
wail
because
she
be
not
completely
happy
,
be
rather
disposed
to
dwell
on
the
superfluity
of
her
lot
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
bear
that
the
chief
pleasure
of
her
tenderness
should
lie
in
memory
,
and
the
idea
of
marriage
come
to
her
solely
as
a
repulsive
proposition
from
some
suitor
of
whom
she
at
present
know
nothing
,
but
whose
merit
,
as
see
by
her
friend
,
would
be
a
source
of
torment
to
her
:
 
"
somebody
who
will
manage
your
property
for
you
,
my
dear
,
"
be
Mr.
Brooke
's
attractive
suggestion
of
suitable
characteristic
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
manage
it
myself
,
if
I
know
what
to
do
with
it
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
no
 
she
adhere
to
her
declaration
that
she
would
never
be
marry
again
,
and
in
the
long
valley
of
her
life
which
look
so
flat
and
empty
of
waymark
,
guidance
would
come
as
she
walk
along
the
road
,
and
see
her
fellow
-
passenger
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
this
habitual
state
of
feel
about
Will
Ladislaw
have
be
strong
in
all
her
wake
hour
since
she
have
propose
to
pay
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
make
a
sort
of
background
against
which
she
see
Rosamond
's
figure
present
to
her
without
hindrance
to
her
interest
and
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
evidently
some
mental
separation
,
some
barrier
to
complete
confidence
which
have
arise
between
this
wife
and
the
husband
who
have
yet
make
her
happiness
a
law
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
trouble
which
no
third
person
must
directly
touch
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
think
with
deep
pity
of
the
loneliness
which
must
have
come
upon
Rosamond
from
the
suspicion
cast
on
her
husband
;
and
there
would
surely
be
help
in
the
manifestation
of
respect
for
lydgate
and
sympathy
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
talk
to
her
about
her
husband
,
"
think
Dorothea
,
as
she
be
be
drive
towards
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
the
clear
spring
morning
,
the
scent
of
the
moist
earth
,
the
fresh
leave
just
show
their
crease
-
up
wealth
of
greenery
from
out
their
half
-
open
sheath
,
seem
part
of
the
cheerfulness
she
be
feel
from
a
long
conversation
with
Mr.
Farebrother
,
who
have
joyfully
accept
the
justify
explanation
of
Lydgate
's
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
Mrs.
Lydgate
good
news
,
and
perhaps
she
will
like
to
talk
to
me
and
make
a
friend
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
have
another
errand
in
Lowick
Gate
:
it
be
about
a
new
fine
-
tone
bell
for
the
school
-
house
,
and
as
she
have
to
get
out
of
her
carriage
very
near
to
Lydgate
's
,
she
walk
thither
across
the
street
,
have
tell
the
coachman
to
wait
for
some
package
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
door
be
open
,
and
the
servant
be
take
the
opportunity
of
look
out
at
the
carriage
which
be
pause
within
sight
when
it
become
apparent
to
her
that
the

come
towards
her
.

"
be
Mrs.

say
Dorothea

"
I

my

I
will
see

if
you

to

say
Martha

a
little
confused
on
the
score

<EOS>
She
find
herself
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
without
see
anything
remarkable
,
but
immediately
she
hear
a
voice
speak
in
low
tone
which
startle
her
as
with
a
sense
of
dream
in
daylight
,
and
advance
unconsciously
a
step
or
two
beyond
the
projecting
slab
of
a
bookcase
,
she
see
,
in
the
terrible
illumination
of
a
certainty
which
fill
up
all

something
which

motionless
,
without

she
have

she

Will

by

and

towards

with
a
flushed
tearfulness

while
Will
lean
towards
her
clasped
both
her
upraised
hand
in
his
and
speak
with
low
-
toned
fervor
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
in
her
agitated
absorption
have
not
notice
the
silently
advance
figure
;
but
when
Dorothea
,
after
the
first
immeasurable
instant
of
this
vision
,
move
confusedly
backward
and
find
herself
impede
by
some
piece
of
furniture
,
Rosamond
be
suddenly
aware
of
her
presence
,
and
with
a
spasmodic
movement
snatch
away
her
hand
and
rise
,
look
at
Dorothea
who
be
necessarily
arrest
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
,
start
up
,
look
round
also
,
and
meet
Dorothea
's
eye
with
a
new
lightning
in
them
,
seem
change
to
marble
:
<EOS>
but
she
immediately
turn
them
away
from
him
to
Rosamond
and
say
in
a
firm
voice
    
"
excuse
me
<EOS>
,
Mrs.

<EOS>
She
lay
down
the
letter
on
the
small
table
which
have
check
her
retreat
,
and
then
include
Rosamond
and
Will
in
one
distant
glance
and
bow
,
she
go
quickly
out
of
the
room
,
meet
in
the
passage
the
surprised
Martha
,
who
say
she
be
sorry
the
mistress
be
not
at
home
,
and
then
show
the
strange
lady
out
with
an
inward
reflection
that
grand
people
be
probably
more
impatient
than
other

<EOS>
Dorothea
walk
across
the
street
with
her
most
elastic
step
and
be
quickly
in
her
carriage
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
drive
on
to
Freshitt
Hall
,
"
she
say
to
the
coachman
,
and
any
one
look
at
her
may
have
think
that
though
she
be
paler
than
usual
she
be
never
animate
by
a
more
self
-
possess
energy
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
really
her
experience
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
she
have
drunk
a
great
draught
of
scorn
that
stimulate
her
beyond
the
susceptibility
to
other
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
something
so
far
below
her
belief
,
that
her
emotion
rush
back
from
it
and
make
an
excited
throng
without
an
object
.
 
<EOS>
She
need
something
active
to
turn
her
excitement
out
upon
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
power
to
walk
and
work
for
a
day
,
without
meat
or
drink
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
carry
out
the
purpose
with
which
she
have
start
in
the
morning
,
of
go
to
Freshitt
and
Tipton
to
tell
Sir
James
and
her
uncle
all
that
she
wish
them
to
know
about
Lydgate
,
whose
marry
loneliness
under
his
trial
now
present
itself
to
her
with
new
significance
,
and
make
her
more
ardent
in
readiness
to
be
his
champion
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
never
feel
anything
like
this
triumphant
power
of
indignation
in
the
struggle
of
her
married
life
,
in
which
there
have
always
be
a
quickly
subdue
pang
;
and
she
take
it
as
a
sign
of
new
strength

motionless

they

he
look
towards
the
spot
where
Dorothea
have
stand
,
and
she
look
towards
him
with
doubt

<EOS>
It
seem
an
endless
time
to
Rosamond
,
in
whose
inmost
soul
there
be
hardly
so
much
annoyance
as
gratification
from
what
have
just
happen

<EOS>
shallow
nature
dream
of
an
easy
sway
over
the
emotion

trust
implicitly
in

the

by
pretty

remark

of
make
the

that

though
it
be

<EOS>
She
know
that
Will
have
receive
a
severe
blow
,
but
she
have
be
little
use
to
imagine
other
people
's
state
of
mind
except
as
a
material
cut
into
shape
by
her
own
wish
;
and
she
believe
in
her
own
power
to
soothe
or
subdue
.
 
<EOS>
even
Tertius
,
that
most
perverse
of
man
,
be
always
subdue
in
the
long
-
run
:
event
have
be
obstinate
,
but
still
Rosamond
would
have
say
now
,
as
she
do
before
her
marriage
,
that
she
never
give
up
what
she
have
set
her
mind
on

<EOS>
She
put
out
her
arm
and
lay
the
tip
of
her
finger
on
Will

coat

sleeve

<EOS>
"
do
not

<EOS>
he
say
,
with
an
utterance
like
the
cut
of
a
lash
,
dart
from
her
,
and
change
from
pink
to
white
and
back
again
,
as
if
his
whole
frame
be
tingle
with
the
pain
of
the
sting

<EOS>
He
wheel
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
stand
opposite
to
her
,
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
his
pocket
and
his
head
throw
back
,
look
fiercely
not
at
Rosamond
but
at
a
point
a
few
inch
away
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
keenly
offend
,
but
the
sign
she
make
of
this
be
such
as
only
Lydgate
be
use
to
interpret
.
 
<EOS>
She
become
suddenly
quiet
and
seat
herself
,
untie
her
hang
bonnet
and
lay
it
down
with
her
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
Her
little
hand
which
she
fold
before
her
be
very
cold

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
safe
for
Will
in
the
first
instance
to
have
take
up
his
hat
and
go
away
;
but
he
have
feel
no
impulse
to
do
this
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
have
a
horrible
inclination
to
stay
and
shatter
Rosamond
with
his
anger

<EOS>
It
seem
as
impossible
to
bear
the
fatality
she
have
draw
down
on
him
without

his
fury
as
it
would
be
to
a
panther

the
javelin

and
yet
 
how
could
he
tell
a
woman
that
he
be
ready

<EOS>
He
be
fume
under

repressive
law
which
he
be
force
to

he
be
dangerously

and
Rosamond

voice
now
bring
the
decisive
vibration

in
flute
-
like
tone
of
sarcasm
she

he
burst
out
,
with

sharp
edge
in

"

prey

He
find
another

rosamond
,
while
these
poison
weapon
be
be
hurl
at
her
,
be
almost
lose
the
sense
of
her
identity
,
and
seem
to
be
wake
into
some
new
terrible
existence

<EOS>
She
have
no
sense
of
chill
resolute
repulsion
,
of
reticent
self
-
justification
such
as
she
have
know
under
Lydgate
's
most
stormy
displeasure
:
all
her
sensibility
be
turn
into
a
bewilder
novelty
of
pain
;
she
feel
a
new
terrified
recoil
under
a
lash
never
experience
before
.
 
<EOS>
what
another
nature
feel
in
opposition
to

burn

into

consciousness

<EOS>
when
Will
have
cease
to
speak
she
have
become
an
image
of
sickened
misery
:
her
lip
be
pale
,
and
her
eye
have
a
tearless
dismay
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
Tertius
who
stand
opposite
to
her
,
that
look
of
misery
would
have
be
a
pang
to
him
,
and
he
would
have
sink
by
her
side
to
comfort
her
,
with
that
strong
-
armed
comfort
which
,
she
have
often
hold
very
cheap
.
  
<EOS>
let
it
be
forgive
to
Will
that
he
have
no
such
movement
of
pity
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
feel
no
bond
beforehand
to
this
woman
who
have
spoil
the
ideal
treasure
of
his
life
,
and
he
hold
himself
blameless
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
cruel
,
but
he
have
no
relenting
in
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
after
he
have
do
speak
,
he
still
move
about
,
half
in
absence
of
mind
,
and
Rosamond
sit
perfectly
still
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
Will
,
seem
to
bethink
himself
,
take
up
his
hat
,
yet
stand
some
moment
irresolute
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
her
in
a
way
that
make
a
phrase
of
common
politeness
difficult
to
utter
;
and
yet
,
now
that
he
have
come
to
the
point
of
go
away
from
her
without
further
speech
,
he
shrink
from
it
as
a
brutality
;
he
feel
check
and
stultify
in
his
anger
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
towards
the
mantel
-
piece
and
lean
his
arm
on
it
,
and
wait
in
silence
for
 
he
hardly
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
the
vindictive
fire
be
still
burn
in
him
,
and
he
could
utter
no
word
of
retractation
;
but
it
be
nevertheless
in
his
mind
that
have
come
back
to
this
hearth
where
he
have
enjoy
a
caress
friendship
he
have
find
calamity
seat
there
 
he
have
have
suddenly
reveal
to
him
a
trouble
that
lie
outside
the
home
as
well
as
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
seem
a
foreboding
be
press
upon
him
as
with
slow
pincer
:
 
that
his
life
may
come
to
be
enslave
by
this
helpless
woman
who
have
throw
herself
upon
him
in
the
dreary
sadness
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
in
gloomy
rebellion
against
the
fact
that
his
quick
apprehensiveness
foreshadow
to
him
,
and
<EOS>
when
his
eye
fall
on
Rosamond
's
blight
face
it
seem
to
him
that
he
be
the
more
pitiable
of
the
two
;
for
pain
must
enter
into
its
glorify
life
of
memory
before
it
can
turn
into
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
they
remain
for
many
minute

opposite
each
other
,
far
apart
,
in
silence
<EOS>
;
Will
's
face
still
possess
by
a
mute
rage
,
and
Rosamond
's
by
a
mute
misery
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
have
no
force
to
fling
out
any
passion
in
return
;
the
terrible
collapse
of
the
illusion
towards
which
all
her
hope
have
be
strain
be
a
stroke
which
have
too
thoroughly
shake
her
:
her
little
world
be
in
ruin
,
and
she
feel
herself
totter
in
the
midst
as
a
lonely
bewilder
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Will
wish
that
she
would
speak
and
bring
some
mitigate
shadow
across
his
own
cruel
speech
,
which
seem
to
stand
stare
at
them
both
in
mockery
of
any
attempt
at
revive
fellowship

<EOS>
but
she
say
nothing
,
and
at
last
with
a
desperate
effort
over
himself
,
he
ask
,
"
Shall
I
come
in
and
see
Lydgate
this
evening
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
like
,
"
Rosamond
answer
,
just
audibly
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Will
go
out
of
the
house
,
<EOS>
Martha
never
know
that
he
have
be
in
.
  
<EOS>
after
he
be
go
,
Rosamond
try
to
get
up
from
her
seat
,
but
fall
back
fainting
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
herself
again
,
she
feel
too
ill
to
make
the
exertion
of
rise
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
she
remain
helpless
until
the
girl
,
surprised
at
her
long
absence
,
think
for
the
first
time
of
look
for
her
in
all
the
down
-
stair
room
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
say
that
she
have
feel
suddenly
sick
and
faint
,
and
want
to
be
help
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
when
there
she
throw
herself
on
the
bed
with
her
clothe
on
,
and
lie
in
apparent
torpor
,
as
she
have
do
once
before
on
a
memorable
day
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
lydgate
come
home
earlier
than
he
have
expect
,
about
half
-
past
five
,
and
find
her
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
perception
that
she
be
ill
throw
every
other
thought
into
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
feel
her
pulse
,
her
eye
rest
on
him
with
more
persistence
than
they
have
do
for
a
long
while
,
as
if
she
feel
some
content
that
he
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
perceive
the
difference
in
a
moment
,
and
seat
himself
by
her
put
his
arm
gently
under
her
,
and
bend
over
her
say
,
"
My
poor
rosamond
!
<EOS>
have
something
agitate
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
cling
to
him
<EOS>
she
fall
into
hysterical
sobbing
and
cry
,
and
for
the
next
hour
he
do
nothing
but
soothe
and
tend
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
imagine
that
Dorothea
have
be
to
see
her
,
and
that
all
this
effect
on
her
nervous
system
,
which
evidently
involve
some
new
turning
towards
himself
,
be
due
to
the
excitement
of
the
new
impression
which
that
visit
have
raise
.
        
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
see
in
my
dream
,
that
just
as
they
have
end
their
    
talk
,
they
draw
nigh
to
a
very
miry
slough
,
that
be
in
the
    
midst
of
the
plain
;
and
they
,
be
heedless
,
do
both
fall
    
suddenly
into
the
bog
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
slough
be
    
Despond

"
 
BUNYAN
.
  
<EOS>
when
Rosamond
be
quiet
,
and
Lydgate
have
leave
her
,
hope
that
she
may
soon
sleep
under
the
effect
of
an
anodyne
<EOS>
,
he
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
to
fetch
a
book
which
he
have
leave
there
,
mean
to
spend
the
evening
in
his
work
-
room
,
and
he
see
on
the
table
Dorothea
's
letter
address
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
venture
to
ask
Rosamond
if
Mrs.
Casaubon
have
call
,
but
the
reading
of
this
letter
assure
him
of
the
fact
,
for
Dorothea
mention
that
it
be
to
be
carry
by
herself
.
  
<EOS>
when
Will
Ladislaw
come
in
a
little
later
Lydgate
meet
him
with
a
surprise
which
make
it
clear
that
he
have
not
be
tell
of
the
early
visit
,
and
Will
could
not
say
,
"
do
not
Mrs.
Lydgate
tell
you
that
I
come
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Poor
Rosamond
be
ill

"
Lydgate
add
immediately
on
his
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
seriously
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Will
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
 
only
a
slight
nervous
shock
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
some
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
overwrought
lately
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
Ladislaw
,
I
be
an
unlucky
devil
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
go
through
several
round
of
purgatory
since
you
leave
,
and
I
have
lately
get
on
to
a
bad
ledge
of
it
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
be
only
just
come
down
 
<EOS>
you
look
rather
batter
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
be
long
enough
in
the
town
to
hear
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
travel
all
night
and
get
to
the
White
Hart
at
eight
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
shut
myself
up
and
rest
,
"
say
Will
,
feel
himself
a
sneak
,
but
see
no
alternative
to
this
evasion
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
hear
Lydgate
's
account
of
the
trouble
which
Rosamond
have
already
depict
to
him
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
mention
the
fact
of
Will
's
name
be
connect
with
the
public
story
 
this
detail
not
immediately
affect
her
 
<EOS>
and
he
now
hear
it
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
better
to
tell
you
that
your
name
be
mix
up
with
the
disclosure
,
"
say
Lydgate
,
who
could
understand
well
than
most
man
how
Ladislaw
may
be
sting
by
the
revelation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
sure
to
hear
it
as
soon
as
you
turn
out
into
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
true
that
Raffles
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Will
,
sardonically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
fortunate
if
gossip
do
not
make
me
the
most
disreputable
person
in
the
whole
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
the
late
version
must
be
,
that
I
plot
with
raffle
to
murder
Bulstrode
,
and
run
away
from
Middlemarch
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
think
"
here
be
a
new
ring
in
the
sound
of
my
name
to
recommend
it
in
her
hearing
;
however
 
what
do
it
signify
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
say
nothing
of
Bulstrode
's
offer
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
very
open
and
careless
about
his
personal
affair
,
but
it
be
among
the
more
exquisite
touch
in
nature
's
modelling
of
him
that
he
have
a
delicate
generosity
which
warn
him
into
reticence
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
shrink
from
say
that
he
have
reject
Bulstrode
's
money
,
in
the
moment
when
he
be
learn
that
it
be
Lydgate
's
misfortune
to
have
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lydgate
too
be
reticent
in
the
midst
of
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
allusion
to
Rosamond
's
feeling
under
their
trouble
,
and
of
Dorothea
he
only
say
,
"
Mrs.
Casaubon
have
be
the
one
person
to
come
forward
and
say
that
she
have
no
belief
in
any
of
the
suspicion
against
me
.
"
<EOS>
observe
a
change
in
Will
's
face
,
he
avoid
any
further
mention
of
her
,
feel
himself
too
ignorant
of
their
relation
to
each
other
not
to
fear
that
his
word
may
have
some
hide
painful
bearing
on
it
.
<EOS>
and
it
occur
to
him
that
Dorothea
be
the
real
cause
of
the
present
visit
to
Middlemarch
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
pity
each
other
,
but
it
be
only
Will
who
guess
the
extent
of
his
companion
's
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
when
Lydgate
speak
with
desperate
resignation
of
go
to
settle
in
London
,
and
say
with
a
faint
smile
,
"
We
shall
have
you
again
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
Will
feel
inexpressibly
mournful
,
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
that
morning
entreat
him
to
urge
this
step
on
Lydgate
;
and
it
seem
to
him
as
if
he
be
behold
in
a
magic
panorama
a
future
where
he
himself
be
slide
into
that
pleasureless
yield
to
the
small
solicitation
of
circumstance
,
which
be
a
commoner
history
of
perdition
than
any
single
momentous
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
on
a
perilous
margin
when
we
begin
to
look
passively
at
our
future
self
,
and
see
our
own
figure
lead
with
dull
consent
into
insipid
misdoing
and
shabby
achievement

<EOS>
Poor
Lydgate
be
inwardly
groan
on
that
margin
,
and
Will
be
arrive
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
this
evening
as
if
the
cruelty
of
his
outburst
to
Rosamond
have
make
an
obligation
for
him
,
and
he
dread
the
obligation
:
he
dread
Lydgate
's
unsuspecting
good
-
will
:
he
dread
his
own
distaste
for
his
spoiled
life

which
would
leave
him
in
motiveless
levity

when

in
the
morning
,
she
have
promise
to
go
and
dine
at
the
parsonage
on
her
return
from
Freshitt
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
frequent
interchange
of
visit
between
her
and
the
Farebrother
family
,
which
enable
her
to
say
that
she
be
not
at
all
lonely
at
the
Manor
,
and
to
resist
for
the
present
the
severe
prescription
of
a
lady
companion
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
reach
home
and
remember
her
engagement
,
she
be
glad
of
it
;
and
find
that
she
have
still
an
hour
before
she
could
dress
for
dinner
,
she
walk
straight
to
the
schoolhouse
and
enter
into
a
conversation
with
the
master
and
mistress
about
the
new
bell
,
give
eager
attention
to
their
small
detail
and
repetition
,
and
get
up
a
dramatic
sense
that
her
life
be
very
busy
.
 
<EOS>
She
pause
on
her
way
back
to
talk
to
old
Master
Bunney
who
be
put
in
some
garden
-
seed
,
and
discourse
wisely
with
that
rural
sage
about
the
crop
that
would
make
the
most
return
on
a
perch
of
ground
,
and
the
result
of
sixty
year
'
experience
as
to
soil
 
namely
,
that
if
your
soil
be
pretty
mellow
it
would
do
,
but
if
there
come
wet
,
wet
,
wet
to
make
it
all
of
a

why
then
    
Finding
that
the
social
spirit

beguile
her
into

rather
late

she
dress
hastily
and
go
over
to
the

rather
earlier
than

out
    
"
oh
,
I
do
love
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
hour
in
which
the
wave
of
suffering
shake
her
too
thoroughly
to
leave
any
power
of
thought
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
only
cry
in
loud
whisper
,
between
her
sobs
,
after
her
lose
belief
which
she
have
plant
and
keep
alive
from
a
very
little
seed
since
the
day
in
Rome
 
after
her
lost
joy
of
cling
with
silent
love
and
faith
to
one
who
,
misprize
by
other
,
be
worthy
in
her
thought
 
after
her
lost
woman
's
pride
of
reign
in
his
memory
 
after
her
sweet
dim
perspective
of
hope
,
that
along
some
pathway
they
should
meet
with
unchanged
recognition
and
take
up
the
backward
year
as
a
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
in
that
hour
she
repeat
what
the
merciful
eye
of
solitude
have
look
on
for
age
in
the
spiritual
struggle
of
man
 
<EOS>
she
beseech
hardness
and
coldness
and
ache
weariness
to
bring
her
relief
from
the
mysterious
incorporeal
might
of
her
anguish
:
she
lie
on
the
bare
floor
and
let
the
night
grow
cold
around
her
;
while
her
grand
woman
's
frame
be
shake
by
sobs
as
if
she
have
be
a
despair
child
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
image
 
two
live
form
that
tear
her
heart
in
two
,
as
if
it
have
be
the
heart
of
a
mother
who
seem
to
see
her
child
divide
by
the
sword
,
and
press
one
bleed
half
to
her
breast
while
her
gaze
go
forth
in
agony
towards
the
half
which
be
carry
away
by
the
lie
woman
that
have
never
know
the
mother
's
pang
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
with
the
nearness
of
an
answering
smile
,
here
within
the
vibrate
bond
of
mutual
speech
,
be
the
bright
creature
whom
she
have
trust
 
who
have
come
to
her
like
the
spirit
of
morning
visit
the
dim
vault
where
she
sit
as
the
bride
of
a
wear
-
out
life
;
and
now
,
with
a
full
consciousness
which
have
never
awaken
before
,
she
stretch
out
her
arm
towards
him
and
cry
with
bitter
cry
that
their
nearness
be
a
parting
vision
:
she
discover
her
passion
to
herself
in
the
unshrinking
utterance
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
,
aloof
,
yet
persistently
with
her
,
move
wherever
she
move
,
be
the
Will
Ladislaw
who
be
a
change
belief
exhaust
of
hope
,
a
detected
illusion
 
<EOS>
no
,
a
live
man
towards
whom
there
could
not
yet
struggle
any
wail
of
regretful
pity
,
from
the
midst
of
scorn
and
indignation
and
jealous
offended
pride
.
 
<EOS>
the
fire
of
Dorothea
's
anger
be
not
easily
spend
,
and
it
flame
out
in
fitful
return
of
spurn
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
come
obtrude
his
life
into
her
,
her
that
may
have
be
whole
enough
without
him
?
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
bring
his
cheap
regard
and
his
lip
-
bear
word
to
her
who
have
nothing
paltry
to
give
in
exchange
?
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
delude
her
 
<EOS>
wish
,
in
the
very
moment
of
farewell
,
to
make
her
believe
that
he
give
her
the
whole
price
of
her
heart
,
and
know
that
he
have
spend
it
half
before
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
stay
among
the
crowd
of
whom
she
ask
nothing
 
but
only
pray
that
they
may
be
less
contemptible
?
  
<EOS>
but
she
lose
energy
at
last
even
for
her
loud
-
whisper
cry
and
moan
:
she
subside
into
helpless
sobs
,
and
on
the
cold
floor
she
sob
herself
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
chill
hour
of
the
morning
twilight
,
when
all
be
dim
around
her
,
she
awake
 
not
with
any
amazed
wondering
where
she
be
or
what
have
happen
,
but
with
the
clear
consciousness
that
she
be
look
into
the
eye
of
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
rise
,
and
wrap
warm
thing
around
her
,
and
seat
herself
in
a
great
chair
where
she
have
often
watch
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
vigorous
enough
to
have
bear
that
hard
night
without
feel
ill
in
body
,
beyond
some
aching
and
fatigue
;
but
she
have
wake
to
a
new
condition
<EOS>
:
she
feel
as
if
her
soul
have
be
liberate
from
its
terrible
conflict
;
she
be
no
longer
wrestle
with
her
grief
,
but
could
sit
down
with
it
as
a
lasting
companion
and
make
it
a
sharer
in
her
thought
.
 
<EOS>
for
now
the
thought
come
thickly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
Dorothea
's
nature
,
for
long
than
the
duration
of
a
paroxysm
,
to
sit
in
the
narrow
cell
of
her
calamity
,
in
the
besotted
misery
of
a
consciousness
that
only
see
another
's
lot
as
an
accident
of
its
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
begin
now
to
live
through
that
yesterday
morning
deliberately
again
,
force
herself
to
dwell
on
every
detail
and
its
possible
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
alone
in
that
scene
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
her
event
only
?
 
<EOS>
She
force
herself
to
think
of
it
as
bind
up
with
another
woman
's
life
 
<EOS>
a
woman
towards
whom
she
have
set
out
with
a
longing
to
carry
some
clearness
and
comfort
into
her
beclouded
youth
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
first
outleap
of
jealous
indignation
and
disgust
,
when
quit
the
hateful
room
,
she
have
fling
away
all
the
mercy
with
which
she
have
undertake
that
visit
.
<EOS>
She
have
envelop
both
Will
and
Rosamond
in
her
burn
scorn
,
and
it
seem
to
her
as
if
Rosamond
be
burn
out
of
her
sight
forever
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
base
prompting
which
make
a
woman
more
cruel
to
a
rival
than
to
a
faithless
lover
,
could
have
no
strength
of
recurrence
in
Dorothea
when
the
dominant
spirit
of
justice
within
her
have
once
overcome
the
tumult
and
have
once
show
her
the
truer
measure
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
active
thought
with
which
she
have
before
be
represent
to
herself
the
trial
of
Lydgate
's
lot
,
and
this
young
marriage
union
which
,
like
her
own
,
seem
to
have
its
hide
as
well
as
evident
trouble
 
<EOS>
all
this
vivid
sympathetic
experience
return
to
her
now
as
a
power
:
it
assert
itself
as
acquire
knowledge
assert
itself
and
will
not
let
us
see
as
we
see
in
the
day
of
our
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
to
her
own
irremediable
grief
,
that
it
should
make
her
more
helpful
,
instead
of
drive
her
back
from
effort
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
sort
of
crisis
may
not
this
be
in
three
life
whose
contact
with
her
lay
an
obligation
on
her
as
if
they
have
be
suppliant
bear
the
sacred
branch
?
 
<EOS>
the
object
of
her
rescue
be
not
to
be
seek
out
by
her
fancy
:
they
be
choose
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
yearn
towards
the
perfect
right
,
that
it
may
make
a
throne
within
her
,
and
rule
her
errant
will
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
should
I
do
 
<EOS>
how
should
I
act
now
,
this
very
day
,
if
I
could
clutch
my
own
pain
,
and
compel
it
to
silence
,
and
think
of
those
three
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
take
long
for
her
to
come
to
that
question
,
and
there
be
light
pierce
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
open
her
curtain
,
and
look
out
towards
the
bit
of
road
that
lie
in
view
,
with
field
beyond
outside
the
entrance
-
gate
.
<EOS>
on
the
road
there
be
a
man
with
a
bundle
on
his
back
and
a
woman
carry
her
baby
;
in
the
field
she
could
see
figure
move
 
perhaps
the
shepherd
with
his
dog
.
 
<EOS>
far
off
in
the
bend
sky
be
the
pearly
light
;
and
she
feel
the
largeness
of
the
world
and
the
manifold
waking
of
man
to
labor
and
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
part
of
that
involuntary
,
palpitate
life
,
and
could
neither
look
out
on
it
from
her
luxurious
shelter
as
a
mere
spectator
,
nor
hide
her
eye
in
selfish
complaining
.
  
<EOS>
what
she
would
resolve
to
do
that
day
do
not
yet
seem
quite
clear
,
but
something
that
she
could
achieve
stir
her
as
with
an
approach
murmur
which
would
soon
gather
distinctness
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
off
the
clothe
which
seem
to
have
some
of
the
weariness
of
a
hard
watching
in
them
,
and
begin
to
make
her
toilet
.
 
<EOS>
presently
she
ring
for
Tantripp
,
who
come
in
her
dressing
-
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
madam
,
you
have
never
be
in
bed
this
bless
night
,
"
burst
out
Tantripp
,
look
first
at
the
bed
and
then
at
Dorothea
's
face
,
which
in
spite
of
bathing
have
the
pale
cheek
and
pink
eyelid
of
a
mater
dolorosa
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
kill
yourself
,
you
_
will
_
.
 
<EOS>
anybody
may
think
now
you
have
a
right
to
give
yourself
a
little
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
be
alarm
,
Tantripp
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sleep
;
I
be
not
ill

<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
of
a
cup
of
coffee
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
and
I
want
you
to
bring
me
my
new
dress

and
most
likely
I
shall
want
my
new
bonnet
to

<EOS>
"
They
have
lain
there
a
month
and
more
ready
for

shall
be
to
see
you
with
a
couple

worth

crape

"
say
Tantripp
,
stoop
to
light
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
reason
in
mourning
,
as
I
have
always
say
;
and
three
fold
at
the
bottom
of
your
skirt
and
a
plain
quilling
in
your
bonnet

and
if
ever
anybody
look
like
an
angel

it

what

consistent
for

at

,
that
be

<EOS>
my
_
thinking

end
Tantripp
,
look
anxiously
at
the
fire
;
"
and
if
anybody
be
to
marry
me
flattering
himself
I
should
wear
those
hijeous
weeper
two
year
for
him
,
he
would
be
deceive
by
his
own
vanity

that
be
all

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fire
will
do
,
my
good
Tan

"
say
Dorothea
,
speak
as
she
use
to
do
in
the
old
Lausanne
day
,
only
with
a
very
low
voice
;
"
get
me
the
coffee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
fold
herself
in
the
large
chair
,
and
lean
her
head
against
it
in
fatigue
quiescence
,
while
Tantripp
go
away
wonder
at
this
strange
contrariness
in
her
young
mistress
 
<EOS>
that
just
the
morning
when
she
have
more
of
a
widow
's
face
than
ever
,
she
should
have
ask
for
her
light
mourning
which
she
have
waive
before
.
 
<EOS>
Tantripp
would
never
have
find
the
clew
to
this
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
wish
to
acknowledge
that
she
have
not
the
less
an
active
life
before
her
because
she
have
bury
a
private
joy
;
and
the
tradition
that
fresh
garment
belong
to
all
initiation
,
haunt
her
mind
,
make
her
grasp
after
even
that
slight
outward
help
towards
calm
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
resolve
be
not
easy
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
at
eleven
o'clock
she
be
walk
towards
Middlemarch
,
have
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
make
as
quietly
and
unnoticeably
as
possible
her
second
attempt
to
see
and
save
Rosamond

in
the

close
by

"
I
have
no

suppress

<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
Lydgate
,
as
Dorothea
have
expect
,
know
nothing
about
the
circumstance
of
her
yesterday
's
visit
;
nay
,
he
appear
to
imagine
that
she
have
carry
it
out
accord

She
have
prepare

to

would
have

after
lead
her
into

he
pause
to
take
a
letter
from

put
it
into

her
habitual

have
say
,
"
Ladislaw
be
come
,
Rosy
;
he
sit
with
me
last
night
<EOS>
;
I
dare
say
he
will
be
here
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
look
rather
battered
and
depressed
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
Rosamond
have
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
when
he
come
up
,
he
say
to
her
very
gently
,
"
rosy
,
dear
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
be
come
to
see
you
again
;
you
would
like
to
see
her
,
would
you
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
that
she
color
and
give
rather
a
startled
movement
do
not
surprise
him
after
the
agitation
produce
by
the
interview
yesterday
 
a
beneficent
agitation
,
he
think
,
since
it
seem
to
have
make
her
turn
to
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
dare
not
say
no
.
 
<EOS>
She
dare
not
with
a
tone
of
her
voice
touch
the
fact
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
Mrs.
Casaubon
come
again
?
 
<EOS>
the
answer
be
a
blank
<EOS>
which
Rosamond
could
only
fill
up
with
dread
,
for
Will
<EOS>
Ladislaw
's
lacerating
word
have
make
every
thought
of
Dorothea
a
fresh
smart
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
in
her
new
humiliating
uncertainty
she
dare
do
nothing
but
comply
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
say
yes
,
but
she
rise
and
let
Lydgate
put
a
light
shawl
over
her
shoulder
,
while
he
say
,
"
I
be
go
out
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
something
cross
her
mind
which
prompt
her
to
say
,
"
pray
tell
Martha
not
to
bring
any
one
else
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lydgate
assent
,
think
that
he
fully
understand
this
wish
.
 
<EOS>
He
lead
her
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
and
then
turn
away
,
observe
to
himself
that
he
be
rather
a
blunder
husband
to
be
dependent
for
his
wife
's
trust
in
him
on
the
influence
of
another
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
wrap
her
soft
shawl
around
her
as
she
walk
towards
Dorothea
,
be
inwardly
wrap
her
soul
in
cold
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
have
Mrs.
Casaubon
come
to
say
anything
to
her
about
Will
?
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
it
be
a
liberty
that
Rosamond
resent
;
and
she
prepare
herself
to
meet
every
word
with
polite
impassibility
.
 
<EOS>
Will
have
bruise
her
pride
too
sorely
for
her
to
feel
any
compunction
towards
him
and
Dorothea
:
her
own
injury
seem
much
the
great
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
be
not
only
the
"
preferred
"
woman
,
but
have
also
a
formidable
advantage
in
be
Lydgate
's
benefactor
;
and
to
poor
Rosamond
's
pain
confused
vision
it
seem
that
this
Mrs.
Casaubon
 
<EOS>
this
woman
who
predominate
in
all
thing
concern
her
 
must
have
come
now
with
the
sense
of
have
the
advantage
,
and
with
animosity
prompt
her
to
use
it
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
not
Rosamond
only
,
but
any
one
else
,
know
the
outer
fact
of
the
case
,
and
not
the
simple
inspiration
on
which
Dorothea
act
,
may
well
have
wonder
why
she
come
.
  
<EOS>
look
like
the
lovely
ghost
of
herself
,
her
graceful
slimness
wrap
in
her
soft
white
shawl
,
the
rounded
infantine
mouth
and
cheek
inevitably
suggest
mildness
and
innocence
,
Rosamond
pause
at
three
yard
'
distance
from
her
visitor
and
bow
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
,
who
have
take
off
her
glove
,
from
an
impulse
which
she
could
never
resist
when
she
want
a
sense
of
freedom
,
come
forward
,
and
with
her
face
full
of
a
sad
yet
sweet
openness
,
put
out
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
could
not
avoid
meet
her
glance
,
could
not
avoid
put
her
small
hand
into
Dorothea
's
,
which
clasp
it
with
gentle
motherliness
;
and
immediately
a
doubt
of
her
own
prepossession
begin
to
stir
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
's
eye
be
quick
for
face
;
she
see
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
's
face
look
pale
and
change
since
yesterday
,
yet
gentle
,
and
like
the
firm
softness
of
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
Dorothea
have
count
a
little
too
much
on
her
own
strength
:
<EOS>
the
clearness
and
intensity
of
her
mental
action
this
morning
be
the
continuance
of
a
nervous
exaltation
which
make
her
frame
as
dangerously
responsive
as
a
bit
of
fine
venetian
crystal
;
and
in
look
at
Rosamond
,
she
suddenly
find
her
heart
swell
,
and
be
unable
to
speak
 
all
her
effort
be
require
to
keep
back
tear
.
 
<EOS>
She
succeed
in
that
,
and
the
emotion
only
pass
over
her
face
like
the
spirit
of
a
sob
;
but
it
add
to
Rosamond
's
impression
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
's
state
of
mind
must
be
something
quite
different
from
what
she
have
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
sit
down
without
a
word
of
preface
on
the
two
chair
that
happen
to
be
near
,
and
happen
also
to
be
close
together
;
though
Rosamond
's
notion
when
she
first
bow
be
that
she
should
stay
a
long
way
off
from
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
cease
think
how
anything
would
turn
out
 
merely
wonder
what
would
come
.
 
<EOS>
and
Dorothea
begin
to
speak
quite
simply
,
gather
firmness
as
she
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
errand
yesterday
which
I
do
not
finish
;
that
be
why
I
be
here
again
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
think
me
too
troublesome
when
I
tell
you
that
I
come
to
talk
to
you
about
the
injustice
that
have
be
show
towards
Mr.
Lydgate
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
cheer
you
 
<EOS>
will
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
to
know
a
great
deal
about
him
,
that
he
may
not
like
to
speak
about
himself
just
because
it
be
in
his
own
vindication
and
to
his
own
honor
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
like
to
know
that
your
husband
have
warm
friend
,
who
have
not
leave
off
believe
in
his
high
character
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
speak
of
this
without
think
that
I
take
a
liberty
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
cordial
,
plead
tone
which
seem
to
flow
with
generous
heedlessness
above
all
the
fact
which
have
fill
Rosamond
's
mind
as
ground
of
obstruction
and
hatred
between
her
and
this
woman
,
come
as
soothingly
as
a
warm
stream
over
her
shrink
fear
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
Mrs.
Casaubon
have
the
fact
in
her
mind
,
but
she
be
not
go
to
speak
of
anything
connect
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
relief
be
too
great
for
Rosamond
to
feel
much
else
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
She
answer
prettily
,
in
the
new
ease
of
her
soul
    
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
have
be
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
like
to
hear
anything
you
will
say
to
me
about
Tertius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
day
before
yesterday
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
"
when
I
have
ask
him
to
come
to
Lowick
to
give
me
his
opinion
on
the
affair
of
the
Hospital
,
he
tell
me
everything
about
his
conduct
and
feeling
in
this
sad
event
which
have
make
ignorant
people
cast
suspicion
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
he
tell
me
be
because
I
be
very
bold
and
ask
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
have
never
act
dishonorably
,
and
I
beg
him
to
tell
me
the
history
.
<EOS>
He
confess
to
me
that
he
have
never
tell
it
before
,
not
even
to
you
,
because
he
have
a
great
dislike
to
say
,
"
I
be
not
wrong
,
"
as
if
that
be
proof
,
when
there
be
guilty
people
who
will
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
know
nothing
of
this
man
Raffles
,
or
that
there
be
any
bad
secret
about
him
;
and
he
think
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
offer
him
the
money
because
he
repent
,
out
of
kindness
,
of
have
refuse
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
anxiety
about
his
patient
be
to
treat
him
rightly
,
and
he
be
a
little
uncomfortable
that
the
case
do
not
end
as
he
have
expect
;
but
he
think
then
and
still
think
that
there
may
have
be
no
wrong
in
it
on
any
one
's
part
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
tell
Mr.
Farebrother
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
Sir
James
Chettam
:
they
all
believe
in
your
husband
.
<EOS>
that
will
cheer
you
,
will
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
that
will
give
you
courage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
's
face
have
become
animate
,
and
as
it
beam
on
Rosamond
very
close
to
her
,
she
feel
something
like
bashful
timidity
before
a
superior
,
in
the
presence
of
this
self
-
forgetful
ardor
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
with
blush
embarrassment
,
"
thank
you
:
<EOS>
you
be
very
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
feel
that
he
have
be
so
wrong
not
to
pour
out
everything
about
this
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
because
he
feel
so
much
more
about
your
happiness
than
anything
else
 
<EOS>
he
feel
his
life
bind
into
one
with
yours
,
and
it
hurt
him
more
than
anything
,
that
his
misfortune
must
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
speak
to
me
because
I
be
an
indifferent
person
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
ask
him
if
I
may
come
to
see
you
;
because
I
feel
so
much
for
his
trouble
and
yours
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
come
yesterday
,
and
why
I
be
come
to
-
day

trouble
be
so
hard
to
bear

it
not

<EOS>
how
can
we
live
and
think
that
any
one
have
trouble
 
pierce
trouble
 
and
we
could
help
them
,
and
never
try
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
,
completely
sway
by
the
feeling
that
she
be
utter
,
forget
everything
but
that
she
be
speak
from
out
the
heart
of
her
own
trial
to
Rosamond
's
.
<EOS>
the
emotion
have
work
itself
more
and
more
into
her
utterance
,
till
the
tone
may
have
go
to
one
be
very
marrow
,
like
a
low
cry
from
some
suffer
creature
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
unconsciously
lay
her
hand
again
on
the
little
hand
that
she
have
press
before
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
,
with
an
overmaster
pang
,
as
if
a
wound
within
her
have
be
probe
,
burst
into
hysterical
crying
as
she
have
do
the
day
before
when
she
cling
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothea
be
feel
a
great
wave
of
her
own
sorrow
return
over
her
 
her
thought
be
draw
to
the
possible
share
that
Will
Ladislaw
may
have
in
Rosamond
's
mental
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
begin
to
fear
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
suppress
herself
enough
to
the
end
of
this
meeting
,
and
while
her
hand
be
still
rest
on
Rosamond
's
lap
,
though
the
hand
underneath
it
be
withdraw
,
she
be
struggle
against
her
own
rise
sobs
.
 
<EOS>
She
try
to
master
herself
with
the
thought
that
this
may
be
a
turning
-
point
in
three
life
 
not
in
her
own
;
no
,
there
the
irrevocable
have
happen
,
but
 
in
those
three
life
which
be
touch
her
with
the
solemn
neighborhood
of
danger
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
the
fragile
creature
who
be
cry
close
to
her
 
there
may
still
be
time
to
rescue
her
from
the
misery
of
false
incompatible
bond
;
and
this
moment
be
unlike
any
other
:
she
and
Rosamond
could
never
be
together
again
with
the
same
thrilling
consciousness
of
yesterday
within
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
the
relation
between
them
to
be
peculiar
enough
to
give
her
a
peculiar
influence
,
though
she
have
no
conception
that
the
way
in
which
her
own
feeling
be
involve
be
fully
know
to
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
new
crisis
in
Rosamond
's
experience
than
even
Dorothea
could
imagine
:
she
be
under
the
first
great
shock
that
have
shatter
her
dream
-
world
in
which
she
have
be
easily
confident
of
herself
and
critical
of
other
;
and
this
strange
unexpected
manifestation
of
feel
in
a
woman
whom
she
have
approach
with
a
shrink
aversion
and
dread
,
as
one
who
must
necessarily
have
a
jealous
hatred
towards
her
,
make
her
soul
totter
all
the
more
with
a
sense
that
she
have
be
walk
in
an
unknown
world
which
have
just
break
in
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
Rosamond
's
convulsed
throat
be
subside
into
calm
,
and
she
withdraw
the
handkerchief
with
which
she
have
be
hide
her
face
,
her
eye
meet
Dorothea
's
as
helplessly
as
if
they
have
be
blue
flower
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
think
about
behavior
after
this
crying
?
 
<EOS>
and
Dorothea
look
almost
as
childish
,
with
the
neglect
trace
of
a
silent
tear
.
 
<EOS>
Pride
be
break
down
between
these
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
talk
about
your
husband
,
"
Dorothea
say
,
with
some
timidity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
his
look
be
sadly
change
with
suffer
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
him
for
many
week
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
be
feel
very
lonely
in
his
trial
;
but
I
think
he
would
have
bear
it
all
better
if
he
have
be
able
to
be
quite
open
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tertius
be
so
angry
and
impatient
if
I
say
anything
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
imagine
that
he
have
be
complain
of
her
to
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
ought
not
to
wonder
that
I
object
to
speak
to
him
on
painful
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
himself
he
blame
for
not
speak
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
he
say
of
you
be
,
that
he
could
not
be
happy
in
do
anything
which
make
you
unhappy
 
that
his
marriage
be
of
course
a
bond
which
must
affect
his
choice
about
everything
;
and
for
that
reason
he
refuse
my
proposal
that
he
should
keep
his
position
at
the
Hospital
,
because
that
would
bind
him
to
stay
in
Middlemarch
,
and
he
would
not
undertake
to
do
anything
which
would
be
painful
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
say
that
to
me
,
because
he
know
that
I
have
much
trial
in
my
marriage
,
from
my
husband
's
illness
,
which
hinder
his
plan
and
sadden
him
;
and
he
know
that
I
have
feel
how
hard
it
be
to
walk
always
in
fear
of
hurt
another
who
be
tie
to
us

Dorothea
wait
a
little
;
she
have
discern
a
faint
pleasure
steal
over
Rosamond
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
answer
,
and
she
go
on
,
with
a
gathering
tremor
,
"
marriage
be
so
unlike
everything
else

there
be
something
even
awful
in
the
nearness
it
bring

Her
voice
have
sink
very
low

there
be
a
dread
upon
her
of

of
speak
as

She

preoccupied

her
own
anxiety

to
be
aware
that
Rosamond
be
tremble
too
;
and
fill
with
the
need
to
express
pity
fellowship
rather
than
rebuke
,
she
put
her
hand
on
Rosamond
's
,
and
say
with
more
agitated
rapidity
,
 
"

the

from
out
of
which

save
another

rush
over

She

<EOS>
Her

have
become
of
a
deathli
paleness

her
lip

she
press
her
hand
helplessly
on
the
hand

lie
under

Rosamond

take
hold
of
by
an
emotion
strong
than
her
own
 
hurried
along
in
a
new
movement

give
all
thing
<EOS>
some
new
,
awful
,
undefined
aspect
 
could
find
no
word

but
involuntarily
she
put
her
lip
to
Dorothea
's
forehead
which
be
very
near
her
,
and
then
for
a
minute
the
two
woman
clasp
each
other
as
if
they
have
be
in
a
shipwreck
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
think
what

"

Rosamond
,
in
an
eager
half
-
whisper
,
while
she
be
still
feel
Dorothea
's
arm
round
her
 
urge
by
a
mysterious
necessity
to
free
herself
from
something
that
oppress
her
as

blood
guiltiness

They
move
apart

at

"
when

come
in

it

not

Rosamond
in
the

tone
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
movement
of
surprised
attention
in
Dorothea

<EOS>
She
expect
a
vindication
of

"
He

more
and

on

now
I

any

"
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
deliver
her
soul
under
impulse
which
she
have
not
know
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
begin
her
confession
under
the
subdue
influence
of
Dorothea
's
emotion
;
and
as
she
go
on
she
have
gather
the
sense
that
she
be
repel
Will
's
reproach
,
which
be
still
like
a
knife
-
wound
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
revulsion
of
feeling
in
Dorothea
be
too
strong
to
be
call
joy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
tumult
in
which
the
terrible
strain
of
the
night
and
morning
make
a
resistant
pain
:
 
<EOS>
she
could
only
perceive
that
this
would
be
joy
when
she
have
recover
her
power
of
feel
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
immediate
consciousness
be
one
of
immense
sympathy
without
check
;
she
care
for
Rosamond
without
struggle
now
,
and
respond
earnestly
to
her
last
word
    
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
can
not
reproach
you
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
her
usual
tendency
to
over
-
estimate
the
good
in
other
,
she
feel
a
great
outgoing
of
her
heart
towards
Rosamond
,
for
the
generous
effort
which
have
redeem
her
from
suffer
,
not
count
that
the
effort
be
a
reflex
of
her
own
energy
.
 
<EOS>
after
they
have
be
silent
a
little
,
she
say
    
"
You
be
not
sorry
that
I
come
this
morning

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

you

I

the
bad

would
be
to
lose

you
have
not

it

"
say
Dorothea
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
to
thrust
away
the
too
overpowering
thought
of
her
own
relief
,
lest
she
should
fail
to
win
some
sign
that
Rosamond
's
affection
be
yearn
back
towards
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tertius
do
not
find
fault
with
me
,
then
?
"
say
Rosamond
,
understand
now
that
Lydgate
may
have
say
anything
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
that
she
certainly
be
different
from
other
woman
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
a
faint
taste
of
jealousy
in
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
a
smile
begin
to
play
over
Dorothea
's
face
as
she
say
    
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
how
could
you
imagine
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
here
the
door
open
,
and
Lydgate
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
back
in
my
quality
of
doctor
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
after
I
go
away
,
I
be
haunt
by
two
pale
face
:
Mrs.
Casaubon
look
as
much
in
need
of
care
as
you
,
Rosy
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
I
have
not
do
my
duty
in
leave
you
together
;
so
when
I
have
be
to
Coleman
's
I
come
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
you
be
walk
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
the
sky
have
change
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
may
have
rain
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
send
some
one
to
order
your
carriage
to
come
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
strong
<EOS>
:
I
need
the
walk
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
rise
with
animation
in
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Lydgate
and
I
have
chat
a
great
deal
,
and
it
be
time
for
me
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
be
accuse
of
be
immoderate
and
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
to
Rosamond
,
and
they
say
an
earnest
,
quiet
good
-
by
without
kiss
or
other
show
of
effusion
:
there
have
be
between
them
too
much
serious
emotion
for
them
to
use
the
sign
of
it
superficially
.
  
<EOS>
as
Lydgate
take
her
to
the
door
she
say
nothing
of
Rosamond
,
but
tell
him
of
Mr.
Farebrother
and
the
other
friend
who
have
listen
with
belief
to
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
back
to
Rosamond
,
she
have
already
throw
herself
on
the
sofa
,
in
resigned
fatigue
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Rosy
,
"
he
say
,
stand
over
her
,
and
touch
her
hair
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
<EOS>
now
you
have
see
so
much
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
must
be
well
than
any
one
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
"
and
<EOS>
she
be
very
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
go
to
talk
to
her
so
often
,
you
will
be
more
discontent
with
me
than
ever
!
"
  
<EOS>
lydgate
laugh
at
the
"
so
often
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
have
she
make
you
any
less
discontented
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
have
,
"
say
Rosamond
,
look
up
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
heavy
your
eye
be
,
<EOS>
Tertius
 
and
do
push
your
hair
back
.
"
<EOS>
He
lift
up
his
large
white
hand
to
obey
her
,
and
feel
thankful
for
this
little
mark
of
interest
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Rosamond
's
vagrant
fancy
have
come
back
terribly
scourge
 
<EOS>
meek
enough
to
nestle
under
the
old
despised
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
shelter
be
still
there
<EOS>
:
lydgate
have
accept
his
narrow
lot
with
sad
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
choose
this
fragile
creature
,
and
have
take
the
burthen
of
her
life
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
walk
as
he
could
,
carry
that
burthen
pitifully
.
        
<EOS>

My
grief
lie
onward
and

<EOS>
exile
notoriously
feed
much
on
hope
,
and
be
unlikely
to
stay
in
banishment
unless
they
be
oblige
.
 
<EOS>
when
Will
Ladislaw
exile
himself
from
Middlemarch
he
have
place
no
strong
obstacle
to
his
return
than
his
own
resolve
,
which
be
by
no
mean
an
iron
barrier
,
but
simply
a
state
of
mind
liable
to
melt
into
a
minuet
with
other
state
of
mind
,
and
to
find
itself
bow
,
smile
,
and
give
place
with
polite
facility
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
month
go
on
,
it
have
seem
more
and
more
difficult
to
him
to
say
why
he
should
not
run
down
to
Middlemarch
 
merely
for
the
sake
of
hear
something
about
Dorothea
;
and
if
on
such
a
flying
visit
he
should
chance
by
some
strange
coincidence
to
meet
with
her
,
there
be
no
reason
for
him
to
be
ashamed
of
have
take
an
innocent
journey
which
he
have
beforehand
suppose
that
he
should
not
take
.
 
<EOS>
since
he
be
hopelessly
divide
from
her
,
he
may
surely
venture
into
her
neighborhood
;
and
as
to
the
suspicious
friend
who
keep
a
dragon
watch
over
her
 
their
opinion
seem
less
and
less
important
with
time
and
change
of
air
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
have
come
a
reason
quite
irrespective
of
Dorothea
,
which
seem
to
make
a
journey
to
Middlemarch
a
sort
of
philanthropic
duty
.
<EOS>
Will
have
give
a
disinterested
attention
to
an
intend
settlement
on
a
new
plan
in
the
Far
West
,
and
the
need
for
fund
in
order
to
carry
out
a
good
design
have
set
him
on
debate
with
himself
whether
it
would
not
be
a
laudable
use
to
make
of
his
claim
on
Bulstrode
,
to
urge
the
application
of
that
money
which
have
be
offer
to
himself
as
a
means
of
carry
out
a
scheme
likely
to
be
largely
beneficial
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
seem
a
very
dubious
one
to
Will
,
and
his
repugnance
to
again
enter
into
any
relation
with
the
banker
may
have
make
him
dismiss
it
quickly
,
if
there
have
not
arise
in
his
imagination
the
probability
that
his
judgment
may
be
more
safely
determine
by
a
visit
to
Middlemarch
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
object
which
Will
state
to
himself
as
a
reason
for
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
mean
to
confide
in
Lydgate
,
and
discuss
the
money
question
with
him
,
and
he
have
mean
to
amuse
himself
for
the
few
evening
of
his
stay
by
have
a
great
deal
of
music
and
badinage
with
fair
Rosamond
,
without
neglect
his
friend
at
Lowick
Parsonage
:
 
if
the
Parsonage
be
close
to
the
Manor
,
that
be
no
fault
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
neglect
the
Farebrothers
before
his
departure
,
from
a
proud
resistance
to
the
possible
accusation
of
indirectly
seek
interview
with
Dorothea
;
but
hunger
tame
us
,
and
Will
have
become
very
hungry
for
the
vision
of
a
certain
form
and
the
sound
of
a
certain
voice
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
have
do
instead
 
not
the
opera
,
or
the
converse
of
zealous
politician
,
or
the
flattering
reception
(
in
dim
corner
)
of
his
new
hand
in
lead
article
.
  
<EOS>
thus
he
have
come
down
,
foresee
with
confidence
how
almost
everything
would
be
in
his
familiar
little
world
;
fearing
,
indeed
,
that
there
would
be
no
surprise
in
his
visit
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
find
that
humdrum
world
in
a
terribly
dynamic
condition
,
in
which
even
badinage
and
lyrism
have
turn
explosive
;
and
the
first
day
of
this
visit
have
become
the
most
fatal
epoch
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
he
feel
so
harassed
with
the
nightmare
of
consequence
 
he
dread
so
much
the
immediate
issue
before
him
 
that
see
while
he
breakfast
the
arrival
of
the
Riverston
coach
,
he
go
out
hurriedly
and
take
his
place
on
it
,
that
he
may
be
relieve
,
at
least
for
a
day
,
from
the
necessity
of
do
or
say
anything
in
Middlemarch
.
 
<EOS>
Will
Ladislaw
be
in
one
of
those
tangle
crisis
which
be
commoner
in
experience
than
one
may
imagine
,
from
the
shallow
absoluteness
of
man
's
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
find
Lydgate
,
for
whom
he
have
the
sincere
respect
,
under
circumstance
which
claim
his
thorough
and
frankly
declare
sympathy
;
and
the
reason
why
,
in
spite
of
that
claim
,
it
would
have
be
well
for
Will
to
have
avoid
all
further
intimacy
,
or
even
contact
,
with
Lydgate
,
be
precisely
of
the
kind
to
make
such
a
course
appear
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
to
a
creature
of
Will
's
susceptible
temperament
 
without
any
neutral
region
of
indifference
in
his
nature
,
ready
to
turn
everything
that
befall
him
into
the
collision
of
a
passionate
drama
 
the
revelation
that
Rosamond
have
make
her
happiness
in
any
way
dependent
on
him
be
a
difficulty
which
his
outburst
of
rage
towards
her
have
immeasurably
increase
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
hate
his
own
cruelty
,
and
yet
he
dread
to
show
the
fulness
of
his
relenting
<EOS>
:
he
must
go
to
her
again
;
the
friendship
could
not
be
put
to
a
sudden
end
;
and
her
unhappiness
be
a
power
which
he
dread
.
 
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
there
be
no
more
foretaste
of
enjoyment
in
the
life
before
him
than
if
his
limb
have
be
lop
off
and
he
be
make
his
fresh
start
on
crutch
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
night
he
have
debate
whether
he
should
not
get
on
the
coach
,
not
for
Riverston
,
but
for
London
,
leave
a
note
to
Lydgate
which
would
give
a
makeshift
reason
for
his
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
strong
cord
pull
him
back
from
that
abrupt
departure
:
<EOS>
the
blight
on
his
happiness
in
thinking
of
Dorothea
,
the
crushing
of
that
chief
hope
which
have
remain
in
spite
of
the
acknowledge
necessity
for
renunciation
,
be
too
fresh
a
misery
for
him
to
resign
himself
to
it
and
go
straightway
into
a
distance
which
be
also
despair
.
  
<EOS>
thus
he
do
nothing
more
decide
than
take
the
Riverston
coach
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
back
again
by
it
while
it
be
still
daylight
,
have
make
up
his
mind
that
he
must
go
to
Lydgate
's
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
the
Rubicon
,
we
know
,
be
a
very
insignificant
stream
to
look
at
;
its
significance
lie
entirely
in
certain
invisible
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Will
feel
as
if
he
be
force
to
cross
his
small
boundary
ditch
,
and
what
he
see
beyond
it
be
not
empire
,
but
discontent
subjection
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
give
to
us
sometimes
even
in
our
every
-
day
life
to
witness
the
saving
influence
of
a
noble
nature
,
the
divine
efficacy
of
rescue
that
may
lie
in
a
self
-
subdue
act
of
fellowship
.
 
<EOS>
if
Dorothea
,
after
her
night
's
anguish
,
have
not
take
that
walk
to
Rosamond
 
<EOS>
why
,
she
perhaps
would
have
be
a
woman
who
gain
a
high
character
for
discretion
,
but
it
would
certainly
not
have
be
as
well
for
those
three
who
be
on
one
hearth
in
Lydgate
's
house
at
half
-
past
seven
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
be
prepare
for
Will
's
visit
,
and
she
receive
him
with
a
languid
coldness
which
Lydgate
account
for
by
her
nervous
exhaustion
,
of
which
he
could
not
suppose
that
it
have
any
relation
to
Will
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
sit
in
silence
bend
over
a
bit
of
work
,
he
innocently
apologize
for
her
in
an
indirect
way
by
beg
her
to
lean
backward
and
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
miserable
in
the
necessity
for
play
the
part
of
a
friend
who
be
make
his
first
appearance
and
greeting
to
Rosamond
,
while
his
thought
be
busy
about
her
feeling
since
that
scene
of
yesterday
,
which
seem
still
inexorably
to
enclose
them
both
,
like
the
painful
vision
of
a
double
madness
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
nothing
call
Lydgate
out
of
the
room
;
but
when
Rosamond
pour
out
the
tea
,
and
Will
come
near
to
fetch
it
,
she
place
a
tiny
bit
of
fold
paper
in
his
saucer
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
it
and
secure
it
quickly
,
but
as
he
go
back
to
his
inn
he
have
no
eagerness
to
unfold
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
what
Rosamond
have
write
to
him
would
probably
deepen
the
painful
impression
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
open
and
read
it
by
his
bed
-
candle
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
these
few
word
in
her
neatly
flow
hand
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
under
any
mistake
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
because
she
come
to
see
me
and
be
very
kind
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
nothing
to
reproach
me
with
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
have
make
any
difference
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
these
word
be
not
quite
all
gladness
.
 
<EOS>
as
Will
dwelt
on
them
with
excited
imagination
,
he
feel
his
cheek
and
ear
burn
at
the
thought
of
what
have
occur
between
Dorothea
and
Rosamond
 
at
the
uncertainty
how
far
Dorothea
may
still
feel
her
dignity
wound
in
have
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
offer
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
still
remain
in
her
mind
a
change
association
with
him
which
make
an
irremediable
difference
 
a
lasting
flaw
.
 
<EOS>
with
active
fancy
he
work
himself
into
a
state
of
doubt
<EOS>
little
more
easy
than
that
of
the
man
who
have
escape
from
wreck
by
night
and
stand
on
unknown
ground
in
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
until
that
wretched
yesterday
 
except
the
moment
of
vexation
long
ago
in
the
very
same
room
and
in
the
very
same
presence
 
all
their
vision
,
all
their
thought
of
each
other
,
have
be
as
in
a
world
apart
,
where
the
sunshine
fall
on
tall
white
lily
,
where
no
evil
lurk
,
and
no
other
soul
enter
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
 
would
Dorothea
meet
him
in
that
world
again
?
        
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
now
good
-
morrow
to
our
wake
soul
     
which
watch
not
one
another
out
of
fear
;

<EOS>
on
the
second
morning
after
Dorothea
's
visit
to
Rosamond
,
she
have
have
two
night
of
sound
sleep
,
and
have
not
only
lose
all
trace
of
fatigue
,
but
feel
as
if
she
have
a
great
deal
of
superfluous
strength
 
that
be
to
say
,
more
strength
than
she
could
manage
to
concentrate
on
any
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
before
,
she
have
take
long
walk
outside
the
ground
,
and
have
pay
two
visit
to
the
parsonage
;
but
she
never
in
her
life
tell
any
one
the
reason
why
she
spend
her
time
in
that
fruitless
manner
,
and
this
morning
she
be
rather
angry
with
herself
for
her
childish
restlessness
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
be
to
be
spend
quite
differently
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
be
do
in
the
village
?
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
be
well
and
have
flannel
;
nobody
's
pig
have
die
;
and
it
be
Saturday
morning
,
when
there
be
a
general
scrubbing
of
door
and
door
-
stone
,
and
when
it
be
useless
to
go
into
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
various
subject
that
Dorothea
be
try
to
get
clear
upon
,
and
she
resolve
to
throw
herself
energetically
into
the
gravest
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
down
in
the
library
before
her
particular
little
heap
of
book
on
political
economy
and
kindre
matter
,
out
of
which
she
be
try
to
get
light
as
to
the
good
way
of
spend
money
so
as
not
to
injure
one
's
neighbor
,
or
 
what
come
to
the
same
thing
 
so
as
to
do
them
the
most
good
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
weighty
subject
which
,
if
she
could
but
lay
hold
of
it
,
would
certainly
keep
her
mind
steady
.
 
<EOS>
unhappily
her
mind
slip
off
it
for
a
whole
hour
;
and
at
the
end
she
find
herself
read
sentence
twice
over
with
an
intense
consciousness
of
many
thing
,
but
not
of
any
one
thing
contain
in
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
Should
she
order
the
carriage
and
drive
to
Tipton
?
 
<EOS>
no
;
for
some
reason
or
other
she
prefer
stay
at
Lowick
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
vagrant
mind
must
be
reduce
to
order
<EOS>
:
there
be
an
art
in
self
-
discipline
;
and
she
walk
round
and
round
the
brown
library
consider
by
what
sort
of
manoeuvre
she
could
arrest
her
wander
thought
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
a
mere
task
be
the
good
mean
 
something
to
which
she
must
go
doggedly
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
the
geography
of
Asia
Minor
,
in
which
her
slackness
have
often
be
rebuke
by
Mr.
Casaubon
?
 
<EOS>
She
go
to
the
cabinet
of
map
and
unroll
one
:
<EOS>
this
morning
she
may
make
herself
finally
sure
that
Paphlagonia
be
not
on
the
Levantine
coast
,
and
fix
her
total
darkness
about
the
Chalybes
firmly
on
the
shore
of
the
Euxine
.
 
<EOS>
a
map
be
a
fine
thing
to
study
when
you
be
dispose
to
think
of
something
else
,
be
make
up
of
name
that
would
turn
into
a
chime
if
you
go
back
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Dorothea
set
earnestly
to
work
,
bend
close
to
her
map
,
and
utter
the
name
in
an
audible
,
subdued
tone
,
which
often
get
into
a
chime
.
<EOS>
She
look
amusingly
girlish
after
all
her
deep
experience
 
nod
her
head
and
mark
the
name
off
on
her
finger
,
with
a
little
pursing
of
her
lip
,
and
now
and
then
break
off
to
put
her
hand
on
each
side
of
her
face
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
why
this
should
end
any
more
than
a
merry
-
go
-
round
;
but
it
be
at
last
interrupt
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
announcement
of
Miss
Noble
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
old
lady
,
whose
bonnet
hardly
reach
Dorothea
's
shoulder
,
be
warmly
welcome
,
but
while
her
hand
be
be
press
she
make
many
of
her
beaver
-
like
noise
,
as
if
she
have
something
difficult
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
sit
down
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
roll
a
chair
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
I
want
for
anything
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
so
glad
if
I
can
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
stay
,
"
say
Miss
Noble
,
put
her
hand
into
her
small
basket
,
and
hold
some
article
inside
it
nervously
;
"
I
have
leave
a
friend
in
the
churchyard
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
lapse
into
her
inarticulate
sound
,
and
unconsciously
draw
forth
the
article
which
she
be
finger
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
tortoise
-
shell
lozenge
-
box
,
and
Dorothea
feel
the
color
mount
to
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
"
continue
the
timid
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
fear
he
have
offend
you
,
and
have
beg
me
to
ask
if
you
will
see
him
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
do
not
answer
on
the
instant
:
it
be
cross
her
mind
that
she
could
not
receive
him
in
this
library
,
where
her
husband
's
prohibition
seem
to
dwell
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
towards
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Could
she
go
out
and
meet
him
in
the
ground
?
 
<EOS>
the
sky
be
heavy
,
and
the
tree
have
begin
to
shiver
as
at
a
coming
storm
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
she
shrink
from
go
out
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
see
him
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
"
say
Miss
Noble
,
pathetically
;
"
else
I
must
go
back
and
say
no
,
and
that
will
hurt
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
will
see
him
,
"
say
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
tell
him
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
else
be
there
to
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
she
long
for
at
that
moment
except
to
see
Will
:
the
possibility
of
see
him
have
thrust
itself
insistently
between
her
and
every
other
object
;
and
yet
she
have
a
throb
excitement
like
an
alarm
upon
her
 
a
sense
that
she
be
do
something
daringly
defiant
for
his
sake
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
little
lady
have
trot
away
on
her
mission
,
Dorothea
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
library
with
her
hand
fall
clasp
before
her
,
make
no
attempt
to
compose
herself
in
an
attitude
of
dignified
unconsciousness
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
be
least
conscious
of
just
then
be
her
own
body
:
she
be
think
of
what
be
likely
to
be
in
Will
's
mind
,
and
of
the
hard
feeling
that
other
have
have
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
any
duty
bind
her
to
hardness
?
 
<EOS>
resistance
to
unjust
dispraise
have
mingle
with
her
feeling
for
him
from
the
very
first
,
and
now
in
the
rebound
of
her
heart
after
her
anguish
the
resistance
be
strong
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
love
him
too
much
it
be
because
he
have
be
use
so
ill
:
"
 
there
be
a
voice
within
her
say
this
to
some
imagine
audience
in
the
library
,
when
the
door
be
open
,
and
she
see
Will
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
move
,
and
he
come
towards
her
with
more
doubt
and
timidity
in
his
face
than
she
have
ever
see
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
which
make
him
afraid
lest
some
look
or
word
of
his
should
condemn
him
to
a
new
distance
from
her
;
and
Dorothea
be
afraid
of
her
_
own
_
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
as
if
there
be
a
spell
upon
her
,
keep
her
motionless
and
hinder
her
from
unclasp
her
hand
,
while
some
intense
,
grave
yearning
be
imprison
within
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
she
do
not
put
out
her
hand
as
usual
,
Will
pause
a
yard
from
her
and
say
with
embarrassment
,
"
I
be
so
grateful
to
you
for
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
you
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
have
no
other
word
at
command
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
her
to
sit
down
,
and
Will
do
not
give
a
cheerful
interpretation
to
this
queenly
way
of
receive
him
;
but
he
go
on
to
say
what
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
think
me
foolish
and
perhaps
wrong
for
come
back
so
soon
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
punish
for
my
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
 
every
one
know
now
 
a
painful
story
about
my
parentage
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
of
it
before
I
go
away
,
and
I
always
mean
to
tell
you
of
it
if
 
if
we
ever
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
movement
in
Dorothea
,
and
she
unclasp
her
hand
,
but
immediately
fold
them
over
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
affair
be
matter
of
gossip
now
,
"
Will
continue
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
know
that
something
connect
with
it
 
something
which
happen
before
I
go
away
,
help
to
bring
me
down
here
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
think
it
excuse
my
coming
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
idea
of
get
Bulstrode
to
apply
some
money
to
a
public
purpose
 
some
money
which
he
have
think
of
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
rather
to
Bulstrode
's
credit
that
he
privately
offer
me
compensation
for
an
old
injury
:
he
offer
to
give
me
a
good
income
to
make
amend
;
but
I
suppose
you
know
the
disagreeable
story
?
<EOS>
"
  
Will
look
doubtfully
at
Dorothea
,
but
his
manner
be
gather
some
of
the
defiant
courage
with
which
he
always
think
of
this
fact
in
his
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
You
know
that
it
must
be
altogether
painful
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
yes
 
I
know
,
"
say
Dorothea
,
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
choose
to
accept
an
income
from
such
a
source

I
be
sure
that
you
would
not
think
well
of
me

if
I
do
so

Will

<EOS>
why
should
he
mind
say
anything
of

sort
to
her
now

She
know
that

avow
his
love
for

off

"
You
act
as
I
should
have
expect
you
to
act

say
Dorothea
,
her
face
brightening
and
her
head
become
a
little
more
erect
on
its
beautiful
stem
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
you
would
let
any
circumstance
of
my
birth
create
a
prejudice
in
you
against
me

though
it
be
sure
to
do
so
in
other

"
say
Will
,
shake
his
head
backward
in
his
old
way
,
and
look
with
a
grave
appeal
into
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
a
new
hardship
it
would
be
a
new
reason

cling

Dorothea

fervidly

"
nothing
could
have
change
me

her
heart
be
swell

it
be
difficult

go
on

she
make
a
great
effort
over
herself
to
say
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
,

think
that
you
be
different

so
good

I
have
believe

be

<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
to
believe
me
better
than
I
be

one

Will

give
way
to
his
own
feeling
in
the
evidence

I
mean

in
my
truth

when
I

you

I
do
not
care

anything

I
think
it

there

nothing

endure

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

you
any

Dorothea
,
put
out
her
hand
;
a
vague
fear
for
him
impel
her
unutterable
affection

<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
and
raise
it
to
his
lip
with
something
like
a
sob

he
stand
with
his
hat

glove
in
the
other
hand

may
have
do
for
the
portrait
of
a
Royalist

still
it
be
difficult
to
loose
the
hand

Dorothea

withdraw
it
in
a
confusion
that
distress
her
,
look

move
away

see
how
dark
the

towards
the
window

yet
speak
and
move
with

a
dim
sense
of
what
she
be
do

Will
follow
her
at
a
little
distance
,
and
lean
against
the
tall
back
of
a
leather
chair
,
on
which
he
venture
now
to
lay
his
hat
and
glove
,
and
free
himself
from
the
intolerable
durance
of
formality
to
which
he
have
be
for
the
first
time
condemn
in
Dorothea
's
presence

<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
he
feel
very
happy
at

moment
lean
on

chair

He
be
not
much
afraid
of
anything
that

may
feel
now

They
stand
silent
,
not
look
at

look
at
the
evergreen
which
be
be
toss
,
and
be
show
the
pale
underside
of
their
leave
against
the
blacken
sky

<EOS>
Will
never
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
a
storm
so
much
:
it
deliver
him
from
the
necessity
of
go
away

little

a
flash

Dorothea

to

what

of

<EOS>
"
that

a

the
sense

vision

a
fatality

apart

be
silent
a
moment

passionately

have
the
comfort

up
for

to

the
terror

hopeless
love

Dorothea
dart
instantaneously
from
the
window
;
Will
follow
her
,
seize
her
hand
with
a
spasmodic
movement
;
and
so
they
stand
,
with
their
hand
clasp
,
like
two
child
,
look
out
on
the
storm
,
while
the
thunder
give
a
tremendous
crack
and
roll
above
them
,
and
the
rain
begin
to
pour
down

then
they
turn
their
face
towards

tremblingly

they
move
apart

the
rain
be
dash
against

pane
as
if
an
angry
spirit
be
within

and
behind
it
be
the
great
swoop

it

those
moment
in

both
the
busy
and

Dorothea
sit
down
on

seat
near
to
her

a
long
low
ottoman
in

middle
of

and
with

fold
over

at

himself
beside

his

on
her

itself
upward
to

They
sit
in

way
without

each

be
full
of
thought

when

up

He

with
his

anger

fitfully

Mrs.

be
strong
on

she
have
it
for
certain
from

have
go
over
to

at

who
have
scent
peerage

propitiate
what
be
just
in

vexation

have
hit
on
a
more
ingenious
mode
of
parry
than
he
be
aware
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
touch
a
motive
of
which
Sir
James
be
ashamed
.
 
<EOS>
the
mass
of
his
feeling
about
Dorothea
's
marriage
to
Ladislaw
be
due
partly
to
excusable
prejudice
,
or
even
justifiable
opinion
,
partly
to
a
jealous
repugnance
hardly
less
in
Ladislaw
's
case
than
in
Casaubon
's
.
<EOS>
He
be
convince
that
the
marriage
be
a
fatal
one
for
Dorothea
.
 
<EOS>
but
amid
that
mass
run
a
vein
of
which
he
be
too
good
and
honorable
a
man
to
like
the
avowal
even
to
himself
:
it
be
undeniable
that
the
union
of
the
two
estate
 
Tipton
and
Freshitt
 
lie
charmingly
within
a
ring
-
fence

profess
the
right
,
but
for
not
be
the
man
he
profess
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
consciousness
that
Bulstrode
be
wither
under
while
he
make
his
preparation
for
depart
from
Middlemarch
,
and
go
to
end
his
stricken
life
in
that
sad
refuge
,
the
indifference
of
new
face
.
<EOS>
the
duteous
merciful
constancy
of
his
wife
have
deliver
him
from
one
dread
,
but
it
could
not
hinder
her
presence
from
be
still
a
tribunal
before
which
he
shrink
from
confession
and
desire
advocacy
.
 
<EOS>
His
equivocation
with
himself
about
the
death
of
Raffles
have
sustain
the
conception
of
an
Omniscience
whom
he
pray
to
,
yet
he
have
a
terror
upon
him
which
would
not
let
him
expose
them
to
judgment
by
a
full
confession
to
his
wife
:
the
act
which
he
have
wash
and
dilute
with
inward
argument
and
motive
,
and
for
which
it
seem
comparatively
easy
to
win
invisible
pardon
 
<EOS>
what
name
would
she
call
them
by
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
should
ever
silently
call
his
act
<EOS>
murder
be
what
he
could
not
bear
.
<EOS>
He
feel
shroud
by
her
doubt
:
he
get
strength
to
face
her
from
the
sense
that
she
could
not
yet
feel
warranted
in
pronounce
that
bad
condemnation
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
some
time
,
perhaps
 
when
he
be
die
 
he
would
tell
her
all
:
in
the
deep
shadow
of
that
time
,
when
she
hold
his
hand
in
the
gathering
darkness
,
she
may
listen
without
recoil
from
his
touch
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
:
but
concealment
have
be
the
habit
of
his
life
,
and
the
impulse
to
confession
have
no
power
against
the
dread
of
a
deep
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
full
of
timid
care
for
his
wife
,
not
only
because
he
deprecate
any
harshness
of
judgment
from
her
,
but
because
he
feel
a
deep
distress
at
the
sight
of
her
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
send
her
daughter
away
to
board
at
a
school
on
the
coast
,
that
this
crisis
may
be
hide
from
them
as
far
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
set
free
by
their
absence
from
the
intolerable
necessity
of
account
for
her
grief
or
of
behold
their
frightened
wonder
,
she
could
live
unconstrainedly
with
the
sorrow
that
be
every
day
streak
her
hair
with
whiteness
and
make
her
eyelid
languid
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
a
few
day
afterwards
,
when

have
return
from
a
visit
to
her

begin
to
speak
to
her

subject

have

<EOS>

I

<EOS>
Walter
say
Mr.
Lydgate
must
leave
the
town
,

his
practice
be
almost
good
for
nothing

and
they
have
very
little
leave

<EOS>
I
would
rather
do
without
something
for
ourselves

to
make
some
amend

my
poor
brother

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bulstrode
do
not
wish
to
go
nearer
to
the
fact
than
in
the
phrase

that

must
understand
her
.

He
have
a
particular

advance
him
the
sum

purpose

<EOS>
here
be
his
letter

"
  
<EOS>
the
letter
seem
to
cut
Mrs.
Bulstrode
severely
.
 
<EOS>
the
mention
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
's
loan
seem
a
reflection
of
that
public
feeling
which
hold
it
a
matter
of
course
that
every
one
would
avoid
a
connection
with
her
husband

<EOS>
She
be
silent
for
some
time

tear
fall
one
after

tremble

she
wipe

would

Mr.

what
he
have
to

the
consolation

his

<EOS>
marriage
,
which
have

bourne

so
many
narrative

be
still
a
great
beginning

it

to
Adam

who
keep

in
Eden

but
have
their
first
little
one
among
the
thorn

thistle
of

It
be
still
the
beginning
of
the
home
epic
 
the
gradual
conquest
or
irremediable
loss
of
that
complete
union
which
make
the
advance
year
a
climax
,
and
age
the
harvest
of
sweet
memory
in
common

<EOS>
some
set
out
,
like
Crusaders
of
old
,
with
a
glorious
equipment
of
hope

enthusiasm

get
break
by

want
patience
with

the

<EOS>
all
who
have
care
for
Fred
Vincy
and
Mary
Garth
will
like
to
know
that
these
two
make
no
such
failure
,
but
achieve
a
solid
mutual
happiness
.
<EOS>
Fred
surprise
his
neighbor
in
various
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
become
rather
distinguished
in
his
side
of
the
county
as
a
theoretic
and
practical
farmer
,
and
produce
a
work
on
the
"
Cultivation
of
Green
Crops
and
the
economy
of
Cattle
-
feeding
"
which
win
him
high
congratulation
at
agricultural
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
in
Middlemarch
admiration
be
more
reserved
:
most
person
there
be
incline
to
believe
that
the
merit
of
Fred
's
authorship
be
due
to
his
wife
,
since
they
have
never
expect
Fred
Vincy
to
write
on
turnip
and
mangel
-
wurzel
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Mary
write
a
little
book
for
her
boy
,
call
"
story
of
Great
Men
,
take
from
Plutarch
,
"
and
have
it
print
and
publish
by
Gripp
&
Co.
,
Middlemarch
,
every
one
in
the
town
be
willing
to
give
the
credit
of
this
work
to
Fred
,
observe
that
he
have
be
to
the
University
,
"
where
the
ancient
be
study
,
"
and
may
have
be
a
clergyman
if
he
have
choose
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
it
be
make
clear
that
Middlemarch
have
never
be
deceive
,
and
that
there
be
no
need
to
praise
anybody
for
write
a
book
,
since
it
be
always
do
by
somebody
else
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
Fred
remain
unswervingly
steady
.
 
<EOS>
some
year
after
his
marriage
he
tell
Mary
that
his
happiness
be
half
owing
to
Farebrother
,
who
give
him
a
strong
pull
-
up
at
the
right
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
he
be
never
again
mislead
by
his
hopefulness
:
the
yield
of
crop
or
the
profit
of
a
cattle
sale
usually
fall
below
his
estimate
;
and
he
be
always
prone
to
believe
that
he
could
make
money
by
the
purchase
of
a
horse
which
turn
out
badly
 
though
this
<EOS>
,
Mary
observe
,
be
of
course
the
fault
of
the
horse
,
not
of
Fred
's
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
He
keep
his
love
of
horsemanship
,
but
he
rarely
allow
himself
a
day
's
hunting
;
and
when
he
do
so
,
it
be
remarkable
that
he
submit
to
be
laugh
at
for
cowardliness
at
the
fence
,
seem
to
see
Mary
and
the
boy
sit
on
the
five
-
bar
gate
,
or
show
their
curly
head
between
hedge
and
ditch
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
three
boy
:
<EOS>
Mary
be
not
discontent
that
she
bring
forth
man
-
child
only
;
and
when
Fred
wish
to
have
a
girl
like
her
,
she
say
,
laughingly
,
"
that
would
be
too
great
a
trial
to
your
mother
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vincy
in
her
decline
year
,
and
in
the
diminished
lustre
of
her
housekeeping
,
be
much
comfort
by
her
perception
that
two
at
least
of
Fred
's
boy
be
real
Vincys
,
and
do
not
"
feature
the
Garths
.
"
<EOS>
but
Mary
secretly
rejoice
that
the
young
of
the
three
be
very
much
what
her
father
must
have
be
when
he
wear
a
round
jacket
,
and
show
a
marvellous
nicety
of
aim
in
play
at
marble
,
or
in
throw
stone
to
bring
down
the
mellow
pear
.
  
<EOS>
Ben
and
Letty
Garth
,
who
be
uncle
and
aunt
before
they
be
well
in
their
teen
,
dispute
much
as
to
whether
nephews
or
niece
be
more
desirable
;
Ben
contend
that
it
be
clear
girl
be
good
for
less
than
boy
,
<EOS>
else
they
would
not
be
always
in
petticoat
,
which
show
how
little
they
be
mean
for
;
whereupon
Letty
,
who
argue
much
from
book
,
get
angry
in
reply
that
God
make
coat
of
skin
for
both
Adam
and
Eve
alike
 
<EOS>
also
it
occur
to
her
that
in
the
East
the
man
too
wear
petticoat
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
latter
argument
,
obscure
the
majesty
of
the
former
,
be
one
too
many
,
for
Ben
answer
contemptuously
,
"
the
more
spooney
they
!
"
and
immediately
appeal
to
his
mother
whether
boy
be
not
well
than
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Garth
pronounce
that
both
be
alike
naughty
,
but
that
boy
be
undoubtedly
strong
,
could
run
faster
,
and
throw
with
more
precision
to
a
great
distance
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
oracular
sentence
Ben
be
well
satisfied
,
not
mind
the
naughtiness
;
but
Letty
take
it
ill
,
her
feeling
of
superiority
be
strong
than
her
muscle
.
  
<EOS>
Fred
never
become
rich
 
<EOS>
his
hopefulness
have
not
lead
him
to
expect
that
;
but
he
gradually
save
enough
to
become
owner
of
the
stock
and
furniture
at
Stone
Court
,
and
the
work
which
Mr.
Garth
put
into
his
hand
carry
him
in
plenty
through
those
"
bad
time
"
which
be
always
present
with
farmer
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
in
her
matronly
day
,
become
as
solid
in
figure
as
her
mother
;
but
,
unlike
her
,
give
the
boy
little
formal
teaching
,
so
that
Mrs.
Garth
be
alarm
lest
they
should
never
be
well
ground
in
grammar
and
geography
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
be
find
quite
forward
enough
when
they
go
to
school
;
perhaps
,
because
they
have
like
nothing
so
well
as
be
with
their
mother
.
 
<EOS>
when
Fred
be
ride
home
on
winter
evening
he
have
a
pleasant
vision
beforehand
of
the
bright
hearth
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
,
and
be
sorry
for
other
man
who
could
not
have
Mary
for
their
wife
;
especially
for
Mr.
Farebrother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
ten
time
worthy
of
you
than
I
be
,
<EOS>
"
Fred
could
now
say
to
her
,
magnanimously
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
he
be
,
"
Mary
answer
;
"
and
for
that
reason
he
could
do
better
without
me

<EOS>
but
you
 
<EOS>
I
shudder
to
think
what
you
would
have
be
 
a
curate
in
debt
for
horse
-
hire
and
cambric
pocket

handkerchiefs

"
  
<EOS>
on
inquiry
it
may
possibly
be
find
that
Fred
and
Mary
still
inhabit
Stone
Court
 
that
the
creep
plant
still
cast
the
foam
of
their
blossom
over
the
fine
stone

wall
into
the
field
where
the
walnut

stand
in
stately

that
on
sunny

the
two
lover

engage
with

may
be
see
in
white

placidity
at

which
Mary
Garth
,
in
the
day
of
old
Peter
Featherstone

have
often
be
order
to
look
out
for
Mr.
Lydgate

<EOS>
Lydgate
's
hair
never
become
white

<EOS>
He
die
when
he
be
only
fifty
,
leave
his
wife
and
child
<EOS>
provide
for
by
a
heavy
insurance
on
his
life

<EOS>
He
have
gain
an
excellent
practice
,
alternate

accord
to
the
season
,
between
London
and
a
Continental
bathing

place

have
write
a
treatise
on
Gout
,
a
disease
which
have
a
good
deal
of
wealth
on
its
side
.
 
<EOS>
His
skill
be
rely
on
by
many
pay
patient
,
but
he
always
regard
himself
as
a
failure
:
he
have
not
do
what
he
once
mean
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
His
acquaintance
think
him
enviable
to
have
so
charm
a
wife
,
and
nothing
happen
to
shake
their
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
never
commit
a
second
compromising
indiscretion
.
 
<EOS>
She
simply
continue
to
be
mild
in
her
temper
,
inflexible
in
her
judgment
,
dispose
to
admonish
her
husband
,
and
able
to
frustrate
him
by
stratagem
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
year
go
on
he
oppose
her
less
and
less
<EOS>
,
whence
Rosamond
conclude
that
he
have
learn
the
value
of
her
opinion
;
on
the
other
hand
,
she
have
a
more
thorough
conviction
of
his
talent
now
that
he
gain
a
good
income
,
and
instead
of
the
threaten
cage
in
Bride
Street
provide
one
all
flower
and
gilding
,
fit
for
the
bird
of
paradise
that
she
resemble

<EOS>
in
brief
,
Lydgate
be
what
be
call
a
successful
man

<EOS>
but
he
die
prematurely
of
diphtheria

and
Rosamond
afterwards
marry
an
elderly

wealthy
physician

who
take
kindly
to
her
four

<EOS>
She
make
a
very
pretty
show
with
her
daughter

drive
out
in
her
carriage
,
and
often
speak
of
her
happiness
as
"
a
reward
"
 
she
do
not
say
for
what
,
but
probably
she
mean
that
it
be
a
reward
for
her
patience
with
Tertius

whose
temper
never
become
faultless
,
and
to
the
last
occasionally
let
slip
a
bitter
speech
which
be
more
memorable
than
the
sign
he
make
of
his
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
call
her
his
basil
plant
;
and
when
she
ask
for
an
explanation
,
say
that
basil
be
a
plant
which
have
flourish
wonderfully
on
a
murdered
man
's
brain
.
 
<EOS>
Rosamond
have
a
placid
but
strong
answer
to
such
speech
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
have
he
choose
her
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
he
have
not
have
Mrs.
Ladislaw
,
whom
he
be
always
praise
and
place
above
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
the
conversation
end
with
the
advantage
on
Rosamond
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
unjust
not
to
tell
,
that
she
never
utter
a
word
in
depreciation
of
Dorothea
,
keep
in
religious
remembrance
the
generosity
which
have
come
to
her
aid
in
the
sharp
crisis
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
Dorothea
herself
have
no
dream
of
be
praise
above
other
woman
,
feel
that
there
be
always
something
well
which
she
may
have
do
,
if
she
have
only
be
well
and
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
she
never
repent
that
she
have
give
up
position
and
fortune
to
marry
Will
Ladislaw
,
and
he
would
have
hold
it
the
great
shame
as
well
as
sorrow
to
him
if
she
have
repent
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
bind
to
each
other
by
a
love
strong
than
any
impulse
which
could
have
mar
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
life
would
have
be
possible
to
Dorothea
which
be
not
fill
with
emotion
,
and
she
have
now
a
life
fill
also
with
a
beneficent
activity
which
she
have
not
the
doubtful
pain
of
discover
and
mark
out
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Will
become
an
ardent
public
man
,
work
well
in
those
time
when
reform
be
begin
with
a
young
hopefulness
of
immediate
good
which
have
be
much
check
in
our
day
,
and
get
at
last
return
to
Parliament
by
a
constituency
who
pay
his
expense
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothea
could
have
like
nothing
better
,
since
wrong
exist
,
than
that
her
husband
should
be
in
the
thick
of
a
struggle
against
them
,
and
that
she
should
give
him
wifely
help
.
 
<EOS>
many
who
know
her
,
think
it
a
pity
that
so
substantive
and
rare
<EOS>
a
creature
should
have
be
absorb
into
the
life
of
another
,
and
be
only
know
in
a
certain
circle
as
a
wife
and
mother
.
<EOS>
but
no
one
state
exactly
what
else
that
be
in
her
power
<EOS>
she
ought
rather
to
have
do
 
not
even
Sir
James
Chettam
,
who
go
no
further
than
the
negative
prescription
that
she
ought
not
to
have
marry
Will
Ladislaw
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
opinion
of
his
do
not
cause
a
lasting
alienation
;
and
the
way
in
which
the
family
be
make
whole
again
be
characteristic
of
all
concern
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
correspond
with
Will
and
Dorothea
;
and
one
morning
when
his
pen
have
be
remarkably
fluent
on
the
prospect
of
Municipal
Reform
,
it
run
off
into
an
invitation
to
the
Grange
,
which
,
once
write
,
could
not
be
do
away
with
at
less
cost
than
the
sacrifice
(
hardly
to
be
conceive
)
of
the
whole
valuable
letter
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
month
of
this
correspondence
Mr.
Brooke
have
continually
,
in
his
talk
with
Sir
James
Chettam
,
be
presuppose
or
hint
that
the
intention
of
cut
off
the
entail
be
still
maintain
;
and
the
day
on
which
his
pen
give
the
dare
invitation
,
he
go
to
Freshitt
expressly
to
intimate
that
he
have
a
strong
sense
than
ever
of
the
reason
for
take
that
energetic
step
as
a
precaution
against
any
mixture
of
low
blood
in
the
heir
of
the
Brookes
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
morning
something
exciting
have
happen
at
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
a
letter
have
come
to
Celia
which
make
her
cry
silently
as
she
read
it
;
and
when
Sir
James
,
unused
to
see
her
in
tear
,
ask
anxiously
what
be
the
matter
,
she
burst
out
in
a
wail
such
as
he
have
never
hear
from
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dorothea
have
a
little
boy
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
let
me
go
and
see
her
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
she
want
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
will
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
baby
 
<EOS>
she
will
do
wrong
thing
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
think
she
would
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
suppose
it
have
be
me
and
little
Arthur
,
and
Dodo
have
be
hinder
from
come
to
see
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
be
less
unkind
,
James
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
,
Celia
!
"
say
Sir
James
,
much
work
upon
,
"
what
do
you
wish
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
anything
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
you
to
town
to
-
morrow
if
you
wish
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
Celia
do
wish
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
after
this
that
Mr.
Brooke
come
,
and
meet
the
Baronet
in
the
ground
,
begin
to
chat
with
him
in
ignorance
of
the
news
,
which
Sir
James
for
some
reason
do
not
care
to
tell
him
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
entail
be
touch
on
in
the
usual
way
,
he
say
,
"
My
dear
sir
,
it
be
not
for
me
to
dictate
to
you
,
but
for
my
part
I
would
let
that
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
let
thing
remain
as
they
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
feel
so
much
surprised
that
he
do
not
at
once
find
out
how
much
he
be
relieve
by
the
sense
that
he
be
not
expect
to
do
anything
in
particular
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
bent
of
Celia
's
heart
,
it
be
inevitable
that
Sir
James
should
consent
to
a
reconciliation
with
Dorothea
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
where
woman
love
each
other
,
man
learn
to
smother
their
mutual
dislike
.
<EOS>
Sir
James
never
like
Ladislaw
,
and
Will
always
prefer
to
have
Sir
James
's
company
mix
with
another
kind
:
they
be
on
a
footing
of
reciprocal
tolerance
which
be
make
quite
easy
only
when
Dorothea
and
Celia
be
present
.
  
<EOS>
It
become
an
understand
thing
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Ladislaw
should
pay
at
least
two
visit
during
the
year
to
the
Grange
,
and
there
come
gradually
a
small
row
of
cousin
at
Freshitt
who
enjoy
play
with
the
two
cousin
visit
Tipton
as
much
as
if
the
blood
of
these
cousin
have
be
less
dubiously
mixed
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brooke
live
to
a
good
old
age
,
and
his
estate
be
inherit
by
Dorothea
's
son
,
who
may
have
represent
Middlemarch
,
but
decline
,
think
that
his
opinion
have
less
chance
of
be
stifle
if
he
remain
out
of
door
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
James
never
cease
to
regard
Dorothea
's
second
marriage
as
a
mistake
;
and
indeed
this
remain
the
tradition
concern
it
in
Middlemarch
,
where
she
be
speak
of
to
a
young
generation
as
a
fine
girl
who
marry
a
sickly
clergyman
,
old
enough
to
be
her
father
,
and
in
little
more
than
a
year
after
his
death
give
up
her
estate
to
marry
his
cousin
 
<EOS>
young
enough
to
have
be
his
son
,
with
no
property
,
and
not
well
-
bear
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
not
see
anything
of
Dorothea
usually
observe
that
she
could
not
have
be
"
a
nice
woman
,
"
else
she
would
not
have
marry
either
the
one
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
those
determine
act
of
her
life
be
not
ideally
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
mixed
result
of
young
and
noble
impulse
struggle
amidst
the
condition
of
an
imperfect
social
state
,
in
which
great
feeling
will
often
take
the
aspect
of
error
,
and
great
faith
<EOS>
the
aspect
of
illusion
.
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
creature
whose
inward
being
be
so
strong
that
it
be
not
greatly
determine
by
what
lie
outside
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
new
Theresa
will
hardly
have
the
opportunity
of
reform
a
conventual
life
,
any
more
than
a
new
Antigone
will
spend
her
heroic
piety
in
dare
all
for
the
sake
of
a
brother
's
burial
:
<EOS>
the
medium
in
which
their
ardent
deed
take
shape
be
forever
go
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
insignificant
people
with
our
daily
word
and
act
<EOS>
be
prepare
the
life
of
many
Dorotheas
,
some
of
which
may
present
a
far
sad
sacrifice
than
that
of
the
Dorothea
whose
story
we
know
.
  
<EOS>
Her
finely
touch
spirit
have
still
its
fine
issue
,
though
they
be
not
widely
visible
.
 
<EOS>
Her
full
nature
,
like
that
river
of
which
Cyrus
break
the
strength
,
spend
itself
in
channel
which
have
no
great
name
on
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
effect
of
her
be
on
those
around
her
be
incalculably
diffusive
:
for
the
grow
good
of
the
world
be
partly
dependent
on
unhistoric
act
;
and
that
thing
be
not
so
ill
with
you
and
me
as
they
may
have
be
<EOS>
,
be
half
owe
to
the
number
who
live
faithfully
a
hide
life
,
and
rest
in
unvisited
tomb
.
