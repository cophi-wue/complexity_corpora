out
two

after
a
lot
of
difficulty
to
bring
in

but
the

Port

a
suspicion
that

<EOS>
since

thing
seem

hum
--
two

eight
drunken

lock
up
,
a
mutiny
on
a

and
now
a
yacht

cast
away
--
a
fairly
decent
list
!
<EOS>
and
yet
some
stay
-
at
-
home
people
complain
that
british
consul
be
only
pay
to
be
ornamental
!
<EOS>
They
should
spend
a
week
here
,
at
Leghorn
,
and
they
would
soon
alter
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
would
,
signore
,
"
respond
the
thin
-
faced
old
fellow
with
a
grin
,
as
he
twist
his
fierce
gray
mustache
.
<EOS>
Francesco
Carducci
be
a
well
-
know
character
in
Leghorn
;
interpreter
to
the
Consulate

and
keeper
of
a
sailor
's
home
,
an
honest
,
good

hearted
,
easy

go
fellow
,
who
for
twenty
year
have
occupy
the
same
position
under
half
a
dozen
different
Consuls
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
,
however
,
there
come
from
the
outer
office
a
long
-
draw
moan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
what
be
that
?

I
enquire

.
 
<EOS>
"
only
a

They
want
to
send
him
back

at
Newcastle

"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
a
case
of
madness
!

"
I
exclaim

"
better
get
Doctor

him

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
My
old
friend
Frank
Hutcheson
,
His
Britannic
Majesty
's
Vice
-
Consul
at
the
port
of
Leghorn
,
be
away
on
leave
in
England
,
his
duty
be
relegate
to
young
Bertram
Cavendish
,
the
pro
-
consul
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
however
,
have
go
down
with
a
bad
touch
of
malaria
which
he
have
pick
up
in
the
deadly
Maremma
,
and
I
,
as
the
only
other
Englishman
in
Leghorn
,
have
be
ask
by
the
Consul
-
General
in
Florence
to
act
as
pro
-
consul
until
Hutcheson
's
return
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
mid
-
July
,
and
the
weather
be
blaze
in
the
glaring
sun
-
blanch
Mediterranean
town
.
<EOS>
if
you
know
Leghorn
,
you
probably
know
the
Consulate
with
its
black
and
yellow
escutcheon
outside
,
a
large
,
handsome
suite
of
huge
,
airy
office
face
the
cathedral
,
and
overlook
the
principal
piazza
,
which
be
as
big
as
Trafalgar
Square
,
and
much
more
picturesque
.
<EOS>
the
legend
paint
upon
the
door
,
"
office
hour
,
10
to
3
,
"
and
the
green
persienne
close
against
the
scorch
sun
give
one
the
idea
of
an
easy
appointment
,
but
such
be
certainly
not
the
case
,
for
a
Consul
's
life
at
a
port
of
discharge
must
necessarily
be
a
very
active
one
,
and
his
duty
never
-
end
.
 
<EOS>
Carducci
have
leave
me
to
the
correspondence
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
and
I
confess
I
be
in
no
mood
to
write
reply
in
that
stifle
heat
,
therefore
I
sit
at
the
Consul
's
big
table
,
smoke
a
cigarette
and
stretch
lazily
in
my
friend
's
chair
,
resolve
to
escape
to
the
cool
of
England
as
soon
as
he
return
in
the
follow
week
.
<EOS>
Italy
be
all
very
well
for
nine
month
in
the
year
,
but
Leghorn
be
no
place
for
the
Englishman
in
mid
-
July
.
<EOS>
My
thought
be
wander
toward
the
English
lake
,
and
a
bit
of
grouse
-
shooting
with
my
uncle
up
in
Scotland
,
when
the
faithful
Francesco
re
-
enter
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
send
the
captain
and
his
madman
away
till
this
afternoon
,
signore
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
english
signore
wait
to
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
give
no
name
,
but
want
to
see
the
Signor
Console
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
show
him
in
,
"
I
say
lazily
,
and
a
few
moment
later
a
tall
,
smartly
-
dress
,
middle
-
aged
Englishman
,
in
a
navy
serge
yacht
suit
,
enter
,
and
bow
,
enquire
whether
I
be
the
British
Consul
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
seat
himself
I
explain
my
position
,
whereupon
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
make
much
out
of
your
clerk
.
<EOS>
He
speak
so
brokenly
,
and
I
do
not
know
a
word
of
italian
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
ought
to
first
introduce
myself
.
<EOS>
My
name
be
Philip
Hornby
,
"
and
he
hand
me
a
card
bear
the
name
with
the
address
"
Woodcroft
Park
,
Somerset
<EOS>
------
<EOS>
Brook
's
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
add
:
"
I
be
cruise
on
board
my
yacht
,
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
last
night
we
unfortunately
go
aground
on
the
Meloria
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
new
captain
whom
I
engage
a
few
month
ago
,
and
he
seem
an
arrant
fool
.
<EOS>
very
fortunately
for
us
a
fishing
-
boat
see
our
plight
and
give
the
alarm
at
port
.
<EOS>
the
Admiral
send
out
two
torpedo
-
boat
and
a
tug
,
and
after
about
three
hour
they
manage
to
get
us
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
now
in
harbor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
the
reason
I
have
call
be
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
and
write
me
a
letter
of
thank
in
Italian
to
the
Admiral
,
and
one
to
the
Captain
of
the
Port
--
polite
letter
that
I
can
copy
and
send
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
reply
,
the
more
interested
in
him
on
account
of
the
curious
suspicion
that
the
port
authority
seem
to
entertain
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
a
gentleman
,
and
after
I
have
be
with
him
ten
minute
I
scout
the
idea
that
he
have
endeavor
to
cast
away
the
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
down
a
couple
of
sheet
of
paper
and
scribble
the
draft
of
two
letter
couch
in
the
most
elegant
phraseology
,
as
be
customary
when
address
italian
officialdom
.
 
<EOS>
"
fortunately
,
I
leave
my
wife
in
England
,
or
she
would
have
be
terribly
frightened
,
"
he
remark
presently
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
nasty
wind
blow
all
night
,
and
the
fool
of
a
captain
seem
to
add
to
our
peril
by
every
order
he
give
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
alone
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
friend
with
me
,
"
be
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
many
of
the
crew
be
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
sixteen
,
all
tell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
English
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
all
.
<EOS>
I
find
French
and
Italians
be
more
sober
than
English
,
and
better
behave
in
port
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
examine
him
critically
as
he
sit
face
me
,
and
the
mere
fact
of
his
desire
to
send
thank
to
the
authority
convince
me
that
he
be
a
well
-
breed
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
be
about
forty
-
five
,
with
a
merry
round
,
good
-
natured
face
,
red
with
the
southern
sun
,
blue
eye
,
and
a
short
fair
beard
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
be
essentially
that
of
a
man
devote
to
open
-
air
sport
,
for
it
be
slightly
furrowed
and
weather
-
beat
as
a
true
yachtsman
's
should
be
.
<EOS>
His
speech
be
refine
and
cultivate
,
and
as
we
chat
he
give
me
the
impression
that
as
an
enthusiastic
lover
of
the
sea
,
he
have
cruise
the
Mediterranean
many
time
from
Gibraltar
up
to
Smyrna
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
never
before
put
into
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
arrange
that
his
captain
should
come
to
me
in
the
afternoon
and
make
a
formal
report
of
the
accident
,
we
go
out
together
across
the
white
sunny
piazza
to
Nasi
's
,
the
well
-
know
pastry
-
cook
's
,
where
it
be
the
habit
of
the
Livornese
to
take
their
ante
-
luncheon
vermouth
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
of
Hornby
,
the
more
I
like
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
chatty
and
witty
,
and
treat
his
accident
as
a
huge
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
here
quite
a
week
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
he
say
as
we
be
take
our
vermouth
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
on
our
way
down
to
the
Greek
Islands
,
as
my
friend
Chater
want
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
the
engineer
say
there
be
something
strain
that
we
must
get
mend
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
the
way
,
"
he
add
,
"
why
do
not
you
dine
with
us
on
board
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
do
.
<EOS>
We
can
give
you
a
few
english
thing
that
may
be
a
change
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
invitation
I
gladly
accept
for
two
reason
.
<EOS>
one
be
because
the
suspicion
of
the
Captain
of
the
Port
have
arouse
my
curiosity
,
and
the
other
be
because
I
have
,
honestly
speak
,
take
a
great
fancy
to
Hornby
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
a
short
,
thickset
Scotsman
from
Dundee
,
with
a
barely
heal
cicatrice
across
his
left
cheek
,
call
at
the
Consulate
at
two
o'clock
and
make
his
report
,
which
appear
to
me
to
be
a
very
lame
one
.
<EOS>
He
strike
me
as
be
unworthy
his
certificate
,
for
he
be
evidently
entirely
out
of
his
bearing
when
the
accident
occur
.
<EOS>
the
owner
and
his
friend
Chater
be
in
their
berth
asleep
,
when
suddenly
he
discover
that
the
vessel
be
make
no
headway
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
in
fact
,
run
upon
the
dangerous
shoal
without
be
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
a
strong
sea
be
run
with
a
stiff
breeze
,
and
although
his
seamanship
be
poor
,
he
be
capable
enough
to
recognize
at
once
that
they
be
in
a
very
perilous
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
fortunate
it
be
not
more
serious
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
add
,
after
tell
me
his
story
,
which
I
write
at
his
dictation
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
Board
of
Trade
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
send
up
signal
of
distress
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
--
never
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
you
know
that
you
may
be
lose
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
with
recur
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
the
canny
Scot
,
whose
name
be
Mackintosh
,
hesitate
a
few
moment
,
then
answered--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
you
see
the
fishing
-
boat
have
sight
us
,
and
we
see
her
turn
back
to
port
to
fetch
help
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
excuse
be
a
neat
one
.
<EOS>
probably
it
be
his
neglect
to
make
signal
of
distress
that
have
arouse
the
suspicion
of
the
Captain
of
the
Port
.
<EOS>
from
first
to
last
the
story
of
the
master
of
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
be
,
I
consider
,
a
very
unsatisfactory
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
long
have
you
be
in
Mr.
Hornby
's
service
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
six
month
,
sir
,
"
be
the
man
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
before
he
engage
me
,
I
be
with
the
Wilsons
,
of
Hull
,
run
up
the
Baltic
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
master
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hold
my
master
's
certificate
these
fifteen
year
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
be
with
the
Bibbys
before
the
Wilsons
,
and
before
that
with
the
General
Steam
.
<EOS>
I
do
eight
year
in
the
Mediterranean
with
them
,
when
I
be
chief
mate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
never
be
into
Leghorn
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
dismiss
the
captain
with
a
distinct
impression
that
he
have
not
tell
me
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
that
cicatrice
do
not
improve
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
his
certificate
on
board
,
he
say
,
but
if
I
wish
he
would
bring
them
to
me
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
an
attempt
have
actually
be
make
to
cast
away
the
yacht
,
and
that
it
have
be
frustrate
by
the
master
of
the
felucca
,
who
have
sight
the
vessel
aground
?
<EOS>
there
certainly
seem
some
mystery
surround
the
circumstance
,
and
my
interest
in
the
yacht
and
its
owner
deepen
each
hour
.
<EOS>
how
,
I
wonder
,
have
the
captain
receive
that
very
ugly
wind
across
the
cheek
?
<EOS>
I
be
half
-
inclined
to
inquire
of
him
,
but
on
reflection
decide
that
it
be
good
to
betray
no
undue
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
when
the
fiery
sun
be
sink
in
its
crimson
glory
,
bathe
the
glassy
sea
with
its
blood
-
red
light
and
cause
the
island
of
Gorgona
and
Capraja
to
loom
forth
a
deep
purple
against
the
distant
horizon
,
I
take
a
cab
along
the
old
sea
-
road
to
the
port
where
,
within
the
inner
harbor
,
I
find
the
_
Lola
_
,
one
of
the
most
magnificent
private
vessel
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Her
dimension
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
paint
dead
white
,
with
shine
brass
everywhere
.
<EOS>
at
the
stern
hang
limply
the
british
flag
,
while
at
the
masthead
the
ensign
of
the
Royal
Yacht
Squadron
.
<EOS>
the
yellow
funnel
emit
no
smoke
,
and
as
she
lie
calmly
in
the
sunset
a
crowd
of
dock
-
lounger
and
crimp
lean
upon
the
parapet
discuss
her
merit
and
wonder
who
could
be
the
rich
Englishman
who
could
afford
to
travel
in
a
small
liner
of
his
own
--
for
her
size
surprise
even
those
italian
dock
-
hand
,
use
as
they
be
to
see
every
kind
of
craft
enter
the
busy
port
.
 
<EOS>
on
step
on
deck
Hornby
,
who
like
myself
wear
a
clean
suit
of
white
linen
as
the
most
sensible
dinner
-
garb
in
a
hot
climate
,
come
forward
to
greet
me
,
and
take
me
along
to
the
stern
where
,
lie
in
a
long
wicker
deck
-
chair
beneath
the
awning
,
be
a
tall
,
dark
-
eyed
,
clean
-
shaven
man
of
about
forty
,
also
dress
in
cool
white
linen
.
<EOS>
His
keen
face
give
one
the
impression
that
he
be
a
barrister
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
Hylton
Chater
--
Mr

<EOS>
Gordon
Gregg
,
"
he
say
,
introduce
us
,
and
then
when
,
as
we
shake
hand
,
the
clean
-
shaven
man
exclaim
,
smile
pleasantly--
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
a
stranger
by
any
mean
to
Hornby
or
myself
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
have
get
a
couple
of
your
book
on
board
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
idea
you
live
out
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
Ardenza
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
three
mile
along
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
both
come
and
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
delighted
,
I
be
sure
,
"
declare
Hornby
.
<EOS>
"
to
eat
ashore
be
quite
a
treat
when
one
have
be
box
up
on
board
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
so
we
will
accept
,
will
not
we
,
Hylton
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
reply
the
other
;
and
then
we
begin
chat
about
the
peril
of
the
previous
night
,
Hornby
tell
me
how
he
have
copy
the
two
letter
of
thank
in
Italian
and
send
them
to
their
respective
address
.
 
<EOS>
"
Phil
blaspheme
like
a
levant
skipper
when
he
copy
those
italian
word
!
"
laugh
Chater
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
make
three
copy
of
each
letter
before
he
could
get
all
the
lingo
in
accordance
with
your
copy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
the
whole
afternoon
at
them
--
confound
them
!
"
declare
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
with
a
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
I
do
not
want
to
make
a
lot
of
error
in
spelling
.
<EOS>
these
Italians
be
so
very
punctilious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
certainly
do
the
right
thing
to
thank
the
Admiral
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
unusual
for
him
to
send
out
torpedo
-
boat
to
help
a
vessel
in
distress
.
<EOS>
that
be
generally
leave
to
the
harbor
tug
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
feel
that
it
be
most
kind
of
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
take
all
the
trouble
to
write
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
a
word
of
italian
,
neither
do
Chater
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
Italians
on
board
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
the
two
sailor
who
row
me
out
be
genoese
,
from
their
accent
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hornby
and
Chater
exchange
glance
--
glance
of
distinct
uneasiness
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
said--
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
useful
for
make
arrangement
and
buy
thing
in
italian
port
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
Spaniard
,
a
Greek
,
and
a
Syrian
,
all
of
whom
act
as
interpreter
in
different
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
make
a
handsome
thing
in
the
way
of
secret
commission
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
to
cruise
in
comfort
one
must
pay
and
be
pleasant
,
"
declare
the
man
with
the
fair
beard
.
<EOS>
"
in
Greece
and
the
levant
they
be
more
rapacious
than
in
Naples
,
and
the
Customs
officer
always
want
squaring
,
otherwise
they
be
for
ever
rummage
and
discover
mare
'
nest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
have
any
trouble
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
do
not
visit
us
,
"
he
say
with
a
smile
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
rub
his
thumb
and
finger
together
,
the
action
of
feel
paper
money
.
 
<EOS>
this
increase
my
surprise
,
for
I
happen
to
know
that
the
Leghorn
Customs
officer
be
not
at
all
give
to
the
acceptance
of
bribe
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
well
watch
by
their
superior
.
<EOS>
if
the
yacht
have
really
escape
a
search
,
then
it
be
a
most
unusual
thing
.
<EOS>
besides
,
what
motive
could
hornby
have
in
elude
the
Customs
visit
?
<EOS>
They
would
,
of
course
,
seal
up
his
wine
and
liquor
,
but
even
if
they
do
,
they
would
leave
him
out
sufficient
for
the
consumption
of
himself
and
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
Philip
Hornby
have
some
strong
motive
in
pay
a
heavy
bribe
to
avoid
the
visit
of
the
_
dogana
_
.
<EOS>
if
he
really
have
pay
,
he
must
have
pay
very
heavily
;
of
that
I
be
convince
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
some
mystery
be
hide
on
board
that
splendidly
appoint
craft
?
 
<EOS>
presently
the
gong
sound
,
and
we
go
below
into
the
elegantly
fit
saloon
,
where
be
spread
a
table
that
sparkle
with
cut
glass
and
shone
with
silver
.
<EOS>
around
the
center
fresh
flower
have
be
trail
by
some
artistic
hand
,
while
on
the
buffet
at
the
end
the
neck
of
wine
bottle
peer
out
from
the
ice
pail
.
<EOS>
both
carpet
and
upholstery
be
in
pale
blue
,
while
everywhere
it
be
apparent
that
none
but
an
extremely
wealthy
man
could
afford
such
a
magnificent
craft
.
 
<EOS>
Hornby
take
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
we
sit
on
either
side
of
him
,
chat
merrily
while
we
eat
one
of
the
choice
and
best
cooked
dinner
it
have
ever
be
my
lot
to
taste
.
<EOS>
chater
and
I
drink
wine
of
a
brand
which
only
a
millionaire
could
keep
in
his
cellar
,
while
our
host
,
apparently
a
most
abstemious
man
,
take
only
a
glass
of
iced
Cinciano
water
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
smart
steward
serve
in
a
manner
which
show
them
to
be
well
train
to
their
duty
,
and
as
the
evening
light
filter
through
the
pale
blue
silk
curtain
over
the
open
port
-
hole
slowly
fade
,
we
gossip
on
as
man
will
gossip
over
an
unusually
good
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
from
his
remark
I
discern
that
,
contrary
to
my
first
impression
,
Hylton
Chater
be
an
experienced
yachtsman
.
<EOS>
He
own
a
craft
call
the
_
Alicia
_
,
and
be
a
member
of
the
Cork
Yacht
Club
.
<EOS>
He
live
in
London
,
he
tell
me
,
but
give
me
no
information
as
to
his
profession
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
the
law
,
as
I
have
surmise
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
see
our
ass
of
a
captain
,
Mr.
Gregg
?
<EOS>
"
he
remark
presently
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
rather
hesitatingly
,
"
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
not
think
very
much
of
his
seamanship
--
nor
will
the
Board
of
Trade
when
his
report
reach
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
exclaim
Hornby
,
"
I
be
a
fool
to
engage
him
.
<EOS>
from
the
very
first
I
mistrust
him
,
only
my
wife
somehow
take
a
fancy
to
the
fellow
,
and
,
as
you
know
,
if
you
want
peace
you
must
always
please
the
woman
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
however
,
her
choice
almost
cost
me
the
vessel
,
and
perhaps
our
life
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
nothing
of
him
previously
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
engage
the
crew
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
they
all
fresh
hand
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
except
the
cook
and
the
two
steward
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
silent
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
entertain
a
distinct
suspicion
of
both
master
and
crew
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
captain
seem
to
have
have
a
nasty
cut
across
the
cheek
,
"
I
remark
,
whereupon
my
two
companion
again
exchange
quick
,
apprehensive
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
fall
down
the
other
day
,
"
explain
Chater
,
with
a
rather
sickly
smile
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
His
face
catch
the
edge
of
an
iron
stair
in
the
engine
-
room
,
and
cause
a
nasty
gash
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
smile
within
myself
,
for
I
know
too
well
that
the
ugly
wound
in
the
captain
's
face
have
never
be
inflict
by
fall
on
the
edge
of
a
stair
.
<EOS>
but
I
remain
silent
,
be
content
that
they
should
endeavor
to
mislead
me
.
 
<EOS>
after
dessert
have
be
serve
we
rise
,
and
in
the
summer
twilight
,
when
all
the
port
be
open
,
Hornby
take
me
over
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
everywhere
be
abundant
luxury
--
a
veritable
float
palace
.
<EOS>
to
each
of
the
cabin
of
the
owner
and
his
guest
a
bathroom
be
attach
with
sea
-
water
or
fresh
water
as
desire
,
while
the
lady
'
saloon
,
the
boudoir
,
the
library
,
and
the
smoking
-
room
be
furnish
richly
with
exquisite
taste
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
conduct
me
from
his
own
cabin
to
the
boudoir
we
pass
a
door
that
have
be
blow
open
by
the
wind
,
and
which
he
hasten
to
close
,
not
,
however
,
before
I
have
time
to
glance
within
.
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
I
discover
that
it
be
an
armory
cram
with
rifle
,
revolver
and
ammunition
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
intend
that
I
should
see
that
interior
,
and
the
reason
why
the
Customs
officer
have
be
bribe
be
now
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
on
without
remark
,
make
believe
that
I
have
not
discern
anything
unusual
,
and
we
enter
the
boudoir
,
Chater
have
go
back
to
the
saloon
to
obtain
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
the
dainty
little
chamber
be
upholster
in
carnation
-
pink
silk
with
furniture
of
inlaid
rosewood
,
and
bear
everywhere
the
trace
of
have
be
arrange
by
a
woman
's
hand
,
although
no
lady
passenger
be
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
we
have
enter
,
and
I
be
admire
the
dainty
nest
of
luxury
<EOS>
,
Chater
shout
to
his
host
ask
for
the
key
of
the
cigar
cupboard
,
and
Hornby
,
excuse
himself
,
turn
back
along
the
gangway
to
hand
them
to
his
friend
,
thus
leave
me
alone
for
a
few
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
glance
around
,
and
as
I
do
so
my
eye
fall
upon
a
quantity
of
photograph
,
framed
and
unframed
,
that
be
scatter
about
--
<EOS>
evidently
portrait
of
Hornby
's
friend
.
<EOS>
upon
a
small
side
table
,
however
,
stand
a
heavy
oxidize
silver
frame
,
but
empty
,
while
lie
on
the
floor
beneath
a
couch
be
the
photograph
it
have
contain
,
which
have
apparently
be
take
hastily
out
,
tear
first
in
half
and
then
in
half
again
,
and
cast
away
.
 
<EOS>
Curiosity
prompt
me
to
stoop
,
pick
up
the
four
piece
and
place
them
together
,
when
I
find
them
to
form
the
cabinet
portrait
of
a
sweet
-
looking
and
extremely
pretty
english
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
,
with
a
bright
,
smile
expression
,
and
wear
a
fresh
morning
blouse
of
white
pique
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
dress
low
and
fasten
with
a
bow
of
black
ribbon
,
while
the
brooch
at
her
throat
be
in
the
form
of
a
heart
edge
with
pearl
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
her
sweet
expression
,
or
whether
the
curious
look
in
her
eye
have
attract
my
attention
and
rivet
the
face
upon
my
memory
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
the
mystery
of
why
it
should
have
be
so
hastily
tear
from
its
frame
and
destroy
that
hold
my
attention
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
it
have
be
tear
up
surreptitiously
by
someone
who
have
be
sit
on
that
couch
,
and
who
have
have
no
opportunity
of
cast
the
fragment
away
through
the
port
-
hole
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
back
of
the
tear
photograph
,
and
see
that
it
have
be
take
by
a
well
-
know
and
fashionable
firm
in
New
Bond
Street
.
 
<EOS>
about
the
expression
of
that
picture
face
be
something
which
I
can
not
describe
--
a
curious
look
in
the
eye
which
be
at
the
same
time
both
attractive
and
mysterious
.
<EOS>
in
that
brief
moment
the
girl
's
feature
be
indelibly
impress
upon
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
next
second
,
however
,
hear
Hornby
's
return
footstep
,
I
fling
the
fragment
hastily
beneath
the
couch
where
I
have
discover
them
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
wonder
,
have
the
picture
be
destroy
--
and
by
whom
?
 
<EOS>
the
face
of
the
empty
frame
have
be
purposely
turn
towards
the
panelling
,
therefore
when
he
enter
he
do
not
notice
that
the
picture
have
be
destroy
;
but
after
a
brief
pause
,
explain
that
that
cosy
little
place
be
his
wife
's
particular
nook
,
he
conduct
me
on
through
the
lady
'
saloon
and
afterwards
on
deck
,
where
we
fling
ourselves
into
the
long
chair
,
take
our
coffee
and
certosina
,
that
liqueur
essentially
tuscan
,
and
smoke
on
as
the
moon
rise
and
the
light
of
the
harbor
begin
to
twinkle
in
the
steely
night
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
sit
talk
,
my
thought
run
back
to
that
tear
photograph
.
<EOS>
to
me
it
seem
as
though
some
previous
visitor
that
day
have
sit
upon
the
couch
,
destroy
the
picture
,
and
cast
it
where
I
have
find
it
.
<EOS>
but
for
what
reason
?
<EOS>
who
be
the
merry
-
faced
girl
whose
picture
have
arouse
such
jealousy
or
revenge
?
 
<EOS>
I
purposely
lead
the
conversation
to
Hornby
's
family
,
and
learn
from
him
that
he
have
no
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
the
repair
to
your
engine
do
at
Orlando
's
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
,
name
the
great
shipbuilding
firm
of
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
give
the
order
.
<EOS>
They
be
contract
to
be
finish
by
next
Thursday
,
and
then
we
shall
be
off
to
Zante
and
Chio
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
what
reason
,
I
wonder
,
recollect
that
formidable
armory
on
board
.
<EOS>
already
I
have
see
quite
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
the
_
Lola
_
,
although
outwardly
a
pleasure
yacht
,
be
build
of
steel
,
armor
in
its
most
vulnerable
part
,
and
capable
of
resist
a
very
sharp
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
hour
pass
,
and
beneath
the
brilliant
moon
we
smoke
long
into
the
night
,
for
after
the
blaze
sunshine
of
that
tuscan
town
the
cool
sea
-
wind
at
night
be
very
refreshing
.
<EOS>
from
where
we
sit
we
command
a
view
of
the
whole
of
the
sea
-
front
of
Leghorn
and
Ardenza
,
with
its
bright
open
-
air
cafe
-
concert
and
restaurant
in
full
swing
--
all
the
life
and
gayety
of
that
popular
watering
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
when
Hornby
have
rise
to
call
a
steward
and
leave
me
alone
with
Hylton
Chater
,
the
latter
whisper
to
me
in
confidence--
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
find
my
friend
Hornby
a
little
bit
strange
in
his
manner
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
you
must
take
no
notice
.
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
be
a
man
who
have
become
suddenly
wealthy
beyond
the
wildest
dream
of
avarice
,
and
I
fear
it
have
have
an
effect
upon
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
do
very
queer
thing
at
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
companion
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
be
either
tell
the
truth
,
or
else
he
be
endeavor
to
allay
my
suspicion
by
an
extremely
clever
ruse
.
<EOS>
now
I
have
already
decide
that
Philip
Hornby
be
no
eccentric
,
but
a
particularly
level
-
head
and
practical
man
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
instantly
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
clean
-
shave
fellow
who
look
so
much
like
a
London
barrister
have
some
distinct
and
ulterior
purpose
in
arouse
within
my
mind
suspicion
of
his
host
's
sanity
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
past
midnight
when
,
have
bade
the
strange
pair
adieu
,
I
be
put
ashore
by
the
two
sailor
who
have
row
me
out
and
drive
home
along
the
sea
-
front
,
puzzle
and
perplex
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
,
on
my
arrival
at
the
Consulate
,
old
Francesco
,
who
have
enter
only
a
moment
before
,
meet
me
with
blanched
face
,
gasping--
 
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
thief
here
in
the
night
,
signore
!
<EOS>
the
Signor
Console
's
safe
have
be
open
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
safe
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cry
,
dash
into
Hutcheson
's
private
room
,
and
find
to
my
dismay
the
big
safe
,
wherein
the
seal
,
cipher
and
other
confidential
document
be
keep
,
stand
open
,
and
the
content
in
disorder
,
as
though
a
hasty
search
have
be
make
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
the
thief
have
be
after
the
Admiralty
and
Foreign
Office
cipher
,
copy
of
which
the
Chancelleries
of
certain
european
Powers
be
ever
endeavor
to
obtain
?
<EOS>
I
smile
within
myself
when
I
realize
how
bitterly
disappoint
the
burglar
must
have
be
,
for
a
British
Consul
when
he
go
on
leave
to
England
<EOS>
always
take
his
cipher
with
him
,
and
deposit
them
at
the
Foreign
Office
for
safekeepe
.
<EOS>
Hutcheson
have
,
of
course
,
take
his
,
accord
to
the
regulation
.
 
<EOS>
curiously
enough
,
however
,
the
door
of
the
Consulate
and
the
safe
have
be
open
with
the
key
which
my
friend
have
leave
in
my
charge
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
small
bunch
still
remain
in
the
safe
door
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
the
recollection
flash
across
my
mind
that
I
have
feel
the
key
in
my
pocket
while
at
dinner
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
have
I
lose
them
on
my
homeward
drive
,
or
have
my
pocket
be
pick
?
 
<EOS>
Carducci
,
with
an
Italian
's
volubility
,
commence
to
hurl
imprecation
upon
the
head
of
the
unknown
son
of
dog
who
dare
to
tamper
with
his
master
's
safe
,
and
while
we
be
engage
in
put
the
scatter
paper
in
order
the
door
-
bell
rang
,
and
the
clerk
go
to
attend
to
the
caller
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
he
return
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
the
english
yacht
leave
suddenly
last
night
,
signore
,
and
the
captain
of
the
Port
have
send
to
inquire
whether
you
know
to
what
port
she
be
bind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
left
!
"
<EOS>
I
gasp
in
amazement
"
<EOS>
why
,
I
think
her
engine
be
disabled
!
"
 
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
I
be
sit
in
the
private
office
of
the
shrewd
,
gray
-
haired
functionary
who
have
send
this
messenger
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
"
he
say
,
"
some
mystery
surround
that
vessel
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
,
for
yesterday
we
telegraph
to
Lloyd
's
,
in
London
,
and
this
morning
I
receive
a
reply
that
no
such
yacht
appear
on
their
register
,
and
that
the
name
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
the
police
have
also
telegraph
to
your
english
police
inquire
about
the
owner
,
Signor
Hornby
,
with
a
like
result
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
place
as
Woodcroft
Park
,
in
Somerset
,
and
no
member
of
Brook
's
Club
of
the
name
of
Hornby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
sit
stare
at
the
official
,
too
amazed
to
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
certainly
they
have
not
allow
the
grass
to
grow
beneath
their
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
unfortunately
the
telegraphic
reply
from
England
be
only
to
hand
this
morning
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
because
just
before
two
o'clock
this
morning
the
harbor
police
,
whom
I
specially
order
to
watch
the
vessel
,
see
a
boat
come
to
the
wharf
contain
a
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
the
pair
be
put
ashore
,
and
walk
away
into
the
town
,
the
woman
seem
to
walk
with
considerable
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
boat
return
,
and
an
hour
after
,
to
the
complete
surprise
of
the
two
detective
,
steam
be
suddenly
get
up
and
the
yacht
turn
and
go
straight
out
to
sea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
the
man
and
the
woman
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
them
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
They
be
probably
still
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
police
be
now
search
for
trace
of
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
could
not
you
have
detain
the
vessel
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
have
I
but
know
<EOS>
I
could
have
forbid
her
departure
.
<EOS>
but
as
her
owner
have
present
himself
at
the
Consulate
,
and
be
recognize
as
a
respectable
person
,
I
feel
that
I
could
not
interfere
without
some
tangible
information
--
and
that
,
alas
!
<EOS>
have
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
the
vessel
be
a
swift
one
,
and
have
already
seven
hour
start
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
ask
the
Admiral
to
send
out
a
couple
of
torpedo
-
boat
after
her
,
but
,
unfortunately
,
this
be
impossible
,
as
the
flotilla
be
sail
in
an
hour
to
attend
the
naval
review
at
Spezia
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
the
Consul
's
safe
have
be
open
during
the
night
,
and
he
sit
listen
with
wide
-
open
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
dine
with
them
last
night
,
"
he
say
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
They
may
have
surreptitiously
steal
your
key
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
may
,
"
be
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
probably
they
do
.
<EOS>
but
with
what
motive
?
"
 
the
Captain
of
the
Port
elevate
his
shoulder
,
exhibit
his
palm
,
and
declared--
 
<EOS>
"
the
whole
affair
from
begin
to
end
be
a
complete
and
profound
mystery
.
"
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
ii
 
<EOS>
why
the
SAFE
be
OPENED
  
<EOS>
that
day
be
an
active
one
in
Questura
,
or
police
office
,
of
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
detective
call
,
examine
the
safe
,
and
sagely
declare
it
to
be
burglar
-
proof
,
have
not
the
thief
possess
the
key
.
<EOS>
the
Foreign
Office
know
that
,
for
they
supply
all
the
safe
to
the
Consulates
abroad
,
in
order
that
the
precious
cipher
shall
be
keep
from
the
pry
eye
of
foreign
spy
.
<EOS>
the
Questore
,
or
chief
of
police
,
be
of
opinion
that
it
be
the
cipher
of
which
the
thief
have
be
in
search
,
and
be
much
relieved
to
hear
that
they
be
in
safekeepe
far
away
in
Downing
Street
.
 
<EOS>
His
conjecture
be
the
same
as
my
own
,
namely
,
that
the
reason
of
Hornby
's
call
upon
me
be
to
ascertain
the
situation
of
the
Consulate
and
the
whereabouts
of
the
safe
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
stand
in
a
corner
of
the
Consul
's
private
room
.
<EOS>
Captain
Mackintosh
,
too
,
have
take
his
bearing
,
and
probably
while
I
sit
at
dinner
on
board
<EOS>
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
my
key
have
be
steal
and
pass
on
to
the
scar
Scotsman
,
who
have
promptly
go
ashore
and
ransack
the
place
while
I
have
remain
with
his
master
smoking
and
unsuspicious
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
motive
?
<EOS>
why
have
they
ransack
all
those
confidential
paper
?
 
<EOS>
My
own
idea
be
that
they
be
not
in
search
of
the
cipher
at
all
,
but
either
want
some
blank
form
or
other
,
or
else
they
desire
to
make
use
of
the
consular
seal
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
however
,
still
remain
on
the
floor
near
the
safe
,
as
though
it
have
roll
out
and
be
leave
unheeded
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
Francesco
and
I
could
ascertain
,
nothing
whatever
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
we
re
-
arrange
the
paper
,
re
-
lock
the
safe
and
resolve
not
to
telegraph
to
Hutcheson
and
unduly
disturb
him
,
as
in
a
few
day
he
would
return
from
England
,
and
there
would
be
time
enough
then
to
explain
the
remarkable
story
.
 
<EOS>
one
fact
,
however
,
we
establish
.
<EOS>
the
detective
on
duty
at
the
railway
station
distinctly
recollect
a
thin
middle
-
aged
man
,
accompany
by
a
lady
in
deep
black
,
pass
the
barrier
and
enter
the
train
which
leave
at
three
o'clock
for
Colle
Salvetti
to
join
the
Rome
express
.
<EOS>
They
be
foreigner
,
therefore
he
do
not
take
the
same
notice
of
them
as
though
they
have
be
Italians
.
<EOS>
inquiry
at
the
booking
-
office
show
,
however
,
that
no
passenger
have
book
direct
to
Rome
by
the
train
in
question
.
<EOS>
to
Grossetto
,
Cecina
,
Campiglia
,
and
the
other
place
in
the
Maremma
,
passenger
have
take
ticket
,
but
not
one
have
be
book
to
any
of
the
great
town
.
<EOS>
therefore
it
be
apparent
that
the
mysterious
pair
who
have
come
ashore
just
prior
to
the
sailing
of
the
yacht
have
merely
take
ticket
for
a
false
destination
,
and
have
re
-
book
at
Colle
Salvetti
,
the
junction
with
that
long
main
line
which
connect
Genoa
with
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
the
police
be
puzzle
.
<EOS>
the
two
fisherman
who
sight
the
_
Lola
_
and
first
give
the
alarm
of
her
danger
,
declare
that
when
they
draw
alongside
and
proffer
assistance
the
captain
threaten
to
shoot
the
first
man
who
come
aboard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
English
!
"
<EOS>
remark
the
sturdy
,
brown
-
face
toiler
of
the
sea
,
grin
knowingly
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
English
,
when
they
drink
their
cognac
,
know
not
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
get
any
reward
for
return
to
harbor
and
report
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reward
!
"
echo
one
of
the
man
,
the
elder
of
the
pair
.
<EOS>
"
not
a
soldo
!
<EOS>
the
English
only
curse
us
for
interfere
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
we
believe
that
they
be
try
to
make
away
with
the
vessel
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
description
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
its
owner
,
his
guest
,
and
the
captain
be
circulate
by
the
police
to
all
the
Mediterranean
port
,
with
a
request
that
the
yacht
should
be
detain
.
<EOS>
yet
if
the
vessel
be
really
one
of
mystery
,
as
it
seem
to
be
,
its
owner
would
no
doubt
go
across
to
some
quiet
anchorage
on
the
Algerian
coast
out
of
the
track
of
the
vessel
,
and
calmly
proceed
to
repaint
,
rename
and
disguise
his
craft
so
that
it
would
not
be
recognize
in
Marseilles
,
Naples
,
Smyrna
,
or
any
of
the
port
where
private
yacht
habitually
call
.
<EOS>
thus
,
from
the
very
first
,
it
seem
to
me
that
Hornby
and
his
friend
have
very
cleverly
trick
me
for
some
mysterious
purpose
,
and
afterwards
ingeniously
evade
their
watcher
and
get
clean
away
.
 
<EOS>
have
the
Italian
Admiral
be
able
to
send
a
torpedo
-
boat
or
two
after
the
fugitive
they
would
no
doubt
soon
have
be
overhaul
,
yet
circumstance
have
prevent
this
and
<EOS>
the
_
Lola

have
consequently
escape
.
 
<EOS>
for
purpose
of
their
own
the
police
keep
the
affair
out
of
the
paper
,
and
when
Frank
Hutcheson
step
out
of
the
sleep
-
car
from
Paris
on
to
the
platform
at
Pisa
a
few
night
afterwards
,
I
relate
to
him
the
extraordinary
story
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
scoundrel
want
these
,
that
be
evident
,
"
he
respond
,
hold
up
the
small
,
strong
,
leather
hand

bag
he
be
carry
,
and
which
contain
his
jealously

guard
cipher
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
Jove
!
"
he
laugh
,
"
how
disappointed
they
must
have
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
I
say
,
as
we
enter
the
midnight
train
for
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
"
but
my
own
theory
be
that
they
be
search
for
some
paper
or
other
that
you
possess
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
my
paper
concern
them
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
jovial
,
round
-
faced
Consul
,
a
man
whose
courtesy
be
know
to
every
skipper
trade
up
and
down
the
Mediterranean
,
and
who
be
perhaps
one
of
the
most
cultured
and
popular
man
in
the
British
Consular
Service
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
keep
bank
note
in
that
safe
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
We
fellow
in
the
Service
do
not
roll
in
gold
as
our
public
at
home
appear
to
think
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
have
something
in
there
which
may
be
of
value
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
be
often
the
keeper
of
valuable
document
belong
to
Englishmen
abroad
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
in
there
just
now
except
,
perhaps
,
the
register
of
birth
,
marriage
and
death
of
british
subject
,
and
the
paper
concern
a
Board
of
Trade
inquiry
.
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Gordon
,
depend
upon
it
that
the
yacht
run
ashore
be
all
a
blind
.
<EOS>
They
do
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
the
run
of
the
Consulate
,
secure
the
cipher
,
and
sail
merrily
away
with
them
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
,
however
,
that
they
give
you
a
jolly
good
dinner
and
get
nothing
in
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
may
very
easily
have
carry
me
off
too
,
"
I
declare
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
would
have
be
well
if
they
have
.
<EOS>
You
would
at
least
have
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
what
their
little
game
really
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
man
and
the
woman
who
leave
the
yacht
an
hour
before
she
sail
,
and
who
slip
away
into
the
country
somewhere
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
they
be
?
<EOS>
Hornby
distinctly
tell
me
that
he
and
Chater
be
alone
,
and
yet
there
be
evidently
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
on
board
.
<EOS>
I
guess
there
be
a
woman
there
,
from
the
way
the
boudoir
and
lady
'
saloon
be
arrange
,
and
certainly
no
man
's
hand
decorate
a
dinner
table
as
that
be
decorate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
that
be
decidedly
funny
,
"
remark
the
Consul
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
They
go
to
Colle
Salvetti
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
They
change
there
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
express
call
there
,
one
go
north
and
the
other
south
,
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
train
arrive
from
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
They
show
a
lot
of
ingenuity
,
otherwise
they
would
have
go
direct
to
Pisa
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ingenuity
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
!
<EOS>
the
whole
affair
be
most
cleverly
plan
.
<EOS>
hornby
would
have
deceive
even
you
,
my
dear
old
chap
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
air
of
the
perfect
gentleman
,
and
a
glance
over
the
yacht
convince
me
that
he
be
a
wealthy
man
travel
for
pleasure
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
something
about
an
armory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
be
<EOS>
Maxims
stow
away
in
one
of
the
cabin

<EOS>
They
arouse
my
suspicion

They
would
not

arouse
mine
,

reply
my

yacht
carry

for
protection
in

case

if

go
to

along
uncivilized
coast

"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
of
the
tear
photograph
,
which
cause
him
some
deep
reflection

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
why
the
picture
have
be
tear
up

<EOS>
have
there
be
a
row
on
board
--
a
quarrel
or
something
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
destroy
surreptitiously

I
think
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
pity
you
do
not
pocket
the
fragment

<EOS>
We
could
perhaps
have
discover
from
the
photographer
the
identity
of
the
original
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
sigh
regretfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
the
name
of
the
firm

however
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
report
to
London
the
whole
occurrence

as
british

under
suspicion

Hutcheson
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
whether
Scotland
Yard
know
anything
about
Hornby
or
Chater
.
<EOS>
most
probably
they
do
.
<EOS>
not
long
ago
a
description
of
man
on
board
a
yacht
be
circulate
from
London
as
be
a
pair
of
well
-
know
burglar
who
be
cruise
about
in
a
vessel
cram
with
booty
which
they
dare
not
get
rid
of
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
however
,
not
the
same
as
our
friend
on
the
_
Lola
_
,
for
both
man
want
be
arrest
in
New
Orleans
about
eight
month
ago
,
without
their
yacht

for
they
confess
that
they
have
deliberately
sink
it
on
one
of
the
island
in
the
South
Pacific

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
these
fellow
may
be
another
pair
of
London
burglar
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
eagerly
,
as
the
startling
theory
occur
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
may
be
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
we
can
not
form
any
opinion
until
we
hear
what
Scotland
Yard
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
a
full
report
in
the
morning
if
you
will
give
me
minute
description
of
the
man
,
as
well
as
of
the
captain
,
Mackintosh
.
"
 
<EOS>
next
morning
I
hand
over
my
charge
of
the
Consulate
to
Frank
,
and
then
assist
him
to
go
through
the
paper
in
the
safe
which
have
be
examine
by
the
thief
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
ruffian
seem
to
have
thoroughly
overhaul
everything
,
"
remark
the
Consul
in
dismay
when
he
see
the
disorder
state
of
his
paper
.
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
have
read
every
one
deliberately
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
which
show
that
have
they
be
in
search
for
the
cipher

book
they
would
only
have
look
for
them
alone

"
I
remark
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
could
interest
them
in
all
these
dry
,
unimportant
shipping
report
and
thing
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
goodness
only
know
,
"
reply
my
friend
.
<EOS>
then
,
call
Cavendish
,
a
tall
,
fair
young
man
,
who
have
now
recover
from
his
touch
of
fever
and
have
return
to
the
Consulate
,
he
commence
to
check
the
number
of
those
adhesive
stamp
,
rather
large
than
ordinary
postage
-
stamp
,
use
in
the
Consular
service
for
the
registration
of
fee
receive
by
the
Foreign
Office
.
<EOS>
the
value
be
from
sixpence
to
one
pound
,
and
they
be
keep
in
a
portfolio
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
long
calculation
the
Consul
suddenly
raise
his
face
to
me
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
then
six
ten
shill
one
have
be
take
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
motive
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
of
no
use
to
anyone
except
to
Consuls
,
"
he
explain
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
they
be
want
to
affix
to
some
false
certificate
.
<EOS>
see
,
"
he
add
,
open
the
portfolio
,
"
there
be
six
stamp
here
,
and
all
be
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
they
would
have
to
be
obliterate
by
the
Consular
stamp

"
remark
Cavendish
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
of
course
,
"
exclaim
Hutcheson
,
take
out
the
brass
seal
from
the
safe
and
examine
it
minutely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
Jove
!
"
he
cry
a
second
later
,
"
it
be
be
use
!
<EOS>
They
have
stamp
some
document
with
it
.
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
They
have
use
the
wrong
ink
-
pad
!
<EOS>
can
not
you
see
that
there
be
violet
upon
it
,
while
we
always
use
the
black
pad
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
in
my
hand
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
I
see
trace
of
violet
ink
upon
it
--
the
ink
of
the
pad
for
the
date
-
stamp
upon
the
Consul
's
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
some
document
have
be
stamp
and
seal
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
and
my
signature
forge
to
it
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
They
have
fabricate
some
certificate
or
other
which
,
bear
the
stamp
,
seal
and
signature
of
the
Consulate
,
will
be
accept
as
a
legal
document

<EOS>
I
wonder
what
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
three
of
us
look
at
each
other
in
sheer
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
reason
the
paper
be
all
upset
be
because
they
be
evidently
in
search
of
some
blank
form
or
other
,
which
they
hope
to
find
,
"
remark
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
as
you
say
,
the
whole
affair
be
most
carefully
and
ingeniously
plan

<EOS>
We
cross
the
great
sunlit
piazza
together
and
enter
the
Questura
,
that
sun
-
blanch
old
palace
with
its
long
cool
loggia
where
the
sentry
pace
day
and
night

<EOS>
the
Chief
of
Police
,
whom
we
see
,
have
no
further
information

<EOS>
the
mysterious
yacht
have
not
put
in
at
any
italian
port

<EOS>
from
him
,
however
,
we
learn
the
name
of
the
detective
who
have
see
the
two
stranger
leave
Leghorn
by
the
early
morning
train
,
and
an
hour
afterwards
the
police

officer

black
-
eyed
man
short
of
stature
,

of
an
intelligent
type

sit
in

to
our
question

as
far
as
I

next

the

Europe
for
a

at
home
if

<EOS>
It
be
generally
reckon
that
such
a
trip
cost
about
two
pound
an
hour
while
in
London

<EOS>
and
yet
when
a

whole

his

loll
back

away
at

he
stammer

He
pause
a
moment
,
and
I
could
see
what
a
strenuous
effort
he
be
make
to
avoid
betray
knowledge

it's

well--

hesitatingly

with
a
rather
sickly

he
say
in
a
hard
tone
,
stride
across
the
deck
and
back
again
,
and
I
see
in
his
eye
a
strange
look
,
half
of
anger
,
half
of
deep
regret
.
 
<EOS>
be
he
tell
the
truth
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
some
tragic
romance
or
other
concern
a
woman
have
,
I
know
,
overshadow
his
life
in
the
year
before
we
have
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
but
the
real
fact
he
have
never
reveal
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
before
refer
to
the
bitterness
of
the
past
,
although
I
know
full
well
that
his
heart
be
in
secret
fill
by
some
overwhelming
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
outwardly
he
be
as
merry
as
the
other
fellow
who
officer
that
huge
float
fortress
;
on
board
he
be
a
typical
smart
marine
,
and
on
shore
he
dance
and
play
tennis
and
flirt
just
as
vigorously
as
do
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
a
heavy
heart
beat
beneath
his
uniform
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
return
to
where
I
stand
I
see
that
his
face
have
change
:
it
have
become
draw
and
haggard
.
<EOS>
He
bear
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
have
be
strike
a
blow
that
have
stagger
him
,
crush
out
all
life
and
hope
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter

Jack

I
ask

answer
hoarsely

the
blue
just
for

moment

try
hard
to
smile

<EOS>
He
start
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
be
,
I
see
,
hard
set
.
<EOS>
He
know
something
concern
that
mysterious
craft
,
but
would
not
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
sound
of
a
bugle
come
from
the
further
end
of
the
ship
,
and
immediately
man
be
scamper
along
the
deck
beneath
as
some
order

other
be
be
obey
with
that
precision
that
characterize
the

handy
man

"
I
admit

say
at
last
,
stand
astride
with
his
hand
behind
his
back

,
his
sword
trail
on
the
white
deck

You
say

no

white

course

remark

as
though
to
himself

They
would
repaint
and
alter
her
appearance

dining
saloon

there

long
carve
oak
buffet

mouth
close
with
a
snap

He
draw
a
long
breath

his
eye
grow
fierce
,
and
he
bite
his
lip

ah
!

I
see

Frank

anxious

clear
up
the
mystery

they
have
tamper

ashore

attract

stroke

!

call
their

the

and
his
final
word
seem
to
choke
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
before
him
,
open
-
mouthed
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
mean
--
<EOS>
well
,
that
you
be
in
fear
of
them
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
I
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
He
nod
slowly
in
the
affirmative
,
add
:
"
to
tell
you
the
truth
would
be
to
bring
upon
myself
a
swift
,
relentless
vengeance
that
would
overwhelm
and
crush
me
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
fellow
,
you
do
not
know
--
<EOS>
you
can
not
dream
--
<EOS>
what
bring
those
desperate
man
into
this
port
.
<EOS>
I
can
guess
--
<EOS>
I
can
guess
only
too
well
--
but
I
can
only
tell
you
that
if
you
ever
do
discover
the
terrible
truth
--
which
I
fear
be
unlikely
--
you
will
solve
one
of
the
strange
and
most
remarkable
mystery
of
modern
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
the
mystery
concern
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
in
breathless
eagerness

<EOS>
"
It
concern
a
woman

magnificent

in
Europe
,
after
a
week
of
gay
festivity
in
Leghorn
,
have
sail
for
Gaeta
,
while
I

glad
to
escape
from
the
glaring
heat
,
find
myself
back
once
more
in
dear
old
London
.
 
<EOS>
one
pass
one
's
time
in
the
south
well
enough
in
winter
,
but
after
a
year
even
the
most
ardent
lover
of
Italy
long
to
return
to
his
own
people
,
be
it
ever
for
so
brief
a
space
.
<EOS>
exile
for
a
whole
year
in
any
continental
town
be
exile
indeed
;
therefore
,
although
I
live
in
Italy
for
choice
,
I
,
like
so
many
other
englishman
,
always
manage
to
spend
a
month
or
two
in
summer
in
our
temperate
if
much
malign
climate
.
 
<EOS>
London
,
the
same
dear
,
dusty
old
London
,
only
perhaps
more
dear
and
more
dusty
than
ever

my
native
city
;
hence
I
always
spend
a
few
week
in
it
,
even
though
all
the
world
may
be
absent
in
the
country
,
or
at
the
seaside
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
idle
away
a
pleasant
month
up
in
Buxton
,
and
from
there
have
go
north
to
the
Lakes
,
and
it
be
one
hot
evening
in
mid
-
August
that
I
find
myself
again
in
London
,
cross
St.
James
's
Square
from
the
Sports
Club
,
where
I
have
dine
,
walk
towards
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
darkness
have
just
fall
,
and
there
be
that
stifle
oppression
in
the
air
that
fore
-
tokene
a
thunderstorm
.
<EOS>
the
club
be
not
gay
with
life
and
merriment
as
it
be
in
the
season
,
for
everyone
be
away
,
many
of
the
room
be
close
for
re
-
decoration
,
and
most
of
the
furniture
swathe
in
linen
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
on
my
way
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
lady
who
live
up
at
Hampstead
,
a
friend
of
my
late
mother
's
,
and
have
just
turn
into
Pall
Mall
,
when
a
voice
at
my
elbow
suddenly
exclaim
in
Italian--
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
signore!--why
,
actually
,
my
padrone
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
look
round
,
I
see
a
thin
-
faced
man
of
about
thirty
,
dress
in
neat
but
rather
shabby
black
,
whom
I
instantly
recognize
as
a
man
who
have
be
my
servant
in
Leghorn
for
two
year
,
after
which
he
have
leave
to
better
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Olinto
!
"
I
exclaim
,
surprised
,
as
I
halt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
--
in
London
--
eh
?
<EOS>
well
,
and
how
be
you
get
on
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
excellently
,
signore
,
"
he
answer
in
broken
English
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
so
pleasant
for
me
to
see
my
generous
padrone
again
.
<EOS>
what
fortune
it
be
that
I
should
pass
here
at
this
very
moment
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
work
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
the
Restaurant
Milano
,
in
Oxford
Street
--
only
a
small
place
,
<EOS>
but
we
gain
discreetly
,
so
I
must
not
complain
.
<EOS>
I
live
over
in
Lambeth
,
and
be
on
my
way
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
married
after
you
leave
me
.
<EOS>
be
that
true
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
signore
.
<EOS>
I
marry
Armida
,
who
be
in
your
service
when
I
first
enter
it
.
<EOS>
You
remember
her
?
<EOS>
ah
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
she
be
very
ill
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
stand
your
english
climate
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
say
she
will
die
if
she
remain
here
.
<EOS>
yet
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
if
we
go
back
to
Italy
we
shall
only
starve
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
see
that
he
be
in
deep
distress
,
and
that
mention
of
his
ail
wife
have
arouse
within
him
bitter
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
Santini
walk
back
at
my
side
in
the
direction
of
Trafalgar
Square
,
answer
the
question
I
put
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
good
,
hard
-
work
servant
,
and
I
be
glad
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
me
he
have
go
as
steward
on
one
of
the
Anchor
Line
boat
between
Naples
and
New
York
,
and
that
be
the
last
I
have
hear
of
him
until
I
find
him
there
in
London
,
a
waiter
at
a
second
-
rate
restaurant
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
try
to
slip
some
silver
into
his
hand
he
refuse
to
take
it
,
and
with
a
merry
laugh
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
you
would
be
offend
,
signore
,
if
I
tell
you
of
something
for
which
I
have
be
longing
and
longing
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
the
signore
smoke
our
tuscan
cigar
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
by
chance
you
have
one
?
<EOS>
We
can
not
get
them
in
London
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
feel
in
my
pocket
,
laughing
,
and
discover
that
I
have
a
couple
of
those
long
thin
penny
cigar
which
I
always
smoke
in
Italy
,
and
which
be
so
dear
to
the
tuscan
palate
.
<EOS>
these
I
hand
him
,
and
he
take
them
with
delight
as
the
great
delicacy
I
could
have
offer
him
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
as
an
exile
italian
he
cling
to
every
little
trifle
that
remind
him
of
his
own
beloved
country
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
halt
before
the
National
Gallery
prior
to
part
I
make
some
further
inquiry
regard
Armida
,
the
black
-
eyed
,
good
-
look
housemaid
whom
he
have
marry
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
signore
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
respond
in
a
voice
choke
with
emotion
,
drop
into
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
one
great
sorrow
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
work
hard
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
,
but
what
be
the
use
when
I
see
my
poor
wife
gradually
fade
away
before
my
very
eye
?
<EOS>
the
doctor
say
that
she
can
not
possibly
live
through
the
next
winter
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
delight
the
poor
girl
would
be
if
she
could
see
the
padrone
once
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
feel
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
Armida
have
be
a
good
servant
,
and
have
serve
me
well
for
nearly
three
year
.
<EOS>
Old
Rosina
,
my
housekeeper
,
have
often
regret
that
she
have
be
compel
to
leave
to
attend
to
her
aged
mother
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
he
tell
me
,
have
die
,
and
afterwards
he
have
marry
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
romance
and
tragedy
in
the
life
of
the
poor
Italians
in
London
than
London
ever
suspect
.
<EOS>
We
be
too
apt
to
regard
the
Italian
as
a
bloodthirsty
person
give
to
the
unlawful
use
of
the
knife
,
whereas
,
as
a
whole
,
the
italian
colony
in
London
be
a
hard
-
work
,
thrifty
,
and
law
-
abide
one
,
very
different
,
indeed
,
to
those
colony
of
alien
from
Northern
Europe
,
who
be
so
continually
bring
filth
,
disease
,
and
immorality
into
the
East
End
,
and
be
a
useless
incubus
in
an
already
over
-
populate
city
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
so
wistfully
that
his
wife
may
see
me
once
more
that
,
have
nothing
very
particular
to
do
that
evening
,
and
feel
a
deep
sympathy
for
the
poor
fellow
in
his
trouble
,
I
resolve
to
accompany
him
to
his
house
and
see
whether
I
could
not
,
in
some
slight
manner
,
render
him
a
little
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
thank
me
profusely
when
I
consent
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
signor
padrone
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
gratefully
,
"
she
will
be
so
delighted
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
good
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
hail
a
hansom
and
drive
across
Westminster
Bridge
to
the
address
he
give
--
a
gloomy
back
street
off
the
York
Road
,
one
of
those
narrow
,
grimy
thoroughfare
into
which
the
sun
never
shine
.
<EOS>
ah
,
how
often
do
the
poor
Italians
,
those
child
of
the
sun
,
pine
and
die
when
shut
up
in
our
dismal
,
sordid
street
!
<EOS>
Dirt
and
squalor
do
not
affect
them
;
it
be
the
damp
and
cold
and
lack
of
sunshine
that
so
very
soon
prove
fatal
.
 
<EOS>
a
low
-
looking
,
evil
-
face
fellow
open
the
door
to
us
and
growl
acquaintance
with
Olinto
,
who
,
strike
a
match
,
ascend
the
worn
,
carpetless
stair
before
me
,
apologize
for
pass
before
me
,
and
say
in
Italian--
 
"
We
live
at
the
top
,
signore
,
because
it
be
cheap
and
the
air
be
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
quite
right
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
right
.
<EOS>
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
I
hear
my
cab
drive
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
gloomy
,
forbid
,
unlighted
place
into
which
I
would
certainly
have
hesitate
to
enter
<EOS>
have
not
my
companion
be
my
trust
servant
.
<EOS>
I
instinctively
dislike
the
look
of
the
fellow
who
have
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
hulking
loafer
of
the
peculiarly
Lambeth
type
.
<EOS>
yet
the
alien
poor
,
I
recollect
,
can
not
choose
where
they
shall
reside
.
 
<EOS>
Contrary
to
my
expectation
,
the
sitting
-
room
we
enter
on
the
top
floor
be
quite
comfortably
furnish
,
clean
and
respectable
,
even
though
trace
of
poverty
be
apparent
.
<EOS>
a
cheap
lamp
be
burn
upon
the
table
,
but
the
apartment
be
unoccupied
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
,
in
surprise
,
pass
into
the
adjoining
room
,
return
a
moment
later
,
exclaiming--
 
<EOS>
"
Armida
must
have
go
out
to
get
something
.
<EOS>
or
perhaps
she
be
with
the
people
,
a
compositor
and
his
wife
,
who
live
on
the
floor
below
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
good
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
find
her
.
<EOS>
accommodate
yourself
with
a
chair
,
signore
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
draw
the
good
chair
forward
for
me
,
and
dust
it
with
his
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
allow
him
to
go
and
fetch
her
,
rather
surprise
that
she
should
be
well
enough
to
get
about
after
all
he
have
tell
me
concern
her
illness
.
<EOS>
yet
consumption
do
not
keep
people
in
bed
until
its
final
stage
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
stand
there
,
gaze
round
the
room
,
I
could
not
well
distinguish
its
furthermost
corner
,
for
the
lamp
bear
a
shade
of
green
paste
-
board
,
which
throw
a
zone
of
light
upon
the
table
,
and
leave
the
remainder
of
the
room
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
my
eye
grow
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
,
I
discern
that
the
place
be
dusty
and
somewhat
disordered
.
<EOS>
the
sofa
be
,
I
see
,
a
fold
iron
bedstead
with
greasy
old
cushion
,
while
the
carpet
be
threadbare
and
full
of
hole
.
<EOS>
when
I
draw
the
old
rep
curtain
to
look
out
of
the
window
,
I
find
that
the
shutter
be
close
,
which
I
think
unusual
for
a
room
so
high
up
as
that
be
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
return
in
a
few
moment
,
say
that
his
wife
have
evidently
go
to
do
some
shopping
in
the
Lower
-
Marsh
,
for
it
be
the
habit
of
the
denizen
of
that
locality
to
go
"
marketing
"
in
the
evening
among
the
costermonger
'
stall
that
line
so
many
of
the
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
perishable
commodity
,
the
overplus
of
the
market
and
shop
,
be
cheap
at
night
than
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
not
press
for
time
,
signore
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
apologetically
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
the
poor
girl
do
not
know
the
surprise
await
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
surely
not
be
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
wait
,
"
I
say
,
and
fling
myself
back
into
the
chair
he
have
bring
forward
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
offer
you
,
signer
padrone
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
a
visitor
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
Olinto
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
just
have
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
how
you
have
fare
since
you
leave
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
laugh
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
many
up
and
down
before
I
find
myself
here
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
sea
do
not
suit
me
--
neither
do
the
work
.
<EOS>
They
put
me
in
the
emigrant
'
quarter
,
and
consequently
I
could
gain
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
other
steward
be
Neapolitans
,
therefore
,
because
I
be
a
Tuscan
,
they
relegate
me
to
the
bad
post
.
<EOS>
ah
,
signore
,
you
do
not
know
what
it
be
to
serve
those
emigrant
!
<EOS>
I
make
two
trip
,
then
return
and
marry
Armida
.
<EOS>
I
call
on
you
,
but
Tito
say
you
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
get
work
at
a
cafe
in
Viareggio
,
but
when
the
season
end
,
and
I
be
throw
out
of
employment
<EOS>
,
I
manage
to
work
my
way
from
Genoa
to
London
.
<EOS>
My
first
place
be
scullion
in
a
restaurant
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
and
then
I
become
waiter
in
the
beer
-
hall
at
the
Monico
,
and
manage
to
save
sufficient
to
send
Armida
the
money
to
join
me
here
.
<EOS>
afterwards
I
go
to
the
Milano
,
and
I
hope
to
get
into
one
of
the
big
hotel
very
soon
--
or
perhaps
the
grill
-
room
at
the
Carlton
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
who
be
there
,
and
they
make
lot
of
money
--
four
or
five
pound
every
week
in
tip
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
several
hotel
-
manager
who
may
have
a
vacancy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah

signore
!
<EOS>
"
he
cry
,
fill
with
gratification
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
you
only
would
!
<EOS>
a
word
from
you
would
secure
me
a
good
position
.
<EOS>
I
can
work
,
that
you
know
--
and
I
do
work
.
<EOS>
I
will
work
--
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
promise
you
,
"
I
say
briefly
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
can
I
sufficiently
thank
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
stand
before
me
,
while
in
his
eye
I
think
I
detect
a
strange
wild
look
,
such
as
I
have
never
see
there
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
serve
me
well
,
<EOS>
Olinto
,
"
I
reply
,
"
and
when
I
discover
real
sterling
honesty
<EOS>
I
endeavor
to
appreciate
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
very
little
of
it
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
his
manner
suddenly
change
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
to
-
night
show
me
,
signore
,
that
you
be
my
friend
,
and
I
will
,
in
return
,
show
you
that
I
be
yours
.
"
<EOS>
and
suddenly
grasp
both
my
hand
,
he
pull
me
from
the
chair
in
which
I
be
sit
,
at
the
same
time
ask
in
a
low
intense
whisper
:
"
do
you
always
carry
a
revolver
here
in
England
,
as
you
do
in
Italy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
answer
in
surprise
at
his
action
and
his
question
.
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
there
be
danger
here
,
"
he
answer
in
the
same
low
earnest
tone
.
"
<EOS>
get
your
weapon
ready
.
<EOS>
You
may
want
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
,
"
I
say
,
feel
my
handy
Colt
in
my
back
pocket
to
make
sure
it
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
forget
what
I
have
say
--
all
--
all
that
I
have
tell
you
to
-
night
,
sir
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
explain
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
You
be
in
peril
--
in
deadly
peril
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
breathlessly
,
surprised
at
his
extraordinary
change
of
manner
and
his
evident
apprehension
lest
something
should
befall
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
wait
,
and
you
shall
see
,
"
he
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
but
first
tell
me
,
signore
,
that
you
will
forgive
me
for
the
part
I
have
play
in
this
dastardly
affair
.
<EOS>
I
,
like
yourself
,
fall
innocently
into
the
hand
of
your
enemy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
enemy
!
<EOS>
who
be
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
unknown
,
and
for
the
present
must
remain
so
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
doubt
your
peril
,
watch--
"
and
take
the
rusty
fire
-
tong
from
the
grate
he
carefully
place
them
on
end
in
front
of
the
deep
old
armchair
in
which
I
have
sit
,
and
then
allow
them
to
fall
against
the
edge
of
the
seat
,
spring
quickly
back
as
he
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
a
bright
blue
flash
shot
through
the
place
,
and
the
iron
fall
aside
,
fuse
and
twist
out
of
all
recognition
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
aghast
,
utterly
unable
for
the
moment
to
sufficiently
realize
how
narrowly
I
have
escape
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
!
<EOS>
see
here
,
behind
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
Italian
,
direct
my
attention
to
the
back
leg
of
the
chair
,
where
,
on
bend
with
the
lamp
,
I
see
,
to
my
surprise
,
that
two
wire
be
connect
,
and
run
along
the
floor
and
out
of
the
window
,
while
conceal
beneath
the
ragged
carpet
,
in
front
of
the
chair
,
be
a
thin
plate
of
steel
,
whereon
my
foot
have
rest
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
have
so
ingeniously
entice
me
to
that
gloomy
house
of
death
have
connect
up
the
overhead
electric
light
main
with
that
innocent
-
look
chair
,
and
from
some
unseen
point
have
be
able
to
switch
on
a
current
of
sufficient
voltage
to
kill
fifty
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
stock
-
still
,
not
dare
to
move
lest
I
may
come
into
contact
with
some
hide
wire
,
the
slight
touch
of
which
must
bring
instant
death
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
enemy
prepare
this
terrible
trap
for
you
,
"
declare
the
man
who
be
once
my
trust
servant
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
enter
into
the
affair
I
be
not
aware
that
it
be
to
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
They
give
me
no
inkling
of
their
dastardly
intention
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
time
to
admit
of
explanation
now
,
signore
,
"
he
add
breathlessly
,
in
a
low
desperate
voice
.
"
<EOS>
say
that
you
will
not
prejudge
me
,
"
he
plead
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
prejudge
you
until
I
have
hear
your
explanation
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
owe
my
life
to
you
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
quick
!
<EOS>
fly
from
this
house
this
instant
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
stop
,
then
use
your
revolver
.
<EOS>
do
not
hesitate
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
they
will
be
here
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
who
be
they
,
Olinto
?
<EOS>
You
must
tell
me
,
"
I
cry
in
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dio
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
go
!
<EOS>
go
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
push
me
violently
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
fly
,
or
we
shall
both
die
--
both
of
us
!
<EOS>
run
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
feint
of
dash
after
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
turn
,
and
see
his
desperate
eagerness
,
precipitately
flee
,
while
he
run
down
behind
me
,
utter
fierce
imprecation
in
Italian
,
as
though
I
have
escape
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
in
the
narrow
dark
passage
attempt
to
trip
me
up
as
I
run
,
but
I
fire
point
blank
at
him
,
and
gain
the
door
unlock
it
,
and
an
instant
later
find
myself
out
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
narrow
escape
from
death
that
I
have
ever
have
in
all
my
life
--
surely
the
strange
and
most
remarkable
adventure
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
do
it
mean
?
 
<EOS>
next
morning
I
search
up
and
down
Oxford
Street
for
the
Restaurant
Milano
,
but
could
not
find
it
.
<EOS>
I
ask
shopkeeper
,
postman
,
and
policeman
;
I
examine
the
London
Directory
at
the
bar
of
the
Oxford
Music
Hall
,
and
make
every
inquiry
possible
.
<EOS>
but
all
be
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
no
one
know
of
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
restaurant
in
plenty
in
Oxford
Street
,
from
the
Frascati
down
to
the
humble
coffeeshop
,
but
nobody
have
ever
hear
of
the
"
Milano
.
"
 
<EOS>
even
Olinto
have
play
me
false
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
fill
with
chagrin
,
for
I
have
trust
him
as
honest
,
upright
,
and
industrious
;
and
be
puzzle
to
know
the
reason
he
have
deceive
me
,
and
why
he
have
entice
me
to
the
very
brink
of
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
that
he
himself
have
fall
into
the
trap
lay
by
my
enemy
,
and
yet
he
have
steadfastly
refuse
to
tell
me
who
they
be
!
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
be
utterly
inexplicable
.
 
<EOS>
I
drive
over
to
Lambeth
and
wander
through
the
maze
of
mean
street
off
the
York
Road
,
yet
for
the
life
of
me
<EOS>
I
could
not
decide
into
which
house
I
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dozen
which
seem
to
me
that
they
may
be
the
identical
house
from
which
I
have
so
narrowly
escape
with
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
gradually
it
become
impressed
upon
me
that
my
ex
-
servant
have
somehow
gain
knowledge
that
I
be
in
London
,
that
he
have
watch
my
exit
from
the
club
,
and
that
all
his
pitiful
story
regard
Armida
be
false
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
envoy
of
my
unknown
enemy
,
who
have
so
ingeniously
and
so
relentlessly
plot
my
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
enemy
I
know
quite
well
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
believe
he
have
not
be
an
arrant
fool
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
breathe
who
have
not
an
enemy
,
from
the
pauper
in
the
workhouse
to
the
king
in
his
automobile
.
<EOS>
but
the
unseen
enemy
be
always
the
more
dangerous
;
hence
my
deep
apprehensive
reflection
that
day
as
I
walk
those
sordid
back
street
"
over
the
water
,
"
as
the
Cockney
refer
to
the
district
between
those
two
main
artery
of
traffic
,
the
Waterloo
and
Westminster
Bridge
Roads
.
 
<EOS>
My
unknown
enemy
have
secure
the
service
of
Olinto
in
their
dastardly
plot
to
kill
me
.
<EOS>
with
what
motive
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
I
cross
Waterloo
Bridge
to
the
Strand
,
whether
Olinto
Santini
would
again
approach
me
and
make
the
promise
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
have
give
my
word
not
to
prejudge
him
until
he
reveal
to
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
yet
I
could
not
,
in
the
circumstance
,
repose
entire
confidence
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
one
's
enemy
be
unknown
,
the
feeling
of
apprehension
be
always
much
great
,
for
in
the
imagination
danger
lurk
in
every
corner
,
and
every
action
of
a
friend
cover
the
ruse
of
a
suspect
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
that
day
I
do
my
business
in
the
city
with
a
distrust
of
everyone
,
not
know
whether
I
be
not
follow
or
whether
those
who
seek
my
life
be
not
plot
some
other
equally
ingenious
move
whereby
I
may
go
innocently
to
my
death
.
<EOS>
I
endeavor
to
discover
Olinto
by
every
possible
mean
during
those
stifle
day
that
follow
.
<EOS>
the
heat
of
London
be
,
to
me
,
more
oppressive
than
the
fiery
sunshine
of
the
old
-
world
Tuscany
,
and
everyone
who
could
be
out
of
town
have
leave
for
the
country
or
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
trace
I
find
of
the
Italian
be
that
he
be
register
at
the
office
of
the
International
Society
of
Hotel
Servants
,
in
Shaftesbury
Avenue
,
as
be
employ
at
Gatti
's
Adelaide
Gallery
,
but
on
inquiry
there
I
find
he
have
leave
more
than
a
year
before
,
and
none
of
his
fellow
-
waiter
know
his
whereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
defeat
in
every
inquiry
,
and
my
business
at
last
conclude
in
London
,
I
go
up
to
dumfrie
on
a
duty
visit
which
I
pay
annually
to
my
uncle
,
Sir
George
Little
.
<EOS>
have
know
dumfrie
since
my
early
boyhood
,
and
have
spend
some
year
of
my
youth
there
,
I
have
many
friend
in
the
vicinity
,
for
Sir
George
and
my
aunt
be
very
popular
in
the
county
and
move
in
the
good
set
.
 
<EOS>
each
time
I
return
from
abroad
<EOS>
I
be
always
a
welcome
guest
at
Greenlaw
,
as
their
place
outside
the
city
of
Burns
be
call
,
and
this
occasion
prove
no
exception
,
for
the
country
house
of
dumfrie
be
always
gay
in
August
in
prospect
of
the
shooting
.
 
<EOS>
"
some
new
people
have
take
Rannoch
Castle
.
<EOS>
rather
nice
they
seem
,
"
remark
my
aunt
as
we
be
sit
together
at
luncheon
the
day
after
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
"
Their
name
be
Leithcourt
,
and
they
have
ask
me
to
drive
you
over
there
to
tennis
this
afternoon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
much
of
a
player
,
you
know
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
in
Italy
we
do
not
believe
in
athletic
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
out
of
politeness
,
of
course
,
I
will
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
order
the
victoria
for
three
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
several
nice

remark
my
uncle
mischievously
.
<EOS>
"
You

a
good
time
,
so
do
not
think
you
be
go
to
be
bore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
fear
of
that
,
"
be
my
answer
.
<EOS>
and
at
three
o'clock
Sir
George
,
his
wife
,
and
myself
set
out
for
that
fine
old
historic
castle
that
stand
high
on
the
Bognie
,
overlook
the
Cairn
water
beyond
Dunscore
,
one
of
the
stronghold
of
the
Black
Douglas
in
those
turbulent
day
of
long
ago
,
and
now
a
splendid
old
residence
with
a
big
shoot
which
be
sometimes
let
for
the
season
at
a
very
high
rent
by
its
aristocratic
if
somewhat
impecunious
owner
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
see
its
great
round
tower
,
stand
grim
and
gray
on
the
hillside
command
the
whole
of
the
valley
,
long
before
we
approach
it
,
and
when
we
drive
into
the
ground
we
find
a
gay
party
in
summer
<EOS>
toilette
assemble
on
the
ancient
bowling
-
green
,
now
transform
into
a
modern
tennis
-
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
and
her
husband
,
a
tall
,
thin
,
gray
-
headed
,
well
-
dress
man
,
both
come
forward
to
greet
us
,
and
after
a
few
introduction
I
join
a
set
at
tennis
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
merry
crowd
.
<EOS>
the
Leithcourts
be
entertain
a
large
house
-
party
,
and
their
hospitality
be
on
a
scale
quite
in
keeping
with
the
fine
old
place
they
rent
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
be
serve
on
the
lawn
by
the
footman
,
and
afterwards
,
be
tired
of
the
game
<EOS>
,
I
find
myself
stroll
with
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
a
bright

dark

with
tightly

bind
hair

and

<EOS>
I
be

for
my
terribly
bad
play

explain
that
I
have
no
practice
out

whereupon
<EOS>
she
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I

Naples
with
mother
last
season
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
begin
to
discuss
picture
and
sculpture
and
the
sight
of
Italy
generally
.
<EOS>
I
discern
from
her
remark
that
she
have
travel
widely
;
indeed
,
she
tell
me
that
both
her
father
and
mother
be
never
happy
than
when
move
from
place
to
place
in
search
of
variety
and
distraction
.
<EOS>
We
have
enter
the
huge
panel
hall
of
the
Castle
,
and
have
pass
up
the
quaint
old
stone
staircase
to
the
long
banqueting
hall
with
its
paneled
oak
ceiling
,
which
in
these
modern
day
have
be
transform
into
a
bright
,
pleasant
drawing
-
room
,
from
the
window
of
which
be
present
a
marvelous
view
over
the
lovely
Nithsdale
and
across
to
the
heather
-
clothe
hill
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
lounge
there
in
the
cool
old
room
after
the
hot
sunshine
outside
,
and
as
I
gaze
around
the
place
I
note
how
much
more
luxurious
and
tasteful
<EOS>
it
now
be
to
what
it
have
be
in
the
day
when
I
have
visit
its
owner
several
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
awfully
glad
to
be
up
here
,
"
my
pretty
companion
be
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
such
a
busy
season
in
London
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
go
on
to
describe
the
Court
ball
,
and
two
or
three
of
the
most
notable
function
about
which
I
have
read
in
my
english
paper
beside
the
Mediterranean
.
 
<EOS>
She
attract
me
on
account
of
her
bright
vivacity
,
quick
wit
and
keen
sense
of
humor
,
therefore
I
sit
listen
to
her
pleasant
chatter
.
<EOS>
exile
as
I
be
in
a
foreign
land
,
I
seldom
speak
English
save
with
Hutcheson
,
the
Consul
,
and
even
then
we
generally
speak
italian
if
there
be
other
present
,
in
order
that
our
companion
should
understand
.
<EOS>
therefore
her
gossip
interest
me
,
and
as
the
golden
sunset
flood
the
handsome
old
room
I
sit
listen
to
her
,
inwardly
admire
her
innate
grace
and
handsome
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
who
or
what
her
father
be
--
whether
a
wealthy
manufacturer
,
like
so
many
who
take
expensive
shoot
and
give
big
entertainment
in
order
to
edge
their
way
into
Society
by
its
back
door
,
or
whether
he
be
a
gentleman
of
mean
and
of
good
family
.
<EOS>
I
rather
guess
the
latter
,
from
his
gentlemanly
bearing
and
polished
manner
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
,
tall
and
erect
,
be
that
of
a
retired
officer
,
and
his
clean
-
cut
face
be
one
of
mark
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
my
pretty
companion
something
of
my
own
life
,
<EOS>
how
,
because
I
love
Italy
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
live
in
Tuscany
in
preference
to
live
in
England
,
and
how
each
year
I
come
home
for
a
month
or
two
to
visit
my
relation
and
to
keep
in
touch
with
thing
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
she
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
once
in
Leghorn
for
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
We
be
yacht
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
I
love
the
sea
--
and
yachting
be
such
awfully
good
fun
,
if
you
only
get
decent
weather
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
mention
of
yacht
bring
back
to
my
mind
the
visit
of
the
_
Lola
_
and
its
mysterious
sequel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
have
a
yacht
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
,
with
as
little
concern
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
the
_
Iris
_
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
cruise
on
her
up
the
norwegian
Fiords
.
<EOS>
for
us
it
be
a
change
to
be
here
,
because
we
be
so
often
afloat
.
<EOS>
We
go
across
to
New
York
in
her
last
year
and
have
a
most
delightful
time
--
except
for
one
bad
squall
which
make
us
all
a
little
bit
nervous
.
<EOS>
but
Moyes
be
such
an
excellent
captain
that
I
never
fear
.
<EOS>
the
crew
be
all
North
Sea
fisherman
--
father
will
engage
nobody
else
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
you
must
have
make
many
long
voyage
,
and
see
many
odd
corner
of
the
world
,
Miss
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
,
my
interest
in
her
increasing
,
for
she
seem
so
extremely
intelligent
and
well
-
inform
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
to
Mexico
,
and
to
Panama
,
besides
Morocco
,
Egypt
,
and
the
West
Coast
of
Africa
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
actually
land
at
Leghorn
!
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
we
do
not
stay
there
more
than
an
hour
--
to
send
a
telegram
,
I
think
it
be
.
<EOS>
Father
say
there
be
nothing
to
see
there
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
go
ashore
,
and
I
must
say
I
be
rather
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
the
town
itself
be
ugly
and
uninteresting
.
<EOS>
but
the
outskirt
--
San
Jacopo
,
Ardenza
and
Antigniano
be
all
delightful
.
<EOS>
It
be
unfortunate
that
you
do
not
see
them
.
<EOS>
be
it
long
ago
when
you
put
in
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
very
long
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
recollect
the
exact
date
,
"
be
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
on
our
way
home
from
Alexandria
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
ever
,
in
any
of
the
port
you
have
be
,
see
a
yacht
call
the
_
Lola
_
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
eagerly
,
for
it
occur
to
me
that
perhaps
she
may
be
able
to
give
me
information
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
_
Lola
_
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasp
,
and
instantly
her
face
change
.
<EOS>
a
flush
overspread
her
cheek
,
succeed
next
moment
by
a
death
-
like
pallor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
_
Lola
_
!
<EOS>
"
she
repeat
in
a
strange
,
hoarse
voice
,
at
the
same
time
endeavor
strenuously
not
to
exhibit
any
apprehension
.
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
of
any
such
a
vessel
.
<EOS>
be
she
a
steam
-
yacht
?
<EOS>
who
be
her
owner
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
regard
her
in
amazement
and
suspicion
,
for
I
see
that
mention
of
the
name
have
arouse
within
her
some
serious
misgiving
.
<EOS>
that
look
in
her
dark
eye
as
they
fix
themselves
upon
me
be
one
of
distinct
and
unspeakable
terror
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
she
possibly
know
concern
the
mysterious
craft
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
the
owner
's
name
,
"
I
say
,
still
affect
not
to
have
notice
her
alarm
and
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
the
vessel
run
aground
at
the
Meloria
,
a
dangerous
shoal
outside
Leghorn
,
and
through
the
stupidity
of
her
captain
be
very
nearly
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
?
<EOS>
"
she
gasp
,
in
a
half
-
whisper
,
bend
to
me
eagerly
,
unable
to
sufficiently
conceal
the
terrible
anxiety
consume
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
--
do
you
go
aboard
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
be
the
only
word
I
utter
.
 
<EOS>
a
silence
fall
between
us
,
and
as
my
eye
fix
themselves
upon
her
,
I
see
that
from
her
handsome
mobile
countenance
all
the
light
and
life
have
suddenly
go
out
,
and
I
know
that
she
be
in
secret
possession
of
the
key
to
that
remarkable
enigma
that
so
puzzle
me
.
 
<EOS>
of
a
sudden
the
door
open
,
and
a
voice
cry
gayly--
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
have
be
look
everywhere
for
you
,
Muriel
.
<EOS>
why
be
you
hide
here
?
<EOS>
be
not
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
both
turn
,
and
as
she
do
so
a
low
cry
of
blank
dismay
involuntarily
escape
her
.
 
<EOS>
next
instant
<EOS>
I
spring
to
my
foot
.
<EOS>
the
reason
of
her
cry
be
apparent
,
for
there
,
in
the
full
light
of
the
golden
sunset
stream
through
the
long
open
window
,
stand
a
broad
-
shouldered
,
fair
-
bearded
man
in
tennis
flannel
and
a
Panama
hat
--
the
fugitive
I
know
as
Philip
Hornby
!
 
<EOS>
I
face
him
,
speechless
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV
 
<EOS>
in
which
the
mystery
increase
  
<EOS>
neither
of
us
speak
.
<EOS>
equally
surprised
at
the
unexpected
encounter
,
we
stand
face
each
other
dumbfound
.
 
<EOS>
Hornby
start
quickly
as
soon
as
his
eye
fall
upon
me
,
and
his
face
become
blanch
to
the
lip
,
while
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
quick
to
notice
the
sudden
change
in
him
,
rise
and
introduce
us
in
as
calm
a
voice
as
she
could
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
be
acquaint
,
"
she
say
to
me
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
Mr.
Martin
Woodroffe
--
<EOS>
Mr
.
Gordon
Gregg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
bow
to
him
in
sudden
resolve
to
remain
silent
in
pretense
that
I
doubt
whether
the
man
before
me
be
actually
my
host
of
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
act
as
though
I
be
not
sufficiently
convinced
to
openly
express
my
doubt
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
bow
,
exchange
greeting
as
stranger
,
while
,
carefully
watch
,
I
see
how
greatly
the
mind
of
both
be
relieve
.
<EOS>
They
shoot
meaning
glance
at
each
other
,
and
then
,
as
though
reassure
that
I
be
mystified
and
uncertain
,
the
man
who
call
himself
Woodroffe
explain
to
my
companion------
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
over
to
Newton
Stewart
with
Fred
all
day
,
and
only
get
back
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
be
not
you
play
any
more
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
be
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
out
there
the
whole
afternoon
,
and
I
be
rather
tired
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
still
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
You
can
surely
get
a
game
with
someone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
play
,
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
keep
the
promise
I
make
this
morning
,
"
he
laugh
,
stand
before
the
big
open
fireplace
,
hold
his
tennis
racquet
behind
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
examine
his
countenance
,
and
be
more
than
ever
convince
that
he
be
actually
the
man
who
give
me
the
name
of
Hornby
and
the
false
address
in
Somerset
.
<EOS>
the
pair
seem
to
be
on
familiar
term
,
and
I
wonder
whether
they
be
engage
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
the
man
seem
quite
at
home
there
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
chat
with
the
daughter
of
the
house
,
he
cast
a
quick
,
covert
glance
at
me
,
and
then
dart
a
meaning
look
at
her
--
a
look
of
renew
confidence
,
as
though
he
feel
that
he
have
successfully
avert
any
suspicion
I
may
have
hold
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
of
the
prospect
of
the
grouse
and
the
salmon
,
and
from
his
remark
he
seem
to
be
as
keen
at
sport
as
he
have
once
make
out
himself
to
be
at
yachting
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Leithcourt
be
awfully
fortunate
in
get
such
a
splendid
old
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
on
every
hand
I
hear
glow
account
of
the
number
of
bird
.
<EOS>
the
place
have
be
well
preserve
in
the
past
,
and
there
be
plenty
of
good
cover
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Gilrae
,
the
owner
,
be
a
keen
sportsman
,
and
before
he
become
so
hard
up
<EOS>
he
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
the
estate
,
which
,
I
believe
,
have
always
be
consider
one
of
the
very
good
in
the
southwest
.
<EOS>
there
be
salmon
,
they
say
,
down
in
the
Glen
yonder
--
<EOS>
but
I
have
never
try
for
any
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
there
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
several
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
try
one
of
these
day
.
<EOS>
the
Glen
be
deep
and
shady
--
an
ideal
place
for
fish
.
<EOS>
the
only
disappointment
here
,
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
be
the
very
few
head
of
black
-
game
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
but
every
year
they
be
get
rare
and
rarer
in
this
part
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
a
really
fine
black
-
cock
be
quite
an
event
nowadays
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
talk
,
or
rather
while
I
be
carefully
watch
the
rapid
working
of
his
mind
,
Leithcourt
himself
enter
and
join
us
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
play
tennis
,
and
have
come
in
to
rest
and
cool
.
 
<EOS>
host
and
guest
be
evidently
on
the
most
intimate
term
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
address
him
as
"
Martin
,
"
and
begin
to
relate
a
quarrel
which
his
head
-
gamekeeper
have
have
that
day
with
one
of
the
small
farmer
on
the
estate
regard
the
killing
of
some
rabbit
.
<EOS>
and
while
they
be
talk
Muriel
suggest
that
we
should
stroll
down
to
the
tennis
-
court
again
,
an
invitation
which
,
much
as
I
regret
leave
the
two
man
,
I
be
bind
to
accept
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
she
wish
purposely
to
take
me
away
from
that
man
's
presence
,
fear
that
by
remain
there
long
my
suspicion
may
become
confirm
.
<EOS>
She
be
act
in
conjunction
with
the
man
whom
I
have
know
as
Hornby
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
still
a
good
many
people
watch
the
game
,
for
it
be
pleasant
in
those
old
-
world
garden
in
the
sunset
hour
.
<EOS>
the
dry
-
up
moat
be
now
transform
into
a
garden
fill
with
rhododendron
and
bright
azaleas
,
while
the
high
ancient
beech
-
hedge
,
the
quaint
old
sundial
with
its
motto
:
"
each
time
ye
shadowe
turneth
ys
one
daye
nearer
unto
dethe
,
"
and
the
old
stone
balustrade
gray
with
lichen
,
all
speak
mutely
of
those
glorious
day
when
the
fierce
horseman
of
the
Lairds
of
Rannoch
be
fear
across
the
border
,
and
when
many
a
prisoner
of
the
Black
Douglas
have
pine
and
die
in
those
narrow
stone
chamber
in
the
grim
north
tower
that
still
stand
high
above
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
party
stroll
and
lounge
there
prior
to
departure
be
quite
a
number
of
people
I
know
,
people
who
have
shooting
-
box
in
the
vicinity
and
be
my
uncle
's
friend
.
<EOS>
in
Scotland
there
be
always
a
hearty
hospitality
among
the
sporting
folk
,
and
the
law
of
caste
be
far
less
rigorous
than
they
be
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
stand
chat
with
two
lady
who
be
about
to
take
leave
of
their
hostess
,
when
Leithcourt
return
,
but
alone
.
<EOS>
hornby
have
not
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
be
it
because
he
fear
to
again
meet
me
?
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
ascertain
something
regard
the
man
who
have
so
mysteriously
flee
from
Leghorn
,
I
manage
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
diplomacy
to
sit
on
the
lawn
with
a
young
married
woman
name
Tennant
,
wife
of
a
cavalry
captain
,
who
be
one
of
the
house
-
party
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
time
I
succeed
in
turn
the
conversation
to
her
fellow
guest
,
and
more
particularly
to
the
man
I
know
as
Hornby
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodroffe
be
most
amusing
,
"
declare
the
bright
little
woman
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
play
some
practical
joke
or
other
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
he
be
usually
the
life
and
soul
of
our
party
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
like
what
little
I
have
see
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
good
fellow
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
that
he
be
engage
to
Muriel
,
"
I
hazard
.
<EOS>
"
be
that
true
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
engage
nearly
a
year
,
but
he
be
be
abroad
until
quite
lately
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
close
about
his
own
affair
,
and
never
talk
about
his
travel
and
adventure
,
although
one
day
Mr.
Leithcourt
declare
that
his
hairbreadth
escape
would
make
a
most
exciting
book
if
ever
write
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
and
<EOS>
he
be
evidently
most
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
quite
inseparable
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
other
man
who
be
always
with
them
be
that
short
,
stout
,
red
-
face
old
fellow
stand
over
there
with
the
lady
in
pale
blue
,
Sir
Ughtred
Gardner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodroffe
have
nickname
him
'
Sir
Putrid
.
'
"
<EOS>
and
we
both
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
do
not
say
I
say
so
,
"
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
not
call
him
that
to
his
face
,
but
it
be
so
easy
to
make
a
mistake
in
his
name
when
he
be
not
within
hearing
.
<EOS>
We
woman
do
not
care
for
him
,
so
the
nickname
just
fit
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
she
gossip
on
,
tell
me
much
that
I
desire
to
know
regard
the
new
tenant
of
Rannoch
and
his
friend
,
and
more
especially
of
that
man
who
have
first
introduce
himself
to
me
in
the
Consulate
at
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
my
uncle
's
carriage
be
announce
,
and
I
leave
with
the
distinct
impression
that
there
be
some
deep
mystery
surround
the
Leithcourts
.
<EOS>
what
it
be
,
however
,
I
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
make
out
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
Philip
Leithcourt
's
intimate
relation
with
the
man
who
have
so
cleverly
deceive
me
that
incite
my
curiosity
concern
him
;
perhaps
it
be
that
mysterious
intuition
,
that
curious
presage
of
evil
that
sometimes
come
to
a
man
as
warning
of
impend
peril
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
reason
,
I
have
become
fill
with
grave
apprehension
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
grow
deep
day
by
day
,
and
be
inexplicable
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
week
that
follow
I
seek
to
learn
all
I
could
regard
the
new
people
at
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
take
up
everywhere
,
"
declare
my
aunt
when
I
question
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
,
we
know
very
little
of
them
,
except
that
they
have
a
shoot
up
near
Fort
William
two
year
ago
,
and
that
they
have
a
town
house
in
Green
Street
.
<EOS>
They
be
evidently
rather
smart
folk
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
judge
from
their
house
-
party
,
yes
,
"
I
respond
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
about
as
gay
a
crowd
as
one
could
find
north
of
Carlisle
just
at
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
well
-
know
people
among
them
,
too
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
ask
them
over
to
-
morrow
afternoon
,
and
they
have
accept
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
excellent
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
,
for
I
want
an
opportunity
for
another
chat
with
the
dark
-
eyed
girl
who
be
engage
to
the
man
whose
alia
be
Hornby
.
<EOS>
I
particularly
desire
to
ascertain
the
reason
of
her
fear
when
I
have
mention
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
whether
she
possess
any
knowledge
of
Hylton
Chater
.
 
<EOS>
the
opportunity
come
to
me
in
due
course
,
for
next
afternoon
the
Rannoch
party
drive
over
in
two
large
brake
,
and
with
other
people
from
the
neighborhood
and
a
band
from
dumfrie
,
my
aunt
's
ground
present
a
gay
and
animated
scene
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
usual
tennis
and
croquet
,
while
some
of
the
man
enjoy
a
little
putting
on
the
excellent
course
my
uncle
,
a
golf
enthusiast
,
have
recently
lay
down
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
expect
,
Woodroffe
do
not
accompany
the
party
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
,
a
slightly
fussy
little
woman
,
apologize
for
his
absence
,
explain
that
he
have
be
recall
to
London
suddenly
a
few
day
before
,
but
be
return
to
Rannoch
again
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
could
not
afford
to
lose
him
,
"
she
declare
to
my
aunt
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
so
awfully
humorous
--
<EOS>
his
droll
saying
and
antic
keep
us
in
a
perfect
roar
each
night
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
perfect
mimic
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turn
away
and
stroll
with
Muriel
,
plead
an
excuse
to
show
her
my
uncle
's
beautiful
ground
,
not
a
whit
less
picturesque
than
those
of
the
castle
,
and
perhaps
rather
better
keep
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
hear
yesterday
of
your
engagement
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
remark
presently
when
we
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
allow
me
to
offer
my
good
congratulation
.
<EOS>
when
you
introduce
me
to
Mr.
Woodroffe
the
other
day
I
have
no
idea
that
he
be
to
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
glance
at
me
quickly
,
and
I
see
in
her
dark
eye
a
look
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
then
she
flush
slightly
,
and
laugh
uneasily
say
,
in
a
blank
,
hard
voice--
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
good
of
you
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
to
wish
me
all
sort
of
such
pleasant
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
when
be
the
happy
event
to
take
place
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
date
be
not
exactly
fix
--
early
next
year
,
I
believe
,
"
and
I
think
she
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
probably
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
yacht
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
,
my
eye
fix
upon
her
in
order
to
watch
the
result
of
my
pointed
remark
.
<EOS>
but
she
control
herself
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
love
the
sea
,
"
she
respond
briefly
,
and
her
eye
be
set
straight
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Woodroffe
have
go
up
to
town
,
your
mother
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
<EOS>
He
receive
a
wire
,
and
have
to
leave
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
awful
bore
,
for
we
have
arrange
to
go
for
a
picnic
to
Dundrennan
Abbey
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
be
back
here
again
,
will
not
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
seem
quite
uncertain
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
this
morning
which
say
he
may
have
to
go
over
to
Hamburg
on
business
,
instead
of
come
up
to
us
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
disappointment
in
her
voice
,
and
yet
at
the
same
time
I
could
not
fail
to
recognize
how
the
man
to
whom
she
be
engage
have
flee
from
Scotland
because
of
my
presence
.
 
<EOS>
how
I
long
to
ask
her
point
-
blank
what
she
really
know
of
the
yachtsman
who
be
shroud
in
so
much
mystery
.
<EOS>
yet
by
betray
any
undue
anxiety
I
should
certainly
negative
all
my
effort
to
solve
the
puzzle
enigma
,
therefore
I
be
compel
to
remain
content
with
ask
ingeniously
disguise
question
and
draw
my
own
conclusion
from
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
pass
along
those
gravel
walk
<EOS>
it
somehow
become
vividly
impressed
upon
me
that
her
marriage
be
be
force
upon
her
by
her
parent
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
that
of
one
who
be
conceal
some
strange
and
terrible
secret
which
she
fear
may
be
reveal
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
distant
look
of
unutterable
terror
in
those
dark
eye
as
though
she
exist
in
some
constant
and
ever
-
present
dread
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
tell
me
nothing
of
her
own
feeling
or
affection
,
yet
I
recognize
in
both
her
word
and
her
bear
a
curious
apathy
--
a
want
of
the
real
enthusiasm
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
,
much
her
senior
,
be
her
father
's
friend
,
and
it
therefore
seem
to
me
more
than
likely
that
Leithcourt
be
press
a
matrimonial
alliance
upon
his
daughter
for
some
ulterior
motive
.
<EOS>
in
the
mad
hurry
for
place
,
power
,
and
wealth
,
man
relentlessly
sell
their
daughter
in
the
matrimonial
market
,
and
ambitious
mother
scheme
and
intrigue
for
their
own
aggrandizement
at
sacrifice
of
their
daughter
's
happiness
more
often
than
the
public
ever
dream
.
<EOS>
Tragedy
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
write
upon
the
face
of
many
a
bride
whose
portrait
appear
in
the
fashion
-
paper
and
whose
toilette
be
so
faithfully
chronicle
in
the
paragraph
beneath
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
girl
in
Society
who
be
allow
her
own
free
choice
in
the
matter
of
a
husband
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
nowadays
the
exception
,
for
parent
who
want
to
"
get
on
"
up
the
social
scale
have
find
that
pretty
daughter
be
a
marketable
commodity
,
and
many
a
man
have
be
place
"
on
his
leg
,
"
both
financially
and
socially
,
by
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
hence
the
marriage
of
convenience
be
fast
become
common
,
while
in
the
same
ratio
the
divorce
petition
be
unfortunately
on
the
increase
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
tragedy
in
the
dark
luminous
eye
of
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
her
young
heart
be
over
-
burden
by
some
secret
sorrow
or
guilty
knowledge
that
she
would
reveal
to
me
if
she
dare
.
<EOS>
Her
own
word
tell
me
that
she
be
perplex
;
that
she
long
to
confide
and
seek
advice
of
someone
,
yet
by
reason
of
some
hide
and
untoward
circumstance
her
lip
be
seal
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
question
her
further
regard
Woodroffe
,
of
what
profession
he
follow
and
of
his
past
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
evidently
suspect
me
,
for
I
have
unfortunately
mention
the
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
She
want
to
speak
to
me
in
confidence
,
and
yet
she
would
reveal
to
me
nothing
--
absolutely
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
Woodroffe
do
not
rejoin
the
house
-
party
at
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
remain
the
guest
of
my
uncle
much
longer
than
I
intend
,
indeed
right
through
the
shooting
season
,
in
order
to
watch
the
Leithcourts
,
yet
as
far
as
we
could
judge
they
be
extremely
well
-
breed
people
and
very
hospitable
.
 
<EOS>
We
exchange
a
good
many
visit
and
dinner
,
and
while
my
uncle
several
time
invite
Leithcourt
and
his
friend
to
his
shoot
with
_
al
fresco
_
luncheon
,
which
the
lady
join
,
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
always
invite
us
back
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
thus
I
gain
many
opportunity
of
talk
with
Muriel
,
and
of
watch
her
closely
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
reputation
of
be
a
confirm
bachelor
,
and
on
account
of
that
it
seem
that
she
be
in
no
way
averse
to
my
companionship
.
<EOS>
She
could
handle
a
rook
-
rifle
as
well
as
any
woman
,
and
be
really
a
very
fair
shot
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
often
find
ourselves
alone
tramp
across
the
wide
open
moorland
,
or
along
those
delightful
glen
of
the
Nithsdale
,
glorious
in
the
autumn
tint
of
their
luxurious
foliage
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seem
to
view
me
with
considerable
suspicion
,
and
I
could
easily
discern
that
I
be
only
ask
to
Rannoch
because
it
be
impossible
to
invite
my
uncle
without
include
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Leithcourt
,
who
perhaps
think
I
be
court
his
daughter
,
be
ever
endeavor
to
avoid
me
,
and
would
never
allow
me
to
walk
with
him
alone
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
.
<EOS>
do
he
fear
me
?
<EOS>
have
Woodroffe
tell
him
of
our
strange
encounter
in
Leghorn
?
 
<EOS>
His
pronounce
antipathy
towards
me
cause
me
to
watch
him
surreptitiously
,
and
more
closely
than
perhaps
I
should
otherwise
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
gloomy
mood
,
and
often
he
would
leave
his
guest
and
take
walk
alone
,
muse
and
brooding
.
<EOS>
on
several
occasion
I
follow
him
in
secret
,
and
find
to
my
surprise
that
although
he
make
long
detour
in
various
direction
,
yet
he
always
arrive
at
the
same
spot
at
the
same
hour
--
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
where
he
halt
be
on
the
edge
of
a
dark
wood
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
about
three
mile
from
Rannoch
--
a
good
place
to
get
woodpigeon
,
as
they
come
to
roost
.
<EOS>
It
be
fully
two
mile
across
the
hill
from
the
high
road
to
Moniaive
,
and
from
the
break
the
gray
wall
where
he
be
in
the
habit
of
sit
to
rest
and
smoke
,
there
stretch
the
beautiful
panorama
of
Loch
Urr
and
the
heatherclad
hills
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Leithcourt
never
go
direct
to
the
place
,
but
always
so
time
his
walk
that
he
arrive
just
at
five
,
and
remain
there
smoking
cigarette
until
half
-
past
,
as
though
await
the
arrival
of
some
person
he
expect
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
his
guest
suggest
shooting
pigeon
at
sundown
,
but
he
always
have
some
excuse
for
oppose
the
proposal
,
and
thus
the
party
,
unsuspecte
the
reason
,
be
keep
away
from
that
particular
lonely
spot
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
youth
I
have
sit
many
a
quiet
hour
there
in
the
darkening
gloom
and
shoot
many
a
pigeon
,
therefore
I
know
the
wood
well
,
and
be
able
to
watch
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
from
point
where
he
least
suspect
the
presence
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
when
I
be
alone
with
Muriel
,
I
mention
her
father
's
capacity
for
walk
alone
,
<EOS>
whereupon
she
said--
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
he
be
always
fond
of
walk
.
<EOS>
He
use
to
take
me
with
him
when
we
first
come
here
,
but
he
always
go
so
far
that
I
refuse
to
go
any
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
never
once
mention
Woodroffe
.
<EOS>
I
allow
her
plenty
of
opportunity
for
do
so
,
chaff
her
about
her
forthcoming
marriage
in
order
that
she
may
again
refer
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
never
do
his
name
pass
her
lip
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
he
have
go
abroad
--
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
often
when
alone
I
reflect
upon
my
curious
adventure
on
that
night
when
I
meet
Olinto
,
and
of
my
narrow
escape
from
the
hand
of
my
unknown
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
that
ingenious
and
dastardly
attempt
upon
my
life
have
really
any
connection
with
that
strange
incident
at
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
as
day
succeed
day
,
my
mind
become
fill
by
increase
suspicion
.
<EOS>
mystery
surround
me
on
every
hand
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
by
one
curious
fact
alone
it
be
increase
a
hundredfold
.
 
<EOS>
late
one
afternoon
,
when
I
have
be
out
shoot
all
day
with
the
Rannoch
party
,
I
drive
back
to
the
castle
in
the
Perth
-
cart
with
three
other
man
,
and
find
the
lady
assemble
in
the
great
hall
with
tea
ready
.
<EOS>
a
welcome
log
-
fire
be
blaze
in
the
huge
old
grate
,
for
in
October
it
be
chilly
and
damp
in
Scotland
and
a
fire
be
pleasant
at
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
be
seat
upon
the
high
padded
fender
--
like
those
one
have
at
club
--
which
always
form
a
cosy
spot
for
the
lady
,
especially
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
when
I
enter
,
she
rise
quickly
and
hand
me
my
cup
,
exclaim
as
she
look
at
me--
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
<EOS>
what
a
state
you
be
in
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
after
snipe
,
and
slip
into
a
bog
,
"
I
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
early
this
morning
,
and
the
mud
have
dry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
with
me
,
and
I
will
get
you
a
brush
,
"
she
urge
.
<EOS>
and
I
follow
her
through
the
long
corridor
and
upstairs
to
a
small
sit
-
room
which
be
her
own
little
sanctum
,
where
she
work
and
read
--
a
cosy
little
place
with
two
queer
old
window
in
the
colossal
wall
,
and
a
floor
of
polished
oak
,
and
great
black
beam
above
.
<EOS>
when
the
owner
have
occupy
the
house
that
room
have
be
disuse
,
but
it
have
,
I
find
,
be
now
completely
transform
,
and
be
a
most
tasteful
little
nest
of
luxury
with
its
bright
chintz
,
its
Turkey
rug
and
its
cheerful
fire
on
the
old
stone
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
She
laugh
when
I
express
admiration
of
her
little
den
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
be
the
armory
in
the
old
day
.
<EOS>
but
it
make
quite
a
comfy
little
boudoir
.
<EOS>
I
can
lock
myself
in
and
be
quite
quiet
when
the
party
be
too
noisy
,
"
she
add
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
my
eye
wander
around
they
suddenly
fall
upon
an
object
which
cause
me
to
start
with
profound
wonder
--
a
cabinet
photograph
in
a
frame
of
crimson
leather
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
be
that
of
a
young
girl
--
a
duplicate
of
the
portrait
I
have
find
tear
across
and
fling
aside
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
!
 
<EOS>
the
merry
eye
laugh
out
at
me
as
I
stand
stare
at
it
in
sheer
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
pretty
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
quickly
,
conceal
my
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
My
companion
be
silent
a
moment
,
her
dark
eye
meet
mine
with
a
strange
look
of
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
laugh
,
"
everyone
admire
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
schoolfellow
of
mine
--
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heath
!
"
<EOS>
I
echo
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
she
at
school
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
Chichester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
long
ago
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
little
over
two
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
beautiful
!
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
take
up
the
photograph
and
discover
that
it
bear
the
name
of
the
same
well
-
know
photographer
in
New
Bond
Street
as
that
I
have
find
on
the
carpet
of
the
_
Lola
_
in
the
Mediterranean
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
She
be
really
pretty
than
her
photograph
.
<EOS>
It
hardly
do
her
justice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
she
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
so
very
inquisitive
,
Mr.
Gregg
?
<EOS>
"
laugh
the
handsome
girl
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
actually
fall
in
love
with
her
from
her
picture
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
hardly
give
to
that
kind
of
thing
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
answer
with
mock
severity
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
even
my
bad
enemy
could
call
me
a
flirt
,
could
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
your
due
,
"
she
declare
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
do
flirt
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
like
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
for
your
candor
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
,
"
she
add
,
"
you
seem
smitten
with
Elma
's
charm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
extremely
pretty
,
"
I
remark
,
with
the
photograph
still
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
see
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
since
the
day
I
leave
school
we
have
never
meet
.
<EOS>
She
be
several
year
young
than
myself
,
and
I
hear
that
a
week
after
I
leave
Chichester
<EOS>
her
people
come
and
take
her
away
.
<EOS>
where
she
be
now
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
Her
people
live
somewhere
in
Durham
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
a
doctor
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
reply
disappoint
me
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
,
at
least
,
retained
knowledge
of
the
name
of
the
original
of
the
picture
,
and
from
the
photographer
I
may
perhaps
discover
her
address
,
for
to
me
<EOS>
it
seem
that
she
be
somehow
intimately
connect
with
those
mysterious
yachtsman
.
 
<EOS>
what
Muriel
tell
me
concern
her
,
I
do
not
doubt
for
a
single
instant
.
<EOS>
yet
it
be
certainly
more
than
a
coincidence
that
a
copy
of
the
picture
which
have
create
such
a
deep
impression
upon
me
should
be
preserve
in
her
own
little
boudoir
as
a
souvenir
of
a
devoted
school
-
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
hear
absolutely
nothing
as
to
her
present
position
or
whereabout
--
whether
she
be
married
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
mischievously
.
<EOS>
"
You
betray
yourself
by
your
own
word
.
<EOS>
You
have
fall
in
love
with
her
,
I
really
believe
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
if
she
know
,
she
would
be
most
gratified
--
or
at
least
,
she
ought
to
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
I
smile
,
prefer
that
she
should
adopt
that
theory
in
preference
to
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
speak
frankly
,
as
a
pure
honest
girl
would
speak
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
jealous
,
but
she
nevertheless
resent
--
as
woman
do
resent
such
thing
--
that
I
should
fall
in
love
with
a
friend
's
photograph
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
mystery
surround
that
tear
picture
;
of
that
I
be
absolutely
certain
.
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
that
memorable
evening
when
I
have
dine
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
arise
vividly
before
me
.
<EOS>
why
have
the
girl
's
portrait
be
so
ruthlessly
destroy
and
the
frame
turn
with
its
face
to
the
wall
?
<EOS>
there
be
some
reason
--
some
distinct
and
serious
motive
in
it
.
<EOS>
have
Muriel
tell
me
the
truth
,
I
wonder
,
or
be
she
merely
seek
to
shield
the
suspect
man
who
be
her
lover
?
 
<EOS>
hour
by
hour
<EOS>
the
mystery
surround
the
Leithcourts
become
more
inscrutable
,
more
intensely
absorb
.
<EOS>
I
have
search
a
copy
of
the
London
Directory
at
the
Station
Hotel
at
Carlisle
,
and
find
that
no
house
in
Green
Street
be
register
as
occupy
by
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
;
and
,
further
,
when
I
come
to
examine
the
list
of
guest
at
the
castle
,
I
find
that
they
be
really
person
unknown
in
society
.
<EOS>
They
be
merely
of
that
class
of
witty
,
well
-
dress
parasite
who
always
cling
on
to
the
wealthy
and
make
believe
that
they
be
smart
and
of
the
_
grande
monde
_
.
<EOS>
Rannoch
be
an
expensive
place
to
keep
up
,
with
all
that
big
retinue
of
servant
and
gamekeeper
,
and
with
those
nightly
dinner
cook
by
a
French
_
chef
_
;
yet
Leithcourt
seem
to
possess
a
long
pocket
and
smile
upon
those
parasite
,
officer
of
doubtful
commission
and
young
sprig
of
the
pseudo
-
aristocracy
who
surround
him
,
while
his
wife
,
keen
-
eyed
and
of
superb
bearing
,
be
punctilious
concern
all
point
of
etiquette
,
and
at
the
same
time
indefatigable
that
her
mixed
set
of
guest
should
enjoy
a
really
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
the
only
person
who
could
not
make
them
out
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
the
first
to
open
my
eye
regard
the
true
character
of
certain
of
the
man
stay
at
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Gordon
,
that
one
or
two
of
those
fellow
with
Leithcourt
be
rank
outsider
,
"
he
say
confidentially
to
me
one
night
after
we
have
have
a
hard
day
's
shooting
,
and
be
play
a
hundred
up
at
billiard
before
retire
.
"
<EOS>
one
man
,
who
arrive
yesterday
,
I
know
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
strike
off
the
list
at
Boodle
's
three
year
ago
for
card
-
sharping
--
that
thin
-
faced
,
fair
-
mustached
man
name
Cadby
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Leithcourt
do
not
know
it
,
or
he
would
not
have
him
up
here
among
respectable
folk
.
"
<EOS>
and
my
uncle
,
chew
the
end
of
his
cigar
,
sniff
angrily
,
seem
half
inclined
to
give
his
friend
a
gentle
hint
that
the
name
Cadby
be
place
beyond
the
pale
of
good
society
.
 
<EOS>
"
better
not
say
anything
about
it
,
"
I
urge
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
Leithcourt
's
own
affair
,
uncle
--
not
ours
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
if
a
man
set
up
a
position
in
the
country
he
must
not
be
allow
to
ask
us
to
meet
such
fellow
.
<EOS>
It
be
come
it
a
little
too
thick
,
Gordon
.
<EOS>
We
man
can
stand
the
woman
of
the
party
,
but
the
man
--
well
,
I
tell
you
candidly
,
I
shall
not
accept
his
invite
to
shoot
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
uncle
,
"
I
protest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
probably
it
be
owe
to
ignorance
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
,
a
little
later
on
,
to
give
him
valuable
tip
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
fellow
,
and
only
want
experience
in
Scotland
to
get
along
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
like
it
,
my
boy
,
I
do
not
like
it
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
play
a
fair
game
,
"
declare
the
rigid
old
gentleman
,
color
resentfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
return
the
invitation
and
ask
that
sharp
,
Cadby
,
to
my
house
--
and
I
tell
you
that
plainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
shoot
with
the
carmichael
of
Crossburn
,
and
about
four
o'clock
,
after
a
good
day
,
take
leave
of
the
party
in
the
Black
Glen
,
and
start
off
alone
to
walk
home
,
a
distance
of
about
six
mile
.
<EOS>
It
be
already
grow
dusk
,
and
would
be
quite
dark
,
I
know
,
before
I
reach
my
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
My
most
direct
way
be
to
follow
the
river
for
about
two
mile
and
then
strike
straight
across
the
large
dense
wood
,
and
afterwards
over
a
wide
moor
full
of
treacherous
bog
and
pitfall
for
the
unwary
.
 
<EOS>
My
gun
over
my
shoulder
,
I
have
walk
on
for
about
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
have
nearly
traverse
the
wood
,
at
that
hour
so
dark
that
I
have
considerable
difficulty
in
find
my
way
,
when
--
of
a
sudden
--
I
fancy
I
distinguish
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
halt
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
man
be
talk
in
low
tone
of
confidence
,
and
in
that
calm
stillness
of
evening
they
appear
near
to
me
than
they
actually
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
listen
,
try
to
distinguish
the
word
utter
,
but
could
make
out
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
be
move
slowly
together
,
in
close
vicinity
to
myself
,
for
their
foot
stir
the
dry
leave
,
and
I
could
hear
the
bough
crack
as
they
force
their
way
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
of
a
sudden
,
while
stand
there
not
dare
to
breathe
<EOS>
lest
I
should
betray
my
presence
,
a
strange
sound
fall
upon
my
eager
ear
.
 
<EOS>
next
moment
I
realize
that
I
be
at
that
place
where
Leithcourt
so
persistently
keep
his
disappointed
tryst
,
have
approach
it
from
within
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
the
sound
alarm
me
,
and
yet
it
be
neither
an
explosion
of
fire
-
arm
nor
a
startling
cry
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
one
word
reach
me
in
the
darkness
--
one
single
word
of
bitter
and
wither
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
heedless
of
the
risk
I
run
and
the
peril
to
which
I
expose
myself
,
I
dash
forward
with
a
resolve
to
penetrate
the
mystery
,
until
I
come
to
the
gap
in
the
rough
stone
wall
where
Leithcourt
's
habit
be
to
halt
each
day
at
sundown
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
in
the
fall
darkness
,
the
sight
that
meet
my
eye
at
the
spot
hold
me
rigid
,
appal
,
stupefy
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
instant
I
realize
the
truth
--
a
truth
that
be
surely
the
strange
ever
reveal
to
any
man
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER

certain
<EOS>
confidence
  
<EOS>
as
I
dash
forward
to
the
gap
in
the
boundary

of
the
wood

I
nearly
stumble
over
a
form
lie
across
the
narrow
path
.
 
<EOS>
so
dark
be
it
beneath
the
tree
that
at
first
I
could
not
plainly
make
out
what
it
be
until
I
bend
and
my
hand
touch
the
garment
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
hat
have
fall
off
,
for
I
feel
it
beneath
my
foot
,
while
the
cloak
be
a
thick
woolen
one
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
dead
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
that
cry
--
that
single
word
of
reproach
--
sound
in
my
ear
,
and
it
seem
plain
that
she
have
be
strike
down
ruthlessly
after
an
exchange
of
angry
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
in
my
pocket
for
my
vestas
,
but
unfortunately
my
box
be
empty
.
<EOS>
yet
just
at
that
moment
my
strained
ear
catch
a
sound
--
the
sound
of
someone
move
stealthily
among
the
fall
leave
.
<EOS>
seize
my
gun
,
I
demand
who
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
no
response
.
<EOS>
the
instant
I
speak
the
movement
cease
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
could
judge
,
the
person
in
concealment
be
within
the
wood
about
ten
yard
from
me
,
separate
by
an
impenetrable
thicket
.
<EOS>
as
,
however
,
I
stand
out
against
the
sky
,
my
silhouette
be
,
I
know
,
a
well
-
define
mark
for
anyone
with
fire
-
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
evident
that
a
tragedy
have
occur
,
and
that
the
victim
at
my
foot
be
a
woman
.
<EOS>
but
whom
?
 
<EOS>
of
a
sudden
,
while
I
stand
hesitate
,
blame
myself
for
be
without
match
,
I
hear
the
movement
repeat
.
<EOS>
someone
be
quickly
recede
--
escape
from
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
listen
again
.
<EOS>
the
sound
be
not
of
the
rustling
of
leave
or
the
crackling
of
dry
stick
,
but
the
low
thud
of
a
man
's
foot
race
over
soft
ground
.
<EOS>
He
have
scale
the
rough
stone
dyke
and
be
out
in
the
turnip
-
field
adjacent
.
 
<EOS>
I
spring
through
the
gap
,
strain
my
eye
into
the
gloom
,
and
as
I
do
so
could
just
distinguish
a
dark
figure
recede
quickly
beneath
the
wall
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
I
dash
after
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
agility
of
whoever
the
fugitive
be
,
man
or
woman
,
be
marvelous
.
<EOS>
I
consider
myself
a
fairly
good
runner
,
but
race
across
those
rough
turnip
and
heavy
,
newly
-
plow
land
in
the
darkness
and
carry
my
gun
soon
cause
me
to
pant
and
blow
.
<EOS>
yet
the
figure
I
be
pursue
be
so
fleet
of
foot
and
so
nimble
in
climb
the
high
rough
wall
that
from
the
very
first
I
be
outrun
.
 
<EOS>
down
the
steep
hill
to
the
Scarwater
<EOS>
I
follow
the
fugitive
,
cross
the
old
footbridge
near
Penpont
,
and
then
up
a
wild
winding
glen
towards
the
Cairnsmore
of
Deugh
.
<EOS>
for
a
couple
of
mile
or
more
I
be
close
behind
,
until
,
at
a
turn
in
the
dark
woode
glen
where
it
branch
in
two
direction
,
I
lose
all
trace
of
the
person
who
fly
from
me
.
<EOS>
whoever
it
be
they
have
very
cleverly
go
into
hiding
in
the
undergrowth
of
one
or
other
of
the
two
glen
--
which
I
could
not
decide
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
out
of
breath
,
the
perspiration
pour
from
me
,
undecide
how
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
it
Leithcourt
himself
whom
I
have
surprise
?
 
<EOS>
that
idea
somehow
become
impressed
upon
me
and
I
suddenly
resolve
to
go
boldly
across
to
Rannoch
and
ascertain
for
myself
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
with
the
excuse
that
I
be
belate
on
my
walk
home
,
I
turn
back
down
the
glen
,
and
half
an
hour
afterward
enter
the
great
well
-
light
hall
of
the
castle
where
the
guest
,
ready
dress
,
be
assemble
prior
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
welcome
warmly
,
as
I
be
always
by
the
man
of
the
party
,
who
see
my
muddy
plight
at
once
offer
me
a
glass
of
the
sportsman
's
drink
in
Scotland
,
and
while
I
be
add
soda
to
it
<EOS>
Leithcourt
himself
join
his
guest
,
ready
dress
in
his
dinner
jacket
,
have
just
descend
from
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
Gregg
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
heartily
,
hold
out
his
hand
.
"
<EOS>
have
a
long
day
of
it
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
good
sport
with
Carmichael
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
fair
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
remain
longer
with
him
than
I
ought
to
have
do
,
and
have
get
belate
on
my
way
home
,
so
look
in
for
a
refresher
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
quite
right
,
"
he
laugh
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
always
welcome
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
be
annoy
if
I
know
you
have
pass
without
come
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
Muriel
,
a
pretty
figure
in
a
low
-
cut
gown
of
turquoise
chiffon
,
stand
behind
her
father
,
smile
secretly
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
smile
at
her
in
return
,
but
it
be
a
strange
smile
,
I
fear
,
for
with
the
knowledge
of
that
additional
mystery
within
me
--
the
mystery
of
the
woman
lie
unconscious
or
perhaps
dead
,
up
in
the
wood
--
hold
me
stupefy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suspect
Leithcourt
because
of
his
constant
tryst
at
that
spot
,
but
I
have
at
least
prove
that
my
suspicion
be
entirely
without
foundation
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
get
home
and
dress
in
the
time
,
for
I
have
take
the
near
route
to
the
castle
while
the
fugitive
would
be
compel
to
make
a
wide
detour
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
remain
a
few
minute
,
then
go
forth
into
the
darkness
again
,
utterly
undecided
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
be
to
return
to
the
woman
's
aid
,
for
she
may
not
be
dead
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
when
I
recollect
that
hoarse
cry
that
ring
out
in
the
darkness
,
I
know
too
well
that
she
have
be
strike
fatally
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
latter
conviction
that
prevent
me
from
turn
back
to
the
wood
.
<EOS>
You
will
perhaps
blame
me
,
but
the
fact
be
I
fear
that
if
I
go
there
suspicion
may
fall
upon
me
,
now
that
the
real
culprit
have
so
ingeniously
escape
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
victim
be
dead
,
what
aid
could
I
render
?
<EOS>
a
knife
have
,
I
believe
,
be
use
,
for
my
foot
catch
against
it
when
I
have
start
off
after
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
the
only
doubt
in
my
own
mind
be
whether
the
unfortunate
woman
be
actually
dead
,
for
if
she
be
not
then
my
disinclination
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
be
culpable
.
 
<EOS>
whether
or
not
I
act
rightly
in
remain
away
from
the
place
,
I
leave
it
to
you
to
judge
in
the
light
of
the
amazing
truth
which
afterwards
transpire
.
 
<EOS>
I
decide
to
walk
straight
back
to
my
uncle
's
,
and
dinner
be
over
before
I
have
have
my
tub
and
dressed
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
eat
my
meal
alone
,
Davis
,
the
grave
old
butler
,
serve
me
with
that
stateliness
which
always
amuse
me
.
<EOS>
I
usually
chat
with
him
when
other
be
not
present
,
but
that
night
I
remain
silent
,
my
mind
full
of
that
strange
and
startling
affair
of
which
I
alone
hold
secret
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
the
body
would
surely
be
find
;
then
the
whole
countryside
would
be
fill
with
horror
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
Leithcourt
,
that
calm
,
well
-
groom
,
distinguish
-
looking
man
,
hold
any
knowledge
of
the
ghastly
truth
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
His
manner
as
he
stand
in
the
hall
chat
gayly
with
me
be
surely
not
that
of
a
man
with
a
guilty
secret
.
<EOS>
I
become
firmly
convinced
<EOS>
that
although
the
tragedy
affect
him
very
closely
,
and
that
it
have
occur
at
the
spot
which
he
have
each
day
visit
for
some
mysterious
purpose
,
yet
up
to
the
present
he
be
in
ignorance
of
what
have
transpire
.
 
<EOS>
but
who
be
the
woman
?
<EOS>
be
she
young
or
old
?
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
time
I
regret
bitterly
that
I
have
no
match
with
me
so
that
I
may
examine
her
feature
.
 
<EOS>
one
sudden
thought
that
strike
me
as
I
sit
there
at
table
cause
me
to
lay
down
my
fork
and
pause
in
breathless
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
be
the
victim
that
sweet
-
faced
young
girl
whose
photograph
have
be
so
ruthlessly
cast
from
its
frame
and
destroy
?
<EOS>
the
theory
be
a
weird
one
,
but
be
it
the
truth
?
 
<EOS>
I
long
for
the
coming
of
the
dawn
when
the
Rannoch
keeper
would
most
certainly
discover
her
.
<EOS>
then
at
least
I
should
know
the
truth
,
for
I
may
go
and
see
the
body
out
of
curiosity
without
arouse
any
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
play
my
usual
game
of
billiard
with
my
uncle
,
but
my
hand
be
so
unsteady
that
the
old
gentleman
begin
to
chaff
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
gun
,
I
suppose
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
carry
it
all
day
,
and
be
tired
out
.
<EOS>
I
walk
all
the
way
home
from
Crossburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
carmichael
be
very
thick
with
the
Leithcourts
,
I
hear
,
"
my
uncle
remark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
strange
they
do
not
ask
Leithcourt
to
their
shoot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
do
,
but
he
would
get
another
engagement
--
over
at
Kenmure
Castle
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
retire
to
my
room
that
night
full
of
fevered
apprehension
.
<EOS>
have
I
act
rightly
in
not
return
to
that
lonely
spot
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
?
<EOS>
have
I
do
as
a
man
should
do
in
keep
the
tragic
secret
to
myself
?
 
<EOS>
I
open
my
window
and
gaze
away
across
the
dark
Nithsdale
,
where
,
in
the
distant
gloom
,
the
black
line
of
wood
loom
up
against
the
stormy
sky
.
<EOS>
the
star
be
no
longer
shine
and
the
rain
cloud
have
gather
.
<EOS>
I
stand
with
my
face
turn
to
the
dark
indistinct
spot
that
hold
the
secret
,
lose
in
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
close
the
window
and
turn
in
,
but
no
sleep
come
to
my
eye
,
so
full
be
my
mind
of
the
startling
event
of
those
past
few
month
and
of
that
gruesome
discovery
I
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
have
the
fugitive
actually
recognize
me
?
<EOS>
probably
my
voice
when
I
have
call
out
have
betray
me
.
<EOS>
hour
after
hour
I
lay
puzzle
,
try
to
arrive
at
some
solution
of
that
intricate
problem
which
now
present
itself
.
<EOS>
Muriel
could
tell
me
what
I
wish
to
know
.
<EOS>
of
that
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
yet
she
dare
not
speak
.
<EOS>
some
inexpressible
terror
hold
her
dumb
--
she
be
affiance
to
the
man
Martin
Woodroffe
.
 
<EOS>
again
I
rise
,
light
the
gas
,
and
try
to
read
a
novel
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
concentrate
my
thought
,
which
be
ever
wander
to
that
strange
mystery
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
at
six
I
shave
,
descend
,
and
go
out
with
the
dog
for
a
short
walk
;
but
on
return
I
hear
of
nothing
unusual
,
and
be
compel
to
remain
inactive
until
near
mid
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
cross
the
stable
-
yard
where
I
have
go
to
order
the
carriage
for
my
aunt
,
when
an
English
groom
,
suddenly
emerge
from
the
harness
-
room
,
touch
his
cap
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
'
eard
,
sir
,
of
the
awful
affair
up
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
what
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
there
seem
to
have
be
a
murder
last
night
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
"
say
the
man
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Holden
,
the
gardener
,
have
just
come
back
from
that
village
and
say
that
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
under
-
gamekeeper
as
he
be
go
home
at
five
this
morning
come
upon
a
dead
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
dead
body
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
feign
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
--
a
youngish
man
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
stab
to
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
--
so
Holden
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
call
Holden
.
<EOS>
I
would
like
to
know
all
he
be
hear
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
and
presently
,
when
the
gardener
emerge
from
the
grape
-
house
,
I
seek
of
him
all
the
particular
he
have
gather
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
very
much
,
sir
,
"
be
the
man
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
into
the
inn
for
a
glass
of
beer
at
eleven
,
as
I
always
do
,
and
hear
them
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
a
young
man
be
murder
last
night
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
<EOS>
the
gamekeeper
think
at
first
there
have
be
a
fight
among
poacher
,
but
from
the
dead
man
's
clothe
they
say
he
be
not
a
poacher
at
all
,
but
a
stranger
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
body
be
that
of
a
man
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
try
to
conceal
my
utter
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
about
thirty
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
the
police
have
take
him
to
the
mortuary
at
dumfrie
,
and
the
detective
be
up
there
now
look
at
the
spot
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
a
man
!
<EOS>
and
yet
the
body
I
find
be
that
of
a
woman
--
that
I
could
swear
.
 
<EOS>
after
lunch
I
take
the
dog
-
cart
and
drive
alone
into
dumfrie
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
inquire
of
the
police
-
constable
on
duty
at
the
town
mortuary
to
be
allow
to
view
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
,
he
regard
me
,
I
think
,
with
considerable
suspicion
.
<EOS>
My
request
be
an
unusual
one
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
take
me
up
a
narrow
alley
,
unlock
a
door
,
and
I
find
myself
in
the
cold
,
gloomy
chamber
of
death
.
<EOS>
from
a
small
dingy
window
above
the
light
fall
upon
an
object
lie
upon
a
large
slab
of
gray
stone
and
cover
with
a
soiled
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
be
ghastly
and
gruesome
;
the
body
lie
there
await
the
official
inquiry
into
the
cause
of
death
.
<EOS>
the
silence
of
the
tomb
be
unbroken
,
save
for
the
heavy
tread
of
the
policeman
,
who
have
remove
his
helmet
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
,
lift
the
end
of
the
sheet
,
reveal
to
me
a
white
,
hard
-
set
face
,
with
closed
eye
and
drop
jaw
.
 
<EOS>
I
start
back
as
my
eye
fall
upon
the
dead
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
be
entirely
unprepared
for
such
a
revelation
.
<EOS>
the
truth
stagger
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
victim
be
the
man
who
have
act
as
my
friend
--
the
italian
waiter
,
Olinto
.
 
<EOS>
I
advance
and
peer
into
the
thin
inanimate
feature
,
scarce
able
to
realize
the
actual
fact
.
<EOS>
but
my
eye
have
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
though
death
distort
the
facial
expression
of
every
man
,
I
have
no
difficulty
in
identify
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recognize
him
,
sir
?
"
remark
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
he
?
<EOS>
Our
people
be
very
anxious
to
know
,
for
up
to
the
present
moment
they
have
not
succeed
in
establish
his
identity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
bite
my
lip
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
an
arrant
fool
to
betray
myself
before
that
man
.
<EOS>
yet
have
do
so
,
I
see
that
any
attempt
to
conceal
my
knowledge
must
of
necessity
reflect
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
your
inspector
,
"
I
answer
with
as
much
calmness
as
I
could
muster
.
<EOS>
"
where
have
the
poor
fellow
be
wound
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
through
the
heart
,
"
respond
the
constable
,
as
turn
the
sheet
further
down
<EOS>
he
show
me
the
small
knife
wound
which
have
penetrate
the
victim
's
jacket
and
vest
full
in
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
weapon
,
"
he
add
,
take
from
a
shelf
close
by
a
long
,
thin
poignard
with
an
ivory
handle
,
which
he
hand
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
I
recognize
what
it
be
,
and
how
deadly
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
Florentine
_
misericordia
_
,
a
long
thin
,
triangular
blade
,
a
quarter
of
an
inch
wide
at
its
great
width
,
taper
to
a
needle
-
point
,
with
a
hilt
of
yellow
ivory
,
the
most
deadly
and
fatal
of
all
the
dagger
and
poignard
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
<EOS>
the
blade
be
sharp
on
three
angle
produce
a
wound
that
cause
internal
hemorrhage
and
which
never
heal
--
hence
the
name
give
to
it
by
the
Florentines
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
still
blood
-
stain
,
but
as
I
take
the
deadly
thing
in
my
hand
I
see
that
its
blade
be
beautifully
damascene
,
a
most
elegant
speciman
of
a
medieval
arm
.
<EOS>
yet
surely
none
but
an
Italian
would
use
such
a
weapon
,
or
would
aim
so
truly
as
to
penetrate
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
the
person
strike
down
be
a
woman
,
and
not
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
a
wound
from
a
_
misericordia
_
always
prove
fatal
,
because
the
shape
of
the
blade
cut
the
flesh
into
little
flap
which
,
on
withdraw
the
knife
,
close
up
and
prevent
the
blood
from
issue
forth
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
no
power
can
make
them
heal
again
.
<EOS>
a
blow
from
such
a
weapon
be
as
surely
fatal
as
the
poison
poignard
of
the
Borgia
or
the
Medici
.
 
<EOS>
I
hand
the
stiletto
back
to
the
man
without
comment
.
<EOS>
My
resolve
be
to
say
as
little
as
possible
,
for
I
have
no
desire
to
figure
publicly
at
the
inquiry
,
and
consequently
negative
all
my
own
effort
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
Leithcourts
and
of
Martin
Woodroffe
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
to
where
the
figure
be
lie
so
ghastly
and
motionless
,
and
look
again
for
the
last
time
upon
the
dead
face
of
the
man
who
have
serve
me
so
well
,
and
yet
who
have
entice
me
so
nearly
to
my
death
.
<EOS>
in
the
latter
incident
there
be
a
deep
mystery
.
<EOS>
He
have
relent
at
the
last
moment
,
just
in
time
to
save
me
from
my
secret
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
my
enemy
be
his
?
<EOS>
have
he
fall
a
victim
by
the
same
hand
that
have
attempt
so
ingeniously
to
kill
me
?
 
<EOS>
why
have
Leithcourt
go
so
regularly
up
to
Rannoch
Wood
?
<EOS>
be
it
in
order
to
meet
the
man
who
be
to
be
entrap
and
kill
?
<EOS>
what
be
Olinto
Santini
do
so
far
from
London
,
if
he
have
not
come
expressly
to
meet
someone
in
secret
?
 
<EOS>
as
I
glance
down
at
the
cold
,
inanimate
countenance
upon
which
mystery
be
write
,
I
become
seize
by
regret
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
faithful
and
honest
servant
,
and
even
though
he
have
entice
me
to
that
fatal
house
in
Lambeth
,
yet
I
recollect
his
word
,
how
he
have
do
so
under
compulsion
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
too
,
how
he
have
implore
me
not
to
prejudge
him
before
I
become
aware
of
the
full
fact
.
 
<EOS>
with
my
own
hand
I
re
-
cover
the
face
with
the
sheet
,
and
inwardly
resolve
to
avenge
the
dastardly
crime
.
 
<EOS>
I
regret
that
I
be
compel
to
reveal
the
dead
man
's
name
to
the
police
,
yet
I
see
that
to
make
some
statement
be
now
inevitable
,
and
therefore
I
accompany
the
constable
to
the
inspector
's
office
some
distance
across
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
have
be
introduce
to
the
big
,
fair
-
haired
man
in
a
rough
tweed
suit
,
who
be
apparently
direct
the
inquiry
into
the
affair
,
he
take
me
eagerly
into
a
small
back
room
and
begin
to
question
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
wary
not
to
commit
myself
to
anything
further
than
the
identification
of
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
"
I
say
confidentially
,
"
you
must
omit
me
from
the
witness
at
the
inquest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
detective
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
if
it
be
know
that
I
have
identify
him
,
all
chance
of
get
at
the
truth
will
at
once
vanish
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
to
tell
you
in
strict
confidence
who
the
poor
fellow
really
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
know
something
of
the
affair
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
,
with
a
strong
Highland
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
,
"
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
except
his
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
h'm
.
<EOS>
and
you
say
he
be
a
foreigner
--
an
italian
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
my
service
in
Leghorn
for
several
year
,
and
on
leave
me
he
come
to
London
and
obtain
an
engagement
as
waiter
in
a
restaurant
.
<EOS>
His
father
live
in
Leghorn
;
he
be
doorkeeper
at
the
Prefecture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
be
he
here
,
in
Scotland
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
tell
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
something
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
mean
that
you
suspect
somebody
,
or
you
would
have
no
objection
to
give
evidence
at
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
suspicion
.
<EOS>
to
me
the
affair
be
just
as
much
of
an
enigma
as
to
you
,
<EOS>
"
I
hasten
at
once
to
explain
.
<EOS>
"
My
only
fear
be
that
if
the
assassin
know
that
I
have
identify
him
he
would
take
care
not
to
betray
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
therefore
think
he
will
betray
himself
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
the
fact
that
the
man
be
attack
with
an
italian
stiletto
,
it
would
seem
that
his
assailant
be
a
fellow
-
countryman
,
"
suggest
the
detective
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
evidence
certainly
point
to
that
,
"
I
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
happen
to
be
aware
of
anyone
--
any
foreigner
,
I
mean
--
who
be
,
or
may
be
his
enemy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
respond
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
these
foreigner
be
always
fight
among
themselves
and
use
knife
.
<EOS>
I
do
ten
year
'
service
in
Edinburgh
and
make
lot
of
arrest
for
stab
affray
.
<EOS>
Italians
,
like
Greeks
,
be
a
dangerous
lot
when
their
blood
be
up
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
add
:
"
personally
,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
murdered
man
be
entice
from
London
to
that
spot
and
coolly
do
away
with
--
from
some
motive
of
revenge
,
most
probably
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
probably
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
a
vendetta
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
live
in
Italy
,
and
therefore
know
the
Italians
well
,
"
I
add
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
him
my
card
,
and
tell
him
with
whom
I
be
stay
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
yesterday
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
presently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
shoot
--
on
the
other
side
of
the
Nithsdale
,
"
I
answer
,
and
then
go
on
to
explain
my
movement
,
without
,
however
,
mention
my
visit
to
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
although
you
know
the
murder
man
so
intimately
,
you
have
no
suspicion
of
anyone
in
this
district
who
be
acquaint
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
one
who
know
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
my
service
he
have
never
be
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
he
be
engage
in
service
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
at
a
restaurant
in
Oxford
Street
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
meet
him
accidentally
in
Pall
Mall
one
evening
,
and
he
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
restaurant
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
tell
me
,
but
unfortunately
I
have
forget
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
detective
draw
a
deep
breath
of
regret
.
 
<EOS>
"
someone
who
wait
for
him
on
the
edge
of
that
wood
step
out
and
kill
him
--
that
be
evident
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
without
a
doubt
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
my
belief
be
that
it
be
an
Italian
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
foreigner
who
sleep
at
a
common
lodging
-
house
two
night
ago
and
go
on
tramp
towards
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
We
have
telegraph
after
them
,
and
hope
we
shall
find
them
.
<EOS>
scotsman
or
Englishmen
never
use
a
knife
of
that
pattern
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
his
latter
remark
I
entirely
coincide
.
<EOS>
in
my
own
mind
that
be
the
strong
argument
in
favor
of
Leithcourt
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
that
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
have
keep
that
secret
tryst
in
daily
patience
I
know
from
my
own
observation
,
yet
to
me
it
scarcely
seem
feasible
that
he
would
use
a
weapon
so
peculiarly
italian
and
yet
so
terribly
deadly
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
when
I
reflect
further
,
recollect
that
the
body
I
have
discover
be
that
of
a
woman
and
not
a
man
,
I
stand
staggered
and
bewilder
by
the
utterly
inexplicable
enigma
.
 
<EOS>
I
promise
the
burly
detective
<EOS>
that
in
exchange
for
his
secrecy
regard
my
statement
that
I
would
assist
him
in
every
manner
possible
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
real
name
of
the
murder
man
must
be
at
all
cost
withhold
,
"
I
urge
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
not
appear
in
the
paper
,
for
I
feel
confident
that
only
by
the
pretense
that
he
be
unknown
can
we
arrive
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
if
his
name
be
give
at
the
inquiry
,
then
the
assassin
will
certainly
know
that
I
have
identify
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
with
some
hesitation
,
"
while
I
be
believe
to
be
in
ignorance
we
shall
have
opportunity
for
obtain
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
do
really
suspect
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
,
again
look
at
me
with
those
cold
,
blue
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
whom
to
suspect
,
"
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mystery
why
the
man
who
be
once
my
faithful
servant
should
be
entice
to
that
wood
and
stab
to
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
one
in
the
vicinity
who
know
him
?
"
 
"
not
to
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
obtain
his
address
in
London
through
his
father
in
Leghorn
,
"
suggest
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
-
day
if
you
so
desire
,
"
I
say
readily
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
will
get
my
friend
the
British
Consul
to
go
round
and
see
the
old
man
and
telegraph
the
address
if
he
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
capital
!
"
<EOS>
he
declare
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
do
us
this
favor
we
shall
be
greatly
indebted
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
that
we
have
establish
the
victim
's
identity
--
otherwise
we
may
be
entirely
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
a
murdered
foreigner
be
always
more
or
less
of
a
mystery
.
"
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
then
and
there
,
I
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
write
to
my
old
friend
Hutcheson
at
Leghorn
,
ask
him
to
make
immediate
inquiry
of
Olinto
's
father
as
to
his
son
's
address
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
to
the
police
of
that
strange
adventure
of
mine
over
in
Lambeth
,
or
of
how
the
man
now
dead
have
save
my
life
.
<EOS>
that
his
enemy
be
my
own
<EOS>
he
have
most
distinctly
tell
me
,
therefore
I
feel
some
apprehension
that
I
myself
be
not
safe
.
<EOS>
yet
in
my
hip
pocket
I
always
carry
my
revolver
--
just
as
I
do
in
Italy
--
and
I
rather
pride
myself
on
my
ability
to
shoot
straight
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
for
a
long
time
discuss
the
strange
affair
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
betray
no
eagerness
to
get
away
,
I
offer
the
big
Highlander
a
cigar
from
my
case
,
and
we
smoke
together
.
<EOS>
the
inquiry
would
be
hold
on
the
morrow
,
he
tell
me
,
but
as
far
as
the
public
be
concern
the
body
would
remain
as
that
of
some
person
"
unknown
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
well
not
come
to
my
uncle
's
house
,
or
send
anyone
,
"
I

"
if
you
desire
to
see
me
,
send
me
a
line

I
will
meet
you
here
in

<EOS>
It
will
be
safe

"
 
<EOS>
the
officer
look
at
me
with
those
keen
eye
of
his
,
and
say
:
 
"
really
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
I
can
not
quite
make
you
out
,
I
confess
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
be
apprehensive
of
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Italians
be
a
very
curious
people
,
"
I
respond
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Their
vendetta
extend
widely
sometimes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
enemy
of
this
poor
fellow
Santini
may
be
your
enemy
also
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
one
never
know
whom
one
offend
when
live
in
Italy
,
"
I
laugh
,
as
lightly
as
I
could
,
endeavor
to
allay
his
suspicion
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
have
fall
beneath
the
assassin
's
knife
by
give
quite
a
small
and
possibly
innocent
offense
to
somebody
.
<EOS>
italian
method
be
not
English
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
Jove
,
sir
,
and
I
be
jolly
glad
they
be
not
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
think
a
police
officer
's
life
be
a
very
safe
one
among
all
those
secret
murder
society
I
have
read
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
what
you
read
about
them
be
often
very
much
exaggerated
,
"
I
assure
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
vendetta
which
be
such
a
stain
upon
the
character
of
the
modern
Italian
;
and
depend
upon
it
this
affair
in
Rannoch
Wood
be
the
outcome
of
some
revenge
or
other
--
probably
over
a
love
affair
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
assist
us
,
sir
?
"
he
urge
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
italian
language
,
which
will
be
of
great
advantage
;
besides
,
the
victim
be
your
servant

"
 
<EOS>
"
be
discreet
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
in
return
I
will
do
my
very
utmost
to
assist
you
in
hunt
down
the
assassin
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
thus
we
make
our
compact
.
<EOS>
half
-
an
-
hour
after
I
be
drive
in
the
dog
-
cart
through
the
pour
rain
up
the
hill
out
of
gray
old
dumfrie
to
my
uncle
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
descend
from
the
cart
and
give
it
over
to
a
groom
,
old
Davis
,
the
butler
,
come
forward
,
say
in
a
low
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
Miss
Leithcourt
wait
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Gordon
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
morning
-
room
,
and
be
there
an
hour
.
<EOS>
She
ask
me
not
to
tell
anyone
else
<EOS>
she
be
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
my
aunt
have
not
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
scent
mystery
in
this
unexpected
visit
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
wish
to
see
you
alone
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
walk
across
the
big
hall
and
along
the
corridor
to
the
room
the
old
man
have
indicate
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
open
the
door
and
Muriel
Leithcourt
in
plain
black
rise
to
meet
me
<EOS>
,
I
plainly
see
from
her
white
,
haggard
countenance
that
something
have
happen
--
that
she
have
be
force
by
circumstance
to
come
to
me
in
strict
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
about
to
reveal
to
me
the
truth
?
    
CHAPTER
VI
 
<EOS>
the
gathering
of
the
cloud
  
"
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
exclaim
the
girl
with
agitation
,
as
she
put
forth
her
black
-
gloved
hand
,
"
I
--
I
suppose
you
know
--
you've
hear
all
about
the
discovery
to
-
day
up
at
the
wood
?
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
anything
about
it
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
I
only
wish
you
would
tell
me
about
it
,
"
I
say
gravely
,
invite
her
to
a
chair
and
seat
myself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
some
extraordinary
story
about
a
man
be
find
dead
,
but
I
have
be
in
dumfrie
nearly
all
day
.
<EOS>
who
be
the
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
that
we
do
not
know
,
"
she
reply
,
pale
-
faced
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
Her
attitude
be
as
though
she
wish
to
confide
in
me
and
yet
still
hesitate
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
wait
for
me
quite
a
long
time
,
Davis
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
you
should
have
do
this
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
leave
word
that
you
wish
to
see
me
,
I
would
have
come
over
to
you
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
I
want
to
see
you
alone
--
that
be
the
reason
I
be
here
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
know
at
home
that
I
have
be
over
here
,
so
I
purposely
ask
the
man
not
to
announce
me
to
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
see
me
privately
,
"
I
say
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
be
there
any
service
I
can
render
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
a
very
great
one
,
"
she
respond
with
quick
eagerness
,
"
I
--
<EOS>
well
--
the
fact
be
,
I
have
summon
courage
to
come
to
you
and
beg
of
you
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
great
distress
--
and
I
have
not
a
single
friend
whom
I
can
trust
--
in
whom
I
can
confide
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
esteem
it
the
high
honor
if
you
will
trust
me
,
"
I
say
in
deep
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
assure
you
that
I
will
remain
loyal
to
your
interest
and
to
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
believe
you
will
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
<EOS>
"
she
declare
with
enthusiasm
,
her
large
,
dark
eye
turn
upon
me
--
the
eye
of
a
woman
in
sheer
and
bitter
despair
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
perfect
,
one
of
the
most
handsome
I
have
ever
gaze
upon
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
of
her
<EOS>
the
great
be
the
fascination
she
hold
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
a
silence
fall
between
us
as
she
sit
with
her
gloved
hand
lie
idly
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
Her
lip
move
nervously
,
but
no
sound
come
from
them
,
<EOS>
so
agitated
be
she
,
so
eager
to
tell
me
something
;
and
yet
at
the
same
time
reluctant
to
take
me
into
her
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
at
last
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
ready
to
render
you
any
service
,
if
you
will
only
command
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
I
fear
what
I
require
will
strike
you
as
so
unusual
--
you
will
hesitate
to
act
when
I
explain
what
service
<EOS>
I
require
of
you
,
"
she
say
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
until
I
hear
your
wish
,
"
I
say
,
smile
,
and
yet
puzzle
at
her
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
concern
the
terrible
discovery
make
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
"
she
say
in
a
hoarse
,
nervous
voice
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
that
unknown
man
be
murder
--
stab
to
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
she
say
,
scarcely
above
a
whisper
,
"
I
have
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
the
murdered
man
's
identity
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
of
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
glance
at
her
sharply
and
see
the
intense
look
in
her
dark
,
wide
-
open
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
believe
you
know
who
deal
the
blow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
suspicion
--
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
only
I
want
you
to
help
me
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
certainly
,
"
I
respond
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
believe
you
know
the
assassin
you
probably
know
something
of
the
victim
?
"
 
"
only
that
he
look
like
a
foreigner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
see
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
much
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
My
remark
cause
her
to
hold
her
breath
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
then
she
answer
,
rather
lamely
,
it
seem
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
when
the
keeper
bring
the
body
to
the
castle
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
,
accord
to
the
account
I
have
hear
,
the
police
have
convey
the
dead
man
direct
from
the
wood
into
dumfrie
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
,
therefore
,
that
she
have
see
Olinto
before
he
meet
with
his
sudden
end
?
 
<EOS>
I
fear
to
press
her
for
an
explanation
at
that
moment
,
but
,
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
admission
that
she
have
see
him
strike
me
as
a
very
peculiar
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
judge
him
to
be
a
foreigner
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
as
casually
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
his
feature
and
complexion
I
guess
him
to
be
italian
,
"
she
respond
quickly
,
at
which
I
pretend
to
express
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
after
the
keeper
have
find
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
the
stiletto
be
evidently
an
italian
one
,
which
would
almost
make
it
appear
that
a
foreigner
be
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
your
own
suspicion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
hesitate
a
moment
,
then
in
a
low
,
eager
voice
she
say
:
 
"
because
I
have
already
see
that
three
-
edge
knife
in
another
person
's
possession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
pretty
strong
evidence
,
"
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
the
person
in
question
will
have
to
prove
that
he
be
not
in
Rannoch
Wood
last
evening
at
nightfall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
it
be
do
at
nightfall
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
quickly
with
some
surprise
,
half
-
rise
from
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
merely
surmise
that
it
be
,
"
I
respond
,
inwardly
blame
myself
for
my
ill
-
time
admission
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
with
a
slight
sigh
,
"
there
be
more
mystery
in
this
affair
than
we
have
yet
discover
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
bring
the
unfortunate
young
man
up
into
our
wood
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
an
appointment
,
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
with
whom
?
"
 
She
shake
her
head
,
say
:
 
"
My
father
often
go
to
that
spot
to
shoot
pigeon
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
so
at
luncheon
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
how
fortunate
he
be
not
there
last
night
,
or
he
may
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
,
for
it
can
not
be
a
pleasant
experience
to
be
under
suspicion
of
be
an
assassin
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
home
last
night
,
be
he
?
"
<EOS>
I
add
casually
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
recollect
that
when
you
call
he
chat
with
you
?
<EOS>
I
do
some
typewrite
for
him
in
the
study
,
and
we
be
together
all
the
afternoon
--
or
at
least
till
nearly
five
o'clock
,
when
we
go
out
into
the
hall
to
tea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
be
your
theory
regard
the
affair
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
rather
puzzle
why
she
should
so
decisively
prove
an
alibi
for
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
certain
that
the
poor
fellow
go
to
the
wood
by
appointment
,
and
be
kill
.
<EOS>
but
have
you
be
up
to
the
spot
since
the
finding
of
the
body
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
have
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
the
affair
interest
me
,
and
as
soon
as
I
recognize
the
old
italian
knife
in
the
hand
of
the
keeper
,
I
go
up
there
and
look
about
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
do
so
,
for
I
find
something
which
seem
to
have
escape
the
notice
of
the
detective
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
about
three
yard
from
the
pool
of
blood
where
the
unfortunate
foreigner
be
find
be
another
small
pool
of
blood
where
the
grass
and
fern
around
be
all
crush
down
as
though
there
have
be
a
struggle
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
may
have
be
a
struggle
at
that
spot
,
and
the
man
may
have
stagger
some
distance
before
he
fall
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
if
he
have
be
strike
in
the
heart
,
as
they
say
.
<EOS>
He
would
fall
,
would
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
suggest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
the
police
seem
very
dense
,
and
this
plain
fact
have
not
yet
occur
to
them
.
<EOS>
Their
theory
be
the
same
as
what
you
suggest
,
but
my
own
be
something
quite
different
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
a
second
person
also
fall
a
victim
,
"
she
add
in
a
low
,
distinct
tone
.
 
<EOS>
I
gaze
at
her
open
-
mouthed
.
<EOS>
do
she
,
I
wonder
,
know
the
actual
truth
?
<EOS>
be
she
aware
that
the
woman
who
have
fall
there
have
disappear
?
 
<EOS>
"
a
second
person
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
echo
,
as
though
in
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
then
do
you
believe
that
a
double
murder
be
commit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
draw
my
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
the
young
man
,
on
be
strike
in
the
heart
,
could
not
have
go
such
a
distance
as
that
which
separate
the
one
mark
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
may
have
be
slightly
wound
--
on
the
hand
,
or
in
the
face
--
at
first
,
and
then
at
the
spot
where
he
be
find
strike
fatally
,
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
dubiously
,
but
make
no
reply
to
my
argument
.
<EOS>
Her
confidence
in
her
own
surmise
make
it
quite
apparent
that
by
some
unknown
mean
she
be
aware
of
the
second
victim
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
a
few
moment
later
she
say
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
this
reason
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
that
I
have
seek
you
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
nobody
must
know
that
I
have
come
here
to
you
,
or
they
would
suspect
;
and
if
suspicion
fall
upon
me
it
would
bring
upon
me
a
fate
bad
than
death
.
<EOS>
remember
,
therefore
,
that
my
future
be
entirely
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
,
"
I
say
,
rise
and
stand
before
her
in
the
fade
twilight
,
while
the
rain
drive
upon
the
old
diamond
window
pane
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
only
assure
you
that
whatever
confidence
you
repose
in
me
,
I
shall
never
abuse
,
Miss
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
she
say
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
in
this
matter
implicitly
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
you
for
many
reason
,
<EOS>
chief
of
them
be
that
if
a
second
victim
have
fall
beneath
the
hand
of
the
assassin
,
it
be
,
I
know
,
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
woman
!
<EOS>
whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
present
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
first
establish
the
true
fact
.
<EOS>
if
this
woman
be
really
stricken
down
,
then
her
body
lie
conceal
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
We
must
find
it
and
bring
home
the
crime
to
the
guilty
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
we
succeed
in
find
it
,
could
we
place
our
hand
upon
the
assassin
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
look
straight
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
we
find
it
,
the
crime
would
then
tell
its
own
tale
--
it
would
convict
the
person
in
whose
hand
I
have
see
that
fatal
weapon
,
"
be
her
clear
,
bold
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
wish
me
to
assist
you
in
this
search
,
Miss
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
wonder
if
her
suspicion
rest
upon
that
mysterious
yachtsman
,
Philip
Hornby
,
the
man
to
whom
she
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
would
beg
of
you
to
do
your
utmost
in
secret
to
endeavor
to
discover
the
body
of
the
second
victim
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
woman
--
of
that
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
find
her
,
and
we
shall
then
be
able
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
my
search
may
bring
suspicion
upon
me
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
difficult
to
examine
the
whole
wood
without
arouse
the
curiosity
of
somebody
--
the
keeper
or
the
police
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
think
of
that
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
pretend
to
-
morrow
to
lose
this
watch
-
bracelet
in
the
wood
,
"
and
she
hold
up
her
slim
wrist
to
show
me
the
little
enamel
watch
set
in
her
bracelet
.
<EOS>
"
then
you
and
I
will
search
for
it
diligently
,
and
the
police
will
never
suspect
the
real
reason
of
our
investigation
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
you
tell
you
about
my
loss
,
and
you
will
come
over
to
Rannoch
and
offer
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
silent
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Woodroffe
back
at
the
castle
?
<EOS>
I
hear
he
be
to
return
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
from
him
from
Bordeaux
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
on
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
indeed
,
he
have
go
to
Russia
,
where
he
sometimes
have
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
the
question
,
Miss
Muriel
,
because
I
think
if
Mr.
Woodroffe
be
here
,
he
may
object
to
our
searching
in
company
,
"
I
explain
,
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cheek
flush
slightly
,
as
though
confused
at
my
reference
to
her
engagement
,
and
she
say
mischievously
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
he
should
object
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
good
enough
to
assist
me
to
search
for
my
bracelet
,
he
surely
ought
to
be
much
oblige
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
explain
to
that
dark
-
eyed
,
handsome
girl
the
circumstance
in
which
I
have
meet
her
lover
on
the
sunny
Mediterranean
shore
,
yet
prudence
forbid
me
to
refer
to
the
matter
,
and
I
at
once
gladly
accept
her
invitation
to
investigate
the
curious
disappearance
of
the
body
of
poor
Olinto
's
fellow
-
victim
.
 
<EOS>
what
secret
knowledge
could
be
possess
by
that
smart
,
handsome
girl
before
me
?
<EOS>
that
her
suspicion
be
in
the
right
direction
I
feel
confident
,
yet
if
the
dead
woman
have
be
remove
and
hide
by
the
assassin
it
must
have
be
after
the
discovery
make
by
me
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
must
have
actually
dare
to
return
to
the
spot
and
carry
off
the
victim
.
<EOS>
yet
if
he
have
actually
do
that
,
why
do
he
allow
the
corpse
of
the
Italian
to
remain
and
await
discovery
?
<EOS>
He
may
perhaps
have
be
disturb
and
compel
to
make
good
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
the
woman
be
really
remove
the
assassin
must
surely
have
have
some
assistance
,
"
I
point
out
.
"
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
carry
the
body
very
far
unaided
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
agree
with
me
,
but
express
a
belief
that
the
double
crime
have
be
commit
alone
and
unaided
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
idea
as
to
the
motive
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
,
eager
to
hear
her
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
she
answer
hesitatingly
,
"
if
the
woman
have
fall
a
victim
,
the
motive
will
become
plain
;
but
if
not
,
then
the
matter
must
remain
a
complete
mystery
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
,
Miss
Muriel
,
that
you
suspect
the
truth
,
and
yet
you
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
murder
man
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
in
a
tone
of
slight
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
until
we
have
clear
up
the
mystery
of
the
woman
I
can
say
nothing
,
"
be
her
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
that
if
what
I
suspect
be
true
,
then
the
affair
will
be
find
to
be
one
of
the
strange
,
most
startling
and
most
ingenious
plot
ever
devise
by
one
man
against
the
life
of
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
a
man
be
the
assassin
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
but
even
of
that
I
be
not
at
all
sure
.
<EOS>
We
must
first
find
the
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
seem
so
positive
that
a
woman
have
also
fall
beneath
that
deadly
_
misericordia
_
that
I
fall
to
wonder
whether
she
,
like
myself
,
have
discover
the
body
,
and
be
therefore
certain
that
a
second
crime
have
be
commit
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
seek
to
question
her
further
,
lest
her
own
suspicion
may
become
aroused
.
<EOS>
My
own
policy
be
to
remain
silent
and
to
wait
.
<EOS>
the
woman
sit
before
me
be
herself
a
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
rain
have
abate
,
I
tell
Davis
to
send
her
trap
a
little
way
up
the
high
-
road
,
so
that
my
aunt
and
uncle
should
not
see
her
departing
;
and
after
help
her
on
with
her
loose
driving
-
coat
,
we
leave
by
one
of
the
servant
'
entrance
,
and
I
see
her
into
her
high
dog
-
cart
and
stand
bareheade
in
the
muddy
high
-
road
as
she
drive
away
into
the
gloom

Rannoch
Wood
be
already
in
its
gold
-
brown
glory
of
autumn
,
and
as
I
stand
with
Muriel
Leithcourt
on
the
edge
of
it
,
near
the
spot
where
Olinto
Santini
have
fall
,
the
morning
sun
be
shine
in
a
cloudless
sky
.
 
<EOS>
true
to
her
promise
,
she
have
send
me
a
note
by
one
of
the
groom
ask
me
to
help
search
for
her
bracelet
,
and
I
have
drive
over
at
once
to
Rannoch
and
find
her
alone
await
me
.
<EOS>
the
shoot
party
have
go
over
to
a
distant
part
of
the
estate
,
therefore
we
be
able
to
stroll
together
up
the
hill
and
commence
our
investigation
without
let
or
hindrance
.
<EOS>
She
be
sensibly
dress
in
a
short
tweed
skirt
,
high
shooting
-
boot
and
a
tam
-
o'-shanter
hat
,
while
I
also
have
on
an
old
shooting
-
suit
and
carry
a
thick
serviceable
stick
with
which
I
could
prod
likely
spot
.
 
<EOS>
on
arrival
at
the
wood
I
ask
her
opinion
which
be
the
most
likely
corner
,
but
she
reply
:
 
"
I
know
so
little
of
this
place
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
You
have
know
it
for
year
,
while
this
be
only
my
first
season
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
place
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
murderer
,
who
probably
know
the
wood
and
wish
to
conceal
a
body
in
the
vicinity
without
risk
of
convey
it
far
.
<EOS>
on
this
,
the
left
side
,
the
wood
have
be
thin
out
for
nearly
half
a
mile
,
and
therefore
afford
but
little
cover
,
while
here
,
to
the
right
,
it
slope
down
gently
to
the
valley
and
be
very
thick
and
partly
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
there
can
therefore
have
be
no
two
course
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
look
for
a
likely
place
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
let
us
start
here
,
and
first
take
a
small
circle
,
examine
every
bush
carefully
.
<EOS>
the
body
may
have
easily
be
push
in
beneath
a
thicket
and
well
escape
observation
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
together
,
after
take
our
bearing
,
we
start
off
,
work
our
way
into
the
thick
undergrowth
,
beat
with
our
stick
,
and
make
minute
examination
of
every
bush
or
heap
of
dead
leave
.
<EOS>
in
part
,
the
great
spreading
tree
shut
out
the
light
,
render
our
investigation
very
difficult
;
but
we
keep
on
,
my
companion
advance
with
an
eagerness
which
show
that
the
fact
of
the
woman
's
body
be
there
be
no
mere
surmise
.
 
<EOS>
all
through
the
morning
we
walk
on
,
our
hand
badly
tear
by
bramble
.
<EOS>
even
Muriel
's
thick
glove
do
not
wholly
protect
her
,
and
once
when
she
receive
a
nasty
scratch
across
the
cheek
,
she
stop
and
laughingly
exclaim
:
 
<EOS>
"
now
what
untruth
must
I
invent
to
account
for
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
My
own
coat
be
badly
tear
,
and
more
than
once
I
be
compel
to
scramble
through
almost
impassable
thicket
;
yet
we
find
no
trace
of
any
previous
intruder
,
and
have
complete
our
circle
be
compel
to
admit
that
the
gruesome
evidence
of
the
second
crime
do
not
exist
at
that
spot
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
<EOS>
I
feel
half
inclined
to
tell
her
how
I
have
actually
discover
the
body
of
the
woman
,
yet
on
reflection
I
foresaw
that
in
such
circumstance
silence
be
good
.
<EOS>
if
I
desire
to
solve
the
strange
complicated
enigma
which
have
thus
culminate
in
a
double
crime
,
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
keep
my
own
counsel
and
remain
patient
and
watchful
.
 
<EOS>
when
Hutcheson
reply
from
Leghorn
,
and
when
I
discover
where
Olinto
be
employ
,
I
may
perhaps
follow
up
the
clue
from
that
end
.
<EOS>
I
may
find
his
wife
Armida
and
learn
something
of
importance
from
her
.
<EOS>
so
I
be
hopeful
,
and
by
reason
of
that
hope
remain
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
be
untire
in
her
activity
.
<EOS>
hither
and
thither
<EOS>
she
go
,
beat
down
the
high
bracken
and
tangle
of
weed
,
poke
with
her
stick
into
every
hole
and
corner
,
and
go
further
and
further
into
the
wood
in
the
certainty
<EOS>
that
the
body
be
therein
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
however
,
I
be
not
too
sanguine
of
success
.
<EOS>
the
portion
of
the
wood
which
we
have
already
exhaust
seem
to
be
the
most
likely
point
.
<EOS>
to
carry
the
body
far
would
require
assistance
,
and
in
my
own
mind
I
believe
the
crime
to
have
be
the
work
of
one
person
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
path
in
the
wood
in
that
direction
,
but
soon
we
come
to
a
deep
wooded
ravine
of
the
existence
of
which
I
be
in
ignorance
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
kind
of
small
glen
through
which
a
rivulet
flow
,
but
the
bank
be
cover
with
a
thick
impenetrable
undergrowth
out
of
which
spring
many
fine
old
tree
,
a
place
that
have
apparently
exist
for
century
undisturbed
,
for
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
giant
trunk
that
have
decay
and
fall
lie
across
the
bank
,
or
have
roll
into
the
rocky
bed
far
below
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
most
likely
place
,
"
declare
my
dainty
little
companion
as
we
approach
it
.
<EOS>
"
anything
could
easily
be
conceal
in
that
high
bracken
down
there
.
<EOS>
let
us
search
the
whole
glen
from
end
to
end
,
"
she
cry
with
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
act
upon
her
suggestion
and
without
thought
of
luncheon
,
we
make
a
descent
of
the
steep
bank
until
we
reach
the
rocky
bed
of
the
stream
,
and
<EOS>
then
by
spring
from
stone
to
stone
--
sometimes
slip
into
the
water
,
be
it
say
--
we
commence
to
beat
the
bracken
and
carefully
examine
every
bush
.
<EOS>
progress
be
not
swift
.
<EOS>
once
the
girl
,
lithe
and
athletic
as
she
be
,
slip
off
a
mossy
stone
into
a
hole
where
the
water
be
up
to
her
knee
.
<EOS>
but
she
only
laugh
gayly
at
the
accident
,
and
wring
out
her
wet
skirt
,
say
:
 
"
It
do
not
matter
in
the
least
,
if
we
only
find
what
we
be
in
search
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
undaunte
,
she
go
on
,
spring
from
stone
to
stone
and
steady
herself
with
her
stick
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
only
discover
the
body
of
the
dead
woman
,
then
the
rest
would
be
clear
,
she
declare
.
<EOS>
She
would
openly
denounce
the
assassin
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
go
on
I
revolve
within
my
mind
all
the
curious
circumstance
in
connection
with
the
amazing
affair
,
and
recollect
my
old
friend
Jack
Durnford
's
word
when
we
stand
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
of
the
_
Bulwark
_
<EOS>
and
I
have
relate
to
him
the
visit
of
the
mysterious
yacht
.
<EOS>
I
too
have
leave
one
effort
untrie
,
and
I
blame
myself
for
overlook
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seek
of
that
Bond
Street
photographer
the
name
and
address
of
the
original
of
the
photograph
that
have
be
mutilate
and
destroy
--
that
girl
with
the
magnificent
eye
that
have
so
attract
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
afternoon
pass
,
and
yet
we
be
not
successful
.
<EOS>
I
be
faint
with
hunger
and
thirst
,
yet
my
companion
do
not
once
complain
.
<EOS>
Her
energy
be
marvelous
--
and
yet
be
she
not
hunt
down
a
criminal
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
determined
to
obtain
such
evidence
as
would
enable
her
to
speak
the
truth
fearlessly
,
and
with
confidence
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
convict
the
guilty
one
?
 
<EOS>
slowly
we
toil
on
up
the
picturesque
little
glen
for
nearly
a
mile
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Its
beauty
be
extraordinary
,
and
the
silence
be
unbroken
save
for
the
musical
ripple
of
the
water
over
the
stone
.
<EOS>
hide
there
in
the
center
of
that
great
wood
,
no
one
have
visit
it
perhaps
for
year
,
not
even
the
keeper
,
for
no
path
lead
there
,
and
by
reason
of
the
tangle
of
briars
and
bush
it
be
utterly
ungetatable
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
have
ruin
our
clothe
to
search
there
,
and
as
we
go
on
with
so
many
winding
and
turn
we
become
utterly
out
of
our
bearing
.
<EOS>
We
know
ourselves
to
be
in
the
center
of
the
wood
,
but
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
have
set
,
and
the
sky
above
show
the
crimson
of
the
distant
afterglow
,
warn
us
that
it
be
time
we
begin
to
think
of
how
to
make
our
exit
.
<EOS>
We
be
pass
around
a
sharp
bend
in
the
glen
where
the
boulder
be
so
thickly
moss
-
grow
that
our
foot
fall
noiselessly
,
when
I
think
I
hear
a
voice
,
and
raise
my
hand
we
both
halt
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
someone
be
there
,
"
I
whisper
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
behind
that
rock
.
<EOS>
"
She
nod
in
the
affirmative
,
for
she
,
too
,
have
hear
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
We
listen
,
but
the
sound
be
not
repeat
.
<EOS>
that
someone
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
I
know
,
for
in
a
tree
in
the
vicinity
a
thrush
be
hop
from
twig
to
twig
,
sound
its
alarm
-
cry
and
objecting
to
be
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
we
creep
silently
forward
together
to
ascertain
who
be
the
intruder
.
<EOS>
the
only
manner
,
however
,
in
which
to
get
a
view
beyond
the
huge
rock
that
,
have
fall
across
the
stream
century
ago
,
have
divert
its
channel
,
be
to
clamber
up
its
mossy
side
to
the
summit
.
<EOS>
this
we
do
eagerly
and
breathlessly
,
without
betray
our
presence
by
the
utterance
of
a
single
word
.
 
<EOS>
to
reach
the
side
of
the
boulder
we
be
compel
to
walk
through
the
shallow
water
,
but
Muriel
,
quite
undaunted
,
sprang
lithely
along
at
my
side
,
and
with
one
accord
we
swarm
up
the
steep
rock
,
grip
its
slippery
face
with
our
hand
and
lay
ourselves
flat
as
we
come
to
its
summit
.
 
<EOS>
then
together
we
peer
over
,
just
,
however
,
in
time
to
see
two
dark
figure
of
man
disappear
into
the
thicket
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
glen
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
they
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
recognize
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
They
be
entire
stranger
to
me
,
"
be
her
answer
.
"
<EOS>
but
they
seem
fairly
well
dressed
.
<EOS>
perhaps
two
sportsman
from
some
shooting
-
party
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
They
have
lose
their
way
most
probably
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
they
carry
gun
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
them
have
something
over
his
shoulder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
a
gun
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
be
not
carry
it
like
he
would
carry
a
gun
.
<EOS>
It
be
short
--
and
seem
more
like
a
spade
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
spade
!
"
<EOS>
she
gasp
quickly
in
a
low
voice
.
"
<EOS>
a
spade
!
<EOS>
be
you
certain
of
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
at
all
certain
.
<EOS>
We
only
have
an
instantaneous
glance
of
them
.
<EOS>
We
be
unfortunately
too
late
to
see
them
face
to
face
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
back
of
one
of
the
man
,
the
tall
fellow
in
the
brown
suit
,
be
broad
and
square
--
the
back
of
someone
who
be
familiar
to
me
,
only
for
the
moment
I
can
not
recollect
whose
it
resemble
.
<EOS>
"
She
only
speak
in
a
whisper
,
fear
lest
we
should
be
discover
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
scramble
down
and
rush
after
the
intruder
,
only
the
belief
that
one
of
them
carry
a
spade
and
the
other
<EOS>
an
iron
bar
strike
me
as
curious
,
while
at
the
same
moment
my
eye
catch
sight
of
a
portion
of
the
ground
below
us
at
the
base
of
the
rock
which
have
evidently
be
recently
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
spade
the
man
be
carry
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
excitedly
.
<EOS>
"
look
down
there
!
<EOS>
They
have
just
be
bury
something
!
"
 
<EOS>
Her
quick
eye
follow
the
direction
I
indicate
,
and
she
answer
:
 
"
I
really
believe
they
have
conceal
something
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
when
we
have
allow
the
man
to
get
beyond
hearing
,
we
both
slip
down
to
the
other
side
of
the
boulder
and
there
discover
many
sign
that
the
earth
have
be
hurriedly
excavate
and
only
just
replace
.
 
<EOS>
quicker
than
it
take
to
describe
the
exciting
incident
which
follow
,
we
break
down
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
with
it
commence
move
the
freshly
disturb
earth
,
which
be
still
soft
and
easily
remove
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
find
a
dead
branch
in
the
vicinity
,
and
both
of
us
set
to
work
with
a
will
,
eager
to
ascertain
what
be
hide
there
.
<EOS>
that
something
have
certainly
be
conceal
be
,
to
us
,
quite
evident
,
but
what
it
really
be
we
could
not
surmise
.
<EOS>
the
hole
they
have
dig
do
not
seem
large
enough
to
admit
a
human
body
,
yet
leave
have
be
carefully
strew
over
the
place
which
,
if
approach
from
any
other
point
than
the
high
-
up
one
whence
we
have
see
it
,
would
arouse
no
suspicion
that
the
ground
have
ever
be
interfere
with
.
 
<EOS>
dig
with
a
piece
of
wood
be
hard
and
laborious
work
and
it
be
a
long
time
before
we
remove
sufficient
earth
to
make
a
hole
of
any
size
.
<EOS>
but
Muriel
exert
all
her
energy
,
and
both
of
us
work
on
in
dogged
silence
full
of
wonder
and
anticipation
.
<EOS>
with
a
spade
we
should
have
soon
be
able
to
investigate
,
but
the
earth
have
apparently
be
stamp
down
hard
prior
to
the
last
covering
be
put
upon
it
,
our
progress
be
very
slow
and
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
after
we
have
commence
,
Muriel
,
stand
in
the
hole
and
have
dig
her
stake
deeply
into
the
ground
,
suddenly
cry
:
 
"
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
look
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
<EOS>
why
--
whatever
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
bend
forward
as
she
indicate
,
and
my
eye
meet
an
object
so
unexpected
that
I
be
hold
dumb
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
by
what
we
have
succeed
in
discovering
,
the
mystery
be
increase
rather
than
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
vent
to
an
ejaculation
of
complete
bewilderment
,
and
look
blankly
into
my
companion
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
amazing
enigma
be
surely
complete
!
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII
 
contain
a
surprise
  
<EOS>
the
first
object
bring
to
light
,
about
two
foot
beneath
the
surface
,
be
a
piece
of
dark
gray
woolen
stuff
which
,
when
the
mold
be
remove
,
prove
to
be
part
of
a
woman
's
skirt
.
 
<EOS>
with
frantic
eagerness
I
get
into
the
hole
we
have
make
and
remove
the
soil
with
my
hand
,
until
I
suddenly
touch
something
hard
.
 
<EOS>
a
body
lie
there
,
double
up
and
crush
into
the
well
-
like
hole
the
man
have
dig
.
 
<EOS>
together
we
pull
it
out
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
,
on
wipe
away
the
dirt
from
the
hard
waxen
feature
,
I
recognize
it
as
the
body
of
Armida
,
the
woman
who
have
be
my
servant
in
Leghorn
and
who
have
afterwards
marry
Olinto
.
<EOS>
both
have
be
assassinate
!
 
<EOS>
when
Muriel
gaze
upon
the
dead
woman
's
face
she
give
vent
to
an
expression
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
the
body
be
evidently
not
that
of
the
person
she
have
expect
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
she
,
I
wonder
?
"
<EOS>
my
companion
ejaculate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
a
lady
,
evidently
,
by
her
dress
and
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
evidently
not
,
"
be
my
response
,
for
I
still
deem
it
good
to
keep
my
own
counsel
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
the
story
Olinto
have
tell
me
about
his
wife
;
of
her
illness
and
her
longing
to
return
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
yet
the
dead
woman
's
countenance
must
have
be
healthy
enough
in
life
,
although
her
hand
be
rough
and
hard
,
show
that
she
have
be
do
manual
labor
.
 
<EOS>
Armida
have
be
a
particularly
good
housemaid
,
a
black
-
haired
,
black
-
eyed
Tuscan
,
quick
,
cleanly
,
and
full
of
a
keen
sense
of
humor
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
shock
to
me
to
find
her
lie
there
dead
.
<EOS>
the
breast
of
her
dress
be
stain
with
dry
blood
,
which
,
on
examination
,
I
find
have
issue
from
a
deep
and
fatal
wound
beneath
the
ear
where
she
have
be
strike
an
unerring
blow
that
have
sever
the
artery
.
 
<EOS>
"
those
man
--
those
man
who
bury
her
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
they
be
?
"
<EOS>
my
companion
exclaim
in
a
hushed
voice
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
follow
them
and
ascertain
.
<EOS>
They
be
certainly
the
murderer
who
have
return
in
secret
and
conceal
the
evidence
of
this
second
crime
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
after
them
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
escape
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
leave
the
exhumed
body
beneath
a
tree
,
I
catch
Muriel
by
the
waist
and
wade
across
the
deep
channel
wear
by
the
stream
at
that
point
,
after
which
we
both
ascend
the
steep
bank
where
the
pair
have
disappear
in
the
darkness
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
I
blame
myself
a
thousand
time
for
not
follow
them
,
yet
my
suspicion
have
not
be
arouse
until
after
they
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
the
back
of
the
man
in
a
snuff
-
colored
suit
be
,
she
feel
confident
,
familiar
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
repeat
what
she
have
already
tell
me
,
yet
she
could
not
remember
where
she
have
see
a
similar
figure
before
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
on
through
the
gloomy
forest
,
for
the
light
have
fade
and
evening
be
now
creep
on
.
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
we
halt
and
listen
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
dead
silence
,
break
only
by
the
shrill
cry
of
a
night
bird
and
the
low
rustling
of
the
leave
in
the
autumn
wind
.
<EOS>
the
man
know
their
way
,
it
seem
,
even
though
the
wood
be
trackless
.
<EOS>
yet
they
have
nearly
twenty
minute
start
of
us
,
and
in
that
time
they
may
be
already
out
in
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
Would
they
succeed
in
evade
us
?
<EOS>
yet
even
if
they
do
,
I
could
describe
the
dress
of
one
of
them
,
while
that
of
his
companion
be
,
as
far
as
I
make
out
,
dark
blue
,
of
a
somewhat
nautical
cut
.
<EOS>
He
wear
also
a
flat
cap
,
with
a
peak
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
on
,
strike
straight
for
the
open
moorland
which
we
know
bound
the
wood
in
that
direction
,
and
before
the
light
have
entirely
fade
we
find
ourselves
out
amongst
the
heather
with
the
distant
hill
loom
dark
against
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
but
we
see
no
sign
of
the
man
who
have
so
secretly
conceal
the
body
of
their
victim
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
back
to
the
castle
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
then
I
will
drive
on
into
dumfrie
and
see
the
police
.
<EOS>
these
man
must
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
do
,
"
she
urge
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
get
into
the
house
by
the
stable
-
yard
,
for
they
must
not
see
me
in
this
terrible
plight
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
rough
walking
,
therefore
at
my
invitation
she
take
my
arm
,
and
as
she
do
so
<EOS>
I
feel
that
she
be
shiver
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
wet
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
take
cold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
be
used
to
get
wet
.
<EOS>
I
drive
and
cycle
a
lot
,
you
know
,
and
very
often
get
drench
,
"
be
her
reply
.
<EOS>
then
after
a
pause
she
say
:
"
We
must
discover
who
that
woman
be
.
<EOS>
She
seem
,
from
her
complexion
and
her
hair
,
to
be
a
foreigner
,
like
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
so
,
"
be
my
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
the
police
all
that
we
have
find
out
,
and
they
will
go
there
presently
and
recover
the
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
they
can
only
find
those
two
man
,
then
we
should
know
the
truth
,
"
she
declare
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
them
--
the
one
in
brown
--
be
unusually
broad
-
shouldered
,
and
seem
to
walk
with
a
slight
stoop
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
expect
to
discover
another
woman
,
do
you
not
,
Miss
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
presently
,
as
we
walk
across
the
moor
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
expect
to
find
an
entirely
different
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
you
have
find
her
it
would
have
prove
the
guilt
of
someone
with
whom
you
be
acquaint
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
we
have
find
this
evening
do
not
convey
to
you
the
identity
of
the
assassin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
unfortunately
it
do
not
.
<EOS>
We
must
for
the
present
leave
the
matter
in
the
hand
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
the
identity
of
the
dead
woman
be
establish
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
furnish
me
with
a
clue
,
"
she
exclaim
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
try
and
discover
who
she
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
the
woman
you
expect
to
find
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
friend
--
a
very
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
tell
me
her
name
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
would
be
unfair
to
her
,
"
she
respond
decisively
,
an
answer
which
to
me
be
particularly
tantalize
.
 
<EOS>
on
we
plod
in
silence
,
our
thought
too
full
for
word
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
strange
that
the
mysterious
yachtsman
should
be
her
lover
,
and
strange
still
that
on
recognize
me
he
should
have
escape
,
not
only
from
Scotland
,
but
away
to
the
Continent
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
that
,
in
itself
,
evidence
of
guilt
and
fear
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
dark
when
I
take
leave
of
my
bright
little
companion
,
who
,
tire
out
and
yet
uncomplaine
,
<EOS>
press
my
hand
and
wish
me
good
fortune
in
my
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
await
you
to
-
morrow
afternoon
.
<EOS>
call
and
tell
me
everything
,
will
not
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
promise
,
and
then
she
disappear
into
the
great
stable
-
yard
behind
the
castle
,
while
I
go
on
down
the
dark
road
and
then
strike
across
the
open
field
to
my
uncle
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
nine
that
night
I
pull
up
the
dog
-
cart
before
the
chief
police
-
station
in
dumfrie
,
and
alight
at
once
seek
the
big
fair
Highlander
,
Mackenzie
,
with
whom
I
have
have
the
consultation
on
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
seat
in
his
room
beneath
the
hiss
gas
-
jet
,
I
relate
my
adventure
and
the
result
of
my
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
?
<EOS>
"
he
cry
,
jump
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
unearth
another
body
--
a
woman
's
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
more
,
I
can
identify
her
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Her
name
be
Armida
,
and
she
be
wife
of
the
murder
man
olinto
Santini
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
both
husband
and
wife
be
kill
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
without
a
doubt
--
a
double
tragedy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
the
two
man
who
conceal
the
body
!
<EOS>
Will
you
describe
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
he
write
at
my
dictation
,
afterwards
remarking--
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
find
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
call
in
one
of
his
sub
-
inspector
,
he
give
him
instruction
for
the
immediate
circulation
of
the
description
to
all
the
police
-
station
in
the
county
,
say
the
two
man
be
want
on
a
charge
of
willful
murder
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
official
have
go
out
again
and
we
be
alone
,
Mackenzie
turn
to
me
and
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
what
induce
you
to
search
the
wood
?
<EOS>
why
do
you
suspect
a
second
crime
?
"
 
<EOS>
His
question
nonplus
me
for
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
see
,
I
have
identify
the
young
man
olinto
,
and
know
him
to
be
marry
and
devoted
to
his
wife
<EOS>
,
I
suspect
that
she
have
accompany
him
here
.
<EOS>
It
be
entirely
a
vague
surmise
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
,
if
the
poor
fellow
have
fall
a
victim
to
his
enemy
,
she
have
not
also
be
strike
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
lip
be
press
together
in
distinct
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
explanation
to
be
a
very
lame
one
,
but
at
all
hazard
<EOS>
I
could
not
import
Muriel
's
name
into
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
have
give
her
my
promise
,
and
I
intend
to
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
the
body
be
still
in
the
glen
,
where
you
leave
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
if
you
wish
,
I
will
take
you
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
can
drive
you
and
your
assistant
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
,
"
he
exclaim
,
rise
at
once
and
ring
his
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
get
three
good
lantern
and
some
match
,
and
put
them
in
this
gentleman
's
trap
outside
,
"
he
say
to
the
constable
who
answer
his
summon
.
"
<EOS>
and
tell
Gilbert
Campbell
that
I
want
him
to
go
with
me
up
to
Rannoch
Wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
man
;
and
the
door
again
close
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
--
a
thousand
pity
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
that
you
do
not
stop
those
two
man
who
bury
the
body
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
already
across
the
stream
,
and
disappear
into
the
thicket
before
I
mount
the
rock
,
"
I
explain
.
<EOS>
"
besides
,
at
the
moment
I
have
no
suspicion
of
what
they
would
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
believe
them
to
be
straggler
from
a
neighboring
shoot
-
party
who
have
lose
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
most
unfortunate
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
do
not
escape
us
.
<EOS>
if
they
be
foreigner
,
they
be
not
likely
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
but
if
they
be
English
or
Scots
,
then
I
fear
there
be
but
little
chance
of
us
come
up
with
them
.
<EOS>
yesterday
at
the
inquest
the
identity
of
the
murder
man
be
strictly
preserve
,
and
the
inquiry
be
adjourn
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
my
name
be
not
mention
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
,
"
be
the
detective
's
reply
.
<EOS>
then
he
ask
:
"
when
do
you
expect
to
get
a
telegram
from
your
friend
,
the
Consul
at
Leghorn
?
<EOS>
I
be
anxious
for
that
,
in
order
that
we
may
commence
inquiry
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
He
will
certainly
reply
at
once
,
provide
the
dead
man
's
father
can
still
be
find
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
at
that
moment
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
who
prove
to
be
Detective
Campbell
,
enter
,
and
five
minute
later
we
be
all
three
drive
over
the
uneven
cobble
of
dumfrie
and
out
in
the
darkness
towards
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
cloudy
and
starless
,
with
a
chill
mist
hang
over
the
valley
;
but
my
uncle
's
cob
be
a
swift
one
,
and
we
soon
begin
to
ascend
the
hill
up
past
the
castle
,
and
then
,
turn
to
the
left
,
drive
along
a
steep
,
rough
by
-
road
which
lead
to
the
south
of
the
wood
and
out
across
the
moor
.
<EOS>
when
we
reach
the
latter
we
all
descend
,
and
I
lead
the
horse
,
for
owe
to
the
many
treacherous
bog
it
be
unsafe
to
drive
further
.
<EOS>
so
,
with
Mackenzie
and
Campbell
carry
lantern
,
we
walk
on
carefully
,
skirt
the
wood
for
nearly
a
mile
until
we
come
to
the
rough
wall
over
which
I
have
clamber
with
Muriel
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognize
the
spot
,
and
have
tie
up
the
cob
<EOS>
we
all
three
plunge
into
the
pitch
-
darkness
of
the
wood
,
keep
straight
on
in
the
direction
of
the
glen
,
and
halt
every
now
and
then
to
listen
for
the
rippling
of
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
some
difficulty
,
we
discover
it
,
and
search
along
the
bank
with
our
three
powerful
light
,
I
presently
detect
the
huge
moss
-
grow
boulder
whereon
I
have
stand
when
the
pair
of
fugitive
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
!
"
<EOS>
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
spot
!
"
<EOS>
and
quickly
we
clamber
down
the
steep
bank
,
lower
ourselves
by
the
branch
of
the
tree
until
we
come
to
the
water
into
which
I
wade
,
be
follow
closely
by
my
two
companion
.
 
<EOS>
on
gain
the
opposite
side
I
clamber
up
to
the
base
of
the
boulder
and
lower
my
lantern
to
reveal
to
them
the
gruesome
evidence
of
the
second
crime
,
but
the
next
instant
I
cried--
 
<EOS>
"
why
!
<EOS>
It
be
go
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
go
!
"
<EOS>
gasp
the
two
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
.
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
this
be
the
hole
where
they
bury
it
!
<EOS>
but
they
evidently
return
,
and
find
it
exhume
,
they
have
retake
possession
of
it
and
carry
it
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
two
detective
gaze
down
to
where
I
indicate
,
and
then
look
at
each
other
without
exchange
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
stand
there
dumbfound
at
the
disappearance
of
the
body
,
the
Highlander
's
quick
glance
catch
something
,
and
stoop
he
pick
it
up
and
examine
the
little
object
by
the
aid
of
his
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
within
his
palm
I
see
lie
a
tiny
little
gold
cross
,
about
an
inch
long
,
enamel
in
red
,
while
in
the
center
be
a
circular
miniature
of
a
kneel
saint
,
an
elegant
and
beautifully
execute
little
trinket
which
may
have
adorn
a
lady
's
bracelet
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
pretty
little
thing
!
"
<EOS>
remark
the
detective
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
possibly
lead
us
to
something
.
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
he
add
,
turn
to
me
,
"
be
you
quite
certain
you
leave
the
body
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
certain
?
<EOS>
"
I
echo
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
at
the
hole
I
make
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
I
have
any
interest
in
lead
you
here
on
a
fool
's
errand
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
he
say
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
the
whole
affair
seem
so
very
inconceivable
--
I
mean
that
the
man
,
have
once
get
rid
of
the
evidence
of
their
crime
,
would
hardly
return
to
the
spot
and
re
-
obtain
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
unless
they
watch
me
exhume
it
,
and
fear
the
consequence
if
it
fall
into
your
hand
,
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
they
may
have
watch
you
from
behind
the
tree
,
and
when
you
have
go
they
come
and
carry
it
away
somewhere
else
,
"
he
remark
dubiously
;
"
but
even
if
they
do
,
it
must
be
in
this
wood
.
<EOS>
They
would
never
risk
carry
a
body
very
far
,
and
here
be
surely
the
good
place
of
concealment
in
the
whole
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
only
thing
remain
be
to
search
the
wood
at
daylight
,
"
I
suggest
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
two
man
come
back
here
during
my
absence
they
may
still
be
on
the
watch
in
the
vicinity
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
probably
they
be
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
every
precaution
,
"
he
say
decisively
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
with
our
lantern
lower
,
we
make
an
examination
of
the
vicinity
,
without
,
however
,
discover
anything
else
to
furnish
us
with
a
clew
.
<EOS>
while
I
have
be
absent
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
Armida
have
disappear
--
a
fact
which
,
know
all
that
I
do
,
be
doubly
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
the
pair
have
,
without
doubt
,
watch
Muriel
and
myself
,
and
as
soon
as
we
have
go
they
have
return
and
carry
off
the
ghastly
remain
of
the
poor
woman
who
have
be
so
foully
do
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
but
who
be
the
man
--
the
fellow
with
the
broad
shoulder
whom
Muriel
recognize
,
and
the
slim
seafarer
in
his
pilot
-
coat
and
peak
cap
?
<EOS>
the
enigma
each
hour
become
more
and
more
inscrutable
.
 
<EOS>
at
dawn
Mackenzie
,
with
four
of
his
man
,
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
wood
,
but
although
they
continue
until
dusk
they
discover
nothing
,
neither
be
anything
hear
of
the
mysterious
seafarer
and
his
companion
in
brown
tweed
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
on
Muriel
as
arrange
,
and
explain
how
the
body
have
so
suddenly
disappear
,
whereupon
she
stare
at
me
pale
-
faced
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
the
assassin
must
have
watch
us
!
<EOS>
They
be
aware
,
then
,
that
we
have
knowledge
of
their
crime
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
"
then
we
be
both
in
deadly
peril
--
peril
of
our
own
life
!
<EOS>
these
people
will
hesitate
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
both
you
and
I
be
mark
down
by
them
,
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
We
must
both
be
wary
not
to
fall
into
any
trap
they
may
lay
for
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
very
word
seem
an
admission
that
she
be
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
conspirator
,
and
yet
she
would
give
me
no
clue
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
out
and
up
the
drive
together
to
the
kennel
,
where
her
father
,
a
tall
,
impose
figure
in
his
shooting
-
kit
,
be
give
order
to
the
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
Gregg
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
merrily
,
extend
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
one
of
a
party
to
Glenlea
to
-
morrow
,
will
not
you
?
<EOS>
Paton
and
Phillips
be
come
.
<EOS>
ten
sharp
here
,
and
the
lady
be
come
out
to
lunch
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
thank
,
"
I
say
,
accept
with
pleasure
,
for
by
so
do
<EOS>
I
see
that
I
may
be
afford
an
opportunity
of
be
near
Muriel
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
the
assassin
be
aware
of
our
knowledge
seem
to
have
cause
her
the
great
apprehension
lest
evil
should
befall
us
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
we
turn
away
to
go
back
to
the
house

:

<EOS>
He
glance
at
me
quickly
with
his
brow
slightly
contract

as
though
he
do
not
exactly
comprehend

in

I
see
that

cause
him
quick

<EOS>
and
then
Muriel

his
side
manage
with
her
feminine
ingenuity
to
divert
the
conversation
into

I

turn
to

I

regret

he
speak
as
though
he
have
be
at

previous
day

<EOS>
"
May
I
have
a

I
ask
,
see
that
I
would
be
compel

take
something

perhaps

and
he
fill
our
glass

toss
off
his

smack
his

after
it

for
the

I
do

"
 
<EOS>
I
look
around
,
and
it
strike
me
that
the
trade
of
the
place
mainly
consist
in
chop
and
steak
for
chance
customer
at
mid
-
day
,
and
tea
and
cake
for
those
swarm
of

who
each
afternoon
buzz
around

long
line
of
window
of
the

<EOS>
"
I
could
see
that
his
be
a
cheap
trade
,
as
reveal
by
the
print
notice
stick
upon
one
of
the
long
fly

blow
mirror
:

how
long
have

I
inquire

<EOS>
"
about
a
year
--
perhaps
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
I
trust
him
implicitly
,
and
I
leave
him
in
charge
when
I
go
away
for
holiday
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
get
along
very
well
with
the
cook

who
be
milanese

<EOS>
these
Italians
from
different
province
always
quarrel

he
add
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
live
in
Italy
you
know
that
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
laugh
in
chorus
,
and
then
glance
at
my
watch
,
say
:
"
I
will
wait
for
him
,
if
he
will
be
here
at
ten
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
like
to
see
him
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Russian
be
by
no
mean
nonplus
,
but
merely
remarked--
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
late
sometimes
,
but
not
often
.
<EOS>
He
live
on
the
other
side
of
London
--
over
at
Camberwell
.
"
<EOS>
His
confidence
that
the
waiter
would
return
strike
me
as
extremely
curious
;
nevertheless
I
possess
myself
in
patience
,
stroll
up
and
down
the
restaurant
,
and
then
stand
watch
the
traffic
in
the
Grove
outside
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
Odinzoff
seem
a
quick
,
hard
-
work
fellow
with
a
keen
eye
to
business
,
for
he
fall
to
polish
the
top
of
the
marble
table
with
a
pail
and
brush
,
at
the
same
time
direct
the
work
of
the
pallid
-
look
youth
.
<EOS>
suddenly
a
side
door
open
,
and
the
cook
put
his
head
in
to
speak
with
his
master
in
French
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
typical
Italian
,
about
forty
,
with
dark
mustache
turn
upwards
,
and
an
easy
-
going
,
careless
manner
.
<EOS>
see
me
,
however
,
and
believe
me
to
be
a
customer
,
he
turn
and
close
the
door
quickly
.
<EOS>
in
that
instant
I
notice
the
high
broadness
of
his
shoulder
,
and
his
back
strike
me
as
strangely
similar
to
that
of
the
man
in
brown
whom
we
have
see
disappear
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
the
suspicion
hold
me
breathless
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
russian
endeavoring
to
deceive
me
when
he
declare
that
Olinto
would
arrive
in
a
few
minute
?
<EOS>
It
seem
curious
,
for
the
man
now
dead
must
,
I
reflect
,
have
be
away
at
least
four
day
.
<EOS>
surely
his
absence
from
work
have
cause
the
proprietor
considerable
inconvenience
?
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
your
cook
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
the
Milanese
who
be
quarrelsome
?
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
,
when
the
side
door
have
close
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
but
Emilio
be
a
very
good
workman
--
and
very
honest
,
even
though
I
have
constantly
to
complain
that
he
use
too
much
oil
in
his
cooking
.
<EOS>
these
English
do
not
like
the
oil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
stand
in
the
doorway
again
watch
the
busy
throng
pass
outside
towards
Royal
Oak
.
<EOS>
ten
o'clock
strike
from
a
neighbor
church
,
and
I
still
wait
,
know
only
too
well
that
I
wait
in
vain
for
a
man
whose
body
have
already
be
commit
to
the
grave
outside
that
far
-
away
old
Scotch
town
.
<EOS>
but
I
wait
in
order
to
ascertain
the
motive
of
the
bearded
Russian
in
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
young
fellow
would
really
return
.
 
<EOS>
presently
Odinzoff
go
outside
,
carry
with
him
two
board
upon
which
the
menu
of
the
"
eight

day

"
be
write
in
scrawly
character
,
and
proceed
to
affix
them
to
the
shop
-
front
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
opportunity
,
and
quick
as
think
I
move
towards
where
the
unhealthy
youth
be
at
work
,
and
whisper
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
half
-
a
-
sovereign
if
you
will
answer
my
question
truthfully
.
<EOS>
now
,
tell
me
,

the

,
the
man
I
have
just
see
,
here
yesterday

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

"
 
<EOS>
"
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
and
your
master
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
be
away
too
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
to
put
any
further
question
,
for
the
russian
re
-
enter
at
that
moment
,
and
the
youth
busy
himself
rub
the
front
of
the
counter
in
pretense
that
I
have
not
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
some
difficulty
in
slip
the
promise
coin
into
his
hand
at
a
moment
when
his
master
be
not
look
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
pace
up
and
down
the
restaurant
,
wait
patiently
and
wonder
whether
the
absence
of
Emilio
have
any
connection
with
the
tragedy
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
stand
there
a
rather
thin
,
respectably
-
dress
man
enter
,
and
seat
himself
upon
one
of
the
plush
lounge
at
the
further
end
,
remove
his
bowler
hat
and
order
from
the
proprietor
a
chop
and
a
pot
of
tea
.
<EOS>
then
,
take
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
,
he
settle
himself
to
read
,
apparently
oblivious
to
his
surrounding
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
as
I
watch
I
see
that
over
the
top
of
his
paper
he
be
carefully
take
in
the
general
appearance
of
the
place
,
and
his
eye
be
keenly
follow
the
Russian
's
movement
.
<EOS>
the
latter
shout
--
in
French
--
<EOS>
the
order
for
the
chop
through
the
speaking
-
tube
to
the
man
Emilio
,
and
then
return
to
his
customer
<EOS>
he
spread
out
a
napkin
and
place
a
small
cruet
,
with
knife
,
fork
,
and
bread
before
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
customer
seem
immerse
in
his
paper
,
and
never
look
up
until
after
the
Russian
's
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
then
so
deep
be
his
interest
in
the
place
,
and
so
keen
those
dark
eye
of
his
,
that
the
truth
suddenly
dawn
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Mackenzie
have
telegraph
to
Scotland
Yard
,
and
the
customer
sit
there
be
a
detective
who
have
come
to
investigate

<EOS>
I
have
advance
to
the
counter
to
chat
again
with
the
proprietor
,
when
a
quick
step
behind
me
cause
me
to
turn

<EOS>
before

compulsion
--
<EOS>
my
action
that
night
be
not
my
own
--
but
those
of
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
understand
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
come
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
speak
before
these
people
.
<EOS>
Your
padrone
know
italian
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
only
a
very
little
,
"
he
answer
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
no
fear
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
Emilio
,
the
cook
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
meet
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
quickly
,
with
a
strange
look
of
apprehension
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
an
undesirable
person
,
signore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
gather
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
desire
to
speak
to
you
outside
--
not
here
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
turn
with
a
smile
to
the
Pole
,
I
apologize
for
take
away
his
servant
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
recollect
,
I
be
his
old
master
,
I
add
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
m'sieur
,
"
answer
the
Pole
,
bow
politely
.
<EOS>
"
speak
with
him
where
and
how
long
you
will
.
<EOS>
He
be
entirely
at
your
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
be
outside
in
Westbourne
Grove
,
Olinto
walk
by
my
side
in
wonderment
,
I
ask
suddenly
:
 
"
tell
me
.
<EOS>
have
you
ever
be
in
Scotland
--
at
dumfrie
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
,
signore
,
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
answer
me
another
question
,
"
I
say
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
marry
Armida
at
the
italian
Consulate
.
<EOS>
where
be
she
now
--
where
be
she
this
morning
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
turn
pale
,
and
I
see
a
complete
change
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
signore
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
respond
,
"
I
only
wish
I
could
tell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
untrue
that
she
be
an
invalid
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
or
that
you
live
in
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
Your
address
be
in
Albany
Road
,
Camberwell
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
deny
these
fact
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
deny
them
,
Signor
Commendatore
.
<EOS>
but
how
do
you
learn
this
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
authority
in
Italy
know
everything
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
like
that
of
all
your
countryman
,
your
record
be
write
down
at
the
Commune
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
clean
one
,
at
any
rate
,
signore
,
"
he
declare
with
some
slight
warmth
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
permesso
to
carry
a
revolver
,
which
be
in
itself
sufficient
proof
that
I
be
a
man
of
spotless
character
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
cast
no
reflection
whatever
upon
you
,
Olinto
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
merely
inquire
after
your
wife
,
and
you
do
not
give
me
a
direct
reply
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
have
walk
to
the
Royal
Oak
,
and
stand
talk
on
the
curb
outside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
no
reply
,
because
I
can
not
,
"
he
say
in
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
Armida
--
my
poor
Armida
--
have
leave
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
tell
me
such
a
tale
of
distress
regard
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
I
have
already
explain
,
signore
,
I
be
not
then
master
of
my
own
action
.
<EOS>
I
be
rule
by
other
.
<EOS>
but
I
save
your
life
at
risk
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
some
day
,
when
it
be
safe
,
I
will
reveal
to
you
everything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
allow
the
past
to
remain
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
your
wife
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
hesitate
a
moment
,
look
straight
into
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
disappear
!
"
<EOS>
I
echo
.
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
not
make
any
report
to
the
police
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
reason
know
only
to
myself
I
do
not
wish
the
police
to
pry
into
my
private
affair
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
because
you
be
once
convict
at
Lucca
of
use
a
knife
--
eh
?
<EOS>
I
recollect
quite
well
that
affair
--
a
love
affair
,
<EOS>
be
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Signor
Commendatore
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
youth
then
--
a
mere
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
tell
me
the
circumstance
in
which
Armida
have
disappear
,
"
I
urge
,
for
I
see
quite
plainly
that
his
sudden
meeting
with
me
have
upset
him
,
and
that
he
be
try
to
hold
back
from
me
some
story
which
he
be
burst
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
signore
,
"
he
say
at
last
in
a
low
tone
of
confidence
,
"
I
do
not
like
to
trouble
you
with
my
private
affair
after
those
untruth
I
tell
you
when
we
last
meet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
go
on
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
the
exciting
incident
of
our
last
meeting
,
I
be
half
inclined
to
doubt
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
that
my
wife
have
mysteriously
disappear
.
<EOS>
last
Saturday
,
at
eleven
o'clock
,
she
be
talk
over
the
garden
wall
with
a
neighbor
and
be
then
dress
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
She
apparently
go
out
,
but
from
that
moment
no
one
have
see
or
hear
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
tell
him
the
ghastly
truth
,
yet
so
strange
be
the
circumstance
that
his
own
double
,
even
to
the
mole
upon
his
face
,
should
be
lie
dead
and
bury
in
Scotland
that
I
hesitate
to
relate
what
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
speak
English
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
could
make
herself
understand
very
well
,
"
he
say
with
a
sigh
,
and
I
see
a
heavy
,
thoughtful
look
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
really
devoted
to
her
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
with
the
Italian
of
whatever
station
in
life
,
love
be
all
-
consume
--
it
be
either
perfect
love
or
genuine
hatred
.
<EOS>
the
tuscan
character
be
one
of
two
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
I
glance
across
the
road
,
and
see
that
the
detective
who
have
order
his
chop
and
coffee
have
stop
to
light
his
pipe
and
be
watch
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
idea
where
your
wife
be
,
or
what
have
induce
her
to
go
away
from
home
?
<EOS>
perhaps
you
have
some
word
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
word
,
signore
!
"
<EOS>
he
echo
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
we
be
the
happy
pair
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
no
unkind
word
ever
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
there
seem
absolutely
no
reason
whatever
why
she
should
go
away
without
wish
me
a
word
of
farewell
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
have
not
you
tell
the
police
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
reason
that
I
have
already
state
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
make
inquiry
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
in
what
have
your
inquiry
result
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
--
absolutely
nothing
,
"
he
say
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
suspect
any
plot
?
<EOS>
I
recollect
that
night
in
Lambeth
you
tell
me
that
you
have
enemy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
so
I
have
,
signore
--
<EOS>
and
so
have
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
poor
Armida
may
have
be
entrap
by
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
entrap
,
what
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
they
would
kill
her
with
as
little
compunction
as
they
would
a
fly
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
ah
!
you
do
not
know
the
callousness
of
those
people
.
<EOS>
I
only
hope
and
pray
that
she
may
have
escape
and
be
in
hide
somewhere
,
and
will
arrive
unexpectedly
and
give
me
a
startling
surprise
.
<EOS>
She
delight
in
startle
me
,
"
he
add
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
poor
fellow
,
I
think
,
she
would
never
again
be
able
to
startle
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
actually
fall
a
victim
just
as
he
dread
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
think
she
must
have
be
call
away
from
home
by
some
urgent
message
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
the
manner
in
which
she
leave
thing
,
it
seem
as
though
she
go
away
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
there
be
five
sovereign
in
a
drawer
that
we
have
save
for
the
rent
,
and
she
take
them
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
pause
again
,
hesitate
whether
to
tell
him
the
terrible
truth
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
that
the
body
have
disappear
,
therefore
what
proof
have
I
of
my
allegation
that
she
have
be
murder
?
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
Olinto
,
"
I
say
as
we
move
forward
again
in
the
direction
of
Paddington
Station
,
"
have
you
any
knowledge
of
a
man
name
Leithcourt
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
start
suddenly
and
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
of
him
,
"
he
answer
very
lamely
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
of
his
daughter
--
Muriel
?
"
 
"
and
also
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
acquaint
with
them
--
nor
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
do
I
wish
to
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
they
be
enemy
of
mine
--
bitter
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
declaration
be
strange
,
for
it
throw
some
light
upon
the
tragedy
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
of
your
wife
also
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
,
"
he
respond
.
<EOS>
"
My
enemy
be
my
wife
be
also
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
tell
me
the
secret
of
that
dastardly
attempt
upon
me
when
we
last
meet
,
"
I
say
in
a
low
voice
.
"
<EOS>
why
not
tell
me
the
truth
?
<EOS>
I
surely
ought
to
know
who
my
enemy
really
be
,
so
as
to
be
warn
against
any
future
plot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
some
day
,
signore
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
tell
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
before
,
"
I
exclaim
with
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
faithful
to
me
,
you
ought
at
least
to
tell
me
the
reason
they
wish
to
kill
me
in
secret
.
"
 
"
because
they
fear
you
,
"
be
his
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
they
fear
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
make
a
gesture
with
his
hand
indicative
of
utter
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
one
question
.
<EOS>
answer
yes
<EOS>
or
no
.
<EOS>
be
the
man
<EOS>
Leithcourt
my
enemy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
young
italian
pause
,
and
then
answer
:
 
"
He
be
not
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
well
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
and
his
daughter
?
<EOS>
She
be
engage
,
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
first
meet
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
know
him
several
year
.
<EOS>
when
we
first
meet
he
be
poor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
suddenly
become
rich
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
buy
a
fine
house
in
the
country
;
live
mostly
at
the
Carlton
when
he
and
his
wife
and
daughter
be
in
London
--
although
I
believe
they
now
have
a
house
somewhere
in
the
West
End
--
and
he
often
make
long
cruise
on
his
steam
-
yacht
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
he
make
his
money
?
"
 
<EOS>
again
Olinto
elevate
his
shoulder
,
without
reply
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
would
only
betray
to
me
the
reason
he
have
be
induce
to
entice
me
to
that
house
,
I
may
then
be
able
to
form
some
conclusion
regard
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
and
their
friend
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
the
man
who
,
have
represent
the
man
now
before
me
,
have
be
strike
dead
by
an
unerring
hand
?
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
Armida
have
be
call
by
telegram
to
meet
her
husband
,
and
recognize
the
fraud
perpetrate
upon
her
threaten
to
disclose
it
and
,
for
that
reason
,
share
the
same
fate
as
the
masquerader
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
theory
that
occur
to
me
;
one
which
I
believe
to
be
the
correct
one
.
<EOS>
the
motive
be
a
mystery
,
yet
the
fact
seem
to
me
plain
enough
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
young
Italian
have
refuse
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
,
I
resolve
within
myself
to
wait
until
the
unfortunate
woman
's
body
be
recover
before
reveal
to
him
the
ghastly
truth
.
<EOS>
without
doubt
he
have
some
reason
in
withholding
from
me
the
true
fact
,
either
because
he
fear
that
I
may
become
unduly
alarmed
,
or
else
he
himself
have
be
deeply
implicate
in
the
plot
.
<EOS>
of
the
two
suggestion
,
I
be
incline
to
believe
in
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
with
me
as
far
as
the
end
of
Bishop
's
Road
,
endeavor
with
all
the
Italian
's
exquisite
diplomacy
to
obtain
from
me
what
I
know
concern
the
Leithcourts
.
<EOS>
but
I
tell
him
nothing
,
nor
do
I
reveal
that
I
have
only
that
morning
return
from
Scotland
.
<EOS>
then
at
last
we
part
,
and
he
retrace
his
step
to
the
little
restaurant
in
Westbourne
Grove
,
while
I
enter
a
hansom
and
drive
to
the
well
-
know
photographer
's
in
New
Bond
Street
,
whose
name
have
be
upon
the
torn
photograph
of
the
young
girl
in
the
white
pique
blouse
and
her
hair
fasten
with
a
bow
of
black
ribbon
,
the
picture
that
I
have
find
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
on
that
memorable
night
in
the
Mediterranean
,
and
a
duplicate
of
which
I
have
see
in
Muriel
's
cosy
little
room
up
at
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
that
she
have
tell
me
the
name
of
the
original
be
Elma
Heath
,
and
that
she
have
be
a
schoolfellow
of
her
at
Chichester
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
inquire
of
the
photographer
's
lady
-
clerk
whether
she
could
supply
me
with
a
print
of
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
considerable
time
she
search
in
her
book
for
the
name
,
and
at
last
discover
it
.
<EOS>
then
she
say
:
 
"
I
regret
,
sir
,
that
we
can
not
give
you
a
print
,
for
the
customer
purchase
the
negative
at
the
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
that
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
to
what
address
do
you
send
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
customer
who
order
it
be
apparently
a
foreigner
,
"
she
say
,
at
the
same
time
turn
round
the
ledger
so
that
I
could
read
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
that
the
entry
be
:
"

Elma--3
<EOS>

and

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
"
do
this
gentleman
come
with
the
young
lady
when
her
portrait
be
take
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
sir
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
be
here
a
year
,
and
you
see
the
date
--
over
two
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
photographer
would
know
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
new
man
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
only
come
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
business
change
hand
a
year
ago
,
and
none
of
the
previous
employee
have
remain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
unfortunate
,
"
I
say
,
greatly
disappointed
;
and
have
copy
the
address
to
which
the
negative
and
print
have
be
send
,
I
thank
her
and
leave
.
 
<EOS>
who
,
I
wonder
,
be
this
Baron
Oberg
,
and
what
relation
be
he
to
Elma
Heath
?
 
<EOS>
the
picture
of
the
girl
in
the
white
blouse
somehow
exercise
a
strange
attraction
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
never
experience
the
fascination
of
a
photograph
,
inexplicable
and
yet
forcible
--
a
kind
of
magnetism
from
which
you
can
not
release
yourself
?
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
the
curious
fact
that
some
person
have
take
it
from
its
frame
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
and
destroy
it
that
first
arouse
my
interest
;
or
it
may
have
be
the
discovery
of
it
in
Muriel
's
room
at
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
it
have
for
me
an
absorb
interest
,
for
I
often
wonder
whether
the
unknown
girl
who
have
secretly
go
ashore
from
the
yacht
when
I
have
leave
it
be
not
Elma
Heath
herself
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
this
Baron
Oberg
?
<EOS>
the
name
be
german
undoubtedly
,
yet
he
live
in
the
russian
capital
.
<EOS>
from
London
to
Petersburg
be
a
far
cry
,
yet
I
resolve
that
if
it
be
necessary
I
would
travel
there
and
investigate
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
German
Embassy
,
in
Carlton
House
Terrace
,
I
find
my
friend
Captain
Nieberding
,
the
second
secretary
,
of
whom
I
inquire
whether
the
name
of
Baron
Oberg
be
know
,
but
have
refer
to
a
number
of
german
book
in
his
Excellency
's
library
,
he
return
and
tell
me
that
the
name
do
not
appear
in
the
list
of
the
german
nobility
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
russian
--
Polish
most
probably
,
"
add
the
captain
,
a
tall
,
fair
fellow
in
gold
spectacle
,
whom
I
have
know
when
he
be
third
secretary
of
Embassy
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
be
that
it
be
not
a
german
name
,
for
there
be
a
little
place
call
Oberg
,
he
say
,
on
the
railway
between
Lodz
and
Lowicz
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
luncheon
,
I
go
to
Albany
Road
,
one
of
those
dreary
,
old
-
fashioned
street
that
be
pleasant
back
in
the
early
victorian
day
when
Camberwell
be
a
suburb
and
Walworth
Common
be
still
an
open
waste
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
house
where
Olinto
live
--
a
small
,
smoke
-
blacken
,
semi
-
detached
place
stand
back
in
a
tiny
strip
of
weedy
garden
,
with
a
wooden
veranda
before
the
first
floor
window
.
<EOS>
the
house
,
accord
to
the
woman
who
keep
a
general
shop
at
the
corner
,
be
occupy
by
two
family
.
<EOS>
the
"
Eye
-
talian
,
"
as
she
term
them
,
live
above
,
while
the
Gibbonses
rent
the
ground
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
the
foreigner
be
respectable
enough
.
<EOS>
always
pay
me
ready
money
for
everythink
,
except
the
milk
.
<EOS>
that
they
pay
for
weekly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
the
wife
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
what
have
you
hear
about
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
do
say
,
sir
,
that
they
'
ad
<EOS>
some
word
together
the
other
day
,
and
that
the
woman
's
take
herself
off
in
a
tantrum
.
<EOS>
only
you
can
not
believe
all
you
'
ear
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
they
often
quarrel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
to
my
knowledge
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
be
really
very
quiet
,
respectable
person
for
foreigner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
repasse
the
house
of
the
dead
woman
,
and
then
regain
the
busy
Camberwell
Road
<EOS>
I
take
an
omnibus
back
to
the
Hotel
Cecil
in
the
Strand
where
I
have
put
up
,
tired
and
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
run
down
to
Chichester
,
and
after
some
difficulty
find
the
Cheverton
College
for
Ladies
,
a
big
old
-
fashioned
house
about
half
-
a
-
mile
out
of
the
town
on
the
Drayton
Road
.
<EOS>
the
seminary
be
evidently
a
first
-
class
one
,
for
when
I
enter
I
notice
how
well
everything
be
keep
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
principal
,
an
elderly
lady
of
a
somewhat
severe
aspect
,
I
say
:
 
"
I
regret
,
<EOS>
madam
,
to
trouble
you
,
but
I
be
in
search
of
information
you
can
supply

<EOS>
It
be
with
regard
to
a
certain
Elma
Heath
whom
you
have
as
pupil
here
,
and
who
leave
,
I
believe
,
about
two
year
ago

<EOS>
Her
parent
live
in
Durham

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
her
perfectly
,
"
be
the
woman
's
response
as
she
sit
behind
the
big
desk
,
have
apparently
at
first
expect
that
I
have
a
daughter
to
put
to
school
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
,
"
there
have
be
some
little
friction
in
the
family
,
and
I
be
make
inquiry
on
behalf
of
another
branch
of
it
--
an
aunt
who
desire
to
ascertain
the
girl
's
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah

I
regret

,
that
I

<EOS>
the
Baron

her
uncle
,

here
one
day
and
take
her
away
suddenly
--
abroad
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
she
<EOS>
no
school
-
friend
to
whom
she
would
probably
write
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
girl
name
Leithcourt
--
Muriel
Leithcourt
--
who
be
her
friend
,
but
who
have
also
leave

"
<EOS>
and
no

else

<EOS>
"
I
ask

"
<EOS>
girl
often
write
to
each
other
after
leave
school
,
until
they
get
married
,
and
then
the
correspondence
usually
cease

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
principal
be
silent
and
reflective
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
"
there
be
another
pupil
who
be
also
on
friendly
term
with
Elma
--
a
girl
name
Lydia
Moreton

<EOS>
She
may
have
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
you
really
desire
to
know
,
sir
,
I
dare
say
I
could
find
her
address
.
<EOS>
She
leave
us
about
nine
month
after
Elma
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
esteem
it
<EOS>
a
great
favor
if
you
would
give
me
that
young
lady
's
address
<EOS>
,
"
I
say
,
whereupon
she
unlock
a
drawer
in
her
writing
-
table
and
take
therefrom
a
thick
,
leather
-
bind
book
which
she
consult
for
a
few
minute
,
at
last
exclaiming
:
 
"
yes
,
here
it
is--'Lydia

"
<EOS>
and
she
scribble
it
in
pencil
upon
an
envelope
,
and
hand
it
to
me
,
say
:
 
"
Elma
Heath

I
fear

somewhat
neglect
by

<EOS>
She
remain
here
for
five
year
,
and
have
no
holiday
like
the
other
girl

<EOS>
Her
uncle
,
the
Baron
,
come
to
see
her
several
time
,
but
on
each
occasion
after
he
have
leave
I
find
her
crying
in
secret
.
<EOS>
He
be
mean
and
unkind
to
her
.
<EOS>
now
that
I
recollect
,
I
remember
that
Lydia
have
say
she
have
receive
a
letter
from
her
,
therefore
she
may
be
able
to
give
you
some
information

"
 
<EOS>
and
with
that
I
take
my
leave
,
thank
her
,
and
return
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Could
Lydia
<EOS>
Moreton
furnish
any
information
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
I
may
find
this
girl
whose
photograph
have
arouse
the
irate
jealousy
of
the
mysterious
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
the
ten
o'clock
Edinburgh
express
from
King
's
Cross
next
morning
take
me
up
to
Doncaster
,
and
hire
a
musty
old
fly
at
the
station
<EOS>
,
I
drive
three
mile
out
of
the
town
on
the
Rotherham
Road
,
find
Whiston
Grange
to
be
a
fine
old
Elizabethan
mansion
in
the
center
of
a
great
park
,
with
tall
old
twist
chimney
,
and
beautifully
-
keep
garden
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
descend
at
the
door
and
rang
,
the
footman
be
not
aware
whether
Miss
Lydia
be
in
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
somewhat
suspiciously
,
I
think
,
until
I
give
my
card
and
impressed
upon
him
meaningly
that
I
have
come
from
London
purposely
to
see
his
young
mistress
upon
a
very
important
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
her
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
I
wish
to
see
her

her

<EOS>
"
Miss
Elma

Eath

"
repeat
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Will
you
walk
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
follow
him
across
the
big
old
oak
-
panel
hall
,
fill
with
trophy
of
the
chase
and
arm
of
the
civil
war
,
into
a
small
paneled
room
on
the
left
,
the
deep
-
set
window
with
its
diamond
pane
give
out
upon
the
old
bowling

green
and
the
flower

garden
beyond

<EOS>
presently
the
door
open
,
and
a
tall
dark
-
haired
girl
in
white
enter
with
an
enquire
expression
upon
her
face
as
she
halt
and
bow
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lydia
Moreton
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
I
commence
,
and
as
she
reply
in
the
affirmative
I
go
on
:
"
<EOS>
I
have
first
to
apologize
for

me
to

who
,
I
believe
,
be
one
of
your
most
intimate
friend
at
school

"
<EOS>
and
I
add
a
lie
,
say
:
"
I
be
try

on

an
aunt
of

to

"
 
<EOS>
"

respond
the
girl
,
"

She
dread

<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
she
would
never
say

<EOS>
She
have
some
deep

root
terror
of
her
uncle
,
Baron
Oberg
,
who
live
in
St.
Petersburg
,
and
who
come
over
at
long
interval
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
but
possibly
you
know
the
whole
story
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
,
"
I
cry
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
further
her
interest

well

me
a
great
personal
favor

tell
me

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
little
,

she
answer
,
lean
back
against
the
edge
of
the
table
and
regard
me
seriously
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Elma
!
<EOS>
Her
people
treat
her
very
badly
indeed
.
<EOS>
They
send
her
no
money
,
and
allow
her
no
holiday
,
and
yet
she
be
the
sweetest
-
temper
and
most
patient
girl
in
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
--
and
the
story
regard
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
suppose
that
her
people
at
Durham
do
not
exist
,
"
she
explain
.
<EOS>
"
Elma
have
evidently
live
a
great
part
of
her
life
abroad
,
for
she
could
speak
french
and
italian
better
than
the
professor
himself
,
and
therefore
always
win
the
prize
.
<EOS>
the
class
revolt
,
and
then
she
do
not
compete
any
more
.
<EOS>
yet
she
never
tell
us
of
where
she
have
live
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
She
come
from
Durham
,
she
say
--
that
be
all

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
letter
from
her
after
the
Baron
come
and
take
her
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
from
London
.
<EOS>
She
say
that
she
have
be
to
several
play
and
concert
,
but
do
not
care
for
life
in
town

<EOS>
there
be
too
much
bustle

noise

study

and
what
other

do
you

three

I

<EOS>
They
be
all
from

abroad

<EOS>
one
be
from
Vienna

one
be
from
Milan

the

"
yes

the

I

interrupt

<EOS>
"
well

only
a
fortnight

<EOS>
if
you
will
wait
a

I

get
it

<EOS>
It

so
strange
that
I

not

it

"
<EOS>
and
she
go
out
,
and
I
hear

"
My

"
perhaps
you

never

this
letter
--
the
last

shall
ever

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
run
great
risk
in

<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
you

not
know
the
awful

all
the
terror

torture
I

<EOS>
but
no

can
assist
me
,
and
I
be
now
look
forward
to
the
time
when
it
will
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
do
you
recollect
our
old
peaceful
day
in
the
garden
at
Chichester
?
<EOS>
I
think
of
them
always
,
always
,
and
compare
that
sweet
peace
of
the
past
with
my
own
terrible
suffering
of
to

day

<EOS>
ah

how
I

how
that
I
may
feel
your
hand
upon
my

,
and
hear
your
word
of
hope
and
encouragement
!
<EOS>
but
happiness
be
now
debar
from
me
,
and
I
be
only
sink
to
the
grave
under
this
slow
torture
of
body

of
soul

<EOS>
It

CHAPTER
IX
 
<EOS>
strange
disclosures
<EOS>
are
make
  
<EOS>
the
strange
letter
of
Elma
Heath
,
combine
with
what
Lydia
Moreton
have
tell
me
,
arouse
within
me
a
determination
to
investigate
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
I
have
land
from
the
_
Lola
_
on
that
hot
,
breathless
night
at
Leghorn
,
mystery
have
crowd
upon
mystery
until
it
be
all
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
prove
that
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
,
the
original
of
the
tear
photograph
,
hold
a
secret
,
and
that
,
by
her
own
word
,
she
know
that
death
be
approach
.
<EOS>
the
incomprehensible
attempt
upon
my
life
,
the
strange
action
of
Hornby
and
Chater
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
seem
to
have
entirely
disappear
--
the
assassination
of
the
man
who
by
masquerade
as
the
italian
waiter
have
meet
his
death
,
and
the
murder
of
Olinto
's
wife
be
all
problem
which
require
solution
.
 
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
mystery
of
it
all
--
and
mystery
ever
arouse
the
human
curiosity
--
I
should
have
give
up
try
to
get
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
yet
as
a
man
with
some
leisure
,
and
know
by
that
letter
of
Elma
Heath
's
that
she
be
in
sore
distress
,
I
redouble
my
effort
to
ascertain
the
reason
of
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
mystery
of
the
_
Lola
_
be
still
a
mystery
along
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
at
every
french
and
italian
port
the
yacht
's
false
name
and
general
build
be
write
in
the
police
-
book
,
while
at
Lloyd
's
the
name
_
Lola
_
be
mark
down
as
among
the
mysterious
craft
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Chater
be
miss
,
while
Hornby
be
abroad
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
be
both
cruise
again
,
with
their
yacht
repaint
and
bear
a
fresh
name
.
<EOS>
but
why
?
<EOS>
what
have
be
their
motive
?
 
<EOS>
stir
by
the
complete
mystery
which
now
seem
to
enshroud
the
unfortunate
girl
,
I
set
before
myself
the
task
of
elucidate
it
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
I
have
remain
passive
rather
than
active
,
but
I
now
realize
by
that
curious
letter
that
at
least
one
woman
's
life
be
at
stake
--
that
Elma
Heath
be
in
possession
of
some
secret
.
 
<EOS>
on
leave
Leghorn
I
have
give
up
all
hope
of
trace
the
mysterious
yachtsman
,
and
have
leave
the
matter
in
the
hand
of
the
italian
police
.
<EOS>
but
,
without
any
effort
on
my
own
part
,
I
seem
to
have
be
draw
into
a
veritable
network
of
strange
incident
,
all
of
which
combine
to
form
the
most
complete
and
remarkable
enigma
ever
present
in
life
.
<EOS>
surely
no
man
be
ever
confront
by
so
many
mystery
at
one
time
as
I
be
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
I
have
be
careful
not
to
show
my
hand
to
anyone
,
and
this
perhaps
give
me
a
distinct
advantage
.
<EOS>
on
my
journey
back
to
London
,
as
the
train
swing
through
Peterborough
and
out
across
the
rich
level
land
towards
Hitchin
,
I
recollect
Jack
Durnford
's
word
when
I
have
mention
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
<EOS>
do
he
know
?
 
<EOS>
next
month
,
in
November
,
he
be
due
back
in
London
after
his
three
year
'
service
on
the
Mediterranean
station
.
<EOS>
then
we
should
meet
in
a
few
week
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Would
he
tell
me
anything
when
he
become
aware
of
all
I
know
?
<EOS>
He
hold
some
secret
knowledge
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
his
secret
be
the
same
as
that
hold
by
the
unfortunate
girl
in
far
-
off
,
dreary
Finland
?
 
<EOS>
I
call
at
the
house
in
Cork
Street
indicate
by
Elma
,
and
learn
from
the
old
commissionaire
who
act
as
lift
-
man
and
porter
,
that
Mr.
Woodroffe
's
chamber
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
E
be
nearly
always
away
,
sir
--
abroad
,
I
think
,
"
be
all
I
could
get
out
of
the
old
soldier
,
who
,
like
his
class
,
be
no
doubt
well
pay
to
keep
his
mouth
close
.
 
<EOS>
for
two
day
I
lounge
about
Westbourne
Grove
watch
Ferrari
's
restaurant
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
busy
,
bustling
thoroughfare
,
with
so
many
shop
window
as
excuse
for
loitering
,
the
task
be
easy
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
Olinto
come
regularly
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
work
hard
all
day
,
and
leave
at
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
take
an
omnibus
home
from
Royal
Oak
.
<EOS>
His
exterior
be
calm
and
unconcerned
,
unlike
that
of
a
man
whose
devote
wife
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
approach
him
and
explain
the
ghastly
truth
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
fact
that
the
poor
woman
's
body
be
miss
.
 
<EOS>
those
September
day
be
full
of
anxiety
for
me
.
<EOS>
alone
and
unaided
I
be
try
to
solve
one
of
the
great
of
problem
,
plunge
as
I
be
in
a
veritable
sea
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
and
to
question
her
further
regard
Elma
Heath
.
<EOS>
therefore
again
I
leave
Euston
,
and
,
travel
through
the
night
,
take
my
seat
at
the
breakfast
-
table
at
Greenlaw
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
George
,
who
be
sit
alone
--
<EOS>
it
not
be
my
aunt
's
habit
to
appear
early
--
welcome
me
,
and
then
in
his
bluff
manner
sniff
and
exclaim
:
 
"
nice
going
on
up
at
Rannoch
!
<EOS>
have
you
hear
of
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
breathlessly
,
stare
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
suspicion
that
those
leithcourt
be
utter
outsider
turn
out
to
be
about
correct
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
a
very
funny
story
,
and
there
be
a
dozen
different
distort
version
of
it
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
from
what
I
can
gather
the
true
fact
be
these
:
about
seven
o'clock
the
night
before
last
,
as
Leithcourt
and
his
house
-
party
be
dress
for
dinner
,
a
telegram
arrive
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
open
it
,
and
at
once
go
off
into
hysteric
,
while
her
husband
,
in
a
breathless
hurry
,
slip
off
his
evening
clothe
again
and
get
into
an
old
blue
serge
suit
,
toss
a
few
thing
into
a
bag
,
and
then
go
along
to
Muriel
's
room
to
urge
her
to
prepare
for
secret
flight
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
flight
!
"
I
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
have
they
go
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
listen
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
the
servant
have
describe
the
whole
affair
down
in
the
village
,
so
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
show
Muriel
the
telegram
and
urge
her
to
fly
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
refuse
,
but
for
her
father
's
sake
be
induce
to
prepare
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
guest
be
in
ignorance
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
the
brougham
be
order
to
be
ready
in
the
stable
-
yard
and
not
to
go
round
,
while
Mrs.
Leithcourt
's
maid
try
to
bring
the
lady
back
to
her
sense
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
himself
,
it
seem
,
rush
hither
and
thither
,
seize
the
jewel
-
case
of
his
wife
and
daughter
and
whatever
valuable
<EOS>
he
could
place
his
hand
upon
,
while
the
mother
and
daughter
be
put
on
their
thing
.
<EOS>
as
he
rush
down
the
main
staircase
to
the
library
,
where
his
check
-
book
and
some
ready
cash
be
lock
in
the
safe
,
he
meet
a
stranger
who
have
just
be
admit
and
show
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
close
the
door
and
face
him
.
<EOS>
what
afterwards
transpire
,
however
,
be
a
mystery
,
for
two
hour
later
,
after
he
and
the
two
woman
have
escape
,
leave
the
house
-
party
to
their
own
diversion
,
the
stranger
be
find
lock
in
a
large
cupboard
and
insensible
.
<EOS>
the
sensation
be
a
tremendous
one
.
<EOS>
Cowan
,
the
doctor
,
be
call
,
and
declare
that
the
stranger
have
be
drug
and
be
suffer
from
some
narcotic
.
<EOS>
the

who
admit
him
declare
that
the
man
have
say
he
have
an
appointment
with
his
master
,
and
that
no
card
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
give
the
name
of
Chater
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Chater
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
start
up
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
certain
of
that
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
what
Cowan
tell
me
,
"
be
my
uncle
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
only
I
have
hear
that
name
before
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
a
man
out
in
Italy
of
the
same
name
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
visitor
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
hospital
at
dumfrie
.
<EOS>
They
take
him
there
in
preference
to
leave
him
alone
at
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
everyone
have
leave
,
now
the
host
and
hostess
have
slip
off
without
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
scandalous
affair
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
but
,
my
boy
,
you
will
remember
that
I
always
say
I
do
not
like
those
people
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
mysterious
about
them
,
I
feel
certain
.
<EOS>
that
telegram
give
them
warning
of
the
visit
of
the
man
Chater
,
depend
upon
it
,
and
for
some
reason
they
be
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
transpire
between
the
two
man
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
and
these
be
people
who
have
be
take
up
by
everybody
--
mere
adventurer
,
I
should
call
them
!
"
<EOS>
and
old
Sir
George
sniff
again
at
thought
of
such
scandal
happen
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
if
Gilrae
must
let
Rannoch
,
then
why
in
the
name
of
Fortune
do
not
he
let
it
to
respectable
folk
and
not
to
the
first
fellow
who
answer
his
advertisement
in
_
the
field
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
It
be
simply
disgraceful
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
it
be
a
most
extraordinary
story
,
"
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
evidently
wish
to
escape
from
his
visitor
,
and
that
be
why
he
drug
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
he
poison
him
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
Cowan
say
the
fellow
be
poison
,
but
that
he
will
probably
recover
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
conscious
,
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
call
on
the
doctor
,
who
happen
to
be
well
known
to
me
,
and
obtain
further
particular
.
<EOS>
therefore
at
eleven
o'clock
I
drive
into
dumfrie
and
enter
his
consulting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
spare
,
short
,
fair
man
,
a
trifle
bald
,
and
when
I
be
show
in
he
welcome
me
warmly
,
speak
with
his
pronounce
Galloway
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
a
very
mysterious
case
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
he
say
,
after
I
have
tell
him
the
object
of
my
visit
.
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
still
in
the
hospital
,
and
I
have
to
keep
him
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
be
poison
without
a
doubt
,
and
have
have
a
very
narrow
escape
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
police
get
wind
of
the
affair
,
and
Mackenzie
call
to
question
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
refuse
to
make
any
statement
whatever
,
apparently
treat
the
affair
very
lightly
.
<EOS>
the
police
,
however
,
be
mystify
as
to
the
reason
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
sudden
flight
,
and
be
anxious
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
curious
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
naturally
.
<EOS>
and
more
especially
after
the
tragedy
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
a
short
time
ago
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
it
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
remove
his
pince
-
nez
and
rub
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mackenzie
seem
to
suspect
some
connection
between
Leithcourt
's
sudden
disappearance
and
that
mysterious
affair
.
<EOS>
It
seem
very
evident
that
the
telegram
be
a
warning
to
Leithcourt
of
the
man
<EOS>
Chater
's
intention
of
call
,
and
that
the
last
-
name
be
show
in
just
at
the
moment
when
the
fugitive
be
on
the
point
of
leave
.
"
 
"
Chater
.
<EOS>
"
I
echo
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
his
christian
name
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hylton
Chater
.
<EOS>
He
be
apparently
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
curious
that
he
will
tell
us
nothing
of
the
reason
he
call
,
and
of
the
scene
that
occur
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
know
all
that
I
do
,
I
be
not
surprised
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
have
undoubtedly
take
him
unawares
,
but
knight
of
industry
never
betray
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
My
next
visit
be
to
Mackenzie
,
for
whom
I
have
to
wait
nearly
an
hour
,
as
he
be
absent
in
another
quarter
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
gladly
,
as
he
come
in
to
find
me
seat
in
a
chair
patiently
read
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
very
person
I
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
have
you
hear
of
this
strange
affair
at
Rannoch
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
be
my
answer
.
"
<EOS>
have
the
man
in
the
hospital
make
any
statement
yet
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
none
.
<EOS>
He
refuse
point
-
blank
,
"
answer
the
detective
.
<EOS>
"
but
my
own
idea
be
that
the
affair
have
a
very
close
connection
with
the
two
mystery
of
the
wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
first
mystery
--
<EOS>
that
of
the
man
--
prove
to
be
a
double
mystery
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
<EOS>
explain
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
the
waiter
Olinto
Santini
be
alive
and
well
in
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasp
,
start
up
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
be
not
the
person
you
identify
him
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
masquerade
as
Santini
--
make
up
to
resemble
him
,
I
mean
,
even
to
the
mole
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
identify
him
positively
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
when
a
person
be
dead
it
be
very
easy
to
mistake
countenance
.
<EOS>
death
alter
the
countenance
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
he
say
reflectively
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
the
man
we
have
bury
be
not
the
Italian
,
then
the
mystery
be
considerably
increase
.
<EOS>
why
be
the
real
man
's
wife
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
where
have
her
body
be
conceal
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
again
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
We
have
make
a
thorough
search
for
four
day
,
without
discover
any
trace
of
it
.
<EOS>
quite
confidentially
,
I
be
wonder
if
this
man
Chater
know
anything
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
,
to
say
the
least
,
that
the
Leithcourts
should
have
flee
so
hurriedly
on
this
man
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
have
you
actually
see
Olinto
Santini
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
have
speak
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
send
up
to
London
ask
that
inquiry
should
be
make
at
the
restaurant
in
Bayswater
,
but
up
to
the
present
I
have
receive
no
report
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
chat
with
Olinto
.
<EOS>
His
wife
have
mysteriously
disappear
,
but
he
be
in
ignorance
that
she
be
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
tell
him
anything
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
do
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
widespread
conspiracy
here
,
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
an
interesting
case
when
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
this
fellow
Chater
would
tell
us
the
reason
he
call
upon
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
merely
that
he
have
no
wish
to
prosecute
,
and
that
he
have
no
statement
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
can
not
you
compel
him
to
say
something
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
infernal
difficulty
of
it
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
choose
to
speak
,
then
we
must
still
remain
in
ignorance
,
although
I
feel
confident
that
he
know
something
of
the
strange
affair
up
in
the
wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
although
I
be
silent
,
I
share
the
Scotch
detective
's
belief
.
 
<EOS>
the
afternoon
be
chill
and
wet
as
I
climb
the
hill
to
Greenlaw
.
 
<EOS>
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
be
,
I
find
,
on
everyone
's
tongue
in
dumfrie
.
<EOS>
in
the
smoke
-
room
of
the
railway
hotel
three
man
be
discuss
it
with
many
grimace
and
sinister
hint
,
and
the
talkative
young
woman
behind
the
bar
ask
me
my
opinion
of
the
strange
going
-
on
up
at
the
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
walk
on
alone
,
with
the
dark
line
of
wood
crown
the
hill
-
top
before
me
,
the
scene
of
that
double
tragedy
,
I
again
calmly
review
the
situation
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
see
Hylton
Chater
,
yet
when
I
recollect
the
part
he
have
play
with
Hornby
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
,
I
naturally
hesitate
.
<EOS>
He
be
ally
with
Hornby
,
apparently
against
Leithcourt
,
although
the
latter
be
Hornby
's
friend
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
have
transpire
in
the
library
of
that
gray
old
castle
which
stand
out
boldly
before
me
,
dark
and
grim
,
as
I
plod
on
through
the
rain
?
<EOS>
how
have
Leithcourt
succeed
in
render
his
enemy
insensible
and
hide
him
in
that
cupboard
?
<EOS>
do
he
believe
that
he
have
kill
him
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
go
boldly
to
Chater
,
then
it
would
only
be
the
betrayal
of
myself
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
decide
that
the
man
who
have
smoke
and
chat
with
me
so
affably
on
that
hot
,
breathless
night
in
the
Mediterranean
must
remain
in
ignorance
of
my
presence
,
or
of
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
stay
for
a
week
at
Greenlaw
with
eye
and
ear
ever
open
,
yet
exercise
care
that
the
patient
in
the
hospital
should
be
unaware
of
my
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Mackenzie
see
him
on
several
occasion
,
but
he
still
persist
in
that
tantalizing
silence
.
<EOS>
the
inquiry
into
the
death
of
the
unidentified
man
in
Rannoch
Wood
have
be
resume
,
and
a
verdict
return
of
willful
murder
against
some
person
unknown
,
while
of
the
second
crime
the
public
have
no
knowledge
,
for
the
body
be
not
discover
.
 
<EOS>
time
after
time
I
search
the
wood
alone
,
on
the
pretense
of
shoot
pigeon
,
but
discover
nothing
.
<EOS>
when
not
have
sport
on
my
uncle
's
property
,
I
join
various
party
in
the
neighborhood
,
not
because
Scotland
at
that
time
attract
me
,
but
because
I
desire
to
watch
event
.
 
<EOS>
Chater
,
as
soon
as
he
recover
,
leave
the
hospital
and
go
south
--
to
London
,
I
ascertain
--
leave
the
police
utterly
in
the
dark
and
fill
with
suspicion
of
the
fugitive
from
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
Muriel
,
hope
to
gain
from
her
some
information
regard
their
visitor
who
have
so
nearly
escape
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
aware
of
the
object
of
his
visit
be
plain
from
the
statement
of
the
servant
,
all
of
whom
have
be
leave
without
either
money
or
order
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
I
call
at
the
castle
,
the
front
entrance
of
which
I
find
closed
.
<EOS>
Gilrae
,
the
owner
,
have
come
up
from
London
,
meet
his
factor
there
,
and
discharge
all
the
late
tenant
's
servant
,
keep
on
only
three
of
his
own
who
have
be
in
service
there
for
a
number
of
year
.
<EOS>
Ann
Cameron
,
a
housemaid
,
be
one
of
these
,
and
it
be
she
whom
I
meet
when
enter
by
the
servant
'
hall
.
 
<EOS>
on
question
her
,
I
find
her
most
willing
to
describe
how
she
be
in
the
corridor
outside
the
young
mistress
's
room
when
Mr.
Leithcourt
dash
along
in
breathless
haste
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
hear
him
cry
:
"
<EOS>
look
at
this
!
<EOS>
read
it
,
Muriel
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
.
<EOS>
put
on
your
thing
at
once
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
never
mind
about
luggage
.
<EOS>
every
minute
lose
be
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cry
a
moment
later
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
go
?
<EOS>
You
will
stay
here
--
stay
here
and
face
them
?
<EOS>
good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
girl
,
be
you
mad
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
what
this
mean
?
<EOS>
It
mean
that
the
secret
be
out
--
the
secret
be
out
,
you
hear
!
<EOS>
We
must
fly
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
woman
tell
me
that
she
distinctly
hear
Miss
Muriel
sob
,
while
her
father
walk
up
and
down
the
room
speak
rapidly
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
then
he
come
out
again
and
return
to
his
dressing
-
room
,
while
Miss
Muriel
presumably
change
from
her
evening
-
gown
into
a
dark
traveling
-
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
she
say
anything
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
that
they
be
call
away
suddenly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
the
domestic
add
,
"
the
young
lady
be
very
pale
and
agitated
,
and
we
all
know
that
something
terrible
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
give
order
that
nothing
be
to
be
tell
to
the
guest
,
who
dine
alone
,
believe
that
their
host
and
hostess
have
go
down
to
the
village
to
see
an
old
man
who
be
die
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
story
we
tell
them
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
in
the
meantime
the
Leithcourts
be
in
the
express
go
to
Carlisle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
say
in
dumfrie
that
the
police
telegraph
after
them
,
but
they
have
reach
Carlisle
and
evidently
change
there
,
and
so
get
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
the
administration
of
a
judicious
tip
I
be
allow
to
go
up
to
Miss
Muriel
's
room
,
an
elegantly
furnish
little
chamber
in
the
front
of
the
fine
old
place
,
with
a
deep
old
-
fashioned
window
command
a
magnificent
view
across
the
broad
Nithsdale
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
have
be
tidy
by
the
maid
,
but
allow
to
remain
just
as
she
have
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
advance
to
the
window
,
in
which
be
set
the
large
dressing
-
table
with
its
big
swing
-
mirror
and
silver
-
top
bottle
,
and
on
gaze
out
saw
,
to
my
surprise
,
it
be
the
only
window
which
give
a
view
of
that
corner
of
Rannoch
Wood
where
the
double
tragedy
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
any
person
stand
at
the
spot
would
have
a
clear
view
of
that
one
distant
window
while
out
of
sight
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
a
light
may
be
place
there
at
night
as
signal
,
for
instance
;
or
by
day
a
towel
may
be
hang
from
the
window
as
though
to
dry
and
yet
could
be
plainly
see
at
that
distance
.
 
<EOS>
another
object
in
the
room
also
attract
my
attention
--
a
pair
of
long
field
-
glass
.
<EOS>
have
she
use
these
to
keep
watch
upon
that
spot
?
 
<EOS>
I
take
them
up
and
focus
them
upon
the
boundary
of
the
wood
,
find
that
I
could
distinguish
everything
quite
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
where
they
find
the
man
who
be
murder
,
"
explain
the
servant
,
who
still
stand
in
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
just
try
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
then
I
put
them
down
,
and
on
turn
see
upon
the
mantelshelf
a
small
,
bright
-
red
candleshade
,
which
I
take
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
make
,
I
find
,
to
fit
upon
the
electric
table
-
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Muriel
be
very
fond
of
a
red
light
,
"
explain
the
young
woman
;
and
as
I
hold
it
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
that
light
have
ever
be
place
upon
the
toilet
-
table
and
the
blind
draw
up
--
whether
it
have
ever
be
use
as
a
warning
of
danger
?
 
<EOS>
as
I
express
a
desire
to
see
the
young
lady
's
boudoir
,
the
maid
Cameron
take
me
down
to
the
luxurious
little
room
where
,
the
first
moment
I
enter
,
one
fact
strike
me
as
peculiar
.
<EOS>
the
picture
of
Elma
Heath
be
no
longer
there
.
<EOS>
the
photograph
have
be
take
from
its
frame
,
and
in
its
place
be
the
portrait
of
a
broad
-
browe
,
full
-
bearded
man
in
a
foreign
military
uniform
--
a
picture
that
,
be
soil
and
fade
,
have
evidently
be
place
there
to
fill
the
empty
frame
.
 
<EOS>
whose
hand
have
secure
that
portrait
before
the
Leithcourt
's
flight
?
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
,
should
I
,
for
the
second
time
,
discover
the
unhappy
girl
's
picture
missing
?
 
<EOS>
"
have
the
gentleman
who
call
on
the
evening
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
disappearance
be
back
here
again
since
he
leave
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
as
a
sudden
idea
occur
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
call
here
in
a
fly
on
the
day
he
come
out
,
and
at
his
request
I
take
him
over
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
library
,
and
spend
half
-
an
-
hour
in
pacing
across
it
,
take
measurement
,
and
examine
the
big
cupboard
in
which
he
be
find
insensible
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
affair
,
sir
,
"
add
the
young
woman
,
"
be
not
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
,
"
I
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
gentleman
may
have
be
in
there
now
have
I
not
go
into
the
library
and
find
a
lot
of
illustrate
paper
,
which
I
always
put
in
the
cupboard
to
keep
the
place
tidy
,
throw
out
on
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
put
them
back
but
discover
the
door
lock
.
<EOS>
the
key
I
afterwards
find
in
the
grate
,
where
Mr.
Leithcourt
have
evidently
throw
it
,
and
on
open
the
door
imagine
the
shock
I
have
when
I
find
the
visitor
lying
double
up
.
<EOS>
I
,
of
course
,
think
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
when
he
return
here
on
his
recovery
,
do
he
question
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
ask
about
the
Leithcourts
,
and
especially
about
Miss
Muriel
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
rather
sweet
on
her
,
by
the
way
he
speak
.
<EOS>
and
really
no
better
or
kind
lady
never
breathe
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
very
sorry
indeed
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
she
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
but
she
share
in
the
scandal
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
see
the
effect
of
the
news
upon
the
guest
when
they
know
that
the
Leithcourts
have
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
regular
pandemonium
.
<EOS>
They
order
the
good
champagne
out
of
the
cellar
and
drank
it
,
the
man
clear
all
the
cigar
-
box
,
and
the
woman
rummage
in
the
wardrobe
until
they
seem
like
a
pack
of
hungry
wolf
.
<EOS>
everybody
go
away
with
their
trunk
full
of
the
Leithcourt
's
thing
.
<EOS>
They
take
whatever
they
could
lay
their
hand
on
,
and
we
,
the
servant
,
could
not
stop
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
remonstrate
with
one
lady
who
be
cram
into
her
trunk
two
of
Miss
Muriel
's
good
evening
dress
,
but
she
tell
me
to
mind
my
own
business
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
one
man
I
see
go
away
with
four
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
gun
,
and
there
be
a
regular
squabble
in
the
billiard
-
room
over
a
set
of
pearl
and
emerald
dress
-
stud
that
somebody
find
in
his
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Crane
,
the
valet
,
say
they
toss
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Disgraceful
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculate
.
<EOS>
"
then
as
soon
as
the
host
and
hostess
have
go
,
they
simply
sweep
through
the
room
and
clear
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
take
away
all
that
be
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
have
the
silver
,
only
Mason
have
throw
it
into
the
plate
-
chest
,
all
dirty
as
it
be
,
lock
it
up
and
hide
the
key
.
<EOS>
the
plate
be
Mr.
Gilrae
's
,
you
know
,
sir
,
and
Mason
be
responsible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
act
wisely
,
"
I
say
,
surprised
at
the
domestic
's
story
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
guest
act
like
a
gang
of
thief
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
rush
all
over
the
house
like
demon
let
loose
,
and
they
even
steal
some
of
our
thing
.
<EOS>
I
lose
a
silver
chain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
the
stranger
say
when
you
tell
him
of
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
smile
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
seem
to
surprise
him
in
the
least
,
for
after
all
his
visit
be
the
cause
of
<EOS>
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
party
,
be
not
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
show
him
over
the
whole
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
respond
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
curiously
enough
he
have
with
him
what
seem
to
be
a
large
plan
of
the
castle
,
and
as
we
go
from
room
to
room
he
compare
it
with
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
be
here
for
hour
,
and
tell
me
he
want
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
place
and
do
not
want
to
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
He
also
say
that
he
may
probably
take
the
place
for
next
season
,
if
he
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
he
only
tell
me
this
because
he
think
I
would
be
more
patient
while
he
take
his
measurement
and
make
his
investigation
.
<EOS>
He
be
here
from
twelve
till
nearly
six
o'clock
,
and
go
through
every
room
,
even
up
to
the
turret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
come
into
this
room
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
she
respond
,
with
just
a
slight
hesitation
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
room
where
he
stay
the
long
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
photograph
in
that
frame
over
there
,
"
she
add
,
indicate
the
frame
that
have
hold
the
picture
of
Elma
Heath
,
"
a
portrait
of
a
young
lady
,
which
he
beg
me
to
give
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
give
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
--
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
beg
so
hard
for
it
,
say
that
it
be
the
portrait
of
a
friend
of
his
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
give
you
something
handsome
for
it
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
young
woman
,
whom
I
know
could
not
refuse
half
-
a
-
sovereign
,
color
slightly
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
put
that
picture
in
its
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
tell
you
who
the
young
lady
be
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
only
say
that
that
be
the
only
photograph
that
exist
,
and
that
she
be
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
dead
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
,
stare
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
he
be
so
anxious
for
the
picture
.
"
 
<EOS>
Elma
Heath
dead
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
true
?
<EOS>
that
sweet
-
pictured
face
haunt
me
as
no
other
face
have
ever
impress
itself
upon
my
memory
.
<EOS>
It
somehow
seem
to
impel
me
to
endeavor
to
penetrate
the
mystery
,
and
yet
Hylton
Chater
have
declare
that
she
be
dead
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
the
remarkable
letter
from
Abo
,
and
her
own
declaration
that
her
end
be
near
.
<EOS>
that
letter
be
,
she
say
,
the
last
she
should
write
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
do
Hylton
Chater
actually
possess
knowledge
of
the
girl
's
death
?
<EOS>
have
he
all
along
be
acquaint
with
her
whereabouts
?
<EOS>
what
the
young
woman
tell
me
upset
all
my
plan
.
<EOS>
if
Elma
Heath
be
really
dead
,
then
she
be
beyond
discovery
,
and
the
truth
would
be
hide
forever
.
 
<EOS>
"
after
he
have
put
the
photograph
in
his
pocket
,
the
gentleman
make
a
most
minute
search
in
this
room
,
"
the
domestic
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
He
consult
his
plan
,
take
several
measurement
,
and
then
tap
on
the
paneling
all
along
this
wall
,
as
though
he
be
search
for
some
hide
cupboard
or
hiding
place
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
plan
,
and
see
a
mark
in
red
ink
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
try
to
discover
that
spot
,
and
be
greatly
disappointed
at
not
be
able
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
here
over
an
hour
,
and
make
a
most
careful
search
all
around
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
explanation
do
he
give
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
only
say
,
'
if
I
find
what
I
want

shall
make
you
a
present

naturally
make
me
anxious

He
make
no
other
remark
about
the
young
lady
's
death
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
only
he
sigh
,
and
look
steadily
for
a
long
time
at
the
photograph
.
<EOS>
I
see
his
lip
move
,
but
his
word
be
inaudible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
any
idea
of
the
reason
why
he
call
upon
Mr.

I

<EOS>
"
from
what
he

I
have
form
my

conclusion

be
her
answer

<EOS>
"
and
what
be
your
opinion

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
feel
certain
that
there
be
,

be

something
conceal
in

very
anxious

obtain

He
come
to
demand
it
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
,
but
what
happen
in

do
not

<EOS>
He
,
however
,
believe
that
Mr.

not
take
it
away
,
and
that
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
it
be
still
hide
here

CHAPTER
<EOS>
X
 
<EOS>
I
show
my
hand
  
<EOS>
on
my
return
to
London
next
day
I
make
inquiry
at
the
Admiralty
and
learn
that
the
battleship
_
Bulwark
_
be
lie
at
Palermo
,
therefore
I
telegraph
to
Jack
Durnford
,
and
late
the
same
afternoon
his
reply
come
at
the
Cecil:--
 
"
_
Due
in
London
twentieth
.
<EOS>
dine
with
me
at
club
that
evening_--jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
twentieth
!
<EOS>
that
mean
nearly
a
month
of
inactivity
.
<EOS>
in
that
time
I
could
cross
to
Abo
,
make
inquiry
there
,
and
ascertain
,
perhaps
,
if
Elma
Heath
be
actually
dead
as
Chater
have
declare
.
 
<EOS>
two
fact
strike
me
as
remarkable
:
Baron
Oberg
be
say
to
be
polish
,
while
the
dark
-
bearded
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
in
Westbourne
Grove
be
also
of
the
same
nationality
.
<EOS>
then
I
recollect
that
pretty
little
enamel
cross
that
Mackenzie
have
find
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
and
it
suddenly
occur
to
me
that
it
may
possibly
be
the
miniature
of
one
of
the
european
order
of
chivalry
.
<EOS>
in
the
club
library
at
midnight
I
find
a
copy
of
Cappelletti
's
_
Storia
degli
Ordini
Cavallereschi
_
,
the
standard
work
on
the
subject
,
and
on
search
the
illustration
<EOS>
I
at
length
discover
a
picture
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
russian
order
--
the
covet
order
of
Saint
Anne
,
bestow
by
the
Czar
only
upon
person
who
have
render
eminent
service
to
the
state
and
to
the
sovereign
.
<EOS>
one
fact
be
now
certain
,
namely
,
that
the
owner
of
that
tiny
cross
,
the
small
replica
of
the
fine
decoration
,
must
be
a
person
of
high
official
standing
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
spend
in
make
inquiry
with
a
view
to
discover
the
house
say
to
be
occupy
by
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
not
either
in
the
Directory
or
the
Blue
Book
,
I
conclude
that
he
have
perhaps
rent
it
furnish
,
and
after
many
inquiry
and
considerable
difficulty
I
find
that
such
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
He
have
occupy
the
house
of
Lady
Heathcote
,
a
few
door
from
Grosvenor
Square
,
for
the
previous
season
,
although
he
have
live
there
but
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
where
the
fugitive
be
in
hiding
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
meet
Muriel
again
and
tell
her
what
I
have
discover
,
yet
it
be
plain
that
the
trio
be
conceal
themselves
from
Hylton
Chater
,
whom
I
suppose
to
be
now
back
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
autumn
day
be
dull
and
rainy
,
and
the
street
be
muddy
and
unpleasant
,
as
they
always
be
at
the
fall
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
compel
to
remain
inactive
,
I
idle
in
the
club
with
the
recollection
of
that
picture
face
ever
before
me
--
the
face
of
the
unfortunate
girl
who
wish
<EOS>
her
last
message
to
be
convey
to
Philip
Hornby
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
be
her
secret
?
<EOS>
what
be
really
her
fate
?
 
<EOS>
this
latter
question
trouble
me
until
I
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
it
be
my
duty
to
go
to
Finland
and
endeavor
to
learn
something
regard
this
Baron
Oberg
and
his
niece
.
<EOS>
Frank
Hutcheson
have
write
me
declare
that
the
weather
in
Leghorn
be
now
perfect
,
and
express
wonder
that
I
do
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
be
his
only
english
friend
,
and
I
know
how
dull
he
be
when
alone
.
<EOS>
even
his
Majesty
's
Consuls
sometimes
suffer
from
homesickness
,
and
long
for
the
smell
of
the

you

my
reader
,
who
have
live
in
a
foreign
land
for
any
length
of
time
,
know
<EOS>
well
how
wearisome
become
the
life
,
however
brilliant
,
and
how
sweet
be
the
recollection
of
our
dear
gray
old
England
with
her
green
field
,
her
muddy
lane
,
and
the
bustling
street
of
her
gray
,
grimy
city
.
<EOS>
You
have
but
one
"
home

"
and
England
be
still
your
home
,
even
though
you
may
become
the
most
bigoted
of
cosmopolitan

may
have
no
opportunity
of

your

Duty
--
the
duty
of
a
man
who
have
learn
strange
fact
and
know
that
a
defenseless
woman
be
a
victim
--
call
me
to
Finland
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
with
my
passport
properly
vise
and
my
paper
all
in

I
one
night
leave
Hull
for

by

me
to
the

whence
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
I
take
the
small

which
ply
three
time
a
week
around
the
Aland
Islands
,

then
across
the

,
and
through
the
intricate
channel
and
among
those
low

lie
island
to
the
gray
lethargic
town
of
Abo
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first
occasion
on
which
I
have
trod
russian
soil
,
and
I
know
too
well
the
annoyance
of
the
bureaucracy
.
<EOS>
Finland
,
however
,
be
perhaps
the
most
severely
govern
of
any
of
the
Czar
's
dominion
,
and
I
have
my
first
taste
of
its
stern
,
relentless
officialdom
at
the
moment
of
land
on
the
half

desert
quay

<EOS>
in

whereupon
the
man
shake
his
head
and
hand
back
the
document
curtly
,
say
in
Russian

which
I
understand
fairly
well
,
although
I
speak
badly--
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
and
I
leave
the

very
satisfied
that
I
have
turn
his
officiousness
and
hatred
of
the
English

very
good

<EOS>
on

dreary

<EOS>
Poor

<EOS>
idle
in
sleepy
Abo
,
where
the
public
building
be
so
mean
and
meager
and
the
house
for

part
build
of
wood

I
see
on

the
disastrous

of
the
attempt
Russification

the

My

traveler
from
Stockholm

who

in
Hamburg

and
who
pay
an

Helsingfors

act
as
my
guide
around
the
town

while
I
await
the
information
from
the
humble
Chief
of
Police

<EOS>
My
german
friend
point
out
to
me
how
,
since
Russia
place
her
hand
upon
Finland
,
progress
have
be
arrest
,
and
certainly
plain
evidence
be
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
grow
discontent
everywhere
,
for
many
of
the
newspaper
have
recently
be
suppress
and
the
remainder
be
under
a
severe
censorship
;
agriculture
have
already
decrease
,
and
many
of
the
cotton
-
spinning
and
saw
mill
be
silent
and
desert
.
<EOS>
the
exploitation
of
those
gigantic
forest
from
which
million
of
trunk
be
float
down
to
the
sea
annually
have
now
be
suspend
,
the
great
landowner
be
desert
the
country
,
and
there
be
silence
and
depression
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Finland
have
be
separate
for
economic
purpose
from
the
more
civilized
country
,
and
bind
to
the
poverty
-
stricken
,
artificially
isolate
and
oppress
Russia
.
<EOS>
the
double

head
eagle
be
everywhere

and
the
people
sit
silent
and
brood
beneath
its
black
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
an
uprising
here
before
long
,
"
declare
the
german
confidentially
,
as
we
be
take
tea
one
day
on
the
wooden
balcony
of
the
hotel
where
the
sea
and
the
low
-
lie
island
stretch
out
before
us
in
the
pale
yellow
of
the
autumn
sundown
.
<EOS>
"
the
people
will
revolt
,
as
they
do
in
Poland
.
<EOS>
the
finnish
Government
can
only
appeal
to
the
Czar
through
the
Governor

General
,
and
one
can
easily
imagine
that
their
suggestion
never
reach
the
Emperor

<EOS>
It
be

here
that
the
harsh
and
more
corrupt
the
official
,
the
great
honor
do
he
receive
from
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
but
trouble
be
brew
for
Russia
,
"
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
a
very
serious
trouble
--
depend
upon
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
look
upon
the
gray
dismal
scene
,
the
empty
port
,
the
silent
quay
,
the
dark
line
of
gloomy
pine
forest
away
beyond
the
town
,
the
break
coast
and
the
wide
expanse
of
water
glitter
in
the
northern
sunset
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
the
very
silence
seem
to
forbode
evil
and
mystery
.
<EOS>
truly
what
I
see
of
Finland
impress
me
even
more
than
what
I
have
witness
in
the
far
-
off
eastern
province
of
European
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
My
object
,
however
,
be
not
to
inquire
into
the
internal
condition
of
Finland
,
or
of
her
resentment
of
her
powerful
conqueror
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
to
find
that
unfortunate
girl
who
have
write
so
strangely
to
her
old
school
friend
and
whose
portrait
have
,
for
some
hide
reason
,
be
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
my
arrival
at
Abo
,
while
sit
on
the
hotel
veranda
read
an
old
copy
of
the
Paris
_
Journal
_
,
many
portion
of
which
have
be
"

out

by

Chief

in
his
dark
green
uniform

enter
and
salute
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Excellency
,
may
I
be
permit
to
speak
with
you
in
private
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
respond
,
rise
and
conduct
him
to
my
bedroom
,
where
I
close
the
door
,
invite
him
to
a
seat
,
and
myself
sit
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
My
information
,
however
,
must
be
furnish
to
you
in
strict
confidence

he
add
,
"
because
there
be
reason

<EOS>
"
what
do

I

<EOS>
"
I

she
be
dead

"
 
<EOS>
"
to
the
world
she

"
respond
Michael
Boranski

stroke
his
red

<EOS>
"
for
that
reason
the
information
I
give
you
must
be
treat
as
confidential

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
she
be
in
hiding
?
<EOS>
She
be
guilty
of
no

--
be
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
man
shrug
his
shoulder
,
but
do
not
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
this
Baron
Oberg
?
<EOS>
You
tell

I
say
with
dissatisfaction

<EOS>
"
how
can

be
his
response
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
that
the
fellow
be
not

the
truth

for
I
have
notice
his
surprise
when
I
have
first
utter
the
mysterious
nobleman

<EOS>
"
as
I
have
already

I

the

I

but
I

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
away
in

<EOS>
if
your

be
down
at

at

you
will
find
a

and
the

will
have
full
instruction
how

how

<EOS>
follow
his

implicitly

<EOS>

I
cry
anxiously

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
not
to

day
?
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
go
at
any
moment

"
 
<EOS>
the
Chief
of
Police
remain
thoughtful
for
a
few
moment
,
then
said--
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
I
could
find
the
man

you
may
go
to

<EOS>
yet
it

"
 
<EOS>
"
the
road
be
safe

I
suppose

<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
drive
in
the
night

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
official
glance
at
the
clock
,
and
rise
exclaimed--
 
<EOS>
"
very
well

I
will
send
for
the
man

if
we
find
him

then

hour

at

<EOS>
very
well

<EOS>
I
shall
keep

"
 
<EOS>
"
and
after
see
her
,
you
will
of
course
keep
your
promise
of
secrecy
regard
our
little
misunderstanding
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
give
my
word
,
"
be
the
response
;
and
the
man
bow
and
leave
,
much
,
I
think
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
hotel
-
proprietor
and
his
staff
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
unusual
thing
for
such
a
high
official
as
the
Chief
of
Police
to
visit
one
of
their
guest
in
person
.
<EOS>
if
he
desire
to
interview
any
of
them
,
he
command
them
to
attend
at
his
office
,
or
they
be
escort
there
by
his
gray
-
coated
agent
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
cold
,
with
a
biting
wind
from
the
icy
north
,
when
after
a
hasty
luncheon
I
put
on
my
overcoat
and
stroll
along
the
desert
quay
where
I
lounge
at
the
further
end
,
watch
the
approach
of
a
great
pontoon
of
pine
log
that
have
apparently
float
out
of
one
of
the
river
and
be
now
be
navigate
to
the
port
by
four
man
who
seem
every
moment
in
imminent
danger
of
be
wash
off
the
raft
into
the
sea
as
the
wave
break
over
and
drench
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
however
,
lash
themselves
to
their
raft
,
I
see
,
and
now
slowly
pilot
the
great
float
platform
towards
the
quay
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
have
wait
half
an
hour
,
when
my
attention
be
suddenly
attract
by
the
rattle
of
wheel
over
the
stone
,
and
turn
<EOS>
I
see
an
old
closed
carriage
draw
by
three
horse
abreast
,
with
bell
upon
the
harness
,
approach
me
rapidly
.
<EOS>
when
it
draw
up
,
the
driver
,
a
burly
-
looking
,
fair
-
head
Finn
in
a
huge
sheepskin
overcoat
,
motion
me
to
enter
,
urge
in
broken
Russian--
 
"
quickly
,
Excellency!--quickly!--you
must
not
be
see
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
instant
I
be
seat
,
<EOS>
and
before
I
could
close
the
door
,
the
horse
plunge
forward
and
we
be
tear
at
full
gallop
out
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
for
five
mile
<EOS>
or
so
we
skirt
the
sea
along
a
level
,
well
-
make
road
through
a
barren
wind
-
sweep
country
<EOS>
whence
the
meager
harvest
have
already
be
garner
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
village
.
<EOS>
all
around
be
a
houseless
land
,
rolling
mile
of
brown
and
green
,
break
and
checker
by
bit
of
forest
and
clump
of
dark
melancholy
pine
.
<EOS>
the
road
run
ever
and
anon
right
down
to
where
the
cold
,
green
wave
break
upon
the
rocky
shore
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
week
that
coast
would
be
ice
-
bind
and
snow
-
cover
,
and
then
the
silence
of
the
God
-
forsake
country
would
be
complete
.
 
<EOS>
after
five
mile
or
so
,
the
driver
pull
up
and
descend
to
readjust
his
harness
,
whereupon
I
get
out
and
ask
him
in
the
good
russian
I
could
command
:
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
Nystad
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
far
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
sixty
-
eight
,
"
be
his
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
him
to
imply
kilometre
,
as
be
a
Finn
he
would
not
speak
of
verst
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Chief
of
Police
have
give
you
direction
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
high
Excellency
have
tell
me
exactly
what
to
do
,
"
be
the
man
's
answer
,
as
he
take
out
his
huge
wooden
pipe
and
fill
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
see
the
young
lady
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
answer
,
"
to
first
see
her
,
and
I
do
not
know
whether
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
make
myself
known
to
her
.
<EOS>
where
be
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beyond
Nystad
,
"
be
his
vague
answer
with
a
wave
of
his
big
fat
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
dark
pine
forest
that
stretch
before
us
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
there
about
an
hour
after
sundown
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
I
re
-
enter
the
stuffy
old
conveyance
that
rock
and
roll
as
we
dash
away
over
the
uneven
forest
road
,
and
sit
wonder
to
what
manner
of
place
I
be
be
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
Heath
be
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
I
recollect
her
curious
letter
and
remember
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
wish
Hornby
to
know
that
she
have
never
reveal
her
secret
.
<EOS>
what
secret
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
I
light
an
abominable
cigar
,
and
try
to
smoke
,
but
I
be
too
fill
with
anxiety
,
too
bewilder
by
the
maze
of
mystery
in
which
I
now
find
myself
.
<EOS>
two
hour
later
we
pull
up
before
a
long
log
-
build
post
-
house
just
beyond
a
small
town
in
a
hollow
that
face
the
sea
,
and
I
alight
to
watch
the
steam
horse
be
replace
by
a
trio
of
fresh
one
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
Dadendal
,
I
be
inform
,
and
the
proprietor
of
the
place
,
when
I
enter
and
toss
off
a
liqueur
-
glass
of
cognac
,
point
out
to
me
a
row
of
granite
building
fall
much
to
decay
as
the
ancient
convent
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
resume
our
journey
,
the
short
day
quickly
draw
to
a
close
,
the
sun
sink
yellow
and
watery
over
the
tower
pine
through
which
we
go
mile
after
mile
,
a
dense
,
interminable

the

lurk

dangerous

<EOS>
the
temperature
fall
,
and
it
freeze
again
.
<EOS>
through
the
window
in
front
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
big
Finn
driver
throw
his
arm
across
his
shoulder
to
promote
circulation
,
in
the
same
manner
as
do
the
London
"
cabby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
night
draw
on
we
change
horse
again
at
a
small
,
dirty
post
-
house
in
the
forest
,
at
the
edge
of
a
lake
,
and
then
push
forward
again
,
although
it
be
already
long
past
the
hour
at
which
he
have
say
we
should
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
Time
pass
slowly
in
the
darkness
,
for
we
have
no
light
,
and
the
horse
seem
to
find
their
way
by
instinct
.
<EOS>
the
rolling
of
the
lumber
old
vehicle
after
six
hour
have
render
me
sleepy
,
I
think
,
for
I
recollect
close
my
eye
and
conjure
up
that
strange
scene
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
suppose
I
must
have
sleep
,
for
I
be
awaken
by
a
light
shine
into
my
face
and
the
driver
shake
me
by
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
when
I
rouse
myself
and
,
naturally
,
inquire
the
reason
,
he
place
his
finger
mysteriously
upon
my
lip
,
say
:
 
"
Hush
,
your
high
nobility
,
hush
!
<EOS>
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
make
no
noise
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
discover
,
it
mean
death
for
us
--
death
.
<EOS>
come
,
give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
slowly
.
<EOS>
tread
softly
.
<EOS>
see
,
here
be
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
in
first
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
hear
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
fellow
lead
me
,
half
-
dazed
,
down
to
the
bank
of
a
broad
,
dark
river
which
I
could
just
distinguish
--
he
lead
me
to
an
unknown
bourne
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
XI
 
<EOS>
the
castle
of
the
TERROR
  
<EOS>
the
big
Finn
have
,
I
find
,
tie
up
his
horse
,
and
in
the
heavy
old
boat
he
row
me
down
the
swollen
river
which
run
swift
and
turbulent
around
a
sudden
bend
and
then
seem
to
open
out
to
a
great
width
.
<EOS>
in
the
starlight
I
could
distinguish
that
it
stretch
gray
and
level
to
a
distance
,
and
that
the
opposite
bank
be
fringe
with
pine
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
my
guide
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
but
he
only
whisper
:
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
Excellency
!
<EOS>
remain
patient
,
and
you
shall
see
the
young
Englishwoman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
sit
in
the
boat
,
while
he
allow
it
to
drift
with
the
current
,
steer
it
with
the
great
heavy
oar
.
<EOS>
the
river
suddenly
narrow
again
,
with
high
pine
on
either
bank
,
a
silent
,
lonesome
reach
,
perhaps
indeed
one
of
the
lonely
spot
in
all
Europe
.
<EOS>
once
the
dismal
howl
of
a
wolf
sound
close
to
where
we
pass
,
but
my
guide
make
no
remark
.
 
<EOS>
after
nearly
a
mile
,
the
stream
again
open
out
into
a
broad
lake
where
,
in
the
distance
,
I
see
rise
sheer
and
high
from
the
water
,
a
long
square
building
of
three
story
,
with
a
tall
round
tower
at
one
corner
--
an
old
medieval
castle
it
seem
to
be
.
<EOS>
from
one
of
the
small
window
of
the
tower
,
as
we
come
into
view
of
it
,
a
light
be
shine
upon
the
water
,
and
my
guide
see
it
,
grunt
in
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
have
undoubtedly
be
place
there
as
signal
.
 
<EOS>
with
great
caution
he
approach
the
place
,
keep
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
bank
until
we
come
exactly
opposite
the
flanking
-
tower
.
<EOS>
in
the
light
window
I
distinctly
see
a
dark
figure
of
someone
appear
for
a
moment
,
and
then
my
guide
strike
a
match
and
hold
it
in
his
finger
until
it
be
wholly
consume
.
 
<EOS>
almost
instantly
the
light
be
extinguish
,
and
then
,
after
wait
five
minute
or
so
,
he
pull
straight
across
the
lake
to
the
high
,
dark
tower
that
descend
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
as
grim
and
silent
as
any
I
have
ever
see
,
an
impregnable
stronghold
of
the
day
before
siege
gun
be
invent
,
the
fortress
of
some
feudal
prince
or
count
who
have
probably
hold
the
surround
country
in
thraldom
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
against
the
black
,
slimy
wall
to
prevent
the
boat
bump
,
and
then
distinguish
just
beyond
me
a
small
wooden
ledge
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
step
which
lead
up
to
a
low
arched
door
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
open
noiselessly
,
and
the
dark
figure
of
a
woman
stand
peer
forth
.
 
<EOS>
My
guide
utter
some
reassuring
word
in
Finnish
in
a
low
half
-
whisper
,
and
then
slowly
push
the
boat
along
to
the
ledge
,
say
:
 
"
Your
high
nobility
may
disembark
.
<EOS>
there
be
at
present
no
danger
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
rise
,
grip
a
big
rusty
chain
to
steady
myself
,
and
climb
into
the
narrow
doorway
in
the
ponderous
wall
,
where
I
find
myself
in
the
darkness
beside
the
female
who
have
apparently
be
expect
our
arrival
and
watch
our
signal
.
 
<EOS>
without
a
word
she
lead
me
through
a
short
passage
,
and
then
,
strike
a
match
,
light
a
big
old
-
fashioned
lantern
.
<EOS>
as
the
light
fall
upon
her
feature
I
see
they
be
thin
and
hard
,
with
deep
-
set
eye
and
a
stray
wisp
of
silver
across
her
wrinkle
brow
.
<EOS>
around
her
head
be
a
kind
of
hood
of
the
same
stuff
as
her
dress
,
a
black
,
coarse
woolen
,
while
around
her
neck
be
a
broad
linen
collar
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
I
recognize
that
she
be
a
member
of
some
religious
order
,
some
minor
order
perhaps
,
with
whose
habit
we
,
in
Italy
,
be
not
acquaint
.
 
<EOS>
the
thin
ascetic
countenance
be
that
of
a
woman
of
strong
character
,
and
her
funereal
habit
seem
much
too
large
for
her
stunted
,
shrink
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
sister
speak
French
?
<EOS>
"
I
hazard
in
that
language
,
know
that
in
most
convent
throughout
Europe
French
be
know
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oui
,
m'sieur
,
"
be
her
answer
.
"
<EOS>
and
a
leetle
Engleesh
,
too
--
a
ve
-
ry
leetle
,
"
she
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
why
I
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
gratify
that
at
least
one
person
in
that
lonesome
country
could
speak
my
own
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
already
be
tell
,
"
be
her
answer
with
a
strong
accent
,
as
we
stand
in
that
small
,
bare
stone
room
,
a
semicircular
chamber
in
the
tower
,
once
perhaps
a
prison
.
"
<EOS>
but
be
you
not
afraid
to
venture
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
--
because
no
stranger
be
permit
here
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
if
your
presence
here
be
discover
you
would
not
leave
this
place
alive
--
so
I
warn
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
prepared
to
risk
that
,
"
I
say
,
smile
;
at
the
same
time
my
hand
instinctively
seek
my
hip
-
pocket
to
ascertain
that
my
weapon
be
safe
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
see
Miss
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
old
nun
nodded
,
fumble
with
her
lantern
.
<EOS>
I
glance
at
my
watch
and
find
that
it
be
already
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
remember
that
if
you
be
discover
here
you
exonerate
me
of
all
blame
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
raise
her
head
and
peer
into
my
face
with
her
keen
gray
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
admit
you
I
be
betray
my
trust
,
and
that
I
should
not
have
do
be
it
not
compulsory

"
 
<EOS>
"
Compulsory

<EOS>
how

"
 
<EOS>
"
the
order
of
the
Chief
of
Police
.
<EOS>
even
here
,
we
can
not
afford
to
offend
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
the
fellow
Boranski
have
really
keep
faith
with
me
,
and
at
his
order
the
closed
door
of
the
convent
have
be
open
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"

officialdom

all

powerful

Finland

<EOS>
but
where
be
the
lady

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
still
prepared
to
risk
your
liberty
and

"
<EOS>
she
ask
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
full
of
grim
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
lead
me
to
her

"
 
<EOS>
"
and
when
you
see
her
you
will
make

<EOS>
promise
me
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"

Sister
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
ask
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
me

<EOS>
I
come
here
from
England

nay
,
from
Italy
in
search
of
her
,
to
question
her
regard
a
strange
mystery

to

<EOS>
surely
I
may
be

speak
with

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
learn
the
truth
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
remark
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
her
lover

that
you
merely
wish
to
see
her
once
again

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

I
be
not

I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
we

that

she
say
,
in

hard

change
voice

<EOS>
"
because
there
be
a
conspiracy

preserve

I
cry

<EOS>
"
but
I
intend
to
solve
the
mystery

and
for
that
reason
I
have
travel
here
from
England

"
 
<EOS>
the
woman
with
the
lantern
smile
sadly
,
as
though
amuse
by
my
impetuosity
.
 
<EOS>
"

in

broken

shrug

without

sentence

"

<EOS>
It

four
year

ah

this

His

before

I
ask

the

give
me
no

exhibit
her
palm

sigh

She
seem
to
have
compassion
upon

where
do
this
Baron
live

I
ask
,
surprise
that
he
should
occupy
so
high
a
place

russian
officialdom

the
representative
of

Czar

with
power
as
great
as

himself

"
ah
,
m'sieur
,
how
can
I
tell

<EOS>
by
reason
of
family

perhaps

They
account

so
much

five

of

off

I
gasp

glance
round
at
those
dark
stone
wall

seem
to
breathe
an
air
of
tragedy
and
mystery

the
old
castle
have
,
I
suppose
,
be
turn
into
a
convent

as
many
have
be
in
Germany

Austria

you

here
long

I
ask

seven
year

be
leave

use
as
I

can
stand
it
no

I
feel
that
its
cold
silence
and
dreariness
will
drive
me
mad

in
winter
the
place
be
like
an
ice
-
well

"
 
<EOS>
the
fact
that
the
Baron
be
ruler
of
Finland
amaze
me
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
half
-
expect
him
to
be
some
clever
adventurer
.
<EOS>
yet
as
the
event
of
the
past
flash
through
my
brain
,
I
recollect
that
in
Rannoch
Wood
have
be
find
the
miniature

Saint
Anne

a
distinction

,
in

have

confer
upon
him

<EOS>
if
so
,
the
coincidence
,
to
say
the

,
be
a
remarkable
one

I
question
my
companion
further

the
Baron

"
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
something
of
this
abominable
state
of
affair
from
time
to
time
from
the
english
press
,
but
have
never
take
notice
of
the
name
of
the
oppressor
.
<EOS>
so
the
uncle
of
Elma
Heath
be
"
the
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
the
man
who
,
in
four
year
,
have
reduce
a
prosperous
country
to
a
state
of
ruin
and
revolt
!
 
<EOS>
"
can
not
I
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
feel
that
we
have
remain
too
long
there
.
<EOS>
if
my
presence
in
that
place
be
perilous
the
sooner
I
escape
from
it
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
come
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
silence
!
<EOS>
walk
softly
,
"
and
hold
up
the
old
horn
lantern
to
give
me
light
,
she
lead
me
out
into
the
low
stone
corridor
again
,
conduct
me
through
a
number
of
intricate
passage
,
all
bare
and
gloomy
<EOS>
,
the
stone
wear
hollow
by
the
foot
of
age
.
<EOS>
on
we
creep
noiselessly
past
a
number
of
low
arched
door
stud
with
big
nail
in
the
style
of
generation
ago
,
then
turn
suddenly
at
right
angle
,
I
see
that
we
be
in
a
kind
of
_
cul
de
sac
,
<EOS>
_
before
the
door
of
which
at
the
end
she
stop
and
place
her
finger
upon
her
lip
.
<EOS>
then
,
motion
me
to
remain
there
,
she
enter
,
close
the
door
after
her
,
and
leave
me
in
the
pitch
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
I
strain
my
ear
,
but
could
hear
no
sound
save
that
of
someone
move
within
.
<EOS>
no
word
be
utter
,
or
if
so
,
it
be
whisper
so
low
that
it
do
not
reach
me
.
<EOS>
for
nearly
five
minute
I
wait
in
impatience
outside
that
close
door
,
until
again
the
handle
turn
and
my
conductress
beckon
me
in
silence
within
.
 
<EOS>
I
step
into
a
small
,
square
chamber
,
the
floor
of
which
be
carpet
,
and
where
,
suspend
high
above
,
be
a
lamp
that
shed
but
<EOS>
a
faint
light
over
the
barely
-
furnish
place
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
sitting
-
room
,
with
a
plain
deal
table
and
a
couple
of
chair
,
but
there
be
no
stove
,
and
the
place
look
chill
and
comfortless
.
<EOS>
beyond
be
another
small
room
into
which
the
old
nun
disappear
for
a
moment
;
then
she
come
forth
lead
a
strange
wan
little
figure
in
a
gray
gown
,
a
figure
whose
face
be
the
most
perfect
and
most
lovely
<EOS>
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Her
wealth
of
chestnut
hair
fall
disheveled
about
her
shoulder
,
and
as
her
hand
be
clasp
before
her
she
look
straight
at
me
in
surprise
as
she
be
lead
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
walk
but
feebly
,
and
her
countenance
be
deathly
pale
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
,
as
she
come
beneath
the
lamp
,
be
,
I
see
,
coarse
,
yet
clean
,
and
her
beautiful
,
regular
feature
,
which
in
her
photograph
have
hold
me
in
such
fascination
,
be
even
more
sweet
and
more
matchless
than
I
have
believe
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
stand
before
her
dumbfound
in
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
in
silence
she
bow
gracefully
,
and
then
look
at
me
with
astonishment
,
apparently
wonder
what
I
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
require
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elma
Heath
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
introduce
myself
to
you
?
<EOS>
My
name
be
Gordon
Gregg
,
English
by
birth
,
cosmopolitan
by
instinct
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
to
ask
you
a
question
--
a
question
that
concern
yourself
.
<EOS>
Lydia
Moreton
have
send
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
her
great
brown
eye
watch
my
lip
and
not
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
Her
own
lip
move
,
but
she
look
at
me
with
an
inexpressible
sadness
.
<EOS>
no
sound
escape
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
rigid
before
her
as
one
turn
to
stone
,
for
in
that
instant
,
in
a
flash
indeed
,
I
realize
the
awful
truth
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
both
deaf
and
dumb
!
 
<EOS>
She
raise
her
clasped
hand
to
me
in
silence
,
yet
with
tear
well
in
her
splendid
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
upon
her
wrist
be
a
pair
of
bright
steel
gyve
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
of
the
woman
in
the
religious
habit
,
when
I
recover
from
the
shock
of
the
poor
girl
's
terrible
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
Castle
of
Kajana
--
the
criminal
lunatic
asylum
of
Finland
,
"
be
her
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
prisoner
,
as
you
see
,
have
lose
both
speech
and
hearing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
deaf
and
dumb
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
look
at
the
beautiful
original
of
that
destroy
photograph
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
"
<EOS>
but
she
have
surely
not
always
be
so
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
think
not
always
,
"
reply
the
sister
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
say
you
intend
to
question
her
,
and
do
I
not
tell
you
that
to
learn
the
truth
be
impossible
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
she
can
write
response
to
my
question
?
<EOS>
"
I
argue
.
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
be
the
old
woman
's
whisper
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
affect
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
unfortunately
,
a
hopeless
lunatic
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
look
straight
into
those
sad
,
wide
-
open
,
yet
unflinche
brown
eye
utterly
confound
.
 
<EOS>
those
white
wrist
hold
in
steel
,
that
pale
face
and
blanch
lip
,
the
inertness
of
her
movement
,
all
tell
their
own
tragic
tale
.
<EOS>
and
yet
that
letter
I
have
read
,
dictate
in
secret
most
probably
because
her
hand
be
not
free
,
be
certainly
not
the
outpouring
of
a
madwoman
.
<EOS>
She
have
speak
of
death
,
it
be
true
,
yet
be
it
not
to
be
suppose
that
she
be
slowly
be
drive
to
suicide
?
<EOS>
She
have
keep
her
secret
,
and
she
wish
the
man
Hornby
--
the
man
who
be
to
marry
Muriel
Leithcourt
--
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
we
stand
be
evidently
an
apartment
set
apart
for
her
use
,
for
beyond
<EOS>
be
the
tiny
bedchamber
;
yet
the
small
,
high
-
up
window
be
closely
bar
,
and
the
cold
bareness
of
the
prison
be
sufficient
indeed
to
cause
anyone
confine
there
to
prefer
death
to
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
again
I
speak
to
her
slowly
and
kindly
,
but
there
be
no
response
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
absolutely
dumb
be
only
too
apparent
.
<EOS>
yet
surely
she
have
not
always
be
so
!
<EOS>
I
have
go
in
search
of
her
because
the
beauty
of
her
portrait
have
magnetize
me
,
and
I
have
now
find
her
to
be
even
more
lovely
than
her
picture
,
yet
,
alas
!
<EOS>
suffer
from
an
affliction
that
render
her
life
a
tragedy
.
<EOS>
the
realization
of
the
terrible
truth
stagger
me
.
<EOS>
such
a
perfect
face
as
her
<EOS>
I
have
never
before
set
eye
upon
,
so
beautiful
,
so
clear
-
cut
,
so
refined
,
so
eminently
the
countenance
of
one
well
-
bear
,
and
yet
so
ineffably
sad
,
so
full
of
blank
unutterable
despair
.
 
<EOS>
She
place
her
clasped
hand
to
her
mouth
and
make
sign
by
shake
her
head
that
she
could
neither
understand
nor
respond
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
take
my
wallet
from
my
pocket
and
write
upon
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
large
hand
the
word
:
"
_
I
come
from
Lydia
Moreton
.
<EOS>
My
name
be
Gordon
Gregg
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
her
eager
gaze
fall
upon
the
word
she
become
instantly
fill
with
excitement
,
and
nod
quickly
.
<EOS>
then
hold
her
steel
-
clasp
wrist
towards
me
she
look
wistfully
at
me
,
as
though
implore
me
to
release
her
from
the
awful
bondage
in
that
silent
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
woman
who
have
lead
me
there
endeavor
to
prevent
it
,
I
hand
her
the
pencil
,
and
place
the
paper
on
the
table
for
her
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
the
nun
try
to
snatch
it
up
,
but
I
hold
her
arm
gently
and
forcibly
,
say
in
French
:
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
if
she
be
really
insane
.
<EOS>
You
will
at
least
allow
me
this
satisfaction
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
while
we
be
in
altercation
,
Elma
,
with
the
pencil
in
her
finger
,
try
to
write
,
but
by
reason
of
her
hand
be
bind
so
closely
be
unable
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
after
several
attempt
,
she
succeed
in
print
in
uneven
capital
the
response
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
on
the
yacht
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
kill
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
thin
-
faced
old
woman
see
her
response
--
a
reply
that
be
surely
rational
enough
--
and
her
brow
contract
with
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
write
,
not
allow
the
sister
to
get
sight
of
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
in
response
,
she
write
painfully
and
laboriously
:
 
"
I
be
condemn
for
a
crime
I
do
not
commit
.
<EOS>
take
me
from
here
,
or
I
shall
kill
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
exclaim
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
poor
girl
,
she
believe
herself
innocent
!
<EOS>
They
all
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
be
she
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
duty
to
inquire
the
history
of
their
crime
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
ill
I
nurse
them
;
that
be
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
the
commandant
of
this
fortress
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Smirnoff
.
<EOS>
if
he
know
that
I
have
admit
you
,
you
would
never
leave
this
place
alive
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
Schusselburg
of
Finland
--
the
place
of
imprisonment
for
those
who
have
conspire
against
the
State
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
prison
of
political
conspirator
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
,
m'sieur
,
yes
!
<EOS>
the
place
in
which
some
of
the
poor
creature
be
torture
in
order
to
obtain
confession
and
information
with
as
much
cruelty
as
in
the
black
day
of
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
these
wall
be
thick
,
and
their
cry
be
not
hear
from
the
oubliette
below
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
long
ago
hear
of
the
horror
of
Schusselburg
.
<EOS>
indeed
who
have
not
hear
of
them
who
have
travel
in
Russia
?
<EOS>
the
very
mention
of
the
modern
Bastille
on
Lake
Ladoga
,
where
no
prisoner
have
ever
be
know
to
come
forth
alive
,
be
sufficient
to
cause
any
Russian
to
turn
pale
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
in
the
Schusselburg
of
Finland
!
 
<EOS>
I
turn
over
the
sheet
of
paper
and
write
the
question--
 
<EOS>
"
do
Baron
Oberg
send
you
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
in
response
,
she
print
the
words--
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
arrest
in
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
tell
Lydia
where
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
Muriel
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
by
the
same
mean
,
whereupon
she
reply
that
they
be
at
school
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
me
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
?
<EOS>
"
I
write
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
warn
you
,
although
I
have
overhear
their
intention
.
<EOS>
They
take
me
ashore
when
you
have
go
,
to
Siena
.
<EOS>
after
three
day
I
find
myself
deaf
and
dumb

I
be
make
so

"
 
<EOS>
Her
allegation
startle
me
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
purposely
afflict
!
 
<EOS>
"
who
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
doctor

I
suppose

<EOS>
They
put
me
under
chloroform

<EOS>
"
who
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
People
who
say
they

<EOS>
I
turn
to
the
woman
in
the
religious
habit

and
cried--
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see

<EOS>
She
have
be
maim
by
some
friend
who
intend
that
the
secret
she
hold
should
be
keep

<EOS>
They
fear
to
kill
her

so
they
bribe
a
doctor
to
deliberately
operate
upon
her
so
that
she
could
neither
speak

hear

and
now
they
be
drive
her
to
suicide

<EOS>
"
M'sieur
,
I
be
astounded

declare
the
nun

<EOS>
"
I
have
always
believe
that

sane

I

cry
in
anger

I
will
make
it
my

discover

punish
the
perpetrator

it

do
not

rashly

seriously

place
her

upon

recollect
<EOS>
you
be
in
Finland
--
where
the
Baron
Oberg
be
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
fear
the
Baron
Oberg
,
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
if
necessary
,
I
will
appeal
to
the
Czar
himself

<EOS>
Mademoiselle
be
keep
here
for
the
reason
that
she
be
in
possession
of
some
secret

<EOS>
She
must
be
release
--
I
will
take
the
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
not
try
to
release
her
from
here
.
<EOS>
It
would
mean
death
to
you
both
.
<EOS>
the
Castle
of
Kajana
tell
no
secret
of
those
who
die
within
its
wall
,
or
of
those
cast
headlong
into
its
water
and
forget
.
"
 
<EOS>
again
I
turn
to
Elma
,
who
stand
in
anxious
wonder
of
the
subject
of
our
conversation
,
and
have
suddenly
take
the
old
nun
's
hand
and
kiss
it
affectionately
,
perhaps
in
order
to
show
me
that
she
trust
her
.
 
<EOS>
then
upon
the
paper
<EOS>
I
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
be
the
Baron
Oberg
your
uncle
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
in
the
negative
,
show
that
the
dread
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
have
only
act
a
part
towards
her
in
which
she
have
be
compel
to
concur

<EOS>
"
who
be
Philip
Hornby

<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
write
rapidly

<EOS>
"
My

"
why
do
he
go
to
Leghorn

<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
for

<EOS>
there

only
I

"
be
the
word
she
print
with
much
labor
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
owe
my

to
you

"
I
write
.
<EOS>
"
and
in

I
will

yourself

"
 
<EOS>
and
to
this
she
replied--
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
thankful
,
for
I
can
not
bear
this
awful
place
longer

<EOS>
I

They

she
write
,
"

<EOS>
"
no

I

<EOS>
I
be

in
Russia

and
go
to
England
when
I
be
a
girl

"
 
<EOS>
that
alter
the
case
entirely
.
<EOS>
as
a
subject
of
the
Czar
in
her
own
country
she
be
amenable
to
that
disgraceful
blot
upon
civilization
that
allow
a
person
to
be
consign
to
prison
at
the
will
of
a
high
official
,
without
trial
or
without
be
afford
any
opportunity
of
appeal
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
at
once
see
a
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
promise
to
tell
me
the
truth
if
I
could
but
secure
her
release
!
 
<EOS>
a
flood
of
recollection
of
the
amazing
mystery
sweep
through
my
mind
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
question
arise
within
me
,
all
of
which
I
desire
to
ask
her
,
but
there
,
in
that
noisome
prison
-
house
,
it
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
as
I
stand
there
a
woman
's
shrill
scream
of
excruciating
pain
reach
me
,
notwithstanding
those
cyclopean
wall
.
<EOS>
some
unfortunate
prisoner
be
,
perhaps
,
be
torture
and
confession
wrung
from
her
lip
.
<EOS>
I
shudder
at
the
unspeakable
horror
of
that
grim
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
allow
this
refined
defenseless
girl
to
remain
an
inmate
of
that
Bastille
,
the
terror
of
which
I
have
hear
man
in
Russia
hint
at
with
bated
breath
?
<EOS>
They
have
willfully
maim
her
and
deprive
her
of
both
hearing
and
the
power
of
speech
,
and
now
they
intend
that
she
should
be
drive
mad
by
that
silence
and
loneliness
that
must
always
end
in
insanity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
decide
,
"
I
say
suddenly
,
turn
to
the
woman
who
have
conduct
me
there
,
and
have
now
remove
the
steel
bond
of
the
prisoner
with
a
key
she
secretly
carry
,
stand
with
folded
hand
in
the
calm
attitude
of
the
religious
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
act
with
rashness
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
implore
in
quick
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
remember
,
your

be
at
stake

as
well

"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
enemy
intend
that
I

too
,
should

"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
look
straight
into
those
deep
mysterious
brown
eye
which
hold
me
as
beneath
a
spell
.
"
<EOS>
They
have
draw
her
into
their
power
because
she
have
no
means
of
defense
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
assume
the
position
of
her
friend
and
protector
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
await
me
in
the
boat
outside
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
take
her
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
m'sieur
,
why
that
be
impossible
!
"
cry
the
old
woman
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
discover
by
the
guard
who
patrol
the
lake
both
night
and
day
they
would
shoot
you
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
risk
it
,
"
I
say
,
and
without
another
word
dash
into
the
tiny
bed
chamber
and
tear
an
old
brown
blanket
from
off
the
narrow
truckle
bed
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
link
my
arm
in
that
of
the
woman
whose
lovely
countenance
have
verily
become
the
sun
of
my
existence
,
I
make
a
sign
,
invite
her
to
accompany
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
sister
bar
the
door
,
urge
me
to
reconsider
my
decision
.
 
<EOS>
"
leave
her
alone
in
secret
,
and
act
as
you
will
,
appeal
to
the
Baron
,
to
the
Czar
,
but
do
not
attempt
,
m'sieur
,
to
rescue
a
prisoner
from
here
,
for
it
be
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
bring
you
here
from
Abo
will
not
dare
to
accept
such
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
to
Elma
,
although
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
could
not
hear
my
voice
.
"
<EOS>
let
us
at
least
make
a
dash
for
freedom
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
recognize
my
intention
in
a
moment
,
and
allow
herself
to
be
conduct
down
the
long
intricate
corridor
,
walk
stealthily
,
and
make
no
noise
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seize
the
old
horn
lantern
,
and
as
the
nun
hold
back
,
not
daring
to
accompany
us
,
we
steal
on
alone
,
turn
back
along
the
stone
corridor
until
I
recognize
the
door
of
the
room
to
which
I
have
be
first
conduct
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
,
and
as
we
creep
along
on
tiptoe
<EOS>
I
feel
the
girl
's
grip
upon
my
arm
,
a
grip
that
tell
me
that
she
place
her
faith
in
me
as
her
deliverer
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
that
it
be
a
rash
and
headstrong
act
,
for
even
beyond
the
lake
<EOS>
how
could
we
ever
hope
to
penetrate
those
interminable
inhospitable
forest
,
so
far
from
any
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
yet
I
feel
it
my
duty
to
attempt
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
have
not
her
marvelous
beauty
enmesh
me
;
have
I
not
feel
by
some
unaccountable
intuition
at
the
first
moment
we
have
meet
that
our
life
be
link
in
the
future
?
<EOS>
She
cling
to
me
as
though
fearful
of
discovery
,
as
we
go
forward
in
silence
along
that
dark
,
low
corridor
where
I
know
the
strong
door
in
the
tower
open
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
once
in
the
boat
,
and
we
could
row
back
to
where
the
horse
await
us
,
and
then
away
.
<EOS>
the
woman
have
not
arrest
our
progress
or
raise
an
alarm
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
once
I
have
mistrust
her
,
but
I
now
see
that
her
heart
be
really
fill
with
pity
for
the
poor
girl
now
at
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
without
a
sound
we
creep
forward
until
within
a
few
yard
from
that
unlocked
door
where
the
boat
await
us
below
,
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
uncertain
light
of
the
lantern
fall
upon
something
that
shone
and
a
deep
voice
cry
out
of
the
darkness
in
Russian--
 
<EOS>
"
halt
!
<EOS>
or
I
fire
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
,
startle
,
we
find
ourselves
look
down
the
muzzle
of
a
loaded
carbine
.
 
<EOS>
a
huge
sentry
stand
with
his
back
to
the
secret
exit
,
his
dark
eye
shine
beneath
his
peaked
cap
,
as
he
hold
his
weapon
to
his
shoulder
within
six
foot
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
big
,
bearded
fellow
demand
fiercely
who
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
sink
within
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
act
recklessly
,
and
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
his
Excellency
,
the
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
,
the
unscrupulous
Governor
-
General
--
fall
into
a
trap
which
,
it
seem
,
have
be
very
cleverly
prepared
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
prisoner
in
the
terrible
fortress
whence
no
single
person
save
the
guard
have
ever
be
know
to
emerge
--
the
Bastille
of
"
the
Strangler
of
Finland
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
the
muzzle
of
the
sentry
's
carbine
be
within
two
foot
of
my
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
speak
!
"
cry
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
at
a
glance
I
take
in
the
peril
of
the
situation
,
and
without
a
second
's
hesitation
make
a
dive
for
the
man
beneath
his
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
lower
it
,
but
it
be
too
late
,
for
I
grip
him
around
the
waist
,
render
his
gun
useless
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
work
of
an
instant
,
for
I
know
that
to
close
with
him
be
my
only
chance
.
 
<EOS>
yet
if
the
boat
be
not
in
wait
below
that
closed
door
?
<EOS>
if
my
Finn
driver
be
not
there
in
readiness
,
then
I
be
lose
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
girl
whom
I
be
there
to
rescue
draw
back
in
fright
against
the
wall
for
a
single
second
,
then
,
see
that
I
have
close
with
the
hulking
fellow
<EOS>
,
she
spring
forward
,
and
with
both
hand
seize
the
gun
and
attempt
to
wrest
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
His
finger
have
lose
the
trigger
,
and
he
be
try
to
regain
it
to
fire
and
so
raise
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
see
this
,
and
with
an
old
trick
learn
at
Uppingham
I
trip
him
,
so
that
he
stagger
and
nearly
fall
.
 
<EOS>
an
oath
escape
him
,
yet
in
that
moment
Elma
succeed
in
twist
the
gun
from
his
sinewy
hand
,
which
I
now
hold
with
a
strength
begotten
of
a
knowledge
of
my
imminent
peril
.
<EOS>
My
whole
future
,
as
well
as
her
,
depend
upon
my
success
in
that
desperate
encounter
.
<EOS>
He
be
huge
and
powerful
,
with
a
strength
far
exceed
my
own
,
yet
I
have
be
reckon
a
good
wrestler
at
Uppingham
,
and
now
my
knowledge
of
that
most
ancient
form
of
combat
hold
me
in
good
stead
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
shout
for
help
,
his
deep
,
hoarse
voice
sound
along
the
stone
corridor
.
<EOS>
if
hear
by
his
comrade
-
in
-
arm
,
then
the
alarm
would
at
once
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
We
struggle
desperately
,
sway
to
and
fro
,
he
try
to
throw
me
,
while
I
,
at
every
turn
,
practice
upon
him
the
trick
learn
in
my
youth
.
<EOS>
It
seem
an
even
match
,
however
,
for
he
keep
his
foot
by
sheer
brute
force
,
and
his
muscle
seem
hard
and
unbending
as
steel
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
however
,
as
we
be
strive
so
vigorously
and
desperately
,
the
English
girl
slip
past
us
with
the
carbine
in
her
hand
,
and
with
a
quick
movement
drag
open
the
heavy
door
that
give
exit
to
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
I
unfortunately
make
a
false
move
,
and
his
hand
close
upon
my
throat
like
a
band
of
steel
.
<EOS>
I
fight
and
struggle
to
loose
myself
,
exert
every
muscle
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
he
gain
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
hear
a
splash
,
and
see
that
Elma
no
longer
hold
the
sentry
's
weapon
in
her
hand
,
have
throw
it
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
then
at
the
same
moment
I
hear
a
voice
outside
cry
in
a
low
tone
:
"
courage
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
courage
!
<EOS>
I
will
come
and
help
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
faithful
Finn
,
who
have
be
await
me
in
the
deep
shadow
,
and
with
a
few
stroke
pull
his
boat
up
to
the
narrow
rickety
ledge
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
the
lady
!
"
<EOS>
I
succeed
in
gasping
in
Russian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
never
mind
me
,
"
and
I
see
to
my
satisfaction
that
he
guide
Elma
to
step
into
the
boat
,
which
at
that
moment
drift
past
the
little
platform
.
 
<EOS>
I
struggle
valiantly
,
but
against
such
a
man
of
brute
strength
I
be
powerless
.
<EOS>
He
hold
my
throat
,
cause
me
excruciating
pain
,
and
each
moment
I
feel
my
chance
of
victory
grow
small
.
<EOS>
My
strength
be
fail
.
<EOS>
while
I
hold
his
arm
at
his
side
,
I
could
keep
him
secure
without
much
effort
,
but
now
with
his
finger
press
in
my
windpipe
I
could
not
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
slowly
be
strangle
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
vanquish
mean
imprisonment
there
,
perhaps
even
death
.
<EOS>
victory
mean
Elma
's
life
,
as
well
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
Mine
be
therefore
a
fight
for
life
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
idea
flash
across
my
mind
,
and
I
continue
to
struggle
,
at
the
same
time
gradually
force
my
enemy
backward
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
shout
for
help
,
but
be
unheard
.
<EOS>
He
curse
and
swear
and
shout
until
,
<EOS>
with
a
sudden
and
almost
superhuman
effort
,
I
trip
him
,
bring
his
head
into
such
violent
contact
with
the
stone
lintel
of
the
door
that
the
sound
could
surely
be
hear
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
he
be
stunned
,
and
in
that
brief
second
I
release
his
grip
from
my
throat
and
hurl
him
backwards
beyond
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
sound
of
the
crashing
of
wood
as
the
rotten
platform
give
way
,
a
loud
splash
,
and
next
instant
<EOS>
the
dark
water
close
over
the
big
,
bearded
fellow
who
would
have
snatch
Elma
Heath
from
me
,
and
have
hold
me
prisoner
in
that
castle
of
terror
.
<EOS>
He
sink
like
a
stone
,
for
although
I
stand
watch
for
him
to
rise
,
I
could
only
distinguish
the
woodwork
float
away
with
the
current
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
,
however
,
even
as
I
stand
there
in
horror
at
my
deed
of
self
-
defense
,
the
place
suddenly
resound
with
shout
of
alarm
,
and
in
the
tower
above
me
the
great
old
rusty
bell
begin
to
swing
,
ring
its
brazen
note
across
the
broad
expanse
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
the
fair
-
bearded
Finn
again
shoot
the
boat
across
to
where
I
stand
,
crying--
 
<EOS>
"
jump
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
for
your
life
,
jump
!
<EOS>
the
guard
will
be
upon
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
behind
me
in
the
passage
<EOS>
I
see
a
light
and
the
glitter
of
arm
.
<EOS>
a
shot
ring
out
,
and
a
bullet
whiz
past
me
,
but
I
stand
unharmed
.
<EOS>
then
I
jump
,
and
nearly
upset
the
boat
,
but
take
an
oar
I
begin
to
row
for
life
,
and
as
we
draw
away
from
those
grim
,
black
wall
the
fire
belch
forth
from
three
rifle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Row
!
<EOS>
"
I
shriek
,
turn
to
see
if
my
fair
companion
have
be
hit
.
 
<EOS>
"
keep
cool
,
Excellency
,
"
urge
the
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
see
,
right
away
there
in
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
We
may
trick
them
,
for
the
patrol
-
boat
will
be
at
the
head
of
the
river
wait
to
cut
us
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
again
the
guard
fire
upon
us
,
but
in
the
darkness
their
aim
be
faulty
.
<EOS>
light
appear
in
the
high
window
of
the
castle
,
and
we
could
see
that
the
great
commotion
have
be
cause
by
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
the
man
at
the
door
in
the
tower
be
shout
to
the
patrol
-
boat
,
which
be
nowhere
to
be
see
,
call
them
to
row
us
down
and
capture
us
,
but
by
ply
our
oar
rapidly
we
shoot
straight
across
the
lake
until
we
get
under
the
deep
shadow
of
the
opposite
shore
,
and
then
creep
gradually
along
in
the
direction
we
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
we
meet
the
boat
,
Excellency
,
we
must
run
ashore
and
take
to
the
wood
,
"
explain
the
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
our
only
chance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
have
he
speak
when
out
in
the
center
of
the
lake
we
could
just
distinguish
a
long
boat
with
three
rower
go
swiftly
towards
the
entrance
to
the
river
,
which
we
so
desire
to
gain
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
!
"
<EOS>
cry
our
guide
,
back
water
,
and
bring
the
boat
to
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
in
search
of
us
!
<EOS>
if
we
be
discover
they
will
fire
.
<EOS>
It
be
their
order
.
<EOS>
no
boat
be
allow
upon
this
lake
.
"
 
<EOS>
Elma
sit
watch
our
pursuer
,
but
still
calm
and
silent
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
intrust
herself
entirely
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
guard
be
row
rapidly
,
the
oar
sound
in
the
rowlock
,
evidently
in
the
belief
that
we
have
make
for
the
river
.
<EOS>
but
the
Finlander
have
apparently
foresee
this
,
and
for
that
reason
we
be
lie
safe
from
observation
in
the
deep
shadow
of
an
overhang
tree
.
 
<EOS>
a
gray
mist
be
slowly
rise
from
the
water
,
and
the
Finn
,
notice
it
<EOS>
,
hope
that
it
may
favor
us
.
<EOS>
in
Finland
in
late
autumn
the
mist
be
often
as
thick
as
our
proverbial
London
fog
,
only
whiter
,
denser
,
and
more
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
we
disembark
we
shall
be
compel
to
make
a
detour
of
fully
four
day
in
the
forest
,
in
order
to
pass
the
marsh
,
"
he
point
out
in
a
low
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
but
if
we
can
enter
the
river
we
can
go
ashore
anywhere
and
get
by
foot
to
some
place
where
the
lady
can
lie
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
advise
?
<EOS>
We
be
entirely
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
the
Chief
of
Police
tell
me
he
could
trust
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
be
good
to
risk
it
,
"
he
say
in
Russian
after
a
brief
pause
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
tie
up
the
boat
,
and
I
will
go
along
the
bank
and
see
what
the
guard
be
do
.
<EOS>
You
will
remain
here
,
and
I
shall
not
be
see
.
<EOS>
the
rush
and
undergrowth
be
high
further
along
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
danger
while
I
be
absent
get
out
and
go
straight
westward
until
you
find
the
marsh
,
then
keep
along
its
bank
due
south
,
"
and
draw
up
the
boat
to
the
bank
the
shrewd
,
big
-
bone
fellow
disappear
into
the
dark
undergrowth
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
yet
of
the
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
star
be
now
hide
,
and
the
great
plane
of
water
be
every
moment
grow
more
indistinct
as
we
both
sit
in
silence
.
<EOS>
My
ear
be
strain
to
catch
the
dipping
of
an
oar
or
a
voice
,
but
beyond
the
lapping
of
the
water
beneath
the
boat
there
be
no
other
sound
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
hand
of
the
fair
-
faced
girl
at
my
side
and
press
it
.
<EOS>
in
return
she
press
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
mean
by
which
we
could
exchange
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
whom
I
have
seek
through
all
those
month
sit
at
my
side
,
yet
powerless
to
utter
one
single
word
.
 
<EOS>
still
hold
her
hand
in
both
my
own
I
grip
them
to
show
her
that
I
intend
to
be
her
champion
,
while
she
turn
to
me
in
confidence
as
though
happy
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
be
her
history
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
mystery
surround
her
?
<EOS>
what
could
be
that
secret
which
have
cause
her
enemy
to
thus
brutally
maim
and
mutilate
her
,
and
afterwards
send
her
to
that
grim
,
terrible
fortress
that
still
loom
up
before
us
in
the
gloom
?
<EOS>
surely
her
secret
must
affect
some
person
very
seriously
,
or
such
drastic
mean
would
never
be
employ
to
secure
her
silence
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
I
hear
a
stealthy
footstep
approaching
,
and
next
moment
a
low
voice
speak
which
I
recognize
as
that
of
our
friend
,
the
Finn
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
danger
,
Excellency
--
a
grave
danger
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
a
low
half
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
three
boat
be
in
search
of
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
scarcely
have
he
utter
those
word
when
there
be
the
flash
of
a
rifle
from
the
haze
,
a
loud
report
,
and
again
a
bullet
whiz
past
just
behind
my
head
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
the
truth
become
apparent
,
for
I
see
the
dark
shadow
of
a
boat
rapidly
row
,
bear
full
upon
us
.
<EOS>
the
shot
have
be
fire
as
a
signal
that
we
have
be
sight
,
and
be
pursue
.
<EOS>
other
shot
ring
out
,
mingle
with
the
wild
exultant
shout
of
the
guard
as
they
bear
down
full
upon
us
,
and
then
I
know
that
,
notwithstanding
our
escape
,
we
be
now
lose
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
close
upon
us
to
admit
of
elude
them
.
<EOS>
the
peril
we
have
dread
have
fall
.
<EOS>
the
Finn
's
presence
on
the
bank
have
evidently
be
detect
by
a
boat
draw
up
at
the
shore
,
and
he
have
be
follow
to
where
we
have
lain
in
what
we
have
so
foolishly
believe
to
be
a
safe
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
Nought
else
be
to
be
do
but
to
face
the
inevitable
.
<EOS>
three
time
the
red
fire
of
a
rifle
belch
angrily
in
our
face
,
and
yet
,
by
good
fortune
,
neither
of
us
be
strike
.
<EOS>
yet
we
know
too
well
that
the
intention
of
our
pursuer
be
to
kill
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quick
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
fly
!
<EOS>
while
there
be
yet
time
!
"
<EOS>
gasp
the
Finn
,
grasp
my
hand
and
half
drag
me
from
the
boat
,
while
,
I
,
in
turn
,
place
Elma
upon
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Hoida
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
way
!
<EOS>
swiftly
!
"
cry
our
guide
,
and
the
three
of
us
,
heedless
of
the
consequence
,
plunge
forward
into
the
impenetrable
darkness
,
just
as
our
fierce
pursuer
come
alongside
where
we
have
only
a
moment
ago
be
seat
.
<EOS>
They
shout
wildly
as
they
spring
to
land
after
us
,
but
our
guide
,
who
have
be
bear
and
breed
in
these
forest
,
know
well
how
to
travel
in
a
semi
-
circle
,
and
how
to
conceal
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
race
for
freedom
--
nay
,
for
very
life
.
 
<EOS>
so
dark
that
we
could
see
before
us
hardly
a
foot
,
we
be
compel
to
place
our
hand
in
front
of
us
to
avoid
collision
with
the
big
tree
trunk
,
while
ever
and
anon
<EOS>
we
find
ourselves
entangle
in
the
mass
of
dead
creeper
and
vegetable
parasite
that
form
the
dense
undergrowth
.
<EOS>
around
us
on
every
side
we
hear
the
shout
and
curse
of
our
pursuer
,
while
above
the
rest
we
hear
an
authoritative
voice
,
evidently
that
of
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
,
cry--
 
<EOS>
"
shoot
the
man
,
but
spare
the
woman
!
<EOS>
the
Colonel
want
her
back
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
her
escape
!
<EOS>
We
shall
be
well
reward
.
<EOS>
so
keep
on
,
comrade
!
<EOS>
_
Mene
edemmaeski
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
tremble
girl
beside
me
hear
nothing
,
and
perhaps
indeed
it
be
good
that
she
could
not
hear
.
<EOS>
My
only
fear
be
that
our
pursuer
,
of
whom
there
now
seem
to
be
a
dozen
,
have
extend
,
with
the
intention
of
encircle
us
.
<EOS>
They
,
no
doubt
,
know
every
inch
of
that
giant
forest
with
its
numerous
bog
and
marsh
,
and
if
they
could
not
discover
us
would
no
doubt
drive
us
into
one
or
other
of
the
bog
,
where
escape
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Our
gallant
guide
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seem
to
utterly
disregard
the
danger
and
keep
on
,
every
now
and
then
stretch
out
his
hand
and
help
along
the
afflict
girl
we
have
rescue
from
that
living
tomb
.
<EOS>
Headlong
we
go
in
a
straight
line
,
until
suddenly
we
begin
to
feel
our
foot
sink
into
the
soft
ground
,
and
then
the
Finlander
turn
to
the
left
,
at
right
angle
,
and
we
find
ourselves
in
a
denser
undergrowth
,
where
in
the
darkness
our
hand
and
face
become
badly
scratch
.
 
<EOS>
another
gun
be
fire
as
signal
,
echo
through
the
wood
,
but
the
sound
come
from
the
opposite
direction
to
that
we
be
travel
;
therefore
we
hope
that
we
have
elude
those
whose
earnest
desire
it
be
to
capture
us
for
the
reward
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
however
,
a
second
gun
,
an
answering
signal
,
be
fire
from
straight
before
us
,
and
that
reveal
the
truth
.
<EOS>
We
be
actually
between
the
two
party
,
and
they
be
close
in
upon
us
!
<EOS>
They
have
already
drive
us
to
the
edge
of
the
bog
.
<EOS>
the
Finlander
recognize
our
peril
as
quickly
as
I
do
,
and
halt
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
turn
straight
back
,
"
he
urge
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
yet
elude
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
again
turn
off
at
right
angle
,
travel
as
quickly
as
we
be
able
back
towards
the
lake
shore
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
exciting
chase
in
the
darkness
,
for
we
know
not
whither
we
be
go
,
nor
into
what
pitfall
or
ravine
or
treacherous
marsh
we
may
fall
.
<EOS>
once
we
see
afar
through
the
tree
the
light
of
a
lantern
hold
by
a
guard
,
and
already
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
beside
me
seem
tired
and
terribly
fatigued
.
<EOS>
but
we
hurry
on
and
on
,
strive
to
make
no
noise
,
and
yet
the
crackling
of
wood
beneath
our
foot
seem
to
us
to
sound
like
the
noise
of
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
breathless
,
we
halt
to
listen
.
<EOS>
We
be
already
in
sight
of
the
gray
mist
where
lie
the
silent
lake
that
hold
so
many
secret
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
sound
.
<EOS>
the
guard
have
go
straight
on
,
believe
they
have
drive
us
into
that
deadly
bog
wherein
,
if
we
have
enter
,
we
must
have
be
slowly
suck
down
and
engulf
.
<EOS>
They
be
surround
it
,
no
doubt
,
feel
certain
of
their
prey
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
creep
along
the
water
's
edge
,
until
in
the
gray
light
we
could
distinguish
two
empty
boat
--
that
of
the
guard
and
our
own
.
<EOS>
We
be
again
at
the
spot
where
we
have
disembark
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
row
to
the
head
of
the
lake
,
"
suggest
the
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
then
land
and
escape
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
a
moment
later
we
be
all
three
in
the
guard
'
boat
,
row
with
all
our
might
under
the
deep
shadow
of
the
bank
northward
,
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
town
of
Nystad
.
 
<EOS>
We
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
for
any
other
boat
,
but
see
none
.
<EOS>
the
signal
ashore
have
attract
all
the
guard
to
that
spot
to
join
in
the
search
,
and
now
,
have
double
back
and
again
embark
,
we
be
every
moment
increase
the
distance
between
ourselves
and
our
pursuer
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
must
have
row
several
mile
,
for
ere
we
land
again
,
upon
a
low
,
flat
and
barren
shore
,
the
first
gray
streak
of
day
be
show
in
the
east
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
notice
it
,
and
keep
her
great
brown
eye
fix
upon
it
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
dawn
for
her
--
the
dawn
of
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
Our
eye
meet
;
she
smile
at
me
,
and
then
gaze
again
eastward
,
full
of
silent
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
have
land
,
we
draw
the
boat
up
and
conceal
it
in
the
undergrowth
so
that
the
guard
,
on
search
,
should
not
know
the
direction
we
have
take
,
and
then
we
go
straight
on
northward
across
the
low
-
lying
land
,
to
where
the
forest
show
dark
against
the
morning
gray
.
<EOS>
the
mist
have
now
somewhat
clear
,
but
the
air
be
keen
and
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
this
wood
,
we
find
,
be
of
tall
high
pine
,
where
walk
be
not
difficult
,
a
wide
wilderness
of
tree
which
,
hour
after
hour
,
we
traverse
in
the
vain
endeavor
to
find
the
rough
path
which
our
guide
tell
us
lead
for
a
hundred
mile
from
Alavo
down
to
tammerfor
,
the
manufacturing
center
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
but
to
discover
a
path
in
a
forest
forty
mile
wide
be
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
,
and
for
hour
we
wander
on
and
on
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
always
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
faint
and
hungry
,
yet
we
still
keep
courage
.
<EOS>
fortunately
we
find
a
little
spring
,
and
all
three
of
us
drink
eagerly
with
our
hand
.
<EOS>
but
of
food
we
have
nothing
,
save
a
small
piece
of
hard
rye
bread
which
the
Finn
have
in
his
pocket
,
the
remain
of
his
evening
meal
;
and
this
we
give
to
Elma
,
who
,
half
famished
,
eat
it
quickly
.
<EOS>
We
know
quite
well
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
die
of
starvation
in
that
great
trackless
forest
,
therefore
we
keep
on
undaunted
,
while
the
yellow
autumn
sun
struggle
through
the
dark
pine
,
glint
on
the
straight
gray
trunk
and
reflect
a
golden
light
in
that
dead
unbroken
silence
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
mile
we
trudge
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
consolation
to
know
that
we
now
have
no
pursuer
,
yet
what
fate
lie
before
us
<EOS>
we
know
not
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
only
find
that
forest
-
road
we
may
come
across
some
wood
-
cutter
's
hut
,
where
we
could
obtain
rough
food
of
some
sort
,
yet
our
guide
,
use
as
he
be
to
those
enormous
wood
of
central
Finland
,
be
utterly
out
of
his
bearing
,
and
no
mark
of
civilization
attract
his
quick
,
experienced
eye
.
<EOS>
the
light
above
gradually
fade
,
and
over
a
sharp
stone
Elma
stumble
and
rip
her
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
watch
,
and
find
that
it
be
already
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
in
an
hour
it
would
be
dark
,
the
beginning
of
the
long
northern
night
.
<EOS>
Elma
,
who
be
weary
and
footsore
,
ask
by
sign
to
be
permit
to
lay
down
and
rest
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
gather
a
bed
of
dry
leave
for
her
,
and
she
lie
down
,
and
while
we
watch
she
be
soon
asleep
.
<EOS>
the
Finn
,
who
declare
that
he
do
not
suffer
from
the
cold
,
remove
his
coat
and
place
it
tenderly
upon
her
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
while
there
be
still
a
ray
of
light
I
watch
her
white
refined
feature
as
she
sleep
,
and
be
sorely
tempt
to
bend
and
imprint
a
kiss
upon
that
soft
invite
cheek
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
no
right
to
do
so
--
no
right
to
take
such
an
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
cold
night
pass
wearily
,
and
the
howling
of
the
wolf
cause
me
to
grip
my
revolver
,
yet
at
daybreak
we
arise
refresh
,
and
notwithstanding
the
terrible
pang
of
hunger
now
gnaw
at
our
vital
,
we
be
prepared
to
renew
our
desperate
dash
for
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
have
paper
,
I
possess
no
pencil
with
which
to
write
,
therefore
I
could
only
communicate
by
sign
with
the
mysterious
prisoner
of
Kajana
,
the
beautiful
dark
-
eyed
girl
who
hold
me
irrevocably
beneath
the
spell
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
all
the
little
act
of
homage
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
perform
she
accept
with
a
quiet
,
calm
dignity
,
while
in
her
deep
luminous
eye
I
read
an
unfathomable
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
the
mist
have
not
clear
,
for
it
be
soon
after
dawn
when
we
again
move
along
,
hungry
,
chill
,
and
yet
hopeful
.
<EOS>
at
a
spring
we
obtain
some
water
,
and
then
,
in
silent
procession
,
press
forward
in
search
of
the
rough
track
of
the
woodcutter
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
's
tear
shoe
give
her
considerable
trouble
,
and
notice
her
limping
,
I
induce
her
to
sit
down
while
I
take
it
off
,
hope
to
be
able
to
mend
it
,
but
,
have
unlace
it
,
I
see
that
upon
her
stocking
be
a
large
patch
of
congealed
blood
,
where
her
foot
itself
have
also
be
cut
.
<EOS>
I
manage
to
beat
the
nail
of
the
shoe
with
a
stone
,
so
that
its
sole
should
not
be
lose
,
and
she
readjust
it
,
allow
me
to
lace
it
up
for
her
and
smile
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
forward
we
trudge
,
ever
forward
,
across
that
enormous
forest
where
the
myriad
treetrunk
present
the
same
dismal
scene
everywhere
,
a
forest
untrodden
save
by
wild
,
half
-
savage
lumberman
.
<EOS>
throughout
that
dull
gray
day
we
march
onward
,
faint
with
hunger
,
yet
suffer
but
little
pain
,
for
the
first
pang
be
now
past
,
and
be
succeed
by
slight
light
-
headedness
.
<EOS>
My
only
fear
be
that
we
should
be
compel
to
spend
another
night
without
shelter
,
and
what
its
effect
may
be
upon
the
delicately
-
rear
girl
whose
hand
I
hold
tenderly
in
mine
.
<EOS>
surely
my
position
be
a
strange
one
.
<EOS>
Her
terrible
affliction
seem
to
cause
her
to
be
entirely
dependent
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
just
as
the
yellow
sunlight
overhead
have
begin
to
fade
,
the
flat
-
faced
Finn
,
whose
name
he
have
tell
me
be
Felix
Estlander
,
cry
joyfully--
 
<EOS>
"
_
Polushaite
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Look
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
the
road
at
last
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
we
glance
before
us
we
see
that
his
quick
,
well
-
train
eye
have
detect
away
in
the
twilight
,
at
some
distance
,
a
path
traverse
our
vista
among
the
gray
-
green
tree
-
trunk
.
<EOS>
then
,
hurry
along
,
we
find
ourselves
upon
a
track
,
on
which
we
turn
to
the
right
--
a
track
,
rough
and
deeply
-
rut
by
the
fell
trunk
that
be
drag
along
it
to
the
near
river
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
make
a
gesture
of
renew
hope
,
and
all
three
of
us
redouble
our
pace
,
expect
every
moment
to
come
upon
some
log
hut
,
the
owner
of
which
would
surely
give
us
hospitality
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
but
darkness
come
on
quickly
,
and
yet
we
still
push
forward
.
<EOS>
poor
Elma
be
limp
,
and
I
know
that
her
injured
foot
be
pain
her
,
even
though
she
could
tell
me
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
after
walk
for
nearly
four
hour
in
the
almost
impenetrable
forest
gloom
,
always
fear
lest
we
may
miss
the
path
,
our
heart
suddenly
beat
quickly
by
see
before
us
a
light
shine
in
a
window
,
and
five
minute
later
Felix
be
knock
at
the
door
,
and
ask
in
Finnish
the
occupant
to
give
hospitality
to
a
lady
lose
in
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
a
low
growl
like
a
muttered
imprecation
within
,
and
when
the
door
open
there
stand
upon
the
threshold
a
tall
,
bearded
,
muscular
old
fellow
in
a
dirty
red
shirt
,
with
a
big
revolver
shine
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
a
quick
glance
at
us
satisfy
him
that
we
be
not
thief
,
and
he
invite
us
in
while
Felix
explain
that
we
have
land
from
the
lake
,
and
our
boat
have
drift
away
<EOS>
we
have
be
compel
to
take
to
the
wood
.
<EOS>
the
man
hear
the
Finn
's
picturesque
story
,
and
then
say
something
to
me
which
Felix
translate
into
Russian
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Excellency
be
welcome
to
all
the
poor
fare
he
have
.
<EOS>
He
give
up
his
bed
in
the
room
yonder
to
the
lady
,
so
that
she
may
rest
.
<EOS>
He
be
honor
by
your
Excellency
's
presence
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
while
he
be
make
this
explanation
the
herculean
wood
-
cutter
in
the
red
shirt
stir
the
red
ember
whereon
a
big
pot
be
simmer
,
and
send
forth
an
appetize
odor
,
and
in
five
minute
we
be
all
three
sit
down
to
a
stew
of
capercailzie
,
with
a
foaming
light
beer
as
a
fitting
beverage
.
<EOS>
We
finish
the
dish
with
such
lightning
rapidity
that
our
host
boil
us
a
number
of
egg
,
which
,
I
fear
,
denude
his
larder
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
be
a
poor
one
of
two
low
room
,
build
of
rough
log
-
pine
,
with
double
window
for
the
winter
and
a
high
brick
stove
.
<EOS>
Cleanliness
be
not
exactly
its
characteristic
,
nevertheless
we
all
pass
a
very
comfortable
hour
,
and
receive
a
warm
welcome
from
the
lonely
old
fellow
who
pass
his
life
so
far
beyond
european
civilization
,
and
whose
house
,
he
tell
us
,
be
often
snow
up
and
cut
off
from
all
the
world
for
three
or
four
month
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
finish
our
meal
,
I
ask
the
sturdy
old
fellow
for
a
pencil
,
but
the
near
thing
he
possess
be
a
stick
of
thick
charcoal
,
and
with
that
it
be
surely
difficult
to
communicate
with
our
fair
companion
.
<EOS>
therefore
she
rise
,
give
me
her
hand
,
bow
smilingly
,
and
then
pass
into
the
inner
room
and
close
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
wood
-
cutter
give
us
some
coarse
tobacco
,
and
after
smoke
and
chat
for
an
hour
we
throw
ourselves
wearily
upon
the
wooden
bench
and
sleep
soundly
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
however
,
at
early
dawn
,
we
be
startle
by
a
loud
banging
at
the
door
,
the
clattering
of
hoofs
,
and
authoritative
shout
in
Russian
.
<EOS>
the
old
wood
-
cutter
spring
up
,
and
look
through
a
chink
in
the
heavy
shutter
turn
to
us
with
blanched
face
,
whisper
breathlessly--
 
<EOS>
"
the
police
!
<EOS>
what
can
they
want
of
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
open
!
"
shout
the
horseman
outside
.
<EOS>
"
open
in
the
name
of
his
Majesty
!
"
 
<EOS>
Felix
<EOS>
and
I
spring
up
face
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
entrap
!
"
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
our
guide
Felix
make
a
dash
for
the
door
of
the
inner
room
where
Elma
have
retire
,
but
next
second
he
reappear
,
gasp
in
Russian--
 
"
Excellency
!
<EOS>
why
,
the
door
be
open
!
<EOS>
the
lady
have
go
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
go
!
"
<EOS>
I
cry
,
dismay
,
rush
into
the
little
room
,
where
I
find
the
truckle
couch
empty
,
and
the
door
lead
outside
wide
open
.
<EOS>
She
have
actually
disappear
!
 
<EOS>
the
police
again
batter
at
the
opposite
door
,
threaten
loudly
to
break
it
in
if
it
be
not
open
at
once
,
whereupon
the
old
wood
-
cutter
draw
the
bolt
and
admit
them
.
<EOS>
two
big
,
hulking
fellow
in
heavy
riding
-
coat
and
sword
strode
in
,
while
two
other
remain
mount
outside
,
hold
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
name
?
"
demand
one
of
the
fellow
,
glance
at
us
as
we
stand
together
in
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
Our
host
tell
them
his
name
,
and
ask
why
they
wish
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
search
for
a
woman
who
have
escape
from
Kajana
,
"
be
the
reply
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
see
any
woman
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
respond
the
wood
-
cutter
.
<EOS>
"
We
never
see
any
woman
out
in
these
wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
police
-
officer
strode
into
the
inner
room
,
glance
around
to
make
certain
that
no
one
be
conceal
there
,
and
then
return
to
me
ask
,
"
who
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
own
affair
,
"
I
answer
.
 
<EOS>
the
mystery
of
Elma
's
disappearance
while
we
have
sleep
annoy
me
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
have
flee
from
me
in
secret
.
<EOS>
yet
could
she
have
receive
some
warning
that
the
police
be
in
search
of
her
?
<EOS>
She
be
deaf
,
therefore
she
could
not
have
be
alarm
by
the
banging
on
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
identity
be
my
affair
,
"
declare
<EOS>
the
man
with
the
fair
,
bristly
beard
,
an
average
type
of
the
uncouth
officer
of
police
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
your
chief
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
as
a
sudden
thought
occur
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Melnikoff
,
at
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
this
be
not
in
the
district
of
Abo
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
but
what
difference
do
it
make
?
<EOS>
who
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gordon
Gregg
,
british
subject
,
"
<EOS>
I
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
the
drosky
-
driver
from
Abo
,
"
remark
the
fellow
,
turn
to
Felix
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
pair
who
bribe
the
nun
at
Kajana
,
and
succeed
in
release
the
Englishwoman
.
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
the
Czar
,
I
arrest
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
old
wood
-
cutter
turn
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
We
certainly
be
in
grave
peril
,
for
I
foresaw
the
danger
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
Baron
Oberg
,
the
Strangler
of
Finland
.
<EOS>
yet
we
have
a
satisfaction
in
know
that
,
be
the
mystery
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
Elma
have
escape
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
on
what
charge
,
pray
,
do
you
presume
to
arrest
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
as
coolly
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
aid
a
prisoner
to
escape
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
wish
to
say
,
first
,
that
you
have
no
power
to
arrest
me
;
and
,
secondly
,
that
if
you
wish
me
to
give
you
satisfaction
,
I
be
perfectly
willing
to
do
so
,
provide
you
first
accompany
me
down
to
Abo
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
outside
my
district
,
"
growl
the
fellow
,
but
I
see
that
his
hesitancy
be
due
to
his
uncertainty
as
to
whom
I
really
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
to
take
me
to
the
Chief
of
Police
Boranski
,
who
will
make
all
the
explanation
necessary
.
<EOS>
until
we
have
an
interview
with
him
,
I
refuse
to
give
any
information
concern
myself
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
a
passport
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
draw
it
from
my
pocket
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
It
prove
,
I
think
,
that
my
name
be
what
I
have
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
stand
astride
,
read
it
,
and
hand
it
back
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
woman
?
"
<EOS>
he
demand
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
be
my
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
the
old
wood
-
cutter
with
a
sinister
expression
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
remember
,
these
fugitive
be
find
in
your
house
,
and
you
be
liable
to
arrest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
--
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
!
"
protest
the
old
fellow
,
tremble
beneath
the
officer
's
threat
.
<EOS>
like
all
his
class
,
he
fear
the
police
,
and
hold
them
in
dread
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
do
not
remember
,
I
suppose
!
<EOS>
"
he
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
your
memory
will
be
refresh
by
a
month
or
two
in
prison
.
<EOS>
You
be
also
arrest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
your
Excellency
,
I--
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
blare
the
bristly
officer
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
give
shelter
to
conspirator
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
penalty
in
Finland
for
that
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
these
gentleman
be
surely
not
conspirator
!
"
<EOS>
the
poor
old
man
protest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
Excellency
be
English
,
and
the
English
do
not
plot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
afterwards
,
"
he
laugh
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
turn
to
the
agent
of
police
at
his
side
,
he
give
him
order
to
search
the
log
-
hut
carefully
,
an
investigation
in
which
one
of
the
man
from
the
outside
join
.
<EOS>
They
upset
everything
and
pry
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
find
paper
or
letter
,
"
say
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
search
thoroughly
.
"
<EOS>
and
in
every
corner
they
rummage
,
even
to
take
up
a
number
of
board
in
the
inner
room
which
Elma
have
occupy
.
<EOS>
but
they
find
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
a
dozen
time
be
the
old
wood
-
cutter
question
,
but
he
stubbornly
refuse
to
admit
that
he
have
ever
set
eye
upon
Elma
,
while
I
insist
on
my
right
to
return
to
Abo
and
see
Boranski
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
of
course
,
by
what
we
have
overhear
say
by
the
prison
-
guard
,
that
the
Governor
-
General
be
extremely
anxious
to
recapture
the
girl
with
whom
,
I
frankly
admit
,
I
have
now
so
utterly
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
and
it
appear
that
no
effort
be
be
spare
to
search
for
us
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
whole
of
the
police
in
the
province
of
Abo
and
of
Helsingfors
seem
to
be
actively
make
a
house
-
to
-
house
search
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
could
be
the
truth
of
Elma
's
disappearance
?
<EOS>
have
she
flee
of
her
own
accord
,
or
have
she
once
more
fallen
a
victim
to
some
ingenious
and
dastardly
plot
.
<EOS>
that
gray
dress
of
her
may
,
I
recollect
,
betray
her
if
she
dare
to
venture
near
any
town
,
while
her
affliction
would
,
of
itself
,
be
plain
evidence
of
identification
.
<EOS>
all
I
hope
be
that
she
have
go
and
hide
herself
in
the
forest
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
to
wait
until
the
danger
of
recapture
have
pass
.
 
<EOS>
for
nearly
half
an
hour
I
argue
with
the
police
officer
whose
intention
it
be
to
take
me
under
arrest
to
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
once
there
,
however
,
I
know
too
well
that
my
liberty
would
be
probably
go
for
ever
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
the
Baron
's
motive
in
hold
the
poor
girl
a
prisoner
,
it
would
also
be
his
motive
to
silence
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
too
much
for
his
liking
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
refuse
to
go
to
Helsingfors
,
"
I
say
defiantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
british
subject
,
and
demand
to
be
take
back
to
the
port
where
my
passport
be
vise
.
<EOS>
"
this
argument
I
repeat
time
after
time
,
until
at
length
I
succeed
in
convince
him
that
I
really
have
a
right
to
be
take
to
Abo
,
and
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
British
Vice
-
Consul
if
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
for
as
long
as
possible
I
succeed
in
delay
our
departure
,
but
at
length
,
just
as
the
yellow
sun
begin
to
struggle
through
the
gray
cloud
,
we
be
all
three
compel
to
depart
in
sorrowful
procession
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
we
wonder
,
have
really
happen
to
Elma
?
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
she
have
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
police
;
nevertheless
,
the
fact
that
the
door
of
the
inner
room
be
open
cause
them
to
look
upon
the
statement
of
the
wood
-
cutter
with
distinct
suspicion
and
disbelief
.
 
<EOS>
Our
captor
seem
quite
well
aware
of
all
the
circumstance
of
our
escape
from
Kajana
,
and
be
consequently
fill
with
chagrin
that
Elma
,
the
person
they
so
much
desire
to
recapture
,
have
slip
through
their
finger
.
<EOS>
while
the
police
ride
,
we
be
compel
to
walk
before
them
,
and
after
trudge
ten
mile
or
so
through
the
forest
we
come
across
another
small
posse
of
police
,
who
be
apparently
in
search
of
us
,
for
they
express
delight
when
they
see
us
under
arrest
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
woman
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
one
officer
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
still
at
liberty
,
"
reply
the
man
who
hold
us
as
prisoner
.
"
<EOS>
in
hide
twenty
verst
back
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
we
shall
find
her
before
long
,
"
he
say
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
within
twelve
hour
we
shall
have
search
the
whole
forest
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
escape
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Our
captor
explain
who
we
be
,
and
then
we
be
push
forward
again
,
skirt
a
great
wide
lake
call
the
Nasjarvi
,
along
the
woode
shore
of
which
we
walk
the
whole
day
long
until
,
at
sundown
,
we
come
to
a
picturesque
little
log
-
build
town
face
the
water
,
call
Filppula
.
<EOS>
here
we
obtain
a
hasty
meal
,
and
afterwards
take
the
train
down
to
Abo
,
where
we
arrive
next
morning
,
after
a
very
uncomfortable
and
sleepless
journey
.
 
<EOS>
at
nine
o'clock
I
stand
in
the
big
bare
office
of
Michael
Boranski
,
where
only
a
few
day
before
we
have
have
such
a
heated
argument
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
Chief
of
Police
enter
,
he
recognize
me
under
arrest
,
and
dismiss
my
guard
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
--
all
save
the
officer
who
have
bring
me
there
.
<EOS>
the
finnish
driver
and
the
old
wood
-
cutter
be
in
another
room
,
therefore
I
stand
alone
with
the
police
-
officer
of
Helsingfors
and
the
Chief
of
Police
at
Abo
.
<EOS>
the
latter
listen
to
the
officer
's
story
of
my
arrest
without
say
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
prisoner
,
your
Excellency
,
desire
to
be
bring
here
to
you
before
be
take
to
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
He
say
you
would
be
aware
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
I
be
,
"
remark
Boranski
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
You
must
at
once
release
this
gentleman
and
the
other
two
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
have
issue
order
for
the
prisoner
's
arrest
and
deportation
to
Helsingfors
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
Chief
of
Police
in
Abo
,
and
I
release
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
officer
look
at
me
in
such
blank
astonishment
that
I
could
not
resist
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
well
aware
of
the
reason
of
this
Englishman
's
visit
to
the
north
,
"
add
Boranski
.
<EOS>
"
More
need
not
be
say
.
<EOS>
have
the
lady
be
arrest
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
your
Excellency
.
<EOS>
every
effort
be
be
make
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Smirnoff
have
already
be
relieve
of
his
post
as
Governor
of
Kajana
,
and
many
of
the
guard
be
under
arrest
for
complicity
in
the
plot
to
allow
the
woman
to
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
see
from
the
despatch
that
a
reward
be
offer
for
her
recapture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
Governor
-
General
be
determined
that
she
shall
not
escape
,
"
remark
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
probably
hide
in
the
forest
,
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
They
be
make
a
thorough
search
over
every
verst
of
it
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
there
,
she
will
most
certainly
be
find
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
,
"
remark
Boranski
,
lean
back
in
his
padded
chair
and
look
at
me
meaningly
across
the
littered
table
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
I
wish
to
speak
to
this
Englishman
privately
,
so
please
leave
us
.
<EOS>
also
inform
the
other
two
prisoner
that
they
be
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
your
Excellency
do
this
upon
his
own
responsibility

"
he
say
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
remember
that
I
bring
them
to
you
under
arrest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
release
them
entirely
at
my
own
discretion
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
as
Chief
of
Police
of
this
province
,
I
be
permit
to
use
my
jurisdiction
,
and
I
exercise
it
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
You
be
liberty
to
report
that
at
Helsingfors
,
if
you
so
desire
,
but
I
should
suggest
that
you
say
nothing
unless
absolutely
oblige
--
you
understand
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
Boranski
speak
apparently
decide
my
captor
,
for
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
he
say
,
salute
:
 
"
if
that
be
really
your
wish
,
then
I
will
obey
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
leave
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excellency
!
"
exclaim
the
Chief
of
Police
,
rise
quickly
and
walk
towards
me
as
soon
as
the
door
be
closed
,
and
we
be
alone
,
"
you
have
have
a
very
narrow
escape
--
<EOS>
very
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
good
to
assist
you
.
<EOS>
I
succeed
in
bribe
the
water
-
guard
at
Kajana
in
order
that
you
may
secure
the
lady
's
release
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
just
at
the
very
moment
when
you
be
about
to
get
away
one
of
the
guard
turn
informer
and
rouse
the
governor
of
the
castle
,
with
the
result
that
you
all
three
nearly
lose
your
life

the
whole
matter
have
be
report
to
me
officially
,

,

he
add
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
my
man
be
now
search
everywhere
for
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
be
Baron
Oberg
so
extremely
anxious
to
recapture
Miss
Heath
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
idea
,
"
be
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
the
secret
order
from
helsingfor
to
me
be
to
arrest
her
at
all
hazard
--
alive
or
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
which
mean
that
the
Baron
would
not
regret
if
she
be
dead
,
"
I
remark
,
in
response
to
which
he
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
of
the
faithful
service
of
Felix
,
the
Finlander
<EOS>
,
whereupon
he
say
simply
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
you
may
trust
him
implicitly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
now
that
you
have
show
yourself
my
friend
<EOS>
,
"
I
say
,
"
you
will
assist
Miss
Heath
to
escape
this
man
,
who
desire
to
hold
her
prisoner
in
that
awful
place
.
<EOS>
They
be
drive
her
mad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
good
,
"
he
answer
,
but
shake
his
head
dubiously
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
recollect
that
Baron
Oberg
be
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
,
with
all
the
power
of
the
Czar
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
Elma
Heath
again
fall
into
his
unscrupulous
hand
,
she
will
die
,
"
I
declare
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
sigh
,
look
me
straight
in
the
face
,
"
I
fear
that
what
you
say
be
only
too
true
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
hold
some
secret
which
he
fear
she
will
reveal
.
<EOS>
He
wish
to
rearrest
her
in
order
--
<EOS>
well--
<EOS>
"
he
add
in
a
low
tone
,
"
in
order
to
close
her
lip
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
person
have
be
silence
in
secret
at
Kajana
.
<EOS>
many
fatal
accident
take
place
in
that
fortress

you
know

CHAPTER
XII
 
<EOS>
"
THE
STRANGLER
"
  
<EOS>
where
be
Elma
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
cause
of
her
inexplicable
disappearance
into
the
gloomy
forest
while
we
have
sleep
?
 
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
hotel
where
I
have
stay
on
my
arrival
,
a
comfortable
place
call
the
Phoenix
,
and
lunch
there
alone
.
<EOS>
both
Felix
,
the
Finn
,
and
my
host
,
the
wood
-
cutter
,
have
receive
their
_
douceur
_
and
leave
,
but
to
the
last
-
name
I
have
give
instruction
to
return
home
at
once
and
report
by
telegraph
any
news
of
my
lost
one
.
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
conflict
thought
arise
within
me
as
I
sit
in
that
crowd
_
salle
-
a
-
manger
<EOS>
_
fill
with
a
gobble
crowd
of
the
commercial
man
of
Abo
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
I
recognize
,
now
to
deal
with
the
most
powerful
man
in
that
country
,
and
I
suffer
a
distinct
disadvantage
by
be
in
ignorance
of
the
reason
he
hold
that
sweet
English
girl
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
the
tragedy
of
the
dastardly
manner
in
which
she
have
be
willfully
maim
cause
my
blood
to
boil
within
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
believe
that
in
this
civilized
twentieth
century
such
thing
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
Michael
Boranski
have
give
his
pledge
to
assist
me
,
yet
he
have
most
plainly
explain
to
me
his
fear
.
<EOS>
the
Baron
be
intent
upon
again
get
Elma
into
his
power
.
<EOS>
be
it
at
his
order
,
I
wonder
,
that
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
have
be
deprive
of
speech
and
hearing
?
<EOS>
have
she
fall
an
innocent
victim
to
his
infamous
scheming
?
 
<EOS>
about
me
man
be
eat
strange
dish
and
talk
in
Finnish
,
while
other
be
smoke
and
drink
their
vodka
;
but
I
be
in
no
mood
for
observation
.
<EOS>
My
only
thought
be
of
she
who
be
now
lose
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
she
disappear
without
warn
I
be
at
loss
to
imagine
,
yet
I
could
only
surmise
that
her
flight
have
be
compulsory
.
<EOS>
some
woman
possess
a
mysterious
sense
of
intuition
,
a
curious
and
indescribable
faculty
of
know
when
evil
threaten
them
,
that
present
a
strange
and
puzzling
problem
to
our
scientist
.
<EOS>
It
be
unaccountable
,
and
yet
many
woman
possess
it
in
a
very
marked
degree
.
<EOS>
be
it
,
therefore
,
possible
that
Elma
have
awaken
,
and
be
warn
of
her
peril
have
flee
without
arouse
us
?
<EOS>
the
suggestion
be
possible
,
but
I
fear
improbable
.
 
<EOS>
another
very
curious
feature
in
the
affair
be
the
sudden
manner
in
which
Michael
Boranski
have
exert
his
power
and
influence
in
order
to
render
me
that
service
.
<EOS>
He
have
actually
bribe
the
guard
of
Kajana
;
he
have
instruct
the
faithful
Felix
,
he
have
provide
our
boat
,
and
he
have
order
the
nun
to
open
the
water
-
gate
to
me
.
<EOS>
why
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
<EOS>
I
feel
convinced
,
some
hide
motive
in
all
that
sudden
and
mark
friendliness
.
<EOS>
that
he
really
hate
the
English
I
have
see
plainly
when
we
have
first
meet
,
and
I
have
only
compel
him
to
serve
me
by
present
the
order
sign
by
the
Emperor
,
which
make
me
his
guest
within
the
russian
dominion
.
<EOS>
even
that
document
do
not
account
for
the
length
he
have
go
to
secure
the
release
of
the
woman
I
now
love
in
secret
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
it
over
,
the
more
anxious
do
I
become
.
<EOS>
I
could
discern
no
motive
for
his
friendliness
,
and
,
truth
to
tell
,
I
always
distrust
those
who
be
too
friendly
.
<EOS>
what
straight
and
decide
line
of
action
should
I
take
?
<EOS>
carefully
I
go
over
all
the
strange
event
that
have
happen
in
England
,
and
while
anxious
to
obtain
some
solution
of
the
amazing
problem
,
yet
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
leave
Finland
,
and
allow
Elma
to
fall
into
the
clutch
of
that
high
official
who
so
persistently
seek
her
end
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
would
go
to
him
and
face
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
anxious
to
see
what
manner
of
man
be
"
the
Strangler
of
Finland
.
"
<EOS>
therefore
,
that
same
evening
I
leave
Abo
,
and
travel
by
rail
up
to
the
junction
<EOS>
Toijala
,
whence
<EOS>
,
after
a
wait
of
six
hour
,
I
resume
by
slow
journey
to
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
I
put
up
at
Kamp
's
,
an
elegant
hotel
on
the
long
esplanade
overlook
the
port
,
and
find
the
town
,
with
its
handsome
street
and
spacious
square
,
to
be
a
much
fine
place
than
I
have
believe
.
<EOS>
when
I
inquire
of
the
french
director
of
my
hotel
for
the
residence
of
his
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
,
he
regard
me
with
some
surprise
,
say
:
 
"
the
Baron
live
up
at
the
Palace
,
m'sieur
--
<EOS>
that
great
building
opposite
the
Salutong
.
<EOS>
the
driver
of
your
drosky
will
point
it
out
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
his
Excellency
in
Helsingfors
at
the
present
moment
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Baron
never
leave
the
Palace
,
m'sieur
,
"
respond
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
strange
country
,
you
know
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
say
that
his
Excellency
be
in
hourly
fear
of
assassination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
without
cause
,
"
I
remark
in
a
low
voice
,
at
which
he
elevate
his
shoulder
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
at
noon
I
descend
from
a
drosky
before
a
long
,
gray
,
massive
building
,
over
the
big
doorway
of
which
<EOS>
be
a
large
escutcheon
bear
the
russian
arm
emblazon
in
gold
,
and
on
enter
where
a
sentry
stand
on
either
side
,
a
colossal
concierge
in
livery
of
bright
blue
and
gold
come
forward
to
meet
me
,
ask
in
Russian
:
 
<EOS>
"
whom
do
you
wish
to
see
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
an
appointment
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
see
no
one
without
an
appointment
,
"
the
man
tell
me
somewhat
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
here
on
public
business
,
but
upon
a
private
matter
,
"
I
explain
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
may
see
his
Excellency
's
secretary
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
you
wish
,
but
I
repeat
that
his
Excellency
see
no
one
without
a
previous
appointment
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
quite
well
,
for
the
"
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
fearful
of
assassination
,
be
as
unapproachable
as
the
Czar
himself
.
<EOS>
follow
the
direction
of
the
concierge
,
however
,
I
cross
a
great
bare
courtyard
,
and
,
ascend
a
wide
stone
staircase
,
be
confront
by
a
servant
,
who
,
on
hear
my
inquiry
take
me
into
a
waiting
-
room
,
and
leave
with
my
card
to
Colonel
Luganski
,
whom
he
inform
me
be
the
Baron
's
private
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
after
ten
minute
or
so
the
man
return
,
say
:
 
"
the
Colonel
will
see
you
if
you
will
please
step
this
way
,
"
and
follow
him
he
conduct
me
into
the
richly
furnish
private
apartment
of
the
Palace
,
across
a
great
hall
fill
with
fine
painting
,
and
then
up
a
long
thickly
-
carpet
passage
to
a
small
,
elegant
room
,
where
a
tall
bald
-
head
man
in
military
uniform
stand
await
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
name
be
M'sieur
Gregg
,
"
he
exclaim
in
very
good
French
,
"
and
I
understand
you
desire
audience
of
his
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
.
<EOS>
I
regret
,
however
,
that
he
never
give
audience
to
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
matter
upon
which
I
desire
to
see
his
Excellency
be
of
a
purely
private
and
confidential
nature
,
"
I
say
,
for
use
as
I
be
to
the
way
of
foreign
officialdom
,
I
speak
with
the
same
firm
courtesy
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
m'sieur
,
but
I
fear
it
will
be
necessary
in
that
case
for
you
to
write
to
his
Excellency
,
and
mark
your
letter
'
personal
.
'
<EOS>
It
will
then
go
into
the
Governor
-
General
's
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
I
have
to
say
can
not
be
commit
to
writing
,
"
be
my
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
Baron
Oberg
upon
a
matter
which
affect
him
personally
,
and
which
admit
of
no
delay
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
glance
at
me
quickly
,
and
then
in
a
low
voice
inquire
:
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
in
regard
to
a
--
well
,
a
conspiracy
?
"
 
<EOS>
His
question
instantly
suggest
to
me
a
ruse
,
and
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
can
place
the
fact
before
me
without
the
slight
hesitation
,
"
he
say
,
go
to
the
door
and
slip
the
bolt
into
its
socket
.
<EOS>
"
anything
speak
into
my
ear
be
as
though
it
be
speak
into
that
of
his
Excellency
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
much
regret
,
M'sieur
the
Colonel
,
that
I
must
see
the
Baron
in
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
the
plot
assassination
as
its
object
--
or
revolt
?
"
he
ask
pointedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
will
explain
to
the
Baron
only
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
tell
you
he
will
not
see
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
so
many
person
here
with
secret
information
concern
finnish
conspiracy
against
our
russian
rule
.
<EOS>
why
,
if
his
Excellency
see
everyone
who
desire
to
see
him
,
he
would
be
compel
to
give
audience
the
whole
twenty
-
four
hour
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
a
glance
I
see
that
this
elegant
Colonel
,
who
seem
to
take
the
great
pride
over
his
exquisitely
keep
person
and
his
spotless
uniform
,
do
not
intend
to
allow
me
the
satisfaction
of
an
audience
of
that
most
hate
official
of
the
Czar
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
in
fear
of
the
dagger
,
the
pistol
,
or
the
bomb
,
and
consequently
hedge
himself
in
by
person
of
the
Colonel
's
type
--
courteous
,
diplomatic
,
but
utterly
unbend
.
<EOS>
after
some
further
argument
,
I
say
at
last
in
a
firm
tone
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
impress
upon
you
the
extreme
importance
of
the
information
I
have
to
impart
,
and
can
only
repeat
that
it
be
a
matter
concern
his
Excellency
privately
.
<EOS>
Will
you
therefore
do
me
the
favor
to
take
my
name
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
refuse
to
be
trouble
with
the
name
of
stranger
,
"
be
his
cold
reply
,
as
he
turn
over
my
card
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
write
upon
it
the
nature
of
my
business
,
and
enclose
it
in
an
envelope
,
will
you
then
take
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitate
for
a
short
time
,
twist
his
mustache
,
and
then
reply
with
great
reluctance
:
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
you
be
so
determined
,
you
may
write
your
business
upon
your
card
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
take
out
one
,
and
on
the
back
write
in
French
the
word
which
I
know
must
have
the
effect
of
obtain
an
audience
for
me
:
     
"
_
to
give
information
regard
Miss
Elma
Heath
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
I
enclose
in
the
envelope
he
hand
to
me
,
when
,
ring
a
bell
,
he
hand
it
to
the
footman
who
appear
,
with
order
to
take
it
to
his
Excellency
and
await
a
reply
.
<EOS>
the
response
come
in
a
few
minute
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
will
give
audience
to
the
English
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
I
rise
and
follow
the
footman
through
several
wide
corridor
fill
with
palm
and
flower
,
which
form
a
kind
of
winter
-
garden
,
until
we
cross
a
red
-
carpet
ante
-
room
,
where
two
statuesque
sentry
stand
on
guard
,
and
the
man
conduct
me
rap
at
the
great
polished
mahogany
door
of
the
room
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
a
voice
respond
,
the
door
be
open
,
and
I
find
myself
in
a
high
,
beautifully
-
paint
room
,
with
long
window
hang
with
pastel
-
blue
silk
with
heavy
gilt
fringe
,
a
pastel

blue
carpet
,
and
upon
the
opposite
wall
a
great
canopy
of
rich
purple
velvet
bear
the
double

head
eagle
embroider
in
gold
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
splendidly
decorate
,
and
in
the
center
of
the
parquet
floor
,
with
his
back
to
the
light
,
be
the
thin
,
wiry
figure
of
an
elderly
man
in
a
funereal
frock
-
coat
,
in
the
lapel
of
which
show
the
red
and
yellow
ribbon
of
the
order
of
Saint
Anne
.
<EOS>
His
hand
be
behind
his
back
,
and
he
stand
purposely
in
such
a
position
that
when
I
enter
I
could
not
at
first
see
his
face
against
the
strong
,
gray
light
behind
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
footman
have
bow
and
retire
and
we
be
alone
,
he
turn
slightly
,
and
I
then
see
that
his
bony
face
,
with
high
cheek
-
bone
,
slight
gray
side
-
whisker
,
hard
mouth
and
black
eye
set
closely
together
,
be
one
that
bear
the
mark
of
evil
upon
it
--
<EOS>
the
keen
,
sinister
countenance
of
one
who
could
act
without
any
compunction
and
without
regret
.
<EOS>
truly
one
would
not
be
surprised
at
any
cruel
,
dastardly
action
of
a
man
with
such
a
face
--
the
face
of
an
oppressor
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
he
snap
in
French
in
a
high
-
pitch
voice
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
see
me
concern
that
mad
english

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
"
I
have
no

be
my
quick

,
as
I
face
him
unflinchingly

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
I
guess

<EOS>
I

"
<EOS>
and
I
see
that
his
thin
,
crafty
face
go
pale
,
while
his
eye
glance
evilly
upon
me
.
<EOS>
He
believe
that
she
have
reveal
to
me
her
secret

<EOS>
He
place
his
hand
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
wherein
be
conceal
an
electric
button
,
and
next
instant
a
little
stout

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
stand
before
the
thin

of
the
Czar

the
unscrupulous
man
who

Finland

agent

"
<EOS>
and
then
he
threaten
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
untrue
,
"
I
protest
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
merely
call
to
see
you
regard
the
young
english
lady
,
Elma
Heath
--
the
unfortunate
lady
whom
you
consign
to
the
fortress
of
Kajana
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
mad
woman
,
you
mean
!
"
<EOS>
he
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
mad
,
"
I
cry
,
"
but
as
sane
as
you
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
who
intend
that
the
horror
of
the
castle
should
drive
her
insane
,
and
thus
your
secret
should
be
keep
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
suggest
?
<EOS>
"
he
demand
,
step
a
few
pace
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
Xavier
Oberg
,
that
you
would
kill
Elma
Heath
if
you
dare
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
"
I
answer
plainly
,
as
I
face
him
unflinchingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
"
he
laugh
,
turn
to
the
stout
man
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
insane
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
what
he
be
talk
about
.
<EOS>
ah
,
my
dear
Malkoff
,
I
have
have
a
narrow
escape
!
<EOS>
He
come
here
intend
to
shoot
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
I
protest
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
here
to
demand
satisfaction
on
behalf
of
Miss
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh!--well
,
if
the
lady
care
to
come
here
herself
,
I
will
give
her
the
satisfaction
she
desire
,
"
be
his
crafty
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
lady
have
escape
you
,
and
it
be
therefore
hardly
likely
she
will
willingly
return
to
Helsingfors
,
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
you
who
succeed
,
by
throw
the
guard
into
the
water
,
in
abduct
her
from
the
castle
,
"
he
remark
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
he
add
sneeringly
,
with
a
sinister
smile
,
"
I
presume
your
gallantry
be
prompt
by
affection
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
own
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
deaf
and
dumb
woman
be
surely
not
a
very
cheerful
companion
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
cause
her
that
affliction
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
when
she
be
at
Chichester
she
possess
speech
and
hearing
as
other
girl
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
not
afflict
when
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
in
Leghorn
harbor
only
a
few
month
ago
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
recollect
the
narrow
escape
the
yacht
have
on
the
Meloria
sand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
eye
meet
mine
,
and
I
see
by
his
drawn
face
and
narrow
brow
that
my
word
be
cause
him
the
utmost
consternation
.
<EOS>
My
object
be
to
make
him
believe
that
I
know
more
than
I
really
do
--
to
hold
him
in
fear
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
the
man
whom
some
know
as
Hornby
,
or
Woodroffe
,
could
tell
an
interesting
story
,
"
I
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
,
no
doubt
,
when
he
meet
Elma
Heath
,
and
find
the
terrible
affliction
of
which
she
have
be
the
victim
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
thin
,
bony
countenance
be
bloodless
,
his
mouth
twitch
and
his
gray
brow
contract
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
<EOS>
what
you
mean
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
he
stammer
.
<EOS>
"
all
that
you
say
be
entirely
enigmatical
to
me
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
to
do
with
this
mad
Englishwoman
's
affair
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
send
out
this
man
,
"
I
say
,
point
to
the
detective
Malkoff
,
who
have
appear
from
behind
the
paneling
of
the
audience
-
chamber
.
"
<EOS>
send
him
out
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
representative
of
the
Czar
,
always
as
much
in
dread
of
assassination
as
his
imperial
master
,
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
what
I
have
say
have
upset
him
,
and
that
he
be
not
at
all
clear
as
to
how
much
or
how
little
of
the
true
fact
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
connection
between
the
little
miniature
cross
of
the
Order
of
St.
Anne
and
that
red
and
yellow
ribbon
in
his
button
-
hole
strike
me
forcibly
at
that
moment
,
and
I
say
:
 
"
I
have
no
desire
to
make
any
statement
before
a
second
person
.
<EOS>
I
come
here
to
see
you
privately
,
and
in
private
will
I
speak
.
<EOS>
I
have
certain
information
that
will
<EOS>
,
I
feel
confident
,
be
of
the
utmost
interest
to
you
--
concern
another
woman
,
Armida
Santini
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
lip
be
press
together
,
and
I
notice
how
he
start
when
I
utter
the
name
of
that
woman
whom
I
have
find
dead
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
and
whose
body
have
so
mysteriously
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
on
earth
can
the
woman
concern
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
with
a
brave
attempt
to
remain
cool
,
still
speak
in
French
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
that
you
know
her
,
"
be
my
brief
reply
.
<EOS>
then
,
with
my
eye
still
fix
upon
his
,
I
ask
:
"
Will
you
not
now
request
this
gentleman
to
retire
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
dismiss
the
man
he
have
summon
to
his
aid
.
<EOS>
a
moment
later
the
"
Strangler
's
"
personal
protector
have
disappear
through
that
secret
door
in
the
paneling
by
which
he
have
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
ask
the
Baron
,
turn
quickly
to
me
again
,
his
dark
,
evil
eye
try
to
fathom
my
intention
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
,
pray
,
can
you
profit
by
denounce
me
as
an
assassin
?
<EOS>
remember
,
Baron
,
that
your
secret
be
mine
<EOS>
,
"
I
say
in
a
clear
voice
full
of
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
your
intention
be
blackmail
--
eh
?
"
he
snap
,
walk
to
the
window
and
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
how
much
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
intention
be
nothing
of
the
kind

My
object
be
to
avenge
the
outrageous
injury
to
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
that
be
only
natural
,
m'sieur
,
if
you
have
fall
in
love
with
her
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
be
not
your
intention
somewhat
ill
-
advise
consider
her
position
as
a
criminal
lunatic
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
neither
,
"
I
protest
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
You
know
better
than
myself
,
"
he
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
the
offense
for
which
she
be
condemn
to
confinement
in
a
fortress
be
the
attempt
assassination
of
Madame
Vakuroff
,
wife
of
the
General
command
the
Uleaborg
Military
Division
.
"
 
"
assassination
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
have
you
actually
send
her
to
prison
as
a
murderess
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
the
Criminal
Court
of
Abo
do
so
,
"
he
say
dryly
.
<EOS>
"
the
offense
have
since
be
prove
to
have
be
the
outcome
of
a
political
conspiracy
,
and
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
in
Petersburg
last
week
sign
an
order
for
the
prisoner
's
transportation
to
the
island
of
Saghalien

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
remark
with
set
tooth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
you
fear
lest
she
shall
write
down
your
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
insult
!
<EOS>
You
evidently
do
not
know
what
you
be
say
,

he
exclaim
resentfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
be
say
quite
well

<EOS>
You
have
request
her
removal
to
Saghalien
in
order
that
the
truth
shall
be
never
know

<EOS>
but
Baron
Oberg
,

I
add
with
mock
politeness
,
"
you
may
do
as
you
will
,
you
may
send
Elma
Heath
to
her
grave
,
you
may
hold
me
prisoner
if
you
dare
,
but
there
be
still
witness
of
your
crime
that
will
rise
against
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
he
go
ghastly
pale
,
and
I
know
that
my
blind
shot
have
strike
its
mark
.
<EOS>
the
man
before
me
be
guilty
of
some
crime
,
but
what
it
be
only
Elma
herself
could
tell
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
have
her
arrest
for
an
attempt
political
assassination
<EOS>
only
show
how
ingeniously
and
craftily
the
heartless
ruler
of
that
ruin
country
have
lay
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
fear
Elma
,
and
therefore
have
conspire
to
have
her
send
out
to
that
dismal
penal
island
in
the
far
-
off
Pacific
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
fear
arrest
,
m'sieur
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
,
as
though
with
some
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
in
the
least
--
at
least
,
not
arrest
by
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
the
representative
of
the
Emperor
in
Finland
,
but
even
here
there
be
justice
for
the
innocent
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
sinister
smile
play
around
the
thin
,
gray
lip
of
the
man
whose
very
name
be
hate
through
the
great
empire
of
the
Czar
,
and
be
synonymous
of
oppression
,
injustice
,
and
heartless
tyranny
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
I
can
repeat
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
that
if
you
bring
the
young
Englishwoman
here
I
shall
be
quite
prepared
to
hear
her
appeal
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
laugh
harshly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ask
that
because
you
know
it
be
impossible
,
"
I
say
,
whereat
he
again
laugh
in
my
face
--
a
laugh
which
make
me
wonder
whether
Elma
have
not
already
fall
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
uncertainty
of
her
fate
hold
me
in
terrible
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
merely
wish
to
impress
upon
you
the
fact
that
I
have
not
the
slight
interest
whatsoever
in
the
person
in
question
,

he
say
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
form
some
romantic
attachment
towards
this
young
woman
who
attempt
to
poison
Madame
Vakuroff
,
and
to
have
succeed
in
rescue
her
from
Kajana

<EOS>
You
afterwards
disregard
the
fact
that
you
be
liable
to
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
yourself
,
and
actually
have
the
audacity
to
seek
audience
of
me
and
make
all
sort
of
hint
and
suggestion
that
I
have
hold
the
woman
a
prisoner
for
my
own
end
!

"
 
<EOS>
"
not
only
do
I
repeat
that
,
Baron
Oberg
,
"
I
say
quickly
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
also
allege
that
it
be
at
your
instigation
that
in
Siena
an
operation
be
perform
upon
the
unfortunate
girl

deprive
her
of
speech

at
my
instigation

<EOS>
"
yes
,
at
yours
!

<EOS>
He
laugh
again
,
but
uneasily
,
a
force
laugh
,
and
lean
against
the
edge
of
the
big
writing
-
table
near
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
next
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
,
pretend
to
be
interested
in
my
allegation
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
of
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
to
give
the
Mademoiselle
Heath
her
complete
freedom

I
say

be
that
all

<EOS>
"
all

for
the
present

but
her
future
be
not
in

hand

the
Minister
in
Petersburg
have
decree
her
removal
to
Saghalien
as
a
person
dangerous
to
the
State

which
mean
that
she
will
be
ill
-
treat
--
knoute
to
death

perhaps
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
use
the
knout
in
the
russian
prison

he
say
briefly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
have
decree
its
abolition

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
adopt
torture

Schusselburg
instead

My

too
limited

exclaim
impatiently
,
while
I
could
well
see
that
he
be
anxious
to
escape
before
I
make
any
further
charge
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
show
him
that
Elma
have
speak
,
and
he
fear
that
she
have
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
while
this
would
embitter
him
against
her
and
cause
him
to
seek
to
silence
her
at
all
hazard
,
it
be
of
course
in
my
own
interest
that
he
should
fear
any
revelation
that
I
may
make

You

pose

murder

yes

strange
,
high
-
pitch
key
as
he
throw
himself
into
a
chair

scribble
something
rapidly

append
his

<EOS>
"
and
so
shall
I
,
"
he
say
with
an
evil
grin
upon
his
bony
face
as
he
blot
what
he
have
write
and
take
it
up
,
add
:
"
in
the
darkness
and
silence
of
your
living
tomb
,
you
can
tell
whatever
strange
story
you
like
concern
me
.
<EOS>
They
be
use
to
idiot
where
you
be
go
,
"
he
add
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
and
where
be
I
go
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
back
to
Kanaja
.
<EOS>
this
order
consign
you
to
confinement
there
as
a
dangerous
political
conspirator
,
as
one
who
have
threaten
me
--
it
consign
you
to
the
cell
below
the
lake
--
for
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
laugh
aloud
,
and
my
hand
seek
my
wallet
wherein
<EOS>
be
that
all
-
powerful
document
--
the
order
of
the
Emperor
which
give
me
,
as
an
imperial
guest
,
immunity
from
arrest
.
<EOS>
I
would
produce
it
as
my
trump
-
card
.
 
<EOS>
next
second
,
however
,
I
hold
my
breath
,
and
I
think
I
must
have
turn
pale
.
<EOS>
My
pocket
be
empty
!
<EOS>
My
wallet
have
be
steal
!
<EOS>
entirely
and
helplessly
I
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
tyrant
of
the
Czar
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
personal
interest
would
be
to
consign
me
to
a
live
tomb
in
that
grim
fortress
of
Kajana
,
the
horror
of
which
be
unspeakable
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
enough
during
my
inspection
of
the
russian
prison
as
a
journalist
to
know
that
there
,
in
strangle
Finland
,
I
should
not
be
treat
with
the
same
consideration
or
humanity
as
in
Petersburg
or
Warsaw
.
<EOS>
the
Governor
-
General
consign
me
to
Kajana
as
a
"
political
,
"
which
be
synonymous
with
a
sentence
of
death
in
those
damp
,
dark
_
oubliette
_
beneath
the
water
-
dungeon
every
whit
as
awful
as
those
of
the
Paris
Bastile
.
 
<EOS>
We
face
each
other
,
and
I
look
straight
into
his
gray
,
bony
face
,
and
answer
in
a
tone
of
defiance
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
Governor
-
General
,
it
be
true
,
but
you
will
,
I
think
,
reflect
before
you
consign
me
,
an
Englishman
,
to
prison
without
trial
.
<EOS>
I
know
full
well
that
the
English
be
hate
by
Russia
,
yet
I
assure
you
that
in
London
we
entertain
no
love
for
your
nation
or
its
method
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
laugh
,
"
you
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Russia
have
no
use
for
an
effete
ally
such
as
England
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
effete
or
powerful
,
my
country
be
still
able
to
present
an
ultimatum
when
diplomacy
require
it
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
therefore
I
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
send
me
to
prison
,
and
I
tell
you
that
the
responsibility
rest
upon
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
and
fold
my
arm
I
keep
my
eye
intently
upon
his
,
so
that
he
should
not
see
that
I
waver
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
for
the
responsibility
,
I
certainly
do
not
fear
that
,
m'sieur
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
exposure
that
will
result
--
be
you
prepared
to
face
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
be
not
aware
that
other
beside
myself
--
one
other
,
indeed
,
who
be
a
diplomatist
--
be
aware
of
my
journey
here
?
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
return
,
your
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
in
Petersburg
will
be
press
for
a
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
which
they
will
not
give
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
if
they
do
not
,
the
truth
will
be
out
,
"
I
say
laugh
harshly
,
for
I
see
how
determined
he
have
become
to
hold
me
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
call
up
your
myrmidon
and
send
me
to
Kajana
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
first
step
towards
your
own
downfall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
he
growl
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
you
surely
do
not
think
that
I
,
after
ten
year
'
service
in
the
british
diplomatic
service
,
would
dare
to
come
to
Finland
upon
this
quest
--
would
dare
to
face
the
rotten
and
corrupt
officialdom
which
Russia
have
place
within
this
country
--
without
first
take
some
adequate
precaution
?
<EOS>
no
,
Baron
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
defy
you
,
and
I
leave
Helsingfors
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
.
<EOS>
You
be
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
laugh
heartily
and
snap
my
finger
,
say
:
 
"
before
you
give
me
over
to
your
police
,
first
telegraph
to
your
Minister
of
Finance
,
Monsieur
de
Witte
,
and
inquire
of
him
who
and
what
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
merely
to
send
my
name
and
description
to
the
Minister
and
ask
for
a
reply
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
give
you
instruction
--
or
,
if
you
so
desire
,
ask
his
Majesty
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
why
,
pray
,
do
his
Majesty
concern
himself
about
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
at
once
puzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
learn
later
,
after
I
be
confine
in
Kajana
and
your
secret
be
know
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
mean
that
I
have
take
all
the
necessary
step
to
be
forearm
against
you
.
<EOS>
the
day
I
be
incarcerate
by
your
order
,
the
whole
truth
will
be
know
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
the
sufferer
--
but
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
word
,
purposely
enigmatical
,
mislead
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
drift
of
my
argument
,
and
be
of
course
unaware
of
how
much
I
know
,
he
be
still
in
fear
of
me
.
<EOS>
My
only
uncertainty
be
of
the
actual
fate
of
poor
Elma
.
<EOS>
My
wallet
have
be
steal
--
with
a
purpose
,
without
a
doubt
--
for
the
thief
have
deprive
me
of
that
most
important
of
all
document
,
the
open
sesame
to
every
closed
door
,
the
ukase
of
the
Czar
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
defy
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
hoarsely
,
turn
back
to
the
window
with
the
write
order
for
my
imprisonment
as
a
political
still
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
but
we
shall
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
rule
Finland
,
"
I
say
in
a
hard
tone
,
"
but
you
have
no
power
over
Gordon
Gregg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
power
,
and
intend
to
exert
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
your
own
ruin
,
"
I
remark
with
a
self
-
confident
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
give
your
torturer
order
to
kill
me
--
order
that
a
fatal
accident
shall
occur
within
the
fortress
--
but
I
tell
you
frankly
that
my
death
will
neither
erase
nor
conceal
your
own
offense
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
,
away
in
England
,
who
be
aware
of
them
,
and
who
will
,
in
order
to
avenge
my
death
,
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
remember
that
although
Elma
Heath
have
be
deprive
of
both
hearing
and
of
speech
,
she
can
still
write
down
the
true
fact
in
black
and
white
.
<EOS>
the
Czar
may
be
your
patron
,
and
you
his
favorite
,
but
his
Majesty
have
no
tolerance
of
official
who
be
guilty
of
what
you
be
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
arrest
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
add
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
ought
rather
to
go
on
your
knee
and
beg
my
silence
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
go
white
with
rage
at
my
cutting
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
He
literally
boil
over
,
for
he
see
that
I
be
quite
cool
and
have
no
fear
of
him
or
of
the
terrible
punishment
to
which
he
intend
to
consign
me
.
<EOS>
besides
which
,
he
be
fill
with
wonder
regard
the
exact
amount
of
information
which
Elma
have
impart
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
certain
person
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
to
whom
it
would
be
of
intense
interest
to
know
the
true
reason
why
the
steam
-
yacht
_
Lola
_
put
into
Leghorn
;
why
I
be
entertain
on
board
her
;
why
the
safe
in
the
British
Consulate
be
rifle
,
and
why
the
unfortunate
girl
,
keep
a
prisoner
on
board
,
be
take
on
shore
just
before
the
hurried
sailing
of
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
other
mystery
which
the
english
police
be
try
to
solve
,
namely
,
the
reason
Armida
Santini
and
a
man
disguise
as
her
husband
die
in
Scotland
at
the
hand
of
an
assassin
.
<EOS>
but
surely
I
need
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
be
surely
sufficient
to
convince
you
that
if
the
truth
be
speak
,
the
revelation
would
be
distinctly
awkward
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
whom
?
"
he
ask
,
open
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
you
.
<EOS>
come
,
Baron
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
can
we
not
yet
speak
frankly
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
silent
for
a
moment
,
a
fact
which
be
in
itself
proof
that
my
pointed
argument
have
cause
him
to
reconsider
his
intention
of
send
me
under
escort
back
to
that
castle
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
if
my
journey
there
be
in
order
to
meet
my
love
,
I
would
not
have
care
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
ignorance
of
her
whereabouts
or
of
her
fate
that
hold
me
in
such
deep
,
all
-
consume
anxiety
.
<EOS>
each
hour
that
pass
increase
my
fond
and
tender
affection
for
her
.
<EOS>
and
yet
what
irony
of
circumstance
!
<EOS>
She
have
be
cruelly
snatch
from
me
at
the
very
moment
that
freedom
have
be
ours
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
well
that
I
assume
that
air
of
defiance
with
the
man
who
have
grind
Finland
beneath
his
heel
.
<EOS>
He
be
unused
to
it
.
<EOS>
no
one
dare
to
go
against
his
will
,
or
to
utter
taunt
or
threat
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
paramount
,
with
all
the
power
of
an
emperor
--
the
power
,
indeed
,
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
be
not
in
the
habit
of
be
either
thwart
or
criticise
,
and
I
could
see
that
my
word
have
arouse
within
him
a
boiling
tumult
of
resentment
and
of
rage
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
nothing
of
the
loss
of
my
wallet
or
of
the
precious
document
that
it
have
contain
.
<EOS>
My
defiance
be
merely
upon
principle
.
 
<EOS>
"
arrest
me
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
denounce
me
by
mean
of
any
lie
that
arise
to
your
lip
,
but
remember
that
the
truth
be
know
beyond
the
confine
of
the
Russian
Empire
,
and
for
that
reason
trace
will
be
seek
of
me
and
full
explanation
demand
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
precaution
,
Xavier
Oberg
,
<EOS>
"
I
add
,
"
therefore
do
your
bad
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
again
that
I
defy
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
pace
the
big
room
,
his
thin
claw
-
like
hand
still
clench
,
his
yellow
tooth
grind
,
his
dark
,
deep
-
set
eye
fix
straight
before
him
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
dare
,
he
would
have
strike
me
down
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
dare
.
<EOS>
I
see
too
plainly
that
even
though
my
wallet
be
go
I
still
hold
the
trump
-
card
--
that
he
fear
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
mention
I
have
make
of
the
Minister
of
Finance
,
however
,
seem
to
cause
him
considerable
hesitation
.
<EOS>
that
high
official
have
the
ear
of
the
Emperor
,
and
if
I
be
a
friend
there
may
be
inquiry
.
<EOS>
as
I
stand
before
him
lean
against
a
small
buhl
table
,
I
watch
all
the
complex
working
of
his
mind
,
and
try
to
read
the
mysterious
motive
which
have
cause
him
to
consign
poor
Elma
to
Kajana
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
proud
bully
,
possess
neither
pity
nor
remorse
,
an
average
speciman
of
the
high
russian
official
,
a
hide
-
bind
bureaucrat
,
a
slave
to
etiquette
and
possess
a
veneer
of
polish
.
<EOS>
but
beneath
it
all
I
see
that
he
be
a
coward
in
deadly
fear
of
assassination
--
a
coward
who
dread
lest
some
secret
should
be
reveal
.
<EOS>
that
conceal
door
in
the
paneling
with
the
armed
guard
lurk
behind
be
sufficiently
plain
evidence
that
he
be
not
the
fearless
Governor
-
General
that
be
popularly
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
,
"
the
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
have
crush
the
gallant
nation
into
submission
,
ruin
their
commerce
,
sap
the
country
by
impress
its
youth
into
the
russian
army
,
forbid
the
use
of
the
finnish
language
,
and
tax
the
people
until
the
factory
have
be
compel
to
close
down
while
the
peasantry
starve
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
on
the
verge
of
revolt
,
there
have
arise
a
band
of
patriot
who
resent
ruin
,
and
who
have
already
warn
his
Majesty
by
letter
that
if
Baron
Oberg
be
not
remove
from
his
post
he
would
die
.
 
<EOS>
these
and
other
thought
run
through
my
mind
in
the
silence
that
follow
our
heated
argument
,
for
I
see
well
that
he
be
in
actual
fear
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
lead
him
to
believe
that
I
know
everything
,
and
that
his
future
be
in
my
hand
,
while
he
,
on
his
part
,
be
anxious
to
hold
me
prisoner
,
and
yet
dare
not
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
wallet
have
probably
be
steal
by
some
lurk
police
-
spy
,
for
russian
agent
abound
everywhere
in
Finland
,
report
conspiracy
that
do
not
exist
and
denounce
the
innocent
as
"
political
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Baron
have
halt
,
and
be
look
through
one
of
the
great
window
down
upon
the
courtyard
below
where
the
sentry
be
pace
.
<EOS>
the
palace
be
for
him
a
gild
prison
,
for
he
dare
not
go
out
for
a
drive
in
one
or
other
of
the
park
or
for
a
blow
on
the
water
across
to
Hogholmen
or
Dagero
,
be
compel
to
remain
there
for
month
without
show
himself
publicly
.
<EOS>
People
in
Abo
have
tell
me
that
when
he
do
go
out
into
the
street
of
Helsingfors
<EOS>
it
be
at
night
,
and
he
usually
disguise
himself
in
the
uniform
of
a
private
soldier
of
the
guard
,
thus
escape
recognition
by
those
who
,
drive
to
desperation
by
injustice
,
seek
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
a
long
silence
have
fall
between
us
,
and
it
now
occur
to
me
to
take
advantage
of
his
hesitation
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
say
in
a
firm
voice
,
in
French--
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Baron
,
our
interview
be
at
an
end
,
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
therefore
I
wish
you
good
-
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
turn
upon
me
suddenly
with
an
evil
flash
in
his
dark
eye
,
and
a
snarl
imprecation
in
Russian
upon
his
lip
.
<EOS>
His
hand
still
hold
the
order
commit
me
to
the
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
before
I
leave
you
will
destroy
that
document
.
<EOS>
It
may
fall
into
other
hand
,
you
know
,
"
and
I
walk
towards
him
with
quick
determination
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
!
"
<EOS>
he
snap
.
 
<EOS>
without
further
word
I
snatch
the
paper
from
his
thin
white
finger
and
tear
it
up
before
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
go
livid
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
see
a
man
's
face
assume
such
an
expression
of
fiendish
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
though
at
that
instant
hell
have
be
let
loose
within
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
turn
upon
my
heel
and
go
out
,
pass
the
sentry
in
the
ante
-
room
,
along
the
flower
-
fill
corridor
and
across
the
courtyard
to
the
main
entrance
where
the
gorgeous
concierge
salute
me
as
I
step
forth
into
the
square
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
escape
by
mean
of
my
own
diplomacy
and
firmness
.
<EOS>
the
Czar
's
representative
--
the
man
who
rule
that
country
--
fear
me
,
and
for
that
reason
do
not
hold
me
prisoner
.
<EOS>
yet
when
I
recall
that
evil
look
of
revenge
on
my
departure
,
I
could
not
help
certain
feeling
of
grave
apprehension
arise
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
return
to
my
hotel
,
I
smoke
a
cigar
in
my
room
and
ponder
.
<EOS>
where
be
Elma
?
<EOS>
be
the
chief
question
which
arise
within
my
mind
.
<EOS>
by
remain
in
Helsingfors
I
could
achieve
nothing
further
,
now
that
I
have
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
oppressor
,
whereas
if
I
return
to
Abo
<EOS>
I
may
perchance
be
able
to
obtain
some
clue
to
my
love
's
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
call
her
my
love
because
I
both
pity
and
love
the
poor
afflict
girl
who
be
so
helpless
and
defenseless
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
take
the
midnight
train
back
to
Abo
,
arrive
at
the
hotel
next
morning
.
<EOS>
after
an
hour
's
rest
I
set
out
anxiously
in
search
of
Felix
,
the
drosky
-
driver
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
in
his
log
-
build
house
in
the
Ludno
quarter
,
and
when
he
ask
me
in
<EOS>
I
see
,
from
his
face
,
that
he
have
news
to
impart
.
 
<EOS>
"

I
inquire

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
It
be
a

he
say
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

I

<EOS>
They

together
at

Restaurant

,
and
an
hour
later
leave
by
steamer

<EOS>
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"

Chief
of
Police

<EOS>
"

that

well
to

<EOS>
to

he
add
.
 
<EOS>
"

I
exclaim
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
and
he
produce
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
whereon
be
write
in
a
russian
hand
the
name--

CHAPTER
XIII
 
a
DOUBLE
game
and
its
CONSEQUENCES
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
railway
station
,
and
from
the
time
-
table
gather
that
if
I
leave
Abo
by
rail
at
noon
I
could
be
in
Petersburg
an
hour
before
noon
on
the
morrow
,
or
about
four
hour
before
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
by
which
the
silent
girl
and
her
companion
be
passenger
.
<EOS>
this
I
decide
upon
do
,
but
before
leave
I
pay
a
visit
to
my
friend
,
Boranski
,
who
,
to
my
surprise
and
delight
,
hand
me
my
wallet
with
the
Czar
's
letter
intact
,
say
that
it
have
be
find
upon
a
german
thief
who
have
be
arrest
at
the
harbor
on
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
have
,
no
doubt
,
steal
it
from
my
pocket
believe
<EOS>
I
carry
my
paper
money
in
the
flap
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
affair
of
the
english
lady
be
a
most
extraordinary
one
,
"
remark
the
Chief
of
Police
,
toy
with
his
pen
as
he
sit
at
his
big
table
.
<EOS>
"
She
seem
to
have
meet
this
Englishman
up
at
tammerfor
,
or
at
some
place
further
north
,
yet
it
be
curious
that
her
passport
should
be
in
order
even
though
she
flee
so
precipitately
from
Kajana
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
mystery
connect
with
her
disappearance
from
the
wood
-
cutter
's
hut
that
I
confess
I
can
not
fathom
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
neither
can
I
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
man
who
be
with
her
,
and
can
not
help
fear
that
he
be
her
bitter
enemy
--
that
he
be
act
in
concert
with
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
why
be
he
take
her
to
the
capital
--
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Governor
-
General
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
straight
to
Petersburg
to
ascertain
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
come
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
truth
to
tell
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
somewhat
surprised
that
you
should
have
interest
yourself
on
my
behalf
,
"
I
add
,
look
straight
at
the
uniformed
official
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
on
yours
,
but
on
her
,
"
he
answer
,
somewhat
enigmatically
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
something
of
the
affair
,
but
it
be
my
duty
as
a
man
to
help
the
poor
girl
to
escape
from
that
terrible
place
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
I
know
,
be
unjustly
condemn
for
the
attempt
assassination
of
the
wife
of
a
General
--
condemn
with
a
purpose
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
such
a
thing
be
not
unusual
in
Finland
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
abominable
!
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
Oberg
be
a
veritable
fiend
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
man
only
shrug
his
shoulder
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
the
order
of
his
Excellency
the
Governor
-
General
have
to
be
obey
,
whatever
they
be
.
<EOS>
We
often
regret
,
but
we
dare
not
refuse
to
carry
them
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
russian
rule
be
a
disgrace
to
our
modern
civilization
,
"
I
declare
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
every
sympathy
with
those
who
be
fight
for
freedom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
be
not
alone
in
that
,
"
he
sigh
,
speak
in
a
low
whisper
,
and
glance
around
.
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
would
order
reform
and
ameliorate
the
condition
of
his
people
,
if
only
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
like
his
official
,
be
powerless
.
<EOS>
here
we
speak
of
the
great
uprising
with
bated
breath
,
but
we
,
alas
!
<EOS>
know
that
it
must
come
one
day
--
very
soon
--
and
Finland
will
be
the
first
to
endeavor
to
break
her
bond
--
and
the
Baron
Oberg
the
first
to
fall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
for
nearly
an
hour
I
sit
with
him
,
surprised
to
find
how
,
although
his
exterior
be
so
harsh
and
uncouth
,
yet
his
heart
really
bleed
for
the
poor
starve
people
he
be
so
constantly
force
to
oppress
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
ruin
this
town
of
Abo
,
"
he
declare
,
quite
frankly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
my
own
knowledge
five
hundred
innocent
person
have
go
to
prison
,
and
another
two
hundred
have
be
exile
to
Siberia
.
<EOS>
yet
what
I
have
do
be
only
at
direct
order
from
helsingfor
--
order
that
be
stern
,
pitiless
and
unjust
.
<EOS>
man
have
be
tear
from
their
family
and
send
to
the
mine
,
woman
have
be
arrest
for
no
offense
and
ship
off
to
Saghalien
,
and
mere
child
have
be
cast
into
prison
on
charge
of
political
conspiracy
with
their
elder
--
in
order
to
russify
the
province
!
<EOS>
only
,
"
he
add
anxiously
,
"
I
trust
you
will
never
repeat
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
ask
me
why
I
assist
the
English
Mademoiselle
to
escape
from
Kajana
,
and
I
have
explain
the
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
eat
a
hearty
meal
in
company
at
the
_
Sampalinna
_
,
a
restaurant
build
like
a
swiss
chalet
,
and
at
noon
I
enter
the
train
on
the
first
stage
of
my
slow
,
tedious
journey
through
the
great
silent
forest
and
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
of
Southern
Finland
,
by
way
of
Tavestehus
and
Viborg
,
to
Petersburg
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
alone
in
the
compartment
,
and
sit
moodily
watch
the
panorama
of
wood
and
river
as
we
slowly
wound
up
the
tortuous
ascent
and
descend
the
steep
gradient
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
even
a
newspaper
with
which
to
while
away
the
time
,
only
my
own
apprehensive
thought
of
whither
my
helpless
love
be
be
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
surely
to
no
man
be
there
ever
present
such
a
complicated
problem
as
that
which
I
be
now
try
so
vigorously
to
solve
.
<EOS>
I
love
Elma
Heath
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
reflect
,
the
deep
do
her
sweet
countenance
and
tender
grace
impress
themselves
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
,
therefore
I
be
strive
to
overtake
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
steamer
,
I
learn
,
would
call
at
Hango
and
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
Would
they
,
I
wonder
,
disembark
at
either
of
those
place
?
<EOS>
be
the
man
whom
I
have
know
as
Hornby
,
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
take
her
to
place
her
again
in
the
fiendish
hand
of
Xavier
Oberg
?
<EOS>
the
very
thought
of
it
cause
me
to
hold
my
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Daylight
come
at
last
,
cold
and
gray
,
over
those
dreary
interminable
marsh
where
game
,
especially
snipe
,
seem
abundant
,
and
at
a
small
station
at
the
head
of
a
lake
call
Davidstadt
<EOS>
I
take
my
morning
glass
of
tea
;
then
we
resume
our
journey
down
to
Viborg
,
where
a
short
,
thick
-
set
Russian
of
the
commercial
class
,
but
something
of
a
dandy
,
enter
my
compartment
,
and
we
leave
express
for
Petersburg
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
pass
by
a
small
station
call
Galitsina
,
near
which
be
many
villas
occupy
in
summer
by
family
from
Petersburg
,
and
be
travel
through
the
dense
gloomy
pine
-
wood
,
when
my
fellow
-
traveler
,
have
ask
permission
to
smoke
,
commence
to
chat
affably
.
<EOS>
He
seem
a
pleasant
fellow
,
and
tell
me
that
he
be
a
wool
merchant
,
and
that
he
have
be
have
a
pleasant
vacation
trout
fish
in
the
Vuoski
above
the
fall
of
the
Imatra
,
where
the
pool
between
the
rapid
abound
with
fish
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
that
on
account
of
the
shore
be
so
full
of
weed
and
the
clearness
of
the
water
,
fish
from
the
bank
be
almost
an
impossibility
,
and
how
they
have
to
accustom
themselves
to
troll
from
a
boat
so
small
as
to
only
accommodate
the
rower
and
the
fisherman
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
remark
suddenly--
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
english
,
I
presume
--
possibly
from
Helsingfors
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
from
Abo
.
<EOS>
I
cross
from
Stockholm
,
and
be
go
to
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
also
.
<EOS>
I
live
in
Petersburg
,
"
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
perhaps
meet
one
day
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
the
capital
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
explain
that
I
have
visit
it
once
before
,
and
have
do
the
usual
round
of
sight
-
seeing
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
brisk
and
to
the
point
,
as
become
a
man
of
business
,
but
when
we
stop
at
Bele
-
Ostrof
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
small
wind
river
that
separate
Finland
from
Russia
proper
,
the
Customs
officer
who
come
to
examine
our
baggage
exchange
a
curious
meaning
look
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellow
-
traveler
believe
that
I
have
not
observe
,
yet
,
keenly
on
the
alert
as
I
now
be
,
I
be
shrewd
to
detect
the
least
sign
or
look
,
and
I
at
once
resolve
to
tell
the
fellow
nothing
further
of
my
own
affair
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
no
doubt
,
a
spy
of
"
the
Strangler
's
,
"
who
have
follow
me
all
the
way
from
Abo
,
and
have
only
enter
my
carriage
for
the
final
stage
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
this
revelation
cause
me
some
uneasiness
,
for
even
though
I
be
able
to
evade
the
man
on
arrival
in
Petersburg
,
he
could
no
doubt
quickly
obtain
news
of
my
whereabouts
from
the
police
to
whom
my
passport
must
be
send
.
<EOS>
I
pretend
to
doze
,
and
lie
back
with
my
eye
half
-
closed
watch
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
me
disinclined
to
talk
further
,
he
take
up
the
paper
he
have
buy
and
<EOS>
become
engrossed
in
it
,
while
I
,
on
my
part
,
endeavor
to
form
some
plan
by
which
to
mislead
and
escape
his
vigilance
.
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
mean
mischief
--
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
if
Elma
be
fly
in
secret
and
he
watch
me
,
he
would
know
that
she
be
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
at
all
hazard
,
for
my
love
's
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
,
I
see
that
I
must
escape
him
.
<EOS>
the
ingeniousness
and
cleverness
of
Oberg
's
spy
be
proverbial
throughout
Finland
,
therefore
he
may
not
be
alone
,
or
in
any
case
,
on
arrival
in
Petersburg
would
obtain
assistance
in
keep
observation
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
Baron
desire
my
death
,
and
that
therefore
I
could
not
be
too
wary
of
pitfall
.
<EOS>
that
fatal
chair
so
cunningly
prepared
for
me
in
Lambeth
be
still
vividly
within
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
pass
Lanskaya
,
and
run
through
the
outer
suburb
of
Petersburg
,
my
fellow
-
traveler
become
inquisitive
as
to
where
I
be
go
,
but
I
be
somewhat
unresponsive
,
and
busy
myself
with
my
bag
until
we
enter
the
great
echo
<EOS>
terminus
whence
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
Neva
gleam
in
the
pale
sunlight
and
the
city
beyond
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
make
no
attempt
to
follow
me
--
he
be
too
clever
a
secret
agent
for
that
.
<EOS>
He
merely
wish
me
"
_
sdravstvuite
_
"
raise
his
hat
politely
and
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
a
porter
carry
my
bag
out
of
the
station
,
and
I
drive
across
the
bridge
to
the
large
hotel
where
I
have
stop
before
,
the
Europe
,
on
the
corner
of
the
Nevski
Prospect
and
the
Michael
Street
.
<EOS>
there
I
engage
a
front
room
look
down
into
the
broad
Nevski
,
have
a
wash
,
and
then
watch
at
the
window
for
the
appearance
of
the
spy
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
a
good
four
hour
before
the
steamer
from
Abo
be
due
,
and
I
intend
to
satisfy
myself
whether
or
not
I
be
be
follow
.
 
<EOS>
within
twenty
minute
the
fellow
lounge
along
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
just
as
I
have
expect
.
<EOS>
He
have
change
his
clothe
,
and
present
such
a
different
appearance
that
at
first
sight
I
fail
to
recognize
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
I
have
drive
there
,
and
intend
to
follow
me
if
I
come
forth
.
<EOS>
My
position
be
one
of
extreme
difficulty
,
for
if
I
go
down
to
the
quay
he
would
most
certainly
follow
me
.
 
<EOS>
have
watch
his
movement
for
ten
minute
or
<EOS>
so
I
descend
to
the
big
_
salle
-
a
-
manger
_
and
there
eat
my
luncheon
,
chat
to
the
french
waiter
the
while
.
<EOS>
I
sit
purposely
in
an
alcove
,
so
as
to
be
away
from
the
other
people
lunch
there
,
and
in
order
that
I
may
be
able
to
talk
with
the
waiter
without
be
overhear
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
finish
my
meal
,
and
he
be
hand
me
my
bill
,
I
bend
towards
him
and
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
earn
twenty
rouble
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
m'sieur
,
"
he
answer
,
look
at
me
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
be
acceptable
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
want
to
escape
from
this
place
without
be
observe
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
disagreeable
little
matter
regard
a
lady
,
and
I
fear
a
fracas
with
a
man
who
be
await
me
outside
in
the
Nevski
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
see
that
he
hesitate
,
I
assure
him
that
I
have
commit
no
crime
,
and
that
I
should
return
for
my
baggage
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
pass
through
the
kitchen
and
out
by
the
servant
'
entrance
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
m'sieur
so
desire
,
I
will
conduct
him
out
.
<EOS>
the
exit
be
in
a
back
street
which
lead
on
to
the
Catherine
Canal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
excellent
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
say
nothing
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
a
word
,
m'sieur
,
"
and
he
gather
up
the
note
plus
twenty
rouble
with
which
I
pay
my
bill
,
and
take
my
hat
<EOS>
I
follow
him
to
the
end
of
the
_
salle
-
a
-
manger
_
behind
a
high
wooden
screen
,
across
the
huge
kitchen
,
and
then
through
a
long
stone
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
sit
a
gruff
old
doorkeeper
.
<EOS>
My
guide
speak
a
word
to
him
,
and
then
the
door
open
and
I
find
myself
in
a
narrow
back
slum
with
the
canal
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
visit
be
to
a
clothier
's
,
where
I
purchase
and
put
on
a
new
light
overcoat
and
then
to
a
hatter
's
for
a
hat
of
different
shape
to
that
I
be
wear
.
<EOS>
I
carry
the
hat
back
to
a
quiet
alley
which
I
have
notice
,
and
quickly
exchange
the
one
I
be
wear
for
it
,
leave
my
old
hat
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
then
I
enter
a
_
cafe
_
in
order
to
while
away
the
hour
until
the
vessel
from
Finland
be
due
.
 
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
I
be
out
upon
the
quay
,
strain
my
eye
seaward
for
any
sign
of
smoke
,
but
could
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
sink
,
and
the
broad
expanse
of
water
westward
dance
like
liquid
gold
.
<EOS>
the
light
die
out
slowly
,
the
cold
gray
of
evening
creep
on
.
<EOS>
a
chill
wind
spring
up
and
sweep
the
quay
,
cause
me
to
shiver
.
<EOS>
I
ask
of
a
dock
laborer
whether
the
steamer
be
usually
late
,
whereupon
he
tell
me
that
it
be
often
five
or
six
hour
behind
time
,
depend
upon
the
delay
at
Helsingfors
.
 
<EOS>
twilight
deepen
into
night
,
and
the
rain
fall
heavily
,
yet
I
still
pace
the
wet
flag
in
patience
,
<EOS>
my
eye
ever
seaward
for
the
light
of
the
vessel
which
I
hope
bear
my
love
.
<EOS>
My
presence
there
arouse
some
speculation
among
the
lounger
,
I
think
;
nevertheless
,
I
wait
in
deep
anxiety
whether
,
after
all
,
Elma
and
Hornby
have
not
disembark
at
Helsingfors
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
ten
o'clock
a
light
shine
afar
off
,
and
the
movement
of
the
police
and
porter
on
the
quay
tell
me
that
it
be
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
then
after
a
further
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
it
come
,
amid
great
shouting
and
mutual
imprecation
,
slowly
alongside
the
quay
,
and
the
passenger
at
last
begin
to
disembark
in
the
pelting
rain
.
 
<EOS>
one
after
another
they
walk
up
the
gangway
,
file
into
the
passport
-
office
and
on
into
the
Custom
House
,
people
of
all
sort
and
all
grade
--
Swedes
,
Germans
,
Finns
,
and
Russians
--
<EOS>
until
suddenly
I
catch
sight
of
two
figure
--
one
a
man
in
a
big
tweed
travel
-
coat
and
a
golf
-
cap
,
and
the
other
the
slight
figure
of
a
woman
in
a
long
dark
cloak
and
a
woolen
tam
-
o'-shanter
.
<EOS>
the
electric
ray
fall
upon
them
as
they
come
up
the
wet
gangway
together
,
and
there
once
again
I
see
the
sweet
face
of
the
silent
woman
whom
I
have
grow
to
love
with
such
fervent
desperation
.
<EOS>
the
man
behind
her
be
the
same
who
have
entertain
me
on
board
the
_
lola_--the
man
who
be
say
to
be
the
lover
of
the
fugitive
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
 
<EOS>
without
betray
my
presence
I
watch
them
pass
through
the
passport
-
office
and
Custom
House
,
and
then
,
overhear
the
address
which
Martin
Woodroffe
give
the
_
isvoshtchik
_
<EOS>
,
I
stand
aside
,
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
see
them
drive
away
.
 
<EOS>
at
eleven
o'clock
on
the
follow
day
I
find
myself
instal
in
the
Hotel
de
Paris
,
a
comfortable
hostelry
in
the
Little
Morskaya
,
have
succeed
in
evade
the
vigilance
of
the
spy
who
have
so
cleverly
follow
me
from
Abo
,
and
in
get
my
suit
-
case
round
from
the
Hotel
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
beneath
the
same
roof
as
Elma
,
although
she
be
in
ignorance
of
my
presence
.
<EOS>
anxious
to
communicate
with
her
without
Woodroffe
's
knowledge
,
I
be
now
await
my
opportunity
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
it
appear
,
take
for
her
a
pleasant
front
room
with
sitting
-
room
adjoin
on
the
first
floor
,
while
he
himself
occupy
a
room
on
the
third
floor
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
he
have
engage
for
her
be
the
most
expensive
in
the
hotel
,
and
as
far
as
I
could
gather
from
the
french
waiter
whom
I
judiciously
tip
,
he
appear
to
treat
her
with
every
consideration
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
poor
young
lady
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
man
exclaim
as
he
stand
in
my
room
answer
my
question
,
"
what
an
affliction
!
<EOS>
She
write
down
all
her
order
--
for
she
can
utter
no
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
the
Englishman
receive
any
visitor
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
man
--
a
Russian
--
an
official
of
police
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
receive
anyone
else
,
let
me
know
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
want
you
to
give
Mademoiselle
a
letter
from
me
in
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bien
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turn
to
the
little
writing
-
table
and
scribble
a
few
hasty
line
to
my
love
,
announce
my
presence
,
and
ask
her
to
grant
me
an
interview
in
secret
as
soon
as
Woodroffe
be
absent
.
<EOS>
I
also
warn
her
of
the
search
for
her
instigate
by
the
Baron
,
and
urge
her
to
send
me
a
line
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
the
note
be
deliver
into
her
hand
,
but
although
I
wait
in
suspense
nearly
all
day
she
send
no
reply
.
<EOS>
while
Woodroffe
be
in
the
hotel
I
dare
not
show
myself
lest
he
should
recognize
me
,
therefore
I
be
compel
to
sham
indisposition
and
to
eat
my
meal
alone
in
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
both
the
mean
by
which
she
have
meet
Martin
Woodroffe
and
the
motive
be
equally
an
enigma
.
<EOS>
by
that
letter
she
have
write
to
her
schoolfellow
<EOS>
it
be
apparent
that
she
have
some
secret
of
his
,
<EOS>
for
have
she
not
wish
to
send
him
a
message
of
reassurance
that
she
have
divulge
nothing
?
<EOS>
this
would
seem
that
they
be
close
friend
;
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
something
seem
to
tell
me
that
he
be
act
falsely
,
and
be
really
an
ally
of
the
Baron
's
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
bring
her
to
Petersburg
?
<EOS>
if
he
have
desire
to
rescue
her
he
would
have
take
her
in
the
opposite
direction
--
to
Stockholm
,
where
she
would
be
free
--
whereas
he
take
her
,
an
escaped
prisoner
,
into
the
very
midst
of
peril
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
her
passport
be
in
order
,
yet
I
remember
that
an
order
have
be
issue
for
her
transportation
to
Saghalien
,
and
now
once
arrest
she
must
be
lose
to
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
this
thought
fill
me
with
fierce
anxiety
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
Petersburg
,
that
city
where
police
spy
swarm
,
and
where
every
fresh
arrival
be
note
and
his
antecedent
inquire
into
.
<EOS>
no
attempt
have
be
make
to
disguise
who
she
be
,
therefore
before
long
the
police
would
undoubtedly
come
and
arrest
her
as
the
escape
criminal
from
Kajana
.
 
<EOS>
for
several
hour
I
sit
at
my
window
watch
the
life
and
movement
down
in
the
street
below
,
my
mind
full
of
wonder
and
dark
foreboding
.
<EOS>
be
Martin
Woodroffe
play
her
false
?
 
<EOS>
just
after
half
-
past
six
o'clock
the
waiter
enter
,
and
hand
me
a
note
on
a
salver
,
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
have
,
I
believe
,
only
this
moment
be
able
to
write
in
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tear
it
open
and
read
as
follows:--
 
DEAR
FRIEND.--_I
be
so
surprised
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
be
still
in
Abo
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
have
an
appointment
at
eight
o'clock
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
,
therefore
come
to
me
at
8.15
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
you
,
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
peril_.--elma
HEATH
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
be
in
peril
!
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
I
have
fear
.
<EOS>
I
thank
Providence
that
I
have
be
send
to
help
her
and
extricate
her
from
that
awful
fate
to
which
"
the
Strangler
of
Finland
"
have
consign
her
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
hour
she
name
,
after
the
waiter
have
come
to
me
and
announce
the
Englishman
's
departure
<EOS>
,
I
descend
to
her
sit
-
room
and
enter
without
rapping
,
for
if
I
have
rap
she
could
not
,
alas
!
<EOS>
have
hear
.
 
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
spacious
and
comfortable
,
thickly
carpet
,
with
heavy
furniture
and
gilding
.
<EOS>
before
the
long
window
be
draw
curtain
of
dark
green
plush
,
and
on
one
side
be
the
high
stove
of
white
porcelain
with
shine
brass
band
,
while
from
her
low
lounge
-
chair
a
slim
wan
figure
spring
up
quickly
and
come
forward
to
greet
me
,
hold
out
both
her
hand
and
smile
happily
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
her
hand
in
mine
and
hold
them
tightly
in
silence
for
some
moment
,
as
I
look
earnestly
into
those
wonderfully
brilliant
eye
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
turn
away
laughing
,
a
slight
flush
rise
to
her
cheek
in
her
confusion
.
<EOS>
then
she
lead
me
to
a
chair
,
and
motion
me
to
be
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Ours
be
a
silent
meeting
,
but
her
gesture
and
the
expression
of
her
eye
be
surely
more
eloquent
than
mere
word
.
<EOS>
I
know
well
what
pleasure
that
re
-
encounter
cause
her
--
equal
pleasure
with
that
it
give
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
until
that
moment
I
have
never
really
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
admire
and
flirt
with
woman
.
<EOS>
what
man
have
not
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
admire
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
but
never
until
now
have
I
experience
in
my
heart
the
real
flame
of
true
burn
affection
.
<EOS>
the
sweetness
of
her
expression
,
the
tender
caress
of
those
soft
,
taper
hand
,
the
deep
mysterious
look
in
those
magnificent
eye
,
and
the
incomparable
grace
of
all
her
movement
,
combine
to
render
her
the
most
perfect
woman
I
have
ever
meet
--
perfect
in
all
,
alas
!
<EOS>
save
speech
and
hearing
,
of
which
,
with
such
dastard
wantonness
,
she
have
be
deprive
.
 
<EOS>
She
touch
her
red
lip
with
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
,
open
her
hand
,
and
shrug
her
shoulder
with
a
sad
gesture
of
regret
.
<EOS>
then
turn
quickly
to
some
paper
on
the
little
table
at
her
side
she
write
something
with
a
gold
pencil
and
hand
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
read--
 
<EOS>
"
surely
Providence
have
send
you
here
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodroffe
must
have
follow
you
from
England
.
<EOS>
He
be
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
me
from
here
and
hide
me

<EOS>
They
intend
to
send
me
into
exile
.
<EOS>
have
you
ever
be
in
Petersburg
before
?
<EOS>
do
you
know
anyone
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
when
I
have
read
,
she
hand
me
her
pencil
and
below
I
<EOS>
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
good
,
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
once
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
not
good
that
we
should
escape
at
once
from
Russia

"
 
<EOS>
"
impossible
at
present
,
"
she
write
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
both
be
arrest
at
the
frontier
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
good
to
go
into
hiding
here
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Woodroffe
to
be
my
friend
,
but
I
have
find
only
this
day
that
he
be
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
I
be
in
Kajana
,
and
be
in
Abo
when
he
learn
of
my
escape
.
<EOS>
He
go
with
two
other
man
in
search
of
us
,
and
discover
us
that
night
when
we
seek
shelter
at
the
wood
-
cutter
's
hut
.
<EOS>
without
make
his
presence
know
he
wait
outside
until
you
be
asleep
,
and
then
he
come
and
look
in
at
my
window
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
be
alarm
,
but
quickly
I
see
that
he
be
a
friend
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
the
police
be
in
the
vicinity
and
intend
to
raid
the
hut
,
therefore
I
flee
with
him
,
first
down
to
Tammerfors
and
then
to
Abo
,
and
on
here
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
I
do
not
see
the
dastardly
trap
he
have
lay
in
order
to
get
me
out
of
the
Baron
's
clutch
and
wre
from
me
my
secret
.
<EOS>
if
I
confess
,
he
intend
to
give
me
up
to
the
police
,
who
will
send
me
to
the
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
your
secret
concern
him
?
"
I
ask
in
writing
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
write
in
response
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
equally
in
his
interest
as
well
as
those
of
Baron
Oberg
if
I
be
send
to
Saghalien
and
my
identity
efface
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
russian
subject
,
as
I
have
already
tell
you

therefore
with
a
ministerial
order
against
me
I
be
in
deadly
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
trust
in
me

I
scribble
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
act
upon
any
suggestion
you
make

have
you
any
female

you

you

this
danger
be
past

"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
friend
--
a
true
friend

<EOS>
Will
you
take
a
note
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
she
write
,
to
which
I
instantly
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
then
rise
,
she
obtain
some
ink
and
pen
and
write
a
letter
,
the
content
of
which
she
do
not
show
me
before
she
seal
it
.
<EOS>
I
sit
watch
her
beautiful
head
bent
beneath
the
shaded
lamplight
,
catch
her
profile
and
notice
how
eminently
handsome
it
be
,
superb
and
unblemishe
in
her
youthful
womanhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
watch
her
write
the
superscription
upon
the
envelope
:

<EOS>
I
assure
her
I
would
not
lose
a
single
instant
,
and
five
minute
later
I
be
tear
down
the
Morskaya
in
a
drosky
along
the
canal

across
the
Nicholas
Bridge

somewhat
small

clean

shave

servant
open
the
door

in

<EOS>
thereupon
,
without
further
word
,
the
man
admit
me
into
the
long
,
dark
hall
and
close
the
door
with
an
apology
that
the
gas
be
not
light

<EOS>
but
strike
a
match
he
lead
me
up
the
broad
staircase
and
into
a
small
,
cosy
,
well

furnish
room
on
the
second
floor

evidently
the
sitting

room

some
studious

about
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
I
wait
there
,
until
the
door
reopen
,
and
there
enter
a
man
of
medium
height
,
with
a
shock
of
long
snow
-
white
hair
and
almost
patriarchal
beard
,
whose
dark
eye
that
age
have
dim
flash
out
at
me
with
a
look
of
curious
inquiry
,
and
whose
movement
be
those
of
a
person
not
quite
at
his
ease

<EOS>
"
I
have
call
on

and
take
the
letter
he
open
it
and
read
it
through

<EOS>
I
see
by
the
expression
on
his
furrowed
face
that
its
content
cause
him
the
utmost
consternation

His
countenance
,
already
pale

in

there
shoot

I

Otto

I
stand
before

who

conspiracy
against
the
Imperial
Autocrat
,
and
yet
the
identity
of
whom
the
police
have
always
fail
to
discover
.
<EOS>
It
be
believe
that
Kampf
have
once
be
professor
of
chemistry
at
Moscow
University
,
and
that
he
have
invent
that
most
terrible

the

at

word
one
day
the

would
rise

destroy

<EOS>
the
Emperor

the

INQUISITIVE
  
<EOS>
instantly
the
danger
be
apparent
,
and
instead
of
drive
back
to
the
hotel
,
I
call
out
to
the
man
to
take
me
to
the
Moscow
railway
station
,
in
order
to
put
the
spy
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
follow
me
,
but
as
he
be
on
foot
,
with
no
drosky
in
sight
,
I
should
be
able
to
reach
the
station
before
he
could
,
and
there
elude
him
.
 
<EOS>
over
the
stone
we
rattle
,
leave
the
lurk
agent
stand
in
the
deep
shadow
,
but
on
turn
back
I
see
him
dash
across
the
road
to
a
by
-
street
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
he
have
a
conveyance
in
wait
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
we
have
cross
the
Neva
,
I
countermand
my
order
to
the
man
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
go
right
up

the
station

turn
into
the
Liteinoi
Prospect

pay
double
fare

<EOS>
He
whip
his
horse
,
and
we
turn
into
that
maze
of
dark
,
ill
-
light
,
narrow
street
that
lie
between
the
Vosnesenski
and
the
Nevski
,
turn
and
wind
until
we
emerge
at
last
into
the
main
thoroughfare
again
,
and
then
at
last
we
turn
into
the
street
I
have
indicate
--
a
wide
road
of
handsome
building
where
I
know
I
be
certain
to
be
able
to
instantly
get
another
drosky
.
<EOS>
I
fling
the
man
his
money
,
alight
,
and
two
minute
later
be
drive
on
towards
the
Alexander
Bridge
,
travel
in
a
circle
back
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
time
after
time
I
glance
behind
,
but
see
nothing
of
the
Baron
's
spy
,
who
have
evidently
go
to
the
station
with
all
speed
,
expect
that
I
be
leave
the
capital
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
Elma
in
her
room
,
ready
dress
to
go
out
,
wear
a
long
traveling
-
cloak
,
and
in
her
hand
be
a
small
dressing

case
.

She
be
pale
and
full
of
anxiety
until
I
show
her
the
slip
of
paper
which
Otto
Kampf
have
give
me
with
the
address
write
upon
it
,
and
then
together
we
hurry
forth
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
to
which
we

we
discover
,
a
large
one
face
the
Fontanka
Canal

one
of
the
good
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
on
descend
<EOS>
I
ask
the
liveried
_
dvornick

for
Madame
Zurloff
,
the
name
which
the
"

have
write
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

Zurloff

remark
the

through
his
red
beard
.
<EOS>
"
whom
shall
I
say
desire
to
see
her
?

take

He

the
wide
carpet

the
statuary

us
that

and
when

minute
later

,
he
conduct
us
upstairs
to
a
fine
gild
salon
,
where
an
elderly
gray
-
haired
lady
in
black
stand
gravely
to
receive
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
allow
me
to
present
Mademoiselle
Elma
Heath
,
Princess

"
I
say
,
speak
in
French
and
bow
,
and
afterwards
tell
her
my
own
name
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hostess
welcome
my
love
in
a
graceful
speech
,
but
I
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle

a
terrible
affliction

<EOS>
She

deaf

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
she
exclaim
sympathetically
.
"
<EOS>
poor

<EOS>
poor

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
she
place
her
hand
tenderly
upon
Elma
's
shoulder
and
look
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
me
,
she
say
:
"
so
the
Red
Priest

you
both

You

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
only
ask
sanctuary
for
Mademoiselle

be
my
reply

"
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
have
no
fear

<EOS>
I

She

"
<EOS>

<EOS>
we
have
all

sufficient
of
the
horror
of

why

his

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
Princess
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
may
I
take
it
,
m'sieur

that
the
reason
you

her
be
because
you
love
her

<EOS>
pardon
me
for
suggest
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
guess
correctly

"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
then
,
know
that
Elma
could
not
hear
,
I
add
:
"
I
love
her
,
but
we
be
not
lover

<EOS>
I
have
not

her
of
my
affection

<EOS>
Hers
be
a
long
and
strange
story
,
and
she
will
perhaps
tell
you
something
of
it
in
writing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well

"
exclaim
the
gray
-
haired
lady
smiling
,
lead
my
love
across
the
luxurious
room
<EOS>
,
the
atmosphere
of
which
be
fill
with
the
scent
of
flower

take
off

I

I
say
gratefully
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Heath
be
the
victim
of
a
vile
and
dastardly
conspiracy

<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
that
she
have
be
afflict
as

by
her
enemy

that
an
operation

you

readily
see
in

deadly

"

have
her

<EOS>
horrible

<EOS>
"
She
will
perhaps
tell
you
of
the
strange
romance
that
surround
her

a
mystery
which
I
have
not
yet
be
able
to
fathom

She
be
a

Baron
Oberg
himself

I

her
bad
and
most
bitter
enemy

the
Strangler
!

"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
with
a
quick
flash
in

his
end
be
near

<EOS>
the
Movement
be
active
in
Helsingfors

<EOS>
at
any
moment
now
we
may
strike
our
blow
for
freedom
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
an
enthusiastic
revolutionist
<EOS>
,
I
could
see
,
unsuspected
,
however
,
by
the
police
on
account
of
her
high
position
in
Petersburg
society
.
<EOS>
It
be
she
who
,
as
I
afterwards
discover
,
have
furnish
the
large
sum
of
money
to
Kampf
for
the
continuation
of
the
revolutionary
propaganda
,
and
indeed
secretly
devote
the
great
part
of
her
revenue
from
her
vast
estate
in
Samara
and
Kazan
to
the
Nihilist
cause
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
himself
an
enthusiast
of
freedom
,
although
of
the
high
nobility
,
have
be
kill
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
six
year
before
,
and
since
that
time
she
have
retire
from
society
and
live
there
quietly
,
make
the
revolutionary
movement
her
sole
occupation
.
<EOS>
the
authority
believe
that
her
retirement
be
due
to
the
painful
loss
she
have
sustain
,
and
have
no
suspicion
that
it
be
her
money
that
enable
the
mysterious
"
Red
Priest
"
to
slowly
but
surely
complete
the
plot
for
the
general
uprising
.
 
<EOS>
She
compel
me
to
remove
my
coat
,
and
tea
be
serve
by
a
Tartar
footman
,
whose
family
she
explain
<EOS>
have
be
serf
of
the
Zurloffs
for
three
century
,
and
then
Elma
exchange
confidence
with
her
by
mean
of
paper
and
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
this
man
Martin
Woodroffe
,
of
whom
she
speak
?

"
ask
the
Princess
presently
,
turn
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
meet
him
twice
--
only
twice
,
"
<EOS>
I
reply
,
"
and
under
strange
circumstance

"
<EOS>
then
,
continue
,
I
tell
her
something
concern
the
incident
of
the
yacht
_
Lola

He
may
be
in
love

she
suggest
,
express
amazement
at
the
curious
narrative
I
have
relate
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
for
several
reason

<EOS>
one
be
because
I
know
she
hold
some
secret
concern
him
,
and
another
because
he
be
engage

an
english
girl
name
Muriel
Leithcourt

"
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
Leithcourt

repeat
the
Princess
,
knit
her
brow
with

quick
anxiety

<EOS>
He
rent
a
shoot
call
Rannoch

near
dumfrie

<EOS>
a
mysterious
incident
occur
on
his
estate

a
double
murder
,
or
murder
and
suicide
;
which
be
not
quite
clear
--
but
shortly
afterwards
there
appear
one
evening
at
the
house
a
man
name
Chater
,
Hylton
Chater
,
and
the
whole

at
once
flee
and
disappear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Princess
Zurloff
sit
with
her
lip
press
close
together
,
look
straight
at
the
silent
girl
before
her
.
<EOS>
Elma
have
remove
her
hat
and
cloak
,
and
now
sit
in
a
deep
easy
chair
of
yellow
silk
,
with
the
lamplight
shine
on
her
chestnut
hair
,
settle
and
calm
as
though
already
thoroughly
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
smile
to
myself
as
I
think
of
the
chagrin
of
Woodroffe
when
he
return
to
find
his
victim
missing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Highness
evidently
know
the
Leithcourts

I
hazard
,
after
a
brief
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
of
them

be
her
unsatisfactory
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
England
sometimes

<EOS>
when

often
at

a
mysterious
incident
before

flight

it
to
me

"
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
long
white
door
of
the
handsome
salon
be
throw
open
by
the
faithful
Tartar
servitor
,
and
there
enter
a
man
whose
hair
fall
over
the
collar
of
his
heavy
overcoat
,
but
whom
,
in
an
instant
,
I
recognize
as
Otto
Kampf
.
 
<EOS>
both
Elma
and
I
spring
to
our
foot
,
while
advance
to
the
Princess
he
bend
and
gallantly
kiss
the
hand
she
hold
forth
to
him
.
<EOS>
then
he
shake
hand
with
Elma
,
and
acknowledge
my
own
greeting
,
take
off
his
coat
and
throw
it
upon
a
chair
with
the
air
of
an
accustomed
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
,
Princess

in
order

explain
to
you

.
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle

remain
here

get
out
of

<EOS>
then
,
after
some
further
conversation
,
and
after
my
well
-
beloved
have
make
sign
of
heartfelt
gratitude
to
the
man
know
from
end
to
end
of
the
russian
empire
as
"
the
Red
Priest

the
Princess
turn
to
me
,
say
:
 
"
I
would
much
like
to
know

occur
before

Scotland

<EOS>
"
the
Leithcourts

in
utter
surprise

<EOS>
"
do
you
know
the
Leithcourts
--
and
the
english
officer
Durnford
?

"
 
<EOS>
I
look
into
his
eye
in
abject
amazement
.
<EOS>
what
connection
could
Jack
Durnford
,
of
the
Marines
,
have
with
the
adventurer
Philip
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
recollect
Jack
's
word
,
when
I
have
describe
the
visit
of
the
_
Lola
_
to
Leghorn
,
and
further
I
recollect
that
very
shortly
he
would
be
back
in
London
from
his
term
of
Mediterranean
service
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
after
a
pause
,
"
I
happen
to
know
Captain
Durnford
very
well

I
have
no
idea

the
Red
Priest
smile

stroke
his
white
beard

will
tell

<EOS>
My
eye
meet
Elma
's
,
and
I
see
how
intensely
eager
and
interested
she
be
,
watch
the
movement
of
my
lip
and
try
to
make
out
what
word
I
utter
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
,
"
a
mysterious
tragedy
occur
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
near
the
house
rent
by
Leithcourt
--
a
tragedy

have
puzzle

to
this
day

up

"
<EOS>
but
surely
he
be
not
dead

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

be
the
curious
part

the
affair

the
man

kill

represent
the
Italian

<EOS>
the
Princess
and
the
director

russian
revolutionary
movement
exchange
quick
glance

<EOS>
It
be
as
though
her
Highness
implore
Kampf
to
reveal
to
me
the
truth

while
he
,
on
his
part

be
averse

do
so

far
as
I
can
make
out

spot

then
why
do

so
suddenly

appearance

man

flee

who
,
at
the

moment

take
Elma

hand
tenderly
in

look
at

turn
to

"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Princess
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
only
help
and
protect
her
,
you
will
be
do
an
act
of
mercy
to
a
defenseless
woman
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
--
I
admit
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
my
utmost
:
I
have
strive
to
solve
the
dark
mystery
,
but
up
to
the
present
I
have
be
unsuccessful
,
and
have
only
remain
,
even
till
to
-
day
,
the
victim
of
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
her
stay
with
me
,
"
the
kindly
woman
answer
,
smile
tenderly
upon
my
love
.
"
<EOS>
She
will
be
safe
here
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
endeavor
to
discover
the
real
and
actual
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
in
response
I
take
the
Princess
's
hand
and
press
it
fervently
.
<EOS>
although
that
striking
,
white
-
headed
man
and
the
rather
stiff
,
formal
woman
in
black
be
the
leader
of
the
great
and
all
-
powerful
movement
in
Russia
know
through
the
civilized
world
as
"
the
Terror
,
"
yet
they
be
nevertheless
our
friend
.
<EOS>
They
have
pledge
themselves
to
help
us
thwart
our
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
I
scribble
a
few
hasty
word
upon
paper
and
hand
it
to
Elma
.
<EOS>
and
for
answer
she
smile
contentedly
,
look
into
my
eye
with
an
expression
of
trust
,
devotion
and
love

CHAPTER
XV
 
<EOS>
just
off
<EOS>
the
STRAND
  
<EOS>
a
week
have
go
by
.
<EOS>
the
Nord
Express
have
bring
me
posthaste
across
Europe
from
Petersburg
to
Calais
,
and
I
be
again
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
leave
Elma
in
the
care
of
the
Princess
Zurloff
,
whom
I
know
would
conceal
her
from
the
horde
of
police
-
agent
now
in
search
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
mystery
have
so
increase
until
now
it
have
become
absolutely
bewildering
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
have
try
to
probe
it
,
the
more
inexplicable
have
I
find
it
.
<EOS>
My
brain
be
awhirl
as
I
sit
in
the
_
wagon
-
lit
_
rush
across
those
wide
,
never
-
end
plain
<EOS>
that
lie
between
the
russian
capital
and
Berlin
and
the
green
valley
between
the
Rhine
-
land
and
the
sea
.
<EOS>
the
maze
of
mystery
render
me
utterly
incapable
of
grasp
one
solid
tangible
fact
,
so
closely
interwoven
be
each
incident
of
the
strange
life
-
drama
in
which
,
through
mere
chance
,
I
be
now
play
a
lead
part
.
<EOS>
I
be
aware
of
one
fact
only
,
that
I
love
Elma
with
all
my
soul
,
even
though
I
know
not
whom
she
really
be
--
or
her
strange
life
story
.
<EOS>
Her
sweet
face
,
with
those
soft
,
brown
eye
,
so
tender
and
intense
,
stand
out
ever
before
me
,
sleep
or
waking
.
<EOS>
each
moment
as
the
express
rush
south
increase
the
distance
between
us
,
yet
be
I
not
on
my
way
back
to
England
with
a
clear
and
distinct
purpose
?
<EOS>
I
snatch
at
any
clue
,
however
small
,
with
desperate
eagerness
,
as
a
drown
man
clutch
at
a
straw
.
 
<EOS>
the
spy
from
Abo
have
see
me
on
the
railway
platform
on
my
departure
from
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
He
have
overhear
me
buy
a
ticket
for
London
,
and
previous
to
step
into
the
train
I
have
smile
at
him
in
glad
triumph
.
<EOS>
My
journey
be
too
long
a
one
for
him
to
follow
,
and
I
know
that
I
have
at
last
outwit
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
to
see
Elma
with
me
,
no
doubt
,
and
his
disappointment
be
plainly
mark
.
<EOS>
but
of
Woodroffe
I
have
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
.

It
be
a
cold
but
dry
November
night
in
London
,
and
I
sit
dine
with
Jack
Durnford
at
a
small
table
in
the
big
,
well
-
light
room
of
the
Junior
United
Service
Club
.
<EOS>
easy
-
go
and
merry
as
of
old
,
my
friend
be
bubble
over
with
good
spirit
,
delighted
to
be
back
again
in
town
after
three
year
sail
up
and
down
the
Mediterranean
,
from
Gib
.
<EOS>
to
Smyrna
,
maneuver
always
,
yet
with
never
a
chance
of
a
fight
.
<EOS>
His
well
-
shave
face
bear
the
mark
of
the
southern
suns
,
and
the
back
of
his
hand
be
tan
by
the
heat
and
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
as
smart
an
officer
as
any
at
the
Junior
,
for
the
Marines
be
proverbial
for
their
neatness
,
and
his
man
on
board
the
_
Bulwark
_
have
receive
many
a
pleasing
compliment
from
the
Admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
glad
to
be
back
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
as
he
help
himself
to
a
"
peg
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
think
so
,
old
chap
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
awfully
weary
the
life
become
out
there
.
<EOS>
lot
go
on
down
at
Palermo
,
Malta
,
Monte
Carlo
,
or
over
at
Algiers
,
and
yet
we
can
never
get
a
chance
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
always
in
sight
of
the
gay
place
,
and
never
land
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
the
youngster
for
get
off
from
Leghorn
for
two
day
over
here
in
town
when
they
can
.
<EOS>
three
year
be
a
big
slice
out
of
a
fellow
's
life
than
anyone
would
suppose
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
the
way
,
I
see
Hutcheson
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
We
put
into
Spezia
,
and
he
come
out
to
see
the
admiral
--
get
despatch
for
him
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
seem
as
gay
as
ever
.
<EOS>
He
lunch
at
mess
,
and
say
how
sorry
he
be
you
would
desert
Leghorn
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
exactly
desert
it
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
really
do
not
love
it
like
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
a
year
or
two
of
the
Mediterranean
blue
be
quite
sufficient
to
last
any
fellow
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
live
in
Leghorn
if
I
have
my
choice
.
<EOS>
I
would
prefer
somewhere
up
in
the
mountain
,
beyond
Pisa
,
or
outside
Florence
,
where
you
can
have
a
good
time
in
winter
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
a
silence
fall
between
us
,
and
I
sit
eat
on
until
the
end
of
the
meal
,
wonder
how
to
broach
the
question
I
so
desire
to
put
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
if
I
can
get
on
recruit
service
at
home
for
a
bit
,
"
he
say
presently
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
an
appointment
up
in
Glasgow
vacant
,
and
I
shall
try
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
,
at
any
rate
,
than
China
or
the
Pacific
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
about
to
turn
the
conversation
to
the
visit
of
the
mysterious
_
Lola
_
to
Leghorn
,
when
two
man
he
know
enter
the
dining
-
room
,
and
,
recognize
him
,
come
across
to
give
him
a
welcome
home
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
newcomer
be
Major
Bartlett
,
whom
I
at
once
recollect
as
have
be
a
guest
of
Leithcourt
's
up
at
Rannoch
,
and
the
other
a
young
man
whom
Durnford
introduce
to
me
as
Captain
Hanbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Major
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
rise
and
grasp
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
see
you
since
Scotland
,
and
the
extraordinary
ending
to
your
house
-
party
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
amazing
affair
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
after
the
Leithcourts
leave
it
be
like
<EOS>
pandemonium
let
loose
;
the
guest
collar
everything
they
could
lay
their
hand
upon
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
to
me
<EOS>
the
disgraceful
affair
do
not
get
into
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
where
be
Leithcourt
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
not
the
ghost
of
an
idea
,
"
reply
the
Major
,
stand
astride
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
"
<EOS>
Young
Paget
of
our
tell
me
the
other
day
that
he
see
Muriel
drive
in
the
Terminus
Road
at
Eastbourne
,
but
she
do
not
notice
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
queerish
lot
,
those
Leithcourts
,
"
he
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
!
<EOS>
what
be
you
say
about
the
Leithcourts
,
Charley
?
"
exclaim
Durnford
,
turn
quickly
from
Hanbury
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
some
people
of
that
name
--
Philip
Leithcourt
,
who
have
a
daughter
name
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
they
sound
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
know
them
,
my
dear
old
chap
,
I
really
do
not
envy
you
your
friend
,
"
declare
the
Major
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Gregg
will
tell
you
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
know
,
perhaps
,
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
he
add
,
"
they
may
not
,
of
course
,
be
the
same
people
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
first
meet
them
yacht
over
at
Algiers
,
"
Jack
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
then
again
at
Malta
,
where
they
seem
to
have
quite
a
lot
of
friend
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
steam
-
yacht
,
the
_
Iris
_
,
and
be
often
up
and
down
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Must
be
the
same
people
,
"
declare
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
speak
once
or
twice
of
his
yacht
,
but
we
all
put
it
down
as
a
non
-
existent
vessel
,
because
he
be
always
draw
the
long
bow
about
his
adventure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
first
come
to
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
of
the
Major
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
somebody
bring
him
to
mess
,
and
we
strike
up
an
acquaintance
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
seem
a
good
chap
,
and
when
he
ask
me
to
shoot
I
accept
.
<EOS>
on
arrival
up
at
Rannoch
,
however
,
one
thing
strike
me
as
jolly
strange
,
and
that
be
that
among
the
people
I
be
ask
to
meet
<EOS>
be
one
of
the
very
bad
blackleg
about
town
.
<EOS>
He
call
himself
Martin
Woodroffe
up
there
--
although
I
would
know
him
at
the
old
Corinthian
Club
as
Dick
Archer
.
<EOS>
He
be
believe
then
to
be
one
of
a
clever
gang
of
international
thief
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
first
meet
him
he
give
me
the
name
of
Hornby
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
Leghorn
,
where
he
be
on
board
a
yacht
call
the
_
Lola
_
,
of
which
he
represent
himself
as
owner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
leave
Rannoch
very
suddenly
,
"
remark
Bartlett
.
<EOS>
"
We
understand
that
he
be
engage
to
marry
Muriel
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
I
be
sorry
for
her
,
poor
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Durnford
,
start
up
.
<EOS>
"
that
man
to
marry
Muriel
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
his
countenance
have
turn
pale
,
and
he
give
no
answer
to
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
these
same
leithcourt
be
really
friend
of
yours
,
Durnford
,
old
fellow
,
I
be
sorry
I
have
say
anything
against
them
,
"
the
Major
exclaim
in
an
apologetic
tone
.
"
<EOS>
only
the
end
of
my
visit
be
so
abrupt
and
so
extraordinary
,
and
the
company
such
a
mixed
one
,
that
--
well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
the
people
be
a
mysterious
lot
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
our
leithcourt
be
not
the
same
as
those
Jack
know
,
"
I
remark
,
in
order
to
escape
from
a
rather
difficult
situation
;
<EOS>
whereupon
Durnford
,
as
though
eager
to
conceal
his
surprise
,
say
with
a
force
laugh
,
"
oh
!
probably
not
,
"
and
reseat
himself
at
table
.
<EOS>
then
the
Major
quickly
change
the
topic
of
conversation
,
and
afterwards
he
and
his
friend
pass
along
to
their
table
and
sit
down
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
notice
that
Jack
Durnford
be
upset
at
what
he
have
learn
,
yet
I
hesitate
just
then
to
put
any
question
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
approach
the
subject
later
,
so
as
to
allow
him
time
to
question
me
if
he
wish
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
after
smoke
an
hour
we
go
across
to
the
Empire
,
where
we
spend
the
evening
in
the
grand
circle
,
meet
many
man
we
know
and
have
a
rather
pleasant
time
among
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
who
have
live
the
club
life
of
London
return
from
abroad
,
he
can
always
run
across
someone
he
know
in
the
circle
of
the
Empire
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
<EOS>
Jack
be
,
however
,
not
his
old
self
that
he
have
be
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
His
brow
be
now
heavy
and
thoughtful
,
and
he
appear
deeply
immerse
in
some
intricate
problem
,
for
his
eye
be
fix
vacantly
when
opportunity
be
afford
him
to
think
,
and
he
appear
to
desire
to
avoid
his
friend
rather
than
to
greet
them
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
theater
I
induce
him
to
come
round
to
the
Cecil
,
and
in
the
wicker
chair
in
the
big
portico
before
the
entrance
we
sit
to
smoke
our
final
cigar
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
favorite
spot
of
mine
when
in
London
,
for
at
afternoon
,
when
the
string
band
play
and
the
Americans
and
other
cosmopolitan
drink
tea
,
there
be
a
continual
come
and
go
,
<EOS>
a
little
panorama
of
life
that
to
a
student
of
man
like
myself
be
intensely
interesting
.
<EOS>
and
at
night
it
be
just
as
amusing
to
sit
there
in
the
shadow
and
watch
the
people
return
from
the
theater
or
dance
and
to
speculate
as
to
whom
and
what
they
be
.
<EOS>
at
that
one
little
corner
of
London
just
off
the
Strand
you
see
more
variety
of
man
and
woman
than
perhaps
at
any
other
spot
.
<EOS>
all
grade
pass
before
you
,
from
the
pushful
american
commercial
man
interested
in
a
patent
medicine
,
to
the
proud
Indian
Rajah
with
his
turbaned
suite
;
from
the
variety
actress
to
the
daughter
of
a
peer
,
or
the

surely
I

enough
to
cause
me
--
after

from
Bartlett

one
day

I
be

notice
in

of

the

the

I

I

find
tear
up
on

when

the

my

I
would

no

add
with
a
fierce
resolution

"
I
love

go
on
,

she
reciprocate
my
love

ours

a
secret
engagement
make
in
Malta
two
year
ago

you
tell
me
that
she

herself
to
that
fellow
Woodroffe

the
man
know
here
in
London
as
Dick
Archer

<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
it
--
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
write
to
me
as
she
have
do
,
urge
patience
and
secrecy
until
my
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
unless
,
of
course
,
she
desire
to
gain
time
,
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
friend
be
silent
;
his
brow
be
deep
knit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Woodroffe
be
at
the
present
moment
in
Petersburg

"
I
say
.

"
I
have
just
come
back
from
there
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
in
St.
Petersburg
!

he
gasp
,
surprised
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
be
with
that
villainous
official
,
Baron
Oberg
,
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland

<EOS>
"
no
;
Oberg
be
live
shut
up
in
his
palace
at
Helsingfors

fear
to
go
out
lest
he
shall
be
assassinate

"
be
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
Elma
?
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
in
hiding
in
Petersburg
,
await
such
time
as
I
can
get
her
safely
out
of
Russia
,
"
and
then
,
continue
,
I
explain
how
she
have
be
maim
and
render
deaf
and
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
have
they
actually
do
that
to
the
poor
girl
?
<EOS>
then
they
fear
that
she
should
reveal
the
nature
of
their
plot
,
for
she
have
see
and
hear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
see
and
hear
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
patient
;
we
will
elucidate
this
mystery
,
and
the
motive
of
this
terrible
infliction
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Muriel
write
to
me
say
that
poor
Elma
,
her
friend
,
have
disappear
,
and
she
fear
that
some
evil
have
also
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
so
Oberg
have
send
her
to
his
fortress
--
his
own
private
Bastille
--
the
place
to
which
,
on
pretended
charge
of
conspiracy
against
Russia
,
he
send
those
who
thwart
him
to
a
live
tomb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
him
,
and
I
have
defy
him
,
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
!
<EOS>
man
alive
!
<EOS>
be
careful
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
fellow
who
stick
at
trifle
,
"
say
Jack
warningly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
fear
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Elma
's
enemy
be
also
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
take
it
,
old
fellow
,
that
notwithstanding
her
affliction
,
you
be
actually
in
love
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
rescue
,
and
to
marry
her
,
"
I
answer
quite
frankly
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
first
we
must
tear
aside
this
veil
of
mystery
and
ascertain
all
the
fact
concern
her
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
at
present
I
only
know
one
or
two
very
vague
detail
.
<EOS>
the
baron
be
certainly
not
her
uncle
,
as
he
represent
himself
to
be
,
but
it
seem
certain
that
she
be
the
daughter
of
anglo
-
russian
parent
,
and
be
bear
in
Russia
and
bring
to
England
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
from
whom
do
you
expect
I
can
obtain
the
true
fact
concern
her
,
and
the
reason
of
the
baron
's
desire
to
keep
her
silent
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
twist
his
mustache
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
just
the
question
.
<EOS>
for
a
solution
of
the
problem
we
must
first
fathom
the
motive
of
the
Leithcourts
and
the
reason
they
flee
in
fear
before
that
fellow
Chater
.
<EOS>
that
Muriel
be
innocent
of
any
complicity
in
their
plot
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
I
feel
convinced
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
the
victim
of
that
blackleg
Woodroffe
,
who
,
as
Bartlett
have
tell
you
,
be
one
of
the
most
expert
swindler
in
London
,
and
who
have
already
do
two
term
of
penal
servitude
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
motive
in
break
open
the
Consul
's
safe
,
if
not
to
obtain
the
Foreign
Office
or
Admiralty
cipher
?
<EOS>
perhaps
they
want
to
steal
them
and
sell
them
to
a
foreign
government
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
that
be
not
their
object
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
over
it
many
,
many
time
since
you
tell
me
,
and
I
feel
convinced
that
Woodroffe
be
too
shrewd
a
fellow
not
to
have
know
that
no
Consul
go
away
on
leave
and
allow
his
cipher
to
remain
behind
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
his
post
he
always
deposit
those
precious
book
either
at
the
Foreign
Office
here
or
with
his
Consul
-
General
,
or
with
a
Consul
at
another
port
.
<EOS>
They
would
surely
ascertain
all
that
before
they
make
the
raid
,
you
bet
.
<EOS>
the
affair
be
a
risky
one
,
and
Dick
Archer
be
know
as
a
man
of
many
precaution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
on
extremely
friendly
term
with
Elma
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
succeed
in
find
her
in
Finland
,
and
take
her
beyond
Oberg
's
sphere
of
influence
to
Petersburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
certainly
only
an
affected
friendship
,
with
some
sinister
motive
underlie
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
write
a
letter
from
her
island
prison
to
an
old
schoolfellow
name
Lydia
Moreton
,
ask
her
to
see
Woodroffe
at
his
room
in
Cork
Street
,
and
tell
him
that
through
all
she
be
suffer
she
have
keep
her
promise
to
him
,
and
that
the
secret
be
still
safe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
fellow
fear
that
as
you
be
so
actively
search
out
the
truth
,
she
may
yield
to
your
demand
and
explain
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
intend
to
silence
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
to
kill
her
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
,
in
quick
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
may
do
so
,
in
order
to
save
himself
,
you
see
,
"
Jack
reply
,
add
:
"
He
certainly
would
have
no
compunction
if
he
think
that
it
would
not
be
bring
home
to
him
.
<EOS>
only
he
,
no
doubt
,
fear
you
,
because
you
have
find
her
,
and
be
in
love
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
admit
the
force
of
his
argument
,
but
recollect
that
my
dear
one
be
safe
in
concealment
,
and
that
the
Princess
be
our
friend
,
even
though
I
,
as
an
Englishman
,
have
no
sympathy
with
the
doctrine
of
the
bomb
and
the
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
get
from
him
all
that
he
know
concern
Elma
,
but
he
seem
,
for
some
curious
reason
,
disincline
to
tell
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
gather
be
that
Leithcourt
be
in
league
with
Chater
and
Woodroffe
,
and
that
Muriel
have
act
as
an
entirely
innocent
agent
.
<EOS>
what
the
conspiracy
be
,
or
what
be
its
motive
,
I
could
not
discern
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
far
off
the
solution
of
the
problem
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
first
find
Muriel
,
"
he
declare
,
when
I
press
him
to
tell
me
everything
he
know
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
fact
you
have
tell
me
which
negative
my
own
theory
,
and
only
from
her
<EOS>
can
we
obtain
the
real
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
surely
you
know
where
she
be
?
<EOS>
She
write
to
you

I
say

<EOS>
"
the
last
letter
,
which
I
receive
at

ten
day
ago

he
answer
in
a
low
voice
,
as
though
speak
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
.
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
I
be
die
,
Jack
,
to
know
everything
concern
her
.
<EOS>
who
be
that
fellow
Oberg
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
,
by
mere
accident
,
learn
his
secret
and
Woodroffe
's
,
and
they
now
both
live
in
deadly
fear
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
for
that
reason
she
be
take
to
Siena
,
where
some
villainous
italian
doctor
be
bribe
to
render
her
deaf
and
dumb
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
Chater
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
little
concern
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
conspire
with
them
,
or
he
may
be
innocent
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
he
be
antagonistic
to
their
scheme
,
if
Leithcourt
and
his
family
really
flee
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
he
be
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
may
have
help
to
commit
the
burglary
at
the
Consulate
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
quite
likely
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
but
our
first
object
must
be
to
rediscover
Muriel
.
<EOS>
Paget
say
she
be
in
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
there
,
we
shall
easily
find
her
.
<EOS>
They
publish
visitor
'
list
in
the
paper
,
do
not
they
,
like
they
do
at
Hastings
?
<EOS>
"
then
he
add
:
"
visitor
'
list
be
most
annoying
when
you
find
your
name
print
in
them
when
you
be
suppose
officially
to
be
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
be
have
once
like
that
by
the
Bournemouth
paper
,
when
I
be
suppose
to
be
on
duty
over
at
Queenstown

<EOS>
I
narrowly
escape
a
terrible
wigging

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
to
Eastbourne
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
there
with
you
in
the
morning

<EOS>
"
or
would
it
not
be
good
to
send
an
urgent
wire
to
the
address
where
I
always
write
?
<EOS>
She
would
then
reply
here
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
in
Eastbourne
,
there
may
be
reason
why
she
can
not
come
up
to
town

<EOS>
if
her
people
be
in
hiding
,
of
course
she
will
not
come
.

she
will
make
an
appointment
with
me
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
send
a
wire
,
"
I
say
.

make
it
urgent
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
be
forward

but
as
regard
Olinto
?
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
see
him
?
<EOS>
He
may
tell
you
more
than
he
have
tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
by
no
mean
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
know
that
I
have
return
to
London
,

declare
my
friend
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
not

him

you
understand

his

well
,
not
exactly
our
own
?

no

why
do
not
you
tell
me
more
about
Elma

I
urge
,
for
I
be
eager
to
learn
all
he
know

<EOS>
"
come
,
do
tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
implore
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
you
practically
everything

my

old
fellow

be
his
response
.
<EOS>
"
the
revelation
of
the
true
fact
of
the
affair
can
be
make
only
by
Muriel

tell
you

we
must
find
her

<EOS>
"
yes

we
must
--
at
all
hazard
,
"
I

.
<EOS>
"
let
's
go
across
to
the
telegraph
office
opposite
Charing
Cross
.
<EOS>
It
be
open
always
.
"
<EOS>
and
we
rise
and
walk
out
along
the
Strand
,
now
nearly
desert
,
and
despatch
an
urgent
message
to
Muriel
at
an
address
in
Hurlingham
Road
,
Fulham

<EOS>
afterwards
we
stand
outside
on
the
curb

still
talk

I
loth
to
part
from
him
,
when
there
pass
by
in
the
shadow
two
man
in
dark
overcoat
,
who
cross
the
road
behind
us
to
the
front
of
Charing
Cross
station
,
and
then
continue
on
towards
Trafalgar
Square
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
fall
upon
them
,
I
think
I
recognize
the
face
of
one
as
that
of
a
person
I
have
see
before
,
yet
I
be
not
at
all
certain
,
and
my
failure
to
remember
whom
the
passer
-
by
resemble
prevent
me
from
say
anything
further
to
Jack
than
:
 
"
a
fellow
I
know
have
just
go
by
,
I
think
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
seem

to
-
night

he
laugh
.

"
after
all
,
old
chap
,
it
do
one
good
to
come
back
to
our

,
dirty
old
town
again
.
<EOS>
We
abuse
it
when
we
be
here
,
and
talk
of
the
life
in
Paris
,
and
Vienna
,
and
Brussels

when

away
there

I
be
actually

romantic

come
in
at
ten
to

we
will
decide
upon
some
plan

<EOS>
one
thing
be
plainly
certain
;
Elma

at

get
out

She
be
in

peril

you

warmly

my

then
we
part

stroll
along
towards
the
National

CHAPTER
XVI
 
<EOS>
MARKED
<EOS>
man
  
"
Captain
Durnford
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
of
the
hall
-
porter
of
the
club
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
he
sleep
here
last
night
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
appointment
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
man
consult
the
big
book
before
him
,
and
answer
:
 
"
Captain
Durnford
go
out
at
9:27
last
night
,
sir
,
but
have
not
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
Strange
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
but
although
I
wait
in
the
club
nearly
an
hour
,
he
do
not
put
in
an
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
call
again
at
noon
,
and
he
have
not
come
in
,
and
again
at
two
o'clock
,
but
he
have
not
even
then
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
then
I
begin
to
be
anxious
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
hotel
,
resolve
to
wait
for
a
few
hour
longer
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
alter
his
mind
and
go
to
Eastbourne
in
search
of
Muriel
;
yet
,
have
he
do
so
,
he
would
surely
have
telegraph
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
about
four
o'clock
,
as
I
be
pass
through
the
big
hall
of
the
hotel
<EOS>
,
I
hear
a
voice
behind
me
utter
a
greeting
in
Italian
,
and
turn
in
surprise
,
find
<EOS>
Olinto
,
dress
in
his
good
suit
of
black
,
stand
hat
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
I
recollect
what
Jack
have
tell
me
,
and
regard
him
with
some
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Commendatore
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
as
though
fear
to
be
overhear
,
"
may
I
be
permit
to
speak
in
private
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
say
,
and
I
take
him
in
the
lift
up
to
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
warn
you
,
signore
,
"
he
say
,
when
I
have
give
him
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
enemy
mean
harm
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
they
,
pray
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
bite
my
lip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
same
,
I
suppose
,
who
prepare
that
ingenious
trap
in
Lambeth
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
here
to
reveal
to
you
who
they
be
,
signore
,
only
to
warn
you
to
have
a
care
of
yourself
,
"
be
the
Italian
's
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
Olinto
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
determinedly
,
"
I
have
have
enough
of
this
confound
mystery
.
<EOS>
tell
me
the
truth
regard
the
assassination
of
your
poor
wife
up
in
Scotland
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
signore
!
"
<EOS>
he
answer
sadly
in
a
change
voice
,
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
plot
.
<EOS>
someone
represent
me
--
but
he
be
kill
also
.
<EOS>
They
believe
they
have
strike
me
down
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Armida
's
body
be
find
conceal
behind
a
rock
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
--
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
your
wife
's
assassin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
entirely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
one
thing
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
Armida
possess
any
trinket
in
the
form
of
a
little
enamel
cross
--
like
a
miniature
cross
of
cavaliere
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
on
the
floor
at
the
Mansion
House
,
where
I
be
engage
as
odd
waiter
for
a
banquet
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
to
have
give
it
up
to
the
Lord
Mayor
's
servant
,
but
it
be
such
a
pretty
little
thing
that
I
be
tempt
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
It
probably
have
fall
from
the
coat
of
one
of
the
diplomatist
dine
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
silent
.
<EOS>
the
faint
suspicion
that
Oberg
have
be
at
that
spot
be
now
entirely
remove
.
<EOS>
the
only
clue
I
have
be
satisfactorily
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
,
Signor
Commendatore
?
"
<EOS>
he
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
the
cross
be
find
at
the
spot
,
and
be
believe
to
have
be
drop
by
the
assassin
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
the
police
have
,
it
seem
,
succeed
in
discover
the
unfortunate
woman
after
all
,
and
have
find
that
she
be
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
a
man
name
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
a
few
moment
later
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
in
this
affair
,
Olinto
,
our
interest
be
mutual
,
be
they
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
nod
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
know
also
a
man
name
Archer
--
who
be
sometimes
know
as
Hornby
,
or
Woodroffe
--
as
well
as
a
friend
of
his
call
Chater
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
Si
,
signore
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
meet
them
all
--
to
my
regret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
ever
meet
a
Russian
--
a
certain
Baron
Oberg
--
and
his
niece
,
Elma
Heath
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
niece
?
<EOS>
She
be
not
his
niece
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
who
be
she
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
once
or
twice
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
dead
,
be
not
she
?
<EOS>
She
know
the
secret
of
those
man
,
and
they
intend
to
kill
her
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
prevent
them
take
her
away
on
the
yacht
,
and
I
would
have
go
to
the
police
--
<EOS>
only
I
dare
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
because
my
own
hand
be
not
quite
clean
,
"
he
answer
after
a
pause
,
his
eye
fix
upon
mine
the
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
they
intend
to
silence
her
,
but
I
be
powerless
to
save
her
,
poor
young
lady
.
<EOS>
They
take
her
on
board
Leithcourt
's
yacht
,
the
_
Iris
_
,
and
they
sail
for
the
Mediterranean
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
the
name
and
appearance
of
the
yacht
be
alter
on
the
voyage
,

it
become
the
_
Lola
_
,

I
say
.
 
<EOS>

no

he
smile

<EOS>
the
_
Iris
_
be
a
steamer
of
many
name
,

have
,
I
believe
,
be
paint
nearly
all
the
color
of
the
rainbow
at
various
time

<EOS>
It
be
a
mysterious
vessel
,

she
exist
no
more

<EOS>
They
scuttle
her
somewhere
up
in
the
Baltic

I
have
hear
.

<EOS>
"
and
who
be
this
Oberg
?
<EOS>

I
inquire
,
urge
him
to
reveal
to
me
all
he

concern
him

<EOS>
"
He
stand
in
great
fear
of
the
poor
young
lady
,
I
believe
,
for
it
be
at
his
instigation
that
Leithcourt
and
his
friend
take
her
on
that
fatal
yacht
cruise

what
be
your
connection

well

I
be
steward
on
the

I

<EOS>
"
but
I
fear
that
they
be
far
too
wary
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Armida
have
lose
her
life
.
<EOS>
surely
that
be
sufficient
incentive
for
you
to
bring
them
all
to
justice
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
law
fall
upon
them
,
it
will
also
fall
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
explain
the
terrible
affliction
to
which
my
love
have
be
subject
by
those
heartless
brute
,
whereupon
he
cry
enthusiastically
:
 
<EOS>
"
then
she
be
not
dead
!
<EOS>
She
can
tell
us
everything
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
can
not
you
tell
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
all
.
<EOS>
the
secret
she
know
have
never
be
reveal
.
<EOS>
They
fear
she
may
be
incautious
,
and
for
that
reason
Oberg
make
the
villainous
suggestion
of
the
yacht
trip
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
be
drown
--
accidentally
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
in
St.
Petersburg
now
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
Russia
!
<EOS>
ah
,
signore
,
for
her
sake
,
do
not
allow
the
young
lady
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
the
Baron
be
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
He
do
what
he
wish
in
Russia
,
and
the
more
merciless
he
be
to
the
people
he
govern
,
<EOS>
the
great
reward
he
receive
from
the
Czar
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
in
Russia
,
but
surely
it
must
be
a
strange
country
,
signore
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
,
sit
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
look
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
prepared
to
denounce
them
if
I
bring
the
Signorina
Heath
here
,
to
England
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
use
,
if
we
have
no
clear
proof
?
"
be
his
evasive
reply
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
plainly
that
he
fear
be
himself
implicate
in
some
extraordinary
plot
,
the
exact
nature
of
which
he
so
steadfastly
refuse
to
reveal
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
on
for
fully
half
an
hour
,
and
from
his
conversation
I
gather
that
he
be
well
acquaint
with
Elma
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
signore
,
she
be
such
a
pleasant
and
kind
-
hearted
young
lady
.
<EOS>
I
always
feel
very
sorry
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
deadly
fear
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
they
be
thief
?
<EOS>
"
I
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
bad
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
they
induce
you
to
entice
me
to
that
house
in
Lambeth
?
<EOS>
why
do
they
so
evidently
desire
that
I
should
be
kill
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
accident
,
"
he
interrupt
,
correct
me
.
"
<EOS>
always
by
accident
,
"
and
he
smile
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
"
surely
you
know
their
secret
motive
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
the
time
I
do
not
,
"
he
declare
.
<EOS>
"
I
act
on
their
instruction
,
be
compel
to
,
for
they
hold
my
future
in
their
hand
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
could
not
disobey
.
<EOS>
You
know
too
much
,
therefore
you
be
mark
down
for
death
--
just
as
you
be
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
it
who
be
now
seek
my
life
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
return
from
Russia
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
movement
be
well
know
,
"
answer
the
young
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
too
careful
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
have
be
in
Russia
with
you
,
have
he
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
whereupon
he
say
:
 
"
I
think
so
,
but
be
not
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
Chater
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
;
"
where
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
and
the
leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
shrug
his
shoulder
with
a
gesture
of
ignorance
,
add
:
"
the
Signorina
Muriel
return
to
London
from
Eastbourne
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
can
I
find
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
the
utmost
importance
that
I
should
see
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
with
a
relation
,
a
cousin
,
I
think
,
at
Bassett
Road
,
Notting
Hill
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
call
'
Holmwood
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
see
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
hear
she
have
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
her
father
be
still
in
hide
from
Chater
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
still
in
hiding
,
but
Chater
be
his
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
curious
,
"
I
remark
,
recollect
the
hurry
departure
from
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
make
it
up
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
never
quarrel
,
to
my
knowledge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
why
do
Leithcourt
leave
Scotland
so
hurriedly
on
Chater
's
arrival
?
<EOS>
You
know
all
about
the
affair
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
nod
,
say
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
know
.
<EOS>
the
party
up
there
must
have
be
a
very
interesting
one
.
<EOS>
if
the
police
could
have
make
a
raid
on
the
place
they
would
have
find
among
the
guest
certain
person
long
'
want
.
'
<EOS>
but
the
arrival
of
Chater
and
the
flight
of
Leithcourt
have
an
ulterior
object
.
<EOS>
chater
have
never
be
Leithcourt
's
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
understand
that
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
Leithcourt
have
attack
Chater
,
render
him
unconscious
,
and
shut
him
up
in
the
cupboard
in
the
library
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
Leithcourt
<EOS>
who
do
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
dubiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
another
of
the
guest
who
be
Chater
's
bitter
enemy
.
<EOS>
but
Philip
Leithcourt
take
advantage
of
the
fracas
in
order
to
make
believe
that
he
have
flee
because
of
Chater
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
"
you
have
not
any
idea
of
their
ruse
.
<EOS>
They
be
amazing
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
it
seem
,
"
I
say
,
nevertheless
only
half
convince
that
the
Italian
be
tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
really
,
as
he
have
say
,
that
the
arrival
of
Chater
and
the
flight
be
merely
a
"
blind
,
"
then
the
mystery
be
again
deepen
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
who
be
the
man
who
attack
Chater
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
Chater
himself
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
guest
,
that
be
quite
evident
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
say
that
the
flight
have
be
prearrange
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
with
a
distinct
motive
,
"
he
say
;
then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
add
,
with
a
strange
,
earnest
look
in
his
dark
eye
,
"
pardon
me
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
if
I
presume
to
suggest
something
,
will
you
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
suggest
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
should
remain
here
,
in
this
hotel
,
and
not
venture
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
fear
of
something
unfortunate
happen
to
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
really
not
afraid
,
<EOS>
Olinto
,
"
I
add
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
carry
this
,
"
and
I
draw
out
my
revolver
from
my
hip
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
signore
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
not
be
afford
opportunity
for
use
it
.
<EOS>
when
they
lie
a
trap
they
bait
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
set
of
the
most
ingenious
scoundrel
in
London
,
it
be
very
evident
.
<EOS>
yet
I
do
not
fear
them
in
the
least
,
"
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
rescue
the
Signorina
Heath
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
signore
,
have
a
care
for
yourself

"
cry
the
Italian
,
lay
his
hand
upon
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
marked
man
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
do
I
not
know
,
"
he
exclaim
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
go
out
you
may
run
right
into
--
well
,
the
fatal
accident
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
fear
,
Olinto
,
"
I
say
reassuringly
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
keep
my
eye
well
open
.
<EOS>
here
,
in
London
,
one
's
life
be
safe
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
,
perhaps
--
certainly
safe
than
in
some
place
I
could
name
in
your
own
country
,
eh
?
"
at
which
he
grin
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
moment
he
grow
serious
again
,
and
say
:
 
"
I
only
warn
the
signore
that
if
he
go
out
it
be
at
his
own
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
let
it
be
so
,
"
I
laugh
,
feel
self
-
confident
that
no
one
could
lead
me
into
any
trap
.
<EOS>
I
be
neither
a
foreigner
nor
a
country
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
know
London
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
silent
and
shake
his
head
;
then
,
after
tell
me
that
he
be
still
at
the
same
restaurant
in
Westbourne
Grove
,
he
take
his
departure
,
warn
me
once
more
not
to
go
forth
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
,
disregard
his
word
,
I
stride
out
into
the
Strand
,
and
again
walk
round
to
the
"
Junior
.
<EOS>
"
the
short
wintry
day
have
end
,
the
gas
-
lamp
be
light
,
and
the
darkness
of
night
be
gradually
creep
on
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
have
not
be
to
the
club
,
and
I
begin
now
to
grow
thoroughly
uneasy
.
<EOS>
He
have
part
from
me
at
the
corner
of
the
Strand
with
only
a
five
minute
'
walk
before
him
,
and
yet
he
have
apparently
disappear
.
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
be
to
drive
to
Notting
Hill
to
inquire
of
Muriel
if
she
have
news
of
him
,
but
somehow
the
Italian
's
warning
word
make
me
wonder
if
he
have
meet
with
foul
play
.
 
<EOS>
I
suddenly
recollect
those
two
man
who
have
pass
by
as
we
have
talk
,
and
how
that
the
feature
of
one
have
seem
strangely
familiar
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
take
a
cab
to
the
police
-
station
down
at
Whitehall
,
and
make
inquiry
of
the
inspector
on
duty
in
the
big
bare
office
with
its
flare
gas
-
jet
in
wire
globe
.
<EOS>
He
hear
me
to
the
end
,
then
turn
back
the
book
of
"
occurrence
"
before
him
,
glance
through
the
rule
entry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
this
be
the
gentleman
,
sir
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
and
he
read
to
me
the
entry
as
follow
:
 
<EOS>
"
P.C.
462a
report
that
at
2.07
a.m.
,
while
on
duty
outside
the
National
Gallery
,
he
hear
a
revolver
shot
,
follow
by
a
man
's
cry
.
<EOS>
He
run
to
the
corner
of
Suffolk
Street
,
where
he
find
a
gentleman
lie
upon
the
pavement
suffer
from
a
serious
shot
-
wound
in
the
chest
and
quite
unconscious
.
<EOS>
He
obtain
the
assistance
of
P.C.
's
218a
and
343A
,
and
the
gentleman
,
who
be

be
take
to
the
Charing
Cross
Hospital
,
where
the
house
-
surgeon
express
a
doubt
whether

<EOS>
neither

<EOS>
I
wait
for
no
more
,
but
rush
round
to
the
hospital
in
the
cab
,
and
be
,
five
minute
later
,
take
along
the
ward
,
where
I
identify
poor
Jack
lie
in
bed
,
white

faced
and
unconscious

none

<EOS>
He
have
never

consciousness

I
fear

he
never
will

<EOS>
It
be
a
case
of
deliberate
murder
,
the
police
tell
me
early
this
morning

"
 
<EOS>
I
clench
my
fist
and
swear
a
fierce
revenge
for
that
dastardly
act
.
<EOS>
and
as
I
stand
beside
the
narrow
bed
,
I
realize
that
what
Olinto
have
say
regard
my
own
peril
be
the
actual
truth
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
marked
man

CHAPTER
XVII
 
<EOS>
the
truth
about
the
"
lola
"
  
<EOS>
throughout
the
long
night
I
call
many
time
at
the
hospital
,
but
the
reply
be
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
Jack
have
not
regain
consciousness
,
and
the
doctor
regard
his
case
as
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
drive
in
hot
haste
to
Bassett
Road
,
Notting
Hill
,
and
at
the
address
<EOS>
Olinto
have
give
me
<EOS>
find
Muriel
.
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
room
with
fold
door
into
which
I
have
be
show
,
I
see
that
she
be
pale
and
apprehensive
,
for
we
have
not
meet
since
her
flight
,
and
she
be
,
no
doubt
,
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
press
her
for
one
.
<EOS>
I
merely
tell
her
that
the
Italian
Santini
have
give
me
her
address
and
that
I
come
as
bearer
of
unfortunate
news

she
gasp
quickly

I
can
tell
there
be
something
more

<EOS>

the
bad

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
say
gravely
,
"
not
dead
,
but
the
doctor
fear
that
he
may
not
recover
.
<EOS>
His
wound
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
shoot
by
some
unknown
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
shot
!
"
<EOS>
she
echo
,
burst
into
tear
.
"
<EOS>
then
they
have
follow
him
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
They
have
deceive
me
,
and
now
,
as
they
intend
to
take
him
from
me
,
I
will
myself
protect
him
.
<EOS>
You
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
have
be
in
peril
of
your
life
,
that
I
know
,
but
Jack
's
enemy
be
yours
,
and
they
shall
not
go
unpunished
.
<EOS>
May
I
see
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
but
we
will
ask
at
the
hospital
.
"
<EOS>
and
after
the
exchange
of
some
further
explanation
,
we
take
a
hansom
back
to
Charing
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
the
sister
refuse
to
allow
Muriel
to
see
the
patient
,
but
she
implore
so
earnestly
that
at
last
she
consent
,
and
the
distressed
girl
in
the
black
coat
and
hat
creep
on
tiptoe
to
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
conscious
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
"
whisper
the
nurse
who
sit
there
,
"
He
ask
after
some
lady
name
Muriel
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
girl
at
my
side
burst
into
low
sobbing
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
him
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
Muriel
be
here
--
that
she
have
see
him
,
and
be
wait
for
him
to
recover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
allow
to
linger
there
,
and
on
leave
the
hospital
I
take
her
back
again
to
Notting
Hill
,
promise
to
keep
her
well
inform
of
Jack
's
condition
.
<EOS>
He
have
return
to
consciousness
,
therefore
there
be
now
a
faint
hope
for
his
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
Day
succeed
day
,
and
although
I
be
not
allow
to
visit
my
friend
,
I
be
tell
that
he
be
very
slowly
progress
.
<EOS>
I
idle
at
the
Hotel
Cecil
longing
daily
for
news
of
Elma
.
<EOS>
only
once
do
a
letter
come
from
her
,
a
brief
,
well
-
write
note
from
which
it
appear
that
she
be
quite
well
and
happy
,
although
she
long
to
be
able
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
be
very
kind
indeed
to
her
,
and
,
she
add
,
be
make
secret
arrangement
for
her
escape
across
the
russian
frontier
into
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
that
mean
.
<EOS>
Use
be
to
be
make
of
certain
russian
official
who
be
secretly
ally
with
the
Revolutionists
in
order
to
secure
her
safe
conduct
beyond
the
power
of
that
order
of
exile
of
the
tyrant
de
Plehve
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
her
under
cover
to
the
Princess
,
but
there
have
be
no
time
yet
for
a
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
Muriel
many
time
,
but
never
once
do
she
refer
to
Rannoch
or
their
sudden
departure
.
<EOS>
Her
only
thought
be
of
the
man
she
love
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
believe
that
you
be
engage
to
Mr.
Woodroffe
,
"
I
say
one
day
,
when
I
call
to
tell
her
of
Jack
's
late
bulletin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
that
he
ask
me
to
marry
him
,
"
she
respond
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
reason
why
I
do
not
accept
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
reason
connect
with
his
past
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
smile
,
and
then
say
:
 
"
ah
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
it
be
all
a
strange
and
very
tragic
story
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
Jack
.
<EOS>
when
do
you
think
they
will
allow
me
to
go
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
explain
that
the
doctor
fear
to
cause
the
patient
any
undue
excitement
,
but
that
in
two
or
three
day
there
be
hope
of
her
be
allow
to
visit
him
.
<EOS>
several
time
the
police
make
inquiry
of
me
,
but
I
could
tell
them
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
recollect
where
I
have
before
see
the
face
of
that
man
who
have
pass
in
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
ten
day
after
the
attempt
upon
Jack
,
I
be
allow
to
sit
by
his
bedside
and
question
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Gordon
,
old
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
faintly
,
"
I
have
have
a
narrow
escape
--
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
after
I
leave
you
I
walk
quickly
on
towards
the
club
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
two
scoundrel
spring
out
of
Suffolk
Street
,
and
one
of
them
fire
a
revolver
full
at
me
.
<EOS>
then
I
know
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
who
be
the
man
?
<EOS>
do
you
recognize
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
bad
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
Muriel
know
who
they
be
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
!
<EOS>
bring
her
here
,
will
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
implore
,
"
I
be
die
to
see
her
once
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
him
how
she
have
look
upon
him
while
unconscious
,
and
how
I
have
take
the
daily
bulletin
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
an
hour
I
talk
with
him
,
urge
him
to
get
well
soon
,
so
that
we
could
unite
in
probe
the
mystery
,
and
bring
to
justice
those
responsible
for
the
dastardly
act
.
 
<EOS>
"
Muriel
know
,
and
if
she
love
you
she
will
no
doubt
assist
us
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
she
do
love
me
,
Gordon
,
I
know
that
,
"
say
the
prostrate
man
,
smile
contentedly
,
and
when
I
leave
I
promise
to
bring
her
there
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
do
,
but
have
conduct
her
to
the
bed
at
the
end
of
the
ward
I
discreetly
withdraw
.
<EOS>
what
she
say
to
him
I
be
not
,
of
course
,
aware
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
that
an
hour
later
when
I
return
I
find
them
the
happy
pair
possible
to
conceive
,
and
I
clearly
see
that
Jack
's
trust
in
her
be
not
ill
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
Elma
?
<EOS>
no
further
word
have
come
from
her
,
and
I
begin
to
grow
uneasy
.
<EOS>
the
day
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
write
twice
,
but
no
reply
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
could
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
,
and
begin
to
contemplate
return
to
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
when
at
last
discharge
from
the
hospital
,
come
across
to
the
Cecil
and
live
with
me
in
preference
to
the
"
Junior
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
very
weak
at
first
,
and
I
look
after
him
,
while
every
day
Muriel
come
and
eat
with
us
,
brighten
our
life
by
her
smart
and
merry
chatter
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
I
love
Elma
and
be
also
aware
of
the
exciting
event
in
Russia
,
Jack
have
tell
her
of
them
during
their
long
drive
in
hansom
when
he
go
out
with
her
to
take
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
I
receive
a
brief
note
from
the
Princess
in
Petersburg
,
urge
me
to
remain
patient
and
say
Elma
be
quite
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
reason
,
however
,
why
she
be
unable
to
write
,
she
add
.
<EOS>
what
be
they
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
yet
I
could
only
wait
until
I
receive
word
to
travel
back
to
Russia
and
fetch
her
home
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
have
promise
to
arrange
everything
.
 
<EOS>
December
come
,
and
we
still
remain
on
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
once
Olinto
have
write
me
repeat
his
warning
,
but
I
do
not
heed
it
.
<EOS>
I
somehow
distrust
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
now
thoroughly
recover
,
call
almost
daily
at
Bassett
Road
,
and
would
often
bring
Muriel
to
the
Cecil
to
tea
or
to
luncheon
.
<EOS>
often
I
inquire
the
whereabouts
of
her
father
and
of
Hylton
Chater
,
but
she
declare
herself
in
entire
ignorance
,
and
believe
they
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
shortly
before
Christmas
,
as
we
be
idle
in
the
american
bar
of
the
hotel
,
my
friend
tell
me
that
Muriel
have
invite
us
to
tea
at
her
cousin
be
that
afternoon
,
and
accordingly
we
go
there
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
the
drawing
-
room
into
which
we
be
ushered
be
familiar
to
me
as
the
apartment
wherein
I
have
tell
Muriel
of
the
attempt
upon
her
lover
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
sit
together
Muriel
,
a
smart
figure
in
a
pale
blue
gown
,
pour
tea
for
us
and
chat
more
merrily
,
I
think
,
than
ever
before
.
<EOS>
She
seem
quick
and
nervous
and
yet
full
of
happiness
,
as
she
should
indeed
have
be
,
for
Jack
Durnford
be
one
of
the
good
fellow
in
the
world
,
and
his
restoration
to
health
little
short
of
miraculous
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gordon
,
"
he
say
to
me
with
a
sudden
seriousness
when
tea
have
end
and
we
have
place
down
our
cup
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
something
--
something
I
have
be
long
always
to
tell
you
,
and
now
I
have
get
dear
Muriel
's
consent
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
tell
you
about
her
father
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
about
Elma
,
too
?
"
I
say
in
quick
eagerness
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
tell
me
everything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
everything
,
for
I
do
not
know
it
myself
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
know
I
will
explain
as
briefly
as
I
can
,
and
leave
you
to
form
your
own
conclusion
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
a
strange
--
most
amazing
story
.
<EOS>
when
I
myself
become
first
cognizant
of
the
mystery
I
be
on
board
the
flagship
the
_
Renown
_
,
under
Admiral
Sir
John
Fisher
.
<EOS>
We
be
lie
in
Malta
when
there
arrive
the
english
yacht
_
Iris
_
,
own
by
Mr.
Philip
Leithcourt
,
and
among
those
on
board
cruise
for
pleasure
be
Mr.
Martin
Woodroffe
,
Mr.
Hylton
Chater
,
and
the
owner
's
wife
and
daughter
Muriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Muriel
and
I
meet
first
at
a
tennis
-
party
,
and
afterwards
frequently
at
various
house
in
Malta
,
for
anyone
who
go
there
and
entertain
be
soon
entertain
in
return
.
<EOS>
a
mutual
attachment
spring
up
between
Muriel
and
myself
,
"
he
say
,
place
his
hand
tenderly
upon
hers
and
smile
,
"
and
we
often
meet
in
secret
and
take
long
walk
,
<EOS>
until
quite
suddenly
Leithcourt
say
that
it
be
necessary
to
sail
for
Smyrna
to
pick
up
some
friend
who
have
be
travel
in
Palestine
.
<EOS>
the
night
they
sail
a
great
consternation
be
cause
on
the
island
by
the
news
that
the
safe
in
the
Admiral
Superintendent
's
office
have
be
open
by
expert
safe
-
breaker
,
and
certain
most
important
secret
document
steal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
I
ask
,
much
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
again
,
two
month
later
,
when
the
villa
of
the
Prince
of
Montevachi
,
at
Palmero
,
be
break
into
and
the
whole
of
the
famous
jewel
of
the
Princess
steal
,
it
be
a
very
strange
fact
that
the
_
Iris
_
be
at
the
moment
in
that
port
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
until
the
third
occasion
,
when
the
yacht
be
at
Villefranche
,
and
our
squadron
be
at
Toulon
<EOS>
I
get
four
day
'
leave
to
go
along
the
Riviera
,
that
my
suspicion
be
arouse
,
for
at
the
very
hour
when
I
be
dine
at
the
London
House
at
Nice
with
Muriel
and
a
schoolfellow
of
her
,
Elma
Heath
--
who
be
spend
the
winter
there
with
a
lady
who
be
Baron
Oberg
's
cousin
--
that
a
great
robbery
be
commit
in
one
of
the
big
hotel
up
at
Cimiez
,
the
wife
of
an
american
millionaire
lose
jewel
value
at
thirty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
then
the
robbery
,
coincident
with
the
visit
of
the
yacht
,
arouse
my
strong
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
remark
the
nature
of
those
document
steal
from
Malta
,
and
recognize
that
they
could
only
be
of
service
to
a
foreign
government
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
Leghorn
incident
of
which
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
the
yacht
's
name
have
be
change
to
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
she
have
be
repaint
.
<EOS>
I
make
search
inquiry
,
and
find
that
on
the
evening
she
be
purposely
run
aground
in
order
to
strike
up
a
friendship
at
the
Consulate
,
a
russian
gunboat
be
lie
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
the
Consul
's
safe
be
rifle
,
and
the
scheme
certainly
be
to
transfer
anything
obtain
from
it
to
the
russian
gunboat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
in
the
safe
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
fortunately
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
they
know
that
our
squadron
be
due
in
Leghorn
,
and
that
some
extremely
important
despatch
be
on
the
way
to
the
Admiral
--
secret
order
base
upon
the
decision
of
the
British
Cabinet
as
to
the
vexed
question
of
russian
ship
pass
the
dardanelle
--
they
expect
that
they
would
be
lodge
in
the
safe
until
the
arrival
of
the
squadron
,
as
they
always
be
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
however
,
bitterly
disappoint
because
the
despatch
have
not
arrive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
then
?
"
 
"
well
,
the
only
Russian
who
appear
to
have
any
connection
with
them
be
Baron
Oberg
,
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
,
whose
habit
it
be
to
spend
part
of
the
winter
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
from
Elma
Heath
's
conversation
at
dinner
that
evening
at
Nice
<EOS>
I
gather
that
she
and
her
uncle
have
be
guest
on
the
_
Iris
_
on
several
occasion
,
although
I
must
say
that
Muriel
be
extremely
reticent
regard
all
that
concern
the
yacht
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
she
say
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
now
that
I
have
tell
you
the
truth
,
Jack
,
do
not
you
think
it
be
only
natural
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
certainly
,
dear
,
"
he
answer
,
still
hold
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Yours
be
not
a
secret
that
you
could
very
well
tell
to
me
until
you
could
thoroughly
trust
me
,
especially
as
your
father
have
be
implicate
in
the
theft
of
those
document
from
Malta
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
me
,
"
Philip
Leithcourt
have
all
along
be
the
catspaw
of
Baron
Oberg

<EOS>
a
few
year
ago
he
be
a
well
-
know
money
-
lender
in
the
city
,
and
in
that
capacity
meet
the
Baron
,
who
,
be
in
disgrace
,
require
a
loan
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
in
the
habit
of
have
certain
shady
transaction
with
that
dare
gang
of
continental
thief
of
whom
Dick
Archer
and
Hylton
Chater
be
leader
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
he
purchase
a
yacht
for
their
use
,
so
that
they
may
not
only
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
store
the
steal
good
,
but
for
the
purpose
of
sailing
from
place
to
place
under
the
guise
of
wealthy
Englishmen
travel
for
pleasure
.
<EOS>
upon
that
vessel
,
indeed
,
be
store
thousand
and
thousand
of
pound
'
worth
of
jewel
and
object
of
value
,
the
proceed
of
many
great
robbery
in
England
,
France
and
Belgium
.
<EOS>
sometimes
they
travel
for
the
purpose
of
dispose
of
the
jewel
in
various
inland
town
where
the
gem
,
have
be
recut
,
be
not

,
while
at
other
time
,
Chater
and
Archer
,
assist
by
Mackintosh
,
the
captain
,
and
Olinto
Santini
,
the
steward
,
sail
for
a
port
,
land
,
commit
a
robbery
,
and
then
sail
away
again
,
quite
unsuspected
,
as
rich
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
the
crew
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
of
course
,
well
pay
,
and
be
keep
in
ignorance
of
what
the
suppose
owner
and
his
friend
do
ashore
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
Oberg
's
connection
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
surprised
at
those
revelation
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
exclaim
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
the
ingenuity
of
that
crafty
villain
be
fiendish
.
<EOS>
before
he
get
into
the
Czar
's
favor
he
owe
my
father
a
large
sum
,
and
then
seek
how
to
evade
repayment
.
<EOS>
by
mean
of
his
spy
he
discover
the
real
purpose
of
the
cruise
of
the
_
<EOS>
Iris_--for
<EOS>
I
be
often
take
on
board
with
a
maid
in
order
to
allay
any
suspicion
that
may
arise
if
only
man
be
cruise
.
<EOS>
then
he
not
only
compel
my
father
to
cancel
the
debt
,
but
he
impress
the
vessel
and
those
who
own
and
navigate
it
into
the
secret
service
of
Russia
.
<EOS>
a
dozen
time
do
we
make
attempt
to
obtain
secret
paper
from
italian
,
french
and
english
dockyard
,
but
only
once
in
the
case
of
Malta
and
once
at
Toulon
do
we
succeed
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
she
add
,
"
you
do
not
know
all
the
anxiety
I
suffer

and
of
the
hundred
narrow
escape

have

of
Custom
House

<EOS>
You
will
no
doubt
recollect
the
sensation
cause
by
the
theft
of
the
jewel
of
the
Princess
Wilhelmine
of
Schaumbourg
-
Lippe
from
the
lady's
-
maid
in
the
rapide
between
Cannes

Les
Arcs
,
the
robbery
from
the
Marseilles
branch
of
the
Credit
Lyonnais
,
and
the
great
haul
of
plate
from
the
chateau
of
Bardon
,
the
Paris
millionaire
,
close
to
Arcachon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
for
they
be
all
robbery
of
which
I
have
read
in
the
newspaper
a
couple
of
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
she
say
,
"
they
be
all
commit
by
Archer
or
Woodroffe
and
his
gang
--
with
accomplice
ashore
,
of
course
--
and
never
once
do
it
seem
that
any
suspicion
fall
upon
us
.
<EOS>
while
the
police
be
frantically
search
hither
and
thither
,
we
use
to
weigh
anchor
and
calmly
steam
away
with
our
booty
on
board
.
<EOS>
We
have
with
us
an
old
dutch
lapidary
,
and
one
of
the
cabin
be
fit
as
a
workshop
,
where
he
alter
the
appearance

"
 
<EOS>

but
that
night
in
Leghorn
?
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
happen
to
poor
Elma
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
be
Muriel
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
both
on
board
together
,
and
stand
at
the
crack
of
the
door
watch
you
sit
at
dinner
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Elma
tell
me
that
she
believe
that
there
be
a
plot
against
your
life
,
but
why
she
would
not
tell
me
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
know
of
the
propose
rifling
of
the
safe
at
the
Consulate
.
<EOS>
Oberg
himself
be
also
on
board
,
lock
in
his
own
cabin
.
<EOS>
Elma
must
have
overhear
some
conversation
between
the
Baron
and
one
of
the
other
,
for
she
be
in
great
fear
the
whole
time
lest
they
may
injure
you
.
<EOS>
yet
it
seem
,
after
all
,
as
though
their
idea
be
the
same
as
always
,
to
worm
themselves
into
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
the
instant
,
however
,
you
go
ashore
,
Chater
,
Woodroffe
--
whom
you
call
Hornby
--
and
Mackintosh
,
the
captain
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
be
an
old
ticket
-
of
-
leave
man
--
go
ashore
,
and
,
of
course
,
break
into
the
Consulate

<EOS>
then
,
as
soon
as
they
return
,
Elma
come
to
my
cabin
,
awake
me
,
and
say
that
the
Baron
be
take
her
ashore
,
and
that
they
be
to
travel
overland
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
She
be
ready
dress
to
go
,
therefore
I
kiss
her
,
and
promise
to
meet
her
soon
,
we
part
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
last
I
see
of
her
.
<EOS>
what
happen
to
her
afterwards
<EOS>
only
she
alone
can
tell
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
she
be
not
the
Baron
's
niece
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
mystery
,
"
declare
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
hold
some
secret
which
he
fear
she
may
divulge
.
<EOS>
but
of
what
nature
,
I
be
in
ignorance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
say
that
your
father
have
never
take
any
active
part
in
the
robbery
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
He
commence
by
lend
money
,
and
amass
a
considerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
then
avarice
seize
him
,
as
it
do
so
many
man
,
and
come
into
contact
with
Archer
and
his
friend
<EOS>
,
he
see
that
the
idea
of
the
yacht
be
a
safe
and
profitable
one
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
purchase
the
vessel
,
and
run
it
at
the
disposition
of
the
thief
,
and
subsequently
under
compulsion
in
the
secret
service
of
Russia
,
as
I
have
already
describe
to
you
.
<EOS>
the
profit
be
colossal
.
<EOS>
in
one
year
my
father
's
share
be
eighty
thousand
pound
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
your
father
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
sadly
,
her
face
pale
and
haggard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
that
the
vessel
be
scuttle
somewhere
in
the
Baltic
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
Oberg
's
purpose
have
be
serve
,
he
demand
half
the
property
on
board
,
or
he
would
give
notice
to
the
russian
naval
authority
that
the
pirate
yacht
be
afloat
.
<EOS>
He
attempt
to
blackmail
my
father
,
as
he
have
already
do
so
many
time
,
but
his
scheme
be
frustrate
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
because
of
his
inhuman
treatment
of
poor
Elma
,
defy
him
,
when
it
appear
that
Oberg
,
who
be
in
Helsingfors
,
telegraph
to
the
admiral
of
the
russian
fleet
in
the
Baltic
.
<EOS>
the
crew
from
the
_
Iris
_
be
at
once
land
at
Riga
,
and
only
Mackintosh
and
my
father
put
to
sea
again
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
my
father
be
desperate
,
for
he
know
the
merciless
character
of
that
man
whose
victim
he
have
be
for
so
long
.
<EOS>
They
watch
a
russian
cruiser
bear
down
upon
them
,
when
,
just
as
it
draw
near
,
they
get
off
in
a
boat
and
blow
up
the
yacht
,
which
sink
in
three
minute
with
its
ill
-
obtain
wealth
on
board
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
and
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
and
I
see
tear
stand
in
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
tragedy
,
"
Jack
explain
in
a
low
,
hoarse
voice
.
"
<EOS>
He
and
the
captain
do
not
,
unfortunately
,
get
sufficiently
far
from
the
yacht
when
they
blow
her
up
,
and
they
go
down
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
look
in
silence
at
Muriel
,
who
stand
with
her
head
bent
and
her
white
face
cover
with
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
almost
at
the
same
moment
there
be
a
low
tap
at
the
door
,
and
the
servant
-
maid
announce
:
 
"
Mr.
Santini
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
exclaim
Jack
quickly
,
as
Olinto
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
my
note
!
<EOS>
We
have
ask
you
here
to
reveal
to
us
this
dastardly
plot
which
seem
to
have
be
form
against
Mr.
Gregg
and
myself
.
<EOS>
as
you
know
,
I
have
have
a
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
signore
.
<EOS>
and
the
Signor
Commendatore
be
also
threaten
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
those
who
kill
my
poor
wife
,
and
who
intend
also
to
silence
me
,
"
be
his
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
same
who
compel
you
take
me
to
that
house
<EOS>
where
the
fatal
chair
be
prepare
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
Archer
,
who
,
fear
that
you
come
to
London
in
search
of
them
,
devise
that
devilish
contrivance
,
"
he
say
in
his
broken
English
.
<EOS>
then
continue
,
he
go
on
fiercely
:
"
<EOS>
now
that
I
have
discover
why
my
poor
Armida
be
kill
,
I
will
tell
the
truth
,
and
not
spare
them
.
<EOS>
since
you
leave
Scotland
,
signore
,
I
have
be
up
in
dumfrie
,
and
have
discover
several
fact
which
prove
that
for
some
reason
know
only
to
himself
,
Leithcourt
,
while
at
Rannoch
,
write
to
both
Armida
and
myself
separately
,
make
an
appointment
to
see
us
at
the
same
time
at
that
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
as
he
have
some
secret
commission
to
entrust
to
us
.
<EOS>
the
letter
address
to
me
apparently
fall
into
someone
else
's
hand
--
probably
one
of
the
secret
agent
of
Baron
Oberg
,
who
be
always
watch
Leithcourt
's
doing
,
and
he
,
anxious
to
learn
what
be
intend
,
make
himself
up
to
look
like
me
,
and
keep
the
appointment
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
Armida
,
have
receive
the
letter
unknown
to
me
,
go
up
to
Scotland
,
and
be
also
there
at
the
appoint
time
.
<EOS>
what
actually
transpire
can
only
be
surmise
,
yet
it
seem
that
Leithcourt
be
in
the
habit
of
go
up
to
that
spot
and
loitering
there
in
the
evening
in
order
to
meet
Chater
in
secret
,
as
the
latter
be
in
hiding
in
a
small
hotel
in
dumfrie
.
<EOS>
therefore
those
who
form
the
plot
must
have
endeavor
to
throw
suspicion
upon
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
,
however
,
as
both
myself
and
Armida
know
the
gang
,
it
be
to
their
interest
to
get
rid
of
us
,
because
the
suspicion
of
the
police
have
at
last
become
aroused
.
<EOS>
Poor
Armida
be
therefore
deliberately
entice
there
to
her
death
,
while
the
inquisitive
man
whom
the
assassin
take
to
be
myself
be
also
strike
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
by
whom
?
"
 
"
not
by
Chater
,
for
he
be
in
London
on
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
by
Woodroffe
?
"
<EOS>
Durnford
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
most
cleverly
think
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
his
advantage
alone
to
close
our
lip
,
because
in
that
same
fatal
chair
in
Lambeth
old
Jacob
Moser
,
the
Jew
bullion
-
broker
of
Hatton
Garden
,
meet
his
death
--
a
most
dastardly
crime
,
with
which
none
of
his
friend
be
associate
,
and
of
which
we
alone
hold
knowledge
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
write
to
us
as
though
from
Leithcourt
,
call
us
up
to
Rannoch
,
in
order
to
strike
the
blow
in
the
darkness
,
"
he
add
in
his
peculiar
italian
manner
.
"
<EOS>
besides
,
he
fear
we
would
tell
the
signore
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
tell
the
police
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
,
signore
.
<EOS>
surely
the
less
the
police
know
about
this
matter
the
well
,
otherwise
the
Signorina
Leithcourt
must
suffer
for
her
father
's
avarice
and
evil
-
doing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
cry
Jack
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
,
Olinto
.
<EOS>
the
police
must
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
reprisal
we
must
make
ourselves
.
<EOS>
but
who
be
it
who
shoot
me
in
Suffolk
Street
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
same
man
,
Martin
Woodroffe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
the
assassin
be
back
from
Russia
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
follow
closely
behind
the
Signor
Commendatore
.
<EOS>
Markoff
,
a
clever
secret
agent
of
Baron
Oberg
's
,
come
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
for
the
first
time
I
recollect
that
the
man
I
have
recognize
in
the
Strand
be
a
fellow
I
have
see
lounge
in
the
ante
-
room
of
the
palace
of
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
.
<EOS>
the
pair
,
fear
that
I
should
reveal
what
I
know
,
be
undoubtedly
in
London
to
take
my
life
in
secret
.
<EOS>
now
that
Leithcourt
be
dead
,
Woodroffe
have
unite
force
with
Oberg
,
and
intend
to
silence
me
because
they
fear
that
Elma
,
besides
escape
them
,
have
also
reveal
her
secret
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
that
the
Signorina
Leithcourt
have
explain
the
story
of
the
yacht
and
its
crew
,
"
Olinto
remark
.
"
<EOS>
and
have
also
show
you
how
I
be
implicate
.
<EOS>
You
will
therefore
discern
the
reason
why
I
have
hitherto
fear
to
give
you
any
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
Miss
Leithcourt
have
tell
me
a
great
deal
,
but
not
everything
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
gather
for
what
reason
she
and
her
father
flee
from
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
tell
you
,
"
say
Muriel
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
suspect
Woodroffe
of
be
the
assassin
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
for
he
know
that
he
have
break
away
from
the
original
compact
,
and
have
now
ally
himself
with
Oberg
.
<EOS>
yet
it
be
also
my
father
's
object
to
appear
in
fear
of
them
,
because
he
be
only
await
an
opportunity
to
lay
plan
for
poor
Elma
's
rescue
from
Finland
.
<EOS>
therefore
one
evening
Woodroffe
call
,
and
my
father
encounter
him
in
the
avenue
,
and
admit
him
with
his
own
latchkey
by
one
of
the
side
door
of
the
castle
,
afterwards
take
him
up
to
the
study
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
come
to
try
and
make
term
for
Oberg
,
therefore
he
see
that
he
must
fly
at
once
to
Newcastle
,
where
the
_
Iris
_
be
lie
,
get
on
board
,
and
sail
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
some
excuse
he
leave
him
in
the
study
,
and
then
warn
my
mother
and
myself
to
prepare
to
leave
.
<EOS>
but
while
we
be
pack
,
it
appear
that
Chater
,
who
have
follow
,
be
show
into
the
study
by
the
butler
,
or
rather
he
enter
there
himself
,
be
well
acquaint
with
the
house
.
<EOS>
thus
the
two
man
,
now
bitter
enemy
,
meet
.
<EOS>
a
fierce
quarrel
must
have
ensue
,
and
Chater
be
poison
and
conceal
,
Woodroffe
,
of
course
,
believe
he
have
kill
him
.
<EOS>
My
father
enter
the
study
again
,
and
see
only
Woodroffe
there
,
do
not
know
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
some
word
probably
arise
,
when
my
father
again
turn
and
leave
.
<EOS>
then
we
flee
to
Carlisle
and
on
to
Newcastle
,
and
next
morning
be
on
board
the
yacht
out
in
the
North
Sea
,
afterwards
land
at
Rotterdam
.
<EOS>
those
,
"
she
add
,
"
be
briefly
the
fact
,
as
my
poor
father
relate
them
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
of
poor
Elma
--
and
of
her
secret
?
<EOS>
when
,
I
wonder
,
shall
I
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
her
now
,
signore
,
"
answer
Olinto
.
<EOS>
"
a
servant
of
the
Princess
Zurloff
bring
her
to
London
this
afternoon
,
and
I
have
just
convey
her
from
the
station
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
next
room
,
in
ignorance
,
however
,
that
you
be
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
without
another
word
I
flee
forward
joyfully
,
and
throw
open
the
fold
-
door
which
separate
me
from
my
silent
love
.
 
<EOS>
silent
,
yes
!
<EOS>
but
she
could
,
nevertheless
,
tell
her
story
--
surely
the
strange
that
any
woman
have
ever
live
to
tell
.

CONTAINS
ELMA
's
<EOS>
STORY
  
<EOS>
before
me
stand
my
love
,
a
slim
,
tragic
,
rather
wan
figure
in
a
heavy
dark
traveling
-
coat
and
feel
toque
,
her
sweet
lip
part
and
a
look
of
bewilder
amazement
upon
her
countenance
as
I
burst
in
so
suddenly
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
in
silence
I
grasp
her
tiny
black
-
gloved
hand
,
and
then
,
also
in
silence
,
raise
it
passionately
to
my
eager
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
soft
,
dark
eye
--
those
eye
that
speak
although
she
be
mute
--
meet
mine
,
and
in
them
be
a
look
that
I
have
never
see
there
before
--
a
look
which
as
plainly
as
any
word
tell
me
that
my
wild
fevered
passion
be
reciprocate
.
 
<EOS>
She
gaze
beyond
into
the
room
where
the
other
have
assemble
,
and
then
look
at
me
inquiringly
<EOS>
,
whereupon
I
lead
her
forward
to
where
they
be
,
and
Muriel
fall
upon
her
and
kiss
her
with
tear
stream
from
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
prepare
this
surprise
for
you
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
Muriel
say
,
laugh
through
her
tear
of
joy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Olinto
learn
that
she
be
on
her
way
to
London
,
and
I
send
him
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
have
manage
magnificently
,
have
she
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
thank
God
she
be
free
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
but
we
must
induce
her
to
tell
us
everything
.
"
 
<EOS>
Muriel
be
already
help
my
love
out
of
her
heavy
russian
coat
,
a
costly
garment
line
with
sable
,
and
when
,
after
greet
Jack
and
Olinto
,
she
be
comfortably
seat
,
I
take
some
notepaper
from
the
little
writing
-
table
by
the
window
and
scribble
in
pencil
the
word
:
 
"
I
need
not
write
how
delighted
I
be
that
you
be
safe
<EOS>
--
that
the
Almighty
have
hear
my
prayer
for
you
.
<EOS>
Jack
and
Muriel
have
tell
me
all
about
Leithcourt
and
his
scoundrelly
associate

<EOS>
I
know
,
too

for
I
may
call
you
that
,
may
I
not?--how
terribly
you
must
have
suffer
in
silence
through
it
all

<EOS>
Leithcourt
be
dead
.
<EOS>
He
sink
the
yacht
with
all
the
steal
property
on
board
,
but
by
accident
be
himself
engulf
.
"
 
<EOS>
bend
and
watch
intently
as
I
write
,
she
draw
back
in
horror
and
surprise
at
the
word
.
<EOS>
then
I
add
:
"
We
be
all
four
determine
that
the
guilty
shall
not
go
unpunished
,
and
that
the
affliction
place
upon
you
shall
be
adequately
avenge
.
<EOS>
You
be
my
own
love
--
I
be
bold
enough
to
call
you
so
.
<EOS>
some
strong
but
mysterious
bond
of
affinity
between
us
cause
me
to
seek
you
out
,
and
your
pictured
face
seem
to
call
me
to
your
side
although
I
be
unaware
of
your
peril
.
<EOS>
I
be
send
to
you
by
the
unseen
power
to
extricate
you
from
the
hand
of
your
enemy

<EOS>
therefore
tell
us
everything
--
all
that
you
know
--
without
fear
,
for
now
that
we

unite
no

<EOS>
She
take
the
pencil
,
and
hold
it
in
her
white
finger
sit
stare
first
at
us
,
and
then
look
hesitatingly
at
the
white
paper
before
her
.
<EOS>
Her
position
,
amid
a
hundred
conflict
emotion
,
be
one
of
extreme
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
even
now
she
be
loth
to
reveal
to
us
the
absolute
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
,
stand
behind
her
chair
,
tenderly
stroke
back
the
wealth
of
chestnut
hair
from
her
white
brow
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
perfect
,
even
though
her
face
be
pale
and
jade
,
and
her
eye
heavy
,
consequent
upon
her
long
,
weary
journey
from
the
now
freeze
North
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
when
by
sign
both
Jack
and
Olinto
have
urge
her
to
write
,
she
bend
suddenly
,
and
her
pencil
begin
to
run
swiftly
over
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
all
of
us
stand
exchange
glance
in
silence
,
neither
look
over
her
,
but
each
determined
to
wait
in
patience
until
the
end
.
<EOS>
once
start
,
however
,
she
do
not
pause
.
<EOS>
sheet
after
sheet
she
cover
.
<EOS>
the
silence
for
a
long
time
be
complete
,
break
only
by
the
rapid
running
of
the
pencil
over
the
rough
surface
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
She
have
apparently
become
seize
by
a
sudden
determination
to
explain
everything
,
now
that
she
see
we
be
in
real
,
dead
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
I
watch
her
sweet
face
bent
so
intently
,
and
as
the
firelight
fall
across
it
find
it
incomparable
.
<EOS>
yes
;
she
be
afflict
by
loss
of
speech
,
it
be
true
,
yet
she
be
surely
inexpressibly
sweet
and
womanly
,
peerless
above
all
other
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
deep
-
draw
sigh
<EOS>
she
at
last
finish
,
and
,
her
head
still
bow
in
an
attitude
of
humiliation
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
she
hand
what
she
have
write
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
breathless
eagerness
I
read
as
follow
:
 
"
be
it
true
,
dear
love
--
<EOS>
for
I
call
you
so
in
return
--
that
you
be
impel
towards
me
by
the
mysterious
hand
that
direct
all
thing
?
<EOS>
You
come
in
search
of
me
,
and
you
risk
your
life
for
mine
at
Kajana
,
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
,
as
my
champion
,
and
the
Princess
as
my
friend
,
have
contrive
to
effect
my
freedom
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
for
you
,
I
should
ere
this
have
be
on
my
way
to
Saghalien
,
to
the
tomb
to
which
Oberg
have
so
ingeniously
contrive
to
consign
me
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
--
you
never
can
know
--
all
that
I
have
suffer
ever
since
I
be
a
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
the
statement
break
off
,
and
recommence
as
follow
:
 
<EOS>
"
in
order
that
you
should
understand
the
truth
,
I
have
better
begin
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
an
english
merchant
in
Petersburg
,
and
my
mother
,
Vera
Bessanoff
,
who
,
before
her
marriage
with
my
father
,
be
celebrate
at
Court
for
her
beauty
,
and
be
one
of
the
maid
-
of
-
honor
to
the
Czarina
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
only
daughter
of
Count
Paul
Bessanoff
,
ex
-
governor
of
Kharkoff
,
and
before
marry
my
father
she
have
,
with
her
mother
,
be
a
well
-
know
figure
in
society
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
her
marriage
her
father
die
,
leave
her
in
possession
of
an
ample
fortune
,
which
,
with
my
father
's
own
wealth
,
place
them
among
the
rich
and
most
influential
in
Petersburg
.
 
<EOS>
"
among
my
father
's
most
intimate
friend
be
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
--
who
,
at
that
time
,
hold
a
very
subordinate
position
in
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
--
and
from
my
early
recollection
I
can
remember
him
come
frequently
to
our
house
and
be
invite
to
the
brilliant
entertainment
which
my
mother
give
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
thirteen
,
however
,
my
father
die
of
a
chill
contract
while
boar
-
hunting
on
his
estate
in
Kiev
,
and
within
a
few
month
a
further
disaster
happen
to
us
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
while
I
be
sit
alone
read
aloud
to
my
mother
,
two
stranger
be
announce
,
and
on
be
show
in
they
arrest
my
dear
mother
on
a
charge
of
complicity
in
a
revolutionary
plot
against
the
Czar
which
have
be
discover
at
Peterhof
.
<EOS>
I
stand
defiant
and
indignant
,
for
my
mother
be
certainly
no
Nihilist
,
yet
they
say
that
the
bomb
have
be
introduce
into
the
palace
by
the
Countess
Anna
Shiproff
,
one
of
the
lady
-
in
-
waiting
,
who
be
an
intimate
friend
of
my
mother
's
and
often
use
to
visit
her
.
<EOS>
They
allege
that
the
conspiracy
have
be
hatch
in
our
house
,
color
be
lend
to
that
theory
by
the
fact
that
a
year
before
a
well
-
know
Russian
with
whom
my
father
have
have
many
business
dealing
have
be
prove
to
be
the
author
of
the
plot
by
which
the
Czar
's
train
be
blow
up
near
Lividia
.
<EOS>
They
tear
my
mother
away
from
me
and
place
her
in
that
gray
prison
-
van
,
the
sight
of
which
in
the
street
of
Petersburg
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
every
Russian
,
for
a
person
once
in
that
rumble
vehicle
be
,
as
you
know
,
lose
for
ever
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
from
the
window
be
place
in
that
fatal
conveyance
,
and
then
I
think
I
must
have
faint
,
for
I
recollect
nothing
more
until
I
find
myself
upon
the
floor
,
with
the
gray
dawn
spreading
,
and
all
the
horrible
truth
come
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
mother
be
go
from
me
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
"
in
sheer
desperation
I
go
to
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
and
seek
an
interview
with
the
Baron
,
who
,
when
I
tell
him
of
the
disaster
,
appear
greatly
concerned
,
and
go
at
once
to
the
Police
Department
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
however
,
he
come
to
me
with
the
news
that
the
charge
against
my
mother
have
be
prove
by
a
statement
of
the
woman
Shiproff
herself
,
and
that
she
have
already
start
on
her
long
journey
to
Siberia
--
she
have
be
exile
to
one
of
those
dread
arctic
settlement
beyond
Yakutsk
,
a
place
where
it
be
almost
eternal
winter
,
and
where
the
condition
of
life
be
such
that
half
the
convict
be
insane
.
<EOS>
the
Baron
,
however
,
declare
that
,
as
my
father
's
friend
,
it
be
his
duty
to
act
as
guardian
to
me
,
and
that
as
my
father
have
be
English
I
ought
to
be
put
to
an
english
school
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
with
his
self
-
assume
title
of
uncle
,
he
take
me
to
Chichester
.
<EOS>
for
year
I
remain
there
,
until
one
day
he
come
suddenly
and
fetch
me
away
,
take
me
over
to
Helsingfors
--
for
the
Czar
have
now
appoint
him
Governor
-
General
to
Finland
.
<EOS>
there
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
introduce
me
to
his
son
Michael
,
a
pimply
-
face
lieutenant
of
cavalry
,
and
say
in
a
most
decisive
manner
that
I
must
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
naturally
refuse
to
marry
a
man
of
whom
I
know
so
little
,
whereupon
,
find
me
obdurate
,
he
quickly
alter
his
tactic
and
become
kindness
itself
,
say
that
as
I
be
young
he
would
allow
me
a
year
in
which
to
make
up
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
week
later
,
while
live
in
the
palace
at
Helsingfors
,
I
overhear
a
conversation
between
the
Governor
-
General
and
his
son
,
which
reveal
to
me
a
staggering
truth
that
I
have
never
suspect
.
<EOS>
It
be
Oberg
himself
who
have
denounce
my
mother
to
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
,
and
have
make
those
cruel
,
baseless
charge
against
her
!
<EOS>
then
I
discern
the
reason
.
<EOS>
She
be
exile
,
her
fortune
,
as
well
as
that
of
my
father
,
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
reason
they
be
scheme
for
Michael
to
marry
me
be
in
order
to
obtain
control
of
my
money
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
once
how
helpless
I
be
in
the
hand
of
that
unscrupulous
pair
,
and
I
recognize
,
too
,
sufficient
of
the
Baron
's
method
as
'
the
Strangler
of
Finland
,
'
to
show
me
what
kind
of
character
he
be
beneath
that
calm
,
eminently
respectable
black
-
coated
exterior
.
<EOS>
after
deliberately
send
my
poor
mother
to
Siberia
,

may
,
when

come
of
age

the
idea
no
doubt
be
that

then
,
after
the
necessary
legal
formality

I
should

remain
there
nearly
a
month

"
<EOS>
while
there
I
receive
a
secret
message
from
'
the
Red
Priest
,
'
the
unseen
and
unknown
power
of
Nihilism
,
who
have
for
so
many
year
baffle
the

<EOS>
I
go
to
see
him
,
and
he
reveal
to
me
how
Oberg
have
contrive
to
have
my
mother
banish
upon
a
false
charge

<EOS>
He
warn
me
against
the
man
who
have
pretend
to
be
my
father
's
friend
,
and
also
tell
me
that
he
have
know
my
father
intimately
,
and
that
if
I
get
into
any
further
difficulty
I
be
to
communicate
with
him
and
he
would
assist
me

<EOS>
Oberg
take
me
back
to
helsingfor
a
few
month
later
,
and
in
summer
we
go
to
England
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
marvelously
clever
diplomatist
.
<EOS>
His
tactic
he
could
change
at

.
<EOS>
when
I
be
at
school
he
be
rough
and
brutal
in
his
manner
towards
me
,
as
he
be
to
all
;
but
now
he
seem
to
be
endeavor
to
inspire
my
confidence
by
treat
me
with
kindly
regard
and
pleasant
affability

<EOS>
"
in
London
,
at
Claridge
's
,
we
meet
my
old
schoolfellow
Muriel
and
her
father
--
a
friend
of
Oberg's
--
and
in
response
to
their
invitation
go
for
a
cruise
on
their
yacht
,
the
_
Iris
_
,
from
Southampton
.
<EOS>
Our
party
be
a
very
pleasant
one
,
and
include
Woodroffe
and
Chater
,
while
our
cruise
across
the
Bay
of
Biscay
and
along
the
portuguese
coast
prove
most
delightful
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
while
we
be
lie
outside
Lisbon
,
Woodroffe
and
Chater
,
together
with
Olinto
,
go
ashore
,
and
when
they
return
in
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
they
awake
me
by
cross
the
deck
above
my
head
.
<EOS>
then
I
hear
someone
outside
my
cabin
-
door
work
as
though
with
a
screwdriver
,
unscrew
a
screw
from
the
woodwork
.
<EOS>
this
arouse
my
interest
,
and
next
day
I
make
a
minute
examination
of
the
paneling
,
<EOS>
where
,
in
one
part
,
I
find
two
small
brass
screw
that
have
evidently
be
recently
remove
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
succeed
in
get
hold
of
a
screwdriver
from
the
carpenter
's
shop
,
and
next
night
,
when
everyone
be
asleep
,
I
creep
out
and
unscrewed
the
panel
,
<EOS>
when
to
my
surprise
I
see
that
the
secret
cavity
behind
be
fill
with
beautiful
jewelry
,
diamond
collar
,
tiara
,
necklet
,
fine
pearl
,
emerald
and
turquoise
,
all
_
throw
_
in
indiscriminately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
replace
the
panel
and
keep
careful
watch
.
<EOS>
at
Marseilles
,
where
we
call
,
more
jewelry
and
a
heavy
bagful
of
plate
be
bring
aboard
and
secrete
behind
another
panel
.
<EOS>
then
I
know
that
the
man
be
thief
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
surely
,
"
continue
the
strange
story
my
mute
love
have
write
,
"
I
need
not
describe
all
that
occur
upon
that
eventful
voyage
,
except
to
tell
you
of
one
very
curious
incident
which
occur
.
<EOS>
I
have
speak
confidentially
with
Muriel
regard
my
suspicion
of
the
man
who
be
our
fellow
-
guest
,
and
when
in
secret
I
show
her
several
place
on
board
the
yacht
where
valuable
be
secrete
,
she
also
become
convinced
that
the
man
be
expert
thief
to
whom
her
father
,
for
some
unexplained
reason
,
render
assistance
and
asylum
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
that
since
she
have
leave
school
she
have
be
on
quite
a
number
of
cruise
,
and
that
the
same
party
always
accompany
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
however
,
never
suspect
the
truth
until
I
point
it
out
to
her
.
<EOS>
well
,
one
hot
summer
's
night
we
be
lie
off
Naples
,
and
as
it
be
a
grand
festa
ashore
and
there
be
to
be
a
gala
performance
at
the
theater
,
Leithcourt
take
a
box
and
the
whole
party
be
row
ashore
.
<EOS>
the
crew
be
also
give
shore
-
leave
for
the
evening
,
but
as
the
great
heat
have
upset
me
<EOS>
I
decline
to
accompany
the
theater
-
party
,
and
remain
on
board
with
one
sailor
name
Wilson
to
constitute
the
watch
.
<EOS>
We
have
anchor
about
half
a
mile
from
land
,
and
earlier
in
the
evening
the
Baron
have
go
ashore
to
send
telegram
to
Russia
,
and
have
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
about
ten
o'clock
I
go
below
to
try
and
sleep
,
but
I
have
a
slight
attack
of
fever
,
and
be
unable
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
redress
and
sit
with
the
light
still
out
,
gaze
across
the
starlit
bay
.
<EOS>
presently
from
my
port
-
hole
I
see
a
shore
-
boat
approach
,
and
recognize
in
it
the
Baron
with
a
well
-
dress
stranger
.
<EOS>
They
both
come
on
board
,
and
the
boatman
,
have
be
pay
,
pull
back
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
then
the
Baron
and
his
friend
--
a
dark
,
middle
-
aged
,
full
-
bearded
man
,
evidently
a
person
of
refinement
--
go
below
to
the
saloon
,
and
after
a
few
moment
call
to
the
man
Wilson
who
be
on
the
watch
,
and
give
him
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
,
which
he
take
up
on
deck
to
drink
at
his
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
unusual
character
of
my
fellow
-
guest
on
board
that
craft
be
such
that
my
suspicion
be
constantly
on
the
alert
,
therefore
curiosity
tempt
me
to
creep
along
and
peep
in
at
the
crack
of
the
door
stand
ajar
.
<EOS>
a
close
view
reveal
the
fact
that
the
stranger
be
a
high
russian
official
to
whom
I
have
once
be
introduce
at
the
Government
Palace
at
Helsingfors
,
the
Privy
-
Councillor
and
Senator
Paul
Polovstoff
.
<EOS>
They
be
smoke
together
,
and
be
discuss
in
Russian
the
mean
by
which
he
,
Polovstoff
,
have
arrange
to
obtain
plan
of
some
new
british
fortification
at
Gibraltar
.
<EOS>
from
what
he
say
,
it
seem
that
some
russian
woman
,
marry
to
an
Englishman
,
a
captain
in
the
garrison
,
have
be
impress
into
the
secret
service
against
her
will
,
but
that
she
have
,
in
order
to
save
herself
,
promise
to
obtain
the
photograph
and
plan
that
be
require
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Englishman
's
name
,
and
I
resolve
to
take
some
step
to
inform
him
in
secret
of
the
intention
of
the
russian
agent
.
 
<EOS>
"
presently
the
two
man
take
fresh
cigar
,
ascend
on
deck
,
and
cast
themselves
in
the
long
cane
chair
amidship
.
<EOS>
still
all
curiosity
to
hear
further
detail
on
the
ingenious
piece
of
espionage
against
my
own
nation
,
I
take
off
my
shoe
and
creep
up
to
a
spot
where
I
could
crouch
conceal
and
overhear
their
conversation
,
for
the
italian
night
be
calm
and
still
.
<EOS>
They
talk
mainly
about
affair
in
Finland
,
and
with
some
of
Oberg
's
expression
of
opinion
Polovstoff
venture
to
differ
.
<EOS>
this
arouse
the
Baron
's
anger
,
and
I
know
from
the
cold
sarcasm
of
his
remark
,
and
the
peculiarly
hard
tone
of
his
voice
,
that
he
be
more
incensed
than
he
outwardly
show
himself
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
rise
and
stand
with
his
back
to
the
bulwark
face
his
friend
,
who
still
sit
lean
back
in
his
deck
-
chair
insist
upon
his
own
view
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
calm
,
and
not
in
the
least
perturb
by
the
evil
glint
in
the
Baron
's
eye
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
do
not
know
him
so
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
what
that
look
mean
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
while
the
Privy
-
Councillor
lie
back
in
his
chair
pull
thoughtfully
at
his
cigar
,
there
be
a
bright
,
blood
-
red
flash
,
a
dull
report
,
and
a
man
's
short
agonized
cry
.
<EOS>
startle
,
I
lean
around
the
corner
of
the
deck
-
house
,
when
,
to
my
abject
horror
,
I
see
under
the
electric
ray
the
Czar
's
Privy
-
Councillor
lie
sideways
in
his
chair
with
part
of
his
face
blow
away
.
<EOS>
then
the
hideous
truth
in
an
instant
become
apparent
.
<EOS>
the
cigar
which
Oberg
have
press
upon
him
down
in
the
saloon
have
explode
,
and
the
small
missile
conceal
inside
the
diabolical
contrivance
have
pass
upward
into
his
brain
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
I
stand
utterly
stupefy
,
yet
as
I
look
<EOS>
I
see
the
Baron
,
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
,
shake
his
fist
in
the
dead
man
's
face
,
and
cry
with
a
fearful
imprecation
:
'
<EOS>
You
hound
!
<EOS>
You
have
plot
to
replace
me
in
the
Czar
's
favor
.
<EOS>
You
intend
to
become
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
!
<EOS>
You
know
certain
fact
which
you
intend
to
put
before
his
Majesty
,
know
that
the
revelation
would
result
in
my
disgrace
and
downfall
.
<EOS>
but
,
you
infernal
cur
,
you
do
not
know
that
those
who
attempt
to
thwart
Xavier
Oberg
either
die
by
accident
or
go
for
life
to
Kajana
or
the
mine
!
'
<EOS>
and
he
spurn
the
body
with
his
foot
and
laugh
to
himself
as
he
gloat
over
his
dastardly
crime
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
watch
his
rage
,
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
after
he
have
search
the
dead
man
's
pocket
,
raise
the
inert
body
with
its
awful
featureless
face
and
drag
it
to
the
bulwark
.
<EOS>
then
I
rush
forward
and
face
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
an
instant
he
spring
at
me
,
and
I
scream
.
<EOS>
but
no
aid
come
.
<EOS>
the
man
Wilson
be
sleep
soundly
in
the
bow
,
for
the
whisky
he
have
give
him

be
doctor
,
"
go
on
the
narrative

<EOS>
"
upon
his
face
be
a
fierce
,
murderous
look
such
as
I
have
never
see
before
.
'
You
!
'
<EOS>
he
scream
,
his
dark
eye
start
from
their
socket
as
he
realize
that
I
have
be
a
witness
of
his
cowardly
crime
.
'
<EOS>
You

<EOS>
he
hiss
,
'
and
you
shall
die
also

<EOS>
I
sink
upon
my
knee
implore
him
to
spare
me
,
but
he
only
laugh
at
my
entreaty
.
'

'
<EOS>
he
cry
,
'
as
you
see
how
he
enjoy
his
cigar
,

may
as
well

'
<EOS>
and
with
an
effort
he
raise
the
dead
body
in
his
arm
,
poise
it
for
a
moment
on
the
vessel
's
side
,
and
then
,
with
a
hoarse
laugh
of
triumph
,
heave
it
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
splash
,
and
then
we
be
alone
.
'
<EOS>
and
you
!
'
<EOS>
he
cry
in
a
fierce
voice--'you
who
have
spy
upon
me
--
you
will
follow
!
<EOS>
the
water
there
will
close
your
chatter
mouth

'
<EOS>
I
shriek
,
beg
,
and
implore
,
but
his
tremble
hand
be
upon
my
throat
.
<EOS>
first
he
drag
me
to
my
foot
,
then
he
throw
me
upon
my
knee
,
and
at
last
,
with
that
grim
brutality
which
characterize
him
,
he
direct
me
to
go
and
get
a
mop
and
bucket
from
the
forecastle
and
remove
the
dark
red
stain
from
the
chair

this
he
actually
force
me
to
do
,
gloat
over
my
horror
as
I
remove
for
him
the
trace
of
his
cowardly
crime
.
<EOS>
then
,
with
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
he
say
,
'
Girl
!
<EOS>
recollect
that
you
keep
to

night

work

<EOS>
if
not

you
shall
die
a
death
more
painful

one
in

you
shall
experience
all

torture

<EOS>
recollect

not

or
death

<EOS>
now
,
go
to
your
cabin
,
and
never
pry
into
my
affair
again

'
 
<EOS>
"
I
go
back
to
my
cabin
as
I
be
bid
,
and
sit
speechless
in
abject
horror
.
<EOS>
the
fiendish
action
of
the
man
who
be
my
guardian
frighten
me
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
utterly
helpless
.
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
who
in
holy
Russia
would
hear
me
?
<EOS>
Oberg
be
a
power
in
the
Empire
;
the
Czar
himself
trust
him
.
<EOS>
if
I
speak
,
who
would
believe
me
;
who
would
heed
the
word
of
a
defenseless
girl
whom
he
would
at
once
declare
to
be
hysterical
?
<EOS>
thus
I
wait
alone
in
the
darkness
,
watch
the
light
of
the
port
gleam
across
the
placid
water
until
nearly
one
o'clock
,
when
the
gay
party
return
,
and
the
Baron
greet
them
merrily
as
though
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
but
my
heart
be
freeze
within
me
by
the
recollection
of
the
awful
crime
that
have
be
commit

Muriel

amazed

<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
night
quite
well
,
how
white
you
be
when
you
come
to
my
cabin
and
ask
to
be
allow
to
sleep

You
would
tell

nothing

none

any

course

at
his

that

at
his

utterly
amazed

strange

It
be
a
plain

by

<EOS>
Elma
point
to
the
paper
,
and
make
a
sign
that
I
be
to
read
on
.
<EOS>
this
I
do
,
and
the
statement
run
as
follow
:
 
<EOS>
"
the
real
reason
why
the
Baron
spare
my
life
be
because
,
if
I
die
,
my
fortune
would
pass
to
a
distant
cousin

at
Durham
.
<EOS>
yet
his
manner
towards
me
be
now
most
polite
and
pleasant
--
a
change
that
I
feel
boded
no
good

<EOS>
He
intend
to
obtain
my
money
by
marry
me
to
his
son
Michael

whose
evil
reputation
as

be
well

<EOS>
We

back
to

in

autumn

and
in
the
winter
he
take
me
to
stay
with
his
sister
in
Nice
.
<EOS>
yet
almost
daily
he
refer
to
that
tragedy
at
Naples
,
and
threaten
me
with
death
if
ever
I
utter
a
single
word

last
June
,
"
commence
another
paragraph
,
"
we
be
in
Helsingfors
,
when
one
day
the
Baron
call
me
suddenly
and
tell
me
to
prepare
for
a
journey
.
<EOS>
We
be
to
cross
to
Stockholm
and
thence
to
Hull
,
where
the
_
Iris

be
await
us
,
for
Mr.
Leithcourt
and
Muriel
have
invite
us
for
a
summer
cruise
to
the
Greek
Islands
.
<EOS>
We
board
the
yacht
much
against
my
will
,
yet
I
be
powerless
,
and
dare
not
allege
the
fact
that
I
have
already
establish
concern
our
fellow

guest
.
<EOS>
Muriel
and
I
,
it
seem
,
be
take
merely
in
order
to
blind
the
shore
-
guard
and
Customs
official
as
to
the
real
nature
of
the
vessel
,
which
when
safely
out
of
the
Channel
,
be
repaint
and
rename
the
_
Lola
_
,
until
her
exterior
present
quite
a
different
appearance
from
the
_
Iris
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
port
of
Leghorn
be
our
first
place
of
call
,
and
for
some
reason
we
run
purposely
upon
a
sandbank
and
be
tow
off
by
italian
torpedo
-
boat
.
<EOS>
next
evening
you
come
on
board
and
dine
,
Muriel
and
myself
have
strict
order
not
to
show
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
,
however
,
watch
you
,
and
I
see
you
pick
up
my
photograph
<EOS>
which
I
have
that
day
tear
up
.
<EOS>
then
immediately
after
you
have
leave
,
Woodroffe
,
Chater
and
Mackintosh
go
ashore
and
be
away
a
couple
of
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
just
before
they
return
the
Baron
rap
at
the
door
of
my
cabin
say
that
he
must
go
ashore
,
and
tell
me
to
dress
and
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
allow
me
the
luxury
of
a
maid
,
fearing
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
may
learn
too
much
.
<EOS>
in
obedience
I
rise
and
dress
,
and
when
I
go
forth
he
tell
me
to
get
my
traveling
-
cloak
and
dressing
-
bag
,
add
that
he
be
compel
to
go
north
,
as
to
continue
the
cruise
would
occupy
too
much
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
due
back
at
his
official
duty
,
he
say
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
finish
pack
,
the
three
man
return
to
the
vessel
,
all
of
them
look
dark
-
faced
and
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
whisper
some
word
to
the
Baron
,
after
which
I
go
to
Muriel
's
cabin
and
wish
her
good
-
bye
,
and
we
go
ashore
,
take
the
train
first
to
Colle
Salvetti
,
thence
to
Pisa
,
and
afterwards
to
the
beautiful
old
city
of
Siena
,
which
I
have
so
long
to
see
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
tooth
give
me
pain
,
and
the
Baron
,
after
a
couple
of
day
at
the
Hotel
de
Sienne
,
take
me
to
a
queer
-
look
little
old
italian
--
a
dentist
who
,
he
say
,
enjoy
an
excellent
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
be
quick
to
notice
that
the
two
man
have
meet
before
,
and
as
I
sit
in
the
chair
and
gas
be
give
to
me
<EOS>
I
see
them
exchange
meaning
glance
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
I
become
insensible
,
but
when
I
awake
an
hour
later
I
be
astounded
to
feel
a
curious
soreness
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
My
tongue
,
too
,
seem
paralyzed
,
and
in
a
few
moment
the
awful
truth
dawn
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
render
deaf
and
dumb
!
 
<EOS>
"
the
Baron
pretend
to
be
greatly
concerned
about
me
,
"
it
go
on
,
"
but
I
quickly
realize
that
I
have
be
the
victim
of
a
foul
and
dastardly
plot
,
and
that
he
have
conceive
it
,
fear
lest
I
may
speak
the
truth
concern
the
Privy
-
Councillor
Polovstoff
,
for
of
exposure
he
live
in
constant
fear
.
<EOS>
to
encompass
my
end
would
be
against
his
own
interest
,
as
he
would
lose
my
fortune
,
so
he
have
silence
me
lest
I
should
reveal
the
terrible
truth
concern
both
him
and
his
associate
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
rich
,
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
from
time
to
time
he
give
information
as
to
person
who
possess
valuable
jewel
,
and
thus
share
in
the
plunder
obtain
by
those
on
the
yacht
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
Italy
we
travel
on
to
Berlin
,
thence
to
Petersburg
,
and
back
to
dreary
Helsingfors
,
journey
as
quickly
as
we
could
,
yet
never
allow
me
opportunity
of
be
with
stranger
.
<EOS>
both
my
ear
and
tongue
be
very
painful
,
but
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
be
surely
a
fiend
in
a
black
coat
,
and
my
only
think
now
be
how
to
escape
him
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
when
that
so
-
call
dentist
have
ruin
my
hearing
and
deprive
me
of
power
of
speech
,
he
keep
me
aloof
from
everyone
.
<EOS>
the
fear
that
I
should
reveal
everything
have
apparently
grow
to
haunt
him
,
and
he
have
conceive
that
terrible
mode
of
silence
my
lip
.
<EOS>
but
the
true
depth
of
his
villainy
be
not
yet
apparent
until
I
be
back
in
Finland
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
he
call
in
his
son
,
who
have
travel
with
us
from
Petersburg
,
and
in
writing
again
demand
that
I
should
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
write
my
reply
--
a
firm
refusal
.
<EOS>
He
strike
the
table
angrily
with
his
fist
and
write
say
that
I
should
either
marry
his
son
or
die
.
<EOS>
then
next
day
,
while
walk
alone
out
beyond
the
town
of
Helsingfors
,
as
I
often
use
to
do
,
I
be
arrest
upon
the
false
charge
of
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
Madame
Vakuroff
and
transport
,
without
trial
,
to
the
terrible
fortress
of
Kajana
,
some
of
the
horror
of
which
you
have
yourself
experience
.
<EOS>
the
charge
against
me
be
necessary
before
I
could
be
incarcerate
there
,
but
once
within
,
it
be
the
scheme
of
the
Governor
-
General
to
obtain
my
consent
to
the
marriage
by
threat
and
by
the
constant
terror
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
even
go
so
far
as
to
obtain
a
ministerial
order
for
my
banishment
to
Saghalien
and
bring
it
to
me
to
Kajana
,
declare
that
if
in
one
month
I
do
not
consent
he
should
allow
me
to
be
send
to
exile
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
in
Kajana
he
know
that
his
secret
be
safe
,
therefore
by
every
mean
in
his
power
he
urge
me
to
consent
to
the
odious
union
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
the
rest
be
know
to
you
--
how
Providence
direct
you
to
me
as
my
deliverer
,
and
how
Woodroffe
follow
you
in
secret
,
and
pretend
to
be
my
friend
take
me
with
him
to
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
of
my
fortune
from
the
Baron
,
and
intend
to
marry
me
himself
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
all
be
over
it
appear
to
me
like
some
terrible
dream
.
<EOS>
I
never
believe
that
so
much
iniquity
exist
in
the
world
,
or
that
man
could
fight
a
defenseless
woman
with
such
double
-
deal
and
cruel
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
the
torture
I
endure
in
Kajana
be
beyond
human
conception
.
<EOS>
yet
surely
Oberg
and
Woodroffe
will
obtain
their
well
-
merit
desert
--
if
not
in
this
world
,
then
in
the
world
to
come

by
Holy
Writ

minded

CONCLUSION
  
nearly
two
year
have
now
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
change
in
holy
Russia
--
many
great
and
amazing
change
consequent
upon
war
and
its
disaster
.
<EOS>
Russia
be
no
longer
the
great
power
that
she
once
be
suppose
to
be
.
<EOS>
many
event
that
have
startle
the
world
have
occur
since
that
day
when
I
first
enfold
my
silent
love
within
my
arm
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
know
to
you
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
read
in
the
newspaper
,
without
a
doubt
,
how
the
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
,
the
persecutor
of
Finland
,
the
enemy
of
education
,
the
relentless
foe
of
the
defenseless
,
the
man
who
order
woman
to
be
knoute
to
death
in
Kajana
,
the
heartless
official
whom
the
Finns
call
"
The
Strangler
,
"
be
blow
to
piece
by
a
bomb
throw
beneath
his
carriage
as
he
drive
to
the
railway
station
at
Helsingfors
on
his
way
to
have
audience
with
the
Emperor
.
 
<EOS>
the
secret
truth
be
that
the
"
Red
Priest
"
decree
that
Oberg
should
die
,
and
the
plot
be
swiftly
put
into
execution
,
and
although
five
hundred
arrest
be
make
the
police
be
unaware
to
this
day
of
the
identity
of
the
person
who
direct
it
,
or
of
who
throw
the
fatal
missile
.
<EOS>
from
pillar
to
post
the
revolutionist
have
be
hunt
by
the
bloodhound
of
police
,
yet
the
"
Red
Priest
"
still
live
on
quietly
in
Petersburg
,
and
the
Princess
Zurloff
,
still
unsuspected
,
devote
the
great
part
of
her
enormous
income
to
the
cause
of
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
of
Jack
and
Muriel
<EOS>
I
need
<EOS>
only
say
they
be
marry
about
three
month
after
Elma
's
return
from
Russia
,
and
at
the
present
time
they
be
live
on
the
outskirt
of
Glasgow
,
where
Jack
have
secure
the
shore
appointment
which
he
so
long
coveted
.
 
<EOS>
by
some
mean
--
exactly
how
be
not
quite
certain
--
the
police
discover
that
Dick
Archer
,
alias
Woodroffe
,
alias
Hornby
,
be
concern
in
the
clever
robbery
of
a
dressing
-
bag
,
contain
the
Dowager
Lady
Lancashire
's
jewel
,
from
her
footman
on
Euston
platform
,
and
after
a
long
search
they
find
him
hide
at
an
hotel
in
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
they
go
to
arrest
him
,
he
laugh
in
the
face
of
the
detective
,
place
something
swiftly
in
his
mouth
and
swallow
it
before
they
could
prevent
him
--
then
ten
minute
later
he
fall
dead
.
<EOS>
He
know
what
terrible
revelation
must
be
make
if
we
give
evidence
against
him
,
and
he
therefore
prefer
death
by
his
own
hand
to
that
follow
a
judicial
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
Chater
,
although
one
of
the
most
expert
jewel
thief
in
Europe
,
have
never
be
actually
guilty
of
any
graver
offense
,
and
when
we
hear
that
he
be
in
San
Francisco
,
where
he
have
open
a
small
bar
and
be
try
to
live
honestly
,
we
resolve
to
allow
him
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Jack
write
to
him
about
nine
month
ago
warn
him
never
to
set
foot
on
english
soil
again
on
pain
of
arrest
.

It

all
I
can

<EOS>
My
proposal
of
marriage

make
to
Elma
a
very
few
day
after
she
write
down
her
startling

romantic
story

be
extend
,
and
she
be
release
from
that
far
-
off
arctic
prison
to
which
she
have
be
send
with
such
cruel
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
the
great
London
specialist
have
continually
treat
my
dear
wife
,
and
under
them
she
have
already
recover
her
speech
--
so
far
,
indeed
,
that
she
can
now
whisper
in
a
low
,
soft
voice
.
<EOS>
but
they
tell
me
they
be
hopeful
that
ere
<EOS>
long
her
voice
will
become
strong
,
and
speech
practically
restore
.
<EOS>
already
,
too
,
she
can
begin
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
the
storm
and
peril
of
the
past
,
our
life
be
now
indeed
full
of
a
calm
,
sweet
peace
.
<EOS>
in
our
own
comfortable
little
house
,
with
its
trellised
porch
cover
with
rose
and
honeysuckle
,
that
face
the
blue
Channel
at
St.
Margaret
's
Bay
,
beyond
Dover
,
we
lead
a
life
of
mutual
trust
and
boundless
love
.
<EOS>
We
be
supremely
content
--
the
happy
pair
in
all
the
world
,
we
think
.
 
<EOS>
often
as
we
sit
together
at
evening
,
gaze
out
upon
the
great
ship
pass
darkly
away
into
the
mysterious
afterglow
,
our
hand
clasp
mutually
in
a
silence
more
eloquent
than
word
,
and
as
we
gaze
into
each
other
's
eye
there
occur
to
us
the
Divine
injunction
:
"
<EOS>
WHOM
GOD
HATH
JOINED
,
let
no
MAN
PUT
ASUNDER
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
end
