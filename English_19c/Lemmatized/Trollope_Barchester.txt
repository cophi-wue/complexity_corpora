 
<EOS>
who
Will
be
the
New
Bishop
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
latter
day
of
July
in
the
year
185
 
,
a
most
important
question
be
for
ten
day
hourly
ask
in
the
cathedral
city
of
Barchester
,
and
answer
every
hour
in
various
way
 
who
be
to
be
the
new
bishop
?
  
<EOS>
the
death
of
old
Dr.
Grantly
,
who
have
for
many
year
fill
that
chair
with
meek
authority
,
take
place
exactly
as
the
ministry
of
Lord
 
---
be
go
to
give
place
to
that
of
Lord
 
---
.
<EOS>
the
illness
of
the
good
old
man
be
long
and
linger
,
and
it
become
at
last
a
matter
of
intense
interest
to
those
concern
whether
the
new
appointment
should
be
make
by
a
conservative
or
liberal
government
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
well
understand
that
the
outgoing
premier
have
make
his
selection
and
that
if
the
question
rest
with
him
,
the
mitre
would
descend
on
the
head
of
Archdeacon
<EOS>
Grantly
,
the
old
bishop
's
son
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
long
manage
the
affair
of
the
diocese
,
and
for
some
month
previous
to
the
demise
of
his
father
rumour
have
confidently
assign
to
him
the
reversion
of
his
father
's
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Bishop
Grantly
die
as
he
have
live
,
peaceably
,
slowly
,
without
pain
and
without
excitement
.
<EOS>
the
breath
ebb
from
him
almost
imperceptibly
,
and
for
a
month
before
his
death
it
be
a
question
whether
he
be
alive
or
dead
.
  
<EOS>
a
try
time
be
this
for
the
archdeacon
,
for
whom
be
design
the
reversion
of
his
father
's
see
by
those
who
then
have
the
giving
away
of
episcopal
throne
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
understand
to
say
that
the
prime
minister
have
in
so
many
word
promise
the
bishopric
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
discreet
a
man
for
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
proverb
with
reference
to
the
killing
of
cat
,
and
those
who
know
anything
either
of
high
or
low
government
place
will
be
well
aware
that
a
promise
may
be
make
without
positive
word
and
that
an
expectant
may
be
put
into
the
high
state
of
encouragement
,
though
the
great
man
on
whose
breath
<EOS>
he
hang
may
have
do
no
more
than
whisper
that
"
Mr.
So
-
and
-
so
be
certainly
a
rise
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
a
whisper
have
be
make
,
and
be
know
by
those
who
hear
it
to
signify
that
the
cure
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
should
not
be
take
out
of
the
hand
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
the
then
prime
minister
be
all
in
all
at
Oxford
,
and
have
lately
pass
a
night
at
the
house
of
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
<EOS>
now
the
Master
of
Lazarus
 
which
be
,
by
the
by
,
in
many
respect
the
most
comfortable
as
well
as
the
rich
college
at
Oxford
 
be
the
archdeacon
's
most
intimate
friend
and
most
trusted
counsellor
.
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of
the
prime
minister
's
visit
,
Dr.
Grantly
be
of
course
present
,
and
the
meeting
be
very
gracious
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
Dr.
Gwynne
,
the
master
,
tell
the
archdeacon
that
in
his
opinion
the
thing
be
settle
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
bishop
be
quite
on
his
last
leg
;
but
the
ministry
also
be
totter
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
return
from
Oxford
,
happy
and
elated
,
to
resume
his
place
in
the
palace
and
to
continue
to
perform
for
the
father
the
last
duty
of
a
son
,
which
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
perform
with
more
tender
care
than
be
to
be
expect
from
his
usual
somewhat
worldly
manner
.
  
<EOS>
a
month
since
,
the
physician
have
name
four
week
as
the
outside
period
during
which
breath
could
be
support
within
the
body
of
the
die
man
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
physician
wonder
,
and
name
another
fortnight
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
live
on
wine
alone
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
still
live
,
and
the
tiding
of
the
fall
of
the
ministry
become
more
frequent
.
<EOS>
Sir
Lamda
Mewnew
and
Sir
Omicron
Pie
,
the
two
great
London
doctor
,
now
come
down
for
the
fifth
time
and
declare
,
shake
their
learn
head
,
that
another
week
of
life
be
impossible
;
and
as
they
sit
down
to
lunch
in
the
episcopal
dining
-
room
,
whisper
to
the
archdeacon
their
own
private
knowledge
that
the
ministry
must
fall
within
five
day
.
<EOS>
the
son
return
to
his
father
's
room
and
,
after
administer
with
his
own
hand
the
sustain
modicum
of
madeira
,
sit
down
by
the
bedside
to
calculate
his
chance
.
  
<EOS>
the
ministry
be
to
be
out
within
five
day
:
his
father
be
to
be
dead
within
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
reject
that
view
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
ministry
be
to
be
out
,
and
the
diocese
may
probably
be
vacant
at
the
same
period
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
doubt
as
to
the
name
of
the
man
who
be
to
succeed
to
power
,
and
a
week
must
elapse
before
a
cabinet
be
form
.
<EOS>
Would
not
vacancy
be
fill
by
the
outgoing
man
during
this
week
?
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
have
a
kind
of
idea
that
such
would
be
the
case
but
do
not
know
,
and
then
he
wonder
at
his
own
ignorance
on
such
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
He
try
to
keep
his
mind
away
from
the
subject
,
but
he
could
not
.
<EOS>
the
race
be
so
very
close
,
and
the
stake
be
so
very
high
.
<EOS>
He
then
look
at
the
die
man
's
impassive
,
placid
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
there
of
death
or
disease
;
it
be
something
thin
than
of
yore
,
somewhat
grayer
,
and
the
deep
line
of
age
more
marked
;
but
,
as
far
as
he
could
judge
,
life
may
yet
hang
there
for
week
to
come
.
<EOS>
Sir
Lamda
Mewnew
and
Sir
Omicron
Pie
have
thrice
be
wrong
,
and
may
yet
be
wrong
thrice
again
.
<EOS>
the
old
bishop
sleep
during
twenty
of
the
twenty
-
four
hour
,
but
during
the
short
period
of
his
wake
moment
,
he
know
both
his
son
and
his
dear
old
friend
,
Mr.
Harding
,
the
archdeacon
's
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
would
thank
them
tenderly
for
their
care
and
love
.
<EOS>
now
he
lie
sleep
like
a
baby
,
rest
easily
on
his
back
,
his
mouth
just
open
,
and
his
few
gray
hair
straggle
from
beneath
his
cap
;
his
breath
be
perfectly
noiseless
,
and
his
thin
,
wan
hand
,
which
lie
above
the
coverlid
,
never
move
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
easy
than
the
old
man
's
passage
from
this
world
to
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
no
means
easy
be
the
emotion
of
him
who
sit
there
watch
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
must
be
now
or
never
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
over
fifty
,
and
there
be
little
chance
that
his
friend
who
be
now
leave
office
would
soon
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
no
probable
british
prime
minister
but
he
who
be
now
in
,
he
who
be
so
soon
to
be
out
,
would
think
of
make
a
bishop
of
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
thus
he
think
long
and
sadly
,
in
deep
silence
,
and
then
gaze
at
that
still
live
face
,
and
then
at
last
dare
to
ask
himself
whether
he
really
long
for
his
father
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
effort
be
a
salutary
one
,
and
the
question
be
answer
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
the
proud
,
wishful
,
worldly
man
sink
on
his
knee
by
the
bedside
and
,
take
the
bishop
's
hand
within
his
own
,
pray
eagerly
that
his
sin
may
be
forgive
him
.
  
<EOS>
His
face
be
still
bury
in
the
clothe
when
the
door
of
the
bedroom
open
noiselessly
and
Mr.
Harding
enter
with
a
velvet
step
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
's
attendance
at
that
bedside
have
be
nearly
as
constant
as
that
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
his
ingress
and
egress
be
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
that
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
be
stand
close
beside
the
archdeacon
before
he
be
perceive
,
and
would
also
have
kneel
in
prayer
have
he
not
fear
that
his
do
so
may
have
cause
some
sudden
start
and
have
disturb
the
die
man
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
however
,
instantly
perceive
him
and
rise
from
his
knee
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
Mr.
Harding
take
both
his
hand
and
press
them
warmly
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
fellowship
between
them
at
that
moment
than
there
have
ever
be
before
,
and
it
so
happen
that
after
circumstance
greatly
preserve
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
as
they
stand
there
press
each
other
's
hand
,
the
tear
roll
freely
down
their
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
bishop
with
feeble
voice
as
he
wake
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
 
<EOS>
may
God
bless
you
both
,
my
dear
child
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
die
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
loud
rattle
in
the
throat
,
no
dreadful
struggle
,
no
palpable
sign
of
death
,
but
the
low
jaw
fall
a
little
from
its
place
,
and
the
eye
which
have
be
so
constantly
close
in
sleep
now
remain
fix
and
open
.
<EOS>
neither
Mr.
Harding
nor
Dr.
Grantly
know
that
life
be
go
,
though
both
suspect
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
be
all
over
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
still
press
the
other
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
 
nay
,
I
hope
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ring
the
bell
,
"
say
the
other
,
speak
all
but
in
a
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Phillips
should
be
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Phillips
,
the
nurse
,
be
soon
in
the
room
,
and
immediately
,
with
practised
hand
,
close
those
stare
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
over
,
Mrs.
Phillips
?
"
ask
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
be
no
more
,
"
say
Mrs.
Phillips
,
turn
round
and
curtsey
low
with
solemn
face
;
"
his
lordship
be
go
more
like
a
sleep
babby
than
any
that
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
relief
,
Archdeacon
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
"
a
great
relief
 
dear
,
good
,
excellent
old
man
.
<EOS>
oh
that
our
last
moment
may
be
as
innocent
and
as
peaceful
as
his
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"
say
Mrs.
Phillips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Lord
be
praise
for
all
his
mercy
;
but
,
for
a
meek
,
mild
,
gentle
-
spoken
Christian
,
his
lordship
be
 
"
and
Mrs.
Phillips
,
with
unaffected
but
easy
grief
,
put
up
her
white
apron
to
her
flow
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
but
rejoice
that
it
be
over
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
still
console
his
friend
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
mind
,
however
,
have
already
travel
from
the
death
chamber
to
the
closet
of
the
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
He
have
bring
himself
to
pray
for
his
father
's
life
,
but
now
that
that
life
be
do
,
minute
be
too
precious
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
useless
to
dally
with
the
fact
of
the
bishop
's
death
 
useless
to
lose
perhaps
everything
for
the
pretence
of
a
foolish
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
act
while
his
father
-
in
-
law
stand
there
hold
his
hand
?
<EOS>
how
,
without
appear
unfeeling
,
be
he
to
forget
his
father
in
the
bishop
 
to
overlook
what
he
have
lose
,
and
think
only
of
what
he
may
possibly
gain
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
suppose
not
,
"
say
he
,
at
last
,
in
answer
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
expect
it
so
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
take
him
by
the
arm
and
lead
him
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
him
again
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
say
he
;
"
we
have
better
leave
the
room
now
to
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
they
go
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
already
evening
and
nearly
dark
.
<EOS>
It
be
most
important
that
the
prime
minister
should
know
that
night
that
the
diocese
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
everything
may
depend
on
it
;
and
so
,
in
answer
to
Mr.
Harding
's
further
consolation
,
the
archdeacon
suggest
that
a
telegraph
message
should
be
immediately
send
off
to
London
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
who
have
really
be
somewhat
surprised
to
find
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
as
he
think
,
so
much
affected
,
be
rather
take
aback
,
but
he
make
no
objection
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
archdeacon
have
some
hope
of
succeed
to
his
father
's
place
,
though
he
by
no
mean
know
how
highly
raise
that
hope
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Dr.
Grantly
,
collect
himself
and
shake
off
his
weakness
,
"
we
must
send
a
message
at
once
;
we
do
not
know
what
may
be
the
consequence
of
delay
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
I
!
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
anything
,
only
I
do
not
know
exactly
what
it
be
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
sit
down
before
a
writing
-
table
and
,
take
pen
and
ink
,
write
on
a
slip
of
paper
as
follow
:
    
by
Electric
Telegraph
.
<EOS>
for
the
Earl
of
 
---
,
Downing
Street
,
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
be
dead
.
<EOS>
message
send
by
the
Rev.
Septimus
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
take
that
to
the
telegraph
office
at
the
railway
station
and
give
it
in
as
it
be
<EOS>
;
they
will
probably
make
you
copy
it
on
to
one
of
their
own
slip
;
that
be
all
you
will
have
to
do
;
then
you
will
have
to
pay
them
half
a
crown
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
archdeacon
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pull
out
the
necessary
sum
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
feel
very
much
like
an
errand
-
boy
,
and
also
feel
that
he
be
call
on
to
perform
his
duty
as
such
at
rather
an
unseemly
time
,
but
he
say
nothing
,
and
take
the
slip
of
paper
and
the
proffer
coin
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
put
my
name
into
it
,
Archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
other
,
"

<EOS>
We
must
beg
to
be
allow
to
draw
a
curtain
over
the
sorrow
of
the
archdeacon
as
he
sit
,
sombre
and
sad
at
heart
,
in
the
study
of
his
parsonage
at
Plumstead
Episcopi

on
the
day
subsequent
to

dispatch
of

message
he
hear
that
the
Earl

have
consent
to
undertake
the
formation
of
a
ministry
,
and
from
that
moment
he
know
that
his
chance
be
over
.
<EOS>
many
will
think
that
he
be
wicked
to
grieve
for
the
loss
of
episcopal
power
,
wicked
to
have
covet
it
,
nay
,
wicke
even
to
have
think
about
it
,
in
the
way
and
at
the
moment
he
have
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
censure
I
can
not
profess
that
I
completely
agree
.
<EOS>
the
_
nolo
episcopari
_
,
though
still
in
use
,
be
so
directly
at
variance
with
the
tendency
of
all
human
wish
,
that
it
can
not
be
think
to
express
the
true
aspiration
of
rise
priest
in
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
a
lawyer
do
not
sin
in
seek
to
be
a
judge
,
or
in
compass
his
wish
by
all
honest
mean
.
<EOS>
a
young
diplomat
entertain
a
fair
ambition
when
he
look
forward
to
be
the
lord
of
a
first

rate
embassy

a
poor

,
when
he
attempt

rival
Dickens

rise
above

commit
no
fault

though
he
may

foolish

<EOS>
Sydney
Smith
truly
say
that
in
these
recreant
day
we
can
not
expect
to
find
the
majesty
of
St.
Paul
beneath
the
cassock
of
a
curate
.
<EOS>
if
we
look
to
our
clergyman
to
be
more
than
man
,
we
shall
probably
teach
ourselves
to
think
that
they
be
less
,
and
can
hardly
hope
to
raise
the
character
of
the
pastor
by
deny
to
him
the
right
to
entertain
the
aspiration
of
a
man

<EOS>
Our
archdeacon
be
worldly
 
who
among
us
be
not
so
?
<EOS>
He
be
ambitious
 
who
among
us
be
ashamed
to
own
that
"
last
infirmity
of
noble
mind
!
"
<EOS>
He
be
avaricious
,
my
reader
will
say
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
it
be
for
no
love
of
lucre
that
he
wish
to
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
be
his
father
's
only
child
,
and
his
father
have
leave
him
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
His
preferment
bring
him
in
nearly
three
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
the
bishopric
,
as
cut
down
by
the
Ecclesiastical
Commission
,
be
only
five
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
rich
man
as
archdeacon
than
he
could
be
as
bishop
.
<EOS>
but
he
certainly
do
desire
to
play
first
fiddle
;
he
do
desire
to
sit
in
full
lawn
sleeve
among
the
peer
of
the
realm
;
and
he
do
desire
,
if
the
truth
must
out
,
to
be
call
"
My
lord
"
by
his
reverend
brother
.
  
<EOS>
His
hope
,
however
,
be
they
innocent

sinful

be
not
fate

be
realize

be
consecrate
Bishop

<EOS>
Hiram
's
Hospital
<EOS>
accord
to
Act
of
Parliament
 
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
that
I
should
here
give
to
the
public
any
lengthen
biography
of
Mr.
Harding
up
to
the
period
of
the
commencement
of
this
tale
.
<EOS>
the
public
can
not
have
forget
how
ill
that
sensitive
gentleman
bear
the
attack
that
be
make
on
him
in
the
column
of
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
with
reference
to
the
income
which
he
receive
as
warden
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
,
in
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
nor
can
it
yet
be
forget
that
a
lawsuit
be
institute
against
him
on
the
matter
of
that
charity
by
Mr.
John
Bold
,
who
afterwards
marry
his
,
Mr.
Harding
's
,
young
and
then
only
unmarried
daughter
.
<EOS>
under
pressure
of
these
attack
,
Mr.
Harding
have
resign
his
wardenship
,
though
strongly
recommend
to
abstain
from
do
so
both
by
his
friend
and
by
his
lawyer
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
however
,
resign
it
,
and
betook
himself
manfully
to
the
duty
of
the
small
parish
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
,
in
the
city
,
of
which
he
be
vicar
,
continue
also
to
perform
those
of
precentor
of
the
cathedral
,
a
situation
of
small
emolument
which
have
hitherto
be
suppose
to
be
join
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
above
speak
of
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
leave
the
hospital
from
which
he
have
be
so
ruthlessly
drive
,
and
settle
himself
down
in
his
own
modest
manner
in
the
High
Street
of
Barchester
,
he
have
not
expect
that
other
would
make
more
fuss
about
it
than
he
be
inclined
to
do
himself
;
and
the
extent
of
his
hope
be
,
that
the
movement
may
have
be
make
in
time
to
prevent
any
further
paragraph
in
"
the
Jupiter
.
"
<EOS>
His
affair
,
however
,
be
not
allow
to
subside
thus
quietly
,
and
people
be
quite
as
much
inclined
to
talk
about
the
disinterested
sacrifice
he
have
make
,
as
they
have
before
be
to
upbraid
him
for
his
cupidity
.
  
<EOS>
the
most
remarkable
thing
that
occur
be
the
receipt
of
an
autographed
letter
from
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
in
which
the
primate
very
warmly
praise
his
conduct
,
and
beg
to
know
what
his
intention
be
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
reply
that
he
intend
to
be
rector
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
,
in
Barchester
,
and
so
that
matter
drop
.
<EOS>
then
the
newspaper
take
up
his
case
,
"
the
Jupiter
"
among
the
rest
,
and
waft
his
name
in
eulogistic
strain
through
every
reading
-
room
in
the
nation
.
<EOS>
It
be
discover
also
that
he
be
the
author
of
that
great
musical
work
,
_
Harding
's
Church
Music
_
,
 
and
a
new
edition
be
speak
of
,
though
,
I
believe
,
never
print
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
certain
that
the
work
be
introduce
into
the
Royal
Chapel
at
St.
James
's
,
and
that
a
long
criticism
appear
in
the
"
Musical
Scrutator
,
"
declare
that
in
no
previous
work
of
the
kind
have
so
much
research
be
join
with
such
exalted
musical
ability
,
and
assert
that
the
name
of
Harding
would
henceforward
be
know
wherever
the
art
be
cultivate
,
or
religion
value
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
high
praise
,
and
I
will
not
deny
that
Mr.
Harding
be
gratify
by
such
flattery
;
for
if
Mr.
Harding
be
vain
on
any
subject
,
it
be
on
that
of
music
.
<EOS>
but
here
the
matter
rest
.
<EOS>
the
second
edition
,
if
print
,
be
never
purchase
;
the
copy
which
have
be
introduce
into
the
Royal
Chapel
disappear
again
,
and
be
lay
by
in
peace
,
with
a
load
of
similar
literature
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Towers
of
"
the
Jupiter
"
and
his
brother
occupy
themselves
with
other
name
,
and
the
undying
fame
promise
to
our
friend
be
clearly
intend
to
be
posthumous
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
spend
much
of
his
time
with
his
friend
the
bishop
;
much
with
his
daughter
Mrs.
Bold
,
now
,
alas
,
a
widow
;
and
have
almost
daily
visit
the
wretched
remnant
of
his
former
subject
,
the
few
survive
bedesman
now
leave
at
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
six
of
them
be
still
live
.
<EOS>
the
number
,
accord
to
old
Hiram
's
will
,
should
always
have
be
twelve
.
<EOS>
but
after
the
abdication
of
their
warden
,
the
bishop
have
appoint
no
successor
to
him
,
no
new
occupant
of
the
charity
have
be
nominate
,
and
it
appear
as
though
the
hospital
at
Barchester
would
fall
into
abeyance
,
unless
the
power
that
be
should
take
some
step
towards
put
it
once
more
into
work
order
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
past
five
year
,
the
power
that
be
have
not
overlook
Barchester
Hospital
,
and
sundry
political
doctor
have
take
the
matter
in
hand
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
Mr.
Harding
's
resignation
,
"
the
Jupiter
"
have
very
clearly
show
what
ought
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
in
about
half
a
column
it
have
distribute
the
income
,
rebuild
the
building
,
put
an
end
to
all
bickering
,
regenerate
kindly
feeling
,
provide
for
Mr.
Harding
,
and
place
the
whole
thing
on
a
footing
<EOS>
which
could
not
but
be
satisfactory
to
the
city
and
Bishop
of
Barchester
,
and
to
the
nation
at
large
.
<EOS>
the
wisdom
of
this
scheme
be
testify
by
the
number
of
letter
which
"
Common
Sense
,
"
"
verita
,
"
and
"
one
that
love
fair
play
"
send
to
"
the
Jupiter
"
,
all
express
admiration
and
amplify
on
the
detail
give
.
<EOS>
It
be
singular
enough
that
no
adverse
letter
appear
at
all
,
and
,
therefore
,
none
of
course
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
but
Cassandra
be
not
believe
,
and
even
the
wisdom
of
"
the
Jupiter
"
sometimes
fall
on
deaf
ear
.
<EOS>
though
other
plan
do
not
put
themselves
forward
in
the
column
of
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
reformer
of
church
charity
be
not
slack
to
make
known
in
various
place
their
different
nostrum
for
set
Hiram
's
hospital
on
its
foot
again
.
<EOS>
a
learn
bishop
take
occasion
,
in
the
Upper
House
,
to
allude
to
the
matter
,
intimate
that
he
have
communicate
on
the
subject
with
his
right
reverend
brother
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
the
radical
member
for
Staleybridge
have
suggest
that
the
fund
should
be
alienate
for
the
education
of
the
agricultural
poor
of
the
country
,
and
he
amuse
the
house
by
some
anecdote
touch
the
superstition
and
habit
of
the
agriculturist
in
question
.
<EOS>
a
political
pamphleteer
have
produce
a
few
dozen
page
,
which
he
call
"
who
be
John
Hiram
's
heir
?
"
<EOS>
intend
to
give
an
infallible
rule
for
the
governance
of
all

<EOS>
the

heavily
over
the
nation

and
the
question
as
to
Hiram

heir
do
not
appear
to
interest
very
many
people
either

<EOS>
the

read
and
re

read

and
in
some
undistinguished
manner
pass
through
its
eleven
stage
without
appeal
or
dissent

<EOS>
what
would
John
Hiram
have
say
in
the

,
could
he
have
predict
that
some
forty

five
gentleman
would
take

what
it

<EOS>
It
be
however
to
be
hope
that
the
under

secretary
for
the
Home
Office
know
,
for
to
him
have
the
matter
be
confide

<EOS>
the

however

do
pass
,
and
at
the
time
at
which
this
history
be
suppose
to
commence

it
have
be

the
recipient

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
It
be
not

however
,
till
some
month
after
the
death
of
the

and
almost
immediately
consequent

the
installation
of
his
successor

<EOS>
that
notice
be
give
that
the
reform
be
about

carry
out

<EOS>
the
new
law
and
the
new
bishop
be
among
the
early
work
of
a
new
ministry

or
rather
of
a
ministry
who
,
have
for
awhile
give
place
to
their
opponent
,
have
then
return
to
power
;
and
the
death
of
Dr.
Grantly
occur
,
as
we
have
see
,
exactly
at
the
period
of
the
change

<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
Bold
!
<EOS>
how
well
do
that
widow
's
cap
become
her
,
and
the
solemn
gravity
with
which
she
devote
herself
to
her
new
duty
.
<EOS>
poor
Eleanor
!
  
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
with
me
John
Bold
be
ever
a
favourite
.
<EOS>
I
never
think
him
worthy
of
the
wife
he
have
win
.
<EOS>
but
in
her
estimation
he
be
most
worthy
.
<EOS>
her
be
one
of
those
feminine
heart
which
cling
to
a
husband
,
not
with
idolatry
,
for
worship
can
admit
of
no
defect
in
its
idol
,
but
with
the
perfect
tenacity
of
ivy
.
<EOS>
as
the
parasite
plant
will
follow
even
the
defect
of
the
trunk
which
it
embrace
,
so
do
Eleanor
cling
to
and
love
the
very
fault
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
declare
that
whatever
her
father
do
should
in
her
eye
be
right
.
<EOS>
She
then
transfer
her
allegiance
,
and
become
ever
ready
to
defend
the
bad
failing
of
her
lord
and
master
.
  
<EOS>
and
John
Bold
be
a
man
to
be
love
by
a
woman
;
he
be
himself
affectionate
;
he
be
confide
and
manly
;
and
that
arrogance
of
thought
,
unsustained
by
first
-
rate
ability
,
that
attempt
at
be
well
than
his
neighbour
which
jar
so
painfully
on
the
feeling
of
his
acquaintance
,
do
not
injure
him
in
the
estimation
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Could
she
even
have
admit
that
he
have
a
fault
,
his
early
death
would
have
blot
out
the
memory
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
weep
as
for
the
loss
of
the
most
perfect
treasure
with
which
mortal
woman
have
ever
be
endow
;
for
week
after
he
be
go
the
idea
of
future
happiness
in
this
world
<EOS>
be
hateful
to
her
;
consolation
,
as
it
be
call
,
be
insupportable
,
and
tear
and
sleep
be
her
only
relief
.
  
<EOS>
but
God
temper
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
have
within
her
the
live
source
of
other
care
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
there
be
to
be
create
for
her
another
subject
of
weal
or
woe
,
of
unutterable
joy
or
despairing
sorrow
,
as
God
in
his
mercy
may
vouchsafe
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
first
this
do
but
augment
her
grief
!
<EOS>
to
be
the
mother
of
a
poor
infant
,
orphan
before
it
be
bear
,
bring
forth
to
the
sorrow
of
an
ever
desolate
hearth
,
nurture
amidst
tear
and
wail
,
and
then
turn
adrift
into
the
world
without
the
aid
of
a
father
's
care
!
<EOS>
there
be
at
first
no
joy
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
,
however
,
her
heart
become
anxious
for
another
object
,
and
,
before
its
birth
,
the
stranger
be
expect
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
long
mother
.
<EOS>
just
eight
month
after
the
father
's
death
a
second
John
Bold
be
bear
,
and
if
the
worship
of
one
creature
can
be
innocent
in
another
,
let
us
hope
that
the
adoration
offer
over
the
cradle
of
the
fatherless
infant
may
not
be
impute
as
a
sin
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
worth
our
while
to
define
the
character
of
the
child
,
or
to
point
out
in
how
far
the
fault
of
the
father
be
redeem
within
that
little
breast
by
the
virtue
of
the
mother
.
<EOS>
the
baby
,
as
a
baby
,
be
all
that
be
delightful
,
and
I
can
not
foresee
that
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
inquire
into
the
fact
of
his
after
-
life
.
<EOS>
Our
present
business
at
Barchester
will
not
occupy
us
above
a
year
or
two
at
the
furth
,
and
I
will
leave
it
to
some
other
pen
to
produce
,
if
necessary
,
the
biography
of
John
Bold
the
young
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
a
baby
,
this
baby
be
all
that
could
be
desire
.
<EOS>
this
fact
no
one
attempt
to
deny
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
not
delightful
?
"
she
would
say
to
her
father
,
look
up
into
his
face
from
her
knee
,
her
lustrous
eye
overflow
with
soft
tear
,
her
young
face
encircle
by
her
close
widow
's
cap
,
and
her
hand
on
each
side
of
the
cradle
in
which
her
treasure
be
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
grandfather
would
gladly
admit
that
the
treasure
be
delightful
,
and
the
uncle
archdeacon
himself
would
agree
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
,
Eleanor
's
sister
,
would
re
-
echo
the
word
with
true
sisterly
energy
;
and
Mary
Bold
 
but
Mary
Bold
be
a
second
worshipper
at
the
same
shrine
.
  
<EOS>
the
baby
be
really
delightful
;
he
take
his
food
with
a
will
,
strike
out
his
toe
merrily
whenever
his
leg
be
uncover
,
and
do
not
have
fit
.
<EOS>
these
be
suppose
to
be
the
strong
point
of
baby
perfection
,
and
in
all
these
our
baby
excel
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
the
widow
's
deep
grief
be
soften
,
and
a
sweet
balm
be
pour
into
the
wound
which
she
have
think
nothing
but
death
could
heal
.
<EOS>
how
much
kind
be
God
to
us
than
we
be
willing
to
be
to
ourselves
!
<EOS>
at
the
loss
of
every
dear
face
,
at
the
last
going
of
every
well
-
belove
one
,
we
all
doom
ourselves
to
an
eternity
of
sorrow
,
and
look
to
waste
ourselves
away
in
an
ever
-
run
fountain
of
tear
.
<EOS>
how
seldom
do
such
grief
endure
!
<EOS>
how
blessed
be
the
goodness
which
forbid
it
to
do
so
!
"
<EOS>
let
me
ever
remember
my
living
friend
,
but
forget
them
as
soon
as
dead
,
"
be
the
prayer
of
a
wise
man
who
understand
the
mercy
of
God
.
<EOS>
few
perhaps
would
have
the
courage
to
express
such
a
wish
,
and
yet
to
do
so
would
only
be
to
ask
for
that
release
from
sorrow
which
a
kind
creator
almost
always
extend
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
however
,
have
it
imagine
that
Mrs.
Bold
forget
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
daily
think
of
him
with
all
conjugal
love
,
and
enshrine
his
memory
in
the
innermost
centre
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
but
yet
she
be
happy
in
her
baby
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
sweet
to
press
the
live
toy
to
her
breast
,
and
feel
that
a
human
being
exist
who
do
owe
,
and
be
to
owe
,
everything
to
her
;
whose
daily
food
be
draw
from
herself
;
whose
little
want
could
all
be
satisfied
by
her
;
whose
little
heart
would
first
love
her
and
her
only
;
whose
infant
tongue
would
make
its
first
effort
in
call
her
by
the
sweetest
name
a
woman
can
hear
.
<EOS>
and
so
Eleanor
's
bosom
become
tranquil
,
and
she
set
about
her
new
duty
eagerly
and
gratefully
.
  
<EOS>
as
regard
the
concern
of
the
world
,
John
Bold
have
leave
his
widow
in
prosperous
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
have
bequeath
to
her
all
that
he
possess
,
and
that
comprise
an
income
much
exceed
what
she
or
her
friend
think
necessary
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
amount
to
nearly
a
thousand
a
year
;
when
she
reflect
on
its
extent
,
her
dear
hope
be
to
hand
it
over
,
not
only
unimpaired
but
increase
,
to
her
husband
's
son
,
to
her
own
darling
,
to
the
little
man
who
now
lie
sleep
on
her
knee
,
happily
ignorant
of
the
care
which
be
to
be
accumulate
in
his
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
when
John
Bold
die
,
she
earnestly
implore
her
father
to
come
and
live
with
her
,
but
this
Mr.
Harding
decline
,
though
for
some
week
he
remain
with
her
as
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
forego
the
possession
of
some
small
home
of
his
own
,
and
so
remain
in
the
lodging
he
have
first
select
over
a
chemist
's
shop
in
the
High
Street
of
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Proudie
 
<EOS>
this
narrative
be
suppose
to
commence
immediately
after
the
installation
of
Dr.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
describe
the
ceremony
,
as
I
do
not
precisely
understand
its
nature
.
<EOS>
I
be
ignorant
whether
a
bishop
be
chair
like
a
member
of
Parliament
,
or
carry
in
a
gilt
coach
like
a
lord
mayor
,
or
swear
like
a
justice
of
peace
,
or
introduce
like
a
peer
to
the
upper
house
,
or
lead
between
two
brother
like
a
knight
of
the
garter
;
but
I
do
know
that
everything
be
properly
do
,
and
that
nothing
fit
or
become
to
a
young
bishop
be
omit
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
be
not
the
man
to
allow
anything
to
be
omit
that
may
be
become
to
his
new
dignity
.
<EOS>
He
understand
well
the
value
of
form
,
and
know
that
the
due
observance
of
rank
could
not
be
maintain
unless
the
exterior
trapping
belong
to
it
be
hold
in
proper
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
bear
to
move
in
high
circle
;
at
least
so
he
think
himself
,
and
circumstance
have
certainly
sustain
him
in
this
view
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
nephew
of
an
irish
baron
by
his
mother
's
side
,
and
his
wife
be
the
niece
of
a
Scotch
earl
.
<EOS>
He
have
for
year
hold
some
clerical
office
appertain
to
courtly
matter
,
which
have
enable
him
to
live
in
London
,
and
to
entrust
his
parish
to
his
curate
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
preacher
to
the
royal
beefeater
,
curator
of
theological
manuscript
in
the
Ecclesiastical
Courts
,
chaplain
to
the
Queen
's
yeomanry
guard
,
and
almoner
to
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
of
Rappe
-
Blankenberg
.
  
<EOS>
His
residence
in
the
metropolis
,
render
necessary
by
duty
thus
entrust
to
him
,
his
high
connexion
,
and
the
peculiar
talent
and
nature
of
the
man
,
recommend
him
to
person
in
power
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
become
know
as
a
useful
and
rise
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
some
few
year
since
,
even
within
the
memory
of
many
who
be
not
yet
willing
to
call
themselves
old
,
a
liberal
clergyman
be
a
person
not
frequently
to
be
meet
.
<EOS>
Sydney
Smith
be
such
and
be
look
on
as
little
well
than
an
infidel
;
a
few
other
also
may
be
name
,
but
they
be
_
rarae
ave
_
and
be
regard
with
doubt
and
distrust
by
their
brother
.
<EOS>
no
man
be
so
surely
a
Tory
as
a
country
rector
 
nowhere
<EOS>
be
the
power
that
be
so
cherish
as
at
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
Dr.
Whately
be
make
an
archbishop
,
and
Dr.
Hampden
some
year
afterwards
regius
professor
,
many
wise
divine
see
that
a
change
be
take
place
in
man
's
mind
,
and
that
more
liberal
idea
would
henceforward
be
suitable
to
the
priest
as
well
as
to
the
laity
.
<EOS>
clergyman
begin
to
be
hear
of
who
have
cease
to
anathematize
papist
on
the
one
hand
,
or
vilify
dissenter
on
the
other

<EOS>
It
appear
clear
that
High
Church
principle
,
as
they
be
call
,
be
no
long
to
be
sure
claim
to
promotion
with
at
any
rate
one
section
of
statesman
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
be
one
among
those
who
early
in
life
adapt
himself
to
the
view
hold
by
the
Whigs
on
most
theological
and
religious
subject
.
<EOS>
He
bear
with
the
idolatry
of
Rome
,
tolerate
even
the
infidelity
of
Socinianism
,
and
be
hand
and

with
the
Presbyterian
Synods
of
Scotland
and
Ulster
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
man
at
such
a
time
be
find
to
be
useful
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
's
name
begin
to
appear
in

<EOS>
He
be
make

of
a

and
the
Maynooth
grant
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
on
this
account
be
take
as
prove
that
Dr.
Proudie
be
a
man
of
great
mental
power
,
or
even
of
much
capacity
for
business
,
for
such
quality
have
not
be
require
in
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
arrangement
of
those
church
reform
with
which
he
be
connect
,
the
idea
and
original
conception
of
the
work
to
be
do
be
generally
furnish
by
the
liberal
statesman
of
the
day
,
and
the
labour
of
the
detail
be
bear
by
official
of
a
low
rank
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
think
expedient
that
the
name
of
some
clergyman
should
appear
in
such
matter
,
and
as
Dr.
Proudie
have
become
know
as
a
tolerate
divine
,
great
use
of
this
sort
be
make
of
his
name
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
do
much
active
good
,
he
never
do
any
harm
;
he
be
amenable
to
those
who
be
really
in
authority
and
,
at
the
sitting
of
the
various
board
to
which
he
belong
,
maintain
a
kind
of
dignity
which
have
its
value
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
possess
of
sufficient
tact
to
answer
the
purpose
for
which
he
be
require
without
make
himself
troublesome
;
but
it
must
not
therefore
be
surmise
that
he
doubt
his
own
power
,
or
fail
to
believe
that
he
could
himself
take
a
high
part
in
high
affair
when
his
own
turn
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
bide
his
time
,
and
patiently
look
forward
to
the
day
when
he
himself
would
sit
authoritative
at
some
board
,
and
talk
and
direct
,
and
rule
the
roost
,
while
less
star
sit
round
and
obey
,
as
he
have
so
well
accustomed
himself
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
His
reward
and
his
time
have
now
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
select
for
the
vacant
bishopric
and
,
on
the
next
vacancy
which
may
occur
in
any
diocese
,
would
take
his
place
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
prepare
to
give
not
a
silent
vote
in
all
matter
concern
the
weal
of
the
church
establishment
.
<EOS>
toleration
be
to
be
the
basis
on
which
he
be
to
fight
his
battle
,
and
<EOS>
in
the
honest
courage
of
his
heart
he
think
no
evil
would
come
to
him
in
encounter
even
such
foe
as
his
brother
of
Exeter
and
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
be
an
ambitious
man
,
and
before
he
be
well
consecrate
Bishop
of
Barchester
,
he
have
begin
to
look
up
to
archiepiscopal
splendour
,
and
the
glory
of
Lambeth
,
or
at
any
rate
of
Bishopsthorpe
.
<EOS>
He
be
comparatively
young
,
and
have
,
as
he
fondly
flatter
himself
,
be
select
as
possess
such
gift
,
natural
and
acquire
,
as
must
be
sure
to
recommend
him
to
a
yet
high
notice
,
now
that
a
high
sphere
be
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
be
,
therefore
,
quite
prepared
to
take
a
conspicuous
part
in
all
theological
affair
appertain
to
these
realm
;
and
have
such
view
,
by
no
mean
intend
to
bury
himself
at
Barchester
as
his
predecessor
have
do
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
London
should
still
be
his
ground
:
<EOS>
a
comfortable
mansion
in
a
provincial
city
may
be
well
enough
for
the
dead
month
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Dr.
Proudie
have
always
feel
it
necessary
to
his
position
to
retire
from
London
when
other
great
and
fashionable
people
do
so
;
but
London
should
still
be
his
fix
residence
,
and
it
be
in
London
that
he
resolve
to
exercise
that
hospitality
<EOS>
so
peculiarly
recommend
to
all
bishop
by
St.
Paul
.
<EOS>
how
otherwise
could
he
keep
himself
before
the
world
?
<EOS>
how
else
give
to
the
government
,
in
matter
theological
,
the
full
benefit
of
his
weight
and
talent
?
  
<EOS>
this
resolution
be
no
doubt
a
salutary
one
as
regard
the
world
at
large
,
but
be
not
likely
to
make
him
popular
either
with
the
clergy
or
people
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
have
always
live
there
 
in
truth
,
it
be
hard
for
a
bishop
to
be
popular
after
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
His
income
have
average
£
9,000
a
year
;
his
successor
be
to
be
rigidly
limited
to
£
5,000
.
<EOS>
He
have
but
one
child
on
whom
to
spend
his
money
;
Dr.
Proudie
have
seven
or
eight
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
man
of
few
personal
expense
,
and
they
have
be
confine
to
the
taste
of
a
moderate
gentleman
;
but
Dr.
Proudie
have
to
maintain
a
position
in
fashionable
society
,
and
have
that
to
do
with
comparatively
small
mean
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
have
certainly
keep
his
carriage
as
become
a
bishop
,
but
his
carriage
,
horse
,
and
coachman
,
though
they
do
very
well
for
Barchester
,
would
have
be
almost
ridiculous
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
determine
that
her
husband
's
equipage
should
not
shame
her
,
and
thing
on
which
Mrs.
Proudie
resolve
be
generally
accomplish
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
this
it
be
likely
to
result
that
Dr.
Proudie
would
not
spend
much
money
at
Barchester
,
whereas
his
predecessor
have
deal
with
the
tradesman
of
the
city
in
a
manner
very
much
to
their
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
Grantlys
,
father
and
son
,
have
spend
their
money
like
gentleman
,
but
it
soon
become
whisper
in
Barchester
that
Dr.
Proudie
be
not
unacquainted
with
those
prudent
device
by
which
the
utmost
show
of
wealth
be
produce
from
limited
mean
.
  
<EOS>
in
person
Dr.
Proudie
be
a
good
-
looking
man
;
spruce
and
dapper
,
and
very
tidy
.
<EOS>
He
be
somewhat
below
middle
height
,
be
about
five
foot
four
;
but
he
make
up
for
the
inch
which
he
want
by
the
dignity
with
which
he
carry
those
which
he
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
fault
of
his
own
if
he
have
not
a
command
eye
,
for
he
study
hard
to
assume
it
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
well
form
,
though
perhaps
the
sharpness
of
his
nose
may
give
to
his
face
in
the
eye
of
some
people
an
air
of
insignificance
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
it
be
greatly
redeem
by
his
mouth
and
chin
,
of
which
he
be
justly
proud
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
may
well
be
say
to
have
be
a
fortunate
man
,
for
he
be
not
bear
to
wealth
,
and
he
be
now
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
nevertheless
,
he
have
his
care
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
large
family
,
of
whom
the
three
eld
be
daughter
,
now
all
grow
up
and
fit
for
fashionable
life
;
 
and
he
have
a
wife
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
intention
to
breathe
a
word
against
the
character
of
Mrs.
Proudie
,
but
still
I
can
not
think
that
with
all
her
virtue
she
add
much
to
her
husband
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
that
in
matter
domestic
she
rule
supreme
over
her
titular
lord
,
and
rule
with
a
rod
of
iron
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
.
<EOS>
thing
domestic
Dr.
Proudie
may
have
abandon
to
her
,
if
not
voluntarily
,
yet
willingly
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Proudie
be
not
satisfied
with
such
home
dominion
,
and
stretch
her
power
over
all
his
movement
,
and
will
not
even
abstain
from
thing
spiritual
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
bishop
be
hen
-
peck
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
wife
,
in
her
happy
home
at
Plumstead
,
know
how
to
assume
the
full
privilege
of
her
rank
and
express
her
own
mind
in
become
tone
and
place
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Grantly
's
sway
,
if
sway
<EOS>
she
have
,
be
easy
and
beneficent
.
<EOS>
She
never
shame
her
husband
;
before
the
world
she
be
a
pattern
of
obedience
;
her
voice
be
never
loud
,
nor
her
look
sharp
:
doubtless
she
value
power
,
and
have
not
unsuccessfully
strive
to
acquire
it
;
but
she
know
what
should
be
the
limit
of
a
woman
's
rule
.
  
<EOS>
not
so
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
this
lady
be
habitually
authoritative
to
all
,
but
to
her
poor
husband
she
be
despotic
.
<EOS>
successful
as
have
be
his
career
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
it
would
seem
that
in
the
eye
of
his
wife
he
be
never
right
.
<EOS>
all
hope
of
defend
himself
have
long
pass
from
him
;
indeed
he
rarely
even
attempt
self
-
justification
,
and
be
aware
that
submission
produce
the
near
approach
to
peace
which
his
own
house
can
ever
attain
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
not
be
able
to
sit
at
the
board
and
committee
to
which
her
husband
have
be
call
by
the
State
,
nor
,
as
he
often
reflect
,
can
she
make
her
voice
hear
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
she
will
refuse
to
him
permission
to
attend
to
this
branch
of
a
bishop
's
duty
;
it
may
be
that
she
will
insist
on
his
close
attendance
to
his
own
closet
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
whisper
a
word
on
the
subject
to
living
ear
,
but
he
have
already
make
his
fixed
resolve
.
<EOS>
Should
such
attempt
be
make
he
will
rebel
.
<EOS>
dog
have
turn
against
their
master
,
and
even
Neapolitans
against
their
ruler
,
when
oppression
have
be
too
severe
.
<EOS>
and
Dr.
Proudie
feel
within
himself
that
if
the
cord
be
draw
too
tight
,
he
also
can
muster
courage
and
resist
.
  
<EOS>
the
state
of
vassalage
in
which
our
bishop
have
be
keep
by
his
wife
have
not
tend
to
exalt
his
character
in
the
eye
of
his
daughter
,
who
assume
in
address
their
father
too
much
of
that
authority
which
be
not
properly
belong
,
at
any
rate
,
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
on
the
whole
,
fine
engaging
young
lady
.
<EOS>
They
be
tall
and
robust
like
their
mother
,
whose
high
cheek
-
bone
,
and
 
we
may
say
auburn
hair
they
all
inherit
.
<EOS>
They
think
somewhat
too
much
of
their
grand
-
uncle
,
who
have
not
hitherto
return
the
compliment
by
think
much
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
their
father
be
a
bishop
,
it
be
probable
that
family
tie
will
be
draw
closer
.
<EOS>
consider
their
connexion
with
the
church
,
they
entertain
but
few
prejudice
against
the
pleasure
of
the
world
,
and
have
certainly
not
distress
their
parent
,
as
too
many
english
girl
have
lately
do
,
by
any
enthusiastic
wish
to
devote
themselves
to
the
seclusion
of
a
protestant
nunnery
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
's
son
be
still
at
school
.
  
<EOS>
one
other
marked
peculiarity
in
the
character
of
the
bishop
's
wife
must
be
mention
.
<EOS>
though
not
averse
to
the
society
and
manner
of
the
world
,
she
be
in
her
own
way
a
religious
woman
;
and
the
form
in
which
this
tendency
show
itself
in
her
be
by
a
strict
observance
of
sabbatarian
rule
.
<EOS>
dissipation
and
low
dress
during
the
week
be
,
under
her
control
,
atone
for
by
three
service
,
an
evening
sermon
read
by
herself
,
and
a
perfect
abstinence
from
any
cheer
employment
on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
for
those
under
her
roof
to
whom
the
dissipation
and
low
dress
be
not
extended
,
her
servant
namely
and
her
husband
,
the
compensate
strictness
of
the
Sabbath
include
all
.
<EOS>
Woe
betide
the
recreant
housemaid
who
be
find
to
have
be
listen
to
the
honey
of
a
sweetheart
in
the
Regent
's
park
instead
of
the
soul
-
stir
evening
discourse
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
she
send
adrift
,
but
she
be
so
send
with
a
character
which
leave
her
little
hope
of
a
decent
place
.
<EOS>
Woe
betide
the
six
-
foot
hero
who
escort
Mrs.
Proudie
to
her
pew
in
red
plush
breech
,
if
he
slip
away
to
the
neighbour
beer
-
shop
,
instead
of
fall
into
the
back
seat
appropriate
to
his
use
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
the
eye
of
Argus
for
such
offender
.
<EOS>
occasional
drunkenness
in
the
week
may
be
overlook
,
for
six
foot
on
low
wage
be
hardly
to
be
procure
if
the
moral
be
always
keep
at
a
high
pitch
,
but
not
even
for
grandeur
or
economy
will
Mrs.
Proudie
forgive
a
desecration
of
the
Sabbath
.
  
<EOS>
in
such
matter
Mrs.
Proudie
allow
herself
to
be
often
guide
by
that
eloquent
preacher
,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Slope
,
and
as
Dr.
Proudie
be
guide
by
his
wife
,
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
eminent
man
we
have
name
have
obtain
a
good
deal
of
control
over
Dr.
Proudie
in
matter
concern
religion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
only
preferment
have
hitherto
be
that
of
reader
and
preacher
in
a
London
district
church
;
and
on
the
consecration
of
his
friend
the
new
bishop
,
he
readily
give
this
up
to
undertake
the
onerous
but
congenial
duty
of
domestic
chaplain
to
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
on
his
first
introduction
must
not
be
bring
before
the
public
at
the
tail
of
a
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
the
Bishop
's
Chaplain
 
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Slope
's
parentage
<EOS>
I
be
not
able
to
say
much
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
it
assert
that
he
be
lineally
descend
from
that
eminent
physician
who
assist
at
the
birth
of
Mr.
T.
Shandy
,
and
that
in
early
year
he
add
an
"
e
"
to
his
name
,
for
the
sake
of
euphony
,
as
other
great
man
have
do
before
him
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
I
presume
he
be
christen
Obadiah
,
for
that
be
his
name
,
in
commemoration
of
the
conflict
in
which
his
ancestor
so
distinguish
himself
.
<EOS>
all
my
research
on
the
subject
have
,
however
,
fail
in
enable
me
to
fix
the
date
on
which
the
family
change
its
religion
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
sizar
at
Cambridge
,
and
have
there
conduct
himself
at
any
rate
successfully
,
for
in
due
process
of
time
<EOS>
he
be
an
M.A.
,
have
university
pupil
under
his
care
.
<EOS>
from
thence
he
be
transfer
to
London
,
and
become
preach
at
a
new
district
church
build
on
the
confine
of
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
this
position
when
congenial
idea
on
religious
subject
recommend
him
to
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
the
intercourse
have
become
close
and
confidential
.
  
<EOS>
have
be
thus
familiarly
throw
among
the
Misses
Proudie
,
it
be
no
more
than
natural
that
some
soft
feeling
than
friendship
should
be
engender
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
passage
of
love
between
him
and
the
eld
hope
,
Olivia
,
but
they
have
hitherto
result
in
no
favourable
arrangement
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
Mr.
Slope
,
have
make
a
declaration
of
affection
,
afterwards
withdraw
it
on
find
that
the
doctor
have
no
immediate
worldly
fund
with
which
to
endow
his
child
,
and
it
may
easily
be
conceive
that
Miss
Proudie
,
after
such
an
announcement
on
his
part
,
be
not
readily
dispose
to
receive
any
further
show
of
affection
.
<EOS>
on
the
appointment
of
Dr.
Proudie
to
the
bishopric
of
Barchester
,
Mr.
Slope
's
view
be
in
truth
somewhat
altered
.
<EOS>
bishop
,
even
though
they
be
poor
,
can
provide
for
clerical
child
,
and
Mr.
Slope
begin
to
regret
that
he
have
not
be
more
disintereste
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
hear
the
tiding
of
the
doctor
's
elevation
than
he
recommence
his
siege
,
not
violently
,
indeed
,
but
respectfully
,
and
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Olivia
Proudie
,
however
,
be
a
girl
of
spirit
:
she
have
the
blood
of
two
peer
in
her
vein
,
and
well
still
she
have
another
lover
on
her
book
,
so
Mr.
Slope
sigh
in
vain
,
and
the
pair
soon
find
it
convenient
to
establish
a
mutual
bond
of
inveterate
hatred
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
think
singular
that
Mrs.
Proudie
's
friendship
for
the
young
clergyman
should
remain
firm
after
such
an
affair
,
but
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
have
know
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
though
very
fond
of
Mr.
Slope
herself
,
she
have
never
conceive
the
idea
that
either
of
her
daughter
would
become
so
,
and
remember
their
high
birth
and
social
advantage
,
expect
for
them
match
of
a
different
sort
.
<EOS>
neither
the
gentleman
nor
the
lady
find
it
necessary
to
enlighten
her
.
<EOS>
Olivia
's
two
sister
have
each
know
of
the
affair
,
as
have
all
the
servant
,
as
have
all
the
people
live
in
the
adjoining
house
on
either
side
,
but
Mrs.
Proudie
have
be
keep
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
soon
comfort
himself
with
the
reflexion
that
,
as
he
have
be
select
as
chaplain
to
the
bishop
,
it
would
probably
be
in
his
power
to
get
the
good
thing
in
the
bishop
's
gift
without
trouble
himself
with
the
bishop
's
daughter
,
and
he
find
himself
able
to
endure
the
pang
of
reject
love
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
himself
down
in
the
railway
carriage
,
confront
the
bishop
and
Mrs.
Proudie
as
they
start
on
their
first
journey
to
Barchester
,
he
begin
to
form
in
his
own
mind
a
plan
of
his
future
life
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
his
patron
's
strong
point
,
but
he
know
the
weak
one
as
well
.
<EOS>
He
understand
correctly
enough
to
what
attempt
the
new
bishop
's
high
spirit
would
soar
,
and
he
rightly
guess
that
public
life
would
better
suit
the
great
man
's
taste
than
the
small
detail
of
diocesan
duty
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
 
he
,
Mr.
Slope
,
 
would
in
effect
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
resolve
,
and
to
give
Mr.
Slope
his
due
,
he
have
both
courage
and
spirit
to
bear
him
out
in
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
should
have
a
hard
battle
to
fight
,
for
the
power
and
patronage
of
the
see
would
be
equally
covet
by
another
great
mind
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
would
also
choose
to
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
flatter
himself
that
he
could
outmanoeuvre
the
lady
.
<EOS>
She
must
live
much
in
London
,
while
he
would
always
be
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
She
would
necessarily
remain
ignorant
of
much
,
while
he
would
know
everything
belong
to
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
doubtless
,
he
must
flatter
and
cajole
,
perhaps
yield
in
some
thing
,
but
he
do
not
doubt
of
ultimate
triumph
.
<EOS>
if
all
other
mean
fail
,
he
could
join
the
bishop
against
his
wife
,
inspire
courage
into
the
unhappy
man
,
lie
an
axe
to
the
root
of
the
woman
's
power
,
and
emancipate
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
his
thought
as
he
sit
look
at
the
sleep
pair
in
the
railway
carriage
,
and
Mr.
Slope
be
not
the
man
to
trouble
himself
with
such
thought
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
be
possess
of
more
than
average
ability
,
and
be
of
good
courage
.
<EOS>
though
he
can
stoop
to
fawn
,
and
stoop
low
indeed
,
if
need
be
,
he
have
still
within
him
the
power
to
assume
the
tyrant
;
 
and
with
the
power
he
have
certainly
the
wish
.
<EOS>
His
acquirement
be
not
of
the
high
order
,
but
such
as
they
be
,
they
be
completely
under
control
,
and
he
know
the
use
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
gift
with
a
certain
kind
of
pulpit
eloquence
,
not
likely
indeed
to
be
persuasive
with
man
,
but
powerful
with
the
soft
sex
.
<EOS>
in
his
sermon
he
deal
greatly
in
denunciation
,
excite
the
mind
of
his
weak
hearer
with
a
not
unpleasant
terror
,
and
leave
an
impression
on
their
mind
that
all
mankind
be
in
a
perilous
state
,
and
all
womankind
,
too
,
except
those
who
attend
regularly
to
the
evening
lecture
in
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
His
look
and
tone
be
extremely
severe
,
so
much
so
<EOS>
that
one
can
not
but
fancy
that
he
regard
the
great
part
of
the
world
as
be
infinitely
too
bad
for
his
care
.
<EOS>
as
he
walk
through
the
street
his
very
face
denote
his
horror
of
the
world
's
wickedness
,
and
there
be
always
an
anathema
lurk
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
in
doctrine
he
,
like
his
patron
,
be
tolerant
of
dissent
,
if
so
strict
a
mind
can
be
call
tolerant
of
anything
.
<EOS>
with
Wesleyan
-
Methodists
he
have
something
in
common
,
but
his
soul
tremble
in
agony
at
the
iniquity
of
the
Puseyites
.
<EOS>
His
aversion
be
carry
to
thing
outward
as
well
as
inward
.
<EOS>
His
gall
rise
at
a
new
church
with
a
high
-
pitched
roof
;
a
full
-
breasted
black
silk
waistcoat
be
with
him
a
symbol
of
Satan
;
and
a
profane
jest
-
book
would
not
,
in
his
view
,
more
foully
desecrate
the
church
seat
of
a
Christian
than
a
book
of
prayer
print
with
red
letter
and
ornament
with
a
cross
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
Most
active
clergyman
have
their
hobby
,
and
Sunday
observance
be
his
.
<EOS>
Sunday
,
however
,
be
a
word
which
never
pollute
his
mouth
 
<EOS>
it
be
always
"
the
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
"
the
"
desecration
of
the
Sabbath
,
"
as
he
delight
to
call
it
,
be
to
him
meat
and
drink
:
he
thrive
upon
that
as
policeman
do
on
the
general
evil
habit
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
loved
subject
of
all
his
evening
discourse
,
the
source
of
all
his
eloquence
,
the
secret
of
all
his
power
over
the
female
heart
.
<EOS>
to
him
the
revelation
of
God
appear
only
in
that
one
law
give
for
jewish
observance
.
<EOS>
to
him
the
mercy
of
our
Saviour
speak
in
vain
,
to
him
in
vain
have
be
preach
that
sermon
which
fall
from
divine
lip
on
the
mountain
 
<EOS>
"
Blessed
be
the
meek
,
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
"
 
<EOS>
"
bless
be
the
merciful
,
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
him
the
New
Testament
be
comparatively
of
little
moment
,
for
from
it
can
he
draw
no
fresh
authority
for
that
dominion
which
he
love
to
exercise
over
at
least
a
seventh
part
of
man
's
allot
time
here
below
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
tall
,
and
not
ill
-
make
.
<EOS>
His
foot
and
hand
be
large
,
as
have
ever
be
the
case
with
all
his
family
,
but
he
have
a
broad
chest
and
wide
shoulder
to
carry
off
these
excrescence
,
and
on
the
whole
his
figure
be
good
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
however
,
be
not
specially
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
lank
and
of
a
dull
pale
reddish
hue
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
form
into
three
straight
,
lumpy
masse
,
each
brush
with
admirable
precision
and
cement
with
much
grease
;
two
of
them
adhere
closely
to
the
side
of
his
face
,
and
the
other
lie
at
right
angle
above
them
.
<EOS>
He
wear
no
whisker
,
and
be
always
punctiliously
shave
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
nearly
of
the
same
colour
as
his
hair
,
though
perhaps
a
little
redder
:
it
be
not
unlike
beef
 
beef
,
however
,
one
would
say
,
of
a
bad
quality
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
be
capacious
and
high
,
but
square
and
heavy
and
unpleasantly
shine
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
be
large
,
though
his
lip
be
thin
and
bloodless
;
and
his
big
,
prominent
,
pale
-
brown
eye
inspire
anything
but
confidence
.
<EOS>
His
nose
,
however
,
be
his
redeem
feature
:
it
be
pronounce
,
straight
and
well
-
form
;
though
I
myself
should
have
like
it
better
do
it
not
possess
a
somewhat
spongy
,
porous
appearance
,
as
though
it
have
be
cleverly
form
out
of
a
red
-
coloured
cork
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
could
endure
to
shake
hand
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
a
cold
,
clammy
perspiration
always
exude
from
him
,
the
small
drop
be
ever
to
be
see
stand
on
his
brow
,
and
his
friendly
grasp
be
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Mr.
Slope
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
man
who
have
suddenly
fall
into
the
midst
of
Barchester
Close
,
and
be
destine
there
to
assume
the
station
which
have
heretofore
be
fill
by
the
son
of
the
late
bishop
.
<EOS>
think
,
<EOS>
oh
,
my
meditative
reader
,
<EOS>
what
an
associate
we
have
here
for
those
comfortable
prebendary
,
those
gentlemanlike
clerical
doctor
,
those
happy
,
well
-
use
,
well
-
feed
minor
canon
who
have
grow
into
existence
at
Barchester
under
the
kindly
wing
of
Bishop
Grantly
!
  
<EOS>
but
not
as
a
mere
associate
for
these
do
Mr.
Slope
travel
down
to
Barchester
with
the
bishop
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
be
,
if
not
their
master
,
at
least
the
chief
among
them
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
lead
and
to
have
follower
;
he
intend
to
hold
the
purse
-
string
of
the
diocese
and
draw
round
him
an
obedient
herd
of
his
poor
and
hungry
brother
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
we
can
hardly
fail
to
draw
a
comparison
between
the
archdeacon
and
our
new
private
chaplain
,
and
despite
the
manifold
fault
of
the
former
,
one
can
hardly
fail
to
make
it
much
to
his
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
both
man
be
eager
,
much
too
eager
,
to
support
and
increase
the
power
of
their
order
.
<EOS>
both
be
anxious
that
the
world
should
be
priest
-
govern
,
though
they
have
probably
never
confess
so
much
,
even
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
both
begrudge
any
other
kind
of
dominion
hold
by
man
over
man
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
if
he
admit
the
Queen
's
supremacy
in
thing
spiritual
,
only
admit
it
as
be
due
to
the
quasi
-
priesthood
convey
in
the
consecrate
quality
of
her
coronation
,
and
he
regard
thing
temporal
as
be
by
their
nature
subject
to
those
which
be
spiritual
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
idea
of
sacerdotal
rule
be
of
quite
a
different
class
.
<EOS>
He
care
nothing
,
one
way
or
the
other
,
for
the
Queen
's
supremacy
;
these
to
his
ear
be
empty
word
,
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
form
he
regard
but
little
,
and
such
titular
expression
as
supremacy
,
consecration
,
ordination
,
and
the
like
convey
of
themselves
no
significance
to
him
.
<EOS>
let
him
be
supreme
who
can
.
<EOS>
the
temporal
king
,
judge
,
or
gaoler
can
work
but
on
the
body
.
<EOS>
the
spiritual
master
,
if
he
have
the
necessary
gift
and
can
duly
use
them
,
have
a
wide
field
of
empire
.
<EOS>
He
work
upon
the
soul
.
<EOS>
if
he
can
make
himself
be
believe
,
he
can
be
all
powerful
over
those
who
listen
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
careful
to
meddle
with
none
who
be
too
strong
in
intellect
,
or
too
weak
in
flesh
,
he
may
indeed
be
supreme
.
<EOS>
and
such
be
the
ambition
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
interfere
very
little
with
the
worldly
doing
of
those
who
be
in
any
way
subject
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
omit
to
notice
misconduct
among
his
clergy
,
immorality
in
his
parish
,
or
omission
in
his
family
,
but
he
be
not
anxious
to
do
so
where
the
necessity
could
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
trouble
with
a
propensity
to
be
curious
,
and
as
long
as
those
around
him
be
taint
with
no
heretical
lean
towards
dissent
,
as
long
as
they
fully
and
freely
admit
the
efficacy
of
Mother
Church
,
he
be
willing
that
that
mother
should
be
merciful
and
affectionate
,
prone
to
indulgence
,
and
unwilling
to
chastise
.
<EOS>
He
himself
enjoy
the
good
thing
of
this
world
and
like
to
let
it
be
know
that
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
cordially
despise
any
brother
rector
who
think
harm
of
dinner
-
party
,
or
dread
the
danger
of
a
moderate
claret
-
jug
;
consequently
,
dinner
-
party
and
claret
-
jug
be
common
in
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
give
law
and
to
be
obey
in
them
implicitly
,
but
he
endeavour
that
his
ordinance
should
be
within
the
compass
of
the
man
and
not
unpalatable
to
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
have
rule
among
his
clerical
neighbour
now
for
sundry
year
,
and
as
he
have
maintain
his
power
without
become
unpopular
,
it
may
be
presume
that
he
have
exercise
some
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Slope
's
conduct
much
can
not
be
say
,
as
his
grand
career
be
yet
to
commence
,
but
it
may
be
premise
that
his
taste
will
be
very
different
from
those
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
conceive
it
to
be
his
duty
to
know
all
the
private
doing
and
desire
of
the
flock
entrust
to
his
care
.
<EOS>
from
the
poor
class
he
exact
an
unconditional
obedience
to
set
rule
of
conduct
,
and
if
disobey
he
have
recourse
,
like
his
great
ancestor
,
to
the
fulmination
of
an
Ernulfus
:
"
Thou
shalt
be
damn
in
thy
go
in
and
<EOS>
in
thy
come
out
 
in
thy
eating
and
thy
drinking
,
"
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
with
the
rich
,
experience
have
already
teach
him
that
a
different
line
of
action
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
man
in
the
upper
walk
of
life
do
not
mind
be
curse
,
and
the
woman
,
presume
that
it
be
do
in
delicate
phrase
,
rather
like
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
,
therefore
,
give
up
so
important
a
portion
of
believe
Christians
.
<EOS>
with
the
man
,
indeed
,
he
be
generally
at
variance
;
they
be
harden
sinner
,
on
whom
the
voice
of
the
priestly
charmer
too
often
fall
in
vain
;
but
with
the
lady
,
old
and
young
,
firm
and
frail
,
devout
and
dissipate
,
he
be
,
as
he
conceive
,
all
powerful
.
<EOS>
He
can
reprove
fault
with
so
much
flattery
and
utter
censure
in
so
caress
a
manner
that
the
female
heart
,
if
it
glow
with
a
spark
of
Low
Church
susceptibility
,
can
not
withstand
him
.
<EOS>
in
many
house
he
be
thus
an
admired
guest
:
the
husband
,
for
their
wife
"
sake
,
be
fain
to
admit
him
;
and
when
once
admit
it
be
not
easy
to
shake
him
off
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
a
pawing
,
greasy
way
with
him
,
which
do
not
endear
him
to
those
who
do
not
value
him
for
their
soul
"
sake
,
and
he
be
not
a
man
to
make
himself
at
once
popular
in
a
large
circle
such
as
be
now
likely
to
surround
him
at
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
a
morning
visit
 
<EOS>
It
be
know
that
Dr.
Proudie
would
immediately
have
to
reappoint
to
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
under
the
act
of
Parliament
to
which
allusion
have
be
make
;
no
one
imagine
that
any
choice
be
leave
to
him
 
<EOS>
no
one
for
a
moment
think
that
he
could
appoint
any
other
than
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
himself
,
when
he
hear
how
the
matter
have
be
settle
,
without
trouble
himself
much
on
the
subject
,
consider
it
as
certain
that
he
would
go
back
to
his
pleasant
house
and
garden
.
<EOS>
and
though
there
would
be
much
that
be
melancholy
,
nay
,
almost
heartrende
,
in
such
a
return
,
he
still
be
glad
that
it
be
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
may
probably
be
persuade
to
return
there
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
all
but
promise
to
do
so
,
though
she
still
entertain
an
idea
that
that
great
of
mortal
,
that
important
atom
of
humanity
,
that
little
god
upon
earth
,
Johnny
Bold
her
baby
,
ought
to
have
a
house
of
his
own
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
Mr.
Harding
's
mind
in
the
matter
,
he
do
not
feel
any
peculiar
personal
interest
in
the
appointment
of
Dr.
Proudie
to
the
bishopric
.
<EOS>
He
,
as
well
as
other
at
Barchester
,
regret
that
a
man
should
be
send
among
them
who
,
they
be
aware
,
be
not
of
their
way
of
thinking
;
but
Mr.
Harding
himself
be
not
a
bigoted
man
on
point
of
church
doctrine
,
and
he
be
quite
prepared
to
welcome
Dr.
Proudie
to
Barchester
in
a
graceful
and
become
manner
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
seek
and
nothing
to
fear
;
he
feel
that
it
behove
him
to
be
on
good
term
with
his
bishop
,
and
he
do
not
anticipate
any
obstacle
that
would
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
he
proceed
to
pay
his
respect
at
the
palace
the
second
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
bishop
and
his
chaplain
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
go
alone
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
propose
to
accompany
him
,
and
Mr.
Harding
be
not
sorry
to
have
a
companion
,
who
would
remove
from
his
shoulder
the
burden
of
the
conversation
in
such
an
interview
.
<EOS>
in
the
affair
of
the
consecration
Dr.
Grantly
have
be
introduce
to
the
bishop
,
and
Mr.
Harding
have
also
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
keep
himself
in
the
background
,
and
he
be
now
to
be
present
to
the
great
man
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
feeling
be
of
a
much
strong
nature
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
exactly
the
man
to
overlook
his
own
slight
claim
,
or
to
forgive
the
preference
show
to
another
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
be
play
Venus
to
his
Juno
,
and
he
be
prepared
to
wage
an
internecine
war
against
the
owner
of
the
wish
-
for
apple
,
and
all
his
satellite
,
private
chaplain
,
and
other
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
behove
him
also
to
conduct
himself
towards
the
intruder
as
an
old
archdeacon
should
conduct
himself
to
an
incoming
bishop
;
and
though
he
be
well
aware
of
all
Dr.
Proudie
's
abominable
opinion
as
regard
dissenter
,
church
reform
,
the
hebdomadal
council
,
and
such
like
;
though
he
dislike
the
man
,
and
hate
the
doctrine
,
still
he
be
prepared
to
show
respect
to
the
station
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
so
he
and
Mr.
Harding
call
together
at
the
palace
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
at
home
,
and
the
two
visitor
be
show
through
the
accustomed
hall
into
the
well
-
know
room
where
the
good
old
bishop
use
to
sit
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
have
be
buy
at
a
valuation
,
and
every
chair
and
table
,
every
bookshelf
against
the
wall
,
and
every
square
in
the
carpet
be
as
well
known
to
each
of
them
as
their
own
bedroom
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
they
at
once
feel
that
they
be
stranger
there
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
for
the
most
part
the
same
,
yet
the
place
have
be
metamorphose
.
<EOS>
a
new
sofa
have
be
introduce
,
a
horrid
chintz
affair
,
most
unprelatical
and
almost
irreligious
;
such
a
sofa
as
never
yet
stand
in
the
study
of
any
decent
High
Church
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
the
old
curtain
have
also
give
way
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
to
be
sure
,
become
dingy
,
and
that
which
have
be
originally
a
rich
and
goodly
ruby
have
degenerate
into
a
reddish
brown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
think
the
old
reddish
-
brown
much
preferable
to
the
gaudy
buff
-
colour
trumpery
moreen
which
Mrs.
Proudie
have
deem
good
enough
for
her
husband
's
own
room
in
the
provincial
city
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
find
Dr.
Proudie
sit
on
the
old
bishop
's
chair
,
look
very
nice
in
his
new
apron
;
they
find
,
too
,
Mr.
Slope
stand
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
persuasive
and
eager
,
just
as
the
archdeacon
use
to
stand
;
but
on
the
sofa
they
also
find
Mrs.
Proudie
,
an
innovation
for
which
a
precedent
may
in
vain
be
seek
in
all
the
annal
of
the
Barchester
bishopric
!
  
<EOS>
there
she
be
,
however
,
and
they
could
only
make
the
good
of
her
.
<EOS>
the
introduction
be
go
through
in
much
form
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
shake
hand
with
the
bishop
,
and
name
Mr.
Harding
,
who
receive
such
an
amount
of
greeting
as
be
due
from
a
bishop
to
a
precentor
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
then
present
them
to
his
lady
wife
;
the
archdeacon
first
,
with
archidiaconal
honour
,
and
then
the
precentor
with
diminished
parade
.
<EOS>
after
this
Mr.
Slope
present
himself
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
it
be
true
,
do
mention
his
name
,
and
so
do
Mrs.
Proudie
too
,
in
a
loud
tone
,
but
Mr.
Slope
take
upon
himself
the
chief
burden
of
his
own
introduction
.
<EOS>
He
have
great
pleasure
in
make
himself
acquaint
with
Dr.
Grantly
;
he
have
hear
much
of
the
archdeacon
's
good
work
in
that
part
of
the
diocese
in
which
his
duty
as
archdeacon
have
be
exercise
(
thus
purposely
ignore
the
archdeacon
's
hitherto
unlimited
dominion
over
the
diocese
at
large
)
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
his
lordship
depend
greatly
on
the
assistance
which
Dr.
Grantly
would
be
able
to
give
him
in
that
portion
of
his
diocese
.
<EOS>
He
then
thrust
out
his
hand
and
,
grasp
that
of
his
new
foe
,
bedew
it
unmercifully
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
in
return
bow
,
look
stiff
,
contract
his
eyebrow
,
and
wipe
his
hand
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
nothing
abash
,
Mr.
Slope
then
notice
the
precentor
and
descend
to
the
grade
of
the
low
clergy
.
<EOS>
He
give
him
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
damp
indeed
,
but
affectionate
,
and
be
very
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
Mr.
 
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
Mr.
Harding
;
he
have
not
exactly
catch
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
Precentor
in
the
cathedral
,
"
surmise
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
confess
that
such
be
the
humble
sphere
of
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
some
parish
duty
as
well
,
"
suggest
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
acknowledge
the
diminutive
incumbency
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
then
leave
him
alone
,
have
condescend
sufficiently
,
and
join
the
conversation
among
the
high
power
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
four
person
there
,
each
of
whom
consider
himself
the
most
important
personage
in
the
diocese
 
himself
,
indeed
,
or
herself
,
as
Mrs.
Proudie
be
one
of
them
 
and
with
such
a
difference
of
opinion
it
be
not
probable
that
they
would
get
on
pleasantly
together
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
himself
actually
wear
the
visible
apron
,
and
trust
mainly
to
that
 
to
that
and
his
title
,
both
be
fact
which
could
not
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
know
his
subject
and
really
understand
the
business
of
bishoping
,
which
the
other
do
not
,
and
this
be
his
strong
ground
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
her
sex
to
back
her
,
and
her
habit
of
command
,
and
be
nothing
daunt
by
the
high
tone
of
Dr.
Grantly
's
face
and
figure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
only
himself
and
his
own
courage
and
tact
to
depend
on
,
but
he
nevertheless
be
perfectly
self
-
assure
,
and
do
not
doubt
but
that
he
should
soon
get
the
well
of
weak
man
who
trust
so
much
to
external
,
as
both
bishop
and
archdeacon
appear
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
reside
in
Barchester
,
Dr.
Grantly
?
"
ask
the
lady
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
explain
that
he
live
in
his
own
parish
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
a
few
mile
out
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
lady
hope
that
the
distance
be
not
too
great
for
country
visit
,
as
she
would
be
so
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
the
early
opportunity
,
after
the
arrival
of
her
horse
at
Barchester
;
their
horse
be
at
present
in
London
;
their
horse
be
not
immediately
come
down
,
as
the
bishop
would
be
oblige
,
in
a
few
day
,
to
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
be
no
doubt
aware
<EOS>
that
the
bishop
be
at
present
much
call
upon
by
the
"
University
Improvement
Committee
:
"
indeed
,
the
committee
could
not
well
proceed
without
him
,
as
their
final
report
have
now
to
be
draw
up
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
also
to
prepare
a
scheme
for
the
"
Manufacturing
Towns
Morning
and
Evening
Sunday
School
Society
,
"
of
which
he
be
a
patron
,
or
president
,
or
director
,
and
therefore
the
horse
would
not
come
down
to
Barchester
at
present
;
but
whenever
the
horse
do
come
down
,
she
would
take
the
early
opportunity
of
call
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
provide
the
distance
be
not
too
great
for
country
visit
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
make
his
fifth
bow
 
he
have
make
one
at
each
mention
of
the
horse
 
and
promise
that
Mrs.
grantly
would
do
herself
the
honour
of
call
at
the
palace
on
an
early
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
declare
that
she
would
be
delighted
:
she
have
not
like
to
ask
,
not
be
quite
sure
whether
Mrs.
Grantly
have
horse
;
besides
,
the
distance
may
have
be
,
&
c.
&
c.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
again
bow
but
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
buy
every
individual
possession
of
the
whole
family
of
the
proudie
and
have
restore
them
as
a
gift
,
without
much
feel
the
loss
;
and
have
keep
a
separate
pair
of
horse
for
the
exclusive
use
of
his
wife
since
the
day
of
his
marriage
,
whereas
Mrs.
Proudie
have
be
hitherto
job
about
the
street
of
London
at
so
much
a
month
,
during
the
season
,
and
at
other
time
have
manage
to
walk
,
or
hire
a
smart
fly
from
the
livery
stable
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
arrangement
with
reference
to
the
Sabbath
-
day
school
generally
pretty
good
in
your
archdeaconry
?
"
ask
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sabbath
-
day
school
!
"
repeat
the
archdeacon
with
an
affectation
of
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
I
can
not
tell
;
it
depend
mainly
on
the
parson
's
wife
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
at
plumstead
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
almost
a
fib
on
the
part
of
the
archdeacon
,
for
Mrs.
Grantly
have
a
very
nice
school
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
not
a
Sunday
-
school
exclusively
,
and
be
not
so
designate
,
but
that
exemplary
lady
always
attend
there
for
an
hour
before
church
,
and
hear
the
child
say
their
catechism
,
and
see
that
they
be
clean
and
tidy
for
church
,
with
their
hand
wash
and
their
shoe
tie
;
and
Grisel
and
Florinda
,
her
daughter
,
carry
thither
a
basket
of
large
bun
,
bake
on
the
Saturday
afternoon
,
and
distribute
them
to
all
the
child
not
especially
under
disgrace
,
which
bun
be
carry
home
after
church
with
considerable
content
,
and
eat
hot
at
tea
,
be
then
split
and
toast
.
<EOS>
the
child
of
plumstead
would
indeed
open
their
eye
if
they
hear
their
venerate
pastor
declare
that
there
be
no
Sunday
-
school
in
his
parish
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
merely
open
his
wide
eye
wide
and
slightly
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
however
,
prepare
to
give
up
his
darling
project
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
there
be
a
great
deal
of
Sabbath
travel
here
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
look
at
the
"
Bradshaw
,
"
I
see
that
there
be
three
train
in
and
three
out
every
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
Could
nothing
be
do
to
induce
the
company
to
withdraw
them
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
,
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
that
a
little
energy
may
diminish
the
evil
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
be
a
director
,
I
really
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
can
withdraw
the
passenger
,
the
company
I
dare
say
will
withdraw
the
train
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
merely
a
question
of
dividend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
surely
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
say
the
lady
;
"
surely
we
should
look
at
it
differently
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
for
instance
,
in
our
position
:
surely
we
should
do
all
that
we
can
to
control
so
grievous
a
sin
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
,
Mr.
Harding
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
turn
to
the
precentor
,
who
be
sit
mute
and
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
think
that

<EOS>
"
but
surely
,
surely
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
surely
that
be
not
enough
.
<EOS>
surely
that
will
not
secure
such
an
observance
of
the
Sabbath
as
we
be
teach
to
conceive
be
not
only
expedient
but
indispensable
<EOS>
;
surely
 
"
  
come
what
come
might
,
Dr.
Grantly
be
not
to
be
force
into
a
dissertation
on
a
point
of
doctrine
with
Mrs.
Proudie
,
nor
yet
with
Mr.
Slope
,
so
without
much
ceremony
he
turn
his
back
upon
the
sofa
and
begin
to
hope
that
Dr.
Proudie
have
find
that
the
palace
repair
have
be
such
as
to
meet
his
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
his
lordship
;
upon
the
whole
he
think
so
 
upon
the
whole
,
he
do
not
know
that
there
be
much
ground
for
complaint
;
the
architect
,
perhaps
,
may
have
 
but
<EOS>
his
double
,
Mr.
Slope
,
who
have
sidle
over
to
the
bishop
's
chair
,
would
not
allow
his
lordship
to
finish
his
ambiguous
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
point
I
would
like
to
mention
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
ask
me
to
step
through
the
premise
,
and
I
see
that
the
stall
in
the
second
stable
be
not
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
 
there
be
stand
there
for
a
dozen
horse
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
indeed
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
;
but
visitor
,
you
know
,
often
require
so
much
accommodation
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
of
the
bishop
's
relative
who
always
bring
their
own
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
promise
that
due
provision
for
the
relative
"
horse
should
be
make
,
as
far
at
least
as
the
extent
of
the
original
stable
building
would
allow
.
<EOS>
He
would
himself
communicate
with
the
architect
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
coach
-
house
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
;
"
there
be
really
hardly
room
for
a
second
carriage
in
the
large
coach
-
house
,
and
the
small
one
,
of
course
,
hold
only
one
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
gas
,
"
chime
in
the
lady
;
"
there
be
no
gas
through
the
house
,
<EOS>
none
whatever
,
but
in
the
kitchen
and
passage
.
<EOS>
surely
the
palace
should
have
be
fit
through
with
pipe
for
gas
,
and
hot
water
too
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
hot
water
lay
on
anywhere
above
the
ground
-
floor
;
surely
there
should
be
the
mean
of
get
hot
water
in
the
bedroom
without
have
it
bring
in
jug
from
the
kitchen
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
a
decide
opinion
that
there
should
be
pipe
for
hot
water
.
<EOS>
hot
water
be
very
essential
for
the
comfort
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
requisite
in
any
decent
gentleman
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
remark
that
the
coping
on
the
garden
wall
be
in
many
place
imperfect
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
discover
a
large
hole
,
<EOS>
evidently
the
work
of
rat
,
in
the
servant
"
hall
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
express
an
utter
detestation
of
rat
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
,
he
believe
,
in
this
world
that
he
so
much
hate
as
a
rat
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
,
moreover
,
observe
that
the
lock
of
the
outhouse
be
very
imperfect
:
he
may
specify
the
coal
-
cellar
and
the
woodhouse
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
also
see
that
those
on
the
door
of
the
servant
'
bedroom
be
in
an
-
equally
bad
condition
;
indeed
,
the
lock
all
through
the
house
be
old
-
fashioned
and
unserviceable
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
think
that
a
great
deal
depend
on
a
good
lock
and
quite
as
much
on
the
key
.
<EOS>
He
have
observe
that
the
fault
very
often
lie
with
the
key
,
especially
if
the
ward
be
in
any
way
twist
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
go
on
with
his
catalogue
of
grievance
,
when
he
be
somewhat
loudly
interrupt
by
the
archdeacon
,
who
succeed
in
explain
that
the
diocesan
architect
,
or
rather
his
foreman
,
be
the
person
to
be
address
on
such
subject
,
and
that
he
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
have
inquire
as
to
the
comfort
of
the
palace
merely
as
a
point
of
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
be
sorry
,
however
,
that
so
many
thing
have
be
find
amiss
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
rise
from
his
chair
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
though
she
have
contrive
to
lend
her
assistance
in
recapitulate
the
palatial
dilapidation
,
have
not
on
that
account
give
up
her
hold
of
Mr.
Harding
,
nor
cease
from
her
cross
-
examination
as
to
the
iniquity
of
sabbatical
amusement
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
have
she
throw
out
her
"
surely
,
surely
,
"
at
Mr.
Harding
's
devoted
head
,
and
ill
have
that
gentleman
be
able
to
parry
the
attack
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
never
before
find
himself
subject
to
such
a
nuisance
.
<EOS>
lady
hitherto
,
when
they
have
consult
him
on
religious
subject
,
have
listen
to
what
he
may
choose
to
say
with
some
deference
,
and
have
differ
,
if
they
differ
,
in
silence
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Proudie
interrogate
him
and
then
lecture
.
"
<EOS>
neither
thou
,
nor
thy
son
,
nor
thy
daughter
,
thy
manservant
,
nor
thy
maidservant
,
"
say
she
impressively
,
and
more
than
once
,
as
though
Mr.
Harding
have
forget
the
word
.
<EOS>
She
shake
her
finger
at
him
as
she
quote
the
favourite
law
,
as
though
menace
him
with
punishment
,
and
then
call
upon
him
categorically
to
state
whether
he
do
not
think
that
travel
on
the
Sabbath
be
an
abomination
and
a
desecration
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
never
be
so
hard
press
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
ought
to
rebuke
the
lady
for
presume
so
to
talk
to
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
many
year
her
senior
,
but
he
recoil
from
the
idea
of
scold
the
bishop
's
wife
,
in
the
bishop
's
presence
,
on
his
first
visit
to
the
palace
;
moreover
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
be
somewhat
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
,
see
him
sit
silent
and
absorb
,
by
no
mean
refrain
from
the
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mr.
Harding
,
"
say
she
,
shake
her
head
slowly
and
solemnly
,
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
leave
me
to
think
that
you
approve
of
Sabbath
travelling
,
"
and
she
look
a
look
of
unutterable
meaning
into
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
stand
this
,
for
Mr.
Slope
be
now
look
at
him
,
and
so
be
the
bishop
,
and
so
be
the
archdeacon
,
who
have
complete
his
adieux
on
that
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
therefore
get
up
also
and
,
put
out
his
hand
to
Mrs.
Proudie
,
say
:
"
if
you
will
come
to
St.
Cuthbert
's
<EOS>
some
Sunday
,
I
will
preach
you
a
sermon
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
archdeacon
and
the
precentor
take
their
departure
,
bow
low
to
the
lady
,
shake
hand
with
the
lord
,
and
escape
from
Mr.
Slope
in
the
good
manner
each
could
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
again
maltreat
,
but
Dr.
Grantly
swear
deeply
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
that
no
earthly
consideration
should
ever
again
induce
him
to
touch
the
paw
of
that
impure
and
filthy
animal
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
I
the
pen
of
a
mighty
poet
,
would
I
sing
in
epic
verse
the
noble
wrath
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
the
palace
step
descend
to
a
broad
gravel
sweep
,
from
whence
a
small
gate
open
out
into
the
street
,
very
near
the
covered
gateway
lead
into
the
close
.
<EOS>
the
road
from
the
palace
door
turn
to
the
left
,
through
the
spacious
garden
,
and
terminate
on
the
London
road
,
half
a
mile
from
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
till
they
have
both
pass
this
small
gate
and
enter
the
close
,
neither
of
them
speak
a
word
,
but
the
precentor
clearly
see
from
his
companion
's
face
that
a
tornado
be
to
be
expect
,
nor
be
he
himself
incline
to
stop
it
.
<EOS>
though
by
nature
far
less
irritable
than
the
archdeacon
,
even
he
be
angry
:
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
even
 
that
mild
and
courteous
man
 
be
incline
to
express
himself
in
anything
but
courteous
term
.
   
<EOS>
war
 
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
exclaim
the
archdeacon
,
as
he
place
his
foot
on
the
gravel
walk
of
the
close
,
and
raise
his
hat
with
one
hand
,
pass
the
other
somewhat
violently
over
his
now
grizzle
lock
;
smoke
issue
forth
from
the
uplifted
beaver
as
it
be
a
cloud
of
wrath
,
and
the
safety
valve
of
his
anger
open
,
and
emit
a
visible
steam
,
prevent
positive
explosion
and
probable
apoplexy
.
"
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
archdeacon
look
up
to
the
gray
pinnacle
of
the
cathedral
tower
,
make
a
mute
appeal
to
that
still
live
witness
which
have
look
down
on
the
doing
of
so
many
bishop
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
shall
ever
like
that
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
like
him
!
"
<EOS>
roar
the
archdeacon
,
stand
still
for
a
moment
to
give
more
force
to
his
voice
;
"
like
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
all
the
raven
of
the
close
caw
their
assent
.
<EOS>
the
old
bell
of
the
tower
,
in
chime
the
hour
,
echo
the
word
,
and
the
swallow
fly
out
from
their
nest
mutely
express
a
similar
opinion
.
<EOS>
like
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
why
no
,
it
be
not
very
probable
that
any
Barchester
-
breed
living
thing
should
like
Mr.
Slope
!
  
<EOS>
"
nor
Mrs.
Proudie
either
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
hereupon
forget
himself
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
follow
his
example
,
nor
shock
my
reader
by
transcribe
the
term
in
which
he
express
his
feeling
as
to
the
lady
who
have
be
name
.
<EOS>
the
raven
and
the
last
linger
note
of
the
clock
bell
be
less
scrupulous
and
repeat
in
correspondent
echo
the
very
improper
exclamation
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
again
raise
his
hat
,
and
another
salutary
escape
of
steam
be
effect
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
,
during
which
the
precentor
try
to
realize
the
fact
that
the
wife
of
a
Bishop
of
Barchester
have
be
thus
designate
,
in
the
close
of
the
cathedral
,
by
the
lip
of
its
own
archdeacon
;
but
he
could
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
seem
to
be
a
quiet
man
enough
,
"
suggest
Mr.
Harding
,
have
acknowledge
to
himself
his
own
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Idiot
!
"
exclaim
the
doctor
,
who
for
the
nonce
be
not
capable
of
more
than
such
spasmodic
attempt
at
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
do
not
seem
very
bright
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
"
and
yet
he
have
always
have
the
reputation
of
a
clever
man
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
be
cautious
and
not
inclined
to
express
himself
very
freely
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
new
Bishop
of
Barchester
be
already
so
contemptible
a
creature
in
Dr.
Grantly
's
eye
that
he
could
not
condescend
to
discuss
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
puppet
to
be
play
by
other
;
a
mere
wax
doll
,
do
up
in
an
apron
and
a
shovel
hat
,
to
be
stick
on
a
throne
or
elsewhere
,
and
pull
about
by
wire
as
other
choose
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
do
not
choose
to
let
himself
down
low
enough
to
talk
about
Dr.
Proudie
,
but
he
see
that
he
would
have
to
talk
about
the
other
member
of
his
household
,
the
coadjutor
bishop
,
who
have
bring
his
lordship
down
,
as
it
be
,
in
a
box
,
and
be
about
to
handle
the
wire
as
they
will
.
<EOS>
this
in
itself
be
a
terrible
vexation
to
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
ignore
the
chaplain
and
have
fight
the
bishop
,
there
would
have
be
,
at
any
rate
,
nothing
degrading
in
such
a
contest
.
<EOS>
let
the
Queen
make
whom
she
would
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
a
man
,
or
even
an
ape
,
when
once
a
bishop
,
would
be
a
respectable
adversary
,
if
he
would
but
fight
,
himself
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
such
a
person
as
Dr.
Grantly
to
do
when
such
another
person
as
Mr.
Slope
be
put
forward
as
his
antagonist
?
  
<EOS>
if
he
,
our
archdeacon
,
refuse
the
combat
,
Mr.
Slope
would
walk
triumphant
over
the
field
,
and
have
the
diocese
of
Barchester
under
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
archdeacon
accept
as
his
enemy
the
man
whom
the
new
puppet
bishop
put
before
him
as
such
,
he
would
have
to
talk
about
Mr.
Slope
,
and
write
about
Mr.
Slope
,
and
in
all
matter
treat
with
Mr.
Slope
,
as
a
be
stand
,
in
some
degree
,
on
ground
similar
to
his
own

<EOS>
He
would
have
to
meet
Mr.
Slope
,
to
 
Bah
!
<EOS>
the
idea
be
sicken
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
have
to
do
with
Mr.

<EOS>
"
He
be
the
most
thoroughly
bestial
creature
that
ever

set
my
eye
upon

again
caw
an

what
be
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
with
him
?
"
ask
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
what
be
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
how
be
we
to
treat
him
?
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
and
there
he
will
stay
.
<EOS>
He
have
put
his
foot
in
that
palace
,
and
he
will
never
take
it
out
again
till
he
be
drive
.
<EOS>
how
be
we
to
get
rid
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
he
can
do
us
much
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
do
harm
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
think
you
will
find
yourself
of
a
different
opinion
before
a
month
be
go
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
say
now
,
if
he
get
himself
put
into
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
Would
that
be
harm
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
muse
awhile
and
then
say
he
do
not
think
the
new
bishop
would
put
Mr.
Slope
into
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
do
not
put
him
there
,
he
will
put
him
somewhere
else
where
he
will
be
as
bad
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
that
man
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
will
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
!
"
<EOS>
and
again
Dr.
Grantly
raise
his
hat
and
rub
his
hand
thoughtfully
and
sadly
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
impudent
scoundrel
!
"
<EOS>
he
continue
after
a
while
.
"
<EOS>
to
dare
to
cross
-
examine
me
about
the
Sunday
-
school
in
the
diocese
,
and
Sunday
travel
too
:
I
never
in
my
life
meet
his
equal
for
sheer
impudence
.
<EOS>
why
,
he
must
have
think
we
be
two
candidate
for
ordination
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
think
Mrs.
Proudie
be
the
bad
of
the
two
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
a
woman
be
impertinent
,
one
must
only
put
up
with
it
,
and
keep
out
of
her
way
in
future

but
I
be
not
inclined
to
put
up
with
Mr.
Slope

"
<EOS>
Sabbath
travel
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
the
doctor
attempt
to
imitate
the
peculiar
drawl
of
the
man
he
so
much
dislike
:
"
"
Sabbath
travel
!
<EOS>
"
those
be
the
sort
of
man
who
will
ruin
the
Church
of
England
and
make
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
disreputable
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
dissenter
or
the
papist
that
we
should
fear
,
but
the
set
of
cant
,
low
-
breed
hypocrite
who
be
wriggle
their
way
in
among
us
;
man
who
have
no
fix
principle
,
no
standard
idea
of
religion
or
doctrine
,
but
who
take
up
some
popular
cry
,
as
this
fellow
have
do
about
"
Sabbath
travel
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Dr.
Grantly
do
not
again
repeat
the
question
aloud
,
but
he
do
so
constantly
to
himself
:
<EOS>
what
be
they
to
do
with
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
how
be
he
openly
,
before
the
world
,
to
show
that
he
utterly
disapprove
of
and
abhor
such
a
man
?
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Barchester
have
escape
the
taint
of
any
extreme
rigour
of
church
doctrine
.
<EOS>
the
clergyman
of
the
city
and
neighbourhood
,
though
very
well
inclined
to
promote
High
Church
principle
,
privilege
,
and
prerogative
,
have
never
commit
themselves
to
tendency
which
be
somewhat
too
loosely
call
puseyite
practice
.
<EOS>
They
all
preach
in
their
black
gown
,
as
their
father
have
do
before
them
;
they
wear
ordinary
black
cloth
waistcoat
;
they
have
no
candle
on
their
altar
,
either
light
or
unlighte
;
they
make
no
private
genuflexion
,
and
be
content
to
confine
themselves
to
such
ceremonial
observance
as
have
be
in
vogue
for
the
last
hundred
year
.
<EOS>
the
service
be
decently
and
demurely
read
in
their
parish
church
,
chant
be
confine
to
the
cathedral
,
and
the
science
of
intoning
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
one
young
man
who
have
come
direct
from
Oxford
as
a
curate
to
plumstead
have
,
after
the
lapse
of
two
or
three
Sundays
,
make
a
faint
attempt
,
much
to
the
bewilderment
of
the
poor
part
of
the
congregation
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
have
not
be
present
on
the
occasion
,
but
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
have
her
own
opinion
on
the
subject
,
immediately
after
the
service
express
a
hope
that
the
young
gentleman
have
not
be
take
ill
,
and
offer
to
send
him
all
kind
of
condiment
suppose
to
be
good
for
a
sore
throat
.
<EOS>
after
that
there
have
be
no
more
intoning
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
archdeacon
begin
to
meditate
on
some
strong
measure
of
absolute
opposition
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
and
his
crew
be
of
the
low
possible
order
of
Church
of
England
clergyman
,
and
therefore
it
behove
him
,
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
to
be
of
the
very
high
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
would
abolish
all
form
and
ceremony
,
and
therefore
Dr.
Grantly
feel
the
sudden
necessity
of
multiply
them
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
would
consent
to
deprive
the
church
of
all
collective
authority
and
rule
,
and
therefore
Dr.
Grantly
would
stand
up
for
the
full
power
of
convocation
and
the
renewal
of
all
its
ancient
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
could
not
himself
intone
the
service
,
but
he
could
procure
the
co
-
operation
of
any
number
of
gentlemanlike
curate
well
train
in
the
mystery
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
willingly
alter
his
own
fashion
of
dress
,
but
he
could
people
Barchester
with
young
clergyman
dress
in
the
long
frock
and
in
the
highest
-
breast
silk
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
be
not
prepared
to
cross
himself
,
or
to
advocate
the
real
presence
,
but
without
go
this
length
there
be
various
observance
,
by
adopt
which
he
could
plainly
show
his
antipathy
to
such
man
as
Dr.
Proudie
and
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
thing
pass
through
his
mind
as
he
pace
up
and
down
the
close
with
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
war
,
war
,
internecine
war
be
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
,
as
regard
himself
and
Mr.
Slope
,
one
of
the
two
must
be
annihilate
as
far
as
the
city
of
Barchester
be
concern
,
and
he
do
not
intend
to
give
way
until
there
be
not
leave
to
him
an
inch
of
ground
on
which
he
could
stand
.
<EOS>
He
still
flatter
himself
that
he
could
make
Barchester
too
hot
to
hold
Mr.
Slope
,
and
he
have
no
weakness
of
spirit
to
prevent
his
bringing
about
such
a
consummation
if
it
be
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Susan
must
call
at
the
palace
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
shall
call
there
,
but
it
shall
be
once
and
once
only
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
"
the
horse
"
will
not
find
it
convenient
to
come
out
to
Plumstead
very
soon
,
and
when
that
once
be
do
the
matter
may
drop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
Eleanor
need
call
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
Eleanor
would
get
on
at
all
well
with
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
the
least
necessity
in
life
,
"
reply
the
archdeacon
,
not
without
the
reflexion
that
a
ceremony
which
be
necessary
for
his
wife
may
not
be
at
all
bind
on
the
widow
of
John
Bold
.
"
<EOS>
not
the
slight
reason
on
earth
why
she
should
do
so
,
if
she
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
do
not
think
that
any
decent
young
woman
should
be
subject
to
the
nuisance
of
be
in
the
same
room
with
that
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
two
clergyman
part
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Harding
go
to
his
daughter
's
house
,
and
the
archdeacon
seek
the
seclusion
of
his
brougham
.
  
<EOS>
the
new
inhabitant
of
the
palace
do
not
express
any
high
opinion
of
their
visitor
than
their
visitor
have
express
of
them
.
<EOS>
though
they
do
not
use
quite
such
strong
language
as
Dr.
Grantly
have
do
,
they
feel
as
much
personal
aversion
,
and
be
quite
as
well
aware
as
he
be
that
there
would
be
a
battle
to
be
fight
,
and
that
there
be
hardly
room
for
Proudieism
in
Barchester
as
long
as
Grantlyism
be
predominant
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
may
be
doubt
whether
Mr.
Slope
have
not
already
within
his
breast
a
better
prepared
system
of
strategy
,
a
more
accurately
define
line
of
hostile
conduct
than
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
be
go
to
fight
because
he
find
that
he
hate
the
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
predetermine
to
hate
the
man
because
he
foresee
the
necessity
of
fight
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
first
review
the
_
carte
du
pay
_
previous
to
his
entry
into
Barchester
,
the
idea
have
occur
to
him
of
conciliate
the
archdeacon
,
of
cajole
and
flatter
him
into
submission
,
and
of
obtain
the
upper
hand
by
cunne
instead
of
courage
.
<EOS>
a
little
inquiry
,
however
,
suffice
to
convince
him
that
all
his
cunning
would
fail
to
win
over
such
a
man
as
Dr.
Grantly
to
such
a
mode
of
action
as
that
to
be
adopt
by
Mr.
Slope
,
and
then
he
determine
to
fall
back
upon
his
courage
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
see
that
open
battle
against
Dr.
Grantly
and
<EOS>
all
Dr.
Grantly
's
adherent
be
a
necessity
of
his
position
,
and
he
deliberately
plan
the
most
expedient
method
of
give
offence
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
his
arrival
the
bishop
have
intimate
to
the
dean
that
,
with
the
permission
of
the
canon
then
in
residence
,
his
chaplain
would
preach
in
the
cathedral
on
the
next
Sunday
.
<EOS>
the
canon
in
residence
happen
to
be
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
and
Rev.
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
,
who
at
this
time
be
very
busy
on
the
shore
of
the
Lake
of
Como
,
add
to
that
unique
collection
of
butterfly
for
which
he
be
so
famous
.
<EOS>
or
rather
,
he
would
have
be
in
residence
but
for
the
butterfly
and
other
such
summer
-
day
consideration
;
and
the
vicar
-
choral
,
who
be
to
take
his
place
in
the
pulpit
,
by
no
means
object
to
have
his
work
do
for
him
by
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
accordingly
preach
,
and
if
a
preacher
can
have
satisfaction
in
be
listen
to
,
Mr.
Slope
ought
to
have
be
gratify
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
that
he
be
gratify
,
and
that
he
leave
the
pulpit
with
the
conviction
that
he
have
do
what
he
intend
to
do
when
he
enter
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
the
new
bishop
take
his
seat
for
the
first
time
in
the
throne
allot
to
him
.
<EOS>
new
scarlet
cushion
and
drapery
have
be
prepare
,
with
new
gilt
binding
and
new
fringe
.
<EOS>
the
old
carved
oak
-
wood
of
the
throne
,
ascend
with
its
numerous
grotesque
pinnacle
half
-
way
up
to
the
roof
of
the
choir
,
have
be
wash
,
and
dust
,
and
rub
,
and
it
all
look
very
smart
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
often
sit
there
,
in
happy
early
day
,
on
those
lowly
bench
in
front
of
the
altar
,
have
I
while
away
the
tedium
of
a
sermon
in
consider
how
best
I
may
thread
my
way
up
amidst
those
wooden
tower
and
climb
safely
to
the
topmost
pinnacle
!
  
<EOS>
all
Barchester
go
to
hear
Mr.
Slope
;
either
for
that
or
to
gaze
at
the
new
bishop
.
<EOS>
all
the
good
bonnet
of
the
city
be
there
,
and
moreover
all
the
good
glossy
clerical
hat
.
<EOS>
not
a
stall
but
have
its
fitting
occupant
,
for
though
some
of
the
prebendary
may
be
away
in
Italy
or
elsewhere
,
their
place
be
fill
by
brother
who
flock
into
Barchester
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
dean
be
there
,
a
heavy
old
man
,
now
too
old
,
indeed
,
to
attend
frequently
in
his
place
,
and
so
be
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
so
also
be
the
chancellor
,
the
treasurer
,
the
precentor
,
sundry
canon
and
minor
canon
,
and
every
lay
member
of
the
choir
,
prepare
to
sing
the
new
bishop
in
with
due
melody
and
harmonious
expression
of
sacred
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
the
service
be
certainly
very
well
perform
.
<EOS>
such
be
always
the
case
at
Barchester
,
as
the
musical
education
of
the
choir
have
be
good
,
and
the
voice
have
be
carefully
select
.
<EOS>
the
psalm
be
beautifully
chant
;
the
Te
Deum
be
magnificently
sing
;
and
the
litany
be
give
in
a
manner
which
be
still
to
be
find
at
Barchester
,
but
,
if
my
taste
be
correct
,
be
to
be
find
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
the
litany
in
Barchester
cathedral
have
long
be
the
special
task
to
which
Mr.
Harding
's
skill
and
voice
have
be
devote
.
<EOS>
crowded
audience
generally
make
good
performer
,
and
though
Mr.
Harding
be
not
aware
of
any
extraordinary
exertion
on
his
part
,
yet
probably
he
rather
exceed
his
usual
mark
.
<EOS>
other
be
do
their
good
,
and
it
be
natural
that
he
should
emulate
his
brother
.
<EOS>
so
the
service
go
on
,
and
at
last
Mr.
Slope
get
into
the
pulpit
.
  
<EOS>
He
choose
for
his
text
a
verse
from
the
precept
address
by
St.
Paul
to
Timothy
,
as
to
the
conduct
necessary
in
a
spiritual
pastor
and
guide
,
and
it
be
immediately
evident
that
the
good
clergy
of
Barchester
be
to
have
a
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
"
study
to
show
thyself
approve
unto
God
,
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
,
rightly
divide
the
word
of
truth
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
word
of
his
text
,
and
with
such
a
subject
in
such
a
place
,
it
may
be
suppose
that
such
a
preacher
would
be
listen
to
by
such
an
audience
.
<EOS>
He
be
listen
to
with
breathless
attention
and
not
without
considerable
surprise
.
<EOS>
whatever
opinion
of
Mr.
Slope
may
have
be
hold
in
Barchester
before
he
commence
his
discourse
,
none
of
his
hearer
,
when
it
be
over
,
could
mistake
him
either
for
a
fool
or
a
coward
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
become
<EOS>
be
I
to
travesty
a
sermon
,
or
even
to
repeat
the
language
of
it
in
the
page
of
a
novel
.
<EOS>
in
endeavour
to
depict
the
character
of
the
person
of
whom
I
write
,
I
be
to
a
certain
extent
force
to
speak
of
sacred
thing
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
however
,
that
I
shall
not
be
think
to
scoff
at
the
pulpit
,
though
some
may
imagine
that
I
do
not
feel
all
the
reverence
that
be
due
to
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
I
may
question
the
infallibility
of
the
teacher
,
but
I
hope
that
I
shall
not
therefore
be
accuse
of
doubt
as
to
the
thing
to
be
teach
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
in
commence
his
sermon
,
show
no
slight
tact
in
his
ambiguous
manner
of
hint
that
,
humble
as
he
be
himself
,
he
stand
there
as
the
mouth
-
piece
of
the
illustrious
divine
who
sit
opposite
to
him
;
and
have
premise
so
much
,
he
give
forth
a
very
accurate
definition
of
the
conduct
which
that
prelate
would
rejoice
to
see
in
the
clergyman
now
bring
under
his
jurisdiction
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
necessary
to
say
that
the
peculiar
point
insist
upon
be
exactly
those
which
be
most
distasteful
to
the
clergy
of
the
diocese
,
and
most
averse
to
their
practice
and
opinion
,
and
that
all
those
peculiar
habit
and
privilege
which
have
always
be
dear
to
High
Church
priest
,
to
that
party
which
be
now
scandalously
call
the
"
high
and
dry
church
,
"
be
ridicule
,
abuse
,
and
anathematize
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
clergyman
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
be
all
of
the
high
and
dry
church
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
,
accord
to
his
own
opinion
,
explain
how
a
clergyman
should
show
himself
approve
unto
God
,
as
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
,
he
go
on
to
explain
how
the
word
of
truth
should
be
divide
;
and
here
he
take
a
rather
narrow
view
of
the
question
and
fetch
his
argument
from
afar
.
<EOS>
His
object
be
to
express
his
abomination
of
all
ceremonious
mode
of
utterance
,
to
cry
down
any
religious
feeling
which
may
be
excite
,
not
by
the
sense
,
but
by
the
sound
of
word
,
and
in
fact
to
insult
cathedral
practice
.
<EOS>
have
St.
Paul
speak
of
rightly
pronounce
,
instead
of
rightly
divide
the
word
of
truth
,
this
part
of
his
sermon
would
have
be
more
to
the
purpose
,
but
the
preacher
's
immediate
object
be
to
preach
Mr.
Slope
's
doctrine
,
and
not
St.
Paul
's
,
and
he
contrive
to
give
the
necessary
twist
to
the
text
with
some
skill
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
exactly
say
,
preach
from
a
cathedral
pulpit
,
that
chant
should
be
abandon
in
cathedral
service
.
<EOS>
by
such
an
assertion
he
would
have
overshoot
his
mark
and
render
himself
absurd
,
to
the
delight
of
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
however
,
and
do
,
allude
with
heavy
denunciation
to
the
practice
of
intone
in
parish
church
,
although
the
practice
be
all
but
unknown
in
the
diocese
;
and
from
thence
he
come
round
to
the
undue
preponderance
which
,
he
assert
,
music
have
over
meaning
in
the
beautiful
service
which
they
have
just
hear
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
,
he
say
,
that
the
practice
of
our
ancestor
could
not
be
abandon
at
a
moment
's
notice
;
the
feeling
of
the
aged
would
be
outrage
,
and
the
mind
of
respectable
man
would
be
shock
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
,
he
be
aware
,
of
not
sufficient
calibre
of
thought
to
perceive
,
of
not
sufficient
education
to
know
,
that
a
mode
of
service
which
be
effective
when
outward
ceremony
be
of
more
moment
than
inward
feeling
,
have
become
all
but
barbarous
at
a
time
when
inward
conviction
be
everything
,
when
each
word
of
the
minister
's
lip
should
fall
intelligibly
into
the
listener
's
heart
.
<EOS>
formerly
the
religion
of
the
multitude
have
be
an
affair
of
the
imagination
:
now
,
in
these
latter
day
,
it
have
become
necessary
that
a
Christian
should
have
a
reason
for
his
faith
 
should
not
only
believe
,
but
digest
 
not
only
hear
,
but
understand
.
<EOS>
the
word
of
our
morning
service
,
how
beautiful
,
how
apposite
,
how
intelligible
they
be
,
when
read
with
simple
and
distinct
decorum
!
<EOS>
but
how
much
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
be
lose
when
they
be
produce
with
all
the
meretricious
charm
of
melody
!
&
c.
&
c.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
sermon
to
be
preach
before
Mr.
Archdeacon
<EOS>
Grantly
,
Mr.
Precentor
Harding
,
and
the
rest
of
them
!
<EOS>
before
a
whole
dean
and
chapter
assemble
in
their
own
cathedral
!
<EOS>
before
man
who
have
grow
old
in
the
exercise
of
their
peculiar
service
,
with
a
full
conviction
of
their
excellence
for
all
intend
purpose
!
<EOS>
this
too
from
such
a
man
,
a
clerical
_
parvenu
_
,
a
man
without
a
cure
,
a
mere
chaplain
,
an
intruder
among
them
;
a
fellow
rake
up
,
so
say
Dr.
Grantly
,
from
the
gutter
of
Marylebone
!
<EOS>
They
have
to
sit
through
it
!
<EOS>
none
of
them
,
not
even
Dr.
Grantly
,
could
close
his
ear
,
nor
leave
the
house
of
God
during
the
hour
of
service
.
<EOS>
They
be
under
an
obligation
of
listening
,
and
that
too
without
any
immediate
power
of
reply
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
perhaps
,
no
great
hardship
at
present
inflict
on
mankind
in
civilized
and
free
country
than
the
necessity
of
listen
to
sermon
.
<EOS>
no
one
but
a
preach
clergyman
have
,
in
these
realm
,
the
power
of
compel
an
audience
to
sit
silent
and
be
torment
.
<EOS>
no
one
but
a
preach
clergyman
can
revel
in
platitude
,
truism
,
and
untruism
,
and
yet
receive
,
as
his
undisputed
privilege
,
the
same
respectful
demeanour
as
though
word
of
impassioned
eloquence
,
or
persuasive
logic
,
fall
from
his
lip
.
<EOS>
let
a
professor
of
law
or
physic
find
his
place
in
a
lecture
-
room
,
and
there
pour
forth
jejune
word
and
useless
empty
phrase
,
and
he
will
pour
them
forth
to
empty
bench
.
<EOS>
let
a
barrister
attempt
to
talk
without
talk
well
,
and
he
will
talk
but
seldom
.
<EOS>
a
judge
's
charge
nee
be
listen
to
perforce
by
none
but
the
jury
,
prisoner
,
and
gaoler
.
<EOS>
a
member
of
Parliament
can
be
cough
down
or
count
out
.
<EOS>
town
-
councillor
can
be
taboo
.
<EOS>
but
no
one
can
rid
himself
of
the
preach
clergyman
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
bore
of
the
age
,
the
old
man
whom
we
Sindbads
can
not
shake
off
,
the
nightmare
that
disturb
our
Sunday
's
rest
,
the
incubus
that
overload
our
religion
and
make
God
's
service
distasteful
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
force
into
church
!
<EOS>
no
:
<EOS>
but
we
desire
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
We
desire
not
to
be
force
to
stay
away
.
<EOS>
We
desire
,
nay
,
we
be
resolute
,
to
enjoy
the
comfort
of
public
worship
,
but
we
desire
also
that
we
may
do
so
without
an
amount
of
tedium
which
ordinary
human
nature
can
not
endure
with
patience
;
that
we
may
be
able
to
leave
the
house
of
God
without
that
anxious
longing
for
escape
which
be
the
common
consequence
of
common
sermon
.
  
<EOS>
with
what
complacency
will
a
young
parson
deduce
false
conclusion
from
misunderstood
text
,
and
then
threaten
us
with
all
the
penalty
of
Hades
if
we
neglect
to
comply
with
the
injunction
he
have
give
us
!
<EOS>
yes
,
my
too
self
-
confident
juvenile
friend
,
I
do
believe
in
those
mystery
which
be
so
common
in
your
mouth
;
I
do
believe
in
the
unadulterated
word
which
you
hold
there
in
your
hand
;
but
you
must
pardon
me
if
,
in
some
thing
,
I
doubt
your
interpretation
.
<EOS>
the
Bible
be
good
,
the
prayer
-
book
be
good
,
nay
,
you
yourself
would
be
acceptable
,
if
you
would
read
to
me
some
portion
of
those
time
-
honour
discourse
which
our
great
divine
have
elaborate
in
the
full
maturity
of
their
power
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
excuse
me
,
my
insufficient
young
lecturer
,
if
I
yawn
over
your
imperfect
sentence
,
your
repeat
phrase
,
your
false
pathos
,
your
drawling
and
denouncing
,
your
humming
and
hawing
,
your
oh
-
e
and
ah
-
ing
,
your
black
glove
and
your
white
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
it
all
mean
nothing
;
and
hour
be
too
precious
to
be
so
waste
 
if
one
could
only
avoid
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
make
a
protest
against
the
pretence
,
so
often
put
forward
by
the
work
clergy
,
that
they
be
overburden
by
the
multitude
of
sermon
to
be
preach
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
too
fond
of
our
own
voice
,
and
a
preacher
be
encourage
in
the
vanity
of
make
his
hear
by
the
privilege
of
a
compel
audience
.
<EOS>
His
sermon
be
the
pleasant
morsel
of
his
life
,
his
delicious
moment
of
self
-
exaltation
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
preach
nine
sermon
this
week
,
"
say
a
young
friend
to
me
the
other
day
,
with
hand
languidly
raise
to
his
brow
,
the
picture
of
an
overburdened
martyr
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nine
this
week
,
seven
last
week
,
four
the
week
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
preach
twenty
-
three
sermon
this
month
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
too
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
too
much
,
indeed
,
"
say
I
,
shudder
;
"
too
much
for
the
strength
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
answer
meekly
,
"
indeed
it
be
;
I
be
begin
to
feel
it
painfully
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
could
feel
it
 
would
that
you
could
be
make
to
feel
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
never
guess
that
my
heart
be
wrung
for
the
poor
listener
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
at
any
rate
,
no
tedium
feel
in
listen
to
Mr.
Slope
on
the
occasion
in
question
.
<EOS>
His
subject
come
too
home
to
his
audience
to
be
dull
,
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mr.
Slope
have
the
gift
of
use
word
forcibly
.
<EOS>
He
be
hear
through
his
thirty
minute
of
eloquence
with
mute
attention
and
open
ear
,
but
with
angry
eye
,
which
glare
round
from
one
enraged
parson
to
another
,
with
wide
-
spread
nostril
from
which
already
burst
forth
fume
of
indignation
,
and
with
many
shuffling
of
the
foot
and
uneasy
motion
of
the
body
,
which
betoken
mind
disturb
,
and
heart
not
at
peace
with
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
bishop
,
who
,
of
all
the
congregation
,
have
be
most
surprised
,
and
whose
hair
almost
stand
on
end
with
terror
,
give
the
blessing
in
a
manner
not
at
all
equal
to
that
in
which
he
have
long
be
practise
it
in
his
own
study
,
and
the
congregation
be
free
to
go
their
way
.
   
<EOS>
the
Dean
and
Chapter
Take
counsel
 
<EOS>
all
Barchester
be
in
a
tumult
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
could
hardly
get
himself
out
of
the
cathedral
porch
before
he
explode
in
his
wrath
.
<EOS>
the
old
dean
betook
himself
silently
to
his
deanery
,
afraid
to
speak
,
and
there
sit
,
half
-
stupefy
,
ponder
many
thing
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
creep
forth
solitary
and
unhappy
;
and
,
slowly
pass
beneath
the
elm
of
the
close
,
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
believe
that
the
word
which
he
have
hear
have
proceed
from
the
pulpit
of
Barchester
cathedral
.
<EOS>
be
he
again
to
be
disturb
?
<EOS>
be
his
whole
life
to
be
show
up
as
a
useless
sham
a
second
time
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
to
abdicate
his
precentorship
,
as
he
have
his
wardenship
,
and
to
give
up
chant
,
as
he
have
give
up
his
twelve
old
bedesman
?
<EOS>
and
what
if
he
do
!
<EOS>
some
other
Jupiter
,
some
other
Mr.
Slope
,
would
come
and
turn
him
out
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
surely
he
could
not
have
be
wrong
all
his
life
in
chant
the
litany
as
he
have
do
!
<EOS>
He
begin
,
however
,
to
have
his
doubt
.
<EOS>
doubt
himself
be
Mr.
Harding
's
weakness
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
however
,
the
usual
fault
of
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
all
Barchester
be
in
a
tumult
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
the
clergy
who
be
affect
.
<EOS>
the
laity
also
have
listen
to
Mr.
Slope
's
new
doctrine
,
all
with
surprise
,
some
with
indignation
,
and
some
with
a
mixed
feeling
,
in
which
dislike
of
the
preacher
be
not
so
strongly
blended
.
<EOS>
the
old
bishop
and
his
chaplain
,
the
dean
and
his
canon
and
minor
canon
,
the
old
choir
,
and
especially
Mr.
Harding
who
be
at
the
head
of
it
,
have
all
be
popular
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
They
have
spend
their
money
and
do
good
;
the
poor
have
not
be
grind
down
;
the
clergy
in
society
have
neither
be
overbear
nor
austere
;
and
the
whole
repute
of
the
city
be
due
to
its
ecclesiastical
importance
.
<EOS>
yet
there
be
those
who
have
hear
Mr.
Slope
with
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
pleasant
to
receive
a
fillip
of
excitement
when
suffer
from
the
dull
routine
of
everyday
life
!
<EOS>
the
anthem
and
Te
deum
be
in
themselves
delightful
,
but
they
have
be
hear
so
often
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
certainly
not
delightful
,
but
he
be
new
,
and
,
moreover
,
clever
.
<EOS>
They
have
long
think
it
slow
,
so
say
now
many
of
the
Barchesterians
,
to
go
on
as
they
have
do
in
their
old
humdrum
way
,
give
ear
to
none
of
the
religious
change
which
be
move
the
world
without
.
<EOS>
People
in
advance
of
the
age
now
have
new
idea
,
and
it
be
quite
time
that
Barchester
should
go
in
advance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
may
be
right
.
<EOS>
Sunday
have
certainly
not
be
strictly
keep
in
Barchester
,
except
as
regard
the
cathedral
service
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
two
hour
between
service
have
long
be
appropriate
to
morning
call
and
hot
luncheon
.
<EOS>
then
,
Sunday
-
school
!
<EOS>
really
more
ought
to
have
be
do
as
to
Sunday
-
school
 
Sabbath
-
day
school
Mr.
Slope
have
call
them
.
<EOS>
the
late
bishop
have
really
not
think
of
Sunday
-
school
as
he
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
(
these
people
probably
do
not
reflect
that
catechism
and
collect
be
quite
as
hard
work
to
the
young
mind
as
bookkeepe
be
to
the
elderly
,
and
that
quite
as
little
feeling
of
worship
enter
into
the
one
task
as
the
other
.
)
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
regard
that
great
question
of
musical
service
,
there
may
be
much
to
be
say
on
Mr.
Slope
's
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
the
fact
that
people
go
to
the
cathedral
to
hear
the
music
,
&
c.
&
c
  
<EOS>
and
so
a
party
absolutely
form
itself
in
Barchester
on
Mr.
Slope
's
side
of
the
question
!
<EOS>
this
consist
,
among
the
upper
class
,
chiefly
of
lady
.
<EOS>
no
man
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
no
gentleman
 
could
possibly
be
attract
by
Mr.
Slope
,
or
consent
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
so
abhorrent
a
Gamaliel
.
<EOS>
lady
be
sometimes
less
nice
in
their
appreciation
of
physical
disqualification
;
provide
that
a
man
speak
to
them
well
,
they
will
listen
,
though
he
speak
from
a
mouth
never
so
deformed
and
hideous
.
<EOS>
Wilkes
be
most
fortunate
as
a
lover
,
and
the
damp
,
sandy
-
haired
,
saucer
-
eyed
,
red
-
fiste
Mr.
Slope
be
powerful
only
over
the
female
breast
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
one
or
two
of
the
neighbour
clergy
who
think
it
not
quite
safe
to
neglect
the
basket
in
which
for
the
nonce
be
store
the
loaf
and
fish
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
They
,
and
they
only
,
come
to
call
on
Mr.
Slope
after
his
performance
in
the
cathedral
pulpit
.
<EOS>
among
these
Mr.
Quiverful
,
the
rector
of
Puddingdale
,
whose
wife
still
continue
to
present
him
from
year
to
year
with
fresh
pledge
of
her
love
,
and
so
to
increase
his
care
and
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
his
happiness
equally
.
<EOS>
who
can
wonder
that
a
gentleman
with
fourteen
live
child
and
a
bare
income
of
£
400
a
year
should
look
after
the
loaf
and
fish
,
even
when
they
be
under
the
thumb
of
a
Mr.
Slope
?
  
<EOS>
very
soon
after
the
Sunday
on
which
the
sermon
be
preach
,
the
lead
clergy
of
the
neighbourhood
hold
high
debate
together
as
to
how
Mr.
Slope
should
be
put
down
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
should
never
again
preach
from
the
pulpit
of
Barchester
cathedral
.
<EOS>
this
be
Dr.
Grantly
's
early
dictum
,
and
they
all
agree
,
provide
only
that
they
have
the
power
to
exclude
him
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
declare
that
the
power
rest
with
the
dean
and
chapter
,
observe
that
no
clergyman
out
of
the
chapter
have
a
claim
to
preach
there
,
save
only
the
bishop
himself
.
<EOS>
to
this
the
dean
assent
,
but
allege
that
contest
on
such
a
subject
would
be
unseemly
;
to
which
rejoin
a
meagre
little
doctor
,
one
of
the
cathedral
prebendary
,
that
the
contest
must
be
all
on
the
side
of
Mr.
Slope
if
every
prebendary
be
always
there
ready
to
take
his
own
place
in
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
cunne
little
meagre
doctor
,
whom
it
suit
well
to
live
in
his
own
cosy
house
within
Barchester
close
,
and
who
be
well
content
to
have
his
little
fling
at
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
and
other
absentee
,
whose
italian
villas
,
or
entice
London
home
,
be
more
tempting
than
cathedral
stall
and
residence
!
  
<EOS>
to
this
answer
the
burly
chancellor
,
a
man
rather
silent
indeed
,
but
very
sensible
,
that
absent
prebendary
have
their
vicar
,
and
that
in
such
case
the
vicar
's
right
to
the
pulpit
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
high
order
.
<EOS>
to
which
the
dean
assent
,
groan
deeply
at
these
truth
.
<EOS>
thereupon
,
however
,
the
meagre
doctor
remark
that
they
would
be
in
the
hand
of
their
minor
canon
,
one
of
whom
may
at
any
hour
betray
his
trust
.
<EOS>
Whereon
be
hear
from
the
burly
chancellor
an
ejaculation
sound
somewhat
like
"
pooh
,
pooh
,
pooh
!
"
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
that
the
worthy
man
be
but
blow
out
the
heavy
breath
from
his
windpipe
.
<EOS>
why
silence
him
at
all
?
<EOS>
suggest
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
let
them
not
be
ashamed
to
hear
what
any
man
may
have
to
preach
to
them
,
unless
he
preach
false
doctrine
;
in
which
case
,
let
the
bishop
silence
him
.
<EOS>
so
speak
our
friend
;
vainly
;
for
human
end
must
be
attain
by
human
mean
.
<EOS>
but
the
dean
see
a
ray
of
hope
out
of
those
purblind
old
eye
of
his
.
<EOS>
yes
,
let
them
tell
the
bishop
how
distasteful
to
them
be
this
Mr.
Slope
:
<EOS>
a
new
bishop
just
come
to
his
seat
could
not
wish
to
insult
his
clergy
while
the
gloss
be
yet
fresh
on
his
first
apron
.
  
<EOS>
then
up
rise
Dr.
Grantly
and
,
have
thus
collect
the
scattered
wisdom
of
his
associate
,
speak
forth
with
word
of
deep
authority
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
up
rise
the
archdeacon
,
I
speak
of
the
inner
man
,
which
then
spring
up
to
more
immediate
action
,
for
the
doctor
have
bodily
be
stand
all
along
with
his
back
to
the
dean
's
empty
fire
-
grate
,
and
the
tail
of
his
frock
coat
support
over
his
two
arm
.
<EOS>
His
hand
be
in
his
breech
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
clear
that
this
man
must
not
be
allow
to
preach
again
in
this
cathedral
.
<EOS>
We
all
see
that
,
except
our
dear
friend
here
,
the
milk
of
whose
nature
run
so
softly
that
he
would
not
have
the
heart
to
refuse
the
Pope
<EOS>
the
loan
of
his
pulpit
,
if
the
Pope
would
come
and
ask
it
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
,
however
,
allow
the
man
to
preach
again
here
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
because
his
opinion
on
church
matter
may
be
different
from
our
 
with
that
one
would
not
quarrel
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
he
have
purposely
insult
us
.
<EOS>
when
he
go
up
into
that
pulpit
last
Sunday
,
his
studied
object
be
to
give
offence
to
man
who
have
grow
old
in
reverence
of
those
thing
of
which
he
dare
to
speak
so
slightingly
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
to
come
here
a
stranger
,
a
young
,
unknown
,
and
unfriended
stranger
,
and
tell
us
,
in
the
name
of
the
bishop
his
master
,
that
we
be
ignorant
of
our
duty
,
old
-
fashioned
,
and
useless
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
most
to
admire
his
courage
or
his
impudence
!
<EOS>
and
one
thing
I
will
tell
you
:
that
sermon
originate
solely
with
the
man
himself
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
no
more
a
party
to
it
than
be
the
dean
here
.
<EOS>
You
all
know
how
grieved
I
be
to
see
a
bishop
in
this
diocese
hold
the
latitudinarian
idea
by
which
Dr.
Proudie
have
make
himself
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
You
all
know
how
greatly
I
should
distrust
the
opinion
of
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
matter
I
hold
him
to
be
blameless
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Dr.
Proudie
have
live
too
long
among
gentleman
to
be
guilty
,
or
to
instigate
another
to
be
guilty
,
of
so
gross
an
outrage
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
that
man
utter
what
be
untrue
when
he
hint
that
he
be
speak
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
suit
his
ambitious
view
at
once
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
to
us
 
at
once
to
defy
us
here
in
the
quiet
of
our
own
religious
duty
 
here
within
the
wall
of
our
own
loved
cathedral
 
here
where
we
have
for
so
many
year
exercise
our
ministry
without
schism
and
with
good
repute
.
<EOS>
such
an
attack
upon
us
,
come
from
such
a
quarter
,
be
abominable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
abominable
,
"
groan
the
dean
.
"
<EOS>
abominable
,
"
mutter
the
meagre
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
abominable
,
"
re
-
echo
the
chancellor
,
utter
the
sound
from
the
bottom
of
his
deep
chest
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
it
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
most
abominable
and
most
unjustifiable
,
"
continue
the
archdeacon
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
Dean
,
thank
God
,
that
pulpit
be
still
our
own
:
<EOS>
your
own
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
that
pulpit
belong
solely
to
the
dean
and
chapter
of
Barchester
Cathedral
,
and
as
yet
Mr.
Slope
be
no
part
of
that
chapter
.
<EOS>
You
,
Mr.
Dean
,
have
suggest
that
we
should
appeal
to
the
bishop
to
abstain
from
force
this
man
on
us
;
but
what
if
the
bishop
allow
himself
to
be
rule
by
his
chaplain
?
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
the
matter
be
in
our
own
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
can
not
preach
there
without
permission
ask
and
obtain
,
and
let
that
permission
be
invariably
refuse
.
<EOS>
let
all
participation
in
the
ministry
of
the
cathedral
service
be
refuse
to
him
.
<EOS>
then
,
if
the
bishop
choose
to
interfere
,
we
shall
know
what
answer
to
make
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
My
friend
here
have
suggest
that
this
man
may
again
find
his
way
into
the
pulpit
by
undertake
the
duty
of
some
of
your
minor
canon
,
but
I
be
sure
that
we
may
fully
trust
to
these
gentleman
to
support
us
,
when
it
be
know
that
the
dean
object
to
any
such
transfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
may
,
"
say
the
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
more
discussion
among
the
learn
conclave
,
all
of
which
,
of
course
,
end
in
obedience
to
the
archdeacon
's
command
.
<EOS>
They
have
too
long
be
accustomed
to
his
rule
to
shake
it
off
so
soon
,
and
in
this
particular
case
they
have
none
of
them
a
wish
to
abet
the
man
whom
he
be
so
anxious
to
put
down
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
meeting
as
that
we
have
just
record
be
not
hold
in
such
a
city
as
Barchester
unknown
and
untold
of
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
the
fact
of
the
meeting
talk
of
in
every
respectable
house
,
include
the
palace
,
but
the
very
speech
of
the
dean
,
the
archdeacon
,
and
chancellor
be
repeat
;
not
without
many
addition
and
imaginary
circumstance
,
accord
to
the
taste
and
opinion
of
the
relater
.
  
<EOS>
all
,
however
,
agree
in
say
that
Mr.
Slope
be
to
be
debar
from
open
his
mouth
in
the
cathedral
of
Barchester
;
many
believe
that
the
verger
be
to
be
order
to
refuse
him
even
the
accommodation
of
a
seat
;
and
some
of
the
most
far
-
go
advocate
for
strong
measure
declare
that
his
sermon
be
look
upon
as
an
indictable
offence
,
and
that
proceeding
be
to
be
take
against
him
for
brawl
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
who
be
incline
to
defend
him
 
the
enthusiastically
religious
young
lady
and
the
middle
-
age
spinster
desirous
of
a
move
 
<EOS>
of
course
take
up
his
defence
the
more
warmly
on
account
of
this
attack
.
<EOS>
if
they
could
not
hear
Mr.
Slope
in
the
cathedral
,
they
would
hear
him
elsewhere
;
they
would
leave
the
dull
dean
,
the
dull
old
prebendary
,
and
the
scarcely
less
dull
young
minor
canon
to
preach
to
each
other
;
they
would
work
slipper
and
cushion
and
hem
band
for
Mr.
Slope
,
make
him
a
happy
martyr
,
and
stick
him
up
in
some
new
Sion
or
Bethesda
,
and
put
the
cathedral
quite
out
of
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Proudie
at
once
return
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
think
it
expedient
not
to
have
to
encounter
any
personal
application
from
the
dean
and
chapter
respect
the
sermon
till
the
violence
of
the
storm
have
expend
itself
;
but
they
leave
Mr.
Slope
behind
them
nothing
daunt
,
and
he
go
about
his
work
zealously
,
flatter
such
as
would
listen
to
his
flattery
,
whisper
religious
twaddle
into
the
ear
of
foolish
woman
,
ingratiate
himself
with
the
few
clergy
who
would
receive
him
,
visit
the
house
of
the
poor
,
inquire
into
all
people
,
pry
into
everything
,
and
search
with
his
minute
eye
into
all
palatial
dilapidation
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
make
any
immediate
attempt
to
preach
again
in
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
all
Barchester
be
by
the
ear
.
   
<EOS>
the
Ex
-
warden
rejoice
in
His
probable
return
to
the
hospital
 
<EOS>
among
the
lady
in
Barchester
who
have
hitherto
acknowledge
Mr.
Slope
as
their
spiritual
director
must
not
be
reckon
either
the
Widow
Bold
or
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
outbreak
of
the
wrath
of
the
denizen
of
the
close
,
none
have
be
more
animate
against
the
intruder
than
these
two
lady
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
natural
.
<EOS>
who
could
be
so
proud
of
the
musical
distinction
of
their
own
cathedral
as
the
favourite
daughter
of
the
precentor
?
<EOS>
who
would
be
so
likely
to
resent
an
insult
offer
to
the
old
choir
?
<EOS>
and
in
such
matter
Miss
Bold
and
her
sister
-
in
-
law
have
but
one
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
this
wrath
,
however
,
have
in
some
degree
be
mitigate
,
and
I
regret
to
say
that
these
lady
allow
Mr.
Slope
to
be
his
own
apologist
.
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
after
the
sermon
have
be
preach
,
they
be
both
of
them
not
a
little
surprised
by
hear
Mr.
Slope
announce
,
as
the
page
in
button
open
Mrs.
Bold
's
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
what
living
man
could
,
by
a
mere
morning
visit
,
have
surprise
them
more
?
<EOS>
here
be
the
great
enemy
of
all
that
be
good
in
Barchester
come
into
their
own
drawing
-
room
,
and
they
have
no
strong
arm
,
no
ready
tongue
,
near
at
hand
for
their
protection
.
<EOS>
the
widow
snatch
her
baby
out
of
its
cradle
into
her
lap
,
and
Mary
Bold
stand
up
ready
to
die
manfully
in
that
baby
's
behalf
,
should
,
under
any
circumstance
,
such
a
sacrifice
become
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
be
Mr.
Slope
receive
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
leave
,
he
be
allow
by
each
lady
to
take
her
hand
and
to
make
his
adieux
as
gentleman
do
who
have
be
graciously
entertain
!
<EOS>
yes
,
he
shake
hand
with
them
,
and
be
curtsey
out
courteously
,
the
button
page
open
the
door
as
he
would
have
do
for
the
good
canon
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
touch
the
baby
's
little
hand
and
bless
him
with
a
fervid
blessing
;
he
have
speak
to
the
widow
of
her
early
sorrow
,
and
Eleanor
's
silent
tear
have
not
rebuke
him
;
he
have
tell
Mary
Bold
that
her
devotion
would
be
reward
,
and
Mary
Bold
have
hear
the
praise
without
disgust
.
<EOS>
and
how
have
he
do
all
this
?
<EOS>
how
have
he
so
quickly
turn
aversion
into
,
at
any
rate
,
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
how
have
he
over
-
come
the
enmity
with
which
these
lady
have
be
ready
to
receive
him
,
and
make
his
peace
with
them
so
easily
?
  
<EOS>
My
reader
will
guess
from
what
I
have
write
that
I
myself
do
not
like
Mr.
Slope
,
but
I
be
constrain
to
admit
that
he
be
a
man
of
part
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
to
say
a
soft
word
in
the
proper
place
;
he
know
how
to
adapt
his
flattery
to
the
ear
of
his
hearer
;
he
know
the
wile
of
the
serpent
,
and
he
use
them
.
<EOS>
Could
Mr.
Slope
have
adapt
his
manner
to
man
as
well
as
to
woman
,
could
he
ever
have
learn
the
way
of
a
gentleman
,
he
may
have
rise
to
great
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
commence
his
acquaintance
with
Eleanor
by
praise
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
he
say
,
become
aware
that
he
have
unfortunately
offend
the
feeling
of
a
man
of
whom
he
could
not
speak
too
highly
;
he
would
not
now
allude
to
a
subject
which
be
probably
too
serious
for
draw
-
room
conversation
,
but
he
would
say
that
it
have
be
very
far
from
him
to
utter
a
word
in
disparagement
of
a
man
of
whom
<EOS>
all
the
world
,
at
least
the
clerical
world
,
speak
so
highly
as
it
do
of
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
on
,
unsay
a
great
deal
of
his
sermon
,
express
his
high
admiration
for
the
precentor
's
musical
talent
,
eulogize
the
father
and
the
daughter
and
the
sister
-
in
-
law
,
speak
in
that
low
silky
whisper
which
he
always
have
specially
prepare
for
feminine
ear
,
and
,
ultimately
,
gain
his
object
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
,
he
express
a
hope
that
he
may
again
be
allow
to
call
;
and
though
Eleanor
give
no
verbal
assent
to
this
,
she
do
not
express
dissent
:
and
so
Mr.
Slope
's
right
to
visit
at
the
widow
's
house
be
establish
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
this
visit
Eleanor
tell
her
father
of
it
and
express
an
opinion
that
Mr.
Slope
be
not
quite
so
black
as
he
have
be
paint
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
open
his
eye
rather
wider
than
usual
when
he
hear
what
have
occur
,
but
he
say
little
;
he
could
not
agree
in
any
praise
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
it
be
not
his
practice
to
say
much
evil
of
anyone
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
like
the
visit
,
and
simple
-
minded
as
he
be
,
he
feel
sure
that
Mr.
Slope
have
some
deep
motive
than
the
mere
pleasure
of
make
soft
speech
to
two
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
have
come
to
see
his
daughter
with
other
purpose
than
that
of
speak
either
good
or
evil
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
tell
her
that
the
place
of
warden
in
Hiram
's
hospital
be
again
to
be
fill
up
,
and
that
in
all
probability
he
would
once
more
return
to
his
old
home
and
his
twelve
bedesman
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
he
,
laugh
,
"
I
shall
be
greatly
shorn
of
my
ancient
glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
,
Papa

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this

<EOS>

four
hundred

she
,
"
instead
of
eight
hundred

<EOS>
well
,
that
be
rather
shabby

<EOS>
but
still
,
Papa

you
will
have
the

old
house

the
garden

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear

"
say
he
,
"
it
be
worth
twice
the

and
as
he
speak
he
show
a
jaunty
kind
of
satisfaction
in
his
tone
and
manner
and
in
the
quick
,
pleasant
way
in
which
he
pace
Eleanor
's
drawing

room
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
worth
twice
the
money

<EOS>
I
shall
have
the
house

the
garden

a
large
income
than
I
can
possibly
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
you
will
have
no
extravagant
daughter
to
provide
for
;
"
and
as
she
speak
,
the
young
widow
put
her
arm
within
his
,
and
make
him
sit
on
the
sofa
beside
her
;
"
at
any
rate
,
you
will
not
have
that
expense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my

and
I
shall
be
rather
lonely
without
her

but
we
will
not
think
of
that
now

<EOS>
as
regard
income

I
shall
have
plenty
for
all
I

I
shall
have
my

I
do
not

own

feel
sometimes
the
inconvenience
of
live
in
a
lodging

<EOS>
lodging
be
very
nice
for
young
man
,
but
at
my
time
of
life
there
be
a
want
of
 
I
hardly
know
what
to
call
it
,
perhaps
not
respectability
 
"
  
"
oh
,
Papa

<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
be
nothing
like
that

<EOS>
nobody

nobody

nobody

not
the

the
archdeacon
out

Plumstead

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
archdeacon
would
not

much
oblige
to
you

he

smile
somewhat
at
the
exclusive
manner
in

at

softly

I

new

there
be

where

I

"
  
<EOS>

,
Papa

I
tell
you
fairly

I

<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
,
my
dear
;
that
is
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
go
to
build
another
house
for
the
matron
and
the
woman
,
and
I
believe
they
have
not
even
fix
yet
on
the
site
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
they
appoint
the
matron
?
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
not
appoint
the
warden
yet
,
"
reply
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
no
doubt
about
that
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
explain
that
he
think
there
be
no
doubt
;
that
the
archdeacon
have
declare
as
much
,
say
that
the
bishop
and
his
chaplain
between
them
have
not
the
power
to
appoint
anyone
else
,
even
if
they
have
the
will
to
do
so
,
and
sufficient
impudence
to
carry
out
such
a
will
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
of
opinion
that
,
though
Mr.
Harding
have
resign
his
wardenship
,
and
have
do
so
unconditionally
,
he
have
do
so
under
circumstance
which
leave
the
bishop
no
choice
as
to
his
reappointment
,
now
that
the
affair
of
the
hospital
have
be
settle
on
a
new
basis
by
act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
archdeacon
's
opinion
,
and
his
father
-
in
-
law
receive
it
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
have
always
be
strongly
opposed
to
Mr.
Harding
's
resignation
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
all
in
his
power
to
dissuade
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
consider
that
Mr.
Harding
be
bind
to
withstand
the
popular
clamour
with
which
he
be
attack
for
receive
so
large
an
income
as
eight
hundred
a
year
from
such
a
charity
,
and
be
not
even
yet
satisfied
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
conduct
have
not
be
pusillanimous
and
undignified
.
<EOS>
He
look
also
on
this
reduction
of
the
warden
's
income
as
a
shabby
,
paltry
scheme
on
the
part
of
government
for
escape
from
a
difficulty
into
which
it
have
be
bring
by
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
observe
that
the
government
have
no
more
right
to
dispose
of
a
sum
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
year
out
of
the
income
of
Hiram
's
legacy
than
of
nine
hundred
;
whereas
,
as
he
say
,
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
chapter
clearly
have
a
right
to
settle
what
sum
should
be
pay
.
<EOS>
He
also
declare
that
the
government
have
no
more
right
to
saddle
the
charity
with
twelve
old
woman
than
with
twelve
hundred
;
and
he
be
,
therefore
,
very
indignant
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
probably
forget
when
so
talk
that
government
have
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
and
have
never
assume
any
such
might
or
any
such
right
.
<EOS>
He
make
the
common
mistake
of
attribute
to
the
government
,
which
in
such
matter
be
powerless
,
the
doing
of
Parliament
,
which
in
such
matter
be
omnipotent
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
feel
that
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
situation
of
warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
be
indeed
curtail
by
the
new
arrangement
;
that
the
whole
establishment
have
to
a
certain
degree
be
make
vile
by
the
touch
of
Whig
commissioner
;
that
the
place
,
with
its
lessened
income
,
its
old
woman
,
and
other
innovation
,
be
very
different
from
the
hospital
of
former
day
;
still
the
archdeacon
be
too
practical
a
man
of
the
world
to
wish
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
who
have
at
present
little
more
than
£
200
per
annum
for
all
his
want
,
should
refuse
the
situation
,
defile
,
undignified
,
and
commission
-
ride
as
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
,
accordingly
,
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
return
to
his
old
home
at
the
hospital
,
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
have
experience
almost
a
childish
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
diminished
income
be
to
him
not
even
the
source
of
momentary
regret
.
<EOS>
the
matron
and
the
old
woman
do
rather
go
against
the
grain
,
but
he
be
able
to
console
himself
with
the
reflection
that
,
after
all
,
such
an
arrangement
may
be
of
real
service
to
the
poor
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
he
must
receive
his
reappointment
as
the
gift
of
the
new
bishop
,
and
probably
through
the
hand
of
Mr.
Slope
,
annoy
him
a
little
,
but
his
mind
be
set
at
rest
by
the
assurance
of
the
archdeacon
that
there
would
be
no
favour
in
such
a
presentation
.
<EOS>
the
reappointment
of
the
old
warden
would
be
regard
by
all
the
world
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
therefore
,
feel
no
hesitation
in
tell
his
daughter
that
they
may
look
upon
his
return
to
his
old
quarter
as
a
settled
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
not
have
to
ask
for
it
,
Papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
ground
on
which
I
could
ask
for
any
favour
from
the
bishop
,
whom
,
indeed
,
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
nor
would
I
ask
a
favour
,
the
granting
of
which
may
possibly
be
make
a
question
to
be
settle
by
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
he
,
move
for
a
moment
by
a
spirit
very
unlike
his
own
,
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
;
but
I
should
never
go
there
if
it
be
necessary
that
my
do
so
should
be
the
subject
of
a
request
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
little
outbreak
of
her
father
's
anger
jar
on
the
present
tone
of
Eleanor
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
learn
to
like
Mr.
Slope
,
but
she
have
learn
to
think
that
he
have
much
respect
for
her
father
;
and
she
would
,
therefore
,
willingly
use
her
effort
to
induce
something
like
good
feeling
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
think
you
somewhat
mistake
Mr.
Slope
's
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
?
"
say
he
placidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
do
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
intend
no
personal
disrespect
to
you
when
he
preach
the
sermon
which
make
the
archdeacon
and
the
dean
so
angry
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
suppose
he
do
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
never
inquire
within
myself
whether
he
do
or
no
.
<EOS>
such
a
matter
would
be
unworthy
of
any
inquiry
,
and
very
unworthy
of
the
consideration
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
but
I
fear
he
intend
disrespect
to
the
ministration
of
God
's
service
,
as
conduct
in
conformity
with
the
rule
of
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
may
it
not
be
that
he
think
it
his
duty
to
express
his
dissent
from
that
which
you
,
and
the
dean
,
and
all
of
us
here
so
much
approve
?

the

It

three
month

Dr.
Proudie
begin

change
have
already

in

the
energy

active
mind
.
<EOS>
among
other
thing
absentee
clergyman
have
be
favour
with
hint
much
too
strong
to
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
poor
dear
old
Bishop
<EOS>
Grantly
have
on
this
matter
be
too
lenient
,
and
the
archdeacon
have
never
be
incline
to
be
severe
with
those
who
be
absent
on
reputable
pretence
,
and
who
provide
for
their
duty
in
a
liberal
way
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
great
of
the
diocesan
sinner
in
this
respect
be
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
year
have
now
pass
since
he
have
do
a
day
's
duty
,
and
yet
there
be
no
reason
against
his
do
duty
except
a
want
of
inclination
on
his
own
part
.
<EOS>
He
hold
a
prebendal
stall
in
the
diocese
,
one
of
the
good
residence
in
the
close
,
and
the
two
large
rectory
of
Crabtree
Canonicorum
and
Stogpingum
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
the
cure
of
three
parish
,
for
that
of
Eiderdown
be
join
to
Stogpingum
.
<EOS>
He
have
reside
in
Italy
for
twelve
year
.
<EOS>
His
first
go
there
have
be
attribute
to
a
sore
throat
,
and
that
sore
throat
,
though
never
repeat
in
any
violent
manner
,
have
stand
him
in
such
stead
that
it
have
enable
him
to
live
in
easy
idleness
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
now
be
summon
home
 
not
,
indeed
,
with
rough
violence
,
or
by
any
peremptory
command
,
but
by
a
mandate
which
he
find
himself
unable
to
disregard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
write
to
him
by
the
bishop
's
desire
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
the
bishop
much
want
the
valuable
co
-
operation
of
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
in
the
diocese
;
in
the
next
,
the
bishop
think
it
his
imperative
duty
to
become
personally
acquaint
with
the
most
conspicuous
of
his
diocesan
clergy
;
then
the
bishop
think
it
essentially
necessary
for
Dr.
Stanhope
's
own
interest
that
Dr.
Stanhope
should
,
at
any
rate
for
a
time
,
return
to
Barchester
;
and
lastly
,
it
be
say
that
so
strong
a
feeling
be
at
the
present
moment
evince
by
the
hierarch
of
the
church
with
reference
to
the
absence
of
its
clerical
member
,
that
it
behove
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
not
to
allow
his
name
to
stand
among
those
which
would
probably
in
a
few
month
be
submit
to
the
council
of
the
nation
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
ambiguously
frightful
in
this
last
threat
that
Dr.
Stanhope
determine
to
spend
two
or
three
summer
month
at
his
residence
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
rectory
be
inhabit
by
his
curate
,
and
he
feel
himself
from
disuse
to
be
unfit
for
parochial
duty
;
but
his
prebendal
home
be
keep
empty
for
him
,
and
he
think
it
probable
that
he
may
be
able
now
and
again
to
preach
a
prebendal
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
arrive
,
therefore
,
with
all
his
family
at
Barchester
,
and
he
and
they
must
be
introduce
to
my
reader
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
family
characteristic
of
the
Stanhopes
may
probably
be
say
to
be
heartlessness
,
but
this
want
of
feeling
be
,
in
most
of
them
,
accompany
by
so
great
an
amount
of
good
nature
as
to
make
itself
but
little
noticeable
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
prone
to
oblige
their
neighbour
that
their
neighbour
fail
to
perceive
how
indifferent
to
them
be
the
happiness
and
well
-
being
of
those
around
them
.
<EOS>
the
Stanhopes
would
visit
you
in
your
sickness
(
provide
it
be
not
contagious
)
,
would
bring
you
orange
,
french
novel
,
and
the
last
new
bit
of
scandal
,
and
then
hear
of
your
death
or
your
recovery
with
an
equally
indifferent
composure
.
<EOS>
Their
conduct
to
each
other
be
the
same
as
to
the
world
;
they
bear
and
forbore
;
and
there
be
sometimes
,
as
will
be
see
,
much
necessity
for
forbear
;
but
their
love
among
themselves
rarely
reach
above
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
much
each
of
the
family
be
able
to
do
,
and
how
much
each
do
,
to
prevent
the
well
-
being
of
the
other
four
.
  
<EOS>
for
there
be
five
in
all
;
the
doctor
,
namely
,
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
,
two
daughter
,
and
one
son
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
perhaps
,
be
the
least
singular
and
most
estimable
of
them
all
,
and
yet
such
good
quality
as
he
possess
be
all
negative
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
-
look
rather
plethoric
gentleman
of
about
sixty
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
snow
-
white
,
very
plentiful
,
and
somewhat
like
wool
of
the
fine
description
.
<EOS>
His
whisker
be
very
large
and
very
white
,
and
give
to
his
face
the
appearance
of
a
benevolent
,
sleepy
old
lion
.
<EOS>
His
dress
be
always
unexceptionable
.
<EOS>
although
he
have
live
so
many
year
in
Italy
it
be
invariably
of
a
decent
clerical
hue
,
but
it
never
be
hyperclerical
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
not
give
to
much
talking
,
but
what
little
he
do
say
be
generally
well
say
.
<EOS>
His
reading
seldom
go
beyond
romance
and
poetry
of
the
light
and
not
always
most
moral
description
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
a
_
bon
vivant
_
;
an
accomplished
judge
of
wine
,
though
he
never
drink
to
excess
;
and
a
most
inexorable
critic
in
all
affair
touch
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
much
to
forgive
in
his
own
family
,
since
a
family
have
grow
up
around
him
,
and
have
forgive
everything
 
except
inattention
to
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
His
weakness
in
that
respect
be
now
fully
understand
,
and
his
temper
but
seldom
try
.
<EOS>
as
Dr.
Stanhope
be
a
clergyman
,
it
may
be
suppose
that
his
religious
conviction
make
up
a
considerable
part
of
his
character
,
but
this
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
religious
conviction
must
be
believe
,
but
he
rarely
obtrude
them
,
even
on
his
child
.
<EOS>
this
abstinence
on
his
part
be
not
systematic
,
but
very
characteristic
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
have
predetermine
never
to
influence
their
thought
,
but
he
be
so
habitually
idle
that
his
time
for
do
so
have
never
come
till
the
opportunity
for
do
so
be
go
forever
.
<EOS>
whatever
conviction
the
father
may
have
have
,
the
child
be
at
any
rate
but
indifferent
member
of
the
church
from
which
he
draw
his
income
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Dr.
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
the
feature
of
Mrs.
Stanhope
's
character
be
even
less
plainly
mark
than
those
of
her
lord
.
<EOS>
the
_
far
niente
_
of
her
italian
life
have
enter
into
her
very
soul
,
and
bring
her
to
regard
a
state
of
inactivity
as
the
only
earthly
good
.
<EOS>
in
manner
and
appearance
she
be
exceedingly
prepossess
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
beauty
,
and
even
now
,
at
fifty
-
five
,
she
be
a
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
be
always
perfect
:
<EOS>
she
never
dress
but
once
in
the
day
,
and
never
appear
till
between
three
and
four
;
but
when
she
do
appear
,
she
appear
at
her
good
.
<EOS>
whether
the
toil
rest
partly
with
her
,
or
wholly
with
her
handmaid
,
it
be
not
for
such
a
one
as
the
author
even
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
structure
of
her
attire
be
always
elaborate
and
yet
never
over
-
labour
.
<EOS>
She
be
rich
in
apparel
but
not
bedizen
with
finery
;
her
ornament
be
costly
,
rare
,
and
such
as
could
not
fail
to
attract
notice
,
but
they
do
not
look
as
though
wear
with
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
well
know
the
great
architectural
secret
of
decorate
her
construction
,
and
never
descend
to
construct
a
decoration
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
have
say
that
Mrs.
Stanhope
know
how
to
dress
and
use
her
knowledge
daily
,
we
have
say
all
.
<EOS>
other
purpose
in
life
<EOS>
she
have
none
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
,
indeed
,
that
she
do
not
interfere
with
the
purpose
of
other
.
<EOS>
in
early
life
she
have
undergo
great
trial
with
reference
to
the
doctor
's
dinner
,
but
for
the
last
ten
or
twelve
year
her
eld
daughter
Charlotte
have
take
that
labour
off
her
hand
,
and
she
have
have
little
to
trouble
her
 
little
,
that
is
,
till
the
edict
for
this
terrible
english
journey
have
go
forth
:
since
then
,
indeed
,
her
life
have
be
laborious
enough
.
<EOS>
for
such
a
one
,
the
toil
of
be
carry
from
the
shore
of
Como
to
the
city
of
Barchester
be
more
than
labour
enough
,
let
the
care
of
the
carrier
be
ever
so
vigilant
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stanhope
have
be
oblige
to
have
every
one
of
her
dress
take
in
from
the
effect
of
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
be
at
this
time
about
thirty
-
five
year
old
,
and
whatever
may
have
be
her
fault
,
she
have
none
of
those
which
belong
particularly
to
old
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
neither
dress
young
,
nor
talk
young
,
nor
indeed
look
young
.
<EOS>
She
appear
to
be
perfectly
content
with
her
time
of
life
,
and
in
no
way
affect
the
grace
of
youth
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
fine
young
woman
,
and
have
she
be
a
man
,
would
have
be
a
very
fine
young
man
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
do
in
the
house
,
and
that
be
not
do
by
servant
,
be
do
by
her
.
<EOS>
She
give
the
order
,
pay
the
bill
,
hire
and
dismiss
the
domestic
,
make
the
tea
,
carve
the
meat
,
and
manage
everything
in
the
Stanhope
household
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
she
alone
,
could
ever
induce
her
father
to
look
into
the
state
of
his
worldly
concern
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
she
alone
,
could
in
any
degree
control
the
absurdity
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
she
alone
,
prevent
the
whole
family
from
fall
into
utter
disrepute
and
beggary
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
her
advice
that
they
now
find
themselves
very
unpleasantly
situate
in
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
,
the
character
of
Charlotte
Stanhope
be
not
unprepossessing
.
<EOS>
but
it
remain
to
be
say
that
the
influence
which
she
have
in
her
family
,
though
it
have
be
use
to
a
certain
extent
for
their
worldly
well
-
being
,
have
not
be
use
to
their
real
benefit
,
as
it
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
aid
her
father
in
his
indifference
to
his
professional
duty
,
counsel
him
that
his
living
be
as
much
his
individual
property
as
the
estate
of
his
eld
brother
be
the
property
of
that
worthy
peer
.
<EOS>
She
have
for
year
past
stifle
every
little
rise
wish
for
a
return
to
England
which
the
doctor
have
from
time
to
time
express
.
<EOS>
She
have
encourage
her
mother
in
her
idleness
,
in
order
that
she
herself
may
be
mistress
and
manager
of
the
Stanhope
household
.
<EOS>
She
have
encourage
and
foster
the
folly
of
her
sister
,
though
she
be
always
willing
,
and
often
able
,
to
protect
her
from
their
probable
result
.
<EOS>
She
have
do
her
good
,
and
have
thoroughly
succeed
in
spoil
her
brother
,
and
turn
him
loose
upon
the
world
an
idle
man
without
a
profession
and
without
a
shilling
that
he
could
call
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stanhope
be
a
clever
woman
,
able
to
talk
on
most
subject
,
and
quite
indifferent
as
to
what
the
subject
be
.
<EOS>
She
pride
herself
on
her
freedom
from
English
prejudice
,
and
,
she
may
have
add
,
from
feminine
delicacy
.
<EOS>
on
religion
she
be
a
pure
free
-
thinker
,
and
with
much
want
of
true
affection
,
delighted
to
throw
out
her
own
view
before
the
troubled
mind
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
to
have
shake
what
remain
of
his
Church
of
England
faith
would
have
gratify
her
much
,
but
the
idea
of
his
abandon
his
preferment
in
the
church
have
never
once
present
itself
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
indeed
,
when
he
have
no
income
from
any
other
source
?
  
<EOS>
but
the
two
most
prominent
member
of
the
family
still
remain
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
the
second
child
have
be
christen
Madeline
and
have
be
a
great
beauty
.
<EOS>
We
need
not
say
have
be
,
for
she
be
never
more
beautiful
than
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
though
her
person
for
many
year
have
be
disfigure
by
an
accident
.
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
that
we
should
give
in
detail
the
early
history
of
Madeline
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
to
Italy
when
about
seventeen
year
of
age
,
and
have
be
allow
to
make
the
most
of
her
surpass
beauty
in
the
salon
of
Milan
and
among
the
crowded
villas
along
the
shore
of
the
Lake
of
Como
.
<EOS>
She
have
become
famous
for
adventure
in
which
her
character
be
just
not
lose
,
and
have
destroy
the
heart
of
a
dozen
cavalier
without
once
be
touch
in
her
own
.
<EOS>
blood
have
flow
in
quarrel
about
her
charm
,
and
she
have
hear
of
these
encounter
with
pleasurable
excitement
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
tell
of
her
that
on
one
occasion
she
have
stand
by
in
the
disguise
of
a
page
and
have
see
her
lover
fall
.
  
<EOS>
as
be
so
often
the
case
,
she
have
marry
the
very
bad
of
those
who
seek
her
hand
.
<EOS>
why
she
have
choose
Paulo
Neroni
,
a
man
of
no
birth
and
no
property
,
a
mere
captain
in
the
Pope
's
guard
,
one
who
have
come
up
to
Milan
either
simply
as
an
adventurer
or
else
as
a
spy
,
a
man
of
harsh
temper
and
oily
manner
,
<EOS>
mean
in
figure
,
swarthy
in
face
,
and
so
false
in
word
as
to
be
hourly
detect
,
<EOS>
need
not
now
be
tell
.
<EOS>
when
the
moment
for
do
so
come
,
she
have
probably
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
have
become
her
husband
,
and
after
a
prolonged
honeymoon
among
the
lake
,
they
have
go
together
to
Rome
,
the
papal
captain
have
vainly
endeavour
to
induce
his
wife
to
remain
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
six
month
afterwards
she
arrive
at
her
father
's
house
a
cripple
,
and
a
mother
.
<EOS>
She
have
arrive
without
even
notice
,
with
hardly
clothe
to
cover
her
,
and
without
one
of
those
many
ornament
which
have
grace
her
bridal
trousseau
.
<EOS>
Her
baby
be
in
the
arm
of
a
poor
girl
from
Milan
,
whom
she
have
take
in
exchange
for
the
roman
maid
who
have
accompany
her
thus
far
,
and
who
have
then
,
as
her
mistress
say
,
become
homesick
and
have
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
lady
have
determine
that
there
should
be
no
witness
to
tell
story
of
her
life
in
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
fall
,
she
say
,
in
ascend
a
ruin
,
and
have
fatally
injure
the
sinew
of
her
knee
;
so
fatally
that
when
she
stand
,
she
lose
eight
inch
of
her
accustomed
height
;
so
fatally
that
when
she
essay
to
move
,
she
could
only
drag
herself
painfully
along
,
with
protruded
hip
and
extended
foot
,
in
a
manner
less
graceful
than
that
of
a
hunchback
.
<EOS>
She
have
consequently
make
up
her
mind
,
once
and
forever
,
that
she
would
never
stand
and
never
attempt
to
move
herself
.
  
<EOS>
story
be
not
slow
to
follow
her
,
aver
that
she
have
be
cruelly
ill
-
use
by
Neroni
,
and
that
to
his
violence
have
she
owe
her
accident
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
little
have
be
say
about
her
husband
,
but
that
little
have
make
it
clearly
intelligible
to
the
family
that
Signor
Neroni
be
to
be
see
and
hear
of
no
more
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
question
as
to
readmitte
the
poor
,
ill
-
use
beauty
to
her
old
family
right
,
no
question
as
to
adopt
her
infant
daughter
beneath
the
Stanhope
roof
-
tree
.
<EOS>
though
heartless
,
the
stanhope
be
not
selfish
.
<EOS>
the
two
be
take
in
,
pet
,
make
much
of
,
for
a
time
all
but
adore
,
and
then
feel
by
the
two
parent
to
be
great
nuisance
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
house
the
lady
be
,
and
there
she
remain
,
have
her
own
way
,
though
that
way
be
not
very
conformable
with
the
customary
usage
of
an
english
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Neroni
,
though
force
to
give
up
all
motion
in
the
world
,
have
no
intention
whatever
of
give
up
the
world
itself
.
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
her
face
be
uninjured
,
and
that
beauty
be
of
a
peculiar
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
copious
rich
brown
hair
be
wear
in
grecian
bandeaux
<EOS>
round
her
head
,
display
as
much
as
possible
of
her
forehead
and
cheek
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
,
though
rather
low
,
be
very
beautiful
from
its
perfect
contour
and
pearly
whiteness
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
long
and
large
,
and
marvellously
bright
;
may
I
venture
to
say
bright
as
Lucifer
's
,
I
should
perhaps
best
express
the
depth
of
their
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
They
be
dreadful
eye
to
look
at
,
such
as
would
absolutely
deter
any
man
of
quiet
mind
and
easy
spirit
from
attempt
a
passage
of
arm
with
such
foe
.
<EOS>
there
be
talent
in
them
,
and
the
fire
of
passion
and
the
play
of
wit
,
but
there
be
no
love
.
<EOS>
Cruelty
be
there
instead
,
and
courage
,
a
desire
of
masterhood
,
cunne
,
and
a
wish
for
mischief
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
eye
,
they
be
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
the
eyelash
be
long
and
perfect
,
and
the
long
,
steady
,
unabashed
gaze
with
which
she
would
look
into
the
face
of
her
admirer
fascinate
while
it
frighten
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
basilisk
from
whom
an
ardent
lover
of
beauty
could
make
no
escape
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
and
mouth
and
tooth
and
chin
and
neck
and
bust
be
perfect
,
much
more
so
at
twenty
-
eight
than
they
have
be
at
eighteen
.
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
with
such
charm
still
glow
in
her
face
,
and
with
such
deformity
destroy
her
figure
,
she
should
resolve
to
be
see
,
but
only
to
be
see
recline
on
a
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
Her
resolve
have
not
be
carry
out
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
have
still
frequent
the
opera
at
Milan
;
she
have
still
be
see
occasionally
in
the
salon
of
the
noblesse
;
she
have
cause
herself
to
be
carry
in
and
out
from
her
carriage
,
and
that
in
such
a
manner
as
in
no
wise
to
disturb
her
charm
,
disarrange
her
dress
,
or
expose
her
deformity
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
always
accompany
her
and
a
maid
,
a
manservant
also
,
and
on
state
occasion
,
two
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
her
purpose
could
have
be
achieve
with
less
;
and
yet
,
poor
as
she
be
,
she
have
achieve
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
and
then
again
the
more
dissolute
italian
youth
of
Milan
frequent
the
Stanhope
villa
and
surround
her
couch
,
not
greatly
to
her
father
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
sometimes
his
spirit
would
rise
,
a
dark
spot
would
show
itself
on
his
cheek
,
and
he
would
rebel
,
but
Charlotte
would
assuage
him
with
some
peculiar
triumph
of
her
culinary
art
and
all
again
would
be
smooth
for
awhile
.
  
<EOS>
Madeline
affect
all
manner
of
rich
and
quaint
device
in
the
garniture
of
her
room
,
her
person
,
and
her
feminine
belonging
.
<EOS>
in
nothing
be
this
more
apparent
than
in
the
visit
card
which
she
have
prepare
for
her
use
.
<EOS>
for
such
an
article
one
would
say
that
she
,
in
her
present
state
,
could
have
but
small
need
,
see
how
improbable
it
be
that
she
should
make
a
morning
call
:
but
not
such
be
her
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
card
be
surround
by
a
deep
border
of
gilding
;
on
this
she
have
imprint
,
in
three
line
  
La
Signora
Madeline
Vesey
Neroni
.
 
<EOS>
Nata
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
and
over
the
name
she
have
a
bright
gilt
coronet
,
which
certainly
look
very
magnificent
.
<EOS>
how
she
have
come
to
concoct
such
a
name
for
herself
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
be
christen
Vesey
as
another
man
be
christen
Thomas
,
and
she
have
no
more
right
to
assume
it
than
would
have
the
daughter
of
a
Mr.
Josiah
Jones
to
call
herself
Mrs.
Josiah
Smith
,
on
marry
a
man
of
the
latter
name
.
<EOS>
the
gold
coronet
be
equally
out
of
place
,
and
perhaps
insert
with
even
less
excuse
.
<EOS>
Paulo
Neroni
have
have
not
the
faint
title
to
call
himself
a
scion
of
even
italian
nobility
.
<EOS>
have
the
pair
meet
in
England
<EOS>
Neroni
would
probably
have
be
a
count
,
but
they
have
meet
in
Italy
,
and
any
such
pretence
on
his
part
would
have
be
simply
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
a
coronet
,
however
,
be
a
pretty
ornament
,
and
if
it
could
solace
a
poor
cripple
to
have
such
on
her
card
,
who
would
begrudge
it
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
of
her
husband
,
or
of
his
individual
family
,
she
never
speak
,
but
with
her
admirer
she
would
often
allude
in
a
mysterious
way
to
her
married
life
and
isolate
state
,
and
,
point
to
her
daughter
,
would
call
her
the
last
of
the
blood
of
the
emperor
,
thus
refer
Neroni
's
extraction
to
the
old
roman
family
from
which
the
bad
of
the
Caesars
spring
.
  
<EOS>
the
"
signora
"
be
not
without
talent
and
not
without
a
certain
sort
of
industry
;
she
be
an
indomitable
letter
-
writer
,
and
her
letter
be
worth
the
postage
:
they
be
full
of
wit
,
mischief
,
satire
,
love
,
latitudinarian
philosophy
,
free
religion
,
and
,
sometimes
,
alas
,
loose
ribaldry
.
<EOS>
the
subject
,
however
,
depend
entirely
on
the
recipient
,
and
she
be
prepared
to
correspond
with
anyone
but
moral
young
lady
or
stiff
old
woman
.
<EOS>
She
write
also
a
kind
of
poetry
,
generally
in
Italian
,
and
short
romance
,
generally
in
French
.
<EOS>
She
read
much
of
a
desultory
sort
of
literature
,
and
as
a
modern
linguist
have
really
make
great
proficiency
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
lady
who
have
now
come
to
wound
the
heart
of
the
man
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Ethelbert
Stanhope
be
in
some
respect
like
his
young
sister
,
but
he
be
less
inestimable
as
a
man
than
she
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
His
great
fault
be
an
entire
absence
of
that
principle
which
should
have
induce
him
,
as
the
son
of
a
man
without
fortune
,
to
earn
his
own
bread
.
<EOS>
many
attempt
have
be
make
to
get
him
to
do
so
,
but
these
have
all
be
frustrate
,
not
so
much
by
idleness
on
his
part
as
by
a
disinclination
to
exert
himself
in
any
way
not
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
educate
at
Eton
and
have
be
intend
for
the
Church
,
but
he
have
leave
Cambridge
in
disgust
after
a
single
term
,
and
notify
to
his
father
his
intention
to
study
for
the
bar
.
<EOS>
preparatory
to
that
,
he
think
it
well
that
he
should
attend
a
german
university
,
and
consequently
go
to
Leipzig
.
<EOS>
there
he
remain
two
year
and
bring
away
a
knowledge
of
german
and
a
taste
for
the
fine
art
.
<EOS>
He
still
,
however
,
intend
himself
for
the
bar
,
take
chamber
,
engage
himself
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
a
learn
pundit
,
and
spend
a
season
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
there
find
that
all
his
aptitude
incline
him
to
the
life
of
an
artist
,
and
he
determine
to
live
by
paint
.
<EOS>
with
this
object
he
return
to
Milan
,
and
have
himself
rig
out
for
Rome
.
<EOS>
as
a
painter
he
may
have
earn
his
bread
,
for
he
want
only
diligence
to
excel
,
but
when
at
Rome
his
mind
be
carry
away
by
other
thing
:
he
soon
write
home
for
money
,
say
that
he
have
be
convert
to
the
Mother
Church
,
that
he
be
already
an
acolyte
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
that
he
be
about
to
start
with
other
to
Palestine
on
a
mission
for
convert
Jews
.
<EOS>
He
do
go
to
Judea
,
but
be
unable
to
convert
the
Jews
,
be
convert
by
them
.
<EOS>
He
again
write
home
,
to
say
that
Moses
be
the
only
giver
of
perfect
law
to
the
world
,
that
the
coming
of
the
true
Messiah
be
at
hand
,
that
great
thing
be
do
in
Palestine
,
and
that
he
have
meet
one
of
the
family
of
Sidonia
,
a
most
remarkable
man
,
who
be
now
on
his
way
to
western
Europe
,
and
whom
he
have
induce
to
deviate
from
his
route
with
the
object
of
call
at
the
Stanhope
villa
.
<EOS>
Ethelbert
then
express
his
hope
that
his
mother
and
sister
would
listen
to
this
wonderful
prophet
.
<EOS>
His
father
he
know
could
not
do
so
from
pecuniary
consideration
.
<EOS>
this
Sidonia
,
however
,
do
not
take
so
strong
a
fancy
to
him
as
another
of
that
family
once
do
to
a
young
english
nobleman
.
<EOS>
at
least
he
provide
him
with
no
heap
of
gold
as
large
as
lion
,
so
that
the
Judaized
Ethelbert
be
again
oblige
to
draw
on
the
revenue
of
the
Christian
Church
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
tell
how
the
father
swear
that
he
would
send
no
more
money
and
receive
no
Jew
,
nor
how
Charlotte
declare
that
Ethelbert
could
not
be
leave
penniless
in
Jerusalem
,
and
how
"
La
Signora
Neroni
"
resolve
to
have
Sidonia
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
the
money
be
send
,
and
the
Jew
do
come
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
do
come
,
but
he
be
not
at
all
to
the
taste
of
"
La
Signora
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
dirty
little
old
man
,
and
though
he
have
provide
no
golden
lion
<EOS>
,
he
have
,
it
seem
,
relieve
young
Stanhope
's
necessity
.
<EOS>
He
positively
refuse
to
leave
the
villa
till
he
have
get
a
bill
from
the
doctor
on
his
London
banker
.
  
<EOS>
Ethelbert
do
not
long
remain
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
He
soon
reappear
at
the
villa
without
prejudice
on
the
subject
of
his
religion
,
and
with
a
firm
resolve
to
achieve
fame
and
fortune
as
a
sculptor
.
<EOS>
He
bring
with
him
some
model
which
he
have
originate
at
Rome
and
which
really
give
such
fair
promise
that
his
father
be
induce
to
go
to
further
expense
in
further
these
view
.
<EOS>
Ethelbert
open
an
establishment
,
or
rather
take
lodging
and
a
workshop
,
at
Carrara
,
and
there
spoilt
much
marble
and
make
some
few
pretty
image
.
<EOS>
since
that
period
,
now
four
year
ago
,
he
have
alternate
between
Carrara
and
the
villa
,
but
his
sojourn
at
the
workshop
become
short
and
short
and
those
at
the
villa
longer
and
longer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
no
wonder
,
for
Carrara
be
not
a
spot
in
which
an
Englishman
would
like
to
dwell
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
family
start
for
England
,
he
have
resolve
not
to
be
leave
behind
,
and
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
eld
sister
,
have
carry
his
point
against
his
father
's
wish
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
,
he
say
,
that
he
should
come
to
England
for
order
.
<EOS>
how
otherwise
be
he
to
bring
his
profession
to
account
?
  
<EOS>
in
personal
appearance
Ethelbert
Stanhope
be
the
most
singular
of
being

<EOS>
He
be
certainly
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
sister
Madeline
's
eye
,
without
their
stare
and
without
their
hard
,
cunning
,
cruel
firmness
.
<EOS>
They
be
also
very
much
light
,
and
of
so
light
and
clear
a
blue
as
to
make
his
face
remarkable
,
if
nothing
else
do
so
.
<EOS>
on
enter
a
room
with
him
,
Ethelbert
's
blue
eye
would
be
the
first
thing
you
would
see
,
and
on
leave
it
almost
the
last
you
would
forget
.
<EOS>
His
light
hair
be
very
long
and
silky
,
come
down
over
his
coat
.
<EOS>
His
beard
have
be
prepare
in
holy
land
,
and
be
patriarchal
.
<EOS>
He
never
shave
and
rarely
trim
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
glossy
,
soft
,
clean
,
and
altogether
not
unprepossesse
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
that
lady
may
desire
to
reel
it
off
and
work
it
into
their
pattern
in
lieu
of
floss
silk
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
fair
and
almost
pink
;
he
be
small
in
height
and
slender
in
limb
,
but
well
-
make
;
and
his
voice
be
of
peculiar
sweetness
.
  
<EOS>
in
manner
and
dress
he
be
equally
remarkable
.
<EOS>
He
have
none
of
the
_
mauvaise
honte
_
of
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
He
require
no
introduction
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
any
person
.
<EOS>
He
habitually
address
stranger
,
lady
as
well
as
man
,
without
any
such
formality
,
and
in
do
so
never
seem
to
meet
with
rebuke
.
<EOS>
His
costume
can
not
be
describe
because
it
be
so
various
,
but
it
be
always
totally
opposed
in
every
principle
of
colour
and
construction
to
the
dress
of
those
with
whom
he
for
the
time
consort
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
habitually
addict
to
make
love
to
lady
,
and
do
so
without
any
scruple
of
conscience
,
or
any
idea
that
such
a
practice
be
amiss
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
heart
to
touch
himself
,
and
be
literally
unaware
that
humanity
be
subject
to
such
an
infliction
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
think
much
about
it
,
but
,
have
he
be
ask
,
would
have
say
that
ill
-
treat
a
lady
's
heart
mean
injure
her
promotion
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
principle
therefore
forbid
him
to
pay
attention
to
a
girl
if
he
think
any
man
be
present
whom
it
may
suit
her
to
marry
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
his
good
nature
frequently
interfere
with
his
amusement
,
but
he
have
no
other
motive
in
abstain
from
the
full
declaration
of
love
to
every
girl
that
please
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
,
as
he
be
generally
call
,
be
,
however
,
popular
with
both
sex
 
and
with
Italians
as
well
as
English
.
<EOS>
His
circle
of
acquaintance
be
very
large
and
embrace
people
of
all
sort
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
respect
for
rank
,
and
no
aversion
to
those
below
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
live
on
familiar
term
with
english
peer
,
german
shopkeeper
,
and
roman
priest
.
<EOS>
all
people
be
nearly
alike
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
above
,
or
rather
below
,
all
prejudice
.
<EOS>
no
virtue
could
charm
him
,
no
vice
shock
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
about
him
a
natural
good
manner
,
which
seem
to
qualify
him
for
the
high
circle
,
and
yet
he
be
never
out
of
place
in
the
low
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
principle
,
no
regard
for
other
,
no
self
-
respect
,
no
desire
to
be
other
than
a
drone
in
the
hive
,
if
only
he
could
,
as
a
drone
,
get
what
honey
be
sufficient
for
him
.
<EOS>
of
honey
,
in
his
latter
day
,
it
may
probably
be
presage
,
that
he
will
have
but
short
allowance
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
family
of
the
Stanhopes
,
who
,
at
this
period
,
suddenly
join
themselves
to
the
ecclesiastical
circle
of
Barchester
close
.
<EOS>
any
stranger
union
it
would
be
impossible
perhaps
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
as
though
they
all
fall
down
into
the
cathedral
precinct
hitherto
unknown
and
untalke
of
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
,
no
amalgamation
would
have
be
at
all
probable
between
the
new
-
comer
and
either
the
Proudie
set
or
the
Grantly
set
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
far
from
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
Stanhopes
be
all
know
by
name
in
Barchester
,
and
Barchester
be
prepared
to
receive
them
with
open
arm
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
one
of
her
prebendary
,
one
of
her
rector
,
one
of
her
pillar
of
strength
;
and
be
,
moreover
,
count
on
as
a
sure
ally
both
by
Proudies
and
Grantlys
.
  
<EOS>
He
himself
be
the
brother
of
one
peer
,
and
his
wife
be
the
sister
of
another
 
and
both
these
peer
be
lord
of
whiggish
tendency
,
with
whom
the
new
bishop
have
some
sort
of
alliance
.
<EOS>
this
be
sufficient
to
give
to
Mr.
Slope
high
hope
that
he
may
enlist
Dr.
Stanhope
on
his
side
,
before
his
enemy
could
outmanoeuvre
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
old
dean
have
many
many
year
ago
,
in
the
day
of
the
doctor
's
clerical
energy
,
be
instrumental
in
assist
him
in
his
view
as
to
preferment
;
and
many
many
year
ago
also
,
the
two
doctor
,
Stanhope
and
Grantly
,
have
,
as
young
parson
,
be
joyous
together
in
the
common
-
room
of
Oxford
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
consequently
,
do
not
doubt
but
that
the
newcomer
would
range
himself
under
his
banner
.
  
<EOS>
little
do
any
of
them
dream
of
what
ingredient
the
Stanhope
family
be
now
compose
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
reception
 
commence
 
<EOS>
the
bishop
and
his
wife
have
spend
only
three
or
four
day
in
Barchester
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
visit
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
,
as
we
have
see
,
take
his
seat
on
his
throne
,
but
his
demeanour
there
,
into
which
it
have
be
his
intention
to
infuse
much
hierarchal
dignity
,
have
be
a
good
deal
disarrange
by
the
audacity
of
his
chaplain
's
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
dare
to
look
his
clergy
in
the
face
,
and
to
declare
by
the
severity
of
his
countenance
that
in
truth
he
mean
all
that
his
factotum
be
say
on
his
behalf
;
nor
yet
do
he
dare
to
throw
Mr.
Slope
over
,
and
show
to
those
around
him
that
he
be
no
party
to
the
sermon
,
and
would
resent
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
accordingly
bless
his
people
in
a
shambling
manner
,
not
at
all
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
and
have
walk
back
to
his
palace
with
his
mind
very
doubtful
as
to
what
he
would
say
to
his
chaplain
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
remain
long
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
doff
his
lawn
when
the
partner
of
all
his
toil
enter
his
study
and
exclaim
even
before
she
have
seat
herself
<EOS>
:
  
"
Bishop
,
do
you
ever
hear
a
more
sublime
,
more
spirit
-
move
,
more
appropriate
discourse
than
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
love
;
ha
 
hum
 
he
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bishop
do
not
know
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
my
lord
,
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
disapprove
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
look
about
the
lady
's
eye
which
do
not
admit
of
my
lord
's
disapprove
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
if
he
intend
to
disapprove
,
it
must
be
now
or
never
;
but
he
also
feel
that
it
could
not
be
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
him
to
say
to
the
wife
of
his
bosom
that
Mr.
Slope
's
sermon
be
ill
-
time
,
impertinent
,
and
vexatious
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
reply
the
bishop
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
not
say
I
disapprove
 
a
very
clever
sermon
and
very
well
intended
,
and
I
dare
say
will
do
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
this
last
praise
be
add
,
see
that
what
he
have
already
say
by
no
mean
satisfied
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
it
be
well
deserved
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
in
your
life
,
bishop
,
hear
anything
so
like
play
-
acting
as
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Harding
sing
the
litany
?
<EOS>
I
shall
beg
Mr.
Slope
to
continue
a
course
of
sermon
on
the
subject
till
all
that
be
alter
.
<EOS>
We
will
have
at
any
rate
,
in
our
cathedral
,
a
decent
,
godly
,
modest
morning
service
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
no
more
play
-
acting
here
now
;
"
and
so
the
lady
ring
for
lunch
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
know
more
about
cathedral
and
dean
and
precentor
and
church
service
than
his
wife
do
,
and
also
more
of
a
bishop
's
power
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
it
better
at
present
to
let
the
subject
drop
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
we
must
go
back
to
London
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
I
find
my
staying
here
will
be
very
inconvenient
to
the
Government
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
know
that
to
this
proposal
his
wife
would
not
object
,
and
he
also
feel
that
by
thus
retreat
from
the
ground
of
battle
the
heat
of
the
fight
may
be
get
over
in
his
absence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
will
remain
here
,
of
course
?
"
say
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
of
course
,
"
say
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
after
less
than
a
week
's
sojourn
in
his
palace
,
do
the
bishop
fly
from
Barchester
;
nor
do
he
return
to
it
for
two
month
,
the
London
season
be
then
over
.
<EOS>
during
that
time
Mr.
Slope
be
not
idle
,
but
he
do
not
again
essay
to
preach
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
Mrs.
Proudie
's
letter
advise
a
course
of
sermon
,
he
have
plead
that
he
would
at
any
rate
wish
to
put
off
such
an
undertaking
till
she
be
there
to
hear
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
employ
his
time
in
consolidate
a
Proudie
and
Slope
party
 
or
rather
a
Slope
and
Proudie
party
,
and
he
have
not
employ
his
time
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
meddle
with
the
dean
and
chapter
,
except
by
give
them
little
teasing
intimation
of
the
bishop
's
wish
about
this
and
the
bishop
's
feeling
about
that
,
in
a
manner
which
be
to
them
sufficiently
annoying
,
but
which
they
could
not
resent
.
<EOS>
He
preach
once
or
twice
in
a
distant
church
in
the
suburb
of
the
city
,
but
make
no
allusion
to
the
cathedral
service
.
<EOS>
He
commence
the
establishment
of
two
"
Bishop
's
Barchester
Sabbath
-
day
school
,
"
give
notice
of
a
propose
"
Bishop
's
Barchester
Young
Men
's
Sabbath
Evening
Lecture
Room

"
and
write
three
or
four
letter
to
the
manager
of
the
Barchester
branch
railway
,
inform
him
how
anxious
the
bishop
be
that
the
Sunday
train
should
be
discontinue
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
two
month
,
however
,
the
bishop
and
the
lady
reappear
,
and
as
a
happy
harbinger
of
their
return
,
herald
their
advent
by
the
promise
of
an
evening
party
on
the
large
scale
.
<EOS>
the
ticket
of
invitation
be
send
out
from
London
 
<EOS>
they
be
date
from
Bruton
Street
,
and
be
dispatch
by
the
odious
Sabbath
-
break
railway
,
in
a
huge
brown
paper
parcel
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
everybody
call
himself
a
gentleman
,
or
herself
a
lady
,
within
the
city
of
Barchester
,
and
a
circle
of
two
mile
round
it
,
be
include
.
<EOS>
ticket
be
send
to
all
the
diocesan
clergy
,
and
also
to
many
other
person
of
priestly
note
,
of
whose
absence
the
bishop
,
or
at
least
the
bishop
's
wife
,
feel
tolerably
confident
.
<EOS>
It
be
intend
,
however
,
to
be
a
thronged
and
noticeable
affair
,
and
preparation
be
make
for
receive
some
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
there
arise
considerable
agitation
among
the
Grantlyites
<EOS>
whether
or
no
they
would
attend
the
episcopal
bidding
.
<EOS>
the
first
feeling
with
them
all
be
to
send
the
brief
excuse
both
for
themselves
and
their
wife
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
by
degree
policy
prevail
over
passion
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
perceive
that
he
would
be
make
a
false
step
if
he
allow
the
cathedral
clergy
to
give
the
bishop
just
ground
of
umbrage
.
<EOS>
They
all
meet
in
conclave
and
agree
to
go
.
<EOS>
They
would
show
that
they
be
willing
to
respect
the
office
,
much
as
they
may
dislike
the
man
.
<EOS>
They
agree
to
go
.
<EOS>
the
old
dean
would
crawl
in
,
if
it
be
but
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
the
chancellor
,
treasurer
,
archdeacon
,
prebendary
,
and
minor
canon
would
all
go
,
and
would
all
take
their
wife
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
especially
bidden
to
do
so
,
resolve
in
his
heart
to
keep
himself
far
remove
from
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Bold
be
determined
to
go
,
though
assure
by
her
father
that
there
be
no
necessity
for
such
a
sacrifice
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
when
all
Barchester
be
to
be
there
,
neither
Eleanor
nor
Mary
Bold
understand
why
they
should
stay
away
.
<EOS>
have
they
not
be
invite
separately
?
<EOS>
and
have
not
a
separate
little
note
from
the
chaplain
,
couch
in
the
most
respectful
language
,
be
enclose
with
the
huge
episcopal
card
?
  
<EOS>
and
the
stanhope
would
be
there
,
one
and
all
.
<EOS>
even
the
lethargic
mother
would
so
far
bestir
herself
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
have
only
just
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
card
be
at
the
residence
wait
for
them
.
<EOS>
no
one
in
Barchester
have
see
them
.
<EOS>
what
well
opportunity
could
they
have
of
show
themselves
to
the
Barchester
world
?
<EOS>
some
few
old
friend
,
such
as
the
archdeacon
and
his
wife
,
have
call
and
have
find
the
doctor
and
his
eld
daughter
,
but
the
_
élite
_
of
the
family
be
not
yet
know
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
indeed
wish
in
his
heart
to
prevent
the
signora
from
accept
the
bishop
's
invitation
,
but
she
herself
have
fully
determine
that
she
would
accept
it
.
<EOS>
if
her
father
be
ashamed
of
have
his
daughter
carry
into
a
bishop
's
palace
,
she
have
no
such
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
shall
,
"
she
have
say
to
her
sister
who
have
gently
endeavour
to
dissuade
her
,
by
say
that
the
company
would
consist
wholly
of
parson
and
parson
"
wife
.
<EOS>
"
parson
,
I
suppose
,
be
much
the
same
as
other
man
,
if
you
strip
them
of
their
black
coat
;
and
as
to
their
wife
,
I
dare
say
they
will
not
trouble
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
Papa
<EOS>
I
do
not
at
all
mean
to
be
leave
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Papa
be
tell
,
and
feel
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
yield
.
<EOS>
He
also
feel
that
it
be
useless
for
him
now
to
be
ashamed
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
such
as
they
be
,
they
have
become
such
under
his
auspex
;
as
he
have
make
his
bed
,
so
he
must
lie
upon
it
;
as
he
have
sow
his
seed
,
so
must
he
reap
his
corn
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
indeed
utter
such
reflexion
in
such
language
,
but
such
be
the
gist
of
his
thought
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
because
Madeline
be
a
cripple
that
he
shrink
from
see
her
make
one
of
the
bishop
's
guest
,
but
because
he
know
that
she
would
practise
her
accustomed
lur
,
and
behave
herself
in
a
way
that
could
not
fail
of
be
distasteful
to
the
propriety
of
Englishwomen
.
<EOS>
these
thing
have
annoy
but
not
shock
him
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
there
they
have
shock
no
one
;
but
here
in
Barchester
,
here
among
his
fellow
parson
,
he
be
ashamed
that
they
should
be
see
.
<EOS>
such
have
be
his
feeling
,
but
he
repress
them
.
<EOS>
what
if
his
brother
clergyman
be
shocked
!
<EOS>
They
could
not
take
from
him
his
preferment
because
the
manner
of
his
married
daughter
be
too
free
.
  
<EOS>
La
Signora
Neroni
have
,
at
any
rate
,
<EOS>
no
fear
that
she
would
shock
anybody
.
<EOS>
Her
ambition
be
to
create
a
sensation
,
to
have
parson
at
her
foot
,
see
that
the
manhood
of
Barchester
consist
mainly
of
parson
,
and
to
send
,
if
possible
,
every
parson
's
wife
home
with
a
green
fit
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
none
could
be
too
old
for
her
,
and
hardly
any
too
young
.
<EOS>
none
too
sanctify
,
and
none
too
worldly
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
prepared
to
entrap
the
bishop
himself
,
and
then
to
turn
up
her
nose
at
the
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
doubt
of
success
,
for
she
have
always
succeed
;
but
one
thing
be
absolutely
necessary
;
she
must
secure
the
entire
use
of
a
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
the
card

Dr.
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
and

the
palace
and
that
the
chaplain

<EOS>
It
be
much
more
in
her
line
to
apply
to
him
than
to
the
lady
,
and
she
accordingly
write
him
the
pretty
little
billet
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
five
line

everything

They

<EOS>
It

wonderful
<EOS>
what
good
English

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
"
no
 
not

say
the

a
heavy
rector

You

<EOS>
"
ah
 
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
translation
be
occasionally

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They

cut
them
all
down
to
pretty
nearly
the

<EOS>
to
this
the
bishop
could
not
bring
himself
to
make
any
answer
,
but
again
attempt

<EOS>
"
but
the
work

,
be
different
?
"
continue
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
be
there
much
to
do
here
,
at
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
exactly
in
the
tone
that
a
young
Admiralty
clerk
may
use
in
ask
the
same
question
of
a
brother
acolyte
at
the
Treasury
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
work
of
a
bishop
of
the
Church
of
England
,
"
say
Dr.
Proudie
with
considerable
dignity
,
"
be
not
easy
.
<EOS>
the
responsibility
which
he
have
to
bear
be
very
great
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
?
"
say
Bertie

open
wide
his
wonderful
blue
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
never
be
afraid
of
responsibility
.
<EOS>
I
once
have
thought
of
be
a
bishop
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
thought
of
be
a
bishop
!
"
say
Dr.
Proudie
,
much
amazed
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
a
parson
 
a
parson
first
,
you
know
,
and
a
bishop
afterwards
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
once
begin
,
I
would
have
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
whole
,
I
like
the
Church
of
Rome
the
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
could
not
discuss
the
point
,
so
he
remain
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
there
be
my
father
,
"
continue
Bertie
;
"
he
have
not
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
he
do
not
like
say
the
same
thing
over
so
often

<EOS>
by
the
by

Bishop

my
father

"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
more
amazed
than

see
his
father

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
he
reply
;
he
have
not
yet
have
the
pleasure
:
he
hope
he
may
;
and
,
as
he
say
so
,
he
resolve
to
bear
heavy
on
that
fat
,
immovable
rector
,
if
ever
he
have
the
power
of
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
the
room
somewhere
,
"
say
Bertie
,
"
and
he
will
turn
up
soon
.
<EOS>
by
the
by
,
do
you
know
much
about
the
Jews
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
bishop
see
a
way
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
I
be
force
to
go
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
I
believe
I
will
follow
in
your
wake

say
Bertie

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
terribly
hot

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
he
address
to
the
fat
rector
with
whom
he
have
bring
himself
into
the
close
contact
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
get
this
sofa
into
the
bad
possible
part
of
the
room
;
suppose
we
move
it
.
<EOS>
take
care
,
Madeline
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
sofa
have
certainly
be
so
place
that
those
who
be
behind
it
find
great
difficulty
in
get
out
;
there
be
but
a
narrow
gangway
,
which
one
person
could
stop
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
bad
arrangement
,
and
one
which
Bertie
think
it
may
be
well
to
improve
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
,
Madeline
,
"
say
he
,
and
turn
to
the
fat
rector
,
add
,
"
just
help
me
with
a
slight
push

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
rector

weight
be
rest
on
the
sofa
and
unwittingly
lend
all
its
impetus
to
accelerate
and
increase
the
motion
which
Bertie
intentionally
originate
.
<EOS>
the
sofa
rush
from
its
mooring
and
run
half

way
into
the
middle
of
the
room

<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
be
stand
with
Mr.
Slope
in
front
of
the
signora
,
and
have
be
try
to
be
condescend
and
sociable
;
but
she
be
not
in
the
very
good
of
temper
,
for
she
find
that
,
whenever
she
speak
to
the
lady

the
lady
reply
by
speak
to
Mr.
Slope

<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
a
favourite

no
doubt

but
Mrs.
Proudie
have
no
idea
of
be
less
thought
of
than
the
chaplain

<EOS>
She
be
begin
to
be
stately

stiff

and
offend

when
unfortunately
the
castor

the
sofa

itself
in
her
lace
train

and
carry
away
<EOS>
there
be
no

and
breadth
to
expose
themselves

a
long
ruin
of
rent
lace
disfigure
the
carpet
,
and
still
clung
to
the
vile
wheel
on
which
the
sofa
move
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
when
a
granite
battery
be
raise
,
excellent

the
eye
of
warfare
man

be
its
strength
and
symmetry
admired
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
work
of
year
.
<EOS>
Its
neat
embrasure
,
its
finished
parapet
,
its
casemated
story
show
all
the
skill
of
modern
science

<EOS>
but

anon

a
small
spark

the
treacherous
fusee
 
<EOS>
a
cloud

to
the

<EOS>
and
then
nothing
be
to

see
but
dirt

dust
and
ugly
fragment

<EOS>
We
know
what
be
the
wrath

<EOS>
We
know
to

storm
of
passion

mind
can
yield

<EOS>
as
Juno
may
have
look
at
Paris

Mount
Ida

so
do
Mrs.
Proudie
look
on
Ethelbert
Stanhope
when
he
push
the
leg

the
sofa
into
her
lace
train

<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
"
Idiot

re

echo
Mrs.
Proudie

as
though
the
word
be
not
half
strong
enough
to
express
the
require
meaning
;
"
I
will
let
him
know
 
"
and
then
look
round
to
learn

at
a
glance

the
bad
,
she
see
that
at
present
it
behove
her
to
collect
the

<EOS>
Bertie

when
he
see
what
he
have
do

rush
over
the
sofa
and
throw
himself
on
one
knee
before
the
offend
lady
.
<EOS>
His
object
,
doubtless
,
be
to
liberate
the
tear
lace
from
the
castor

but
he
look
as
though
he
be
implore
pardon
from
a
goddess
.
  
<EOS>
"
unhand
it
,
sir
!
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
from
what
scrap
of
dramatic
poetry
she
have
extract
the
word
can
not
be
say
,
but
it
must
have
rest
on
her
memory
,
and
now
seem
opportunely
dignified
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
fly
to
the
loom
of
the
fairy
to
repair
the
damage
,
if
you
will
only
forgive
me

Ethelbert

still
on
his
knee

<EOS>
"
unhand
it

say
Mrs.
Proudie
with
redouble
emphasis
,
and
all

furious
wrath

<EOS>
this
allusion
to
the
fairy
be
a
direct
mockery
and
intend
to
turn
her
into
ridicule

<EOS>
so
at

it
seem
to
her

"
<EOS>
unhand

up
both

<EOS>
Hereupon
the
Signora
laugh
;
not
loud

indeed

but
yet
audibly

<EOS>
and
as
the
tigress
bereft
of
her

turn
with
equal
anger

do
Mrs.

turn
upon
her
female
guest

<EOS>
"
Madam

<EOS>
she

it
be

to

of
the

flash
from
her

<EOS>
the
signora
stare

you

preferment

I
bear
it

"
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
there
be
a
laugh
against
the
fat
rector
,
in
which
both
the
bishop
and
the
chaplain
join
,
and
thus
thing
get
themselves
again
into
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
lord
,
I
be
so
sorry
for
this
accident
,
"
say
the
signora
,
put
out
her
hand
so
as
to
force
the
bishop
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
My
brother
be
so
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
pray
sit
down
,
and
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
make
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
so
poor
a
creature
as
to
want
a
sofa
,
I
be
not
so
selfish
as
to
require
it
all
.
"
<EOS>
Madeline
could
always
dispose
herself
so
as
to
make
room
for
a
gentleman
,
though
,
as
she
declare
,
the
crinoline
of
her
lady
friend
be
much
too
bulky
to
be
so
accommodate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
meet
you
that
I
have
have
myself
drag
here
,
"
she
continue
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
with
your
occupation

one
can
not
even
hope
that
you
should
have
time
to
come

us
,
that
is
,
in
the
way

<EOS>
and
at
your
english
dinner

party
all
be
so
dull
and
so
stately
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
my
lord

that
in
come
to
England
my
only
consolation
have
be
the
thought
that
I
should
know
you

she
look
at
him
with
the
look
of
a
she

devil

<EOS>
the
bishop
,
however
,
think
that
she
look
very
like
an
angel
and
,
accept
the
proffer
seat
,
sit
down
beside
her

<EOS>
He
utter
some
platitude
as
to
his
deep
obligation
for
the
trouble
she
have
take
,
and
wonder
more
and
more
who
she
be

<EOS>

of
course
you
know
my
sad
story
?
<EOS>
"
she
continue
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
do
not
know
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
however
,
or
think
he
know
,
that
she
could
not
walk
into
a
room
like
other
people
,
and
so
make
the
most
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
put
on
a
look
of
ineffable
distress
and
say
that
he
be
aware
how
God
have
afflict
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
signora
just
touch
the
corner
of
her
eye
with
the
most
lovely
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs

<EOS>
yes
,
she
say
 
she
have
be
sorely
try
 
try
,
she
think
,
beyond
the
common
endurance
of
humanity
;
but
while
her
child
be
leave
to
her
,
everything
be
leave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
lord

"
she
exclaim
,
"
you
must
see
that
infant
 
<EOS>
the
last
bud
of
a
wondrous
tree

you
must
let
a
mother
hope
that
you
will
lay
your
holy
hand
on
her
innocent
head
and
consecrate
her
for
female
virtue

<EOS>
May
I
hope
it
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
look
into
the
bishop
's
eye
and
touch
the
bishop
's
arm
with
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
but
a
man
and
say
she
may
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
what
be
it
but
a
request
that
he
would
confirm
her
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
a
request
,
indeed
,
very
unnecessary
to
make
,
as
he
should
do
so
as
a
matter
of
course
if
the
young
lady
come
forward
in
the
usual
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
blood
of
Tiberius
,
"
say
the
signora
in
all
but
a
whisper
;
"
the
blood
of
Tiberius
flow
in
her
vein
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
last
of
the
Neros
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
hear
of
the
last
of
the
visigoth
,
and
have
float
in
his
brain
some
indistinct
idea
of
the
last
of
the
Mohicans
,
but
to
have
the
last
of
the
Neros
thus
bring
before
him
for
a
blessing
be
very
staggering
.
<EOS>
still
he
like
the
lady
:
she
have
a
proper
way
of
thinking
and
talk
with
more
propriety
than
her
brother
.
<EOS>
but
who
be
they
?
<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
clear
that
that
blue
madman
with
the
silky
beard
be
not
a
Prince
Vicinironi
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
married
and
be
of
course
one
of
the
Vicinironi
's
by
right
of
the
husband
.
<EOS>
so
the
bishop
go
on
learn
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
will
you
see
her
?
<EOS>
say
the
signora
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
see
whom
?
"
say
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
child
,
"
say
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
young
lady
's
age
?
"
ask
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
just
seven
,
"
say
the
signora
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
shake
his
head
;
"
she
be
much
too
young
 
very
much
too
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
in
sunny
Italy
,
you
know
,
we
do
not
count
by
year
,
"
and
the
signora
give
the
bishop
one
of
her
very
sweetest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
indeed
,
she
be
a
great
deal
too
young
,
"
persist
the
bishop
;
"
we
never
confirm
before
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
you
may
speak
to
her
;
you
may
let
her
hear
from
your
consecrate
lip
that
she
be
not
a
castaway
because
she
be
a
Roman
;
that
she
may
be
a
Nero
and
yet
a
Christian
;
that
she
may
owe
her
black
lock
and
dark
cheek
to
the
blood
of
the
pagan
Caesars
,
and
yet
herself
be
a
child
of
grace
;
you
will
tell
her
this
,
will
not
you
,
my
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
friend
say
he
would
,
and
ask
if
the
child
could
say
her
catechism
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
signora
,
"
I
would
not
allow
her
to
learn
lesson
such
as
those
in
a
land
ride
over
by
priest
and
pollute
by
the
idolatry
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
,
here
in
Barchester
,
that
she
must
first
be
teach
to
lisp
those
holy
word
.
<EOS>
oh
,
that
you
could
be
her
instructor
!
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
Dr.
Proudie
certainly
like
the
lady
,
but
,
see
that
he
be
a
bishop
,
it
be
not
probable
that
he
be
go
to
instruct
a
little
girl
in
the
first
rudiment
of
her
catechism
;
so
he
say
he
would
send
a
teacher
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
see
her
yourself
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
say
he
would
,
but
where
should
he
call
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
Papa
's
house
,
"
say
the
Signora
with
an
air
of
some
little
surprise
at
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
actually
want
the
courage
to
ask
her
who
be
her
papa
,
so
he
be
force
at
last
to
leave
her
without
fathom
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
in
her
second
good
,
have
now
return
to
the
room
,
and
her
husband
think
it
as
well
that
he
should
not
remain
in
too
close
conversation
with
the
lady
whom
his
wife
appear
to
hold
in
such
slight
esteem
.
<EOS>
presently
he
come
across
his
young
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Netta

"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
who
be

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
Vicinironi

Netta
;

but
Vesey
Neroni
,

<EOS>
she
be
Doctor
Stanhope

I
must
go
and
do
the
civil
to
Griselda
grantly

I
declare
nobody
have
speak
a

to
the
poor
girl
this
evening

Dr.

Dr.

Dr.

Stanhope

daughter

of
whose
marriage
with
a
dissolute
italian
scamp
he
now
remember
to
have

and
that
impertinent
blue
cub
who
have
examine
him

daughter
of
one
of

as
these
thing
flash
across
his
mind
,
he
be
nearly
as
angry
as
his

have
be

nevertheless
,
he
could
not

own
that
the
mother
of

an
agreeable
woman

<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
trip
out
into
the
adjoining
room
,
in
which
be
congregate
a
crowd
of
Grantlyite
clergyman
,
among
whom
the
archdeacon
be
stand
pre

eminent
,
while
the
old
dean
be
sit
nearly
bury
in
a
huge
arm
chair
by
the
fire

place

<EOS>
the
bishop
be
very
anxious
to
be
gracious
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
diminish
the
bitterness
which
his
chaplain
have
occasion
.
<EOS>
let
Mr.
Slope
do
the
_

,
he
himself
would
pour
in
the

.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
stir
,
Mr.
Dean
,
pray
do
not

"
he
say
as
the
old
man
essay
to
get
up
;

I
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
,
your
come
to
such
an

we
have
hardly
get
settle
yet

have
not
be
able
to
see
her
friend
as
she
would
wish
to
do

<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
,
after
all
,
we
have
not

so
hard
upon
you
at

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
"
you
have
only
draw
our
tooth

cut
out
our

you
have
allow
us
still
to
breathe

<EOS>
"

it

out

magnate

in

it

very
odd
if
the
head

college
do

way
quite

fully
as

I
think
you
have
bungle
it

at
any

you
must
own
this

now

never

talk

<EOS>
the
bishop

look
round

perceive
that
that
abominable
young
Stanhope
have
pursue
him

<EOS>
the

stare
at
him
as

in

at
Oxford

I
believe

they
only
profess
to
do
so

that

You

there
be

dignified

sixty

could
not

such
a

"
have
you

now
the

professor
 
"
  
the
insult
be
become
too
deep
for
the
spirit

walk
off

another

follow

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
your
own
view
may

Mr.
Harding
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
be
very
simply
tell
,
my
lord
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
to
take
the
place
if
it
be
offer
me
,
and
to
put
up
with
the
want
of
it
should
another
man
get
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
profess
himself
delight
to
hear
it
;
Mr.
Harding
may
be
quite
sure
that
no
other
man
would
get
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
few
circumstance
which
would
in
a
slight
degree
change
the
nature
of
the
duty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
probably
aware
of
this
,
and
would
,
perhaps
,
not
object
to
discuss
the
matter
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subject
to
which
Mr.
Slope
have
give
a
good
deal
of
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
feel
,
he
know
not
why
,
oppress
and
annoy
.
<EOS>
what
could
Mr.
Slope
do
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
know
that
there
be
to
be
change
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
them
must
be
communicate
to
the
warden
through
somebody
,
and
through
whom
so
naturally
as
the
bishop
's
chaplain
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
try
to
argue
himself
back
to
an
easy
mind
,
but
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
in
the
meantime
have
take
the
seat
which
the
bishop
have
vacate
on
the
signora
's
sofa
,
and
remain
with
that
lady
till
it
be
time
to
marshal
the
folk
to
supper
.
<EOS>
not
with
contented
eye
have
Mrs.
Proudie
see
this
.
<EOS>
have
not
this
woman
laugh
at
her
distress
,
and
have
not
Mr.
Slope
hear
it
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
an
intriguing
italian
woman
,
half
wife
and
half
not
,
full
of
affectation
,
air
,
and
impudence
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
horribly
bedizen
with
velvet
and
pearl
,
with
velvet
and
pearl
,
too
,
which
have
not
be
tear
off
her
back
?
<EOS>
above
all
,
do
she
not
pretend
to
be
more
beautiful
than
her
neighbour
?
<EOS>
to
say
that
Mrs.
Proudie
be
jealous
would
give
a
wrong
idea
of
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
the
slight
desire
that
Mr.
Slope
should
be
in
love
with
herself
.
<EOS>
but
she
desire
the
incense
of
Mr.
Slope
's
spiritual
and
temporal
service
,
and
do
not
choose
that
they
should
be
turn
out
of
their
course
to
such
an
object
as
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
She
consider
also
that
Mr.
Slope
ought
in
duty
to
hate
the
signora
,
and
it
appear
from
his
manner
that
he
be
very
far
from
hate
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
say
,
sweep
by
and
look
all
that
she
feel
,
"
can
not
you
make
yourself
useful
?
<EOS>
do
pray
take
Mrs.
Grantly
down
to
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
hear
and
escape
.
<EOS>
the
word
be
hardly
out
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
mouth
before
the
intend
victim
have
stick
her
hand
through
the
arm
of
one
of
her
husband
's
curate
and
save
herself
.
<EOS>
what
would
the
archdeacon
have
say
have
he
see
her
walk
downstairs
with
Mr.
Slope
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
hear
also
,
but
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
obedient
as
be
expect
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
period
of
Mr.
Slope
's
obedience
to
Mrs.
Proudie
be
draw
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
wish
yet
to
break
with
her
,
nor
to
break
with
her
at
all
,
if
it
could
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
but
he
intend
to
be
master
in
that
palace
,
and
as
she
have
make
the
same
resolution
it
be
not
improbable
that
they
may
come
to
blow
.
  
<EOS>
before
leave
the
signora
he
arrange
a
little
table
before
her
and
beg
to
know
what
he
should
bring
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
indifferent
,
she
say
 
nothing
 
anything
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
she
feel
the
misery
of
her
position
,
now
that
she
must
be

alone
.
<EOS>
well
,
a
little
chicken
,
some
ham
,
and
a
glass
of
champagne

<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
to
explain
,
not
without
blush
for
his
patron
,
that
there
be
no
champagne
.
  
<EOS>
Sherry
would
do
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Slope
descend
with
the
learned
Miss
Trefoil
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Could
she
tell
him
,
he
ask
,
whether
the
fern
of
Barsetshire
be
equal
to
those
of
Cumberland
?
<EOS>
His
strong
worldly
passion
be
for
fern
 
<EOS>
and
before
she
could
answer
him
<EOS>
he
leave
her
wedge
between
the
door
and
the
sideboard
.
<EOS>
It
be
fifty
minute
before
she

and
even
then
unfed

<EOS>
"
You

say
the
watchful

above
the

of
the

<EOS>
Mr.

explain
that
the
Signora
Neroni

of
her

<EOS>
"

"
say
Mrs.

,
quite
out
loud
.
<EOS>
"
It

Mr.

<EOS>
Ethelbert

most
agreeably

in
the
furth
corner
of
the
room
,
make
himself
both
useful
and
agreeable
to
Mrs.

's
young
daughter

<EOS>
"
I
could
not

"
say
he
;
"
I
be
physically

"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
's
anger
be
increase
by
see
that
her
daughter
also
have
go
over
to
the
enemy
,
and
when
she
see
,
that
in
spite
of
her
remonstrance
,
in
the
tooth
of
her
positive
order
,
Mr.

go
off
to

<EOS>
"
I
can

and
then
,
after
fuss
and
fuming
for
a
few
minute
,
she
push
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
follow
Mr.

<EOS>
when

They

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
She
sweep
close
up
to
the
sofa
so
as
to
confront
the
guilty

stare
full
at
them
for
a
moment
,
and
then

Mr.

neither
could
nor
would
believe
anything
of
the

and
he
think
,
moreover
,
that
Mr.

be
rather
impertinent
to
call
himself
by
such
a
name
.
<EOS>
His
assured
friend
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
how
many
assure
friend
generally
fall
to
the
lot
of
a

in
this

?
<EOS>
and
by
what
process
be
they
make
?
<EOS>
and
how
much
of
such
process
have
take
place
as
yet
between
Mr.
Harding
and
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
could
not
help
ask
himself
these
question
as
he
read
and
re
-
read
the
note
before

<EOS>
He
answer

,
however
,
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
dear
SIR

I

S.

High

Monday
  
<EOS>
and
on
the
follow
morning
,
punctually
at
half
-
past
nine
,
he
knock
at
the
palace
door
and
ask
for
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
the

have
one
small

<EOS>
into
this
latter
Mr.

be
show
and
ask

sit
down

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
the
ex
-
warden
stand
up
at
the
window
look
into
the
garden
,
and
could
not
help
think
how
very
short
a
time
have
pass
since
the
whole
of
that
house
have
be
open
to
him
,
as
though
he
have
be
a
child
of
the
family
,
bear
and
breed
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
remember
how
the
old
servant
use
to
smile
as
they
open
the
door
to
him
;
how
the
familiar
butler
would
say
,
when
he
have
be
absent
a
few
hour
longer
than
usual
,
"
a
sight
of
you
,
Mr.
Harding
,
be
good
for
sore
eye
;
"
how
the
fussy
housekeeper
would
swear
that
he
could
not
have
dine
,
or
could
not
have
breakfast
,
or
could
not
have
lunch
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
above
all
,
he
remember
the
pleasant
gleam
of
inward
satisfaction
which
always
spread
itself
over
the
old
bishop
's
face
whenever
his
friend
enter
his
room
.
  
<EOS>
a
tear
come
into
each
eye
as
he
reflect
that
all
this
be
go
.
<EOS>
what
use
would
the
hospital
be
to
him
now
?
<EOS>
He
be
alone
in
the
world
,
and
get
old
;
he
would
soon
,
very
soon
have
to
go
and
leave
it
all
,
as
his
dear
old
friend
have
go
;
go
,
and
leave
the
hospital
,
and
his
accustomed
place
in
the
cathedral
,
and
his
haunt
and
pleasure
,
to
young
and
perhaps
wise
man
.
<EOS>
that
chant
of
his
!
<EOS>
perhaps
,
in
truth
,
the
time
for
it
be
go
by
.
<EOS>
He
feel
as
though
the
world
be
sink
from
his
foot
;
as
though
this
,
this
be
the
time
for
him
to
turn
with
confidence
to
those
hope
which
he
have
preach
with
confidence
to
other
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
"
can
a
man
's
religion
be
worth
if
it
do
not
support
him
against
the
natural
melancholy
of
decline
year
?
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
look
out
through
his
dimmed
eye
into
the
bright
parterre
of
the
bishop
's
garden
,
he
feel
that
he
have
the
support
which
he
want
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
do
not
like
to
be
thus
keep
wait
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Slope
do
not
really
wish
to
see
him
at
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
,
why
force
him
to
come
away
from
his
lodging
with
his
breakfast
in
his
throat
?
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
it
be
policy
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
make
up
his
mind
that
Mr.
Harding
should
either
accept
the
hospital
with
abject
submission
,
or
else
refuse
it
altogether
,
and
have
calculate
that
he
would
probably
be
more
quick
to
do
the
latter
,
if
he
could
be
get
to
enter
upon
the
subject
in
an
ill
-
humour
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Mr.
Slope
be
not
altogether
wrong
in
his
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
ten
when
Mr.
Slope
hurry
into
the
room
and
,
mutter
something
about
the
bishop
and
diocesan
duty
,
shake
Mr.
Harding
's
hand
ruthlessly
and
beg
him
to
be
seat
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
air
of
superiority
which
this
man
assume
do
go
against
the
grain
with
Mr.
Harding
,
and
yet
he
do
not
know
how
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
the
whole
tendency
of
his
mind
and
disposition
be
oppose
to
any
contra
-
assumption
of
grandeur
on
his
own
part
,
and
he
have
not
the
worldly
spirit
or
quickness
necessary
to
put
down
insolent
pretension
by
downright
and
open
rebuke
,
as
the
archdeacon
would
have
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
for
Mr.
Harding
but
to
submit
,
and
he
accordingly
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
the
hospital
,
Mr.
Harding
?
"
begin
Mr.
Slope
,
speak
of
it
as
the
head
of
a
college
at
Cambridge
may
speak
of
some
sizarship
which
have
to
be
dispose
of
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
cross
one
leg
over
another
,
and
then
one
hand
over
the
other
on
the
top
of
them
,
and
look
Mr.
Slope
in
the
face
;
but
he
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
fill
up
again
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
say
that
he
have
understand
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
you
know
,
the
income
will
be
very
much
reduce
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
wish
to
be
liberal
,
and
he
therefore
tell
the
government
that
he
think
it
ought
to
be
put
at
not
less
than
£
450
.
<EOS>
I
think
on
the
whole
the
bishop
be
right
,
for
though
the
service
require
will
not
be
of
a
very
onerous
nature
,
they
will
be
more
so
than
they
be
before
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
,
perhaps
,
well
that
the
clergy
immediately
attach
to
the
cathedral
town
should
be
make
as
comfortable
as
the
extent
of
the
ecclesiastical
mean
at
our
disposal
will
allow
.
<EOS>
those
be
the
bishop
's
idea
,
and
I
must
say
mine
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
sit
rub
one
hand
on
the
other
,
but
say
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
for
the
income
,
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
the
house
will
,
of
course
,
remain
to
the
warden
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
It
should
,
however
,
I
think
,
be
stipulate
that
he
should
paint
inside
every
seven
year
,
and
outside
every
three
year
,
and
be
subject
to
dilapidation
,
in
the
event
of
vacate
,
either
by
death
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
matter
on
which
the
bishop
must
yet
be
consult
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
still
rub
his
hand
and
still
sit
silent
,
gaze
up
into
Mr.
Slope
's
unprepossessing
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
as
to
the
duty
,
"
continue
he
,
"
I
believe
,
if
I
be
rightly
inform
,
there
can
hardly
be
say
to
have
be
any
duty
hitherto
,
"
and
he
give
a
sort
of
half
-
laugh
,
as
though
to
pass
off
the
accusation
in
the
guise
of
a
pleasantry
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
think
of
the
happy
,
easy
year
he
have
pass
in
his
old
home
;
of
the
wear
-
out
,
aged
man
whom
he
have
succour
;
of
his
good
intention
;
and
of
his
work
,
which
have
certainly
be
of
the
light
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
these
thing
,
doubt
for
a
moment
whether
he
do
or
do
not
deserve
the
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
He
give
his
enemy
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
and
do
not
rebuke
him
.
<EOS>
He
merely
observe
,
very
tranquilly
,
and
perhaps
with
too
much
humility
,
that
the
duty
of
the
situation
,
such
as
they
be
,
have
,
he
believe
,
be
do
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
late
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
smile
,
and
this
time
the
smile
be
intend
to
operate
against
the
memory
of
the
late
bishop
rather
than
against
the
energy
of
the
ex
-
warden
;
so
it
be
understand
by
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
the
colour
rise
to
his
cheek
,
and
he
begin
to
feel
very
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
aware
,
Mr.
Harding
,
that
thing
be
a
good
deal
change
in
Barchester
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
say
that
he
be
aware
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
not
only
in
Barchester
,
Mr.
Harding
,
but
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
in
Barchester
that
a
new
man
be
carry
out
new
measure
and
cast
away
the
useless
rubbish
of
past
century
.
<EOS>
the
same
thing
be
go
on
throughout
the
country
.
<EOS>
work

now

from
every
man
who
receive

they
who
have

the
doing
of
work

the
paying
of
wage

be
bind
to

out

<EOS>
new

Mr.
Harding
,

now
need
and
be
now
forthcoming
in
the
church
,
as
well
as
in
other
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
wormwood
to
our
old
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
rate
very
high
his
own
ability
or
activity
,
but
all
the
feeling
of
his
heart
be
with
the
old
clergy
,
and
any
antipathy
of
which
his
heart
be
susceptible
be
direct
against
those
new
,
busy
,
uncharitable
,
self
-
laud
man
,
of
whom
Mr.
Slope
be
so
good
an
example
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
bishop
will
prefer
a
new
man
at
the
hospital
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
no
means
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
be
very
anxious
that
you
should
accept
the
appointment
,
but
he
wish
you
should
understand
beforehand
what
will
be
the
require
duty
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
a
Sabbath
-
day
school
will
be
attach
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
for
the
old
man
?
"
ask
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Harding
,
not
for
the
old
man
,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
of
such
of
the
poor
of
Barchester
as
it
may
suit
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
will
expect
that
you
shall
attend
this
school
,
and
that
the
teacher
shall
be
under
your
inspection
and
care
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
slip
his
topmost
hand
off
the
other
and
begin
to
rub
the
calf
of
the
leg
which
be
support
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
old
man
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
,
"
and
the
old
woman
who
be
to
form
a
part
of
the
hospital
,
the
bishop
be
desirous
that
you
shall
have
morning
and
evening
service
on
the
premise
every
Sabbath
,
and
one
weekday
service
;
that
you
shall
preach
to
them
once
at
least
on
Sundays
;
and
that
the
whole
hospital
be
always
collect
for
morning
and
evening
prayer
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
think
that
this
will
render
it
unnecessary
that
any
separate
seat
in
the
cathedral
should
be
reserve
for
the
hospital
inmate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
pause
,
but
Mr.
Harding
still
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
seat
for
the
woman
;
on
the
whole
,
Mr.
Harding
,
I
may
as
well
say
at
once
,
that
for
people
of
that
class
the
cathedral
service
do
not
appear
to
me
the
most
useful
 
even
if
it
be
so
for
any
class
of
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
discuss
that
,
if
you
please
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
desirous
of
do
so
;
at
least
,
not
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
however
,
you
fully
understand
the
bishop
's
wish
about
the
new
establishment
of
the
hospital
;
and
if
,
as
I
do
not
doubt
,
I
shall
receive
from
you
an
assurance
that
you
accord
with
his
lordship
's
view
,
it
will
give
me
very
great
pleasure
to
be
the
bearer
from
his
lordship

you
of
the
presentation

<EOS>

I

ask
Mr.

Mr.

again
ask
the

"
if
such
unfortunately
should
be
the
case

I
can
hardly
conceive

I
presume
your
own
feeling

dictate
to
you
the
propriety
of
decline
the
appointment

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
accept
the
appointment
and
yet
disagree
with
the
bishop
,
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
question
rather
bother
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
talk
the
matter
over
with
the
bishop
and
have
receive
a
sort
of
authority
for
suggest
to
Mr.
Harding
the
propriety
of
a
Sunday
school
and
certain
hospital
service
,
but
he
have
no
authority
for
say
that
these
proposition
be
to
be
make
peremptory
condition
attach
to
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
's
idea
have
be
that
Mr.
Harding
would
of
course
consent
and
that
the
school
would
become
,
like
the
rest
of
those
new
establishment
in
the
city
,
under
the
control
of
his
wife
and
his
chaplain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
idea
have
be
more
correct
.
<EOS>
He
intend
that
Mr.
Harding
should
refuse
the
situation
,
and
that
an
ally
of
his
own
should
get
it
,
but
he
have
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
Mr.
Harding
openly
accept
the
appointment
and
as
openly
reject
the
condition
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
,
I
presume
,
probable
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
will
accept
from
the
hand
of
the
bishop
a
piece
of
preferment
with
a
fix
predetermination
to
disacknowledge
the
duty
attach
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
become
warden
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
"
and
neglect
my
duty
,
the
bishop
have
mean
by
which
he
can
remedy
the
grievance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
expect
such
an
argument
from
you
,
or
I
may
say
the
suggestion
of
such
a
line
of
conduct
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
with
a
great
look
of
injure
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
do
I
expect
such
a
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
at
any
rate
to
know
what
answer
I
be
to

to
his
lordship

Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
an
early
opportunity

see
his
lordship
myself

"

Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
an
arrangement
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
"
will
hardly
give
his
lordship
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
impossible
that
the
bishop
should
himself
see
every
clergyman
in
the
diocese
on
every
subject
of
patronage
that
may
arise
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
I
believe
,
do
see
you
on
the
matter
,
and
I
really
can
not
see
why
he
should
be
troubled
to
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
Mr.
Slope
,
how
long
I
have
be
officiate
as
a
clergyman
in
this
city
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
wish
be
now
nearly
fulfil
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
become
angry
,
and
it
be
probable
that
he
may
commit
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
see
what
that
have
to
do
with
the
question
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
the
bishop
would
be
justify
in
allow
you
to
regard
as
a
sinecure
a
situation
that
require
an
active
,
man
merely
because
you
have
be
employ
for
many
year
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
may
induce
the
bishop
to
see
me
,
if
I
ask
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
consult
my
friend
in
this
matter
,
Mr.
Slope
;
but
I
mean
to
be
guilty
of
no
subterfuge
 
<EOS>
you
may
tell
the
bishop
that
as
I
altogether
disagree
with
his
view
about
the
hospital
,
I
shall
decline
the
situation
if
I
find
that
any
such
condition
be
attach
to
it
as
those
you
have
suggest
;
"
and
so
say
,
Mr.
Harding
take
his
hat
and
go
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
content
.
<EOS>
He
consider
himself
at
liberty
to
accept
Mr.
Harding
's
last
speech
as
an
absolute
refusal
of
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
he
so
represent
it
to
the
bishop
and
to
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
surprising
,
"
say
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
you
little
know
how

I

<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
not
a
happy
man
as
he
walk
down
the
palace
pathway
and
step
out
into
the
close
.
<EOS>
His
preferment
and
pleasant
house
be
a
second
time
go
from
him
,
but
that
he
could
endure
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
school
and
insult
by
a
man
young
enough
to
be
his
son
,
but
that
he
could
put
up
with
.
<EOS>
He
could
even
draw
from
the
very
injury
which
have
be
inflict
on
him
some
of
that
consolation
which
we
may
believe
martyr
always
receive
from
the
injustice
of
their
own
suffering
,
and
which
be
generally
proportion
in
its
strength
to
the
extent
of
cruelty
with
which
martyr
be
treat
.
<EOS>
He
have
admit
to
his
daughter
that
he
want
the
comfort
of
his
old
home
,
and
yet
he
could
have
return
to
his
lodging
in
the
High
Street
,
if
not
with
exaltation
,
at
least
with
satisfaction
,
have
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
but
the
venom
of
the
chaplain
's
harangue
have
work
into
his
blood
,
and
sap
the
life
of
his
sweet
contentment

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
what
cruel

these
have
be
;
and
how
often
be
they
now
use
with
all
the
heartless
cruelty

a

either
in

he
do
not
belong

some
new

the

<EOS>
He
may
then
regard
himself
as

<EOS>
a

be
nothing

within

a
full
appreciation

an
era

it

seem

neither

very
desirable

in
which
success

touchstone

We

We

<EOS>
new

the

englishman
who

<EOS>
alas

alas

<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
Mr.
Harding
could
not
but
feel
that
he
be
an
Englishman
who
do
not
know
how

<EOS>
this
new
doctrine
of
Mr.
Slope
and
the
rubbish
cart
,
new
at
least
at
Barchester
,
sadly
disturb
his
equanimity
.
  
<EOS>
"
the

throughout
the
whole

<EOS>
work

"
<EOS>
and
have
he
be
live
all
his

receive
wage
and
do
no
work
?
<EOS>
have
he
in
truth
so
live
as
to
be
now
in
his
old
age
justly
reckon
as
rubbish
fit
only
to
be
hide
away
in
some
huge
dust
-
hole
?
<EOS>
the
school
of
man
to
whom
he
profess
to
belong
,
the
Grantlys
,
the
Gwynnes
,
and
the
old
high
set
of
Oxford
divine
,
be
afflict
with
no
such
self
-
accusation
as
these
which
trouble
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
They
,
as
a
rule
,
be
as
satisfied
with
the
wisdom
and
propriety
of
their
own
conduct
as
can
be
any
Mr.
Slope
,
or
any
Dr.
Proudie
,
with
his
own
.
<EOS>
but
unfortunately
for
himself
Mr.
Harding
have
little
of
this
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
when
he
hear
himself
designate
as
rubbish
by
the
Slopes
of
the
world
,
he
have
no
other
resource
than
to
make
inquiry
within
his
own
bosom
as
to
the
truth
of
the
designation
.
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
evidence
seem
generally
to
go
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
profess
to
himself
in
the
bishop
's
parlour
that
in
these
come
source
of
the
sorrow
of
age
,
in
these
fit
of
sad
regret
from
which
the
latter
year
of
few
reflect
man
can
be
free
,
religion
would
suffice
to
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
yes
,
religion
could
console
him
for
the
loss
of
any
worldly
good
,
but
be
his
religion
of
that
active
sort
which
would
enable
him
so
to
repent
of
misspent
year
as
to
pass
those
that
be
leave
to
him
in
a
spirit
of
hope
for
the
future
?
<EOS>
and
such
repentance
itself
,
be
it
not
a
work
of
agony
and
of
tear
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
easy
to
talk
of
repentance
,
but
a
man
have
to
walk
over
hot
ploughshare
before
he
can
complete
it
;
to
be
skin
alive
as
be
St.
Bartholomew
;
to
be
stick
full
of
arrow
as
be
St.
Sebastian
;
to
lie
broil
on
a
gridiron
like
St.
Lorenzo
!
<EOS>
how
if
his
past
life
require
such
repentance
as
this
?
<EOS>
have
he
the
energy
to
go
through
with
it
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
after
leave
the
palace
,
walk
slowly
for
an
hour
or
so
beneath
the
shady
elm
of
the
close
and
then
betook
himself
to
his
daughter
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
at
any
rate
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
out
to
Plumstead
to
consult
Dr.
Grantly
,
and
that
he
would
in
the
first
instance
tell
Eleanor
what
have
occur
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
he
be
doom
to
undergo
another
misery
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
forestall
him
at
the
widow
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
there
on
the
precede
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
he
have
say
,
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
tell
Mrs.
Bold
that
her
father
be
about
to
return
to
the
pretty
house
at
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
instruct
by
the
bishop
to
inform
Mr.
Harding
that
the
appointment
would
now
be
make
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
of
course
only
too
happy
to
be
able
to
be
the
mean
of
restore
to
Mr.
Harding
the
preferment
which
he
have
so
long
adorn
.
<EOS>
and
then
by
degree
Mr.
Slope
have
introduce
the
subject
of
the
pretty
school
which
he
hope
before
long
to
see
attach
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
have
quite
fascinate
Mrs.
Bold
by
his
description
of
this
picturesque
,
useful
,
and
charitable
appendage
,
and
she
have
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
have
no
doubt
her
father
would
approve
,
and
that
she
herself
would
gladly
undertake
a
class
.
  
<EOS>
anyone
who
have
hear
the
entirely
different
tone
and
see
the
entirely
different
manner
in
which
Mr.
Slope
have
speak
of
this
project
institution
to
the
daughter
and
to
the
father
could
not
have
fail
to
own
that
Mr.
Slope
be
a
man
of
genius
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
to
Mrs.
Bold
about
the
hospital
sermon
and
service
,
nothing
about
the
exclusion
of
the
old
man
from
the
cathedral
,
nothing
about
dilapidation
and
painting
,
nothing
about
cart
away
the
rubbish
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
say
to
herself
that
certainly
she
do
not
like
Mr.
Slope
personally
,
but
that
he
be
a
very
active
,
zealous
clergyman
and
would
no
doubt
be
useful
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
all
this
pave
the
way
for
much
additional
misery
to
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
put
on
her
happy
face
as
she
hear
her
father
on
the
stair
,
for
she
think
she
have
only
to
congratulate
him
;
but
directly
she
see
his
face
she
know
that
there
be
but
little
matter
for
congratulation
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
him
with
the
same
weary
look
of
sorrow
on
one
or
two
occasion
before
,
and
remember
it
well
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
him
when
he
first
read
that
attack
upon
himself
in
"
the
Jupiter
"
which
have
ultimately
cause
him
to
resign
the
hospital
,
and
she
have
see
him
also
when
the
archdeacon
have
persuade
him
to
remain
there
against
his
own
sense
of
propriety
and
honour
.
<EOS>
She
know
at
a
glance
that
his
spirit
be
in
deep
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Papa
,
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
put
down
her
boy
to
crawl
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
tell
you
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
I
be
go
out
to
plumstead

<EOS>
to
Plumstead

<EOS>
Shall
you
stay
there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
suppose
I
shall
,
to

night

I
must
consult
the
archdeacon
about
this
weary
hospital

<EOS>
ah
me
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
never
think
of
it
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Papa

what
be
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
with
Mr.
Slope
,
my
dear

and
he
be
not
the
pleasantest
companion
in
the
world

at
least
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
give
a
sort
of
half
-
blush
,
but
she
be
wrong
if
she
imagine
that
her
father
in
any
way
allude
to
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Papa

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
want
to
turn
the
hospital
into
a
Sunday
-
school
and
a
preach
-
house
,
and
I
suppose
he
will
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
myself
adapt
for
such
an
establishment
,
and
therefore
,
I
suppose
,
I
must
refuse
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
be
the
harm
of
the
school
,
Papa

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
want
of
a
proper
schoolmaster
,
my
dear

<EOS>

that
would
of
course
be
supply

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
wish
to
supply
it
by
make
me
his
schoolmaster

<EOS>
but
as
I
be
hardly
fit
for
such
work

I
intend
to
decline
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

Papa

<EOS>
Mr.

do
not
intend

what
he
intend
 
"
  
"
He
be
here
yesterday

be
he

"
ask
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Papa
.
"
  
"
and
talk
about
the
hospital
?
"
  
"
He
be
say
how
glad
he
would
be
,
and
the
bishop
too
,
to
see
you
back
there
again
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
speak
about
the
Sunday
-
school
;
and
to
tell
the
truth
I
agree
with
him
;
and
I
think
you
would
have
do
so
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
speak
of
a
school
,
not
inside
the
hospital
,
but
just
connect
with
it
,
of
which
you
would
be
the
patron
and
visitor
;
and
I
think
you
would
have
like
such
a
school
as
that
;
and
I
promise
to
look
after
it
and
to
take
a
class
 
<EOS>
and
it
all
seem
so
very
 
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
so
miserable
if
I
find
I
have
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
wrong
at
all
,
my

"
say
he
gently
,
very
gently
reject
his
daughter
's
caress
.
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
nothing
wrong
in
your
wishing
to
make
yourself
useful
;
indeed
,
you
ought
to
do
so
by
all
mean

<EOS>
everyone
must
now
exert
himself
who

not

go

"
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
thus
attempt
in
his
misery
to
preach
the
new
doctrine
to
his
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Himself
or
herself
,
it
be
all
the

"
he
continue
;
"
you
will
be
quite
right
,
my
dear
,
to
do
something
of
this
sort

"
  
"
well

Papa

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

I
never

do
so

"
  
<EOS>

It
would
be
very
wicked
of
me
to
speak
evil
of
him

for
to
tell
the
truth

I
know
no
evil
of
him

I
be
not
quite
sure
that
he
be
honest

that

be
not
gentlemanlike

manner

I
be

I
never

as
for
myself

my

continue
he
,
"
we
know
the
old
proverb

"
It
be
bad
teach
an
old
dog
trick

<EOS>
"
I
must
decline
the
Sunday

school

shall
therefore
probably
decline
the
hospital
also
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
first
see
your
brother
-
in

law

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
he
take
up
his
hat
,
kiss
the
baby
,
and
withdraw
,
leave
Eleanor
in
as
low
spirit
as
himself
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
a
great
aggravation
to
his
misery
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
few
with
whom
to
sympathize
that
he
could
not
afford
to
be
cut
off
from
the
one
whose
sympathy
be
of
the
most
value
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
seem
probable
that
this
would
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
own
to
himself
that
he
wish
his
daughter
to
hate
Mr.
Slope
,
yet
have
she
express
such
a
feeling
there
would
have
be
very
little
bitterness
in
the
rebuke
he
would
have
give
her
for
so
uncharitable
a
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
the
fact
,
however
,
be
that
she
be
on
friendly
term
with
Mr.
Slope
,
that
she
coincide
with
his
view
,
adhere
at
once
to
his
plan
,
and
listen
with
delight
to
his
teaching
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
hardly
wish
his
daughter
to
hate
the
man
,
but
he
would
have
prefer
that
to
her
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
away
to
the
inn
to
order
a
fly
,
go
home
to
put
up
his
carpet
-
bag
,
and
then
start
for
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
at
any
rate
,
no
danger
that
the
archdeacon
would
fraternize
with
Mr.
Slope
;
but
then
he
would
recommend
internecine
war
,
public
appeal
,
loud
reproach
,
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
open
battle
.
<EOS>
now
that
alternative
be
hardly
more
to
Mr.
Harding
's
taste
than
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Harding
reach
the
parsonage
,
he
find
that
the
archdeacon
be
out
,
and
would
not
be
home
till
dinnertime
,
so
he
begin
his
complaint
to
his
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
entertain
quite
as
strong
an
antagonism
to
Mr.
Slope
as
do
her
husband
;
she
be
also
quite
as
alive
to
the
necessity
of
combat
the
Proudie
faction
,
of
support
the
old
church
interest
of
the
close
,
of
keep
in
her
own
set
such
of
the
loaf
and
fish
as
duly
belong
to
it
;
and
be
quite
as
well
prepared
as
her
lord
to
carry
on
the
battle
without
give
or
take
quarter
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
be
a
woman
prone
to
quarrel
,
or
ill
-
inclined
to
live
at
peace
with
her
clerical
neighbour
;
but
she
feel
,
as
do
the
archdeacon
,
that
the
presence
of
Mr.
Slope
in
Barchester
be
an
insult
to
everyone
connect
with
the
late
bishop
,
and
that
his
assume
dominion
in
the
diocese
be
a
spiritual
injury
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
people
have
little
guess
how
bitter
Mrs.
grantly
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
live
on
the
good
of
term
with
all
the
rector
"
wife
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
popular
with
all
the
lady
connect
with
the
close
.
<EOS>
though
much
the
wealthy
of
the
ecclesiastical
matron
of
the
county
,
she
have
so
manage
her
affair
that
her
carriage
and
horse
have
give
umbrage
to
none
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
throw
herself
among
the
county
grandee
so
as
to
excite
the
envy
of
other
clergyman
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
never
talk
too
loudly
of
earl
and
countess
,
or
boast
that
she
give
her
governess
sixty
pound
a
year
,
or
her
cook
seventy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
live
the
life
of
a
wise
,
discreet
,
peace
-
make
woman
,
and
the
people
of
Barchester
be
surprise
at
the
amount
of
military
vigour
she
display
as
general
of
the
feminine
Grantlyite
force
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
soon
learn
that
her
sister
Eleanor
have
promise
to
assist
Mr.
Slope
in
the
affair
of
the
hospital
school
,
and
it
be
on
this
point
that
her
attention
first
fix
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
Eleanor
endure
him
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
very
crafty
man
,
"
say
her
father
,
"
and
his
craft
have
be
successful
in
make
Eleanor
think
that
he
be
a
meek
,
charitable
,
good
clergyman
.
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
if
I
wrong
him
,
but
such
be
not
his
true
character
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
true
character
,
indeed
!
"
say
she
,
with
something
approach
scorn
for
her
father
's
moderation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
only
hope
he
will
not
have
craft
enough
to
make
Eleanor
forget
herself
and
her
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
mean
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
startle
out
of
his
usual
demeanour
by
the
abruptness
and
horror
of
so
dreadful
a
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
there
so
improbable
in
it
?
<EOS>
of
course
that
would
be
his
own
object
if
he
think
he
have
any
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
a
thousand
a
year
entirely
at
her
own
disposal
,
and
what
well
fortune
could
fall
to
Mr.
Slope
's
lot
than
the
transferring
of
the
disposal
of
such
a
fortune
to
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
not
think
she
like
him
,
Susan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
say
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
not
she
like
him
?
<EOS>
He
be
just
the
sort
of
man
to
get
on
with
a
woman
leave
,
as
she
be
,
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
after
her
!
"
say
the
unhappy
father
;
"
do
not
we
look
after
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Papa
,
how
innocent
you
be
!
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
to
be
expect
that
Eleanor
should
marry
again
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
the
last
to
advise
her
against
it
,
if
she
would
only
wait
the
proper
time
,
and
then
marry
at
least
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
really
mean
to
say
that
you
suppose
Eleanor
have
ever
think
of
marry
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
why
,
Mr.
Bold
have
only
be
dead
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
eighteen
month
,
"
say
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
suppose
Eleanor
have
ever
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
probable
,
though
,
that
he
have
;
and
that
he
will
try
and
make
her
do
so
;
and
that
he
will
succeed
too
,
if
we
do
not
take
care
what
we
be
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
quite
a
new
phase
of
the
affair
to
poor
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
to
have
thrust
upon
him
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
as
the
husband
of
his
favourite
child
,
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
really
positively
dislike
,
would
be
a
misfortune
which
he
feel
he
would
not
know
how
to
endure
patiently
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
could
there
be
any
ground
for
so
dreadful
a
surmise
?
<EOS>
in
all
worldly
matter
he
be
apt
to
look
upon
the
opinion
of
his
eld
daughter
as
one
generally
sound
and
trustworthy
.
<EOS>
in
her
appreciation
of
character
,
of
motive
,
and
the
probable
conduct
both
of
man
and
woman
,
she
be
usually
not
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
have
early
foresee
the
marriage
of
Eleanor
and
John
Bold
;
she
have
at
a
glance
decipher
the
character
of
the
new
bishop
and
his
chaplain
;
could
it
possibly
be
that
her
present
surmise
should
ever
come
forth
as
true
?
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
think
that
she
like
him
?
"
say
Mr.
Harding
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Papa
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
think
she
dislike
him
as
she
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
why
be
he
visit
there
as
a
confidential
friend
,
when
he
never
ought
to
have
be
admit
inside
the
house
?
<EOS>
why
be
it
that
she
speak
to
him
about
your
welfare
and
your
position
,
as
she
clearly
have
do
?
<EOS>
at
the
bishop
's
party
the
other
night
I
see
her
talk
to
him
for
half
an
hour
at
the
stretch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Slope
seem
to
talk
to
nobody
there
but
that
daughter
of
Stanhope
's
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
wish
to
defend
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Slope
be
a
clever
man
than
you
think
of
,
Papa
,
and
keep
more
than
one
iron
in
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
give
Eleanor
her
due
,
any
suspicion
as
to
the
slight
inclination
on
her
part
towards
Mr.
Slope
be
a
wrong
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
more
idea
of
marry
Mr.
Slope
than
she
have
of
marry
the
bishop
,
and
the
idea
that
Mr.
Slope
would
present
himself
as
a
suitor
have
never
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
give
her
her
due
again
,
she
have
never
think
about
suitor
since
her
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
it
be
true
that
she
have
overcome
all
that
repugnance
to
the
man
which
be
so
strongly
feel
for
him
by
the
rest
of
the
Grantly
faction
.
<EOS>
She
have
forgive
him
his
sermon
.
<EOS>
She
have
forgive
him
his
Low
Church
tendency
,
his
Sabbath
-
school
,
and
puritanical
observance
.
<EOS>
She
have
forgive
his
pharisaical
arrogance
,
and
even
his
greasy
face
and
oily
,
vulgar
manner
.
<EOS>
have
agree
to
overlook
such
offence
as
these
,
why
should
she
not
in
time
be
teach
to
regard
Mr.
Slope
as
a
suitor
?
  
<EOS>
and
as
to
him
,
it
must
also
be
affirm
that
he
be
hitherto
equally
innocent
of
the
crime
impute
to
him
.
<EOS>
how
it
have
come
to
pass
that
a
man
whose
eye
be
generally
so
widely
open
to
everything
around
him
have
not
perceive
that
this
young
widow
be
rich
as
well
as
beautiful
,
can
not
probably
now
be
explain
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
ingratiate
himself
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
merely
as
he
have
do
with
other
lady
,
in
order
to
strengthen
his
party
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
subsequently
amend
his
error
,
but
it
be
not
till
after
the
interview
between
him
and
Mr.
Harding
.
   
<EOS>
the
New
Champion
 
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
do
not
return
to
the
parsonage
till
close
upon
the
hour
of
dinner
,
and
there
be
therefore
no
time
to
discuss
matter
before
that
important
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
in
an
especial
good
humour
,
and
welcome
his
father
-
in
-
law
with
a
sort
of
jovial
earnestness
that
be
usual
with
him
when
thing
on
which
he
be
intent
be
go
on
as
he
would
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
settle
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
to
his
wife
as
he
wash
his
hand
in
his
dressing

room
,
while
she

accord
to
her
will
not

Arabin
have
agree
to
accept
the
living

He
will
be
here
next
week

"
<EOS>
and
the
archdeacon
scrub
his
hand
and
rub
his
face
with
a
violent
alacrity
,
which
show
that
Arabin
's
coming
be
a
great
point
gain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
come
here
to
Plumstead
?
"
say
the
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
promise
to
stay
a
month
with
us
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
"
so
that
he
may
see
what
his
parish
be
like
.
<EOS>
You
will
like
Arabin
very
much
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
gentleman
in
every
respect
,
and
full
of
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
queer
,
be
not
he
?
"
ask
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
he
be
a
little
odd
in
some
of
his
fancy

there
be
nothing
about
him
you
will
not
like

<EOS>
He
be
as
staunch
a
churchman
as
there
be
at
Oxford

<EOS>
I
really
do
not
know
what
we
should
do
without
Arabin
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
thing
for
me
to
have
him
so
near
me
,
and
if
anything
can
put
Slope
down
,
Arabin
will
do
it
.

Dr.
Gwynne

a

he

a

<EOS>
as
he
will
hereafter
be
bring
more
closely
to
our
notice
,
it
be
now
only
necessary
to
add
that
he
have
just
be
present
to
the
vicarage
of
St.
Ewold
by
Dr.
Grantly
,
in
whose
gift
as
archdeacon
the
living

St.
Ewold
be
a
parish
lie
just
without
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
the
suburb
of
the
new
town
,
indeed
,
be
partly
within
its
precinct

and
the
pretty
church
and
parsonage
be
not
much
above
a
mile
distant
from
the
city
gate

St.
Ewold
be
not
a
rich
piece
of
preferment
 
<EOS>
it
be
worth
some
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
at
most
,
and
have
generally
be
hold
by
a
clergyman
attach
to
the
cathedral
choir
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
however
,
feel
,
when
the
living
on
this
occasion
become
vacant
,
that
it
imperatively
behove
him
to
aid
the
force
of
his
party
with
some
tower
of
strength
,
if
any
such
tower
could
be
get
to
occupy
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
discuss
the
matter
with
his
brother
in
Barchester
,
not
in
any
weak
spirit
as
the
holder
of
patronage
to
be
use
for
his
own
or
his
family
's
benefit
,
but
as
one
to
whom
be
commit
a
trust
on
the
due
administration
of
which
much
of
the
church
's
welfare
may
depend
.
<EOS>
He
have
submit
to
them
the
name
of
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
though
the
choice
have
rest
with
them
all
in
conclave
,

they
have
unanimously
admit
that
,
if
Mr.

would
accept
St.

no

choice
could

be
make

if
Mr.

accept
St.

<EOS>
there
lie
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
man
stand
somewhat
prominently
before
the
world
,
that
is
,
before
the
Church
of
England
world
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
rich
man
,
it
be
true
,
for
he
hold
no
preferment
but
his
fellowship
;
but
he
be
a
man
not
over
-
anxious
for
rich
,
not
marry
of
course
,
and
one
whose
time
be
greatly
take
up
in
discuss
,
both
in
print

on
platform
,
the
privilege
and
practice
of
the
church
to
which
he
belong

<EOS>
as
the
archdeacon
have
do
battle
for
its
temporality
,
so
do
Mr.
Arabin
do
battle
for
its
spirituality
,
and
both
have
do
so
conscientiously
;
that
is
,
not
so
much
each
for
his
own
benefit
as
for
that
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
hold
such
a
position
as
Mr.
Arabin
do
,
there
be
much
reason
to
doubt
whether
he
would
consent
to
become
the
parson
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
and
Dr.
Grantly
have
take
the
trouble
to
go
himself
to
Oxford
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Dr.

together
have
succeed
in
persuade
this
eminent
divine
that
duty
require
him
to
go
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
there
be
wheel
within
wheel
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
past
Mr.
Arabin
have
be
engage
in
a
tremendous
controversy
with
no
less
a
person
than
Mr.
Slope
,
respect
the
apostolic
succession
.
<EOS>
these
two
gentleman
have
never
see
each
other
,
but
they
have
be
extremely
bitter
in
print
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
endeavour
to
strengthen
his
cause
by
call
Mr.
Arabin
an
owl
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
have
retaliate
by
hint
that
Mr.
Slope
be
an
infidel
.
<EOS>
this
battle
have
be
commence
in
the
column
of
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
a
powerful
newspaper
,
the
manager
of
which
be
very
friendly
to
Mr.
Slope
's
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
matter
,
however
,
have
become
too
tedious
for
the
reader
of
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
and
a
little
note
have
therefore
be
append
to
one
of
Mr.
Slope
's
most
tell
rejoinder
,
in
which
it
have
be
state
that
no
further
letter
from
the
reverend
gentleman
could
be
insert
except
as
advertisement
.
  
<EOS>
other
method
of
publication
be
,
however
,
find
,
less
expensive
than
advertisement
in
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
and
the
war
go
on
merrily
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
declare
that
the
main
part
of
the
consecration
of
a
clergyman
be
the
self
-
devotion
of
the
inner
man
to
the
duty
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
contend
that
a
man
be
not
consecrate
at
all
,
have
,
indeed
,
no
single
attribute
of
a
clergyman
,
unless
he
become
so
through
the
imposition
of
some
bishop
's
hand
,
who
have
become
a
bishop
through
the
imposition
of
other
hand
,
and
so
on
in
a
direct
line
to
one
of
the
apostle
.
<EOS>
each
have
repeatedly
hang
the
other
on
the
horn
of
a
dilemma
,
but
neither
seem
to
be
a
whit
the
bad
for
the
hanging
;
and
so
the
war
go
on
merrily
.
  
<EOS>
whether
or
no
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
foe
may
have
act
in
any
way
as
an
inducement
to
Mr.
Arabin
to
accept
the
living
of
St.
Ewold
,
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
it
have
at
any
rate
be
settle
in
Dr.
Gwynne
's
library
,
at
Lazarus
,
that
he
would
accept
it
,
and
that
he
would
lend
his
assistance
towards
drive
the
enemy
out
of
Barchester
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
silence
him
while
he
remain
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
intend
to
keep
his
room
at
Oxford
and
to
have
the
assistance
of
a
curate
at
St.
Ewold
,
but
he
promise
to
give
as
much
time
as
possible
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Barchester
,
and
from
so
great
a
man
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
be
quite
satisfied
with
such
a
promise
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
small
part
of
the
satisfaction
derivable
from
such
an
arrangement
that
Bishop
Proudie
would
be
force
to
institute
into
a
living
immediately
under
his
own
nose
the
enemy
of
his
favourite
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
all
through
dinner
the
archdeacon
's
good
humour
shine
brightly
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
eat
of
the
good
thing
heartily
,
he
drink
wine
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
he
talk
pleasantly
of
his
doing
at
Oxford
,
tell
his
father
-
in
-
law
that
he
ought
to
visit
Dr.
Gwynne
at
Lazarus
,
and
launch
out
again
in
praise
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Arabin
marry
,
Papa
?
"
ask
Griselda
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my

,
the
fellow
of
a
college
be
never
married

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
a
young
man
,
Papa
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
about
forty
,
I
believe
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Griselda
.
<EOS>
have
her
father
say
eighty
,
Mr.
Arabin
would
not
have
appear
to
her
to
be
very
much
old
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
two
gentleman
be
leave
alone
over
their
wine
,
Mr.
Harding
tell
his
tale
of
woe
.
<EOS>
but
even
this
,
sad
as
it
be
,
do
not
much
diminish
the
archdeacon
's
good
humour
,
though
it
greatly
add
to
his
pugnacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
do
it
,
"
say
Dr.
grantly
over
and
over
again
,
as
his
father
-
in
-
law
explain
to
him
the
term
on
which
the
new
warden
of
the
hospital
be
to
be
appoint
;
"
he
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
what
he
say
be
not
worth
the
trouble
of
listen
to
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
alter
the
duty
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
not
?
"
ask
the
ex
-
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
neither
the
bishop
nor
the
chaplain
,
nor
yet
the
bishop
's
wife
,
who
,
I
take
it
,
have
really
more
to
say
to
such
matter
than
either
of
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
the
whole
body
corporate
of
the
palace
together
have
no
power
to
turn
the
warden
of
the
hospital
into
a
Sunday
-
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
bishop
have
the
power
to
appoint
whom
he
please
,
and
 
"
  
"
I
do
not
know
that
;
I
rather
think
he
will
find
he
have
no
such
power
.
<EOS>
let
him
try
it
,
and
see
what
the
press
will
say
.
<EOS>
for
once
we
shall
have
the
popular
cry
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
but
Proudie
,
ass
as
he
be
,
know
the
world
too
well
to
get
such
a
hornet
's
nest
about
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
wince
at
the
idea
of
the
press
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
enough
of
that
sort
of
publicity
,
and
be
unwilling
to
be
show
up
a
second
time
either
as
a
monster
or
as
a
martyr
.
<EOS>
He
gently
remark
that
he
hope
the
newspaper
would
not
get
hold
of
his
name
again
,
and
then
suggest
that
perhaps
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
abandon
his
object
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
get
old
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
after
all
I
doubt
whether
I
be
fit
to
undertake
new
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
new
duty
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
archdeacon
;
"
do
not
I
tell
you
there
shall
be
no
new
duty
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
perhaps
old
duty
either
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
;
"
I
think
I
will
remain
content
as
I
be
.
"
<EOS>
the
picture
of
Mr.
Slope
cart
away
the
rubbish
be
still
present
to
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
drink
off
his
glass
of
claret
and
prepare
himself
to
be
energetic
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
hope
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
be
not
go
to
be
so
weak
as
to
allow
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Slope
to
deter
you
from
do
what
you
know
it
be
your
duty
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
be
your
duty
to
resume
your
place
at
the
hospital
now
that
parliament
have
so
settle
the
stipend
as
to
remove
those
difficulty
which
induce
you
to
resign
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
deny
this
,
and
should
your
timidity
now
prevent
you
from
do
so
,
your
conscience
will
hereafter
never
forgive
you

"
and
as
he
finish
this
clause
of
his
speech
,
he
push
over
the
bottle
to
his
companion

<EOS>
"
Your
conscience
will
never
forgive
you

he
continue

<EOS>
"
You
resign
the
place
from
conscientious
scruple

scruple
which
I
greatly
respect

though
I
do
not

them

<EOS>
all
your
friend
respect
them

and
you
leave
your
old
house
as
rich
in
reputation
as
you
be
ruin
in
fortune

<EOS>
It
be
now
expect
that
you
will
return
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
be
say
only
the
other
day
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
Gwynne
do
not
reflect
how
much
old
a
man
I
be
now
than
when
he
last
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
old
 
nonsense
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
;
"
you
never
think
yourself
old
till
you
listen
to
the
impudent
trash
of
that
coxcomb
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
sixty
-
five
if
I
live
till
November
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
seventy
-
five
,
if
you
live
till
November
ten
year
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
and
you
bid
fair
to
be
as
efficient
then
as
you
be
ten
year
ago
.
<EOS>
but
for
heaven
's
sake
let
us
have
no
pretence
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Your
plea
of
old
age
be
a
pretence
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
not
drink
your
wine
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
pretence
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
you
be
half
-
afraid
of
this
slope
,
and
would
rather
subject
yourself
to
comparative
poverty
and
discomfort
than
come
to
blow
with
a
man
who
will
trample
on
you
,
if
you
let
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
not
like
come
to
blow
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
I
neither
 
<EOS>
but
sometimes
we
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
this
man
's
object
be
to
induce
you
to
refuse
the
hospital
,
that
he
may
put
some
creature
of
his
own
into
it
;
that
he
may
show
his
power
and
insult
us
all
by
insult
you
,
whose
cause
and
character
be
so
intimately
bind
up
with
that
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
us
all
to
resist
him
in
this
,
even
if
you
have
no
solicitude
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
surely
,
for
your
own
sake
,
you
will
not
be
so
lily
-
livere
as
to
fall
into
this
trap
which
he
have
bait
for
you
and
let
him
take
the
very
bread
out
of
your
mouth
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
do
not
like
be
call
lily
-
livere
,
and
be
rather
inclined
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
there
be
any
true
courage
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
squabble
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
honest
man
do
not
squabble
for
money
,
in
this
wicked
world
of
our
,
the
dishonest
man
would
get
it
all
,
and
I
do
not
see
that
the
cause
of
virtue
would
be
much
improve
.
<EOS>
no
 
we
must
use
the
mean
which
we
have
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
carry
your
argument
home
,
we
may
give
away
every
shilling
of
revenue
which
the
church
have
,
and
I
presume
you
be
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
church
would
be
strengthen
by
such
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
fill
his
glass
and
then
empty
it
,
drink
with
much
reverence
a
silent
toast
to
the
well
-
being
and
permanent
security
of
those
temporality
which
be
so
dear
to
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
all
quarrel
between
a
clergyman
and
his
bishop
should
be
avoid
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
but
it
be
quite
as
much
the
duty
of
the
bishop
to
look
to
that
as
of
his
inferior
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
my
friend
;
I
will
see
the
bishop
in
this
matter
 
that
is
,
if
you
will
allow
me
 
and
you
may
be
sure
I
will
not
compromise
you
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
that
all
this
trash
about
the
Sunday
-
school
and
the
sermon
have
originate
wholly
with
Slope
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
that
the
bishop
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
can
not
very
well
refuse
to
see
me
,
and
I
will
come
upon
him
when
he
have
neither
his
wife
nor
his
chaplain
by
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
find
that
it
will
end
in
his
send
you
the
appointment
without
any
condition
whatever
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
seat
in
the
cathedral
,
we
may
safely
leave
that
to
Mr.
Dean
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
fool
positively
think
that
the
bishop
could
walk
away
with
the
cathedral
if
he
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
matter
be
arrange
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
come
expressly
for
advice
,
and
therefore
feel
himself
bind
to
take
the
advice
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
,
moreover
,
beforehand
that
the
archdeacon
would
not
hear
of
his
give
the
matter
up
,
and
accordingly
,
though
he
have
in
perfect
good
faith
put
forward
his
own
view
,
he
be
prepared
to
yield
.
  
<EOS>
They
therefore
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
in
good
humour
with
each
other
,
and
the
evening
pass
pleasantly
in
prophetic
discussion
on
the
future
war
of
Arabin
and
Slope
.
<EOS>
the
frog
and
the
mouse
would
be
nothing
to
them
,
nor
the
anger
of
Agamemnon
and
Achilles
.
<EOS>
how
the
archdeacon
rub
his
hand
and
plume
himself
on
the
success
of
his
last
move
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
himself
descend
into
the
arena
with
Slope
,
but
Arabin
would
have
no
such
scruple
.
<EOS>
Arabin
be
exactly
the
man
for
such
work
,
and
the
only
man
whom
he
know
that
be
fit
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
good
humour
and
high
buoyancy
continue
till
,
when
recline
on
his
pillow
,
Mrs.
Grantly
commence
to
give
him
her
view
of
the
state
of
affair
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
and
then
certainly
he
be
startle
.
<EOS>
the
last
word
he
say
that
night
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
do
,
by
heaven
I
will
never
speak
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
She
drag
me
into
the
mire
once
,
but
I
will
not
pollute
myself
with
such
filth
as
that
 
"
<EOS>
and
the
archdeacon
give
a
shudder
which
shake
the
whole
room
,
so
violently
be
he
convulse
with
the
thought
which
then
agitate
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
now
in
this
matter
the
widow
Bold
be
scandalously
ill
-
treat
by
her
relative
.
<EOS>
She
have
speak
to
the
man
three
or
four
time
,
and
have
express
her
willingness
to
teach
in
a
Sunday
-
school
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
full
extent
of
her
sin
in
the
matter
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
but
time
will
show
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
Mr.
Harding
return
to
Barchester
,
no
further
word
have
be
speak
in
his
hearing
respect
Mr.
Slope
's
acquaintance
with
his
young
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
he
observe
that
the
archdeacon
at
breakfast
be
less
cordial
than
he
have
be
on
the
precede
evening
.
   
<EOS>
the
Widow
's
suitor
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
lose
no
time
in
avail
himself
of
the
bishop
's
permission
to
see
Mr.
Quiverful
,
and
it
be
in
his
interview
with
this
worthy
pastor
that
he
first
learn
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
worth
the
wooing
.
<EOS>
He
ride
out
to
Puddingdale
to
communicate
to
the
embryo
warden
the
goodwill
of
the
bishop
in
his
favour
,
and
during
the
discussion
on
the
matter
it
be
not
unnatural
that
the
pecuniary
resource
of
Mr.
Harding
and
his
family
should
become
the
subject
of
remark
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
,
with
his
fourteen
child
and
his
four
hundred
a
year
,
be
a
very
poor
man
,
and
the
prospect
of
this
new
preferment
,
which
be
to
be
hold
together
with
his
living
,
be
very
grateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
what
clergyman
so
circumstance
would
not
such
a
prospect
be
very
grateful
?
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Quiverful
have
long
be
acquaint
with
Mr.
Harding
,
and
have
receive
kindness
at
his
hand
,
so
that
his
heart
misgave
him
as
he
think
of
supplant
a
friend
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
extremely
civil
,
cringingly
civil
,
to
Mr.
Slope
;
treat
him
quite
as
the
great
man
;
entreat
this
great
man
to
do
him
the
honour
to
drink
a
glass
of
sherry
,
at
which
,
as
it
be
very
poor
Marsala
,
the
now
pamper
Slope
turn
up
his
nose
;
and
end
by
declare
his
extreme
obligation
to
the
bishop
and
Mr.
Slope
and
his
great
desire
to
accept
the
hospital
,
if
 
if
it
be
certainly
the
case
that
Mr.
Harding
have
refuse
it
.
  
<EOS>
what
man
as
needy
as
Mr.
Quiverful
would
have
be
more
disintereste
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Harding
do
positively
refuse
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
with
a
certain
air
of
offend
dignity
,
"
when
he
hear
of
the
condition
to
which
the
appointment
be
now
subject
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
understand
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
that
the
same
condition
will
be
impose
on
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
care
nothing
for
the
condition
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
undertake
to
preach
any
number
of
sermon
Mr.
Slope
may
have
choose
to
dictate
,
and
to
pass
every
remain
hour
of
his
Sundays
within
the
wall
of
a
Sunday
-
school
.
<EOS>
what
sacrifice
,
or
at
any
rate
,
what
promise
would
have
be
too
much
to
make
for
such
an
addition
to
his
income
,
and
for
such
a
house
!
<EOS>
but
his
mind
still
recur
to
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
say
he
;
"
Mr.
Harding
's
daughter
be
very
rich
,
and
why
should
he
trouble
himself
with
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
Mrs.
Grantly
,
"
say
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
his
widow
daughter
,
"
say
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
have
twelve
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
,
and
I
suppose
Mr.
Harding
mean
to
live
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
twelve
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
!
"
say
Slope
,
and
very
shortly
afterwards
take
his
leave
,
avoid
,
as
far
as
it
be
possible
for
him
to
do
,
any
further
allusion
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
twelve
hundred
a
year
!
"
say
he
to
himself
as
he
ride
slowly
home
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Bold
have
twelve
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
,
what
a
fool
would
he
be
to
oppose
her
father
's
return
to
his
old
place
.
<EOS>
the
train
of
Mr.
Slope
's
idea
will
probably
be
plain
to
all
my
reader
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
not
make
the
twelve
hundred
a
year
his
own
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
so
,
would
it
not
be
well
for
him
to
have
a
father
-
in
-
law
comfortably
provide
with
the
good
thing
of
this
world
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
,
moreover
,
be
much
more
easy
for
him
to
gain
the
daughter
if
he
do
all
in
his
power
to
forward
the
father
's
view
?
  
<EOS>
these
question
present
themselves
to
him
in
a
very
forcible
way
,
and
yet
there
be
many
point
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
if
he
resolve
to
restore
to
Mr.
Harding
his
former
place
,
he
must
take
the
necessary
step
for
do
so
at
once
;
he
must
immediately
talk
over
the
bishop
,
quarrel
on
the
matter
with
Mrs.
Proudie
,
whom
he
know
he
could
not
talk
over
,
and
let
Mr.
Quiverful
know
that
he
have
be
a
little
too
precipitate
as
to
Mr.
Harding
's
positive
refusal
.
<EOS>
that
he
could
effect
all
this
he
do
not
doubt
,
but
he
do
not
wish
to
effect
it
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
wish
to
give
way
to
Mr.
Harding
and
then
be
reject
by
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
wish
to
lose
one
influential
friend
before
he
have
gain
another
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
he
ride
home
,
meditate
many
thing
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
him
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
sister
-
in
-
law
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
that
not
even
for
twelve
hundred
a
year
would
he
submit
to
that
imperious
man
.
<EOS>
a
rich
wife
be
a
great
desideratum
to
him
,
but
success
in
his
profession
be
still
great
;
there
be
,
moreover
,
other
rich
woman
who
may
be
willing
to
become
wife
;
and
after
all
,
this
twelve
hundred
a
year
may
,
when
inquire
into
,
melt
away
into
some
small
sum
utterly
beneath
his
notice
.
<EOS>
then
also
he
remember
that
Mrs.
Bold
have
a
son
.
  
<EOS>
another
circumstance
also
much
influence
him
,
though
it
be
one
which
may
almost
be
say
to
have
influence
him
against
his
will
.
<EOS>
the
vision
of
the
Signora
Neroni
be
perpetually
before
his
eye
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
Mr.
Slope
be
lose
in
love
,
but
yet
he
think
,
and
keep
continually
think
,
that
he
have
never
see
so
beautiful
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
whose
nature
be
open
to
such
impulse
,
and
the
wile
of
the
italianize
charmer
have
be
thoroughly
successful
in
impose
upon
his
thought
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
talk
about
his
heart
:
not
that
he
have
no
heart
,
but
because
his
heart
have
little
to
do
with
his
present
feeling
.
<EOS>
His
taste
have
be
please
,
his
eye
charm
,
and
his
vanity
gratify
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
dazzle
by
a
sort
of
loveliness
which
he
have
never
before
see
,
and
have
be
catch
by
an
easy
,
free
,
voluptuous
manner
which
be
perfectly
new
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
so
tempt
before
,
and
the
temptation
be
now
irresistible
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
own
to
himself
that
he
care
for
this
woman
more
than
for
other
around
him
,
but
yet
he
think
often
of
the
time
when
he
may
see
her
next
,
and
make
,
almost
unconsciously
,
little
cunning
plan
for
see
her
frequently
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
call
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
the
day
after
the
bishop
's
party
,
and
then
the
warmth
of
his
admiration
have
be
feed
with
fresh
fuel
.
<EOS>
if
the
signora
have
be
kind
in
her
manner
and
flattering
in
her
speech
when
lie
upon
the
bishop
's
sofa
,
with
the
eye
of
so
many
on
her
,
she
have
be
much
more
so
in
her
mother
's
drawing
-
room
,
with
no
one
present
but
her
sister
to
repress
either
her
nature
or
her
art
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
thus
leave
her
quite
bewilder
,
and
could
not
willingly
admit
into
his
brain
any
scheme
a
part
of
which
would
be
the
necessity
of
his
abandon
all
further
special
friendship
with
this
lady
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
slowly
ride
along
,
very
meditative
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
the
author
must
beg
it
to
be
remember
that
Mr.
Slope
be
not
in
all
thing
a
bad
man
.
<EOS>
His
motive
,
like
those
of
most
man
,
be
mixed
,
and
though
his
conduct
be
generally
very
different
from
that
which
we
would
wish
to
praise
,
it
be
actuate
perhaps
as
often
as
that
of
the
majority
of
the
world
by
a
desire
to
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
He
believe
in
the
religion
which
he
teach
,
harsh
,
unpalatable
,
uncharitable
as
that
religion
be
.
<EOS>
He
believe
those
whom
he
wish
to
get
under
his
hoof
,
the
Grantlys
and
Gwynnes
of
the
church
,
to
be
the
enemy
of
that
religion
.
<EOS>
He
believe
himself
to
be
a
pillar
of
strength
,
destine
to
do
great
thing
,
and
with
that
subtle
,
selfish
,
ambiguous
sophistry
to
which
the
mind
of
all
man
be
so
subject
,
he
have
teach
himself
to
think
that
in
do
much
for
the
promotion
of
his
own
interest
,
he
be
do
much
also
for
the
promotion
of
religion
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
have
never
be
an
immoral
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
resist
temptation
to
immorality
with
a
strength
of
purpose
that
be
creditable
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
early
in
life
devote
himself
to
work
which
be
not
compatible
with
the
ordinary
pleasure
of
youth
,
and
he
have
abandon
such
pleasure
not
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
must
therefore
be
conceive
that
he
do
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
warmly
admire
the
beauty
of
a
married
woman
without
heart
-
feel
sting
of
conscience
;
and
to
pacify
that
conscience
he
have
to
teach
himself
that
the
nature
of
his
admiration
be
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
he
ride
along
meditative
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
his
choose
the
widow
and
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
that
he
look
upon
as
a
godly
work
rather
than
otherwise
;
as
a
deed
which
,
if
carry
through
,
would
redound
to
his
credit
as
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
on
that
side
lie
no
future
remorse
,
no
conduct
which
he
may
probably
have
to
forget
,
no
inward
sting
.
<EOS>
if
it
should
turn
out
to
be
really
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Bold
have
twelve
hundred
a
year
at
her
own
disposal
,
Mr.
Slope
would
rather
look
upon
it
as
a
duty
which
he
owe
his
religion
to
make
himself
the
master
of
the
wife
and
the
money
;
as
a
duty
too
,
in
which
some
amount
of
self
-
sacrifice
would
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
to
give
up
his
friendship
with
the
signora
,
his
resistance
to
Mr.
Harding
,
his
antipathy
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
find
on
mature
self
-
examination
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
give
up
his
antipathy
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
would
marry
the
lady
as
the
enemy
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
if
such
an
arrangement
suit
her
;
if
not
,
she
must
look
elsewhere
for
a
husband
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
such
resolve
as
this
that
he
reach
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
would
at
once
ascertain
what
the
truth
may
be
as
to
the
lady
's
wealth
,
and
have
do
this
he
would
be
rule
by
circumstance
in
his
conduct
respect
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
if
he
find
that
he
could
turn
round
and
secure
the
place
for
Mr.
Harding
without
much
self
-
sacrifice
,
he
would
do
so
;
but
if
not
,
he
would
woo
the
daughter
in
opposition
to
the
father
.
<EOS>
but
in
no
case
would
he
succumb
to
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
his
horse
take
round
to
the
stable
,
and
immediately
go
forth
to
commence
his
inquiry
.
<EOS>
to
give
Mr.
Slope
his
due
,
he
be
not
a
man
who
ever
let
much
grass
grow
under
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
She
be
doom
to
be
the
intended
victim
of
more
scheme
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
time
that
Mr.
Slope
be
visit
the
vicar
of
Puddingdale
,
a
discussion
take
place
respect
her
charm
and
wealth
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
in
the
close
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
morning
caller
there
,
and
people
have
tell
some
truth
and
also
some
falsehood
respect
the
property
which
John
Bold
have
leave
behind
him
.
<EOS>
by
degree
the
visitor
go
,
and
as
the
doctor
go
with
them
,
and
as
the
doctor
's
wife
have
not
make
her
appearance
,
Charlotte
Stanhope
and
her
brother
be
leave
together
.
<EOS>
He
be
sit
idly
at
the
table
,
scrawl
caricature
of
Barchester
notable
,
then
yawn
,
then
turn
over
a
book
or
two
,
and
evidently
at
a
loss
how
to
kill
his
time
without
much
labour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
do
much
,
Bertie
,
about

any
order

his

"
order

who
on

there
at
Barchester
to

it
worth
his
while
to
have
his

it
the
little

I
would
go
on
with
my
profession
at
once
,
as
you
call
it
,
if
the
governor
would
set
me
up
with
a

in
London

as
to
sculpture
at
Barchester
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
half
the
people
here
do
not

mean

<EOS>

the

will
not

you
in
London

say
Lotte

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
can
not
give
you
what
would
be
sufficient

for
he
have
not
get
it

but
you
may
start
yourself
very
well

you

<EOS>
"
how
the
deuce
be
I
to
do
it

he

<EOS>
"
to

you
will
never

<EOS>
"
that

<EOS>
some

they

it

other
can
not
put
two
shilling
together

but
they
have
a
great
talent
for
all
sort

how

you

I
suppose
I
must
regard
myself

It
be
very
hard
in

England

for
a
young

to
set
herself
in
opposition
to
prejudice
of
that
sort
,
"
say
the
prudent
Charlotte

what
you

<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
have
be
so
much
knock
about
the
world
from
his
early
year
that
he
have
not
retain
much
respect
for
the
gravity
of
english
custom
;
but
even
to
his
mind
an
idea
present
itself
that
,
perhaps
in
a
wife
,
true
british
prejudice
would
not
in
the
long
run
be
less
agreeable
than
anglo
-
italian
freedom
from
restraint
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
exactly
say
so
,
but
he
express
the
idea
in
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
if
I
be
to
die
,
and
then
walk
,
I
should
think
that
my
widow
look
better
in
one
of
those
cap
than
any
other
kind
of
head
-
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
and
you
would
fancy
also
that
she
could
do
nothing
well
than
shut
herself
up
and
cry
for
you
,
or
else
<EOS>
burn
herself
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
think
differently
.
<EOS>
She
would
probably
wear
one
of
those
horrid
she
-
helmet
,
because
she
would
want
the
courage
not
to
do
so
;
but
she
would
wear
it
with
a
heart
longing
for
the
time
when
she
may
be
allow
to
throw
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
hate
such
shallow
false
pretence
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
I
would
let
the
world
say
what
it
please
,
and
show
no
grief
if
I
feel
none
 
and
perhaps
not
,
if
I
do
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
wear
a
widow
's
cap
will
not
lessen
her
fortune
,
"
say
Charlotte

<EOS>
"
or
increase
it
,
"
say
Madeline

<EOS>
"
then
why
on
earth
do
she
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Lotte
's
object
be
to
make
her
put
it
off
,
"

Bertie

<EOS>

if
it
be
true

get
twelve
hundred

not

vulgar

I
dare

she
be

have
for

asking

your
really
marry
a

I
mean
very
much
the

thing
 
that
any
man

be
willing

sacrifice
his

get
possession
of
a
pretty

a
fool

face
be
to

have
cheap

your
mawkish
sentimentality

Lotte

<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
in
what
way
husband
and
wife
generally
live
together
;
you
know
how
far
the
warmth
of
conjugal
affection
can
withstand
the
trial
of
a
bad
dinner
,
of
a
rainy
day
,
or
of
the
least
privation
which
poverty
bring
with
it
;
you
know
what
freedom
a
man
claim
for
himself
,
what
slavery
he
would
exact
from
his
wife
if
he
could
!

you
know
also
how
wife
generally
obey
.
<EOS>
marriage
mean
tyranny
on
one
side
and
deceit
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
a
man
be
a
fool
to
sacrifice
his
interest
for
such
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
a
woman
,
too
generally
,
have
no
other
way
of
living

<EOS>

<EOS>

but
Bertie
have
no
other
way
of
living
,
"
say
Charlotte

<EOS>
"
then
,
in
God
's
name

let
him
marry
Mrs.
Bold

"
say
Madeline
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
settle
between
them
.
  
<EOS>

let
the
gentle

hearted

be
under
no
apprehension
whatsoever

It
be
not
destine

Eleanor
shall
marry
Mr.
Slope

Bertie
Stanhope

<EOS>
and
here
perhaps
it
may
be
allow
to
the
novelist
to
explain
his
view
on
a
very
important
point
in
the
art
of
tell
tale

<EOS>
He
venture
to
reprobate
that
system
which
go
so
far
to
violate
all
proper
confidence
between
the
author

maintain
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
third
volume
a
mystery

to
the
fate

their
favourite
personage

<EOS>
nay

more
,

bad
than
this

be

frequently

<EOS>
have
not
often
the
profound
effort
of
genius
be
use
to
baffle
the
aspiration
of
the
reader
,
to
raise
false
hope
and
false
fear
,
and
to
give
rise
to
expectation
which
be
never
to
be
realize

<EOS>
be
not
promise
all
but
make
of
delightful
horror
,
in
lieu
of
which
the
writer
produce
nothing
but
most
commonplace
reality
in
his
final
chapter
?
<EOS>
and
be
there
not
a
species
of
deceit
in
this
to
which
the
honesty
of
the
present
age
should
lend
no
countenance

<EOS>
and
what
can
be
the
worth

that
solicitude

a
peep

can
utterly
dissipate

<EOS>
what
the
value

absolutely
destroy
by

<EOS>
when
we
have
once
learn
what
be
that
picture
before
which
be
hang
Mrs.
Ratcliffe
's
solemn
curtain
,
we
feel
no
further
interest
about
either
the
frame

the
veil

They
be
to
us
merely
a
receptacle
for
old
bone
,
an
inappropriate
coffin
,
which
we
would
wish
to
have
decently
bury
out
of

then
how
grievous

thing
it
be
to
have
the
pleasure

destroy
by

ill

consider
triumph
of

Dear
Kitty

if
you
will
read
my

you
may
defy
the
ill

nature
of
your
sister
.
<EOS>
there
shall
be
no
secret
that
she
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
nay
,
take
the
third
volume
if
you
please
 
<EOS>
learn
from
the
last
page
all
the
result
of
our
troubled
story
,
and
the
story
shall
have
lose
none
of
its
interest
,
if
indeed
there
be
any
interest
in
it
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
Our
doctrine
be
that
the
author
and
the
reader
should
move
along
together
in
full
confidence
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
let
the
personage
of
the
drama
undergo
ever
so
complete
a
comedy
of
error
among
themselves
,
but
let
the
spectator
never
mistake
the
Syracusan
for
the
ephesian
;
otherwise
he
be
one
of
the
dupe
,
and
the
part
of
a
dupe
be
never
dignified
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
the
value
of
this
chapter
<EOS>
have
it
believe
by
a
single
reader
that
my
Eleanor
could
bring
herself
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
,
or
that
she
should
be
sacrifice
to
a
Bertie
Stanhope
.

show
more

have
she
remain

she

<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
immediately
recognize
her
loveliness
and
think
to
himself
that
,
irrespective
of
her
fortune
,
she
would
be
an
inmate
that
a
man
may
well
desire
for
his
house
,
a
partner
for
his
bosom
's
care
very
well
qualified
to
make
care
lie

<EOS>
Eleanor
hurry
out
of
the
room
to
readjust
her
cap
,
mutter
some
unnecessary
apology
about
her
baby
.
<EOS>
and
while
she
be
go
,
we
will
briefly
go
back
and
state
what
have
be
hitherto
the
result
of
Mr.
Slope
's
meditation
on
his
scheme
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
His
inquiry
as
to
the
widow
's
income
have
at
any
rate
be
so
far
successful
as
to
induce
him
to
determine
to
go
on
with
the
speculation
.
<EOS>
as
regard
Mr.
Harding
,
he
have
also
resolve
to
do
what
he
could
without
injury
to
himself
.
<EOS>
to
Mrs.
Proudie
he
determine
not
to
speak
on
the
matter
,
at
least
not
at
present
.
<EOS>
His
object
be
to
instigate
a
little
rebellion
on
the
part
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
such
a
state
of
thing
would
be
advisable
,
not
only
in
respect
to
Messrs.
Harding
and
Quiverful
,
but
also
in
the
affair
of
the
diocese
generally
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
by
no
means
of
opinion
that
Dr.
Proudie
be
fit
to
rule
,
but
he
conscientiously
think
it
wrong
that
his
brother
clergy
should
be
subject
to
petticoat
government
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
make
up
his
mind
to
infuse
a
little
of
his
spirit
into
the
bishop
,
sufficient
to
induce
him
to
oppose
his
wife
,
though
not
enough
to
make
him
altogether
insubordinate
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
therefore
take
an
opportunity
of
again
speak
to
his
lordship
about
the
hospital
,
and
have
endeavour
to
make
it
appear
that
after
all
it
would
be
unwise
to
exclude
Mr.
Harding
from
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
have
a
hard
task
than
he
have
imagine
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
anxious
to
assume
to
herself
as
much
as
possible
of
the
merit
of
patronage
,
have
write
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
request
her
to
call
at
the
palace
,
and
have
then
explain
to
that
matron
,
with
much
mystery
,
condescension
,
and
dignity
,
the
good
that
be
in
store
for
her
and
her
progeny
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs.
Proudie
have
be
so
engage
at
the
very
time
that
Mr.
Slope
have
be
do
the
same
with
the
husband
at
Puddingdale
Vicarage
,
and
have
thus
in
a
measure
commit
herself
.
<EOS>
the
thank
,
the
humility
,
the
gratitude
,
the
surprise
of
Mrs.
Quiverful
have
be
very
overpowering
;
she
have
all
but
embrace
the
knee
of
her
patroness
,
and
have
promise
that
the
prayer
of
fourteen
unprovided
babe
(
so
Mrs.
Quiverful
have
describe
her
own
family
,
the
eld
of
which
be
a
stout
young
woman
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
)
should
be
put
up
to
heaven
morning
and
evening
for
the
munificent
friend
whom
God
have
send
to
them
.
<EOS>
such
incense
as
this
be
not
unplease
to
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
she
make
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
offer
her
general
assistance
to
the
fourteen
unprovided
babe
,
if
,
as
she
have
no
doubt
,
she
should
find
them
worthy
;
express
a
hope
that
the
eld
of
them
would
be
fit
to
undertake
tuition
in
her
Sabbath
-
school
;
and
altogether
make
herself
a
very
great
lady
in
the
estimation
of
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
she
think
it
prudent
to
drop
a
few
word
before
the
bishop
,
let
him
know
that
she
have
acquaint
the
Puddingdale
family
with
their
good
fortune
;
so
that
he
may
perceive
that
he
stand
committed
to
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
the
husband
well
understand
the
ruse
of
his
wife
,
but
he
do
not
resent
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
be
take
the
patronage
out
of
his
hand
;
he
be
resolve
to
put
an
end
to
her
interference
and
reassume
his
power
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
think
this
be
not
the
good
time
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
put
off
the
evil
hour
,
as
many
a
man
in
similar
circumstance
have
do
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
such
have
be
the
case
,
Mr.
Slope
naturally
encounter
a
difficulty
in
talk
over
the
bishop
,
a
difficulty
indeed
which
he
find
could
not
be
overcome
except
at
the
cost
of
a
general
outbreak
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
a
general
outbreak
at
the
present
moment
may
be
good
policy
,
but
it
also
may
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
any
rate
not
a
step
to
be
lightly
take
.
<EOS>
He
begin
by
whisper
to
the
bishop
that
he
fear
that
public
opinion
would
be
against
him
if
Mr.
Harding
do
not
reappear
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
answer
with
some
warmth
that
Mr.
Quiverful
have
be
promise
the
appointment
on
Mr.
Slope
's
advice
.
"
<EOS>
not
promise
?
"
say
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
promise
,
"
reply
the
bishop
,
"
and
Mrs.
Proudie
have
see
Mrs.
Quiverful
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
quite
unexpected
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Slope
,
but
his
presence
of
mind
do
not
fail
him
,
and
he
turn
the
statement
to
his
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
lord
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
shall
all
be
in
scrape
if
the
lady
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
much
in
unison
with
my
lord
's
feeling
to
be
altogether
unpalatable
,
and
yet
such
an
allusion
to
interference
demand
a
rebuke
.
<EOS>
My
lord
be
somewhat
astounded
also
,
though
not
altogether
make
miserable
,
by
find
that
there
be
a
point
of
difference
between
his
wife
and
his
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
interference
,
"
say
the
bishop
mildly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Proudie
hear
that
Mr.
Quiverful
be
to
be
appoint
,
it
be
not
unnatural
that
she
should
wish
to
see
Mrs.
Quiverful
about
the
school
.
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
say
that
I
see
any
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
speak
,
my
lord
,
for
your
own
comfort
,
"
say
Slope
;
"
for
your
own
comfort
and
dignity
in
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
other
motive
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
personal
feeling
go
,
Mrs.
Proudie
be
the
good
friend
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
must
always
remember
that
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
in
my
present
position
,
my
first
duty
be
to
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
of
that
,
Mr.
Slope
;
I
be
quite
sure
of
that
;
"
say
the
bishop
,
mollify
:
"
and
you
really
think
that
Mr.
Harding
should
have
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
word
,
I
be
inclined
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
prepared
to
take
upon
myself
the
blame
of
first
suggest
Mr.
Quiverful
's
name
.
<EOS>
but
since
do
so
,
I
have
find
that
there
be
so
strong
a
feeling
in
the
diocese
in
favour
of
Mr.
Harding
that
I
think
your
lordship
should
give
way
.
<EOS>
I
hear
also
that
Mr.
Harding
have
modify
the
objection
he
first
feel
to
your
lordship
's
proposition
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
what
have
pass
between
Mrs.
Proudie
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
the
circumstance
may
be
a
little
inconvenient
,
but
I
really
do
not
think
that
that
should
weigh
in
a
matter
of
so
much
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
thus
the
poor
bishop
be
leave
in
a
dreadfully
undecided
step
as
to
what
he
should
do
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
however
,
slightly
incline
itself
to
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Harding
,
see
that
by
such
a
step
he
should
have
the
assistance
of
Mr.
Slope
in
oppose
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
affair
at
the
palace
,
when
Mr.
Slope
call
at
Mrs.
Bold
's
house
and
find
her
playing
with
her
baby
.
<EOS>
when
she
run
out
of
the
room
,
Mr.
Slope
begin
praise
the
weather
to
Mary
Bold
,
then
he
praise
the
baby
and
kiss
him
,
and
then
he
praise
the
mother
,
and
then
he
praise
Miss
Bold
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
however
,
be
not
long
before
she
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
apologize
for
call
at
so
very
early
an
hour
,
"
begin
Mr.
Slope
,
"
but
I
be
really
so
anxious
to
speak
to
you
that
I
hope
you
and
Miss
Bold
will
excuse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
mutter
something
in
which
the
word
"
certainly
,
"
and
"
of
course
,
"
and
"
not
early
at
all
,
"
be
just
audible
,
and
then
apologize
for
her
own
appearance
,
declare
,
with
a
smile
,
that
her
baby
be
become
such
a
big
boy
that
he
be
quite
unmanageable
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
great
big
naughty
boy
,
"
say
she
to
the
child
,
"
and
we
must
send
him
away
to
a
great
big
rough
romp
school
,
where
they
have
great
big
rod
and
do
terrible
thing
to
naughty
boy
who
do
not
do
what
their
own
mamma
tell
them
;
"
and
she
then
commence
another
course
of
kissing
,
be
actuate
thereto
by
the
terrible
idea
of
send
her
child
away
which
her
own
imagination
have
depict
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
the
master
do
not

such
beautiful
long
hair
to

"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
take
up
the
joke
and
pay
a
compliment
at
the

time

<EOS>
Eleanor
think
he
may
as
well
have
leave
the
compliment
alone
,
but
she
say
nothing
and
look
nothing
,

me
take
him

Mary

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
clothe
be
nearly
off
his
back
with
his
romping

and
so
say
she
leave
the
room
with
the
child

<EOS>
Miss
Bold
have
hear
Mr.
Slope
say
he
have
something
press
to
say
to
Eleanor
,
and
think
that
she
may
be
_
de
trop
_
,
<EOS>
take
this
opportunity
of
get
herself
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
long
,
Mary
,
"
say
Eleanor
as
Miss
Bold
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
to
have
the
opportunity
of
have
ten
minute
'
conversation
with
you
alone
,
"
begin
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
openly
ask
you
a
plain
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
you
will
give
me
a
plain
and
open
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
either
that
,
or
none
at
all
,
"
say
she
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
question
be
this
,
Mrs.
Bold
:
be
your
father
really
anxious
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
ask
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
will
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
there
be
wheel
within
wheel
,
all
of
which
I
would
explain
to
you
,
only
I
fear
that
there
be
not
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
essentially
necessary
that
I
should
have
an
answer
to
this
question
,
otherwise
I
can
not
know
how
to
advance
your
father
's
wish
;
and
it
be
quite
impossible
that
I
should
ask
himself
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
esteem
your
father
more
than
I
do
,
but
I
doubt
if
this
feeling
be
reciprocal
.
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
be
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
candid
with
you
as
the
only
mean
of
avoid
ultimate
consequence
,
which
may
be
most
injurious
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
I
fear
there
be
a
feeling
 
I
will
not
even
call
it
a
prejudice
 
with
regard
to
myself
in
Barchester
,
which
be
not
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
You
remember
that
sermon
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Slope
,
we
need
not
go
back
to
that
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
one
moment
,
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
may
talk
of
myself
,
but
because
it
be
so
essential
that
you
should
understand
how
matter
stand
.
<EOS>
that
sermon
may
have
be
ill
-
judge
 
<EOS>
it
be
certainly
misunderstood
;
but
I
will
say
nothing
about
that
now
;
only
this
,
that
it
do
give
rise
to
a
feeling
against
myself
which
your
father
share
with
other
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
have
proper
cause
,
but
the
result
be
that
he
be
not
inclined
to
meet
me
on
friendly
term
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
to
yourself
whether
you
do
not
know
this
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
make
no
answer
,
and
Mr.
Slope
,
in
the
eagerness
of
his
address
,
edge
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
the
widow
's
seat
,
unperceived
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
be
so
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
,
"
I
can
not
ask
him
this
question
as
I
can
ask
it
of
you
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
my
delinquency
since
I
come
to
Barchester
you
have
allow
me
to
regard
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
make
a
little
motion
with
her
head
which
be
hardly
confirmatory
,
but
Mr.
Slope
if
he
notice
it
,
do
not
appear
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
to
you
I
can
speak
openly
and
explain
the
feeling
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
this
your
father
would
not
allow
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
the
bishop
have
think
it
right
that
this
matter
of
the
hospital
should
pass
through
my
hand
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
detail
to
get
up
with
which
he
would
not
trouble
himself
,
and
thus
it
have
come
to
pass
that
I
be
force
to
have
an
interview
with
your
father
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
aware
of
that
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
that
interview
Mr.
Harding
leave
the
impression
on
my
mind
that
he
do
not
wish
to
return
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
could
that
be
?
"
say
Eleanor
,
<EOS>
at
last
stir
up
to
forget
the
cold
propriety
of
demeanour
which
she
have
determine
to
maintain
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
give
you
my
word
that
such
be
the
case
,
"
say
he
,
again
get
a
little
nearer
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
be
more
than
that
,
before
my
interview
with
Mr.
Harding
,
certain
person
at
the
palace
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
the
bishop
 
have
tell
me
that
such
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
hardly
believe
it
;
I
own
,
I
think
that
your
father
would
wish
on
every
account
,
for
conscience
"
sake
,
for
the
sake
of
those
old
man
,
for
old
association
and
the
memory
of
dear
day
long
go
by
,
on
every
account
I
think
that
he
would
wish
to
resume
his
duty
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
tell
that
such
be
not
his
wish
,
and
he
certainly
leave
me
with
the
impression
that
I
have
be
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
!
"
say
Eleanor
,
now
sufficiently
rouse
on
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Miss
Bold
's
step
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
;
"
would
it
be
ask
too
great
a
favour
to
beg
you
to
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
can
manage
anything
with
Miss
Bold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
do
not
like
the
word
manage
,
but
still
she
go
out
and
ask
Mary
to
leave
them
alone
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
I
be
so
very
grateful
for
this
confidence
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
leave
your
father
with
this
impression
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
may
say
that
he
make
me
understand
that
he
decline
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
appointment
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
do
not
decline
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
that
he
would
not
agree
 
that
is
,
that
he
do
not
like
the
scheme
about
the
school
and
the
service
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
he
never
say
that
he
wish
to
refuse
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mrs.
Bold
!
"
say
Mr.
Slope
in
a
manner
almost
impassioned
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
for
the
world
say
to
so
good
a
daughter
a
word
against
so
good
a
father
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
,
for
his
sake
,
let
me
show
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stand
at
present
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
a
little
flurried
when
I
tell
him
of
the
bishop
's
wish
about
the
school
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
perhaps
with
the
less
caution
because
you
yourself
have
so
perfectly
agree
with
me
on
the
same
subject
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
put
out
and
speak
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tell
the
bishop
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
I
quite
disagree
with
him
 
and
shall
not
return
to
the
hospital
as
such
condition
be
attach
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
what
he
say
be
to
that
effect
;
indeed
,
his
word
be
,
if
anything
,
strong
than
those
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
repeat
them
to
his
lordship
,
who
say
that
he
could
look
on
them
in
no
other
light
than
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
He
also
have
hear
the
report
that
your
father
do
not
wish
for
the
appointment
,
and
put
all
these
thing
together
,
he
think
he
have
no
choice
but
to
look
for
someone
else
.
<EOS>
He
have
consequently
offer
the
place
to
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
offer
the
place
to
Mr.
Quiverful
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
Eleanor
,
her
eye
suffuse
with
tear
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
Mr.
Slope
,
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
friend
 
not
so
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
prevent
such
be
the
end
of
it
that
I
be
now
here
.
<EOS>
I
may
at
any
rate
presume
that
I
have
get
an
answer
to
my
question
,
and
that
Mr.
Harding
be
desirous
of
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
desirous
of
return
 
of
course
he
be
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
of
course
he
wish
to
have
back
his
house
and
his
income
and
his
place
in
the
world
;
to
have
back
what
he
give
up
with
such
self
-
deny
honesty
,
if
he
can
have
them
without
restraint
on
his
conduct
to
which
at
his
age
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
submit
.
<EOS>
how
can
the
bishop
ask
a
man
of
his
age
to
turn
schoolmaster
to
a
pack
of
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
out
of
the
question
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
laugh
slightly
;
"
of
course
no
such
demand
shall
be
make
on
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
can
at
any
rate
promise
you
that
I
will
not
be
the
medium
of
any
so
absurd
a
requisition
.
<EOS>
We
wish
your
father
to
preach
in
the
hospital
,
as
the
inmate
may
naturally
be
too
old
to
leave
it
,
but
even
that
shall
not
be
insist
on
.
<EOS>
We
wish
also
to
attach
a
Sabbath
-
day
school
to
the
hospital
,
think
that
such
an
establishment
could
not
but
be
useful
under
the
surveillance
of
so
good
a
clergyman
as
Mr.
Harding
,
and
also
under
your
own
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
we
will
not
talk
of
these
thing
now
.
<EOS>
one
thing
be
clear
:
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
annul
this
rash
offer
the
bishop
have
make
to
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
Your
father
would
not
see
Quiverful
,
would
he
?
<EOS>
quiverful
be
an
honourable
man
,
and
would
not
for
a
moment
stand
in
your
father
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
ask
a
man
with
fourteen
child
to
give
up
his
preferment
!
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
he
will
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
say
Slope
,
and
he
again
draw
near
to
Mrs.
Bold
,
so
that
now
they
be
very
close
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
do
not
think
much
about
it
but
instinctively
move
away
a
little
.
<EOS>
how
greatly
would
she
have
increase
the
distance
<EOS>
could
she
have
guess
what
have
be
say
about
her
at
plumstead
!
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
Quiverful
should
supersede
your
father
 
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
be
too
rash
.
<EOS>
an
idea
occur
to
me
which
may
perhaps
,
with
God
's
blessing
,
put
us
right
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
would
you
object
to
see
the
bishop
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
not
my
father
see
him
?
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
before
in
her
life
interfere
in
her
father
's
affair
,
and
then
not
to
much
advantage
.
<EOS>
She
be
old
now
and
feel
that
she
should
take
no
step
in
a
matter
so
vital
to
him
without
his
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
with
a
look
of
sorrow
,
as
though
he
greatly
bewail
the
want
of
charity
in
his
patron
,
"
the
bishop
fancy
that
he
have
cause
of
anger
against
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
fear
an
interview
would
lead
to
further
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
<EOS>
my
father
be
the
mild
,
the
gentle
man
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
,
"
say
Slope
,
"
that
he
have
the
good
of
daughter
.
<EOS>
so
you
would
not
see
the
bishop
?
<EOS>
as
to
get
an
interview
,
I
could
manage
that
for
you
without
the
slight
annoyance
to
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
nothing
,
Mr.
Slope
,
without
consult
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
he
,
"
that
would
be
useless
;
you
would
then
only
be
your
father
's
messenger
.
<EOS>
do
anything
occur
to
yourself
?
<EOS>
something
must
be
do
.
<EOS>
Your
father
shall
not
be
ruin
by
so
ridiculous
a
misunderstanding
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
say
that
nothing
occur
to
her
,
but
that
it
be
very
hard
;
the
tear
come
to
her
eye
and
roll
down
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
would
have
give
much
to
have
have
the
privilege
of
dry
them
,
but
he
have
tact
enough
to
know
that
he
have
still
a
great
deal
to
do
before
he
could
even
hope
for
any
privilege
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
cut
me
to
the
heart
to
see
you
so
grieve
,
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
but
pray
let
me
assure
you
that
your
father
's
interest
shall
not
be
sacrifice
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
protect
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
the
bishop
openly
what
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
will
explain
to
him
that
he
have
hardly
the
right
to
appoint
any
other
than
your
father
,
and
will
show
him
that
if
he
do
so
he
will
be
guilty
of
great
injustice
 
<EOS>
and
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
you
will
have
the
charity
at
any
rate
to
believe
this
of
me
,
that
I
be
truly
anxious
for
your
father
's
welfare
 
for
his
and
for
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
widow
hardly
know
what
answer
to
make
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
aware
that
her
father
would
not
be
at
all
thankful
to
Mr.
Slope
;
she
have
a
strong
wish
to
share
her
father
's
feeling
;
and
yet
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Slope
be
very
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
who
be
generally
so
charitable
to
all
man
,
who
seldom
speak
ill
of
anyone
,
have
warn
her
against
Mr.
Slope
,
and
yet
she
do
not
know
how
to
abstain
from
thank
him
.
<EOS>
what
interest
could
he
have
in
the
matter
but
that
which
he
profess
?
<EOS>
nevertheless
there
be
that
in
his
manner
which
even
she
distrust
.
<EOS>
She
feel
,
she
do
not
know
why
,
that
there
be
something
about
him
which
ought
to
put
her
on
her
guard
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
read
all
this
in
her
hesitating
manner
just
as
plainly
as
though
she
have
open
her
heart
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
talent
of
the
man
that
he
could
so
read
the
inward
feeling
of
woman
with
whom
he
converse
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
Eleanor
be
doubt
him
,
and
that
,
if
she
thank
him
,
she
would
only
do
so
because
she
could
not
help
it
,
but
yet
this
do
not
make
him
angry
or
even
annoy
him
.
<EOS>
Rome
be
not
build
in
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
come
for
thank
,
"
continue
he
,
see
her
hesitation
,
"
and
do
not
want
them
 
at
any
rate
before
they
be
merit
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
do
want
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
that
I
may
make
to
myself
friend
in
this
fold
to
which
it
have
please
God
to
call
me
as
one
of
the
humblest
of
his
shepherd
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
not
do
so
,
my
task
here
must
indeed
be
a
sad
one
.
<EOS>
I
will
at
any
rate
endeavour
to
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
will
soon
make
plenty
of
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
feel
herself
oblige
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
be
nothing
unless
they
be
such
as
will
sympathize
with
my
feeling
;
unless
they
be
such
as
I
can
reverence
and
admire
 
and
love
.
<EOS>
if
the
good
and
pure
turn
away
from
me
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
be
satisfied
with
the
friendship
of
the
less
estimable
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
I
must
live
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
sure
you
will
not
do
that
,
Mr.
Slope
.
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
mean
nothing
,
but
it
suit
him
to
appear
to
think
some
special
allusion
have
be
intend
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
shall
live
alone
,
quite
alone
as
far
as
the
heart
be
concern
,
if
those
with
whom
I
yearn
to
ally
myself
turn
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
this
;
I
have
call
you
my
friend
,
and
I
hope
you
will
not
contradict
me
.
<EOS>
I
trust
the
time
may
come
when
I
may
also
call
your
father
so
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
you
and
your
darling
boy
.
<EOS>
and
tell
your
father
from
me
that
what
can
be
do
for
his
interest
shall
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
take
his
leave
,
press
the
widow
's
hand
rather
more
closely
than
usual
.
<EOS>
circumstance
,
however
,
seem
just
then
to
make
this
intelligible
,
and
the
lady
do
not
feel
call
on
to
resent
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
him
,
"
say
Eleanor
to
Mary
Bold
a
few
minute
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
he
be
a
good
man
or
a
bad
man
 
whether
he
be
true
or
false

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,

Mary
,
"
and
believe
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
whole
,
I
think
I
do
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
believe
that
he
mean
well
 
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
it
be
a
shame
that
we
should
revile
him
and
make
him
miserable
while
he
be
among
us
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
Mary
,
I
fear
Papa
will
be
disappoint
in
the
hospital
.
"
   
<EOS>
who
Shall
be
Cock
of
the
walk
?
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
thing
be
go
somewhat
uneasily
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
the
hint
or
two
which
Mr.
Slope
have
give
be
by
no
means
throw
away
upon
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
feeling
that
if
he
ever
mean
to
oppose
the
now
almost
unendurable
despotism
of
his
wife
,
he
must
lose
no
further
time
in
do
so
;
that
if
he
ever
mean
to
be
himself
master
in
his
own
diocese
,
let
alone
his
own
house
,
he
should
begin
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
to
have
do
so
from
the
day
of
his
consecration
than
now
,
but
easy
now
than
when
Mrs.
Proudie
should
have
succeed
in
thoroughly
master
the
diocesan
detail
.
<EOS>
then
the
proffer
assistance
of
Mr.
Slope
be
a
great
thing
for
him
,
a
most
unexpected
and
invaluable
aid
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
look
on
the
two
as
ally
force
and
have
consider
that
,
as
ally
,
they
be
impregnable
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
believe
that
his
only
chance
of
escape
would
be
by
the
advancement
of
Mr.
Slope
to
some
distant
and
rich
preferment
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
seem
that
one
of
his
enemy
,
certainly
the
least
potent
of
them
,
but
nevertheless
one
very
important
,
be
willing
to
desert
his
own
camp
.
<EOS>
assist
by
Mr.
Slope
what
may
he
not
do
?
<EOS>
He
walk
up
and
down
his
little
study
,
almost
think
that
the
time
may
come
when
he
would
be
able
to
appropriate
to
his
own
use
the
big
room
upstairs
in
which
his
predecessor
have
always
sit
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
revolve
these
thing
in
his
mind
a
note
be
bring
to
him
from
Archdeacon
<EOS>
Grantly
,
in
which
that
divine
beg
his
lordship
to
do
him
the
honour
of
see
him
on
the
morrow
 
<EOS>
would
his
lordship
have
the
kindness
to
name
an
hour
?
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
's
propose
visit
would
have
reference
to
the
reappointment
of
Mr.
Harding
to
the
wardenship
of
Barchester
Hospital
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
read
his
note
be
inform
that
the
archdeacon
's
servant
be
wait
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
here
at
once
a
great
opportunity
offer
itself
to
the
bishop
of
act
on
his
own
responsibility
.
<EOS>
He
bethink
himself
however
of
his
new
ally
and
ring
the
bell
for
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
turn
out
that
Mr.
Slope
be
not
in
the
house
,
and
then
,
greatly
daring
,
the
bishop
with
his
own
unassisted
spirit
write
a
note
to
the
archdeacon
say
that
he
would
see
him
,
and
name
an
hour
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
have
watch
from
his
study
-
window
that
the
messenger
get
safely
off
from
the
premise
with
this
dispatch
,
he
begin
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
<EOS>
what
step
he
should
next
take
.
  
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
he
would
have
to
declare
to
the
archdeacon
either
that
Mr.
Harding
should
have
the
appointment
,
or
that
he
should
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
feel
that
he
could
not
honestly
throw
over
the
quiverful
without
inform
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
he
resolve
at
last
to
brave
the
lioness
in
her
den
and
tell
her
that
circumstance
be
such
that
it
behove
him
to
reappoint
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
feel
that
he
should
at
all
derogate
from
his
new
courage
by
promise
Mrs.
Proudie
that
the
very
first
piece
of
available
preferment
at
his
disposal
should
be
give
to
Quiverful
to
atone
for
the
injury
do
to
him
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
mollify
the
lioness
with
such
a
sop
,
how
happy
would
he
think
his
first
effort
to
have
be
!
  
<EOS>
not
without
many
misgiving
do
he
find
himself
in
Mrs.
Proudie
's
boudoir
.
<EOS>
He
have
at
first
thought
of
send
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
at
all
impossible
that
she
may
choose
to
take
such
a
message
amiss
,
and
then
also
it
may
be
some
protection
to
him
to
have
his
daughter
present
at
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
sit
with
her
account
-
book
before
her
,
nibble
the
end
of
her
pencil
,
evidently
immerse
in
pecuniary
difficulty
,
and
harass
in
mind
by
the
multiplicity
of
palatial
expense
and
the
heavy
cost
of
episcopal
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
be
around
her
.
<EOS>
Olivia
be
read
a
novel
,
Augusta
be
cross
a
note
to
her
bosom
friend
in
Baker
Street
,
and
Netta
be
work
diminutive
coach
wheel
for
the
bottom
of
a
petticoat
.
<EOS>
if
the
bishop
could
get
the
well
of
his
wife
in
her
present
mood
,
he
would
be
a
man
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
may
then
consider
the
victory
his
own
forever
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
in
such
case
the
matter
between
husband
and
wife
stand
much
the
same
as
it
do
between
two
boy
at
the
same
school
,
two
cock
in
the
same
yard
,
or
two
army
on
the
same
continent

<EOS>
the
conqueror
once

generally
the
conqueror
forever
after

<EOS>
the
prestige
of
victory

everything

"
Ahem

<EOS>
Mrs.

put
her

down
carefully
at
the
point
to
which
she
have

her
figure

mark
down
in
her

the
sum
she

then
look
up

sourly
enough

into

"

continue
the

whose
courage

like
Bob

,
have
ooze
out
now
that
he
find
himself
on
the
ground
of
battle

<EOS>
"
what
be
it
about

Bishop

"
ask
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
it

what
about

<EOS>
It

as
she

she
keep
her

sternly

vigorously
fix
on
the
column
of
figure
before
her

<EOS>
"
why

the

<EOS>

a

the

make
all

for
Puddingdale

he
have
speak
to
the
auctioneer
about
sell
his
farm

horse
,
and

and
in
all
respect
consider
the
place
as
his

<EOS>
of

he
must
have
it

"
  
<EOS>
now
,
Bishop

look
well
to
thyself

call
up
all
the
manhood

be

<EOS>
think
how
much
be
at

<EOS>
if

thou

not
true

no

how
can

desert
his

of
gunpowder
expect
faith
in

Thou

<EOS>
some

so
address
him

<EOS>
but
then
there
be
another

there
which
advise
him
differently

remember

Bishop

she
be
a

such
a

thou

a
battle

such
a

the
very
mischief

be
it
not

Nay

we
could
give
something
else
as
good
to
the
quiverful
 
"
  
"
nonsense
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
it
would
be
year
before
you
could
give
them
anything
else
that
could
suit
them
half
as
well
,
and
as
for
the
press
and
the
public
and
all
that
,
remember
there
be
two
way
of
tell
a
story
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Harding
be
fool
enough
to
tell
his
tale
,
we
can
also
tell
ours
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
offer
to
him
,
and
he
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
now
be
give
to
someone
else
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
at
least
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
rather
believe
you
be
right
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
and
sneak
out
of
the
room
<EOS>
,
he
go
downstairs
,
trouble
in
his
mind
as
to
how
he
should
receive
the
archdeacon
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
not
very
well
just
at
present
,
and
begin
to
consider
that
he
may
,
not
improbably
,
be
detain
in
his
room
the
next
morning
by
an
attack
of
bile
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
unfortunately
,
very
subject
to
bilious
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
will
slope
him
,
"
say
the
indignant
matron
to
her
listening
progeny
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
have
come
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
think
he
be
to
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
himself
,
because
I
have
take
him
by
the
hand
and
get
your
father
to
make
him
his
domestic
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
full
of
impudence
,
"
say
Olivia
;
"
I
tell
you
<EOS>
so
once
before
,
Mamma
.
<EOS>
"
Olivia
,
however
,
have
not
think
him
too
impudent
when
once
before
he
have
propose
to
make
her
Mrs.
Slope

<EOS>
"
well
,
Olivia
,
I
always
think
you
like
him
,
"

Augusta
,
who
at
that
moment
have
some
grudge
against
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
dislike
the
man
,
because
I
think
him
thoroughly
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
you
be
wrong
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
he
be
not
vulgar
at
all
;
and
what
be
more
,
he
be
a
soul
-
stir
,
eloquent
preacher
;
but
he
must
be
teach
to
know
his
place
if
he
be
to
remain
in

house

<EOS>
"
He
have
the
horrid
eye
I
ever
see
in
a
man
's
head
,
"

Netta
;
"
and
I
tell
you
what
,
he
be
terribly
greedy
;
do
you
see
all
the
currant
pie
he
eat
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Slope
get
home
he
soon
learn
from
the
bishop
,
as
much
from
his
manner
as
his
word
,
that
Mrs.
Proudie
's
behest
in
the
matter
of
the
hospital
be
to
be
obey
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
let
fall
something
as
to
"
this
occasion
only
"
and
"
keep
all
affair
about
patronage
exclusively
in
his
own
hand
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
be
quite
decide
about
Mr.
Harding
;
and
as
Mr.
Slope
do
not
wish
to
have
both
the
prelate
and
the
prelatess
against
him
,
he
do
not
at
present
see
that
he
could
do
anything
but
yield
.
  
<EOS>
He
merely
remark
that
he
would
of
course
carry
out
the
bishop
's
view
and
that
he
be
quite
sure
that
if
the
bishop
trust
to
his
own
judgement
thing
in
the
diocese
would
certainly
be
well
order
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
know
that
if
you
hit
a
nail
on
the
head
often
enough
,
it
will
penetrate
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
sit
alone
in
his
room
on
the
same
evening
when
a
light
knock
be
make
on
his
door
,
and
before
he
could
answer
it
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
,
and
his
patroness
appear
.
<EOS>
He
be
all
smile
in
a
moment
,
but
so
be
not
she
also
.
<EOS>
She
take
,
however
,
the
chair
that
be
offer
to
her
,
and
thus
begin
her
expostulation
:
  
"
Mr.
Slope
,
I
do
not
at
all
approve
your
conduct
the
other
night
with
that
italian
woman
.
<EOS>
anyone
would
have
think
that
you
be
her
lover
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
gracious
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
with
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
she
be
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
more
than
I
know
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
however
she
choose
to
pass
for
such
.
<EOS>
but
married
or
not
married
,
such
attention
as
you
pay
to
her
be
improper
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
that
you
would
wish
to
give
offence
in
my
drawing
-
room
,
Mr.
Slope
,
but
I
owe
it
to
myself
and
my
daughter
to
tell
you
that
I
disapprove
of
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
open
wide
his
huge
protrude
eye
and
stare
out
of
them
with
a
look
of
well
-
feign
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
but
fetch
her
something
to
eat
when
she
say
she
be
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
call
on
her
since
,
"
continue
she
,
look
at
the
culprit
with
the
stern
look
of
a
detective
policeman
in
the
act
of
declare
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
turn
over
in
his
mind
whether
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
tell
this
termagant
at
once
that
he
should
call
on
whom
he
like
and
do
what
he
like
,
but
he
remember
that
his
footing
in
Barchester
be
not
yet
sufficiently
firm
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
pacify
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
call
since
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
,
and
certainly
see
Madame
Neroni
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
you
see
her
alone
,
"
say
the
episcopal
Argus
.
  
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
I
do
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
"
but
that
be
because
nobody
else
happen
to
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
surely
it
be
no
fault
of
mine
if
the
rest
of
the
family
be
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
,
but
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
you
will
fall
greatly
in
my
estimation
if
I
find
that
you
allow
yourself
to
be
catch
by
the
lur
of
that
woman
.
<EOS>
I
know
woman
better
than
you
do
,
Mr.
Slope
,
and
you
may
believe
me
that
that
signora
,
as
she
call
herself
,
be
not
a
fitting
companion
for
a
strict
evangelical
unmarried
young
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
Mr.
Slope
would
have
like
to
laugh
at
her
,
have
he
dare
!
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
dare
.
<EOS>
so
he
merely
say
,
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
the
lady
in
question
be
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
hope
not
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
consider
it
my
duty
to
give
you
this
caution
.
<EOS>
and
now
there
be
another
thing
I
feel
myself
call
on
to
speak
about
:
it
be
your
conduct
to
the
bishop
,
Mr.
Slope
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
conduct
to
the
bishop
,
"
say
he
,
now
truly
surprised
and
ignorant
what
the
lady
allude
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr.
Slope
,
your
conduct
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
mean
what
I
would
wish
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
the
bishop
say
anything
,
Mrs.
Proudie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
the
bishop
have
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
probably
think
that
any
remark
on
the
matter
will
come
better
from
me
,
who
first
introduce
you
to
his
lordship
's
notice
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
Mr.
Slope
,
you
be
a
little
inclined
to
take
too
much
upon
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
an
angry
spot
show
itself
on
Mr.
Slope
's
cheek
,
and
it
be
with
difficulty
that
he
control
himself
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
do
so
,
and
sit
quite
silent
while
the
lady
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
fault
of
many
young
man
in
your
position
,
and
therefore
the
bishop
be
not
incline
at
present
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
no
doubt
,
soon
learn
what
be
require
from
you
and
what
be
not
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
however
,
you
will
be
careful
not
to
obtrude
advice
upon
the
bishop
in
any
matter
touch
patronage
.
<EOS>
if
his
lordship
want
advice
,
he
know
where
to
look
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
have
add
to
her
counsel
a
string
of
platitude
as
to
what
be
desirable
and
what
not
desirable
in
the
conduct
of
a
strictly
evangelical
unmarried
young
clergyman
,
Mrs.
Proudie
retreat
,
leave
the
chaplain
to
his
thought
.
  
<EOS>
the
upshot
of
his
thought
be
this
,
that
there
certainly
be
not
room
in
the
diocese
for
the
energy
of
both
himself
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
that
it
behove
him
quickly
to
ascertain
whether
his
energy
or
her
be
to
prevail
.
   
<EOS>
the
Widow
's
persecution
 
early
on
the
follow
morning
Mr.
Slope
be
summon
to
the
bishop
's
dressing
-
room
,
and
go
there
fully
expect
that
he
should
find
his
lordship
very
indignant
and
spirit
up
by
his
wife
to
repeat
the
rebuke
which
she
have
administer
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
resolve
that
at
any
rate
from
him
he
would
not
stand
it
,
and
enter
the
dressing
-
room
in
rather
a
combative
disposition
;
but
he
find
the
bishop
in
the
most
placid
and
gentle
of
humour
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
complain
of
be
rather
unwell
,
have
a
slight
headache
,
and
be
not
quite
the
thing
in
his
stomach
;
but
there
be
nothing
the
matter
with
his
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Slope
,
"
say
he
,
take
the
chaplain
's
proffer
hand
,
"
Archdeacon
Grantly
be
to
call
on
me
this
morning
,
and
I
really
be
not
fit
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
trouble
you
to
see
him
for
me
;
"
and
then
Dr.
Proudie
proceed
to
explain
what
it
be
that
must
be
say
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
tell
in
fact
,
in
the
civil
word
in
which
the
tiding
could
be
convey
,
that
Mr.
Harding
have
refuse
the
wardenship
,
the
appointment
have
be
offer
to
Mr.
Quiverful
and
accept
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
point
out
to
his
patron
that
he
think
he
be
perhaps
not
quite
wise
in
his
decision
,
and
this
<EOS>
he
do
_
sotto
<EOS>
voce
_
.
<EOS>
but
even
with
this
precaution
it
be
not
safe
to
say
much
,
and
during
the
little
that
he
do
say
,
the
bishop
make
a
very
slight
,
but
still
a
very
ominous
gesture
with
his
thumb
towards
the
door
which
open
from
his
dressing
-
room
to
some
inner
sanctuary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
at
once
take
the
hint
and
say
no
more
,
but
he
perceive
that
there
be
to
be
confidence
between
him
and
his
patron
,
that
the
league
desire
by
him
be
to
be
make
,
and
that
this
appointment
of
Mr.
Quiverful
be
to
be
the
last
sacrifice
offer
on
the
altar
of
conjugal
obedience
.
<EOS>
all
this
Mr.
Slope
read
in
the
slight
motion
of
the
bishop
's
thumb
,
and
he
read
it
correctly
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
parchment
and
seal
,
of
attestation
,
explanation
,
and
profession
.
<EOS>
the
bargain
be
understand
between
them
,
and
Mr.
Slope
give
the
bishop
his
hand
upon
it
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
understand
the
little
extra
squeeze
,
and
an
intelligible
gleam
of
assent
twinkle
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
be
civil
to
the
archdeacon
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
he
out
loud
,
"
but
make
him
quite
understand
that
in
this
matter
Mr.
Harding
have
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
oblige
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
calumny
on
Mrs.
Proudie
to
suggest
that
she
be
sit
in
her
bedroom
with
her
ear
at
the
keyhole
during
this
interview
.
<EOS>
She
have
within
her
a
spirit
of
decorum
which
prevent
her
from
descend
to
such
baseness
.
<EOS>
to
put
her
ear
to
a
keyhole
,
or
to
listen
at
a
chink
,
be
a
trick
for
a
housemaid
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
know
this
,
and
therefore
do
not
do
it
;
but
she
station
herself
as
near
to
the
door
as
she
well
could
,
that
she
may
,
if
possible
,
get
the
advantage
which
the
housemaid
would
have
have
,
without
descend
to
the
housemaid
's
artifice
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
little
,
however
,
that
she
hear
,
and
that
little
be
only
sufficient
to
deceive
her
.
<EOS>
She
see
nothing
of
that
friendly
pressure
,
perceive
nothing
of
that
conclude
bargain
;
she
do
not
even
dream
of
the
treacherous
resolve
which
those
two
false
man
have
make
together
to
upset
her
in
the
pride
of
her
station
,
to
dash
the
cup
from
her
lip
before
she
have
drunk
of
it
,
to
sweep
away
all
her
power
before
she
have
taste
its
sweet
!
<EOS>
traitor
that
they
be
,
the
husband
of
her
bosom
and
the
outcast
whom
she
have
foster
and
bring
to
the
warmth
of
the
world
's
bright
fireside
!
<EOS>
but
neither
of
them
have
the
magnanimity
of
this
woman
.
<EOS>
though
two
man
have
thus
league
themselves
together
against
her
,
even
yet
the
battle
be
not
lose

<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
feel
pretty
sure
that
Dr.
Grantly
would
decline
the
honour
of
see
him
,
and
such
turn
out
to
be
the
case

<EOS>
the

when
the

be
open

crumple
it
up
in

mutter
something
about
sorrow

take

He

have
by
this

nearly

poor

<EOS>
"
see

the

glaring
at

by
come
in

with
such

that

<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
live
among
gentleman
,
and
do
not
mean
to
be
drag
into
other
company
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
well
know
what
the
archdeacon
mean
,
but
Eleanor
be
as
innocent
as
her
own
baby
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
understand
how
the
archdeacon
could
consider
himself
to
be
drag
into
bad
company
by
condescend
to
speak
to
Mr.
Slope
for
a
few
minute
when
the
interest
of
her
father
may
be
serve
by
his
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
talk
for
a
full
hour
yesterday
to
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
she
with
some
little
assumption
of
dignity
,
"
and
I
do
not
find
myself
lower
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
not
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
allow
me
,
I
shall
judge
for
myself
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
and
I
tell
you
what
,
Eleanor
;
it
will
be
much
well
for
you
if
you
will
allow
yourself
to
be
guide
also
by
the
advice
of
those
who
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
,
you
will
be
apt
to
find
that
you
have
no
friend
leave
who
can
advise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
blush
up
to
the
root
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
but
even
now
she
have
not
the
slight
idea
of
what
be
pass
in
the
archdeacon
's
mind
.
<EOS>
no
thought
of
love
-
making
or
love
-
receiving
have
yet
find
its
way
to
her
heart
since
the
death
of
poor
John
Bold
,
and
if
it
be
possible
that
such
a
thought
should
spring
there
,
the
man
must
be
far
different
from
Mr.
Slope
that
could
give
it
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Eleanor
blush
deeply
,
for
she
feel
she
be
charge
with
improper
conduct
,
and
she
do
so
with
the
more
inward
pain
because
her
father
do
not
instantly
rally
to
her
side
 
<EOS>
that
father
for
whose
sake
and
love
she
have
submit
to
be
the
receptacle
of
Mr.
Slope
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
a
detailed
account
of
all
that
have
pass
to
her
father
,
and
though
he
have
not
absolutely
agree
with
her
about
Mr.
Slope
's
view
touch
the
hospital
,
yet
he
have
say
nothing
to
make
her
think
that
she
have
be
wrong
in
talk
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
far
too
angry
to
humble
herself
before
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
never
accustom
herself
to
be
very
abject
before
him
,
and
they
have
never
be
confidential
ally
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
the
least
understand
what
you
mean
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
accuse
myself
of
do
anything
that
my
friend
should
disapprove
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
call
here
expressly
to
ask
what
Papa
's
wish
be
about
the
hospital
,
and
as
I
believe
he
call
with
friendly
intention
,
I
tell
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
friendly
intention
!
"
sneer
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
greatly
wrong
Mr.
Slope
,
"
continue
Eleanor
,
"
but
I
have
explain
this
to
Papa
already
;
and
as
you
do
not
seem
to
approve
of
what
I
say
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
I
will
with
your
permission
leave
you
and
Papa
together
;
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
walk
slowly
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
make
Mr.
Harding
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
that
the
archdeacon
and
his
wife
have
make
up
their
mind
that
Eleanor
be
go
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
could
not
really
bring
himself
to
think
that
she
would
do
so
,
but
yet
he
could
not
deny
that
circumstance
make
it
appear
that
the
man
's
company
be
not
disagreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
constantly
see
him
,
and
yet
she
receive
visit
from
no
other
unmarried
gentleman
.
<EOS>
She
always
take
his
part
when
his
conduct
be
canvass
,
although
she
be
aware
how
personally
objectionable
he
be
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
Mr.
Harding
feel
that
if
she
should
choose
to
become
Mrs.
Slope
,
he
have
nothing
that
he
could
justly
urge
against
her
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
full
right
to
please
herself
,
and
he
,
as
a
father
,
could
not
say
that
she
would
disgrace
herself
by
marry
a
clergyman
who
stand
so
well
before
the
world
as
Mr.
Slope
do
.
<EOS>
as
for
quarrel
with
his
daughter
on
account
of
such
a
marriage
,
and
separate
himself
from
her
as
the
archdeacon
have
threaten
to
do
,
that
,
with
Mr.
Harding
,
would
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
if
she
should
determine
to
marry
this
man
,
he
must
get
over
his
aversion
as
best
he
could
.
<EOS>
His
Eleanor
,
his
own
old
companion
in
their
old
happy
home
,
must
still
be
the
friend
of
his
bosom
,
the
child
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
let
who
would
cast
her
off
,
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
fate
that
he
should
have
to
sit
in
his
old
age
at
the
same
table
with
that
man
whom
of
all
man
he
dislike
the
most
,
he
would
meet
his
fate
as
best
he
may
.
<EOS>
anything
to
him
would
be
preferable
to
the
loss
of
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
his
feeling
,
he
hardly
know
how
to
take
part
with
Eleanor
against
the
archdeacon
,
or
with
the
archdeacon
against
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
say
that
he
should
never
have
suspect
her
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
he
never
should
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Harding
be
by
no
mean
a
perfect
character
.
<EOS>
in
his
indecision
,
his
weakness
,
his
proneness
to
be
lead
by
other
,
his
want
of
self
-
confidence
,
he
be
very
far
from
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
must
be
remember
that
such
a
marriage
as
that
which
the
archdeacon
contemplate
with
disgust
,
which
we
who
know
Mr.
Slope
so
well
would
regard
with
equal
disgust
,
do
not
appear
so
monstrous
to
Mr.
Harding
because
in
his
charity
he
do
not
hate
the
chaplain
as
the
archdeacon
do
,
and
as
we
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
very
unhappy
when
his
daughter
leave
the
room
,
and
he
have
recourse
to
an
old
trick
of
his
that
be
customary
to
him
in
his
time
of
sadness
.
<EOS>
He
begin
play
some
slow
tune
upon
an
imaginary
violoncello
,
draw
one
hand
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
he
hold
a
bow
in
it
,
and
modulate
the
unreal
chord
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
marry
that
man
as
sure
as
two
and
two
make
four
,
"
say
the
practical
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
I
hope
not
,
"
say
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
she
do
,
what
can
I
say
to
her
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
object
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
right
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Dr.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
right
as
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
my
own
profession
and
,
for
aught
we
know
,
a
good
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
would
by
no
means
assent
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
well
,
however
,
to
argue
the
case
against
Eleanor
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
,
and
so
they
both
walk
forth
and
discuss
the
matter
in
all
its
bearing
under
the
elm
-
tree
of
the
close
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
also
explain
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
what
have
be
the
purport
,
at
any
rate
the
alleged
purport
,
of
Mr.
Slope
's
last
visit
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
state
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
Mr.
Slope
have
any
real
anxiety
such
as
that
he
have
pretend
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
forget
his
demeanour
to
myself
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
"
and
it
be
not
possible
that
his
idea
should
have
change
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
all
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
sly
_
tartuffe
_
!
<EOS>
He
think
to
buy
the
daughter
by
provide
for
the
father
.
<EOS>
He
mean
to
show
how
powerful
he
be
,
how
good
he
be
,
and
how
much
he
be
willing
to
do
for
her
_
beaux
yeux
_
;
yes
,
I
see
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
be
too
many
for
him
yet
,
Mr.
Harding
;
"
he
say
,
turn
to
his
companion
with
some
gravity
and
press
his
hand
upon
the
other
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
,
perhaps
,
be
well
for
you
to
lose
the
hospital
than
get
it
on
such
term
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
lose
it
!
"
say
Mr.
Harding
;
"
why
I
have
lose
it
already
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
do
without
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
withdraw
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
will
just
go
and
write
a
line
to
the
bishop
and
tell
him
that
I
withdraw
my
claim
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
nothing
would
have
please
him
better
than
to
be
allow
to
escape
from
the
trouble
and
difficulty
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
now
go
too
fast
for
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
no
 
no
!
<EOS>
We
will
do
no
such
thing
,
"
say
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
still
have
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
doubt
but
that
we
will
have
it
.
<EOS>
but
not
by
Mr.
Slope
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
if
that
be
necessary
,
we
will
lose
it
;
but
we
will
have
it
,
spite
of
his
tooth
,
if
we
can
.
<EOS>
Arabin
will
be
at
plumstead
to
-
morrow
;
you
must
come
over
and
talk
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
now
turn
into
the
cathedral
library
,
which
be
use
by
the
clergyman
of
the
close
as
a
sort
of
ecclesiastical
club
-
room
,
for
write
sermon
and
sometimes
letter
;
also
for
read
theological
work
and
sometimes
magazine
and
newspaper
.
<EOS>
the
theological
work
be
not
disturb
,
perhaps
,
quite
as
often
as
from
the
appearance
of
the
building
the
outside
public
may
have
be
lead
to
expect
.
<EOS>
here
the
two
ally
settle
on
their
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
write
a
letter
to
the
bishop
,
strongly
word
,
but
still
respectful
,
in
which
he
put
forward
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
claim
to
the
appointment
and
express
his
own
regret
that
he
have
not
be
able
to
see
his
lordship
when
he
call
.
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Slope
he
make
no
mention
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
settle
that
Mr.
Harding
should
go
out
to
Plumstead
on
the
follow
day
,
and
after
considerable
discussion
on
the
matter
the
archdeacon
propose
to
ask
Eleanor
there
also
,
so
as
to
withdraw
her
,
if
possible
,
from
Mr.
Slope
's
attention
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
week
or
two
,
"
say
he
,
"
may
teach
her
what
he
be
,
and
while
she
be
there
she
will
be
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
will
not
come
there
after
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
not
a
little
surprised
when
her
brother
-
in
-
law
come
back
and
very
civilly
press
her
to
go
out
to
Plumstead
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
perceive
that
her
father
have
be
fight
her
battle
for
her
behind
her
back
.
<EOS>
She
feel
thankful
to
him
,
and
for
his
sake
she
would
not
show
her
resentment
to
the
archdeacon
by
refuse
his
invitation
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
,
she
say
,
go
on
the
morrow
;
she
have
an
invitation
to
drink
tea
at
the
Stanhopes
,
which
she
have
promise
to
accept
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
she

"
the
Stanhopes

"
say
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

you
be
so
intimate
with
them

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
it
myself
,
"
say
she
,
"
till
Miss
Stanhope
call
yesterday
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
like
her
very
much
,
and
I
have
promise
to
go
and
play
chess
with
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
they
a
party
there
?
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
still
fearful
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
Miss
Stanhope
say
there
be
to
be
nobody
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
hear
that
Mary
have
leave
me
for
a
few
week
,
and
she
have
learn
from
someone
that
I
play
chess
,
and
so
she
come
over
on
purpose
to
ask
me
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
very
friendly
,
"
say
the
ex
-
warden
.
<EOS>
"
They
certainly
do
look
more
like
foreigner
than
english
people
,
but
I
dare
say
they
be
none
the
bad
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
inclined
to
look
upon
the
stanhope
with
favourable
eye
,
and
have
nothing
to
object
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
arrange
that
Mr.
Harding
should
postpone
his
visit
to
Plumstead
for
one
day
and
then
take
with
him
Eleanor
,
the
baby
,
and
the
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
certainly
become
of
some
importance
in
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
barchester
by
Moonlight
 
<EOS>
there
be
much
cause
for
grief
and
occasional
perturbation
of
spirit
in
the
Stanhope
family
,
but
yet
they
rarely
seem
to
be
grieve
or
to
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
peculiar
gift
of
each
of
them
that
each
be
able
to
bear
his
or
her
own
burden
without
complaint
,
and
perhaps
without
sympathy
.
<EOS>
They
habitually
look
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
wall
,
if
there
be
a
gleam
on
either
side
for
them
to
look
at
;
if
there
be
none
,
they
endure
the
shade
with
an
indifference
which
,
if
not
stoical
,
answer
the
end
at
which
the
Stoics
aim
.
<EOS>
old
Stanhope
could
not
but
feel
that
he
have
ill
-
perform
his
duty
as
a
father
and
a
clergyman
,
and
could
hardly
look
forward
to
his
own
death
without
grief
at
the
position
in
which
he
would
leave
his
family
.
<EOS>
His
income
for
many
year
have
be
as
high
as
£
3,000
a
year
,
and
yet
they
have
among
them
no
other
provision
than
their
mother
's
fortune
of
£
10,000
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
only
spend
his
income
,
but
be
in
debt
.
<EOS>
yet
with
all
this
he
seldom
show
much
outward
sign
of
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
the
mother
.
<EOS>
if
she
add
little
to
the
pleasure
of
her
child
,
she
detract
still
less
:
she
neither
grumble
at
her
lot
,
nor
speak
much
of
her
past
or
future
suffering
;
as
long
as
she
have
a
maid
to
adjust
her
dress
,
and
have
those
dress
well
make
,
nature
with
her
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
the
child
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
never
rebuke
her
father
with
the
prospect
of
their
future
poverty
,
nor
do
it
seem
to
grieve
her
that
she
be
become
an
old
maid
so
quickly
;
her
temper
be
rarely
ruffle
,
and
,
if
we
may
judge
by
her
appearance
,
she
be
always
happy
.
<EOS>
the
signora
be
not
so
sweet
-
tempered
,
but
she
possess
much
endure
courage
;
she
seldom
complain
 
never
,
indeed
,
to
her
family
.
<EOS>
though
she
have
a
cause
for
affliction
which
would
have
utterly
break
down
the
heart
of
most
woman
as
beautiful
as
she
and
as
devoid
of
all
religious
support
,
yet
she
bear
her
suffering
in
silence
,
or
allude
to
it
only
to
elicit
the
sympathy
and
stimulate
the
admiration
of
the
man
with
whom
she
flirt
.
<EOS>
as
to
Bertie
,
one
would
have
imagine
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
gleam
of
his
eye
that
he
have
not
a
sorrow
nor
a
care
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
nor
have
he
.
<EOS>
He
be
incapable
of
anticipate
to
-
morrow
's
griefs
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
future
want
no
more
disturb
his
appetite
<EOS>
than
do
that
of
the
butcher
's
knife
disturb
the
appetite
of
the
sheep
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
usual
tenor
of
their
way
;
but
there
be
rare
exception
.
<EOS>
occasionally
the
father
would
allow
an
angry
glance
to
fall
from
his
eye
,
and
the
lion
would
send
forth
a
low
dangerous
roar
as
though
he
meditate
some
deed
of
blood
.
<EOS>
occasionally
also
Madame
Neroni
would
become
bitter
against
mankind
,
more
than
usually
antagonistic
to
the
world
's
decency
,
and
would
seem
as
though
she
be
about
to
break
from
her
mooring
and
allow
herself
to
be
carry
forth
by
the
tide
of
her
feeling
to
utter
ruin
and
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
like
the
rest
of
them
,
have
no
real
feeling
,
could
feel
no
true
passion
.
<EOS>
in
that
be
her
security
.
<EOS>
before
she
resolve
on
any
contemplate
escapade
she
would
make
a
small
calculation
,
and
generally
sum
up
that
the
Stanhope
villa
or
even
Barchester
close
be
well
than
the
world
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
most
irregular
in
their
hour
.
<EOS>
the
father
be
generally
the
early
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
and
Charlotte
would
soon
follow
and
give
him
his
coffee
,
but
the
other
breakfast
anywhere
,
anyhow
,
and
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
on
the
morning
after
the
archdeacon
's
futile
visit
to
the
palace
,
Dr.
Stanhope
come
downstairs
with
an
ominously
dark
look
about
his
eyebrow
;
his
white
lock
be
rough
than
usual
,
and
he
breathe
thickly
and
loudly
as
he
take
his
seat
in
his
armchair
.
<EOS>
He
have
open
letter
in
his
hand
,
and
when
Charlotte
come
into
the
room
,
he
be
still
read
them
.
<EOS>
She
go
up
and
kiss
him
as
be
her
will
not
,
but
he
hardly
notice
her
as
she
do
so
,
and
she
know
at
once
that
something
be
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
throw
over
the
table
a
letter
with
a
Milan
postmark
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
be
a
little
frightened
as
she
take
it
up
,
but
her
mind
be
relieve
when
she
see
that
it
be
merely
the
bill
of
their
italian
milliner
.
<EOS>
the
sum
total
be
certainly
large
,
but
not
so
large
as
to
create
an
important
row
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
our
clothe
,
Papa
,
for
six
month
before
we
come
here

<EOS>
the
three
of
us
can
not
dress

you
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing

indeed

"
say
he
,
look
at
the
figure
which
,
in
milanese
denomination

be
certainly
monstrous

<EOS>
"
the
man
should
have
send
it
to
me

say
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
have
with
all
my
heart
 
if
you
would
have
pay
it

<EOS>
I
see
enough
in
it
to
know
that
three
quarter
of
it
be
for
Madeline

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
little
else
to
amuse
her

sir

say
Charlotte
with
true
good
nature

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
he
have
nothing
else
to
amuse
him
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
throw
over
another
letter
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
some
member
of
the
family
of
Sidonia
,
and
politely
request
the
father
to
pay
a
small
trifle
of
£
700
,
be
the
amount
of
a
bill
discount
in
favour
of
Mr.
Ethelbert
Stanhope
and
now
overdue
for
a
period
of
nine
month
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
read
the
letter
,
slowly
fold
it
up
,
and
put
it
under
the
edge
of
the
tea
-
tray
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
have
nothing
to
amuse
him
but
discount
bill
with
Jews

<EOS>
do
he
think
I
will
pay
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
think
no
such
thing

say
she

who
do

will
pay
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
honesty
go
I
suppose
it
will
not

matter

she
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
get
very
little
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
not
much
matter
either
,
"
say
the
father
,
"
if
he
go
to
prison
and
rot
there
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
that
be
the
other
alternative

"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
speak
of
the
custom
of
his
youth
.
<EOS>
but
his
daughter
,
though
she
have
live
so
long
abroad
,
be
much
more
completely
verse
in
the
way
of
the
english
world

<EOS>
"
if
the

arrest
him

say
she

he

It

I

bad
come

I
want
you
to

civil

<EOS>
just
at
that
moment
the
door
open

and
Bertie
come
in
whistling
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
immediately
devote
himself
to
his
egg
and
allow
Bertie
to
whistle
himself
round
to
his
sister
's
side
without
notice
him
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
give
a
sign
to
him
with
her
eye
,
first
glance
at
her
father
,
and
then
at
the
letter
,
the
corner
of
which
peep
out
from
under

<EOS>
Bertie
see
and
understand

and
with
the
quiet
motion
of
a
cat
he
abstract
the
letter
and
make
himself
acquaint
with
its
content

<EOS>
the
doctor
,
however

have
see
him
,
deep
as
he
appear
to
be
merse
in
his
egg

shell

and
say
in
his
harsh
voice

<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
I
shall
not

say
the
father
,
and
then
he
add
,
after
a
pause
,
"
be
it
true

sir
,
that
you
owe
the
man
£
700

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

say
Bertie

"
I
think
I

incline

have

your

the

very
loudly

very
angrily

<EOS>
"
well
,
I
believe
he
have

"
say
Bertie
,
"
but
all
the
money
I
ever

£
150

what
become

<EOS>
"
why

sir

the
commission
be
£
100

so

I
take
the

stone

horse

<EOS>
"
pave

<EOS>
"
oh

I
suppose
they
be

London
somewhere

I
will
inquire

<EOS>
"
He
be
an
idiot

say
the
doctor

it
be
sheer
folly
to
waste
more
money

<EOS>
nothing

and
so
say
,
the
unhappy
father
walk
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
the
governor
like
to
have
the
paving

stone

say
Bertie
to
his
sister

<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what

say
she

<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
take
care

you
will
find
yourself
loose
upon

your
head

you
do
not
know
him
as
well
as
I
do

<EOS>
He
be
very
angry

"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
stroke
his
big
beard
,
sip
his
tea
,
chat
over
his
misfortune
in
a
half
-
comic
,
half
-
serious
tone
,
and
end
by
promise
his
sister
that
he
would
do
his
very
good
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
Widow
Bold
.
<EOS>
then
Charlotte
follow
her
father
to
his
own
room
,
soften
down
his
wrath
,
and
persuade
him
to
say
nothing
more
about
the
Jew
bill
discounter
,
at
any
rate
for
a
few
week

<EOS>
He
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
he
would
pay
the
£
700
,
or
at
any
rate
settle
the
bill
,
if
he
see
a
certainty
of
his
son
's
securing
for
himself
anything
like
a
decent
provision
in
life
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
openly
between
them
about
poor
Eleanor
,
but
the
father
and
the
daughter
understand
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
meet
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
nine
o'clock
,
in
perfect
good
humour
with
each
other
,
and
about
that
hour
Mrs.
Bold
be
announce
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
in
the
house
before
,
though
she
have
of
course
call
,
and
now
she
feel
it
strange
to
find
herself
there
in
her
usual
evening
dress
,
enter
the
drawing
-
room
of
these
stranger
in
this
friendly
,
unceremonious
way
,
as
though
she
have
know
them
all
her
life
.
<EOS>
but
in
three
minute
they
make
her
at
home
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
trip
downstairs
and
take
her
bonnet
from
her
,
and
Bertie
come
to
relieve
her
from
her
shawl
,
and
the
signora
smile
on
her
as
she
could
smile
when
she
choose
to
be
gracious
,
and
the
old
doctor
shake
hand
with
her
in
a
kind
benedictory
manner
that
go
to
her
heart
at
once
and
make
her
feel
that
he
must
be
a
good
man
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
seat
for
above
five
minute
when
the
door
again
open
and
Mr.
Slope
be
announce
.
<EOS>
She
feel
rather
surprised
,
because
she
be
tell
that
nobody
be
to
be
there
,
and
it
be
very
evident
from
the
manner
of
some
of
them
that
Mr.
Slope
be
not
unexpected
.
<EOS>
but
still
there
be
not
much
in
it
.
<EOS>
in
such
invitation
a
bachelor
or
two
more
or
less
be
always
speak
of
as
nobody
,
and
there
be
no
reason
why
Mr.
Slope
should
not
drink
tea
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
as
well
as
Eleanor
herself
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
be
very
much
surprised
and
not
very
much
gratify
at
find
that
his
own
embryo
spouse
make
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
there
to
gratify
himself
by
gaze
on
Madame
Neroni
's
beauty
and
listen
to
and
return
her
flattery
:
and
though
he
have
not
own
as
much
to
himself
,
he
still
feel
that
if
he
spend
the
evening
as
he
have
intend
to
do
,
he
may
probably
not
thereby
advance
his
suit
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
the
signora
,
who
have
no
idea
of
a
rival
,
receive
Mr.
Slope
with
her
usual
mark
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
as
he
take
her
hand
,
she
make
some
confidential
communication
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
declare
that
she
have
a
plan
to
communicate
to
him
after
tea
,
and
be
evidently
prepared
to
go
on
with
her
work
of
reduce
the
chaplain
to
a
state
of
captivity
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Slope
be
rather
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
Eleanor
could
not
but
have
learn
from
his
demeanour
that
he
be
an
admirer
of
her
own
,
and
he
have
also
flatter
himself
that
the
idea
be
not
unacceptable
to
her
.
<EOS>
what
would
she
think
of
him
if
he
now
devote
himself
to
a
married
woman
!
  
<EOS>
but
Eleanor
be
not
inclined
to
be
severe
in
her
criticism
on
him
in
this
respect
,
and
feel
no
annoyance
of
any
kind
,
when
she
find
herself
seat
between
Bertie
and
Charlotte
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
suspicion
of
Mr.
Slope
's
intention
;
she
have
no
suspicion
even
of
the
suspicion
of
other
people
;
but
still
she
feel
well
-
pleased
not
to
have
Mr.
Slope
too
near
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
be
not
ill
-
pleased
to
have
Bertie
Stanhope
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
rarely
indeed
that
he
fail
to
make
an
agreeable
impression
on
stranger
.
<EOS>
with
a
bishop
indeed
who
think
much
of
his
own
dignity
it
be
possible
that
he
may
fail
,
but
hardly
with
a
young
and
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
He
possess
the
tact
of
become
instantly
intimate
with
woman
without
give
rise
to
any
fear
of
impertinence
.
<EOS>
He
have
about
him
somewhat
of
the
propensity
of
a
tame
cat
.
<EOS>
It
seem
quite
natural
that
he
should
be
pet
,
caress
,
and
treat
with
familiar
good
nature
,
and
that
in
return
he
should
purr
,
and
be
sleek
and
graceful
,
and
above
all
never
show
his
claws
.
<EOS>
like
other
tame
cat
,
however
,
he
have
his
claws
,
and
sometimes
make
them
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
when
tea
be
over
,
Charlotte
go
to
the
open
window
and
declare
loudly
that
the
full
harvest
moon
be
much
too
beautiful
to
be
disregard
,
and
call
them
all
to
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
there
be
but
one
there
who
care
much
about
the
moon
's
beauty
,
and
that
one
be
not
Charlotte
,
but
she
know
how
valuable
an
aid
to
her
purpose
the
chaste
goddess
may
become
,
and
could
easily
create
a
little
enthusiasm
for
the
purpose
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
and
Bertie
be
soon
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
now
quiet
in
his
armchair
,
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
in
her
,
both
prepare
for
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
a
Whewellite
or
a
Brewsterite
,
or
a
t'othermanite
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
say
Charlotte
,
who
know
a
little
about
everything
,
and
have
read
about
a
third
of
each
of
the
book
to
which
she
allude
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
I
have
not
read
any
of
the
book
,
but
I
feel
sure
that
there
be
one
man
in
the
moon
at
least
,
if
not
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
believe
in
the
pulpy
gelatinous
matter
?
"
say
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
about
that
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
really
think
it
be
almost
wicked
to
talk
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
how
can
we
argue
about
God
's
power
in
the
other
star
from
the
law
which
he
have
give
for
our
rule
in
this
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
indeed
!
"
say
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
not
there
be
a
race
of
salamander
in
Venus
?
<EOS>
and
even
if
there
be
nothing
but
fish
in
Jupiter
,
why
should
not
the
fish
there
be
as
wide
awake
as
the
man
and
woman
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
say
very
little
for
them
,
"
say
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
for
Dr.
Whewell
myself
,
for
I
do
not
think
that
man
and
woman
be
worth
be
repeat
in
such
countless
world
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
soul
in
other
star
,
but
I
doubt
their
have
any
body
attach
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
let
us
put
our
bonnet
on
and
walk
round
the
close
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
discuss
sidereal
question
,
we
shall
do
so
much
better
under
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
than
stuck
in
this
narrow
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
make
no
objection
,
and
a
party
be
make
to
walk
out
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
well
know
the
rule
as
to
three
be
no
company
,
and
she
have
therefore
to
induce
her
sister
to
allow
Mr.
Slope
to
accompany
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
Mr.
Slope
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
be
sure
you
will
join
us
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
in
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
Madeline
.
"
  
<EOS>
Madeline
read
in
her
eye
all
that
she
have
to
say
,
know
her
object
,
and
as
she
have
to
depend
on
her
sister
for
so
many
of
her
amusement
,
she
feel
that
she
must
yield
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
be
leave
alone
while
other
of
her
own
age
walk
out
to
feel
the
soft
influence
of
the
bright
night
,
but
it
would
be
hard
still
to
be
without
the
sort
of
sanction
which
Charlotte
give
to
all
her
flirtation
and
intrigue
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
's
eye
tell
her
that
she
must
give
up
just
at
present
for
the
good
of
the
family
,
and
so
Madeline
obey
.
  
<EOS>
but
Charlotte
's
eye
say
nothing
of
the
sort
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
objection
at
all
to
the
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
the
signora
which
the
departure
of
the
other
three
would
allow
him
,
and
gently
whisper
to
her
,
"
I
shall
not
leave
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
say
she
;
"
go
 
pray
go
,
pray
go
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
do
not
think
that
I
be
so
selfish
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
nobody
be
keep
within
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
this
too
when
you
know
me
better
.
<EOS>
pray
join
them
,
Mr.
Slope
,
but
when
you
come
in
speak
to
me
for
five
minute
before
you
leave
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
understand
that
he
be
to
go
,
and
he
therefore
join
the
party
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
have
no
objection
at
all
to
this
arrangement
,
if
he
could
have
secure
Mrs.
Bold
's
arm
;
but
this
of
course
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
his
fate
be
very
soon
settle
,
for
no
sooner
have
he
reach
the
hall
-
door
than
Miss
Stanhope
put
her
hand
within
his
arm
,
and
Bertie
walk
off
with
Eleanor
just
as
naturally
as
though
she
be
already
his
own
property
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
they
saunter
forth
<EOS>
:
first
they
walk
round
the
close
,
accord
to
their
avow
intent
;
then
they
go
under
the
old
arched
gateway
below
St.
Cuthbert
's
little
church
,
and
then
they
turn
behind
the
ground
of
the
bishop
's
palace
,
and
so
on
till
they
come
to
the
bridge
just
at
the
edge
of
the
town
,
from
which
passer
-
by
can
look
down
into
the
garden
of
Hiram
's
hospital
;
and
here
Charlotte
and
Mr.
Slope
,
who
be
in
advance
,
stop
till
the
other
two
come
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
know
that
the
gable
-
end
and
old
brick
chimney
which
stand
up
so
prettily
in
the
moonlight
be
those
of
Mr.
Harding
's
late
abode
,
and
would
not
have
stop
on
such
a
spot
,
in
such
company
,
if
he
could
have
avoid
it
;
but
Miss
Stanhope
would
not
take
the
hint
which
he
try
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
very
pretty
place
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
say
Charlotte
;
"
by
far
the
pretty
place
near
Barchester
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
your
father
give
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
pretty
place
,
and
now
by
the
deceitful
light
of
the
moon
look
twice
large
,
twice
pretty
,
twice
more
antiquely
picturesque
than
it
would
have
do
in
truth
-
tell
daylight
.
<EOS>
who
do
not
know
the
air
of
complex
multiplicity
and
the
mysterious
interesting
grace
which
the
moon
always
lend
to
old
gable
building
half
-
surround
,
as
be
the
hospital
,
by
fine
tree
!
<EOS>
as
see
from
the
bridge
on
the
night
of
which
we
be
speak
,
Mr.
Harding
's
late
abode
do
look
very
lovely
,
and
though
Eleanor
do
not
grieve
at
her
father
's
have
leave
it
,
she
feel
at
the
moment
an
intense
wish
that
he
may
be
allow
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
go
to
return
to
it
almost
immediately
,
be
he
not
?
"
ask
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
make
no
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
many
such
a
question
pass
unanswere
without
the
notice
of
the
questioner
,
but
such
be
not
now
the
case
.
<EOS>
They
all
remain
silent
as
though
expect
her
to
reply
,
and
after
a
moment
or
two
,
Charlotte
say
,
"
I
believe
it
be
settle
that
Mr.
Harding
return
to
the
hospital
,
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
anything
about
it
be
settle
yet
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
must
be
a
matter
of
course
,
"
say
Bertie
;
"
that
is
,
if
your
father
wish
it
.
<EOS>
who
else
on
earth
could
hold
it
after
what
have
occur
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
quietly
make
her
companion
understand
that
the
matter
be
one
which
she
could
not
discuss
in
the
present
company
,
and
then
they
pass
on
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
say
she
would
go
a
short
way
up
the
hill
out
of
the
town
so
as
to
look
back
upon
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
,
and
as
Eleanor
leant
upon
Bertie
's
arm
for
assistance
in
the
walk
,
she
tell
him
how
the
matter
stand
between
her
father
and
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
he
,
"
say
Bertie
,
point
on
to
Mr.
Slope
,
"
what
part
do
he
take
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
explain
how
Mr.
Slope
have
at
first
endeavour
to
tyrannize
over
her
father
,
but
how
he
have
latterly
come
round
and
do
all
he
could
to
talk
the
bishop
over
in
Mr.
Harding
's
favour
.
"
<EOS>
but
my
father
,
"
she
say
,
"
be
hardly
inclined
to
trust
him
;
they
all
say
he
be
so
arrogant
to
the
old
clergyman
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
my
word
for
it
,
"
say
Bertie
,
"
your
father
be
right
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
very
much
mistaken
,
that
man
be
both
arrogant
and
false
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
stroll
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
return
through
the
field
by
a
foot
-
path
which
lead
by
a
small
wooden
bridge
,
or
rather
a
plank
with
a
rustic
rail
to
it
,
over
the
river
to
the
other
side
of
the
cathedral
from
that
at
which
they
have
start
.
<EOS>
They
have
thus
walk
round
the
bishop
's
ground
,
through
which
the
river
run
,
and
round
the
cathedral
and
adjacent
field
,
and
it
be
past
eleven
before
they
reach
the
doctor
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
late
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
it
will
be
a
shame
to
disturb
your
mother
again
at
such
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
"
"
say
Charlotte
,
laugh
,
"
you
will
not
disturb
Mamma
<EOS>
;
I
dare
say
she
be
in
bed
by
this
time
,
and
Madeline
would
be
furious
if
you
do
not
come
in
and
see
her
.
<EOS>
come
,
Bertie
,
take
Mrs.
Bold
's
bonnet
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
go
upstairs
and
find
the
signora
alone
,
read
.
<EOS>
She
look
somewhat
sad
and
melancholy
,
but
not
more
so
perhaps
than
be
sufficient
to
excite
additional
interest
in

the

produce
all

Mr.
Arabin
 
<EOS>
the
Rev.
Francis
Arabin
,
fellow
of
Lazarus
,
late
professor
of
poetry
at
Oxford
,
and
present
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
,
in
the
diocese
of
Barchester
,
must
now
be
introduce
personally
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
He
be
worthy
of
a
new
volume
,
and
as
he
will
fill
a
conspicuous
place
in
it
,
it
be
desirable
that
he
should
be
make
to
stand
before
the
reader
's
eye
by
the
aid
of
such
portraiture
as
the
author
be
able
to
produce
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
regret
that
no
mental
method
of
daguerreotype
or
photography
have
yet
be
discover
by
which
the
character
of
man
can
be
reduce
to
write
and
put
into
grammatical
language
with
an
unerring
precision
of
truthful
description
.
<EOS>
how
often
do
the
novelist
feel
,
ay
,
and
the
historian
also
and
the
biographer
,
that
he
have
conceive
within
his
mind
and
accurately
depict
on
the
tablet
of
his
brain
the
full
character
and
personage
of
a
man
,
and
that
nevertheless
,
when
he
fly
to
pen
and
ink
to
perpetuate
the
portrait
,
his
word
forsake
,
elude
,
disappoint
,
and
play
the
deuce
with
him
,
till
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
page
the
man
describe
have
no
more
resemblance
to
the
man
conceive
than
the
sign
-
board
at
the
corner
of
the
street
have
to
the
Duke
of
Cambridge
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
such
mechanical
descriptive
skill
would
hardly
give
more
satisfaction
to
the
reader
than
the
skill
of
the
photographer
<EOS>
do
to
the
anxious
mother
desirous
to
possess
an
absolute
duplicate
of
her
beloved
child
.
<EOS>
the
likeness
be
indeed
true
,
but
it
be
a
dull
,
dead
,
unfeeling
,
inauspicious
likeness
.
<EOS>
the
face
be
indeed
there
,
and
those
look
at
it
will
know
at
once
whose
image
it
be
,
but
the
owner
of
the
face
will
not
be
proud
of
the
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
royal
road
to
learning
,
no
short
cut
to
the
acquirement
of
any
valuable
art
.
<EOS>
let
photographer
and
daguerreotyper
do
what
they
will
,
and
improve
as
they
may
with
further
skill
on
that
which
skill
have
already
do
,
they
will
never
achieve
a
portrait
of
the
human
face
divine
.
<EOS>
let
biographer

novelist

and
the
rest
of
us
groan
as
we
may
under
the
burden
which
we
so
often
feel
too
heavy
for
our
shoulder
;
we
must
either
bear

too
weak

_
Labor

<EOS>
such
should
be
the
choose
motto
of
every
labourer
,
and
it
may
be
that
labour
,
if
adequately
endure
,
may
suffice
at
last
to
produce
even
some
not
untrue
resemblance
of
the
Rev.
Francis
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
of
his
doing
in
the
world
,
and
of
the
sort
of
fame
which
he
have
achieve
,
enough
have
be
already
say
.
<EOS>
It
have
also
be
say
that
he
be
forty
year
of
age
,
and
still
unmarried
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
young
son
of
a
country
gentleman
of
small
fortune
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
at
an
early
age
he
go
to
Winchester
,
and
be
intend
by
his
father
for
New
College
;
but
though
studious
as
a
boy
,
he
be
not
studious
within
the
prescribed
limit
,
and
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
leave
school
with
a
character
for
talent
,
but
without
a
scholarship
.
<EOS>
all
that
he
have
obtain
,
over
and
above
the
advantage
of
his
character
,
be
a
gold
medal
for
english
verse
,
and
hence
be
derive
a
strong
presumption
on
the
part
of
his
friend
that
he
be
destine
to
add
another
name
to
the
imperishable
list
of
english
poet
.
  
<EOS>
from
Winchester
he
go
to
Oxford
,
and
be
enter
as
a
commoner
at
Balliol
.
<EOS>
here
his
special
career
very
soon
commence
.
<EOS>
He
utterly
eschew
the
society
of
fast
man
,
give
no
wine
-
party
,
keep
no
horse
,
row
no
boat
,
join
no
row
,
and
be
the
pride
of
his
college
tutor
.
<EOS>
such
at
least
be
his
career
till
he
have
take
his
little
go
,
and
then
he
commence
a
course
of
action
which
,
though
not
less
creditable
to
himself
as
a
man
,
be
hardly
so
much
to
the
taste
of
the
tutor
.
<EOS>
He
become
a
member
of
a
vigorous
debating
society
,
and
render
himself
remarkable
there
for
humorous
energy
.
<EOS>
though
always
in
earnest
,
yet
his
earnestness
be
always
droll
.
<EOS>
to
be
true
in
his
idea
,
unanswerable
in
his
syllogism
,
and
just
in
his
aspiration
be
not
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
fail
,
fail
in
his
own
opinion
as
well
as
that
of
other
when
other
come
to
know
him
,
if
he
could
not
reduce
the
argument
of
his
opponent
to
an
absurdity
and
conquer
both
by
wit
and
reason
.
<EOS>
to
say
that
his
object
be
ever
to
raise
a
laugh
would
be
most
untrue
.
<EOS>
He
hate
such
common
and
unnecessary
evidence
of
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
a
joke
that
require
to
be
laugh
at
be
,
with
him
,
not
worth
utter
.
<EOS>
He
could
appreciate
by
a
keener
sense
than
that
of
his
ear
the
success
of
his
wit
,
and
would
see
in
the
eye
of
his
auditor
whether
or
no
he
be
understand
and
appreciate
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
religious
lad
before
he
leave
school
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
he
have
addict
himself
to
a
party
in
religion
,
and
have
do
so
have
receive
that
benefit
which
most
man
do
who
become
partisan
in
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
We
be
much
too
apt
to
look
at
schism
in
our
church
as
an
unmitigated
evil
.
<EOS>
moderate
schism
,
if
there
may
be
such
a
thing

at
any
rate
call
attention
to
the

draw
in
supporter
who
would
otherwise
have
be
inattentive
to
the

and
teach
man
to
think
upon
religion
.
<EOS>
how
great
an
amount
of
good
of
this
description
have
follow
that
movement
in
the
Church
of
England
which
commence
with
the
publication
of
Froude
's
remain
!
  
<EOS>
as
a
boy
young
Arabin
take
up
the
cudgel
on
the
side
of
the
Tractarians
,
and
at
Oxford
he
sit
for
a
while
at
the
foot
of
the
great
Newman
.
<EOS>
to
this
cause
he
lend
all
his
faculty
.
<EOS>
for
it
he
concoct
verse
,
for
it
he
make
speech
,
for
it
he
scintillate
the
bright
spark
of
his
quiet
wit
.
<EOS>
for
it
he
eat
and
drank
and
dress
and
have
his
being
.
<EOS>
in
due
process
of
time
he
take
his
degree
and
write
himself
B.A.
,
but
he
do
not
do
so
with
any
remarkable
amount
of
academical
éclat
.
<EOS>
He
have
occupy
himself
too
much
with
High
Church
matter
and
the
polemic
,
politic
,
and
outward
demonstration
usually
concurrent
with
High
Churchmanship
to
devote
himself
with
sufficient
vigour
to
the
acquisition
of
a
double
first
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
double
first
,
nor
even
a
first
class
man
,
but
he
revenge
himself
on
the
university
by
put
first
and
double
first
out
of
fashion
for
the
year
and
laugh
down
a
species
of
pedantry
which
,
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
three
,
leave
no
room
in
a
man
's
mind
for
graver
subject
than
conic
section
or
greek
accent
.
  
<EOS>
greek
accent
,
however
,
and
conic
section
be
esteem
necessary
at
Balliol
,
and
there
be
no
admittance
there
for
Mr.
Arabin
within
the
list
of
its
fellow
.
<EOS>
Lazarus
,
however
,
the
rich
and
most
comfortable
abode
of
Oxford
don
,
open
its
bosom
to
the
young
champion
of
a
church
militant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
ordain
,
and
become
a
fellow
soon
after
take
his
degree
,
and
shortly
after
that
be
choose
professor
of
poetry
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
come
the
moment
of
his
great
danger
.
<EOS>
after
many
mental
struggle
,
and
an
agony
of
doubt
which
may
be
well
surmise
,
the
great
prophet
of
the
Tractarians
confess
himself
a
roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Newman
leave
the
Church
of
England
and
with
him
carry
many
a
waverer
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
carry
off
Mr.
Arabin
,
but
the
escape
which
that
gentleman
have
be
a
very
narrow
one
.
<EOS>
He
leave
Oxford
for
awhile
that
he
may
meditate
in
complete
peace
on
the
step
which
appear
to
him
to
be
all
but
unavoidable
,
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
little
village
on
the
sea
-
shore
of
one
of
our
remote
county
,
that
he
may
learn
by
commune
with
his
own
soul
<EOS>
whether
or
no
he
could
with
a
safe
conscience
remain
within
the
pale
of
his
mother
church
.
  
<EOS>
thing
would
have
go
badly
with
him
there
have
he
be
leave
entirely
to
himself
.
<EOS>
everything
be
against
him
:
all
his
worldly
interest
require
him
to
remain
a
Protestant
,
and
he
look
on
his
worldly
interest
as
a
legion
of
foe
,
to
get
the
well
of
whom
be
a
point
of
extremest
honour
.
<EOS>
in
his
then
state
of
ecstatic
agony
such
a
conquest
would
have
cost
him
little
;
he
could
easily
have
throw
away
all
his
livelihood
;
but
it
cost
him
much
to
get
over
the
idea
that
by
choose
the
Church
of
England
he
should
be
open
in
his
own
mind
to
the
charge
that
he
have
be
lead
to
such
a
choice
by
unworthy
motive
.
<EOS>
then
his
heart
be
against
him
:
he
love
with
a
strong
and
eager
love
the
man
who
have
hitherto
be
his
guide
,
and
yearn
to
follow
his
footstep
.
<EOS>
His
taste
be
against
him
:
the
ceremony
and
pomp
of
the
Church
of
Rome
,
their
august
feast
and
solemn
fast
,
invite
his
imagination
and
please
his
eye
.
<EOS>
His
flesh
be
against
him
:
<EOS>
how
great
an
aid
would
it
be
to
a
poor
,
weak
,
wavering
man
to
be
constrain
to
high
moral
duty
,
self
-
denial
,
obedience
,
and
chastity
by
law
which
be
certain
in
their
enactment
,
and
not
to
be
break
without
loud
,
palpable
,
unmistakable
sin
!
<EOS>
then
his
faith
be
against
him
:
he
require
to
believe
so
much
;
pant
so
eagerly
to
give
sign
of
his
belief
;
deem
it
so
insufficient
to
wash
himself
simply
in
the
water
of
Jordan
;
that
some
great
deed
,
such
as
that
of
forsake
everything
for
a
true
Church
,
have
for
him
allurement
almost
past
withstand
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
at
this
time
a
very
young
man
,
and
when
he
leave
Oxford
for
his
far
retreat
be
much
too
confident
in
his
power
of
fence
,
and
too
apt
to
look
down
on
the
ordinary
sense
of
ordinary
people
,
to
expect
aid
in
the
battle
that
he
have
to
fight
from
any
chance
inhabitant
of
the
spot
which
he
have
select
.
<EOS>
but
Providence
be
good
to
him
;
there
,
in
that
all
but
desolate
place
,
on
the
storm
-
beat
shore
of
that
distant
sea
,
he
meet
one
who
gradually
calm
his
mind
,
quiet
his
imagination
,
and
teach
him
something
of
a
Christian
's
duty
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Arabin
leave
Oxford
,
he
be
inclined
to
look
upon
the
rural
clergyman
of
most
english
parish
almost
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
ambition
,
should
he
remain
within
the
fold
of
their
church
,
to
do
somewhat
towards
redeem
and
rectify
their
inferiority
and
to
assist
in
infuse
energy
and
faith
into
the
heart
of
christian
minister
,
who
be
,
as
he
think
,
too
often
satisfied
to
go
through
life
without
much
show
of
either
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
from
such
a
one
that
Mr.
Arabin
in
his
extremest
need
receive
that
aid
which
he
so
much
require
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
the
poor
curate
of
a
small
cornish
parish
that
he
first
learn
to
know
that
the
high
law
for
the
governance
of
a
Christian
's
duty
must
act
from
within
and
not
from
without
;
that
no
man
can
become
a
serviceable
servant
solely
by
obedience
to
write
edict
;
and
that
the
safety
which
he
be
about
to
seek
within
the
gate
of
Rome
be
no
other
than
the
selfish
freedom
from
personal
danger
which
the
bad
soldier
attempt
to
gain
who
counterfeit
illness
on
the
eve
of
battle
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
return
to
Oxford
a
humbler
but
a
well
and
a
happy
man
,
and
from
that
time
forth
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
as
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
for
which
he
have
be
educate
.
<EOS>
the
intercourse
of
those
among
whom
he
familiarly
live
keep
him
staunch
to
the
principle
of
that
system
of
the
Church
to
which
he
have
always
belong
.
<EOS>
since
his
severance
from
Mr.
Newman
,
no
one
have
have
so
strong
an
influence
over
him
as
the
head
of
his
college
.
<EOS>
during
the
time
of
his
expect
apostasy
Dr.
Gwynne
have
not
feel
much
predisposition
in
favour
of
the
young
fellow
.
<EOS>
though
a
High
Churchman
himself
within
moderate
limit
,
Dr.
Gwynne
feel
no
sympathy
with
man
who
could
not
satisfy

<EOS>
He
regard
the
enthusiasm
of
such
as
Newman
as
a
state
of
mind
more
nearly
ally
to
madness
than
to
religion
,
and
when
he
see
it
evince
by
very
young
man
,
he
be
inclined
to
attribute
a
good
deal
of
it
to
vanity
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
himself
,
though
a
religious
man
,
be
also
a
thoroughly
practical
man
of
the
world
,
and
he
regard
with
no
favourable
eye
the
tenet
of
anyone
who
look
on
the
two
thing
as
incompatible
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
half
roman
,
he
begin
to
regret
all
he
have
do
towards
bestow
a
fellowship
on
so
unworthy
a
recipient
;
and
when
again
he
learn
that
Mr.
Arabin
would
probably
complete
his
journey
to
Rome
,
he
regard
with
some
satisfaction
the
fact
that
in
such
case
the
fellowship
would
be
again
vacant
.
  
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
Mr.
Arabin
return
and
profess
himself
a
confirm
Protestant
,
the
Master
of
Lazarus
again
open
his
arm
to
him
,
and
gradually
he
become
the
pet
of
the
college
.
<EOS>
for
some
little
time
he
be
saturnine
,
silent
,
and
unwilling
to
take
any
prominent
part
in
university
broil
,
but
gradually
his
mind
recover
,
or
rather
make
its
tone
,
and
he
become
know
as
a
man
always
ready
at
a
moment
's
notice
to
take
up
the
cudgel
in
opposition
to
anything
that
savour
of
an
evangelical
bearing
.
<EOS>
He
be
great
in
sermon
,
great
on
platform
,
great
at
after
-
dinner
conversation
,
and
always
pleasant
as
well
as
great
.
<EOS>
He
take
delight
in
election
,
serve
on
committee
,
oppose
tooth
and
nail
all
project
of
university
reform
,
and
talk
jovially
over
his
glass
of
port
of
the
ruin
to
be
anticipate
by
the
Church
and
of
the
sacrilege
daily
commit
by
the
Whigs
.
<EOS>
the
ordeal
through
which
he
have
go
in
resist
the
blandishment
of
the
lady
of
Rome
have
certainly
do
much
towards
the
strengthening
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
although
in
small
and
outward
matter
he
be
self
-
confident
enough
,
nevertheless
in
thing
affect
the
inner
man
he
aim
at
a
humility
of
spirit
which
would
never
have
be
attractive
to
him
but
for
that
visit
to
the
coast
of
Cornwall
.
<EOS>
this
visit
he
now
repeat
every
year
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
an
interior
view
of
Mr.
Arabin
at
the
time
when
he
accept
the
living
of
St.
Ewold
.
<EOS>
exteriorly
,
he
be
not
a
remarkable
person
.
<EOS>
He
be
above
the
middle
height
,
well
-
make
,
and
very
active
.
<EOS>
His
hair
,
which
have
be
jet
black
,
be
now
tinge
with
gray
,
but
his
face
bear
no
sign
of
year
.
<EOS>
It
would
perhaps
be
wrong
to
say
that
he
be
handsome
,
but
his
face
be
nevertheless
pleasant
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
the
cheek
-
bone
be
rather
too
high
for
beauty
,
and
the
formation
of
the
forehead
too
massive
and
heavy
:
but
the
eye
,
nose
,
and
mouth
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
continual
play
of
lambent
fire
about
his
eye
,
which
give
promise
of
either
pathos
or
humour
whenever
he
essay
to
speak
,
and
that
promise
be
rarely
break
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
gentle
play
about
his
mouth
which
declare
that
his
wit
never
descend
to
sarcasm
,
and
that
there
be
no
ill
-
nature
in
his
repartee
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
popular
man
among
woman
,
but
more
so
as
a
general
than
a
special
favourite
.
<EOS>
live
as
a
fellow
at
Oxford
,
marriage
with
him
have
be
out
of
the
question
,
and
it
may
be
doubt
whether
he
have
ever
allow
his
heart
to
be
touch
.
<EOS>
though
belong
to
a
church
in
which
celibacy
be
not
the
require
lot
of
its
minister
,
he
have
come
to
regard
himself
as
one
of
those
clergyman
to
whom
to
be
a
bachelor
be
almost
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
look
for
parochial
duty
,
and
his
career
at
Oxford
be
utterly
incompatible
with
such
domestic
joy
as
a
wife
and
nursery
.
<EOS>
He
look
on
woman
,
therefore
,
in
the
same
light
that
one
see
them
regard
by
many
romish
priest
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
have
near
him
that
which
be
pretty
and
amusing
,
but
woman
generally
be
little
more
to
him
than
child
.
<EOS>
He
talk
to
them
without
put
out
all
his
power
,
and
listen
to
them
without
any
idea
that
what
he
should
hear
from
them
could
either
actuate
his
conduct
or
influence
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Mr.
Arabin
,
the
new
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
,
who
be
go
to
stay
with
the
Grantlys
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
reach
Plumstead
the
day
before
Mr.
Harding
and
Eleanor
,
and
the
Grantly
family
be
thus
enable
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
discuss
his
qualification
before
the
arrival
of
the
other
guest
.
<EOS>
Griselda
be
surprised
to
find
that
he
look
so
young
,
but
she
tell
Florinda
her
young
sister
,
when
they
have
retire
for
the
night
,
that
he
do
not
talk
at
all
like
a
young
man
:
and
she
decide
with
the
authority
that
seventeen
have
over
sixteen
that
he
be
not
at
all
nice
,
although
his
eye
be
lovely
.
<EOS>
as
usual
,
sixteen
implicitly
accede
to
the
dictum
of
seventeen
in
such
a
matter
,
and
say
that
he
certainly
be
not
nice
.
<EOS>
They
then
branch
off
on
the
relative
merit
of
other
clerical
bachelor
in
the
vicinity
,
and
both
determine
without
any
feeling
of
jealousy
between
them
that
a
certain
Rev.
Augustus
Green
be
by
many
degree
the
most
estimable
of
the
lot
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
in
question
have
certainly
much
in
his
favour
,
as
,
have
a
comfortable
allowance
from
his
father
,
he
could
devote
the
whole
proceed
of
his
curacy
to
violet
glove
and
unexceptionable
neck
tie
.
<EOS>
have
thus
fixedly
resolve
that
the
new
-
comer
have
nothing
about
him
to
shake
the
pre
-
eminence
of
the
exalted
Green
,
the
two
girl
go
to
sleep
in
each
other
's
arm
,
content
with
themselves
and
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
at
first
sight
come
to
much
the
same
conclusion
about
her
husband
's
favourite
as
her
daughter
have
do
,
though
,
in
seek
to
measure
his
relative
value
,
she
do
not
compare
him
to
Mr.
Green
;
indeed
,
she
make
no
comparison
by
name
between
him
and
anyone
else
;
but
she
remark
to
her
husband
that
one
person
's
swans
be
very
often
another
person
's
geese
,
thereby
clearly
show
that
Mr.
Arabin
have
not
yet
prove
his
qualification
in
swanhood
to
her
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Susan
,
"
say
he
,
rather
offend
at
hear
his
friend
speak
of
so
disrespectfully
,
"
if
you
take
Mr.
Arabin
for
a
goose
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
think
very
highly
of
your
discrimination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
goose
!
<EOS>
no
,
of
course
,
he
be
not
a
goose
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
be
a
very
clever
man
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
so
matter
-
of
-
fact
,
<EOS>
Archdeacon
,
when
it
suit
your
purpose
,
that
one
can
not
trust
oneself
to
any
_
façon
de
parler
_
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
very
valuable
man
 
at
Oxford
 
and
that
he
will
be
a
good
vicar
at
St.
Ewold
.
<EOS>
all
I
mean
be
that
,
have
pass
one
evening
with
him
,
I
do
not
find
him
to
be
absolutely
a
paragon
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
he
be
a
little
inclined
to
be
conceite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
all
the
man
that
I
know
intimately
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
<EOS>
"
Arabin
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
most
free
from
any
taint
of
self
-
conceit
.
<EOS>
His
fault
be
that
he
be
too
diffident
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
"
say
the
lady
;
"
only
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
do
not
find
it
out
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
further
be
say
about
him
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
think
that
his
wife
be
abuse
Mr.
Arabin
merely
because
he
have
praise
him
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
know
that
it
be
useless
argue
for
or
against
any
person
in
favour
of
or
in
opposition
to
whom
the
archdeacon
have
already
pronounce
a
strong
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
in
truth
,
they
be
both
right
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
diffident
man
in
social
intercourse
with
those
whom
he
do
not
intimately
know
;
when
place
in
situation
which
it
be
his
business
to
fill
,
and
discuss
matter
with
which
it
be
his
duty
to
be
conversant
,
Mr.
Arabin
be
from
habit
brazen
-
faced
enough
.
<EOS>
when
stand
on
a
platform
in
Exeter
Hall
,
no
man
would
be
less
mazed
than
he
by
the
eye
of
the
crowd
before
him
,
for
such
be
the
work
which
his
profession
have
call
on
him
to
perform
;
but
he
shrink
from
a
strong
expression
of
opinion
in
general
society
,
and
his
do
so
not
uncommonly
make
it
appear
that
he
consider
the
company
not
worth
the
trouble
of
his
energy
.
<EOS>
He
be
averse
to
dictate
when
the
place
do
not
seem
to
him
to
justify
dictation
,
and
as
those
subject
on
which
people
wish
to
hear
him
speak
be
such
as
he
be
accustomed
to
treat
with
decision
,
he
generally
shun
the
trap
there
be
lay
to
allure
him
into
discussion
,
and
,
by
do
so
,
not
infrequently
subject
himself
to
such
charge
as
those
bring
against
him
by
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
he
sit
at
his
open
window
,
enjoy
the
delicious
moonlight
and
gaze
at
the
gray
tower
of
the
church
,
which
stand
almost
within
the
rectory
ground
,
little
dreamed
that
he
be
the
subject
of
so
many
friendly
or
unfriendly
criticism
.
<EOS>
consider
how
much
we
be
all
give
to
discuss
the
character
of
other
,
and
discuss
them
often
not
in
the
strict
spirit
of
charity
,
it
be
singular
how
little
we
be
inclined
to
think
that
other
can
speak
ill
-
naturedly
of
us
,
and
how
angry
and
hurt
we
be
when
proof
reach
us
that
they
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
we
all
of
us
occasionally
speak
of
our
dear
friend
in
a
manner
in
which
those
dear
friend
would
very
little
like
to
hear
themselves
mention
,
and
that
we
nevertheless
expect
that
our
dear
friend
shall
invariably
speak
of
us
as
though
they
be
blind
to
all
our
fault
,
but
keenly
alive
to
every
shade
of
our
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
Mr.
Arabin
that
he
be
speak
of
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
,
when
he
compare
himself
with
his
host
,
that
he
be
a
person
of
so
little
consequence
to
any
,
that
he
be
worth
no
one
's
word
or
thought
.
<EOS>
He
be
utterly
alone
in
the
world
as
regard
domestic
tie
and
those
inner
familiar
relation
which
be
hardly
possible
between
other
than
husband
and
wife
,
parent
and
child
,
or
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
discuss
with
himself
the
necessity
of
such
bond
for
a
man
's
happiness
in
this
world
,
and
have
generally
satisfy
himself
with
the
answer
that
happiness
in
this
world
be
not
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
Herein
he
deceive
himself
,
or
rather
try
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
,
like
other
,
yearn
for
the
enjoyment
of
whatever
he
see
enjoyable
,
and
though
he
attempt
,
with
the
modern
stoicism
of
so
many
Christians
,
to
make
himself
believe
that
joy
and
sorrow
be
matter
which
here
should
be
hold
as
perfectly
indifferent
,
these
thing
be
not
indifferent
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
tired
of
his
Oxford
room
and
his
college
life
.
<EOS>
He
regard
the
wife
and
child
of
his
friend
with
something
like
envy
;
<EOS>
he
all
but
covet
the
pleasant
drawing
-
room
,
with
its
pretty
window
open
on
to
lawn
and
flower
-
bed
,
the
apparel
of
the
comfortable
house
,
and
 
above
all
 
the
air
of
home
which
encompass
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
say
that
no
time
can
have
be
so
fit
for
such
desire
on
his
part
as
this
,
when
he
have
just
possess
himself
of
a
country
parish
,
of
a
living
among
field
and
garden
,
of
a
house
which
a
wife
would
grace
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
there
be
a
difference
between
the
opulence
of
plumstead
and
the
modest
economy
of
St.
Ewold
,
but
surely
Mr.
Arabin
be
not
a
man
to
sigh
after
wealth
!
<EOS>
of
all
man
,
his
friend
would
have
unanimously
declare
he
be
the
last
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
how
little
our
friend
know
us
!
<EOS>
in
his
period
of
stoical
rejection
of
this
world
's
happiness
,
he
have
cast
from
him
as
utter
dross
all
anxiety
as
to
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
as
it
be
,
proclaim
himself
to
be
indifferent
to
promotion
,
and
those
who
chiefly
admire
his
talent
,
and
would
mainly
have
exert
themselves
to
secure
to
them
their
deserved
reward
,
have
take
him
at
his
word
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
if
the
truth
must
out
,
he
feel
himself
disappoint
 
<EOS>
disappoint
not
by
them
but
by
himself
.
<EOS>
the
daydream
of
his
youth
be
over
,
and
at
the
age
of
forty
he
feel
that
he
be
not
fit
to
work
in
the
spirit
of
an
apostle
.
<EOS>
He
have
mistake
himself
,
and
learn
his
mistake
when
it
be
past
remedy
.
<EOS>
He
have
profess
himself
indifferent
to
mitre
and
diaconal
residence
,
to
rich
living
and
pleasant
glebe
,
and
now
he
have
to
own
to
himself
that
he
be
sigh
for
the
good
thing
of
other
man
on
whom
,
in
his
pride
,
he
have
venture
to
look
down
.
  
<EOS>
not
for
wealth
,
in
its
vulgar
sense
,
have
he
ever
sigh
;
not
for
the
enjoyment
of
rich
thing
<EOS>
have
he
ever
long
;
but
for
the
allotted
share
of
worldly
bliss
<EOS>
which
a
wife
,
and
child
,
and
happy
home
could
give
him
,
for
that
usual
amount
of
comfort
which
he
have
venture
to
reject
as
unnecessary
for
him
<EOS>
,
he
do
now
feel
that
he
would
have
be
wise
to
have
search
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
that
his
talent
,
his
position
,
and
his
friend
would
have
win
for
him
promotion
,
have
he
put
himself
in
the
way
of
win
it
.
<EOS>
instead
of
do
so
,
he
have
allow
himself
to
be
persuade
to
accept
a
living
which
would
give
him
an
income
of
some
£
300
a
year
<EOS>
should
he
,
by
marry
,
throw
up
his
fellowship
.
<EOS>
such
,
at
the
age
of
forty
,
be
the
worldly
result
of
labour
which
the
world
have
choose
to
regard
as
successful
.
<EOS>
the
world
also
think
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
,
in
his
own
estimation
,
sufficiently
pay
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
world
be
mistaken
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
be
begin
to
ascertain
that
such
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
may
I
beg
the
reader
not
to
be
hard
in
his
judgement
upon
this
man
.
<EOS>
be
not
the
state
at
which
he
have
arrive
the
natural
result
of
effort
to
reach
that
which
be
not
the
condition
of
humanity
?
<EOS>
be
not
modern
stoicism
,
build
though
it
be
on
Christianity
,
as
great
an
outrage
on
human
nature
as
be
the
stoicism
of
the
ancient
?
<EOS>
the
philosophy
of
Zeno
be
build
on
true
law
,
but
on
true
law
misunderstood
and
therefore
misapplied
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
our
Stoics
here
,
who
would
teach
us
that
wealth
and
worldly
comfort
and
happiness
on
earth
be
not
worth
the
search
.
<EOS>
alas
,
for
a
doctrine
which
can
find
no
believe
pupil
and
no
true
teacher
!
  
<EOS>
the
case
of
Mr.
Arabin
be
the
more
singular
,
as
he
belong
to
a
branch
of
the
Church
of
England
well
inclined
to
regard
its
temporality
with
avow
favour
,
and
have
habitually
live
with
man
who
be
accustomed
to
much
worldly
comfort
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
his
idiosyncrasy
that
these
very
fact
have
produce
within
him
,
in
early
life
,
a
state
of
mind
that
be
not
natural
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
content
to
be
a
High
Churchman
,
if
he
could
be
so
on
principle
of
his
own
and
could
strike
out
a
course
show
a
mark
difference
from
those
with
whom
he
consort
.
<EOS>
He
be
ready
to
be
a
partisan
as
long
as
he
be
allow
to
have
a
course
of
action
and
of
thought
unlike
that
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
His
party
have
indulge
him
,
and
he
begin
to
feel
that
his
party
be
right
and
himself
wrong
,
just
when
such
a
conviction
be
too
late
to
be
of
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
discover
,
when
such
discovery
be
no
longer
serviceable
,
that
it
would
have
be
worth
his
while
to
have
work
for
the
usual
pay
assign
to
work
in
this
world
and
have
earn
a
wife
and
child
,
with
a
carriage
for
them
to
sit
in
;
to
have
earn
a
pleasant
dining
-
room
,
in
which
his
friend
could
drink
his
wine
,
and
the
power
of
walk
up
the
high
street
of
his
country
town
,
with
the
knowledge
that
all
its
tradesman
would
have
gladly
welcome
him
within
their
door
.
<EOS>
other
man
arrive
at
those
conviction
in
their
start
in
life
and
so
work
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
to
him
they
have
come
when
they
be
too
late
to
be
of
use
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
man
of
pleasantry
,
and
it
may
be
think
that
such
a
state
of
mind
as
that
described
would
be
antagonistic
to
humour
.
<EOS>
but
surely
such
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
Wit
be
the
outward
mental
casing
of
the
man
,
and
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
inner
mind
of
thought
and
feeling
than
have
the
rich
brocaded
garment
of
the
priest
at
the
altar
with
the
asceticism
of
the
anchorite
below
them
,
whose
skin
be
torment
with
sackcloth
and
whose
body
be
half
-
flay
with
rod
.
<EOS>
nay
,
will
not
such
a
one
often
rejoice
more
than
any
other
in
the
rich
show
of
his
outer
apparel
?
<EOS>
Will
it
not
be
food
for
his
pride
to
feel
that
he
groan
inwardly
while
he
shine
outwardly
?
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
the
mental
effort
which
man
make
.
<EOS>
those
which
they
show
forth
daily
to
the
world
be
often
the
opposite
of
the
inner
working
of
the
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
archdeacon
's
drawing
-
room
,
Mr.
Arabin
have
sparkle
with
his
usual
unaffected
brilliancy
,
but
when
he
retire
to
his
bedroom
,
he
sit
there
sad
,
at
his
open
window
,
repine
within
himself
that
he
also
have
no
wife
,
no
bairn
,
no
soft
sward
of
lawn
duly
mown
for
him
to
lie
on
,
no
herd
of
attendant
curate
,
no
bowing
from
the
banker
's
clerk
,
no
rich
rectory
.
<EOS>
that
apostleship
that
he
have
think
of
have
evade
his
grasp
,
and
he
be
now
only
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
with
a
taste
for
a
mitre
.
<EOS>
truly
he
have
fall
between
two
stool
.
   
<EOS>
St.
Ewold
's
parsonage
 
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Harding
and
Mrs.
Bold
reach
the
rectory
on
the
follow
morning
,
the
archdeacon
and
his
friend
be
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
They
have
go
over
that
the
new
vicar
may
inspect
his
church
and
be
introduce
to
the
squire
,
and
be
not
expect
back
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
ramble
out
by
himself
and
stroll
,
as
be
his
will
not
at
Plumstead
,
about
the
lawn
and
round
the
church
;
and
as
he
do
so
,
the
two
sister
naturally
fall
into
conversation
about
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
sisterly
confidence
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
be
ten
year
old
than
Eleanor
,
and
have
be
marry
while
Eleanor
be
yet
a
child
.
<EOS>
They
have
never
,
therefore
,
pour
into
each
other
's
ear
their
hope
and
love
;
and
now
that
one
be
a
wife
and
the
other
a
widow
,
it
be
not
probable
that
they
would
begin
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
They
live
too
much
asunder
to
be
able
to
fall
into
that
kind
of
intercourse
which
make
confidence
between
sister
almost
a
necessity
;
moreover
,
that
which
be
so
easy
at
eighteen
be
often
very
difficult
at
twenty
-
eight
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
know
this
,
and
do
not
,
therefore
,
expect
confidence
from
her
sister
;
yet
she
long
to
ask
her
whether
in
real
truth
Mr.
Slope
be
agreeable
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
mean
difficult
to
turn
the
conversation
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
that
gentleman
have
become
so
famous
at
Barchester
,
have
so
much
to
do
with
all
clergyman
connect
with
the
city
,
and
be
so
specially
concerned
in
the
affair
of
Mr.
Harding
,
that
it
would
have
be
odd
if
Mr.
Harding
's
daughter
have
not
talk
about
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
be
soon
abuse
him
,
which
she
do
with
her
whole
heart
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
be
nearly
as
eager
to
defend
him
.
<EOS>
She
positively
dislike
the
man
,
would
have
be
delight
to
learn
that
he
have
take
himself
off
so
that
she
should
never
see
him
again
,
have
indeed
almost
a
fear
of
him
,
and
yet
she
constantly
find
herself
take
his
part
.
<EOS>
the
abuse
of
other
people
,
and
abuse
of
a
nature
that
she
feel
to
be
unjust
,
impose
this
necessity
on
her
,
and
at
last
make
Mr.
Slope
's
defence
an
habitual
course
of
argument
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
from
Mr.
Slope
the
conversation
turn
to
the
Stanhopes
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
be
listen
with
some
interest
to
Eleanor
's
account
of
the
family
,
when
it
drop
out
that
Mr.
Slope
make
one
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
say
the
lady
of
the
rectory
.
"
<EOS>
be
Mr.
Slope
there
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
merely
reply
that
such
have
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Eleanor
,
he
must
be
very
fond
of
you
,
I
think
;
he
seem
to
follow
you
everywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
even
this
do
not
open
Eleanor
's
eye
.
<EOS>
She
merely
laugh
,
and
say
that
she
imagine
Mr.
Slope
find
other
attraction
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
part
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
feel
quite
convinced
that
the
odious
match
would
take
place
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
as
convinced
that
that
unfortunate
chaplain
,
disagreeable
as
he
must
be
allow
to
be
,
be
more
sin
against
than
sin
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
of
course
hear
before
dinner
that
Eleanor
have
remain
the
day
before
in
Barchester
with
the
view
of
meet
Mr.
Slope
,
and
that
she
have
so
meet
him
.
<EOS>
He
remember
how
she
have
positively
state
that
there
be
to
be
no
guest
at
the
Stanhopes
,
and
he
do
not
hesitate
to
accuse
her
of
deceit
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
fact
,
or
rather
presume
fact
,
of
her
be
deceitful
on
such
a
matter
speak
but
too
plainly
in
evidence
against
her
as
to
her
imputed
crime
of
receive
Mr.
Slope
as
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
that
anything
we
can
do
will
be
too
late
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
be
fairly
surprised
.
<EOS>
I
never
like
your
sister
's
taste
with
regard
to
man
,
but
still
I
do
not
give
her
credit
for
 
ugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
soon
,
too
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
think
more
,
perhaps
,
of
her
sister
's
indecorum
in
have
a
lover
before
she
have
put
off
her
weed
than
her
bad
taste
in
have
such
a
lover
as
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
be
harsh
,
or
to
do
anything
that
can
hurt
your
father
;
but
,
positively
,
<EOS>
neither
that
man
nor
his
wife
shall
come
within
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
sigh
,
and
then
attempt
to
console
herself
and
her
lord
by
remark
that
,
after
all
,
the
thing
be
not
accomplish
yet
.
<EOS>
now
that
Eleanor
be
at
Plumstead
,
much
may
be
do
to
wean
her
from
her
fatal
passion
.
<EOS>
poor
Eleanor
!
  
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
off
without
anything
to
make
it
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
discuss
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
with
the
archdeacon
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
and
Mr.
Harding
,
who
know
the
personage
of
the
parish
,
join
in
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
also
know
them
,
but
she
say
little
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
do
not
apparently
take
much
notice
of
her
,
and
she
be
not
in
a
humour
to
receive
at
that
time
with
any
special
grace
any
special
favourite
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Her
first
idea
on
reach
her
bedroom
be
that
a
much
pleasanter
family
party
may
be
meet
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
than
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
think
that
she
be
get
tired
of
clergyman
and
their
respectable
,
humdrum
,
wearisome
mode
of
living
,
and
that
after
all
,
people
in
the
outer
world
,
who
have
live
in
Italy
,
London
,
or
elsewhere
,
need
not
necessarily
be
regard
as
atrocious
and
abominable
.
<EOS>
the
Stanhopes
,
she
have
think
,
be
a
giddy
,
thoughtless
,
extravagant
set
of
people
,
but
she
have
see
nothing
wrong
about
them
and
have
,
on
the
other
hand
,
find
that
they
thoroughly
know
how
to
make
their
house
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
,
she
think
,
that
the
archdeacon
should
not
have
a
little
of
the
same
_
savoir
vivre
_
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
we
have
say
,
do
not
apparently
take
much
notice
of
her
,
but
yet
he
do
not
go
to
bed
without
feel
that
he
have
be
in
company
with
a
very
pretty
woman
;
and
as
be
the
case
with
most
bachelor
,
and
some
married
man
,
regard
the
prospect
of
his
month
's
visit
at
plumstead
in
a
pleasanter
light
when
he
learn
that
a
very
pretty
woman
be
to
share
it
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
before
they
all
retire
it
be
settle
that
the
whole
party
should
drive
over
on
the
follow
day
to
inspect
the
parsonage
at
St.
Ewold
.
<EOS>
the
three
clergyman
be
to
discuss
dilapidation
,
and
the
two
lady
be
to
lend
their
assistance
in
suggest
such
change
as
may
be
necessary
for
a
bachelor
's
abode
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
soon
after
breakfast
the
carriage
be
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
room
for
four
inside
,
and
the
archdeacon
get
upon
the
box
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
find
herself
opposite
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
in
a
manner
force
into
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
soon
on
comfortable
term
together
,
and
have
she
think
about
it
,
she
would
have
think
that
,
in
spite
of
his
black
cloth
,
Mr.
Arabin
would
not
have
be
a
bad
addition
to
the
Stanhope
family
party
.
  
<EOS>
now
that
the
archdeacon
be
away
they
could
all
trifle
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
begin
by
tell
them
in
the
most
innocent
manner
imaginable
an
old
legend
about
Mr.
Arabin
's
new
parish
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
he
say
,
in
day
of
yore
an
illustrious
priestess
of
St.
Ewold
,
fame
through
the
whole
country
for
cure
all
manner
of
disease
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
well
,
as
all
priestess
have
ever
have
,
which
well
be
extant
to
this
day
,
and
share
in
the
mind
of
many
of
the
people
the
sanctity
which
belong
to
the
consecrated
ground
of
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
declare
that
he
should
look
on
such
tenet
on
the
part
of
his
parishioner
as
anything
but
orthodox
.
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Grantly
reply
that
she
so
entirely
disagree
with
him
as
to
think
that
no
parish
be
in
a
proper
state
that
have
not
its
priestess
as
well
as
its
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
duty
be
never
well
do
,
"
say
she
,
"
unless
they
be
so
divided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Papa
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
that
in
the
olden
time
the
priestess
bear
all
the
sway
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
perhaps
,
think
that
such
may
be
too
much
the
case
now
if
a
sacred
lady
be
admit
within
the
parish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
it
be
safe
to
run
no
such
risk
.
<EOS>
no
priestly
pride
have
ever
exceed
that
of
sacerdotal
female
.
<EOS>
a
very
lowly
curate
I
may
,
perhaps
,
essay
to
rule
,
but
a
curatess
would
be
sure
to
get
the
well
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
certainly
example
of
such
accident
happen
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
say
that
there
be
a
priestess
at
Barchester
who
be
very
imperious
in
all

<EOS>
the

complaint
which
you
make
of
me
for
battle
with
another
clergyman
of
our
own
church

the
Mohammedan
would
make
against
me
for
battle
with
the
error
of
a
priest
of
Rome

<EOS>
yet
,
surely
,
you
would
not
be
incline
to
say
that
I
should
be
wrong
to
do
battle
with
such
as
him
.
<EOS>
a
pagan
,
too
,
with
his
multiplicity
of
god
,
would
think
it
equally
odd
that
the
Christian
and
the
Mohammedan
should
disagree

More
scandal
would
fall
on
the

<EOS>
We
have

one

by
that
of

<EOS>
He
pause
and
stand
silent
for
awhile

think
of
the
time
when
he
have
so
nearly
sacrifice
all
he
have

his
power
of
mind
,
his
free
agency
,
the
fresh
running
water
of
his

fountain
,
his
very
inner
self
,
for
an
easy
path
in
which
no
fighting
would
be
need
;
and
then
he
continue
:
"
what
you
say
be
partly
true
:
our
contention
do
bring
on
us
some
scandal

<EOS>
the
outer
world
,
though
it
constantly
revile
us
for
our
human
infirmity
and
throw
in
our
tooth
the
fact
that
be

we
be
still
no
more
than
man
,
demand
of
us
that
we
should
do
our
work
with
godlike
perfection
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
god
-
like
about
us
:
we
differ
from
each
other
with
the
acerbity
common
to
man
;
we
triumph
over
each
other
with
human
frailty
;
we
allow
difference
on
subject
of
divine
origin
to
produce
among
us
antipathy
and
enmity
which
be
anything
but
divine
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
true

<EOS>
but
what
would
you
have
in
place
of
it
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
infallible
head
for
a
church
on
earth

<EOS>
this
dream
of

have
be
try

we
see
in

be
no
bickering
within

pale
of

Pope

Church

<EOS>
such
an
assumption
would
be
utterly
untrue
,
but
let
us
grant
it
,
and
then
let
us
say
which
church
have
incur
the
heavy
scandal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
quiet
earnestness
about
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
he
half
-
acknowledge
and
half
-
defend
himself
from
the
charge
bring
against
him
,
which
surprise
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
use
all
her
life
to
listen
to
clerical
discussion
,
but
the
point
at
issue
between
the
disputant
have
so
seldom
be
of
more
than
temporal
significance
as
to
have
leave
on
her
mind
no
feeling
of
reverence
for
such
subject
.
<EOS>
there
have
always
be
a
hard
worldly
leaven
of
the
love
either
of
income
or
of
power
in
the
strain
she
have
hear
;
there
have
be
no
panting
for
the
truth
;
no
aspiration
after
religious
purity
.
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
take
for
grant
by
those
around
her
that
they
be
indubitably
right
;
that
there
be
no
ground
for
doubt
;
that
the
hard
uphill
work
of
ascertain
what
the
duty
of
a
clergyman
should
be
have
be
already
accomplish
in
full
;
and
that
what
remain
for
an
active
militant
parson
to
do
be
to
hold
his
own
against
all
comer
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
it
be
true
,
be
an
exception
to
this
,
but
then
he
be
so
essentially
anti
-
militant
in
all
thing
that
she
class
him
in
her
own
mind
apart
from
all
other
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
argue
the
matter
within
herself
,
or
consider
whether
this
common
tone
be
or
be
not
faulty
;
but
she
be
sick
of
it
without
know
that
she
be
so
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
find
to
her
surprise
,
and
not
without
a
certain
pleasurable
excitement
,
that
this
new
-
comer
among
them
speak
in
a
manner
very
different
from
that
to
which
she
be
accustomed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
easy
to
condemn
,
"
say
he
,
continue
the
thread
of
his
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
life
that
must
be
so
delicious
as
that
of
a
writer
for
newspaper

or
a
lead
member
of
the
opposition
 
to
thunder
forth
accusation
against
man
in
power

to
show
up
the
bad
side

everything
that
be
produce

to
pick
hole
in

coat

to
be
indignant

sarcastic

jocose

moral

supercilious

to
damn
with
faint
praise

crush
with
open
calumny

<EOS>
what
can
be
so
easy
as
this
when
the
critic
have
to
be
responsible
for
nothing

You
condemn
what
I
do

put
yourself
in

the
reverse

you
fitly

elegant

you

It
would
do
very
well
for
a
round
table
,

suggest
the
ex

warden
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
something
peculiarly
unorthodox
,
in
the
archdeacon
's
estimation
,
in
the
idea
of
a
round
table
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
be
accustomed
to
a
goodly
board
of
decent
length
,
comfortably
elongate
itself
accord
to
the
number
of
the
guest
,
nearly
black
with
perpetual
rubbing
,
and
as
bright
as
a
mirror
.
<EOS>
now
round
dinner
-
table
be
generally
of
oak
,
or
else
of
such
new
construction
as
not
to
have
acquire
the
peculiar
hue
which
be
so
pleasing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
connect
them
with
what
he
call
the
nasty
newfangle
method
of
leave
a
cloth
on
the
table
,
as
though
to
warn
people
that
they
be
not
to
sit
long
.
<EOS>
in
his
eye
there
be
something
democratic
and
parvenu
in
a
round
table
.
<EOS>
He
imagine
that
dissenter
and
calico
-
printer
chiefly
use
them
,
and
perhaps
a
few
literary
lion
more
conspicuous
for
their
wit
than
their
gentility
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
flurried
at
the
idea
of
such
an
article
be
introduce
into
the
diocese
by
a
protégé
of
his
own
,
and
at
the
instigation
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
round
dinner
-
table
,
"
say
he
with
some
heat
,
"
be
the
most
abominable
article
of
furniture
that
ever
be
invent
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
Arabin
have
more
taste
than
to
allow
such
a
thing
in
his
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
feel
himself
completely
snub
,
and
of
course
say
nothing
further
;
but
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
have
yield
submissively
in
the
small
matter
of
the
cellar
and
kitchen
grate
,
find
himself
oblige
to
oppose
reform
which
may
be
of
a
nature
too
expensive
for
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
seem
to
me
,
Archdeacon
,
that
I
can
not
very
well
lengthen
the
room
without
pull
down
the
wall
,
and
if
I
pull
down
the
wall
,
I
must
build
it
up
again
;
then
if
I
throw
out
a
bow
on
this
side
,
I
must
do
the
same
on
the
other

and
if
I
do
it
for
the
ground
floor
,
I
must
carry
it
up
to
the
floor
above
.
<EOS>
that
will
be
put
a
new
front
to
the
house
and
will
cost
,
I
suppose
,
a
couple
of
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
the
ecclesiastical
commissioner
will
hardly
assist
me
when
they
hear
that
my
grievance
consist
in
have
a
dining
-
room
only
sixteen
foot
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
proceed
to
explain
that
nothing
would
be
easy
than
add
six
foot
to
the
front
of
the
dining
-
room
without
touch
any
other
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
such
irregularity
of
construction
in
small
country
-
house
be
,
he
say
,
rather
graceful
than
otherwise
,
and
he
offer
to
pay
for
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
own
pocket
if
it
cost
more
than
forty
pound

<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
however
,
be
firm
,
and
,
although
the
archdeacon
fuss
and
fume
about
it
,
would
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
forty
pound
,
he
say
,
be
a
matter
of
serious
moment
to
him
,
and
his
friend
,
if
under
such
circumstance
they
would
be
good
-
natured
enough
to
come
to
him
at
all
,
must
put
up
with
the
misery
of
a
square
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
willing
to
compromise
matter
by
disclaim
any
intention
of
have
a
round
table

<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
Mrs.

"
what
if
the

insist
on
have
both
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

the

in

I
have
no

the

to

I
be
quite
sure
that

when

will
not
come
empty

<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
however
,
do
not
appear
well
inclined
to
enter
into
speculative
expense
on
such
a
chance
as
this
,
and
therefore
any
material
alteration
in
the
house

the
cost
of
which
could
not

with

the
archdeacon

suggest
,
and
carry
all
point
before
him
in

manner
very

a

agree
at

It

further
agree
also
that

<EOS>
Wilfred
Thorne
,
Esq

,
of
Ullathorne
,
be
the
squire
of
St.
Ewold
's
 
or
,
rather
,
the
squire
of
Ullathorne
,
for
the
domain
of
the
modern
landlord
be
of
wide
notoriety
than
the
fame
of
the
ancient
saint
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
fair
speciman
of
what
that
race
have
come
to
in
our
day
which
,
a
century
ago
,
be
,
as
we
be
tell
,
fairly
represent
by
Squire
Western
.
<EOS>
if
that
representation
be
a
true
one
,
few
class
of
man
can
have
make
fast
stride
in
improvement
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
however
,
be
a
man
possess
of
quite
a
sufficient
number
of
foible
to
lay
him
open
to
much
ridicule
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
a
bachelor
,
be
about
fifty
,
and
be
not
a
little
proud
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
when
live
at
home
at
Ullathorne
,
there
be
not
much
room
for
such
pride
,
and
there
therefore
he
always
look
like
a
gentleman
and
like
that
which
he
certainly
be
,
the
first
man
in
his
parish
.
<EOS>
but
during
the
month
or
six
week
which
he
annually
spend
in
London
,
he
try
so
hard
to
look
like
a
great
man
there
also
,
which
he
certainly
be
not
,
that
he
be
put
down
as
a
fool
by
many
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
considerable
literary
attainment
in
a
certain
way
and
on
certain
subject
.
<EOS>
His
favourite
author
be
Montaigne
and
Burton
,
and
he
know
more
perhaps
than
any
other
man
in
his
own
county
and
the
next
to
it
of
the
english
essayist
of
the
two
last
century
.
<EOS>
He
possess
complete
set
of
the
Idler
,
the
Spectator
,
the
Tatler
,
the
Guardian
,
and
the
Rambler
,
and
would
discourse
by
hour
together
on
the
superiority
of
such
publication
to
anything
which
have
since
be
produce
in
our
Edinburghs
and
quarterly
.
<EOS>
He
be
proficient
in
all
question
of
genealogy
,
and
know
enough
of
almost
every
gentleman
's
family
in
England
to
say
of
what
blood
and
lineage
be
descend
all
those
who
have
any
claim
to
be
consider
as
possessor
of
any
such
luxury
.
<EOS>
for
blood
and
lineage
he
himself
have
a
most
profound
respect
.
<EOS>
He
count
back
his
own
ancestor
to
some
period
long
antecedent
to
the
Conquest
,
and
could
tell
you
,
if
you
would
listen
to
him
,
how
it
have
come
to
pass
that
they
,
like
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
have
be
permit
to
hold
their
own
among
the
Norman
baron
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
accord
to
his
showing
,
on
account
of
any
weak
complaisance
on
the
part
of
his
family
towards
their
Norman
neighbour
.
<EOS>
some
ealfried
of
Ullathorne
once
fortify
his
own
castle
and
hold
out
,
not
only
that
,
but
the
then
exist
cathedral
of
Barchester
also
,
against
one
Geoffrey
De
Burgh
,
in
the
time
of
King
John
;
and
Mr.
Thorne
possess
the
whole
history
of
the
siege
write
on
vellum
and
illuminate
in
a
most
costly
manner
.
<EOS>
It
little
signify
that
no
one
could
read
the
writing
,
as
,
have
that
be
possible
,
no
one
could
have
understand
the
language
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
could
,
however
,
give
you
all
the
particular
in
good
English
,
and
have
no
objection
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
unjust
to
say
that
he
look
down
on
man
whose
family
be
of
recent
date
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
frequently
consort
with
such
,
and
have
choose
many
of
his
friend
from
among
them
.
<EOS>
but
he
look
on
them
as
great
millionaire
be
apt
to
look
on
those
who
have
small
income
;
as
man
who
have
sophocle
at
their
finger
"
end
regard
those
who
know
nothing
of
Greek
.
<EOS>
They
may
doubtless
be
good
sort
of
people
,
entitle
to
much
praise
for
virtue
,
very
admirable
for
talent
,
highly
respectable
in
every
way
,
but
they
be
without
the
one
great
good
gift
.
<EOS>
such
be
Mr.
Thorne
's
way
of
thinking
on
this
matter
<EOS>
;
nothing
could
atone
for
the
loss
of
good
blood
;
nothing
could
neutralize
its
good
effect
.
<EOS>
few
indeed
be
now
possess
of
it
,
but
the
possession
be
on
that
account
the
more
precious
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
pleasant
to
hear
Mr.
Thorne
descant
on
this
matter
.
<EOS>
be
you
in
your
ignorance
to
surmise
that
such
a
one
be
of
a
good
family
because
the
head
of
his
family
be
a
baronet
of
an
old
date
,
he
would
open
his
eye
with
a
delightful
look
of
affected
surprise
,
and
modestly
remind
you
that
baronetcie
only
date
from
James
I.
<EOS>
He
would
gently
sigh
if
you
speak
of
the
blood
of
the
Fitzgeralds
and
De
Burghs
;
would
hardly
allow
the
claim
of
the
Howards
and
Lowthers
;
and
have
before
now
allude
to
the
Talbots
as
a
family
who
have
hardly
yet
achieve
the
full
honour
of
a
pedigree
.
  
<EOS>
in
speak
once
of
a
wide
-
spread
race
whose
name
have
receive
the
honour
of
three
coronet
,
scion
from
which
sit
for
various
constituency
,
some
one
of
whose
member
have
be
in
almost
every
cabinet
form
during
the
present
century
,
a
brilliant
race
such
as
there
be
few
in
England
,
Mr.
Thorne
have
call
them
all
"
dirt
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
not
intend
any
disrespect
to
these
man
.
<EOS>
He
admire
them
in
many
sense
,
and
allow
them
their
privilege
without
envy
.
<EOS>
He
have
merely
mean
to
express
his
feeling
that
the
stream
which
run
through
their
vein
be
not
yet
purify
by
time
to
that
perfection
,
have
not
become
so
genuine
an
ichor
,
as
to
be
worthy
of
be
call
blood
in
the
genealogical
sense
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Arabin
be
first
introduce
to
him
,
Mr.
Thorne
have
immediately
suggest
that
he
be
one
of
the
Arabins
of
Uphill
Stanton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
reply
that
he
be
a
very
distant
relative
of
the
family
allude
to
.
<EOS>
to
this
Mr.
Thorne
surmise
that
the
relationship
could
not
be
very
distant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
assure
him
that
it
be
so
distant
that
the
family
know
nothing
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
laugh
his
gentle
laugh
at
this
and
tell
Mr.
Arabin
that
there
be
now
exist
no
branch
of
his
family
separate
from
the
parent
stock
at
an
early
date
than
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
,
and
that
therefore
Mr.
Arabin
could
not
call
himself
distant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
himself
be
quite
clearly
an
Arabin
of
Uphill
Stanton
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
the
vicar
,
"
Uphill
Stanton
have
be
sell
to
the
De
Greys
and
have
be
in
their
hand
for
the
last
fifty
year

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
when
it
have
be
there
one
hundred
and
fifty
,
if
it
unluckily
remain
there
so
long
,
"
say
Mr.
Thorne
,
"
your
descendant
will
not
be
a
whit
the
less
entitled
to
describe
themselves
as
be
of
the
family
of
Uphill
Stanton

<EOS>
thank
God
no
De
Grey
can
buy
that
 
and
thank
God
no
Arabin
,
and
no
Thorne

can
sell
it

"
  
<EOS>
in
politic
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
be
an
unflinching
conservative
.
<EOS>
He
look
on
those
fifty
-
three
Trojans
who
,
as
Mr.
Dod
tell
us
,
censure
free
trade
in
November
,
1852
,
as
the
only
patriot
leave
among
the
public
man
of
England
.
<EOS>
when
that
terrible
crisis
of
free
trade
have
arrive
,
when
the
repeal
of
the
Corn
Laws
be
carry
by
those
very
man
whom
Mr.
Thorne
have
hitherto
regard
as
the
only
possible
saviour
of
his
country
,
he
be
for
a
time
paralysed
.
<EOS>
His
country
be
lose
;
but
that
be
comparatively
a
small
thing
.
<EOS>
other
country
have
flourish
and
fall
,
and
the
human
race
still
go
on
improve
under
God
's
providence
.
<EOS>
but
now
all
trust
in
human
faith
must
forever
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
not
only
must
ruin
come
,
but
it
must
come
through
the
apostasy
of
those
who
have
be
regard
as
the
true
of
true
believer
.
<EOS>
politic
in
England
,
as
a
pursuit
for
gentleman
,
must
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Thorne
be
trodden
under
foot
by
a
Whig
,
he
could
have
bear
it
as
a
Tory
and
a
martyr
,
but
to
be
so
utterly
throw
over
and
deceive
by
those
he
have
so
earnestly
support
,
so
thoroughly
trust
,
be
more
than
he
could
endure
and
live
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
cease
to
live
as
a
politician
,
and
refuse
to
hold
any
converse
with
the
world
at
large
on
the
state
of

<EOS>
such
be
Mr.
Thorne
's
impression
for
the
first
two
or
three
year
after
Sir
Robert
Peel
's
apostasy
,
but
by
degree
his
temper
,
as
do
that
of
other
,
cool
down
.
<EOS>
He
begin
once
more
to
move
about
,
to
frequent
the
bench
and
the
market
,
and
to
be
see
at
dinner
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
some
of
those
who
have
so
cruelly
betrayed
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
necessity
for
him
to
live
,
and
that
plan
of
his
for
avoid
the
world
do
not
answer
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
and
other
around
him
who
still
maintain
the
same
staunch
principle
of
protection
 
man
like
himself
who
be
too
true
to
flinch
at
the
cry
of
a
mob
 
have
their
own
way
of
console
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
and
feel
themselves
to
be
,
the
only
true
depositary
leave
of
certain
eleusinian
mystery
,
of
certain
deep
and
wondrous
service
of
worship
by
which
alone
the
god
could
be
rightly
approach
.
<EOS>
to
them
and
them
only
be
it
now
give
to
know
these
thing
and
to
perpetuate
them
,
if
that
may
still
be
do
,
by
the
careful
and
secret
education
of
their
child
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
read
how
private
and
peculiar
form
of
worship
have
be
carry
on
from
age
to
age
in
family
which
,
to
the
outer
world
,
have
apparently
adhere
to
the
service
of
some
ordinary
church
.
<EOS>
and
so
by
degree
it
be
with
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
He
learn
at
length
to
listen
calmly
while
protection
be
talk
of
as
a
thing
dead
,
although
he
know
within
himself
that
it
be
still
quick
with
a
mystic
life
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
without
a
certain
pleasure
that
such
knowledge
,
though
give
to
him
,
should
be
debar
from
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
He
become
accustomed
to
hear
even
among
country
gentleman
that
free
trade
be
after
all
not
so
bad
,
and
to
hear
this
without
dispute
,
although
conscious
within
himself
that
everything
good
in
England
have
go
with
his
old
palladium
.
<EOS>
He
have
within
him
something
of
the
feeling
of
Cato
,
who
glory
that
he
could
kill
himself
because
Romans
be
no
longer
worthy
of
their
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
have
no
thought
of
kill
himself
,
be
a
Christian
and
still
possess
his
£
4000
a
year
,
but
the
feeling
be
not
on
that
account
the
less
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
be
a
sportsman
,
and
have
be
active
though
not
outrageous
in
his
sport
.
<EOS>
previous
to
the
great
downfall
of
politic
in
his
county
,
he
have
support
the
hunt
by
every
mean
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
He
have
preserve
game
till
no
goose
or
turkey
could
show
a
tail
in
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
plant
gorse
cover
with
more
care
than
oak
and
larch
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
more
anxious
for
the
comfort
of
his
fox
than
of
his
ewes
and
lamb
.
<EOS>
no
meet
have
be
more
popular
than
Ullathorne
;
no
man
's
stable
have
be
more
liberally
open
to
the
horse
of
distant
man
than
Mr.
Thorne
's
;
no
man
have
say
more
,
write
more
,
or
do
more
to
keep
the
club
up
.
<EOS>
the
theory
of
protection
could
expand
itself
so
thoroughly
in
the
practice
of
a
county
hunt
!
<EOS>
but
when
the
great
ruin
come
;
when
the
noble
master
of
the
Barsetshire
hound
support
the
recreant
minister
in
the
House
of
Lords
and
basely
surrender
his
truth
,
his
manhood
,
his
friend
,
and
his
honour
for
the
hope
of
a
garter
,
then
Mr.
Thorne
give
up
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
cut
his
cover
,
for
that
would
not
have
be
the
act
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
kill
his
fox
,
for
that
accord
to
his
light
would
have
be
murder
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
say
that
his
cover
should
not
be
draw
,
or
his
earth
stop
,
for
that
would
have
be
illegal
accord
to
the
by
-
law
prevail
among
country
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
he
absent
himself
from
home
on
the
occasion
of
every
meet
at
Ullathorne
,
leave
the
cover
to
their
fate
,
and
could
not
be
persuade
to
take
his
pink
coat
out
of
his
press
,
or
his
hunter
out
of
his
stable
.
<EOS>
this
last
for
two
year
,
and
then
by
degree
he
come
round
.
<EOS>
He
first
appear
at
a
neighbouring
meet
on
a
pony
,
dress
in
his
shooting
-
coat
,
as
though
he
have
trot
in
by
accident
;
then
he
walk
up
one
morning
on
foot
to
see
his
favourite
gorse
draw
,
and
when
his
groom
bring
his
mare
out
by
chance
,
he
do
not
refuse
to
mount
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
next
persuade
,
by
one
of
the
immortal
fifty
-
three
,
to
bring
his
hunting
material
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
county
and
take
a
fortnight
with
the
hound
there
;
and
so
gradually
he
return
to
his
old
life
.
<EOS>
but
in
hunting
as
in
other
thing
he
be
only
support
by
an
inward
feeling
of
mystic
superiority
to
those
with
whom
he
share
the
common
breath
of
outer
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
do
not
live
in
solitude
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
sister
,
who
be
ten
year
old
than
himself
and
who
participate
in
his
prejudice
and
feeling
so
strongly
that
she
be
a
live
caricature
of
all
his
foible
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
open
a
modern
quarterly
,
do
not
choose
to
see
a
magazine
in
her
drawing
-
room
,
and
would
not
have
pollute
her
finger
with
a
shred
of
the
Times
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
Addison
,
Swift
,
and
Steele
as
though
they
be
still
live
,
regard
Defoe
as
the
best
know
novelist
of
his
country
,
and
think
of
field
as
a
young
but
meritorious
novice
in
the
field
of
romance
.
<EOS>
in
poetry
,
she
be
familiar
with
name
as
late
as
Dryden
,
and
have
once
be
seduce
into
reading
"
the
Rape
of
the
Lock
;
"
but
she
regard
Spenser
as
the
pure
type
of
her
country
's
literature
in
this
line
.
<EOS>
genealogy
be
her
favourite
insanity
.
<EOS>
those
thing
which
be
the
pride
of
most
genealogist
be
to
her
contemptible
.
<EOS>
arm
and
motto
set
her
beside
herself
.
<EOS>
ealfrie
of
Ullathorne
have
want
no
motto
to
assist
him
in
cleave
to
the
brisket
Geoffrey
De
Burgh
,
and
Ealfried
's
great
grandfather
,
the
gigantic
Ullafrid
,
have
require
no
other
arm
than
those
which
nature
give
him
to
hurl
from
the
top
of
his
own
castle
a
cousin
of
the
base
invade
Norman
.
<EOS>
to
her
all
modern
english
name
be
equally
insignificant
:
<EOS>
hengist
,
Horsa
,
and
such
like
have
for
her
ear
the
only
true
savour
of
nobility
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
content
unless
she
could
go
beyond
the
Saxons
,
and
would
certainly
have
christen
her
child
,
have
she
have
child
,
by
the
name
of
the
ancient
briton
.
<EOS>
in
some
respect
she
be
not
unlike
Scott
's
Ulrica
,
and
have
she
be
give
to
cursing
,
she
would
certainly
have
do
so
in
the
name
of
Mista
,
Skogula
,
and
Zernebock
.
<EOS>
not
have
submit
to
the
embrace
of
any
pollute
Norman
,
as
poor
Ulrica
have
do
,
and
have
assist
no
parricide
,
the
milk
of
human
kindness
be
not
curdle
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
never
curse
therefore
,
but
bless
rather
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
she
do
in
a
strange
uncouth
Saxon
manner
that
would
have
be
unintelligible
to
any
peasant
but
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
politician
,
Miss
Thorne
have
be
so
thoroughly
disgust
with
public
life
by
base
deed
long
antecedent
to
the
Corn
Law
question
that
that
have
but
little
moved
her
.
<EOS>
in
her
estimation
her
brother
have
be
a
fast
young
man
,
hurry
away
by
a
too
ardent
temperament
into
democratic
tendency
.
<EOS>
now
happily
he
be
bring
to
sounder
view
by
see
the
iniquity
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
reconcile
herself
to
the
Reform
Bill
,
and
still
groan
in
spirit
over
the
defalcation
of
the
Duke
as
touch
the
Catholic
Emancipation
.
<EOS>
if
ask
whom
she
think
the
Queen
should
take
as
her
counsellor
,
she
would
probably
have
name
Lord
Eldon
,
and
when
remind
that
that
venerable
man
be
no
longer
present
in
the
flesh
to
assist
us
,
she
would
probably
have
answer
with
a
sigh
that
none
now
could
help
us
but
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
in
religion
Miss
Thorne
be
a
pure
druidess
.
<EOS>
We
would
not
have
it
understand
by
that
<EOS>
that
she
do
actually
in
these
latter
day
assist
at
any
human
sacrifice
,
or
that
she
be
in
fact
hostile
to
the
Church
of
Christ
.
<EOS>
She
have
adopt
the
christian
religion
as
a
milder
form
of
the
worship
of
her
ancestor
,
and
always
appeal
to
her
do
so
as
evidence
that
she
have
no
prejudice
against
reform
,
when
it
could
be
show
that
reform
be
salutary
.
<EOS>
this
reform
be
the
most
modern
of
any
to
which
she
have
as
yet
accede
,
it
be
presume
that
british
lady
have
give
up
their
paint
and
take
to
some
sort
of
petticoat
before
the
day
of
St.
Augustine
.
<EOS>
that
further
feminine
step
in
advance
which
combine
paint
and
petticoat
together
have
not
find
a
votary
in
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
druidess
in
this
,
that
she
regret
she
know
not
what
in
the
usage
and
practice
of
her
Church
.
<EOS>
She
sometimes
talk
and
constantly
think
of
good
thing
go
by
,
though
she
have
but
the
faint
idea
of
what
those
good
thing
have
be
.
<EOS>
She
imagine
that
a
purity
have
exist
which
be
now
go
,
that
a
piety
have
adorn
our
pastor
and
a
simple
docility
our
people
,
for
which
it
may
be
fear
history
give
her
but
little
true
warrant
.
<EOS>
She
be
accustomed
to
speak
of
Cranmer
as
though
he
have
be
the
firm
and
most
simple
-
minded
of
martyr
,
and
of
Elizabeth
as
though
the
pure
protestant
faith
of
her
people
have
be
the
one
anxiety
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
cruel
to
undeceive
her
,
have
it
be
possible
;
but
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
make
her
believe
that
the
one
be
a
time
-
serve
priest
,
willing
to
go
any
length
to
keep
his
place
,
and
that
the
other
be
in
heart
a
papist
,
with
this
sole
proviso
,
that
she
should
be
her
own
pope
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Miss
Thorne
go
on
sighing
and
regretting
,
look
back
to
the
divine
right
of
king
as
the
ruling
axiom
of
a
golden
age
,
and
cherish
,
low
down
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
of
heart
,
a
dear
unmentioned
wish
for
the
restoration
of
some
exile
Stuart
.
<EOS>
who
would
deny
her
the
luxury
of
her
sigh
,
or
the
sweetness
of
her
soft
regret
!
  
<EOS>
in
her
person
and
her
dress
she
be
perfect
,
and
well
she
know
her
own
perfection
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
small
,
elegantly
make
old
woman
,
with
a
face
from
which
the
glow
of
her
youth
have
not
depart
without
leave
some
streak
of
a
roseate
hue
.
<EOS>
She
be
proud
of
her
colour
,
proud
of
her
grey
hair
which
she
wear
in
short
crisp
curl
peer
out
all
around
her
face
from
her
dainty
white
lace
cap
.
<EOS>
to
think
of
all
the
money
that
she
spend
in
lace
use
to
break
the
heart
of
poor
Mrs.
Quiverful
with
her
seven
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
be
proud
of
her
tooth
,
which
be
still
white
and
numerous
,
proud
of
her
bright
cheery
eye
,
proud
of
her
short
jaunty
step
;
and
very
proud
of
the
neat
,
precise
,
small
foot
with
which
those
step
be
take
.
<EOS>
She
be
proud
also
,
ay
,
very
proud
,
of
the
rich
brocaded
silk
in
which
it
be
her
custom
to
ruffle
through
her
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
what
be
the
custom
of
the
lady
of
Branksome
    
nine
-
and
-
twenty
knight
of
fame
hang
their
shield
in
Branksome
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
of
Ullathorne
be
not
so
martial
in
her
habit
,
but
hardly
less
costly
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
boast
that
nine
-
and
-
twenty
silken
skirt
may
have
be
produce
in
her
chamber
,
each
fit
to
stand
alone
.
<EOS>
the
nine
-
and
-
twenty
shield
of
the
scottish
hero
be
less
independent
and
hardly
more
potent
to
withstand
any
attack
that
may
be
make
on
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
when
fully
dress
may
be
say
to
have
be
armed
cap
-
a
-
pie
,
and
she
be
always
fully
dress
,
as
far
as
be
ever
know
to
mortal
man
.
  
<EOS>
for
all
this
rich
attire
Miss
Thorne
be
not
indebted
to
the
generosity
of
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
very
comfortable
independence
of
her
own
,
which
she
divide
among
juvenile
relative
,
the
milliner
,
and
the
poor
,
give
much
the
large
share
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagine
,
therefore
,
that
with
all
her
little
folly
she
be
not
unpopular
.
<EOS>
all
her
folly
have
,
we
believe
,
be
tell
.
<EOS>
Her
virtue
be
too
numerous
to
describe
,
and
not
sufficiently
interesting
to
deserve
description
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
on
the
subject
of
the
Thornes
,
one
word
must
be
say
of
the
house
they
live
in
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
large
house
,
nor
a
fine
house
,
nor
perhaps
to
modern
idea
a
very
commodious
house
,
but
by
those
who
love
the
peculiar
colour
and
peculiar
ornament
of
genuine
Tudor
architecture
it
be
consider
a
perfect
gem
.
<EOS>
We
beg
to
own
ourselves
among
the
number
,
and
therefore
take
this
opportunity
to
express
our
surprise
that
so
little
be
know
by
english
man
and
woman
of
the
beauty
of
english
architecture
.
<EOS>
the
ruin
of
the
Colosseum
,
the
Campanile
at
Florence
,
<EOS>
St.
Mark
's
,
Cologne
,
the
Bourse
and
Notre
Dame
be
with
our
tourist
as
familiar
as
household
word
;
but
they
know
nothing
of
the
glory
of
Wiltshire
,
Dorsetshire
,
and
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
nay
,
we
much
question
whether
many
note
traveller
,
man
who
have
pitch
their
tent
perhaps
under
Mount
Sinai
,
be
not
still
ignorant
that
there
be
glory
in
Wiltshire
,
dorsetshire
,
and
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
We
beg
that
they
will
go
and
see
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
's
house
be
call
Ullathorne
Court
 
and
be
properly
so
call
,
for
the
house

form
two

of
a
quadrangle

which
be
complete
on
the
other

a
wall
about
twenty
foot
high

<EOS>
this
wall

rudely
cut

and
now

of
a
beautiful

rich

tawny
yellow
colour
,
the
effect
of
that
stonecrop
of
minute
growth
which
it
have
take
three
century
to
produce
.
<EOS>
the
top
of
this
wall
be
ornament
by
huge
,
round
stone
ball
of
the
same
colour
as
the
wall
itself
.
<EOS>
entrance
into
the
court
be
have
through
a
pair
of
iron
gate
so
massive
that
no
one
could
comfortably
open
or
close
them
 
consequently
,
they
be
rarely
disturb
.
<EOS>
from
the
gateway
two
path
lead
obliquely
across
the
court
:
<EOS>
that

which

lead
to
the
back
entrance
,
which
be
at
the
further
end
of
the
long
portion
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
with
those
who
be
now
adept
in
contrive
house
accommodation
,
it
will
militate
much
against
Ullathorne
Court
that
no
carriage
could
be
bring
to
the
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
if
you
enter
Ullathorne
at
all
,
you
must
do
so
,
fair
reader
,
on
foot
,
or
at
least
in
a
bath
-
chair
.
<EOS>
no
vehicle
draw
by
horse
ever
come
within
that
iron
gate
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
nothing
to
the
next
horror
that
will
encounter
you
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
front
door
,
which
you
do
by
no
very
grand
portal
,
you
find
yourself
immediately
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
what
,
no
hall
?
<EOS>
exclaim
my
luxurious
friend
,
accustom
to
all
the
comfortable
appurtenance
of
modern
life
.
<EOS>
yes
,
kind
sir
,
a
noble
hall
,
if
you
will
but
observe
it
;
a
true
old
english
hall
of
excellent
dimension
for
a
country
gentleman
's
family
;
but
,
if
you
please
,
no
dining
-
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
both
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
be
proud
of
this
peculiarity
of
their
dwelling
,
though
the
brother
be
once
all
but
tempt
by
his
friend
to
alter
it
.
<EOS>
They
delight
in
the
knowledge
that
they
,
like
Cedric
,
positively
dine
in
their
true
hall
,
even
though
they
so
dine
_
tête
-
à

tête
_
.
<EOS>
but
though
they
have
never
own
,
they
have
feel
and
endeavour
to
remedy
the
discomfort
of
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
a
huge
screen
partition
off
the
front
door
and
a
portion
of
the
hall
,
and
from
the
angle
so
screen
off
a
second
door
lead
into
a
passage
which
run
along
the
large
side
of
the
house
next
to
the
courtyard
.
<EOS>
either
my
reader
or
I
must
be
a
bad
hand
at
topography
,
if
it
be
not
clear
that
the
great
hall
form
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
small
portion
of
the
mansion
,
that
which
be
to
your
left
as
you
enter
the
iron
gate
,
and
that
it
occupy
the
whole
of
this
wing
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
equally
clear
that
it
look
out
on
a
trim
mown
lawn
,
through
three
quadrangular
window
with
stone
mullion
,
each
window
divide
into
a
large
portion
at
the
bottom
,
and
a
small
portion
at
the
top
,
and
each
portion
again
divide
into
five
by
perpendicular
stone
supporter
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
window
which
give
a
well
light
than
such
as
these
,
and
it
may
be
,
as
my
utilitarian
friend
observe
,
that
the
giving
of
light
be
the
desire
object
of
a
window
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
argue
the
point
with
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
the
less
die
in
the
assured
conviction
that
no
sort
or
description
of
window
be
capable
of
impart
half
so
much
happiness
to
mankind
as
that
which
have
be
adopt
at
Ullathorne
Court
.
<EOS>
what
,
not
an
oriel
?
<EOS>
say
Miss
Diana

Midellage
.
<EOS>
no
,
Miss
Diana
,
not
even
an
oriel
,
beautiful
as
be
an
oriel
window
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
about
it
<EOS>
so
perfect
a
feeling
of
quiet
English
homely
comfort
.
<EOS>
let
oriel
window
grace
a
college
,
or
the
half
-
public
mansion
of
a
potent
peer
,
but
for
the
sit
room
of
quiet
country
lady
,
of
ordinary
homely
folk
,
nothing
can
equal
the
square
,
mullione
window
of
the
Tudor
architect

<EOS>
the

in

<EOS>
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
be
a
huge
fire
-
place
,
which
afford
much
ground
of
difference
between
the
brother
and

<EOS>
an
antiquated
grate
that
would
hold
about
a
hundredweight
of
coal
,
have
be
stick
on
to
the
hearth
by
Mr.
Thorne
's
father

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
Miss

be

<EOS>
the

good
old
creature
be
always
glad
to

and
have
she

indulge
,
would
doubtless
in

have
reflect
that
finger
be
make
before
fork
and
have
revert
accordingly
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
affair
of
the
fire

place
Mr.
Thorne
would
not
revert
.
<EOS>
country
gentleman
around
him
all
have
comfortable

<EOS>
He
be
not
exactly
the
man
to
have
suggest
a
modern
usage
,
but
he
be
not
so
far
prejudice
as
to
banish
those
which
his
father
have
prepare
for
his
use
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
have
indeed
once
suggest
that
with
very
little
contrivance
the
front
door
may
have
be
so
alter
as
to
open
at
least
into
the
passage
,
but
on
hear
this
,
his
sister
Monica
 
such
be
Miss
Thorne

have
be
take
ill
and
have
remain
so
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
before
she
come
downstairs
she
receive
a
pledge
from
her
brother
that
the

should
never

<EOS>
at
the

into
the
drawing

room
,
which
be
of
equal
size

and
light
with
precisely
similar
window

<EOS>
but
yet
the
aspect
of
the
room
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
It
be
paper

and
the
ceiling
,
which
in
the
hall
show
the
old
rafter
,
be
whiten
and
finish
with
a

cornice
.
<EOS>
Miss

's
drawing

room
,
or
,
as
she
always
call
it
,
withdraw

,
be
a
beautiful
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
window
open
on
to
the
full
extent
of
the
lovely
trim
garden
;
immediately
before
the

be
plot
of
flower
in
stiff

stately
,
stubborn
little
bed
,
each

surround
by
a
stone

of
its

beyond

there
be
a
low
parapet
wall
on
which
stand
urn
and
image
,
fawn
,
nymphs
,
satyrs
,
and
a
whole

again
,
beyond

a

slope
away
to
a

which

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
door
open
into
both
Miss

and
Mr.

sanctum
from
the
passage
above
allude
to
,
which
,
as
it
come
to
the
latter
room
,
widen
itself
so
as
to
make
space
for
the
huge
black
oak
stair
which
lead
to
the
upper
region
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
interior
of
Ullathorne
Court
.
<EOS>
but
have
thus
describe
it
,
perhaps
somewhat
too
tediously
,
we
beg
to
say
that
it
be
not
the
interior
to
which
we
wish
to
call
the
English
tourist
's
attention
,
though
we
advise
him
to
lose
no
legitimate
opportunity
of
become
acquaint
with
it
in
a
friendly
manner
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
outside
of
Ullathorne
that
be
so
lovely
.
<EOS>
let
the
tourist
get
admission
at
least
into
the
garden
and
fling
himself
on
that
soft
sward
just
opposite
to
the
exterior
angle
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
will
there
get
the
double
frontage
and
enjoy
that
which
be
so
lovely
 
<EOS>
the
expanse
of
architectural
beauty
without
the
formal
dullness
of
one
long
line
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
colour
of
Ullathorne
that
be
so
remarkable
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
that
delicious
tawny
hue
which
no
stone
can
give
,
unless
it
have
on
it
the
vegetable
richness
of
century
.
<EOS>
strike
the
wall
with
your
hand
,
and
you
will
think
that
the
stone
have
on
it
no
covering
,
but
rub
it
carefully
,
and
you
will
find
that
the
colour
come
off
upon
your
finger
.
<EOS>
no
colourist
that
ever
yet
work
from
a
palette
have
be
able
to
come
up
to
this
rich
colouring
of
year
crowd
themselves
on
year
.
  
<EOS>
Ullathorne
be
a
high
building
for
a
country
-
house
,
for
it
possess
three
story
,
and
in
each
story
the
window
be
of
the
same
sort
as
that
describe
,
though
vary
in
size
and
varying
also
in
their
line
athwart
the
house
.
<EOS>
those
of
the
ground
floor
be
all
uniform
in
size
and
position
.
<EOS>
but
those
above
be
irregular
both
in
size
and
place
,
and
this
irregularity
give
a
bizarre
and
not
unpicturesque
appearance
to
the
building
.
<EOS>
along
the
top
,
on
every
side
,
run
a
low
parapet
,
which
nearly
hide
the
roof
,
and
at
the
corner
be
more
figure
of
fawn
and
satyrs
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Ullathorne
House
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
say
one
word
of
the
approach
to
it
,
which
shall
include
all
the
description
which
we
mean
to
give
of
the
church
also
.
<EOS>
the
picturesque
old
church
of
St.
Ewold
's
stand
immediately
opposite
to
the
iron
gate
which
open
into
the
court
,
and
be
all
but
surround
by
the
branch
of
the
lime
-
tree
which
form
the
avenue
lead
up
to
the
house
from
both
side
.
<EOS>
this
avenue
be
magnificent
,
but
it
would
lose
much
of
its
value
in
the
eye
of
many
proprietor
by
the
fact
that
the
road
through
it
be
not
private
property
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
public
lane
between
hedgerow
,
with
a
broad
grass
margin
on
each
side
of
the
road
,
from
which
the
lime
-
tree
spring
.
<EOS>
Ullathorne
Court
,
therefore
,
do
not
stand
absolutely
surround
by
its
own
ground
,
though
Mr.
Thorne
be
owner
of
all
the
adjacent
land
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
the
source
of
very
little
annoyance
to
him
.
<EOS>
man
,
when
they
be
acquire
property
,
think
much
of
such
thing
,
but
they
who
live
where
their
ancestor
have
live
for
year
do
not
feel
the
misfortune
.
<EOS>
It
never
occur
either
to
Mr.
or
Miss
Thorne
that
they
be
not
sufficiently
private
because
the
world
at
large
might
,
if
it
so
wish
,
walk
or
drive
by
their
iron
gate
.
<EOS>
that
part
of
the
world
which
avail
itself
of
the
privilege
be
however
very
small
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
year
or
two
since
be
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
such
,
we
believe
,
be
the
inhabitant
of
many
an
english
country
-
home
.
<EOS>
May
it
be
long
before
their
number
diminishe
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
read
Himself
in
at
St.
Ewold
's
 
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
morning
the
archdeacon
with
his
sister
-
in
-
law
and
Mr.
Arabin
drive
over
to
Ullathorne
,
as
have
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
on
their
way
thither
the
new
vicar
declare
himself
to
be
considerably
disturb
in
his
mind
at
the
idea
of
thus
face
his
parishioner
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
he
say
,
be
always
subject
to
_
mauvaise
honte
_
and
an
annoying
degree
of
bashfulness
,
which
often
unfit
him
for
any
work
of
a
novel
description
;
and
now
he
feel
this
so
strongly
that
he
fear
he
should
acquit
himself
badly
in
St.
Ewold
's
reading
-
desk
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
he
say
,
that
those
sharp
little
eye
of
Miss
Thorne
would
be
on
him
,
and
that
they
would
not
approve
.
<EOS>
all
this
the
archdeacon
greatly
ridicule
.
<EOS>
He
himself
know
not
,
and
have
never
know
,
what
it
be
to
be
shy
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
conceive
that
Miss
Thorne
,
surround
as
she
would
be
by
the
peasant
of
Ullathorne
and
a
few
of
the
poor
inhabitant
of
the
suburb
of
Barchester
,
could
in
any
way
affect
the
composure
of
a
man
well
accustomed
to
address
the
learn
congregation
of
St.
Mary
's
at
Oxford
,
and
he
laugh
accordingly
at
the
idea
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
modesty
.
  
<EOS>
thereupon
Mr.
Arabin
commence
to
subtilize
.
<EOS>
the
change
,
he
say
,
from
St.
Mary
's
to
St.
Ewold
's
be
quite
as
powerful
on
the
spirit
as
would
be
that
from
St.
Ewold
's
to
St.
Mary
's
.
<EOS>
Would
not
a
peer
who
,
by
chance
of
fortune
,
may
suddenly
be
drive
to
herd
among
navvy
be
as
afraid
of
the
jeer
of
his
companion
as
would
any
navvy
suddenly
exalt
to
a
seat
among
the
peer
?
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
archdeacon
declare
with
a
loud
laugh
that
he
would
tell
Miss
Thorne
that
her
new
minister
have
liken
her
to
a
navvy
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
pronounce
such
a
conclusion
to
be
unfair
;
a
comparison
may
be
very
just
in
its
proportion
which
do
not
at
all
assimilate
the
thing
compare
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Arabin
go
on
subtilizing
,
regard
neither
the
archdeacon
's
raillery
nor
Eleanor
's
defence
.
<EOS>
a
young
lady
,
he
say
,
would
execute
with
most
perfect
self
-
possession
a
difficult
piece
of
music
in
a
room
crowd
with
stranger
,
who
would
not
be
able
to
express
herself
in
intelligible
language
,
even
on
any
ordinary
subject
and
among
her
most
intimate
friend
,
if
she
be
require
to
do
so
stand
on
a
box
somewhat
elevated
among
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
an
affair
of
education
,
and
he
at
forty
find
it
difficult
to
educate
himself
anew
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
dissent
on
the
matter
of
the
box
,
and
aver
she
could
speak
very
well
about
dress
,
or
baby
,
or
leg
of
mutton
from
any
box
,
<EOS>
provide
it
be
big
enough
for
her
to
stand
upon
without
fear
,
even
though
all
her
friend
be
listen
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
sure
she
would
not
be
able
to
say
a
word
,
but
this
prove
nothing
in
favour
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
say
that
he
would
try
the
question
out
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
and
get
her
on
a
box
some
day
when
the
rectory
may
be
full
of
visitor
.
<EOS>
to
this
Eleanor
assent
,
make
condition
that
the
visitor
should
be
of
their
own
set
,
and
the
archdeacon
cogitate
in
his
mind
whether
by
such
a
condition
it
be
intend
that
Mr.
Slope
should
be
include
,
resolve
also
that
,
if
so
,
the
trial
would
certainly
never
take
place
in
the
rectory
drawing
-
room
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
argue
,
they
drive
up
to
the
iron
gate
of
Ullathorne
Court
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
be
stand
ready
dress
for
church
in
the
hall
,
and
greet
their
clerical
visitor
with
cordiality
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
an
old
favourite
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clergyman
of
the
old
school
,
and
this
recommend
him
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
be
an
opponent
of
free
trade
as
long
as
free
trade
be
an
open
question
,
and
now
that
it
be
no
longer
so
,
he
,
be
a
clergyman
,
have
not
be
oblige
,
like
most
of
his
lay
Tory
companion
,
to
read
his
recantation
.
<EOS>
He
could
therefore
be
regard
as
a
supporter
of
the
immaculate
fifty
-
three
,
and
be
on
this
account
a
favourite
with
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
the
little
bell
be
tinkle
,
and
the
rural
population
of
the
parish
be
stand
about
the
lane
,
lean
on
the
church
-
stile
and
against
the
wall
of
the
old
court
,
anxious
to
get
a
look
at
their
new
minister
as
he
pass
from
the
house
to
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
servant
have
already
precede
them
thither
with
the
vestment
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
go
forth
together
,
and
when
the
lady
pass
into
the
church
,
the
three
gentleman
tarry
a
moment
in
the
lane
,
that
Mr.
Thorne
may
name
to
the
vicar
with
some
kind
of
one
-
side
introduction
the
most
leading
among
his
parishioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
our
churchwarden
,
Mr.
Arabin
 
Farmer
Greenacre
and
Mr.
Stiles
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stiles
have
the
mill
as
you
go
into
Barchester
;
and
very
good
churchwarden
they
be
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
very
severe
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
the
two
ecclesiastical
officer
touch
their
hat
,
and
each
make
a
leg
in
the
approve
rural
fashion
,
assure
the
vicar
that
they
be
very
glad
to
have
the
honour
of
see
him
,
and
add
that
the
weather
be
very
good
for
the
harvest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stiles
,
be
a
man
somewhat
verse
in
town
life
,
have
an
impression
of
his
own
dignity
,
and
do
not
quite
like
leave
his
pastor
under
the
erroneous
idea
that
he
be
a
churchwarden
keep
the
child
in
order
during
church
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
understand
Mr.
Arabin
's
allusion
to
his
severity
and
hasten
to
put
matter
right
by
observe
that
"
Sexton
Clodheve
look
to
the
youngun
,
and
perhaps
sometimes
there
may
be
a
thought
too
much
stick
go
on
during
sermon
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
's
bright
eye
twinkle
as
he
catch
that
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
he
smile
to
himself
as
he
observe
how
ignorant
his
officer
be
of
the
nature
of
their
authority
and
of
the
surveillance
which
it
be
their
duty
to
keep
even
over
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
read
the
lesson
and
preach
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
put
a
man
a
little
out
,
let
him
have
be
ever
so
use
to
pulpit
reading
,
to
see
the
know
way
in
which
the
farmer
cock
their
ear
and
set
about
a
mental
criticism
as
to
whether
their
new
minister
do
or
do
not
fall
short
of
the
excellence
of
him
who
have
lately
depart
from
them
.
<EOS>
a
mental
and
silent
criticism
it
be
for
the
exist
moment
,
but
soon
to
be
make
public
among
the
elder
of
St.
Ewold
's
over
the
green
grave
of
their
child
and
forefather
.
<EOS>
the
excellence
,
however
,
of
poor
old
Mr.
Goodenough
have
not
be
wonderful
,
and
there
be
few
there
who
do
not
deem
that
Mr.
Arabin
do
his
work
sufficiently
well
,
in
spite
of
the
slightly
nervous
affliction
which
at
first
impede
him
,
and
which
nearly
drive
the
archdeacon
beside
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
sermon
be
the
thing
to
try
the
man
.
<EOS>
It
often
surprise
us
that
very
young
man
can
muster
courage
to
preach
for
the
first
time
to
a
strange
congregation
.
<EOS>
man
who
be
as
yet
but
little
more
than
boy
,
who
have
but
just
leave
what
indeed
we
may
not
call
a
school
,
but
a
seminary
intend
for
their
tuition
as
scholar
,
whose
thought
have
be
mostly
of
boat
,
cricket
,
and
wine
-
party
,
ascend
a
rostrum
high
above
the
head
of
the
submissive
crowd
,
not
that
they
may
read
God
's
word
to
those
below
,
but
that
they
may
preach
their
own
word
for
the
edification
of
their
hearer
.
<EOS>
It
seem
strange
to
us
that
they
be
not
stricken
dumb
by
the
new
and
awful
solemnity
of
their
position
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
be
I
,
just
turn
twenty
-
three
,
who
have
never
yet
pass
ten
thoughtful
day
since
the
power
of
thought
first
come
to
me
,
how
be
I
to
instruct
these
greybeard
who
,
with
the
weary
thinking
of
so
many
year
,
have
approach
so
near
the
grave
?
<EOS>
Can
I
teach
them
their
duty
?
<EOS>
Can
I
explain
to
them
that
which
I
so
imperfectly
understand
,
that
which
year
of
study
may
have
make
so
plain
to
them
?
<EOS>
have
my
newly
acquire
privilege
as
one
of
God
's
minister
impart
to
me
as
yet
any
fitness
for
the
wonderful
work
of
a
preacher
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
suppose
that
such
idea
do
occur
to
young
clergyman
,
and
yet
they
overcome
,
apparently
with
ease
,
this
difficulty
which
to
us
appear
to
be
all
but
insurmountable
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
be
subject
in
the
way
of
ordination
to
the
power
of
a
bishop
's
hand
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
there
be
in
them
something
that
sustain
the
spirit
and
banish
the
natural
modesty
of
youth
.
<EOS>
but
for
ourselves
we
must
own
that
the
deep
affection
which
Dominie
Sampson
feel
for
his
young
pupil
have
not
more
endear
him
to
us
than
the
bashful
spirit
which
send
him
mute
and
inglorious
from
the
pulpit
when
he
rise
there
with
the
futile
attempt
to
preach
God
's
gospel
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
rule
in
our
church
which
forbid
the
young
order
of
our
clergyman
to
perform
a
certain
portion
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
the
absolution
must
be
read
by
a
minister
in
priest
's
order
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
such
minister
present
,
the
congregation
can
have
the
benefit
of
no
absolution
but
that
which
each
may
succeed
in
administer
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
rule
may
be
a
good
one
,
though
the
necessity
for
it
hardly
come
home
to
the
general
understanding
.
<EOS>
but
this
forbearance
on
the
part
of
youth
would
be
much
more
appreciated
if
it
be
extend
likewise
to
sermon
.
<EOS>
the
only
danger
would
be
that
congregation
would
be
too
anxious
to
prevent
their
young
clergyman
from
advance
themselves
in
the
rank
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
clergyman
who
could
not
preach
would
be
such
blessing
that
they
would
be
bribe
to
adhere
to
their
incompetence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
however
,
have
not
the
modesty
of
youth
to
impede
him
,
and
he
succeed
with
his
sermon
even
better
than
with
the
lesson
.
<EOS>
He
take
for
his
text
two
verse
out
of
the
second
epistle
of
St.
John
,
"
Whosoever
transgresseth
,
and
abideth
not
in
the
doctrine
of
Christ
,
hath
not
God
.
<EOS>
He
that
abideth
in
the
doctrine
of
Christ
,
he
hath
both
the
Father
and
the
Son
.
<EOS>
if
there
come
any
unto
you
,
and
bring
not
this
doctrine
,
receive
him
not
into
your
house
,
neither
bid
him
God
-
speed
.
"
<EOS>
He
tell
them
that
the
house
of
theirs
to
which
he
allude
be
this
their
church
,
in
which
he
now
address
them
for
the
first
time
;
that
their
most
welcome
and
proper
manner
of
bid
him
God
-
speed
would
be
their
patient
obedience
to
his
teaching
of
the
gospel
;
but
that
he
could
put
forward
no
claim
to
such
conduct
on
their
part
unless
he
teach
them
the
great
christian
doctrine
of
work
and
faith
combine
.
<EOS>
on
this
he
enlarge
,
but
not
very
amply
,
and
after
twenty
minute
succeed
in
send
his
new
friend
home
to
their
bake
mutton
and
pudding
well
pleased
with
their
new
minister
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
lunch
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
in
the
hall
Miss
Thorne
take
Mr.
Arabin
's
hand
and
assure
him
that
she
receive
him
into
her
house
,
into
the
temple
,
she
say
,
in
which
she
worship
,
and
bade
him
God
-
speed
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
touch
and
squeeze
the
spinster
's
hand
without
utter
a
word
in
reply
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Thorne
express
a
hope
that
Mr.
Arabin
find
the
church
well
adapt
for
articulation
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
have
reply
that
he
have
no
doubt
he
should
as
soon
as
he
have
learn
to
pitch
his
voice
to
the
building
,
they
all
sit
down
to
the
good
thing
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
take
special
care
of
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
still
wear
her
widow
's
weed
,
and
therefore
have
about
her
that
air
of
grave
and
sad
maternity
which
be
the
lot
of
recent
widow
.
<EOS>
this
open
the
soft
heart
of
Miss
Thorne
,
and
make
her
look
on
her
young
guest
as
though
too
much
could
not
be
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
heap
chicken
and
ham
upon
her
plate
and
pour
out
for
her
a
full
bumper
of
port
wine
.
<EOS>
when
Eleanor
,
who
be
not
sorry
to
get
it
,
have
drink
a
little
of
it
,
Miss
Thorne
at
once
essay
to
fill
it
again
.
<EOS>
to
this
Eleanor
object
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
wink
and
nod
and
whisper
,
say
that
it
be
the
proper
thing
and
must
be
do
,
and
that
she
know
all
about
it
;
and
so
she
desire
Mrs.
Bold
to
drink
it
up
and
not
mind
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
duty
,
you
know
,
to
support
yourself
,
"
she
say
into
the
ear
of
the
young
mother
;
"
there
be
more
than
yourself
depend
on
it
;
"
and
thus
she
coshere
up
Eleanor
with
cold
fowl
and
port
wine
.
<EOS>
how
it
be
that
poor
man
's
wife
,
who
have
no
cold
fowl
and
port
wine
on
which
to
be
coshere
up
,
nurse
their
child
without
difficulty
,
whereas
the
wife
of
rich
man
,
who
eat
and
drink
everything
that
be
good
,
can
not
do
so
,
we
will
for
the
present
leave
to
the
doctor
and
the
mother
to
settle
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Miss
Thorne
be
great
about
tooth
.
<EOS>
little
Johnny
Bold
have
be
trouble
for
the
last
few
day
with
his
first
incipient
masticator
,
and
with
that
freemasonry
which
exist
among

,
Miss
Thorne
become
aware
of
the
fact
before
Eleanor
have
half
-
finish
her
wing
.
<EOS>
the
old
lady
prescribe
at
once
a
receipt
which
have
be
much
in
vogue
in
the
young
day
of
her
grandmother
,
and
warn
Eleanor
with
solemn
voice
against
the
fallacy
of
modern
medicine
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
his
coral
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
rub
it
well
with
carrot

juice
;
rub
it
till
the
juice
dry
on
it
,
and
then
give
it
him
to
play
with
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
get
a
coral
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
get
a
coral
!
"
say
Miss
Thorne
with
almost
angry
vehemence
.
<EOS>
"
not
get
a
coral
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
expect
that
he
should
cut
his
tooth
?
<EOS>
have
you
get
Daffy

Elixir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
explain
that
she
have
not

<EOS>
It
have
not
be
order
by
Mr.
Rerechild
,
the
Barchester
doctor
whom
she
employ
;
and
then
the
young
mother
mention
some
shockingly
modern
succedaneum
which
Mr.
Rerechild
's
new
light
have
teach
him
to
recommend
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
look
awfully
severe
.
"
<EOS>
take
care
,
my

"
say
she
,
"
that
the

take
care

not

your
little

and
she
soften
into
sorrow
,
as
she
say
it
,
and
speak
more
in
pity
than
in
anger
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
who
there
be
in
Barchester
now
that
you
can
trust

<EOS>
poor
dear
old
Doctor
Bumpwell

why

Miss

,
he
die
when
I
be
a
little
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
he
do
,
and
an
unfortunate
day
it
be
for
Barchester
.
<EOS>
as
to
those
young
man
that
have
come
up
since
"
 
Mr.
Rerechild
,
by
the
by
,
be
quite
as
old
as
Miss
Thorne
herself
 
"
one
do
not
know
where
they
come
from
or
who
they
be
,
or
whether
they
know
anything
about
their
business
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
be
very
clever
man
in
Barchester
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
there
may
be
;
only
I
do
not
know
them
:
and
it
be
admit
on
all
side
that
medical
man
be
not
now
what
they
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
use
to
be
talente
,
observe
,
educate
man
.
<EOS>
but
now
any
whipper
-
snapper
out
of
an
apothecary
's
shop
can
call
himself
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
believe
no
kind
of
education
be
now
think
necessary

"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
herself
the
widow
of
a
medical
man
and
feel
a
little
inclined
to
resent
all
these
hard
saying
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Thorne
be
so
essentially
good
-
natured
that
it
be
impossible
to
resent
anything
she
say
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
sip
her
wine
and
finish
her
chicken
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
my
dear
,
do
not
forget
the
carrot

juice

by
all
mean
get
him
a
coral
at
once

My

Thorne

bear
the
Barchester
doctor
.
<EOS>
even
poor
old
Dr.
Bumpwell
do
not
please
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
clearly
never
occur
to
Miss
Thorne
that
some
fifty
year
ago
Dr.
Bumpwell
be
only
a
rise
man
and
therefore
as
much
in
need
of
character
in
the
eye
of
the
then
lady
of
Ullathorne
as
the
present
doctor
be
in
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
make
a
very
good
lunch
,
and
talk
to
his
host
about
turnip
-
driller
and
new
machine
for
reaping
,
while
the
host
,
think
it
only
polite
to
attend
to
a
stranger
,
and
fear
that
perhaps
he
may
not
care
about
turnip
crop
on
a
Sunday
,
moot
all
manner
of
ecclesiastical
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
a
heavy
lot
of
wheat
,
Thorne
,
than
you
have
get
there
in
that
field
beyond
the
copse
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
be
guano
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
guano
.
<EOS>
I
get
it
from
Bristol
myself
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
you
often
have
a
tolerable
congregation
of
Barchester
people
out
here
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
fond
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
particularly
of
an
afternoon
when
the
weather
be
not
too
hot
for
the
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
under
an
obligation
to
them
for
stay
away
to
-
day
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
the
vicar
.
<EOS>
"
the
congregation
can
never
be
too
small
for
a
maiden
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
get
a
ton
and
a
half
at
Bradley
's
in
High
Street
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
"
and
it
be
a
complete
take
in
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
there
be
five
hundredweight
of
guano
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
Bradley
never
have
anything
good
,
"
say
Miss
Thorne
,
who
have
just
catch
the
name
during
her
whispering
with
Eleanor
.
"
<EOS>
and
such
a
nice
shop
as
there
use
to
be
in
that
very
house
before
he
come
.
<EOS>
Wilfred
<EOS>
,
do
not
you
remember
what
good
thing
<EOS>
old
Ambleoff
use
to
have
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
three
man
since
Ambleoff
's
time
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
"
and
each
as
bad
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
who
get
it
for
you
at
Bristol
,
Thorne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
run
up
myself
this
year
and
buy
it
out
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
as
the
evening
get
short
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
you
will
find
the
reading
-
desk
too
dark
.
<EOS>
I
must
send
a
fellow
with
an
axe
and
make
him
lop
off
some
of
those
branch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
declare
that
the
morning
light
at
any
rate
be
perfect
,
and
deprecate
any
interference
with
the
lime
-
tree
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
take
a
stroll
out
among
the
trim
parterre
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
explain
to
Mrs.
Bold
the
difference
between
a
naiad
and
a
dryad
,
and
dilate
on
vase
and
the
shape
of
urn
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
busy
herself
among
her
pansy
,
and
her
brother
,
find
it
quite
impracticable
to
give
anything
of
a
peculiarly
Sunday
tone
to
the
conversation
,
abandon
the
attempt
and
have
it
out
with
the
archdeacon
about
the
Bristol
guano
.
  
<EOS>
at
three
o'clock
they
again
go
into
church
,
and
now
Mr.
Arabin
read
the
service
and
the
archdeacon
preach
.
<EOS>
nearly
the
same
congregation
be
present
,
with
some
adventurous
pedestrian
from
the
city
,
who
have
not
think
the
heat
of
the
midday
August
sun
too
great
to
deter
them
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
take
his
text
from
the
epistle
to
Philemon
.
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
thee
for
my
son
Onesimus
,
whom
I
have
beget
in
my
bond
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
from
such
a
text
it
may
be
imagine
the
kind
of
sermon
which
Dr.
Grantly
preach
,
and
on
the
whole
it
be
neither
dull
,
nor
bad
,
nor
out
of
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
them
that
it
have
become
his
duty
to
look
about
for
a
pastor
for
them
,
to
supply
the
place
of
one
who
have
be
long
among
them
,
and
that
in
this
manner
he
regard
as
a
son
him
whom
he
have
select
,
as
St.
Paul
have
regard
the
young
disciple
whom
he
send
forth
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
a
little
merit
to
himself
for
have
studiously
provide
the
good
man
he
could
without
reference
to
patronage
or
favour
;
but
he
do
not
say
that
the
good
man
accord
to
his
view
be
he
who
be
best
able
to
subdue
Mr.
Slope
,
and
make
that
gentleman
's
situation
in
Barchester
too
hot
to
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
bond
,
they
have
consist
in
the
exceed
struggle
which
he
have
make
to
get
a
good
clergyman
for
them
.
<EOS>
He
deprecate
any
comparison
between
himself
and
St.
Paul
,
but
say
that
he
be
entitle
to
beseech
them
for
their
goodwill
towards
Mr.
Arabin
,
in
the
same
manner
that
the
apostle
have
beseech
Philemon
and
his
household
with
regard
to
Onesimus
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
sermon
 
text
,
blessing
,
and
all
 
be
conclude
within
the
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
then
they
shake
hand
with
their
ullathorne
friend
and
return
to
Plumstead
.
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
Mr.
Arabin
read
himself
in
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Manages
matter
very
cleverly
at
Puddingdale
 
<EOS>
the
next
two
week
pass
pleasantly
enough
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
the
whole
party
there
assemble
seem
to
get
on
well
together
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
make
the
house
agreeable
,
and
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Grantly
seem
to
have
forget
her
iniquity
as
regard
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
his
violoncello
,
and
play
to
them
while
his
daughter
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
Johnny
Bold
,
by
the
help
either
of
Mr.
Rerechild
or
else
by
that
of
his
coral
and
carrot
-
juice
,
get
through
his
teethe
trouble
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
gaiety
,
too
,
of
all
sort
.
<EOS>
They
have
dine
at
Ullathorne
,
and
the
Thornes
have
dine
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
be
duly
put
to
stand
on
her
box
,
and
in
that
position
have
find
herself
quite
unable
to
express
her
opinion
on
the
merit
of
flounce
,
such
have
be
the
subject
give
to
try
her
elocution
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
have
of
course
be
much
in
his
own
parish
,
look
to
the
doing
at
his
vicarage
,
call
on
his
parishioner
,
and
take
on
himself
the
duty
of
his
new
calling
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
have
be
every
evening
at
Plumstead
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
be
partly
willing
to
agree
with
her
husband
that
he
be
a
pleasant
inmate
in
a
house
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
also
be
at
a
dinner
-
party
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
,
of
which
Mr.
Arabin
have
make
one
.
<EOS>
He
also
,
mothlike
,
burn
his
wing
in
the
flame
of
the
signora
's
candle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
too
,
have
be
there
,
and
have
feel
somewhat
displeased
with
the
taste
 
want
of
taste
she
call
it
 
show
by
Mr.
Arabin
in
pay
so
much
attention
to
Madame
Neroni
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
infallible
that
Madeline
should
displease
and
irritate
the
woman
as
that
she
should
charm
and
captivate
the
man
.
<EOS>
the
one
result
follow
naturally
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
true
that
Mr.
Arabin
have
be
charm
.
<EOS>
He
think
her
a
very
clever
and
a
very
handsome
woman
;
he
think
also
that
her
peculiar
affliction
entitle
her
to
the
sympathy
of
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
,
he
say
,
meet
so
much
suffering
join
to
such
perfect
beauty
and
so
clear
a
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
speak
of
the
signora
,
come
home
in
the
archdeacon
's
carriage
,
and
Eleanor
by
no
mean
like
to
hear
the
praise
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
exceedingly
unjust
of
her
to
be
angry
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
she
have
herself
spend
a
very
pleasant
evening
with
Bertie
Stanhope
,
who
have
take
her
down
to
dinner
and
have
not
leave
her
side
for
one
moment
after
the
gentleman
come
out
of
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
unfair
that
she
should
amuse
herself
with
Bertie
and
yet
begrudge
her
new
friend
his
license
of
amuse
himself
with
Bertie
's
sister
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
half
-
angry
with
him
in
the
carriage
,
and
say
something
about
meretricious
manner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
do
not
understand
the
way
of
woman
very
well
,
or
else
he
may
have
flatter
himself
that
Eleanor
be
in
love
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
Eleanor
be
not
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
how
many
shade
there
be
between
love
and
indifference
,
and
how
little
the
graduated
scale
be
understand
!
<EOS>
She
have
now
be
nearly
three
week
in
the
same
house
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
have
receive
much
of
his
attention
and
listen
daily
to
his
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
have
usually
devote
at
least
some
portion
of
his
evening
to
her
exclusively
.
<EOS>
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
he
have
devote
himself
exclusively
to
another
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
require
that
a
woman
should
be
in
love
to
be
irritated
at
this
;
it
do
not
require
that
she
should
even
acknowledge
to
herself
that
it
be
unpleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
no
such
self
-
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
think
in
her
own
heart
that
it
be
only
on
Mr.
Arabin
's
account
that
she
regret
that
he
could
condescend
to
be
amuse
by
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
have
more
mind
,
"
she
say
to
herself
as
she
sit
watch
her
baby
's
cradle
on
her
return
from
the
party
.
"
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
believe
Mr.
Stanhope
be
the
pleasanter
man
of
the
two
.
"
<EOS>
alas
for
the
memory
of
poor
John
Bold
!
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
not
in
love
with
Bertie
Stanhope
,
nor
be
she
in
love
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
but
her
devotion
to
her
late
husband
be
fast
fade
when
she
could
revolve
in
her
mind
,
over
the
cradle
of
his
infant
,
the
fault
and
failing
of
other
aspirant
to
her
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Will
anyone
blame
my
heroine
for
this
?
<EOS>
let
him
or
her
rather
thank
God
for
all
His
goodness
 
for
His
mercy
endureth
forever
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
in
truth
,
be
not
in
love
;
neither
be
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
neither
indeed
be
Bertie
Stanhope
,
though
he
have
already
find
occasion
to
say
nearly
as
much
as
that
he
be
.
<EOS>
the
widow
's
cap
have
prevent
him
from
make
a
positive
declaration
,
when
otherwise
he
would
have
consider
himself
entitled
to
do
so
on
a
third
or
fourth
interview
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
after
all
,
but
a
small
cap
now
,
and
have
but
little
of
the
weeping
willow
leave
in
its
construction
.
<EOS>
It
be
singular
how
these
emblem
of
grief
fade
away
by
unseen
gradation
.
<EOS>
each
pretend
to
be
the
counterpart
of
the
forerunner
,
and
yet
the
last
little
bit
of
crimp
white
crape
that
sit
so
jauntily
on
the
back
of
the
head
be
as
dissimilar
to
the
first
huge
mountain
of
woe
which
disfigure
the
face
of
the
weeper
as
the
state
of
the
Hindu
be
to
the
jointure
of
the
english
dowager
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
it
be
clearly
understand
that
Eleanor
be
in
love
with
no
one
,
and
that
no
one
be
in
love
with
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
her
anger
against
Mr.
Arabin
do
not
last
long
,
and
before
two
day
be
over
they
be
both
as
good
friend
as
ever
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
like
him
,
for
every
hour
spend
in
his
company
be
spend
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
could
not
quite
like
him
,
for
there
be
always
apparent
in
his
conversation
<EOS>
a
certain
feeling
on
his
part
that
he
hardly
think
it
worth
his
while
to
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
as
though
he
be
play
with
a
child
.
<EOS>
She
know
well
enough
that
he
be
in
truth
a
sober
,
thoughtful
man
who
,
in
some
matter
and
on
some
occasion
,
could
endure
an
agony
of
earnestness
.
<EOS>
and
yet
to
her
he
be
always
gently
playful
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
see
his
brow
once
cloud
,
she
may
have
learn
to
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
so
thing
go
on
at
Plumstead
,
and
on
the
whole
not
unpleasantly
,
till
a
huge
storm
darken
the
horizon
and
come
down
upon
the
inhabitant
of
the
rectory
with
all
the
fury
of
a
water
-
spout
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
in
a
few
minute
the
whole
face
of
the
heavens
be
change
.
<EOS>
the
party
break
up
from
breakfast
in
perfect
harmony
,
but
fierce
passion
have
arise
before
the
evening
which
do
not
admit
of
their
sitting
at
the
same
board
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
to
explain
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
back
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
the
bishop
express
to
Mr.
Slope
in
his
dressing
-
room
his
determination
that
Mr.
Quiverful
should
be
confirm
in
his
appointment
to
the
hospital
,
and
that
his
lordship
request
Mr.
Slope
to
communicate
this
decision
to
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
It
will
also
be
remember
that
the
archdeacon
have
indignantly
decline
see
Mr.
Slope
,
and
have
instead
write
a
strong
letter
to
the
bishop
in
which
he
all
but
demand
the
situation
of
warden
for
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
to
this
letter
the
archdeacon
receive
an
immediate
formal
reply
from
Mr.
Slope
,
in
which
it
be
state
that
the
bishop
have
receive
and
would
give
his
good
consideration
to
the
archdeacon
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
feel
himself
somewhat
checkmate
by
this
reply
.
<EOS>
what
could
he
do
with
a
man
who
would
neither
see
him
,
nor
argue
with
him
by
letter
,
and
who
have
undoubtedly
the
power
of
appoint
any
clergyman
he
please
?
<EOS>
He
have
consult
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
have
suggest
the
propriety
of
call
in
the
aid
of
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
<EOS>
"
if
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
and
Dr.
Gwynne
formally
declare
your
intention
of
wait
upon
the
bishop
,
the
bishop
will
not
dare
to
refuse
to
see
you
;
and
if
two
such
man
as
you
be
see
him
together
,
you
will
probably
not
leave
him
without
carry
your
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
do
not
quite
like
admit
the
necessity
of
his
be
back
by
the
Master
of
Lazarus
before
he
could
obtain
admission
into
the
episcopal
palace
of
Barchester
,
but
still
he
feel
that
the
advice
be
good
,
and
he
resolve
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
He
write
again
to
the
bishop
,
express
a
hope
that
nothing
further
would
be
do
in
the
matter
of
the
hospital
till
the
consideration
promise
by
his
lordship
have
be
give
,
and
then
send
off
a
warm
appeal
to
his
friend
the
master
,
implore
him
to
come
to
plumstead
and
assist
in
drive
the
bishop
into
compliance
.
<EOS>
the
master
have
rejoin
,
raise
some
difficulty
,
but
not
decline
,
and
the
archdeacon
have
again
press
his
point
,
insist
on
the
necessity
for
immediate
action
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
unfortunately
have
the
gout
,
and
could
therefore
name
no
immediate
day
,
but
still
agree
to
come
,
if
it
should
be
finally
find
necessary
.
<EOS>
so
the
matter
stand
,
as
regard
the
party
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Harding
have
another
friend
fight
his
battle
for
him
,
quite
as
powerful
as
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
and
this
be
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
though
the
bishop
have
so
pertinaciously
insist
on
give
way
to
his
wife
in
the
matter
of
the
hospital
,
Mr.
Slope
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
abandon
his
object
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
he
think
,
daily
more
and
more
reason
to
imagine
that
the
widow
would
receive
his
overture
favourably
,
and
he
could
not
but
feel
that
Mr.
Harding
at
the
hospital
,
and
place
there
by
his
mean
,
would
be
more
likely
to
receive
him
as
a
son
-
in
-
law
than
Mr.
Harding
growl
in
opposition
and
disappointment
under
the
archdeacon
's
wing
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
to
give
Mr.
Slope
due
credit
,
he
be
actuate
by
great
motive
even
than
these
.
<EOS>
He
want
a
wife
,
and
he
want
money
,
but
he
want
power
more
than
either
.
<EOS>
He
have
fully
realize
the
fact
that
he
must
come
to
blow
with
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
desire
to
remain
in
Barchester
as
her
chaplain
.
<EOS>
sooner
than
do
so
,
he
would
risk
the
loss
of
his
whole
connexion
with
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
be
he
to
feel
within
him
<EOS>
the
possession
of
no
ordinary
talent
 
be
he
to
know
himself
to
be
courageous
,
firm
,
and
,
in
matter
where
his
conscience
do
not
interfere
,
unscrupulous
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
content
to
be
the
work
factotum
of
a
woman
prelate
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
high
idea
of
his
own
destiny
.
<EOS>
either
he
or
Mrs.
Proudie
must
go
to
the
wall
,
and
now
have
come
the
time
when
he
would
try
which
it
should
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
declare
that
Mr.
Quiverful
should
be
the
new
warden
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Slope
go
downstairs
,
prepare
to
see
the
archdeacon
,
if
necessary
,
but
fully
satisfied
that
no
such
necessity
would
arise
,
he
declare
to
himself
that
Mr.
Harding
should
be
warden
.
<EOS>
with
the
object
of
carry
this
point
,
he
ride
over
to
Puddingdale
and
have
a
further
interview
with
the
worthy
expectant
of
clerical
good
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
be
on
the
whole
a
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
the
impossible
task
of
bring
up
as
lady
and
gentleman
fourteen
child
on
an
income
which
be
insufficient
to
give
them
with
decency
the
common
necessary
of
life
,
have
have
an
effect
upon
him
not
beneficial
either
to
his
spirit
or
his
keen
sense
of
honour
.
<EOS>
who
can
boast
that
he
would
have
support
such
a
burden
with
a
different
result
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
be
an
honest
,
painstaking
,
drudging
man
,
anxious
indeed
for
bread
and
meat
,
anxious
for
mean
to
quiet
his
butcher
and
cover
with
return
smile
the
now
sour
countenance
of
the
baker
's
wife
;
but
anxious
also
to
be
right
with
his
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
careful
,
as
another
may
be
who
sit
on
an
easy
worldly
seat
,
to
stand
well
with
those
around
him
,
to
shun
a
breath
which
may
sully
his
name
or
a
rumour
which
may
affect
his
honour
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
afford
such
nicety
of
conduct
,
such
moral
luxury
.
<EOS>
It
must
suffice
for
him
to
be
ordinarily
honest
accord
to
the
ordinary
honesty
of
the
world
's
way
,
and
to
let
man
's
tongue
wag
as
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
feel
that
his
brother
clergyman
,
man
whom
he
have
know
for
the
last
twenty
year
,
look
coldly
on
him
from
the
first
moment
that
he
have
show
himself
willing
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
Mr.
Slope
;
he
have
see
that
their
look
grow
cold
still
when
it
become
bruit
about
that
he
be
to
be
the
bishop
's
new
warden
at
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
this
be
painful
enough
,
but
it
be
the
cross
which
he
be
doom
to
bear
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
his
wife
,
whose
last
new
silk
dress
be
six
year
in
wear
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
all
his
young
flock
,
whom
he
could
hardly
take
to
church
with
him
on
Sundays
,
for
there
be
not
decent
shoe
and
stocking
for
them
all
to
wear
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
well
-
wear
sleeve
of
his
own
black
coat
and
of
the
stern
face
of
the
draper
,
from
whom
he
would
fain
ask
for
cloth
to
make
another
,
do
he
not
know
that
the
credit
would
be
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
then
he
think
of
the
comfortable
house
in
Barchester
,
of
the
comfortable
income
,
of
his
boy
send
to
school
,
of
his
girl
with
book
in
their
hand
instead
of
darn
needle
,
of
his
wife
's
face
again
cover
with
smile
,
and
of
his
daily
board
again
cover
with
plenty
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
these
thing
;
and
do
thou
also
,
reader
,
think
of
them
,
and
then
wonder
,
if
thou
canst
,
that
Mr.
Slope
have
appear
to
him
to
possess
all
those
good
gift
which
could
grace
a
bishop
's
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountain
be
the
foot
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tiding
.
"
  
<EOS>
why
,
moreover
,
should
the
Barchester
clergy
have
look
coldly
on
Mr.
Quiverful
?
<EOS>
have
they
not
all
show
that
they
regard
with
complacency
the
loaf
and
fish
of
their
mother
church
?
<EOS>
have
they
not
all
,
by
some
hook
or
crook
,
do
better
for
themselves
than
he
have
do
?
<EOS>
They
be
not
burden
as
he
be
burden
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
have
five
child
and
nearly
as
many
thousand
a
year
on
which
to
feed
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
for
him
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
a
new
bishop
who
could
do
nothing
for
him
,
and
a
chaplain
who
be
beneath
his
notice
;
but
it
be
cruel
in
a
man
so
circumstanced
to
set
the
world
against
the
father
of
fourteen
child
because
he
be
anxious
to
obtain
for
them
an
honourable
support
!
<EOS>
He
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
have
not
ask
for
the
wardenship
;
he
have
not
even
accept
it
till
he
have
be
assure
that
Mr.
Harding
have
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
how
hard
then
that
he
should
be
blame
for
do
that
which
not
to
have
do
would
have
argue
a
most
insane
imprudence
!
  
<EOS>
thus
in
this
matter
of
the
hospital
poor
Mr.
Quiverful
have
his
trial
,
and
he
have
also
his
consolation
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
the
consolation
be
the
more
vivid
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
the
stern
draper
hear
of
the
come
promotion
,
and
the
wealth
of
his
warehouse
be
at
Mr.
Quiverful
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
come
event
cast
their
shadow
before
,
and
the
come
event
of
Mr.
Quiverful
's
transference
to
Barchester
produce
a
delicious
shadow
in
the
shape
of
a
new
outfit
for
Mrs.
Quiverful
and
her
three
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
such
consolation
come
home
to
the
heart
of
a
man
,
and
quite
home
to
the
heart
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
husband
may
feel
,
the
wife
care
nothing
for
frown
of
dean
,
archdeacon
,
or
prebendary
.
<EOS>
to
her
the
outside
and
inside
of
her
husband
and
fourteen
child
be
everything
.
<EOS>
in
her
bosom
every
other
ambition
have
be
swallow
up
in
that
maternal
ambition
of
see
them
and
him
and
herself
duly
clothe
and
properly
feed
.
<EOS>
It
have
come
to
that
with
her
that
life
have
now
no
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
recke
nothing
of
the
imaginary
right
of
other
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
patience
with
her
husband
when
he
declare
to
her
that
he
could
not
accept
the
hospital
unless
he
know
that
Mr.
Harding
have
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
have
no
right
to
be
quixotic
at
the
expense
of
fourteen
child
.
<EOS>
the
narrow
escape
of
throw
away
his
good
fortune
which
her
lord
have
have
,
almost
paralyse
her
.
<EOS>
now
,
indeed
,
they
have
receive
a
full
promise
,
not
only
from
Mr.
Slope
,
but
also
from
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
now
,
indeed
,
they
may
reckon
with
safety
on
their
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
but
what
if
all
have
be
lose
?
<EOS>
what
if
her
fourteen
bairn
have
be
resteepe
to
the
hip
in
poverty
by
the
morbid
sentimentality
of
their
father
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
just
at
present
a
happy
woman
,
but
yet
it
nearly
take
her
breath
away
when
she
think
of
the
risk
they
have
run
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
your
father
mean
when
he
talk
so
much
of
what
be
due
to
Mr.
Harding
,
"
she
say
to
her
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
he
think
that
Mr.
Harding
would
give
him
£
450
a
year
out
of
fine
feeling
?
<EOS>
and
what
signify
it
whom
he
offend
,
as
long
as
he
get
the
place
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
expect
anything
well
.
<EOS>
It
pass
me
to
think
how
your
father
can
be
so
soft
,
while
everybody
around
him
be
so
griping
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
,
while
the
outer
world
be
accuse
Mr.
Quiverful
of
rapacity
for
promotion
and
of
disregard
to
his
honour
,
the
inner
world
of
his
own
household
be
fall
foul
of
him
,
with
equal
vehemence
,
for
his
willingness
to
sacrifice
their
interest
to
a
false
feeling
of
sentimental
pride
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
much
difference
the
point
of
view
make
in
the
aspect
of
all
that
we
look
at
!
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
feeling
of
the
different
member
of
the
family
at
Puddingdale
on
the
occasion
of
Mr.
Slope
's
second
visit
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
as
soon
as
she
see
his
horse
come
up
the
avenue
from
the
vicarage
gate
,
hastily
pack
up
her
huge
basket
of
needlework
and
hurry
herself
and
her
daughter
out
of
the
room
in
which
she
be
sit
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
come
to
settle
with
you
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
do
hope
we
shall
now
be
able
to
move
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
she
hasten
to
bid
the
maid
of
all
work
go
to
the
door
,
so
that
the
welcome
great
man
may
not
be
keep
wait
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
thus
find
Mr.
Quiverful
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
go
off
to
her
kitchen
and
back
settlement
with
anxious
beat
heart
,
almost
dread
that
there
may
be
some
slip
between
the
cup
of
her
happiness
and
the
lip
of
her
fruition
,
but
yet
comfort
herself
with
the
reflexion
that
after
what
have
take
place
,
any
such
slip
could
hardly
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
all
smile
as
he
shake
his
brother
clergyman
's
hand
and
say
that
he
have
ride
over
because
he
think
it
right
at
once
to
put
Mr.
Quiverful
in
possession
of
the
fact
of
the
matter
regard
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
the
poor
expectant
husband
and
father
see
at
a
glance
that
his
brilliant
hope
be
to
be
dash
to
the
ground
,
and
that
his
visitor
be
now
there
for
the
purpose
of
unsay
what
on
his
former
visit
he
have
say
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
tone
of
the
voice
,
something
in
the
glance
of
the
eye
,
which
tell
the
tale
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
know
it
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
maintain
his
self
-
possession
,
however
,
smile
with
a
slight
unmeaning
smile
,
and
merely
say
that
he
be
oblige
to
Mr.
Slope
for
the
trouble
he
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
troublesome
matter
from
first
to
last
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
"
and
the
bishop
have
hardly
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
between
ourselves
 
<EOS>
but
mind
this
of
course
must
go
no
further
,
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
say
that
of
course
it
should
not
.
"
<EOS>
the
truth
be
that
poor
Mr.
Harding
have
hardly
know
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
You
remember
our
last
conversation
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
assure
him
that
he
remember
it
very
well
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
remember
that
I
tell
you
that
Mr.
Harding
have
refuse
to
return
to
the
hospital
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
declare
that
nothing
could
be
more
distinct
on
his
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
act
on
this
refusal
,
I
suggest
that
you
should
take
the
hospital
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
to
say
that
the
bishop
have
authorise
you
to
offer
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
?
<EOS>
do
I
go
so
far
as
that
?
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
it
may
be
that
in
my
anxiety
in
your
behalf
I
do
commit
myself
further
than
I
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
my
own
memory
serve
me
,
I
do
not
think
I
do
go
quite
so
far
as
that
.
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
be
very
anxious
that
you
should
get
it
,
and
<EOS>
I
may
have
say
more
than
be
quite
prudent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
Mr.
Quiverful
in
his
deep
anxiety
to
prove
his
case
,
"
my
wife
receive
as
distinct
a
promise
from
Mrs.
Proudie
as
one
human
being
could
give
to
another

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
smile
and
gently
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
mean
the
smile
for
a
pleasant
smile
,
but
it
be
diabolical
in
the
eye
of
the
man
he
be
speak
to
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
!
"
<EOS>
he

You

I
be

you

do
me
the

dreadfully

preservation

it
must

take
as
a
formal
promise
 
that

<EOS>
all
this
that
come
from
Mr.

so
true

<EOS>
Mr.

have
a
right

the
hospital

<EOS>
the
bishop
have
a
great
many
good
thing
to
give
away
.
<EOS>
both
the
bishop
and
Mr.
Slope
would
be
excellent
friend
and
terrible
enemy
to
a
man
in
his
position
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
have
no
proof
of
any
promise

he
could
not
force
the
bishop

appoint
him

<EOS>

Mr.

what

<EOS>
It

a
very
great

<EOS>
I
will
not
deny

I
be

very
poor

Mr.

<EOS>

in

Mr.

you
will
find

it

have
be

you

"
  
<EOS>
the
interview
end
in
Mr.
Slope
receive
a
full
renunciation
from
Mr.
Quiverful
of
any
claim
he
may
have
to
the
appointment
in
question
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
give
verbally
and
without
witness
,
but
then
the
original
promise
be
make
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
assure
him
that
he
should
not
be
forget
,
and
then
ride
back
to
Barchester

satisfy
that
he
would
now
be
able
to
mould
the
bishop
to
his
wish
.
   
<EOS>
fourteen
argument
in
Favour
of
Mr.
Quiverful
's
claim
 
<EOS>
We
have
most
of
us
hear
of
the
terrible
anger
of
a
lioness
<EOS>
when
,
surround
by
her
cub
,
she
guard
her
prey
.
<EOS>
few
of
us
wish
to
disturb
the
mother
of
a
litter
of
puppy
when
mouth
a
bone
in
the
midst
of
her
young
family
.
<EOS>
Medea
and
her
child
be
familiar
to
us
,
and
so
be
the
grief
of
Constance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
when
she
first
hear
from
her
husband
the
news
which
he
have
to
impart
,
feel
within
her
bosom
all
the
rage
of
the
lioness
,
the
rapacity
of
the
hound
,
the
fury
of
the
tragic
queen
,
and
the
deep
despair
of
the
bereave
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Doubting
,
but
yet
hardly
fear
,
what
may
have
be
the
tenor
of
Mr.
Slope
's
discourse
,
she
rush
back
to
her
husband
as
soon
as
the
front
door
be
close
behind
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
Mr.
Slope
that
he
so
escape
 
the
anger
of
such
a
woman
,
at
such
a
moment
,
would
have
cow
even
him
.
<EOS>
as
a
general
rule
,
it
be
highly
desirable
that
lady
should
keep
their
temper
:
a
woman
when
she
storm
always
make
herself
ugly
,
and
usually
ridiculous
also
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
odious
to
man
as
a
virago
.
<EOS>
though
Theseus
love
an
Amazon
,
he
show
his
love
but
roughly
,
and
from
the
time
of
Theseus
downward
,
no
man
ever
wish
to
have
his
wife
remarkable
rather
for
forward
prowess
than
retire
gentleness
.
<EOS>
a
low
voice
"
be
an
excellent
thing
in
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
may
be
lay
down
as
a
very
general
rule
;
and
few
woman
should
allow
themselves
to
deviate
from
it
,
and
then
only
on
rare
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
a
time
when
a
woman
may
let
her
hair
to
the
wind
,
when
she
may
loose
her
arm
,
and
scream
out
trumpet
-
tongued
to
the
ear
of
man
,
it
be
when
nature
call
out
within
her
not
for
her
own
want
,
but
for
the
want
of
those
whom
her
womb
have
bear
,
whom
her
breast
have
suckle
,
for
those
who
look
to
her
for
their
daily
bread
as
naturally
as
man
look
to
his
Creator
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
poetic
in
the
nature
of
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
She
be
neither
a
Medea
nor
a
Constance
.
<EOS>
when
angry
,
she
speak
out
her
anger
in
plain
word
,
and
in
a
tone
which
may
have
be
modulate
with
advantage
;
but
she
do
so
,
at
any
rate
,
without
affectation
.
<EOS>
now
,
without
know
it
,
she
rise
to
a
tragic
vein
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
we
be
not
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
the
word
with
which
her
ear
be
greet
when
she
enter
the
parlour
,
still
hot
from
the
kitchen
fire
.
<EOS>
and
the
face
of
her
husband
speak
even
more
plainly
than
his
word
:
    
e'en
<EOS>
such
a
man
,
so
faint
,
<EOS>
so
spiritless
,
<EOS>
so
dull
,
so
dead
in
look
,
so
woe
-
begone

"

"

and

with

She

I

be
so
soft
,
"
she
continue
.
<EOS>
"
take
my
word
for
it
,
the
bishop
know
no
more
about
it
than
Jemima
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jemima
be
the
two
-
year
-
old
.
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
you
will
lose
no
time
in
go
over
and
see
him
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
soft
,
however
,
as
Mr.
Quiverful
may
be
,
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
talk
out
of
his
opinion
on
this
occasion
,
and
proceed
with
much
minuteness
to
explain
to
his
wife
the
tone
in
which
Mr.
Slope
have
speak
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
interference
in
diocesan
matter
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
a
new
idea
gradually
instill
itself
into
the
matron
's
head
,
and
a
new
course
of
conduct
present
itself
to
her
judgement
.
<EOS>
what
if
,
after
all
,
Mrs.
Proudie
know
nothing
of
this
visit
of
Mr.
Slope
's
?
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
may
it
not
be
possible
that
that
lady
would
still
be
staunch
to
her
in
this
matter
,
still
stand
her
friend
,
and
,
perhaps
,
possibly
carry
her
through
in
opposition
to
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
say
nothing
as
this
vague
hope
occur
to
her
,
but
listen
with
more
than
ordinary
patience
to
what
her
husband
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
still
explain
that
in
all
probability
the
world
be
wrong
in
its
estimation
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
power
and
authority
,
she
have
fully
make
up
her
mind
as
to
her
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
proclaim
her
intention
.
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
ominously
as
he
continue
his
narration
,
and
when
he
have
complete
,
she
rise
to
go
,
merely
observe
that
it
be
cruel
,
cruel
treatment
.
<EOS>
She
then
ask
him
if
he
would
mind
wait
for
a
late
dinner
instead
of
dine
at
their
usual
hour
of
three
;
and
,
have
receive
from
him
a
concession
on
this
point
,
she
proceed
to
carry
her
purpose
into
execution
.
  
<EOS>
She
determine
that
she
would
at
once
go
to
the
palace
,
that
she
would
do
so
,
if
possible
,
before
Mrs.
Proudie
could
have
have
an
interview
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
that
she
would
be
either
submissive
,
piteous
,
and
pathetic
,
or
else
indignant
,
violent
,
and
exact
,
accord
to
the
manner
in
which
she
be
receive
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
quite
confident
in
her
own
power
.
<EOS>
strengthen
as
she
be
by
the
pressing
want
of
fourteen
child
,
she
feel
that
she
could
make
her
way
through
legion
of
episcopal
servant
and
force
herself
,
if
need
be
,
into
the
presence
of
the
lady
who
have
so
wrong
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
shame
about
it
,
no
_
mauvaise
honte
_
,
no
dread
of
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
as
she
declare
to
her
husband
,
make
her
wail
hear
in
the
market
-
place
if
she
do
not
get
redress
and
justice
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
for
an
unmarried
young
curate
to
be
shameface
in
such
matter
;
it
may
be
all
right
that
a
snug
rector
,
really
in
want
of
nothing
,
but
still
look
for
well
preferment
,
should
carry
on
his
affair
decently
under
the
rose
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
with
fourteen
child
,
have
give
over
be
shameface
and
,
in
some
thing
,
have
give
over
be
decent
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
intend
that
she
should
be
ill
-
use
in
the
manner
propose
by
Mr.
Slope
,
it
should
not
be
do
under
the
rose
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
should
know
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
present
mood
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
not
over
-
careful
about
her
attire
.
<EOS>
She
tie
her
bonnet
under
her
chin
,
throw
her
shawl
over
her
shoulder
,
arm
herself
with
the
old
family
cotton
umbrella
,
and
start
for
Barchester
.
<EOS>
a
journey
to
the
palace
be
not
quite
so
easy
a
thing
for
Mrs.
Quiverful
as
for
our
friend
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
plumstead
be
nine
mile
from
Barchester
,
and
Puddingdale
be
but
four
.
<EOS>
but
the
archdeacon
could
order
round
his
brougham
,
and
his
high
-
trot
fast
bay
gelding
would
take
him
into
the
city
within
the
hour
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
brougham
in
the
coach
-
house
of
Puddingdale
Vicarage
,
no
bay
horse
in
the
stable
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
method
of
locomotion
for
its
inhabitant
but
that
which
nature
have
assign
to
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
a
broad
,
heavy
woman
,
not
young
,
nor
give
to
walk
.
<EOS>
in
her
kitchen
,
and
in
the
family
dormitory
,
she
be
active
enough
,
but
her
pace
and
gait
be
not
adapt
for
the
road
.
<EOS>
a
walk
into
Barchester
and
back
in
the
middle
of
an
August
day
would
be
to
her
a
terrible
task
,
if
not
altogether
impracticable
.
<EOS>
there
be
live
in
the
parish
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
vicarage
on
the
road
to
the
city
,
a
decent
,
kindly
farmer
,
well
to
do
as
regard
this
world
and
so
far
mindful
of
the
next
that
he
attend
his
parish
church
with
decent
regularity
.
<EOS>
to
him
Mrs.
Quiverful
have
before
now
appeal
in
some
of
her
more
press
family
trouble
,
and
have
not
appeal
in
vain
.
<EOS>
at
his
door
she
now
present
herself
,
and
,
have
explain
to
his
wife
that
most
urgent
business
require
her
to
go
at
once
to
Barchester
,
beg
that
Farmer
Subsoil
would
take
her
thither
in
his
tax
-
cart
.
<EOS>
the
farmer
do
not
reject
her
plan
,
and
,
as
soon
as
Prince
could
be
get
into
his
collar
,
they
start
on
their
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
do
not
mention
the
purpose
of
her
business
,
nor
do
the
farmer
alloy
his
kindness
by
any
unseemly
question
.
<EOS>
She
merely
beg
to
be
put
down
at
the
bridge
go
into
the
city
and
to
be
take
up
again
at
the
same
place
in
the
course
of
two
hour
.
<EOS>
the
farmer
promise
to
be
punctual
to
his
appointment
,
and
the
lady
,
support
by
her
umbrella
,
take
the
short
cut
to
the
close
and
,
in
a
few
minute
,
be
at
the
bishop
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
have
feel
no
dread
with
regard
to
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
nothing
but
an
indignant
longing
to
pour
forth
her
claim
,
and
declare
her
wrong
,
if
those
claim
be
not
fully
admit
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
difficulty
of
her
situation
touch
her
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
at
the
palace
once
before
,
but
then
she
go
to
give
grateful
thank
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
thank
to
return
for
favour
receive
find
easy
admittance
to
the
hall
of
the
great
.
<EOS>
such
be
not
always
the
case
with
man
,
or
even
with
woman
,
who
have
favour
to
beg
.
<EOS>
still
less
easy
be
access
for
those
who
demand
the
fulfilment
of
promise
already
make
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
have
not
be
slow
to
learn
the
way
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
know
all
this
,
and
she
know
also
that
her
cotton
umbrella
and
all
but
ragged
shawl
would
not
command
respect
in
the
eye
of
the
palatial
servant
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
too
humble
,
she
know
well
that
she
would
never
succeed
.
<EOS>
to
overcome
by
imperious
overbearing
with
such
a
shawl
as
her
upon
her
shoulder
and
such
a
bonnet
on
her
head
would
have
require
a
personal
bearing
very
superior
to
that
with
which
nature
have
endow
her
.
<EOS>
of
this
also
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
aware
.
<EOS>
She
must
make
it
known
that
she
be
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
,
and
must
yet
condescend
to
conciliate
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
lady
know
but
one
way
to
overcome
these
difficulty
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
enterprise
,
and
to
this
she
resort
.
<EOS>
low
as
be
the
domestic
fund
at
Puddingdale
,
she
still
retain
possession
of
half
a
crown
,
and
this
she
sacrifice
to
the
avarice
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
metropolitan
sesquipedalian
serving
-
man
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
she
say
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
of
Puddingdale
,
the
wife
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
She
wish
to
see
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
quite
indispensable
that
she
should
see
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
James
Fitzplush
look
bad
than
dubious
,
do
not
know
whether
his
lady
be
out
,
or
engage
,
or
in
her
bedroom
;
think
it
most
probable
she
be
subject
to
one
of
these
or
to
some
other
cause
that
would
make
her
invisible
;
but
Mrs.
Quiverful
could
sit
down
in
the
waiting
-
room
while
inquiry
be
be
make
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
my
man
,
"
say
Mrs.
Quiverful
;
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
her
;
"
and
she
put
her
card
and
half
-
crown
 
<EOS>
think
of
it
,
<EOS>
my
reader
,
think
of
it
;
her
last
half
-
crown
 
into
the
man
's
hand
and
sit
herself
down
on
a
chair
in
the
waiting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
bribe
carry
the
day
,
or
whether
the
bishop
's
wife
really
choose
to
see
the
vicar
's
wife
,
it
boot
not
now
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
the
man
return
and
,
beg
Mrs.
Quiverful
to
follow
him
,
usher
her
into
the
presence
of
the
mistress
of
the
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
at
once
see
that
her
patroness
be
in
a
smile
humour
.
<EOS>
Triumph
sit
throne
upon
her
brow
,
and
all
the
joy
of
dominion
hover
about
her
curl
.
<EOS>
Her
lord
have
that
morning
contest
with
her
a
great
point
.
<EOS>
He
have
receive
an
invitation
to
spend
a
couple
of
day
with
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
His
soul
long
for
the
gratification
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
,
however
,
in
his
grace
's
note
allude
to
the
fact
of
his
be
a
married
man
;
if
he
go
at
all
,
he
must
go
alone
.
<EOS>
this
necessity
would
have
present
no
insurmountable
bar
to
the
visit
,
or
have
militate
much
against
the
pleasure
,
have
he
be
able
to
go
without
any
reference
to
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
but
this
he
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
order
his
portmanteau
to
be
pack
and
start
with
his
own
man
,
merely
tell
the
lady
of
his
heart
that
he
would
probably
be
back
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
 
<EOS>
may
we
not
rather
say
monster
?
 
<EOS>
who
do
such
thing
,
and
there
be
wife
 
<EOS>
may
we
not
rather
say
slave
?
 
<EOS>
who
put
up
with
such
usage
.
<EOS>
but
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Proudie
be
not
among
the
number
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
with
some
beat
about
the
bush
,
make
the
lady
understand
that
he
very
much
wish
to
go
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
without
any
beating
about
the
bush
,
make
the
bishop
understand
that
she
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
here
to
repeat
the
argument
that
be
use
on
each
side
,
and
needless
to
record
the
result
.
<EOS>
those
who
be
married
will
understand
very
well
how
the
battle
be
lose
and
win
,
and
those
who
be
single
will
never
understand
it
till
they
learn
the
lesson
which
experience
alone
can
give
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
show
into
Mrs.
Proudie
's
room
,
that
lady
have
only
return
a
few
minute
from
her
lord
.
<EOS>
but
before
she
leave
him
she
have
see
the
answer
to
the
archbishop
's
note
write
and
seal
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
her
face
be
wreathe
with
smile
as
she
receive
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
She
instantly
speak
of
the
subject
which
be
so
near
the
heart
of
her
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
it

yet
when
you
be
to
move
into
Barchester

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
woman

as
she
have
an
hour
or
two
since
be
call
,
become
instantly
re

endowed
with
all
the
grace
that
can
adorn
a
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
immediately
see
that
her
business
be
to
be
piteous
,
and
that
nothing
be
to
be
gain
by
indignation
 
nothing
,
indeed
,
unless
she
could
be
indignant
in
company
with
her
patroness
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mrs.
Proudie
<EOS>
,
"
she
begin
,
"
I
fear
we
be
not
to
move
to
Barchester
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
say
that
lady
sharply
,
drop
at
a
moment
's
notice
her
smile
and
condescension
,
and
turn
with
her
sharp
quick
way
to
business
which
she
see
at
a
glance
be
important
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Mrs.
Quiverful
tell
her
tale
.
<EOS>
as
she
progress
in
the
history
of
her
wrong
she
perceive
that
the
heavier
she
lean
upon
Mr.
Slope
<EOS>
the
blacker
become
Mrs.
Proudie
's
brow
,
but
that
such
blackness
be
not
injurious
to
her
own
case
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Slope
be
at
Puddingdale
Vicarage
that
morning
she
have
regard
him
as
the
creature
of
the
lady

bishop
;
now
she
perceive
that
they
be
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
admit
her
mistake
to
herself
without
any
pain
or
humiliation
.
<EOS>
She
have
but
one
feeling
,
and
that
be
confine
to
her
family
.
<EOS>
She
care
little
how
she
twist
and
turn
among
these
new

comer
at
the
bishop
's
palace
so
long
as
she
could
twist
her
husband
into
the
warden
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
care
not
which
be
her
friend
or
which
be
her
enemy
,
if
only
she
could
get
this
preferment
which
she
so
sorely
want
.
  
<EOS>
She
tell
her
tale
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
listen
to
it
almost
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
tell
how
Mr.
Slope
have
cozen
her
husband
into
resign
his
claim
,
and
have
declare
that
it
be
the
bishop
's
will
<EOS>
that
none
but
Mr.
Harding
should
be
warden
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
brow
become
blacker
and
blacker
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
start
from
her
chair
and
,
beg
Mrs.
Quiverful
to
sit
and
wait
for
her
return
,
march
out
of
the
room

<EOS>
"

Mrs.
Proudie

"
<EOS>
such
be
the
burden
that
fall
on
her
ear
as
she
close
the
door
behind
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
Wrestles
and
get
a
fall
 
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
an
hour
since
Mrs.
Proudie
have
leave
her
husband
's
apartment
victorious
,
and
yet
so
indomitable
be
her
courage
that
she
now
return
thither
pant
for
another
combat
.
<EOS>
She
be
greatly
angry
with
what
she
think
be
his
duplicity
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
clearly
give
her
a
promise
on
this
matter
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
already
so
absolutely
vanquish
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
begin
to
feel
that
if
every
affair
be
to
be
thus
discuss
and
battle
about
twice
and
even
thrice
,
the
work
of
the
diocese
would
be
too
much
even
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
without
knock
at
the
door
,
she
walk
quickly
into
her
husband
's
room
and
find
him
seat
at
his
office
table
,
with
Mr.
Slope
opposite
to
him
.
<EOS>
between
his
finger
be
the
very
note
which
he
have
write
to
the
archbishop
in
her
presence
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
open
!
<EOS>
yes
,
he
have
absolutely
violate
the
seal
which
have
be
make
sacred
by
her
approval
.
<EOS>
They
be
sit
in
deep
conclave
,
and
it
be
too
clear
that
the
purport
of
the
archbishop
's
invitation
have
be
absolutely
canvass
again
,
after
it
have
be
already
debate
and
decide
on
in
obedience
to
her
behest
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
rise
from
his
chair
and
bow
slightly
.
<EOS>
the
two
oppose
spirit
look
each
other
fully
in
the
face
,
and
they
know
that
they
be
look
each
at
an
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
,
Bishop
,
about
Mr.
Quiverful
?
"
say
she
,
come
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
stand
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
do
not
allow
the
bishop
to
answer
but
reply
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
out
to
Puddingdale
this
morning
,
madam
,
and
have
see
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
have
abandon
his
claim
to
the
hospital
because
he
be
now
aware
that
Mr.
Harding
be
desirous
to
fill
his
old
place
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
I
have
strongly
advise
his
lordship
to
nominate
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Quiverful
have
not
abandon
anything
,
"
say
the
lady
,
with
a
very
imperious
voice
.
"
<EOS>
His
lordship
's
word
have
be
pledge
to
him
,
and
it
must
be
respect
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
still
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxiously
desirous
of
make
his
old
enemy
bite
the
dust
beneath
his
foot
.
<EOS>
His
new
ally
have
tell
him
that
nothing
be
more
easy
for
him
than
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
ally
be
there
now
at
his
elbow
to
help
him
,
and
yet
his
courage
fail
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
hard
to
conquer
when
the
prestige
of
former
victory
be
all
against
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
hard
for
the
cock
who
have
once
be
beat
out
of
his
yard
to
resume
his
courage
and
again
take
a
proud
place
upon
a
dunghill
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
ought
not
to
interfere
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
"
but
<EOS>
yet
 
"
  
"
certainly
you
ought
not
,
"
say
the
infuriate
dame
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
yet
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
,
not
regard
the
interruption
,
"
I
have
think
it
my
imperative
duty
to
recommend
the
bishop
not
to
slight
Mr.
Harding
's
claim
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Harding
should
have
know
his
own
mind
,
"
say
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
Mr.
Harding
be
not
replace
at
the
hospital
,
his
lordship
will
have
to
encounter
much
ill
-
will
,
not
only
in
the
diocese
,
but
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
besides
,
take
a
high
ground
,
his
lordship
,
as
I
understand
,
feel
it
to
be
his
duty
to
gratify
,
in
this
matter
,
so
very
worthy
a
man
<EOS>
and
so
good
a
clergyman
as
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
be
to
become
of
the
Sabbath
-
day
school
and
of
the
Sunday
service
in
the
hospital
?
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
,
with
something
very
nearly
approach
to
a
sneer
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
Mr.
Harding
make
no
objection
to
the
Sabbath
-
day
school
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
hospital
service
,
that
matter
will
be
best
discuss
after
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
any
permanent
objection
,
then
,
I
fear
,
the
matter
must
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
very
easy
conscience
in
such
matter
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
an
easy
conscience
,
"
he
rejoin
,
"
but
a
conscience
very
far
from
be
easy
,
if
anything
say
or
do
by
me
should
lead
the
bishop
to
act
unadvisedly
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
in
the
interview
<EOS>
I
have
with
Mr.
Harding
<EOS>
I
misunderstood
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
it
be
equally
clear
that
you
have
misunderstood
Mr.
Quiverful
,
"
say
she
,
now
at
the
top
of
her
wrath
.
<EOS>
"
what
business
have
you
at
all
with
these
interview
?
<EOS>
who
desire
you
to
go
to
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
?
<EOS>
who
commission
you
to
manage
this
affair
?
<EOS>
Will
you
answer
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
who
send
you
to
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
pause
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
be
stand
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
it
,
look
at
first
very
solemn
and
now
very
black
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
be
stand
as
she
have
at
first
place
herself
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
and
as
she
interrogate
her
foe
<EOS>
she
strike
her
hand
upon
it
with
almost
more
than
feminine
vigour
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
sit
in
his
easy
chair
twiddle
his
thumb
,
turn
his
eye
now
to
his
wife
,
and
now
to
his
chaplain
,
as
each
take
up
the
cudgel
.
<EOS>
how
comfortable
it
would
be
if
they
could
fight
it
out
between
them
without
the
necessity
of
any
interference
on
his
part
;
fight
it
out
so
that
one
should
kill
the
other
utterly
,
as
far
as
diocesan
life
be
concern
,
so
that
he
,
the
bishop
,
may
know
clearly
by
whom
it
behove
him
to
be
lead
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
the
comfort
of
quiet
in
either
case
;
but
if
the
bishop
have
a
wish
as
to
which
may
prove
the
victor
,
that
wish
be
certainly
not
antagonistic
to
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
the
d
 
---
you
know
than
the
d
 
---
you
do
not
know
,
"
be
an
old
saying
,
and
perhaps
a
true
one
;
but
the
bishop
have
not
yet
realize
the
truth
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
answer
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
who
instruct
you
to
call
on
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
another
pause
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
intend
to
answer
me
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
that
under
all
the
circumstance
it
will
be
well
for
me
not
to
answer
such
a
question
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
many
tone
in
his
voice
,
all
duly
under
his
command
;
among
them
be
a
sanctify
low
tone
and
a
sanctify
loud
tone
 
<EOS>
he
now
use
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
anyone
send
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
"
I
be
quite
aware
how
much
I
owe
to
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
I
be
aware
also
what
be
due
by
courtesy
from
a
gentleman
to
a
lady
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
high
consideration
than
either
of
those
,
and
I
hope
I
shall
be
forgive
if
I
now
allow
myself
to
be
actuate
solely
by
them
.
<EOS>
My
duty
in
this
matter
be
to
his
lordship
,
and
I
can
admit
of
no
questioning
but
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
approve
of
what
I
have
do
,
and
you
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
that
,
have
that
approval
and
my
own
,
I
want
none
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
horrid
word
be
these
which
greet
the
ear
of
Mrs.
Proudie
?
<EOS>
the
matter
be
indeed
too
clear
.
<EOS>
there
be
premeditate
mutiny
in
the
camp
.
<EOS>
not
only
have
ill
-
condition
mind
become
insubordinate
by
the
fruition
of
a
little
power
,
but
sedition
have
be
overtly
teach
and
preach
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
not
yet
be
twelve
month
in
his
chair
,
and
rebellion
have
already
rear
her
hideous
head
within
the
palace
.
<EOS>
anarchy
and
misrule
would
quickly
follow
unless
she
take
immediate
and
strong
measure
to
put
down
the
conspiracy
which
she
have
detect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
say
with
slow
and
dignified
voice
,
differ
much
from
that
which
she
have
hitherto
use
,
"
Mr.
Slope
,
I
will
trouble
you
,
if
you
please
,
to
leave
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
speak
to
my
lord
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
also
feel
that
everything
depend
on
the
present
interview
.
<EOS>
Should
the
bishop
now
be
re
-
petticoate
,
his
thraldom
would
be
complete
and
forever
.
<EOS>
the
present
moment
be
peculiarly
propitious
for
rebellion
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
clearly
commit
himself
by
break
the
seal
of
the
answer
to
the
archbishop
;
he
have
therefore
fear
to
influence
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
tell
him
that
no
consideration
ought
to
induce
him
to
refuse
the
archbishop
's
invitation
;
he
have
therefore
hope
to
influence
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
accept
Mr.
Quiverful
's
resignation
and
therefore
dread
have
to
renew
that
matter
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
screw
up
to
the
pitch
of
assert
a
will
of
his
own
,
and
may
possibly
be
carry
on
till
by
an
absolute
success
he
should
have
be
teach
how
possible
it
be
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
now
be
the
moment
for
victory
or
rout
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
that
Mr.
Slope
must
make
himself
master
of
the
diocese
,
or
else
resign
his
place
and
begin
his
search
for
fortune
again
.
<EOS>
He
see
all
this
plainly
.
<EOS>
after
what
have
take
place
any
compromise
between
him
and
the
lady
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
let
him
once
leave
the
room
at
her
bidding
and
leave
the
bishop
in
her
hand
,
and
he
may
at
once
pack
up
his
portmanteau
and
bid
adieu
to
episcopal
honour
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
and
the
Signora
Neroni
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
not
so
easy
to
keep
his
ground
when
he
be
bid
by
a
lady
to
go
,
or
to
continue
to
make
a
third
in
a
party
between
a
husband
and
wife
when
the
wife
express
a
wish
for
a
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
repeat
,
"
I
wish
to
be
alone
with
my
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
have
summon
me
on
most
important
diocesan
business
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
glance
with
uneasy
eye
at
Dr.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
must
trust
something
to
the
bishop
,
and
yet
that
that
trust
be
so
woefully
ill
-
place
.
<EOS>
"
My
leave
him
at
the
present
moment
be
,
I
fear
,
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
bandy
word
with
me
,
you
ungrateful
man
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
beg
Mr.
Slope
to
leave
the
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
scratch
his
head
,
but
for
the
moment
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
this
be
as
much
as
Mr.
Slope
expect
from
him
,
and
be
on
the
whole
,
for
him
,
an
active
exercise
of
marital
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
be
Mr.
Slope
to
leave
this
room
,
or
be
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mrs.
Proudie
make
a
false
step
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
allude
to
the
possibility
of
retreat
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
express
the
idea
that
her
order
for
Mr.
Slope
's
expulsion
could
be
treat
otherwise
than
by
immediate
obedience
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
such
a
question
the
bishop
naturally
say
in
his
own
mind
that
,
as
it
be
necessary
that
one
should
leave
the
room
,
perhaps
it
may
be
as
well
that
Mrs.
Proudie
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
do
say
so
in
his
own
mind
,
but
externally
he
again
scratch
his
head
and
again
twiddle
his
thumb
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
be
boil
over
with
wrath
.
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
she
but
have
keep
her
temper
as
her
enemy
do
,
she
would
have
conquer
as
she
have
ever
conquer
.
<EOS>
but
divine
anger
get
the
well
of
her
,
as
it
have
do
of
other
heroine
,
and
she
fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
I
to
be
vouchsafe
an
answer
or
be
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
break
his
deep
silence
and
proclaim
himself
a
Slopeite
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
Mr.
Slope
and
I
be
very
busy
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
to
the
battlefield
,
stand
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
day
,
encounter
the
fury
of
the
foe
,
and
win
the
victory
.
<EOS>
how
easy
be
success
to
those
who
will
only
be
true
to
themselves
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
see
at
once
the
full
amount
of
his
gain
,
and
turn
on
the
vanquished
lady
a
look
of
triumph
which
she
never
forget
and
never
forgave
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
look
humbly
at
her
and
,
with
meek
entreat
eye
,
have
deprecate
her
anger
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
say
by
his
glance
that
he
ask
pardon
for
his
success
,
and
that
he
hope
forgiveness
for
the
stand
which
he
have
be
force
to
make
in
the
cause
of
duty
.
<EOS>
so
may
he
perchance
have
somewhat
mollify
that
imperious
bosom
and
prepare
the
way
for
future
term
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
mean
to
rule
without
term
.
<EOS>
ah
,
forgetful
,
inexperienced
man
!
<EOS>
Can
you
cause
that
little
tremble
victim
to
be
divorce
from
the
woman
that
possess
him
?
<EOS>
Can
you
provide
that
they
shall
be
separate
at
bed
and
board

<EOS>
be
he
not
flesh
of
her
flesh
and
bone
of
her
bone
,
and
must
he
not
so
continue
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
now
for
you
to
stand
your
ground
and
triumph
as
she
be
drive
ignominiously
from
the
room
,
but
can
you
be
present
when
those
curtain
be
draw
,
when
that
awful
helmet
of
proof
have
be
tie
beneath
the
chin
,
when
the
small
remnant
of
the
bishop
's
prowess
shall
be
cow
by
the
tassel
above
his
head
?
<EOS>
Can
you
then
intrude
yourself
when
the
wife
wish
"
to
speak
to
my
lord
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
for
the
moment
Mr.
Slope
's
triumph
be
complete
,
for
Mrs.
Proudie
without
further
parley
<EOS>
leave
the
room
and
do
not
forget
to
shut
the
door
after
her
.
<EOS>
then
follow
a
close
conference
between
the
new
ally
,
in
which
be
say
much
which
it
astonish
Mr.
Slope
to
say
and
the
bishop
to
hear
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
one
say
it
and
the
other
hear
it
without
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
mincing
of
matter
now
.
<EOS>
the
chaplain
plainly
tell
the
bishop
that
the
world
give
him
credit
for
be
under
the
governance
of
his
wife
;
that
his
credit
and
character
in
the
diocese
be
suffer
;
that
he
would
surely
get
himself
in
hot
water
if
he
allow
Mrs.
Proudie
to
interfere
in
matter
which
be
not
suitable
for
a
woman
's
power
;
and
in
fact
that
he
would
become
contemptible
if
he
do
not
throw
off
the
yoke
under
which
he
groan
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
at
first
hummed
and
haw
and
affect
to
deny
the
truth
of
what
be
say
.
<EOS>
but
his
denial
be
not
stout
and
quickly
break
down
.
<EOS>
He
soon
admit
by
silence
his
state
of
vassalage
and
pledge
himself
,
with
Mr.
Slope
's
assistance
,
to
change
his
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
also
do
not
make
out
a
bad
case
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
explain
how
it
grieve
him
to
run
counter
to
a
lady
who
have
always
be
his
patroness
,
who
have
befriend
him
in
so
many
way
,
who
have
,
in
fact
,
recommend
him
to
the
bishop
's
notice
;
but
,
as
he
state
,
his
duty
be
now
imperative
;
he
hold
a
situation
of
peculiar
confidence
,
and
be
immediately
and
especially
attach
to
the
bishop
's
person
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
situation
his
conscience
require
that
he
should
regard
solely
the
bishop
's
interest
,
and
therefore
he
have
venture
to
speak
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
take
this
for
what
it
be
worth
,
and
Mr.
Slope
only
intend
that
he
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
gild
the
pill
which
Mr.
Slope
have
to
administer
,
and
which
the
bishop
thought
would
be
less
bitter
than
that
other
pill
which
he
have
so
long
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
have
his
immediate
reward
,
like
a
good
child
.
<EOS>
He
be
instruct
to
write
and
at
once
do
write
another
note
to
the
archbishop
accept
his
grace
's
invitation
.
<EOS>
this
note
Mr.
Slope
,
more
prudent
than
the
lady
,
himself
take
away
and
post
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
thus
he
make
sure
that
this
act
of
self
-
jurisdiction
should
be
as
nearly
as
possible
a
_
fait
accompli
_
.
<EOS>
He
beg
,
and
coaxed
,
and
threaten
the
bishop
with
a
view
of
make
him
also
write
at
once
to
Mr.
Harding
,
but
the
bishop
,
though
temporally
emancipate
from
his
wife
,
be
not
yet
enthral
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
and
probably
say
truly
,
that
such
an
offer
must
be
make
in
some
official
form
;
that
he
be
not
yet
prepared
to
sign
the
form
;
and
that
he
should
prefer
see
Mr.
Harding
before
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
may
,
however
,
beg
Mr.
Harding
to
call
upon
him
.
<EOS>
not
disappointed
with
his
achievement
Mr.
Slope
go
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
first
post
the
precious
note
which
he
have
in
his
pocket
,
and
then
pursue
other
enterprise
in
which
we
must
follow
him
in
other
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
have
receive
such
satisfaction
as
be
to
be
derive
from
slam
her
husband
's
door
,
do
not
at
once
betake
herself
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
for
the
first
few
moment
after
her
repulse
she
feel
that
she
could
not
again
see
that
lady
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
to
own
that
she
have
be
beat
,
to
confess
that
the
diadem
have
pass
from
her
brow
,
and
the
sceptre
from
her
hand
!
<EOS>
no
,
she
would
send
a
message
to
her
with
a
promise
of
a
letter
on
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
thus
resolve
,
she
betake
herself
to
her
bedroom
,
but
here
she
again
change
her
mind
.
<EOS>
the
air
of
that
sacred
enclosure
somewhat
restore
her
courage
and
give
her
more
heart
.
<EOS>
as
achille
warm
at
the
sight
of
his
armour
,
as
Don
Quixote
's
heart
grow
strong
when
he
grasp
his
lance
,
so
do
Mrs.
Proudie
look
forward
to
fresh
laurel
,
as
her
eye
fall
on
her
husband
's
pillow
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
despair
.
<EOS>
have
so
resolve
,
she
descend
with
dignified
mien
and
refresh
countenance
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
this
scene
in
the
bishop
's
study
take
longer
in
the
acting
than
in
the
telling
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
,
perhaps
,
have
the
whole
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
begin
to
be
very
impatient
,
and
be
think
that
Farmer
Subsoil
would
be
tired
of
wait
for
her
,
when
Mrs.
Proudie
return
.
<EOS>
oh
,
who
can
tell
the
palpitation
of
that
maternal
heart
,
as
the
suppliant
look
into
the
face
of
the
great
lady
to
see
write
there
<EOS>
either
a
promise
of
house
,
income
,
comfort
and
future
competence
,
or
else
the
doom
of
continued
and
ever
-
increase
poverty
!
<EOS>
poor
mother
!
<EOS>
poor
wife
!
<EOS>
there
be
little
there
to
comfort
you
!
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
"
thus
speak
the
lady
with
considerable
austerity
,
and
without
sit
down
herself
,
"
I
find
that
your
husband
have
behave
in
this
matter
in
a
very
weak
and
foolish
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
immediately
rise
upon
her
foot
,
think
it
disrespectful
to
remain
sit
while
the
wife
of
the
bishop
stand
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
desire
to
sit
down
again
,
and
make
to
do
so
,
so
that
Mrs.
Proudie
may
stand
and
preach
over
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
consider
an
offensive
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
keep
his
seat
while
another
be
keep
stand
before
him
,
and
we
presume
the
same
law
hold
with
regard
to
lady
.
<EOS>
It
often
be
so
felt
,
but
we
be
inclined
to
say
that
it
never
produce
half
the
discomfort
or
half
the
feeling
of
implied
inferiority
that
be
show
by
a
great
man
who
desire
his
visitor
to
be
seat
while
he
himself
speak
from
his
leg
.
<EOS>
such
a
solecism
in
good
breeding
,
when
construe
into
English
,
mean
this
:
"
the
accept
rule
of
courtesy
in
the
world
require
that
I
should
offer
you
a
seat
;
if
I
do
not
do
so
,
you
would
bring
a
charge
against
me
in
the
world
of
be
arrogant
and
ill
-
mannered
;
I
will
obey
the
world
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
I
will
not
put
myself
on
an
equality
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
sit
down
,
but
I
will
not
sit
with
you
.
<EOS>
sit
,
therefore
,
at
my
bidding
,
and
I
will
stand
and
talk
at
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
just
what
Mrs.
Proudie
mean
to
say
,
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
though
she
be
too
anxious
and
too
flurried
thus
to
translate
the
full
meaning
of
the
manoeuvre
,
do
not
fail
to
feel
its
effect
.
<EOS>
She
be
cow
and
uncomfortable
,
and
a
second
time
essay
to
rise
from
her
chair

<EOS>
"
pray

Mrs.
Quiverful

pray
keep
your

Your

I
say

have
be
most
weak

most
foolish

It
be
impossible

help
people
who
will
not

I
much

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

Mrs.

do
not

in

to
resign

do
 
what

It
be

for
the

respectably

"
<EOS>
not
a
word
fall
from
her
about
herself
,
but
the
tear
come
stream
down
her
big
,
coarse
cheek
,
on
which
the
dust
of
the
August
road
have
leave
its
trace
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
not
be
portray
in
these
page
as
an
agreeable
or
an
amiable
lady
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
intention
to
impress
the
reader
much
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
It
be
ordain
that
all
novel
should
have
a
male
and
a
female
angel
and
a
male
and
a
female
devil
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
consider
that
this
rule
be
obey
in
these
page
,
the
latter
character
must
be
suppose
to
have
fall
to
the
lot
of
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
all
devil
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
heart
inside
that
stiff
-
rib
bodice
,
though
not
,
perhaps
,
of
large
dimension
,
and
certainly
not
easily
accessible
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
however
,
do
gain
access
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
prove
herself
a
woman
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
fourteen
child
with
their
probable
bare
bread
and
their
possible
bare
back
,
or
the
respectability
of
the
father
's
work
,
or
the
mingle
dust
and
tear
on
the
mother
's
face
,
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Proudie
be
touch
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
show
it
as
other
woman
may
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
give
Mrs.
Quiverful
eau

Cologne
,
or
order
her
a
glass
of
wine

<EOS>
She
do

offer
her
the

comb

towel
and
water

<EOS>
She
do
not
say
soft
little
speech
and
coax
her
kindly
back
to
equanimity
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
despite
her
rough
appearance
,
would
have
be
as
amenable
to
such
little
tender
care
as
any
lady
in
the
land

<EOS>
but
none
such
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
instead
of
this
,
Mrs.
Proudie
slap
one
hand
upon
the
other
and
declare
 
not
with
an
oath
,
for
,
as
a
lady
and
a
Sabbatarian
and
a
she

bishop
,
she
could
not
swear
,
but
with
an
adjuration
 
that
she
"
would
not
have
it
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
this
be
that
she
would
not
have
Mr.
Quiverful
's
promise
appointment
cozen
away
by
the
treachery
of
Mr.
Slope
and
the
weakness
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
this
meaning
she
very
soon
explain
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
your
husband
such
a
fool
,
"
say
she
,
now
dismount
from
her
high
horse
and
sit
confidentially
down
close
to
her
visitor
,
"
as
to
take
the
bait
which
that
man
throw
to
him
?
<EOS>
if
he
have
not
be
so
utterly
foolish
,
nothing
could
have
prevent
your
go
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
ready
enough
with
her
own
tongue
in
accuse
her
husband
to
his
face
of
be
soft
,
and
perhaps
do
not
always
speak
of
him
to
her
child
quite
so
respectfully
as
she
may
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
at
all
like
to
hear
him
abuse
by
other
,
and
begin
to
vindicate
him
and
to
explain
that
of
course
he
have
take
Mr.
Slope
to
be
an
emissary
from
Mrs.
Proudie
herself
;
that
Mr.
Slope
be
think
to
be
peculiarly
her
friend
;
and
that
,
therefore
,
Mr.
Quiverful
would
have
be
fail
in
respect
to
her
<EOS>
have
he
assume
to
doubt
what
Mr.
Slope
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
thus
mollify
,
Mrs.
Proudie
again
declare
that
she
"
would
not
have
it
do
,
"
and
at
last
send
Mrs.
Quiverful
home
with
an
assurance
that
,
to
the
furth
stretch
of
her
power
and
influence
in
the
palace
,
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Quiverful
should
be
insist
on
.
<EOS>
as
she
repeat
the
word
"
insist
,
"
she
think
of
the
bishop
in
his
night
-
cap
and
,
with
compress
lip
,
slightly
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
oh
,
my
aspiring
pastor
,
divine
to
whose
ear
<EOS>
_
nolo
episcopari
_
be
the
sweetest
of
word
,
which
of
you
would
be
a
bishop
on
such
term
as
these
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
get
home
in
the
farmer
's
cart
,
not
indeed
with
a
light
heart
,
but
satisfy
that
she
have
do
right
in
make
her
visit
.
   
<EOS>
a
Love
scene
 
Mr.
Slope
,
as
we
have
say
,
leave
the
palace
with
a
feeling
of
considerable
triumph
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
think
that
his
difficulty
be
all
over
 
he
do
not
so
deceive
himself
 
<EOS>
but
he
feel
that
he
have
play
his
first
move
well
,
as
well
as
the
piece
on
the
board
would
allow
,
and
that
he
have
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
himself
.
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
post
the
letter
to
the
archbishop
and
,
have
make
that
sure
,
proceed
to
push
the
advantage
which
he
have
gain
.
<EOS>
have
Mrs.
Bold
be
at
home
,
he
would
have
call
on
her
,
but
he
know
that
she
be
at
Plumstead
,
so
he
write
the
follow
note
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
beginning
of
what
,
he
trust
,
may
be
a
long
and
tender
series
of
epistle

dear
MRS
.
<EOS>
BOLD
,
  
<EOS>
You
will
understand
perfectly
that
I
can
not
at
present
correspond
with
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
that
I
could
,
and
hope
the
day
may
be
not
long
distant
when
mist
shall
have
be
clear
away
,
and
we
may
know
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
preclude
myself
from
the
pleasure
of
send
you
these
few
line
to
say
that
Mr.
Q.
have
to
-
day
,
in
my
presence
,
resign
any
title
that
he
ever
have
to
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
,
and
that
the
bishop
have
assure
me
that
it
be
his
intention
to
offer
it
to
your
esteemed
father
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
,
with
my
respectful
compliment
,
ask
him
,
who
I
believe
be
now
a
fellow
-
visitor
with
you
,
to
call
on
the
bishop
either
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday
,
between
ten
and
one
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
be
by
the
bishop
's
desire
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
so
far
oblige
me
as
to
let
me
have
a
line
name
either
day
,
and
the
hour
which
will
suit
Mr.
Harding
,
I
will
take
care
that
the
servant
shall
have
order
to
show
him
in
without
delay
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
say
no
more
 
<EOS>
but
still
I
wish
you
could
make
your
father
understand
that
no
subject
will
be
moot
between
his
lordship
and
him
which
will
refer
at
all
to
the
method
in
which
he
may
choose
to
perform
his
duty
.
<EOS>
I
for
one
be
persuade
that
no
clergyman
could
perform
it
more
satisfactorily
than
he
do
,
or
than
he
will
do
again
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
former
occasion
I
be
indiscreet
and
much
too
impatient
,
consider
your
father
's
age
and
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
now
refuse
my
apology
.
<EOS>
I
still
hope
also
that
with
your
aid
and
sweet
pious
labour
we
may
live
to
attach
such
a
Sabbath
-
school
to
the
old
endowment
as
may
,
by
God
's
grace
and
furtherance
,
be
a
blessing
to
the
poor
of
this
city
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
see
at
once
that
this
letter
be
confidential
.
<EOS>
the
subject
,
of
course
,
make
it
so
.
<EOS>
but
,
equally
,
of
course
,
it
be
for
your
parent
's
eye
as
well
as
for
your
own
,
should
you
think
proper
to
show
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
my
darle
little
friend
Johnny
be
as
strong
as
ever
 
dear
little
fellow
.
<EOS>
do
he
still
continue
his
rude
assault
on
those
beautiful
long
silken
tress
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
your
friend
miss
you
from
Barchester
sorely
,
but
it
would
be
cruel
to
begrudge
you
your
sojourn
among
flower
and
field
during
this
truly
sultry
weather
.
  
<EOS>
pray
believe
me
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
yours
most
sincerely
,
OBADIAH
SLOPE
  
Barchester
,
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
letter
,
take
as
a
whole
,
and
with
the
consideration
that
Mr.
Slope
wish
to
assume
a
great
degree
of
intimacy
with
Eleanor
,
would
not
have
be
bad
but
for
the
allusion
to
the
tress
.
<EOS>
gentleman
do
not
write
to
lady
about
their
tress
unless
they
be
on
very
intimate
term
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
could
not
be
expect
to
be
aware
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
put
a
little
affection
into
his
epistle
,
and
yet
he
think
it
injudicious
,
as
the
letter
would
,
he
know
,
be
show
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
insist
that
the
letter
should
be
strictly
private
and
see
by
no
eye
but
Eleanor
's
own
,
have
he
not
feel
that
such
an
injunction
would
have
be
disobey
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
restrain
his
passion
,
do
not
sign
himself
"
your
affectionately
,
"
and
content
himself
instead
with
the
compliment
to
the
tress
.
  
<EOS>
have
finish
his
letter
,
he
take
it
to
Mrs.
Bold
's
house
and
,
learn
there
,
from
the
servant
,
that
thing
be
to
be
send
out
to
plumstead
that
afternoon
,
leave
it
,
with
many
injunction
,
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
follow
Mr.
Slope
so
as
to
complete
the
day
with
him
and
then
return
to
his
letter
and
its
momentous
fate
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
song
which
give
us
some
very
good
advice
about
court
:
    
<EOS>
It
be
gude
to
be
off
with
the
auld
luve
before
ye
be
on
wi
'
the
new
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
wisdom
of
this
maxim
Mr.
Slope
be
ignorant
,
and
accordingly
,
have
write
his
letter
to
Mrs.
Bold
,
he
proceed
to
call
upon
the
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
hard
to
say
which
be
the
old
love
and
which
the
new
,
Mr.
Slope
have
be
smite
with
both
so
nearly
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
think
it
not
amiss
to
have
two
string
to
his
bow
.
<EOS>
but
two
string
to
Cupid
's
bow
be
always
dangerous
to
him
on
whose
behalf
they
be
to
be
use
.
<EOS>
a
man
should
remember
that
between
two
stool
he
may
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
sooth
Mr.
Slope
be
pursue
Mrs.
Bold
in
obedience
to
his
well
instinct
,
and
the
signora
in
obedience
to
his
worser
.
<EOS>
have
he
win
the
widow
and
wear
her
,
no
one
could
have
blame
him
.
<EOS>
You
,
o
reader
,
and
I
,
and
Eleanor
's
other
friend
would
have
receive
the
story
of
such
a
winning
with
much
disgust
and
disappointment
,
but
we
should
have
be
angry
with
Eleanor
,
not
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Bishop
,
male
and
female
,
dean
and
chapter
and
diocesan
clergy
in
full
congress
could
have
find
nothing
to
disapprove
of
in
such
an
alliance
.
<EOS>
convocation
itself
,
that
mysterious
and
mighty
synod
,
could
in
no
wise
have
fall
foul
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
possession
of
£
1000
a
year
and
a
beautiful
wife
would
not
at
all
have
hurt
the
voice
of
the
pulpit
charmer
,
or
lessen
the
grace
and
piety
of
the
exemplary
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
of
such
a
nature
be
likely
to
be
his
dealing
with
the
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
he
know
that
her
husband
be
live
,
and
therefore
he
could
not
woo
her
honestly
.
<EOS>
then
again
she
have
nothing
to
recommend
her
to
his
honest
wooing
,
have
such
be
possible
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
only
portionless
,
but
also
from
misfortune
unfitted
to
be
choose
as
the
wife
of
any
man
who
want
a
useful
mate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
aware
that
she
be
a
helpless
,
hopeless
cripple
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
wrong
in
devote
his
time
to
the
back
drawing
-
room
in
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
what
take
place
there
would
,
if
divulge
,
utterly
ruin
him
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
scandal
would
soon
come
upon
his
heel
and
spread
abroad
among
the
black
coat
of
Barchester
some
tiding
,
exaggerated
tiding
,
of
the
sigh
which
he
pour
into
the
lady
's
ear
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
act
against
the
recognize
principle
of
his
life
,
against
those
law
of
conduct
by
which
he
hope
to
achieve
much
high
success
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
we
have
say
,
he
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
passion
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
passion
be
too
strong
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
signora
,
no
such
plea
can
be
put
forward
for
her
,
for
in
truth
she
care
no
more
for
Mr.
Slope
than
she
do
for
twenty
other
who
have
be
at
her
foot
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
willingly
,
nay
greedily
,
accept
his
homage
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
fine
fly
that
Barchester
have
hitherto
afford
to
her
web
,
and
the
signora
be
a
powerful
spider
that
make
wondrous
webs
,
and
could
in
no
way
live
without
catch
fly
.
<EOS>
Her
taste
in
this
respect
be
abominable
,
for
she
have
no
use
for
the
victim
when
catch
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
eat
them
matrimonially
,
as
young
lady
fly
do
whose
webs
be
most
frequently
of
their
mother
"
weaving
.
<EOS>
nor
could
she
devour
them
by
any
escapade
of
a
less
legitimate
description
.
<EOS>
Her
unfortunate
affliction
preclude
her
from
all
hope
of
levant
with
a
lover
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
run
away
with
a
lady
who
require
three
servant
to
move
her
from
a
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
the
signora
be
subdue
by
no
passion
.
<EOS>
Her
time
for
love
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
have
live
out
her
heart
,
such
heart
as
she
have
ever
have
,
in
her
early
year
,
at
an
age
when
Mr.
Slope
be
think
of
the
second
book
of
Euclid
and
his
unpaid
bill
at
the
buttery
hatch
.
<EOS>
in
age
the
lady
be
young
than
the
gentleman
,
but
in
feeling
,
in
knowledge
of
the
affair
of
love
,
in
intrigue
,
he
be
immeasurably
her
junior
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
her
to
have
some
man
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
one
customary
excitement
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
delight
in
the
exercise
of
power
which
this
give
her
;
it
be
now
nearly
the
only
food
for
her
ambition
;
she
would
boast
to
her
sister
that
she
could
make
a
fool
of
any
man
,
and
the
sister
,
as
little
imbue
with
feminine
delicacy
as
herself
,
good
-
naturedly
think
it
but
fair
that
such
amusement
should
be
afford
to
a
poor
invalid
who
be
debar
from
the
ordinary
pleasure
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
madly
in
love
but
hardly
know
it
.
<EOS>
the
Signora
spit
him
,
as
a
boy
do
a
cockchafer
on
a
cork
,
that
she
may
enjoy
the
energetic
agony
of
his
gyration
.
<EOS>
and
she
know
very
well
what
she
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
add
to
his
person
all
such
adornment
as
be
possible
to
a
clergyman
make
a
morning
visit
 
such
as
a
clean
necktie
,
clean
handkerchief
,
new
glove
,
and
a
_
soupçon
_
of
not
unnecessary
scent
 
call
about
three
o'clock
at
the
doctor
's
door
.
<EOS>
at
about
this
hour
the
signora
be
almost
always
alone
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
mother
have
not
come
down
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
out
or
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
Bertie
be
out
,
and
Charlotte
at
any
rate
leave
the
room
if
anyone
call
whose
object
be
specially
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
idea
of
be
charitable
and
sisterly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
as
be
his
custom
,
ask
for
Mr.
Stanhope
,
and
be
tell
,
as
be
the
servant
's
custom
,
that
the
signora
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
upstairs
he
accordingly
go
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
,
as
he
always
do
,
lie
on
her
sofa
with
a
french
volume
before
her
and
a
beautiful
little
inlaid
writing
-
case
open
on
her
table
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
of
his
entrance
she
be
in
the
act
of
writing
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
friend
,
"
say
she
,
put
out
her
left
hand
to
him
across
her
desk
,
"
I
do
not
expect
you
to
-
day
and
be
this
very
instant
writing
to
you
 
"
  
Mr.
Slope
,
take
the
soft
,
fair
,
delicate
hand
in
his
 
and
very
soft
and
fair
and
delicate
<EOS>
it
be
 
<EOS>
bow
over
it
his
huge
red
head
and
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sight
to
see
,
a
deed
to
record
if
the
author
could
fitly
do
it
,
a
picture
to
put
on
canvas
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
big
,
awkward
,
cumbrous
,
and
,
have
his
heart
in
his
pursuit
,
be
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
fair
,
as
we
have
say
,
and
delicate
;
everything
about
her
be
fine
and
refined
;
her
hand
in
his
look
like
a
rose
lie
among
carrot
,
and
when
he
kiss
it
,
he
look
as
a
cow
may
do
on
find
such
a
flower
among
her
food
.
<EOS>
She
be
graceful
as
a
couchant
goddess
and
,
moreover
,
as
self
-
possess
as
Venus
must
have
be
when
court
Adonis
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
that
such
grace
and
such
beauty
should
have
condescend
to
waste
itself
on
such
a
pursuit
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
the
act
of
write
to
you
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
now
my
scrawl
may
go
into
the
basket
;
"
and
she
raise
the
sheet
of
gild
note
-
paper
from
off
her
desk
as
though
to
tear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
it
shall
not
,
"
say
he
,
lay
the
embargo
of
half
a
stone
weight
of
human
flesh
and
blood
upon
the
devoted
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nothing
that
you
write
for
my
eye
,
signora
,
shall
be
so
desecrated
,
"
and
he
take
up
the
letter
,
put
that
also
among
the
carrot
and
feed
on
it
,
and
then
proceed
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
hope
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
keep
all
the
trash
I
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
half
my
time
I
do
not
know
what
I
write
,
and
when
I
do
,
I
know
it
be
only
fit
for
the
back
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
that
ugly
trick
of
keep
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
at
any
rate
,
I
do
not
throw
them
into
a
waste
-
paper
basket
.
<EOS>
if
destruction
be
their
doom
lot
,
they
perish
worthily
,
and
be
burn
on
a
pyre
,
as
Dido
be
of
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
a
steel
pen
stick
through
them
,
of
course
,
"
say
she
,
"
to
make
the
simile
more
complete
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
lady
of
my
acquaintance
I
think
Lady
Dido
be
the
most
absurd
.
<EOS>
why
do
she
not
do
as
Cleopatra
do
?
<EOS>
why
do
she
not
take
out
her
ship
and
insist
on
go
with
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
lose
the
land
she
have
get
by
a
swindle
,
and
then
she
could
not
bear
the
loss
of
her
lover
.
<EOS>
so
she
fall
between
two
stool
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
whatever
you
do
,
never
mingle
love
and
business
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
blush
up
to
his
eye
and
over
his
mottled
forehead
to
the
very

of
his
hair

<EOS>
He
feel
sure
that
the
signora
know
all
about
his
intention
with
reference
to
Mrs
Bold
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
tell
him
that
he
be
detect
.
<EOS>
His
doom
be
to
be
speak
;
he
be
to
be
punish
for
his
duplicity
,
and
reject
by
the
beautiful
creature
before
him
.
<EOS>
poor
man
.
<EOS>
He
little
dreamt
that
have
all
his
intention
with
reference
to
Mrs.
Bold
be
know
to
the
signora
,
it
would
only
have
add
zest
to
that
lady
's
amusement
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
have
Mr.
Slope
at
her
foot
,
to
show
her
power
by
make
an
utter
fool
of
a
clergyman
,
to
gratify
her
own
infidelity
by
thus
prove
the
little
strength
which
religion
have
in
control
the
passion
even
of
a
religious
man
;
but
it
would
be
an
increase
gratification
if
she
could
be
make
to
understand
that
she
be
at
the
same
time
allure
her
victim
away
from
another
,
whose
love
if
secure
would
be
in
every
way
beneficent
and
salutary
.
  
<EOS>
the
Signora
have
indeed
discover
,
with
the
keen
instinct
of
such
a
woman
,
that
Mr.
Slope
be
bent
on
matrimony
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
but
in
allude
to
Dido
she
have
not
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
perceive
,
however
,
from
her
lover
's
blush
,
what
be
on
his
mind
and
be
not
slow
in
take
advantage
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
him
full
in
the
face
,
not
angrily
,
nor
yet
with
a
smile
,
but
with
an
intense
and
overpowering
gaze
;
then
,
hold
up
her
forefinger
and
slightly
shake
her
head
,
she
say
:
    
<EOS>
"
whatever
you
do

my
friend

do
not
mingle
love

<EOS>
either
stick
to

your
city
of

,
or
else
follow
your

like
a
true

<EOS>
but
never
attempt
both
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
you
will
have

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
not
so
ready
with
a
pathetic
answer
as
he
usually
be
with
touching
episode
in
his
extempore
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
ought
to
say
something
pretty
,
something
also
that
should
remove
the
impression
on
the
mind
of
his
lady
-
love
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
rather
put
about
how
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
love
,
"
say
he
,
"
true
overpowering
love
,
must
be
the
strong
passion
a
man
can
feel
;
it
must
control
every
other
wish
,
and
put
aside
every
other
pursuit
.
<EOS>
but
with
me
love
will
never
act
in
that
way
unless
it
be
return

"
and
he
throw
upon
the
signora
a
look
of
tenderness
which
be
intend
to
make
up
for
all
the
deficiency
of
his
speech

<EOS>
"

my

up

Pshaw

You

nothing

He
have
audacity

he

not
audacity

"
after
all

there
be
very
little
that

false

anything
that
the

say

<EOS>
if
Mr.

allow
himself

it

his
own

<EOS>
nothing
could
have
be
more
open

<EOS>
the
little

table

a
barrier

against

She

sit

nearly
upright

She
withdraw

angrily

no

you

ghastly
love

mine

"
Your
love
should
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
dream

say
Mr.

,
not
quite
clear
as

the
meaning

Mr.

<EOS>
poor
fellow

<EOS>
She
be
very
cruel

<EOS>
He
go
round
again
upon

He
try

however

to
smile

gently
accuse

joke
on
a
matter

to
him
of
such
vital
moment

<EOS>

why
 
what
gull
do
you
man
make
of

she

how
you
fool

<EOS>
Mr.

do
look
at

with
a
languishing
love
eye

as
he
do
so
he
again
put
forth
his
hand
to
get
hold
of
her

<EOS>
"
I
tell
you

confine

well

<EOS>
now
look
me
in

Mr.

<EOS>
be
I
to
understand
that
you

<EOS>
Mr.

never
have
say
so

<EOS>
if
he
have
come
there
with
any
form
plan
at
all
,
his
intention
be
to
make
love
to
the
lady
without
utter
any
such
declaration
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
quite
impossible
that
he
should
now
deny
his

<EOS>
He
have
,
therefore
,
nothing
for
it
<EOS>
but
to
go
down
on
his
knee
distractedly
against
the
sofa

swear
that

do
love
her

a
love
pass
the
love

assurance

very

palpitation

Poor
Mr.

go
round
and
round
in
mortal
agony

<EOS>
in
such
a
condition
as
his
it
be
really
very
hard
for
him
to
know
what
answer
to
give
.
<EOS>
and
yet
no
answer
would
be
his
sure
condemnation
.
<EOS>
He
may
as
well
at
once
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
bring
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
do
you
accuse
me
of
such
dissimulation

say
he

<EOS>
"
dissimulation

<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
dissimulation

<EOS>
I
make
no
charge
against
you

make
none

<EOS>
pray
do
not
defend
yourself

You
swear
that
you
be
devoted

my
beauty

yet
you
be
on
the
eve
of
matrimony
with
another

<EOS>
I
feel
this
to
be
rather
a
compliment

<EOS>
It
be
to
Mrs.
Bold
that
you
must
defend
yourself
.
<EOS>
that
you
may
find
difficult

you

keep
her

<EOS>

I

not

<EOS>
and
as
he

it
he
almost
hate

an
exquisite
hatred

the
woman
whom
he
could
not
help
love

an
exquisite
love

surely
you

<EOS>

I

say
Mr.

to

the
word
worshipper

peculiarly
distasteful

<EOS>
the

have
conceive
that
it
would
be
so

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that

do
you
not

the
perfection

let
me
give
you
advice

<EOS>
marry
the
charming
widow

she
will
be
a
good
mother
to
your

an
excellent
mistress
of

household

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

how
can
you
be
so
cruel

<EOS>
"
cruel

she
,
change
the
voice
of
banter
which
she
have
be
use
for
one
which
be
expressively
earnest
in
its
tone

"
be
that
cruelty

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
love
another
while
my

be
entirely
your
own

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
cruelty

Mr.

what
may
you
say
of

I
return

you
think

I
bind
you
even

to
do
daily
penance

can
I
give

,
you
have
not
realize
the
condition
of
my
fate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
not
on
his
knee
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
after
his
declaration
of
love
,
he
have
rise
from
them
as
quickly
as
he
think
consistent
with
the
new
position
which
he
now
fill
,
and
as
he
stand
be
lean
on
the
back
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
this
outburst
of
tenderness
on
the
signora
's
part
quite
overcome
him
and
make
him
feel
for
the
moment
that
he
could
sacrifice
everything
to
be
assure
of
the
love
of
the
beautiful
creature
before
him
,
maim
,
lame
,
and
already
married
as
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
can
I
not
sympathize
with
your
lot
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
now
seat
himself
on
her
sofa
and
push
away
the
table
with
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sympathy
be
so
near
to
pity
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
pity
me
,
cripple
as
I
be
,
I
shall
spurn
you
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Madeline
,
I
will
only
love
you
,
"
and
again
he
catch
her
hand
and
devour
it
with
kiss
.
<EOS>
now
she
do
not
draw
it
from
him
,
but
sit
there
as
he
kiss
it
,
look
at
him
with
her
great
eye
,
just
as
a
great
spider
would
look
at
a
great
fly
that
be
quite
securely
catch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
Signor
Neroni
be
to
come
to
Barchester
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
make
his
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Signor
Neroni
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
introduce
him
to
the
bishop
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
the
young
lady
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
again
have
recourse
to
that
horrid
quiz
voice
which
Mr.
Slope
so
particularly
hate
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
it
be
necessary
that
you
should
know
that
there
be
a
Signor
Neroni
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
think
that
you
retain
for
that
wretch
one
particle
of
the
love
of
which
he
be
never
worthy
,
I
would
die
before
I
would
distract
you
by
tell
you
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
be
your
husband
the
master
of
your
heart
<EOS>
,
I
may
perhaps
love
you
,
but
you
should
never
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
again
!
<EOS>
how
you
talk
.
<EOS>
and
you
consider
then
that
if
a
husband
be
not
master
of
his
wife
's
heart
,
he
have
no
right
to
her
fealty
;
if
a
wife
cease
to
love
,
she
may
cease
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
be
that
your
doctrine
on
this
matter
,
as
a
minister
of
the
Church
of
England
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
try
hard
within
himself
to
cast
off
the
pollution
with
which
he
feel
that
he
be
defile
his
soul
.
<EOS>
He
strove
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
noxious
siren
that
have
bewitch
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
again
heart
free
.
<EOS>
He
have
look
for
rapturous
joy
in
love
this
lovely
creature
,
and
he
already
find
that
he
meet
with
little
but
disappointment
and
self
-
rebuke
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
across
the
fruit
of
the
Dead
Sea
,
so
sweet
and
delicious
to
the
eye
,
so
bitter
and
nauseous
to
the
taste
.
<EOS>
He
have
put
the
apple
to
his
mouth
,
and
it
have
turn
to
ashe
between
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
yet
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
he
could
not
but
know
,
that
she
jeer
at
him
,
ridicule
his
love
,
and
insult
the
weakness
of
his
religion
.
<EOS>
but
she
half
-
permit
his
adoration
,
and
that
half
-
permission
add
such
fuel
to
his
fire
that
all
the
fountain
of
his
piety
could
not
quench
it
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
feel
savage
,
irritated
,
and
revengeful
.
<EOS>
He
meditate
some
severity
of
speech
,
some
taunt
that
should
cut
her
,
as
her
taunt
cut
him
.
<EOS>
He
reflect
as
he
stand
there
for
a
moment
,
silent
before
her
,
that
if
he
desire
to
quell
her
proud
spirit
,
he
should
do
so
by
be
prouder
even
than
herself
;
that
if
he
wish
to
have
her
at
his
foot
suppliant
for
his
love
,
it
behove
him
to
conquer
her
by
indifference
.
<EOS>
all
this
pass
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
dead
knowledge
go
,
he
know
,
or
think
he
know
,
how
a
woman
should
be
tame
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
essay
to
bring
his
tactic
to
bear
,
he
fail
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
what
chance
have
dead
knowledge
with
experience
in
any
of
the
transaction
between
man
and
man
?
<EOS>
what
possible
chance
between
man
and
woman
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
love
furiously
,
insanely
and
truly
,
but
he
have
never
play
the
game
of
love
.
<EOS>
the
signora
do
not
love
at
all
,
but
she
be
up
to
every
move
of
the
board
.
<EOS>
It
be
Philidor
pit
against
a
schoolboy
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
she
continue
to
insult
him
,
and
he
continue
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
sacrifice
the
world
for
love
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
in
answer
to
some
renew
vapid
declaration
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
"
how
often
have
the
same
thing
be
say
,
and
how
invariably
with
the
same
falsehood
!
"
  
"
falsehood

"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
say
that
I
be
false
to
you

<EOS>
do
you
say
that
my
love

not
real

"
  
<EOS>
"
false
?
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
false
,
false
as
the
father
of
falsehood
 
if
indeed
falsehood
need
a
sire
and
be
not
self

begotten
since
the
world

<EOS>
You
be
ready
to
sacrifice
the
world
for
love

<EOS>
come
let
us
see
what
you
will
sacrifice

<EOS>
I
care
nothing

I
swear

so
base
that
he
can
only

repulsive
disgust

<EOS>
in
the
council

of
my
heart
I
have
divorce

<EOS>
to
me
that
be
as
good

licentious
life

<EOS>
I
care
nothing
for
what
the
world
can
say
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
as
frank
?
<EOS>
Will
you
take
me
to
your
home
as
your
wife

<EOS>
Will
you
call
me
Mrs.
Slope

and
prebendary

<EOS>
"
the
poor
tortured
wretch
stand
silent
,
not

what
to

.
<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
tell
me
,
then
,
what
part

"
  
<EOS>
"
be

<EOS>
"
I
be
free

say
she
,
almost
start
up
in
her
energy
.
<EOS>
for
though
there
be
no
truth
in
her
pretended
regard
for
her
clerical
admirer
,
there
be
a
mixture
of
real
feeling
in
the
scorn
and
satire
with
which
she
speak
of
love
and
marriage
generally
.
<EOS>
"
I

and
prove
yourself
a
true
man

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
should
have
take
her
at
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
draw
back
,
and
he
would
have
have
the
full
advantage
of
the
offer
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
instead
of
do
so
,
he
stand
wrapt
in
astonishment
,
pass
his
finger
through
his
lank
red
hair
and
thinking
,
as
he
stare
upon
her
animate
countenance

that

she
laugh
out
loud

"
come

Mr.

,
do
not
talk

<EOS>
People
beyond
one

twenty
should
never
dream
of
such
a

<EOS>
You
and
I
,
if

have
the

of
any
love
leave
in
us
,
if
we
have
the
remnant
of
a
passion
remain
in

We

<EOS>
come
,
confess
;
on
second
thought
you
would
not
sacrifice
such
thing
for
the
smile
of
a
lame
lady

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
answer
this
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
be
in
any
way
dignified
,
he
feel
that
he
must
be
silent

<EOS>
"
come

<EOS>
and
she
again
put
out
her
hand
to
him

<EOS>
He
sit
himself
down
in
the

beside

take
her
proffered

leant
over

<EOS>
"

He
kiss

stretch
over

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
Mr.

I
will
teach

at
any

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
say
but
little
on
the
subject
of
Sabbath
-
school
,
but
he
make
his
adieu
,
and
betook
himself
home
with
a
sad
heart
,
trouble
mind
,
and
uneasy
conscience
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
be
entertain
by
Dr.
and
Mrs.
grantly
at
plumstead
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
Mr.
Slope
,
when
leave
his
_
billet
-
doux
_
at
the
house
of
Mrs.
Bold
,
have
be
inform
that
it
would
be
send
out
to
her
at
plumstead
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Harding
have
in
fact
come
into
town
together
in
the
brougham
,
and
it
have
be
arrange
that
they
should
call
for
Eleanor
's
parcel
as
they
leave
on
their
way
home
.
<EOS>
accordingly
they
do
so
call
,
and
the
maid
,
as
she
hand
to
the
coachman
a
small
basket
and
large
bundle
carefully
and
neatly
pack
,
give
in
at
the
carriage
window
Mr.
Slope
's
epistle
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
who
be
sit
next
to
the
window
,
take
it
and
immediately
recognize
the
hand
-
writing
of
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
leave
this
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
call
with
it
himself
,
your
reverence
,
"
say
the
girl
,
"
and
be
very
anxious
that
Missus
should
have
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
the
brougham
drive
off
,
and
the
letter
be
leave
in
the
archdeacon
's
hand
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
it
as
though
he
hold
a
basket
of
adder
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
think
bad
of
the
document
have
he
read
it
and
discover
it
to
be
licentious
and
atheistical
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
moreover
,
what
so
many
wise
people
be
accustomed
to
do
in
similar
circumstance
;
he
immediately
condemn
the
person
to
whom
the
letter
be
write
,
as
though
she
be
necessarily
a
_
particeps
crimini
_
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
,
though
by
no
mean
incline
to
forward
Mr.
Slope
's
intimacy
with
his
daughter
,
would
have
give
anything
to
have
keep
the
letter
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
now
impossible
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
in
his
hand
,
and
he
look
as
thoroughly
disgust
as
though
he
be
quite
sure
that
it
contain
all
the
rhapsody
of
a
favoured
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
hard
on
me
,
"
say
he
after
awhile
,
"
that
this
should
go
on
under
my
roof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
here
the
archdeacon
be
certainly
most
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
have
invite
his
sister
-
in
-
law
to
his
house
,
it
be
a
natural
consequence
that
she
should
receive
her
letter
there
.
<EOS>
and
if
Mr.
Slope
choose
to
write
to
her
,
his
letter
would
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
be
send
after
her
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
very
fact
of
an
invitation
to
one
's
house
imply
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
inviter
.
<EOS>
He
have
show
that
he
think
Mrs.
Bold
to
be
a
fit
person
to
stay
with
him
by
his
ask
her
to
do
so
,
and
it
be
most
cruel
to
her
that
he
should
complain
of
her
violate
the
sanctity
of
his
roof
-
tree
,
when
the
lache
commit
be
none
of
her
committing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
feel
this
,
and
feel
also
that
when
the
archdeacon
talk
thus
about
his
roof
,
what
he
say
be
most
offensive
to
himself
as
Eleanor
's
father
.
<EOS>
if
Eleanor
do
receive
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
,
what
be
there
in
that
to
pollute
the
purity
of
Dr.
Grantly
's
household
?
<EOS>
He
be
indignant
that
his
daughter
should
be
so
judge
and
so
spoken
of
,
and
he
make
up
his
mind
that
even
as
Mrs.
Slope
she
must
be
dearer
to
him
than
any
other
creature
on
God
's
earth
.
<EOS>
He
almost
break
out
and
say
as
much
,
but
for
the
moment
he
restrain
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
hand
the
offensive
missile
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
I
be
not
go
to
be
the
bearer
of
his
love
-
letter
.
<EOS>
You
be
her
father
and
may
do
as
you
think
fit
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
do
as
he
think
fit
with
it
,
the
archdeacon
certainly
mean
that
Mr.
Harding
would
be
justify
in
opening
and
read
the
letter
,
and
take
any
step
which
may
in
consequence
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
Dr.
Grantly
do
feel
rather
a
strong
curiosity
than
be
justify
by
his
outraged
virtue
to
see
the
content
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
could
not
open
it
himself
,
but
he
wish
to
make
Mr.
Harding
understand
that
he
,
as
Eleanor
's
father
,
would
be
fully
justify
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
such
a
proceeding
never
occur
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
His
authority
over
Eleanor
cease
when
she
become
the
wife
of
John
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
slight
wish
to
pry
into
her
correspondence
.
<EOS>
He
consequently
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
,
and
only
wish
that
he
have
be
able
to
do
so
without
the
archdeacon
's
knowledge
.
<EOS>
They
both
sit
silent
during
half
the
journey
home
,
and
then
Dr.
Grantly
say
,
"
perhaps
Susan
have
better
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
explain
to
her
sister
better
than
either
you
or
I
can
do
how
deep
be
the
disgrace
of
such
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
very
hard
upon
Eleanor
,
"
reply
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
allow
that
she
have
disgrace
herself
,
nor
do
I
think
it
likely
that
she
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
right
to
correspond
with
whom
she
please
,
and
I
shall
not
take
upon
myself
to
blame
her
because
she
get
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
say
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
you
do
not
wish
her
to
marry
the
man
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
admit
that
she
would
disgrace
herself
if
she
do
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
her
to
marry
him
,
"
say
the
perplex
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
him
,
and
do
not
think
he
would
make
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
but
if
Eleanor
choose
to
do
so
,
I
shall
certainly
not
think
that
she
disgrace
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
exclaim
Dr.
Grantly
and
throw
himself
back
into
the
corner
of
his
brougham
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
say
nothing
more
,
but
commence
play
a
dirge
with
an
imaginary
fiddle
bow
upon
an
imaginary
violoncello
,
for
which
there
do
not
appear
to
be
quite
room
enough
in
the
carriage
;
he
continue
the
tune
,
with
sundry
variation
,
till
he
arrive
at
the
rectory
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
be
meditate
sad
thing
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
always
look
on
his
father
-
in
-
law
as
a
true
partisan
,
though
he
know
him
to
be
a
man
devoid
of
all
the
combative
qualification
for
that
character
.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
no
fear
that
Mr.
Harding
would
go
over
to
the
enemy
,
though
he
have
never
count
much
on
the
ex
-
warden
's
prowess
in
break
the
hostile
rank
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
it
seem
that
Eleanor
,
with
her
wile
,
have
completely
trepan
and
bewilder
her
father
,
cheat
him
out
of
his
judgement
,
rob
him
of
the
predilection
and
taste
of
his
life
,
and
cause
him
to
be
tolerant
of
a
man
whose
arrogance
and
vulgarity
would
,
a
few
year
since
,
have
be
unendurable
to
him
.
<EOS>
that
the
whole
thing
be
as
good
as
arrange
between
Eleanor
and
Mr.
Slope
<EOS>
there
be
no
longer
any
room
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Harding
know
that
such
be
the
case
,
even
this
could
hardly
be
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
manifest
that
he
at
any
rate
suspect
it
and
be
prepared
to
sanction
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
dislike
Mr.
Slope
as
much
as
it
be
in
his
nature
to
dislike
any
man
.
<EOS>
have
his
daughter
wish
to
do
her
bad
to
displease
him
by
a
second
marriage
,
she
could
hardly
have
succeed
better
than
by
marry
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
say
to
himself
now
very
often
,
what
right
have
he
to
condemn
her
if
she
do
nothing
that
be
really
wrong
?
<EOS>
if
she
like
Mr.
Slope
,
it
be
her
affair
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
miraculous
to
him
that
a
woman
with
such
a
mind
,
so
educated
,
so
refined
,
so
nice
in
her
taste
,
should
like
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
then
he
ask
himself
whether
it
be
possible
that
she
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
ah
,
thou
weak
man
;
most
charitable
,
most
christian
,
but
weak
of
man
!
<EOS>
why
could
not
thou
not
have
ask
herself
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
the
daughter
of
thy
loin
,
the
child
of
thy
heart
,
the
good
beloved
to
thee
of
all
humanity
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
prove
to
thee
,
by
year
of
close
affection
,
her
truth
and
goodness
and
filial
obedience
?
<EOS>
and
yet
,
know
and
feel
all
this
,
thou
couldst
endure
to
go
grope
in
darkness
,
hear
her
name
in
strain
which
wound
thy
loving
heart
,
and
be
unable
to
defend
her
as
thou
shouldst
have
do
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
not
believe
,
do
not
believe
,
that
his
daughter
mean
to
marry
this
man
,
but
he
fear
to
commit
himself
to
such
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
if
she
do
do
it
there
would
be
then
no
means
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
the
wish
of
his
heart
be
:
first
,
that
there
should
be
no
truth
in
the
archdeacon
's
surmise
;
and
in
this
wish
he
would
have
fain
trust
entirely
,
have
he
dare
so
to
do
;
secondly
,
that
the
match
may
be
prevent
,
if
unfortunately
,
it
have
be
contemplate
by
Eleanor
;
thirdly
,
that
should
she
be
so
infatuated
as
to
marry
this
man
,
he
may
justify
his
conduct
and
declare
that
no
cause
exist
for
his
separate
himself
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
want
to
believe
her
incapable
of
such
a
marriage
;
he
want
to
show
that
he
so
believe
of
her
;
but
he
want
also
to
be
able
to
say
hereafter
that
she
have
do
nothing
amiss
,
if
she
should
unfortunately
prove
herself
to
be
different
from
what
he
think
her
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
but
affection
could
justify
such
fickleness
,
but
affection
do
justify
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
little
of
the
roman
about
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
sacrifice
his
Lucretia
even
though
she
should
be
pollute
by
the
accept
address
of
the
clerical
Tarquin
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
if
Tarquin
could
be
prevent
,
well
and
good
,
but
if
not
,
the
father
would
still
open
his
heart
to
his
daughter
and
accept
her
as
she
present
herself
,
Tarquin
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
's
mind
be
of
a
strong
calibre
,
and
he
be
by
no
mean
deficient
in
heart
.
<EOS>
He
love
with
an
honest
genuine
love
his
wife
and
child
and
friend
.
<EOS>
He
love
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
be
quite
prepared
to
love
Eleanor
too
,
if
she
would
be
one
of
his
party
,
if
she
would
be
on
his
side
,
if
she
would
regard
the
Slopes
and
the
proudie
as
the
enemy
of
mankind
and
acknowledge
and
feel
the
comfortable
merit
of
the
Gwynnes
and
Arabins
.
<EOS>
He
wish
to
be
what
he
call
"
safe
"
with
all
those
whom
he
have
admit
to
the
penetralia
of
his
house
and
heart
.
<EOS>
He
could
luxuriate
in
no
society
that
be
deficient
in
a
certain
feeling
of
faithful
,
staunch
High
Churchism
,
which
to
him
be
tantamount
to
freemasonry
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
strict
in
his
line
of
definition
.
<EOS>
He
endure
without
impatience
many
different
shade
of
anglo
-
church
conservatism
;
but
with
the
Slopes
and
Proudies
he
could
not
go
on
all
four
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
want
in
,
moreover
,
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
,
he
be
not
trouble
by
that
womanly
tenderness
which
be
so
peculiar
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
towards
his
friend
be
that
while
they
stick
to
him
,
he
would
stick
to
them
;
that
he
would
work
with
them
shoulder
and
shoulder
;
that
he
would
be
faithful
to
the
faithful
.
<EOS>
He
know
nothing
of
that
beautiful
love
which
can
be
true
to
a
false
friend
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
these
two
man
,
each
miserable
enough
in
his
own
way
,
return
to
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
get
late
when
they
arrive
there
,
and
the
lady
have
already
go
up
to
dress
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
as
the
two
part
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Harding
pass
to
his
own
room
he
knock
at
Eleanor
's
door
and
hand
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
hurry
to
his
own
territory
,
there
to
unburden
his
heart
to
his
faithful
partner
.
  
<EOS>
what
colloquy
take
place
between
the
marital
chamber
and
the
adjoining
dressing
-
room
shall
not
be
detail
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
now
intimate
with
the
person
concern
,
can
well
imagine
it
.
<EOS>
the
whole
tenor
of
it
also
may
be
read
in
Mrs.
Grantly
's
brow
as
she
come
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
when
she
receive
the
letter
from
her
father
's
hand
,
have
no
idea
from
whom
it
come
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
Mr.
Slope
's
handwriting
,
or
if
so
have
forget
it
,
and
do
not
think
of
him
as
she
twist
the
letter
as
people
do
twist
letter
when
they
do
not
immediately
recognize
their
correspondent
either
by
the
writing
or
the
seal
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
at
her
glass
,
brush
her
hair
and
rise
every
other
minute
to
play
with
her
boy
,
who
be
sprawl
on
the
bed
and
who
engage
pretty
nearly
the
whole
attention
of
the
maid
as
well
as
of
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
sit
before
her
toilet
-
table
,
she
break
the
seal
and
,
turn
over
the
leaf
,
see
Mr.
Slope
's
name
.
<EOS>
She
first
feel
surprised
,
and
then
annoy
,
and
then
anxious
.
<EOS>
as
she
read
it
she
become
interested
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
delighted
to
find
that
all
obstacle
to
her
father
's
return
to
the
hospital
be
apparently
remove
that
she
do
not
observe
the
fulsome
language
in
which
the
tiding
be
convey
.
<EOS>
She
merely
perceive
that
she
be
commission
to
tell
her
father
that
such
be
the
case
,
and
she
do
not
realize
the
fact
that
such
a
communication
should
not
have
be
make
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
her
by
an
unmarried
young
clergyman
.
<EOS>
She
feel
,
on
the
whole
,
grateful
to
Mr.
Slope
and
anxious
to
get
on
her
dress
that
she
may
run
with
the
news
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
then
she
come
to
the
allusion
to
her
own
pious
labour
,
and
she
say
in
her
heart
that
Mr.
Slope
be
an
affected
ass
.
<EOS>
then
she
go
on
again
and
be
offend
by
her
boy
be
call
Mr.
Slope
's
darling
 
<EOS>
he
be
nobody
's
darling
but
her
own
,
or
at
any
rate
not
the
darling
of
a
disagreeable
stranger
like
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
lastly
she
arrive
at
the
tress
and
feel
a
qualm
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
in
the
glass
,
and
there
they
be
before
her
,
long
and
silken
,
certainly
,
and
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
but
that
she
know
them
to
be
so
,
but
she
feel
angry
with
them
and
brush
them
roughly
and
carelessly
.
<EOS>
She
crumple
the
letter
up
with
angry
violence
,
and
resolve
,
almost
without
think
of
it
,
that
she
would
not
show
it
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
would
merely
tell
him
the
content
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
then
comfort
herself
again
with
her
boy
,
have
her
dress
fasten
,
and
go
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
trip
down
the
stair
she
begin
to
ascertain
that
there
be
some
difficulty
in
her
situation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
keep
from
her
father
the
news
about
the
hospital
,
nor
could
she
comfortably
confess
the
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
before
the
Grantlys
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
already
go
down
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
his
step
upon
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
therefore
to
take
him
aside
and
tell
him
her
little
bit
of
news
.
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
She
have
no
idea
how
severely
the
unfortunate
letter
have
already
be
discuss
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
whole
party
be
there
,
include
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
the
whole
party
look
glum
and
sour
.
<EOS>
the
two
girl
sit
silent
and
apart
as
though
they
be
aware
that
something
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
even
Mr.
Arabin
be
solemn
and
silent
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
not
see
him
since
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
the
whole
day
at
St.
Ewold
's
,
and
such
have
be
the
case
,
it
be
natural
that
he
should
tell
how
matter
be
go
on
there
.
<EOS>
He
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
however
,
but
remain
solemn
and
silent
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
solemn
and
silent
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
know
in
her
heart
that
they
have
be
talk
about
her
,
and
her
heart
misgave
her
as
she
think
of
Mr.
Slope
and
his
letter
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
she
feel
it
to
be
quite
impossible
to
speak
to
her
father
alone
while
matter
be
in
this
state
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
be
soon
announce
,
and
Dr.
Grantly
,
as
be
his
will
not
,
give
Eleanor
his
arm
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
so
as
though
the
do
it
be
an
outrage
on
his
feeling
render
necessary
by
sternest
necessity
.
<EOS>
with
quick
sympathy
Eleanor
feel
this
,
and
hardly
put
her
finger
on
his
coat
-
sleeve
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
guess
in
what
way
the
dinner
-
hour
be
pass
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
say
a
few
word
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
Mr.
Arabin
say
a
few
word
to
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
she
say
a
few
word
to
her
father
,
and
he
try
to
say
a
few
word
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
be
try
and
find
guilty
of
something
,
though
she
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
say
out
to
them
all
,
"
well
,
what
be
it
that
I
have
do
;
out
with
it
,
and
let
me
know
my
crime
;
for
heaven
's
sake
let
me
hear
the
bad
of
it
;
"
but
she
could
not
.
<EOS>
She
could
say
nothing
,
but
sit
there
silent
,
half
-
feeling
that
she
be
guilty
,
and
try
in
vain
to
pretend
even
to
eat
her
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
cloth
be
draw
,
and
the
lady
be
not
long
follow
it
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
the
gentleman
be
somewhat
more
sociable
but
not
much
so
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
of
course
talk
over
Eleanor
's
sin
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
indeed
so
far
betray
his
sister
-
in
-
law
as
to
whisper
into
Mr.
Arabin
's
ear
in
the
study
,
as
they
meet
there
before
dinner
,
a
hint
of
what
he
fear
.
<EOS>
He
do
so
with
the
grave
and
saddest
of
fear
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
become
grave
and
apparently
sad
enough
as
he
hear
it
.
<EOS>
He
open
his
eye
,
and
his
mouth
and
say
in
a
sort
of
whisper
"
Mr.
Slope
!
"
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
as
he
may
have
say
"
the
Cholera
!
"
have
his
friend
tell
him
that
that
horrid
disease
be
in
his
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
so
,
I
fear
so
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
and
then
together
they
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
not
accurately
analyse
Mr.
Arabin
's
feeling
on
receipt
of
such
astounding
tiding
.
<EOS>
It
will
suffice
to
say
that
he
be
surprised
,
vexed
,
sorrowful
,
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
perhaps
think
very
much
about
Eleanor
,
but
he
have
appreciate
her
influence
,
and
have
feel
that
close
intimacy
with
her
in
a
country
-
house
be
pleasant
to
him
,
and
also
beneficial
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
highly
of
her
intelligence
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
have
walk
about
the
shrubbery
with
her
,
carry
her
boy
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Arabin
have
call
Johnny
his
darling
,
Eleanor
be
not
angry
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
three
man
sit
over
their
wine
,
all
think
of
the
same
subject
,
but
unable
to
speak
of
it
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
so
we
will
leave
them
and
follow
the
lady
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
receive
a
commission
from
her
husband
,
and
have
undertake
it
with
some
unwillingness
.
<EOS>
He
have
desire
her
to
speak
gravely
to
Eleanor
and
to
tell
her
that
,
if
she
persist
in
her
adherence
to
Mr.
Slope
,
she
could
no
longer
look
for
the
countenance
of
her
present
friend
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
probably
know
her
sister
better
than
the
doctor
do
,
and
assure
him
that
it
would
be
in
vain
to
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
only
course
likely
to
be
of
any
service
in
her
opinion
be
to
keep
Eleanor
away
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
may
have
add
,
for
she
have
a
very
keen
eye
in
such
thing
,
that
there
may
also
be
grind
for
hope
in
keep
Eleanor
near
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
of
this
,
however
,
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
the
archdeacon
would
not
be
talk
over
;
he
speak
much
of
his
conscience
,
and
declare
that
,
if
Mrs.
Grantly
would
not
do
it
,
he
would
.
<EOS>
so
instigate
,
the
lady
undertake
the
task
,
state
,
however
,
her
full
conviction
that
her
interference
would
be
bad
than
useless
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
prove
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
Mrs.
Grantly
find
some
excuse
for
send
her
girl
away
,
and
then
begin
her
task
.
<EOS>
She
know
well
that
she
could
exercise
but
very
slight
authority
over
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Their
various
mode
of
life
,
and
the
distance
between
their
residence
,
have
prevent
any
very
close
confidence
.
<EOS>
They
have
hardly
live
together
since
Eleanor
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
,
moreover
,
especially
in
latter
year
,
resent
in
a
quiet
sort
of
way
the
dictatorial
authority
which
the
archdeacon
seem
to
exercise
over
her
father
,
and
on
this
account
have
be
unwilling
to
allow
the
archdeacon
's
wife
to
exercise
authority
over
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
a
note
just
before
dinner
,
I
believe
,
"
begin
the
eld
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
acknowledge
that
she
have
do
so
,
and
feel
that
she
turn
red
as
she
acknowledge
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
anything
to
have
keep
her
colour
,
but
the
more
she
try
to
do
so
the
more
signally
she
fail
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
from
Mr.
Slope
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
say
that
the
letter
be
from
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
a
regular
correspondent
of
yours
,
Eleanor
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
exactly
,
"
say
she
,
already
begin
to
feel
angry
at
the
cross
-
examination
.
<EOS>
She
determine
,
and
why
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
,
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
tell
her
sister
Susan
<EOS>
what
be
the
subject
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
she
know
,
be
instigate
by
the
archdeacon
,
and
she
would
not
plead
to
any
arraignment
make
against
her
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Eleanor
dear
,
why
do
you
get
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
at
all
,
know
,
<EOS>
as
you
do
,
he
be
a
person
so
distasteful
to
Papa
,
and
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
indeed
to
all
your
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
Susan
,
I
do
not
get
letter
from
him
;
and
in
the
next
place
,
as
Mr.
Slope
write
the
one
letter
which
I
have
get
,
and
as
I
only
receive
it
,
which
I
could
not
very
well
help
do
,
as
Papa
hand
it
to
me
,
I
think
you
have
better
ask
Mr.
Slope
instead
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
his
letter
about
,
Eleanor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
,
"
say
she
,
"
because
it
be
confidential
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
business
respect
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
no
way
personal
to
yourself
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
exactly
say
that
,
Susan
,
"
say
she
,
get
more
and
more
angry
at
her
sister
's
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
must
say
it
be
rather
singular
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
,
affect
to
laugh
,
"
that
a
young
lady
in
your
position
should
receive
a
letter
from
an
unmarried
gentleman
of
which
she
will
not
tell
the
content
and
which
she
be
ashamed
to
show
to
her
sister

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
ashamed
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
blaze
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
ashamed
of
anything
in
the
matter
;
only
I
do
not
choose
to
be
cros
-
examined
as
to
my
letter
by
anyone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
dear
,
"
say
the
other
,
"
I
can
not
but
tell
you
that
I
do
not
think
Mr.
Slope
a
proper
correspondent
for
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
ever
so
improper
,
how
can
I
help
his
have
write
to
me
?
<EOS>
but
you
be
all
prejudice
against
him
to
such
an
extent
that
that
which
would
be
kind
and
generous
in
another
man
be
odious
and
impudent
in
him
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
religion
that
teach
one
to
be
so
one
-
sided
in
one
's
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
Eleanor
,
that
you
hate
the
religion
you
find
here
,
but
surely
you
should
remember
that
in
such
matter
the
archdeacon
must
know
more
of
the
world
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
respect
or
comply
with
me
,
although
I
be
,
unfortunately
,
so
many
year
your
senior
;
but
surely
,
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
you
may
consent
to
be
guide
by
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
be
most
anxious
to
be
your
friend
,
if
you
will
let
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
such
a
matter
as
what
?
"
say
Eleanor
very
testily
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know
what
this
be
all
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
want
you
to
drop
Mr.
Slope

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
all
want
me
to
be
as
illiberal
as
yourself

that
I

never

<EOS>
I
see
no
harm
in
Mr.
Slope
's
acquaintance

I
shall
not
insult
the
man
by
tell
him
that
I
do

<EOS>
He
have
think
it
necessary
to
write
to

I
do
not
want
the
archdeacon
's
advice
about
the
letter

I
do

I
would
ask
it

then
,
Eleanor

it
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
,

now
she
speak
with
a
tremendous
gravity
,
"
that
the
archdeacon
think
that
such
a
correspondence
be
disgraceful
,

that
he
can
not
allow
it

go
on
in

house

"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
eye
flash
fire
as
she
answer
her
sister
,
jump
up
from
her
seat
as
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
tell
the
archdeacon
that
wherever
I
be
I
shall
receive
what
letter
I
please

from

as
for

disgraceful

if
Dr.

have
use
it

he
have
be
unmanly

inhospitable

walk
off
to
the
door

when
Papa
come
from
the
dining

room
I
will
thank
you
to
ask

step
up
to

I
will
show
him
Mr.

letter

I
will
show
it
to
no
one

<EOS>
and
so
say
,
she
retreat
to
her
baby
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
conception
of
the
crime
with
which
she
be
charge
.
<EOS>
the
idea
that
she
could
be
think
by
her
friend
to
regard
Mr.
Slope
as
a
lover
have
never
flash
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
conceive
that
they
be
all
prejudiced
and
illiberal
in
their
persecution
of
him
,
and
therefore
she
would
not
join
in
the
persecution
,
even
though
she
greatly
dislike
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
very
angry
as
she
seat
herself
in
a
low
chair
by
her
open
window
at
the
foot
of
her
child
's
bed
.
"
<EOS>
to
dare
to
say
I
have
disgrace
myself
,
"
she
repeat
to
herself
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
Papa
can
put
up
with
that
man
's
arrogance
!
<EOS>
I
will
certainly
not
sit
down
to
dinner
in
his
house
again
unless
he
beg
my
pardon
for
that
word
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
thought
strike
her
that
Mr.
Arabin
may
perchance
hear
of
her
"
disgraceful
"
correspondence
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
she
turn
crimson
with
pure
vexation
.
<EOS>
oh
,
if
she
have
know
the
truth
!
<EOS>
if
she
could
have
conceive
that
Mr.
Arabin
have
be
inform
as
a
fact
that
she
be
go
to
marry
Mr.
Slope

<EOS>
She
have
not
be
long
in
her
room
before
her
father
join
her

<EOS>
as
he
leave
the
drawing
-
room
Mrs.
Grantly
take
her
husband
into
the
recess
of
the
window
and
tell
him
how
signally
she
have
fail
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
her
myself
before
I
go
to
bed
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
no
such
thing
,
"
say
she
;
"
you
can
do
no
good
and
will
only
make
an
unseemly
quarrel
in
the
house

<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
how
headstrong
she
can
be

"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
declare
that
as
to
that
he
be
quite
indifferent
.
<EOS>
He
know
his
duty
and
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
weak
in
the
extreme
in
such
matter

<EOS>
He
would
not
have
it
hereafter
on
his
conscience
that
he
have
not
do
all
that
in
him
lay
to
prevent
so
disgraceful
an
alliance

<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Mrs.
Grantly
assure
him
that
speak
to
Eleanor
angrily
would
only
hasten
such
a
crisis
and
render
it
certain
,
if
at
present
there
be
any
doubt

<EOS>
He
be
angry
,
self
-
willed
,
and
sore
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
a
lady
of
his
household
have
receive
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
have
wound
his
pride
in
the
sore
place
,
and
nothing
could
control
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
look
worn
and
woe

begone
as
he
enter
his
daughter
's
room

<EOS>
these
sorrow
worry
him
sadly

<EOS>
He
feel
that
if
they
be
continue
,
he
must
go
to
the
wall
in
the
manner
so
kindly
prophesy
to
him
by
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
He
knock
gently
at
his
daughter
's
door
,
wait
till
he
be
distinctly
bade
to
enter
,
and
then
appear
as
though

not

the
suspect
criminal

<EOS>
Eleanor

arm
be
soon
within
his

and
she
have
soon
kiss
his
forehead

caress
him

with
eager
love

"

she

Mr.
Harding
confess
with
a
sort
of
murmur
that
the
archdeacon
have
be
speak
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hate
Dr.
grantly
soon
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
uncharitable
,
so
unkind
,
so
suspicious
of
everyone
that
do
not
worship
himself
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
be
so
monstrously
arrogant
to
other
people
who
have
a
right
to
their
opinion
as
well
as
he
have
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
an
earnest
,
eager
man
,
my
dear
,
but
he
never
mean
to
be
unkind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
unkind
,
Papa
,
most
unkind
.
<EOS>
there
,
I
get
that
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
yourself
who
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
there
,
pray
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
should
have
be
address
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
they
have
be
talk
about
it
downstairs
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
they
behave
to
me
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
and
since
dinner
Susan
have
be
preach
to
me
,
till
I
could
not
remain
in
the
room
with
her
.
<EOS>
read
it
,
Papa
,
and
then
say
whether
that
be
a
letter
that
need
make
Dr.
grantly
so
outrageous
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
take
his
arm
from
his
daughter
's
waist
and
slowly
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
expect
to
see
his
countenance
light
with
joy
as
he
learn
that
his
path
back
to
the
hospital
be
make
so
smooth
;
but
she
be
doom
to
disappointment
,
as
have
once
be
the
case
before
on
a
somewhat
similar
occasion
.
<EOS>
His
first
feeling
be
one
of
unmitigated
disgust
that
Mr.
Slope
should
have
choose
to
interfere
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
hospital
,
but
he
would
have
infinitely
sooner
resign
all
pretension
to
the
place
than
have
owe
it
in
any
manner
to
Mr.
Slope
's
influence
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
then
he
thoroughly
dislike
the
tone
of
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
;
it
be
unctuous
,
false
,
and
unwholesome
,
like
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
see
,
which
Eleanor
have
fail
to
see
,
that
much
more
have
be
intend
than
be
express
.
<EOS>
the
appeal
to
Eleanor
's
pious
labour
as
separate
from
his
own
grated
sadly
against
his
feeling
as
a
father
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
he
come
to
the
"
darling
boy
"
and
the
"
silken
tress
,
"
he
slowly
close
and
fold
the
letter
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
Mr.
Slope
should
so
write
unless
he
have
be
encourage
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
Eleanor
should
have
receive
such
a
letter
,
and
have
receive
it
without
annoyance
,
unless
she
be
willing
to
encourage
him
.
<EOS>
so
at
least
Mr.
Harding
argue
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
how
hard
it
be
to
judge
accurately
of
the
feeling
of
other
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
as
he
come
to
the
close
of
the
letter
,
in
his
heart
condemn
his
daughter
for
indelicacy
,
and
it
make
him
miserable
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
responsible
for
what
Mr.
Slope
may
write
.
<EOS>
true
.
<EOS>
but
then
she
express
no
disgust
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
rather
express
approval
of
the
letter
as
a
whole
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
it
to
him
to
read
,
as
a
vindication
for
herself
and
also
for
him
.
<EOS>
the
father
's
spirit
sink
within
him
as
he
feel
that
he
could
not
acquit
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
the
true
feminine
delicacy
of
Eleanor
's
mind
which
bring
on
her
this
condemnation
.
<EOS>
listen
to
me
,
lady
,
and
I
beseech
you
to
acquit
her
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
this
man
,
this
lover
of
whom
she
be
so
unconscious
,
exactly
as
her
father
do
,
exactly
as
the
Grantlys
do
.
<EOS>
at
least
she
esteem
him
personally
as
they
do
.
<EOS>
but
she
believe
him
to
be
in
the
main
an
honest
man
,
and
one
truly
inclined
to
assist
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
feel
herself
bind
,
after
what
have
pass
,
to
show
this
letter
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
necessary
that
he
should
know
what
Mr.
Slope
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
,
or
condemn
,
or
even
allude
to
the
vulgarity
of
the
man
's
tone
,
which
arise
,
as
do
all
vulgarity
,
from
ignorance
.
<EOS>
It
be
nauseous
to
her
to
have
a
man
like
Mr.
Slope
comment
on
her
personal
attraction
,
and
she
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
dilate
with
her
father
upon
what
be
nauseous
.
<EOS>
She
never
suppose
they
could
disagree
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
painful
for
her
to
point
it
out
,
painful
for
her
to
speak
strongly
against
a
man
of
whom
,
on
the
whole
,
she
be
anxious
to
think
and
speak
well
.
<EOS>
in
encounter
such
a
man
she
have
encounter
what
be
disagreeable
,
as
she
may
do
in
walk
the
street
.
<EOS>
but
in
such
encounter
she
never
think
it
necessary
to
dwell
on
what
disgust
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
,
foolish
,
weak
,
love
man
,
would
not
say
one
word
,
though
one
word
would
have
clear
up
everything
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
a
deluge
of
tear
,
and
in
ten
minute
everyone
in
the
house
would
have
understand
how
matter
really
be
.
<EOS>
the
father
would
have
be
delight
.
<EOS>
the
sister
would
have
kiss
her
sister
and
beg
a
thousand
pardon
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
would
have
apologize
and
wonder
,
and
raise
his
eyebrow
,
and
go
to
bed
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Arabin
 
Mr.
Arabin
would
have
dreamt
of
Eleanor
,
have
awake
in
the
morning
with
idea
of
love
,
and
retire
to
rest
the
next
evening
with
scheme
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
all
this
be
not
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
slowly
fold
the
letter
,
hand
it
back
to
her
,
kiss
her
forehead
,
and
bade
God
bless
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
creep
slowly
away
to
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
leave
the
passage
,
another
knock
be
give
at
Eleanor
's
door
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
be
very
demure
own
maid
,
enter
on
tiptoe
,
want
to
know
would
Mrs.
Bold
be
so
kind
as
to
speak
to
the
archdeacon
for
two
minute
in
the
archdeacon
's
study
,
if
not
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
compliment
,
and
he
would
not
detain
her
two
minute
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
think
it
be
very
disagreeable
;
she
be
tired
and
fagged
and
sick
at
heart
;
her
present
feeling
towards
Dr.
Grantly
be
anything
but
those
of
affection
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
no
coward
,
and
therefore
promise
to
be
in
the
study
in
five
minute
.
<EOS>
so
she
arrange
her
hair
,
tie
on
her
cap
,
and
go
down
with
a
palpitate
heart
.
   
<EOS>
a
serious
interview
 
<EOS>
there
be
people
who
delight
in
serious
interview
,
especially
when
to
them
appertain
the
part
of
offer
advice
or
administer
rebuke
,
and
perhaps
the
archdeacon
be
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
yet
on
this
occasion
he
do
not
prepare
himself
for
the
come
conversation
with
much
anticipation
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
his
fault
he
be
not
an
inhospitable
man
,
and
he
almost
feel
that
he
be
sin
against
hospitality
in
upbraid
Eleanor
in
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
then
,
also
,
he
be
not
quite
sure
that
he
would
get
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
wife
have
tell
him
that
he
decidedly
would
not
,
and
he
usually
give
credit
to
what
his
wife
say
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
so
convinced
of
what
he
consider
to
be
the
impropriety
of
Eleanor
's
conduct
,
and
so
assured
also
of
his
own
duty
in
try
to
check
it
,
that
his
conscience
would
not
allow
him
to
take
his
wife
's
advice
and
go
to
bed
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
face
as
she
enter
the
room
be
not
such
as
to
reassure
him
.
<EOS>
as
a
rule
she
be
always
mild
in
manner
and
gentle
in
conduct
;
but
there
be
that
in
her
eye
which
make
it
not
an
easy
task
to
scold
her
.
<EOS>
in
truth
she
have
be
little
use
to
scold
.
<EOS>
no
one
since
her
childhood
have
try
it
but
the
archdeacon
,
and
he
have
generally
fail
when
he
do
try
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
do
so
since
her
marriage
;
and
now
,
when
he
see
her
quiet
,
easy
step
as
she
enter
his
room
,
he
almost
wish
that
he
have
take
his
wife
's
advice
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
by
apologize
for
the
trouble
he
be
give
her
.
<EOS>
She
beg
him
not
to
mention
it
,
assure
him
that
walk
downstairs
be
no
trouble
to
her
at
all
,
and
then
take
a
seat
and
wait
patiently
for
him
to
begin
his
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eleanor
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
hope
you
believe
me
when
I
assure
you
that
you
have
no
sincerer
friend
than
I
be
.
"
<EOS>
to
this
Eleanor
answer
nothing
,
and
therefore
he
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
a
brother
of
your
own
,
I
should
not
probably
trouble
you
with
what
I
be
go
to
say
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
I
can
not
but
think
that
it
must
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
know
that
you
have
near
you
one
who
be
as
anxious
for
your
welfare
as
any
brother
of
your
own
could
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
a
brother
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never
have
,
and
it
be
therefore
that
I
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
a
brother
,
"
she
repeat
,
"
but
I
have
hardly
feel
the
want
.
<EOS>
Papa
have
be
to
me
both
father
and
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
be
the
fond
and
most
affectionate
of
man
.
<EOS>
but
 
"
  
"
He
be
 
the
fond
and
most
affectionate
of
man
,
and
the
good
of
counsellor
.
<EOS>
while
he
live
I
can
never
want
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
rather
put
the
archdeacon
out
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
exactly
contradict
what
his
sister
-
in
-
law
say
about
her
father
,
and
yet
he
do
not
at
all
agree
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
want
her
to
understand
that
he
tender
his
assistance
because
her
father
be
a
soft
,
good
-
natured
gentleman
not
sufficiently
know
in
the
way
of
the
world
;
but
he
could
not
say
this
to
her
.
<EOS>
so
he
have
to
rush
into
the
subject
-
matter
of
his
proffer
counsel
without
any
acknowledgement
on
her
part
that
she
could
need
it
,
or
would
be
grateful
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
tell
me
that
you
receive
a
letter
this
evening
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
Papa
bring
it
in
the
brougham
.
<EOS>
do
he
not
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Susan
say
that
you
object
to
let
her
know
what
it
be
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
she
ask
me
.
<EOS>
but
have
she
do
so
,
I
should
not
have
tell
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
nice
to
be
ask
about
one
's
letter
.
<EOS>
if
one
wish
to
show
them
,
one
do
so
without
be
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
.
<EOS>
quite
so
.
<EOS>
what
you
say
be
quite
true
.
<EOS>
but
be
not
the
fact
of
your
receive
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
,
which
you
do
not
wish
to
show
to
your
friend
,
a
circumstance
which
must
excite
some
 
some
surprise
 
<EOS>
some
suspicion
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
suspicion
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
not
speak
above
her
usual
voice
,
speak
still
in
a
soft
,
womanly
tone
but
yet
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
suspicion
!
<EOS>
and
who
suspect
me
,
and
of
what
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
pause
,
for
the
archdeacon
<EOS>
be
not
quite
ready
to
explain
the
ground
of
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
I
do
not
choose
to
show
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
to
Susan
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
show
it
to
anyone
till
Papa
have
see
it
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
wish
to
read
it
now
,
you
can
do
so
,
"
and
she
hand
the
letter
to
him
over
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
an
amount
of
compliance
which
he
have
not
at
all
expect
,
and
which
rather
upset
him
in
his
tactic
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
take
the
letter
,
peruse
it
carefully
,
and
then
refolde
it
,
keep
it
on
the
table
under
his
hand
.
<EOS>
to
him
it
appear
to
be
in
almost
every
respect
the
letter
of
a
declared
lover
;
it
seem
to
corroborate
his
bad
suspicion
;
and
the
fact
of
Eleanor
's
show
it
to
him
be
all
but
tantamount
to
a
declaration
on
her
part
that
it
be
her
pleasure
to
receive
love
-
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
almost
entirely
overlook
the
real
subject
-
matter
of
the
epistle
,
so
intent
be
he
on
the
forthcoming
courtship
and
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
thank
you
to
give
it
me
back
,
if
you
please
,
Dr.
Grantly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
it
in
his
hand
and
hold
it
up
,
but
make
no
immediate
overture
to
return
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Harding
have
see
this
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
have
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
be
write
that
he
may
see
it
.
<EOS>
It
refer
solely
to
his
business
 
of
course
I
show
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
Eleanor
,
do
you
think
that
that
be
a
proper
letter
for
you
 
for
a
person
in
your
condition
 
to
receive
from
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
a
proper
letter
,
"
say
she
,
speak
,
perhaps
,
a
little
out
of
obstinacy
,
probably
forget
at
the
moment
the
objectionable
mention
of
her
silken
curl
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Eleanor
,
it
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
I
wholly
differ
from
you

I
suppose

sheer
opposition

determination

succumb

You
think
Mr.
Slope
be
a
messenger
direct
from
Satan

<EOS>
I
think
he
be
an
industrious
,
well
-
mean
clergyman

<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
we
differ
as
we
do

,
as
we
do
differ
,
we
have
probably
well
not
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Eleanor
undoubtedly
put
herself
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
may
probably
have
refuse
to
talk
to
Dr.
Grantly
on
the
matter
in
dispute
without
any
impropriety
,
but
,
have
consent
to
listen
to
him
,
she
have
no
business
to
tell
him
that
he
regard
Mr.
Slope
as
an
emissary
from
the
evil
one
;
nor
be
she
justify
in
praise
Mr.
Slope
,
see
that
in
her
heart
of
heart
she
do
not
think
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
wound
in
spirit
,
and
angry
,
and
bitter
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
subject
to
contumely
and
cross
-
questioning
and
ill
-
usage
through
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
no
one
,
not
even
Mr.
Arabin
,
not
even
her
father
,
have
be
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
all
this
she
attribute
to
the
prejudice
and
conceit
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
therefore
she
resolve
to
set
no
bound
to
her
antagonism
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
neither
give
nor
take
quarter
.
<EOS>
He
have
greatly
presume
in
dare
to
question
her
about
her
correspondence
,
and
she
be
determine
to
show
that
she
think
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
you
be
forget
yourself

say
he
,
look
very
sternly
at
her

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
otherwise
you

never
tell
me

I
conceive
any
man

<EOS>

you
do

she

nothing

bad

give
me
that
letter

and
she
stretch
out
her
hand
and
take
it
from
him

<EOS>
He
have
be
do
his
good
to
serve
Papa
,
do
more
than
any
of
Papa

friend
could
do
;
and
yet
,
because
he
be
the
chaplain
of
a
bishop
whom
you
do
not
like

you
speak
of
him
as

usage

He

I
believe
that
he

do
a
great
deal

as

I

grateful

then
pause
for

Dr.

as

do
his
good

gracious
to

He
have
endeavour
not
to
be
harsh
to
her

have
strive
to
pluck
the
ste
from
his
rebuke

he
do
not
intend
that
she
should
leave
him
without
hear
him

<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
say
,
Eleanor
,
and
I
fear
I
must
trouble
you
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
You
profess
that
it
be
quite
proper
that
you
should
receive
from
Mr.
Slope
such
letter
as
that
you
have
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
Susan
and
I
think
very
differently

<EOS>
You
be
,
of
course
,
your
own
mistress
,
and
much
as
we
both
must
grieve
should
anything
separate
you
from
us
,
we
have
no
power
to
prevent
you
from
take
step
which
may
lead
to
such
a
separation

<EOS>
if
you
be
so
wilful
as
to
reject
the
counsel
of
your
friend

you
must
be
allow
to
cater
for
yourself

<EOS>
but
,
Eleanor
,
I
may
at
any
rate
ask
you
this
.
<EOS>
be
it
worth
your
while
to
break
away
from
all
those
you

love
 
from
all

I
must
speak
out
to

You
must
choose
between

Mr.

I

<EOS>
Mr.

altogether
beneath

You

ask

agree
with

it
be
quite
impossible

should
be

at
Plumstead

Mrs.
Slope

"
  
<EOS>
not
be
favourite
with
the
tragic
muse
,
we
do
not
dare
to
attempt
any
description
of
Eleanor
's
face
when
she
first
hear
the
name
of
Mrs.
Slope
pronounce
as
that
which
would
or
should
or
may
at
some
time
appertain
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
look
,
such
as
it
be
,
Dr.
Grantly
do
not
soon
forget
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
or
two
she
could
find
no
word
to
express
her
deep
anger
and
deep
disgust
;
indeed
,
at
this
conjuncture
,
word
do
not
come
to
her
very
freely
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
be
so
impertinent
?
<EOS>
"
at
last
she
say
,
and
then
she
hurry
out
of
the
room
without
give
the
archdeacon
the
opportunity
of
utter
another
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
difficulty
she
contain
herself
till
she
reach
her
own
room
;
and
then
,
lock
the
door
,
she
throw
herself
on
her
bed
and
sob
as
though
her
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
but
even
yet
she
have
no
conception
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
idea
that
her
father
and
her
sister
have
for
day
past
conceive
in
sober
earnest
the
idea
that
she
be
go
to
marry
this
man
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
then
believe
that
the
archdeacon
think
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
by
some
manoeuvre
of
her
brain
she
attribute
the
origin
of
the
accusation
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
as
she
do
so
her
anger
against
him
be
excessive
,
and
the
vexation
of
her
spirit
almost
unendurable
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
think
that
the
charge
be
make
seriously
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
her
most
probable
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Arabin
have
talk
over
her
objectionable
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
;
that
Mr.
Arabin
in
his
jeering
,
sarcastic
way
have
suggest
the
odious
match
as
be
the
severe
way
of
treat
with
contumely
her
acquaintance
with
his
enemy
;
and
that
the
archdeacon
,
take
the
idea
from
him
,
think
proper
to
punish
her
by
the
allusion
.
<EOS>
the
whole
night
she
lie
awake
thinking
of
what
have
be
say
,
and
this
appear
to
be
the
most
probable
solution
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
reflexion
that
Mr.
Arabin
should
have
in
any
way
mention
her
name
in
connexion
with
that
of
Mr.
Slope
be
overpower
;
and
the
spiteful
ill
-
nature
of
the
archdeacon
in
repeat
the
charge
to
her
make
her
wish
to
leave
his
house
almost
before
the
day
have
break
.
<EOS>
one
thing
be
certain
:
nothing
should
make
her
stay
there
beyond
the
follow
morning
,
and
nothing
should
make
her
sit
down
to
breakfast
in
company
with
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
when
she
think
of
the
man
whose
name
have
be
link
with
her
own
,
she
cry
from
sheer
disgust
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
because
she
would
be
thus
disgust
,
thus
pain
and
shock
and
cut
to
the
quick
,
that
the
archdeacon
have
speak
the
horrid
word
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
make
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
therefore
he
have
outrage
her
by
his
abominable
vulgarity
.
<EOS>
She
determine
that
at
any
rate
he
should
know
that
she
appreciate
it
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
the
archdeacon
a
bit
better
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
serious
interview
than
be
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
He
gather
from
it
,
as
indeed
he
could
hardly
fail
to
do
,
that
she
be
very
angry
with
him
,
but
he
think
that
she
be
thus
angry
,
not
because
she
be
suspect
of
an
intention
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
,
but
because
such
an
intention
be
impute
to
her
as
a
crime
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
regard
this
suppose
union
with
disgust
,
but
it
never
occur
to
him
that
Eleanor
be
outrage
because
she
look
at
it
exactly
in
the
same
light
.
  
<EOS>
He
return
to
his
wife
,
vexed
and
somewhat
disconsolate
,
but
nevertheless
confirm
in
his
wrath
against
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
"
<EOS>
Her
whole
behaviour
,
"
say
he
,
"
have
be
most
objectionable
.
<EOS>
She
hand
me
his
love
-
letter
to
read
as
though
she
be
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
proud
of
have
this
slavering
,
greedy
man
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
She
will
throw
herself
and
John
Bold
's
money
into
his
lap
;
she
will
ruin
her
boy
,
disgrace
her
father
and
you
,
and
be
a
wretched
miserable
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
spouse
,
who
be
sit
at
her
toilet
-
table
,
continue
her
avocation
,
make
no
answer
to
all
this
.
<EOS>
She
have
know
that
the
archdeacon
would
gain
nothing
by
interfere
,
but
she
be
too
charitable
to
provoke
him
by
say
so
while
he
be
in
such
deep
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
come
of
a
man
make
such
a
will
as
that
of
Bold
's
,
"
he
continue
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
be
no
more
fitted
to
be
trust
with
such
an
amount
of
money
in
her
own
hand
than
be
a
charity
-
school
girl
.
"
still
Mrs.
grantly
make
no
reply
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
do
my
duty
;
I
can
do
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
her
plainly
that
she
can
not
be
allow
to
form
a
link
of
connexion
between
me
and
that
man
.
<EOS>
from
henceforward
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
make
her
welcome
at
plumstead
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
have
Mr.
Slope
's
love
-
letter
come
here
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
I
think
you
have
better
let
her
understand
that
,
as
her
mind
on
this
subject
seem
to
be
irrevocably
fix
,
it
will
be
well
for
all
party
that
she
should
return
to
Barchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
Mrs.
Grantly
be
angry
with
Eleanor
 
nearly
as
angry
as
her
husband
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
idea
of
turn
her
sister
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
at
length
speak
out
and
explain
to
the
archdeacon
in
her
own
mild
,
seducing
way
that
he
be
fume
and
fussing
and
fret
himself
very
unnecessarily
.
<EOS>
She
declare
that
thing
,
if
leave
alone
,
would
arrange
themselves
much
better
than
he
could
arrange
them
,
and
at
last
succeed
in
induce
him
to
go
to
bed
in
a
somewhat
less
inhospitable
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
Eleanor
's
maid
be
commission
to
send
word
into
the
dining
-
room
that
her
mistress
be
not
well
enough
to
attend
prayer
and
that
she
would
breakfast
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
here
she
be
visit
by
her
father
,
and
declare
to
him
her
intention
of
return
immediately
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
be
hardly
surprise
by
the
announcement
.
<EOS>
all
the
household
seem
to
be
aware
that
something
have
go
wrong
.
<EOS>
everyone
walk
about
with
subdued
foot
,
and
people
's
shoe
seem
to
creak
more
than
usual
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
look
of
conscious
intelligence
on
the
face
of
the
woman
,
and
the
man
attempt
,
but
in
vain
,
to
converse
as
though
nothing
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
all
this
have
weigh
heavily
on
the
heart
of
Mr.
Harding
,
and
when
Eleanor
tell
him
that
her
immediate
return
to
Barchester
be
a
necessity
,
he
merely
sigh
piteously
and
say
that
he
would
be
ready
to
accompany
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
she
object
strenuously
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
wish
,
she
say
,
to
go
alone
;
a
great
desire
that
it
may
be
see
that
her
father
be
not
implicate
in
her
quarrel
with
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
to
this
at
last
he
give
way
;
but
not
a
word
pass
between
them
about
Mr.
Slope
 
not
a
word
be
say
,
not
a
question
ask
as
to
the
serious
interview
on
the
precede
evening
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
very
little
confidence
between
them
,
though
neither
of
them
know
why
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
once
ask
him
whether
he
would
not
call
upon
the
bishop
,
but
he
answer
rather
tartly
that
he
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
think
he
should
,
but
he
could
not
say
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
part
.
<EOS>
each
be
miserably
anxious
for
some
show
of
affection
,
for
some
return
of
confidence
,
for
some
sign
of
the
feeling
that
usually
bind
them
together
.
<EOS>
but
none
be
give
.
<EOS>
the
father
could
not
bring
himself
to
question
his
daughter
about
her
suppose
lover
,
and
the
daughter
would
not
sully
her
mouth
by
repeat
the
odious
word
with
which
Dr.
Grantly
have
rouse
her
wrath
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
trouble
in
arrange
the
method
of
Eleanor
's
return
.
<EOS>
She
beg
her
father
to
send
for
a
post
-
chaise
,
but
when
Mrs.
Grantly
hear
of
this
,
she
object
strongly
.
<EOS>
if
Eleanor
would
go
away
in
dudgeon
with
the
archdeacon
,
why
should
she
let
all
the
servant
and
all
the
neighbourhood
know
that
she
have
do
so
?
<EOS>
so
at
last
Eleanor
consent
to
make
use
of
the
Plumstead
carriage
,
and
as
the
archdeacon
have
go
out
immediately
after
breakfast
and
be
not
to
return
till
dinner
-
time
,
she
also
consent
to
postpone
her
journey
till
after
lunch
,
and
to
join
the
family
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
not
a
word
be
say
by
anyone
.
<EOS>
the
affair
of
the
carriage
be
arrange
by
Mr.
Harding
,
who
act
as
Mercury
between
the
two
lady
;
they
,
when
they
meet
,
kiss
each
other
very
lovingly
and
then
sit
down
each
to
her
crochet
work
as
though
nothing
be
amiss
in
all
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
another
love
scene
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
visitor
at
the
rectory
whose
feeling
in
this
unfortunate
matter
must
be
somewhat
strictly
analyse
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
have
hear
from
his
friend
of
the
probability
of
Eleanor
's
marriage
with
Mr.
Slope
with
amazement
,
but
not
with
incredulity
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
he
be
not
in
love
with
Eleanor
,
and
up
to
this
period
this
certainly
have
be
true
.
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
he
hear
that
she
love
someone
else
,
he
begin
to
be
very
fond
of
her
himself
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
make
up
his
mind
that
he
wish
to
have
her
for
his
wife
;
he
have
never
think
of
her
,
and
do
not
now
think
of
her
,
in
connexion
with
himself
;
but
he
experience
an
inward
,
indefinable
feeling
of
deep
regret
,
a
gnawing
sorrow
,
an
unconquerable
depression
of
spirit
,
and
also
a
species
of
self
-
abasement
that
he
 
he
,
Mr.
Arabin
 
have
not
do
something
to
prevent
that
other
he
,
that
vile
he
whom
he
so
thoroughly
despise
,
from
carry
off
this
sweet
prize
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
man
may
have
reach
the
age
of
forty
unmarried
without
know
something
of
such
feeling
must
have
be
very
successful
or
else
very
cold
-
hearted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
have
never
think
of
trim
the
sail
of
his
bark
so
that
he
may
sail
as
convoy
to
this
rich
argosy
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
beautiful
,
but
he
have
not
dreamt
of
make
her
beauty
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
rich
,
but
he
have
have
no
more
idea
of
appropriate
her
wealth
than
that
of
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
have
discover
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
intelligent
,
warm
-
hearted
,
agreeable
,
sensible
,
all
in
fact
that
a
man
could
wish
his
wife
to
be
;
but
the
high
be
her
attraction
,
the
great
her
claim
to
consideration
,
<EOS>
the
less
have
he
imagine
that
he
may
possibly
become
the
possessor
of
them
.
<EOS>
such
have
be
his
instinct
rather
than
his
thought
,
so
humble
and
so
diffident
.
<EOS>
now
his
diffidence
be
to
be
reward
by
his
see
this
woman
,
whose
beauty
be
to
his
eye
perfect
,
whose
wealth
be
such
as
to
have
deter
him
from
think
of
her
,
whose
widowhood
would
have
silence
him
have
he
not
be
so
deter
,
by
his
see
her
become
the
prey
of
 
Obadiah
Slope
!
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
departure
he
get
on
his
horse
to
ride
over
to
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
as
he
ride
he
keep
mutter
to
himself
a
line
from
Van
Artevelde
,
  
<EOS>
how
little
flattering
be
woman
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
strove
to
recall
his
mind
and
to
think
of
other
affair
 
his
parish
,
his
college
,
his
creed
 
but
his
thought
<EOS>
would
revert
to
Mr.
Slope
and
the
flemish
chieftain
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
think
upon
it
,
how
little
flattering
be
woman
's
love
,
give
commonly
to
whosoe'er
<EOS>
be
near
and
prop
with
most
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
Mrs.
Bold
should
marry
anyone
but
him
 
he
have
not
put
himself
forward
as
a
suitor
 
but
that
she
should
marry
Mr.
Slope
;
and
so
he
repeat
over
again
    
<EOS>
Outward
grace
<EOS>
nor
inward
light
be
needful
 
day
by
day
<EOS>
man
want
both
be
mate
with
the
good
and
lofty
of
God
's
feminine
creation
,
whose
love
take
no
distinction
but
of
gender
,
and
ridicule
the
very
name
of
choice
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
on
,
troubled
much
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
but
an
uneasy
ride
of
it
that
morning
,
and
little
good
<EOS>
do
he
do
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
  
<EOS>
the
necessary
alteration
in
his
house
be
be
fast
complete
,
and
he
walk
through
the
room
,
and
go
up
and
down
the
stair
,
and
ramble
through
the
garden
,
but
he
could
not
wake
himself
to
much
interest
about
them
.
<EOS>
He
stand
still
at
every
window
to
look
out
and
think
upon
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
at
almost
every
window
he
have
before
stand
and
chat
with
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mrs.
Grantly
have
be
there
continually
;
and
while
Mrs.
Grantly
have
be
give
order
,
and
see
that
order
have
be
comply
with
,
he
and
Eleanor
have
converse
on
all
thing
appertain
to
a
clergyman
's
profession
.
<EOS>
He
think
how
often
he
have
lay
down
the
law
to
her
and
how
sweetly
she
have
bear
with
his
somewhat
dictatorial
decree
.
<EOS>
He
remember
her
listen
intelligence
,
her
gentle
but
quick
reply
,
her
interest
in
all
that
concern
the
church
,
in
all
that
concern
him
;
and
then
he
strike
his
riding
-
whip
against
the
window
-
sill
and
declare
to
himself
that
it
be
impossible
that
Eleanor
Bold
should
marry
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
he
do
not
really
believe
,
as
he
should
have
do
,
that
it
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
know
her
well
enough
to
feel
that
it
be
truly
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
be
aware
that
Eleanor
have
that
within
her
which
would
surely
protect
her
from
such
degradation
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
like
so
many
other
,
be
deficient
in
confidence
in
woman
.
<EOS>
He
say
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
it
be
impossible
that
Eleanor
Bold
should
become
Mrs.
Slope
,
and
yet
he
believe
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
ramble
about
,
and
could
do
and
think
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
uncomfortable
,
thoroughly
ill
at
ease
,
cross
with
himself
and
everybody
else
,
and
feed
in
his
heart
on
animosity
towards
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
as
it
should
be
,
as
he
know
and
feel
,
but
he
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
in
truth
Mr.
Arabin
be
now
in
love
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
though
ignorant
of
the
fact
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
love
and
,
though
forty
year
old
,
be
in
love
without
be
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
fume
and
fret
and
do
not
know
what
be
the
matter
,
as
a
youth
may
do
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
and
so
have
do
no
good
at
St.
Ewold
's
,
he
ride
back
much
earlier
than
be
usual
with
him
,
instigate
by
some
inward
,
unacknowledged
hope
that
he
may
see
Mrs.
Bold
before
she
leave
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
not
pass
a
pleasant
morning
.
<EOS>
She
be
irritated
with
everyone
,
and
not
least
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
be
hardly
use
,
but
she
feel
also
that
she
have
not
play
her
own
card
well
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
hold
herself
so
far
above
suspicion
as
to
have
receive
her
sister
's
innuendo
and
the
archdeacon
's
lecture
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
do
this
,
but
have
show
herself
angry
and
sore
,
and
be
now
ashamed
of
her
own
petulance
,
yet
unable
to
discontinue
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
morning
she
have
spend
alone
,
<EOS>
but
after
awhile
her
father
join
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
fully
make
up
his
mind
that
,
come
what
come
might
,
nothing
should
separate
him
from
his
young
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
hard
task
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
of
see
her
at
the
head
of
Mr.
Slope
's
table
,
but
he
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
as
he
argue
to
himself
,
be
a
respectable
man
and
a
clergyman
,
and
he
,
as
Eleanor
's
father
,
have
no
right
even
to
endeavour
to
prevent
her
from
marry
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
tell
her
how
he
have
determine
to
prefer
her
to
all
the
world
,
how
he
be
prepared
to
admit
that
she
be
not
wrong
,
how
thoroughly
he
differ
from
Dr.
grantly
;
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
mention
Mr.
Slope
's
name
.
<EOS>
there
be
yet
a
chance
that
they
be
all
wrong
in
their
surmise
,
and
be
thus
in
doubt
,
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
openly
to
her
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
sit
with
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
say
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
some
little
soft
word
of
affection
and
work
hard
with
his
imaginary
fiddle
-
bow
,
when
Mr.
Arabin
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
get
up
,
and
the
two
make
some
trite
remark
to
each
other
,
neither
thinking
of
what
he
be
say
,
while
Eleanor
keep
her
seat
on
the
sofa
,
mute
and
moody
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
include
in
the
list
of
those
against
whom
her
anger
be
excited
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
have
dare
to
talk
about
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
;
he
,
too
,
have
dare
to
blame
her
for
not
make
an
enemy
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
intend
to
see
him
before
her
departure
,
and
be
now
but
little
inclined
to
be
gracious
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
feeling
through
the
whole
house
that
something
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
when
he
see
Eleanor
,
could
not
succeed
in
look
or
in
speak
as
though
he
know
nothing
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
cheerful
and
positive
and
contradictory
with
her
,
as
be
his
will
not
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
two
minute
in
the
room
before
he
feel
that
he
have
do
wrong
to
return
;
and
the
moment
he
hear
her
voice
,
he
thoroughly
wish
himself
back
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
,
should
he
have
wish
to
have
aught
further
to
say
to
the
future
wife
of
Mr.
Slope
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
hear
that
you
be
to
leave
us
so
soon
,
"
say
he
,
strive
in
vain
to
use
his
ordinary
voice
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
she
mutter
something
about
the
necessity
of
her
be
in
Barchester
,
and
betook
herself
most
industriously
to
her
crochet
work
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
more
trite
conversation
between
Mr.
Arabin
and
Mr.
Harding
 
trite
,
and
hard
,
and
vapid
,
and
senseless
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
have
anything
to
say
to
the
other
,
and
yet
neither
at
such
a
moment
like
to
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
at
last
Mr.
Harding
,
take
advantage
of
a
pause
,
escape
out
of
the
room
,
and
Eleanor
and
Mr.
Arabin
be
leave
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
going
will
be
a
great
break
-
up
to
our
party
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
She
again
mutter
something
which
be
all
but
inaudible
,
but
keep
her
eye
fix
upon
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
have
a
very
pleasant
month
here
,
"
say
he
;
"
at
least
I
have
;
and
I
be
sorry
it
should
be
so
soon
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
be
from
home
longer
than
I
intend
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
it
be
time
that
I
should
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
pleasant
hour
and
pleasant
day
must
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
so
few
of
them
be
pleasant
;
or
perhaps
,
rather
 
"
  
"
It
be
a
pity
,
certainly
,
that
man
and
woman
do
so
much
to
destroy
the
pleasantness
of
their
day
,
"
say
she
,
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
that
there
should
be
so
little
charity
abroad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
charity
should
begin
at
home
,
"
say
he
,
and
he
be
proceed
to
explain
that
he
as
a
clergyman
could
not
be
what
she
would
call
charitable
at
the
expense
of
those
principle
<EOS>
which
he
consider
it
his
duty
to
teach
,
when
he
remember
that
it
would
be
bad
than
vain
to
argue
on
such
a
matter
with
the
future
wife
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
just
leave
us
,
"
he
continue
,
"
and
I
will
not
weary
your
last
hour
with
another
lecture
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
fear
I
have
give
you
too
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
practise
as
well
as
preach
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
I
should
.
<EOS>
so
should
we
all
.
<EOS>
all
of
us
who
presume
to
teach
be
bind
to
do
our
utmost
towards
fulfil
our
own
lesson
.
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
allow
my
deficiency
in
do
so
,
but
I
do
not
quite
know
now
to
what
you
allude
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
special
reason
for
tell
me
now
that
I
should
practise
as
well
as
preach
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
let
him
know
the
cause
of
her
anger
,
to
upbraid
him
for
speak
of
her
disrespectfully
,
and
then
at
last
to
forgive
him
,
and
so
part
friend
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
would
be
unhappy
to
leave
him
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
,
but
yet
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
speak
to
him
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>

that

knelt

everything

forgive

such
latitude

cherish

can
make
much
of
an
unmarried
man
without
commit
herself

her
feeling

She
have
be
do
this

have
be
do
it
<EOS>
he
have
regard
her
as
the
affiance
wife

another
man

<EOS>
as
she
pass
along
the
avenue
,
every
now

then
an
unbidden
tear
would
force
itself
on
her
cheek

and
as
she
raise
her
hand
to
brush
it
away
,
she
stamp
with
her
little
foot
upon
the
sward
with
very
spite

so
treat

Mr.

very
near
to
her

him

turn
short
round

her
step
down
the
avenue

try
to
rid
her
cheek
of
all
trace
of
the
tell

tale
tear

<EOS>
It
be
a
needless
endeavour

for
Mr.

be
in
a
state
of
mind
that
hardly
allow
him
to
observe
such
trifle

follow

reach
the
end

it

He
have
not
consider
how
he
would
address
her
;
he
have
not
think
what
he
would
say

<EOS>
He
have
only
feel
that
it
be
wretchedness
to
him
to
quarrel
with
her
,
and
that
it
would
be
happiness
to
be
allow
to
love
her
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
not
lower
himself
by
ask
her
pardon

<EOS>
He
have
do
her
no
wrong

<EOS>
He
have
not
calumniate
her
,
not
injure
her

as
she
have
accuse
him
of
do

<EOS>
He
could
not
confess
sin
of
which
he
have
not
be
guilty

He
could
only
let
the
past
be
past

ask
her
as

his
hope
for
the
future

no
enmity
on
my
part
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
I
endeavour
to
avoid
all
enmity
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
hollow
pretence
be
I
to
say
that
there
can
be
true
friendship
between
us
,
after
what
have
just
pass
.
<EOS>
People
can
not
make
their
friend
of
those
whom
they
despise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
I
despised
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
be
so
before
you
could
have
speak
of
me
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
deceive
,
cruelly
deceive
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
you
think
well
of
me
;
I
believe
that
you
esteem
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
think
well
of
you
and
esteem
you
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
justify
myself
before
you
,
I
must
use
strong
word
than
those
.
"
<EOS>
He
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
Eleanor
's
heart
beat
with
painful
violence
within
her
bosom
as
she
wait
for
him
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
esteem
,
do
esteem
you
,
as
I
never
yet
esteem
any
woman
.
<EOS>
think
well
of
you
!
<EOS>
I
never
think
to
think
so
well
,
so
much
of
any
human
creature
.
<EOS>
speak
calumny
of
you
!
<EOS>
insult
you
!
<EOS>
wilfully
injure
you
!
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
my
privilege
to
shield
you
from
calumny
,
insult
,
and
injury
.
<EOS>
Calumny
!
<EOS>
ah
me
!
"
<EOS>
twere
almost
better
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
well
than
to
worship
with
a
sinful
worship
;
sinful
and
vain
also
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
walk
along
beside
her
,
with
his
hand
clasp
behind
his
back
,
look
down
on
the
grass
beneath
his
foot
and
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
express
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
and
Eleanor
walk
beside
him
determine
at
least
to
give
him
no
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
utter
at
last
,
speak
rather
to
himself
than
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
ah
me
!
<EOS>
these
Plumstead
walk
be
pleasant
enough
,
if
one
could
have
but
heart
's
ease
,
but
without
that
the
dull
,
dead
stone
of
Oxford
be
far
preferable
 
and
St.
Ewold
's
,
too
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
be
begin
to
think
that
I
mistake
myself
when
I
come
hither
.
<EOS>
a
romish
priest
now
would
have
escape
all
this
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Father
of
heaven
,
how
good
for
us
would
it
be
if
thou
could
vouchsafe
to
us
a
certain
rule
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
we
not
a
certain
rule
,
Mr.
Arabin
?
"
  
"
yes
 
yes
,
surely
;
"
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
.
"
<EOS>
but
what
be
temptation
?
<EOS>
what
be
evil
?
<EOS>
be
this
evil
 
<EOS>
be
this
temptation
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Arabin
!
<EOS>
It
would
not
come
out
of
him
,
that
deep
,
true
love
of
his
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
utter
it
in
plain
language
that
would
require
and
demand
an
answer
.
<EOS>
He
know
not
how
to
say
to
the
woman
by
his
side
,
"
since
the
fact
be
that
you
do
not
love
that
other
man
,
that
you
be
not
to
be
his
wife
,
can
you
love
me
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
word
which
be
in
his
heart
,
but
with
all
his
sigh
he
could
not
draw
them
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
give
anything
,
everything
for
power
to
ask
this
simple
question
,
but
glib
as
be
his
tongue
in
pulpit
and
on
platform
,
now
he
could
not
find
a
word
wherewith
to
express
the
plain
wish
of
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
Eleanor
understand
him
as
thoroughly
as
though
he
have
declare
his
passion
with
all
the
elegant
fluency
of
a
practised
Lothario
.
<EOS>
with
a
woman
's
instinct
,
she
follow
every
bend
of
his
mind
as
he
speak
of
the
pleasantness
of
plumstead
and
the
stone
of
Oxford
,
as
he
allude
to
the
safety
of
the
romish
priest
and
the
hidden
peril
of
temptation
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
it
all
mean
love
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
this
man
at
her
side
,
this
accomplished
scholar
,
this
practise
orator
,
this
great
polemical
combatant
,
be
strive
and
strive
in
vain
to
tell
her
that
his
heart
be
no
longer
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
this
,
and
feel
a
sort
of
joy
in
know
it
;
yet
she
would
not
come
to
his
aid
.
<EOS>
He
have
offend
her
deeply
,
have
treat
her
unworthily
,
the
more
unworthily
see
that
he
have
learn
to
love
her
,
and
Eleanor
could
not
bring
herself
to
abandon
her
revenge
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
ask
herself
whether
or
no
she
would
ultimately
accept
his
love
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
now
perceive
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
it
do
not
touch
her
heart
;
it
merely
appease
her
pride
and
flatter
her
vanity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
have
dare
to
associate
her
name
with
that
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
now
her
spirit
be
soothe
by
find
that
he
would
fain
associate
it
with
his
own
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
walk
on
beside
him
,
inhale
incense
but
give
out
no
sweetness
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
answer
me
this
,
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
,
stop
suddenly
in
his
walk
and
step
forward
so
that
he
face
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
answer
me
this
one
question
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
love
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
intend
to
be
his
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
certainly
do
not
go
the
right
way
to
win
such
a
woman
as
Eleanor
Bold
.
<EOS>
just
as
her
wrath
be
evaporate
,
as
it
be
disappear
before
the
true
warmth
of
his
untold
love
,
he
rekindle
it
by
a
most
useless
repetition
of
his
original
sin
.
<EOS>
have
he
know
what
he
be
about
,
he
should
never
have
mention
Mr.
Slope
's
name
before
Eleanor
Bold
,
till
he
have
make
her
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
he
may
have
talk
of
Mr.
Slope
with
as
much
triumph
as
he
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
answer
no
such
question
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
what
be
more
,
I
must
tell
you
that
nothing
can
justify
your
ask
it
.
<EOS>
good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
she
step
proudly
across
the
lawn
and
,
pass
through
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
join
her
father
and
sister
at
lunch
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
afterwards
she
be
in
the
carriage
,
and
so
she
leave
Plumstead
without
again
see
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
His
walk
be
long
and
sad
among
the
sombre
tree
that
overshadow
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
He
leave
the
archdeacon
's
ground
that
he
may
escape
attention
,
and
saunter
among
the
green
hillock
under
which
lie
at
rest
<EOS>
so
many
of
the
once
love
swain
and
forgotten
beauty
of
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
to
his
ear
Eleanor
's
last
word
sound
like
a
knell
never
to
be
reverse
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
comprehend
that
she
may
be
angry
with
him
,
indignant
with
him
,
remorseless
with
him
,
and
yet
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
no
Mr.
Slope
be
in
truth
a
favour
rival
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
why
should
she
not
have
answer
his
question
?
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Arabin
 
untaught
,
illiterate
,
boorish
,
ignorant
man
!
<EOS>
that
at
forty
year
of
age
you
should
know
so
little
of
the
working
of
a
woman
's
heart
!
   
<EOS>
the
Bishop
's
library
 
<EOS>
and
thus
the
pleasant
party
at
Plumstead
be
break
up
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
very
pleasant
party
as
long
as
they
have
all
remain
in
good
humour
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
feel
her
house
to
be
gayer
and
bright
than
it
have
be
for
many
a
long
day
,
and
the
archdeacon
have
be
aware
that
the
month
have
pass
pleasantly
without
attribute
the
pleasure
to
any
other
special
merit
than
those
of
his
own
hospitality
.
<EOS>
within
three
or
four
day
of
Eleanor
's
departure
,
Mr.
Harding
have
also
return
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
have
go
to
Oxford
to
spend
one
week
there
previous
to
his
settling
at
the
vicarage
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
laden
with
many
message
to
Dr.
Gwynne
touch
the
iniquity
of
the
doing
in
Barchester
palace
and
the
peril
in
which
it
be
believe
the
hospital
still
stand
in
spite
of
the
assurance
contain
in
Mr.
Slope
's
inauspicious
letter
.
  
<EOS>
during
Eleanor
's
drive
into
Barchester
<EOS>
she
have
not
much
opportunity
of
reflect
on
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
constrain
to
divert
her
mind
both
from
his
sin
and
his
love
by
the
necessity
of
converse
with
her
sister
and
maintain
the
appearance
of
part
with
her
on
good
term
.
<EOS>
when
the
carriage
reach
her
own
door
,
and
while
she
be
in
the
act
of
give
her
last
kiss
to
her
sister
and
niece
,
Mary
Bold
run
out
and
exclaim
:
  
"
oh
,
Eleanor
,
have
you
hear
?
<EOS>
oh
,
Mrs.
Grantly
,
have
you
hear
what
have
happen
?
<EOS>
the
poor
dean
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
what
 
what
have
happen
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
this
morning
at
nine
he
have
a
fit
of
apoplexy
,
and
he
have
not
speak
since
.
<EOS>
I
very
much
fear
that
by
this
time
he
be
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
be
very
intimate
with
the
dean
,
and
be
therefore
much
shocked
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
not
know
him
so
well
;
nevertheless
,
she
be
sufficiently
acquaint
with
his
person
and
manner
to
feel
startled
and
grieve
also
at
the
tiding
she
now
receive
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
at
once
to
the
deanery
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
;
"
the
archdeacon
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
news
to
send
you
,
I
will
let
Thomas
call
before
he
leave
town
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
the
carriage
drive
off
,
leave
Eleanor
and
her
baby
with
Mary
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
into
Barchester
that
morning
by
himself
,
not
care
to
intrude
himself
upon
Eleanor
,
and
he
also
immediately
on
his
arrival
have
hear
of
the
dean
's
fit
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
as
we
have
before
say
,
a
library
or
reading
-
room
connect
the
cathedral
with
the
dean
's
house
.
<EOS>
this
be
generally
call
the
bishop
's
library
,
because
a
certain
bishop
of
Barchester
be
suppose
to
have
add
it
to
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
It
be
build
immediately
over
a
portion
of
the
cloister
,
and
a
flight
of
stair
descend
from
it
into
the
room
in
which
the
cathedral
clergyman
put
their
surplice
on
and
off
.
<EOS>
as
it
also
open
directly
into
the
dean
's
house
,
it
be
the
passage
through
which
that
dignitary
usually
go
to
his
public
devotion
.
<EOS>
who
have
or
have
not
the
right
of
entry
into
it
,
it
may
be
difficult
to
say
;
but
the
people
of
Barchester
believe
that
it
belong
to
the
dean
,
and
the
clergyman
of
Barchester
believe
that
it
belong
to
the
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
in
question
most
of
the
resident
clergyman
who
constitute
the
chapter
,
and
some
few
other
,
be
here
assemble
,
and
among
them
as
usual
the
archdeacon
tower
with
high
authority
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
of
the
dean
's
fit
before
he
be
over
the
bridge
which
lead
into
the
town
,
and
have
at
once
come
to
the
well
-
know
clerical
trysting
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
there
by
eleven
o'clock
,
and
have
remain
ever
since
.
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
the
medical
man
who
have
be
call
in
come
through
from
the
deanery
into
the
library
,
uttered
little
bulletin
,
and
then
return
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
it
appear
,
very
little
hope
of
the
old
man
's
rallying
,
indeed
<EOS>
no
hope
of
anything
like
a
final
recovery
.
<EOS>
the
only
question
be
whether
he
must
die
at
once
speechless
,
unconscious
,
stricken
to
death
by
his
first
heavy
fit
,
or
whether
by
due
aid
of
medical
skill
he
may
not
be
so
far
bring
back
to
this
world
as
to
become
conscious
of
his
state
and
enable
to
address
one
prayer
to
his
Maker
before
he
be
call
to
meet
Him
face
to
face
at
the
judgement
seat
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
Pie
have
be
send
for
from
London
.
<EOS>
that
great
man
have
show
himself
a
wonderful
adept
at
keep
life
still
move
within
an
old
man
's
heart
in
the
case
of
good
old
Bishop
Grantly
,
and
it
may
be
reasonably
expect
that
he
would
be
equally
successful
with
a
dean
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Dr.
Fillgrave
and
Mr.
Rerechild
be
do
their
good
,
and
poor
Miss
Trefoil
sit
at
the
head
of
her
father
's
bed
,
longing
,
as
in
such
case
daughter
do
long
,
to
be
allow
to
do
something
to
show
her
love
 
if
it
be
only
to
chafe
his
foot
with
her
hand
,
or
wait
in
menial
office
on
those
autocratic
doctor
 
anything
so
that
now
in
the
time
of
need
she
may
be
of
use
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
alone
of
the
attendant
clergy
have
be
admit
for
a
moment
into
the
sick
man
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
have
creep
in
with
creaking
shoe
,
have
say
with
smothered
voice
a
word
of
consolation
to
the
sorrow
daughter
,
have
look
on
the
distorted
face
of
his
old
friend
with
solemn
but
yet
eager
scrutinising
eye
,
as
though
he
say
in
his
heart
"
and
so
some
day
it
will
probably
be
with
me
,
"
and
then
,
have
whisper
an
unmeaning
word
or
two
to
the
doctor
,
have
creak
his
way
back
again
into
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
never
speak
again
,
I
fear
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
as
he
noiselessly
close
the
door
,
as
though
the
unconscious
die
man
,
from
whom
all
sense
have
flee
,
would
have
hear
in
his
distant
chamber
the
spring
of
the
lock
which
be
now
so
carefully
handle
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
!

indeed

over
in
his
own
mind
all
the
probable
candidate
for
the
deanery

wonder
whether
the
archdeacon
would
think
it
worth
his
while
to
accept
it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fit
must
have
be

<EOS>
the

almost
turn
pale
at
the
idea

<EOS>
what
if
Mr.

should
become
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
to
be
sure
there
be
no
adequate
ground

indeed
no
ground
at
all
,
for
presume
that
such
a
desecration
could
even
be
contemplate

nevertheless
it
be
on
the
card

Dr.

interest
with

as

how
should
they
all
conduct
themselves
if
Mr.

the
bare
idea

strike
even

probable

I
should
think
such
an
appointment
highly
improbable

extremely
injudicious

out

at

consciousness

whether
this
be
due
to
Sir
Omicron
Pie
be
a
question
on
which
it
may
be
well
not

Dr.

be
very
clear

at

express
an
opinion

some

eight

ten
next
day
,
accordingly
,
the
poor
dean
remain
in
the
same
state
,
half
-
conscious
and
half
-
comatose
;
and
the
attendant
clergy
begin
to
think
that
no
new
appointment
would
be
necessary
for
some
few
month
to
come
.
   
<EOS>
a
New
Candidate
for
Ecclesiastical
Honours
 
<EOS>
the
dean
's
illness
occasion
much
mental
turmoil
in
other
place
besides
the
deanery
and
adjoining
library
,
and
the
idea
which
occur
to
the
meagre
little
prebendary
about
Mr.
Slope
do
not
occur
to
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
sit
listlessly
in
his
study
when
the
news
reach
him
of
the
dean
's
illness
.
<EOS>
It
be
bring
to
him
by
Mr.
Slope
,
who
of
course
be
not
the
last
person
in
Barchester
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
not
slow
in
find
its
way
to
Mrs.
Proudie
's
ear
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
presume
that
there
be
not
just
then
much
friendly
intercourse
between
these
two
rival
claimant
for
his
lordship
's
obedience
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
though
live
in
the
same
house
,
they
have
not
meet
since
the
stormy
interview
between
them
in
the
bishop
's
study
on
the
precede
day
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
occasion
Mrs.
Proudie
have
be
defeat
.
<EOS>
that
the
prestige
of
continual
victory
should
have
be
tear
from
her
standard
<EOS>
be
a
subject
of
great
sorrow
to
that
militant
lady
;
but
,
though
defeat
,
she
be
not
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
may
yet
recover
her
lose
ground
,
that
she
may
yet
hurl
Mr.
Slope
down
to
the
dust
from
which
she
have
pick
him
,
and
force
her
sin
lord
to
sue
for
pardon
in
sackcloth
and
ashe
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
memorable
day
,
memorable
for
his
mutiny
and
rebellion
against
her
high
behest
,
he
have
carry
his
way
with
a
high
hand
,
and
have
really
begin
to
think
it
possible
that
the
day
of
his
slavery
be
count
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
hope
that
he
be
now
about
to
enter
into
a
free
land
,
a
land
delicious
with
milk
which
he
himself
may
quaff
and
honey
which
would
not
tantalize
him
by
be
only
honey
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Proudie
bang
the
door
as
she
leave
his
room
,
he
feel
himself
every
inch
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
his
spirit
have
be
a
little
cow
by
his
chaplain
's
subsequent
lecture
,
but
on
the
whole
he
be
highly
pleased
with
himself
,
and
he
flatter
himself
that
the
bad
be
over
.
"
<EOS>
_
Ce
n'est
que
le
premier
pas
qui
coûte
_
,
"
he
reflect
,
and
now
that
the
first
step
have
be
so
magnanimously
take
,
all
the
rest
would
follow
easily
.
  
<EOS>
He
meet
his
wife
as
a
matter
of
course
at
dinner
,
where
little
or
nothing
be
say
that
could
ruffle
the
bishop
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
and
the
servant
be
present
and
protect
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
one
or
two
trifling
remark
on
the
subject
of
his
project
visit
to
the
archbishop
,
in
order
to
show
to
all
concern
that
he
intend
to
have
his
own
way
;
the
very
servant
,
perceive
the
change
,
transfer
a
little
of
their
reverence
from
their
mistress
to
their
master
.
<EOS>
all
which
the
master
perceive
,
and
so
also
do
the
mistress
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Proudie
bide
her
time
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
he
return
to
his
study
,
where
Mr.
Slope
soon
find
him
,
and
there
they
have
tea
together
and
plan
many
thing
.
<EOS>
for
some
few
minute
the
bishop
be
really
happy
;
but
as
the
clock
on
the
chimney
-
piece
warn
him
that
the
stilly
hour
of
night
be
draw
on
,
as
he
look
at
his
chamber
candlestick
and
know
that
he
must
use
it
,
his
heart
sink
within
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
a
ghost
,
all
whose
power
of
wander
free
through
these
upper
region
cease
at
cock
-
crow
;
or
,
rather
,
he
be
the
opposite
of
the
ghost
,
for
till
cock
-
crow
he
must
again
be
a
serf
.
<EOS>
and
would
that
be
all
?
<EOS>
Could
he
trust
himself
to
come
down
to
breakfast
a
free
man
in
the
morning
?
  
<EOS>
He
be
nearly
an
hour
later
than
usual
when
he
betake
himself
to
his
rest
.
<EOS>
rest
!
<EOS>
what
rest
?
<EOS>
however
,
he
take
a
couple
of
glass
of
sherry
and
mount
the
stair
.
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
us
to
follow
him
thither
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
thing
which
no
novelist
,
no
historian
,
should
attempt
;
some
few
scene
in
life
's
drama
which
even
no
poet
should
dare
to
paint
.
<EOS>
let
that
which
pass
between
Dr.
Proudie
and
his
wife
on
this
night
be
understand
to
be
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
down
the
following
morning
a
sad
and
thoughtful
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
attenuate
in
appearance
 
one
may
almost
say
emaciated
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
his
now
grizzle
lock
have
not
palpably
become
more
grey
than
on
the
precede
evening
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
have
age
materially
.
<EOS>
year
do
not
make
a
man
old
gradually
and
at
an
even
pace
.
<EOS>
look
through
the
world
and
see
if
this
be
not
so
always
,
except
in
those
rare
case
in
which
the
human
being
life
and
die
without
joy
and
without
sorrow
,
like
a
vegetable
.
<EOS>
a
man
shall
be
possess
of
florid
,
youthful
blooming
health
till
<EOS>
,
it
matter
not
what
age
 
<EOS>
thirty
;
forty
;
<EOS>
fifty
 
then
come
some
nipping
frost
,
some
period
of
agony
,
that
rob
the
fibre
of
the
body
of
their
succulence
,
and
the
hale
and
hearty
man
be
count
among
the
old
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
down
and
breakfast
alone
;
Mrs.
Proudie
,
be
indispose
,
take
her
coffee
in
her
bedroom
,
and
her
daughter
wait
upon
her
there
.
<EOS>
He
eat
his
breakfast
alone
,
and
then
,
hardly
know
what
he
do
,
he
betake
himself
to
his
usual
seat
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
solace
himself
with
his
come
visit
to
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
that
effort
of
his
own
free
will
at
any
rate
remain
to
him
as
an
endure
triumph
.
<EOS>
but
somehow
,
now
that
he
have
achieve
it
,
he
do
not
seem
to
care
so
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
ambition
that
have
prompt
him
to
take
his
place
at
the
archiepiscopal
table
,
and
his
ambition
be
now
quite
dead
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
thus
seat
when
Mr.
Slope
make
his
appearance
,
with
breathless
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
My

exclaim
the

startle
out
of
his
apathy
by
an
announcement
so
sad
and
so
sudden
.

He

He

I

tell
that
there

indeed

I
do
not
doubt
that
by

<EOS>
bell

ring

and
servant
be
immediately
send
to
inquire

<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
bishop
,
lean
on
his
chaplain
's
arm
,
himself
call
at
the
deanery
door
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
send
to
Miss
Trefoil
all
manner
of
offer
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
the
Misses
Proudie
send
also
,
and
there
be
immense
sympathy
between
the
palace
and
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
the
answer
to
all
inquiry
be
unvaried
.
<EOS>
the
dean
be
just
the
same
,
and
Sir
Omicron
Pie
be
expect
down
by
the
9.15
P.M.
train
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Slope
begin
to
meditate
,
as
other
also
have
do
,
as
to
who
may
possibly
be
the
new
dean
,
and
it
occur
to
him
,
as
it
have
also
occur
to
other
,
that
it
may
be
possible
that
he
should
be
the
new
dean
himself
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
question
as
to
the
twelve
hundred
,
or
fifteen
hundred
,
or
two
thousand
run
in
his
mind
,
as
it
have
run
through
those
of
the
other
clergyman
in
the
cathedral
library
.
  
<EOS>
whether
it
may
be
two
thousand
,
or
fifteen
,
or
twelve
hundred
,
it
would
in
any
case
undoubtedly
be
a
great
thing
for
him
,
if
he
could
get
it
.
<EOS>
the
gratification
to
his
ambition
would
be
great
even
than
that
of
his
covetousness
.
<EOS>
how
glorious
to
out
-
top
the
archdeacon
in
his
own
cathedral
city
;
to
sit
above
prebendary
and
canon
and
have
the
cathedral
pulpit
and
all
the
cathedral
service
altogether
at
his
own
disposal
!
  
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
easy
to
wish
for
this
than
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
be
not
without
some
mean
of
forward
his
view
,
and
he
at
any
rate
do
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
foot
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
think
 
and
not
vainly
 
that
he
could
count
upon
what
assistance
the
bishop
could
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
change
his
view
with
regard
to
his
patron
;
he
make
up
his
mind
that
if
he
become
dean
,
he
would
hand
his
lordship
back
again
to
his
wife
's
vassalage
;
and
he
think
it
possible
that
his
lordship
may
not
be
sorry
to
rid
himself
of
one
of
his
mentor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
also
take
some
step
towards
make
his
name
know
to
other
man
in
power
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
chief
-
commissioner
of
national
school
,
who
at
the
present
moment
be
presume
to
stand
especially
high
in
the
good
grace
of
the
government
bigwig
,
and
with
him
Mr.
Slope
have
contrive
to
establish
a
sort
of
epistolary
intimacy
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
may
safely
apply
to
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
,
and
he
feel
sure
that
if
Sir
Nicholas
choose
to
exert
himself
,
the
promise
of
such
a
piece
of
preferment
would
be
have
for
the
asking
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
also
have
the
press
at
his
bidding
,
or
flatter
himself
that
he
have
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Daily
Jupiter
"
have
take
his
part
in
a
very
thorough
manner
in
those
polemical
contest
of
his
with
Mr.
Arabin
;
he
have
on
more
than
one
occasion
absolutely
have
an
interview
with
a
gentleman
on
the
staff
of
that
paper
who
,
if
not
the
editor
,
be
as
good
as
the
editor
;
and
he
have
long
be
in
the
habit
of
write
tell
letter
on
all
manner
of
ecclesiastical
abuse
,
which
he
sign
with
his
initial
,
and
send
to
his
editorial
friend
with
private
note
sign
in
his
own
name
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
and
Mr.
Towers
 
such
be
the
name
of
the
powerful
gentleman
of
the
press
with
whom
he
be
connect
 
be
generally
very
amiable
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
little
production
be
always
print
and
occasionally
comment
upon
;
and
thus
,
in
a
small
sort
of
way
,
he
have
become
a
literary
celebrity
.
<EOS>
this
public
life
have
great
charm
for
him
,
though
it
certainly
also
have
its
drawback
.
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
when
speak
in
the
presence
of
reporter
,
he
have
fail
to
uphold
and
praise
and
swear
by
that
special
line
of
conduct
which
have
be
uphold
and
praise
and
swear
by
in
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
and
then
he
have
be
much
surprised
and
at
the
moment
not
a
little
irritated
to
find
himself
lacerate
most
unmercifully
by
his
old
ally
.
<EOS>
He
be
quiz
and
bespatter
and
make
a
fool
of
,
just
as
though
,
or
rather
bad
than
if
,
he
have
be
a
constant
enemy
instead
of
a
constant
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
hitherto
not
learn
that
a
man
who
aspire
to
be
on
the
staff
of
"
the
Jupiter
"
must
surrender
all
individuality
.
<EOS>
but
ultimately
this
little
castigation
have
break
no
bone
between
him
and
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
one
of
those
who
understand
the
world
too
well
to
show
himself
angry
with
such
a
potentate
as
"
the
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
kiss
the
rod
that
scourge
him
,
and
now
think
that
he
may
fairly
look
for
his
reward
.
<EOS>
He
determine
that
he
would
at
once
let
Mr.
Towers
know
that
he
be
a
candidate
for
the
place
which
be
about
to
become
vacant
.
<EOS>
More
than
one
piece
of
preferment
have
lately
be
give
away
much
in
accordance
with
advice
tender
to
the
government
in
the
column
of
"
the
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
incumbent
on
Mr.
Slope
first
to
secure
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
specially
feel
that
it
behove
him
to
do
this
before
the
visit
to
the
archbishop
be
make
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
quite
providential
that
the
dean
should
have
fall
ill
just
at
the
very
nick
of
time
.
<EOS>
if
Dr.
Proudie
could
be
instigate
to
take
the
matter
up
warmly
,
he
may
manage
a
good
deal
while
stay
at
the
archbishop
's
palace
.
<EOS>
feel
this
very
strongly
,
Mr.
Slope
determine
to
sound
the
bishop
that
very
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
start
on
the
following
morning
to
London
,
and
therefore
not
a
moment
could
be
lose
with
safety
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
bishop
's
study
about
five
o'clock
and
find
him
still
sit
alone
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
suppose
that
he
have
hardly
move
since
the
little
excitement
occasion
by
his
walk
to
the
dean
's
door
.
<EOS>
He
still
wear
on
his
face
that
dull
,
dead
look
of
half
-
unconscious
suffering
.
<EOS>
He
be
do
nothing
,
read
nothing
,
think
of
nothing
,
but
simply
gaze
on
vacancy
when
Mr.
Slope
for
the
second
time
that
day
enter
his
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Slope
,
"
say
he
somewhat
impatiently
,
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
be
not
anxious
just
at
present
to
have
much
conversation
with
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
will
be
sorry
to
hear
that
as
yet
the
poor

show
no
sign
of

ah

no

not

I
wonder
they
do
not

rich

the
truth

all

do
no

no

to
show

no

indeed

strong

if

how
to
frame
his
little

sufficiently
modest

<EOS>
the

for
awhile
dumbfound

<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Dean
of
Barchester
!
<EOS>
the
idea
of
such
a
transformation
of
character
would
never
have
occur
to
his
own
unaided
intellect
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
go
on
think
why
,
for
what
reason
,
on
what
account
,
Mr.
Slope
should
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
but
by
degree
the
direction
of
his
thought
change
,
and
he
begin
to
think
why
,
for
what
reason
,
on
what
account
,
Mr.
Slope
should
not
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
he
himself
,
the
bishop
,
be
concern
,
he
could
well
spare
the
service
of
his
chaplain
.
<EOS>
that
little
idea
of
use
Mr.
Slope
as
a
counterpoise
to
his
wife
have
well
nigh
evaporate
.
<EOS>
He
have
all
but
acknowledge
the
futility
of
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
if
indeed
he
could
have
sleep
in
his
chaplain
's
bedroom
instead
of
his
wife
's
,
there
may
have
be
something
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
 
.
<EOS>
and
thus
as
Mr.
Slope
be
speak
,
the
bishop
begin
to
recognize
the
idea
that
that
gentleman
may
become
Dean
of
Barchester
without
impropriety
 
not
move
,
indeed
,
by
Mr.
Slope
's
eloquence
,
for
he
do
not
follow
the
tenor
of
his
speech
,
but
lead
thereto
by
his
own
cogitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
say
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slope
,
"
that
it
would
be
my
chief
desire
to
act
in
all
matter
connect
with
the
cathedral
as
far
as
possible
in
accordance
with
your
view
.
<EOS>
I
know
your
lordship
so
well
<EOS>
(
and
I
hope
you
know
me
<EOS>
well
enough
to
have
the
same
feeling
)
<EOS>
that
I
be
satisfied
that
my
being
in
that
position
would
add
materially
to
your
own
comfort
,
and
enable
you
to
extend
the
sphere
of
your
useful
influence
.
<EOS>
as
I
say
before
,
it
be
most
desirable
that
there
should
be
but
one
opinion
among
the
dignitary
of
the
same
diocese
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
much
whether
I
would
accept
such
an
appointment
in
any
diocese
in
which
I
should
be
constrain
to
differ
much
from
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
there
would
be
a
delightful
uniformity
of
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
perfectly
well
perceive
that
the
bishop
do
not
follow
a
word
that
he
say
,
but
nevertheless
he
go
on
talk
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
be
necessary
that
Dr.
Proudie
should
recover
from
his
surprise
,
and
he
know
also
that
he
must
give
him
the
opportunity
of
appear
to
have
be
persuade
by
argument
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
and
produce
a
multitude
of
fitting
reason
all
tend
to
show
that
no
one
on
earth
could
make
so
good
a
Dean
of
Barchester
as
himself
,
that
the
government
and
the
public
would
assuredly
coincide
in
desire
that
he
,
Mr.
Slope
,
should
be
Dean
of
Barchester
,
but
that
for
high
consideration
of
ecclesiastical
polity
it
would
be
especially
desirable
that
this
piece
of
preferment
should
be
so
bestow
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
really
do
not
know
what
I
could
do
in
the
matter
,
"
say
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
would
mention
it
to
the
archbishop
;
if
you
could
tell
his
grace
that
you
consider
such
an
appointment
very
desirable
,
that
you
have
it
much
at
heart
with
a
view
to
put
an
end
to
schism
in
the
diocese
;
if
you
do
this
with
your
usual
energy
,
you
would
probably
find
no
difficulty
in
induce
his
grace
to
promise
that
he
would
mention
it
to
Lord
 
---
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
would
let
the
archbishop
know
that
I
be
not
look
for
the
preferment
solely
through
his
intervention
;
that
you
do
not
exactly
require
him
to
ask
it
as
a
favour
;
that
you
expect
that
I
shall
get
it
through
other
source
,
as
be
indeed
the
case
;
but
that
you
be
very
anxious
that
his
grace
should
express
his
approval
of
such
an
arrangement
to
Lord
 
---
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
end
in
the
bishop
promise
to
do
as
he
be
bid
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
so
promise
without
a
stipulation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
about
that
hospital
,
"
he
say
in
the
middle
of
the
conference
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
never
so
troubled
in
my
life
"
 
which
be
about
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
speak
to
Mr.
Harding
since
I
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
assure
his
patron
that
he
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
well
,
then
 
I
think
upon
the
whole
it
will
be
well
to
let
Quiverful
have
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
half
-
promise
to
him
,
and
he
have
a
large
family
and
be
very
poor
.
<EOS>
I
think
on
the
whole
it
will
be
well
to
make
out
the
nomination
for
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
still
think
that
he
be
bind
to
make
a
fight
for
his
own
view
on
this
matter
,
and
remember
that
it
still
behove
him
to
maintain
his
lately
acquire
supremacy
over
Mrs.
Proudie
,
lest
he
should
fail
in
his
view
regard
the
deanery
,
"
but
,
my
lord
,
I
be
really
much
afraid
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
remember
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
"
I
can
hold
out
no
sort
of
hope
to
you
in
this
matter
of
succeed
poor
Dr.
Trefoil
.
<EOS>
I
will
certainly
speak
to
the
archbishop
,
as
you
wish
it
,
but
I
can
not
think
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
fully
understand
the
bishop
and
in
his
turn
interrupt
him
,
"
perhaps
your
lordship
be
right
about
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
I
can
easily
arrange
matter
with
Mr.
Harding
,
and
I
will
make
out
the
nomination
for
your
signature
as
you
direct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Slope
,
I
think
that
will
be
good
;
and
you
may
be
sure
that
any
little
that
I
can
do
to
forward
your
view
shall
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
now
much
business
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
make
his
daily
visit
to
the
signora
.
<EOS>
this
common
prudence
should
have
now
induce
him
to
omit
,
but
he
be
infatuate
,
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
be
commonly
prudent
.
<EOS>
He
determine
therefore
that
he
would
drink
tea
at
the
Stanhopes
"
,
and
he
determine
also
,
or
think
that
he
determine
,
that
have
do
so
he
would
go
thith
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
to
arrange
his
matter
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
opinion
that
Eleanor
would
grace
the
deanery
as
perfectly
as
she
would
the
chaplain
's
cottage
,
and
he
think
,
moreover
,
that
Eleanor
's
fortune
would
excellently
repair
any
dilapidation
and
curtailment
in
the
dean
's
stipend
which
may
have
be
make
by
that
ruthless
ecclesiastical
commission
.
  
<EOS>
Touching
Mrs.
Bold
his
hope
now
soar
high
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
one
of
that
numerous
multitude
of
swain
who
think
that
all
be
fair
in
love
,
and
he
have
accordingly
not
refrain
from
use
the
service
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
own
maid
.
<EOS>
from
her
he
have
learn
much
of
what
have
take
place
at
plumstead
 
not
exactly
with
truth
,
for
"
<EOS>
the
own
maid
"
have
not
be
able
to
divine
the
exact
truth
,
but
with
some
sort
of
similitude
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mrs.
Grantly
and
Mr.
Harding
and
Mr.
Arabin
have
all
quarrel
with
"
missus
"
for
have
receive
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
;
that
"
missus
"
have
positively
refuse
to
give
the
letter
up
;
that
she
have
receive
from
the
archdeacon
the
option
of
give
up
either
Mr.
Slope
and
his
letter
,
or
else
the
society
of
Plumstead
Rectory
;
and
that
"
missus
"
have
declare
,
with
much
indignation
,
that
"
she
do
not
care
a
straw
for
the
society
of
Plumstead
Rectory
,
"
and
that
she
would
not
give
up
Mr.
Slope
for
any
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
consider
the
source
from
whence
this
come
,
it
be
not
quite
so
untrue
as
may
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
It
show
pretty
plainly
what
have
be
the
nature
of
the
conversation
in
the
servant
"
hall
;
and
,
couple
as
it
be
with
the
certainty
of
Eleanor
's
sudden
return
,
it
appear
to
Mr.
Slope
to
be
so
far
worthy
of
credit
as
to
justify
him
in
think
that
the
fair
widow
would
in
all
human
probability
accept
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
work
be
therefore
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
desirable
,
he
think
,
that
he
should
make
his
offer
before
it
be
know
that
Mr.
Quiverful
be
finally
appoint
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
in
his
letter
to
Eleanor
he
have
plainly
declare
that
Mr.
Harding
be
to
have
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain
this
away
,
and
be
he
to
write
another
letter
to
Eleanor
,
tell
the
truth
and
throw
the
blame
on
the
bishop
,
it
would
naturally
injure
him
in
her
estimation
.
<EOS>
He
determine
therefore
to
let
that
matter
disclose
itself
as
it
would
,
and
to
lose
no
time
in
throw
himself
at
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
have
to
solicit
the
assistance
of
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
and
Mr.
Towers
,
and
he
go
directly
from
the
bishop
's
presence
to
compose
his
letter
to
those
gentleman
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Slope
be
esteem
an
adept
at
letter
writing
,
they
shall
be
give
in
full

my

SIR
NICHOLAS

<EOS>
I
hope
that
the
intercourse
which
have
be
between
us
will
preclude
you
from
regard
my
present
application
as
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
I
imagine
,
have
yet
hear
that
poor
old
Dr.
Trefoil
have
be
seize
with
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subject
of
profound
grief
to
everyone
in
Barchester
,
for
he
have
always
be
an
excellent
man
 
excellent
as
a

and
as
a

.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
full
of

and
his
life
could
not
under
any
circumstance
have
be
much
longer
spare

<EOS>
You
may

have
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be

it

no
probable
chance
of
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
Pie
be
,
I
believe
,
at

with
him
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
the
medical
man
here
have
declare
that
one
or
two
day
more
must
limit
the
tether
of
his
mortal
coil
.
<EOS>
I
sincerely
trust
that
his
soul
may
wing
its
flight
to
that
haven
where
it
may
forever
be
at
rest
and
forever
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
the

have
be
speak
to
me
about
the
preferment
,
and
he
be
anxious
that
it
should
be
confer
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
can
hardly
venture
,
at
my
age
,
to
look
for
such
advancement
,
but
I
be
so
far
encourage
by
his
lordship
that
I
believe
I
shall
be
induce
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
His

go
to

morrow

be
intent
on
mention
the

I

<EOS>
in

you

<EOS>
now
that
the

have
be
put

I
be
of

anxious
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
assist
me
by
your
good

,
you
will
confer
on
me
one
additional

<EOS>
I
have
better
add
,
that
Lord

can
not

have
fall

,
or
rather
of
its

of
fall
(
for
poor

<EOS>
Dr.

.
<EOS>
Should
Lord

first
hear
it
from
you

that
may
probably
be
think
to
give
you
a

<EOS>
of

our

be
that

<EOS>
this
be
most

it

You

OBADIAH
SLOPE
  
<EOS>
His
letter
to
Mr.
Towers
be
write
in
quite
a
different
strain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
conceive
that
he
completely
understand
the
difference
in
character
and
position
of
the
two
man
whom
he
address
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
for
such
a
man
as
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
a
little
flummery
be
necessary
,
and
that
it
may
be
of
the
easy
,
everyday
description
.
<EOS>
accordingly
his
letter
to
Sir
Nicholas
be
write
,
_
currente
calamo
_
,
with
very
little
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Towers
it
be
not
so
easy
to
write
a
letter
that
should
be
effective
and
yet
not
offensive
,
that
should
carry
its
point
without
undue
interference
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
to
flatter
Dr.
Proudie
or
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
,
but
very
difficult
to
flatter
Mr.
Towers
without
let
the
flattery
declare
itself
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
have
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
this
letter
must
,
in
appearance
at
least
,
be
write
without
effort
,
and
be
fluent
,
unconstrained
,
and
demonstrative
of
no
doubt
or
fear
on
the
part
of
the
writer
.
<EOS>
therefore
the
epistle
to
Mr.
Towers
be
study
,
and
re
-
copy
,
and
elaborate
at
the
cost
of
so
many
minute
that
Mr.
Slope
have
hardly
time
to
dress
himself
and
reach
Dr.
Stanhope

<EOS>
my
dear
SIR

<EOS>
We
be
all
a
good
deal
shock
here
this
morning
by
hear
that
poor
old
Dean
Trefoil
have
be
stricken
with
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
the
fit
take
him
about
9
A.M.
I
be
write
now
to
save
the
post
,
and
he
be
still
alive
,
but
past
all
hope
or
possibility
,
I
believe
,
of
living
.
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
Pie
be
here
,
or
will
be
very
shortly
,
but
all
that
even
Sir
Omicron
can
do
be
to
ratify
the
sentence
of
his
less
distinguished
brother
that
nothing
can
be
do
.
<EOS>
poor
Dr.
Trefoil
's
race
on
this
side
the
grave
be
run
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
you
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
,
quiet
,
charitable
man
,
of
the
old
school
,
of
course
,
as
any
clergyman
over
seventy
year
of
age
must
necessarily
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
write
merely
with
the
object
of
send
you
such
news
as
this
:
<EOS>
doubtless
someone
of
your
mercury
will
have
see
and
hear
and
report
so
much
;
I
write
,
as
you
usually
do
yourself
,
rather
with
a
view
to
the
future
than
to
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
rumour
be
already
rife
here
as
to
Dr.
Trefoil
's
successor
,
and
among
those
name
as
possible
future
dean
your
humble
servant
be
,
I
believe
,
not
the
least
frequently
speak
of
;
in
short
,
I
be
look
for
the
preferment
.
<EOS>
You
may
probably
know
that
since
Bishop
Proudie
come
to
the
diocese
I
have
exert
myself
here
a
good
deal
<EOS>
and
,
I
may
certainly
say
,
not
without
some
success
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
be
nearly
always
of
the
same
opinion
on
point
of
doctrine
as
well
as
church
discipline
,
and
therefore
I
have
have
,
as
his
confidential
chaplain
,
very
much
in
my
own
hand
;
but
I
confess
to
you
that
I
have
a
high
ambition
than
to
remain
the
chaplain
of
any
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
position
in
which
more
energy
be
now
need
than
those
of
our
dean
.
<EOS>
the
whole
of
our
enormous
cathedral
establishment
have
be
allow
to
go
to
sleep
 
<EOS>
nay
,
they
be
all
but
dead
and
ready
for
the
sepulchre
!
<EOS>
and
yet
of
what
prodigious
moment
they
may
be
make
if
,
as
be
intend
,
they
be
so
manage
as
to
lead
the
way
and
show
an
example
for
all
our
parochial
clergy
!
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
here
be
most
anxious
for
my
success
;
indeed
,
he
go
to
-
morrow
to
press
the
matter
on
the

<EOS>
I
believe
also
I
may
count
on
the
support
of
at
least
one
most
effective
member
of
the
government
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
the
support
of
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
if
I
be
think
worthy
of
it
,
would
be
more
gratify
to
me
than
any
other
;
more
gratify
if
by
it
I
should
be
successful
,
and
more
gratifying
also
<EOS>
if
,
although
so
support
,
I
should
be
unsuccessful
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
have
,
in
fact
,
come
in
which
no
government
can
venture
to
fill
up
the
high
place
of
the
Church
in
defiance
of
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
the
age
of
honourable
bishop
and
noble
dean
have
go
by
,
and
any
clergyman
however
humbly
bear
<EOS>
can
now
hope
for
success
if
his
industry
,
talent
,
and
character
be
sufficient
to
call
forth
the
manif
opinion
of
the
public
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
we
all
feel
that
any
counsel
give
in
such
matter
by
"
the
Jupiter
"
have
the
great
weight
 
be
,
indeed
,
generally
follow
;
and
we
feel
also
 
I
be
speak
of
clergyman
of
my
own
age
and
standing
 
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
patron
less
interested
than
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
and
none
that
more
thoroughly
understand
the
want
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
not
suspect
me
of
ask
from
you
any
support
which
the
paper
with
which
you
be
connect
can
not
conscientiously
give
me
.
<EOS>
My
object
in
writing
be
to
let
you
know
that
I
be
a
candidate
for
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
you
to
judge
whether
or
no
you
can
assist
my
view
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
,
of
course
,
have
write
to
you
on
such
a
matter
<EOS>
have
I
not
believe
(
and
I
have
have
good
reason
so
to
believe
)
that
"
the
Jupiter
"
approve
of
my
view
on
ecclesiastical
polity
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
express
a
fear
that
I
may
be
consider
too
young
for
such
a
station
,
my
age
be
thirty
-
six
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
that
at
the
present
day
any
hesitation
nee
be
feel
on
such
a
point
.
<EOS>
the
public
have
lose
its
love
for
antiquated
servant
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
will
ever
be
fit
to
do
good
work
,
he
will
be
fit
at
thirty
-
six
year
of
age
.
  
<EOS>

very
faithfully
your

<EOS>
have
thus
exert
himself
,
Mr.
Slope
post
his
letter
and
pass
the
remainder
of
the
evening
at
the
foot
of
his
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
will
be
accuse
of
deceit
in
his
mode
of
canvass
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
say
that
he
lie
in
the
application
he
make
to
each
of
his
three
patron
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
must
be
own
that
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hesitate
on
account
of
his
youth
and
yet
be
quite
assure
that
he
be
not
too
young
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
count
chiefly
on
the
bishop
's
support
and
chiefly
also
on
that
of
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
that
the
bishop
be
go
to
 
---
to
press
the
matter
on
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
in
his
canvass
Mr.
Slope
be
as
false
as
he
well
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
let
it
,
however
,
be
ask
of
those
who
be
conversant
with
such
matter
,
whether
he
be
more
false
than
man
usually
be
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
We
english
gentleman
hate
the
name
of
a
lie
,
but
how
often
do
we
find
public
man
who
believe
each
other
's
word
?
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
Victrix
 
<EOS>
the
next
week
pass
over
at
Barchester
with
much
apparent
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
the
heart
,
however
,
of
some
of
the
inhabitant
be
not
so
tranquil
as
the
street
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
the
poor
old
dean
still
continue
to
live
,
just
as
Sir
Omicron
Pie
have
prophesy
that
he
would
do
,
much
to
the
amazement
,
and
some
think
disgust
,
of
Dr.
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
still
remain
away
.
<EOS>
He
have
stay
a
day
or
two
in
town
and
have
also
remain
long
at
the
archbishop
's
than
he
have
intend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
as
yet
receive
no
line
in
answer
to
either
of
his
letter
,
but
he
have
learn
the
cause
of
this
.
<EOS>
Sir
Nicholas
be
stalk
a
deer
,
or
attend
the
Queen
,
in
the
Highlands
,
and
even
the
indefatigable
Mr.
Towers
have
steal
an
autumn
holiday
,
and
have
make
one
of
the
yearly
tribe
who
now
ascend
Mont
Blanc
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
learn
that
he
be
not
expect
back
till
the
last
day
of
September
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
be
throw
much
with
the
Stanhopes
,
of
whom
she
become
fonder
and
fonder
.
<EOS>
if
ask
,
she
would
have
say
that
Charlotte
Stanhope
be
her
especial
friend
,
and
so
she
would
have
think
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
like
Bertie
nearly
as
well
;
she
have
no
more
idea
of
regard
him
as
a
lover
than
she
would
have
have
of
look
at
a
big
tame
dog
in
such
a
light
.
<EOS>
Bertie
have
become
very
intimate
with
her
,
and
make
little
speech
to
her
,
and
say
little
thing
of
a
sort
very
different
from
the
speech
and
saying
of
other
man
.
<EOS>
but
then
this
be
almost
always
do
before
his
sister
;
and
he
,
with
his
long
silken
beard
,
his
light
blue
eye
,
and
strange
dress
,
be
so
unlike
other
man
.
<EOS>
She
admit
him
to
a
kind
of
familiarity
which
she
have
never
know
with
anyone
else
,
and
of
which
she
by
no
means
understand
the
danger
.
<EOS>
She
blush
once
at
find
that
she
have
call
him
Bertie
and
,
on
the
same
day
,
only
barely
remember
her
position
in
time
to
check
herself
from
play
upon
him
some
personal
practical
joke
to
which
she
be
instigate
by
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
this
Eleanor
be
perfectly
innocent
,
and
Bertie
Stanhope
could
hardly
be
call
guilty
.
<EOS>
but
every
familiarity
into
which
Eleanor
be
entrap
be
deliberately
plan
by
his
sister
.
<EOS>
She
know
well
how
to
play
her
game
,
and
play
it
without
mercy
;
she
know
,
none
<EOS>
so
well
,
what
be
her
brother
's
character
,
and
she
would
have
hand
over
to
him
the
young
widow
,
and
the
young
widow
's
money
,
and
the
money
of
the
widow
's
child
,
without
remorse
.
<EOS>
with
her
pretended
friendship
and
warm
cordiality
,
she
strove
to
connect
Eleanor
so
closely
with
her
brother
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
back
even
if
she
wish
it
.
<EOS>
but
Charlotte
Stanhope
know
really
nothing
of
Eleanor
's
character
,
do
not
even
understand
that
there
be
such
character
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
comprehend
that
a
young
and
pretty
woman
could
be
playful
and
familiar
with
a
man
such
as
Bertie
Stanhope
and
yet
have
no
idea
in
her
head
,
<EOS>
no
feeling
in
her
heart
,
that
she
would
have
be
ashamed
to
own
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
do
not
in
the
least
conceive
that
her
new
friend
be
a
woman
whom
nothing
could
entrap
into
an
inconsiderate
marriage
,
whose
mind
would
have
revolt
from
the
slight
impropriety
<EOS>
have
she
be
aware
that
any
impropriety
exist
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stanhope
,
however
,
have
tact
enough
to
make
herself
and
her
father
's
house
very
agreeable
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
there
be
with
them
all
an
absence
of
stiffness
and
formality
which
be
peculiarly
agreeable
to
Eleanor
after
the
great
dose
of
clerical
arrogance
which
she
have
lately
be
constrain
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
play
chess
with
them
,
walk
with
them
,
and
drink
tea
with
them
;
study
or
pretend
to
study
astronomy
;
assist
them
in
write
story
in
rhyme
,
in
turn
prose
tragedy
into
comic
verse
,
or
comic
story
into
would
-
be
tragic
poetry
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
idea
before
that
she
have
any
such
talent
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
her
do
such
thing
as
she
now
do
.
<EOS>
She
find
with
the
stanhope
new
amusement
and
employment
,
new
pursuit
,
which
in
themselves
could
not
be
wrong
,
and
which
be
exceedingly
alluring
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
not
a
pity
that
people
who
be
bright
and
clever
should
so
often
be
exceedingly
improper
,
and
that
those
who
be
never
improper
should
so
often
be
dull
and
heavy
?
<EOS>
now
Charlotte
Stanhope
be
always
bright
and
never
heavy
,
but
then
her
propriety
be
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
but
during
all
this
time
Eleanor
by
no
mean
forget
Mr.
Arabin
,
nor
do
she
forget
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
She
have
part
from
Mr.
Arabin
in
her
anger
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
angry
at
what
she
regard
as
his
impertinent
interference
,
but
nevertheless
she
look
forward
to
meet
him
again
,
and
also
look
forward
to
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
the
word
that
Mr.
Arabin
have
utter
still
sound
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
if
not
intend
for
a
declaration
of
love
,
they
do
signify
that
he
love
her
,
and
she
feel
also
that
if
he
ever
do
make
such
a
declaration
,
it
may
be
that
she
should
not
receive
it
unkindly
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
angry
with
him
,
very
angry
with
him
;
so
angry
that
she
would
bite
her
lip
and
stamp
her
foot
as
she
think
of
what
he
have
say
and
do
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
yearn
to
let
him
know
that
he
be
forgive
;
all
that
she
require
be
that
he
should
own
that
he
have
sin
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
to
meet
him
at
Ullathorne
on
the
last
day
of
the
present
month
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
have
invite
all
the
country
round
to
a
breakfast
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
tent
,
and
archery
,
and
dance
for
the
lady
on
the
lawn
and
for
the
swain
and
girl
in
the
paddock
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
fiddler
and
fifer
,
race
for
the
boy
,
pole
to
be
climb
,
ditch
full
of
water
to
be
jump
over
,
horse
-
collar
to
be
grin
through
(
this
latter
amusement
be
an
addition
of
the
steward
,
and
not
arrange
by
Miss
Thorne
in
the
original
programme
)
,
and
every
game
to
be
play
which
,
in
a
long
course
of
reading
,
Miss
Thorne
could
ascertain
to
have
be
play
in
the
good
day
of
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
everything
of
more
modern
growth
be
to
be
taboo
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
on
one
subject
Miss
Thorne
be
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
turn
in
her
mind
the
matter
of
a
bull
-
ring
,
but
could
not
succeed
in
make
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
for
the
world
have
do
,
or
allow
to
be
do
,
anything
that
be
cruel
;
as
to
the
promote
the
torture
of
a
bull
for
the
amusement
of
her
young
neighbour
,
it
need
hardly
be
say
that
Miss
Thorne
would
be
the
last
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
something
so
charming
in
the
name
.
<EOS>
a
bull
-
ring
,
however
,
without
a
bull
would
only
be
a
memento
of
the
decadence
of
the
time
,
and
she
feel
herself
constrain
to
abandon
the
idea
.
<EOS>
Quintains
,
however
,
she
be
determine
to
have
,
and
have
pole
and
swivel
and
bag
of
flour
prepare
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
would
no
doubt
have
be
anxious
for
something
small
in
the
way
of
a
tournament
,
but
,
as
she
say
to
her
brother
,
that
have
be
try
,
and
the
age
have
prove
itself
too
decidedly
inferior
to
its
forerunner
to
admit
of
such
a
pastime
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
do
not
seem
to
participate
much
in
her
regret
,
feel
perhaps
that
a
full
suit
of
chain
-
armour
would
have
add
but
little
to
his
own
personal
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
this
party
at
Ullathorne
have
be
plan
in
the
first
place
as
a
sort
of
welcome
to
Mr.
Arabin
on
his
entrance
into
St.
Ewold
's
parsonage
;
an
intend
harvest
-
home
gala
for
the
labourer
and
their
wife
and
child
have
subsequently
be
amalgamate
with
it
,
and
thus
it
have
grow
to
its
present
dimension
.
<EOS>
all
the
Plumstead
party
have
of
course
be
ask
,
and
at
the
time
of
the
invitation
Eleanor
have
intend
to
have
go
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
now
her
plan
be
alter
,
and
she
be
go
with
the
Stanhopes
.
<EOS>
the
Proudies
be
also
to
be
there
,
and
,
as
Mr.
Slope
have
not
be
include
in
the
invitation
to
the
palace
,
the
signora
,
whose
impudence
never
desert
her
,
ask
permission
of
Miss
Thorne
to
bring
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
permission
Miss
Thorne
give
,
have
no
other
alternative
;
but
she
do
so
with
a
tremble
heart
,
fear
Mr.
Arabin
would
be
offend
.
<EOS>
immediately
on
his
return
she
apologize
,
almost
with
tear
,
so
dire
an
enmity
be
presume
to
rage
between
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Arabin
comfort
her
by
an
assurance
that
he
should
meet
Mr.
Slope
with
the
great
pleasure
imaginable
and
make
her
promise
that
she
would
introduce
them
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
triumph
of
Mr.
Slope
's
be
not
so
agreeable
to
Eleanor
,
who
since
her
return
to
Barchester
have
do
her
good
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
way
to
the
Plumstead
folk
when
they
so
ungenerously
accuse
her
of
be
in
love
with
this
odious
man
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
know
that
she
be
so
accuse
,
she
be
fully
alive
to
the
expediency
of
keep
out
of
his
way
and
drop
him
by
degree
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
very
little
of
him
since
her
return
.
<EOS>
Her
servant
have
be
instruct
to
say
to
all
visitor
that
she
be
out
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
specify
Mr.
Slope
particularly
,
and
in
order
to
avoid
him
she
have
thus
debar
herself
from
all
her
friend
.
<EOS>
She
have
except
Charlotte
Stanhope
and
,
by
degree
,
a
few
other
also
.
<EOS>
once
she
have
meet
him
at
the
Stanhopes
"
,
but
as
a
rule
,
Mr.
Slope
's
visit
there
be
make
in
the
morning
and
her
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
on
that
one
occasion
Charlotte
have
manage
to
preserve
her
from
any
annoyance
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
good
-
natured
on
the
part
of
Charlotte
,
as
Eleanor
think
,
and
also
very
sharp
-
witted
,
as
Eleanor
have
tell
her
friend
nothing
of
her
reason
for
wish
to
avoid
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
fact
,
however
,
be
that
Charlotte
have
learn
from
her
sister
that
Mr.
Slope
would
probably
put
himself
forward
as
a
suitor
for
the
widow
's
hand
,
and
she
be
consequently
sufficiently
alive
to
the
expediency
of
guard
Bertie
's
future
wife
from
any
danger
in
that
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
the
stanhope
be
pledge
to
take
Mr.
Slope
with
them
to
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
an
arrangement
be
therefore
necessarily
make
,
which
be
very
disagreeable
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
,
with
herself
,
Charlotte
,
and
Mr.
Slope
,
be
to
go
together
,
and
Bertie
be
to
follow
with
his
sister
Madeline
.
<EOS>
It
be
clearly
visible
by
Eleanor
's
face
that
this
assortment
be
very
disagreeable
to
her
,
and
Charlotte
,
who
be
much
encourage
thereby
in
her
own
little
plan
,
make
a
thousand
apology
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
do
not
like
it
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
we
could
not
manage
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Bertie
would
give
his
eye
to
go
with
you
,
but
Madeline
can
not
possibly
go
without
him
.
<EOS>
nor
could
we
possibly
put
Mr.
Slope
and
Madeline
in
the
same
carriage
without
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
They
would
both
be
ruin
forever
,
you
know
,
and
not
admit
inside
ullathorne
gate
,
I
should
imagine
,
after
such
an
impropriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
that
would
not
do
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
but
could
not
I
go
in
the
carriage
with
the
signora
and
your
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
impossible
!
"
say
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
when
she
be
there
,
there
be
only
room
for
two
.
"
<EOS>
the
Signora
,
in
truth
,
do
not
care
to
do
her
travelling
in
the
presence
of
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
you
be
all
so
kind
,
Charlotte
,
and
so
good
to
me
that
I
be
sure
you
will
not
be
offend
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
will
not
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
go
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
what
nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
you
shall
.
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
absolutely
determine
in
family
counsel
that
Bertie
should
propose
on
that
very
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
or
I
can
take
a
fly
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
be
not
embarrass
by
so
many
difficulty
as
you
young
lady
;
I
can
go
alone

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
do
not
think
of
such
a
thing
;
after
all
,
it
be
only
for
an
hour
or
so
;
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
you
dislike
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
and
Mr.
Slope
be
great
friend
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
you
dislike
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
nothing
particular
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
only
I
think
it
would
be
a
family
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
would
be
much
nice
,
much
more
snug
,
if
Bertie
could
go
with
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
that
be
badly
treat
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
he
be
much
more
afraid
of
Mr.
Slope
than
you
be
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
Madeline
can
not
go
out
without
him
 
and
she
,
poor
creature
,
go
out
so
seldom
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
do
not
begrudge
her
this
,
though
her
vagary
do
knock
about
our
own
party
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
Eleanor
make
a
thousand
protestation
and
utter
a
thousand
hope
that
Madeline
would
enjoy
herself
.
<EOS>
and
of
course
she
have
to
give
way
and
undertake
to
go
in
the
carriage
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
she
be
drive
either
to
do
this
or
to
explain
why
she
would
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
now
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
explain
to
Charlotte
Stanhope
all
that
have
pass
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
to
her
a
sore
necessity
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
a
thousand
little
scheme
for
avoid
it
;
she
would
plead
illness
and
not
go
at
all
;
she
would
persuade
Mary
Bold
to
go
,
although
not
ask
,
and
then
make
a
necessity
of
have
a
carriage
of
her
own
to
take
her
sister
-
in
-
law
;
anything
,
in
fact
,
she
could
do
,
rather
than
be
see
by
Mr.
Arabin
get
out
of
the
same
carriage
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
the
momentous
morning
come
,
she
have
no
scheme
mature
,
and
then
Mr.
Slope
hand
her
into
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
and
,
follow
her
step
,
sit
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
return
on
the
eve
of
the
Ullathorne
party
,
and
be
receive
at
home
with
radiant
smile
by
the
partner
of
all
his
care
.
<EOS>
on
his
arrival
he
creep
up
to
his
dressing
-
room
with
somewhat
of
a
palpitate
heart
;
he
have
overstay
his
allot
time
by
three
day
,
and
be
not
without
much
fear
of
penalty
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
could
be
more
affectionately
cordial
than
the
greeting
he
receive
;
the
girl
come
out
and
kiss
him
in
a
manner
that
be
quite
soothing
to
his
spirit
;
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
albeit
,
unused
to
the
melt
mood
,
"
squeeze
him
in
her
arm
and
almost
in
word
call
him
her
dear
,
darling
,
good
,
<EOS>
pet
,
little
bishop
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
a
very
pleasant
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
have
somewhat
change
her
tactic
;
not
that
she
have
see
any
cause
to
disapprove
of
her
former
line
of
conduct
,
but
she
have
now
bring
matter
to
such
a
point
that
she
calculate
that
she
may
safely
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
get
the
well
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
she
now
think
well
to
show
her
husband
that
when
allow
to
get
the
well
of
everybody
,
when
obey
by
him
and
permit
to
rule
over
other
,
she
would
take
care
that
he
should
have
his
reward
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
not
a
chance
against
her
;
not
only
could
she
stun
the
poor
bishop
by
her
midnight
anger
,
but
she
could
assuage
and
soothe
him
,
if
she
so
will
,
by
daily
indulgence
.
<EOS>
She
could
furnish
his
room
for
him
,
turn
him
out
as
smart
a
bishop
as
any
on
the
bench
,
give
him
good
dinner
,
warm
fire
,
and
an
easy
life
 
<EOS>
all
this
she
would
do
if
he
would
but
be
quietly
obedient
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
not
,
 
!
to
speak
sooth
,
however
,
his
suffering
on
that
dreadful
night
have
be
so
poignant
as
to
leave
him
little
spirit
for
further
rebellion
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
dress
himself
,
she
return
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
enjoy
yourself
at
 
---
,
"
say
she
,
seat
herself
on
one
side
of
the
fire
while
he
remain
in
his
armchair
on
the
other
,
stroke
the
calf
of
his
leg
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
he
have
have
a
fire
in
his
room
since
the
summer
,
and
it
please
him
,
for
the
good
bishop
love
to
be
warm
and
cosy
.
<EOS>
yes
,
he
say
,
he
have
enjoy
himself
very
much
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
polite
than
the
archbishop
,
and
Mrs.
Archbishop
have
be
equally
charming
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
be
delighted
to
hear
it
;
nothing
,
she
declare
,
please
her
so
much
as
to
think
  
Her
bairn
respectit
like
the
lave
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
put
it
precisely
in
these
word
,
but
what
she
say
come
to
the
same
thing
;
and
then
,
have
pet
and
fondle
her
little
man
sufficiently
,
she
proceed
to
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
poor

still
alive

she

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I

say
the
bishop

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>

"
fill
up

Mrs.

of
the
wonte

to
her

the

feel
himself
to
be
a
little
less
comfortable
than
before

fill
up
the

that
is
,
if
the
dean

very
little

It

mention

just
mention

<EOS>

and
what
do
you
say
about
it

Bishop
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why

I
say

I
think

as
he
go
on
stammer
and
flounder
,
he
see
that
his
wife

eye
be
fix
sternly
on
him

<EOS>
why
should
he
encounter
such
evil
for
a
man
whom
he
love
so
slightly
as
Mr.

<EOS>
why
should
he
give
up
his
enjoyment
and
his
ease
and
such
dignity
as
may
be
allow
to
him
to
fight
a
lose
battle
for
a

<EOS>
the
chaplain
,
after
all
,
if
successful
,
would
be
as
great
a
tyrant
as
his

<EOS>
why
fight
at
all
?
<EOS>
why
contend
?
<EOS>
why
be
uneasy

<EOS>
from
that
moment
he
determine
to
fle
Mr.

He

I
will

Mrs.

now
,
among

Mrs.

I

so
well

you

to
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
get
on
!
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
,
move
her
foot
uneasily
on
the
hearth
-
rug
and
compress
her
lip
in
a
manner
that
betoken
much
danger
to
the
subject
of
their
discourse

<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
find
that
he
be
objectionable
to
you

<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
foot
work
on
the
hearth
-
rug
with
great
rapidity
 
"
and
that
you
would
be
more
comfortable
if
he
be
out
of

palace
"
 
Mrs.
Proudie
smile
,
as
a
hyena
may
probably
smile
before
he
begin
his
laugh
 
"
and
therefore
I
think
that
if
he
get
this
place
,
and
so
cease
to
be
my
chaplain
,
you
may
be
pleased
at
such
an
arrangement

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
hyena
laugh
out
.
<EOS>
pleased
at
such
an
arrangement
!
<EOS>
pleased
at
have
her
enemy
convert
into
a
dean
with
twelve
hundred
a

!
<EOS>
Medea
,
when
she

assure
her
astonished

You

We

<EOS>
"
We

<EOS>
say
she

with
terrific
energy

<EOS>
Mrs.

she
have
no
idea

not
eat
Mr.

<EOS>
pardon
him

<EOS>
merely
get
rid
of
him

<EOS>
make
a

of
him

<EOS>
It
be
not
so
they
do
with
their
captive
in
her
country

among
people
of
her
sort
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
no
such
mercy
to
expect
;
she
would
pick
him
to
the
very
last
bone
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
my
dear
,
of
course
he
will
cease
to
be
your
chaplain
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
,
that
must
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
a
moment
think
of
live
in
the
same
house
with
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
have
show
himself
quite
unfit
for
such
a
situation
;
make
broil
and
quarrel
among
the
clergy
;
get
you
,
my
dear
,
into
scrape
;
and
take
upon
himself
as
though
he
be
as
good
as
bishop
himself
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
will
go
.
<EOS>
but
because
he
leave
the
palace
,
that
be
no
reason
why
he
should
get
into
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
of
course
not
!
"
say
the
bishop
;
"
but
to
save
appearance
,
you
know
,
my
dear
 
"
  
"
I
do
not
want
to
save
appearance
;
I
want
Mr.
Slope
to
appear
just
what
he
be
 
a
false
,
designing
,
mean
,
intriguing
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
eye
on
him
;
he
little
know
what
I
see
.
<EOS>
He
be
misconduct
himself
in
the
most
disgraceful
way
with
that
lame
italian
woman
.
<EOS>
that
family
be
a
disgrace
to
Barchester
,
and
Mr.
Slope
be
a
disgrace
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
look
well
to
it
,
he
will
have
his
gown
strip
off
his
back
instead
of
have
a
dean
's
hat
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
Dean
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
the
man
have
go
mad
with
arrogance
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
say
nothing
further
to
excuse
either
himself
or
his
chaplain
,
and
have
show
himself
passive
and
docile
,
be
again
take
into
favour
.
<EOS>
They
soon
go
to
dinner
,
and
he
spend
the
pleasantest
evening
he
have
have
in
his
own
house
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
play
and
sing
to
him
as
he
sip
his
coffee
and
read
his
newspaper
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
ask
good
-
natured
little
question
about
the
archbishop
;
and
then
he
go
happily
to
bed
and
sleep
as
quietly
as
though
Mrs.
Proudie
have
be
Griselda
herself
.
<EOS>
while
shave
himself
in
the
morning
and
prepare
for
the
festivity
of
Ullathorne
,
he
fully
resolve
to
run
no
more
tilt
against
a
warrior
so
fully
armed
at
all
point
as
be
Mrs.
Proudie
.
   
<EOS>
Oxford
 
<EOS>
the
Master
and
Tutor
of
Lazarus
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
we
have
say
,
have
but
a
sad
walk
of
it
under
the
tree
of
plumstead
churchyard
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
appear
to
any
of
the
family
till
dinner
-
time
,
and
then
he
seem
,
as
far
as
their
judgement
go
,
to
be
quite
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
as
be
his
will
not
,
ask
himself
a
great
many
question
and
give
himself
a
great
many
answer
;
and
the
upshot
of
this
be
that
he
have
send
himself
down
for
an
ass
.
<EOS>
He
have
determine
that
he
be
much
too
old
and
much
too
rusty
to
commence
the
manoeuvre
of
love
-
making
;
that
he
have
let
the
time
slip
through
his
hand
which
should
have
be
use
for
such
purpose
;
and
that
now
he
must
lie
on
his
bed
as
he
have
make
it
.
<EOS>
then
he
ask
himself
whether
in
truth
he
do
love
this
woman
;
and
he
answer
himself
,
not
without
a
long
struggle
,
but
at
last
honestly
,
that
he
certainly
do
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
himself
whether
he
do
not
also
love
her
money
,
and
he
again
answer
himself
that
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
here
he
do
not
answer
honestly
.
<EOS>
It
be
and
ever
have
be
his
weakness
to
look
for
impure
motive
for
his
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
circumstance
as
he
be
,
with
a
small
living
and
a
fellowship
,
accustom
as
he
have
be
to
collegiate
luxury
and
expensive
comfort
,
he
may
have
hesitate
to
marry
a
penniless
woman
<EOS>
have
he
feel
ever
so
strong
a
predilection
for
the
woman
herself
;
<EOS>
no
doubt
Eleanor
's
fortune
put
all
such
difficulty
out
of
the
question
;
but
it
be
equally
without
doubt
that
his
love
for
her
have
creep
upon
him
without
the
slight
idea
on
his
part
that
he
could
ever
benefit
his
own
condition
by
share
her
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
stand
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
count
the
pattern
and
count
also
the
future
chance
of
his
own
life
,
the
remembrance
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
comfortable
income
have
certainly
not
damp
his
first
assured
feeling
of
love
for
her
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
it
have
do
so
?
<EOS>
need
it
have
do
so
with
the
pure
of
man
?
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Arabin
decide
against
himself
;
he
decide
that
it
have
do
so
in
his
case
,
and
that
he
be
not
the
pure
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
also
decide
,
which
be
more
to
his
purpose
,
that
Eleanor
do
not
care
a
straw
for
him
,
and
that
very
probably
she
do
care
a
straw
for
his
rival
.
<EOS>
then
he
make
up
his
mind
not
to
think
of
her
any
more
,
and
go
on
thinking
of
her
till
he
be
almost
in
a
state
to
drown
himself
in
the
little
brook
which
run
at
the
bottom
of
the
archdeacon
's
ground
.
  
<EOS>
and
ever
and
again
his
mind
would
revert
to
the
Signora
Neroni
,
and
he
would
make
comparison
between
her
and
Eleanor
Bold
,
not
always
in
favour
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
the
signora
have
listen
to
him
,
and
flatter
him
,
and
believe
in
him
;
at
least
she
have
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
have
also
listen
to
him
,
but
have
never
flatter
him
;
have
not
always
believe
in
him
;
and
now
have
break
from
him
in
violent
rage
.
<EOS>
the
signora
,
too
,
be
the
more
lovely
woman
of
the
two
,
and
have
also
the
additional
attraction
of
her
affliction
 
for
to
him
it
be
an
attraction
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
never
could
have
love
the
Signora
Neroni
as
he
feel
that
he
now
love
Eleanor
;
and
so
he
fling
stone
into
the
brook
,
instead
of
fling
in
himself
,
and
sit
down
on
its
margin
as
sad
a
gentleman
as
you
shall
meet
in
a
summer
's
day
.
  
<EOS>
He
hear
the
dinner
-
bell
ring
from
the
churchyard
,
and
he
know
that
it
be
time
to
recover
his
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
be
disgrace
himself
in
his
own
eye
,
that
he
have
be
idle
his
time
and
neglect
the
high
duty
which
he
have
take
upon
himself
to
perform
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
spend
this
afternoon
among
the
poor
at
St.
Ewold
's
,
instead
of
wander
about
at
Plumstead
,
an
ancient
,
love
-
lorn
swain
,
deject
and
sighing
,
full
of
imaginary
sorrow
and
wertherian
grief
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
,
and
determine
to
lose
no
time
in
retrieve
his
character
,
so
damaged
in
his
own
eye
.
  
<EOS>
thus
when
he
appear
at
dinner
he
be
as
animate
as
ever
and
be
the
author
of
most
of
the
conversation
which
grace
the
archdeacon
's
board
on
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
ill
at
ease
and
sick
at
heart
,
and
do
not
care
to
appear
more
comfortable
than
he
really
be
;
what
little
he
do
say
be
say
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Arabin
have
league
together
against
Eleanor
's
comfort
,
and
his
wish
now
be
to
break
away
from
the
pair
and
undergo
in
his
Barchester
lodging
whatever
Fate
have
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
hate
the
name
of
the
hospital
;
his
attempt
to
regain
his
lost
inheritance
there
have
bring
upon
him
so
much
suffer
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
he
be
concern
,
Mr.
Quiverful
be
now
welcome
to
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
archdeacon
be
not
very
lively
.
<EOS>
the
poor
dean
's
illness
be
of
course
discuss
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
do
not
mention
Mr.
Slope
's
name
in
connexion
with
the
expect
event
of
Dr.
Trefoil
's
death
;
he
do
not
wish
to
say
anything
about
Mr.
Slope
just
at
present
,
nor
do
he
wish
to
make
known
his
sad
surmise
;
but
the
idea
that
his
enemy
may
possibly
become
Dean
of
Barchester
make
him
very
gloomy
.
<EOS>
Should
such
an
event
take
place
,
such
a
dire
catastrophe
come
about
,
there
would
be
an
end
to
his
life
as
far
as
his
life
be
connect
with
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
must
give
up
all
his
old
haunt
,
all
his
old
habit
,
and
live
quietly
as
a
retire
rector
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
severe
trial
for
him
to
have
Dr.
Proudie
in
the
palace
,
but
with
Mr.
Slope
also
in
the
deanery
<EOS>
he
feel
that
he
should
be
unable
to
draw
his
breath
in
Barchester
close
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
in
spite
of
the
sorrow
at
his
heart
,
Mr.
Arabin
be
apparently
the
gay
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
both
Mr.
Harding
and
Mrs.
Grantly
be
in
a
slight
degree
angry
with
him
on
account
of
his
want
of
gloom
.
<EOS>
to
the
one
it
appear
as
though
he
be
triumph
at
Eleanor
's
banishment
,
and
to
the
other
that
he
be
not
affect
as
he
should
have
be
by
all
the
sad
circumstance
of
the
day
 
Eleanor
's
obstinacy
,
Mr.
Slope
's
success
,
and
the
poor
dean
's
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
be
all
at
cross
-
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
leave
the
room
almost
together
with
the
lady
,
and
then
the
archdeacon
open
his
heart
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
still
harp
upon
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
that
fellow
mean
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
say
in
his
letter
to
Mrs.
Bold
that
if
Mr.
Harding
would
call
on
the
bishop
,
it
would
be
all
right
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
would
not
be
guide
by
anything
he
may
say
,
but
still
it
may
be
well
that
Mr.
Harding
should
see
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
foolish
to
let
the
thing
slip
through
our
finger
because
Mrs.
Bold
be
determined
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
hint
that
he
be
not
quite
so
sure
that
Mrs.
Bold
would
make
a
fool
of
herself
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
he
be
not
convince
that
she
do
regard
Mr.
Slope
so
warmly
as
she
be
suppose
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
question
and
cross
-
question
him
about
this
,
but
elicit
nothing
,
and
at
last
remain
firm
in
his
own
conviction
that
he
be
destine
,
_
malgré
lui
_
,
to
be
the
brother
-
in
-
law
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
strongly
advise
that
Mr.
Harding
should
take
no
step
regard
the
hospital
in
connexion
with
,
or
in
consequence
of
,
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
bishop
really
mean
to
confer
the
appointment
on
Mr.
Harding
,
"
argue
Mr.
Arabin
,
"
he
will
take
care
to
let
him
have
some
other
intimation
than
a
message
convey
through
a
letter
to
a
lady
.
<EOS>
be
Mr.
Harding
to
present
himself
at
the
palace
,
he
may
merely
be
play
Mr.
Slope
's
game
;
"
and
thus
it
be
settle
that
nothing
should
be
do
till
the
great
Dr.
Gwynne
's
arrival
,
or
at
any
rate
without
that
potentate
's
sanction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
droll
to
observe
how
these
man
talk
of
Mr.
Harding
as
though
he
be
a
puppet
,
and
plan
their
intrigue
and
small
ecclesiastical
manoeuvre
in
reference
to
Mr.
Harding
's
future
position
without
dream
of
take
him
into
their
confidence
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
comfortable
house
and
income
in
question
,
and
it
be
very
desirable
,
and
certainly
very
just
,
that
Mr.
Harding
should
have
them
;
but
that
at
present
be
not
the
main
point
;
it
be
expedient
to
beat
the
bishop
and
,
if
possible
,
to
smash
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
set
up
,
or
be
suppose
to
have
set
up
,
a
rival
candidate
.
<EOS>
of
all
thing
the
most
desirable
would
have
be
to
have
have
Mr.
Quiverful
's
appointment
publish
to
the
public
and
then
annul
by
the
clamour
of
an
indignant
world
,
loud
in
the
defence
of
Mr.
Harding
's
right
.
<EOS>
but
of
such
an
event
the
chance
be
small
;
a
slight
fraction
only
of
the
world
would
be
indignant
,
and
that
fraction
would
be
one
not
accustomed
to
loud
speak
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
preferment
have

sort

way

offer
to
Mr.
Harding
and
have
,
in
a
sort
of
way
,
be
refuse
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
wicked
,
cunne
hand
have
be
peculiarly
conspicuous
in
the
way
in
which
this
have
be
bring
to
pass
,
and
it
be
the
success
of
Mr.
Slope
's
cunning
which
be
so
painfully
grate
to
the
feeling
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
that
which
of
all
thing
he
most
dreaded
be
that
he
should
be
outgeneral
by
Mr.
Slope
;
and
just
at
present
it
appear
probable
that
Mr.
Slope
would
turn
his
flank
,
steal
a
march
on
him
,
cut
off
his
provision
,
carry
his
strong
town
by
a
_
coup
de
main
_
,
and
at
last
beat
him
thoroughly
in
a
regular
pitch
battle
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
feel
that
his
flank
have
be
turn
when
desire
to
wait
on
Mr.
Slope
instead
of
the
bishop
,
that
a
march
have
be
steal
when
Mr.
Harding
be
induce
to
refuse
the
bishop
's
offer
,
that
his
provision
would
be
cut
off
when
Mr.
Quiverful
get
the
hospital
,
that
Eleanor
be
the
strong
town
doom
to
be
take
,
and
that
Mr.
Slope
,
as
Dean
of
Barchester
,
would
be
regard
by
all
the
world
as
conqueror
in
the
final
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
be
the
_
Deus
ex
machina
_
who
be
to
come
down
upon
the
Barchester
stage
and
bring
about
deliverance
from
these
terrible
evil
.
<EOS>
but
how
can
melodramatic
_
dénouement
_
be
properly
bring
about
,
how
can
vice
and
Mr.
Slope
be
punish
,
and
virtue
and
the
archdeacon
be
reward
,
while
the
avenge
god
be
lay
up
with
the
gout
?
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
evil
may
be
triumphant
,
and
poor
innocence
,
transfix
to
the
earth
by
an
arrow
from
Dr.
Proudie
's
quiver
,
may
lie
dead
upon
the
ground
,
not
to
be
resuscitate
even
by
Dr.
Gwynne
.
  
<EOS>
two
or
three
day
after
Eleanor
's
departure
,
Mr.
Arabin
go
to
Oxford
and
soon
find
himself
closet
with
the
august
head
of
his
college
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
that
Dr.
Gwynne
be
not
very
sanguine
as
to
the
effect
of
his
journey
to
Barchester
,
and
not
over
-
anxious
to
interfere
with
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
the
gout
,
but
be
very
nearly
convalescent
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
at
once
see
that
have
the
mission
be
one
of
which
the
master
thoroughly
approve
,
he
would
before
this
have
be
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Dr.
Gwynne
be
resolve
on
visit
his
friend
,
and
willingly
promise
to
return
to
Barchester
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
there
be
any
probability
that
Mr.
Slope
would
be
make
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
rumour
,
he
say
,
have
reach
even
his
ear
,
not
at
all
favourable
to
that
gentleman
's
character
,
and
he
express
himself
strongly
of
opinion
that
any
such
appointment
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
,
the
master
's
right
-
hand
man
,
Tom
Staple
,
be
call
in
to
assist
at
the
conference
.
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
be
the
Tutor
of
Lazarus
and
,
moreover
,
a
great
man
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
though
universally
know
by
a
species
of
nomenclature
so
very
undignified
,
Tom
Staple
be
one
who
maintain
a
high
dignity
in
the
university
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
as
it
be
,
the
leader
of
the
Oxford
tutor
,
a
body
of
man
who
consider
themselves
collectively
as
be
by
very
little
,
if
at
all
,
second
in
importance
to
the
head
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
always
the
case
that
the
master
,
or
warden
,
or
provost
,
or
principal
can
hit
it
off
exactly
with
his
tutor
.
<EOS>
a
tutor
be
by
no
mean
indispose
to
have
a
will
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
but
at
Lazarus
they
be
great
friend
and
firm
ally
at
the
time
of
which
we
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
be
a
hale
,
strong
man
of
about
forty
-
five
,
short
in
stature
,
swarthy
in
face
,
<EOS>
with
strong
,
sturdy
black
hair
and
crisp
black
beard
of
which
very
little
be
allow
to
show
itself
in
shape
of
whisker
.
<EOS>
He
always
wear
a
white
neckcloth
,
clean
indeed
,
but
not
tie
with
that
scrupulous
care
which
now
distinguish
some
of
our
young
clergy
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
of
course
,
always
clothe
in
a
seemly
suit
of
solemn
black
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Staple
be
a
decent
cleanly
liver
,
not
over
-
addict
to
any
sensuality
;
but
nevertheless
a
somewhat
warmish
hue
be
begin
to
adorn
his
nose
,
the
peculiar
effect
,
as
his
friend
aver
,
of
a
certain
pipe
of
port
introduce
into
the
cellar
of
Lazarus
the
very
same
year
in
which
the
tutor
enter
it
as
a
freshman
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
,
perhaps
,
a
little
redolence
of
port
wine
,
as
it
be
the
slight
possible
twang
,
in
Mr.
Staple
's
voice
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
latter
day
Tom
Staple
be
not
a
happy
man
;
university
reform
have
long
be
his
bugbear
,
and
now
be
his
bane
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
with
him
,
as
with
most
other
,
an
affair
of
politic
,
respect
which
,
when
the
need
exist
,
he
could
,
for
party
<EOS>
"
sake
or
on
behalf
of
principle
,
maintain
a
certain
amount
of
necessary
zeal
;
it
be
not
with
him
a
subject
for
dilettante
warfare
and
courteous
,
commonplace
opposition
.
<EOS>
to
him
it
be
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
the
_
status
quo
_
of
the
university
be
his
only
idea
of
life
,
and
any
reformation
be
as
bad
to
him
as
death
.
<EOS>
He
would
willingly
have
be
a
martyr
in
the
cause
,
have
the
cause
admit
of
martyrdom
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
present
day
,
unfortunately
,
public
affair
will
allow
of
no
martyr
,
and
therefore
it
be
that
there
be
such
a
deficiency
of
zeal
.
<EOS>
Could
gentleman
of
£
10,000
a
year
have
die
on
their
own
door
-
step
in
defence
of
protection
,
no
doubt
some
half
-
dozen
glorious
old
baronet
would
have
so
fall
,
and
the
school
of
protection
would
at
this
day
have
be
crowd
with
scholar
.
<EOS>
who
can
fight
strenuously
in
any
combat
in
which
there
be
no
danger
?
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
would
have
willingly
be
impale
before
a
Committee
of
the
House
,
could
he
by
such
self
-
sacrifice
have
infuse
his
own
spirit
into
the
component
member
of
the
hebdomadal
board
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
be
one
of
those
who
in
his
heart
approve
of
the
credit
system
which
have
of
old
be
in
vogue
between
the
student
and
tradesman
of
the
university
.
<EOS>
He
know
and
acknowledge
to
himself
that
it
be
useless
in
these
degenerate
day
publicly
to
contend
with
"
the
Jupiter
"
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
"
have
undertake
to
rule
the
university
,
and
Tom
Staple
be
well
aware
that
"
the
Jupiter
"
be
too
powerful
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
in
secret
,
and
among
his
safe
companion
,
he
would
argue
that
the
system
of
credit
be
an
ordeal
good
for
young
man
to
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
man
,
say
he
,
the
weak
and
worthless
,
blunder
into
danger
and
burn
their
foot
;
but
the
good
man
,
they
who
have
any
character
,
they
who
have
that
within
them
which
can
reflect
credit
on
their
alma
mater
,
they
come
through
scatheless
.
<EOS>
what
merit
will
there
be
to
a
young
man
to
get
through
safely
,
if
he
be
guard
and
protect
and
restrain
like
a
schoolboy
?
<EOS>
by
so
do
,
the
period
of
the
ordeal
be
only
postpone
,
and
the
manhood
of
the
man
will
be
defer
from
the
age
of
twenty
to
that
of
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
if
you
bind
him
with
lead
-
string
at
college
,
he
will
break
loose
while
eat
for
the
bar
in
London
;
bind
him
there
,
and
he
will
break
loose
afterwards
,
when
he
be
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
the
wild
oats
must
be
sow
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
Tom
Staple
would
argue
of
young
man
,
not
,
indeed
,
with
much
consistency
,
but
still
with
some
practical
knowledge
of
the
subject
gather
from
long
experience
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Tom
Staple
proffer
such
wisdom
as
he
have
for
the
assistance
of
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
say
he
,
argue
that
Mr.
Slope
could
not
possibly
be
make
the
new
Dean
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
think
,
"
say
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
no
standing
,
and
,
if
all
I
hear
be
true
,
very
little
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
as
to
character
,
"
say
Tom
Staple
,
"
I
do
not
think
much
of
that
.
<EOS>
They
rather
like
loose
parson
for
dean
;
a
little
fast
living
,
or
a
dash
of
infidelity
,
be
no
bad
recommendation
to
a
cathedral
close
.
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
make
Mr.
Slope
;
the
last
two
dean
have
be
Cambridge
man
;
you
will
not
show
me
an
instance
of
their
make
three
man
run
from
the
same
university
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
get
our
share
and
never
shall
,
I
suppose
,
but
we
must
at
least
have
one
out
of
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
sort
of
rule
be
all
go
by
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
everything
have
go
by
,
I
believe
,
"
say
Tom
Staple
.
<EOS>
"
the
cigar
have
be
smoke
out
,
and
we
be
the
ashe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
speak
for
yourself
,
Staple
,
"
say
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
for
all
,
"
say
the
tutor
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
come
to
that
,
that
there
will
be
no
life
leave
anywhere
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
any
longer
fit
to
rule
himself
,
or
those
belong
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
Government
be
to
find
us
all
in
everything
,
and
the
press
be
to
find
the
Government
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Slope
will
not
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
who
will
be
warden
of
the
hospital
?
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
that
Mr.
Quiverful
be
already
appoint
,
"
say
Tom
Staple
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
say
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
Dr.
Proudie
will
not
be
so
short
-
sight
as
to
run
against
such
a
rock
<EOS>
:
Mr.
Slope
should
himself
have
sense
enough
to
prevent
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
Mr.
Slope
may
have
no
objection
to
see
his
patron
on
a
rock
,
"
say
the
suspicious
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
could
he
get
by
that
?
"
ask
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
see
the
double
of
such
a
man
,
"
say
Mr.
Staple
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
quite
clear
that
Bishop
Proudie
be
altogether
in
his
hand
,
and
it
be
equally
clear
that
he
have
be
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
this
Mr.
Quiverful
into
the
hospital
,
although
he
must
know
that
such
an
appointment
would
be
most
damaging
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
understand
such
a
man
,
and
dreadful
to
think
,
"
add
Tom
Staple
,
sigh
deeply
,
"
that
the
welfare
and
fortune
of
good
man
may
depend
on
his
intrigue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
or
Mr.
Staple
be
not
in
the
least
aware
,
nor
even
be
Mr.
Arabin
,
that
this
Mr.
Slope
,
of
whom
they
be
talk
,
have
be
use
his
utmost
effort
to
put
their
own
candidate
into
the
hospital
,
and
that
in
lieu
of
be
permanent
in
the
palace
,
his
own
expulsion
therefrom
have
be
already
decide
on
by
the
high
power
of
the
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
"
say
the
tutor
,
"
if
this
Quiverful
be
thrust
into
the
hospital
and
Dr.
Trefoil
do
die
,
I
should
not
wonder
if
the
Government
be
to
make
Mr.
Harding
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
They
would
feel
bind
to
do
something
for
him
after
all
that
be
say
when
he
resign
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
at
the
moment
make
no
reply
to
this
suggestion
,
but
it
do
not
the
less
impress
itself
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Harding
could
not
be
warden
of
the
hospital
,
why
should
he
not
be
Dean
of
Barchester
?
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
conference
end
without
any
very
fix
resolution
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Arabin
prepare
for
their
journey
to
plumstead
on
the
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
Fête
Champêtre
 
<EOS>
the
day
of
the
Ullathorne
party
arrive
,
and
all
the
world
be
there
 
or
at
least
so
much
of
the
world
as
have
be
include
in
Miss
Thorne
's
invitation
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
say
,
the
bishop
return
home
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
on
the
same
evening
and
by
the
same
train
come
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Arabin
from
Oxford
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
with
his
brougham
be
in
wait
for
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
so
that
there
be
a
goodly
show
of
church
dignitary
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
.
  
<EOS>
the
Stanhope
party
be
finally
arrange
in
the
odious
manner
already
describe
,
and
Eleanor
get
into
the
doctor
's
carriage
full
of
apprehension
and
presentiment
of
further
misfortune
,
whereas
Mr.
Slope
enter
the
vehicle
elate
with
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
receive
that
morning
a
very
civil
note
from
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
,
not
promise
much
,
indeed
,
but
then
Mr.
Slope
know
,
or
fancy
that
he
know
,
that
it
be
not
etiquette
for
government
officer
to
make
promise
.
<EOS>
though
Sir
Nicholas
promise
nothing
he
imply
a
good
deal
,
declare
his
conviction
that
Mr.
Slope
would
make
an
excellent
dean
,
and
wish
him
every
kind
of
success
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
add
that
,
not
be
in
the
cabinet
,
he
be
never
consult
on
such
matter
,
and
that
even
if
he
speak
on
the
subject
,
his
voice
would
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
Mr.
Slope
take
for
the
prudent
reserve
of
official
life
.
<EOS>
to
complete
his
anticipated
triumph
,
another
letter
be
bring
to
him
just
as
he
be
about
to
start
to
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
also
enjoy
the
idea
of
hand
Mrs.
Bold
out
of
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
before
the
multitude
at
Ullathorne
gate
as
much
as
Eleanor
dread
the
same
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
have
fully
make
up
his
mind
to
throw
himself
and
his
fortune
at
the
widow
's
foot
,
and
have
almost
determine
to
select
the
present
propitious
morning
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
signora
have
of
late
be
less
than
civil
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
indeed
admit
his
visit
and
listen
,
at
any
rate
without
anger
,
to
his
love
,
but
she
have
torture
him
and
revile
him
,
jeer
at
him
and
ridicule
him
,
while
she
allow
him
to
call
her
the
most
beautiful
of
live
woman
,
to
kiss
her
hand
,
and
to
proclaim
himself
with
reiterate
oath
her
adorer
,
her
slave
and
worshipper
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
be
in
great
perturbation
,
yet
in
great
glory
,
on
the
morning
of
the
gala
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
also
,
though
the
party
be
none
of
his
giving
,
have
much
heavy
work
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
most
overtasked
,
the
most
anxious
,
and
the
most
effective
of
all
the
ullathorne
household
be
Mr.
Plomacy
,
the
steward
.
<EOS>
this
last
personage
have
,
in
the
time
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
father
,
when
the
Directory
hold
dominion
in
France
,
go
over
to
Paris
with
letter
in
his
boot
-
heel
for
some
of
the
royal
party
,
and
such
have
be
his
good
luck
that
he
have
return
safe
.
<EOS>
He
have
then
be
very
young
and
be
now
very
old
,
but
the
exploit
give
him
a
character
for
political
enterprise
and
secret
discretion
which
still
avail
him
as
thoroughly
as
it
have
do
in
its
fresh
gloss
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
have
be
steward
of
Ullathorne
for
more
than
fifty
year
,
and
a
very
easy
life
he
have
have
of
it
.
<EOS>
who
could
require
much
absolute
work
from
a
man
who
have
carry
safely
at
his
heel
that
which
,
if
discover
,
would
have
cost
him
his
head
?
<EOS>
consequently
Mr.
Plomacy
have
never
work
hard
,
and
of
latter
year
have
never
work
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
taste
for
timber
,
and
therefore
he
mark
the
tree
that
be
to
be
cut
down
;
he
have
a
taste
for
gardening
,
and
would
therefore
allow
no
shrub
to
be
plant
or
bed
to
be
make
without
his
express
sanction
.
<EOS>
in
these
matter
he
be
sometimes
drive
to
run
counter
to
his
mistress
,
but
he
rarely
allow
his
mistress
to
carry
the
point
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
on
occasion
such
as
the
present
Mr.
Plomacy
come
out
strong
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
honour
of
the
family
at
heart
;
he
thoroughly
appreciate
the
duty
of
hospitality
;
and
therefore
,
when
gala
doing
be
go
on
,
he
always
take
the
management
into
his
own
hand
and
reign
supreme
over
master
and
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
to
give
Mr.
Plomacy
his
due
,
old
as
he
be
,
he
thoroughly
understand
such
work
as
he
have
in
hand
,
and
do
it
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
order
of
the
day
be
to
be
as
follow
.
<EOS>
the
quality
,
as
the
upper
class
in
rural
district
be
designate
by
the
low
with
so
much
true
discrimination
,
be
to
eat
a
breakfast
,
and
the
non
-
quality
be
to
eat
a
dinner
.
<EOS>
two
marquee
have
be
erect
for
these
two
banquet
:
that
for
the
quality
on
the
esoteric
or
garden
side
of
a
certain
deep
ha
-
ha
;
and
that
for
the
non
-
quality
on
the
exoteric
or
paddock
side
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
both
be
of
huge
dimension
 
that
on
the
outer
side
be
,
one
may
say
,
on
an
egregious
scale
 
but
Mr.
Plomacy
declare
that
neither
would
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
to
remedy
this
,
an
auxiliary
banquet
be
prepare
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
a
subsidiary
board
be
to
be
spread
_
sub
dio
_
for
the
accommodation
of
the
low
class
of
yokel
on
the
ullathorne
property
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
who
have
not
have
a
hand
in
the
preparation
of
such
an
affair
can
understand
the
manifold
difficulty
which
Miss
Thorne
encounter
in
her
project
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
be
make
throughout
of
the
very
fine
whalebone
,
rivet
with
the
good
Yorkshire
steel
,
she
must
have
sink
under
them
.
<EOS>
have
not
Mr.
Plomacy
feel
how
much
be
justly
expect
from
a
man
who
at
one
time
carry
the
destiny
of
Europe
in
his
boot
,
he
would
have
give
way
,
and
his
mistress
,
so
deserted
,
must
have
perish
among
her
pole
and
canva
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
there
be
a
dreadful
line
to
be
draw
.
<EOS>
who
be
to
dispose
themselves
within
the
ha
-
ha
,
and
who
without
?
<EOS>
to
this
the
unthinking
will
give
an
off
-
hand
answer
,
as
they
will
to
every
ponderous
question
.
<EOS>
oh
,
the
bishop
and
such
-
like
within
the
ha
-
ha
,
and
Farmer
Greenacre
and
such
-
like
without
.
<EOS>
true
,
my
unthinking
friend
,
but
who
shall
define
these
such
-
like
?
<EOS>
It
be
in
such
definition
that
the
whole
difficulty
of
society
consist
.
<EOS>
to
seat
the
bishop
on
an
arm
-
chair
on
the
lawn
and
place
Farmer
Greenacre
at
the
end
of
a
long
table
in
the
paddock
be
easy
enough
,
but
where
will
you
put
Mrs.
Lookaloft
,
whose
husband
,
though
a
tenant
on
the
estate
,
hunt
in
a
red
coat
,
whose
daughter
go
to
a
fashionable
seminary
in
Barchester
,
who
call
her
farm
-
house
Rosebank
,
and
who
have
a
pianoforte
in
her
drawing
-
room
?
<EOS>
the
Misses
Lookaloft
,
as
they
call
themselves
,
will
not
sit
contented
among
the
bumpkin
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
will
not
squeeze
her
fine
clothe
on
a
bench
and
talk
familiarly
about
cream
and
duckling
to
good
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
<EOS>
and
yet
Mrs.
Lookaloft
be
no
fit
companion
and
never
have
be
the
associate
of
the
Thornes
and
the
Grantlys
.
<EOS>
and
if
Mrs.
Lookaloft
be
admit
within
the
sanctum
of
fashionable
life
,
if
she
be
allow
with
her
three
daughter
to
leap
the
ha
-
ha
,
why
not
the
wife
and
daughter
of
other
family
also
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenacre
be
at
present
well
contented
with
the
paddock
,
but
she
may
cease
to
be
so
if
she
see
Mrs.
Lookaloft
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
and
thus
poor
Miss
Thorne
have
a
hard
time
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
how
be
she
to
divide
her
guest
between
the
marquee
and
the
parlour
?
<EOS>
She
have
a
countess
coming
,
an
honourable
John
and
an
honourable
George
,
and
a
whole
bevy
of
Ladies
Amelia
,
Rosina
,
Margaretta
,
&
c
;
she
have
a
leash
of
baronet
with
their
baronette
;
and
,
as
we
all
know
,
she
have
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
if
she
put
them
on
the
lawn
,
no
one
would
go
into
the
parlour
;
if
she
put
them
into
the
parlour
,
no
one
would
go
into
the
tent
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
keep
the
old
people
in
the
house
and
leave
the
lawn
to
the
lover
.
<EOS>
She
may
as
well
have
seat
herself
at
once
in
a
hornet
's
nest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
know
better
than
this
.
"
<EOS>
bless
your
soul
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
will
not
be
no
old
lady
 
not
one
,
bar
yourself
and
old
Mrs.
Clantantram
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
personally
Miss
Thorne
accept
this
distinction
in
her
favour
as
a
compliment
to
her
good
sense
,
but
nevertheless
she
have
no
desire
to
be
closet
on
the
come
occasion
with
Mrs.
Clantantram
.
<EOS>
She
give
up
all
idea
of
any
arbitrary
division
of
her
guest
and
determine
if
possible
to
put
the
bishop
on
the
lawn
and
the
countess
in
the
house
,
to
sprinkle
the
baronet
,
and
thus
divide
the
attraction
.
<EOS>
what
to
do
with
the
Lookalofts
even
Mr.
Plomacy
could
not
decide
.
<EOS>
They
must
take
their
chance
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
specially
tell
in
the
invitation
that
all
the
tenant
have
be
invite
,
and
they
may
probably
have
the
good
sense
to
stay
away
if
they
object
to
mix
with
the
rest
of
the
tenantry
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Plomacy
declare
his
apprehension
that
the
honourable
Johns
and
Honourable
Georges
would
come
in
a
sort
of
amphibious
costume
,
half
-
morning
,
half
-
evening
,
satin
neck
-
handkerchief
,
frock
-
coat
,
primrose
glove
,
and
polished
boot
;
and
that
,
be
so
dressed
,
they
would
decline
ride
at
the
quintain
,
or
take
part
in
any
of
the
athletic
game
which
Miss
Thorne
have
prepare
with
so
much
fond
care
.
<EOS>
if
the
Lord
Johns
and
Lord
Georges
do
not
ride
at
the
quintain
,
Miss
Thorne
may
be
sure
that
nobody
else
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
she
in
dolorous
voice
,
all
but
overcome
by
her
care
,
"
it
be
specially
signify
that
there
be
to
be
sport
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
so
there
will
be
,
of
course
,
"
say
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
all
be
sport
with
the
young
lady
in
the
laurel
walk
.
<EOS>
Them
be
the
sport
they
care
most
about
now
-
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
if
you
get
the
young
man
at
the
quintain
,
you
will
have
all
the
young
woman
in
the
pout
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
can
not
they
look
on
as
their
great
grandmother
do
before
them
?
"
say
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
that
the
lady
be
not
content
with
look
now
-
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
man
do
they
will
do
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
have
side
-
saddle
on
the
nag
;
and
let
them
go
at
the
quintain
too
,
it
will
answer
capital
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
no
good
ground
on
which
to
defend
her
sex
of
the
present
generation
from
the
sarcasm
of
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
declare
,
in
one
of
her
warm
moment
,
"
that
now
-
a
-
day
the
gentleman
be
all
woman
,
and
the
lady
all
man
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
alter
the
debase
character
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
but
,
such
be
the
case
,
why
should
she
take
on
herself
to
cater
for
the
amusement
of
people
of
such
degrade
taste
?
<EOS>
this
question
she
ask
herself
more
than
once
,
and
she
could
only
answer
herself
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
there
be
her
own
brother
Wilfred
,
on
whose
shoulder
rest
all
the
ancient
honour
of
ullathorne
house
;
it
be
very
doubtful
whether
even
he
would
consent
to
"
go
at
the
quintain
,
"
as
Mr.
Plomacy
not
injudiciously
express
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
morning
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
ullathorne
household
be
early
on
the
move
.
<EOS>
cook
be
cook
in
the
kitchen
long
before
daylight
,
and
man
be
drag
out
table
and
hammer
red
baize
on
to
bench
at
the
early
dawn
.
<EOS>
with
what
dread
eagerness
do
Miss
Thorne
look
out
at
the
weather
as
soon
as
the
part
veil
of
night
permit
her
to
look
at
all
!
<EOS>
in
this
respect
,
at
any
rate
,
there
be
nothing
to
grieve
her
.
<EOS>
the
glass
have
be
rise
for
the
last
three
day
,
and
the
morning
break
with
that
dull
,
chill
,
steady
,
grey
haze
which
in
autumn
generally
presage
a
clear
and
dry
day
.
<EOS>
by
seven
she
be
dress
and
down
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
know
nothing
of
the
modern
luxury
of
_
déshabille
_
.
<EOS>
She
would
as
soon
have
think
of
appear
before
her
brother
without
her
stocking
as
without
her
stay
 
and
Miss
Thorne
's
stay
be
no
trifle
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
nothing
for
her
to
do
when
down
.
<EOS>
She
fidget
out
to
the
lawn
and
then
back
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
She
put
on
her
high
-
heeled
clog
and
fidget
out
into
the
paddock
.
<EOS>
then
she
go
into
the
small
home
park
where
the
quintain
be
erect
.
<EOS>
the
pole
and
cross
-
bar
and
the
swivel
and
the
target
and
the
bag
of
flour
be
all
complete
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
on
a
carpenter
's
bench
and
touch
the
target
with
her
hand
;
it
go
round
with
beautiful
ease
;
the
swivel
have
be
oil
to
perfection
.
<EOS>
She
almost
wish
to
take
old
Plomacy
at
his
word
,
to
get
on
a
side
-
saddle
and
have
a
tilt
at
it
herself
.
<EOS>
what
must
a
young
man
be
,
think
she
,
who
could
prefer
maunder
among
laurel
tree
with
a
wishy
-
washy
school
-
girl
to
such
fun
as
this
?
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
she
aloud
to
herself
,
"
one
man
can
take
a
horse
to
water
,
but
a
thousand
can
not
make
him
drink
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
not
the
spirit
to
enjoy
it
,
the
fault
shall
not
be
mine
;
"
and
so
she
return
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
little
after
eight
her
brother
come
down
,
and
they
have
a
sort
of
scrap
breakfast
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
the
tea
be
make
without
the
customary
urn
,
and
they
dispense
with
the
usual
roll
and
toast
.
<EOS>
Eggs
also
be
miss
,
for
every
egg
in
the
parish
have
be
whip
into
custard
,
bake
into
pie
,
or
boil
into
lobster
salad
.
<EOS>
the
allowance
of
fresh
butter
be
short
,
and
Mr.
Thorne
be
oblige
to
eat
the
leg
of
a
fowl
without
have
it
devil
in
the
manner
he
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
look
at
the
quintain
,
Wilfred
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
it
appear
to
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
 
ah
,
yes
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
be
so
yesterday
when
I
see
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
be
begin
to
be
rather
bore
by
his
sister
's
love
of
sport
,
and
have
especially
no
affection
for
this
quintain
post
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
just
try
it
after
breakfast
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
have
the
saddle
put
on
Mark
Antony
,
and
the
pole
be
there
all
handy
.
<EOS>
You
can
take
the
flour
bag
off
,
you
know
,
if
you
think
Mark
Antony
will
not
be
quick
enough
,
"
add
Miss
Thorne
,
see
that
her
brother

now
Mark
Antony
be
a
valuable
old
hunter
,
excellently
suit
to
Mr.
Thorne
's
usual
requirement
,
steady
indeed
at
his
fence
,
but
extremely
sure
,
very
good
in
deep
ground
,
and
safe
on
the
road

<EOS>
but
he
have
never
yet
be
ride
at

Mr.

be
not
inclined
to
put
him
to
the
trial
,
either
with

without
the
bag
of
flour

<EOS>
He
hum
and
haw

finally
declare
that

afraid
Mark

My

he

wild

at
such
a

that

"
  
<EOS>
a
rattletrap
!
<EOS>
the
quintain
that
she
have
put
up
with
so
much
anxious
care
;
the
game
that
she
have
prepare
for
the
amusement
of
the
stalwart
yeoman
of
the
country
;
the
sport
that
have
be
honour
by
the
affection
of
so
many
of
their
ancestor
!
<EOS>
It
cut
her
to
the
heart
to
hear
it
so
denominate
by
her
own
brother
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
the
two
of
them
leave
together
in
the
world
,
and
it
have
ever
be
one
of
the
rule
by
which
Miss
Thorne
have
regulate
her
conduct
through
life
to
say
nothing
that
could
provoke
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
have
to
suffer
from
his
indifference
to
time
-
honour
british
custom
,
but
she
have
always
suffer
in
silence
.
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
her
creed
that
the
head
of
the
family
should
never
be
upbraided
in
his
own
house
,
and
Miss
Thorne
have
live
up
to
her
creed
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
she
be
greatly
try
.
<EOS>
the
colour
mount
to
her
ancient
cheek
,
and
the
fire
blaze
in
her
still
bright
eye
;
but
yet
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
that
,
at
any
rate
,
to
him
nothing
more
should
be
say
about
the
quintain
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
sip
her
tea
in
silent
sorrow
and
think
with
painful
regret
of
the
glorious
day
when
her
great
ancestor
Ealfried
have
successfully
hold
Ullathorne
against
a
Norman
invader
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
spirit
now
leave
in
her
family
except
that
small
useless
spark
which
burn
in
her
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
and
she
herself
,
be
not
she
at
this
moment
intent
on
entertain
a
descendant
of
those
very
Normans
,
a
vain
proud
countess
with
a
frenchified
name
who
would
only
think
that
she
grace
Ullathorne
too
highly
by
enter
its
portal
?
<EOS>
be
it
likely
that
an
honourable
John
,
the
son
of
an
Earl
De
Courcy
,
should
ride
at
a
quintain
in
company
with
Saxon
yeoman
?
<EOS>
and
why
should
she
expect
her
brother
to
do
that
which
her
brother
's
guest
would
decline
to
do
?
  
<EOS>
some
dim
faint
idea
of
the
impracticability
of
her
own
view
flit
across
her
brain
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
necessary
that
race
doom
to
live
on
the
same
soil
should
give
way
to
each
other
and
adopt
each
other
's
pursuit
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
impossible
that
after
more
than
five
century
of
close
intercourse
,
Normans
should
remain
Normans
,
and
Saxons
,
Saxons
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
after
all
,
her
neighbour
be
wise
than
herself
.
<EOS>
such
idea
do
occasionally
present
themselves
to
Miss
Thorne
's
mind
and
make
her
sad
enough
.
<EOS>
but
it
never
occur
to
her
that
her
favourite
quintain
be
but
a
modern
copy
of
a
Norman
knight
's
amusement
,
an
adaptation
of
the
noble
tourney
to
the
taste
and
habit
of
the
Saxon
yeoman
.
<EOS>
of
this
she
be
ignorant
,
and
it
would
have
be
cruelty
to
instruct
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Thorne
see
the
tear
in
her
eye
,
he
repent
himself
of
his
contemptuous
expression
.
<EOS>
by
him
also
it
be
recognize
as
a
bind
law
that
every
whim
of
his
sister
be
to
be
respect
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
perhaps
so
firm
in
his
observance
to
her
as
she
be
in
her
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
his
intention
be
equally
good
,
and
whenever
he
find
that
he
have
forget
them
,
it
be
matter
of
grief
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Monica
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
in
the
least
mean
to
speak
ill
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
when
I
call
it
a
rattletrap
,
I
merely
mean
that
it
be
so
for
a
man
of
my
age
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
always
forget
that
I
an't
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
sure
you
be
not
an
old
man
,
Wilfred
,
"
say
she
,
accept
the
apology
in
her
heart
and
smile
at
him
with
the
tear
still
on
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
or
thirty
,
"
continue
he
,
"
I
should
like
nothing
well
than
ride
at
the
quintain
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
too
old
to
hunt
or
to
shoot
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
can
jump
over
a
ditch
and
hedge
,
I
be
sure
you
could
turn
the
quintain
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
when
I
ride
over
the
hedge
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
very
often
<EOS>
I
do
that
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
do
ride
over
the
hedge
,
there
be
not
any
bag
of
flour
come
after
me
.
<EOS>
think
how
I
would
look
take
the
countess
out
to
breakfast
with
the
back
of
my
head
all
cover
with
meal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
,
Thorne
say
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
the
allusion
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
satisfied
with
the
reflection
that
the
sport
at
Ullathorne
should
be
interfere
with
by
the
personal
attention
necessary
for
a
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
but
she
see
that
it
be
useless
for
her
to
push
the
matter
further
.
<EOS>
It
be
concede
that
Mr.
Thorne
be
to
be
spare
the
quintain
,
and
Miss
Thorne
determine
to
trust
wholly
to
a
youthful
knight
of
her
,
an
immense
favourite
,
who
,
as
she
often
declare
,
be
a
pattern
to
the
young
man
of
the
age
and
an
excellent
sample
of
an
english
yeoman
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
Farmer
Greenacre
's
eld
son
,
who
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
have
from
his
early
year
take
the
exact
measure
of
Miss
Thorne
's
foot
.
<EOS>
in
his
boyhood
he
have
never
fail
to
obtain
from
her
apple
,
pocket
-
money
,
and
forgiveness
for
his
numerous
trespass
;
and
now
in
his
early
manhood
he
get
privilege
and
immunity
which
be
equally
valuable
.
<EOS>
He
be
allow
a
day
or
two
's
shooting
in
September
;
he
school
the
squire
's
horse
;
get
slip
of
tree
out
of
the
orchard
and
root
of
flower
out
of
the
garden
;
and
have
the
fishing
of
the
little
river
altogether
in
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
He
have
undertake
to
come
mount
on
a
nag
of
his
father
's
and
show
the
way
at
the
quintain
post
.
<EOS>
whatever
young
Greenacre
do
the
other
would
do
after
him
.
<EOS>
the
juvenile
Lookalofts
may
stand
aloof
,
but
the
rest
of
the
youth
of
Ullathorne
would
be
sure
to
venture
if
Harry
Greenacre
show
the
way
.
<EOS>
and
so
Miss
Thorne
make
up
her
mind
to
dispense
with
the
noble
Johns
and
Georges
and
trust
,
as
her
ancestor
have
do
before
her
,
to
the
thew
and
sinew
of
native
ullathorne
growth
.
  
<EOS>
at
about
nine
the
low
order
begin
to
congregate
in
the
paddock
and
park
,
under
the
surveillance
of
Mr.
Plomacy
and
the
head
gardener
and
head
groom
,
who
be
swear
in
as
his
deputy
and
be
to
assist
him
in
keep
the
peace
and
promote
the
sport
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
young
inhabitant
of
the
neighbourhood
,
think
that
they
could
not
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
,
have
come
at
a
very
early
hour
,
and
the
road
between
the
house
and
the
church
have
be
throng
for
some
time
before
the
gate
be
throw
open
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
another
difficulty
of
huge
dimension
arise
,
a
difficulty
which
Mr.
Plomacy
have
indeed
foresee
and
for
which
he
be
in
some
sort
provide
.
<EOS>
some
of
those
who
wish
to
share
Miss
Thorne
's
hospitality
be
not
so
particular
as
they
should
have
be
as
to
the
preliminary
ceremony
of
an
invitation
.
<EOS>
They
doubtless
conceive
that
they
have
be
overlook
by
accident
,
and
instead
of
take
this
in
dudgeon
,
as
their
better
would
have
do
,
they
good
-
naturedly
put
up
with
the
slight
,
and
show
that
they
do
so
by
present
themselves
at
the
gate
in
their
Sunday
best
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
,
however
,
well
-
know
who
be
welcome
and
who
be
not
.
<EOS>
to
some
,
even
though
uninvited
,
he
allow
ingress
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
too
particular
,
Plomacy
,
"
his
mistress
have
say
,
"
especially
with
the
child
.
<EOS>
if
they
live
anywhere
near
,
let
them
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
act
on
this
hint
,
Mr.
Plomacy
do
let
in
many
an
eager
urchin
and
a
few
tidily
dress
girl
with
their
swain
who
in
no
way
belong
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
but
to
the
denizen
of
the
city
he
be
inexorable
.
<EOS>
many
a
Barchester
apprentice
make
his
appearance
there
that
day
and
urge
with
piteous
supplication
that
he
have
be
work
all
the
week
in
make
saddle
and
boot
for
the
use
of
Ullathorne
,
in
compounding
dose
for
the
horse
,
or
cut
up
carcass
for
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
no
such
claim
be
allow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
know
nothing
about
the
city
apprentice
;
he
be
to
admit
the
tenant
and
labourer
on
the
estate
;
Miss
Thorne
be
not
go
to
take
in
the
whole
city
of
Barchester
;
and
so
on
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
before
the
day
be
half
over
,
all
this
be
find
to
be
useless
.
<EOS>
almost
anybody
who
choose
to
come
make
his
way
into
the
park
,
and
the
care
of
the
guardian
be
transfer
to
the
table
on
which
the
banquet
be
spread
.
<EOS>
even
here
there
be
many
an
unauthorised
claimant
for
a
place
,
of
whom
it
be
impossible
to
get
quit
without
more
commotion
than
the
place
and
food
be
worth

much

be
so
great
that
it
can

be
matter
of
wonder
that

be
so
fond

It
be
difficult
to
ascertain
what
be
the

who
give
such
laborious

in

in

those
misery
which

they

under

<EOS>
Mrs.

though

Miss

be
to
a

extent
fond
of

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
the
next
comer
be
Mr.

who
be
immediately
inform
of
Mrs.

's
misfortune
and
of
her
determination
to
pay
neither
master
nor
post

boy
,
although
,
as
she
remark
,
she
intend
to
get
her
lift
home
before
she
make
know
her
mind
upon
that
matter
.
<EOS>
then
a
good
deal
of
rustling
be
hear
in
the
sort
of
lobby
that
be
use
for
the
lady
"
outside
cloak

and
the
door
have
be
throw
wide
open
,
the
servant
announce
,
not
in
the
most
confident

Mrs.

and
the
Miss
Lookalofts
,
and
Mr.
Augustus
Lookaloft
.
  
<EOS>
poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
we
mean
the
footman
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
none
better
,
that
Mrs.
Lookaloft
have
no
business
there
,
that
she
be
not
want
there
,
and
would
not
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
the
courage
to
tell
a
stout
lady
with
a
low
dress
,
short
sleeve
,
and
satin
at
eight
shilling
a
yard
that
she
have
come
to
the
wrong
tent
;
he
have
not
dare
to
hint
to
young
lady
with
white
dancing
shoe
and
long
glove
that
there
be
a
place
ready
for
them
in
the
paddock

<EOS>
and
thus
Mrs.
Lookaloft
carry
her
point
,
break
through
the
guard
,
and
make
her
way
into
the
citadel
.
<EOS>
that
she
would
have
to
pass
an
uncomfortable
time
there
<EOS>
she
have
surmise
before
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
now
could
rob
her
of
the
power
of
boasting
that
she
have
consort
on
the
lawn
with
the
squire
and
Miss
Thorne
,
with
a
countess
,
a
bishop

county
grandee
,
while
Mrs.
Greenacre
and
such

like
be
walk
about
with
the
ploughboys
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
point
gain
by
Mrs.
Lookaloft
,
and
it
may
be
fairly
expect
that
from
this
time
forward
the
tradesman
of
Barchester
would
,
with
undoubting
pen
,
address
her
husband
as
T.
Lookaloft

Esquire

<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
's
pluck
carry
her
through
everything
,
and
she
walk
triumphant
into
the
ullathorne
drawing

room
;
but
her
child
do
feel
a
little
abash
at
the
sort
of
reception
they
meet
with
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
Miss
Thorne
's
heart
to
insult
her
own
guest
,
but
neither
be
it
in
her
disposition
to
overlook
such
effrontery
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Could

up
to
welcome
his

<EOS>
let
the
fault
of
the
family
be
what
they
would
,
he
could
not
but
remember
that
their
rent
be
well
pay
;
he
be
therefore
not
willing
to
give
them
a
cold
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
a
headache
,
Mr.
Thorne
!
"
say
Mrs.
Lookaloft
.
<EOS>
"
in
fact
he
could
not

or
you
may
be
certain
on
such
a
day
he

not

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
not

Mrs.
Lookaloft

<EOS>
"
not

<EOS>
It

only
bilious
you
know

and
when
he
be
that
way
,
he
can
bear
nobody
nigh
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
fact
,
however
,
be
that
Mr.
Lookaloft
,
have
either
more
sense
or
less
courage
than
his
wife
,
have
not
choose
to
intrude
on
Miss
Thorne
's
drawing

room
,
and
as
he
could
not
very
well
have
go
among
the
plebeian
while
his
wife
be
with
the
patricians
,
he
think
it
most
expedient
to
remain
at
Rosebank

<EOS>
Mrs.

<EOS>
She
have
have
an
odious
journey
.
<EOS>
Mr.

's
civility
have
be
more
than
ordinarily
greasy

and
now
,
though
he
have
not

anything
which

notice
,
she
have
for
the
first
time

be

true
that
she
have
be
conduct
herself
in
a
way
that
justify
the
world
in

<EOS>
after
all
,
could
it
be
possible
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Arabin
be
right
,
and
that
she
be
wrong
?
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
have
also
be
watch
Mr.
Slope
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
behove
her
brother
to

if
he
mean
to
gain
the
widow
.
<EOS>
She

They

<EOS>
It

They

park

she
think
that
she
may
at
any
rate
encourage
the
yeoman
by
her
presence
,
as
she
could
not
induce
her
more
fashionable
guest
to
mix
with
them
in
their
manly
amusement
.
<EOS>
accordingly
she
once
more
betook
herself
to
the
quintain
post
.
  
<EOS>
here
to
her
great
delight
she
find
Harry
Greenacre
ready
mount
,
with
his
pole
in
his
hand
,
and
a
lot
of
comrade
stand
round
him
,
encourage
him
to
the
assault
.
<EOS>
She
stand
at
a
little
distance
and
nod
to
him
in
token
of
her
good
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
begin
,
madam
?
"
say
Harry
,
finger
his
long
staff
in
a
rather
awkward
way
,
while
his
horse
move
uneasily
beneath
him
,
not
accustom
to
a
rider
armed
with
such
a
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
Miss
Thorne
,
stand
triumphant
as
the
queen
of
beauty
on
an
invert
tub
which
some
chance
have
bring
thither
from
the
farmyard
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
go
then
,
"
say
Harry
as
he
wheel
his
horse
round
to
get
the
necessary
momentum
of
a
sharp
gallop
.
<EOS>
the
quintain
post
stand
right
before
him
,
and
the
square
board
at
which
he
be
to
tilt
be
fairly
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
if
he
hit
that
duly
in
the
middle
,
and
maintain
his
pace
as
he
do
so
,
it
be
calculate
that
he
would
be
carry
out
of
reach
of
the
flour
bag
,
which
,
suspend
at
the
other
end
of
the
cross
-
bar
on
the
post
,
would
swing
round
when
the
board
be
strike
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
calculate
that
if
the
rider
do
not
maintain
his
pace
,
he
would
get
a
blow
from
the
flour
bag
just
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
bear
about
him
the
sign
of
his
awkwardness
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
looker
-
on
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
Greenacre
do
not
object
to
be
powder
with
flour
in
the
service
of
his
mistress
and
therefore
gallantly
touch
his
steed
with
his
spur
,
have
lay
his
lance
in
rest
to
the
good
of
his
ability
.
<EOS>
but
his
ability
in
this
respect
be
not
great
,
and
his
appurtenance
probably
not
very
good
;
consequently
,
he
strike
his
horse
with
his
pole
unintentionally
on
the
side
of
the
head
as
he
start
.
<EOS>
the
animal
swerve
and
shy
and
gallop
off
wide
of
the
quintain
.
<EOS>
Harry
,
well
-
accustom
to
manage
a
horse
,
but
not
to
do
so
with
a
twelve
-
foot
rod
on
his
arm
,
lower
his
right
hand
to
the
bridle
,
and
thus
the
end
of
the
lance
come
to
the
ground
and
get
between
the
leg
of
the
steed
.
<EOS>
down
come
rider
and

<EOS>
Young
Greenacre
be
throw
some
six
foot
over
the
horse

head
,
and
poor
Miss
Thorne
almost
fall
off
her

in
a
swoon

She

Mr.

He

He

Poor

soft
feminine

into
Miss

at

have
quite
touch
that

heart

<EOS>
"
oh

Miss

as
soon
as

just
before

the

from
whence
she
could
see
all

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
thank
you
for
permit
a
creature
like

<EOS>
but
if
you
know
the
pleasure
you
give
me
,
I
be
sure
you
would
excuse
the
trouble
I
bring
with

We

Mr.
Thorne
with
a
gallant
bow
but
of
a
somewhat
less
cordial
welcome
than
that
concede
by
his
sister

<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
have
hear
perhaps
more
of
the
antecedent

his
guest
than
his

have
do

have
not

undergo
the
power

<EOS>
She
and
her

Mr.

the

always

themselves
right

find
fault
with
the
people
against
whom
they
have
sin

<EOS>
Lady
De

be
a
wise
woman
,
and
therefore
,
have
treat
Miss
Thorne
very
badly
by
stay
away
till
three
o'clock
,
she
assume
the
offensive
and
attack
Mr.
Thorne
's
road
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
,
not
less
wise
,
attack
Miss
Thorne
's
early
hour
.
<EOS>
the
art
of
do
this
be
among
the
most
precious
of
those
usually
cultivate
by

who
know
how
to

<EOS>
there
be
no
withstand

<EOS>
who
can
go
systematically
to
work

,
have
do
battle
with
the
primary
accusation
and
settle
that
,
then
bring
forward
a
countercharge
and
support
that
also

<EOS>
life
be
not
long
enough
for
such
labour
.
<EOS>
a
man
in
the
right
rely
easily
on
his
rectitude
and
therefore
go
about
unarmed
.
<EOS>
His
very
strength
be
his
weakness

<EOS>
a
man
in
the
wrong
know
that
he
must
look
to
his
weapon

his
very
weakness
be
his
strength

<EOS>
the
one
be
never
prepare
for
combat

the
other
be
always
ready

<EOS>
therefore
it
be
that
in
this
world
the
man
that
be
in
the
wrong
almost
invariably
conquer
the
man
that
be
in

invariably
despise
him

<EOS>
a
man
must
be
an
idiot

an
angel
who
,
after
the
age
of
forty
,
shall
attempt

be
just

<EOS>
many
like
the
Lady
Margaretta
have
learn
their
lesson
at
a
much
early
age
.
<EOS>
but
this
of
course
depend
on
the
school
in
which
they
have
be
teach
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Thorne
be
altogether
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
know
very
well
that
she
have
be
ill
-
treat
,
and
yet
she
find
herself
make
apology
to
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
to
do
her
ladyship
justice
,
she
receive
them
very
graciously
,
and
allow
herself
,
with
her
train
of
daughter
,
to
be
lead
towards
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
window
in
the
drawing
-
room
wide
open
for
the
countess
to
pass
through
,
but
she
see
that
there
be
a
woman
on
a
sofa
,
at
the
third
window
,
and
that
that
woman
have
,
as
it
be
,
a
following
attach
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
therefore
determine
to
investigate
the
woman
.
<EOS>
the
De
Courcy
's
be
hereditarily
shortsighted
,
and
have
be
so
for
thirty
century
at
least
.
<EOS>
so
Lady
De
Courcy
,
who
when
she
enter
the
family
have
adopt
the
family
habit
,
do
as
her
son
have
do
before
her
and
,
take
her
glass
to
investigate
the
Signora
Neroni
,
press
in
among
the
gentleman
who
surround
the
couch
,
and
bow
slightly
to
those
whom
she
choose
to
honour
by
her
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
get
to
the
window
she
have
to
pass
close
to
the
front
of
the
couch
,
and
as
she
do
so
she
stare
hard
at
the
occupant
.
<EOS>
the
occupant
,
in
return
,
stare
hard
at
the
countess
.
<EOS>
the
countess
,
who
,
since
her
countess
-
ship
commence
,
have
be
accustom
to
see
all
eye
not
royal
,
ducal
,
or
marquesal
fall
before
her
own
,
pause
as
she
go
on
,
raise
her
eyebrow
,
and
stare
even
harder
than
before
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
now
to
do
with
one
who
care
little
for
countess
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
one
may
say
,
impossible
for
mortal
man
or
woman
to
abash
Madeline
Neroni
.
<EOS>
She
open
her
large
,
bright
,
lustrous
eye
wider
and
wide
,
till
she
seem
to
be
all
eye
.
<EOS>
She
gaze
up
into
the
lady
's
face
,
not
as
though
she
do
it
with
an
effort
,
but
as
if
she
delight
in
do
it
.
<EOS>
She
use
no
glass
to
assist
her
effrontery
,
and
need
none
.
<EOS>
the
faint
possible
smile
of
derision
play
round
her
mouth
,
and
her
nostril
be
slightly
dilate
,
as
if
in
sure
anticipation
of
her
triumph
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
sure
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
De
Courcy
,
in
spite
of
her
thirty
century
and
De
Courcy
Castle
,
and
the
fact
that
Lord
De
Courcy
be
grand
master
of
the
pony
to
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
have
not
a
chance
with
her
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
little
circlet
of
gold
waver
in
the
countess
's
hand
,
then
the
hand
shake
,
then
the
circlet
fall
,
the
countess
's
head
toss
itself
into
the
air
,
and
the
countess
's
foot
shamble
out
to
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
go
so
fast
but
what
she
hear
the
signora
's
voice
,
ask
:
  
"
who
on
earth
be
that
woman
,
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ah
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
,
ha
.
<EOS>
well
,
that
be
as
good
as
a
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
good
as
a
play
to
any
there
who
have
eye
to
observe
it
and
wit
to
comment
on
what
they
observe
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Lady
De
Courcy
soon
find
a
congenial
spirit
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
there
she
encounter
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
as
Mrs.
Proudie
be
not
only
the
wife
of
a
bishop
but
be
also
the
cousin
of
an
earl
,
Lady
De
Courcy
consider
her
to
be
the
fit
companion
she
be
likely
to
meet
in
that
assemblage
.
<EOS>
They
be
accordingly
delighted
to
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
by
no
means
despise
a
countess
,
and
as
this
countess
live
in
the
county
and
within
a
sort
of
extensive
visit
distance
of
Barchester
,
she
be
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
ingratiate
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
De
Courcy
,
I
be
so
delighted

"
say
she
,
look
as
little
grim
as
it
be
in
her
nature
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
expect
to
see
you
here

<EOS>
It
be
such
a
distance

and
then

you

such
a
crowd

<EOS>
and
such
road
,
Mrs.
Proudie
!
<EOS>
I
really
wonder
how
the
people
ever
get
about

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
suppose
they
ever
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

I
really
do

I

the

Mrs.

"
<EOS>
very

She

<EOS>
"
delightful

I

<EOS>
"
oh

that
is
,
I
have
no

she
do

but
,
Mrs.

who
be
that
woman
on
the
sofa
by

window

<EOS>
just
step
this
way

you
will

and
the
countess
lead
her
to
a
spot
where
she
could
plainly
see
the
signora

well

remember
face
and
figure

<EOS>
She
do
not
however
do
so
without
be
equally
well
see
by
the

<EOS>
"
look

look

"
say
that
lady
to
Mr.
Slope
,
who
be
still
stand
near

"
see
the
high
spirituality
and
temporality
of
the
land
in
league
together

all
against
poor
me

<EOS>
I
will
wager
my
bracelet
,
Mr.
Slope
,
against
your
next
sermon
that
they
have
take
up
their
position
there
on
purpose
to
pull
me
to
piece

<EOS>
well
,
I
can
not
rush
to
the
combat
,

I
know
how
to
protect
myself
if
the
enemy
come
near
me

<EOS>
but
the
enemy
know
better
.
<EOS>
They
could
gain
nothing
by
contact
with
the
Signora
Neroni

they
could
abuse
her
as
they
please
at
a
distance
from
her
on
the
lawn

<EOS>
"
She
be

perhaps
,
Mrs.

"
  
to
this
Mrs.

nothing

<EOS>
Mrs.

look
on

lose
 
one

beyond

be
therefore
able

enjoy
the
luxury

her
eventually
well
out

<EOS>
any

indeed

he

do
so
some
ten

he
have
be
delay
in

by
the
signora

<EOS>
She
have
contrive
to
detain
him
,
to
get
him
near
to
her
sofa

and
at
last
to
make
him
seat
himself
on
a
chair
close
to
her
beautiful
arm

<EOS>
the
fish
take
the
bait
,
be
hook

<EOS>
within
that
ten
minute
he
have
hear
the
whole
of
the
signora
's
history
in
such
strain
as
she
choose
to
use
in
tell
it
.
<EOS>
He
learn
from
the
lady
's
own
lip
the
whole
of
that
mysterious
tale
to
which
the
honourable
George
have
merely
allude
.
<EOS>
He
discover
that
the
beautiful
creature
lie
before
him
have
be
more
sin
against
than
sin
.
<EOS>
She
have
own
to
him
that
she
have
be
weak
,
confide
,
and
indifferent
to
the
world
's
opinion
,
and
that
she
have
therefore
be
ill

use
,
deceive
,
and
evil
speak

<EOS>
She
have
speak
to
him
of
her
mutilated
limb
,
her
youth
destroy
in
full
bloom
,
her
beauty
rob
of
its
every
charm
,
her
life
blight

wither

as
she
do
so
a
tear
drop
from
her
eye

<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
of
these
thing

ask
for
his
sympathy

what
could
a

natured

genial

Anglo

Saxon
Squire
Thorne
do

promise

<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
do
promise
to
sympathize
;
promise
also
to
come
and
see
the
last
of
the
Neros
,
to
hear
more
of
those
fearful
roman
day
,
of
those
light
and
innocent
but
dangerous
hour
which
flit
by
so
fast
on
the
shore
of
Como
,
and
to
make
himself
the
confidant
of
the
signora
's
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
We
need
hardly
say
that
he
drop
all
idea
of
warn
his
sister
against
the
dangerous
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
mistake
 
never
so
much
mistaken
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
regard
that
Honourable
George
as
a
coarse
,
brutal
-
minded
young
man
;
now
he
be
more
convinced
than
ever
that
he
be
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
such
man
as
the
honourable
George
that
the
reputation
of
such
woman
as
Madeline
Neroni
be
imperille
and
damage
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
see
the
lady
in
her
own
house
;
he
be
fully
sure
in
his
own
mind
of
the
soundness
of
his
own
judgement
;
if
he
find
her
,
as
he
believe
he
should
do
,
an
injure
,
well
-
dispose
,
warm

hearted
woman

he
would
get
his
sister
Monica
to
invite
her
out
to
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
she
,
as
at
her
instance
he
get
up
to
leave
her
and
declare
that
he
himself
would
attend
upon
her
want
;
"
no

I
positively

<EOS>
Eleanor

and
as

her
seat
at

she
find
that
Mr.

in

of
the
chair

<EOS>
as
these

,
Mr.
Arabin
be
hang
enrapture
and
alone
over
the

and
Eleanor
from
her

could
look
through
the

<EOS>
the
Bishop

Breakfast

<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
say
grace
over
the
well

spread
board
in
the
ullathorne
dining

room
;
while
he
do
so
,
the
last
breath
be
fly
from
the
Dean
of
Barchester
as
he
lie
in
his
sick
room
in
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
when
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
raise
his
first
glass
of
champagne
to
his
lip
,
the
deanship
of
Barchester
be
a
good
thing
in
the
gift
of
the
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
before
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
have
leave
the
table
,
the
minister
of
the
day
be
make
aware
of
the
fact
at
his
country
-
seat
in
Hampshire
,
and
have
already
turn
over
in
his
mind
the
name
of
five
very
respectable
aspirant
for
the
preferment
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
present
only
necessary
to
say
that
Mr.
Slope
's
name
be
not
among
the
five
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
twas
merry
in
the
hall
when
the
beards
wag
all
,
"
and
the
clerical
beard
wag
merrily
in
the
hall
of
Ullathorne
that
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
after
the
last
cork
have
be
draw
,
the
last
speech
make
,
the
last
nut
crack
,
that
tiding
reach
and
be
whisper
about
that
the
poor
dean
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
the
happiness
of
the
clerical
beard
that
this
little
delay
take
place
,
as
otherwise
decency
would
have
forbid
them
to
wag
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
sad
man
among
them
that
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
's
beard
do
not
wag
as
it
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
there
hope
the
good
,
strive
to
think
the
good
,
about
Eleanor
;
turn
over
in
his
mind
all
the
word
he
remember
to
have
fall
from
her
about
Mr.
Slope
,
and
try
to
gather
from
them
a
conviction
unfavourable
to
his
rival
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
exactly
resolve
to
come
that
day
to
some
decisive
proof
as
to
the
widow
's
intention
,
but
he
have
mean
,
if
possible
,
to
recultivate
his
friendship
with
Eleanor
,
and
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
any
such
recultivation
must
have
end
in
a
declaration
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
pass
the
previous
night
alone
at
his
new
parsonage
,
and
it
be
the
first
night
that
he
have
so
pass
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
dull
and
sombre
enough
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
be
right
in
say
that
a
priestess
would
be
want
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
sit
there
alone
with
his
glass
before
him
,
and
then
with
his
tea
-
pot
,
think
about
Eleanor
Bold
.
<EOS>
as
be
usual
in
such
meditation
,
he
do
little
but
blame
her
;
blame
her
for
like
Mr.
Slope
,
and
blame
her
for
not
like
him
;
blame
her
for
her
cordiality
to
himself
,
and
blame
her
for
her
want
of
cordiality
;
blame
her
for
be
stubborn
,
headstrong
,
and
passionate
;
and
yet
the
more
he
think
of
her
the
high
she
rise
in
his
affection
.
<EOS>
if
only
it
should
turn
out
,
if
only
it
could
be
make
to
turn
out
,
that
she
have
defend
Mr.
Slope
,
not
from
love
,
but
on
principle
,
all
would
be
right
.
<EOS>
such
principle
in
itself
would
be
admirable
,
lovable
,
womanly
;
he
feel
that
he
could
be
pleased
to
allow
Mr.
Slope
just
so
much
favour
as
that
.
<EOS>
but
if
 
and
then
Mr.
Arabin
poke
his
fire
most
unnecessarily
,
speak
crossly
to
his
new
parlour
-
maid
who
come
in
for
the
tea
-
thing
,
and
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
determine
to
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
why
have
she
be
so
stiff
-
necked
when
ask
a
plain
question
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
have
know
in
what
light
he
regard
her
.
<EOS>
why
have
she
not
answer
a
plain
question
and
so
put
an
end
to
his
misery
?
<EOS>
then
,
instead
of
go
to
sleep
in
his
armchair
,
Mr.
Arabin
walk
about
the
room
as
though
he
have
be
possess
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
,
when
he
attend
Miss
Thorne
's
behest
,
he
be
still
in
a
somewhat
confused
state
.
<EOS>
His
first
duty
have
be
to
converse
with
Mrs.
Clantantram
,
and
that
lady
have
find
it
impossible
to
elicit
the
slight
sympathy
from
him
on
the
subject
of
her
roquelaure
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
have
ask
him
whether
Mrs.
Bold
be
come
with
the
Grantlys
,
and
the
two
name
of
Bold
and
grantly
together
have
nearly
make
him
jump
from
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
this
state
of
confused
uncertainty
,
hope
,
and
doubt
,
when
he
see
Mr.
Slope
,
with
his
most
polished
smile
,
hand
Eleanor
out
of
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
He
never
consider
whether
the
carriage
belong
to
her
or
to
Mr.
Slope
,
or
to
anyone
else
to
whom
they
may
both
be
mutually
oblige
without
any
concert
between
themselves
.
<EOS>
this
sight
in
his
present
state
of
mind
be
quite
enough
to
upset
him
and
his
resolve
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
as
noon
-
day
.
<EOS>
have
he
see
her
hand
into
a
carriage
by
Mr.
Slope
at
a
church
door
with
a
white
veil
over
her
head
,
the
truth
could
not
be
more
manifest
.
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
house
and
,
as
we
have
see
,
soon
find
himself
walk
with
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
Eleanor
come
up
,
and
then
he
have
to
leave
his
companion
and
either
go
about
alone
or
find
another
.
<EOS>
while
in
this
state
he
be
encounter
by
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
say
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
if
it
be
true
that
Mr.
Slope
and
Mrs.
Bold
come
here
together
.
<EOS>
Susan
say
she
be
almost
sure
she
see
their
face
in
the
same
carriage
as
she
get
out
of
her
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
bear
his
testimony
to
the
correctness
of
Mrs.
Grantly
be
eyesight
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
perfectly
shameful
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
;
"
or
,
I
should
rather
say
,
shameless
.
<EOS>
She
be
ask
here
as
my
guest
,
and
if
she
be
determine
to
disgrace
herself
,
she
should
have
feel
enough
not
to
do
so
before
my
immediate
friend
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
that
man
get
himself
invite
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
she
have
the
face
to
bring
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
Mr.
Arabin
could
answer
nothing
,
nor
do
he
wish
to
answer
anything
.
<EOS>
though
he
abuse
Eleanor
to
himself
,
he
do
not
choose
to
abuse
her
to
anyone
else
,
nor
be
he
well
-
pleased
to
hear
anyone
else
speak
ill
of
her
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
however
,
be
very
angry
and
do
not
spare
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
therefore
leave
him
as
soon
as
he
could
and
wander
back
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
there
long
when
the
signora
be
bring
in
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
keep
himself
out
of
temptation
,
and
merely
hover
round
her
at
a
distance
;
but
as
soon
as
Mr.
Thorne
have
leave
her
,
he
yield
himself
up
to
the
basilisk
and
allow
himself
to
be
make
prey
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
how
the
knowledge
have
be
acquire
,
but
the
signora
have
a
sort
of
instinctive
knowledge
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
an
admirer
of
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
men
hunt
fox
by
the
aid
of
dog
,
and
be
aware
that
they
do
so
by
the
strong
organ
of
smell
with
which
the
dog
be
endow
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
,
however
,
in
the
least
comprehend
how
such
a
sense
can
work
with
such
acuteness
.
<EOS>
the
organ
by
which
woman
instinctively
,
as
it
be
,
know
and
feel
how
other
woman
be
regard
by
man
,
and
how
also
man
be
regard
by
other
woman
,
be
equally
strong
,
and
equally
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
a
glance
,
a
word
,
a
motion
,
suffice
:
by
some
such
acute
exercise
of
her
feminine
sense
the
signora
be
aware
that
Mr.
Arabin
love
Eleanor
Bold
;
therefore
,
by
a
further
exercise
of
her
peculiar
feminine
propensity
,
it
be
quite
natural
for
her
to
entrap
Mr.
Arabin
into
her
net
.
  
<EOS>
the
work
be
half
-
do
before
she
come
to
Ullathorne
,
and
when
could
she
have
a
well
opportunity
of
complete
it
?
<EOS>
She
have
have
almost
enough
of
Mr.
Slope
,
though
she
could
not
quite
resist
the
fun
of
drive
a
very
sanctimonious
clergyman
to
madness
by
a
desperate
and
ruinous
passion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
have
fall
too
easily
to
give
much
pleasure
in
the
chase
.
<EOS>
His
position
as
a
man
of
wealth
may
make
his
alliance
of
value
,
but
as
a
lover
he
be
very
second
-
rate
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
that
she
regard
him
somewhat
as
a
sportsman
do
a
pheasant
.
<EOS>
the
bird
be
so
easily
shoot
that
he
would
not
be
worth
the
shooting
be
it
not
for
the
very
respectable
appearance
that
he
make
in
a
larder
.
<EOS>
the
signora
would
not
waste
much
time
in
shoot
Mr.
Thorne
,
but
still
he
be
worth
bag
for
family
use
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Arabin
be
game
of
another
sort
.
<EOS>
the
signora
be
herself
possess
of
quite
sufficient
intelligence
to
know
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
man
more
than
usually
intellectual
.
<EOS>
She
know
also
that
,
as
a
clergyman
,
he
be
of
a
much
high
stamp
than
Mr.
Slope
and
that
,
as
a
gentleman
,
he
be
better
educate
than
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
have
attempt
to
drive
Mr.
Arabin
into
ridiculous
misery
as
she
do
Mr.
Slope
,
nor
would
she
think
it
possible
to
dispose
of
him
in
ten
minute
as
she
have
do
with
Mr.
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
her
reflexion
about
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
as
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
it
can
not
be
say
that
he
reflect
at
all
about
the
signora
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
be
beautiful
,
and
he
feel
that
she
be
able
to
charm
him
.
<EOS>
He
require
charming
in
his
present
misery
,
and
therefore
he
go
and
stand
at
the
head
of
her
couch
.
<EOS>
She
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
peculiar
gift
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
nature
to
see
that
he
require
charming
,
and
it
be
her
province
to
charm
him
.
<EOS>
as
the
Eastern
idler
swallow
his
dose
of
opium
,
as
the
London
reprobate
swallow
his
dose
of
gin
,
so
with
similar
desire
and
for
similar
reason
do
Mr.
Arabin
prepare
to
swallow
the
charm
of
the
Signora
Neroni
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
an't
you
shoot
with
bow
and
arrow
,
Mr.
Arabin
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
when
they
be
nearly
alone
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
or
talk
with
young
lady
in
shady
bower
,
or
turn
your
talent
to
account
in
some
way
?
<EOS>
what
be
a
bachelor
like
you
ask
here
for
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
mean
to
earn
your
cold
chicken
and
champagne
?
<EOS>
be
I
you
,
<EOS>
I
should
be
ashamed
to
be
so
idle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
murmur
some
sort
of
answer
.
<EOS>
though
he
wish
to
be
charm
,
he
be
hardly
yet
in
a
mood
to
be
playful
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
what
ail
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
you

Miss
Thorne

me
that
her
party

give
expressly
in
your
honour

yet
you
be
the
only
dull
man
at
it

<EOS>
Your
friend
Mr.
Slope
be
with
me
a
few
minute
since
,
full
of
life
and
spirit
;
why
do
not
you
rival
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
for
so
acute
an
observer
as
Madeline
Neroni
to
see
that
she
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
and
drive
the
bolt
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
wince
visibly
before
her
attack
,
and
she
know
at
once
that
he
be
jealous
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
look
on
you
and
Mr.
Slope
as
the
very
antipode
of
man
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
in
which
you
be
not

the
reverse

even
in

He

you

He

He

He

fond

so

for
directly
different
reason

<EOS>
He
love
to

He

insipid

useful

a
comfortable

sanctimony

yours

Mr.

suffer
himself
to

up
with
it

<EOS>
"
the
heart
of
some

Mr.

he
reply
nothing

<EOS>
the

go
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
the
great
mistake
any
man
ever
make
be
to
suppose
that
the
good
thing
of
the
world
be
not
worth
the
winning
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
mistake
so
opposed
to
the
religion
which
you
preach
!
<EOS>
why
do
God
permit
his
bishop
one
after
another
to
have
their
five
thousand
and
ten
thousand
a
year
if
such
wealth
be
bad
and
not
worth
have
?
<EOS>
why
be
beautiful
thing
give
to
us
,
and
luxury
and
pleasant
enjoyment
,
if
they
be
not
intend
to
be
use
?
<EOS>
They
must
be
mean
for
someone
,
and
what
be
good
for
a
layman
surely
can
not
be
bad
for
a
clerk
.
<EOS>
You
try
to
despise
these
good
thing
,
but
you
only
try
 
you
do
not

not
I

Mr.

I

<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
look
at
her
piteously
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
as
though
he
be
be
interrogate
by
some
inner
spirit
of
his
own
,
to
whom
he
could
not
refuse
an
answer
,
and
to
whom
he
do
not
dare
to
give
a
false
reply

<EOS>
"
come
,
Mr.

he

gaze
into

there

just
so
much
so

She
expect

Messrs.

ultimately
succeed

<EOS>

wonder
at

do

<EOS>
there

what
would

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

,
rise
from

lean
over

look
through

room

to
the
place
where
Eleanor

Mr.

<EOS>
She
at
once
catch
his
glance
and
avert
her
own

<EOS>
She
be
not
pleasantly
place
in
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
do
his
good
to
attract
her
attention
,
and
she
be
strive
to
prevent

intently
fix
on

Madame
Neroni

<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
endeavour
to
take
advantage
of
her
favour
,
but
he
be
think
more
of
the
manner
in
which
he
would
by
and
by
throw
himself
at
her
foot
than
of
amuse
her
at
the
present
moment

<EOS>
"
there

say
the

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
well

I
declare
I
believe
I
be
wrong
about
you

I
believe
that
you
do
think
Mrs.
Bold
a
charming
woman
.
<EOS>
Your
look
seem
to
say
so
,
and
by
her
look
I
should
say
that
she
be
jealous
of
me
.
<EOS>
come
,
Mr.

,
confide
in
me
,
and
if
it
be
so
,
I
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
up
the
match

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
that
the
signora
be
not
very
sincere
in
her
offer
.
<EOS>
She
be
never
sincere
on
such
subject
.
<EOS>
She
never
expect
other
to
be
so
,
nor
do
she
expect
other
to
think
her
<EOS>
so

<EOS>
such
matter
be
her
plaything

her
billiard
table

her
hound

polkas

her
picnic
and
summer

day
excursion

<EOS>
She
have
little
else
to
amuse
her

and
therefore
play
at
love

making
in
all
its
form

<EOS>
She
be
now
play
at
it
with
Mr.

and
do
not
at
all
expect
the
earnestness

truth
of
his

<EOS>
"
all

this
at

Mr.

this
he
do

as
he
do
everything

with
an
air

good

humoured
pleasantry

make
it
impossible
for

to
refuse
the
proffer
seat

<EOS>
"
His
bishopric
let
another
take

say
Bertie

the

be
certainly
not

speak

the

certainly
not
a
good
opportunity
for
much
cordial
conversation
,
even
if
cordial
conversation
between
them
have
be
possible
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
the
whole
four
who
form
the
party
seem
as
though
their
tongue
be
tie
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
who
be
wide
awake
to
what
he
hope
be
his
come
opportunity
,
be
not
much
concerned
in
the
interest
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
His
wish
be
to
see
Eleanor
move
,
that
he
may
pursue
her
.
<EOS>
Bertie
be
not
exactly
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
;
the
evil
day
be
near
enough
;
there
be
no
reason
why
he
should
precipitate
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
Eleanor
Bold
if
he
could
,
and
be
resolve
to
-
day
to
take
the
first
preliminary
step
towards
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
time
enough
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
make
an
offer
of
marriage
over
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
have
thus
good
-
naturedly
make
way
for
Mr.
Arabin
,
he
be
willing
also
to
let
him
talk
to
the
future
Mrs.
Stanhope
as
long
as
they
remain
in
their
present
position
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
have
bow
to
Mr.
Slope
,
begin
eat
his
food
without
say
a
word
further
.
<EOS>
He
be
full
of
thought
,
and
though
he
eat
he
do
so
unconsciously
.
  
<EOS>
but
poor
Eleanor
be
the
most
to
be
pity
.
<EOS>
the
only
friend
on
whom
she
think
she
could
rely
be
Bertie
Stanhope
,
and
he
,
it
seem
,
be
determined
to
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
do
not
attempt
to
address
her
.
<EOS>
She
say
a
few
word
in
reply
to
some
remark
from
Mr.
Slope
and
then
,
feel
the
situation
too
much
for
her
,
start
from
her
chair
in
spite
of
Miss
Thorne
and
hurry
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
follow
her
,
and
young
Stanhope
lose
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Madeline
Neroni
,
when
she
be
leave
alone
,
could
not
help
ponder
much
on
the
singular
interview
she
have
have
with
this
singular
man
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
that
she
have
speak
to
him
have
be
intend
by
her
to
be
receive
as
true
,
and
yet
he
have
answer
her
in
the
very
spirit
of
truth
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
so
,
and
she
have
be
aware
that
he
have
so
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
worm
from
him
his
secret
,
and
he
,
debar
as
it
would
seem
from
man
's
usual
privilege
of
lying
,
have
innocently
lay
bare
his
whole
soul
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
love
Eleanor
Bold
,
but
Eleanor
be
not
in
his
eye
so
beautiful
as
herself
.
<EOS>
He
would
fain
have
Eleanor
for
his
wife
,
but
yet
he
have
acknowledge
that
she
be
the
less
gifted
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
literally
be
unable
to
falsify
his
thought
when
question
,
and
have
be
compel
to
be
true
_
malgré
lui
_
,
even
when
truth
must
have
be
so
disagreeable
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
teacher
of
man
,
this
Oxford
pundit
,
this
double
-
distil
quintessence
of
university
perfection
,
this
writer
of
religious
treatise
,
this
speaker
of
ecclesiastical
speech
,
have
be
like
a
little
child
in
her
hand
;
she
have
turn
him
inside
out
and
read
his
very
heart
as
she
may
have
do
that
of
a
young
girl
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
despise
him
for
his
facile
openness
,
and
yet
she
like
him
for
it
,
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
novelty
to
her
,
a
new
trait
in
a
man
's
character
.
<EOS>
She
feel
also
that
she
could
never
so
completely
make
a
fool
of
him
as
she
do
of
the
Slopes
and
Thornes
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
never
could
induce
Mr.
Arabin
to
make
protestation
to
her
that
be
not
true
,
or
to
listen
to
nonsense
<EOS>
that
be
mere
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
heartily
in
love
with
Mrs.
Bold
;
and
the
signora
,
with
very
unwonted
good
nature
,
begin
to
turn
it
over
in
her
mind
whether
she
could
not
do
him
a
good
turn
.
<EOS>
of
course
Bertie
be
to
have
the
first
chance
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
understand
family
arrangement
that
her
brother
be
,
if
possible
,
to
marry
the
Widow
Bold
.
<EOS>
Madeline
know
too
well
his
necessity
and
what
be
due
to
her
sister
to
interfere
with
so
excellent
a
plan
,
as
long
as
it
may
be
feasible
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
strong
suspicion
that
it
be
not
feasible
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
it
likely
that
Mrs.
Bold
would
accept
a
man
in
her
brother
's
position
,
and
she
have
frequently
say
so
to
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
She
be
inclined
to
believe
that
Mr.
Slope
have
more
chance
of
success
,
and
with
her
it
would
be
a
labour
of
love
to
rob
Mr.
Slope
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
signora
resolve
,
should
Bertie
fail
,
to
do
a
good
-
natured
act
for
once
in
her
life
and
give
up
Mr.
Arabin
to
the
woman
whom
he
love
.
   
<EOS>
the
Lookalofts
and
the
Greenacres
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
Miss
Thorne
's
provision
for
the
amusement
and
feeding
of
the
outer
class
in
the
exoteric
paddock
be
not
unsuccessful
.
  
<EOS>
two
little
drawback
to
the
general
happiness
do
take
place
,
but
they
be
of
a
temporary
nature
,
and
apparent
rather
than
real
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
the
downfall
of
young
Harry
Greenacre
,
and
the
other
the
uprise
of
Mrs.
Lookaloft
and
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
quintain
,
it
become
more
popular
among
the
boy
on
foot
than
it
would
ever
have
be
among
the
man
on
horseback
,
even
have
young
Greenacre
be
more
successful
.
<EOS>
It
be
twirl
round
and
round
till
it
be
nearly
twirl
out
of
the
ground
,
and
the
bag
of
flour
be
use
with
great
gusto
in
powder
the
back
and
head
of
all
who
could
be
coax
within
its
vicinity
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
report
all
through
the
assemblage
that
Harry
be
dead
,
and
there
be
a
pathetic
scene
between
him
and
his
mother
when
it
be
find
that
he
have
escape
scatheless
from
the
fall
.
<EOS>
a
good
deal
of
beer
be
drunk
on
the
occasion
,
and
the
quintain
be
"
dratte
"
and
"
bother
,
"
and
very
generally
anathematize
by
all
the
mother
who
have
young
son
likely
to
be
place
in
similar
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
but
the
affair
of
Mrs.
Lookaloft
be
of
a
more
serious
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
tell
"
ee
plainly
 
face
to
face
 
<EOS>
she
be
there
in
madam
's
drawing
-
room
;
herself
and
Gussy
,
and
them
two
walloping
gal
,
dress
up
to
their
very
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
by
a
very
positive
,
very
indignant
,
and
very
fat
farmer
's
wife
,
who
be
sit
on
the
end
of
a
bench
lean
on
the
handle
of
a
huge
,
cotton
umbrella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
:
you
do
not
zee
her
,
Dame
Guffern
?
<EOS>
"
say
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
whom
this
information
,
join
to
the
recent
peril
undergo
by
her
son
,
almost
overpower
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greenacre
hold
just
as
much
land
as
Mr.
Lookaloft
,
pay
his
rent
quite
as
punctually
,
and
his
opinion
in
the
vestry
room
be
reckon
to
be
every
whit
as
good
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
's
rise
in
the
world
have
be
wormwood
to
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
taste
herself
for
the
sort
of
finery
which
have
convert
Barleystubb
farm
into
Rosebank
and
which
have
occasionally
grace
Mr.
Lookaloft
's
letter
with
the
dignity
of
esquirehood
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
wish
to
convert
her
own
homestead
into
Violet
Villa
,
or
to
see
her
goodman
go
about
with
a
new
-
fangled
handle
to
his
name
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
mortal
injury
to
her
that
Mrs.
Lookaloft
should
be
successful
in
her
hunt
after
such
honour
.
<EOS>
She
have
abuse
and
ridicule
Mrs.
Lookaloft
to
the
extent
of
her
little
power
.
<EOS>
She
have
push
against
her
go
out
of
church
,
and
have
excuse
herself
with
all
the
easiness
of
equality
.
<EOS>
"
ah
,
dame
,
I
axis
pardon
,
but
you
be
grow
so
mortal
stout
these
time
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
inquire
with
apparent
cordiality
of
Mr.
Lookaloft
after
"
the
woman
that
own
him
,
"
and
have
,
as
she
think
,
be
on
the
whole
able
to
hold
her
own
pretty
well
against
her
aspire
neighbour
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
she
find
herself
distinctly
put
into
a
separate
and
inferior
class
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
be
ask
into
the
ullathorne
drawing
-
room
merely
because
she
call
her
house
Rosebank
and
have
talk
over
her
husband
into
buy
piano
and
silk
dress
instead
of
put
his
money
by
to
stock
farm
for
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
much
as
she
reverence
Miss
Thorne
,
and
highly
as
she
respect
her
husband
's
landlord
,
could
not
but
look
on
this
as
an
act
of
injustice
do
to
her
and
her
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
Lookalofts
have
never
be
recognize
as
be
of
a
different
class
from
the
Greenacres
.
<EOS>
Their
pretension
be
all
self
-
pretension
,
their
finery
be
all
pay
for
by
themselves
and
not
grant
to
them
by
other
.
<EOS>
the
local
sovereign
of
the
vicinity
,
the
district
fountain
of
honour
,
have
hitherto
confer
on
them
the
stamp
of
no
rank
.
<EOS>
hitherto
their
crinoline
petticoat
,
late
hour
,
and
mince
gait
have
be
a
fair
subject
of
Mrs.
Greenacre
's
raillery
,
and
this
raillery
have
be
a
safety
-
valve
for
her
envy
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
and
from
henceforward
,
the
case
would
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
now
the
Lookalofts
would
boast
that
their
aspiration
have
be
sanction
by
the
gentry
of
the
country
;
now
they
would
declare
with
some
show
of
truth
that
their
claim
to
peculiar
consideration
have
be
recognize
.
<EOS>
They
have
sit
as
equal
guest
in
the
presence
of
bishop
and
baronet
;
they
have
be
curtsey
to
by
Miss
Thorne
on
her
own
drawing
-
room
carpet
;
they
be
about
to
sit
down
to
table
in
company
with
a
live
countess
!
<EOS>
Bab
Lookaloft
,
as
she
have
always
be
call
by
the
young
Greenacres
in
the
day
of
their
juvenile
equality
,
may
possibly
sit
next
to
the
honourable
George
,
and
that
wretche
Gussy
may
be
permit
to
hand
a
custard
to
the
Lady
Margaretta
De
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
the
fruition
of
those
honour
,
or
such
of
them
as
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
envy
family
,
be
not
such
as
should
have
cause
much
envy
.
<EOS>
the
attention
pay
to
the
Lookalofts
by
the
De
Courcys
be
very
limited
,
and
the
amount
of
entertainment
which
they
receive
from
the
bishop
's
society
be
hardly
in
itself
a
recompense
for
the
dull
monotony
of
their
day
.
<EOS>
but
of
what
they
endure
Mrs.
Greenacre
take
no
account
;
she
think
only
of
what
she
consider
they
must
enjoy
,
and
of
the
dreadfully
exalted
tone
of
living
which
would
be
manifest
by
the
Rosebank
family
,
as
the
consequence
of
their
present
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
"
ee

"
em
there
,
dame
,
do
"
ee

"
<EOS>
em
there

your

<EOS>
"
ask
poor
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
still
hope
that
there
may
be
some
ground
for
doubt

<EOS>
"
and
how
could
I
do
that
,
unless
so

I

there
myself

ask
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I

Mrs.

It

howl
back
to

at

His
moment
of
truest
happiness

armchair
in

warm
corner
of

beautifully
clean

Twas
there
that
his

be
always
to

find
on
the
accustomed
chimney

not

permit

encourage
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
the
case
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
Mr.

could
refuse
such
a
favour
to
Mr.

do

so
Stubbs
go
off

at
the
forelock
of
his

head
of

steward
's
clemency

give
another
double
pull
at
it
in
honour
of
the
farmer

kindness

<EOS>
and
as
he
go
he
swear
within
his
grateful
heart
that
if
ever
Farmer

want
a
day

work
do
for
nothing
,
he
be
the
lad
to
do
it
for

<EOS>
which
promise
it
be
not
probable

he
would
ever
be
call
on
to
perform

<EOS>
but
Mr.
Plomacy
be
not
quite
happy
in
his
mind
,
for
he
think
of
the
unjust
steward
and
begin
to
reflect
whether
he
have
not
make
for
himself
friend
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
do
not
interfere
with
the
manner
in
which
he
perform
his
duty
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
board
;
nor
do
Mr.
Greenacre
perform
his
the
bad
at
the
top
on
account
of
the
good
wish
of
stubb
the
plasterer
.
<EOS>
moreover
the
guest
do
not
think
it
anything
amiss
when
Mr.
Plomacy
,
rise
to
say
grace
,
pray
that
God
would
make
them
all
truly
thankful
for
the
good
thing
which
Madame
Thorne
in
her
great
liberality
have
set
before
them
!
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
quality
in
the
tent
on
the
lawn
be
get
on
swimmingly
 
that
is
,
if
champagne
without
restriction
can
enable
quality
folk
to
swim

<EOS>
Sir
Harkaway
Gorse
propose
the
health
of
Miss
Thorne
,
and
liken
her
to
a
blood
race
-
horse
,
always
in
condition
and
not
to
be
tired
down
by
any
amount
of
work
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
return
thank
,
say
he
hope
his
sister
would
always
be
find
able
to
run
when
call
upon
,
and
then
give
the
health
and
prosperity
of
the
De
Courcy
family
.
<EOS>
His
sister
be
very
much
honour
by
see
so
many
of
them
at
her
poor
board
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
aware
that
important
avocation
make
the
absence
of
the
earl
necessary
.
<EOS>
as
his
duty
to
his
prince
have
call
him
from
his
family
hearth
,
he
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
could
not
venture
to
regret
that
he
do
not
see
him
at
Ullathorne
;
but
nevertheless
he
would
venture
to
say
 
that
be
,
to
express
a
wish
 
<EOS>
an
opinion
<EOS>
,
he
mean
to
say
 
<EOS>
and
so
Mr.
Thorne
become
somewhat
gravel
,
as
country
gentleman
in
similar
circumstance
usually
do
;
but
he
ultimately
sit
down
,
declare
that
he
have
much
satisfaction
in
drink
the
noble
earl
's
health
,
together
with
that
of
the
countess
,
and
all
the
family
of
De
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
honourable
George
return
thank
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
follow
him
through
the
different
period
of
his
somewhat
irregular
eloquence
.
<EOS>
those
immediately
in
his
neighbourhood
find
it
at
first
rather
difficult
to
get
him
on
his
leg
,
but
much
great
difficulty
be
soon
experience
in
induce
him
to
resume
his
seat
.
<EOS>
one
of
two
arrangement
should
certainly
be
make
in
these
day
:
either
let
all
speech
-
making
on
festive
occasion
be
utterly
taboo
and
make
as
it
be
impossible
;
or
else
let
those
who
be
to
exercise
the
privilege
be
first
subject
to
a
compete
examination
before
the
civil
-
service
examine
commissioner
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
now
,
the
honourable
george
do
but
little
honour
to
our
exertion
in
favour
of
british
education
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
dining
-
room
the
bishop
go
through
the
honour
of
the
day
with
much
more
neatness
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
He
also
drink
Miss
Thorne
's
health
,
and
do
it
in
a
manner
become
the
bench
which
he
adorn
.
<EOS>
the
party
there
be
perhaps
a
little
more
dull
,
a
shade
less
lively
than
that
in
the
tent
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
lose
in
mirth
be
fully
make
up
in
decorum
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
banquet
pass
off
at
the
various
table
with
great
éclat
and
universal
delight

Twas
thus
that
Mr.

encourage
himself
,
as
he
leave
the

in

of

He
have
not
indeed
see
in

really
intoxicate

there
have
be
a
good

drunk

have
not
hesitate
to
take
his
share
,
in
order
to
screw
himself
up
to
the
undertaking
which
he
have
in
hand
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
the
first
man
who
have
think
it
expedient
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
Bacchus
on
such
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
out
through
the
window
and
on
the
grass
before
she
perceive
that
she
be
follow
.
<EOS>
just
at
that
moment
the
guest
be
nearly
all
occupy
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
be
to
be
see
a
constant
couple
or
two
,
who
prefer
their
own
sweet
discourse
to
the
jingle
of
glass
or
the
charm
of
rhetoric
which
fall
from
the
mouth
of
the
honourable
George
and
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
but
the
ground
be
as
nearly
vacant
as
Mr.
Slope
could
wish
them
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
see
that
she
be
pursue
,
and
as
a
deer
,
when
escape
be
no
longer
possible
,
will
turn
to
bay
and
attack
the
hound
,
so
do
she
turn
upon
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
let
me
take
you
from
the
room
,
"
say
she
,
speak
with
all
the
stiffness
which
she
know
how
to
use
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
out
to
look
for
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
must
beg
of
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
to
go
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
would
not
be
thus
entreat
.
<EOS>
He
have
observe
all
day
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
not
cordial
to
him
,
and
this
have
to
a
certain
extent
oppress
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
deduce
from
this
any
assurance
that
his
aspiration
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
see
that
she
be
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
may
she
not
be
so
because
he
have
so
long
tamper
with
her
feeling
 
<EOS>
may
it
not
arise
from
his
have
,
as
he
know
be
the
case
,
cause
her
name
to
be
bruit
about
in
conjunction
with
his
own
without
have
give
her
the
opportunity
of
confess
to
the
world
that
henceforth
their
name
be
to
be
one
and
the
same
?
<EOS>
poor
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
within
him
a
certain
christian
conscience
-
stricken
feeling
of
remorse
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
have
wrong
her
by
his
tardiness
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
at
the
present
moment
imbibe
too
much
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
champagne
to
have
any
inward
misgiving
.
<EOS>
He
be
right
in
repeat
the
boast
of
Lady
Macbeth
:
he
be
not
drunk
,
but
he
be
bold
enough
for
anything
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
in
such
a
state
he
could
not
have
encounter
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
permit
me
to
attend
you
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
could
not
think
of
allow
you
to
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
must
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
Eleanor
still
very
stiffly
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
be
my
special
wish
to
be
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
time
for
let
the
great
secret
escape
him
have
already
come
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
see
that
it
must
be
now
or
never
,
and
he
be
determine
that
it
should
be
now
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
his
first
attempt
at
win
a
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
on
his
knee
,
look
unutterable
thing
with
his
eye
,
and
whisper
honey
word
before
this
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
somewhat
an
adept
at
these
thing
,
and
have
only
to
adapt
to
the
perhaps
different
taste
of
Mrs.
Bold
the
well
-
remember
rhapsody
which
have
once
so
much
gratified
Olivia
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
ask
me
to
leave
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
say
he
with
an
impassioned
look
,
impassione
and
sanctify
as
well
,
with
that
sort
of
look
which
be
not
uncommon
with
gentleman
of
Mr.
Slope
's
school
and
which
may
perhaps
be
call
the
tender
-
pious
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
ask
me
to
leave
you
till
I
have
speak
a
few
word
with
which
my
heart
be
full
 
which
I
have
come
hither
purposely
to
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
see
how
it
be
now
.
<EOS>
She
know
directly
what
it
be
she
be
about
to
go
through
,
and
very
miserable
the
knowledge
make
her
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
could
refuse
Mr.
Slope
,
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
that
,
one
may
say
.
<EOS>
but
there
would
not
be
an
end
of
it
,
as
far
as
Eleanor
be
concern
.
<EOS>
the
very
fact
of
Mr.
Slope
's
make
an
offer
to
her
would
be
a
triumph
to
the
archdeacon
and
,
in
a
great
measure
,
a
vindication
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
the
widow
could
not
bring
herself
to
endure
with
patience
the
idea
that
she
have
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
have
defend
Mr.
Slope
,
she
have
declare
herself
quite
justified
in
admit
him
among
her
acquaintance
,
have
ridicule
the
idea
of
his
consider
himself
as
more
than
an
acquaintance
,
and
have
resent
the
archdeacon
's
caution
in
her
behalf
:
now
it
be
about
to
be
prove
to
her
in
a
manner
sufficiently
disagreeable
that
the
archdeacon
have
be
right
,
and
she
herself
have
be
entirely
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
can
have
to
say
to
me
,
Mr.
Slope
,
that
you
could
not
have
say
when
we
be
sit
at
table
just
now
;
"
and
she
close
her
lip
,
and
steady
her
eyeball
,
and
look
at
him
in
a
manner
that
ought
to
have
freeze
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
gentleman
be
not
easily
frozen
when
they
be
full
of
champagne
,
and
it
would
not
at
any
time
have
be
easy
to
freeze
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
thing
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
which
a
man
can
not
well
say
before
a
crowd
;
which
perhaps
he
can
not
well
say
at
any
time
;
which
indeed
he
may
most
fervently
desire
to
get
speak
,
and
which
he
may
yet
find
it
almost
impossible
to
utter
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
thing
as
these
that
I
now
wish
to
say
to
you
;
"
and
then
the
tender
-
pious
look
be
repeat
,
with
a
little
more
emphasis
even
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
not
find
it
practicable
to
stand
stock
still
before
the
dining
-
room
window
,
there
receive
his
offer
in
full
view
of
Miss
Thorne
's
guest
.
<EOS>
She
have
therefore
in
self
-
defence
walk
on
,
and
thus
Mr.
Slope
have
gain
his
object
of
walk
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
now
offer
her
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
;
but
for
the
very
short
time
that
I
shall
remain
with
you
I
shall
prefer
walk
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
must
it
be
so
short
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
Must
it
be
 
"
  
"
yes
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
interrupt
him
,
"
as
short
as
possible
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hope
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
I
have
hope
 
"
  
"
pray
hope
nothing
,
Mr.
Slope
,
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
;
pray
do
not
;
I
do
not
know
and
nee
not
know
what
hope
you
mean
.
<EOS>
Our
acquaintance
be
very
slight
,
and
will
probably
remain
so
.
<EOS>
pray
,
pray
let
that
be
enough
;
there
be
at
any
rate
no
necessity
for
us
to
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
be
certainly
treat
Mr.
Slope
rather
cavalierly
,
and
he
feel
it
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
reject
him
before
he
have
offer
himself
,
and
inform
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
be
take
a
great
deal
too
much
on
himself
to
be
so
familiar
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
make
an
attempt
  
from
such
a
sharp
and
waspish
word
as
"
no
"
to
pluck
the
sting
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
determined
to
be
very
tender
and
very
pious
,
see
that
,
in
spite
of
all
Mrs.
Bold
have
say
to
him
,
he
have
not
yet
abandon
hope
;
but
he
be
incline
also
to
be
somewhat
angry
.
<EOS>
the
widow
be
bear
herself
,
as
he
think
,
with
too
high
a
hand
,
be
speak
of
herself
in
much
too
imperious
a
tone
.
<EOS>
She
have
clearly
no
idea
that
an
honour
be
be
confer
on
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
would
be
tender
as
long
as
he
could
,
but
he
begin
to
think
if
that
fail
it
would
not
be
amiss
if
he
also
mount
himself
for
awhile
on
his
high
horse
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
could
undoubtedly
be
very
tender
,
but
he
could
be
very
savage
also
,
and
he
know
his
own
ability
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
cruel
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
unchristian
,
too
.
<EOS>
the
bad
of
us
be
still
bidden
to
hope
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
that
you
should
pass
on
me
<EOS>
so
severe
a
sentence
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
pause
a
moment
,
during
which
the
widow
walk
steadily
on
with
measured
step
,
say
nothing
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
beautiful
woman
,
"
at
last
he
burst
forth
,
"
beautiful
woman
,
you
can
not
pretend
to
be
ignorant
that
I
adore
you
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Eleanor
,
yes
,
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
with
the
true
affection
which
man
can
bear
to
woman
.
<EOS>
next
to
my
hope
of
heaven
be
my
hope
of
possess
you
.
"
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Slope
's
memory
here
play
him
false
,
or
he
would
not
have
omit
the
deanery
.
)
<EOS>
"
how
sweet
to
walk
to
heaven
with
you
by
my
side
,
with
you
for
my
guide
,
mutual
guide
.
<EOS>
say
,
Eleanor
,
dear
Eleanor
,
shall
we
walk
that
sweet
path
together
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
no
intention
of
ever
walk
together
with
Mr.
Slope
on
any
other
path
than
that
special
one
of
Miss
Thorne
's
which
they
now
occupy
,
but
as
she
have
be
unable
to
prevent
the
expression
of
Mr.
Slope
's
wish
and
aspiration
,
she
resolve
to
hear
him
out
to
the
end
before
she
answer
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Eleanor
,
"
he
continue
,
and
it
seem
to
be
his
idea
that
as
he
have
once
find
courage
to
pronounce
her
christian
name
,
he
could
not
utter
it
often
enough
.
"
<EOS>
ah
,
Eleanor
,
will
it
not
be
sweet
,
with
the
Lord
's
assistance
,
to
travel
hand
in
hand
through
this
mortal
valley
which
His
mercy
will
make
pleasant
to
us
,
till
hereafter
we
shall
dwell
together
at
the
foot
of
His
throne
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
more
tenderly
pious
glance
than
ever
beam
from
the
lover
's
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
Eleanor
 
"
  
"
My
name
,
Mr.
Slope
,
be
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
who
,
though
determine
to
hear
out
the
tale
of
his
love
,
be
too
much
disgust
by
his
blasphemy
to
be
able
to
bear
much
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
sweetest
angel
,
be
not
so
cold
,
"
say
he
,
and
as
he
say
it
the
champagne
break
forth
,
and
he
contrive
to
pass
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
He
do
this
with
considerable
cleverness
,
for
up
to
this
point
Eleanor
have
contrive
with
tolerable
success
to
keep
her
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
They
have
get
into
a
walk
nearly
envelop
by
shrub
,
and
Mr.
Slope
therefore
no
doubt
consider
that
as
they
be
now
alone
it
be
fit
that
he
should
give
her
some
outward
demonstration
of
that
affection
of
which
he
talk
so
much
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
presume
that
the
same
stamp
of
measure
have
be
find
to
succeed
with
Olivia
Proudie
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
it
be
not
successful
with
Eleanor
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
She
spring
from
him
as
she
would
have
jump
from
an
adder
,
but
she
do
not
spring
far
 
not
,
indeed
,
beyond
arm
's
length
 
and
then
,
quick
as
thought
<EOS>
,
she
raise
her
little
hand
and
deal
him
a
box
on
the
ear
with
such
right
goodwill
that
it
sound
among
the
tree
like
a
miniature
thunderclap
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
to
be
fear
that
every
well
-
breed
reader
of
these
page
will
lay
down
the
book
with
disgust
,
feel
that
,
after
all
,
the
heroine
be
unworthy
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
hoyden
,
one
will
say
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
she
be
not
a
lady
,
another
will
exclaim
.
<EOS>
I
have
suspect
her
all
through
,
a
third
will
declare
;
she
have
no
idea
of
the
dignity
of
a
matron
,
or
of
the
peculiar
propriety
which
her
position
demand
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
she
be
romp
with
young
Stanhope
;
then
she
be
make
eye
at
Mr.
Arabin
;
anon
she
come
to
fisticuff
with
a
third
lover
 
and
all
before
she
be
yet
a
widow
of
two
year
"
stand
.
  
<EOS>
She
can
not
altogether
be
defend
,
and
yet
it
may
be
aver
that
she
be
not
a
hoyden
,
not
give
to
romp
nor
prone
to
boxing
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
wish
devoutly
that
she
have
not
strike
Mr.
Slope
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
in
do
so
she
derogate
from
her
dignity
and
commit
herself
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
educate
in
Belgravia
,
have
she
be
bring
up
by
any
sterner
mentor
than
that
fond
father
,
have
she
live
longer
under
the
rule
of
a
husband
<EOS>
,
she
may
,
perhaps
,
have
save
herself
from
this
great
fault
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
the
provocation
be
too
much
for
her
,
the
temptation
to
instant
resentment
of
the
insult
too
strong
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
keen
in
the
feeling
of
independence
,
a
feeling
dangerous
for
a
young
woman
,
but
one
in
which
her
position
peculiarly
tempt
her
to
indulge
.
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Slope
's
face
,
tint
with
a
deep
dye
than
usual
by
the
wine
he
have
drunk
,
simper
and
pucker
itself
with
pseudo
-
pity
and
tender
grimace
,
seem
specially
to
call
for
such
punishment
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
too
,
a
true
instinct
as
to
the
man
;
he
be
capable
of
rebuke
in
this
way
and
in
no
other
.
<EOS>
to
him
the
blow
from
her
little
hand
be
as
much
an
insult
as
a
blow
from
a
man
would
have
be
to
another
.
<EOS>
It
go
directly
to
his
pride
.
<EOS>
He
conceive
himself
lower
in
his
dignity
and
personally
outraged
.
<EOS>
He
could
almost
have
strike
at
her
again
in
his
rage
.
<EOS>
even
the
pain
be
a
great
annoyance
to
him
,
and
the
feeling
that
his
clerical
character
have
be
wholly
disregard
sorely
vex
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
man
:
man
who
can
endure
no
taint
on
their
personal
self
-
respect
,
even
from
a
woman
;
man
whose
body
be
to
themselves
such
sacred
temple
that
a
joke
against
them
be
desecration
,
and
a
rough
touch
downright
sacrilege
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
such
a
man
,
and
therefore
the
slap
on
the
face
that
he
get
from
Eleanor
be
,
as
far
as
he
be
concern
,
the
fit
rebuke
which
could
have
be
administer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
,
she
should
not
have
raise
her
hand
against
the
man
.
<EOS>
lady
"
hand
,
so
soft
,
so
sweet
,
so
delicious
to
the
touch
,
so
graceful
to
the
eye
,
so
gracious
in
their
gentle
doing
,
be
not
make
to
belabour
man
's
face
.
<EOS>
the
moment
the
deed
be
do
Eleanor
feel
that
she
have
sin
against
all
propriety
,
and
would
have
give
little
world
to
recall
the
blow
.
<EOS>
in
her
first
agony
of
sorrow
she
all
but
beg
the
man
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
Her
next
impulse
,
however
,
and
the
one
which
she
obey
,
be
to
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
never
will
speak
another
word
to
you
,
"
she
say
,
gasp
with
emotion
and
the
loss
of
breath
which
her
exertion
and
violent
feeling
occasion
her
,
and
so
say
she
put
foot
to
the
ground
and
run
quickly
back
along
the
path
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
shall
I
sing
the
divine
wrath
of
Mr.
Slope
,
or
how
invoke
the
tragic
muse
to
describe
the
rage
which
swell
the
celestial
bosom
of
the
bishop
's
chaplain
?
<EOS>
such
an
undertaking
by
no
means
befit
the
low
-
heeled
buskin
of
modern
fiction
.
<EOS>
the
painter
put
a
veil
over
Agamemnon
's
face
when
call
on
to
depict
the
father
's
grief
at
the
early
doom
of
his
devoted
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
god
,
when
he
resolve
to
punish
the
rebellious
wind
,
abstain
from
mouth
empty
threat
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
attempt
to
tell
with
what
mighty
surging
of
the
inner
heart
Mr.
Slope
swear
to
revenge
himself
on
the
woman
who
have
disgrace
him
,
nor
will
we
vainly
strive
to
depict
his
deep
agony
of
soul
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
however
,
alone
in
the
garden
walk
,
and
we
must
contrive
to
bring
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
willing
to
come
forth
quite
at
once
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
be
sting
with
the
weight
of
Eleanor
's
finger
,
and
he
fancy
that
everyone
who
look
at
him
would
be
able
to
see
on
his
face
the
trace
of
what
he
have
endure
.
<EOS>
He
stand
awhile
,
become
red
and
red
with
rage
.
<EOS>
He
stand
motionless
,
undecided
,
glare
with
his
eye
,
think
of
the
pain
and
penalty
of
Hades
,
and
meditate
how
he
may
best
devote
his
enemy
to
the
infernal
god
with
all
the
passion
of
his
accustomed
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
long
in
his
heart
to
be
preach
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
he
be
ordinarily
avenged
of
sin
mortal
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
Could
he
at
once
have
ascend
his
Sunday
rostrum
and
fulminate
at
her
such
denunciation
as
his
spirit
delight
in
,
his
bosom
would
have
be
greatly
ease
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
preach
to
Mr.
Thorne
's
laurel
,
or
how
preach
indeed
at
all
in
such
a
vanity
fair
as
this
now
go
on
at
Ullathorne
?
<EOS>
and
then
he
begin
to
feel
a
righteous
disgust
at
the
wickedness
of
the
doing
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
justly
chastise
for
lending
,
by
his
presence
,
a
sanction
to
such
worldly
lur
.
<EOS>
the
gaiety
of
society
,
the
mirth
of
banquet
,
the
laughter
of
the
young
,
and
the
eating
and
drinking
of
the
elder
be
,
for
awhile
,
without
excuse
in
his
sight
.
<EOS>
what
have
he
now
bring
down
upon
himself
by
sojourn
thus
in
the
tent
of
the
heathen
?
<EOS>
He
have
consort
with
idolater
round
the
altar
of
Baal
,
and
therefore
a
sore
punishment
have
come
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
think
of
the
Signora
Neroni
,
and
his
soul
within
him
be
full
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
inkling
 
a
true
inkling
 
that
he
be
a
wicked
,
sinful
man
,
but
it
lead
him
in
no
right
direction
;
he
could
admit
no
charity
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
feel
debasement
come
on
him
,
and
he
long
to
shake
it
off
,
to
rise
up
in
his
stirrup
,
to
mount
to
high
place
and
great
power
,
that
he
may
get
up
into
a
mighty
pulpit
and
preach
to
the
world
a
loud
sermon
against
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
stand
fix
to
the
gravel
for
about
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
Fortune
favour
him
so
far
that
no
pry
eye
come
to
look
upon
him
in
his
misery
.
<EOS>
then
a
shudder
pass
over
his
whole
frame
;
he
collect
himself
and
slowly
wound
his
way
round
to
the
lawn
,
advance
along
the
path
and
not
return
in
the
direction
which
Eleanor
have
take
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
the
tent
,
he
find
the
bishop
stand
there
in
conversation
with
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
come
out
to
air
himself
after
the
exertion
of
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
pleasant
 
very
pleasant
,
my
lord
,
be
it
not
?
"
say
Mr.
Slope
with
his
most
gracious
smile
,
point
to
the
tent
;
"
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
to
see
so
many
person
enjoy
themselves
so
thoroughly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
think
he
may
force
the
bishop
to
introduce
him
to
Dr.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
a
very
great
example
have
declare
and
practise
the
wisdom
of
be
everything
to
everybody
,
and
Mr.
Slope
be
desirous
of
follow
it
.
<EOS>
His
maxim
be
never
to
lose
a
chance
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
however
,
at
the
present
moment
be
not
very
anxious
to
increase
Mr.
Slope
's
circle
of
acquaintance
among
his
clerical
brother
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
own
reason
for
drop
any
marked
allusion
to
his
domestic
chaplain
,
and
he
therefore
make
his
shoulder
rather
cold
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
,
very
,
"
say
he
without
turn
round
,
or
even
deign
to
look
at
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
Dr.
Gwynne
,
I
really
think
that
you
will
find
that
the
hebdomadal
board
will
exercise
as
wide
and
as
general
an
authority
as
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
one
,
Dr.
Gwynne
 
"
  
"
Dr.
Gwynne
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
raise
his
hat
and
resolve
not
to
be
outwit
by
such
an
insignificant
little
goose
as
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
the
Master
of
Lazarus
also
raise
his
hat
and
bow
very
politely
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
more
courteous
gentleman
in
the
queen
's
dominion
than
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
"
pray
do
me
the
honour
of
introduce
me
to
Dr.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
the
opportunity
be
too
much
in
my
favour
to
be
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
My
chaplain
,
Dr.
Gwynne
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
present
chaplain
,
Mr.
Slope
.
"
<EOS>
He
certainly
make
the
introduction
as
unsatisfactory
to
the
chaplain
as
possible
,
and
by
the
use
of
the
word
"
present
"
seem
to
indicate
that
Mr.
Slope
may
probably
not
long
enjoy
the
honour
which
he
now
hold
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
care
nothing
for
this
.
<EOS>
He
understand
the
innuendo
,
and
disregard
it
.
<EOS>
It
may
probably
come
to
pass
that
he
would
be
in
a
situation
to
resign
his
chaplaincy
before
the
bishop
be
in
a
situation
to
dismiss
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
what
need
the
future
Dean
of
Barchester
care
for
the
bishop
,
or
for
the
bishop
's
wife
?
<EOS>
have
not
Mr.
Slope
,
just
as
he
be
enter
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
,
receive
an
all
-
important
note
from
Tom
Towers
of
"
the
Jupiter
"
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
that
note
this
moment
in
his
pocket
?
  
<EOS>
so
disregard
the
bishop
,
he
begin
to
open
out
a
conversation
with
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
  
<EOS>
but
suddenly
an
interruption
come
,
not
altogether
unwelcome
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
bishop
's
servant
come
up
to
his
master
's
shoulder
with
a
long
,
grave
face
and
whisper
into
the
bishop
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
John
?
"
say
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
dean
,
my
lord
;
he
be
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
no
further
desire
to
converse
with
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
and
be
very
soon
on
his
road
back
to
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
as
we
have
say
,
have
declare
her
intention
of
never
hold
further
communication
with
Mr.
Slope
,
run
hurriedly
back
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
thought
,
however
,
of
what
she
have
do
grieve
her
greatly
,
and
she
could
not
abstain
from
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
<EOS>
thus
she
play
the
second
act
in
that
day
's
melodrama
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
confide
Her
sorrow
to
Her
Friend
Miss
Stanhope
 
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Bold
come
to
the
end
of
the
walk
and
face
the
lawn
,
she
begin
to
bethink
herself
what
she
should
do
.
<EOS>
be
she
to
wait
there
till
Mr.
Slope
catch
her
,
or
be
she
to
go
in
among
the
crowd
with
tear
in
her
eye
and
passion
in
her
face
?
<EOS>
She
may
in
truth
have
stand
there
long
enough
without
any
reasonable
fear
of
further
immediate
persecution
from
Mr.
Slope
,
but
we
be
all
inclined
to
magnify
the
bugbear
which
frighten
us
.
<EOS>
in
her
present
state
of
dread
she
do
not
know
of
what
atrocity
he
may
venture
to
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
have
anyone
tell
her
a
week
ago
that
he
would
have
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
at
this
party
of
Miss
Thorne
's
,
she
would
have
be
utterly
incredulous
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
inform
that
he
would
be
see
on
the
follow
Sunday
walk
down
the
High
Street
in
a
scarlet
coat
and
top
boot
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
have
think
such
a
phenomenon
more
improbable
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
improbable
iniquity
he
have
commit
,
and
now
there
be
nothing
she
could
not
believe
of
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
it
be
quite
manifest
that
he
be
tipsy
;
in
the
next
place
it
be
to
be
take
as
prove
that
all
his
religion
be
sheer
hypocrisy
;
and
finally
the
man
be
utterly
shameless
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
stand
watch
for
the
sound
of
his
footfall
,
not
without
some
fear
that
he
may
creep
out
at
her
suddenly
from
among
the
bush
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
thus
stand
she
see
Charlotte
Stanhope
at
a
little
distance
from
her
,
walk
quickly
across
the
grass
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
handkerchief
be
in
her
hand
,
and
put
it
to
her
face
so
as
to
conceal
her
tear
,
she
run
across
the
lawn
and
join
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Charlotte
,
"
she
say
,
almost
too
much
out
of
breath
to
speak
very
plainly
;
"
I
be
so
glad
I
have
find
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
you
have
find
me
!
"
<EOS>
say
Charlotte
,
laugh
;
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
good
joke
.
<EOS>
why
Bertie
and
I
have
be
look
for
you
everywhere
.
<EOS>
He
swear
that
you
have
go
off
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
be
now
on
the
point
of
hang
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Charlotte
,
do
not
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
child
,
what
on
earth
be
the
matter
with
you
?
"
say
Miss
Stanhope
,
perceive
that
Eleanor
's
hand
tremble
on
her
own
arm
,
and
find
also
that
her
companion
be
still
half
-
choke
by
tear
.
"
<EOS>
goodness
heaven
!
<EOS>
something
have
distress
you
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
answer
her
only
by
a
sort
of
spasmodic
gurgle
in
her
throat
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
good
deal
upset
,
as
people
say
,
and
could
not
at
the
moment
collect
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
this
way
,
Mrs.
Bold
;
come
this
way
,
and
we
shall
not
be
see
.
<EOS>
what
have
happen
to
vex
you
so
?
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
Can
Bertie
do
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
only
that
horrid
man
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
what
horrid
man
?
"
ask
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
moment
in
life
in
which
both
man
and
woman
feel
themselves
imperatively
call
on
to
make
a
confidence
,
in
which
not
to
do
so
require
a
disagreeable
resolution
and
also
a
disagreeable
suspicion
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
of
both
sex
who
never
make
confidence
,
who
be
never
tempt
by
momentary
circumstance
to
disclose
their
secret
,
but
such
be
generally
dull
,
close
,
unimpassioned
spirit
,
"
gloomy
gnome
,
who
live
in
cold
dark
mine
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
of
the
gnome
about
Eleanor
,
and
she
therefore
resolve
to
tell
Charlotte
Stanhope
the
whole
story
about
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
horrid
man
;
that
Mr.
Slope
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
not
see
that
he
follow
me
out
of
the
dining
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
,
and
be
sorry
enough
,
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
be
annoy
.
<EOS>
but
you
and
Bertie
manage
it
badly
between
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
his
fault
nor
mine
either
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
dislike
the
idea
of
come
in
the
carriage
with
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
be
very
sorry
if
that
have
lead
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
have
lead
to
it

"
say
Eleanor
,
almost
cry
again
.

but
it
have
not

my
fault

<EOS>

but
what
have
he
do
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
an
abominable
,
horrid
,
hypocritical
man
,
and
it
would
serve
him
right
to
tell
the
bishop
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
believe
me
,
if
you
want
to
do
him
an
injury
,
you
have
far
better
tell
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
he
do
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ugh
!
"
exclaim
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
must
confess
he
be
not
very
nice
,
"
say
Charlotte
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nice
!
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
most
fulsome
,
fawning
,
abominable
man
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
what
business
have
he
to
come
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
that
never
give
him
the
slight
tittle
of
encouragement
 
I
that
always
hate
him
,
though
I
do
take
his
part
when
other
run
him
down

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
where
it
be
,
my
dear

<EOS>
He
have
hear
that
and
therefore
fancy
that
of
course
you
be
in
love
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
wormwood
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
fact
the
very
thing
which
all
her
friend
have
be
say
for
the
last
month
past
 
and
which
experience
now
prove
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
resolve
within
herself
that
she
would
never
again
take
any
man
's
part
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
with
all
its
villainy
and
all
its
ill
-
nature
,
may
wag
as
it
like
:
she
would
not
again
attempt
to
set
crooked
thing
straight
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
he
do
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Charlotte
,
who
be
really
rather
interested
in
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
 
he
 
he
 
"
  
"
well
 
come
,
it
can
not
have
be
anything
so
very
horrid
,
for
the
man
be
not
tipsy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
sure
he
be
"

Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
must
have
be
tipsy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
declare
I
do
not
observe
it

but
what
be
it
,
my
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
believe
I
can
hardly
tell
you
.
<EOS>
He
talk
such
horrid
stuff
that
you
never
hear
the
like
:
about
religion
,
and
heaven
,
and
love

<EOS>
oh
,
dear
 
he
be
such
a
nasty
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
imagine
the
sort
of
stuff
he
would
talk
.
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
and
then
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
 
he
take
hold
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
hold
of
you
?

<EOS>
"
yes
 
he
somehow
get
close
to
me

take
hold
of
me

"
by
the
waist
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Eleanor
shuddering
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
 
"
  
"
then
I
jump
away
from
him
,
and
give
him
a
slap
on
the
face
,
and
run
away
along
the
path
till
I
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
Charlotte
Stanhope
laugh
heartily
at
the
finale
to
the
tragedy
.
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
to
her
to
think
that
Mr.
Slope
have
have
his
ear
box
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
quite
appreciate
the
feeling
which
make
her
friend
so
unhappy
at
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
to
her
think
the
matter
have
end
happily
enough
as
regard
the
widow
,
who
indeed
be
entitle
to
some
sort
of
triumph
among
her
friend
.
<EOS>
whereas
to
Mr.
Slope
would
be
due
all
those
gibe
and
jeer
which
would
naturally
follow
such
an
affair
.
<EOS>
His
friend
would
ask
him
whether
his
ear
tingle
whenever
he
see
a
widow
,
and
he
would
be
caution
that
beautiful
thing
be
make
to
be
look
at
and
not
to
be
touch
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Charlotte
Stanhope
's
view
on
such
matter
,
but
she
do
not
at
the
present
moment
clearly
explain
them
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Her
object
be
to
endear
herself
to
her
friend
,
and
therefore
,
have
have
her
laugh
,
she
be
ready
enough
to
offer
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Could
Bertie
do
anything
?
<EOS>
Should
Bertie
speak
to
the
man
and
warn
him
that
in
future
he
must
behave
with
more
decorum
?
<EOS>
Bertie
indeed
,
she
declare
,
would
be
more
angry
than
anyone
else
when
he
hear
to
what
insult
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
have
be
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
not
tell
him
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bold
with
a
look
of
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
if
you
do
not
like
it
,
"
say
Charlotte
;
"
but
consider
everything
,
I
would
strongly
advise
it
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
a
brother
,
you
know
,
it
would
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
right
that
Mr.
Slope
should
know
that
you
have
somebody
by
you
that
will
and
can
protect
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
my
father
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
it
be
so
disagreeable
for
clergyman
to
have
to
quarrel
with
each
other
;
and
circumstance
as
your
father
be
just
at
this
moment
,
it
would
be
very
inexpedient
that
there
should
be
anything
unpleasant
between
him
and
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
surely
you
and
Bertie
be
intimate
enough
for
you
to
permit
him
to
take
your
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
be
very
anxious
that
her
brother
should
at
once
on
that
very
day
settle
matter
with
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
thing
have
now
come
to
that
point
between
him
and
his
father
,
and
between
him
and
his
creditor
,
that
he
must
either
do
so
,
or
leave
Barchester
;
either
do
that
,
or
go
back
to
his
unwashed
associate
,
dirty
lodging
,
and
poor
living
at
Carrara
.
<EOS>
unless
he
could
provide
himself
with
an
income
,
he
must
go
to
Carrara
,
or
to
 
---
.
<EOS>
His
father
the
prebendary
have
not
say
this
in
so
many
word
,
but
have
he
do
so
,
he
could
not
have
signify
it
more
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
the
case
it
be
very
necessary
that
no
more
time
should
be
lose
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
have
see
her
brother
's
apathy
,
when
he
neglect
to
follow
Mrs.
Bold
out
of
the
room
,
with
anger
which
she
could
hardly
suppress
.
<EOS>
It
be
grievous
to
think
that
Mr.
Slope
should
have
so
distance
him
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
feel
that
she
have
play
her
part
with
sufficient
skill
.
<EOS>
She
have
bring
them
together
and
induce
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
that
her
brother
be
really
relieved
from
all
trouble
and
labour
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
and
moreover
it
be
quite
plain
that
Mrs.
Bold
be
very
fond
of
Bertie
.
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
plain
enough
also
that
he
have
nothing
to
fear
from
his
rival
,
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
an
awkwardness
in
subject
Mrs.
Bold
to
a
second
offer
on
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
perhaps
to
have
put
the
matter
off
for
a
week
,
could
a
week
have
be
spare
.
<EOS>
but
circumstance
be
frequently
too
peremptory
to
be
arrange
as
we
would
wish
to
arrange
them
,
and
such
be
the
case
now
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
,
could
not
this
affair
of
Mr.
Slope
's
be
turn
to
advantage
?
<EOS>
Could
it
not
be
make
the
excuse
for
bring
Bertie
and
Mrs.
Bold
into
still
close
connexion
 
into
such
close
connexion
that
they
could
not
fail
to
throw
themselves
into
each
other
's
arm
?
<EOS>
such
be
the
game
which
Miss
Stanhope
now
at
a
moment
's
notice
resolve
to
play
.
  
<EOS>
and
very
well
she
play
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
it
be
arrange
that
Mr.
Slope
should
not
return
in
the
stanhope
"
carriage
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
Mr.
Slope
be
already
go
,
but
of
that
of
course
they
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
signora
should
be
induce
to
go
first
,
with
only
the
servant
and
her
sister
,
and
Bertie
should
take
Mr.
Slope
's
place
in
the
second
journey
.
<EOS>
Bertie
be
to
be
tell
in
confidence
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
when
the
carriage
be
go
off
with
its
first
load
,
Eleanor
be
to
be
leave
under
Bertie
's
special
protection
,
so
as
to
insure
her
from
any
further
aggression
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
while
the
carriage
be
get
ready
,
Bertie
be
to
seek
out
that
gentleman
and
make
him
understand
that
he
must
provide
himself
with
another
conveyance
back
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Their
immediate
object
should
be
to
walk
about
together
in
search
of
Bertie
.
<EOS>
Bertie
in
short
be
to
be
the
Pegasus
on
whose
wing
they
be
to
ride
out
of
their
present
dilemma
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
warmth
of
friendship
and
cordial
kindliness
in
all
this
that
be
very
soothing
to
the
widow
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
though
she
give
way
to
it
,
she
be
hardly
reconcile
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
never
occur
to
her
that
,
now
that
she
have
kill
one
dragon
,
another
be
about
to
spring
up
in
her
path
;
she
have
no
remote
idea
that
she
would
have
to
encounter
another
suitor
in
her
propose
protector
,
but
she
hardly
like
the
thought
of
put
herself
so
much
into
the
hand
of
young
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
if
she
want
protection
,
she
should
go
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
should
ask
him
to
provide
a
carriage
for
her
back
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clantantram
she
know
would
give
her
a
seat
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
should
not
throw
herself
entirely
upon
friend
whose
friendship
date
,
as
it
be
,
but
from
yesterday
.
<EOS>
but
yet
she
could
not
say
no
to
one
who
be
so
sisterly
in
her
kindness
,
so
eager
in
her
good
nature
,
so
comfortably
sympathetic
as
Charlotte
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
and
thus
she
give
way
to
all
the
proposition
make
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
They
first
go
into
the
dining
-
room
,
look
for
their
champion
,
and
from
thence
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
here
they
find
Mr.
Arabin
,
still
hang
over
the
signora
's
sofa
;
or
rather
they
find
him
sit
near
her
head
,
as
a
physician
may
have
sit
have
the
lady
be
his
patient
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
person
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
guest
be
some
in
the
tent
,
some
few
still
in
the
dining
room
,
some
at
the
bow
and
arrow
,
but
most
of
them
walk
with
Miss
Thorne
through
the
park
and
look
at
the
game
that
be
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
have
pass
,
and
be
pass
between
Mr.
Arabin
and
the
lady
,
it
be
unnecessary
to
give
in
detail
.
<EOS>
She
be
do
with
him
as
she
do
with
all
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
mission
to
make
fool
of
man
,
and
she
be
pursue
her
mission
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
She
have
almost
get
him
to
own
his
love
for
Mrs.
Bold
and
have
subsequently
almost
induce
him
to
acknowledge
a
passion
for
herself
.
<EOS>
He
,
poor
man
,
be
hardly
aware
what
he
be
do
or
say
,
hardly
conscious
whether
be
in
heaven
or
in
hell
.
<EOS>
so
little
have
he
know
of
female
attraction
of
that
peculiar
class
which
the
signora
own
,
that
he
become
affected
with
a
kind
of
temporary
delirium
when
first
subject
to
its
power
.
<EOS>
He
lose
his
head
rather
than
this
heart
,
and
topple
about
mentally
,
reel
in
his
idea
as
a
drunken
man
do
on
his
leg
.
<EOS>
She
have
whisper
to
him
word
that
really
mean
nothing
but
which
,
come
from
such
beautiful
lip
and
accompany
by
such
lustrous
glance
,
seem
to
have
a
mysterious
significance
,
which
he
feel
though
he
could
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
in
be
thus
besirene
,
Mr.
Arabin
behave
himself
very
differently
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
the
signora
have
say
truly
that
the
two
man
be
the
contrast
of
each
other
 
that
the
one
be
all
for
action
,
the
other
all
for
thought
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
when
this
lady
lay
upon
his
sense
the
overpowering
breath
of
her
charm
,
immediately
attempt
to
obtain
some
fruition
,
to
achieve
some
mighty
triumph
.
<EOS>
He
begin
by
catch
at
her
hand
and
progress
by
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
He
make
vow
of
love
and
ask
for
vow
in
return
.
<EOS>
He
promise
everlasting
devotion
,
knelt
before
her
,
and
swear
that
have
she
be
on
Mount
Ida
,
Juno
would
have
have
no
cause
to
hate
the
offspring
of
Venus
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Arabin
utter
no
oath
,
keep
his
hand
mostly
in
his
trouser
pocket
,
and
have
no
more
thought
of
kiss
Madame
Neroni
than
of
kiss
the
Countess
De
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr.
Arabin
see
Mrs.
Bold
enter
the
room
he
blush
and
rise
from
his
chair
;
then
he
sit
down
again
,
and
then
again
get
up
.
<EOS>
the
signora
see
the
blush
at
once
and
smile
at
the
poor
victim
,
but
Eleanor
be
too
much
confused
to
see
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Madeline
,
"
say
Charlotte
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
particularly
;
we
must
arrange
about
the
carriage
,
you
know
,
"
and
she
stoop
down
to
whisper
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
immediately
withdraw
to
a
little
distance
,
and
as
Charlotte
have
in
fact
much
to
explain
before
she
could
make
the
new
carriage
arrangement
intelligible
,
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
talk
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
have
a
very
pleasant
party
,
"
say
he
,
use
the
tone
he
would
have
use
<EOS>
have
he
declare
that
the
sun
be
shine
very
brightly
,
or
the
rain
fall
very
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
who
never
in
her
life
have
pass
a
more
unpleasant
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Harding
have
enjoy
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
very
much
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
who
have
not
see
her
father
since
she
part
from
him
soon
after
her
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
return
to
Barchester
to
-
night
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
believe
so
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
think
he
be
stay
at
Plumstead

"

Mr.

"
He

I

I

She

She

to
be

<EOS>
I
be
talk
to
her

<EOS>
look
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
a
considerable
pause
;
for
Charlotte
could
not
at
once
make
Madeline
understand
why
she
be
to
be
send
home
in
a
hurry
without
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
return
to
Plumstead
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
merely
ask
this
by
way
of
make
conversation
,
but
he
immediately
perceive
that
he
be
approach
dangerous
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bold
very
quietly
;
"
I
be
go
home
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ah
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
forget
that
you
have
return
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Arabin
,
find
it
impossible
to
say
anything
further
,
stand
silent
till
Charlotte
have
complete
her
plan
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
stand
equally
silent
,
intently
occupy
as
it
appear
in
the
arrangement
of
her
ring
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
these
two
people
be
thoroughly
in
love
with
each
other
;
and
though
one
be
a
middle

aged
clergyman
,
and
the
other
a
lady
at
any
rate
past
the
wishy
-
washy
bread

period
of
life

they
be
as
unable
to
tell
their
own
mind
to
each
other
as
any
Damon
and
Phillis
,
whose
united
age
would
not
make
up
that
to
which
Mr.
Arabin
have
already
attain
.
  
<EOS>
Madeline
Neroni
consent
to
her
sister
's
proposal
,
and
then
the
two
lady
again
go
off
in

of
Bertie

<EOS>
and
now
Miss
Thorne
's
guest
be
begin
to
take
their
departure
,
and
the
amusement
of
those
who
remain
be
become
slack
.
<EOS>
It
be
get
dark
,
and
lady
in
morning
costume
be
think
that
,
if
they
be
to
appear
by
candlelight
,
they
ought
to
readjust
themselves
.
<EOS>
some
young
gentleman
have
be
hear
to
talk
so
loud
that
prudent
mammas
determine
to
retire
judiciously
,
and
the
more
discreet
of
the
male
sex
,
whose

have
be
moderate

feel
that
there
be
not
much
more
left
for

<EOS>
morning
party
,
as
a
rule
,
be
failure
.
<EOS>
People
never
know
how
to
get
away
from
them
gracefully
.
<EOS>
a
picnic
on
an
island
or
a
mountain
or
in
a
wood
may
perhaps
be
permit
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
master
of
the
mountain
bind
by
courtesy
to
bid
you
stay
while
in
his
heart
he
be
long
for
your
departure
.
<EOS>
but
in
a
private
house
or
in
private
ground
a
morning
party
be
a
bore
.
<EOS>
one
be
call
on
to
eat
and
drink
at
unnatural
hour
.
<EOS>
one
be
oblige
to
give
up
the
day
,
which
be
useful
,
and
be
then
leave
without
resource
for
the
evening
,
which
be
useless
.
<EOS>
one
get
home
fag
and
_
désoeuvré
_
,
and
yet
at
an
hour
too
early
for
bed
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
comfortable
resource
leave
.
<EOS>
card
in
these
genteel
day
be
among
the
thing
taboo
,
and
a
rubber
of
whist
be
impracticable
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
begin
now
to
be
feel
.
<EOS>
some
young
people
have
come
with
some
amount
of
hope
that
they
may
get
up
a
dance
in
the
evening
,
and
be
unwilling
to
leave
till
<EOS>
all
such
hope
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
other
,
fearful
of
stay
longer
than
be
expect
,
have
order
their
carriage
early
,
and
be
do
their
good
to
go
,
solicitous
for
their
servant
and
horse
.
<EOS>
the
countess
and
her
noble
brood
be
among
the
first
to
leave
,
and
as
regard
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
George
,
it
be
certainly
time
that
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
be
in
a
great
fret
and
fume
.
<EOS>
those
horrid
road
would
,
she
be
sure
,
be
the
death
of
her
if
unhappily
she
be
catch
in
them
by
the
dark
night
.
<EOS>
the
lamp
she
be
assure
be
good
,
but
no
lamp
could
withstand
the
jolting
of
the
road
of
East
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
the
De
Courcy
property
lie
in
the
western
division
of
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
could
not
stay
when
the
countess
be
go
.
<EOS>
so
the
bishop
be
search
for
by
the
Revs
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Grey
and
Green
and
find
in
one
corner
of
the
tent
enjoy
himself
thoroughly
in
a
disquisition
on
the
hebdomadal
board
.
<EOS>
He
obey
,
however
,
the
behest
of
his
lady
without
finish
the
sentence
in
which
he
be
promise
to
Dr.
Gwynne
that
his
authority
at
Oxford
should
remain
unimpaired
,
and
the
episcopal
horse
turn
their
nose
towards
the
palatial
stable
.
<EOS>
then
the
Grantlys
go
.
<EOS>
before
they
do
so
,
Mr.
Harding
manage
to
whisper
a
word
into
his
daughter
's
ear
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
say
,
he
would
undeceive
the
Grantlys
as
to
that
foolish
rumour
about
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
"
pray
<EOS>
do
not
 
pray
wait
till
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
home
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
then
I
will
explain
to
you
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
home
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
and
dine
with
me
,
and
then
we
shall
be
so
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
promise
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
exactly
know
what
there
be
to
be
explain
,
or
why
Dr.
Grantly
's
mind
should
not
be
disabuse
of
the
mistake
into
which
he
have
fall
,
but
nevertheless
he
promise
.
<EOS>
He
owe
some
reparation
to
his
daughter
,
and
he
think
that
he
may
best
make
it
by
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
the
people
be
thin
off
by
degree
as
Charlotte
and
Eleanor
walk
about
in
quest
of
Bertie
.
<EOS>
Their
search
may
have
be
long
have
they
not
happen
to
hear
his
voice
.
<EOS>
He
be
comfortably
ensconce
in
the
ha
-
ha
,
with
his
back
to
the
sloping
side
,
smoke
a
cigar
,
and
eagerly
engage
in
conversation
with
some
youngster
from
the
further
side
of
the
county
,
whom
he
have
never
meet
before
,
who
be
also
smoke
under
Bertie
's
pupilage
and
listen
with
open
ear
to
an
account
give
by
his
companion
of
some
of
the
pastime
of
eastern
clime
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bertie
,
I
be
seek
you
everywhere
,
"
say
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
come
up
here
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
look
up
out
of
the
ha
-
ha
and
see
the
two
lady
before
him
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
nothing
for
him
but
to
obey
,
he
get
up
and
throw
away
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
of
his
acquaintance
with
her
<EOS>
he
have
like
Eleanor
Bold
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
leave
to
his
own
device
,
have
she
be
penniless
,
and
have
it
then
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
marry
her
,
he
would
most
probably
have
fall
violently
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
could
not
help
regard
her
somewhat
as
he
do
the
marble
workshop
at
Carrara
,
as
he
have
do
his
easel
and
palette
,
as
he
have
do
the
lawyer
's
chamber
in
London
 
in
fact
,
as
he
have
invariably
regard
everything
by
which
it
have
be
propose
to
him
to
obtain
the
mean
of
living
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Bold
appear
before
him
,
no
longer
as
a
beautiful
woman
,
but
as
a
new
profession
call
matrimony
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
profession
indeed
require
but
little
labour
,
and
one
in
which
an
income
be
insure
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
he
have
be
as
it
be
goad
on
to
it
;
his
sister
have
talk
to
him
of
Eleanor
,
just
as
she
have
talk
of
bust
and
portrait
.
<EOS>
Bertie
do
not
dislike
money
,
but
he
hate
the
very
thought
of
earn
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
call
away
from
his
pleasant
cigar
to
earn
it
,
by
offer
himself
as
a
husband
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
the
work
indeed
be
make
easy
enough
,
for
in
lieu
of
his
have
to
seek
the
widow
,
the
widow
have
apparently
come
to
seek
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
some
sudden
absurd
excuse
to
his
auditor
and
then
,
throw
away
his
cigar
,
climb
up
the
wall
of
the
ha
-
ha
and
join
the
lady
on
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
and
give
Mrs.
Bold
an
arm
,
"
say
Charlotte
,
"
while
I
set
you
on
a
piece
of
duty
which
,
as
a
_
preux
chevalier
_
,
you
must
immediately
perform
.
<EOS>
Your
personal
danger
will
,
I
fear
,
be
insignificant
,
as
your
antagonist
be
a
clergyman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
immediately
give
his
arm
to
Eleanor
,
walk
between
her
and
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
have
live
too
long
abroad
to
fall
into
the
Englishman
's
habit
of
offer
each
an
arm
to
two
lady
at
the
same
time
 
a
habit
,
by
the
by
,
which
foreigner
regard
as
an
approach
to
bigamy
,
or
a
sort
of
incipient
Mormonism
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
history
of
Mr.
Slope
's
misconduct
be
then
tell
to
Bertie
by
his
sister
,
Eleanor
's
ear
tingle
the
while
.
<EOS>
and
well
they
may
tingle
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
necessary
to
speak
of
the
outrage
at
all
,
why
should
it
be
speak
of
to
such
a
person
as
Mr.
Stanhope
,
and
why
in
her
own
hearing
?
<EOS>
She
know
she
be
wrong
,
and
be
unhappy
and
dispirited
,
yet
she
could
think
of
no
way
to
extricate
herself
,
no
way
to
set
herself
right
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
spare
her
as
much
as
she
possibly
could
,
speak
of
the
whole
thing
as
though
Mr.
Slope
have
take
a
glass
of
wine
too
much
,
say
that
of
course
there
would
be
nothing
more
about
it
,
but
that
step
must
be
take
to
exclude
Mr.
Slope
from
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bold
nee
be
under
no
alarm
about
that
,
"
say
Bertie
,
"
for
Mr.
Slope
have
go
this
hour
past
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
business
make
it
necessary
that
he
should
start
at
once
for
Barchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
so
tipsy
,
at
any
rate
,
but
what
he
know
his
fault
,
"
say
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
that
be
one
difficulty
over
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
leave
you
with
your
true
knight
and
get
Madeline
off
as
quickly
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
here
,
I
suppose
,
Bertie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
here
for
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
well
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
come
in
to
tea
.
<EOS>
I
shall
trust
to
you
to
bring
her
,
Bertie
,
even
by
force
if
necessary
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
Charlotte
run
off
across
the
lawn
,
leave
her
brother
alone
with
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
as
Miss
Stanhope
go
off
,
Eleanor
bethink
herself
that
,
as
Mr.
Slope
have
take
his
departure
,
there
no
longer
exist
any
necessity
for
separate
Mr.
Stanhope
from
his
sister
Madeline
,
who
so
much
need
his
aid
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
arrange
that
he
should
remain
so
as
to
preoccupy
Mr.
Slope
's
place
in
the
carriage
,
and
act
as
a
social
policeman
to
effect
the
exclusion
of
that
disagreeable
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Slope
have
effect
his
own
exclusion
,
and
there
be
no
possible
reason
now
why
Bertie
should
not
go
with
his
sister
 
<EOS>
at
least
Eleanor
see
none
,
and
she
say
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
Charlotte
have
her
own
way
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
arrange
it
,
and
there
will
be
no
end
of
confusion
if
we
make
another
change
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
always
arrange
everything
in
our
house
and
rule
us
like
a
despot
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
the
signora
?
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
the
signora
can
do
very
well
without
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
will
have
to
do
without
me
,
"
he
add
,
think
rather
of
his
study
in
Carrara
than
of
his
Barchester
hymeneal
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
be
not
go
to
leave
us
?
"
ask
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
Bertie
Stanhope
be
a
man
without
principle
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
power
of
use
active
mental
exertion
to
keep
himself
from
do
evil
.
<EOS>
evil
have
no
ugliness
in
his
eye
;
virtue
no
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
be
void
of
any
of
these
feeling
which
actuate
man
to
do
good
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
perhaps
equally
void
of
those
which
actuate
man
to
do
evil
.
<EOS>
He
get
into
debt
with
utter
recklessness
,
think
nothing
as
to
whether
the
tradesman
would
ever
be
pay
or
not
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
invent
active
scheme
of
deceit
for
the
sake
of
extract
the
good
of
other
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
give
him
credit
,
that
be
the
man
's
look
-
out
;
Bertie
Stanhope
trouble
himself
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
in
borrow
money
he
do
the
same
;
he
give
people
reference
to
"
his
governor
;
"
tell
them
that
the
"
old
chap
"
have
a
good
income
;
and
agree
to
pay
sixty
per
cent
for
the
accommodation
.
<EOS>
all
this
he
do
without
a
scruple
of
conscience
;
but
then
he
never
contrive
active
villainy
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
affair
of
his
marriage
it
have
be
represent
to
him
as
a
matter
of
duty
that
he
ought
to
put
himself
in
possession
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
hand
and
fortune
,
and
at
first
he
have
so
regard
it
.
<EOS>
about
her
he
have
think
but
little
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
customary
thing
for
man
situate
as
he
be
to
marry
for
money
,
and
there
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
what
other
around
him
do
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
consent
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
begin
to
see
the
matter
in
another
light
.
<EOS>
He
be
set
himself
down
to
catch
this
woman
,
as
a
cat
sit
to
catch
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
catch
her
,
and
swallow
her
up
,
her
and
her
child
,
and
her
house
and
land
,
in
order
that
he
may
live
on
her
instead
of
on
his
father
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
cold
,
calculate
,
cautious
cunne
about
this
quite
at
variance
with
Bertie
's
character
.
<EOS>
the
prudence
of
the
measure
be
quite
as
antagonistic
to
his
feeling
as
the
iniquity
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
should
he
be
successful
<EOS>
,
what
would
be
the
reward
?
<EOS>
have
satisfy
his
creditor
with
half
of
the
widow
's
fortune
,
he
would
be
allow
to
sit
down
quietly
at
Barchester
,
keep
economical
house
with
the
remainder
.
<EOS>
His
duty
would
be
to
rock
the
cradle
of
the
late
Mr.
Bold
's
child
,
and
his
high
excitement
a
demure
party
at
Plumstead
Rectory
,
<EOS>
should
it
ultimately
turn
out
that
the
archdeacon
would
be
sufficiently
reconcile
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
in
the
programme
to
allure
such
a
man
as
Bertie
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
Would
not
the
Carrara
workshop
,
or
whatever
worldly
career
fortune
may
have
in
store
for
him
,
would
not
almost
anything
be
well
than
this
?
<EOS>
the
lady
herself
be
undoubtedly
all
that
be
desirable
,
but
the
most
desirable
lady
become
nauseous
when
she
have
to
be
take
as
a
pill
.
<EOS>
He
be
pledge
to
his
sister
,
however
,
and
let
him
quarrel
with
whom
he
would
,
it
behove
him
not
to
quarrel
with
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
lose
to
him
,
all
would
be
lose
that
he
could
ever
hope
to
derive
henceforward
from
the
paternal
roof
-
tree
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
apparently
indifferent
to
his
weal
or
woe
,
to
his
want
or
his
warfare
.
<EOS>
His
father
's
brow
get
blacker
and
blacker
from
day
to
day
,
as
the
old
man
look
at
his
hopeless
son
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Madeline
 
poor
Madeline
,
whom
of
all
of
them
he
like
the
good
 
<EOS>
she
have
enough
to
do
to
shift
for
herself
.
<EOS>
no
;
come
what
may
,
he
must
cling
to
his
sister
and
obey
her
behest
,
let
them
be
ever
<EOS>
so
stern
 
or
at
the
very
least
seem
to
obey
them
.
<EOS>
Could
not
some
happy
deceit
bring
him
through
in
this
matter
,
so
that
he
may
save
appearance
with
his
sister
and
yet
not
betray
the
widow
to
her
ruin
?
<EOS>
what
if
he
make
a
confederate
of
Eleanor
?
<EOS>
"
Twas
in
this
spirit
that
Bertie
Stanhope
set
about
his
wooing
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
go
to
leave
Barchester
?
"
ask
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
he
reply
;
"
I
hardly
know
yet
what
I
be
go
to
do
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
at
any
rate
certain
that
I
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
about
your
profession
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
about
my
profession
,
if
you
can
call
it
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
it
not
one
?
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
be
I
a
man
<EOS>
,
I
know
none
I
should
prefer
to
it
,
except
paint
.
<EOS>
and
I
believe
the
one
be
as
much
in
your
power
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
just
about
equally
so
,
"
say
Bertie
with
a
little
touch
of
inward
satire
direct
at
himself
.
<EOS>
He
know
in
his
heart
that
he
would
never
make
a
penny
by
either
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
wonder
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
why
you
do
not
exert
yourself
more
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
who
feel
a
friendly
fondness
for
the
man
with
whom
she
be
walk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
be
very
impertinent
in
me
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impertinent
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
so
,
but
much
too
kind
.
<EOS>
It
be
much
too
kind
in
you
to
take
any
interest
in
so
idle
a
scamp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
a
scamp
,
though
you
be
perhaps
idle
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
take
an
interest
in
you
,
a
very
great
interest
,
"
she
add
in
a
voice
which
almost
make
him
resolve
to
change
his
mind
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
call
you
idle
,
I
know
you
be
only
so
for
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
why
can
not
you
settle
steadily
to
work
here
in
Barchester
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
make
bust
of
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
chapter
?
<EOS>
or
perhaps
,
if
I
achieve
a
great
success
,
obtain
a
commission
to
put
up
an
elaborate
tombstone
over
a
prebendary
's
widow
,
a
dead
lady
with
a
grecian
nose
,
a
bandeau
,
and
an
intricate
lace
veil
;
lying
of
course
on
a
marble
sofa
from
among
the
leg
of
which
death
will
be
creep
out
and
poke
at
his
victim
with
a
small
toasting
-
fork
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
laugh
,
but
<EOS>
yet
she
think
that
if
the
survive
prebendary
pay
the
bill
,
the
object
of
the
artist
as
a
professional
man
would
in
a
great
measure
be
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
the
dean
and
chapter
and
the
prebendary
's
widow
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
must
take
them
as
they
come
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
of
your
have
a
great
cathedral
in
which
such
ornament
be
require
could
not
but
be
in
your
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
real
artist
could
descend
to
the
ornamentation
of
a
cathedral
,
"
say
Bertie
,
who
have
his
idea
of
the
high
ecstatic
ambition
of
art
,
as
indeed
all
artist
have
who
be
not
in
receipt
of
a
good
income

<EOS>
"
building
should
be
fit
to
grace
the
sculpture

not
the

to

the
building

"
  
"
yes
,
when
the
work
of
art
be
good
enough
to
merit
it
.
<EOS>
do
you
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
do
something
sufficiently
excellent
and
we
lady
of
Barchester
will
erect
for
it
a
fitting
receptacle
.
<EOS>
come
,
what
shall
the
subject
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
you
in
your
pony
chair
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
as
Dannecker

Ariadne
on
her

<EOS>

My

too
tame

I
fear

your

significantly

up

in

come
exactly
to
the
spot
in

Eleanor

Mr.
Slope

<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
this

unpropitious
to

<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
she
should
here
have
to
encounter
yet
another
amorous
swain

<EOS>

if
you
will
be
guide

Mr.

you
will

yourself
down

yes

in
his
demeanour
an
earnestness
very
unusual

him

You
be
kind
enough

upon
my
word

and
he
pause
awhile

hardly
know
how
to
introduce
the
subject
that
he
have
in

it
be
no
wonder
that
he
find
it
difficult

He
have
to
make
known
to
his
companion
the
scheme
that
have
be
prepare
to
rob
her
of
her
wealth

he
have
to
tell
her
that
he
have
intend

marry
her
without
love
her

or
else
that
he
love
her
without
intend

her

he
have
also
to
bespeak
from
her
not
only
his
own
pardon
,
but
also
that
of
his
sister
,
and
induce
Mrs.
Bold
to
protest
in
her
future
communion
with
Charlotte
that
an
offer
have
be
duly
make
to
her
and
duly
reject

<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
be
not
prone
to
be
very
diffident
of
his
own
conversational
power
,
but
it
do
seem
to
him
that
he
be
about
to
tax
them
almost
too
far
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
where
to
begin
,
and
he
hardly
know
where
he
should
end

by
this
time
Eleanor
be
again
walk
on
slowly
by
his
side
,
not
take
his
arm
as
she
have
heretofore
do

listen
very
intently
for
whatever
Bertie
may
have
to
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
be

me
right

listen
to

how
well

<EOS>
Eleanor
now
make
no
answer
,
but
she
feel
the
blood
tingle
in
her
cheek
as
she
gather
from
what
he
say
the
probable
result
of
this
double
-
barrelled
love
on
the
part
of
Miss
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
her
only
brother

Mrs.

on

You
can
not

have
observe
all
this

<EOS>
Eleanor
have
indeed
observe
a
good
deal
of
this
;
she
do
not
,
however
,
now
say
so
,
but
allow
him
to
proceed
with
his
story

<EOS>

You
can
not
therefore
be
surprised

Charlotte
should
be
most
anxious

do
the
good
for
us
all

Eleanor
say
that

be
not

all
surprised

and
she
have
have
a
very
difficult
game
to
play

Mrs.
Bold
 
a
very
difficult
game

Poor
Madeline

unfortunate
marriage

terrible
accident

my

ill

health

my

absence

last

bad
perhaps
,
my
own
roving

idle
spirit
have
almost
be
too
much
for
her

<EOS>
You
can
not
wonder
if
among
all
her
care
one
of
the
foremost
be
to
see
me
settle
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
on
this
occasion
express
no
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
suppose
that
a
formal
offer
be
to
be
make
and
could
not
but
think
that
so
singular
<EOS>
an
exordium
be
never

similar
position

Mr.

annoy
her

the
excess
of

ardour

quite
clear
that

about

take
the
precaution

explain
all
this
before

Twas
thus

we
may

that
the
matter
present
itself
to
Mrs.

when
he
have
get
so
far

He
still
keep
move
on

very
slowly

move
slowly
by

not

task
the
performance

which
appear
to

difficult

Mr.
Stanhope

than
the
one
I
propose
to
you
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
somewhat
lackadaisically
;
"
I
suppose
that
would
be
the
good
,
but
Charlotte
think
another
plan
may
be
join
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
want
me
to
marry
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
thousand
remembrance
flash
across
Eleanor
's
mind
all
in
a
moment
 
<EOS>
how
Charlotte
have
talk
about
and
praise
her
brother
,
how
she
have
continually
contrive
to
throw
the
two
of
them
together
,
how
she
have
encourage
all
manner
of
little
intimacy
,
how
she
have
with
singular
cordiality
persist
in
treat
Eleanor
as
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
all
this
have
be
do
to
secure
her
comfortable
income
for
the
benefit
of
one
of
the
family
!
  
<EOS>
such
a
feeling
as
this
be
very
bitter
when
it
first
impress
itself
on
a
young
mind
.
<EOS>
to
the
old
,
such
plot
and
plan
,
such
matured
scheme
for
obtain
the
good
of
this
world
without
the
trouble
of
earn
them
,
such
long
-
head
attempt
to
convert
"
tuum
"
into
"
meum
"
be
the
way
of
life
to
which
they
be
accustomed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tis
thus
that
many
live
,
and
it
therefore
behove
all
those
who
be
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
to
be
on
their
guard
against
those
who
be
not
.
<EOS>
with
them
it
be
the
success
that
disgust
,
not
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
but
Eleanor
have
not
yet
learn
to
look
on
her
money
as
a
source
of
danger
;
she
have
not
begin
to
regard
herself
as
fair
game
to
be
hunt
down
by
hungry
gentleman
.
<EOS>
She
have
enjoy
the
society
of
the
Stanhopes
,
she
have
greatly
like
the
cordiality
of
Charlotte
,
and
have
be
happy
in
her
new
friend
.
<EOS>
now
she
see
the
cause
of
all
this
kindness
,
and
her
mind
be
open
to
a
new
phase
of
human
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Stanhope
,
"
say
she
haughtily
,
"
have
be
contrive
for
me
a
great
deal
of
honour
,
but
she
may
have
save
herself
the
trouble

<EOS>
I
be
not
sufficiently
ambitious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
be
angry
with
her

Mrs.
Bold

"

he
,

with

either

<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not

"
<EOS>
no

and
why
,
may
I
ask
you
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
have
you
tell
me
this
singular
story
?
<EOS>
for
I
may
presume
I
may
judge
by
your
manner
of
tell
it
that
 
that
 
that
you
and
your
sister
be
not
exactly
of
one
mind
on
the
subject

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
we
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
so
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bold
,
who
be
now
really
angry
with
the
unnecessary
insult
which
she
think
have
be
offer
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
why
have
it
be
worth
your
while
to
tell
me
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
once
think
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
that
you
 
that
you
 
"
  
<EOS>
the
widow
now
again
become
entirely
impassive
,
and
would
not
lend
the
slight
assistance
to
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
once
think
that
you
perhaps
may
 
may
have
be
teach
to
regard
me
as
more
than
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
never
!
"
say
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
never
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
ever
allow
myself
to
do
anything
to
encourage
such
an
idea
,
I
have
be
very
much
to
blame
 
very
much
to
blame
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
have
,
"
say
Bertie
,
who
really
have
a
good
-
natured
anxiety
to
make
what
he
say
as
little
unpleasant
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
have
,
and
I
have
see
for
some
time
that
I
have
no
chance
 
<EOS>
but
my
sister
's
hope
run
higher
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
mistake
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
though
perhaps
she
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
have
you
say
all
this
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
must
not
anger
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
not
this
anger
her
?
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
I
do
not
understand
the
policy
of
your
family
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
wish
I
be
at
home
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
she
express
the
wish
she
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
and
burst
out
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Bertie
be
greatly
move
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
the
carriage
to
yourself
go
home
,
"
say
he
;
"
at
least
you
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
can
walk
,
or
for
the
matter
of
that
it
do
not
much
signify
what
I
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
perfectly
understand
that
part
of
Eleanor
's
grief
arise
from
the
apparent
necessity
of
her
go
back
to
Barchester
in
the
carriage
with
her
second
suitor
.
  
<EOS>
this
somewhat
mollify
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
"
say
she
,
"
why
should
you
have
make
me
so
miserable
?
<EOS>
what
will
you
have
gain
by
tell
me
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
even
yet
explain
to
her
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
proposition
;
he
have
not
tell
her
that
she
be
to
be
a
party
to
the
little
deception
which
he
intend
to
play
off
upon
his
sister
.
<EOS>
this
suggestion
have
still
to
be
make
,
and
as
it
be
absolutely
necessary
,
he
proceed
to
make
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
need
not
follow
him
through
the
whole
of
his
statement
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
and
not
without
considerable
difficulty
,
he
make
Eleanor
understand
why
he
have
let
her
into
his
confidence
,
see
that
he
no
longer
intend
her
the
honour
of
a
formal
offer
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
make
her
comprehend
the
part
which
she
be
destine
to
play
in
this
little
family
comedy
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
she
do
understand
it
,
she
be
only
more
angry
with
him
than
ever
;
more
angry
,
not
only
with
him
,
but
with
Charlotte
also
.
<EOS>
Her
fair
name
be
to
be
bandy
about
between
them
in
different
sense
,
and
each
sense
false
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
be
play
off
by
the
sister
against
the
father
,
and
then
by
the
brother
against
the
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
dear
friend
Charlotte
,
with
all
her
agreeable
sympathy
and
affection
,
be
strive
to
sacrifice
her
for
the
Stanhope
family
welfare
;
and
Bertie
,
who
,
as
he
now
proclaim
himself
,
be
over
head
and
ear
in
debt
,
complete
the
compliment
of
owning
that
he
do
not
care
to
have
his
debt
pay
at
so
great
a
sacrifice
of
himself
.
<EOS>
then
she
be
ask
to
conspire
together
with
this
unwilling
suitor
for
the
sake
of
make
the
family
believe
that
he
have
in
obedience
to
their
command
do
his
good
to
throw
himself
thus
away
!
  
<EOS>
She
lift
up
her
face
when
he
have
finish
,
and
look
at
him
with
much
dignity
,
even
through
her
tear
,
she
say
:
  
"
I
regret
to
say
it
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
but
after
what
have
pass
I
believe
that
all
intercourse
between
your
family
and
myself
have
well
cease
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
perhaps
it
have
,
"
say
Bertie
naïvely
;
"
perhaps
that
will
be
well
at
any
rate
for
a
time
;
and
then
Charlotte
will
think
you
be
offend
at
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
I
will
go
back
to
the
house
,
if
you
please
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
find
my
way
by
myself
,
Mr.
Stanhope
:
after
what
have
pass
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
would
rather
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
must
find
the
carriage
for
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
;
and
I
must
tell
my
father
that
you
will
return
with
him
alone
;
and
I
must
make
some
excuse
to
him
for
not
go
with
you
;
and
I
must
bid
the
servant
put
you
down
at
your
own
house
,
for
I
suppose
you
will
not
now
choose
to
see
them
again
in
the
close
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
truth
about
this
,
and
a
perspicuity
in
make
arrangement
for
lessen
her
immediate
embarrassment
,
which
have
some
effect
in
soften
Eleanor
's
anger
.
<EOS>
so
she
suffer
herself
to
walk
by
his
side
over
the
now
desert
lawn
,
till
they
come
to
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
about
Bertie
Stanhope
which
give
him
,
in
the
estimation
of
everyone
,
a
different
standing
from
that
which
any
other
man
would
occupy
under
similar
circumstance
.
<EOS>
angry
as
Eleanor
be
,
and
great
as
be
her
cause
for
anger
,
she
be
not
half
as
angry
with
him
as
she
would
have
be
with
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
He
be
apparently
so
simple
,
so
good
-
natured
,
so
unaffected
and
easy
to
talk
to
,
<EOS>
that
she
have
already
half
-
forgive
him
before
he
be
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
there
,
Dr.
Stanhope
be
sit
nearly
alone
with
Mr.

Miss
Thorne
;
one
or
two
other
unfortunate

there
,
who
from
one
cause
or
another
be
still
delay
in
get
away
,
but
they
be
every
moment
get
few
in
number
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
hand
Eleanor
over
to
his
father
,
Bertie
start
off
to
the
front
gate
in
search
of
the
carriage
,
and
there
he
wait
lean
patiently
against
the
front
wall
,
comfortably
smoke
a
cigar
,
till
it
come
up
.
<EOS>
when
he
return
to
the
room
,
Dr.
Stanhope
and
Eleanor
be
alone
with
their
host
.
  
<EOS>
"
at

he
cheerily
,
"
I

<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
declare
that
she
be
delighted
to
have
Mrs.
Bold
and
Dr.
Stanhope
still
with
her
,
and
Mr.
Thorne
would
have

,
have
he
not

by
a
yawn

which
he
could
not

"
Father

"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor

,
see
him
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
bow
to
her
with
his
usual
gay
smile
,
as
though
nothing

the
tranquillity
of

<EOS>
It

take

hand
between
the
fold

her
capacious
apron
so

to
save

from
the

the

in
this
guise
she
bring
them
to
her

They

they
exchange
letter

"
such
be
Mrs.
Quiverful
's
verdict
about
Mrs.
Proudie
,
to
which
in
after

she
always
adhere
.
<EOS>
People
when
they
get
their

double
usually
think
that
those
through

this

<EOS>
"

Mrs.

then
the
two

unmindful
of
the
kitchen
apron
,
the
greasy
finger
,
and
the
adherent
irish
stew

throw
themselves
warmly
into

<EOS>
"
for

I

I

Mr.

solemnly

<EOS>
and
who
that
consider
the
weight

the
burden
on
this
man

fourteen

Mrs.

have
so
powerfully

<EOS>
as
long
as
promotion
cometh
from
any
human
source

whether

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
till
we

we

in

<EOS>
and
then
the

sit
down
lovingly
together

talk
over
all

there

<EOS>
with
him

at
any

let
us
say
that
that

<EOS>
in
the
morning
Q.

keep
their
appointment
with
that
punctuality
which
bespeak
an
expectant

<EOS>
the
friendly
farmer

gig
be
borrow

and
in
that
they
go
,
discuss
many
thing
by
the
way

<EOS>
They
have
instruct
the
household
to
expect
them
back
by
one

and
injunction
be
give
to
the

pledge

have
ready
by

accustomed
hour
the
remainder
of
the
huge

the

<EOS>
with

palpitate
heart
be
the

wanderer
greet

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
child

you
all
think
we
be
never
come
back
any
more

"
say
the

as
she
slowly
let
down
her
solid
foot
till
it
rest
on
the
step
of
the
gig
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
such
a
day
as
we
have
have
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
lean
heavily
on
a
big
boy
's
shoulder
,
she
step
once
more
on
terra
firma
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
for
more
than
the
tone
of
her
voice
to
tell
them
that
all
be
right
.
<EOS>
the
irish
stew
may
burn
itself
to
cinder
now
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
such
kissing
and
hugging
,
such
crying
and
laughing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
could
not
sit
still
at
all
,
but
keep
walk
from
room
to
room
,
then
out
into
the
garden
,
then
down
the
avenue
into
the
road
,
and
then
back
again
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
lose
no
time
so
idly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
to
work
at
once
,
girl
,
and
that
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
expect
us
to
be
in
the
hospital
house
on
the
15th
of
October
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
Mrs.
Proudie
express
a
wish
that
they
should
all
be
there
on
the
next
morning
,
the
girl
would
have
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
when
will
the
pay
begin
?
"
ask
the
eld
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
-
day
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
gratified
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
jolly
,
"
say
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Proudie
insist
on
our
go
down
to
the
house
,
"
continue
the
mother
,
"
and
when
there
,
I
think
I
may
save
a
journey
by
measure
some
of
the
room
and
window
;
so
I
get
a
knot
of
tape
from
Bobbins
.
<EOS>
Bobbins
be
as
civil
as
you
please
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
thank
him
,
"
say
Letty
the
young
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
the
way
of
the
world
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
They
all
do
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
may
just
as
well
be
angry
with
the
turkey
cock
for
gobble
at
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
bird
's
nature
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
she
enunciate
to
her
bairn
the
upshot
of
her
practical
experience
,
she
pull
from
her
pocket
the
portion
of
tape
which
show
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
various
room
at
the
hospital
house
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
we
will
leave
her
happy
in
her
toil
.
  
<EOS>
the
Quiverfuls
have
hardly
leave
the
palace
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
be
still
hold
forth
on
the
matter
to
her
husband
,
when
another
visitor
be
announce
in
the
person
of
Dr.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
the
Master
of
Lazarus
have
ask
for
the
bishop
and
not
for
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
therefore
when
he
be
show
into
the
study
,
he
be
surprised
rather
than
rejoice
to
find
the
lady
there
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
must
go
back
a
little
,
and
it
shall
be
<EOS>
but
a
little
,
for
a
difficulty
begin
to
make
itself
manifest
in
the
necessity
of
dispose
of
all
our
friend
in
the
small
remainder
of
this
one
volume
.
<EOS>
oh
,
that
Mr.
Longman
would
allow
me
a
fourth
!
<EOS>
It
should
transcend
the
other
three
as
the
seventh
heaven
transcend
all
the
low
stage
of
celestial
bliss
.
  
<EOS>
go
home
in
the
carriage
that
evening
from
Ullathorne
,
Dr.
Gwynne
have
not
without
difficulty
bring
round
his
friend
the
archdeacon
to
a
line
of
tactic
much
less
bellicose
than
that
which
his
own
taste
would
have
prefer
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
unseemly
in
us
to
show
ourselves
in
a
bad
humour
;
moreover
,
we
have
no
power
in
this
matter
,
and
it
will
therefore
be
bad
policy
to
act
as
though
we
have
.
"
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
the
Master
of
Lazarus
argue
.
<EOS>
"
if
,
"
he
continue
,
"
the
bishop
be
determine
to
appoint
another
to
the
hospital
,
threat
will
not
prevent
him
,
and
threat
should
not
be
lightly
use
by
an
archdeacon
to
his
bishop
.
<EOS>
if
he
will
place
a
stranger
in
the
hospital
,
we
can
only
leave
him
to
the
indignation
of
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
such
a
step
may
not
eventually
injure
your
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
the
bishop
,
if
you
will
allow
me
 
alone
.
<EOS>
"
at
this
the
archdeacon
wince
visibly
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
alone
;
for
so
I
shall
be
calm
;
and
then
I
shall
at
any
rate
learn
what
he
do
mean
to
do
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
puffed
and
blow
,
put
up
the
carriage
window
and
then
put
it
down
again
,
argue
the
matter
up
to
his
own
gate
,
and
at
last
give
way
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
against
him
,
his
own
wife
,
Mr.
Harding
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
keep
him
out
of
hot
water
,
Dr.
Gwynne
,
"
Mrs.
Grantly
have
say
to
her
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
madam
,
I
will
do
my
good
,
"
the
courteous
master
have
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
do
it
and
earn
for
himself
the
gratitude
of
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
we
may
return
to
the
bishop
's
study
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
have
certainly
not
foresee
the
difficulty
which
here
present
itself
.
<EOS>
He
 
together
with
all
the
clerical
world
of
England
 
have
hear
it
rumour
about
that
Mrs.
Proudie
do
not
confine
herself
to
her
wardrobe
,
still
-
room
,
and
laundry
;
but
yet
it
have
never
occur
to
him
that
if
he
call
on
a
bishop
at
one
o'clock
in
the
day
,
he
could
by
any
possibility
find
him
closet
with
his
wife
;
or
that
if
he
do
so
,
the
wife
would
remain
long
than
necessary
to
make
her
curtsey
.
<EOS>
It
appear
,
however
,
as
though
in
the
present
case
Mrs.
Proudie
have
no
idea
of
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
be
very
much
pleased
with
Dr.
Gwynne
on
the
precede
day
,
and
of
course
think
that
Dr.
Gwynne
have
be
as
much
pleased
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
attribute
the
visit
solely
to
compliment
,
and
think
it
an
extremely
gracious
and
proper
thing
for
the
Master
of
Lazarus
to
drive
over
from
Plumstead
specially
to
call
at
the
palace
so
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
they
be
not
on
the
same
side
either
in
politic
or
doctrine
make
the
compliment
the
great
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
therefore
,
be
all
smile
.
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
who
like
people
with
good
handle
to
their
name
,
be
also
very
well
disposed
to
welcome
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
charming
party
at
Ullathorne
,
Master
,
have
we
not
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mrs.
Grantly
get
home
without
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
say
that
they
have
all
be
a
little
tired
,
but
be
none
the
bad
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
excellent
person
,
Miss
Thorne

suggest
the
bishop

<EOS>

<EOS>
and
an
exemplary
Christian

Mrs.

<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
declare
that
he
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
see
her
Sabbath

day
school
yet

continue
the
lady
,
"
but
I
shall
make
a
point
of
do
so
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
merely
bow
at
this
intimation
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
something
of
Mrs.
Proudie
and
her
Sunday
-
school
,
both
from
Dr.
Grantly
and
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
the
by
,
Master
,
"
continue
the
lady
,
"
I
wonder
whether
Mrs.
grantly
would
like
me
to
drive
over
and
inspect
her
Sabbath
-
day
school
.
<EOS>
I
hear
that
it
be
most
excellently
keep
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
really
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
Mrs.
grantly
would
be
most
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Proudie
any
day
Mrs.
Proudie
would
do
her
the
honour
of
call
:
that
be
,
of
course
,
if
Mrs.
grantly
should
happen
to
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
a
slight
cloud
darken
the
lady
's
brow
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
her
offer
be
not
take
in
good
part
.
<EOS>
this
generation
of
unregenerated
viper
be
still
perverse
,
stiff
-
necked
,
and
harden
in
their
iniquity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
I
know
,
"
say
she
,
"
set
his
face
against
these
institution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
Dr.
Gwynne
laugh
slightly
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
smile
.
<EOS>
have
he
give
his
cap
for
it
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
frown
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
suffer
little
child
,
and
forbid
them
not

"
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
be
we
not

Dr.
Gwynne

<EOS>
"
take
heed

these
little

<EOS>
"
be

Dr.
Gwynne

"
<EOS>
and
at
each
of
these
question
she
raise
at
him
her
menacing
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
madam
,
certainly

"
say
the
master
,
"
and
so
do
the
archdeacon
,
I
be
sure
,
on
weekday
as
well
as
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
weekday
you
can
not
take
heed
not
to
despise
them
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
because
then
they
be
out
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
on
weekday
they
belong
to
their
parent
,
but
on
Sundays
they
ought
to
belong
to
the
clergyman

"
<EOS>
and
the
finger
be
again
raise
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
begin
to
understand
and
to
share
the
intense
disgust
which
the
archdeacon
always
express
when
Mrs.
Proudie
's
name
be
mention
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
with
such
a
woman
as
this
?
<EOS>
to
take
his
hat
and
go
would
have
be
his
natural
resource
,
but
then
he
do
not
wish
to
be
foil
in
his
object
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
on
business

if
you

spare
me
one
moment

leisure

<EOS>
I
know
I
must
apologize
for
so
disturb
you

but
in
truth
I
will
not
detain
you
five
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly

certainly

the
bishop

<EOS>

You
have
a
great
deal

at

Bishop

<EOS>
do
not
forget
how
extremely
busy
you
be
at
present
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
,
whose
spirit
be
now
up
,
for
she
be
angry
with
her
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
delay
his
lordship
much
above
a
minute
,
"
say
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
rise
from
his
chair
and
expect
that
Mrs.
Proudie
would
now
go
,
or
else
that
the
bishop
would
lead
the
way
into
another
room
.
  
<EOS>
but
neither
event
seem
likely
to
occur
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
stand
for
a
moment
silent
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
about
Hiram
's
Hospital
?
"
suggest
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
,
lose
in
astonishment
,
and
not
know
what
else
on
earth
to
do
,
confess
that
his
business
with
the

Hiram

<EOS>
"
His
lordship
have
finally
confer
the
appointment
on
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
,
"
say
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
make
a
simple
reference
to
the
bishop
,
and
find
that
the
lady
's
statement
be
formally
confirm
,
he
take
his
leave

<EOS>
"
that
come
of
the
reform
bill

he
say
to
himself
as
he
walk
down
the
bishop

avenue

"
<EOS>
well
,
at
any
rate
the
greek
play
bishop

not
so
bad
as
that

"
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
Mr.
Slope
,
as
he
start
for
Ullathorne
,
receive
a
dispatch
from
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
,
which
have
the
effect
of
put
him
in
that
high
good
humour
which
subsequent
event
somewhat
untowardly
damp
.
<EOS>
It
run
as
follow
.
<EOS>
Its
shortness
will
be
its
sufficient
apology
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
SIR
,
  
I
wish
you
every
success
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
help
you
,
but
if
I
can
,
I
will
.
  
<EOS>
yours
ever
,
T.
t.
  
30/9/185
    
<EOS>
there
be
more
in
this
than
in
all
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
's
flummery
;
more
than
in
all
the
bishop
's
promise
,
even
have
they
be
ever
so
sincere
;
more
than
in
any
archbishop
's
good
word
,
even
have
it
be
possible
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
would
do
for
him
what
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
from
his
youth
upwards
be
a
firm
believer
in
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
He
have
dabble
in
it
himself
ever
since
he
have
take
his
degree
,
and
he
regard
it
as
the
great
arranger
and
distributor
of
all
future
british
terrestrial
affair
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
yet
arrive
at
the
age
,
an
age
which
sooner
or
later
come
to
most
of
us
,
which
dissipate
the
golden
dream
of
youth
.
<EOS>
He
delight
in
the
idea
of
wrest
power
from
the
hand
of
his
country
's
magnate
and
place
it
in
a
custody
which
be
at
any
rate
near
to
his
own
reach
.
<EOS>
sixty
thousand
broadsheet
disperse
themselves
daily
among
his
reading
fellow
citizen
form
in
his
eye
a
well
depot
for
supremacy
than
a
throne
at
Windsor
,
a
cabinet
in
Downing
Street
,
or
even
an
assembly
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
and
on
this
subject
we
must
not
quarrel
with
Mr.
Slope
,
for
the
feeling
be
too
general
to
be
meet
with
disrespect
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
be
as
good
,
if
not
well
,
than
his
promise
.
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
spout
forth
public
opinion
with
sixty
thousand
loud
clarion
,
do
proclaim
to
the
world
that
Mr.
Slope
be
the
fitting
man
for
the
vacant
post
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
for
Mr.
Slope
to
read
the
follow
line
in
the
Barchester
news
-
room
,
which
he
do
within
thirty
minute
after
the
morning
train
from
London
have
reach
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
now
five
year
since
we
call
the
attention
of
our
reader
to
the
quiet
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
from
that
day
to
this
,
we
have
in
no
way
meddle
with
the
affair
of
that
happy
ecclesiastical
community
.
<EOS>
since
then
,
an
old
bishop
have
die
there
,
and
a
young
bishop
have
be
instal
;
but
we
believe
we
do
not
do
more
than
give
some
customary
record
of
the
interesting
event
.
<EOS>
nor
be
we
now
about
to
meddle
very
deeply
in
the
affair
of
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
if
any
of
the
chapter
feel
a
qualm
of
conscience
on
read
thus
far
,
let
it
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
above
all
,
let
the
mind
of
the
new
bishop
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
not
arm
for
war
,
but
approach
the
reverend
tower
of
the
old
cathedral
with
an
olive
branch
in
our
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
at
the
time
allude
to
,
now
five
year
past
,
we
have
occasion
to
remark
on
the
state
of
a
charity
in
Barchester
call
Hiram
's
hospital
.
<EOS>
We
think
that
it
be
maladministered
,
and
that
the
very
estimable
and
reverend
gentleman
who
hold
the
office
of
warden
be
somewhat
too
highly
pay
for
duty
which
be
somewhat
too
easily
perform
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
 
<EOS>
and
we
say
it
in
all
sincerity
and
with
no
touch
of
sarcasm
 
<EOS>
have
never
look
on
the
matter
in
this
light
before
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
wish
to
take
praise
to
ourselves
whether
praise
be
due
to
us
or
not
.
<EOS>
but
the
consequence
of
our
remark
be
that
the
warden
do
look
into
the
matter
,
and
find
on
so
do
that
he
himself
could
come
to
no
other
opinion
than
that
express
by
us
,
he
very
creditably
throw
up
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
the
then
bishop
as
creditably
decline
to
fill
the
vacancy
till
the
affair
be
put
on
a
well
footing
.
<EOS>
Parliament
then
take
it
up
,
and
we
have
now
the
satisfaction
of
inform
our
reader
that
Hiram
's
Hospital
will
be
immediately
reopen
under
new
auspex
.
<EOS>
heretofore
,
provision
be
make
for
the
maintenance
of
twelve
old
man
.
<EOS>
this
will
now
be
extend
to
the
fair
sex
,
and
twelve
elderly
woman
,
if
any
such
can
be
find
in
Barchester
,
will
be
add
to
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
a
matron
;
there
will
,
it
be
hope
,
be
school
attach
for
the
poor
of
the
child
of
the
poor
,
and
there
will
be
a
steward
.
<EOS>
the
warden
,
for
there
will
still
be
a
warden
,
will
receive
an
income
more
in
keep
with
the
extent
of
the
charity
than
that
heretofore
pay
.
<EOS>
the
stipend
we
believe
will
be
£
450
.
<EOS>
We
may
add
that
the
excellent
house
which
the
former
warden
inhabit
will
still
be
attach
to
the
situation
.
  
<EOS>
Barchester
Hospital
can
not
perhaps
boast
a
world
-
wide
reputation
,
but
as
we
advert
to
its
state
of
decadence
,
we
think
it
right
also
to
advert
to
its
renaissance
.
<EOS>
May
it
go
on
and
prosper
.
<EOS>
whether
the
salutary
reform
which
have
be
introduce
within
its
wall
have
be
carry
as
far
as
could
have
be
desire
may
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>
the
important
question
of
the
school
appear
to
be
somewhat
leave
to
the
discretion
of
the
new
warden
.
<EOS>
this
may
have
be
make
the
most
important
part
of
the
establishment
,
and
the
new
warden
,
whom
we
trust
we
shall
not
offend
by
the
freedom
of
our
remark
,
may
have
be
select
with
some
view
to
his
fitness
as
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
now
look
a
gift
-
horse
in
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
May
the
hospital
go
on
and
prosper
!
<EOS>
the
situation
of
warden
have
of
course
be
offer
to
the
gentleman
who
so
honourably
vacate
it
five
year
since
,
but
we
be
give
to
understand
that
he
have
decline
it
.
<EOS>
whether
the
lady
who
have
be
introduce
be
in
his
estimation
too
much
for
his
power
of
control
,
whether
it
be
that
the
diminished
income
do
not
offer
to
him
sufficient
temptation
to
resume
his
old
place
,
or
that
he
have
in
the
meantime
assume
other
clerical
duty
,
we
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
We
be
,
however
,
inform
that
he
have
refuse
the
offer
and
that
the
situation
have
be
accept
by
Mr.
Quiverful
,
the
vicar
of
Puddingdale
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
we
think
be
due
to
Hiram
redivivus
.
<EOS>
but
while
we
be
on
the
subject
of
Barchester
,
we
will
venture
with
all
respectful
humility
to
express
our
opinion
on
another
matter
connect
with
the
ecclesiastical
polity
of
that
ancient
city
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Trefoil
,
the
dean
,
die
yesterday
.
<EOS>
a
short
record
of
his
death
,
give
his
age
and
the
various
piece
of
preferment
which
he
have
at
different
time
hold
,
will
be
find
in
another
column
of
this
paper
.
<EOS>
the
only
fault
we
know
in
him
be
his
age
,
and
as
that
be
a
crime
of
which
we
all
hope
to
be
guilty
,
we
will
not
bear
heavily
on
it
.
<EOS>
May
he
rest
in
peace
!
<EOS>
but
though
the
great
age
of
an
expire
dean
can
not
be
make
matter
of
reproach
,
we
be
not
inclined
to
look
on
such
a
fault
as
at
all
pardonable
in
a
dean
just
bring
to
the
birth
.
<EOS>
We
do
hope
that
the
day
of
sexagenarian
appointment
be
past
.
<EOS>
if
we
want
dean
,
we
must
want
them
for
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
that
purpose
will
necessarily
be
better
fulfil
by
a
man
of
forty
than
by
a
man
of
sixty
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
pay
dean
at
all
,
we
be
to
pay
them
for
some
sort
of
work
.
<EOS>
that
work
,
be
it
what
it
may
,
will
be
best
perform
by
a
workman
in
the
prime
of
life
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Trefoil
,
we
see
,
be
eighty
when
he
die
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
as
yet
complete
no
plan
for
pension
superannuated
clergyman
,
we
do
not
wish
to
get
rid
of
any
exist
dean
of
that
age
.
<EOS>
but
we
prefer
have
as
few
such
as
possible
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
of
seventy
be
now
appoint
,
we
beg
to
point
out
to
Lord
 
---
that
he
will
be
past
all
use
in
a
year
or
two
,
if
indeed
he
be
not
so
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
will
allow
us
to
remind
him
that
all
man
be
not
evergreen
like
himself
.
  
<EOS>
We
hear
that
Mr.
Slope
's
name
have
be
mention
for
this
preferment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
be
at
present
chaplain
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
a
well
man
could
hardly
be
select
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
talent
,
young
,
active
,
and
conversant
with
the
affair
of
the
cathedral
;
he
be
moreover
,
we
conscientiously
believe
,
a
truly
pious
clergyman
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
his
service
in
the
city
of
Barchester
have
be
highly
appreciate
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
eloquent
preacher
and
a
ripe
scholar
.
<EOS>
such
a
selection
as
this
would
go
far
to
raise
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
present
administration
of
church
patronage
and
would
teach
man
to
believe
that
from
henceforth
the
establishment
of
our
church
will
not
afford
easy
couch
to
wear
-
out
clerical
voluptuary
.
  
<EOS>
stand
at
a
reading
-
desk
in
the
Barchester
news
-
room
,
Mr.
Slope
digest
this
article
with
considerable
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
what
be
therein
say
as
to
the
hospital
be
now
comparatively
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
glad
that
he
have
not
succeed
in
restore
to
the
place
the
father
of
that
virago
who
have
so
audaciously
outrage
all
decency
in
his
person
,
and
be
so
far
satisfied
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Proudie
's
nominee
be
appoint
,
and
he
be
so
far
dissatisfied
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
however
,
be
now
soar
above
Mrs.
Bold
or
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
He
be
sufficiently
conversant
with
the
tactic
of
"
the
Jupiter
"
to
know
that
the
pith
of
the
article
would
lie
in
the
last
paragraph
.
<EOS>
the
place
of
honour
be
give
to
him
,
and
it
be
indeed
as
honourable
as
even
he
could
have
wish
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
grateful
to
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
,
and
with
full
heart
look
forward
to
the
day
when
he
may
entertain
him
in
princely
style
at
his
own
full
-
spread
board
in
the
deanery
dining
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
well
for
Mr.
Slope
that
Dr.
Trefoil
have
die
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
those
caterer
for
our
morning
repast
,
the
staff
of
"
the
Jupiter
,
"
have
be
sorely
put
to
it
for
the
last
month
to
find
a
sufficiency
of
proper
pabulum
.
<EOS>
just
then
there
be
no
talk
of
a
new
american
president
.
<EOS>
no
wonderful
tragedy
have
occur
on
railway
train
in
Georgia
,
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dearth
of
break
bank
,
and
a
dead
dean
with
the
necessity
for
a
live
one
be
a
godsend
.
<EOS>
have
Dr.
Trefoil
die
in
June
,
Mr.
Towers
would
probably
not
have
know
so
much
about
the
piety
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
we
will
leave
Mr.
Slope
for
awhile
in
his
triumph
,
explain
,
however
,
that
his
feeling
be
not
altogether
of
a
triumphant
nature
.
<EOS>
His
rejection
by
the
widow
,
or
rather
the
method
of
his
rejection
,
gall
him
terribly
.
<EOS>
for
day
to
come
he
positively
feel
the
sting
upon
his
cheek
whenever
he
think
of
what
have
be
do
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
refrain
from
call
her
by
harsh
name
,
speak
to
himself
as
he
walk
through
the
street
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
when
he
say
his
prayer
,
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
when
he
strove
to
do
so
,
his
mind
recoil
from
the
attempt
,
and
in
lieu
of
forgiving
run
off
in
a
double
spirit
of
vindictiveness
,
dwell
on
the
extent
of
the
injury
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
and
so
his
prayer
drop
senseless
from
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
signora
 
<EOS>
what
would
he
not
have
give
to
be
able
to
hate
her
also
?
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
worship
the
very
sofa
on
which
she
be
ever
lie
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
it
be
not
all
rise
colour
with
Mr.
Slope
,
although
his
hope
run
high
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
at
home
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Bold
,
when
she
get
home
from
Ullathorne
on
the
evening
of
Miss
Thorne
's
party
,
be
very
unhappy
and
,
moreover
,
very
tired
.
<EOS>
nothing
fatigue
the
body
so
much
as
weariness
of
spirit
,
and
Eleanor
's
spirit
be
indeed
weary
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
have
civilly
<EOS>
but
not
very
cordially
ask
her
in
to
tea
,
and
her
manner
of
refusal
convince
the
worthy
doctor
that
he
nee
not
repeat
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
exactly
make
himself
a
party
to
the
intrigue
which
be
to
convert
the
late
Mr.
Bold
's
patrimony
into
an
income
for
his
hopeful
son
,
but
he
have
be
well
aware
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
well
aware
also
,
when
he
perceive
that
Bertie
decline
accompany
them
home
in
the
carriage
,
that
the
affair
have
go
off
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
very
much
afraid
that
Charlotte
would
have
dart
out
upon
her
,
as
the
prebendary
get
out
at
his
own
door
,
but
Bertie
have
thoughtfully
save
her
from
this
by
cause
the
carriage
to
go
round
by
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
this
also
Dr.
Stanhope
understand
and
allow
to
pass
by
without
remark
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
get
home
,
she
find
Mary
Bold
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
the
child
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
rush
forward
and
,
throw
herself
on
her
knee
,
kiss
the
little
fellow
till
she
almost
frighten
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mary
,
I
be
so
glad
you
do
not
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
odious
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
the
question
of
Mary
's
go
have
be
one
greatly
moot
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
when
invite
,
have
be
the
guest
of
the
Grantlys
,
and
Miss
Thorne
,
who
have
chiefly
know
Eleanor
at
the
hospital
or
at
Plumstead
Rectory
,
have
forget
all
about
Mary
Bold
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
-
in
-
law
have
implore
her
to
go
under
her
wing
and
have
offer
to
write
to
Miss
Thorne
,
or
to
call
on
her
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Bold
have
decline
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Mr.
Bold
have
not
be
very
popular
with
such
people
as
the
Thornes
,
and
his
sister
would
not
go
among
them
unless
she
be
specially
ask
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
Mary
cheerfully
,
"
I
have
the
less
to
regret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
to
regret
;
but
oh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
I
have
 
so
much
 
so
much
;
"
and
then
she
begin
kiss
her
boy
,
whom
her
caress
have
rouse
from
his
slumber
.
<EOS>
when
she
raise
her
head
,
Mary
see
that
the
tear
be
run
down
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
,
Eleanor
<EOS>
,
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
what
have
happen
to
you
 
Eleanor
 
<EOS>
dear
Eleanor
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mary
get
up
with
the
boy
still
in
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
him
to
me
 
give
him
to
me
,
"
say
the
young
mother
.
<EOS>
"
give
him
to
me
,
Mary
,
"
and
she
almost
tear
the
child
out
of
her
sister
's
arm
.
<EOS>
the
poor
little
fellow
murmur
somewhat
at
the
disturbance
but
nevertheless
nestled
himself
close
into
his
mother
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Mary
,
take
the
cloak
from
me
.
<EOS>
My
own
own
darling
,
darling
,
darle
jewel
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
false
to
me
.
<EOS>
everybody
else
be
false
;
everybody
else
be
cruel
.
<EOS>
Mamma
will
care
for
nobody
,
nobody
,
nobody
,
but
her
own
,
own
,
own
little
man
;
"
and
she
again
kiss
and
press
the
baby
and
cry
till
the
tear
run
down
over
the
child
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
have
be
cruel
to
you
,
Eleanor
?
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
in
this
matter
Eleanor
have
great
cause
for
mental
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
certainly
accuse
her
love
sister
-
in
-
law
of
cruelty
;
but
she
have
to
do
that
which
be
more
gall
:
she
have
to
accuse
herself
of
imprudence
against
which
her
sister
-
in
-
law
have
warn
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bold
have
never
encourage
Eleanor
's
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
she
have
positively
discourage
the
friendship
of
the
Stanhopes
,
as
far
as
her
usual
gentle
mode
of
speak
have
permit
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
only
laugh
at
her
,
however
,
when
she
say
that
she
disapprove
of
married
woman
who
live
apart
from
their
husband
and
suggest
that
Charlotte
Stanhope
never
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
Eleanor
must
either
hold
her
tongue
,
which
be
quite
impossible
,
or
confess
herself
to
have
be
utterly
wrong
,
which
be
nearly
equally
so
.
<EOS>
so
she
stave
off
the
evil
day
by
more
tear
,
and
console
herself
by
induce
little
Johnny
to
rouse
himself
sufficiently
to
return
her
caress
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
darling
 
as
true
as
gold
.
<EOS>
what
would
mamma
do
without
him
?
<EOS>
Mamma
would
lie
down
and
die
if
she
have
not
her
own
Johnny
Bold
to
give
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
and
much
more
she
say
of
the
same
kind
,
and
for
a
time
make
no
other
answer
to
Mary
's
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
this
kind
of
consolation
from
the
world
's
deceit
be
very
common
.
<EOS>
mother
obtain
it
from
their
child
,
and
man
from
their
dog
.
<EOS>
some
man
even
do
so
from
their
walking
-
stick
,
which
be
just
as
rational
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
we
can
take
joy
to
ourselves
in
that
we
be
not
deceive
by
those
who
have
not
attain
the
art
to
deceive
us
?
<EOS>
in
a
true
man
,
if
such
can
be
find
,
or
a
true
woman
,
much
consolation
may
indeed
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
caress
of
her
child
,
however
,
Eleanor
do
receive
consolation
,
and
may
ill
befall
the
man
who
would
begrudge
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
evil
day
,
however
,
be
only
postpone
.
<EOS>
She
have
to
tell
her
disagreeable
tale
to
Mary
,
and
she
have
also
to
tell
it
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
Must
it
not
,
indeed
,
be
tell
to
the
whole
circle
of
her
acquaintance
before
she
could
be
make
to
stand
all
right
with
them
?
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
there
be
no
one
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
hate
Mr.
Slope
;
that
be
a
matter
of
course
;
in
that
feeling
she
revel
.
<EOS>
She
hate
and
despise
the
Stanhopes
;
but
that
feeling
distress
her
greatly
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
as
it
be
,
separate
herself
from
her
old
friend
to
throw
herself
into
the
arm
of
this
family
;
and
then
how
have
they
intend
to
use
her
?
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
reconcile
herself
to
her
own
father
,
who
have
believe
ill
of
her
.
<EOS>
Mary
Bold
have
turn
Mentor
.
<EOS>
that
she
could
have
forgive
have
the
Mentor
turn
out
to
be
in
the
wrong
,
but
Mentors
in
the
right
be
not
to
be
pardon
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
hate
the
archdeacon
,
and
now
she
hate
him
worse
than
ever
,
for
she
must
in
some
sort
humble
herself
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
hate
her
sister
,
for
she
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
have
hate
Mr.
Arabin
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
He
have
pretend
to
regard
her
,
and
yet
before
her
face
he
have
hang
over
that
italian
woman
as
though
there
have
be
no
beauty
in
the
world
but
<EOS>
her
 
<EOS>
no
other
woman
worth
a
moment
's
attention
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Arabin
would
have
to
learn
all
this
about
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
She
tell
herself
that
she
hate
him
,
and
she
know
that
she
be
lie
to
herself
as
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
consolation
but
her
baby
,
and
of
that
she
make
the
most
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
though
she
could
not
surmise
what
it
be
that
have
so
violently
affect
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
see
at
once
that
her
grief
be
too
great
to
be
keep
under
control
and
wait
patiently
till
the
child
should
be
in
his
cradle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
some
tea
,
Eleanor
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
care
,
"
say
she
,
though
in
fact
she
must
have
be
very
hungry
,
for
she
have
eat
nothing
at
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
quietly
make
the
tea
,
and
butter
the
bread
,
lay
aside
the
cloak
,
and
make
thing
look
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
fast
asleep

"
say
she
;
"
you
be
very
tired
;
let
me
take
him
up
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Eleanor
would
not
let
her
sister
touch
him
.
<EOS>
She
look
wistfully
at
her
baby
's
eye
,
see
that
they
be
lose
in
the
deep
slumber
,
and
then
make
a
sort
of
couch
for
him
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
be
determine
that
nothing
should
prevail
upon
her
to
let
him
out
of
her
sight
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
nelly
,
"
say
Mary
,
"
do
not
be
cross
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
at
least
have
do
nothing
to
offend
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
angry
then

surely
you
can
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I

at

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
not

drink
the
tea
I
have

you

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
want
it

"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
do
drink
it
,
and
allow
herself
to
be
persuade
.
<EOS>
She
eat
and
drank
,
and
as
the
inner
woman
be
recruit
she
feel
a
little
more
charitable
towards
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
find
word
to
begin
her
story
,
and
before
she
go
to
bed
she
have
make
a
clean
breast
of

she

of
the
blow
she
have
give
to

I
have

protect
myself

<EOS>

Eleanor

whose
mind

Mr.

almost
bloodthirsty

"
<EOS>
have
I
stab
him
with
a
dagger

he
would
have
deserve
it

what

about
it
at
plumstead

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I
should
tell
them

say
Mary

<EOS>
Eleanor
begin
to
think
that
she
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
there
could
have
be
no
kinder
comforter
than
Mary
Bold
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
slight
dash
of
triumph
about
her
when
she
hear
of
the
Stanhope
scheme
,
nor
do
she
allude
to
her
former
opinion
when
Eleanor
call
her
late
friend
Charlotte
<EOS>
a
base
,
design
woman
.
<EOS>
She
re
-
echo
all
the
abuse
that
be
heap
on
Mr.
Slope
's
head
and
never
hint
that
she
have
say
as
much
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
so
,
I
tell
you
so
!
<EOS>
"
be
the
croak
of
a
true
Job
's
comforter
.
<EOS>
but
Mary
,
when
she
find
her
friend
lie
in
her
sorrow
and
scrape
herself
with
potsherd
,
forbore
to
argue
and
to
exult
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
acknowledge
the
merit
of
the
forbearance
,
and
at
length
allow
herself
to
be
tranquilise
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
she
do
not
go
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
barchester
<EOS>
she
think
would
be
crowd
with
Stanhopes
and
slope
;
perhaps
also
with
Arabins
and
Grantlys
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
hardly
anyone
among
her
friend
whom
she
could
have
meet
without
some
cause
of
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
she
hear
that
the
dean
be
dead
,
and
she
also
hear
that
Mr.
Quiverful
have
be
finally
appoint
to
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
her
father
come
to
her
,
and
then
the
story
,
or
as
much
of
it
as
she
could
bring
herself
to
tell
him
,
have
to
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
truth
much
surprised
at
Mr.
Slope
's
effrontery
,
but
he
be
oblige
to
act
as
though
he
have
be
to
save
his
daughter
's
feeling

<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
anything

skilful
in
his
deceit

she
see
through
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
you
think
it
only
in
the
common
course
of
thing
that
Mr.

treat
me
in

way

She
have
say
nothing

<EOS>

It
be

that

have
so
much
audacity

without

have
receive
the

"
  
<EOS>
to
this
Mr.
Harding
answer
nothing
.
<EOS>
with
the
archdeacon
it
would
have
be
the
text
for
a
rejoinder
which
would
not
have
disgrace
Bildad

Shuhite

<EOS>
"

you
will
tell
the
archdeacon

ask
Mr.

tell
him

she
sharply

Susan

continue
Mr.

You

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
do
not
allow
himself
to
be
talk
over
into
give
up
his
own
and
only
little
_
pie

in
the
High

<EOS>
He
promise
to
come
and
dine
with
his
daughter
,
and
stay
with
her
,
and
visit
her
,
and
do
everything
but
absolutely
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
suit
the
peculiar
feeling
of
the
man
to
tell
his
daughter
that
though
she
have
reject
Mr.
Slope
,
and
be
ready
to
reject
Mr.
Stanhope
,
some
other
more
favoured
suitor
would
probably
soon
appear
,
and
that
on
the
appearance
of
such
a
suitor
the
big
front
bedroom
may
perhaps
be
more
frequently
in
requisition
than
at
present
.
<EOS>
but
doubtless
such
an
idea
cross
his
mind
,
and
add
its
weight
to
the
other
reason
which
make
him
decide
on
still
keep
the
close
,
odious
little
room
in
High
Street
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
over
quietly
and
in
comfort
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
always
happy
with
her
father
than
with
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
perhaps
,
any
natural
taste
for
baby
-
worship
,
but
he
be
always
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
,
and
therefore
make
an
excellent
third
in
a
trio
with
his
daughter
and
Mary
Bold
in
singe
the
praise
of
the
wonderful
child

<EOS>
They

stand
together
over
their

in
the
evening

the

again
be
put
to
bed
upon
the
sofa

when
the
servant
bring
in
a
very
small
note
in
a
beautiful
pink
envelope

It
quite
fill

perfume

Mr.

be
sit
close

Eleanor
get
very
red
in

the

Charlotte

epistle
,
to
which
she
be
well
accustomed
,
be
of
a
very
different
style
and
kind
.
<EOS>
She
generally
write
on
large
note
-
paper
;
she
twist
up
her
letter
into
the
shape
and
sometimes
into
the
size
of
cocked
hat
;
she
address
them
in
a
sprawling
,
manly
hand
,
and
not
unusually
add
a
blot
or
a
smudge
,
as
though
such
be
her
own
peculiar
sign
-
manual
.
<EOS>
the
address
of
this
note
be
write
in
a
beautiful
female
hand
,
and
the
gummed
wafer
bore
on
it
an
impress
of
a
gilt
coronet
.
<EOS>
though
Eleanor
have
never
see
such
a
one
before
,
she
guess
that
it
come
from
the
signora
.
<EOS>
such
epistle
be
very
numerously
send
out
from
any
house
in
which
the
signora
may
happen
to
be
dwell
,
but
they
be
rarely
address
to
lady
.
<EOS>
when
the
coachman
be
tell
by
the
lady
's
maid
to
take
the
letter
to
Mrs.
Bold
,
he
openly
express
his
opinion
that
there
be
some
mistake
about
it
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
lady
's
maid
box
the
coachman
's
ear

<EOS>
have
Mr.
Slope
see
in
how
meek
a
spirit
the
coachman
take
the
rebuke
,
he
may
have
learn
a
useful
lesson
,
both
in
philosophy
and
religion

<EOS>
the
note
be
as
follow

It
may
be
take

a
faithful

my

May
I
ask
you

as
a
great
favour

to
call

morrow

<EOS>
You
can
say
what
hour
will
best
suit
you

but
quite
early
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
if
I
could
call
upon
you
,
I
should
not
take
this
liberty
with
you

<EOS>
I
partly
know

occur
the
other

I
promise
you

My
brother

us
for
London
to

day
;
from
thence
he
go
to
Italy

<EOS>
It
will
probably
occur
to
you
that
I
should
not
thus
intrude
on
you
,
unless
I
have
that
to
say
to
you
which
may

at

quick
ear
detect
her
brother

catlike
step
in
the
hall

<EOS>
She
say
nothing
,
feel
that
for
the
present
Bertie
have
better
keep
out
of
her
father
's
way
.
<EOS>
but
Dr.

also
hear
the
sound
of
the
lock
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
that

open

hear
the
call
,
require
no
further
bidding
,
but
walk
in
with
a
perfectly
unconcerned
and
cheerful
air
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
peculiar
_
insouciance

anger
Dr.
Stanhope
,
even
more
than
his

extravagance

very
sternly

I
will
trouble
you

too

Charlotte

can
wait
for

tea
a

minute

<EOS>
Charlotte
sit
down
on
the
chair
near
to
the
door
in
somewhat
of
a
perverse
sort
of
manner
,
as
much
as
though
she
would
say
 
"
well
,
here
I
be
;
you
shall
not
say
I
do

do
what
I

and
she
be
determine
not
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
She
too
be
angry
with
Bertie
,
but
she
be
not
the
less
ready
on
that
account
to
defend
him
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
Bertie
also
sit
down
.
<EOS>
He
draw
his
chair
close
to
the
library
-
table
,
upon
which
he
put
his
elbow
,
and
then
rest
his
face
comfortably
on
one
hand
,
he
begin
draw
little
picture
on
a
sheet
of
paper
with
the
other

<EOS>
before

scene
be
over

admirable
figure

De
Courcy

and
begin
a
family
piece
to
comprise
the
whole
set

the
Lookalofts

<EOS>
"
Would
it
suit
you
,
sir

"
say
the
father
,
"
to
give
me
some
idea
as
to
what
your
present
intention
be

what
way
of
live

to
yourself

that

leave
my
house

<EOS>
"
to
-
night
?
"
say
Bertie
,
and
the
simple
tone
of
the
question
leave
the
doctor
without
any
adequately
dignified
method
of
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
papa
do
not
quite
mean
to
-
night
,

very
well

Will
the
4.30
P.M.
train

<EOS>
and
Bertie
,
as
he
ask
,
put
the
finishing
touch
to
Miss
Thorne
's
high
-
heeled
boot
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
how
and
when

Charlotte

brow
grow
still
blacker
than

<EOS>
Hereupon
Mrs.

that
which

appear

Mrs.

would
have
give

not

<EOS>
She
do
blush
up

the

make

special

Mrs.

Her

real

She
be
mortify

conceal
his

show
it

there

Mr.
Slope
's
Parting
Interview
with
the
Signora
 
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
the
signora
be
in
her
pride
.
<EOS>
She
be
dressed
in
her
bright
of
morning
dress
,
and
have
quite
a
levée
round
her
couch
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautifully
bright
October
afternoon
;
all
the
gentleman
of
the
neighbourhood
be
in
Barchester
,
and
those
who
have
the
entry
of
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
be
in
the
signora
's
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
be
in
the
front
room
,
and
such
of
the
lady
's
squire
as
could
not
for
the
moment
get
near
the
centre
of
attraction
have
to
waste
their
fragrance
on
the
mother
and
sister
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
who
come
and
the
last
to
leave
be
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
second
visit
he
have
pay
to
Madame
Neroni
since
he
have
meet
her
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
He
come
,
he
know
not
why
,
to
talk
about
,
he
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
the
feeling
which
now
trouble
him
be
new
to
him
,
and
he
could
not
analyse
them
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
that
he
should
thus
come
dangle
about
Madame
Neroni
because
he
be
in
love
with
Mrs.
Bold
;
but
it
be
nevertheless
the
fact
;
and
though
he
could
not
understand
why
he
do
so
,
Madame
Neroni
understand
it
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
gentle
and
kind
to
him
and
have
encourage
his
staying
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
stay
on
.
<EOS>
She
press
his
hand
when
he
first
greet
her
;
she
make
him
remain
near
her
and
whisper
to
him
little
nothing
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
eye
,
brilliant
and
bright
,
now
mirthful
,
now
melancholy
,
and
invincible
in
either
way
!
<EOS>
what
man
with
warm
feeling
,
blood
unchille
,
and
a
heart
not
guard
by
a
triple
steel
of
experience
could
have
withstand
those
eye
!
<EOS>
the
lady
,
it
be
true
,
intend
to
do
him
no
mortal
injury
;
she
merely
choose
to
inhale
a
slight
breath
of
incense
before
she
hand
the
casket
over
to
another
.
<EOS>
whether
Mrs.
Bold
would
willingly
have
spare
even
so
much
be
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
come
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
now
know
that
Mr.
Slope
be
a
candidate
for
the
deanery
and
that
he
be
generally
consider
to
be
the
favourite
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
therefore
,
walk
rather
largely
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
He
give
to
himself
a
portly
air
,
such
as
may
become
a
dean
,
speak
but
little
to
other
clergyman
,
and
shun
the
bishop
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
how
the
meagre
little
prebendary
,
and
the
burly
chancellor
,
and
all
the
minor
canon
and
vicar
choral
,
ay
,
and
all
the
chorister
,
too
,
cower
and
shake
and
walk
about
with
long
face
when
they
read
or
hear
of
that
article
in
"
the
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
now
be
come
the
day
when
nothing
would
avail
to
keep
the
impure
spirit
from
the
cathedral
pulpit
.
<EOS>
that
pulpit
would
indeed
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
precentor
,
vicar
,
and
chorister
may
hang
up
their
harp
on
the
willow
.
<EOS>
Ichabod
!
<EOS>
Ichabod
!
<EOS>
the
glory
of
their
house
be
depart
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
great
as
he
be
with
embryo
grandeur
,
still
come
to
see
the
signora
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
could
not
keep
himself
away
.
<EOS>
He
dream
of
that
soft
hand
which
he
have
kiss
so
often
,
and
of
that
imperial
brow
which
his
lip
have
once
press
;
and
he
then
dream
also
of
further
favour
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Thorne
be
there
also
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
visit
he
have
ever
pay
to
the
signora
,
and
he
make
it
not
without
due
preparation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
be
a
gentleman
usually
precise
in
his
dress
and
prone
to
make
the
most
of
himself
in
an
unpretending
way
.
<EOS>
the
grey
hair
in
his
whisker
be
eliminate
perhaps
once
a
month
;
those
on
his
head
be
soften
by
a
mixture
which
we
will
not
call
a
dye
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
a
wash
.
<EOS>
His
tailor
live
in
St.
James

Street
,
and
his
bootmaker
at
the
corner
of
that
street
and
piccadilly
.
<EOS>
He
be
particular
in
the
article
of
glove
,
and
the
get
up
of
his
shirt
be
a
matter
not
lightly
think
of
in
the
ullathorne
laundry
.
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of
the
present
visit
he
have
rather
overdo
his
usual
effort
,
and
cause
some
little
uneasiness
to
his
sister
,
who
have
not
hitherto
receive
very
cordially
the
proposition
for
a
lengthen
visit
from
the
signora
at
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
other

and
when

<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne

and
Mr.

summarily

<EOS>
"

She

in
the
most
outlandish

She

Her

to
Mr.

<EOS>
this
badinage
be
peculiarly
painful

yet
he
could
not
tear
himself
away

leave
it

<EOS>
He
believe
,
still
believe
with
that
sort
of
belief
which
the
fear
of
a
thing
engender
,
that
Mrs.
Bold
would
probably
become
the
wife
of
Mr.

<EOS>
of
Mr.

he

Mr.

the

We

Mr.

have
seldom
in

feel
himself
less
at

<EOS>
there
sit
Mr.

laugh
silently

<EOS>
there
stand
his
old
antagonist
,
Mr.

gaze
at
him
with
all
his
eye

<EOS>
there
round
the
door

cluster
a

Messrs.

Green

all

discomfiture

<EOS>
He
know
that
it
depend
solely
on
his
own
wit
whether
or
no
he
could
throw
the
joke
back
upon
the
lady

<EOS>
He
know
that
it
stand
him
to
do
so
if
he
possibly
could

he
have
not
a
word

"
<EOS>
'
tis
conscience
that
make
coward
of
us
all

"
<EOS>
He
feel
on
his
cheek
the
sharp
point
of
Eleanor
's
finger
,
and
do
not
know
who
may
have
see
the
blow
,
who
may
have
tell
the
tale
to
this
pestilent
woman
who
take
such
delight
in
jeer
him

<EOS>
He
stand
there
,
therefore
,
red
as
a
carbuncle
and
mute
as
a
fish

grin
sufficiently
to
show
his
tooth

an
object
of
pity

<EOS>
but
the
signora
have
no
pity
;
she
know
nothing
of
mercy
.
<EOS>
Her
present
object
be
to
put
Mr.
Slope
down
,
and
she
be
determined
to
do
it
thoroughly
,
now
that
she
have
him
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
Mr.

,
no
answer

<EOS>
why
it
can
not
possibly
be
that
the
woman
have
be
fool
enough
to
refuse
you
?
<EOS>
She
can
not
surely
be
look
out
after
a
bishop

<EOS>
but
I
see
how
it
be
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
widow
be
proverbially
cautious
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
let
her
alone
till

till
you
could
show
her
the
key

<EOS>
"
Signora

"
say
he
at

try

you
really
permit
yourself

talk
on
solemn
subject

very
improper
way

"

solemn
subject
 
what
solemn

<EOS>
surely
a

hat
be
not
such
a
solemn

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
aspiration
such
as
those
you
impute

me

<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
drop
the
subject

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
Mr.
Slope
;
but
one
word
first
.
<EOS>
go
to
her
again
with
the
prime
minister
's
letter
in
your
pocket

<EOS>
I
will
wager
my
shawl
to
your
shovel
she
do
not
refuse
you
then

<EOS>
"
I
must
say
,
signora
,
that
I
think
you
be
speak
of
the
lady
in
a
very
unjustifiable
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
one
other
piece
of
advice
,
Mr.
Slope
;
I
will
only
offer
you
one
other
;
"
and
then
she
commence
singe
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
gude
to
be
merry
and
wise
,
Mr.
Slope
;
It
be
gude
to
be
honest
and
true
;
It
be
gude
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
 
Mr.
Slope
,
before
you
be
on
with
the
new
.
  
<EOS>
"
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
signora
,
throw
herself
back
on
her
sofa
,
laugh
merrily
.
<EOS>
She
little
recke
how
those
who
hear
her
would
,
in
their
own
imagination
,
fill
up
the
little
history
of
Mr.
Slope
's
first
love
.
<EOS>
She
little
care
that
some
among
them
may
attribute
to
her
the
honour
of
his
early
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
be
tired
of
Mr.
Slope
and
want
to
get
rid
of
him
;
she
have
grind
for
anger
with
him
,
and
she
choose
to
be
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
how
Mr.
Slope
get
out
of
that
room
he
never
himself
know
.
<EOS>
He
do
succeed
ultimately
,
and
probably
with
some
assistance
,
in
get
his
hat
and
escape
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
love
for
the
signora
be
cure
.
<EOS>
whenever
he
again
think
of
her
in
his
dream
,
it
be
not
as
of
an
angel
with
azure
wing
.
<EOS>
He
connect
her
rather
with
fire
and
brimstone
,
and
though
he
could
still
believe
her
to
be
a
spirit
,
he
banish
her
entirely
out
of
heaven
and
find
a
place
for
her
among
the
infernal
god
.
<EOS>
when
he
weigh
in
the
balance
,
as
he
not
seldom
do
,
the
two
woman
to
whom
he
have
attach
himself
in
Barchester
,
the
pre
-
eminent
place
in
his
soul
's
hatred
be
usually
allot
to
the
signora
.
   
<EOS>
the
Dean
Elect
 
<EOS>
during
the
entire
next
week
Barchester
be
ignorant
who
be
to
be
its
new
dean
.
<EOS>
on
Sunday
morning
Mr.
Slope
be
decidedly
the
favourite
,
but
he
do
not
show
himself
in
the
cathedral
,
and
then
he
sink
a
point
or
two
in
the
betting
.
<EOS>
on
Monday
he
get
a
scolding
from
the
bishop
in
the
hearing
of
the
servant
,
and
down
he
go
till
nobody
would
have
him
at
any
price
;
but
on
Tuesday
he
receive
a
letter
,
in
an
official
cover
,
mark
private
,
by
which
he
fully
recover
his
place
in
the
public
favour
.
<EOS>
on
Wednesday
he
be
say
to
be
ill
,
and
that
do
not
look
well
;
but
on
Thursday
morning
he
go
down
to
the
railway
station
with
a
very
jaunty
air
;
and
when
it
be
ascertain
that
he
have
take
a
first
-
class
ticket
for
London
,
there
be
no
longer
any
room
for
doubt
on
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
while
matter
be
in
this
state
of
ferment
at
Barchester
,
there
be
not
much
mental
comfort
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
the
archdeacon
have
many
ground
for
inward
grief
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
displeased
at
the
result
of
Dr.
Gwynne
's
diplomatic
mission
to
the
palace
,
and
do
not
even
scruple
to
say
to
his
wife
that
have
he
go
himself
,
he
would
have
manage
the
affair
much
better
.
<EOS>
His
wife
do
not
agree
with
him
,
but
that
do
not
mend
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
's
appointment
to
the
hospital
be
,
however
,
a
_
fait
accompli
_
,
and
Mr.
Harding
's
acquiescence
in
that
appointment
be
not
less
so
.
<EOS>
nothing
would
induce
Mr.
Harding
to
make
a
public
appeal
against
the
bishop
,
and
the
Master
of
Lazarus
quite
approve
of
his
not
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
have
come
to
the
master
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
over
and
over
again
.
"
<EOS>
He
use
to
be
ready
enough
to
stand
up
for
his
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Archdeacon
,
"
Mrs.
Grantly
would
say
in
reply
,
"
what
be
the
use
of
always
fight
?
<EOS>
I
really
think
the
master
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
master
,
however
,
have
take
step
of
his
own
of
which
neither
the
archdeacon
nor
his
wife
know
anything
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Slope
's
success
be
henbane
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
's
impropriety
be
as
bad
.
<EOS>
what
would
be
all
the
world
to
Archdeacon
grantly
if
Mr.
Slope
should
become
Dean
of
Barchester
and
marry
his
wife
's
sister
!
<EOS>
He
talk
of
it
and
talk
of
it
till
he
be
nearly
ill
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
grantly
almost
wish
that
the
marriage
be
do
and
over
,
so
that
she
may
hear
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
yet
another
ground
of
misery
which
cut
him
to
the
quick
nearly
as
closely
as
either
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
that
paragon
of
a
clergyman
whom
he
have
bestow
upon
St.
Ewold
's
,
that
college
friend
of
whom
he
have
boast
so
loudly
,
that
ecclesiastical
knight
before
whose
lance
Mr.
Slope
be
to
fall
and
bite
the
dust
,
that
worthy
bulwark
of
the
church
as
it
should
be
,
that
honoured
representative
of
Oxford
's
good
spirit
,
be
 
so
at
least
his
wife
have
tell
him
half
a
dozen
time
 
misconduct
himself
!
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
see
of
Mr.
Arabin
at
plumstead
for
the
last
week
,
but
a
good
deal
have
,
unfortunately
,
be
hear
of
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mrs.
Grantly
have
find
herself
alone
with
the
archdeacon
,
on
the
evening
of
the
Ullathorne
party
,
she
have
express
herself
very
forcibly
as
to
Mr.
Arabin
's
conduct
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
she
declare
,
look
and
act
and
talk
very
unlike
a
decent
parish
clergyman
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
archdeacon
have
laugh
at
this
,
and
assure
her
that
she
nee
not
trouble
herself
 
that
Mr.
Arabin
would
be
find
to
be
quite
safe
.
<EOS>
but
by
degree
he
begin
to
find
that
his
wife
's
eye
have
be
sharp
than
his
own
.
<EOS>
other
people
couple
the
signora
's
name
with
that
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
the
meagre
little
prebendary
who
live
in
the
close
tell
him
to
a
nicety
how
often
Mr.
Arabin
have
visit
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
,
and
how
long
he
have
remain
on
the
occasion
of
each
visit
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
after
Mr.
Arabin
at
the
cathedral
library
,
and
an
officious
little
vicar
choral
have
offer
to
go
and
see
whether
he
could
be
find
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
.
<EOS>
rumour
,
when
she
have
contrive
to
sound
the
first
note
on
her
trumpet
,
soon
make
a
loud
peal
audible
enough
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
clear
that
Mr.
Arabin
have
succumb
to
the
italian
woman
,
and
that
the
archdeacon
's
credit
would
suffer
fearfully
if
something
be
not
do
to
rescue
the
brand
from
the
burning
.
<EOS>
besides
,
to
give
the
archdeacon
his
due
,
he
be
really
attach
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
grieve
greatly
at
his
backsliding
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
sit
,
talk
over
their
sorrow
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
on
the
day
after
Mr.
Slope
's
departure
for
London
,
and
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Mrs.
Grantly
speak
out
her
mind
freely
.
<EOS>
She
have
opinion
of
her
own
about
parish
clergyman
,
and
now
think
it
right
to
give
vent
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
would
have
be
lead
by
me
,
Archdeacon
,
you
would
never
have
put
a
bachelor
into
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
my
dear
,
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
bachelor
clergyman
misbehave
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
clergyman
be
so
much
well
than
other
man
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
with
a
curate
,
whom
you
have
under
your
own
eye
and
whom
you
can
get
rid
of
if
he
persist
in
impropriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
fellow
,

could
not

I
would
have
find
someone
who
could

but
,
my

be
fellow

<EOS>
"
yes

they

<EOS>
I
never
would
put
a
young
man
into
a
living
unless
he
be
married

or
engage
to
be
marry

<EOS>
now
,
here
be
Mr.
Arabin

<EOS>
the
whole
responsibility
lie
upon
you
.

<EOS>
"
there
be
not
at
this
moment
a
clergyman
in
all
Oxford
more
respected
for
moral
and
conduct
than
Arabin

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Oxford
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
lady
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
what
man
choose
to
do
at
Oxford
nobody
ever
hear
of

<EOS>
a
man
may
do
very
well
at
Oxford
who
would
bring
disgrace
on
a
parish
;
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
it
seem
to
me
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
just
such
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
groan
deeply
,
but
he
have
no
further
answer
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
really
must
speak
to
him
,
Archdeacon

<EOS>
only
think
what
the
Thornes
will
say
if
they
hear
that
their
parish
clergyman
spend
his
whole
time
philander
with
this
woman

<EOS>
the
archdeacon
groan
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
courageous
man
,
and
know
well
enough
how
to
rebuke
the
young
clergyman
of
the
diocese
,
when
necessary
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
that
about
Mr.
Arabin
which
make
the
doctor
feel
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
rebuke
him
with
good
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
advise
him
to
find
a
wife
for
himself
,
and
he
will
understand
well
enough
<EOS>
what
that
mean
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
nothing
for
it
but
groan
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mr.
Slope
:
he
be
go
to
be
make
dean
;
he
be
go
to
take
a
wife
;
he
be
about
to
achieve
respectability
and
wealth
,
an
excellent
family
mansion
,
and
a
family
carriage
;
he
would
soon
be
among
the
comfortable
_
élite
_
of
the
ecclesiastical
world
of
Barchester
;
whereas
his
own
_
protégé
_
,
<EOS>
the
true
scion
of
the
true
church
,
by
whom
he
have
swear
,
would
be
still
but
a
poor
vicar
,
and
that
with
a
very
indifferent
character
for
moral
conduct
!
<EOS>
It
may
be
all
very
well
recommend
Mr.
Arabin
to
marry
,
but
how
would
Mr.
Arabin
,
when
married
,
support
a
wife
?
  
<EOS>
thing
be
order
themselves
thus
in
plumstead
drawing
-
room
when
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grantly
be
disturb
in
their
sweet
discourse
by
the
quick
rattle
of
a
carriage
and
pair
of
horse
on
the
gravel
sweep

<EOS>
the
sound
be
not
that

,
whose
private
carriage
be
generally
bring
up
to
country

house

with
demure
propriety
,
but
betoken
rather
the
advent
of
some
person
or
person
who
be
in
a
hurry
to
reach
the
house
,
and
have
no
intention
of
immediately

<EOS>
guest
invite
to
stay
a
week
,
and
who
be
conscious
of
arrive
after
the
first
dinner
-
bell
,
would
probably
approach
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
so
may
arrive
an
attorney
with

of
a

death
,
or
a
son
from
college
with
all
the
fresh

<EOS>
no

would
have
have
himself
drive
up

of
a
country

house
in
such
a
manner
who
have
the
slight

chaise
with
a
couple

evidently
full

His

rarely

which
he

without
much

He

well

the

be
some
consolation

so
be
I

Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
would
give
twenty
pound
,
"

the
archdeacon
,
"
to
see
how
Mr.

will
look
when
he
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Mr.
Slope
's
discomfiture
form
no
small
part
of
the
archdeacon
's
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Mr.
Harding
be
allow
to
go
upstairs
and
wash
his
hand
,
have
,
in
fact
,
say
very
little
of
all
that
he
have
come
out
to
plumstead
on
purpose
to
say
.
<EOS>
nor
could
anything
more
be
say
till
the
servant
be
go
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
joy
of
Dr.
Grantly
be
so
uncontrollable
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
call
his
father
-
in
-
law
Mr.
Dean
before
the
man
,
and
therefore
it
be
soon
matter
of
discussion
in
the
low
region
how
Mr.
Harding
,
instead
of
his
daughter
's
future
husband
,
be
to
be
the
new
dean
,
and
various
be
the
opinion
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
cook
and
butler
,
who
be
advance
in
year
,
think
that
it
be
just
as
it
should
be
;
but
the
footman
and
lady
's
maid
,
who
be
young
,
think
it
be
a
great
shame
that
Mr.
Slope
should
lose
his
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
mean
chap
all
the
same
,
"
say
the
footman
,
"
and
it
an't
along
of
him
that
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
I
always
do
admire
the
missus
's
sister
;
and
she
would
well
become
the
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
these
be
the
idea
downstairs
,
a
very
great
difference
of
opinion
exist
above
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
cloth
be
draw
and
the
wine
on
the
table
,
Mr.
Harding
make
for
himself
an
opportunity
of
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
with
much
inward
troubling
that
he
say
:
  
"
It
be
very
kind
of
Lord
 
---
,
very
kind
,
and
I
feel
it
deeply
,
most
deeply
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
I
must
confess
,
gratify
by
the
offer
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
all
the
same
I
be
afraid
that
I
can
not
accept
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
decanter
almost
fall
from
the
archdeacon
's
hand
upon
the
table
,
and
the
start
he
make
be
so
great
as
to
make
his
wife
jump
up
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
not
accept
the
deanship
!
<EOS>
if
it
really
end
in
this
,
there
would
be
no
longer
any
doubt
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
be
demente
.
<EOS>
the
question
now
be
whether
a
clergyman
with
low
rank
and
preferment
amount
to
less
than
£
200
a
year
should
accept
high
rank
,
£
1,200
a
year
,
and
one
of
the
most
desirable
position
which
his
profession
have
to
afford
!
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
gasp
for
breath
and
stare
at
his
guest
as
though
the
violence
of
his
emotion
have
almost
throw
him
into
a
fit
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
find
myself
fit
for
new
duty
,
"
urge
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
new
duty
!
<EOS>
what
duty
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
archdeacon
with
unintended
sarcasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Papa
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
,
"
nothing
can
be
easy
than
what
a
dean
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
surely
you
be
more
active
than
Dr.
Trefoil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
have
half
as
much
to
do

as
he
have
at

Dr.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
what
"
the
Jupiter
"
say
the
other
day
about
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
I
see
that
"
the
Jupiter
"
say
all
that
it
could
to
induce
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
would
wish
to
see
Mr.
Slope
make
dean
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
make
no
reply
to
this
rebuke
,
though
he
feel
it
strongly
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
come
over
to
plumstead
to
have
further
contention
with
his
son
-
in
-
law
about
Mr.
Slope
,
so
he
allow
it
to
pass
by
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
can
not
make
you
understand
my
feeling
,
"
he
say
,
"
for
we
have
be
cast
in
different
mould
.
<EOS>
I
may
wish
that
I
have
your
spirit
and
energy
and
power
of
combat
;
but
I
have
not

<EOS>
every
day
that
be
add
to
my

increase
my

where
on

can
a

have
peace

rest

it

impossible
that
I
should
make
you
understand
my
feeling

nor
do
I
pretend

any
great
virtue
in
the
matter

<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
want
the
force
of
character
which
may
enable
me
to
stand
against
the
spirit
of
the
time

<EOS>
the
call
on
all
side
now
be
for
young
man

I
have
not
the
nerve
to
put
myself
in
opposition

the
demand

be
"
the

"
<EOS>
when
it
hear
of
my
appointment
,
to
write
article
after
article
set
forth
my
incompetency
,
I
be
sure
it
would
cost
me
my
reason

<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
able
to
bear
with
such
thing
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
I
own
that
I
ought
.
<EOS>
but
I
feel
my
weakness
,
and
I
know
that
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
know
no
more
than
a
child
what
the
dean
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!

exclaim
the
archdeacon

do

you

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
dreadful
blow
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
possibly
have
suit
him
better
than
have
Mr.
Harding
in
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
never
look
down
on
Mr.
Harding
on
account
of
his
recent
poverty
,
he
do
fully
recognize
the
satisfaction
of
have
those
belong
to
him
in
comfortable
position
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
more
suitable
that
Mr.
Harding
should
be
Dean
of
Barchester
than
vicar
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
and
precentor
to
boot
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
great
discomfiture
of
that
arch
-
enemy
of
all
that
be
respectable
in
Barchester
,
of
that
new
Low
Church
clerical
parvenu
that
have
fall
amongst
them
,
that
alone
would
be
worth
more
,
almost
,
than
the
situation
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
frightful
to
think
that
such
unhoped
-
for
good
fortune
should
be
mar
by
the
absurd
crotchet
and
unwholesome
hallucination
by
which
Mr.
Harding
allow
himself
to
be
lead
astray
.
<EOS>
to
have
the
cup
so
near
his
lip
and
then
to
lose
the
drinking
of
it
be
more
than
Dr.
grantly
could
endure
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
it
appear
as
though
he
would
have
to
endure
it
.
<EOS>
in
vain
he
threaten
and
in
vain
he
coax
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
do
not
indeed
speak
with
perfect
decision
of
refuse
the
proffer
glory
,
but
he
would
not
speak
with
anything
like
decision
of
accept
it
.
<EOS>
when
press
again
and
again
,
he
would
again
and
again
allege
that
he
be
wholly
unfitted
to
new
duty
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
the
archdeacon
try
to
insinuate
,
though
he
could
not
plainly
declare
,
that
there
be
no
new
duty
to
perform
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
he
hint
that
in
all
case
of
difficulty
he
,
he
the
archdeacon
,
be
willing
and
able
to
guide
a
weak
-
minded
dean
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
seem
to
have
a
foolish
idea
,
not
only
that
there
be
new
duty
to
do
,
but
that
no
one
should
accept
the
place
who
be
not
himself
prepared
to
do
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
conference
end
in
an
understanding
that
Mr.
Harding
should
at
once
acknowledge
the
letter
he
have
receive
from
the
minister
's
private
secretary
,
and
should
beg
that
he
may
be
allow
two
day
to
make
up
his
mind
;
and
that
during
those
two
day
the
matter
should
be
consider
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
the
archdeacon
be
to
drive
Mr.
Harding
back
to
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
show
Her
talent
at
match
-
making
 
<EOS>
on
Mr.
Harding
's
return
to
Barchester
from
Plumstead
,
which
be
effect
by
him
in
due
course
in
company
with
the
archdeacon
,
more
tiding
of
a
surprising
nature
meet
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
during
the
journey
,
subject
to
such
a
weight
of
unanswerable
argument
,
all
of
which
go
to
prove
that
it
be
his
bounden
duty
not
to
interfere
with
the
paternal
Government
that
be
so
anxious
to
make
him
a
dean
,
that
when
he
arrive
at
the
chemist
's
door
in
High
Street
,
he
hardly
know
which
way
to
turn
himself
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
but
,
perplex
as
he
be
,
he
be
doom
to
further
perplexity
.
<EOS>
He
find
a
note
there
from
his
daughter
beg
him
most
urgently
to
come
to
her
immediately
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
again
go
back
a
little
in
our
story
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
have
not
be
slow
to
hear
the
rumour
respect
Mr.
Arabin
which
have
so
much
disturb
the
happiness
of
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
and
she
,
also
,
be
unhappy
to
think
that
her
parish
clergyman
should
be
accuse
of
worship
a
strange
goddess
.
<EOS>
She
,
also
,
be
of
opinion
that
rector
and
vicar
should
all
be
married
,
and
with
that
good
-
natured
energy
which
be
characteristic
of
her
,
she
put
her
wit
to
work
to
find
a
fitting
match
for
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
in
this
difficulty
,
could
think
of
no
well
remedy
than
a
lecture
from
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
think
that
a
young
lady
,
marriageable
and
with
a
dowry
,
may
be
of
more
efficacy
.
<EOS>
in
look
through
the
catalogue
of
her
unmarried
friend
who
may
possibly
be
in
want
of
a
husband
,
and
may
also
be
fit
for
such
promotion
as
a
country
parsonage
afford
,
she
could
think
of
no
one
more
eligible
than
Mrs.
Bold
;
consequently
,
lose
no
time
,
she
go
into
Barchester
on
the
day
of
Mr.
Slope
's
discomfiture
,
the
same
day
that
her
brother
have
have
his
interesting
interview
with
the
last
of
the
Neros
,
and
invite
Mrs.
Bold
to
bring
her
nurse
and
baby
to
Ullathorne
and
make
them
a
protract
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
suggest
a
month
or
two
,
intend
to
use
her
influence
afterwards
in
prolong
it
so
as
to
last
out
the
winter
,
in
order
that
Mr.
Arabin
may
have
an
opportunity
of
become
fairly
intimate
with
his
intend
bride
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
have
Mr.
Arabin
,
too
,
"
say
Miss
Thorne
to
herself
;
"
and
before
the
spring
they
will
know
each
other
;
and
in
twelve
or
eighteen
month
"
time
,
if
all
go
well
,
Mrs.
Bold
will
be
domicile
at
St.
Ewold
's
;
"
and
then
the
kind
-
hearted
lady
give
herself
some
not
undeserved
praise
for
her
match
-
make
genius
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
take
a
little
by
surprise
,
but
the
matter
end
in
her
promising
to
go
to
Ullathorne
for
at
any
rate
a
week
or
two
;
on
the
day
previous
to
that
on
which
her
father
drive
out
to
Plumstead
,
she
have
have
herself
drive
out
to
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
would
not
perplex
her
with
her
embryo
lord
on
that
same
evening
,
think
that
she
would
allow
her
a
few
hour
to
make
herself
at
home
;
but
on
the
follow
morning
Mr.
Arabin
arrive
.
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
say
Miss
Thorne
to
herself
,
"
I
must
contrive
to
throw
them
in
each
other
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
same
day
,
after
dinner
,
Eleanor
,
with
an
assumed
air
of
dignity
which
she
could
not
maintain
,
with
tear
which
she
could
not
suppress
,
with
a
flutter
which
she
could
not
conquer
,
and
a
joy
which
she
could
not
hide
,
tell
Miss
Thorne
that
she
be
engage
to
marry
Mr.
Arabin
and
that
it
behove
her
to
get
back
home
to
Barchester
as
quick
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
simply
that
Miss
Thorne
be
rejoice
at
the
success
of
the
scheme
would
give
a
very
faint
idea
of
her
feeling
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
My
reader
may
probably
have
dreamt
before
now
that
they
have
have
before
them
some
terribly
long
walk
to
accomplish
,
some
journey
of
twenty
or
thirty
mile
,
an
amount
of
labour
frightful
to
anticipate
,
and
that
immediately
on
start
they
have
ingeniously
find
some
accommodate
short
cut
which
have
bring
them
without
fatigue
to
their
work
's
end
in
five
minute
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
waking
feeling
be
somewhat
of
the
same
nature
.
<EOS>
My
reader
may
perhaps
have
have
to
do
with
child
,
and
may
on
some
occasion
have
promise
to
their
young
charge
some
great
gratification
intend
to
come
off
,
perhaps
at
the
end
of
the
winter
,
or
at
the
beginning
of
summer
.
<EOS>
the
impatient
juvenile
,
however
,
will
not
wait
,
and
clamorously
demand
their
treat
before
they
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
her
child
be
equally
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
She
be
like
an
inexperienced
gunner
,
who
have
ill
-
calculate
the
length
of
the
train
that
he
have
lay
.
<EOS>
the
gun
-
powder
explode
much
too
soon
,
and
poor
Miss
Thorne
feel
that
she
be
blow
up
by
the
strength
of
her
own
petard
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
have
have
lover
of
her
own
,
but
they
have
be
gentleman
of
old
-
fashioned
and
deliberate
habit
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
heart
also
have
not
always
be
hard
,
though
she
be
still
a
virgin
spinster
;
but
it
have
never
yield
in
this
way
at
the
first
assault
.
<EOS>
She
have
intend
to
bring
together
a
middle
-
aged
,
studious
clergyman
and
a
discreet
matron
who
may
possibly
be
induce
to
marry
again
,
and
in
do
so
she
have
throw
fire
among
tinder
.
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
all
as
it
should
be
,
but
she
do
feel
perhaps
a
little
put
out
by
the
precipitancy
of
her
own
success
,
and
perhaps
a
little
vexed
at
the
readiness
of
Mrs.
Bold
to
be
woo
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
,
however
,
nothing
about
it
to
anyone
,
and
ascribe
it
all
to
the
altered
manner
of
the
new
age
.
<EOS>
Their
mother
and
grandmother
be
perhaps
a
little
more
deliberate
,
but
it
be
admit
on
all
side
that
thing
be
conduct
very
differently
now
than
in
former
time
.
<EOS>
for
aught
Miss
Thorne
know
of
the
matter
,
a
couple
of
hour
may
be
quite
sufficient
under
the
new
régime
to
complete
that
for
which
she
in
her
ignorance
have
allot
twelve
month
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
must
not
pass
over
the
wooing
so
cavalierly
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
tell
,
with
perhaps
tedious
accuracy
,
how
Eleanor
dispose
of
two
of
her
lover
at
Ullathorne
;
and
it
must
also
be
tell
with
equal
accuracy
,
and
if
possible
with
less
tedium
,
how
she
encounter
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
deny
that
when
Eleanor
accept
Miss
Thorne
's
invitation
she
remember
that
Ullathorne
be
in
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
since
her
interview
with
the
signora
she
have
do
little
else
than
think
about
Mr.
Arabin
and
the
appeal
that
have
be
make
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
,
or
try
to
bring
herself
to
believe
,
that
what
she
have
be
tell
be
untrue
.
<EOS>
think
of
it
how
she
would
,
she
could
not
but
accept
it
as
a
fact
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
fond
of
her
;
and
then
when
she
go
further
and
ask
herself
the
question
,
she
could
not
but
accept
it
as
a
fact
also
that
she
be
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
destine
for
her
to
be
the
partner
of
his
hope
and
sorrow
,
to
whom
could
she
look
for
friendship
so
properly
as
to
Miss
Thorne
?
<EOS>
this
invitation
be
like
an
ordained
step
towards
the
fulfilment
of
her
destiny
,
and
when
she
also
hear
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
expect
to
be
at
Ullathorne
on
the
follow
day
,
it
seem
as
though
all
the
world
be
conspire
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
well
,
do
she
not
deserve
it
?
<EOS>
in
that
affair
of
Mr.
Slope
have
not
all
the
world
conspire
against
her
?
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
however
,
make
herself
easy
and
at
home
.
<EOS>
when
,
in
the
evening
after
dinner
,
Miss
Thorne
expatiate
on
the
excellence
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
quality
,
and
hint
that
any
little
rumour
which
may
be
ill
-
naturedly
spread
abroad
concern
him
really
mean
nothing
,
Mrs.
Bold
find
herself
unable
to
answer
.
<EOS>
when
Miss
Thorne
go
a
little
further
and
declare
that
she
do
not
know
a
pretty
vicarage
-
house
in
the
county
than
St.
Ewold
's
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
remember
the
project
bow
-
window
and
the
project
priestess
,
still
hold
her
tongue
,
though
her
ear
tingle
with
the
conviction
that
all
the
world
know
that
she
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
well
,
what
would
that
matter
if
they
could
only
meet
and
tell
each
other
what
each
now
long
to
tell
?
  
<EOS>
and
they
do
meet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
come
early
in
the
day
and
find
the
two
lady
together
at
work
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
,
who
,
have
she
know
all
the
truth
,
would
have
vanish
into
air
at
once
,
have
no
conception
that
her
immediate
absence
would
be
a
blessing
,
and
remain
chat
with
them
till
luncheon
-
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
could
talk
about
nothing
but
the
Signora
Neroni
's
beauty
,
would
discuss
no
people
but
the
Stanhopes
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
distressing
to
Eleanor
and
not
very
satisfactory
to
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
but
yet
there
be
evidence
of
innocence
in
his
open
avowal
of
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
they
have
lunch
,
and
then
Mr.
Arabin
go
out
on
parish
duty
,
and
Eleanor
and
Miss
Thorne
be
leave
to
take
a
walk
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
the
Signora
Neroni
be
so
lovely
as
people
say
?
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
ask
as
they
be
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
beautiful
,
certainly
,
very
beautiful
,
"
Miss
Thorne
answer
;
"
but
I
do
not
know
that
anyone
consider
her
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
all
man
would
like
to
look
at
,
but
few
,
I
imagine
,
would
be
glad
to
take
her
to
their
hearth
,
<EOS>
even
be
she
unmarried
and
not
afflict
as
she
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
little
comfort
in
this
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
make
the
most
of
it
till
she
get
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
leave
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
just
as
it
be
get
dark
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
afternoon
in
the
beginning
of
October
,
and
Eleanor
be
sit
in
the
window
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
last
daylight
for
her
novel
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fire
in
the
comfortable
room
,
but
the
weather
be
not
cold
enough
to
make
it
attractive
;
and
as
she
could
see
the
sun
set
from
where
she
sit
,
she
be
not
very
attentive
to
her
book
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
when
he
enter
,
stand
awhile
with
his
back
to
the
fire
in
his
usual
way
,
merely
utter
a
few
commonplace
remark
about
the
beauty
of
the
weather
,
while
he
pluck
up
courage
for
more
interesting
converse
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
probably
be
say
that
he
have
resolve
then
and
there
to
make
an
offer
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
man
,
we
believe
,
seldom
make
such
resolve
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
and
Mr.
Stanhope
have
do
so
,
it
be
true
,
but
gentleman
generally
propose
without
any
absolutely
define
determination
as
to
their
doing
so
.
<EOS>
such
be
now
the
case
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
lovely
sunset
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
answer
him
on
the
dreadfully
trite
subject
which
he
have
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
could
not
see
the
sunset
from
the
hearth
-
rug
,
so
he
have
to
go
close
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
lovely
,
"
say
he
,
stand
modestly
so
far
away
from
her
as
to
avoid
touch
the
flounce
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
then
it
appear
that
he
have
nothing
further
to
say
;
so
,
after
gaze
for
a
moment
in
silence
at
the
brightness
of
the
set
sun
,
he
return
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
find
that
it
be
quite
impossible
for
herself
to
commence
a
conversation
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
;
word
,
which
be
generally
plenty
enough
with
her
,
would
not
come
to
her
relief
.
<EOS>
and
moreover
,
do
what
she
would
,
she
could
hardly
prevent
herself
from
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
like
Ullathorne
?
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
,
speak
from
the
safely
distant
position
which
he
have
assume
on
the
hearth
-
rug
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
very
much
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
like
them
 
<EOS>
but
the
style
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
about
old
-
fashioned
mansion
,
build
as
this
be
,
and
old
-
fashioned
garden
,
that
to
me
be
especially
delightful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
everything
old
-
fashioned
,
"
say
Eleanor
;
<EOS>
"
old
-
fashioned
thing
be
so
much
the
honest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
,
gently
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
an
opinion
on
which
very
much
may
be
say
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
how
widely
the
world
be
divide
on
a
subject
which
so
nearly
concern
us
all
,
and
which
be
so
close
beneath
our
eye
.
<EOS>
some
think
that
we
be
quickly
progress
towards
perfection
,
while
other
imagine
that
virtue
be
disappear
from
the
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
what
do
you
think
?
"
say
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
feel
somewhat
surprised
at
the
tone
which
his
conversation
be
take
,
and
yet
she
be
relieve
at
his
say
something
which
enable
herself
to
speak
without
show
her
own
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
think
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
rumble
his
money
with
his
hand
in
his
trouser
pocket
,
and
look
and
speak
very
little
like
a
thriving
lover
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
bane
of
my
life
that
on
important
subject
I
acquire
no
fix
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
and
think
,
and
go
on
thinking
,
<EOS>
and
yet
my
thought
be
run
ever
in
different
direction
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
whether
or
no
we
do
lean
more
confidently
than
our
father
do
on
those
high
hope
to
which
we
profess
to
aspire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
world
grow
more
worldly
every
day
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
because
you
see
more
of
it
than
when
you
be
young
.
<EOS>
but
we
should
hardly
judge
by
what
we
see
 
<EOS>
we
see
so
very
,
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
there
be
then
a
pause
for
awhile
,
during
which
Mr.
Arabin
continue
to
turn
over
his
shilling
and
half
-
crown
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
believe
in
scripture
,
we
can
hardly
think
that
mankind
in
general
will
now
be
allow
to
retrograde
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
whose
mind
be
certainly
engage
otherwise
than
on
the
general
state
of
mankind
,
make
no
answer
to
this
.
<EOS>
She
feel
thoroughly
dissatisfied
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
force
her
thought
away
from
the
topic
on
which
the
signora
have
speak
to
her
in
so
strange
a
way
,
and
yet
she
know
that
she
could
not
converse
with
Mr.
Arabin
in
an
unrestrained
,
natural
tone
till
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
anxious
not
to
show
to
him
any
special
emotion
,
and
yet
she
feel
that
if
he
look
at
her
,
he
would
at
once
see
that
she
be
not
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
instead
of
do
so
,
he
leave
the
fire
-
place
and
begin
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
take
up
her
book
resolutely
,
but
she
could
not
read
,
for
there
be
a
tear
in
her
eye
,
and
do
what
she
would
,
it
fall
on
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Arabin
's
back
be
turn
to
her
,
she
wipe
it
away
;
but
another
be
soon
course
down
her
face
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
They
would
come
 
not
a
deluge
of
tear
that
would
have
betray
her
at
once
,
but
one
by
one
,
single
monitor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
do
not
observe
her
closely
,
and
they
pass
unseen
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
thus
pace
up
and
down
the
room
,
take
four
or
five
turn
before
he
speak
another
word
,
and
Eleanor
sit
equally
silent
with
her
face
bent
over
her
book
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
that
her
tear
would
get
the
well
of
her
,
and
be
prepare
for
an
escape
from
the
room
,
when
Mr.
Arabin
in
his
walk
stand
opposite
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
come
close
up
but
stand
exactly
on
the
spot
to
which
his
course
bring
him
,
and
then
,
with
his
hand
under
his
coat
-
tail
,
thus
make
his
confession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
owe
you
retribution
for
a
great
offence
of
which
I
have
be
guilty
towards
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
heart
beat
so
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
say
that
he
have
never
be
guilty
of
any
offence
.
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Arabin
thus
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
much
of
it
since
,
and
I
be
now
aware
that
I
be
wholly
unwarranted
in
put
to
you
a
question
which
I
once
ask
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
indelicate
on
my
part
,
and
perhaps
unmanly
.
<EOS>
no
intimacy
which
may
exist
between
myself
and
your
connexion
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
could
justify
it
.
<EOS>
nor
could
the
acquaintance
which
exist
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
this
word
acquaintance
strike
cold
on
Eleanor
's
heart
.
<EOS>
be
this
to
be
her
doom
after
all
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
therefore
think
it
right
to
beg
your
pardon
in
a
humble
spirit
,
and
I
now
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
Eleanor
to
say
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
much
because
she
be
cry
,
and
yet
she
must
say
something
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
anxious
to
say
that
something
graciously
,
kindly
,
and
yet
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
betray
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
feel
herself
so
much
at
a
loss
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
take
no
offence
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
you
do
!
<EOS>
and
have
you
not
do
so
,
you
would
not
have
be
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
be
as
right
to
be
offend
as
I
be
wrong
so
to
offend
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgive
myself
,
but
I
hope
to
hear
that
you
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
now
past
speak
calmly
,
though
she
still
continue
to
hide
her
tear
;
and
Mr.
Arabin
,
after
pause
a
moment
in
vain
for
her
reply
,
be
walk
off
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
could
not
allow
him
to
go
unanswered
without
grievously
sin
against
all
charity
;
so
,
rise
from
her
seat
,
she
gently
touch
his
arm
and
say
,
"
oh
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
do
not
go
till
I
speak
to
you
!
<EOS>
I
do
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
forgive
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
the
hand
that
have
so
gently
touch
his
arm
and
then
gaze
into
her
face
as
if
he
would
peruse
there
,
as
though
write
in
a
book
,
the
whole
future
destiny
of
his
life
;
as
he
do
so
,
there
be
a
sober
,
sad
seriousness
in
his
own
countenance
which
Eleanor
find
herself
unable
to
sustain
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
look
down
upon
the
carpet
,
let
her
tear
trickle
as
they
would
,
and
leave
her
hand
within
his
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
for
a
minute
that
they
stand
so
,
but
the
duration
of
that
minute
be
sufficient
to
make
it
ever
memorable
to
them
both
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
sure
now
that
she
be
love
.
<EOS>
no
word
,
be
their
eloquence
what
it
may
,
could
be
more
impressive
than
that
eager
,
melancholy
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
why
do
he
look
so
into
her
eye
?
<EOS>
why
do
he
not
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
look
for
her
to
make
the
first
sign
?
  
<EOS>
and
he
,
though
he
know
but
little
of
woman
,
even
he
know
that
he
be
love
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
to
ask
,
and
it
would
be
all
his
own
,
that
inexpressible
loveliness
,
those
ever
-
speak
but
yet
now
mute
eye
,
that
feminine
brightness
and
eager
,
love
spirit
which
have
so
attract
him
since
first
he
have
encounter
it
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
must
,
all
be
his
own
now
.
<EOS>
on
no
other
supposition
be
it
possible
that
she
should
allow
her
hand
to
remain
thus
clasped
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
to
ask
.
<EOS>
ah
,
but
that
be
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
do
a
minute
suffice
for
all
this
?
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
it
may
be
more
than
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
 
<EOS>
"
at
last
he
say
and
then
stop
himself
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
could
not
speak
,
how
be
she
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
He
have
call
her
by
her
name
,
the
same
name
that
any
mere
stranger
would
have
use
!
<EOS>
She
withdraw
her
hand
from
his
and
move
as
though
to
return
to
her
seat
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
!
"
<EOS>
he
then
say
in
his
softest
tone
,
as
though
the
courage
of
a
lover
be
as
yet
but
half
-
assume
,
as
though
he
be
still
afraid
of
give
offence
by
the
freedom
which
he
take
.
<EOS>
She
look
slowly
,
gently
,
almost
piteously
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
at
any
rate
no
anger
there
to
deter
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
!
"
<EOS>
he
again
exclaim
,
and
in
a
moment
he
have
her
clasp
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
how
this
be
do
,
whether
the
doing
be
with
him
or
her
,
whether
she
have
fly
thither
conquer
by
the
tenderness
of
his
voice
,
or
he
with
a
violence
not
likely
to
give
offence
have
draw
her
to
his
breast
,
neither
of
them
know
;
nor
can
I
declare
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
that
sympathy
between
them
which
hardly
admit
of
individual
motion
.
<EOS>
They
be
one
and
the
same
 
one
flesh
 
<EOS>
one
spirit
 
one
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
my
own
Eleanor
,
my
own
,
my
wife
!
"
She
venture
to
look
up
at
him
through
her
tear
,
and
he
,
bow
his
face
down
over
her
,
press
his
lip
upon
her
brow
 
his
virgin
lip
,
which
,
since
a
beard
first
grow
upon
his
chin
,
have
never
yet
taste
the
luxury
of
a
woman
's
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
tell
that
her
yea
must
be
yea
,
or
her
nay
,
nay
,
but
she
be
call
on
for
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
tell
Miss
Thorne
that
she
be
engage
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
but
no
such
word
have
pass
between
them
,
<EOS>
no
promise
have
be
ask
or
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
me
go
,
"
say
she
,
"
let
me
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
happy
to
remain
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
,
that
I
may
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
try
to
hinder
her
;
he
do
not
repeat
the
kiss
;
he
do
not
press
another
on
her
lip
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
do
so
,
have
he
be
so
minded
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
arm
from
round
her
waist
,
his
arm
that
be
tremble
with
a
new
delight
,
and
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
She
flee
like
a
roe
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
then
,
have
turn
the
bolt
,
she
enjoy
the
full
luxury
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
idolise
,
almost
worship
this
man
who
have
so
meekly
beg
her
pardon
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
now
her
own
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
she
weep
and
cry
and
laugh
as
the
hope
and
fear
and
misery
of
the
last
few
week
pass
in
remembrance
through
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
that
anyone
should
have
dare
to
think
that
she
who
have
be
choose
by
him
could
possibly
have
mate
herself
with
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
that
they
should
have
dare
to
tell
him
,
also
,
and
subject
her
bright
happiness
to
such
needless
risk
!
<EOS>
and
then
she
smile
with
joy
as
she
think
of
all
the
comfort
that
she
could
give
him
 
not
that
he
care
for
comfort
,
but
that
it
would
be
so
delicious
for
her
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
She
get
up
and
ring
for
her
maid
that
she
may
tell
her
little
boy
of
his
new
father
,
and
in
her
own
way
she
do
tell
him
.
<EOS>
She
desire
her
maid
to
leave
her
,
in
order
that
she
may
be
alone
with
her
child
;
and
then
,
while
he
lie
sprawl
on
the
bed
,
she
pour
forth
the
praise
,
all
unmeaning
to
him
,
of
the
man
she
have
select
to
guard
his
infancy
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
happy
,
however
,
till
she
have
make
Mr.
Arabin
take
the
child
to
himself
and
thus
,
as
it
be
,
adopt
him
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
moment
the
idea
strike
her
<EOS>
she
take
the
baby
up
in
her
arm
and
,
open
her
door
,
run
quickly
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
find
,
by
his
step
still
pace
on
the
floor
,
that
he
be
there
,
and
a
glance
within
the
room
tell
her
that
he
be
alone
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
a
moment
and
then
hurry
in
with
her
precious
charge
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
meet
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
she
,
breathless
with
her
haste
;
"
there
,
take
him
 
take
him
,
and
love
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
take
the
little
fellow
from
her
and
,
kiss
him
again
and
again
,
pray
God
to
bless
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
shall
be
all
as
my
own
 
all
as
my
own

"
say
he
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
as
she
stoop
to
take
back
her
child
,
kiss
the
hand
that
hold
him
and
then
rush
back
with
her
treasure
to
her
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Mr.
Harding
's
young
daughter
be
win
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
at
dinner
neither
she
nor
Mr.
Arabin
be
very
bright
,
but
their
silence
occasion
no
remark
.
<EOS>
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
as
we
have
before
say
,
she
tell
Miss
Thorne
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
return
to
Barchester
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
go
over
with
his
budget
of
news
to
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
as
Doctor
Grantly
be
not
there
,
he
could
only
satisfy
himself
by
tell
Mrs.
grantly
how
that
he
intend
himself
the
honour
of
become
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
in
the
ecstasy
of
her
joy
at
hear
such
tiding
Mrs.
grantly
vouchsafe
him
a
warm
welcome
than
any
he
have
yet
receive
from
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
 
it
be
the
general
exclamation
of
the
rectory
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
dear
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
what
a
monstrous
injustice
have
be
do
her
!
<EOS>
well
,
it
shall
all
be
make
up
now
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
think
of
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
what
lie
people
tell
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
but
people
in
this
matter
have
tell
no
lie
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
the
Beelzebub
Colt
 
<EOS>
when
Miss
Thorne
leave
the
dining
-
room
,
Eleanor
have
form
no
intention
of
reveal
to
her
what
have
occur
,
but
when
she
be
seat
beside
her
hostess
on
the
sofa
,
the
secret
drop
from
her
almost
unawares
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
but
a
bad
hypocrite
,
and
she
find
herself
quite
unable
to
continue
talk
about
Mr.
Arabin
as
though
he
be
a
stranger
while
her
heart
be
full
of
him
.
<EOS>
when
Miss
Thorne
,
pursue
her
own
scheme
with
discreet
zeal
,
ask
the
young
widow
whether
,
in
her
opinion
,
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
for
Mr.
Arabin
to
get
marry
,
she
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
confess
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
would
,
"
say
Eleanor
rather
sheepishly
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Miss
Thorne
amplify
on
the
idea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Miss
Thorne
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
he
be
go
to
be
marry
:
I
be
engage
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
Miss
Thorne
know
very
well
that
there
have
be
no
such
engagement
when
she
have
be
walk
with
Mrs.
Bold
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
She
have
also
hear
enough
to
be
tolerably
sure
that
there
have
be
no
preliminary
to
such
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
therefore
,
as
we
have
before
describe
,
take
a
little
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
,
she
embrace
her
guest
and
cordially
congratulate
her
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
no
opportunity
of
speak
another
word
to
Mr.
Arabin
that
evening
,
except
such
word
as
all
the
world
may
hear
;
and
these
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
be
few
enough
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
do
her
good
to
leave
them
in
privacy
,
but
Mr.
Thorne
,
who
know
nothing
of
what
have
occur
,
and
another
guest
,
a
friend
of
his
,
entirely
interfere
with
her
good
intention
.
<EOS>
so
poor
Eleanor
have
to
go
to
bed
without
one
sign
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Her
state
,
nevertheless
,
be
not
to
be
pity
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
be
up
early
.
<EOS>
It
be
probable
,
she
think
,
that
by
go
down
a
little
before
the
usual
hour
of
breakfast
she
may
find
Mr.
Arabin
alone
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
that
he
also
would
calculate
that
an
interview
would
thus
be
possible
?
<EOS>
thus
think
,
Eleanor
be
dress
a
full
hour
before
the
time
fix
in
the
ullathorne
household
for
morning
prayer
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
at
once
go
down
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
to
seem
to
be
too
anxious
to
meet
her
lover
,
though
heaven
know
her
anxiety
be
intense
enough
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
sit
herself
down
at
her
window
,
and
repeatedly
look
at
her
watch
,
nurse
her
child
till
she
think
she
may
venture
forth
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
find
herself
at
the
dining
-
room
door
,
she
stand
a
moment
,
hesitate
to
turn
the
handle
;
but
when
she
hear
Mr.
Thorne
's
voice
inside
she
hesitate
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Her
object
be
defeat
,
and
she
may
now
go
in
as
soon
as
she
like
without
the
slight
imputation
on
her
delicacy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
and
Mr.
Arabin
be
stand
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
discuss
the
merit
of
the
Beelzebub
colt
;
or
rather
,
Mr.
Thorne
be
discuss
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
be
listen
.
<EOS>
that
interesting
animal
have
rub
the
stump
of
his
tail
against
the
wall
of
his
stable
and
occasion
much
uneasiness
to
the
ullathorne
master
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
have
Eleanor
but
wait
another
minute
,
Mr.
Thorne
would
have
be
in
the
stable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
when
he
see
his
lady
guest
,
repress
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
the
Beelzebub
colt
must
do
without
him
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
three
stand
,
say
little
or
nothing
to
each
other
,
till
at
last
the
master
of
the
house
,
find
that
he
could
no
longer
bear
his
present
state
of
suspense
respect
his
favourite
young
steed
,
make
an
elaborate
apology
to
Mrs.
Bold
and
escape
.
<EOS>
as
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
<EOS>
Eleanor
almost
wish
that
he
have
remain
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
she
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Arabin
,
but
she
hardly
yet
know
how
to
address
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
soon
relieve
her
from
her
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
her
,
and
take
both
her
hand
in
his
,
he
say
,
"
so
,
Eleanor
,
you
and
I
be
to
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
be
it
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
up
into
his
face
,
and
her
lip
form
themselves
into
a
single
syllable
.
<EOS>
She
utter
no
sound
,
but
he
could
read
the
affirmative
plainly
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
trust
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
very
great
trust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
 
it
be
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
not
exactly
take
what
he
have
say
in
the
sense
that
he
have
mean
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
,
very
great
trust
,
and
I
will
do
my
utmost
to
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
also
will
do
my
utmost
to
deserve
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Arabin
very
solemnly
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
wind
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
he
stand
there
gaze
at
the
fire
,
and
she
,
with
her
head
lean
on
his
shoulder
,
stand
by
him
,
well
satisfied
with
her
position
.
<EOS>
They
neither
of
them
speak
,
or
find
any
want
of
speak
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
needful
for
them
to
say
have
be
say
.
<EOS>
the
yea
,
yea
,
have
be
speak
by
Eleanor
in
her
own
way
 
and
that
way
have
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
it
remain
to
them
each
to
enjoy
the
assurance
of
the
other
's
love
.
<EOS>
and
how
great
that
luxury
be
!
<EOS>
how
far
it
surpass
any
other
pleasure
which
God
have
allow
to
his
creature
!
<EOS>
and
to
a
woman
's
heart
how
doubly
delightful
!
  
<EOS>
when
the
ivy
have
find
its
tower
,
when
the
delicate
creeper
have
find
its
strong
wall
,
we
know
how
the
parasite
plant
grow
and
prosper
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
create
to
stretch
forth
their
branch
alone
,
and
endure
without
protection
the
summer
's
sun
and
the
winter
's
storm
.
<EOS>
alone
<EOS>
they
but
spread
themselves
on
the
ground
and
cower
unseen
in
the
dingy
shade
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
have
find
their
firm
supporter
,
how
wonderful
be
their
beauty
;
how
all
-
pervading
and
victorious
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
turret
without
its
ivy
,
or
the
high
garden
wall
without
the
jasmine
which
give
it
its
beauty
and
fragrance
?
<EOS>
the
hedge
without
the
honeysuckle
be
but
a
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
feeling
still
half
-
exist
,
but
now
half
-
conquer
by
the
force
of
human
nature
,
that
a
woman
should
be
ashamed
of
her
love
till
the
husband
's
right
to
her
compel
her
to
acknowledge
it
.
<EOS>
We
would
fain
preach
a
different
doctrine
.
<EOS>
a
woman
should
glory
in
her
love
,
but
on
that
account
let
her
take
the
more
care
that
it
be
such
as
to
justify
her
glory
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
do
glory
in
her
,
and
she
feel
,
and
have
cause
to
feel
,
that
it
deserve
to
be
hold
as
glorious
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
stand
there
for
hour
with
his
arm
round
her
,
have
fate
and
Mr.
Thorne
permit
it
.
<EOS>
each
moment
she
creep
nearer
to
his
bosom
and
feel
more
and
more
certain
that
there
be
her
home
.
<EOS>
what
now
to
her
be
the
archdeacon
's
arrogance
,
her
sister
's
coldness
,
or
her
dear
father
's
weakness
?
<EOS>
what
need
she
care
for
the
duplicity
of
such
friend
as
Charlotte
Stanhope
?
<EOS>
She
have
find
the
strong
shield
that
should
guard
her
from
all
wrong
,
the
trusty
pilot
that
should
henceforward
guide
her
through
the
shoal
and
rock
.
<EOS>
She
would
give
up
the
heavy
burden
of
her
independence
,
and
once
more
assume
the
position
of
a
woman
and
the
duty
of
a
trusting
and
love
wife
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
,
too
,
stand
there
fully
satisfied
with
his
place
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
look
intently
on
the
fire
,
as
though
they
could
read
there
their
future
fate
,
till
at
last
Eleanor
turn
her
face
towards
his
.
<EOS>
"
how
sad
you
be
,
"
she
say
,
smile
;
and
indeed
his
face
be
,
if
not
sad
,
at
least
serious
.
<EOS>
"
how
sad
you
be
,
love
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sad
,
"
say
he
,
look
down
at
her
;
"
no
,
certainly
not
sad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
sweet
,
loving
eye
be
turn
towards
him
,
and
she
smile
softly
as
he
answer
her
.
<EOS>
the
temptation
be
too
strong
even
for
the
demure
propriety
of
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
bend
over
her
,
he
press
his
lip
to
hers
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
after
this
Mr.
Thorne
appear
,
and
they
be
both
delighted
to
hear
that
the
tail
of
the
Beelzebub
colt
be
not
materially
injure
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
Mr.
Harding
's
intention
to
hurry
over
to
Ullathorne
as
soon
as
possible
after
his
return
to
Barchester
,
in
order
to
secure
the
support
of
his
daughter
in
his
meditate
revolt
against
the
archdeacon
as

deanery

but
he
be
spare
the
additional
journey
by
hear
that
Mrs.
Bold
have
return
unexpectedly
home
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
read
her
note
he
start
off
,
and
find
her
wait
for
him
in
her
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
how
much
each
of
them
have
to
tell
the
other
,
and
how
certain
each
be
that
the
story
which
he
or
she
have
to
tell
would
astonish
the
other
!
  
<EOS>
"
My

I
be
so
anxious

anticipate
by
the

<EOS>
"

in
her
joy
at

I

I

I

yet
you
can

<EOS>
then
I
certainly
will
rejoice
with
you

<EOS>
nelly

<EOS>
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
He
lead
her
to
the
sofa
and
,
seat
himself
beside
her
,
take
both
her
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
be
marry
,
nelly

<EOS>
be
not
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
,
if
you
will
approve
;
"
and
then
she
blush
as
she
remember
the
promise
which
she
have
so
lately
volunteer
to
him
and
which
she
have
so
utterly
forget
in
make
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
think
for
a
moment
who
the
man
could
be
whom
he
be
to
be
call
upon
to
welcome
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
a
week
since
he
would
have
have
no
doubt
whom
to
name
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
he
would
have
be
prepare
to
give
his
sanction
,
although
he
would
have
do
so
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
now
he
know
that
at
any
rate
it
would
not
be
Mr.
Slope
,
though
he
be
perfectly
at
a
loss
to
guess
who
could
possibly
have
fill
the
place
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
he
think
that
the
man
may
be
Bertie
Stanhope
,
and
his
very
soul
sink
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
nelly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Papa
,
promise
to
me
that
,
for
my
sake
,
you
will
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
nelly
,
come
;
tell
me
who
it
be

will
you
love
him

Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
,
I
must
love
anyone
that
you
love

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
turn
her
face
to
his
and
whisper
into
his
ear
the
name
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
no
man
that
she
could
have
name
could
have
more
surprised
or
more
delighted
him
.
<EOS>
have
he
look
round
the
world
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
to
his
taste
,
he
could
have
select
no
one
whom
he
would
have
prefer
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clergyman
;
he
hold
a
living
in
the
neighbourhood
;
he
be
of
a
set
to
which
all
Mr.
Harding
's
own
partiality
most
closely
adhere
;
he
be
the
great
friend
of
Dr.
Grantly
;
and
he
be
,
moreover
,
a
man
of
whom
Mr.
Harding
know
nothing
but
what
he
approve
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
his
surprise
be
so
great
as
to
prevent
the
immediate
expression
of
his
joy
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
think
of
Mr.
Arabin
in
connexion
with
his
daughter
;
he
have
never
imagine
that
they
have
any
feeling
in
common
.
<EOS>
He
have
fear
that
his
daughter
have
be
make
hostile
to
clergyman
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
stamp
by
her
intolerance
of
the
archdeacon
's
pretension
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
put
to
wish
,
he
may
have
wish
for
Mr.
Arabin
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
;
but
have
he
be
put
to
guess
,
the
name
would
never
have
occur
to
him

<EOS>
"
Mr.

<EOS>
he
exclaim
;

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Fickle

<EOS>
where
be
the

would
make
no

herself
without

She

cling

"
  
<EOS>
We
need
not
pursue
the
interview
any
further
.
<EOS>
by
degree
they
return
to
the
subject
of
the
new
promotion
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
try
to
prove
to
him
,
as
the
Grantlys
have
do
,
that
his
age
could
be
no
bar
to
his
be
a
very
excellent
dean
,
but
those
argument
have
now
even
less
weight
on
him
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
say
little
or
nothing
but
sit
,
meditative
.
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
kiss
his
daughter
and
say
"
yes
,
"
or
"
no
,
"
or
"
very
true
,
"
or
"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
can
not
quite
agree
with
you
there
,
"
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
be
get
to
enter
sharply
into
the
question
of
"
to
be
,
or
not
to
be
"
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
of
her
and
her
happiness
,
of
Mr.
Arabin
and
his
virtue
,
he
would
talk
as
much
as
Eleanor
desire
 
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
that
be
not
a
little
 
but
about
the
deanery
he
would
now
say
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
a
new
idea
into
his
head
 
why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
the
new
dean
?
   
<EOS>
the
Archdeacon
be
satisfied
with
the
State
of
Affairs
 
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
in
his
journey
into
Barchester
,
have
be
assure
by
Mr.
Harding
that
all
their
prognostication
about
Mr.
Slope
and
Eleanor
be
groundless
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
have
find
it
very
difficult
to
shake
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
faith
in
his
own
acuteness
.
<EOS>
the
matter
have
,
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
be
so
plainly
corroborate
by
such
patent
evidence
,
bear
out
by
such
endless
circumstance
,
that
he
at
first
refuse
to
take
as
true
the
positive
statement
which
Mr.
Harding
make
to
him
of
Eleanor
's
own
disavowal
of
the
impeachment
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
he
yield
in
a
qualified
way
.
<EOS>
He
bring
himself
to
admit
that
he
would
at
the
present
regard
his
past
conviction
as
a
mistake
,
but
in
do
this
he
so
guard
himself
that
if
,
at
any
future
time
,
Eleanor
should
come
forth
to
the
world
as
Mrs.
Slope
,
he
may
still
be
able
to
say
:
"
there
,
I
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
remember
what
you
say
and
what
I
say
;
and
remember
also
for
come
year
,
that
I
be
right
in
this
matter
 
as
in
all
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
carry
,
however
,
his
concession
so
far
as
to
bring
himself
to
undertake
to
call
at
Eleanor
's
house
,
and
he
do
call
accordingly
,
while
the
father
and
daughter
be
yet
in
the
middle
of
their
conference
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
have
so
much
to
hear
and
to
say
that
he
have
forget
to
advise
Eleanor
of
the
honour
that
await
her
,
and
she
hear
her
brother
-
in
-
law
's
voice
in
the
hall
while
she
be
quite
unprepared
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
archdeacon
,
"
she
say
,
spring
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
to
tell
you
that
he
would
come
and
see
you
;
but
to
tell
the
truth
I
have
forget
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
flee
away
,
regardless
of
all
her
father
's
entreaty
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
now
,
in
the
first
hour
of
her
joy
,
bring
herself
to
bear
all
the
archdeacon
's
retraction
,
apology
,
and
congratulation
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
so
much
to
say
,
and
would
be
so
tedious
in
say
it
;
consequently
,
the
archdeacon
,
when
he
be
show
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
find
no
one
there
but
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
Eleanor
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
anything
the
matter
?
"
ask
the
doctor
,
who
at
once
anticipate
that
the
whole
truth
about
Mr.
Slope
have
at
last
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
something
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
now
whether
you
will
be
much
surprised
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
see
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
manner
that
after
all
he
have
nothing
to
tell
him
about
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
certainly
not
 
nothing
will
ever
surprise
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
many
man
now
-
a
-
day
besides
the
archdeacon
adopt
or
affect
to
adopt
the
_
nil
admirari
_
doctrine
;
but
nevertheless
,
to
judge
from
their
appearance
,
they
be
just
as
subject
to
sudden
emotion
as
their
grandfather
and
grandmother
be
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
Mr.
Arabin
have
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Arabin
!
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
about
that
daughter
of
Stanhope
's
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
that
woman
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
enjoy
his
joke
in
his
sleeve
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
woman
!
<EOS>
be
he
go
to
do
anything
about
any
woman
?
<EOS>
why
can
not
you
speak
out
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
?
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
I
hate
so
much
as
these
sort
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
shall
be
no
mystery
with
you
,
Archdeacon
,
though
of
course
it
must
go
no
further
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
.
"
  
"
except
Susan
.
<EOS>
You
must
promise
me
you
will
tell
no
one
else
.
"
  
"
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
archdeacon
,
who
be
become
angry
in
his
suspense
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
have
any
secret
about
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
this
 
that
he
and
Eleanor
be
engage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
to
see
,
by
the
archdeacon
's
face
,
that
he
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
!
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
at
any
rate
,
have
just
now
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
,
"
repeat
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
not
say
I
think
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
take
me
by
surprise
,
but
that
do
not
make
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
mistake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
assure
him
that
there
be
no
mistake
;
that
he
would
find
,
on
return
home
,
that
Mr.
Arabin
have
be
at
plumstead
with
the
express
object
of
make
the
same
declaration
;
that
even
Miss
Thorne
know
all
about
it
;
and
that
,
in
fact
,
the
thing
be
as
clearly
settle
as
any
such
arrangement
between
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
could
well
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
walk
up
and
down
Eleanor
's
drawing
-
room
.
"
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
these
exclamation
certainly
betoken
faith
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
properly
gather
from
it
that
,
at
last
,
Dr.
Grantly
do
believe
the
fact
.
<EOS>
the
first
utterance
clearly
evince
a
certain
amount
of
distaste
at
the
information
he
have
receive
;
the
second
simply
indicate
surprise
;
in
the
tone
of
the
third
Mr.
Harding
fancy
that
he
could
catch
a
certain
gleam
of
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
truly
express
the
working
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
be
disgusted
to
find
how
utterly
astray
he
have
be
in
all
his
anticipation
.
<EOS>
have
he
only
be
lucky
enough
to
have
suggest
this
marriage
himself
when
he
first
bring
Mr.
Arabin
into
the
country
,
his
character
for
judgement
and
wisdom
would
have
receive
an
addition
which
would
have
class
him
at
any
rate
next
to
Solomon
.
<EOS>
and
why
have
he
not
do
so
?
<EOS>
may
he
not
have
foresee
that
Mr.
Arabin
would
want
a
wife
in
his
parsonage
?
<EOS>
He
have
foresee
that
Eleanor
would
want
a
husband
,
but
should
he
not
also
have
perceive
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
a
man
much
more
likely
to
attract
her
than
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
find
that
he
have
be
at
fault
and
,
of
course
,
could
not
immediately
get
over
his
discomfiture
.
  
<EOS>
then
his
surprise
be
intense
.
<EOS>
how
sly
this
pair
of
young
turtle
-
dove
have
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
how
egregiously
they
have
hoax
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
preach
to
Eleanor
against
her
fancy
attachment
to
Mr.
Slope
at
the
very
time
that
she
be
in
love
with
his
own
protégé
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
have
absolutely
take
that
same
Mr.
Arabin
into
his
confidence
with
reference
to
his
dread
of
Mr.
Slope
's
alliance
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
natural
that
the
archdeacon
should
feel
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
also
great
ground
for
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
match
by
itself
,
it
be
the
very
thing
to
help
the
doctor
out
of
his
difficulty
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
the
assurance
that
he
should
never
have
Mr.
Slope
for
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
in
itself
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Arabin
be
,
of
all
man
,
the
one
with
whom
it
would
best
suit
him
to
be
so
intimately
connect
.
<EOS>
but
the
crowning
comfort
be
the
blow
which
this
marriage
would
give
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
certainly
lose
his
wife
;
rumour
be
begin
to
whisper
that
he
may
possibly
lose
his
position
in
the
palace
;
and
if
Mr.
Harding
would
only
be
true
,
the
great
danger
of
all
would
be
surmount
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
it
may
be
expect
that
Mr.
Slope
would
own
himself
vanquish
,
and
take
himself
altogether
away
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
archdeacon
would
again
be
able
to
breathe
pure
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
"
and
the
tone
of
the
fifth
exclamation
make
Mr.
Harding
fully
aware
that
content
be
reign
in
the
archdeacon
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
slowly
,
gradually
,
and
craftily
Mr.
Harding
propound
his
own
new
scheme
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
the
new
dean
?
  
<EOS>
slowly
,
gradually
,
and
thoughtfully
Dr.
grantly
fall
into
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
view
.
<EOS>
much
as
he
like
Mr.
Arabin
,
sincere
as
be
his
admiration
for
that
gentleman
's
ecclesiastical
ability
,
he
would
not
have
sanction
a
measure
which
would
rob
his
father
-
in
-
law
of
his
fairly
earn
promotion
,
be
it
at
all
practicable
to
induce
his
father
-
in
-
law
to
accept
the
promotion
which
he
have
earn
.
<EOS>
but
the
archdeacon
have
,
on
a
former
occasion
,
receive
proof
of
the
obstinacy
with
which
Mr.
Harding
could
adhere
to
his
own
view
in
opposition
to
the
advice
of
all
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
know
tolerably
well
that
nothing
would
induce
the
meek
,
mild
man
before
him
to
take
the
high
place
offer
to
him
,
if
he
think
it
wrong
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
know
this
,
he
also
say
to
himself
more
than
once
:
"
why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
at
last
arrange
between
them
that
they
would
together
start
to
London
by
the
early
train
on
the
follow
morning
,
make
a
little
detour
to
Oxford
on
their
journey
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
's
counsel
,
they
imagine
,
may
perhaps
be
of
assistance
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
these
matter
settle
,
the
archdeacon
hurry
off
,
that
he
may
return
to
plumstead
and
prepare
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
extremely
fine
,
and
he
come
into
the
city
in
an
open
gig
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
drive
up
the
High
Street
he
encounter
Mr.
Slope
at
a
crossing
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
pull
up
rather
sharply
,
he
would
have
run
over
him
.
<EOS>
the
two
have
never
speak
to
each
other
since
they
have
meet
on
a
memorable
occasion
in
the
bishop
's
study
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
speak
now
,
but
they
look
each
other
full
in
the
face
,
and
Mr.
Slope
's
countenance
be
as
impudent
,
as
triumphant
,
as
defiant
as
ever
.
<EOS>
have
Dr.
grantly
not
know
to
the
contrary
,
he
would
have
imagine
that
his
enemy
have
win
the
deanship
,
the
wife
,
and
all
the
rich
honour
for
which
he
have
be
strive
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
have
lose
everything
that
he
have
in
the
world
,
and
have
just
receive
his
_
congé
_
from
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
in

<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
 
not

in
her
Sunday
best
,
not
very
clean
in
her
apparel
,
not
graceful
as
to
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
or
,
indeed
,
with
many
feminine
charm
as
to
her
whole
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
be
busy
at
domestic
work
in
her
new
house
,
and
have
just
venture
out
,
expect
to
see
no
one
on
the
arrival
of
the
family
chattel
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
down
upon
her
before
she
know
where
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
with
Dr.
Grantly
or
his
family
be
very
slight
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
know
every
clergyman
in
the
archdeaconry
 
<EOS>
it
may
almost
be
say
in
the
diocese
 
and
have
some
acquaintance
,
more
or
less
intimate
,
with
their
wife
and
family
.
<EOS>
with
Mr.
Quiverful
he
have
be
concern
on
various
matter
of
business
,
but
of
Mrs.
Q.
he
have
see
very
little
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
he
be
in
too
gracious
a
mood
to
pass
her
by
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
the
Quiverfuls
,
one
and
all
,
have
look
for
the
bitter
hostility
from
Dr.
grantly
;
they
know
his
anxiety
that
Mr.
Harding
should
return
to
his
old
home
at
the
hospital
,
and
they
do
not
know
that
a
new
home
have
be
offer
to
him
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
be
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
,
and
not
a
little
rejoiced
also
,
at
the
tone
in
which
she
be
address
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
stretch
his
left
hand
out
of
the
gig
as
he
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
employ
in
so
pleasant
and
useful
a
manner
;
very
glad
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
thank
him
,
and
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
look
into
his
face
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
sure
whether
the
congratulation
and
kindness
be
or
be
not
ironical
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
tell
Mr.
Quiverful
from
me
,
"
he
continue
,
"
that
I
be
rejoice
at
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfortable
place
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
and
a
comfortable
house
,
and
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
in
it
.
<EOS>
good

bye
 
good

<EOS>
"
and
he
drive
on
,
leave
the
lady
well
pleased
and
astonish
at
his
good
nature
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
thing
be
go
well
with
the
archdeacon
,
and
he
could
afford
to
be
charitable
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
He
look
forth
from
his
gig
smilingly
on
all
the
world
,
and
forgave
everyone
in
Barchester
their
sin
,
except
only
Mrs.
Proudie
and
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
have
he
see
the
bishop
,
he
would
have
feel
inclined
to
pat
even
him
kindly
on
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
He
determine
to
go
home
by
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
this
would
take
him
some
three
mile
out
of
his
way
,
but
he
feel
that
he
could
not
leave
Plumstead
comfortably
without
say
one
word
of
good
-
fellowship
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
the
parsonage
,
the
vicar
be
still
out
,
but
from
what
he
have
hear
,
he
do
not
doubt
but
that
he
would
meet
him
on
the
road
between
their
two
house
.
<EOS>
He
be
right
in
this
,
for
about
half
-
way
home
,
at
a
narrow
turn
,
he
come
upon
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
be
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,

"
say
the
archdeacon
loudly
,
joyously
,
and
with
supreme
good
humour
;
"
well
,
well
,
well
,
well

so
,
after
all
,
we
have
no
further
cause
to
fear
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
from
Mrs.
grantly
that
they
have
offer
the
deanery
to
Mr.
Harding

"
say
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
have
lose
more
than
the
deanery
I
find
,
"
and
then
the
archdeacon
laugh
jocosely
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
Arabin
,
you
have
keep
your
secret
well
enough

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have

Archdeacon

"
say
the
other
with
a
quiet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
none
at
all
 
not
for
a
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
yesterday
that
I
know
my
own
good
fortune
,
and
to
-
day
I
go
over
to
plumstead
to
ask
your
approval
.
<EOS>
from
what
Mrs.
Grantly
have
say
to
me
,
I
be
lead
to
hope
that
I
shall
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
cordially
,
hold
his
friend
fast
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
as
I
would
have
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
excellent
young
woman
;
she
will
not
come
to
you
empty
-
handed
;
and
I
think
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife
.
<EOS>
if
she
do
her
duty
by
you
as
her
sister
do
by
me
,
you
will
be
a
happy
man
;
that
be
all
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
as
he
finish
speak
a
tear
may
have
be
observe
in
each
of
the
doctor
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
warmly
return
the
archdeacon
's
grasp
,
but
he
say
little
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
too
full
for
speak
,
and
he
could
not
express
the
gratitude
which
he
feel
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
understand
him
as
well
as
though
he
have
speak
for
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
mind
,
Arabin
,
"
say
he
,
"
no
one
but
myself
shall
tie
the
knot
.
<EOS>
We
will
get
Eleanor
out
to
Plumstead
,
and
it
shall
come
off
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
Susan
stir
herself
,
and
we
will
do
it
in
style
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
off
to
London
to
-
morrow
on
special
business
.
<EOS>
harding
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
be
back
before
your
bride
have
get
her
wedding
-
dress
ready
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
journey
home
the
archdeacon
occupy
his
mind
with
preparation
for
the
marriage
festivity
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
great
resolve
that
he
would
atone
to
Eleanor
for
all
the
injury
he
have
do
her
by
the
munificence
of
his
future
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
would
show
her
what
be
the
difference
in
his
eye
between
a
Slope
and
an
Arabin
.
<EOS>
on
one
other
thing
also
he
decide
with
a
firm
mind
:
if
the
affair
of
the
dean
should
not
be
settle
in
Mr.
Arabin
's
favour
,
nothing
should
prevent
him
put
a
new
front
and
bow
-
window
to
the
dining
-
room
at
St.
Ewold
's
parsonage
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
we
be
sell
after
all
,
Sue
,
"
say
he
to
his
wife
,
accost
her
with
a
kiss
as
soon
as
he
enter
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
call
his
wife
Sue
above
twice
or
thrice
in
a
year
,
and
these
occasion
be
great
high
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
have
have
more
sense
than
we
give
her
credit
for
,
"
say
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
great
content
in
Plumstead
Rectory
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
promise
her
husband
that
she
would
now
open
her
heart
and
take
Mr.
Arabin
into
it
.
<EOS>
hitherto
she
have
decline
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Bids
Farewell
to
the
Palace
and
Its
inhabitant
 
<EOS>
We
must
now
take
leave
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
of
the
bishop
also
,
and
of
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
these
leave
-
taking
in
novel
be
as
disagreeable
as
they
be
in
real
life
;
not
so
sad
,
indeed
,
for
they
want
the
reality
of
sadness
;
but
quite
as
perplexing
,
and
generally
less
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
what
novelist
,
what
fielding
,
what
Scott
,
what
George
Sand
,
or
Sue
,
or
Dumas
,
can
impart
an
interest
to
the
last
chapter
of
his
fictitious
history
?
<EOS>
promise
of
two
child
and
superhuman
happiness
be
of
no
avail
,
nor
assurance

extreme
respectability

<EOS>
the
sorrow

they
be
your
delight
,
oh
public

<EOS>
their
sorrow

or
their
sin
,
or
their
absurdity
;
not
their
virtue

good
sense

and
consequent
reward
.
<EOS>
when
we
begin
to
tint
our
final
page
with
_
couleur

_
,
as
in
accordance
with
fix
rule
we
must

we
altogether
extinguish
our

<EOS>
when
we
become
dull

we
offend

and
we
must
become
dull

we
should
offend
your

<EOS>
a
late
writer
,
wish
to
sustain
his
interest
to
the
last
page
,
hang
his
hero
at
the
end
of
the
third
volume
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
that
no
one
would
read
his
novel
.
<EOS>
and
who
can
apportion
out
and
dovetail
his
incident
,
dialogue
,
character
,
and
descriptive
morsel
so
as
to
fit
them
all
exactly
into
930
page
,
without
either
compress
them
unnaturally
,
or
extend
them
artificially
at
the
end
of
his
labour

<EOS>
do
I
not
myself
know
that
I
be
at
this
moment
in
want
of
a
dozen
page
,
and
that
I
be
sick
with
cudgel
my
brain
to
find
them
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
everything
be
do

the
kindest

hearted
critic
of
them
all
invariably
twit
us
with
the
incompetency
and
lameness
of
our
conclusion
.
<EOS>
We
have
either
become
idle
and
neglect
it
,
or
tedious
and
overlaboure
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
insipid
or
unnatural
,
overstrain
or
imbecile

<EOS>
It
mean
nothing
,
or
attempt
too
much

<EOS>
the
last
scene

all

as
all
last
scene
we
fear
must
be

be
second
childishness

mere
oblivion
,
Sans
tooth

san

<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
if
some
critic
who
thoroughly
know
his
work
,
and
have
labour
on
it
till
experience
have
make
him
perfect
,
will
write
the
last
fifty
page
of
a
novel
in
the
way
they
should
be
write

<EOS>
I
,
for

,
will
in
future
do
my
good
to
copy
the
example

<EOS>
guide
by
my
own
light

I
confess
that
I
despair
of
success

<EOS>
for
the
last
week
or
ten
day
Mr.
Slope
have
see
nothing
of
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
very
little
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
still
live
in
the
palace
,
and
still
go
through
his
usual
routine
work
;
but
the
confidential
doing
of
the
diocese
have
pass
into
other
hand
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
this
clearly
and
mark
it
well
,
but
it
have
not
much
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
indulge
in
other
hope
till
the
bishop
's
affair
have
become
dull
to
him
,
and
he
be
moreover
aware
that
,
as
regard
the
diocese
,
Mrs.
Proudie
have
checkmate
him
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
explain

in
the

how

You
hear

Mrs.

I
decidedly
shall
do

I
presume
you

discard

she
have
object

<EOS>
"
You
may
publish
what
you
please
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
not
be
insane
enough
to
publish
any
of
your
doing
in
Barchester

<EOS>
do
you
think
I
have
not
hear
of
your
kneeling
at
that
creature

foot
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
she
have
any
foot

of
your
constant
slobbering
over

I
advise
you
to
beware
,
Mr.

of
what
you
do

say

<EOS>
clergyman
have
be
unfrocked
for
less
than
what
you
have
be
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
if
this
go
on
I
shall
be
oblige
to
indict
this
woman
 
Mrs.
Proudie
<EOS>
I
mean
 
for
defamation
of
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mr.
Slope
,
you
have
well
now
retire
,
"
say
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
enclose
to
you
a
cheque
for
any
balance
that
may
be
due
to
you
;
under
the
present
circumstance
,
it
will
of
course
be
well
for
all
party
that
you
should
leave
the
palace
at
the
early
possible
moment
.
<EOS>
I
will
allow
you
for
your
journey
back
to
London
and
for
your
maintenance
in
Barchester
for
a
week
from
this
date
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
,
however
,
you
wish
to
remain
in
this
neighbourhood
;
"
say
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
and
will
solemnly
pledge
yourself
never
again
to
see
that
woman
,
and
will
promise
also
to
be
more
circumspect
in
your
conduct
,
the
bishop
will
mention
your
name
to
Mr.
Quiverful
,
who
now
want
a
curate
at
Puddingdale
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
,
I
imagine
,
quite
sufficient
for
your
requirement
,
and
there
will
moreover
be
a
stipend
of
fifty
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
May
God
forgive
you
,
madam
,
for
the
manner
in
which
you
have
treat
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Slope
,
look
at
her
with
a
very
heavenly
look
;
"
and
remember
this
,
madam
,
that
you
yourself
may
still
have
a
fall
;
"
and
he
look
at
her
with
a
very
worldly
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
bishop
,
I
pity
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
Mr.
Slope
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
thus
end
the
intimacy
of
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
with
his
first
confidential
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
be
right
in
this
;
namely
,
that
Mr.
Slope
be
not
insane
enough
to
publish
to
the
world
any
of
his
doing
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
trouble
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
with
any
write
statement
of
the
iniquity
of
Mrs.
Proudie
,
or
the
imbecility
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
it
would
be
wise
in
him
to
drop
for
the
future
all
allusion
to
his
doing
in
the
cathedral
city
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
interview
just
record
he
leave
Barchester
,
shake
the
dust
off
his
foot
as
he
enter
the
railway
carriage
;
and
he
give
no
longing
,
linger
look
after
the
cathedral
tower
as
the
train
hurry
him
quickly
out
of
their
sight
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
that
the
family
of
the
Slopes
never
starve
:
they
always
fall
on
their
foot
,
like
cat
;
and
let
them
fall
where
they
will
,
they
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Our
Mr.
Slope
do
so
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
to
town
he
find
that
the
sugar
-
refiner
have
die
and
that
his
widow
be
inconsolable
 
in
other
word
,
in
want
of
consolation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
console
her
,
and
soon
find
himself
settle
with
much
comfort
in
the
house
in
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
He
possess
himself
,
also
,
before
long
,
of
a
church
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Red
Road
,
and
become
known
to
fame
as
one
of
the
most
eloquent
preacher
and
pious
clergyman
in
that
part
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
there
let
us
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
bishop
and
his
wife
very
little
further
need
be
say
.
<EOS>
from
that
time
forth
nothing
material
occur
to
interrupt
the
even
course
of
their
domestic
harmony
.
<EOS>
very
speedily
,
a
further
vacancy
on
the
bench
of
bishop
give
to
Dr.
Proudie
the
seat
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
which
he
at
first
so
anxiously
long
for
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
he
have
become
a
wise
man
.
<EOS>
He
do
certainly
take
his
seat
,
and
occasionally
register
a
vote
in
favour
of
Government
view
on
ecclesiastical
matter
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
thoroughly
learn
that
his
proper
sphere
of
action
lie
in
close
contiguity
with
Mrs.
Proudie
's
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
He
never
again
aspire
to
disobey
,
or
seem
even
to
wish
for
autocratic
diocesan
authority
.
<EOS>
if
ever
he
think
of
freedom
,
he
do
so
as
man
think
of
the
millennium
,
as
of
a
good
time
which
may
be
come
,
but
which
nobody
expect
to
come
in
their
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
may
be
say
still
to
bloom
,
and
be
,
at
any
rate
,
strong
,
and
the
bishop
have
no
reason
to
apprehend
that
he
would
be
speedily
visit
with
the
sorrow
of
a
widower
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
grace
that
throne
that
the
Government
have
be
averse
to
translate
him
,
even
to
high
dignity
.
<EOS>
there
may
he
remain
,
under
safe
pupilage
,
till
the
newfangle
manner
of
the
age
have
discover
him
to
be
superannuate
and
bestow
on
him
a
pension
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs.
Proudie
,
our
prayer
for
her
be
that
she
may
live
forever

<EOS>
the
new
Dean
take
Possession
of
the
Deanery
,
and
the
New
Warden
of
the
hospital
 
Mr.
Harding
and
the
archdeacon
together
make
their
way
to
Oxford
,
and
there
,
by
dint
of
cunne
argument
,
they
induce
the
Master
of
Lazarus
also
to
ask
himself
this
momentous
question
:
"
why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
He
,
of
course
,
for
awhile
try
his
hand
at
persuade
Mr.
Harding
that
he
be
foolish
,
overscrupulous
,
self
-
willed
,
and
weak
-
minded
;
but
he
try
in
vain
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Harding
would
not
give
way
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
it
be
not
likely
that
he
would
give
way
to
Dr.
Gwynne
,
more
especially
now
that
so
admirable
a
scheme
as
that
of
induct
Mr.
Arabin
into
the
deanery
have
be
set
on
foot
.
<EOS>
when
the
master
find
that
his
eloquence
be
vain
,
and
hear
also
that
Mr.
Arabin
be
about
to
become
Mr.
Harding
's
son
-
in
-
law
,
he
confess
that
he
also
would
,
under
such
circumstance
,
be
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
and
protégé
,
the
fellow
of
his
college
,
place
in
the
comfortable
position
that
be
go
a
-
begging
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
the
mean
you
know
,
Master
,
of
keep
Mr.
Slope
out
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
with
grave
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
no
more
chance
of
it
,
"
say
the
master
,
"
than
our
college
chaplain
.
<EOS>
I
know
more
about
it
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
have
be
right
in
her
surmise
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Master
of
Lazarus
who
have
be
instrumental
in
represent
in
high
place
the
claim
which
Mr.
Harding
have
upon
the
Government
,
and
he
now
consent
to
use
his
good
endeavour
towards
get
the
offer
transfer
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
the
three
of
them
go
on
to
London
together
,
and
there
they
remain
a
week
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
Mrs.
Grantly
,
and
most
probably
also
of
Mrs.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
the
minister
be
out
of
town
in
one
direction
,
and
his
private
secretary
in
another
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
who
remain
could
do
nothing
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
and
all
be
difficulty
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
the
two
doctor
seem
to
have
plenty
to
do
;
they
bustle
here
<EOS>
and
they
bustle
there
,
and
complain
at
their
club
in
the
evening
that
they
have
be
drive
off
their
leg
;
but
Mr.
Harding
have
no
occupation
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
suggest
that
he
may
perhaps
return
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
request
,
however
,
be
peremptorily
refuse
,
and
he
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
while
away
his
time
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
an
answer
from
the
great
man
come
.
<EOS>
the
Master
of
Lazarus
have
make
his
proposition
through
the
Bishop
of
Belgravia
.
<EOS>
now
this
bishop
,
though
but
newly
gifted
with
his
diocesan
honour
,
be
a
man
of
much
weight
in
the
clerico
-
political
world
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
if
not
as
pious
,
at
any
rate
as
wise
as
St.
Paul
,
and
have
be
with
so
much
effect
all
thing
to
all
man
that
,
though
he
be
great
among
the
don
of
Oxford
,
he
have
be
select
for
the
most
favourite
seat
on
the
bench
by
a
Whig
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
to
him
Dr.
Gwynne
have
make
know
his
wish
and
his
argument
,
and
the
bishop
have
make
them
known
to
the
Marquis
of
Kensington
-
Gore
.
<EOS>
the
marquis
,
who
be
Lord
High
Steward
of
the
Pantry
Board
,
and
who
by
most
man
be
suppose
to
hold
the
high
office
out
of
the
cabinet
,
traffic
much
in
affair
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
suggest
the
arrangement
to
the
minister
over
a
cup
of
coffee
,
stand
on
a
drawing
-
room
rug
in
Windsor
Castle
,
but
he
also
favourably
mention
Mr.
Arabin
's
name
in
the
ear
of
a
distinguished
person
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
matter
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
the
answer
of
the
great
man
come
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
be
make
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
the
three
clergyman
who
have
come
up
to
town
on
this
important
mission
dine
together
with
great
glee
on
the
day
on
which
the
news
reach
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
silent
,
decent
,
clerical
manner
they
toast
Mr.
Arabin
with
full
bumper
of
claret
.
<EOS>
the
satisfaction
of
all
of
them
be
supreme
.
<EOS>
the
Master
of
Lazarus
have
be
successful
in
his
attempt
,
and
success
be
dear
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
trample
upon
Mr.
Slope
,
and
have
lift
to
high
honour
the
young
clergyman
whom
he
have
induce
to
quit
the
retirement
and
comfort
of
the
university
.
<EOS>
so
at
least
the
archdeacon
thought
;
though
,
to
speak
sooth
,
not
he
,
but
circumstance
,
have
trample
on
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
but
the
satisfaction
of
Mr.
Harding
be
,
of
all
,
perhaps
,
the
most
complete
.
<EOS>
He
lay
aside
his
usual
melancholy
manner
and
bring
forth
little
quiet
joke
from
the
inmost
mirth
of
his
heart
;
he
poke
his
fun
at
the
archdeacon
about
Mr.
Slope
's
marriage
and
quiz
him
for
his
improper
love
for
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
they
all
return
to
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
arrange
that
Mr.
Arabin
should
know
nothing
of
what
have
be
do
till
he
receive
the
minister
's
letter
from
the
hand
of
his
embryo
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
in
order
that
no
time
may
be
lose
,
a
message
have
be
send
to
him
by
the
precede
night
's
post
,
beg
him
to
be
at
the
deanery
at
the
hour
that
the
train
from
London
arrive
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
this
which
surprise
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
It
have
somehow
get
about
through
all
Barchester
that
Mr.
Harding
be
the
new
dean
,
and
all
Barchester
be
prepared
to
welcome
him
with
pealing
bell
and
full
heart
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
have
certainly
have
a
party
;
there
have
certainly
be
those
in
Barchester
who
be
prepared
to
congratulate
him
on
his
promotion
with
assumed
sincerity
,
but
even
his
own
party
be
not
break
-
hearted
by
his
failure
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
the
city
,
even
the
high
-
souled
,
ecstatic
young
lady
of
thirty
-
five
,
have
begin
to
comprehend
that
their
welfare
,
and
the
welfare
of
the
place
,
be
connect
in
some
mysterious
manner
with
daily
chant
and
bi
-
weekly
anthem
.
<EOS>
the
expenditure
of
the
palace
have
not
add
much
to
the
popularity
of
the
bishop
's
side
of
the
question
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,
there
be
a
strong
reaction
.
<EOS>
when
it
become
known
to
all
the
world
that
Mr.
Harding
be
to
be
the
new
dean
,
all
the
world
rejoice
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
we
have
say
,
be
not
surprised
at
the
summon
which
call
him
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
as
yet
see
Mr.
Harding
since
Eleanor
have
accept
him
,
nor
have
he
see
him
since
he
have
learn
his
future
father
-
in
-
law
's
preferment
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
natural
,
more
necessary
,
than
that
they
should
meet
each
other
at
the
early
possible
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
be
wait
in
the
deanery
parlour
when
Mr.
Harding
and
Dr.
Grantly
be
drive
up
from
the
station
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
excitement
in
the
bosom
of
them
all
,
as
they
meet
and
shake
hand
;
by
far
too
much
to
enable
either
of
them
to
begin
his
story
and
tell
it
in
a
proper
equable
style
of
narrative
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
be
some
minute
quite
dumbfounded
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
could
only
talk
in
short
,
spasmodic
sentence
about
his
love
and
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
slip
in
,
as
best
he
could
,
some
sort
of
congratulation
about
the
deanship
,
and
then
go
on
with
his
hope
and
fear
 
hope
that
he
may
be
receive
as
a
son
,
and
fear
that
he
hardly
deserve
such
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
back
to
the
dean
;
it
be
the
most
thoroughly
satisfactory
appointment
,
he
say
,
of
which
he
have
ever
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
!
<EOS>
but
!
<EOS>
but
 
"
say
Mr.
Harding
,
and
then
,
fail
to
get
any
further
,
he
look
imploringly
at
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
Arabin
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
that
,
after
all
you
be
not
destine
to
be
son
-
in
-
law
to
a
dean
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
either
:
more
be
the
pity
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
look
at
him
for
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
be
not
Mr.
Harding
to
be
the
new
dean
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appear
not
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
's
face
fall
a
little
,
and
he
look
from
one
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
plainly
to
be
see
from
them
both
that
there
be
no
cause
of
unhappiness
in
the
matter
,
at
least
not
of
unhappiness
to
them
;
but
there
be
as
yet
no
elucidation
of
the
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
think
how
old
I
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fiddlestick
!
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
but
it
will
not
make
a
young
man
of
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
to
be
dean
?
"
ask
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
be
the
question
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
Mr.
Precentor
,
since
you
obstinately
refuse
to
be
anything
else
,
let
us
know
who
be
to
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
the
nomination
in
his
pocket
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
eye
brim
full
of
tear
,
Mr.
Harding
pull
out
the
letter
and
hand
it
to
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
make
a
little
speech
but
fail
altogether
.
<EOS>
have
give
up
the
document
,
he
turn
round
to
the
wall
,
feign
to
blow
his
nose
,
and
then
sit
himself
down
on
the
old
dean
's
dingy
horsehair
sofa
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
find
it
necessary
to
bring
our
account
of
the
interview
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
nor
can
we
pretend
to
describe
the
rapture
with
which
Mr.
Harding
be
receive
by
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
weep
with
grief
and
weep
with
joy
 
with
grief
that
her
father
should
,
in
his
old
age
,
still
be
without
that
rank
and
worldly
position
which
,
accord
to
her
idea
,
he
have
so
well
earn
;
and
with
joy
in
that
he
,
her
darle
father
,
should
have
bestow
on
that
other
dear
one
the
good
thing
of
which
he
himself
would
not
open
his
hand
to
take
possession
.
<EOS>
and
here
Mr.
Harding
again
show
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
in
the
_
mêlée
_
of
this
exposal
of
their
love
and
reciprocal
affection
,
he
find
himself
unable
to
resist
the
entreaty
of
all
party
that
the
lodging
in
the
High
Street
should
be
give
up
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
would
not
live
in
the
deanery
,
she
say
,
unless
her
father
live
there
also
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
would
not
be
dean
,
unless
Mr.
Harding
would
be
co
-
dean
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
declare
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
should
not
have
his
own
way
in
everything
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
carry
him
off
to
Plumstead
,
that
he
may
remain
there
till
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Arabin
be
in
a
state
to
receive
him
in
their
own
mansion
.
  
<EOS>
press
by
such
argument
as
these
,
what
could
a
weak
old
man
do
but
yield
?
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
yet
another
task
which
it
behove
Mr.
Harding
to
do
before
he
could
allow
himself
to
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
little
have
be
say
in
these
page
of
the
state
of
those
remain
old
man
who
have
live
under
his
sway
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
but
not
on
this
account
must
it
be
presume
that
he
have
forget
them
,
or
that
in
their
state
of
anarchy
and
in
their
want
of
due
government
he
have
omit
to
visit
them
.
<EOS>
He
visit
them
constantly
,
and
have
latterly
give
them
to
understand
that
they
would
soon
be
require
to
subscribe
their
adherence
to
a
new
master
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
but
five
of
them
,
one
of
them
have
be
but
quite
lately
carry
to
his
rest
 
but
five
of
the
full
number
,
which
have
hitherto
be
twelve
,
and
which
be
now
to
be
raise
to
twenty
-
four
,
include
woman
.
<EOS>
of
these
,
old
Bunce
,
who
for
many
year
have
be
the
favourite
of
the
late
warden
,
be
one
;
and
Abel
Handy
,
who
have
be
the
humble
mean
of
drive
that
warden
from
his
home
,
be
another
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
now
resolve
that
he
himself
would
introduce
the
new
warden
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
many
circumstance
may
conspire
to
make
the
man
receive
Mr.
Quiverful
with
aversion
and
disrespect
;
he
feel
also
that
Mr.
Quiverful
may
himself
feel
some
qualm
of
conscience
if
he
enter
the
hospital
with
an
idea
that
he
do
so
in
hostility
to
his
predecessor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
therefore
determine
to
walk
in
,
arm
in
arm
with
Mr.
Quiverful
,
and
to
ask
from
these
man
their
respectful
obedience
to
their
new
master
.
  
<EOS>
on
return
to
Barchester
,
he
find
that
Mr.
Quiverful
have
not
yet
sleep
in
the
hospital
house
,
or
enter
on
his
new
duty
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
make
known
to
that
gentleman
his
wish
,
and
his
proposition
be
not
reject
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
bright
,
clear
morning
,
though
in
November
,
that
Mr.
Harding
and
Mr.
Quiverful
,
arm
in
arm
,
walk
through
the
hospital
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
trait
in
our
old
friend
's
character
that
he
do
nothing
with
parade
.
<EOS>
He
omit
,
even
in
the
more
important
doing
of
his
life
,
that
sort
of
parade
by
which
most
of
us
deem
it
necessary
to
grace
our
important
doing
.
<EOS>
We
have
house
-
warming
,
christening
,
and
gala
day
;
we
keep
,
if
not
our
own
birthday
,
those
of
our
child
;
we
be
apt
to
fuss
ourselves
if
call
upon
to
change
our
residence
and
have
,
almost
all
of
us
,
our
little
state
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
have
no
state
occasion
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
his
old
house
,
he
go
forth
from
it
with
the
same
quiet
composure
as
though
he
be
merely
take
his
daily
walk
;
now
that
he
re
-
enter
it
with
another
warden
under
his
wing
,
he
do
so
with
the
same
quiet
step
and
calm
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
less
upright
than
he
have
be
five
year
<EOS>
,
nay
,
it
be
now
nearly
six
year
ago
;
he
walk
perhaps
a
little
slow
;
his
footfall
be
perhaps
a
thought
less
firm
;
otherwise
one
may
have
say
that
he
be
merely
return
with
a
friend
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
this
friendliness
be
everything
to
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
to
him
,
even
in
his
poverty
,
the
thought
that
he
be
supplant
a
brother
clergyman
so
kind
and
courteous
as
Mr.
Harding
have
be
very
bitter
.
<EOS>
under
his
circumstance
it
have
be
impossible
for
him
to
refuse
the
proffer
boon
;
he
could
not
reject
the
bread
that
be
offer
to
his
child
,
or
refuse
to
ease
the
heavy
burden
that
have
so
long
oppress
that
poor
wife
of
his
;
nevertheless
,
it
have
be
very
grievous
to
him
to
think
that
in
go
to
the
hospital
he
may
encounter
the
ill
-
will
of
his
brother
in
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
all
this
Mr.
Harding
have
fully
comprehend
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
such
feeling
as
these
,
for
the
nice
comprehension
of
such
motive
,
that
his
heart
and
intellect
be
peculiarly
fit
.
<EOS>
in
most
matter
of
worldly
import
the
archdeacon
set
down
his
father
-
in
-
law
as
little
well
than
a
fool
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
he
be
right
.
<EOS>
but
in
some
other
matter
,
equally
important
if
they
be
rightly
judge
,
Mr.
Harding
,
have
he
be
so
minded
,
may
with
as
much
propriety
have
set
down
his
son
-
in
-
law
for
a
fool
.
<EOS>
few
man
,
however
,
be
constitute
as
be
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
have
that
nice
appreciation
of
the
feeling
of
other
which
belong
of
right
exclusively
to
woman
.
  
<EOS>
arm
in
arm
they
walk
into
the
inner
quadrangle
of
the
building
,
and
there
the
five
old
man
meet
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
shake
hand
with
them
all
,
and
then
Mr.
Quiverful
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
with
Bunce
Mr.
Harding
shake
hand
twice
,
and
Mr.
Quiverful
be
about
to
repeat
the
same
ceremony
,
but
the
old
man
give
him
no
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
know
that
at
last
you
have
a
new
warden
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
in
a
very
cheery
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
very
old
for
any
change
,
"
say
one
of
them
,
"
but
we
do
suppose
it
be
all
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
 
certainly
it
be
for
the
good
,
"
say
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
again
have
a
clergyman
of
your
own
church
under
the
same
roof
with
you
,
and
a
very
excellent
clergyman
you
will
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
so
good
a
man
be
come
to
take
care
of
you
,
and
that
it
be
no
stranger
,
but
a
friend
of
my
own
who
will
allow
me
from
time
to
time
to
come
in
and
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
very
thankful
to
your
reverence
,
"
say
another
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
,
my
good
friend
,
"
say
Mr.
Quiverful
,
"
how
extremely
grateful
I
be
to
Mr.
Harding
for
his
kindness
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
must
say
his
uncalled

unexpected
kindness

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
very
kind
,
"
say
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
can
do
to
fill
the
void
which
he
leave
here
<EOS>
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
for
your
sake
and
my
own
I
will
do
so
,
and
especially
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
but
to
you
who
have
know
him
,
I
can
never
be
the
same
well
-
love
friend
and
father
that
he
have
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
no
,
"
say
old
Bunce
,
who
hitherto
have
hold
his
peace
;
"
no
one
can
be
that
.
<EOS>
not
if
the
new
bishop
send
a
hangel
to
us
out
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
doubt
you
will
do
your
good
,
sir
,
but
you
will
not
be
like
the
old
master
 
not
to
us
old
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Fie
,
Bunce
,
fie
;
how
dare
you
talk
in
that
way
?
"
say
Mr.
Harding
;
but
as
he
scold
the
old
man
he
still
hold
him
by
his
arm
and
press
it
with
warm
affection
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
get
up
any
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
how
could
five
old
man
totter
away
to
their
final
resting
place
be
enthusiastic
on
the
reception
of
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
what
could
Mr.
Quiverful
be
to
them
,
or
they
to
Mr.
Quiverful
?
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Harding
indeed
come
back
to
them
,
some
last
flicker
of
joyous
light
may
have
shine
forth
on
their
aged
cheek
;
but
it
be
in
vain
to
bid
them
rejoice
because
Mr.
Quiverful
be
about
to
move
his
fourteen
child
from
Puddingdale
into
the
hospital
house
.
<EOS>
in
reality
they
do
no
doubt
receive
advantage
,
spiritual
as
well
as
corporal
,
but
this
they
could
neither
anticipate
nor
acknowledge
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
dull
affair
enough
,
this
introduction
of
Mr.
Quiverful
,
but
still
it
have
its
effect
.
<EOS>
the
good
which
Mr.
Harding
intend
do
not
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
all
the
Barchester
world
,
include
the
five
old
bedesman
,
treat
Mr.
Quiverful
with
the
more
respect
because
Mr.
Harding
have
thus
walk
in
,
arm
in
arm
with
him
,
on
his
first
entrance
to
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
in
their
new
abode
we
will
leave
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
and
their
fourteen
child
.
<EOS>
May
they
enjoy
the
good
thing
which
Providence
have
at
length
give
to
them
!
    
<EOS>
Conclusion
  
<EOS>
the
end
of
a
novel
,
like
the
end
of
a
child
's
dinner
party
,
must
be
make
up
of
sweetmeat
and
sugar
-
plum
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
nothing
else
to
be
tell
but
the
gala
doing
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
marriage
,
nothing
more
to
be
describe
than
the
wedding
-
dress
,
no
further
dialogue
to
be
record
than
that
which
take
place
between
the
archdeacon
,
who
marry
them
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
and
Eleanor
,
who
be
married
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wed
wife
,
"
and
"
wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
thy
wedded
husband
,
to
live
together
accord
to
God
's
ordinance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
and
Eleanor
each
answer
,
"
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
that
they
will
keep
their
promise
,
the
more
especially
as
the
Signora
Neroni
have
leave
Barchester
before
the
ceremony
be
perform
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
have
be
somewhat
more
than
two
year
a
widow
before
she
be
married
to
her
second
husband
,
and
little
Johnny
be
then
able
with
due
assistance
to
walk
on
his
own
leg
into
the
drawing
-
room
to
receive
the
salutation
of
the
assemble
guest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
give
away
the
bride
,
the
archdeacon
perform
the
service
,
and
the
two
Miss
Grantlys
,
who
be

their
labour
by
other
young

of
the
neighbourhood
,
perform
the
duty
of
bridesmaid
with
equal
diligence
and
grace
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
superintend
the
breakfast
and
bouquet
,
and
Mary
Bold
distribute
the
card
and
cake
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
's
three
son
have
also
come
home
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
elder
be
great
with
learning
,
be
regard
by
all
who
know
him
as
a
certain
future
double
first

<EOS>
the
second
,
however
,
bear
the
palm
on
this
occasion
,
be
resplendent
in
a
new
uniform
.
<EOS>
the
third
be
just
enter
the
university
,
and
be
probably
the
proud
of
the
three
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
whole
occasion
be
the
excessive
liberality
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
literally
make
present
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Arabin
have
already
move
out
of
the
parsonage
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
that
scheme
of
elongate
the
dining
-
room
be
of
course
abandon
;
but
he
would
have
refurnish
the
whole
deanery
have
he
be
allow
.
<EOS>
He
send
down
a
magnificent
piano
by
Erard
,
give
Mr.
Arabin
a
cob
which
any
dean
in
the
land
may
have
be
proud
to
bestride
,
and
make
a
special
present
to
Eleanor
of
a
new
pony
chair
that
have
gain
a
prize
in
the
exhibition
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
even
stay
his
hand
here
;
he
buy
a
set
of
cameo
for
his
wife
and
a
sapphire
bracelet
for
Miss
Bold
;
shower
pearl
and
work
-
box
on
his
daughter
;
and
to
each
of
his
son
he
present
a
check
for
£
20
.
<EOS>
on
Mr.
Harding
he
bestow
a
magnificent
violoncello
with
all
the
new
-
fashioned
arrangement
and
expensive
addition
,
which
on
account
of
these
novelty
that
gentleman
could
never
use
with
satisfaction
to
his
audience
or
pleasure
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
know
the
archdeacon
well
perfectly
understand
the
cause
of
his
extravagance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
he
sing
his
song
of
triumph
over
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
pæan
,
his
hymn
of
thanksgiving
,
his
loud
oration
.
<EOS>
He
have
gird
himself
with
his
sword
and
go
forth
to
the
war
;
now
he
be
return
from
the
field
laden
with
the
spoil
of
the
foe
.
<EOS>
the
cob
and
the
cameo
,
the
violoncello
and
the
pianoforte
,
be
all
as
it
be
trophy
reave
from
the
tent
of
his
now
-
conquer
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
the
Arabins
after
their
marriage
go
abroad
for
a
couple
of
month
,
accord
to
the
custom
in
such
matter
now
duly
establish
,
and
then
commence
their
deanery
life
under
good
auspex
.
<EOS>
and
nothing
can
be
more
pleasant
than
the
present
arrangement
of
ecclesiastical
affair
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
the
titular
bishop
never
interfere
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
not
often
.
<EOS>
Her
sphere
be
more
extended
,
more
noble
,
and
more
suited
to
her
ambition
than
that
of
a
cathedral
city
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
she
can
do
what
she
please
with
the
diocese
,
she
be
willing
to
leave
the
dean
and
chapter
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
try
his
hand
at
subvert
the
old
-
establish
custom
of
the
close
,
and
from
his
failure
she
have
learn
experience
.
<EOS>
the
burly
chancellor
and
the
meagre
little
prebendary
be
not
tease
by
any
application
respect
Sabbath
-
day
school
,
the
dean
be
leave
to
his
own
dominion
,
and
the
intercourse
between
Mrs.
Proudie
and
Mrs.
Arabin
be
confine
to
a
yearly
dinner
give
by
each
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
at
these
dinner
Dr.
grantly
will
not
take
a
part
,
but
he
never
fail
to
ask
for
and
receive
a
full
account
of
all
that
Mrs.
Proudie
either
do
or
say
.
  
<EOS>
His
ecclesiastical
authority
have
be
greatly
shorn
since
the
palmy
day
in
which
he
reign
supreme
as
mayor
of
the
palace
to
his
father
,
but
nevertheless
such
authority
as
be
now
leave
to
him
he
can
enjoy
without
interference
.
<EOS>
He
can
walk
down
the
High
Street
of
Barchester
without
feel
that
those
who
see
him
be
compare
his
claim
with
those
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
the
intercourse
between
Plumstead
and
the
deanery
be
of
the
most
constant
and
familiar
description
.
<EOS>
since
Eleanor
have
be
marry
to
a
clergyman
,
and
especially
to
a
dignitary
of
the
church
,
Mrs.
Grantly
have
find
many
more
point
of
sympathy
with
her
sister
;
and
on
a
come
occasion
,
which
be
much
look
forward
to
by
all
party
,
she
intend
to
spend
a
month
or
two
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
She
never
think
of
spend
a
month
in
Barchester
when
little
Johnny
Bold
be
bear
!
  
<EOS>
the
two
sister
do
not
quite
agree
on
matter
of
church
doctrine
,
though
their
difference
be
of
the
most
amicable
description
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arabin
's
church
be
two
degree
high
than
that
of
Mrs.
<EOS>
Grantly
.
<EOS>
this
may
seem
strange
to
those
who
will
remember
that
Eleanor
be
once
accuse
of
partiality
to
Mr.
Slope
,
but
it
be
no
less
the
fact
.
<EOS>
She
like
her
husband
's
silken
vest
,
she
like
his
adherence
to
the
rubric
,
she
specially
like
the
eloquent
philosophy
of
his
sermon
,
and
she
like
the
red
letter
in
her
own
prayer
-
book
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
presume
that
she
have
a
taste
for
candle
,
or
that
she
be
at
all
astray
about
the
real
presence
,
but
she
have
an
inkling
that
way
.
<EOS>
She
send
a
handsome
subscription
towards
certain
very
heavy
ecclesiastical
legal
expense
which
have
lately
be
incur
in
Bath
,
her
name
of
course
not
appear
;
she
assume
a
smile
of
gentle
ridicule
when
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
be
name
;
and
she
have
put
up
a
memorial
window
in
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
belong
to
the
high
and
dry
church
,
the
High
Church
as
it
be
some
fifty
year
since
,
before
tract
be
write
and
young
clergyman
take
upon
themselves
the
highly
meritorious
duty
of
clean
church
,
rather
laugh
at
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
shrug
her
shoulder
and
tell
Miss
Thorne
that
she
suppose
Eleanor
will
have
an
oratory
in
the
deanery
before
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
on
that
account
a
whit
displease
.
<EOS>
a
few
High
Church
vagary
do
not
,
she
think
,
sit
amiss
on
the
shoulder
of
a
young
dean
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
show
at
any
rate
that
her
heart
be
in
the
subject
,
and
it
show
moreover
that
she
be
remove
,
wide
as
the
pole
asunder
,
from
that
cesspool
of
abomination
in
which
it
be
once
suspect
that
she
would
wallow
and
grovel
.
<EOS>
Anathema
maranatha
!
<EOS>
let
anything
else
be
hold
as
bless

so
that
that

well
curse

<EOS>
welcome
kneeling
and
bowing
,
welcome
matin
and
compline
,
welcome
bell

and
candle

so
that
Mr.
Slope
's
dirty
surplice
and
ceremonial
sabbath
be

in
due
execration
!

if
it
be
essentially
and
absolutely
necessary
to
choose
between
the
two
,
we
be
inclined
to
agree
with
Mrs.
Grantly
that
the
bell
,
book
,
and
candle
be
the
less
evil
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
let
it
however
be
understand
that
no
such
necessity
be
admit
in
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Arabin
(
we
suppose
he
must
have
become
a
doctor
when
he
become
a
dean
)
be
more
moderate
and
less
outspoken
on
doctrinal
point
than
his
wife
,
as
indeed
in
his
station
it
behove
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
studious
,
thoughtful
,
hard
-
working
man
.
<EOS>
He
live
constantly
at
the
deanery
and
preach
nearly
every
Sunday
.
<EOS>
His
time
be
spend
in
sift
and
edit
old
ecclesiastical
literature
and
in
produce
the
same
article
new
.
<EOS>
at
Oxford
he
be
generally
regard
as
the
most
promising
clerical
ornament
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
live
together
in
perfect
mutual
confidence
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
secret
in
her
bosom
which
he
have
not
share
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
yet
learn
how
Mr.
Slope
have
his
ear
box
.
  
<EOS>
the
Stanhopes
soon
find
that
Mr.
Slope
's
power
need
no
longer
operate
to
keep
them
from
the
delight
of
their
italian
villa
.
<EOS>
before
Eleanor
's
marriage
they
have
all
migrate
back
to
the
shore
of
Como
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
resettle
long
before
the
signora
receive
from
Mrs.
Arabin
a
very
pretty
though
very
short
epistle
,
in
which
she
be
inform
of
the
fate
of
the
writer
.
<EOS>
this
letter
be
answer
by
another
 
bright
,
charming
,
and
witty
,
as
the
signora
's
letter
always
be
 
and
so
end
the
friendship
between
Eleanor
and
the
Stanhopes
.
  
<EOS>
one
word
of
Mr.
Harding
,
and
we
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
precentor
of
Barchester
and
still
pastor
of
the
little
church
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
what
he
have
so
often
say
himself
,
he
be
not
even
yet
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
He
do
such
duty
as
fall
to
his
lot
well
and
conscientiously
,
and
be
thankful
that
he
have
never
be
tempt
to
assume
other
for
which
he
may
be
less
fit
.
  
<EOS>
the
author
now
leave
him
in
the
hand
of
his
reader
:
not
as
a
hero
,
not
as
a
man
to
be
admire
and
talk
of
,
not
as
a
man
who
should
be
toast
at
public
dinner
and
speak
of
with
conventional
absurdity
as
a
perfect
divine
,
but
as
a
good
man
,
without
guile
,
believe
humbly
in
the
religion
which
he
have
strive
to
teach
,
and
guide
by
the
precept
which
he
have
strive
to
learn
.
