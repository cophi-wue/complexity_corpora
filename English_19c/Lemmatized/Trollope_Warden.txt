the
Rev.
Septimus
Harding
be
,
a
few
year
since
,
a
benefice
clergyman
reside
in
the
cathedral
town
of
---
;
let
us
call
it
Barchester
.
<EOS>
be
we
to
name
Wells
or
Salisbury
,
Exeter
,
Hereford
,
or
Gloucester
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
presume
that
something
personal
be
intend
;
and
as
this
tale
will
refer
mainly
to
the
cathedral
dignitary
of
the
town
in
question
,
we
be
anxious
that
no
personality
may
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
let
us
presume
that
Barchester
be
a
quiet
town
in
the
West
of
England
,
more
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
its
cathedral
and
the
antiquity
of
its
monument
than
for
any
commercial
prosperity
;
that
the
west
end
of
Barchester
be
the
cathedral
close
,
and
that
the
aristocracy
of
Barchester
be
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
canon
,
with
their
respective
wife
and
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
life
Mr
Harding
find
himself
locate
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
a
fine
voice
and
a
taste
for
sacred
music
have
decide
the
position
in
which
he
be
to
exercise
his
calling
,
and
for
many
year
he
perform
the
easy
but
not
highly
pay
duty
of
a
minor
canon
.
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
forty
a
small
living
in
the
close
vicinity
of
the
town
increase
both
his
work
and
his
income
,
and
at
the
age
of
fifty
he
become
precentor
of
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
have
marry
early
in
life
,
and
be
the
father
of
two
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
eld
,
Susan
,
be
bear
soon
after
his
marriage
;
the
other
,
Eleanor
,
not
till
ten
year
later
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
at
which
we
introduce
him
to
our
reader
he
be
live
as
precentor
at
Barchester
with
his
young
daughter
,
then
twenty
-
four
year
of
age
;
have
be
many
year
a
widower
,
and
have
marry
his
eld
daughter
to
a
son
of
the
bishop
a
very
short
time
before
his
installation
to
the
office
of
precentor
.
  
<EOS>
scandal
at
Barchester
affirm
that
have
it
not
be
for
the
beauty
of
his
daughter
<EOS>
,
Mr
Harding
would
have
remain
a
minor
canon
;
but
here
probably
Scandal
lie
,
as
she
so
often
do
;
for
even
as
a
minor
canon
no
one
have
be
more
popular
among
his
reverend
brother
in
the
close
than
Mr
Harding
;
and
Scandal
,
before
she
have
reprobate
Mr
Harding
for
be
make
precentor
by
his
friend
the
bishop
,
have
loudly
blame
the
bishop
for
have
so
long
omit
to
do
something
for
his
friend
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
Susan
Harding
,
some
twelve
year
since
,
have
marry
the
Rev.
Dr
Theophilus
Grantly
,
son
of
the
bishop
,
archdeacon
of
Barchester
,
and
rector
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
her
father
become
,
a
few
month
later
,
precentor
of
Barchester
Cathedral
,
<EOS>
that
office
be
,
as
be
not
unusual
,
in
the
bishop
's
gift
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
peculiar
circumstance
connect
with
the
precentorship
which
must
be
explain
.
<EOS>
in
the
year
1434
there
die
at
Barchester
one
John
Hiram
,
who
have
make
money
in
the
town
as
a
wool
-
stapler
,
and
in
his
will
he
leave
the
house
in
which
he
die
and
certain
meadow
and
close
near
the
town
,
still
call
Hiram
's
Butts
,
and
<EOS>
Hiram
's
Patch
,
for
the
support
of
twelve
superannuate
wool
-
carder
,
all
of
whom
should
have
be
bear
and
breed
and
spend
their
day
in
Barchester
<EOS>
;
he
also
appoint
that
an
alms
-
house
should
be
build
for
their
abode
,
with
a
fitting
residence
for
a
warden
,
which
warden
be
also
to
receive
a
certain
sum
annually
out
of
the
rent
of
the
say
butts
and
patch
.
<EOS>
He
,
moreover
,
will
,
have
have
a
soul
alive
to
harmony
,
that
the
precentor
of
the
cathedral
should
have
the
option
of
be
also
warden
of
the
almshouse
,
if
the
bishop
in
each
case
approve
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
day
to
this
the
charity
have
go
on
and
prosper
 
at
least
,
the
charity
have
go
on
,
and
the
estate
have
prosper
.
<EOS>
wool
-
card
in
Barchester
<EOS>
there
be
no
longer
any
;
so
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
warden
,
who
take
it
in
turn
to
put
in
the
old
man
,
generally
appoint
some
hanger
-
on
of
their
own
;
wear

out

decrepit

or
octogenarian
sexton

who
thankfully
receive
a
comfortable
lodging
and
one
shilling

fourpence
a

,
such
be
the
stipend
to
which
,
under
the
will
of
John
Hiram
,
they
be
declare
to
be
entitle
.
<EOS>
formerly
,
indeed
,
 
that
is
,
till
within
some
fifty
year
of
the
present
time
,
 
they
receive
but
sixpence
a
day
,
and
their
breakfast
and
dinner
be
find
them
at
a
common
table
by
the
warden
,
<EOS>
such
an
arrangement
be
in
strict
conformity
with
the
absolute
wording
of
old
Hiram
's
will
:
but
this
be
think
to
be
inconvenient
,
and
to
suit
the
taste
of
neither
warden
nor
bedesman
,
and
the
daily
one
shilling
and
fourpence
be
substitute
with
the
common
consent
of
all
party
,
include
the
bishop
and
the
corporation
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
condition
of
Hiram
's
twelve
old
man
when
Mr
Harding
be
appoint
warden
;
but
if
they
may
be
consider
as
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
accord
to
their
condition
,
the
happy
warden
be
much
more
so
.
<EOS>
the
patch
and
butts
which
,
in
John
Hiram
's
time
,
produce
hay
or
fed
cow
,
be
now
cover
with
row
of
house
;
the
value
of
the
property
have
gradually
increase
from
year
to
year
and
century
to
century
,
and
be
now
presume
by
those
who
know
anything
about
it
,
to
bring
in
a
very
nice
income
;
and
by
some
who
know
nothing
about
it
,
to
have
increase
to
an
almost
fabulous
extent
.
  
<EOS>
the
property
be
farm
by
a
gentleman
in
Barchester
,
who
also
act
as
the
bishop
's
steward
,
 
a
man
whose
father
and
grandfather
have
be
steward
to
the
bishop
of
Barchester
,
and
farmer
of
John
Hiram
's
estate
.
<EOS>
the
Chadwicks
have
earn
a
good
name
in
Barchester
;
they
have
live
respect
by
bishop
,
dean
,
canon
,
and
precentor
;
they
have
be
bury
in
the
precinct
of
the
cathedral
;
they
have
never
be
know
as
griping
,
hard
man
,
but
have
always
live
comfortably
,
maintain
a
good
house
,
and
hold
a
high
position
in
Barchester
society
.
<EOS>
the
present
Mr
Chadwick
be
a
worthy
scion
of
a
worthy
stock
,
and
the
tenant
live
on
the
butts
and
patch
,
as
well
as
those
on
the
wide
episcopal
domain
of
the
see
,
be
well
pleased
to
have
to
do
with
so
worthy
and
liberal
a
steward
.
  
<EOS>
for
many
,
many
year
,
 
record
hardly
tell
how
many
,
probably
from
the
time
when
Hiram
's
wish
have
be
first
fully
carry
out
,
 
the
proceed
of
the
estate
have
be
pay
by
the
steward
or
farmer
to
the
warden
,
and
by
him
divide
among
the
bedesman
;
after
which
division
he
pay
himself
such
sum
as
become
his
due
.
<EOS>
time
have
be
when
the
poor
warden
get
nothing
but
his
bare
house
,
for
the
patch
have
be
subject
to
flood
,
and
the
land
of
Barchester
butts
be
say
to
be
unproductive
;
and
in
these
hard
time
the
warden
be
hardly
able
to
make
out
the
daily
dole
for
his
twelve
dependent
.
<EOS>
but
by
degree
thing
mend
;
the
patch
be
drain
,
and
cottage
begin
to
rise
upon
the
butts
,
and
the
warden
,
with
fairness
enough
,
repay
themselves
for
the
evil
day
go
by
.
<EOS>
in
bad
time
the
poor
man
have
have
their
due
,
and
therefore
in
good
time
they
could
expect
no
more
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
the
income
of
the
warden
have
increase
;
the
picturesque
house
attach
to
the
hospital
have
be
enlarge
and
adorn
,
and
the
office
have
become
one
of
the
most
coveted
of
the
snug
clerical
sinecure
attach
to
our
church
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
wholly
in
the
bishop
's
gift
,
and
though
the
dean
and
chapter
,
in
former
day
,
make
a
stand
on
the
subject
,
they
have
think
it
more
conducive
to
their
honour
to
have
a
rich
precentor
appoint
by
the
bishop
,
than
a
poor
one
appoint
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
stipend
of
the
precentor
of
Barchester
be
eighty
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
the
income
arise
from
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
be
eight
hundred
,
besides
the
value
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Murmurs
,
very
slight
murmur
,
have
be
hear
in
Barchester
,
 
few
indeed
,
and
far
between
,
 
that
the
proceed
of
John
Hiram
's
property
have
not
be
fairly
divide
:
but
they
can
hardly
be
say
to
have
be
of
such
a
nature
as
to
have
cause
uneasiness
to
anyone
:
still
the
thing
have
be
whisper
,
and
Mr
Harding
have
hear
it
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
character
in
Barchester
,
so
universal
be
his
popularity
,
that
the
very
fact
of
his
appointment
would
have
quiet
loud
whisper
than
those
which
have
be
hear
;
but
Mr
Harding
be
an
open
-
handed
,
just
-
minded
man
,
and
feel
that
there
may
be
truth
in
what
have
be
say
,
he
have
,
on
his
instalment
,
declare
his
intention
of
add
twopence
a
day
to
each
man
's
pittance
,
make
a
sum
of
sixty
-
two
pound
eleven
shilling
and
fourpence
,
which
he
be
to
pay
out
of
his
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
however
,
he
distinctly
and
repeatedly
observe
to
the
man
,
that
though
he
promise
for
himself
,
he
could
not
promise
for
his
successor
,
and
that
the
extra
twopence
could
only
be
look
on
as
a
gift
from
himself
,
and
not
from
the
trust
.
<EOS>
the
bedesman
,
however
,
be
most
of
them
old
than
Mr
Harding
,
and
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
security
on
which
their
extra
income
be
base
.
  
<EOS>
this
munificence
on
the
part
of
Mr
Harding
have
not
be
unopposed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
have
mildly
but
seriously
dissuade
him
from
it
;
and
his
strong
-
minded
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
,
the
man
of
whom
alone
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
stand
in
awe
,
have
urgently
,
nay
,
vehemently
,
oppose
so
impolitic
a
concession
:
but
the
warden
have
make
know
his
intention
to
the
hospital
before
the
archdeacon
have
be
able
to
interfere
,
and
the
deed
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
Hiram
's
Hospital
,
as
the
retreat
be
call
,
be
a
picturesque
building
enough
,
and
show
the
correct
taste
with
which
the
ecclesiastical
architect
of
those
day
be
imbue
.
<EOS>
It

the
bank
of
the
little
river

which
flow
nearly
round
the
cathedral
close

<EOS>
the
London
road
cross
the
river
by
a
pretty
one

arched
bridge

and
,
look
from
this
bridge

the
stranger
will
see
the
window
of
the
old
man

room

each
pair

a
small
buttress

<EOS>
a
broad
gravel
walk

between
the
building
and
the
river

which
be
always
trim

and
at

in

three

<EOS>
beyond

<EOS>
the
entrance
to
the
hospital
be
from
the
London
road
,
and
be
make
through
a
ponderous
gateway
under
a
heavy
stone
arch
,
unnecessary
,
one
would
suppose
,
at
any
time
,
for
the
protection
of
twelve
old

but
greatly
conducive
to
the
good
appearance
of
Hiram

charity
.

on

never
close

except
on
application

intricately
hang
mediæval
bell

slight
iron
screen

through
which
the
more
happy
portion
of
the
Barchester
elite
pass
into
the
Elysium
of
Mr
Harding
's
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
a
small
man
,
now
verge
on
sixty
year
,
but
bear
few
of
the
sign
of
age
;
his
hair
be
rather
grizzle
,
though
not
gray
;
his
eye
be
very
mild
,
but
clear
and
bright
,
though
the
double
glass
which
be
hold
swinge
from
his
hand
,
unless
when
fix
upon
his
nose
,
show
that
time
have
tell
upon
his
sight
;
his
hand
be
delicately
white
,
and
both
hand
and
foot
be
small
;
he
always
wear
a
black
frock
coat
,
black
knee
-
breech
,
and
black
gaiter
,
and
somewhat
scandalise
some
of
his
more
hyperclerical
brother
by
a
black
neck
-
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
warm
admirer
can
not
say
that
he
be
ever
an
industrious
man
;
the
circumstance
of
his
life
have
not
call
on
him
to
be
so
;
and
yet
he
can
hardly
be
call
an
idler
.
<EOS>
since
his
appointment
to
his
precentorship
,
he
have
publish
,
with
all
possible
addition
of
vellum
,
typography
,
and
gilding
,
a
collection
of
our
ancient
church
music
,
with
some
correct
dissertation
on
Purcell
,
Crotch
,
and
Nares
.
<EOS>
He
have
greatly
improve
the
choir
of
Barchester
,
which
,
under
his
dominion
,
now
rival
that
of
any
cathedral
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
something
more
than
his
fair
share
in
the
cathedral
service
,
and
have
play
the
violoncello
daily
to
such
audience
as
he
could
collect
,
or
,
_
faute
de
mieux
_
,
to
no
audience
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
mention
one
other
peculiarity
of
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
before
state
,
he
have
an
income
of
eight
hundred
a
year
,
and
have
no
family
but
his
one
daughter
;
and
yet
he
be
never
quite
at
ease
in
money
matter
.
<EOS>
the
vellum
and
gilding
of
"
Harding
's
Church
music
"
cost
more
than
any
one
know
,
except
the
author
,
the
publisher
,
and
the
Rev.
Theophilus
Grantly
,
who
allow
none
of
his
father
-
in

He

no

with

<EOS>
Mr

should

as
the

,
at

he

the

reformer
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
have
be
now
precentor
of
Barchester
for
ten
year
;
and
,
alas
,
the
murmur
respect
the
proceed
of
Hiram
's
estate
be
again
become
audible
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
any
one
begrudge
to
Mr
Harding
the
income
which
he
enjoy
,
and
the
comfortable
place
which
so
well
become
him
;
but
such
matter
have
begin
to
be
talk
of
in
various
part
of
England
.
<EOS>
eager
pushing
politician
have
assert
in
the
House

Commons
,
with
very
telling
indignation
,
that
the

priest
of

which
the
charity
of

have
leave
for
the

of

or
the

<EOS>
the
well
-
know
case
of
the
Hospital
of
St

have
even
come
before
the
law
court
of
the
country
,
and
the
struggle
of
Mr
Whiston
,
at
Rochester
,
have
meet
with
sympathy
and
support
.
<EOS>
man
be
begin
to
say
that
these
thing
must
be
look
into
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
whose
conscience
in
the
matter
be
clear
,
and
who
have
never
feel
that
he
have
receive
a
pound
from
Hiram
's
will
to
which
he
be
not
entitle
,
have
naturally
take
the
part
of
the
church
in
talk
over
these
matter
with
his
friend
,
the
bishop
,
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
indeed
,
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
,
have
be
somewhat
loud
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
personal
friend
of
the
dignitary
of
the
Rochester
Chapter
,
and
have
write
letter
in
the
public
press
on
the
subject
of
that
turbulent
<EOS>
Dr
Whiston
,
which
,
his
admirer
think
,
must
well
nigh
set
the
question
at
rest
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
know
at
Oxford
that
he
be
the
author
of
the
pamphlet
sign
"
Sacerdos
"
on
the
subject
of
the
Earl
of
Guildford
and
St
Cross
,
in
which
it
be
so
clearly
argue
that
the
manner
of
the
present
time
do
not
admit
of
a
literal
adhesion
to
the
very
word
of
the
founder
's
will
,
but
that
the
interest
of
the
church
for
which
the
founder
be
so
deeply
concerned
be
best
consult
in
enable
its
bishop
to
reward
those
shine
light
whose
service
have
be
most
signally
serviceable
to
Christianity
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
,
it
be
assert
that
Henry
de
Blois
,
founder
of
St
Cross
,
be
not
greatly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
reformed
church
,
and
that
the
master
of
St
Cross
,
for
many
year
past
,
can
not
be
call
shine
light
in
the
service
of
Christianity
;
it
be
,
however
,
stoutly
maintain
,
and
no
doubt
feel
,
by
all
the
archdeacon
's
friend
,
that
his
logic
be
conclusive
,
and
have
not
,
in
fact
,
be
answer
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
a
tower
of
strength
to
back
both
his
argument
and
his
conscience
,
it
may
be
imagine
that
Mr
Harding
have
never
feel
any
compunction
as
to
receive
his
quarterly
sum
of
two
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
subject
have
never
present
itself
to
his
mind
in
that
shape
.
<EOS>
He
have
talk
not
unfrequently
,
and
hear
very
much
about
the
will
of
old
founder
and
the
income
arise
from
their
estate
,
during
the
last
year
or
two
;
he
do
even
,
at
one
moment
,
feel
a
doubt
(
since
expel
by
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
logic
)
as
to
whether
Lord
Guildford
be
clearly
entitle
to
receive
so
enormous
an
income
as
he
do
from
the
revenue
of
St
Cross
;
but
that
he
himself
be
overpay
with
his
modest
eight
hundred
pound
,
 
he
who
,
out
of
that
,
voluntarily
give
up
sixty
-
two
pound
eleven
shilling
and
fourpence
a
year
to
his
twelve
old
neighbour
,
 
he
who
,
for
the
money
,
do
his
precentor
's
work
as
no
precentor
have
do
it
before
,
since
Barchester
Cathedral
be
build
,
 
such
an
idea
have
never
sully
his
quiet
,
or
disturb
his
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mr
Harding
be
become
uneasy
at
the
rumour
which
he
know
to
prevail
in
Barchester
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
,
at
any
rate
,
two
of
his
old
man
have
be
hear
to
say
,
that
if
everyone
have
his
own
,
they
may
each
have
their
hundred
pound
a
year
,
and
live
like
gentleman
,
instead
of
a
beggarly
one
shilling
and
sixpence
a
day
;
and
that
they
have
slend
cause
to
be
thankful
for
a
miserable
dole
of
twopence
,
when
Mr
Harding
and
Mr
Chadwick
,
between
them
,
run
away
with
thousand
of
pound
which
good
old
John
Hiram
never
intend
for
the
like
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
ingratitude
of
this
which
sting
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
one
of
this
discontent
pair
,
Abel
Handy
,
be
put
into
the
hospital
by
himself
;
he
have
be
a
stone
-
mason
in
Barchester
,
and
have
break
his
thigh
by
a
fall
from
a
scaffolding
,
while
employ
about
the
cathedral
;
and
Mr
Harding
have
give
him
the
first
vacancy
in
the
hospital
after
the
occurrence
,
although
Dr
grantly
have
be
very
anxious
to
put
into
it
an
insufferable
clerk
of
his
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
who
have
lose
all
his
tooth
,
and
whom
the
archdeacon
hardly
know
how
to
get
rid
of
by
other
mean
.
<EOS>
Dr
grantly
have
not
forget
to
remind
Mr
Harding
<EOS>
how
well
satisfied
with
his
one
-
and
-
sixpence
a
day
old
Joe
Mutters
would
have
be
,
and
how
injudicious
it
be
on
the
part
of
Mr
Harding
to
allow
a
radical
from
the
town
to
get
into
the
concern
.
<EOS>
probably
Dr
grantly
forget
,
at
the
moment
,
that
the
charity
be
intend
for
break
-
down
journeyman
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
live
at
Barchester
,
a
young
man
,
a
surgeon
,
name
John
Bold
,
and
both
Mr
Harding
and
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
be
well
aware
that
to
him
be
<EOS>
owe
the
pestilent
rebellious
feeling
which
have
show
itself
in
the
hospital
;
yes
,
and
the
renewal
,
too
,
of
that
disagreeable
talk
about
Hiram
's
estate
which
be
now
again
prevalent
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mr
Harding
and
Mr
Bold
be
acquaint
with
each
other
;
we
may
say
,
be
friend
,
consider
the
great
disparity
in
their
year
.
<EOS>
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
,
however
,
have
a
holy
horror
of
the
impious
demagogue
,
as
on
one
occasion
he
call
Bold
,
when
speak
of
him
to
the
precentor
;
and
be
a
more
prudent
far
-
see
man
than
Mr
Harding
,
and
possess
of
a
strong
head
,
he
already
perceive
that
this
John
Bold
will
work
great
trouble
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
consider
that
he
be
to
be
regard
as
an
enemy
,
and
think
that
he
should
not
be
admit
into
the
camp
on
anything
like
friendly
term
.
<EOS>
as
John
Bold
will
occupy
much
of
our
attention
,
we
must
endeavour
to
explain
who
he
be
,
and
why
he
take
the
part
of
John
Hiram
's
bedesman
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
be
a
young
surgeon
,
who
pass
many
of
his
boyish
year
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
father
be
a
physician
in
the
city
of
London
,
where
he
make
a
moderate
fortune
,
which
he
invest
in
house
in
that
city
.
<EOS>
the
Dragon
of
wantly
inn
and
post
-
house
belong
to
him
,
also
four
shop
in
the
High
Street
,
and
a
moiety
of
the
new
row
of
genteel
villa
(
so
call
in
the
advertisement
)
,
build
outside
the
town
just
beyond
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
to
one
of
these
Dr
Bold
retire
to
spend
the
evening
of
his
life
,
and
to
die
;
and
here
his
son
John
spend
his
holiday
,
and
afterwards
his
Christmas
vacation
when
he
go
from
school
to
study
surgery
in
the
London
hospital
.
<EOS>
just
as
John
Bold
be
entitle
to
write
himself
surgeon
and
apothecary
,
old
Dr
Bold
die
,
leave
his
Barchester
property
to
his
son
,
and
a
certain
sum
in
the
three
per
cent
.
<EOS>
to
his
daughter
Mary
,
who
be
some
four
or
five
year
old
than
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
determine
to
settle
himself
at
Barchester
,
and
look
after
his
own
property
,
as
well
as
the
bone
and
body
of
such
of
his
neighbour
as
would
call
upon
him
for
assistance
in
their
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
put
up
a
large
brass
plate
with
"
John
Bold
,
Surgeon
"
on
it
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
nine
practitioner
who
be
already
try
to
get
a
living
out
of
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
canon
;
and
begin
house
-
keeping
with
the
aid
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
he
be
not
more
than
twenty
-
four
year
old
;
and
though
he
have
now
be
three
year
in
Barchester
,
we
have
not
hear
that
he
have
do
much
harm
to
the
nine
worthy
practitioner
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
their
dread
of
him
have
die
away
;
for
in
three
year
he
have
not
take
three
fee
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
John
Bold
be
a
clever
man
,
and
would
,
with
practice
,
be
a
clever
surgeon
;
but
he
have
get
quite
into
another
line
of
life
.
<EOS>
have
enough
to
live
on
,
he
have
not
be
force
to
work
for
bread
;
he
have
decline
to
subject
himself
to
what
he
call
the
drudgery
of
the
profession
,
by
which
,
I
believe
,
he
mean
the
general
work
of
a
practise
surgeon
;
and
have
find
other
employment
.
<EOS>
He
frequently
bind
up
the
bruise
and
set
the
limb
of
such
of
the
poor
class
as
profess
his
way
of
thinking
,
 
but
this
he
do
for
love
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
not
say
that
the
archdeacon
be
strictly
correct
in
stigmatise
John
Bold
as
a
demagogue
,
for
I
hardly
know
how
extreme
must
be
a
man
's
opinion
before
he
can
be
justly
so
call
;
but
Bold
be
a
strong
reformer
.
<EOS>
His
passion
be
the
reform
of
all
abuse
;
state
abuse
,
church
abuse
,
corporation
abuse
(
he
have
get
himself
elect
a
town
councillor
of
Barchester
,
and
have
so
worry
three
consecutive
mayor
,
that
it
become
somewhat
difficult
to
find
a
fourth
)
,
abuse
in
medical
practice
,
and
general
abuse
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
Bold
be
thoroughly
sincere
in
his
patriotic
endeavour
to
mend
mankind
,
and
there
be
something
to
be
admire
in
the
energy
with
which
he
devote
himself
to
remedy
evil
and
stop
injustice
;
but
I
fear
that
he
be
too
much
imbue
with
the
idea
that
he
have
a
special
mission
for
reform
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
if
one
so
young
have
a
little
more
diffidence
himself
,
and
more
trust
in
the
honest
purpose
of
other
,
 
if
he
could
be
bring
to
believe
that
old
custom
need
not
necessarily
be
evil
,
and
that
change
may
possibly
be
dangerous
;
but
no
,
Bold
have
all
the
ardour
and
all
the
self
-
assurance
of
a
Danton
,
and
hurls
his
anathema
against
time
-
honour
practice
with
the
violence
of
a
French
Jacobin
.
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
Dr
grantly
should
regard
Bold
as
a
firebrand
,
fall
,
as
he
have
do
,
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
quiet
ancient
close
of
Barchester
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
Dr
grantly
would
have
him
avoid
as
the
plague
;
but
the
old
Doctor
and
Mr
Harding
be
fast
friend
.
<EOS>
young
Johnny
Bold
use
to
play
as
a
boy
on
Mr
Harding
's
lawn
;
he
have
many
a
time
win
the
precentor
's
heart
by
listen
with
rapt
attention
to
his
sacred
strain
;
and
since
those
day
,
to
tell
the
truth
at
once
,
he
have
nearly
win
another
heart
within
the
same
wall
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
Harding
have
not
plight
her
troth
to
John
Bold
,
nor
have
she
,
perhaps
,
own
to
herself
how
dear
to
her
<EOS>
the
young
reformer
be
;
but
she
can
not
endure
that
anyone
should
speak
harshly
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
dare
to
defend
him
when
her
brother
-
in
-
law
be
so
loud
against
him
;
for
she
,
like
her
father
,
be
somewhat
afraid
of
Dr
grantly
;
but
she
be
begin
greatly
to
dislike
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
She
persuade
her
father
that
it
would
be
both
unjust
and
injudicious
to
banish
his
young
friend
because
of
his
politic
;
she
care
little
to
go
to
house
where
she
will
not
meet
him
,
and
,
in
fact
,
she
be
in
love
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
there
any
good
reason
why
Eleanor
Harding
should
not
love
John
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
have
all
those
quality
which
be
likely
to
touch
a
girl
's
heart
.
<EOS>
He
be
brave
,
eager
,
and
amusing
;
well
-
make
and
good
-
look
;
young
and
enterprising
;
his
character
be
in
all
respect
good
;
he
have
sufficient
income
to
support
a
wife
;
he
be
her
father
's
friend
;
and
,
above
all
,
he
be
in
love
with
her
:
<EOS>
then
why
should
not
Eleanor
Harding
be
attach
to
John
Bold
?
  
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
,
who
have
as
many
eye
as
Argus
,
and
have
long
see
how
the
wind
blow
in
that
direction
,
think
there
be
various
strong
reason
why
this
should
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
think
it
wise
as
yet
to
speak
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
on
the
subject
,
for
he
know
how
foolishly
indulgent
be
Mr
Harding
in
everything
that
concern
his
daughter
;
but
he
have
discuss
the
matter
with
his
all
-
trusted
helpmate
,
within
that
sacred
recess
form
by
the
clerical
bed
-
curtain
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
how
much
sweet
solace
,
how
much
value
counsel
have
our
archdeacon
receive
within
that
saint
enclosure
!
'
<EOS>
tis
there
alone
that
he
unbend
,
and
come
down
from
his
high
church
pedestal
to
the
level
of
a
mortal
man
.
<EOS>
in
the
world
Dr
grantly
never
lay
aside
that
demeanour
which
so
well
become
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
all
the
dignity
of
an
ancient
saint
with
the
sleekness
of
a
modern
bishop
;
he
be
always
the
same
;
he
be
always
the
archdeacon
;
unlike
Homer
,
he
never
nod
.
<EOS>
even
with
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
even
with
the
bishop
and
dean
,
he
maintain
that
sonorous
tone
and
lofty
deportment
which
strike
awe
into
the
young
heart
of
Barchester
,
and
absolutely
cow
the
whole
parish
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
'
<EOS>
tis
only
when
he
have
exchange
that
ever
-
new
shovel
hat
for
a
tasselled
nightcap
,
and
those
shine
black
habiliment
for
his
accustomed
_
robe
de
nuit
_
,
that
Dr
grantly
talk
,
and
look
,
and
think
like
an
ordinary
man
.
  
<EOS>
many
of
us
have
often
think
how
severe
a
trial
of
faith
must
this
be
to
the
wife
of
our
great
church
dignitary
.
<EOS>
to
us
these
man
be
personification
of
St
Paul
;
their
very
gait
be
a
speak
sermon
;
their
clean
and
sombre
apparel
exact
from
us
faith
and
submission
,
and
the
cardinal
virtue
seem
to
hover
round
their
sacred
hat
.
<EOS>
a
dean
or
archbishop
,
in
the
garb
of
his
order
,
be
sure
of
our
reverence
,
and
a
well
-
get
-
up
bishop
fill
our
very
soul
with
awe
.
<EOS>
but
how
can
this
feeling
be
perpetuate
in
the
bosom
of
those
who
see
the
bishop
without
their
apron
,
and
the
archdeacon
even
in
a
low
state
of
dishabille
?
  
<EOS>
do
we
not
all
know
some
reverend
,
all
but
sacred
,
personage
before
whom
our
tongue
cease
to
be
loud
and
our
step
to
be
elastic
?
<EOS>
but
be
we
once
to
see
him
stretch
himself
beneath
the
bed
-
clothe
,
yawn
widely
,
and
bury
his
face
upon
his
pillow
,
we
could
chatter
before
him
as
glibly
as
before
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
.
<EOS>
from
some
such
cause
,
doubtless
,
it
arise
that
our
archdeacon
listen
to
the
counsel
of
his
wife
,
though
he
consider
himself
entitled
to
give
counsel
to
every
other
be
whom
he
meet
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
adjust
the
copious
fold
of
his
nightcap
,
"
there
be
that
John
Bold
at
your
father
be
again
to

day
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
your
father
be
very
imprudent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
imprudent
;
 
he
always
be
,
"
reply
Mrs
Grantly
,
speak
from
under
the
comfortable
bed
-
clothe
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
new

that

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

my

there
be
nothing

I
know
that

,
at
the

affair

such
imprudence
be
 
<EOS>
be
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
,
<EOS>
my

,
if
he
do
not

what
he

about

John
Bold
will
be
off
with
Eleanor

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
will
,
whether
papa
take
care
or
no
;
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
almost
scream
the
archdeacon
,
give
so
rough
a
pull
at
his
nightcap
as
almost
to
bring
it
over
his
nose
;
"
why
not
!
 
<EOS>
that
pestilent
,
interfere
upstart
,
John
Bold
;
 
the
most
vulgar
young
person
I
ever
meet
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
he
be
meddle
with
your
father
's
affair
in
a
most
uncalled
-
for
 
most
 
"
and
be
at
a
loss
for
an
epithet
sufficiently
injurious
,
he
finish
his
expression
of
horror
by
mutter
,
"
good
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
manner
that
have
be
find
very
efficacious
in
clerical
meeting
of
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
He
must
for
the
moment
have
forget
where
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
his
vulgarity
,
archdeacon
"
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Grantly
have
never
assume
a
more
familiar
term
than
this
in
address
her
husband
)
,
"
I
do
not
agree
with
you
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
like
Mr
Bold
;
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
great
deal
too
conceited
for
me
;
but
then
Eleanor
do
,
and
it
would
be
the
good
thing
in
the
world
for
papa
if
they
be
to
marry

<EOS>
Bold
would
never
trouble
himself
about
Hiram
's
hospital
if
he
be
papa
's
son
-
in
-
law

"
<EOS>
and
the
lady
turn
herself
round
under
the
bed
-
clothe
,
in
a
manner
to
which
the
doctor
be
well
accustomed
,
and
which
tell
him
,
as
plainly
as
word
,
that
as
far
as
she
be
concern
the
subject
be
over
for
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
murmur
the
doctor
again
;
 
he
be
evidently
much
put
beside
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
grantly
be
by
no
mean
a
bad
man
;
he
be
exactly
the
man
<EOS>
which
such
an
education
as
his
be
most
likely
to
form
;
his
intellect
be
sufficient
for
such
a
place
in
the
world
,
but
not
sufficient
to
put
him
in
advance
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
perform
with
a
rigid
constancy
such
of
the
duty
of
a
parish
clergyman
as
be
,
to
his
thinking
,
above
the
sphere
of
his
curate
,
but
it
be
as
an
archdeacon
that
he
shine
.
  
<EOS>
We
believe
,
as
a
general
rule
,
that
either
a
bishop
or
his
archdeacon
have
sinecure
:
where
a
bishop
work
,
archdeacon
have
but
little
to
do
,
and
_
vice
versa
_
.
<EOS>
in
the
diocese
of
Barchester
the
Archdeacon
of
Barchester
do
the
work
.
<EOS>
in
that
capacity
he
be
diligent
,
authoritative
,
and
,
as
his
friend
particularly
boast
,
judicious
.
<EOS>
His
great
fault
be
an
overbearing
assurance
of
the
virtue
and
claim
of
his
order
,
and
his
great
foible
be
an
equally
strong
confidence
in
the
dignity
of
his
own
manner
and
the
eloquence
of
his
own
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
moral
man
,
believe
the
precept
which
he
teach
,
and
believe
also
that
he
act
up
to
them
;
though
we
can
not
say
that
he
would
give
his
coat
to
the
man
who
take
his
cloak
,
or
that
he
be
prepared
to
forgive
his
brother
even
seven
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
severe
enough
in
exact
his
due
,
consider
that
any
laxity
in
this
respect
would
endanger
the
security
of
the
church
;
and
,
could
he
have
his
way
,
he
would
consign
to
darkness
and
perdition
,
not
only
every
individual
reformer
,
but
every
committee
and
every
commission
that
would
even
dare
to
ask
a
question
respect
the
appropriation
of
church
revenue
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
church
revenue
:
the
laity
admit
it
.
<EOS>
surely
the
church
be
able
to
administer
her
own
revenue
.
"
<EOS>
'
twas
thus
he
be
accustomed
to
argue
,
when
the
sacrilegious
doing
of
Lord
John
Russell
and
other
be
discuss
either
at
Barchester
or
at
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
Dr
grantly
do
not
like
John
Bold
,
and
that
his
wife
's
suggestion
that
he
should
become
closely
connected
with
such
a
man
dismay
him
.
<EOS>
to
give
him
his
due
,
the
archdeacon
never
want
courage
;
he
be
quite
willing
to
meet
his
enemy
on
any
field
and
with
any
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
have
that
belief
in
his
own
argument
that
he
feel
sure
of
success
,
could
he
only
be
sure
of
a
fair
fight
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
that
John
Bold
could
really
prove
that
the
income
of
the
hospital
be
malappropriate
;
why
,
then
,
should
peace
be
seek
for
on
such
base
term
?
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
bribe
an
unbelieving
enemy
of
the
church
with
the
sister
-
in
-
law
of
one
dignitary
and
the
daughter
of
another
 
with
a
young
lady
whose
connection
with
the
diocese
and
chapter
of
Barchester
be
so
close
as
to
give
her
an
undeniable
claim
to
a
husband
endow
with
some
of
its
sacred
wealth
!
<EOS>
when
Dr
grantly
talk
of
unbelieve
enemy
,
he
do
not
mean
to
imply
want
of
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
the
church
,
but
an
equally
dangerous
scepticism
as
to
its
purity
in
money
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
be
not
usually
deaf
to
the
claim
of
the
high
order
to
which
she
belong
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
rarely
disagree
as
to
the
tone
with
which
the
church
should
be
defend
;
how
singular
,
then
,
that
in
such
a
case
as
this
she
should
be
willing
to
succumb
!
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
again
murmur
"
good
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
as
he
lay
himself
beside
her
,
but
he
do
so
in
a
voice
audible
only
to
himself
,
and
he
repeat
it
till
sleep
relieve
him
from
deep
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
himself
have
see
no
reason
why
his
daughter
should
not
love
John
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
unobservant
of
her
feeling
,
and
perhaps
his
deep
regret
at
the
part
which
he
fear
Bold
be
about
to
take
regard
the
hospital
arise
from
the
dread
that
he
may
be
separate
from
his
daughter
,
or
that
she
may
be
separate
from
the
man
she
love
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
speak
to
Eleanor
about
her
lover
;
he
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
allude
to
such
a
subject
unconsulted
,
even
with
his
own
daughter
;
and
have
he
consider
that
he
have
grind
to
disapprove
of
Bold
,
he
would
have
remove
her
,
or
forbid
him
his
house
;
but
he
see
no
such
ground
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
have
prefer
a
second
clerical
son
-
in
-
law
,
for
Mr
Harding
,
also
,
be
attach
to
his
order
;
and
,
fail
in
that
,
he
would
at
any
rate
have
wish
that
so
near
a
connection
should
have
think
alike
with
him
on
church
matter
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
,
however
,
reject
the
man
his
daughter
love
because
he
differ
on
such
subject
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Bold
have
take
no
step
in
the
matter
in
any
way
annoying
to
Mr
Harding
personally
.
<EOS>
some
month
since
,
after
a
severe
battle
,
which
cost
him
not
a
little
money
,
he
gain
a
victory
over
a
certain
old
turnpike
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
of
whose
charge
another
old
woman
have
complain
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
get
the
Act
of
Parliament
relate
to
the
trust
,
find
that
his
_
protégée
_
have
be
wrongly
tax
,
ride
through
the
gate
himself
,
pay
the
toll
,
then
bring
an
action
against
the
gate
-
keeper
,
and
prove
that
all
people
come
up
a
certain
by
-
lane
,
and
go
down
a
certain
other
by
-
lane
,
be
toll
-
free
.
<EOS>
the
fame
of
his
success
spread
widely
abroad
,
and
he
begin
to
be
look
on
as
the
upholder
of
the
right
of
the
poor
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
not
long
after
this
success
,
he
hear
from
different
quarter
that
Hiram
's
bedesman
be
treat
as
pauper
,
whereas
the
property
to
which
they
be
,
in
effect
,
heir
be
very
large
;
and
he
be
instigate
by
the
lawyer
whom
he
have
employ
in
the
case
of
the
turnpike
to
call
upon
Mr
Chadwick
for
a
statement
as
to
the
fund
of
the
estate
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
have
often
express
his
indignation
at
the
malappropriation
of
church
fund
in
general
,
in
the
hearing
of
his
friend
the
precentor
;
but
the
conversation
have
never
refer
to
anything
at
Barchester
;
and
when
Finney
,
the
attorney
,
induce
him
to
interfere
with
the
affair
of
the
hospital
,
it
be
against
Mr
Chadwick
that
his
effort
be
to
be
direct
.
<EOS>
bold
soon
find
that
if
he
interfere
with
Mr
Chadwick
as
steward
,
he
must
also
interfere
with
Mr
Harding
as
warden
;
and
though
he
regret
the
situation
in
which
this
would
place
him
,
he
be
not
the
man
to
flinch
from
his
undertaking
from
personal
motive
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
determine
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
,
he
set
about
his
work
with
his
usual
energy
.
<EOS>
He
get
a
copy
of
John
Hiram
's
will
,
of
the
wording
of
which
he
make
himself
perfectly
master
.
<EOS>
He
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
property
,
and
as
nearly
as
he
could
the
value
of
it
;
and
make
out
a
schedule
of
what
he
be
inform
be
the
present
distribution
of
its
income
.
<EOS>
arm
with
these
particular
,
he
call
on
Mr
Chadwick
,
have
give
that
gentleman
notice
of
his
visit
;
and
ask
him
for
a
statement
of
the
income
and
expenditure
of
the
hospital
for
the
last
twenty
-
five
year
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
of
course
refuse
,
Mr
Chadwick
allege
that
he
have
no
authority
for
make
public
the
concern
of
a
property
in
managing
which
he
be
only
a
pay
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
competent
to
give
you
that
authority
,
Mr
Chadwick
?
"
ask
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
those
who
employ
me
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
say
the
steward
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
those
,
Mr
Chadwick
?
"
demand
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
beg
to
say
that
if
these
inquiry
be
make
merely
out
of
curiosity
,
he
must
decline
answer
them
:
if
Mr
Bold
have
any
ulterior
proceed
in
view
,
perhaps
it
would
be
desirable
that
any
necessary
information
should
be
seek
for
in
a
professional
way
by
a
professional
man
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
's
attorney
be
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
take
down
the
address
of
Cox
and
Cummins
,
remark
that
the
weather
be
cold
for
the
time
of
the
year
,
and
wish
Mr
Chadwick
good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
say
it
be
cold
for
June
,
and
bow
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
at
once
go
to
his
lawyer
,
Finney
.
<EOS>
now
,
Bold
be
not
very
fond
of
his
attorney
,
but
,
as
he
say
,
he
merely
want
a
man
who
know
the
form
of
law
,
and
who
would
do
what
he
be
tell
for
his
money
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
put
himself
in
the
hand
of
a
lawyer
.
<EOS>
He
want
law
from
a
lawyer
as
he
do
a
coat
from
a
tailor
,
because
he
could
not
make
it
so
well
himself
;
and
he
think
Finney
the
fit
man
in
Barchester
for
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
at
any
rate
,
he
be
right
:
Finney
be
humility
itself
.
  
<EOS>
Finney
advise
an
instant
letter
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
mindful
of
his
six
-
and
-
eightpence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
slap
at
them
at
once
,
Mr
Bold
.
<EOS>
demand
categorically
and
explicitly
<EOS>
a
full
statement
of
the
affair
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
be
to
see
Mr
Harding
first
,
"
suggest
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
by
all
mean
,
"
say
the
acquiesce
Finney
;
"
though
,
perhaps
,
as
Mr
Harding
be
no
man
of
business
,
it
may
lead
 
lead
to
some
little
difficulty
;
but
perhaps
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
I
do
not
think
see
Mr
Harding
can
do
any
harm
.
"
<EOS>
Finney
see
from
the
expression
of
his
client
's
face
that
he
intend
to
have
his
own
way
.
   
<EOS>
the
bishop
of
barchester
 
<EOS>
bold
at
once
repair
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
now
far
advanced
,
but
he
know
that
Mr
Harding
dine
in
the
summer
at
four
,
that
Eleanor
be
accustom
to
drive
in
the
evening
,
and
that
he
may
therefore
probably
find
Mr
Harding
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
between
seven
and
eight
when
he
reach
the
slight
iron
gate
lead
into
the
precentor
's
garden
,
and
though
,
as
Mr
Chadwick
observe
,
the
day
have
be
cold
for
June
,
the
evening
be
mild
,
and
soft
,
and
sweet
.
<EOS>
the
little
gate
be
open
.
<EOS>
as
he
raise
the
latch
he
hear
the
note
of
Mr
Harding
's
violoncello
from
the
far
end
of
the
garden
,
and
,
advance
before
the
house
and
across
the
lawn
,
he
find
him
play
;
 
and
not
without
an
audience
.
<EOS>
the
musician
be
seat
in
a
garden
-
chair
just
within
the
summer
-
house
,
so
as
to
allow
the
violoncello
which
he
hold
between
his
knee
to
rest
upon
the
dry
stone
flooring
;
before
him
stand
a
rough
music
desk
,
on
which
be
open
a
page
of
that
dear
sacred
book
,
that
much
-
laboured
and
much
-
loved
volume
of
church
music
,
which
have
cost
so
many
guinea
;
and
around
sat
,
and
lie
,
and
stand
,
and
lean
,
ten
of
the
twelve
old
man
who
dwelt
with
him
beneath
old
John
Hiram
's
roof
.
<EOS>
the
two
reformer
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
in
their
heart
they
be
conscious
of
any
wrong
do
or
to
be
do
to
their
mild
warden
,
but
latterly
they
have
keep
aloof
from
him
,
and
his
music
be
no
longer
to
their
taste
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
amusing
to
see
the
position
,
and
eager
listening
face
of
these
well
-
to
-
do
old
man
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
they
all
appreciate
the
music
which
they
hear
,
but
they
be
intent
on
appear
to
do
so
;
pleased
at
be
where
they
be
,
they
be
determine
,
as
far
as
in
them
lie
,
to
give
pleasure
in
return
;
and
they
be
not
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
It
gladden
the
precentor
's
heart
to
think
that
the
old
bedesman
whom
he
love
so
well
admire
the
strain
which
be
to
him
so
full
of
almost
ecstatic
joy
;
and
he
use
to
boast
that
such
be
the
air
of
the
hospital
,
as
to
make
it
a
precinct
specially
fit
for
the
worship
of
St
Cecilia
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
before
him
,
on
the
extreme
corner
of
the
bench
which
run
round
the
summer
-
house
,
sit
one
old
man
,
with
his
handkerchief
smoothly
lain
upon
his
knee
,
who
do
enjoy
the
moment
,
or
act
enjoyment
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
on
whose
large
frame
many
year
,
for
he
be
over
eighty
,
have
make
small
havoc
;
 
he
be
still
an
upright
,
burly
,
handsome
figure
,
with
an
open
,
ponderous
brow
,
round
which
cling
a
few
,
though
very
few
,
thin
gray
lock
.
<EOS>
the
coarse
black
gown
of
the
hospital
,
the
breech
,
and
buckle
shoe
become
him
well
;
and
as
he
sit
with
his
hand
fold
on
his
staff
,
and
his
chin
rest
on
his
hand
,
he
be
such
a
listener
as
most
musician
would
be
glad
to
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
this
man
be
certainly
the
pride
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
the
custom
that
one
should
be
select
as
be
to
some
extent
in
authority
over
the
other
;
and
though
Mr
Bunce
,
for
such
be
his
name
,
and
so
he
be
always
designate
by
his
inferior
brother
,
have
no
great
emolument
than
they
,
he
have
assume
,
and
well
know
how
to
maintain
,
the
dignity
of
his
elevation
.
<EOS>
the
precentor
delight
to
call
him
his
sub
-
warden
,
and
be
not
ashamed
,
occasionally
,
when
no
other
guest
be
there
,
to
bid
him
sit
down
by
the
same
parlour
fire
,
and
drink
the
full
glass
of
port
which
be
place
near
him
.
<EOS>
bunce
never
go
without
the
second
glass
,
but
no
entreaty
ever
make
him
take
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
Mr
Harding
;
you
be
too
good
,
much
too
good
,
"
he
would
always
say
,
as
the
second
glass
be
fill
;
but
when
that
be
drunk
,
and
the
half
hour
over
,
Bunce
stand
erect
,
and
with
a
benediction
which
his
patron
value
,
retire
to
his
own
abode
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
world
too
well
to
risk
the
comfort
of
such
halcyon
moment
,
by
prolong
them
till
they
be
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunce
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
be
most
strongly
opposed
to
innovation
.
<EOS>
not
even
Dr
grantly
have
a
more
holy
horror
of
those
who
would
interfere
in
the
affair
of
the
hospital
;
he
be
every
inch
a
churchman
,
and
though
he
be
not
very
fond
of
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
personally
,
that
arise
from
there
not
be
room
in
the
hospital
for
two
people
so
much
alike
as
the
doctor
and
himself
,
rather
than
from
any
dissimilarity
in
feeling
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bunce
be
incline
to
think
that
the
warden
and
himself
could
manage
the
hospital
without
further
assistance
;
and
that
,
though
the
bishop
be
the
constitutional
visitor
,
and
as
such
entitle
to
special
reverence
from
all
connect
with
John
Hiram
's
will
,
John
Hiram
never
intend
that
his
affair
should
be
interfere
with
by
an
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
,
however
,
these
care
be
off
his
mind
,
and
he
be
look
at
his
warden
,
as
though
he
think
the
music
heavenly
,
and
the
musician
hardly
less
so
.
  
<EOS>
as
Bold
walk
silently
over
the
lawn
,
Mr
Harding
do
not
at
first
perceive
him
,
and
continue
to
draw
his
bow
slowly
across
the
plaintive
wire
;
but
he
soon
find
from
his
audience
that
some
stranger
be
there
,
and
look
up
,
begin
to
welcome
his
young
friend
with
frank
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr
Harding
 
pray
do
not
let
me
disturb
you
,
"
say
Bold
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
how
fond
I
be
of
sacred
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
it
be
nothing
,
"
say
the
precentor
,
shut
up
the
book
and
then
open
it
again
as
he
see
the
delightfully
imploring
look
of
his
old
friend
Bunce
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Bunce
,
Bunce
,
Bunce
,
I
fear
that
after
all
thou
art
but
a
flatterer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
just
finish
it
then
;
it
be
a
favourite
little
bit
of
Bishop
's
;
and
then
,
Mr
Bold
,
we
will
have
a
stroll
and
a
chat
till
Eleanor
come
in
and
give
us
tea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
Bold
sit
down
on
the
soft
turf
to
listen
,
or
rather
to
think
how
,
after
such
sweet
harmony
,
he
may
best
introduce
a
theme
of
so
much
discord
,
to
disturb
the
peace
of
him
who
be
so
ready
to
welcome
him
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
bold
think
that
the
performance
be
soon
over
,
for
he
feel
that
he
have
a
somewhat
difficult
task
,
and
he
almost
regret
the
final
leave
-
taking
of
the
last
of
the
old
man
,
slow
as
they
be
in
go
through
their
adieux
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
's
heart
be
in
his
mouth
,
as
the
precentor
make
some
ordinary
but
kind
remark
as
to
the
friendliness
of
the
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
evening
call
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
worth
ten
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
formality
in
the
morning
;
real
social
talk
never
begin
till
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
dine
early
,
so
as
to
get
as
much
as
I
can
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
true
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
but
I
fear
I
have
reverse
the
order
of
thing
,
and
I
owe
you
much
apology
for
trouble
you
on
business
at
such
an
hour
;
but
it
be
on
business
that
I
have
call
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
look
blank
and
annoyed
;
there
be
something
in
the
tone
of
the
young
man
's
voice
which
tell
him
that
the
interview
be
intend
to
be
disagreeable
,
and
he
shrink
back
at
find
his
kindly
greeting
so
repulsed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
the
hospital
,
"
continue
bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
anything
I
can
tell
you
I
shall
be
most
happy
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
about
the
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
can
tell
you
nothing
,
for
I
be
as
ignorant
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
they
pay
me
£
800
a
year
.
<EOS>
go
to
Chadwick
,
he
know
all
about
the
account
;
and
now
tell
me
,
will
poor
Mary
Jones
ever
get
the
use
of
her
limb
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
she
will
,
if
she
be
careful
;
but
,
Mr
Harding
,
I
hope
you
will
not
object
to
discuss
with
me
what
I
have
to
say
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
give
a
deep
,
long
-
draw
sigh
.
<EOS>
He
do
object
,
very
strongly
object
,
to
discuss
any
such
subject
with
John
Bold
;
but
he
have
not
the
business
tact
of
Mr
Chadwick
,
and
do
not
know
how
to
relieve
himself
from
the
come
evil
;
he
sigh
sadly
,
but
make
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
great
regard
for
you
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
continue
Bold
;
"
the
true
respect
,
the
most
sincere
 
"
  
"
thank
ye
,
thank
ye
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
interjaculate
the
precentor
somewhat
impatiently
;
"
I
be
much
oblige
,
but
never
mind
that
;
I
be
as
likely
to
be
in
the
wrong
as
another
man
,
 
quite
as
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mr
Harding
,
I
must
express
what
I
feel
,
lest
you
should
think
there
be
personal
enmity
in
what
I
be
go
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
personal
enmity
!
<EOS>
go
to
do
!
<EOS>
why
,
you
be
not
go
to
cut
my
throat
,
nor
put
me
into
the
Ecclesiastical
Court
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
try
to
laugh
,
but
he
could
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
in
earnest
,
and
determine
in
his
course
,
and
could
not
make
a
joke
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
walk
on
awhile
in
silence
before
he
recommence
his
attack
,
during
which
Mr
Harding
,
who
have
still
the
bow
in
his
hand
,
play
rapidly
on
an
imaginary
violoncello
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
there
be
reason
to
think
that
John
Hiram
's
will
be
not
carry
out
to
the
letter
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
say
the
young
man
at
last
;
"
and
I
have
be
ask
to
see
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
I
have
no
objection
on
earth
;
and
now
we
need
not
say
another
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
one
word
more
,
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
Chadwick
have
refer
me
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
and
I
think
it
my
duty
to
apply
to
them
for
some
statement
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
in
what
I
do
I
may
appear
to
be
interfere
with
you
,
and
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bold
,
"
say
the
other
,
stop
,
and
speak
with
some
solemnity
,
"
if
you
act
justly
,
say
nothing
in
this
matter
but
the
truth
,
and
use
no
unfair
weapon
in
carry
out
your
purpose
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
I
presume
you
think
I
be
not
entitle
to
the
income
I
receive
from
the
hospital
,
and
that
other
be
entitled
to
it
.
<EOS>
whatever
some
may
do
,
I
shall
never
attribute
to
you
base
motive
because
you
hold
an
opinion
oppose
to
my
own
and
adverse
to
my
interest
:
<EOS>
pray
do
what
you
consider
to
be
your
duty
;
I
can
give
you
no
assistance
,
neither
will
I
offer
you
any
obstacle
.
<EOS>
let
me
,
however
,
suggest
to
you
,
that
you
can
in
no
wise
forward
your
view
nor
I
mine
,
by
any
discussion
between
us
.
<EOS>
here
come
Eleanor
and
the
pony
,
and
we
will
go
in
to
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
,
however
,
feel
that
he
could
not
sit
down
at
ease
with
Mr
Harding
and
his
daughter
after
what
have
pass
,
and
therefore
excuse
himself
with
much
awkward
apology
;
and
merely
raise
his
hat
and
bow
as
he
pass
Eleanor
and
the
pony
chair
,
leave
her
in
disappointed
amazement
at
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
demeanour
certainly
impress
Bold
with
a
full
conviction
that
the
warden
feel
that
he
stand
on
strong
ground
,
and
almost
make
him
think
that
he
be
about
to
interfere
without
due
warrant
in
the
private
affair
of
a
just
and
honourable
man
;
but
Mr
Harding
himself
be
anything
but
satisfied
with
his
own
view
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
wish
for
Eleanor
's
sake
to
think
well
of
Bold
and
to
like
him
,
and
yet
he
could
not
but
feel
disgusted
at
the
arrogance
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
what
right
have
he
to
say
that
John
Hiram
's
will
be
not
fairly
carry
out
?
<EOS>
but
then
the
question
would
arise
within
his
heart
,
 
<EOS>
be
that
will
fairly
act
on
?
<EOS>
do
John
Hiram
mean
that
the
warden
of
his
hospital
should
receive
considerably
more
out
of
the
legacy
than
all
the
twelve
old
man
together
for
whose
behoof
the
hospital
be
build
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
John
Bold
be
right
,
and
that
the
reverend
warden
of
the
hospital
have
be
for
the
last
ten
year
and
more
the
unjust
recipient
of
an
income
legally
and
equitably
belong
to
other
?
<EOS>
what
if
it
should
be
prove
before
the
light
of
day
that
he
,
whose
life
have
be
so
happy
,
so
quiet
,
so
respected
,
have
absorb
eight
thousand
pound
to
which
he
have
no
title
,
and
which
he
could
never
repay
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
he
fear
that
such
be
really
the
case
;
but
the
first
shade
of
doubt
now
fall
across
his
mind
,
and
from
this
evening
,
for
many
a
long
,
long
day
,
our
good
,
kind
loving
warden
be
neither
happy
nor
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
thought
of
this
kind
,
these
first
moment
of
much
misery
,
oppress
Mr
Harding
as
he
sit
sip
his
tea
,
absent
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
feel
that
all
be
not
right
,
but
her
idea
as
to
the
cause
of
the
evening
's
discomfort
do
not
go
beyond
her
lover
,
and
his
sudden
and
uncivil
departure
.
<EOS>
She
think
there
must
have
be
some
quarrel
between
Bold
and
her
father
,
and
she
be
half
angry
with
both
,
though
she
do
not
attempt
to
explain
to
herself
why
she
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
think
long
and
deeply
over
these
thing
,
both
before
he
go
to
bed
and
after
it
,
as
he
lie
awake
,
question
within
himself
the
validity
of
his
claim
to
the
income
which
he
enjoy
.
<EOS>
It
seem
clear
at
any
rate
that
,
however
unfortunate
he
may
be
at
have
be
place
in
such
a
position
,
no
one
could
say
that
he
ought
either
to
have
refuse
the
appointment
first
,
or
to
have
reject
the
income
afterwards
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
,
 
mean
the
ecclesiastical
world
as
confine
to
the
english
church
<EOS>
,
 
know
that
the
wardenship
of
the
Barchester
Hospital
be
a
snug
sinecure
,
but
no
one
have
ever
be
blame
for
accept
it
.
<EOS>
to
how
much
blame
,
however
,
would
he
have
be
open
have
he
reject
it
!
<EOS>
how
mad
would
he
have
be
think
have
he
declare
,
when
the
situation
be
vacant
and
offer
to
him
,
that
he
have
scruple
as
to
receive
£
800
a
year
from
John
Hiram
's
property
,
and
that
he
have
rather
some
stranger
should
possess
it
!
<EOS>
how
would
Dr
grantly
have
shake
his
wise
head
,
and
have
consult
with
his
friend
in
the
close
as
to
some
decent
retreat
for
the
come
insanity
of
the
poor
minor
canon
!
<EOS>
if
he
be
right
in
accept
the
place
,
it
be
clear
to
him
also
that
he
would
be
wrong
in
reject
any
part
of
the
income
attach
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
patronage
be
a
valuable
appanage
of
the
bishopric
;
and
surely
it
would
not
be
his
duty
to
lessen
the
value
of
that
preferment
which
have
be
bestow
on
himself
;
surely
he
be
bind
to
stand
by
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
but
somehow
these
argument
,
though
they
seem
logical
,
be
not
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
John
Hiram
's
will
fairly
carry
out
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
true
question
:
and
if
not
,
be
it
not
his
especial
duty
to
see
that
this
be
do
,
 
<EOS>
his
especial
duty
,
whatever
injury
it
may
do
to
his
order
,
 
however
ill
such
duty
may
be
receive
by
his
patron
and
his
friend
?
<EOS>
at
the
idea
of
his
friend
,
his
mind
turn
unhappily
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
how
strongly
he
would
be
support
by
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
,
if
he
could
bring
himself
to
put
his
case
into
the
archdeacon
's
hand
and
to
allow
him
to
fight
the
battle
;
<EOS>
but
he
know
also
that
he
would
find
no
sympathy
there
for
his
doubt
,
no
friendly
feeling
,
no
inward
comfort
.
<EOS>
Dr
grantly
would
be
ready
enough
to
take
up
his
cudgel
against
all
comer
on
behalf
of
the
church
militant
,
but
he
would
do
so
on
the
distasteful
ground
of
the
church
's
infallibility
.
<EOS>
such
a
contest
would
give
no
comfort
to
Mr
Harding
's
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
anxious
to
prove
himself
right
,
as
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
before
that
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
be
the
work
man
of
the
diocese
,
and
that
his
father
the
bishop
be
somewhat
inclined
to
an
idle
life
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
;
but
the
bishop
,
though
he
have
never
be
an
active
man
,
be
one
whose
quality
have
render
him
dear
to
all
who
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
very
opposite
to
his
son
;
he
be
a
bland
and
a
kind
old
man
,
oppose
by
every
feeling
to
authoritative
demonstration
and
episcopal
ostentation
.
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
well
for
him
,
in
his
situation
,
that
his
son
have
early
in
life
be
able
to
do
that
which
he
could
not
well
do
when
he
be
young
,
and
which
he
could
not
have
do
at
all
now
that
he
be
over
seventy
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
know
how
to
entertain
the
clergy
of
his
diocese
,
to
talk
easy
small
-
talk
with
the
rector
'
wife
,
and
put
curate
at
their
ease
;
but
it
require
the
strong
hand
of
the
archdeacon
to
deal
with
such
as
be
refractory
either
in
their
doctrine
or
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
and
Mr
Harding
love
each
other
warmly
.
<EOS>
They
have
grow
old
together
,
and
have
together
spend
many
,
many
year
in
clerical
pursuit
and
clerical
conversation
.
<EOS>
when
one
of
them
be
a
bishop
and
the
other
only
a
minor
canon
<EOS>
they
be
even
then
much
together
;
but
since
their
child
have
marry
,
and
Mr
Harding
have
become
warden
and
precentor
,
they
be
all
in
all
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
they
manage
the
diocese
between
them
,
but
they
spend
much
time
in
discuss
the
man
who
do
,
and
in
form
little
plan
to
mitigate
his
wrath
against
church
delinquent
,
and
soften
his
aspiration
for
church
dominion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
determine
to
open
his
mind
and
confess
his
doubt
to
his
old
friend
;
and
to
him
he
go
on
the
morning
after
John
Bold
's
uncourteous
visit
.
  
<EOS>
up
to
this
period
no
rumour
of
these
cruel
proceeding
against
the
hospital
have
reach
the
bishop
's
ear
.
<EOS>
He
have
doubtless
hear
that
man
exist
who
question
his
right
to
present
to
a
sinecure
of
£
800
a
year
,
as
he
have
hear
from
time
to
time
of
some
special
immorality
or
disgraceful
disturbance
in
the
usually
decent
and
quiet
city
of
Barchester
:
but
all
he
do
,
and
all
he
be
call
on
to
do
,
on
such
occasion
,
be
to
shake
his
head
,
and
to
beg
his
son
,
the
great
dictator
,
to
see
that
no
harm
happen
to
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
story
that
Mr
Harding
have
to
tell
before
he
make
the
bishop
comprehend
his
own
view
of
the
case
;
but
we
need
not
follow
him
through
the
tale
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
bishop
counsel
but
one
step
,
recommend
but
one
remedy
,
have
but
one
medicine
in
his
whole
pharmacopoeia
strong
enough
to
touch
so
grave
a
disorder
;
 
<EOS>
he
prescribe
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
refer
him
to
the
archdeacon
,
"
he
repeat
,
as
Mr
Harding
speak
of
Bold
and
his
visit
.
"
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
will
set
you
quite
right
about
that
,
"
he
kindly
say
,
when
his
friend
speak
with
hesitation
of
the
justness
of
his
cause
.
<EOS>
"
no
man
have
get
up
all
that
so
well
as
the
archdeacon
;
"
but
the
dose
,
though
large
,
fail
to
quiet
the
patient
;
indeed
it
almost
produce
nausea
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
bishop
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
you
ever
read
John
Hiram
's
will
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
think
probably
he
have
,
thirty
-
five
year
ago
,
when
first
institute
to
his
see
,
but
could
not
state
positively
:
however
,
he
very
well
know
that
he
have
the
absolute
right
to
present
to
the
wardenship
,
and
that
the
income
of
the
warden
have
be
regularly
settle
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
bishop
,
the
question
be
,
who
have
the
power
to
settle
it
?
<EOS>
if
,
as
this
young
man
say
,
the
will
provide
that
the
proceed
of
the
property
be
to
be
divide
into
share
,
who
have
the
power
to
alter
these
provision
?
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
have
an
indistinct
idea
that
they
alter
themselves
by
the
lapse
of
year
;
that
a
kind
of
ecclesiastical
statute
of
limitation
bar
the
right
of
the
twelve
bedesman
to
any
increase
of
income
arise
from
the
increase
value
of
property
.
<EOS>
He
say
something
about
tradition
;
more
of
the
many
learn
man
who
by
their
practice
have
confirm
the
present
arrangement
;
then
go
at
some
length
into
the
propriety
of
maintain
the
due
difference
in
rank
and
income
between
a
benefice
clergyman
and
certain
poor
old
man
who
be
dependent
on
charity
;
and
conclude
his
argument
by
another
reference
to
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
the
precentor
sit
thoughtfully
gaze
at
the
fire
,
and
listen
to
the
good
-
natured
reasoning
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
what
the
bishop
say
have
a
sort
of
comfort
in
it
,
but
it
be
not
a
sustain
comfort
.
<EOS>
It
make
Mr
Harding
feel
that
many
other
,
 
indeed
,
all
other
of
his
own
order
,
 
would
think
him
right
;
but
it
fail
to
prove
to
him
that
he
truly
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bishop
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
both
have
sit
silent
for
a
while
,
"
I
should
deceive
you
and
myself
too
,
if
I
do
not
tell
you
that
I
be
very
unhappy
about
this
.
<EOS>
suppose
that
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
agree
with
Dr
Grantly
!
 
<EOS>
that
I
find
,
after
inquiry
,
that
the
young
man
be
right
,
and
that
I
be
wrong
,
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
old
man
be
sit
near
each
other
,
 
so
near
that
the
bishop
be
able
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
other
's
knee
,
and
he
do
so
with
a
gentle
pressure
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
well
know
what
that
pressure
mean
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
no
further
argument
to
adduce
;
he
could
not
fight
for
the
cause
as
his
son
would
do
;
he
could
not
prove
all
the
precentor
's
doubt
to
be
groundless
;
but
he
could
sympathise
with
his
friend
,
and
he
do
so
;
and
Mr
Harding
feel
that
he
have
receive
that
for
which
he
come
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
period
of
silence
,
after
which
the
bishop
ask
,
with
a
degree
of
irritable
energy
,
very
unusual
with
him
,
whether
this
"
pestilent
intruder
"
(
mean
John
Bold
)
have
any
friend
in
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
have
fully
make
up
his
mind
to
tell
the
bishop
everything
;
to
speak
of
his
daughter
's
love
,
as
well
as
his
own
trouble
;
to
talk
of
John
Bold
in
his
double
capacity
of
future
son
-
in
-
law
and
present
enemy
;
and
though
he
feel
it
to
be
sufficiently
disagreeable
,
now
be
his
time
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
intimate
at
my
own
house
,
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
stare
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
far
go
in
orthodoxy
and
church
militancy
as
his
son
,
but
still
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
understand
how
so
declare
an
enemy
of
the
establishment
could
be
admit
on
term
of
intimacy
into
the
house
,
not
only
of
so
firm
a
pillar
as
Mr
Harding
,
but
one
so
much
injure
as
the
warden
of
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
like
Mr
Bold
much
,
personally
,
"
continue
the
disinterested
victim
;
"
and
to
tell
you
the
"
truth
,
"
"
 
he
hesitate
as
he
bring
out
the
dreadful
tiding
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
think
it
not
improbable
that
he
would
be
my
second
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
do
not
whistle
:
we
believe
that
they
lose
the
power
of
do
so
on
be
consecrate
;
and
that
in
these
day
one
may
as
easily
meet
a
corrupt
judge
as
a
whistle
bishop
;

he
look
as
though
he
would
have
do
so
,
but
for
his
apron
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
brother
-
in
-
law
for
the
archdeacon
!
<EOS>
what
an
alliance
for
Barchester
close
!
<EOS>
what
a
connection
for
even
the
episcopal
palace
!
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
in
his
simple
mind
,
feel
no
doubt
that
John
Bold
,
have
he
so
much
power
,
would
shut
up
all
cathedral
,
and
probably
all
parish
church
;
distribute
all
tithe
among
Methodists
,
Baptists
,
and
other
savage
tribe
;
utterly
annihilate
the
sacred
bench
,
and
make
shovel
hat
and
lawn
sleeve
as
illegal
as
cowl
,
sandal
,
and
sackcloth
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
nice
man
to
be
initiate
into
the
comfortable
arcana
of
ecclesiastical
snuggery
;
one
who
doubt
the
integrity
of
parson
,
and
probably
disbelieve
the
Trinity
!
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
see
what
an
effect
his
communication
have
make
,
and
almost
repent
the
openness
of
his
disclosure
;
he
,
however
,
do
what
he
could
to
moderate
the
grief
of
his
friend
and
patron
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
there
be
any
engagement
between
them

<EOS>
have
there
be

Eleanor
would
have
tell
me
;
I
know
her
well
enough
to
be
assure
that
she
would
have
do
so
;
but
I
see
that
they
be
fond
of
each
other
;
and
as
a
man
and
a
father
,
I
have
have
no
objection
to
urge
against
their
intimacy

"
  
"
but

Mr
Harding

say
the
bishop
,

how
be
you
to
oppose
him

if

be
your
son

<EOS>

I
do
not

it

me

if
anything
be
to

do
in
defence
,
I
suppose
Chadwick
will
do
it

oh
,
the

will
see
to
that

be
the

never

<EOS>
Mr
Harding
remind
the
bishop
that
the
archdeacon
and
the
reformer
be
not
yet
brother
,
and
very
probably
never
would
be
;
exact
from
him
a

HIRAM

BEDESMEN
 
<EOS>
the
party
most
interested
in
the
movement
which
be
about
to
set
Barchester
by
the
ear
be
not
the
foremost
to
discuss
the
merit
of
the
question
,
as
be
often
the
case
;
but
when
the
bishop
,
the
archdeacon
,
the
warden
,
the
steward
,
and
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
be
all
busy
with
the
matter
,
each
in
his
own
way
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
Hiram
's
bedesman
themselves
be
altogether
passive
spectator
.
<EOS>
Finney
,
the
attorney
,
have
be
among
them
,
ask
sly
question
,
and
raise
immoderate
hope
,
create
a
party
hostile
to
the
warden
,
and
establish
a
corps
in
the
enemy
's
camp
,
as
he
figuratively
call
it
to
himself
.
<EOS>
poor
old
man
:
whoever
may
be
right
or
wrong
by
this
inquiry
<EOS>
,
they
at
any
rate
will
assuredly
be
only
injure
:
to
them
it
can
only
be
an
unmixed
evil
.
<EOS>
how
can
their
lot
be
improve
?
<EOS>
all
their
want
be
supply
;
every
comfort
be
administer
;
they
have
warm
house
,
good
clothe
,
plentiful
diet
,
and
rest
after
a
life
of
labour
;
and
above
all
,
that
treasure
so
inestimable
in
decline
year
,
a
true

kind
friend
to
listen
to
their
sorrow
,
watch
over

,
and
administer

<EOS>
John
Bold
sometimes
think
of
this
,
when
he
be
talk
loudly
of
the
right
of
the
bedesmen
,
whom
he
have
take
under
his
protection
;
but
he
quiet
the
suggestion
within
his
breast
with
the
high
-
sound
name
of
justice
:
"
_
Fiat
justitia
,
ruat
coelum
_
.
<EOS>
"
these
old
man
should
,
by
right
,
have
one
hundred
pound
a
year
instead
of
one
shilling
and
sixpence
a
day
,
and
the
warden
should
have
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
pound
instead
of
eight
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
what
be
unjust
must
be
wrong
;
what
be
wrong
should
be
right
;
and
if
he
decline
the
task
,
who
else
would
do
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
each
one
of
you
be
clearly
entitled
to
one
hundred
pound
a
year
by
common
law
"
:
<EOS>
such
have
be
the
important
whisper
make
by
Finney
into
the
ear
of
Abel
Handy
,
and
by
him
retail
to
his
eleven
brother
.
  
<EOS>
too
much
must
not
be
expect
from
the
flesh
and
blood
even
of
John
Hiram
's
bedesman
,
and
the
positive
promise
of
one
hundred
a
year
to
each
of
the
twelve
old
man
have
its
way
with
most
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
great
Bunce
be
not
to
be
wile
away
,
and
be
uphold
in
his
orthodoxy
by
two
adherent
.
<EOS>
Abel
Handy
,
who
be
the
leader
of
the
aspirant
after
wealth
,
have
,
alas
,
a
strong
following
.
<EOS>
no
less
than
five
of
the
twelve
soon
believe
that
his
view
be
just
,
make
with
their
leader
a
moiety
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
the
other
three
,
volatile
unstable
mind
,
vacillate
between
the
two
chieftain
,
now
lead
away
by
the
hope
of
gold
,
now
anxious
to
propitiate
the
power
that
still
exist
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
propose
to
address
a
petition
to
the
bishop
as
visitor
,
pray
his
lordship
to
see
justice
do
to
the
legal
recipient
of
John
Hiram
's
Charity
,
and
to
send
copy
of
this
petition
and
of
the
reply
it
would
elicit
to
all
the
lead
London
paper
,
and
thereby
to
obtain
notoriety
for
the
subject
.
<EOS>
this
it
be
think
would
pave
the
way
for
ulterior
legal
proceeding
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
great
thing
to
have
have
the
signature
and
mark
of
all
the
twelve
injure
legatee
;
but
this
be
impossible
:
bunce
would
have
cut
his
hand
off
sooner
than
have
sign
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
suggest
by
Finney
that
if
even
eleven
could
be
induce
to
sanction
the
document
,
the
one
obstinate
recusant
may
have
be
represent
as
unfit
to
judge
on
such
a
question
,
 
in
fact
,
as
be
_
non
compos
mentis
_
,
 
and
the
petition
would
have
be
take
as
represent
the
feeling
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
but
this
could
not
be
do
:
bunce
's
friend
be
as
firm
as
himself
,
and
as
yet
only
six
crosse
adorn
the
document
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
more
provoking
,
as
Bunce
himself
could
write
his
name
legibly
,
and
one
of
those
three
doubt
soul
have
for
year
boast
of
like
power
,
and
possess
,
indeed
,
a
Bible
,
in
which
he
be
proud
to
show
his
name
write
by
himself
some
thirty
year
ago
 
"
Job
Skulpit
;
"
but
it
be
think
that
Job
Skulpit
,
have
forget
his
scholarship
,
on
that
account
recoil
from
the
petition
,
and
that
the
other
doubter
would
follow
as
he
lead
them
.
<EOS>
a
petition
sign
by
half
the
hospital
would
have
but
a
poor
effect
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
Skulpit
's
room
that
the
petition
be
now
lie
,
wait
such
additional
signature
as
Abel
Handy
,
by
his
eloquence
,
could
obtain
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
six
mark
it
bear
be
duly
attest
,
thus
:
  
<EOS>
his
his
his

for
those

who
be
now

join
:
for
Skulpit
alone
be
leave
a
spot
on
which
his
genuine
signature
may
be
write
in
fair
clerk
-
like
style
.
<EOS>
Handy
have
bring
in
the
document
,
and
spread
it
out
on
the
small
deal
table
,
and
be
now
stand
by
it
persuasive
and
eager
.
<EOS>
Moody
have
follow
with
an
inkhorn
,
carefully
leave
behind
by
Finney
;
and
Spriggs
bear
aloft
,
as
though
it
be
a
sword
,
a
well
-
wear
ink
-
black
pen
,
which
from
time
to

he
endeavour

unwilling

<EOS>
with
the
learned
man
be
his
two
abettor
in
indecision
,
William
Gazy
and
Jonathan
Crumple

<EOS>
if
ever
the
petition
be
to
be
forward
,
now
be
the
time
,
 
so
say
Mr
Finney
;
and
great
be
the
anxiety
on
the
part
of
those
whose
one
hundred
pound
a

,
as
they
believe
,
mainly
depend
on
the
document
in

<EOS>
"

as
the
avaricious
Moody
have
mutter
to
his

"
by
an
old
fool

Handy
,

to
impart
to
his

sour

ill

visage
a
smile
of
approbation
,
in
which
he
greatly
fail

Mr

say
;
here
be
the
place

d'ye

he
put
his
huge
brown
finger
down
on
the
dirty
paper

it
be
all

we
be

to

say
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
We

none

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
these
miscreant
name
our
excellent
friend
.
<EOS>
the
nickname
he
could
easily
have
forgive
,
but
the
allusion
to
the
divine
source
of
all
his
melodious
joy
would
have
irritate
even
him
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
he
never
know
the
insult
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
think
,
old
Billy
Gazy
,
"
say
Spriggs
,
who
rejoice
in
great
youth
than
his
brother
,
but
have
fall
into
a
fire
when
drunk
,
have
have
one
eye
burn
out
,
one
cheek
burn
through

and
one
arm
nearly
burn
off

who

therefore
,
in

to
personal
appearance
,
be
not
the
most
prepossessing

old
Billy

he
give
a
hideous
grin
that
show
off
his
misfortune
to
their
full
extent
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Billy
Gazy
be
not
alive
to
much
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
even
these
golden
prospect
do
not
arouse
him
to
do
more
than
rub
his
poor
old
blear
eye
with
the
cuff
of
his
bedesman
's
gown
,

gently
mutter
:

continue
Spriggs
,
turn

the
other
friend
of
Skulpit

,
who
be
sit
on
a
stool
by
the
table
,
gaze
vacantly
at
the
petition

<EOS>
Jonathan
Crumple
be
a
meek
,
mild
man

who
have
know
well
day

his
mean

be
waste

bad
child

who
have
make
his

wretched
till
he
have
be
receive
into

of

he
have
not
long
be
a
member

<EOS>
since
that
day
he
have
know
neither
sorrow
nor
trouble
,
and
this
attempt
to
fill
him
with
new
hope
be
,
indeed
,
a
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
"
a

he
give
a
low
sigh

as
he
think
of
the
child
of
his

have
rob
him

Crumple
sigh
again

have
learn
the
impotency

visit

the

<EOS>
though
doubt
and
hesitation
disturb
the
rest
of
our
poor
warden
,
no
such
weakness
perplex
the
noble
breast
of
his
son

<EOS>
as
the
indomitable
cock
prepare
for
the
combat
sharpen
his
spur
,
shake
his
feather
,
and
erect
his
comb
,
so
do
the
archdeacon
arrange
his
weapon
for
the
come
war
,
without
misgive
and
without
fear
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
fully
confident
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
<EOS>
let
no
one
doubt
.
<EOS>
many
a
man
can
fight
his
battle
with
good
courage
,
but
with
a
doubt
conscience
.
<EOS>
such
be
not
the
case
with
Dr
grantly
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
believe
in
the
Gospel
with
more
assurance
than
he
do
in
the
sacred
justice
of
all
ecclesiastical
revenue
.
<EOS>
when
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
to
defend
the
income
of
the
present
and
future
precentor
of
Barchester
,
he
be
animate
by
as
strong
a
sense
of
a
holy
cause
,
as
that
which
give
courage
to
a
missionary
in
Africa
,
or
enable
a
sister
of
mercy
to
give
up
the
pleasure
of
the
world
for
the
ward
of

<EOS>
He
be
about
to
defend
the
holy
of
holy
from
the
touch
of
the
profane
;
to
guard
the
citadel
of
his
church
from
the
most
rampant
of
its
enemy

to
put
on
his

armour
in

of
fight
,

secure
,
if
possible
,
the
comfort
of
his
creed
for
come
generation

ecclesiastical
dignitary
.
<EOS>
such
a
work
require
no
ordinary
vigour
;
and
the
archdeacon
be
,
therefore
,
extraordinarily
vigorous
.
<EOS>
It
demand
a
buoyant
courage
,

a
heart
happy
in
its
toil

the
archdeacon
's
heart
be
happy
,

his

be
buoyant

<EOS>
He
know
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
animate
his
father
-
in

law
with
feeling
like
his
own
,
but
this
do
not
much
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
He
prefer
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
battle
alone
,

do
not
doubt
that
the

would
resign
himself
into
his

with
passive
submission

<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr
Chadwick
,
"
he
say
,
walk
into
the
steward

office
a
day
or
two
after
the
signing
of
the
petition
as
commemorate
in
the
last
chapter
:
"
anything
from
Cox
and
Cummins
this
morning
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
hand
him
a
letter
;
which
he
read
,
stroke
the
tight
-
gaitered
calf
of
his
right
leg
as
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
merely
say
that
they
have
as
yet
receive
no
notice
from
their
adversary
;
that
they
could
recommend
no
preliminary
step
;
but
that
should
any
proceeding
really
be
take
by
the
bedesman
,
it
would
be
expedient
to
consult
that
very
eminent
Queen
's
Counsel
,
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
them
,
"
say
Dr
grantly

refolde
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
agree
with
them

<EOS>
Haphazard

no
doubt
the
good
man

a
thorough
churchman

a
sound
conservative

in
every
respect
the
good

we

too

which
be
a
great
thing

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
quite
agree
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
how
completely
he
put
down
that
scoundrel
Horseman
about
the
Bishop
of
Beverley
's
income
;
how
completely
he
set
them
all
adrift
in
the
earl

case

<EOS>
how
he
silence
that
fellow
at
Rochester
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
must
have
Haphazard
;
and
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Mr
Chadwick
,
we
must
take
care
to
be
in
time
,
or
the
other
party
will
forestall
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
all
his
admiration
for
Sir
Abraham
,
the
doctor
seem
to
think
it
not
impossible
that
that
great
man
may
be
induce
to
lend
his
gigantic
power
to
the
side
of
the
church
's
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
have
settle
this
point
to
his
satisfaction
,
the
doctor
step
down
to
the
hospital
,
to
learn
how
matter
be
go
on
there
;
and
as
he
walk
across
the
hallowed
close
,
and
look
up
at
the
raven
who
caw
with
a
peculiar
reverence
as
he
wend
his
way
,
he
think
with
increase
acerbity
of
those
whose
impiety
would
venture
to
disturb
the
goodly
grace
of
cathedral
institution
.
  
<EOS>
and
who
have
not
feel
the
same
?
<EOS>
We
believe
that
Mr
Horseman
himself
would
relent
,
and
the
spirit
of
Sir
Benjamin
Hall
give
way
,
be
those
great
reformer
to
allow
themselves
to
stroll
by
<EOS>
moonlight
round
the
tower
of
some
of
our
ancient
church
.
<EOS>
who
would
not
feel
charity
for
a
prebendary
when
walk
the
quiet
length
of
that
long
aisle
at
Winchester
,
look
at
those
decent
house
,
that
trim
grass
-
plat
,
and
feeling
,
as
one
must
,
<EOS>
the
solemn
,
orderly
comfort
of
the
spot
!
<EOS>
who
could
be
hard
upon
a
dean
while
wander
round
the
sweet
close
of
Hereford
,
and
own
that
in
that
precinct
,
tone
and
colour
,
design
and
form
,
solemn
tower
and
storied
window
,
be
all
in
unison

and
all
perfect

<EOS>
who
could
lie
basking
in
the
cloister
of
Salisbury
,
and
gaze
on
Jewel
's
library
and
that
unequalled
spire
,
without
feel
that
bishop
should
sometimes
be
rich

<EOS>
the
tone
of
our
archdeacon
's
mind
must
not
astonish
us
;
it
have
be
the
growth
of
century
of
church
ascendancy
;
and
though
some
fungi
now
disfigure
the
tree
,
though
there
be
much
dead
wood
,
for
how
much
good
fruit
have
not
we
to
be
thankful

<EOS>
who

without

can
batter
down

dead
branch

now
useless

ah

<EOS>
still
so
beautiful

peremptory

so
harsh

<EOS>
the
archdeacon

with
all

be
not

of
delicate
feeling

and
after

make
his
morning
salutation

Bold

nothing

you

Mr

own

somewhat
unwillingly

that

have
hear
of
it

"
well

<EOS>
the
archdeacon
look
for
some
expression
of
opinion

none
come

he
continue
,
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
do
something
,
you
know

we
must
not
allow
these
people
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
us

sit
look
on

"
<EOS>
the
archdeacon

who
be
a
practical
man

allow
himself
the
use
of
everyday
expressive
mode
of
speech
when
among
his
close
intimate
,
though
no
one
could
soar
into
a
more
intricate
labyrinth
of
refined
phraseology
when
the
church
be
the
subject

his
low
brother
be
his
auditor

<EOS>
the
warden
still
look
mutely
in
his
face
,
make
the
slight
possible
pass
with
an
imaginary
fiddle
bow
,
and
stop
,
as
he
do
so
,
sundry
imaginary
string
with
the
finger
of
his
other
hand

"
Twas
his
constant
consolation
in
conversational
trouble
.
<EOS>
while
these
vex
him
sorely
,
the
pass
would
be
short
and
slow
,
and
the
upper
hand
would
not
be
see
to
work
;
nay
,
the
string
on
which
it
operate
would
sometimes
lie
conceal
in
the
musician
's
pocket
,
and
the
instrument
on
which
he
play
would
be
beneath
his
chair
;
 
but
as
his
spirit
warm
to
the
subject
,
 
as
his
trust
heart
look
to
the
bottom
of
that
which
vex
him
,
would
see
its
clear
way
out
,
 
he
would
rise
to
a
high
melody
,
sweep
the
unseen
string
with
a
bold
hand
,
and
swiftly
finger
the
cord
from
his
neck
,
down
along
his
waistcoat
,
and
up
again
to
his
very
ear
,
create
an
ecstatic
strain
of
perfect
music

audible
to
himself

to
St
Cecilia
,

not
without
effect

nothing

could
be
more
private

those

faint
appetite

still
his
dull
eye
have
glisten
for
a
moment
at
the
idea
of
possess
a
hundred
pound
a

to
his

"
as
Abel
Handy
have
eloquently
express
it
;

poor
old
Johnny
Bell
have
greedily
put
his
mark
to
the
petition

when
the
two
clergyman
appear
,
they
all
uncover
their
head

<EOS>
Handy
be
slow

do
it

hesitate

the
black
coat

so
irreverently
in
Skulpit

have
its
effect

he
look

place
there

militant
here

his

large

new

and
well

pronounce

a
churchman

declare
the

do
the
Quaker

broad
brim

his
heavy

large
open

the
broad

amply
cover

fine

tell
how
well

one

ensconce

evince
the
practical

You

quite
finish

but
he
feel
that
he
could
not
recommence
with
dignity
after
this
little
ebullition

and
he
lead
the
way
back
into
the
garden

by
his
father

as
soon

he

"
yes

you
be
plain
enough

the

in

tone

do
not

now
I
will
just
step
into
Chadwick

,

tell
him
what
I
have
do

then
I
will
go
up
to
the
palace

answer
this
petition

"
  
<EOS>
the
warden
's
mind
be
very
full
,
 
full
nearly
to
overcharge
itself
;
and
have
it
do
so
,
 
have
he
allow
himself
to
speak
the
thought
which
be
work
within
him
,
he
would
indeed
have
astonish
the
archdeacon
by
the
reprobation
he
would
have
express
as
to
the
proceeding
of
which
he
have
be
so
unwilling
a
witness
.
<EOS>
but
different
feeling
keep
him
silent
;
he
be
as
yet
afraid
of
differ
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
;
 
he
be
anxious
beyond
measure
to
avoid
even
a
semblance
of
rupture
with
any
of
his
order
,
and
be
painfully
fearful
of
have
to
come
to
an
open
quarrel
with
any
person
on
any
subject
.
<EOS>
His
life
have
hitherto
be
so
quiet
,
so
free
from
strife
;
his
little
early
trouble
have
require
nothing
but
passive
fortitude
;
his
subsequent
prosperity
have
never
force
upon
him
any
active
care
,
 
have
never
bring
him
into
disagreeable
contact
with
anyone
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
would
give
almost
anything
,
 
much
more
than
he
know
he
ought
to
do
,
 
to
relieve
himself
from
the
storm
which
he
fear
be
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
hard
that
the
pleasant
water
of
his
little
stream
should
be
disturb
and
muddy
by
rough
hand
;
that
his
quiet
path
should
be
make
a
battlefield
;
that
the
unobtrusive
corner
of
the
world
which
have
be
allot
to
him
,
as
though
by
Providence
,
should
be
invade
and
desecrate
,
and
all
within
it
make
miserable
and
unsound
.
  
<EOS>
money
he
have
none
to
give
;
the
knack
of
put
guinea
together
have
never
belong
to
him
;
but
how
willingly
,
with
what
a
foolish
easiness
,
with
what
happy
alacrity
,
would
he
have
abandon
the
half
of
his
income
for
all
time
to
come
,
<EOS>
could
he
by
so
do
<EOS>
have
quietly
dispel
the
cloud
that
be
gather
over
him
,
 
could
he
have
thus
compromise
the
matter
between
the
reformer
and
the
conservative
,
between
his
possible
son
-
in
-
law
,
Bold
,
and
his
positive
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
compromise
would
not
have
be
make
from
any
prudential
motive
of
save
what
would
yet
remain
,
for
Mr
Harding
still
feel
little
doubt
but
he
should
be
leave
for
life
in
quiet
possession
of
the
good
thing
he
have
,
if
he
choose
to
retain
them
.
<EOS>
no
;
he
would
have
do
so
from
the
sheer
love
of
quiet
,
and
from
a
horror
of
be
make
the
subject
of
public
talk
.
<EOS>
He
have
very
often
be
move
to
pity
.
 
<EOS>
to
that
inward
weeping
of
the
heart
for
other
'
woe
;
<EOS>
but
none
have
he
ever
pity
more
than
that
old
lord
,
whose
almost
fabulous
wealth
,
draw
from
his
church
preferment
,
have
become
the
subject
of
so
much
opprobrium
,
of
such
public
scorn
;
that
wretched
clerical
octogenarian
Croesus
,
whom
man
would
not
allow
to
die
in
peace
,
 
whom
all
the
world
unite
to
decry
and
to
abhor
.
  
<EOS>
be
he
to
suffer
such
a
fate
?
<EOS>
be
his
humble
name
to
be
bandy
in
man
's
mouth
,
as
the
gormandiser
of
the
resource
of
the
poor
,
as
of
one
who
have
filch
from
the
charity
of
other
age
wealth
which
have
be
intend
to
relieve
the
old
and
the
infirm
?
<EOS>
be
he
to
be
gibbet
in
the
press
,
to
become
a
byword
for
oppression
,
to
be
name
as
an
example
of
the
greed
of
the
english
church
?
<EOS>
Should
it
ever
be
say
that
he
have
rob
those
old
man
,
whom
he
so
truly
and
so
tenderly
love
in
his
heart
of
heart
?

as
he
slowly
pace
,
hour
after
hour
,
under
those
noble
lime

tree
,
turn
these
sad
thought
within
him
,
he
become
all

fix
in
his
resolve
that
some
great
step
must
be
take
to
relieve
him
from
the
risk
of
so
terrible
a
fate

in
the
meanwhile

the

with
contented

unruffled
spirit

go
about
his
business

say
a
word
or
two
to
Mr
Chadwick

and
then
find
,
as
he
expect
,
the
petition
lie
in
his
father
's
library
,
he
write
a
short
answer
to
the
man
,
in
which
he
tell
them
that
they
have
no
evil
to
redress
,
but
rather
great
mercy
for
which
to
be
thankful
;
and
have
see
the
bishop
sign
it
,
he
get
into
his
brougham

TEA
PARTY
 
<EOS>
after
much
painful
doubting
,
on
one
thing
only
could
Mr
Harding
resolve
.
<EOS>
He
determine
that
at
any
rate
he
would
take
no
offence
,
and
that
he
would
make
this
question
no
cause
of
quarrel
either
with
Bold
or
with
the
bedesman
.
<EOS>
in
furtherance
of
this
resolution
,
he
himself
write
a
note
to
Mr
Bold
,
the
same
afternoon
,
invite
him
to
meet
a
few
friend
and
hear
some
music
on
an
evening
name
in
the
next
week

<EOS>
have
not
this
little
party
be
promise
to
Eleanor
,
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
would
probably
have
avoid
such
gaiety
;
but
the
promise
have
be
give
,
the
invitation
be
to
be
write
,
and
when
Eleanor
consult
her
father
on
the
subject
,
she
be
not
ill
pleased
to
hear
him
say
,
"
oh
,
I
be
think
of
Bold
,
so
I
take
it
into
my
head
to
write
to
him
myself

but
you
must
write
to
his

old
than
her

,
at
the
time
of
our

be
just
over
thirty

<EOS>
She
be
not
an
unattractive
young
woman
,
though
by
no
means
beautiful

<EOS>
Her
great
merit
be
the
kindliness
of
her
disposition

<EOS>
She
be
not
very
clever
,
nor
very
animated
,
nor
have
she
apparently
the
energy
of
her
brother
;
but
she
be
guide
by
a
high
principle
of
right
and
wrong
;
her
temper
be
sweet
,
and
her
fault
be
few
in
number
than
her
virtue
.
<EOS>
those
who
casually
meet
Mary
Bold
think
little
of
her
;
but
those
who
know
her
well
love
her
well

they
know
her
the
more
they
love
her

Eleanor

Her

understand
immediately
the
nature

it
be
not
so
easy
for
him
to
behave
well
in
the
matter
,
as
it
be
for
Mr

It
be

here

still

nothing

He

at

steadily

devotion

the

off

there

fat
old

gauzy
muslin
frock

old

up

empty
fire

look
by
no

so
comfortable

do
in

rather
stiff
about
the
neck

cluster
near

not

sufficiently
in
courage
to
attack
the
muslin
frock

who
await
the
battle
,
draw
up
in
a
semicircular
array
.
<EOS>
the
warden
endeavour
to
induce
a
charge
,
but
fail
signally
,
not
have
the
tact
of
a
general

his

do
what
she
could
to
comfort
the
force
under
her
command

who
take
in
refreshing
ration
of
cake

tea
,
and
patiently
look
for
the
come
engagement

but
she
herself
,
Eleanor

have
no
spirit

work
;
the
only
enemy
whose
lance
she
care
to
encounter
be
not
there
,
and
she
and
other
be
somewhat
dull
.
  
<EOS>
loud
above
all
voice
be
hear
the
clear
sonorous
tone
of
the
archdeacon
as
he
dilate
to
brother
parson
of
the
danger
of
the
church
,
of
the
fearful
rumour
of
mad
reform
even
at
Oxford

of
the
damnable
heresy
of
Dr
Whiston

sweeter

little

wax

big

how
often
be
those
peg
twist

re

twist
before
our

find
that
he
have
twist
them
enough
;
how
many
discordant
scrape
give
promise
of
the
come
harmony
.
<EOS>
how
much
the
muslin
flutter
and
crumple
before
Eleanor
and
another
nymph
be
duly
seat
at
the
piano
;
how
closely
do
that
tall
Apollo
pack
himself
against
the
wall
,
with
his
flute
,
long
as
himself
,
extend
high
over

into
how
small
a
corner
creep
that
round

florid
little
minor
canon

and
there
with
skill
amazing
find
room
to
tune
his
accustomed
fiddle

<EOS>
and
now
the
crash
begin
:
away
they
go
in
full
flow
of
harmony
together
,
 
up
hill
and
down
dale
,
 
now
louder
and
louder
,
then
low
and
lower
;
now
loud
,
as
though
stir
the
battle

then
low

as

mourn
the
slain

<EOS>
in
all

through

nothing

those

twisted

<EOS>
now
alone
that
saddest
of
instrument
tell
its
touching
tale

<EOS>
silent
,

in
awe

stand

to
hear
the
sorrow

for
a
moment

before
the
melancholy
of

again

the
full
force
of
all
the
band

down

away

twenty
finger
scour
over
the
bass
note
with
all
the
impetus
of
passion

<EOS>
apollo
blow
till
his
stiff
neckcloth

and
the
minor
canon
work
with
both

till
he
fall
in
a
syncope
of
exhaustion
against
the

<EOS>
how
come
it
that
now
,
when
all
should
be
silent
,
when
courtesy
,
if

should
make
man

<EOS>
how
be
it
at
this
moment
the
black

coated
corp
leave
their
retreat
and
begin
skirmish
?
<EOS>
one
by
one
they
creep
forth
,
and
fire
off
little
gun
timidly
,
and
without
precision
.
<EOS>
ah
,
my
man
,
effort
such
as
these
will
take
no
city
,
even
though
the
enemy
should
be
never
so
open
to
assault

at
length
a
more
deadly
artillery

bring
to
bear

slowly
,
but
with
effect
,
the
advance
be
make
;
the
muslin
rank
be
break

and
fall
into
confusion
;
the
formidable
array
of

way
;
the
battle

no

hand

with
what
anxious
nicety
do
they
arrange
their
card

jealous

why
be
that
lean
doctor
so
slow

cadaverous

with
hollow

see
how
the

speechless
in

deposit
on
the
board
his
card

and
look
to
heaven

to
the
ceiling
for
support

<EOS>
hark

how
he
sigh

as
with

in
his

pocket
he
seem
to

that
the
end

such
torment

Vain
be
the
hope

if
hope
there

to
disturb
that
meagre

with
care
precise
he
place
every
card

weigh
well
the
value
of
each
mighty
ace

each

on

count
all
his

set
his
price
upon

thrice

constant

favour
the
brace
of
prebendary

himself
to
the

at
the
fourth
assault
he

to
the

a
prostrate

low
his
crown

bushy

over
the

and
then

trump

,
then
another

then
a
king

then
an

then
a

He
dash
out
his

most
annoying

over

them
some

shove
the

when
she

young
Dickson
of
the

to
fasten
her

round
her
neck

think
that
two
hundred
pound
a
year
and
a
little

would
really
do
for
happiness

so

his

<EOS>
what
have
pass
between
Eleanor
Harding
and
Mary
Bold
nee
not

<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
matter
of
thankfulness
that
neither
the
historian
nor
the
novelist
hear
all
that
be
say
by
their
hero
or
heroine
,
or
how
would
three
volume
or
twenty
suffice
!
<EOS>
in
the
present
case
so
little
of
this
sort
have
I
overhear
,
that
I
live
in
hope
of
finish
my
work
within
300
page
,
and
of
complete
that
pleasant
task
 
a
novel
in
one
volume
;
but
something
have
pass
between
them
,
and
as
the
warden
blow
out
the
wax
candle
,
and
put
his
instrument
into
its
case
,
his
daughter
stand
sad
and
thoughtful
by
the
empty
fire
-
place
,
determine
to
speak
to
her
father
,
but
irresolute
as
to
what
she
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Eleanor

"
say
he
,
"
be
you
for
bed

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
she

move

I
suppose
so
;
but
papa
 
<EOS>
Mr

be
not
here
tonight
;
do
you
know
why
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
ask
;
I
write
to
him
myself

say
the

<EOS>

but
do
you
know
why
he
do
not
come

papa

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Eleanor

I
could
guess

it

at

she
exclaim
,
throw
her

round
him

and
look
into
his
face
;
"
what
be
it
he

what

it
all
about

"
Danger
,
my

what
sort
of
danger
?
"
  
"
danger
to
you
,
danger
of
trouble
,
and
of
loss

and
of
 
oh

papa
,
why
have
not
you
tell
me
of
all
this
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
not
the
man
to
judge
harshly
of
anyone
,
much
less
of
the
daughter
whom
he
now
love
better
than
any
live
creature
;
but
still
he
do
judge
her
wrongly
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
love
John
Bold
;
he
fully
sympathise
in
her
affection
;
day
after
day
he
think
more
of
the
matter
,
and
,
with
the
tender
care
of
a
love
father
,
try
to
arrange
in
his
own
mind
how
matter
may
be
so
manage
that
his
daughter
's
heart
should
not
be
make
the
sacrifice
to
the
dispute
which
be
likely
to
exist
between
him
and
Bold
.
<EOS>
now
,
when
she
speak
to
him
for
the
first
time
on
the
subject
,
it
be
natural
that
he
should
think
more
of
her
than
of
himself
,
and
that
he
should
imagine
that
her
own
care
,
and
not
his
,
be
trouble
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
silent
before
her
awhile
,
as
she
gaze
up
into
his
face
,
and
then
kiss
her
forehead
he
place
her
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
nelly
,
"
he
say
(
he
only
call
her
nelly
in
his
kind
,
softest
,
sweetest
mood
,
and
yet
all
his
mood
be
kind
and
sweet
)
,
"
tell
me
,
<EOS>
nelly
,
do
you
like
Mr
Bold
 
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
quite
take
aback
by
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
she
have
forget
herself
,
and
her
own
love
in
think
about
John
Bold
,
and
while
converse
with
Mary
:
she
certainly
have
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
sick
at
heart
to
think
that
a
man
of
whom
she
could
not
but
own
to
herself
that
she
love
him
,
of
whose
regard
she
have
be
so
proud
,
that
such
a
man
should
turn
against
her
father
to
ruin
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
her
vanity
hurt
,
that
his
affection
for
her
have
not
keep
him
from
such
a
course
;
have
he
really
care
for
her
,
he
would
not
have
risk
her
love
by
such
an
outrage
.
<EOS>
but
her
main
fear
have
be
for
her
father
,
and
when
she
speak
of
danger
,
it
be
of
danger
to
him
and
not
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
take
aback
by
the
question
altogether
:
"
do
I
like
him
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
nelly
,
do
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
why
should
not
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
but
that
be
a
poor
word
;
 
do
you
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sit
still
in
his
arm
without
answer
him
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
have
not
prepare
herself
for
an
avowal
of
affection
,
intending
,
as
she
have
do
,
to
abuse
John
Bold
herself
,
and
to
hear
her
father
do
so
also
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
love
,
"
say
he
,
"
let
us
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
:
do
you
tell
me
what
concern
yourself
,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
concern
me
and
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
without
wait
for
an
answer
,
he
describe
to
her
,
as
he
best
could
,
the
accusation
that
be
make
about
Hiram
's
will
;
the
claim
which
the
old
man
put
forward
;
what
he
consider
the
strength
and
what
the
weakness
of
his
own
position
;
the
course
which
Bold
have
take
,
and
that
which
he
presume
he
be
about
to
take
;
and
then
by
degree
,
without
further
question
,
he
presume
on
the
fact
of
Eleanor
's
love
,
and
speak
of
that
love
as
a
feeling
which
he
could
in
no
way
disapprove
:
he
apologise
for
Bold
,
excuse
what
he
be
do
;
nay
,
praise
him
for
his
energy
and
intention
;
make
much
of
his
good
quality
,
and
harp
on
none
of
his
foible
;
then
,
remind
his
daughter
how
late
it
be
,
and
comfort
her
with
much
assurance
which
he
hardly
feel
himself
,
he
send
her
to
her
room
,
with
flow
eye
and
a
full
heart
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Harding
meet
his
daughter
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
there
be
no
further
discussion
on
the
matter
,
nor
be
the
subject
mention
between
them
for
some
day
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
party
Mary
Bold
call
at
the
hospital
,
but
there
be
various
person
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
the
time
,
and
she
therefore
say
nothing
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
follow
,
John
Bold
meet
Miss
Harding
in
one
of
the
quiet
,
sombre
,
shaded
walk
of
the
close
.
<EOS>
He
be
most
anxious
to
see
her
,
but
unwilling
to
call
at
the
warden
's
house
,
and
have
in
truth
waylaid
her
in
her
private
haunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
tell
me
,
"
say
he
,
abruptly
hurry
on
with
his
premeditated
speech
,
"
my
sister
tell
me
that
you
have
a
delightful
party
the
other
evening

<EOS>
I
be
so
sorry
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
sorry

say
Eleanor
,
with
dignified
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Miss
Harding
,
you
understand
<EOS>
why
,
at
this
moment
 
"
and
Bold
hesitate
,
mutter
,
stop
,
commence
his
explanation
again
,
and
again
break
down
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
would
not
help
him
in
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
sister
explain
to
you
,
Miss
Harding
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
apologise
,
Mr
Bold
;
my
father
will
,
I
be
sure
,
always
be
glad
to
see
you
,
if
you
like
to
come
to
the
house
now
as
formerly
;
nothing
have
occur
to
alter
his
feeling
:
of
your
own
view
<EOS>
you
be
,
of
course
,
the
good
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
be
all
that
be
kind
and
generous
;
he
always
be
so
;
but
you
,
Miss
Harding
,
yourself
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
judge
me
harshly
,
because
 
"
  
"
Mr
Bold
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
may
be
sure
of
one
thing
<EOS>
;
I
shall
always
judge
my
father
to
be
right
,
and
those
who
oppose
him
I
shall
judge
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
if
those
who
do
not
know
him
oppose
him
,
I
shall
have
charity
enough
to
believe
that
they
be
wrong
,
through
error
of
judgment
;
but
should
I
see
him
attack
by
those
who
ought
to
know
him
,
and
to
love
him
,
and
revere
him
,
of
such
I
shall
be
constrain
to
form
a
different
opinion

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
curtsey
low
she
sail
on
,
leave
her
lover
in
anything
but
a
happy
state
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
_

the
JUPITER
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
though
Eleanor
Harding
ride
off
from
John
Bold
on
a
high
horse
,
it
must
not
be
suppose
that
her
heart
be
so
elate
as
her
demeanour
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
have
a
natural
repugnance
to
lose
her
lover
;
and
in
the
next
,
she
be
not
quite
so
sure
that
she
be
in
the
right
as
she
pretend
to
be
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
tell
her
,
and
that
now
repeatedly
,
that
Bold
be
do
nothing
unjust
or
ungenerous
;
and
why
then
should
she
rebuke
him
,
and
throw
him
off
,
when
she
feel
herself
so
ill
able
to
bear
his
loss
?
 
<EOS>
but
such
be
human
nature
,
and
young
-
lady
-
nature
especially
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
walk
off
from
him
beneath
the
shady
elm
of
the
close
,
her
look
,
her
tone
,
every
motion
and
gesture
of
her
body
,
belie
her
heart
;
she
would
have
give
the
world
to
have
take
him
by
the
hand
,
to
have
reason
with
him
,
persuade
him
,
cajole
him
,
coax
him
out
of
his
project
;
to
have
overcome
him
with
all
her
female
artillery
,
and
to
have
redeem
her
father
at
the
cost
of
herself
;
but
pride
would
not
let
her
do
this
,
and
she
leave
him
without
a
look
of
love
or
a
word
of
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
have
Bold
be
judge
of
another
lover
and
of
another
lady
,
he
may
have
understand
all
this
as
well
as
we
do
;
but
in
matter
of
love
man
do
not
see
clearly
in
their
own
affair

<EOS>
They
say
that
faint
heart
never
win
fair
lady

and
it
be
amazing
to
me
how
fair
lady
be
win
,
so
faint
be
often
man

heart

<EOS>
be
it
not
for
the
kindness
of
their
nature

that
see
the
weakness
of
our
courage
they
will
occasionally
descend
from
their
impregnable
fortress
,
and
themselves
aid
us
in
effect
their
own
defeat
,
too
often
would
they
escape
unconquere

unscathed

free
of

<EOS>
Poor
Bold
creep
off
quite
crestfallen
;
he
feel
that
as
regard
Eleanor
Harding
his
fate
be
seal
,
unless
he
could
consent
to
give
up
a
task
to
which
he
have
pledge
himself
,
and
which
indeed
it
would
not
be
easy
for
him
to
give
up
.
<EOS>
lawyer
be
engage
,
and
the
question
have
to
a
certain
extent
be
take
up
by
the

besides

how
could
a

spirited

like
Eleanor

really
learn
to

a

for
neglect
a
duty

<EOS>
Could
she
allow
her
affection
to
be
purchase
at
the
cost
of
his

respect
?
  
<EOS>
as
regard
the
issue
of
his
attempt
at
reformation
in
the
hospital
,
Bold
have
no
reason
hitherto
to
be
discontent
with
his
success

<EOS>
all
Barchester

about
it

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
Sir

powerful
organ
of

of
its

launch
at
St

thus
remark
:
"
another
case
,
of
small
dimension
indeed
,
but
of
similar
import
,
be
now
likely
to
come
under
public
notice

<EOS>
We
be
inform
that

be
in

of
twenty

five

the
sum

<EOS>
in
other
word

the
legatee
under

have
receive
no
advantage
from
the
increase
in
the

of
the

during

last
four
century

such
increase
have
be
absorb
by

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
case
of
great
injustice

<EOS>
It
be
no
answer
to
say
that
some
six

nine

twelve
old

receive

much
of

on

<EOS>
the
contentment
of
these
almsman

if
content
they

can
give

no

<EOS>
Sir

be
deeply
engage
in
prepare
a
bill
for
the
mortification
of
papist
,
to
be
call
the
"
Convent
Custody
Bill
,
"
the
purport
of
which
be
to
enable
any
protestant
clergyman
over
fifty
year
of
age
to
search
any
nun
whom
he
suspect
of
be
in
possession
of
treasonable
paper
or
jesuitical
symbol
;
and
as
there
be
to
be
a
hundred
and
thirty
-
seven
clause
in
the
bill
,
each
clause
contain
a
separate
thorn
for
the
side
of
the
papist
,
and
as
it
be
know
the
bill
would
be
fight
inch
by
inch
,
by
fifty
madden
Irishmen
,
the
due
construction
and
adequate
dovetailing
of
it
<EOS>
do
consume
much
of
Sir
Abraham
's
time
.
<EOS>
the
bill
have
all
its
desire
effect
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
never
pass
into
law
;
but
it
so
completely
divide
the
rank
of
the
irish
member
,
who
have
bind
themselves
together
to
force
on
the
ministry
a
bill
for
compel
all
man
to
drink
irish
whiskey
,
and
all
woman
to
wear
irish
poplin
,
that
for
the
remainder
of
the
session
the
Great
Poplin
and
Whiskey
League
be
utterly
harmless
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
Sir

's
opinion
be
not
at

forthcoming
,
and
the
uncertainty

the
expectation
,

the

as
it

still
early

on

we
will
not

proceed
into
a
small
inner
room
,
where
the
doctor
dress
and
keep
his
boot
and
sermon
;
and
here
we
will
take
our
stand

premise
that
the
door
of

be
so
open
as
to
admit
of

"
It

with
his

I

"
I

<EOS>
"
if
you
would
just
have
let
John
Bold
come
and
go
there
,
as
he
and
papa
like
,
he
and
Eleanor
would
have
be
marry
by

we
should
not

hear
one
word
about

this
affair

,
my

oh

it
be
all
very
well
,
archdeacon

and
of
course
you
be
right
;
I
do
not
for
a
moment
think
you
will
ever
admit
that
you
could
be
wrong
;
but
the
fact
be
,
you
have
bring
this
young

down
upon

him

you
have
do

all

ever
to

<EOS>
Papa
have
not

a

and
though
Eleanor
be
well
enough
,
she
have
not
at
all
a
take
style

beauty

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
how
she
be

do
well

marry
John

as
well
indeed

add
the
anxious

give
the

her
last
shoe

<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
feel
keenly
the
injustice
of
this
attack
;
but
what
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
huff
John
Bold
;
he
certainly
have
object
to
him
as
a
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
a
very
few
month
ago
the
very
idea
have
excite
his
wrath
:
but
now
matter
be
change
;
John
Bold
have
show
his
power
,
and
,
though
he
be
as
odious
as
ever
to
the
archdeacon
,
power
be
always
respect
,
and
the
reverend
dignitary
begin
to
think
that
such
an
alliance
may
not
have
be
imprudent
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
his
motto
be
still
"
no
surrender
;
"
he
would
still
fight
it
out
;
he
believe
confidently
in
Oxford
,
in
the
bench
of
bishop
,
in
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
,
and
in
himself
;
and
it
be
only
when
alone
with
his
wife
that
doubt
of
defeat
ever
beset
him
.
<EOS>
He
once
more
try
to
communicate
this
confidence
to
Mrs
Grantly
,
and
for
the
twentieth
time
begin
to
tell
her
of
Sir
Abraham
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Sir
Abraham
!
"
say
she
,
collect
all
her
house
key
into
her
basket
before
she
descend
;
"
Sir
Abraham
will
not
get
Eleanor
a
husband
;
Sir
Abraham
will
not
get
papa
another
income
when
he
have
be
worrete
out
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Mark
what
I
tell
you
,
<EOS>
archdeacon
:
while
you
and
Sir
Abraham
be
fight
,
papa
will
lose
his
preferment
;
and
what
will
you
do
then
with
him
and
Eleanor
on
your
hand
?
<EOS>
besides
,
who
be
to
pay
Sir
Abraham
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
will
not
take
the
case
up
for
nothing
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
the
lady
descend
to
family
worship
among
her
child
and
servant
,
the
pattern
of
a
good

prudent
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
grantly
be
bless
with
a
happy
,
thrive
family
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
first
,
three
boy
,
now
at
home
from
school
for
the
holiday
.
<EOS>
They
be
call
,
respectively
,
Charles
James
,
Henry
,
and
Samuel
.
<EOS>
the
two
young
(
there
be
five
in
all
)
be
girl
;
the
elder
,
Florinda
,
bear
the
name
of
the
Archbishop
of
York
's
wife
,
whose
godchild
she
be
:
and
the
young
have
be
christen
Grizzel
,
after
a
sister
of
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
the
boy
be
all
clever
,
and
give
good
promise
of
be
well
able
to
meet
the
care
and
trial
of
the
world
;
and
yet
they
be
not
alike
in
their
disposition
,
and
each
have
his
individual
character
,
and
each
his
separate
admirer
among
the
doctor
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
James
be
an
exact
and
careful
boy
;
he
never
commit
himself
;
he
well
know
how
much
be
expect
from
the
eld
son
of
the
Archdeacon
of
Barchester
,
and
be
therefore
mindful
not
to
mix
too
freely
with
other
boy
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
great
talent
of
his
young
brother
,
but
he
exceed
them
in
judgment
and
propriety
of
demeanour
;
his
fault
,
if
he
have
one
,
be
an
over
-
attention
to
word
instead
of
thing
;
there
be
a
thought
too
much
finesse
about
him
,
and
,
as
even
his
father
sometimes
tell
him
,
he
be
too
fond
of
a
compromise
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
be
the
archdeacon
's
favourite
son
,
and
Henry
be
indeed
a
brilliant
boy
.
<EOS>
the
versatility
of
his
genius
be
surprising
,
and
the
visitor
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
be
often
amazed
at
the
marvellous
manner
in
which
he
would
,
when
call
on
,
adapt
his
capacity
to
apparently
most
uncongenial
pursuit
.
<EOS>
He
appear
once
before
a
large
circle
as
Luther
the
reformer
,
and
delight
them
with
the
perfect
manner
in
which
he
assume
the
character
;
and
within
three
day
he
again
astonish
them
by
act
the
part
of
a
Capuchin
friar
to
the
very
life
.
<EOS>
for
this
last
exploit
his
father
give
him
a
golden
guinea
,
and
his
brother
say
the
reward
have
be
promise
beforehand
in
the
event
of
the
performance
be
successful
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
send
on
a
tour
into
Devonshire
;
a
treat
which
the
lad
be
most
anxious
of
enjoy
.
<EOS>
His
father
's
friend
there
,
however
,
do
not
appreciate
his
talent
,
and
sad
account
be
send
home
of
the
perversity
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
most
courageous
lad
,
game
to
the
backbone
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
soon
know
,
both
at
home
,
where
he
live
,
and
within
some
mile
of
Barchester
Cathedral
,
and
also
at
Westminster
,
where
he
be
at
school
,
that
young
Henry
could
box
well
and
would
never
own
himself
beat
;
other
boy
would
fight
while
they
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
,
but
he
would
fight
with
no
leg
at
all
.
<EOS>
those
back
him
would
sometimes
think
him
crush
by
the
weight
of
blow
and
faint
with
loss
of
blood
,
and
his
friend
would
endeavour
to
withdraw
him
from
the
contest
;
but
no
,
Henry
never
give
in
,
be
never
weary
of
the
battle
.
<EOS>
the
ring
be
the
only
element
in
which
he
seem
to
enjoy
himself
;
and
while
other
boy
be
happy
in
the
number
of
their
friend
,
he
rejoice
most
in
the
multitude
of
his
foe
.
  
<EOS>
His
relation
could
not
but
admire
his
pluck
,
but
they
sometimes
be
force
to
regret
that
he
be
incline
to
be
a
bully
;
and
those
not
so
partial
to
him
as
his
father
be
,
observe
with
pain
that
,
though
he
could
fawn
to
the
master
and
the
archdeacon
's
friend
,
he
be
imperious
and
masterful
to
the
servant
and
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
but
perhaps
Samuel
be
the
general
favourite
;
and
dear
little
Soapy
,
as
he
be
familiarly
call
,
be
as
engage
a
child
as
ever
fond
mother
pet
.
<EOS>
He
be
soft
and
gentle
in
his
manner
,
and
attractive
in
his
speech
;
the
tone
of
his
voice
be
melody
,
and
every
action
be
a
grace
;
unlike
his
brother
,
he
be
courteous
to
all
<EOS>
,
he
be
affable
to
the
lowly
,
and
meek
even
to
the
very
scullery
-
maid
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
boy
of
great
promise
,
mind
his
book
and
delight
the
heart
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
His
brother
,
however
,
be
not
particularly
fond
of
him
;
they
would
complain
to
their
mother
that
Soapy
's
civility
all
mean
something
;
they
think
that
his
voice
be
too
often
listen
to
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
evidently
fear
that
,
as
he
grow
up
,
he
would
have
more
weight
in
the
house
than
either
of
them
;
there
be
,
therefore
,
a
sort
of
agreement
among
them
to
put
young
Soapy
down
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
so
easy
to
be
do
;
Samuel
,
though
young
,
be
sharp
;
he
could
not
assume
the
stiff
decorum
of
Charles
James
,
nor
could
he
fight
like
Henry
;
but
he
be
a
perfect
master
of
his
own
weapon
,
and
contrive
,
in
the
tooth
of
both
of
them
,
to
hold
the
place
which
he
have
assume
.
<EOS>
Henry
declare
that
he
be
a
false
,
cunne
creature
;
and
Charles
James
,
though
he
always
speak
of
him
as
his
dear
brother
Samuel
,
be
not
slow
to
say
a
word
against
him
when
opportunity
offer
.
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
,
Samuel
be
a
cunning
boy
,
and
those
even
who
love
him
best
could
not
but
own
that
for
one
so
young
,
he
be
too
adroit
in
choose
his
word
,
and
too
skilled
in
modulate
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
little
girl
Florinda
and
Grizzel
be
nice
little
girl
enough
,
but
they
do
not
possess
the
strong
sterling
quality
of
their
brother
;
their
voice
be
not
often
hear
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
they
be
bashful
and
timid
by
nature
,
slow
to
speak
before
company
even
when
ask
to
do
so
;
and
though
they
look
very
nice
in
their
clean
white
muslin
frock
and
pink
sash
,
they
be
but
little
notice
by
the
archdeacon
's
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
of
submissive
humility
may
have
appear
in
the
gait
and
visage
of
the
archdeacon
during
his
colloquy
with
his
wife
in
the
sanctum
of
their
dressing
-
room
be
dispel
as
he
enter
his
breakfast
-
parlour
with
erect
head
and
powerful
step
.
<EOS>
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
he
assume
the
lord
and
master
;
and
that
wise
and
talented
lady
too
well
know
the
man
to
whom
her
lot
for
life
be
bind
,
to
stretch
her
authority
beyond
the
point
at
which
it
would
be
bear
.
<EOS>
stranger
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
when
they
see
the
imperious
brow
with
which
he
command
silence
from
the
large
circle
of
visitor
,
child
,
and
servant
who
come
together
in
the
morning
to
hear
him
read
the
word
of
God
,
and
watch
how
meekly
that
wife
seat
herself
behind
her
basket
of
key
with
a
little
girl
on
each
side
,
as
she
catch
that
command
glance
;
stranger
,
I
say
,
see
this
,
could
little
guess
that
some
fifteen
minute
since
she
have
stoutly
hold
her
ground
against
him
,
hardly
allow
him
to
open
his
mouth
in
his
own
defence
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
the
tact
and
talent
of
woman
!
  
<EOS>
and
now
let
us
observe
the
well
-
furnish
breakfast
-
parlour
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
the
comfortable
air
of
all
the
belonging
of
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
comfortable
they
certainly
be
,
but
neither
gorgeous
nor
even
grand
;
indeed
,
consider
the
money
that
have
be
spend
there
,
the
eye
and
taste
may
have
be
better
serve
;
there
be
an
air
of
heaviness
about
the
room
which
may
have
be
avoid
without
any
sacrifice
of
propriety
;
colour
may
have
be
better
choose
and
light
more
perfectly
diffuse
;
but
perhaps
in
do
so
the
thorough
clerical
aspect
of
the
whole
may
have
be
somewhat
mar
;
at
any
rate
,
it
be
not
without
ample
consideration
that
those
thick
,
dark
,
costly
carpet
be
put
down
;
those
emboss
,
but
sombre
paper
hang
up
;
those
heavy
curtain
drape
so
as
to
half
exclude
the
light
of
the
sun
:
nor
be
these
old
-
fashioned
chair
,
buy
at
a
price
far
exceed
that
now
give
for
more
modern
good
,
without
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
breakfast
-
service
on
the
table
be
equally
costly
and
equally
plain
;
the
apparent
object
have
be
to
spend
money
without
obtain
brilliancy
or
splendour
.
<EOS>
the
urn
be
of
thick
and
solid
silver
,
as
be
also
the
tea
-
pot
,
coffee
-
pot
,
cream
-
ewer
,
and
sugar
-
bowl
;
the
cup
be
old
,
dim
dragon
china
,
worth
about
a
pound
a
piece
,
but
very
despicable
in
the
eye
of
the
uninitiated
.
<EOS>
the
silver
fork
be
so
heavy
as
to
be
disagreeable
to
the
hand
,
and
the
bread
-
basket
be
of
a
weight
really
formidable
to
any
but
robust
person
.
<EOS>
the
tea
consume
be
the
very
good
,
the
coffee
the
very
black
,
the
cream
<EOS>
the
very
thick
;
there
be
dry
toast
and
butter
toast
,
muffin
and
crumpet
;
hot
bread
and
cold
bread
,
white
bread
and
brown
bread
,
home
-
make
bread
and
baker
'
bread
,
wheaten
bread
and
oaten
bread
;
and
if
there
be
other
bread
than
these
,
they
be
there
;
there
be
egg
in
napkin
,
and
crispy
bit
of
bacon
under
silver
cover
;
and
there
be
little
fish
in
a
little
box
,
and
devil
kidney
frizzle
on
a
hot
-
water
dish
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
place
closely
contiguous
to
the
plate
of
the
worthy
archdeacon
himself
.
<EOS>
over
and
above
this
,
on
a
snow
-
white
napkin
,
spread
upon
the
sideboard
,
be
a
huge
ham
and
a
huge
sirloin
;
the
latter
have
laden
the
dinner
table
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
ordinary
fare
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
I
have
never
find
the
rectory
a
pleasant
house
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
seem
to
be
somewhat
forget
;
and
noble
as
be
the
appearance
of
the
host
,
and
sweet
and
good
-
natured
as
be
the
face
of
the
hostess
,
talented
as
be
the
child
,
and
excellent
as
be
the
viand
and
the
wine
,
in
spite
of
these
attraction
,
I
generally
find
the
rectory
somewhat
dull
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
the
archdeacon
would
retire
,
of
course
to
his
clerical
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
,
I
presume
,
inspect
her
kitchen
,
though
she
have
a
first
-
rate
housekeeper
,
with
sixty
pound
a
year
;
and
attend
to
the
lesson
of
Florinda
and
Grizzel
,
though
she
have
an
excellent
governess
with
thirty
pound
a
year
:
<EOS>
but
at
any
rate
she
disappear
:
<EOS>
and
I
never
could
make
companion
of
the
boy
.
<EOS>
Charles
James
,
though
he
always
look
as
though
there
be
something
in
him
,
never
seem
to
have
much
to
say
;
and
what
he
do
say
he
would
always
unsay
the
next
minute
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
once
that
he
consider
cricket
,
on
the
whole
,
to
be
a
gentleman
-
like
game
for
boy
,
provide
they
would
play
without
run
about
;
and
that
five
,
also
,
be
a
seemly
game
,
so
that
those
who
play
it
never
heat
themselves
.
<EOS>
Henry
once
quarrel
with
me
for
take
his
sister
Grizzel
's
part
in
a
contest
between
them
as
to
the
good
mode
of
use
a
watering
-
pot
for
the
garden
flower
;
and
from
that
day
to
this
he
have
not
speak
to
me
,
though
he
speak
at
me
often
enough
.
<EOS>
for
half
an
hour
or
so
I
certainly
do
like
Sammy
's
gentle
speech
;
but
one
get
tired
of
honey
,
and
I
find
that
he
prefer
the
more
admiring
listener
whom
he
meet
in
the
kitchen
-
garden
and
back
precinct
of
the
establishment
;
besides
,
I
think
I
once
catch
Sammy
fibbing
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
therefore
,
I
find
the
rectory
a
dull
house
,
though
it
must
be
admit
that
everything
there
be
of
the
very
good
.
  
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
on
the
morning
of
which
we
be
write
,
the
archdeacon
,
as
usual
,
retire
to
his
study
,
intimate
that
he
be
go
to
be
very
busy
,
but
that
he
would
see
Mr
Chadwick
if
he
call
.
<EOS>
on
enter
this
sacred
room
he
carefully
open
the
paper
case
on
which
he
be
will
not
to
compose
his
favourite
sermon
,
and
spread
on
it
a
fair
sheet
of
paper
and
one
partly
write
on
;
he
then
place
his
inkstand
,
look
at
his
pen
,
and
fold
his
blot
paper
;
have
do
so
,
he
get
up
again
from
his
seat
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
and
yawn
comfortably
,
stretch
out
vastly
his
huge
arm
and
open
his
burly
chest
.
<EOS>
He
then
walk
across
the
room
and
lock
the
door
;
and
have
so
prepared
himself
,
he
throw
himself
into
his
easy
-
chair
,
take
from
a
secret
drawer
beneath
his
table
a
volume
of
Rabelais
,
and
begin
to
amuse
himself
with
the
witty
mischief
of
Panurge
;
and
so
pass
the
archdeacon
's
morning
on
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
leave
undisturbed
at
his
study
for
an
hour
or
two
,
when
a
knock
come
to
the
door
,
and
Mr
Chadwick
be
announce
.
<EOS>
Rabelais
retire
into
the
secret
drawer
,
the
easy
-
chair
seem
knowingly
to
betake
itself
off
,
and
when
the
archdeacon
quickly
undo
his
bolt
,
he
be
discover
by
the
steward
work
,
as
usual
,
for
that
church
of
which
he
be
so
useful
<EOS>
a
pillar
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
have
just
come
from
London
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
know
to
be
the
bearer
of
important
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
at
last
,
"
say
Mr
Chadwick
,
as
he
seat
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
well
!
"
exclaim
the
archdeacon
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
as
long
as
my
arm
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
it
can
not
be
tell
in
a
word
,
but
you
can
read
it
;
"
and
he
hand
him
a
copy
,
<EOS>
in
heaven
know
how
many
spin
-
out
folio
,
of
the
opinion
which
the
attorney
-
general
have
manage
to
cram
on
the
back
and
side
of
the
case
as
originally
submit
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
upshot
be
,
"
say
Chadwick
,
"
that
there
be
a
screw
loose
in
their
case
,
and
we
have
better
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
be
proceed
against
Mr
Harding
and
myself
,
and
Sir
Abraham
hold
that
,
under
the
wording
of
the
will
,
and
subsequent
arrangement
legally
sanction
,
Mr
Harding
and
I
be
only
pay
servant
.
<EOS>
the
defendant
should
have
be
either
the
Corporation
of
Barchester
,
or
possibly
the
chapter
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
w
-
hoo
!
"
say
the
archdeacon
;
"
so
Master
Bold
be
on
the
wrong
scent
,
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
;
but
any
scent
almost
would
be
a
wrong
scent
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
think
that
if
they
would
take
the
corporation
,
or
the
chapter
,
we
could
have
baffle
them
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
he
think
,
would
be
the
sure
shot
;
but
even
there
we
could
plead
that
the
bishop
be
only
a
visitor
,
and
that
he
have
never
make
himself
a
consent
party
to
the
performance
of
other
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
quite
clear
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
so
clear
,
"
say
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
the
will
say
,
"
My
lord
,
the
bishop
,
be
graciously
pleased
to
see
that
due
justice
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
it
may
be
a
question
whether
,
in
accept
and
administer
the
patronage
,
your
father
have
not
accept
also
the
other
duty
assign
.
<EOS>
It
be
doubtful
,
however
;
but
even
if
they
hit
that
nail
,
 
and
they
be
far
off
from
that
yet
,
 
the
point
be
so
nice
,
as
Sir
Abraham
say
,
that
you
would
force
them
into
fifteen
thousand
pound
'
cost
before
they
could
bring
it
to
an
issue
!
<EOS>
and
where
be
that
sum
of
money
to
come
from
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
rub
his
hand
with
delight
;
he
have
never
doubt
the
justice
of
his
case
,
but
he
have
begin
to
have
some
dread
of
unjust
success
on
the
part
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
to
him
thus
to
hear
that
their
cause
be
surround
with
such
rock
and
shoal
;
such
cause
of
shipwreck
unseen
by
the
landsman
's
eye
,
but
visible
enough
to
the
keen
eye
of
practical
law
mariner
.
<EOS>
how
wrong
his
wife
be
to
wish
that
Bold
should
marry
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
bold
!
<EOS>
why
,
if
he
should
be
ass
enough
to
persevere
,
he
would
be
a

I

Sir
Abraham

he
put
down
on

the

pat
it

of

it

how

their

<EOS>
"
quite
true

the

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
"
no

no

the

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs

be
very
interested

I

say
Mr
Chadwick
.
  
<EOS>
do
the
archdeacon
wink
,
or
do
he
not
?
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
he
do
not
quite
wink
;
but
that
without
such
,
perhaps
,
unseemly
gesture
he
communicate
to
Mr
Chadwick
,
with
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
intimation
that
,
deep
as
be
Mrs
Grantly
's
interest
in
the
matter
,
it
should
not
procure
for
her
a
perusal
of
that
document
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
partly
open
the
small
drawer
,
above
speak
of
,
deposit
the
paper
on
the
volume
of
Rabelais
,
and
show
to
Mr
Chadwick
the
nature
of
the
key
which
guard
these
hide
treasure
.
<EOS>
the
careful
steward
then
express
himself
contented
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
vain
man
!
<EOS>
he
could
fasten
up
his
Rabelais
,
and
other
thing
secret
,
with
all
the
skill
of
Bramah
or
of
Chubb
;
but
where
could
he
fasten
up
the
key
which
solve
these
mechanical
mystery
?
<EOS>
It
be
probable
to
us
that
the
content
of
no
drawer
in
that
house
be
unknown
to
its
mistress
,
and
we
think
,
moreover
,
that
she
be
entitle
to
all
such
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
Mr
Chadwick
,
"
we
must
,
of
course
,
tell
your

Mr

so
much

You
have
better
let

know

Sir

that

it
must
fall

they

be
nonsuite

if

you

you

Mr

well

you

and
he
shake
hand
with
the
diocesan
steward

bow
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
again
recourse
to
his
drawer
,
and
twice
read
through
the
essence
of
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
's
law
-
enlighten
and
law
-
bewilder
brain
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
clear
that
to
Sir
Abraham
,
the
justice
of
the
old
man
's
claim
or
the
justice
of
Mr
Harding
's
defence
be
idea
that
have
never
present
themselves
.
<EOS>
a
legal
victory
over
an
oppose
party
be
the
service
for
which
Sir
Abraham
be
,
as
he
imagine
,
to
be
pay
;
and
that
he
,
accord
to
his
light
,
have
diligently
labour
to
achieve
,
and
with
probable
hope
of
success
.
<EOS>
of
the
intense
desire
which
Mr
Harding
feel
to
be
assure
on
fit
authority
that
he
be
wrong
no
man
,
that
he
be
entitle
in
true
equity
to
his
income
,
that
he
may
sleep
at
night
without
pang
of
conscience
,
that
he
be
no
robber
,
no
spoiler
of
the
poor
;
that
he
and
all
the
world
may
be
openly
convinced
that
he
be
not
the
man
which
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
have
describe
him
to
be
;
of
such
longing
on
the
part
of
Mr
Harding
,
Sir
Abraham
be
entirely
ignorant
;
nor
,
indeed
,
could
it
be
look
on
as
part
of
his
business
to
gratify
such
desire
.
<EOS>
such
be
not
the
system
on
which
his
battle
be
fight
,
and
victory
gain
.
<EOS>
Success
be
his
object
,
and
he
be
generally
successful
.
<EOS>
He
conquer
his
enemy
by
their
weakness
rather
than
by
his
own
strength
,
and
it
have
be
find
almost
impossible
to
make
up
a
case
in
which
Sir
Abraham
,
as
an
antagonist
,
would
not
find
a
flaw
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
be
delighted
with
the
closeness
of
the
reasoning
.
<EOS>
to
do
him
justice
,
it
be
not
a
selfish
triumph
that
he
desire
;
he
would
personally
lose
nothing
by
defeat
,
or
at
least
what
he
may
lose
do
not
actuate
him
;
but
neither
be
it
love
of
justice
which
make
him
so
anxious
,
nor
even
mainly
solicitude
for
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
be
fight
a
part
of
a
never
-
end
battle
against
a
never
-
conquer
foe
 
that
of
the
church
against
its
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
Mr
Harding
could
not
pay
all
the
expense
of
these
doing
:
for
these
long
opinion
of
Sir
Abraham
's
,
these
cause
to
be
plead
,
these
speech
to
be
make
,
these
various
court
through
which
the
case
be
,
he
presume
,
to
be
drag
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
and
his
father
must
at
least
bear
the
heavy
portion
of
this
tremendous
cost
;
but
to
do
the
archdeacon
justice
,
he
do
not
recoil
from
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
fond
of
obtain
money
,
greedy
of
a
large
income
,
but
open
-
handed
enough
in
expend
it
,
and
it
be
a
triumph
to
him
to
foresee
the
success
of
this
measure
,
although
he
may
be
call
on
to
pay
so
dearly
for
it
himself
.
   
<EOS>
the
CONFERENCE
 
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
the
archdeacon
be
with
his
father
betime
,
and
a
note
be
send
down
to
the
warden
beg
his
attendance
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
,
as
he
cogitate
on
the
matter
,
lean
back
in
his
brougham
as
he
journey
into
Barchester
,
feel
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
communicate
his
own
satisfaction
either
to
his
father
or
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
want
success
on
his
own
side
and
discomfiture
on
that
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
want
peace
on
the
subject
;
a
settle
peace
if
possible
,
but
peace
at
any
rate
till
the
short
remainder
of
his
own
day
have
spin
itself
out
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
require
not
only
success
and
peace
,
but
he
also
demand
that
he
may
stand
justify
before
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
however
,
be
comparatively
easy
to
deal
with
;
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
other
,
the
dutiful
son
have
persuade
his
father
that
all
be
go
on
well
,
and
then
the
warden
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Harding
's
will
not
,
whenever
he
spend
a
morning
at
the
palace
,
to
seat
himself
immediately
at
the
bishop
's
elbow
,
the
bishop
occupy
a
huge
arm
-
chair
fit
up
with
candle
-
stick
,
a
reading
table
,
a
drawer
,
and
other
paraphernalia
,
the
position
of
which
chair
be
never
move
,
summer
or
winter
;
and
when
,
as
be
usual
,
the
archdeacon
be
there
also
,
he
confront
the
two
elder
,
who
thus
be
enable
to
fight
the
battle
against
him
together
;
 
and
together
submit
to
defeat
,
for
such
be
their
constant
fate
.
  
<EOS>
Our
warden
now
take
his
accustomed
place
,
have
greet
his
son
-
in
-
law
as
he
enter
,
and
then
affectionately
inquire
after
his
friend
's
health
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
gentleness
about
the
bishop
to
which
the
soft
womanly
affection
of
Mr
Harding
particularly
endear
itself
,
and
it
be
quaint
to
see
how
the
two
mild
old
priest
press
each
other
's
hand
,
and
smile
and
make
little
sign
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
have
come
at
last
,
"
begin
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
have
hear
so
much
,
and
be
most
anxious
to
know
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
favourable
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
press
his
friend
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
look
at
the
mighty
bearer
of
the
important
news
for
confirmation
of
these
glad
tiding
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
;
"
Sir
Abraham
have
give
most
minute
attention
to
the
case
;
indeed
,
I
know
he
would
;
 
most
minute
attention
;
and
his
opinion
be
,
 
and
as
to
his
opinion
on
such
a
subject
be
correct
,
no
one
who
know
Sir
Abraham
's
character
can
doubt
,
 
his
opinion
be
,
that
they
hav'n"t
get
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
as
how
,
archdeacon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
in
the
first
place
:
 
but
you
be
no
lawyer
,
warden
,
and
I
doubt
you
will
not
understand
it
;
the
gist
of
the
matter
be
this
:
 
under
Hiram
's
<EOS>
will
two
pay
guardian
have
be
select
for
the
hospital
;
the
law
will
say
two
pay
servant
,
and
you
and
I
will
not
quarrel
with
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
I
will
not
if
I
be
one
of
the
servant
,
"
say
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
rise
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
,
impatient
of
poetry
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
two
pay
servant
,
we
will
say
;
one
to
look
after
the
man
,
and
the
other
to
look
after
the
money
.
<EOS>
You
and
Chadwick
be
these
two
servant
,
and
whether
either
of
you
be
pay
too
much
,
or
too
little
,
more
or
less
in
fact
than
the
founder
will
,
it
be
as
clear
as
daylight
that
no
one
can
fall
foul
of
either
of
you
for
receive
an
allot
stipend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
do
seem
clear
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
who
have
wince
visibly
at
the
word
servant
and
stipend
,
which
,
however
,
appear
to
have
cause
no
uneasiness
to
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
clear
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
in
point
of
fact
,
it
be
necessary
to
select
such
servant
for
the
use
of
the
hospital
,
the
pay
to
be
give
to
them
must
depend
on
the
rate
of
pay
for
such
service
,
accord
to
their
market
value
at
the
period
in
question
;
and
those
who
manage
the
hospital
must
be
the
only
judge
of
this
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
who
do
manage
the
hospital
?
"
ask
the
warden
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
them
find
that
out
;
that
be
another
question
:
the
action
be
bring
against
you
and
Chadwick
;
that
be
your
defence
,
and
a
perfect
and
full
defence
it
be
.
<EOS>
now
that
I
think
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
look
inquiringly
up
into
his
friend
's
face
,
who
sit
silent
awhile
,
and
apparently
not
so
well
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
conclusive
,
"
continue
the
archdeacon
;
"
if
they
press
it
to
a
jury
,
which
they
will
not
do
,
no
twelve
man
in
England
will
take
five
minute
to
decide
against
them
.
"
  
"
but
accord
to
that
"
say
Mr
Harding
,
"
I
may
as
well
have
sixteen
hundred
a
year
as
eight
,
if
the
manager
choose
to
allot
it
to
me
;
and
as
I
be
one
of
the
manager
,
if
not
the

myself

that
can
hardly
be
a
just
arrangement

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
;
all
that
be
nothing
to
the
question

<EOS>
the
question
be
,
whether
this
intrude
fellow
,
and
a
lot
of
cheat
attorney
and
pestilent
dissenter
,
be
to
interfere
with
an
arrangement
which
everyone
know
be
essentially
just
and
serviceable
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
pray
do
not
let
us
be
splitting
hair
,
and
that
amongst
ourselves
,

<EOS>
there
will
never
be
an
end
of
the
cause

the
cost

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
again
sit
silent
for
a
while
,
during
which
the
bishop
once
and
again
press
his
arm
,
and
look
in
his
face
to
see
if
he
could
catch
a
gleam
of
a
contented
and
ease
mind
;
but
there
be
no
such
gleam
,
and
the
poor
warden
continue
play
sad
dirge
on
invisible
stringed
instrument
in
all
manner
of
position
;
he
be
ruminate
in
his
mind
on
this
opinion
of
Sir
Abraham
,
look
to
it
wearily
and
earnestly
for
satisfaction
,
but
find
none
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
"
do
you
see
the
opinion
,
archdeacon
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
say
he
have
not
,
 
that
be
to
say
,
he
have
,
 
that
be
,
he
have
not
see
the
opinion
itself
;
he
have
see
what
have
be
call
a
copy
,
but
he
could
not
say
whether
of
a
whole
or
part
;
nor
could
he
say
that
what
he
have
see
be
the
_
ipsissima
verba
_
of
the
great
man
himself
;
but
what
he
have
see
contain
exactly
the
decision
which
he
have
announce
,
and
which
he
again
declare
to
be
to
his
mind
extremely
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
opinion
,
"
say
the
warden
;
"
that
is
,
a
copy
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
suppose
you
can
if
you
make
a
point
of
it
;
but
I
do
not
see
the
use
myself
;
of
course
it
be
essential
that
the
purport

it

ask
the

"
what
a
question
for

man
to
ask
!

the
archdeacon

throw
up
his
hand
in

of
his
surprise
;

it
be
like
you
:

a
child
be
not
more
innocent
than
you
be
in
matter
of
business
.
<EOS>
can
not
you
see
that
if
we
tell
them
that
no
action
will
lie
against
you
,

that
one
may
possibly
lie
against
some
other
person
or
person
,
that
we
shall
be
put
weapon
into
their
hand
,
and
be
teach
them
how
to
cut
our
own
throat
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
warden
again
sit
silent
,

the
bishop
again
look
at
him
wistfully
.
<EOS>
"
the
only
thing
we
have
now
to
do
,
"
continue
the
archdeacon
,
"
be
to
remain
quiet
,
hold
our
peace
,

let
them
play
their
own
game
as
they
please

"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
to
make
known
then

the
warden

that
we
have
consult
the
attorney

general

advise

him

will
be
fully

carry
out

God
bless
my
soul

the

how
odd
it
be
that
you
will
not
see
that
all
we
be
to
do
be
to
do
nothing

:
why
should
we
say
anything
about
the
founder

will

<EOS>
We
be
in
possession
;

we
know
that
they

put
us
out

surely
that
be
enough
for
the
present

<EOS>
Mr
Harding
rise
from
his

pace
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
library
,
the
bishop
the
while
watch
him
painfully
at
every
turn

the
archdeacon
continue
to
pour
forth
his
conviction
that

to
satisfy

the

trivial

stir
up
the

the
archdeacon
again
look
exceedingly
know

worldly
wise

<EOS>
the
warden
continue
his
walk
;
the
hard
and
stinging
word
of
that
newspaper
article

each
one
of
which
have
thrust
a
thorn
as
it

into
his
inmost
soul

be
fresh
in
his
memory
;
he
have
read
it
more
than
once
,
word
by
word
,
and
what
be
bad
,
he
fancy
it
be
as
well
known
to
everyone
as
to
himself

<EOS>
be
he
to
be
look
on
as
the
unjust
griping
priest
he
have
be
there
describe
?
<EOS>
be
he
to
be
point
at
as
the
consumer
of
the
bread
of
the
poor
,

to
be
allow
no
means
of
refute
such
charge
,
of
clear
his
begrime
name

of
stand
innocent
in
the
world

as
hitherto
he
have
stand
?
<EOS>
be
he
to
bear
all
this

to
receive
as
usual
his
now
hate
income

be
know
as
one
of
those
greedy
priest
who
by
their
rapacity
have
bring
disgrace
on
their
church

<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
why
should
he
bear
all
this

<EOS>
why
should
he
die

for
he
feel
that
he
could
not

under
such
a
weight
of
obloquy

<EOS>
as
he
pace
up
and
down
the
room
he
resolve
in
his
misery
and
enthusiasm
that
he
could
with
pleasure
,
if
he
be
allow
,
give
up
his
place
,
abandon
his
pleasant
home
,
leave
the
hospital

live
poorly
,
happily
,

with
an
unsullied
name
,
on
the
small
remainder
of
his
mean
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
somewhat
shy
of
speak
of
himself
,
even
before
those
who
know
him
best
,
and
whom
he
love
the
most
;
but
at
last
it
burst
forth
from
him
,
and
with
a
somewhat
jerk
eloquence
he
declare
that
he
could
not
,
would
not
,
bear
this
misery
any
longer

<EOS>
"
if

at

that
I

appeal

almost
in

indifferent

such

loudly
of
me

<EOS>
the
bishop
could
feel
for
him

sympathise
with
him

he
could
not
advise
him
;
he
could
only
say
,
"
no

no

you
shall

ask

Theophilus

<EOS>
but
the
archdeacon
,
though
he
could
not
sympathise

could
advise
;
and
he
see
that
the
time
have
come
when
it
behove
him
to
do
so
in
a
somewhat
peremptory
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
lord

"
he
say
,
speak
to
his
father
;

when
he
call
his
father
"
my
lord

the
good
old
bishop
shake
in
his
shoe

he
know

an
evil
time
be
come

<EOS>

why

my

there
be
two
way
of
give
advice

there
be
advice

may

good

the
present
day

there
be
advice
that
may
be
good
for
day
to
come

now
I
can

myself
to
give
the
former

it

<EOS>
"
no

no

no

seat
himself

shade
his

with
his

<EOS>
Mr

sit
down
with
his

to
the
further
wall

play
to
himself
some
air
fit
for
so
calamitous
an
occasion

the
archdeacon
say
out
his
say
standing
,
with
his
back
to
the
empty
fire
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
but
that
much
pain
will
spring
out
of
this
unnecessarily
raise
question
.
<EOS>
We
must
all
have
foresee
that
,
and
the
matter
have
in
no
wise
go
on
bad
than
we
expect
;
but
it
will
be
weak
,
yes
,
and
wicked
also
,
to
abandon
the
cause
and
own
ourselves
wrong
,
because
the
inquiry
be
painful
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
ourselves
we
have
to
look
to
;
to
a
certain
extent
the
interest
of
the
church
be
in
our
keeping
.
<EOS>
Should
it
be
find
that
one
after
another
of
those
who
hold
preferment
abandon
it
whenever
it
may
be
attack
,
<EOS>
be
it
not
plain
that
such
attack
would
be
renew
till
nothing
be
leave
us
?
<EOS>
and
,
that
if
so
deserted
,
the
Church
of
England
must
fall
to
the
ground
altogether
?
<EOS>
if
this
be
true
of
many

it
be
true
of
one

<EOS>
be
you
,
accuse
as
you
now
be

to
throw
up
the
wardenship
,
and
to
relinquish
the
preferment
which
be
your
property
,
with
the
vain
object
of
prove
yourself
disintereste
,
you
would
fail
in
that
object
,
you
would
inflict
a
desperate
blow
on
your
brother
clergyman
,
you
would
encourage
every
cantankerous
dissenter
in
England
to
make
a
similar
charge
against
some
source
of
clerical
revenue
,
and
you
would
do
your
good
to
dishearten
those
who
be
most
anxious
to
defend
you
and
uphold
your
position

<EOS>
I
can
fancy
nothing
more
weak
,
or
more
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
you
think
that
there
be
any
justice
in
these
charge

or
that
you
doubt
your
own
right
to
the
wardenship

you
be
convince
of
your

yet
would
yield
to
them
through
cowardice

"
  
<EOS>
"
Cowardice
!

the

expostulate

<EOS>
Mr

sit
unmoved

gaze
on
his
son
-
in

law

<EOS>
"
well
;
would
it
not

cowardice

Would
he
not

so

the
evil

falsely
speak

<EOS>
Would
that
not

cowardice

<EOS>
and
now
let
us
see
the
extent
of
the
evil
which
you
dread
.
<EOS>
the
_
Jupiter
_
publish
an
article
which
a
great
many
,
no
doubt
,
will
read
;
but
of
those
who
understand
the
subject
how
many
will
believe
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
?
<EOS>
everyone
know
what
its
object
be
:
it
have
take
up
the
case
against
Lord
Guildford
and
against
the
Dean
of
Rochester
,
and
that
against
half
a
dozen
bishop
;
and
do
not
everyone
know
that
it
would
take
up
any
case
of
the
kind
,
right
or
wrong
,
false
or
true
,
with
know
justice
or
know
injustice
,
if
by
do
so
it
could
further
its
own
view
?
<EOS>
do
not
all
the
world
know
this
of
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
?
<EOS>
who
that
really
know
you
will
think
the
bad
of
you
for
what
_
the
Jupiter
_
say
?
<EOS>
and
why
care
for
those
who
do
not
know
you
?
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
your
own
comfort
,
but
I
do
say
that
you
could
not
be
justify
in
throw
up
,
in
a
fit
of
passion
,
for
such
it
would
be
,
the
only
maintenance
that
Eleanor
have
;
and
if
you
do
so
,
if
you
really
do
vacate
the
wardenship
,
and
submit
to
ruin
,
what
would
that
profit
you
?
<EOS>
if
you
have
no
future
right
to
the
income
,
you
have
have
no
past
right
to
it
;
and
the
very
fact
of
your
abandon
your
position
would
create
a
demand
for
repayment
of
that
which
you
have
already
receive
and
spend
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
poor
warden
groan
as
he
sit
perfectly
still
,
look
up
at
the
hard
-
hearted
orator
who
thus
torment
him
,
and
the
bishop
echo
the
sound
faintly
from
behind
his
hand
;
but
the
archdeacon
care
little
for
such
sign
of
weakness
,
and
complete
his
exhortation
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
let
us
suppose
the
office
to
be
leave
vacant
,
and
that
your
own
trouble
concern
it
be
over
;
would
that
satisfy
you
?
<EOS>
be
your
only
aspiration
in
the
matter
confine
to
yourself
and
family

<EOS>
I
know
they
be
not

<EOS>
I
know
you
be
as
anxious
as
any
of
us
for
the
church
to
which
we
belong

and
what
a
grievous
blow
would
such
an
act

apostasy
give
her
!
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
the
church
of
which
you
be
a
member

a
minister

to
bear
with
this
affliction

however
severe
it
may
be

you
owe
it
to
my
father

who
institute
you

to
support
his

you

to
maintain
uninjured

them
that
which
you
receive
uninjured

you

to
us
all
the
unflinching
assistance
of
perfect
brotherhood
in
this

another

support
our
great

and
so
the
archdeacon
cease

stand
self

satisfy

watch
the
effect
of
his
spoken
wisdom

<EOS>
the
warden
feel
himself
,
to
a
certain
extent

stifle

he
would
have
give
the
world
to
get
himself
out
into
the
open
air
without
speak
to

or
notice
those
who
be
in

him

this
be
impossible

<EOS>
He
could
not
leave
without
say
something
,
and
he
feel
himself
confound
by
the
archdeacon
's
eloquence
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
heavy
,
unfeeling
,
unanswerable
truth
in
what
he
have
say
;
there
be
so
much
practical
,
but
odious
common
sense
in
it
,
that
he
neither
know
how
to
assent
or
to
differ
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
suffer
,
he
feel
that
he
could
endure
without
complaint
and
without
cowardice
,
provide
that
he
be
self
-
satisfy
of
the
justice
of
his
own
cause

<EOS>
what
he
could
not
endure
be
,
that
he
should
be
accuse
by
other
,
and
not
acquit
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Doubting
,
as
he
have
begin
to
doubt
,
the
justice
of
his
own
position
in
the
hospital
,
he
know
that
his
own
self

confidence
would
not
be
restore
because
Mr
Bold
have
be
in
error
as
to
some
legal
form
;
nor
could
he
be
satisfied
to
escape
,
because
,
through
some
legal
fiction
,
he
who
receive
the
great
benefit
from
the
hospital
may
be
consider
only
as
one
of
its
servant

<EOS>
the

speech
have
silence
him

stupefy
him

annihilate
him
;
anything

satisfy
him

<EOS>
with
the
bishop
it
fare
not
much
well
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
discern
clearly
how
thing
be
,
but
he
see
enough
to
know
that
a
battle
be
to
be
prepare
for
;
a
battle
that
would
destroy
his
few
remain
comfort

bring
him
with
sorrow
to
the
grave

the

till
his
thought
fix
themselves
wholly
on
the
mean
of
escape
from
his
present
position
,
and
he
feel
like
a
bird
fascinate
by
gaze
on
a
snake
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
,
"
say
the
archdeacon
at
last
,
break
the
dread
silence
<EOS>
;
"
my
lord
,
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
sigh
the
bishop
give
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
,
"
again
repeat
the
merciless
tyrant
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
"
groan
the
poor
old
man
,
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
,
warden
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
now
stir
to
action
;
 
he
must
speak
and
move
,
so
he
get
up
and
take
one
turn
before
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
press
me
for
an
answer
just
at
present
;
I
will
do
nothing
lightly
in
the
matter
,
and
of
whatever
I
do
I
will
give
you
and
the
bishop
notice
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
without
another
word
he
take
his
leave
,
escape
quickly
through
the
palace
hall
,
and
down
the
lofty
step
;
nor
do
he
breathe
freely
till
he
find
himself
alone
under
the
huge
elm
of
the
silent
close
.
<EOS>
here
he
walk
long
and
slowly
,
think
on
his
case
with
a
troubled
air
,
and
try
in
vain
to
confute
the
archdeacon
's
argument
.
<EOS>
He
then
go
home
,
resolve
to
bear
it
all
,
 
ignominy
,
suspense
,
disgrace
,
self
-
doubt
,
and
heart
-
burn
,
  
and
to
do
as
those
would
have
him
,
who
he
still
believe
be
most
fit
and
most
able
to
counsel
him
aright
.
   
<EOS>
tribulation
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
a
sad
man
than
he
have
ever
yet
be
when
he
return
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
wretched
enough
on
that
well
-
remember
morning
when
he
be
force
to
expose
before
his
son
-
in
-
law
<EOS>
the
publisher
's
account
for
usher
into
the
world
his
dear
book
of
sacred
music
:
when
after
make
such
payment
as
he
could
do
unassisted
,
he
find
that
he
be
a
debtor
of
more
than
three
hundred
pound
;
but
his
suffering
then
be
as
nothing
to
his
present
misery
;
 
then
he
have
do
wrong
,
and
he
know
it
,
and
be
able
to
resolve
that
he
would
not
sin
in
like
manner
again
;
but
now
he
could
make
no
resolution
,
and
comfort
himself
by
no
promise
of
firmness
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
force
to
think
that
his
lot
have
place
him
in
a
false
position
,
and
he
be
about
to
maintain
that
position
against
the
opinion
of
the
world
and
against
his
own
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
read
with
pity
,
amount
almost
to
horror
,
the
stricture
which
have
appear
from
time
to
time
against
the
Earl
of
Guildford
as
master
of
St
Cross
,
and
the
invective
that
have
be
heap
on
rich
diocesan
dignitary
and
overgrow
sinecure
pluralist
.
<EOS>
in
judge
of
them
,
he
judge
leniently
;
the
whole
bias
of
his
profession
have
teach
him
to
think
that
they
be
more
sin
against
than
sin
,
and
that
the
animosity
with
which
they
have
be
pursue
be
venomous
and
unjust
;
but
he
have
not
the
less
regard
their
plight
as
most
miserable
.
<EOS>
His
hair
have
stand
on
end
and
his
flesh
have
creep
as
he
read
the
thing
which
have
be
write
;
he
have
wonder
how
man
could
live
under
such
a
load
of
disgrace
;
how
they
could
face
their
fellow
-
creature
while
their
name
be
bandy
about
so
injuriously
and
so
publicly
;
 
and
now
this
lot
be
to
be
his
,
 
he
,
that
shy
,
retire
man
,
who
have
so
comfort
himself
in
the
hidden
obscurity
of
his
lot
,
who
have
so
enjoy
the
unassume
warmth
of
his
own
little
corner
,
 
he
be
now
drag
forth
into
the
glaring
day
,
and
gibbet
before
ferocious
multitude
.
<EOS>
He
enter
his
own
house
a
crestfallen
,
humiliated
man
,
without
a
hope
of
overcome
the
wretchedness
which
affect
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
wander
into
the
drawing
-
room
where
be
his
daughter
;
but
he
could
not
speak
to
her
now
,
so
he
leave
it
,
and
go
into
the
book
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
quick
enough
to
escape
Eleanor
's
glance
,
or
to
prevent
her
from
see
that
he
be
disturb
;
and
in
a
little
while
she
follow
him
.
<EOS>
She
find
him
seat
in
his
accustomed
chair
with
no
book
open
before
him
,
no
pen
ready
in
his
hand
,
no
ill
-
shapen
note
of
blot
music
lie
before
him
as
be
usual
,
none
of
those
hospital
account
with
which
he
be
so
precise
and
yet
so
unmethodical
:
he
be
do
nothing
,
think
of
nothing
,
look
at
nothing
;
he
be
merely
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
me
,
Eleanor
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
;
"
leave
me
,
my
darling
,
for
a
few
minute
,
for
I
be
busy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
see
well
how
it
be
,
but
she
do
leave
him
,
and
glide
silently
back
to
her
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
sit
a
while
,
thus
alone
and
unoccupied
,
he
get
up
to
walk
again
;
 
he
could
make
more
of
his
thought
walk
than
sit
,
and
be
creep
out
into
his
garden
,
when
he
meet
Bunce
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Bunce
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
tone
that
for
him
be
sharp
,
"
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
do
you
want
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
come
to
ask
after
your
reverence
,
"
say
the
old
bedesman
,
touch
his
hat
;
"
and
to
inquire
about
the
news
from
London
,
"
he
add
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
the
warden
wince
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
feel
bewilder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Attorney
Finney
have
be
there
this
morning
,
"
continue
Bunce
,
"
and
by
his
look
I
guess
he
be
not
so
well
pleased
as
he
once
be
,
and
it
have
get
abroad
somehow
that
the
archdeacon
have
have
down
great
news
from
London
,
and
Handy
and
Moody
be
both
as
black
as
devil
.
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
"
say
the
man
,
try
to
assume
a
cheery
tone
,
"
that
thing
be
look
up
,
and
that
there
will
be
an
end
soon
to
all
this
stuff
which
bother
your
reverence
so
sorely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
wish
there
may
be
,
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
about
the
news
,
your
reverence
?
"
say
the
old
man
,
almost
whispering
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
walk
on
,
and
shake
his
head
impatiently
.
<EOS>
poor
Bunce
little
know
how
he
be
torment
his
patron
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
anything
to
cheer
you
,
I
should
be
so
glad
to
know
it
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
tone
of
affection
which
the
warden
in
all
his
misery
could
not
resist
.
  
<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
take
both
the
old
man
's
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
my
dear
old
friend
,
there
be
nothing
;
there
be
no
news
to
cheer
me
;
 
God
's
will
be
do
"
:
and
two
small
hot
tear
break
away
from
his
eye
and
steal
down
his
furrowed
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
God
's
will
be
do
,
"
say
the
other
solemnly
;
"
but
they
tell
me
that
there
be
good
news
from
London
,
and
I
come
to
wish
your
reverence
joy
;
but
God
's
will
be
do
;
"
and
so
the
warden
again
walk
on
,
and
<EOS>
the
bedesman
,
look
wistfully
after
him
and
receive
no
encouragement
to
follow
,
return
sadly
to
his
own
abode
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
couple
of
hour
the
warden
remain
thus
in
the
garden
,
now
walk
,
now
stand
motionless
on
the
turf
,
and
then
,
as
his
leg
get
weary
,
sit
unconsciously
on
the
garden
seat
,
and
then
walk
again
.
<EOS>
and
Eleanor
,
hide
behind
the
muslin
curtain
of
the
window
,
watch
him
through
the
tree
as
he
now
come
in
sight
,
and
then
again
be
conceal
by
the
turning
of
the
walk
;
and
thus
the
time
pass
away
till
five
,
when
the
warden
creep
back
to
the
house
and
prepare
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
sorry
meal
.
<EOS>
the
demure
parlour
-
maid
,
as
she
hand
the
dish
and
change
the
plate
,
see
that
all
be
not
right
,
and
be
more
demure
than
ever
:
neither
father
nor
daughter
could
eat
,
and
the
hateful
food
be
soon
clear
away
,
and
the
bottle
of
port
place
upon
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
bunce
to
come
in
,
papa
?
"
say
Eleanor
,
think
that
the
company
of
the
old
man
may
lighten
his
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
,
thank
you
,
not
to
-
day
;
but
be
not
you
go
out
,
Eleanor
,
this
lovely
afternoon
?
<EOS>
do
not
stay
in
for
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
seem
so
sad
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sad
,
"
say
he
,
irritate
;
"
well
,
people
must
all
have
their
share
of
sadness
here
;
I
be
not
more
exempt
than
another
:
but
kiss
me
,
dear
,
and
go
now
;
I
will
,
if
possible
,
be
more
sociable
when
you
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
Eleanor
be
again
banish
from
her
father
's
sorrow
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
her
desire
now
be
not
to
find
him
happy
,
but
to
be
allow
to
share
his
sorrow
;
not
to
force
him
to
be
sociable
,
but
to
persuade
him
to
be
trustful
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
on
her
bonnet
as
desire
,
and
go
up
to
Mary
Bold
;
this
be
now
her
daily
haunt
,
for
John
Bold
be
up
in
London
among
lawyer
and
church
reformer
,
dive
deep
into
other
question
than
that
of
the
wardenship
of
Barchester
;
supply
information
to
one
member
of
Parliament
,
and
dining
with
another
;
subscribe
to
fund
for
the
abolition
of
clerical
income
,
and
second
at
that
great
national
meeting
at
the
Crown
and
Anchor
a
resolution
to
the
effect
,
that
no
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
,
be
he
who
he
may
,
should
have
more
than
a
thousand
a
year
,
and
none
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
speech
on
this
occasion
be
short
,
for
fifteen
have
to
speak
,
and
the
room
be
hire
for
two
hour
only
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
the
Quakers
and
Mr
Cobden
be
to
make
use
of
it
for
an
appeal
to
the
public
in
aid
of
the
Emperor
of
Russia
;
but
it
be
sharp
and
effective
;
at
least
he
be
tell
so
by
a
companion
with
whom
he
now
live
much
,
and
on
whom
he
greatly
depend
,
 
one
Tom
Towers
,
a
very
leading
genius
,
and
suppose
to
have
high
employment
on
the
staff
of
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
.
  
<EOS>
so
Eleanor
,
as
be
now
her
will
not
,
go
up
to
Mary
Bold
,
and
Mary
listen
kindly
,
while
the
daughter
speak
much
of
her
father
,
and
,
perhaps
kinder
still
,
find
a
listener
in
Eleanor
,
while
she
speak
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
warden
sit
alone
,
lean
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
;
he
have
pour
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
but
have
do
so
merely
from
habit
,
for
he
leave
it
untouched
;
there
he
sit
gaze
at
the
open
window
,
and
thinking
,
if
he
can
be
say
to
have
think
,
of
the
happiness
of
his
past
life
.
<EOS>
all
manner
of
past
delight
come
before
his
mind
,
which
at
the
time
he
have
enjoy
without
consider
them
;
his
easy
day
,
his
absence
of
all
kind
of
hard
work
,
his
pleasant
shady
home
,
those
twelve
old
neighbour
whose
welfare
till
now
have
be
the
source
of
so
much
pleasant
care
,
the
excellence
of
his
child
,
the
friendship
of
the
dear
old
bishop
,
the
solemn
grandeur
of
those
vault
aisle
,
through
which
he
love
to
hear
his
own
voice
pealing
;
and
then
that
friend
of
friend
,
that
choice
ally
that
have
never
desert
him
,
that
eloquent
companion
that
would
always
,
when
ask
,
discourse
such
pleasant
music
,
that
violoncello
of
his
;
 
ah
,
how
happy
he
have
be
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
over
now
;
his
easy
day
and
absence
of
work
have
be
the
crime
which
bring
on
him
his
tribulation
;
his
shady
home
be
pleasant
no
longer
;
maybe
it
be
no
longer
his
;
the
old
neighbour
,
whose
welfare
have
be
so
desire
by
him
,
be
his
enemy
;
his
daughter
be
as
wretched
as
himself
;
and
even
the
bishop
be
make
miserable
by
his
position
.
<EOS>
He
could
never
again
lift
up
his
voice
boldly
as
he
have
hitherto
do
among
his
brother
,
for
he
feel
that
he
be
disgrace
;
and
he
fear
even
to
touch
his
bow
,
for
he
know
how
grievous
a
sound
of
wailing
,
how
piteous
a
lamentation
,
it
would
produce
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
sit
in
the
same
chair
and
the
same
posture
,
have
hardly
move
a
limb
for
two
hour
,
when
Eleanor
come
back
to
tea
,
and
succeed
in
bring
him
with
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
tea
seem
as
comfortless
as
the
dinner
,
though
the
warden
,
who
have
hitherto
eat
nothing
all
day
,
devour
the
plateful
of
bread
and
butter
,
unconscious
of
what
he
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
make
up
her
mind
to
force
him
to
talk
to
her
,
but
she
hardly
know
how
to
commence
:
she
must
wait
till
the
urn
be
go
,
till
the
servant
would
no
longer
be
come
in
and
out
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
everything
be
go
,
and
the
drawing
-
room
door
be
permanently
closed
;
then
Eleanor
,
get
up
and
go
round
to
her
father
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
say
,
"
Papa
,
will
not
you
tell
me
what
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
what
be
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
new
sorrow
that
torment
you
;
I
know
you
be
unhappy
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
new
sorrow
!
<EOS>
it
be
no
new
sorrow
,
my
dear
;
we
have
all
our

and
he
try
to
smile
,
but
it
be
a
ghastly
failure
;

I
should
not
be
so
dull
a
companion

come

we
will
have
some
music

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
papa
,
not
tonight

it
would
only
trouble
you
tonight

and
she
sit
upon
his
knee
,
as
she
sometimes
would
in
their
gay
mood
,
and
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
she
say
:
"
Papa
,
I
will
not
leave
you
till
you
talk
to
me
;
oh
,
if
you
only
know
how
much
good
it
would
do
to
you
,
to
tell
me
of
it
all

"
  
<EOS>
the
father
kiss
his
daughter
,
and
press
her
to
his
heart
;
but
still
he
say
nothing
:
it
be
so
hard
to
him
to
speak
of
his
own
sorrow
;
he
be
so
shy
a
man
even
with
his
own
child
!
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
,
do
tell
me
what
it
be
<EOS>
;
I
know
it
be
about
the
hospital
,
and
what
they
be
do
up
in
London
,
and
what
that
cruel
newspaper
have
say
;
but
if
there
be
such
cause
for
sorrow
,
let
us
be
sorrowful
together
;
we
be
all
in
all
to
each
other
now
:
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
papa
,
do
speak
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
could
not
well
speak
now
,
for
the
warm
tear
be
run
down
his
cheek
like
rain
in
May
,
but
he
hold
his
child
close
to
his
heart
,
and
squeeze
her
hand
as
a
lover
may
,
and
she
kiss
his
forehead
and
his
wet
cheek
,
and
lie
upon
his
bosom
,
and
comfort
him
as
a
woman
only
can
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
child
,
"
he
say
,
as
soon
as
his
tear
would
let
him
speak
,
"
my
own
,
own
child
,
why
should
you
too
be
unhappy
before
it
be
necessary
?
<EOS>
It
may
come
to
that
,
that
we
must
leave
this
place
,
but
till
that
time
come
,
why
should
your
young
day
be
cloud
?

"
and
be
that
all
,
papa
?
<EOS>
if
that
be
all
,
let
us
leave
it
,
and
have
light
heart
elsewhere
:
if
that
be
all
,
let
us
go

<EOS>
oh
,
papa
,
you
and
I
could
be
happy
if
we
have
only
bread
to
eat
,
so
long

our

be
light

"
  
<EOS>
and
Eleanor
's
face
be
light
up
with
enthusiasm
as
she
tell
her
father
how
he
may
banish
all
his
care
;
and
a
gleam
of
joy
shoot
across
his
brow
as
this
idea
of
escape
again
present
itself
,
and
he
again
fancy
for
a
moment
that
he
could
spurn
away
from
him
the
income
which
the
world
envy
him
;
that
he
could
give
the
lie
to
that
wielder
of
the
tomahawk
who
have
dare
to
write
such
thing
of
him
in
_
the
Jupiter
_
;
that
he
could
leave
Sir
Abraham
,
and
the
archdeacon
,
and
Bold
,
and
the
rest
of
them
with
their
lawsuit
among
them
,
and
wipe
his
hand
altogether
of
so
sorrow
-
stir
a
concern
.
<EOS>
ah
,
what
happiness
may
there
be
in
the
distance
,
with
Eleanor
and
him
in
some
small
cottage
,
and
nothing
leave
of
their
former
grandeur
but
their
music
!
<EOS>
yes
,
they
would
walk
forth
with
their
music
book
,
and
their
instrument
,
and
shake
the
dust
from
off
their
foot
as
they
go
,
leave
the
ungrateful
place
.
<EOS>
never
do
a
poor
clergyman
sigh
for
a
warm
benefice
more
anxiously
than
our
warden
<EOS>
do
now
to
be
rid
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
it
up
,
papa
,
"
she
say
again
,
jump
from
his
knee
and
stand
on
her
foot
before
him
,
look
boldly
into
his
face
;
"
give
it
up
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
sad
to
see
how
that
momentary
gleam
of
joy
pass
away
;
how
the
look
of
hope
be
disperse
from
that
sorrowful
face
,
as
the
remembrance
of
the
archdeacon
come
back
upon
our
poor
warden
,
and
he
reflect
that
he
could
not
stir
from
his
now
hate
post
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
a
man
bind
with
iron
,
fetter
with
adamant
<EOS>
:
he
be
in
no
respect
a
free
agent
;
he
have
no
choice
.
"
<EOS>
give
it
up
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
if
he
only
could
:
what
an
easy
way
that
be
out
of
all
his
trouble
!
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
do
not
doubt
about
it
,
"
she
continue
,
think
that
his
hesitation
arise
from
his
unwillingness
to
abandon
so
comfortable
a
home
;
"
be
it
on
my
account
that
you
would
stay
here

do
you
think
that
I
can
not

happy
without
a
pony

carriage
and
a
fine
drawing

room

<EOS>
papa
,
I
never
can
be
happy
here
,
as
long
as
there
be
a
question
as
to
your
honour
in
stay
here
;
but
I
could
be
gay
as
the
day
be
long
in
the
small
tiny
little
cottage
,
if
I
could
see
you
come
in
and
go
out
with
a
light
heart
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
papa
,
your
face
tell
so
much
;
though
you
will
not
speak
to
me
with
your
voice
,
I
know
how
it
be
with
you
every
time
I
look
at
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
how
he
press
her
to
his
heart
again
with
almost
a
spasmodic
pressure
!
<EOS>
how
he
kiss
her
as
the
tear
fall
like
rain
from
his
old
eye
!
<EOS>
how
he
bless
her
,
and
call
her
by
a
hundred
soft
sweet
name
which
now
come
new
to
his
lip
!
<EOS>
how
he
chide
himself
for
ever
have
be
unhappy
with
such
a
treasure
in
his
house
,
such
a
jewel
on
his
bosom
,
with
so
sweet
a
flower
in
the
choice
garden
of
his
heart
!
<EOS>
and
then
the
floodgate
of
his
tongue
be
loose
,
and
,
at
length
,
with
unspare
detail
of
circumstance
,
he
tell
her
all
that
he
wish
,
and
all
that
he
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
those
argument
of
the
archdeacon
,
not
agree
in
their
truth
,
but
explain
his
inability
to
escape
from
them
;
 
how
it
have
be
declare
to
him
that
he
be
bind
to
remain
where
he
be
by
the
interest
of
his
order
,
by
gratitude
to
the
bishop
,
by
the
wish
of
his
friend
,
by
a
sense
of
duty
,
which
,
though
he
could
not
understand
it
,
he
be
fain
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
how
he
have
be
accuse
of
cowardice
,
and
though
he
be
not
a
man
to
make
much
of
such
a
charge
before
the
world
,
now
in
the
full
candour
of
his
heart
he
explain
to
her
that
such
an
accusation
be
grievous
to
him
;
that
he
do
think
it
would
be
unmanly
to
desert
his
post
,
merely
to
escape
his
present
suffering
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
he
must
bear
as
best
he
may
the
misery
which
be
prepare
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
do
she
find
these
detail
tedious
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no
;
she
encourage
him
to
dilate
on
every
feeling
he
express
,
till
he
lay
bare
the
inmost
corner
of
his
heart
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
speak
together
of
the
archdeacon
,
as
two
child
may
of
a
stern
,
unpopular
,
but
still
respect
schoolmaster
,
and
of
the
bishop
as
a
parent
kind
as
kind
could
be
,
but
powerless
against
an
omnipotent
pedagogue
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
when
they
have
discuss
all
this
,
when
the
father
have
tell
all
to
the
child
,
she
could
not
be
less
confiding
than
he
have
be
;
and
as
John
Bold
's
name
be
mention
between
them
,
she
own
how
well
she
have
learn
to
love
him
<EOS>
,
 
"
have
love
him
once
,
"
she
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
,
could
not
do
so
now
 
no
,
even
have
her
troth
be
plight
to
him
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
take
it
back
again
;
 
have
she
swear
to
love
him
as
his
wife
,
she
would
have
discard
him
,
and
not
feel
herself
forswear
,
when
he
prove
himself
the
enemy
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
warden
declare
that
Bold
be
no
enemy
of
his
,
and
encourage
her
love
;
and
gently
rebuke
,
as
he
kiss
her
,
the
stern
resolve
she
have
make
to
cast
him
off
;
and
then
he
speak
to
her
of
happy
day
when
their
trial
would
all
be
over
;
and
declare
that
her
young
heart
should
not
be
tear
asunder
to
please
either
priest
or
prelate
,
dean
or
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
all
Oxford
be
to
convocate
together
,
and
agree
as
to
the
necessity
of
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
they
greatly
comfort
each
other
;
 
and
in
what
sorrow
will
not
such
mutual
confidence
give
consolation
!
 
<EOS>
and
with
a
last
expression
of
tender
love
they
part
,
and
go
comparatively
happy
to
their
room
.
   
<EOS>
IPHIGENIA
 
<EOS>
when
Eleanor
lay
her
head
on
her
pillow
that
night
,
her
mind
be
anxiously
intent
on
some
plan
by
which
she
may
extricate
her
father
from
his
misery
;
and
,
in
her
warm
-
hearted
enthusiasm
,
self
-
sacrifice
be
decide
on
as
the
mean
to
be
adopt
.
<EOS>
be
not
so
good
an
Agamemnon
worthy
of
an
Iphigenia
?
<EOS>
She
would
herself
personally
implore
John
Bold
to
desist
from
his
undertaking
;
she
would
explain
to
him
her
father
's
sorrow
,
the
cruel
misery
of
his
position
;
she
would
tell
him
how
her
father
would
die
if
he
be
thus
drag
before
the
public
and
expose
to
such
unmerited
ignominy
;
she
would
appeal
to
his
old
friendship
,
to
his
generosity
,
to
his
manliness
,
to
his
mercy
;
if
need
be
,
she
would
kneel
to
him
for
the
favour
she
would
ask
;
but
before
she
do
this
the
idea
of
love
must
be
banish
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
no
bargain
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
to
his
mercy
,
to
his
generosity
,
she
could
appeal
;
but
as
a
pure
maiden
,
hitherto
even
unsolicite
,
she
could
not
appeal
to
his
love
,
nor
under
such
circumstance
could
she
allow
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
when
so
provoke
he
would
declare
his
passion
;
that
be
to
be
expect
;
there
have
be
enough
between
them
to
make
such
a
fact
sure
;
but
it
be
equally
certain
that
he
must
be
reject
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
understand
as
say
,
make
my
father
free
<EOS>
and
I
be
the
reward
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
no
sacrifice
in
that
;
 
not
so
have
Jephthah
's
daughter
save
her
father
;
 
not
so
could
she
show
to
that
kindest
,
dearest
of
parent
<EOS>
how
much
she
be
able
to
bear
for
his
good
.
<EOS>
no
;
to
one
resolve
must
her
whole
soul
be
bind
;
and
so
resolve
<EOS>
,
she
feel
that
she
could
make
her
great
request
to
Bold
with
as
much
self
-
assure
confidence
as
she
could
have
do
to
his
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
fear
for
my
heroine
;
not
as
to
the
upshot
of
her
mission
,
 
not
in
the
least
as
to
that
;
as
to
the
full
success
of
her
generous
scheme
,
and
the
ultimate
result
of
such
a
project
,
no
one
conversant
with
human
nature
and
novel
can
have
a
doubt
;
but
as
to
the
amount
of
sympathy
she
may
receive
from
those
of
her
own
sex
.
<EOS>
girl
below
twenty
and
old
lady
above
sixty
will
do
her
justice
;
for
in
the
female
heart
the
soft
spring
of
sweet
romance
reopen
after
many
year
,
and
again
gush
out
with
water
pure
as
in
early
day
,
and
greatly
refresh
the
path
that
lead
downwards
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
but
I
fear
that
the
majority
of
those
between
these
two
era
will
not
approve
of
Eleanor
's
plan
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
unmarried
lady
of
thirty
-
five
will
declare
that
there
can
be
no
probability
of
so
absurd
a
project
be
carry
through
;
that
young
woman
on
their
knee
before
their
lover
be
sure
to
get
kiss
,
and
that
they
would
not
put
themselves
in
such
a
position
<EOS>
do
they
not
expect
it
;
that
Eleanor
be
go
to
Bold
only
because
circumstance
prevent
bold
from
come
to
her
;
that
she
be
certainly
a
little
fool
,
or
a
little
schemer
,
but
that
in
all
probability
she
be
think
a
good
deal
more
about
herself
than
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
dear
lady
,
you
be
right
as
to
your
appreciation
of
the
circumstance
,
but
very
wrong
as
to
Miss
Harding
's
character
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harding
be
much
young
than
you
be
,
and
could
not
,
therefore
,
know
,
as
you
may
do
,
to
what
danger
such
an
encounter
may
expose
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
get
kiss
;
I
think
it
very
probable
that
she
will
;
but
I
give
my
solemn
word
and
positive
assurance
,
that
the
remote
idea
of
such
a
catastrophe
never
occur
to
her
as
she
make
the
great
resolve
now
allude
to
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
sleep
;
and
then
she
rise
refresh
;
and
meet
her
father
with
her
kind
embrace
and
most
loving
smile
;
and
on
the
whole
their
breakfast
be
by
no
means
so
triste
as
have
be
their
dinner
the
day
before
;
and
then
,
make
some
excuse
to
her
father
for
so
soon
leave
him
,
she
start
on
the
commencement
of
her
operation
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
that
John
Bold
be
in
London
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
the
scene
itself
could
not
be
enact
to
-
day
;
but
she
also
know
that
he
be
soon
to
be
home
,
probably
on
the
next
day
,
and
it
be
necessary
that
some
little
plan
for
meet
him
should
be
concert
with
his
sister
Mary
.
<EOS>
when
she
get
up
to
the
house
,
she
go
,
as
usual
,
into
the
morning
sit
-
room
,
and
be
startle
by
perceive
,
by
a
stick
,
a
greatcoat
,
and
sundry
parcel
which
be
lie
about
,
that
Bold
must
already
have
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
have
come
back
so
suddenly
,
"
say
Mary
,
come
into
the
room
;
"
he
have
be
travel
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
come
up
again
some
other
time
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
about
to
beat
a
retreat
in
her
sudden
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
out
now
,
and
will
be
for
the
next
two
hour
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
he
be
with
that
horrid
Finney

he
only
come
to

him
,

return

mail
train
tonight

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
return
by
the
mail
train
tonight
,
think
Eleanor
to
herself
,
as
she
strove
to
screw
up
her
courage
;
 
away
again
tonight
;
 
then
it
must
be
now
or
never
;
and
she
again
sit
down
,
have
rise
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
wish
the
ordeal
could
have
be
postpone
:
she
have
fully
make
up
her
mind
to
do
the
deed
,
but
she
have
not
make
up
her
mind
to
do
it
this
very
day
;
and
now
she
feel
ill
at
ease
,
astray
,
and
in
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
she
begin
,
"
I
must
see
your
brother
before
he
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
of
course
,
"
say
the
other
;
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
;
"
and
she
try
to
treat
it
as
a
matter
of
course
,
but
she
be
not
the
less
surprised
;
for
Mary
and
Eleanor
have
daily
talk
over
John
Bold
and
his
conduct
,
and
his
love
,
and
Mary
would
insist
on
call
Eleanor
her
sister
,
and
would
scold
her
for
not
call
Bold
by
his
christian
name
;
and
Eleanor
would
half
confess
her
love
,
but
like
a
modest
maiden
would
protest
against
such
familiarity
even
with
the
name
of
her
lover
;
and
so
they
talk
hour
after
hour
,
and
Mary
Bold
,
who
be
much
the
elder
,
look
forward
with
happy
confidence
to
the
day
when
Eleanor
would
not
be
ashamed
to
call
her
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
fully
sure
that
just
at
present
Eleanor
would
be
much
more
likely
to
avoid
her
brother
than
to
seek
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
I
must
see
your
brother
,
now
,
to
-
day
,
and
beg
from
him
a
great
favour
;
"
and
she
speak
with
a
solemn
air
,
not
at
all
usual
to
her
;
and
then
she
go
on
,
and
open
to
her
friend
all
her
plan
,
her
well
-
weigh
scheme
for
save
her
father
from
a
sorrow
which
would
,
she
say
,
if
it
last
,
bring
him
to
his
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
Mary
,
"
she
continue
,
<EOS>
"
you
must
now
,
you
know
,
cease
any
joking
about
me
and
Mr
Bold
;
you
must
now
say
no
more
about
that
;
I
be
not
ashamed
to
beg
this
favour
from
your
brother
,
but
when
I
have
do
so
,
there
can
never
be
anything
further
between
us
;
"
and
this
she
say
with
a
staid
and
solemn
air
,
quite
worthy
of
Jephthah
's
daughter
or
of
Iphigenia
either
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
that
Mary
Bold
do
not
follow
the
argument
.
<EOS>
that
Eleanor
Harding
should
appeal
,
on
behalf
of
her
father
,
to
Bold
's
well
feeling
seem
to
Mary
quite
natural
;
it
seem
quite
natural
that
he
should
relent
,
overcome
by
such
filial
tear
,
and
by
so
much
beauty
;
but
,
to
her
thinking
,
it
be
at
any
rate
equally
natural
,
that
have
relent
,
John
should
put
his
arm
round
his
mistress
's
waist
,
and
say
:
"
now
have
settle
that
,
let
us
be
man
and
wife
,
and
all
will
end
happily
!
"
<EOS>
why
his
good
nature
should
not
be
reward
,
when
such
reward
would
operate
to
the
disadvantage
of
none
,
Mary
,
who
have
more
sense
than
romance
,
could
not
understand
;
and
she
say
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
be
firm
,
and
make
quite
an
eloquent
speech
to
support
her
own
view
of
the
question
:
she
could
not
condescend
,
she
say
,
to
ask
such
a
favour
on
any
other
term
than
those
propose
.
<EOS>
Mary
may
,
perhaps
,
think
her
high
-
fly
,
but
she
have
her
own
idea
,
and
she
could
not
submit
to
sacrifice
her
self
-
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
sure
you
love
him
;
 
do
not
you
?
"
plead
Mary
;
"
and
I
be
sure
he
love
you
better
than
anything
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
go
to
make
another
speech
,
but
a
tear
come
to
each
eye
,
and
she
could
not
;
so
she
pretend
to
blow
her
nose
,
and
walk
to
the
window
,
and
make
a
little
inward
call
on
her
own
courage
,
and
find
herself
somewhat
sustain
,
say
sententiously
:
"
Mary
,
this
be
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
love
him
,
"
say
Mary
,
who
have
follow
her
friend
to
the
window
,
and
now
speak
with
her
arm
close
wound
round
the
other
's
waist
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
love
him
with
all
your
heart
,
 
you
know
you
do
;
I
defy
you
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
 
"
commence
Eleanor
,
turn
sharply
round
to
refute
the
charge
;
but
the
intend
falsehood
stick
in
her
throat
,
and
never
come
to
utterance
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
deny
her
love
,
so
she
take
plentifully
to
tear
,
and
leant
upon
her
friend
's
bosom
and
sob
there
,
and
protest
that
,
love
or
no
love
,
it
would
make
no
difference
in
her
resolve
,
and
call
Mary
,
a
thousand
time
,
the
most
cruel
of
girl
,
and
swear
her
to
secrecy
by
a
hundred
oath
,
and
end
by
declare
that
the
girl
who
could
betray
her
friend
's
love
,
even
to
a
brother
,
would
be
as
black
a
traitor
as
a
soldier
in
a
garrison
who
should
open
the
city
gate
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
yet
discuss
the
matter
,
Bold
return
,
and
Eleanor
be
force
into
sudden
action
:
she
have
either
to
accomplish
or
abandon
her
plan
;
and
have
slip
into
her
friend
's
bedroom
,
as
the
gentleman
close
the
hall
door
,
she
wash
the
mark
of
tear
from
her
eye
,
and
resolve
within
herself
to
go
through
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
tell
him
I
be
here
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
come
in
;
and
mind
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
leave
us
.
"
<EOS>
so
Mary
inform
her
brother
,
with
a
somewhat
sombre
air
,
that
Miss
Harding
be
in
the
next
room
,
and
be
come
to
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
certainly
think
more
of
her
father
than
herself
,
as
she
arrange
her
hair
before
the
glass
,
and
remove
the
trace
of
sorrow
from
her
face
;
and
yet
I
should
be
untrue
if
I
say
that
she
be
not
anxious
to
appear
well
before
her
lover
<EOS>
:
why
else
be
she
so
sedulous
with
that
stubborn
curl
that
would
rebel
against
her
hand
,
and
smooth
so
eagerly
her
ruffle
riband
?
<EOS>
why
else
do
she
damp
her
eye
to
dispel
the
redness
,
and
bite
her
pretty
lip
to
bring
back
the
colour
?
<EOS>
of
course
she
be
anxious
to
look
her
good
,
for
she
be
but
a
mortal
angel
after
all
.
<EOS>
but
have
she
be
immortal
,
have
she
flit
back
to
the
sitting
-
room
on
a
cherub
's
wing
,
she
could
not
have
have
a
more
faithful
heart
,
or
a
true
wish
to
save
her
father
at
any
cost
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
have
not
meet
her
since
the
day
when
she
leave
him
in
dudgeon
in
the
cathedral
close
.
<EOS>
since
then
his
whole
time
have
be
occupy
in
promote
the
cause
against
her
father
,
and
not
unsuccessfully
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
think
of
her
,
and
turn
over
in
his
mind
a
hundred
scheme
for
show
her
how
disintereste
be
his
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
write
to
her
and
beseech
her
not
to
allow
the
performance
of
a
public
duty
to
injure
him
in
her
estimation
;
he
would
write
to
Mr
Harding
,
explain
all
his
view
,
and
boldly
claim
the
warden
's
daughter
,
urge
that
the
untoward
circumstance
between
them
nee
be
no
bar
to
their
ancient
friendship
,
or
to
a
close
tie
;
he
would
throw
himself
on
his
knee
before
his
mistress
;
he
would
wait
and
marry
the
daughter
when
the
father
have
lose
his
home
and
his
income
;
he
would
give
up
the
lawsuit
and
go
to
Australia
,
with
her
of
course
,
leave
_
the
Jupiter
_
and
Mr
Finney
to
complete
the
case
between
them
.
<EOS>
sometimes
as
he
wake
in
the
morning
fevered
and
impatient
,
he
would
blow
out
his
brain
and
have
do
with
all
his
care
;
 
but
this
idea
be
generally
consequent
on
an
imprudent
supper
enjoy
in
company
with
Tom
Towers
.
  
<EOS>
how
beautiful
Eleanor
appear
to
him
as
she
slowly
walk
into
the
room
!
<EOS>
not
for
nothing
have
all
those
little
care
be
take
.
<EOS>
though
her
sister
,
the
archdeacon
's
wife
,
have
speak
slightingly
of
her
charm
,
Eleanor
be
very
beautiful
when
see
aright
.
<EOS>
her
be
not
of
those
impassive
face
,
which
have
the
beauty
of
a
marble
bust
;
finely
chisel
feature
,
perfect
in
every
line
,
true
to
the
rule
of
symmetry
,
as
lovely
to
a
stranger
as
to
a
friend
,
unvarye
unless
in
sickness
,
or
as
age
affect
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
startling
brilliancy
of
beauty
,
no
pearly
whiteness
,
no
radiant
carnation
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
the
majestic
contour
that
rivet
attention
,
demand
instant
wonder
,
and
then
disappoint
by
the
coldness
of
its
charm
.
<EOS>
You
may
pass
Eleanor
Harding
in
the
street
without
notice
,
but
you
could
hardly
pass
an
evening
with
her
and
not
lose
your
heart
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
never
appear
more
lovely
to
her
lover
than
she
now
do
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
animate
though
it
be
serious
,
and
her
full
dark
lustrous
eye
shine
with
anxious
energy
;
her
hand
tremble
as
she
take
his
,
and
she
could
hardly
pronounce
his
name
,
when
she
address
him
.
<EOS>
Bold
wish
with
all
his
heart
that
the
australian
scheme
be
in
the
act
of
realisation
,
and
that
he
and
Eleanor
be
away
together
,
never
to
hear
further
of
the
lawsuit
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
talk
,
ask
after
her
health
,
 
say
something
about
London
be
very
stupid
,
and
more
about
Barchester
be
very
pleasant
;
declare
the
weather
to
be
very
hot
,
and
then
inquire
after
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
be
not
very
well
,
"
say
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
be
very
sorry
,
 
so
sorry
:
<EOS>
he
hope
it
be
nothing
serious
,
and
put
on
the
unmeaningly
solemn
face
which
people
usually
use
on
such
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
especially
want
to
speak
to
you
about
my
father
,
Mr
Bold

indeed
,
I
be
now
here
on
purpose
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
papa
be
very
unhappy
,
very
unhappy
indeed
,
about
this
affair
of
the
hospital

you
would
pity
him

Mr
Bold
,
if
you
could
see
how
wretched
it

make
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

Miss
Harding
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
would
;
 
anyone
would
pity
him

but
a
friend

an
old
friend
as
you
be

indeed
you
would

<EOS>
He
be
an
altered
man
;
his
cheerfulness
have
all
go
,
and
his
sweet
temper

his
kind
happy

you
would
hardly

him

you
see
him

Mr

he
be
so
much
alter

and
 
if
this
go
on

he
will
die

"
<EOS>
here
Eleanor
have
recourse
to
her
handkerchief
,
and
so
also
have
her
auditor
;
but
she
pluck
up
her
courage
,
and
go
on
with
her
tale

"
<EOS>
He
will
break
his
heart

die

<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
Mr
Bold
,
it
be
not
you
who
write
those
cruel
thing
in
the
newspaper

<EOS>
John
Bold
eagerly
protest
that
it
be
not

but
his
heart
smite
him
as
to
his
intimate
alliance
with
Tom
Towers

<EOS>
"
no

I
be
sure
it
be
not

papa

not

think
so

you
would
not
be
so
cruel

but
it
have
nearly
kill
him

<EOS>
Papa
can
not
bear
to
think
that
people
should
so
speak
of
him
,
and
that
everybody
should
hear
him
so
spoken
of

they
have
call
him
avaricious
,
and
dishonest
,
and
they
say
he
be
rob
the

take
the
money

nothing

continue
Eleanor

interrupt
him

tide

her
eloquence

no

if

<EOS>
both
her
auditor

brother

assent
to
this

declare
on
their

I

unjustly

<EOS>
do
you
know
he
would
give
up
the
hospital
altogether

only
he

not

<EOS>
the
archdeacon
say
it
would
be
cowardly

that
he
would
be
desert
his
order

injure
the

<EOS>
whatever
may
happen

papa
will
not

he

all

she
stop

It

say
an
unkind
word
!
"
<EOS>
and
here
she
break
down
,
and
the
violence
of
her
sobs
stop
her
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
,
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
,
declare
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
friend
impute
any
blame
personally
to
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
should
he
be
persecute
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Eleanor
through
her
tear
,
forget
in
her
eagerness
that
her
intention
have
be
to
humble
herself
as
a
suppliant
before
John
Bold
;
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
he
be
single
out
for
scorn
and
disgrace
?
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
make
so
wretched
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
"
 
and
she
turn
towards
him
as
though
the
kneel
scene
be
about
to
be
commence
,
 
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
why
do
you
begin
all
this
?
<EOS>
You
,
whom
we
all
<EOS>
so
 
so
 
value
!
"
  
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
,
the
reformer
's
punishment
be
certainly
come
upon
him
,
for
his
present
plight
be
not
enviable
;
he
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
excuse
himself
by
platitude
about
public
duty
,
which
it
be
by
no
means
worth
while
to
repeat
,
and
to
reiterate
his
eulogy
on
Mr
Harding
's
character
.
<EOS>
His
position
be
certainly
a
cruel
one
:
have
any
gentleman
call
upon
him
on
behalf
of
Mr
Harding
he
could
of
course
have
decline
to
enter
upon
the
subject
;
but
how
could
he
do
so
with
a
beautiful
girl
,
with
the
daughter
of
the
man
whom
he
have
injure
,
with
his
own
love
?
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Eleanor
recollect
herself
,
and
again
summon
up
her
energy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
come
here
to
implore
you
to
abandon
this
proceeding
.
"
<EOS>
He
stand
up
from
his
seat
,
and
look
beyond
measure
distressed
.
<EOS>
"
to
implore
you
to
abandon
it
,
to
implore
you
to
spare
my
father
,
to
spare
either
his
life
or
his
reason
,
for
one
or
the
other
will
pay
the
forfeit
if
this
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
much
I
be
ask
,
and
how
little
right
I
have
to
ask
anything
;
but
I
think
you
will
listen
to
me
as
it
be
for
my
father
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Bold
,
pray
,
pray
do
this
for
us
;
 
pray
<EOS>
do
not
drive
to
distraction
a
man
who
have
love
you
so
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
absolutely
kneel
to
him
,
but
she
follow
him
as
he
move
from
his
chair
,
and
lay
her
soft
hand
imploringly
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
at
any
other
time
how
exquisitely
valuable
would
have
be
that
touch
!
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
distraught
,
dumbfound
,
and
unmanned
.
<EOS>
what
could
he
say
to
that
sweet
suppliant
;
how
explain
to
her
that
the
matter
now
be
probably
beyond
his
control
;
how
tell
her
that
he
could
not
quell
the
storm
which
he
have
raise
?
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
surely
,
John
,
you
can
not
refuse
her

his
sister

<EOS>
"
I
would
give

my
soul

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
say
Eleanor
,
"
do
not
speak
so
<EOS>
;
I
ask
nothing
for
myself

what
I
ask
for

not

you

<EOS>
"
I
would

Bold
,
still
address
his

everything
I

every

be
centre
in

when
I
see
her
in
sorrow

she
now
be

"
no

no

no

ejaculate
Eleanor
;

there
can

seize
him
by
his

she
follow
him
across
the
room
towards
the
door

I

kneel

You

you

and
she
cling
to
him
with
fix
tenacity
,
and
reiterate
her
resolve
with
hysterical
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
speak
to
her
,
John
;
answer
her
,
"
say
Mary
,
bewilder
by
the
unexpected
vehemence
of

manner
;
"
you
can
not

the
cruelty

refuse
her

"
  
<EOS>
"

promise
me

Eleanor
;
"
say
that
my

safe

will
do

how
true
you

one
word

I
will
let
you
go

"
  
<EOS>
She
still
hold
him
,
and
look
eagerly
into
his
face
,
with
her
hair
dishevel
and
her
eye
all
bloodshot
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
thought
now
of
herself
,
no
care
now
for
her
appearance
;
and
yet
he
think
he
have
never
see
her
half
<EOS>
so
lovely
;
he
be
amazed
at
the
intensity
of
her
beauty
,
and
could
hardly
believe
that
it
be
she
whom
he
have
dare
to
love
.
"
<EOS>
promise
me
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
will
not
leave
you
till
you
have
promise
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will

"
say
he
at
length
;
"
I
do
 
all
I
can
do
,
I
will
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
may
God
Almighty
bless
you
for
ever

ever
!
"
<EOS>
say
Eleanor
;
and
fall
on
her
knee
with
her
face
in
Mary
's
lap
,
she
weep
and
sob
like
a
child
:
<EOS>
her
strength
have
carry
her
through
her
allotted
task
,
but
now
it
be
well
nigh
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
while
she
be
partly
recover
,
and
get
up
to
go
,
and
would
have
go
,
have
not
Bold
make
her
understand
that
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
explain
to
her
how
far
it
be
in
his
power
to
put
an
end
to
the
proceeding
which
have
be
take
against
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
have
he
speak
on
any
other
subject
,
she
would
have
vanish
,
but
on
that
she
be
bind
to
hear
him
;
and
now
the
danger
of
her
position
commence
.
<EOS>
while
she
have
an
active
part
to
play
,
while
she
cling
to
him
as
a
suppliant
,
it
be
easy
enough
for
her
to
reject
his
proffer
love
,
and
cast
from
her
his
caressing
word
;
but
now
 
now
that
he
have
yield
,
and
be
talk
to
her
calmly
and
kindly
as
to
her
father
's
welfare
,
it
be
hard
enough
for
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
then
Mary
Bold
assist
her
;
but
now
she
be
quite
on
her
brother
's
side
.
<EOS>
Mary
say
but
little
,
but
every
word
she
do
say
give
some
direct
and
deadly
blow
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
she
do
be
to
make
room
for
her
brother
between
herself
and
Eleanor
on
the
sofa
:
as
the
sofa
be
full
large
for
three
,
Eleanor
could
not
resent
this
,
nor
could
she
show
suspicion
by
take
another
seat
;
but
she
feel
it
to
be
a
most
unkind
proceeding
.
<EOS>
and
then
Mary
would
talk
as
though
they
three
be
join
in
some
close
peculiar
bond
together
;
as
though
they
be
in
future
always
to
wish
together
,
contrive
together
,
and
act
together
;
and
Eleanor
could
not
gainsay
this
;
she
could
not
make
another
speech
,
and
say
,
"
Mr
Bold
and
I
be
stranger
,
Mary
,
and
be
always
to
remain
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
explain
to
her
that
,
though
undoubtedly
the
proceeding
against
the
hospital
have
commence
solely
with
himself
,
many
other
be
now
interested
in
the
matter
,
some
of
whom
be
much
more
influential
than
himself
;
that
it
be
to
him
alone
,
however
,
that
the
lawyer
look
for
instruction
as
to
their
doing
,
and
,
more
important
still
,
for
the
payment
of
their
bill
;
and
he
promise
that
he
would
at
once
give
them
notice
that
it
be
his
intention
to
abandon
the
cause
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
he
say
,
that
it
be
not
probable
that
any
active
step
would
be
take
after
he
have
secede
from
the
matter
,
though
it
be
possible
that
some
pass
allusion
may
still
be
make
to
the
hospital
in
the
daily
_
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
He
promise
,
however
,
that
he
would
use
his
good
influence
to
prevent
any
further
personal
allusion
be
make
to
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
then
suggest
that
he
would
on
that
afternoon
ride
over
himself
to
Dr
grantly
,
and
inform
him
of
his
altered
intention
on
the
subject
,
and
with
this
view
,
he
postpone
his
immediate
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
pleasant
,
and
Eleanor
do
enjoy
a
sort
of
triumph
in
the
feeling
that
she
have
attain
the
object
for
which
she
have
seek
this
interview
;
but
still
the
part
of
Iphigenia
be
to
be
play
out
.
<EOS>
the
god
have
hear
her
prayer
,
grant
her
request
,
and
be
they
not
to
have
their
promise
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
not
a
girl
to
defraud
them
wilfully
;
so
,
as
soon
as
she
decently
could
,
she
get
up
for
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
so
soon
?
"
say
Bold
,
who
half
an
hour
since
would
have
give
a
hundred
pound
that
he
be
in
London
,
and
she
still
at
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
much
oblige
to
you
;
papa
will
feel
this
to
be
so
kind
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
quite
appreciate
all
her
father
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
must
tell
him
,
and
I
will
say
that
you
will
see
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
may
I
not
say
one
word
for
myself
?
"
say
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
you
your
bonnet
,
Eleanor
,
"
say
Mary
,
in
the
act
of
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
Mary
,
"
say
she
,
get
up
and
catch
her
by
her
dress
;
"
do
not
go
,
I
will
get
my
bonnet
myself
.
"
<EOS>
but
Mary
,
the
traitress
,
stand
fast
by
the
door
,
and
permit
no
such
retreat
.
<EOS>
poor
Iphigenia
!
  
<EOS>
and
with
a
volley
of
impassioned
love
,
John
Bold
pour
forth
the
feeling
of
his
heart
,
swear
,
as
man
do
,
some
truth
and
many
falsehood
;
and
Eleanor
repeat
with
every
shade
of
vehemence
<EOS>
the
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
which
have
have
a
short
time
since
so
much
effect
;
but
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
its
strength
be
go
.
<EOS>
let
her
be
never
so
vehement
,
her
vehemence
be
not
respect
;
all
her
"
no
,
no
,
no
's
"
be
meet
with
counter
-
asseveration
,
and
at
last
be
overpower
.
<EOS>
the
ground
be
cut
from
under
her
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
She
be
press
to
say
whether
her
father
would
object
;
whether
she
herself
have
any
aversion
(
aversion
!
<EOS>
God
help
her
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
the
word
nearly
make
her
jump
into
his
arm
)
;
any
other
preference
(
this
she
loudly
disclaim
)
;
whether
it
be
impossible
that
she
should
love
him
(
Eleanor
could
not
say
that
it
be
impossible
)
:
and
so
at
last
all
her
defence
demolish
,
all
her
maiden
barrier
sweep
away
,
she
capitulate
,
or
rather
march
out
with
the
honour
of
war
,
vanquish
evidently
,
palpably
vanquish
,
but
still
not
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
confess
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
altar
on
the
shore
of
the
modern
Aulis
reek
with
no
sacrifice
.
   
<EOS>
MR
BOLD
's
visit
to
plumstead
 
<EOS>
whether
or
no
the
ill
-
natured
prediction
make
by
certain
lady
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
be
or
be
not
carry
out
to
the
letter
,
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
state
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
certainly
do
feel
herself
to
have
be
baffle
as
she
return
home
with
all
her
news
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
certainly
she
have
be
victorious
,
certainly
she
have
achieve
her
object
,
certainly
she
be
not
unhappy
,
and
yet
she
do
not
feel
herself
triumphant
.
<EOS>
everything
would
run
smooth
now
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
be
not
at
all
addict
to
the
lydian
school
of
romance
;
she
by
no
means
object
to
her
lover
because
he
come
in
at
the
door
under
the
name
of
Absolute
,
instead
of
pull
her
out
of
a
window
under
the
name
of
Beverley
;
and
yet
she
feel
that
she
have
be
impose
upon
,
and
could
hardly
think
of
Mary
Bold
with
sisterly
charity
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
I
could
have
trust
Mary
,
"
she
say
to
herself
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
"
oh
that
she
should
have
dare
to
keep
me
in
the
room
when
I
try
to
get
out
!
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
feel
that
the
game
be
up
,
and
that
she
have
now
nothing
further
to
do
but
to
add
to
the
budget
of
news
which
be
prepare
for
her
father
,
that
John
Bold
be
her
accept
lover
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
,
however
,
now
leave
her
on
her
way
,
and
go
with
John
Bold
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
merely
premise
that
Eleanor
on
reach
home
will
not
find
thing
so
smooth
as
she
fondly
expect
;
two
messenger
have
come
,
one
to
her
father
and
the
other
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
each
of
them
much
oppose
to
her
quiet
mode
of
solve
all
their
difficulty
;
the
one
in
the
shape
of
a
number
of
_
the

<EOS>
John
Bold
get
on
his
horse
and
ride
off
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
not
briskly
and
with
eager
spur
,
as
man
do
ride
when
self
-
satisfied
with
their
own
intention
;
but
slowly
,
modestly
,
thoughtfully
,
and
somewhat
in
dread
of
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
now
and
again
he
would
recur
to
the
scene
which
be
just
over
,
support
himself
by
the
remembrance
of
the
silence
that
give
consent
,
and
exult
as
a
happy
lover
.
<EOS>
but
even
this
feeling
be
not
without
a
shade
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
show
himself
childishly
weak
thus
to
yield
up
the
resolve
of
many
hour
of
thought
to
the
tear
of
a
pretty
girl
?
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
meet
his
lawyer
?
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
back
out
of
a
matter
in
which
his
name
be
already
so
publicly
concerned
?
<EOS>
what
,
<EOS>
oh
what
!
<EOS>
be
he
to
say
to
Tom
Towers
?
<EOS>
while
meditate
these
painful
thing
he
reach
the
lodge
lead
up
to
the
archdeacon
's
glebe
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
find
himself
within
the
sacred
precinct
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
doctor
's
child
be
together
on
the
slope
of
the
lawn
,
close
to
the
road
,
as
Bold
ride
up
to
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
They
be
there
hold
high
debate
on
matter
evidently
of
deep
interest
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
the
voice
of
the
boy
have
be
hear
before
the
lodge
gate
be
closed
.
  
<EOS>
Florinda
and
Grizzel
,
frighten
at
the
sight
of
so
well
-
know
an
enemy
to
the
family
,
flee
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
horseman
,
and
run
in
terror
to
their
mother
's
arm
;
not
for
them
be
it
,
tender
branch
,
to
resent
injury
,
or
as
member
of
a
church
militant
to
put
on
armour
against
its
enemy
.
<EOS>
but
the
boy
stand
their
ground
like
hero
,
and
boldly
demand
the
business
of
the
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
see
anybody
here
,
sir
?
"
say
Henry
,
with
a
defiant
eye
and
a
hostile
tone
,
which
plainly
say
that
at
any
rate
no
one
there
want
to
see
the
person
so
addressed
;
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
brandish
aloft
his
garden
water
-
pot
,
hold
it
by
the
spout
,
ready
for
the
braining
of
anyone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
"
say
Charles
James
slowly
,
and
with
a
certain
dignity
of
diction
,
"
Mr
Bold
of
course
would
not
have
come
without
want
to
see
someone
;
if
Mr
Bold
have
a
proper
ground
for

to
see
some
person
here
,
of
course
he
have
a
right

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Samuel
step
lightly
up
to
the
horse
's
head
,
and
offer
his
service
.
<EOS>
"
oh

Mr
Bold

"
say
he
,
"
papa

I
be
sure
,
will
be
glad

I
suppose
you
want

<EOS>
Shall
I
hold
your
horse
for
you
?
<EOS>
oh
what
a
very
pretty
horse
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
he
turn
his
head
and
wink
funnily
at
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
have
hear
such
good
news
about
the
old
hospital
to

day

<EOS>
We
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
it

because
you
be
such
a

of

Harding

and
so
much

<EOS>
"
how
d'ye
do

lad

"
say
Bold
,
dismount
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
your

he
be
at
home

"
  
<EOS>
"
Lads
!
<EOS>
"
say
Henry
,
turn
on
his
heel
and
address
himself
to
his
brother
,
but
loud
enough
to
be
hear
by
Bold
;
"
lad
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
if
we
be
lad
,
what
do
he
call
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
James
condescend
to
say
nothing
further
,
but
cock
his
hat
with
much
precision
,
and
leave
the
visitor
to
the
care
of
his
young
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Samuel
stay
till
the
servant
come
,
chatting
and
pat
the
horse
;
but
as
soon
as
Bold
have
disappear
through
the
front
door
,
he
stick
a
switch
under
the
animal
's
tail
to
make
him
kick
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
the
church
reformer
soon
find
himself
_

with
the
archdeacon
in
that
same
room
,
in
that
sanctum
sanctorum
of
the
rectory
,
to
which
we
have
already
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
as
he
enter
he
hear
the
click
of
a
certain
patent
lock
,
but
it
strike
him
with
no
surprise
;
the
worthy
clergyman
be
no
doubt
hide
from
eye
profane
<EOS>
his
last
much

sermon
;
for
the
archdeacon
,
though
he
preach
but
seldom

be
famous
for
his
sermon
.
<EOS>
no
room
,
bold
think
,
could
have
be
more
become
for
a
dignitary
of
the
church
;
each
wall
be
load
with
theology
;
over
each
separate
bookcase
be
print
in
small
gold
letter
the
name
of
those
great
divine
whose
work
be
range
beneath
:
begin
from
the
early
father
in
due
chronological
order
<EOS>
,
there
be
to
be
find
the
precious
labour
of
the
choose
servant
of
the
church
down
to
the
last
pamphlet
write
in
opposition
to
the
consecration
of
Dr
Hampden
;
and
raise
above
this
be
to
be
see
the
bust
of
the
great

the

<EOS>
chrysostom
,
St
Augustine
,
Thomas

Becket
,
Cardinal
Wolsey
,
Archbishop
Laud
,
and
Dr
Philpotts
.
  
<EOS>
every
appliance
that
could
make
study
pleasant
and
give
ease
to
the

brain
be
there
;
chair
make
to
relieve
each
limb
and
muscle
;
reading
-
desk
and
writing

desk
to
suit
every
attitude
;
lamp
and
candle
mechanically
contrive
to
throw
their
light
on
any
favour
spot
,
as
the

may
desire
;
a
shoal
of
newspaper
to
amuse
the
few
leisure
moment
which
may
be
steal
from
the
labour
of
the
day
;
and
then
from
the
window
a
view
right
through
a
bosky
vista
along
which
run
a
broad
green
path
from
the
rectory
to
the
church
,
 
at
the
end
of
which
the
tawny
-
tint
fine
old
tower
be
see
with
all
its
variegate
pinnacle
and
parapet
.
<EOS>
few
parish
church
in
England
be
in
well
repair
,
or
better
worth
keep
so
,
than
that
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
and
yet
it
be
build
in
a
faulty
style
<EOS>
:
the
body
of
the
church
be
low
,
 
so
low
,
that
the
nearly
flat
leaden
roof
would
be
visible
from
the
churchyard
,
be
it
not
for
the
carve
parapet
with
which
it
be
surround
.
<EOS>
It
be
cruciform
,
though
the
transept
be
irregular
,
one
be
large
than
the
other
;
and
the
tower
be
much
too
high
in
proportion
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
but
the
colour
of
the
building
be
perfect
;
it
be
that
rich
yellow
gray
which
one
find
nowhere
but
in
the
south
and
west
of
England
,
and
which
be
so
strong
a
characteristic
of
most
of
our
old
house
of
Tudor
architecture
.
<EOS>
the
stone
work
also
be
beautiful
;
the
mullion
of
the
window
and
the
thick
tracery
of
the
gothic
workmanship
be
as
rich
as
fancy
can
desire
;
and
though
in
gaze
on
such
a
structure
<EOS>
one
know
by
rule
that
the
old
priest
who
build
it
,
build
it
wrong
,
one
can
not
bring
oneself
to
wish
that
they
should
have
make
it
other
than
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
when
Bold
be
usher
into
the
book
-
room
,
he
find
its
owner
stand
with
his
back
to
the
empty
fire
-
place
ready
to
receive
him
,
and
he
could
not
but
perceive
that
that
expansive
brow
be
elate
with
triumph
,
and
that
those
full
heavy
lip
bear
more
prominently
than
usual
an
appearance
of
arrogant
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
say
he
;
 
"
well

what
can
I
do
for
you

<EOS>
very
happy

<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
be
stand
himself
,
and
he
do
not
ask
Bold
to
sit

and
therefore
he
have
to
tell
his
tale
standing
,
lean
on
the
table
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
however

manage
to
tell
it
;
and
as
the
archdeacon
never

interrupt
him
,
or
even
encourage
him
by
a
single

he
be
not
long

so

Mr

I

I

there

<EOS>
"
well

well

we
will
not

I

would
so
call
an
endeavour
to
take
away
from
a
man
every
shilling
of
income
that
he
have
to

but
it
sha'n't
be

<EOS>
"
You
have
already
have
enough
of
it

well

I
can
not

that
I
be
surprised

on
a

have
nothing

very
red
in

You

however

that

I

that

safe

Mr

"
  
<EOS>
that
be
certainly
the
bitter
moment
in
John
Bold

life

<EOS>
not
even
the
remembrance
of
his
successful
love
could
comfort
him
;
nay
,
when
he
think
of
Eleanor
he
feel
that
it
be
that
very
love
which
have
bring
him
to
such
a
pass
.
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
be
so
insulted
,
and
be
unable
to
reply
!
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
give
up
so
much
to
the
request
of
a
girl
,
and
then
have
have
his
motive
so
misunderstood
!
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
make
so
gross
a
mistake
as
this
visit
of
his
to
the
archdeacon
's
!
<EOS>
He
bite
the
top
of
his
whip
,
till
he
penetrate
the
horn
of
which
it
be
make
:
he
strike
the
poor
animal
in
his
anger
,
and
then
be
doubly
angry
with
himself
at
his
futile
passion
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
so
completely
checkmate
,
so
palpably
overcome
!
<EOS>
and
what
be
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
continue
his
action
after
pledge
himself
to
abandon
it
;
nor
be
there
any
revenge
in
that
;
 
it
be
the
very
step
to
which
his
enemy
have
endeavour
to
goad
him
!
  
<EOS>
He
throw
the
rein
to
the
servant
who
come
to
take
his
horse
,
and
rush
upstairs
into
his
drawing
-
room
,
where
his
sister
Mary
be
sit
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
a
devil
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
real
devil
here
on
earth
,
it
be
Dr
grantly
.
"
<EOS>
He
vouchsafe
her
no
further
intelligence
,
but
again
seize
his
hat
,
he
rush
out
,
and
take
his
departure
for
London
without
another
word
to
anyone
.
   
<EOS>
the
warden
's
decision
 
<EOS>
the
meeting
between
Eleanor
and
her
father
be
not
so
stormy
as
that
describe
in
the
last
chapter
,
but
it
be
hardly
more
successful
.
<EOS>
on
her
return
from
Bold
's
house
she
find
her
father
in
a
strange
state
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
sorrowful
and
silent
as
he
have
be
on
that
memorable
day
when
his
son
-
in
-
law
lecture
him
as
to
all
that
he
owe
to
his
order
;
nor
be
he
in
his
usual
quiet
mood
.
<EOS>
when
Eleanor
reach
the
hospital
,
he
be
walk
to
and
fro
upon
the
lawn
,
and
she
soon
see
that
he
be
much
excited
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
London
,
my
dear
,
"
he
say
as
soon
as
he
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
London
,
papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
to
London
;
I
will
have
this
matter
settle
some
way
;
there
be
some
thing
,
Eleanor
,
which
I
can
not
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
,
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
lead
him
by
the
arm
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
such
good
news
for
you
,
and
now
you
make
me
fear
I
be
too
late
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
before
he
could
let
her
know
what
have
cause
this
sudden
resolve
,
or
could
point
to
the
fatal
paper
which
lie
on
the
table
,
she
tell
him
that
the
lawsuit
be
over
,
that
Bold
have
commission
her
to
assure
her
father
in
his
name
that
it
would
be
abandon
,
 
that
there
be
no
further
cause
for
misery
,
that
the
whole
matter
may
be
look
on
as
though
it
have
never
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
tell
him
with
what
determined
vehemence
she
have
obtain
this
concession
in
his
favour
,
nor
do
she
mention
the
price
she
be
to
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
warden
do
not
express
himself
peculiarly
gratify
at
this
intelligence
,
and
Eleanor
,
though
she
have
not
work
for
thank
,
and
be
by
no
means
dispose
to
magnify
her
own
good
office
,
feel
hurt
at
the
manner
in
which
her
news
be
receive
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
can
act
as
he
think
proper
,
my
love
,
"
say
he
;
"
if
Mr
Bold
think
he
have
be
wrong
,
of
course
he
will
discontinue
what
he
be
do
;
but
that
can
not
change
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
all
but
cry
with
vexation
;
"
I
think
you
would
have
be
so
happy
;
 
I
think
all
would
have
be
right
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bold
,
"
continue
he
,
"
have
set
great
people
to
work
,
 
so
great
that
I
doubt
they
be
now
beyond
his
control
.
<EOS>
read
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
warden
,
double
up
a
number
of
_
the
Jupiter
_
,
point
to
the
peculiar
article
which
she
be
to
read
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
the
last
of
the
three
leader
,
which
be
generally
furnish
daily
for
the
support
of
the
nation
,
that
Mr
Harding
direct
her
attention
.
<EOS>
It
deal
some
heavy
blow
on
various
clerical
delinquent
;
on
family
who
receive
their
ten
of
thousand
yearly
for
do
nothing
;
on
man
who
,
as
the
article
state
,
roll
in
wealth
which
they
have
neither
earn
nor
inherit
,
and
which
be
in
fact
steal
from
the
poor
clergy
.
<EOS>
It
name
some
son
of
bishop
,
and
grandson
of
archbishop
;
man
great
in
their
way
,
who
have
redeem
their
disgrace
in
the
eye
of
many
by
the
enormity
of
their
plunder
;
and
then
,
have
dispose
of
these
leviathan
,
it
descend
to
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
We
allude
some
week
since
to
an
instance
of
similar
injustice
,
though
in
a
more
humble
scale
,
in
which
the
warden
of
an
almshouse
at
Barchester
have
become
possess
of
the
income
of
the
great
part
of
the
whole
institution
.
<EOS>
why
an
almshouse
should
have
a
warden
we
can
not
pretend
to
explain
,
nor
can
we
say
what
special
need
twelve
old
man
can
have
for
the
service
of
a
separate
clergyman
,
see
that
they
have
twelve
reserve
seat
for
themselves
in
Barchester
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
but
be
this
as
it
may
,
let
the
gentleman
call
himself
warden
or
precentor
,
or
what
he
will
,
let
him
be
never
so
scrupulous
in
exact
religious
duty
from
his
twelve
dependent
,
or
never
so
negligent
as
regard
the
service
of
the
cathedral
,
it
appear
palpably
clear
that
he
can
be
entitle
to
no
portion
of
the
revenue
of
the
hospital
,
except
that
which
the
founder
set
apart
for
him
;
and
it
be
equally
clear
that
the
founder
do
not
intend
that
three
-
fifth
of
his
charity
should
be
so
consume
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
be
certainly
a
paltry
one
after
the
ten
of
thousand
with
which
we
have
be
deal
,
for
the
warden
's
income
be
after
all
but
a
poor
eight
hundred
a
year
:
eight
hundred
a
year
be
not
magnificent
preferment
of
itself
,
and
the
warden
may
,
for
anything
we
know
,
be
worth
much
more
to
the
church
;
but
if
so
,
let
the
church
pay
him
out
of
fund
justly
at
its
own
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
We
allude
to
the
question
of
the
Barchester
almshouse
at
the
present
moment
,
because
we
understand
that
a
plea
have
be
set
up
which
will
be
peculiarly
revolt
to
the
mind
of
english
churchman
.
<EOS>
an
action
have
be
take
against
Mr
Warden
Harding
,
on
behalf
of
the
almsmen
,
by
a
gentleman
act
solely
on
public
ground
,
and
it
be
to
be
argue
that
Mr
Harding
take
nothing
but
what
he
receive
as
a
servant
of
the
hospital
,
and
that
he
be
not
himself
responsible
for
the
amount
of
stipend
give
to
him
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
such
a
plea
would
doubtless
be
fair
,
if
anyone
question
the
daily
wage
of
a
bricklayer
employ
on
the
building
,
or
the
fee
of
the
charwoman
who
clean
it
;
but
we
can
not
envy
the
feeling
of
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
who
could
allow
such
an
argument
to
be
put
in
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
plea
be
put
forward
we
trust
Mr
Harding
will
be
force
as
a
witness
to
state
the
nature
of
his
employment
;
the
amount
of
work
that
he
do
;
the
income
which
he
receive
;
and
the
source
from
whence
he
obtain
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
think
he
will
receive
much
public
sympathy
to
atone
for
the
annoyance
of
such
an
examination
.
  
<EOS>
as
Eleanor
read
the
article
her
face
flush
with
indignation
,
and
when
she
have
finish
it
,
she
almost
fear
to
look
up
at
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
that
;
 
be
it
worth
while
to
be
a
warden
at
that
price
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
;
 
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bold
can
not

-
write
that
,

that
that
sha'n't
be
read
by
every

at
Oxford
;
nay
,
by
every
gentleman
in
the
land
;
"
and
then
he
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
while
Eleanor
in
mute
despair
follow
him
with
her
eye
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
,
"
he
continue
,
speak
now
very
calmly
,
and
in
a
forced
manner
very
unlike
himself
;
"
Mr
Bold
can
not
dispute
the
truth
of
every
word
in
that
article
you
have
just
read
 
nor
can

"
Eleanor
stare
at
him
,
as
though
she
scarcely
understand
the
word
he
be
speak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
can
I
,
Eleanor
:
that
be
the
bad
of
all
,
or
would
be
so
if
there
be
no
remedy
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
much
of
all
this
since
we
be
together
last
night
;
"
and
he
come
and
sit
beside
her
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
he
have
do
then
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
much
of
what
the
archdeacon
have
say
,
and
of
what
this
paper
say
;
and
I
do
believe
I
have
no
right
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
right
to
be
warden
of
the
hospital
,
papa
?
"
  
"
no
right
to
be
warden
with
eight
hundred
a
year
;
no
right
to
be
warden
with
such
a
house
as
this
;
no
right
to
spend
in
luxury
money
that
be
intend
for
charity
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
may
do
as
he
please
about
his
suit
,
but
I
hope
he
will
not
abandon
it
for
my
sake

<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
this
be
hard
upon
her
.
<EOS>
be
it
for
this
she
have
make
her
great
resolve
!
<EOS>
for
this
that
she
have
lay
aside
her
quiet
demeanour
,
and
take
upon
her
the
rant
of
a
tragedy
heroine
!
<EOS>
one
may
work
and
not
for
thank
,
but
yet
feel
hurt
at
not
receive
them
;
and
so
it
be
with
Eleanor
:
<EOS>
one
may
be
disintereste
in
one
's
good
action
,
and
yet
feel
discontented
that
they
be
not
recognise
.
<EOS>
charity
may
be
give
with
the
left
hand
so
privily
that
the
right
hand
do
not
know
it
,
and
yet
the
left
hand
may
regret
to
feel
that
it
have
no
immediate
reward
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
have
no
wish
to
burden
her
father
with
a
weight
of
obligation
,
and
yet
she
have
look
forward
to
much
delight
from
the
knowledge
that
she
have
free
him
from
his
sorrow
:
now
such
hope
be
entirely
over
:
<EOS>
all
that
she
have
do
be
of
no
avail
;
she
have
humble
herself
to
Bold
in
vain
;
the
evil
be
utterly
beyond
her
power
to
cure
!
  
<EOS>
She
have
think
also
how
gently
she
would
whisper
to
her
father
all
that
her
lover
have
say
to
her
about
herself
,
and

impossible
she
have
find
it
to
reject
him

and
then
she
have
anticipate
her
father

kindly
kiss
and
close
embrace
as
he
give
his
sanction
to
her
love
.
<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
she
could
say
nothing
of
this
now
.
<EOS>
in
speak
of
Mr
Bold
,
her
father
put
him
aside
as
one

<EOS>
gentle
reader

do
you
ever
feel
yourself
snub
?
<EOS>
do
you
ever
,
when
think
much
of
your
own
importance
,
find
yourself
suddenly
reduce
to
a
nonentity
?
<EOS>
such
be
Eleanor

feeling
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
They

not
put
forward
this
plea
on
my
behalf

"
continue
the
warden
.
<EOS>
"
whatever
may
be
the
truth
of
the
matter
,
that
at
any
rate
be
not
true
;
and
the
man
who
write
that
article
be
right
in
say
that
such
a
plea
be
revolt
to
an
honest
mind
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
up
to
London
,
my
dear
,
and
see
these
lawyer
myself
,
and
if
no
well
excuse
can
be
make
for
me

that

I
and
the

will
part

but
the
archdeacon

papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
my
dear
;
there
be
some
thing
which
a
man
can
not
bear
:
 
I
can
not
bear
that
;
"
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
will
the
archdeacon
go
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mr
Harding
have
make
up
his
mind
to
steal
a
march
upon
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
he
could
take
no
step
without
inform
his
dread
son
-
in
-
law
,
but
he
have
resolve
that
he
would
send
out
a
note
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
detail
his
plan
,
but
that
the
messenger
should
not
leave
Barchester
till
he
himself
have
start
for
London
;
so
that
he
may
be
a
day
before
the
doctor
,
who
,
he
have
no
doubt
,
would
follow
him
.
<EOS>
in
that
day
,
if
he
have
luck
,
he
may
arrange
it
all
;
he
may
explain
to
Sir
Abraham
that
he
,
as
warden
,
would
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
defence
about
to
be
set
up
;
he
may
send
in
his
official
resignation
to
his
friend
the
bishop
,
and
so
make
public
the
whole
transaction
,
that
even
the
doctor
would
not
be
able
to
undo
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
know
too
well
the
doctor
's
strength
and
his
own
weakness
to
suppose
he
could
do
this
,
if
they
both
reach
London
together
;
indeed
,
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
to
London
,
if
the
doctor
know
of
his
intend
journey
in
time
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
think
not
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
start
before
the
archdeacon
could
be
ready
;
 
I
shall
go
early
to

morrow
morning

my

<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
wish
to
do
all
this
before
the

can
 
can
interfere

<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
all
he
say
;
 
he
argue
very
well
,
and
I
can
not
always
answer
him
;
but
there
be
an
old
saying
,
nelly
:
"
everyone
know
where
his
own
shoe
pinche

"
<EOS>
He
will
say
that
I
want
moral
courage
,
and
strength
of
character
,
and
power
of
endurance
,
and
it
be
all
true
;
but
I
be
sure
I
ought
not
to
remain
here
,
if
I
have
nothing
well
to
put
forward
than
a
quibble
:
<EOS>
so

nelly

we

have

"

he

now
again
quite
happy

at
ease
in
his

It

the

It

all

it
be

<EOS>
this

Crabtree
Canonicorum

to
his
London
lodging

<EOS>
Ill
as
he
have
fare
in
his
interview
with
the
archdeacon
<EOS>
,
he
be
not
the
less
under
the
necessity
of
carry
out
his
pledge
to
Eleanor
;
and
he
go
about
his
ungracious
task
with
a
heavy
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
attorney
whom
he
have
employ
in
London
receive
his
instruction
with
surprise
and
evident
misgiving
;
however
,
they
could
only
obey
,
and
mutter
something
of
their
sorrow
that
such
heavy
cost
should
only
fall
upon
their
own
employer
,
 
especially
as
nothing
be
want
but
perseverance
to
throw
them
on
the
opposite
party

<EOS>
Bold
leave
the
office
which
he
have
latterly
so
much
frequent
,
shake
the
dust
from
off
his
foot
;
and
before
he
be
down
the
stair
,
an
edict
have
already
go
forth
for
the
preparation
of
the
bill
.
  
<EOS>
He
next
thought
of
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
the
case
have
be
take
up
by
more
than
one
;
and
he
be
well
aware
that
the
keynote
have
be
sound
by
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
very
intimate
with
Tom
Towers
,
and
have
often
discuss
with
him
the
affair
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Bold
could
not
say
that
the
article
in
that
paper
have
be
write
at
his
own
instigation
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
know
,
as
a
fact
,
that
they
have
be
write
by
his
friend

<EOS>
Tom
Towers
have
never
say
that
such
a
view
of
the
case
,
or
such
a
side
in
the
dispute
,
would
be
take
by
the
paper
with
which
he
be
connect
.
<EOS>
very
discreet
in
such
matter
be
Tom
Towers
,
and
altogether
indispose
to
talk
loosely
of
the
concern
of
that
mighty
engine
of
which
it
be
his
high
privilege
to
move
in
secret
some
portion
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
Bold
believe
that
to
him
be
owe
those
dreadful
word
which
have
cause
such
panic
at
Barchester
,
 
and
he
conceive
himself
bind
to
prevent
their
repetition
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
betake
himself
from
the
attorney
'
office
to
that
laboratory
where
,
with
amazing
chemistry
,
Tom
Towers
compound
thunderbolt
for
the
destruction
of
all

be
evil

furtherance
of

<EOS>
who
have
not

the

that

<EOS>
Velvet

It

what

<EOS>
an

appear

some

have
destroy
all

and
banish
him
for
ever
from

<EOS>
no
man
know
who
write
the
bitter
word
;
the
club
talk
confusedly
of
the

,
whisper
to

this

name
;
while
Tom

walk
quietly
along
Pall

with
his

close
against

wind
,
as
though

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
He

before

wander
round
that
lonely
spot
,
think
how
grand
a
thing
it
be
to
write
article
for

consider
within
himself
whether
by
any
stretch
of

within

he
could
ever
come
to
such
distinction
;
wonder
how
Tom

would
take
any
little
humble
offering
of
his
talent
;
calculate
that
Tom

himself
must
have
once
have
a
beginning
,
have
once
doubt
as

his
own
success
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
with
such
idea

half
ambitious

half
awe

strike

have
Bold
regard

;
but
he
have
never
yet
by
word
or
sign
attempt
to
influence
the
slight
word
of
his
unerring
friend
.
<EOS>
on
such
a
course
be
he
now
intent
;
and
not
without
much
inward
palpitation
do
he
betake
himself
to
the
quiet
abode
of
wisdom
,
where
Tom
Towers
be
to
be
find
o

inhaling
ambrosia

<EOS>
not

somewhat

<EOS>
old
St

<EOS>
its

but
nothing

it

mediæval
court
of
the

<EOS>
here

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
no

here
no

no

no

if

to

<EOS>
the

Would

not
more
taciturn
than
those
of
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
Wit

wine
be
always
here

and
always
together
;
the
revel
of
the
Temple
be
as
those
of
polished
Greece

where
the
wildest
worshipper
of
Bacchus
never
forget
the
dignity

the
god

<EOS>
where
can
retirement
be

complete
as
here

<EOS>
where
can

It

eminent

the

<EOS>
but
let
it
not
be
suppose
that
his
chamber
be
such
,
or
so
comfortless
,
as
be
frequently
the
gaunt
abode
of
legal
aspirant
.
<EOS>
four
chair
,
a
half

fill
deal
book
-
case
with
hanging
of
dingy
green
baize
,
an
old
office
table
cover
with
dusty
paper
,
which
be
not
move
once
in
six
month
,
and
an
old
Pembroke
brother
with
rickety
leg
,
for
all
daily
use
;
a
despatcher
for
the
preparation
of
lobster
and
coffee
,
and
an
apparatus
for
the
cooking
of
toast
and
mutton
chop
;
such
utensil
and
luxury
as
these
do
not
suffice
for
the
well
-
being
of
Tom
Towers
.
<EOS>
He
indulge
in
four
room
on
the
first
floor
,
each
of
which
be
furnish
,
if
not
with
the
splendour
,
with
probably
more
than
the
comfort
of
Stafford
House
.
<EOS>
every
addition
that
science
and
art
have
lately
make
to
the
luxury
of
modern
life
be
to
be
find
there
.
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
he
usually
sit
be
surround
by
book
-
shelf
carefully
fill
;
nor
be
there
a
volume
there
which
be
not
entitle
to
its
place
in
such
a
collection
,
both
by
its
intrinsic
worth
and
exterior
splendour
:
a
pretty
portable
set
of
step
in
one
corner
of
the
room
show
that
those
even
on
the
high
shelf
be
intend
for
use
.
<EOS>
the
chamber
contain
but
two
work
of
art
:
 
<EOS>
the
one
,
an
admirable
bust
of
Sir
Robert
Peel
,
by
Power
,
declare
the
individual
politic
of
our
friend
;
and
the
other
,
a
singularly
long
figure
of
a
female
devotee
,
by
Millais
,
tell
equally
plainly
the
school
of
art
to
which
he
be
addict
.
<EOS>
this
picture
be
not
hang
,
as
picture
usually
be
,
against
the
wall
;
there
be
no
inch
of
wall
vacant
for
such
a
purpose
:
it
have
a
stand
or
desk
erect
for
its
own
accommodation
;
and
there
on
her
pedestal
,
framed
and
glaze
,
stand
the
devotional
lady
look
intently
at
a
lily
as
no
lady
ever
look
before
.
  
<EOS>
Our
modern
artist
,
whom
we
style
Pre
-
Raphaelites
,
have
delight
to
go
back
,
not
only
to
the
finish
and
peculiar
manner
,
but
also
to
the
subject
of
the
early
painter
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
give
them
too
much
praise
for
the
elaborate
perseverance
with
which
they
have
equal
the
minute
perfection
of
the
master
from
whom
they
take
their
inspiration
:
nothing
probably
can
exceed
the
painting
of
some
of
these
latter
-
day
picture
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
singular
into
what
fault
they
fall
as
regard
their
subject
:
they
be
not
quite
content
to
take
the
old
stock
group
,
 
a
Sebastian
with
his
arrow
,
a
Lucia
with
her
eye
in
a
dish
,
a
Lorenzo
with
a
gridiron
,
or
the
Virgin
with
two
child
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
anything
but
happy
in
their
change
.
<EOS>
as
a
rule
,
no
figure
should
be
draw
in
a
position
which
it
be
impossible
to
suppose
any
figure
should
maintain
.
<EOS>
the
patient
endurance
of
St
Sebastian
,
the
wild
ecstasy
of
St
John
in
the
Wilderness
,
the
maternal
love
of
the
Virgin
,
be
feeling
naturally
portray
by
a
fix
posture
;
but
the
lady
with
the
stiff
back
and
bent
neck
,
who
look
at
her
flower
,
and
be
still
look
from
hour
to
hour
,
give
us
an
idea
of
pain
without
grace
,
and
abstraction
without
a
cause
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
,
from
his
room
,
to
see
that
Tom
Towers
be
a
Sybarite
,
though
by
no
means
an
idle
one
.
<EOS>
He
be
linger
over
his
last
cup
of
tea
,
surround
by
an
ocean
of
newspaper
,
through
which
he
have
be
swim
,
when
John
Bold
's
card
be
bring
in
by
his
tiger
.
<EOS>
this
tiger
never
know
that
his
master
be
at
home
,
though
he
often
know
that
he
be
not
,
and
thus
Tom
Towers
be
never
invade
but
by
his
own
consent
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
after
twist
the
card
twice
in
his
finger
,
he
signify
to
his
attendant
imp
that
he
be
visible
;
and
the
inner
door
be
unbolted
,
and
our
friend
announce
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
before
say
that
he
of
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
and
John
Bold
be
intimate
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
very
great
difference
in
their
age
,
for
tower
be
still
considerably
under
forty
;
and
when
Bold
have
be
attend
the
London
hospital
,
Towers
,
who
be
not
then
the
great
man
that
he
have
since
become
,
have
be
much
with
him
.
<EOS>
then
they
have
often
discuss
together
the
object
of
their
ambition
and
future
prospect
;
then
Tom
Towers
be
struggle
hard
to
maintain
himself
,
as
a
briefless
barrister
,
by
shorthand
report
for
any
of
the
paper
that
would
engage
him
;
then
he
have
not
dare
to
dream
of
write
leader
for
_
the
Jupiter
_
,
or
canvass
the
conduct
of
Cabinet
minister
.
<EOS>
thing
have
alter
since
that
time
:
the
briefless
barrister
be
still
briefless
,
but
he
now
despise
brief
:
could
he
have
be
sure
of
a
judge
's
seat
,
he
would
hardly
have
leave
his
present
career
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
he
wear
no
ermine
,
bear
no
outward
mark
of
a
world
's
respect
;
but
with
what
a
load
of
inward
importance
be
he
charge
!
<EOS>
It
be
true
his
name
appear
in
no
large
capital
;
on
no
wall
be
chalk
up
"
Tom
Towers
for
ever
;
"
 
"
freedom
of
the
Press
and
Tom
Towers
;
"
but
what
member
of
Parliament
have
half
his
power
?
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
in
far
-
off
province
man
do
not
talk
daily
of
Tom
Towers
<EOS>
but
they
read
_
<EOS>
the

_
,
and
acknowledge
that
without
_

life
be
not
worth
have
.
<EOS>
this
kind
of
hidden
but
still
conscious
glory
suit
the
nature
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
love
to
sit
silent
in
a
corner
of
his
club
and
listen
to
the
loud
chattering
of
politician
,
and
to
think
how
they
all
be
in
his
power
;
 
how
he
could
smite
the
loud
of
them
,
be
it
worth
his
while
to
raise
his
pen
for
such
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
love
to
watch
the
great
man
of
whom
he
daily
write
,
and
flatter
himself
that
he
be
great
than
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
each
of
them
be
responsible
to
his
country
,
each
of
them
must
answer
if
inquire
into
,
each
of
them
must
endure
abuse
with
good
humour
,
and
insolence
without
anger
.
<EOS>
but
to
whom
be
he
,
Tom
Towers
,
responsible
?
<EOS>
no
one
could
insult
him
;
no
one
could
inquire
into
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
speak
out
wither
word
,
and
no
one
could
answer
him
<EOS>
:
minister
court
him
,
though
perhaps
they
know
not
his
name
;
bishop
fear
him
;
judge
doubt
their
own
verdict
unless
he
confirm
them
;
and
general
,
in
their
council
of
war
,
do
not
consider
more
deeply
what
the
enemy
would
do
,
than
what
_
<EOS>
the
Jupiter
_
would
say
.
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
never
boast
of
_
the
Jupiter
_
;
he
scarcely
ever
name
the
paper
even
to
the
most
intimate
of
his
friend
;
he
do
not
even
wish
to
be
speak
of
as
connect
with
it
;
but
he
do
not
the
less
value
his
privilege
,
or
think
the
less
of
his
own
importance
.
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
Tom
Towers
consider
himself
the
most
powerful
man
in
Europe
;
and
so
he
walk
on
from
day
to
day
,
studiously
strive
to
look
a
man
,
but
know
within
his
breast
that
he
be
a
god

<EOS>
Bold
could
not

it
be
one
of
those

require

good

<EOS>

he
throw
a

Bold

<EOS>
Dr

Anticant
be
a
Scotchman
,
who
have
pass
a
great
portion
of
his
early

he
have
study
there
with
much
effect

and
have
learn
to
look
with
german
subtilty
into
the
root
of
thing
,
and
to
examine
for
himself
their
intrinsic
worth
and
worthlessness
.
<EOS>
no
man
ever
resolve
more
bravely
than
he
to
accept
as
good
nothing
that
be
evil
;
to
banish
from
him
as
evil
nothing
that
be
good
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
pity
that
he
should
not
have
recognise
the
fact
,
that
in
this
world
no
good
be
unalloyed
,
and
that
there
be
but
little
evil
that
have
not
in
it
some
seed
of
what
be
goodly

<EOS>
return
from
Germany
,
he
have
astonish
the
reading
public

the
vigour

his
thought

put
forth
in
the
quaint
language
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
write
English
,
say
the
critic
.
<EOS>
no
matter
,
say
the
public
;
we
can
read
what
he
do
write
,
and
that
without
yawn

<EOS>
and
so
Dr
Pessimist
Anticant
become
popular

<EOS>
popularity
spoil
him
for
all
further
real
use
,
as
it
have
do
many
another
.
<EOS>
while
,
with
some
diffidence
,
he
confine
his
objurgation
to
the
occasional
folly
or
shortcoming
of
mankind
;
while
he
ridicule
the
energy
of
the
squire
devote
to
the
slaughter
of
partridge
,
or
the
mistake
of
some
noble
patron
who
turn
a
poet
into
a
gauger
of
beer
-
barrel
,
it
be
all
well
;
we
be
glad
to
be
tell
our
fault
and
to
look
forward
to
the
come
millennium
,
when
all
man
,
have
sufficiently
study
the
work
of
Dr
Anticant
,
would
become
truthful
and
energetic
.
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
mistake
the
sign
of
the
time
and
the
mind
of
man
,
institute
himself
censor
of
thing
in
general
,
and
begin
the
great
task
of
reprobate
everything
and
everybody
,
without
further
promise
of
any
millennium
at
all
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
so
well
;
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
our
author
do
not
succeed
in
his
undertaking
.
<EOS>
His
theory
be
all
beautiful
,
and
the
code
of
moral
that
he
teach
us
certainly
an
improvement
on
the
practice
of
the
age

<EOS>
We
all
of
us
could
,
and
many
of
us
do
,
learn
much
from
the
doctor
while
he
choose
to
remain
vague
,
mysterious
,
and
cloudy
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
become
practical
,
the
charm
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
His
allusion
to
the
poet
and
the
partridge
be
receive
very
well

"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
well

this
give
us
some
hope

<EOS>
We
may
do
better
with
our
next
poet
,
when
we
get
one
;
and
though
the
partridge
may
not
be
abandon
,
something
could
perhaps
be
do
as
to
the
poacher
.
<EOS>
We
be
unwilling
,
however
,
to
take
lesson
in
politic
from
so
misty
a
professor

and
when
he
come
to
tell
us
that
the
hero
of
Westminster

naught

we
begin
to

that
he
have
write

<EOS>
His
attack
upon

box
be
not
think

have
much

as
it

<EOS>
I
for

<EOS>
there
may
be
truth
in
this

there
may
be
depth

reasoning

Englishmen
do
not
see
enough
in
the
argument
to
induce
them
to
withdraw
their
confidence
from
the
present
arrangement
of
the
government

and
Dr
Anticant

monthly
pamphlet
on
the
decay
of
the
world
do
not
receive
so
much
attention
as
his
early
work
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
confine
himself
to
politic
in
these
publication
,
but
roam
at
large
over
all
matter
of
public
interest
,
and
find
everything
bad
.
<EOS>
accord
to
him
nobody
be
true
,
and
not
only
nobody

nothing
;
a
man
could
not
take
off
his
hat
to
a

tell
a
lie

the
lady
would
lie
again
in
smile

<EOS>
the
ruffle
of
the

shirt
would
be
fraught
with
deceit
,
and
the
lady

flounce
full
of
falsehood
.
<EOS>
be
ever
anything
more
severe
than
that
attack
of
his
on
chip
bonnet
,
or
the
anathema
with
which
he
endeavour
to
dust
the
powder
out
of

<EOS>
the
pamphlet
which
Tom

now
push

be
entitle
"
Modern
Charity

be
write
with
the
view

prove
how
much
in
the
way
of
charity
be
do
by
our
predecessor

<EOS>
how
little
by
the
present
age

and
it
end
by
a
comparison
between
ancient

modern
time
,
very
little

bold
read
as
follow
    
Heavens
,
what
a
sight
!
<EOS>
let
us
with
eye
wide
open
see
the
godly
man
of
four
century
since
,
the
man
of
the
dark
age
;
let
us
see
how
he
do
his
godlike
work
,
and
,
again
,
how
the
godly
man
of
these
latter
day
do
his
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
we
say
that
the
former
be
one
walk
painfully
through
the
world
,
regard
,
as
a
prudent
man
,
his
worldly
work
,
prosper
in
it
as
a
diligent
man
will
prosper
,
but
always
with
an
eye
to
that
well
treasure
to
which
thief
do
not
creep
in
?
<EOS>
be
there
not
much
nobility
in
that
old
man
,
as
,
lean
on
his
oaken
staff
,
he
walk
down
the
High
Street
of
his
native
town
,
and
receive
from
all
courteous
salutation
and
acknowledgment
of
his
worth
?
<EOS>
a
noble
old
man
,
my
august
inhabitant
of
Belgrave
Square
and
such
like
vicinity
,
 
a
very
noble
old
man
,
though
employ
no
better
than
in
the
wholesale
carding
of
wool
.
  
<EOS>
this
carding
of
wool
,
however
,
do
in
those
day
bring
with
it
much
profit
,
so
that
our
ancient
friend
,
when
die
,
be
declare
,
in
whatever
slang
then
prevail
,
to
cut
up
exceed
well
.
<EOS>
for
son
and
daughter
there
be
ample
sustenance
with
assistance
of
due
industry
;
for
friend
and
relative
some
relief
for
grief
at
this
great
loss
;
for
aged
dependent
comfort
in
decline
year
.
<EOS>
this
be
much
for
one
old
man
to
get
do
in
that
dark
fifteenth
century
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
:
come
generation
of
poor
wool

carder
should
bless
the
name
of
this
rich
one
;
and
a
hospital
should
be
found
and
endow
with
his
wealth
for
the
feeding
of
such
of
the
trade
as
could
not
,
by
diligent
carding
,
any

duly
feed
themselves

Twas
thus
that
an
old
man
in
the
fifteenth
century
do
his
godlike
work
to
the
good
of
his
power
,
and
not
ignobly

as
appear

We
will
now
take
our

He
shall
no

be
a

carder

for
such

We
will
suppose
him
to
be
one
of
the
good
of

one
who
have
lack
no
opportunity

Our

<EOS>

now
,
in
what
perfect
manner
do
he
in
this
low

<EOS>
get
his
godlike
work
do

put
out

in

strange
of
manner

oh

my

<EOS>
in
a
manner
not
at
all
to
be
believe
,
but
by
the
most
minute
testimony
of
eyesight
.
<EOS>
He
do
it
by
the
magnitude
of
his
appetite
,
 
by
the
power
of
his
gorge
;
his
only
occupation
be
to
swallow
the
bread
prepare
with
so
much
anxious
care
for
these
impoverished
carder
of
wool
,
 
that
,
and
to
sing
indifferently
through
his
nose
once
in
the
week
some
psalm
more

the
short

<EOS>
Bold
certainly
think
that
his

would
not
like
that
:
he
could
not
conceive
anything
that
he

than
this

to

a

of
toil

have
he
,
Bold
,
give
rise
by
his
indiscreet
attack
upon

!
  
<EOS>
"
You

that

have
in

declare
that

<EOS>
this
be
all
wormwood
to
Bold

<EOS>
He
have
do
enough
to
make
his
friend
the
warden
miserable
for
life
,
and
have
then
back
out
just
when
the
success
of
his
project
be
sufficient
to
make
the
question
one
of
real
interest

<EOS>
how
weakly
he
have
manage
his
business
!
<EOS>
he
have
already
do
the
harm

then
stay
his
hand
when
the
good
which
he
have
in

be
to
be
commence

<EOS>
how
delightful
would
it
have
be
to
have
employ
all
his
energy
in
such
a
cause
,
 
to
have
be
back
by
_
the

,
and
write
up
to

two
of
the
most
popular
author

the
idea
open
a
view
into

he
wish

to
what
may
it
not
have
give
rise
?
<EOS>
what
delightful
intimacy

what
public
praise

to
what
athenian
banquet

rich
flavour
of

salt

this

could
he
have
forget
the

he
have
go
too
far

retreat

He
be
now

this

sit
in

the
object
of
deprecate
any
further
article

greatly

Mr

have
feel
what
it
have
say
deeply

I
think
that

could
explain
to
you
that
he
personally
have
not
be
to
blame

these

may
be
discontinue

how
calmly
impassive

innocent
little

have
Bold
address
himself
to
the
doorpost
in
Mount
Olympus
,
they
would
have
show
as
much
outward
sign
of
assent
or
dissent

<EOS>
His
quiescence
be
quite
admirable

his
discretion
certainly
more
than
human

"
<EOS>
My

I
really
can
not

if
you

them

pluck
up
his
courage

remember
that

he
be
bind
to
make

I
have
no
doubt
in

that
you
write
the

yourself

very
well
write
they
be
:
it
will
be
a
great
favour

you
will

abstain

you
do

You
think
that

be
able
to
keep
certain
remark
out
of

Your
information
be
probably
incorrect

as

on

be

at

you
think
I
have
such

to
use
it

now
that
be

<EOS>

well
,
if

if

be
induce
either
to
write

to
abstain
from

by
private
motive

surely
the
public
press
would
soon
be
of
little
value
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
recognise
worth
of

see
if
it
do
not
mainly
depend
on
the
assurance

John

inward

so
coveted

It
be
the
impregnability
of

make

so
angry

it
be
the

quality

it

<EOS>
We
get
on
now
with
a
light

quicker
:
<EOS>
ridicule

<EOS>
of
all
such
reformer
Mr

be
the
most
powerful
.
<EOS>
It
be
incredible
the
number
of
evil
practice
he
have
put
down
:
it
be
to
be
fear
he
will
soon
lack

that
when
he
have
make

put
into
proper

sized
pint
bottle
,
there
will
be
nothing
further
for
him
leave
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sentiment
be
certainly
a
very
powerful
man
,
and
perhaps
not
the
less
so
that
his
good
poor
people
be
so
very
good
;
his
hard
rich
people
so
very
hard
;
and
the
genuinely

so
very
honest

<EOS>
Namby

<EOS>
divine

be
no

interesting

though
possess

but
a

peasant
or
an

hero
may
talk
as
much
twaddle
as
one
of
Mrs

still

<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
Mr

's
great

be
in

<EOS>
if
his

I
fear

ever

their
attendant
satellite
be
as
natural
as
though

they

yes

here
the

the
Mephistopheles
of

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
the
demon
of
"
the
Almshouse
"
be
the
clerical
owner
of
this
comfortable
abode
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
well
stricken
in
year
,
but
still
strong
to
do
evil
:
he
be
one
who
look
cruelly
out
of
a
hot
,
passionate
,
bloodshot
eye
;
who
have
a
huge
red
nose
with
a
carbuncle
,
thick
lip
,
and
a
great
double
,
flabby
chin
,
which
swell
out
into
solid
substance
,
like
a
turkey
-
cock
's
comb
,
when
sudden
anger
inspire
him
:
<EOS>
he
have
a
hot
,
furrowed
,
low
brow
,
from
which
a
few
grizzle
hair
be
not
yet
rub
off
by
the
friction
of
his

:
he
wear
a
loose
unstarche
white
handkerchief
,
black
loose
ill
-
make
clothe
,
and
huge
loose
shoe
,
adapt
to
many
corn
and
various
bunion
:
his
husky
voice
tell
tale
of
much
daily
port
wine
,
and
his
language
be
not
so
decorous
as
become
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
master
of
Mr
Sentiment
's
"
almshouse
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
widower
,
but
at
present
accompany
by
two
daughter
,
and
a
thin
and
somewhat
insipid
curate
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
young
lady
be
devoted
to
her
father
and
the
fashionable
world
,
and
she
of
course
be
the
favourite
;
the
other
be
equally
addict
to
puseyism
and
the
curate
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
chapter
of
course
introduce
the
reader
to
the
more
especial
inmate
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
here
be
discover
eight
old
man
;
and
it
be
give
to
be
understand
that
four
vacancy
remain
unfilled
,
through
the
perverse
ill
-
nature
of
the
clerical
gentleman
with
the
double
chin
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
these
eight
pauper
be
touchingly
dreadful
:
sixpence
-
farthe
a
day
have
be
sufficient
for
their
diet
when
the
almshouse
be
found
;
and
on
sixpence
-
farthe
a
day
be
they
still
doom
to
starve
,
though
food
be
four
time
as
dear
,
and
money
four
time
as
plentiful
.
<EOS>
It
be
shocking
to
find
how
the
conversation
of
these
eight
starve
old
man
in
their
dormitory
<EOS>
shame
that
of
the
clergyman
's
family
in
his
rich
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
absolute
word
they
utter
be
not
perhaps
speak
in
the
pure
English
,
and
it
may
be
difficult
to
distinguish
from
their
dialect
to
what
part
of
the
country
they
belong
;
the
beauty
of
the
sentiment
,
however
,
amply
atone
for
the
imperfection
of
the
language
;
and
it
be
really
a
pity
that
these
eight
old
man
could
not
be
send
through
the
country
as
moral
missionary
,
instead
of
be
immure
and
starve
in
that
wretched
almshouse
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
finish
the
number
;
and
as
he
throw
it
aside
,
he
think
that
that
at
least
have
no
direct
appliance
to
Mr
Harding
,
and
that
the
absurdly
strong
colouring
of
the
picture
would
disenable
the
work
from
do
either
good
or
harm
.
<EOS>
He
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
artist
who
paint
for
the
million
must
use
glare
colour
,
as
no
one
know
better
than
Mr
Sentiment
when
he
describe
the
inhabitant
of
his
almshouse
;
and
the
radical
reform
which
have
now
sweep
over
such
establishment
have
owe
more
to
the
twenty
number
of
Mr
Sentiment
's
novel
,
than
to
all
the
true
complaint
which
have
escape
from
the
public
for
the
last
half

.
   
<EOS>
a

<EOS>
the

his
very
moderate

of

to

his
son
-
in

law
the
slip
,
and
get
out
of
Barchester
without

on
his

.
<EOS>
no
schoolboy
ever
run
away
from
school
with
more
precaution
and
more
dread
of
detection
;
no
convict
,
slip
down
from
a
prison
wall
,
ever
fear
to
see
the
gaoler
more
entirely
than
Mr

do

as
he
drive
up
in

pony
carriage
to

on

be
very
sudden

have
entrust
this

he

the
illustrious

learn
gentleman
to
vouchsafe
to
him
ten
minute
'
audience
at
any
hour
on
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
calculate
that
for
that
one
day
he
be
safe
;
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
he
have
no
doubt
,
would
arrive
in
town
by
an
early
train
,
but
not
early
enough
to
reach
the
truant
till
he
should
have
escape
from
his
hotel
after
breakfast
;
and
could
he
thus
manage
to
see
the
lawyer
on
that
very
day
,
the
deed
may
be
do
before
the
archdeacon
could
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
arrival
in
town
the
warden
drive
,
as
be
his
will
not
,
to
the
Chapter
Hotel
and
Coffee
House
,
near
St
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
His
visit
to
London
of
late
have
not
be
frequent
;
but
in
those
happy
day
when
"
Harding
's
Church
Music
"
be
go
through
the
press
,
he
have
be
often
there
;
and
as
the
publisher
's
house
be
in
Paternoster
Row
,
and
the
printer
's
press
in
Fleet
Street
,
the
Chapter
Hotel
and
Coffee
House
have
be
convenient
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
quiet
,
sombre
,
clerical
house
,
beseem
such
a
man
as
the
warden
,
and
thus
he
afterwards
frequent
it
.
<EOS>
have
he
dare
,
he
would
on
this
occasion
have
go
elsewhere
to
throw
the
archdeacon
further
off
the
scent
;
but
he
do
not
know
what
violent
step
his
son
-
in
-
law
may
take
for
his
recovery
if
he
be
not
find
at
his
usual
haunt
,
and
he
deem
it
not
prudent
to
make
himself
the
object
of
a
hunt
through
London
.
  
<EOS>
arrive
at
his
inn
,
he
order
dinner
,
and
go
forth
to
the
attorney
-
general
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
there
he
learn
that
Sir
Abraham
be
in
Court
,
and
would
not
probably
return
that
day
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
direct
from
Court
to
the
House
;
all
appointment
be
,
as
a
rule
,
make
at
the
chamber
;
the
clerk
could
by
no
means
promise
an
interview
for
the
next
day
;
be
able
,
on
the
other
hand
,
to
say
that
such
interview
be
,
he
think
,
impossible
;
but
that
Sir
Abraham
would
certainly
be
at
the
House
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
where
an
answer
from
himself
may
possibly
be
elicit
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
House
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
go
,
and
leave
his
note
,
not
find
Sir
Abraham
there
.
<EOS>
He
add
a
most
piteous
entreaty
that
he
may
be
favour
with
an
answer
that
evening
,
for
which
he
would
return
.
<EOS>
He
then
journey
back
sadly
to
the
Chapter
Coffee
House
,
digest
his
great
thought
,
as
best
he
may
,
in
a
clatter
omnibus
,
wedge
in
between
a
wet
old
lady
and
a
journeyman
glazier
return
from
his
work
with
his
tool
in
his
lap
.
<EOS>
in
melancholy
solitude
he
discuss
his
mutton
chop
and
pint
of
port
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
this
world
more
melancholy
than
such
a
dinner
?
<EOS>
a
dinner
,
though
eat
alone
,
in
a
country
hotel
may
be
worthy
of
some
energy
;
the
waiter
,
if
you
be
know
,
will
make
much
of
you
;
the
landlord
will
make
you
a
bow
and
perhaps
put
the
fish
on
the
table
;
if
you
ring
you
be
attend
to
,
and
there
be
some
life
about
it
.
<EOS>
a
dinner
at
a
London
eat
-
house
be
also
lively
enough
,
if
it
have
no
other
attraction
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
noise
and
stir
about
it
,
and
the
rapid
whirl
of
voice
and
rattle
of
dish
disperse
sadness
.
<EOS>
but
a
solitary
dinner
in
an
old
,
respectable
,
sombre
,
solid
London
inn
,
where
nothing
make
any
noise
but
the
old
waiter
's
creaking
shoe
;
where
one
plate
slowly
go
and
another
slowly
come
without
a
sound
;
where
the
two
or
three
guest
would
as
soon
think
of
knock
each
other
down
as
of
speak
;
where
the
servant
whisper
,
and
the
whole
household
be
disturb
if
an
order
be
give
above
the
voice
,
 
what
can
be
more
melancholy
than
a
mutton
chop
and
a
pint
of
port
in
such
a
place
?
  
<EOS>
have
go
through
this
Mr
Harding
get
into
another
omnibus
,
and
again
return
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Sir
Abraham
be
there
,
and
be
that
moment
on
his
leg
,
fight
eagerly
for
the
hundred
and
seventh
clause
of
the
Convent
Custody
Bill
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
note
have
be
deliver
to
him
;
and
if
Mr
Harding
would
wait
some
two
or
three
hour
,
Sir
Abraham
could
be
ask
whether
there
be
any
answer
.
<EOS>
the
House
be
not
full
,
and
perhaps
Mr
Harding
may
get
admittance
into
the
Strangers
'
Gallery
,
which
admission
,
with
the
help
of
five
shilling
,
Mr
Harding
be
able
to
effect
.
  
<EOS>
this
bill
of
Sir
Abraham
's
have
be
read
a
second
time
and
pass
into
committee
.
<EOS>
a
hundred
and
six
clause
have
already
be
discuss
and
have
occupy
only
four
morning
and
five
evening
sitting
;
nine
of
the
hundred
and
six
clause
be
pass
,
fifty
-
five
be
withdraw
by
consent
,
fourteen
have
be
alter
so
as
to
mean
the
reverse
of
the
original
proposition
,
eleven
have
be
postpone
for
further
consideration
,
and
seventeen
have
be
directly
negative
.
<EOS>
the
hundred
and
seventh
order
the
bodily
searching
of
nun
for
jesuitical
symbol
by
aged
clergyman
,
and
be
consider
to
be
the
real
mainstay
of
the
whole
bill
.
<EOS>
no
intention
have
ever
exist
to
pass
such
a
law
as
that
propose
,
but
the
government
do
not
intend
to
abandon
it
till
their
object
be
fully
attain
by
the
discussion
of
this
clause
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
that
it
would
be
insist
on
with
terrible
vehemence
by
protestant
irish
member
,
and
as
vehemently
denounce
by
the
Roman
Catholic
;
and
it
be
justly
consider
that
no
further
union
between
the
party
would
be
possible
after
such
a
battle
.
<EOS>
the
innocent
Irish
fall
into
the
trap
as
they
always
do
,
and
whiskey
and
poplin
become
a
drug
in
the
market
.
  
<EOS>
a
florid

the
speaker

eye
by
the
time
that
Mr

have

into

be
denounce
the

<EOS>
(
deafen
cheer
and
laughter
,
which
be

till
the
honourable
member
resume
his

)
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Harding
have
listen
to
this
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
for
about
three
hour
,
he
return
to
the
door
of
the
House
,
and
receive
back
from
the
messenger
his
own
note
,
with
the
follow
word
scrawl
in
pencil
on
the
back
of
it
:
"
to
-
morrow
,
10
P.M.
 
my
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
a.
H.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
far
successful
;
 
but
10
P.M.
:
<EOS>
what
an
hour
Sir
Abraham
have
name
for
a
legal
interview
!
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
feel
perfectly
sure
that
long
before
that
Dr
grantly
would
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
Dr
grantly
could
not
,
however
,
know
that
this
interview
have
be
arrange
,
nor
could
he
learn
it
unless
he
manage
to
get
hold
of
Sir
Abraham
before
that
hour
;
and
as
this
be
very
improbable
,
Mr
Harding
determine
to
start
from
his
hotel
early
,
merely
leave
word
that
he
should
dine
out
,
and
unless
luck
be
much
against
him
,
he
may
still
escape
the
archdeacon
till
his
return
from
the
attorney
-
general
's
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
at
breakfast
at
nine
,
and
for
the
twentieth
time
consult
his
Bradshaw
,
to
see
at
what
early
hour
Dr
grantly
could
arrive
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
as
he
examine
the
column
,
he
be
nearly
petrify
by
the
reflection
that
perhaps
the
archdeacon
may
come
up
by
the
night
-
mail
train
!
<EOS>
His
heart
sink
within
him
at
the
horrid
idea
,
and
for
a
moment
he
feel
himself
drag
back
to
Barchester
without
accomplish
any
portion
of
his
object
.
<EOS>
then
he
remember
that
have
Dr
grantly
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
would
have
be
in
the
hotel
,
look
for
him
long
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
"
say
he
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
the
waiter
approach
,
creak
in
his
shoe
,
but
voiceless
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
any
gentleman
,
 
a
clergyman
,
arrive
here
by
the
night
-
mail
train
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
not
one
,
"
whisper
the
waiter
,
put
his
mouth
nearly
close
to
the
warden
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
reassure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
"
say
he
again
,
and
the
waiter
again
creak
up
.
<EOS>
"
if
anyone
call
for
me
,
I
be
go
to
dine
out
,
and
shall
return
about
eleven
o'clock
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
waiter
nodded
,
but
do
not
this
time
vouchsafe
any
reply
;
and
Mr
Harding
,
take
up
his
hat
,
proceed
out
to
pass
a
long
day
in
the
good
way
he
could
,
somewhere
out
of
sight
of
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
Bradshaw
have
tell
him
twenty
time
that
Dr
grantly
could
not
be
at
Paddington
station
till
2
P.M.
,
and
our
poor
friend
may
therefore
have
trust
to
the
shelter
of
the
hotel
for
some
hour
longer
with
perfect
safety
;
but
he
be
nervous
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
what
step
the
archdeacon
may
take
for
his
apprehension
:
a
message
by
electric
telegraph
may
desire
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
to
set
a
watch
upon
him
;
some
letter
may
come
which
he
may
find
himself
unable
to
disobey
;
at
any
rate
,
he
could
not
feel
himself
secure
in
any
place
at
which
the
archdeacon
could
expect
to
find
him
;
and
at
10
A.M.
he
start
forth
to
spend
twelve
hour
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
have
friend
in
town
have
he
choose
to
seek
them
;
but
he
feel
that
he
be
in
no
humour
for
ordinary
call
,
and
he
do
not
now
wish
to
consult
with
anyone
as
to
the
great
step
which
he
have
determine
to
take
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
say
to
his
daughter
,
no
one
know
where
the
shoe
pinche
but
the
wearer
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
point
on
which
no
man
can
be
content
to
follow
the
advice
of
another
,
 
some
subject
on
which
a
man
can
consult
his
own
conscience
only
.
<EOS>
Our
warden
have
make
up
his
mind
that
it
be
good
for
him
at
any
cost
to
get
rid
of
this
grievance
;
his
daughter
be
the
only
person
whose
concurrence
appear
necessary
to
him
,
and
she
do
concur
with
him
most
heartily
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
he
would
not
,
if
he
could
help
it
,
consult
anyone
further
,
till
advice
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
Should
the
archdeacon
catch
him
,
indeed
,
there
would
be
much
advice
,
and
much
consultation
of
a
kind
not
to
be
avoid
;
but
he
hope
well
thing
;
and
as
he
feel
that
he
could
not
now
converse
on
indifferent
subject
,
he
resolve
to
see
no
one
till
after
his
interview
with
the
attorney
-
general
.
  
<EOS>
He
determine
to
take
sanctuary
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
so
he
again
go
thither
in
an
omnibus
,
and
find
that
the
door
be
not
open
for
morning
service
,
he
pay
his
twopence
,
and
go
in
as
a
sightseer
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
him
that
he
have
no
definite
place
of
rest
for
the
day
,
and
that
he
should
be
absolutely
wear
out
before
his
interview
if
he
attempt
to
walk
about
from
10
A.M.
to
10
P.M.
,
so
he
sit
himself
down
on
a
stone
step
,
and
gaze
up
at
the
figure
of
William
Pitt
,
who
look
as
though
he
have
just
enter
the
church
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
be
anything
but
pleased
at
find
himself
there
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
sit
unmoleste
about
twenty
minute
when
the
verger
ask
him
whether
he
would
not
like
to
walk
round
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
do
not
want
to
walk
anywhere
,
and
decline
,
merely
observe
that
he
be
wait
for
the
morning
service
.
<EOS>
the
verger
,
see
that
he
be
a
clergyman
,
tell
him
that
the
door
of
the
choir
be
now
open
,
and
show
him
into
a
seat
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
point
gain
;
the
archdeacon
would
certainly
not
come
to
morning
service
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
even
though
he
be
in
London
;
and
here
the
warden
could
rest
quietly
,
and
,
when
the
time
come
,
duly
say
his
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
He
long
to
get
up
from
his
seat
,
and
examine
the
music
-
book
of
the
chorister
,
and
the
copy
of
the
litany
from
which
the
service
be
chant
,
to
see
how
far
the
little
detail
at
Westminster
correspond
with
those
at
Barchester
,
and
whether
he
think
his
own
voice
would
fill
the
church
well
from
the
Westminster
precentor
's
seat
.
<EOS>
there
would
,
however
,
be
impropriety
in
such
meddling
,
and
he
sit
perfectly
still
,
look
up
at
the
noble
roof
,
and
guard
against
the
come
fatigue
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
two
or
three
people
enter
;
the
very
same
damp
old
woman
who
have
nearly
obliterate
him
in
the
omnibus
,
or
some
other
just
like
her
;
a
couple
of
young
lady
with
their
veil
down
,
and
gilt
crosse
conspicuous
on
their
prayer
-
book
;
an
old
man
on
crutch
;
a
party
who
be
see
the
abbey
,
and
think
they
may
as
well
hear
the
service
for
their
twopence
,
as
opportunity
serve
;
and
a
young
woman
with
her
prayer
-
book
do
up
in
her
handkerchief
,
who
rush
in
late
,
and
,
in
her
hurried
entry
,
tumble
over
one
of
the
form
,
and
make
such
a
noise
that
everyone
,
even
the
officiating
minor
canon
,
be
startled
,
and
she
herself
be
so
frightened
by
the
echo
of
her
own
catastrophe
that
she
be
nearly
throw
into
fit
by
the
panic
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
not
much
edify
by
the
manner
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
the
minor
canon
in
question
hurry
in
,
somewhat
late
,
in
a
surplice
not
in
the
neat
order
,
and
be
follow
by
a
dozen
chorister
,
who
be
also
not
as
trim
as
they
may
have
be
:
they
all
jostle
into
their
place
with
a
quick
hurried
step
,
and
the
service
be
soon
commence
.
<EOS>
soon
commence
and
soon
over
,
 
for
there
be
no
music
,
and
time
be
not
unnecessarily
lose
in
the
chanting
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
Mr
Harding
be
of
opinion
that
thing
be
manage
better
at
Barchester
,
though
even
there
he
know
that
there
be
room
for
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
us
a
question
whether
any
clergyman
can
go
through
our
church
service
with
decorum
,
morning
after
morning
,
in
an
immense
building
,
surround
by
not
more
than
a
dozen
listener
.
<EOS>
the
good
actor
can
not
act
well
before
empty
bench
,
and
though
there
be
,
of
course
,
a
high
motive
in
one
case
than
the
other
,
still
even
the
good
of
clergyman
can
not
but
be
influence
by
their
audience
;
and
to
expect
that
a
duty
should
be
well
do
under
such
circumstance
,
would
be
to
require
from
human
nature
more
than
human
power
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
two
lady
with
the
gilt
crosse
,
the
old
man
with
his
crutch
,
and
the
still
palpitate
housemaid
be
go
,
Mr
Harding
find
himself
oblige
to
go
too
.
<EOS>
the
verger
stand
in
his
way
,
and
look
at
him
and
look
at
the
door
,
and
so
he
go
.
<EOS>
but
he
return
again
in
a
few
minute
,
and
re
-
enter
with
another
twopence
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
sanctuary
so
good
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
slowly
down
the
nave
,
and
then
up
one
aisle
,
and
then
again
down
the
nave
and
up
the
other
aisle
,
he
try
to
think
gravely
of
the
step
he
be
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
give
up
eight
hundred
a
year
voluntarily
;
and
doom
himself
to
live
for
the
rest
of
his
life
on
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
hitherto
fail
to
realise
this
fact
as
he
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
Could
he
maintain
his
own
independence
and
support
his
daughter
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
year
without
be
a
burden
on
anyone
?
<EOS>
His
son
-
in
-
law
be
rich
,
but
nothing
could
induce
him
to
lean
on
his
son
-
in
-
law
after
act
,
as
he
intend
to
do
,
in
direct
opposition
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
counsel
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
rich
,
but
he
be
about
to
throw
away
the
bishop
's
good
gift
,
and
that
in
a
manner
to
injure
materially
the
patronage
of
the
giver
<EOS>
:
he
could
neither
expect
nor
accept
anything
further
from
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
not
only
no
merit
,
but
positive
disgrace
,
in
give
up
his
wardenship
,
if
he
be
not
prepared
to
meet
the
world
without
it
.
<EOS>
yes
,
he
must
from
this
time
forward
bind
all
his
human
wish
for
himself
and
his
daughter
to
the
poor
extent
of
so
limited
an
income
.
<EOS>
He
know
he
have
not
think
sufficiently
of
this
,
that
he
have
be
carry
away
by
enthusiasm
,
and
have
hitherto
not
bring
home
to
himself
the
full
reality
of
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
most
about
his
daughter
,
naturally
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
she
be
engage
,
and
he
know
enough
of
his
propose
son
-
in
-
law
to
be
sure
that
his
own
altered
circumstance
would
make
no
obstacle
to
such
a
marriage
;
nay
,
he
be
sure
that
the
very
fact
of
his
poverty
would
induce
bold
more
anxiously
to
press
the
matter
;
but
he
dislike
count
on
Bold
in
this
emergency
,
bring
on
,
as
it
have
be
,
by
his
doing
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
say
to
himself
,
Bold
have
turn
me
out
of
my
house
and
income
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
must
relieve
me
of
my
daughter
;
he
prefer
reckon
on
Eleanor
as
the
companion
of
his
poverty
and
exile
,
 
as
the
sharer
of
his
small
income
.
  
<EOS>
some
modest
provision
for
his
daughter
have
be
long
since
make
.
<EOS>
His
life
be
insure
for
three
thousand
pound
,
and
this
sum
be
to
go
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
for
some
year
past
,
have
pay
the
premium
,
and
have
secure
himself
by
the
immediate
possession
of
a
small
property
which
be
to
have
go
to
Mrs
Grantly
after
her
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
this
matter
,
therefore
,
have
be
take
out
of
the
warden
's
hand
long
since
,
as
,
indeed
,
have
all
the
business
transaction
of
his
family
,
and
his
anxiety
be
,
therefore
,
confine
to
his
own
life
income
.
  
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
a
hundred
and
fifty
per
annum
be
very
small
,
but
still
it
may
suffice
;
but
how
be
he
to
chant
the
litany
at
the
cathedral
on
Sunday
morning
,
and
get
the
service
do
at
Crabtree
Parva
?
<EOS>
true
,
Crabtree
Church
be
not
quite
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cathedral
;
but
he
could
not
be
in
two
place
at
once
.
<EOS>
Crabtree
be
a
small
village
,
and
afternoon
service
may
suffice
,
but
still
this
go
against
his
conscience
;
it
be
not
right
that
his
parishioner
should
be
rob
of
any
of
their
privilege
on
account
of
his
poverty
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
to
be
sure
,
make
some
arrangement
for
do
week
-
day
service
at
the
cathedral
;
but
he
have
chant
the
litany
at
Barchester
so
long
,
and
have
a
conscious
feeling
that
he
do
it
so
well
,
that
he
be
unwilling
to
give
up
the
duty
.
  
<EOS>
think
of
such
thing
,
turn
over
in
his
own
mind
together
small
desire
and
grave
duty
,
but
never
hesitate
for
a
moment
as
to
the
necessity
of
leave
the
hospital
<EOS>
,
Mr
Harding
walk
up
and
down
the
abbey
,
or
sit
still
meditate
on
the
same
stone
step
,
hour
after
hour
.
<EOS>
one
verger
go
and
another
come
,
but
they
do
not
disturb
him
;
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
they
creep
up
and
look
at
him
,
but
they
do
so
with
a
reverential
stare
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
Mr
Harding
find
his
retreat
well
choose
.
<EOS>
about
four
o'clock
his
comfort
be
disturb
by
an
enemy
in
the
shape
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
that
he
should
dine
,
and
it
be
clear
that
he
could
not
dine
in
the
abbey
:
so
he
leave
his
sanctuary
not
willingly
,
and
betook
himself
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Strand
to
look
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
His
eye
have
become
so
accustomed
to
the
gloom
of
the
church
,
that
they
be
daze
when
he
get
out
into
the
full
light
of
day
,
and
he
feel
confused
and
ashamed
of
himself
,
as
though
people
be
stare
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
hurry
along
,
still
in
dread
of
the
archdeacon
,
till
he
come
to
Charing
Cross
,
and
then
remember
that
in
one
of
his
passage
through
the
Strand
he
have
see
the
word
"
Chops
and
Steaks
"
on
a
placard
in
a
shop
window
.
<EOS>
He
remember
the
shop
distinctly
;
it
be
next
door
to
a
trunk
-
seller
's
,
and
there
be
a
cigar
shop
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
to
his
hotel
for
dinner
,
which
to
him
hitherto
<EOS>
be
the
only
know
mode
of
dining
in
London
at
his
own
expense
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
would
get
a
steak
at
the
shop
in
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Archdeacon
Grantly
would
certainly
not
come
to
such
a
place
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
the
house
easily
,
 
just
as
he
have
observe
it
,
between
the
trunk
and
the
cigar
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
daunt
by
the
huge
quantity
of
fish
which
he
see
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
there
be
barrel
of
oyster
,
hecatomb
of
lobster
,
a
few
tremendous
-
look
crab
,
and
a
tub
full
of
pickle
salmon
;
not
,
however
,
be
aware
of
any
connection
between
shell
-
fish
and
iniquity
,
he
enter
,
and
modestly
ask
a
slatternly
woman
,
who
be
pick
oyster
out
of
a
great
watery
reservoir
,
whether
he
could
have
a
mutton
chop
and
a
potato
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
look
somewhat
surprised
,
but
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
and
a
slipshod
girl
usher
him
into
a
long
back
room
,
fill
with
box
for
the
accommodation
of
party
,
in
one
of
which
he
take
his
seat
.
<EOS>
in
a
more
miserably
forlorn
place
he
could
not
have
find
himself
:
the
room
smelt
of
fish
,
and
sawdust
,
and
stale
tobacco
smoke
,
with
a
slight
taint
of
escape
gas
;
everything
be
rough
and
dirty
,
and
disreputable
;
the
cloth
which
they
put
before
him
be
abominable
;
the
knife
and
fork
be
bruise
,
and
hack
,
and
filthy
;
and
everything
be
impregnate
with
fish
.
<EOS>
He
have
one
comfort
,
however
:
he
be
quite
alone
;
there
be
no
one
there
to
look
on
his
dismay
;
nor
be
it
probable
that
anyone
would
come
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
London
supper
-
house
.
<EOS>
about
one
o'clock
at
night
the
place
would
be
lively
enough
,
but
at
the
present
time
his
seclusion
be
as
deep
as
it
have
be
in
the
abbey
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
half
an
hour
the
untidy
girl
,
not
yet
dress
for
her
evening
labour
,
bring
him
his
chop
and
potato
,
and
Mr
Harding
beg
for
a
pint
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
He
be
impressed
with
an
idea
,
which
be
generally
prevalent
a
few
year
since
,
and
be
not
yet
wholly
remove
from
the
mind
of
man
,
that
to
order
a
dinner
at
any
kind
of
inn
,
without
also
order
a
pint
of
wine
for
the
benefit
of
the
landlord
,
be
a
kind
of
fraud
,
 
not
punishable
,
indeed
,
by
law
,
but
not
the
less
abominable
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
remember
his
come
poverty
,
and
would
willingly
have
save
his
half
-
crown
,
but
he
think
he
have
no
alternative
;
and
he
be
soon
put
in
possession
of
some
horrid
mixture
procure
from
the
neighbour
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
His
chop
and
potato
,
however
,
be
eatable
,
and
have
get
over
as
best
<EOS>
he
may
the
disgust
create
by
the
knife
and
fork
,
he
contrive
to
swallow
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
much
disturb
:
<EOS>
one
young
man
,
with
pale
face
and
watery
fishlike
eye
,
wear
his
hat
ominously
on
one
side
,
do
come
in
and
stare
at
him
,
and
ask
the
girl
,
audibly
enough
,
"
who
that
old
cock
be
;
"
but
the
annoyance
go
no
further
,
and
the
warden
be
leave
seated
on
his
wooden
bench
in
peace
,
endeavour
to
distinguish
the
different
scent
arise
from
lobster
,
oyster
,
and
salmon
.
  
<EOS>
unknowing
as
Mr
Harding
be
in
the
way
of
London
<EOS>
,
he
feel
that
he
have
somehow
select
an
ineligible
dining
-
house
,
and
that
he
have
better
leave
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
five
o'clock
;
 
how
be
he
to
pass
the
time
till
ten
?
<EOS>
five
miserable
hour
!
<EOS>
He
be
already
tired
,
and
it
be
impossible
that
he
should
continue
walk
so
long
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
get
into
an
omnibus
,
and
go
out
to
Fulham
for
the
sake
of
come
back
in
another
:
this
,
however
,
would
be
weary
work
,
and
as
he
pay
his
bill
to
the
woman
in
the
shop
,
he
ask
her
if
there
be
any
place
near
where
he
could
get
a
cup
of
coffee
.
<EOS>
though
she
do
keep
a
shellfish
supper
-
house
,
she
be
very
civil
,
and
direct
him
to
the
cigar
divan
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
have
not
a
much
correcter
notion
of
a
cigar
divan
than
he
have
of
a
London
dinner
-
house
,
but
he
be
desperately
in
want
of
rest
,
and
go
as
he
be
direct
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
must
have
make
some
mistake
when
he
find
himself
in
a
cigar
shop
,
but
the
man
behind
the
counter
see
immediately
that
he
be
a
stranger
,
and
understand
what
he
want
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
one
shilling
,
sir
,
 
thank
ye
,
sir
,
 
cigar
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
ticket
for
coffee
,
sir
;
 
<EOS>
you
will
only
have
to
call
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
up
those
stair
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
better
take
the
cigar
,
sir
,
 
you
can
always
give
it
to
a
friend
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
thank
ye
,
sir
;
 
as
you
be
so
good
,
I
will
smoke
it
myself
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
Mr
Harding
ascend
to
the
divan
,
with
his
ticket
for
coffee
,
but
minus
the
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
the
place
seem
much
more
suitable
to
his
requirement
than
the
room
in
which
he
have
dine
:
there
be
,
to
be
sure
,
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
,
to
which
he
be
not
accustom
;
but
after
the
shell
-
fish
,
the
tobacco
do
not
seem
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
there
be
quantity
of
book
,
and
long
row
of
sofa
.
<EOS>
what
on
earth
could
be
more
luxurious
than
a
sofa
,
a
book
,
and
a
cup
of
coffee
?
<EOS>
an
old
waiter
come
up
to
him
,
with
a
couple
of
magazine
and
an
evening
paper
.
<EOS>
be
ever
anything
so
civil
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
a
cup
of
coffee
,
or
would
he
prefer
sherbet
?
<EOS>
Sherbet
!
<EOS>
be
he
absolutely
in
an
eastern
divan
,
with
the
slight
addition
of
all
the
London
periodical
?
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
an
idea
that
sherbet
should
be
drunk
sit
cross
-
legged
,
and
as
he
be
not
quite
up
to
this
,
he
order
the
coffee
.
  
<EOS>
the
coffee
come
,
and
be
unexceptionable
.
<EOS>
why
,
this
divan
be
a
paradise
!
<EOS>
the
civil
old
waiter
suggest
to
him
a
game
of
chess
:
though
a
chess
player
he
be
not
equal
to
this
,
so
he
decline
,
and
,
put
up
his
weary
leg
on
the
sofa
,
leisurely
sip
his
coffee
,
and
turn
over
the
page
of
his
Blackwood
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
so
engage
for
about
an
hour
,
for
the
old
waiter
<EOS>
entice
him
to
a
second
cup
of
coffee
,
when
a
musical
clock
begin
to
play
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
then
close
his
magazine
,
keep
his
place
with
his
finger
,
and
lie
,
listen
with
close
eye
to
the
clock
.
<EOS>
soon
the
clock
seem
to
turn
into
a
violoncello
,
with
piano
accompaniment
,
and
Mr
Harding
begin
to
fancy
the
old
waiter
<EOS>
be
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
he
be
inexpressibly
shock
that
the
bishop
should
have
bring
him
his
coffee
with
his
own
hand
;
then
Dr
Grantly
come
in
,
with
a
basket
full
of
lobster
,
which
he
would
not
be
induce
to
leave
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
;
and
then
the
warden
could
not
quite
understand
why
so
many
people
would
smoke
in
the
bishop
's
drawing
-
room
;
and
so
he
fall
fast
asleep
,
and
his
dream
wander
away
to
his
accustomed
stall
in
Barchester
Cathedral
,
and
the
twelve
old
man
he
be
so
soon
about
to
leave
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
fatigue
,
and
sleep
soundly
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
some
sudden
stop
in
the
musical
clock
wake
him
at
length
,
and
he
jump
up
with
a
start
,
surprised
to
find
the
room
quite
full
:
it
have
be
nearly
empty
when
his
nap
begin
.
<EOS>
with
nervous
anxiety
he
pull
out
his
watch
,
and
find
that
it
be
half
-
past
nine
.
<EOS>
He
seize
his
hat
,
and
,
hurry
downstairs
,
start
at
a
rapid
pace
for
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
It
still
want
twenty
minute
to
ten
when
the
warden
find
himself
at
the
bottom
of
Sir
Abraham
's
stair
,
so
he
walk
leisurely
up
and
down
the
quiet
inn
to
cool
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
evening
at
the
end
of
August
.
<EOS>
He
have
recover
from
his
fatigue
;
his
sleep
and
the
coffee
have
refresh
him
,
and
he
be
surprised
to
find
that
he
be
absolutely
enjoy
himself
,
when
the
inn
clock
strike
ten
.
<EOS>
the
sound
be
hardly
over
before
he
knock
at
Sir
Abraham
's
door
,
and
be
inform
by
the
clerk
who
receive
him
that
the
great
man
would
be
with
him
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
SIR
ABRAHAM
haphazard
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
show
into
a
comfortable
inner
sitting
-
room
,
look
more
like
a
gentleman
's
book
-
room
than
a
lawyer
's
chamber
,
and
there
wait
for
Sir
Abraham
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
keep
wait
long
:
in
ten
or
fifteen
minute
he
hear
a
clatter
of
voice
speak
quickly
in
the
passage
,
and
then
the
attorney
-
general
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
sorry
to
keep
you
wait
,
Mr
Warden
,
"
say
Sir
Abraham
,
shake
hand
with
him
;
"
and
sorry
,
too
,
to
name
so
disagreeable
an
hour
;
but
your
notice
be
short
,
and
as
you
say
to
-
day
,
I
name
the
very
early
hour
that
be
not
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
assure
him
that
he
be
aware
that
it
be
he
that
should
apologise
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
be
a
tall
thin
man
,
with
hair
prematurely
gray
,
but
bear
no
other
sign
of
age
;
he
have
a
slight
stoop
,
in
his
neck
rather
than
his
back
,
acquire
by
his
constant
habit
of
lean
forward
as
he
address
his
various
audience
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
fifty
year
old
,
and
would
have
look
young
for
his
age
,
have
not
constant
work
harden
his
feature
,
and
give
him
the
appearance
of
a
machine
with
a
mind
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
full
of
intellect
,
but
devoid
of
natural
expression
.
<EOS>
You
would
say
he
be
a
man
to
use
,
and
then
have
do
with
;
a
man
to
be
seek
for
on
great
emergency
,
but
ill
-
adapt
for
ordinary
service
;
a
man
whom
you
would
ask
to
defend
your
property
,
but
to
whom
you
would
be
sorry
to
confide
your
love
.
<EOS>
He
be
bright
as
a
diamond
,
and
as
cut
,
and
also
as
unimpressionable
.
<EOS>
He
know
everyone
whom
to
know
be
an
honour
,
but
he
be
without
a
friend
;
he
want
none
,
however
,
and
know
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
other
than
its
parliamentary
sense
.
<EOS>
a
friend
!
<EOS>
have
he
not
always
be
sufficient
to
himself
,
and
now
,
at
fifty
,
be
it
likely
that
he
should
trust
another
?
<EOS>
He
be
married
,
indeed
,
and
have
child
,
but
what
time
have
he
for
the
soft
idleness
of
conjugal
felicity
?
<EOS>
His
working
day
or
term
time
be
occupy
from
his
time
of
rise
to
the
late
hour
at
which
he
go
to
rest
,
and
even
his
vacation
be
more
full
of
labour
than
the
busy
day
of
other
man
.
<EOS>
He
never
quarrel
with
his
wife
,
but
he
never
talk
to
her
;
 
he
never
have
time
to
talk
,
he
be
so
take
up
with
speak
.
<EOS>
She
,
poor
lady
,
be
not
unhappy
;
she
have
all
that
money
could
give
her
,
she
would
probably
live
to
be
a
peeress
,
and
she
really
think
Sir
Abraham
the
good
of
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
be
a
man
of
wit
,
and
sparkle
among
the
bright
at
the
dinner
-
table
of
political
grandee
:
indeed
,
he
always
sparkle
;
whether
in
society
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
or
the
court
of
law
,
coruscation
fly
from
him
;
glitter
sparkle
,
as
from
hot
steel
,
but
no
heat
;
no
cold
heart
be
ever
cheer
by
warmth
from
him
,
no
unhappy
soul
ever
drop
a
portion
of
its
burden
at
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
with
him
success
alone
be
praiseworthy
,
and
he
know
none
so
successful
as
himself
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
thrust
him
forward
;
no
powerful
friend
have
push
him
along
on
his
road
to
power
.
<EOS>
no
;
he
be
attorney
-
general
,
and
would
,
in
all
human
probability
,
be
lord
chancellor
by
sheer
dint
of
his
own
industry
and
his
own
talent
.
<EOS>
who
else
in
all
the
world
rise
so
high
with
so
little
help
?
<EOS>
a
premier
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
who
have
ever
be
premier
without
mighty
friend
?
<EOS>
an
archbishop
!
<EOS>
yes
,
the
son
or
grandson
of
a
great
noble
,
or
else
,
probably
,
his
tutor
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
Sir
Abraham
,
have
have
no
mighty
lord
at
his
back
;
his
father
have
be
a
country
apothecary
,
his
mother
a
farmer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
respect
any
but
himself
?
<EOS>
and
so
he
glitter
along
through
the
world
,
the
bright
among
the
bright
;
and
when
his
glitter
be
go
,
and
he
be
gather
to
his
father
,
no
eye
will
be
dim
with
a
tear
<EOS>
,
no
heart

Mr

<EOS>
Mr
Harding
say
he
hope
so

he
do
not
at
all
understand
what
Sir
Abraham
mean
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
,
with
all
his
sharpness

could
not

look
into
his

read
his
intention

all
over

<EOS>
You
need
trouble
yourself
no
further
about
it

of
course
they
must
pay
the
cost
,
and
the
absolute
expense
to
you

I

do
not
you
know
that
their
attorney
have
notice
us
that

<EOS>
Mr
Harding
explain
to
the
lawyer
that
he
know
nothing
of
this
,
although
he
have
hear
in
a
roundabout
way
that
such
an
intention
have
be
talk
of
;
and
he
also
at
length
succeed
in
make
Sir
Abraham
understand
that
even
this
do
not
satisfy
him

<EOS>
the
attorney

up
,
put
his
hand
into
his
breech

pocket

raise
his
eyebrow

as
Mr
Harding
proceed
to
detail
the
grievance
from
which
he
now
wish
to
rid
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
no
right
to
trouble
you
personally
with
this

it

most
vital
importance
to
me

as
all
my

I

your

<EOS>
Sir

his
client

the
good
advice

could
give
them

a
client
so
respectable
in
every
way

the
Warden

Barchester
Hospital

<EOS>
"
a
spoken
word

Sir
Abraham

often
of
more
value
than
volume
of

advice

<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
be
ill
-
satisfied
with
this
matter
as
it
stand
at
present

<EOS>
I
do
see
 
I
can
not

that
the

me

be
this

be
I

legally

<EOS>
Sir

and
end
in
express
a
strong
opinion

it

continue
the

there

this

into
such
an
act

extreme
weakness

be
to
Sir

so
contemptible
an
object

Would
not
it
be

to

any
serious

you
can
consult
with
him

"
  
<EOS>
Mr

declare
vehemently
that
he
could
not
wait

and
Sir
Abraham
begin
seriously
to
doubt
his
sanity

<EOS>
"
of
course

the
latter
,

if

Mr

how
do
you
mean

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
proceed
to
explain
to
the
man
of
law
that
he
mean
to
keep
his
precentorship
,
 
that
be
eighty
pound
a
year
;
and
,
also
,
that
he
mean
to
fall
back
upon
his
own
little
living
of
Crabtree
,
which
be
another
eighty
pound
.
<EOS>
that
,
to
be
sure
,
the
duty
of
the
two
be
hardly
compatible
;
but
perhaps
he
may
effect
an
exchange
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
recollect
that
the
attorney
-
general
would
hardly
care
to
hear
how
the
service
of
a
cathedral
church
be
divide
among
the
minor
canon
,
stop
short
in
his
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
listen
in
pity
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
,
Mr
Harding
,
you
have
well
wait
for
the
archdeacon

<EOS>
this
be
a
most
serious
step
,
 
one
for
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
there
be
not
the
slight
necessity
;
and
,
as
you
have
do
me
the
honour
of
ask
my
advice
,
I
must
implore
you
to
do
nothing
without
the
approval
of
your
friend

man
be
never

"
a
man
be
the
good
judge

what
he
feel
himself

<EOS>
I
would
sooner
beg
my
bread
till
my
death
than
read
such
another
article
as
those
two
that
have
appear

feel

as
I
do

that
the
writer
have
truth

you
not

an

now
stand
also

still

away

his
hand
behind
his

I
have

Sir

subject

"
pray
excuse
me
,
Mr
Harding

if
what
I
say
seem
impertinent

surely
it
be
you
that
should
be
prudent
on
her
behalf

<EOS>
She
be
young
,
and
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
live
on
an
income
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
on
her
account
give
up
this
idea

believe
me

it
be
sheer
Quixotism

warden
walk
away
to
the
window

then
back
to
his
chair
;
and
then
,
irresolute
what
to
say
,
take
another
turn
to
the
window

<EOS>
the
attorney
-
general
be
really
extremely
patient
,
but
he
be
begin
to
think
that
the
interview
have
be
long
enough

<EOS>
"
but
if
this
income
be
not
justly
mine
,
what
if
she
and
I
have
both
to
beg
?
"
say
the
warden
at
last
,
sharply
,
and
in
a
voice
so
different
from
that
he
have
hitherto
use
,
that
Sir
Abraham
be
startle
.
<EOS>
"
if
so
,
it
would
be
well
to
beg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
nobody
now
question
its
justness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Sir
Abraham
,
one
do
question
it
,
 
the
most
important
of
all
witness
against
me
;
 
I
question
it
myself
.
<EOS>
My
God
know
whether
or
no
I
love
my
daughter
;
but
I
would
sooner
that
she
and
I
should
both
beg
,
than
that
she
should
live
in
comfort
on
money
which
be
truly
the
property
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
to
you
,
Sir
Abraham
,
it
be
strange
to
myself
,
that
I
should
have
be
ten
year
in
that
happy
home
,
and
not
have
think
of
these
thing
till
they
be
so
roughly
din
into
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
boast
of
my
conscience
,
when
it
require
the
violence
of
a
public
newspaper
to
awaken
it
;
but
,
now
that
it
be
awake
,
I
must
obey
it
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
here
,
I
do
not
know
that
the
suit
be
withdraw
by
Mr
Bold
,
and
my
object
be
to
beg
you
to
abandon
my
defence
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
action
,
there
can
be
no
defence
;
but
it
be
,
at
any
rate
,
as
well
that
you
should
know
that
from
to
-
morrow
I
shall
cease
to
be
the
warden
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
My
friend
and
I
differ
on
this
subject
,
Sir
Abraham
,
and
that
add
much
to
my
sorrow
;
but
it
can
not
be
help
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
finish
what
he
have
to
say
,
he
play
up
such
a
tune
as
never
before
have
grace
the
chamber
of
any
attorney
-
general
.
<EOS>
He
be
stand
up
,
gallantly
front
Sir
Abraham
,
and
his
right
arm
pass
with
bold
and
rapid
sweep
before
him
,
as
though
he
be
embrace
some
huge
instrument
,
which
allow
him
to
stand
thus
erect
;
and
with
the
finger
of
his
left
hand
he
stop
,
with
preternatural
velocity
,
a
multitude
of
string
,
which
range
from
the
top
of
his
collar
to
the
bottom
of
the
lappet
of
his
coat
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
listen
and
look
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
never
before
see
Mr
Harding
,
the
meaning
of
these
wild
gesticulation
be
lose
upon
him
;
but
he
perceive
that
the
gentleman
who
have
a
few
minute
since
be
so
subdue
as
to
be
unable
to
speak
without
hesitation
,
be
now
impassione
,
 
nay
,
almost
violent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
sleep
on
this
,
Mr
Harding
,
and
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
do
more
than
sleep
upon
it
,
"
say
the
warden
;
"
I
have
lie
awake
upon
it
,
and
that
night
after
night
.
<EOS>
I
find
I
could
not
sleep
upon
it
:
now
I
hope
to
do
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
attorney
-
general
have
no
answer
to
make
to
this
;
so
he
express
a
quiet
hope
that
whatever
settlement
be
finally
make
would
be
satisfactory
;
and
Mr
Harding
withdraw
,
thank
the
great
man
for
his
kind
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
sufficiently
satisfied
with
the
interview
to
feel
a
glow
of
comfort
as
he
descend
into
the
small
old
square
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
calm
,
bright
,
beautiful
night
,
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
even
the
chapel
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
and
the
sombre
row
of
chamber
,
which
surround
the
quadrangle
,
look
well
.
<EOS>
He
stand
still
a
moment
to
collect
his
thought
,
and
reflect
on
what
he
have
do
,
and
be
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
attorney
-
general
regard
him
as
little
well
than
a
fool
,
but
that
he
do
not
mind
;
he
and
the
attorney
-
general
have
not
much
in
common
between
them
;
he
know
also
that
other
,
whom
he
do
care
about
,
would
think
so
too
;
but
Eleanor
,
he
be
sure
,
would
exult
in
what
he
have
do
,
and
the
bishop
,
he
trust
,
would
sympathise
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
he
have
to
meet
the
archdeacon
,
and
so
he
walk
slowly
down
Chancery
Lane
and
along
Fleet
Street
,
feel
sure
that
his
work
for
the
night
be
not
yet
over
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
the
hotel
he
ring
the
bell
quietly
,
and
with
a
palpitate
heart
;
he
almost
long
to
escape
round
the
corner
,
and
delay
the
come
storm
by
a
further
walk
round
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
but
he
hear
the
slow
creaking
shoe
of
the
old
waiter
approach
,
and
he
stand
his
ground
manfully
.
   
<EOS>
the
warden
be
very
obstinate
 
<EOS>
"
Dr
Grantly
be
here
,
sir

"
greet
his
ear
before
the
door
be
well
open
,

and
Mrs
Grantly
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
sit
-
room
above
,
and
be
wait
up
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
tone
of
the
man
's
voice
which
seem
to
indicate
that
even
he
look
upon
the
warden
as
a
runaway
schoolboy
,
just
recapture
by
his
guardian
,
and
that
he
pity
the
culprit
,
though
he
could
not
but
be
horrify
at
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
the
warden
endeavour
to
appear
unconcerned
,
as
he
say
,
"
oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
upstairs
at
once
;
"
but
he
fail
signally
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
perhaps
,
a
ray
of
comfort
in
the
presence
of
his
married
daughter
;
that
be
to
say
,
of
comparative
comfort
,
see
that
his
son
-
in
-
law
be
there
;
but
how
much
would
he
have
prefer
that
they
should
both
have
be
safe
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
!
<EOS>
however
,
upstairs
he
go
,
the
waiter
slowly
precede
him
;
and
on
the
door
be
open
the
archdeacon
be
discover
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
erect
,
indeed
,
as
usual
,
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
sorrowful
!
<EOS>
and
on
the
dingy
sofa
behind
him
recline
his
patient
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
I
think
you
be
never
come
back
,

say
the
lady
;
"
it
be
twelve
o'clock

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
attorney

general
name
ten
for
my
meeting

to
be
sure
ten
be
late

but
what
could
I
do
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
great
man
will
have
their
own
way

"
  
<EOS>
and
he
give
his
daughter
a
kiss
,

he

weak
enough
to
give
way
now

his

Mr

<EOS>
the
archdeacon
think
he
know
his
father

he

mistaken

he

have
already
talk

the

look
at

think
probably
at
the
moment
that
if
Eleanor
be
content
with
him

he
need
not
so
much
regard
his
other
child

say
,

<EOS>
a

generally
dislike
to

he
feel
as
affront
as

do

when
recommend
by

only
of
get

calculate
whether

You

It

<EOS>
the
name
of
Cox

what

<EOS>
the
archdeacon
could
go
to
Cox

could
remain
there
all

CHAPTER
HOTEL

ST
.
<EOS>
PAUL
's
,
LONDON
,
August
,
18
    
My
LORD
BISHOP
,
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
the
great
pain
that
I
feel
myself
constrained
to
resign
into
your
lordship
's
hand
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
at
Barchester
,
which
you
so
kindly
confer
upon
me
,
now
nearly
twelve
year
since
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
explain
the
circumstance
which
have
make
this
step
appear
necessary
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
a
question
have
arise
as
to
the
right
of
the
warden
to
the
income
which
have
be
allot
to
the
wardenship
;
it
have
seem
to
me
that
this
right
be
not
well
make
out
,
and
I
hesitate
to
incur
the
risk
of
take
an
income
to
which
my
legal
claim
appear
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
the
office
of
precentor
of
the
cathedral
be
,
as
your
lordship
be
aware
,
join
to
that
of
the
warden
<EOS>
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
precentor
have
for
many
year
be
the
warden
of
the
hospital
;
there
be
,
however
,
nothing
to
make
the
junction
of
the
two
office
necessary
,
and
,
unless
you
or
the
dean
and
chapter
object
to
such
an
arrangement
,
I
would
wish
to
keep
the
precentorship
.
<EOS>
the
income
of
this
office
will
now
be
necessary
to
me
;
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
be
ashamed
to
say
that
I
should
have
difficulty
in
support
myself
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
Your
lordship
,
and
such
other
as
you
may
please
to
consult
on
the
matter
,
will
at
once
see
that
my
resignation
of
the
wardenship
nee
offer
not
the
slight
bar
to
its
occupation
by
another
person
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
in
the
wrong
by
all
those
whom
I
have
consult
in
the
matter
;
I
have
very
little
but
an
inward
and
an
unguided
conviction
of
my
own
to
bring
me
to
this
step
,
and
I
shall
,
indeed
,
be
hurt
to
find
that
any
slur
be
throw
on
the
preferment
which
your
kindness
bestow
on
me
,
by
my
resignation
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
any
rate
for
one
,
shall
look
on
any
successor
whom
you
may
appoint
as
enjoy
a
clerical
situation
of
the
high
respectability
,
and
one
to
which
your
lordship
's
nomination
give
an
indefeasible
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
finish
this
official
letter
without
again
thank
your
lordship
for
all
your
great
kindness
,
and
I
beg
to
subscribe
myself
    
<EOS>
Your
lordship
's
most
obedient
servant
,
  
SEPTIMUS
HARDING
,
  
Warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
,
and
Precentor
of
the
Cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
write
the
follow
private
note
:
    
My
dear
bishop
,
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
send
you
the
accompanying
official
letter
without
a
warm
expression
of
thank
for
all
your
kindness
than
would
befit
a
document
which
may
to
a
certain
degree
be
make
public
.
<EOS>
You
,
I
know
,
will
understand
the
feeling
,
and
,
perhaps
,
pity
the
weakness
which
make
me
resign
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
make
of
calibre
strong
enough
to
withstand
public
attack
.
<EOS>
be
I
convinced
that
I
stand
on
ground
perfectly
firm
,
that
I
be
certainly
justify
in
take
eight
hundred
a
year
under
Hiram
's
will
<EOS>
,
I
should
feel
bind
by
duty
to
retain
the
position
,
however
unendurable
may
be
the
nature
of
the
assault
;
but
,
as
I
do
not
feel
this
conviction
,
I
can
not
believe
that
you
will
think
me
wrong
in
what
I
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
at
one
time
an
idea
of
keep
only
some
moderate
portion
of
the
income
;
perhaps
three
hundred
a
year
,
and
of
remit
the
remainder
to
the
trustee
;
but
it
occur
to
me
,
and
I
think
with
reason
,
that
by
so
do
I
should
place
my
successor
in
an
invidious
position
,
and
greatly
damage
your
patronage
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
let
me
have
a
line
from
you
to
say
that
you
do
not
blame
me
for
what
I
be
do
,
and
that
the
officiating
vicar
of
Crabtree
Parva
will
be
the
same
to
you
as
the
warden
of
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
anxious
about
the
precentorship
:
the
archdeacon
think
it
must
go
with
the
wardenship
;
I
think
not
,
and
,
that
,
have
it
,
I
can
not
be
oust
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
however
,
be
guide
by
you
and
the
dean
.
<EOS>
no
other
duty
will
suit
me
so
well
,
or
come
so
much
within
my
power
of
adequate
performance
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
the
preferment
which
I
be
now
give
up
,
and
for
all
your
kindness
,
and
be
,
dear
bishop
,
now
as
always
    
Yours
most
sincerely

have
he
not
be
supremely
successful
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
hold
his
own
purpose
against
that
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
manfully
combat
against
great
odd
,
 
against
the
archdeacon
's
wife
as
well
as
the
archdeacon
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
gain
a
great
victory
,
and
be
it
not
fit
that
he
should
step
into
his
cab
with
triumph
?
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
tell
Eleanor
when
he
would
return
,
but
she
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
by
every
train
by
which
he
could
arrive
,
and
the
pony
-
carriage
be
at
the
Barchester
station
when
the
train
draw
up
at
the
platform
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
sit
beside
her
,
as
she
steer
her
little
vessel
to
one
side
of
the
road
to
make
room
for
the
clatter
omnibus
as
they
pass
from
the
station
into
the
town
,
"
I
hope
you
will
be
able
to
feel
a
proper
degree
of
respect
for
the
vicar
of
Crabtree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
papa
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
so
glad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
great
comfort
in
return
home
to
that
pleasant
house
,
though
he
be
to
leave
it
so
soon
,
and
in
discuss
with
his
daughter
all
that
he
have
do
,
and
all
that
he
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
must
take
some
time
to
get
out
of
one
house
into
another
;
the
curate
at
Crabtree
could
not
be
abolish
under
six
month
,
that
is
,
unless
other
provision
could
be
make
for
him
;
and
then
the
furniture
:
 
the
most
of
that
must
be
sell
to
pay
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
for
sit
up
till
twelve
at
night
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
strangely
ignorant
as
to
lawyer
'
bill
;
he
have
no
idea
,
from
twenty
pound
to
two
thousand
,
as
to
the
sum
in
which
he
be
indebte
for
legal
assistance
.
<EOS>
true
,
he
have
call
in
no
lawyer
himself
;
true
,
he
have
be
no
consent
party
to
the
employment
of
either
Cox
and
Cummins
,
or
Sir
Abraham
;
he
have
never
be
consult
on
such
matter
;
 
the
archdeacon
have
manage
all
this
himself
,
never
for
a
moment
suspect
that
Mr
Harding
would
take
upon
him
to
end
the
matter
in
a
way
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
have
the
lawyer
'
bill
been
ten
thousand
pound
,
Mr
Harding
could
not
have
help
it
;
but
he
be
not
on
that
account
dispose
to
dispute
his
own
liability
.
<EOS>
the
question
never
occur
to
him
;
but
it
do
occur
to
him
that
he
have
very
little
money
at
his
banker
's
,
that
he
could
receive
nothing
further
from
the
hospital
,
and
that
the
sale
of
the
furniture
be
his
only
resource
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
all
,
papa
,
"
say
Eleanor
pleadingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
all
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
;
"
that
be
,
if
we
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
a
little
at
Crabtree
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
can
only
be
a
little
;
we
must
put
a
bold
front
on
it
,
nelly
;
it
be
not
easy
to
come
down
from
affluence
to
poverty
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
they
plan
their
future
mode
of
life
;
the
father
take
comfort
from
the
reflection
that
his
daughter
would
soon
be
free
from
it
,
and
she
resolve
that
her
father
would
soon
have
in
her
own
house
a
ready
mean
of
escape
from
the
solitude
of
the
Crabtree
vicarage
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
archdeacon
leave
his
wife
and
father
-
in
-
law
at
the
Chapter
Coffee
House
to
go
to
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
he
have
no
very
define
idea
of
what
he
have
to
do
when
he
get
there
.
<EOS>
gentleman
when
at
law
,
or
in
any
way
engage
in
matter
require
legal
assistance
,
be
very
apt
to
go
to
their
lawyer
without
much
absolute
necessity
;
 
gentleman
when
do
so
,
be
apt
to
describe
such
attendance
as
quite
compulsory
,
and
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
,
on
the
other
hand
,
do
not
at
all
see
the
necessity
,
though
they
quite
agree
as
to
the
disagreeable
nature
of
the
visit
;
 
gentleman
when
so
engaged
be
usually
somewhat
gravel
at
find
nothing
to
say
to
their
learned
friend
;
they
generally
talk
a
little
politic
,
a
little
weather
,
ask
some
few
foolish
question
about
their
suit
,
and
then
withdraw
,
have
pass
half
an
hour
in
a
small
dingy
wait
-
room
,
in
company
with
some
junior
assistant
-
clerk
,
and
ten
minute
with
the
member
of
the
firm
;
the
business
be
then
over
for
which
the
gentleman
have
come
up
to
London
,
probably
a
distance
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
mile
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
go
to
the
play
,
and
dine
at
his
friend
's
club
,
and
have
a
bachelor
's
liberty
and
bachelor
's
recreation
for
three
or
four
day
;
and
he
could
not
probably
plead
the
desire
of
such
gratification
as
a
reason
to
his
wife
for
a
trip
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
married
lady
,
when
your
husband
find
they
be
positively
oblige
to
attend
their
legal
adviser
,
the
nature
of
the
duty
to
be
perform
be
generally
of
this
description
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
would
not
have
dreamt
of
leave
London
without
go
to
Cox
and
Cummins
;
and
yet
he
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
game
be
up
;
he
plainly
see
that
Mr
Harding
in
this
matter
be
not
to
be
move
;
his
only
remain
business
on
this
head
be
to
pay
the
bill
and
have
do
with
it
;
and
I
think
it
may
be
take
for
grant
,
that
whatever
the
cause
may
be
that
take
a
gentleman
to
a
lawyer
's
chamber
,
he
never
go
there
to
pay
his
bill
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
<EOS>
grantly
,
however
,
in
the
eye
of
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
represent
the
spirituality
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
,
as
Mr
Chadwick
do
the
temporality
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
too
great
a
man
to
undergo
the
half
-
hour
in
the
clerk
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
necessary
that
we
should
listen
to
the
note
of
sorrow
in
which
the
archdeacon
bewail
to
Mr
Cox
the
weakness
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
the
end
of
all
their
hope
of
triumph
;
nor
need
we
repeat
the
various
exclamation
of
surprise
with
which
the
mournful
intelligence
be
receive
.
<EOS>
no
tragedy
occur
,
though
Mr
Cox
,
a
short
and
somewhat
bull
-
necked
man
,
be
very
near
a
fit
of
apoplexy
when
he
first
attempt
to
ejaculate
that
fatal
word
 
resign
!
  
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
do
Mr
Cox
attempt
to
enforce
on
the
archdeacon
the
propriety
of
urge
on
Mr
Warden
the
madness
of
the
deed
he
be
about
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
eight

"

Mr

in

shake

may

<EOS>
the
archdeacon
take
up
his
hat

the
matter
over
deeply

at

FAREWELL
 
<EOS>
on
the
morning
after
Mr
Harding
's
return
home
he
receive
a
note
from
the
bishop
full
of
affection
,
condolence
,
and
praise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pray
come
to
me
at
once
,
"
write
the
bishop
,
"
that
we
may
see
what
have
better
be
do
;
as
to
the
hospital
,
I
will
not
say
a
word
to
dissuade
you
;
but
I
do
not
like
your
go
to
Crabtree
:
at
any
rate
,
come
to
me
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
do
go
to
him
at
once
;
and
long
and
confidential
be
the
consultation
between
the
two
old
friend
.
<EOS>
there
they
sit
together
the
whole
long
day
,
plot
to
get
the
well
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
to
carry
out
little
scheme
of
their
own
,
which
they
know
would
be
oppose
by
the
whole
weight
of
his
authority
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
's
first
idea
be
,
that
Mr
Harding
,
if
leave
to
himself
,
would
certainly
starve
,
 
not
in
the
figurative
sense
in
which
so
many
of
our
lady
and
gentleman
do
starve
on
income
from
one
to
five
hundred
a
year
;
not
that
he
would
be
starve
as
regard
dress
coat
,
port
wine
,
and
pocket
-
money
;
but
that
he
would
positively
perish
of
inanition
for
want
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
a
man
to
live
,
when
he
give
up
all
his
income
?
"
say
the
bishop
to
himself
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
good
-
natured
little
man
begin
to
consider
how
his
friend
may
be
best
rescue
from
a
death
so
horrid
and
painful
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
proposition
to
Mr
Harding
be
,
that
they
should
live
together
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
He
,
the
bishop
,
positively
assure
Mr
Harding
that
he
want
another
resident
chaplain
,
 
not
a
young
working
chaplain
,
but
a
steady
,
middle
-
aged
chaplain
;
one
who
would
dine
and
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
,
talk
about
the
archdeacon
,
and
poke
the
fire
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
do
not
positively
name
all
these
duty
,
but
he
give
Mr
Harding
to
understand
that
such
would
be
the
nature
of
the
service
require
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
much
difficulty
that
Mr
Harding
make
his
friend
see
that
this
would
not
suit
him
;
that
he
could
not
throw
up
the
bishop
's
preferment
,
and
then
come
and
hang
on
at
the
bishop
's
table
;
that
he
could
not
allow
people
to
say
of
him
that
it
be
an
easy
matter
to
abandon
his
own
income
,
as
he
be
able
to
sponge
on
that
of
another
person
.
<EOS>
He
succeed
,
however
,
in
explain
that
the
plan
would
not
do
,
and
then
the
bishop
bring
forward
another
which
he
have
in
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
He
,
the
bishop
,
have
in
his
will
leave
certain
money
to
Mr
Harding
's
two
daughter
,
imagine
that
Mr
Harding
would
himself
want
no
such
assistance
during
his
own
lifetime
.
<EOS>
this
legacy
amount
to
three
thousand
pound
each
,
duty
free
;
and
he
now
press
it
as
a
gift
on
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
girl
,
you
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
will
have
it
just
the
same
when
you
be
go
,
 
and
they
will
not
want
it
sooner
;
 
and
as
for
the
interest
during
my
lifetime
,
it
be
not
worth
talk
about
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
much
difficulty
and
heartfelt
sorrow
,
Mr
Harding
refuse
also
this
offer
.
<EOS>
no
;
his
wish
be
to
support
himself
,
however
poorly
,
 
not
to
be
support
on
the
charity
of
anyone
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
make
the
bishop
understand
this
;
it
be
hard
to
make
him
comprehend
that
the
only
real
favour
he
could
confer
be
the
continuation
of
his
independent
friendship
;
but
at
last
even
this
be
do
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
think
the
bishop
,
he
will
come
and
dine
with
me
from
time
to
time
,
and
if
he
be
absolutely
starve
I
shall
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
touch
the
precentorship
,
the
bishop
be
clearly
of
opinion
that
it
could
be
hold
without
the
other
situation
,
 
an
opinion
from
which
no
one
differ
;
and
it
be
therefore
soon
settle
among
all
the
party
concern
,
that
Mr
Harding
should
still
be
the
precentor
of
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
follow
Mr
Harding
's
return
,
the
archdeacon
reach
plumstead
full
of
Mr
Cummins
's
scheme
regard
Puddingdale
and
Mr
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
next
morning
he
drive
over
to
Puddingdale
,
and
obtain
the
full
consent
of
the
wretched
clerical
Priam
,
who
be
endeavour
to
feed
his
poor
Hecuba
and
a
dozen
of
Hectors
on
the
small
proceed
of
his
ecclesiastical
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Mr
Quiverful
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
legal
right
of
the
warden
;
his
conscience
would
be
quite
clear
as
to
accept
the
income
;
and
as
to
_
the
Jupiter
_
,
he
beg
to
assure
the
archdeacon
that
he
be
quite
indifferent
to
any
emanation
from
the
profane
portion
of
the
periodical
press
.
  
<EOS>
have
so
far
succeed
,
he
next
sound
the
bishop
;
but
here
he
be
astonish
by
most
unexpected
resistance
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
do
not
think
it
would
do
.
"
<EOS>
not
do
,
why
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
see
that
his
father
be
not
shake
,
he
repeat
the
question
in
a
severer
form
:
"
<EOS>
why
not
do
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
look
very
unhappy
,
and
shuffle
about
in
his
chair
,
but
still
do
not
give
way
;
he
think
Puddingdale
would
not
do
for
Mr
Harding
;
it
be
too
far
from
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
of
course
he
will
have
a
curate
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
also
think
that
Mr
Quiverful
would
not
do
for
the
hospital
;
such
an
exchange
would
not
look
well
at
such
a
time
;
and
,
when
press
harder
,
he
declare
he
do
not
think
Mr
Harding
would
accept
of
Puddingdale
under
any
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
he
to
live
?
<EOS>
"
demand
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
declare
that
he
have
not
the
slight
conception
how
life
be
to
be
sustain
within
him
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
then
leave
his
father
,
and
go
down
to
the
hospital
;
but
Mr
Harding
would
not
listen
at
all
to
the
Puddingdale
scheme
.
<EOS>
to
his
eye
it
have
no
attraction
;
it
savour
of
simony
,
and
be
likely
to
bring
down
upon
him
harder
and
more
deserved
stricture
than
any
he
have
yet
receive
:
he
positively
decline
to
become
vicar
of
Puddingdale
under
any
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
wax
wroth
,
talk
big
,
and
look
big
;
he
say
something
about
dependence
and
beggary
,
speak
of
the
duty
every
man
be
under
to
earn
his
bread
,
make
pass
allusion
to
the
folly
of
youth
and
waywardness
of
age
,
as
though
Mr
Harding
be
afflict
by
both
,
and
end
by
declare
that
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
have
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
arrange
matter
on
the
good
and
easy
footing
;
that
he
have
,
in
fact
,
so
arrange
them
,
that
he
have
so
manage
that
there
be
no
further
need
of
any
anxiety
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
and
how
have
he
be
pay
?
<EOS>
His
advice
have
be
systematically
reject
;
he
have
be
not
only
slight
,
but
distrust
and
avoid
;
he
and
his
measure
have
be
utterly
throw
over
,
as
have
be
Sir
Abraham
,
who
,
he
have
reason
to
know
,
be
much
pain
at
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
He
now
find
it
be
useless
to
interfere
any
further
,
and
he
should
retire
.
<EOS>
if
any
further
assistance
be
require
from
him
,
he
would
probably
be
call
on
,
and
should
be
again
happy
to
come
forward
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
leave
the
hospital
,
and
have
not
since
enter
it
from
that
day
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
we
must
take
leave
of
Archdeacon
Grantly
.
<EOS>
We
fear
that
he
be
represent
in
these
page
as
be
bad
than
he
be
;
but
we
have
have
to
do
with
his
foible
,
and
not
with
his
virtue
.
<EOS>
We
have
see
only
the
weak
side
of
the
man
,
and
have
lack
the
opportunity
of
bring
him
forward
on
his
strong
ground
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
a
man
somewhat
too
fond
of
his
own
way
,
and
not
sufficiently
scrupulous
in
his
manner
of
achieve
it
,
his
good
friend
can
not
deny
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
bigote
in
favour
,
not
so
much
of
his
doctrine
as
of
his
cloth
,
be
also
true
:
and
it
be
true
that
the
possession
of
a
large
income
be
a
desire
that
sit
near
his
heart
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
archdeacon
be
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
conscience
;
he
spend
his
money
liberally
,
and
do
the
work
he
have
to
do
with
the
good
of
his
ability
;
he
improve
the
tone
of
society
of
those
among
whom
he
live
.
<EOS>
His
aspiration
be
of
a
healthy
,
if
not
of
the
high
,
kind
.
<EOS>
though
never
an
austere
man
,
he
uphold
propriety
of
conduct
both
by
example
and
precept
.
<EOS>
He
be
generous
to
the
poor
,
and
hospitable
to
the
rich
;
in
matter
of
religion
he
be
sincere
,
and
yet
no
Pharisee
;
he
be
in
earnest
,
and
yet
no
fanatic
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
the
Archdeacon
of
Barchester
be
a
man
do
more
good
than
harm
,
 
a
man
to
be
further
and
support
,
though
perhaps
also
to
be
control
;
and
it
be
matter
of
regret
to
us
that
the
course
of
our
narrative
have
require
that
we
should
see
more
of
his
weakness
than
his
strength
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
allow
himself
no
rest
till
everything
be
prepared
for
his
departure
from
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
to
mention
that
he
be
not
drive
to
the
stern
necessity
of
sell
all
his
furniture
:
he
have
be
quite
in
earnest
in
his
intention
to
do
so
,
but
it
be
soon
make
known
to
him
that
the
claim
of
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
make
no
such
step
obligatory
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
have
think
it
wise
to
make
use
of
the
threat
of
the
lawyer
's
bill
,
to
frighten
his
father
-
in
-
law
into
compliance
;
but
he
have
no
intention
to
saddle
Mr
Harding
with
cost
,
which
have
be
incur
by
no
mean
exclusively
for
his
benefit
.
<EOS>
the
amount
of
the
bill
be
add
to
the
diocesan
account
,
and
be
,
in
fact
,
pay
out
of
the
bishop
's
pocket
,
without
any
consciousness
on
the
part
of
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
a
great
part
of
his
furniture
he
do
resolve
to
sell
,
have
no
other
mean
to
dispose
of
it
;
and
the
pony
and
carriage
be
transfer
,
by
private
contract
,
to
the
use
of
an
old
maiden
lady
in
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
for
his
present
use
Mr
Harding
take
a
lodging
in
Barchester
,
and
thither
be
convey
such
article
as
he
want
for
daily
use
:
 
his
music
,
book
,
and
instrument
,
his
own
arm
-
chair
,
and
Eleanor
's
pet
sofa
;
her
teapoy
and
his
cellaret
,
and
also
the
slender
but
still
sufficient
content
of
his
wine
-
cellar
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
have
much
wish
that
her
sister
would
reside
at
Plumstead
,
till
her
father
's
house
at
Crabtree
should
be
ready
for
her
;
but
Eleanor
herself
strongly
resist
this
proposal
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
urge
upon
her
,
that
a
lady
in
lodging
cost
more
than
a
gentleman
;
and
that
,
under
her
father
's
present
circumstance
,
such
an
expense
should
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
have
not
press
her
father
to
give
up
the
hospital
in
order
that
she
may
live
at
Plumstead
Rectory
and
he
alone
in
his
Barchester
lodging
;
nor
do
Eleanor
think
that
she
would
be
treat
a
certain
gentleman
very
fairly
,
if
she
betook
herself
to
the
house
which
he
would
be
the
least
desirous
of
enter
of
any
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
so
she
get
a
little
bedroom
for
herself
behind
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
just
over
the
little
back
parlour
of
the
chemist
,
with
whom
they
be
to
lodge
.
<EOS>
there
be
somewhat
of
a
savour
of
senna
soften
by
peppermint
about
the
place
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
the
lodging
be
clean
and
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
have
be
fix
for
the
migration
of
the
ex
-
warden
,
and
all
Barchester
be
in
a
state
of
excitement
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
opinion
be
much
divide
as
to
the
propriety
of
Mr
Harding
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
the
mercantile
part
of
the
community
,
the
mayor
and
corporation
,
and
council
,
also
most
of
the
lady
,
be
loud
in
his
praise
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
noble
,
nothing
more
generous
,
nothing
more
upright
.
<EOS>
but
the
gentry
be
of
a
different
way
of
thinking
,
 
especially
the
lawyer
and
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
They
say
such
conduct
be
very
weak
and
undignified
;
that
Mr
Harding
evince
a
lamentable
want
of
_
esprit
de
corps
_
,
as
well
as
courage
;
and
that
such
an
abdication
must
do
much
harm
,
and
could
do
but
little
good
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
before
he
leave
,
he
summon
all
the
bedesman
into
his
parlour
to
wish
them
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
with
Bunce
he
have
be
in
frequent
communication
since
his
return
from
London
,
and
have
be
at
much
pain
to
explain
to
the
old
man
the
cause
of
his
resignation
,
without
in
any
way
prejudice
the
position
of
his
successor
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
also
,
he
have
see
more
or
less
frequently
;
and
have
hear
from
most
of
them
separately
some
expression
of
regret
at
his
departure
;
but
he
have
postpone
his
farewell
till
the
last
evening
.
  
<EOS>
He
now
bade
the
maid
put
wine
and
glass
on
the
table
;
and
have
the
chair
arrange
around
the
room
;
and
send
Bunce
to
each
of
the
man
to
request
they
would
come
and
say
farewell
to
their
late
warden
.
<EOS>
soon
the
noise
of
aged
scuffle
foot
be
hear
upon
the
gravel
and
in
the
little
hall
,
and
the
eleven
man
who
be
enable
to
leave
their
room
be
assemble
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
my
friend
,
come
in
,
"
say
the
warden
;
 
<EOS>
he
be
still
warden
then
.
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
and
sit
down
;
"
and
he
take
the
hand
of
Abel
Handy
,
who
be
the
near
to
him
,
and
lead
the
limping
grumbler
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
the
other
follow
slowly
and
bashfully
;
the
infirm
,
the
lame
,
and
the
blind
:
<EOS>
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
who
have
be
so
happy
,
have
they
but
know
it
!
<EOS>
now
their
aged
face
be
cover
with
shame
,
and
every
kind
word
from
their
master
be
a
coal
of
fire
burn
on
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
when
first
the
news
have
reach
them
that
Mr
Harding
be
go
to
leave
the
hospital
,
it
have
be
receive
with
a
kind
of
triumph
;
 
his
departure
be
,
as
it
be
,
a
prelude
to
success
.
<EOS>
He
have
admit
his
want
of
right
to
the
money
about
which
they
be
dispute
;
and
as
it
do
not
belong
to
him
,
of
course
,
it
do
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
one
hundred
a
year
to
each
of
them
be
actually
become
a
reality
;
and
Abel
Handy
be
a
hero
,
and
Bunce
a
faint
-
hearted
sycophant
,
worthy
neither
honour
nor
fellowship
.
<EOS>
but
other
tiding
soon
make
their
way
into
the
old
man
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
first
notify
to
them
that
the
income
abandon
by
Mr
Harding
would
not
come
to
them
;
and
these
account
be
confirm
by
attorney
Finney
.
<EOS>
They
be
then
inform
that
Mr
Harding
's
place
would
be
at
once
fill
by
another
.
<EOS>
that
the
new
warden
could
not
be
a
kind
man
they
all
know
;
that
he
would
be
a
less
friendly
one
most
suspect
;
and
then
come
the
bitter
information
that
,
from
the
moment
of
Mr
Harding
's
departure
,
the
twopence
a
day
,
his
own
peculiar
gift
,
must
of
necessity
be
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
to
be
the
end
of
all
their
mighty
struggle
,
 
of
their
fight
for
their
right
,
 
of
their
petition
,
and
their
debate
,
and
their
hope
!
<EOS>
They
be
to
change
the
good
of
master
for
a
possible
bad
one
,
and
to
lose
twopence
a
day
each
man
!
<EOS>
no
;
unfortunate
as
this
be
,
it
be
not
the
bad
,
or
nearly
the
bad
,
as
will
just
now
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
sit
down
,
my
friend
,
"
say
the
warden
;
"
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
you
and
to
drink
your
health
,
before
I
leave
you
.
<EOS>
come
up
here
,
Moody
,
here
be
a
chair
for
you
;
come
,
Jonathan
Crumple
;
"
 
and
by
degree
he
get
the
man
to
be
seat
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
surprising
that
they
should
hang
back
with
faint
heart
,
have
return
so
much
kindness
with
such
deep
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
last
of
all
of
them
come
Bunce
,
and
with
sorrowful
mien
and
slow
step
get
into
his
accustomed
seat
near
the
fire
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
all
in
their
place
,
Mr
Harding
rise
to
address
them
;
and
then
find
himself
not
quite
at
home
on
his
leg
,
he
sit
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
old
friend
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
you
all
know
that
I
be
go
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
murmur
run
round
the
room
,
intend
,
perhaps
,
to
express
regret
at
his
departure
;
but
it
be
but
a
murmur
,
and
may
have
mean
that
or
anything
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
lately
some
misunderstanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
You
have
think
,
I
believe
,
that
you
do
not
get
all
that
you
be
entitle
to
,
and
that
the
fund
of
the
hospital
have
not
be
properly
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
can
not
say
what
should
be
the
disposition
of
these
money
,
or
how
they
should
be
manage
,
and
I
have
therefore
think
it
best
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
want
to
drive
your
reverence
out
of
it
,
"
say
Handy
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
your
reverence
,
"
say
Skulpit
.
<EOS>
"
We
never
think
it
would
come
to
this
.
<EOS>
when
I
sign
the
petition
,
 
that
is
,
I
do
not
sign
it
,
because
 
"
  
"
let
his
reverence
speak
,
can
not
you
?
"
say
Moody
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
continue
Mr
Harding
;
"
I
be
sure
you
do
not
wish
to
turn
me
out
;
but
I
think
it
best
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
very
good
hand
at
a
lawsuit
,
as
you
may
all
guess
;
and
when
it
seem
necessary
that
our
ordinary
quiet
mode
of
living
should
be
disturb
,
I
think
it
better
to
go

<EOS>
I
be
neither
angry
nor
offend
with
any
man
in
the
hospital

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Bunce
utter
a
kind
of
groan
,
very
clearly
expressive
of
disagreement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
neither
angry
nor
displeased
with
any
man
in
the
hospital

repeat
Mr
Harding

emphatically

<EOS>
"
if
any
man
have
be
wrong

I
do
not

he
have
err

<EOS>
in

all
be

you

no

long
as
your

at
variance

I
could
give
you
no

the
connection
between

have
cease
;
my
income
can
no
longer
depend
on
your
doing

therefore

I
leave
you

I
venture
to
offer

you
my
advice

God

<EOS>
and
Mr

drink
his
wine
.
  
<EOS>
another
murmur
,
somewhat
more
articulate
than
the
first
,
pass
round
the
circle
,
and
this
time
it
be
intend
to
imply
a
blessing
on
Mr

<EOS>
It
have
,
however
,
but
little
cordiality
in
it

<EOS>
poor
old
man
!
<EOS>
how
could
they
be
cordial
with
their
sore
conscience
and
shame
face
?
<EOS>
how
could
they
bid
God
bless
him
with
hearty
voice
and
a
true
benison
,
know
,
as
they
do
,
that
their
vile
cabal
have
drive
him
from

home

send
him
in
his
old
age
to
seek
shelter
under
a
strange
roof
-
tree
?
<EOS>
They
do
their
good
,
however
;
they
drank
their
wine
,
and
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
leave
the
hall

door
,
Mr

shake
hand
with
each
of
the
man
,
and
speak
a
kind
word
to
them
about
their
individual
case
and
ailment
;
and
so
they
depart
,
answer
his
question
in
the
few
word
,
and
retreat
to
their
den
,
a
sorrowful
repentant
crew

<EOS>
all
but
Bunce

who
still
remain
to
make

own
farewell

<EOS>
"
there
be
poor
old
Bell
,
"

Mr

I
must
not
go
without
say
a
word
to
him
;
come
through
with
me
,
Bunce
,
and
bring
the
wine
with
you
;
"
and
so
they
go
through
to
the
man
's
cottage
,
and
find
the
old
man
prop
up
as
usual
in
his
bed

<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
say
good

bye

you

Bell

"
say
Mr

speak
loud
,
for
the
old

be
deaf

"
and
be
you
go
away
,
then
,
really
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
be
,
and
I
have
bring
you
a
glass
of
wine

so
that
we
may
part
friend

as
we

you
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
take
the
proffer
glass
in
his
shake
hand
,
and
drank
it
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
bless
you

"
good

my

<EOS>
"
and
so
you
be
really
go
?
<EOS>
"
the
man
again
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
be
,
Bell
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
poor
old
bed
-
ride
creature
still
keep
Mr
Harding
's
hand
in
his
own
,
and
the
warden
think
that
he
have
meet
with
something
like
warmth
of
feeling
in
the
one
of
all
his
subject
from
whom
it
be
the
least
likely
to
be
expect
;
for
poor
old
Bell
have
nearly
outlive
all
human
feeling
.
"
<EOS>
and
your
reverence
,
"
say
he
,
and
then
he
pause
,
while
his
old
palsied
head
shake
horribly
,
and
his
shrivel
cheek
sink
low
within
his
jaw
,
and
his
glazy
eye
gleam
with
a
momentary
light
;
"
and
your
reverence
<EOS>
,
shall
we
get
the
hundred
a
year
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
gently
do
Mr
Harding
try
to
extinguish
the
false
hope
of
money
which
have
be
so
wretchedly
raise
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
die
man
!
<EOS>
one
other
week
and
his
mortal
coil
would
be
shuffle
off
;
in
one
short
week
would
God
resume
his
soul
,
and
set
it
apart
for
its
irrevocable
doom
;
seven
more
tedious
day
and
night
of
senseless
inactivity
,
and
all
would
be
over
for
poor
Bell
in
this
world
;
and
yet
,
with
his
last
audible
word
,
he
be
demand
his
moneyed
right
,
and
assert
himself
to
be
the
proper
heir
of
John
Hiram
's
bounty
!
<EOS>
not
on
him
,
poor
sinner
as
he
be
,
be
the
load
of
such
sin
!
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
return
to
his
parlour
,
meditate
with
a
sick
heart
on
what
he
have
see
,
and
Bunce
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
describe
the
parting
of
these
two
good
man
,
for
good
man
they
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
the
late
warden
endeavour
to
comfort
the
heart
of
the
old
bedesman
;
poor
old
Bunce
feel
that
his
day
of
comfort
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
hospital
have
to
him
be
a
happy
home
,
but
it
could
be
so
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
honour
there
,
and
friendship
;
he
have
recognise
his
master
,
and
be
recognise
;
all
his
want
,
both
of
soul
and
body
,
have
be
supply
,
and
he
have
be
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
He
weep
grievously
as
he
part
from
his
friend
,
and
the
tear
of
an
old
man
be
bitter
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
over
for
me
in
this
world
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
give
the
last
squeeze
to
Mr
Harding
's
hand
;
"
I
have
now
to
forgive
those
who
have
injure
me
;
 
and
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
old
man
go
out
,
and
then
Mr
Harding
give
way
to
his
grief
and
he
too
weep
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
conclusion
 
<EOS>
Our
tale
be
now
do
,
and
it
only
remain
to
us
to
collect
the
scatter
thread
of
our
little
story
,
and
to
tie
them
into
a
seemly
knot
.
<EOS>
this
will
not
be
a
work
of
labour
,
either
to
the
author
or
to
his
reader
;
we
have
not
to
deal
with
many
personage
,
or
with
stirring
event
,
and
be
it
not
for
the
custom
of
the
thing
,
we
may
leave
it
to
the
imagination
of
all
concern
to
conceive
how
affair
at
Barchester
arrange
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
after
the
day
last
allude
to
,
Mr
Harding
,
at
an
early
hour
,
walk
out
of
the
hospital
,
with
his
daughter
under
his
arm
,
and
sit
down
quietly
to
breakfast
at
his
lodging
over
the
chemist
's
shop
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
parade
about
his
departure
;
no
one
,
not
even
Bunce
,
be
there
to
witness
it
;
have
he
walk
to
the
apothecary
's
thus
early
to
get
a
piece
of
court
plaster
,
or
a
box
of
lozenge
,
he
could
not
have
do
it
with
less
appearance
of
an
important
movement
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
tear
in
Eleanor
's
eye
as
she
pass
through
the
big
gateway
and
over
the
bridge
;
but
Mr
Harding
walk
with
an
elastic
step
,
and
enter
his
new
abode
with
a
pleasant
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
have
everything
ready
,
and
you
can
make
tea
here
just
as
nicely
as
in
the
parlour
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
Eleanor
take
off
her
bonnet
and
make
the
tea
.
<EOS>
after
this
manner
do
the
late
Warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
accomplish
his
flitting
,
and
change
his
residence
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
the
archdeacon
bring
his
father
to
discuss
the
subject
of
a
new
warden
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
look
upon
the
nomination
as
his
own
,
and
he
have
in
his
eye
three
or
four
fitting
candidate
,
see
that
Mr
Cummins
's
plan
as
to
the
living
of
Puddingdale
could
not
be
bring
to
bear
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
describe
the
astonishment
which
confound
him
,
when
his
father
declare
that
he
would
appoint
no
successor
to
Mr
Harding
?
<EOS>
"
if
we
can
get
the
matter
set
to
right
,
Mr
Harding
will
return
,
"
say
the
bishop
;
"
and
if
we
can
not
,
it
will
be
wrong
to
put
any
other
gentleman
into
so
cruel
a
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
the
archdeacon
argue
and
lecture
,
and
even
threaten
;
in
vain
he
my
-
lord
his
poor
father
in
his
stern
manner
;
in
vain
his
"
good
heaven
!
"
be
ejaculate
in
a
tone
that
may
have
move
a
whole
synod
,
let
alone
one
weak
and
aged
bishop
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
induce
his
father
to
fill
up
the
vacancy
cause
by
Mr
Harding
's
retirement
.
  
<EOS>
even
John
Bold
would
have
pity
the
feeling
with
which
the
archdeacon
return
to
plumstead
:
the
church
be
fall
,
nay
,
already
in
ruin
;
its
dignitary
be
yield
without
a
struggle
before
the
blow
of
its
antagonist
;
and
one
of
its
most
respected
bishop
,
his
own
father
,
 
the
man
consider
by
all
the
world
as
be
in
such
matter
under
his
,
Dr
Grantly
's
,
control
,
 
have
positively
resolve
to
capitulate
,
and
own
himself
vanquish
!
  
<EOS>
and
how
fare
the
hospital
under
this
resolve
of
its
visitor
?
<EOS>
badly
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
some
year
since
Mr
Harding
leave
it
,
and
the
warden
's
house
be
still
tenantless
.
<EOS>
Old
Bell
have
die
,
and
Billy
Gazy
;
the
one
-
eyed
Spriggs
have
drink
himself
to
death
,
and
three
other
of
the
twelve
have
be
gather
into
the
churchyard
mould
.
<EOS>
six
have
go
,
and
the
six
vacancy
remain
unfilled
!
<EOS>
yes
,
six
have
die
,
with
no
kind
friend
to
solace
their
last
moment
,
with
no
wealthy
neighbour
to
administer
comfort
and
ease
the
sting
of
death
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
indeed
,
do
not
desert
them
;
from
him
they
have
such
consolation
as
a
die
man
may
receive
from
his
christian
pastor
;
but
it
be
the
occasional
kindness
of
a
stranger
which
minister
to
them
,
and
not
the
constant
presence
of
a
master
,
a
neighbour
,
and
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
those
who
remain
well
off
than
those
who
die
.
<EOS>
dissension
rise
among
them
,
and
contest
for
pre
-
eminence
;
and
then
they
begin
to
understand
that
soon
one
among
them
would
be
the
last
,
 
<EOS>
some
one
wretched
being
would
be
alone
there
in
that
now
comfortless
hospital
,
 
the
miserable
relic
of
what
have
once
be
so
good
and
so
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
the
building
of
the
hospital
itself
have
not
be
allow
to
go
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
,
who
still
hold
his
stewardship
,
and
pay
the
accrue
rent
into
an
account
open
at
a
bank
for
the
purpose
,
see
to
that
;
but
the
whole
place
have
become
disorder
and
ugly
.
<EOS>
the
warden
's
garden
be
a
wretched
wilderness
,
the
drive
and
path
be
cover
with
weed
,
the
flower
-
bed
be
bare
,
and
the
unshorn
lawn
be
now
a
mass
of
long
damp
grass
and
unwholesome
mos
.
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
the
place
be
go
;
its
attraction
have
wither
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
a
very
few
year
since
it
be
the
prettiest
spot
in
Barchester
,
and
now
it
be
a
disgrace
to
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
do
not
go
out
to
Crabtree
Parva
.
<EOS>
an
arrangement
be
make
which
respect
the
homestead
of
Mr
Smith
and
his
happy
family
,
and
put
Mr
Harding
into
possession
of
a
small
living
within
the
wall
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
small
possible
parish
,
contain
a
part
of
the
Cathedral
Close
and
a
few
old
house
adjoin
.
<EOS>
the
church
be
a
singular
little
gothic
building
,
perch
over
a
gateway
,
through
which
the
Close
be
enter
,
and
be
approach
by
a
flight
of
stone
step
which
lead
down
under
the
archway
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
big
than
an
ordinary
room
,
 
perhaps
twenty
-
seven
foot
long
by
eighteen
wide
,
 
but
still
it
be
a
perfect
church
.
<EOS>
It
contain
an
old
carved
pulpit
and
reading
-
desk
,
a
tiny
altar
under
a
window
fill
with
dark
old
-
coloured
glass
,
a
font
,
some
half
-
dozen
pew
,
and
perhaps
a
dozen
seat
for
the
poor
;
and
also
a
vestry
.
<EOS>
the
roof
be
high
pitch
,
and
of
black
old
oak
,
and
the
three
large
beam
which
support
it
run
down
to
the
side
wall
,
and
terminate
in
grotesquely
carve
face
,
 
two
devil
and
an
angel
on
one
side
,
two
angel
and
a
devil
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
church
of
St
Cuthbert
at
Barchester
,
of
which
Mr
Harding
become
rector
,
with
a
clear
income
of
seventy
-
five
pound
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
here
he
perform
afternoon
service
every
Sunday
,
and
administer
the
Sacrament
once
in
every
three
month
.
<EOS>
His
audience
be
not
large
;
and
,
have
they
be
so
,
he
could
not
have
accommodate
them
:
but
enough
come
to
fill
his
six
pew
,
and
on
the
front
seat
of
those
devote
to
the
poor
be
always
to
be
see
our
old
friend
Mr
Bunce
,
decently
array
in
his
bedesman
's
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
be
still
precentor
of
Barchester
;
and
it
be
very
rarely
the
case
that
those
who
attend
the
Sunday
morning
service
miss
the
gratification
of
hear
him
chant
the
Litany
,
as
no
other
man
in
England
can
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
neither
a
discontent
nor
an
unhappy
man
;
he
still
inhabit
the
lodging
to
which
he
go
on
leave
the
hospital
,
but
he
now
have
them
to
himself
.
<EOS>
three
month
after
that
time
Eleanor
become
Mrs
Bold
,
and
of
course
remove
to
her
husband
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
difficulty
to
be
get
over
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
,
who
could
not
so
soon
overcome
his
grief
,
would
not
be
persuade
to
grace
the
ceremony
with
his
presence
,
but
he
allow
his
wife
and
child
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
take
place
in
the
cathedral
,
and
the
bishop
himself
officiate
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
occasion
on
which
he
ever
do
so
;
and
,
though
he
still
live
,
it
be
not
probable
that
he
will
ever
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
not
long
after
the
marriage
,
perhaps
six
month
,
when
Eleanor
's
bridal
-
honour
be
fade
,
and
person
be
begin
to
call
her
Mrs
Bold
without
twitter
,
the
archdeacon
consent
to
meet
John
Bold
at
a
dinner
-
party
,
and
since
that
time
they
have
become
almost
friend
.
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
firmly
believe
that
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
,
as
a
bachelor
,
an
infidel
,
an
unbeliever
in
the
great
truth
of
our
religion
;
but
that
matrimony
have
open
his
eye
,
as
it
have
those
of
other
.
<EOS>
and
Bold
be
equally
inclined
to
think
that
time
have
soften
the
asperity
of
the
archdeacon
's
character
.
<EOS>
friend
though
they
be
,
they
do
not
often
revert
to
the
feud
of
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
we
say
,
be
not
an
unhappy
man
:
he
keep
his
lodging
,
but
they
be
of
little
use
to
him
,
except
as
be
the
one
spot
on
earth
which
he
call
his
own
.
<EOS>
His
time
be
spend
chiefly
at
his
daughter
's
or
at
the
palace
;
he
be
never
leave
alone
,
even
should
he
wish
to
be
so
;
and
within
a
twelvemonth
of
Eleanor
's
marriage
his
determination
to
live
at
his
own
lodging
have
be
so
far
break
through
and
abandon
,
that
he
consent
to
have
his
violoncello
permanently
remove
to
his
daughter
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
every
other
day
a
message
be
bring
to
him
from
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
the
bishop
's
compliment
,
and
his
lordship
be
not
very
well
to
-
day
,
and
he
hope
Mr
Harding
will
dine
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
this
bulletin
as
to
the
old
man
's
health
be
a
myth
;
for
though
he
be
over
eighty
<EOS>
he
be
never
ill
,
and
will
probably
die
some
day
,
as
a
spark
go
out
,
gradually
and
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
do
dine
with
him
very
often
,
which
mean
go
to
the
palace
at
three
and
remain
till
ten
;
and
whenever
he
do
not
the
bishop
whine
,
and
say
that
the
port
wine
be
cork
,
and
complain
that
nobody
attend
to
him
,
and
fret
himself
off
to
bed
an
hour
before
his
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
the
people
of
Barchester
forget
to
call
Mr
Harding
by
his
long
well
-
know
name
of
Warden
.
<EOS>
It
have
become
so
customary
to
say
Mr
Warden
,
that
it
be
not
easily
drop
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
"
he
always
say
when
so
addressed
,
"
not
warden
now
,
only
precentor
.
