the
BATTLE
of
dorking
:
reminiscences
of
a
<EOS>
VOLUNTEERbyGeorge
ChesneyYou
ask
me
to
tell
you
,
my
grandchild
,
something
about
my
own
share
in
the
great
event
that
happen
fifty
year
ago
.
'
<EOS>
tis
sad
work
turn
back
to
that
bitter
page
in
our
history
,
but
you
may
perhaps
take
profit
in
your
new
home
from
the
lesson
it
teach
.
<EOS>
for
us
in
England
it
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
and
yet
we
have
plenty
of
warning
,
if
we
have
only
make
use
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
danger
do
not
come
on
us
unaware
.
<EOS>
It
burst
on
us
suddenly
,
'
tis
true
;
but
its
coming
be
foreshadow
plainly
enough
to
open
our
eye
,
if
we
have
not
be
wilfully
blind
.
<EOS>
We
English
have
only
ourselves
to
blame
for
the
humiliation
which
have
be
bring
on
the
land
.
<EOS>
venerable
old
age
!
<EOS>
dishonourable
old
age
,
I
say
,
when
it
follow
a
manhood
dishonour
as
our
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
even
now
,
though
fifty
year
have
pass
,
I
can
hardly
look
a
young
man
in
the
face
when
I
think
I
be
one
of
those
in
whose
youth
happen
this
degradation
of
Old
England
---
one
of
those
who
betray
the
trust
hand
down
to
us
unstaine
by
our
forefather
.
<EOS>
what
a
proud
and
happy
country
be
this
fifty
year
ago
!
<EOS>
free
-
trade
have
be
work
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
and
there
seem
to
be
no
end
to
the
riches
it
be
bring
us
.
<EOS>
London
be
grow
big
and
big
;
you
could
not
build
house
fast
enough
for
the
rich
people
who
want
to
live
in
them
,
the
merchant
who
make
the
money
and
come
from
all
part
of
the
world
to
settle
there
,
and
the
lawyer
and
doctor
and
engineer
and
other
,
and
trade
-
people
who
get
their
share
out
of
the
profit
.
<EOS>
the
street
reach
down
to
Croydon
and
Wimbledon
,
which
my
father
could
remember
quite
country
place
;
and
people
use
to
say
that
Kingston
and
Reigate
would
soon
be
join
to
London
.
<EOS>
We
think
we
could
go
on
building
and
multiply
for
ever
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
that
even
then
there
be
no
lack
of
poverty
;
the
people
who
have
no
money
go
on
increase
as
fast
as
the
rich
,
and
pauperism
be
already
begin
to
be
a
difficulty
;
but
if
the
rate
be
high
,
there
be
plenty
of
money
to
pay
them
with
;
and
as
for
what
be
call
the
middle
class
,
there
really
seem
no
limit
to
their
increase
and
prosperity
.
<EOS>
People
in
those
day
think
it
quite
a
matter
of
course
to
bring
a
dozen
of
child
into
the
world
--
or
,
as
it
use
to
be
say
,
Providence
send
them
that
number
of
baby
;
and
if
they
could
not
always
marry
off
all
the
daughter
,
they
use
to
manage
to
provide
for
the
son
,
for
there
be
new
opening
to
be
find
in
all
the
profession
,
or
in
the
Government
office
,
which
go
on
steadily
get
large
.
<EOS>
besides
,
in
those
day
young
man
could
be
send
out
to
India
,
or
into
the
army
or
navy
;
and
even
then
emigration
be
not
uncommon
,
although
not
the
regular
custom
it
be
now
.
<EOS>
schoolmaster
,
like
all
other
professional
class
,
drive
a
capital
trade
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
teach
very
much
,
to
be
sure
,
but
new
school
with
their
four
or
five
hundred
boy
be
spring
up
all
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
fool
that
we
be
!
<EOS>
We
think
that
all
this
wealth
and
prosperity
be
send
us
by
Providence
,
and
could
not
stop
come
.
<EOS>
in
our
blindness
we
do
not
see
that
we
be
merely
a
big
workshop
,
make
up
the
thing
which
come
from
all
part
of
the
world
;
and
that
if
other
nation
stop
send
us
raw
good
to
work
up
,
we
could
not
produce
them
ourselves
.
<EOS>
true
,
we
have
in
those
day
an
advantage
in
our
cheap
coal
and
iron
;
and
have
we
take
care
not
to
waste
the
fuel
,
it
may
have
last
us
longer
.
<EOS>
but
even
then
there
be
sign
that
coal
and
iron
would
soon
become
cheap
in
foreign
part
;
while
as
to
food
and
other
thing
,
England
be
not
well
off
than
it
be
now
.
<EOS>
We
be
so
rich
simply
because
other
nation
from
all
part
of
the
world
be
in
the
habit
of
send
their
good
to
us
to
be
sell
or
manufacture
;
and
we
think
that
this
would
last
for
ever
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
perhaps
,
it
may
have
last
,
if
we
have
only
take
proper
mean
to
keep
it
;
but
,
in
our
folly
,
we
be
too
careless
even
to
insure
our
prosperity
,
and
after
the
course
of
trade
be
turn
away
<EOS>
it
would
not
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
ever
a
nation
have
a
plain
warning
,
we
have
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
the
great
trading
country
,
our
neighbour
be
the
lead
military
power
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
They
be
drive
a
good
trade
,
too
,
for
this
be
before
their
foolish
communism
(
about
which
you
will
hear
when
you
be
old
)
have
ruin
the
rich
without
benefit
the
poor
,
and
they
be
in
many
respect
the
first
nation
in
Europe
;
but
it
be
on
their
army
that
they
pride
themselves
most
.
<EOS>
and
with
reason
.
<EOS>
They
have
beat
the
Russians
and
the
Austrians
,
and
the
Prussians
too
,
in
bygone
year
,
and
they
think
they
be
invincible
.
<EOS>
well
do
I
remember
the
great
review
hold
at
Paris
by
the
Emperor
Napoleon
during
the
great
exhibition
,
and
how
proud
he
look
show
off
his
splendid
Guards
to
the
assemble
king
and
prince
.
<EOS>
yet
,
three
year
afterwards
,
the
force
so
long
deem
the
first
in
Europe
be
ignominiously
beat
,
and
the
whole
army
take
prisoner
.
<EOS>
such
a
defeat
have
never
happen
before
in
the
world
's
history
;
and
with
this
proof
before
us
of
the
folly
of
disbelieve
in
the
possibility
of
disaster
merely
because
it
have
never
fall
upon
us
,
it
may
have
be
suppose
that
we
should
have
the
sense
to
take
the
lesson
to
heart
.
<EOS>
and
the
country
be
certainly
rouse
for
a
time
,
and
a
cry
be
raise
that
the
army
ought
to
be
reorganise
,
and
our
defence
strengthen
against
the
enormous
power
for
sudden
attack
which
it
be
see
other
nation
be
able
to
put
forth
.
<EOS>
and
a
scheme
of
army
reform
be
bring
forward
by
the
Government
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
half
-
and
-
half
affair
at
best
;
and
,
unfortunately
,
instead
of
be
take
up
in
Parliament
as
a
national
scheme
,
it
be
make
a
party
matter
of
,
and
so
fall
through
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
radical
section
of
the
House
,
too
,
whose
vote
have
to
be
secure
by
conciliation
,
and
which
blindly
demand
a
reduction
of
armament
as
the
price
of
allegiance
.
<EOS>
this
party
always
decry
military
establishment
as
part
of
a
fix
policy
for
reduce
the
influence
of
the
Crown
and
the
aristocracy
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
understand
that
the
time
have
altogether
change
,
that
the
Crown
have
really
no
power
,
and
that
the
Government
merely
exist
at
the
pleasure
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
that
even
Parliament
-
rule
be
begin
to
give
way
to
mob
-
law
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
the
Ministry
,
baffle
on
all
side
,
give
up
by
degree
all
the
strong
point
of
a
scheme
which
they
be
not
heartily
in
earnest
about
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
there
be
any
lack
of
money
,
if
only
it
have
be
spend
in
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
the
army
cost
enough
,
and
more
than
enough
,
to
give
us
a
proper
defence
,
and
there
be
armed
man
of
sort
in
plenty
and
to
spare
,
if
only
they
have
be
decently
organise
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
organisation
and
forethought
that
we
fall
short
,
because
our
ruler
do
not
heartily
believe
in
the
need
for
preparation
.
<EOS>
the
fleet
and
the
Channel
,
they
say
,
be
sufficient
protection
.
<EOS>
so
army
reform
be
put
off
to
some
more
convenient
season
,
and
the
militia
and
volunteer
be
leave
untrained
as
before
,
because
to
call
them
out
for
drill
would
"
interfere
with
the
industry
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
We
could
have
give
up
some
of
the
industry
of
those
day
,
forsooth
,
and
yet
be
busy
than
we
be
now
.
<EOS>
but
why
tell
you
a
tale
you
have
so
often
hear
already
?
<EOS>
the
nation
,
although
uneasy
,
be
mislead
by
the
false
security
its
leader
profess
to
feel
;
the
warning
give
by
the
disaster
that
overtook
France
be
allow
to
pass
by
unheeded
.
<EOS>
We
would
not
even
be
at
the
trouble
of
put
our
arsenal
in
a
safe
place
,
or
of
guard
the
capital
against
a
surprise
,
although
the
cost
of
do
so
would
not
have
be
so
much
as
miss
from
the
national
wealth
.
<EOS>
the
French
trust
in
their
army
and
its
great
reputation
,
we
in
our
fleet
;
and
in
each
case
the
result
of
this
blind
confidence
be
disaster
,
such
as
our
forefather
in
their
hard
struggle
could
not
have
even
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
tell
you
how
the
crash
come
about
.
<EOS>
first
,
the
rise
in
India
draw
away
a
part
of
our
small
army
;
then
come
the
difficulty
with
America
,
which
have
be
threaten
for
year
,
and
we
send
off
ten
thousand
man
to
defend
Canada
--
a
handful
which
do
not
go
far
to
strengthen
the
real
defence
of
that
country
,
but
form
an
irresistible
temptation
to
the
Americans
to
try
and
take
them
prisoner
,
especially
as
the
contingent
include
three
battalion
of
the
Guards
.
<EOS>
thus
the
regular
army
at
home
be
even
small
than
usual
,
and
nearly
half
of
it
be
in
Ireland
to
check
the
talk
-
of
fenian
invasion
fit
out
in
the
West
.
<EOS>
bad
still
--
though
I
do
not
know
it
would
really
have
matter
as
thing
turn
out
<EOS>
---
the
fleet
be
scatter
abroad
:
some
ship
to
guard
the
West
Indies
,
other
to
check
privateere
in
the
China
sea
,
and
a
large
part
to
try
and
protect
our
colony
on
the
Northern
Pacific
shore
of
America
,
where
,
with
incredible
folly
,
we
continue
to
retain
possession
which
we
could
not
possibly
defend
.
<EOS>
America
be
not
the
great
power
forty
year
ago
that
it
be
now
;
but
for
us
to
try
and
hold
territory
on
her
shore
which
could
only
be
reach
by
sailing
round
the
Horn
,
be
as
absurd
as
if
she
have
attempt
to
take
the
Isle
of
Man
before
the
indepedence
of
Ireland
.
<EOS>
We
see
this
plainly
enough
now
,
but
we
be
all
blind
then
.
<EOS>
It
be
while
we
be
in
this
state
,
with
our
ship
all
over
the
world
,
and
our
little
bit
of
an
army
cut
up
into
detachment
,
that
the
Secret
Treaty
be
publish
,
and
Holland
and
Denmark
be
annex
.
<EOS>
People
say
now
that
we
may
have
escape
the
trouble
which
come
on
us
if
we
have
at
any
rate
keep
quiet
till
our
other
difficulty
be
settle
;
but
the
English
be
always
an
impulsive
lot
:
the
whole
country
be
boil
over
with
indignation
,
and
the
Government
,
egg
on
by
the
press
,
and
go
with
the
stream
,
declare
war
.
<EOS>
We
have
always
get
out
of
scrape
before
,
and
we
believe
our
old
luck
and
pluck
would
somehow
pull
us
through
.
<EOS>
then
,
of
course
,
there
be
bustle
and
hurry
all
over
the
land
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
calling
up
of
the
army
reserve
cause
much
stir
,
for
I
think
there
be
only
about
5000
altogether
,
and
a
good
many
of
these
be
not
to
be
find
when
the
time
come
;
but
recruiting
be
go
on
all
over
the
country
,
with
a
tremendous
high
bounty
,
50,000
more
man
have
be
vote
for
the
army
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
Ballot
Bill
pass
for
add
55,500
man
to
the
militia
;
why
a
round
number
be
not
fix
on
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
the
Prime
Minister
say
that
this
be
the
exact
quota
want
to
put
the
defence
of
the
country
on
a
sound
foot
.
<EOS>
then
the
shipbuilding
that
begin
!
<EOS>
ironclad
,
despatch
-
boat
,
gunboat
,
monitors,---every
building
-
yard
in
the
country
get
its
job
,
and
they
be
offer
ten
shilling
a
-
day
wage
for
anybody
who
could
drive
a
rivet
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
improve
the
recruiting
,
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
too
,
there
be
a
squabble
in
the
House
of
Commons
about
whether
artisan
should
be
draw
for
the
ballot
,
as
they
be
so
much
want
,
and
I
think
they
get
an
exemption
.
<EOS>
this
send
number
to
the
yard
;
and
if
we
have
have
a
couple
of
year
to
prepare
instead
of
a
couple
of
week
,
I
daresay
we
should
have
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
a
Monday
that
the
declaration
of
war
be
announce
,
and
in
a
few
hour
we
get
our
first
inkling
of
the
sort
of
preparation
the
enemy
have
make
for
the
event
which
they
have
really
bring
about
,
although
the
actual
declaration
be
make
by
us
.
<EOS>
a
pious
appeal
to
the
God
of
battle
,
whom
it
be
say
we
have
arouse
,
be
telegraph
back
;
and
from
that
momnet
all
communication
with
the
north
of
Europe
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
Our
embassy
and
legation
be
pack
off
at
an
hour
's
notice
,
and
it
be
as
if
we
have
suddenly
come
back
to
the
middle
age
.
<EOS>
the
dumb
astonishment
visible
all
over
London
the
next
morning
,
when
the
paper
come
out
void
of
news
,
merely
hint
at
what
have
happen
<EOS>
,
be
one
of
the
most
startling
thing
in
this
war
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
but
everything
have
be
arrange
beforehand
;
nor
ought
we
to
have
be
surprise
,
for
we
have
see
the
same
Power
,
only
a
few
month
before
,
move
down
half
a
million
of
man
on
a
few
day
'
notice
,
to
conquer
the
great
military
nation
in
Europe
,
with
no
more
fuss
than
our
War
Office
use
to
make
over
the
transport
of
a
brigade
from
Aldershot
to
Brighton,--and
this
,
too
,
without
the
ally
it
have
now
.
<EOS>
what
happen
now
be
not
a
bit
more
wonderful
in
reality
;
but
people
of
this
country
could
not
bring
themselves
to
believe
that
what
have
never
occur
before
to
England
could
ever
possibly
happen
.
<EOS>
like
our
neighbour
,
we
become
wise
when
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
paper
be
not
long
in
get
news
---
<EOS>
even
the
mighty
organisation
set
at
work
could
not
shut
out
a
special
correspondent
;
and
in
a
very
few
day
,
although
the
telegraph
and
railway
be
intercept
right
across
Europe
,
the
main
fact
ooze
out
.
<EOS>
an
embargo
have
be
lay
on
all
the
shipping
in
every
port
from
the
Baltic
to
ostend
;
the
fleet
of
the
two
great
Powers
have
move
out
,
and
it
be
suppose
be
assemble
in
the
great
northern
harbour
,
and
troop
be
hurry
on
board
all
the
steamer
detain
in
these
place
,
most
of
which
be
british
vessel
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
invasion
be
intend
.
<EOS>
even
then
we
may
have
be
save
,
if
the
fleet
have
be
ready
.
<EOS>
the
fort
which
guard
the
flotilla
be
perhaps
too
strong
for
shipping
to
attempt
;
but
an
ironclad
or
two
,
handle
as
british
sailor
know
how
to
use
them
,
may
have
destroy
or
damage
a
part
of
the
transport
,
and
delay
the
expedition
,
give
us
what
we
want
,
time
.
<EOS>
but
then
the
good
part
of
the
fleet
have
be
decoy
down
to
the
Dardanelles
,
and
what
remain
of
the
Channel
squadron
be
look
after
fenian
filibuster
off
the
west
of
Ireland
;
so
it
be
ten
day
before
the
fleet
be
get
together
,
and
by
that
time
it
be
plain
the
enemy
's
preparation
be
too
far
advanced
to
be
stop
by
a
coup
-
de-
main
.
<EOS>
information
,
which
come
chiefly
through
Italy
,
come
slowly
,
and
be
more
or
less
vague
and
uncertain
;
but
this
much
be
know
,
that
at
least
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
man
be
embark
or
ready
to
be
put
on
board
ship
,
and
that
the
flotilla
be
guard
by
more
ironclad
than
we
could
then
muster
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
point
the
enemy
would
aim
at
for
landing
,
and
the
fear
lest
he
should
give
us
the
go
-
by
,
that
keep
the
fleet
for
several
day
in
the
down
;
but
it
be
not
until
the
Tuesday
fortnight
after
the
declaration
of
war
that
it
weigh
anchor
and
steam
away
for
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
have
read
about
the
Queen
's
visit
to
the
fleet
the
day
before
,
and
how
she
sail
round
the
ship
in
her
yacht
,
and
go
on
board
the
flag
-
ship
to
take
leave
of
the
admiral
;
how
,
overcome
with
emotion
,
she
tell
him
that
the
safety
of
the
country
be
commit
to
his
keeping
.
<EOS>
You
remember
,
too
,
the
gallant
old
officer
's
reply
,
and
how
all
the
ship
'
yard
be
man
,
and
how
lustily
the
tar
cheer
as
her
Majesty
be
row
off
.
<EOS>
the
account
be
of
course
telegraph
to
London
,
and
the
high
spirit
of
the
fleet
infect
the
whole
town
.
<EOS>
I
be
outside
the
Charing
Cross
station
when
the
Queen
's
special
train
from
Dover
arrive
,
and
from
the
cheering
and
shouting
which
greet
her
Majesty
as
she
drive
away
,
you
may
have
suppose
we
have
already
win
a
great
victory
.
<EOS>
the
lead
journal
,
which
have
go
in
strongly
for
the
army
reduction
carry
out
during
the
session
,
and
have
be
nervous
and
despond
in
tone
during
the
past
fortnight
,
suggest
all
sort
of
compromise
as
a
way
of
get
out
of
the
war
,
come
out
in
a
very
jubilant
form
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Panic-
stricken
inquirers,"it
say
,
"
ask
now
,
where
be
the
mean
of
meet
the
invasion
?
<EOS>
We
reply
that
the
invasion
will
never
take
place
.
<EOS>
a
british
fleet
,
man
by
british
sailor
whose
courage
and
enthusiasm
be
reflect
in
the
people
of
this
country
,
be
already
on
the
way
to
meet
the
presumptuous
foe
.
<EOS>
the
issue
of
a
contest
between
british
ship
and
those
of
any
other
country
,
under
anything
like
equal
odd
,
can
never
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>
England
await
with
calm
confidence
the
issue
of
the
impending
action
.
<EOS>
"Such
be
the
word
of
the
lead
article
,
and
so
we
all
feel
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
Tuesday
,
the
10th
of
August
,
that
the
fleet
sail
from
the
Downs
.
<EOS>
It
take
with
it
a
submarine
cable
to
lay
down
as
it
advance
,
so
that
continuous
communication
be
keep
up
,
and
the
paper
be
publish
special
edition
every
few
minute
with
the
late
news
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
such
a
thing
have
be
do
,
and
the
feat
be
accept
as
a
good
oman
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
true
that
the
Admiralty
make
use
of
the
cable
to
keep
on
send
contradictory
order
,
which
take
the
command
out
of
the
admiral
's
hand
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
all
that
the
admiral
send
in
return
be
a
few
message
of
the
brief
kind
,
which
neither
the
Admiralty
nor
any
one
else
could
have
make
any
use
of
.
<EOS>
such
a
ship
have
go
off
reconnoitre
;
such
another
have
rejoin
--
fleet
be
in
latitude
so
<EOS>
and
so
.
<EOS>
this
go
on
till
the
Thursday
morning
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
come
up
to
town
by
train
as
usual
,
and
be
walk
to
my
office
,
when
the
newsboy
begin
to
cry
,
"
new
edition
--
enemy
's
fleet
in
sight
!
<EOS>
"
You
may
imagine
the
scene
in
London
!
<EOS>
business
still
go
on
at
the
bank
,
for
bill
mature
although
the
independence
of
the
country
be
be
fight
out
under
our
own
eye
,
so
to
say
,
and
the
speculator
be
active
enough
.
<EOS>
but
even
with
the
people
who
be
make
and
lose
their
fortune
,
the
interest
in
the
fleet
overcome
everything
else
;
man
who
go
to
pay
in
or
draw
out
their
money
stop
to
show
the
last
bulletin
to
the
cashier
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
street
,
you
could
hardly
get
along
for
the
crowd
stop
to
buy
and
read
the
paper
;
while
at
every
house
or
office
the
member
sit
restlessly
in
the
common
room
,
as
if
to
keep
together
for
company
,
send
out
some
one
of
their
number
every
few
minute
to
get
the
late
edition
.
<EOS>
at
least
this
be
what
happen
at
our
office
;
but
to
sit
still
be
as
impossible
as
to
do
anything
,
and
most
of
us
go
out
and
wander
about
among
the
crowd
,
under
a
sort
of
feeling
that
the
news
be
get
quick
at
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
bad
as
be
the
time
come
,
I
think
the
sickening
suspense
of
that
day
,
and
the
shock
which
follow
,
be
almost
the
bad
that
we
undergo
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
ten
o'clock
that
the
first
telegram
come
;
<EOS>
an
hour
later
the
wire
announce
that
the
admiral
have
signal
to
form
line
of
battle
,
and
shortly
afterwards
that
the
order
be
give
to
bear
down
on
the
enemy
and
engage
.
<EOS>
at
twelve
come
the
announcement
,
"
Fleet
open
fire
<EOS>
about
three
mile
to
leeward
of
us"--that
be
,
the
ship
with
the
cable
.
<EOS>
so
far
all
have
be
expectancy
,
then
come
the
first
token
of
calamity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
an
ironclad
have
be
blow
up"--"the
enemy
's
torpedo
be
do
great
damage"--"the
flag
-
ship
be
lay
aborad
<EOS>
the
enemy"--"the
flag
-
ship
appear
to
be
sinking"--"the
vice
-
admiral
have
signal
to"--there
the
cable
become
silent
,
and
,
as
you
know
,
we
hear
no
more
till
,
two
day
afterwards
,
the
solitary
ironclad
which
escape
the
disaster
steam
into
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
then
the
whole
story
come
out
--
how
our
sailor
,
gallant
as
ever
,
have
try
to
close
with
the
enemy
;
how
the
latter
evade
the
conflict
at
close
quarter
,
and
,
sheer
off
,
leave
behind
them
the
fatal
engine
which
send
our
ship
,
one
after
the
other
,
to
the
bottom
;
how
all
this
happen
almost
in
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
the
Government
,
it
appear
,
have
receive
warning
of
this
invention
;
but
to
the
nation
this
stunning
blow
be
utterly
unexpected
.
<EOS>
that
Thursday
I
have
to
go
home
early
for
regimental
drill
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
remain
do
nothing
,
so
when
that
be
over
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
town
again
,
and
after
wait
in
expectation
of
news
which
never
come
,
and
miss
the
midnight
train
,
I
walk
home
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
hot
sultry
night
,
and
I
do
not
arrive
till
near
sunrise
.
<EOS>
the
whole
town
be
quite
still
--
the
lull
before
the
storm
;
and
as
I
let
myself
in
with
my
latch
-
key
,
and
go
<EOS>
softly
up-
<EOS>
stair
to
my
room
to
avoid
wake
the
sleeping
household
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
but
contrast
the
peacefulness
of
the
morning
--
no
sound
break
the
silence
<EOS>
but
the
singing
of
the
bird
in
the
garden
--
with
the
passionate
remorse
and
indignation
that
would
break
out
with
the
day
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
inmate
of
the
room
be
as
wakeful
as
myself
;
but
the
house
in
its
stillness
be
just
as
it
use
to
be
when
I
come
home
alone
from
ball
or
party
in
the
happy
day
go
by
.
<EOS>
tired
though
I
be
,
I
could
not
sleep
,
so
I
go
down
to
the
river
and
have
a
swim
;
and
on
return
find
the
household
be
assemble
for
early
breakfast
.
<EOS>
a
sorrowful
household
it
be
,
although
the
burden
press
on
each
be
partly
an
unseen
one
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
doubt
whether
his
firm
could
last
through
the
day
;
my
mother
,
her
distress
about
my
brother
,
now
with
his
regiment
on
the
coast
,
already
exceed
that
which
she
feel
for
the
public
misfortune
,
have
come
down
,
although
hardly
fit
to
leave
her
room
.
<EOS>
My
sister
Clara
be
bad
of
all
,
for
she
could
not
but
try
to
disguise
her
special
interest
in
the
fleet
;
and
though
we
have
all
guess
that
her
heart
be
give
to
the
young
lieutenant
in
the
flag
-
ship
--
the
first
vessel
to
go
down
--
a
love
unclaimed
could
not
be
tell
,
nor
could
we
express
the
sympathy
we
feel
for
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
that
breakfast
,
the
last
meal
we
ever
have
together
,
be
soon
end
,
and
my
father
and
I
go
up
to
town
by
an
early
train
,
and
get
there
just
as
the
fatal
announcement
of
the
loss
of
the
fleet
be
telegraph
from
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
the
panic
and
excitement
of
that
day
--
how
the
fund
go
down
to
35
;
the
run
upon
the
bank
and
its
stoppage
;
the
fall
of
half
the
house
in
the
city
;
how
the
Government
issue
a
notification
suspend
specie
payment
and
the
tendering
of
bill
--
this
last
precaution
too
late
for
most
firm
,
Graham
&
Co.
among
the
number
,
which
stop
payment
as
soon
as
my
father
get
to
the
office
;
the
call
to
arm
,
and
the
unanimous
response
of
the
country
--
all
this
be
history
which
I
need
not
repeat
.
<EOS>
You
wish
to
hear
about
my
own
share
in
the
business
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
well
,
volunteer
have
increase
immensely
from
the
day
war
be
proclaim
,
and
our
regiment
go
up
in
a
day
or
two
from
its
usual
strength
of
600
to
nearly
1000
.
<EOS>
but
the
stock
of
rifle
be
deficient
.
<EOS>
We
be
promise
a
further
supply
in
a
few
day
,
which
however
,
we
never
receive
;
and
while
wait
for
them
the
regiment
have
to
be
divide
into
two
part
,
the
recruit
drill
with
the
rifle
in
the
morning
,
and
we
old
hand
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
failure
and
stoppage
of
work
on
this
black
Friday
throw
an
immense
number
of
young
man
out
of
employment
,
and
we
recruit
up
to
1400
strong
by
the
next
day
;
but
what
be
the
use
of
all
these
man
without
arm
?
<EOS>
on
the
Saturday
it
be
announce
that
a
lot
of
smooth
-
bore
musket
in
store
at
the
Tower
would
be
serve
out
to
regiment
apply
for
them
,
and
a
regular
scramble
take
place
among
the
volunteer
for
them
,
and
our
people
get
hold
of
a
couple
of
hundred
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
almost
as
well
have
try
to
learn
rifle
-
drill
with
a
broom
-
stick
as
with
old
brown
bess
;
besides
,
there
be
no
smooth
-
bore
ammunition
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
a
national
subscription
be
open
for
the
manufacture
of
rifle
at
Birmingham
,
which
run
up
to
a
couple
of
million
in
two
day
,
but
,
like
everything
else
,
this
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
to
return
to
the
volunteer
:
camp
have
be
form
a
fortnight
before
at
Dover
,
Brighton
,
Harwich
,
and
other
place
,
of
regular
and
militia
,
and
the
headquarters
of
most
of
the
volunteer
regiment
be
attach
to
one
or
other
of
them
,
and
the
volunteer
themselves
use
to
go
down
for
drill
from
day
to
day
,
as
they
could
spare
time
,
and
on
Friday
an
order
go
out
that
they
should
be
permanently
embody
;
but
the
metropolitan
volunteer
be
still
keep
about
London
as
a
sort
of
reserve
,
till
it
could
be
see
at
what
point
the
invasion
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
tell
off
to
brigade
and
division
.
<EOS>
Our
brigade
consist
of
the
4th
Royal
Surrey
Militia
,
the
1st
Surrey
Administrative
Battalion
,
as
it
be
call
,
at
Clapham
,
the
7th
Surrey
Volunteers
at
southwark
,
and
ourselves
;
but
only
our
battalion
and
the
militia
be
quarter
in
the
same
place
,
and
the
whole
brigade
have
merely
two
or
three
afternoon
together
at
brigade
exercise
in
Bushey
Park
before
the
march
take
place
.
<EOS>
Our
brigadier
belong
to
a
line
regiment
in
Ireland
,
and
do
not
join
till
the
very
morning
the
order
come
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
during
the
preliminary
fortnight
,
the
militia
colonel
command
.
<EOS>
but
though
we
volunteer
be
busy
with
our
drill
and
preparation
,
those
of
us
who
,
like
myself
,
belong
to
Government
office
,
have
more
than
enough
of
office
work
to
do
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
the
volunteer
clerk
be
allow
to
leave
office
at
four
o'clock
,
but
the
rest
be
keep
hard
at
the
desk
far
into
the
night
.
<EOS>
order

the
lord

lieutenant

to
the
magistrate
,
notification

all
the
arrangement

clean
out
the
workhouse
for
hospital
--
these
and
a
hundred
other
thing
have
to
be
manage
in
our
office
,
and
there
be
as
much
bustle
indoor
as
out

<EOS>
fortunate
we
be
to
be
<EOS>
so
busy--
<EOS>
the
people
to
be
pity
be
those
who
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
on
Sunday
(
that
be
the
15th
August
)
<EOS>
work
go
on
just
as
usual
.
<EOS>
We
have
an
early
parade
and
drill
,
and
I
go
up
to
town
by
the
nine
o'clock
train
in
my
uniform
,
take
my
rifle
with
me
in
case
of
accident
,
and
luckily
too
,
as
it
turn
out
,
a
mackintosh
overcoat
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
to
Waterloo
there
be
all
sort
of
rumour
afloat
.
<EOS>
a
fleet
have
be
see
off
the
Downs
,
and
some
of
the
despatch
-
boat
which
be
hover
about
the
coast
bring
news
that
there
be
a
large
flotilla
off
Harwich
,
but
nothing
could
be
see
from
the
shore
,
as
the
weather
be
hazy
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
's
light
ship
have
take
and
sink
all
the
fishing
-
boat
they
could
catch
,
to
prevent
the
news
of
their
whereabout
reach
us
;
but
a
few
escape
during
the
night
and
report
that
the
inconstant
frigate
come
home
from
North
America
,
without
any
knowledge
of
what
have
take
place
,
have
sail
right
into
the
enemy
's
fleet
and
be
capture
.
<EOS>
in
town
the
troop
be
all
get
ready
for
a
move
;
the
Guards
in
the
Wellington
Barracks
be
under
arm
,
and
their
baggage
-
waggon
pack
and
draw
up
in
the
bird
-
cage
walk
.
<EOS>
the
usual
guard
at
the
Horse
Guards
have
be
withdraw
,
and
orderly
and
staff
-
officer
be
go
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
all
this
I
see
on
the
way
to
my
office
,
where
I
work
away
till
twelve
o'clock
,
and
then
feel
hungry
after
my
early
breakfast
<EOS>
,
I
go
across
Parliament
Street
to
my
club
to
get
some
luncheon
.
<EOS>
there
be
about
half
-
a
-
dozen
man
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
none
of
whom
I
know
;
but
in
a
minute
or
two
danver
of
the
Treasury
enter
in
a
tremendous
hurry
.
<EOS>
from
him
I
get
the
first
bit
of
authentic
news
I
have
have
that
day
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
have
land
in
force
near
Harwich
,
and
the
metropolitan
regiment
be
order
down
there
to
reinforce
the
troop
already
collect
in
that
neighbourhood
;
his
regiment
be
to
parade
at
one
o'clock
,
and
he
have
come
to
get
something
to
eat
before
start
.
<EOS>
We
bolt
a
hurried
lunch
,
and
be
just
leave
the
club
when
a
messenger
from
the
Treasury
come
run
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Danvers
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
come
to
look
for
you
,
sir
;
the
secretary
say
that
all
the
gentleman
be
want
at
the
office
,
and
that
you
must
please
not
one
of
you
go
with
the
regiment
.
<EOS>
""the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
know
if
that
order
extend
to
all
the
public
office
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
know
,
"
say
the
man
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
believe
it
do
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
<EOS>
messenger
go
round
to
all
the
club
and
luncheon
-
bar
to
look
for
the
gentleman
;
the
secretary
say
it
be
quite
impossible
any
one
can
be
spare
just
now
<EOS>
,
there
be
so
much
work
to
do
;
there
be
order
<EOS>
just
come
to
send
off
our
record
to
Birmingham
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
wait
to
condole
with
danver
,
but
,
just
glance
up
Whitehall
to
see
if
any
of
our
messenger
be
in
pursuit
,
I
run
off
as
hard
as
I
could
for
Westminister
Bridge
,
and
so
to
the
Waterloo
station
.
<EOS>
the
place
have
quite
change
its
aspect
since
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
regular
service
of
train
have
cease
,
and
the
station
and
approach
be
full
of
troop
,
among
them
the
Guards
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
everything
be
very
orderly
:
the
man
have
pile
arm
,
and
be
stand
about
in
group
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
of
high
spirit
or
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
matter
have
become
too
serious
.
<EOS>
every
man
's
face
reflect
the
general
feeling
that
we
have
neglect
the
warning
give
us
,
and
that
now
the
danger
so
long
deride
as
impossible
and
absurd
have
really
come
and
find
us
unprepared
.
<EOS>
but
the
soldier
,
if
grave
,
look
determined
,
like
man
who
mean
to
do
their
duty
whatever
may
happen
.
<EOS>
a
train
full
of
guardsman
be
just
start
for
Guildford
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
it
would
stop
at
Surbiton
,
and
,
with
several
other
volunteer
,
hurry
like
myself
to
join
our
regiment
,
get
a
place
in
it
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
arrive
a
moment
too
soon
,
for
the
regiment
be
march
from
Kingston
down
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
the
destination
of
our
brigade
be
the
east
coast
.
<EOS>
empty
carriage
be
draw
up
in
the
siding
,
and
our
regiment
be
to
go
first
.
<EOS>
a
large
crowd
be
assemble
to
see
it
off
,
include
the
recruit
who
have
join
during
the
last
fortnight
,
and
who
form
by
far
the
large
part
of
our
strength
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
stay
behind
,
and
be
certainly
very
much
in
the
way
already
;
for
as
all
the
officer
and
sergeant
belong
to
the
active
part
,
there
be
no
one
to
keep
discipline
among
them
,
and
they
come
crowd
around
us
,
break
the
rank
and
make
it
difficult
to
get
into
the
train
.
<EOS>
here
I
see
our
new
brigadier
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
soldier
-
like
man
,
and
no
doubt
know
his
duty
,
but
he
appear
new
to
volunteer
,
and
do
not
seem
to
know
how
to
deal
with
gentleman
private
.
<EOS>
I
want
very
much
to
run
home
and
get
my
greatcoat
and
knapsack
,
which
I
have
buy
a
few
day
ago
,
but
fear
to
be
leave
behind
;
a
good
-
natured
recruit
volunteer
to
fetch
them
for
me
,
but
he
have
not
return
before
we
start
,
and
I
begin
the
campaign
with
a
kit
consist
of
a
mackintosh
and
a
small
pouch
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
tremendous
squeeze
in
the
train
;
for
,
besides
the
ten
man
sit
down
,
there
be
three
or
four
stand
up
in
every
compartment
,
and
the
afternoon
be
close
and
sultry
,
and
there
be
so
many
stoppage
on
the
way
that
we
take
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
crawl
up
to
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
It
be
between
five
and
six
in
the
afternoon
when
we
arrive
there
,
and
it
be
nearly
seven
before
we
march
up
to
the
Shoreditch
station
.
<EOS>
the
whole
place
be
fill
up
with
store
and
ammunition
,
to
be
send
off
to
the
east
,
so
we
pile
arm
in
the
street
and
scatter
about
to
get
food
and
drink
,
of
which
most
of
us
stand
in
need
,
especially
the
latter
,
for
some
be
already
feel
the
bad
for
the
heat
and
crush
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
step
into
a
public
-
house
with
Travers
,
when
who
should
drive
up
but
his
pretty
wife
?
<EOS>
Most
of
our
friend
have
pay
their
adieu
at
the
Surbiton
station
,
but
she
have
drive
up
by
the
road
in
his
brougham
,
bring
their
little
boy
to
have
a
last
look
at
papa
.
<EOS>
She
have
also
bring
his
knapsack
and
greatcoat
,
and
,
what
be
still
more
acceptable
,
a
basket
contain
fowl
,
tongue
,
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
and
biscuit
,
and
a
couple
of
bottle
of
claret,---which
priceless
luxury
they
insist
on
my
sharing
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
hour
go
on
.
<EOS>
the
4th
Surrey
Militia
,
which
have
march
all
the
way
from
Kingston
,
have
come
up
,
as
well
as
the
other
volunteer
corp
;
the
station
have
be
partly
clear
of
the
store
that
encumber
it
;
some
artillery
,
two
militia
regiment
,
and
a
battalion
of
the
line
,
have
be
despatch
,
and
our
turn
to
start
have
come
,
and
long
line
of
carriage
be
draw
up
ready
for
us
;
but
still
we
remain
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
You
may
fancy
the
scene
.
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
as
many
people
as
ever
in
London
,
and
we
could
hardly
move
for
the
crowd
of
spectator
--
fellow
hawk
fruit
and
volunteer
'
comfort
,
newsboy
and
so
forth
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
cab
and
omnibus
;
while
orderly
and
staff
-
officer
be
constantly
ride
up
with
message
.
<EOS>
a
good
many
of
the
militiaman
,
and
some
of
our
people
too
,
have
take
more
than
enough
to
drink
;
perhaps
a
hot
sun
have
tell
on
empty
stomach
;
anyhow
,
they
become
very
noisy
.
<EOS>
the
din
,
dirt
,
and
heat
be
indescribable
.
<EOS>
so
the
evening
wear
on
,
and
all
the
information
our
officer
could
get
from
the
brigadier
,
who
appear
to
be
act
under
another
general
,
be
,
that
order
have
come
to
stand
fast
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
gradually
the
street
become
quieter
and
cooler
.
<EOS>
the
brigadier
,
who
,
by
way
of
set
an
example
,
have
remain
for
some
hour
without
leave
his
saddle
,
have
get
a
chair
out
of
a
shop
,
and
sit
nod
in
it
;
most
of
the
man
be
lie
down
or
sit
on
the
pavement
--
<EOS>
some
sleeping
,
some
smoking
.
<EOS>
in
vain
have
traver
beg
his
wife
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
She
declare
that
,
have
come
so
far
,
she
would
stay
and
see
the
last
of
us
.
<EOS>
the
brougham
have
be
send
away
to
a
by-
street
,
as
it
block
up
the
road
;
so
he
sit
on
a
doorstep
,
she
by
him
on
the
knapsack
.
<EOS>
little
Arthur
,
who
have
be
delight
at
the
bustle
and
the
uniform
,
and
in
high
spirit
,
become
at
last
very
cross
,
and
eventually
cry
himself
to
sleep
in
his
father
's
arm
,
his
golden
hair
and
one
little
dimpled
arm
hang
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
thus
go
on
the
weary
hour
,
till
suddenly
the
assembly
sound
,
and
we
all
start
up
.
<EOS>
We
be
to
return
to
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
the
landing
on
the
east
be
only
a
feint
--
so
run
the
rumour
--
the
real
attack
be
on
the
south
.
<EOS>
anything
seem
well
than
indecision
and
delay
,
and
,
tired
though
we
be
,
the
march
back
be
gladly
hail
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Travers
,
who
make
us
take
the
remain
of
the
luncheon
with
us
,
we
leave
to
look
for
her
carriage
;
little
Arthur
,
who
be
awake
again
,
but
very
good
and
quiet
,
in
her
arm
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
reach
Waterloo
till
nearly
midnight
,
and
there
be
some
delay
in
start
again
.
<EOS>
several
volunteer
and
militia
regiment
have
arrive
from
the
north
;
the
station
and
all
its
approach
be
jam
up
with
man
,
and
train
be
be
despatch
away
as
fast
as
they
could
be
make
up
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
no
news
have
reach
us
since
the
first
announcement
;
but
the
excitement
then
arouse
have
now
pass
away
under
the
influence
of
fatigue
and
want
of
sleep
,
and
most
of
us
doze
off
as
soon
as
we
get
under
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
at
any
rate
,
and
be
awake
by
the
train
stop
at
Leatherhead
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
up
-
train
return
to
town
,
and
some
person
in
it
be
bring
up
news
from
the
coast
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
,
from
our
part
of
the
train
,
hear
what
they
say
,
but
the
rumour
be
pass
up
from
one
carriage
to
another
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
have
land
in
force
at
Worthing
.
<EOS>
Their
position
have
be
attack
by
the
troop
from
the
camp
near
Brighton
,
and
the
action
would
be
renew
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
volunteer
have
behave
very
well
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
information
we
could
get
.
<EOS>
so
,
then
,
the
invasion
have
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
,
at
any
rate
,
from
what
be
say
,
that
the
enemy
have
not
be
drive
back
yet
,
and
we
should
be
in
time
most
likely
to
take
a
share
in
the
defence
.
<EOS>
It
be
sunrise
when
the
train
crawl
into
Dorking
,
for
there
have
be
numerous
stoppage
on
the
way
;
and
here
it
be
pull
up
for
a
long
time
,
and
we
be
tell
to
get
out
and
stretch
ourselves
--
<EOS>
an
order
gladly
respond
to
,
for
we
have
be
very
closely
pack
all
night
.
<EOS>
Most
of
us
,
too
,
take
the
opportunity
to
make
an
early
breakfast
off
the
food
we
have
bring
from
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
remain
of
Mrs
Travers
's
fowl
and
some
bread
wrap
up
in
my
waterproof
,
which
I
share
with
one
or
two
less
provident
comrade
.
<EOS>
We
could
see
from
our
halting
-
place
that
the
line
be
block
with
train
beyond
and
behind
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
about
eight
o'clock
when
we
get
order
to
take
our
seat
again
,
and
the
train
begin
to
move
slowly
on
towards
Horsham
.
<EOS>
Horsham
Junction
be
the
point
to
be
occupy
--
so
the
rumour
go
;
but
about
ten
o'clock
,
when
halt
at
a
small
station
a
few
mile
short
of
it
,
the
order
come
to
leave
the
train
,
and
our
brigade
form
in
column
on
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
beyond
us
be
some
field-
artillery
;
and
further
on
,
so
we
be
tell
by
a
staff
-
officer
,
another
brigade
,
which
be
to
make
up
a
division
with
ours
.
<EOS>
after
more
delay
the
line
begin
to
move
,
but
not
forwards
;
our
route
be
towards
the
north
-
west
,
and
a
sort
of
suspicion
of
the
state
of
affair
flash
across
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Horsham
be
already
occupy
by
the
enemy
's
advanced-
guard
,
and
we
be
to
fall
back
on
Leith
Common
,
and
take
up
a
position
threaten
his
flank
,
should
he
advance
either
to
Guildford
or
Dorking
.
<EOS>
this
be
soon
confirm
by
what
the
colonel
be
tell
by
the
brigadier
and
pass
down
the
rank
;
and
just
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
boom
of
artillery
come
up
on
the
light
south
breeze
.
<EOS>
in
about
an
hour
the
firing
cease
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
We
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
our
march
continue
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
very
close
and
sultry
,
and
the
cloud
of
dust
stir
up
by
our
foot
almost
suffocate
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
save
a
soda
-
water
-
bottleful
of
yesterday
's
claret
;
but
this
go
only
a
short
way
,
for
there
be
many
mouth
to
share
it
with
,
and
the
thirst
soon
become
as
bad
as
ever
.
<EOS>
several
of
the
regiment
fall
out
from
faintness
,
and
we
make
frequent
halt
to
rest
and
let
the
straggler
come
up
.
<EOS>
at
last
we
reach
the
top
of
Leith
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
striking
spot
,
be
the
high
point
in
the
south
of
England
.
<EOS>
the
view
from
it
be
splendid
,
and
most
lovely
do
the
country
look
this
summer
day
,
although
the
grass
be
brown
from
the
long
drought
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
relief
to
get
from
the
dusty
road
on
to
the
common
,
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
there
be
a
refreshing
breeze
.
<EOS>
We
could
see
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
whole
of
our
division
.
<EOS>
Our
own
regiment
do
not
muster
more
than
500
,
for
it
contain
a
large
number
of
Government
office
man
who
have
be
detain
,
like
danver
,
for
duty
in
town
,
and
other
be
not
much
large
;
but
the
militia
regiment
be
very
strong
,
and
<EOS>
the
whole
division
,
I
be
tell
,
muster
nearly
5000
rank
and
file
.
<EOS>
We
could
see
other
troop
also
in
extension
of
our
division
,
and
could
count
a
couple
of
field
-
battery
of
Royal
Artillery
,
besides
some
heavy
gun
,
belong
to
the
volunteer
apparently
,
draw
by
carthorse
.
<EOS>
the
cool
air
,
the
sense
of
number
,
and
the
evident
strength
of
the
position
we
hold
,
raise
our
spirit
,
which
,
I
be
not
ashamed
to
say
,
have
all
the
morning
be
depressed
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
we
be
not
eager
to
close
with
the
enemy
,
but
that
the
counter
-
march
and
halt
ominously
betoken
a
vacillation
of
purpose
in
those
who
have
the
guidance
of
affair
.
<EOS>
here
in
two
day
the
invader
have
get
more
than
twenty
mile
inland
,
and
nothing
effectual
have
be
do
to
stop
them
.
<EOS>
and
the
ignorance
in
which
we
volunteer
,
from
the
colonel
downward
,
be
keep
of
their
movement
,
fill
us
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
but
depict
to
ourselves
the
enemy
as
carry
out
all
the
while
firmly
his
well
-
consider
scheme
of
attack
,
and
contrast
it
with
our
own
uncertainty
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
very
silence
with
which
his
advance
appear
to
be
conduct
fill
us
with
mysterious
awe
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
day
wear
on
,
and
we
become
faint
with
hunger
,
for
we
have
eat
nothing
since
daybreak
.
<EOS>
no
provision
come
up
,
and
there
be
no
sign
of
any
commissariat
officer
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
when
we
be
at
the
Waterloo
station
a
whole
trainful
of
provision
be
draw
up
there
,
and
our
colonel
propose
that
one
of
the
truck
should
be
take
off
and
attach
to
our
train
,
so
that
we
may
have
some
food
at
hand
;
but
the
officer
in
charge
,
an
assistant
-
controller
<EOS>
I
think
they
call
him
--
this
control
department
be
a
newfangle
affair
which
do
us
almost
as
much
harm
as
the
enemy
in
the
long
-
run
--
say
his
order
be
to
keep
all
the
store
together
,
and
that
he
could
not
issue
any
without
authority
from
the
head
of
his
department
.
<EOS>
so
we
have
to
go
without
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
tobacco
smoke
---
indeed
there
be
no
solace
like
a
pipe
under
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
militia
regiment
,
I
hear
afterwards
,
have
two
day
'
provision
in
their
haversack
;
it
be
we
volunteer
who
have
no
haversack
,
and
nothing
to
put
in
them
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
I
should
tell
you
,
while
we
be
lie
on
the
grass
with
our
arm
pile
,
the
General
,
with
the
brigadier
and
staff
,
be
ride
about
slowly
from
point
to
point
of
the
edge
of
the
common
,
look
out
with
his
glass
towards
the
south
valley
.
<EOS>
orderly
and
staff-
officer
be
constantly
come
,
and
about
three
o'clock
there
arrive
up
a
road
that
lead
towards
Horsham
a
small
body
of
lancer
and
a
regiment
of
yeomanry
,
who
have
<EOS>
,
it
appear
,
be
out
in
advance
,
and
now
draw
up
a
short
way
in
front
of
us
in
column
face
to
the
south
.
<EOS>
whether
they
could
see
anything
in
their
front
I
could
not
tell
,
for
we
be
behind
the
crest
of
the
hill
ourselves
,
and
so
could
not
look
into
the
valley
below
;
but
shortly
afterwards
the
assembly
sound
.
<EOS>
commanding
officer
be
call
out
by
the
General
,
and
receive
some
brief
instruction
;
and
the
column
begin
to
march
again
towards
London
,
the
militia
this
time
come
last
in
our
brigade
.
<EOS>
a
rumour
regard
the
object
of
this
counter
-
march
soon
spread
through
the
rank
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
be
not
go
to
attack
us
here
,
but
be
try
to
turn
the
position
on
both
side
,
one
column
point
to
Reigate
,
the
other
to
Aldershot
;
and
so
we
must
fall
back
and
take
up
a
position
at
Dorking
.
<EOS>
the
line
of
the
great
chalk
-
range
be
to
be
defend
.
<EOS>
a
large
force
be
concentrate
at
Guildford
,
another
at
Reigate
,
and
we
should
find
support
at
Dorking
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
would
be
await
in
these
position
.
<EOS>
such
,
so
far
as
we
private
could
get
at
the
fact
,
be
to
be
the
plan
of
operation
.
<EOS>
down
the
hill
,
therefore
,
we
march
.
<EOS>
from
one
or
two
point
we
could
catch
a
brief
sight
of
the
railway
in
the
valley
below
run
from
Dorking
to
Horsham
.
<EOS>
man
in
red
be
work
upon
it
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
Royal
Engineers
,
some
one
say
,
break
up
the
line
.
<EOS>
on
we
march
.
<EOS>
the
dust
seem
bad
than
ever
.
<EOS>
in
one
village
through
which
we
pass
--
I
forget
the
name
now
--
there
be
a
pump
on
the
green
.
<EOS>
here
we
stop
and
have
a
good
drink
;
and
pass
by
a
large
farm
,
the
farmer
's
wife
and
two
or
three
of
her
maid
stand
at
the
gate
and
hand
us
hunch
of
bread
and
cheese
out
of
some
basket
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
share
of
a
bit
,
but
the
bottom
of
the
good
woman
's
basket
must
soon
have
be
reach
.
<EOS>
not
a
thing
else
be
to
be
have
till
we
get
to
Dorking
about
six
o'clock
;
indeed
most
of
the
farm
-
house
appear
desert
already
.
<EOS>
on
arrive
there
we
be
draw
up
in
the
street
,
and
just
opposite
be
a
baker
's
shop
.
<EOS>
Our
fellow
ask
leave
at
first
by
two
and
three
to
go
in
and
buy
some
loaf
,
but
soon
other
begin
to
break
off
and
crowd
into
the
shop
,
and
at
last
a
regular
scramble
take
place
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
any
order
preserve
,
and
a
regular
distribution
arrange
,
they
would
no
doubt
have
be
steady
enough
,
but
hunger
make
man
selfish
;
each
man
feel
that
his
stopping
behind
would
do
no
good
--
he
would
simply
lose
his
share
;
so
it
end
by
almost
the
whole
regiment
join
in
the
scrimmage
,
and
the
shop
be
clear
out
in
a
couple
of
minute
;
while
as
for
pay
,
you
could
not
get
your
hand
into
your
pocket
for
the
crush
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
try
in
vain
to
stop
the
row
;
some
of
the
officer
be
as
bad
as
the
man
.
<EOS>
just
then
a
staff
-
officer
ride
by
;
he
could
scarcely
make
way
for
the
crowd
,
and
be
push
against
rather
rudely
,
and
in
a
passion
he
call
out
to
us
to
behave
properly
,
like
soldier
,
and
not
like
a
parcel
of
rough
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
blow
it
,
governor
,
"
say
Dick
Wake
,
"
you
be
not
agoe
to
come
between
a
poor
cove
and
his
grub
.
<EOS>
"
Wake
be
an
article
attorney
,
and
,
as
we
use
to
say
in
those
day
,
a
cheeky
young
chap
,
although
a
good
-
natured
fellow
enough
.
<EOS>
at
this
speech
,
which
be
follow
by
some
more
remark
of
the
sort
from
those
about
him
,
the
staff
-
officer
become
angrier
still
.
<EOS>
"
orderly
,
"
cry
he
to
the
lancer
ride
behind
him
,
"
take
that
man
to
the
provostmarshal
.
<EOS>
as
for
you
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
our
colonel
,
who
sit
on
his
horse
silent
with
astonishment
,
"
if
you
do
not
want
some
of
your
man
shoot
before
their
time
,
you
and
your
precious
officer
have
better
keep
this
rabble
in
a
little
well
order
;
"
and
poor
Dick
,
who
look
crestfallen
enough
,
would
certainly
have
be
lead
off
at
the
tail
of
the
sergeant
's
horse
,
if
the
brigadier
have
not
come
up
and
arrange
matter
,
and
march
us
off
to
the
hill
beyond
the
town
.
<EOS>
this
incident
make
us
both
angry
and
crestfallen
.
<EOS>
We
be
annoy
at
be
so
roughly
speak
to
:
at
the
same
time
we
feel
we
have
deserve
it
,
and
be
ashamed
of
the
misconduct
.
<EOS>
then
,
too
,
we
have
lose
confidence
in
our
colonel
,
after
the
poor
figure
he
cut
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
fellow
,
the
colonel
,
and
show
himself
a
brave
one
next
day
;
but
he
aim
too
much
at
be
popular
,
and
do
not
understand
a
bit
how
to
command
.
<EOS>
to
resume:--We
have
scarcely
reach
the
hill
above
the
town
,
which
we
be
tell
be
to
be
our
bivouac
for
the
night
,
when
the
welcome
news
come
that
a
food
-
train
have
arrive
at
the
station
;
but
there
be
no
cart
to
bring
the
thing
up
,
so
a
fatigue
-
party
go
down
and
carry
back
a
supply
to
us
in
their
arms,--loave
,
a
barrel
of
rum
,
packet
of
tea
,
and
joint
of
meat
--
abundance
for
all
;
but
there
be
not
a
kettle
or
a
cooking
-
pot
in
the
regiment
,
and
we
could
not
eat
the
meat
raw
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
and
officer
be
no
well
off
.
<EOS>
They
have
arrange
to
have
a
regular
mess
,
with
crockery
,
steward
,
and
all
complete
,
but
the
establishment
never
turn
up
,
and
what
have
become
of
it
no
one
know
.
<EOS>
some
of
us
be
send
back
into
the
town
to
see
what
we
could
procure
in
the
way
of
cooking
utensil
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
street
full
of
artillery
,
baggage
-
waggon
,
and
mount
officer
,
and
volunteer
shop
like
ourselves
;
and
all
the
house
appear
to
be
occupy
by
troop
.
<EOS>
We
succeed
in
get
a
few
kettle
and
saucepan
,
and
I
obtain
for
myself
a
leather
bag
,
with
a
strap
to
go
over
the
shoulder
,
which
prove
very
handy
afterwards
;
and
thus
laden
<EOS>
,
we
trudge
back
to
our
camp
on
the
hill
,
fill
the
kettle
with
dirty
water
from
a
little
stream
which
run
between
the
hill
and
the
town
,
for
there
be
none
to
be
have
above
.
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
a
couple
of
mile
each
way
;
and
,
exhaust
as
we
be
with
marching
and
want
of
rest
,
we
be
almost
too
tired
to
eat
.
<EOS>
the
cooking
be
of
the
roughest
,
as
you
may
suppose
;
all
we
could
do
be
to
cut
off
slice
of
the
meat
and
boil
them
in
the
saucepan
,
use
our
finger
for
fork
.
<EOS>
the
tea
,
however
,
be
very
refreshing
;
and
,
thirsty
as
we
be
,
we
drink
it
by
the
gallon
.
<EOS>
just
before
it
grow
dark
,
the
brigade
-
major
come
round
,
and
,
with
the
adjutant
,
show
our
colonel
how
to
set
a
picket
in
advance
of
our
line
a
little
way
down
the
face
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
to
place
one
,
I
suppose
,
because
the
town
in
our
front
be
still
occupy
with
troop
;
but
no
doubt
the
practice
would
be
useful
.
<EOS>
We
have
also
a
quarter-
guard
,
and
a
line
of
sentry
in
front
and
rear
of
our
line
,
communicate
with
those
of
the
regiment
on
our
flank
.
<EOS>
Firewood
be
plentiful
,
for
the
hill
be
cover
with
beautiful
wood
;
but
it
take
some
time
to
collect
it
,
for
we
have
nothing
but
our
pocket
-
knife
to
cut
down
the
branch
with
.
<EOS>
so
we
lay
down
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
My
company
have
no
duty
,
and
we
have
the
night
undisturbed
to
ourselves
;
but
,
tired
though
I
be
,
the
excitement
and
the
novelty
of
the
situation
make
sleep
difficult
.
<EOS>
and
although
the
night
be
still
and
warm
,
and
we
be
shelter
by
the
wood
,
I
soon
find
it
chilly
with
no
better
cover
than
my
thin
dust
-
coat
,
the
more
so
as
my
clothe
,
saturate
with
perspiration
during
the
day
,
have
never
dry
;
and
before
daylight
I
wake
from
a
short
nap
,
shiver
with
cold
,
and
be
glad
to
get
warm
with
other
by
a
fire
.
<EOS>
I
then
notice
that
the
opposite
hill
on
the
south
be
dot
with
fire
;
and
we
think
at
first
they
must
belong
to
the
enemy
,
but
we
be
tell
that
the
ground
up
there
be
still
hold
by
a
strong
rear
-
guard
of
regular
,
and
that
there
need
be
no
fear
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
sign
of
dawn
the
bugle
of
the
regiment
sound
the
reveillé
,
and
we
be
order
to
fall
in
,
and
the
roll
be
call
.
<EOS>
about
twenty
man
be
absent
,
who
have
fall
out
sick
the
day
before
;
they
have
be
send
up
to
London
by
train
during
the
night
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
after
stand
in
column
for
about
half
an
hour
,
the
brigademajor
come
down
with
order
to
pile
arm
and
stand
easy
;
and
perhaps
half
an
hour
afterwards
we
be
tell
to
get
breakfast
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
to
cook
a
day
's
food
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
this
operation
be
manage
pretty
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
evening
before
,
except
that
we
have
our
cooking
pot
and
kettle
ready
.
<EOS>
meantime
there
be
leisure
to
look
around
,
and
from
where
we
stand
there
be
a
commanding
view
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
scene
in
England
.
<EOS>
Our
regiment
be
draw
up
on
the
extremity
of
the
ridge
which
run
from
Guildford
to
Dorking
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
merely
a
part
of
the
great
chalk
-
range
which
extend
from
beyond
Aldershot
east
to
the
Medway
;
but
there
be
a
gap
in
the
ridge
just
here
where
the
little
stream
that
run
past
Dorking
turn
suddenly
to
the
north
,
to
find
its
way
to
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
We
stand
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
,
as
it
trend
down
eastward
towards
this
gap
,
and
have
pass
our
bivouac
in
what
appear
to
be
a
gentleman
's
park
.
<EOS>
a
little
way
above
us
,
and
to
our
right
,
be
a
very
fine
country
-
seat
to
which
the
part
be
attach
,
now
occupy
by
the
headquarters
of
our
division
.
<EOS>
from
this
house
the
hill
slope
steeply
down
southward
to
the
valley
below
,
which
run
nearly
east
and
west
parallel
to
the
ridge
,
and
carry
the
railway
and
the
road
from
Guildford
to
reigate
;
and
in
which
valley
,
immediately
in
front
of
the
chateau
,
and
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
from
it
,
be
the
little
town
of
Dorking
,
nestle
in
the
tree
,
and
rise
up
the
foot
of
the
slope
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
which
stretch
away
to
Leith
Common
,
the
scene
of
yesterday
's
march
.
<EOS>
thus
the
main
part
of
the
town
of
Dorking
be
on
our
right
front
,
but
the
suburb
stretch
away
eastward
nearly
to
our
proper
front
,
culminate
in
a
small
railway
station
,
from
which
the
grassy
slope
of
the
park
rise
up
dot
with
shrub
and
tree
to
where
we
be
stand
.
<EOS>
round
this
railway
station
be
a
cluster
of
villas
and
one
or
two
mill
,
of
whose
garden
we
thus
have
a
bird's
-
eye
view
,
their
little
ornamental
pond
glisten
like
look
-
glass
in
the
morning
sun
.
<EOS>
immediately
on
our
left
the
park
slope
steeply
down
to
the
gap
before
mention
,
through
which
run
the
little
stream
,
as
well
as
the
railway
from
Epsom
to
Brighton
,
nearly
due
north
and
south
,
meet
the
Guildford
and
Reigate
line
at
right
angle
.
<EOS>
close
to
the
point
of
intersection
and
the
little
station
already
mention
,
be
the
station
of
the
former
line
where
we
have
stop
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
beyond
the
gap
on
the
east
(
our
left
)
,
and
in
continuation
of
our
ridge
,
rise
the
chalk
-
hill
again
.
<EOS>
the
shoulder
of
this
ridge
overlook
the
gap
be
call
Box
Hill
,
from
the
shrubbery
of
boxwood
with
which
it
be
cover
.
<EOS>
Its
side
be
very
steep
,
and
the
top
of
the
ridge
be
cover
with
troop
.
<EOS>
the
natural
strength
of
our
position
be
manifest
at
a
glance
;
a
high
grassy
ridge
steep
to
the
south
,
with
a
stream
in
front
,
and
but
little
cover
up
the
side
.
<EOS>
It
seem
make
for
a
battle
-
field
.
<EOS>
the
weak
point
be
the
gap
;
the
ground
at
the
junction
of
the
railway
and
the
road
immediately
at
the
entrance
of
the
gap
form
a
little
valley
,
dot
,
as
I
have
say
,
with
building
and
garden
.
<EOS>
this
,
in
one
sense
,
be
the
key
of
the
position
;
for
although
it
would
not
be
tenable
while
we
hold
the
ridge
command
it
,
the
enemy
by
carry
this
point
and
advance
through
the
gap
would
cut
our
line
in
two
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
suppose
I
scan
the
ground
thus
critically
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
anybody
,
indeed
,
may
have
be
strike
with
the
natural
advantage
of
our
position
;
but
what
,
as
I
remember
,
most
impress
me
,
be
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene
--
the
little
town
with
the
outline
of
the
house
obscure
by
a
blue
mist
,
the
massive
crispness
of
the
foliage
,
the
outline
of
the
great
tree
,
light
up
by
the
sun
,
and
relieve
by
deep
-
blue
shade
.
<EOS>
so
thick
be
the
timber
here
,
rise
up
the
southern
slope
of
the
valley
,
that
it
look
almost
as
if
it
may
have
be
a
primeval
forest
.
<EOS>
the
quiet
of
the
scene
be
the
more
impressive
because
contrast
in
the
mind
with
the
scene
we
expect
to
follow
;
and
I
can
remember
,
as
if
it
be
yesterday
,
the
sensation
of
bitter
regret
that
it
should
now
be
too
late
to
avert
this
come
desecration
of
our
country
,
which
may
so
easily
have
be
prevent
.
<EOS>
a
little
firmness
,
a
little
prevision
on
the
part
of
our
ruler
,
even
a
little
common-
sense
,
and
this
great
calamity
would
have
be
render
utterly
impossible
.
<EOS>
too
late
,
alas
!
<EOS>
We
be
like
the
foolish
virgin
in
the
parable
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
suppose
the
scene
immediately
around
be
gloomy
:
the
camp
be
brisk
and
bustle
enough
.
<EOS>
We
have
get
over
the
stress
of
weariness
;
our
stomach
be
full
;
we
feel
a
natural
enthusiasm
at
the
prospect
of
have
so
soon
to
take
a
part
as
the
real
defender
of
the
country
,
and
we
be
inspirit
at
the
sight
of
the
large
force
that
be
now
assemble
.
<EOS>
along
the
slope
which
trend
off
to
the
rear
of
our
ridge
,
troop
come
march
up
--
volunteer
,
militia
,
cavalry
,
and
gun
;
these
,
I
hear
,
have
come
down
from
the
north
as
far
as
Leatherhead
the
night
before
,
and
have
march
over
at
daybreak
.
<EOS>
long
train
,
too
,
begin
to
arrive
by
the
rail
through
the
gap
,
one
after
the
other
,
contain
militia
and
volunteer
,
who
move
up
to
the
ridge
to
the
right
and
leave
,
and
take
up
their
position
,
mass
for
the
most
part
on
the
slope
which
run
up
from
,
and
in
rear
of
,
where
we
stand
.
<EOS>
We
now
form
part
of
an
army
corps
,
we
be
tell
,
consist
of
three
division
,
but
what
regiment
compose
the
other
two
division
I
never
hear
.
<EOS>
all
this
movement
we
could
distinctly
see
from
our
position
,
for
we
have
hurry
over
our
breakfast
,
expect
every
minute
that
the
battle
would
begin
,
and
now
stand
or
sit
about
on
the
ground
near
our
pile
arm
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
too
,
we
see
a
very
long
train
come
along
the
valley
from
the
direction
of
Guildford
,
full
of
redcoat
.
<EOS>
It
halt
at
the
little
station
at
our
foot
,
and
the
troop
alight
.
<EOS>
We
could
soon
make
out
their
bear
-
skin
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
Guards
,
come
to
reinforce
this
part
of
the
line
.
<EOS>
leave
a
detachment
of
skirmisher
to
hold
the
line
of
the
railway
embankment
,
the
main
body
march
up
with
a
springy
step
and
with
the
band
playing
,
and
draw
up
across
the
gap
on
our
left
,
in
prolongation
of
our
line
.
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
three
battalion
of
them
,
for
they
form
up
in
that
number
of
column
at
short
interval
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
this
I
be
send
over
to
Box
Hill
with
a
message
from
our
colonel
to
the
colonel
of
a
volunteer
regiment
station
there
,
to
know
whether
an
ambulance
-
cart
be
obtainable
,
as
it
be
report
this
regiment
be
well
supply
with
carriage
,
whereas
we
be
without
any
:
my
mission
,
however
,
be
futile
.
<EOS>
cross
the
valley
,
I
find
a
scene
of
great
confusion
at
the
railway
station
.
<EOS>
train
be
still
come
in
with
store
,
ammunition
,
gun
,
and
appliance
of
all
sort
,
which
be
be
unload
as
fast
as
possible
;
but
there
be
scarcely
any
mean
of
get
the
thing
off
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
waggon
of
all
sort
,
but
hardly
any
horse
to
draw
them
,
and
the
whole
place
be
block
up
;
while
,
to
add
to
the
confusion
,
a
regular
exodus
have
take
place
of
the
people
from
the
town
,
who
have
be
warn
that
it
be
likely
to
be
the
scene
of
fighting
.
<EOS>
lady
and
woman
of
all
sort
and
age
,
and
child
,
some
with
bundle
,
some
empty
-
handed
,
be
seek
place
in
the
train
,
but
there
appear
no
one
on
the
spot
authorise
to
grant
them
,
and
these
poor
creature
be
push
their
way
up
and
down
,
vainly
ask
for
information
and
permission
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
in
the
crowd
I
observe
our
surgeon
,
who
likewise
be
in
search
of
an
ambulance
of
some
sort
:
his
whole
professional
apparatus
,
he
say
,
consist
of
a
case
of
instrument
.
<EOS>
also
in
the
crowd
I
stumble
upon
Wood
,
Travers
's
old
coachman
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
send
down
by
his
mistress
to
Guildford
,
because
it
be
suppose
our
regiment
have
go
there
,
ride
the
horse
,
and
laden
with
a
supply
of
thing
--
food
,
blanket
,
and
,
of
course
,
a
letter
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
bring
my
knapsack
;
but
at
Guildford
the
horse
be
press
for
artillery
work
,
and
a
receipt
for
it
give
him
in
exchange
,
so
he
have
be
oblige
to
leave
all
the
heavy
package
there
,
include
my
knapsack
;
but
the
faithful
old
man
have
bring
on
as
many
thing
as
he
could
carry
,
and
hear
that
we
should
be
find
in
this
part
,
have
walk
over
thus
laden
from
Guildford
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
place
be
crowd
with
troop
,
and
that
the
height
be
line
with
them
the
whole
way
between
the
two
town
;
also
,
that
some
train
with
wound
have
pass
up
from
the
coast
in
the
night
,
through
Guildford
.
<EOS>
I
lead
him
off
to
where
our
regiment
be
,
relieve
the
old
man
from
part
of
the
load
he
be
stagger
under
.
<EOS>
the
food
send
be
not
now
so
much
need
,
but
the
plate
,
knife
,
and
drinking
-
vessel
,
promise
to
be
handy
--
and
traver
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
,
be
delighted
to
get
his
letter
;
while
a
couple
of
newspaper
the
old
man
have
bring
be
eagerly
compete
for
by
all
,
even
at
this
critical
moment
,
for
we
have
hear
no
authentic
news
since
we
leave
London
on
Sunday
.
<EOS>
and
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
although
I
only
glance
down
the
paper
,
I
can
remember
almost
the
very
word
I
read
there
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
copy
of
the
same
paper
:
the
first
,
publish
on
Sunday
evening
,
when
the
news
have
arrive
of
the
successful
landing
at
three
point
,
be
write
in
a
tone
of
despair
.
<EOS>
the
country
must
confess
that
it
have
be
take
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
the
conqueror
would
be
satisfied
with
the
humiliation
inflict
by
a
peace
dictate
on
our
own
shore
;
it
be
the
clear
duty
of
the
Government
to
accept
the
good
term
obtainable
,
and
to
avoid
further
bloodshed
and
disaster
,
and
avert
the
fall
of
our
totter
mercantile
credit
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
's
issue
be
in
quite
a
different
tone
.
<EOS>
apparently
the
enemy
have
receive
a
check
,
for
we
be
here
exhort
to
resistance
.
<EOS>
an
impregnable
position
be
to
be
take
up
along
the
Downs
,
a
force
be
concentrate
there
far
outnumber
the
rash
invader
,
who
,
with
an
invincible
line
before
them
,
and
the
sea
behind
,
have
no
choice
between
destruction
or
surrender
.
<EOS>
let
there
be
no
pusillanimous
talk
of
negotation
,
the
fight
must
be
fight
out
;
and
there
could
be
but
one
issue
.
<EOS>
England
,
expectant
but
calm
,
await
with
confidence
the
result
of
the
attack
on
its
unconquerable
volunteer
.
<EOS>
the
writing
appear
to
me
eloquent
,
but
rather
inconsistent
.
<EOS>
the
same
paper
say
the
Government
have
send
off
500
workman
from
Woolwich
,
to
open
a
branch
arsenal
at
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
we
have
nothing
to
do
,
except
to
change
our
position
,
which
we
do
every
few
minute
,
now
move
up
the
hill
farther
to
our
right
,
now
take
ground
lower
down
to
our
left
,
as
one
order
after
another
be
bring
down
the
line
;
but
the
staff
-
officer
be
gallop
about
perpetually
with
order
,
while
the
rumble
of
the
artillery
as
they
move
about
from
one
part
of
the
field
to
another
go
on
almost
incessantly
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
whole
line
stand
to
arm
,
the
band
strike
up
,
and
the
general
command
our
army
corp
come
ride
down
with
his
staff
.
<EOS>
We
have
see
him
several
time
before
,
as
we
have
be
move
frequently
about
the
position
during
the
morning
;
but
he
now
make
a
sort
of
formal
inspection
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
thin
man
,
with
long
light
hair
,
very
well
mounted
,
and
as
he
sit
his
horse
with
an
erect
seat
,
and
come
prance
down
the
line
,
at
a
little
distance
he
look
as
if
he
may
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
;
but
I
believe
he
have
serve
more
than
fifty
year
,
and
have
be
make
a
peer
for
service
perform
when
quite
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
he
have
more
decoration
than
there
be
room
for
on
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
wear
them
suspend
like
a
necklace
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
like
all
the
other
general
,
he
be
dress
in
blue
,
with
a
cock
-
hat
and
feather
--
a
bad
plan
,
I
think
,
for
it
make
them
very
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
the
general
halt
before
our
battalion
,
and
after
look
at
us
a
while
,
make
a
short
address
:
We
have
a
post
of
honour
next
her
Majesty
's
Guards
,
and
would
show
ourselves
worthy
of
it
,
and
of
the
name
of
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
need
,
he
say
,
to
be
a
general
to
see
the
strength
of
our
position
;
it
be
impregnable
,
if
properly
hold
.
<EOS>
let
us
wait
till
the
enemy
be
well
pound
,
and
then
the
word
would
be
give
to
go
at
him
.
<EOS>
above
everything
,
we
must
be
steady
.
<EOS>
He
then
shake
hand
with
our
colonel
,
we
give
him
a
cheer
,
and
he
ride
on
to
where
the
Guards
be
draw
up
.
<EOS>
now
then
,
we
think
,
the
battle
will
begin
.
<EOS>
but
still
there
be
no
sign
of
the
enemy
;
and
the
air
,
though
hot
and
sultry
,
begin
to
be
very
hazy
,
so
that
you
could
scarcely
see
the
town
below
,
and
the
hill
opposite
be
merely
a
confused
blur
,
in
which
no
feature
could
be
distinctly
make
out
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
the
tension
of
feeling
which
follow
the
general
's
address
relaxed
,
and
we
begin
to
feel
less
as
if
everything
depend
on
keep
our
rifle
firmly
grasp
:
<EOS>
we
be
tell
to
pile
arm
again
,
and
get
leave
to
go
down
by
ten
and
twenty
to
the
stream
below
to
drink
.
<EOS>
this
stream
,
and
all
the
hedge
and
bank
on
our
side
of
it
,
be
hold
by
our
skirmisher
,
but
the
town
have
be
abandon
.
<EOS>
the
position
appear
an
excellent
one
,
except
that
the
enemy
,
when
they
come
,
would
have
almost
well
cover
than
our
man
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
down
at
the
brook
,
a
column
emerge
from
the
town
,
make
for
our
position
.
<EOS>
We
think
for
a
moment
it
be
the
enemy
,
and
you
could
not
make
out
the
colour
of
the
uniform
for
the
dust
;
but
it
turn
out
to
be
our
rearguard
,
fall
back
from
the
opposite
hill
which
they
have
occupy
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
one
battalion
,
of
rifle
,
halt
for
a
few
minute
at
the
stream
to
let
the
man
drink
,
and
I
have
a
minute
's
talk
with
a
couple
of
the
officer
.
<EOS>
They
have
form
part
of
the
force
which
have
attack
the
enemy
on
their
first
landing
.
<EOS>
They
have
it
all
their
own
way
,
they
say
,
at
first
,
and
could
have
beat
the
enemy
back
easily
if
they
have
be
properly
support
;
but
the
whole
thing
be
mismanage
.
<EOS>
the
volunteer
come
on
very
pluckily
,
they
say
,
but
they
get
into
confusion
,
and
so
do
the
militia
,
and
the
attack
fail
with
serious
loss
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
wounded
of
this
force
which
have
pass
through
Guildford
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
officer
ask
us
eagerly
about
the
arrangement
for
the
battle
,
and
when
we
say
that
the
Guards
be
the
only
regular
troop
in
this
part
of
the
field
,
shake
their
head
ominously
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
talk
,
a
third
officer
come
up
;
he
be
a
dark
man
with
a
smooth
face
and
a
curious
excited
manner
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
volunteer
,
I
suppose
,
"
he
say
,
quickly
,
his
eye
flash
the
while
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
now
,
look
here
;
mind
I
do
not
want
to
hurt
your
feeling
,
or
to
say
anything
unpleasant
,
but
I
will
tell
you
what
;
if
all
you
gentleman
be
just
to
go
back
,
and
leave
us
to
fight
it
out
alone
,
it
would
be
a
devilish
good
thing
.
<EOS>
We
could
do
it
a
precious
deal
better
without
you
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
want
your
help
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
We
would
much
rather
be
leave
alone
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
mind
I
do
not
want
to
say
anything
rude
,
but
that
be
a
fact
.
<EOS>
"
have
blurt
out
this
passionately
,
he
stride
away
before
any
one
could
reply
,
or
the
other
officer
could
stop
him
.
<EOS>
They
apologise
for
his
rudeness
,
say
that
his
brother
,
also
in
the
regiment
,
have
be
kill
on
Sunday
,
and
that
this
,
and
the
sun
,
and
marching
,
have
affect
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
officer
tell
us
that
the
enemy
's
advanced
-
guard
be
close
behind
,
but
that
he
have
apparently
be
wait
for
reinforcement
,
and
would
probably
not
attack
in
force
until
noon
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
nearly
three
o'clock
before
the
battle
begin
.
<EOS>
We
have
almost
wear
out
the
feeling
of
expectancy
.
<EOS>
for
twelve
hour
have
we
be
wait
for
the
come
struggle
,
till
at
last
it
seem
almost
as
if
the
invasion
be
but
a
bad
dream
,
and
the
enemy
,
as
yet
unseen
by
us
,
have
no
real
existence
.
<EOS>
so
far
thing
have
not
be
very
different
,
but
for
the
number
and
for
what
we
have
be
tell
,
from
a
Volunteer
review
on
Brighton
Downs
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
these
thought
be
pass
through
my
mind
as
we
lay
down
in
group
on
the
grass
,
some
smoking
,
some
nibbling
at
their
bread
,
some
even
asleep
,
when
the
listless
state
we
have
fall
into
be
suddenly
disturb
by
a
gunshot
fire
from
the
top
of
the
hill
on
our
right
,
close
by
the
big
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
I
have
ever
hear
a
shot
gun
fire
,
and
although
it
be
fifty
year
ago
,
the
angry
whistle
of
the
shot
as
it
leave
the
gun
be
in
my
ear
now
.
<EOS>
the
sound
be
soon
to
become
common
enough
.
<EOS>
We
all
jump
up
at
the
report
,
and
fall
in
almost
without
the
word
be
give
,
grasp
our
rifle
tightly
,
and
the
lead
file
peer
forward
to
look
for
the
approach
enemy
.
<EOS>
this
gun
be
apparently
the
signal
to
begin
,
for
now
our
battery
open
fire
all
along
the
line
.
<EOS>
what
they
be
fire
at
I
could
not
see
,
and
I
be
sure
the
gunner
could
not
see
much
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
what
a
haze
have
come
over
the
air
since
the
morning
,
and
now
the
smoke
from
the
gun
settle
like
a
pall
over
the
hill
,
and
soon
we
could
see
little
but
<EOS>
the
man
in
our
rank
,
and
the
outline
of
some
gunner
in
the
battery
draw
up
next
us
on
the
slope
on
our
right
.
<EOS>
this
firing
go
on
,
I
should
think
,
for
nearly
a
couple
of
hour
,
and
still
there
be
no
reply
.
<EOS>
We
could
see
the
gunner
--
it
be
a
troop
of
horse
-
artillery
--
work
away
like
fury
,
ram
,
loading
,
and
run
up
with
cartridge
,
the
officer
in
command
ride
slowly
up
and
down
just
behind
his
gun
,
and
peer
out
with
his
field
-
glass
into
the
mist
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
they
cease
fire
to
let
their
smoke
clear
away
,
but
this
do
not
do
much
good
.
<EOS>
for
nearly
two
hour
do
this
go
on
,
and
not
a
shot
come
in
reply
.
<EOS>
if
a
battle
be
like
this
,
say
Dick
Wake
,
who
be
my
next
-
hand
file
<EOS>
,
it
be
mild
work
,
to
say
the
least
.
<EOS>
the
word
be
hardly
utter
when
a
rattle
of
musketry
be
hear
in
front
;
our
skirmisher
be
at
it
,
and
very
soon
the
bullet
begin
to
sing
over
our
head
,
and
some
strike
the
ground
at
our
foot
.
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
we
have
be
in
column
;
we
be
now
deploy
into
line
on
the
ground
assign
to
us
.
<EOS>
from
the
valley
or
gap
on
our
left
there
run
a
lane
right
up
the
hill
almost
due
west
,
or
along
our
front
.
<EOS>
this
lane
have
a
thick
bank
about
four
foot
high
,
and
the
great
part
of
the
regiment
be
draw
up
behind
it
;
but
a
little
way
up
the
hill
the
lane
trend
back
out
of
the
line
,
so
the
right
of
the
regiment
here
leave
it
and
occupy
the
open
grass
-
land
of
the
park
.
<EOS>
the
bank
have
be
cut
away
at
this
point
to
admit
of
our
go
in
and
out
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
tell
in
the
morning
to
cut
down
the
bush
on
the
top
of
the
bank
,
so
as
to
make
the
space
clear
for
fire
over
,
but
we
have
no
tool
to
work
with
;
however
,
a
party
of
sapper
have
come
down
and
finish
the
job
.
<EOS>
My
company
be
on
the
right
,
and
be
thus
beyond
the
shelter
of
the
friendly
bank
.
<EOS>
on
our
right
again
be
the
battery
of
artillery
already
mention
;
then
come
a
battalion
of
the
line
,
then
more
gun
,
then
a
great
mass
of
militia
and
volunteer
and
a
few
line
up
to
the
big
house
.
<EOS>
at
least
this
be
the
order
before
the
firing
begin
;
after
that
I
do
not
know
what
change
take
place
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
enemy
's
artillery
begin
to
open
;
where
their
gun
be
post
<EOS>
we
could
not
see
,
but
we
begin
to
hear
the
rush
of
the
shell
over
our
head
,
and
the
bang
as
they
burst
just
beyond
.
<EOS>
and
now
what
take
place
I
can
really
hardly
tell
you
.
<EOS>
sometimes
when
I
try
and
recall
the
scene
,
it
seem
as
if
it
last
for
only
a
few
minute
;
yet
I
know
,
as
we
lay
on
the
ground
,
I
think
the
hour
would
never
pass
away
,
as
we
watch
the
gunner
still
ply
their
task
,
fire
at
the
invisible
enemy
,
never
stop
for
a
moment
except
when
now
and
again
a
dull
blow
would
be
hear
and
a
man
fall
down
,
then
three
or
four
of
his
comrade
would
carry
him
to
the
rear
.
<EOS>
the
captain
no
longer
ride
up
and
down
;
what
have
become
of
him
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
gun
cease
fire
for
a
time
;
they
have
get
injure
in
some
way
,
and
up
ride
an
artillery
general
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
him
now
,
a
very
handsome
man
,
with
straight
feature
and
a
dark
mustache
,
his
breast
cover
with
medal
.
<EOS>
He
appear
in
a
great
rage
at
the
gun
stop
fire
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
command
this
battery
?
<EOS>
"
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
,
Sir
Henry
,
"
say
an
officer
,
ride
forward
,
whom
I
have
not
notice
before
.
<EOS>
the
group
be
before
me
at
this
moment
,
stand
out
clear
against
the
background
of
smoke
,
Sir
Henry
erect
on
his
splendid
charger
,
his
flashing
eye
,
his
left
arm
point
towards
the
enemy
to
enforce
something
he
be
go
to
say
,
the
young
officer
rein
in
his
horse
just
beside
him
,
and
salute
with
his
right
hand
raise
to
his
busby
.
<EOS>
this
for
a
moment
,
then
a
dull
thud
,
and
both
horse
and
rider
be
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
a
round
-
shot
have
strike
all
four
at
the
saddle
-
line
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
gunner
run
up
to
help
,
but
neither
officer
could
have
live
many
minute
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
first
I
see
kill
.
<EOS>
some
time
before
this
,
almost
immediately
on
the
enemy
's
artillery
opening
,
as
we
be
lie
,
I
hear
something
like
the
sound
of
metal
striking
metal
,
and
at
the
same
moment
Dick
Wake
,
who
be
next
me
in
the
rank
,
lean
on
his
elbow
,
sink
forward
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
and
see
what
have
happen
;
a
shot
fire
at
a
high
elevation
,
pass
over
his
head
,
have
strike
the
ground
behind
,
nearly
cut
his
thigh
off
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
the
ball
strike
his
sheathed
bayonet
which
make
the
noise
.
<EOS>
three
of
us
carry
the
poor
fellow
to
the
rear
,
with
difficulty
for
the
shattered
limb
;
but
he
be
nearly
dead
from
loss
of
blood
when
we
get
to
the
doctor
,
who
be
wait
in
a
sheltered
hollow
about
two
hundered
yard
in
rear
,
with
two
other
doctor
in
plain
clothe
,
who
have
come
up
to
help
.
<EOS>
We
desposite
our
burden
and
return
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
poor
Wake
be
sensible
when
we
leave
him
,
but
apparently
too
shake
by
the
shock
to
be
able
to
speak
.
<EOS>
wood
be
there
help
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
pay
more
visit
to
the
rear
of
the
same
sort
before
the
evening
be
over
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
we
be
lie
there
to
be
fire
at
without
return
a
shot
,
for
our
skirmisher
be
hold
the
line
of
wall
and
enclosure
below
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
bank
protect
most
of
us
,
and
the
brigadier
now
order
our
right
company
,
which
be
in
the
open
,
to
get
behind
it
also
;
and
there
we
lie
about
four
deep
,
the
shell
crash
and
bullet
whistle
over
our
head
,
but
hardly
a
man
be
touch
.
<EOS>
Our
colonel
be
,
indeed
,
the
only
one
expose
,
for
he
ride
up
and
down
the
lane
at
a
footpace
as
steady
as
a
rock
;
but
he
make
the
major
and
adjutant
dismount
,
and
take
shelter
behind
the
hedge
,
hold
their
horse
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
pleased
to
see
him
so
cool
,
and
it
restore
our
confidence
in
him
,
which
have
be
shake
yesterday
.
<EOS>
the
time
seem
interminable
while
we
lay
thus
inactive
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
,
of
course
,
help
peer
over
the
bank
to
try
and
see
what
be
go
on
;
but
there
be
nothing
to
be
make
out
,
for
now
a
tremendous
thunderstorm
,
which
have
be
gather
all
day
,
burst
on
us
,
and
a
torrent
of
almost
blind
rain
come
down
,
which
obscure
the
view
even
more
than
the
smoke
,
while
the
crashing
of
the
thunder
and
the
glare
of
the
lightning
could
be
hear
and
see
even
above
the
roar
and
flashing
of
the
artillery
.
<EOS>
once
the
mist
lift
,
and
I
see
for
a
minute
an
attack
on
Box
Hill
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
gap
on
our
left
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
scene
at
a
theatre
--
a
curtain
of
smoke
all
round
and
a
clear
gap
in
the
centre
,
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
evening
sunshine
light
it
up
.
<EOS>
the
steep
smooth
slope
of
the
hill
be
crowd
with
the
dark
-
blue
figure
of
the
enemy
,
whom
I
now
see
for
the
first
time
--
an
irregular
outline
in
front
,
but
very
solid
in
rear
:
the
whole
body
be
move
forward
by
fit
and
start
,
the
man
fire
and
advance
,
the
officer
wave
their
sword
,
the
column
close
up
and
gradually
make
way
.
<EOS>
Our
people
be
almost
conceal
by
the
bush
at
the
top
,
whence
<EOS>
the
smoke
and
their
fire
could
be
see
proceed
:
presently
from
these
bush
on
the
crest
come
out
a
red
line
,
and
dash
down
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
a
flame
of
fire
belch
out
from
the
front
as
it
advance
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
hesitate
,
give
way
,
and
finally
run
back
in
a
confused
crowd
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
then
the
mist
cover
the
scene
,
but
the
glimpse
of
this
splendid
charge
be
inspirit
,
and
I
hope
we
should
show
the
same
coolness
when
it
come
to
our
turn
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
this
time
that
our
skirmisher
fall
back
,
a
good
many
wound
,
some
limping
along
by
themselves
,
other
help
.
<EOS>
the
main
body
retire
in
very
fair
order
,
halt
to
turn
round
and
fire
;
we
could
see
a
mount
officer
of
the
Guards
ride
up
and
down
encourage
them
to
be
steady
.
<EOS>
now
come
our
turn
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
we
see
nothing
,
but
a
rattle
of
bullet
come
through
the
rain
and
mist
,
mostly
,
however
,
pass
over
the
bank
.
<EOS>
We
begin
to
fire
in
reply
,
step
up
against
the
bank
to
fire
,
and
stoop
down
to
load
;
but
our
brigade
-
major
ride
up
with
an
order
,
and
the
word
be
pass
through
the
man
to
reserve
our
fire
.
<EOS>
in
a
very
few
moment
it
must
have
be
that
,
when
order
to
stand
up
,
we
could
see
the
helmet-
spike
and
<EOS>
then
the
figure
of
the
skirmisher
as
they
come
on
<EOS>
:
a
lot
of
them
there
appear
to
be
,
five
or
six
deep
I
should
say
,
but
in
loose
order
,
each
man
stop
to
aim
and
fire
,
and
then
come
forward
a
little
.
<EOS>
just
then
the
brigadier
clatter
on
horseback
up
the
lane
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
then
,
gentleman
,
give
it
them
hot
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
;
and
fire
away
<EOS>
we
do
,
as
fast
as
ever
we
be
able
.
<EOS>
a
perfect
storm
of
bullet
seem
to
be
fly
about
us
too
,
and
I
think
each
moment
must
be
the
last
;
escape
seem
impossible
,
but
I
see
no
one
fall
,
for
I
be
too
busy
,
and
so
be
we
all
,
to
look
to
the
right
or
leave
,
but
load
and
fire
as
fast
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
how
long
this
go
on
<EOS>
I
know
not
--
it
could
not
have
be
long
;
neither
side
could
have
last
many
minute
under
such
a
fire
,
but
it
end
by
the
enemy
gradually
fall
back
,
and
as
soon
as
we
see
this
we
raise
a
tremendous
shout
,
and
some
of
us
jump
up
on
the
bank
to
give
them
our
parting
shot
.
<EOS>
suddenly
the
order
be
pass
down
the
line
to
cease
firing
,
and
we
soon
discover
the
cause
;
a
battalion
of
the
Guards
be
charge
obliquely
across
from
our
left
across
our
front
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
expect
,
their
flank
attack
as
much
as
our
fire
which
have
turn
back
the
enemy
;
and
it
be
a
splendid
sight
to
see
their
steady
line
as
they
advance
slowly
across
the
smooth
lawn
below
us
,
fire
as
they
go
,
but
as
steady
as
if
on
parade
.
<EOS>
We
feel
a
great
elation
at
this
moment
;
it
seem
as
if
the
battle
be
win
.
<EOS>
just
then
somebody
call
out
to
look
to
the
wounded
,
and
for
the
first
time
I
turn
to
glance
down
the
rank
along
the
lane
.
<EOS>
then
I
see
that
we
have
not
beat
back
the
attack
without
loss
.
<EOS>
immediately
before
me
lie
Bob
Lawford
of
my
office
,
dead
on
his
back
from
a
bullet
through
his
forehead
,
his
hand
still
grasp
his
rifle
.
<EOS>
at
every
step
be
some
friend
or
acquaintance
kill
or
wound
,
and
a
few
pace
down
the
lane
<EOS>
I
find
traver
,
sit
with
his
back
against
the
bank
.
<EOS>
a
ball
have
go
through
his
lung
,
and
blood
be
come
from
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
I
be
lift
him
up
,
but
the
cry
of
agony
he
give
stop
me
.
<EOS>
I
then
see
that
this
be
not
his
only
wound
;
his
thigh
be
smash
by
a
bullet
(
which
must
have
hit
him
when
stand
on
the
bank
)
,
and
the
blood
stream
down
mixed
in
a
muddy
puddle
with
the
rain
-
water
under
him
.
<EOS>
still
he
could
not
be
leave
here
,
so
,
lift
him
up
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
carry
him
through
the
gate
which
lead
out
of
the
lane
at
the
back
to
where
our
camp
hospital
be
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
the
movement
must
have
cause
him
awful
agony
,
for
I
could
not
support
the
break
thigh
,
and
he
could
not
restrain
his
groan
,
brave
fellow
though
he
be
;
but
how
I
carry
him
at
all
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
out
,
for
he
be
a
much
big
man
than
myself
;
but
I
have
not
go
far
,
one
of
a
stream
of
our
fellow
,
all
on
the
same
errand
,
when
a
bandsman
and
wood
meet
me
,
bring
a
hurdle
as
a
stretcher
,
and
on
this
we
place
him
.
<EOS>
wood
have
just
time
to
tell
me
that
he
have
get
a
cart
down
in
the
hollow
,
and
would
endeavour
to
take
off
his
master
at
once
to
Kingston
,
when
a
staff
-
officer
ride
up
to
call
us
to
the
rank
.
<EOS>
"
You
really
must
not
straggle
in
this
way
,
gentleman
,
"
he
say
;
"
pray
keep
your
rank
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
we
can
not
leave
our
wound
to
be
trodden
down
and
die
,
"
cry
one
of
our
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
beat
off
the
enemy
first
,
sir
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
gentleman
,
do
,
pray
,
join
your
regiment
,
or
we
shall
be
a
regular
mob
.
"
<EOS>
and
no
doubt
he
do
not
speak
too
soon
;
for
besides
our
fellow
straggle
to
the
rear
,
lot
of
volunteer
from
the
regiment
in
reserve
be
run
forward
to
help
,
till
the
whole
ground
be
dot
with
group
of
man
.
<EOS>
I
hasten
back
to
my
post
,
but
I
have
just
time
to
notice
that
all
the
ground
in
our
rear
be
occupy
by
a
thick
mass
of
troop
,
much
more
numerous
than
in
the
morning
,
and
a
column
be
move
down
to
the
left
of
our
line
,
to
the
ground
before
hold
by
the
Guards
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
although
the
musketry
have
slacken
,
the
artillery
-
fire
seem
heavy
than
ever
;
the
shell
scream
overhead
or
burst
around
;
and
I
confess
to
feel
quite
a
relief
at
get
back
to
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
lane
.
<EOS>
look
over
the
bank
,
I
notice
for
the
first
time
the
frightful
execution
our
fire
have
create
.
<EOS>
the
space
in
front
be
thickly
strew
with
dead
and
badly
wound
,
and
beyond
the
body
of
the
fall
enemy
could
just
be
see
--
for
it
be
now
get
dusk
--
the
bear
-
skin
and
red
coat
of
our
own
gallant
guard
scatter
over
the
slope
,
and
mark
the
line
of
their
victorious
advance
.
<EOS>
but
hardly
a
minute
could
have
pass
in
thus
look
over
the
field
,
when
our
brigade
-
major
come
move
up
the
lane
on
foot
<EOS>
(
I
suppose
his
horse
have
be
shoot
)
,
cry
,
"
stand
to
your
arm
,
volunteer
!
<EOS>
they
be
come
on
again
;
"
and
we
find
ourselves
a
second
time
engage
in
a
hot
musketry
-
fire
.
<EOS>
how
long
it
go
on
I
can
not
now
remember
,
but
we
could
distinguish
clearly
the
thick
line
of
skirmisher
,
about
sixty
pace
off
,
and
mount
officer
among
them
;
and
we
seem
to
be
keep
them
well
in
check
,
for
they
be
quite
expose
to
our
fire
,
while
we
be
protect
nearly
up
to
our
shoulder
,
when
--
I
know
not
how
--
I
become
sensible
that
something
have
go
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
take
in
flank
!
"
call
out
some
one
;
and
look
along
the
left
,
sure
enough
there
be
dark
figure
jump
over
the
bank
into
the
lane
and
fire
up
along
our
line
.
<EOS>
the
volunteer
in
reserve
,
who
have
come
down
to
take
the
place
of
the
Guards
,
must
have
give
way
at
this
point
;
the
enemy
's
skirmisher
have
get
through
our
line
,
and
turn
our
left
flank
.
<EOS>
how
the
next
move
come
about
I
can
not
recollect
,
or
whether
it
be
without
order
,
but
in
a
short
time
we
find
ourselves
out
of
the
lane
,
and
draw
up
in
a
stranggling
line
about
thirty
yard
in
rear
of
it
--
at
our
end
,
that
is
,
the
other
flank
have
fall
back
a
good
deal
more
---
and
the
enemy
be
line
the
hedge
,
and
number
of
them
pass
over
and
form
up
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
beyond
our
leave
a
confused
mass
be
retreat
,
fire
as
they
go
,
follow
by
the
advance
line
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
We
stand
in
this
way
for
a
short
space
,
fire
at
random
as
fast
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
Our
colonel
and
major
must
have
be
shoot
,
for
there
be
no
one
to
give
an
order
,
when
somebody
on
horseback
call
out
from
behind
<EOS>
--
I
think
it
must
have
be
the
brigadier--"Now
,
then
,
volunteer
!
<EOS>
give
a
british
,
cheer
,
and
go
at
them
--
charge
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
with
a
shout
,
we
rush
at
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
run
,
some
stop
to
meet
us
,
and
for
a
moment
it
be
a
real
hand
-
to
-
hand
fight
.
<EOS>
I
feel
a
sharp
sting
in
my
leg
,
as
I
drive
my
bayonet
right
through
the
man
in
front
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
shut
my
eye
,
<EOS>
for
I
just
get
a
glimpse
of
the
poor
wretch
as
he
fall
back
,
his
eye
start
out
of
his
head
,
and
,
savage
though
we
be
,
the
sight
be
almost
too
horrible
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
but
the
struggle
be
over
in
a
second
,
and
we
have
clear
the
ground
again
right
up
to
the
rear
hedge
of
the
lane
.
<EOS>
have
we
go
on
<EOS>
,
I
believe
we
may
have
recover
the
lane
too
,
but
we
be
now
all
out
of
order
;
there
be
no
one
to
say
what
to
do
;
the
enemy
begin
to
line
the
hedge
and
open
fire
,
and
they
be
stream
past
our
left
;
and
how
it
come
about
I
know
not
,
but
we
find
ourselves
fall
back
towards
our
right
rear
,
scarce
any
semblance
of
a
line
remain
,
and
the
volunteer
who
have
give
way
on
our
left
mix
up
with
us
,
and
add
to
the
confusion
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
nearly
dark
.
<EOS>
on
the
slope
which
we
be
retreat
to
be
a
large
mass
of
reserve
draw
up
in
column
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
lead
file
of
these
,
mistake
us
for
the
enemy
,
begin
fire
at
us
;
our
fellow
,
cry
out
to
them
to
stop
,
run
towards
their
rank
,
and
in
a
few
moment
the
whole
slope
of
the
hill
become
a
scene
of
confusion
that
I
can
not
attempt
to
describe
,
regiment
and
detachment
mix
up
in
hopeless
disorder
.
<EOS>
Most
of
us
,
I
believe
,
turn
towards
the
enemy
and
fire
away
our
few
remain
cartridge
;
but
it
be
too
late
to
take
aim
,
fortunately
for
us
,
or
the
gun
which
the
enemy
have
bring
up
through
the
gap
,
and
be
fire
point
-
blank
,
would
have
do
more
damage
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
we
could
see
little
more
than
the
bright
flash
of
their
fire
.
<EOS>
in
our
confusion
we
have
jam
up
a
line
regiment
immediately
behind
us
,
which
I
suppose
have
just
arrive
on
the
field
,
and
its
colonel
and
some
staff
-
officer
be
in
vain
try
to
make
a
passage
for
it
,
and
their
shout
to
us
to
march
to
the
rear
and
clear
a
road
could
be
hear
above
the
roar
of
the
gun
and
the
confused
babel
of
sound
.
<EOS>
at
last
a
mount
officer
push
his
way
through
,
follow
by
a
company
in
section
,
the
man
brush
past
with
firm
-
set
face
,
as
if
on
a
desperate
task
;
and
the
battalion
,
when
it
get
clear
,
appear
to
deploy
and
advance
down
the
slope
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
a
dim
recollection
of
see
the
Life
Guards
trot
past
the
front
,
and
push
on
towards
the
town
--
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
save
the
day--
before
we
leave
the
field
.
<EOS>
Our
adjutant
,
who
have
get
separate
from
our
flank
of
the
regiment
in
the
confusion
,
now
come
up
,
and
manage
to
lead
us
,
or
at
any
rate
some
of
us
,
up
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
the
rear
,
to
re
-
form
,
as
he
say
;
but
there
we
meet
a
vast
crowd
of
volunteer
,
miltia
,
and
waggon
,
all
hurry
rearward
from
the
direction
of
the
big
house
,
and
we
be
bear
in
the
stream
for
a
mile
at
least
before
it
be
possible
to
stop
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
adjutant
lead
us
to
an
open
space
a
little
off
the
line
of
fugitive
,
and
there
we
re-
form
the
remain
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
tell
us
to
halt
,
he
ride
off
to
try
and
obtain
order
,
and
find
out
where
the
rest
of
our
brigade
be
.
<EOS>
from
this
point
,
a
spur
of
high
ground
run
off
from
the
main
plateau
,
we
look
down
through
the
dim
twilight
into
the
battle
-
field
below
.
<EOS>
artillery
-
fire
be
still
go
on
.
<EOS>
We
could
see
the
flash
from
the
gun
on
both
side
,
and
now
and
then
a
stray
shell
come
scream
up
and
burst
near
us
,
but
we
be
beyond
the
sound
of
musketry
.
<EOS>
this
halt
first
give
us
time
to
think
about
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
the
long
day
of
expectancy
have
be
succeed
by
the
excitement
of
battle
;
and
when
each
minute
may
be
your
last
,
you
do
not
think
much
about
other
people
,
nor
when
you
be
face
another
man
with
a
rifle
<EOS>
have
you
time
to
consider
whether
he
or
you
be
the
invader
,
or
that
you
be
fight
for
your
home
and
hearth
.
<EOS>
all
fighting
be
pretty
much
alike
,
I
suspect
,
as
to
sentiment
,
when
once
it
begin
.
<EOS>
but
now
we
have
time
for
reflection
;
and
although
we
do
not
yet
quite
understand
how
far
the
day
have
go
against
us
,
an
uneasy
feeling
of
self
-
condemnation
must
have
come
up
in
the
mind
of
most
of
us
;
while
,
above
all
,
we
now
begin
to
realise
what
the
loss
of
this
battle
mean
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
then
,
too
,
we
know
not
what
have
become
of
all
our
wound
comrade
.
<EOS>
reaction
,
too
,
set
in
after
the
fatigue
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
have
find
out
for
the
first
time
that
beside
the
bayonet
-
wound
in
my
leg
,
a
bullet
have
go
through
my
left
arm
,
just
below
the
shoulder
,
and
outside
the
bone
.
<EOS>
I
remember
feel
something
like
a
blow
just
when
we
lose
the
lane
,
but
the
wound
pass
unnoticed
till
now
,
when
the
bleeding
have
stop
and
the
shirt
be
stick
to
the
wound
.
<EOS>
this
half
-
hour
seem
an
age
,
and
while
we
stand
on
this
knoll
the
endless
tramp
of
man
and
rumble
of
cart
along
the
down
besides
us
tell
their
own
tale
.
<EOS>
the
whole
army
be
fall
back
.
<EOS>
at
last
we
could
discern
the
adjutant
ride
up
to
us
out
of
the
dark
.
<EOS>
the
army
be
to
retreat
and
take
up
a
position
on
Epsom
Downs
,
he
say
;
we
should
join
in
the
march
,
and
try
and
find
our
brigade
in
the
morning
;
and
so
we
turn
into
the
throng
again
,
and
make
our
way
on
as
best
we
could
.
<EOS>
a
few
scrap
of
news
he
give
us
as
he
ride
alongside
of
our
lead
section
;
the
army
have
hold
its
position
well
for
a
time
,
but
the
enemy
have
at
last
break
through
the
line
between
us
and
Guildford
,
as
well
as
in
our
front
,
and
have
pour
his
man
through
the
point
gain
,
throw
the
line
into
confusion
,
and
the
first
army
corps
near
Guildford
be
also
fall
back
to
avoid
be
outflank
.
<EOS>
the
regular
troop
be
hold
the
rear
;
we
be
to
push
on
as
fast
as
possible
to
get
out
of
their
way
,
and
allow
them
to
make
an
orderly
retreat
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
gallant
old
lord
command
our
corp
have
be
badly
wound
early
in
the
day
,
he
hear
,
and
carry
off
the
field
.
<EOS>
the
Guards
have
suffer
dreadfully
;
the
household
cavalry
have
ride
down
the
cuirassier
,
but
have
get
into
broken
ground
and
be
awfully
cut
up
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
scrap
of
news
pass
down
our
weary
column
.
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
our
wound
no
one
know
,
and
no
one
like
to
ask
.
<EOS>
so
we
trudge
on
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
midnight
when
we
reach
Leatherhead
.
<EOS>
here
we
leave
the
open
ground
and
take
to
the
road
,
and
the
block
become
great
.
<EOS>
We
push
our
way
painfully
along
;
several
train
pass
slowly
ahead
along
the
railway
by
the
roadside
,
contain
the
wound
,
we
suppose
--
<EOS>
such
of
them
,
at
least
,
as
be
lucky
enough
to
be
pick
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
daylight
when
we
get
to
Epsom
.
<EOS>
the
night
have
be
bright
and
clear
after
the
storm
,
with
a
cool
air
,
which
,
blow
through
my
soak
clothe
,
chill
me
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
My
wound
leg
be
stiff
and
sore
,
and
I
be
ready
to
drop
with
exhaustion
and
hunger
.
<EOS>
nor
be
my
comrade
in
much
well
case
;
we
have
eat
nothing
since
breakfast
the
day
before
,
and
the
bread
we
have
put
by
have
be
wash
away
by
the
storm
:
only
a
little
pulp
remain
at
the
bottom
of
my
bag
.
<EOS>
the
tobacco
be
all
too
wet
to
smoke
.
<EOS>
in
this
plight
we
be
creep
along
,
when
the
adjutant
guide
us
into
a
field
by
the
roadside
to
rest
awhile
,
and
we
lay
down
exhausted
on
the
sloppy
grass
.
<EOS>
the
roll
be
here
take
,
and
only
180
answer
out
of
nearly
500
present
on
the
morning
of
the
battle
.
<EOS>
how
many
of
these
be
kill
and
wound
no
one
could
tell
;
but
it
be
certain
many
must
have
get
separate
in
the
confusion
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
while
rest
here
,
we
see
pass
by
,
in
the
crowd
of
vehicle
and
man
,
<EOS>
a
cart
laden
with
commissariat
store
,
drive
by
a
man
in
uniform
.
<EOS>
"
food
!
"
cry
some
one
,
and
a
dozen
volunteer
jump
up
and
surround
the
cart
.
<EOS>
the
driver
try
to
whip
them
off
;
but
he
be
pull
off
his
seat
,
and
the
content
of
the
cart
throw
out
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
They
be
preserve
meat
in
tin
,
which
we
tear
open
with
our
bayonet
.
<EOS>
the
meat
have
be
cook
before
,
I
think
;
at
any
rate
we
devour
it
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
this
a
general
come
by
with
three
or
four
staff
-
officer
.
<EOS>
He
stop
and
speak
to
our
adjutant
,
and
then
ride
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lad
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
shall
join
my
division
for
the
present
:
fall
in
,
and
follow
the
regiment
that
be
now
pass
.
<EOS>
"
We
rise
up
,
fall
in
by
company
,
each
about
twenty
strong
,
and
turn
once
more
into
the
stream
move
along
the
road;--regiment
'
detachment
,
single
volunteer
or
militiaman
,
country
people
make
off
,
some
with
bundle
,
some
without
,
a
few
in
cart
,
but
most
on
foot
;
here
and
there
waggon
of
store
,
with
man
sit
wherever
there
be
room
,
other
cram
with
wounded
soldier
.
<EOS>
many
block
occur
from
horse
fall
,
or
cart
break
down
and
file
up
the
road
.
<EOS>
in
the
town
the
confusion
be
even
bad
,
for
all
the
house
seem
full
of
volunteer
and
militiaman
,
wound
or
rest
,
or
try
to
find
food
,
and
the
street
be
almost
choke
up
.
<EOS>
some
officer
be
in
vain
try
to
restore
order
,
but
the
task
seem
a
hopeless
one
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
volunteer
regiment
which
have
arrive
from
the
north
the
previous
night
,
and
have
be
halt
here
for
order
,
be
draw
up
along
the
roadside
steadily
enough
,
and
some
of
the
retreat
regiment
,
include
ours
,
may
have
preserve
the
semblance
of
discipline
,
but
for
the
most
part
the
mass
pushing
to
the
rear
be
a
mere
mob
.
<EOS>
the
regular
,
or
what
remain
of
them
,
be
now
,
I
believe
,
all
in
the
rear
,
to
hold
the
advance
enemy
in
check
.
<EOS>
a
few
officer
among
such
a
crowd
could
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
to
add
to
the
confusion
,
several
house
be
be
empty
of
the
wound
bring
here
the
night
before
,
to
prevent
their
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
,
some
in
cart
,
some
be
carry
to
the
railway
by
man
.
<EOS>
the
groan
of
these
poor
fellow
as
they
be
jostle
through
the
street
go
to
our
heart
,
selfish
though
fatigue
and
suffering
have
make
us
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
follow
the
guidance
of
a
staff
-
officer
who
be
stand
to
show
the
way
,
we
turn
off
from
the
main
London
road
and
take
that
towards
Kingston
.
<EOS>
here
the
crush
be
less
,
and
we
manage
to
move
along
pretty
steadily
.
<EOS>
the
air
have
be
cool
by
the
storm
,
and
there
be
no
dust
.
<EOS>
We
pass
through
a
village
where
our
new
general
have
seize
all
the
public-
house
,
and
take
possession
of
the
liquor
;
and
each
regiment
as
it
come
up
be
halt
,
and
each
man
get
a
drink
of
beer
,
serve
out
by
company
.
<EOS>
whether
the
owner
get
pay
,
I
know
not
,
but
it
be
like
nectar
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
about
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
that
we
come
in
sight
of
Kingston
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
on
our
leg
sixteen
hour
,
and
have
get
over
about
twelve
mile
of
ground
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
hill
a
little
south
of
the
Surbiton
station
,
cover
then
mostly
with
villas
,
but
open
at
the
western
extremity
,
where
there
be
a
clump
of
tree
on
the
summit
.
<EOS>
We
have
diverge
from
the
road
towards
this
,
and
here
the
general
halt
us
and
dispose
the
line
of
the
division
along
his
front
,
face
to
the
south
-
west
,
the
right
of
the
line
reach
down
to
the
water
-
work
on
the
Thames
,
the
left
extend
along
the
southern
slope
of
the
hill
,
in
the
direction
of
the
Epsom
road
by
which
we
have
come
.
<EOS>
We
be
nearly
in
the
centre
,
occupy
the
knoll
just
in
front
of
the
general
,
who
dismount
on
the
top
and
tie
his
horse
to
a
tree
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
of
a
hill
,
but
command
an
extensive
view
over
the
flat
country
around
;
and
as
we
lay
wearily
on
the
ground
we
could
see
the
Thames
glisten
like
a
silver
field
in
the
bright
sunshine
,
the
palace
at
Hampton
Court
,
the
bridge
at
Kingston
,
and
the
old
church
tower
rise
above
the
haze
of
the
town
,
with
the
wood
of
Richmond
Park
behind
it
.
<EOS>
to
most
of
us
the
scene
could
not
but
call
up
the
association
of
happy
day
of
peace
--
day
now
end
and
peace
destroy
through
national
infatuation
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
say
this
to
each
other
,
but
a
deep
depression
have
come
upon
us
,
partly
due
to
weakness
and
fatigue
,
no
doubt
,
but
we
see
that
another
stand
be
go
to
be
make
,
and
we
have
no
longer
any
confidence
in
ourselves
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
not
hold
our
own
when
stationary
in
line
,
on
a
good
position
,
but
have
be
break
up
into
a
rabble
at
the
first
shock
,
what
chance
have
we
now
of
manoeuvre
against
a
victorious
enemy
in
this
open
ground
?
<EOS>
a
feeling
of
desperation
come
over
us
,
a
determination
to
struggle
on
against
hope
;
but
anxiety
for
the
future
of
the
country
,
and
our
friend
,
and
all
dear
to
us
,
fill
our
thought
now
that
we
have
time
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
no
news
of
any
kind
since
wood
join
us
the
day
before
---
we
know
not
what
be
do
in
London
,
or
what
the
Government
be
about
,
or
anything
else
;
and
exhaust
though
we
be
,
we
feel
an
intense
craving
to
know
what
be
happen
in
other
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Our
general
have
expect
to
find
a
supply
of
food
and
ammunition
here
,
but
nothing
turn
up
.
<EOS>
Most
of
us
have
hardly
a
cartridge
leave
,
so
he
order
the
regiment
next
to
us
,
which
come
from
the
north
and
have
not
be
engage
,
to
give
us
enough
to
make
up
twenty
round
a
man
,
and
he
send
off
a
fatigue
-
party
to
Kingston
to
try
and
get
provision
,
while
a
detachment
of
our
fellow
be
allow
to
go
forage
among
the
villas
in
our
rear
;
and
in
about
an
hour
they
bring
back
some
bread
and
meat
,
which
give
us
a
slender
meal
all
round
.
<EOS>
They
say
most
of
the
house
be
empty
,
and
that
many
have
be
strip
of
all
eatable
,
and
a
good
deal
damage
already
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
between
three
and
four
o'clock
when
the
sound
of
cannonading
begin
to
be
hear
in
the
front
,
and
we
could
see
the
smoke
of
the
gun
rise
above
the
wood
of
Esher
and
Claremont
,
and
soon
afterwards
some
troop
emerge
from
the
field
below
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
rear
-
guard
of
regular
troop
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
gun
also
,
which
be
drive
up
the
slope
and
take
up
their
position
round
the
knoll
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
battery
,
but
they
only
count
eight
gun
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
behind
them
be
post
the
line
;
it
be
a
brigade
apparently
of
four
regiment
,
but
the
whole
do
not
look
to
be
more
than
eight
or
nine
hundred
man
.
<EOS>
Our
regiment
and
another
have
be
move
a
little
to
the
rear
to
make
way
for
them
,
and
presently
we
be
order
down
to
occupy
the
railway
station
on
our
right
rear
.
<EOS>
My
leg
be
now
so
stiff
I
could
no
longer
march
with
the
rest
,
and
my
left
arm
be
very
swollen
and
sore
,
and
almost
useless
;
but
anything
seem
better
than
be
leave
behind
,
so
I
limp
after
the
battalion
as
best
I
could
down
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
shed
a
little
in
advance
of
it
down
the
line
,
a
strong
brick
building
,
and
here
my
company
be
post
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
our
man
line
the
wall
of
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
a
staff-
officer
come
with
us
to
arrange
the
distribution
;
we
should
be
support
by
line
troop
,
he
say
;
and
in
few
minute
a
train
full
of
them
come
slowly
up
from
Guildford
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
;
the
man
get
out
,
the
train
pass
on
,
and
a
party
begin
to
tear
up
the
rail
,
while
the
rest
be
distribute
among
the
house
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
a
sergeant
's
party
join
us
in
our
shed
,
and
an
engineer
officer
with
sapper
come
to
knock
hole
in
the
wall
for
us
to
fire
from
;
but
there
be
only
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
them
,
so
progress
be
not
rapid
,
and
as
we
have
no
tool
we
could
not
help
.
<EOS>
It
be
while
we
be
watch
this
job
that
the
adjutant
,
who
be
as
active
as
ever
,
look
in
,
and
tell
us
to
muster
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
the
fatigue
-
party
have
come
back
from
Kingston
,
and
a
small
baker
's
hand-
cart
of
food
be
make
over
to
us
as
our
share
.
<EOS>
It
contain
loaf
,
flour
,
and
some
joint
of
meat
.
<EOS>
the
meat
and
the
flour
<EOS>
we
have
not
time
or
mean
to
cook
.
<EOS>
the
loaf
we
devour
;
and
there
be
a
tap
of
water
in
the
yard
,
so
we
feel
refresh
by
the
meal
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
to
wash
my
wound
,
which
be
become
very
offensive
,
but
I
dare
not
take
off
my
coat
,
feel
sure
I
should
not
be
able
to
get
it
on
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
while
we
be
eat
our
bread
that
the
rumour
first
reach
us
of
another
disaster
,
even
great
than
that
we
have
witness
ourselves
.
<EOS>
whence
it
come
I
know
not
;
but
a
whisper
go
down
the
rank
that
Woolwich
have
be
capture
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
it
be
our
only
arsenal
,
and
understand
the
significance
of
the
blow
.
<EOS>
no
hope
,
if
this
be
true
,
of
save
the
country
.
<EOS>
think
over
this
,
we
go
back
to
the
shed
.
<EOS>
although
this
be
only
our
second
day
of
war
,
I
think
we
be
already
old
soldier
so
far
that
we
have
come
to
be
careless
about
fire
,
and
the
shot
and
shell
that
now
begin
to
open
on
us
make
no
sensation
.
<EOS>
We
feel
,
indeed
,
our
need
of
discipline
,
and
we
see
plainly
enough
<EOS>
the
slend
chance
of
success
come
out
of
troop
so
imperfectly
train
as
we
be
;
<EOS>
but
I
think
we
be
all
determine
to
fight
on
as
long
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
Our
gallant
adjutant
give
his
spirit
to
everybody
;
and
the
staff
-
officer
commanding
be
a
very
cheery
fellow
,
and
go
about
as
if
we
be
certain
of
victory
.
<EOS>
just
as
the
firing
begin
he
look
in
to
say
that
we
be
as
safe
as
in
a
church
,
that
we
must
be
sure
and
pepper
the
enemy
well
,
and
that
more
cartridge
would
soon
arrive
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
step
and
bench
in
the
shed
,
and
on
these
a
part
of
our
man
be
stand
,
to
fire
through
the
upper
loop
-
hole
,
while
the
line
soldier
and
other
stand
on
the
ground
,
guard
the
second
row
.
<EOS>
I
sit
on
the
floor
,
for
I
could
not
now
use
my
rifle
,
and
besides
,
there
be
more
man
than
loop
-
hole
.
<EOS>
the
artillery
fire
which
have
open
now
on
our
position
be
from
a
longish
range
;
and
occupation
for
the
rifleman
have
hardly
begin
when
there
be
a
crash
in
the
shed
,
and
I
be
knock
down
by
a
blow
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
stunned
for
a
time
,
and
could
not
make
out
at
first
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
a
shot
or
shell
have
hit
the
shed
without
quite
penetrate
the
wall
,
but
the
blow
have
upset
the
step
rest
against
it
,
and
the
man
stand
on
them
,
bring
down
a
cloud
of
plaster
and
brickbat
,
one
of
which
have
strike
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
now
past
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
use
my
rifle
,
and
could
barely
stand
;
and
after
a
time
I
think
I
would
make
for
my
own
house
,
on
the
chance
of
find
some
one
still
there
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
therefore
,
and
staggered
homeward
.
<EOS>
musketry
fire
have
now
commence
,
and
our
side
be
blaze
away
from
the
window
of
the
house
,
and
from
behind
wall
,
and
from
the
shelter
of
some
truck
still
stand
in
the
station
.
<EOS>
a
couple
of
field
-
piece
in
the
yard
be
fire
,
and
in
the
open
space
in
rear
of
the
station
a
reserve
be
draw
up
.
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
be
the
staff
-
officer
on
horseback
,
watch
the
fight
through
his
field
-
glass
.
<EOS>
I
remember
have
still
enough
sense
to
feel
that
the
position
be
a
hopeless
one
.
<EOS>
that
straggle
line
of
house
and
garden
would
surely
be
break
through
at
some
point
,
and
then
the
line
must
give
way
like
a
rope
of
sand
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
a
mile
to
our
house
,
and
I
be
think
how
I
could
possibly
drag
myself
so
far
when
I
suddenly
recollect
that
I
be
pass
Travers
's
house,--one
of
the
first
of
a
row
of
villas
then
lead
from
the
Surbiton
station
to
Kingston
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
bring
home
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
as
his
faithful
old
servant
promise
,
and
be
his
wife
still
here
?
<EOS>
I
remember
to
this
day
the
sensation
of
shame
I
feel
,
when
I
recollect
that
I
have
not
once
give
him
--
my
great
friend
---
a
thought
since
I
carry
him
off
the
field
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
but
war
and
suffer
make
man
selfish
.
<EOS>
I
would
go
in
now
at
any
rate
and
rest
awhile
,
and
see
if
I
could
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
the
little
garden
before
the
house
be
as
trim
as
ever
--
I
use
to
pass
it
every
day
on
my
way
to
the
train
,
and
know
every
shrub
in
it
--
and
ablaze
with
flower
,
but
the
hall
-
door
stand
ajar
.
<EOS>
I
step
in
and
see
little
Arthur
stand
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
dress
as
neatly
as
ever
that
day
,
and
as
he
stand
there
in
his
pretty
blue
frock
and
white
trouser
and
sock
show
his
chubby
little
leg
,
with
his
golden
lock
,
fair
face
,
and
large
dark
eye
,
the
picture
of
childish
beauty
,
in
the
quiet
hall
,
just
as
it
use
to
look
--
the
vase
of
flower
,
the
hat
and
coat
hang
up
,
the
familiar
picture
on
the
wall
--
this
vision
of
peace
in
the
midst
of
war
make
me
wonder
for
a
moment
,
faint
and
giddy
as
I
be
,
if
the
pandemonium
outside
have
any
real
existence
,
and
be
not
merely
a
hideous
dream
.
<EOS>
but
the
roar
of
the
gun
make
the
house
shake
,
and
the
rushing
of
the
shot
,
give
a
ready
answer
.
<EOS>
the
little
fellow
appear
almost
unconscious
of
the
scene
around
him
,
and
be
walk
up
the
stair
hold
by
the
railing
,
one
step
at
a
time
,
as
I
have
see
him
do
a
hundred
time
before
,
but
turn
round
as
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
My
appearance
frighten
him
,
and
staggering
as
I
do
into
the
hall
,
my
face
and
clothe
cover
with
blood
and
dirt
,
I
must
have
look
an
awful
object
to
the
child
,
for
he
give
a
cry
and
turn
to
run
toward
the
basement
stair
.
<EOS>
but
he
stop
on
hear
my
voice
call
him
back
to
his
god
-
papa
,
and
after
a
while
come
timidly
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
Papa
have
be
to
the
battle
,
he
say
,
and
be
very
ill
:
<EOS>
mamma
be
with
papa
:
wood
be
out
:
<EOS>
Lucy
be
in
the
cellar
,
and
have
take
him
there
,
but
he
want
to
go
to
mamma
.
<EOS>
tell
him
to
stay
in
the
hall
for
a
minute
till
I
call
him
,
I
climb
up
-
stair
and
open
the
bedroom
-
door
.
<EOS>
My
poor
friend
lie
there
,
his
body
rest
on
the
bed
,
his
head
support
on
his
wife
's
shoulder
as
she
sit
by
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
He
breathe
heavily
,
but
the
pallor
of
his
face
,
the
closed
eye
,
the
prostrate
arm
,
the
clammy
foam
she
be
wipe
from
his
mouth
,
all
speak
of
approach
death
.
<EOS>
the
good
old
servant
have
do
his
duty
,
at
least,---he
have
bring
his
master
home
to
die
in
his
wife
's
arm
.
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
be
too
intent
on
her
charge
to
notice
the
opening
of
the
door
,
and
as
the
child
would
be
better
away
,
I
close
it
gently
and
go
down
to
the
hall
to
take
little
Arthur
to
the
shelter
below
,
where
the
maid
be
hide
.
<EOS>
too
late
!
<EOS>
He
lie
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
on
his
face
,
his
little
arm
stretch
out
,
his
hair
dabble
in
blood
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
notice
the
crash
among
the
other
noise
,
but
a
splinter
of
a
shell
must
have
come
through
the
open
doorway
;
it
have
carry
away
the
back
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
poor
child
's
death
must
have
be
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
lift
up
the
little
corpse
with
my
one
arm
,
but
even
this
load
be
too
much
for
me
,
and
while
stoop
down
<EOS>
I
faint
away
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
my
sense
again
it
be
quite
dark
,
and
for
some
time
I
could
not
make
out
where
I
be
<EOS>
;
I
lie
indeed
for
some
time
like
one
half
asleep
,
feel
no
inclination
to
move
.
<EOS>
by
degree
I
become
aware
that
I
be
on
the
carpet
floor
of
a
room
.
<EOS>
all
noise
of
battle
have
cease
,
but
there
be
a
sound
as
of
many
people
close
by
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
sit
up
and
gradually
get
to
my
foot
.
<EOS>
the
movement
give
me
intense
pain
,
for
my
wound
be
now
highly
inflame
,
and
my
clothe
stick
to
them
make
them
dreadfully
sore
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
get
up
and
grope
my
way
to
the
door
,
and
open
it
at
once
see
where
I
be
,
for
the
pain
have
bring
back
my
sense
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
lie
in
Travers
's
little
writing-
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
into
which
I
make
my
way
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
gas
,
and
the
drawing
-
room
door
be
close
;
but
from
the
open
dining-
room
the
glimmer
of
a
candle
feebly
light
up
the
hall
,
in
which
half
-
a
-
dozen
sleeping
figure
could
be
discern
,
while
the
room
itself
be
crowd
with
man
.
<EOS>
the
table
be
cover
with
plate
,
glass
,
and
bottle
;
but
most
of
the
man
be
asleep
in
the
chair
or
on
the
floor
,
a
few
be
smoke
cigar
,
and
one
or
two
with
their
helmet
on
be
still
engage
at
supper
,
occasionally
grunt
out
an
observation
between
the
mouthful
.
<EOS>
"Sind
<EOS>

say
a
broad-
shoulder
brute
,
stuff
a
great
hunch
of
beef
into
his
mouth
with
a
silver
fork
,
an
implement
I
should
think
he
must
have
be
use
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
"Ja

"
reply
a
comrade
,
who
be
loll
back
in
his
chair
with
a
pair
of
very
dirty
leg
on
the
table
,
and
one
of
poor
Travers

good
cigar
in
his
mouth
;

""Gewiss

a
hulking
lout
from
the
floor
,
lean
on
his
elbow
,
and
send
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
ugly

"What
<EOS>
more
criticism
on
the
shortcoming
of
our
unfortunate
volunteer
may
have
pass
I
do
not
stop
to
hear
,
be
interrupt
by
a
sound
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Travers
be
stand
on
the
landing
-
place
;
I
limp
up
the
stair
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
among
the
many
picture
of
those
fatal
day
engraven
on
my
memory
,
I
remember
none
more
clearly
than
the
mournful
aspect
of
my
poor
friend
,
widow
and
childless
within
a
few
moment
,
as
she
stand
there
in
her
white
dress
,
come
forth
like
a
ghost
from
the
chamber
of
the
dead
,
the
candle
she
hold
light
up
her
face
,
and
contrast
its
pallor
with
the
dark
hair
that
fall
disorder
round
it
,
its
beauty
radiant
even
through
feature
wear
with
fatigue
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
She
be
calm
and
even
tearless
,
though
the
tremble
lip
tell
of
the
effort
to
restrain
the
emotion
she
feel
.
<EOS>
"dear
friend
,
"
she
say
,
take
my
hand
,
"
I
be
come
to
seek
you
;
forgive
my
selfishness
in
neglect
you
so
long

you

at
the
door
above--"how

""Where

<EOS>
she

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
but
now
your
wound
must
be
care
for

how
pale
and
faint
you
look!--rest
here
<EOS>
a
moment,"--and
,
descend
to
the
dining

room
<EOS>
,
she
return
with
some
wine
,
which
I
gratefully
drink
,
and
then
,
make
me
sit
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
stair
,
she
bring
water
and
linen
,
and
cut
off
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
,
bathe
and
bandage
my
wound
.
<EOS>
'Twas
<EOS>
I
who
feel
selfish
for
thus
add
to
her
trouble
;
but
in
truth
I
be
too
weak
to
have
much
will
leave
,
and
stand
in
need
of
the
help
which
she
force
me
to
accept
;
and
the
dressing
of
my
wound
afford
indescribable
relief
.
<EOS>
while
thus
tend
me
,
she
explain
in
broken
sentence
how
matter
stand
.
<EOS>
every
room
but
her
own
,
and
the
little
parlour
into
which
with
Wood
's
help
she
have
carry
me
,
be
full
of
soldier
.
<EOS>
wood
have
be
take
away
to
work
at
repair
the
railroad
,
and
Lucy
have
run
off
from
fright
;
but
the
cook
have
stop
at
her
post
,
and
have
serve
up
supper
and
open
the
cellar
for
the
soldier
'
use
:
she
herself
do
not
understand
what
they
say
,
and
they
be
rough
and
boorish
,
but
not
uncivil
.
<EOS>
I
should
now
go
,
she
say
,
when
my
wound
be
dress
,
to
look
after
my
own
home
,
where
I
may
be
want
;
for
herself
,
she
wish
only
to
be
allow
to
remain
watch
there
--
glance
at
the
room
where
lie
the
body
of
her
husband
and
child
--
where
she
would
not
be
molest
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
her
advice
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
could
be
of
no
use
as
protection
,
and
I
have
an
anxious
longing
to
know
what
have
become
of
my
sick
mother
and
sister
;
besides
,
some
arrangement
must
be
make
for
the
burial
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
limp
away
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
express
thank
on
either
side
,
and
the
grief
be
too
deep
to
be
reach
by
any
outward
show
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
outside
the
house
there
be
a
good
deal
of
movement
and
bustle
;
<EOS>
many
cart
go
along
,
the
waggoner
,
from
Sussex
and
Surrey
,
evidently
impressed
and
guard
by
soldier
;
and
although
no
gas
be
burn
,
the
road
towards
Kingston
be
well
light
by
torch
hold
by
person
stand
at
short
interval
in
line
,
who
have
be
seize
for
the
duty
,
some
of
them
the
tenant
of
neighbour
villas
.
<EOS>
almost
the
first
of
these
torch
-
bearer
<EOS>
I
come
to
be
an
old
gentleman
whose
face
I
be
well
acquaint
with
,
from
have
frequently
travel
up
and
down
in
the
same
train
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
senior
clerk
in
a
Government
office
,
I
believe
,
and
be
a
mildlooke
old
man
with
a
prim
face
and
a
long
neck
,
which
he
use
to
wrap
in
a
white
double
neckcloth
,
a
thing
even
in
those
day
seldom
see
.
<EOS>
even
in
that
moment
of
bitterness
I
could
not
help
be
amuse
by
the
absurd
figure
this
poor
old
fellow
present
,
with
his
solemn
face
and
long
cravat
do
penance
with
a
torch
in
front
of
his
own
gate
,
to
light
up
the
path
of
our
conqueror
.
<EOS>
but
a
more
serious
object
now
present
itself
,
a
corporal
's
guard
pass
by
,
with
two
english
volunteer
in
charge
,
their
hand
tie
behind
their
back
.
<EOS>
They
cast
an
imploring
glance
at
me
,
and
I
step
into
the
road
to
ask
the
corporal
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
,
and
even
venture
,
as
he
be
pass
on
,
to
lay
my
hand
on
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"Auf
<EOS>
dem
Wege

"
cry
the
brute
,
lift
his
rifle
as
if
to
knock
me
down
.
"
<EOS>
Must
one
prisoner
who
fire
at
us
let
shoot
,
"
he
go
on
to
add
;
and
shoot
the
poor
fellow
would
have
be
,
I
suppose
,
if
I
have
not
intercede
with
an
officer
,
who
happen
to
be
ride
by
.
<EOS>
"Herr
Hauptmann
,
"
I
cry
,
as
loud
as
I
could
,
"
be
this
your
discipline
,
to
let
unarmed
prisoner
be
shoot
without
orders?"the
officer
,
thus
appeal
to
,
rein
in
his
horse
,
and
halt
the
guard
till
he
hear
what
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
My
knowledge
of
other
language
here
stand
me
in
good
stead
,
for
the
prisoner
,
northcountry
factory
hand
apparently
,
be
of
course
utterly
unable
to
make
themselves
understand
,
and
do
not
even
know
in
what
they
have
offend
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
interpret
their
explanation
:
they
have
be
leave
behind
while
skirmish
near
Ditton
,
in
a
barn
,
and
come
out
of
their
hiding
-
place
in
the
midst
of
a
party
of
the
enemy
,
with
their
rifle
in
their
hand
,
the
latter
thought
they
be
go
to
fire
at
them
from
behind
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
they
be
not
shoot
down
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
the
captain
hear
the
tale
,
and
then
tell
the
guard
to
let
them
go
,
and
they
slink
off
at
once
into
a
by
-
road
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
fine
soldier
-
like
man
,
but
nothing
could
exceed
the
insolence
of
his
manner
,
which
be
perhaps
all
the
great
because
it
seem
not
intentional
,
but
to
arise
from
a
sense
of
immeasurable
superiority
.
<EOS>
between
the
lame
freiwilliger
plead
for
his
comrade
,
and
the
captain
of
the
conquer
army
,
there
be
,
in
his
view
,
an
infinite
gulf
.
<EOS>
have
the
two
man
be
dog
,
their
fate
could
not
have
be
decide
more
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
They
be
let
go
simply
because
they
be
not
worth
keep
as
prisoner
,
and
perhaps
to
kill
any
live
thing
without
cause
<EOS>
go
against
the
hauptmann
's
sense
of
justice
.
<EOS>
but
why
speak
of
this
insult
in
particular
?
<EOS>
have
not
every
man
who
live
then
his
tale
to
tell
of
humiliation
and
degradation
?
<EOS>
for
it
be
the
same
story
everywhere
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
stand
in
line
,
and
when
once
they
have
get
us
on
the
march
,
the
enemy
laugh
at
us
.
<EOS>
Our
handful
of
regular
troop
be
sacrifice
almost
to
a
man
in
a
vain
conflict
with
number
;
our
volunteer
and
militia
,
with
officer
who
do
not
know
their
work
,
without
ammunition
or
equipment
,
or
staff
to
superintend
,
starve
in
the
midst
of
plenty
,
we
have
soon
become
a
helpless
mob
,
fight
desperately
here
and
there
,
but
with
whom
,
as
a
manoeuvre
army
,
the
disciplined
invader
do
just
what
they
please
.
<EOS>
happy
those
whose
bone
whiten
the
field
of
Surrey
;
they
at
least
be
spare
the
disgrace
we
live
to
endure
.
<EOS>
even
you
,
who
have
never
know
what
it
be
to
live
otherwise
than
on
sufferance
,
even
your
cheek
burn
when
we
talk
of
these
day
;
think
,
then
,
what
those
endure
who
,
like
your
grandfather
,
have
be
citizen
of
the
proud
nation
on
earth
,
which
have
never
know
disgrace
or
defeat
,
and
whose
boast
it
use
to
be
that
they
bear
a
flag
on
which
the
sun
never
set
!
<EOS>
We
have
hear
of
generosity
in
war
;
we
find
none
;
the
war
be
make
by
us
,
it
be
say
,
and
we
must
take
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
London
and
our
only
arsenal
capture
<EOS>
,
we
be
at
the
mercy
of
our
captor
,
and
right
heavily
do
they
tread
on
our
neck
.
<EOS>
need
I
tell
you
the
rest?--of
<EOS>
the
ransom
we
have
to
pay
,
and
the
taxis
raise
to
cover
it
,
which
keep
us
pauper
to
this
day?--the
brutal
frankness
that
announce
we
must
give
place
to
a
new
naval
Power
,
and
be
make
harmless
for
revenge?--the
victorious
troop
live
at
free
quarter
,
the
yoke
they
put
on
us
make
the
more
galling
that
their
requisition
have
a
semblance
of
method
and
legality
?
<EOS>
well
have
be
rob
at
first
hand
by
the
soldiery
themselves
,
than
through
our
own
magistrate
make
the
instrument
for
extortion
.
<EOS>
how
we
live
through
the
degradation
we
daily
and
hourly
underwent
,
I
hardly
even
now
understand
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
there
leave
to
us
to
live
for
?
<EOS>
strip
of
our
colony
;
Canada
and
the
West
Indies
go
to
America
;
Australia
force
to
separate
;
India
lose
for
ever
,
after
the
English
there
have
all
be
destroy
,
vainly
try
to
hold
the
country
when
cut
off
from
aid
by
their
countryman
;
Gibraltar
and
Malta
cede
to
the
new
naval
Power
;
Ireland
independent
and
in
perpetual
anarchy
and
revolution
.
<EOS>
when
I
look
at
my
country
as
it
be
now
--
its
trade
go
,
its
factory
silent
,
its
harbour
empty
,
a
prey
to
pauperism
and
decay
--
when
I
see
all
this
,
and
think
what
Great
Britain
be
in
my
youth
,
I
ask
myself
whether
I
have
really
a
heart
or
any
sense
of
patriotism
that
I
should
have
witness
such
degradation
and
still
care
to
live
!
<EOS>
France
be
different
.
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
they
have
to
eat
the
bread
of
tribulation
under
the
yoke
of
the
conqueror
!
<EOS>
their
fall
be
hardly
more
sudden
or
violent
than
ours
;
but
war
could
not
take
away
their
rich
soil
;
they
have
no
colony
to
lose
;
their
broad
land
,
which
make
their
wealth
,
remain
to
them
;
and
they
rise
again
from
the
blow
.
<EOS>
but
our
people
could
not
be
get
to
see
how
artificial
our
prosperity
be
--
that
it
all
rest
on
foreign
trade
and
financial
credit
;
that
the
course
of
trade
once
turn
away
from
us
,
even
for
a
time
,
it
may
never
return
;
and
that
our
credit
once
shake
may
never
be
restore
.
<EOS>
to
hear
man
talk
in
those
day
,
you
would
have
think
that
Providence
have
ordain
that
our
Government
should
always
borrow
at
three
per
cent
,
and
that
trade
come
to
us
because
we
live
in
a
foggy
little
island
set
in
a
boisterous
sea
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
be
get
to
see
that
the
wealth
heap
up
on
every
side
be
not
create
in
the
country
,
but
in
India
and
China
,
and
other
part
of
the
world
;
and
that
it
would
be
quite
possible
for
the
people
who
make
money
by
buy
and
sell
the
natural
treasure
of
the
earth
,
to
go
and
live
in
other
place
,
and
take
their
profit
with
them
.
<EOS>
nor
would
man
believe
that
there
could
ever
be
an
end
to
our
coal
and
iron
,
or
that
they
would
get
to
be
so
much
dearer
than
the
coal
and
iron
of
America
that
it
would
no
longer
be
worth
while
to
work
them
,
and
that
therefore
we
ought
to
insure
against
the
loss
of
our
artificial
position
as
the
great
centre
of
trade
,
by
make
ourselves
secure
and
strong
and
respected
.
<EOS>
We
think
we
be
live
in
a
commercial
millennium
,
which
must
last
for
a
thousand
year
at
least
.
<EOS>
after
all
the
bitter
part
of
our
reflection
be
,
that
all
this
misery
and
decay
may
have
be
so
easily
prevent
,
and
that
we
bring
it
about
ourselves
by
our
own
shortsighted
recklessness
.
<EOS>
there
,
across
the
narrow
Straits
,
be
the
writing
on
the
wall
,
but
we
would
not
choose
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
the
warning
of
the
few
be
drown
in
the
voice
of
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
power
be
then
pass
away
from
the
class
which
have
be
use
to
rule
,
and
to
face
political
danger
,
and
which
have
bring
the
nation
with
honour
unsullied
through
former
struggle
,
into
the
hand
of
the
low
class
,
uneducated
,
untraine
to
the
use
of
political
right
,
and
sway
by
demagogue
;
and
the
few
who
be
wise
in
their
generation
be
denounce
as
alarmist
,
or
as
aristocrat
who
seek
their
own
aggrandisement
by
waste
public
money
on
bloated
armament
.
<EOS>
the
rich
be
idle
and
luxurious
;
the
poor
grudge
the
cost
of
defence
.
<EOS>
politic
have
become
a
mere
bidding
for
radical
vote
,
and
those
who
should
have
lead
the
nation
stoop
rather
to
pander
to
the
selfishness
of
the
day
,
and
humour
the
popular
cry
which
denounce
those
who
would
secure
the
defence
of
the
nation
by
enforce
arming
of
its
manhood
,
as
interfere
with
the
liberty
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
truly
the
nation
be
ripe
for
a
fall
;
but
when
I
reflect
how
a
little
firmness
and
self
-
denial
,
or
political
courage
and
foresight
,
may
have
avert
the
disaster
,
I
feel
that
the
judgment
must
have
really
be
deserve
.
<EOS>
a
nation
too
selfish
to
defend
its
liberty
,
could
not
have
be
fit
to
retain
it
.
<EOS>
to
you
,
my
grandchild
,
who
be
now
go
to
seek
a
new
home
in
a
more
prosperous
land
,
let
not
this
bitter
lesson
be
lose
upon
you
in
the
country
of
your
adoption
.
<EOS>
for
me
,
I
be
too
old
to
begin
life
again
in
a
strange
country
;
and
hard
and
evil
as
have
be
my
day
,
it
be
not
much
to
await
in
solitude
the
time
which
can
not
now
be
far
off
,
when
my
old
bone
will
be
lay
to
rest
in
the
soil
I
have
love
so
well
,
and
whose
happiness
and
honour
I
have
so
long
survive
.
