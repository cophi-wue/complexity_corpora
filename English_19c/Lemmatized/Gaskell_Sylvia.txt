   
MONKSHAVEN
  
<EOS>
on
the
north
-
eastern
shore
of
England
there
be
a
town
call
Monkshaven
,
contain
at
the
present
day
about
fifteen
thousand
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
but
half
the
number
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
,
and
it
be
at
that
period
that
the
event
narrate
in
the
follow
page
occur
.
  
<EOS>
Monkshaven
be
a
name
not
unknown
in
the
history
of
England
,
and
tradition
of
its
have
be
the
landing
-
place
of
a
throneless
queen
be
current
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
there
have
be
a
fortified
castle
on
the
height
above
it
,
the
site
of
which
be
now
occupy
by
a
desert
manor
-
house
;
and
at
an
even
early
date
than
the
arrival
of
the
queen
and
coeval
with
the
most
ancient
remain
of
the
castle
,
a
great
monastery
have
stand
on
those
cliff
,
overlook
the
vast
ocean
that
blend
with
the
distant
sky
.
<EOS>
Monkshaven
itself
be
build
by
the
side
of
the
Dee
,
just
where
the
river
fall
into
the
German
Ocean
.
<EOS>
the
principal
street
of
the
town
run
parallel
to
the
stream
,
and
small
lane
branch
out
of
this
,
and
straggle
up
the
side
of
the
steep
hill
,
between
which
and
the
river
<EOS>
the
house
be
pen
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
bridge
across
the
Dee
,
and
consequently
a
Bridge
Street
run
at
right
angle
to
the
High
Street
;
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
stream
there
be
a
few
house
of
more
pretension
,
around
which
lie
garden
and
field
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
side
of
the
town
that
the
local
aristocracy
live
.
<EOS>
and
who
be
the
great
people
of
this
small
town
?
<EOS>
not
the
young
branch
of
the
county
family
that
hold
hereditary
state
in
their
manor
-
house
on
the
wild
bleak
moor
,
that
shut
in
Monkshaven
almost
as
effectually
on
the
land
side
as
ever
<EOS>
the
water
do
on
the
sea
-
board
.
<EOS>
no
;
these
old
family
keep
aloof
from
the
unsavoury
yet
adventurous
trade
which
bring
wealth
to
generation
after
generation
of
certain
family
in
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
the
magnate
of
Monkshaven
be
those
who
have
the
large
number
of
ship
engage
in
the
whaling
-
trade
.
<EOS>
something
like
the
following
be
the
course
of
life
with
a
Monkshaven
lad
of
this
class
:
 
<EOS>
He
be
apprentice
as
a
sailor
to
one
of
the
great
ship
-
owner
 
to
his
own
father
,
possibly
 
along
with
twenty
other
boy
,
or
,
it
may
be
,
even
more
.
<EOS>
during
the
summer
month
he
and
his
fellow
apprentice
make
voyage
to
the
Greenland
sea
,
return
with
their
cargo
in
the
early
autumn
;
and
employ
the
winter
month
in
watch
the
preparation
of
the
oil
from
the
blubber
in
the
melting
-
shed
,
and
learn
navigation
from
some
quaint
but
experienced
teacher
,
half
schoolmaster
,
half
sailor
,
who
season
his
instruction
by
stir
narration
of
the
wild
adventure
of
his
youth
.
<EOS>
the
house
of
the
ship
-
owner
to
whom
he
be
apprentice
be
his
home
and
that
of
his
companion
during
the
idle
season
between
October
and
March
.
<EOS>
the
domestic
position
of
these
boy
vary
accord
to
the
premium
pay
;
some
take
rank
with
the
son
of
the
family
,
other
be
consider
as
little
well
than
servant
.
<EOS>
yet
once
on
board
an
equality
prevail
,
in
which
,
if
any
claim
superiority
,
it
be
the
brave
and
bright
.
<EOS>
after
a
certain
number
of
voyage
the
Monkshaven
lad
would
rise
by
degree
to
be
captain
,
and
as
such
would
have
a
share
in
the
venture
;
all
these
profit
,
as
well
as
all
his
saving
,
would
go
towards
build
a
whale
vessel
of
his
own
,
if
he
be
not
so
fortunate
as
to
be
the
child
of
a
ship
-
owner
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
there
be
but
little
division
of
labour
in
the
Monkshaven
whale
fishery
.
<EOS>
the
same
man
may
be
the
owner
of
six
or
seven
ship
,
any
one
of
which
he
himself
be
fit
by
education
and
experience
to
command
;
the
master
of
a
score
of
apprentice
,
each
of
whom
pay
a
pretty
sufficient
premium
;
and
the
proprietor
of
the
melting
-
shed
into
which
his
cargo
of
blubber
and
whalebone
be
convey
to
be
fit
for
sale
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
large
fortune
be
acquire
by
these
ship
-
owner
,
nor
that
their
house
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
Dee
be
stately
mansion
,
full
of
handsome
and
substantial
furniture
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
not
surprising
that
the
whole
town
have
an
amphibious
appearance
,
to
a
degree
unusual
even
in
a
seaport
.
<EOS>
every
one
depend
on
the
whale
fishery
,
and
almost
every
male
inhabitant
have
be
,
or
hope
to
be
,
a
sailor
.
<EOS>
down
by
the
river
the
smell
be
almost
intolerable
to
any
but
Monkshaven
people
during
certain
season
of
the
year
;
but
on
these
unsavoury
"
staithe
"
the
old
man
and
child
lounge
for
hour
,
almost
as
if
they
revel
in
the
odour
of
train
-
oil
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
perhaps
,
enough
of
a
description
of
the
town
itself
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
the
country
for
mile
all
around
be
moorland
;
high
above
the
level
of
the
sea
<EOS>
tower
the
purple
crag
,
whose
summit
be
crown
with
greensward
that
steal
down
the
side
of
the
scaur
a
little
way
in
grassy
vein
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
a
brook
force
its
way
from
the
height
down
to
the
sea
,
make
its
channel
into
a
valley
more
or
less
broad
in
long
process
of
time
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
moorland
hollow
,
as
in
these
valley
,
tree
and
underwood
grow
and
flourish
;
so
that
,
while
on
the
bare
swell
of
the
high
land
you
shiver
at
the
waste
desolation
of
the
scenery
,
when
you
drop
into
these
woode
"
bottom
"
you
be
charm
with
the
nestling
shelter
which
they
give
.
<EOS>
but
above
and
around
these
rare
and
fertile
vale
there
be
moor
for
many
a
mile
,
here
<EOS>
and
there
bleak
enough
,
with
the
red
freestone
crop
out
above
the
scanty
herbage
;
then
,
perhaps
,
there
be
a
brown
tract
of
peat
and
bog
,
uncertain
footing
for
the
pedestrian
who
try
to
make
a
short
cut
to
his
destination
;
then
on
the
high
sandy
soil
there
be
the
purple
ling
,
or
common
specie
of
heather
grow
in
beautiful
wild
luxuriance
.
<EOS>
tuft
of
fine
elastic
grass
be
occasionally
to
be
find
,
on
which
the
little
black
-
face
sheep
browse
;
but
either
the
scanty
food
,
or
their
goat
-
like
agility
,
keep
them
in
a
lean
condition
that
do
not
promise
much
for
the
butcher
,
nor
yet
be
their
wool
of
a
quality
fine
enough
to
make
them
profitable
in
that
way
to
their
owner
.
<EOS>
in
such
district
there
be
little
population
at
the
present
day
;
there
be
much
less
in
the
last
century
,
before
agriculture
be
sufficiently
scientific
to
have
a
chance
of
contend
with
such
natural
disqualification
as
the
moor
present
,
and
when
there
be
no
facility
of
railroad
to
bring
sportsman
from
a
distance
to
enjoy
the
shooting
season
,
and
make
an
annual
demand
for
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
old
stone
hall
in
the
valley
;
there
be
bare
farmhouse
to
be
see
on
the
moor
at
long
distance
apart
,
with
small
stack
of
coarse
poor
hay
,
and
almost
large
stack
of
turf
for
winter
fuel
in
their
farmyard
.
<EOS>
the
cattle
in
the
pasture
field
belong
to
these
farm
look
half
starve
;
but
somehow
there
be
an
odd
,
intelligent
expression
in
their
face
,
as
well
as
in
those
of
the
black
-
visaged
sheep
,
which
be
seldom
see
in
the
placidly
stupid
countenance
of
well
-
feed
animal
.
<EOS>
all
the
fence
be
turf
bank
,
with
loose
stone
pile
into
wall
on
the
top
of
these
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
comparative
fertility
and
luxuriance
down
below
in
the
rare
green
dale
.
<EOS>
the
narrow
meadow
stretch
along
the
brookside
seem
as
though
the
cow
could
really
satisfy
their
hunger
in
the
deep
rich
grass
;
whereas
on
the
high
land
the
scanty
herbage
be
hardly
worth
the
fatigue
of
move
about
in
search
of
it
.
<EOS>
even
in
these
"
bottom
"
the
piping
sea
-
wind
,
follow
the
current
of
the
stream
,
stunted
and
cut
low
any
tree
;
but
still
there
be
rich
thick
underwood
,
tangle
and
tie
together
with
bramble
,
and
brier
-
rise
,
[
sic
]
and
honeysuckle
;
and
if
the
farmer
in
these
comparatively
happy
valley
have
have
wife
or
daughter
who
care
for
gardening
,
many
a
flower
would
have
grow
on
the
western
or
southern
side
of
the
rough
stone
house
.
<EOS>
but
at
that
time
gardening
be
not
a
popular
art
in
any
part
of
England
;
in
the
north
it
be
not
yet
.
<EOS>
nobleman
and
gentleman
may
have
beautiful
garden
;
but
farmer
and
day
-
labourer
care
little
for
them
north
of
the
Trent
,
which
be
all
I
can
answer
for
.
<EOS>
a
few
"
berry
"
bush
,
a
black
currant
tree
or
two
(
the
leave
to
be
use
in
heighten
the
flavour
of
tea
,
the
fruit
as
medicinal
for
cold
and
sore
throat
)
,
a
potato
ground
(
and
this
be
not
so
common
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
as
it
be
now
)
,
a
cabbage
bed
,
a
bush
of
sage
,
and
balm
,
and
thyme
,
and
marjoram
,
with
possibly
a
rose
tree
,
and
"
old
man
"
grow
in
the
midst
;
a
little
plot
of
small
strong
coarse
onion
,
and
perhaps
some
marigold
,
the
petal
of
which
flavour
the
salt
-
beef
broth
;
such
plant
make
up
a
well
-
furnish
garden
to
a
farmhouse
at
the
time
and
place
to
which
my
story
belong
.
<EOS>
but
for
twenty
mile
inland
there
be
no
forget
the
sea
,
nor
the
sea
-
trade
;
refuse
shell
-
fish
,
seaweed
,
the
offal
of
the
melting
-
house
,
be
the
staple
manure
of
the
district
;
great
ghastly
whale
-
jaw
,
bleach
bare
and
white
,
be
the
arch
over
the
gate
-
post
to
many
a
field
or
moorland
stretch
.
<EOS>
out
of
every
family
of
several
son
,
however
agricultural
their
position
may
be
,
one
have
go
to
sea
,
and
the
mother
look
wistfully
seaward
at
the
change
of
the
keen
pipe
moorland
wind
.
<EOS>
the
holiday
ramble
be
to
the
coast
;
no
one
care
to
go
inland
to
see
aught
,
unless
indeed
it
may
be
to
the
great
annual
horse
-
fair
hold
where
the
dreary
land
break
into
habitation
and
cultivation
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
in
this
country
sea
thought
follow
the
thinker
far
inland
;
whereas
in
most
other
part
of
the
island
,
at
five
mile
from
the
ocean
,
he
have
all
but
forget
the
existence
of
such
an
element
as
salt
water
.
<EOS>
the
great
Greenland
trade
of
the
coast
town
be
the
main
and
primary
cause
of
this
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
also
a
dread
and
an
irritation
in
every
one
's
mind
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
in
connection
with
the
neighbouring
sea
.
  
<EOS>
since
the
termination
of
the
american
war
,
there
have
be
nothing
to
call
for
any
unusual
energy
in
man
the
navy
;
and
the
grant
require
by
Government
for
this
purpose
diminish
with
every
year
of
peace
.
<EOS>
in
1792
this
grant
touch
its
minimum
for
many
year
.
<EOS>
in
1793
the
proceeding
of
the
French
have
set
Europe
on
fire
,
and
the
English
be
rage
with
anti
-
gallican
excitement
,
foment
into
action
by
every
expedient
of
the
Crown
and
its
Ministers
.
<EOS>
We
have
our
ship
;
but
where
be
our
man
?
<EOS>
the
Admiralty
have
,
however
,
a
ready
remedy
at
hand
,
with
ample
precedent
for
its
use
,
and
with
common
(
if
not
statute
)
law
to
sanction
its
application
.
<EOS>
They
issue
"
press
warrant
,
"
call
upon
the
civil
power
throughout
the
country
to
support
their
officer
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
.
<EOS>
the
sea
-
coast
be
divide
into
district
,
under
the
charge
of
a
captain
in
the
navy
,
who
again
delegate
sub
-
district
to
lieutenant
;
and
in
this
manner
all
homeward
-
bind
vessel
be
watch
and
wait
for
,
all
port
be
under
supervision
;
and
in
a
day
,
if
need
be
,
a
large
number
of
man
could
be
add
to
the
force
of
his
Majesty
's
navy
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
Admiralty
become
urgent
in
their
demand
,
they
be
also
willing
to
be
unscrupulous
.
<EOS>
landsman
,
if
able
-
bodied
,
may
soon
be
train
into
good
sailor
;
and
once
in
the
hold
of
the
tender
,
which
always
await
the
success
of
the
operation
of
the
press
-
gang
,
it
be
difficult
for
such
prisoner
to
bring
evidence
of
the
nature
of
their
former
occupation
,
especially
when
none
have
leisure
to
listen
to
such
evidence
,
or
be
willing
to
believe
it
if
they
do
listen
,
or
would
act
upon
it
for
the
release
of
the
captive
<EOS>
if
they
have
by
possibility
both
listen
and
believe
.
<EOS>
man
be
kidnap
,
literally
disappear
,
and
nothing
be
ever
hear
of
them
again
.
<EOS>
the
street
of
a
busy
town
be
not
safe
from
such
press
-
gang
capture
,
as
Lord
Thurlow
could
have
tell
,
after
a
certain
walk
he
take
about
this
time
on
Tower
Hill
,
when
he
,
the
attorney
-
general
of
England
,
be
impress
,
when
the
Admiralty
have
its
own
peculiar
way
of
get
rid
of
tiresome
besieger
and
petitioner
.
<EOS>
nor
yet
be
lonely
inland
dweller
more
secure
;
many
a
rustic
go
to
a
statute
fair
or
"
mop
,
"
and
never
come
home
to
tell
of
his
hiring
;
many
a
stout
young
farmer
vanish
from
his
place
by
the
hearth
of
his
father
,
and
be
no
more
hear
of
by
mother
or
lover
;
so
great
be
the
press
for
man
to
serve
in
the
navy
during
the
early
year
of
the
war
with
France
,
and
after
every
great
naval
victory
of
that
war
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
of
the
Admiralty
lie
in
wait
for
all
merchantman
and
trader
;
there
be
many
instance
of
vessel
return
home
after
long
absence
,
and
laden
with
rich
cargo
,
be
board
within
a
day
's
distance
of
land
,
and
so
many
man
press
and
carry
off
,
that
the
ship
,
with
her
cargo
,
become
unmanageable
from
the
loss
of
her
crew
,
drift
out
again
into
the
wild
wide
ocean
,
and
be
sometimes
find
in
the
helpless
guidance
of
one

<EOS>
now
all
this
tyranny
(
for
I
can
use
no

be
marvellous
to
us

we
can
not

even

<EOS>
when

take
these

we
do
not
wonder
at
Lord

complain

<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
live
in
close
neighbourhood
to
the
metropolis
 
<EOS>
the
centre
of
politic
and
news
 
inspire
the
inhabitant
of
the
southern
county
with
a
strong
feeling
of
that
kind
of
patriotism
which
consist
in
hate
all
other

or
whether
it
be
that
the
chance
of
capture
be
so
much
great
at
all
the
southern
port
that
the
merchant
sailor
become
inure
to
the
danger

or
whether
it
be
that
serve
in
the
navy
,
to
those
familiar
with
such
town
as
Portsmouth
and
Plymouth
,
have
an
attraction
to
most
man
from
the
dash
and
brilliancy
of
the
adventurous
employment
 
<EOS>
it
be
certain
that
the
southerner
take
the
oppression
of
press
-
warrant
more
submissively
than
the
wild
north
-
eastern
people
.
<EOS>
for
with
them
the
chance
of
profit
beyond
their
wage
in
the
whaling
or
Greenland
trade
extend
to
the
low
description
of
sailor
.
<EOS>
He
may
rise
by
dare
and
save
to
be
a
ship
-
owner
himself
.
<EOS>
number
around
him
have
do
so
;
and
this
very
fact
make
the
distinction
between
class
and
class
less
apparent
;
and
the
common
venture
and
danger
,
the
universal
interest
feel
in
one
pursuit
,
bind
the
inhabitant
of
that
line
of
coast
together
with
a
strong
tie
,
the
severance
of
which
by
any
violent
extraneous
measure
,
give
rise
to
passionate
anger
and
thirst
for
vengeance
.
<EOS>
a
Yorkshireman
once
say
to
me
,
"
My
county
folk
be
all
alike
.
<EOS>
Their
first
thought
be
how
to
resist
.
<EOS>
why
!
<EOS>
I
myself
,
if
I
hear
a
man
say
it
be
a
fine
day
,
catch
myself
try
to
find
out
that
it
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
in
thought
;
it
be
so
in
word
;
it
be
so
in
deed
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
you
may
imagine
the
press
-
gang
have
no
easy
time
of
it
on
the
Yorkshire
coast
.
<EOS>
in
other
place
they
inspire
fear
,
but
here
rage
and
hatred
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
Mayor
of
York
be
warn
on
20th
January
,
1777
,
by
an
anonymous
letter
,
that
'
if
those
man
be
not
send
from
the
city
on
or
before
the
follow
Tuesday
,
his
lordship
's
own
dwelling
,
and
the
Mansion
-
house
also
,
should
be
burn
to
the
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
something
of
the
ill
-
feeling
that
prevail
on
the
subject
be
owe
to
the
fact
which
I
have
notice
in
other
place
similarly
situate
.
<EOS>
where
the
landed
possession
of
gentleman
of
ancient
family
but
limited
income
surround
a
centre
of
any
kind
of
profitable
trade
or
manufacture
,
there
be
a
sort
of
latent
ill
-
will
on
the
part
of
the
squire
to
the
tradesman
,
<EOS>
be
he
manufacturer
,
merchant
,
or
ship
-
owner
,
in
whose
hand
be
hold
a
power
of
money
-
making
,
which
no
hereditary
pride
,
or
gentlemanly
love
of
do
nothing
,
prevent
him
from
use
.
<EOS>
this
ill
-
will
,
to
be
sure
,
be
mostly
of
a
negative
kind
;
its
most
common
form
of
manifestation
be
in
absence
of
speech
or
action
,
a
sort
of
torpid
and
genteel
ignore
all
unpleasant
neighbour
;
but
really
the
whale
-
fishery
of
Monkshaven
have
become
so
impertinently
and
obtrusively
prosperous
of
late
year
at
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
the
Monkshaven
ship
-
owner
be
grow
so
wealthy
and
consequential
,
that
the
squire
,
who
live
at
home
at
ease
in
the
old
stone
manor
-
house
scatter
up
and
down
the
surround
moorland
,
feel
that
the
check
upon
the
Monkshaven
trade
likely
to
be
inflict
by
the
press
-
gang
,
be
wisely
ordain
by
the
high
power
(
how
high
they
place
these
power
I
will
not
venture
to
say
)
,
to
prevent
overhaste
in
get
rich
,
which
be
a
scriptural
fault
,
and
they
also
think
that
they
be
only
do
their
duty
in
back
up
the
Admiralty
warrant
by
all
the
civil
power
at
their
disposal
,
whenever
they
be
call
upon
,
and
whenever
they
could
do
so
without
take
too
much
trouble
in
affair
which
do
not
after
all
much
concern
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
just
another
motive
in
the
mind
of
some
provident
parent
of
many
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
captain
and
lieutenant
employ
on
this
service
be
mostly
agreeable
bachelor
,
bring
up
to
a
genteel
profession
,
at
the
least
they
be
very
pleasant
visitor
,
when
they
have
a
day
to
spare
;
who
know
what
may
come
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
these
brave
officer
be
not
unpopular
in
Monkshaven
itself
,
except
at
the
time
when
they
be
bring
into
actual
collision
with
the
people
.
<EOS>
They
have
the
frank
manner
of
their
profession
;
they
be
know
to
have
serve
in
those
engagement
,
the
very
narrative
of
which
at
this
day
will
warm
the
heart
of
a
Quaker
,
and
they
themselves
do
not
come
prominently
forward
in
the
dirty
work
which
,
nevertheless
,
be
permit
and
quietly
sanction
by
them
.
<EOS>
so
while
few
Monkshaven
people
pass
the
low
public
-
house
over
which
the
navy
blue
-
flag
stream
,
as
a
sign
that
it
be
the
rendezvous
of
the
press
-
gang
,
without
spit
towards
it
in
sign
of
abhorrence
,
yet
,
perhaps
,
the
very
same
person
would
give
some
rough
token
of
respect
to
Lieutenant
Atkinson
if
they
meet
him
in
High
Street
.
<EOS>
touch
their
hat
be
an
unknown
gesture
in
those
part
,
but
they
would
move
their
head
in
a
droll
,
familiar
kind
of
way
,
neither
a
wag
nor
a
nod
,
but
mean
all
the
same
to
imply
friendly
regard
.
<EOS>
the
ship
-
owner
,
too
,
invite
him
to
an
occasional
dinner
or
supper
,
all
the
time
look
forward
to
the
chance
of
his
turn
out
an
active
enemy
,
and
not
by
any
mean
inclined
to
give
him
"
the
run
of
the
house
,
"
however
many
unmarried
daughter
may
grace
their
table
.
<EOS>
still
as
he
could
tell
a
rattle
story
,
drink
hard
,
and
be
seldom
too
busy
to
come
at
a
short
notice
,
he
get
on
better
than
any
one
could
have
expect
with
the
Monkshaven
folk
.
<EOS>
and
the
principal
share
of
the
odium
of
his
business
fall
on
his
subordinate

who
be
one
and
all
regard
in
the
light
of
mean
kidnapper

spy
 
"

as
the
common

esteem
them

and
as
such
they
be
ready
at
the
first
provocation
to
hunt

to
worry
them
,

little
care
the

this

<EOS>
whatever
else
they
be

they
be
brave

daring

<EOS>
They

lawful

They

They

there

It

HOME
from
GREENLAND
  
<EOS>
one
hot
day
,
early
in
October
of
the
year
1796
,
two
girl
set
off
from
their
country
home
to
Monkshaven
to
sell
their
butter
and
egg
,
for
they
be
both
farmer
'
daughter
,
though
rather
in
different
circumstance
;
for
Molly
Corney
be
one
of
a
large
family
of
child
,
and
have
to
rough
it
accordingly
;
Sylvia
Robson
be
an
only
child
,
and
be
much
make
of
in
more
people
's
estimation
than
Mary
's
by
her
elderly
parent
.
<EOS>
They
have
each
purchase
to
make
after
their
sale
be
effect
,
as
sale
of
butter
and
egg
be
effect
in
those
day
by
the
market
-
woman
sit
on
the
step
of
the
great
old
mutilated
cross
till
a
certain
hour
in
the
afternoon
,
after
which
,
if
all
their
good
be
not
dispose
of
,
they
take
them
unwillingly
to
the
shop
and
sell
them
at
a
low
price
.
<EOS>
but
good
housewife
do
not
despise
come
themselves
to
the
Butter
Cross
,
and
,
smell
and
depreciate
the
article
they
want
,
keep
up
a
perpetual
struggle
of
word
,
try
,
often
in
vain
,
to
beat
down
price
.
<EOS>
a
housekeeper
of
the
last
century
would
have
think
that
she
do
not
know
her
business
,
if
she
have
not
go
through
this
preliminary
process
;
and
the
farmer
'
wife
and
daughter
treat
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
,
reply
with
a
good
deal
of
independent
humour
to
the
customer
,
who
,
once
have
discover
where
good
butter
and
fresh
egg
be
to
be
sell
,
come
time
after
time
to
depreciate
the
article
she
always
end
in
take
.
<EOS>
there
be
leisure
for
all
this
kind
of
work
in
those
day
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
have
tie
a
knot
on
her
pink
-
spot
handkerchief
for
each
of
the
various
purchase
she
have
to
make
;
dull
but
important
article
need
for
the
week
's
consumption
at
home
;
if
she
forget
any
one
of
them
she
know
she
be
sure
of
a
good
"
rating
"
from
her
mother
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
them
make
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
look
like
one
of
the
nine
-
tail
of
a
"
cat
;
"
but
not
a
single
thing
be
for
herself
,
nor
,
indeed
,
for
any
one
individual
of
her
numerous
family
.
<EOS>
there
be
neither
much
thought
nor
much
money
to
spend
for
any
but
collective
want
in
the
Corney
family
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
different
with
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
choose
her
first
cloak
,
not
to
have
an
old
one
of
her
mother
's
,
that
have
go
down
through
two
sister
,
dye
for
the
fourth
time
(
and
Molly
would
have
be
glad
<EOS>
have
even
this
chance
be
hers
)
,
but
to
buy
a
bran
-
new
duffle
cloak
all
for
herself
,
with
not
even
an
eld
authority
to
curb
her
as
to
price
,
only
Molly
to
give
her
admire
counsel
,
and
as
much
sympathy
as
be
consistent
with
a
little
patient
envy
of
Sylvia
's
happy
circumstance
.
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
they
wander
off
from
the
one
grand
subject
of
thought
,
but
Sylvia
,
with
unconscious
art
,
soon
bring
the
conversation
round
to
the
fresh
consideration
of
the
respective
merit
of
gray
and
scarlet
.
<EOS>
these
girl
be
walk
bare
-
foot
and
carry
their
shoe
and
stocking
in
their
hand
during
the
first
part
of
their
way
;
but
as
they
be
draw
near
Monkshaven
they
stop
,
and
turn
aside
along
a
foot
-
path
that
lead
from
the
main
-
road
down
to
the
bank
of
the
Dee
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
stone
in
the
river
about
here
,
round
which
the
water
gather
and
eddy
and
form
deep
pool
.
<EOS>
molly
sate
down
on
the
grassy
bank
to
wash
her
foot
;
but
Sylvia
,
more
active
(
or
perhaps
light
-
hearted
with
the
notion
of
the
cloak
in
the
distance
)
,
place
her
basket
on
a
gravelly
bit
of
shore
,
and
,
give
a
long
spring
,
seat
herself
on
a
stone
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
then
she
begin
dip
her
little
rosy
toe
in
the
cool
rushing
water
and
whisk
them
out
with
childish
glee
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
quiet
,
wi

the

,
Sylvia
?
<EOS>
Thou'st
splash
me
all
ower
,
and
my
feyther'll
noane
be
so
keen
<EOS>
o
'
give
me
a
new
cloak
as
thine
be
,
seemingly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
quiet
,
not
to
say
penitent
,
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
draw
up
her
foot
instantly
;
and
,
as
if
to
take
herself
out
of
temptation
,
she
turn
away
from
Molly
to
that
side
of
her
stony
seat
on
which
the
current
run
shallow
,
and
break
by
pebble
.
<EOS>
but
once
disturb
in
her
play
,
her
thought
revert
to
the
great
subject
of
the
cloak
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
as
still
as
a
minute
before
she
have
be
full
of
frolic
and
gambol
life
.
<EOS>
She
have
tuck
herself
up
on
the
stone
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
cushion
,
and
she
a
little
sultana
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
be
deliberately
wash
her
foot
and
draw
on
her
stocking
,
when
she
hear

Sylvia

in
a
pathetic

funnily
childlike

<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
whether
molly
think
this
an
equal
division
.
  
<EOS>
each
girl
wear
tightly
-
fit
stocking
,
knit
by
her
own
hand
,
of
<EOS>
the
blue
worst
common
in
that
country
;
they
have
on
neat
high
-
heeled
black
leather
shoe
,
come
well
over
the
instep
,
and
fasten
as
well
as
ornament
with
bright
steel
buckle
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
walk
so
lightly
and
freely
now
as
they
do
before
they
be
shod
,
but
their
step
be
still
springy
with
the
buoyancy
of
early
youth
;
for
neither
of
them
be
twenty
,
indeed
I
believe
Sylvia
be
not
more
than
seventeen
at
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
clamber
up
the
steep
grassy
path
,
with
bramble
catch
at
their
kilte
petticoat
,
through
the
copse
-
wood
,
till
they
regain
the
high
road
;
and
then
they
"
settle
themselves
,
"
as
they
call
it
<EOS>
;
that
be
to
say
,
they
take
off
their
black
feel
hat
,
and
tie
up
their
clustering
hair
afresh
;
they
shake
off
every
speck
of
wayside
dust
;
straighten
the
little
shawl
(
or
large
neck
-
kerchief
,
call
them
which
you
will
)
that
be
spread
over
their
shoulder
,
pin
below
the
throat
,
and
confine
at
the
waist
by
their
apron
-
string
;
and
then
put
on
their
hat
again
,
and
pick
up
their
basket
,
they
prepare
to
walk
decorously
into
the
town
of
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
turn
of
the
road
show
them
the
red
peaked
roof
of
the
closely
packed
house
lie
almost
directly
below
the
hill
on
which
they
be
.
<EOS>
the
full
autumn
sun
bring
out
the
ruddy
colour
of
the
tile
gable
,
and
deepen
the
shadow
in
the
narrow
street
.
<EOS>
the
narrow
harbour
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
be
crowd
with
small
vessel
of
all
description
,
make
an
intricate
forest
of
mast
.
<EOS>
beyond
lie
the
sea
,
like
a
flat
pavement
of
sapphire
,
scarcely
a
ripple
vary
its
sunny
surface
<EOS>
,
that
stretch
out
league
away
till
it
blend
with
the
softened
azure
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
on
this
blue
trackless
water
float
score
of
white
-
sail
fishing
boat
,
apparently
motionless
,
unless
you
measure
their
progress
by
some
land
-
mark
;
but
still
,
and
silent
,
and
distant
as
they
seem
,
the
consciousness
that
there
be
man
on

,
each
go
forth
into
the
great
deep
,
add
unspeakably
to
the
interest
feel
in
watch
them

<EOS>
close
to
the
bar
of
the
river
Dee
a
large
vessel
lie
to

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
who
have
only
recently
come
into
the
neighbourhood
,
look
at
this
with
the
same
quiet
interest
as
she
do
at
all
the
other
;
but
Molly
,
as
soon
as
her
eye
catch
the
build
of
it
,
cry
out
aloud
    
<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
and
she
turn
round
and
shake
both
Sylvia
's
hand
in
the
fulness
of
her
excitement
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
colour
rise
,
and
her
eye
sparkle
out
of
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
ta
sure
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
breathless
in
her
turn
;
for
though
she
do
not
know
by
the
aspect
of
the
different
ship
on
what
trade
they
be
bind
,
yet
she
be
well
aware
of
the
paramount
interest
attach
to
whale

<EOS>
"
three
o'clock

<EOS>
and
it

Molly

<EOS>
"
if

<EOS>
be
sharp

"
  
<EOS>
and
down
the
steep
long
hill
they
go
at
a
pace
that
be
almost
a
run
.
<EOS>
a
run
they
dare
not
make
it
;
and
as
it
be
,
the
rate
at
which
they
walk
would
have
cause
destruction
among
egg
less
carefully
pack
.
<EOS>
when
the
descent
be
end
,
there
be
yet
the
long
narrow
street
before
them
,
bend
and
swerve
from
the
straight
line
,
as
it
follow
the
course
of
the

<EOS>
the

feel
as

He

of

then

she

<EOS>
Molly

Sylvia
have
leave
the

hushed

<EOS>
but
fifty
yard
along
the

they
pass
five

six
girl

flushed

careless

who

from

as
from

they
could
command
the

<EOS>
They
be
wild
and
free
in
their
gesture

and
hold
each
other
by
the
hand

and
sway
from

<EOS>
old

stand
about

their

the
adventure
they
could
no

but
quite
unable
to
keep
up
any
semblance

on
indifferent
subject

<EOS>
the
town
seem
very
quiet
and
desert
as
Molly

enter
the
dark
,
irregular
Bridge

,
and
the

place
be
as
empty

<EOS>
She

go
to

<EOS>
the

have
his

at

"

<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
now
,
there
be
some
un
in
yon
ship
that
'
ud
give
as
much
as
a
shill
a
pound
for
this
butter
if
he
only
know
who
churn
it
!
"
<EOS>
this
be
to
Sylvia
,
as
he
hand
her
back
her
property
.
  
<EOS>
the
fancy
-
free
Sylvia
redden
,
pout
,
toss
back
her
head
,
and
hardly
deign
a
farewell
word
of
thank
or
civility
to
the
lame
man
;
she
be
at
an
age
to
be
affront
by
any
joke
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
Molly
take
the
joke
without
disclaimer
and
without
offence
.
<EOS>
She
rather
like
the
unfounded
idea
of
her
have
a
sweetheart
,
and
be
rather
surprised
to
think
how
devoid
of
foundation
the
notion
be
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
have
a
new
cloak
as
Sylvia
be
go
to
have
,
then
,
indeed
,
there
may
be
a
chance
!
<EOS>
until
some
such
good
luck
,
it
be
as
well
to
laugh
and
blush
as
if
the
surmise
of
her
have
a
lover
be
not
very
far
from
the
truth
,
and
so
she
reply
in
something
of
the
same
strain
as
the
lame
net
-
maker
to
his
joke
about
the
butter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
need
it
all
,
and
more
too

to
grease
his
tongue

if
iver
he
reckon
to
win
me
for
his
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
out
of
the
shop
,
Sylvia
say
,
in
a
coax
tone
,
    
"
Molly
,
who
be
it
?
<EOS>
whose
tongue
will
need
grease
?
<EOS>
just
tell
me
,
and
I
will
never
tell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
much
in
earnest
that
Molly
be
perplex
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
quite
like
say
that
she
have
allude
to
no
one
in
particular
,
only
to
a
possible
sweetheart
,
so
she
begin
to
think
what
young
man
have
make
the
most
civil
speech
to
her
in
her
life
;
the
list
be
not
a
long
one
to
go
over
,
for
her
father
be
not
so
well
off
as
to
make
her
seek
after
for
her
money
,
and
her
face
be
rather
of
the
homely
.
<EOS>
but
she
suddenly
remember
her
cousin
,
the
specksioneer
,
who
have
give
her
two
large
shell
,
and
take
a
kiss
from
her
half
-
willing
lip
before
he
go
to
sea
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
so
she
smile
a
little
,
and
then
say
,
    
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
dunno
.
<EOS>
It
be
ill
talk

o

hissen

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
Charley

<EOS>
who

<EOS>
ask
Sylvia
,
in
a
low
,
tender
tone

as

touch
on
a
great
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
only
say
,
"
be
quiet

yo

,
"
and
Sylvia
could
not
make
out
whether
she
cut
the
conversation
so
short
because
she
be
offend
,
or
because
they
have
come
to
the
shop
where
they
have
to
sell
their
butter
and
egg
.
  
<EOS>
"
now

"

with

<EOS>
"

for
I

o'clock

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
hang
her
head
and
look
very
demure
as
she
walk
off
by
herself
to
Foster
's
shop
in
the
market
-
place
.
    
<EOS>
buy
a
new
CLOAK
  
<EOS>
Foster
's
shop
be
the
shop
of
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
It
be
keep
by
two
Quaker
brother
,
who
be
now
old
man
;
and
their
father
have
keep
it
before
them
;
probably
his
father
before
that
.
<EOS>
People
remember
it
as
an
old
-
fashioned
dwelling
-
house
,
with
a
sort
of
supplementary
shop
with
unglazed
window
project
from
the
low
story
.
<EOS>
these
opening
have
long
be
fill
with
pane
of
glass
that
at
the
present
day
would
be
account
very
small
,
but
which
seventy
year
ago
be
much
admire
for
their
size
.
<EOS>
I
can
best
make
you
understand
the
appearance
of
the
place
by
bid
you
think
of
the
long
opening
in
a
butcher
's
shop
,
and
then
to
fill
them
up
in
your
imagination
with
pane
about
eight
inch
by
six
,
in
a
heavy
wooden
frame
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
of
these
window
on
each
side
the
door
-
place
,
which
be
keep
partially
close
through
the
day
by
a
low
gate
about
a
yard
high
.
<EOS>
half
the
shop
be
appropriate
to
grocery
;
the
other
half
to
drapery
,
and
a
little
mercery
.
<EOS>
the
good
old
brother
give
all
their
know
customer
a
kindly
welcome
;
shake
hand
with
many
of
them
,
and
ask
all
after
their
family
and
domestic
circumstance
before
proceed
to
business
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
for
the
world
have
have
any
sign
of
festivity
at
Christmas
,
and
scrupulously
keep
their
shop
open
at
that
holy
festival
,
ready
themselves
to
serve
sooner
than
tax
the
conscience
of
any
of
their
assistant
,
only
nobody
ever
come
.
<EOS>
but
on
New
Year
's
Day
they
have
a
great
cake

ready
in
the
parlour
behind
the
shop

of
which
all
who
come
in
to
buy
anything
be
ask
to
partake
.
<EOS>
yet
,
though
scrupulous
in
most
thing
,
it
do
not
go
against
the
conscience
of
these
good
brother
to
purchase
smuggle
article
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
back
way
from
the
river

side
,
up
a
cover
entry
,
to
the
yard
-
door
of
the
Fosters
,
and
a
peculiar
kind
of
knock
at
this
door
always
bring
out
either
John
or
Jeremiah
,
or
if
not
them
,
their
shopman
,
Philip
Hepburn
;
and
the
same
cake
and
wine
that
the
excise
officer
's
wife
may
just
have
be
taste
,
be
bring
out
in
the
back
parlour
to
treat
the
smuggler
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
locking
of
door
,
and
drawing
of
the
green
silk
curtain
that
be
suppose
to
shut
out
the
shop
,
but
really
all
this
be
do
very
much
for
form
's
sake
.
<EOS>
everybody
in
Monkshaven
smuggle
who
could
,
and
every
one
wear
smuggle
good
who
could
,
and
great
reliance
be
place
on
the
excise
officer
's
neighbourly
feeling

<EOS>
the
story
go
that
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
be
so
rich
that
they
could
buy
up
all
the
new
town
across
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
They
have
certainly
begin
to
have
a
kind
of
primitive
bank
in
connection
with
their
shop
,
receive
and
take
care
of
such
money
as
people
do
not
wish
to
retain
in
their
house
for
fear
of
burglar
.
<EOS>
no
one
ask
them
for
interest
on
the
money
thus
deposit
,
nor
do
they
give
any
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
any
of
their
customer
,
on
whose
character
they
could
depend
,
want
a
little
advance
,
the
foster
,
after
due
inquiry
make
,
and
in
some
case
due
security
give
,
be
not
unwilling
to
lend
a
moderate
sum
without
charge
a
penny
for
the
use
of
their
money
.
<EOS>
all
the
article
they
sell
be
as
good
as
they
know
how
to
choose
,
and
for
them
they
expect
and
obtain
ready
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
they
only
keep
on
the
shop
for
their
amusement
.
<EOS>
other
aver
that
there
be
some
plan
of
a
marriage
run
in
the
brother
'
head
 
a
marriage
between
William
Coulson
,
Mr.
Jeremiah
's
wife
's
nephew
(
Mr.
Jeremiah
be
a
widower
)
,
and
Hester
Rose
,
whose
mother
be
some
kind
of
distant
relation
,
and
who
serve
in
the
shop
along
with
William
Coulson
and
Philip
Hepburn
.
<EOS>
again
,
this
be
deny
by
those
who
aver
that
Coulson
be
no
blood
relation
,
and
that
if
the
Fosters
have
intend
to
do
anything
considerable
for
Hester
,
they
would
never
have
allow
her
and
her
mother
to
live
in
such
a
spare
way
,
ekee
out
their
small
income
by
have
Coulson
and
Hepburn
for
lodger
.
<EOS>
no
;
John
and
Jeremiah
would
leave
all
their
money
to
some
hospital
or
to
some
charitable
institution
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
there
be
a
reply
to
this
;
when
be
there
not
many
side
to
an
argument
about
a
possibility
concern
which
no
fact
be
know
?
<EOS>
part
of
the
reply
turn
on
this
:
the
old
gentleman
have
,
probably
,
some
deep
plan
in
their
head
in
permit
their
cousin
to
take
Coulson
and
Hepburn
as
lodger
,
the
one
a
kind
of
nephew
,
the
other
,
though
so
young
,
the
head
man
in
the
shop
;
if
either
of
them
take
a
fancy
to
Hester
,
how
agreeably
matter
could
be
arrange
!
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
Hester
be
patiently
wait
to
serve
Sylvia
,
who
be
stand
before
her
<EOS>
a
little
shy
,
a
little
perplex
and
distract
,
by
the
sight
of
so
many
pretty
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
be
a
tall
young
woman
,
sparely
yet
largely
form
,
of
a
grave
aspect
,
which
make
her
look
old
than
she
really
be
.
<EOS>
Her
thick
brown
hair
be
smoothly
take
off
her
broad
forehead
,
and
put
in
a
very
orderly
fashion
,
under
her
linen
cap
;
her
face
be
a
little
square
,
and
her
complexion
sallow
,
though
the
texture
of
her
skin
be
fine
.
<EOS>
Her
gray
eye
be
very
pleasant
,
because
they
look
at
you
so
honestly
and
kindly
;
her
mouth
be
slightly
compress
,
as
most
have
it
who
be
in
the
habit
of
restrain
their
feeling
;
but
when
she
speak
you
do
not
perceive
this
,
and
her
rare
smile
slowly
break
forth
show
her
white
even
tooth
,
and
when
accompany
,
as
it
generally
be
,
by
a
sudden
uplifting
of
her
soft
eye
,
it
make
her
countenance
very
win
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
stuff
of
sober
colour
,
both
in
accordance
with
her
own
taste
,
and
in
unasked
compliance
with
the
religious
custom
of
the
foster
;
but
Hester
herself
be
not
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
stand
opposite
,
not
look
at
Hester
,
but
gaze
at
the
ribbon
in
the
shop
window
,
as
if
hardly
conscious
that
any
one
await
the
expression
of
her
wish
,
be
a
great
contrast
;
ready
to
smile
or
to
pout
,
or
to
show
her
feeling
in
any
way
,
with
a
character
as
undeveloped
as
a
child
's
,
affectionate
,
wilful
,
naughty
,
tiresome
,
charming
,
anything
,
in
fact
,
at
present
that
the
chance
of
an
hour
call
out
.
<EOS>
Hester
think
her
customer
the
pretty
creature
ever
see
,
in
the
moment
she
have
for
admiration
before
Sylvia
turn
round
and
,
recall
to
herself
,
begin
,
    
"
oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
miss
;
I
be
think
what
may
the
price
of
yon
crimson
ribbon
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
say
nothing
,
but
go
to
examine
the
shop
-
mark
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
I
want

I
only
want
some
stuff

a
cloak
.
<EOS>
thank
you
,
miss

but
I
be
very
sorry
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
silently
replace
the
ribbon
and
go
in
search
of
the
duffle
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
go
Sylvia
be
address
by
the
very
person
she
most
wish
to
avoid
,
and
whose
absence
she
have
rejoice
over
on
first
enter
the
shop
,
her
cousin
Philip
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
He

young
man
,
tall
,
but
with
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulder
,
bring
on
by
his
occupation
.
<EOS>
He
have
thick
hair
stand
off
from
his
forehead
in
a
peculiar
but
not
unplease
manner
;
a
long
face
,
with
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
,
dark
eye
,
and
a
long
upper
lip
,
which
give
a
disagreeable
aspect
to
a
face
that
may
otherwise
have
be
good
-
looking
.
  
<EOS>
"
good

Sylvie

"
he
say
;
"
what

<EOS>
how

<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
purse
up
her
red
lip
,
and
do
not
look
at
him
as
she
reply
,
  
<EOS>
"
I

and
so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turn
a
little
away
from
him
when
she
have
end
this
sentence
,
as
if
it
have
comprise
all
she
could
possibly
have
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
exclaim
,
  
"
You
will
not
know
how
to
choose
,
"
and
,
seat
himself
on
the
counter
,
he
swing
himself
over
after
the
fashion
of
shop
-
man
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
take
no
notice
of
him
,
but
pretend
to
be
count
over
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
,
Sylvie
?
"
<EOS>
ask
he
,
at
last
annoyed
at
her
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to

Sylvie
;
"
my
name

Sylvia
;
and
I
be
want
duffle
for

"
  
<EOS>
Hester
now
return
,
with
a
shop
-
boy
help
her
to
drag
along
the
great
roll
of
scarlet
and
gray
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
say
Philip
,
kick
the
red
duffle
with
his
foot
,
and
speak
to
the
lad
.
<EOS>
"
It

"
<EOS>
He
use
the
name
he
have
have
the
cousin
's
right
to
call
her
by
since
her
childhood
,
without
remember
her
word
on
the
subject
not
five
minute
before
;
but
she
do
,
and
be
vex
.
  
<EOS>
"
please

miss
,
it
be
the
scarlet
duffle
I
want

do
not
let
him
take
it

"
  
<EOS>
Hester
look
up
at
both
their
countenance
,
a
little
wonder
what
be
their
position
with
regard
to
each
other
;
for
this
,
then
,
be
the
beautiful
little
cousin
about
whom
Philip
have
talk
to
her
mother
,
as
sadly
spoilt
,
and
shamefully
ignorant
;
a
lovely
little
dunce
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Hester
have
picture
Sylvia
Robson
,
somehow
,
as
very
different
from
what
she
be
:
<EOS>
young
,
more
stupid
,
not
half
so
bright
and
charming
(
for
,
though
she
be
now
both
pouting
and
cross
,
it
be
evident
that
this
be
not
her
accustomed
mood
)
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
devote
her
attention
to
the
red
cloth
,
push
aside
the
gray
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
Hepburn
be
vex
at
his
advice
be
slight
;
and
yet
he
urge
it
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
respectable
,
quiet
-
look
article
that
will
go
well
with
any
colour
;
you
niver
will
be
so
foolish
as
to
take
what
will
mark
with
every
drop
of
rain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
sell
such
good
-
for
-
nothing
thing
,
"
reply
Sylvia
,
conscious
of
her
advantage
,
and
relax
a
little
(
as
little
as
she
possibly
could
)
of
her
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
come
in
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
mean
to
say
that
this
cloth
will
lose
its
first
brightness
in
wet
or
damp
;
but
it
will
always
be
a
good
article
,
and
the
colour
will
stand
a
deal
of
wear
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Foster
would
not
have
have
it
in
his
shop
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
do
not
like
that
even
a
reasonable
peace

make
interpreter
should
come
between
him
and
Sylvia
,
so
he
hold
his
tongue
in
indignant
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
go
on
:
  
"
to
be
sure
,
this
gray

the
close
make
,

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
mother
tell
me
eight
,
"
say
Sylvia
,
secretly
conscious
that
her
mother
would
have
prefer
the
more
sober
colour
;
and
feel
that
as
she
have
have
her
own
way
in
that
respect

she
be
bind
to
keep
to
the
direction

<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
she
would
not
have
yield
to
Philip
in
anything
that
she
could
help
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sound
of
child

foot
run
up
the
street
from
the
river

side
,
shout
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
at
the
noise
,
Sylvia
forget
her
cloak
and
her
little
spirit
of
vexation

door
of
the

<EOS>
Philip

because

<EOS>
Hester
look

with
passive

kindly
interest

as
soon
as
she
have
complete
her
duty
of

<EOS>
one
of
those
girl
whom
Sylvia
have
see
as
she

Molly
leave
the
crowd
on

quickly
up

<EOS>
Her
face

which
be
handsome
enough
as

be
whiten
with
excess
of
passionate
emotion

her
dress
untidy
and
flying

her
movement
heavy

free

<EOS>
She
belong
to
the
low

<EOS>
as
she
come
near

Sylvia

that
the
tear

down
her

quite
unconsciously
to

<EOS>
She
recognize
Sylvia

full
of

those

Nicholas

have
hurry
off

Philip

arrange

with

Mr.

knock
at

with
old

<EOS>
and
then
go
to
a
corner
cupboard

high
up

the
wall

he
pull
a
key
out
of
his
pocket

unlock
his
little
store
of
wine

cake

spirit

insist

should
eat

drink

take
some
last

Sylvia
decline
everything

with
less
courtesy
than
she
ought
to
have
show
to
the
offer
of
the
hospitable
old
man
.
<EOS>
Molly
take
wine
and
cake
,
leave
a
good
half
of
both
,
accord
to
the
code
of
manner
in
that
part
of
the
country
;
and
also
because
Sylvia
be
continually
urge
her
to
make
haste
.
<EOS>
for
the
latter
dislike
the
idea
of
her
cousin

esteem
it
necessary
to
accompany
them
home

and
want
to
escape
from
him
by
set
off
before

return

<EOS>
but
any
such
plan
be
frustrate
by
Philip

come
back
into

full
of
grave
content

which
brim
over
from
his
eye

with
the
parcel

obnoxious

duffle
under

anticipate
so
keenly

await
him
in

he
be
almost
surprised
by
the
gravity

his

they
prepare
for
it

<EOS>
Sylvia
be
a
little
penitent
for
her
rejection

Mr.

hospitality

now
she
find
out
how
unavaile
for
its
purpose
such
rejection
have
be

and
try
to
make
up
by
a
modest
sweetness
of
farewell
,
which
quite
win
his
heart

and
make
him
praise
her
up
to
Hester
in
a
way
to
which
she
,
observant
of
all

could
not
bring
herself
fully

what

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
It

,
though
they

<EOS>
It
be

fair
to
cotch

up

put

in
a
stifle
hole

all

with

for

they

out

send

off

again
it

no

<EOS>
four
o

them
be
rightly
match
wi

us

and
if
we
go
an

<EOS>
it

where

<EOS>
Philip

take

a
chance
he
seldom
have
with
Daniel

unless
the

have
his
pipe
between

<EOS>
so
after

have
fill
it

use
Sylvia

to
ram
down

a
habit
of
his
to
which
she

accustomed

she
lay
her

as
naturally
as
she
would
have
fetch
him
his

Philip
arrange
his

begin
    
"
I

I

make

<EOS>
Philip
,
who
sometimes
pursue
an
argument
longer
than
be
politic
for
himself
,
especially
when
he
feel
sure
of
be
on
the
conquering
side
,
do
not
see
that
Daniel
Robson
be
pass
out
of
the
indifference
of
conscious
wisdom
into
that
state
of
anger
which
ensue
when
a
question
become
personal
in
some
unspoken
way
.
<EOS>
Robson
have
contest
this
subject
once
or
twice
before
,
and
have
the
remembrance
of
former
dispute
to
add
to
his
present
vehemence
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
well
for
the
harmony
of
the
evening
that
Bell
and
Sylvia
return
from
the
kitchen
to
sit
in
the
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
to
wash
up
the
pan
and
basin
use
for
supper
;
Sylvia
have
privately
show
off
her
cloak
,
and
get
over
her
mother
's
shake
of
the
head
at
its
colour
with
a
coax
kiss
,
at
the
end
of
which
her
mother
have
adjust
her
cap
with
a
"
there

<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
ha
'
do
wi
'
thee
,
"
but
have
no
more
heart
to
show
her
disapprobation
;
and
now
they
come
back
to
their
usual
occupation
until
it
should
please
their
visitor
to
go
;
then
they
would
rake
the
fire
and
be
off
to
bed
;
for
neither
Sylvia
's
spinning
nor
Bell
's
knitting
be
worth
candle

light
,
and
morning
hour
be
precious
in
a
dairy
.
  
<EOS>
People
speak
of
the
way
in
which
harp

playing
set
off
a
graceful
figure
;
spinning
be
almost
as
become
an
employment
.
<EOS>
a
woman
stand
at
the
great
wool

wheel
,
one
arm
extend
,
the
other
hold
the
thread
,
her
head
throw
back
to
take
in
all
the
scope
of
her
occupation
;
or
if
it
be
the
less
spinning

wheel
for
flax
 
and
it
be
this
that
Sylvia
move
forwards
to
-
night
 
the
pretty
sound
of
the
buzzing
,
whir
motion
,
the
attitude
of
the
spinner
,
foot
and
hand
alike
engage
in
the
business
 
<EOS>
the
bunch
of
gay
coloured
ribbon
that
tie
the
bundle
of
flax
on
the
rock
 
all
make
it
into
a
picturesque
piece
of
domestic
business
that
may
rival
harp

play
any
day
for
the
amount
of
softness
and
grace
which
it
call
out
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
cheek
be
rather
flush
by
the
warmth
of
the
room
after
the
frosty
air

<EOS>
the
blue
ribbon
with
which
she
have
think
it
necessary
to
tie
back
her
hair
before
put
on
her
hat
to
go
to
market
have
get
rather
loose
,
and
allow
her
disarranged
curl
to
stray
in
a
manner
which
would
have
annoy
her
extremely
,
if
she
have
be
upstairs
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
;
but
although
they
be
not
set
in
the
exact
fashion
which
Sylvia
esteem
as
correct
,
they
look
very
pretty
and
luxuriant
.
<EOS>
Her
little
foot

place
on
the

traddle
"
,
be
still
encase
in
its
smartly
buckle
shoe
 
not
slightly
to
her
discomfort
,
as
she
be
unaccustomed
to
be
shod
in
walk
far
;
only
as
Philip
have
accompany
them
home
,
neither
she
nor
Molly
have
like
to
go
barefoot
.
<EOS>
Her
round
mottled
arm
and
ruddy
taper
hand
draw
out
the
flax
with
nimble
,
agile
motion
,
keep
time
to
the
movement
of
the
wheel

<EOS>
all
this
Philip
could
see
;
the
great
part
of
her
face
be
lose
to
him
as
she
half
avert
it
,
with
a
shy
dislike
to
the
way
in
which
she
know
from
past
experience
that
cousin
Philip
always
stare
at
her
.
<EOS>
and
avert
it
as
she
would
she
hear
with
silent
petulance
the
harsh
screech
of
Philip
's
chair
as
he
heavily
drag
it
on
the
stone
floor
,
sit
on
it
all
the
while
,
and
feel
that
he
be
move
round
so
as
to
look
at
her
as
much
as
be
in
his
power
,
without
absolutely
turn
his
back
on
either
her
father
or
mother

<EOS>
She
get
herself
ready
for
the
first
opportunity
of
contradiction

I

be

<EOS>
Bell
be
a
touch
better
educate
than
her
husband
,
but
he
do
not
acknowledge
this
,
and
make
a
particular
point
of
differ
from
her
whenever
she
use
a
word
beyond
his

She
be

she

<EOS>
Thou

<EOS>
Bell
do
think
of
that
often
;
oftener
than
her
husband

perhaps
,
for
she
remember
every

,
and
many
time
a

,
the
little
one
that
have
be
bear
and
have
die

it
be
not

<EOS>
Sylvia

who
have
more
insight
into
her

heart

Daniel

break
in

a
new
subject

oh
!
<EOS>
as
for

he

preach
up

all

I
say
naught
,

let
Molly
hold
her
own
;

I
could

a
tale
about
silk
an

<EOS>
Philip
's
face
flush

<EOS>
not
because
of
the
smuggling
;
every
one
do
that
,
only
it
be
consider
polite
to
ignore
it
;
but
he
be
annoy
to
perceive
how
quickly
his
little
cousin
have
discover
that
his
practice
do
not
agree
with
his
preaching
,
and
vex
,
too
,
to
see
how
delighted
she
be
to
bring
out
the
fact
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
little
idea
,
too
,
that
his
uncle
may
make
use
of
his
practice
as
an
argument
against
the
preaching
he
have
lately
be
indulge
in
,
in
opposition
to
Daniel
;
but
Daniel
be
too
far
go
in
his
holland
-
and
-
water
to
do
more
than
enunciate
his
own
opinion
,
which
he
do
with
hesitating
and
labour
distinctness
in
the
follow
sentence
:
  
<EOS>
"
what
I

Sylvia

too

be
in
no

not
only
with
her

with
every

her
cousin
Philip
,
be
it
a

of

to
drink
till
their

confused

<EOS>
so
she
simply
put
her

aside

clutch
at

bottle
of
spirit
,
but
perhaps
rather
more
good

humoured
with
what
he
have
drunk
than
he
be
before

he
jerk
a
little
more
into
his

before
his

carry
it
off
,
and
lock
it
up
in
the

put
the

at

He
have
to

out
the

set
out
on
his

think
,
it
must
be
confess

far
more
of
the

of

shake

at
such

the

say
Daniel

in
soliloquy
,
and
under

<EOS>
Sylvia
stand
,
poise
her
iron
,
and
listen
eagerly
,
afraid
to
give
Donkin
the
hot
iron
for
fear
of
interrupt
the
narrative
,
unwilling
to
put
it
into

because
that

would
perchance
remind

of
his

which
now
the

have
forget
,
<EOS>
so
eager
be
he
in
tell
his

.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
they
coome
on
over
t
'

wi
'
great
bound
,
and
<EOS>
up
t

side
they
coome
like
locust
,
all
armed

;
an
'
t
'
captain
say
he
see
Kinraid
hide
away
his
whale
knife
under
some
tarpaulin
'
,
and
he
know
he
mean
mischief
,
an
'
he
would
no
more
ha
'
stop
him
wi
'
a
word
nor
he
would
ha
'
stop
him
<EOS>
fra
'
kill

<EOS>
and
when
t
'
_
Aurora
_
's
man
be
aboard
,
one
on
'em
run
to
t
'
helm
;
and
at
that
t
'
captain
say
,
he
feel
as
if
his
wife
be
kiss
afore
his
face
;
but
say
he
,
"
I
bethink
me
on
t
'
man
as
be
shut
up
below

,
an
'
I
remember
t

folk
at
Monkshaven
as
be
look
out
for
us
even
then
;
an
'
I
say
to
mysel
'
,
I
would
speak
fair
as
long
as
I
could
,
more
by
token
o

the
whaling

knife
,
as
I
could
see
glint
bright
under

<EOS>
so
he
speak
quite
fair
and
civil
,
though
he
see'd
they
be
near
t
'
_
Aurora
_
,
and
t
'
<EOS>
_
Aurora
_
be
near
them
.
<EOS>
then
t
'
navy
captain
hail
him
thro
'
t
'
trumpet
,
wi
'
a
great
rough
blast
,
and
,
say
he
,
"
order
your

to
come
on

.
"
<EOS>
and
t
'
captain
of
t
'
whaler
say
his
man
cry
up
from
under
t
'
hatch
as
they
would
niver
be
gi'en
up
wi'out
bloodshed
,
and
<EOS>
he
see
Kinraid
take
out
his
pistol
,
and
look
well
to
t
'
priming
;
so
he
say
to
t
'
navy
captain
,
"
We
be
protect
Greenland
-
man
,
and
you
have
no
right
t
'
meddle
wi

us

"
<EOS>
but
t
'
navy
captain
only
bellow
t
'
more
,
"
order
<EOS>
your

t
'
come
on

.
<EOS>
if
they
will
not
obey
you
,
and
you
have
lose
the
command
of
your
vessel
<EOS>
,
I
reckon
you
be
in
a
state
of
mutiny
,
and
you
may
come
aboard
t
'
_
Aurora
_
and
such
man
as
be
willing
t
'
follow
you
,
and
I
will
fire
int
'
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
'
see
,
that
be
t
<EOS>
'
depth
o
'
<EOS>
the
man
:
he
be
for
pretend
and
pretexting
as
t
'
captain
could
na
manage
his
own
ship
,
and
as
he
would
help
him
.
<EOS>
but
our
Greenland
captain
be
noane
so
poor
-
spirited
,
and
say
he
,
"
She
be
full
of
oil
,
and
I
ware
you
of

if

(
for

stick
in

tell
me
,
but
whether
he

out
so
bold
at

I'se
not

they

only

bethink
her
with
a
blush
of
Molly

implication
that
he
be
more
than
a

immediately
long
to
go
off

see
Molly

and
hear
all
the
little
detail
which

not

it

<EOS>
from
that

Sylvia

be
bent
on

it
be
not
one
to
be
openly
avow
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
only
want
sadly
to
see
Molly
,
and
she
almost
believe
herself
that
it
be
to
consult
her
about
the
fashion
of
her
cloak
;
which
Donkin
be
to
cut
out
,
and
which
she
be
to
make
under
his
direction

at
any

this
be
the
reason
she
give
to
her

when
the

the

Moss
Brow

a

comfortless
place

<EOS>
You
have
to
cross
a

farmyard
,
all
puddle

,
on

stone

to
get
to
the

<EOS>
that

room
itself
be
sure
to
have
clothe
hang
to
dry
at

whatever
day
of

it

some

a

and
sometimes
these
article
lie
in

in

a

half

still
,
in

disorder
like
this

there
be
a
well

to

;
the
Corneys
be
rich
in

,
in
flock
and

as
well

and
to
them
neither

from
ill

They
be

Mrs.

the

as

the
condition
in
which
it
be
keep

have
pass
through
the
little

into
the
orchard

<EOS>
It
be
full
of
old
gnarl
apple

tree
,
their
trunk
cover
with
gray
lichen

in
which
the
cunning
chaffinch
build
her
nest
in

<EOS>
the
canker
branch
remain
on

tree

add
to
the
knot
interweaving
overhead

the
grass
grow
in
long
tuft

be
wet
and
tangle
under

<EOS>
there
be
a
tolerable
crop
of
rosy
apple
still
hang
on
the
gray
old
tree
,
and
here
and
there
they
show
ruddy
in
the
green
boss
of
untrimmed
grass
.
<EOS>
why
the
fruit
be
not
gather
,
as
it
be
evidently
ripe
,
would
have
puzzle
any
one
not
acquaint
with
the
Corney
family
to
say
;
but
to
them
it
be
always
a
maxim
in
practice
,
if
not
in
precept
,
"
do
nothing
to

day
that
you
can
put
off
till
to

accordingly
the
apple
drop
from
the
tree
at
any
little
gust
of

,
after

<EOS>
Sylvia
hasten
home
,
feel
as
if
she
have
be
absent
long
;
her
mother
stand
on
the
little
knoll
at
the
side
of
the
house
watch
for
her
,
with
her
hand
shade
her
eye
from
the
low
ray
of
the
set
sun
:
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
she
see
her
daughter
in
the
distance
,
she
return
to
her
work
,
whatever
that
may
be
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
woman
of
many
word
,
or
of
much
demonstration
;
few
observer
would
have
guess
how
much
she
love
her
child
;

Sylvia
,
without
any
reasoning
or
observation
,
instinctively
know
that
her
mother

heart
be
bind
up
in
her

<EOS>
Her
father

Donkin
be
go
on
much

the
other
stitching
away
as
fast
as
he
talk

They
seem
as
if
they
have
never
miss
Sylvia

no
more
do
her

for
that
matter

she
be
busy

absorb
in

afternoon
dairy

work
to
all
appearance

<EOS>
but
Sylvia
have
note
the
watch
not
three
minute
before

many
a
time
in
her
after
life
,
when
no
one
care
much
for
her
out
-
going
and
in
-
coming
,
the
straight
,
upright
figure
of
her
mother
,
front
the
set
sun
,
but
search
through
its
blind
ray
for
a
sight
of
her
child

rise
up
like
a
sudden

see
picture

the
remembrance

could
show

much
sacrifice

for

deprive

next

that

and
the

clear
up

away
from

It

<EOS>
homeward

St

the

<EOS>
They
who
go
forth
upon
the
great
deep
may
carry
solemn
thought
with
them
of
the
word
they
have
hear
there
;
not
conscious
thought
,
perhaps
 
rather
a
distinct
if
dim
conviction
that
buy
and
selling
,
eat
and
marry
,
even
life
and
death
,
be
not
all
the
reality
in
existence
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
word
that
come
up
to
their
remembrance
word
of
sermon
preach
there
,
however
impressive

<EOS>
the

mostly
sleep
through

indeed

there
be
incident
such
as

involve
in
what
be
call
"
funeral
discourse

to
be
narrate

<EOS>
They
do
not
recognize
their
daily
fault
or
temptation
under
the
grand
alias
befit
their
appearance
from
a
preacher
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
but
they
know
the
old
,
oft
-
repeat
word
pray
for
deliverance
from
the
familiar
danger
of
lightning
and
temp
;
from
battle
,
murder
,
and
sudden
death
;
and
nearly
every
man
be
aware
that
he
leave
behind
him
some
one
who
would
watch
for
the
prayer
for
the
preservation
of
those
who
travel
by
land
or
by
water
,
and
think
of
him
,
as
God
-
protect
the
more
for
the
earnestness
of
the
response
then
give
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
lie
the
dead
of
many
generation

for
St.
Nicholas

Monkshaven

<EOS>
"
there
be
a
strange
sensation
,
as
if
the
cold
sea

wind
must
bring
with
them
the
dim
phantom
of
those
lose
sailor
,
who
have
die
far
from

and
from
the
hallowed
ground
where
their
father

<EOS>
each
flight
of

up
to
this
churchyard
end
in

on

You

from
nearly
every

the

look

long
before

<EOS>
all
who
could
manage
it
have
put
on
a
bit
of
black
in
token
of
mourning
;
it
may
be
very
little
;
an
old
ribbon

a
rusty
piece

some
sign
of
mourning
be
show
by
every

down

the

full
of

at

full
of
sympathy

come
in

no

her

otherwise

<EOS>
the
unwonted
sternness

solemnity
visible
on
the
countenance

all

She

She

yet
Molly
have
come
all

Monkshaven
Church
in

and
deserved
forbearance
accordingly
.
<EOS>
the
two
mount
the
step
alongside
of
many
people
;
few
word
be
exchange
,
even
at
the
breathing
place
,
so
often
the
little
centre
of
gossip
.
<EOS>
look
over
the
sea
there
be
not
a
sail
to
be
see
;
it
seem
bare
of
life
,
as
if
to
be
in
serious
harmony
with
what
be
go
on
inland
.
  
<EOS>
the
church
be
of
old
Norman
architecture
;
low
and
massive
outside
:
inside
,
of
vast
space
,
only
a
quarter
of
which
be
fill
on
ordinary
sunday
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
disfigure
by
numerous
tablet
of
black
and
white
marble
intermix
,
and
the
usual
ornamentation
of
that
style
of
memorial
as
erect
in
the
last
century
,
of
weeping
willow
,
urn
,
and
drooping
figure
,
with
here
and
there
a
ship
in
full
sail
,
or
an
anchor
,
where
the
seafare
idea
prevalent
through
the
place
have
launch
out
into
a
little
originality
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
wood
-
work
,
the
church
have
be
strip
of
that
,
most
probably
when
the
neighbour
monastery
have
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
there
be
large
square
pew
,
line
with
green
baize
,
with
the
name
of
the
family
of
the
most
flourishing
ship
-
owner
paint
white
on
the
door
;
there
be
pew
,
not
so
large
,
and
not
line
at
all
,
for
the
farmer
and
shopkeeper
of
the
parish
;
and
numerous
heavy
oaken
bench
which
,
by
the
united
effort
of
several
man
,
may
be
bring
within
earshot
of
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
these
be
be
remove
into
the
most
convenient
situation
when
Molly
and
Sylvia
enter
the
church
,
and
after
two
or
three
whisper
sentence
they
take
their
seat
on
one
of
these
.
  
<EOS>
the
vicar
of
Monkshaven
be
a
kindly
,
peaceable
old
man
,
hate
strife
and
trouble
water
above
everything
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
vehement
Tory
in
theory
,
as
become
his
cloth
in
those
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
two
bugbear
to
fear
 
the
French
and
the
Dissenters
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
say
of
which
he
have
the
bad
opinion
and
the
most
intense
dread
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
hate
the
Dissenters
most
,
because
they
come
nearer
in
contact
with
him
than
the
French
;
besides
,
the
French
have
the
excuse
of
be
papist
,
while
the
Dissenters
may
have
belong
to
the
Church
of
England
if
they
have
not
be
utterly
deprave
.
<EOS>
yet
in
practice
Dr
Wilson
do
not
object
to
dine
with
Mr.
Fishburn
,
who
be
a
personal
friend
and
follower
of
Wesley
,
but
then
,
as
the
doctor
would
say
,
"
Wesley
be
an
Oxford
man
,
and
that
make
him
a
gentleman
;
and
he
be
an
ordain
minister
of
the
Church
of
England
,
so
that
grace
can
never
depart
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
know
what
excuse
he
would
have
allege
for
send
broth
and
vegetable
to
old
Ralph
Thompson
,
a
rabid
Independent
,
who
have
be
give
to
abuse
the
Church
and
the
vicar
,
from
a
Dissenting
pulpit
,
as
long
as
ever
he
could
mount
the
stair
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
inconsistency
between
Dr
Wilson
's
theory
and
practice
be
not
generally
know
in
Monkshaven
,
so
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Wilson
have
have
a
very
difficult
part
to
play
,
and
a
still
more
difficult
sermon
to
write
,
during
this
last
week
.
<EOS>
the
Darley
who
have
be
kill
be
the
son
of
the
vicar
's
gardener
,
and
Dr
Wilson
's
sympathy
as
a
man
have
be
all
on
the
bereave
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
have
receive
,
as
the
old
magistrate
in
the
neighbourhood
,
a
letter
from
the
captain
of
the
_
Aurora
_
,
explanatory
and
exculpatory
.
<EOS>
Darley
have
be
resist
the
order
of
an
officer
in
his
Majesty
's
service
.
<EOS>
what
would
become
of
due
subordination
and
loyalty
,
and
the
interest
of
the
service
,
and
the
chance
of
beat
those
confound
French
,
if
such
conduct
as
Darley
's
be
to
be
encourage
?
<EOS>
(
Poor
Darley
!
<EOS>
he
be
past
all
evil
effect
of
human
encouragement
now
!
)
  
<EOS>
so
the
vicar
mumble
hastily
over
a
sermon
on
the
text
,
"
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
life
we
be
in
death
"
;
which
may
have
do
as
well
for
a
baby
cut
off
in
a
convulsion
-
fit
as
for
the
strong
man
shoot
down
with
all
his
eager
blood
hot
within
him
,
by
man
as
hot
-
blooded
as
himself
.
<EOS>
but
once
when
the
old
doctor
's
eye
catch
the
up
-
turn
,
strain
gaze
of
the
father
Darley
,
seek
with
all
his
soul
to
find
a
grain
of
holy
comfort
in
the
chaff
of
word
,
his
conscience
smote
him
.
<EOS>
have
he
nothing
to
say
that
should
calm
anger
and
revenge
with
spiritual
power
?
<EOS>
no
breath
of
the
comforter
to
soothe
repining
into
resignation
?
<EOS>
but
again
the
discord
between
the
law
of
man
and
the
law
of
Christ
stand
before
him
;
and
he
give
up
the
attempt
to
do
more
than
he
be
do
,
as
beyond
his
power
.
<EOS>
though
the
hearer
go
away
as
full
of
anger
as
they
have
enter
the
church
,
and
some
with
a
dull
feeling
of
disappointment
as
to
what
they
have
get
there
,
yet
no
one
feel
anything
but
kindly
towards
the
old
vicar
.
<EOS>
His
simple
,
happy
life
lead
amongst
them
for
forty
year
,
and
open
to
all
man
in
its
daily
course
;
his
sweet
-
tempered
,
cordial
way
;
his
practical
kindness
,
make
him
beloved
by
all
;
and
neither
he
nor
<EOS>
they
think
much
or
care
much
for
admiration
of
his
talent
.
<EOS>
respect
for
his
office
be
all
the
respect
he
think
of
;
and
that
be
concede
to
him
from
old
traditional
and
hereditary
association
.
<EOS>
in
look
back
to
the
last
century
,
it
appear
curious
to
see
how
little
our
ancestor
have
the
power
of
put
two
thing
together
,
and
perceive
either
the
discord
or
harmony
thus
produce
.
<EOS>
be
it
because
we
be
farther
off
from
those
time
,
and
have
,
consequently
,
a
great
range
of
vision
?
<EOS>
Will
our
descendant
have
a
wonder
about
us
,
such
as
we
have
about
the
inconsistency
of
our
forefather
,
or
a
surprise
at
our
blindness
that
we
do
not
perceive
that
,
hold
such
and
such
opinion
,
our
course
of
action
must
be
so
and
so
,
or
that
the
logical
consequence
of
particular
opinion
must
be
conviction
which
at
present
we
hold
in
abhorrence
?
<EOS>
It
seem
puzzle
to
look
back
on
man
such
as
our
vicar
,
who
almost
hold
the
doctrine
that
the
King
could
do
no
wrong
,
yet
be
ever
ready
to
talk
of
the
glorious
Revolution
,
and
to
abuse
the
Stuarts
for
have
entertain
the
same
doctrine
,
and
try
to
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
but
such
discrepancy
run
through
good
man
's
life
in
those
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
us
that
we
live
at
the
present
time
,
when
everybody
be
logical
and
consistent
.
<EOS>
this
little
discussion
must
be
take
in
place
of
Dr
Wilson
's
sermon
,
of
which
no
one
could
remember
more
than
the
text
half
an
hour
after
it
be
deliver
.
<EOS>
even
the
doctor
himself
have
the
recollection
of
the
word
he
have
utter
sweep
out
of
his
mind
,
<EOS>
as
,
have
doff
his
gown
and
don
his
surplice
,
he
come
out
of
the
dusk
of
his
vestry
and
go
to
the
church
-
door
,
look
into
the
broad
light
which
come
upon
the
plain
of
the
church
-
yard
on
the
cliff
;
for
the
sun
have
not
yet
set
,
and
the
pale
moon
be
slowly
rise
through
the
silvery
mist
that
obscure
the
distant
moor
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
thick
,
dense
crowd
,
all
still
and
silent
,
look
away
from
the
church
and
the
vicar
,
who
await
the
bringing
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
They
be
watch
the
slow
black
line
wind
up
the
long
step
,
rest
their
heavy
burden
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
stand
in
silent
group
at
each
landing
-
place
;
now
lose
to
sight
as
a
piece
of
broken
,
overhanging
ground
intervene
,
now
emerge
suddenly
near
;
and
overhead
the
great
church
bell
,
with
its
mediaeval
inscription
,
familiar
to
the
vicar
,
if
to
no
one
else
who
hear
it
,
<EOS>
I
to
the
grave
do
summon
all
,
keep
on
its
heavy
booming
monotone
,
with
which
no
other
sound
from
land
or
sea
,
near
or
distant
,
intermingle
,
except
the
cackle
of
the
geese
on
some
far
-
away
farm
on
the
moor
,
as
they
be
come
home
to
roost
;
and
that
one
noise
from
so
great
a
distance
seem
only
to
deepen
the
stillness
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
movement
in
the
crowd
;
a
little
pushing
from
side
to
side
,
to
make
a
path
for
the
corpse
and
its
bearer
 
an
aggregate
of
the
fragment
of
room
.
  
<EOS>
with
bent
head
and
spend
strength
,
those
who
carry
the
coffin
move
on
;
behind
come
the
poor
old
gardener
,
a
brown
-
black
funeral
cloak
throw
over
his
homely
dress
,
and
support
his
wife
with
step
scarcely
less
feeble
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
church
that
afternoon
,
with
a
promise
to
her
that
he
would
return
to
lead
her
to
the
funeral
of
her
firstborn
;
for
he
feel
,
in
his
sore
perplex
heart
,
full
of
indignation
and
dumb
anger
,
as
if
he
must
go
and
hear
something
which
should
exorcize
the
unwonted
longing
for
revenge
that
disturb
his
grief
,
and
make
him
conscious
of
that
great
blank
of
consolation
which
faithfulness
produce
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
time
he
be
faithless
.
<EOS>
how
come
God
to
permit
such
cruel
injustice
of
man
?
<EOS>
permit
it
,
He
could
not
be
good
.
<EOS>
then
what
be
life
,
and
what
be
death
,
but
woe
and
despair
?
<EOS>
the
beautiful
solemn
word
of
the
ritual
have
do
him
good
,
and
restore
much
of
his
faith
.
<EOS>
though
he
could
not
understand
why
such
sorrow
have
befall
him
any
more
than
before
,
he
have
come
back
to
something
of
his
childlike
trust
;
he
keep
say
to
himself
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
mount
the
weary
step
,
"
It
be
the
Lord
's
do
"
;
and
the
repetition
soothe
him
unspeakably
.
<EOS>
behind
this
old
couple
follow
their
child
,
grown
man
and
woman
,
come
from
distant
place
or
farmhouse
service
;
the
servant
at
the
vicarage
,
and
many
a
neighbour
,
anxious
to
show
their
sympathy
,
and
most
of
the
sailor
from
the
crew
of
the
vessel
in
port
,
join
in
procession
,
and
follow
the
dead
body
into
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
too
great
a
crowd
immediately
within
the
door
for
Sylvia
and
Molly
to
go
in
again
,
and
they
accordingly
betook
themselves
to
the
place
where
the
deep
grave
be
wait
,
wide
and
hungry
,
to
receive
its
dead
.
<EOS>
there
,
lean
against
the
headstone
all
around
,
be
many
stand
 
look
over
the
broad
and
placid
sea
,
and
turn
to
the
soft
salt
air
which
blow
on
their
hot
eye
and
rigid
face
;
for
no
one
speak
of
all
that
number
.
<EOS>
They
be
think
of
the
violent
death
of
him
over
whom
the
solemn
word
be
now
be
say
in
the
gray
old
church
,
scarcely
out
of
their
hearing
,
have
not
the
sound
be
break
by
the
measure
lapping
of
the
tide
far
beneath
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
every
one
look
round
towards
the
path
from
the
churchyard
step
.
<EOS>
two
sailor
be
support
a
ghastly
figure
that
,
with
feeble
motion
,
be
draw
near
the
open
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
t
'
specksioneer
as
try
to
save
him
!
<EOS>
It
be
him
as
be
leave
for
dead
!
"
<EOS>
the
people
murmur
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Charley
Kinraid
,
as
I
be
a
sinner
!
"
<EOS>
say
Molly
,
start
forward
to
greet
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
he
come
on
,
she
see
that
all
his
strength
be
need
for
the
mere
action
of
walk
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
,
in
their
strong
sympathy
,
have
yield
to
his
earnest
entreaty
,
and
carry
him
up
the
step
,
in
order
that
he
may
see
the
last
of
his
messmate
.
<EOS>
They
place
him
near
the
grave
,
rest
against
a
stone
;
and
he
be
hardly
there
before
the
vicar
come
forth
,
and
the
great
crowd
pour
out
of
the
church
,
follow
the
body
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
so
much
wrapt
up
in
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
,
that
she
have
no
thought
to
spare
at
the
first
moment
for
the
pale
and
haggard
figure
opposite
;
much
less
be
she
aware
of
her
cousin
Philip
,
who
now
single
her
out
for
the
first
time
from
among
the
crowd
,
press
to
her
side
,
with
an
intention
of
companionship
and
protection
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
service
go
on
,
ill
-
check
sobs
rise
from
behind
the
two
girl
,
who
be
among
the
foremost
in
the
crowd
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
the
cry
and
the
wail
become
general
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
tear
rain
down
her
face
,
and
her
distress
become
so
evident
that
it
attract
the
attention
of
many
in
that
inner
circle
.
<EOS>
among
other
who
notice
it
,
the
specksioneer
's
hollow
eye
be
catch
by
the
sight
of
the
innocent
blooming
childlike
face
opposite
to
him
,
and
he
wonder
if
she
be
a
relation
;
yet
,
see
that
she
bear
no
badge
of
mourning
,
he
rather
conclude
that
she
must
have
be
a
sweetheart
of
the
dead
man
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
all
be
over
:
the
rattle
of
the
gravel
on
the
coffin
;
the
last
long
,
linger
look
of
friend
and
lover
;
the
rosemary
sprig
have
be
cast
down
by
all
who
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
bring
them
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
much
Sylvia
wish
she
have
remember
this
last
act
of
respect
 
and
slowly
the
outer
rim
of
the
crowd
begin
to
slacken
and
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
now
Philip
speak
to
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never

at

<EOS>
and
Philip
,

close
up
to
the

<EOS>
He
stop
on

<EOS>
"

"
say
he
,
faintly
,
put
out
his
hand
,
but
his
eye
pass
her
face
to
look
at
Sylvia
in
the
background
,
her
tear
-
stain
face
full
of
shy
admiration
of
the
near
approach
to
a
hero
she
have
ever

.
  
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
"

"
say
Sylvia
,
in
a
low
voice
,
long
to
speak
to
him
,
and
yet
wonder
at
her
own
temerity
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
and
he
make
as
though
he
would
turn
away

<EOS>
Kinraid
's
two
sailor
friend
back
up
Philip
's
word
with
such
urgency
,
that
,
somehow
,
Sylvia
think
they
have
be
to
blame
in
speak
to
him
,
and
blush
excessively
with
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'll
come

nurse
at
Moss
Brow

Charley

say
Molly
;
and
Sylvia
drop
her
little
maidenly
curtsey
,
and
say
,
"
good

by
;
"
and
go
away
,
wonder
how
Molly
could
talk
so
freely
to
such
a
hero
;
but
then
,
to
be
sure
,
he
be
a
cousin
,
and
probably
a
sweetheart
,
and
that
would
make
a
great
deal
of
difference

of

meanwhile
her

Philip

evidently
prepare
to
walk
back
with
the
girl
.
<EOS>
He
generally
come
to
Haytersbank
every
Sunday
afternoon
,
so
Sylvia
know
what
she
have
to
expect
the
moment
she
become
aware

<EOS>

address
herself

quickly

for

she
be

quiet
way

she
make
as
though

pass

Sylvia

all
her
sympathy
alive
for

man

want
to

more
question

put
her

a

Hester
suddenly
draw
back
a
little
,
redden
still
more

then
reply
fully

quietly
to

Sylvia
ask

<EOS>
in
the
agricultural
county
,

among
the
class
to
which
these
four
person
belong
,
there
be
little
analysis
of
motive

comparison
of
character
and
action
,
even
at
this
present
day
of
enlightenment

<EOS>
sixty
or
seventy
year
ago
there
be
still
less
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
amongst
thoughtful
and
serious
people
there
be
not
much
reading
of
such
book
as
_
Mason
_
on
_
Self
-
Knowledge
_
and
_
Law
's
Serious
call
_
,
or
that
there
be
not
the
experience
of
the
Wesleyans
,
that
be
relate
at
class
-
meeting
for
the
edification
of
the
hearer
.
<EOS>
but
,
take
as
a
general
ride
,
it
may
be
say
that
few
know
what
manner
of
man
they
be
,
compare
to
the
number
now
who
be
fully
conscious
of
their
virtue
,
quality
,
failing
,
and
weakness
,
and
who
go
about
compare
other
with
themselves
 
not
in
a
spirit
of
pharisaism
and
arrogance
,
but
with
a
vivid

we

on
the
high

raise
footway
that

alongside
of

to

<EOS>
Sylvia
have
leisure
in
her
heart
to
think
"
how
good
Hester
be
for
sit
with
the
poor
bed
-
ridden
sister
of
Darley
!
"
<EOS>
without
have
a
pang
of
self
-
depreciation
in
the
comparison
of
her
own
conduct
with
that
she
be
capable
of
so
fully
appreciate
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
to
church
for
the
end
of
vanity
,
and
remain
to
the
funeral
for
curiosity
and
the
pleasure
of
the
excitement
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
a
modern
young
lady
would
have
condemn
herself
,
and
therefore
lose
the
simple
,
purify
pleasure
of
admiration
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
pass
onwards
,
go
down
the
hill
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
other
three
walk
slowly
on
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
for
a
few
moment
,
then
Sylvia
say
    
"
how
good
she
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
Philip
reply
with
ready
warmth
,
    
"
<EOS>
yes
,
she
be
;
no
one
know
how
good
but
us

who
live
in

<EOS>
"
Her

<EOS>
molly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice

if
that
be
what

"
say
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well

<EOS>
some

particular

be
William

<EOS>
"
yes

they

"
  
"
deary
me

<EOS>
what
a
wonder
yo

can
speak
to
such
sinner
as
Sylvia
and
me
,
after
keepin

company
with
so
much
goodness
,
"
say
Molly
,
who
have
not

forgive
Philip
for

Kinraid
's
power
of
kill
man
.
<EOS>
"
be
na
'
it
,
Sylvia
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
be
too
highly
string
for
banter
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
not
be
one
of
those
who
go
to
mock
,
but
remain
to
pray
,
she
have
go
to
church
with
the
thought
of
the
cloak
-
that
-
be
-
to
-
be
uppermost
in
her
mind
,
and
she
have
come
down
the
long
church
stair
with
life
and
death
suddenly
become
real
to
her
mind
,
the
endure
sea
and
hill
form
a
contrast
background
to
the
vanish
away
of
man
.
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
a
solemn
wonder
as
to
the
abiding
-
place
of
the
soul
of
the
dead
,
and
a
childlike
dread
lest
the
number
of
the
elect
should
be
accomplish
before
she
be
include
therein
.
<EOS>
how
people
could
ever
be
merry
again
after
they
have
be
at
a
funeral
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
imagine
;
so
she
answer
gravely
,
and
slightly
beside
the
question
:
  
"
I
wonder
if
I
be
a
friend
if
I
should
be
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gi
<EOS>
'
me
<EOS>
your
red
cloak
<EOS>
,
that
be
all
,
when
yo
'
turn
Quaker
;
they
will
none
let
thee
wear
scarlet
,
so
it
will
be
of
no
use
t

thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
thou'rt
good
enough
as
thou
art
,
"
say
Philip
,
tenderly
 
at
least
as
tenderly
as
he
durst
,
for
he
know
by
experience
that
it
do
not
do
to
alarm
her
girlish
coyness
.
<EOS>
either
one
speech
or
the
other
make
Sylvia
silent
;
neither
be
accordant
to
her
mood
of
mind
;
so
perhaps
both
contribute
to
her
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
"
folk
say
William
Coulson
look
sweet
on
Hester
Rose
,
"
say
Molly
,
always
up
in
Monkshaven
gossip
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
form
of
an
assertion
,
but
be
say
in
the
tone
of
a
question
,
and
as
such
Philip
reply
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
he
like
her
a
good
deal
;
but
he
be
so
quiet
<EOS>
,
I
never
feel
sure
.
<EOS>
John
and
Jeremiah
would
like
the
match
,
I
have
a
notion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
they
come
to
the
stile
which
have
fill
Philip
's
eye
for
some
minute
past
,
though
neither
of
the
other
have
perceive
they
be
so
near
it
;
the
stile
which
lead
to
Moss
Brow
from
the
road
into
the
field
that
slope
down
to
Haystersbank
.
<EOS>
here
they
would
leave
Molly
,
and
now
would
begin
the
delicious
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
walk
,
which
Philip
always
try
to
make
as
linger
as
possible
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
he
be
anxious
to
show
his
sympathy
with
Sylvia
,
as
far
as
he
could
read
what
be
pass
in
her
mind
;
but
how
be
he
to
guess
the
multitude
of
tangle
thought
in
that
unseen
receptacle
?
<EOS>
a
resolution
to
be
good
,
if
she
could
,
and
always
to
be
think
on
death
,
so
that
what
seem
to
her
now
as
simply
impossible
,
may
come
true
 
that
she
may
"
dread
the
grave
as
little
as
her
bed
"
;
a
wish
that
Philip
be
not
come
home
with
her
;
a
wonder
if
the
specksioneer
really
have
kill
a
man
,
an
idea
which
make
her
shudder
;
yet
from
the
awful
fascination
about
it
,
her
imagination
be
compel
to
dwell
on
the
tall
,
gaunt
figure
,
and
try
to
recall
the
wan
countenance
;
a
hatred
and
desire
of
revenge
on
the
press
-
gang
,
so
vehement
that
it
sadly
militate
against
her
intention
of
try
to
be
good
;
all
these
notion
,
and
wonder
,
and
fancy
,
be
whirl
about
in
Sylvia
's
brain
,
and
at
one
of
their
prompting
she
speak
,
    
"
how
many
mile
away

Greenland
sea

<EOS>
I

how
long

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

;
<EOS>
ten
day
or
a
fortnight
,
or
more
,
maybe
.
<EOS>
I
will
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
"

I

,
Sylvie

My

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
do
not
like
learn
,
and
do
not
want
him
for
her
teacher
;
so
she
answer
in
a
dry
little
tone
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
will
use
a
deal
o
'
candle
-
light
;
mother
will
not

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
Niver
mind
about

<EOS>
I
can
bring

a
candle
wi

me
,
for
I
should
be
burn
one
at
Alice
Rose

"
  
<EOS>
so
that
excuse
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
beat
her
brain
for
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
writing
cramp
my
hand
<EOS>
so
,
I
can
not

any
sewing
for

after

and
feyth

very
bad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Sylvia
,
I
will
teach
you
geography
,
and
<EOS>
ever
such
a
vast
o

about

she
ask
,
in
a
tone
of
great
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
Arctics
,
and

,
and

,
and

;
we

we
will
do

one
night
,
and
geography
t

other

"
  
<EOS>
Philip
speak
with
pleasure
at
the
prospect
,
but
Sylvia
relax
into
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
scholard
;
it
be
like
throw
away
labour
to
teach
me
,
I
be
such
a
dunce
at
my
book
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
Betsy
Corney
,
third
girl
,
her
as
be
young
than
Molly
<EOS>
,
she
would
be
a
credit
to
you
.
<EOS>
there
niver
be
such
a
lass
for
potter
ower
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
Philip
have
have
his
wit
about
him
,
he
would
have
pretend
to
listen
to
this
proposition
of
a
change
of
pupil
,
and
then
possibly
Sylvia
may
have
repent
make
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
much
mortify
to
be
diplomatic
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
ask
me
to
teach
_
you
_
a
bit
,
not
any
neighbour
's
lass
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
if
I

I

;
<EOS>
but
I
would
rayther
be
whip
and
ha
'
do
with
it
,
"
be
Sylvia
's
ungracious
reply
.
  
<EOS>
a
moment
afterwards
,
she
repent
of
her
little
spirit
of
unkindness
,
and
think
that
she
should
not
like
to
die
that
night
without
make
friend
.
<EOS>
sudden
death
be
very
present
in
her
thought
since
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
so
she
instinctively
choose
the
good
method
of
make
friend
again
,
and
slip
her
hand
into
his
,
as
he
walk
a
little
sullenly
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
be
half
afraid
,
however
,
when
she
find
it
firmly
hold
,
and
that
she
could
not
draw
it
away
again
without
make
what
she
call
in
her
own
mind
a
"
fuss
.
"
<EOS>
so
,
hand
in
hand
,
they
slowly
and
silently
come
up
to
the
door
of
Haytersbank
Farm
;
not
unseen
by
Bell
Robson
,
who
sate
in
the
window
-
seat
,
with
her
Bible
open
upon
her
knee
.
<EOS>
She
have
read
her
chapter
aloud
to
herself
,
and
now
she
could
see
no
longer
,
even
if
she
have
wish
to
read
more
;
but
she
gaze
out
into
the
darkening
air
,
and
a
dim
look
of
contentment
come
like
moonshine
over
her
face
when
she
see
the
cousin
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
prayer
day
and
night
,
"
say
she
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
unusual
aspect
of
gladness
on
her
face
,
as
she
light
the
candle
to
give
them
a
more
cheerful
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wheere
's
feyth
?
"
say
Sylvia
,
look
round
the
room
for
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
"
He

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
talk
to
Sylvia
,
"
say
Philip
,
his
head
still
full
of
his
pleasant
plan
,
his
hand
still
tingle
from
the
touch
of
hers
,
"
about
turn
schoolmaster
,
and
come
up
here
two
night
a
week
for

a

writing
and
cipher

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
geography
,
"
put
in
Sylvia
;
"
for
,
"
think
she
,
"
if
I
be
to

them
thing
I
do
not
care
a
pin
about

anyhow
I
will
learn
what
I
do
care
to
know
,
if
it
will
tell
me
about
t
'
Greenland
sea
,
and
how
far
they
be
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
same
evening
,
a
trio
alike
in
many
outward
circumstance
sate
in
a
small
neat
room
in
a
house
opening
out
of
a
confine
court
on
the
hilly
side
of
the
High
Street
of
Monkshaven
 
a
mother
,
her
only
child
,
and
the
young
man
who
silently
love
that
daughter
,
and
be
favour
by
Alice
Rose
,
though
not
by
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
latter
return
from
her
afternoon
's
absence
,
she
stand
for
a
minute
or
two
on
the
little
flight
of
steep
step
,
whiten
to
a
snowy
whiteness
;
the
aspect
of
the
whole
house
partook
of
the
same
character
of
irreproachable
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
It
be
wedge
up
into
a
space
which
necessitate
all
sort
of
odd
projection
and
irregularity
in
order
to
obtain
sufficient
light
for
the
interior
;
and
if
ever
the
being
situate
in
a
dusky
,
confine
corner
may
have
be
make
an
excuse
for
dirt
,
Alice
Rose
's
house
have
that
apology
.
<EOS>
yet
the
small
diamond
pane
of
glass
in
the
casement
window
be
keep
so
bright
and
clear
that
a
great
sweet
-
scent
-
leaved
geranium
grow
and
flourish
,
though
it
do
not
flower
profusely
.
<EOS>
the
leave
seem
to
fill
the
air
with
fragrance
as
soon
as
Hester
summon
up
energy
enough
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
perhaps
that
be
because
the
young
Quaker
,
William
Coulson
,
be
crush
one
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
while
wait
to
set
down
Alice
's
next
word
.
<EOS>
for
the
old
woman
,
who
look
as
if
many
year
of
life
remain
in
her
yet
,
be
solemnly
dictate
her
last
will
and
testament
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
on
her
mind
for
many
month
;
for
she
have
something
to
leave
beyond
the
mere
furniture
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
something
 
<EOS>
a
few
pound
 
in
the
hand
of
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
her
cousin
:
and
it
be
they
who
have
suggest
the
duty
on
which
she
be
engage
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
William
Coulson
to
write
down
her
wish
,
and
he
have
consent
,
though
with
some
fear
and
trepidation
;
for
he
have
an
idea
that
he
be
infringe
on
a
lawyer
's
prerogative
,
and
that
,
for
aught
he
know
,
he
may
be
prosecute
for
make
a
will
without
a
licence
,
just
as
a
man
may
be
punish
for
sell
wine
and
spirit
without
go
through
the
preliminary
legal
form
that
give
permission
for
such
a
sale
.
<EOS>
but
to
his
suggestion
that
Alice
should
employ
a
lawyer
,
she
have
reply
    
"
that
would
cost
me
five
pound
sterling
;
and
thee
canst
do
it
as
well
,
if
thee'll
<EOS>
but
attend
to
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
have
buy
,
at
her
desire
,
a
black
-
edge
sheet
of
fine
-
wove
paper
,
and
a
couple
of
good
pen
,
on
the
previous
Saturday
;
and
while
wait
for
her
to
begin
her
dictation
,
and
full
serious
thought
himself
,
he
have
almost
unconsciously
make
the

then
there
be
meat
to
salt
while
it
could

;
for
,
in
default
of
turnip
and
mangold
-
wurzel
,
there
be
a
great
slaughtering
of
barren
cow
as
soon
as
the
summer
herbage
fail
;
and
good
housewife
store
up
their
Christmas
piece

<EOS>
corn

<EOS>
and
last
of
all
come
the
pig
-
killing
,
when
the
second
frost
set
in
.
<EOS>
for
up
in
the
north
there
be
an
idea
that
the
ice
store
in
the
first
frost
will
melt
,
and
the
meat
cure
then
taint
;
the
first
frost
be
good
for
nothing
but
to

throw
away
,
as
they
express
it

<EOS>
there
come
a
breathing

time
after
this
last
event
.
<EOS>
the

have
have
its

autumn
cleaning
,
and
be
neat

bright
from

from

the

the

;
the

ground
;
the
pig
kill
,
and
the
ham
and
head
and

lie
in
salt
.
<EOS>
the
butcher
have
be
glad
to
take
the
good
part
of
a
pig
of
Dame
Robson
's
careful
feeding
;
but
there
be
unusual
plenty
in
the
Haytersbank
pantry
;
and
as
Bell
survey
it
one
morning
,
she
say
to
her
husband
    
"
I
wonder
if
yon
poor
sick
chap
at
Moss
Brow
would
fancy
some
o

my
sausage

<EOS>
They
be
something
to
crack
on
,
for
they

fra

an

Cumberland
receipt
,
as

i

.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou

so
set

Cumberland

"
say
her
husband
,
not
displeased
with
the
suggestion
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
still
,
when
folk
's
sick
they
han
their
fancy
,
and
maybe
Kinraid
will
be
glad
o

thy
sausage
.
<EOS>
I
ha

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
complimentary
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
but
Daniel
go
on
to
say
that
he
do
not
mind
if
he
step
over
with
the
sausage
himself
,
when
it
be
too
late
to
do
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
long
to
offer
to
accompany
her
father
;
but
,
somehow
,
she
do
not
like
to
propose
it
.
<EOS>
towards
dusk
she
come
to
her
mother
to
ask
for
the
key
of
the
great
bureau
that
stand
in
the
house
-
place
as
a
state
piece
of
furniture
,
although
its
use
be
to
contain
the
family
's
good
wear
apparel
,
and
store
of
linen
,
such
as
may
be
suppose
to
be
more
need
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
for
do
yo
'
want
my
key
?
"
ask
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
just
to
get
out
one
of
t
'
damask
napkin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
the
good
napkin
,
as
my
mother
span
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
!
"
say
Sylvia
,
her
colour
heighten
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
as
how
it
would
set
off
t
'
sausage
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
good
clean
homespun
cloth
will
serve
them
better
,
"
say
Bell
,
wonder
in
her
own
mind
what
be
come
over
the
girl
,
to
be
think
of
set
off
sausage
that
be
to
be
eat
,
not
to
be
look
at
like
a
picture
-
book
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
wonder
still
more
,
if
she
have
see
Sylvia
steal
round
to
the
little
flower
border
she
have
persuade
Kester
to
make
under
the
wall
at
the
sunny
side
of
the
house
,
and
gather
the
two
or
three
Michaelmas
daisy
,
and
the
one
bud
of
the
China
rise
,
that
,
grow
against
the
kitchen
chimney
,
have
escape
the
frost
;
and
then
,
when
her
mother
be
not
look
,
softly
open
the
cloth
inside
of
the
little
basket
that
contain
the
sausage
and
a
fresh
egg
or
two
,
and
lie
her
autumn
blossom
in
one
of
the
fold
of
the
towel
.
  
<EOS>
after
Daniel
,
now
pretty
clear
of
his
rheumatism
,
have
have
his
afternoon
meal
<EOS>
(
tea
be
a
Sunday
treat
)
,
he
prepare
to
set
out
on
his
walk
to
Moss
Brow
;
but
as
he
be
take
his
stick
he
catch
the
look
on
Sylvia
's
face
;
and
unconsciously
interpret
its
dumb
wistfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"

he
,
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
She
may
as
well

and
see
Molly
a
bit

she
will

"
  
<EOS>
Bell
consider
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
t

yarn
for

but
she

there

"
  
"

then
,

be
off

"
say
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
and
Sylvia
do
not
need
another
word
.
<EOS>
down
she
come
in
a
twinkling
,
dress
in
her
new
red
cloak
and
hood
,
her
face
peep
out
of
the
fold
of
the
latter
,
bright
and
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
should'st

for

"
say
Bell
,
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
take
it
off
,
and
put

"
ask
Sylvia
,
a
little
dolefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na

Lassie

"
<EOS>
(
this
last
to
his
dog
)
.
  
<EOS>
so
Sylvia
set
off
with
a
dance
heart
and
a
dancing
step
,
that
have
to
be
restrain
to
the
sober
gait
her
father
choose
.
<EOS>
the
sky
above
be
bright
and
clear
with
the
light
of
a
thousand
star
,
the
grass
be
crisp
under
their
foot
with
the
come
hoar
frost
;
and
as
they
mount
to
the
high
ground
they
could
see
the
dark
sea
stretch
away
far
below
them
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
very
still
,
though
now
<EOS>
and
then
crisp
sound
in
the
distant
air
sound
very
near
in
the
silence
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
carry
the
basket
,
and
look
like
little
Red
Riding
Hood
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
nothing
to
say
,
and
do
not
care
to
make
himself
agreeable
;
but
Sylvia
enjoy
her
own
thought
,
and
any
conversation
would
have
be
a
disturbance
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
long
monotonous
roll
of
the
distant
wave
,
as
the
tide
bear
them
in
,
the
multitudinous
rush
at
last
,
and
then
the
retreat
rattle
and
trickle
,
as
the
baffle
water
fall
back
over
the
shingle
that
skirt
the
sand
,
and
divide
them
from
the
cliff
;
her
father
's
measured
tread
,
and
slow
,
even
movement
;
Lassie
's
pattering
 
all
lull
Sylvia
into
a
reverie
,
of
which
she
could
not
have
give
herself
any
definite
account
.
<EOS>
but
at
length
they
arrive
at
Moss
Brow
,
and
with
a
sudden
sigh
she
quit
the
subject
of
her
dreamy
meditation
,
and
follow
her
father
into
the
great
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
It
have
a
more
comfortable
aspect
by
night
than
by
day
.
<EOS>
the
fire
be
always
keep
up
to
a
wasteful
size
,
and
the
dancing
blaze
and
the
partial
light
of
candle
leave
much
in
shadow
that
be
best
ignore
in
such
a
disorderly
family
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
always
a
warm
welcome
to
friend
,
however
roughly
give
;
and
after
the
word
of
this
be
speak
,
the
next
rise
up
equally
naturally
in
the
mind
of
Mrs
Corney
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
will
ye
tak
'
?
<EOS>
eh
!
<EOS>
but
t
'
measter
will
be
fine
and
vexed
at
your
comin

when
he
be
away
.
<EOS>
He
be
off
to
Horncastle
t

sell
some
colt
,
and
he
will
not
be
back
till
to

<EOS>
but
here
be
Charley
Kinraid
as

"
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
address
to
Daniel
,
to
whom
she
know
that
none
but
masculine
company
would
be
acceptable
.
<EOS>
amongst
uneducated
people
 
whose
range
of
subject
and
interest
do
not
extend
beyond
their
daily
life
 
it
be
natural
that
when
the
first
blush
and
hurry
of
youth
be
over
,
there
should
be
no
great
pleasure
in
the
conversation
of
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
man
have
plenty
to
say
to
man
,
which
in
their
estimation
(
gain
from
tradition
and
experience
)
<EOS>
woman
can
not
understand
;
and
farmer
of
a
much
late
date
than
the
one
of
which
I
be
write
,
would
have
contemptuously
consider
it
as
a
loss
of
time
to
talk
to
woman
;
indeed
,
they
be
often
more
communicative
to
the
sheep
-
dog
that
accompany
them
through
all
the
day
's
work
,
and
frequently
become
a
sort
of
dumb
confidant
.
<EOS>
Farmer
Robson
's
Lassie
now
lie
down
at
her
master
's
foot
,
place
her
nose
between
her
paw
,
and
watch
with
attentive
eye
the
preparation
go
on
for
refreshment
 
preparation
which
,
to
the
disappointment
of
her
canine
heart
,
consist
entirely
of
tumbler
and
sugar
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
t
'
wench
?
"
say
Robson
,
after
he
have
shake
hand
with
Kinraid
,
and
speak
a
few
word
to
him
and
to
Mrs.
Corney
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
getten
'
a
basket
wi
'
sausage
in

,
as
my
missus
have
make
,
and
she
be
a
rare
hand
at
sausage

there

noane
like
her
in
a
'
t
'
three
Ridings

I
will

"
  
<EOS>
for
Daniel
could
praise
his
wife
's
power
in
her
absence
,
though
he
do
not
often
express
himself
in
an
appreciative
manner
when
she
be
by
to
hear
.
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
's
quick
sense
catch
up
the
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Corney
would
apply
the
way
in
which
her
mother
's
housewifery
have
be
exalt
,
and
step
forwards
out
of
the
shadow
,
she
say
,
    
"
Mother
think
,
maybe
,
you
have
not
kill
a
pig
yet

and

savoury
for
any
one
who
be

well

'
  
<EOS>
She
may
have
go
on
but
that
she
catch
Kinraid
's
eye
look
at
her
with
kindly
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
stop
speak
,
and
Mrs.
Corney
take
up
the
word
    
"
<EOS>
as
for
sausage
,
I
ha
'
niver
have
a
chance
this
year
,
else
I
stand
again
any
one
for
t
'
making
of
'em
.
<EOS>
Yorkshire
hams
be
a
vast
thought
on
,
and
I
will
niver
let
another
county
woman
say
as
she
can
make
well
sausage
nor
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
I
would
niver
a
chance
;
for
our
pig
,
as
I
be
sa
fond
on
,
and
fed
mysel
'
,
and
as
would
ha
'
be
fourteen
stone
by
now
if
he
be
an
ounce
,
and
as
know
me
as
well
as
any
Christian
,
and
a
pig
,
as
I
may
say
,
that
I
just
idolize
,
go
and
take
a
fit
a
week
after
Michaelmas
Day
,
and
die
,
as
if
it
have
be
to
spite
me
;
and
t
'
next
be
na
'
ready
for

,
nor
wunnot

<EOS>
so
I
be
much
beholden
to
your

<EOS>
so

I
be
sure

though
he

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

better

Kinraid

a'most
ready

folk

add
Daniel

<EOS>
"
They
be
go
down
towards
Hull
,
as
I
have

Kinraid

but
they
be
a
deep
set

they
will
be

some

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

exhibit

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
he
begin
the
story
Sylvia
know
so
well
;
for
her
father
never
make
a
new
acquaintance
but
what
he
tell
him
of
his
self
-
mutilation
to
escape
the
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
do
,
as
he
would
himself
have
own
,
to
spite
himself
as
well
as
them
;
for
it
have
oblige
him
to
leave
a
sea
-
life
,
to
which
,
in
comparison
,
all
life
spend
on
shore
be
bad
than
nothing
for
dulness
.
<EOS>
for
Robson
have
never
reach
that
rank
aboard
ship
which
make
his
be
unable
to
run
up
the
rigging
,
or
to
throw
a
harpoon
,
or
to
fire
off
a
gun
,
of
no
great
consequence
;
so
he
have
to
be
thankful
that
an
opportune
legacy
enable
him
to
turn
farmer
,
a
great
degradation
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
but
his
blood
warm
,
as
he
tell
the
specksioneer
,
towards
a
sailor
,
and
he
press
Kinraid
to
beguile
the
time
when
he
be
compel
to
be
ashore

by
come
over
to
see
him
at

<EOS>
Sylvia

in
reality

all
this
conversation

<EOS>
Sylvia
come
forwards
,
ruddy
as
any
rose
,
and
in
a
moment
Kinraid
recognize
her
as
the
pretty
little
girl
he
have
see
cry
so
bitterly
over
Darley
's
grave
.
<EOS>
He
rise
up
out
of
true
sailor
's
gallantry
,
as
she
shyly
approach
and
stand
by
her
father
's
side
,
scarcely
daring
to
lift
her
great
soft
eye
,
to
have
one
fair
gaze
at
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
support
himself
by
one
hand
rest
on
the
dresser
,
but
she
see
he
be
look
far
well
 
<EOS>
young
,
less
haggard
 
than
he
have
seem
to
her
before
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
short
and
expressive
;
his
complexion
have
be
weatherbeaten
and
bronze
,
though
now
he
look
so
pale
;
his
eye
and
hair
be
dark
,
 
<EOS>
the
former
quick
,
deep
-
set
,
and
penetrating
;
the
latter
curly
,
and
almost
in
ringlet
.
<EOS>
His
tooth
gleam
white
as
he
smile
at
her
,
a
pleasant
friendly
smile
of
recognition
;
but
she
only
blush
the
deep
,
and
hang
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
,
sir
,
and
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
a
turn'll
do
me
good
,
if
the
weather
hold
up

keep
on

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
right

my

say
Robson
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
then
Kinraid
's
hand
be
hold
out
to
Sylvia
,
and
she
could
not
avoid
the
same
friendly
action
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
Corney
follow
her
to
the
door
,
and
when
they
be
fairly
outside
,
she
hold
Sylvia
back
for
an
instant
to
say
,
    
"
be
na
'
<EOS>
he
a
fine
likely
man
?
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
as
yo've
see
him
,
for
he
be
to
be
off
next
week
to
Newcastle
and
that
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
say
he
would
come
to
us
some
night
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Sylvia
,
half
in
a
fright
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
I
will
see
as
he
do
;
never
fear
.
<EOS>
for
I
should
like
yo

for
to
know
him
a
bit

I
will
mind
him

"
  
<EOS>
somehow
,
Sylvia
feel
as
if
this
repeat
promise
of
remind
Kinraid
of
his
promise
to
come
and
see
her
father
take
away
part
of
the
pleasure
she
have
anticipate
from
his
visit
.
<EOS>
yet
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
Molly
Corney
should
wish
her
friend
to
be
acquaint
with
the
man
whom
Sylvia
believe
to
be
all
but
Molly
's
engage
lover
?
  
<EOS>
ponder
these
thought
,
the
walk
home
be
as
silent
as
that
go
to
Moss
Brow
have
be
.
<EOS>
the
only
change
seem
to
be
that
now
they
face
the
brilliant
northern
light
flash
up
the
sky
,
and
that
either
this
appearance
or
some
of
the
whale
narration
of
Kinraid
have
stir
up
Daniel
Robson
's
recollection
of
a
sea
ditty
,
which
he
keep
singe
to
himself
in
a
low
,
unmusical
voice

the
burden
of
which

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry

Sylvia
,
more
out
of
deference
to
her
mother
's
tone
of
annoyance
,
than
because
she
herself
care
either
for

her

disappointment

<EOS>
"
He
will
come

thou
must
take

<EOS>
Sylvia
may
have
repeat
her
"
I
be
very
sorry

at
this
announcement
of
Philip

she
restrain
herself
,
inwardly

fervently
hope
that
Molly
would
not
urge
the
fulfilment
of
the
specksioneer
's
promise

for
Philip
's
be
there
would
spoil

besides
,
if
she
sate
at
the
dresser
at
her
lesson
,
and
Kinraid
at
the
table
with
her

he
may
hear
all

find
out

with

not

<EOS>
after
a
few
word
to
her
mother

Philip
produce
the
candle
he
have
promise

some
book

a
quill
or
two

<EOS>
"
what
for

<EOS>
ask
Bell
,
in
a
half

affront
tone

<EOS>
Hepburn
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
think
it
would
take
a
deal
of
candlelight
,
and
be
for
make
it
into
a
reason
not
to
learn
.
<EOS>
I
should
ha

stay
at

so
I
just
bring
them

me

<EOS>
"
then
thou
may'st
just
take
them
back
again

say
Bell
,
shortly
,
blow
out
that
which
he
have
light
,
and
place
one
of
her
own
on
the
dresser
instead

<EOS>
Sylvia
catch
her
mother
's
look
of
displeasure
,
and
it
make
her
docile
for
the
evening
,
although
she
owe
her
cousin
a
grudge
for
her
enforced
good
behaviour

quiet

bestow
upon

Sylvia
take
her
book

glance
down
the
column
Philip
point
out
to
her

but
,
as
she
justly
consider
,
one
man
may
point
out
the
task
,
but
twenty
could
not
make
her
learn
it

if

do
not
choose

she
sit

down
on

his

hear
these
word
he
be
discreet
enough
not
to
show
that
he
hear

and
he
have
his
reward
;
for
in
a
very
short
time
,
Sylvia
stand
before
him
with
her
book
in
her
hand
,
prepare
to
say
her
spelling
.
<EOS>
at
which
he
also
stand
up
by
instinct
,
and
listen
to
her
slow
succeed
letter
;
help
her
out
,
when
she
look
up
at
him
with
a
sweet
childlike
perplexity
in
her
face
:
for
a
dunce
as
to
book
-
learn
<EOS>
poor
Sylvia
be
and
be
likely
to
remain
;
and
,
in
spite
of
his
assumed
office
of
schoolmaster
,
Philip
Hepburn
could
almost
have
echo
the
word
of
the
lover
of
Jess
MacFarlane
      
<EOS>
I
send
my
love
a
letter
,

,
alas

she
canna

<EOS>
still
he
know
his
aunt

strong
wish
on
the
subject

it
be
very
delightful
to
stand
in
the
relation
of
teacher
to
<EOS>
so
dear
and
pretty
,
if
so
wilful
,
a
pupil
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
not
very
flattering
to
notice
Sylvia
's
great
joy
when
her
lesson
be
over
,
sadly
shorten
as
they
be
by
Philip

desire
not

hard

Sylvia
dance
round
to
her

bend
her
head
back

her
face

defyingly
to

at
this
moment
her
father
come
in
from
a
distant
expedition
on
the
moor
with
Kester
to
look
after
the
sheep
he
have
pasture
there
before
the
winter
set
fairly
in
.
<EOS>
He
be
tired
,
and
so
be
Lassie

and
so

too

be
Kester

who
,
lift
his
heavy
leg
one
after
the
other

and
smooth
down
his
hair
,
follow
his
master
into
the
house

place
,
and
seat
himself
on
a
bench
at
the
farther
end
of
the
dresser

patiently
await
the
supper
of
porridge
and
milk
which
he
share
with
his
master

Sylvia
,
meanwhile
,
coax
Lassie
 
poor
footsore
dog
 
to
her
side

and
give
her
some
food
,
which
the
creature
be
almost
too
tired
to
eat
.

Philip
make
as
though
he
would
be
go
,
but
Daniel
motion
to
him
to
be
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
thee
down
,
lad

<EOS>
as
soon
as
I

I
want

hear
a
bit
o

news

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
take
her
sewing
and
sit
at
the
little
round
table
by
her
mother
,
share
the
light
of
the
scanty
dip
-
candle
.
<EOS>
no
one
speak
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
absorb
in
what
they
be
do

<EOS>
what
Philip
be
do
be
,
gaze
at
Sylvia
 
learn
her
face
off
by
heart

<EOS>
when
every
scrap
of
porridge
be
clear
out
of
the
mighty
bowl
,
Kester
yawn
,
and
wish
good
-
night
,
withdraw
to
his
loft
over
the
cow
-
house
.
<EOS>
then
Philip
pull
out
the
weekly
York
paper
,
and
begin
to
read
the
late
account
of
the
war
then
rage
.
<EOS>
this
be
give
Daniel
one
of
his
great
pleasure
;
for
though
he
could
read
pretty
well
,
yet
the
double
effort
of
reading
and
understanding
what
he
read
be
almost
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
read
,
or
he
could
understand
what
be
read
aloud
to
him
;
read
be
no
pleasure
,
but
listening
be
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
he
have
a
true
John
bullish
interest
in
the
war
,
without
very
well
know
what
the
English
be
fight
for
.
<EOS>
but
in
those
day
,
so
long
as
they
fight
the
French
for
any
cause
,
or
for
no
cause
at
all
,
every
true
patriot
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
do
not
care
for
any
such
far
-
extended
interest
;
a
little
bit
of
York
news
,
the
stealing
of
a
few
apple
out
of
a
Scarborough
garden
that
they
know
,
be
of
far
more
interest
to
them
than
all
the
battle
of
Nelson
and
the
North
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
read
in
a
high
-
pitched
and
unnatural
tone
of
voice
,
which
deprive
the
word
of
their
reality
;
for
even
familiar
expression
can
become
unfamiliar
and
convey
no
idea
,
if
the
utterance
be
force
or
affect
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
somewhat
of
a
pedant
;
yet
there
be
a
simplicity
in
his
pedantry
not
always
to
be
meet
with
in
those
who
be
self
-
teach
,
and
which
may
have
interest
any
one
who
care
to
know
with
what
labour
and
difficulty
he
have
acquire
the
knowledge
which
now
he
prize
so
highly
;
read
out
latin
quotation
as
easily
as
if
they
be
English
,
and
take
a
pleasure
in
rolling
polysyllable
,
until
all
at
once
look
askance
at

to

who

the

<EOS>
a
few
day
after
,
Farmer
Robson
leave
Haytersbank
betime
on
a
longish
day
's
journey
,
to
purchase
a
horse
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
be
busy
with
a
hundred
household
thing
,
and
the
early
winter
's
evening
close
in
upon
them
almost
before
they
be
aware
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
darkness
in
the
country
even
now
be
to
gather
the
member
of
a
family
together
into
one
room
,
and
to
make
them
settle
to
some
sedentary
employment
;
and
it
be
much
more
the
case
at
the
period
of
my
story
,
when
candle
be
far
dearer
than
they
be
at
present
,
and
when
one
be
often
make
to
suffice
for
a
large
family
.
  
<EOS>
the
mother
and
daughter
hardly
speak
at
all
when
they
sit
down
at
last
.
<EOS>
the
cheerful
click
of
the
knitting
-
needle
make
a
pleasant
home
-
sound
;
and
in
the
occasional
snatch
of
slumber
that
overcome
her
mother
,
Sylvia
could
hear
the
long
-
rush
boom
of
the
wave
,
down
below
the
rock
,
for
the
Haytersbank
gulley
allow
the
sullen
roar
to
come
up
so
far
inland
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
about
eight
o'clock
 
though
from
the
monotonous
course
of
the
evening
<EOS>
it
seem
much
later
 
when
Sylvia
hear
her
father
's
heavy
step
cranch
down
the
pebbly
path
.
<EOS>
more
unusual
,
she
hear
his
voice
talk
to
some
companion
.
  
<EOS>
curious
to
see
who
it
could
be
,
with
a
lively
instinctive
advance
towards
any
event
which
may
break
the
monotony
she
have
begin
to
find
somewhat
dull
,
she
spring
up
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
half
a
glance
into
the
gray
darkness
outside
make
her
suddenly
timid
,
and
she
draw
back
behind
the
door
as
she
open
it
wide
to
admit
her
father
and
Kinraid
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
Robson
come
in
bright
and
boisterous
.
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
with
his
purchase
,
and
have
have
some
drink
to
celebrate
his
bargain
.
<EOS>
He
have
ride
the
new
mare
into
Monkshaven
,
and
leave
her
at
the
smithy
there
until
morning
,
to
have
her
foot
look
at
,
and
to
be
new
shod
.
<EOS>
on
his
way
from
the
town
he
have
meet
Kinraid
wander
about
in
search
of
Haytersbank
Farm
itself
,
so
he
have
just
bring
him
along
with
him
;
and
here
they
be
,
ready
for
bread
and
cheese
,
and
aught
else
<EOS>
the
mistress
would
set
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
Sylvia
the
sudden
change
into
brightness
and
bustle
occasion
by
the
entrance
of
her
father
and
<EOS>
the
specksioneer
be
like
that
which
you
may
effect
any
winter
's
night
,
when
you
come
into
a
room
where
a
great
lump
of
coal
lie
hot
and
slumber
on
the
fire
;
just
break
it
up
with
a
judicious
blow
from
the
poker
,
and
the
room
,
late
so
dark
,
and
dusk
,
and
lone
,
be
full
of
life
,
and
light
,
and
warmth
.
  
<EOS>
She
move
about
with
pretty
household
briskness
,
attend
to
all
her
father
's
want
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
's
eye
watch
her
as
she
go
backwards
and
forwards
,
to
and
fro
,
into
the
pantry
,
the
back
-
kitchen
,
out
of
light
into
shade
,
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
broad
firelight
where
he
could
see
and
note
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
wear
the
high
-
crown
linen
cap
of
that
day
,
surmount
her
lovely
masse
of
golden
brown
hair
,
rather
than
conceal
them
,
and
tie
firm
to
her
head
by
a
broad
blue
ribbon
.
<EOS>
a
long
curl
hang
down
on
each
side
of
her
neck
 
<EOS>
her
throat
<EOS>
rather
,
for
her
neck
be
conceal
by
a
little
spot
handkerchief
carefully
pin
across
at
the
waist
of
her
brown
stuff
gown
.
  
<EOS>
how
well
it
be
,
think
the
young
girl
,
that
she
have
doff
her
bed
-
gown
and
linsey
-
woolsey
petticoat
,
her
working
-
dress
,
and
make
herself
smart
in
her
stuff
gown
,
when
she
sate
down
to
work
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
she
could
sit
down
again
,
her
father
and
Kinraid
have
their
glass
fill
,
and
be
talk
of
the
relative
merit
of
various
kind
of
spirit
;
that
lead
on
to
tale
of
smuggling
,
and
the
different
contrivance
by
which
they
or
their
friend
have
elude
the
preventive
service
;
the
nightly
relay
of
man
to
carry
the
good
inland
;
the
keg
of
brandy
find
by
certain
farmer
whose
horse
have
go
so
far
in
the
night
,
that
they
could
do
no
work
the
next
day
;
the
clever
way
in
which
certain
woman
manage
to
bring
in
prohibit
good
;
in
fact
,
that
when
a
woman
do
give
her
mind
to
smuggling
,
she
be
more
full
of
resource
,
and
trick
,
and
impudence
,
and
energy
than
any
man
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
question
of
the
morality
of
the
affair
;
one
of
the
great
sign
of
the
real
progress
we
have
make
since
those
time
seem
to
be
that
our
daily
concern
of
buy
and
selling
,
eating
and
drink
,
whatsoever
we
do
,
be
more
test
by
the
real
practical
standard
of
our
religion
than
they
be
in
the
day
of
our
grandfather
.
<EOS>
neither
Sylvia
nor
her
mother
be
in
advance
of
their
age
.
<EOS>
both
listen
with
admiration
to
the
ingenious
device
,
and
act
as
well
as
speak
lie
,
that
be
talk
about
as
fine
and
spirited
thing
.
<EOS>
yet
if
Sylvia
have
attempt
one
tithe
of
this
deceit
in
her
every
-
day
life
,
it
would
have
half
break
her
mother
's
heart
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
duty
on
salt
be
strictly
and
cruelly
enforce
,
make
it
penal
to
pick
up
rough
dirty
lump
contain
small
quantity
that
may
be
throw
out
with
the
ashe
of
the
brine
-
house
on
the
high
-
road
;
when
the
price
of
this
necessary
be
so
increase
by
the
tax
upon
it
as
to
make
it
an
expensive
,
sometimes
an
unattainable
,
luxury
to
the
work
man
,
Government
do
more
to
demoralise
the
popular
sense
of
rectitude
and
uprightness
than
heap
of
sermon
could
undo
.
<EOS>
and
the
same
,
though
in
small
measure
,
be
the
consequence
of
many
other
taxis
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
curious
to
trace
up
the
popular
standard
of
truth
to
taxation
;
but
I
do
not
think
the
idea
would
be
so
very
far
-
fetched
.
  
<EOS>
from
smuggling
adventure
it
be
easy
to
pass
on
to
story
of
what
have
happen
to
Robson
,
in
his
youth
a
sailor
in
the
Greenland
sea
,
and
to
Kinraid
,
now
one
of
the
good
harpooner
in
any
whaler
that
sail
off
the
coast
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
three
thing
to
be
afeare
on
,
"
say
Robson
,
authoritatively
:
"
there
be
t
'
ice
<EOS>
,
that
be
bad
;
there
be
dirty
weather
,
that
be
bad
;
and
there
be
whale
theirselve
,
as
be
t
'
bad
of
all
<EOS>
;
leastways
,
they
be
i
'
<EOS>
my
day
;
t
'
darn

<EOS>
when
I
be
young
,
they
could
niver

get
to

wi'out
<EOS>

<EOS>
their

and
their

,
till
t

say
be
all
in
a

,
and
t

crew
be
all
o'er
wi

which
i

them
latitude
be
a
kind
o

bath
not

<EOS>
"
  
"
th
'
whale
have
not
mend
their
manner
,
as
you
call
it
,
"
say
Kinraid
;
"
but
th
'
ice
be
not
to
be
speak
lightly
on
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
in
th
'
ship
_
John
_
of
Hull
,
and
we
be
in
good
green
water
,
and
be
keen
after
whale
;
and
ne'er
think
harm
of
a
great
gray
iceberg
as
be
on
our
lee
-
bow
,
a
mile
or
so
off
;
it
look
as
if
it
have
be
there
from
the
day
of
Adam
,
and
be
likely
to
see
th
'
last
man
out
,
and
it
ne'er
a
bit
big
nor
small
in
all
them
<EOS>
thousand
and
thousand
o

.
<EOS>
well
,
the
fast
-
boat
be
out
after
a
fish
,
and
I
be
specksioneer
in
one
;
and
we
be
so
keen
after
capture
our
whale
,
that
none
on
us
ever
see
that
we
be
drift
away
from
them
right
into
deep
shadow
o
'
th
'
iceberg
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
set
upon
our
whale
,
and
I
harpoon
it
;
and
as
soon
as
it
be
dead
we
lash
its
fin
together
,
and
fasten
its
tail
to
our
boat
;
and
then
we
take
breath
and
look
about
us
,
and
away
from
us
a
little
space
be
th
'
other
boat
,
wi
'
two
other
fish
make
play
,
and
as
likely
as
not
to
break
loose
,
for
I
may
say
as
I
be
th
'
good
harpooner
on
board
the
_
John
_
,
<EOS>
wi'out
<EOS>
say
great
thing
<EOS>
o

so
I

My

you

we

"

say
Robson
;
"
one

"
  
<EOS>

well

luckily

ne'er

a

who
be

and
no

answer
,
for
they
be
all
as
keen
as
me
for
to
go
and
help
our

and
we
think
as
we
could
come
back
to
our
dead
fish
,
as
have
a
boat
for
a

once
we

so
off
we

out

well

we

<EOS>
down
wi

a

noise
,
and
then
a
gulp
of
the
deep

,
and
then
a

o

and
when
we
have

down

there
be
never

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
e'er
<EOS>
a

to

but
th

be
there
,
still
and
grim
,
as
if
a

fall
off

<EOS>
th

They

i

well

we

i

th

a

seeking
for

,
close
on

there
be
a
great
wall
o

ice
,
as
much
as
sixty
foot
high
.
<EOS>
and
say
our
captain
 
as
be
a
dare

devil
,
if
ever

be
 
"
there
will
be
an
opening

into

I

if
I
coast
along
it

"
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
our
sailing
,
we
never
seem
to
come
near
to
th

.
<EOS>
the
water
be
rock
beneath

the
sky
be
steady
above

th

rise
out

o

the

seem
to
reach
up
into

<EOS>
We
sail
on

we
sail
on

for

day
nor
I

<EOS>
Our
captain
be
a
strange
,
wild
man
,
but
once
he
look
a
little
pale
when
he
come
upo
'
deck
after
his
turn
-
in
,
and
see
the
green

gray
ice
go
straight
up
on

beam
.
<EOS>
many
on
us
think
as
the
ship
be
bewitch
for
th
'
captain
's
word
;
and
we
get
to
speak
low
,
and
to
say
our
prayer
o
'
night
,
and
a
kind
<EOS>
o
'
dull
silence
come
into
th

air
;
our

do
na

rightly
seem
our

.
<EOS>
and
we
sail
on
,
and
we
sail
on
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
th
'
man
as
be
on
watch
give
a
cry
:
he
see
a
break
in
the
ice
,
as
we
would
begin
to
think
be
everlasting
;
and
we
all
gather
towards
the
bow
,
and
the
captain
call
to
th
'
man
at
the
helm
to
keep
her
course
,
and
cock
his
head
,
and
begin
to
walk
the
quarter
-
deck
jaunty
again
.
<EOS>
and
we
come
to
a
great
cleft
in
th
'
long
weary
rock
of
ice
;
and
the
side
o
'
th
'
cleft
be
not
jag
,
but
go
straight
sharp
down
into
th
'
foam
water
.
<EOS>
but
we
take
but
one
look
at
what
lie
inside
,
for
our
captain
,
with
a
loud
cry
to
God
,
bade
the
helmsman
steer
<EOS>
nor'ards
away
<EOS>
fra
'
th
'
mouth
o
'
<EOS>
Hell
.
<EOS>
We
all
see
wi
'
our
own
eye
,
inside
that
fearsome
wall
o
'
ice
 
seventy
mile
long
,
as
we
could
swear
to
 
inside
that
gray
,
cold
ice
,
come
leap
flame
,
all
red
and
yellow
wi
'
<EOS>
heat
o
'
some
unearthly
kind
out
<EOS>
o
'
th
'
very
water
<EOS>
o
'
the
sea
;
make
our
eye
dazzle
wi
'
their
scarlet
blaze
,
that
shoot
up
as
high
,
nay
,
high
than
th
'
ice
around
,
yet
never
so
much
as
a
shre
on

<EOS>
t

melt

<EOS>
They
do
say
that
some
beside
our
captain
see
the
black
devil
dart
hither
and
thither
,
quick
than
the
very
flame
themselves
;
anyhow
,
he
see
them
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
know
it
be
his
own
daring
as
have
lead
him
to
have
that
peep
at
terror
forbid
to
any
on
us
<EOS>
afore

he
just
dwine
away
,
and
we
have
not
take
but
one
whale
afore

die
,

mate
take
th

<EOS>
It
be

for

I

Bell

<EOS>
how
well
I
mind
yo'r
tell
me
that
tale
!
<EOS>
It
be
twenty
-
four
year
ago
come
October
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
could
think
enough
on
a
man
as
have
ride
on

<EOS>
"
Yo

woman

"
say
Daniel
,
wink
at
the
specksioneer
.
  
<EOS>
and
Kinraid
immediately
look
at
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
premeditated
action
;
it
come
as
naturally
as
waken
in
the
morning
when
his
sleep
be
end
;
but
Sylvia
colour
as
red
as
any
rise
at
his
sudden
glance
,
 
colour
so
deeply
that
he
look
away
until
he
think
she
have
recover
her
composure
,
and
then
he
sit
gaze
at
her
again
.
<EOS>
but
not
for
long
,
for
Bell
suddenly
start
up
,
do
all
but
turn
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
late
,
she
say
,
and
her
master
be
tired
,
and
they
have
a
hard
day
before
them
next
day
;
and
it
be
keep
Ellen
Corney
up
;
and
they
have
have
enough
to
drink
,
 
more
than
be
good
for
them
,
she
be
sure
,
for
they
have
both
be
take
her
in
with
their
story
,
which
she
have
be
foolish
enough
to
believe
.
<EOS>
no
one
see
the
real
motive
of
all
this
almost
inhospitable
haste
to
dismiss
her
guest
,
how
the
sudden
fear
have
take
possession
of
her
that
he
and
Sylvia
be
"
fancy
each
other
"
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
have
say
early
in
the
evening
that
he
have
come
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
in
send
the
sausage
,
as
he
be
off
to
his
own
home
near
Newcastle
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
say
,
in
reply
to
Daniel
Robson
,
that
he
would
step
in
another
night
before
long
and
hear
some
more
of
the
old
man
's
yarn
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
have
just
have
enough
drink
to
make
him
very
good
-
tempered
,
or
else
<EOS>
his
wife
would
not
have
dare
to
have
act
as
she
do
;
and
this
maudlin
amiability
take
the
shape
of
hospitable
urgency
that
Kinraid
should
come
as
often
as
he
like
to
Haytersbank
;
come
and
make
it
his
home
when
he
be
in
these
part
;
stay
there
altogether
,
and
so
on
,
till
Bell
fairly
shut
the
outer
door
to
,
and
lock
it
before
the
specksioneer
have
well
get
out
of
the
shadow
of
their
roof
.
  
<EOS>
all
night
long
Sylvia
dream
of
burn
volcano
spring
out
of
icy
southern
sea
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
in
the
specksioneer
's
tale
the
flame
be
people
with
demon
,
there
be
no
human
interest
for
her
in
the
wondrous
scene
in
which
she
be
no
actor
,
only
a
spectator
.
<EOS>
with
daylight
come
wakening
and
little
homely
every
-
day
wonder
.
<EOS>
do
Kinraid
mean
that
he
be
go
away
really
and
entirely
,
or
do
he
not
?
<EOS>
be
he
Molly
Corney
's
sweetheart
,
or
be
he
not
?
<EOS>
when
she
have
argue
herself
into
certainty
on
one
side
,
she
suddenly
wheel
about
,
and
be
just
of
the
opposite
opinion
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
settle
that
it
could
not
be
settle
until
she
see
Molly
again
;
so
,
by
a
strong
gulping
effort
,
she
resolutely
determine
to
think
no
more
about
him
,
only
about
the
marvel
he
have
tell
.
<EOS>
She
may
think
a
little
about
them
when
she
sit
at
night
,
spin
in
silence
by
the
household
fire
,
or
when
she
go
out
in
the
gloaming
to
call
the
cattle
home
to
be
milk
,
and
saunter
back
behind
the
patient
,
slow
-
gaited
creature
;
and
at
time
on
future
summer
day
,
when
,
as
in
the
past
,
she
take
her
knit
out
for
the
sake
of
the
freshness
of
the
faint
sea
-
breeze
,
and
drop
down
from
ledge
to
ledge
of
the
rock
that
face
the
blue
ocean
,
establish
herself
in
a
perilous
nook
that
have
be
her
haunt
ever
since
her
parent
have
come
to
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
from
thence
she
have
often
see
the
distant
ship
pass
to
and
fro
,
with
a
certain
sort
of
lazy
pleasure
in
watch
their
swift
tranquillity
of
motion
,
but
no
thought
as
to
where
they
be
bind
to
,
or
what
strange
place
they
would
penetrate
to
before
they
turn
again
,
homeward
bind
.
    
<EOS>
a
REFRACTORY
pupil
  
Sylvia
be
still
full
of
the
specksioneer
and
his
story
,
when
Hepburn
come
up
to
give
her
the
next
lesson
.
<EOS>
but
the
prospect
of
a
little
sensible
commendation
for
write
a
whole
page
full
of
flourish
"
Abednegos
,
"
have
lose
all
the
slight
charm
it
have
ever
possess
.
<EOS>
She
be
much
more
inclined
to
try
and
elicit
some
sympathy
in
her
interest
in
the
peril
and
adventure
of
the
northern
seas
,
than
to
bend
and
control
her
mind
to
the
right
formation
of
letter
.
<EOS>
unwisely
enough
,
she
endeavour
to
repeat
one
of
the
narrative
that
she
have
hear
from
Kinraid
;
and
when
she
find
that
Hepburn
(
if
,
indeed
,
he
do
not
look
upon
the
whole
as
a
silly
invention
)
consider
it
only
as
an
interruption
to
the
real
business
in
hand
,
to
which
he
would
try
to
listen
as
patiently
as
he
could
,
in
the
hope
of
Sylvia
's
apply
herself
diligently
to
her
copy
-
book
when
she
have
clear
her
mind
,
she
contract
her
pretty
lip
,
as
if
to
check
them
from
make
any
further
appeal
for
sympathy
,
and
set
about
her
writing

lesson
in
a
very
rebellious
frame
of

only
restrain
by
her
mother

from

half
again

<EOS>
"
  
"
no

"
<EOS>
he
reply
,
smile
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
he
be
make
it
into
a
very
small
place
in
order
to
tease
her
;
so
she
pout
a
little
,
and
then
say
,
    
"
Greenland
be
all

I
want
to

<EOS>
except
,
perhaps
,
York

<EOS>
I
would
like

about

,
because
of
t

race
,
and
London
,
because
King
George
live
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
learn
geography
at
all
,
you
must
learn
about
all
place
:
which
of
them
be
hot
,
and
which
be
cold
,
and
how
many
inhabitant
be

what

I
be

Sylvie

if

"
  
<EOS>
this
seem
to
be
Sylvia
's
last
protest
against
learn
for
the
night
,
for
after
this
she
turn
docile
,
and
really
take
pain
to
understand
all
that
Philip
could
teach
her
,
by
mean
of
the
not
unskilful
,
though
rude
,
map
which
he
draw
for
her
with
a
piece
of
char
wood
on
his
aunt
's
dresser
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
his
aunt
's
leave
before
begin
what
Sylvia
call
his
"
dirty
work
;
"
but
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
even
she
become
a
little
interested
in
start
from
a
great
black
spot
call
Monkshaven
,
and
in
the
shaping
of
land
and
sea
around
that
one
centre
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
hold
her
round
chin
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
support
her
elbow
on
the
dresser
;
look
down
at
the
progress
of
the
rough
drawing
in
general
,
but
now
and
then
glance
up
at
him
with
sudden
inquiry
.
<EOS>
all
along
he
be
not
so
much
absorb
in
his
teaching
as
to
be
unconscious
of
her
sweet
proximity
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
her
good
mood
towards
him
;
neither
mutinous
nor
saucy
;
and
he
be
strive
with
all
his
might
to
retain
her
interest
,
speak
better
than
ever
he
have
do
before
(
such
brightness
do
love
call
forth
!
)
 
<EOS>
understand
what
she
would
care
to
hear
and
to
know
<EOS>
;
when
,
in
the
middle
of
an
attempt
at
explain
the
cause
of
the
long
polar
day
,
of
which
she
have
hear
from
her
childhood
,
he
feel
that
her
attention
be
no
longer
his
;
that
a
discord
have
come
in
between
their
mind
;
that
she
have
pass
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
this
certainty
of
intuition
last
but
for
an
instant
;
he
have
no
time
to
wonder
or
to
speculate
as
to
what
have
affect
her
so
adversely
to
his
wish
before
the
door
open
and
Kinraid
come
in
.
<EOS>
then
Hepburn
know
that
she
must
have
hear
his
come
footstep
,
and
recognize
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
angrily
stiffen
himself
up
into
coldness
of
demeanour
.
<EOS>
almost
to
his
surprise
,
Sylvia
's
greeting
to
the
new
comer
be
as
cold
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
She
stand
rather
behind
him
;
so
perhaps
she
do
not
see
the
hand
which
Kinraid
stretch
out
towards
her
,
for
she
do
not
place
her
own
little
palm
in
it
,
as
she
have
do
to
Philip
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
and
she
hardly
speak
,
but
begin
to
pore
over
the
rough
black
map
,
as
if
seize
with
strong
geographical
curiosity
,
or
determine
to
impress
Philip
's
lesson
deep
on
her
memory
.
  
<EOS>
still
Philip
be
dismay
by
see
the
warm
welcome
which
Kinraid
receive
from
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
come
in
from
the
back
premise
almost
at
the
same
time
as
the
specksioneer
enter
at
the
front
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
be
uneasy
,
too
,
at
find
Kinraid
take
his
seat
by
the
fireside
,
like
one
accustom
to
the
way
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
pipe
be
soon
produce
.
<EOS>
Philip
dislike
smoking
.
<EOS>
possibly
Kinraid
do
so
too
,
but
he
take
a
pipe
at
any
rate
,
and
light
it
,
though
he
hardly
use
it
at
all
,
but
keep
talk
to
farmer
Robson
on
sea
affair
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
conversation
pretty
much
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Philip
sit
gloomily
by
;
Sylvia
and
his
aunt
be
silent
,
and
old
Robson
smoke
his
long
clay
pipe
,
from
time
to
time
take
it
out
of
his
mouth
to
spit
into
the
bright
copper
spittoon
,
and
to
shake
the
white
ashe
out
of
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
before
he
replace
it
,
he
would
give
a
short
laugh
of
relish
interest
in
Kinraid
's
conversation
;
and
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
put
in
a
remark
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
perch
herself
sideways
on
the
end
of
the
dresser
,
and
make
pretence
to
sew
;
but
Philip
could
see
how
often
she
pause
in
her
work
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
his
aunt
speak
to
him
,
and
they
keep
up
a
little
side
conversation
,
more
because
Bell
Robson
feel
that
her
nephew
,
her
own
flesh
and
blood
,
be
put
out
,
than
for
any
special
interest
they
either
of
them
feel
in
what
they
be
say
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
also
,
they
neither
of
them
dislike
show
that
they
have
no
great
faith
in
the
story
Kinraid
be
tell
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
,
at
any
rate

<EOS>
Philip
be
sit
on
that
side
of
the
fire
which
be
near
to
the
window
and
to
Sylvia
,
and
opposite
to
the
specksioneer
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
turn
to
his
cousin
and
say
in
a
low
voice
    
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
can
not
go
on
with
our
spell
at
geography
till
that
fellow
's
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
colour
come
into
Sylvia
's
cheek
at
the
word
"
that
fellow
"
;
but
she
only
reply
with
a
careless
air
    
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
one
as
think
enough
be
as
good
as
a
feast
;
and
I
have
have
enough
of
geography
this
one
night
,
thank
you
kindly
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
take
refuge
in
offend
silence
.
<EOS>
He
be
maliciously
pleased
when
his
aunt
make
so
much
noise
with
her
preparation
for
supper
as
quite
to
prevent
the
sound
of
the
sailor
's
word
from
reach
Sylvia
's
ear
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
he
be
glad
to
perceive
that
her
effort
to
reach
the
remainder
of
the
story
be
baulk
!
<EOS>
this
nettle
her
,
and
,
determine
not
to
let
him
have
his
malicious
triumph
,
and
still
more
to
put
a
stop
to
any
attempt
at
private
conversation
,
she
begin
to
sing
to
herself
as
she
sit
at
her
work
;
till
,
suddenly
seize
with
a
desire
to
help
her
mother
,
she
dexterously
slip
down
from
her
seat
,
pass
Hepburn
,
and
be
on
her
knee
toast
cake
right
in
front
of
the
fire
,
and
just
close
to
her
father
and
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
noise
that
Hepburn
have
so
rejoice
in
prove
his
foe
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hear
the
little
merry
speech
that
dart
backwards
and
forwards
as
the
specksioneer
try
to
take
the
toasting
-
fork
out
of
Sylvia
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
come
that
sailor
chap
here
?
"
ask
Hepburn
of
his
aunt
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
none
fit
to
be
where
Sylvia
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
dunnot
know
,
"
say
she
;
"
the
Corneys
make
us
acquaint
first
,
and
my
master
be
quite
fain
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
like
him
,
too
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Hepburn
,
almost
wistfully
;
he
have
follow
Mrs.
Robson
into
the
dairy
on
pretence
of
help
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
none
fond
on
him
;
I
think
he
tell
us
traveller
's
tale
,
by
way
<EOS>
o
'
see
how
much
we
can
swallow
.
<EOS>
but
the
master
and
Sylvia
think
that
there
never
be
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
show
them
a
score
as
good
as
he
down
on
the
quayside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
laddie
,
keep
a
calm
sough
.
<EOS>
some
folk
like
some
folk
and
other
do
not
.
<EOS>
wherever
I
be
there
will
allays
be
a
welcome
for
thee
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
the
good
woman
think
that
he
have
be
hurt
by
the
evident
absorption
of
her
husband
and
daughter
with
their
new
friend
,
and
wish
to
make
all
easy
and
straight
.
<EOS>
but
do
what
she
would
,
he
do
not
recover
his
temper
all
evening
:
he
be
uncomfortable
,
put
out
,
not
enjoy
himself
,
and
yet
he
would
not
go
.
<EOS>
He
be
determined
to
assert
his
great
intimacy
in
that
house
by
outstay
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
latter
get
up
to
go
;
but
before
he
go
,
he
must
needs
bend
over
Sylvia
and
say
something
to
her
in
so
low
a
tone
that
Philip
could
not
hear
it
;
and
she
,
seize
with
a
sudden
fit
of
diligence
,
never
look
up
from
her
sewing
;
only
nod
her
head
by
way
of
reply
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
take
his
departure
,
after
many
a
little
delay
,
and
many
a
quick
return
,
which
to
the
suspicious
Philip
seem
only
pretence
for
take
steal
glance
at
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
decidedly
go
,
she
fold
up
her
work
,
and
declare
that
she
be
so
much
tired
that
she
must
go
to
bed
there
<EOS>
and
then
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
too
,
have
be
doze
for
the
last
half
-
hour
,
and
be
only
too
glad
to
see
sign
that
she
may
betake
herself
to
her
natural
place
of
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
another
glass
,
Philip
,
"
say
farmer
Robson
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hepburn
refuse
the
offer
rather
abruptly
.
<EOS>
He
draw
near
to
Sylvia
instead
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
make
her
speak
to
him
,
and
he
see
that
she
wish
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
He
take
up
the
readiest
pretext
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
unwise
one
as
it
prove
,
for
it
deprive
him
of
his
chance
of
occasionally
obtain
her
undivided
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
care
much
for
learn
geography
,
Sylvie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
much
to
-
night
,
"
say
she
,
make
a
pretence
to
yawn
,
yet
look
timidly
up
at
his
countenance
of
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
at
any
time
,
"
say
he
,
with
grow
anger
;
"
nor
for
any
kind
of
learning
.
<EOS>
I
do
bring
some
book
last
time
I
come
,
mean
to
teach
you
many
a
thing
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
will
just
trouble
you
for
my
book
;
I
put
them
on
yon
shelf
by
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
mind
that
she
should
bring
them
to
him
;
that
,
at
any
rate
,
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
them
out
of
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
do
not
reply
,
but
go
and
take
down
the
book
with
a
languid
,
indifferent
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
will
not
learn
any
more
geography
,
"
say
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
something
in
his
tone
strike
her
,
and
she
look
up
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
mark
of
stern
offence
upon
his
countenance
,
and
yet
in
it
there
be
also
an
air
of
wistful
regret
and
sadness
that
touch
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're
niver
angry
with
me
,
Philip
?
<EOS>
sooner
than
vex
yo
'
,
I
will
try
and
learn
.
<EOS>
only
,
I
be
just
stupid
;
and
it
mun
be
such
a
trouble
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
would
fain
have
snatch
at
this
half
proposal
that
the
lesson
should
be
continue
,
but
he
be
too
stubborn
and
proud
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
He
turn
away
from
the
sweet
,
plead
face
without
a
word
,
to
wrap
up
his
book
in
a
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
be
stand
quite
still
by
his
side
,
though
he
make
as
if
he
do
not
perceive
her
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
he
abruptly
wish
them
all
"
good
-
night
,
"
and
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
tear
in
Sylvia
's
eye
,
although
the
feeling
in
her
heart
be
rather
one
of
relief
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
a
fair
offer
,
and
it
have
be
treat
with
silent
contempt
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
afterwards
,
her
father
come
in
from
Monkshaven
market
,
and
drop
out
,
among
other
piece
of
news
,
that
he
have
meet
Kinraid
,
who
be
bind
for
his
own
home
at
cullercoat
.
<EOS>
He
have
desire
his
respect
to
Mrs.
Robson
and
her
daughter
;
and
have
bid
<EOS>
Robson
say
that
he
would
have
come
up
to
Haytersbank
to
wish
them
good
-
by
,
but
that
as
he
be
press
for
time
,
he
hope
they
would
excuse
him
.
<EOS>
but
Robson
do
not
think
it
worth
while
to
give
this
long
message
of
mere
politeness
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
it
do
not
relate
to
business
,
and
be
only
send
to
woman
,
Robson
forget
all
about
it
,
pretty
nearly
as
soon
as
it
be
utter
.
<EOS>
so
Sylvia
go
about
fret
herself
for
one
or
two
day
,
at
her
hero
's
apparent
carelessness
of
those
who
have
at
any
rate
treat
him
more
like
a
friend
than
an
acquaintance
of
only
a
few
week
'
standing
;
and
then
,
<EOS>
her
anger
quench
her
incipient
regard
<EOS>
,
she
go
about
her
daily
business
pretty
much
as
though
he
have
never
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
away
out
of
her
sight
into
the
thick
mist
of
unseen
life
from
which
he
have
emerge
 
go
away
without
a
word
,
and
she
may
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
but
still
there
be
a
chance
of
her
see
him
when
he
come
to
marry
Molly
Corney
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
should
be
bridesmaid
,
and
then
what
a
pleasant
merry
time
the
wedding
-
day
would
be
!
<EOS>
the
Corneys
be
all
such
kind
people
,
and
in
their
family
there
never
seem
to
be
the
check
and
restraint
by
which
her
own
mother
hedge
her
round
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
an
overwhelming
self
-
reproach
burst
of
love
for
that
"
own
mother
"
;
a
humiliation
before
her
slight
wish
,
as
penance
for
the
moment
's
unspoken
treason
;
and
thus
Sylvia
be
lead
to
request
her
cousin
Philip
to
resume
his
lesson
in
so
meek
a
manner
,
that
he
slowly
and
graciously
accede
to
a
request
which
he
be
yearn
to
fulfil
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
ensue
winter
,
all
go
on
in
monotonous
regularity
at
Haytersbank
Farm
for
many
week
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
come
and
go
,
and
think
Sylvia
wonderfully
improve
in
docility
and
sobriety
;
and
perhaps
also
he
notice
the
improvement
in
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
for
she
be
at
that
age
when
a
girl
change
rapidly
,
and
generally
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
shoot
up
into
a
tall
young
woman
;
her
eye
deepen
in
colour
,
her
face
increase
in
expression
,
and
a
sort
of
consciousness
of
unusual
good
look
give
her
a
slight
tinge
of
coquettish
shyness
with
the
few
stranger
whom
she
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Philip
hail
her
interest
in
geography
as
another
sign
of
improvement
.
<EOS>
He
have
bring
back
his
book
of
map
to
the
farm
;
and
there
he
sit
on
many
an
evening
teach
his
cousin
,
who
have
strange
fancy
respect
the
place
about
which
she
wish
to
learn
,
and
be
coolly
indifferent
to
the
very
existence
of
other
town
,
and
country
,
and
sea
far
more
famous
in
story
.
<EOS>
She
be
occasionally
wilful
,
and
at
time
very
contemptuous
as
to
the
superior
knowledge
of
her
instructor
;
but
,
in
spite
of
it
all
,
Philip
go
regularly
on
the
appoint
evening
to
Haytersbank
 
through
keen
black
east
wind
,
or
drive
snow
,
or
slush
thaw
;
for
he
like
dearly
to
sit
a
little
behind
her
,
with
his
arm
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
she
stoop
over
the
outspread
map
,
with
her
eye
<EOS>
,
 
could
he
have
see
them
,
 
a
good
deal
fix
on
one
spot
in
the
map
,
not
Northumberland
,
where
Kinraid
be
spend
the
winter
,
but
those
wild
northern
sea
about
which
he
have
tell
them
such
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
towards
spring
,
she
see
Molly
Corney
come
towards
the
farm
.
<EOS>
the
companion
have
not
meet
for
many
week
,
for
Molly
have
be
from
home
visit
her
relation
in
the
north
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
open
the
door
,
and
stand
smile
and
shiver
on
the
threshold
,
glad
to
see
her
friend
again
.
<EOS>
Molly
call
out
,
when
a
few
pace
off
,
    
"
why
,
Sylvia
,
be
that
thee
!
<EOS>
why
,
how
thou'rt
grow
,
to
be
sure

<EOS>
what
a
bonny
lass
thou

"
  
<EOS>
"
Dunnot
talk
nonsense
to
my
lass
,
"
say
Bell
Robson
,
hospitably
leave
her
iron
and
come
to
the
door
;
but
though
the
mother
try
to
look
as
if
she
think
it
nonsense
,
she
could
hardly
keep
down
the
smile
that
shine
out
of
her
eye
,
as
she
put
her
hand
on
Sylvia
's
shoulder
,
with
a
fond
sense
of
proprietorship
in
what
be
be
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
"
be
quiet
wi

thee

"
say
Sylvia
,
more
than
half
offended
,
and
turn
away
in
a
huff
at
the
open
bareface
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
;

they
will
,

"
<EOS>
yo'll
not

Thy

Mrs.

,
with
severe
sadness
;
for
now
Molly

to
talk
as

<EOS>
but
Molly
's
purpose
be
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
her

of
which
she
be
very
full

rare

a
candid
,
sad
acknowledgement
in
her
heart
that
it
be
no
wonder
that
Sylvia
be
so
much
admired
and
love
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
Hester
have
see
her
sit
near
her
mother
in
the
market
-
place
;
there
be
a
basket
by
her
,
and
over
the
clean
cloth
that
cover
the
yellow
pound
of
butter
,
she
have
lay
the
hedge
-
rose
and
honeysuckle
she
have
gather
on
the
way
into
Monkshaven
;
her
straw
hat
be
on
her
knee
,
and
she
be
busy
place
some
of
the
flower
in
the
ribbon
that
go
round
it
.
<EOS>
then
she
hold
it
on
her
hand
,
and
turn
it
round
about
,
put
her
head
on
one
side
,
the
well
to
view
the
effect
;
and
all
this
time
,
Hester
,
peep
at
her
through
the
fold
of
the
stuff
display
in
Foster
's
window
,
see
her
with
admire
,
wistful
eye
;
wonder
,
too
,
if
Philip
,
at
the
other
counter
,
be
aware
of
his
cousin
's
be
there
,
so
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
then
Sylvia
put
on
her
hat
,
and
,
look
up
at
Foster
's
window
,
catch
Hester
's
face
of
interest
,
and
smile
and
blush
at
the
consciousness
of
have
be
watch
over
her
little
vanity
,
and
Hester
smile
back
,
but
rather
sadly
.
<EOS>
then
a
customer
come
in
,
and
she
have
to
attend
to
her
business
,
which
,
on
this
as
on
all
market
day
,
be
great
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
she
be
aware
of
Philip
rush
bare
-
head
out
of
the
shop
,
eager
and
delighted
at
something
he
see
outside
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
looking
-
glass
hang
against
the
wall
on
Hester
's
side
,
place
in
that
retire
corner
,
in
order
that
the
good
woman
who
come
to
purchase
head
-
gear
of
any
kind
may
see
the
effect
thereof
before
they
conclude
their
bargain
.
<EOS>
in
a
pause
of
custom
,
Hester
,
half
-
ashamed
,
steal
into
this
corner
,
and
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
what
do
she
see
?
<EOS>
a
colourless
face
,
dark
soft
hair
with
no
light
gleam
in
it
,
eye
that
be
melancholy
instead
of
smile
,
a
mouth
compress
with
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
she
have
to
compare
with
the
bright
bonny
face
in
the
sunlight
outside
.
<EOS>
She
give
a
gulp
to
check
the
sigh
that
be
rise
,
and
come
back
,
even
more
patient
than
she
have
be
before
this
dishearten
peep
,
to
serve
all
the
whim
and
fancy
of
purchaser
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
herself
have
be
rather
put
out
by
Philip
's
way
of
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
make
her
look
so
silly
,
"
she
think
;
and
"
what
for
must
he
make
a
sight
of
himself
,
come
among
the
market
folk
in
that
-
a
-
way
"
;
and
when
he
take
to
admire
her
hat
,
she
pull
out
the
flower
in
a
pet
,
and
throw
them
down
,
and
trample
them
under
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
for
art
thou
do
that
,
Sylvie
?
"
say
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
flower
be
well
enough
,
though
may
-
be

may
ha

be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
Philip
to
speak
to
me
so
,
"
say
Sylvia
,
pout
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
?
"
ask
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
could
not
repeat
his
word
.
<EOS>
She
hang
her
head
,
and
look
red
and
pre
-
occupy
,
anything
but
pleased
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
address
his
first
expression
of
personal
admiration
at
an
unfortunate
tune
.
  
<EOS>
It
just
show
what
different
view
different
man
and
woman
take
of
their
fellow
-
creature
,
when
I
say
that
Hester
look
upon
Philip
as
the
good
and
most
agreeable
man
she
have
ever
know
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
one
to
speak
of
himself
without
be
question
on
the
subject
,
so
his
Haytersbank
relation
,
only
come
into
the
neighborhood
in
the
last
year
or
two
,
know
nothing
of
the
trial
he
have
surmount
,
or
the
difficult
duty
he
have
perform
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
,
indeed
,
have
strong
faith
in
him
,
both
from
partial
knowledge
of
his
character
,
and
because
he
be
of
her
own
tribe
and
kin
;
but
she
have
never
learn
the
small
detail
of
his
past
life
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
respect
him
as
her
mother
's
friend
,
and
treat
him
tolerably
well
as
long
as
he
preserve
his
usual
self
-
restraint
of
demeanour
,
but
hardly
ever
think
of
him
when
he
be
absent
.
  
<EOS>
now
Hester
,
who
have
watch
him
daily
for
all
the
year
since
he
have
first
come
as
an
errand
-
boy
into
Foster
's
shop
 
watch
with
quiet
,
modest
,
yet
observant
eye
 
have
see
how
devoted
he
be
to
his
master
's
interest
,
have
know
of
his
careful
and
punctual
ministration
to
his
absent
mother
's
comfort
,
as
long
as
she
be
live
to
benefit
by
his
silent
,
frugal
self
-
denial
.
  
<EOS>
His
methodical
appropriation
of
the
few
hour
<EOS>
he
could
call
his
own
<EOS>
be
not
without
its
charm
to
the
equally
methodical
Hester
;
the
way
in
which
he
reproduce
any
lately
acquire
piece
of
knowledge
 
knowledge
so
wearisome
to
Sylvia
 
be
delightfully
instructive
to
Hester
 
<EOS>
although
,
as
she
be
habitually
silent
,
it
would
have
require
an
observer
more
interested
in
discover
her
feeling
than
Philip
be
to
have
perceive
the
little
flush
on
the
pale
cheek
,
and
the
brightness
in
the
half
-
veiled
eye
whenever
he
be
talk
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
think
of
love
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
love
be
a
vanity
,
a
worldliness
not
to
be
speak
about
,
or
even
think
about
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
before
the
Robsons
come
into
the
neighbourhood
,
an
idea
have
cross
her
mind
that
possibly
the
quiet
,
habitual
way
in
which
she
and
Philip
live
together
,
may
drift
them
into
matrimony
at
some
distant
period
;
and
she
could
not
bear
the
humble
advance
which
Coulson
,
Philip
's
fellow
-
lodger
,
sometimes
make
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
disgust
her
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
the
robson
settle
at
Haytersbank
,
Philip
's
evening
be
so
often
spend
there
that
any
unconscious
hope
Hester
might
,
unaware
,
have
entertain
,
die
away
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
have
feel
a
pang
akin
to
jealousy
when
she
hear
of
Sylvia
,
the
little
cousin
,
who
be
pass
out
of
childhood
into
womanhood
.
<EOS>
once
 
early
in
those
day
 
she
have
venture
to
ask
Philip
what
Sylvia
be
like
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
not
warm
up
at
the
question
,
and
have
give
rather
a
dry
catalogue
of
her
feature
,
hair
,
and
height
,
but
<EOS>
Hester
,
almost
to
her
own
surprise
,
persevere
,
and
jerk
out
the
final
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
sallow
cheek
grow
deep
by
two
or
three
shade
;
but
he
answer
with
a
tone
of
indifference
,
    
"
I
believe
some
folk
think
her
so
.
"
  
"
but
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
persevere
Hester
,
in
spite
of
her
be
aware
that
he
somehow
dislike
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
need
for
talk
o
'
<EOS>
such
thing
,
"
he
answer
,
with
abrupt
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
silence
her
curiosity
from
that
time
.
<EOS>
but
her
heart
be
not
quite
at
ease
,
and
she
keep
on
wonder
whether
Philip
think
his
little
cousin
pretty
until
she
see
her
and
him
together
,
on
that
occasion
of
which
we
have
speak
,
when
Sylvia
come
to
the
shop
to
buy
her
new
cloak
;
and
after
that
Hester
never
wonder
whether
Philip
think
his
cousin
pretty
or
no
,
for
she
know
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Bell
Robson
have
her
own
anxiety
on
the
subject
of
her
daughter
's
increase
attraction
.
<EOS>
She
apprehend
the
danger
consequent
upon
certain
fact
,
by
a
mental
process
more
akin
to
intuition
than
reason
.
<EOS>
She
be
uncomfortable
,
even
while
her
motherly
vanity
be
flatter
,
at
the
admiration
Sylvia
receive
from
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
this
admiration
be
make
evident
to
her
mother
in
many
way
.
<EOS>
when
Sylvia
be
with
her
at
market
,
it
may
have
be
think
that
the
doctor
have
prescribe
a
diet
of
butter
and
egg
to
all
the
man
under
forty
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
at
first
it
seem
to
Mrs.
Robson
but
a
natural
tribute
to
the
superior
merit
of
her
farm
produce
;
but
by
degree
she
perceive
that
if
Sylvia
remain
at
home
,
she
stand
no
well
chance
than
her
neighbour
of
an
early
sale
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
customer
than
formerly
for
the
fleece
store
in
the
wool
-
loft
;
comely
young
butcher
come
after
the
calf
almost
before
it
have
be
decide
to
sell
it
;
in
short
,
excuse
be
seldom
want
to
those
who
wish
to
see
the
beauty
of
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
all
this
make
Bell
uncomfortable
,
though
she
could
hardly
have
tell
what
she
dread
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
herself
seem
unspoilt
by
it
as
far
as
her
home
relation
be
concern
.
<EOS>
a
little
thoughtless
she
have
always
be
,
and
thoughtless
she
be
still
;
but
,
as
her
mother
have
often
say
,
"
Yo
'
canna
put
old
head
on
young

;
"
and
if
blame
for
her
carelessness
by
her
parent
,
Sylvia
be
always
as
penitent
as
she
could
be
for
the
time
be
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
be
only
to
her
father
and
mother
that
she
remain
the
same
as
she
have
be
when
an
awkward
lassie
of
thirteen
.
<EOS>
out
of
the
house
there
be
the
most
contradictory
opinion
of
her
,
especially
if
the
voice
of
woman
be
to
be
listen
to
.
<EOS>
She
be
"
an
ill
-
favour
,
overgrow
thing
"
;
"
just
as
bonny
as
the
first
rise
<EOS>
i
'
June
,
and
<EOS>
as
sweet
<EOS>
i
'
her
nature
as
t
'
honeysuckle
<EOS>
a
-
climbing
round
it
<EOS>
;
"
she
be
"
a
vixen
,
with
a
tongue
sharp
enough
to
make
yer
very
heart
bleed
;
"
she
be
"
just
a
bit
o
'
sunshine
<EOS>
wheriver
<EOS>
she
go
;
"
she
be
sulky
,
lively
,
witty
,
silent
,
affectionate
,
or
cold
-
hearted
,
accord
to
the
person
who
speak
about
her
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
her
peculiarity
seem
to
be
this
 
that
every
one
who
know
her
talk
about
her
either
in
praise
or
blame
;
in
church
,
or
in
market
,
she
unconsciously
attract
attention
;
they
could
not
forget
her
presence
,
as
they
could
that
of
other
girl
perhaps
more
personally
attractive
.
<EOS>
now
all
this
be
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
her
mother
,
who
begin
to
feel
as
if
she
would
rather
have
have
her
child
pass
by
in
silence
than
so
much
notice
.
<EOS>
Bell
's
opinion
be
,
that
it
be
creditable
to
a
woman
to
go
through
life
in
the
shadow
of
obscurity
,
 
never
name
except
in
connexion
with
good
housewifery
,
husband
,
or
child
.
<EOS>
too
much
talk
about
a
girl
,
even
in
the
way
of
praise
,
disturb
Mrs.
Robson
's
opinion
of
her
;
and
when
her
neighbour
tell
her
how
her
own
daughter
be
admire
,
she
would
reply
coldly
,
"
She
be
just
well
enough
,
"
and
change
the
subject
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
quite
different
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
to
his
loose
,
less
-
restrained
mind
,
it
be
agreeable
to
hear
of
,
and
still
more
to
see
,
the
attention
which
his
daughter
's
beauty
receive
.
<EOS>
He
feel
it
as
reflect
consequence
on
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
trouble
his
mind
with
speculation
as
to
whether
he
himself
be
popular
,
still
less
whether
he
be
respect
.
<EOS>
He
be
pretty
welcome
wherever
he
go
,
as
a
jovial
good
-
natured
man
,
who
have
do
adventurous
and
illegal
thing
in
his
youth
,
which
in
some
measure
entitle
him
to
speak
out
his
opinion
on
life
in
general
in
the
authoritative
manner
he
generally
use
;
but
,
of
the
two
,
he
prefer
consort
with
young
man
,
to
take
a
sober
stand
of
respectability
with
the
elder
of
the
place
;
and
he
perceive
,
without
reason
upon
it
,
that
the
gay
daring
spirit
be
more
desirous
of
his
company
when
Sylvia
be
by
his
side
than
at
any
other
time
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
these
would
saunter
up
to
Haytersbank
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
lounge
round
his
field
with
the
old
farmer
.
<EOS>
Bell
keep
herself
from
the
nap
which
have
be
her
weekly
solace
for
year
,
in
order
to
look
after
Sylvia
,
and
on
such
occasion
she
always
turn
as
cold
a
shoulder
to
the
visitor
as
her
sense
of
hospitality
and
of
duty
to
her
husband
would
permit
.
<EOS>
but
if
they
do
not
enter
the
house
,
old
Robson
would
always
have
Sylvia
with
him
when
he
go
the
round
of
his
land
.
<EOS>
Bell
could
see
them
from
the
upper
window
:
<EOS>
the
young
man
stand
in
the
attitude
of
listener
,
while
Daniel
lay
down
the
law
on
some
point
,
enforce
his
word
by
pantomimic
action
with
his
thick
stick
;
and
Sylvia
,
half
turn
away
as
if
from
some
too
admire
gaze
,
be
possibly
pick
flower
out
of
the
hedge
-
bank
.
<EOS>
these
Sunday
afternoon
stroll
be
the
plague
of
Bell
's
life
that
whole
summer
.
<EOS>
then
it
take
as
much
of
artifice
as
be
in
the
simple
woman
's
nature
to
keep
Daniel
from
insist
on
have
Sylvia
's
company
every
time
he
go
down
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
again
,
come
a
perplexity
,
the
acknowledgement
of
which
in
distinct
thought
would
have
be
an
act
of
disloyalty
,
accord
to
Bell
's
conscience
.
<EOS>
if
Sylvia
go
with
her
father
,
he
never
drink
to
excess
;
and
that
be
a
good
gain
to
health
at
any
rate
<EOS>
(
drinking
be
hardly
a
sin
against
moral
in
those
day
,
and
in
that
place
)
;
so
,
occasionally
,
she
be
allow
to
accompany
him
to
Monkshaven
as
a
check
upon
his
folly
;
for
he
be
too
fond
and
proud
of
his
daughter
to
disgrace
her
by
any
open
excess
.
<EOS>
but
one
Sunday
afternoon
early
in
November
,
Philip
come
up
before
the
time
at
which
he
usually
pay
his
visit
.
<EOS>
He
look
grave
and
pale
;
and
his
aunt
begin
,
    
"

<EOS>
Thou'rt

Philip

make

he

He
himself
have
be
annoy
more
at
the
idea
that

out

door

well

itself

he

He
stand
watch
his

<EOS>
at
last
she
heave
a

stir
the
fire

as

by

<EOS>
She
really
believe
her

to
have
the
serious
and
important
occupation
for
his
mind
that
she
have
be
teach
to
consider
befit
the
superior
intellect

the
masculine
gender

she
would
have
tax
herself
severely
,
if
,
even
in
thought
,
she
have
blame
him

and
Philip
respect
her
feeling
too
much
to
say
that
Sylvia

father
ought
to
look
after
her
more
closely
if
he
make
such
a
pretty

constantly

some
such
speech

again

have
to

down
certain

the
wool
of
which

and
the
web
of
which

her
mother
's
careful
hand
;
then
the
full
brown
stuff
petticoat
,
the
arm
hold
the
petticoat
back
in
decent
fold
,
so
as
not
to
encumber
the
descend
foot
;
the
slender
neck
and
shoulder
hide
under
the
fold
square
of
fresh
white
muslin
;
the
crowning
beauty
of
the
soft
innocent
face
radiant
in
colour
,
and
with
the
light
brown
curl
cluster
around
.
<EOS>
She
make
her
way
quickly
to
Philip
's
side
;
how
his
heart
beat
at
her
approach
!
<EOS>
and
even
more
when
she
enter
into
a
low
-
voiced
_
tete
-
a
-
tete

.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
he
go
yet
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
abide
him
;
I
could
ha
'
pinched
father
when
he
ask
him
for
t
'
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
maybe
,
he
will
not
stay
long
,
"
say
Philip
,
hardly
understand
the
meaning
of
what
he
say
,
so
sweet
be
it
to
have
her
make
her
whisper
confidence
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
Simpson
be
not
go
to
let
her
alone
in
the
dark
corner
between
the
door
and
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
begin
pay
her
some
coarse
country
compliment
 
too
strong
in
their
direct
flattery
for
even
her
father
's
taste
,
more
especially
as
he
see
by
his
wife
's
set
lip
and
frown
brow
how
much
she
disapprove
of
their
visitor
's
style
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
measter
,
leave
t
'
lass
alone
;
she
be
set
up
enough
a'ready

Yo

"
  
<EOS>
and
in
this
way
the
old
farmer
and
the
bluff
butcher
chat
on
about
horse
,
while
Philip
and
Sylvia
sate
together
,
he
turn
over
all
manner
of
hope
and
project
for
the
future
,
in
spite
of
his
aunt
's
opinion
that
he
be
too
"
old
-
fashioned
"
for
her
dainty
,
bloom
daughter
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
too
,
Mrs.
Robson
see
some
reason
for
change
her
mind
on
this
head
as
she
watch
Sylvia
this
night
,
for
she
accompany
Philip
to
the
door
,
when
the
time
come
for
him
to
start
homeward
,
and
bade
him
"
good

night
"
with
unusual
fervour
,
add
    
"
Thou'st
be
a

I
could
welly
think
thou
art
to
be

<EOS>
anyways
,
I
trust
to
thee
to
look
after
the
lile
lass
,
as
have
no
brother
to
guide
her
among
man
 
and
man
's
very
kittle
for
a
woman
to
deal
wi
;

thou'lt
have
an
eye

,
my
mind
will
be
easy

"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
beat
fast
,
but
his
voice
be
as
calm
as
usual
when
he
reply
    
<EOS>
"
I
would
just
keep
her
a
bit
aloof
from
Monkshaven
folk
;
a
lass
be
always
the
more
thought
on
for
be
chary
of
herself
;
and
as
for
t
'
rest
,
I
will
have
an
eye
to
the
folk
she
go
among
,
and
if
I
see
that
they
do
not
befit
her
,
I
will
just
give
her
a
warning
,
for
she
be
not
one
to
like
such
chap
as
yon
Simpson
there
;
she
can
see
what
be
become
in
a
man
to
say
to
a
lass
,
and
what
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
set
out
on
his
two
-
mile
walk
home
with
a
tumult
of
happiness
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
often
carry
away
by
delusion
of
his
own
creating
;
to
-
night
he
think
he
have
good
ground
for
believe
that
by
patient
self
-
restraint
he
may
win
Sylvia
's
love
.
<EOS>
a
year
ago
he
have
nearly
earn
her
dislike
by
obtrude
upon
her
look
and
<EOS>
word
betoken
his
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
He
alarm
her
girlish
coyness
,
as
well
as
weary
her
with
the
wish
he
have
then
feel
that
she
should
take
an
interest
in
his
pursuit
.
<EOS>
but
,
with
unusual
wisdom
,
he
have
perceive
his
mistake
;
it
be
many
month
now
since
he
have
betray
,
by
word
or
look
,
that
she
be
anything
more
to
him
than
a
little
cousin
to
be
care
for
and
protect
when
need
be
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
that
she
have
become
tamed
,
just
as
a
wild
animal
be
tame
;
he
have
remain
tranquil
and
impassive
,
almost
as
if
he
do
not
perceive
her
shy
advance
towards
friendliness
.
<EOS>
these
advance
be
make
by
her
after
the
lesson
have
cease
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
lest
he
be
displeased
with
her
behaviour
in
reject
his
instruction
,
and
be
not
easy
till
she
be
at
peace
with
him
;
and
now
,
to
all
appearance
,
he
and
she
be
perfect
friend
,
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
in
his
absence
she
would
not
allow
her
young
companion
to
laugh
at
his
grave
sobriety
of
character
,
and
somewhat
prim
demeanour
;
she
would
even
go
against
her
conscience
,
and
deny
that
she
perceive
any
peculiarity
.
<EOS>
when
she
want
it
,
she
seek
his
advice
on
such
small
subject
as
come
up
in
her
daily
life
;
and
she
try
not
to
show
sign
of
weariness
when
he
use
more
word
 
and
more
difficult
word
 
than
be
necessary
to
convey
his
idea
.
<EOS>
but
her
ideal
husband
be
different
from
Philip
in
every
point
,
the
two
image
never
for
an
instant
merge
into
one
.
<EOS>
to
Philip
she
be
the
only
woman
in
the
world
;
it
be
the
one
subject
on
which
he
dare
not
consider
,
for
fear
that
both
conscience
and
judgment
should
decide
against
him
,
and
that
he
should
be
convince
against
his
will
that
she
be
an
unfit
mate
for
him
,
that
she
never
would
be
his
,
and
that
it
be
waste
of
time
and
life
to
keep
her
shrine
in
the
dear
sanctuary
of
his
being
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
serious
and
religious
aim
which
,
in
any
other
case
,
he
would
have
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
as
the
object
he
ought
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
for
he
have
be
bring
up
among
the
Quakers
,
and
share
in
their
austere
distrust
of
a
self
-
seek
spirit
;
yet
what
else
but
self
-
seek
be
his
passionate
prayer
,
"
<EOS>
give
me
Sylvia
,
or
else
,
I
die
?
"
<EOS>
no
other
vision
have
ever
cross
his
masculine
fancy
for
a
moment
;
his
be
a
rare
and
constant
love
that
deserve
a
well
fate
than
it
meet
with
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
his
hope
be
high
,
as
I
have
say
,
not
merely
as
to
the
growth
of
Sylvia
's
feeling
towards
him
,
but
as
to
the
probability
of
his
soon
be
in
a
position
to
place
her
in
such
comfort
,
as
his
wife
,
as
she
have
never
enjoy
before
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
brother
Foster
be
think
of
retire
from
business
,
and
relinquish
the
shop
to
their
two
shopman
,
Philip
Hepburn
and
William
Coulson
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
be
only
by
look
back
for
a
few
month
,
and
notice
chance
expression
and
small
indication
,
that
this
intention
of
theirs
could
be
discover
.
<EOS>
but
every
step
they
take
tend
this
way
,
and
Philip
know
their
usual
practice
of
deliberation
too
well
to
feel
in
the
least
impatient
for
the
quick
progress
of
the
end
which
he
see
steadily
approach
.
<EOS>
the
whole
atmosphere
of
life
among
the
Friends
at
this
date
partook
of
this
character
of
self
-
repression
,
and
both
Coulson
and
Hepburn
share
in
it
.
<EOS>
Coulson
be
just
as
much
aware
of
the
prospect
open
before
him
as
Hepburn
;
but
they
never
speak
together
on
the
subject
,
although
their
mutual
knowledge
may
be
occasionally
imply
in
their
conversation
on
their
future
life
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
foster
be
impart
more
of
the
background
of
their
business
to
their
successor
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
at
least
,
the
brother
mean
to
retain
an
interest
in
the
shop
,
even
after
they
have
give
up
the
active
management
;
and
they
sometimes
think
of
set
up
a
separate
establishment
as
banker
.
<EOS>
the
separation
of
the
business
,
 
the
introduction
of
their
shopman
to
the
distant
manufacturer
who
furnish
their
good
(
in
those
day
the
system
of
"
traveller
"
be
not
so
widely
organize
as
it
be
at
present
)
,
 
all
these
step
be
in
gradual
progress
;
and
already
Philip
see
himself
in
imagination
in
the
dignified
position
of
joint
master
of
the
principal
shop
in
Monkshaven
,
with
Sylvia
instal
as
his
wife
,
with
certainly
a
silk
gown
,
and
possibly
a
gig
at
her
disposal
.
<EOS>
in
all
Philip
's
vision
of
future
prosperity
,
it
be
Sylvia
who
be
to
be
aggrandize
by
them
;
his
own
life
be
to
be
spend
as
it
be
now
,
pretty
much
between
the
four
shop
wall
.
    
<EOS>
NEW
YEAR
's
FETE
  
<EOS>
all
this
enlargement
of
interest
in
the
shop
occupy
Philip
fully
for
some
month
after
the
period
refer
to
in
the
precede
chapter
.
<EOS>
remember
his
last
conversation
with
his
aunt
,
he
may
have
be
uneasy
at
his
inability
to
perform
his
promise
and
look
after
his
pretty
cousin
,
but
that
about
the
middle
of
November
Bell
Robson
have
fall
ill
of
a
rheumatic
fever
,
and
that
her
daughter
have
be
entirely
absorb
in
nurse
her
.
<EOS>
no
thought
of
company
or
gaiety
be
in
Sylvia
's
mind
as
long
as
her
mother
's
illness
last
;
vehement
in
all
her
feeling
,
she
discover
in
the
dread
of
lose
her
mother
how
passionately
she
be
attach
to
her
.
<EOS>
hitherto
<EOS>
she
have
suppose
,
as
child
so
often
do
,
that
her
parent
would
live
for
ever
;
and
now
when
it
be
a
question
of
day
,
whether
by
that
time
the
follow
week
her
mother
may
not
be
bury
out
of
her
sight
for
ever
,
she
cling
to
every
semblance
of
service
to
be
render
,
or
affection
show
,
as
if
she
hope
to
condense
the
love
and
care
of
year
into
the
few
day
only
that
may
remain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
linger
on
,
begin
slowly
to
recover
,
and
before
Christmas
be
again
sit
by
the
fireside
in
the
house
-
place
,
wan
and
pull
down
,
muffle
up
with
shawl
and
blanket
,
but
still
there
once
more
,
where
not
long
before
Sylvia
have
scarcely
expect
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
come
up
that
evening
and
find
Sylvia
in
wild
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
everything
be
do
,
now
that
her
mother
have
once
come
downstairs
again
;
she
laugh
with
glee
;
she
kiss
her
mother
;
she
shake
hand
with
Philip
,
she
almost
submit
to
a
speech
of
more
than
usual
tenderness
from
him
;
but
,
in
the
midst
of
his
word
,
her
mother
's
pillow
want
arrange
<EOS>
and
she
go
to
her
chair
,
pay
no
more
heed
to
his
word
than
if
they
have
be
address
to
the
cat
,
that
lie
on
the
invalid
's
knee
be
purr
out
her
welcome
to
the
weak
hand
feebly
stroke
her
back
.
<EOS>
Robson
himself
soon
come
in
,
look
old
and
more
subdued
since
Philip
have
see
him
last
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
urgent
that
his
wife
should
have
some
spirit
and
water
;
but
on
her
refusal
,
almost
as
if
she
loathe
the
thought
of
the
smell
,
he
content
himself
with
share
her
tea
,
though
he
keep
abuse
the
beverage
as
"
wash
the
heart
out
of
a
man
,
"
and
attribute
all
the
degeneracy
of
the
world
,
grow
up
about
him
in
his
old
age
,
to
the
drinking
of
such
slop
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
his
little
self
-
sacrifice
put
him
in
an
unusually
good
temper
;
and
,
mingle
with
his
real
gladness
at
have
his
wife
once
more
on
the
way
to
recovery
,
bring
back
some
of
the
old
charm
of
tenderness
combine
with
light
-
heartedness
,
which
have
win
the
sober
Isabella
Preston
long
ago
.
<EOS>
He
sit
by
her
side
,
hold
her
hand
,
and
talk
of
old
time
to
the
young
couple
opposite
;
of
his
adventure
and
escape
,
and
how
he
have
win
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
,
faintly
smile
at
the
remembrance
of
those
day
,
yet
half
-
ashamed
at
have
the
little
detail
of
her
courtship

from

to

<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
his
half
-
promise
,
nay
against
his
natural
inclination
,
Philip
be
lure
to
the
Corneys
'
by
the
thought
of
meet
Sylvia
,
of
watch
her
and
exult
in
her
superiority
in
pretty
look
and
way
to
all
the
other
girl
likely
to
be
assemble
.
<EOS>
besides
(
he
tell
his
conscience
)
<EOS>
he
be
pledge
to
his
aunt
to
watch
over
Sylvia
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
so
in
the
interval
before
New
Year
's
Eve
,
he
silently
revel
as
much
as
any
young
girl
in
the
anticipation
of
the
happy
coming
time
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
hour
,
all
the
actor
in
this
story
have
play
out
their
part
and
go
to
their
rest
,
there
be
something
touching
in
record
the
futile
effort
make
by
Philip
to
win
from
Sylvia
the
love
he
yearn
for
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
the
time
,
any
one
who
have
watch
him
may
have
be
amuse
to
see
the
grave
,
awkward
,
plain
young
man
study
pattern
and
colour
for
a
new
waistcoat
,
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
,
after
the
meditative
manner
common
to
those
who
be
choose
a
new
article
of
dress
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
smile
could
they
have
read
in
his
imagination
the
frequent
rehearsal
of
the
come
evening
,
when
he
and
she
should
each
be
dress
in
their
gala
attire
,
to
spend
a
few
hour
under
a
bright
,
festive
aspect
,
among
people
whose
company
would
oblige
them
to
assume
a
new
demeanour
towards
each
other
,
not
so
familiar
as
their
every
-
day
manner
,
but
allow
more
scope
for
the
expression
of
rustic
gallantry
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
so
seldom
be
to
anything
of
the
kind
,
that
,
even
have
Sylvia
not
be
go
,
he
would
have
feel
a
kind
of
shy
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
anything
so
unusual
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
if
Sylvia
have
not
be
go
,
it
be
very
probable
that
Philip
's
rigid
conscience
may
have
be
arouse
to
the
question
whether
such
party
do
not
savour
too
much
of
the
world
for
him
to
form
one
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
however
,
the
fact
to
him
be
simply
these
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
and
she
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
day
before
,
he
have
hurry
off
to
Haytersbank
Farm
with
a
small
paper
parcel
in
his
pocket
 
a
ribbon
with
a
little
briar
-
rise
pattern
run
upon
it
for
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
thing
he
have
ever
venture
to
give
her
 
the
first
thing
of
the
kind
<EOS>
would
,
perhaps
,
be
more
accurate
;
for
when
he
have
first
begin
to
teach
her
any
lesson
,
he
have
give
her
Mavor
's
spelling
-
book
,
but
that
he
may
have
do
,
out
of
zeal
for
knowledge
,
to
any
dunce
of
a
little
girl
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
this
ribbon
be
quite
a
different
kind
of
present
;
he
touch
it
tenderly
,
as
if
he
be
caress
it
,
when
he
think
of
her
wear
it
;
the
briar
-
rose
(
sweetness
and
thorn
)
seem
to
be
the
very
flower
for
her
;
the
soft
,
green
ground
on
which
the
pink
and
brown
pattern
run
,
be
just
the
colour
to
show
off
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
in
a
way
belong
to
him
:
her
cousin
,
her
mentor
,
her
chaperon
,
her
lover
!
<EOS>
while
other
only
admire
,
he
may
hope
to
appropriate
;
for
of
late
they
have
be
such
happy
friend
!
<EOS>
Her
mother
approve
of
him
,
her
father
like
him
.
<EOS>
a
few
month
,
perhaps
only
a
few
week
more
of
self
-
restraint
,
<EOS>
and
then
he
may
go
and
speak
openly
of
his
wish
,
and
what
he
have
to
offer
.
<EOS>
for
he
have
resolve
,
with
the
quiet
force
of
his
character
,
to
wait
until
all
be
finally
settle
between
him
and
his
master
,
before
he
declare
himself
to
either
Sylvia
or
her
parent
.
<EOS>
the
interval
be
spend
in
patient
,
silent
endeavour
to
recommend
himself
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
to
give
his
ribbon
to
his
aunt
in
charge
for
Sylvia
,
and
that
be
a
disappointment
to
his
fancy
,
although
he
try
to
reason
himself
into
think
that
it
be
better
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
time
to
wait
for
her
return
from
some
errand
on
which
she
have
go
,
for
he
be
daily
more
and
more
occupied
with
the
affair
of
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
make
many
a
promise
to
her
mother
,
and
more
to
herself
,
that
she
would
not
stay
late
at
the
party
,
but
she
may
go
as
early
as
she
like
;
and
before
the
December
daylight
have
fade
away
,
Sylvia
present
herself
at
the
Corneys
'
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
come
early
in
order
to
help
to
set
out
the
supper
,
which
be
arrange
in
the
large
old
flagged
parlour
,
which
serve
as

It

of
a
similar
description

retired
farmhouse
in
the
north
of
England

<EOS>
They
be
use
on
occasion
like
the
one
now
describe
for
purpose
of
hospitality
;
but
in
the
state
bed
,
overshadow
so
large
a
portion
of
the
floor
,
the
birth
and
,
as
far
as
may
be
,
the
death
,
of
the
household
take
place
.
<EOS>
at
the
Corneys
'
,
the
united
effort
of
some
former
generation
of
the
family
have
produce
patchwork
curtain
and
coverlet
;
and
patchwork
be
patchwork
in
those
day
,
before
the
early
Yates

find
out
the
secret
of

scrap
of
costly
indian
chintz
and
palempour

intermix
with
commoner
black
and
red
calico
in
minute
hexagon

and
the
variety
of
pattern
serve
for
the
useful
purpose
of
promote
conversation
as
well
as
the
more
obvious
one
of
display
the
work

woman

taste

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
for
instance
,
begin
at
once
to
her
old
friend
,
Molly
Brunton
,
who
have
accompany
her
into
this
chamber
to
take
off
her
hat
and
cloak
,
with
a
remark
on
one
of
the
chintz

stoop
over
the
counterpane

with
a
face
into
which
the
flush
would

<EOS>
no

to
Molly

"

when
Brunton

nought

Sylvia

take
off

by
this
time

begin
to

Molly

a
younger
unmarried

substantial

Her

much
pleased
with

Sylvia
be
rather
inclined
to
take
offence
at

It
be

perhaps

a

ungracious

answer
Molly

<EOS>
Molly
give
her
a
nudge
,
which
make
Sylvia
's
face
go
all
aflame
with
angry
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
that
the
watching
which
Molly
have
threaten
her
with
begin
directly
;
for
Molly
go
up
to
her
husband
,
and
whisper
something
to
him
which
set
him
off
in
a
chuckling
laugh
,
and
Sylvia
be
aware
that
his
eye
follow
her
about
with
know
<EOS>
look
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
She
would
hardly
speak
to
Philip
,
and
pretend
not
to
see
his
outstretched
hand
,
but
pass
on
to
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
try
to
shelter
herself
behind
the
broad
back
of
farmer
Corney
,
who
have
no
notion
of
relinquish
his
customary
place
for
all
the
young
people
who
ever
come
to
the
house
,
 
or
for
any
old
people
either
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
household
throne
,
and
there
he
sit
with
no
more
idea
of
abdicate
in
favour
of
any
comer
than
King
George
at
St
James
's
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
glad
to
see
his
friend
;
and
have
pay
them
the
unwonted
compliment
of
shave
on
a
week
-
day
,
and
put
on
his
Sunday
coat
.
<EOS>
the
united
effort
of
wife
and
child
have
fail
to
persuade
him
to
make
any
farther
change
in
his
attire
;
to
all
their
argument
on
this
head
he
have
reply
,
    
"
Them
as
do
not
like
t
'
see
me
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
work
-
a
-
day
wescut
and
breech
may
bide
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
long
sentence
<EOS>
he
say
that
day
,
but
he
repeat
it
several
time
over
.
<EOS>
He
be
glad
enough
to
see
all
the
young
people
,
but
they
be
not
"
of
his
kidney
,
"
as
he
express
it
to
himself
,
and
he
do
not
feel
any
call
upon
himself
to
entertain
them
.
<EOS>
He
leave
that
to
his
bustling
wife
,
all
smartness
and
smile
,
and
to
his
daughter
and
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
His
effort
at
hospitality
consist
in
sit
still
,
smoke
his
pipe
;
when
any
one
come
,
he
take
it
out
of
his
mouth
for
an
instant
,
and
nod
his
head
in
a
cheerful
friendly
way
,
without
a
word
of
speech
;
and
then
return
to
his
smoking
with
the
great
relish
for
the
moment
's
intermission
.
<EOS>
He
think
to
himself
:
    
"
They
be
a
set
o
'
young
chap
as
think
more
on
t
'
lass
than
on
baccy
;
 
they
will
find
out
their
mistake
in
time
;
give
'em
time
,
give
'em
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
before
eight
o'clock
,
he
go
as
quietly
as
a
man
of
twelve
stone
can
upstairs
to
bed
,
have
make
a
previous
arrangement
with
his
wife
that
she
should
bring
him
up
about
two
pound
of
spice
beef
,
and
a
hot
tumbler
of
stiff
grog
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
he
form
a
good
screen
for
Sylvia
,
who
be
rather
a
favourite
with
the
old
man
,
for
twice
he
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Feyther
smoke
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
reach
me
t
'
baccy
-
box
,
my
lass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
the
conversation
that
pass
between
her
and
her
near
neighbour
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
after
she
come
into
company
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
her
screen
,
she
feel
a
pair
of
eye
be
fix
upon
her
with
a
glow
of
admiration
deepen
their
honest
brightness
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
look
in
what
direction
<EOS>
she
would
,
she
catch
the
glance
of
those
eye
before
she
could
see
anything
else
.
<EOS>
so
she
play
with
her
apron
-
string
,
and
try
not
to
feel
so
conscious
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
pair
of
eye
,
 
not
such
beautiful
,
sparkle
eye
,
 
deep
-
set
,
earnest
,
sad
,
nay
,
even
gloomy
,
watch
her
every
movement
;
but
of
this
she
be
not
aware
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
not
recover
from
the
rebuff
she
have
give
him
by
refuse
his
offer
hand
,
and
be
stand
still
,
in
angry
silence
,
when
Mrs.
Corney
thrust
a
young
woman
just
arrive
upon
his
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"

off
the

on

as

and
call
over
their

;
"
an

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
go
off
to
her
duty
at
the
one
table
,
which
,
place
alongside
of
the
dresser
,
be
the
only
article
of
furniture
leave
in
the
middle
of
the
room
:
all
the
seat
be
arrange
as
close
to
the
four
wall
as
could
be
manage
.
<EOS>
the
candle
of
those
day
give
but
a
faint
light
compare
to
the
light
of
the
immense
fire
,
which
it
be
a
point
of
hospitality
to
keep
at
the
high
roaring
,
blaze
pitch
;
the
young
woman
occupy
the
seat
,
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
of
the
elder
one
,
who
,
in
an
eager
desire
to
show
their
capability
,
insist
on
help
Mrs.
Corney
in
her
duty
,
very
much
to
her
annoyance
,
as
there
be
certain
little
contrivance
for
eke
out
cream
,
and
adjust
the
strength
of
the
cup
of
tea
to
the
worldly
position
of
the
intend
drinker
,
which
she
do
not
like
every
one
to
see
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
,
 
whom
tea
do
not
embolden
,
and
who
have
as
yet
have
no
chance
of
strong
liquor
,
 
cluster
in
rustic
shyness
<EOS>
round
the
door
,
not
speak
even
to
themselves
,
except
now
and
then
,
<EOS>
when
one
,
apparently
the
wag
of
the
party
,
make
some
whisper
remark
,
which
set
them
all
off
laugh
;
but
in
a
minute
they
check
themselves
,
and
pass
the
back
of
their
hand
across
their
mouth
to
compose
that
unlucky
feature
,
and
then
some
would
try
to
fix
their
eye
on
the
rafter
of
the
ceiling
,
in
a
manner
which
be
decorous
if
rather
abstract
from
the
business
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
be
young
farmer
,
with
whom
Philip
have
nothing
in
common
,
and
from
whom
,
in
shy
reserve
,
he
have
withdraw
himself
when
he
first
come
in
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
wish
himself
among
them
sooner
than
set
to
talk
to
Nancy
Pratt
,
when
he
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
may
have
have
a
companion
less
to
his
mind
,
for
she
be
a
decent
young
woman
of
a
sober
age
,
less
inclined
to
giggle
than
many
of
the
young
one
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
time
that
he
be
make
commonplace
remark
to
her
he
be
wonder
if
he
have
offend
Sylvia
,
and
why
she
would
not
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
this
pre
-
occupation
of
his
thought
do
not
make
him
an
agreeable
companion
.
<EOS>
Nancy
Pratt
,
who
have
be
engage
for
some
year
to
a
mate
of
a
whaling
-
ship
,
perceive
something
of
his
state
of
mind
,
and
take
no
offence
at
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
try
to
give
him
pleasure
by
admire
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
heerd
tell
on
her
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
niver
think
she
be
be
so
pretty
,
and
so
staid
and
quiet
-
like
too
.
<EOS>
t
'
most
part

her
be
always
gape
-
gaze
to
catch
other
folk
's
eye
,
and
see
what
be
think
on
'em
;
but
she
look
just
like
a
child
,
a
bit
fluster
wi
'
come
into
company
,
and
gettin
'
into
as
dark
a
corner
and
bidin

as
still
as
she
can
.
  
<EOS>
just
then
Sylvia
lift
up
her
long
,
dark
lash
,
and
catch
the
same
glance
which
she
have
so
often
meet
before
 
Charley
Kinraid
be
stand
talk
to
Brunton
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire

place
 
she
start
back
into
the
shadow
as
if
she
have
not
expect
it
,
and
in
so
do
spilt
her
tea
all
over
her
gown
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
have
cry
,
she
feel
herself
so
awkward
,
and
as
if
everything
be
go
wrong
with
her
;
she
think
that
every
one
would
think
she
have
never
be
in
company
before
,
and
do
not
know
how
to
behave
;
and
while
she
be
thus
flutter
and
crimson
,
she
see
through
her
tearful
eye
Kinraid
on
his
knee
before
her
,
wipe
her
gown
with
his
silk
pocket
handkerchief
,
and
hear
him
speak
through
all
the
buzz
of
commiserating
voice

against

only
this
very
afternoon

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
perhaps
it
be
no
clumsiness
of
her
,
 
as
they
would
all
know
,
now
,
since
he
have
so
skilfully
lay
the
blame
somewhere
else
;
and
after
all
it
turn
out
that
her
accident
have
be
the
mean
of
bring
him
across
to
her
side
,
which
be
much
more
pleasant
than
have
him
opposite
,
stare
at
her
;
for
now
he
begin
to
talk
to
her
,
and
this
be
very
pleasant
,
although
she
be
rather
embarrassed
at
their
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
you
again
when
I
first
see
you
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
tone
which
imply
a
good
deal
more
than
be
utter
in
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
yo
'
at
once
,
"
she
reply
,
softly
,
and
then
she
blush
and
play
with
her
apron
-
string
,
and
wonder
if
she
ought
to
have
confess
to
the
clearness
of
her
recollection
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
grow
up
into
 
well
<EOS>
,
perhaps
it
be
not
manner
to
say
what
you
be
grow
into
 
<EOS>
anyhow
,
I
shall
not
forget
yo
'
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
More
playing
with
her
apron
-
string
,
and
head
hang
still
lower
down
,
though
the
corner
of
her
mouth
would
go
up
in
a
shy
smile
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Philip
watch
it
all
as
greedily
as
if
it
give
him
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'r
father
,
he
will
be
well
and
hearty
,
I
hope
?
"
ask
Charley
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Sylvia
,
and
then
she
wish
she
could
originate
some
remark
;
he
would
think
her
so
stupid
if
she
just
keep
on
say
such
little
short
bit
of
speech
,
and
if
he
think
her
stupid
he
may
perhaps
go
away
again
to
his
former
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
quite
far
enough
go
in
love
of
her
beauty
,
and
pretty
modest
way
,
not
to
care
much
whether
she
talk
or
no
,
so
long
as
she
show
herself
so
pleasingly
conscious
of
his
close
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
come
and
see
the
old
gentleman
;
and
your
mother
,
too
,
"
he
add
more
slowly
,
for
he
remember
that
his
visit
last
year
have
not
be
quite
so
much
welcome
by
Bell
Robson
as
by
her
husband
;
perhaps
it
be
because
of
the
amount
of
drink
which
he
and
Daniel
manage
to
get
through
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
this
year
to
be
more
careful
to
please
the
mother
of
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
when
tea
be
end
there
be
a
great
bustle
and
shifting
of
place
,
while
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
daughter
carry
out
tray
full
of
use
cup
,
and
great
platter
of
uneaten
bread
and
butter
into
the
back
-
kitchen
,
to
be
wash
up
after
the
guest
be
go
.
<EOS>
just
because
she
be
so
conscious
that
she
do
not
want
to
move
,
and
break
up
the
little
conversation
between
herself
and
Kinraid
,
Sylvia
force
herself
to
be
as
active
in
the
service
go
on
as
become
a
friend
of
the
house
;
and
she
be
too
much
her
mother
's
own
daughter
to
feel
comfortable
at
leave
all
the
thing
in
the
disorder
which
to
the
Corney
girl
be
second
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
this

she
,
load
herself
with
milk
and
cream

<EOS>
"

Nelly
Corney
,
"
Christmas

but
onest
a

if

and
mother
say
she
would
have
a
game
at
forfeit
first
thing
after
tea
to
loosen
folk
's
tongue
,
and
mix
up
t

lad

,
so
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
steer
her
careful
way
to
the
cold
chill
of
the
dairy
,
and
would
not
be
satisfied
till
she
have
carry
away
all
the
unused
provision
into
some
fresh
air
than
that
heat
by
the
fire
and
oven
use
for
the
long
day
's
cooking
of
pie
and
cake
and
much
roast
meat
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
back
a
round
of
red

face
"
lad
,
"
as
young
man
up
to
five
-
and
-
thirty
be
call
in
Lancashire
and
Yorkshire
if
they
be
not
marry
before
,
and
lass
,
whose
age
be
not
to
be
define
,
be
play
at
some
country
game
,
in
which
the
woman
be
apparently
more
interested
than
the
man
,
who
look
shamefaced
,
and
afraid
of
each
other
's
ridicule
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Corney
,
however
,
know
how
to
remedy
this
,
and
at
a
sign
from
her
a
great
jug
of
beer
be
bring
in
.
<EOS>
this
jug
be
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
and
be
in
the
shape
of
a
fat
man
in
white
knee
-
breech
,
and
a
three
-
corner
hat
;
with
one
arm
he
support
the
pipe
in
his
broad
,
smile
mouth
,
and
the
other
be
place
akimbo
and
form
the
handle
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
great
china
punch
-
bowl
fill
with
grog
make
after
an
old
ship
-
receipt
current
in
these
part
,
but
not
too
strong
,
because
if
their
visitor
have
too
much
to
drink
at
that
early
part
of
the
evening
"
it
would
spoil
t
'
fun
,
"
as
Nelly
Corney
have
observe
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
however
,
after
the
notion
of
hospitality
prevalent
at
that
time
in
high
circle
,
have
stipulate
that
each
man
should
have
"
enough
"
before
he
leave
the
house
;
enough
meaning
in
Monkshaven
parlance
the
liberty
of
get
drunk
,
if
they
think
fit
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
before
long
one
of
the
lad
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
admiration
for
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
old
gentleman
who
contain
liquor
 
and
go
up
to
the
tray
for
a
close
inspection
.
<EOS>
He
be
speedily
follow
by
other
amateur
of
curious
earthenware
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
Mr.
Brunton
(
who
have
be
charge
by
his
mother
-
in
-
law
with
the
due
supplying
of
liquor
 
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
that
every
man
should
have
his
fill
,
and
by
his
wife
and
her
sister
that
no
one
should
have
too
much
,
at
any
rate
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
,
)
think
fit
to
carry
out
Toby
to
be
replenish
;
and
a
fast
spirit
of
enjoyment
and
mirth
begin
to
reign
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
be
too
well
seasoned
to
care
what
amount
of
liquor
he
drink
;
Philip
have
what
be
call
a
weak
head
,
and
dislike
muddle
himself
with
drink
because
of
the
immediate
consequence
of
intense
feeling
of
irritability
,
and
the
more
distant
one
of
a
rack
headache
next
day
;
so
both
these
two
preserve
very
much
the
same
demeanour
they
have
hold
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
by
all
acknowledge
and
treat
as
the
belle
.
<EOS>
when
they
play
at
blind

buff
go
where
she
would
,
she
be
always
catch
;
she
be
call
out
repeatedly
to
do
what
be
require
in
any
game
,
as
if
all
have
a
pleasure
in
see
her
light
figure
and
deft
way
.
<EOS>
She
be
sufficiently
pleased
with
this
to
have
get
over
her
shyness
with
all
except
Charley
.
<EOS>
when
other
pay
her
their
rustic
compliment
she
toss
her
head
,
and
make
her
little
saucy
repartee
;
but
when
he
say
something
low
and
flattering
,
it
be
too
honey
-
sweet
to
her
heart
to
be
throw
off
thus
.
<EOS>
and
,
somehow
,
the
more
she
yield
to
this
fascination
the
more
she
avoid
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
flatteringly
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
pay
compliment
 
<EOS>
he
watch
her
with
discontent
,
longing
eye
,
and
grow
more
inclined
every
moment
,
as
he
remember
his
anticipation
of
a
happy
evening
,
to
cry
out
in
his
heart
_
vanita
vanitatum

<EOS>
and
now
come
cry
the
forfeit
.
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
kneel
down
,
her

bury
in
her
mother

lap
;
the

take
out
the
forfeit
one
by
one
,
and
as
she
hold
them
up
,
say
the
accustomed
formula
,
    
"
a
fine
thing
and
a
very
fine

,
what

<EOS>
one

two
have
be
tell
to
kneel
to
the
prettiest
,
bow
to
the
witty

and
kiss
those
they

have
to
bite
an
inch
off
the
poker

or
such
play
upon

<EOS>
and
now
come
Sylvia
's
pretty
new
ribbon
that
Philip
have
give
her
<EOS>
(
he
almost
long
to
snatch
it
out
of
Mrs.

hand
and
burn
it
before
all
their

<EOS>
so
annoyed

<EOS>
"
She
must
blow

"
  
<EOS>
in
one
instant
Kinraid
have
hold
of
the
only
candle
within
reach
,
all
the
other
have
be
put
up
high
on
inaccessible
shelf
and
other
place

<EOS>
Sylvia
go
up
and
blow
out
the
candle
,
and
before
the
sudden
partial
darkness
be
over
he
have
take
the
candle
into
his
finger
,
and
,
accord
to
the
traditional

Philip

who
almost
choke

<EOS>
"
I
be

"
say
Kinraid
,
with
less
of
triumph
in
his
voice
than
he
would
have
have
with
any
other
girl
in
the
room

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I

Sylvia

in
a

with
fresh

in
her
heart
as
she
take
her
old
place
in
the
corner
of
the

a
little
away
from

<EOS>
Philip
's
spirit
rise
,
and
he
yearn
to
go
to
her
and
tell
her
how
he
approve
of
her
conduct

<EOS>
alas
,
Philip

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
though
as
modest
a
girl
as
ever
live
,
be
no
prude
,
and
have
be
bring
up
in
simple
,
straightforward
country
way
;
and
with
any
other
young
man
,
excepting
,
perhaps
,
Philip
's
self
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
think
no
more
of
make
a
rapid
pretence
of
kiss
the
hand
or
cheek
of
the
temporary
"
candlestick
"
,
than
our
ancestress
do
in
a
much
high
rank
on
similar
occasion

<EOS>
Kinraid
,
though
mortify
by
his
public
rejection
,
be
more
conscious
of
this
than
the
inexperienced
Philip
;
he
resolve
not
to
be
baulk
,
and
watch
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
for
the
time
he
go
on
play
as
if
Sylvia
's
conduct
have
not
affect
him
in
the
least
,
and
as
if
he
be
hardly
aware
of
her
defection
from
the
game
.
<EOS>
as
she
see
other
submit
,
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
similar
penance
,
she
begin
to
be
angry
with
herself
for
have
think
twice
about
it
,
and
almost
to
dislike
herself
for
the
strange
consciousness
which
have
make
it
at
the
time
seem
impossible
to
do
what
she
be
tell
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
keep
fill
with
tear
as
her
isolated
position
in
the
gay
party
,
the
thought
of
what
a
fool
she
have
make
of
herself
,
keep
recur
to
her
mind
;
but
no
one
see
her
,
she
think
,
thus
cry
;
and
,
ashamed
to
be
discover
when
the
party
should
pause
in
their
game
,
she
steal
round
behind
them
into
the
great
chamber
in
which
she
have
help
to
lay
out
the
supper
,
with
the
intention
of
bathe
her
eye
,
and
take
a
drink
of
water
.
<EOS>
one
instant
Charley
Kinraid
be
miss
from
the
circle
of
which
he
be
the
life
and
soul
;
and
then
back
he
come
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
on
his
face
,
intelligible
enough
to
those
who
have
see
his
game
;
but
unnoticed
by
Philip
,
who
,
amidst
the
perpetual
noise
and
movement
around
him
,
have
not
perceive
Sylvia
's
leave
the
room
,
until
she
come
back
at
the
end
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
look
lovely
than
ever
,
her
complexion
brilliant
,
her
eye
droop
,
her
hair
neatly
and
freshly
arrange
,
tie
with
a
brown
ribbon
instead
of
that
she
be
suppose
to
have
forfeit
.
<EOS>
She
look
as
if
she
do
not
wish
her
return
to
be
notice
,
steal
softly
behind
the
romp
lad
and
lass
with
noiseless
motion
,
and
altogether
such
a
contrast
to
them
in
her
cool
freshness
and
modest
neatness
,
that
both
Kinraid
and
Philip
find
it
difficult
to
keep
their
eye
off
her
.
<EOS>
but
the
former
have
a
secret
triumph
in
his
heart
which
enable
him
to
go
on
with
his
merry
-
making
as
if
it
absorb
him
;
while
Philip
drop
out
of
the
crowd
and
come
up
to
where
she
be
stand
silently
by
Mrs.
Corney
,
who
,
arm
akimbo

be
laugh
at
the
frolic
and
fun
around
her

<EOS>
Sylvia
start
a
little
when
Philip
speak
,
and
keep
her
soft
eye
avert
from
him
after
the
first
glance
;
she
answer
him
shortly
,
but
with
unaccustomed
gentleness
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
ask
her
when
she
would
like
him
to
take
her
home
;
and
she
,
a
little
surprised
at
the
idea
of
go
home
when

<EOS>
but
yo'r
mother
will
lie
awake
till
<EOS>
yo
'
come
home
,
Sylvie
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Corney
,
have
hear
his
question
,
break
in
with
all
sort
of
upbraiding
.
<EOS>
"
go
home
!
<EOS>
not
see
t
'
New
Year
in
!
<EOS>
why
,
what
should
take
'em
home
these
six
hour
?
<EOS>
be
not
there
a
moon
as
clear
as
day
?
<EOS>
and
do
such
a
time
as
this
come
often
?
<EOS>
and
be
they
to
break
up
the
party
before
the
New
Year
come
in
?
<EOS>
and
be
there
not
supp
,
with
a
spice
round
of
beef
that
have
be
in
pickle
pretty
nigh
sin
'
Martinmas
,
and
hams
,
and
mince
-
pie
,
and
what
not
?
<EOS>
and
if
they
think
any
evil
of
her
master
be
go
to
bed
,
or
that
by
that
early
retirement
he
mean
to
imply
that
he
do
not
bid
his
friend
welcome
,
why
he
would
not
stay
up
beyond
eight
o'clock
for
King
George
upon
his
throne
,
as
he
would
tell
them
soon
enough
,
if
they
would
only
step
upstairs
and
ask
him
.
<EOS>
well
;
she
know
what
it
be
to
want
a
daughter
when
she
be
ail
,
so
she
would
say
nought
more
,
but
hasten
supper
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
idea
now
take
possession
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
mind
,
for
she
would
not
willingly
allow
one
of
her
guest
to
leave
before
they
have
do
justice
to
her
preparation
;
and
,
cut
her
speech
short
,
she
hastily
leave
Sylvia
and
Philip
together
.
  
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
fast
;
his
feeling
towards
her
have
never
be
so
strong
or
so
distinct
as
since
her
refusal
to
kiss
the
"
candlestick
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
point
of
speak
,
of
say
something
explicitly
tender
,
when
the
wooden
trencher
which
the
party
be
use
at
their
play
,
come
bowl
between
him
and
Sylvia
,
and
spin
out
its
little
period
right
betwixt
them
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
move
from
chair
to
chair
,
and
when
the
bustle
be
over
Sylvia
be
seat
at
some
distance
from
him
,
and
he
leave
stand
outside
the
circle
,
as
if
he
be
not
play
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Sylvia
have
unconsciously
take
his
place
as
actor
in
the
game
while
he
remain
spectator
,
and
,
as
it
turn
out
,
an
auditor
of
a
conversation
not
intend
for
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
be
wedge
against
the
wall
,
close
to
the
great
eight
-
day
clock
,
with
its
round
moon
-
like
smile
face
form
a
ludicrous
contrast
to
his
long
,
sallow
,
grave
countenance
,
which
be
pretty
much
at
the
same
level
above
the
sanded
floor
.
<EOS>
before
him
sit
Molly
Brunton
and
one
of
her
sister
,
their
head
close
together
in
too
deep
talk
to
attend
to
the
progress
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
attention
be
catch
by
the
word
    
<EOS>
"
I
will
lay
any
wager
he
kiss
her
when
he
run
off
into
t
'
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
so
coy
<EOS>
she
would
niver
let
him
,
"
reply
Bessy
Corney
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
help
hersel
'
;
and
for
all
she
look
so
demure
and
prim
now
'
<EOS>
(
and
then
both
head
be
turn
in
the
direction
of
Sylvia
)
,
"
I
be
as
sure
as
I
be
bear
that
Charley
be
not
t
'
chap
to
lose
his
forfeit
;
and
yet
yo
'
see
he
say
nought
more
about
it
,
and
she
be
leave
off
be
"
fear
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
Sylvia
's
look
,
ay
,
and
in
Charley
Kinraid
's
,
too
,
that
shoot
conviction
into
Philip
's
mind
.
<EOS>
He
watch
them
incessantly
during
the
interval
before
supper
;
they
be
intimate
,
and
yet
shy
with
each
other
,
in
a
manner
that
enrage
while
it
bewilder
Philip
.
<EOS>
what
be
Charley
say
to
her
in
that
whisper
voice
,
as
they
pass
each
other
?
<EOS>
why
do
they
linger
near
each
other
?
<EOS>
why
do
Sylvia
look
so
dreamily
happy
,
so
startled
at
every
call
of
the
game
,
as
if
recall
from
some
pleasant
idea
?
<EOS>
why
do
Kinraid
's
eye
always
seek
her
while
her
be
avert
,
or
downcast
,
and
her
cheek
all
aflame
?
<EOS>
Philip
's
dark
brow
grow
dark
as
he
gaze
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
start
when
Mrs.
Corney
,
close
at
his
elbow
,
bade
him
go
in
to
supper
along
with
some
of
the
elder
one
,
who
be
not
play
;
for
the
parlour
be
not
large
enough
to
hold
all
at
once
,
even
with
the
squeezing
and
cramming
,
and
sit
together
on
chair
,
which
be
not
at
all
out
of
etiquette
at
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
too
reserve
to
express
his
disappointment
and
annoyance
at
be
thus
arrest
in
his
painful
watch
over
Sylvia
;
but
he
have
no
appetite
for
the
good
thing
set
before
him
,
and
find
it
hard
work
to
smile
a
sickly
smile
when
call
upon
by
Josiah
Pratt
for
applause
at
some
country
joke
.
<EOS>
when
supper
be
end
,
there
be
some
little
discussion
between
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
son
-
in
-
law
as
to
whether
the
different
individual
of
the
company
should
be
call
upon
for
song
or
story
,
as
be
the
will
not
at
such
convivial
meeting
.
<EOS>
Brunton
have
be
help
his
mother
-
in
-
law
in
urge
people
to
eat
,
heap
their
plate
over
their
shoulder
with
unexpected
good
thing
,
fill
the
glass
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
and
the
mug
which
supply
the
deficiency
of
glass
at
the
low
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
every
one
be
satisfy
,
not
to
say
stuff
to
repletion
,
the
two
who
have
be
attend
to
their
want
stand
still
,
hot
and
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
a'most
stawe
,
"
say
Mrs.
Corney
,
with
a
pleased
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
manners
t
'
ask
some
one
as
know
how
to
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
manner
for
full
man
,
but
not
for
fast
,
"
reply
Brunton
.
<EOS>
"
folk
in
t
'
next
room
will
be
want
their
victual
,
and
singing
be
allays
out
o

tune
to
empty
belly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
them
here
as
will
take
it
ill
if
they
be
not
ask
.
<EOS>
I
heerd
Josiah
Pratt
a
-
clear
his
throat
not
a
minute
ago
,
an
'
he
think
as
much
on
his
singin

as
a
cock
do
on

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
one
sing
I
be
afeard
all
on
'em
will
like
to
hear
their
own
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
their
dilemma
be
solve
by
Bessy
Corney
,
who
open
the
door
to
see
if
the
hungry
one
outside
may
not
come
in
for
their
share
of
the
entertainment
;
and
in
they
rush
,
bright
and
riotous
,
scarcely
give
the
first
party
time
to
rise
from
their
seat
ere
<EOS>
they
take
their
place
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
young
man
,
release
from
all
their
previous
shyness
,
help
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
daughter
to
carry
off
such
dish
as
be
actually
empty
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
time
for
change
or
washing
of
plate
;
but
then
,
as
Mrs.
Corney
laughingly
observe
,
    
"
We
be
a
'
on
us
friend
,
and
some
on
us
mayhap
sweetheart
;
so
no
need
to
be
particular
about
plate
.
<EOS>
Them
as
get
clean
one
be
lucky
;
and
them
as
do
not
,
and
can
not
put
up
wi
'
plate
that
have
be
use
,
mun
go
without

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
Philip
's
luck
this
night
to
be
pen
up
in
place
;
for
again
the
space
between
the
bench
and
the
wall
be
fill
up
by
the
in
-
rush
before
he
have
time
to
make
his
way
out
;
and
all
he
could
do
be
to
sit
quiet
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
but
between
the
busy
head
and
over
-
reach
arm
he
could
see
Charley
and
Sylvia
,
sit
close
together
,
talk
and
listen
more
than
eat
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
new
strange
state
of
happiness
not
to
be
reason
about
,
or
account
for
,
but
in
a
state
of
more
exquisite
feeling
than
she
have
ever
experience
before
;
when
,
suddenly
lift
her
eye
,
she
catch
Philip
's
face
of
extreme
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
Philip
look
at
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Philip

"
say
Kinraid
,
with
a
sudden
frown
upon
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
,
"
she
reply
,
instinctively
comprehend
what
have
flash
into
his
mind
,
and
anxious
to
disclaim
the
suspicion
of
have
a
lover
.
"
<EOS>
mother
tell
him
to
see
me
home
,
and
he
be
noan
one
for
stay
up
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
need
not
go
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
yo
'
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
's
but
ailing
,
"
say
Sylvia
,
a
little
conscience
-
smitten
at
have
so
entirely
forget
everything
in
the
delight
of
the
present
,
"
and
I
say
I
would
not
be
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
allays
keep
to
your
word
?
"
<EOS>
ask
he
,
with
a
tender
meaning
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Allays
<EOS>
;
leastway
I
think
so
,
"
reply
she
,
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
if
I
ask
you
not
to
forget
me
,
and
you
give
me
your
word
,
I
may
be
sure
you
will
keep
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
I
as
forgot
you
,
"
say
Sylvia
,
so
softly
as
not
to
be
hear
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
try
to
make
her
repeat
what
she
have
say
,
but
she
would
not
,
and
he
could
only
conjecture
that
it
be
something
more
tell
-
tale
than
she
like
to
say
again
,
and
that
alone
be
very
charming
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
walk
home
with
you
,
"
say
he
,
as
Sylvia
at
last
rise
to
depart
,
warn
by
a
further
glimpse
of
Philip
's
angry
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
say
she
,
hastily
,
"
I
can
not
do
with
yo
'
'
;
for
somehow
she
feel
the
need
of
pacify
Philip
,
and
know
in
her
heart
that
a
third
person
join
their
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
walk
would
only
increase
his
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
say
Charley
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
only
please
do
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
her
cloak
and
hood
be
on
,
and
she
be
slowly
make
her
way
down
her
side
of
the
room
follow
by
Charley
,
and
often
interrupt
by
indignant
remonstrance
against
her
departure
,
and
the
early
breaking
-
up
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Philip
stand
,
hat
in
hand
,
in
the
doorway
between
the
kitchen
and
parlour
,
watch
her
so
intently
that
he
forget
to
be
civil
,
and
draw
many
a
jest
and
gibe
upon
him
for
his
absorption
in
his
pretty
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
when
Sylvia
reach
him
,
he
say
,
    
<EOS>
"
Yo're
ready
at
last
,
be
yo
'
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
reply
,
in
her
little
beseech
tone
.
"
<EOS>
yo've
not

?
<EOS>
I
ha

but
just

<EOS>
"
  
"
Yo've
be
so
full
of

,
that
be

the
reason

so
long
.
<EOS>
that
fellow
's
none

wi
'
us
?
"
say
he
sharply
,
as
he
see
Kinraid
rummage
for
his
cap
in
a
heap
of
man
's
clothe
,
throw
into
the
back
-
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Sylvia
,
in
affright
at
Philip
's
fierce
look
and
passionate
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
not

"
  
<EOS>
but
at
that
moment
the
heavy
outer
door
be
open
by
Daniel
Robson
himself
 
bright
,
broad
,
and
rosy
,
a
jolly
impersonation
of
Winter
.
<EOS>
His
large
drover
's
coat
be
cover
with
snow
-
flake
,
and
through
the
black
frame
of
the
doorway
may
be
see
a
white
waste
world
of
sweep
fell
and
field
,
with
the
dark
air
fill
with
the
pure
down

fall
.
<EOS>
Robson
stamp
his
snow
-
laden
foot
and
shake
himself
well
,
still
stand
on
the
mat
,
and
let
a
cold
frosty
current
of
fresh
air
into
the
great
warm
kitchen

<EOS>
He
laugh
at
them
all
before

Kinraid

with
easy
freedom
 
<EOS>
a
freedom
which
Philip
envy
,
but
could
not
have
imitate
,
although
he
be
deeply
disappointed
at
the
loss
of
his
walk
with
Sylvia
,
when
he
have
intend
to
exercise
the
power
his
aunt
have
delegate
to
him
of
remonstrance
if
her
behaviour
have
be
light
or
thoughtless
,
and
of
warning
if
he
see
cause
to
disapprove
of
any
of
her
associate

<EOS>
after
the
Robsons
have
leave
,
a
blank
fall
upon
both
Charley
and
Philip
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
,
however
,
the
former
,
accustomed
to
prompt
decision
,
resolve
that
she
and
no
other
should
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
accustomed
to
popularity
among
woman
,
and
well
verse
in
the
incipient
sign
of
their
like
for
him
,
he
anticipate
no
difficulty
in
win
her
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
the
past
,
and
pleasantly
hopeful
about
the
future
,
he
find
it
easy
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
next
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
,
and
to
make
the
whole
gathering
bright
with
his
ready
good
temper
and
buoyant
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Corney
have
feel
it
her
duty
to
press
Philip
to
stay
,
now
that
,
as
she
say
,
he
have
no
one
but
himself
to
see
home
,
and
the
new
year
so
near
come
in
.
<EOS>
to
any
one
else
in
the
room
she
would
have
add
the
clinching
argument
,
"
a
shall
take
it
very
unkind
if
yo
'
go
now
'
;
but
somehow
she
could
not
say
this
,
for
in
truth
Philip
's
look
show
that
he
would
be
but
a
wet
blanket
on
the
merriment
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
so
,
with
as
much
civility
as
could
be
muster
up
between
them
,
he
take
leave
.
<EOS>
shut
the
door
behind
him
,
he
go
out
into
the
dreary
night
,
and
begin
his
lonesome
walk
back
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
the
cold
sleet
almost
blind
him
as
the
sea
-
wind
drive
it
straight
in
his
face
;
it
cut
against
him
as
it
be
blow
with
drift
force
.
<EOS>
the
roar
of
the
wintry
sea
come
borne
on
the
breeze
;
there
be
more
light
from
the
whitened
ground
than
from
the
dark
laden
sky
above
.
<EOS>
the
field
-
path
would
have
be
a
matter
of
perplexity
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
well
-
know
gap
in
the
dyke
-
side
,
which
show
the
whitened
land
beyond
,
between
the
two
dark
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
yet
he
go
clear
and
straight
along
his
way
,
have
unconsciously
leave
all
guidance
to
the
animal
instinct
which
co
-
exist
with
the
human
soul
,
and
sometimes
take
strange
charge
of
the
human
body
,
when
all
the
noble
power
of
the
individual
be
absorb
in
acute
suffering
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
be
in
the
lane
,
toil
up
the
hill
,
from
which
,
by
day
,
Monkshaven
may
be
see
.
<EOS>
now
all
feature
of
the
landscape
before
him
be
lose
in
the
darkness
of
night
,
against
which
the
white
flake
come
closer
and
near
,
thick
and
faster
.
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
,
the
bell
of
Monkshaven
church
ring
out
a
welcome
to
the
new
year
,
1796
.
<EOS>
from
the
direction
of
the
wind
,
it
seem
as
if
the
sound
be
flung
with
strength
and
power
right
into
Philip
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
walk
down
the
hill
to
its
merry
sound
 
its
merry
sound
,
his
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
as
he
enter
the
long
High
Street
of
Monkshaven
he
could
see
the
watch
light
put
out
in
parlour
,
chamber
,
or
kitchen
.
<EOS>
the
new
year
have
come
,
and
expectation
be
end
.
<EOS>
reality
have
begin
.
  
<EOS>
He
turn
to
the
right
,
into
the
court
where
he
lodge
with
Alice
Rose
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
light
still
burn
there
,
and
cheerful
voice
be
hear
.
<EOS>
He
open
the
door
;
Alice
,
her
daughter
,
and
Coulson
stand
as
if
await
him
.
<EOS>
Hester
's
wet
cloak
hang
on
a
chair
before
the
fire
;
she
have
her
hood
on
,
<EOS>
for
she
and
Coulson
have
be
to
the
watch
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
solemn
excitement
of
the
service
have
leave
its
trace
upon
her
countenance
and
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
spiritual
light
in
her
usually
shadow
eye
,
and
a
slight
flush
on
her
pale
cheek
.
<EOS>
merely
personal
and
self
-
conscious
feeling
be
merge
in
a
love
good
-
will
to
all
her
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
this
large
charity
,
she
forget
her
habitual
reserve
,
and
come
forward
as
Philip
enter
to
meet
him
with
her
new
year
's
wish
 
<EOS>
wish
that
she
have
previously
interchange
with
the
other
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
happy
new
year
to
you
,
Philip
,
and
may
God
have
you
in
his
keep
all
the
day
thereof
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
,
and
shake
it
warmly
in
reply
.
<EOS>
the
flush
on
her
cheek
deepen
as
she
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
say
something
curtly
about
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
her
be
much
tired
;
and
then
she
and
her
daughter
go
upstairs
to
the
front
chamber
,
and
Philip
and
Coulson
to
that
which
they
share
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
PERPLEXITIES
  
<EOS>
Coulson
and
Philip
be
friendly
,
but
not
intimate
.
<EOS>
They
never
have
have
a
dispute
,
they
never
be
confidential
with
each
other
;
in
truth
,
they
be
both
reserved
and
silent
man
,
and
,
probably
,
respect
each
other
the
more
for
be
so
self
-
contain
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
private
feeling
in
Coulson
's
heart
which
would
have
make
a
less
amiable
fellow
dislike
Philip
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
the
latter
be
unconscious
:
they
be
not
apt
to
exchange
many
word
in
the
room
which
they
occupy
jointly
.
  
<EOS>
Coulson
ask
Philip
if
he
have
enjoy
himself
at
the
Corneys
'
,
and
Philip
reply
,
    
"
not
much
;
such
party
be
noane
to
my
liking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
thou
break
off
from
t
'
watch
-
night
to
go
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
no
answer
;
so
Coulson
go
on
,
with
a
sense
of
the
duty
lay
upon
him
,
to
improve
the
occasion
 
the
first
that
have
present
itself
since
the
good
old
Methodist
minister
have
give
his
congregation
the
solemn
warning
to
watch
over
the
opportunity
of
various
kind
which
the
coming
year
would
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jonas
Barclay
tell
us
as
the
pleasure
o
'
<EOS>
this
world
be
like
apple
o
'
Sodom
,
pleasant
to
look
at
,
but
ashe
to
taste
.
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
wisely
leave
Philip
to
make
the
application
for
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
he
make
no
sign
,
but
throw
himself
on
his
bed
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
yo
'
not
go
to
undress
?
"
say
Coulson
,
as
he
cover
him
up
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
long
pause
of
silence
.
<EOS>
Philip
do
not
answer
him
,
and
he
think
he
have
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
rouse
from
his
first
slumber
by
Hepburn
's
soft
movement
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
think
better
of
it
,
and
,
with
some
penitence
in
his
heart
for
his
gruffness
to
the
unoffending
Coulson
,
be
try
not
to
make
any
noise
while
he
undress
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
keep
see
the
Corneys
'
kitchen
and
the
scene
that
have
take
place
in
it
,
pass
like
a
pageant
before
his
close
eye
.
<EOS>
then
he
open
them
in
angry
weariness
at
the
recur
vision
,
and
try
to
make
out
the
outline
of
the
room
and
the
furniture
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
the
white
ceiling
slope
into
the
whitewashed
wall
,
and
against
them
he
could
see
the
four
rush
-
bottom
chair
,
the
looking
-
glass
hang
on
one
side
,
the
old
carved
oak
-
chest
(
his
own
property
,
with
the
initial
of
forget
ancestor
cut
upon
it
)
,
which
hold
his
clothe
;
the
box
that
belong
to
Coulson
,
sleep
soundly
in
the
bed
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
;
the
casement
window
in
the
roof
,
through
which
the
snowy
ground
on
the
steep
hill
-
side
could
be
plainly
see
;
and
when
he
get
so
far
as
this
in
the
catalogue
of
the
room
,
he
fall
into
a
troubled
feverish
sleep
,
which
last
two
or
three
hour
;
and
then
he
awake
with
a
start
,
and
a
consciousness
of
uneasiness
,
though
what
about
he
could
not
remember
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
recollect
all
that
have
happen
the
night
before
,
it
impress
him
much
more
favourably
than
it
have
do
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
if
not
joy
,
hope
have
come
in
the
morning
;
and
,
at
any
rate
,
he
could
be
up
and
be
do
,
for
the
late
wintry
light
be
steal
down
the
hill
-
side
,
and
he
know
that
,
although
Coulson
lie
motionless
in
his
sleep
,
it
be
past
their
usual
time
of
rise
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
it
be
new
year
's
Day
,
a
time
of
some
licence
,
Philip
have
mercy
on
his
fellow
-
shopman
,
and
do
not
waken
him
till
just
as
he
be
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
carry
his
shoe
in
his
hand
,
he
go
softly
downstairs
for
he
could
see
from
the
top
of
the
flight
that
neither
Alice
nor
her
daughter
be
down
yet
,
as
the
kitchen
shutter
be
not
unclosed
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs.
Rose
's
habit
to
rise
early
,
and
have
all
bright
and
clean
against
her
lodger
come
down
;
but
then
,
in
general
,
she
go
to
rest
before
nine
o'clock
,
whereas
the
last
night
she
have
not
go
till
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
Philip
go
about
undo
the
shutter
,
and
try
to
break
up
the
rake
coal
,
with
as
little
noise
as
may
be
,
for
he
have
compassion
on
the
tired
sleeper
.
<EOS>
the
kettle
have
not
be
fill
,
probably
because
Mrs.
Rose
have
be
unable
to
face
the
storm
of
the
night
before
,
in
take
it
to
the
pump
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
when
Philip
come
back
from
fill
it
,
he
find
Alice
and
Hester
both
in
the
kitchen
,
and
try
to
make
up
for
lose
time
by
hasten
over
their
work
.
<EOS>
Hester
look
busy
and
notable
with
her
gown
pin
up
behind
her
,
and
her
hair
all
tuck
away
under
a
clean
linen
cap
;
but
Alice
be
angry
with
herself
for
her
late
sleeping
,
and
that
and
other
cause
make
her
speak
crossly
to
Philip
,
as
he
come
in
with
his
snowy
foot
and
well
-
fill
kettle
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
the
'
there
!
<EOS>
droppin
'
and
drippin
'
along
t
'
flag
as
be
clean
last
night
,
and
meddlin
'
<EOS>
wi
'
woman
's
work
as
a
man
have
no
business
wi
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
surprised
and
annoyed
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
relief
from
his
own
thought
in
do
what
he
believe
would
help
other
.
<EOS>
He
give
up
the
kettle
to
her
snatch
hand
,
and
sate
down
behind
the
door
in
momentary
ill
-
temper
.
<EOS>
but
the
kettle
be
better
fill
,
and
consequently
heavy
than
the
old
woman
expect
,
and
she
could
not
manage
to
lift
it
to
the
crook
from
which
it
generally
hang
suspend
.
<EOS>
She
look
round
for
Hester
,
but
she
be
go
into
the
back
-
kitchen
.
<EOS>
in
a
minute
Philip
be
at
her
side
,
and
have
heave
it
to
its
place
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
look
in
his
face
for
a
moment
wistfully
,
but
hardly
condescend
to
thank
him
;
at
least
the
sound
of
the
word
do
not
pass
the
lip
that
form
them
.
<EOS>
rebuff
by
her
manner
,
he
go
back
to
his
old
seat
,
and
mechanically
watch
the
preparation
for
breakfast
;
but
his
thought
go
back
to
the
night
before
,
and
the
comparative
ease
of
his
heart
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
first
stir
of
a
new
day
have
make
him
feel
as
if
he
have
have
no
sufficient
cause
for
his
annoyance
and
despondency
the
previous
evening
;
but
now
,
condemn
to
sit
quiet
,
he
review
look
and
word
,
and
see
just
reason
for
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
after
some
consideration
he
resolve
to
go
that
very
night
to
Haytersbank
,
and
have
some
talk
with
either
Sylvia
or
her
mother
;
what
the
exact
nature
of
this
purpose
conversation
should
be
,
he
do
not
determine
;
much
would
depend
on
Sylvia
's
manner
and
mood
,
and
on
her
mother
's
state
of
health
;
but
at
any
rate
something
would
be
learn
.
  
<EOS>
during
breakfast
something
be
learn
nearer
home
;
though
not
all
that
a
man
less
unconscious
and
more
vain
than
Philip
may
have
discover
.
<EOS>
He
only
find
out
that
Mrs.
Rose
be
displeased
with
him
for
not
have
go
to
the
watch
-
night
with
Hester
,
accord
to
the
plan
make
some
week
before
.
<EOS>
but
he
soothe
his
conscience
by
remember
that
he
have
make
no
promise
;
he
have
merely
speak
of
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
service
,
about
which
Hester
be
speak
;
and
although
at
the
time
and
for
a
good
while
afterwards
,
he
have
fully
intend
go
,
yet
as
there
have
be
William
Coulson
to
accompany
her
,
his
absence
could
not
have
be
seriously
notice
.
<EOS>
still
he
be
make
uncomfortable
by
Mrs.
Rose
's
change
of
manner
;
once
or
twice
he
say
to
himself
that
she
little
know
how
miserable
he
have
be

bitterness
this

the

Philip

and
the
consequence
be
that
his

not

<EOS>
Philip
take
the
handkerchief
and
hope
he
have
make
honourable
amend
for
his
want
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
but
the
wee
lassie
refuse
to
be
lift
down
,
and
whisper
something
afresh
into
her
mother
's
ear
,
who
smile
and
bade
her
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
Philip
see
,
however
,
that
there
be
some
wish
ungratifie
on
the
part
of
the
little
maiden
which
he
be
expect
to
inquire
into
,
and
,
accordingly
,
he
do
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
She

"
  
<EOS>
the
child
burrow
her
face
closer
into
her
mother
's
neck
,
and
refuse
to
allow
the
kiss
which
Philip
willingly
offer
.
<EOS>
all
he
could
do
be
to
touch
the
back
of
the
little
white
fat
neck
with
his
lip
.
<EOS>
the
mother
carry
her
off
only
half
satisfied
,
and
Philip
feel
that
he
must
try
and
collect
his
scatter
wit
,
and
be
more
alive
to
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
towards
the
dinner
-
hour
the
crowd
slacken
;
Hester
begin
to
replenish
decanter
and
bottle
,
and
to
bring
out
a
fresh
cake
before
she
go
home
to
dinner
;
and
Coulson
and
Philip
look
over
the
joint
present
they
always
make
to
her
on
this
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
silk
handkerchief
of
the
pretty
colour
they
could
pick
out
of
the
shop
,
intend
for
her
to
wear
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
each
try
to
persuade
the
other
to
give
it
to
her
,
for
each
be
shy
of
the
act
of
presentation
.
<EOS>
Coulson
be
,
however
,
the
most
resolute
;
and
when
she
return
from
the
parlour
the
little
parcel
be
in
Philip
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Hester

say
he
,
go
round
the
counter
to
her
,
just
as
she
be

the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
from
Coulson
and
me
;
a
handkerchief
for

and
we
wish

a
happy
New

and
plenty

and
there

many
<EOS>
a
one
wish
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
as
he
say
this
.
<EOS>
She
go
a
little
paler
,
and
her
eye
brighten
as
though
they
would
fill
with
tear
as
they
meet
his
;
she
could
not
have
help
it
,
do
what
she
would
.
<EOS>
but
she
only
say
,
"
thank
yo
'
kindly
,
"
and
go
up
to
Coulson
she
repeat
the
word
and
action
to
him
;
and
then
they
go
off
together
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
lull
of
business
for
the
next
hour
.
<EOS>
John
and
Jeremiah
be
dine
like
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
even
the
eld
errand
-
boy
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
Philip
rearrange
disorderly
good
;
and
then
sate
down
on
the
counter
by
the
window
;
it
be
the
habitual
place
for
the
one
who
stay
behind
;
for
except
on
market
-
day
there
be
little
or
no
custom
during
the
noon
-
hour
.
<EOS>
formerly
he
use
to
move
the
drapery
with
which
the
window
be
ornament
,
and
watch
the
passer
-
by
with
careless
eye
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
though
he
seem
to
gaze
abroad
,
he
see
nothing
but
vacancy
.
<EOS>
all
the
morning
since
he
get
up
<EOS>
he
have
be
try
to
fight
through
his
duty
 
lean
against
a
hope
 
<EOS>
a
hope
that
first
have
bow
,
and
then
have
break
as
soon
as
he
really
try
its
weight
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
sign
of
Sylvia
's
like
for
him
to
be
gather
from
the
most
careful
recollection
of
the
past
evening
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
thinking
that
there
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
give
it
up
altogether
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
what
if
he
could
not
?
<EOS>
what
if
the
thought
of
her
be
bind
up
with
his
life
;
and
that
once
tear
out
by
his
own
free
will
,
the
very
root
of
his
heart
must
come
also
?
  
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
he
be
resolve
he
would
go
on
;
as
long
as
there
be
life
there
be
hope
;
as
long
as
Sylvia
remain
unpledged
to
any
one
else
,
there
be
a
chance
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
remodel
his
behaviour
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
merry
and
light
-
hearted
like
other
young
man
;
his
nature
be
not
cast
in
that
mould
;
and
the
early
sorrow
that
have
leave
him
a
lonely
orphan
may
have
mature
,
but
have
not
enliven
,
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
think
with
some
bitterness
on
the
power
of
easy
talk
about
trifle
which
some
of
those
he
have
meet
with
at
the
Corneys
'
have
exhibit
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
feel
stir
within
him
a
force
of
endure
love
which
he
believe
to
be
unusual
,
and
which
seem
as
if
it
must
compel
all
thing
to
his
wish
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
a
year
or
so
ago
he
have
think
much
of
his
own
cleverness
and
his
painfully
acquire
learning
,
and
he
have
imagine
that
these
be
the
quality
which
be
to
gain
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
whether
he
have
try
them
and
have
fail
to
win
even
her
admiration
,
or
whether
some
true
instinct
have
tell
him
that
a
woman
's
love
may
be
gain
in
many
way
sooner
than
by
mere
learning
,
he
be
only
angry
with
himself
for
his
past
folly
in
make
himself
her
school
 
nay
,
her
taskmaster
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
though
,
he
would
start
off
on
a
new
tack
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
upbraid
her
for
her
conduct
the
night
before
;
he
have
show
her
his
displeasure
at
the
time
;
but
she
should
see
how
tender
and
forgiving
he
could
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
lure
her
to
him
rather
than
find
fault
with
her
.
<EOS>
there
have
perhaps
be
too
much
of
that
already
.
  
<EOS>
when
Coulson
come
back
Philip
go
to
his
solitary
dinner
.
<EOS>
in
general
he
be
quite
alone
while
eat
it
;
but
to
-
day
Alice
Rose
choose
to
bear
him
company
.
<EOS>
She
watch
him
with
cold
severe
eye
for
some
time
,
until
he
have
appease
his
languid
appetite
.
<EOS>
then
she
begin
with
the
rebuke
she
have
in
store
for
him
;
a
rebuke
the
motive
to
which
be
not
entirely
reveal
even
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
be
none
so
keen
after
thy
food
as
common
,
"
she
begin
.
<EOS>
"
plain
victual
go
ill
down
after
feastin
'
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
feel
the
colour
mount
to
his
face
;
he
be
not
in
the
mood
for
patiently
stand
the
brunt
of
the
attack
which
he
see
be
come
,
and
yet
he
have
a
reverent
feeling
for
woman
and
for
age
.
<EOS>
He
wish
she
would
leave
him
alone
;
but
he
only
say
 
"
I
have
nought
but
a
slice
o
'
cold
beef
for
supper
,
if
you
will
call
that
feasting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
neither
do
godly
way
savour
delicately
after
the
pleasure
of
the
world
,
"
continue
she
,
unheede
his
speech
.
"
<EOS>
Thou

Philip

impatiently
(
both
he
and
Coulson
call
Alice

at
time
)
,
"
I

<EOS>
"
  
"
but
do
not
think
,
mother
,
"
say
Philip
,
his
last
word
of
conciliation
,
for
the
clock
have
give
warning
for
two
,
"
as
I
be
boun

for

just
because
I

<EOS>
,
all
I

"
<EOS>
and
once
more
,
after
lay
his
hand
with
as
much
of
a
caress
as
be
in
his
nature
on
her
,
he
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
probably
Alice
would
have
consider
the
first
word
that
greet
Philip
on
his
entrance
into
the
shop
as
an
answer
to
her
prayer
,
for
they
be
such
as
put
a
stop
to
his
plan
of
go
to
see
Sylvia
that
evening
;
and
if
Alice
have
form
her
inchoate
thought
into
word
,
Sylvia
would
have
appear
as
the
near
earthly
representative
of
the
spirit
of
temptation
whom
she
dread
for
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
take
his
place
behind
the
counter
,
Coulson
say
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
    
"
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
have
be
round
to
bid
us
to
sup
wi
'
him
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
he
and
John
have
a
little
matter
<EOS>
o
'
business
to
talk
over
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
glance
from
his
eye
to
Philip
tell
the
latter
that
Coulson
believe
the
business
speak
of
have
something
to
do
with
the
partnership
,
respect
which
there
have
be
a
silent
intelligence
for
some
time
between
the
shopman
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
thou
say
?
"
ask
Philip
,
doggedly
unwilling
,
even
yet
,
to
give
up
his
purposed
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
!
<EOS>
why
,
what
could
a
say
,
but
that
we
would
come
?
<EOS>
there
be
summat
up
,
for
sure
;
and
summat
as
he
think
we
should
be
glad
on
.
<EOS>
I
could
tell
it
fra
<EOS>
'
t
'
look
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
as
I
can
go
,
"
say
Philip
,
feel
just
then
as
if
the
long
-
hope
-
for
partnership
be
as
nothing
compare
to
his
plan
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
distasteful
to
him
to
have
to
give
up
a
project
,
or
to
disarrange
an
intended
order
of
thing
,
such
be
his
nature
;
but
to
-
day
it
be
absolute
pain
to
yield
his
own
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
man
alive
?
"
say
Coulson
,
in
amaze
at
his
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
I
might
not
go
,
"
say
Philip
,
weigh
consequence
,
until
call
off
to
attend
to
customer
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
,
however
,
he
feel
himself
more
easy
in
defer
his
visit
to
Haytersbank
till
the
next
evening
.
<EOS>
Charley
Kinraid
enter
the
shop
,
accompany
by
Molly
Brunton
and
her
sister
;
and
though
they
all
go
towards
Hester
's
side
of
the
shop
,
and
Philip
and
Coulson
have
many
people
to
attend
to
,
yet
Hepburn
's
sharpen
ear
catch
much
of
what
the
young
woman
be
say
.
<EOS>
from
that
he
gather
that
Kinraid
have
promise
them
new
year
's
gift
,
for
the
purchase
of
which
they
be
come
;
and
after
a
little
more
listening
he
learn
that
Kinraid
be
return
to
Shields
the
next
day
,
have
only
come
over
to
spend
a
holiday
with
his
relation
,
and
be
tie
with
ship
's
work
at
the
other
end
.
<EOS>
They
all
talk
together
lightly
and
merrily
,
as
if
his
go
or
stay
be
almost
a
matter
of
indifference
to
himself
and
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
the
principal
thought
of
the
young
woman
be
to
secure
the
article
they
most
fancy
;
Charley
Kinraid
be
(
so
Philip
think
)
especially
anxious
that
the
young
and
prettiest
should
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
watch
him
perpetually
with
a
kind
of
envy
of
his
bright
,
courteous
manner
,
the
natural
gallantry
of
the
sailor
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
but
clear
that
Sylvia
take
as
little
thought
of
him
as
he
do
of
her
,
to
all
appearance
,
Philip
could
even
have
give
him
praise
for
manly
good
look
,
and
a
certain
kind
of
geniality
of
disposition
which
make
him
ready
to
smile
pleasantly
at
all
stranger
,
from
baby
upwards
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
party
turn
to
leave
the
shop
they
see
Philip
,
the
guest
of
the
night
before
;
and
they
come
over
to
shake
hand
with
him
across
the
counter
;
Kinraid
's
hand
be
proffer
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
last
night
Philip
could
not
have
believe
it
possible
that
such
a
demonstration
of
fellowship
should
have
pass
between
them
;
and
perhaps
there
be
a
slight
hesitation
of
manner
on
his
part
,
for
some
idea
or
remembrance
<EOS>
cross
Kinraid
's
mind
which
bring
a
keen
search
glance
into
the
eye
which
for
a
moment
be
fasten
on
Philip
's
face
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
during
the
very
action
of
hand
-
shaking
,
Philip
feel
a
cloud
come
over
his
face
,
not
alter
or
move
his
feature
,
but
take
light
and
peace
out
of
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
begin
to
say
something
,
and
he
gladly
turn
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
ask
him
why
he
go
away
so
early
,
for
they
have
keep
it
up
for
four
hour
after
he
leave
,
and
last
of
all
,
she
add
(
turn
to
Kinraid
)
,
her
cousin
Charley
have
dance
a
hornpipe
among
the
platter
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
hardly
know
what
he
say
in
reply
,
the
mention
of
that
pas
seul
lift
such
a
weight
off
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
could
smile
now
,
after
his
grave
fashion
,
and
would
have
shake
hand
again
with
Kinraid
have
it
be
require
;
for
it
seem
to
him
that
no
one
,
care
ever
so
little
in
the
way
that
he
do
for
Sylvia
,
could
have
bear
four
mortal
hour
of
a
company
where
she
have
be
,
and
be
not
;
least
of
all
could
have
dance
a
hornpipe
,
either
from
gaiety
of
heart
,
or
even
out
of
complaisance
.
<EOS>
He
feel
as
if
the
yearning
after
the
absent
one
would
have
be
a
weight
to
his
leg
,
as
well
as
to
his
spirit
;
and
he
imagine
that
all
man
be
like
himself
.
    
<EOS>
PARTNERSHIP
  
<EOS>
as
darkness
close
in
,
and
the
New
Year
's
throng
become
scarce
,
Philip
's
hesitation
about
accompany
Coulson
fade
away
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
comfortable
respect
Sylvia
,
and
his
go
to
see
her
may
be
defer
;
and
,
after
all
,
he
feel
that
the
wish
of
his
master
ought
to
be
attend
to
,
and
the
honour
of
an
invitation
to
the
private
house
of
Jeremiah
not
to
be
slight
for
anything
short
of
a
positive
engagement
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
ambitious
man
of
business
exist
strongly
in
Philip
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
to
slight
advance
towards
the
second
great
earthly
object
in
his
life
;
one
also
on
which
the
first
depend
.
  
<EOS>
so
when
the
shop
be
close
,
the
two
set
out
down
Bridge
Street
to
cross
the
river
to
the
house
of
Jeremiah
Foster
.
<EOS>
They
stand
a
moment
on
the
bridge
to
breathe
the
keen
fresh
sea
air
after
their
busy
day
.
<EOS>
the
water
come
down
,
swollen
full
and
dark
,
with
rapid
rush
speed
from
the
snow
-
feed
spring
high
up
on
the
moorland
above
.
<EOS>
the
close
-
packed
house
in
the
old
town
seem
a
cluster
of
white
roof
irregularly
pile
against
the
more
unbroken
white
of
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
light
twinkle
here
and
there
in
the
town
,
and
be
sling
from
stern
and
bow
of
the
ship
in
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
very
still
,
settle
in
for
a
frost
;
so
still
that
all
distant
sound
seem
near
:
the
rumble
of
a
return
cart
in
the
High
Street
,
the
voice
on
board
ship
,
the
closing
of
shutter
and
barring
of
door
in
the
new
town
to
which
they
be
bind
.
<EOS>
but
the
sharp
air
be
fill
,
as
it
be
,
with
saline
particle
in
a
freezing
state
;
little
pungent
crystal
of
sea
salt
burn
lip
and
cheek
with
their
cold
keenness
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
to
linger
here
in
the
very
centre
of
the
valley
up
which
pass
the
current
of
atmosphere
come
straight
with
the
rushing
tide
from
the
icy
northern
sea
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
the
unusual
honour
of
a
supper
with
Jeremiah
Foster
await
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
each
of
them
separately
to
a
meal
before
now
;
but
they
have
never
go
together
,
and
they
feel
that
there
be
something
serious
in
the
conjuncture
.
  
<EOS>
They
begin
to
climb
the
steep
height
lead
to
the
freshly
-
build
row
of
the
new
town
of
Monkshaven
,
feel
as
if
they
be
rise
into
aristocratic
region
where
no
shop
profane
the
street
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
's
house
be
one
of
six
,
undistinguished
in
size
,
or
shape
,
or
colour
;
but
notice
in
the
daytime
by
all
passer
-
by
for
its
spotless
cleanliness
of
lintel
and
doorstep
,
window
and
window
frame
.
<EOS>
the
very
brick
seem
as
though
they
come
in
for
the
daily
scrubbing
which
brightened
handle
,
knocker
,
all
down
to
the
very
scraper
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
young
man
feel
as
shy
of
the
interview
with
their
master
under
such
unusual
relation
of
guest
and
host
,
as
a
girl
do
of
her
first
party
.
<EOS>
each
rather
draw
back
from
the
decide
step
of
knock
at
the
door
;
but
with
a
rebuffing
shake
at
his
own
folly
,
Philip
be
the
one
to
give
a
loud
single
rap
.
<EOS>
as
if
they
have
be
wait
for
,
the
door
fly
open
,
and
a
middle
-
aged
servant
stand
behind
,
as
spotless
and
neat
as
the
house
itself
;
and
smile
a
welcome
to
the
familiar
face
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
in
the
square
parlour
the
same
precise
order
be
observe
.
<EOS>
every
article
of
furniture
be
free
from
speck
of
dirt
or
particle
of
dust
;
and
everything
be
place
either
in
a
parallel
line
,
or
at
exact
right

angle
with
every
other
.
<EOS>
even
John
and
Jeremiah
sit
in
symmetry
on
opposite
side
of
the
fire
-
place
;
the
very
smile
on
their
honest
face
seem
draw
to
a
line
of
exactitude
.
  
<EOS>
such
formality
,
however
admirable
,
be
not
calculate
to
promote
ease
:
it
be
not
until
after
supper
 
until
a
good
quantity
of
Yorkshire
pie
have
be
swallow
,
and
wash
down
,
too
,
with
the
good
and
most
generous
wine
in
Jeremiah
's
cellar
 
that
there
be
the
least
geniality
among
them
,
in
spite
of
the
friendly
kindness
of
the
host
and
his
brother
.
<EOS>
the
long
silence
,
during
which
mute
thank
for
the
meal
be
give
,
have
come
to
an
end
,
Jeremiah
call
for
pipe
,
and
three
of
the
party
begin
to
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
politic
in
those
day
be
tickle
subject
to
meddle
with
,
even
in
the
most
private
company
.
<EOS>
the
nation
be
in
a
state
of
terror
against
France
,
and
against
any
at
home
who
may
be
suppose
to
sympathise
with
the
enormity
she
have
just
be
commit
.
<EOS>
the
oppressive
act
against
seditious
meeting
have
be
pass
the
year
before
;
and
people
be
doubtful
to
what
extremity
of
severity
it
may
be
construe
.
<EOS>
even
the
law
authority
forget
to
be
impartial
,
but
either
their
alarm
or
their
interest
make
too
many
of
them
vehement
partisan
instead
of
calm
arbiter
,
and
thus
destroy
the
popular
confidence
in
what
should
have
be
consider
the
supreme
tribunal
of
justice
.
<EOS>
yet
for
all
this
,
there
be
some
who
dare
to
speak
of
reform
of
Parliament
,
as
a
preliminary
step
to
fair
representation
of
the
people
,
and
to
a
reduction
of
the
heavy
war
-
taxation
that
be
imminent
,
if
not
already
impose
.
<EOS>
but
these
pioneer
of
1830
be
generally
obnoxious
.
<EOS>
the
great
body
of
the
people
glory
in
be
Tories
and
hater
of
the
French
,
with
whom
they
be
on
tenter
-
hook
to
fight
,
almost
unaware
of
the
rise
reputation
of
the
young
corsican
warrior
,
whose
name
would
be
use
ere
<EOS>
a
dozen
year
have
pass
to
hush
english
baby
with
a
terror
such
as
that
of
Marlborough
once
have
for
the
French
.
  
<EOS>
at
such
a
place
as
Monkshaven
all
these
opinion
be
hold
in
excess
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
might
,
for
the
mere
sake
of
argument
,
dispute
on
certain
point
of
history
or
government
;
but
they
take
care
to
be
very
sure
of
their
listener
before
such
argument
touch
on
anything
of
the
present
day
;
for
it
have
be
not
unfrequently
find
that
the
public
duty
of
prosecute
opinion
not
your
own
overrode
the
private
duty
of
respect
confidence
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
Monkshaven
politician
confine
themselves
,
therefore
,
to
such
general
question
as
these
:
"
Could
an
Englishman
lick
more
than
four
frenchman
at
a
time
?
"
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
proper
punishment
for
member
of
the
Corresponding
Society
(
correspondence

the
french
directory
)
,
hang

or
burn

"
<EOS>
"
Would
the
forthcoming
child
of
the
Princess
of
Wales
be
a
boy
or
a

?
<EOS>
if
a
girl
,
would
it
be
more
loyal
to
call
it
Charlotte

Elizabeth
?

<EOS>
the
foster
be
quite
secure
enough
of
their
guest
this
evening
to
have
speak
freely
on
politic

they

<EOS>
and
they

then
the
conversation
die
away
to
an
ominous
silence
.
<EOS>
John
look
at
Jeremiah
,
as
if
ask
him
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
be
the
host
,
and
have
be
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
return
the
look
with
the
same
meaning
in
it
.
<EOS>
John
,
though
a
bachelor
,
be
the
eld
brother
.
<EOS>
the
great
church
bell
,
bring
from
the
Monkshaven
monastery
century
ago
,
high
up
on
the
opposite
hill
-
side
,
begin
to
ring
nine
o'clock
;
it
be
get
late
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
begin
:
  
"
It
seem
a
bad
time
for
start
any
one
on
business
,
wi
'
price
and
taxis
and
bread
so
dear
;
but
John
and
I
be
get
into
year
,
and
we
have
no
child
to
follow
us
:
yet
we
would
fain
draw
out
of
some
of
our
worldly
affair
.
<EOS>
We
would
like
to
give
up
the
shop
,
and
stick
to
banking
,
to
which
there
seemeth
a
plain
path
.
<EOS>
but
first
there
be
the
stock
and
goodwill
of
the
shop
to
be
dispose
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
dead
pause
.
<EOS>
this
opening
be
not
favourable
to
the
hope
of
the
two
moneyless
young
man
who
have
be
hope
to
succeed
their
master
by
the
more
gradual
process
of
partnership
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
the
kind
of
speech
that
have
be
agree
upon
by
the
two
brother
with
a
view
of
impress
on
Hepburn
and
Coulson
the
great
and
unusual
responsibility
of
the
situation
into
which
the
foster
wish
them
to
enter
.
<EOS>
in
some
way
the
talk
of
many
be
much
less
simple
and
straightforward
in
those
day
than
it
be
now
.
<EOS>
the
study
of
effect
show
in
the
London
diner
-
out
of
the
last
generation
,
who
prepare
their
conversation
beforehand
,
be
not
without
its
parallel
in
humbler
sphere
,
and
for
different
object
than
self
-
display
.
<EOS>
the
brother
Foster
have
all
but
rehearse
the
speech
they
be
about
to
make
this
evening
.
<EOS>
They
be
aware
of
the
youth
of
the
party
to
whom
they
be
go
to
make
a
most
favourable
proposal
;
and
they
dread
that
if
that
proposal
be
too
lightly
make
,
it
would
be
too
lightly
consider
,
and
the
duty
involve
in
it
too
carelessly
enter
upon
.
<EOS>
so
the
_
role
_
of
one
brother
be
to
suggest
,
that
of
the
other
to
repress
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
,
too
,
have
their
reserve
.
<EOS>
They
foresaw
,
and
have
long
foresee
<EOS>
,
what
be
come
that
evening
.
<EOS>
They
be
impatient
to
hear
it
in
distinct
word
;
and
yet
they
have
to
wait
,
as
if
unconscious
,
during
all
the
long
preamble
.
<EOS>
do
age
and
youth
never
play
the
same
part
now
?
<EOS>
to
return
.
<EOS>
John
Foster
reply
to
his
brother
:
  
"
the
stock
and
goodwill
!
<EOS>
that
would
take
much
wealth
.
<EOS>
and
there
will
be
fixture
to
be
consider
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
canst
thee
tell
me
the
exact
amount
of
stock
in
the
shop
at
present
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
only
just
be
take
;
Philip
have
it
at
his
finger
'
end
.
<EOS>
"
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
forty
-
one
pound
,
thirteen
shilling
and
twopence
.
"
  
Coulson
look
at
him
in
a
little
dismay
,
and
could
not
repress
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
the
figure
put
into
word
and
speak
aloud
seem
to
indicate
so
much
large
an
amount
of
money
than
when
quickly
write
down
in
numeral
.
<EOS>
but
Philip
read
the
countenance
,
nay
,
by
some
process
of
which
he
be
not
himself
aware
<EOS>
,
he
read
the
mind
of
the
brother
,
and
feel
no
dismay
at
what
he
see
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
fixture
?
<EOS>
"
ask
John
Foster
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
appraiser
value
them
at
four
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
pound
three
and
sixpence
when
father
die
.
<EOS>
We
have
add
to
them
since
,
but
we
will
reckon
them
at
that
.
<EOS>
how
much
do
that
make
with
the
value
of
the
stock
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
six
pound
,
sixteen
shilling
and
eightpence
,
"
say
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Coulson
have
do
the
sum
quicker
,
but
be
too
much
dishearten
by
the
amount
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
goodwill
?
"
ask
the
pitiless
John
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
dost
thee
set
that
at
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
brother
,
that
that
would
depend
on
who
come
forward
with
the
purchase
-
money
of
the
stock
and
fixture
.
<EOS>
to
some
folk
we
may
make
it
sit
easy
,
if
they
be
know
to
us
,
and
those
as
we
wish
well
to
.
<EOS>
if
Philip
and
William
here
,
for
instance
,
say
they
would
like
to
purchase
the
business
,
I
reckon
thee
and
<EOS>
me
would
not
ask
'em
so
much
as
we
should
ask
Millers
'
(
miller
be
an
upstart
petty
rival
shop
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
in
the
New
Town
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Philip
and
William
be
to
come
after
us
,
"
say
John
.
<EOS>
"
but
that
be
out
of
the
question
,
"
he
continue
,
know
all
the
while
that
,
far
from
be
out
of
the
question
,
it
be
the
very
question
,
and
that
it
be
as
good
as
settle
at
this
very
time
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
speak
.
<EOS>
then
Jeremiah
go
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
It
be
out
of
the
question
,
I
reckon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
two
young
man
.
<EOS>
Coulson
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
Philip
more
bravely
say
,
    
"
I
have
fifty
-
three
pound
seven
and
fourpence
in
yo'r
hand
,
Master
John
,

it
be
all
I
have
<EOS>
i

the
world

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
,
"
say
John
,
and
again
they
be
silent
.
<EOS>
half
-
past
nine
strike
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
to
be
begin
to
make
an
end
.
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
brother
,
they
have
friend
who
could
advance
'em
the
money
.
<EOS>
We
may
make
it
sit
light
to
them
,
for
the
sake
of
their
good
service
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
reply
,
    
"
there
be
no
one
who
can
put
forwards
a
penny
for
me
:
<EOS>
I
have
but
few
kin
,

they
have
little
to
spare
beyond
what
they
need

<EOS>
Coulson

"
My

have
nine
on
us

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
alone
,
let
alone
!
"
say
John
,
relent
fast
;
for
he
be
weary
of
his
part
of
cold
,
stern
prudence
.
<EOS>
"
brother
,
I
think
we
have
enough
of
this
world

good
to
do
what

"
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
be
a
little
scandalized
at
the
rapid
melting
away
of
assumed
character
,
and
take
a
good
pull
at
his
pipe
before
he
reply
    
<EOS>
"
Upwards
of
two
thousand
pound
be
a
large
sum
to
set
on
the
well

being

doing
of
two
lad
,
the
elder
of
whom
be
not

<EOS>
I
fear
we
must
look
farther
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
John
,
"
reply
Jeremiah
,
"
it
be
but
yesterday
thee
saidst
thee
would
rather
have
Philip

William

any

now
to

t

thou

thou

<EOS>
but
I
think
as
I
must
have
security
for
my

for
it
be
a

<EOS>
a
great

<EOS>
have
ye
any

<EOS>
any

<EOS>
no
;
neither
of
them
have
.
<EOS>
so
Jeremiah
rejoin
    
"
<EOS>
then
,
I
suppose
,
I
mun
do
as
thee
dost
,
John
,
and
take
the
security
of
character

it
be
a
great

t

<EOS>
good
o

all

one
that
I
could
not

<EOS>
no

not
if
yo'd
pay
me
down
five
thousand

<EOS>
for
John
Foster

more

<EOS>
I
dunnot
think
there
be
a

dead
,
for
that
matter
 
as
can
say
foster
wrong
him
of
a
penny
,
or
give
short
measure
to
a

a
Cousin
Betty

<EOS>
They
all
four
shake
hand
round
with
the

heartiness
as
if
it
have
be
a
legal
ceremony
necessary
to
the
completion

say
Jeremiah

Yo're

us
for

put
on

now

"
We

for

the

They
be
afraid

Hepburn

be
dazzle
by
the
amount

have
so
arrange
the
slide

scale

payment
as
to
reduce
the
first
year
's
income
to
what
the
eld
man
think
a
very
moderate
sum
,
but
what
to
the
young
one
appear
an
amount
of
wealth
such
as
they
,
who
have
neither
of
them
ever
own
much
more
than
fifty

,
consider
almost
inexhaustible

<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
remarkable
instance
of
prosperity
and
desert
meet
together
so
early
in

for
a
moment

the

be
disappoint
at
not

<EOS>
then
Philip
stand
up

he
feel
as
if
anything
he

sit
down
would
not

William

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
anyhow
,
it

late
J.

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
William

John
Foster
,
highly
gratified
,
"
there
be
time
enough

over
that

<EOS>
there
be
one
thing
more
to
be
say
,
be
there
not
,
brother
Jeremiah
?
<EOS>
We
do
not
wish
to
have
this
talk
over
in
Monkshaven
until
shortly
before
the
time
when
yo
'
must
enter
on
the
business
.
<EOS>
We
have
our
own
arrangement
to
make
wi
'
regard
to
the
banking
concern
,
and
there
will
be
lawyer
's
work
to
do
,
after
yo've
examine
book
and
look
over
stock
again
together
;
may
-
be
we
have
overstate
it
,
or
t
'
fixture
be
not
worth
so
much
as
we
say
.
<EOS>
anyhow
yo
'
must
each
on
yo
'
give
us
yo'r
word
for
to
keep
fra
'
name
this
night
's
conversation
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
Jeremiah
and
I
will
have
to
pay
account
,
and
take
a
kind
of
farewell
of
the
merchant
and
manufacturer
with
whom
foster
have
have
dealing
this
seventy
or
eighty
year
;
and
when
and
where
it
seem
fitting
to
us
we
will
take
one
of
yo
'
to
introduce
as
our
successor
and
friend
.
<EOS>
but
all
that
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
yo
'
must
each
give
us
yo'r
word
not
to
name
what
have
pass
here
to
any
one
till
further
speech
on
the
subject
have
pass
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
immediately
give
the
promise
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
assent
come
lag
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
of
Sylvia
live
,
almost
as
much
as
of
the
dead
mother
,
whose
last
word
have
be
a
committal
of
her
child
to
the
Father
of
the
friendless
;
and
now
that
a
short
delay
be
place
between
the
sight
of
the
cup
and
his
enjoyment
of
it
,
there
be
an
impatient
chafing
in
the
mind
of
the
composed
and
self
-
restrain
Philip
;
and
then
repentance
quick
as
lightning
efface
the
feeling
,
and
he
pledge
himself
to
the
secrecy
which
be
enjoin
.
<EOS>
some
few
more
detail
as
to
their
mode
of
procedure
 
of
verify
the
foster
'
statement
,
which
to
the
young
man
seem
a
perfectly
unnecessary
piece
of
business
 
of
probable
journey
and
introduction
,
and
then
farewell
be
bidden
,
and
Hepburn
and
Coulson
be
in
the
passage
don
their
wrap
,
and
rather
to
their
indignation
be
assist
therein
by
Martha
,
who
be
accustom
to
the
office
with
her
own
master
.
<EOS>
suddenly
they
be
recall
into
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
John
Foster
be
fumble
with
the
paper
a
little
nervously
:
Jeremiah
speak
    
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
think
it
necessary
to
commend
Hester
Rose
to
you
;
if
she
have
be
a
lad
she
would
have
have
a
third
o
'
the
business
along
wi
'
yo
'
.
<EOS>
be
a
woman
,
it
be
ill
trouble
her
with
a
partnership
;
better
give
her
a
fix
salary
till
such
time
as
she
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
a
little
knowingly
and
curiously
at
the
face
of
the
young
man
he
address
.
<EOS>
William
Coulson
seem
sheepish
and
uncomfortable
,
but
say
nothing
,
leave
it
as
usual
to
Philip
to
be
spokesman
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
have
not
care
for
Hester
for
hersel
'
,
master
,
we
should
ha
'
care
for
her
as
be
forespeak
by
yo
'
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
and
Master
John
shall
fix
what
we
ought
t
'
pay
her
;
and
I
think
I
may
make
bold
to
say
that
,
as
our
income
rise
,
her
shall
too
 
eh
,
Coulson
?
"
(
a
sound
of
assent
quite
distinct
enough
)
;
"
for
we
both
look
on
her
as
a
sister
and
on
Alice
like
a
mother
,
as
I
tell
her
only
this
very
day
.
"
      
<EOS>
a
DIFFICULT
question
  
<EOS>
Philip
go
to
bed
with
that
kind
of
humble
penitent
gratitude
in
his
heart
,
which
we
sometimes
feel
after
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
from
despondency
to
hope
.
<EOS>
the
night
before
it
seem
as
if
all
event
be
so
arrange
as
to
thwart
him
in
his
dear
wish
;
he
feel
now
as
if
his
discontent
and
repine
,
not
twenty
-
four
hour
before
,
have
be
almost
impious
,
<EOS>
so
great
be
the
change
in
his
circumstance
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
now
all
seem
promising
for
the
fulfilment
of
what
he
most
desire
.
<EOS>
He
be
almost
convinced
that
he
be
mistaken
in
think
that
Kinraid
have
have
anything
more
than
a
sailor
's
admiration
for
a
pretty
girl
with
regard
to
Sylvia
;
at
any
rate
,
he
be
go
away
to
-
morrow
,
in
all
probability
not
to
return
for
another
year
(
for
Greenland
ship
leave
for
the
northern
sea
as
soon
as
there
be
a
chance
of
the
ice
be
break
up
)
,
and
ere
then
he
himself
may
speak
out
openly
,
lay
before
her
parent
all
his
fortunate
prospect
,
and
before
her
all
his
deep
passionate
love
.
  
<EOS>
so
this
night
his
prayer
be
more
than
the
mere
form
that
they
have
be
the
night
before
;
they
be
a
vehement
expression
of
gratitude
to
God
for
have
,
as
it
be
,
interfere
on
his
behalf
,
to
grant
him
the
desire
of
his
eye
and
the
lust
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
be
like
too
many
of
us
,
he
do
not
place
his
future
life
in
the
hand
of
God
,
and
only
ask
for
grace
to
do
His
will
in
whatever
circumstance
may
arise
;
but
he
yearn
in
that
terrible
way
after
a
blessing
which
,
when
grant
under
such
circumstance
,
too
often
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
curse
.
<EOS>
and
that
spirit
bring
with
it
the
material
and
earthly
idea
that
all
event
that
favour
our
wish
be
answer
to
our
prayer
;
and
so
they
be
in
one
sense
,
but
they
need
prayer
in
a
deep
and
high
spirit
to
keep
us
from
the
temptation
to
evil
which
such
event
invariably
bring
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
little
know
how
Sylvia
's
time
have
be
pass
that
day
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
,
he
would
have
lay
down
this
night
with
even
a
heavy
heart
than
he
have
do
on
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
Charley
Kinraid
accompany
his
cousin
as
far
as
the
spot
where
the
path
to
Haytersbank
Farm
diverge

then

stop
his
merry
talk
,
and
announce
his
intention
of

Haytersbank
be
close
for
the
night
as
far
as
it
ever
be
close
;
there
be
no
shutter
to

nor
do

asleep

there
be
the
intermittent
sound
of
the
sharp
whistling
of
milk
into

pail

and
Kester
,

three

in

laugh
at

futile
endeavour

find
quite
enough
to
do
with

untouched

unexpectedly

anxious
to
make
her
quite
at

conciliate
Kester

he
address
his

Sylvia

knit
away
vigorously

all
the
while
that
it
be
a
great
pity
she
have
not
put
on
a
well
gown
,
or
even
a
cap
with
bright
ribbon
,
and
quite
unconscious
how
very
pretty
she
look
stand
against
the
faint
light
<EOS>
,
her
head
<EOS>
a
little
bent
down
;
her
hair
catch
bright
golden
touch
,
as
it
fall
from
under
her
little
linen
cap
;
her
pink
bed
-
gown
,
confine
by
her
apron
-
string
,
give
a
sort
of
easy
grace
to
her
figure
;
her
dark
full
linsey
petticoat
short
above
her
trim
ancle
,
look
far
more
suitable
to
the
place
where
she
be
stand
than
her
long
gown
of
the
night
before
would
have
do
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
be
want
to
talk
to
her
,
and
to
make
her
talk
,
but
be
uncertain
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Kester
go
on
with
the
subject
last
speak
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
Black
Nell

so
she

She

"
  
<EOS>
"
do

many
a

Sylvia

a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
when
we
be

,
I
help
Kester
;
but
now
we
have
only
Black
Nell

Daisy

milk
.
<EOS>
Kester
know
as
I
can
milk
Black
Nell
quite
easy
,
"
she
continue
,
half
vexed
that
Kester
have
not

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I

I

<EOS>
"
to

say
Sylvia
,
suddenly
look
up
at
him
,
and
then
drop
her
eye
,
as
she
find
he
have
be
watch
for
the
effect

I

be
on

spot
for

after

.
<EOS>
maybe
I
shall
take
a
run
down
here
afore
sailing
in
March
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
shall
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
mean
and
understand
by
these
last
few
word
.
<EOS>
the
tone
in
which
they
be
speak
give
them
a
tender
intensity
not
lose
upon
either
of
the
hearer
.
<EOS>
Kester
cock
his
eye
once
more
,
but
with
as
little
obtrusiveness
as
he
could
,
and
ponder
the
sailor
's
look
and
way
.
<EOS>
He
remember
his
come
about
the
place
the
winter
before
,
and
how
the
old
master
have
then
appear
to
have
take
to
him
;
but
at
that
time
Sylvia
have
seem
to
Kester
too
little
remove
from
a
child
to
have
either
art
or
part
in
Kinraid
's
visit
;
now
,
however
,
the
case
be
different
.
<EOS>
Kester
in
his
sphere
 
among
his
circle
of
acquaintance
,
narrow
though
it
be
 
have
hear
with
much
pride
of
Sylvia
's
bear
away
the
bell
at
church
and
at
market
,
wherever
girl
of
her
age
be
congregate
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
north
countryman
,
so
he
give
out
no
further
sign
of
his
feeling
than
his
mistress
and
Sylvia
's
mother
have
do
on
a
like
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
lass
be
weel
enough
,
"
say
he
;
but
he
grin
to
himself
,
and
look
about
,
and
listen
to
the
hearsay
of
every
lad
,
wonder
who
be
handsome
,
and
brave
,
and
good
enough
to
be
Sylvia
's
mate
.
<EOS>
now
,
of
late
,
it
have
seem
to
the
canny
farm
-
servant
pretty
clear
that
Philip
Hepburn
be
"
after
her
"
;
and
to
Philip
,
Kester
have
an
instinctive
objection
,
a
kind
of
natural
antipathy
such
as
have
exist
in
all
age
between
the
dweller
in
a
town
and
those
in
the
country
,
between
agriculture
and
trade
.
<EOS>
so
,
while
Kinraid
and
Sylvia
keep
up
their
half
-
tender
,
half
-
jest
conversation
,
Kester
be
make
up
his
slow
persistent
mind
as
to
the
desirability
of
the
young
man
then
present
as
a
husband
for
his
darling
,
as
much
from
his
be
other
than
Philip
in
every
respect
,
as
from
the
individual
good
quality
he
possess
.
<EOS>
Kester
's
first
opportunity
of
favour
Kinraid
's
suit
consist
in
be
as
long
as
possible
over
his
milking
;
so
never
be
cow
that
require
such
"
strip
,
"
or
be
expect
to
yield
such
"
aftering
"
,
as
Black
Nell
and
Daisy
that
night
.
<EOS>
but
all
thing
must
come
to
an
end
;
and
at
length
Kester
get
up
from
his
three
-
legged
stool
,
on
see
what
the
other
do
not
 
that
the
dip
-
candle
in
the
lantern
be
come
to
an
end
 
and
that
in
two
or
three
minute
more
the
shippen
would
be
in
darkness
,
and
so
his
pail
of
milk
be
endanger
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
Sylvia
have
start
out
of
her
delicious
dreamland
,
her
drooping
eye
be
raise
,
and
recover
their
power
of
observation
;
her
ruddy
arm
be
free
from
the
apron
in
which
she
have
enfold
them
,
as
a
protection
from
the
gathering
cold
,
and
she
have
seize
and
adjust
the
wooden
yoke
across
her
shoulder
,
ready
to
bear
the
brim
milk
-
pail
to
the
dairy
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
yo
'
at
her
!
"
exclaim
Kester
to
Charley
,
as
he
adjust
the
fragrant
pail
on
the
yoke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
think
she
be
missu
a
ready
,
and
she
be
allay
for
carry
in
t

milk
since

i

back

;
and
when
she
say
"
yea
,
"
it
be
as
much
as
my
heed
be
worth
to
say
"
Nay
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
along
the
wall
,
round
the
corner
,
down
the
round
slippery
stone
of
the
rambling
farmyard
,
behind
the
building
,
do
Sylvia
trip
,
safe
and
well
-
poise
,
though
the
ground
wear
all
one
coating
of
white
snow
,
and
in
many
place
be
so
slippery
as
to
oblige
Kinraid
to
linger
near
Kester
,
the
lantern
-
bearer
.
<EOS>
Kester
do
not
lose
his
opportunity
,
though
the
cold
misty
night
air
provoke
his
asthmatic
cough
when
-
ever
he
breathe
,
and
often
interrupt
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
A've

she

down

"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
reach
the
back
-
kitchen
door
,
just
as
Sylvia
have
unladen
herself
,
and
be
strike
a
light
with
flint
and
tinder
.
<EOS>
the
house
seem
warm
and
inviting
after
the
pierce
outer
air
,
although
the
kitchen
into
which
they
enter
contain
only
a
raked
and
slumbering
fire
at
one
end
,
over
which
,
on
a
crook
,
hang
the
immense
pan
of
potato
cook
for
the
evening
meal
of
the
pig
.
<EOS>
to
this
pan
Kester
immediately
address
himself
,
swinge
it
round
with
ease
,
owe
to
the
admirable
simplicity
of
the
old
-
fashioned
machinery
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
stand
between
Kester
and
the
door
into
the
dairy
,
through
which
Sylvia
have
vanish
with
the
milk
.
<EOS>
He
half
wish
to
conciliate
Kester
by
help
him
,
but
he
seem
also
attract
,
by
a
force
which
annihilate
his
will
,
to
follow
her
wherever
she
go
.
<EOS>
Kester
read
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
alone
,
let
alone
,
"
say
he
;
"
pig
'
vittle
take
noan
such
dainty

as

<EOS>
a
may
set
it
down
an

;
she
be
noan
fit

<EOS>
'
other

mester
;
better
help
her
t
'
teem
t

"
  
<EOS>
so
Kinraid
follow
the
light
 
his
light
 
into
the
icy
chill
of
the
dairy
,
where
the
bright
polished
tin
can
be
quickly
dim
with
the
warm
,
sweet
-
smell
milk
,
that
Sylvia
be
empty
out
into
the
brown
pan
.
<EOS>
in
his
haste
to
help
her
,
Charley
take
up
one
of
the
pail
.
  
<EOS>
"
eh
?
that'n
's
to

<EOS>
Yo

<EOS>
Mother

very
particular
,
and

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
go
over
to
her
awkward
dairymaid
,
and
before
she
 
but
not
before
he
 
be
aware
of
the
sweet
proximity
,
she
be
adjust
his
happy
awkward
arm
to
the
new
office
of
hold
a
milk
-
strainer
over
the
bowl
,
and
pour
the
white
liquid
through
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
say
she
,
look
up
for
a
moment
,
and
half
blushing
;
"
now
yo'll
know
how
to
do
it
next
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
next
time
be
to
come
now
,
"
say
Kinraid
;
but
she
have
return
to
her
own
pail
,
and
seem
not
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
He
follow
her
to
her
side
of
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
a
short
memory
,
can
yo

me
again
how

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
she
,
half
laughing
,
but
hold
her
strainer
fast
in
spite
of
his
insinuate
effort
to
unlock
her
finger
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
no
need
to

yo've
getten
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
how
dun
you
know
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
last
night
,
"
she
begin
,
and
then
she
stop
,
and
turn
away
her
head
,
pretend
to
be
busy
in
her
dairy
duty
of
rinse
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
he
,
half
conjecture
her
meaning
,
and
flatter
by
it
,
if
his
conjecture
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
last
night
 
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yo

know
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
as
if
impatient
at
be
both
literally
and
metaphorically
follow
about
,
and
drive
into
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
tell
me
,
"
persist
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
if
yo

will
have
it
,
I
think
yo

show
yo'd
but
a
short
memory
when
yo

do
not
know
me
again
,
and
yo
'
be
five
time
at
this
house
last
winter
,
and
that
be
not
so
long
sin
'
.
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
yo
'
see
a
vast
o
'
thing
on
yo'r
voyage
by
land
or
by
sea
,
and
then
it
be
<EOS>
but
natural
yo

should
forget
.
"
<EOS>
She
wish
she
could
go
on
talk
,
but
could
not
think
of
anything
more
to
say
just
then
;
for
,
in
the
middle
of
her
sentence
,
the
flattering
interpretation
he
may
put
upon
her
word
,
on
her
know
so
exactly
the
number
of
time
he
have
be
to
Haytersbank
,
flash
upon
her
,
and
she
want
to
lead
the
conversation
a
little
farther
afield
 
to
make
it
a
little
less
personal
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
his
wish
,
however
.
<EOS>
in
a
tone
which
thrill
through
her
,
even
in
her
own
despite
,
he
say
,
    
"
do
yo
'
think
that
can
ever
happen
again
,
Sylvia
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
quite
silent
;
almost
tremble
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
the
question
as
if
to
force
her
to
answer
.
<EOS>
drive
to
bay
,
she
equivocate
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
happen
again
?
<EOS>
let
me
go
,
I
dunno
what
yo're
talk
about
,
and
I
be
a'most
numbed
wi
'
cold
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
the
frosty
air
come
sharp
in
through
the
open
lattice
window
,
and
the
ice
be
already
form
on
the
milk
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
would
have
find
a
ready
way
of
keep
his
cousin
,
or
indeed
most
young
woman
,
warm
;
but
he
pause
before
he
dare
put
his
arm
round
Sylvia
;
she
have
something
so
shy
and
wild
in
her
look
and
manner
;
and
her
very
innocence
of
what
her
word
,
speak
by
another
girl
,
may
lead
to
,
inspire
him
with
respect
,
and
keep
him
in
check
.
<EOS>
so
he
content
himself
with
say
,
    
"
I
will
let
yo
'
go
into
t
'
warm
kitchen
if
yo'll
tell
me
<EOS>
if
yo
'
think
I
can
ever
forget
yo
'
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
defiantly
,
and
set
her
red
lip
firm
.
<EOS>
He
enjoy
her
determination
not
to
reply
to
this
question
;
it
show
she
feel
its
significance
.
<EOS>
Her
pure
eye
look
steadily
into
his
;
nor
be
the
expression
in
his
such
as
to
daunt
her
or
make
her
afraid
.
<EOS>
They
be
like
two
child
defy
each
other
;
each
determine
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
unclose
her
lip
,
and
nod
her

<EOS>
perhaps
the
fresh
voice
break
on
the
silence
,
 
perhaps
the
tone
be
less
modulated
than
they
have
be
before
,
but
anyhow
Bell
Robson
's
voice
be
hear
call
Sylvia
through
the
second
door
,
which
open
from
the
dairy
to
the
house

place
,
in
which
her
mother
have
be
till
this
moment
asleep

<EOS>
Sylvia
dart
off
in
obedience
to
the
call
;
glad
to
leave
him
,
as
at
the
moment
Kinraid
resentfully
imagine
.
<EOS>
through
the
open
door
he
hear
the
conversation
between
mother
and
daughter
,
almost
unconscious
of
its
meaning
,
so
difficult
do
he
find
it
to
wrench
his
thought
from
the
idea
he
have
just
be
form
with
Sylvia
's
bright
lovely
face
right
under
his
eye

<EOS>
"
Sylvia

her
mother

"
who

yonder
?
<EOS>
"
Bell
be
sit
up
in
the
attitude
of
one
startle
out
of
slumber
into
intensity
of
listen
;
her
hand
on
each
of
the
chair
-
arm
,
as
if
just
go
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a

I
heerd
his
voice

<EOS>
"
It
be
only
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
Charley

he

last
night

Sylvia
,
conscious
that
he
could
overhear
every
word
that
be

,
and
a
little
suspecting
that
he
be
no
great
favourite
with
her
mother

on

when

<EOS>
but
now
Kinraid
come
in
,
feel
the
awkwardness
of
his
situation
a
little
,
yet
with
an
expression
so
pleasant
and
manly
in
his
open
face
,
and
in
his
exculpatory
manner
,
that
Sylvia
lose
his
first
word
in
a
strange
kind
of
pride
of
possession
in
him
,
about
which
she
do
not
reason
nor
care
to
define
the
ground

<EOS>
but
her
mother
rise
from
her
chair
somewhat
formally
,
as
if
she
do
not
intend
to
sit
down
again
while
he
stay
,
yet
be
too
weak
to
be
keep
in
that
stand
attitude
long

I

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
for
it
after
this
but
to
go
.
<EOS>
His
only
comfort
be
that
on
Sylvia
's
rosy
face
he
could
read
unmistakable
sign
of
regret
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
His
sailor
's
life

in
bring
him
suddenly
face
to
face
with
unexpected
event
,
have
give
him
something
of
that
self

possession
which
we
consider
the
attribute
of
a
gentleman
;
and
with
an
apparent
calmness
which
almost
disappoint
Sylvia
,
who
construe
it
into
a
symptom
of
indifference
as
to
whether
he
go

stay

he
bid
her
mother
good

night

He
speak
low

her

be
rearrange
herself
in

else
Sylvia
would
have
have
to
repeat
the
previous
word

<EOS>
as
it
be
,
with
soft
thrilling
idea
ring
through
her
,
she
could
get
her
wheel
,
and
sit
down
to
her
spinning
by
the
fire
;
wait
for
her
mother
to
speak
first
,
Sylvia
dream
her
dream

<EOS>
Bell
Robson
be
partly
aware
of
the
state
of
thing
,
as
far
as
it
lie
on
the
surface

She
be
not
aware
how
deep
down
certain
feeling

penetrate
into
the

heart
who

Bell
look
upon
Sylvia
as
still
a
child
,
to
be
warn
off
forbidden
thing
by
threat
of
danger

the
forbid
thing
be
already
taste

possible
danger

Her

feature

She

a
clean
buff
kerchief

into

dark
blue

consideration
she

it
busily
clink
in

<EOS>
but
she
have
something
quite
beyond
common
to
think
about
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
speak
about
;

for
the
minute

just
to

he
go
away

It

I

from

it

<EOS>
and
when
they
scold
her

pretty

she
would
stand
up

put
her

at

at

they

many
a

down

beat
her

any
peace

<EOS>
It
be
a
caution

It

that

the
hard
frost
which
begin
on
new

eve
last
on

on
into
late
February
,
black
and
bitter

but
welcome
enough
to
the
farmer

as
it
keep
back
the
too
early
growth
of
autumn
-
sow
wheat

give
them
the
opportunity

lead
manure

it
do
not
suit
invalid

well

any

amendment

always
centre
on
Charley
Kinraid

his
way

his
word

his
look

whether
they
all
mean
what
she
would
fain
believe
they

whether

mean
love
at
the

such
a
feeling
be
likely
to
endure

<EOS>
Her
mother
's
story
of
crazy
Nancy
have
take
hold
of
her
;

not
as
a
"
caution
,
"
rather
as
a
parallel
case
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
like
Nancy
,
and
borrow
the
poor
girl
's
own
word
,
she
would
say
softly
to
herself
,
"
He
once
be
here
"
;
but
all
along
she
believe
in
her
heart
he
would
come
back
again
to
her

though
it
touch
her
strangely
to
imagine
the
agony
of
forsaken
love

<EOS>
Philip
know
little
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
busy
with
fact
and
figure
,
doggedly
fight
through
the
necessary
business
,
and
only
now
and
then
allow
himself
the
delicious
relaxation
of
go
to
Haytersbank
in
an
evening
,
to
inquire
after
his
aunt
's
health
,
and
to
see
Sylvia
;
for
the
two
foster
be
punctiliously
anxious
to
make
their
shopman
test
all
their
statement
;
insist
on
an
examination
of
the
stock
,
as
if
Hepburn
and
Coulson
be
stranger
to
the
shop
;
have
the
Monkshaven
auctioneer
in
to
appraise
the
fixture
and
necessary
furniture
;
go
over
the
shop
book
for
the
last
twenty
year
with
their
successor
,
an
employment
which
take
up
evening
after
evening
;
and
not
unfrequently
take
one
of
the
young
man
on
the
long
commercial
journey
which
be
tediously
make
in
a
gig
.
<EOS>
by
degree
both
Hepburn
and
Coulson
be
introduce
to
distant
manufacturer
and
wholesale
dealer
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
be
willing
to
take
the
foster
'
word
for
every
statement
the
brother
have
make
on
new
year
's
day
;
but
this
,
it
be
evident
,
would
not
have
satisfy
their
master
,
who
be
scrupulous
in
insist
that
whatever
advantage
there
be
should
always
fall
on
the
side
of
the
young
man

<EOS>
when
Philip
see
Sylvia
she
be
always
quiet
and
gentle
;
perhaps
more
silent
than
she
have
be
a
year
ago
,
and
she
do
not
attend
so
briskly
to
what
be
pass
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
rather
thin
and
paler
;
but
whatever
change
there
be
in
her
be
always
an
improvement
in
Philip
's
eye
,
so
long
as
she
speak
graciously
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
think
she
be
suffer
from
long
-
continue
anxiety
about
her
mother
,
or
that
she
have
too
much
to
do
;
and
either
cause
be
enough
to
make
him
treat
her
with
a
grave
regard
and
deference
which
have
a
repressed
tenderness
in
it
,
of
which
she
,
otherwise
occupy
,
be
quite
unaware

<EOS>
She
like
him
better
,
too
,
than
she
have
do
a
year
or
two
before
,
because
he
do
not

of
the
eager

which
tease
her
then

although
its
meaning

not
fully

<EOS>
thing
be
much
in
this
state
when
the
frost
break
,
and
milder
weather
succeed
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
time
so
long
look
forward
to
by
the
invalid
and
her
friend
,
as
favour
the
doctor
's
recommendation
of
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
to
take
her
to
spend
a
fortnight
with
a
kindly
neighbour
,
who
live
near
the
farm
they
have
occupy
,
forty
mile
or
so
inland
,
before
they
come
to
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
the
widow
-
woman
be
to
come
and
stay
in
the
house
,
to
keep
Sylvia
company
,
during
her
mother
's
absence
.
<EOS>
Daniel
,
indeed
,
be
to
return
home
after
convey
his
wife
to
her
destination
;
but
there
be
so
much
to
be
do
on
the
land
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
that
Sylvia
would
have
be
alone
all
day
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
arrangement
just
mention
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
active
stirring
in
Monkshaven
harbour
as
well
as
on
shore
.
<EOS>
the
whaler
be
finish
their
fitting
-
out
for
the
Greenland
sea
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
"
close
"
season
,
that
be
to
say
,
there
would
be
difficulty
in
pass
the
barrier
of
ice
which
lie
between
the
ship
and
the
whaling
-
ground
;
and
yet
these
must
be
reach
before
June
,
or
the
year
's
expedition
would
be
of
little
avail
.
<EOS>
every
blacksmith
's
shop
rung
with
the
rhythmical
clang
of
busy
hammer
,
beat
out
old
iron
,
such
as
horseshoe
,
nail
or
stub
,
into
the
great
harpoon
;
the
quay
be
throng
with
busy
and
important
sailor
,
rush
hither
and
thither
,
conscious
of
the
demand
in
which
they
be
hold
at
this
season
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
It
be
war
time
,
too
.
<EOS>
many
captain
unable
to
procure
man
in
Monkshaven
would
have
to
complete
their
crew
in
the
Shetlands
.
<EOS>
the
shop
in
the
town
be
equally
busy
;
store
have
to
be
purchase
by
the
whaling
-
master
,
warm
clothing
of
all
sort
to
be
provide
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
large
wholesale
order
;
but
many
a
man
,
and
woman
,
too
,
bring
out
their
small
hoard
to
purchase
extra
comfort
,
or
precious
keepsake
for
some
beloved
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
time
of
the
great
half
-
yearly
traffic
of
the
place
;
another
impetus
be
give
to
business
when
the
whaler
return
in
the
autumn
,
and
the
man
be
flush
of
money
,
and
full
of
delight
at
once
more
see
their
home
and
their
friend
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
to
be
do
in
foster
'
shop
,
and
later
hour
be
keep
than
usual
.
<EOS>
some
perplexity
or
other
be
occupy
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
;
their
mind
be
not
so
much
on
the
alert
as
usual
,
be
engage
on
some
weighty
matter
of
which
they
have
as
yet
speak
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
but
it
thus
happen
that
they
do
not
give
the
prompt
assistance
they
be
accustomed
to
render
at
such
time
;
and
Coulson
have
be
away
on
some
of
the
new
expedition
devolve
on
him
and
Philip
as
future
partner
.
<EOS>
one
evening
after
the
shop
be
close
,
while
they
be
examine
the
good
,
and
compare
the
sale
with
the
entry
in
the
day

book
,
Coulson
suddenly
inquire
    
"
<EOS>
by
the
way
,
Hester
,
do
thee
know
where
the
parcel
of
good

<EOS>
there
be
four
leave
,
as
I
be
pretty
sure
,
when
I
set
off
to
sandsend
;
and
to

day
Mark
Alderson
come
in
,
and
would
fain
have
have
one
,
and
I
could
find
none
nowhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sell

,
to
yon
sailor
,
the
specksioneer

who

He

<EOS>
Philip
have

if
he
will
only

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

be

Philip
;
"
I

<EOS>
"
  
"
t

shop
be
throng
wi

"
say
Hester
,
"
and
he
know
his
own
mind
about
the
handkercher
,
and
do
not
tarry
long
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
be
leave
,
his
eye
catch
on
t

ribbon
,
and
he
come
back
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
when
yo

there
be
a
vast
o

about

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
would
see
him
,
"
say
Coulson
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
ha
'
gi'en
him
a
word
and
a
look
he
would
not

in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
up
?
"
say
Philip
,
surprise
at
William
's
unusual
manner
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
rather
gratified
to
find
a
reflection
of
his
own
feeling
about
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Coulson
's
face
be
pale
with
anger
,
but
for
a
moment
or
two
he
seem
uncertain
whether
he
would
reply
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
up
!
"
say
he
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
this
:
he
come
after
my
sister
for
well
nor
two
year
;
and
a
well
lass
 
no
,
nor
a
prettier
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
eye
 
niver
break
bread
.
<EOS>
and
then
my
master
see
another
girl
,
that
he
like
better
"
 
William
almost
choke
in
his
endeavour
to
keep
down
all
appearance
of
violent
anger
,
and
then
go
on
,
"
and
that
he
play
t
'
same
game
wi
'
,
as
I
have
heerd
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
thy
sister
take
it
?
"
ask
Philip
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
die
in
a
six
-
month
,
"
say
William
;
<EOS>
"
_
she
_
forgive
him
,
but
it
be
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
him
when
I
heerd
of
t
'
work
about
Darley
;
Kinraid
 
and
come
fra
'
Newcassel
,
where
Annie
live
'
prentice
 
<EOS>
and
I
make
inquiry
,
and
it
be
t
'
same
man
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
say
no
more
about
him
,
for
it
stir
t
'
old
Adam
more
nor
I
like
,
or
be
fitting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
out
of
respect
to
him
,
Philip
ask
no
more
question
although
there
be
many
thing
that
he
fain
would
have
know
.
<EOS>
both
Coulson
and
he
go
silently
and
grimly
through
the
remainder
of
their
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
independent
of
any
personal
interest
which
either
or
both
of
them
have
or
may
have
in
Kinraid
's
be
a
light
o
'
love
,
this
fault
of
his
be
one
with
which
the
two
grave
,
sedate
young
man
have
no
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Their
heart
be
true
and
constant
,
whatever
else
may
be
their
failing
;
and
it
be
no
new
thing
to
"
damn
the
fault
we
have
no
mind
to
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
wish
that
it
be
not
so
late
,
or
that
very
evening
he
would
have
go
to
keep
guard
over
Sylvia
in
her
mother
's
absence
 
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
he
may
have
see
reason
to
give
her
a
warning
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
have
do
so
,
it
would
have
be
lock
the
stable
-
door
after
the
steed
be
steal
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
have
turn
his
step
towards
Haytersbank
Farm
as
soon
as
ever
he
have
complete
his
purchase
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
come
that
afternoon
to
Monkshaven
,
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
see
Sylvia
once
more
before
he
go
to
fulfil
his
engagement
as
specksioneer
in
the
_
Urania
_
,
a
whaling
-
vessel
that
be
to
sail
from
North
Shields
on
Thursday
morning
,
and
this
be
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
sit
in
the
house
-
place
,
her
back
to
the
long
low
window
,
in
order
to
have
all
the
light
the
afternoon
hour
afford
for
her
work
.
<EOS>
a
basket
of
her
father
's
unmended
stocking
be
on
the
little
round
table
beside
her
,
and
one
be
on
her
left
hand
,
which
she
suppose
herself
to
be
mend
;
but
from
time
to
time
she
make
long
pause
,
and
look
in
the
fire
;
and
yet
there
be
but
<EOS>
little
motion
of
flame
or
light
in
it
out
of
which
to
conjure
vision
.
<EOS>
It
be
"
redd
up
"
for
the
afternoon
;
cover
with
a
black
mass
of
coal
,
over
which
the
equally
black
kettle
hang
on
the
crook
.
<EOS>
in
the
back
-
kitchen
Dolly
Reid
,
Sylvia
's
assistant
during
her
mother
's
absence
,
chant
a
lugubrious
ditty
,
befit
her
condition
as
a
widow
,
while
she
clean
tin
,
and
can
,
and
milking
-
pail
.
<EOS>
perhaps
these
bustling
sound
prevent
Sylvia
from
hear
approach
footstep
come
down
the
brow
with
swift
advance
;
at
any
rate
,
she
start
and
suddenly
stand
up
as
some
one
enter
the
open
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
<EOS>
she
should
be
so
much
startled
,
for
the
person
who
enter
have
be
in
her
thought
all
during
those
long
pause
.
<EOS>
Charley
Kinraid
and
the
story
of
crazy
Nancy
have
be
the
subject
for
her
dream
for
many
a
day
,
and
many
a
night
.
<EOS>
now
he
stand
there
,
bright
and
handsome
as
ever
,
with
just
that
much
timidity
in
his
face
,
that
anxiety
as
to
his
welcome
,
which
give
his
accost
an
add
charm
,
<EOS>
could
she
but
have
perceive
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
afraid
of
herself
,
so
unwilling
to
show
what
she
feel
,
and
how
much
she
have
be
think
of
him
in
his
absence
,
that
her
reception
seem
cold
and
still
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
come
forward
to
meet
him
;
she
go
crimson
to
the
very
root
of
her
hair
;
but
that
,
in
the
waning
light
,
he
could
not
see
;
and
she
shake
so
that
she
feel
as
if
she
could
hardly
stand
;
but
the
tremor
be
not
visible
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
if
he
remember
the
kiss
that
have
pass
between
them
on
new
year
's
eve
 
the
word
that
have
be
speak
in
the
dairy
on
new
year
's
day
;
the
tone
,
the
look
,
that
have
accompany
those
word
.
<EOS>
but
all
she
say
be
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
to
see
yo
'
.
<EOS>
I
think
yo'd
ha
'
sail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
yo
'
I
should
come
back
,
do
not
I
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
still
stand
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
wait
to
be
ask
to
sit
down
;
and
she
,
in
her
bashfulness
,
forget
to
give
the
invitation
,
but
,
instead
,
pretend
to
be
attentively
mend
the
stocking
she
hold
.
<EOS>
neither
could
keep
quiet
and
silent
long
.
<EOS>
She
feel
his
eye
be
upon
her
,
watch
every
motion
,
and
grow
more
and
more
confused
in
her
expression
and
behaviour
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
take
aback
by
the
nature
of
his
reception
,
and
be
not
sure
at
first
whether
to
take
the
great
change
in
her
manner
,
from
what
it
have
be
when
last
he
see
her
,
as
a
favourable
symptom
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
luckily
for
him
,
in
some
turn
of
her
arm
to
reach
the
scissor
on
the
table
,
she
catch
the
edge
of
her
work
-
basket
,
and
down
it
fall
.
<EOS>
She
stoop
to
pick
up
the
scatter
stocking
and
ball
of
worst
,
and
so
do
he
;
and
when
they
rise
up
,
he
have
fast
hold
of
her
hand
,
and
her
face
be
turn
away
,
half
ready
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
ail
yo
'
at
me
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
beseechingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
'
may
ha

forgotten
me
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
think
we
make
a
bargain
against

each
other

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
:
"
Yo've
never

my
thought
,
Sylvia
Robson
;
<EOS>
and
I

to
Monkshaven
for
nought
but
<EOS>
to
see

once

away
to

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

what
to

"
say
she
,
in
a
low
,
almost
inaudible
tone
.
<EOS>
then
harden
herself
,
and
resolve
to
speak
as
if
she
do
not
understand
his
only
half
-
express
meaning
,
she
lift
up
her
head
,
and
all
but
look
at
him
 
while
she
wrench
her
hand
out
of
his

Charley
do
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
so

<EOS>
then
he
say
    
"

himself
of

silent

wet
blushing

hide
it
in

He
lull

soothe
her
in

as

they

down

He
ask
her
about

not

He
have
intend

acknowledge
his

for
various

he

the

be

dizzy
with

at
the
sound
of
his
tender

her
eager

be
ready

<EOS>
"
I

he

out

perhaps
when

get
a
rich

he
will
come

ask
my

his

what

<EOS>

He

niver

impatiently

almost
as

she
,
weary
of
a
subject
she
care
nothing

eager
to
identify
herself
with

ask
him
about
his
plan
almost
at
the

time
that
he
say
these
last

they
go
on
as

intermix
a
great

tender

Dolly

come
in

Sylvia

as
he

Kester
return
homeward

she
start

upstairs
in

affright

leave
Charley
to
explain
his

solitary

He

forward

Jeremiah
come
out
of

parlour
in
which
his

sit

silence

through

look
up

search
of
the
old
lame
woman

all
much
relieved

the
old
woman
at
length
appear
with
her
basket
of
letter

<EOS>
one
of
these
seem
of
especial
consequence
to
the
good
brother

<EOS>
They
each
separately
look
at
the
direction
,
and
then
at
one
another
;
and
without
a
word
they
return
with
it
unread
into
the
parlour
,
shut
the
door
,
and
draw
the
green
silk
curtain
close
,
the

read
it
in
privacy

<EOS>
both
Coulson
and
Philip
feel
that
something
unusual
be
go
on
,
and
be
,
perhaps
,
as
full
of
consideration
as
to
the
possible
content
of
this
London
letter
,
as
of
attention
to
their
more
immediate
business
.
<EOS>
but
fortunately
there
be
little
do
in

Philip
,
indeed
,
be
quite
idle
when
John
Foster
open
the
parlour

door

and
,
half
doubtfully
,
call
him
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
as
the
door
of
communication
shut
the
three
in

Coulson
feel
himself
a
little
aggrieved

<EOS>
a
minute
ago
Philip
<EOS>
and
he
be
on
a
level
of
ignorance
,
from
which
the
former
be
evidently
go
to
be
raise
.
<EOS>
but
he
soon
return
to
his
usual
state
of
acquiescence
in
thing
as
they
be
,
which
be
partly
constitutional
,
and
partly
the
result
of
his
Quaker
training
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
apparently
by
John
Foster
's
wish
that
Philip
have
be
summon

<EOS>
Jeremiah

the
less
energetic
and
decide
brother

be
still
discuss
the

the
step
when

no

will

from
his
account
to
Philip
(
explanatory
of
what
he
,
in

of
his

slow
judgment

think
to
be
a

,
that

for

anonymous

business
dealing
for
many
year
;
but
to
whom
they
have
latterly
advanced
money
.
<EOS>
the
letter
hint
at
the
utter
insolvency
of
this
manufacturer
.
<EOS>
They
have
urge
their
correspondent
to
give
them
his
name
in
confidence
,
and
this
morning
's
letter
have
bring
it
;
but
the
name
be
totally
unknown
to
them
,
though
there
seem
no
reason
to
doubt
the
reality
of
either
it
or
the
address
,
the
latter
of
which
be
give
in
full
.
<EOS>
certain
circumstance
be
mention
regard
the
transaction
between
the
Fosters
and
this
manufacturer
,
which
could
be
know
only
to
those
who
be
in
the
confidence
of
one
or
the
other
;
and
to
the
foster
the
man
be
,
as
have
be
say
,
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
probably
,
they
would
have
be
unwilling
to
incur
the
risk
they
have
do
on
this
manufacturer
Dickinson
's
account
,
if
it
have
not
be
that
he
belong
to
the
same
denomination
as
themselves
,
and
be
publicly
distinguish
for
his
excellent
and
philanthropic
character
;
but
these
letter
be
provocative
of
anxiety
,
especially
since
this
morning
's
post
have
bring
out
the
writer
's
full
name
,
and
various
particular
show
his
intimate
knowledge
of
Dickinson
's
affair
.
  
<EOS>
after
much
perplex
consultation
,
John
have
hit
upon
the
plan
of
send
Hepburn
to
London
to
make
secret
inquiry
respect
the
true
character
and
commercial
position
of
the
man
whose
creditor
,
not
a
month
ago
,
they
have
esteem
it
an
honour
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
even
now
Jeremiah
be
ashamed
of
their
want
of
confidence
in
one
so
good
;
he
believe
that
the
information
they
have
receive
would
all
prove
a
mistake
,
found
on
erroneous
ground
,
if
not
a
pure
invention
of
an
enemy
;
and
he
have
only
be
bring
partially
to
consent
to
the
sending
of
Hepburn
,
by
his
brother
's
pledge
himself
that
the
real
nature
of
Philip
's
errand
should
be
unknown
to
any
human
creature
,
save
them
three
.
  
<EOS>
as
all
this
be
be
reveal
to
Philip
,
he
sit
apparently
unmoved
and
simply
attentive
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
be
give
all
his
mind
to
understand
the
probability
of
the
case
,
leave
his
own
feeling
in
the
background
till
his
intellect
should
have
do
its
work
.
<EOS>
He
say
little
;
but
what
he
do
say
be
to
the
point
,
and
satisfy
both
brother
.
<EOS>
John
perceive
that
his
messenger
would
exercise
penetration
and
act
with
energy
;
while
Jeremiah
be
soothe
by
Philip
's
caution
in
not
hastily
admit
the
probability
of
any
charge
against
Dickinson
,
and
in
give
full
weight
to
his
previous
good
conduct
and
good
character
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
the
satisfaction
of
feel
himself
employ
on
a
mission
which
would
call
out
his
power
,
and
yet
not
exceed
them
.
<EOS>
in
his
own
mind
he
forestall
the
instruction
of
his
master
,
and
be
silently
in
advance
of
John
Foster
's
plan
and
arrangement
,
while
he
appear
to
listen
to
all
that
be
say
with
quiet
business
-
like
attention
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
the
next
morning
he
be
to
make
his
way
northward
to
Hartlepool
<EOS>
,
whence
he
could
easily
proceed
either
by
land
or
sea
to
Newcastle
,
from
which
place
smack
be
constantly
sail
to
London
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
personal
conduct
and
behaviour
there
,
the
brother
overwhelm
him
with
direction
and
advice
;
nor
do
they
fail
to
draw
out
of
the
strong
box
in
the
thick
wall
of
their
counting
-
house
a
more
than
sufficient
sum
of
money
for
all
possible
expense
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
never
have
so
much
in
his
hand
before
,
and
hesitate
to
take
it
,
say
it
be
more
than
he
should
require
;
but
they
repeat
,
with
fresh
urgency
,
their
warning
about
the
terrible
high
price
of
London
,
till
he
could
only
resolve
to
keep
a
strict
account
,
and
bring
back
all
that
he
do
not
expend
,
since
nothing
but
his
take
the
whole
sum
would
satisfy
his
employer
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
once
more
behind
the
counter
,
he
have
leisure
enough
for
consideration
as
far
as
Coulson
could
give
it
him
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
silent
,
brood
over
the
confidence
which
Philip
have
apparently
receive
,
but
which
be
withhold
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
yet
know
of
the
culminating
point
 
of
Philip
's
propose
journey
to
London
;
that
great
city
of
London
,
which
,
from
its
very
inaccessibility
fifty
year
ago
,
loom
so
magnificent
through
the
mist
of
man
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
deny
that
Philip
feel
exultant
at
the
mere
fact
of
"
go
to
London
.
"
<EOS>
but
then
again
,
the
thought
of
leave
Sylvia
;
of
go
out
of
possible
daily
reach
of
her
;
of
not
see
her
for
a
week
 
a
fortnight
;
nay
,
he
may
be
away
for
a
month
,
 
for
no
rash
hurry
<EOS>
be
to
mar
his
delicate
negotiation
,
 
<EOS>
gnaw
at
his
heart
,
and
spoilt
any
enjoyment
he
may
have
anticipate
from
gratified
curiosity
,
or
even
from
the
consciousness
of
be
trust
by
those
whose
trust
and
regard
he
value
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
what
he
be
leave
grow
upon
him
the
longer
he
think
on
the
subject
;
he
almost
wish
that
he
have
tell
his
master
earlier
in
the
conversation
of
his
unwillingness
to
leave
Monkshaven
for
so
long
a
time
;
and
then
again
he
feel
that
the
gratitude
he
owe
them
quite
prohibit
his
decline
any
task
they
may
impose
,
especially
as
they
have
more
than
once
say
that
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
appear
in
the
affair
,
and
yet
that
to
no
one
else
could
they
entrust
so
difficult
and
delicate
a
matter
.
<EOS>
several
time
that
day
,
as
he
perceive
Coulson
's
jealous
sullenness
,
he
think
in
his
heart
that
the
consequence
of
the
excessive
confidence
for
which
Coulson
envy
him
be
a
burden
from
which
he
would
be
thankful
to
be
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
all
sit
at
tea
in
Alice
Rose
's
house
-
place
,
Philip
announce
his
intended
journey
;
a
piece
of
intelligence
he
have
not
communicate
earlier
to
Coulson
because
he
have
rather
dread
the
increase
of
dissatisfaction
<EOS>
it
be
sure
to
produce
,
and
of
which
he
know
the
expression
would
be
restrain
by
the
presence
of
Alice
Rose
and
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
Lunnon
!
"
exclaim
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
some
folk
have
the
luck
!
"
say
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Luck
!
<EOS>
"
say
Alice
,
turn
sharp
round
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Niver
let
me
hear
such
a
vain
word
out
o
'
thy
mouth
,
laddie
,
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Lord
's
do
,
and
luck
be
the
devil
's
way
o
'
put
it
.
<EOS>
maybe
it
be
to
try
Philip
he
be
send
there
;
happen
it
may
be
a
fiery
furnace
to
him
;
for
I
have
heerd
tell
it
be
full
o
'
temptation
,
and
he
may
fall
into
sin
 
<EOS>
and
then
where
'd
be
the
"
luck
"
on
it
?
<EOS>
but
why

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
none

"
say
Philip
;
"
there
be
business
to
be
do
,
and
John
Foster
say
I
be
to
do
it
;
and
I
be
to
start
to

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not

resolutely

<EOS>
"
Niver

about

"

Philip

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
Hearken
to

Alice

"
<EOS>
He
speak
as
if

be
nought
to
him
,
and
he
wi
'
a
good
half

dozen
as
I
make

<EOS>
eh
,
lad
?
<EOS>
but
if
that
be
the
frame
o

mind
<EOS>
thou'rt
in
,
Lunnon
be
like
for
to
be
a
sore
place
o

temptation
.
<EOS>
there
be
pitfall
for
man
,
and
trap
for
money
at
ivery
turn
,
as
I
have
heerd
say
.
<EOS>
It
would
ha
'
be
well
if
John
Foster
have
send
an
old
man
on
his
business
,
whativer
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
make
a
deal
o
<EOS>
'
Philip
all
on
a
sudden
,
"
say
Coulson
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
send
for
,
and
talk
to
i

privacy
,
while
Hester

Philip
know

say
Hester
,
and
then
,
somehow
,
her
voice
fail
her
<EOS>
and
she
stop
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
pay
no
attention
to
this
half
-
uttered
sentence
;
he
be
eager
to
tell
Coulson
,
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
without
betray
his
master
's
secret
,
how
many
drawback
there
be
to
his
propose
journey
,
in
the
responsibility
which
it
involve
,
and
his
unwillingness
to
leave
Monkshaven
:
he
say
    
"
Coulson
,
I
would
give
a
deal
it
be
thou
that
be
go
,
and
not
me
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
there
be
many
a
time
I
would
give
a
deal
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
but
at
other
time
I
be
pleased
at
the
thought
<EOS>
on't
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
could
I
would
change
place
wi
'
thee
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
fine
talking
,
"
say
Coulson
,
half
mollified
,
and
yet
not
care
to
show
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
doubt
it
be
an
even
chance
betwixt
us
two
at
first
,
which
on
us
be
to
go
;
but
somehow
thou
get
the
start
and
thou'st
stick
to
it
till
it
be
too
late
for
aught
<EOS>
but
to
say
thou
's
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
William
,
"
say
Philip
,
rise
,
"
it
be
an
ill
look
-
out
for
the
future
,
if
thee
and
me
be
to
quarrel
,
like
two
silly
wench
,
o'er
each
bit
of
pleasure

what
thou
fancy
to

either
on
us

<EOS>
I
have
say
truth
to
thee
,
and
play
thee
fair
,
and
I
have
get
to
go
to
Haytersbank
for
to
wish
'em
good
-
by
,
so
I
will
not
stay
longer
here
to
be
misdoubte
by
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
his
cap
and
be
go
,
not
heed
Alice
's
shrill
inquiry
as
to
his
clothe
and
his
ruffle
shirt
.
<EOS>
Coulson
sit
still
,
penitent
and
ashamed
;
at
length
he
steal
a
look
at
Hester
.
<EOS>
She
be
play
with
her
teaspoon
,
but
he
could
see
that
she
be
choke
down
her
tear
;
he
could
not
choose
but
force
her
to
speak
with
an
ill
-
time
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
to
do
,
Hester
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
She
lift
up
those
eye
,
usually
so
soft
and
serene
;
now
they
be
full
of
the
light
of
indignation
shine
through
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
do
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
;
"
Coulson
,
I
would
think
better
of
thee
,
go
and
doubt
and
envy
Philip

as
niver
do
thee
an
ill
turn
,
or
say
an
ill
word
,
or
think
an
ill
thought
by
thee
;
and
send
him
away
out
o
'
t
'
house
this
last
night
of
all
,
may
-
be
,
wi
'
thy
envying
and
jealousy

"
  
<EOS>
She
hastily
get
up
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
away
,
look
up
Philip
's
thing
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
Coulson
remain
alone
,
feel
like
a
guilty
child
,
but
dismay
by
Hester
's
word
,
even
more
than
by
his
own
regret
at
what
he
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
walk
rapidly
up
the
hill
-
road
towards
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
He
be
chafe
and
excite
by
Coulson
's
word
,
and
the
event
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
mean
to
shape
his
life
,
and
now
it
be
,
as
it
be
,
be
shape
for
him
,
and
yet
he
be
reproach
for
the
course
it
be
take
,
as
much
as
though
he
be
an
active
agent
;
accuse
of
take
advantage
over
Coulson
,
<EOS>
his
intimate
companion
for
year
;
he
who
esteem
himself
above
take
an
unfair
advantage
over
any
man
!
<EOS>
His
feeling
on
the
subject
be
akin
to
that
of
Hazael
,
"
be
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
feeling
,
disturb
on
this
one
point
,
shake
his
judgment
off
its
balance
on
another
.
<EOS>
the
resolution
he
have
deliberately
form
of
not
speak
to
Sylvia
on
the
subject
of
his
love
till
he
could
announce
to
her
parent
the
fact
of
his
succession
to
foster
'
business
,
and
till
he
have
patiently
,
with
long
-
continue
and
deep
affection
,
work
his
way
into
her
regard
,
be
set
aside
during
the
present
walk
.
<EOS>
He
would
speak
to
her
of
his
passionate
attachment
,
before
he
leave
,
for
an
uncertain
length
of
time
,
and
the
certain
distance
of
London
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
modification
on
this
point
which
his
judgment
could
obtain
from
his
impetuous
and
excited
heart
be
,
that
he
would
watch
her
word
and
manner
well
when
he
announce
his
approach
absence
,
and
if
in
them
he
read
the
slight
token
of
tender
regretful
feeling
,
he
would
pour
out
his
love
at
her
foot
,
not
even
urge
the
young
girl
to
make
any
return
,
or
to
express
the
feeling
of
which
he
hope
the
germ
be
already
bud
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
patient
with
her
;
he
could
not
be
patient
himself
.
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
,
<EOS>
his
busy
mind
rehearse
the
probable
coming
scene
<EOS>
,
he
turn
into
the
field
-
path
that
lead
to
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
come
along
it
,
and
so
meet
him
,
advance
Daniel
Robson
,
in
earnest
talk
with
Charley
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
,
then
,
have
be
at
the
farm
:
<EOS>
Kinraid
have
be
see
Sylvia
,
her
mother
away
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
poor
dead
Annie
Coulson
flash
into
Philip
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
play
the
same
game
with
Sylvia
?
<EOS>
Philip
set
his
tooth
and
tighten
his
lip
at
the
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
stop
talk
;
they
have
see
him
already
,
or
his
impulse
would
have
be
to
dodge
behind
the
wall
and
avoid
them
;
even
though
one
of
his
purpose
in
go
to
Haytersbank
have
be
to
bid
his
uncle
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
take
him
by
surprise
from
the
hearty
greeting
he
give
him
,
and
which
Philip
would
fain
have
avoid
.
<EOS>
but
the
specksioneer
be
full
of
kindliness
towards
all
the
world
,
especially
towards
all
Sylvia
's
friend
,
and
,
convinced
of
her
great
love
towards
himself
,
have
forget
any
previous
jealousy
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
secure
and
exultant
,
his
broad
,
handsome
,
weather
-
bronze
face
be
as
great
a
contrast
to
Philip
's
long
,
thoughtful
,
sallow
countenance
,
as
his
frank
manner
be
to
the
other
's
cold
reserve
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
minute
before
Hepburn
could
bring
himself
to
tell
the
great
event
that
be
about
to
befall
him
before
this
third
person
whom
he
consider
as
an
intrusive
stranger
.
<EOS>
but
as
Kinraid
seem
to
have
no
idea
of
go
on
,
and
as
there
really
be
no
reason
why
he
and
all
the
world
should
not
know
of
Philip
's
intention
,
he
tell
his
uncle
that
he
be
bind
for
London
the
next
day
on
business
connect
with
the
foster
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
be
deeply
strike
with
the
fact
that
he
be
talk
to
a
man
set
off
for
London
at
a

notice
.
  
<EOS>
"

Kinraid
now
seem
in

Philip
be
sting
with
curiosity
to
ascertain
his
movement
,

suddenly
address

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
abruptness
in
Philip
's
tone
,
if
not
in
his
word
,
which
make
Kinraid
look
in
his
face
with
surprise

and
answer
with
equal
curtness

<EOS>
"
I

He

away

and
begin
to
whistle

as
if
he
do

Philip

Philip

to

word
to

who
,
satisfied
with
his

Her

be
right

<EOS>
She
have
talk
about

regret
at

accompany
her
father
to

some
new
kind
of
harpoon
about
which
the

have
speak

<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
they
have
leave
the
house
,
and
she
have
covertly
watch
them
up
the
brow
in

field
,
she
sate
down

meditate
and
dream
about
her
great
happiness

Charley

by

a
footstep
quite
familiar
enough
for

which

neglect

he
go
on
with
the
apology
she
care
not

<EOS>
if
she
have
be
less
occupied
with
her

affair
,
less
engrossed
with
deep

she
would
have
reproach
him

if

in

for

EDDY
in
LOVE
's
CURRENT
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
shone
bright
and
clear
,
if
ever
a
March
morning
do
.
<EOS>
the
beguile
month
be
come
in
like
a
lamb
,
with
whatever
storm
it
may
go
rage
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
long
since
Philip
have
taste
the
freshness
of
the
early
air
on
the
shore
,
or
in
the
country
,
as
his
employment
at
the
shop
detain
him
in
Monkshaven
till
the
evening
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
turn
down
the
quay
(
or
staithe
)
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
,
towards
the
shore
,
and
meet
the
fresh
sea
-
breeze
blow
right
in
his
face
,
it
be
impossible
not
to
feel
bright
and
elastic
.
<EOS>
with
his
knapsack
sling
over
his
shoulder
,
he
be
prepare
for
a
good
stretch
towards
Hartlepool
,
whence
a
coach
would
take
him
to
Newcastle
before
night
.
<EOS>
for
seven
or
eight
mile
the
level
sand
be
as
short
and
far
more
agreeable
a
road
than
the
up
and
down
land
-
way
.
<EOS>
Philip
walk
on
pretty
briskly
,
unconsciously
enjoy
the
sunny
landscape
before
him
;
the
crisp
curl
wave
rush
almost
up
to
his
foot
,
on
his
right
hand
,
and
then
swish
back
over
the
fine
small
pebble
into
the
great
swelling
sea
.
<EOS>
to
his
left
be
the
cliff
rise
one
behind
another
,
have
deep
gully
here
and
there
between
,
with
long
green
slope
upward
from
the
land
,
and
then
sudden
fall
of
brown
and
red
soil
or
rock
deepen
to
a
yet
great
richness
of
colour
at
their
base
towards
the
blue
ocean
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
loud
,
monotonous
murmur
of
the
advance
and
recede
water
lull
him
into
dreaminess
;
the
sunny
look
of
everything
tinge
his
day
-
dream
with
hope
.
<EOS>
so
he
trudge
merrily
over
the
first
mile
or
so
;
not
an
obstacle
to
his
measured
pace
on
the
hard
,
level
pavement
;
not
a
creature
to
be
see
since
he
have
leave
the
little
gathering
of
bare
-
legged
urchin
dabble
in
the
sea
-
pool
near
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
the
care
of
land
be
shut
out
by
the
glorious
barrier
of
rock
before
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
great
masse
that
have
be
detach
by
the
action
of
the
weather
,
and
lie
half
embed
in
the
sand
,
draperie
over
by
the
heavy
pendent
olive
-
green
seaweed
.
<EOS>
the
wave
be
near
at
this
point
;
the
advance
sea
come
up
with
a
mighty
distant
length
of
roar
;
here
and
there
the
smooth
swell
be
lash
by
the
fret
against
unseen
rock
into
white
breaker
;
but
otherwise
the
wave
come
up
from
the
German
Ocean
upon
that
English
shore
with
a
long
steady
roll
that
may
have
take
its
first
impetus
far
away
,
in
the
haunt
of
the
sea
-
serpent
on
the
coast
of
"
Norroway
over
the
foam
.
<EOS>
"
the
air
be
soft
as
May
;
right
overhead
the
sky
be
blue
,
but
it
deaden
into
gray
near
the
sea
line
.
<EOS>
flock
of
seagull
hover
about
the
edge
of
the
wave
,
slowly
rise
and
turn
their
white
under
-
plumage
to
glimmer
in
the
sunlight
as
Philip
approach
.
<EOS>
the
whole
scene
be
so
peaceful
,
so
soothing
,
that
it
dispel
the
care
and
fear
(
too
well
found
in
fact
)
which
have
weigh
down
on
his
heart
during
the
dark
hour
of
the
past
night
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
Haytersbank
gully
open
down
its
green
entrance
among
the
warm
brown
basis
of
the
cliff
.
<EOS>
below
,
in
the
sheltered
brushwood
,
among
the
last
year
's
wither
leave
,
some
primrose
may
be
find
.
<EOS>
He
half
think
of
gather
Sylvia
a
posy
of
them
,
and
rush
up
to
the
farm
to
make
a
little
farewell
peace
-
offering
.
<EOS>
but
on
look
at
his
watch
,
he
put
all
thought
of
such
an
action
out
of
his
head
;
it
be
above
an
hour
later
than
he
have
suppose
,
and
he
must
make
all
haste
on
to
Hartlepool
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
be
approach
this
gully
,
a
man
come
dash
down
,
and
run
out
some
way
upon
the
sand
with
the
very
force
of
his
descent
;
then
he
turn
to
the
left
and
take
the
direction
of
Hartlepool
a
hundred
yard
or
so
in
advance
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
never
stay
to
look
round
him
,
but
go
swiftly
and
steadily
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
by
the
peculiar
lurch
in
his
walk
 
by
everything
 
Philip
know
it
be
the
specksioneer
,
Kinraid
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
road
up
Haytersbank
gully
lead
to
the
farm
,
and
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
still
any
one
wish
to
descend
to
the
shore
may
do
so
by
first
go
up
to
the
Robsons
'
house
,
and
skirt
the
wall
till
they
come
to
the
little
slend
path
down
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
but
by
the
farm
,
by
the
very
house
-
door
they
must
of
necessity
pass
.
<EOS>
Philip
slacken
his
pace
,
keep
under
the
shadow
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
Kinraid
,
walk
on
the
sunlight
open
sand
,
turn
round
and
look
long
and
earnestly
towards
Haytersbank
gully
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
pause
when
he
pause
,
but
as
intently
as
he
look
at
some
object
above
,
so
intently
do
Hepburn
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
no
need
to
ascertain
by
sight
towards
whom
his
look
,
his
thought
be
direct
.
<EOS>
He
take
off
his
hat
and
wave
it
,
touch
one
part
of
it
as
if
with
particular
meaning
.
<EOS>
when
he
turn
away
at
last
,
Hepburn
heave
a
heavy
sigh
,
and
creep
yet
more
into
the
cold
dank
shadow
of
the
cliff
.
<EOS>
each
step
be
now
a
heavy
task
,
his
sad
heart
tired
and
weary
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
he
climb
up
a
few
foot
,
so
as
to
mingle
his
form
yet
more
completely
with
the
stone
and
rock
around
.
<EOS>
stumble
over
the
uneven
and
often
jag
point
,
slip
on
the
sea
-
weed
,
plunge
into
little
pool
of
water
leave
by
the
ebb
tide
in
some
natural
basin
,
he
yet
keep
his
eye
fix
as
if
in
fascination
on
Kinraid
,
and
make
his
way
almost
alongside
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
last
hour
have
pinch
Hepburn
's
feature
into
something
of
the
wan
haggardness
they
would
wear
when
he
should
first
be
lie
still
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
two
man
be
draw
near
a
creek
,
about
eight
mile
from
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
the
creek
be
form
by
a
beck
(
or
small
stream
)
that
come
flow
down
from
the
moor
,
and
take
its
way
to
the
sea
between
the
widen
rock
.
<EOS>
the
melting
of
the
snow
and
running
of
the
flood
water
-
spring
above
make
this
beck
in
the
early
spring
-
time
both
deep
and
wide
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
know
that
here
they
both
must
take
a
path
lead
inland
to
a
narrow
foot
-
bridge
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
stream
;
indeed
from
this
point
,
owe
to
the
jut
out
of
the
rock
,
the
land
path
be
the
short
;
and
this
way
lie
by
the
water
-
side
at
an
angle
right
below
the
cliff
to
which
Hepburn
's
step
be
lead
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
on
this
long
level
field
path
he
may
easily
be
see
by
any
one
follow
;
nay
,
if
he
follow
any
one
at
a
short
distance
,
for
it
be
full
of
turning
;
and
he
resolve
,
late
as
he
be
,
to
sit
down
for
a
while
till
Kinraid
be
far
enough
in
advance
for
him
to
escape
be
see
.
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
the
last
rock
behind
which
he
could
be
conceal
;
seven
or
eight
foot
above
the
stream
he
stand
,
and
look
cautiously
for
the
specksioneer
.
<EOS>
up
by
the
rush
stream
he
look
,
then
right
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
God
's
providence
,
"
he
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
God
's
providence
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
crouch
down
where
he
have
be
stand
and
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
deafen
as
well
as
to
blind
himself
,
that
he
may
neither
hear
nor
see
anything
of
the
come
event
of
which
he
,
an
inhabitant
of
Monkshaven
at
that
day
,
well
understand
the
betokening
sign
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
have
take
the
large
angle
of
the
sand
before
turn
up
towards
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
come
along
now
near
the
rock
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
he
be
sufficiently
buoyant
to
whistle
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
steel
Philip
's
heart
to
what
be
come
to
hear
his
rival
whistling
,
"
Weel
may
the
keel
row
,
"
so
soon
after
part
with
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
the
instant
Kinraid
turn
the
corner
of
the
cliff
,
the
ambush
be
upon
him
.
<EOS>
four
man
-
of
-
war
's
man
spring
on
him
and
strove
to
pinion
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
King
's
name
!
"
cry
they
,
with
rough
,
triumphant
jeer
.
  
<EOS>
Their
boat
be
moor
not
a
dozen
yard
above
;
they
be

They

in
the

of

by

such
a
prize
as
this
active
,
strong
,
and
evidently
superior
sailor
,
be
what
they
have
not
hope
for

and
their
endeavour

secure
him
be
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
the

<EOS>
although
take
by
surprise

by
so
many

Kinraid
do
not

his

He
wrench
himself
free

cry
out
loud
:

but
of
what

out

of
what

be

powerful
enough
to

time

popular
panic
against

<EOS>
"
D

cry
the
leader
of

;

come
and

well
than

say
the
specksioneer
,
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
,
which
the
swift
-
eyed
sailor
oppose
to
him
see
and
interpret
rightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt

wilt
thou

"
  
<EOS>
in
a
minute
his
cutlass
be
force
from
him
,
and
it
become
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
struggle
,
of
which
,
from
the
difference
in
number
,
it
be
not
difficult
to
foretell
the
result
.
<EOS>
yet
Kinraid
make
desperate
effort
to
free
himself
;
he
waste
no
breath
in
word
,
but
fight
,
as
the
man
say
,
"
like
a
very
devil
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
hear
loud
pant
of
breath
,
great
thud
,
the
dull
struggle
of
limb
on
the
sand
,
the
growl
curse
of
those
who
think
to
have
manage
their
affair
more
easily
;
the
sudden
cry
of
some
one
wound
,
not
Kinraid
<EOS>
he
know
,
Kinraid
would
have
bear
any
pain
in
silence
at
such
a
moment
;
another
wrestling
,
swearing
,
infuriate
strife
,
and
then
a
strange
silence
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
sicken
at
the
heart
;
be
then
his
rival
dead
?
<EOS>
have
he
leave
this
bright
world
?
<EOS>
lose
his
life
 
his
love
?
<EOS>
for
an
instant
Hepburn
feel
guilty
of
his
death
;
he
say
to
himself
he
have
never
wish
him
dead
,
and
yet
in
the
struggle
he
have
keep
aloof
,
and
now
it
may
be
too
late
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Philip
could
not
bear
the
suspense
;
he
look
stealthily
round
the
corner
of
the
rock
behind
which
he
have
be
hide
,
and
see
that
they
have
overpower
Kinraid
,
and
,
too
exhausted
to
speak
,
be
bind
him
hand
and
foot
to
carry
him
to
their
boat
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
lie
as
still
as
any
hedgehog
:
he
roll
when
they
push
him
;
he
suffer
himself
to
be
drag
without
any
resistance
,
any
motion
;
the
strong
colour
bring
into
his
face
while
fighting
be
go
now
,
his
countenance
be
livid
pale
;
his
lip
be
tightly
hold
together
,
as
if
it
cost
him
more
effort
to
be
passive
,
wooden
,
and
stiff
in
their
hand
than
it
have
do
to
fight
and
struggle
with
all
his
might
.
<EOS>
His
eye
seem
the
only
part
about
him
that
show
cognizance
of
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
They
be
watchful
,
vivid
,
fierce
as
those
of
a
wild
cat
bring
to
bay
,
seek
in
its
desperate
quicken
brain
for
some
mode
of
escape
not
yet
visible
,
and
in
all
probability
never
to
become
visible
to
the
hopeless
creature
in
its
supreme
agony
.
  
<EOS>
without
a
motion
of
his
head
,
he
be
perceive
and
take
in
everything
while
he
lie
bind
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
a
sailor
sit
by
his
side
,
who
have
be
hurt
by
a
blow
from
him
.
<EOS>
the
man
hold
his
head
in
his
hand
,
moan
;
but
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
revenge
himself
by
a
kick
at
the
prostrate
specksioneer
,
till
even
his
comrade
stop
their
cursing
and
swear
at
their
prisoner
for
the
trouble
he
have
give
them
,
to
cry
shame
on
their
comrade
.
<EOS>
but
Kinraid
never
speak
,
nor
shrink
from
the
outstretched
foot
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
his
captor
,
with
the
successful
insolence
of
victory
,
venture
to
jeer
him
on
the
suppose
reason
for
his
vehement
and
hopeless
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
He
may
have
say
yet
more
insolent
thing
;
the
kick
may
have
hit
harder
;
Kinraid
do
not
hear
or
heed
.
<EOS>
His
soul
be
beat
itself
against
the
bar
of
inflexible
circumstance
;
review
in
one
terrible
instant
of
time
what
have
be
,
what
may
have
be
,
what
be
.
<EOS>
yet
while
these
thought
thus
stab
him
,
he
be
still
mechanically
look
out
for
chance
.
<EOS>
He
move
his
head
a
little
,
so
as
to
turn
towards
Haytersbank
,
where
Sylvia
must
be
quickly
,
if
sadly
,
go
about
her
simple
daily
work
;
and
then
his
quick
eye
catch
Hepburn
's
face
,
blanch
with
excitement
rather
than
fear
,
watch
eagerly
from
behind
the
rock
,
where
he
have
sit
breathless
during
the
affray
and
the
impressment
of
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
shout
the
specksioneer
as
soon
as
he
see
Philip
,
heave
and
writhe
his
body
the
while
with
so
much
vigour
that
the
sailor
start
away
from
the
work
they
be
engage
in
about
the
boat
,
and
hold
him
down
once
more
,
as
if
afraid
he
should
break
the
strong
rope
that
hold
him
like
withe
of
green
flax
.
<EOS>
but
the
bind
man
have
no
such
notion
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
mighty
wish
be
to
call
Hepburn
near
that
he
may
send
some
message
by
him
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
Hepburn
,
"
he
cry
again
,
fall
back
this
time
so
weak
and
exhausted
that
the
man
-
of
-
war
's
man
become
sympathetic
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
down
,
peep
Tom
,
and
do
not

afeare
,
"
they
call
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afeare

"
say
Philip
;
"
I
be
no
sailor
for
yo
'
t

me
:
nor
have
yo

any
right
to
take
that
fellow
;
he

specksioneer

I
know
and
can
testify

<EOS>
"
  
"
Yo

what

dirty
blubbery
whale

ship
,
and
be
now
in
his
Majesty

service

have
get
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
Jack
,
"
go
on
the
speaker
,
"
it
be
some
message
to
his
sweetheart
,
ask
her
to
come
for
to
serve
on
board
ship
along
with
he
,
like
Billy
Taylor
's
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
come
towards
them
slowly
,
not
from
want
of
activity
,
but
because
he
be
undecided
what
he
should
be
call
upon
to
do
or
to
say
by
the
man
whom
he
hate
and
dread
,
yet
whom
just
now
he
could
not
help
admire
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
groan
with
impatience
at
see
one
,
free
to
move
with
quick
decision
,
so
slow
and
dilatory
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
on
then
,
"
cry
the
sailor
,
"
or
we
will
take
you
too
on
board
,
and
run
you
up
and
down
the
main
-
mast
a
few
time
.
<EOS>
nothing
like
life
aboard
ship
for
quicken
a
land
-
lubber

<EOS>
"
  
"
yo'd
better
take
him
and
leave
me

"

Kinraid
,
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
teach
my
lesson
;
and
seemingly
he
have
his
yet
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
Majesty
be
not
a
schoolmaster
to

scholar
;
but
a
jolly
good
captain
to
need
man

"
reply
the
leader
of
the
gang
,
eye
Philip
nevertheless
,
and
question
within
himself
how
far
,
with
only
two
other
available
man
,
they
durst
venture
on
his
capture
as
well
as
the
specksioneer
's
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
do
,
he
think
,
even
though
there
be
this
powerful
captive
aboard
,
and
the
boat
to
manage
too
;
but
,
run
his
eye
over
Philip
's
figure
<EOS>
,
he
decide
that
the
tall
stooping
fellow
be
never
cut
out
for
a
sailor
,
and
that
he
should
get
small
thank
if
he
capture
him
,
to
pay
him
for
the
possible
risk
of
lose
the
other
.
<EOS>
or
else
the
mere
fact
of
be
a
landsman
be
of
as
little
consequence
to
the
press
-
gang
,
as
the
protect
paper
which
Kinraid
have
vainly
show
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
fellow
would
not
have
be
worth
his
grog
this
many
a
day
,
and
be
d
 
<EOS>
d
to
you
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
catch
Hepburn
by
the
shoulder
,
and
give
him
a
push
.
<EOS>
Philip
stumble
over
something
in
this
,
his
force
run
.
<EOS>
He
look
down
;
his
foot
have
catch
in
Kinraid
's
hat
,
which
have
drop
off
in
the
previous
struggle
.
<EOS>
in
the
band
that
go
round
the
low
crown
,
a
ribbon
be
knot
;
a
piece
of
that
same
ribbon
which
Philip
have
choose
out
,
with
such
tender
hope
,
to
give
to
Sylvia
for
the
Corneys
'
party
on
new
year
's
eve
.
<EOS>
He
know
every
delicate
thread
that
make
up
the
briar
-
rise
pattern
;
and
a
spasm
of
hatred
towards
Kinraid
contract
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
almost
relent
into
pity
for
the
man
capture
before
his
eye
;
now
he
abhor
him
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
do
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
,
who
have
begin
to
take
him
into
favour
,
be
all
agog
with
curiosity
to
hear
the
message
to
his
sweetheart
,
which
they
believe
he
be
go
to
send
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
's
perception
,
quicken
with
his
vehement
agitation
of
soul
,
be
aware
of
this
feeling
of
theirs
;
and
it
increase
his
rage
against
Kinraid
,
who
have
expose
the
idea
of
Sylvia
to
be
the
subject
of
ribald
whisper
.
<EOS>
but
the
specksioneer
care
little
what
other
say
or
think
about
the
maiden
,
whom
he
yet
see
before
his
closed
eyelid
as
she
stand
watch
him
,
from
the
Haytersbank
gully
,
wave
her
hand
,
her
handkerchief
,
all
in
one
passionate
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
yo
'
want
wi

me
?
"
ask
Hepburn
at
last
in
a
gloomy
tone
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
help
it
,
he
would
have
keep
silence
till
Kinraid
speak
first
;
but
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
sailor
'
nudge
,
and
winks
,
and
jest
among
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"

Kinraid
      
<EOS>
"
there
be
a

one
of

straight
on

anxious
about
my

<EOS>
one
of
the
sailor
laugh
at
this
rude
humour
;
another
bade
Carter
hold
his
stupid
tongue
.
<EOS>
Philip
hate
him
in
his
heart

<EOS>
Kinraid
hardly
hear
him

He
be
grow
faint
with
the
heavy
blow
he
have
receive
,
the
stunning
fall
he
have
meet
with
,
and
the
reaction
from
his
dogged

at
first

<EOS>
Philip
do
not

<EOS>
Philip
say
something
inarticulately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hurra

<EOS>
cry
Carter
,
"

I
will
be
good

<EOS>
"
Yo'll
have
yo'r

full

then

mutter
Philip
,
his
passion
boil
over
at
the
thought
of
have
be
choose
out
from
among
all
man
to
convey
such
a
message
as
Kinraid
's
to
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
make

"
say
the
man
who
have
be
hurt
by
Kinraid
,
and
who
have
sate
apart
and
silent
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
turn
away
;
Kinraid
raise
himself
and
cry
after
him
,
    
"
Hepburn
,
Hepburn
!
<EOS>
tell
her
   
'
what
he
add
Philip
could
not
hear
,
for
the
word
be
lose
before
they
reach
him
in
the
outward
noise
of
the
regular
splash
of
the
oar
and
the
rush
of
the
wind
down
the
gully
,
with
which
mingle
the
close
sound
that
fill
his
ear
of
his
own
hurrying
blood
surge
up
into
his
brain

<EOS>
He
be
conscious
that
he
have
say
something
in
reply
to
Kinraid
's
adjuration
that
he
would
deliver
his
message
to
Sylvia
,
at
the
very
time
when
Carter
have
sting
him
into
fresh
anger
by
the
allusion
to
the
possibility
of
the
specksioneer
's
"
run
after
other
girl
,
"
for
,
for
an
instant
,
Hepburn
have
be
touch
by
the
contrast
of
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
an
hour
or
two
ago
,
 
Kinraid
a
banished
man
;
for
in
those
day
,
an
impressed
sailor
may
linger
out
year
on
some
foreign
station
,
far
from
those
he
love
,
who
all
this
time
remain
ignorant
of
his
cruel
fate
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hepburn
begin
to
wonder
what
he
himself
have
say
 
how
much
of
a
promise
he
have
make
to
deliver
those
last
passionate
word
of
Kinraid
's
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
recollect
how
much
,
how
little
he
have
say
;
he
know
he
have
speak
hoarsely
and
low
almost
at
the
same
time
as
Carter
have
utter
his
loud
joke
.
<EOS>
but
he
doubt
if
Kinraid
have
catch
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
dread
Inner
Creature
,
who
lurk
in
each
of
our
heart
,
arise
and
say
,
"
It
be
as
well
:
a
promise
give
be
a
fetter
to
the
giver
.
<EOS>
but
a
promise
be
not
give
when
it
have
not
be
receive
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
a
sudden
impulse
,
he
turn
again
towards
the
shore
when
he
have
cross
the
bridge
,
and
almost
run
towards
the
verge
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
then
he
throw
himself
down
on
the
soft
fine
turf
that
grow
on
the
margin
of
the
cliff
overhang
the
sea
,
and
command
an
extent
of
view
towards
the
north
.
<EOS>
His
face
support
by
his
hand
,
he
look
down
upon
the
blue
ripple
ocean
,
flash
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
into
the
sunlight
in
long
,
glitter
line
.
<EOS>
the
boat
be
still
in
the
distance
,
make
her
swift
silent
way
with
long
regular
bound
to
the
tender
that
lie
in
the
offing
.
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
feel
insecure
,
as
in
a
nightmare
dream
,
so
long
as
the
boat
do
not
reach
her
immediate
destination
.
<EOS>
His
contract
eye
could
see
four
minute
figure
row
with
ceaseless
motion
,
and
a
fifth
sate
at
the
helm
.
<EOS>
but
he
know
there
be
a
sixth
,
unseen
,
lying
,
bound
and
helpless
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
;
and
his
fancy
keep
expect
this
man
to
start
up
and
break
his
bond
,
and
overcome
all
the
other
,
and
return
to
the
shore
free
and
triumphant
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
fault
of
Hepburn
's
that
the
boat
speed
well
away
;
that
she
be
now
alongside
the
tender
,
dance
on
the
wave
;
now
empty
of
her
crew
;
now
hoist
up
to
her
place
.
<EOS>
no
fault
of
his
!
<EOS>
and
yet
it
take
him
some
time
before
he
could
reason
himself
into
the
belief
that
his
mad
,
feverish
wish
not
an
hour
before
 
his
wild
prayer
to
be
rid
of
his
rival
,
as
he
himself
have
scramble
onward
over
the
rock
alongside
of
Kinraid
's
path
on
the
sand
 
have
not
compel
the
event
.
  
<EOS>
"
anyhow
,
"
think
he
,
as
he
rise
up
,
"
my
prayer
be
grant
.
<EOS>
God
be
thank
!
"
  
<EOS>
once
more
he
look
out
towards
the
ship
.
<EOS>
She
have
spread
her
beautiful
great
sail
,
and
be
stand
out
to
sea
in
the
glitter
path
of
the
descend
sun
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
that
he
have
be
delay
on
his
road
,
and
have
linger
long
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
stiffened
limb
,
shoulder
his
knapsack
,
and
prepare
to
walk
on
to
Hartlepool
as
swiftly
as
he
could
.
    
<EOS>
an
important
mission
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
too
late
for
the
coach
he
have
hope
to
go
by
,
but
there
be
another
that
leave
at
night
,
and
which
reach
Newcastle
in
the
forenoon
,
so
that
,
by
the
loss
of
a
night
's
sleep
,
he
may
overtake
his
lose
time
.
<EOS>
but
,
restless
and
miserable
,
he
could
not
stop
in
Hartlepool
longer
than
to
get
some
hasty
food
at
the
inn
from
which
the
coach
start
.
<EOS>
He
acquaint
himself
with
the
name
of
the
town
through
which
it
would
pass
,
and
the
inn
at
which
it
would
stop
,
and
leave
word
that
the
coachman
be
to
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
and
pick
him
up
at
some
one
of
these
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
wear
out
before
this
happen
 
too
much
tired
to
gain
any
sleep
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
Newcastle
,
he
go
to
engage
his
passage
in
the
next
London
-
bind
smack
,
and
then
direct
his
step
to
Robinson
's
,
in
the
side
,
to
make
all
the
inquiry
he
could
think
of
respect
the
plough
his
uncle
want
to
know
about
.
  
<EOS>
so
it
be
pretty
late
in
the
afternoon
,
indeed
almost
evening
,
before
he
arrive
at
the
small
inn
on
the
quay
-
side
,
where
he
intend
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
rough
kind
of
place
,
frequent
principally
by
sailor
;
he
have
be
recommend
to
it
by
Daniel
Robson
,
who
have
know
it
well
in
former
day
.
<EOS>
the
accommodation
in
it
be
,
however
,
clean
and
homely
,
and
the
people
keep
it
be
respectable
enough
in
their
way
.
  
<EOS>
still
Hepburn
be
rather
repel
by
the
appearance
of
the
sailor
who
sate
drink
in
the
bar
,
and
he
ask
,
in
a
low
voice
,
if
there
be
not
another
room
.
<EOS>
the
woman
stare
in
surprise
,
and
only
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
go
to
a
separate
table
,
away
from
the
roar
fire
,
which
on
this
cold
March
evening
be
the
great
attraction
,
and
call
for
food
and
drink
.
<EOS>
then
see
that
the
other
man
be
eye
him
with
the
sociable
idea
of
speak
to
him
,
he
ask
for
pen
and
ink
and
paper
,
with
the
intention
of
defeat
their
purpose
by
pre
-
occupation
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
paper
come
,
the
new
pen
,
the
unused
thickened
ink
,
he
hesitate
long
before
he
begin
to
write
;
and
at
last
he
slowly
put
down
the
word
,
    
"
DEAR
and
HONOURED
uncle
,
"
      
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
;
his
meal
be
bring
and
hastily
swallow
.
<EOS>
even
while
he
be
eat
it
,
he
keep
occasionally
touch
up
the
letter
of
these
word
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
drink
a
glass
of
ale
<EOS>
he
begin
again
to
write
:
fluently
this
time
,
for
he
be
give
an
account
of
the
plough
.
<EOS>
then
come
another
long
stop
;
he
be
weigh
in
his
own
mind
what
he
should
say
about
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
once
he
think
for
a
second
of
writing
to
Sylvia
herself
,
and
tell
her
   
how
much
?
<EOS>
She
may
treasure
up
her
lover
's
word
like
grain
of
gold
,
while
they
be
light
than
dust
in
their
meaning
to
Philip
's
mind
;
word
which
such
as
the
specksioneer
use
as
counter
to
beguile
and
lead
astray
silly
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
him
to
prove
his
constancy
by
action
;
and
the
chance
of
his
give
such
proof
be
infinitesimal
in
Philip
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
but
should
the
latter
mention
the
bare
fact
of
Kinraid
's
impressment
to
Robson
?
<EOS>
that
would
have
be
the
natural
course
of
thing
,
remember
that
the
last
time
Philip
have
see
either
,
they
be
in
each
other
's
company
.
<EOS>
twenty
time
he
put
his
pen
to
the
paper
with
the
intention
of
relate
briefly
the
event
that
have
befall
Kinraid
;
and
as
often
he
stop
,
as
though
the
first
word
would
be
irrevocable
.
<EOS>
while
he
thus
sate
pen
in
hand
,
think
himself
wise
than
conscience
,
and
look
on
beyond
the
next
step
which
she
bid
him
take
into
an
indefinite
future
,
he
catch
some
fragment
of
the
sailor
'
talk
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
which
make
him
listen
to
their
word
.
<EOS>
They
be
speak
of
that
very
Kinraid
,
the
thought
of
whom
fill
his
own
mind
like
an
actual
presence
.
<EOS>
in
a
rough
,
careless
way
they
speak
of
the
specksioneer
,
with
admiration
enough
for
his
power
as
a
sailor
and
harpooner
;
and
from
that
they
pass
on
to
jest
mention
of
his
power
amongst
woman
,
and
one
or
two
girl
'
name
be
speak
of
in
connection
with
him
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
silently
add
Annie
Coulson
and
Sylvia
Robson
to
this
list
,
and
his
cheek
turn
paler
as
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
long
after
they
have
do
speak
about
Kinraid
,
after
they
have
pay
their
shot
,
and
go
away
,
he
sate
in
the
same
attitude
,
think
bitter
thought
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
house
prepare
for
bed
.
<EOS>
Their
silent
guest
take
no
heed
of
their
mute
sign
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
landlord
speak
to
him
,
and
he
start
,
gather
his
wit
together
with
an
effort
,
and
prepare
to
retire
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
do
so
,
he
sign
and
direct
the
letter
to
his
uncle
,
leave
it
still
open
,
however
,
in
case
some
sudden
feeling
should
prompt
him
to
add
a
postscript
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
volunteer
the
information
that
the
letter
his
guest
have
be
write
must
be
post
early
the
next
morning
if
it
be
go
south
;
as
the
mail
in
that
direction
only
leave
Newcastle
every
other
day
.
  
<EOS>
all
night
long
Hepburn
weary
himself
with
passionate
tossing
,
prompt
by
sting
recollection
.
<EOS>
towards
morning
he
fall
into
a
dead
sound
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
be
rouse
by
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
broad
full
daylight
;
he
have
oversleep
himself
,
and
the
smack
be
leave
by
the
early
tide
.
<EOS>
He
be
even
now
summon
on
board
.
<EOS>
He
dress
,
wafere
his
letter
,
and
rush
with
it
to
the
neighbouring
post
-
office
;
and
,
without
care
to
touch
the
breakfast
for
which
he
pay
,
he
embark
.
<EOS>
once
on
board
,
he
experience
the
relief
which
it
always
be
to
an
undecided
man
,
and
generally
be
at
first
to
any
one
who
have
be
palter
with
duty
,
when
circumstance
decide
for
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
case
,
it
be
pleasant
to
be
relieve
from
the
burden
of
decision
;
in
the
second
,
the
responsibility
seem
to
be
shift
on
to
impersonal
event
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Philip
sail
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
on
to
the
great
open
sea
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
week
before
the
smack
reach
London
,
even
if
she
pursue
a
tolerably
straight
course
,
but
she
have
to
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
after
possible
impressment
of
her
crew
;
and
it
be
not
until
after
many
dodge
and
some
adventure
that
,
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
from
the
time
of
his
leave
Monkshaven
,
Philip
find
himself
safely
house
in
London
,
and
ready
to
begin
the
delicate
piece
of
work
which
be
give
him
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
fully
capable
of
unravel
each
clue
to
information
,
and
decide
on
the
value
of
the
knowledge
so
gain
.
<EOS>
but
during
the
leisure
of
the
voyage
he
have
wisely
determine
to
communicate
everything
he
learn
about
Dickinson
,
in
short
,
every
step
he
take
in
the
matter
,
by
letter
to
his
employer
.
<EOS>
and
thus
his
mind
both
in
and
out
of
his
lodging
may
have
appear
to
have
be
fully
occupy
with
the
concern
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
time
when
the
miserable
luxury
of
dwell
upon
his
own
affair
be
his
 
when
he
lie
down
in
his
bed
till
he
fall
into
restless
sleep
 
when
the
point
to
which
his
step
tend
in
his
walk
be
ascertain
.
<EOS>
then
he
give
himself
up
to
memory
,
and
regret
which
often
deepen
into
despair
,
and
but
seldom
be
cheer
by
hope
.
  
<EOS>
He
grow
so
impatient
of
the
ignorance
in
which
he
be
keep
 
for
in
those
day
of
heavy
postage
<EOS>
any
correspondence
he
may
have
have
on
mere
Monkshaven
intelligence
be
very
limited
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
affair
at
Haytersbank
,
that
he
cut
out
an
advertisement
respect
some
new
kind
of
plough
,
from
a
newspaper
that
lie
in
the
chop
-
house
where
he
usually
dine
,
and
rise
early
the
next
morning
he
employ
the
time
thus
gain
in
go
round
to
the
shop
where
these
new
plough
be
sell
.
  
<EOS>
that
night
he
write
another
letter
to
Daniel
Robson
,
with
a
long
account
of
the
merit
of
the
implement
he
have
that
day
see
.
<EOS>
with
a
sick
heart
and
a
hesitating
hand
,
he
wind
up
with
a
message
of
regard
to
his
aunt
and
to
Sylvia
;
an
expression
of
regard
which
he
dare
not
make
as
warm
as
he
wish
,
and
which
,
consequently
,
fall
below
the
usual
mark
attain
by
such
message
,
and
would
have
appear
to
any
one
who
care
to
think
about
it
as
cold
and
formal
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
letter
be
despatch
,
Hepburn
begin
to
wonder
what
he
have
hope
for
in
write
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
Daniel
could
write
 
or
rather
that
he
could
make
strange
hieroglyphic
,
the
meaning
of
which
puzzle
other
and
often
himself
;
but
these
pen
-
and
-
ink
sign
be
seldom
employ
by
Robson
,
and
never
,
so
far
as
Philip
know
,
for
the
purpose
of
letter
-
writing
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
crave
so
for
news
of
Sylvia
 
even
for
a
sight
of
paper
which
she
have
see
,
and
perhaps
touch
 
that
he
think
all
his
trouble
about
the
plough
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
one
-
and
-
twopence
postage
which
he
have
prepay
in
order
to
make
sure
of
his
letter
's
reception
in
the
frugal
household
at
Haytersbank
)
well
lose
for
the
mere
chance
of
his
uncle
's
care
enough
for
the
intelligence
to
write
in
reply
,
or
even
to
get
some
friend
to
write
an
answer
;
for
in
such
case
,
perhaps
,
Philip
may
see
her
name
mention
in
some
way
,
even
though
it
be
only
that
she
send
her
duty
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
post
-
office
be
dumb
;
no
letter
come
from
Daniel
Robson
.
<EOS>
Philip
hear
,
it
be
true
,
from
his
employer
pretty
frequently
on
business
;
and
he
feel
sure
they
would
have
name
it
,
if
any
ill
have
befall
his
uncle
's
family
,
for
they
know
of
the
relationship
and
of
his
intimacy
there
.
<EOS>
They
generally
end
their
formal
letter
with
as
formal
a
summary
of
Monkshaven
news
;
but
there
be
never
a
mention
of
the
Robsons
,
and
that
of
itself
be
well
,
but
it
do
not
soothe
Philip
's
impatient
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
confide
his
attachment
to
his
cousin
to
any
one
,
it
be
not
his
way
;
but
he
sometimes
think
that
if
Coulson
have
not
take
his
present
appointment
to
a
confidential
piece
of
employment
so
ill
,
he
would
have
write
to
him
and
ask
him
to
go
up
to
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
let
him
know
how
they
all
be
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
he
be
transact
the
affair
on
which
he
have
be
send
,
with
great
skill
;
and
,
indeed
,
in
several
way
,
he
be
quietly
lay
the
foundation
for
enlarge
the
business
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
naturally
grave
and
quiet
,
and
slow
to
speak
,
he
impress
those
who
see
him
with
the
idea
of
great
age
and
experience
than
he
really
possess
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
those
who
encounter
him
in
London
,
think
he
be
absorb
in
the
business
of
money
-
making
.
<EOS>
yet
before
the
time
come
when
he
could
wind
up
affair
and
return
to
Monkshaven
,
he
would
have
give
all
he
possess
for
a
letter
from
his
uncle
,
tell
him
something
about
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
for
he
still
hope
to
hear
from
Robson
,
although
he
know
that
he
hope
against
reason
.
<EOS>
but
we
often
convince
ourselves
by
good
argument
that
what
we
wish
for
need
never
have
be
expect
;
and
then
,
at
the
end
of
our
reasoning
,
find
that
we
may
have
save
ourselves
the
trouble
,
for
that
our
wish
be
untouched
,
and
be
as
strong
enemy
to
our
peace
of
mind
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
's
baulked
hope
be
the
Mordecai
sit
in
Haman
's
gate
;
all
his
success
in
his
errand
to
London
,
his
well
-
doing
in
worldly
affair
,
be
tasteless
,
and
give
him
no
pleasure
,
because
of
this
blank
and
void
of
all
intelligence
concern
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
he
come
back
with
a
letter
from
the
Fosters
in
his
pocket
,
curt
,
yet
expressive
of
deep
gratitude
for
his
discreet
service
in
London
;
and
at
another
time
 
in
fact
,
if
Philip
's
life
have
be
order
differently
to
what
it
be
 
<EOS>
it
may
have
give
this
man
a
not
unworthy
pleasure
to
remember
that
,
without
a
penny
of
his
own
,
simply
by
diligence
,
honesty
,
and
faithful
quick
-
sightedness
as
to
the
interest
of
his
master
<EOS>
,
he
have
rise
to
hold
the
promise
of
be
their
successor
,
and
to
be
rank
by
them
as
a
trust
friend
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
Newcastle
smack
near
the
shore
on
her
voyage
home
,
Hepburn
look
wistfully
out
for
the
faint
gray
outline
of
Monkshaven
Priory
against
the
sky
,
and
the
well
-
know
cliff
;
as
if
the
masse
of
inanimate
stone
could
tell
him
any
news
of
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
street
of
shield
,
just
after
landing
,
he
encounter
a
neighbour
of
the
Robsons
,
and
an
acquaintance
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
by
this
honest
man
,
he
be
welcome
as
a
great
traveller
be
welcome
on
his
return
from
a
long
voyage
,
with
many
hearty
good
shake
of
the
hand
,
much
repetition
of
kind
wish
,
and
offer
to
treat
him
to
drink
.
<EOS>
yet
,
from
some
insurmountable
feeling
,
Philip
avoid
all
mention
of
the
family
who
be
the
principal
bond
between
the
honest
farmer
and
himself
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
why
,
but
he
could
not
bear
the
shock
of
first
hear
her
name
in
the
open
street
,
or
in
the
rough
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
and
thus
he
shrink
from
the
intelligence
he
crave
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
thus
he
know
no
more
about
the
Robsons
when
he
return
to
Monkshaven
,
than
he
have
do
on
the
day
when
he
have
last
see
them
;
and
,
of
course
,
his
first
task
there
be
to
give
a
long
_
viva
<EOS>
voce
<EOS>
_
account
of
all
his
London
proceeding
to
the
two
brother
Foster
,
who
,
consider
that
they
have
hear
the
result
of
everything
by
letter
,
seem
to
take
an
insatiable
interest
in
detail
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
tell
why
,
but
even
when
release
from
the
foster
'
parlour
,
he
be
unwilling
to
go
to
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
It
be
late
,
it
be
true
,
but
on
a
May
evening
even
country
people
keep
up
till
eight
or
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
because
Hepburn
be
still
in
his
travel
-
stain
dress
;
have
go
straight
to
the
shop
on
his
arrival
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
because
,
if
he
go
this
night
for
the
short
half
-
hour
intervening
before
bed
-
time
,
he
would
have
no
excuse
for
pay
a
long
visit
on
the
follow
evening
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
proceed
straight
to
Alice
Rose
's
,
as
soon
as
he
have
finish
his
interview
with
his
employer
.
  
<EOS>
both
Hester
and
Coulson
have
give
him
their
welcome
home
in
the
shop
,
which
they
have
,
however
,
leave
an
hour
or
two
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
yet
they
give
him
a
fresh
greeting
,
almost
one
in
which
surprise
be
blend
,
when
he
come
to
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
even
Alice
seem
gratified
by
his
spending
this
first
evening
with
them
,
as
if
she
have
think
it
may
have
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
weary
though
he
be
,
he
exert
himself
to
talk
and
to
relate
what
he
have
do
and
see
in
London
,
as
far
as
he
could
without
break
confidence
with
his
employer
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
see
the
pleasure
he
give
to
his
auditor
,
although
there
be
several
mixed
feeling
in
their
mind
to
produce
the
expression
of
it
which
gratify
him
.
<EOS>
Coulson
be
sorry
for
his
former
ungenerous
reception
of
the
news
that
Philip
be
go
to
London
;
Hester
and
her
mother
each
secretly
begin
to
feel
as
if
this
evening
be
like
more
happy
evening
of
old
,
before
the
Robsons
come
to
Haytersbank
Farm
;
and
who
know
what
faint
delicious
hope
this
resemblance
may
not
have
suggest
?
  
<EOS>
while
Philip
,
restless
and
excited
,
feel
that
he
could
not
sleep
,
be
glad
to
pass
away
the
wake
hour
that
must
intervene
before
to
-
morrow
night
,
at
time
,
he
try
to
make
them
talk
of
what
have
happen
in
Monkshaven
during
his
absence
,
but
all
have
go
on
in
an
eventless
manner
,
as
far
as
he
could
gather
;
if
they
know
of
anything
affect
the
Robsons
,
they
avoid
speak
of
it
to
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
how
little
likely
be
they
ever
to
have
hear
their
name
while
he
be
away
?
    
<EOS>
LOVED
and
LOST
  
<EOS>
Philip
walk
towards
the
Robsons
'
farm
like
a
man
in
a
dream
,
who
have
everything
around
him
accord
to
his
wish
,
and
yet
be
conscious
of
a
secret
mysterious
inevitable
drawback
to
his
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
do
not
care
to
think
 
would
not
realize
what
this
drawback
,
which
need
not
have
be
mysterious
in
his
case
,
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
May
evening
be
glorious
in
light
and
shadow
.
<EOS>
the
crimson
sun
warm
up
the
chilly
northern
air
to
a
semblance
of
pleasant
heat
.
<EOS>
the
spring
sight
and
sound
be
all
about
;
the
lamb
be
bleat
out
their
gentle
weariness
before
they
sink
to
rest
by
the
side
of
their
mother
;
the
linnet
be
chirp
in
every
bush
of
golden
gorse
that
grow
out
of
the
stone
wall
;
the
lark
be
singe
her
good
-
night
in
the
cloudless
sky
,
before
she
drop
down
to
her
nest
in
the
tender
green
wheat
;
all
speak
of
brood
peace
 
but
Philip
's
heart
be
not
at
peace
.
  
<EOS>
yet
he
be
go
to
proclaim
his
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
His
master
have
that
day
publicly
announce
that
Coulson
and
he
be
to
be
their
successor
,
and
he
have
now
arrive
at
that
long
-
for
point
in
his
business
,
when
he
have
resolve
to
openly
speak
of
his
love
to
Sylvia
,
and
may
openly
strive
to
gain
her
love
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
fulfilment
of
that
wish
of
his
have
lag
sadly
behind
.
<EOS>
He
be
place
as
far
as
he
could
,
even
in
his
most
sanguine
moment
,
have
hope
to
be
as
regard
business
,
but
Sylvia
be
as
far
from
his
attainment
as
ever
 
nay
,
farther
.
<EOS>
still
the
great
obstacle
be
remove
in
Kinraid
's
impressment
.
<EOS>
Philip
take
upon
himself
to
decide
that
,
with
such
a
man
as
the
specksioneer
,
absence
be
equivalent
to
faithless
forgetfulness
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
have
just
ground
for
this
decision
in
the
account
he
have
hear
of
Kinraid
's
behaviour
to
Annie
Coulson
;
to
the
other
nameless
young
girl
,
her
successor
in
his
fickle
heart
;
in
the
ribald
talk
of
the
sailor
in
the
Newcastle
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
for
Sylvia
if
she
could
forget
as
quickly
;
and
,
to
promote
this
oblivion
,
the
name
of
her
lover
should
never
be
bring
up
,
either
in
praise
or
blame
.
<EOS>
and
Philip
would
be
patient
and
enduring
;
all
the
time
watch
over
her
,
and
labour
to
win
her
reluctant
love
.
  
<EOS>
there
she
be
!
<EOS>
He
see
her
as
he
stand
at
the
top
of
the
little
hill
-
path
lead
down
to
the
Robsons
'
door
.
<EOS>
She
be
out
of
door
,
in
the
garden
,
which
,
at
some
distance
from
the
house
,
slope
up
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gully
;
much
too
far
off
to
be
speak
to
 
not
too
far
off
to
be
gaze
at
by
eye
that
caress
her
every
movement
.
<EOS>
how
well
Philip
know
that
garden
;
place
long
ago
by
some
tenant
of
the
farm
on
a
southern
slope
;
wall
in
with
rough
moorland
stone
;
plant
with
berry
-
bush
for
use
,
and
southernwood
and
sweet
-
briar
for
sweetness
of
smell
.
<EOS>
when
the
Robsons
have
first
come
to
Haytersbank
,
and
Sylvia
be
scarcely
more
than
a
pretty
child
,
how
well
he
remember
help
her
with
the
arrangement
of
this
garden
;
lay
out
his
few
spare
penny
in
hen
-
and
-
chicken
daisy
at
one
time
,
in
flower
-
seed
at
another
;
again
in
a
rose
-
tree
in
a
pot
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
his
unaccustomed
hand
have
labour
with
the
spade
at
form
a
little
primitive
bridge
over
the
beck
in
the
hollow
before
winter
stream
should
make
it
too
deep
for
ford
;
how
he
have
cut
down
branch
of
the
mountain
-
ash
and
cover
them
over
,
yet
deck
with
their
scarlet
berry
,
with
sod
of
green
turf
,
beyond
which
the
brilliancy
creep
out
;
but
now
it
be
month
and
year
since
he
have
be
in
that
garden
,
which
have
lose
its
charm
for
Sylvia
,
as
she
find
the
bleak
sea
-
wind
come
up
and
blight
all
endeavour
at
cultivate
more
than
the
most
useful
thing
 
pot
-
herb
,
marigold
,
potato
,
onion
,
and
such
-
like
.
<EOS>
why
do
she
tarry
there
now
,
stand
quite
motionless
up
by
the
high
bit
of
wall
,
look
over
the
sea
,
with
her
hand
shade
her
eye
?
<EOS>
quite
motionless
;
as
if
she
be
a
stone
statue
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
wish
she
would
move
 
would
look
at
him
 
but
any
way
that
she
would
move
,
and
not
stand
gaze
thus
over
that
great
dreary
sea
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
down
the
path
with
an
impatient
step
,
and
enter
the
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
there
sit
his
aunt
spinning
,
and
apparently
as
well
as
ever
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
his
uncle
talk
to
Kester
in
the
neighbouring
shippen
;
all
be
well
in
the
household
.
<EOS>
why
be
Sylvia
stand
in
the
garden
in
that
strange
quiet
way
?
  
<EOS>
"

Could

have

after

and

kill
in
the
attempt

at

he

half
hope

thus
all

<EOS>
Kinraid

He
be
think
a
deal
on
by

when

<EOS>
T

captain
put
off
sailing
for
two
or
three
day
,
that
he
may
ha

much

but
when
he
hear
as

not
at

,
but
have
leave

a'most
on

how

say
Philip

feel
guiltily
disappointed
at

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
I
be
a'most
ashamed

like

I
think
it
be
 
and
t

poor

have
tie
it

there

never

and
in
a
force
make
-
up
voice
she
inquire
aloud
,
for
hitherto
she
have
be
speak
almost
in
a
whisper
,
    
"
and
didst

see
King
George
an

Queen
Charlotte

"
  
<EOS>
Philip
could
not
answer
 
do
not
hear
.
<EOS>
His
soul
have
go
out
to
meet
Sylvia
,
who
enter
with
quiet
slowness
quite
unlike
her
former
self
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
wan
and
white
;
her
gray
eye
seem
large
,
and
full
of
dumb
tearless
sorrow
;
she
come
up
to
Philip
,
as
if
his
be
there
touch
her
with
no
surprise
,
and
give
him
a
gentle
greeting
as
if
he
be
a
familiar
indifferent
person
whom
she
have
see
but
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
who
have
recollect
the
quarrel
they
have
have
,
and
about
Kinraid
too
,
the
very
last
time
they
have
meet
,
have
expect
some
trace
of
this
remembrance
to
linger
in
her
look
and
speech
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
such
sign
;
her
great
sorrow
have
wipe
away
all
anger
,
almost
all
memory
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
look
at
her
anxiously
,
and
then
say
in
the
same
manner
of
force
cheerfulness
which
she
have
use
before
,
    
<EOS>
"
here
be
Philip

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
silent
and
docile
,
go
out
to
the
shippen
to
obey
her
mother
's
wish
.
<EOS>
Bell
Robson
lean
forward
towards
Philip
,
misinterpret
the
expression
on
his
face
,
which
be
guilt
as
much
as
sympathy
,
and
check
the
possible
repentance
which
may
have
urge
him
on
at
that
moment
to
tell
all
he
know
,
by
say
,
"
Lad

<EOS>
it

He

good
enough

I
misdoubt
me
he

her
as
he
would
do
by
other
.
<EOS>
let
her

let
her
a

;
she
will
come
round
to
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Robson
bustle
in
with
loud
welcome
;
all
the
loud
and
more
talkative
because
he
,
like
his
wife
,
assume
a
cheerful
manner
before
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
yet
he
,
unlike
his
wife
,
have
many
a
secret
regret
over
Kinraid
's
fate
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
while
merely
the
fact
of
his
disappearance
be
know
,
Daniel
Robson
have
hit
on
the
truth
,
and
have
stick
to
his
opinion
that
the
cursed
press
-
gang
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
back
his
word
by
many
an
oath
,
and
all
the
more
because
he
have
not
a
single
reason
to
give
that
apply
to
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
no
one
on
the
lonely
coast
have
remark
any
sign
of
the
presence
of
the
man
-
of
-
war
,
or
the
tender
that
accompany
them
,
for
the
purpose
of
impressment
on
the
king
's
ship
.
<EOS>
at
Shields
,
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
,
where
they
lie
in
greedy
wait
,
the
owner
of
the
_
Urania
_
have
cause
strict
search
to
be
make
for
their
skilled
and
protect
specksioneer
,
but
with
no
success
.
<EOS>
all
this
positive
evidence
in
contradiction
to
Daniel
Robson
's
opinion
only
make
him
cling
to
it
the
more
;
until
the
day
when
the
hat
be
find
on
the
shore
with
Kinraid
's
name
write
out
large
and
fair
in
the
inside
,
and
the
tell
-
tale
bit
of
ribbon
knot
in
the
band
.
<EOS>
then
Daniel
,
by
a
sudden
revulsion
,
give
up
every
hope
;
it
never
enter
his
mind
that
it
could
have
fall
off
by
any
accident
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
now
Kinraid
be
dead
and
drown
,
and
it
be
a
bad
job
,
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
forget
the
well
for
all
party
;
and
it
be
well
<EOS>
no
one
know
how
far
it
have
go
with
Sylvia
,
especially
now
since
Bessy
Corney
be
cry
her
eye
out
as
if
he
have
be
engage
to
her
.
<EOS>
so
Daniel
say
nothing
to
his
wife
about
the
mischief
that
have
go
on
in
her
absence
,
and
never
speak
to
Sylvia
about
the
affair
;
only
he
be
more
than
usually
tender
to
her
in
his
rough
way
,
and
think
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
on
what
he
could
do
to
give
her
pleasure
,
and
drive
away
all
recollection
of
her
ill
-
starred
love
.
  
<EOS>
to
-
night
he
would
have
her
sit
by
him
while
Philip
tell
his
story
,
or
heavily
answer
question
put
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sit
on
a
stool
by
her
father
's
knee
,
hold
one
of
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
;
and
presently
she
lay
down
her
head
upon
them
,
and
Philip
see
her
sad
eye
look
into
the
flicker
fire
-
light
with
long
unwinking
stare
,
show
that
her
thought
be
far
distant
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
go
on
with
his
tale
of
what
he
have
see
,
and
what
do
,
he
be
so
full
of
pity
for
her
.
<EOS>
yet
,
for
all
his
pity
,
he
have
now
resolve
never
to
soothe
her
with
the
knowledge
of
what
he
know
,
nor
to
deliver
the
message
send
by
her
false
lover
.
<EOS>
He
feel
like
a
mother
withhold
something
injurious
from
the
foolish
wish
of
her
plain
child
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
go
away
without
breathe
a
word
of
his
good
fortune
in
business
.
<EOS>
the
telling
of
such
kind
of
good
fortune
seem
out
of
place
this
night
,
when
the
thought
of
death
and
the
loss
of
friend
seem
to
brood
over
the
household
,
and
cast
its
shadow
there
,
obscure
for
the
time
all
worldly
thing
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
great
piece
of
news
come
out
in
the
ordinary
course
of
gossip
,
tell
by
some
Monkshaven
friend
to
Robson
the
next
market
day
.
<EOS>
for
month
Philip
have
be
look
forward
to
the
sensation
which
the
intelligence
would
produce
in
the
farm
household
,
as
a
preliminary
to
lay
his
good
fortune
at
Sylvia
's
foot
.
<EOS>
and
they
hear
of
it
,
and
he
away
,
and
all
chance
of
his
make
use
of
it
in
the
manner
he
have
intend
vanish
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
be
always
curious
after
other
people
's
affair
,
and
now
be
more
than
ever
bent
on
collect
scrap
of
news
which
may
possibly
interest
Sylvia
,
and
rouse
her
out
of
the
state
of
indifference
as
to
everything
into
which
she
have
fall
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
think
that
he
have
not
act
altogether
wisely
in
allow
her
to
engage
herself
to
Kinraid
,
for
he
be
a
man
apt
to
judge
by
result
;
and
moreover
he
have
have
so
much
reason
to
repent
of
the
encouragement
which
he
have
give
to
the
lover
whose
untimely
end
have
so
deeply
affect
his
only
child
,
that
he
be
more
unwilling
than
ever
that
his
wife
should
know
of
the
length
to
which
the
affair
have
go
during
her
absence
.
<EOS>
He
even
urge
secrecy
upon
Sylvia
as
a
personal
favour
;
unwilling
to
encounter
the
silent
blame
which
he
openly
affect
to
despise
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
noane
fret
thy
mother
by
lettin

on
how
oft
he

and
go
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

for

to
thee
,
my
poor
lass

an
'
it
would
put
her
out
a
deal
,
for
she
be
a
woman
of
a
stern
mind
towards

<EOS>
and
she
will
be
noane
so
strong
till

I
would
be
loath
to
give
her

thee

me
will

<EOS>
"
I
wish

she

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
more
he
do
;
but
there
be
a
strange
tenderness
in
his
tone
when
he
speak
to
her
;
a
half
-
pathetic
way
of
seek
after
her
,
if
by
any
chance
she
be
absent
for
a
minute
from
the
place
where
he
expect
to
find
her
;
a
consideration
for
her
,
about
this
time
,
in
his
way
of
bring
back
trifling
present
,
or
small
piece
of
news
that
he
think
may
interest
her
,
which
sink
deep
into
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
ask
he
,
almost
before
he
have
take
off
his
coat
,
on
the
day
when
he
have
hear
of
Philip

promotion
in
the

still

<EOS>
a
rejected
SUITOR
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
domestic
arrangement
to
be
make
in
connection
with
the
new
commercial
one
which
affect
Hepburn
and
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
the
Fosters
,
with
something
of
the
busybodiness
which
be
apt
to
mingle
itself
with
kindly
patronage
,
have
plan
in
their
own
mind
that
the
Rose
household
should
be
remove
altogether
to
the
house
belong
to
the
shop
;
and
that
Alice
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
capable
servant
,
who
,
at
present
,
manage
all
John
's
domestic
affair
,
should
continue
as
mistress
of
the
house
,
with
Philip
and
Coulson
for
her
lodger
.
  
<EOS>
but
arrangement
without
her
consent
do
not
suit
Alice
at
any
time
,
and
she
have
very
good
reason
for
decline
to
accede
to
this
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
go
to
be
uproot
at
her
time
of
life
,
she
say
,
nor
would
she
consent
to
enter
upon
a
future
which
may
be
so
uncertain
.
<EOS>
why
,
Hepburn
and
Coulson
be
both
young
man
,
she
say
,
and
they
be
as
likely
to
marry
as
not
;
and
then
the
bride
would
be
sure
to
wish
to
live
in
the
good
old
-
fashioned
house
at
the
back
of
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
<EOS>
she
be
tell
by
every
one
concern
,
that
,
in
case
of
such
an
event
,
the
first
married
partner
should
take
a
house
of
his
own
,
leave
her
in
undisputed
possession
.
<EOS>
She
reply
,
with
apparent
truth
,
that
both
may
wish
to
marry
,
and
surely
the
wife
of
one
ought
to
take
possession
of
the
house
belong
to
the
business
;
that
she
be
not
go
to
trust
herself
to
the
fancy
of
young
man
,
who
be
always
,
the
good
of
them
,
go
and
do
the
very
thing
that
be
most
foolish
in
the
way
of
marriage
;
of
which
state
,
in
fact
,
she
speak
with
something
of
acrimonious
contempt
and
dislike
,
as
if
young
people
always
get
mismatch
,
yet
have
not
the
sense
to
let
old
and
wise
people
choose
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'll
not
have
be
understand
why
Alice
Rose
speak
as
she
do
this
morning
,
"
say
Jeremiah
Foster
to
Philip
,
on
the
afternoon
succeed
the
final
discussion
of
this
plan
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
-
thinking
of
her
youth
,
I
reckon
,
when
she
be
a
well
-
favour
young
woman
,
and
our
John
be
full
of
the
thought
of
marry
her
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
have
her
,
he
have
live
a
bachelor
all
his
day
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
not
a
vast
mistaken
,
all
that
he
have
will
go
to
her
and
to
Hester
,
for
all
that
Hester
be
the
child
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
Thee
and
Coulson
should
have
a
try
for
Hester
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
Coulson
this
day
of
Hester
's
chance
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
first
because
he
be
my
wife
's
nephew
;
but
I
tell
thee
now
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
shop
if
one
of
ye
be
married
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
redden
.
<EOS>
often
as
the
idea
of
marriage
have
come
into
his
mind
,
this
be
the
first
time
it
have
be
gravely
suggest
to
him
by
another
.
<EOS>
but
he
reply
quietly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
Hester
Rose
have
any
thought
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
not
;
it
be
for
thee
,
or
for
William
Coulson
,
to
make
her
think
.
<EOS>
She
,
may
-
be
,
remember
enough
of
her
mother
's
life
with
her
father
to
make
her
slow
to
think
on
such
thing
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
her
to
think
on
matrimony
;
it
be
in
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
's
husband
be
dead
before
I
know
her
,
"
say
Philip
,
rather
evade
the
main
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mercy
when
he
be
take
.
<EOS>
a
mercy
to
them
who
be
leave
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
a
bonny
young
woman
,
with
a
smile
for
everybody
,
when
he
we
would
her
 
<EOS>
a
smile
for
every
one
except
our
John
,
who
never
could
do
enough
to
try
and
win
one
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
no
!
<EOS>
she
would
have
none
of
him
,
but
set
her
heart
on
Jack
Rose
,
a
sailor
in
a
whale
-
ship
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
be
marry
at
last
,
though
all
her
own
folk
be
against
it
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
a
profligate
sinner
,
and
go
after
other
woman
,
and
drank
,
and
beat
her
.
<EOS>
She
turn
as
stiff
and
<EOS>
as
grey
as
thou
seest
her
now
within
a
year
of
Hester
's
birth
.
<EOS>
I
believe
they
would
have
perish
for
want
and
cold
many
a
time
if
it
have
not
be
for
John
.
<EOS>
if
she
ever
guess
where
the
money
come
from
,
it
must
have
hurt
her
pride
above
a
bit
,
for
she
be
always
a
proud
woman
.
<EOS>
but
mother
's
love
be
strong
than
pride
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
fall
to
think
;
a
generation
ago
something
of
the
same
kind
have
be
go
on
as
that
which
he
be
now
live
through
,
quick
with
hope
and
fear
.
<EOS>
a
girl
belove
by
two
 
nay
,
those
two
so
identical
in
occupation
as
he
and
Kinraid
be
 
<EOS>
Rose
identical
even
in
character
with
what
he
know
of
the
specksioneer
;
a
girl
choose
the
wrong
lover
,
and
suffering
and
sour
all
her
life
in
consequence
of
her
youth
's
mistake
;
be
that
to
be
Sylvia
's
lot
?
 
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
be
she
not
save
from
it
by
the
event
of
the
impressment
,
and
by
the
course
of
silence
he
himself
have
resolve
upon
?
<EOS>
then
he
go
on
to
wonder
if
the
life
of
one
generation
be
but
a
repetition
of
the
life
of
those
who
have
go
before
,
with
no
variation
but
from
the
internal
cause
that
some
have
great
capacity
for
suffer
than
other
.
<EOS>
Would
those
very
circumstance
which
make
the
interest
of
his
life
now
,
return
,
in
due
cycle
,
when
he
be
dead
and
Sylvia
be
forget
?
  
<EOS>
perplex
thought
of
this
and
a
similar
kind
keep
return
into
Philip
's
mind
whenever
he
have
leisure
to
give
himself
up
to
consideration
of
anything
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
throng
of
business
.
<EOS>
and
every
time
he
dwell
on
this
complication
and
succession
of
similar
event
,
he
emerge
from
his
reverie
more
and
more
satisfied
with
the
course
he
have
take
in
withholding
from
Sylvia
all
knowledge
of
her
lover
's
fate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
settle
at
length
that
Philip
be
to
remove
to
the
house
belong
to
the
shop
,
Coulson
remain
with
Alice
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
course
of
the
summer
the
latter
tell
his
partner
that
he
have
offer
marriage
to
Hester
on
the
previous
day
,
and
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
awkward
affair
altogether
,
as
he
live
in
their
house
,
and
be
in
daily
companionship
with
Hester
,
who
,
however
,
seem
to
preserve
her
gentle
calmness
,
with
only
a
tinge
more
of
reserve
in
her
manner
to
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
yo
'
could
find
out
what
she
have
again
'
me
,
Philip
,
"
say
Coulson
,
about
a
fortnight
after
he
have
make
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
the
poor
young
man
think
that
Hester
's
composure
of
manner
towards
him
since
the
event
argue
that
he
be
not
distasteful
to
her
;
and
as
he
be
now
on
very
happy
term
with
Philip
,
he
come
constantly
to
him
,
as
if
the
latter
could
interpret
the
meaning
of
all
the
little
occurrence
between
him
and
his
beloved
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
o

right
age

not
two

betwixt

there

few
in
Monkshaven

she

I
may
be

Philip

I
dunnut

I
wunnot

It
be
an

be

wi

say
Hepburn
,
reluctantly
.
  
<EOS>

but
thou
say
thee

<EOS>
she
be

"

Philip

"
I
will
see
what
I

I
dunnot

part
o

if

other
fourth

"
  
<EOS>
but
somehow
Philip
could
not
begin
on
the
subject
with
Hester
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
why
,
except
that
,
as
he
say
,
"
it
be
so
awkward
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
really
like
Coulson
so
much
as
to
be
anxious
to
do
what
the
latter
wish
,
although
he
be
almost
convinced
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
so
he
watch
his
opportunity
,
and
find
Alice
alone
and
at
leisure
one
Sunday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
sit
by
the
window
,
read
her
Bible
,
when
he
go
in
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
a
curt
welcome
,
hearty
enough
for
her
,
for
she
be
always
chary
in
her
expression
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
but
she
take
off
her
horn
spectacle
and
place
them
in
the
book
to
keep
her
place
;
and
then
turn
more
fully
round
on
her
chair
,
so
as
to
face
him
,
she
say
,
    
"
well

how
do
it

much

at
him

his

as
well
as
his

to

He
love
her
true

he
be
within

two
on

his

will
bear
handle
on

be
worth
hundred
a

<EOS>
another
pause

<EOS>
Alice
be
try

bring
down
her
pride
to

something
,
which
she

Philip
redden
;
in

he
have
forget
how
he
have
get
to
consider
his
frequent
visit
to
the
farm
as
a
regular
piece

occupation

He
keep
silence

<EOS>
Alice
look
at

I

next

thou

I

just
remember
Alice
Rose
's
word

and
they
be
these
:
 
if
Coulson
's
too
thick
-
sighted
to
see
through
a
board
,
thou'rt
too
blind
to
see
through
a
window

<EOS>
as
for
comin

up
for
Coulson

why
he
will
be
married
to
some
one
else
afore

year
be
out
,
for
all
he
think
he
be
so
set
upon
Hester
now
.
<EOS>
go
thy
way
,
and
leave
me
to
my
scripture

come
no

'
thy
vain
babbling

<EOS>
so
Philip
return
from
his

rather
crestfallen
,

quite
as
far
as

from
"
see
through
a
glass
window

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
before
the
year
be
out
,
Alice
's
prophecy
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
Coulson
,
who
find
the
position
of
a
reject
lover
in
the
same
house
with
the
girl
who
have
refuse
him
,
too
uncomfortable
to
be
endure
,
as
soon
as
he
be
convince
that
his
object
be
decidedly
out
of
his
reach
,
turn
his
attention
to
some
one
else

<EOS>
He
do
not
love
his
new
sweetheart
as
he
have
do
Hester
:
there
be
more
of
reason

less
of
fancy
in

<EOS>

it
end
successfully

before

at

<EOS>
DEEPENING
SHADOWS
  
<EOS>
but
before
Coulson
be
marry
,
many
small
event
happen
 
small
event
to
all
but
Philip
.
<EOS>
to
him
they
be
as
the
sun
and
moon
.
<EOS>
the
day
when
he
go
up
to
Haytersbank
and
Sylvia
speak
to
him
,
the
day
when
he
go
up
<EOS>
and
she
have
apparently
no
heart
to
speak
to
any
one
,
but
leave
the
room
as
soon
as
he
come
,
or
never
enter
it
at
all
,
although
she
must
have
know
that
he
be
there
 
<EOS>
these
be
his
alternation
from
happiness
to
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
from
her
parent
he
always
have
a
welcome
.
<EOS>
oppress
by
their
daughter
's
depression
of
spirit
,
they
hail
the
coming
of
any
visitor
as
a
change
for
her
as
well
as
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
former
intimacy
with
the
Corneys
be
in
abeyance
for
all
party
,
owe
to
Bessy
Corney
's
out
-
speak
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
cousin
,
as
if
she
have
have
reason
to
look
upon
him
as
her
lover
,
whereas
Sylvia
's
parent
feel
this
as
a
slur
upon
their
daughter
's
cause
of
grief
.
<EOS>
but
although
at
this
time
the
member
of
the
two
family
cease
to
seek
after
each
other
's
society
,
nothing
be
say
.
<EOS>
the
thread
of
friendship
may
be
join
afresh
at
any
time
,
only
just
now
it
be
break
;
and
Philip
be
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
before
go
to
Haytersbank
he
seek
each
time
for
some
little
present
with
which
to
make
his
come
welcome
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
wish
even
more
than
ever
that
Sylvia
have
care
for
learning
;
if
she
have
he
could
have
take
her
many
a
pretty
ballad
,
or
story
-
book
,
<EOS>
such
as
be
then
in
vogue
.
<EOS>
He
do
try
her
with
the
translation
of
the
_
Sorrows
of
Werther
_
,
so
popular
at
the
time
that
it
have
a
place
in
all
pedlar

basket
,
with
Law

<EOS>

<EOS>
but
she
could
not
read
it
for
herself
;
and
after
turn
the
leave
languidly
over
,
and
smile
a
little
at
the
picture
of
Charlotte
cut
bread
and
butter
in
a
left
-
handed
manner
,
she
put
it
aside
on
the
shelf
by
the
_
Complete
Farrier
_
;
and
there
Philip
see
it
,
upside
down
and
untouched
,
the
next
time
he
come
to
the
farm
.
  
<EOS>
many
a
time
during
that
summer
do
he
turn
to
the
few
verse
in
Genesis
in
which
Jacob
's
twice
seven
year
'
service
for
Rachel
be
relate
,
and
try
and
take
fresh
heart
from
the
reward
which
come
to
the
patriarch
's
constancy
at
last
.
<EOS>
after
try
book
,
nosegay
,
small
present
of
pretty
article
of
dress
,
such
as
suit
the
notion
of
those
day
,
and
find
them
all
receive
with
the
same
languid
gratitude
,
he
set
himself
to
endeavour
to
please
her
in
some
other
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
that
he
should
change
his
tactic
;
for
the
girl
be
become
weary
of
the
necessity
for
thank
him
,
every
time
he
come
,
for
some
little
favour
or
other
.
<EOS>
She
wish
he
would
let
her
alone
and
not
watch
her
continually
with
such
sad
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
father
and
mother
hail
her
first
sign
of
impatient
petulance
towards
him
as
a
return
to
the
old
state
of
thing
before
Kinraid
have
come
to
disturb
the
tenour
of
their
life
;
for
even
Daniel
have
turn
against
the
specksioneer
,
irritate
by
the
Corneys
'
loud
moan
over
the
loss
of
the
man
to
whom
their
daughter
say
that
she
be
attach
.
<EOS>
if
Daniel
wish
for
him
to
be
alive
again
,
it
be
mainly
that
the
Corneys
may
be
convince
that
his
last
visit
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Monkshaven
be
for
the
sake
of
the
pale
and
silent
Sylvia
,
and
not
for
that
of
Bessy
,
who
complain
of
Kinraid
's
untimely
death
rather
as
if
by
it
she
have
be
cheat
of
a
husband
than
for
any
overwhelming
personal
love
towards
the
deceased
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
after
her
he
be
a
big
black
scoundrel
,
that
be
what
he
be
;
and
a
wish
he
be
alive
again
to
be
hang
.
<EOS>
but
a
dunnot
believe
it
;
them
Corney
lass
be
allay
a

talkin
'
an
'
a
-
thinking
on
sweetheart
,
and
niver
a
man
cross
t

threshold
<EOS>
but
they
try
him
on
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
an
'
their
mother
be
no
better
:
Kinraid
have
speak
civil
to
Bessy
as
become
a
lad
to
a
lass
,
and
she
make
an
ado
over
him
as
if
they
would
be
to
church
together
not
a
week
sin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dunnot
uphold
t

corney
;
but
Molly
Corney
 
<EOS>
as
be
Molly
Brunton
now
 
use
to
speak
on
this
dead
man
to
our
Sylvie
as
if
he
be
her
sweetheart
in
old
day
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
no
smoke
without
fire
,
and
I
be
think
it
be
likely
enough
he
be
<EOS>
one
of
them
fellow
as
be
always
after
some
lass
or
another
,
and
,
as
often
as
not

two

three
at
a

<EOS>
now
look
at
Philip
,
what
a
different
one
he
be
!
<EOS>
He
be
niver
<EOS>
think
on
a

our
Sylvie
,
I
will
be

so
old

hearted

too

<EOS>
n
<EOS>
or
he
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
a
way
o
'
preach
wi
'
him
as
a
could
not
abide
;
but
now
he
tak
's
his
glass
,
an
'
hold
his
tongue
<EOS>
,
leavin
'
room
for
wise
man
to
say
their
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
a
conjugal
colloquy
about
this
time
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
gain
ground
with
Daniel
,
and
that
be
something
towards
win
Sylvia
's
heart
;
for
she
be
unaware
of
her
father
's
change
of
feeling
towards
Kinraid
,
and
take
all
his
tenderness
towards
herself
as
if
they
be
mark
of
his
regard
for
her
lost
lover
and
his
sympathy
in
her
loss
,
instead
of
which
he
be
rather
feel
as
if
it
may
be
a
good
thing
after
all
that
the
fickle
-
hearted
sailor
be
dead
and
drown
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Daniel
be
very
like
a
child
in
all
the
part
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
be
strongly
affect
by
whatever
be
present
,
and
apt
to
forget
the
absent
.
<EOS>
He
act
on
impulse
,
and
too
often
have
reason
to
be
sorry
for
it
;
but
he
hate
his
sorrow
too
much
to
let
it
teach
him
wisdom
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
with
all
his
many
fault
,
however
,
he
have
something
in
him
which
make
him
be
dearly
love
,
both
by
the
daughter
whom
he
indulge
,
and
the
wife
who
be
in
fact
superior
to
him
,
but
whom
he
imagine
that
he
rule
with
a
wise
and
absolute
sway
.
  
<EOS>
love
to
Sylvia
give
Philip
tact
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
find
out
that
to
please
the
woman
of
the
household
he
must
pay
all
possible
attention
to
the
man
;
and
though
he
care
little
in
comparison
for
Daniel
,
yet
this
autumn
he
be
continually
think
of
how
he
could
please
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
say
or
do
anything
to
gratify
or
amuse
her
father
,
Sylvia
smile
and
be
kind
.
<EOS>
whatever
he
do
be
right
with
his
aunt
;
but
even
she
be
unusually
glad
when
her
husband
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
still
his
progress
be
slow
towards
his
object
;
and
often
he
sigh
himself
to
sleep
with
the
word
,
"
seven
year
,
and
maybe
seven
year
more
"
.
<EOS>
then
in
his
dream
he
see
Kinraid
again
,
sometimes
struggle
,
sometimes
sail
towards
land
,
<EOS>
the
only
one
on
board
a
swift
advance
ship
,
alone
on
deck
,
stern
and
avenge
;
till
Philip
awake
in
remorseful
terror
.
  
<EOS>
such
and
similar
dream
return
with
the
great
frequency
when
,
in
the
November
of
that
year
,
the
coast
between
Hartlepool
and
Monkshaven
be
overshadow
by
the
presence
of
guard
-
ship
,
drive
south
from
their
station
at
North
Shields
by
the
resolution
which
the
sailor
of
that
port
have
enter
into
to
resist
the
press
-
gang
,
and
the
energy
with
which
they
have
begin
to
carry
out
their
determination
.
<EOS>
for
on
a
certain
Tuesday
evening
yet
remember
by
old
inhabitant
of
North
Shields
,
the
sailor
in
the
merchant
service
meet
together
and
overpower
the
press
-
gang
,
dismiss
them
from
the
town
with
the
high
contempt
,
and
with
their
jacket
reverse
.
<EOS>
a
numerous
mob
go
with
them
to
Chirton
Bar
;
give
them
three
cheer
at
parting
,
but
vow
to
tear
them
limb
from
limb
<EOS>
should
they
seek
to
re
-
enter
North
Shields
.
<EOS>
but
a
few
day
afterwards
some
fresh
cause
of
irritation
arise
,
and
five
hundred
sailor
,
arm
with
such
sword
and
pistol
as
they
could
collect
,
parade
through
the
town
in

this

<EOS>
next

they

not
before
the

receive
a
great
fright
,
the
drum
of
the
North

beat
to

and
the
terrified

rush
out
into

the

and
some
of

the

but
a

week
after

the
impressment
service
take
their
revenge
for
the
insult
they
have
be

<EOS>
in

a

with
that
prize
they
set

,
and
wisely
leave
the

,
where
deep
passionate
vengeance

<EOS>
not

the
dread
of
an
invasion
by
the
French
could
reconcile
the
people
of
these
coast
to
the
necessity
of

<EOS>
fear
and
confusion
prevail
after
this
to
within

<EOS>
a

that

because
a

itself
so

and
they
only
return
to

on
the
assurance
from

even
then

<EOS>
no

the
period
of

full
of
gloomy

instead
of
its
be
the
annual

of

;
of
gladdened

,
where
brave

of

boisterous
joviality
among
those
who

that

unbounded

on

by

<EOS>
in

this

humble

for

to

full
of
blue

<EOS>
in

the

cluster

fearful
of

as

<EOS>
Most

keep
their

<EOS>
the

the

<EOS>
indeed
,
all

it

the

fatal

lie
motionless
at

three
mile
off

<EOS>
when
first
Philip
have
hear
in
his
shop
that
these
three
man
-
of
-
war
may
be
see
lie
fall
and
still
on
the
gray
horizon
,
his
heart
sink
,
and
he
scarcely
dare
to
ask
their
name
.
<EOS>
for
if
one
should
be
the
_
Alcestis
_
;
if
Kinraid
should
send
word
to
Sylvia
;
if
he
should
say
he
be
live
,
and
loving
,
and
faithful
;
if
it
should
come
to
pass
that
the
fact
of
the
undelivered
message
send
by
her
lover
through
Philip
should
reach
Sylvia
's
ear
:
what
would
be
the
position
of
the
latter
,
not
merely
in
her
love
 
<EOS>
that
,
of
course
,
would
be
hopeless
 
but
in
her
esteem
?
<EOS>
all
sophistry
vanish
;
the
fear
of
detection
awaken
Philip
to
a
sense
of
guilt
;
and
,
besides
,
he
find
out
,
that
,
in
spite
of
all
idle
talk
and
careless
slander
,
he
could
not
help
believe
that
Kinraid
be
in
terrible
earnest
when
he
utter
those
passionate
word
,
and
entreat
that
they
may
be
bear
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
some
instinct
tell
Philip
that
if
the
specksioneer
have
only
flirt
with
too
many
,
yet
that
for
Sylvia
Robson
his
love
be
true
and
vehement
.
<EOS>
then
Philip
try
to
convince
himself
that
,
from
all
that
be
say
of
his
previous
character
,
Kinraid
be
not
capable
of
an
endure
constant
attachment
;
and
with
such
poor
opiate
to
his
conscience
as
he
could
obtain
from
this
notion
Philip
be
oblige
to
remain
content
,
until
,
a
day
or
two
after
the
first
intelligence
of
the
presence
of
those
three
ship
,
he
learn
,
with
some
trouble
and
pain
,
that
their
name
be
the
_
Megoera
_
,
the
_
Bellerophon
_
,
and
the
_
Hanover
_
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
perceive
how
unlikely
it
be
that
the
_
Alcestis
_
should
have
be
linger
on
this
shore
all
these
many
month
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
doubtless
,
go
far
away
by
this
time
<EOS>
;
she
have
,
probably
,
join
the
fleet
on
the
war
station
.
<EOS>
who
could
tell
what
have
become
of
her
and
her
crew
?
<EOS>
she
may
have
be
in
battle
before
now
,
and
if
so
      
<EOS>
so
his
previous
fancy
shrink
to
nothing
,
rebuke
for
their
improbability
,
and
with
them
vanish
his
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
yet
there
be
time
when
the
popular
attention
seem
totally
absorb
by
the
dread
of
the
press
-
gang
;
when
no
other
subject
be
talk
about
 
hardly
,
in
fact
,
think
about
.
<EOS>
at
such
flow
of
panic
,
Philip
have
his
own
private
fear
lest
a
flash
of
light
should
come
upon
Sylvia
,
and
she
should
suddenly
see
that
Kinraid
's
absence
may
be
account
for
in
another
way
besides
death
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
reason
,
this
seem
unlikely
.
<EOS>
no
man
-
of
-
war
have
be
see
off
the
coast
,
or
,
if
see
,
have
never
be
speak
about
,
at
the
time
of
Kinraid
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
vanish
this
winter
time
,
every
one
would
have
be
convince
that
the
press
-
gang
have
seize
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
never
hear
any
one
breathe
the
dreaded
name
of
the
_
Alcestis
_
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
go
on
to
think
,
at
the
farm
they
be
out
of
hearing
of
this
one
great
weary
subject
of
talk
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
,
as
he
become
convince
one
evening
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
catch
him
a
little
aside
while
Sylvia
be
in
the
dairy
,
and
her
husband
talk
in
the
shippen
with
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
for

Philip
,
dunnot

<EOS>
It

that
thou'd

<EOS>
He
really
tremble
wi

rage
and

an

it
be
just

<EOS>
He
start
up

<EOS>
Philip
speak

by
no

but
as
if
compel
to
speak

<EOS>
"
an

"
  
<EOS>
the
instant
these
word
have
come
out
of
his
lip
he
could
have
bite
his
tongue
off
.
<EOS>
and
yet
afterwards
it
be
a
sort
of
balm
to
his
conscience
that
he
have
so
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
nonsense

say
his

he

they
have

do
aught

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
Sylvie
say
?
"
ask
Philip
,
in
a
hoarse
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
?
<EOS>
why
,
a
'
she
could
say
be
to
burst
out
cry
,
and
after
a
bit
,
she
just
repeat
her

word

and
say
anyhow
he

dead

for
he
would
niver
live

<EOS>
She
know
him
too
well

<EOS>
Thou
see
she
think
a

on

for
a
spirited

as
can
do
what
he
will

<EOS>
I
belie

<EOS>
me
<EOS>
she
first
begin

time
o

when

could
not
conquer

<EOS>
She
be
sooner
think
on

as
she
be
ne'er
to

him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
good
so
,
"
say
Philip
,
and
then
,
to
calm
his
unusually
excited
aunt
,
he
promise
to
avoid
the
subject
of
the
press
-
gang
as
much
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
promise
very
difficult
of
performance
,
for
Daniel
Robson
be
,
as
his
wife
say
,
like
one
possessed
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
think
of
anything
else
,
though
he
himself
be
occasionally
weary
of
the
same
constantly
recur
idea
,
and
would
fain
have
banish
it
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
old
a
man
to
be
likely
to
be
take
by
them
;
he
have
no
son
to
become
their
victim
;
but
the
terror
of
them
,
which
he
have
brave
and
defy
in
his
youth
,
seem
to
come
back
and
take
possession
of
him
in
his
age
;
and
with
the
terror
come
impatient
hatred
.
<EOS>
since
his
wife
's
illness
the
previous
winter
he
have
be
a
more
sober
man
until
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
exactly
drunk
,
for
he
have
a
strong
,
well
-
season
head
;
but
the
craving
to
hear
the
last
news
of
the
action
of
the
press
-
gang
draw
him
into
Monkshaven
nearly
every
day
at
this
dead
agricultural
season
of
the
year
;
and
a
public
-
house
be
generally
the
focus
from
which
gossip
radiate
;
and
probably
the
amount
of
drink
thus
consume
weaken
Robson
's
power
over
his
mind
,
and
cause
the
concentration
of
thought
on
one
subject
.
<EOS>
this
may
be
a
physiological
explanation
of
what
afterwards
be
speak
of
as
a
supernatural
kind
of
possession
,
lead
him
to
his
doom
.
    
<EOS>
RETALIATION
  
<EOS>
the
public
-
house
that
have
be
choose
by
the
leader
of
the
press
-
gang
in
Monkshaven
at
this
time
,
for
their
rendezvous
(
or
"
Randyvowse
"
,
as
it
be
generally
pronounce
)
,
be
an
inn
of
poor
repute
,
with
a
yard
at
the
back
which
open
on
to
the
staithe
or
quay
near
to
the
open
sea
.
<EOS>
a
strong
high
stone
wall
bound
this
grass

grow
mouldy
yard
on
two
side
;
the
house
,
and
some
unused
out

building
,
form
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
the
choice
of
the
place
be
good
enough
,
both
as
to
situation
,
which
be
sufficiently
isolate
,
and
yet
near
to
the
widen
river
;
and
as
to
the
character
of
the
landlord
,
John
Hobbs
be
a
fail
man
,
one
who
seem
as
if
doom
to
be
unfortunate
in
all
his
undertaking
,
and
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
all
this
be
that
he
be
envious
of
the
more
prosperous
,
and
willing
to
do
anything
that
may
bring
him
in
a
little
present
success
in
life
.
<EOS>
His
household
consist
of
his
wife
,
her
niece
,
who
act
as
servant
,
and
an
out
-
of
-
door
man
,
a
brother
of
Ned
Simpson
,
the
well
-
do
butcher
,
who
at
one
time
have
have
a
fancy
for
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
but
the
one
brother
be
prosperous
,
the
other
have
go
on
sink
in
life
,
like
him
who
be
now
his
master
.
<EOS>
neither
Hobbs
nor
his
man
Simpson
be
absolutely
bad
man
;
if
thing
have
go
well
with
them
they
may
each
have
be
as
scrupulous
and
conscientious
as
their
neighbour
,
and
even
now
,
suppose
the
gain
in
money
to
be
equal
,
they
would
sooner
have
do
good
than
evil
;
but
a
very
small
sum
be
enough
to
turn
the
balance
.
<EOS>
and
in
a
great
degree
than
in
most
case
be
the
famous
maxim
of
Rochefoucault
true
with
them
;
for
in
the
misfortune
of
their
friend
they
seem
to
see
some
justification
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
blind
fate
deal
out
event
,
not
that
the
event
themselves
be
the
inevitable
consequence
of
folly
or
misconduct
.
<EOS>
to
such
man
as
these
the
large
sum
offer
by
the
lieutenant
of
the
press
-
gang
for
the
accommodation
of
the
Mariners
'
arm
be
simply
and
immediately
irresistible
.
<EOS>
the
good
room
in
the
dilapidated
house
be
put
at
the
service
of
the
command
officer
of
the
impress
service
,
and
all
other
arrangement
make
at
his
desire
,
irrespective
of
all
the
former
unprofitable
source
of
custom
and
of
business
.
<EOS>
if
the
relative
both
of
Hobbs
and
of
Simpson
have
not
be
so
well
known
and
so
prosperous
in
the
town
,
they
themselves
would
have
receive
more
mark
of
popular
ill
opinion
than
they
do
during
the
winter
the
event
of
which
be
now
be
record
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
people
speak
to
them
when
they
appear
at
kirk
or
at
market
,
but
hold
no
conversation
with
them
;
no
,
not
although
they
each
appear
better
dressed
than
they
have
either
of
them
do
for
year
past
,
and
although
their
whole
manner
show
a
change
,
inasmuch
as
they
have
be
formerly
snarl
and
misanthropic
,
and
be
now
civil
almost
to
deprecation
.
  
<EOS>
every
one
who
be
capable
of
understand
the
state
of
feeling
in
Monkshaven
at
this
time
must
have
be
aware
that
at
any
moment
an
explosion
may
take
place
;
and
probably
there
be
those
who
have
judgment
enough
to
be
surprised
that
it
do
not
take
place
sooner
than
it
do
.
<EOS>
for
until
February
there
be
only
occasional
cry
and
growl
of
rage
,
as
the
press
-
gang
make
their
capture
first
here
,
then
there
;
often
,
apparently
,
tranquil
for
day
,
then
hear
of
at
some
distance
along
the
coast
,
then
carry
off
a
seaman
from
the
very
heart
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
seem
afraid
of
provoke
any
general
hostility
,
such
as
that
which
have
drive
them
from
Shields
,
and
would
have
conciliate
the
inhabitant
if
they
could
;
the
officer
on
the
service
and
on
board
the
three
man
-
of
-
war
come
often
into
the
town
,
spend
largely
,
talk
to
all
with
cheery
friendliness
,
and
make
themselves
very
popular
in
such
society
as
they
could
obtain
access
to
at
the
house
of
the
neighbouring
magistrate
or
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
however
agreeable
,
do
not
forward
the
object
the
impress
service
have
in
view
;
and
,
accordingly
,
a
more
decide
step
be
take
at
a
time
when
,
although
there
be
no
apparent
evidence
as
to
the
fact
,
the
town
be
full
of
the
Greenland
mariner
come
quietly
in
to
renew
their
yearly
engagement
,
which
,
when
do
,
would
legally
entitle
them
to
protection
from
impressment
.
<EOS>
one
night
 
it
be
on
a
Saturday
,
February
23rd
,
when
there
be
a
bitter
black
frost
,
with
a
north
-
east
wind
sweep
through
the
street
,
and
man
and
woman
be
close
shut
in
their
house
 
<EOS>
all
be
startle
in
their
household
content
and
warmth
by
the
sound
of
the
fire
-
bell
busily
swinge
,
and
peal
out
for
help
.
<EOS>
the
fire
-
bell
be
keep
in
the
market
-
house
where
High
Street
and
Bridge
Street
meet
:
every
one
know
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
some
dwelling
,
or
maybe
a
boiling
-
house
be
on
fire
,
and
neighbourly
assistance
be
summon
with
all
speed
,
in
a
town
where
no
water
be
lay
on
,
nor
fire

engine
keep
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
man
snatch
up
their
hat
,
and
rush
out
,
wife
follow
,
some
with
the
readiest
wrap
they
could
lay
hand
on
,
with
which
to
clothe
the
over
-
hasty
husband
,
other
from
that
mixture
of
dread
and
curiosity
which
draw
people
to
the
scene
of
any
disaster
.
<EOS>
those
of
the
market
people
who
be
make
the
good
of
their
way
homeward
,
have
wait
in
the
town
till
the
early
darkness
conceal
their
path
,
turn
back
at
the
sound
of
the
ever
-
clang
fire
-
bell
,
ring
out
faster
and
faster
as
if
the
danger
become
every
instant
more
pressing
.
  
<EOS>
as
man
run
against
or
alongside
of
each
other
,
their
breathless
question
be
ever
,
"
where
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
and
no
one
could
tell
;
so
they
press
onwards
into
the
market
-
place
,
sure
of
obtain
the
information
desire
there
,
where
the
fire
-
bell
keep
call
out
with
its
furious
metal
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
the
dull
oil
-
lamp
in
the
adjoin
street
only
make
darkness
visible
in
the
thronged
market
-
place
,
where
the
buzz
of
many
man
's
unanswered
question
be
rise
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
a
strange
feeling
of
dread
creep
over
those
near
to
the
closed
market
-
house
.
<EOS>
above
them
in
the
air
the
bell
be
still
clang
;
but
before
them
be
a
door
fast
shut
and
lock
;
no
one
to
speak
and
tell
them
why
they
be
summon
 
where
they
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
the
heart
of
the
mystery
,
and
it
be
a
silent
blank
!
<EOS>
Their
unformed
dread
take
shape
at
the
cry
from
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
from
where
man
be
still
come
down
the
eastern
side
of
Bridge
Street
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the

upon

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
then
the
fire
-
bell
have
be
a
decoy
;
a
sort
of
seethe
the
kid
in
its
mother
's
milk
,
lead
man
into
a
snare
through
their
kindly
feeling
.
<EOS>
some
dull
sense
of
this
add
to
utter
dismay
,
and
make
them
struggle
and
strain
to
get
to
all
the
outlet
save
that
in
which
a
fight
be
now
go
on
;
the
swish
of
heavy
whip
,
the
thud
of
bludgeon
,
the
groans
,
the
growl
of
wound
or
infuriate
man
,
come
with
terrible
distinctness
through
the
darkness
to
the
quicken
ear
of
fear
.
  
<EOS>
a
breathless
group
rush
up
the
blackness
of
a
narrow
entry
to
stand
still
awhile
,
and
recover
strength
for
fresh
running
.
<EOS>
for
a
time
nothing
but
heavy
pant
and
gasp
be
hear
amongst
them

<EOS>
no

know
his

their
good

so
lately
abused

make

before

have
finish
speak

those
near

mutter
their
assent
to
his
project
,
and
have
steal
off
,
keep
to
the
dark
side
of
the
street
and
lane
,
which
they
thread
in
different
direction
;
most
of

go
straight
as
sleuth

hound
to
the

more
ferocious

<EOS>
to
him
it
be
an
adventure
like
many
he

indeed

the
liquor
he
have
drunk
have
give
him
a
fictitious
youth
for
the
time

and
it
be
more
in
the
light
of
a
rough
frolic
of
which
he
be
to
be
the
leader
,
that
he
limp
along
(
always
lame
from
old
attack
of
rheumatism

,
chuckle
to
himself
at
the
apparent
stillness
of
the
town

which
give
no
warning
to
the
press

gang
at
the
rendezvous

anything
in

<EOS>
Daniel
,
too
,
have
his
friend
to

old

It
be
nine
o'clock

by
nine
o'clock

Monkshaven
,
in

<EOS>
but
more
than
half
way
up
to
the
top

man
cluster
like
bee
;
all
press
so
as
to
be
near
enough
to
question
those
who
stand
near
to
the
planning
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
a
woman
,
with
wild
gesture
and
shrill
voice
,
that
no
entreaty
would
hush
down
to
the
whispered
pitch
of
the
man
,
push
her
way
through
the
crowd
 
this
one
implore
immediate
action

that
adjure
those
around
her
to
smite

those

<EOS>
low
down
in

silent

night

Daniel
soon
find
himself
a
laggard
in

compare
to
some
of

around
him

but
when

with
the
rush

few

they
have
arrive
at
the
blank

dark

shut

in

take
the

not

his

have
be

<EOS>
the
crowd
behind
him
begin
to
jeer
and
to
threaten

Daniel

who
have
make
way
for
young
and
more
powerful
man
to
conduct
the
assault

and
have
employ
his
time
meanwhile
in

the

.
<EOS>
the
man
rush
after
him
,
almost
knock
him
down
,
as
he
make
his
way
into
the
lane
into
which
the
door
of
the
outbuilding
belong
to
the
inn
open
.
<EOS>
Daniel
have
already
break
the
fastening
of
that
which
open
into
a
damp
,
mouldy
-
smell
shippen
,
in
one
corner
of
which
a
poor
lean
cow
shift
herself
on
her
leg
,
in
an
uneasy
,
restless
manner
,
as
her
sleeping
-
place
be
invade
by
as
many
man
as
could
cram
themselves
into
the
dark
hold
.
<EOS>
Daniel
,
at
the
end
farth
from
the
door
,
be
almost
smother
before
he
could
break
down
the
rotten
wooden
shutter
,
that
,
when
open
,
display
the
weedy
yard
of
the
old
inn
,
the
full
clear
light
define
the
outline
of
each
blade
of
grass
by
the
delicate
black
shadow
behind
.
  
<EOS>
this
hole
,
use
to
give
air
and
light
to
what
have
once
be
a
stable
,
in
the
day
when
horse
traveller
be
in
the
habit
of
come
to
the
Mariners
'
arm
,
be
large
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
a
man
;
and
Daniel
,
in
virtue
of
its
discovery
,
be
the
first
to
get
through
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
large
and
heavy
than
he
have
be
;
his
lameness
make
him
less
agile
,
and
the
impatient
crowd
behind
him
give
him
a
help
push
that
send
him
down
on
the
round
stone
with
which
the
yard
be
pave
,
and
for
the
time
disable
him
so
much
that
he
could
only
just
crawl
out
of
the
way
of
leap
foot
and
heavy
nail
boot
,
which
come
through
the
opening
till
the
yard
be
fill
with
man
,
who
now
set
up
a
fierce
,
derisive
shout
,
which
,
to
their
delight
,
be
answer
from
within
.
<EOS>
no
more
silence
,
no
more
dead
opposition
:
a
live
struggle
,
a
glowing
,
rage
fight
;
and
Daniel
think
he
should
be
oblige
to
sit
there
still
,
lean
against
the
wall
,
inactive
,
while
the
strife
and
the
action
be
go
on
in
which
he
have
once
be
foremost
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
the
stone
tear
up
;
he
see
them
use
with
good
effect
on
the
unguarded
back
-
door
;
he
cry
out
in
useless
warning
as
he
see
the
upper
window
open
,
and
aim
take
among
the
crowd
;
but
just
then
the
door
give
way
,
and
there
be
an
involuntary
forward
motion
in
the
throng
,
so
that
no
one
be
so
disabled
by
the
shot
as
to
prevent
his
force
his
way
in
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
sound
come
veil
by
the
wall
as
of
some
rage
ravening
beast
growl
over
his
prey
;
the
noise
come
and
go
 
once
utterly
cease
;
and
Daniel
raise
himself
with
difficulty
to
ascertain
the
cause
,
when
again
the
roar
come
clear
and
fresh
,
and
man
pour
into
the
yard
again
,
shout
and
rejoice
over
the
rescue
victim
of
the
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
Daniel
hobble
up
,
and
shout
,
and
rejoice
,
and
shake
hand
with
the
rest
,
hardly
care
to
understand
that
the
lieutenant
and
his
gang
have
quit
the
house
by
a
front
window
,
and
that
all
have
pour
out
in
search
of
them
;
the
great
part
,
however
,
return
to
liberate
the
prisoner
,
and
then
glut
their
vengeance
on
the
house
and
its
content
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
the
window
,
upper
and
low
,
furniture
be
now
be
throw
into

<EOS>
the
smash
of
glass
,
the
heavy
crash
of
wood
,
the
cry
,
the
laughter
,
the
oath
,
all
excited
Daniel
to
the
utmost
;
<EOS>
and
,
forget
his
bruise
,
he
press
forwards
to
lend
a
help
hand
.
<EOS>
the
wild
,
rough
success
of
his
scheme
almost
turn
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
hurrae
at
every
flagrant
piece
of
destruction
;
he
shake
hand
with
every
one
around
him
,
and
,
at
last
,
<EOS>
when
the
destroyer
inside
pause
to
take
breath
,
he
cry
out
,
    
"

<EOS>
no
sooner
say
than
do
.
<EOS>
Their
excitement
be
ready
to
take
the
slight
hint
of
mischief
;
old
chair
,
break
table
,
odd
drawer
,
smash
chest
,
be
rapidly
and
skilfully
heap
into
a
pyramid
,
and
one
,
who
at
the
first
broaching
of
the
idea
have
go
for
live
coal
the
speedy
to
light
up
the
fire
,
come
now
through
the
crowd
with
a
large
shovelful
of
red
-
hot
cinder
.
<EOS>
the
rioter
stop
to
take
breath
and
look
on
like
child
at
the
uncertain
flickering
blaze
,
which
spring
high
one
moment
,
and
drop
down
the
next
only
to
creep
along
the
base
of
the
heap
of
wreck
,
and
make
secure
of
its
future
work
.
<EOS>
then
the
lurid
blaze
dart
up
wild
,
high
,
and
irrepressible
;
and
the
man
around
give
a
cry
of
fierce
exultation
,
and
in
rough
mirth
begin
to
try
and
push
each
other
in
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
pause
of
the
rushing
,
roar
noise
of
the
flame
,
the
moan
low
and
groan
of
the
poor
alarmed
cow
fasten
up
in
the
shippen
catch
Daniel
's
ear
,
and
he
understand
her
groan
as
well
as
if
they
have
be
word
.
<EOS>
He
limp
out
of
the
yard
through
the
now
desert
house
,
where
man
be
busy
at
the
mad
work
of
destruction
,
and
find
his
way
back
to
the
lane
into
which
the
shippen
open
.
<EOS>
the
cow
be
dance
about
at
the
roar
,
and
dazzle
,
and
heat
of
the
fire
;
but
Daniel
know
how
to
soothe
her
,
and
in
a
few
minute
he
have
a
rope
round
her
neck
,
and
lead
her
gently
out
from
the
scene
of
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
in
the
lane
when
Simpson
,
the
man

of

all

at
the
Mariners

creep
out
of
some
hiding

in
the

and
stand
suddenly
face

with
Robson

<EOS>

white
with
fear

he
be
no
bad
than
most
of
his
neighbour
,
indeed
well
than
several

who
go
off
once
or
twice
a
year
,
or
even
oftener
,
on
drink
bout
of
two
or

and
,
after
the
conjugal
reception
be
well
over
,
settle
down
into
hard

work
and
decently
sober
man
until
the
temptation
again
get
power
over
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
market
day
,
every
man
drink
more
than
usual
;
every
bargain
or
agreement
be
ratify
by
drink
;
they
come
from
great
or
less
distance
,
either
afoot
or
on
horseback
,
and
the
"
good
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
"
(
as
the
old
inn
-
sign
express
it
)
<EOS>
always
include
a
considerable
amount
of
liquor
to
be
drunk
by
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
's
way
of
announce
his
intention
of
drink
more
than
ordinary
be
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
would
say
at
the
last
moment
,
"
Missus
,
I
have
a
mind
to
get
fuddle
to
-
neet
,
"
and
be
off
,
disregard
her
look
of
remonstrance
,
and
little
heed
the
injunction
she
would
call
after
him
to
beware
of
such
and
such
companion
,
or
to
attend
to
his
footstep
on
his
road
home
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
night
he
have
give
no
such
warning
.
<EOS>
Bell
and
Sylvia
put
the
candle
on
the
low
window
-
seat
at
the
usual
hour
to
guide
him
through
the
field
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
habit
keep
up
even
on
moonlight
night
like
this
 
and
sate
on
each
side
of
the
fire
,
at
first
scarcely
care
to
listen
,
<EOS>
so
secure
be
they
of
his
return
.
<EOS>
Bell
doze
,
and
Sylvia
sate
gaze
at
the
fire
with
abstract
eye
,
think
of
the
past
year
and
of
the
anniversary
which
be
approach
of
the
day
when
she
have
last
see
the
lover
whom
she
believe
to
be
dead
,
lie
somewhere
fathom
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
that
sunny
sea
on
which
she
look
day
by
day
without
ever
see
his
upturned
face
through
the
depth
,
with
whatsoever
heart
-
sick
longing
for
just
one
more
sight
she
yearn
and
inwardly
cry
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
set
her
eye
on
his
bright
,
handsome
face
,
that
face
which
be
fade
from
her
memory
,
overtaske
in
the
too
frequent
effort
to
recall
it
;
if
she
could
but
see
him
once
again
,
come
over
the
water
beneath
which
he
lie
with
supernatural
motion
,
await
her
at
the
stile
,
with
the
evening
sun
shine
ruddy
into
his
bonny
eye
,
even
though
,
after
that
one
instant
of
vivid
and
visible
life
,
he
fade
into
mist
;
if
she
could
but
see
him
now
,
sit
in
the
faintly
flickering
fire
-
light
in
the
old
,
happy
,
careless
way
,
on
a
corner
of
the
dresser
,
his
leg
dangle
,
his
busy
finger
play
with
some
of
her
woman
's
work
;
 
<EOS>
she
wring
her
hand
tight
together
as
she
implore
some
,
any
Power
,
to
let
her
see
him
just
once
again
 
just
once
 
for
one
minute
of
passionate
delight
.
<EOS>
never
again
would
she
forget
that
dear
face
,
if
but
once
more
she
may
set
her
eye
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
head
fall
with
a
sudden
jerk
,
and
she
rouse
herself
up
;
and
Sylvia
put
by
her
thought
of
the
dead
,
and
her
craving
after
his
presence
,
into
that
receptacle
of
her
heart
where
all
such
be
keep
closed
and
sacred
from
the
light
of
common
day
.
  
<EOS>
"

It

but
she
have
not

the

<EOS>
there
be
another
long
silence
;
both
wide
awake
this
time

<EOS>
"

for

<EOS>
but
once
place
in
a
little
basin
in
the
oven

there
be
again
time
for

"

Sylvia
shiver
all
over
at
the
sudden
thought
,
suggest
by
this
speech
of
her
mother
's
,
that
the
idea
that
have
flash
into
her
own
mind
of
go
to
look
for
her
father
may
be
an
answer
to
the
invocation
to
the
Powers
which
she
have
make
not
long
ago
,
that
she
may
indeed
meet
her
dead
lover
at
the
ash
-
field
stile
;
but
though
she
shiver
as
this
superstitious
fancy
come
into
her
head
,
her
heart
beat
firm
and
regular
;
not
from
darkness
nor
from
the
spirit
of
the
dead
be
she
go
to
shrink
;
her
great
sorrow
have
take
away
all
her
girlish
nervous
fear
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
;
and
she
come
back
.
<EOS>
neither
man
nor
spirit
have
she
see
;
the
wind
be
blow
on
the
height
enough
to
sweep
all
creature
before
it
;
but
no
one
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
sate
down
again
to
keep
watch
.
<EOS>
at
length
his
step
be
hear
close
to
the
door
;
and
it
startle
them
even
in
their
state
of
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
cry
Sylvia
as
he
enter
;
while
his

stand
up

,
but
not

a

<EOS>
"
A'm

<EOS>
and
so
he
go
on
to
tell
of
the
ruse
by
which
they
have
be
entice
into
the
market
-
place
;
interrupt
from
time
to
time
by
their
eager
question
,
and
interrupt
himself
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
with
exclamation
of
weariness
and
pain
,
which
make
him
at
last
say
,
    
"
now

"
  
<EOS>
He
go
wearily
upstairs
,
and
wife
and
daughter
both
strove
their
good
to
ease
his
aching
limb
,
and
make
him
comfortable
.
<EOS>
the
warming

,
only

be
take
down
and
unpapere
for
his
service
;
and
as
he
get
between
the
warm
sheet
,
he
thank
Sylvia
and
her
mother
in
a
sleepy
voice
,
add
,
    
"
It

and
then
slumber
fall
upon
him
,
and
he
be
hardly
rouse
by
Bell
's
softly
kiss
his
weather
-
beat
cheek
,
and
say
low
,
    
"
God

my

<EOS>
Thou

allay
for

"
  
<EOS>
He
murmur
some
monosyllabic
reply
,
unheard
by
his
wife
,
who
steal
away
to
undress
herself
noiselessly
,
and
lay
herself
down
on
her
side
of
the
bed
as
gently
as
her
stiffened
limb
would
permit
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
late
in
rise
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Kester
be
long
since
up
and
at
his
work
among
the
cattle
before
he
see
the
house
-
door
open
to
admit
the
fresh
chill
morning
air
;
and
even
then
Sylvia
brush
softly
,
and
go
about
almost
on
tip
-
toe
.
<EOS>
when
the
porridge
be
ready
,
Kester
be
call
in
to
his
breakfast
,
which
he
take
sit
at
the
dresser
with
the
family
.
<EOS>
a
large
wooden
platter
stand
in
the
middle
;
and
each
have
a
bowl
of
the
same
material
fill
with
milk
.
<EOS>
the
way
be
for
every
one
to
dip
his
pewter
spoon
into
the
central
dish
,
and
convey
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
like
at
a
time
of
the
hot
porridge
into
his
pure
fresh
milk
.
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
Bell
tell
Kester
to
help
himself
all
at
once
,
and
to
take
his
bowl
up
to
the
master
's
room
and
keep
him
company
.
<EOS>
for
Daniel
be
in
bed
,
rest
from
his
weariness
,
and
bemoan
his
painful
bruise
whenever
he
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
his
mind
be
still
so
much
occupy
with
the
affair
of
the
previous
night
,
that
Bell
judge
rightly
that
a
new
listener
would
give
ease
to
his
body
as
well
as
to
his
mind
,
and
her
proposal
of
Kester
's
carry
up
his
breakfast
have
be
receive
by
Daniel
with
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
so
Kester
go
up
slowly
,
carry
his
over
-
full
basin
tenderly
,
and
seat
himself
on
the
step
lead
down
into
the
bed
-
room
(
for
level
have
not
be
calculate
when
the
old
house
be
build
)
face
his
master
,
who
,
half
sit
up
in
the
blue
check
bed
,
not
unwillingly
begin
his
relation
again
;
to
which
Kester
listen
so
attentively
,
that
his
spoon
be
often
arrest
in
its
progress
from
the
basin
to
his
mouth
,
open
ready
to
receive
it
,
while
he
gaze
with
unwinking
eye
at
Daniel
narrate
his
exploit
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
Daniel
have
fight
his
battle
o'er
again
to
every
auditor
within
his
reach
,
he
find
the
seclusion
of
his
chamber
rather
oppressive
,
without
even
the
usual
week
-
day
'
noise
below
;
so
after
dinner
,
though
far
from
well
,
he
come
down
and
wander
about
the
stable
and
the
field
near
to
the
house
,
consult
with
Kester
as
to
crop
and
manure
for
the
most
part
;
but
every
now
and
then
break
out
into
an
episodical
chuckle
over
some
part
of
last
night
's
proceeding
.
<EOS>
Kester
enjoy
the
day
even
more
than
his
master
,
for
he
have
no
bruise
to
remind
him
that
,
although
a
hero
,
he
be
also
flesh
and
blood
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
return
to
the
house
they
find
Philip
there
,
for
it
be
already
dusk
.
<EOS>
It
be
Kester
's
usual
Sunday
plan
to
withdraw
to
bed
at
as
early
an
hour
as
he
could
manage
to
sleep
,
often
in
winter
before
six
;
but
now
he
be
too
full
of
interest
in
what
Philip
may
have
to
tell
of
Monkshaven
news
to
forego
his
Sabbath
privilege
of
spend
the
evening
sit
on
the
chair
at
the
end
of
the
dresser
behind

<EOS>
Philip
be
as
close
to
Sylvia
as
he
could
possibly
get
without
give
her
offence
,
when
they
come
in
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
listless
and
civil
;
she
have
lose
all
that
active
feeling
towards
him
which
make
him
positively
distasteful
,
and
have
call
out
her
girlish
irritation
and
impertinence
.
<EOS>
She
now
be
rather
glad
to
see
him
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
He
bring
some
change
into
the
heavy
monotony
of
her
life
 
monotony
so
peaceful
until
she
have
be
stir
by
passion
out
of
that
content
with
the
small
daily
event
which
have
now
become
burdensome
recurrence
.
<EOS>
insensibly
to
herself
she
be
become
dependent
on
his
timid
devotion
,
his
constant
attention
;
and
he
,
<EOS>
lover
-
like
,
once
so
attract
,
in
spite
of
his
judgment
,
by
her
liveliness
and
piquancy
,
now
dote
on
her
languor
,
and
think
her
silence
more
sweet
than
word
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
only
just
arrive
when
master
and
man
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
to
afternoon
chapel
;
none
of
them
have
think
of
go
to
the
distant
church
;
worship
with
them
be
only
an
occasional
duty
,
and
this
day
their
mind
have
be
too
full
of
the
event
of
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
Daniel
sate
himself
heavily
down
in
his
accustomed
chair
,
the
three
-
corner
arm
-
chair
in
the
fireside
corner
,
which
no
one
think
of
anybody
else
ever
occupy
on
any
occasion
whatever
.
<EOS>
in
a
minute
or
two
he
interrupt
Philip
's
word
of
greeting
and
inquiry
by
break
out
into
the
story
of
the
rescue
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
but
to
the
mute
surprise
of
Sylvia
,
the
only
one
who
notice
it
,
Philip
's
face
,
instead
of
express
admiration
and
pleasant
wonder
,
lengthen
into
dismay
;
once
or
twice
he
begin
to
interrupt
,
but
stop
himself
as
if
he
would
consider
his
word
again
.
<EOS>
Kester
be
never
tired
of
hear
his
master
talk
;
by
long
live
together
they
understand
every
fold
of
each
other
's
mind
,
and
small
expression
have
much
significance
to
them
.
<EOS>
Bell
,
too
,
sate
thankful
that
her
husband
should
have
do
such
deed
.
<EOS>
only
Sylvia
be
make
uneasy
by
Philip
's
face
and
manner
.
<EOS>
when
Daniel
have
end
there
be
a
great
silence
,
instead
of
the
question
and
compliment
he
look
to
receive
.
<EOS>
He
become
testy
,
and
turn
to
Bell
,
say
,
    
"

<EOS>
Philip
go
very

,
and
then
more
sallow
than
usual
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
think
of
Charley
Kinraid
,
but
of
quite
another
thing
,
while
Daniel
have
tell
his
story
;
but
this
last
speech
of
the
old
man
be
bring
up
the
remembrance
that
be
always
quick
,
do
what
he
would

<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
<EOS>
,
then
he
say
,
    
"

They

<EOS>
this
be
rather
a
more
serious
account
of
the
progress
of
the
affair
than
any
one
have
calculate
upon
.
<EOS>
They
look
grave
upon
it
awhile
,
then
Daniel
take
heart
and
say
,

more
faintly
this
time

<EOS>
Philip

on
,
still
graver
than
before

boldly
continue
to
say
what
he
know
would
be
discordant
to
the

so
well

<EOS>
"

Philip
take
no

he

<EOS>
for
an
instant
there
be
dead
silence

<EOS>
the
woman
look
at
each

as

perhaps
Philip

His
sharp
irritated
way

so
new

that
the
tear
spring
to

and
her

Philip
see
it

<EOS>
He
plunge
headlong
into
some
other
subject
to
try
and
divert
attention
from
her
;
but
Daniel
be
too
ill
at
ease
to
talk
much
,
and
Bell
be
oblige
to
try
and
keep
up
the
semblance
of
conversation
,
with
an
occasional
word
or
two
from
Kester
,
who
seem
instinctively
to
fall
into
her
way
of
thinking
,
and
to
endeavour
to
keep
the
dark
thought
in
the
background
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
steal
off
to
bed
;
more
concerned
at
her
father
's
angry
way
of
speak
than
at
the
idea
of
his
be
amenable
to
law
for
what
he
have
do
;
the
one
be
a
sharp
present
evil
,
the
other
something
distant
and
unlikely
.
<EOS>
yet
a
dim
terror
of
this
latter
evil
hang
over
her
,
and
once
upstairs
she
throw
herself
on
her
bed
and
sob
.
<EOS>
Philip
hear
her
where
he
sate
near
the
bottom
of
the
short
steep
staircase
,
and
at
every
sob
the
cord
of
love
round
his
heart
seem
tighten
,
and
he
feel
as
if
he
must
there
and
then
do
something
to
console
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
instead
,
he
sit
on
talk
of
nothing
,
a
conversation
in
which
Daniel
join
with
somewhat
of
surliness
,
while
Bell
,
grave

anxious
,
keep
wistfully
look
from

to
the
other

desirous
of
glean
some
further
information
on
the
subject
,
which
have
begin
to
trouble
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
hope
some
chance
would
give
her
the
opportunity
of
privately
question
Philip
,
but
it
seem
to
be
equally
her
husband
's
wish
to
thwart
any
such
intention
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
remain
in
the
house

place
,
till
after
Philip
have
leave
,
although
he
be
evidently
so
much
fatigue
as
to
give
some
very
distinct
,
though
unintentional

hint
to
his
visitor
to

Bell

noise
she

the

in

on
look
round

she

Kester

face
press
against
the

and
,
reassure
,
she
softly
open
the
door

<EOS>
there
he
stand
in
the
dusk
outer
air
,
distinct
against
the
gray
darkness
beyond

and
in
his

<EOS>
Thy

not

and
I
dunnot

"
  
<EOS>
Kester
stand
still
;
then
he
shake
his
head
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
t
'
work
at
t

Randyvowse
as
a'm
afeare
on

<EOS>
some
folk
think
such
a

<EOS>
then

<EOS>
"
say
he
,
beseechingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Kester
 
'
she
begin
;
but
suddenly
change
,
she
say
,
"
God
bless
thee
,
my
man

come
in
and
lie
thee
down
on

and
I
will
cover
thee
up
wi

my

<EOS>
We
be
not
many
on
us
that
love
him
,
an
'
we

us
under
one
roof

an

niver
a

"
  
<EOS>
so
Kester
take
up
his
rest
in
the
house
-
place
that
night
,
and
none
know
of
it
besides
Bell
.
    
<EOS>
come
<EOS>
trouble
  
<EOS>
the
morning
bring
more
peace
if
it
do
not
entirely
dissipate
fear
.
<EOS>
Daniel
seem
to
have
get
over
his
irritability
,
and
be
unusually
kind
and
tender
to
wife
and
daughter
,
especially
strive
by
silent
little
deed
to
make
up
for
the
sharp
word
he
have
say
the
night
before
to
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
as
if
by
common
consent
,
all
allusion
to
the
Saturday
night
's
proceeding
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
They
speak
of
the
day
's
work
before
them
;
of
the
crop
to
be
sow
;
of
the
cattle
;
of
the
market
;
but
each
one
be
conscious
of
a
wish
to
know
more
distinctly
what
be
the
chance
of
the
danger
that
,
to
judge
from
Philip
's
word
,
hang
over
them
,
fall
upon
them
and
cut
them
off
from
all
these
place
for
the
come
day
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
long
to
send
Kester
down
into
Monkshaven
as
a
sort
of
spy
to
see
how
the
land
lie
;
but
she
dare
not
manifest
her
anxiety
to
her
husband
,
and
could
not
see
Kester
alone
.
<EOS>
She
wish
that
she
have
tell
him
to
go
to
the
town
,
when
she
have
have
him
to
herself
in
the
house
-
place
the
night
before
;
now
it
seem
as
though
Daniel
be
resolve
not
to
part
from
him
,
and
as
though
both
have
forget
that
any
peril
have
be
anticipate
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
,
in
like
manner
,
clung
together
,
not
speak
of
their
fear
,
yet
each
know
that
it
be
ever
present
in
the
other
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
so
thing
go
on
till
twelve
o'clock
 
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
if
at
any
time
that
morning
they
have
have
the
courage
to
speak
together
on
the
thought
which
be
engross
all
their
mind
,
it
be
possible
that
some
mean
may
have
be
find
to
avert
the
calamity
that
be
come
towards
them
with
swift
foot
.
<EOS>
but
among
the
uneducated
 
the
partially
educate
 
nay
,
even
the
weakly
educate
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
exist
which
prompt
the
futile
experiment
of
the
well
-
know
ostrich
.
<EOS>
They
imagine
that
,
by
close
their
own
eye
to
apprehend
evil
,
they
avert
it
.
<EOS>
the
expression
of
fear
be
suppose
to
accelerate
the
coming
of
its
cause
.
<EOS>
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
shrink
from
acknowledge
the
long
continuance
of
any
blessing
,
in
the
idea
that
when
unusual
happiness
be
speak
about
,
it
disappear
.
<EOS>
so
,
although
perpetual
complaint
of
past
or
present
grievance
and
sorrow
be
most
common
among
this
class
,
they
shrink
from
embody
apprehension
for
the
future
in
word
,
as
if
it
then
take
shape
and
draw
near
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
four
sate
down
to
dinner
,
but
not
one
of
them
be
incline
to
eat
.
<EOS>
the
food
be
scarcely
touch
on
their
plate
,
yet
they
be
try
to
make
talk
among
themselves
as
usual
<EOS>
;
they
seem
as
though
they
dare
not
let
themselves
be
silent
,
when
Sylvia
,
sit
opposite
to
the
window
,
see
Philip
at
the
top
of
the
brow
,
run
rapidly
towards
the
farm
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
full
of
the
anticipation
of
some
kind
of
misfortune
all
the
morning
that
she
feel
now
as
if
this
be
the
very
precursive
circumstance
she
have
be
expect
;
she
stand
up
,
turn
quite
white
,
and
,
point
with
her
finger
,
say
,
    
"
there
he
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
every
one
at
table
stand
up
too
.
<EOS>
an
instant
afterwards
,
Philip
,
breathless
,
be
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
gasp
out
,
"
They
be
come

<EOS>
the
warrant

.
<EOS>
You
must
go

<EOS>
I
hope
you
be

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
help
us
!
"
say
Bell
,
and
sate
suddenly
down
,
as
if
she
have
receive
a
blow
that
make
her
collapse
into
helplessness
;
but
she
get
up
again
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
fly
for
her
father
's
hat
.
<EOS>
He
really
seem
the
most
unmoved
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm

"
<EOS>
A'd

Philip

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
have
his
hat
on
his
head
by
this
time
;
and
Bell
,
wan
and
stiff
,
tremble
all
over
,
have
his
over
-
coat
,
and
his
leather
purse
with
the
few
coin
she
could
muster
,
ready
for
him
to
put
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
these
preparation
,
at
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
his
colour
change
from
its
ruddy
brown
.
  
<EOS>
"

hesitating

<EOS>
"
oh

"
for

lose
no

be
off

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where

"
<EOS>
ask
Bell
,
as
if
Philip
must
decide
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
anywhere
,
anywhere
,
out
of
this
house
 
say
haverstone
.
<EOS>
this
evening
,
I
will
go
and
meet
him
there
and
plan
further
;
only
be
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Philip
be
so
keenly
eager
,
he
hardly
take
note
at
the
time
of
Sylvia
's
one
vivid
look
of
unspoken
thank
,
yet
he
remember
it
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'll
dang
'em
dead
,
"
say
Kester
,
rush
to
the
door
,
for
he
see
what
the
other
do
not
 
that
all
chance
of
escape
be
over
;
the
constable
be
already
at
the
top
of
the
little
field
-
path
not
twenty
yard
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
hide
him
,
hide
him
,
"
cry
Bell
,
wring
her
hand
in
terror
;
for
she
,
indeed
they
all
,
know
that
flight
would
now
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Daniel
be
heavy
,
rheumatic
,
and
,
moreover
,
have
be
pretty
severely
bruise
on
that
unlucky
night
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
without
another
word
,
push
Daniel
before
him
upstairs
,
feel
that
his
own
presence
at
Haytersbank
Farm
at
that
hour
of
the
day
would
be
a
betrayal
.
<EOS>
They
have
just
time
to
shut
themselves
up
in
the
large
bed
-
room
,
before
they
hear
a
scuffle
and
the
constable
'
entry
down
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
in
,
"
say
Philip
,
as
Daniel
squeeze
himself
under
the
bed
;
and
then
they
hold
quite
still
,
Philip
as
much
conceal
by
the
scanty
,
blue
-
check
curtain
as
he
could
manage
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
hear
a
confusion
of
voice
below
,
a
hasty
moving
of
chair
,
a
banging
of
door
,
a
further
parley
,
and
then
a
woman
's
scream
,
shrill
and
pitiful
;
then
step
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
screech
spoil
all
,
"
sigh
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
in
one
instant
the
door
be
open
,
and
each
of
the
hider
be
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
constable
,
although
at
first
the
latter
stand
motionless
,
survey
the
apparently
empty
room
with
disappointment
.
<EOS>
then
in
another
moment
they
have
rush
at
Philip
's
leg
,
expose
as
these
be
.
<EOS>
They
draw
him
out
with
violence
,
and
then
let
him
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Measter
Hepburn
!
"
say
one
in
amaze
.
<EOS>
but
immediately
they
put
two
and
two
together
;
for
in
so
small
a
place
as
Monkshaven
every
one
's
relationship
and
connexion
,
and
even
liking
,
be
know
;
and
the
motive
of
Philip
's
come
out
to
Haytersbank
be
perfectly
clear
to
these
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
T

the
other

His

call
out
the
other

drag
Daniel
out
by
his
leg
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
kick
violently
,
and
come
out
from
his
hiding
-
place
in
a
less
ignominious
way
than
by
be
pull
out
by
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
He
shake
himself
,
and
then
turn
,
face
his
captor
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
wish

jerk
his

"
  
<EOS>
He
be
try
to
carry
it
off
with
bravado
,
but
Philip
see
that
he
have
receive
a
shock
,
from
his
sudden
look
of
withered
colour
and
shrink
feature
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not

Philip

money
into

<EOS>
"
You

Daniel

round
sharp
at

whisper

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
but
it
be
difficult
to
keep
up
this
tone
of
bravado
when
he
be
lead
a
prisoner
through
his
own
house

place
,
and
see
his
poor

quiver
and
shake

until

She

her
lip
several
time
with
an
uneasy
motion

as
if
she
would
fain

something
,
but
know
not
what

<EOS>
Sylvia
's
passionate
swollen
lip
and
her
beautiful
defiant

give
her
face
quite
a

"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

feyther

<EOS>
feyther
!
<EOS>
"
be
all
Sylvia
could
say
;
and
at
last
they
have
to
make
as
though
they
would
have
use
force
to
separate
her
from
their
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Philip
take
her
hand
,
and
softly
lead
her
back
to
her
weeping
mother
.
  
<EOS>
for
some
time
nothing
be
to
be
hear
in
the
little
farmhouse
kitchen
but
the
sobbing
and
wailing
of
the
woman
.
<EOS>
Philip
stand
by
silent
,
think
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
for
his
keen
sympathy
with
their
grief
,
what
have
best
be
do
next
.
<EOS>
Kester
,
after
some
growl
at
Sylvia
for
have
hold
back
the
uplifted
arm
which
he
think
may
have
save
Daniel
by
a
well
-
consider
blow
on
his
captor
as
they
enter
the
house
,
go
back
into
his
shippen
 
his
cell
for
meditation
and
consolation
,
where
he
may
hope
to
soothe
himself
before
go
out
to
his
afternoon
's
work
;
labour
which
his
master
have
plan
for
him
that
very
morning
,
with
a
strange
foresight
,
as
Kester
think
,
for
the
job
be
one
which
would
take
him
two
or
three
day
without
need
any
further
direction
than
those
he
have
receive
,
and
by
the
end
of
that
time
he
think
that
his
master
would
be
at
liberty
again
.
<EOS>
so
he
 
<EOS>
so
they
all
think
in
their
ignorance
and
inexperience
.
  
<EOS>
although
Daniel
himself
be
unreasone
,
hasty
,
impulsive
 
in
a
word
,
often
think
and
act
very
foolishly
 
yet
,
somehow
,
either
from
some
quality
in
his
character
,
or
from
the
loyalty
of
nature
in
those
with
whom
he
have
to
deal
in
his
every
-
day
life
,
he
have
make
his
place
and
position
clear
as
the
arbiter
and
law
-
giver
of
his
household
.
<EOS>
on
his
decision
,
as
that
of
husband
,
father
,
master
,
perhaps
superior
nature
wait
.
<EOS>
so
now
that
he
be
go
and
have
leave
them
in
such
strange
new
circumstance
so
suddenly
,
it
seem
as
though
neither
Bell
nor
Sylvia
know
exactly
what
to
do
when
their
grief
be
spend
,
so
much
have
every
household
action
and
plan
be
regulate
by
the
thought
of
him
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
Philip
have
slowly
be
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
he
be
more
want
at
Monkshaven
to
look
after
Daniel
's
interest
,
to
learn
what
be
the
legal
probability
in
consequence
of
the
old
man
's
arrest
,
and
to
arrange
for
his
family
accordingly
,
than
stand
still
and
silent
in
the
Haytersbank
kitchen
,
too
full
of
fellow
-
feeling
and
heavy
foreboding
to
comfort
,
awkwardly
unsympathetic
in
appearance
from
the
very
aching
of
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
so
when
his
aunt
,
with
instinctive
sense
of
regularity
and
propriety
,
begin
to
put
away
the
scarcely
taste
dinner
,
and
Sylvia
,
blind
with
crying
,
and
convulsively
sob
,
be
yet
try
to
help
her
mother
,
Philip
take
his
hat
,
and
brush
it
round
and
round
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
say
,
    
"
I
think
I
will
just
go
back
,
and
see
how
matter
stand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
a
more
distinct
plan
in
his
head
than
these
word
imply
,
but
it
depend
on
so
many
contingency
of
which
he
be
ignorant
that
he
say
only
these
few
word
;
and
with
a
silent
resolution
to
see
them
again
that
day
,
but
a
dread
of
be
compel
to
express
his
fear
,
so
far
beyond
theirs
,
he
go
off
without
say
anything
more
.
<EOS>
then
Sylvia
lift
up
her
voice
with
a
great
cry
.
<EOS>
somehow
she
have
expect
him
to
do
something
 
<EOS>
what
,
she
do
not
know
;
but
he
be
go
,
and
they
be
leave
without
stay
or
help
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
thee
,
hush
thee
,
"
say
her
mother
,
tremble
all
over
herself
;
"
it
be
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
niver
think
he
would
leave
us
,
"
moan
Sylvia
,
half
in
her
mother
's
arm
,
and
thinking
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
take
the
word
as
apply
to
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
would
niver
ha
'
leave
us
,
my
wench
,
if
he
could
ha
'
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mother
,
mother
,
it
be
Philip
as
have
leave
us
,
and
he
could
ha
'
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
come
back
,
or
mebbe
send
,
I
will
be
bind
.
<EOS>
Leastways
he
will
be
go
to
see
feyth
,
and
he
will
need
comfort
most
on
all
,
in
a
fremd
place
 
in
Bridewell
 
and
niver
a
morsel
of
victual
or
a
piece
o
'
money
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
she
sate
down
,
and
weep
the
dry
hot
tear
that
come
with
such
difficulty
to
the
eye
of
the
aged
.
<EOS>
and
so
 
first
one
grieving
,
and
<EOS>
then
the
other
,
and
each
drain
her
own
heart
of
every
possible
hope
by
way
of
comfort
,
alternately
try
to
cheer
and
console
 
the
February
afternoon
pass
away
;
the
continuous
rain
close
in
the
daylight
even
earlier
than
usual
,
and
add
to
the
dreariness
,
with
the
natural
accompaniment
of
wail
wind
,
come
with
long
sweep
over
the
moor
,
and
make
the
sobbing
at
the
window
that
always
sound
like
the
gasp
of
some
one
in
great
agony
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
Philip
have
hasten
back
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
umbrella
,
he
have
to
face
the
drive
rain
for
the
great
part
of
the
way
;
but
he
be
thankful
to
the
weather
,
for
it
keep
man
indoor
,
and
he
want
to
meet
no
one
,
but
to
have
time
to
think
and
mature
his
plan
.
<EOS>
the
town
itself
be
,
so
to
speak
,
in
mourning
.
<EOS>
the
rescue
of
the
sailor
be
a
distinctly
popular
movement
;
the
subsequent
violence
(
which
have
,
indeed
,
go
much
further
than
have
be
describe
,
after
Daniel
leave
it
)
be
,
in
general
,
consider
as
only
a
kind
of
due
punishment
inflict
in
wild
justice
on
the
press
-
gang
and
their
abettor
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
of
the
Monkshaven
people
be
,
therefore
,
in
decide
opposition
to
the
vigorous
step
take
by
the
county
magistrate
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
an
appeal
from
the
naval
officer
in
charge
of
the
impressment
service
,
have
call
out
the
militia
(
from
a
distant
and
inland
county
)
station
within
a
few
mile
,
and
have
thus
summarily
quench
the
riot
that
be
continue
on
the
Sunday
morning
after
a
somewhat
languid
fashion
;
the
great
part
of
the
destruction
of
property
have
be
accomplish
during
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
still
there
be
little
doubt
but
that
the
violence
would
have
be
renew
as
evening
draw
on
,
and
the
more
desperate
part
of
the
population
and
the
enraged
sailor
have
have
the
Sabbath
leisure
to
brood
over
their
wrong
,
and
to
encourage
each
other
in
a
passionate
attempt
at
redress
,
or
revenge
.
<EOS>
so
the
authority
be
quite
justified
in
the
decide
step
they
have
take
,
both
in
their
own
estimation
then
,
and
now
,
in
ours
,
look
back
on
the
affair
in
cold
blood
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
time
feeling
run
strongly
against
them
;
and
all
mean
of
express
itself
in
action
be
prevent
,
man
brood
sullenly
in
their
own
house
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
as
the
representative
of
the
family
,
the
head
of
which
be
now
suffer
for
his
deed
in
the
popular
cause
,
would
have
meet
with
more
sympathy
,
ay
,
and
more
respect
than
he
imagine
,
as
he
go
along
the
street
,
glance
from
side
to
side
,
fearful
of
meet
some
who
would
shy
him
as
the
relation
of
one
who
have
be
ignominiously
take
to
Bridewell
a
few
hour
before
.
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
this
wincing
of
Philip
's
from
observation
and
remark
,
he
never
dream
of
act
otherwise
than
as
become
a
brave
true
friend
.
<EOS>
and
this
he
do
,
and
would
have
do
,
from
a
natural
faithfulness
and
constancy
of
disposition
,
without
any
special
regard
for
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
his
service
be
need
in
the
shop
;
business
which
he
have
leave
at
a
moment
's
warning
await
him
,
unfinished
;
but
at
this
time
he
could
not
bear
the
torture
of
give
explanation
,
and
allege
reason
to
the
languid
intelligence
and
slow
sympathy
of
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
office
of
Mr.
Donkin
,
the
old
establish
and
most
respected
attorney
in
Monkshaven
 
he
who
have
be
employ
to
draw
up
the
law
paper
and
deed
of
partnership
consequent
on
Hepburn
and
Coulson
succeed
to
the
shop
of
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
Brothers
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
know
Philip
from
this
circumstance
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
nearly
every
one
in
Monkshaven
know
each
other
;
if
not
enough
to
speak
to
,
at
least
enough
to
be
acquaint
with
the
personal
appearance
and
reputation
of
most
of
those
whom
they
meet
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
Mr.
Donkin
have
a
favourable
opinion
of
Philip
;
and
perhaps
for
this
reason
the
latter
have
a
short
time
to
wait
before
he
obtain
an
interview
with
the
head
of
the
house
,
than
many
of
the
client
who
come
for
that
purpose
from
town
or
country
for
many
mile
round
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
usher
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
sate
with
his
spectacle
push
up
on
his
forehead
,
ready
to
watch
his
countenance
and
listen
to
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
afternoon
,
Mr.
Hepburn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
afternoon
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
hesitate
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
become
impatient
,
and
tap
with
the
finger
of
his
left
hand
on
his
desk
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
sensitive
nerve
feel
and
rightly
interpret
the
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
sir
,
I
be
come
to
speak
to
you
about
Daniel
Robson
,
of
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Daniel
Robson
?
"
say
Mr.
Donkin
,
after
a
short
pause
,
to
try
and
compel
Philip
into
speed
in
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
be
be
take
up
on
account
of
this
affair
,

,
about

on
Saturday
night

<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
the
name
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Donkin
's
face
become
graver
,
and
the
expression
more
concentrated
.
<EOS>
look
up
suddenly
at
Philip
,
he
say
,
"
You
be
aware
that
I
be
the
clerk
to
the
magistrate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
in
a
tone
that
indicate
the
unexpressed

what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
I
be
.
<EOS>
and
so
of
course
,
if
you
want
my
service
or
advice
in
favour
of
a
prisoner
whom
they
have
commit
,

you

that
be
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
 
very
!
"
say
Philip
;
and
then
he
be
again
silent
for
a
period
;
long
enough
to
make
the
busy
attorney
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Hepburn
,
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
deal
to
ask
of
you
;
for
you
see
I
do
not
rightly
understand
what
to
do
;
and
yet
I
be
all
as
Daniel
's
wife
and
daughter
have
to
look
to
;
and
I
have
their
grief
heavy
on
my
heart
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
tell
me
what
be
to
be
do
with
Daniel

could
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
bring
up
before

morning
for
final
examination

along
with

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

nod
,
as
if

too
precious
to

<EOS>
"
and
when
will
he
go

"
ask
poor
Philip
,
in
dismay

<EOS>
"
to

morrow
:
most
probably
as
soon

<EOS>
"
only

say
Philip
,
his
heart
get
full
;
more
from
Mr.
Donkin
's
manner
than
from
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
can
they
do
to

<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
Mr.

half
smile
at

why

hang
him

to

He

be
either
a

in
the
second
degree

,
as
such

liable

<EOS>
I

with
sharp

in

<EOS>
He
have
never

there
be

up

I
come

<EOS>
Mr.

really
more
concerned

rioter
than
he
be
aware
;
and
he
be
aware
of
more
interest
than
he
care
to
express

so
he
soften
his
tone
a
little
,

try
to
give
the
good
advice

power

"
You
would
better
go
to
Edward

He

the

He

to

You
can

better

follow

glance
furtively
at
Mr.

then
,
once
more
have
recourse
to
brush
his

he

in

low
voice
    
<EOS>
"
You

Philip
go
quickly
along

ponder
upon
the
meaning
of
all
that

what
he

<EOS>
He
have
make
his
plan
pretty
clearly
out
by
the
time
he
arrive
at
Mr.

's
smart
door
in
one
of
the
new
street
on

<EOS>
a
clerk
as
smart

answer
Philip

knock

to
his
inquiry

whether
Mr.

<EOS>
probably
the
clerk
of
an
old

establish
attorney
would
not
have
give
so
many
particular
as

,
as
it
happen
it
be
of
no

the
unnecessary
information
make
no
impression
on

he

the

over

go
up

some
timidity
(
for

as

ask

Philip
come
up

the
strange
consciousness

stare
make
her
uncomfortable

and
call
the
faint
flush
to
her
pale
cheek
,
and
at
length
compel
her

as
it

to
speak

and
break
the
spell
of
the
silence

so

curiously

say
he
,
as
he
wrap
her
well
up
in
the
cart
,
and
place
the
bundle
of
cloak
and
thing
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
along
the
street
,
in
the
jolt
cart
,
as
long
as
Hester
could
see
the
misty
light
stream
out
of
the
shop
door
,
so
long
be
Philip
stand
bareheade
in
the
rain
look
after
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
it
be
not
her
own
poor
self
that
attract
his
linger
gaze
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
thought
of
the
person
she
be
bind
to
.
    
<EOS>
a
DREARY
vigil
  
<EOS>
through
the
dark
rain
,
against
the
cold
wind
,
shake
over
the
rough
stone
,
go
Hester
in
the
little
tax
-
cart
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
keep
rise
against
her
fate
;
the
hot
tear
come
unbidden
to
her
eye
.
<EOS>
but
rebellious
heart
be
soothe
,
and
hot
tear
be
send
back
to
their
source
before
the
time
come
for
her
alighting
.
  
<EOS>
the
driver
turn
his
horse
in
the
narrow
lane
,
and
shout
after
her
an
injunction
to
make
haste
as
,
with
her
head
bent
low
,
she
struggle
down
to
the
path
to
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
light
in
the
window
from
the
top
of
the
brow
,
and
involuntarily
she
slacken
her
pace
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
Bell
Robson
,
and
would
Sylvia
recollect
her
?
<EOS>
if
she
do
not
how
awkward
it
would
be
to
give
the
explanation
of
who
she
be
,
and
what
her
errand
be
,
and
why
she
be
send
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
must
be
do
;
so
on
she
go
,
and
stand
within
the
little
porch
,
she
knock
faintly
at
the
door
;
but
in
the
bluster
of
the
element
the
sound
be
lose
.
<EOS>
again
she
knock
,
and
now
the
murmur
of
woman
's
voice
inside
be
hush
,
and
some
one
come
quickly
to
the
door
,
and
open
it
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
although
her
face
be
completely
in
shadow
,
of
course
Hester
know
her
well
;
but
she
,
if
indeed
she
would
have
recognize
Hester
less
disguised
,
do
not
know
in
the
least
who
the
woman
,
muffle
up
in
a
great
cloak
,
with
her
hat
tie
down
with
a
silk
handkerchief
,
stand
in
the
porch
at
this
time
of
night
,
could
be
.
<EOS>
nor
,
indeed
,
be
she
in
a
mood
to
care
or
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
She
say
hastily
,
in
a
voice
render
hoarse
and
arid
with
grief
:
  
"
go
away
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
house
for
stranger
to
come
to
.
<EOS>
We
have
enough
on
our
own
to
think
on
;
"
and
she
hastily
shut
the
door
in
Hester
's
face
,
before
the
latter
could
put
together
the
right
word
in
which
to
explain
her
errand
.
<EOS>
Hester
stand
outside
in
the
dark
,
wet
porch
discomfit
,
and
wonder
how
next
to
obtain
a
hearing
through
the
shut
and
bolt
door
.
<EOS>
not
long
do
she
stand
,
however
;
some
one
be
again
at
the
door
,
talk
in
a
voice
of
distress
and
remonstrance
,
and
slowly
unbar
the
bolt
.
<EOS>
a
tall
,
thin
figure
of
an
elderly
woman
be
see
against
the
warm
fire
-
light
inside
as
soon
as
the
door
be
open
;
a
hand
be
put
out
,
like
that
which
take
the
dove
into
the
ark
,
and
Hester
be
draw
into
the
warmth
and
the
light
,
while
Bell
's
voice
go
on
speak
to
Sylvia
before
address
the
dripping
stranger
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
night
to

it

<EOS>
Bell
sate
down
,
and
throw
her
apron
over
her
poor
worn
face
,
as
if
decently
to
shield
the
sign
of
her
misery
from
a
stranger
's
gaze
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
all
tear

swollen
,
and
look
askance
and
almost
fiercely
at
the
stranger
who
have
make
good
her
intrusion

be
draw

as
it

to
her
mother

and

put
her
arm
round
her
waist

and
almost
lie
across
her
lap

still

at
Hester
with
cold
,
distrustful
eye
,
the
expression
of
which
repel
and
daunt
that
poor
,
unwilling
messenger
,
and
make
her
silent
for
a
minute
or
so
after
her
entrance
.
<EOS>
Bell
suddenly
put
down
her
apron
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're

touch
by
the
poor

's
evident
effort
to
forget
her
own
grief
in
the
duty
of
hospitality
,
and
love
Bell
from
that
moment

<EOS>
"

up
and
about

make
for
the
place
where
she
keep
her

almost
before
Hester

<EOS>
She
hardly

be
send
to
York
,
in
the
possession
of
the
idea

<EOS>
She
do
not

or
care
how

in

wild
night

be
to
get
to

all
she
think
of
be
,
that
she
may
go
and
see
her

<EOS>
but
Sylvia
take
in
more
point
than
her
mother
,
and
,
almost
suspiciously
,
begin
to
question
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be

what

out
the
sad
reproach

to
distrust

"

break
out
into
a
wild
cry

that
carry
with

more
conviction

agony

She
look
eagerly
at
Hester
for
an
answer

this
last
question

which
she
have
put
in

entreat

so

and
it
be
Hester
who
pick

up

and
at

,
after
many
vain
attempt
by
the
grief

shake
woman

it
be
Hester
who
tie
the

Sylvia
begin
to
cry
,
but
Hester
have
no
time
to
attend
to
her
,
even
have
she
the
inclination
:
all
her
care
be
need
to
help
the
hasty

totter
step
of
the
wife
who
be
feebly
speed
up
the
wet
and
slippery
brow

her
husband

<EOS>
all
Bell
think
of
be
that

be
at
the
end
of
her
toil

<EOS>
She
hardly
understand
when
she
be
to

her
weary
heart

one
idea
 
that
each
step

tired
and
exhaust
with
her
quick
walk
up
hill

battle
all
the

with
wind

she
could
hardly
have
hold
up
another
minute

cart
in

lane

and
Hester
have
almost
to
lift
her
on
to
the
front
seat
by
the
driver

She
cover
and
wrap
up
the
poor
old
woman

afterwards
place
herself
in
the
straw
at
the
back
of
the

pack
up
close
by
the
shivering
,
weep
Sylvia

<EOS>
neither

Hester
's
tender
conscience
smote
her
for
her
silence
before
they
have
reach
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
say
some
kind
word
to
Sylvia

and
yet
know
not
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
without

why
,
or
reason
upon
it
,
she
hit
upon
Philip
's
message
as
the
good
comfort
in
her
power
to
give
.
<EOS>
She
have
deliver
it
before

but
it
have
be
apparently
little

sadly

<EOS>
They

over
the
paved
street

and
not
a

<EOS>
They
be
now
at

door

which

open
to

<EOS>
the
voice
be
so
plaintive
,
so
full
of
tear
,
that
Hester
could
not
but
yearn
towards
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
She
bend
over
and
kiss
her
cheek
,
and
then
clamber
unaide
down
by
the
wheel
on
the
dark
side
of
the
cart
.
<EOS>
wistfully
she
long
for
one
word
of
thank
or
recognition
from
Philip
,
in
whose
service
she
have
perform
this
hard
task

but
he

and
on
cast
a
further
glance
back
as

corner

,
she
see
Philip
lift
Sylvia
carefully
down
in
his
arm
from
her
footing
on
the
top
of

and
then
they
all
go
into
the
light
and
the
warmth
,
the
door
be
shut
,
the

cart
drive
briskly
away

and
Hester
,
in
rain

and
cold
,
and
darkness
,
go
homeward
with
her
tired

reception
of
his
beloved

<EOS>
He
have
a
strong
apprehension
of
the
probable
fate
of
poor
Daniel
Robson
;
he
have
a
warm
sympathy
with
the
miserable
distress
of
the
wife
and

but
still
at
the
back
of
his
mind
his
spirit

as
if
this

to
them
a
festal
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
even

<EOS>
Poor
Bell

sit
down
almost
as
soon
as
she
enter
the
room
,
so
worn
out
be
she
with
fatigue
and
excitement
;
yet
she
grudge
every
moment
which
separate
her
,
as
she
think

from

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
It

"
reply
he
,
almost
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
You

with
these

<EOS>
suddenly

,
    
"
<EOS>

who
be

<EOS>
"
can
not

"
repeat
Bell
.
<EOS>
"
I
could

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
ask

hope
she

and
be
content
with

so
there

nothing

but
for
him
to
go

in

of

<EOS>
"
It

Philip
be

and
the
excitement
of
Bell

once
more

into

despondency

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
however
,
rouse
herself
enough
to
take
off
her
mother
's
wet
clothe
,
and
she
take
them
timidly
into
the
kitchen

arrange
them
before
Phoebe

fire

<EOS>
Phoebe
open
her
lip
once
or
twice
to
speak
in
remonstrance
,
and
then
,
with
an
effort
,
gulp
her
word
down
;
for
her
sympathy
,
like
that
of
all
the
rest
of

of
Daniel

his

<EOS>
Sylvia
find

"

say
Sylvia
,
pour
out
a
cup
.
  
<EOS>
just
then
he
return
,
and
something
in
his
look
,
some
dumb
expression
of
delight
at
her
occupation
,
make
her
blush
and
hesitate
for
an
instant
;
but
then
she
go
on
,
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
ready
,
say
something
a
little
incoherent
all
the
time
about
her
mother
's
need
of

.
<EOS>
after
tea
Bell
Robson
's
weariness
become
so
extreme
,
that
Philip
and
Sylvia
urge
her
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
She
resist
a
little
,
partly
out
of

manner

and
partly
because
she
keep
fancy
,
poor
woman
,
that
somehow
or
other
her

may
send
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
about
seven
o'clock
Sylvia
persuade
her
to
come
upstairs

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
too
,
bade
Philip
good

night
,
and
his
look
follow
the
last
wave
of
her
dress
as
she
disappear
up
the
stair
;
then
lean
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
he
gaze
at
vacancy
and
think
deeply
 
for
how
long
he
know
not
,
so
intent
be
his
mind
on
the
chance
of
futurity

<EOS>
He

"
  
"

Philip
,
eagerly

<EOS>
when
he
turn

fire
,
lean
her
head
against
the
stone
mantel

piece
for
the
comparative
coolness

<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
at
first
,
or
take
any
notice
of

<EOS>
He
watch
her
furtively
,
and
see
that
she
be
cry
,
the
tear
run
down
her
cheek
,
and
she
too
much
absorb
in
her
thought
to
wipe
them
away
with
her
apron
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
turn
over
in
his
mind
what
he
could
best
say
to
comfort
her
(
his
heart
,
like
her
,
be
almost
too
full
for
word
)
,
she
suddenly
look
him
full
in
the
face
,
say
,
    
"
Philip

will

<EOS>
Her
open
lip
tremble
while
await
his
answer
,
the
tear
come
up
and
fill
her
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
the
question
he
have
most
dreaded
;
it
lead
to
the
terror
that
possess
his
own
mind
,
but
which
he
have
hope
to
keep
out
of
hers

<EOS>
He
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"

she
,
impatiently
,
with
a
little
passionate
gesture
.
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
He
have
only
make
it
bad
by
consideration

blindfold
at

in
a
half

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
He
go
to
the

door
and
ask
if
the
gruel
be
not
ready
,
so
anxious
be
he
to
stop
the
conversation
at
this
point
;
but
Phoebe
,
who
hold
her
young
master
in

little
respect

scold
him
for
a
stupid

who

that
gruel

He
have

what

"
<EOS>
ask
she
,
keep
down
her
agitation
to
look
at
Philip
the
more
sharply
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
never
slacken
their
penetrating
gaze
at
his
countenance
,
until
he
reply
,
with
the
utmost
unwillingness
,
and
most
apparent
confusion
,
    
"
They
may
send
him
to
Botany
Bay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
hold
back
a
bad
contingency
,
and
he
be
mortally
afraid
that
she
would
perceive
this
reserve
.
<EOS>
but
what
he
do
say
be
so
much
beyond
her
utmost
apprehension
,
which
have
only
reach
to
various
term
of
imprisonment
,
that
she
do
not
imagine
the
dark
shadow
lurk
behind
.
<EOS>
what
he
have
say
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
dilate
,
her
lip
blanch
,
her
pale
cheek
grow
yet
paler
.
<EOS>
after
a
minute
's
look
into
his
face
,
as
if
fascinate
by
some
horror
,
she
stumble
backwards
into
the
chair
in
the
chimney
comer
,
and
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
moan
out
some
inarticulate
word
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
on
his
knee
by
her
,
dumb
from
excess
of
sympathy
,
kiss
her
dress
,
all
unfelt
by
her
;
he
murmur
half
-
word
,
he
begin
passionate
sentence
that
die
away
upon
his
lip
;
and
she
 
<EOS>
she
think
of
nothing
but
her
father
,
and
be
possess
and
rapt
out
of
herself
by
the
dread
of
lose
him
to
that
fearful
country
which
be
almost
like
the
grave
to
her
,
so
all
but
impassable
<EOS>
be
the
gulf
.
<EOS>
but
Philip
know
that
it
be
possible
that
the
separation
impend
may
be
that
of
the
dark
,
mysterious
grave
 
that
the
gulf
between
the
father
and
child
may
indeed
be
that
which
no
living

breathing

warm
human
creature
can
ever
cross

<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
!
"
say
he
,
 
and
all
their
conversation
have
to
be
carry
on
in
low
tone
and
whisper
,
for
fear
of
the
listening
ear
above
<EOS>
,
 
"
do
not

do
not

thou'rt
rend
my

<EOS>
oh

Sylvie

there

<EOS>

"
say
she
,
put
down
her
hand
,
and
look
at
him
as
if
her
look
could
pierce
his
soul
;
"
who
talk
o

touch
his
life
?
<EOS>
Thou're
go
crazy
,
Philip
,
I
think
;
"
but
she
do
not
think
so
,
although
she
would
fain
have
believe
it
.
<EOS>
in
her
keen
agony
she
read
his
thought
as
though
they
be
an
open
page
;
she
sate
there
,
upright
and
stony
,
the
conviction
creep
over
her
face
like
the
grey
shadow
of
death
.
<EOS>
no
more
tear
,
no
more
trembling
,
almost
no
more
breathing
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
see
her
,
and
yet
she
hold
his
eye
,
and
he
fear
to
make
the
effort
necessary
to
move
or
to
turn
away
,
lest
the
shun
motion
should
carry
conviction
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
conviction
of
the
probable
danger
to
her
father
's
life
be
already
there
:
it
be
that
that
be
calm
her
down
,
tighten
her
muscle
,
brace
her
nerve
.
<EOS>
in
that
hour
she
lose
all
her
early
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
he
may
be
hang

"
say
she
,
low
and
solemnly
,
after
a
long
pause
.
<EOS>
Philip
turn
away
his
face
,
and
do
not
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
again
deep
silence
,
break
only
by
some
homely
sound
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
mother
must
not
know
on
it
,
"
say
Sylvia
,
in
the
same
tone
in
which
she
have

"
It
be
t

"
more

maybe
he
will
be

in
innocent
after

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
Sylvia
,
heavily
,
as
one
without
hope
 
as
if
she
be
read
some
dreadful
doom
in
the
tablet
of
the

deaden
the

at
Philip

and
wring
it
with
convulsive
force
,
till
the
pain
that

nearly
more
than
he

<EOS>
no

touch
such
agony

irrepressibly

as
he
would
have
do
it
to

he
bend
over
her

her

always

<EOS>
GLOOMY
day
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
money
in
the
Fosters
'
bank
,
not
so
much
as
it
may
have
be
if
he
have
not
have
to
pay
for
the
furniture
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
much
of
this
furniture
be
old
,
and
have
belong
to
the
brother
Foster
,
and
they
have
let
Philip
have
it
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
;
but
still
the
purchase
of
it
have
diminish
the
amount
of
his
saving
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
sum
which
he
possess
he
draw
largely
 
<EOS>
he
draw
all
 
nay
,
he
overdraw
his
account
somewhat
,
to
his
former
master
'
dismay
,
although
the
kindness
of
their
heart
overrule
the
hard
argument
of
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
all
be
want
to
defend
Daniel
Robson
at
the
approach
York
assize
.
<EOS>
His
wife
have
hand
over
to
Philip
all
the
money
or
money
's
worth
she
could
lay
her
hand
upon
.
<EOS>
Daniel
himself
be
not
one
to
be
much
beforehand
with
the
world
;
but
to
Bell
's
thrifty
imagination
the
round
golden
guinea
,
tie
up
in
the
old
stocking
-
foot
against
rent
-
day
,
seem
a
mint
of
money
on
which
Philip
may
draw
infinitely
.
<EOS>
as
yet
she
do
not
comprehend
the
extent
of
her
husband
's
danger
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
go
about
like
one
in
a
dream
,
keep
back
the
hot
tear
that
may
interfere
with
the
course
of
life
she
have
prescribe
for
herself
in
that
terrible
hour
when
she
first
learn
all
.
<EOS>
every
penny
of
money
either
she
or
her
mother
could
save
go
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
Kester
's
hoard
,
too
,
be
place
in
Hepburn
's
hand
at
Sylvia
's
earnest
entreaty
;
for
Kester
have
no
great
opinion
of
Philip
's
judgment
,
and
would
rather
have
take
his
money
straight
himself
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
and
beg
him
to
use
it
for
his
master
's
behoof
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
anything
,
the
noiseless
breach
between
Kester
and
Philip
have
widen
of
late
.
<EOS>
It
be
seed
-
time
,
and
Philip
,
in
his
great
anxiety
for
every
possible
interest
that
may
affect
Sylvia
,
and
also
as
some
distraction
from
his
extreme
anxiety
about
her
father
,
have
take
to
study
agriculture
of
an
evening
in
some
old
book
which
he
have
borrow
 
_
<EOS>
the
Farmer
's
Complete
Guide
_
,
and
such
like
;
and
from
time
to
time
he
come
down
upon
the
practical
dog
Kester
with
direction
gather
from
the
theory
in
his
book
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
two
fall
out
,
but
without
many
word
.
<EOS>
Kester
persevere
in
his
old
way
,
make
light
of
Philip
and
his
book
in
manner
and
action
,
till
at
length
Philip
withdraw
from
the
contest
.
<EOS>
"
many
a
man
may
lead
a
horse
to
water
,
but
there
be
few
can
make
him
drink
,
"
and
Philip
certainly
be
not
one
of
those
few
.
<EOS>
Kester
,
indeed
,
look
upon
him
with
jealous
eye
on
many
account
.
<EOS>
He
have
favour
Charley
Kinraid
as
a
lover
of
Sylvia
's
;
and
though
he
have
no
idea
of
the
truth
 
though
he
believe
in
the
drowning
of
the
specksioneer
as
much
as
any
one
 
yet
the
year
which
have
elapse
since
Kinraid
's
suppose
death
be
but
a
very
short
while
to
the
middle
-
aged
man
,
who
forget
how
slowly
time
pass
with
the
young
;
and
he
could
often
have
scold
Sylvia
,
if
the
poor
girl
have
be
a
whit
less
heavy
at
heart
than
she
be
,
for
let
Philip
come
so
much
about
her
 
<EOS>
come
,
though
it
be
on
her
father
's
business
.
<EOS>
for
the
darkness
of
their
common
dread
draw
them
together
,
occasionally
to
the
comparative
exclusion
of
Bell
and
Kester
,
which
the
latter
perceive
and
resent
.
<EOS>
Kester
even
allow
himself
to
go
so
far
as
to
wonder
what
Philip
could
want
with
all
the
money
,
which
to
him
seem
unaccountable
;
and
once
or
twice
the
ugly
thought
cross
his
mind
,
that
shop
conduct
by
young
man
be
often
not
so
profitable
as
when
guide
by
old
head
,
and
that
some
of
the
coin
pour
into
Philip
's
keeping
may
have
another
destination
than
the
defence
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
Poor
Philip
!
<EOS>
and
he
be
spend
all
his
own
,
and
more
than
all
his
own
money
,
and
no
one
ever
know
it
,
as
he
have
bind
down
his
friendly
banker
to
secrecy
.
  
<EOS>
once
only
Kester
venture
to
speak
to
Sylvia
on
the
subject
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
She
have
follow
her
cousin
to
the
field
just
in
front
of
their
house
,
just
outside
the
porch
,
to
ask
him
some
question
she
dare
not
put
in
her
mother
's
presence
 
<EOS>
(
Bell
,
indeed
,
in
her
anxiety
,
usually
absorb
all
the
question
when
Philip
come
)
 
and
stand
,
after
Philip
have
bid
her
good
-
by
,
hardly
think
about
him
at
all
,
but
look
unconsciously
after
him
as
he
ascend
the
brow
;
and
at
the
top
he
have
turn
to
take
a
last
glance
at
the
place
his
love
inhabit
,
and
,
see
her
,
he
have
wave
his
hat
in
gratified
farewell
.
<EOS>
She
,
meanwhile
,
be
rouse
from
far
other
thought
than
of
him
,
and
of
his
now
acknowledge
love
,
by
the
motion
against
the
sky
,
and
be
turn
back
into
the
house
when
she
hear
Kester
's
low
hoarse
call
,
and
see
him
stand
at
the
shippen
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
hither
,
wench
,
"
say
he
,
indignantly
;
"
be
this
a
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
court
?
"
say
she
,
draw
up
her
head
,
and
look
back
at
him
with
proud
defiance
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay

<EOS>
what
other
mak

<EOS>
is't
when

<EOS>
It
be
what

<EOS>
i

it

a
time
for
a
wench
to
go
courtin

when
her
feyth

prison
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
consciousness
as
he
utter
these
last
word
that
he
be
cruel
and
unjust
and
go
too
far
,
yet
carry
on
to
say
them
by
his
hot
jealousy
against
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
continue
look
at
him
without
speak
:
she
be
too
much
offend
for
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou

It

<EOS>
Her

draw
up
,
show
her
small
glittering

,
which
be
scarcely
apart
as
she
breathe
out

"
  
<EOS>
then
,
as
if
fearful
that
her
self
-
command
may
give
way
,
she
turn
into
the
house
;
and
go
through
the
kitchen
like
a
blind
person
<EOS>
,
she
go
up
to
her
now
unused
chamber
,
and
throw
herself
,
face
downwards
,
flat
on
her
bed
,
almost
smother
herself

<EOS>
ever
since
Daniel

decay
that

She
lose
her
reticence
of

and
often
talk
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
so
much
forethought
as
of
old
;
slight
difference
,
it
be
true
,
but
which
,
with
some
other
of
the

description
,
give
foundation
for
the
homely
expression
which
some
now
apply
to
Bell
,
"
She
will
never

woman
again

<EOS>
this
afternoon
she
have
cry
herself
to

in

after
Philip

departure

<EOS>
She
have

half
an

afterwards
she

he
never
speak
again
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
in
look
,
word
,
manner
,
he
be
like
a
thoughtful
,
tender
brother
;
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
nothing
more
in
the
presence
of
the
great
dread
which
loom
large
upon
him
after
every
conversation
with
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Donkin
have
be
right
in
his
prognostication
.
<EOS>
government
take
up
the
attack
on
the
rendezvous
with
a
high
and
heavy
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
assert
authority
which
have
be
of
late
too
often
brave
.
<EOS>
an
example
must
be
make
,
to
strike
dismay
into
those
who
oppose
and
defy
the
press
-
gang
;
and
all
the
minor
authority
who
hold
their
power
from
Government
be
in
a
similar
manner
severe
and
relentless
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
.
<EOS>
so
the
attorney
,
who
go
over
to
see
the
prisoner
in
York
Castle
,
tell
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
add
that
Daniel
still
retain
his
pride
in
his
achievement
,
and
could
not
be
bring
to
understand
the
dangerous
position
in
which
he
be
place
;
that
when
press
and
question
as
to
circumstance
that
may
possibly
be
use
in
his
defence
,
he
always
wander
off
to
account
of
previous
outrage
commit
by
the
press
-
gang
,
or
to
passionate
abuse
of
the
trick
by
which
man
have
be
lure
from
their
home
on
the
night
in
question
to
assist
in
put
out
an
imaginary
fire
,
and
then
seize
and
carry
off
.
<EOS>
some
of
this
very
natural
indignation
may
possibly
have
some
effect
on
the
jury
;
and
this
seem
the
only
ground
of
hope
,
and
be
indeed
a
slight
one
,
as
the
judge
be
likely
to
warn
the
jury
against
allow
their
natural
sympathy
in
such
a
case
to
divert
their
mind
from
the
real
question
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
substance
of
what
Philip
hear
,
and
hear
repeatedly
,
during
his
many
visit
to
Mr.
Dawson
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
time
of
trial
draw
near
;
for
the
York
assize
open
on
March
the
twelfth
;
not
much
above
three
week
since
the
offence
be
commit
which
take
Daniel
from
his
home
and
place
him
in
peril
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
glad
that
,
the
extremity
of
his
danger
never
have
be
hint
to
Bell
,
and
travel
some
forty
mile
be
a
most
unusual
exertion
at
that
time
to
person
of
her
class
,
the
idea
of
go
to
see
her
husband
at
York
have
never
suggest
itself
to
Bell
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Her
increase
feebleness
make
this
seem
a
step
only
to
be
take
in
case
of
the
fatal
extreme
necessity
;
such
be
the
conclusion
that
both
Sylvia
and
he
have
come
to
;
and
it
be
the
knowledge
of
this
that
make
Sylvia
strangle
her
own
daily
longing
to
see
her
father
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
her
hope
be
strong
than
her
fear
.
<EOS>
Philip
never
tell
her
the
cause
for
despondency
;
she
be
young
,
and
she
,
like
her
father
,
could
not
understand
how
fearful
sometimes
be
the
necessity
for
prompt
and
severe
punishment
of
rebellion
against
authority
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
to
be
in
York
during
the
time
of
the
assize
;
and
it
be
understand
,
almost
without
word
,
that
if
the
terrible
worst
occur
,
the
wife
and
daughter
be
to
come
to
York
as
soon
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
for
this
end
Philip
silently
make
all
the
necessary
arrangement
before
leave
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
the
sympathy
of
all
man
be
with
him
;
it
be
too
large
an
occasion
for
Coulson
to
be
anything
<EOS>
but
magnanimous
.
<EOS>
He
urge
Philip
to
take
all
the
time
requisite
;
to
leave
all
business
care
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
Philip
go
about
pale
and
sad
,
there
be
another
cheek
that
grow
paler
still
,
another
eye
that
fill
with
quiet
tear
as
his
heaviness
of
heart
become
more
and
more
apparent
.
<EOS>
the
day
for
open
the
assize
come
on
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
in
York
Minster
,
watch
the
solemn
antique
procession
in
which
the
high
authority
in
the
county
accompany
the
judge
to
the
House
of
the
Lord
,
to
be
there
admonish
as
to
the
nature
of
their
duty
.
<EOS>
as
Philip
listen
to
the
sermon
with
a
strained
and
beat
heart
,
his
hope
rise
higher
than
his
fear
for
the
first
time
,
and
that
evening
he
write
his
first
letter
to
Sylvia
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
SYLVIA
,
  
"
It
will
be
longer
first
than
I
think
for
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
say
Tuesday
in
next
week
.
<EOS>
but
keep
up
your
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
hear
the
sermon
to
-
day
which
be
preach
to
the
judge
;
and
the
clergyman
say
so
much
in
it
about
mercy
and
forgiveness
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
can
not
fail
to
be
lenient
this
assize
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
uncle
,
who
look
but
thin
,
but
be
in
good
heart
:
only
he
will
keep
say
he
would
do
it
over
again
if
he
have
the
chance
,
which
neither
Mr.
Dawson
nor
I
think
be
wise
in
him
,
in
especial
as
the
gaoler
be
by
and
hear
every
word
as
be
say
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
fain
of
hear
all
about
home
;
and
want
you
to
rear
Daisy
's
calf
,
as
he
think
she
will
prove
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
He
bid
me
give
his
good
love
to
you
and
my
aunt
,
and
his
kind
duty
to
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
,
will
you
try
and
forget
how
I
use
to
scold
you
about
your
writing
and
spelling
,
and
just
write
me
two
or
three
line
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
rather
have
them
badly
spelt
than
not
,
because
then
I
shall
be
sure
they
be
yours
.
<EOS>
and
never
mind
about
capital
;
I
be
a
fool
to
say
such
a
deal
about
them
,
for
a
man
do
just
as
well
without
them
.
<EOS>
a
letter
from

would
do
a
vast
to
keep
me
patient
all
these

<EOS>
heavily
the
day
pass
over
.
<EOS>
on
Sunday
Bell
and
Sylvia
go
to
church
,
with
a
strange
,
half
-
superstitious
feeling
,
as
if
they
could
propitiate
the
most
high
to
order
the
event
in
their
favour
by
pay
Him
the
compliment
of
attend
to
duty
in
their
time
of
sorrow
which
they
have
too
often
neglect
in
their
prosperous
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
He
"
who
knoweth
our
frame
,
and
remembereth
that
we
be
dust
,
"
take
pity
upon
His
child
,
and
send
some
of
His
blessed
peace
into
their
heart
,
else
they
could
scarce
have
endure
the
agony
of
suspense
of
those
next
hour
.
<EOS>
for
as
they
come
slowly
and
wearily
home
from
church
,
Sylvia
could
no
longer
bear
her
secret
,
but
tell
her
mother
of
the
peril
in
which
Daniel
stand
.
<EOS>
cold
as
the
March
wind
blow
,
they
have
not
feel
it
,
and
have
sate
down
on
a
hedge
bank
for
Bell
to
rest
.
<EOS>
and
then
Sylvia
speak
,
tremble
and
sick
for
fear
,
yet
utterly
unable
to
keep
silence
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Bell
heave
up
her
hand
,
and
let
them
fall
down
on
her
knee
before
she

"

she

solemnly
.

He
have
send

Sylvia
choke
with
crying

and
lay
her

feel
that

<EOS>
Bell
go
on

stroke
her

ay

I

ta'en
away

in

through
the
valley

up

in
Crosthwaite
Church

<EOS>
I
could
never
guide
th

I
should
be

he
would
take
a

more

I

Bell
shake
her
head

<EOS>
They
walk
on
,
Sylvia
both
dishearten
and
almost
irritated
at
her
mother
's
despondency
.
<EOS>
but
before
they
go
to
bed
at
night
Bell
say
thing
which
seem
as
though
the
morning
's
feeling
have
be
but
temporary
,
and
as
if
she
be
refer
every
decision
to
the
period
of
her
husband
's
return
.
<EOS>
"
when
father
come
home
,
"
seem
a
sort
of
burden
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
every
sentence
,
and
this
reliance
on
his
certain
come
back
to
them
be
almost
as
great
a
trial
to
Sylvia
as
the
absence
of
all
hope
have
be
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
but
that
instinct
tell
her
that
her
mother
be
become
incapable
of
argument
,
she
would
have
ask
her
why
her
view
be
so
essentially
change
in
so
few
hour
.
<EOS>
this
inability
of
reason
in
poor
Bell
make
Sylvia
feel
very
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
pass
over
 
how
,
neither

for
neither

<EOS>
before
it
be
light
on
Tuesday

"
ay

<EOS>
"
say
Bell
,
in
a
brisk
,
cheerful
tone
;
"
but
he
will
,
maybe
,
be
home
to

night

and
i'se

She
hurry
about
in
a
way
which
Sylvia
wonder
to
see
;
till
at
length
she
fancy
that
perhaps
her
mother

so
to
drive
away

<EOS>
every
place
be
clean

there

long
before
mid

day

all
the
work

the
two
sit
down
to
their
spinning

Sylvia
's
spirit
sink
lower
and
low
at
each
speech
of
her
mother

,
from
whose
mind
all
fear
seem
to
have
disappear
,
leave
only
a
strange
restless
kind
of
excitement

<EOS>
"
It
be
time
for
t

Bell
,
after
her
wool
have
snap
many
a
time
from
her
uneven
tread

"
Mother

Sylvia
,
"
it

just
go
ten

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

on

without

noon

"
  
<EOS>
this
seem
to
settle
matter
for
a
while
;
but
then
Bell
push
her
wheel
away
,
and
begin
search
for
her
hood
and
cloak
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
find
them
for
her
,
and
then
ask
sadly
    
"
what
do
ta
want
'em
for

mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
up
t

just
have
a
look
down
t

lane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
wi

thee

say
Sylvia
,
feel
all
the
time
the
uselessness
of
any
look
for
intelligence
from
York
<EOS>
so
early
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
very
patiently
do
she
wait
by
her
mother
's
side
during
the
long
half
-
hour
which
Bell
spend
in
gaze
down
the
road
for
those
who
never
come
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
get
home
Sylvia
put
the
potato
on
to
boil
;
but
when
dinner
be
ready
and
the
three
be
seat
at
the
dresser
,
Bell
push
her
plate
away

from

the

the
peaceful

just
after

she

She

then
she

with
all
his

the
wearied

to

He

Sylvia

slowly

stand
still

It
be
the
afternoon
of
an
April
day
in
that

year

and
the
sky
be
blue
above
,
with
little
sailing
white

the
pleasant
sunlight
.
<EOS>
the
earth
in
that
northern

the

near

from

moor
and
the
high

<EOS>
the
air
be
full
of
pleasant
sound
prophesy
of
the
come
summer
.
<EOS>
the
rush
,
and
murmur
,
and
tinkle
of
the
hide
watercourse
;
the
song
of
the
lark
poise
high
up
in
the
sunny
air
;
the
bleat
of
the
lamb
call
to
their

full
of
hope
and
gladness
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
for
a
mournful
month
the
front
door
of
Haytersbank
Farm
be
open
;
the
warm
spring
air
may
enter
,
and
displace
the
sad
dark
gloom
,
if
it
could
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
newly
-
light
fire
in
the
unused
grate
;
and
Kester
be
in
the
kitchen
,
with
his
clog
off
his
foot
,
so
as
not
to
dirty
the
spotless
floor
,
stir
here
and
there
,
and
try
in
his
awkward
way
to
make
thing
look
home
-
like
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
He
have
bring
in
some
wild
daffodil
which
he
have
be
to
seek
in
the
dawn
,
and
he
place
them
in
a
jug
on
the
dresser
.
<EOS>
Dolly

,
the
woman
who
have
come

help
Sylvia
during
her
mother
's
illness
a
year
ago
,
be
attend
to
something
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
make
a
noise
among
the
milk
-
can
,
and
singe
a
ballad
to
herself
as
she
work
;
yet
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
check
herself
in
her
singing
,
as
if
a
sudden
recollection
come
upon
her
that
this
be
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
for
song
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
she
take
up
the
funeral
psalm
which
be
sing
by
the
bearer
of
the
body
in
that
country
    
Our
God
,
our
help
in
age
past
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
no
use
:
<EOS>
the
pleasant
April
weather
out
of
door
,
and
perhaps
the
natural
spring
in
the
body
,
dispose
her
nature
to
cheerfulness
,
and
insensibly
she
return
to
her
old
ditty
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
be
turn
over
many
thing
in
his
rude
honest
mind
as
he
stand
there
,
give
his
finish
touch
every
now
and
then
to
the
aspect
of
the
house
-
place
,
in
preparation
for
the
return
of
the
widow
and
daughter
of
his
old
master
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
month
and
more
since
they
have
leave
home
;
more
than
a
fortnight
since
Kester
,
with
three
halfpence
in
his
pocket
,
have
set
out
after
his
day
's
work
to
go
to
York
 
to
walk
all
night
long
,
and
to
wish
Daniel
Robson
his
last
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
have
try
to
keep
up
and
have
bring
out
one
or
two
familiar
,
thread
-
bare
,
well
-
wear
joke
,
such
as
he
have
make
Kester
chuckle
over
many
a
time
and
oft
,
when
the
two
have
be
together
afield
or
in
the
shippen
at
the
home
which
he
should
never
more
see
.
<EOS>
but
no
"
Old
Grouse
in
the
gunroom
"
could
make
Kester
smile
,
or
do
anything
except
groan
in
but
a
heart
-
break
sort
of
fashion
,
and
presently
the
talk
have
become
more
suitable
to
the
occasion
,
Daniel
be
up
to
the
last
the
more
composed
of
the
two
;
for
Kester
,
when
turn
out
of
the
condemn
cell
,
fairly
break
down
into
the
heavy
sobbing
he
have
never
think
to
sob
again
on
earth
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
Bell
and
Sylvia
in
their
lodging
at
York
,
under
Philip
's
care
;
he
dare
not
go
to
see
them
;
he
could
not
trust
himself
;
he
have
send
them
his
duty
,
and
bade
Philip
tell
Sylvia
that
the
game
-
hen
have
bring
out
fifteen
chicken
at
a
hatch
.
  
<EOS>
yet
although
Kester
send
this
message
through
Philip
 
although
he
see
and
recognize
all
that
Philip
be
do
in
their
behalf
,
in
the
behalf
of
Daniel
Robson
,
the
condemn
felon
,
his
honoured
master
 
<EOS>
he
like
Hepburn
not
a
whit
better
than
he
have
do
before
all
this
sorrow
<EOS>
have
come
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
,
perhaps
,
show
a
want
of
tact
in
his
conduct
to
Kester
.
<EOS>
acute
with
passionate
keenness
in
one
direction
,
he
have
a
sort
of
dull
straightforwardness
in
all
other
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
he
have
return
Kester
the
money
which
the
latter
have
so
gladly
advanced
towards
the
expense
incur
in
defend
Daniel
.
<EOS>
now
the
money
which
Philip
give
him
back
be
part
of
an
advance
which
Foster
Brothers
have
make
on
Philip
's
own
account
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
think
that
it
be
hard
on
Kester
to
lose
his
saving
in
a
hopeless
cause
,
and
have
make
a
point
of
repay
the
old
man
;
but
Kester
would
far
rather
have
feel
that
the
earning
of
the
sweat
of
his
brow
have
go
in
the
attempt
to
save
his
master
's
life
than
have
have
twice
ten
time
as
many
golden
guinea
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
seem
to
take
his
action
in
lend
his
hoard
out
of
the
sphere
of
love
,
and
make
it
but
a
leaden
common
loan
,
when
it
be
Philip
who
bring
him
the
sum
,
not
Sylvia
,
into
whose
hand
he
have
give
it
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
feeling
Kester
feel
his
heart
shut
up
as
he
see
the
long
-
watch
-
for
two
come
down
the
little
path
with
a
third
person
;
with
Philip
hold
up
the
fail
step
of
poor
Bell
Robson
,
as
,
load
with
her
heavy
mourning
,
and
feeble
from
the
illness
which
have
detain
her
in
York
ever
since
the
day
of
her
husband
's
execution
,
she
come
falter
back
to
her
desolate
home
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
also
occupy
in
attend
to
her
mother
;
one
or
twice
,
when
they
pause
a
little
,
she
and
Philip
speak
,
in
the
familiar
way
in
which
there
be
no
coyness
nor
reserve
.
<EOS>
Kester
catch
up
his
clog
,
and
go
quickly
out
through
the
back
-
kitchen
into
the
farm
-
yard
,
not
stay
to
greet
them
,
as
he
have
mean
to
do
;
and
yet
it
be
dull
-
sighted
of
him
not
to
have
perceive
that
whatever
may
be
the
relation
between
Philip
and
Sylvia
,
he
be
sure
to
have
accompany
them
home
;
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
be
the
only
male
protector
of
their
blood
remain
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Poor
Kester
,
who
would
fain
have
take
that
office
upon
himself
,
choose
to
esteem
himself
cast
off
,
and
go
heavily
about
the
farmyard
,
know
that
he
ought
to
go
in
and
bid
such
poor
welcome
as
he
have
to
offer
,
yet
feel
too
much
to
like
to
show
himself
before
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
long
,
too
,
before
any
one
have
leisure
to
come
and
seek
him
.
<EOS>
Bell
's
mind
have
flash
up
for
a
time
,
till
the
fatal
day
,
only
to
be
reduce
by
her
subsequent
illness
into
complete
and
hopeless
childishness
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
Philip
and
Sylvia
could
do
to
manage
her
in
the
first
excitement
of
return
home
;
her
restless
inquiry
for
him
who
would
never
more
be
present
in
the
familiar
scene
,
her
feverish
weariness
and
uneasiness
,
all
require
tender
soothing
and
most
patient
endurance
of
her
refusal
to
be
satisfied
with
what
they
say
or
do
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
she
take
some
food
,
and
,
refresh
by
it
,
and
warm
by
the
fire
,
she
sink
asleep
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
then
Philip
would
fain
have
speak
with
Sylvia
before
the
hour
come
at
which
he
must
return
to
Monkshaven
,
but
she
elude
him
,
and
go
in
search
of
Kester
,
whose
presence
she
have
miss
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
guess
some
of
the
cause
which
keep
him
from
greet
them
on
their
first
return
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
as
if
she
have
shape
these
cause
into
the
definite
form
of
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
to
look
back
and
find
how
differently
constitute
be
the
mind
of
most
people
fifty
or
sixty
year
ago
<EOS>
;
they
feel
,
they
understand
,
without
go
through
reasoning
or
analytic
process
,
and
if
this
be
the
case
among
the
more
educated
people
,
of
course
it
be
still
more
so
in
the
class
to
which
Sylvia
belong
.
<EOS>
She
know
by
some
sort
of
intuition
that
if
Philip
accompany
them
home
(
as
,
indeed
,
under
the
circumstance
,
be
so
natural
as
to
be
almost
unavoidable
)
,
the
old
servant
and
friend
of
the
family
would
absent
himself
;
and
so
she
slip
away
at
the
first
possible
moment
to
go
in
search
of
him
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
in
the
farm
-
yard
,
lean
over
the
gate
that
open
into
the
home
-
field
,
apparently
watch
the
poultry
that
scratch
and
peck
at
the
new
-
spring
grass
with
the
utmost
relish
.
<EOS>
a
little
farther
off
be
the
ewes
with
their
new
-
drop
lamb
,
beyond
that
the
great
old
thorn
-
tree
with
its
round
fresh
cluster
of
bud
,
again
beyond
that
there
be
a
glimpse
of
the
vast
sunny
ripple
sea
;
but
Sylvia
know
well
that
Kester
be
look
at
none
of
these
thing
.
<EOS>
She
go
up
to
him
and
touch
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
start
from
his
reverie
,
and
turn
round
upon
her
with
his
dim
eye
full
of
unshed
tear
.
<EOS>
when
he
see
her
black
dress
,
her
deep
mourning
,
he
have
hard
work
to
keep
from
break
out
,
but
by
dint
of
a
good
brush
of
his
eye
with
the
back
of
his
hand
,
and
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
could
look
at
her
again
with
tolerable
calmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Kester
:
why
didst
niver
come
to
speak
to
us
?
"
say
Sylvia
,
find
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful
if
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
dun

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
day
after
day
there
be
this
constant
reference
to
her
dead
husband
.
<EOS>
in
one
sense
it
be
a
blessing
;
all
the
circumstance
attendant
on
his
sad
and
untimely
end
be
sweep
out
of
her
mind
along
with
the
recollection
of
the
fact
itself
.
<EOS>
She
refer
to
him
as
absent
,
and
have
always
some
plausible
way
of
account
for
it
,
which
satisfy
her
own
mind
;
and
,
accordingly
they
fall
into
the
habit
of
humour
her
,
and
speak
of
him
as
go
to
Monkshaven
,
or
afield
,
or
weary
out
,
and
take
a
nap
upstairs
,
as
her
fancy
lead
her
to
believe
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
but
this
forgetfulness
,
though
happy
for
herself
,
be
terrible
for
her
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
constant
renewing
of
Sylvia
's
grief
,
while
her
mother
could
give
her
no
sympathy
,
no
help
,
or
strength
in
any
circumstance
that
arise
out
of
this
grief
.
<EOS>
She
be
drive
more
and
more
upon
Philip
;
his
advice
and
his
affection
become
daily
more
necessary
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
see
what
would
be
the
end
of
all
this
more
clearly
than
Sylvia
do
herself
;
and
,
impotent
to
hinder
what
he
fear
and
dislike
,
he
grow
more
and
more
surly
every
day
.
<EOS>
yet
he
try
to
labour
hard
and
well
for
the
interest
of
the
family
,
as
if
they
be
bind
up
in
his
good
management
of
the
cattle
and
land
.
<EOS>
He
be
out
and
about
by
the
early
dawn
,
work
all
day
long
with
might
and
main
.
<EOS>
He
buy
himself
a
pair
of
new
spectacle
,
which
may
,
he
fancy
,
enable
him
to
read
the
_
Farmer
's
Complete
Guide
_
,
his
dead
master
's
_
vade
-
mecum
_
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
never
learn
more
than
his
capital
letter
,
and
have
forget
many
of
them
;
so
the
spectacle
do
him
but
little
good
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
take
the
book
to
Sylvia
,
and
ask
her
to
read
to
him
the
instruction
he
need
;
<EOS>
instruction
,
be
it
note
,
that
he
would
formerly
have
despise
as
mere
book
-
learning
:
but
his
present
sense
of
responsibility
have
make
him
humble
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
would
find
the
place
with
all
deliberation
:
and
put
her
finger
under
the
line
to
keep
the
exact
place
of
the
word
she
be
read
,
she
would
strive
in
good
earnest
to
read
out
the
direction
give
;
but
when
every
fourth
word
have
to
be
spelt
,
it
be
rather
hopeless
work
,
especially
as
all
these
word
be
unintelligible
to
the
open
-
mouthed
listener
,
however
intent
he
may
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
generally
to
fall
back
on
his
own
experience
;
and
,
guide
by
that
,
thing
be
not
do
badly
in
his
estimation
,
when
,
one
day
,
Sylvia
say
to
him
,
as
they
be
in

heap
up
the

him
,
and
not
let
go
his
hold
till
one
or
the
other
be
dead
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
catch
some
of
the
passionate
meaning
of
the
gloomy
,
miserable
tone
of
Philip
's
voice
as
he
say
these
word
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
yo
'
know
that
I
care
a
deal
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
plead
and
innocent
in
her
pale
,
troubled
face
,
so
pathetic
in
her
tone
,
that
Philip
's
anger
,
which
have
be
excite
against
her
,
as
well
as
against
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
melt
away
into
love
;
and
once
more
he
feel
that
have
her
for
his
own
<EOS>
he
must
,
at
any
cost
.
<EOS>
He
sate
down
by
her
,
and
speak
to
her
in
quite
a
different
manner
to
that
which
he
have
use
before
,
with
a
ready
tact
and
art
which
some
strange
instinct
or
tempter
"
close
at
his
ear
"
supply
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
darling
,
I
know
yo
'
care
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
ill
of
him
that
be
 
<EOS>
dead
 
ay
,
dead
and
drown
 
whativer
<EOS>
Kester
may
say
 
before
now
;
but
if
I
choose
I
could
tell
tale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
tell
no
tale
;
I
will
not
hear
them
,
"
say
she
,
wrench
herself
out
of
Philip
's
clasp
arm
.
<EOS>
"
They
may
misca
'
him
for
iver
,
and
I
will
not
believe
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
niver
miscall
one
who
be
dead
,
"
say
Philip
;
each
new
unconscious
sign
of
the
strength
of
Sylvia
's
love
for
her
former
lover
only
make
him
the
more
anxious
to
convince
her
that
he
be
dead
,
only
render
him
more
keen
at
deceive
his
own
conscience
by
repeat
to
it
the
lie
that
long
ere
this
Kinraid
be
in
all
probability
dead
 
kill
by
either
the
chance
of
war
or
tempestuous
sea
;
that
,
even
if
not
,
he
be
as
good
as
dead
to
her
;
so
that
the
word
"
dead
"
may
be
use
in
all
honest
certainty
,
as
in
one
of
its
meaning
Kinraid
be
dead
for
sure
.
  
<EOS>
"
think
yo
'
that
if
he
be
not
dead
he
would
not
ha
'
write
ere
this
to
some
one
of
his
kin
,
if
not
to
thee
?
<EOS>
yet
none
of
his
folk
Newcassel
-
way
but
believe
him
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
Kester
say
,
"
sigh
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
take
heart
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
softly
round
her
again
,
and
murmur
    
"
My
lassie
,
try
not
to
think
on
them
as
be
go
,
as
be
dead
,
but
t
'
think
a
bit
more
on
him
as
love
yo
'
wi
'
heart
,
and
soul
,
and
may
,
and
have
do
iver
sin
'
<EOS>
he
first
set
eye
on
yo
'
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Sylvie
,
my
love
for
thee
be
just
terrible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Dolly
Reid
be
see
at
the
back
-
door
of
the
farmhouse
,
and
catch
sight
of
Sylvia
,
she
call
out
    
"
Sylvia
,
thy
mother
be
axe
for
thee
,
and
I
can
not
make
her
mind
easy
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
Sylvia
have
spring
up
from
her
seat
,
and
be
run
in
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
mother
's
troubled
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
sate
on
by
the
well
-
side
,
his
face
bury
in
his
two
hand
.
<EOS>
presently
he
lift
himself
up
,
drank
some
water
eagerly
out
of
his
hollowed
palm
,
sigh
,
and
shake
himself
,
and
follow
his
cousin
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
come
unexpectedly
to
the
limit
of
his
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
in
general
she
obey
his
express
wish
with
gentle
indifference
,
as
if
she
have
no
preference
of
her
own
;
once
or
twice
he
find
that
she
be
do
what
he
desire
out
of
the
spirit
of
obedience
,
which
,
as
her
mother
's
daughter
,
she
believe
to
be
her
duty
towards
her
affianced
husband
.
<EOS>
and
this
last
motive
for
action
depress
her
lover
more
than
anything
.
<EOS>
He
want
the
old
Sylvia
back
again
;
captious
,
capricious
,
wilful
,
haughty
,
merry
,
charming
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
that
Sylvia
be
go
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
but
once
especially
his
power
,
arise
from
whatever
cause
,
be
stop
entirely
short
 
<EOS>
be
utterly
of
no
avail
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
occasion
of
Dick
Simpson
's
mortal
illness
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
keep
aloof
from
every
one
.
<EOS>
They
have
never
be
intimate
with
any
family
but
the
Corneys
,
and
even
this
friendship
have
considerably
cool
since
Molly
's
marriage
,
and
most
especially
since
Kinraid
's
suppose
death
,
when
Bessy
Corney
and
Sylvia
have
be
,
as
it
be
,
rival
mourner
.
<EOS>
but
many
people
,
both
in
Monkshaven
and
the
country
round
about
,
hold
the
Robson
family
in
great
respect
,
although
Mrs.
Robson
herself
be
account
"
high
"
and
"
distant
;
"
and
poor
little
Sylvia
,
in
her
heyday
of
beautiful
youth
and
high
spirit
,
have
be
speak
of
as
'
a
bit
flighty
,
"
and
'
a
set
-
up
lassie
.
"
<EOS>
still
,
when
their
great
sorrow
fall
upon
them
,
there
be
plenty
of
friend
to
sympathize
deeply
with
them
;
and
,
as
Daniel
have
suffer
in
a
popular
cause
,
there
be
even
more
who
,
scarcely
know
them
personally
,
be
ready
to
give
them
all
the
mark
of
respect
and
friendly
feeling
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
but
neither
Bell
nor
Sylvia
be
aware
of
this
.
<EOS>
the
former
have
lose
all
perception
of
what
be
not
immediately
before
her
;
the
latter
shrink
from
all
encounter
of
any
kind
with
a
sore
heart
,
and
sensitive
avoidance
of
everything
that
could
make
her
a
subject
of
remark
.
<EOS>
so
the
poor
afflict
people
at
Haytersbank
know
little
of
Monkshaven
news
.
<EOS>
what
little
do
come
to
their
ear
come
through
Dolly
Reid
,
when
she
return
from
sell
the
farm
produce
of
the
week
;
and
often
,
indeed
,
even
then
she
find
Sylvia
too
much
absorb
in
other
care
or
thought
to
listen
to
her
gossip
.
<EOS>
so
no
one
have
ever
name
that
Simpson
be
suppose
to
be
die
till
Philip
begin
on
the
subject
one
evening
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
face
suddenly
flash
into
glow
and
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
die
,
be
he
?
<EOS>
t
'
earth
be
well
rid
on
such
a
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
eh
,
Sylvie
,
that
be
a
hard
speech
o
'
thine
!
"
<EOS>
say
Philip
;
<EOS>
"
it
give
me
but
poor
heart
to
ask
a
favour
of
thee
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
aught
about
Simpson
,
"
reply
she
,
and
then
she
interrupt
herself
.
"
<EOS>
but
say
on
;
it
be
ill
-
mannered
in
me
for
t
'
interrupt
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
would
be
sorry
to
see
him
,
I
think
,
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
get
over
the
way
,
t

folk
meet
him
,
and
pelt
him
when
he
come
back
<EOS>
fra

York
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
weak
and
faint
,
and
beside
himself
at
time
;
and
he
will
lie
a
dreaming
,
and
a

fancy
they
be
all
at
him
again
,
hoot
,
and
yelling
,
and

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
on

Sylvia

"
it

if

some

even
i

have
go

on
about

so
that
his

<EOS>
his

fatherless
for

I
wonder
if
thy
vein
would
run
milk
and
water
,
so
that
thou
could
go
and
make
friend

and
speak
soft
wi

cause
thy

's
death

<EOS>

It
be
say
in
t

Bible

Sylvie

that
we
be
to

there

yo

<EOS>
Philip
be
silent
,
think
what
more
he
could
urge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'd
better
be
off

say
Sylvia
,
in
a
minute
or
two

<EOS>
"

Yo

Yo've
say
all
yo

for

and
perhaps
it
be
not
yo

as
be
to
blame
,
but
<EOS>
yo'r
nature
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
put
out
wi
'
thee
,
and
want
thee
out
o
'
my
sight
for
awhile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
one
or
two
more
speech
of
this
kind
convince
him
that
it
would
be
wise
in
him
to
take
her
at
her
word
.
<EOS>
He
go
back
to
Simpson
,
and
find
him
,
though
still
alive
,
past
the
understanding
of
any
word
of
human
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
almost
wish
he
have
not
trouble
or
irritated
Sylvia
by
urge
the
die
man
's
request
:
the
performance
of
this
duty
seem
now
to
have
be
such
a
useless
office
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
performance
of
a
duty
be
never
a
useless
office
,
though
we
may
not
see
the
consequence
,
or
they
may
be
quite
different
to
what
we
expect
or
calculate
on
.
<EOS>
in
the
pause
of
active
work
,
when
daylight
be
do
,
and
the
evening
shade
come
on
,
Sylvia
have
time
to
think
;
and
her
heart
grow
sad
and
soft
,
in
comparison
to
what
it
have
be
when
Philip
's
urgency
have
call
out
all
her
angry
opposition
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
her
father
 
his
sharp
passion
,
his
frequent
forgiveness
,
or
rather
his
forgetfulness
that
he
have
even
be
injure
.
<EOS>
all
Sylvia
's
persistent
or
endure
quality
be
derive
from
her
mother
,
her
impulse
from
her
father
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
dead
father
whose
example
fill
her
mind
this
evening
in
the
soft
and
tender
twilight
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
say
to
herself
that
she
would
go
and
tell
Simpson
that
she
forgive
him
;
but
she
think
that
if
Philip
ask
her
again
that
she
should
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
Philip
again
he
tell
her
that
Simpson
be
dead
;
and
pass
on
from
what
he
have
reason
to
think
would
be
an
unpleasant
subject
to
her
.
<EOS>
thus
he
never
learn
how
her
conduct
may
have
be
more
gentle
and
relent
than
her
word
 
word
which
come
up
into
his
memory
at
a
future
time
,
with
full
measure
of
miserable
significance
.
  
<EOS>
in
general
,
Sylvia
be
gentle
and
good
enough
;
but
Philip
want
her
to
be
shy
and
tender
with
him
,
and
this
she
be
not
.
<EOS>
She
speak
to
him
,
her
pretty
eye
look
straight
and
composedly
at
him
.
<EOS>
She
consult
him
like
the
family
friend
that
he
be
:
she
meet
him
quietly
in
all
the
arrangement
for
the
time
of
their
marriage
,
which
she
look
upon
more
as
a
change
of
home
,
as
the
leaving
of
Haytersbank
,
as
it
would
affect
her
mother
,
than
in
any
more
directly
personal
way
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
begin
to
feel
,
though
not
as
yet
to
acknowledge
,
that
the
fruit
he
have
so
inordinately
long
for
be
but
of
the
nature
of
an
apple
of
Sodom
.
  
<EOS>
long
ago
,
lodge
in
widow
Rose
's
garret
,
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
watch
some
pigeon
that
be
keep
by
a
neighbour
;
the
flock
disport
themselves
on
the
steep
tile
roof
just
opposite
to
the
attic
window
,
and
insensibly
Philip
grow
to
know
their
way
,
and
one
pretty
,
soft
little
dove
be
somehow
perpetually
associate
in
his
mind
with
his
idea
of
his
cousin
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
the
pigeon
would
sit
in
one
particular
place
,
sun
herself
,
and
puff
out
her
feather
breast
,
with
all
the
blue
and
rose
-
colour
light
gleam
in
the
morning
ray
,
coo
softly
to
herself
as
she
dress
her
plumage
.
<EOS>
Philip
fancy
that
he
see
the
same
colour
in
a
certain
piece
of
shot
silk
 
now
in
the
shop
;
and
none
other
seem
to
him
so
suitable
for
his
darling
's
wedding
-
dress
.
<EOS>
He
carry
enough
to
make
a
gown
,
and
give
it
to
her
one
evening
,
as
she
sate
on
the
grass
just
outside
the
house
,
half
attend
to
her
mother
,
half
engage
in
knit
stocking
for
her
scanty
marriage
outfit
.
<EOS>
He
be
glad
that
the
sun
be
not
go
down
,
thus
allow
him
to
display
the
change
colour
in
full
light
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
admire
it
duly
;
even
Mrs.
Robson
be
pleased
and
attract
by
the
soft
yet
brilliant
hue
.
<EOS>
Philip
whisper
to
Sylvia
 
(
he
take
delight
in
whisper
,
 
<EOS>
she
,
on
the
contrary
,
always
speak
to
him
in
her
usual
tone
of
voice
)
    
<EOS>
"
Thou'lt

Yon

sadly

<EOS>
"

I
be
just
sorry

for
I

and
thou'rt
so
kind
and
good
<EOS>
,
I
sometimes
think
I
can
niver

thankful
enough
to
thee

<EOS>
when
I

on
what

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
yo

to
be
grateful

Sylvie
,
"
say
poor
Philip
,
dissatisfy
,
yet
unable
to
explain
what
he
do
want
;
<EOS>
only
know
that
there
be
something
he
lack
,
yet
fain
would
have
have
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
marriage
-
day
draw
near
,
all
Sylvia
's
care
seem
to
be
for
her
mother
;
all
her
anxiety
be
regard
the
appurtenance
of
the
home
she
be
leave
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Philip
try
to
interest
her
in
detail
of
his
improvement
or
contrivance
in
the
new
home
to
which
he
be
go
to
take
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
tell
him
;
but
the
idea
of
the
house
behind
the
shop
be
associate
in
her
mind
with
two
time
of
discomfort
and
misery
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
she
have
go
into
the
parlour
about
which
Philip
speak
so
much
be
at
the
time
of
the
press
-
gang
riot
,
when
she
have
faint
from
terror
and
excitement
;
the
second
be
on
that
night
of
misery
when
she
and
her
mother
have
go
in
to
Monkshaven
,
to
bid
her
father
farewell
before
he
be
take
to
York
;
in
that
room
,
on
that
night
,
she
have
first
learn
something
of
the
fatal
peril
in
which
he
stand
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
show
the
bright
shy
curiosity
about
her
future
dwelling
that
be
common
enough
with
girl
who
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
all
she
could
do
be
to
restrain
herself
from
sigh
,
and
listen
patiently
,
when
he
talk
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
in
time
he
see
that
she
shrink
from
it
;
so
he
hold
his
peace
,
and
plan
and
work
for
her
in
silence
,
 
smile
to
himself
as
he
look
on
each
complete
arrangement
for
her
pleasure
or
comfort
;
and
know
well
that
her
happiness
be
involve
in
what
fragment
of
peace
and
material
comfort
may
remain
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
the
wedding
-
day
draw
near
apace
.
<EOS>
It
be
Philip
's
plan
that
after
they
have
be
marry
in
Kirk
Moorside
church
,
he
and
his
Sylvia
,
his
cousin
,
his
love
,
his
wife
,
should
go
for
the
day
to
Robin
Hood
's
Bay
,
return
in
the
evening
to
the
house
behind
the
shop
in
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
there
they
be
to
find
Bell
Robson
instal
in
her
future
home
;
for
Haytersbank
Farm
be
to
be
give
up
to
the
new
tenant
on
the
very
day
of
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
would
not
be
marry
any
sooner
;
she
say
that
she
must
stay
there
till
the
very
last
;
and
have
say
it
with
such
determination
that
Philip
have
desist
from
all
urgency
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
that
all
should
be
settle
for
her
mother
's
comfort
during
their
few
hour
'
absence
;
otherwise
Sylvia
would
not
have
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
he
should
ask
Hester
,
who
be
always
so
good
and
kind
 
who
never
yet
have
say
him
nay
,
to
go
to
church
with
them
as
bridesmaid
 
for
Sylvia
would
give
no
thought
or
care
to
anything
but
her
mother
 
and
that
they
would
leave
her
at
Haytersbank
as
they
return
from
church
;
she
would
manage
Mrs
Robson
's
removal
 
<EOS>
she
would
do
this
 
<EOS>
do
that
 
do
everything
.
<EOS>
such
friendly
confidence
have
Philip
in
Hester
's
willingness
and
tender
skill
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
acquiesce
at
length
,
and
Philip
take
upon
himself
to
speak
to
Hester
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hester
,
"
say
he
,
one
day
when
he
be
prepare
to
go
home
after
the
shop
be
close
;
"
would
yo
'
mind
stop
a
bit
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
show
yo
'
the
place
<EOS>
now
it
be
do
up
;
and
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
on
yo
'
besides
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
so
happy
he
do
not
see
her
shiver
all
over
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
just
a
moment
before
she
answer
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
,
if
thou
wish
it
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
no
judge
o
'
fashion
and
such
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
a
judge
o
'
comfort
,
and
that
be
what
I
have
be
aim
at
.
<EOS>
I
be
niver
so
comfortable
in
a
'
my
life
as
when
I
be
a
lodger
at
thy
house
,
"
say
he
,
with
brotherly
tenderness
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"
if
my
mind
have
be
at
ease
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
say
I
niver
be
happy
in
all
my
day
than
under
thy
roof
;
and
I
know
it
be
thy
do
for
the
most
part
.
<EOS>
so
come
along
,
Hester
,
and
tell
me
if
there
be
aught
more
I
can
put
in
for
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
not
have
be
a
very
appropriate
text
,
but
such
as
it
be
the
word
,
"
from
him
that
would
ask
of
thee
turn
not
thou
away
,
"
seem
the
only
source
of
strength
that
could
have
enable
her
to
go
patiently
through
the
next
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
unselfishly
bring
all
her
mind
to
bear
upon
the
subject
;
admire
this
,
think
and
decide
upon
that
,
<EOS>
as
one
by
one
Philip
show
her
all
his
alteration
and
improvement
.
<EOS>
never
be
such
a
quiet
little
bit
of
unconscious
and
unrecognized
heroism
.
<EOS>
She
really
end
by
such
a
conquest
of
self
that
she
could
absolutely
sympathize
with
the
proud
expectant
lover
,
and
have
quench
all
envy
of
the
beloved
,
in
sympathy
with
the
delight
she
imagine
Sylvia
must
experience
when
she
discover
all
these
proof
of
Philip
's
fond
consideration
and
care
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
great
strain
on
the
heart
,
that
source
of
life
;
and
when
Hester
return
into
the
parlour
,
after
her
deliberate
survey
of
the
house
,
she
feel
as
weary
and
depressed
in
bodily
strength
as
if
she
have
go
through
an
illness
of
many
day
.
<EOS>
She
sate
down
on
the
near
chair
,
and
feel
as
though
she
never
could
rise
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
joyous
and
content
,
stand
near
her
talking
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
Hester
,
"
say
he
,
"
Sylvie
have
give
me
a
message
for
thee
 
<EOS>
she
say
thou
must
be
<EOS>
her
bridesmaid
 
<EOS>
she
will
have
none
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
say
Hester
,
with
sudden
sharpness
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
but
yo
'
must
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
like
my
wedding
if
thou
be
not
there
:
why
I
have
look
upon
thee
as
a
sister
iver
since
I
come
to
lodge
with
thy
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
do
her
duty
require
her
not
to
turn
away
from
this
asking
,
too
?
<EOS>
Philip
see
her
reluctance
,
and
,
by
intuition
rather
than
reason
,
he
know
that
what
she
would
not
do
for
gaiety
or
pleasure
she
would
consent
to
,
if
by
so
do
she
could
render
any
service
to
another
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
,
Sylvie
and
me
have
plan
to
go
for
our
wedding
jaunt

Robin
Hood

I

<EOS>
th

poor
old
body
be
sore
crush
with
sorrow
;
and
be
,
as
one
may
say
,
childish
at
time
;
she
be
to
come
down
here
,
that
we
may
find
her
when
we
come
back
at
night

and
there

so
willing

so
happy

Sylvie

me
have
both

so

<EOS>
Hester
look
up
in
his
face
with
her
grave
honest
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
go
to
church
wi
'
thee
,
Philip

and
thou
must
not
ask
me
any
further

<EOS>
but
I
will
go
betime
to
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
I
will
do
my
good
to
make
the
old
lady
happy
,
and
to
follow
out
thy
direction
in
bring
her
here
before
nightfall

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
on
the
point
of
urge
her
afresh
to
go
with
them
to
church
;
but
something
in
her
eye
bring
a
thought
across
his
mind
,
as
transitory
as
a
breath
pass
over
a
looking
-
glass
,
and
he
desist
from
his
entreaty
,
and
put
away
his
thought
as
a
piece
of
vain
coxcombry
,
insult
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
He
pass
rapidly
on
to
all
the
careful
direction
render
necessary
by
her
compliance
with
the
latter
part
of
his
request
,
couple
Sylvia
's
name
with
his
perpetually
;
so
that
Hester
look
upon
her
as
a
happy
girl
,
as
eager
in
plan
all
the
detail
of
her
marriage
as
though
no
heavy
shameful
sorrow
have
pass
over
her
head
not
many
month
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
do
not
see
Sylvia
's
white
,
dreamy
,
resolute
face
,
that
answer
the
solemn
question
of
the
marriage
service
in
a
voice
that
do
not
seem
her
own
.
<EOS>
Hester
be
not
with
them
to
notice
the
heavy
abstraction
that
make
the
bride
as
if
unconscious
of
her
husband
's
loving
word
,
and
then
start
and
smile
,
and
reply
with
a
sad
gentleness
of
tone
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
Hester
's
duty
lie
in
convey
the
poor
widow
and
mother
down
from
Haytersbank
to
the
new
home
in
Monkshaven
;
and
for
all
Hester
's
assistance
and
thoughtfulness
,
it
be
a
dreary
,
painful
piece
of
work
 
<EOS>
the
poor
old
woman
cry
like
a
child
,
with
bewilderment
at
the
confused
bustle
which
,
in
spite
of
all
Sylvia
's
careful
forethought
,
could
not
be
avoid
on
this
final
day
,
when
her
mother
have
to
be
carry
away
from
the
homestead
over
which
she
have
so
long
preside
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
as
nothing
to
the
distress
which
overwhelm
poor
Bell
Robson
when
she
enter
Philip
's
house
;
the
parlour
 
<EOS>
the
whole
place
so
associated
with
the
keen
agony
she
have
undergo
there
,
that
the
stab
of
memory
penetrate
through
her
deadened
sense
,
and
bring
her
back
to
misery
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Hester
try
to
console
her
by
tell
her
the
fact
of
Sylvia
's
marriage
with
Philip
in
every
form
of
word
that
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
Bell
only
remember
her
husband
's
fate
,
which
fill
up
her
poor
wander
mind
,
and
colour
everything
;
insomuch
that
Sylvia
not
be
at
hand
to
reply
to
her
mother
's
cry
for
her
<EOS>
,
the
latter
imagine
that
her
child
,
as
well
as
her
husband
,
be
in
danger
of
trial
and
death
,
and
refuse
to
be
comfort
by
any
endeavour
of
the
patient
sympathize
Hester
.
<EOS>
in
a
pause
of
Mrs
Robson
's
sobs
,
Hester
hear
the
welcome
sound
of
the
wheel
of
the
return
shandry
,
bear
the
bride
and
bridegroom
home
.
<EOS>
It
stop
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
an
instant
,
and
Sylvia
,
white
as
a
sheet
at
the
sound
of
her
mother
's
wailing
,
which
she
have
catch
while
yet
at
a
distance
,
with
the
quick
ear
of
love
,
come
run
in
;
her
mother
feebly
rise
and
totter
towards
her
,
and
fall
into
her
arm
,
say
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
,
take
me
home
,
and
away
from
this
cruel
place
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
could
not
but
be
touch
with
the
young
girl
's
manner
to
her
mother
 
as
tender
,
as
protect
as
if
their
relation
to
each
other
have
be
reverse
,
and
she
be
lull
and
tenderly
soothe
a
wayward
,
frightened
child
.
<EOS>
She
have
neither
eye
nor
ear
for
any
one
till
her
mother
be
sit
in
tremble
peace
,
hold
her
daughter
's
hand
tight
in
both
of
her
,
as
if
afraid
of
lose
sight
of
her
:
then
Sylvia
turn
to
Hester
,
and
,
with
the
sweet
grace
which
be
a
natural
gift
to
some
happy
people
,
thank
her
;
in
common
word
enough
she
thank
her
,
but
in
that
nameless
manner
,
and
with
that
strange
,
rare
charm
which
make
Hester
feel
as
if
she
have
never
be
thank
in
all
her
life
before
;
and
from
that
time
forth
she
understand
,
if
she
do
not
always
yield
to
,
the
unconscious
fascination
which
Sylvia
could
exercise
over
other
at
time
.
  
<EOS>
do
it
enter
into
Philip
's
heart
to
perceive
that
he
have
wed
his
long
-
seek
bride
in
mourn
raiment
,
and
that
the
first
sound
which
greet
them
as
they
approach
their
home
be
those
of
weep
and
wailing
?
      
<EOS>
HAPPY
DAYS
  
<EOS>
and
now
Philip
seem
as
prosperous
as
his
heart
could
desire
.
<EOS>
the
business
flourish
,
and
money
beyond
his
moderate
want
come
in
.
<EOS>
as
for
himself
he
require
very
little
;
but
he
have
always
look
forward
to
place
his
idol
in
a
befitting
shrine
;
and
mean
for
this
be
now
furnish
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
dress
,
the
comfort
,
the
position
he
have
desire
for
Sylvia
be
all
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
need
to
do
a
stroke
of
household
work
if
she
prefer
to
"
sit
in
her
parlour
and
sew
up
a
seam
"
.
<EOS>
indeed
Phoebe
resent
any
interference
in
the
domestic
labour
,
which
she
have
perform
so
long
,
that
she
look
upon
the
kitchen
as
a
private
empire
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Hepburn
"
(
as
Sylvia
be
now
term
)
have
a
good
dark
silk
gown
-
piece
in
her
drawer
,
as
well
as
the
poor
dove
-
colour
,
against
the
day
when
she
choose
to
leave
off
mourning
;
and
stuff
for
either
gray
or
scarlet
cloak
be
her
at
her
bidding
.
  
<EOS>
what
she
care
for
far
more
be
the
comfort
with
which
it
be
in
her
power
to
surround
her
mother
.
<EOS>
in
this
Philip
vie
with
her
;
for
besides
his
old
love
,
and
new
pity
for
his
aunt
Bell
,
he
never
forget
how
she
have
welcome
him
to
Haytersbank
,
and
favour
his
love
to
Sylvia
,
in
the
yearning
day
when
he
little
hope
he
should
ever
win
his
cousin
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
but
even
if
he
have
not
have
these
grateful
and
affectionate
feeling
towards
the
poor
woman
,
he
would
have
do
much
for
her
if
only
to
gain
the
sweet
,
rare
smile
which
his
wife
never
bestow
upon
him
so
freely
as
when
she
see
him
attend
to
"
mother
,
"
for
so
both
of
them
now
call
Bell
.
<EOS>
for
her
creature
comfort
,
her
silk
gown
,
and
her
humble
luxury
,
Sylvia
do
not
care
;
Philip
be
almost
annoy
at
the
indifference
she
often
manifest
to
all
his
effort
to
surround
her
with
such
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
even
a
hardship
to
her
to
leave
off
her
country
dress
,
her
uncovered
hair
,
her
linsey
petticoat
,
and
loose
bed
-
gown
,
and
to
don
a
stiff
and
stately
gown
for
her
morning
dress
.
<EOS>
sit
in
the
dark
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
and
do
"
white
work
,
"
be
much
more
wearying
to
her
than
run
out
into
the
field
to
bring
up
the
cow
,
or
spin
wool
,
or
make
up
butter
.
<EOS>
She
sometimes
think
to
herself
that
it
be
a
strange
kind
of
life
where
there
be
no
out
-
door
animal
to
look
after
;
the
"
ox
and
the
ass
"
have
hitherto
come
into
all
her
idea
of
humanity
;
and
her
care
and
gentleness
have
make
the
dumb
creature
round
her
father
's
home
into
mute
friend
with
love
eye
,
look
at
her
as
if
wistful
to
speak
in
word
the
grateful
regard
that
she
could
read
without
the
poor
expression
of
language
.
  
<EOS>
She
miss
the
free
open
air
,
the
great
dome
of
sky
above
the
field
;
she
rebel
against
the
necessity
of
"
dress
"
(
as
she
call
it
)
to
go
out
,
although
she
acknowledge
that
it
be
a
necessity
where
the
first
step
beyond
the
threshold
must
be
into
a
populous
street
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
Philip
be
right
at
one
time
when
he
have
think
to
win
her
by
material
advantage
;
but
the
old
vanity
have
be
burn
out
of
her
by
the
hot
iron
of
acute
suffering
.
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
passionate
feeling
still
exist
,
conceal
and
latent
;
but
at
this
period
it
appear
as
though
she
be
indifferent
to
most
thing
,
and
have
lose
the
power
of
either
hope
or
fear
much
.
<EOS>
She
be
stun
into
a
sort
of
temporary
numbness
on
most
point
;
those
on
which
she
be
sensitive
be
such
as
refer
to
the
injustice
and
oppression
of
her
father
's
death
,
or
anything
that
concern
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
quiet
even
to
passiveness
in
all
her
dealing
with
Philip
;
he
would
have
give
not
a
little
for
some
of
the
old
burst
of
impatience
,
the
old
pettishness
,
which
,
naughty
as
they
be
,
have
go
to
form
his
idea
of
the
former
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
be
almost
vexed
with
her
for
her
docility
;
he
want
her
so
much
to
have
a
will
of
her
own
,
if
only
that
he
may
know
how
to
rouse
her
to
pleasure
by
gratify
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
seldom
fall
asleep
at
night
without
his
last
thought
be
devote
to
some
little
plan
for
the
morrow
,
that
he
fancy
she
would
like
;
and
when
he
waken
in
the
early
dawn
he
look
to
see
if
she
be
indeed
sleep
by
his
side
,
or
whether
it
be
not
all
a
dream
that
he
call
Sylvia
"
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
her
affection
for
him
be
not
to
be
speak
of
in
the
same
way
as
his
for
her
,
but
he
find
much
happiness
in
only
be
allow
to
love
and
cherish
her
;
and
with
the
patient
perseverance
that
be
one
remarkable
feature
in
his
character
,
he
go
on
strive
to
deepen
and
increase
her
love
when
most
other
man
would
have
give
up
the
endeavour
,
make
themselves
content
with
half
a
heart
,
and
turn
to
some
other
object
of
attainment
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
Philip
be
trouble
by
a
dream
that
recur
whenever
he
be
over
-
fatigue
,
or
otherwise
not
in
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
in
this
first
year
of
married
life
he
dream
this
dream
;
perhaps
as
many
as
eight
or
nine
time
,
and
it
never
vary
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
of
Kinraid
's
return
;
Kinraid
be
full
of
life
in
Philip
's
dream
,
though
in
his
wake
hour
he
could
and
do
convince
himself
by
all
the
law
of
probability
that
his
rival
be
dead
.
<EOS>
He
never
remember
the
exact
sequence
of
event
in
that
terrible
dream
after
he
have
rouse
himself
,
with
a
fight
and
a
struggle
,
from
his
feverish
slumber
.
<EOS>
He
be
generally
sit
up
in
bed
when
he
find
himself
conscious
,
his
heart
beat
wildly
,
with
a
conviction
of
Kinraid
's
live
presence
somewhere
near
him
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
occasionally
Sylvia
be
disturb
by
his
agitation
,
and
would
question
him
about
his
dream
,
have
,
like
most
of
her
class
at
that
time
,
great
faith
in
their
prophetic
interpretation
;
but
Philip
never
give
her
any
truth
in
his
reply
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
and
though
he
do
not
acknowledge
it
even
to
himself
,
the
long
-
desire
happiness
be
not
so
delicious
and
perfect
as
he
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
many
have
feel
the
same
in
their
first
year
of
married
life
;
but
the
faithful
,
patient
nature
that
still
work
on
,
strive
to
gain
love
,
and
capable
itself
of
steady
love
all
the
while
,
be
a
gift
not
give
to
all
.
  
<EOS>
for
many
week
after
their
wedding
,
Kester
never
come
near
them
:
a
chance
word
or
two
from
Sylvia
show
Philip
that
she
have
notice
this
and
regret
it
;
and
,
accordingly
,
he
make
it
his
business
at
the
next
leisure
opportunity
to
go
to
Haytersbank
<EOS>
(
never
say
a
word
to
his
wife
of
his
purpose
)
,
and
seek
out
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
whole
place
be
alter
!
<EOS>
It
be
new
white
-
washed
,
new
thatch
:
the
patch
of
colour
in
the
surround
ground
be
change
with
altered
tillage
;
the
great
geranium
be
go
from
the
window
,
and
instead
,
be
a
smart
knit
blind
.
<EOS>
child
play
before
the
house
-
door
;
a
dog
lie
on
the
step
fly
at
Philip
;
all
be
so
strange
,
that
it
be
even
the
strange
thing
of
all
for
Kester
to
appear
where
everything
else
be
so
alter
!
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
crabbed
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
latter
before
he
could
induce
Kester
to
promise
to
come
down
into
the
town
and
see
Sylvia
in
her
new
home
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
,
the
visit
when
pay
be
but
a
failure
;
at
least
,
it
seem
so
at
the
time
,
though
probably
it
break
the
ice
of
restraint
which
be
form
over
the
familiar
intercourse
between
Kester
and
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
the
old
servant
be
daunt
by
see
Sylvia
in
a
strange
place
,
and
stand
,
sleek
his
hair
down
,
and
furtively
look
about
him
,
instead
of
seat
himself
on
the
chair
<EOS>
Sylvia
have
so
eagerly
bring
forward
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
then
his
sense
of
the
estrangement
cause
by
their
new
position
infect
her
,
and
she
begin
to
cry
pitifully
,
say
,
    
"
oh
,
Kester
!
<EOS>
Kester
!
<EOS>
tell
me
about
Haytersbank

<EOS>
be
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
a
can
not

say
Kester
,
thankful
to
have
a
subject

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
they'n

They

They

go
on
discourse
on
Haytersbank
and
the
old
day
,
till
Bell
Robson
,
have
finish
her
afternoon
nap
,
come
slowly
down
-
stair
to
join
them
;
and
after
that
the
conversation
become
so
broken
up
,
from
the
desire
of
the
other
two
to
attend
and
reply
as
best
they
could
to
her
fragmentary
and
disjointed
talk
,
that
Kester
take
his
leave
before
long
;
fall
,
as
he
do
so
,
into
the
formal
and
unnaturally
respectful
manner
which
he
have
adopt
on
first
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
run
after
him
,
and
bring
him
back
from
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
think
of
thy
go
away
,
Kester
,
without
either
bit
or

nay

thee

"
  
<EOS>
Kester
stand
at
the
door
,
half
shy
,
half
pleased
,
while
Sylvia
,
in
all
the
glow
and
hurry
of
a
young
housekeeper
's
hospitality
,
seek
for
the
decanter
of
wine
,
and
a
wine
-
glass
in
the
corner
cupboard
,
and
hastily
cut
an
immense
wedge
of
cake
,
which
she
cram
into
his
hand
in
spite
of
his
remonstrance
;
and
then
she
pour
him
out
an
overflow
glass
of
wine
,
which
Kester
would
far
rather
have
go
without
,
as
he
know
manner
too
well
to
suppose
that
he
may
taste
it
without
have
go
through
the
preliminary
ceremony
of
wish
the
donor
health
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
stand
red
and
half
smile
,
with
his
cake
in
one
hand
,
his
wine
in
the
other
,
and
then
begin
,
      
"

"
  
have
end
his
oration

much
to
his
own
satisfaction

Kester
toss
off
his
glass
of
wine
,
smack
his
lip
,
wipe
his
mouth
with
the

pocket

and
make
off

<EOS>
that
night
Sylvia
speak
of
his
visit
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Philip
never
say
how
he
himself
have
bring
it
to
pass
,
nor
do
he
name
the
fact
that
he
have
hear
the
old
man
come
in
just
as
he
himself
have
intend
go
into
the
parlour
for
tea
,
but
have
keep
away
,
as
he
think
Sylvia
and
Kester
would
most
enjoy
their
interview
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
and
Sylvia
feel
as
if
her
husband
's
silence
be
unsympathize
,
and
shut
up
the
feeling
that
be
just
begin
to
expand
towards
him
.
<EOS>
She
sink
again
into
the
listless
state
of
indifference
from
which
nothing
but
some
reference
to
former
day
,
or
present
consideration
for
her
mother
,
could
rouse
her
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
be
almost
surprised
at
Sylvia
's
evident
liking
for
her
.
<EOS>
by
slow
degree
Hester
be
learn
to
love
the
woman
,
whose
position
as
Philip
's
wife
she
would
have
envy
<EOS>
so
keenly
have
she
not
be
so
truly
good
and
pious
.
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
seem
as
though
she
have
give
Hester
her
whole
affection
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
Hester
could
not
understand
this
,
while
she
be
touch
and
melt
by
the
trust
it
imply
.
<EOS>
for
one
thing
Sylvia
remember
and
regret
 
her
harsh
treatment
of
Hester
the
rainy
,
stormy
night
on
which
the
latter
have
come
to
Haytersbank
to
seek
her
and
her
mother
,
and
bring
them
into
Monkshaven
to
see
the
imprison
father
and
husband
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
have
be
strike
with
Hester
's
patient
endurance
of
her
rudeness
,
a
rudeness
which
she
be
conscious
that
she
herself
should
have
immediately
and
vehemently
resent
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
do
not
understand
how
a
totally
different
character
from
her
may
immediately
forgive
the
anger
she
could
not
forget
;
and
because
Hester
have
be
so
meek
at
the
time
,
Sylvia
,
who
know
how
passing
and
transitory
be
her
own
anger
,
think
that
all
be
forget
;
while
Hester
believe
that
the
word
,
which
she
herself
could
not
have
utter
except
under
deep
provocation
,
mean
much
more
than
they
do
,
and
admire
and
wonder
at
Sylvia
for
have
so
entirely
conquer
her
anger
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
the
two
different
woman
be
divergently
affect
by
the
extreme
fondness
which
Bell
have
show
towards
Hester
ever
since
Sylvia
's
wedding
-
day
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
who
have
always
receive
more
love
from
other
than
she
know
what
to
do
with
,
have
the
most
entire
faith
in
her
own
supremacy
in
her
mother
's
heart
,
though
at
time
Hester
would
do
certain
thing
more
to
the
poor
old
woman
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Hester
,
who
have
crave
for
the
affection
which
have
be
withhold
from
her
,
and
have
from
that
one
circumstance
become
distrustful
of
her
own
power
of
inspire
regard
,
while
she
exaggerate
the
delight
of
be
beloved
,
fear
lest
Sylvia
should
become
jealous
of
her
mother
's
open
display
of
great
attachment
and
occasional
preference
for
Hester
.
<EOS>
but
such
a
thought
never
enter
Sylvia
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
be
more
thankful
than
she
know
how
to
express
towards
any
one
who
make
her
mother
happy
;
as
have
be
already
say
,
the
contributing
to
Bell
Robson
's
pleasure
earn
Philip
more
of
his
wife
's
smile
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
and
Sylvia
throw
her
whole
heart
into
the
word
and
caress
she
lavish
on
Hester
whenever
poor
Mrs.
Robson
speak
of
the
goodness
and
kindness
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Hester
attribute
more
virtue
to
these
sweet
word
and
deed
of
gratitude
than
they
deserve
;
they
do
not
imply
in
Sylvia
any
victory
over
evil
temptation
,
as
they
would
have
do
in
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
Sylvia
's
fate
to
captivate
more
people
than
she
care
to
like
back
again
.
<EOS>
She
turn
the
head
of
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
who
could
hardly
congratulate
Philip
enough
on
his
choice
of
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
be
prepare
to
be
critical
on
one
who
have
interfere
with
their
favourite
project
of
a
marriage
between
Philip
and
Hester
;
and
,
though
full
of
compassion
for
the
cruelty
of
Daniel
Robson
's
fate
,
they
be
too
completely
man
of
business
not
to
have
some
apprehension
that
the
connection
of
Philip
Hepburn
with
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
be
hang
,
may
injure
the
shop
over
which
both
his
and
their
name
appear
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
possible
propriety
demand
that
they
should
pay
attention
to
the
bride
of
their
former
shopman
and
present
successor
;
and
the
very
first
visitor
whom
Sylvia
have
receive
after
her
marriage
have
be
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
in
their
sabbath
-
day
clothe
.
<EOS>
They
find
her
in
the
parlour
(
so
familiar
to
both
of
them
!
)
<EOS>
clear
-
starch
her
mother
's
cap
,
which
have
to
be
get
up
in
some
particular
fashion
that
Sylvia
be
afraid
of
dictate
to
Phoebe
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
disturbed
at
her
visitor
discover
her
at
this
employment
;
but
she
be
on
her
own
ground
,
and
that
give
her
self
-
possession
;
and
she
welcome
the
two
old
man
so
sweetly
and
modestly
,
and
look
so
pretty
and
feminine
,
and
,
besides
,
so
notable
in
her
handiwork
,
that
she
conquer
all
their
prejudice
at
one
blow
;
and
their
first
thought
on
leave
the
shop
be
how
to
do
her
honour
,
by
invite
her
to
a
supper
party
at
Jeremiah
Foster
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
dismay
when
she
be
bidden
to
this
wedding
feast
,
and
Philip
have
to
use
all
his
authority
,
though
tenderly
,
to
make
her
consent
to
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
to
merry
country
party
like
the
Corneys
'
,
and
to
bright
haymake
romp
in
the
open
air
;
but
never
to
a
set
stately
party
at
a
friend
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
fain
have
make
attendance
on
her
mother
an
excuse
;
but
Philip
know
he
must
not
listen
to
any
such
plea
,
and
apply
to
Hester
in
the
dilemma
,
ask
her
to
remain
with
Mrs.
Robson
while
he
and
Sylvia
go
out
visit
;
and
Hester
have
willingly
,
nay
,
eagerly
consent
 
<EOS>
it
be
much
more
to
her
taste
than
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
so
Philip
and
Sylvia
set
out
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
down
Bridge
Street
,
across
the
bridge
,
and
then
clamber
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
on
the
way
he
give
her
the
direction
she
ask
for
about
her
behaviour
as
bride
and
most
honoured
guest
;
and
altogether
succeed
,
against
his
intention
and
will
,
in
frighten
her
so
completely
as
to
the
grandeur
and
importance
of
the
occasion
,
and
the
necessity
of
remember
certain
set
rule
,
and
make
certain
set
speech
and
attend
to
them
when
the
right
time
come
,
that
,
if
any
one
so
naturally
graceful
could
have
be
awkward
,
Sylvia
would
have
be
so
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
sate
,
pale
and
weary
-
look
,
on
the
very
edge
of
her
chair
;
she
utter
the
formal
word
which
Philip
have
tell
her
be
appropriate
to
the
occasion
,
and
she
heartily
wish
herself
safe
at
home
and
in
bed
.
<EOS>
yet
she
leave
but
<EOS>
one
unanimous
impression
on
the
company
when
she
go
away
,
namely
,
that
she
be
the
pretty
and
best
-
behave
woman
they
have
ever
see
,
and
that
Philip
Hepburn
have
do
well
in
choose
her
,
felon
's
daughter
though
she
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
both
the
host
have
follow
her
into
the
lobby
to
help
Philip
in
cloak
her
,
and
put
on
her
patten
.
<EOS>
They
be
full
of
old
-
fashioned
compliment
and
good
wish
;
one
speech
of
theirs
come
up
to
her
memory
in
future
year
:
    
"
now
,
Sylvia
Hepburn
,
"
say
Jeremiah
,
"
I
have
know
thy
husband
long
,
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
but
<EOS>
what
thou
hast
do
well
in
choose
him
;
but
if
he
ever
neglect
or
ill
-
use
thee
,
come
to
me
,
and
I
will
give
him
a
sound
lecture
on
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
mind
,
I
be
thy
friend
from
this
day
forrard
,
and
ready
to
take
thy
part
against
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
smile
as
if
the
day
would
never
come
when
he
should
neglect
or
ill
-
use
his
darling
;
Sylvia
smile
a
little
,
without
much
attend
to
,
or
care
for
,
the
word
that
be
detain
her
,
tired
as
she
be
;
John
and
Jeremiah
chuckle
over
the
joke
;
but
the
word
come
up
again
in
after
day
,
as
word
idly
speak
sometimes
do
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
end
of
that
first
year
,
Philip
have
learn
to
be
jealous
of
his
wife
's
new
love
for
Hester
.
<EOS>
to
the
latter
,
Sylvia
give
the
free
confidence
on
many
thing
which
Philip
fancy
she
withhold
from
him
.
<EOS>
a
suspicion
cross
his
mind
,
from
time
to
time
,
that
Sylvia
may
speak
of
her
former
lover
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
not
unnatural
,
he
think
,
if
she
do
so
,
believe
him
to
be
dead
;
but
the
idea
irritate
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
entirely
mistaken
,
however
;
Sylvia
,
with
all
her
apparent
frankness
,
keep
her
deep
sorrow
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
never
mention
her
father
's
name
,
though
he
be
continually
present
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
speak
of
Kinraid
to
human
being
,
though
,
for
his
sake
,
her
voice
soften
when
,
by
chance
,
she
speak
to
a
pass
sailor
;
and
for
his
sake
her
eye
linger
on
such
man
longer
than
on
other
,
try
to
discover
in
them
something
of
the
old
familiar
gait
;
and
partly
for
his
dead
sake
,
and
partly
because
of
the
freedom
of
the
outlook
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
,
she
be
glad
occasionally
to
escape
from
the
comfortable
imprisonment
of
her
"
parlour
"
,
and
the
close
street
around
the
market
-
place
,
and
to
mount
the
cliff
and
sit
on
the
turf
,
gaze
abroad
over
the
wide
still
expanse
of
the
open
sea
;
for
,
at
that
height
,
even
break
wave
only
look
like
broken
line
of
white
foam
on
the
blue
watery
plain
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
want
any
companion
on
these
ramble
,
which
have
somewhat
of
the
delight
of
steal
pleasure
;
for
all
the
other
respectable
matron
and
town
-
dweller
whom
she
know
be
content
to
have
always
a
business
object
for
their
walk
,
or
else
to
stop
at
home
in
their
own
household
;
and
Sylvia
be
rather
ashamed
of
her
own
yearning
for
solitude
and
open
air
,
and
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
mother
-
like
sea
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
take
off
her
hat
,
and
sit
there
,
her
hand
clasp
her
knee
,
the
salt
air
lift
her
bright
curl
,
gaze
at
the
distant
horizon
over
the
sea
,
in
a
sad
dreaminess
of
thought
;
if
she
have
be
ask
on
what
she
meditate
,
she
could
not
have
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
the
time
come
when
she
be
a
prisoner
in
the
house
;
a
prisoner
in
her
room
,
lie
in
bed
with
a
little
baby
by
her
side
 
her
child
,
Philip
's
child
.
<EOS>
His
pride
,
his
delight
know
no
bound
;
this
be
a
new
fast
tie
between
them
;
this
would
reconcile
her
to
the
kind
of
life
that
,
with
all
its
respectability
and
comfort
,
be
so
different
from
what
she
have
live
before
,
and
which
Philip
have
often
perceive
that
she
feel
to
be
dull
and
restrain
.
<EOS>
He
already
begin
to
trace
in
the
little
girl
,
only
a
few
day
old
,
the
lovely
curve
that
he
know
so
well
by
heart
in
the
mother
's
face
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
too
,
pale
,
still
,
and
weak
,
be
very
happy
;
yes
,
really
happy
for
the
first
time
since
her
irrevocable
marriage
.
<EOS>
for
its
irrevocableness
have
weigh
much
upon
her
with
a
sense
of
dull
hopelessness
;
she
feel
all
Philip
's
kindness
,
she
be
grateful
to
him
for
his
tender
regard
towards
her
mother
,
she
be
learn
to
love
him
as
well
as
to
like
and
respect
him
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
what
else
she
could
have
do
but
marry
so
true
a
friend
,
and
she
and
her
mother
so
friendless
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
like
lead
on
her
morning
spirit
when
she
awake
and
remember
that
the
decision
be
make
,
the
dead
be
do
,
<EOS>
the
choice
take
which
come
to
most
people
but
once
in
their
life
.
<EOS>
now
the
little
baby
come
in
upon
this
state
of
mind
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
into
a
gloomy
room
.
  
<EOS>
even
her
mother
be
rejoice
and
proud
;
even
with
her
crazed
brain
and
broken
heart
,
the
sight
of
sweet
,
peaceful
infancy
bring
light
to
her
.
<EOS>
all
the
old
way
of
hold
a
baby
,
of
hush
it
to
sleep
,
of
tenderly
guard
its
little
limb
from
injury
,
come
back
,
like
the
habit
of
her
youth
,
to
Bell
;
and
she
be
never
so
happy
or
so
easy
in
her
mind
,
or
so
sensible
and
connect
in
her
idea
,
as
when
she
have
Sylvia
's
baby
in
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
sight
to
see
,
however
familiar
to
all
of
us
<EOS>
such
thing
may
be
 
the
pale
,
wear
old
woman
,
in
her
quaint
,
old
-
fashioned
country
dress
,
hold
the
little
infant
on
her
knee
,
look
at
its
open
,
unspeculative
eye
,
and
talk
the
little
language
to
it
as
though
it
could
understand
;
the
father
on
his
knee
,
keep
prisoner
by
a
small
,
small
finger
curl
round
his
strong
and
sinewy
one
,
and
gaze
at
the
tiny
creature
with
wonder
idolatry
;
the
young
mother
,
fair
,
pale
,
and
smile
,
prop
up
on
pillow
in
order
that
she
,
too
,
may
see
the
wonderful
babe
;
it
be
astonish
how
the
doctor
could
come
and
go
without
be
draw
into
the
admire
vortex
,
and
look
at
this
baby
just
as
if
baby
come
into
the
world
every
day
.

fondly

"
  
<EOS>
She
lift
her
pale
face
from
her
pillow
,
and
put
up
her
lip
to
kiss
him
for
these
word
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
on
that
day
Philip
reach
the
zenith
of
his
life
's
happiness
.
    
<EOS>
EVIL
OMENS
  
<EOS>
the
first
step
in
Philip
's
declension
happen
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
have
make
rapid
progress
in
her
recovery
;
but
now
she
seem
at
a
stationary
point
of
weakness
;
wakeful
night
succeed
to
languid
day
.
<EOS>
occasionally
she
catch
a
little
sleep
in
the
afternoon
,
but
she
usually
awake
startled
and
feverish
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
Philip
have
steal
upstairs
to
look
at
her
and
his
child
;
but
the
effort
he
make
at
careful
noiselessness
make
the
door
creak
on
its
hinge
as
he
open
it
.
<EOS>
the
woman
employ
to
nurse
her
have
take
the
baby
into
another
room
that
no
sound
may
rouse
her
from
her
slumber
;
and
Philip
would
probably
have
be
warn
against
enter
the
chamber
where
his
wife
lie
sleep
have
he
be
perceive
by
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
open
the
door
,
make
a
noise
,
and
Sylvia
start
up
,
her
face
all
one
flush
,
her
eye
wild
and
uncertain
;
she
look
about
her
as
if
she
do
not
know
where
she
be
;
push
the
hair
off
her
hot
forehead
;
all
which
action
Philip
see
,
dismayed
and
regretful
.
<EOS>
but
he
keep
still
,
hope
that
she
would
lie
down
and
compose
herself
.
<EOS>
instead
she
stretch
out
her
arm
imploringly
,
and
say
,
in
a
voice
full
of
yearning
and
tear
,
    
"
<EOS>
oh
!
Charley
!
<EOS>
come
to
me
 
come
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
as
she
more
fully
become
aware
of
the
place
where
she
be
,
her
actual
situation
<EOS>
,
she
sink
back
and
feebly
begin
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
boil
within
him
;
any
man
's
would
under
the
circumstance
,
but
he
have
the
sense
of
guilty
concealment
to
aggravate
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
Her
weak
cry
after
another
man
,
too
,
irritate
him
,
partly
through
his
anxious
love
,
which
make
him
wise
to
know
how
much
physical
harm
she
be
do
herself
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
stir
,
or
unintentionally
make
some
sound
:
she
start
up
afresh
,
and
call
out
,
    
<EOS>
"
oh
,
who
be
theere
?
<EOS>
do
,
for
God
's
sake
,
tell
me
who
yo
'
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
me
,
"
say
Philip
,
come
forwards
,
strive
to
keep
down
the
miserable
complication
of
love
and
jealousy
,
and
remorse
and
anger
,
that
make
his
heart
beat
so
wildly
,
and
almost
take
him
out
of
himself
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
must
have
be
quite
beside
himself
for
the
time
,
or
he
could
never
have
go
on
to
utter
the
unwise
,
cruel
word
he
do
.
<EOS>
but
she
speak
first
,
in
a
distressed
and
plaintive
tone
of
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Philip
,
I
have
be
asleep
,
and
yet
I
think
I
be
awake
!
<EOS>
and
I
see
Charley
Kinraid
as
plain
as
iver
I
see
thee
now
,
and
he
be
not
drown
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
be
alive
somewheere
;
he
be
so
clear
and
life
-
like
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
wring
her
hand
in
feverish
distress
.
<EOS>
urge
by
passionate
feeling
of
various
kind
,
and
also
by
his
desire
to
quench
the
agitation
which
be
do
her
harm
,
Philip
speak
,
hardly
know
what
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kinraid
's
dead
,
I
tell
yo
'
,
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
and
what
kind
of
a
woman
be
yo
'
to
go
dream
of
another
man
<EOS>
i
'
this
way
,
and
take
on
so
about
him
,
when
yo're
a
wed
wife
,
with
a
child
as
yo've
borne
to
another
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
he
could
have
bite
out
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
with
the
mute
reproach
which
some
of
us
see
(
God
help
us
!
)
<EOS>
in
the
eye
of
the
dead
,
as
they
come
before
our
sad
memory
in
the
night
-
season
;
look
at
him
with
such
a
solemn
,
search
look
,
never
say
a
word
of
reply
or
defence
.
<EOS>
then
she
lie
down
,
motionless
and
silent
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
instantly
sting
with
remorse
for
his
speech
;
the
word
be
not
beyond
his
lip
when
an
agony
have
enter
his
heart
;
but
her
steady
,
dilate
eye
have
keep
him
dumb
and
motionless
as
if
by
a
spell
.
  
<EOS>
now
he
rush
to
the
bed
on
which
she
lie
,
and
half
knelt
,
half
throw
himself
upon
it
,
implore
her
to
forgive
him
;
regardless
for
the
time
of
any
evil
consequence
to
her
,
it
seem
as
if
he
must
have
her
pardon
 
<EOS>
her
relenting
 
at
any
price
,
even
if
they
both
die
in
the
act
of
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
but
she
lie
speechless
,
and
,
as
far
as
she
could
be
,
motionless
,
the
bed
tremble
under
her
with
the
quivering
she
could
not
still
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
wild
tone
catch
the
nurse
's
ear
,
and
she
enter
full
of
the
dignified
indignation
of
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
yo

for

yo'r

<EOS>
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
She

go
down

and
leave
her
i

peace
if

"
  
<EOS>
Her
anger
be
rise
as
she
catch
sight
of
Sylvia
's
averted
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
flush
crimson
,
her
eye
full
of
intense
emotion
of
some
kind
,
her
lip
compress
;
but
an
involuntary
twitching
overmaster
her
resolute
stillness
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
who
do
not
see
the
averted
face
,
nor
understand
the
real
danger
in
which
he
be
place
his
wife
,
feel
as
though
he
must
have
one
word
,
one
responsive
touch
of
the
hand
which
lie
passive
in
his
,
which
be
not
even
draw
away
from
the
kiss
with
which
he
cover
it
,
any
more
than
if
it
have
be
an
impassive
stone
.
<EOS>
the
nurse
have
fairly
to
take
him
by
the
shoulder
,
and
turn
him
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
the
doctor
have
to
be
summon
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
nurse
give
him
her
version
of
the
event
of
the
afternoon
,
with
much
_
animus
_
against
Philip
;
and
the
doctor
think
it
his
duty
to
have
some
very
serious
conversation
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
Mr.
Hepburn
,
that
,
in
the
state
your
wife
have
be
in
for
some
day
,
it
be
little
less
than
madness
on
your
part
to
speak
to
her
about
anything
that
could
give
rise
to
strong
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
madness
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
reply
Philip
,
in
a
low
,
miserable
tone
of
voice
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
heart
be
touch
,
in
spite
of
the
nurse
's
accusation
against
the
scold
husband
.
<EOS>
yet
the
danger
be
now
too
serious
for
him
to
mince
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
that
I
can
not
answer
for
her
life
,
unless
the
great
precaution
be
take
on
your
part
,
and
unless
the
measure
I
shall
use
have
the
effect
I
wish
for
in
the
next
twenty
-
four
hour
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
the
verge
of
a
brain
fever
.
<EOS>
any
allusion
to
the
subject
which
have
be
the
final
cause
of
the
state
in
which
she
now
be
must
be
most
cautiously
avoid
,
even
to
a
chance
word
which
may
bring
it
to
her
memory
.

"
  
<EOS>
and
so
on
;
<EOS>
but
Philip
seem
to
hear
only
this
:
then
he
may
not
express
contrition
,
or
sue
for
pardon
,
he
must
go
on
unforgiven
through
all
this
stress
of
anxiety
;
and
even
if
she
recover
the
doctor
warn
him
of
the
undesirableness
of
recur
to
what
have
pass
!
  
<EOS>
heavy
miserable
time
of
endurance
and
waiting
have
to
be
pass
through
by
all
during
the
course
of
their
life
;
and
Philip
have
have
his
share
of
such
season
,
when
the
heart
,
and
the
will
,
and
the
speech
,
and
the
limb
,
must
be
bind
down
with
strong
resolution
to
patience
.
  
<EOS>
for
many
day
,
nay
,
for
week
,
he
be
forbid
to
see
Sylvia
,
as
the
very
sound
of
his
footstep
bring
on
a
recurrence
of
the
fever
and
convulsive
movement
.
<EOS>
yet
she
seem
,
from
question
she
feebly
ask
the
nurse
,
to
have
forget
all
that
have
happen
on
the
day
of
her
attack
from
the
time
when
she
drop
off
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
but
how
much
she
remember
of
after
occurrence
no
one
could
ascertain
.
<EOS>
She
be
quiet
enough
when
,
at
length
,
Philip
be
allow
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
half
jealous
of
his
child
,
when
he
watch
how
she
could
smile
at
it
,
while
she
never
change
a
muscle
of
her
face
at
all
he
could
do
or
say
.
  
<EOS>
and
of
a
piece
with
this
extreme
quietude
and
reserve
be
her
behaviour
to
him
when
at
length
she
have
fully
recover
,
and
be
able
to
go
about
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
think
many
a
time
of
the
word
she
have
use
long
before
 
before
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
ominous
word
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
in
me
to
forgive
;
I
sometimes
think
it
be
not
in
me
to
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
tender
even
to
humility
in
his
conduct
towards
her
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
stir
her
from
her
fortress
of
reserve
.
<EOS>
and
he
know
she
be
so
different
;
he
know
how
loving
,
nay
,
passionate
,
be
her
nature
 
<EOS>
vehement
,
demonstrative
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
he
stir
her
once
more
into
expression
,
even
if
the
first
show
or
speech
she
make
be
of
anger
?
<EOS>
then
he
try
be
angry
with
her
himself
;
he
be
sometimes
unjust
to
her
consciously
and
of
a
purpose
,
in
order
to
provoke
her
into
defend
herself
,
and
appeal
against
his
unkindness
.
<EOS>
He
only
seem
to
drive
her
love
away
still
more
.
  
<EOS>
if
any
one
have
know
all
that
be
pass
in
that
household
,
while
yet
the
story
of
it
be
not
end
,
nor
,
indeed
,
come
to
its
crisis
,
their
heart
would
have
be
sorry
for
the
man
who
linger
long
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
his
wife
sate
coo
and
talk
to
her
baby
,
and
sometimes
laugh
back
to
it
,
or
who
be
soothe
the
querulousness
of
fail
age
with
every
possible
patience
of
love
;
sorry
for
the
poor
listener
who
be
hunger
for
the
profusion
of
tenderness
thus
scatter
on
the
senseless
air
,
yet
only
by
stealth
catch
the
echo
of
what
ought
to
have
be
his
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
difficult
to
complain
,
too
;
impossible
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
everything
that
a
wife
could
do
from
duty
she
do
;
but
the
love
seem
to
have
flee
,
and
,
in
such
case
,
no
reproach
or
complaint
can
avail
to
bring
it
back
.
<EOS>
so
reason
outsider
,
and
be
convince
of
the
result
before
the
experiment
be
make
.
<EOS>
but
Philip
could
not
reason
,
or
could
not
yield
to
reason
;
and
so
he
complain
and
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
much
answer
him
;
but
he
think
that
her
eye
express
the
old
word
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
in
me
to
forgive
;
I
sometimes
think
it
be
not
in
me
to
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
an
old
story
,
an
ascertained
fact
,
that
,
even
in
the
most
tender
and
stable
masculine
nature
,
at
the
supreme
season
of
their
life
,
there
be
room
for
other
thought
and
passion
than
such
as
be
connect
with
love
.
<EOS>
even
with
the
most
domestic
and
affectionate
man
,
their
emotion
seem
to
be
keep
in
a
cell
distinct
and
away
from
their
actual
life
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
other
thought
and
other
occupation
than
those
connect
with
his
wife
during
all
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
an
uncle
of
his
mother
's
,
a
Cumberland
"
statesman
"
,
of
whose
existence
he
be
barely
conscious
,
die
about
this
time
,
leave
to
his
unknown
great
-
nephew
four
or
five
hundred
pound
,
which
put
him
at
once
in
a
different
position
with
regard
to
his
business
.
<EOS>
Henceforward
his
ambition
be
rouse
,
 
such
humble
ambition
as
befit
a
shop
-
keeper
in
a
country
town
sixty
or
seventy
year
ago
.
<EOS>
to
be
respect
by
the
man
around
him
have
always
be
an
object
with
him
,
and
be
,
perhaps
,
become
more
so
than
ever
now
,
as
a
sort
of
refuge
from
his
deep
,
sorrowful
mortification
in
other
direction
.
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
pleased
at
be
make
a
sidesman
;
and
,
in
preparation
for
the
further
honour
of
be
churchwarden
,
he
go
regularly
twice
a
day
to
church
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
there
be
enough
religious
feeling
in
him
to
make
him
disguise
the
worldly
reason
for
such
conduct
from
himself
.
<EOS>
He
believe
that
he
go
because
he
think
it
right
to
attend
public
worship
in
the
parish
church
whenever
it
be
offer
up
;
but
it
may
be
question
of
him
,
as
of
many
other
,
how
far
he
would
have
be
as
regular
in
attendance
in
a
place
where
he
be
not
know
.
<EOS>
with
this
,
however
,
we
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
he
go
regularly
to
church
,
and
he
wish
his
wife
to
accompany
him
to
the
pew
,
newly
paint
,
with
his
name
on
the
door
,
where
he
sate
in
full
sight
of
the
clergyman
and
congregation
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
have
never
be
in
the
habit
of
such
regular
church
-
go
,
and
she
feel
it
as
a
hardship
,
and
slip
out
of
the
duty
as
often
as
ever
she
could
.
<EOS>
in
her
unmarried
day
,
she
and
her
parent
have
go
annually
to
the
mother
-
church
of
the
parish
in
which
Haytersbank
be
situate
:
on
the
Monday
succeed
the
Sunday
next
after
the
Romish
Saint
's
day
,
to
whom
the
church
be
dedicate
,
there
be
a
great
feast
or
wake
hold
;
and
,
on
the
Sunday
,
all
the
parishioner
come
to
church
from
far
and
near
.
<EOS>
frequently
,
too
,
in
the
course
of
the
year
,
Sylvia
would
accompany
one
or
other
of
her
parent
to
Scarby
Moorside
afternoon
service
,
 
when
the
hay
be
get
in
,
and
the
corn
not
ready
for
cut
,
or
the
cow
be
dry
and
there
be
no
afternoon
milk
.
<EOS>
many
clergyman
be
languid
in
those
day
,
and
do
not
too
curiously
inquire
into
the
reason
which
give
them
such
small
congregation
in
country
parish
.
  
<EOS>
now
she
be
marry
,
this
weekly
church
-
go
which
Philip
seem
to
expect
from
her
,
become
a
tie
and
a
small
hardship
,
which
connect
itself
with
her
life
of
respectability
and
prosperity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
crust
of
bread
and
liberty
'
be
much
more
accordant
to
Sylvia
's
nature
than
plenty
of
creature
comfort
and
many
restraint
.
<EOS>
another
wish
of
Philip
's
,
against
which
she
say
no
word
,
but
constantly
rebel
in
thought
and
deed
,
be
his
desire
that
the
servant
he
have
engage
during
the
time
of
her
illness
to
take
charge
of
the
baby
,
should
always
carry
it
whenever
it
be
take
out
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
often
feel
,
now
she
be
strong
,
as
if
she
would
far
rather
have
be
without
the
responsibility
of
have
this
nursemaid
,
of
whom
she
be
,
in
reality
,
rather
afraid
.
<EOS>
the
good
side
of
it
be
that
it
set
her
at
liberty
to
attend
to
her
mother
at
time
when
she
would
have
be
otherwise
occupy
with
her
baby
;
but
Bell
require
very
little
from
any
one
:
<EOS>
she
be
easily
pleased
,
unexacting
,
and
methodical
even
in
her
dotage
;
preserve
the
quiet
,
undemonstrative
habit
of
her
early
life
now
that
the
faculty
of
reason
,
which
have
be
at
the
basis
of
the
formation
of
such
habit
,
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
take
great
delight
in
watch
the
baby
,
and
be
pleased
to
have
it
in
her
care
for
a
short
time
;
but
she
doze
so
much
that
it
prevent
her
have
any
strong
wish
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
so
Sylvia
contrive
to
get
her
baby
as
much
as
possible
to
herself
,
in
spite
of
the
nursemaid
;
and
,
above
all
,
she
would
carry
it
out
,
softly
cradled
in
her
arm
,
warm
pillow
on
her
breast
,
and
bear
it
to
the
freedom
and
solitude
of
the
sea
-
shore
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
where
the
cliff
be
not
so
high
,
and
there
be
a
good
space
of
sand
and
shingle
at
all
low
tide
.
  
<EOS>
once
here
,
she
be
as
happy
as
she
ever
expect
to
be
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
the
fresh
sea
-
breeze
restore
something
of
the
colour
of
former
day
to
her
cheek
,
the
old
buoyancy
to
her
spirit
;
here
she
may
talk
her
heart
-
full
of
love
nonsense
to
her
baby
;
here
it
be
all
her
own
;
no
father
to
share
in
it
,
no
nursemaid
to
dispute
the
wisdom
of
anything
she
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
sing
to
it
<EOS>
,
she
toss
it
;
it
crow
and
it
laugh
back
again
,
till
both
be
weary
;
and
then
she
would
sit
down
on
a
broken
piece
of
rock
,
and
fall
to
gaze
on
the
advance
wave
catch
the
sunlight
on
their
crest
,
advance
,
recede
,
for
ever
and
for
ever
,
as
they
have
do
all
her
life
long
 
as
they
do
when
she
have
walk
with
them
that
once
by
the
side
of
Kinraid
;
those
cruel
wave
that
,
forgetful
of
the
happy
lover
'
talk
by
the
side
of
their
water
,
have
carry
one
away
,
and
drown
him
deep
till
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
every
time
she
sate
down
to
look
at
the
sea
,
this
process
of
thought
be
go
through
up
to
this
point
;
the
next
step
would
,
she
know
,
bring
her
to
the
question
she
dare
not
,
must
not
ask
.
<EOS>
He
be
dead
;
he
must
be
dead
;
for
be
she
not
Philip
's
wife
?
<EOS>
then
come
up
the
recollection
of
Philip
's
speech
,
never
forget
,
only
bury
out
of
sight
:
"
what
kind
of
a
woman
be
yo
'
to
go
on
dream
of
another
man
,
and
yo
'
a
wed
wife
?
"
<EOS>
She
use
to
shudder
as
if
cold
steel
have
be
plunge
into
her
warm
,
live
body
as
she
remember
these
word
;
cruel
word
,
harmlessly
provoke
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
much
associate
with
physical
pain
to
be
dwell
upon
;
only
their
memory
be
always
there
.
<EOS>
She
pay
for
these
happy
ramble
with
her
baby
by
the
depression
which
await
her
on
her
re
-
entrance
into
the
dark
,
confined
house
that
be
her
home
;
its
very
fulness
of
comfort
be
an
oppression
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
her
husband
see
her
pale
and
fatigued
,
he
be
annoy
,
and
sometimes
upbraid
her
for
do
what
be
so
unnecessary
as
to
load
herself
with
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
know
full
well
<EOS>
it
be
not
that
that
cause
her
weariness
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
he
inquire
and
discover
that
all
these
walk
be
take
in
one
direction
,
out
towards
the
sea
,
he
grow
jealous
of
her
love
for
the
inanimate
ocean
.
<EOS>
be
it
connect
in
her
mind
with
the
thought
of
Kinraid
?
<EOS>
why
do
she
so
perseveringly
,
in
wind
or
cold
,
go
out
to
the
sea
-
shore
;
the
western
side
,
too
,
where
,
if
she
go
but
far
enough
,
she
would
come
upon
the
mouth
of
the
Haytersbank
gully
,
the
point
at
which
she
have
last
see
Kinraid
?
<EOS>
such
fancy
haunt
Philip
's
mind
for
hour
after
she
have
acknowledge
the
direction
of
her
walk
.
<EOS>
but
he
never
say
a
word
that
could
distinctly
tell
her
he
dislike
her
go
to
the
sea
,
otherwise
she
would
have
obey
him
in
this
,
as
in
everything
else
;
for
absolute
obedience
to
her
husband
seem
to
be
her
rule
of
life
at
this
period
 
obedience
to
him
who
would
so
gladly
have
obey
her
small
wish
<EOS>
have
she
but
express
it
!
<EOS>
She
never
know
that
Philip
have
any
painful
association
with
the
particular
point
on
the
sea
-
shore
that
she
instinctively
avoid
,
both
from
a
consciousness
of
wifely
duty
,
and
also
because
the
sight
of
it
bring
up
so
much
sharp
pain
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
use
to
wonder
if
the
dream
that
precede
her
illness
be
the
suggestive
cause
that
draw
her
so
often
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Her
illness
consequent
upon
that
dream
<EOS>
have
fill
his
mind
,
so
that
for
many
month
he
himself
have
have
no
haunting
vision
of
Kinraid
to
disturb
his
slumber
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
old
dream
of
Kinraid
's
actual
presence
by
Philip
's
bedside
begin
to
return
with
fearful
vividness
.
<EOS>
night
after
night
it
recur
;
each
time
with
some
new
touch
of
reality
,
and
close
approach
;
till
it
be
as
if
the
fate
that
overtake
all
man
be
then
,
even
then
,
knock
at
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
business
Philip
prosper
.
<EOS>
man
praise
him
because
he
do
well
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
perseverance
,
the
capability
for
head
-
work
and
calculation
,
the
steadiness
and
general
forethought
which
may
have
make
him
a
great
merchant
if
he
have
live
in
a
large
city
.
<EOS>
without
any
effort
of
his
own
,
almost
,
too
,
without
Coulson
's
be
aware
of
it
,
Philip
be
now
in
the
position
of
superior
partner
;
the
one
to
suggest
and
arrange
,
while
Coulson
only
carry
out
the
plan
that
emanate
from
Philip
.
<EOS>
the
whole
work
of
life
be
suit
to
the
man
:
he
do
not
aspire
to
any
different
position
,
only
to
the
full
development
of
the
capability
of
that
which
he
already
hold
.
<EOS>
He
have
originate
several
fresh
scheme
with
regard
to
the
traffic
of
the
shop
;
and
his
old
master

the

it

and
never
name
his

important

<EOS>
possibly
,
if
he
have

Coulson
's
vanity
may
have
take
the
alarm
,
and
he
may
not
have
be
so
acquiescent
for

as

<EOS>
meanwhile
Hester
come
and
go
as
usual
;
in
so
quiet
and
methodical
a
way
,
with
so
even
and
undisturbed
a
temper
,
that
she
be
almost
forget
when
everything
go
well
in
the
shop
or
household
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
star
,
the
brightness
of
which
be
only
recognize
in
time
of
darkness
.
<EOS>
She
herself
be
almost
surprised
at
her
own
increase
regard
for
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
think
she
should
ever
be
able
to
love
the
woman
who
have
be
such
a
laggard
in
acknowledge
Philip
's
merit
;
and
from
all
she
have
ever
hear
of
Sylvia
before
she
come
to
know
her
,
from
the
angry
word
with
which
Sylvia
have
receive
her
when
she
have
first
go
to
Haytersbank
Farm
,
Hester
have
intend
to
remain
on
friendly
term
,
but
to
avoid
intimacy
.
<EOS>
but
her
kindness
to
Bell
Robson
have
win
both
the
mother
's
and
daughter
's
heart
;
and
in
spite
of
herself
,
certainly
against
her
own
mother
's
advice
,
she
have
become
the
familiar
friend
and
welcome
guest
of
the
household
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
very
change
in
Sylvia
's
whole
manner
and
way
,
which
grieve
and
vex
Philip
,
make
his
wife
the
more
attractive
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
bring
up
among
quaker
,
although
not
one
herself
,
she
admire
and
respect
the
staidness
and
outward
peacefulness
common
amongst
the
young
woman
of
that
sect
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
whom
she
have
expect
to
find
volatile
,
talkative
,
vain
,
and
wilful
,
be
quiet
and
still
,
as
if
she
have
be
bear
a
friend
<EOS>
:
she
seem
to
have
no
will
of
her
own
;
she
serve
her
mother
and
child
for
love
;
she
obey
her
husband
in
all
thing
,
and
never
appear
to
pine
after
gaiety
or
pleasure
.
<EOS>
and
yet
at
time
Hester
think
,
or
rather
a
flash
come
across
her
mind
,
as
if
all
thing
be
not
as
right
as
they
seem
.
<EOS>
Philip
look
old
,
more
care
-
wear
;
nay
,
even
Hester
be
oblige
to
allow
to
herself
that
she
have
hear
him
speak
to
his
wife
in
sharp
,
aggrieved
tone
.
<EOS>
innocent
Hester
!
<EOS>
she
could
not
understand
how
the
very
quality
she
so
admire
in
Sylvia
be
just
what
be
so
foreign
to
her
nature
that
the
husband
,
who
have
know
her
from
a
child
,
feel
what
an
unnatural
restraint
she
be
put
upon
herself
,
and
would
have
hail
petulant
word
or
wilful
action
with
an
unspeakable
thankfulness
for
relief
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
 
it
be
in
the
spring
of
1798
 
<EOS>
Hester
be
engage
to
stay
to
tea
with
the
Hepburns
,
in
order
that
after
that
early
meal
she
may
set
to
again
in
help
Philip
and
Coulson
to
pack
away
the
winter
cloth
and
flannel
,
for
which
there
be
no
longer
any
use
.
<EOS>
the
tea
-
time
be
half
-
past
four
;
about
four
o'clock
a
heavy
April
shower
come
on
,
the
hail
patter
against
the
window
-
pane
so
as
to
awaken
Mrs.
Robson
from
her
afternoon
's
nap
.
<EOS>
She
come
down
the
corkscrew
stair
,
and
find
Phoebe
in
the
parlour
arrange
the
tea
-
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
and
Mrs.
Robson
be
well
friend
than
Phoebe
and
her
young
mistress
;
and
so
they
begin
to
talk
a
little
together
in
a
comfortable
,
familiar
way
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
Philip
look
in
,
as
if
he
would
be
glad
to
see
the
tea
-
table
in
readiness
;
and
then
Phoebe
would
put
on
a
spurt
of
busy
bustle
,
which
cease
almost
as
soon
as
his
back
be
turn
,
<EOS>
so
eager
be
she
to
obtain
Mrs.
Robson
's
sympathy
in
some
little
dispute
that
have
occur
between
her
and
the
nurse
-
maid
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
misappropriate
some
hot
water
,
prepare
and
require
by
Phoebe
,
to
the
washing
of
the
baby
's
clothe
;
it
be
a
long
story
,
and
would
have
tire
the
patience
of
any
one
in
full
possession
of
their
sense
;
but
the
detail
be
just
within
poor
Bell
's
comprehension
,
and
she
be
listen
with
the
great
sympathy
.
<EOS>
both
the
woman
be
unaware
of
the
lapse
of
time
;
but
it
be
of
consequence
to
Philip
,
as
the
extra
labour
be
not
to
be
begin
until
after
tea
,
and
the
daylight
hour
be
precious
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
quarter
to
five
Hester
and
he
come
in
,
and
then
Phoebe
begin
to
hurry
.
<EOS>
Hester
go
up
to
sit
by
Bell
and
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
Philip
speak
to
Phoebe
in
the
familiar
word
of
country
-
folk
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
until
his
marriage
,
Phoebe
have
always
call
him
by
his
christian
name
,
and
have
find
it
very
difficult
to
change
it
into
"
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Sylvie
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
out
wi
'
t
'
babby
,
"
reply
Phoebe
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
can
not
Nancy
carry
it
out
?
"
ask
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
touch
on
the
old
grievance
:
he
be
tired
,
and
he
speak
with
sharp
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Phoebe
may
easily
have
tell
him
the
real
state
of
the
case
;
Nancy
be
busy
at
her
washing
,
which
would
have
be
reason
enough
.
<EOS>
but
the
nursemaid
have
vex
her
,
and
she
do
not
like
Philip
's
sharpness
,
so
<EOS>
she
only
say
,
    
"
It
be
noane
o
'
my
business
;
it
be
yo
'
t
'
look
after
yo'r
own
wife
and
child
;
but
yo'r
but
a
lad
after
a
'
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
conciliatory
speech
,
and
just
put
the
last
stroke
to
Philip
's
fit
of
ill
-
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
for
my
tea
to
-
night
,
"
say
he
,
to
Hester
,
when
all
be
ready
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sylvie
be
not
here
,
and
nothing
be
nice
,
or
as
it
should
be
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
set
to
on
t
'
stock
-
taking
.
<EOS>
do
not
yo
'
hurry
,
Hester
;
stop
and
chat
a
bit
with
th
'
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Philip
,
"
say
Hester
,
"
<EOS>
thou
's
sadly
tired
;
just
take
this
cup
o
'
tea
;
Sylvia
will
be
grieve
if
yo
'
have
not
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
do
not
care
whether
I
be
full
or
fast
,
"
reply
he
,
impatiently
put
aside
the
cup
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
she
do
she
would
ha
'
take
care
to
be
in
,
and
ha
'
see
to
thing
be
as
I
like
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
in
general
Philip
be
the
least
particular
of
man
about
meal
;
and
to
do
Sylvia
justice
,
she
be
scrupulously
attentive
to
every
household
duty
in
which
old
Phoebe
would
allow
her
to
meddle
,
and
always
careful
to
see
after
her
husband
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
but
Philip
be
too
vexed
at
her
absence
to
perceive
the
injustice
of
what
he
be
say
,
nor
be
he
aware
how
Bell
Robson
have
be
attend
to
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
sadly
discomfited
by
it
,
understand
just
enough
of
the
grievance
in
hand
to
think
that
her
daughter
be
neglectful
of
those
duty
which
she
herself
have
always
regard
as
paramount
to
all
other
;
nor
could
Hester
convince
her
that
Philip
have
not
mean
what
he
say
;
neither
could
she
turn
the
poor
old
woman
's
thought
from
the
word
which
have
cause
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Sylvia
come
in
,
bright
and
cheerful
,
although
breathless
with
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
she
,
take
off
her
wet
shawl
,
"
we
have
have
to
shelter
from
such
a
storm
of
rain
,
baby
and
me
 
but
see
!
<EOS>
she
be
none
the
bad
for
it
,
as
bonny
as
iver
,
bless
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
begin
some
speech
of
admiration
for
the
child
in
order
to
prevent
Bell
from
deliver
the
lecture
she
feel
sure
be
come
down
on
the
unsuspecting
Sylvia
;
but
all
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
be
be
complain
on
thee
,
Sylvie
,
"
say
Bell
,
in
the
way
in
which
she
have
speak
to
her
daughter
when
she
be
a
little
child
;
grave
and
severe
in
tone
and
look
,
more
than
in
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
forget
justly
what
about

but
he
speak
on
thy
neglect
him
continual
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
right
,
my
lass
,
it
be
not
right
;
a
woman
should
 
<EOS>
but
my
head
be
very
tired

and
all
I
can
think
on
to
say
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
be

of
me
,
and

"
say
Sylvia
,
ready
to
burst
into
tear
,
<EOS>
so
grieved
and
angry
<EOS>
be
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

say
Hester
,
"
thy

little
too
strong

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
say
no
more
,
but
the
bright
colour
fade
from
her
cheek
,
and
the
contraction
of
care
return
to
her
brow
.
<EOS>
She
occupy
herself
with

off
her
baby
be
walk
thing
.
<EOS>
Hester
linger
,
anxious
to
soothe
and
make
peace
;
she
be
look
sorrowfully
at
Sylvia
,
when
she
see
tear
drop
on
the
baby
's
cloak
,
and
then
it
seem
as
if
she
must
speak
a
word
of
comfort
before
go
to
the
shop
-
work
,
where
she
know
she
be
expect
by
both
Philip

<EOS>
She
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
,
and
come
close
up
to
Sylvia
,
and
kneel
down
by
her
,
she
whisper
,
    
"

Sylvia
look
up
,
and
Hester
then
more
fully

how
she
have

She
whisper
in

She
do
not

him

<EOS>
"
I

not

thee
there

Thou'll

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
,
she
look
up
at
him
,
and
her
lip
move
as
though
she
be
go
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
he
wish
she
would
,
that
they
may
come
to
a
wholesome
quarrel
,
and
a
make
friend
again
,
and
a
tender
kissing
,
in
which
he
may
whisper
penitence
for
all
his
hasty
word
,
or
unreasonable
vexation
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
come
resolve
not
to
speak
,
for
fear
of
show
too
much
passion
,
too
much
emotion
.
<EOS>
only
as
she
be
go
away
she
turn
and
say
,
    
"
Philip

<EOS>
Our

us
make
as

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie

Sylvie

"
<EOS>
he
call
after
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
hear
,
but
she
do
not
turn
.
<EOS>
He
go
after
her
,
and
seize
her
by
the
arm
rather
roughly
;
she
have
sting
him
to
the
heart
with
her
calm
word
,
which
seem
to
reveal
a
long
-
form
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
almost
fiercely
,
"
what
do
yo

mean
by
what
you
have
say
?
<EOS>
speak
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
an
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
almost
shake
her
:
<EOS>
she
be
half
frightened
by
his
vehemence
of
behaviour
,
which
she
take
for
pure
anger
,
while
it
be
the
outburst
of
agonized
and
unrequited
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
!
<EOS>
oh
,
Philip
,
yo
'
hurt
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
Hester
come
up
;
Philip
be
ashamed
of
his
passionate
way
in
her
serene
presence
,
and
loosen
his
grasp
of
his
wife
,
and
she
run
away
;
run
into
her
mother
's
empty
room
,
as
to
a
solitary
place
,
and
there
burst
into
that
sob
,
miserable
crying
which
we
instinctively
know
be
too
surely
lessen
the
length
of
our
day
on
earth
to
be
indulge
in
often
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
have
exhaust
that
first
burst
and
lie
weak
and
quiet
for
a
time
,
she
listen
in
dread
expectation
of
the
sound
of
his
footstep
come
in
search
of
her
to
make
friend
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
detain
below
on
business
,
and
never
come
.
<EOS>
instead
,
her
mother
come
clamber
up
the
stair
;
she
be
now
in
the
habit
of
go
to
bed
between
seven
and
eight
,
and
to
-
night
she
be
retire
at
even
an
early
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
spring
up
and
draw
down
the
window
-
blind
,
and
make
her
face
and
manner
as
compose
as
possible
,
in
order
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
mother
's
last
wake
hour
.
<EOS>
She
help
her
to
bed
with
gentle
patience
;
the
restraint
impose
upon
her
by
her
tender
filial
love
be
good
for
her
,
though
all
the
time
she
be
long
to
be
alone
to
have
another
wild
outburst
.
<EOS>
when
her
mother
be
go
off
to
sleep
,
Sylvia
go
to
look
at
her
baby
,
also
in
a
soft
sleep
.
<EOS>
then
she
gaze
out
at
the
evening
sky
,
high
above
the
tile
roof
of
the
opposite
house
,
and
the
longing
to
be
out
under
the
peaceful
heavens
take
possession
of
her
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
only
comfort
,
"
say
she
to
herself
;
"
and
there
be
no
earthly
harm
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
ha
'
be
at
home
to
his
tea
,
if
I
could
;
but
when
he
do
not
want
me
,
and
mother
do
not
want
me
,
and
baby
be
either
in
my
arm
or
asleep
;
why
,
I
will
go
any
cry
<EOS>
my
fill
out
under
yon
great
quiet
sky
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stay
in
t
'
house
to
be
choke
up
wi
'
my
tear
,
nor
yet
to
have
him
come
about
me
either
for
scolding
or
peace
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
put
on
her
thing
and
go
out
again
;
this
time
along
the
High
Street
,
and
up
the
long
flight
of
step
towards
the
parish
church
,
and
there
she
stand
and
think
that
here
she
have
first
meet
Kinraid
,
at
Darley
's
burying
,
and
she
try
to
recall
the
very
look
of
<EOS>
all
the
sad
,
earnest
face
round
the
open
grave
 
<EOS>
the
whole
scene
,
in
fact
;
and
let
herself
give
way
to
the
miserable
regret
she
have
so
often
try
to
control
.
<EOS>
then
she
walk
on
,
cry
bitterly
,
<EOS>
almost
unaware
to
herself
;
on
through
the
high
,
bleak
field
at
the
summit
of
the
cliff
;
field
bound
by
loose
stone
fence
,
and
far
from
all
sight
of
the
habitation
of
man
.
<EOS>
but
,
below
,
the
sea
rise
and
rage
;
it
be
high
water
at
the
high
tide
,
and
the
wind
blow
gustily
from
the
land
,
vainly
combat
the
great
wave
that
come
invincibly
up
with
a
roar
and
an
impotent
furious
dash
against
the
base
of
the
cliff
below
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
hear
the
sound
of
the
passionate
rush
and
rebound
of
many
water
,
like
the
shock
of
mighty
gun
,
whenever
the
other
sound
of
the
bluster
gusty
wind
be
lull
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
She
be
more
quieted
by
this
temp
of
the
element
than
she
would
have
be
have
all
nature
seem
as
still
as
she
have
imagine
it
to
be
while
she
be
yet
in
-
door
and
only
see
a
part
of
the
serene
sky
.
  
<EOS>
She
fix
on
a
certain
point
,
in
her
own
mind
,
which
she
would
reach
,
and
then
turn
back
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
where
the
outline
of
the
land
curve
inward
,
dip
into
a
little
bay
.
<EOS>
here
the
field
-
path
she
have
hitherto
follow
descend
somewhat
abruptly
to
a
cluster
of
fisherman
's
cottage
,
hardly
large
enough
to
be
call
a
village
;
and
then
the
narrow
roadway
wind
up
the
rise
ground
till
it
again
reach
the
summit
of
the
cliff
that
stretch
along
the
coast
for
many
and
many
a
mile
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
say
to
herself
that
she
would
turn
homeward
when
she
come
within
sight
of
this
cove
,
 
Headlington
Cove
,
they
call
it
.
<EOS>
all
the
way
along
she
have
meet
no
one
since
she
have
leave
the
town
,
but
just
as
she
have
get
over
the
last
stile
,
or
ladder
of
stepping
-
stone
,
into
the
field
from
which
the
path
descend
,
she
come
upon
a
number
of
people
 
quite
a
crowd
,
in
fact
;
man
move
forward
in
a
steady
line
,
haul
at
a
rope
,
a
chain
,
or
something
of
that
kind
;
boy
,
child
,
and
woman
hold
baby
in
their
arm
,
as
if
all
be
fain
to
come
out
and
partake
in
some
general
interest
.
  
<EOS>
They
keep
within
a
certain
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
,
and
Sylvia
,
advance
a
little
,
now
see
the
reason
why
.
<EOS>
the
great
cable
the
man
hold
be
attach
to
some
part
of
a
smack
,
which
could
now
be
see
by
her
in
the
water
below
,
half
dismantle
,
and
all
but
a
wreck
,
yet
with
her
deck
cover
with
live
man
,
as
far
as
the
waning
light
would
allow
her
to
see
.
<EOS>
the
vessel
strain
to
get
free
of
the
strong
guiding
cable
;
the
tide
be
turn
,
the
wind
be
blow
off
shore
,
and
Sylvia
know
without
be
tell
,
that
almost
parallel
to
this
be
a
line
of
sunken
rock
that
have
be
fatal
to
many
a
ship
before
now
,
if
she
have
try
to
take
the
inner
channel
instead
of
keep
out
to
sea
for
mile
,
and
then
steer
in
straight
for
Monkshaven
port
.
<EOS>
and
the
ship
that
have
be
thus
lose
have
be
in
good
plight
and
order
compare
to
this
vessel
,
which
seem
nothing
but
a
hull
without
mast
or
sail
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
crowd
 
the
fisherman
from
the
hamlet
down
below
,
with
their
wife
and
child
 
all
have
come
but
<EOS>
the
bedridden
 
have
reach
the
place
where
Sylvia
stand
.
<EOS>
the
woman
,
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
,
rush
on
,
encourage
their
husband
and
son
by
word
,
even
while
they
hinder
them
by
action
;
and
,
from
time
to
time
,
one
of
them
would
run
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
shout
out
some
brave
word
of
hope
in
her
shrill
voice
to
the
crew
on
the
deck
below
.
<EOS>
whether
these
latter
hear
it
or
not
,
no
one
could
tell
;
but
it
seem
as
if
all
human
voice
must
be
lose
in
the
tempestuous
stun
and
tumult
of
wind
and
wave
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arm
who
so
employ
herself
.
<EOS>
as
the
strain
upon
the
cable
become
great
,
and
the
ground
on
which
they
strove
more
uneven
,
every
hand
be
need
to
hold
and
push
,
and
all
those
woman
who
be
unencumbered
hold
by
the
dear
rope
on
which
so
many
life
be
depend
.
<EOS>
on
they
come
,
a
long
line
of
human
being
,
black
against
the
ruddy
sunset
sky
.
<EOS>
as
they
come
near
Sylvia
,
a
woman
cry
out
,
    
"
Dunnot
stand
idle
,
lass
,
but
houd
on
wi

us

there
be
many
a

Tak

and
God
remember
thee
i

thy
need

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
need
no
second
word
;
a
place
be
make
for
her
,
and
in
an
instant
more
the
rope
be
pull
against
her
hand
till
it
seem
as
though
she
be
hold
fire
in
her
bare
palm
.
<EOS>
never
a
one
of
them
think
of
let
go
for
an
instant
,
though
when
all
be
over
<EOS>
many
of
their
hand
be
raw
and
bleeding
.
<EOS>
some
strong
,
experienced
fisherman
pass
a
word
along
the
line
from
time
to
time
,
give
direction
as
to
how
it
should
be
hold
accord
to
varying
occasion
;
but
few
among
the
rest
have
breath
or
strength
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
the
woman
and
child
that
accompany
them
run
on
before
,
break
down
the
loose
stone
fence
,
so
as
to
obviate
delay
or
hindrance
;
they
talk
continually
,
exhort
,
encouraging
,
explain
.
<EOS>
from
their
many
word
and
fragmentary
sentence
,
Sylvia
learn
that
the
vessel
be
suppose
to
be
a
Newcastle
smack
sailing
from
London
,
that
have
take
the
dangerous
inner
channel
to
save
time
,
and
have
be
catch
in
the
storm
,
which
she
be
too
crazy
to
withstand
;
and
that
if
by
some
dare
contrivance
of
the
fisherman
who
have
first
see
her
the
cable
have
not
be
get
ashore
,
she
would
have
be
cast
upon
the
rock
before
this
,
and
"
all
on
board
perish
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be

quoth
one
woman

a
could

they

They
be
as
pale
as

an

down
on

there

gowd
about
him

<EOS>
"
He
would
maybe
come
from
these
hom'ard
part
,
and
be
comin

to
see
his

else
it
be
no
common
for

to
sail

king

ship

it

<EOS>
"
  
one
more
great
push
and
mighty
strain
,
and
the
danger
be
past
;
the
vessel
 
or
what
remain
of
her
 
be
in
the
harbour
,
among
the
light
and
cheerful
sound
of
safety
.
<EOS>
the
fisherman
spring
down
the
cliff
to
the
quay
-
side
,
anxious
to
see
the
man
whose
life
they
have
save
;
the
woman
,
weary
and
over
-
excite
,
begin
to
cry
.
<EOS>
not
Sylvia
,
however
;
her
fount
of
tear
have
be
exhaust
earlier
in
the
day
:
her
principal
feeling
be
of
gladness
and
high
rejoicing
that
they
be
save
who
have
be
so
near
to
death
not
half
an
hour
before
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
like
to
have
see
the
man
,
and
shake
hand
with
them
all
round
.
<EOS>
but
instead
she
must
go
home
,
and
well
would
it
be
with
her
if
she
be
in
time
for
her
husband
's
supper
,
and
escape
any
notice
of
her
absence
.
<EOS>
so
she
separate
herself
from
the
group
of
woman
who
sate
on
the
grass
in
the
churchyard
,
await
the
return
of
such
of
their
husband
as
could
resist
the
fascination
of
the
Monkshaven
public
house

as
Sylvia
go
down
the
church
step
,
she
come
upon
one
of
the
fisherman

have

to
tow
the

into

"
there

<EOS>
the
street

hot

close
after

the

already

in

her
husband
be
in
the
habit
of
have
for
supper
stand
in
the
fender
before
the
fire
,
each
with
a
plate
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Nancy
have
go
to
bed
,
Phoebe

in
the
kitchen
;
Philip
be
still
in
the
ware

room
,
arrange

and
take

along
with
Coulson

for
Hester

home
to
her
mother

<EOS>
Sylvia
be
not
willing
to
go
and
seek
out
Philip
,
after
the
manner
in
which
they
have
part
.
<EOS>
all
the
despondency
of
her
life
become
present
to
her
again
as
she
sate
down
within
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
have
forget
it
in
her
interest
and
excitement
,
but
now
it
come
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
still
she
be
hungry
,
and
youthful
,
and
tired
.
<EOS>
She
take
her
basin
up
,
and
be
eat
her
supper
when
she
hear
a
cry
of
her
baby
upstairs
,
and
run
away
to
attend
to
it
.
<EOS>
when
it
have
be
feed
and
hush
away
to
sleep
,
she
go
in
to
see
her
mother
,
attract
by
some
unusual
noise
in
her
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
find
Mrs.
Robson
awake
,
and
restless
,
and
ailing
;
dwell
much
on
what
Philip
have
say
in
his
anger
against
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
necessary
for
her
daughter
to
remain
with
her
;
so
Sylvia
steal
out
,
and
go
quickly
down
-
stair
to
Philip
 
now
sit
tired
and
wear
out
,
and
eat
his
supper
with
little
or
no
appetite
 
and
tell
him
she
mean
to
pass
the
night
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
His
answer
of
acquiescence
be
so
short
and
careless
,
or
so
it
seem
to
her
,
that
she
do
not
tell
him
any
more
of
what
she
have
do
or
see
that
evening
,
or
even
dwell
upon
any
detail
of
her
mother
's
indisposition
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
have
leave
the
room
,
Philip
set
down
his
half
-
finished
basin
of
bread
and
milk
,
and
sate
long
,
his
face
hide
in
his
fold
arm
.
<EOS>
the
wick
of
the
candle
grow
long
and
black
,
and
fall
,
and
sputter
,
and
gutter
;
he
sate
on
,
unheede
either
it
or
the
pale
gray
fire
that
be
die
out
 
dead
at
last
.
    
<EOS>
an
APPARITION
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
be
very
poorly
all
night
long
.
<EOS>
uneasy
thought
seem
to
haunt
and
perplex
her
brain
,
and
she
neither
sleep
nor
wake
,
but
be
restless
and
uneasy
in
her
talk
and
movement
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
lie
down
by
her
,
but
get
so
little
sleep
,
that
at
length
she
prefer
sit
in
the
easy
-
chair
by
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
here
she
drop
off
to
slumber
in
spite
of
herself
;
the
scene
of
the
evening
before
seem
to
be
repeat
;
the
cry
of
the
many
people
,
the
heavy
roar
and
dash
of
the
threaten
wave
,
be
repeat
in
her
ear
;
and
something
be
say
to
her
through
all
the
conflict
noise
,
 
what
it
be
she
could
not
catch
,
though
she
strain
to
hear
the
hoarse
murmur
that
,
in
her
dream
,
she
believe
to
convey
a
meaning
of
the
utmost
importance
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
dream
,
that
mysterious
,
only
half
-
intelligible
sound
,
recur
whenever
she
doze
,
and
her
inability
to
hear
the
word
utter
distress
her
so
much
,
that
at
length
she
sate
bolt
upright
,
resolve
to
sleep
no
more
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
talk
in
a
half
-
conscious
way
;
Philip
's
speech
of
the
evening
before
be
evidently
run
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
if
thou're
not
a
good
wife
to
him
,
it
will
just
break
my
heart
outright
.
<EOS>
a
woman
should
obey
her
husband
,
and
not
go
her
own
gait
.
<EOS>
I
never
leave
the
house
wi'out
<EOS>
tell
father
,
and
get
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
begin
to
cry
pitifully
,
and
to
say
unconnected
thing
,
till
Sylvia
,
to
soothe
her
,
take
her
hand
,
and
promise
never
to
leave
the
house
without
ask
her
husband
's
permission
,
though
in
make
this
promise
,
she
feel
as
if
she
be
sacrifice
her
last
pleasure
to
her
mother
's
wish
;
for
she
know
well
enough
that
Philip
would
always
raise
objection
to
the
ramble
which
remind
her
of
her
old
free
open
-
air
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
comfort
and
cherish
her
mother
she
would
have
do
anything
;
yet
this
very
morning
that
be
dawn
,
she
must
go
and
ask
his
permission
for
a
simple
errand
,
or
break
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
from
experience
that
nothing
quiet
her
mother
so
well
as
balm
-
tea
;
it
may
be
that
the
herb
really
possess
some
sedative
power
;
it
may
be
only
early
faith
,
and
often
repeat
experience
,
but
it
have
always
have
a
tranquillizing
effect
;
and
more
than
once
,
during
the
restless
hour
of
the
night
,
Mrs.
Robson
have
ask
for
it
;
but
Sylvia
's
stock
of
last
year
's
dead
leave
be
exhaust
.
<EOS>
still
she
know
where
a
plant
of
balm
grow
in
the
sheltered
corner
of
Haytersbank
Farm
garden
;
she
know
that
the
tenant
who
have
succeed
them
in
the
occupation
of
the
farm
have
have
to
leave
it
in
consequence
of
a
death
,
and
that
the
place
be
unoccupied
;
and
in
the
darkness
she
have
plan
that
if
she
could
leave
her
mother
after
the
dawn
come
,
and
she
have
attend
to
her
baby
,
she
would
walk
quickly
to
the
old
garden
,
and
gather
the
tender
sprig
which
she
be
sure
to
find
there
.
  
<EOS>
now
she
must
go
and
ask
Philip
;
and
till
she
hold
her
baby
to
her
breast
,
she
bitterly
wish
that
she
be
free
from
the
duty
and
chain
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
but
the
touch
of
its
waxen
finger
,
the
hold
of
its
little
mouth
,
make
her
relax
into
docility
and
gentleness
.
<EOS>
She
give
it
back
to
Nancy
to
be
dress
,
and
softly
open
the
door
of
Philip
's
bed
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
!
"
say
she
,
gently
.
"
<EOS>
Philip

"
  
<EOS>
He
start
up
from
dream
of
her
;
of
her
,
angry
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
there
,
rather
pale
with
her
night
's
watch
and
anxiety
,
but
look
meek
,
and
a
little
beseeching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother

have
such
a
bad
night
!
<EOS>
she
fancy
once
as
some
balm

tea

do
her
good
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
but
my
dry

"
Thou

eagerly
;

continue
he

catch
the
shadow
that
be
come
over
her
face
,
"
thou'd
rather
go

it

<EOS>
She
have
get
her
hat
and
shawl
,
and
be
off
before
he
have
finish
his
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
the
long
High
Street
be
almost
empty
of
people
at
that
early
hour
;
one
side
be
entirely
cover
by
the
cool
morning
shadow
which
lie
on
the
pavement
,
and
creep
up
the
opposite
house
till
only
the
topmost
story
catch
the
rosy
sunlight
.
<EOS>
up
the
hill
-
road
,
through
the
gap
in
the
stone
wall
,
across
the
dewy
field
,
Sylvia
go
by
the
very
short
path
she
know
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
only
once
be
at
Haytersbank
since
her
wedding
-
day
.
<EOS>
on
that
occasion
the
place
have
seem
strangely
and
dissonantly
change
by
the
numerous
child
who
be
divert
themselves
before
the
open
door
,
and
whose
plaything
and
clothe
strew
the
house
-
place
,
and
make
it
one
busy
scene
of
confusion
and
untidiness
,
more
like
the
Corneys
'
kitchen
in
former
time
,
than
her
mother
's
orderly
and
quiet
abode
.
<EOS>
those
little
child
be
fatherless
now
;
and
the
house
be
shut
up
,
await
the
entry
of
some
new
tenant
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
shutter
to
shut
;
the
long
low
window
be
blink
in
the
ray
of
the
morning
sun
;
the
house
and
cow
-
house
door
be
closed
,
and
no
poultry
wander
about
the
field
in
search
of
stray
grain
of
corn
,
or
early
worm
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
and
unfamiliar
silence
,
and
strike
solemnly
on
Sylvia
's
mind
.
<EOS>
only
a
thrush
in
the
old
orchard
down
in
the
hollow
,
out
of
sight
,
whistle
and
gurgle
with
continual
shrill
melody
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
go
slowly
past
the
house
and
down
the
path
lead
to
the
wild
,
deserted
bit
of
garden
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
the
last
tenant
have
have
a
pump
sink
for
them
,
and
resent
the
innovation
,
as
though
the
well
she
be
pass
could
feel
the
insult
.
<EOS>
over
it
grow
two
hawthorn
tree
;
on
the
bent
trunk
of
one
of
them
she
use
to
sit
,
long
ago
:
the
charm
of
the
position
be
enhance
by
the
possible
danger
of
fall
into
the
well
and
be
drown
.
<EOS>
the
rusty
unused
chain
be
wind
round
the
windlass
;
the
bucket
be
fall
to
piece
from
dryness
.
<EOS>
a
lean
cat
come
from
some
outhouse
,
and
mew
pitifully
with
hunger
;
accompany
Sylvia
to
the
garden
,
as
if
glad
of
some
human
companionship
,
yet
refuse
to
allow
itself
to
be
touch
.
<EOS>
primrose
grow
in
the
sheltered
place
,
just
as
they
formerly
do
;
and
make
the
uncultivated
ground
seem
less
deserted
than
the
garden
,
where
the
last
year
's
weed
be
rot
away
,
and
cumber
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
force
her
way
through
the
berry
bush
to
the
herb
-
plot
,
and
pluck
the
tender
leave
she
have
come
to
seek
;
sigh
a
little
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
then
she
retrace
her
step
;
pause
softly
before
the
house
-
door
,
and
enter
the
porch
and
kiss
the
senseless
wood
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
to
tempt
the
poor
gaunt
cat
into
her
arm
,
mean
to
carry
it
home
and
befriend
it
;
but
it
be
scare
by
her
endeavour
and
run
back
to
its
home
in
the
outhouse
,
make
a
green
path
across
the
white
dew
of
the
meadow
.
<EOS>
then
Sylvia
begin
to
hasten
home
,
think
,
and
remember
 
at
the
stile
that
lead
into
the
road
she
be
bring
short
up
.
  
<EOS>
some
one
stand
in
the
lane
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
gap
;
his
back
be
to
the
morning
sun
;
all
she
see
at
first
be
the
uniform
of
a
naval
officer
,
so
well
known
in
Monkshaven
in
those
day
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
go
hurry
past
him
,
not
look
again
,
although
her
clothe
almost
brush
his
,
as
he
stand
there
still
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
go
a
yard
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
half
a
yard
 
when
her
heart
leap
up
and
fall
again
dead
within
her
,
as
if
she
have
be
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
joy
and
passionate
love
.
"
<EOS>
Sylvia
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
round
;
he
have
turn
a
little
,
so
that
the
light
fall
straight
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
bronze
,
and
the
line
be
strengthen
;
but
it
be
the
same
face
she
have
last
see
in
Haytersbank
Gully
three
long
year
ago
,
and
have
never
think
to
see
in
life
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
close
to
her
and
hold
out
his
fond
arm
;
she
go
flutter
towards
their
embrace
,
as
if
draw
by
the
old
fascination
;
but
when
she
feel
them
close
round
her
,
she
start
away
,
and
cry
out
with
a
great
pitiful
shriek
,
and
put
her
hand
up
to
her
forehead
as
if
try
to
clear
away
some
bewilder
mist
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
look
at
him
once
more
,
a
terrible
story
in
her
eye
,
if
he
could
but
have
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
twice
she
open
her
stiff
lip
to
speak
,
and
twice
the
word
be
overwhelm
by
the
surge
of
her
misery
,
which
bear
them
back
into
the
depth
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
have
come
upon
her
too
suddenly
,
and
he
attempt
to
soothe
her
with
soft
murmur
of
love
,
and
to
woo
her
to
his
outstretched
hungry
arm
once
more
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
this
motion
of
his
,
she
make
a
gesture
as
though
push
him
away
;
and
with
an
inarticulate
moan
of
agony
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
once
more
,
and
turn
away
begin
to
run
blindly
towards
the
town
for
protection
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
minute
<EOS>
or
so
he
be
stun
with
surprise
at
her
behaviour
;
and
then
he
think
it
account
for
by
the
shock
of
his
accost
,
and
that
she
need
time
to
understand
the
unexpected
joy
.
<EOS>
so
he
follow
her
swiftly
,
ever
keep
her
in
view
,
but
not
try
to
overtake
her
too
speedily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
frighten
my
poor
love
,
"
he
keep
think
.
<EOS>
and
by
this
thought
he
try
to
repress
his
impatience
and
check
the
speed
he
long
to
use
;
yet
he
be
always
so
near
behind
that
her
quicken
sense
hear
his
well
-
know
footstep
follow
,
and
a
mad
notion
flash
across
her
brain
that
she
would
go
to
the
wide
full
river
,
and
end
the
hopeless
misery
she
feel
enshroud
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sure
hiding
-
place
from
all
human
reproach
and
heavy
mortal
woe
beneath
the
rush
water
bear
landward
by
the
morning
tide
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
can
tell
what
change
her
course
;
perhaps
the
thought
of
her
suck
child
;
perhaps
her
mother
;
perhaps
an
angel
of
God
;
no
one
on
earth
know
,
but
as
she
run
along
the
quay
-
side
she
all
at
once
turn
up
an
entry
,
and
through
an
open
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
follow
all
the
time
,
come
into
a
quiet
dark
parlour
,
with
a
cloth
and
tea
-
thing
on
the
table
ready
for
breakfast
;
the
change
from
the
bright
sunny
air
out
of
door
to
the
deep
shadow
of
this
room
make
him
think
for
the
first
moment
that
she
have
pass
on
,
and
that
no
one
be
there
,
and
he
stand
for
an
instant
baffle
,
and
hear
no
sound
<EOS>
but
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
;
but
an
irrepressible
sob
gasp
make
him
look
round
,
and
there
he
see
her
cower
behind
the
door
<EOS>
,
her
face
cover
tight
up
,
and
sharp
shudder
go
through
her
whole
frame
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
my
darling
!
"
say
he
,
go
up
to
her
,
and
try
to
raise
her
,
and
to
loosen
her
hand
away
from
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
too
sudden
for
thee
:
it
be
thoughtless
in
me
;
but
I
have
so
look
forward
to
this
time
,
and
see
thee
come
along
the
field
,
and
go
past
me
,
but
I
should
ha
'
be
more
tender
and
careful
of
thee
.
<EOS>
nay
!
<EOS>
let
me
have
another
look
of
thy
sweet
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
he
whisper
in
the
old
tone
of
manoeuvre
love
,
in
that
voice
she
have
yearn
and
hunger
to
hear
in
life
,
and
have
not
hear
,
for
all
her
longing
,
save
in
her
dream
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
to
crouch
more
and
more
into
the
corner
,
into
the
hide
shadow
 
to
sink
into
the
ground
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
once
more
he
speak
,
beseech
her
to
lift
up
her
face
,
to
let
him
hear
her
speak
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
only
moan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
think
he
could
change
his
tactic
,
and
pique
her
into
speak
,
that
he
would
make
a
pretence
of
suspicion
and
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
one
would
think
you
be
not
glad
to
see
me
back
again
at
length
.
<EOS>
I
only
come
in
late
last
night
,
and
my
first
thought
on
wakening
be
of
you
;
it
have
be
ever
since
I
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
take
her
hand
away
from
her
face
;
it
be
gray
as
the
face
of
death
;
her
awful
eye
be
passionless
in
her
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
have
yo
'
be
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
in
slow
,
hoarse
tone
,
as
if
her
voice
be
half
strangle
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
!
"
say
he
,
a
red
light
come
into
his
eye
,
as
he
bend
his
look
upon
her
;
now
,
indeed
,
a
true
and
not
an
assumed
suspicion
enter
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
;
then
,
come
a
step
nearer
to
her
,
and
take
her
hand
,
not
tenderly
this
time
,
but
with
a
resolution
to
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
your
cousin
 
Hepburn
<EOS>
,
I
mean
 
do
not
he
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
he
see
the
press
-
gang
seize
me
,
 
I
give
him
a
message
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
bade
you
keep
true
to
me
as
I
would
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
between
every
clause
of
this
speech
he
pause
and
gasp
for
her
answer
;
but
none
come
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
dilate
and
hold
his
steady
gaze
prisoner
as
with
a
magical
charm
 
neither
could
look
away
from
the
other
's
wild
,
search
gaze
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
end
,
she
be
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
she
cry
out
,
shrill
and
fierce
,
    
"
Philip
!
"
<EOS>
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Wilder
and
shriller
still
,
"
Philip
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
distant
ware
-
room
complete
the
last
night
's
work
before
the
regular
shop
hour
begin
;
before
breakfast
,
also
,
that
his
wife
may
not
find
him
wait
and
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
He
hear
her
cry
;
it
cut
through
door
,
and
still
air
,
and
great
bale
of
woollen
stuff
;
he
think
that
she
have
hurt
herself
,
that
her
mother
be
bad
,
that
her
baby
be
ill
,
and
he
hasten
to
the
spot
whence
the
cry
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
on
open
the
door
that
separate
the
shop
from
the
sitting
-
room
,
he
see
the
back
of
a
naval
officer
,
and
his
wife
on
the
ground
,
huddle
up
in
a
heap
;
when
she
perceive
him
come
in
,
she
drag
herself
up
by
mean
of
a
chair
,
grope
like
a
blind
person
,
and
come
and
stand
face
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
officer
turn
fiercely
round
,
and
would
have
come
towards
Philip
,
who
be
so
bewilder
by
the
scene
that
even
yet
he
do
not
understand
who
the
stranger
be
,
do
not
perceive
for
an
instant
that
he
see
the
realization
of
his
great
dread
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
lay
her
hand
on
Kinraid
's
arm
,
and
assume
to
herself
the
right
of
speech
.
<EOS>
Philip
do
not
know
her
voice
,
it
be
so
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip

"
she
say
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
Philip
know
not
what
to
say
,
whither
to
turn
,
under
what
refuge
of
word
or
act
to
shelter
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
influence
be
keep
Kinraid
silent
,
but
he
be
rapidly
pass
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
loosen
himself
from
Sylvia
's
light
grasp
,
and
come
towards
Philip
,
with
a
threaten
gesture
.
<EOS>
"
do
I
not
bid
you
tell
her
how
it

<EOS>
do
I
not
bid
<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
His
closed
fist
be
up
to
strike
the
man
,
who
hang
his
head
with
bitter
shame
and
miserable
self

reproach
;
but
Sylvia

swift
between
the
blow
and
its
victim

<EOS>
"

He

gesture
of

She
lie
across
a
chair
,
her
arm
helplessly
stretch
out
,
her
face
unseen
.
<EOS>
every
now
and
then
a
thrill
run
through
her
body
:
she
be
talk
to
herself
all
the
time
with
incessant
low
incontinence
of
word
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
stand
near
her
,
motionless
:
he
do
not
know
whether
she
be
conscious
of
his
presence
;
in
fact
,
he
know
nothing
but
that
he
and
she
be
sunder
for
ever
;
he
could
only
take
in
that
one
idea
,
and
it
numb
all

once

She
rise
to

stagger
when
she
try
to
walk
;
her
glaze
eye
fall
upon
Philip
as
he
instinctively
make
a
step
to
hold
her
steady
.
<EOS>
no
light
come
into
her
eye
any
more
than
if
she
have
look
upon
a
perfect
stranger
;
not
even
be
there
the
contraction
of
dislike

<EOS>
some
other
figure
fill
her
mind
,

she
see
him
no

she
see
the
inanimate
table
.
<EOS>
that
way
of
look
at
him
wither
him
up
more
than
any

would
have
do

<EOS>
He
watch
her
laboriously
climb
the
stair
,
and
vanish
out
of
sight
;
and
sit
down
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
extreme
bodily
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
of
communication
between
the
parlour

shop
be
open

<EOS>
that
be
the
first
event

Philip
take
note

Phoebe
have
come
in
unaware
to
him
,
with
the
intention
of
remove
the
breakfast
thing
on

see

come
in

amazed
at
Hepburn

why
should
there
be

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
He
almost
guard
Philip
into
the
shop
,
and
keep
furtively
watch
him
,
and
perplex
himself
with
Philip
's
odd
,
strange
way
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
,
too
,
observe
the
heavy
break
-
down
expression
on
Philip
's
ashen
face
,
and
her
heart
ache
for
him
;
but
after
that
first
glance
,
which
tell
her
so
much
,
she
avoid
all
appearance

only

It
be
market

day

people
come
in

out

bring
their
store

the
landlady
of

house
much
frequent

they

Kinraid

no

set
up

for
all
his
lieutenant

uniform
(
and
eh

<EOS>
but
they
say
he

handsome
in

;
but

<EOS>
all
the
people
in

shop
be
listen
now

Philip
alone
seem
engrossed
in
fold
up
a
piece
of
cloth
,
so
as
to
leave
no

chance

crease

yet
he
lose
not

good

She

please
with

with
fresh

"
  
<EOS>
a
murmur
of
applause
and
interest
and
rejoice
buzz
all
around
Philip
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
publicly
know
about
Kinraid
,
 
and
how
much
more
?
<EOS>
all
Monkshaven
may
hear
tomorrow
 
nay
,
to
-
day
 
of
Philip
's
treachery
to
the
hero
of
the
hour
;
how
he
have
conceal
his
fate
,
and
supplant
him
in
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
shrink
from
the
burst
of
popular
indignation
which
he
know
must
follow
.
<EOS>
any
wrong
do
to
one
who
stand
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
people
's
favour
be
resent
by
each
individual
as
a
personal
injury
;
and
among
a
primitive
set
of
country
-
folk
,
who
recognize
the
wild
passion
in
love
,
as
it
exist
untamed
by
the
trammel
of
reason
and
self
-
restraint
,
any
story
of
baulked
affection
,
or
treachery
in
such
matter
,
spread
like
wildfire
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
know
this
quite
well
;
his
doom
of
disgrace
lie
plain
before
him
,
if
only
Kinraid
speak
the
word
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
bent
down
while
he
thus
listen
and
reflect
.
<EOS>
He
half
resolve
on
do
something
;
he
lift
up
his
head
,
catch
the
reflection
of
his
face
in
the
little
strip
of
glass
on
the
opposite
side
,
in
which
the
woman
may
look
at
themselves
in
their
contemplate
purchase
,
and
quite
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
the
sight
he
see
in
the
mirror
be
his
own
long
,
sad
,
pale
face
,
make
plainer
and
grayer
by
the
heavy
pressure
of
the
morning
's
event
.
<EOS>
He
see
his
stooping
figure
,
his
rounded
shoulder
,
with
something
like
a
feeling
of
disgust
at
his
personal
appearance
as
he
remember
the
square
,
upright
build
of
Kinraid
;
his
fine
uniform
,
with
epaulette
and
sword
-
belt
;
his
handsome
brown
face
;
his
dark
eye
,
splendid
with
the
fire
of
passion
and
indignation
;
his
white
tooth
,
gleam
out
with
the
terrible
smile
of
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
the
comparison
drive
Philip
from
passive
hopelessness
to
active
despair
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
abruptly
from
the
crowded
shop
into
the
empty
parlour
,
and
on
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
take
up
a
piece
of
bread
,
and
heedless
of
Phoebe
's
look
and
word
,
begin
to
eat
it
before
he
even
leave
the
place
;
for
he
need
the
strength
that
food
would
give
;
he
need
it
to
carry
him
out
of
the
sight
and
the
knowledge
of
all
who
may
hear
what
he
have
do
,
and
point
their
finger
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
pause
a
moment
in
the
parlour
,
and
then
,
set
his
tooth
tight
together
,
he
go
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
first
of
all
he
go
into
the
bit
of
a
room
open
out
of
theirs
,
in
which
his
baby
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
dearly
love
the
child
,
and
many
a
time
would
run
in
and
play
a
while
with
it
;
and
in
such
gambol
he
and
Sylvia
have
pass
their
happy
moment
of
wedded
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
Bella
be
have
her
morning
slumber
;
Nancy
use
to
tell
long
afterwards
how
he
kneel
down
by
the
side
of
her
cot
,
and
be
so
strange
<EOS>
she
think
he
must
have
pray
,
for
all
it
be
nigh
upon
eleven
o'clock
,
and
folk
in
their
sense
only
say
their
prayer
when
they
get
up
,
and
when
they
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
rise
,
and
stoop
over
,
and
give
the
child
a
long
,
linger
,
soft
,
fond
kiss
.
<EOS>
and
on
tip
-
toe
he
pass
away
into
the
room
where
his
aunt
lie
;
his
aunt
who
have
be
so
true
a
friend
to
him
!
<EOS>
He
be
thankful
to
know
that
in
her
present
state
she
be
safe
from
the
knowledge
of
what
be
past
,
safe
from
the
sound
of
the
shame
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
mean
to
see
Sylvia
again
;
he
dread
the
look
of
her
hatred
,
her
scorn
,
but
there
,
outside
her
mother
's
bed
,
she
lie
,
apparently
asleep
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
,
too
,
be
sleep
,
her
face
towards
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Philip
could
not
help
it
;
he
go
to
have
one
last
look
at
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
be
turn
towards
her
mother
,
her
face
avert
from
him
;
he
could
see
the
tear
-
stain
,
the
swollen
eyelid
,
the
lip
yet
quiver
:
he
stoop
down
,
and
bent
to
kiss
the
little
hand
that
lie
listless
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
as
his
hot
breath
near
that
hand
it
be
twitch
away
,
and
a
shiver
run
through
the
whole
prostrate
body
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
know
that
she
be
not
asleep
,
only
wear
out
by
her
misery
,
 
misery
that
he
have
cause
.
  
<EOS>
He
sigh
heavily
;
but
he
go
away
,
down
-
stair
,
and
away
for
ever
.
<EOS>
only
as
he
enter
the
parlour
his
eye
catch
on
two
silhouette
,
one
of
himself
,
one
of
Sylvia
,
do
in
the
first
month
of
their
marriage
,
by
some
wander
artist
,
if
so
he
could
be
call
.
<EOS>
They
be
hang
against
the
wall
in
little
oval
wooden
frame
;
black
profile
,
with
the
light
do
in
gold
;
about
as
poor
semblance
of
humanity
as
could
be
conceive
;
but
Philip
go
up
,
and
after
look
for
a
minute
or
so
at
Sylvia
's
,
he
take
it
down
,
and
button
his
waistcoat
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
thing
he
take
away
from
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
down
the
entry
on
to
the
quay
.
<EOS>
the
river
be
there
,
and
water
,
they
say
,
have
a
luring
power
,
and
a
weird
promise
of
rest
in
their
perpetual
monotony
of
sound
.
<EOS>
but
many
people
be
there
,
if
such
a
temptation
present
itself
to
Philip
's
mind
;
the
sight
of
his
fellow
-
townsman
,
perhaps
of
his
acquaintance
,
drive
him
up
another
entry
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
burrow
with
such
 
back
into
the
High
Street
,
<EOS>
which
he
straightway
cross
into
a
well
-
know
court
,
out
of
which
rough
step
lead
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
on
to
the
fell
and
moor
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
He
plunge
and
pant
up
this
rough
ascent
.
<EOS>
from
the
top
he
could
look
down
on
the
whole
town
lie
below
,
sever
by
the
bright
shine
river
into
two
part
.
<EOS>
to
the
right
lie
the
sea
,
shimmer
and
heave
;
there
be
the
cluster
of
mast
rise
out
of
the
little
port
;
the
irregular
roof
of
the
house
;
which
of
them
,
think
he
,
as
he
carry
his
eye
along
the
quay
-
side
to
the
market
-
place
,
which
of
them
be
his
?
<EOS>
and
he
single
it
out
in
its
unfamiliar
aspect
,
and
see
the
thin
blue
smoke
rise
from
the
kitchen
chimney
,
where
even
now
Phoebe
be
cook
the
household
meal
that
he
never
more
must
share
.
  
<EOS>
up
at
that
thought
and
away
,
he
know
not
nor
care
not
whither
.
<EOS>
He
go
through
the
ploughed
field
where
the
corn
be
newly
spring
;
he
come
down
upon
the
vast
sunny
sea
,
and
turn
his
back
upon
it
with
loathing
;
he
make
his
way
inland
to
the
high
green
pasture
;
the
short
upland
turf
above
which
the
lark
hang
poise
"
at
heaven
's
gate
"
.
<EOS>
He
stride
along
,
so
straight
and
heedless
of
briar
and
bush
,
that
the
wild
black
cattle
cease
from
graze
,
and
look
after
him
with
their
great
blank
puzzle
eye
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
pass
all
enclosure
and
stone
fence
now
,
and
be
fairly
on
the
desolate
brown
moor
;
through
the
withered
last
year
's
ling
and
fern
,
through
the
prickly
gorse
,
he
tramp
,
crush
down
the
tender
shoot
of
this
year
's
growth
,
and
heedless
of
the
startled
plover
's
cry
,
goad
by
the
fury
.
<EOS>
His
only
relief
from
thought
,
from
the
remembrance
of
Sylvia
's
look
and
word

be
in
violent
bodily
action
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
till
<EOS>
evening
shadow
and
ruddy
evening
light
come
out
upon
the
wild
fell
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
cross
road
and
lane
,
with
a
bitter
avoidance
of
man
's
track
;
but
now
the
strong
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
come
out
,
and
his
aching
limb
,
his
weary
heart
,
give
great
pant
and
beat
for
a
time
,
and
then
cease
altogether
till
a
mist
swam
and
quiver
before
his
ache
eye
,
warn
him
that
he
must
find
some
shelter
and
food
,
or
lie
down
to
die
.
<EOS>
He
fall
down
now
,
often
;
stumble
over
the
slight
obstacle
.
<EOS>
He
have
pass
the
cattle
pasture
;
he
be
among
the
black
-
face
sheep
;
and
they
,
too
,
cease
nibbling
,
and
look
after
him
,
and
somehow
,
in
his
poor
wander
imagination
,
their
silly
face
turn
to
likeness
of
Monkshaven
people
 
people
who
ought
to
be
far
,
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'll
be
belate
on
these
fell
,
if
thou
do
not
tak
'
heed
,
"
shout
some
one
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
look
abroad
to
see
whence
the
voice
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
an
old
stiff
-
legged
shepherd
,
in
a
smock
-
frock
,
be
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yard
.
<EOS>
Philip
do
not
answer
,
but
staggered
and
stumble
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
lork
!
"
say
the
man
,
"
wheere
hast
ta
be

<EOS>
Thou
's
see
<EOS>
Oud
Harry
,
I
think
,
thou
look
so
scared
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
rally
himself
,
and
try
to
speak
up
to
the
old
standard
of
respectability
;
but
the
effort
be
pitiful
to
see
,
have
any
one
be
by
,
who
could
have
understand
the
pain
it
cause
to
restrain
cry
of
bodily
and
mental
agony
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
lose
my
way
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
'
twould

I

,
if

have
not
come
out

.
<EOS>
there
be
t
'
Three
Griffins
near
at

:
a

will
set
thee
to

.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
follow
faintly
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
before
him
,
and
be
guide
by
the
sound
of
footstep
rather
than
by
the
sight
of
the
figure
move
onwards
.
<EOS>
He
keep
stumble
;
and
he
know
that
the
old
shepherd
swear
at
him
;
but
he
also
know
such
curse
proceed
from
no
ill
-
will
,
only
from
annoyance
at
the
delay
in
going
and
"
seem
"
after
t
'
ewes
.
"
<EOS>
but
have
the
man
's
word
convey
the
utmost
expression
of
hatred
,
Philip
would
neither
have
wonder
at
them
,
nor
resent
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
come
into
a
wild
mountain
road
,
unfence
from
the
fell
.
<EOS>
a
hundred
yard
off
,
and
there
be
a
small
public
-
house
,
with
a
broad
ruddy
oblong
of
firelight
shine
across
the
tract
.
  
<EOS>
"
Theere

say
the

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
,
and
deliver
Philip
safely
up
to
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
here

<EOS>

Philip

sit
down
on

he
come
to

<EOS>
"
I
be
right
enough
;
just
fairly
weary
out

"
and
he
faint
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
recruiting
sergeant
of
marines
sit
in
the
house
-
place
,
drinking
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
like
Philip
,
have
lose
his
way
;
but
be
turn
his
blunder
to
account
by
tell
all
manner
of
wonderful
story
to
two
or
three
rustic
who
have
come
in
ready
to
drink
on
any
pretence
;
especially
if
they
could
get
good
liquor
without
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
sergeant
rise
as
Philip
fall
back
,
and
bring
up
his
own
mug
of
beer
,
into
which
a
noggin
of
gin
have
be
put
(
call
in
Yorkshire
"
dog's

"
)
.
<EOS>
He
partly
pour
and
partly
spilt
some
of
this
beverage
on
Philip
's
face
;
some
drop
go
through
the
pale
and
parted
lip
,
and
with
a
start

<EOS>
"
bring

"
call
out
the
recruiting
sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
stand

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
bring
some
cold
bacon
and
coarse
oat
-
cake
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
ask
for
pepper
and
salt
;
mince
the
food
fine
and
make
it
savoury
,
and
keep
administer
it
by
teaspoonful
;
urge
Philip
to
drink
from
time
to
time
from
his
own
cup
of
dog's
-
nose
.
  
<EOS>
a
burn
thirst
,
which
need
no
stimulant
from
either
pepper
or
salt
,
take
possession
of
Philip
,
and
he
drink
freely
,
scarcely
recognize
what
he
drink
.
<EOS>
It
take
effect
on
one
so
habitually
sober
;
and
he
be
soon
in
that
state
when
the
imagination
work
wildly
and
freely
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
the
sergeant
before
him
,
handsome
,
and
bright
,
and
active
,
in
his
gay
red
uniform
,
without
a
care
,
as
it
seem
to
Philip
,
take
life
lightly
;
admire
and
respect
everywhere
because
of
his
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
if
Philip
be
gay
,
and
brisk
,
well
-
dress
like
him
,
return
with
martial
glory
to
Monkshaven
,
would
not
Sylvia
love
him
once
more
?
<EOS>
Could
not
he
win
her
heart
?
<EOS>
He
be
brave
by
nature
,
and
the
prospect
of
danger
do
not
daunt
him
,
if
ever
it
present
itself
to
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
he
be
cautious
in
enter
on
the
subject
of
enlistment
with
his
new
friend
,
the
sergeant
;
but
the
latter
be
twenty
time
as
cunning
as
he
,
and
know
by
experience
how
to
bait
his
hook
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
old
by
some
year
than
the
regulation
age
;
but
,
at
that
time
of
great
demand
for
man
,
the
question
of
age
be
lightly
entertain
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
be
profuse
in
statement
of
the
advantage
present
to
a
man
of
education
in
his
branch
of
the
service
;
how
such
a
one
be
sure
to
rise
;
in
fact
,
it
would
have
seem
from
the
sergeant
's
account
,
as
though
the
difficulty
consist
in
remain
in
the
rank
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
dizzy
head
think
the
subject
over
and
over
again
,
each
time
with
fail
power
of
reason
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
almost
,
as
it
would
seem
,
by
some
sleight
of
hand
,
he
find
the
fatal
shilling
in
his
palm
,
and
have
promise
to
go
before
the
near
magistrate
to
be
swear
in
as
one
of
his
Majesty
's
marine
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
and
after
that
he
remember
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
waken
up
in
a
little
truckle
-
bed
in
the
same
room
as
the
sergeant
,
who
lie
sleep
the
sleep
of
full
contentment
;
while
gradually
,
drop
by
drop
,
the
bitter
recollection
of
the
day
before
come
,
fill
up
Philip
's
cup
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
receive
the
bounty
-
money
;
and
though
he
be
aware
that
he
have
be
partly
trick
into
it
,
and
have
no
hope
,
no
care
,
indeed
,
for
any
of
the
advantage
so
liberally
promise
him
the
night
before
,
yet
he
be
resign
,
with
utterly
despondent
passiveness
,
to
the
fate
to
which
he
have
pledge
himself
.
<EOS>
anything
be
welcome
that
sever
him
from
his
former
life
,
that
could
make
him
forget
it
,
if
that
be
possible
;
and
also
welcome
anything
which
increase
the
chance
of
death
without
the
sinfulness
of
his
own
participation
in
the
act
.
<EOS>
He
find
in
the
dark
recess
of
his
mind
the
dead
body
of
his
fancy
of
the
previous
night
;
that
he
may
come
home
,
handsome
and
glorious
,
to
win
the
love
that
have
never
be
his
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
only
sigh
over
it
,
and
put
it
aside
out
of
his
sight
 
so
full
of
despair
<EOS>
be
he
.
<EOS>
He
could
eat
no
breakfast
,
though
the
sergeant
order
of
the
good
.
<EOS>
the
latter
keep
watch
his
new
recruit
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
expect
a
remonstrance
,
or
dread
a
sudden
bolt
.
  
<EOS>
but
Philip
walk
with
him
the
two
or
three
mile
in
the
most
submissive
silence
,
never
utter
a
syllable
of
regret
or
repentance
;
and
before
Justice
Cholmley
,
of
Holm
-
Fell
Hall
,
he
be
swear
into
his
Majesty
's
service
,
under
the
name
of
Stephen
Freeman
.
<EOS>
with
a
new
name
,
he
begin
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
the
old

for
ever

UNUTTERABLE
  
<EOS>
after
Philip
have
pass
out
of
the
room
,
Sylvia
lie
perfectly
still
,
from
very
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
sleep
on
,
happily
unconscious
of
all
the
turmoil
that
have
take
place
;
yes
,
happily
,
though
the
heavy
sleep
be
to
end
in
death
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
her
daughter
know
nothing
,
imagine
that
it
be
refresh
slumber
,
instead
of
an
ebbing
of
life
.
<EOS>
both
mother
and
daughter
lie
motionless
till
Phoebe
enter
the
room
to
tell
Sylvia
that
dinner
be
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
then
Sylvia
sate
up
,
and
put
back
her
hair
,
bewilder
and
uncertain
as
to
what
be
to
be
do
next
;
how
she
should
meet
the
husband
to
whom
she
have
discard
all
allegiance
,
repudiate
the
solemn
promise
of
love
and
obedience
which
she
have
vow
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
come
into
the
room
,
with
natural
interest
in
the
invalid
,
scarcely
old
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
t

old
lady

"
<EOS>
ask
she
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
turn
her
head
round
to
look
;
her
mother
have
never
move
,
but
be
breathe
in
a
loud
uncomfortable
manner
,
that
make
her
stoop
over
her
to
see
the
averted
face
more
nearly
.
  
<EOS>
"
phoebe

"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
"

<EOS>
She
look
strange
and
odd
;
her
eye
be
open

but
do
not

<EOS>
phoebe

<EOS>

say
Phoebe
,
climb
stiffly
on
to
the
bed
to
have
a
nearer
view
.
<EOS>
"
hold
her

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
take
her
mother
's
head
and
lay
it
fondly
on
her
breast
,
speak
to
her
and
try
to
rouse
her
;
but
it
be
of
no
avail
:
the
hard
,
stertorous
breathing
grow
bad
and
bad
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
cry
out
for
help
;
Nancy
come
,
the
baby
in
her
arm
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
in
several
time
before
that
morning
;
and
the
child
come
smile
and
crow
at
its
mother
,
who
be

her

die
parent

<EOS>
"

Sylvia

"
what

<EOS>
yo

<EOS>
Nancy
set
the
baby
on
the

for
all

and
run
out
of
the
room
,
cry
out
,
  
"

<EOS>
this
appear
to
be
no
news
to
Sylvia
,
and
yet
the
word
come
on
her
with
a
great
shock
,
but
for
all
that
she
could
not
cry
;
she
be
surprise
herself
at
her
own
deadness
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Her
baby
crawl
to
her
,
and
she
have
to
hold
and
guard
both
her
mother
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
long
,
long
time
before
any

come
,
and
then
she
hear
muffled
voice
,
and
a
heavy
tramp
<EOS>
:
it
be
Phoebe
lead
the
doctor
upstairs
,
and
Nancy
creep
in
behind
to
hear
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
ask
many
question
,
and
Phoebe
reply
more
frequently
to
his
inquiry
than
do
Sylvia
,
who
look
into
his
face
with
a
blank
,
tearless
,
speechless
despair
,
that
give
him
more
pain
than
the
sight
of
her
die
mother
.
  
<EOS>
the
long
decay
of
Mrs.
Robson
's
faculty
and
health
,
of
which
he
be
well
aware
,
have
in
a
certain
manner
prepare
him
for
some
such
sudden
termination
of
the
life
whose
duration
be
hardly
desirable
,
although
he
give
several
direction
as
to
her
treatment
;
but
the
white
,
pinched
face
,
the
great
dilate
eye
,
the
slow
comprehension
of
the
young
woman
,
strike
him
with
alarm
;
and
he
go
on
ask
for
various
particular
,
more
with
a
view
of
rouse
Sylvia
,
if
even
it
be
to

than
for
any
other
purpose
that

terrible
stare
continue
:
he
put
his
advice
into
action
,
and
gently
try
to
loosen
her
clasp

tender

this

suddenly
.
<EOS>
Nancy
have
take
her
up
off
the
bed
where
she
have
be
sit
,
encircle
by
her
mother
's
arm
.
<EOS>
the
nursemaid
give
her
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
watch
the
mother
's
eye
,
it
follow
her
child
,
and
he
be
rejoice
.
<EOS>
He
give
a
little
pinch
to
the
baby
's
soft
flesh
,
and
she
cry
out
piteously
;
again
the
same
action
,
the
same
result
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
lay
her
mother
down
,
and
stretch
out
her
arm
for
her
child
,
hush
it
,
and
moan
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
far
so
good
!
"
say
Dr
Morgan
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
but
where
be
the
husband
?
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
go
down
-
stair
to
make
inquiry
for
Philip
;
that
poor
young
creature
,
about
whose
health
he
have
never
feel
thoroughly
satisfied
since
the
fever
after
her
confinement
,
be
in
an
anxious
condition
,
and
with
an
inevitable
shock
await
her
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
ought
to
be
with
her
,
and
support
her
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Morgan
go
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Hester
alone
be
there
.
<EOS>
Coulson
have
go
to
his
comfortable
dinner
at
his
well
-
order
house
,
with
his
common
-
place
wife
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
feel
anxious
about
Philip
's
look
and
strange
disappearance
,
he
have
also
manage
to
account
for
them
in
some
indifferent
way
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
be
alone
with
the
shop
-
boy
;
few
people
come
in
during
the
universal
Monkshaven
dinner
-
hour
.
<EOS>
She
be
rest
her
head
on
her
hand
,
and
puzzle
and
distress
about
many
thing
 
<EOS>
all
that
be
imply
by
the
proceeding
of
the
evening
before
between
Philip
and
Sylvia
;
and
that
be
confirm
by
Philip
's
miserable
look
and
strange
abstract
way
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
easy
Hester
would
have
find
it
to
make
him
happy
!
<EOS>
not
merely
how
easy
,
but
what
happiness
it
would
have
be
to
her
to
merge
her
every
wish
into
the
one
great
object
of
fulfil
his
will
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
an
on
-
looker
,
the
course
of
married
life
,
which
should
lead
to
perfect
happiness
,
seem
to
plain
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
often
so
!
<EOS>
and
the
resist
force
which
make
all
such
harmony
and
delight
impossible
be
not
recognize
by
the
bystander
,
hardly
by
the
actor
.
<EOS>
but
if
these
resist
force
be
only
superficial
,
or
constitutional
,
they
be
but
the
necessary
discipline
here
,
and
do
not
radically
affect
the
love
which
will
make
all
thing
right
in
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
some
glimmering
of
this
latter
comforting
truth
shed
its
light
on
Hester
's
trouble
thought
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
but
again
,
how
easy
would
it
have
be
to
her
to
tread
the
maze
that
lead
to
Philip
's
happiness
;
and
how
difficult
it
seem
to
the
wife
he
have
choose
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
arouse
by
Dr
Morgan
's
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
both
Coulson
and
Hepburn
have
leave
the
shop
to
your
care
,
Hester
.
<EOS>
I
want
Hepburn
,
though
;
his
wife
be
in
a
very
anxious
state
.
<EOS>
where
be
he
?
<EOS>
can
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
in
an
anxious
state
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
her
to
-
day
,
but
last
night
she
look
as
well
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
;
<EOS>
but
many
a
thing
happen
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
die
,
may
be
dead
by
this
time
;
and
her
husband
should
be
there
with
her
.
<EOS>
can
not
you
send
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
where
he
be
,
"
say
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
go
off
from
here
all
on
a
sudden
,
when
there
be
all
the
market
-
folk
in
t
'
shop
;
I
think
he
would
maybe
go
to
John
Foster
be
about
th
'
money
,
for
they
be
pay
a
deal
in
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
there
and
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
the
messenger
bring
back
word
that
he
have
not
be
see
at
their
bank
all
morning
.
<EOS>
further
inquiry
be
make
by
the
anxious
Hester
,
by
the
doctor
,
by
Coulson
;
all
they
could
learn
be
that
Phoebe
have
see
him
pass
the
kitchen
window
about
eleven
o'clock
,
when
she
be
peel
the
potato
for
dinner
;
and
<EOS>
two
lad
play
on
the
quay
-
side
think
they
have
see
him
among
a
group
of
sailor
;
but
these
latter
,
as
far
as
they
could
be
identify
,
have
no
knowledge
of
his
appearance
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
before
night
the
whole
town
be
excited
about
his
disappearance
.
<EOS>
before
night
Bell
Robson
have
go
to
her
long
home
.
<EOS>
and
Sylvia
still
lie
quiet
and
tearless
,
apparently
more
unmoved
than
any
other
creature
by
the
event
of
the
day
,
and
the
strange
vanishing
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
thing
she
seem
to
care
for
be
her
baby
;
she
hold
it
tight
in
her
arm
,
and
Dr
Morgan
bid
them
leave
it
there
<EOS>
,
its
touch
may
draw
the
desire
tear
into
her
weary
,
sleepless
eye
,
and
charm
the
ache
pain
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
afraid
lest
she
should
inquire
for
her
husband
,
whose
non
-
appearance
at
such
a
time
of
sorrow
to
his
wife
<EOS>
must
(
they
think
)
seem
strange
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
night
draw
on
while
they
be
all
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
back
to
her
own
room
without
a
word
when
they
have
desire
her
to
do
so
;
caress
her
child
in
her
arm
,
and
sit
down
on
the
first
chair
she
come
to
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
as
if
even
this
slight
bodily
exertion
have
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
They
see
her
eye
turn
towards
the
door
every
time
it
be
open
,
and
they
think
it
be
with
anxious
expectation
of
one
who
could
not
be
find
,
though
many
be
seek
for
him
in
all
probable
place
.
  
<EOS>
when
night
come
some
one
have
to
tell
her
of
her
husband
's
disappearance
;
and
Dr
Morgan
be
the
person
who
undertake
this
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
into
her
room
about
nine
o'clock
;
her
baby
be
sleep
in
her
arm
;
she
herself
pale
as
death
,
still
silent
and
tearless
,
though
strangely
watchful
of
gesture
and
sound
,
and
probably
cognizant
of
more
than
they
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mrs.
Hepburn
,
"
say
he
,
as
cheerfully
as
he
could
,
"
I
should
advise
your
go
to
bed
early
;
for
I
fancy
<EOS>
your
husband
will
not
come
home
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
some
journey
or
other
,
that
perhaps
Coulson
can
explain
well
than
I
can
,
will
most
likely
keep
him
away
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
unfortunate
that
he
should
be
away
at
such
a
sad
time
as
this
,
as
I
be
sure
he
will
feel
when
he
return
;
but
we
must
make
the
good
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
watch
her
to
see
the
effect
of
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
He
still
remain
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
She
lift
her
head
up
a
little
and
ask
,
  
"
how
long
do
yo
'
think
she
be
unconscious
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
Could
she
hear
thing
,
think
yo
'
,
<EOS>
afore
she
fall
into
that
strange
kind
o
'
slumber
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
say
he
,
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
be
she
breathe
in
that
hard
snore
kind
of
way
when
you
leave
her
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
so
;
I
can
not
tell
,
so
much
have
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
come
back
to
her
,
after
your
breakfast
,
I
think
you
say
she
be
in
much
the
same
position
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
yet
I
may
be
tell
yo
'
lie
;
if
I
could
but
think
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
my
head
as
be
ache
so
;
doctor
,
I
wish
yo'd
go
,
for
I
need
be
alone
,
I
be
so
mazed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
good
-
night
,
then
,
for
you
be
a
wise
woman
,
I
see
,
and
mean
to
go
to
bed
,
and
have
a
good
night
with
baby
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
go
down
to
Phoebe
,
and
tell
her
to
go
in
from
time
to
time
,
and
see
how
her
mistress
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
Hester
Rose
and
the
old
servant
together
;
both
have
be
cry
,
both
be
evidently
in
great
trouble
about
the
death
and
the
mystery
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
ask
if
she
may
go
up
and
see
Sylvia
,
and
the
doctor
give
his
leave
,
talk
meanwhile
with
Phoebe
over
the
kitchen
fire
.
<EOS>
Hester
come
down
again
without
see
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
room
be
bolt
,
and
everything
quiet
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
know
where
her
husband
be
,
think
you
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
doctor
at
this
account
of
Hester
's
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
anxious
about
him
at
any
rate
:
or
else
the
shock
of
her
mother
's
death
have
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
We
must
hope
for
some
change
in
the
morning
;
a
good
fit
of
crying
,
or
a
fidget
about
her
husband
,
would
be
more
natural
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
to
you
both
,
"
and
off
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
and
Hester
avoid
look
at
each
other
at
these
word
.
<EOS>
both
be
conscious
of
the
probability
of
something
have
go
seriously
wrong
between
the
husband
and
wife
.
<EOS>
Hester
have
the
recollection
of
the
previous
night
,
Phoebe
the
untasted
breakfast
of
to
-
day
to
go
upon
.
  
<EOS>
She
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
a

"
It

very
late

<EOS>
"
hark
!
<EOS>
be
not
that
a
step

say
Hester
suddenly
,
as
a
footfall
sound
in
the
now
quiet
street
;
but
it
pass
the
door
,
and
the
hope
that
have
arise
on
its
approach
fall
as
the
sound
die
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
noane

"
say
Phoebe
,
who
have
be
as
eager
a
listener
as
Hester
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
thou'd
best
go
thy
way
home

a
shall
stay
up

for
it
be
not

a

go
to

an

a

in

well
on
to
eleven
.

I
will
let
thee
out
by
t
'
shop
-
door
,
and
stand
by
it
till
thou
's
close
at
home
,
for
it
be
ill
for
a
young
woman
to
be
i
'
t
'
street
so
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
hold
the
door
open
,
and
shade
the
candle
from
the
flicker
outer
air
,
while
Hester
go
to
her
home
with
a
heavy
heart
.
  
<EOS>
heavily
and
hopelessly
do
they
all
meet
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
no
news
of
Philip
,
no
change
in
Sylvia
;
an
unceasing
flow
of
angling
and
conjecture
and
gossip
radiate
from
the
shop
into
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
could
have
entreat
Coulson
on
her
knee
to
cease
from
repeat
the
detail
of
a
story
of
which
every
word
touch
on
a
raw
place
in
her
sensitive
heart
;
moreover
,
when
they
talk
together
so
eagerly
,
she
could
not
hear
the
come
footstep
on
the
pavement
without
.
  
<EOS>
once
some
one
hit
very
near
the
truth
in
a
chance
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
strange
,
"
she
say
,
"
how
as
one
man
turn
up
,
another
just
disappear
.
<EOS>
why
,
it
be
but
upo
'
Tuesday
as
Kinraid
come
back
,
as
all
his

folk
have
think
to

day
here

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be

way

i

this

"
reply
Coulson
,
a
little
sententiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
life
be
full
o

change
o

one
kind

another
;
them
that

alive

and
as
for
poor
Philip
,
though
he
be
alive
,
he
look
fitter
to
be
dead
when
he
come
into
t
'
shop
o
'
Wednesday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
she
take
it
?
"
<EOS>
nod
to
where
Sylvia
be
suppose
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
she
be
not
herself
,
so
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
stun
by
find
her
mother
be
die
in
her
very
arm
when
she
think
as
she
be
only
sleep
;
yet
she
be
never
be
able
to
cry
a
drop

so
that

go
inward
on
her

<EOS>
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
,
Sylvia
,
who
have
never
leave
her
room
since
the
night
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
be
suppose
to
be
almost
unconscious
of
all
that
be
go
on
in
the
house
,
declare
her
intention
of
follow
her
mother
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
no
one
could
do
more
than
remonstrate
:
no
one
have
sufficient
authority
to
interfere
with
her
.
<EOS>
Dr
Morgan
even
think
that
she
may
possibly
be
rouse
to
tear
by
the
occasion
;
only
he
beg
Hester
to
go
with
her
,
that
she
may
have
the
solace
of
some
woman
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
through
the
great
part
of
the
ceremony
in
the
same
hard
,
unmoved
manner
in
which
she
have
receive
everything
for
day
past
.
  
<EOS>
but
on
look
up
once
,
as
they
form
round
the
open
grave
<EOS>
,
she
see
Kester
,
in
his
Sunday
clothe
,
with
a
bit
of
new
crape
round
his
hat
,
cry
as
if
his
heart
would
break
over
the
coffin
of
his
good
,
kind
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
His
evident
distress
,
the
unexpected
sight
,
suddenly
loose
the
fountain
of
Sylvia
's
tear
,
and
her
sobs
grow
so
terrible
that
Hester
fear
she
would
not
be
able
to
remain
until
the
end
of
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
but
she
struggle
hard
to
stay
till
the
last
,
and
then
she
make
an
effort
to
go
round
by
the
place
where
Kester
stand
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
and
see
me
,
"
be
all
she
could
say
for

and
Kester
only
nod
his

could
not
speak
a

She
whisper
soft

<EOS>

three

after

miserable
date
of
Bell

death
and
Philip

disappearance

Hester

a
letter
from
him

<EOS>
She
know
the
writing
on
the
address
well
;
and
it
make
her
tremble
so
much
that
it
be
many
minute
before
she
dare
to
open
it
,
and
make
herself
acquaint
with
the
fact
it
may
disclose
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
nee
not
have
fear
;
there
be
no
fact

,
unless
the
vague
date
of
"
London
"
may
be
something
to
learn
.
<EOS>
even
that
much
may
have
be
find
out
by
the
post

mark
,
only
she
have
be
too
much
take
by
surprise
to
examine
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
run
as
follow
:
     
<EOS>
"
DEAR
HESTER
,
    
"
tell
those
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
I
have
leave
Monkshaven

<EOS>
no

need
trouble
themselves
about
me
;

<EOS>
please
to
make
my
humble
apology
to
my
kind

,
the
Messrs

and
to
my
partner

William

<EOS>
please

my

join
the
same
to
your

<EOS>
please
to
give
my
particular
and
respectful
duty
and
kind
love
to
my
aunt
Isabella

<EOS>
Her
daughter
Sylvia
know
what
I
have
always
feel
,
and
shall
always
feel
,
for
her
well
than
I
can
ever
put
into
language
,
so
I
send
her
no
message

God
bless
and
keep
my
child
.
<EOS>
You
must
all
look
on
me
as
one
dead
;
as
I
be
to
you
,
and
maybe
shall
soon
be
in
reality
.

<EOS>
for
God

and
mine

look
after
(

my

out
)
Sylvia
and
my
child

<EOS>
I
think
Jeremiah
Foster
will
help
you
to
be
a
friend
to
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
solemn
request
of
<EOS>
P.
H.
She
be
but
very
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hester
read
this
letter
again
and
again
,
till
her
heart
catch
the
echo
of
its
hopelessness
,
and
sink
within
her
.
<EOS>
She
put
it
in
her
pocket
,
and
reflect
upon
it
all
the
day
long
as
she
serve
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
the
customer
find
her
as
gentle
,
but
far
more
inattentive
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
in
the
evening
she
would
go
across
the
bridge
,
and
consult
with
the
two
good
old
brother
Foster
.
<EOS>
but
something
occur
to
put
off
the
fulfilment
of
this
plan
.
  
<EOS>
that
same
morning
Sylvia
have
precede
her
,
with
no
one
to
consult
,
because
consultation
would
have
require
previous
confidence
,
and
confidence
would
have
necessitate
such
a
confession
about
Kinraid
as
it
be
most
difficult
for
Sylvia
to
make
.
<EOS>
the
poor
young
wife
yet
feel
that
some
step
must
be
take
by
her
;
and
what
it
be
to
be
<EOS>
she
could
not
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
home
to
go
to
;
for
as
Philip
be
go
away
,
she
remain
where
she
be
only
on
sufferance
;
she
do
not
know
what
mean
of
livelihood
she
have
;
she
be
willing
to
work
,
<EOS>
nay
,
would
be
thankful
to
take
up
her
old
life
of
country
labour
;
but
with
her
baby
,
what
could
she
do
?
  
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
the
recollection
of
the
old
man
's
kindly
speech
and
offer
of
assistance
,
make
,
it
be
true
,
half
in
joke
,
at
the
end
of
her
wedding
visit
,
come
into
her
mind
;
and
she
resolve
to
go
and
ask
for
some
of
the
friendly
counsel
and
assistance
then
offer
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
first
time
of
her
go
out
since
her
mother
's
funeral
,
and
she
dread
the
effort
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
more
even
than
on
that
account
do
she
shrink
from
go
into
the
street
again
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
get
over
the
impression
that
Kinraid
must
be
linger
near
;
and
she
distrust
herself
so
much
that
it
be
a
positive
terror
to
think
of
meet
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
feel
as
though
,
if
she
but
catch
a
sight
of
him
,
the
glitter
of
his
uniform
,
or
hear
his
well
-
know
voice
in
only
a
distant
syllable
of
talk
,
her
heart
would
stop
,
and
she
should
die
from
very
fright
of
what
would
come
next
.
<EOS>
or
rather
so
she
feel
,
and
<EOS>
so
she
think
before
she
take
her
baby
in
her
arm
,
as
Nancy
give
it
to
her
after
put
on
its
out
-
of
-
door
attire
.
  
<EOS>
with
it
in
her
arm
she
be
protect
,
and
the
whole
current
of
her
thought
be
change
.
<EOS>
the
infant
be
wail
and
suffer
with
its
teething
,
and
the
mother
's
heart
be
so
occupied
in
soothe
and
console
her
moan
child
,
that
the
dangerous
quay
-
side
and
the
bridge
be
pass
almost
before
she
be
aware
;
nor
do
she
notice
the
eager
curiosity
and
respectful
attention
of
those
she
meet
who
recognize
her
even
through
the
heavy
veil
which
form
part
of
the
draping
mourning
provide
for
her
by
Hester
and
Coulson
,
in
the
first
unconscious
day
after
her
mother
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
though
public
opinion
as
yet
reserve
its
verdict
upon
Philip
's
disappearance
 
warn
possibly
by
Kinraid
's
story
against
hasty
decision
and
judgment
in
such
time
as
those
of
war
and
general
disturbance
 
yet
every
one
agree
that
no
more
pitiful
fate
could
have
befall
Philip
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
mark
out
by
her
striking
beauty
as
an
object
of
admire
interest
even
in
those
day
when
she
sate
in
girlhood
's
smile
peace
by
her
mother
at
the
Market
Cross
 
<EOS>
her
father
have
lose
his
life
in
a
popular
cause
,
and
ignominious
as
the
manner
of
his
death
may
be
,
he
be
look
upon
as
a
martyr
to
his
zeal
in
avenge
the
wrong
of
his
townsman
;
Sylvia
have
marry
amongst
them
too
,
and
her
quiet
daily
life
be
well
known
to
them
;
and
now
her
husband
have
be
carry
off
from
her
side
just
on
the
very
day
when
she
need
his
comfort
most
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
general
opinion
be
that
Philip
have
be
"
carry
off
"
 
in
seaport
town
such
occurrence
be
not
uncommon
in
those
day
 
either
by
land
-
crimp
or
water
-
crimp
.
  
<EOS>
so
Sylvia
be
treat
with
silent
reverence
,
as
one
sorely
afflict
,
by
all
the
unheeded
people
she
meet
in
her
falter
walk
to
Jeremiah
Foster
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
calculate
her
time
so
as
to
fall
in
with
him
at
his
dinner
hour
,
even
though
it
oblige
her
to
go
to
his
own
house
rather
than
to
the
bank
where
he
and
his
brother
spend
all
the
business
hour
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
so
nearly
exhaust
by
the
length
of
her
walk
and
the
weight
of
her
baby
,
that
all
she
could
do
when
the
door
be
open
be
to
totter
into
the
near
seat
,
sit
down
,
and
begin
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
in
an
instant
kind
hand
be
about
her
,
loosen
her
heavy
cloak
,
offer
to
relieve
her
of
her
child
,
who
cling
to
her
all
the
more
firmly
,
and
some
one
be
press
a
glass
of
wine
against
her
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
I
can
not
take
it
!
<EOS>
wine
allays
give
me
th
'
headache
;
if
I
may
have
just
a
drink
o

water

<EOS>
thank
you
,
madam
"
(
to
the
respectable
-
look
old
servant
)
,
"
I
be
well
enough
now
;
and
perhaps
,
sir
,
I
may
speak
a
word
with
yo
'
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
that
I
have
come
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
,
Sylvia
Hepburn
,
as
thee
didst
not
come
to
me
at
the
bank
,
for
it
be
be
a
long
toil
for
thee
all
this
way
in
the
heat
,
with
thy
child
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
aught
I
can
do
or
say
for
thee
,
thou
hast
but
to
name
it
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Martha
!
<EOS>
wilt
thou
relieve
her
of
her
child
while
she
come
with
me
into
the
parlour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
wilful
little
Bella
stoutly
refuse
to
go
to
any
one
,
and
Sylvia
be
not
willing
to
part
with
her
,
tired
though
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
baby
be
carry
into
the
parlour
,
and
much
of
her
after
-
life
depend
on
this
trivial
fact
.
  
<EOS>
once
instal
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
face
to
face
with
Jeremiah
,
Sylvia
do
not
know
how
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
see
this
,
and
kindly
give
her
time
to
recover
herself
,
by
pull
out
his
great
gold
watch
,
and
let
the
seal
dangle
before
the
child
's
eye
,
almost
within
reach
of
the
child
's
eager
little
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
favour
you
a
deal
,
"
say
he
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
More
than
her
father
,
"
he
go
on
,
purposely
introduce
Philip
's
name
,
so
as
to
break
the
ice
;
for
he
rightly
conjecture
she
have
come
to
speak
to
him
about
something
connect
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
still
Sylvia
say
nothing
;
she
be
choke
down
tear
and
shyness
,
and
unwillingness
to
take
as
confidant
a
man
of
whom
she
know
so
little
,
on
such
slight
ground
<EOS>
(
as
she
now
feel
it
to
be
)
<EOS>
as
the
little
kindly
speech
with
which
she
have
be
dismiss
from
that
house
the
last
time
that
she
enter
it

Jeremiah

hastily
put

another

dance

tantalized

again
a
long
pause
of
silent
recollection

break
by
one
or
two
deep
sigh

<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
look
in
her
face
,
and
see
the
wistful
,
eager
look
,
he
be
touch
almost
against
his
judgment
into
give
the
promise

;
she
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
a
Tuesday
morning
,
three
week
ago
,
I
think
,
tho

matter
<EOS>
o

time

it
may
ha

be
three

come
back
for

<EOS>
claim
me
as
his

,
and
I
be
we
would
to
Philip
!
<EOS>
I
meet
him
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
road
at
first
;
<EOS>
and
I
could
not
tell
him
theere
.
<EOS>
He
follow
me
into
t
'
house
 
Philip
's
house
,
sir
,
behind
t
'
shop
 
and
somehow
I
tell
him
all
,
how
I
be
a
wed
wife
to
another
.
<EOS>
then
he
up
and
say
I
would
a
false
heart
 
me
<EOS>
false
,
sir
,
as
have
eat
my
daily
bread
in
bitterness
,
and
have
weep
t
'
night
through
,
all
for
sorrow
and
mourn
for
his
death
!
<EOS>
then
he
say
as
Philip
know
all
t
'
time
he
be
alive
and
come
back
for
me
;
and
I
could
not
believe
it
,
and
I
call
Philip
,
and
he
come
,
and
a
'
that
Charley
have
say
be
true
;
and
yet
I
be
Philip
's
wife
!
<EOS>
so
I
take
a
mighty
oath
,
and
I
say
as
I
would
niver
hold
Philip
to
be
my
lawful
husband
again
,
nor
iver
forgive
him
for
t

evil
<EOS>
he
would
work
us
,

hold
him
as
a
stranger

do
me
a
heavy
wrong

"
  
<EOS>
She
stop
speak
;
her
story
seem
to
her
to
end
there
.
<EOS>
but
her
listener
say
,
after
a
pause
,
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
cruel
wrong

I
grant
thee
that
;

go
to

<EOS>
She
be
asleep
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
so
I
lie
down
by
her
,
to
wish
I

and
to
think
on
what
would
come
on
my
child
if
I
die
;
and
Philip
come
in
softly
,
and
I
make
as

groan
as

end
her
story

<EOS>
then
he
pull
himself
up
,
and
say
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
of
voice
,
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
come

<EOS>
"
I

say
she

Jeremiah
have
never

with
any

so
frank

undisguised
in
expression
of
wrong

he
scarcely

He
look
extremely
grieved

so
pretty

delicate

She
seem
to

his

She

her
tear

the
child
begin
to
cry
too
,
stretch

once
more

the
temptation

the
watch

chain

think
for
a
while
before

then
she

this
acquiescence

be
perfectly
honest
on

almost
take
Sylvia
by
surprise

<EOS>
why
may
she
not
hate
one
who
have
be
both
cruel
and
base
in
his
treatment
of
her

<EOS>
and
yet
she
recoil
from
the
application
of
such
hard
term
by
another
to
Philip
,
by
a
cool

judge
and
indifferent
person

as
she
esteem
Jeremiah
to
be

<EOS>
from
some
inscrutable
turn
in
her
thought

she
begin
to
defend
him

at

to
palliate
the
harsh
judgment

she
herself
have

swiftly
change

the
end

be
that

Hester

indisposition
from

letter
to

to
hold
a
consultation
with

over
its
content

and
the
long
day
which
she
have
to
spend
alone
tell
much
upon
her
spirit
,
and
consequently
upon
her
health
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
come
out
in
the
conversation
which
ensue
after
read
Hepburn

letter
in
the
little
parlour
at
the
bank
on
the
day
after
Sylvia
have
have
her
confidential
interview
with
Jeremiah
Foster
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
true
man
of
honour
,
and
never
so
much
as
allude
to
her
visit
to
him
;
but
what
she
have
then
tell
him
influence
him
very
much
in
the
formation
of
the
project
which
he
propose
to
his
brother

Hester
.
  
<EOS>
He
recommend
her
remain
where
she
be
,
live
still
in
the
house
behind
the
shop
;
for
he
think
within
himself
that
she
may
have
exaggerate
the
effect
of
her
word
upon
Philip
;
that
,
after
all
,
it
may
have
be
some
cause
totally
disconnect
with
them
,
which
have
blot
out
her
husband
's
place
among
the
man
of
Monkshaven
;
and
that
it
would
be
so
much
easy
for
both
to
resume
their
natural
relation
,
both
towards
each
other
and
towards
the
world
,
if
Sylvia
remain
where
her
husband
have
leave
her
 
in
an
expectant
attitude
,
so
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah

Hester
straitly
about
her
letter

whether
she
have
make
know
its
content
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
neither
to
her
mother
nor
to
William
Coulson
?
<EOS>
no
,
to
neither
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
as
she
reply
to
his
inquiry
,
and
he
look
at
her
,
each
wonder
if
the
other
could
be
in
the
least
<EOS>
aware
that
a
conjugal
quarrel
may
be
at
the
root
of
the
dilemma
in
which
they
be
place
by
Hepburn
's
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
but
neither
Hester
,
who
have
witness
the
misunderstanding
between
the
husband

the
evening
,
before
the
morning
on
which
Philip

away

nor
Jeremiah
Foster

who
have
learn
from
Sylvia
the
true
reason
of
her
husband
's
disappearance

give
the
slight
reason
to
the
other
to
think
that
they
each
suppose
they
have
a
clue
to
the
reason
of
Hepburn
's
sudden
departure
.
  
<EOS>
what
Jeremiah
Foster
,
after
a
night
's
consideration
,
have
to
propose
be
this
;
that
Hester
and
her
mother
should
come
and
occupy
the
house
in
the
market
-
place
,
conjointly
with
Sylvia
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
Hester
's
interest
in
the
shop
be
by
this
time
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
have
make
over
to
her
so
much
of
his
share
in
the
business
,
that
she
have
a
right
to
be
consider
as
a
kind
of
partner
;
and
she
have
long
be
the
superintendent
of
that
department
of
good
which
be
exclusively
devote
to
woman
.
<EOS>
so
her
daily
presence
be
requisite
for
more
reason
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
yet
her
mother
's
health
and
spirit
be
such
as
to
render
it
unadvisable
that
the
old
woman
should
be
too
much
leave
alone
;
and
Sylvia
's
devotion
to
her
own
mother
seem
to
point
her
out
as
the
very
person
who
could
be
a
gentle
and
tender
companion
to
Alice
Rose
during
those
hour
when
her
own
daughter
would
necessarily
be
engage
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
many
desirable
object
seem
to
be
gain
by
this
removal
of
Alice
:
an
occupation
be
provide
for
Sylvia
,
which
would
detain
her
in
the
place
where
her
husband
have
leave
her
,
and
where
(
Jeremiah
Foster
fairly
expect
in
spite
of
his
letter
)
<EOS>
he
be
likely
to
come
back
to
find
her
;
and
Alice
Rose
,
the
early
love
of
one
of
the
brother
,
the
old
friend
of
the
other
,
would
be
well
care
for
,
and
under
her
daughter
's
immediate
supervision
during
the
whole
of
the
time
that
she
be
occupy
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
share
of
the
business
,
augment
by
the
money
which
he
have
put
in
from
the
legacy
of
his
old
Cumberland
uncle
,
would
bring
in
profit
enough
to
support
Sylvia
and
her
child
in
ease
and
comfort
until
that
time
,
which
they
all
anticipate
,
when
he
should
return
from
his
mysterious
wander
 
mysterious
,
whether
his
go
forth
have
be
voluntary
or
involuntary
.
  
<EOS>
thus
far
be
settle
;
and
Jeremiah
Foster
go
to
tell
Sylvia
of
the
plan
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
too
much
a
child
,
too
entirely
unaccustomed
to
any
independence
of
action
,
to
do
anything
but
leave
herself
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
very
confession
,
make
to
him
the
day
before
,
when
she
seek
his
counsel
,
seem
to
place
her
at
his
disposal
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
she
have
have
notion
of
the
possibility
of
a
free
country
life
once
more
 
<EOS>
how
provide
for
and
arrange
she
hardly
know
;
but
Haytersbank
be
to
let
,
and
Kester
disengage
,
and
it
have
just
seem
possible
that
she
may
have
to
return
to
her
early
home
,
and
to
her
old
life
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
it
would
take
much
money
to
stock
the
farm
again
,
and
that
her
hand
be
tie
from
much
useful
activity
by
the
love
and
care
she
owe
to
her
baby
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
somehow
,
she
hope
and
she
fancy
,
till
Jeremiah
Foster
's
measure
word
and
carefully
-
arrange
plan
make
her
silently
relinquish
her
green
,
breezy
vision
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
,
too
,
have
her
own
private
rebellion
 
hush
into
submission
by
her
gentle
piety
.
<EOS>
if
Sylvia
have
be
able
to
make
Philip
happy
,
Hester
could
have
feel
lovingly
and
almost
gratefully
towards
her
;
but
Sylvia
have
fail
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
be
make
unhappy
,
and
be
drive
forth
a
wanderer
into
the
wide
world
 
never
to
come
back
!
<EOS>
and
his
last
word
to
Hester
,
the
postscript
of
his
letter
,
contain
the
very
pith
of
it
,
be
to
ask
her
to
take
charge
and
care
of
the
wife
whose
want
of
love
towards
him
have
uproot
him
from
the
place
where
he
be
value
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
It
cost
Hester
many
a
struggle
and
many
a
self
-
reproach
before
she
could
make
herself
feel
what
she
see
all
along
 
that
in
everything
Philip
treat
her
like
a
sister
.
<EOS>
but
even
a
sister
may
well
be
indignant
if
she
see
her
brother
's
love
disregard
and
slight
,
and
his
life
embitter
by
the
thoughtless
conduct
of
a
wife
!
<EOS>
still
Hester
fight
against
herself
,
and
for
Philip
's
sake
she
seek
to
see
the
good
in
Sylvia
,
and
she
strove
to
love
her
as
well
as
to
take
care
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
baby
,
of
course
,
the
case
be
different
.
<EOS>
without
thought
or
struggle
,
or
reason
,
every
one
love
the
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Coulson
and
his
buxom
wife
,
who
be
childless
,
be
never
weary
of
make
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
Hester
's
happy
hour
be
spend
with
that
little
child
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
almost
look
upon
her
as
his
own
from
the
day
when
she
honour
him
by
yield
to
the
temptation
of
the
chain
and
seal
,
and
come
to
his
knee
;
not
a
customer
to
the
shop
but
know
the
smile
child
's
sad
history
,
and
many
a
country
-
woman
would
save
a
rosy
-
cheek
apple
from
out
her
store
that
autumn
to
bring
it
on
next
market
-
day
for
"
Philip
Hepburn
's
baby
,
as
have
lose
its
father
,
bless
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
even
stern
Alice
Rose
be
graciously
incline
towards
the
little
Bella
;
and
though
her
idea
of
the
number
of
the
elect
be
grow
narrow
and
narrower
every
day
,
she
would
have
be
loth
to
exclude
the
innocent
little
child
,
that
stroke
her
wrinkle
cheek
so
softly
every
night
in
return
for
her
blessing
,
from
the
few
that
should
be
save
.
<EOS>
nay
,
for
the
child
's
sake
,
she
relent
towards
the
mother
;
and
strove
to
have
Sylvia
rescue
from
the
many
castaway
with
fervent
prayer
,
or
,
as
she
phrase
it
,
"
wrestle
with
the
Lord
"
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
a
sort
of
instinct
that
the
little
child
,
so
tenderly
love
by
,
so
fondly
love
,
the
mother
whose
ewe
-
lamb
<EOS>
she
be
,
could
not
be
even
in
heaven
without
yearn
for
the
creature
she
have
love
best
on
earth
;
and
the
old
woman
believe
that
this
be
the
principal
reason
for
her
prayer
for
Sylvia
;
but
unconsciously
to
herself
,
Alice
Rose
be
touch
by
the
filial
attention
she
constantly
receive
from
the
young
mother
,
whom
she
believe
to
be
foredoom
to
condemnation
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
rarely
go
to
church
or
chapel
,
nor
do
she
read
her
Bible
;
for
though
she
speak
little
of
her
ignorance
,
and
would
fain
,
for
her
child
's
sake
,
have
remedie
it
now
<EOS>
it
be
too
late
,
she
have
lose
what
little
fluency
of
read
she
have
ever
have
,
and
could
only
make
out
her
word
with
much
spelling
and
difficulty
.
<EOS>
so
the
take
her
Bible
in
hand
would
have
be
a
mere
form
;
though
of
this
Alice
Rose
know
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
know
much
of
what
be
pass
in
Sylvia
;
she
do
not
know
herself
.
<EOS>
sometimes
in
the
night
she
would
waken
,
cry
,
with
a
terrible
sense
of
desolation
;
every
one
who
love
her
,
or
whom
she
have
love
,
have
vanish
out
of
her
life
;
every
one
but
her
child
,
who
lie
in
her
arm
,
warm
and
soft
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
Jeremiah
Foster
's
word
come
upon
her
;
<EOS>
word
that
she
have
take
for
cursing
at
the
time
;
and
she
would
so
gladly
have
have
some
clue
by
which
to
penetrate
the
darkness
of
the
unknown
region
from
whence
both
blessing
and
cursing
come
,
and
to
know
if
she
have
indeed
do
something
which
should
cause
her
sin
to
be
visit
on
that
soft
,
sweet
,
innocent
darling
.
  
<EOS>
if
any
one
would
teach
her
to
read
!
<EOS>
if
any
one
would
explain
to
her
the
hard
word
she
hear
in
church
or
chapel
,
so
that
she
may
find
out
the
meaning
of
sin
and
godliness
!
 
<EOS>
word
that
have
only
pass
over
the
surface
of
her
mind
till
now
!
<EOS>
for
her
child
's
sake
she
should
like
to
do
the
will
of
God
,
if
she
only
know
what
that
be
,
and
how
to
be
work
out
in
her
daily
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
one
she
dare
confess
her
ignorance
to
and
ask
information
from
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
have
speak
as
if
her
child
,
sweet
little
merry
Bella
,
with
a
love
word
and
a
kiss
for
every
one
,
be
to
suffer
heavily
for
the
just
and
true
word
her
wronged
and
indignant
mother
have
speak
.
<EOS>
Alice
always
speak
as
if
there
be
no
hope
for
her
;
and
blame
her
,
nevertheless
,
for
not
use
the
mean
of
grace
that
it
be
not
in
her
power
to
avail
herself
of
.
  
<EOS>
and
Hester
,
that
Sylvia
would
fain
have
love
for
her
uniform
gentleness
and
patience
with
all
around
her
,
seem
so
cold
in
her
unruffled
and
undemonstrative
behaviour
;
and
moreover
,
Sylvia
feel
that
Hester
blame
her
perpetual
silence
regard
Philip
's
absence
without
know
how
bitter
a
cause
Sylvia
have
for
cast
him
off
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
person
who
seem
to
have
pity
upon
her
be
Kester
;
and
his
pity
be
show
in
look
rather
than
word
;
for
when
he
come
to
see
her
,
which
he
do
from
time
to
time
,
by
a
kind
of
mutual
tacit
consent
,
they
speak
but
little
of
former
day
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
lodge
with
his
sister
,
widow
Dobson
,
work
at
odd
job
,
some
of
which
take
him
into
the
country
for
week
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
but
on
his
return
to
Monkshaven
he
be
sure
to
come
and
see
her
and
the
little
Bella
;
indeed
,
when
his
employment
be
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
town
,
he
never
allow
a
week
to
pass
away
without
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
conversation
between
him
and
Sylvia
at
such
time
.
<EOS>
They
skim
over
the
surface
of
the
small
event
in
which
both
take
an
interest
;
only
now
and
then
a
sudden
glance
,
a
check
speech
,
tell
each
that
there
be
deep
not
forget
,
although
they
be
never
mention
.
  
<EOS>
twice
Sylvia
 
below
her
breath
 
have
ask
Kester
,
just
as
she
be
hold
the
door
open
for
his
departure
,
if
anything
have
ever
be
hear
of
Kinraid
since
his
one
night
's
visit
to
Monkshaven
:
each
time
(
and
there
be
an
interval
of
some
month
between
the
inquiry
)
<EOS>
the
answer
have
be
simply
,
no
.
  
<EOS>
to
no
one
else
would
Sylvia
ever
have
name
his
name
.
<EOS>
but
indeed
she
have
not
the
chance
,
have
she
wish
it
ever
so
much
,
of
ask
any
question
about
him
from
any
one
likely
to
know
.
<EOS>
the
Corneys
have
leave
Moss
Brow
at
Martinmas
,
and
go
many
mile
away
towards
Horncastle
.
<EOS>
Bessy
Corney

it
be
true
be
marry
and
leave
behind
in
the
neighbourhood
;
but
with
her
Sylvia
have
never
be
intimate
;
and
what
girlish
friendship
there
may
have
be
between
them
have
cool
very
much
at
the
time
of
Kinraid
's
suppose
death
three
year
before

<EOS>
one
day
before
Christmas
in
this
year
,
1798

Sylvia

into
the
shop
by

who

in

cheerful

<EOS>
"

I
would
fain
read

Sylvia

humbly
,

if

would
learn
me
;
for
perhaps
it
may
do
me
good

I
be

"
  
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
as
she
look
up
at
Alice
's
stern
countenance
,
be
full
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
woman
see
it
,
and
be
touch
,
although
she
do
not
immediately
show
her
sympathy
.
<EOS>
but
she
take
her
own
time
,
and
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
however
,
she
bid
Sylvia
come
to
her
,
and
then
and
there
,
as
if
her
pupil
have
be
a
little
child
,
she
begin
to
teach
Sylvia
to
read
the
first
chapter
of
Genesis
;
for
all
other
reading
but
the
scripture
be
as
vanity
to
her
,
and
she
would
not
condescend
to
the
weakness
of
other
book
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
be
now
,
as
ever
,
slow
at
book
-
learning
;
but
she
be
meek
and
desirous
to
be
teach
,
and
her
willingness
in
this
respect
please
Alice
,
and
draw
her
singularly
towards
one
who
,
from
be
a
pupil
,
may
become
a
convert
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
Sylvia
never
lose
the
curiosity
that
have
be
excite
by
the
few
word
Alice
have
let
drop
about
Hester
and
Philip
,
and
by
degree
she
approach
the
subject
again
,
and
have
the
idea
then
start
confirm
by
Alice
,
who
have
no
scruple
in
use
the
past
experience
of
her
own
,
of
her
daughter
's
,
or
of
any
one
's
life
,
as
an
instrument
to
prove
the
vanity
of
set
the
heart
on
anything
earthly
.
  
<EOS>
this
knowledge
,
unsuspected
before
,
sink
deep
into
Sylvia
's
thought
,
and
give
her
a
strange
interest
in
Hester
 
poor
Hester
,
whose
life
she
have
so
cross
and
blight
,
even
by
the
very
blighting
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
give
Hester
her
own
former
passionate
feeling
for
Kinraid
,
and
wonder
how
she
herself
should
have
feel
towards
any
one
who
have
come
between
her
and
him
,
and
wile
his
love
away
.
<EOS>
when
she
remember
Hester
's
unfailing
sweetness
and
kindness
towards
herself
from
the
very
first
,
she
could
better
bear
the
comparative
coldness
of
her
present
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
,
indeed
,
hard
to
win
back
the
favour
she
have
lose
;
but
the
very
mean
she
take
be
blunder
,
and
only
make
it
seem
to
her
as
if
she
could
never
again
do
right
in
Hester
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
for
instance
,
she
beg
her
to
accept
and
wear
the
pretty
poplin
gown
which
have
be
Philip
's
especial
choice
;
feel
within
herself
as
if
she
should
never
wish
to
put
it
on
,
and
as
if
the
good
thing
she
could
do
with
it
be
to
offer
it
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
but
Hester
reject
the
proffer
gift
with
as
much
hardness
of
manner
as
she
be
capable
of
assume
;
and
Sylvia
have
to
carry
it
upstairs
and
lie
it
by
for
the
little
daughter
,
who
,
Hester
say
,
may
perhaps
learn
to
value
thing
that
her
father
have
give
especial
thought
to
.
  
<EOS>
yet
Sylvia
go
on
try
to
win
Hester
to
like
her
once
more
;
it
be
one
of
her
great
labour
,
and
learn
to
read
from
Hester
's
mother
be
another
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
indeed
,
in
her
solemn
way
,
be
become
quite
fond
of
Sylvia
;
if
she
could
not
read
or
write
,
she
have
a
deftness
and
gentleness
of
motion
,
a
capacity
for
the
household
matter
which
fall
into
her
department
,
that
have
a
great
effect
on
the
old
woman
,
and
for
her
dear
mother
's
sake
Sylvia
have
a
stock
of
patient
love
ready
in
her
heart
for
all
the
aged
and
infirm
that
fall
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
never
think
of
seek
them
out
,
as
she
know
that
Hester
do
;
but
then
she
look
up
to
Hester
as
some
one
very
remarkable
for
her
goodness
.
<EOS>
if
only
she
could
have
like
her
!
  
<EOS>
Hester
try
to
do
all
she
could
for
Sylvia
;
Philip
have
tell
her
to
take
care
of
his
wife
and
child
;
but
she
have
the
conviction
that
Sylvia
have
so
materially
fail
in
her
duty
as
to
have
make
her
husband
an
exile
from
his
home
 
a
penniless
wanderer
,
wifeless
and
childless
,
in
some
strange
country
,
whose
very
aspect
be
friendless
,
while
the
cause
of
all
live
on
in
the
comfortable
home
where
he
have
place
her
,
want
for
nothing
 
an
object
of
interest
and
regard
to
many
friend
 
with
a
lovely
little
child
to
give
her
joy
for
the
present
,
and
hope
for
the
future
;
while
he
,
the
poor
outcast
,
may
even
lie
dead
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
how
could
Hester
love
Sylvia
?
  
<EOS>
yet
they
be
frequent
companion
that
ensue
spring
.
<EOS>
Hester
be
not
well
;
and
the
doctor
say
that
the
constant
occupation
in
the
shop
be
too
much
for
her
,
and
that
she
must
,
for
a
time
at
least
,
take
daily
walk
into
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
use
to
beg
to
accompany
her
;
she
and
the
little
girl
often
go
with
Hester
up
the
valley
of
the
river
to
some
of
the
nestling
farm
that
be
hide
in
the
more
sheltered
nook
 
for
Hester
be
bidden
to
drink
milk
warm
from
the
cow
;
and
to
go
into
the
familiar
haunt
about
a
farm
be
one
of
the
few
thing
in
which
Sylvia
seem
to
take
much
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
would
let
little
Bella
toddle
about
while
Hester
sate
and
rest
:
and
she
herself
would
beg
to
milk
the
cow
destine
to
give
the
invalid
her
draught
.
  
<EOS>
one
May
evening
the
three
have
be
out
on
some
such
expedition
;
the
country
side
still
look
gray
and
bare
,
though
the
leave
be
show
on
the
willow
and
blackthorn
and
sloe
,
and
by
the
tinkling
runnel
,
make
hide
music
along
the
copse
side
,
the
pale
delicate
primrose
bud
be
show
amid
their
fresh
,
green
,
crinkled
leave
.
<EOS>
the
lark
have
be
singe
all
the
afternoon
,
but
be
now
drop
down
into
their
nest
in
the
pasture
field
;
the
air
have
just
the
sharpness
in
it
which
go
along
with
a
cloudless
evening
sky
at
that
time
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hester
walk
homeward
slowly
and
languidly
,
speak
no
word
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
notice
this
at
first
without
venture
to
speak
,
for
Hester
be
one
who
dislike
have
her
ailment
notice
.
<EOS>
but
after
a
while
Hester
stand
still
in
a
sort
of
weary
dreamy
abstraction
;
and
Sylvia
say
to
her
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afeare
yo're
sadly
tired
.
<EOS>
maybe
we
have
be
too
far

"
  
<EOS>
Hester
almost
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
she
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
only
my
headache
which
be
bad
to

night

<EOS>
It
have
be
bad
all
day
;
but
since
I
come
out
it
have
feel
just
as
if
there
be
great
gun
boom

till
I
could
almost
pray
'em
to

<EOS>
I

"
  
<EOS>
She
step
out
quickly
towards
home
after
she
have
say
this
,
as

she
wish
for
neither
pity
nor
comment
on

near
its

the

of
the
sycamore
low

there
by
a
solitary
terebinth

ilex

,
of

a

shore
there
be
the
white

of
a
fortified

glitter

<EOS>
the
fortification
themselves
run
out
into

form
a
port

against

out

beyond

majority
of

gather
together
to
defend
the
breach
,
where
the
french
gun
thunder
out
far
above
the
head
of
the
sailor
.
  
<EOS>
They
go
along
none
the
less
merrily
for
the
sound
to
Djezzar
Pacha
's
garden
,
where
the
old
Turk
sate
on
his
carpet
,
beneath
the
shade
of
a
great
terebinth
tree
,
listen
to
the
interpreter
,
who
make
known
to
him
the
meaning
of
the
eager
speech
of
Sir
Sidney
Smith
and
the
colonel
of
the
marines
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
admiral
see
the
gallant
sailor
of
H.M.S.
_
Tigre
_
,
he
interrupt
the
council
of
war
without
much
ceremony
,
and
go
to
Kinraid
,
he
despatch
them
,
as
before
arrange
,
to
the
North
Ravelin
,
show
them
the
way
with
rapid
,
clear
direction
.
  
<EOS>
out
of
respect
to
him
,
they
have
keep
silent
while
in
the
strange
,
desolate
garden
;
but
once
more
in
the
street
,
the
old
Newcastle
song
rise
up
again
till
the
man
be
,
perforce
,
silence
by
the
haste
with
which
they
go
to
the
post
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
for
many
a
day
these
very
man
have
be
swear
at
the
terrific
heat
at
this
hour
 
even
when
at
sea
,
fan
by
the
soft
breeze
;
but
now
,
in
the
midst
of
hot
smoke
,
with
former
carnage
taint
the
air
,
and
with
the
rush
and
whizz
of
death
perpetually
whistle
in
their
ear
,
they
be
uncomplaining
and
light
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
many
an
old
joke
,
and
some
new
one
,
come
brave
and
hearty
,
on
their
cheerful
voice
,
even
though
the
speaker
be
veil
from
sight
in
great
cloud
of
smoke
,
cloven
only
by
the
bright
flame
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
a
sudden
message
come
;
as
many
of
the
crew
of
the
_
Tigre
_
as
be
under
Lieutenant
Kinraid
's
command
be
to
go
down
to
the
Mole
,
to
assist
the
new
reinforcement
(
see
by
the
sailor
from
the
masthead
at
day
-
dawn
)
,
under
command
of
Hassan
Bey
,
to
land
at
the
Mole
,
where
Sir
Sidney
then
be
.
  
<EOS>
off
they
go
,
almost
as
bright
and
thoughtless
as
before
,
though
two
of
their
number
lie
silent
for
ever
at
the
North
Ravelin
 
silence
in
that
one
little
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
and
one
go
along
with
the
rest
,
swear
lustily
at
his
ill
-
luck
in
have
his
right
arm
break
,
but
ready
to
do
good
business
with
his
left
.
  
<EOS>
They
help
the
turkish
troop
to
land
more
with
good
-
will
than
tenderness
;
and
then
,
lead
by
Sir
Sidney
,
they
go
under
the
shelter
of
english
gun
to
the
fatal
breach
,
so
often
assailed
,
so
gallantly
defended
,
but
never
so
fiercely
contest
as
on
this
burn
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
ruin
of
the
massive
wall
that
here
have
be
break
down
by
the
French
,
be
use
by
them
as
step
stone
to
get
on
a
level
with
the
besiege
,
and
so
to
escape
the
heavy
stone
which
the
latter
hurl
down
;
nay
,
even
the
dead
body
of
the
morning
's
comrade
be
make
into
ghastly
stair
.
  
<EOS>
when
Djezzar
Pacha
hear
that
the
british
sailor
be
defend
the
breach
,
head
by
Sir
Sidney
Smith
,
he
leave
his
station
in
the
palace
garden
,
gather
up
his
robe
in
haste
,
and
hurry
to
the
breach
;
where
,
with
his
own
hand
,
and
with
right
hearty
good
-
will
,
he
pull
the
sailor
down
from
the
post
of
danger
,
say
that
if
he
lose
his
english
friend
he
lose
all
!
  
<EOS>
but
little
recke
the
crew
of
the
_
Tigre
_
of
the
one
old
man
 
Pacha
or
otherwise
 
who
try
to
hold
them
back
from
the
fight
;
they
be
up
and
at
the
french
assailant
clamber
over
the
breach
in
an
instant
;
and
so
they
go
on
,
as
if
it
be
some
game
at
play
instead
of
a
deadly
combat
,
until
Kinraid
and
his
man
be
call
off
by
Sir
Sidney
,
as
the
reinforcement
of
turkish
troop
under
Hassan
Bey
be
now
sufficient
for
the
defence
of
that
old
breach
in
the
wall
,
which
be
no
longer
the
principal
object
of
the
french
attack
;
for
the
besieger
have
make
a
new
and
more
formidable
breach
by
their
incessant
fire
,
knock
down
whole
street
of
the
city
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
fight
your
good
Kinraid

"
say
Sir
Sidney
;
"
for
there
be
Boney
on
yonder
hill

at
you

"
  
<EOS>
and
sure
enough
,
on
a
rise
ground
,
call
Richard
Coeur
de
Lion
's
Mount
,
there
be
a
half
-
circle
of
french
general
,
on
horseback
,
all
deferentially
attend
to
the
motion
,
and
apparently
to
the
word
,
of
a
little
man
in
their
centre
;
at
whose
bidding
the
aide

de

camp
gallop
swift
with
message
to
the
more
distant
french
camp
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
ravelin
which
Kinraid
and
his
man
have
to
occupy
,
for
the
purpose
of
send
a
flank
fire
upon
the
enemy
,
be
not
ten
yard
from
that
enemy
's
van
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
length
there
be
a
sudden
rush
of
the
French
to
that
part
of
the
wall
where
they
imagine
they
could
enter
unopposed
.
  
<EOS>
surprise
at
this
movement
,
Kinraid
venture
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
ravelin
to
ascertain
the
cause
;
he
,
safe
and
untouched
during
that
long
afternoon
of
carnage
,
fall
now
,
under
a
stray
musket
-
shoot
,
and
lie
helpless
and
expose
upon
the
ground
undiscerne
by
his
man
,
who
be
recall
to
help
in
the
hot
reception
which
have
be
plan
for
the
French
;
who
,
descend
the
city

into
the
Pacha

garden
,
be
attack
with
sabre
and
dagger
,
and
lie
headless
corpse
under
the
flower

bush
,
and
by
the
fountain
side
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
lie
beyond
the
ravelin
,
many
yard
outside
the
city
wall
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
utterly
helpless
,
for
the
shot
have
break
his
leg
.
<EOS>
dead
body
of
frenchman
lie
strew
around
him
;
no
Englishman
have
venture
out
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
wound
man
that
he
could
see
be
French
;
and
many
of
these
,
furious
with
pain
,
gnash
their
tooth
at
him
,
and
curse
him
aloud
,
till
he
think
that
his
good
course
be
to
assume
the
semblance
of
death
;
for
some
among
these
man
be
still
capable
of
drag
themselves
up
to
him
,
and
by
concentrate
all
their
fail
energy
into
one
blow
,
put
him
to
a
speedy
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
outlying
picket
of
the
french
army
be
within
easy
rifle
shot
;
and
his
uniform
,
although
less
conspicuous
in
colour
than
that
of
the
marines
,
by
whose
side
he
have
be
fight
,
would
make
him
a
sure
mark
if
he
so
much
as
move
his
arm
.
<EOS>
yet
how
he
long
to
turn
,
if
ever
so
slightly
,
so
that
the
cruel
slanting
sun
may
not
beat
full
into
his
ache
eye
.
<EOS>
Fever
,
too
,
be
come
upon
him
;
the
pain
in
his
leg
be
every
moment
grow
more
severe
;
the
terrible
thirst
of
the
wound
,
add
to
the
heat
and
fatigue
of
the
day
,
make
his
lip
and
tongue
feel
baked
and
dry
,
and
his
whole
throat
seem
parched
and
wooden
.
<EOS>
thought
of
other
day
,
of
cool
Greenland
seas
,
where
ice
abound
,
of
grassy
english
home
,
begin
to
make
the
past
more
real
than
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
great
effort
he
bring
his
wander
sense
back
;
he
know
where
he
be
now
,
and
could
weigh
the
chance
of
his
life
,
which
be
but
small
;
the
unwonted
tear
come
to
his
eye
as
he
think
of
the
newly
-
make
wife
in
her
english
home
,
who
may
never
know
how
he
die
thinking
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
he
see
a
party
of
English
marines
advance
,
under
shelter
of
the
ravelin
,
to
pick
up
the
wounded
,
and
bear
them
within
the
wall
for
surgical
help
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
near
he
could
see
their
face
,
could
hear
them
speak
;
yet
he
durst
not
make
any
sign
to
them
when
he
lie
within
range
of
the
french
picket
's
fire
.
  
<EOS>
for
one
moment
he
could
not
resist
raise
his
head
,
to
give
himself
a
chance
for
life
;
before
the
unclean
creature
that
infest
a
camp
come
round
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
strip
and
insult
the
dead
body
,
and
to
put
to
death
such
as
have
yet
the
breath
of
life
within
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
set
sun
come
full
into
his
face
,
and
he
see
nothing
of
what
he
long
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
He
fall
back
in
despair
;
he
lie
there
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
that
strong
clear
sunbeam
have
work
his
salvation
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
recognize
as
man
be
recognize
when
they
stand
in
the
red
glare
of
a
house
on
fire
;
the
same
despair
of
help
,
of
hopeless
farewell
to
life
,
stamp
on
their
face
in
blood
-
red
light
.
  
<EOS>
one
man
leave
his
fellow
,
and
come
run
forwards
,
forwards
in
among
the
enemy
's
wound
,
within
range
of
their
gun
;
he
bend
down
over
Kinraid
;
he
seem
to
understand
without
a
word
;
he
lift
him
up
,
carry
him
like
a
child
;
and
with
the
vehement
energy
that
be
more
from
the
force
of
will
than
the
strength
of
body
,
he
bear
him
back
to
within
the
shelter
of
the
ravelin
 
not
without
many
shot
be
aim
at
them
,
one
of
which
hit
Kinraid
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
be
rack
with
agony
from
his
dangling
break
leg
,
and
his
very
life
seem
leave
him
;
yet
he
remember
afterwards
how
the
marine
recall
his
fellow
,
and
how
,
in
the
pause
before
they
return
,
his
face
become
like
one
formerly
know
to
the
sick
sense
of
Kinraid
;
yet
it
be
too
like
a
dream
,
too
utterly
improbable
to
be
real
.
  
<EOS>
yet
the
few
word
this
man
say
,
as
he
stand
breathless
and
alone
by
the
faint
Kinraid
,
fit
in
well
with
the
belief
<EOS>
conjure
up
by
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
pant
out
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
niver
think
you
would
ha
'
keep
true
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
other
come
up
;
and
while
they
be
make
a
sling
of
their
belt
,
Kinraid
faint
utterly
away
,
and
the
next
time
that
he
be
fully
conscious
,
he
be
lie
in
his
berth
in
the
_
Tigre
_
,
with
the
ship
surgeon
set
his
leg
.
<EOS>
after
that
he
be
too
feverish
for
several
day
to
collect
his
sense
.
<EOS>
when
he
could
first
remember
,
and
form
a
judgment
upon
his
recollection
,
he
call
the
man
especially
charge
to
attend
upon
him
,
and
bade
him
go
and
make
inquiry
in
every
possible
manner
for
a
marine
name
Philip
Hepburn
,
and
,
when
he
be
find
,
to
entreat
him
to
come
and
see
Kinraid
.
  
<EOS>
the
sailor
be
away
the
great
part
of
the
day
,
and
return
unsuccessful
in
his
search
;
he
have
be
from
ship
to
ship
,
hither
and
thither
;
he
have
question
all
the
marines
he
have
meet
with
,
no
one
know
anything
of
any
Philip
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
pass
a
miserably
feverish
night
,
and
when
the
doctor
exclaim
the
next
morning
at
his
retrogression
,
he
tell
him
,
with
some
irritation
,
of
the
ill
-
success
of
his
servant
;
he
accuse
the
man
of
stupidity
,
and
wish
fervently
that
he
be
able
to
go
himself
.
  
<EOS>
partly
to
soothe
him
,
the
doctor
promise
that
he
would
undertake
the
search
for
Hepburn
,
and
he
engage
faithfully
to
follow
all
Kinraid
's
eager
direction
;
not
to
be
satisfied
with
man
's
careless
word
,
but
to
look
over
muster
-
roll
and
ship
'
book
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
bring
the
same
answer
,
however
unwillingly
give
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
set
out
upon
the
search
so
confident
of
success
,
that
he
feel
doubly
discomfit
by
failure
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
persuade
himself
that
the
lieutenant
have
be
partially
delirious
from
the
effect
of
his
wound
,
and
the
power
of
the
sun
shine
down
just
where
he
lie
.
<EOS>
there
have
,
indeed
,
be
slight
symptom
of
Kinraid
's
have
receive
a
sun
-
stroke
;
and
the
doctor
dwell
largely
on
these
in
his
endeavour
to
persuade
his
patient
that
it
be
his
imagination
which
have
endue
a
stranger
with
the
lineament
of
some
former
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
throw
his
arm
out
of
bed
with
impatience
at
all
this
plausible
talk
,
which
be
even
more
irritating
than
the
fact
that
Hepburn
be
still
undiscovered
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
no
friend
of
mine
;
I
be
like
to

kill
him
when

I

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I
have
see
little
enough
of

but
enough
to
make
me
able
to
swear
to

even
in

and
in
this

quoth
the
doctor

sententiously
.
  
<EOS>
the
attendant
sailor
,
reinstall
to
some
complacency
by
the
failure
of
another
in
the
search
in
which
he
himself
have
be
unsuccessful
,
now
put
in
his
explanation

<EOS>
"
maybe
it

its

then
he
draw
a

breath

turn
his
head
to
look
at
his

ask
him
how
he
would
manage
to
come
out
of

th

set
out

then
he
know
that
it

a
spirit
come
to
help
him
against
th

think
to
rob
him

would
likely

ha

murder
him

<EOS>
Kinraid
have
keep
quiet
through
this
story

when
the
sailor
begin
to
draw
the
moral
,

to
say
,

I
think
I
may
make
bold

as

He

over

yet
we
hate
each
other
like
poison

I
can
not
make
out
why
he
should
be
there

put
himself
in

save
me

so
it

CONFIDENCES
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
later
on
in

summer
that
Mrs.

come
to

her
sister
Bessy

<EOS>
bessy

to
a
tolerably
well
-
to

do
farmer
who
live
at
an
almost
equal
distance
between
Monkshaven
and
Hartswell
;
but
from
old
habit
and
convenience
the
latter
be
regard
as
the
dawson
'
market
-
town
;
so
Bessy
seldom
or
never
see
her
old
friend
in
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Brunton
be
far
too
flourish
a
person
not
to
speak
out
her
wish
,
and
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
notion
,
she
say
,
of
come
such
a
long
journey
only
to
see
Bessy
and
her
husband
,
and
not
to
have
a
sight
of
her
former
acquaintance
at
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
add
,
that
her
new
bonnet
and
cloak
would
be
as
good
as
lose
if
it
be
not
display
among
those
who
,
know
her
as
Molly
Corney
,
and
be
less
fortunate
in
matrimony
than
she
be

would
look
upon
it
with
wonder
admiration
,
if
not
with
envy

Mrs.

<EOS>
Sylvia

raw

Molly

altogether
distasteful
to

train
in

with
Hester
to
appreciate

however

they
keep
up
the
form
of
their

They

perhaps
more

the

<EOS>
at
this
moment
Hester
come
into
the
room
;
and
Sylvia
joyfully
avail
herself
of
the
pretext
for
break
off
the
conversation
that
have
reach
this
painful
and
awkward
point
.
<EOS>
She
detain
Hester
in
the
room
for
fear
lest
Mrs.
Brunton
should
repeat
her
inquiry
as
to
how
it
all
happen
that
Philip
have
go
away
;
but
the
presence
of
a
third
person
seem
as
though
it
would
be
but
little
restraint
upon
the
inquisitive
Molly
,
who
repeatedly
bear
down
upon
the
same
question
till
she
nearly
drive
Sylvia
distract
,
between
her
astonishment
at
the
news
of
Kinraid
's
marriage
;
her
wish
to
be
alone
and
quiet
,
so
as
to
realize
the
full
meaning
of
that
piece
of
intelligence
;
her
desire
to
retain
Hester
in
the
conversation
;
her
effort
to
prevent
Molly
's
recurrence
to
the
circumstance
of
Philip
's
disappearance
,
and
the
longing
 
more
vehement
every
minute
 
for
her
visitor
to
go
away
and
leave
her
in
peace
.
<EOS>
She
become
so
disturbed
with
all
these
thought
and
feeling
that
she
hardly
know
what
she
be
say
,
and
assent
or
dissent
to
speech
without
there
be
either
any
reason
or
truth
in
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Brunton
have
arrange
to
remain
with
Sylvia
while
the
horse
rest
,
and
have
no
compunction
about
the
length
of
her
visit
.
<EOS>
She
expect
to
be
ask
to
tea
,
as
Sylvia
find
out
at
last
,
and
this
she
feel
would
be
the
bad
of
all
,
as
Alice
Rose
be
not
one
to
tolerate
the
coarse
,
careless
talk
of
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Brunton
without
uplift
her
voice
in
many
a
testimony
against
it
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sate
hold
Hester
's
gown
tight
in
order
to
prevent
her
leave
the
room
,
and
try
to
arrange
her
little
plan
so
that
too
much
discordance
should
not
arise
to
the
surface
.
<EOS>
just
then
the
door
open
,
and
little
Bella
come
in
from
the
kitchen
in
all
the
pretty
,
sturdy
dignity
of
two
year
old
,
Alice
follow
her
with
careful
step
,
and
protect
,
outstretche
arm
,
a
slow
smile
soften
the
sternness
of
her
grave
face
;
for
the
child
be
the
unconscious
darling
of
the
household
,
and
all
eye
soften
into
love
as
they
look
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
make
straight
for
her
mother
with
something
grasp
in
her
little
dimpled
fist
;
but
half
-
way
across
the
room
she
seem
to
have
become
suddenly
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
,
and
she
stop
short
,
fix
her
serious
eye
full
on
Mrs.
Brunton
,
as
if
to
take
in
her
appearance
,
nay
,
as
if
to
penetrate
down
into
her
very
real
self
,
and
then
,
stretch
out
her
disengaged
hand
,
the
baby
speak
out
the
word
that
have
be
hover
about
her
mother
's
lip
for
an
hour
past

"

Bella
,
decisively

<EOS>
"
what
a
perfect

Mrs.
Brunton
,
half
in
real
admiration
,
half
in
patronage

<EOS>
as
she
speak
,
she
get
up
and
go
towards
the
child

as
if

her
up

"

affright
at

<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Brunton
have
grasp
the
struggling
,
kick
child
by
this
time
,
and
her
reward
for
this
be
a
vehement
little
slap
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo

"
  
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
have
put
as
much
venom
as
she
know
how
into
this
speech
,
mean
it
as
a
vengeful
payment
for
the
supposition
of
her
be
thirty
,
even
more
than
for
the
reproof
for
her
angry
word
about
the
child
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
Alice
Rose
must
be
either
mother
or
aunt
to
Philip
,
from
the
serious
cast
of
countenance
that
be
remarkable
in
both
;
and
she
rather
exult
in
the
allusion
to
a
happy
second
marriage
for
Sylvia
,
with
which
she
have
conclude
her
speech
.
<EOS>
It
rouse
Alice
,
however
,
as
effectually
as
if
she
have
be
really
a
blood
relation
to
Philip
;
but
for
a
different
reason
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
slow
to
detect
the
intentional
offensiveness
to
herself
in
what
have
be
say
;
she
be
indignant
at
Sylvia
for
suffer
the
word
speak
to
pass
unanswere
;
but
in
truth
they
be
too
much
in
keep
with
Molly
Brunton
's
character
to
make
as
much
impression
on
Sylvia
as
they
do
on
a
stranger
;
and
besides
,
she
feel
as
if
the
less
reply
Molly
receive
,
the
less
likely
would
it
be
that
she
would
go
on
in
the
same
strain
.
<EOS>
so
she
coax
and
chatter
to
her
child
and
behave
like
a
little
coward
in
try
to
draw
out
of
the
conversation
,
while
at
the
same
time
listen
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
for
Sylvia
Hepburn
as
be
Sylvia
Robson
<EOS>
,
she
know
my
mind
,
"
say
Alice
,
in
grim
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
humble
herself
now
,
I
trust
and
pray
,
but
she
be
light
-
minded
and
full
of
vanity
when
Philip
marry
her
,
and
it
may
ha
'
be
a
lift
towards
her
salvation
in
one
way
;
but
it
please
the
Lord
to
work
in
a
different
way
,
and
she
mun
wear
her
sackcloth
and
ashe
in
patience
.
<EOS>
so
I
will
say
naught
more
about
her
.
<EOS>
but
for
him
as
be
absent
,
as
thee
hast
speak
on
so
lightly
and
reproachfully
,
I
would
have
thee
to
know
he
be
one
of
a
different
kind
to
any
thee
<EOS>
ever
know
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
lead
away
by
a
pretty
face
to
slight
one
as
be
fitter
for
him
,
and
who
have
love
him
as
the
apple
of
her
eye
,
it
be
him
as
be
suffer
for
it
,
inasmuch
as
he
be
a
wanderer
from
his
home
,
and
an
outcast
from
wife
and
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
the
surprise
of
all
,
Molly
's
word
of
reply
be
cut
short
even
when
they
be
on
her
lip
,
by
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Pale
,
fire
-
eyed
,
and
excited
,
with
Philip
's
child
on
one
arm
,
and
the
other
stretch
out
,
she
say
,
    
"
Noane

<EOS>
no

cruel

I
have
say
my
word
to
him
hissel

I
be
noane
go
to
make
any
plaint
to

;
only
them
as
know
should
judge
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
fitting
,
it
be
not
'
(
almost
sob
)
,
"
to
go
on
wi
'
talk
like
this
afore
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
 
for
Hester
,
who
be
aware
that
her
presence
have
only
be
desire
by
Sylvia
as
a
check
to
an
unpleasant
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
conversation
,
have
slip
back
to
her
business
as
soon
as
her
mother
come
in
 
the
two
look
with
surprise
at
Sylvia
;
her
word
,
her
whole
manner
,
belong
to
a
phase
of
her
character
which
seldom
come
uppermost
,
and
which
have
not
be
perceive
by
either
of
them
before
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
,
though
astonished
,
rather
approve
of
Sylvia
's
speech
;
it
show
that
she
have
more
serious
thought
and
feeling
on
the
subject
than
the
old
woman
have
give
her
credit
for
;
her
general
silence
respect
her
husband
's
disappearance
have
lead
Alice
to
think
that
she
be
too
childish
to
have
receive
any
deep
impression
from
the
event
.
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
give
vent
to
her
opinion
on
Sylvia
's
speech
in
the
follow
word
:
    
"
Hoighty
-
toighty
!
<EOS>
that
tell
tale
,
lass
.
<EOS>
if
yo
'
treat
steady
Philip
to
many
such
look
an
'
speech
as
yo'n
give
us
now
,
it
be
<EOS>
easy
t
'
see
why
he
take
hisself
off
.
<EOS>
why
,
Sylvia
,
I
niver
see
it
in
yo
'
when
yo
'
be
a
girl
;
yo're
grow
into
a
regular
little
vixen
,
theere
wheere
yo
'
stand
!
"
  
<EOS>
indeed
she
do
look
defiant
,
with
the
swift
colour
flush
her
cheek
to
crimson
on
its
return
,
and
the
fire
in
her
eye
not
yet
die
away
.
<EOS>
but
at
Molly
's
jesting
word
she
sink
back
into
her
usual
look
and
manner
,
only
say
quietly
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
noane
to
say
whether
I
be
vixen
or
not
,
as
do
not
know
th
'
past
thing
as
be
bury
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
hold
them
as
my
friend
as
go
on
talk
on
either
my
husband
or
me
before
my
very
face
.
<EOS>
what
he
be
,
I
know
;
and
what
I
be
,
I
reckon
he
know
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
will
go
hurry
tea
,
for
yo'll
be
need
it
,
Molly
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
last
clause
of
this
speech
be
mean
to
make
peace
;
but
Molly
be
in
twenty
mind
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
the
olive
-
branch
or
not
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
,
however
,
be
of
that
obtuse
kind
which
be
not
easily
ruffle
;
her
mind
,
stagnant
in
itself
,
enjoy
excitement
from
without
;
and
her
appetite
be
invariably
good
,
so
she
stay
,
in
spite
of
the
inevitable
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
however
,
refuse
to
be
draw
into
conversation
again
;
reply
to
Mrs.
Brunton
's
speech
with
a
curt
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
or
no
,
when
,
indeed
,
she
reply
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
when
all
be
gather
at
tea
,
Sylvia
be
quite
calm
again
;
rather
paler
than
usual
,
and
very
attentive
and
subduce
in
her
behaviour
to
Alice
;
she
would
evidently
fain
have
be
silent
,
but
as
Molly
be
her
own
especial
guest
,
that
could
not
be
,
so
all
her
endeavour
go
towards
steer
the
conversation
away
from
any
awkward
point
.
<EOS>
but
each
of
the
four
,
let
alone
little
Bella
,
be
thankful
when
the
market
-
cart
draw
up
at
the
shop
door
,
<EOS>
that
be
to
take
Mrs.
Brunton
back
to
her
sister
's
house

<EOS>
when
she
be
fairly
off
,
Alice
Rose
open
her
mouth
in
strong
condemnation
;
wind
up
with
    
"
<EOS>
and
if
aught
in
my
word
give
thee
cause
for
offence
,
Sylvia
,
it
be
because
my
heart
rise
within
me
at
the
kind
of
talk
thee
and
she
have
be
have
about
Philip
;
and
her
evil
and
light
-
minded
counsel
to
thee
about
wait
seven
year
,
and
then
wed
another

"
  
<EOS>
hard
as
these
word
may
seem
<EOS>
when
repeat
,
there
be
something
of
a
near
approach
to
an
apology
in
Mrs.
Rose
's
manner
than
Sylvia
have
ever
see
in
it
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
silent
for
a
few
moment
<EOS>
,
then
she
say
,
    
"

kind

home
this
very
night

She
would
have
go
on

Hester
interrupt

what

what

<EOS>
all
she
could
say
in

to
Mrs.

eager

still
more
eager
look

be
,
that
her

long
from

she

she

<EOS>
Mrs.

face
fall
a
little
,
partly
from
her
own
real
disappointment
,
partly
out
of
sympathy
with
the
hopeless

indifferent
tone
of
Sylvia

reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.

faintly

I

<EOS>
so
could

it

the

so
;

he
be
not

I
think
I
would
get
his
letter
with
me
;

I
would
have
read
you
a
part

I
leave
it
at

the

write
very
much

else
I

you

sure
it
be
your

venture
into
all

danger

the

not

say
so

they

they
be

not

I
wish
I
would
get
the
letter
here

I
can
not
think
how
I
could
be
so
stupid
;
I
think
I
can
almost
remember
the
very
word
,
though
 
I
have
read
them
over
so
often

He
say
,
"
just
as
I
give
up
all
hope

I
see
one
Philip
Hepburn

a
man

I
have
know
at
Monkshaven

whom
I
have
some
reason
to
remember
well

<EOS>
(
I
be
sure
he
say
<EOS>
so
 
"
remember
well

)
,
"
he
see
me
too
,
and
come
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
where
I
lie

<EOS>
I
fully
expect
he
would
be
shoot
down

I
shut
my
eye
not
to
see
the
end
of
my
last
chance

<EOS>
the
shot
rain
about
him
,

I
think
he
be
hit
;

he
take
me
up
and
carry
me
under
cover
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
say
that
,
I
have
read
it
over
so
often
;
and
he
go
on
and
say
how
he
hunt
for
Mr.
Hepburn
all
through
the
ship
,
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
;
but
he
could
hear
nothing

him

either
alive

dead

do
not
go
so
white

for
pity
's
sake

she

suddenly
startle

blanch
colour

<EOS>
You
see
,
because
he
could
not
find
him
alive
be
no
reason
for
give
him
up
as
dead
;
because
his
name
be
not
to
be
find
on
any
of
the
ship

book

so
the
captain
think
he
must
have
be
know
by
a
different
name
to
his
real
one

<EOS>
only
he
say
he
should
like

he

he

give
a
deal

have

as
I
be
stay
two
day
at

I
tell
them
I
must
come
over
to
Monkshaven

if
only
for
five
minute

just
to
hear
if
your

ask

of

She
go
away

stun

<EOS>
Philip
a
soldier

<EOS>
Philip
in
a
battle
,
risk
his

<EOS>
most
strange
of
all
,
Charley
and
Philip
once
more
meeting
together
,
not
as
rival
or
as
foe
,
but
as
saviour
and
save
!
<EOS>
add
to
all
this
the
conviction
,
strengthen
by
every
word
that
happy
,
love
wife
have
utter
,
that
Kinraid
's
old
,
passionate
love
for
herself
have
fade
away
and
vanish
utterly
:
its
very
existence
apparently
blot
out
of
his
memory

<EOS>
She
have
tear
up
her
love
for
him
by
the
root
,
but
she
feel
as
if
she
could
never
forget
that
it
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
bring
back
Bella
to
her
mother

<EOS>
She
have
not
like
to
interrupt
the
conversation
with
the
strange
lady
before

and
now
she
find
her
mother
in
an
obvious
state
of
excitement
;
Sylvia
quieter
than
usual

such
a
noise
about

place
at
the
time
of
Darley

death

<EOS>
He
be
now
a
captain
 
a
navy
captain

accord
to
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
fain
have
us
believe
that
Philip
be
abide
in
all
manner
of
scripture
place

place
as
have
be
long
do
away
with

the
similitude
whereof
be
in

where
the

she

there

a
soldier

and
that
he
save
her
husband
's
life
,
and
be
come
home
soon

<EOS>
I
wonder
what
John
and
Jeremiah
will
say
to
his
soldiering
then
?
<EOS>
It
will
noane
be
to
their
taste
,
I
be
think

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
unintelligible
to
Hester
,
and
she
would
dearly
have
like
to
question
Sylvia
;
but
Sylvia
sate
a
little
apart
,
with
Bella
on
her
knee
,
her
cheek
rest
on
her
child
's
golden
curl
,
and
her
eye
fix
and
almost
trance
-
like
,
as
if
she
be
see
thing
not
present
.
  
<EOS>
so
Hester
have
to
be
content
with
ask
her
mother
as
many
elucidatory
question
as
she
could
;
and
after
all
do
not
gain
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
have
really
be
say
by
Mrs.
Kinraid
,
as
her
mother
be
more
full
of
the
apparent
injustice
of
Philip
's
be
allow
the
privilege
of
tread
on
holy
ground
 
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
that
holy
ground
exist
on
this
side
heaven
,
which
she
be
incline
to
dispute
 
than
to
confine
herself
to
the
repetition
of
word
,
or
narration
of
fact
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
Sylvia
rouse
herself
to
a
sense
of
Hester
's
deep
interest
and
balk
inquiry
,
and
she
go
over
the
ground
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'r
mother
say
right
 
<EOS>
she
be
his
wife

<EOS>
and
he
be
away
fight
;
and
get
too
near
t
'
French
as
be
shoot
and
fire
all
round
him
;
and
just
then
,
accord
to
her
story
,
Philip
see
him
,
and
go
straight
into
t
'
midst
o
'
t
'
shot
,
and
fetch
him
out
o

danger
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
she
say
,
and
uphold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
should
it
not
be
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Hester
,
her
cheek
flush
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
only
shake
her
head
,
and
say
,
  
"
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
they
would
little
cause
to
be
friend
,
and
it
seem
all
so
strange
 
<EOS>
Philip
a
soldier
,
and
them
meet
theere
after
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
lay
the
story
of
Philip
's
bravery
to
her
heart
 
<EOS>
she
fully
believe
in
it
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
ponder
it
more
deeply
still
;
the
cause
for
her
disbelief
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
for
her
wonder
,
be
unknown
to
Hester
!
<EOS>
many
a
time
she
sink
to
sleep
with
the
picture
of
the
event
narrate
by
Mrs.
Kinraid
as
present
to
her
mind
as
her
imagination
or
experience
could
make
it
:
first
one
figure
prominent
,
then
another
.
<EOS>
many
a
morning
she
waken
up
,
her
heart
beat
wildly
,
why
,
she
know
not
,
till
she
shudder
at
the
remembrance
of
the
scene
that
have
pass
in
her
dream
:
scene
that
may
be
act
in
reality
that
very
day
;
for
Philip
may
come
back
,
and
then
?
  
<EOS>
and
where
be
Philip
all
this
time
,
these
many
week
,
these
heavily
pass
month
?
    
<EOS>
the
BEDESMAN
of
ST
SEPULCHRE
  
<EOS>
Philip
lie
long
ill
on
board
the
hospital
ship
.
<EOS>
if
his
heart
have
be
light
,
he
may
have
rally
sooner
;
but
he
be
so
depressed
he
do
not
care
to
live
.
<EOS>
His
shattered
jaw
-
bone
,
his
burn
and
blacken
face
,
his
many
injury
of
body
,
be
torture
to
both
his
physical
frame
,
and
his
sick
,
weary
heart
.
<EOS>
no
more
chance
for
him
,
if
indeed
there
ever
have
be
any
,
of
return
gay
and
gallant
,
and
thus
regain
his
wife
's
love
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
his
poor
,
foolish
vision
in
the
first
hour
of
his
enlistment
;
and
the
vain
dream
have
recur
more
than
once
in
the
feverish
stage
of
excitement
which
the
new
scene
into
which
he
have
be
hurry
as
a
recruit
have
call
forth
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
be
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
to
have
come
to
pass
;
and
yet
those
be
happy
day
when
he
could
think
of
it
as
barely
possible
.
<EOS>
now
all
he
could
look
forward
to
be
disfigurement
,
feebleness
,
and
the
bare
pittance
that
keep
pensioner
from
absolute
want
.
  
<EOS>
those
around
him
be
kind
enough
to
him
in
their
fashion
,
and
attend
to
his
bodily
requirement
;
but
they
have
no
notion
of
listen
to
any
revelation
of
unhappiness
,
if
Philip
have
be
the
man
to
make
confidence
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
lie
very
still
in
his
berth
,
seldom
ask
for
anything
,
and
always
say
he
be
well
,
when
the
ship
-
surgeon
come
round
with
his
daily
inquiry
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
care
to
rally
,
and
be
rather
sorry
to
find
that
his
case
be
consider
so
interesting
in
a
surgical
point
of
view
,
that
he
be
likely
to
receive
a
good
deal
more
than
the
average
amount
of
attention
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
owe
to
this
that
he
recover
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
say
it
be
the
heat
that
make
him
languid
,
for
that
his
wound
and
burn
be
all
do
well
at
last
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
they
tell
him
they
have
order
him
"
home
"
.
<EOS>
His
pulse
sink
under
the
surgeon
's
finger
at
the
mention
of
the
word
;
but
he
do
not
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
indifferent
to
life
and
the
world
to
have
a
will
;
otherwise
they
may
have
keep
their
pet
patient
a
little
longer
where
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
pass
from
ship
to
ship
as
occasion
serve
;
rest
here
and
there
in
garrison
hospital
,
Philip
at
length
reach
Portsmouth
on
the
evening
of
a
September
day
in
1799
.
<EOS>
the
transport
-
ship
in
which
he
be
,
be
load
with
wounded
and
invalided
soldier
and
sailor
;
all
who
could
manage
it
in
any
way
struggle
on
deck
to
catch
the
first
view
of
the
white
coast
of
England
.
<EOS>
one
man
lift
his
arm
,
take
off
his
cap
,
and
feebly
wave
it
aloft
,
cry
,
"
Old
England
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
faint
shrill
voice
,
and
then
burst
into
tear
and
sob
aloud
.
<EOS>
other
try

while
more
sate

weak
and
motionless
,
look
towards
the
shore
that
once
,
not
so
long
ago
,
they
never
think
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
one
of
these
;
his
place
a
little
apart
from
the
other
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
muffle
up
in
a
great
military
cloak
that
have
be
give
him
by
one
of
his
officer
;
he
feel
the
September
breeze
chill
after
his
sojourn
in
a
warm
climate
,
and
in
his
shattered
state
of
health
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
ship
come
in
sight
of
Portsmouth
harbour
,
the
signal
flag
run
up
the
rope
;
the
beloved
Union
Jack
float
triumphantly
over
all
.
<EOS>
return
signal
be
make
from
the
harbour
;
on
board
all
become
bustle
and
preparation
for
landing
;
while
on
shore
there
be
the
evident
movement
of
expectation
,
and
man
in
uniform
be
see
press
their
way
to
the
front
,
as
if
to
them
belong
the
right
of
reception
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
man
from
the
barrack
hospital
,
that
have
be
signal
for
,
come
down
with
ambulance
litter
and
other
mark
of
forethought
for
the
sick
and
wounded
,
who
be
return
to
the
country
for
which
they
have
fight
and
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
dash
and
a
great
rocking
swing
the
vessel
come
up
to
her
appoint
place
,
and
be
safely
moor
.
<EOS>
Philip
sit
still
,
almost
as
if
he
have
no
part
in
the
cry
of
welcome
,
the
bustling
care
,
the
loud
direction
that
cut
the
air
around
him
,
and
pierce
his
nerve
through
and
through
.
<EOS>
but
one
in
authority
give
the
order
;
and
Philip
,
discipline
to
obedience
,
rise
to
find
his
knapsack
and
leave
the
ship
.
<EOS>
Passive
as
he
seem
to
be
,
he
have
his
liking
for
particular
comrade
;
there
be
one
especially
,
a
man
as
different
from
Philip
as
well
could
be
,
to
whom
the
latter
have
always
attach
himself
;
a
merry
fellow
from
Somersetshire
,
who
be
almost
always
cheerful
and
bright
,
though
Philip
have
overhear
the
doctor
<EOS>
say
he
would
never
be
the
man
he
be
<EOS>
before
he
have
that
shoot
through
the
side
.
<EOS>
this
marine
would
often
sit
make
his
fellow
laugh
,
and
laugh
himself
at
his
own
good
-
humoured
joke
,
till
so
terrible
a
fit
of
coughing
come
on
that
those
around
him
fear
he
would
die
in
the
paroxysm
.
<EOS>
after
one
of
these
fit
he
have
gasp
out
some
word
,
which
lead
Philip
to
question
him
a
little
;
and
it
turn
out
that
in
the
quiet
little
village
of
Potterne
,
far
inland
,
nestle
beneath
the
high
stretch
of
Salisbury
Plain
,
he
have
a
wife
and
a
child
,
a
little
girl
,
just
the
same
age
even
to
a
week
as
Philip
's
own
little
Bella
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
that
draw
Philip
towards
the
man
;
and
this
that
make
Philip
wait
and
go
ashore
along
with
the
poor
consumptive
marine
.
  
<EOS>
the
litter
have
move
off
towards
the
hospital
,
the
sergeant
in
charge
have
give
his
word
of
command
to
the
remain
invalid
,
who
try
to
obey
them
to
the
good
of
their
power
,
fall
into
something
like
military
order
for
their
march
;
but
soon
,
very
soon
,
the
weak
broke
step
,
and
lag
behind
;
and
feel
as
if
the
rough
welcome
and
rude
expression
of
sympathy
from
the
crowd
around
be
almost
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
Philip
and
his
companion
be
about
midway
,
when
suddenly
a
young
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arm
force
herself
through
the
people
,
between
the
soldier
who
keep
press
on
either
side
,
and
throw
herself
on
the
neck
of
Philip
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Jem
!
"
she
sob
,
"
I
have
walk
all
the
road
from
Potterne
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
stop
but
for
food
and
rest
for
nelly
,
and
now
I
have
get
you
once
again
<EOS>
,
I
have
get
you
once
again
,
bless
God
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
seem
to
see
the
deadly
change
that
have
come
over
her
husband
since
she
part
with
him
a
ruddy
young
labourer
;
she
have
get
him
once
again
,
as
she
phrase
it
,
and
that
be
enough
for
her
;
she
kiss
his
face
,
his
hand
,
his
very
coat
,
nor
would
she
be
repulse
from
walk
beside
him
and
hold
his
hand
,
while
her
little
girl
run
along
scare
by
the
voice
and
the
strange
face
,
and
cling
to
her
mammy
's
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
coughed
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
cough
his
churchyard
cough
;
and
Philip
bitterly
envy
him
 
envy
his
life
,
envy
his
approach
death
;
for
be
he
not
wrap
round
with
that
woman
's
tender
love
,
and
be
not
such
love
strong
than
death
?
<EOS>
Philip
have
feel
as
if
his
own
heart
be
grow
numb
,
and
as
though
it
have
change
to
a
cold
heavy
stone
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
contrast
of
this
man
's
lot
to
his
own
,
he
feel
that
he
have
yet
the
power
of
suffering
leave
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
road
they
have
to
go
be
full
of
people
,
keep
off
in
some
measure
by
the
guard
of
soldier
.
<EOS>
all
sort
of
kindly
speech
,
and
many
a
curious
question
,
be
address
to
the
poor
invalid
as
they
walk
along
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
jaw
,
and
the
low
part
of
his
face
,
be
bandage
up
;
his
cap
be
slouch
down
;
he
hold
his
cloak
about
him
,
and
shiver
within
its
fold
.
  
<EOS>
They
come
to
a
standstill
from
some
slight
obstacle
at
the
corner
of
a
street
.
<EOS>
down
the
causeway
of
this
street
a
naval
officer
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
be
walk
briskly
,
with
a
step
that
tell
of
health
and
a
light
heart
.
<EOS>
He
stay
his
progress
though
,
when
he
see
the
convoy
of
maimed
and
wounded
man
;
he
say
something
,
of
which
Philip
only
catch
the
word
,
"
same
uniform
,
"
"
for
his
sake
,
"
to
the
young
lady
,
whose
cheek
blanch
a
little
,
but
whose
eye
kindle
.
<EOS>
then
leave
her
for
an
instant
,
he
press
forward
;
he
be
close
to
Philip
,
 
poor
sad
Philip
absorb
in
his
own
thought
,
 
so
absorb
that
he
notice
nothing
till
he
hear
a
voice
at
his
ear
,
have
the
northumbrian
burr
,
the
Newcastle
inflection
which
he
know
of
old
,
and
that
be
to
him
like
the
sick
memory
of
a
deadly
illness
;
and
then
he
turn
his
muffled
face
to
the
speaker
,
though
he
know
well
enough
who
it
be
,
and
avert
his
eye
after
one
sight
of
the
handsome
,
happy
man
,
 
<EOS>
the
man
whose
life
he
have
save
once
,
and
would
save
again
,
at
the
risk
of
his
own
,
but
whom
,
for
all
that
,
he
pray
that
he
may
never
meet
more
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
my
fine
fellow
,
take
this
,
"
force
a
crown
piece
into
Philip
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
be
more
;
I
would
give
you
a
pound
if
I
have
it
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
mutter
something
,
and
hold
out
the
coin
to
Captain
Kinraid
,
of
course
in
vain
;
nor
be
there
time
to
urge
it
back
upon
the
giver
,
for
the
obstacle
to
their
progress
be
suddenly
remove
,
the
crowd
press
upon
the
captain
and
his
wife
,
the
procession
move
on
,
and
Philip
along
with
it
,
hold
the
piece
in
his
hand
,
and
longing
to
throw
it
far
away
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
on
the
point
of
drop
it
,
hope
to
do
so
unperceived
,
when
he
bethink
him
of
give
it
to
Jem
's
wife
,
the
footsore
woman
,
limp
happily
along
by
her
husband
's
side
.
<EOS>
They
thank
him
,
and
speak
in
his
praise
more
than
he
could
well
bear
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
credit
to
him
to
give
that
away
which
burn
his
finger
as
long
as
he
keep
it
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
know
that
the
injury
he
have
receive
in
the
explosion
on
board
the
_
Theseus
_
would
oblige
him
to
leave
the
service
.
<EOS>
He
also
believe
that
they
would
entitle
him
to
a
pension
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
little
interest
in
his
future
life
;
he
be
without
hope
,
and
in
a
depressed
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
He
remain
for
some
little
time
stationary
,
and
then
go
through
all
the
form
of
dismissal
on
account
of
wound
receive
in
service
,
and
be
turn
out
loose
upon
the
world
,
uncertain
where
to
go
,
indifferent
as
to
what
become
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
fine
,
warm
October
weather
as
he
turn
his
back
upon
the
coast
,
and
set
off
on
his
walk
northward
.
<EOS>
green
leave
be
yet
upon
the
tree
;
the
hedge
be
one
flush
of
foliage
and
the
wild
rough
-
flavour
fruit
of
different
kind
;
the
field
be
tawny
with
the
uncleare
-
off
stubble
,
or
emerald
green
with
the
growth
of
the
aftermath
.
<EOS>
the
roadside
cottage
garden
be
gay
with
hollyhock
and
Michaelmas
daisie
and
marigold
,
and
the
bright
pane
of
the
window
glitter
through
a
veil
of
China
rose
.
  
<EOS>
the
war
be
a
popular
one
,
and
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
soldier
and
sailor
be
hero
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
long
drooping
form
,
his
arm
hang
in
a
sling
,
his
face
scar
and
blacken
<EOS>
,
his
jaw
bind
up
with
a
black
silk
handkerchief
;
these
mark
of
active
service
be
reverence
by
the
rustic
cottager
as
though
they
have
be
crown
and
sceptre
.
<EOS>
many
a
hard
-
handed
labourer
leave
his
seat
by
the
chimney
corner
,
and
come
to
his
door
to
have
a
look
at
one
who
have
be
fight
the
French
,
and
push
forward
to
have
a
grasp
of
the
stranger
's
hand
as
he
give
back
the
empty
cup
into
the
good
wife
's
keeping
,
for
the
kind
homely
woman
be
ever
ready
with
milk
or
homebrewe
to
slake
the
feverish
traveller
's
thirst
when
he
stop
at
their
door
and
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
village
public
-
house
he
have
have
a
welcome
of
a
more
interested
character
,
for
the
landlord
know
full
well
that
his
circle
of
customer
would
be
large
that
night
,
if
it
be
only
know
that
he
have
within
his
door
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
who
have
see
service
.
<EOS>
the
rustic
politician
would
gather
round
Philip
,
and
smoke
and
drink
,
and
then
question
and
discuss
till
they
be
drouthy
again
;
and
in
their
sturdy
obtuse
mind
they
set
down
the
extra
glass
and
the
supernumerary
pipe
to
the
score
of
patriotism
.
  
<EOS>
altogether
human
nature
turn
its
sunny
side
out
to
Philip
just
now
;
and
not
before
he
need
the
warmth
of
brotherly
kindness
to
cheer
his
shivering
soul
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
he
drift
northward
,
make
<EOS>
but
the
slow
progress
of
a
feeble
man
,
and
yet
this
short
daily
walk
tire
him
so
much
that
he
long
for
rest
 
for
the
morning
to
come
when
he
need
not
to
feel
that
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
he
must
be
up
and
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
toil
on
with
this
longing
at
his
heart
when
he
see
that
he
be
draw
near
a
stately
city
,
with
a
great
old
cathedral
in
the
centre
keep
solemn
guard
.
<EOS>
this
place
may
be
yet
two
or
three
mile
distant
;
he
be
on
a
rise
ground
look
down
upon
it
.
<EOS>
a
labour
man
pass
by
,
observe
his
pallid
look
and
his
languid
attitude
,
and
tell
him
for
his
comfort
,
that
if
he
turn
down
a
lane
to
the
left
a
few
step
farther
on
,
he
would
find
himself
at
the
Hospital
of
St
Sepulchre
,
where
bread
and
beer
be
give
to
all
comer

and
where
he
may
sit
him
down
and
rest
awhile
on
the
old
stone
bench
within
the
shadow
of
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
obey
these
direction
,
Philip
come
upon
a
building
which
date
from
the
time
of
Henry
the
Fifth
.
<EOS>
some
knight
who
have
fight
in
the
french
war
of
that
time
,
and
have
survive
his
battle
and
come
home
to
his
old
hall
,
have
be
stir
up
by
his
conscience
,
or
by
what
be
equivalent
in
those
day
,
his
confessor
,
to
build
and
endow
a
hospital
for
twelve
decay
soldier
,
and
a
chapel
wherein
they
be
to
attend
the
daily
masse
he
ordain
to
be
say
till
the
end
of
all
time
(
which
eternity
last
rather
more
than
a
century
,
pretty
well
for
an
eternity
bespeak
by
a
man
)
,
for
his
soul
and
the
soul
of
those
whom
he
have
slay
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
division
of
the
quadrangular
building
set
apart
for
the
priest
who
be
to
say
these
masse
;
and
to
watch
over
the
well
-
being
of
the
bedesman
.
<EOS>
in
process
of
year
the
origin
and
primary
purpose
of
the
hospital
have
be
forget
by
all
except
the
local
antiquary
;
and
the
place
itself
come
to
be
regard
as
a
very
pleasant
quaint
set
of
almshouse
;
and
the
warden
's
office
(
he
who
should
have
say
or
sing
<EOS>
his
daily
masse
be
now
call
the

,
and
read
daily
prayer
and
preach
a
sermon
on
Sundays

an
agreeable
sinecure
.
  
<EOS>
another
legacy
of
old
Sir
Simon
Bray
be
that
of
a
small
croft
of
land
,
the
rent
or
profit
of
which
be
to
go
towards
give
to
all
who
ask
for
it
a

of

and
a

<EOS>
this

be

so
Sir

to
be
make
after
a
certain
receipt
which
he
leave
,
in
which
ground
ivy
take
the

<EOS>
but
the

,
as
well
as
the

after

Philip
knock
at

the

He

Philip
sit
down
where
the
warm
October
sun
slant
upon
him
,
and
look
through
the
iron
rail
at
the
peaceful
sight

<EOS>
a
great
square
of
velvet
lawn
,
intersect
diagonally

and
in
many

almost
cover
with

before
each

a
little
plot

bright
with
flower

evidently
tend
with
the
utmost
care
;
on

the
massive

here

there
an

himself
,

leisurely
do
a

talk
to

<EOS>
"
It

say
the
porter
,
interpret
Philip

look
pretty
accurately
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leastways
,
for
them
as
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
bit
weary
on
it
myself
;
it
be
so
far
from
th

world
,
as
a
man
may
say
;
not
a
decent
public
within
a
mile
and
a
half
,
where
one
can
hear
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
news
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
make
myself
very
content
here
,
"
reply
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
to
say
,
if
one
be
easy
in

ay

ay

my

that
be

<EOS>
why
,
I
do
not
think
that
I
could
enjoy
myself
 
not
even
at
th

White
Hart
,
where
they
give
you
as

of

I
could
not

,
flavour
my

there

if
my

a

dying

which
be
a
sign
as
it

not

"
  
<EOS>
just
then
the

back

and
out
come
the

dress
in
full
clerical
costume

<EOS>
He
be
go
into
the
neighbour
city
,
but
he
stop
to
speak
to
Philip
,
the
wound
soldier
;
and
all
the
more
readily
because
his
old
fade
uniform
tell
the
warden

experienced
eye
that
he
have
belong
to
the
Marines

<EOS>
"

kindly

<EOS>
"
You

I
be

<EOS>
"
It
be
my
company

say
Philip
,
warm
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
look
back
upon
his
soldier
's
life
,
it
seem
to
him
to
have
many
charm
,
because
it
be
so
full
of
small
daily
interest

<EOS>
"
then
,
do
you
know
my
son

Lieutenant
Pennington

<EOS>
"
It
be
he
that
give
me
this

when
they
be

back
to

<EOS>
I
have
be
his
servant
for
a
short
time
before
I
be
wound
by
the
explosion
on
board
the
_
Theseus
_
,
and
he
say
I
should
feel
the
cold
of
the
voyage
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
kind
;
and
I
have
hear
say
he
promise
to
be
a
first

rate
officer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
a
slice
of
roast
beef

say
the

ring
the
bell
at

own
back

door

<EOS>
"
I
recognize

how
soon

take
up
a
corner

there

up

<EOS>
and
so
you
be
on

the
_

at
the
time
of
the
explosion

<EOS>
bring
some
cold
meat
here
for
the
good

stay

<EOS>
come
in
with
me
,
and
then
you
can
tell
Mrs.
Pennington
and
the
young
lady
all
you
know
about
Harry
,
 
and
the
siege
,
 
and
the
explosion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Philip
be
usher
into
the
warden
's
house
and
make
to
eat
roast
beef
almost
against
his
will
;
and
he
be
question
and
cross
-
question
by
three
eager
lady
,
all
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
seem
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
all
possible
detail
on
the
subject
about
which
they
be
curious
;
and
be
begin
to
consider
how
he
could
best
make
his
retreat
,
when
the
young
Miss
Pennington
go
up
to
her
father
 
who
have
all
this
time
stand
,
with
his
hat
on
,
hold
his
coat
-
tail
over
his
arm
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
bend
his
ear
down
a
very
little
to
hear
some
whispered
suggestion
of
his
daughter
's
,
nod
his
head
,
and
then
go
on
question
Philip
,
with
kindly
inquisitiveness
and
patronage
,
as
the
rich
do
question
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
you
go
to
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
do
not
answer
directly
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
in
his
own
mind
where
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
say
,
  
"
Northwards
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
shall
never
reach
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
not
you
friend
?
<EOS>
be
not
you
go
to
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
again
a
pause
;
a
cloud
come
over
Philip
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
have
get
any
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
interpret
his
look
and
this
speech
to
mean
that
he
have
either
lose
his
friend
by
death
,
or
offend
them
by
enlist
.
  
<EOS>
the
warden
go
on
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
because
we
have
get
a
cottage
vacant
in
the
mead

<EOS>
Old
Dobson

who
be
with
General
Wolfe
at
the
taking
of
Quebec

die
a
fortnight
ago

<EOS>
with
such
injury
as
yours
,
I
fear
you
will
never
be
able
to
work
again

<EOS>
but
we
require
strict
testimonial
as
to
character
,
"
he
add
,
with
as
penetrate
a
look
as
he
could
summon
up
at
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
look
unmoved
,
either
by
the
offer
of
the
cottage
,
or
the
illusion
to
the
possibility
of
his
character
not
be
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
He
be
grateful
enough
in
reality
,
but
too
heavy
at
heart
to
care
very
much
what
become
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
warden
and
his
family
,
who
be
accustomed
to
consider
a
settlement
at
St
Sepulchre
's
as
the
sum
of
all
good
to
a
wear

out
soldier

be
a
little
annoyed
at
Philip
's
cool
way
of
receive
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
the
warden
go
on
to
name
the
contingent
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
the
cottage
,
you
would
have
a
load
of
wood
for
fire
on
all
saint

on
Christmas
,
and
on
Candlemas
day
 
a
blue
gown
and
suit
of
clothe
to
match
every
Michaelmas
,
and
a
shill
a
day
to
keep
yourself
in
all
other
thing

Your
dinner
you
would
have
with
the
other
man

in
hall

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
warden
himself
go
into
hall
every
day
,
and
see
that
everything
be
comfortable
,
and
say
grace

add
the
warden
's
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
seem
stupid
,
"
say
Philip
,
almost
humbly
,
"
not
to
be
more
grateful
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
far
beyond
what
I
iver
expect
or
think
for
again
,
and
it
be
a
great
temptation
,
for
I
be
just
wear
out
with
fatigue
.
<EOS>
several
time
I
have
think
I
must
lie
down
under
a
hedge
,
and
just
die
for
very
weariness
.
<EOS>
but
once
I
have
a
wife
and
a
child
up
in
the
north
,
"
he
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
they
dead
?
"
<EOS>
ask
one
of
the
young
lady
in
a
soft
sympathizing
tone
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
meet
Philip
's
,
full
of
dumb
woe
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
speak
;
he
want
to
explain
more
fully
,
yet
not
to
reveal
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
the
warden
,
think
he
perceive
the
real
state
of
thing
,
"
what
I
propose
be
this
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
into
old
Dobson
's
house
at
once
,
as
a
kind
of
probationary
bedesman
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
Harry
,
and
get
your
character
from
him
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Freeman
I
think
you
say
your
name
be
?
<EOS>
before
I
can
receive
his
reply
you
will
have
be
able
to
tell
how
you
would
like
the
kind
of
life
;
and
at
any
rate
you
will
have
the
rest
you
seem
to
require
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
take
Harry
's
have
give
you
that
cloak
as
a
kind
of
character
,
"
add
he
,
smile
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
have
to
conform
to
rule
just
like
all
the
rest
,
 
chapel
at
eight
,
dinner
at
twelve
,
light
out
at
nine
;
but
I
will
tell
you
the
remainder
of
our
regulation
as
we
walk
across
quad
to
your
new
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
thus
Philip
,
almost
in
spite
of
himself
,
become
instal
in
a
bedesman
's
house
at
St
Sepulchre
.
    
<EOS>
a
FABLE
<EOS>
at
FAULT
  
<EOS>
Philip
take
possession
of
the
two
room
which
have
belong
to
the
dead
Sergeant
Dobson
.
<EOS>
They
be
furnish
sufficiently
for
every
comfort
by
the
trustee
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
some
little
fragment
of
ornament
,
some
small
article
pick
up
in
distant
country
,
a
few
tattered
book
,
remain
in
the
room
as
legacy
from
their
former
occupant
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
the
repose
of
the
life
and
the
place
be
inexpressibly
grateful
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
shrink
from
encounter
stranger
,
and
display
his
blacken
and
scar
countenance
to
them
,
even
where
such
disfigurement
be
most
regard
as
a
mark
of
honour
.
<EOS>
in
St
Sepulchre
's
he
meet
none
but
the
same
set
day
after
day
,
and
when
he
have
once
tell
the
tale
of
how
it
happen
and
submit
to
their
gaze
,
it
be
over
for
ever
,
if
he
so
minded
.
<EOS>
the
slight
employment
his
garden
give
him
 
there
be
a
kitchen
-
garden
behind
each
house
,
as
well
as
the
flower
-
plot
in
front
 
and
the
daily
arrangement
of
his
parlour
and
chamber
be
,
at
the
beginning
of
his
time
of
occupation
,
as
much
bodily
labour
as
he
could
manage
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
stately
and
utterly
remove
from
all
Philip
's
previous
existence
in
the
form
observe
at
every
day
's
dinner
,
when
the
twelve
bedesman
meet
in
the
large
quaint
hall
,
and
the
warden
come
in
his
college
-
cap
and
gown
to
say
the
long
latin
grace
which
wind
up
with
something
very
like
a
prayer
for
the
soul
of
Sir
Simon
Bray
.
<EOS>
It
take
some
time
to
get
a
reply
to
ship
letter
in
those
time
when
no
one
could
exactly
say
where
the
fleet
may
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
and
before
Dr
Pennington
have
receive
the
excellent
character
of
Stephen
Freeman
,
which
his
son
gladly
send
in
answer
to
his
father
's
inquiry
,
Philip
have
become
restless
and
uneasy
in
the
midst
of
all
this
peace
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
sit
alone
over
his
fire
in
the
long
winter
evening
,
the
scene
of
his
past
life
rise
before
him
;
his
childhood
;
his
aunt
Robson
's
care
of
him
;
his
first
go
to
Foster
's
shop
in
Monkshaven
;
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
the
spelling
lesson
in
the
bright
warm
kitchen
there
;
Kinraid
's
appearance
;
the
miserable
night
of
the
Corneys
'
party
;
the
farewell
he
have
witness
on
Monkshaven
sand
;
the
press
-
gang
,
and
all
the
long
consequence
of
that
act
of
concealment
;
poor
Daniel
Robson
's
trial
and
execution
;
his
own
marriage
;
his
child
's
birth
;
and
then
he
come
to
that
last
day
at
Monkshaven
:
and
he
go
over
and
over
again
the
torture
detail
,
the
look
of
contempt
and
anger
,
the
word
of
loathe
indignation
,
till
he
almost
bring
himself
,
out
of
his
extreme
sympathy
with
Sylvia
,
to
believe
that
he
be
indeed
the
wretch
she
have
consider
him
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
forget
his
own
excuse
for
have
act
as
he
have
do
;
though
these
excuse
have
at
one
time
seem
to
him
to
wear
the
garb
of
reason
.
<EOS>
after
long
thought
and
bitter
memory
come
some
wonder
.
<EOS>
what
be
Sylvia
do
now
?
<EOS>
where
be
she
?
<EOS>
what
be
his
child
like
 
his
child
as
well
as
hers
?
<EOS>
and
then
he
remember
the
poor
footsore
wife
and
the
little
girl
she
carry
in
her
arm
,
that
be
just
the
age
of
Bella
;
he
wish
he
have
notice
that
child
more
,
that
a
clear
vision
of
it
may
rise
up
when
he
want
to
picture
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
he
have
go
round
this
mill
-
wheel
circle
of
idea
till
he
be
weary
to
the
very
marrow
of
his
bone
.
<EOS>
to
shake
off
the
monotonous
impression
he
rise
to
look
for
a
book
amongst
the
old
tattered
volume
,
hope
that
he
may
find
something
that
would
sufficiently
lay
hold
of
him
to
change
the
current
of
his
thought
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
volume
of
_
Peregrine
Pickle
_
;
a
book
of
sermon
;
half
an
army
list
of
1774
,
and
the
_
Seven
Champions
of
Christendom
_
.
<EOS>
Philip
take
up
this
last
,
which
he
have
never
see
before
.
<EOS>
in
it
he
read
how
Sir
Guy
,
Earl
of
Warwick
,
go
to
fight
the
Paynim
in
his
own
country
,
and
be
away
for
seven
long
year
;
and
when
he
come
back
his
own
wife
Phillis
,
the
countess
in
her
castle
,
do
not
know
the
poor
travel
-
wear
hermit
,
who
come
daily
to
seek
his
dole
of
bread
at
her
hand
along
with
many
beggar
and
much
poor
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
,
when
he
lie
a
-
dying
in
his
cave
in
the
rock
,
he
send
for
her
by
a
secret
sign
know
but
to
them
twain
.
<EOS>
and
she
come
with
great
speed
,
for
she
know
it
be
her
lord
who
have
send
for
her
;
and
they
have
many
sweet
and
holy
word
together
before
he
give
up
the
ghost
,
his
head
lie
on
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
story
know
to
most
people
from
their
childhood
be
all
new
and
fresh
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
quite
believe
in
the
truth
of
it
,
because
the
fictitious
nature
of
the
history
of
some
of
the
other
Champions
of
Christendom
be
too
patent
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
help
think
that
this
one
may
be
true
;
and
that
Guy
and
Phillis
may
have
be
as
real
flesh
and
blood
,
long
,
long
ago
,
as
he
and
Sylvia
have
even
be
.
<EOS>
the
old
room
,
the
quiet
moonlit
quadrangle
into
which
the
cross
-
bar
casement
look
,
the
quaint
aspect
of
everything
that
he
have
see
for
week
and
week
;
all
this
predispose
Philip
to
dwell
upon
the
story
he
have
just
be
read
as
a
faithful
legend
of
two
lover
whose
bone
be
long
since
dust
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
if
he
could
thus
see
Sylvia
,
himself
unknown
,
unseen
 
could
live
at
her
gate
,
so
to
speak
,
and
gaze
upon
her
and
his
child
 
some
day
too
,
when
he
lie
a
-
dying
,
he
may
send
for
her
,
and
in
soft
word
of
mutual
forgiveness
breathe
his
life
away
in
her
arm
.
<EOS>
or
perhaps
 
and
so
he
lose
himself
,
and
from
think
,
pass
on
to
dream
.
<EOS>
all
night
long
Guy
and
Phillis
,
Sylvia
and
his
child
,
pass
in
and
out
of
his
vision
;
it
be
impossible
to
make
the
fragment
of
his
dream
cohere
;
but
the
impression
make
upon
him
by
them
be
not
the
less
strong
for
this
.
<EOS>
He
feel
as
if
he
be
call
to
Monkshaven
,
want
at
Monkshaven
,
and
to
Monkshaven
he
resolve
to
go
;
although
when
his
reason
overtake
his
feeling
,
he
know
perfectly
how
unwise
it
be
to
leave
a
home
of
peace
and
tranquillity
and
surround
friendliness
,
to
go
to
a
place
where
nothing
but
want
and
wretchedness
await
him
unless
he
make
himself
know
;
and
if
he
do
,
a
deep
want
,
a
more
woeful
wretchedness
,
would
in
all
probability
be
his
portion
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
small
oblong
of
looking
-
glass
hang
against
the
wall
,
Philip
catch
the
reflection
of
his
own
face
,
and
laugh
scornfully
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
the
thin
hair
lie
upon
his
temple
in
the
flake
that
betoken
long
ill
-
health
;
his
eye
be
the
same
as
ever
,
and
they
have
always
be
consider
the
good
feature
in
his
face
;
but
they
be
sink
in
their
orbit
,
and
look
hollow
and
gloomy
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
low
part
of
his
face
,
blacken
,
contract
,
draw
away
from
his
tooth
,
the
outline
entirely
change
by
the
breakage
of
his
jaw
-
bone
,
he
be
indeed
a
fool
if
he
think
himself
fit
to
go
forth
to
win
back
that
love
which
Sylvia
have
forswear
.
<EOS>
as
a
hermit
and
a
beggar
,
he
must
return
to
Monkshaven
,
and
fall
perforce
into
the
same
position
which
Guy
of
Warwick
have
only
assume
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
should
see
his
Phillis
,
and
may
feast
his
sad
hopeless
eye
from
time
to
time
with
the
sight
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
His
small
pension
of
sixpence
a
day
would
keep
him
from
absolute
want
of
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
so
that
very
day
he
go
to
the
warden
and
tell
him
he
think
of
give
up
his
share
in
the
bequest
of
Sir
Simon
Bray
.
<EOS>
such
a
relinquishment
have
never
occur
before
in
all
the
warden
's
experience
;
and
he
be
very
much
inclined
to
be
offend
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
that
for
a
man
not
to
be
satisfy
as
a
bedesman
of
St
Sepulchre
's
<EOS>
argue
a
very
wrong
state
of
mind
,
and
a
very
ungrateful
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
it
be
not
from
any
ingratitude
,
for
I
can
hardly
feel
thankful
to
you
and
to
Sir
Simon
,
and
to
madam
,
and
the
young
lady
,
and
all
my
comrade
in
the
hospital
,
and
I
niver
expect
to
be
either
so
comfortable
or
so
peaceful
again
,
but
   
'
  
"
<EOS>
but
?
<EOS>
what
can
you
have
to
say
against
the
place
,
then
?
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
what
there
be
always
plenty
of
applicant
for
every
vacancy
;
only
I
think
I
be
do
a
kindness
to
a
man
out
of
Harry
's
company
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
see
Harry
either
;
he
be
get
his
leave
in
March
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
see
the
lieutenant
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
rest
any
longer
so
far
away
from
 
people
I
once
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ten
to
one
they
be
dead
,
or
remove
,
or
something
or
other
by
this
time
;
and
it
will
serve
you
right
if
they
be
.
<EOS>
mind
!
<EOS>
no
one
can
be
choose
twice
to
be
a
bedesman
of
St
Sepulchre
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
warden
turn
away
;
and
Philip
,
uneasy
at
stay
,
dishearten
at
leave
,
go
to
make
his
few
preparation
for
set
out
once
more
on
his
journey
northward
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
give
notice
of
his
change
of
residence
to
the
local
distributor
of
pension
;
and
one
or
two
farewell
have
to
be
take
,
with
more
than
usual
sadness
at
the
necessity
;
for
Philip
,
under
his
name
of
Stephen
Freeman
,
have
attach
some
of
the
old
bedesman
a
good
deal
to
him
,
from
his
unselfishness
,
his
willingness
to
read
to
them
,
and
to
render
them
many
little
service
,
and
,
perhaps
,
as
much
as
anything
,
by
his
habitual
silence
,
which
make
him
a
convenient
recipient
of
all
their
garrulousness
.
<EOS>
so
before
the
time
for
his
departure
come
,
he
have
the
opportunity
of
one
more
interview
with
the
warden
,
of
a
more
friendly
character
than
that
in
which
he
give
up
his
bedesmanship
.
<EOS>
and
so
far
it
be
well
;
and
Philip
turn
his
back
upon
St
Sepulchre
's
with
his
sore
heart
partly
heal
by
his
four
month
'
residence
there
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
strong
,
too
,
in
body
,
more
capable
of
the
day
-
after
-
day
walk
that
be
require
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
save
some
money
from
his
allowance
as
bedesman
and
from
his
pension
,
and
may
occasionally
have
take
an
outside
place
on
a
coach
,
have
it
not
be
that
he
shrink
from
the
first
look
of
every
stranger
upon
his
disfigured
face
.
<EOS>
yet
the
gentle
,
wistful
eye
,
and
the
white
and
faultless
tooth
always
do
away
with
the
first
impression
as
soon
as
people
become
a
little
acquaint
with
his
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
February
when
Philip
leave
St
Sepulchre
's
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
week
in
April
when
he
begin
to
recognize
the
familiar
object
between
York
and
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
begin
to
hang
back
,
and
to
question
the
wisdom
of
what
he
have
do
 
just
as
the
warden
have
prophesy
that
he
would
.
<EOS>
the
last
night
of
his
two
hundred
mile
walk
he
sleep
at
the
little
inn
at
which
he
have
be
enlist
nearly
two
year
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
intention
of
his
that
he
rest
at
that
identical
place
.
<EOS>
night
be
draw
on
;
and
,
in
make
,
as
he
think
,
a
short
cut
,
he
have
miss
his
way
,
and
be
fain
to
seek
shelter
where
he
may
find
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
bring
him
very
straight
face
to
face
with
his
life
at
that
time
,
and
ever
since
.
<EOS>
His
mad
,
wild
hope
 
half
the
result
of
intoxication
,
as
he
now
know
 
all
dead
and
go
;
the
career
then
freshly
opening
shut
up
against
him
now
;
his
youthful
strength
and
health
change
into
premature
infirmity
,
and
the
home
and
the
love
that
should
have
open
wide
its
door
to
console
him
for
all
,
why
in
two
year
death
may
have
be
busy
,
and
take
away
from
him
his
last
feeble
chance
of
the
faint
happiness
of
see
his
belove
without
be
see
or
know
of
her
.
<EOS>
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
,
the
fear
of
Sylvia
's
possible
death
overcloud
his
heart
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
that
he
have
hardly
ever
think
of
this
before
;
so
strange
,
that
now
,
when
the
terror
come
,
it
take
possession
of
him
,
and
he
could
almost
have
swear
that
she
must
be
lie
dead
in
Monkshaven
churchyard
.
<EOS>
or
be
it
little
Bella
,
that
blooming
,
lovely
babe
,
whom
he
be
never
to
see
again
?
<EOS>
there
be
the
tolling
of
mournful
bell
in
the
distant
air
to
his
disturbed
fancy
,
and
the
cry
of
the
happy
bird
,
the
plaintive
bleating
of
the
new
-
drop
lamb
,
be
all
omen
of
evil
import
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
well
as
he
could
,
he
find
his
way
back
to
Monkshaven
,
over
the
wild
height
and
moor
he
have
cross
on
that
black
day
of
misery
;
why
he
should
have
choose
that
path
<EOS>
he
could
not
tell
 
it
be
as
if
he
be
lead
,
and
have
no
free
will
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
soft
clear
evening
be
draw
on
,
and
his
heart
beat
thick
,
and
then
stop
,
only
to
start
again
with
fresh
violence
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
at
the
top
of
the
long
,
steep
lane
that
be
in
some
part
a
literal
staircase
lead
down
from
the
hill
-
top
into
the
High
Street
,
through
the
very
entry
up
which
he
have
pass
when
he
shrink
away
from
his
former
and
his
then
present
life
.
<EOS>
there
he
stand
,
look
down
once
more
at
the
numerous
irregular
roof
,
the
many
stack
of
chimney
below
him
,
seek
out
that
which
have
once
be
his
own
dwelling
 
who
dwell
there
now
?
  
<EOS>
the
yellower
gleam
grow
narrow
;
the
evening
shadow
broad
,
and
Philip
creep
down
the
lane
a
weary
,
woeful
man
.
<EOS>
at
every
gap
in
the
close
-
pack
building
he
hear
the
merry
music
of
a
band
,
the
cheerful
sound
of
excited
voice
.
<EOS>
still
he
descend
slowly
,
scarcely
wonder
what
it
could
be
,
for
it
be
not
associate
in
his
mind
with
the
one
pervade
thought
of
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
the
angle
of
junction
between
the
lane
and
the
High
Street
,
he
seem
plunge
all
at
once
into
the
very
centre
of
the
bustle
,
and
he
draw
himself
up
into
a
corner
of
deep
shadow
,
from
whence
he
could
look
out
upon
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
a
circus
be
make
its
grand
entry
into
Monkshaven
,
with
all
the
pomp
of
colour
and
of
noise
that
it
could
muster
.
<EOS>
trumpeter
in
parti
-
coloured
clothe
ride
first
,
blare
out
triumphant
discord
.
<EOS>
next
come
a
gold
-
and
-
scarlet
chariot
draw
by
six
piebald
horse
,
and
the
winding
of
this
team
through
the
tortuous
narrow
street
be
pretty
enough
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
in
the
chariot
sate
king
and
queen
,
hero
and
heroine
,
or
what
be
mean
for
such
;
all
the
little
boy
and
girl
run
alongside
of
the
chariot
envy
them
;
but
they
themselves
be
very
much
tired
,
and
shiver
with
cold
in
their
heroic
pomp
of
classic
clothing
.
<EOS>
all
this
Philip
may
have
see
;
do
see
,
in
fact
;
but
heed
not
one
jot
.
<EOS>
almost
opposite
to
him
,
not
ten
yard
apart
,
stand
on
the
raise
step
at
the
well
-
know
shop
door
,
be
Sylvia
,
hold
a
child
,
a
merry
dance
child
,
up
in
her
arm
to
see
the
show
.
<EOS>
She
too
,
Sylvia
,
be
laugh
for
pleasure
,
and
for
sympathy
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
hold
the
little
Bella
aloft
that
the
child
may
see
the
gaudy
procession
the
well
and
the
longer
,
look
at
it
herself
with
red
lip
apart
and
white
tooth
glance
through
;
then
she
turn
to
speak
to
some
one
behind
her
 
Coulson
,
as
Philip
see
the
moment
afterwards
;
his
answer
make
her
laugh
once
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
see
it
all
;
her
bonny
careless
look
,
her
pretty
matronly
form
,
her
evident
ease
of
mind
and
prosperous
outward
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
year
that
he
have
spend
in
gloomy
sorrow
,
amongst
wild
scene
,
on
land
or
by
sea
,
his
life
in
frequent
peril
of
a
bloody
end
,
have
go
by
with
her
like
sunny
day
;
all
the
more
sunny
because
he
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
so
bitterly
think
the
poor
disabled
marine
,
as
,
weary
and
despairing
,
he
stand
in
the
cold
shadow
and
look
upon
the
home
that
should
have
be
his
haven
,
the
wife
that
should
have
welcome
him
,
the
child
that
should
have
be
his
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
have
banish
himself
from
his
home
;
his
wife
have
forswear
him
;
his
child
be
blossom
into
intelligence
unwitting
of
any
father
.
<EOS>
wife
,
and
child
,
and
home
,
be
all
do
well
without
him
;
what
madness
have
tempt
him
thither
?
<EOS>
an
hour
ago
,
like
a
fanciful
fool
,
he
have
think
she
may
be
dead
 
dead
with
sad
penitence
for
her
cruel
word
at
her
heart
 
with
mournful
wonder
at
the
unaccounted
-
for
absence

on
her
spirit

and
in
some
measure
cause
the
death
he
have
apprehend

<EOS>
but
to
look
at
her
there
where
she
stand
,
it
do
not
seem
as
if
she
have
have
an
hour
's
painful
thought
in
all
her
blooming
life
.
  
<EOS>
ay
!
go
in
to
the
warm
hearth
,
mother
and
child
,
now
the
gay
cavalcade
have
go
out
of
sight
,
and
the
chill
of
night
have
succeed
to
the
sun
's
setting
.
<EOS>
Husband
and
father
,
steal
out
into
the
cold
dark
street
,
and
seek
some
poor
cheap
lodging
where
you
may
rest
your
weary
bone
,
and
cheat
your
more
weary
heart
into
forgetfulness
in
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
pretty
story
of
the
Countess
Phillis
,
who
mourn
for
her
husband
's
absence
so
long
,
be
a
fable
of
old
time
;
or
rather
say
Earl
Guy
never
wed
his
wife
,
know
that
one
she
love
better
than
him
be
alive
all
the
time
she
have
believe
him
to
be
dead
.
    
<EOS>
the
UNKNOWN
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
before
that
on
which
Philip
arrive
at
Monkshaven
,
Kester
have
come
to
pay
Sylvia
a
visit
.
<EOS>
as
the
early
friend
she
have
,
and
also
as
one
who
know
the
real
secret
of
her
life
,
Sylvia
always
give
him
the
warm
welcome
,
the
cordial
word
,
and
the
sweet
look
in
which
the
old
man
delighted
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
sort
of
delicacy
of
his
own
which
keep
him
from
go
to
see
her
too
often
,
even
when
he
be
stationary
at
Monkshaven
;
but
he
look
forward
to
the
time
when
he
allow
himself
this
pleasure
as
a
child
at
school
look
forward
to
its
holiday
.
<EOS>
the
time
of
his
service
at
Haytersbank
have
,
on
the
whole
,
be
the
happy
in
all
his
long
monotonous
year
of
daily
labour
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
father
have
always
treat
him
with
the
rough
kindness
of
fellowship
;
Sylvia
's
mother
have
never
stint
him
in
his
meat
or
grudge
him
his
share
of
the
good
that
be
go
;
and
once
,
when
he
be
ill
for
a
few
day
in
the
loft
above
the
cow
-
house
,
she
have
make
him
posset
,
and
nurse
him
with
the
same
tenderness
which
he
remember
his
mother
show
to
him
when
he
be
a
little
child
,
but
which
he
have
never
experience
since
then
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
Sylvia
herself
,
as
bud
,
and
sweet
promise
of
blossom
;
and
just
as
she
be
open
into
the
full
-
blow
rose
,
and
,
if
she
have
be
happy
and
prosperous
,
may
have
pass
out
of
the
narrow
circle
of
Kester
's
interest
,
one
sorrow
after
another
come
down
upon
her
pretty
innocent
head
,
and
Kester
's
period
of
service
to
Daniel
Robson
,
her
father
,
be
tragically
cut
short
.
<EOS>
all
this
make
Sylvia
the
great
centre
of
the
faithful
herdsman
's
affection
;
and
Bella
,
who
remind
him
of
what
Sylvia
be
when
first
Kester
know
her
,
only
occupy
the
second
place
in
his
heart
,
although
to
the
child
he
be
much
more
demonstrative
of
his
regard
than
to
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
dress
himself
in
his
Sunday
best
,
and
although
it
be
only
Thursday
,
have
forestall
his
Saturday
's
shaving
;
he
have
provide
himself
with
a
paper
of
humbug
for
the
child
 
<EOS>
"
humbug
"
be
the
north
-
country
term
for
certain
lump
of
toffy
,
well
-
flavour
with
peppermint
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
sit
in
the
accustomed
chair
,
as
near
to
the
door
as
may
be
,
in
Sylvia
's
presence
,
coax
the
little
one
,
who
be
not
quite
sure
of
his
identity
,
to
come
to
him
,
by
open
the
paper
parcel
,
and
let
its
sweet
content
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
like
thee
 
<EOS>
and
yet
she
favour
her
feyth
,
"
say
he
;
and
the
moment
he
have
utter
the
incautious
word
he
look
up
to
see
how
Sylvia
have
take
the
unpremeditated
,
unusual
reference
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
His
stealthy
glance
do
not
meet
her
eye
;
but
though
he
think
she
have
colour
a
little
,
she
do
not
seem
offend
as
he
have
fear
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Bella
have
her
father
's
grave
,
thoughtful
,
dark
eye
,
instead
of
her
mother
's
gray
one
,
out
of
which
the
childlike
expression
of
wonder
would
never
entirely
pass
away
.
<EOS>
and
as
Bella
slowly
and
half
distrustfully
make
her
way
towards
the
temptation
offer
her
,
she
look
at
Kester
with
just
her
father
's
look
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
say
nothing
in
direct
reply
;
Kester
almost
think
she
could
not
have
hear
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
she
say
,
    
"

ask
Kester

so
absorb
in
curiosity

let

say
Sylvia

a
little
surprised
at
Kester
's
evident
discouragement
at
the
prospect

he

often

"
  
<EOS>
"
Can

"
say
Sylvia
,
in
her
eager
way

<EOS>
"
I
should
be
so
glad
;
and
I
have
a

of

<EOS>
"
Nay

Kester
,
"
thou

<EOS>
I
have
leave

I

it

if

I

<EOS>
"
then
I
be

<EOS>
I
niver
justly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Kester
take
his
leave
<EOS>
,
his
mind
set
at
ease
by
Sylvia
's
promise
to
go
and
see
his
sister
pretty
often
during
his
absence
in
the
North
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
's
habit
be
change
since
she
,
as
a
girl
at
Haytersbank
,
like
to
spend
half
her
time
in
the
open
air
,
<EOS>
run
out
perpetually
without
anything
on
to
scatter
crumb
to
the
poultry
,
or
to
take
a
piece
of
bread
to
the
old
cart
-
horse
,
to
go
up
to
the
garden
for
a
handful
of
herb
,
or
to
clamber
to
the
high
point
around
to
blow
the
horn
which
summon
her
father
and
Kester
home
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
live
in
a
town
where
it
be
necessary
to
put
on
hat
and
cloak
before
go
out
into
the
street
,
and
then
to
walk
in
a
steady
and
decorous
fashion
,
she
have
only
care
to
escape
down
to
the
freedom
of
the
sea
-
shore
until
Philip
go
away
;
and
after
that
time
she
have
learn
so
to
fear
observation
as
a
desert
wife
,
that
nothing
but
Bella
's
health
would
have
be
a
sufficient
motive
to
take
her
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
she
have
tell
Kester
,
the
necessity
of
give
the
little
girl
a
daily
walk
be
very
much
lighten
by
the
great
love
and
affection
which
Jeremiah
Foster
now
bear
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
ever
since
the
day
when
the
baby
have
come
to
his
knee
,
allure
by
the
temptation
of
his
watch
,
he
have
apparently
consider
her
as
in
some
sort
belong
to
him
;
and
now
he
have
almost
come
to
think
that
he
have
a
right
to
claim
her
as
his
companion
in
his
walk
back
from
the
Bank
to
his
early
dinner
,
where
a
high
chair
be
always
place
ready
for
the
chance
of
her
come
to
share
his
meal
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
he
generally
bring
her
back
to
the
shop
-
door
when
he
return
to
his
afternoon
's
work
at
the
Bank
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
however
,
he
would
leave
word
that
she
be
to
be
send
for
from
his
house
in
the
New
Town
,
as
his
business
at
the
Bank
for
that
day
be
end
.
<EOS>
then
Sylvia
be
compel
to
put
on
her
thing
,
and
fetch
back
her
darling
;
and
except
for
this
errand
she
seldom
go
out
at
all
on
week
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
after
Kester
's
farewell
call
,
this
need
for
her
visit
to
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
's
arise
;
and
it
seem
to
Sylvia
that
there
could
not
be
a
well
opportunity
of
fulfil
her
promise
and
go
to
see
the
widow
Dobson
,
whose
cottage
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
low
down
on
the
cliff
-
side
,
just
at
the
bend
and
rush
of
the
full
stream
into
the
open
sea
.
<EOS>
She
set
off
pretty
early
in
order
to
go
there
first
.
<EOS>
She
find
the
widow
with
her
house
-
place
tidy
up
after
the
midday
meal
,
and
busy
knitting
at
the
open
door
 
not
look
at
her
rapid
-
click
needle
,
but
gaze
at
the
rush
and
recession
of
the
wave
before
her
;
yet
not
see
them
either
,
 
rather
see
day
long
past
.
  
<EOS>
She
start
into
active
civility
as
soon
as
she
recognize
Sylvia
,
who
be
to
her
as
a
great
lady
,
never
have
know
Sylvia
Robson
in
her
wild
childish
day
.
<EOS>
Widow
Dobson
be
always
a
little
scandalized
at
her
brother
Christopher
's
familiarity
with
Mrs.
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
She
dust
a
chair
which
need
no
dusting
,
and
place
it
for
Sylvia
,
sit
down
herself
on
a
three
-
legged
stool
to
mark
her
sense
of
the
difference
in
their
condition
,
for
there
be
another
chair
or
two
in
the
humble
dwelling
;
and
then
the
two
fall
into
talk
 
first
about
Kester
,
whom
his
sister
would
persist
in
call
Christopher
,
as
if
his
dignity
as
her
eld
brother
be
compromise
by
any
familiar
abbreviation
;
and
by
-
and
<EOS>
-
by
she
open
her
heart
a
little
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
could
wish
as
a'd
learn

-
of

hand
,
"
say
she
;
"
for
a've
that
for
to
tell
Christopher
as
may
set
his
mind
at
ease
.
<EOS>
but
yo
'
see
,
if
a

him
a
letter
he
could
not
read
it
;
so
a
just
comfort

wi
'
thinkin
'
nobody

unless
they'n

<EOS>
but
a
reckon
he
would
ha
'
be
glad
to
hear
as

getten
a
lodger
.
<EOS>
"
here
she
nod
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
door
open
out
of
the
house
-
place
into
the
"
lean

to
"
,
which
Sylvia
have
observe
on
draw
near
the
cottage
,
and
the
recollection
of
the
mention
of
which
by
Kester
have
enable
her
to
identify
widow
Dobson
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
a

yonder
,
"
the

"
<EOS>
He

but
a
do
not

he
be
a
bad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
he
come
?
"
say
Sylvia
,
remember
Kester
's
account
of
his
sister
's
character
,
and
feel
as
though
it
behove
her
,
as
Kester
's
confidante
on
this
head
,
to
give
cautious
and
prudent
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
eh

a

<EOS>
A'm

<EOS>
He

he

he

"
<EOS>
Can

he
,
pant

after

"

a

then
my

misgive
me
,
for
a
thought
he
have
not
a

i

'
t

,
an

if

<EOS>
me

<EOS>
so
he
out
wi

,
an

down
on

"
bout

<EOS>
A'm

he
say
.
<EOS>
then
a
thought
as
a'd
be
a
bit
hard
upon
him
.
<EOS>
an
'

I
,
"
A'm
a
widow

,
and

as

so

,
it
be

puttin

a

as

"
<EOS>
so
he
up
wi

his
hand
afore
his
e'en
,
and
say
not
a

<EOS>
at
last
he

for

"
<EOS>
so
a
be
puzzle

like
<EOS>
;
an

at

a

,
"

so
he
raxe
his

an

a

an

o

<EOS>
as
a
proof
of
this
,
a
sigh
 
almost
a
groan
 
startle
the
two
woman
at
this
very
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor

Sylvia

in

"
there

"
<EOS>
but
after
a
while
,
she
bethink
her
again
of
Kester
's
account
of
his
sister
's
"
softness
"
;
and
she
think
that
it
behove
her
to
give
some
good
advice
.
<EOS>
so
she
add
,
in
a
sterner
,
hard
tone
 
<EOS>
"
still
,
yo

yo're

it

to

I

I

off

FIRST
WORDS
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
spring
of
1800
.
<EOS>
old
people
yet
can
tell
of
the
hard
famine
of
that
year
.
<EOS>
the
harvest
of
the
autumn
before
have
fail
;
the
war
and
the
corn
law
have
bring
the
price
of
corn
up
to
a
famine
rate
;
and
much
of
what
come
into
the
market
be
unsound
,
and
consequently
unfit
for
food
,
yet
hungry
creature
buy
it
eagerly
,
and
try
to
cheat
disease
by
mix
the
damp
,
sweet
,
clammy
flour
with
rice
or
potato
meal
.
<EOS>
rich
family
deny
themselves
pastry
and
all
unnecessary
and
luxurious
use
of
wheat
in
any
shape
;
the
duty
on
hair
-
powder
be
increase
;
and
all
these
palliative
be
but
as
drop
in
the
ocean
of
the
great
want
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
recover
and
grow
strong
;
and
as
he
grow
strong
hunger
take
the
place
of
loathe
dislike
to
food
.
<EOS>
but
his
money
be
all
spend
;
and
what
be
his
poor
pension
of
sixpence
a
day
in
that
terrible
year
of
famine
?
<EOS>
many
a
summer
's
night
he
walk
for
hour
and
hour
round
the
house
which
once
be
his
,
which
may
be
his
now
,
with
all
its
homely
,
blessed
comfort
,
<EOS>
could
he
but
go
and
assert
his
right
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
to
go
with
authority
,
and
in
his
poor
,
maimed
guise
assert
that
right
<EOS>
,
he
have
need
be
other
than
Philip
Hepburn
.
<EOS>
so
he
stand
in
the
old
shelter
of
the
steep
,
crooked
lane
opening
on
to
the
hill
out
of
the
market
-
place
,
and
watch
the
soft
fading
of
the
summer
's
eve
into
night
;
the
closing
of
the
once
familiar
shop
;
the
exit
of
good
,
comfortable
William
Coulson
,
go
to
his
own
home
,
his
own
wife
,
his
comfortable
,
plentiful
supper
.
<EOS>
then
Philip
 
there
be
no
police
in
those
day
,
and
scarcely
an
old
watchman
in
that
primitive
little
town
 
would
go
round
on
the
shady
side
of
street
,
and
,
quickly
glance
about
him
,
cross
the
bridge
,
look
on
the
quiet
,
ripple
stream
,
<EOS>
the
gray
shimmer
foretell
the
come
dawn
over
the
sea
,
the
black
mast
and
rigging
of
the
still
vessel
against
the
sky
<EOS>
;
he
could
see
with
his
wistful
,
eager
eye
the
shape
of
the
window
 
the
window
of
the
very
room
in
which
his
wife
and
child
sleep
,
unheede
of
him
,
the
hungry
,
break
-
hearted
outcast
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
back
to
his
lodging
,
and
softly
lift
the
latch
of
the
door
;
still
more
softly
,
but
never
without
an
unspoken
,
grateful
prayer
,
pass
by
the
poor
sleep
woman
who
have
give
him
a
shelter
and
her
share
of
God
's
blessing
 
she
who
,
like
him
,
know
not
the
feeling
of
satisfied
hunger
;
and
then
he
lay
him
down
on
the
narrow
pallet
in
the
lean
-
to
,
and
again
give
Sylvia
happy
lesson
in
the
kitchen
at
Haytersbank
,
and
the
dead
be
alive
;
and
Charley
Kinraid
,
the
specksioneer
,
have
never
come
to
trouble
the
hopeful
,
gentle
peace
.
  
<EOS>
for
widow
Dobson
have
never
take
Sylvia
's
advice
.
<EOS>
the
tramp
know
to
her
by
the
name
of
Freeman
 
that
in
which
he
receive
his
pension
 
lodge
with
her
still
,
and
pay
his
meagre
shill
in
advance
,
weekly
.
<EOS>
a
shilling
be
meagre
in
those
hard
day
of
scarcity
.
<EOS>
a
hungry
man
may
easily
eat
the
produce
of
a
shilling
in
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
Widow
Dobson
plead
this
to
Sylvia
as
an
excuse
for
keep
her
lodger
on
;
to
a
more
calculate
head
it
may
have
seem
a
reason
for
send
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
see
,
missus
,
"
say
she
,
apologetically
,
to
Sylvia
,
one
evening
,
as
the
latter
call
upon
the
poor
widow
before
go
to
fetch
little
Bella
(
it
be
now
too
hot
for
the
child
to
cross
the
bridge
in
the
full
heat
of
the
summer
sun
,
and
Jeremiah
would
take
her
up
to
her
supper
instead
)
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
see
,
missus
<EOS>
,
there
be
not
a
many
as
'
ud
take
him
in
for
a
shillin
'
when
it
go
so
little
way
;
or
if
they
do
,
they
would
take
it
out
on
him
some
other
way
,
an
'
he
be
not
getten
much
else
,
a
reckon
.
<EOS>
He
ca
be
me
granny
,
but
a'm
vast
mista'en
<EOS>
if
he
be
ten
year
young
nor
me
;
but
he
be
getten
a
fine
appetite
of
his
own
,
choose
how
young
he
may
be
;
an
'
a
can
see
as
he
could
eat
a

more
nor
he
be

to

,
an

<EOS>
eh
,
missus
,
but
yo
'
may
trust
me
a'll
send
him
off
when
time
be
well
;
but
just
now
it
would
be
sendin

him
to
his
death
;
for
a

plenty
and
to

,
thank

to
God
an
'
yo'r
bonny
face

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Sylvia
have
to
be
content
with
the
knowledge
that
the
money
she
gladly
give
to
Kester
's
sister
go
partly
to
feed
the
lodger
who
be
neither
labour
nor
neighbour
,
but
only
just
a
tramp
,
who
,
she
fear
,
be
prey
on
the
good
old
woman
.
<EOS>
still
the
cruel
famine
cut
sharp
enough
to
penetrate
all
heart
;
and
Sylvia
,
an
hour
after
the
conversation
record
above
,
be
much
touch
,
on
her
return
from
Jeremiah
Foster
's
with
the
little
merry
,
chatter
Bella
,
at
see
the
feeble
step
of
one
,
whom
she
know
by
description
must
be
widow
Dobson
's
lodger
,
turn
up
from
the
newly
-
cut
road
which
be
to
lead
to
<EOS>
the
terrace
walk
around
the
North
Cliff
,
a
road
which
lead
to
no
dwelling
but
<EOS>
widow
Dobson
's
.
<EOS>
Tramp
,
and
vagrant
,
he
may
be
in
the
eye
of
the
law
;
but
,
whatever
his
character
,
Sylvia
could
see
him
before
her
in
the
soft
dusk
,
creep
along
,
over
the
bridge
,
often
stop
to
rest
and
hold
by
some
support
,
and
then
go
on
again
towards
the
town
,
to
which
she
and
happy
little
Bella
be
wend
.
  
<EOS>
a
thought
come
over
her
:
she
have
always
fancy
that
this
unknown
man
be
some
fierce
vagabond
,
and
have
dread
lest
in
the
lonely
bit
of
road
between
widow
Dobson
's
cottage
and
the
peopled
highway
,
he
should
fall
upon
her
and
rob
her
if
he
learn
that
she
have
money
with
her
;
and
several
time
she
have
go
away
without
leave
the
little
gift
she
have
intend
,
because
she
imagine
that
she
have
see
the
door
of
the
small
chamber
in
the
"
lean
-
to
"
open
softly
while
she
be
there
,
as
if
the
occupant
(
whom
widow
Dobson
speak
of
as
never
leave
the
house
before
dusk
,
except
once
a
week
)
be
listen
for
the
chink
of
the
coin
in
her
little
leathern
purse
.
<EOS>
now
that
she
see
him
walk
before
her
with
heavy
languid
step
,
this
fear
give
place
to
pity
;
she
remember
her
mother
's
gentle
superstition
which
have
prevent
her
from
ever
send
the
hungry
empty
away
,
for
fear
lest
she
herself
should
come
to
need
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lassie
,
"
say
she
to
little
Bella
,
who
hold
a
cake
which
Jeremiah
's
housekeeper
have
give
her
tight
in
her
hand
,
"
yon
poor
man
theere
be
hungry
;
will
Bella
give
him
her
cake
,
and
mother
will
make
her
another
to
-
morrow
twice
as
big
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
this
consideration
,
and
with
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
which
a
good
supper
not
an
hour
ago
give
even
to
the
hungry
stomach
of
a
child
of
three
year
old
,
Bella
,
after
some
thought
,
graciously
assented
to
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
stop
,
the
cake
in
her
hand
,
and
turn
her
back
to
the
town
,
and
to
the
slow
wayfarer
in
front
.
<EOS>
under
the
cover
of
her
shawl
she
slip
a
half
-
crown
deep
into
the
crumb
of
the
cake
,
and
then
restore
it
to
little
Bella
,
she
give
her
her
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mammy
will
carry
Bella
;
and
when
Bella
go
past
the
poor
man
,
she
shall
give
him
the
cake
over
mammy
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
poor
man
be
so
hungry
;
and
Bella
and
mammy
have
plenty
to
eat
,
and
to
spare
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
's
heart
be
touch
by
the
idea
of
hunger
,
and
her
little
arm
be
outstretche
ready
for
the
moment
her
mother
's
hurried
step
take
her
brush
past
the
startled
,
tremble
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
man
,
eat
this
;
Bella
not
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
the
first
word
he
have
ever
hear
his
child
utter
.
<EOS>
the
echo
of
them
ring
in
his
ear
as
he
stand
endeavour
to
hide
his
disfigured
face
by
look
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
down
upon
the
stream
run
away
towards
the
ocean
,
into
which
his
hot
tear
slowly
fall
,
unheeded
by
the
weeper
.
<EOS>
then
he
change
the
intention
with
which
he
have
set
out
upon
his
nightly
walk
,
and
turn
back
to
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
the
case
be
different
with
Sylvia
;
she
would
have
forget
the
whole
affair
very
speedily
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
little
Bella
's
frequent
recurrence
to
the
story
of
the
hungry
man
,
which
have
touch
her
small
sympathy
with
the
sense
of
an
intelligible
misfortune
.
<EOS>
She
like
to
act
the
dropping
of
the
bun
into
the
poor
man
's
hand
as
she
go
past
him
,
and
would
take
up
any
article
near
her
in
order
to
illustrate
the
gesture
she
have
use
.
<EOS>
one
day
she
get
hold
of
Hester
's
watch
for
this
purpose
,
as
be
of
the
same
round
shape
as
the
cake
;
and
though
Hester
,
for
whose
benefit
the
child
be
repeat
the
story
in
her
broken
language
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
try
to
catch
the
watch
as
it
be
intend
<EOS>
that
she
should
(
she
be
the
representative
of
the
"
hungry
man
"
for
the
time
be
)
,
it
go
to
the
ground
with
a
smash
that
frighten
the
little
girl
,
and
she
begin
to
cry
at
the
mischief
she
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
cry
,
Bella
,
"
say
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
Niver
play
with

.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
thee
at
mine
,
or
I
would
ha

stop
thee
in
time
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
take
it
to
old
Darley
's
on
th

quay

side
,
and
maybe
he
will
soon
set
it
to
right
again
.
<EOS>
only
Bella
must
niver
play
with
watch
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
promise
the
little
sob
child
.
<EOS>
and
that
evening
Hester
take
her
watch
down
to
old
Darley
's
.
  
<EOS>
this
William
Darley
be
the
brother
of
the
gardener
at
the
rectory
;
the
uncle
to
the
sailor
who
have
be
shoot
by
the
press
-
gang
year
before
,
and
to
his
bed
-
ridden
sister
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clever
mechanician
,
and
his
skill
as
a
repairer
of
watch
and
chronometer
be
great
among
the
sailor
,
with
whom
he
do
a
very
irregular
sort
of
traffic
,
conduct
,
often
without
much
use
of
money
,
but
rather
on
the
principle
of
barter
,
they
bring
him
foreign
coin
and
odd
curiosity
pick
up
on
their
travel
in
exchange
for
his
service
to
their
nautical
instrument
or
their
watch
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
ever
have
capital
to
extend
his
business
,
he
may
have
be
a
rich
man
;
but
it
be
to
be
doubt
whether
he
would
have
be
as
happy
as
he
be
now
in
his
queer
little
habitation
of
two
room
,
the
front
one
be
both
shop
and
workshop
,
the
other
serve
the
double
purpose
of
bedroom
and
museum
.
  
<EOS>
the
skill
of
this
odd
-
temper
,
shabby
old
man
be
sometimes
seek
by
the
jeweller
who
keep
the
more
ostentatious
shop
in
the
High
Street
;
but
before
Darley
would
undertake
any
"
tickle
"
piece
of
delicate
workmanship
for
the
other
,
he
sneer
at
his
ignorance
,
and
taunt
and
abuse
him
well
.
<EOS>
yet
he
have
soft
place
in
his
heart
,
and
Hester
Rose
have
find
her
way
to
one
by
her
patient
,
endure
kindness
to
his
bed
-
ride
niece
.
<EOS>
He
never
snarl
at
her
as
he
do
at
too
many
;
and
on
the
few
occasion
when
she
have
ask
him
to
do
anything
for
her
,
he
have
seem
as
if
she
be
confer
the
favour
on
him
,
not
he
on
her
,
and
only
make
the
small
possible
charge
.
  
<EOS>
She
find
him
now
sit
where
he
could
catch
the
most
light
for
his
work
,
spectacle
on
nose
,
and
microscope
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
watch
,
and
examine
it
carefully
without
a
word
in
reply
to
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
open
it
and
take
it
to
piece
,
in
order
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
he
hear
her
catch
her
breath
with
a
check
sound
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
from
above
his
spectacle
;
she
be
hold
a
watch
in
her
hand
which
she
have
just
take
up
off
the
counter
.
  
<EOS>
"

Darley
.

"

<EOS>
yes
,
it
be
those

that

<EOS>
that
Z.

that
she

Zachary

,
Philip

<EOS>
She
know
how
Philip
value
this
watch
.
<EOS>
She
remember
have
see
it
in
his
hand
the
very
day
before
his
disappearance
,
when
he
be
look
at
the
time
in
his
annoyance
at
Sylvia
's
detention
in
her
walk
with
baby
.
<EOS>
Hester
have
no
doubt
that
he
have
take
this
watch
as
a
matter
of
course
away
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
feel
sure
that
he
would
not
part
with
this
relic
of
his
dead
father
on
any
slight
necessity
.
<EOS>
where
,
then
,
be
Philip
?
 
<EOS>
by
what
chance
of
life
or
death
have
this
,
his
value
property
,
find
its
way
once
more
to
Monkshaven
?
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
yo
'
get
this
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
in
as
quiet
a
manner
as
she
could
assume
,
sick
with
eagerness
as
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
to
no
one
else
would
Darley
have
answer
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
mystery
of
most
of
his
dealing
;
not
that
he
have
anything
to
conceal
,
but
simply
because
he
delight
in
concealment
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
out
of
her
hand
,
look
at
the
number
mark
inside
,
and
the
maker
's
name
 
<EOS>
"
Natteau

and
then
reply
,
    
"
a

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Natteau
Gent
have
be
dead
and
in

that

<EOS>
Hester
be
silent

then
Darley
's
heart
relent
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>

Hester
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
well

then

<EOS>
He
be

<EOS>
a'll

<EOS>
so
he
mumble
,
and
mumble
,
but
for
a

that
it
must
need
be

he
be
leave

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

William

"
say
Hester
,
clasp
her
hand
tight
together
.
<EOS>
"
find
out
who

anything
 
everything

I
will
so

.
<EOS>
"
  
Darley
look
at
her
sharply
,
but
with
some
sign
of
sympathy
on
his
grave
face
.
<EOS>
"
My
woman
,
"
he
say
"
a
could
ha

wish
as
you
would
niver

<EOS>
It
be
poor
,
thankless
work
think
too
much
on

o

God
's
creature
.
<EOS>
but
a'll
do
thy
bidding
,
"
he
continue
,
in
a
light
and
different
tone
.
"
<EOS>
A'm
a
'
cute
old
badger
when
need
be
.
<EOS>
come
for
thy
watch
in
a
couple
o
'
day
,
and
a'll
tell
yo
'
all
as
a've
learnt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Hester
go
away
,
her
heart
beat
with
the
promise
of
know
something
about
Philip
,
 
how
much
,
how
little
,
in
these
first
moment
,
she
dare
not
say
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
some
sailor
newly
land
from
distant
sea
may
have
become
possess
of
Philip
's
watch
in
far
-
off
latitude
;
in
which
case
,
Philip
would
be
dead
.
<EOS>
that
may
be
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
think
that
this
be
the
most
probable
way
of
account
for
the
watch
.
<EOS>
She
could
be
certain
as
to
the
positive
identity
of
the
watch
 
be
in
William
Darley
's
possession
.
<EOS>
again
,
it
may
be
that
Philip
himself
be
near
at
hand
 
<EOS>
be
here
in
this
very
place
 
<EOS>
starve
,
as
too
many
be
,
for
insufficiency
of
mean
to
buy
the
high
-
price
food
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
heart
burn
within
her
as
she
think
of
the
succulent
,
comfortable
meal
which
Sylvia
provide
every
day
 
nay
,
three
time
a
day
 
for
the
household
in
the
market
-
place
,
at
the
head
of
which
Philip
ought
to
have
be
;
but
his
place
know
him
not
.
<EOS>
for
Sylvia
have
inherit
her
mother
's
talent
for
housekeeping
,
and
on
her
,
in
Alice
's
decrepitude
and
Hester
's
other
occupation
in
the
shop
,
devolve
the
care
of
due
provision
for
the
somewhat
heterogeneous
family
.
  
<EOS>
and
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
Hester
groan
in
heart
over
the
remembrance
of
Sylvia
's
word
,
"
I
can
niver
forgive
him
the
wrong
he
do
to
me
,
"
that
night
when
Hester
have
come
,
and
clung
to
her
,
make
the
sad
,
shameful
confession
of
her
unreturned
love
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
ever
bring
these
two
together
again
?
<EOS>
Could
hester
herself
 
ignorant
of
the
strange
mystery
of
Sylvia
's
heart
,
as
those
who
be
guide
solely
by
obedience
to
principle
must
ever
be
of
the
clue
to
the
action
of
those
who
be
lead
by
the
passionate
ebb
and
flow
of
impulse
?
<EOS>
Could
hester
herself
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
should
she
speak
,
how
should
she
act
,
if
Philip
be
near
 
if
Philip
be
sad
and
in
miserable
estate
?
<EOS>
Her
own
misery
at
this
contemplation
of
the
case
be
too
great
to
bear
;
and
she
seek
her
usual
refuge
in
the
thought
of
some
text
,
some
promise
of
scripture
,
which
should
strengthen
her
faith
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
God
all
thing
be
possible
,
"
say
she
,
repeat
the
word
as
though
to
lull
her
anxiety
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
yes
;
with
God
all
thing
be
possible
.
<EOS>
but
ofttime
He
do
his
work
with
awful
instrument
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
peacemaker
whose
name
be
death
.
    
<EOS>
SAVED
and
LOST
  
<EOS>
Hester
go
out
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
unknown
owner
of
the
half
-
crown
have
appoint
to
call
for
it
again
at
William
Darley
's
.
<EOS>
She
have
school
herself
to
believe
that
time
and
patience
would
serve
her
good
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
be
to
obtain
all
the
knowledge
about
Philip
that
she
could
in
the
first
instance
;
and
then
,
if
circumstance
allow
it
,
as
in
all
probability
they
would
,
to
let
drop
by
drop
of
healing
,
peacemake
word
and
thought
fall
on
Sylvia
's
obdurate
,
unforgive
heart
.
<EOS>
so
Hester
put
on
her
thing
,
and
go
out
down
towards
the
old
quay
-
side
on
that
evening
after
the
shop
be
close
.
  
<EOS>
poor
little
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
She
be
unforgive
,
but
not
obdurate
to
the
full
extent
of
what
Hester
believe
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
since
Philip
go
away
have
she
unconsciously
miss
his
protect
love
;
when
folk
speak
shortly
to
her
,
when
Alice
scold
her
as
one
of
the
non
-
elect
,
when
Hester
's
gentle
gravity
have
something
of
severity
in
it
;
when
her
own
heart
fail
her
as
to
whether
her
mother
would
have
judge
that
she
have
do
well
,
could
that
mother
have
know
all
,
as
possibly
she
do
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
never
speak
otherwise
than
tenderly
to
her
during
the
eighteen
month
of
their
married
life
,
except
on
the
two
occasion
before
record
:
once
when
she
refer
to
her
dream
of
Kinraid
's
possible
return
,
and
once
again
on
the
evening
of
the
day
before
her
discovery
of
his
concealment
of
the
secret
of
Kinraid
's
involuntary
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
after
she
have
learn
that
Kinraid
be
marry
,
her
heart
have
still
more
strongly
turn
to
Philip
;
she
think
that
he
have
judge
rightly
in
what
he
have
give
as
the
excuse
for
his
double
dealing
;
she
be
even
more
indignant
at
Kinraid
's
fickleness
than
she
have
any
reason
to
be
;
and
she
begin
to
learn
the
value
of
such
enduring
love
as
Philip
's
have
be
 
last
ever
since
the
day
when
she
first
begin
to
fancy
what
a
man
's
love
for
a
woman
should
be
,
when
she
have
first
shrink
from
the
tone
of
tenderness
he
put
into
his
especial
term
for
her
,
a
girl
of
twelve
 
"
little
lassie
,
"
as
he
be
will
not
to
call
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
across
all
this
relenting
come
the
shadow
of
her
<EOS>
vow
 
like
the
chill
of
a
great
cloud
pass
over
a
sunny
plain
.
<EOS>
how
should
she
decide
?
<EOS>
what
would
be
her
duty
,
if
he
come
again
,
and
once
more
call
her
"
wife
"
?
<EOS>
She
shrink
from
such
a
possibility
with
all
the
weakness
and
superstition
of
her
nature
;
and
this
<EOS>
it
be
which
make
her
strengthen
herself
with
the
re
-
utterance
of
unforgive
word
;
and
shun
all
recurrence
to
the
subject
on
the
rare
occasion
when
Hester
have
try
to
bring
it
back
,
with
a
hope
of
soften
the
heart
which
to
her
appear
altogether
harden
on
this
one
point
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
on
this
bright
summer
evening
,
while
Hester
have
go
down
to
the
quay
-
side
,
Sylvia
stand
with
her
out
-
of
-
door
thing
on
in
the
parlour
,
rather
impatiently
watch
the
sky
,
full
of
hurry
cloud
,
and
flush
with
the
warm
tint
of
the
approach
sunset
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
leave
Alice
:
the
old
woman
have
grow
so
infirm
that
she
be
never
leave
by
her
daughter
and
Sylvia
at
the
same
time
;
yet
Sylvia
have
to
fetch
her
little
girl
from
the
New
Town
,
where
she
have
be
to
her
supper
at
Jeremiah
Foster
's
.
<EOS>
Hester
have
say
that
she
should
not
be
away
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
Hester
be
generally
so
punctual
that
any
failure
of
her
,
in
this
respect
,
appear
almost
in
the
light
of
an
injury
on
those
who
have
learn
to
rely
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
want
to
go
and
see
widow
Dobson
,
and
learn
when
Kester
may
be
expect
home
.
<EOS>
His
two
month
be
long
past
;
and
Sylvia
have
hear
through
the
foster
of
some
suitable
and
profitable
employment
for
him
,
of
which
she
think
he
would
be
glad
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
some
time
since
she
have
be
able
to
get
so
far
as
across
the
bridge
;
and
,
for
aught
she
know
,
Kester
may
already
be
come
back
from
his
expedition
to
the
Cheviots
.
<EOS>
Kester
be
come
back
.
<EOS>
scarce
five
minute
have
elapse
after
these
thought
have
pass
through
her
mind
before
his
hasty
hand
lift
the
latch
of
the
kitchen
-
door
,
his
hurried
step
bring
him
face
to
face
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
smile
of
greeting
be
arrest
on
her
lip
by
one
look
at
him
:
his
eye
stare
wide
,
the
expression
on
his
face
wild
,
and
yet
pitiful
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
reet
,
"
say
he
,
see
that
her
thing
be
already
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou're
want
sore
.
<EOS>
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
dear
God
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
"
cry
Sylvia
,
clutch
at
the
chair
near
her
;
but
recover
her
eddy
sense
with
the
strong
fact
before
her
that
whatever
the
terror
be
,
she
be
need
to
combat
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
;
thy
child
!

stand
about

two

in

in

when
Sylvia
draw
near
the
man
fall
back
;
and
the
woman
move
aside
as
though
to
allow
her
to
pass
,
all
look
upon
her
with
a
certain
amount
of
sympathy

perhaps
with
rather
more
of
antagonistic
wonder

for

much
of

any
distrust
of
him
as
a
stranger

a
tramp
be
quite
forget
now

<EOS>
Sylvia
feel
the
hardness
of
their
look
,
the
hardness
of
their
silence
;
but
it
be
as
nothing
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
such
thing
could
have
touch
her
at
this
moment
,
she
would
not
have
stand
still
right
in
the
midst
of
their
averted
heart
,
and
murmur
something
to
Kester
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hear
the
word
utter
by
that
hoarse
choke
voice
,
until
he
have
stoop
down
and
bring
his
ear
to
the
level
of
her
mouth
.

"
We
would
better
wait

again

She
stand
by
the
door
,
shiver
all
over
,
almost
face
the
people
in
the
road
,
but
with
her
face
turn
a
little
to
the
right
,
so
that
they
think
she
be
look
at
the
pathway
on
the
cliff
-
side
,
a
hundred
yard
<EOS>
or
so
distant
,
below
which
the
hungry
wave
still
lash
themselves
into
high
ascend
spray

while
near
to
the
cottage

where
their
force

break
by

bar
at

entrance

softly
lap
up
the
shelving
shore

Sylvia
see
nothing
of
all
this
,
though
it
be
straight
before
her
eye

<EOS>
She
only
see
a
blurred
mist
;
she
hear
no
sound
of
water
,
though
it
fill
the
ear
of
those
around

<EOS>
instead
she
hear
low
whisper
pronounce
Philip
's
earthly
doom
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
doctor
be
both
agree
;
his
internal
injury
be
of
a
mortal
kind
,
although
,
as
the
spine
be
severely
injure
above
the
seat
of
the
fatal
bruise

he
have
no
pain
in

low
half
of

They
have
speak
in

low
a
tone
that
John

stand
only
a
foot
or
so
away
,
have
not
be
able
to
hear
their
word
.
<EOS>
but
Sylvia
hear
each
syllable
there
where
she
stand
outside
,
shiver
all
over
in
the
sultry
summer
evening

She
turn
round
to
Kester

She
speak
in

calm
voice
;
and
he
,
not
know
what
she
have
hear
,
make
some
easy
conditional
promise
.
<EOS>
then
those
opposite
to
the
cottage
door
fall
back
,
for
they
could
see
the
grave
doctor
come
out
,
and
John
Foster
,
graver
,
sadder
still
,
follow
them
.
<EOS>
without
a
word
to
them
,
 
without
a
word
even
of
inquiry
 
which
many
outside
think
and
speak
of
as
strange
 
white

faced

dry

eyed

slip
into
the
house
out
of
their
sight

shake
her
head
as

steal
in
 
white
,
noiseless
,
and
upborne
from

<EOS>
but
noiseless
as
her
step
may
be
,
he
hear
,
he
recognize
,
and
with
a
sigh
he
turn
his
poor
disfigure
face
to
the
wall
,
hide
it
in
the
shadow

<EOS>
He

at

speak
with
an
effort

<EOS>
there
be
no
answer
,
only
a
long
miserable
sigh
,
and
he
feel
her
soft
cheek
lay
upon
his
hand
,
and
the
quiver
that
run
through
her
whole
body

He
hear
through
the
open
window
the
wave
lap
on

there
come
no

her
with
gentle
,
caress
hand

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
little

<EOS>
he
say
,
after
a
while
when
she
be
quiet
from
very
exhaustion
,
<EOS>
"
I
niver
think
to

so
happy
again

<EOS>
God

<EOS>
She
lift
up
her
head
,
and
ask
wildly
,
"
Will
He

I

I

<EOS>
I
think
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
Philip
,
turn
round
his
face
,
forgetful
of
himself
in
his
desire
to
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
pity
us
as
a
father
pity
his
poor
wander
child
;
the
nearer
I
come
to
death
the
clear
I
see
Him
.
<EOS>
but
you
and
me
have
do
wrong
to
each
other
;
yet
we
can
see
now
how
we
be
lead
to
it
;
we
can
pity
and
forgive
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
be
get
low
and
faint
,
lassie
;
but
thou
must
remember
this
:
God
know
more
,
and
be
more
forgiving
than
either
you
to
me
,
or
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
and
do
believe
as
we
shall
meet
together
before
His
face
;
but
then
I
shall
ha
'
learn
to
love
thee
second
to
Him
;
not
first
,
as
I
have
do
here
upon
the
earth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
be
silent
 
very
still
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
know
 
widow
Dobson
have
bring
it
in
 
that
there
be
some
kind
of
medicine
,
send
by
the
hopeless
doctor
,
lie
upon
the
table
hard
by
,
and
she
softly
rise
and
pour
it
out
and
drop
it
into
the
half
-
open
mouth
.
<EOS>
then
she
kneel
down
again
,
hold
the
hand
feebly
stretch
out
to
her
,
and
watch
the
faint
light
in
the
wistful
loving
eye
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
stillness
she
hear
the
ceaseless
wave
lap
against
the
shelving
shore
.
  
<EOS>
something
like
an
hour
before
this
time
,
which
be
the
deep
midnight
of
the
summer
's
night
,
Hester
Rose
have
come
hurry
up
the
road
to
where
Kester
and
his
sister
sate
outside
the
open
door
,
keep
their
watch
under
the
star
-
light
sky
,
all
other
have
go
away
,
one
by
one
,
even
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
have
return
to
their
own
house
,
where
the
little
Bella
lie
,
sleep
a
sound
and
healthy
slumber
after
her
perilous
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
have
hear
but
little
from
William
Darley
as
to
the
owner
of
the
watch
and
the
half
-
crown
;
but
he
be
chagrin
at
the
failure
of
all
his
skilful
interrogation
to
elicit
the
truth
,
and
promise
her
further
information
in
a
few
day
,
with
all
the
more
vehemence
because
he
be
unaccustomed
to
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
and
Hester
have
again
whisper
to
herself
"
Patience
!
<EOS>
patience
!
"
and
have
slowly
return
back
to
her
home
to
find
that
Sylvia
have
leave
it
,
why
she
do
not
at
once
discover
.
<EOS>
but
,
grow
uneasy
as
the
advance
hour
neither
bring
Sylvia
nor
little
Bella
to
their
home
,
she
have
set
out
for
Jeremiah
Foster
be
as
soon
as
she
have
see
her
mother
comfortably
asleep
in
her
bed
;
and
then
she
have
learn
the
whole
story
,
bit
by
bit
,
as
each
person
who
speak
break
in
upon
the
previous
narration
with
some
new
particular
.
<EOS>
but
from
no
one
do
she
clearly
learn
whether
Sylvia
be
with
her
husband
,
or
not
;
and
so
she
come
speed
along
the
road
,
breathless
,
to
where
Kester
sate
in
<EOS>
wakeful
,
mournful
silence
,
his
sister
's
sleep
head
lie
on
his
shoulder
,
the
cottage
door
open
,
both
for
air
and
that
there
may
be
help
within
call
if
need
;
and
the
dim
slanting
oblong
of
the
interior
light
lie
across
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
come
pant
up
,
too
agitated
and
breathless
to
ask
how
much
be
truth
of
the
fatal
,
hopeless
tale
which
she
have
hear
.
<EOS>
Kester
look
at
her
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
through
this
solemn
momentary
silence
the
lapping
of
the
ceaseless
wave
be
hear
,
as
they
come
up
close
on
the
shelving
shore
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
?
<EOS>
Philip
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
Kester
shake
his
head
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
his
wife
 
Sylvia
?
"
say
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
there
with
him
,
alone
,
"
whisper
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
turn
away
,
and
wring
her
hand
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lord
God
Almighty
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
"
be
I
not
even
worthy
to
bring
them
together
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
she
go
away
slowly
and
heavily
back
to
the
side
of
her
sleep
mother
.
<EOS>
but
"
Thy
will
be
do
"
be
on
her
quivering
lip
before
she
lie
down
to
her
rest
.
  
<EOS>
the
soft
gray
dawn
lighten
the
darkness
of
a
midsummer
night
soon
after
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Philip
watch
it
come
,
know
that
it
be
his
last
sight
of
day
,
 
as
we
reckon
day
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
often
near
death
as
a
soldier
;
once
or
twice
,
as
when
he
rush
into
fire
to
save
Kinraid
,
his
chance
of
life
have
be
as
one
to
a
hundred
;
but
yet
he
have
have
a
chance
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
the
new
feeling
 
the
last
new
feeling
which
we
shall
any
of
us
experience
in
this
world
 
that
death
be
not
only
close
at
hand
,
but
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
He
feel
its
numbness
steal
up
him
 
steal
up
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
head
be
clear
,
the
brain
more
than
commonly
active
in
produce
vivid
impression
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
but
yesterday
since
he
be
a
little
boy
at
his
mother
's
knee
,
wish
with
all
the
earnestness
of
his
childish
heart
to
be
like
Abraham
,
who
be
call
the
friend
of
God
,
or
David
,
who
be
say
to
be
the
man
after
God
's
own
heart
,
or
St
John
,
who
be
call
"
the
Beloved
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
very
present
seem
the
day
on
which
he
make
resolution
of
try
to
be
like
them
;
it
be
in
the
spring
,
and
some
one
have
bring
in
cowslip
;
and
the
scent
of
those
flower
be
in
his
nostril
now
,
as
he
lie
a
-
dying
 
<EOS>
his
life
end
,
his
battle
fight
,
his
time
for
"
be
good
"
over
and
go
 
the
opportunity
,
once
give
in
all
eternity
,
past
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
temptation
that
have
beset
him
rise
clearly
before
him
;
the
scene
themselves
stand
up
in
their
solid
materialism
 
he
could
have
touch
the
place
;
the
people
,
the
thought
,
the
argument
that
Satan
have
urge
in
behalf
of
sin
,
be
reproduce
with
the
vividness
of
a
present
time
.
<EOS>
and
he
know
that
the
thought
be
illusion
,
the
argument
false
and
hollow
;
for
in
that
hour
come
the
perfect
vision
of
the
perfect
truth
:
he
see
the
"
way
to
escape
"
which
have
come
along
with
the
temptation
;
now
,
the
strong
resolve
of
an
ardent
boyhood
,
with
all
a
life
before
it
to
show
the
world
"
what
a
Christian
may
be
"
;
and
then
the
swift
,
terrible
now
,
when
his
naked
,
guilty
soul
shrink
into
the
shadow
of
God
's
mercy
-
seat
,
out
of
the
blaze
of
His
anger
against
all
those
who
act
a
lie
.
  
<EOS>
His
mind
be
wander
,
and
he
pluck
it
back
.
<EOS>
be
this
death
in
very
deed
?
<EOS>
He
try
to
grasp
at
the
present
,
the
earthly
present
,
fade
quick
away
.
<EOS>
He
lie
there
on
the
bed
 
on
Sally
Dobson
's
bed
in
the
house
-
place
,
not
on
his
accustomed
pallet
in
the
lean
-
to
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
much
.
<EOS>
and
the
door
be
open
into
the
still
,
dusk
night
;
and
through
the
open
casement
he
could
hear
the
lapping
of
the
wave
on
the
shelving
shore
,
could
see
the
soft
gray
dawn
over
the
sea
 
<EOS>
he
know
it
be
over
the
sea
 
<EOS>
he
see
what
lie
unseen
behind
the
poor
wall
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
Sylvia
who
hold
his
hand
tight
in
her
warm
,
living
grasp
;
it
be
his
wife
whose
arm
be
throw
around
him
,
whose
sob
sigh
shake
his
numbed
frame
from
time
to
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
and
comfort
my
darling
,
"
he
say
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
She
know
me
now
.
<EOS>
all
will
be
right
in
heaven
 
in
the
light
of
God
's
mercy
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
try
to
remember
all
that
he
have
ever
read
about
,
God
,
and
all
that
the
bless
Christ
 
that
bringeth
glad
tiding
of
great
joy
unto
all
people
,
have
say
of
the
Father
,
from
whom
He
come
.
<EOS>
those
saying
drop
like
balm
down
upon
his
troubled
heart
and
brain
.
<EOS>
He
remember
his
mother
,
and
how
she
have
love
him
;
and
he
be
go
to
a
love
wiser
,
tender
,
deep
than
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
think
this
,
he
move
his
hand
as
if
to
pray
;
but
Sylvia
clench
her
hold
,
and
he
lie
still
,
pray
all
the
same
for
her
,
for
his
child
,
and
for
himself
.
<EOS>
then
he
see
the
sky
redden
with
the
first
flush
of
dawn
;
he
hear
Kester
's
long
-
draw
sigh
of
weariness
outside
the
open
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
see
widow
Dobson
pass
through
long
before
to
keep
the
remainder
of
her
watch
on
the
bed
in
the
lean
-
to
,
which
have
be
his
for
many
and
many
a
sleepless
and
tearful
night
.
<EOS>
those
night
be
over
 
he
should
never
see
that
poor
chamber
again
,
though
it
be
scarce
two
foot
distant
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
lose
all
sense
of
the
comparative
duration
of
time
:
it
seem
as
long
since
kind
Sally
Dobson
have
bent
over
him
with
soft
,
linger
look
,
before
go
into
the
humble
sleeping
-
room
 
as
long
as
it
be
since
his
boyhood
,
when
he
stand
by
his
mother
dream
of
the
life
that
should
be
his
,
with
the
scent
of
the
cowslip
tempt
him
to
be
off
to
the
woodland
where
they
grow
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
a
rush
and
an
eddying
through
his
brain
 
his
soul
try
her
wing
for
the
long
flight
.
<EOS>
again
he
be
in
the
present
<EOS>
:
he
hear
the
wave
lap
against
the
shelving
shore
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
his
thought
come
back
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
once
more
he
speak
aloud
,
in
a
strange
and
terrible
voice
,
which
be
not
his
.
<EOS>
every
sound
come
with
effort
that
be
new
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
wife
!
<EOS>
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
once
more
 
forgive
me
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
spring
up
,
she
kiss
his
poor
burn
lip
;
she
hold
him
in
her
arm
,
she
moan
,
and
say
,
  
"
oh
,
wicke
me
!
<EOS>
forgive
me
 
me
 
Philip
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
speak
,
and
say
,
"
Lord
,
forgive
us
our
trespass
as
we
forgive
each
other
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
that
the
power
of
speech
be
conquer
by
the
come
death
.
<EOS>
He
lie
very
still
,
his
consciousness
fast
fade
away
,
yet
come
back
in
throbs
,
so
that
he
know
it
be
Sylvia
who
touch
his
lip
with
cordial
,
and
that
it
be
Sylvia
who
murmur
word
of
love
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
sleep
at
last
,
and
so
he
do
 
a
kind
of
sleep
,
but
the
light
of
the
red
morning
sun
fall
on
his
eye
,
and
with
one
strong
effort
he
rise
up
,
and
turn
so
as
once
more
to
see
his
wife
's
pale
face
of
misery
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
heaven
,
"
he
cry
,
and
a
bright
smile
come
on
his
face
,
as
he
fall
back
on
his
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
not
long
after
Hester
come
,
the
little
Bella
scarce
awake
in
her
arm
,
with
the
purpose
of
bring
his
child
to
see
him
ere
<EOS>
yet
he
pass
away
.
<EOS>
Hester
have
watch
and
pray
through
the
livelong
night
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
find
him
dead
,
and
Sylvia
,
tearless
and
almost
unconscious
,
lie
by
him
,
her
hand
hold
his
,
her
other
throw
around
him
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
,
poor
old
man
,
be
sob
bitterly
;
but
she
not
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
then
Hester
bear
her
child
to
her
,
and
Sylvia
open
wide
her
miserable
eye
,
and
only
stare
,
as
if
all
sense
be
go
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
Bella
suddenly
rouse
up
at
the
sight
of
the
poor
,
scar
,
peaceful
face
,
cry
out
,
    
"
poor
man
who
be
so
hungry
.
<EOS>
be
he
not
hungry
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Hester
,
softly
.
<EOS>
"
the
former
thing
be
pass
away
 
and
he
be
go
where
there
be
no
more
sorrow
,
and
no
more
pain
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
then
she
break
down
into
weeping
and
crying
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sit
up
and
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
yo
'
cry
,
Hester
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
niver
say
that
yo

would
not
forgive
him
as
long
as
yo

live
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
niver
break
the
heart
of
him
that
love
yo
'
,
and
let
him
almost
starve
at
yo'r
very
door
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
my
Philip
,
tender
and
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
Hester
come
round
and
close
the
sad
half
-
open
eye
;
kiss
the
calm
brow
with
a
long
farewell
kiss
.
<EOS>
as
she
do
so
,
her
eye
fall
on
a
black
ribbon
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
She
partly
lift
it
out
;
to
it
be

stand
near
the
site
of
widow
Dobson
's
house
on
a
summer
's
night
,
at
the
ebb
of
a
spring

tide
,
you
may
hear
the
wave
come
lap
up
the
shelving
shore
with
the

ceaseless
,
ever

recurrent
sound
as
that
which
Philip

to
in
the
pause
between

the

die
of
starvation
while
his

in
hard

hearted
plenty
not
