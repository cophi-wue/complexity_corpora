<EOS>
no
house
of
public
entertainment
in
the
United
Kingdom
greatly
care
for
my
opinion
of
its
brandy
or
sherry
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
upon
my
journey
,
I
be
not
usually
rate
at
a
low
figure
in
the
bill
;
when
I
come
home
from
my
journey
,
I
never
get
any
commission
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
about
price
,
and
should
have
no
idea
,
if
I
be
put
to
it
,
how
to
wheedle
a
man
into
order
something
he
do
not
want
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
town
traveller
,
I
be
never
to
be
see
drive
a
vehicle
externally
like
a
young
and
volatile
pianoforte
van
,
and
internally
like
an
oven
in
which
a
number
of
flat
box
be
bake
in
layer
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
country
traveller
,
I
be
rarely
to
be
find
in
a
gig
,
and
be
never
to
be
encounter
by
a
pleasure
train
,
wait
on
the
platform
of
a
branch
station
,
quite
a
druid
in
the
midst
of
a
light
Stonehenge
of
sample
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
---
proceed
now
,
to
introduce
myself
positively
---
I
be
both
a
town
traveller
and
a
country
traveller
,
and
be
always
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
figuratively
speak
,
I
travel
for
the
great
house
of
Human
Interest
Brothers
,
and
have
rather
a
large
connection
in
the
fancy
good
way
.
 
<EOS>
literally
speak
,
I
be
always
wander
here
<EOS>
and
there
from
my
room
in
covent
-
garden
,
London
---
<EOS>
now
about
the
city
street
:
 
now
,
about
the
country
by
-
road
---
see
many
little
thing
,
and
some
great
thing
,
which
,
because
they
interest
me
,
I
think
may
interest
other
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
my
chief
credential
as
the
Uncommercial
Traveller
.
  
<EOS>
the
Shipwreck
 
<EOS>
never
have
I
see
a
year
go
out
,
or
go
on
,
under
quieter
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
-
nine
have
but
another
day
to
live
,
and
truly
its
end
be
peace
on
that
sea
-
shore
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
so
settle
and
orderly
be
everything
seaward
,
in
the
bright
light
of
the
sun
and
under
the
transparent
shadow
of
the
cloud
,
that
it
be
hard
to
imagine
the
bay
otherwise
,
for
year
past
or
to
come
,
than
it
be
that
very
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
Tug
-
steamer
lie
a
little
off
the
shore
,
the
Lighter
lie
still
near
to
the
shore
,
the
boat
alongside
the
Lighter
,
the
regularly
-
turn
windlass
aboard
the
Lighter
,
the
methodical
figure
at
work
,
all
slowly
and
regularly
heave
up
and
down
with
the
breathing
of
the
sea
,
all
seem
as
much
a
part
of
the
nature
of
the
place
as
the
tide
itself
.
 
<EOS>
the
tide
be
on
the
flow
,
and
have
be
for
some
two
hour
and
a
half
;
there
be
a
slight
obstruction
in
the
sea
within
a
few
yard
of
my
foot
:
 
as
if
the
stump
of
a
tree
,
with
earth
enough
about
it
to
keep
it
from
lie
horizontally
on
the
water
,
have
slip
a
little
from
the
land
---
and
as
I
stand
upon
the
beach
and
observe
it
dimple
the
light
swell
that
be
come
in
,
I
cast
a
stone
over
it
.
   
<EOS>
so
orderly
,
so
quiet
,
so
regular
---
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
Tug
-
steamer
,
the
Lighter
,
and
the
boat
---
<EOS>
the
turning
of
the
windlass
---
<EOS>
the
come
in
of
the
tide
---
that
I
myself
seem
,
to
my
own
thinking
,
anything
but
new
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
I
have
never
see
it
in
my
life
,
a
minute
before
,
and
have
traverse
two
hundred
mile
to
get
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
very
morning
I
have
come
bowl
down
,
and
struggle
up
,
hill
-
country
road
;
look
back
at
snowy
summit
;
meet
courteous
peasant
well
to
do
,
drive
fat
pig
and
cattle
to
market
:
 
note
the
neat
and
thrifty
dwelling
,
with
their
unusual
quantity
of
clean
white
linen
,
dry
on
the
bush
;
have
windy
weather
suggest
by
every
cotter
's
little
rick
,
with
its
thatch
straw
-
ridge
and
extra
straw
-
ridge
into
overlap
compartment
like
the
back
of
a
rhinoceros
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
not
give
a
lift
of
fourteen
mile
to
the
Coast
-
guardsman
(
kit
and
all
)
,
who
be
come
to
his
spell
of
duty
there
,
and
have
we
not
just
now
part
company
?
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
;
but
the
journey
seem
to
glide
down
into
the
placid
sea
,
with
other
chafe
and
trouble
,
and
for
the
moment
nothing
be
so
calmly
and
monotonously
real
under
the
sunlight
as
the
gentle
rise
and
fall
of
the
water
with
its
freight
,
the
regular
turning
of
the
windlass
aboard
the
Lighter
,
and
the
slight
obstruction
so
very
near
my
foot
.
   
<EOS>
o
reader
,
haply
turn
this
page
by
the
fireside
at
home
,
and
hear
the
night
wind
rumble
in
the
chimney
,
that
slight
obstruction
be
the
uppermost
fragment
of
the
Wreck
of
the
Royal
Charter
,
australian
trader
and
passenger
ship
,
Homeward
bind
,
that
strike
here
on
the
terrible
morning
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
this
October
,
break
into
three
part
,
go
down
with
her
treasure
of
at
least
five
hundred
human
life
,
and
have
never
stir
since
!
   
<EOS>
from
which
point
,
or
from
which
,
she
drive
ashore
,
stern
foremost
;
on
which
side
,
or
on
which
,
she
pass
the
little
Island
in
the
bay
,
for
age
henceforth
to
be
aground
certain
yard
outside
her
;
these
be
render
bootless
question
by
the
darkness
of
that
night
and
the
darkness
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
here
she
go
down
.
   
<EOS>
even
as
I
stand
on
the
beach
with
the
word
"
here
she
go
down
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
my
ear
,
a
diver
in
his
grotesque
dress
,
dip
heavily
over
the
side
of
the
boat
alongside
the
Lighter
,
and
drop
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
on
the
shore
by
the
water
's
edge
,
be
a
rough
tent
,
make
of
fragment
of
wreck
,
where
other
diver
and
workman
shelter
themselves
,
and
where
they
have
keep
Christmas
-
day
with
rum
and
roast
beef
,
to
the
destruction
of
their
frail
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
Cast
up
among
the
stone
and
boulder
of
the
beach
,
be
great
spar
of
the
lost
vessel
,
and
masse
of
iron
twist
by
the
fury
of
the
sea
into
the
strange
form
.
 
<EOS>
the
timber
be
already
bleach
and
iron
rust
,
and
even
these
object
do
no
violence
to
the
prevail
air
the
whole
scene
wear
,
of
have
be
exactly
the
same
for
year
and
year
.
   
<EOS>
yet
,
only
two
short
month
have
go
,
since
a
man
,
live
on
the
near
hill
-
top
overlook
the
sea
,
be
blow
out
of
bed
at
about
daybreak
by
the
wind
that
have
begin
to
strip
his
roof
off
,
and
get
upon
a
ladder
with
his
near
neighbour
to
construct
some
temporary
device
for
keep
his
house
over
his
head
,
see
from
the
ladder
's
elevation
as
he
look
down
by
chance
towards
the
shore
,
some
dark
troubled
object
close
in
with
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
and
the
other
,
descend
to
the
beach
,
and
find
the
sea
mercilessly
beat
over
a
great
broken
ship
,
have
clamber
up
the
stony
way
,
like
staircase
without
stair
,
on
which
the
wild
village
hang
in
little
cluster
,
as
fruit
hang
on
bough
,
and
have
give
the
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
over
the
hill
-
slope
,
and
past
the
waterfall
,
and
down
the
gully
where
the
land
drain
off
into
the
ocean
,
the
scatter
quarryman
and
fisherman
inhabit
that
part
of
Wales
have
come
run
to
the
dismal
sight
---
their
clergyman
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
they
stand
in
the
leaden
morning
,
stricken
with
pity
,
lean
hard
against
the
wind
,
their
breath
and
vision
often
fail
as
the
sleet
and
spray
rush
at
them
from
the
ever
form
and
dissolve
mountain
of
sea
,
and
as
the
wool
which
be
a
part
of
the
vessel
's
cargo
blow
in
with
the
salt
foam
and
remain
upon
the
land
when
the
foam
melt
,
they
see
the
ship
's
life
-
boat
put
off
from
one
of
the
heap
of
wreck
;
and
first
,
there
be
three
man
in
her
,
and
in
a
moment
she
capsize
,
and
there
be
but
two
;
and
again
,
she
be
strike
by
a
vast
mass
of
water
,
and
there
be
but
one
;
and
again
,
she
be
throw
bottom
upward
,
and
that
one
,
with
his
arm
strike
through
the
broken
plank
and
wave
as
if
for
the
help
that
could
never
reach
him
,
go
down
into
the
deep
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
clergyman
himself
from
whom
I
hear
this
,
while
I
stand
on
the
shore
,
look
in
his
kind
wholesome
face
as
it
turn
to
the
spot
where
the
boat
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
diver
be
down
then
,
and
busy
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
"
lift
"
to
-
day
the
gold
find
yesterday
---
some
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pound
'
worth
of
gold
,
three
hundred
thousand
pound
'
worth
,
in
round
number
,
be
at
that
time
recover
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
bulk
of
the
remainder
be
surely
and
steadily
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
some
loss
of
sovereign
there
would
be
,
of
course
;
indeed
,
at
first
sovereign
have
drift
in
with
the
sand
,
and
be
scatter
far
and
wide
over
the
beach
,
like
sea
-
shell
;
but
most
other
golden
treasure
would
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
bring
up
,
it
go
aboard
the
Tug
-
steamer
,
where
good
account
be
take
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
tremendous
have
the
force
of
the
sea
be
when
it
break
the
ship
,
that
it
have
beat
one
great
ingot
of
gold
,
deep
into
a
strong
and
heavy
piece
of
her
solid
iron
-
work
:
 
in
which
,
also
,
several
loose
sovereign
that
the
ingot
have
sweep
in
before
it
,
have
be
find
,
as
firmly
embed
as
though
the
iron
have
be
liquid
when
they
be
force
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
remark
of
such
body
<EOS>
come
ashore
,
too
,
as
have
be
see
by
scientific
man
,
that
they
have
be
stun
to
death
,
and
not
suffocate
.
 
<EOS>
Observation
,
both
of
the
internal
change
that
have
be
work
in
them
,
and
of
their
external
expression
,
show
death
to
have
be
thus
merciful
and
easy
.
 
<EOS>
the
report
be
bring
,
while
I
be
hold
such
discourse
on
the
beach
,
that
no
more
body
have
come
ashore
since
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
begin
to
be
very
doubtful
whether
many
more
would
be
throw
up
,
until
the
north
-
east
wind
of
the
early
spring
set
in
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
a
great
number
of
the
passenger
,
and
particularly
the
second
-
class
woman
-
passenger
,
be
know
to
have
be
in
the
middle
of
the
ship
when
she
part
,
and
thus
the
collapse
wreck
would
have
fall
upon
them
after
yawn
open
,
and
would
keep
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
a
diver
make
know
,
even
then
,
that
he
have
come
upon
the
body
of
a
man
,
and
have
seek
to
release
it
from
a
great
superincumbent
weight
;
but
that
,
find
he
could
not
do
so
without
mutilate
the
remain
,
he
have
leave
it
where
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
kind
and
<EOS>
wholesome
face
<EOS>
I
have
make
mention
of
as
be
then
beside
me
,
that
I
have
purpose
to
myself
to
see
,
when
I
leave
home
for
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
that
clergyman
,
as
have
bury
many
score
of
the
shipwrecked
people
;
of
his
have
open
his
house
and
heart
to
their
agonised
friend
;
of
his
have
use
a
most
sweet
and
patient
diligence
for
week
and
week
,
in
the
performance
of
the
forlorn
office
that
Man
can
render
to
his
kind
;
of
his
have
most
tenderly
and
thoroughly
devote
himself
to
the
dead
,
and
to
those
who
be
sorrow
for
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
say
to
myself
,
"
<EOS>
in
the
Christmas
season
of
the
year
,
I
should
like
to
see
that
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
swing
the
gate
of
his
little
garden
in
come
out
to
meet
me
,
not
half
an
hour
ago
.
   
<EOS>
so
cheerful
of
spirit
and
guiltless
of
affectation
,
as
true
practical
Christianity
ever
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
read
more
of
the
New
Testament
in
the
fresh
frank
face
go
up
the
village
beside
me
,
in
five
minute
,
than
I
have
read
in
anathematise
discourse
(
albeit
put
to
press
with
enormous
flourishing
of
trumpet
)
,
in
all
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
more
of
the
Sacred
Book
in
the
cordial
voice
that
have
nothing
to
say
about
its
owner
,
than
in
all
the
would
-
be
celestial
pair
of
bellow
that
have
ever
blow
conceit
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
We
climb
towards
the
little
church
,
at
a
cheery
pace
,
among
the
loose
stone
,
the
deep
mud
,
the
wet
coarse
grass
,
the
outlying
water
,
and
other
obstruction
from
which
frost
and
snow
have
lately
thaw
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
mistake
<EOS>
(
my
friend
be
glad
to
tell
me
,
on
the
way
)
to
suppose
that
the
peasantry
have
show
any
superstitious
avoidance
of
the
drown
;
on
the
whole
,
they
have
do
very
well
,
and
have
assist
readily
.
 
<EOS>
ten
shilling
have
be
pay
for
the
bringing
of
each
body
up
to
the
church
,
but
the
way
be
steep
,
and
a
horse
and
cart
(
in
which
it
be
wrap
in
a
sheet
)
be
necessary
,
and
three
or
four
man
,
and
,
<EOS>
all
thing
consider
,
it
be
not
a
great
price
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
be
none
the
rich
for
the
wreck
,
for
it

It

<EOS>
the

his

two
sister

in

come
in
among
the

often
.
 
<EOS>
It
grow
to
be
the
business
of
their
life
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
any
new
arrival
of
a
bereave
woman
would
stimulate
their
pity
to
compare
the
description

with
the
dread
reality

<EOS>
sometimes
,
they
would
go
back
able
to

"
I

find

"
or
,
"
I
think
she
lie
there

"
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
the
mourner
,
unable

the
sight

would

conduct

"
this

and
drop
insensible

<EOS>
He
soon
observe
that
in
some
case
of
woman
,
the
identification
of
person
,
though
complete
,
be
quite
at
variance
with
the
mark
upon
the
linen
;
this
lead
him
to
notice
that
even
the
mark
upon
the
linen
be
sometimes
inconsistent
with
one
another
;
and
thus
he
come
to
understand
that
they
have
dress
in
great
haste
and
agitation
,
and
that
their
clothe
have
become
mixed
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
identification
of
man
by
their
dress
,
be
render
extremely
difficult
,
in
consequence
of
a
large
proportion
of
them
be
dress
alike
---
in
clothe
of

kind

that
be
to

supply
by

by

many

,
when

these
have

so
that
the

<EOS>
in

he

there

one

so
much

that
the

uneasy

with

<EOS>
the

be
<EOS>

a
step
from

<EOS>
the
cheerful
earnestness
of
this
good
christian
minister
be
as
consolatory
,
as
the
circumstance
out

which
it
shine
be
sad

<EOS>
I
never
have
see
anything
more
delightfully
genuine
than
the
calm
dismissal
by
himself
and
his
household
of
all
they
have
undergo
,
as
a
simple
duty
that
be
quietly
do

end

<EOS>
in
speak
of
it
,
they
speak
of
it
with
great
compassion
for
the
bereave
;
but
lay
no
stress
upon
their
own
hard
share
in
those
weary
week

except
as
it
have
attach
many
people
to
them

elicit
many
touching
expression

<EOS>
this

brother

himself
the

He

down

<EOS>
in
the
absence

assertion

it
be
only
through
my
now

then
delicately
put
a
question
as
the
occasion
arise
,
that
I
become
informed
of
these
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
I
have
remark
again
and
again
,
in
the
church
,
on
the
awful
nature
of
the
scene
of
death
<EOS>
he
have
be
require
so
closely
to
familiarise
himself
with
for
the
soothing
of
the
living
,
that
he
have
casually
say
,
without
the
least
abatement
of
his
cheerfulness
,
"
indeed
,
it
have
render
him
unable
for
a
time
to
eat
or
drink
more
than
a
little
coffee
now
and
then
,
and
a
piece
of
bread
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
this
noble
modesty
,
in
this
beautiful
simplicity
,
in
this
serene
avoidance
of
the
least
attempt
to
"
improve
"
an
occasion
which
may
be
suppose
to
have
sink
of
its
own
weight
into
my
heart
,
I
seem
to
have
happily
come
,
in
a
few
step
,
from
the
churchyard
with
its
open
grave
,
which
be
the
type
of
death
,
to
the
christian
dwelling
side
by
side
with
it
,
which
be
the
type
of
Resurrection
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
think
of
the
former
,
without
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
will
always
rest
side
by
side
in
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
lose
any
one
dear
to
me
in
this
unfortunate
ship
,
if
I
have
make
a
voyage
from
Australia
to
look
at
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
I
should
go
away
,
thankful
to
GOD
that
that
house
be
so
close
to
it
,
and
that
its
shadow
by
day
and
its
domestic
light
by
night
fall
upon
the
earth
in
which
its
Master
have
so
tenderly
lay
my
dear
one
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
the

naturally

to
the

send
down

I

the
morning
paper
,
that
there
be
no
classification
at
the
Wapping
workhouse
for
woman
,
and
that
it
be
a
disgrace
and
a
shame
,
and
diver
other
hard
name
,
and
because
I
wish
to
see
how
the
fact
really
stand
.
<EOS>
for
,
that
eastern
police
magistrate
be
not
always
the
wise
man
of
the
East
,
may
be
infer
from
their
course
of
procedure
respect
the
fancy
-
dress
and
pantomime
-
posture
at
St
George
be
in
that
quarter
:
 
which
be
usually
,
to
discuss
the
matter
at
issue
,
in
a
state
of
mind
betoken
the
weak
perplexity
,
with
all
party
concern
and
unconcerned
,
and
,
for
a
final
expedient
,
to
consult
the
complainant
as
to
what
he
think
ought
to
be
do
with
the
defendant
,
and
take
the
defendant
's
opinion
as
to
what
he
would
recommend
to
be
do
with
himself
.
   
<EOS>
long
before
I
reach
wapping
,
I
give
myself
up
as
have
lose
my
way
,
and
,
abandon
myself
to
the
narrow
street
in
a
turkish
frame
of
mind
,
rely
on
predestination
to
bring
me
somehow
or
other
to
the
place
I
want
if
I
be
ever
to
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
cease
for
an
hour
or
so
to
take
any
trouble
about
the
matter
,
I
find
myself
on
a
swing
-
bridge
look
down
at
some
dark
lock
in
some
dirty
water
.
 
<EOS>
over
against
me
,
stand
a
creature
remotely
in
the
likeness
of
a
young
man
,
with
a
puffed
sallow
face
,
and
a
figure
all
dirty
and
shiny
and
slimy
,
who
may
have
be
the
young
son
of
his
filthy
old
father
,
Thames
,
or
the
drowned
man
about
whom
there
be
a
placard
on
the
granite
post
like
a
large
thimble
,
that
stand
between
us
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
this
apparition
what
it
call
the
place
?
 
<EOS>
unto
which
,
it
reply
,
with
a
ghastly
grin
and
a
sound
like
gurgle
water
in
its
throat
:
   
"
Mr
Baker
's
trap
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
it
be
a
point
of
great
sensitiveness
with
me
on
such
occasion
to
be
equal
to
the
intellectual
pressure
of
the
conversation
,
I
deeply
consider
the
meaning
of
this
speech
,
while
I
eye
the
apparition
---
then
engage
in
hug
and
suck
a
horizontal
iron
bar
at
the
top
of
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
inspiration
suggest
to
me
that
Mr
Baker
be
the
act
coroner
of
that
neighbourhood
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
common
place
for
suicide
,
"
say
I
,
look
down
at
the
lock
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sue

"
return
the
ghost
,
with
a
stare

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
and
Poll

<EOS>
likewise

Ketches

down

they

and
at
about
that
hour

I
suppose

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>

On'y

"
 
<EOS>
here
the
apparition
rest
his
profile
on
the
bar
,
and
gurgle
in
a
sarcastic
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
must
be

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
no
Bobby
nor
gen'ral

fur
to

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
accord
to
my
interpretation
of
these
word
,
I
be
myself
a
General
Cove
,
or
member
of
the
miscellaneous
public
.
 
<EOS>
in
which
modest
character
I
remark
:
   
<EOS>
"
They
be
often
take
out
,
be
they
,
and
restore
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dunno
about
restore
,
"
say
the
apparition
,
who
,
for
some
occult
reason
,
very
much
object
to
that
word
;
<EOS>
"
they
be
carry
into
the
werkis
and
put
into
a
"
ot
bath
,
and
bring
round
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
dunno
about
restore
,
"
say
the
apparition
;
"
blow
that
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
vanish
.
   
<EOS>
as
it
have
show
a
desire
to
become
offensive
,
I
be
not
sorry
to
find
myself
alone
,
especially
as
the
"
werkiss
"
it
have
indicate
with
a
twist
of
its
matted
head
,
be
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
leave
Mr
Baker
's
terrible
trap
(
bait
with
a
scum
that
be
like
the
soapy
rinsing
of
sooty
chimneys
)
,
and
make
bold
to
ring
at
the
workhouse
gate
,
where
I
be
wholly
unexpected
and
quite
unknown
.
   
<EOS>
a
very
bright
and
nimble
little
matron
,
with
a
bunch
of
key
in
her
hand
,
respond
to
my
request
to
see
the
House
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
the
police
magistrate
be
quite
right
in
his
fact
,
when
I
notice
her
quick
,
active
little
figure
and
her
intelligent
eye
.
   
<EOS>
the
Traveller
(
the
matron
intimate
)
should
see
the
bad
first
.
<EOS>
He
be
welcome
to
see
everything
.
 
<EOS>
such
as
it
be
,
there
it
all
be
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
preparation
for
our
entering
"
the
Foul
ward
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
in
an
old
building
squeeze
away
in
a
corner
of
a
paved
yard
,
quite
detach
from
the
more
modern
and
spacious
main
body
of
the
workhouse
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
in
a
building
most
monstrously
behind
the
time
---
a
mere
series
of
garret
or
loft
,
with
every
inconvenient
and
objectionable
circumstance
in
their
construction
,
and
only
accessible
by
steep
and
narrow
staircase
,
infamously
ill
-
adapt
for
the
passage
up
-
stair
of
the
sick
or
down
-
stair
of
the
dead
.
   
<EOS>
a
-
bed
in
these
miserable
room
,
here
on
bedstead
,
there
(
for
a
change
,
as
I
understand
it
)
on
the
floor
,
be
woman
in
every
stage
of
distress
and
disease
.
 
<EOS>
none
but
those
who
have
attentively
observe
such
scene
,
can
conceive
the
extraordinary
variety
of
expression
still
latent
under
the
general
monotony
and
uniformity
of
colour
,
attitude
,
and
condition
.
 
<EOS>
the
form
a
little
coiled
up
and
turn
away
,
as
though
it
have
turn
its
back
on
this
world
for
ever
;
the
uninterested
face
at
once
lead
-
coloured
and
yellow
,
look
passively
upward
from
the
pillow
;
the
haggard
mouth
a
little
drop
,
the
hand
outside
the
coverlet
,
so
dull
and
indifferent
,
so
light
,
and
yet
so
heavy
;
these
be
on
every
pallet
;
but
when
I
stop
beside
a
bed
,
and
say
ever
so
slight
a
word
to
the
figure
lie
there
,
the
ghost
of
the
old
character
come
into
the
face
,
and
make
the
Foul
ward
as
various
as
the
fair
world
.
<EOS>
no
one
appear
to
care
to
live
,
but
no
one
complain
;
all
who
could
speak
,
<EOS>
say
that
as
much
be
do
for
them
as
could
be
do
there
,
that
the
attendance
be
kind
and
patient
,
that
their
suffering
be
very
heavy
,
but
they
have
nothing
to
ask
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
wretched
room
be
as
clean
and
sweet
as
it
be
possible
for
such
room
to
be
;
they
would
become
a
pest
-
house
in
a
single
week
,
if
they
be
ill
-
keep
.
   
<EOS>
I
accompany
the
brisk
matron
up
another
barbarous
staircase
,
into
a
well
kind
of
loft
devote
to
the
idiotic
and
imbecile
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
at
least
light
in
it
,
whereas
the
window
in
the
former
ward
have
be
like
side
of
school
-
boy
'
bird
-
cage
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strong
grating
over
the
fire
here
,
and
,
hold
a
kind
of
state
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
,
separate
by
the
breadth
of
this
grating
,
be
two
old
lady
in
a
condition
of
feeble
dignity
,
which
be
surely
the
very
last
and
low
reduction
of
self
-
complacency
to
be
find
in
this
wonderful
humanity
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
evidently
jealous
of
each
other
,
and
pass
their
whole
time
(
as
some
people
do
,
whose
fire
be
not
grate
)
in
mentally
disparage
each
other
,
and
contemptuously
watch
their
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
parody
on
provincial
gentlewoman
be
extremely
talkative
,
and
express
a
strong
desire
to
attend
the
service
on
Sundays
,
from
which
she
represent
herself
to
have
derive
the
great
interest
and
consolation
when
allow
that
privilege
.
 
<EOS>
She
gossip
so
well
,
and
look
altogether
so
cheery
and
harmless
,
that
I
begin
to
think
this
a
case
for
the
eastern
magistrate
,
until
I
find
that
on
the
last
occasion
of
her
attend
chapel
she
have
secrete
a
small
stick
,
and
have
cause
some
confusion
in
the
response
by
suddenly
produce
it
and
belabour
the
congregation
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
these
two
old
lady
,
separate
by
the
breadth
of
the
grating
---
otherwise
they
would
fly
at
one
another
's
cap
---
sit
all
day
long
,
suspect
one
another
,
and
contemplate
a
world
of
fit
.
 
<EOS>
for
everybody
else
in
the
room
have
fit
,
except
the
ward
-
woman
;
an
elderly
,
able
-
bodied
pauperess
,
with
a
large
upper
lip
,
and
an
air
of
repress
and
save
her
strength
,
as
she
stand
with
her
hand
fold
before
her
,
and
her
eye
slowly
roll
,
bide
her
time
for
catch
or
hold
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
this
civil
personage
(
in
whom
I
regret
to
identify
a
reduce
member
of
my
honourable
friend
Mrs
Gamp
's
family
)
say
,
"
They

another

<EOS>
this

'em
dreadful
bad

"
   
<EOS>
She
turn
up
this
young
woman
's
face
with
her
hand
as
she
say
it
.
<EOS>
this
young
woman
be
seat
on
the
floor
,
ponder
in
the
foreground
of
the
afflict
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
repellent
either
in
her
face
or
head
.
 
<EOS>
many
,
apparently
bad
,
<EOS>
variety
of
epilepsy
and
hysteria
be
about
her
,
but
she
be
say
to
be
the
bad
here
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
speak
to
her
a
little
,
she
still
sit
with
her
face
turn
up
,
ponder
,
and
a
gleam
of
the
mid
-
day
sun
shine
in
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
whether
this
young
woman
,
and
the
rest
of
these
so
sorely
trouble
,
as
they
sit
or
lie
ponder
in
their
confused
dull
way
,
ever
get
mental
glimpse
among
the
mote
in
the
sunlight
,
of
healthy
people
and
healthy
thing
?
 
<EOS>
whether
this
young
woman
,
brood
like
this
in
the
summer
season
,
ever
think
that
somewhere
there
be
tree
and
flower
,
even
mountain
and
the
great
sea
?
<EOS>
whether
,
not
to
go
so
far
,
this
young
woman
ever
have
any
dim
revelation
of
that
young
woman
---
that
young
woman
who
be
not
here
and
never
will
come
here
;
who
be
courted
,
and
caress
,
and
love
,
and
have
a
husband
,
and
bear
child
,
and
live
in
a
home
,
and
who
never
know
what
it
be
to
have
this
lashing
and
tearing
come
upon
her
?
 
<EOS>
and
whether
this
young
woman
,
God
help
her
,
give
herself
up
then
and
drop
like
a
coach
-
horse
from
the
moon
?
   
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
whether
the
voice
of
infant
child
,
penetrate
into
so
hopeless
a
place
,
make
a
sound
that
be
pleasant
or
painful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
be
remind
that
the
weary
world
be
not
all
aweary
,
and
be
ever
renew
itself
;
but
,
this
young
woman
be
a
child
not
long
ago
,
and
a
child
not
long
hence
may
be
such
as
she
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
the
active
step
and
eye
of
the
vigilant
matron
conduct
me
past
the
two
provincial
gentlewoman
(
whose
dignity
be
ruffle
by
the
child
)
,
and
into
the
adjacent
nursery
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
many
baby
here
,
and
more
than
one
handsome
young
mother
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
ugly
young
mother
also
,
and
sullen
young
mother
,
and
callous
young
mother
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
baby
have
not
appropriate
to
themselves
any
bad
expression
yet

and
may
have
be

for
anything
that
appear

contrary

Princes

<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
of
give
a
poetical
commission
to
the
baker

make
a
cake
with
all
despatch

toss
it
into
the
oven

young

myself

feel
much
the
well
for

<EOS>
without
that
refreshment

I
doubt
if
I
should
have
be
in
a
condition
for
"
the
Refractories

"
towards
whom
my
quick
little
matron
---
for
whose
adaptation
to
her
office
<EOS>
I
have
by
this

conceive
a
genuine
respect

draw
me
next

marshal
me
the
way

I
be
go

<EOS>
the
Refractories
be
pick
oakum

in
a
small

give
on

<EOS>
They
sit
in
line

with
their

before
them

a

and
their

<EOS>
the
old
refractory
be
,
say
twenty

young
Refractory
,
say
sixteen

<EOS>
I
have
never
yet
ascertain
in
the
course
of
my
uncommercial
travel
,
why
a
refractory
habit
should
affect
the
tonsil
and
uvula
;
but
,
I
have
always
observe
that
refractory
of
both
sex
and
every
grade
,
between
a
Ragged
School
and
the
Old
Bailey
,
have
one
voice

"
five

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
hain't

say
the
Chief

keep
time
to
herself

<EOS>
"
More

Oakum

Skirmishers

<EOS>
the
Uncommercial
take
the
liberty
of
hint
that
he
hardly
think
it
probable
that
any
lady

gentleman
in
want
of
a
likely
young
domestic
of
retire
manner

would
be
tempt
into

<EOS>
"
truly

"
   
<EOS>
Oakum
Head
then
rise
,
and
announce
as
an
entirely
new
idea
<EOS>
,
the
mention
of
which
profound
novelty
may
be
naturally
expect
to
startle
her
unprepared
hearer
,
that
she
would
be
very
thankful
to
be
get
into
a
place
,
or
get
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
if
she
have
then
say
,
"
Chorus
,
lady
!
<EOS>
"
all
the
skirmisher
strike
up
to
the
same
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
them
,
thereupon
,
and
begin
a
long
walk
among
the
woman
who
be
simply
old
and
infirm
;
but
whenever
,
in
the
course
of
this
same
walk
,
I
look
out
of
any
high
window
that
command
the
yard
<EOS>
,
I
see
Oakum
Head
and
all
the
other
Refractories
look
out
at
their
low
window
for
me
,
and
never
fail
to
catch
me
,
the
moment
I
show
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
I
have
cease
to
believe
in
such
fable
of
a
golden
time
as
youth
,
the
prime
of
life
,
or
a
hale
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
,
all
the
light
of
womankind
seem
to
have
be
blow
out
,
and
nothing
in
that
way
to
be
leave
this
vault
to
brag
of
,
but
the
flicker
and
expire
snuff
.
   
<EOS>
and
what
be
very
curious
,
be
,
that
these
dim
old
woman
have
one
company
notion
which
be
the
fashion
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
every
old
woman
who
become
aware
of
a
visitor
and
be
not
in
bed
hobble
over
a
form
into
her
accustomed
seat
,
and
become
one
of
a
line
of
dim
old
woman
confront
another
line
of
dim
old
woman
across
a
narrow
table
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
obligation
whatever
upon
them
to
range
themselves
in
this
way
;
it
be
their
manner
of
"
receive
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
a
rule
,
they
make
no
attempt
to
talk
to
one
another
,
or
to
look
at
the
visitor
,
or
to
look
at
anything
,
but
sit
silently
work
their
mouth
,
like
a
sort
of
poor
old
Cows
.
 
<EOS>
in
some
of
these
ward
,
it
be
good
to
see
a
few
green
plant
;
in
other
,
an
isolate
Refractory
act
as
nurse
,
who
do
well
enough
in
that
capacity
,
when
separate
from
her
compeer
;
every
one
of
these
ward
,
day
room
,
night
room
,
or
<EOS>
both
combined
,
be
scrupulously
clean
and
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
as
many
such
place
as
most
traveller
in
my
line
,
and
I
never
see
one
such
,
better
keep
.
   
<EOS>
among
the
bedridden
there
be
great
patience
,
great
reliance
on
the
book
under
the
pillow
,
great
faith
in
GOD
.
 
<EOS>
all
care
for
sympathy
,
but
none
much
care
to
be
encourage
with
hope
of
recovery
;
on
the
whole
,
I
should
say
,
it
be
consider
rather
a
distinction
to
have
a
complication
of
disorder
,
and
to
be
in
a
bad
way
than
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
from
some
of
the
window
,
the
river
could
be
see
with
all
its
life
and
movement
;
the
day
be
bright
,
but
I
come
upon
no
one
who
be
look
out
.
   
<EOS>
in
one
large
ward
,
sit
by
the
fire
in
arm
-
chair
of
distinction
,
like
the
President
and
Vice
of
the
good
company
,
be
two
old
woman
,
upwards
of
ninety
year
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
of
the
two
,
just
turn
ninety
,
be
deaf
,
but
not
very
,
and
could
easily
be
make
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
early
time
she
have
nurse
a
child
,
who
be
now
another
old
woman
,
more
infirm
than
herself
,
inhabit
the
very
same
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
She
perfectly
understand
this
when
the
matron
tell
it
,
and
,
with
sundry
nod
and
motion
of
her
forefinger
,
point
out
the
woman
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
the
elder
of
this
pair
,
ninety
-
three
,
seat
before
an
illustrate
newspaper
(
but
not
read
it
)
,
be
a
bright
-
eyed
old
soul
,
really
not
deaf
,
wonderfully
preserve
,
and
amazingly
conversational
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
long
lose
her
husband
,
and
have
be
in
that
place
little
more
than
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
at
Boston
,
in
the
State
of
Massachusetts
,
this
poor
creature
would
have
be
individually
address
,
would
have
be
tend
in
her
own
room
,
and
would
have
have
her
life
gently
assimilate
to
a
comfortable
life
out
of
door
.
 
<EOS>
Would
that
be
much
to
do
in
England
for
a
woman
who
have
keep
herself
out
of
a
workhouse
more
than
ninety
rough
long
year
?
 
<EOS>
when
Britain
first
,
at
Heaven
's
command
,
arise
,
with
a
great
deal
of
allegorical
confusion
,
from
out
the
azure
main
,
do
her
guardian
angel
positively
forbid
it
in
the
Charter
which
have
be
so
much
besung
?
   
<EOS>
the
object
of
my
journey
be
accomplish
when
the
nimble
matron
have
no
more
to
show
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
shake
hand
with
her
at
the
gate
,
I
tell
her
that
I
think
justice
have
not
use
her
very
well
,
and
that
the
wise
man
of
the
East
be
not
infallible
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
I
reason
with
myself
,
as
I
make
my
journey
home
again
,
concern
those
foul
ward
.
 
<EOS>
They
ought
not
to
exist
;
no
person
of
common
decency
and
humanity
can
see
them
and
doubt
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
this
Union
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
the
necessary
alteration
would
cost
several
thousand
of
pound
;
it
have
already
to
support
three
workhouse
;
its
inhabitant
work
hard
for
their
bare
life
,
and
be
already
rate
for
the
relief
of
the
Poor
to
the
utmost
extent
of
reasonable
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
one
poor
parish
in
this
very
Union
be
rate
to
the
amount
of
five
and
SIXPENCE
in
the
pound
,
at
the
very
same
time
when
the
rich
parish
of
Saint
George
's
,
Hanover
-
square
,
be
rate
at
about
sevenpence
in
the
pound
,
Paddington
at
about
FOURPENCE
,
Saint
James
's
,
Westminster
,
at
about
TENPENCE
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
through
the
equalisation
of
Poor
Rates
that
what
be
leave
undone
in
this
wise
,
can
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
much
more
be
leave
undone
,
or
be
ill
-
do
,
than
I
have
space
to
suggest
in
these
note
of
a
single
uncommercial
journey
;
but
,
the
wise
man
of
the
East
,
before
they
can
reasonably
hold
forth
about
it
,
must
look
to
the
North
and
South
and
West
;
let
them
also
,
any
morning
before
take
the
seat
of
Solomon
,
look
into
the
shop
and
dwelling
all
around
the
Temple
,
and
first
ask
themselves
"
how
much
more
can
these
poor
people
---
many
of
whom
keep
themselves
with
difficulty
enough
out
of
the
workhouse
---
bear
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
yet
other
matter
for
reflection
as
I
journey
home
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
,
before
I
altogether
depart
from
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr
Baker
's
trap
,
I
have
knock
at
the
gate
of
the
workhouse
of
St
George's
-
in
-
the
-
East
,
and
have
find
it
to
be
an
establishment
highly
creditable
to
those
part
,
and
thoroughly
well
administer
by
a
most
intelligent
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
remark
in
it
,
an
instance
of
the
collateral
harm
that
obstinate
vanity
and
folly
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
Hall
where
those
old
pauper
,
male
and
female
,
whom
I
have
just
see
,
meet
for
the
Church
service
,
be
it
?
"
---
"
yes
.
"
---
<EOS>
"
do
they
sing
the
Psalms
to
any
instrument
?
"
---
"
They
would
like
to
,
very
much
;
they
would
have
an
extraordinary
interest
in
do
so
.
"
---
<EOS>
"
and
could
none
be
get
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
well
,
a
piano
could
even
have
be
get
for
nothing
,
but
these
unfortunate
dissension
---
"
 
ah
!
<EOS>
better
,
far
well
,
my
christian
friend
in
the
beautiful
garment
,
to
have
let
the
singing
boy
alone
,
and
leave
the
multitude
to
sing
for
themselves
!
 
<EOS>
You
should
know
better
than
I
,
but
I
think
I
have
read
that
they
do
so
,
once
upon
a
time
,
and
that
"
when
they
have
sing
an
hymn
,
"
some
one
(
not
in
a
beautiful
garment
)
go
up
into
the
Mount
of
Olives
.
   
<EOS>
It
make
my
heart
ache
to
think
of
this
miserable
trifling
,
in
the
street
of
a
city
where
every
stone
seem
to
call
to
me
,
as
I
walk
along
,
"
turn
this
way
,
man
,
and
see
what
wait
to
be
do
!
"
<EOS>
so
I
decoy
myself
into
another
train
of
thought
to
ease
my
heart
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
do
it
,
for
I
be
so
full
of
pauper
,
that
it
be
,
after
all
,
only
a
change
to
a
single
pauper
,
who
take
possession
of
my
remembrance
instead
of
a
thousand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

sir

he
have
say

in

on

I

I

My

have
be
so
offend

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
to

towards
this
end

very
sensible
precaution

ingeniously
combine
the

hospital

<EOS>
Asphalt

substitute

<EOS>
these
various
contrivance
be
as
well
consider
in

place
in
question
as
if
it
be
a
Fever
Hospital

the
result
be
,
that
it
be
sweet

healthful

<EOS>
It
have
be
construct
from
the
ground

the
roof

with
a
careful
reference
to
sight

sound

every
corner

the
result
be

that
its

beautiful

that
the
appearance

the
audience
,
as
see
from
the
proscenium

with
every

command
the

that
a
hand
can
scarcely
move
in
the
great
assemblage
without
the
movement
be
see
from
thence

be
highly
remarkable
in
its
union
of
vastness
with
compactness
.
<EOS>
the
stage
itself
,
and
all
its
appurtenance
of
machinery
,
cellarage
,
height
and
breadth
,
be
on
a
scale
more
like
the
Scala
at
Milan

or
the
San

at
Naples
,
or
the
Grand
Opera

than
any

St

<EOS>
the
Forty

ride
his

captain
bring

on
a
train

real

nobody

<EOS>
this
really
extraordinary
place
be
the
achievement
of
one
man
's
enterprise
,
and
be
erect
on
the
ruin
of
an
inconvenient
old
building
in
less
than
five
month
,
at
a
round
cost
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
to
dismiss
this
part
of
my
subject
,
and
still
to
render
to
the
proprietor
the
credit
that
be
strictly
his
due
,
I
must
add
that
his
sense
of
the
responsibility
upon
him
to
make
the
good
of
his
audience
,
and
to
do
his
good
for
them
,
be
a
highly
agreeable
sign
of
these
time
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
spectator
at
this
theatre
,
for
a
reason
I
will
presently
show
,
be
the
object
of
my
journey
,
I
enter
on
the
play
of
the
night
as
one
of
the
two
thousand
and
odd
hundred
,
by
look
about
me
at
my
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
a
motley
assemblage
of
people
,
and
we
have
a
good
many
boy
and
young
man
among
us
;
we
have
also
many
girl
and
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
to
represent
,
however
,
that
we
do
not
include
a
very
great
number
,
and
a
very
fair
proportion
of
family
group
,
would
be
to
make
a
gross
mis
-
statement
.
 
<EOS>
such
group
be
to
be
see
in
all
part
of
the
house
;
in
the
box
and
stall
particularly
,
they
be
compose
of
person
of
very
decent
appearance
,
who
have
many
child
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
among
our
dress
there
be
most
kind
of
shabby
and
greasy
wear
,
and
much
fustian
and
corduroy
that
be
neither
sound
nor
fragrant
.
 
<EOS>
the
cap
of
our
young
man
be
mostly
of
a
limp
character
,
and
we
who
wear
them
,
slouch
,
high
-
shouldered
,
into
our
place
with
our
hand
in
our
pocket
,
and
occasionally
twist
our
cravat
about
our
neck
like
eel
,
and
occasionally
tie
them
down
our
breast
like
link
of
sausage
,
and
occasionally
have
a
screw
in
our
hair
over
each
cheek
-
bone
with
a
slight
thief
-
flavour
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
besides
prowler
and
idler
,
we
be
mechanic
,
dock
-
labourer
,
costermonger
,
petty
tradesman
,
small
clerk
,
milliner
,
stay
-
maker
,

poor
worker
in
a
hundred
highway
and
byway
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
us
---
on
the
whole
,
the
majority
---
be
not
at
all
clean
,
and
not
at
all
choice
in
our
life
or
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
all
come
together
in
a
place
where
our
convenience
be
well
consult
,
and
where
we
be
well
look
after
,
to
enjoy
an
evening
's
entertainment
in
common
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
go
to
lose
any
part
of
what
we
have
pay
for
through
anybody
's
caprice
,
and
as
a
community
we
have
a
character
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
we
be
closely
attentive
,
and
keep
excellent
order
;
and
let
the
man
or
boy
who
do
otherwise
instantly
get
out
from
this
place
,
or
we
would
put
him
out
with
the
great
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
We
begin
at
half
-
past
six
with
a
pantomime
---
with
a
pantomime
so
long
,
that
before
it
be
over
I
feel
as
if
I
have
be
travel
for
six
week
---
go
to
India
,
say
,
by
the
Overland
Mail
.
 
<EOS>
the
Spirit
of
Liberty
be
the
principal
personage
in
the
Introduction
,
and
the
Four
Quarters
of
the
World
come
out
of
the
globe
,
glittering
,
and
discourse
with
the
Spirit
,
who
sing
charmingly
.
<EOS>
We
be
delighted
to
understand
that
there
be
no
liberty
anywhere
<EOS>
but
among
ourselves
,
<EOS>
and
we
highly
applaud
the
agreeable
fact
.
<EOS>
in
an
allegorical
way
,
which
do
as
well
as
any
other
way
,
we
and
the
Spirit
of
Liberty
get
into
a
kingdom
of
Needles
and
Pins
,
and
find
them
at
war
with
a
potentate
who
call
in
to
his
aid
their
old
arch
enemy
Rust
,
and
who
would
have
get
the
well
of
them
if
the
Spirit
of
Liberty
have
not
in
the
nick
of
time
transform
the
leader
into
Clown
,
Pantaloon
,
Harlequin
,
Columbine
,
Harlequina
,
and
a
whole
family
of
Sprites
,
consist
of
a
remarkably
stout
father
and
three
spineless
son
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
what
be
come
when
the
Spirit
of
Liberty
address
the
king
with
a
big
face
,
and
His
Majesty
back
to
the
side
-
scene
and
begin
untie
himself
behind
,
with
his
big
face
all
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
Our
excitement
at
that
crisis
be
great
,
and
our
delight
unbounde
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
era
in
our
existence
,
we
go
through
all
the
incident
of
a
pantomime
;
it
be
not
by
any
mean
<EOS>
a
savage
pantomime
,
in
the
way
of
burn
or
boil
people
,
or
throw
them
out
of
window
,
or
cut
them
up
;
be
often
very
droll
;
be
always
liberally
get
up
,
and
cleverly
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
the
people
who
keep
the
shop
,
and
who
represent
the
passenger
in
the
thoroughfare
,
and
so
forth
,
have
no
conventionality
in
them
,
but
be
unusually
like
the
real
thing
---
from
which
I
infer
that
you
may
take
that
audience
in
(
if
you
wish
to
)
concern
Knights
and
Ladies
,
Fairies
,
Angels
,
or
such
like
,
but
they
be
not
to
be
do
as
to
anything
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
,
also
,
that
when
two
young
man
,
dress
in
exact
imitation
of
the
eel
-
and
-
sausage
-
cravate
portion
of
the
audience
,
be
chase
by
policeman
,
and
,
find
themselves
in
danger
of
be
catch
,
drop
so
suddenly
as
to
oblige
the
policeman
to
tumble
over
them
<EOS>
,
there
be
great
rejoicing
among
the
cap
---
as
though
it
be
a
delicate
reference
to
something
they
have
hear
of
before
.
   
<EOS>
the
Pantomime
be
succeed
by
a
Melo
-
Drama
.
 
<EOS>
throughout
the
evening
I
be
pleased
to
observe
Virtue
quite
as
triumphant
as
she
usually
be
out
of
door
,
and
indeed
I
think
rather
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
agree
(
for
the
time
)
that
honesty
be
the
good
policy
,
and
we
be
as
hard
as
iron
upon
Vice
,
and
we
would
not
hear
of
Villainy
get
on
in
the
world
---
no
,
not
on
any
consideration
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
between
the
piece
,
we
almost
all
of
us
go
out
and
refresh
.
<EOS>
many
of
us
go
the
length
of
drink
beer
at
the
bar
of
the
neighbour
public
-
house
,
some
of
us
drink
spirit
,
crowd
of
us
have
sandwich
and
ginger
-
beer
at
the
refreshment
-
bar
establish
for
us
in
the
Theatre
.
 
<EOS>
the
sandwich
---
as
substantial
as
be
consistent
with
portability
,
and
as
cheap
as
possible
<EOS>
---
we
hail
as
one
of
our
great
institution
.
 
<EOS>
It
force
its
way
among
us
at
all
stage
of
the
entertainment
,
and
we
be
always
delighted
to
see
it
;
its
adaptability
to
the
varying
mood
of
our
nature
be
surprising
;
we
could
never
weep
so
comfortably
as
when
our
tear
fall
on
our
sandwich
;
we
could
never
laugh
so
heartily
as
when
we
choke
with
sandwich
;
Virtue
never
look
so
beautiful
or
Vice
<EOS>
so
deform
as
when
we
pause
,
sandwich
in
hand
,
to
consider
what
would
come
of
that
resolution
of
Wickedness
in
boot
,
to
sever
innocence
in

<EOS>
when
the
curtain
fall
for
the
night
,
we
still
fall
back
upon
sandwich
,
to
help
us
through
the
rain
and
mire
,
and
home
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
this
,
as
I
have
mention
,
be
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
Being
<EOS>
Saturday
night
,
I
have
accomplish
but
the
half
of
my
uncommercial
journey
;
for
,
its
object
be
to
compare
the
play
on
Saturday
evening
with
the
preaching
in
the
same
Theatre
on
Sunday
evening
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
,
at
the
same
hour
of
half
-
past
six
on
the
similarly
damp
and
muddy
Sunday
evening
,
I
return
to
this
Theatre
.
 
<EOS>
I
drive
up
to
the
entrance
(
fearful
of
be
late
,
or
I
should
have
come
on
foot
)
,
and
find
myself
in
a
large
crowd
of
people
who
,
I
be
happy
to
state
,
be
put
into
excellent
spirit
by
my
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
have
nothing
to
look
at
but
the
mud
and
the
close
door
,
they
look
at
me
,
and
highly
enjoy
the
comic
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
My
modesty
induce
me
to
draw
off
,
some
hundred
of
yard
,
into
a
dark
corner
,
they
at
once
forget
me
,
and
apply
themselves
to
their
former
occupation
of
look
at
the
mud
and
look
in
at
the
closed
door
:
 
which
,
be
of
grate
ironwork
,
allow
the
light
passage
within
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
chiefly
people
of
respectable
appearance
,
odd
and
impulsive
as
most
crowd
be
,
and
make
a
joke
of
be
there
as
most
crowd
do
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
dark
corner
I
may
have
sit
a
long
while
,
but
that
a
very
obliging
passer
-
by
inform
me
that
the
Theatre
be
already
full
,
and
that
the
people
whom
I
see
in
the
street
be
all
shut
out
for
want
of
room
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
lose
no
time
in
worm
myself
into
the
building
,
and
creep
to
a
place
in
a
Proscenium
box
that
have
be
keep
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
there
must
have
be
full
four
thousand
people
present
.
 
<EOS>
carefully
estimate
the
pit
alone
,
I
could
bring
it
out
as
hold
little
less
than
fourteen
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
every
part
of
the
house
be
well
fill
,
and
I
have
not
find
it
easy
to
make
my
way
along
the
back
of
the
box
to
where
I
sit
.
 
<EOS>
the
chandelier
in
the
ceiling
be
light
;
there
be
no
light
on
the
stage
;
the
orchestra
be
empty
.
<EOS>
the
green
curtain
be
down
,
and
,
pack
pretty
closely
on
chair
on
the
small
space
of
stage
before
it
,
be
some
thirty
gentleman
,
and
two
or
three
lady
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
centre
of
these
,
in
a
desk
or
pulpit
cover
with
red
baize
,
be
the
preside
minister
.
 
<EOS>
the
kind
of
rostrum
he
occupy
will
be
very
well
understand
,
if
I
liken
it
to
a
board
-
up
fireplace
turn
towards
the
audience
,
with
a
gentleman
in
a
black
surtout
stand
in
the
stove
and
lean
forward
over
the
mantelpiece
.
   
<EOS>
a
portion
of
scripture
be
be
read
when
I
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
follow
by
a
discourse
,
to
which
the
congregation
listen
with
most
exemplary
attention
and
uninterrupted
silence
and
decorum
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
attention
comprehend
both
the
auditory
and
the
speaker
,
and
shall
turn
to
both
in
this
recalling
of
the
scene
,
exactly
as
it
do
at
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
very
difficult
thing
,
"
I
think
,
when
the
discourse
begin
,
"
to
speak
appropriately
to
so
large
an
audience
,
and
to
speak
with
tact
.
 
<EOS>
without
it
,
well
not
to
speak
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
infinitely
better
,
to
read
the
New
Testament
well
,
and
to
let
that
speak
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
congregation
there
be
indubitably
one
pulse
;
but
I
doubt
if
any
power
short
of
genius
can
touch
it
as
one
,
and
make
it
answer
as
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
possibly
say
to
myself
as
the
discourse
proceed
,
that
the
minister
be
a
good
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
possibly
say
to
myself
that
he
express
an
understanding
of
the
general
mind
and
character
of
his
audience
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
supposititious
working
-
man
introduce
into
the
homily
,
to
make
supposititious
objection
to
our
christian
religion
and
be
reason
down
,
who
be
not
only
a
very
disagreeable
person
,
but
remarkably
unlike
life
---
very
much
more
unlike
it
than
anything
I
have
see
in
the
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
the
native
independence
of
character
this
artisan
be
suppose
to
possess
,
be
represent
by
a
suggestion
of
a
dialect
that
I
certainly
never
hear
in
my
uncommercial
travel
,
and
with
a
coarse
swing
of
voice
and
manner
anything
but
agreeable
to
his
feeling
,
I
should
conceive
,
consider
in
the
light
of
a
portrait
,
and
as
far
away
from
the
fact
as
a
Chinese
Tartar
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
model
pauper
introduce
in
like
manner
,
who
appear
to
me
to
be
the
most
intolerably
arrogant
pauper
ever
relieve
,
and
to
show
himself
in
absolute
want
and
dire
necessity
of
a
course
of
Stone
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
how
do
this
pauper
testify
to
his
have
receive
the
gospel
of
humility
?
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
meet
him
in
the
workhouse
,
and
say
(
which
I
myself
really
think
good
-
natured
of
him
)
,
"
ah
,
John
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
see
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
see
you
so
poor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
,
sir
!
"
reply
that
man
,
draw
himself
up
,
"
I
be
the
son
of
a
Prince
!
<EOS>
my
father
be
the
King
of
Kings
.
 
<EOS>
my
father
be
the
Lord
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
my
father
be
the
ruler
of
all
the
Princes
of
the
Earth
!
"
&
c.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
what
all
the
preacher
's
fellow
-
sinner
may
come
to
,
if
they
would
embrace
this
bless
book
---
which
I
must
say
it
do
some
violence
to
my
own
feeling
of
reverence
,
to
see
hold
out
at
arm
's
length
at
frequent
interval
and
soundingly
slap
,
like
a
slow
lot
at
a
sale
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
could
I
help
ask
myself
the
question
,
whether
the
mechanic
before
me
,
who
must
detect
the
preacher
as
be
wrong
about
the
visible
manner
of
himself
and
the
like
of
himself
,
and
about
such
a
noisy
lip
-
server
as
that
pauper
,
may
not
,
most
unhappily
for
the
usefulness
of
the
occasion
,
doubt
that
preacher
's
be
right
about
thing
not
visible
to
human
sense
?
   
<EOS>
again
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
necessary
or
advisable
to
address
such
an
audience
continually
as
"
fellow
-
sinner
'
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
enough
to
be
fellow
-
creature
,
bear
yesterday
,
suffer
and
strive
to
-
day
,
die
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
by
our
common
humanity
,
my
brother
and
sister
,
by
our
common
capacity
for
pain
and
pleasure
,
by
our
common
laughter
and
our
common
tear
,
by
our
common
aspiration
to
reach
something
well
than
ourselves
,
by
our
common
tendency
to
believe
in
something
good
,
and
to
invest
whatever
we
love
or
whatever
we
lose
with
some
quality
that
be
superior
to
our
own
failing
and
weakness
as
we
know
them
in
our
own
poor
heart
---
by
these
,
hear
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
surely
,
it
be
enough
to
be
fellow
-
creature
.
 
<EOS>
surely
,
it
include
the
other
designation
,
and
some
touch
meaning
over
and
above
.
   
<EOS>
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
personage
introduce
into
the
discourse
(
not
an
absolute
novelty
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
of
my
reading
)
,
who
have
be
personally
know
to
the
preacher
,
and
have
be
quite
a
Crichton
in
all
the
way
of
philosophy
,
but
have
be
an
infidel
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
have
the
preacher
talk
with
him
on
that
subject
,
and
many
a
time
have
he
fail
to
convince
that
intelligent
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
fall
ill
,
and
die
,
and
before
he
die
he
record
his
conversion
---
in
word
which
the
preacher
have
take
down
,
my
fellow
-
sinner
,
and
would
read
to
you
from
this
piece
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
to
me
,
as
one
of
an
uninstructed
audience
,
they
do
not
appear
particularly
edifying
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
their
tone
extremely
selfish
,
and
I
think
they
have
a
spiritual
vanity
in
them
which
be
of
the
before
-
mention
refractory
pauper
's
family
.
   
<EOS>
all
slang
and
twang
be
objectionable
everywhere
,
but
the
slang
and
twang
of
the
conventicle
---
as
bad
in
its
way
as
that
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
nothing
bad
can
be
say
of
it
---
should
be
studiously
avoid
under
such
circumstance
as
I
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
avoidance
be
not
complete
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
quite
agreeable
to
see
the
preacher
address
his
pet
"
point
"
to
his
backer
on
the
stage
,
as
if
appeal
to
those
disciple
to
show
him
up
,
and
testify
to
the
multitude
that
each
of
those
point
be
a
clincher
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
in
respect
of
the
large
Christianity
of
his
general
tone
;
of
his
renunciation
of
all
priestly
authority
;
of
his
earnest
and
reiterate
assurance
to
the
people
that
the
commonest
among
them
could
work
out
their
own
salvation
if
they
would
,
by
simply
,
lovingly
,
and
dutifully
follow
Our
Saviour
,
and
that
they
need
the
mediation
of
no
err
man
;
in
these
particular
,
this
gentleman
deserve
all
praise
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
well
than
the
spirit
,
or
the
plain
emphatic
word
of
his
discourse
in
these
respect
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
most
significant
and
encouraging
circumstance
that
whenever
he
strike
that
chord
,
or
whenever
he
describe
anything
which
Christ
himself
have
do
,
the
array
of
face
before
him
be
very
much
more
earnest
,
and
very
much
more
expressive
of
emotion
,
than
at
any
other
time
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
I
be
bring
to
the
fact
,
that
the
low
part
of
the
audience
of
the
previous
night
,
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
thing
in
that
building
,
that
Sunday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
tell
since
,
that
the
low
part
of
the
audience
of
the
Victoria
Theatre
have
be
attract
to
its
Sunday
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
but
on
this
occasion
of
which
I
write
,
the
low
part
of
the
usual
audience
of
the
Britannia
Theatre
,
decidedly
and
unquestionably
stay
away
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
first
take
my
seat
and
look
at
the
house
,
my
surprise
at
the
change
in
its
occupant
be
as
great
as
my
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
most
respectable
class
of
the
previous
evening
,
be
add
a
great
number
of
respectable
stranger
attract
by
curiosity
,
and
draft
from
the
regular
congregation
of
various
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
fail
in
identify
the
character
of
these
last
,
and
they
be
very
numerous
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
out
in
a
strong
,
slow
tide
of
them
set
from
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
while
the
discourse
be
in
progress
,
the
respectable
character
of
the
auditory
be
so
manifest
in
their
appearance
,
that
when
the
minister
address
a
supposititious
"
outcast
,
"
one
really
feel
a
little
impatient
of
it
,
as
a
figure
of
speech
not
justify
by
anything
the
eye
could
discover
.
   
<EOS>
the
time
appoint
for
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding
be
eight
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
the
address
have
last
until
full
that
time
,
and
it
be
the
custom
to
conclude
with
a
hymn
<EOS>
,
the
preacher
intimate
in
a
few
sensible
word
that
the
clock
have
strike
the
hour
,
and
that
those
who
desire
to
go
before
the
hymn
be
sing
,
could
go
now
,
without
give
offence
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
stir
.
 
<EOS>
the
hymn
be
then
sing
,
in
good
time
and
tune
and
unison
,
and
its
effect
be
very
striking
.
<EOS>
a
comprehensive
benevolent
prayer
dismiss
the
throng
,
and
in
seven
or
eight
minute
there
be
nothing
leave
in
the
Theatre
but
a
light
cloud
of
dust
.
   
<EOS>
that
these
Sunday
meeting
in
theatre
be
good
thing
,
I
do
not
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
doubt
that
they
will
work
lower
and
lower
down
in
the
social
scale
,
if
those
who
preside
over
them
will
be
very
careful
on
two
head
:
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
not
to
disparage
the
place
in
which
they
speak
,
or
the
intelligence
of
their
hearer
;
secondly
,
not
to
set
themselves
in
antagonism
to
the
natural
inborn
desire
of
the
mass
of
mankind
to
recreate
themselves
and
to
be
amuse
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
third
head
,
take
precedence
of
all
other
,
to
which
my
remark
on
the
discourse
I
hear
,
have
tend
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
New
Testament
there
be
the
most
beautiful
and
affect
history
conceivable
by
man
,
and
there
be
the
terse
model
for
all
prayer
and
for
all
preaching
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
model
,
imitate
them
,
Sunday
preacher
---
else
<EOS>
why
be
they
there
,
consider
?
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
history
,
tell
it
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
can
not
read
,
some
people
will
not
read
,
many
people
(
this
especially
hold
among
the
young
and
ignorant
)
find
it
hard
to
pursue
the
verse
-
form
in
which
the
book
be
present
to
them
,
and
imagine
that
those
break
imply
gap
and
want
of
continuity
.
 
<EOS>
help
them
over
that
first
stumbling
-
block
,
by
set
forth
the
history
in
narrative
,
with
no
fear
of
exhaust
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
preach
so
well
<EOS>
,
you
will
never
move
them
so
profoundly
,
you
will
never
send
them
away
with
half
so
much
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
the
well
interest
:
 
Christ
's
choice
of
twelve
poor
man
to
help
in
those
merciful
wonder
among
the
poor
and
reject
;
or
the
pious
bullying
of
a
whole
Union
-
full
of
pauper
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
changed
philosopher
to
wretched
me
,
peep
in
at
the
door
out
of
the
mud
of
the
street
and
of
my
life
,
when
you
have
the
widow
's
son
to
tell
me
about
,
the
ruler
's
daughter
,
the
other
figure
at
the
door
when
the
brother
of
the
two
sister
be
dead
,
and
one
of
the
two
run
to
the
mourner

Poor

who
sit

on
life
of
poor

as

if
not

who

<EOS>
what
be
the
cherub
about

and
what
be
we
all
about
,
when
poor
   
Mercantile
Jack
be
have
his
brain
slowly
knock
out
by
penny
-
weight
,
aboard
the
brig
Beelzebub
,
or
the
barque
Bowie
-
knife
---
when
he
look
his
last
at
that
infernal
craft
,
with
the
first
officer
's
iron
boot

heel
in
his

while
the
cruel

in

"
the

<EOS>
be
it
unreasonable
to
entertain
a
belief
that
if
,
aboard
the
brig
Beelzebub
or
the
barque
Bowie
-
knife
,
the
first
officer
do
half
the
damage
to
cotton
that
he
do
to
man
,
there
would
presently
arise
from
both
side
of
the
Atlantic
so
vociferous
an
invocation
of
the
sweet
little
cherub
who
sit
calculate
aloft
,
keep
watch
on
the
market
that
pay
,
that
such
vigilant
cherub
would
,
with
a
winged
sword
,
have
that
gallant
officer
's
organ
of
destructiveness
out
of
his
head
in
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
?
   
<EOS>
if
it
be
unreasonable
,
then
be
I
the
most
unreasonable
of
man
,
for
I
believe
it
with
all
my
soul
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
my
thought
as
I
walk
the
dock
-
quay
at
Liverpool
,
keep
watch
on
poor
Mercantile
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
long
outgrow
the
state
of
sweet
little
cherub
;
but
there
I
be
,
and
there
Mercantile
Jack
be
,
and
very
busy
he
be
,
and
very
cold
<EOS>
he
be
:
 
<EOS>
the
snow
yet
lie
in
the
frozen
furrow
of
the
land
,
and
the
north

east
wind
snip
off
the
top
of
the
little
wave
in
the
Mersey
,
and
roll
them
into
hailstone
to
pelt
him
with
.
<EOS>
Mercantile
Jack
be
hard
at
it
,
in
the
hard
weather
:
 
as
he
mostly
be
in
all
weather
,
poor
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
gird
to
ship
'
mast
and
funnel
of
steamer
,
like
a
forester
to
a
great
oak
,
scraping
and
painting
;
he
be
lie
out
on
yard
,
furl
sail
that
try
to
beat
him
off
;
he
be
dimly
discernible
up
in
a
world
of
giant
cobwebs
,
reefing
and
splicing
;
he
be
faintly
audible
down
in
hold
,
stow
and
unship
cargo
;
he
be
wind
round
and
round
at
capstan
melodious
,
monotonous
,
and
drunk
;
he
be
of
a
diabolical
aspect
,
with
coal
for
the
Antipodes
;
he
be
wash
deck
barefoot
,
with
the
breast
of
his
red
shirt
open
to
the
blast
,
though
it
be
sharp
than
the
knife
in
his
leathern
girdle
;
he
be
look
over
bulwark
,
all
eye
and
hair
;
he
be
stand
by
at
the
shoot
of
the
Cunard
steamer
,
off
to
-
morrow
,
as
the
stock
in
trade
of
several
butcher
,
poulterer
,
and
fishmonger
,
pour
down
into
the
ice

house
;
he
be
come
aboard
of
other
vessel
,
with
his
kit
in
a
tarpaulin
bag
,
attend
by
plunderer
to
the
very
last
moment
of
his
shore
-
go
existence
.
 
<EOS>
as
though
his
sense
,
when
release
from
the
uproar
of
the
element
,
be
under
obligation
to
be
confuse
by
other
turmoil
,
there
be
a
rattling
of
wheel
,
a
clattering
of
hoofs
,
a
clashing
of
iron
,
a
jolting
of
cotton
and
hide
and
cask
and
timber
,
an
incessant
deafen
disturbance
on
the
quay
,
that
be
the
very
madness
of
sound
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
,
in
the
midst
of
it
,
he
stand
sway
about
,
with
his
hair
blow
all
manner
of
wild
way
,
rather
crazedly
take
leave
of
his
plunderer
,
all
the
rigging
in
the
dock
be
shrill
in
the
wind
,
and
every
little
steamer
come
and
go
across
the
Mersey
<EOS>
be
sharp
in
its
blowing
off
,
and
every
buoy
in
the
river
bob
spitefully
up
and
down
,
as
if
there
be
a
general
taunt
chorus
of
"

<EOS>
Ill

<EOS>
come

Poor
Mercantile
Jack

and

tempest

toss
till
you

drown

"
   
<EOS>
the
uncommercial
transaction
which
have
bring
me
and
Jack
together
,
be
this
:
---
I
have
enter
the
Liverpool
police
force
,
that
I
may
have
a
look
at
the
various
unlawful
trap
which
be
every
night
set
for
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
term
of
service
in
that
distinguished
corp
be
short
,
and
as
my
personal
bias
in
the
capacity
of
one
of
its
member
have
cease
,
no
suspicion
will
attach
to
my
evidence
that
it
be
an
admirable
force
.
 
<EOS>
besides
that
it
be
compose
,
without
favour
,
of
the
good
man
that
can
be
pick
,
it
be
direct
by
an
unusual
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
Its
organisation
against
fire
<EOS>
,
I
take
to
be
much
well
than
the
metropolitan
system
,
and
in
all
respect
it
temper
its
remarkable
vigilance
with
a
still
more
remarkable
discretion
.
   
<EOS>
Jack
have
knock
off
work
in
the
dock
some
hour
,
and
I
have
take
,
for
purpose
of
identification
,
a
photograph
-
likeness
of
a
thief
,
in
the
portrait
-
room
at
our
head
police
office
(
on
the
whole
,
he
seem
rather
compliment
by
the
proceeding
)
,
and
I
have
be
on
police
parade
,
and
the
small
hand
of
the
clock
be
move
on
to
ten
,
when
I
take
up
my
lantern
to
follow
Mr
Superintendent
to
the
trap
that
be
set
for
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
in
Mr
Superintendent
I
see
,
as
anybody
may
,
a
tall
,
well
-
look
,
well
-
set
-
up
man
of
a
soldierly
bear
,
with
a
cavalry
air
,
a
good
chest
,
and
a
resolute
but
not
by
any
mean
ungentle
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
in
his
hand
a
plain
black
walking
-
stick
of
hard
wood
;
and
whenever
and
wherever
,
at
any
after
-
time
of
the
night
,
he
strike
it
on
the
pavement
with
a
ring
sound
,
it
instantly
produce
a
whistle
out
of
the
darkness
,
and
a
policeman
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
remarkable
stick
,
I
refer
an
air
of
mystery
and
magic
which
pervade
the
whole
of
my
perquisition
among
the
trap
that
be
set
for
Jack
.
   
<EOS>
We
begin
by
dive
into
the
obscure
street
and
lane
of
the
port
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
pause
in
a
flow
of
cheerful
discourse
,
before
a
dead
wall
,
apparently
some
ten
mile
long
,
Mr
Superintendent
strike
upon
the
ground
,
and
the
wall
open
and
shoot
out
,
with
military
salute
of
hand
to
temple
,
two
policeman
---
not
in
the
least
surprise
themselves
,
not
in
the
least
surprising
Mr
Superintendent
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
right

Sharpeye

"
   
<EOS>
"
all

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

"
   
<EOS>
so
,
Sharpeye
go
before
,
and
Mr
Superintendent
<EOS>
and
I
go
next
,
and
Trampfoot
and
Quickear
march
as
rear
-
guard
.
 
<EOS>
Sharp
-
eye
,
I
soon
have
occasion
to
remark
,
have
a
skilful
and
quite
professional
way
of
opening
door
---
touch
latch
delicately
,
as
if
they
be
key
of
musical
instrument
---
open
every
door
he
touch
,
as
if
he
be
perfectly
confident
that
there
be
steal
property
behind
it
---
instantly
insinuate
himself
,
to
prevent
its
be
shut
.
   
<EOS>
Sharpeye
open
several
door
of
trap
that
be
set
for
Jack
,
but
Jack
do
not
happen
to
be
in
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
such
miserable
place
that
really
,
Jack
,
if
I
be
you
,
I
would
give
them
a
wide
berth
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
trap
,
somebody
be
sit
over
a
fire
,
wait
for
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
a
crouch
old
woman
,
like
the
picture
of
the
Norwood
Gipsy
in
the
old
sixpenny
dream
-
book
;
now
,
it
be
a
crimp
of
the
male
sex
,
in
a
check
shirt
and
without
a
coat
,
read
a
newspaper
;
now
,
it
be
a
man
crimp
and
a
woman
crimp
,
who
always
introduce
themselves
as
united
in
holy
matrimony
;
now
,
it
be
Jack
's
delight
,
his
(
un)lovely
Nan
;
but
they
be
all
wait
for
Jack
,
and
be
all
frightfully
disappointed
to
see
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
who
have
you
get
up

stair
here
?
<EOS>
"
say
Sharpeye
,
generally
.
 
<EOS>
(
in
the
move

on

)
   
<EOS>
"
nobody

<EOS>
"
what
do
you

<EOS>

not
I
hear
a

step
go
up

"
   
<EOS>
generally
,
Betsy
look
over
the
banister
(
the
steep
staircase
be
in
the
room
)
with
a
forcible
expression
in
her
protest
face
,
of
an
intention
to
compensate
herself
for
the
present
trial
by
grind
Jack
fine
than
usual
when
he
do
come
.
 
<EOS>
Generally
,
Sharpeye
turn
to
Mr
Superintendent
,
and
say
,
as
if
the
subject
of
his
remark
be
wax
-
work
:
   
<EOS>
"
one

say
the
woman

<EOS>
generally
,
the
man
say
nothing
at
all
,
but
become
exceedingly
round
-
shoulder
,
and
pretend
to
read
his
paper
with
rapt
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Generally
,
Sharpeye
direct
our
observation
with
a
look
,
to
the
print
and
picture
that
be
invariably
numerous
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
always
,
Trampfoot
and
Quickear
be
take
notice
on
the
doorstep

<EOS>
in
default
of
Sharpeye
be
acquaint
with
the
exact
individuality
of
any
gentleman
encounter
,
one
of
these
two
be
sure
to
proclaim
from
the
outer
air
,
like
a
gruff
spectre
,
that
Jackson
be
not
Jackson
,
but
know
himself
to
be
Fogle
;
or
that
Canlon
be
Walker
's
brother
,
against
whom
there
be
not
sufficient
evidence

that
the
man
who
say
he
never
be
at

since
he
be
a
boy
,
come
ashore
from
a
voyage
last
Thursday

<EOS>
"

that

you
see
,
"
say
Mr
Superintendent
,
when
he
get
out
into
the
dark
again
,
"

very
difficult
to

with

who

enter
himself
for

It

at

even
here

that
I

expectation

himself

he

<EOS>
always
on

<EOS>
when
he
hear
of
talent

trust
nobody
's
account

it

but
go
off
by
rail
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
true

<EOS>
pound
a

<EOS>
Banjo
Bones
be
undoubted
talent
.
 
<EOS>
hear
this
instrument
that
be
go
to
play
---
it
be
real
talent
!
 
<EOS>
in
truth
it
be
very
good
;
a
kind
of
piano
-
accordion
,
play
by
a
young
girl
of
a
delicate
prettiness
of
face
,
figure
,
and
dress
,
that
make
the
audience
look
coarser
.
 
<EOS>
She
sing
to
the
instrument
,
too
;
<EOS>
first
,
a
song
about
village
bell
,
and
how
they
chime
;
then
a
song
about
how
I
go
to
sea
;
wind
up
with
an
imitation
of
the
bagpipe
,
which
Mercantile
Jack
seem
to
understand
much
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
girl
,
say
Mr
Licensed
Victualler
.
 
<EOS>
keep
herself
select

<EOS>
Sat

not
listen

<EOS>
once
a

well

over
-
speculate
himself
.
 
<EOS>
on
delicate
inquiry
as
to
salary
pay
for
item
of
talent
under
consideration
,
Mr
Victualler
's
pound
drop
suddenly
to
shilling
---
still
it
be
a
very
comfortable
thing
for
a
young
person
like
that
,
you
know
;
she
only
go
on
six
time
a
night
,
and
be
only
require
to
be
there
from
six
at
night
to
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
more
conclusive
be
,
Mr
Victualler
's
assurance
that
he
"
never
allow
any
language
,
and
never
suffer
any
disturbance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sharpeye
confirm
the
statement
,
and
the
order
that
prevail
be
the
good
proof
of
it
that
could
have
be
cite
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
I
come
to
the
conclusion
that
poor
Mercantile
Jack
may
do
(
as
I
be
afraid
he
do
)
much
bad
than
trust
himself
to
Mr
Victualler

pass
his
evening

the

be
now
well
on
into

,
for
mile

hour
we
explore
a
strange
world
,
where
nobody
ever
go
to
bed
,
but
everybody
be
eternally
sit
up
,
wait
for
Jack

<EOS>
this
exploration
be
among

labyrinth
of
dismal
court

alley
,
call

keep
in
wonderful
order

well

the

infamous
of

be
quite
unworthy

<EOS>
I

describe
<EOS>

two
or
three
of
the
house
in
which

wait
for
as
specimen
of
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
many
we
attain
by
noisome
passage
so
profoundly
dark
that
we
feel
our
way
with
our
hand
.
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
whole
number
we
visit
,
be
without
its
show
of
print
and
ornamental
crockery
;
the
quantity
of
the
latter
set
forth
on
little
shelf
and
in
little
case
,
in
otherwise
wretched
room
,
indicate
that
Mercantile
Jack
must
have
an
extraordinary
fondness
for
crockery
,
to
necessitate
so
much
of
that
bait
in
his
trap
.

among
such
garniture

<EOS>
the
cracked
guitar
raise
the
feeble
ghost
of
a
tune
,
and
three
of
the
woman
keep
time
to
it
with
their
head
,
and
the
fourth
with
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
if
Antonio
have
bring
any
money
in
with
him
,
I
be
afraid
he
will
never
take
it
out
,
and
it
even
strike
me
that
his
jacket
and
guitar
may
be
in
a
bad
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
look
of
the
young
man
and
the
tinkling
of
the
instrument
so
change
the
place
in
a
moment
to
a
leaf
out
of
Don
Quixote
,
that
I
wonder
where
his
mule
be
stabled
,
until
he
leave
off
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
acknowledge
(
as
it
tend
rather
to
my
uncommercial
confusion
)
,
that
I
occasion
a
difficulty
in
this
establishment
,
by
have
take
the
child
in
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
on
my
offering
to
restore
it
to
a
ferocious
joker
not
unstimulate
by
rum
,
who
claim
to
be
its
mother
,
that
unnatural
parent
put
her
hand
behind
her
,
and
decline
to
accept
it
;
back
into
the
fireplace
,
and
very
shrilly
declare
,
regardless
of
remonstrance
from
her
friend
,
that
she
know
it
to
be
Law
,
that
whoever
take
a
child
from
its
mother
of
his
own
will
,
be
bind
to
stick
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
uncommercial
sense
of
be
in
a
rather
ridiculous
position
with
the
poor
little
child
begin
to
be
frightened
,
be
relieve
by
my
worthy
friend
and
fellow
-
constable
,
Trampfoot
;
who
,
lay
hand
on
the
article
as
if
it
be
a
Bottle
,
pass
it
on
to
the
near
woman
,
and
bade
<EOS>
her
"
take
hold
of
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
we
come
out
the
Bottle
be
pass
to
the
ferocious
joker
,
and
they
all
sit
down
as
before
,
include
Antonio
and
the
guitar
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
nightcap
to
this
baby
's
head
,
and
that
even
he
never
go
to
bed
,
but
be
always
keep
up

and
would
grow
up
,
keep
up

wait
for
Jack

<EOS>
later
still
in
the
night
,
we
come
(
by
the
court
"
where
the
man
be
murder

"
and
by
the
other
court
across
the
street

into
which
his
body
be

to
another
parlour
in
another
Entry
,
where
several
people
be
sit
round
a
fire
in
just
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dirty
and
offensive
place
,
with
some
ragged
clothe
dry
in
it
;
but
there
be
a
high
shelf
over
the
entrance
-
door
(
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
maraud
hand
,
possibly
)
with
two
large
white

on
it

and
a
great
piece
of
Cheshire

<EOS>

<EOS>
the
young
man
here
,
take
the
reply
upon
himself
,
and
shortly
answer
,
"

<EOS>
the

modestly

behind
a
damp

pendent
from
a

<EOS>
as
I
glance
at
him
I
become
---
but
I
do
not
know
why
---
vaguely
reminded
of
Woolwich
,
Chatham
,
Portsmouth
,
and
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
get
out
,
my
respected
fellow
-
constable
Sharpeye
,
address
Mr
Superintendent
,
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
You

that
young
man

sir

in

Darby

Deserter

<EOS>
Mr

further
intimate
that
when
we
have
do
with
his
service
,
he
will
step
back
and
take
that
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
which
in
course
of
time
he
do
:
 
feeling
at
perfect
ease
about
find
him
,
and
know
for
a
moral
certainty
that
nobody
in
that
region
will
be
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
later
still
in
the
night
,
we
come
to
another
parlour
up
a
step
or
two
from
the
street
,
which
be
very
cleanly
,
neatly
,
even
tastefully

and
in

on
a

the

be
such
a
profusion
of
ornamental

that
it
would
have
furnish
forth
a
handsome

<EOS>
It

"

"
   
<EOS>
the
copy
admonish
human
nature
to
subjugate
the
fire
of
every
fierce
desire
.
 
<EOS>
one
may
have
think
it
recommend
stir
the
fire
,
the
old

so
approve
it

<EOS>
there
she
sit
,
rosily
beam
at
the

and
the

,
and
invoke
shower
of
blessing
on
our
head
,
when
we
leave
her
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
wait
for
Jack
.
   
<EOS>
later
still
in
the
night
,
we
come
to
a
nauseous
room
with
an
earth
floor
,
into
which
the
refuse
scum
of
an
alley
trickle
.
 
<EOS>
the
stench
of
this
habitation
be
abominable
;
the
seem
poverty
of
it
,
diseased
and
dire
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
here
again
,
be
visitor
or
lodger
---
a
man
sit
before
the
fire
,
like
the
rest
of
them
elsewhere
,
and
apparently
not
distasteful
to
the
mistress
's
niece
,
who
be
also
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistress
herself
have
the
misfortune
of
be
in
jail
.
   
<EOS>
three
weird
old
woman
of
transcendent
ghastliness
,
be
at
needlework
at
a

in
this

the

,
shake
her

and
set
her

"

"
   
<EOS>
She
hold
up
a
common

and
on

a
heap
of
such

<EOS>
First
Witch
have
a
circle
round
each
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
it
like
the
beginning
of
the
development
of
a
perverted
diabolical
halo
,
and
that
when
it
spread
all
round
her
head
,
she
will
die
in
the
odour
of
devilry
.
   
<EOS>
Trampfoot
wish
to
be
inform
what
First

have
get
behind
the
table
,
down
by
the
side

there

<EOS>
Witches
Two
and
three
croak
angrily
<EOS>
,
"

"
   
<EOS>
She
drag
out
a
skinny
little
arm
from
a
brown
dustheap
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Adjured
not
to
disturb
the
child
,
she
let
it
drop
again
.
<EOS>
thus
we
find
at
last
that
there
be
one
child
in
the
world
of
Entries
who
go
to
bed
---
if
this
be
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Superintendent
ask
how
long
be
they
go
to
work
at
those
bag
?
   
<EOS>
how
long
?
 
<EOS>
First
Witch
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
go
to
have
supper
presently

<EOS>
see
the

<EOS>
ay

<EOS>
but
we
have
to

our
supper
afore
<EOS>
we

"
 
<EOS>
both
the
other
witch
repeat
this
after
First
Witch
,
and
take
the
uncommercial
measurement
with
their
eye
,
as
for
a
charm
winding

sheet
.
<EOS>
some
grim
discourse
ensue
,
refer
to
the
mistress
of
the
cave
,
who
will
be
release
from
jail
to

morrow

<EOS>
witch
pronounce
Trampfoot
"
right

"
when
he
deem
it
a
try
distance
for
the
old
lady
to
walk
;
she
shall
be
fetch
by
niece
in
a
spring
-
cart
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
take
a
parting
look
at
First
Witch
in
turn
away
,
the
red
mark
round
her
eye
seem
to
have
already
grow
large
,
and
she
hungrily
and
thirstily
look
out
beyond
me
into
the
dark
doorway
,
to
see
if
Jack
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
Jack
come
even
here
,
and
the
mistress
have
get
into
jail
through
delude
Jack
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
at
last
end
this
night
of
travel
and
get
to
bed
,
I
fail
to
keep
my
mind
on
comfortable
thought
of
Seaman
's
home
(
not
overdo
with
strictness
)
,
and
improve
dock
regulation
give
Jack
great
benefit
of
fire
and
candle
aboard
ship
,
through
my
mind
be
wander
among
the
vermin
I
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
the
same
vermin
run
all
over
my
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Evermore
,
when
on
a
breezy
day
I
see
Poor
Mercantile
Jack
run
into
port
with
a
fair
wind
under
all
sail
,
I
shall
think
of
the
unsleepe
host
of
devourer
who
never
go
to
bed
,
and
be
always
in
their
set
trap
wait
for
him

Number
5
:
refreshment
for
traveller
 
<EOS>
in
the
late
high
wind
I
be
blow
to
a
great
many
place
---
and
indeed
,
wind
or
no
wind
,
I
generally
have
extensive
transaction
on
hand
in
the
article
of
Air
---
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
be
blow
to
any
english
place
lately
,
and
I
very
seldom
have
blow
to
any
english
place
in
my
life
,
where
I
could
get
anything
good
to
eat
and
drink
in
five
minute
,
or
where
,
if
I
seek
it
,
I
be
receive
with
a
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
curious
thing
to
consider
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
(
stimulate
by
my
own
experience
and
the
representation
of
many
fellow
-
traveller
of
every
uncommercial
and
commercial
degree
)
I
consider
it
further
,
I
must
utter
a
pass
word
of
wonder
concern
high
wind
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
metropolitan
gale
always
blow
so
hard
at
Walworth
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
Walworth
have
do
,
to
bring
such
windy
punishment
upon
itself
,
as
I
never
fail
to
find
record
in
the
newspaper
when
the
wind
have
blow
at
all
hard
.
 
<EOS>
Brixton
seem
to
have
something
on
its
conscience
;
Peckham
suffer
more
than
a
virtuous
Peckham
may
be
suppose
to
deserve
;
the
howl
neighbourhood
of
Deptford
figure
largely
in
the
account
of
the
ingenious
gentleman
who
be
out
in
every
wind
that
blow
,
and
to
whom
it
be
an
ill
high
wind
that
blow
no
good
;
but
,
there
can
hardly
be
any
Walworth
leave
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
surely
be
blow
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
more
chimney
-
stack
and
house
-
coping
come
down
with
terrific
smash
at
Walworth
,
and
of
more
sacred
edifice
be
nearly
(
not
quite
)
blow
out
to
sea
from
the
same
accurse
locality
,
than
I
have
read
of
practised
thief
with
the
appearance
and
manner
of
gentleman
---
a
popular
phenomenon
which
never
exist
on
earth
out
of
fiction
and
a
police
report
.
 
<EOS>
again
:
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
people
be
always
blow
into
the
Surrey
Canal
,
and
into
no
other
piece
of
water
!
 
<EOS>
why
do
people
get
up
early
and
go
out
in
group
,
to
be
blow
into
the
Surrey
Canal
?
 
<EOS>
do
they
say
to
one
another
,
"
welcome
death
,
so
that
we
get
into
the
newspaper
'
?
 
<EOS>
even
that
would
be
an
insufficient
explanation
,
because
even
then
they
may
sometimes
put
themselves
in
the
way
of
be
blow
into
the
Regent
's
Canal
,
instead
of
always
saddle
Surrey
for
the
field
.
<EOS>
some
nameless
policeman
,
too
,
be
constantly
,
on
the
slight
provocation
,
get
himself
blow
into
this
same
Surrey
Canal
.
<EOS>
Will
SIR
RICHARD
MAYNE
see
to
it
,
and
restrain
that
weak
-
minded
and
feeble
-
bodied
constable
?
   
<EOS>
to
resume
the
consideration
of
the
curious
question
of
Refreshment
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
Briton
,
and
,
as
such
,
I
be
aware
that
I
never
will
be
a
slave
---
<EOS>
and
yet
I
have
latent
suspicion
that
there
must
be
some
slavery
of
wrong
custom
in
this
matter
.
   
<EOS>
I
travel
by
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
start
from
home
at
seven
or
eight
in
the
morning
,
after
breakfast
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
what
with
skim
over
the
open
landscape
,
what
with
mining
in
the
damp
bowel
of
the
earth
,
what
with
banging
,
boom
and
shriek
the
score
of
mile
away
,
I
be
hungry
when
I
arrive
at
the
"
Refreshment
"
station
where
I
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
please
to
observe
,
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
say
,
I
be
hungry
;
perhaps
I
may
say
,
with
great
point
and
force
,
that
I
be
to
some
extent
exhaust
,
and
that
I
need
---
in
the
expressive
french
sense
of
the
word
---
to
be
restore
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
provide
for
my
restoration
?
 
<EOS>
the
apartment
that
be
to
restore
me
be
a
wind
-
trap
,
cunningly
set
to
inveigle
all
the
draught
in
that
country
-
side
,
and
to
communicate
a
special
intensity
and
velocity
to
them
as
they
rotate
in
two
hurricane
:
 
one
,
about
my
wretched
head
:
 
one
,
about
my
wretched
leg
.
 
<EOS>
the
training
of
the
young
lady
behind
the
counter
who
be
to
restore
me
,
have
be
from
their
infancy
direct
to
the
assumption
of
a
defiant
dramatic
show
that
I
be
not
expect
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
me
to
represent
to
them
by
my
humble
and
conciliatory
manner
,
that
I
wish
to
be
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
me
to
represent
to
myself
,
for
the
encouragement
of
my
sinking
soul
,
that
the
young
lady
have
a
pecuniary
interest
in
my
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
neither
my
reason
nor
my
feeling
can
make
head
against
the
cold
glaze
glare
of
eye
with
which
I
be
assure
that
I
be
not
expect
,
and
not
want
.
 
<EOS>
the
solitary
man
among
the
bottle
would
sometimes
take
pity
on
me
,
if
he
dare
,
but
he
be
powerless
against
the
right
and
might
of
woman
.
 
<EOS>
(
of
the
page
I
make
no
account
,
for
<EOS>
,
he
be
a
boy
,
and
therefore
the
natural
enemy
of
Creation
.
)
<EOS>
chill
fast
,
in
the
deadly
tornado
to
which
my
upper
and
low
extremity
be
expose
,
and
subdue
by
the
moral
disadvantage
at
which
I
stand
,
I
turn
my
disconsolate
eye
on
the
refreshment
that
be
to
restore
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
must
either
scald
my
throat
by
insanely
ladle
into
it
,
against
time
and
for
no
wager
<EOS>
,
brown
hot
water
stiffen
with
flour
;
or
I
must
make
myself
flaky
and
sick
with
Banbury
cake
;
or
,
I
must
stuff
into
my
delicate
organisation
,
a
currant
pincushion
which
I
know
will
swell
into
immeasurable
dimension
when
it
have
get
there
;
or
,
I
must
extort
from
an
iron
-
bind
quarry
,
with
a
fork
,
as
if
I
be
farm
an
inhospitable
soil
,
some
glutinous
lump
of
gristle
and
grease
,
call
pork
-
pie
.
<EOS>
while
thus
forlornly
occupy
,
I
find
that
the
depressing
banquet
on
the
table
be
,
in
every
phase
of
its
profoundly
unsatisfactory
character
,
so
like
the
banquet
at
the
mean
and
shabby
of
evening
party
,
that
I
begin
to
think
I
must
have
"
bring
down
"
to
supper
,
the
old
lady
unknown
,
blue
with
cold
,
who
be
set
her
tooth
on
edge
with
a
cool
orange
at
my
elbow
---
that
the
pastrycook
who
have
compound
for
the
company
on
the
low
term
per
head
,
be
a
fraudulent
bankrupt
,
redeem
his
contract
with
the
stale
stock
from
his
window
<EOS>
---
that
,
for
some
unexplained
reason
,
the
family
give
the
party
have
become
my
mortal
foe
,
and
have
give
it
on
purpose
to
affront
me
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
I
fancy
that
I
be
"
break
up
"
again
,
at
the
evening
conversazione
at
school
,
charge
two
-
and
-
sixpence
in
the
half
-
year
's
bill
;
or
break
down
again
at
that
celebrate
evening
party
give
at
Mrs
Bogles
's
boarding
-
house
when
I
be
a
boarder
there
,
on
which
occasion
Mrs
Bogles
be
take
in
execution
by
a
branch
of
the
legal
profession
who
get
in
as
the
harp
,
and
be
remove
(
with
the
key
and
subscribe
capital
)
to
a
place
of
durance
,
half
an
hour
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
festivity
.
   
<EOS>
take

all

mental
comparison

curiosity

now
,
as

rather
like

half

the
other

change
his
leg
,
and
take
a
new
view
of
you
,
doubtfully
,
now
,
as
if
he
have
reject
the
resemblance
to
his
brother
,
and
have
begin
to
think
you
more
like
his
aunt
or
his
grandmother

<EOS>
again
you
beseech
your
waiter
with
pathetic
indignation
,
to

even
then

he
will
not
take
the
sham
silver
cover
off
,
without
a
pause
for
a
flourish
,
and
a
look
at
the
musty
cutlet
as
if
he
be
surprised
to
see
it
---
which
can
not
possibly
be
the
case
,
he
must
have
see
it
so
often
before

a

You
know

you

never

and
you
imperatively
demand
your
bill
;
but
,
it
take
time
to

suspiciously

now

and
let

We

We

We

get
on
very
well
indeed
at
such
a

still
not
perfectly
well

this
may
be
,
because
the

wholesale

there

personal

My

just

the

so
long

any

hang
on
his
breast
---
"
from
his
mother
,
"
<EOS>
be
engraven
on
it
---
who
have
come
into
the
net
across
the
river
,
with
a
bullet
wound
in
his
fair
forehead
and
<EOS>
his
hand
cut
with
a
knife
,
but
whence
or
how
be
a
blank
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
this
time
,
I
be
force
into
the
same
dread
place
,
to
see
a
large
dark
man
whose
disfigurement
by
water
be
in
a
frightful
manner
comic
,
and
whose
expression
be
that
of
a
prize
-
fighter
who
have
close
his
eyelid
under
a
heavy
blow
,
but
be
go
immediately
to
open
them
,
shake
his
head
,
and
"
come
up
smile
.
"
 
<EOS>
oh
what
this
large
dark
man
cost
me
in
that
bright
city
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
hot
weather
,
and
he
be
none
the
well
for
that
,
and
I
be
much
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
a
very
neat
and
pleasant
little
woman
with
the
key
of
her
lodging
on
her
forefinger
,
who
have
be
show
him
to
her
little
girl
while
she
and
the
child
eat
sweetmeat
,
<EOS>
observe
monsieur
look
poorly
as
we
come
out
together
,
and
ask
monsieur
,
with
her
wonder
little
eyebrow
prettily
raise
,
if
there
be
anything
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
faintly
reply
in
the
negative
,
monsieur
cross
the
road
to
a
wine
-
shop
,
get
some
brandy
,
and
resolve
to
freshen
himself
with
a
dip
in
the
great
float
bath
on
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
the
bath
be
crowd
in
the
usual
airy
manner
,
by
a
male
population
in
stripe
drawer
of
various
gay
colour
,
who
walk
up
and
down
arm
in
arm
,
drank
coffee
,
smoke
cigar
,
sit
at
little
table
,
converse
politely
with
the
damsel
who
dispense
the
towel
,
and
every
now
and
then
pitch
themselves
into
the
river
head
foremost
,
and
come
out
again
to
repeat
this
social
routine
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
haste
to
participate
in
the
water
part
of
the
entertainment
,
and
be
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
a
delightful
bath
,
when
all
in
a
moment
I
be
seize
with
an
unreasonable
idea
that
the
large
dark
body
be
float
straight
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
the
river
,
and
dress
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
shock
I
have
take
some
water
into
my
mouth
,
and
it
turn
me
sick
,
for
I
fancy
that
the
contamination
of
the
creature
be
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
back
to
my
cool
darkened
room
in
the
hotel
,
and
be
lie
on
a
sofa
there
,
before
I
begin
to
reason
with
myself
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
know
perfectly
well
that
the
large
dark
creature
be
stone
dead
,
and
that
I
should
no
more
come
upon
him
out
of
the
place
where
I
have
see
him
dead
,
than
I
should
come
upon
the
cathedral
of
Notre
-
Dame
in
an
entirely
new
situation
.
 
<EOS>
what
trouble
me
be
the
picture
of
the
creature
;
and
that
have
so
curiously
and
strongly
paint
itself
upon
my
brain
,
that
I
could
not
get
rid
of
it
until
it
be
wear
out
.
   
<EOS>
I
notice
the
peculiarity
of
this
possession
,
while
it
be
a
real
discomfort
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
very
day
,
at
dinner
,
some
morsel
on
my
plate
look
like
a
piece
of
him
,
and
I
be
glad
to
get
up
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
later
in
the
evening
,
I
be
walk
along
the
Rue
St
Honore
,
when
I
see
a
bill
at
a
public
room
there
,
announce
small
-
sword
exercise
,
broad
-
sword
exercise
,
wrestling
,
and
other
such
feat
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
and
some
of
the
sword
-
play
be
very
skilful
,
remain
.
<EOS>
a
speciman
of
our
own
national
sport
,
the
British
Boaxe
,
be
announce
to
be
give
at
the
close
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
evil
hour
,
I
determine
to
wait
for
this
Boaxe
,
as
become
a
Briton
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
clumsy
speciman
(
execute
by
two
english
groom
out
of
place
)
,
but
one
of
the
combatant
,
receive
a
straight
right
-
hander
with
the
glove
between
his
eye
,
do
exactly
what
the
large
dark
creature
in
the
Morgue
have
seem
go
to
do
---
and
finish
me
for
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
rather
a
sickly
smell
(
not
at
all
an
unusual
fragrance
in
Paris
)
in
the
little
ante
-
room
of
my
apartment
at
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
the
large
dark
creature
in
the
Morgue
be
by
no
direct
experience
associate
with
my
sense
of
smell
,
because
,
when
I
come
to
the
knowledge
of
him
,
he
lie
behind
a
wall
of
thick
plate
-
glass
as
good
as
a
wall
of
steel
or
marble
for
that
matter
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
whiff
of
the
room
never
fail
to
reproduce
him
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
more
curious
,
be
the
capriciousness
with
which
his
portrait
seem
to
light
itself
up
in
my
mind
,
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
walk
in
the
Palais
Royal
,
lazily
enjoy
the
shop
window
,
and
may
be
regale
myself
with
one
of
the
ready
-
make
clothe
shop
that
be
set
out
there
.
 
<EOS>
My
eye
,
wander
over
impossible
-
waiste
dressing
-
gown
and
luminous
waistcoat
,
would
fall
upon
the
master
,
or
the
shopman
,
or
even
the
very
dummy
at
the
door
,
and
would
suggest
to
me
,
"
something
like
him
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
instantly
I
be
sicken
again
.
   
<EOS>
this
would
happen
at
the
theatre
,
in
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
often
it
would
happen
in
the
street
,
when
I
certainly
be
not
look
for
the
likeness
,
and
when
probably
there
be
no
likeness
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
because
the
creature
be
dead
that
I
be
so
haunted
,
because
I
know
that
I
may
have
be
(
<EOS>
and
I
know
it
because
I
have
be
)
equally
attend
by
the
image
of
a
live
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
about
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
do
not
fade
by
degree
,
in
the
sense
that
it
become
a
whit
less
forcible
and
distinct
,
but
in
the
sense
that
it
obtrude
itself
less
and
less
frequently
.
 
<EOS>
the
experience
may
be
worth
consider
by
some
who
have
the
care
of
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
overstate
the
intensity
and
accuracy
of
an
intelligent
child
's
observation
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
impressible
time
of
life
,
it
must
sometimes
produce
a
fix
impression
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
fix
impression
be
of
an
object
terrible
to
the
child
,
it
will
be
(
for
want
of
reason
upon
)
inseparable
from
great
fear
.
 
<EOS>
force
<EOS>
the
child
at
such
a
time
,
be
spartan
with
it
,
send
it
into
the
dark
against
its
will
,
leave
it
in
a
lonely
bedroom
against
its
will
,
and
you
have
well
murder
it
.
   
<EOS>
on
a
bright
morning
I
rattle
away
from
Paris
,
in
the
german
chariot
,
and
leave
the
large
dark
creature
behind
me
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
confess
,
though
,
that
I
have
be
draw
back
to
the
Morgue
,
after
he
be
put
underground
,
to
look
at
his
clothe
,
and
that
I
find
them
frightfully
like
him
---
particularly
his
boot
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
rattle
away
for
Switzerland
,
look
forward
and
not
backward
,
and
so
we
part
company
.
   
<EOS>
welcome
again
,
the
long
,
long
spell
of
France
,
with
the
queer
country
inn
,
full
of
vase
of
flower
and
clock
,
in
the
dull
little
town
,
and
with
the
little
population
not
at
all
dull
on
the
little
Boulevard
in
the
evening
,
under
the
little
tree
!
 
<EOS>
welcome
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Cure
,
walk
alone
in
the
early
morning
a
short
way
out
of
the
town
,
read
that
eternal
Breviary
of
yours
,
which
surely
may
be
almost
read
,
without
book
,
by
this
time
!
 
<EOS>
welcome
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Cure
,
later
in
the
day
,
jolt
through
the
highway
dust
(
as
if
you
have
already
ascend
to
the
cloudy
region
)
,
in
a
very
big
-
headed
cabriolet
,
with
the
dry
mud
of
a
dozen
winter
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
welcome
again
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Cure
,
as
we
exchange
salutation
;
you
,
straighten
your
back
to
look
at
the
german
chariot
,
while
pick
in
your
little
village
garden
a
vegetable
or
two
for
the
day
's
soup
:
 
<EOS>
I
,
look
out
of
the
german
chariot
window
in
that
delicious
traveller
's
trance
which
know
no
care
,
no
yesterday
,
no
to
-
morrow
,
nothing
but
the
pass
object
and
the
pass
scent
and
sound
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
come
,
in
due
course
of
delight
,
to
Strasbourg
,
where
I
pass
a
wet
Sunday
evening
at
a
window
,
while
an
idle
trifle
of
a
vaudeville
be
play
for
me
at
the
opposite
house
.
   
<EOS>
how
such
a
large
house
come
to
have
only
three
people
live
in
it
,
be
its
own
affair
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
at
least
a
score
of
window
in
its
high
roof
alone
;
how
many
in
its
grotesque
front
,
I
soon
give
up
count
.
 
<EOS>
the
owner
be
a
shopkeeper
,
by
name
Straudenheim
;
by
trade
---
I
could
not
make
out
what
by
trade
,
for
he
have
forborne
to
write
that
up
,
and
his
shop
be
shut
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
,
as
I
look
at
Straudenheim
's
,
through
the
steadily
fall
rain
,
I
set
him
up
in
business
in
the
goose
-
liver
line
.
<EOS>
but
,
inspection
of
Straudenheim
,
who
become
visible
at
a
window
on
the
second
floor
,
convince
me
that
there
be
something
more
precious
than
liver
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
black
velvet
skull
-
cap
,
and
look
usurious
and
rich
.
 
<EOS>
a
large
-
lipped
,
pear
-
nosed
old
man
,
with
white
hair
,
and
keen
eye
,
though
near
-
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
write
at
a
desk
,
be
Straudenheim
,
and
ever
and
again
leave
off
writing
,
put
his
pen
in
his
mouth
,
and
go
through
action
with
his
right
hand
,
like
a
man
steady
pile
of
cash
.
 
<EOS>
five
-
franc
piece
,
Straudenheim
,
or
golden
Napoleons
?
 
<EOS>
a
jeweller
,
Straudenheim
,
a
dealer
in
money
,
a
diamond
merchant
,
or
what
?
   
<EOS>
below
Straudenheim
,
at
a
window
on
the
first
floor
,
sit
his
housekeeper
---
far
from
young
,
but
of
a
comely
presence
,
suggestive
of
a
well
-
mature
foot
and
ankle
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
cheerily
dress
,
have
a
fan
in
her
hand
,
and
wear
large
gold
earring
and
a
large
gold
cross
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
out
holiday
-
making
(
as
I
settle
it
)
but
for
the
pestilent
rain
.
 
<EOS>
Strasbourg
have
give
up
holiday
-
make
for
that
once
,
as
a
bad
job
,
because
the
rain
be
jerk
in
gush
out
of
the
old
roof
-
spout
,
and
run
in
a
brook
down
the
middle
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
,
her
arm
fold
on
her
bosom
and
her
fan
tap
her
chin
,
be
bright
and
smile
at
her
open
window
,
but
otherwise
Straudenheim
's
house
front
be
very
dreary
.
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
's
be
the
only
open
window
in
it
;
Straudenheim
keep
himself
close
,
though
it
be
a
sultry
evening
when
air
be
pleasant
,
and
though
the
rain
have
bring
into
the
town
that
vague
refreshing
smell
of
grass
which
rain
do
bring
in
the
summer
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
the
dim
appearance
of
a
man
at
Straudenheim
's
shoulder
,
inspire
me
with
a
misgiving
that
somebody
have
come
to
murder
that
flourish
merchant
for
the
wealth
with
which
I
have
handsomely
endow
him
:
the
rather
,
as
it
be
an
excited
man
,
lean
and
long
of
figure
,
and
evidently
stealthy
of
foot
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
confer
with
Straudenheim
instead
of
do
him
a
mortal
injury
,
and
then
they
both
softly
open
the
other
window
of
that
room
---
which
be
immediately
over
the
housekeeper
's
---
and
try
to
see
her
by
look
down
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
opinion
of
Straudenheim
be
much
lower
when
I
see
that
eminent
citizen
spit
out
of
window
,
clearly
with
the
hope
of
spit
on
the
housekeeper
.
   
<EOS>
the
unconscious
housekeeper
fan
herself
,
toss
her
head
,
and
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
though
unconscious
of
Straudenheim
,
she
be
conscious
of
somebody
else
---
of
me
?
<EOS>
---
there
be
nobody
else
.
   
<EOS>
after
lean
so
far
out
of
the
window
,
that
I
confidently
expect
to
see
their
heel
tilt
up
,
Straudenheim
and
the
lean
man
draw
their
head
in
and
shut
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
the
house
door
secretly
open
,
and
they
slowly
and
spitefully
creep
forth
into
the
pour
rain
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
come
over
to
me
(
I
think
)
to
demand
satisfaction
for
my
looking
at
the
housekeeper
,
when
they
plunge
into
a
recess
in
the
architecture
under
my
window
and
drag
out
the
puniest
of
little
soldier
,
begirt
with
the
most
innocent
of
little
sword
.
 
<EOS>
the
tall
glaze
head
-
dress
of
this
warrior
<EOS>
,
Straudenheim
instantly
knock
off
,
and
out
of
it
fall
two
sugar
-
stick
,
and
three
or
four
large
lump
of
sugar
.
   
<EOS>
the
warrior
make
no
effort
to
recover
his
property
or
to
pick
up
his
shako
,
but
look
with
an
expression
of
attention
at
Straudenheim
when
he
kick
him
five
time
,
and
also
at
the
lean
man
when
he
kick
him
five
time
,
and
again
at
Straudenheim
when
he
tear
the
breast
of
his
(
the
warrior
's
)
little
coat
open
,
and
shake
all
his
ten
finger
in
his
face
,
as
if
they
be
ten
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
when
these
outrage
have
be
commit
,
Straudenheim
and
his
man
go
into
the
house
again
and
bar
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
a
wonderful
circumstance
be
,
that
the
housekeeper
who
see
it
all
(
and
who
could
have
take
six
such
warrior
to
her
buxom
bosom
at
once
)
,
only
fan
herself
and
laugh
as
she
have
laugh
before
,
and
seem
to
have
no
opinion
about
it
,
one
way
or
other
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
the
chief
effect
of
the
drama
be
the
remarkable
vengeance
take
by
the
little
warrior
.
 
<EOS>
leave
alone
in
the
rain
,
he
pick
up
his
shako
;
put
it
on
,
all
wet
and
dirty
as
it
be
;
retire
into
a
court
,
of
which
Straudenheim
's
house
form
the
corner
;
wheel
about
;
and
bring
his
two
forefinger
close
to
the
top
of
his
nose
,
rub
them
over
one
another
,
cross
-
wise
,
in
derision
,
defiance
,
and
contempt
of
Straudenheim
.
 
<EOS>
although
Straudenheim
could
not
possibly
be
suppose
to
be
conscious
of
this
strange
proceeding
,
it
so
inflate
and
comfort
the
little
warrior
's
soul
,
that
twice
he
go
away
,
and
twice
come
back
into
the
court
to
repeat
it
,
as
though
it
must
goad
his
enemy
to
madness
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
that
,
but
he
afterwards
come
back
with
two
other
small
warrior
,
and
they
all
three
do
it
together
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
that
---
as
I
live
to
tell
the
tale
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
just
as
it
be
fall
quite
dark
,
the
three
come
back
,
bring
with
them
a
huge
bearded
Sapper
,
whom
they
move
,
by
recital
of
the
original
wrong
,
to
go
through
the
same
performance
,
with
the
same
complete
absence
of
all
possible
knowledge
of
it
on
the
part
of
Straudenheim
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
they
all
go
away
,
arm
in
arm
,
singing
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
away
too
,
in
the
german
chariot
at
sunrise
,
and
rattle
on
,
day
after
day
,
like
one
in
a
sweet
dream
;
with
so
many
clear
little
bell
on
the
harness
of
the
horse
,
that
the
nursery
rhyme
about
Banbury
Cross
and
the
venerable
lady
who
ride
in
state
there
,
be
always
in
my
ear
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
come
to
the
land
of
wooden
house
,
innocent
cake
,
thin
butter
soup
,
and
spotless
little
inn
bedroom
with
a
family
likeness
to
dairy
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
swiss
marksman
be
for
ever
rifle
-
shooting
at
mark
across
gorge
,
so
exceedingly
near
my
ear
,
that
I
feel
like
a
new
Gesler
in
a
Canton
of
Tells
,
and
go
in
highly
-
deserved
danger
of
my
tyrannical
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
prize
at
these
shooting
,
be
watch
,
smart
handkerchief
,
hat
,
spoon
,
and
(
above
all
)
tea
-
tray
;
and
at
these
contest
I
come
upon
a
more
than
usually
accomplish
and
amiable
countryman
of
my
own
,
who
have
shoot
himself
deaf
in
whole
year
of
competition
,
and
have
win
so
many
tea
-
tray
that
he
go
about
the
country
with
his
carriage
full
of
them
,
like
a
glorify
Cheap
-
Jack
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
mountain
-
country
into
which
I
have
now
travel
,
a
yoke
of
oxen
be
sometimes
hook
on
before
the
post
-
horse
,
and
I
go
lumber
up
,
up
,
up
,
through
mist
and
rain
,
with
the
roar
of
fall
water
for
change
of
music
.
 
<EOS>
of
a
sudden
,
mist
and
rain
would
clear
away
,
and
I
would
come
down
into
picturesque
little
town
with
gleam
spire
and
odd
tower
;
and
would
stroll
afoot
into
market
-
place
in
steep
winding
street
,
where
a
hundred
woman
in
bodice
,
sell
egg
and
honey
,
butter
and
fruit
,
and
suckle
their
child
as
they
sit
by
their
clean
basket
,
and
have
such
enormous
goitre
(
or
glandular
swelling
in
the
throat
)
that
it
become
a
science
to
know
where
the
nurse
end
and
the
child
begin
.
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
I
desert
my
german
chariot
for
the
back
of
a
mule
(
in
colour
and
consistency
so
very
like
a
dusty
old
hair
trunk
I
once
have
at
school
,
that
I
half
expect
to
see
my
initial
in
brass
-
head
nail
on
his
backbone
)
,
and
go
up
a
thousand
rugged
way
,
and
look
down
at
a
thousand
wood
of
fir
and
pine
,
and
would
on
the
whole
have
prefer
my
mule
's
keep
a
little
nearer
to
the
inside
,
and
not
usually
travel
with
a
hoof
or
two
over
the
precipice
---
though
much
console
by
explanation
that
this
be
to
be
attribute
to
his
great
sagacity
,
by
reason
of
his
carry
broad
load
of
wood
at
other
time
,
and
not
be
clear
but
that
I
myself
belong
to
that
station
of
life
,
and
require
as
much
room
as
they
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
me
safely
,
in
his
own
wise
way
,
among
the
pass
of
the
Alps
,
and
here
I
enjoy
a
dozen
climate
a
day
;
be
now
(
like
Don
Quixote
on
the
back
of
the
wooden
horse
)
in
the
region
of
wind
,
now
in
the
region
of
fire
,
now
in
the
region
of
unmelte
ice
and
snow
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
I
pass
over
tremble
dome
of
ice
,
beneath
which
the
cataract
be
roar
;
and
here
be
receive
under
arch
of
icicle
,
of
unspeakable
beauty
;
and
here
the
sweet
air
be
so
brace
and
so
light
,
that
at
halting
-
time
I
roll
in
the
snow
when
I
see
my
mule
do
it
,
think
that
he
must
know
best
.
<EOS>
at
this
part
of
the
journey
we
would
come
,
at
mid
-
day
,
into
half
an
hour
's
thaw
:
 
when
the
rough
mountain
inn
would
be
find
on
an
island
of
deep
mud
in
a
sea
of
snow
,
while
the
bait
string
of
mule
,
and
the
cart
full
of
cask
and
bale
,
which
have
be
in
an
arctic
condition
a
mile
off
,
would
steam
again
.
 
<EOS>
by
such
way
and
mean
,
I
would
come
to
the
cluster
of
chalet
where
I
have
to
turn
out
of
the
track
to
see
the
waterfall
;
and
then
,
utter
a
howl
like
a
young
giant
,
on
espy
a
traveller
---
in
other
word
,
something
to
eat
---
come
up
the
steep
,
the
idiot
lie
on
the
wood
-
pile
who
sun
himself
and
nurse
his
goitre
,
would
rouse
the
woman
-
guide
within
the
hut
,
who
would
stream
out
hastily
,
throw
her
child
over
one
of
her
shoulder
and
her
goitre
over
the
other
,
as
she
come
along
.
 
<EOS>
I
sleep
at
religious
house
,
and
bleak
refuge
of
many
kind
,
on
this
journey
,
and
by
the
stove
at
night
hear
story
of
traveller
who
have
perish
within
call
,
in
wreath
and
drift
of
snow
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
the
stove
within
,
and
the
cold
outside
,
awaken
childish
association
long
forget
,
and
I
dream
I
be
in
Russia
---
<EOS>
the
identical
serf
out
of
a
picture
-
book
I
have
,
before
I
could
read
it
for
myself
---
and
that
I
be
go
to
be
knoute
by
a
noble
personage
in
a
fur
cap
,
boot
,
and
earring
,
who
,
I
think
,
must
have
come
out
of
some
melodrama
.
   
<EOS>
commend
me
to
the
beautiful
water
among
these
mountain
!
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
not
of
their
mind
:
 
<EOS>
they
,
be
inveterately
bent
on
get
down
into
the
level
country
,
and
I
ardently
desire
to
linger
where
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
what
desperate
leap
they
take
,
what
dark
abyss
they
plunge
into
,
what
rock
they
wear
away
,
what
echo
they
invoke
!
 
<EOS>
in
one
part
where
I
go
,
they
be
press
into
the
service
of
carry
wood
down
,
to
be
burn
next
winter
,
as
costly
fuel
,
in
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
their
fierce
savage
nature
be
not
to
be
easily
constrain
,
and
they
fight
with
every
limb
of
the
wood
;
whirl
it
round
and
round
,
strip
its
bark
away
,
dash
it
against
pointed
corner
,
drive
it
out
of
the
course
,
and
roar
and
fly
at
the
peasant
who
steer
it
back
again
from
the
bank
with
long
stout
pole
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
concurrent
stream
of
time
and
water
carry
me
down
fast
,
and
I
come
,
on
an
exquisitely
clear
day
,
to
the
Lausanne
shore
of
the
Lake
of
Geneva
,
where
I
stand
look
at
the
bright
blue
water
,
the
flushed
white
mountain
opposite
,
and
the
boat
at
my
foot
with
their
furl
Mediterranean
sail
,
show
like
enormous
magnification
of
this
goose
-
quill
pen
that
be
now
in
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
---
the
sky
become
overcast
without
any
notice
;
a
wind
very
like
the
March
east
wind
of
England
,
blow
across
me
;
and
a
voice
say
,
"
how
do
you
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
Will
it
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
merely
shut
myself
,
for
half
a
minute
,
in
a
german
travel
chariot
that
stand
for
sale
in
the
Carriage
Department
of
the
London
Pantechnicon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
commission
to
buy
it
,
for
a
friend
who
be
go
abroad
;
and
the
look
and
manner
of
the
chariot
,
as
I
try
the
cushion
and
the
spring
,
bring
all
these
hint
of
travel
remembrance
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
do
very
well
,
"
say
I
,
rather
sorrowfully
,
as
I
get
out
at
the
other
door
,
and
shut
the
carriage
up
.
    
<EOS>
Number
7
:
<EOS>
the
Great
Tasmania
's
cargo
 
<EOS>
I
travel
constantly
,
up
and
down
a
certain
line
of
railway
that
have
a
terminus
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
railway
for
a
large
military
depot
,
and
for
other
large
barrack
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
my
serious
belief
,
I
have
never
be
on
that
railway
by
daylight
,
without
see
some
handcuff
deserter
in
the
train
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
nature
of
thing
that
such
an
institution
as
our
english
army
should
have
many
bad
and
troublesome
character
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
be
a
reason
for
,
and
not
against
,
its
be
make
as
acceptable
as
possible
to
well
-
dispose
man
of
decent
behaviour
.
<EOS>
such
man
be
assuredly
not
tempt
into
the
rank
,
by
the
beastly
inversion
of
natural
law
,
and
the
compulsion
to
live
in
bad
than
swinish
foulness
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
any
such
circumlocutional
embellishment
of
the
soldier
's
condition
have
of
late
be
bring
to
notice
,
we
civilian
,
seat
in
outer
darkness
cheerfully
meditate
on
an
Income
Tax
,
have
consider
the
matter
as
be
our
business
,
and
have
show
a
tendency
to
declare
that
we
would
rather
not
have
it
misregulate
,
if
such
declaration
may
,
without
violence
to
the
Church
Catechism
,
be
hint
to
those
who
be
put
in
authority
over
us
.
   
<EOS>
any
animate
description
of
a
modern
battle
,
any
private
soldier
's
letter
publish
in
the
newspaper
,
any
page
of
the
record
of
the
Victoria
Cross
,
will
show
that
in
the
rank
of
the
army
,
there
exist
under
all
disadvantage
as
fine
a
sense
of
duty
as
be
to
be
find
in
any
station
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
who
doubt
that
if
we
all
do
our
duty
as
faithfully
as
the
soldier
do
his
,
this
world
would
be
a
well
place
?
 
<EOS>
there
may
be
great
difficulty
in
our
way
than
in
the
soldier
's
.
 
<EOS>
not
dispute
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
let
us
at
least
do
our
duty
towards
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
get
back
again
to
that
rich
and
beautiful
port
where
I
have
look
after
Mercantile
Jack
,
and
I
be
walk
up
a
hill
there
,
on
a
wild
March
morning
.
 
<EOS>
My
conversation
with
my
official
friend
Pangloss
,
by
whom
I
be
accidentally
accompany
,
take
this
direction
as
we
take
the
up
-
hill
direction
,
because
the
object
of
my
uncommercial
journey
be
to
see
some
discharge
soldier
who
have
recently
come
home
from
India
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
man
of
HAVELOCK
's
among
them
;
there
be
man
who
have
be
in
many
of
the
great
battle
of
the
great
indian
campaign
,
among
them
;
and
I
be
curious
to
note
what
our
discharge
soldier
look
like
,
when
they
be
do
with
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
less
interested
(
as
I
mention
to
my
official
friend
Pangloss
)
because
these
man
have
claim
to
be
discharge
,
when
their
right
to
be
discharge
be
not
admit
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
behave
with
unblemished
fidelity
and
bravery
;
but
,
a
change
of
circumstance
have
arise
,
which
,
as
they
consider
,
put
an
end
to
their
compact
and
entitle
them
to
enter
on
a
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
Their
demand
have
be
blunderingly
resist
by
the
authority
in
India
:
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
to
be
presume
that
the
man
be
not
far
wrong
,
inasmuch
as
the
bungle
have
end
in
their
be
send
home
discharge
,
in
pursuance
of
order
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
(
there
be
an
immense
waste
of
money
,
of
course
.
)
   
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
---
think
I
,
as
I
walk
up
the
hill
,
on
which
I
accidentally
encounter
my
official
friend
---
under
these
circumstance
of
the
man
have
successfully
oppose
themselves
to
the
Pagoda
Department
of
that
great
Circumlocution
Office
on
which
the
sun
never
set
and
the
light
of
reason
never
rise
,
the
Pagoda
Department
will
have
be
particularly
careful
of
the
national
honour
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
have
show
these
man
,
in
the
scrupulous
good
faith
,
not
to
say
the
generosity
,
of
its
dealing
with
them
,
that
great
national
authority
can
have
no
small
retaliation
and
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
have
make
every
provision
for
their
health
on
the
passage
home
,
and
will
have
land
them
,
restore
from
their
campaigning
fatigue
by
a
sea
-
voyage
,
pure
air
,
sound
food
,
and
good
medicine
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
please
myself
with
dwell
beforehand
,
on
the
great
account
of
their
personal
treatment
which
these
man
would
carry
into
their
various
town
and
village
,
and
on
the
increase
popularity
of
the
service
that
would
insensibly
follow
.
<EOS>
I
almost
begin
to
hope
that
the
hitherto
-
never
-
fail
deserter
on
my
railroad
would
by
-
and
-
by
become
a
phenomenon
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
agreeable
frame
of
mind
I
enter
the
workhouse
of
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
---
for
,
the
cultivation
of
laurel
in
a
sandy
soil
,
have
bring
the
soldier
in
question
to
that
abode
of
Glory
.
   
<EOS>
before
go
into
their
ward
to
visit
them
,
I
inquire
how
they
have
make
their
triumphant
entry
there
?
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
bring
through
the
rain
in
cart
it
seem
,
from
the
landing
-
place
to
the
gate
,
and
have
then
be
carry
up
-
stair
on
the
back
of
pauper
.
<EOS>
Their
groan
and
pain
during
the
performance
of
this
glorious
pageant
,
have
be
so
distressing
,
as
to
bring
tear
into
the
eye
of
spectator
but
too
well
accustomed
to
scene
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
so
dreadfully
cold
,
that
those
who
could
get
near
the
fire
be
hard
to
be
restrain
from
thrust
their
foot
in
among
the
blaze
coal
.

come
up

this

I

an

the
effort

subdue

be
quite
heroic

It

to

in

I

I
could
have
recognise
in

dress
himself

with
the
intention

sit
by
the
fire

but
he
have
find
himself
too
weak
,
and
have
creep
back
to
his
bed
and
lay
himself
down
on
the
outside
of
it

<EOS>
I
could
have
pronounce
him
,
alone
,
to
be
a
young
man
age
by
famine
and
sickness
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
stand
by
the
irish
soldier

I
mention
my
perplexity
to
the
Doctor

<EOS>
He
take
a
board
with
an
inscription
on
it
from
the
head
of
the
Irishman
's
bed

ask
me
what
age
I
suppose
that
man
to
be

observe
him
with
attention

talk
to
him

answer

confidently
,
"
fifty

"
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
with
a
pity
glance
at
the
patient

who
have
drop
into
a
stupor
again
,
put
the
board
back
,
and
say
,
"
twenty
-
four
.
"
   
<EOS>
all
the
arrangement
of
the
ward
be
excellent

<EOS>
They
could
not
have
be
more
humane
,
sympathising
,
gentle
,
attentive
,
or
wholesome
.
 
<EOS>
the
owner
of
the
ship
,
too
,
have
do
all
they
could
,
liberally
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
bright
fire
in
every
room
,
and
the
convalescent
man
be
sit
round
them
,
read
various
paper
and
periodical
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
of
invite
my
official
friend
Pangloss
to
look
at
those
convalescent
man
,
and
to
tell
me
whether
their
face
and
bearing
be
or
be
not
,
generally
,
the
face
and
bearing
of
steady
respectable
soldier
?
 
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
workhouse
,
overhear
me
,
say
he
have
have
a
pretty
large
experience
of
troop
,
and
that
better
conduct
man
than
these
,
he
have
never
have
to
do
with
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
always
(
he
add
)
as
we
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
of
us
visitor
(
I
add
)
they
know
nothing
whatever
,
except
that
we
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
audacious
in
me
,
but
I
take
another
liberty
with
Pangloss
.
<EOS>
preface
it
with
the
observation
that
,
of
course
,
I
know
beforehand
that
there
be
not
the
faint
desire
,
anywhere
,
to
hush
up
any
part
of
this
dreadful
business
,
and
that
the
Inquest
be
the
fair
of
all
possible
inquest
,
I
besought
four
thing
of
Pangloss
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
to
observe
that
the
Inquest
be
not
hold
in
that
PLACE
,
but
at
some
distance
off
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
to
look
round
upon
those
helpless
spectre
in
their
bed
.
 
<EOS>
thirdly
,
to
remember
that
the
witness
produce
from
among
them
before
that
Inquest
,
could
not
have
be
select
because
they
be
the
man
who
have
the
most
to
tell
it
,
but
because
they
happen
to
be
in
a
state
admit
of
their
safe
removal
.
 
<EOS>
fourthly
,
to
say
whether
the
coroner
and
jury
could
have
come
there
,
to
those
pillow
,
and
take
a
little
evidence
?
 
<EOS>
My
official
friend
decline
to
commit
himself
to
a
reply
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
sergeant
,
read
,
in
one
of
the
fireside
group
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
a
man
of
very
intelligent
countenance
,
and
as
I
have
a
great
respect
for
non
-
commission
officer
as
a
class
,
I
sit
down
on
the
near
bed
,
to
have
some
talk
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
(
It
be
the
bed
of
one
of
the
grisly
of
the
poor
skeleton
,
and
he
die
soon
afterwards
.
)
   
<EOS>

I

ask
Pangloss

<EOS>
My
official

reply
that
it
be
a
remarkable
fact
,
that
whereas
some
officer
be
only
positively
good
,
and
other

only
comparatively
better

those

be
superlatively
the

<EOS>
My
hand
and
my
heart
fail
me
,
in
write
my
record
of
this
journey

<EOS>
the
spectacle
of
the
soldier
in
the
hospital
-
bed
of
that
Liverpool
workhouse
(
a
very
good
workhouse
,
indeed
,
be
it
understand
)
,
be
so
shocking
and
so
shameful
,
that
as
an
Englishman
I
blush
to
remember
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
simply
unbearable
at
the
time
,
but
for
the
consideration
and
pity
with
which
they
be
soothe
in
their
suffering
.
   
<EOS>
no
punishment
that
our
inefficient
law
provide
,
be
worthy
of

when
set
against
the
guilt

this
transaction

<EOS>
but
,
if
the
memory
of
it
die
out
unavenged
,
and
if
it
do
not
result
in
the
inexorable
dismissal
and
disgrace
of
those
who
be

it

their
escape
will
be
infamous
to
the
Government

(
no

that
so
neglect
its

infamous

my

of
a
female
hand
by
the
crown
,
have
be
violently
scrub
from
the
neck
to
the
root
of
the

as
a
purification
for
the

,
and
have
then
be
carry
off
highly
charge
with
saponaceous
electricity
,
to
be
steam
like
a
potato
in
the
unventilated
breath
of
the
powerful
Boanerges
Boiler
and
his
congregation
,
until
what
small
mind
I
have
,
be
quite
steamed
out
of
me

<EOS>
in
which
pitiable
plight
I
have
be
hale
out

of
meeting

at
the
conclusion
of
the

,
and
catechise
respect
Boanerges
Boiler
,
his
fifthly
,
his
sixthly
,
and
his
seventhly
,
until
I
have
regard
that
reverend
person
in
the
light
of
a
most
dismal
and
oppressive
Charade
.
 
<EOS>
Time
be
,
when
I
be
carry
off
to
platform
assemblage
at
which
no
human
child
,
whether
of
wrath
or
grace
,
could
possibly
keep
its
eye
open
,
and
when
I
feel
the
fatal
sleep
steal
,
steal
over
me
,
and
when
I
gradually
hear
the
orator
in
possession
,
spinning
and
hum
like
a
great
top
,
until
he
roll
,
collapse
,
and
tumble
over
,
and
I
discover
to
my
burn
shame
and
fear
,
that
as
to
that
last
stage
it
be
not
he
,
but
I.
 
I
have
sit
under
Boanerges
when
he
have
specifically
address
himself
to
us
---
us
,
the
infant
---
and
at
this
present
writing
I
hear
his
lumber
jocularity
(
which
never
amuse
us
,
though
we
basely
pretend
that
it
do
)
,
and
I
behold
his
big
round
face
,
and
I
look
up
the
inside
of
his
outstretche
coat
-
sleeve
as
if
it
be
a
telescope
with
the
stopper
on
,
and
I
hate
him
with
an
unwholesome
hatred
for
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
through
such
mean
do
it
come
to
pass
that
I
know
the
powerful
preacher
from
begin
to
end
,
all
over
and
all
through
,
while
I
be
very
young

that
I
leave
him

early
period
of

<EOS>
peace
be
with
him
!
 
<EOS>
More
peace
than
he
bring
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
hear
many
preacher
since
that
time
---
not
powerful
;
merely
christian
,
unaffected
,
and
reverential
---
and
I
have
have
many
such
preacher
on
my
roll
of
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
not
to
hear
these
,
any
more
than
the
powerful
class
,
that
I
make
my
Sunday
journey
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
journey
of
curiosity
to
the
numerous
church
in
the
City
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
into
my
head
one
day
,
here
have
I
be
cultivate
a
familiarity
with
all
the
church
of
Rome
,
and
I
know
nothing
of
the
inside
of
the
old
church
of
London
!
 
<EOS>
this
befell
on
a
Sunday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
my
expedition
that
very
same
day
,
and
they
last
me
a
year
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
want
to
know
the
name
of
the
church
to
which
I
go
,
and
to
this
hour
I
be
profoundly
ignorant
in
that
particular
of
at
least
nine
-
tenth
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
say
that
I
know
the
church
of
old
GOWER
's
tomb
<EOS>
(
he
lie
in
effigy
with
his
head
upon
his
book
)
to
be
the
church
of
Saint
Saviour
's
,
southwark
;
and
the
church
of
MILTON
's
tomb
to
be
the
church
of
Cripplegate
;
and
the
church
on
Cornhill
with
the
great
golden
key
to
be
the
church
of
Saint
Peter
<EOS>
;
I
doubt
if
I
could
pass
a
competitive
examination
in
any
of
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
no
question
<EOS>
do
I
ever
ask
of
live
creature
concern
these
church
,
and
no
answer
to
any
antiquarian
question
on
the
subject
that
I
ever
put
to
book
,
<EOS>
shall
harass
the
reader
's
soul
.
 
<EOS>
a
full
half
of
my
pleasure
in
them
arise
out
of
their
mystery
;
mysterious
I
find
them
;
mysterious
they
shall
remain
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
where
shall
I
begin
my
round
of
hide
and
forget
old
church
in
the
City
of
London
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
twenty
minute
short
of
eleven
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
stroll
down
one
of
the
many
narrow
hilly
street
in
the
City
that
tend
due
south
to
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
first
experiment
,
and
I
have
come
to
the
region
of
Whittington
in
an
omnibus
,
and
we
have
put
down
a
fierce
-
eyed
,
spare
old
woman
,
whose
slate
-
colour
gown
smell
of
herb
,
and
who
walk
up
Aldersgate
-
street
to
some
chapel
where
she
comfort
herself
with
brimstone
doctrine
,
I
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
also
put
down
a
stouter
and
sweet
old
lady
,
with
a
pretty
large
prayer
-
book
in
an
unfolded
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
who
get
out
at
a
corner
of
a
court
near
Stationers
'
Hall
,
and
who
I
think
must
go
to
church
there
,
because
she
be
the
widow
of
some
deceased
old
Company
's
Beadle
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
our
freight
be
mere
chance
pleasure
-
seeker
and
rural
walker
,
and
go
on
to
the
Blackwall
railway
.
 
<EOS>
so
many
bell
be
ring
,
when
I
stand
undecided
at
a
street
corner
,
that
every
sheep
in
the
ecclesiastical
fold
may
be
a
bell
-
wether
.
 
<EOS>
the
discordance
be
fearful
.
 
<EOS>
My
state
of
indecision
be
referable
to
,
and
about
equally
divisible
among
,
four
great
church
,
which
be
all
within
sight
and
sound
,
all
within
the
space
of
a
few
square
yard
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
stand
at
the
street
corner
,
I
do
not
see
as
many
as
four
people
at
once
go
to
church
,
though
I
see
as
many
as
four
church
with
their
steeple
clamour
for
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
choose
my
church
,
and
go
up
the
flight
of
step
to
the
great
entrance
in
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
a
mouldy
tower
within
,
and
like
a
neglect
washhouse
.
 
<EOS>
a
rope
come
through
the
beam
roof
,
and
a
man
in
the
corner
pull
it
and
clash
the
bell
---
a
whity
-
brown
man
,
whose
clothe
be
once
black
---
a
man
with
flue
on
him
,
and
cobweb
.
 
<EOS>
He
stare
at
me
,
wonder
how
I
come
there
,
and
I
stare
at
him
,
wonder
how
he
come
there
.
<EOS>
through
a
screen
of
wood
and
glass
,
I
peep
into
the
dim
church
.
<EOS>
about
twenty
people
be
discernible
,
wait
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
Christening
would
seem
to
have
fade
out
of
this
church
long
ago
,
for
the
font
have
the
dust
of
desuetude
thick
upon
it
,
and
its
wooden
cover
(
shape
like
an
old
-
fashioned
tureen
-
cover
)
look
as
if
it
would
not
come
off
,
upon
requirement
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceive
the
altar
to
be
rickety
and
the
Commandments
damp
.
 
<EOS>
enter
after
this
survey
,
I
jostle
the
clergyman
in
his
canonical
,
who
be
enter
too
from
a
dark
lane
behind
a
pew
of
state
with
curtain
,
where
nobody
sit
.
 
<EOS>
the
pew
be
ornament
with
four
blue
wand

once
carry
by
four
somebodys
,
I
suppose
,
before
somebody
else
,
but
which
there
be
nobody
now
to
hold
or
receive
honour
from
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
of
a
family
pew
,
and
shut
myself
in
;
if
I
could
occupy
twenty
family
pew
at
once
I
may
have
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
,
a
brisk
young
man
(
how
do
he
come
here
?
)
,
glance
at
me
knowingly

as
who
should

"

there
be
a
pale
heap
of
book
in
the
corner
of
my
pew
,
and
while
the
organ
,
which
be
hoarse
and
sleepy
,
play
in
such
fashion
that
I
can
hear
more
of
the
rusty
working
of
the
stop
than
of
any
music
,
I
look
at
the
book
,
which
be
mostly
bind
in
fade
baize
and
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
They
belong
in
1754
,
to
the
Dowgate
family
;
and
who
be
they
?
 
<EOS>
Jane
Comport
must
have
marry
Young
Dowgate
,
and
come
into
the
family
that
way
;
Young
Dowgate
be
court
Jane
Comport
when
he
give
her
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
record
the
presentation
in
the
fly
-
leaf
;
if
Jane
be
fond
of
Young
Dowgate
,
why
do
she
die
and
leave
the
book
here
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
at
the
rickety
altar
,
and
before
the
damp
Commandments
,
she
,
Comport
,
have
take
him
,
Dowgate
,
in
a
flush
of
youthful
hope
and
joy
,
and
perhaps
it
have
not
turn
out
in
the
long
run
as
great
a
success
as
be
expect
?
   
<EOS>
the
opening
of
the
service
recall
my
wander
thought
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
find
,
to
my
astonishment
,
that
I
have
be
,
and
still
am
,
take
a
strong
kind
of
invisible
snuff
,
up
my
nose
,
into
my
eye
,
and
down
my
throat
.
 
<EOS>
I
wink
,
sneeze
,
and
cough
.
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
sneeze
;
the
clergyman
winks
;
the
unseen
organist
sneeze
and
cough
(
and
probably
winks
)
;
all
our
little
party
wink
,
sneeze
,
and
cough
.
 
<EOS>
the
snuff
seem
to
be
make
of
the
decay
of
matting
,
wood
,
cloth
,
stone
,
iron
,
earth
,
and
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
be
the
something
else
,
the
decay
of
dead
citizen
in
the
vault
below
?
 
<EOS>
as
sure
as
death
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
not
only
in
the
cold
,
damp
February
day
,
do
we
cough
and
sneeze
dead
citizen
,
all
through
the
service
,
but
dead
citizen
have
get
into
the
very
bellow
of
the
organ
,
and
half
choke
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
We
stamp
our
foot
to
warm
them
,
and
dead
citizen
arise
in
heavy
cloud
.
<EOS>
dead
citizen
stick
upon
the
wall
,
and
lie
pulverise
on
the
sounding
-
board
over
the
clergyman
's
head
,
and
,
when
a
gust
of
air
come
,
tumble
down
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
first
experience
I
be
so
nauseate
by
too
much
snuff
,
make
of
the
Dowgate
family
,
the
Comport
branch
,
and
other
family
and
branch
,
that
I
give
but
little
heed
to
our
dull
manner
of
amble
through
the
service
;
to
the
brisk
clerk
's
manner
of
encourage
us
to
try
a
note
or
two
at
psalm
time
;
to
the
gallery
-
congregation
's
manner
of
enjoy
a
shrill
duet
,
without
a
notion
of
time
or
tune
;
to
the
whity
-
brown
man
's
manner
of
shut
the
minister
into
the
pulpit
,
and
be
very
particular
with
the
lock
of
the
door
,
as
if
he
be
a
dangerous
animal
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
try
again
next
Sunday
,
and
soon
accustom
myself
to
the
dead
citizen
when
I
find
that
I
could
not
possibly
get
on
without
them
among
the
City
church
.
   
<EOS>
another
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
after
be
again
ring
for
by
conflict
bell
,
like
a
leg
of
mutton
or
a
laced
hat
<EOS>
a
hundred
year
ago
,
I
make
selection
of
a
church
oddly
put
away
in
a
corner
among
a
number
of
lane
---
a
small
church
than
the
last
,
and
an
ugly
:
 
of
about
the
date
of
Queen
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
congregation
,
we
be
fourteen
strong
:
 
not
count
an
exhausted
charity
school
in
a
gallery
,
which
have
dwindle
away
to
four
boy
,
and
two
girl
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
porch
,
be
a
benefaction
of
loaf
of
bread
,
which
there
would
seem
to
be
nobody
leave
in
the
exhausted
congregation
to
claim
,
and
which
I
see
an
exhausted
beadle
,
long
fade
out
of
uniform
,
eat
with
his
eye
for
self
and
family
when
I
pass
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
exhausted
clerk
in
a
brown
wig
,
and
two
or
three
exhausted
door
and
window
have
be
bricke
up
,
and
the
service
book
be
musty
,
and
the
pulpit
cushion
be
threadbare
,
and
the
whole
of
the
church
furniture
be
in
a
very
advanced
stage
of
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
three
old
woman
(
habitual
)
,
two
young
lover
(
accidental
)
,
two
tradesman
,
one
with
a
wife
and
one
alone
,
an
aunt
and
nephew
,
again
two
girl
(
these
two
girl
dress
out
for
church
with
everything
about
them
limp
that
should
be
stiff
,
and
VICE
VERSA
,
be
an
invariable
experience
)
,
and
three
snigger
boy
.
 
<EOS>
the
clergyman
be
,
perhaps
,
the
chaplain
of
a
civic
company
;
he
have
the
moist
and
vinous
look
,
and
eke
the
bulbous
boot
,
of
one
acquaint
with
"
twenty
port
,
and
comet
vintage
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
so
quiet
in
our
dulness
that
the
three
snigger
boy
,
who
have
get
away
into
a
corner
by
the
altar
-
rail
,
give
us
a
start
,
like
cracker
,
whenever
they
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
remind
me
of
my
own
village
church
where
,
during
sermon
-
time
on
bright
sunday
when
the
bird
be
very
musical
indeed
,
farmer
'
boy
patter
out
over
the
stone
pavement
,
and
the
clerk
step
out
from
his
desk
after
them
,
and
be
distinctly
hear
in
the
summer
repose
to
pursue
and
punch
them
in
the
churchyard
,
and
be
see
to
return
with
a
meditative
countenance
,
make
believe
that
nothing
of
the
sort
have
happen
.
<EOS>
the
aunt
and
nephew
in
this
City
church
be
much
disturb
by
the
snigger
boy
.
 
<EOS>
the
nephew
be
himself
a
boy
,
and
the
sniggerer
tempt
him
to
secular
thought
of
marble
and
string
,
by
secretly
offer
such
commodity
to
his
distant
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
this
young
Saint
Anthony
for
a
while
resist
,
but
presently
become
a
backslider
,
and
in
dumb
show
defy
the
sniggerer
to
"
heave
"
a
marble
or
two
in
his
direction
.
 
<EOS>
here
in
he
be
detect
by
the
aunt
(
a
rigorous
reduce
gentlewoman
who
have
the
charge
of
office
)
,
and
I
perceive
that
worthy
relative
to
poke
him
in
the
side
,
with
the
corrugate
hooked
handle
of
an
ancient
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
the
nephew
revenge
himself
for
this
,
by
hold
his
breath
and
terrify
his
kinswoman
with
the
dread
belief
that
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
burst
.
 
<EOS>
regardless
of
whisper
and
shake
,
he
swell
and
become
discolour
,
and
yet
again
swell
and
become
discolour
,
<EOS>
until
the
aunt
can
bear
it
no
longer
,
but
lead
him
out
,
with
no
visible
neck
,
and
with
his
eye
go
before
him
like
a
prawn
's
.
 
<EOS>
this
cause
the
sniggerer
to
regard
flight
as
an
eligible
move
,
and
I
know
which
of
them
will
go
out
first
,
because
of
the
over
-
devout
attention
that
he
suddenly
concentrate
on
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
while
,
this
hypocrite
,
with
an
elaborate
demonstration
of
hush
his
footstep
,
and
with
a
face
generally
expressive
of
have
until
now
forget
a
religious
appointment
elsewhere
,
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
number
two
get
out
in
the
same
way
,
but
rather
quicker
.
<EOS>
number
three
get
safely
to
the
door
,
there
turn
reckless
,
and
bang
it
open
,
fly
forth
with
a
Whoop
!
<EOS>
that
vibrate
to
the
top
of
the
tower
above
us
.
   
<EOS>
the
clergyman
,
who
be
of
a
prandial
presence
and
a
muffled
voice
,
may
be
scant
of
hear
as
well
as
of
breath
,
but
he
only
glance
up
,
as
have
an
idea
that
somebody
have
say
amen
in
a
wrong
place
,
and
continue
his
steady
jog
-
trot
,
like
a
farmer
's
wife
go
to
market
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
all
he
have
to
do
,
in
the
same
easy
way
,
and
give
us
a
concise
sermon
,
still
like
the
jog
-
trot
of
the
farmer
's
wife
on
a
level
road
.
 
<EOS>
Its
drowsy
cadence
soon
lull
the
three
old
woman
asleep
,
and
the
unmarried
tradesman
sit
look
out
at
window
,
and
the
married
tradesman
sit
look
at
his
wife
's
bonnet
,
and
the
lover
sit
look
at
one
another
,
so
superlatively
happy
,
<EOS>
that
I
mind
when
I
,
turn
of
eighteen
,
go
with
my
Angelica
to
a
City
church
on
account
of
a
shower
(
by
this
special
coincidence
that
it
be
in
Huggin
-
lane
)
,
and
when
I
say
to
my
Angelica
,
"
let
the
blessed
event
,
Angelica
,
occur
at
no
altar
but
this
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
when
my
Angelica
consent
that
it
should
occur
at
no
other
---
which
it
certainly
never
do
,
for
it
never
occur
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
and
o
,
Angelica
,
what
have
become
of
you
,
this
present
Sunday
morning
when
I
can
not
attend
to
the
sermon
;
and
,
more
difficult
question
than
that
<EOS>
,
what
have
become
of
Me
as
I
be
when
I
sit
by
your
side
!
   
<EOS>
but
,
we
receive
the
signal
to
make
that
unanimous
dive
which
surely
be
a
little
conventional
---
like
the
strange
rustling
and
settling
and
clearing
of
throat
and
nose
,
which
be
never
dispense
with
,
at
certain
point
of
the
Church
service
,
and
be
never
hold
to
be
necessary
under
any
other
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
minute
more
it
be
all
over
,
and
the
organ
express
itself
to
be
as
glad
of
it
as
it
can
be
of
anything
in
its
rheumatic
state
,
and
in
another
minute
we
be
all
of
us
out
of
the
church
,
and
Whity
-
brown
have
lock
it
up
.
<EOS>
another
minute
or
little
more
,
and
,
in
the
neighbouring
churchyard
---
not
the
yard
of
that
church
,
but
of
another
---
a
churchyard
like
a
great
shabby
old
mignonette
box
,
with
two
tree
in
it
and
one
tomb
<EOS>
---
I
meet
Whity
-
brown
,
in
his
private
capacity
,
fetch
a
pint
of
beer
for
his
dinner
from
the
public
-
house
in
the
corner
,
where
the
key
of
the
rot
fire
-
ladder
be
keep
and
be
never
ask
for
,
and
where
there
be
a
ragged
,
white
-
seam
,
out
-
at
-
elbow
bagatelle
board
on
the
first
floor
.
   
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
city
church
,
and
only
in
one
,
I
find
an
individual
who
may
have
be
claim
as
expressly
a
City
personage
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
church
,
by
the
feature
that
the
clergyman
could
not
get
to
his
own
desk
without
go
through
the
clerk
's
,
or
could
not
get
to
the
pulpit
without
go
through
the
reading
-
desk
<EOS>
---
I
forget
which
,
and
it
be
no
matter
---
<EOS>
and
by
the
presence
of
this
personage
among
the
exceedingly
sparse
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
we
be
a
dozen
,
and
we
have
no
exhaust
charity
school
to
help
us
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
personage
be
dress
in
black
of
square
cut
,
and
be
stricken
in
year
,
and
wear
a
black
velvet
cap
,
and
cloth
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
a
staid
,
wealthy
,
and
dissatisfied
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
hand
,
he
conduct
to
church
a
mysterious
child
:
 
<EOS>
a
child
of
the
feminine
gender
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
have
a
beaver
hat
,
with
a
stiff
drab
plume
that
surely
never
belong
to
any
bird
of
the
air
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
further
attire
in
a
nankeen
frock
and
spencer
,
brown
boxing
-
glove
,
and
a
veil
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
a
blemish
,
in
the
nature
of
currant
jelly
,
on
its
chin
;
and
be
a
thirsty
child
.
 
<EOS>
Insomuch
that
the
personage
carry
in
his
pocket
a
green
bottle
,
from
which
,
when
the
first
psalm
be
give
out
,
the
child
be
openly
refresh
.
<EOS>
at
all
other
time
throughout
the
service
it
be
motionless
,
and
stand
on
the
seat
of
the
large
pew
,
closely
fit
into
the
corner
,
like
a
rain
-
water
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
the
personage
never
open
his
book
,
and
never
look
at
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
sit
down
either
,
but
stand
with
his
arm
lean
on
the
top
of
the
pew
,
and
his
forehead
sometimes
shade
with
his
right
hand
,
always
look
at
the
church
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
church
for
a
church
of
its
size
,
and
he
be
at
the
upper
end
,
but
he
always
look
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
be
an
old
bookkeeper
,
or
an
old
trader
who
have
keep
his
own
book
,
and
that
he
may
be
see
at
the
Bank
of
England
about
Dividend
time
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
live
in
the
City
all
his
life
and
be
disdainful
of
other
locality
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
why
he
look
at
the
door
,
I
never
absolutely
prove
,
but
it
be
my
belief
that
he
live
in
expectation
of
the
time
when
the
citizen
would
come
back
to
live
in
the
City
,
and
its
ancient
glory
would
be
renew
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
expect
that
this
would
occur
on
a
Sunday
,
and
that
the
wanderer
would
first
appear
,
in
the
desert
church
,
penitent
and
humble
.
<EOS>
hence
,
he
look
at
the
door
which
they
never
darken
.
 
<EOS>
whose
child
the
child
be
,
whether
the
child
of
a
disinherit
daughter
,
or
some
parish
orphan
whom
the
personage
have
adopt
,
there
be
nothing
to
lead
up
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
play
,
or
skip
,
or
smile
.
<EOS>
once
,
the
idea
occur
to
me
that
it
be
an
automaton
,
and
that
the
personage
have
make
it
;
but
follow
the
strange
couple
out
one
Sunday
,
I
hear
the
personage
say
to
it
,
"
thirteen
thousand
pound
;
"
to
which
it
add
in
a
weak
human
voice
,
"
seventeen
and
fourpence
.
"
 
<EOS>
four
Sundays
I
follow
them
out
,
and
this
be
all
I
ever
hear
or
see
them
say
.
 
<EOS>
one
Sunday
,
I
follow
them
home
.
<EOS>
They
live
behind
a
pump
,
and
the
personage
open
their
abode
with
an
exceed
large
key
.
 
<EOS>
the
one
solitary
inscription
on
their
house
relate
to
a
fire
-
plug
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
partly
undermine
by
a
desert
and
closed
gateway
;
its
window

disconsolately

<EOS>
five
great
church
and
two
small
one
ring
their
Sunday
bell
between
this
house
and
the
church
the
couple
frequent
,
so
they
must
have
have
some
special
reason
for
go
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
time
I
see
them
,
be
on
this
wise
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
explore
another
church
at
a
distance
,
and
happen
to
pass
the
church
they
frequent
,
at
about
two
of
the
afternoon
when
that
edifice
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
a
little
side
-
door
,
which
I
have
never
observe
before
,
stand
open
,
and
disclose
certain
cellarous
step
.
<EOS>
Methought
<EOS>
"
They
be
air
the
vault
to
-
day
,
"
when
the
personage
and
the
child
silently
arrive
at
the
step
,
and
silently
descend
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
personage
have
at
last
despair
of
the
look
-
for
return
of
the
penitent
citizen
,
and
that
he
and
the
child
go
down
to
get
themselves
bury
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
pilgrimage
I
come
upon
one
obscure
church
which
have
break
out
in
the
melodramatic
style
,
and
be
get
up
with
various
tawdry
decoration
,
much
after
the
manner
of
the
extinct
London
may
-
pole
.
 
<EOS>
these
attraction
have
induce
several
young
priest
or
deacon
in
black
bibs
for
waistcoat
,
and
several
young
lady
interest
in
that
holy
order
(
the
proportion
be
,
as
I
estimate
,
seventeen
young
lady
to
a
deacon
)
,
to
come
into
the
City
as
a
new
and
odd
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
see
how
these
young
people
play
out
their
little
play
in
the
heart
of
the
City
,
all
among
themselves
,
without
the
desert
City
's
know
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
you
should
take
an
empty
counting
-
house
on
a
Sunday
,
and
act
one
of
the
old
Mysteries
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
impress
a
small
school
(
from
what
neighbourhood
I
do
not
know
)
to
assist
in
the
performance
,
and
it
be
pleasant
to
notice
frantic
garland
of
inscription
on
the
wall
,
especially
address
those
poor
innocent
in
character
impossible
for
them
to
decipher
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
remarkably
agreeable
smell
of
pomatum
in
this
congregation
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
in
other
case
,
rot
and
mildew
and
dead
citizen
form
the
uppermost
scent
,
while
,
infuse
into
it
in
a
dreamy
way
not
at
all
displease
,
be
the
staple
character
of
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
church
about
Mark
-
lane
,
for
example
,
there
be
a
dry
whiff
of
wheat
;
and
I
accidentally
strike
an
airy
sample
of
barley
out
of
an
aged
hassock
in
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
from
Rood
-
lane
to
tower
-
street
,
and
thereabout
,
there
be
often
a
subtle
flavour
of
wine
:
 
sometimes
,
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
one
church
near
mince
-
lane
smelt
like
a
druggist
's
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
behind
the
Monument
the
service
have
a
flavour
of
damaged
orange
,
which
,
a
little
further
down
towards
the
river
,
temper
into
herring
,
and
gradually
tone
into
a
cosmopolitan
blast
of
fish
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
church
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
church
in
the
Rake
's
progress
where
the
hero
be
be
marry
to
the
horrible
old
lady
,
there
be
no
speciality
of
atmosphere
,
until
the
organ
shake
a
perfume
of
hide
all
over
us
from
some
adjacent
warehouse
.
   
<EOS>
be
the
scent
what
it
would
,
however
,
there
be
no
speciality
in
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
never
enough
of
them
to
represent
any
calling
or
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
all
go
elsewhere
over
-
night
,
and
the
few
straggler
in
the
many
church
languish
there
inexpressively
.
   
<EOS>
among
the
uncommercial
travel
in
which
I
have
engage
,
this
year
of
Sunday
travel
occupy
its
own
place
,
apart
from
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
whether
I
think
of
the
church
where
the
sail
of
the
oyster
-
boat
in
the
river
almost
flap
against
the
window
,
or
of
the
church
where
the
railroad
make
the
bell
hum
as
the
train
rush
by
above
the
roof
,
I
recall
a
curious
experience
.
 
<EOS>
on
summer
sunday
,
in
the
gentle
rain
or
the
bright
sunshine
---
either
,
deepen
the
idleness
of
the
idle
City
---
I
have
sit
,
in
that
singular
silence
which
belong
to
rest
-
place
usually
astir
,
in
score
of
building
at
the
heart
of
the
world
's
metropolis
,
unknown
to
far
great
number
of
people
speak
the
english
tongue
,
than
the
ancient
edifice
of
the
Eternal
City
,
or
the
Pyramids
of
Egypt
.
 
<EOS>
the
dark
vestry
and
registry
into
which
I
have
peep
,
and
the
little
hem
-
in
churchyard
that
have
echo
to
my
foot
,
have
leave
impression
on
my
memory
as
distinct
and
quaint
as
any
it
have
in
that
way
receive
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
those
dusty
register
that
the
worm
be
eat
,
there
be
not
a
line
but
make
some
heart
leap
,
or
some
tear
flow
,
in
their
day
.
 
<EOS>
still
and
dry
now
,
still
and
dry
!
<EOS>
and
the
old
tree
at
the
window
with
no
room
for
its
branch
,
have
see
them
all
out
.
<EOS>
so
with
the
tomb
of
the
old
Master
of
the
old
Company
,
on
which
it
drip
.
 
<EOS>
His
son
restore
it
and
die
,
his
daughter
restore
it
and
die
,
and
then
he
have
be
remember
long
enough
,
and
the
tree
take
possession
of
him
,
and
his
name
crack
out
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
few
more
striking
indication
of
the
change
of
manner
and
custom
that
two
or
three
hundred
year
have
bring
about
,
than
these
desert
church
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
them
be
handsome
and
costly
structure
,
several
of
them
be
design
by
WREN
,
many
of
them
arise
from
the
ashe
of
the
great
fire
,
other
of
them
outlive
the
plague
and
the
fire
too
,
to
die
a
slow
death
in
these
later
day
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
be
sure
of
the
coming
time
;
but
it
be
not
too
much
to
say
of
it
that
it
have
no
sign
in
its
outsette
tide
,
of
the
reflux
to
these
church
of
their
congregation
and
use
.
 
<EOS>
They
remain
like
the
tomb
of
the
old
citizen
who
lie
beneath
them
and
around
them
,
monument
of
another
age
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
worth
a
Sunday
-
exploration
,
now
and
then
,
for
they
yet
echo
,
not
unharmoniously
,
to
the
time
when
the
City
of
London
really
be
London
;
when
the
"
Prentices
and
Trained
Bands
be
of
mark
in
the
state
;
when
even
the
Lord
Mayor
himself
be
a
reality

not

conventionally
be

puff
on
one
day
in

illustrious

Number

:
<EOS>
Shy
Neighbourhoods
 
<EOS>
so
much
of
my
travelling
be
do
on
foot
,
that
if
I
cherish
bet
propensity
,
I
should
probably
be
find
registered
in
sport
newspaper
under
some
such
title
as
the
Elastic
Novice
,
challenge
all
eleven
stone
mankind
to
competition
in
walking
.
 
<EOS>
My
last
special
feat
be
turn
out
of
bed
at
two
,
after
a
hard
day
,
pedestrian
and
otherwise
,
and
walk
thirty
mile
into
the
country
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
be
so
lonely
in
the
night
,
that
I
fall
asleep
to
the
monotonous
sound
of
my
own
foot
,
do
their
regular
four
mile
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Mile
after
mile
I
walk
,
without
the
slight
sense
of
exertion
,
doze
heavily
and
dream
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
I
make
a
stumble
like
a
drunken
man
,
or
strike
out
into
the
road
to
avoid
a
horseman
close
upon
me
on
the
path
---
who
have
no
existence
---
that
I
come
to
myself
and
look
about
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
break
mistily
(
it
be
autumn
time
)
,
and
I
could
not
disembarrass
myself
of
the
idea
that
I
have
to
climb
those
height
and
bank
of
cloud
,
and
that
there
be
an
Alpine
Convent
somewhere
behind
the
sun
,
where
I
be
go
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
this
sleepy
notion
be
so
much
strong
than
such
substantial
object
as
village
and
haystack
,
that
,
after
the
sun
be
up
and
bright
,
and
when
I
be
sufficiently
awake
to
have
a
sense
of
pleasure
in
the
prospect
,
I
still
occasionally
catch
myself
look
about
for
wooden
arm
to
point
the
right
track
up
the
mountain
,
and
wonder
there
be
no
snow
yet
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
curiosity
of
broken
sleep
that
I
make
immense
quantity
of
verse
on
that
pedestrian
occasion
(
of
course
I
never
make
any
when
I
be
in
my
right
sense
)
,
and
that
I
speak
a
certain
language
once
pretty
familiar
to
me
,
but
which
I
have
nearly
forget
from
disuse
,
with
fluency
.
 
<EOS>
of
both
these
phenomenon
<EOS>
I
have
such
frequent
experience
in
the
state
between
sleep
and
wake
,
that
I
sometimes
argue
with
myself
that
I
know
I
can
not
be
awake
,
for
,
if
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
be
half
so
ready
.
 
<EOS>
the
readiness
be
not
imaginary
,
because
I
often
recall
long
string
of
the
verse
,
and
many
turn
of
the
fluent
speech
,
after
I
be
broad
awake
.
   
<EOS>
My
walking
be
of
two
kind
:
 
one
,
straight
on
end
to
a
definite
goal
at
a
round
pace
;
one
,
objectless
,
loitering
,
and
purely
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
latter
state
,
no
gipsy
on
earth
be
a
great
vagabond
than
myself
;
it
be
so
natural
to
me
,
and
strong
with
me
,
that
I
think
I
must
be
the
descendant
,
at
no
great
distance
,
of
some
irreclaimable
tramp
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
the
pleasantest
thing
I
have
lately
meet
with
,
in
a
vagabond
course
of
shy
metropolitan
neighbourhood
and
small
shop
,
be
the
fancy
of
a
humble
artist
,
as
exemplify
in
two
portrait
represent
Mr
Thomas
Sayers
,
of
Great
Britain
,
and
Mr
John
Heenan
,
of
the
United
States
of
America
.
 
<EOS>
these
illustrious
man
be
highly
coloured
in
fight
trim
,
and
fight
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
to
suggest
the
pastoral
and
meditative
nature
of
their
peaceful
calling
,
Mr
Heenan
be
represent
on
emerald
sward
,
with
primrose
and
other
modest
flower
spring
up
under
the
heel
of
his
half
-
boot
;
while
Mr
Sayers
be
impel
to
the
administration
of
his
favourite
blow
,
the
Auctioneer
,
by
the
silent
eloquence
of
a
village
church
.
 
<EOS>
the
humble
home
of
England
,
with
their
domestic
virtue
and
honeysuckle
porch
,
urge
both
hero
to
go
in
and
win
;
and
the
lark
and
other
singing
bird
be
observable
in
the
upper
air
,
ecstatically
carol
their
thank
to
Heaven
for
a
fight
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
the
association
entwine
with
the
pugilistic
art
by
this
artist
be
much
in
the
manner
of
Izaak
Walton
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
with
the
low
animal
of
back
street
and
by
-
way
that
my
present
purpose
rest
.
 
<EOS>
for
human
note
we
may
return
to
such
neighbourhood
when
leisure
and
opportunity
serve
.
   
<EOS>
nothing
in
shy
neighbourhood
perplex
my
mind
more
,
than
the
bad
company
bird
keep
.
 
<EOS>
foreign
bird
often
get
into
good
society
,
but
british
bird
be
inseparable
from
low
associate
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
whole
street
of
them
in
St
Giles
's
;
and
I
always
find
them
in
poor
and
immoral
neighbourhood
,
convenient
to
the
public
-
house
and
the
pawnbroker
's
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
lead
people
into
drinking
,
and
even
the
man
who
make
their
cage
usually
get
into
a
chronic
state
of
black
eye
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
also
,
they
will
do
thing
for
people
in
short
-
skirt
velveteen
coat
with
bone
button
,
or
in
sleeve
waistcoat
and
fur
cap
,
which
they
can
not
be
persuade
by
the
respectable
order
of
society
to
undertake
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
dirty
court
in
Spitalfields
,
once
,
I
find
a
goldfinch
draw
his
own
water
,
and
draw
as
much
of
it
as
if
he
be
in
a
consume
fever
.
 
<EOS>
that
goldfinch
live
at
a
bird
-
shop
,
and
offer
,
in
writing
,
to
barter
himself
against
old
clothe
,
empty
bottle
,
or
even
kitchen
stuff
.
<EOS>
surely
a
low
thing
and
a
depraved
taste
in
any
finch
!
 
<EOS>
I
buy
that
goldfinch
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
send
home
,
and
hang
upon
a
nail
over
against
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
outside
a
counterfeit
dwelling
-
house
,
suppose
(
as
I
argue
)
to
be
a
dyer
's
;
otherwise
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
account
for
his
perch
stick
out
of
the
garret
window
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
time
of
his
appearance
in
my
room
,
either
he
leave
off
be
thirsty
---
which
be
not
in
the
bond
---
or
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
hear
his
little
bucket
drop
back
into
his
well
when
he
let
it
go
:
 
<EOS>
a
shock
which
in
the
good
of
time
have
make
him
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
no
water
but
by
stealth
and
under
the
cloak
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
after
an
interval
of
futile
and
at
length
hopeless
expectation
,
the
merchant
who
have
educate
him
be
appeal
to
.
<EOS>
the
merchant
be
a
bow
-
legged
character
,
with
a
flat
and
cushiony
nose
,
like
the
last
new
strawberry
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
fur
cap
,
and
short
,
and
be
of
the
velveteen
race
,
velveteeny
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
word
that
he
would
"
look
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
,
appear
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
,
and
slightly
cock
up
his
evil
eye
at
the
goldfinch
.
<EOS>
instantly
a
rage
thirst
beset
that
bird
;
when
it
be
appease
,
he
still
draw
several
unnecessary
bucket
of
water
;
and
finally
,
leap
about
his
perch
and
sharpen
his
bill
,
as
if
he
have
be
to
the
near
wine
vault
and
get
drunk

what
he
do
for
a
costermonger
.
 
<EOS>
feed
him
with
oats
at
the
high
price
,
put
an
infant
prince
and
princess
in
a
pair
of
pannier
on
his
back
,
adjust
his
delicate
trapping
to
a
nicety
,
take
him
to
the
soft
slope
at
Windsor
,
and
try
what
pace
you
can
get
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
starve
him
,
harness
him
anyhow
to
a
truck
with
a
flat
tray
on
it
,
and
see
him
bowl
from
Whitechapel
to
Bayswater
.
 
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
no
particular
private
understanding
between
bird
and
donkey
,
in
a
state
of
nature
;
but
in
the
shy
neighbourhood
state
,
you
shall
see
them
always
in
the
same
hand
and
always
develop
their
very
good
energy
for
the
very
bad
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
donkey
---
by
sight
;
we
be
not
on
speak
term
---
who
live
over
on
the
Surrey
side
of
London
-
bridge
,
among
the
fastness
of
Jacob
's
Island
and
Dockhead
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
habit
of
that
animal
,
when
his
service
be
not
in
immediate
requisition
,
to
go
out
alone
,
idle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
meet
him
a
mile
from
his
place
of
residence
,
loiter
about
the
street
;
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
at
such
time
be
most
degrade
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
attach
to
the
establishment
of
an
elderly
lady
who
sell
periwinkle
,
and
he
use
to
stand
on
Saturday
night
with
a
cartful
of
those
delicacy
outside
a
gin
-
shop
,
prick
up
his
ear
when
a
customer
come
to
the
cart
,
and
too
evidently
derive
satisfaction
from
the
knowledge
that
they
get
bad
measure
.
<EOS>
His
mistress
be
sometimes
overtake
by
inebriety
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
time
I
ever
see
him
(
about
five
year
ago
)
<EOS>
he
be
in
circumstance
of
difficulty
,
cause
by
this
failing
.
 
<EOS>
have
be
leave
alone
with
the
cart
of
periwinkle
,
and
forget
,
he
go
off
idle
.
 
<EOS>
He
prowl
among
his
usual
low
haunt
for
some
time
,
gratify
his
depraved
taste
,
until
,
not
take
the
cart
into
his
calculation
<EOS>
,
he
endeavour
to
turn
up
a
narrow
alley
,
and
become
greatly
involved
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
into
custody
by
the
police
,
and
,
the
Green
Yard
of
the
district
be
near
at
hand
,
be
back
into
that
place
of
durance
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
crisis
,
I
encounter
him
;
the
stubborn
sense
he
evince
of
be
---
not
to
compromise
the
expression
---
a
blackguard
<EOS>
,
I
never
see
exceed
in
the
human
subject
.
 
<EOS>
a
flare
candle
in
a
paper
shade
,
stick
in
among
his
periwinkle
,
show
him
,
with
his
ragged
harness
break
and
his
cart
extensively
shatter
,
twitch
his
mouth
and
shake
his
hang
head
,
a
picture
of
disgrace
and
obduracy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
boy
be
take
to
station
-
house
,
who
be
as
like
him
as
his
own
brother
.
   
<EOS>
the
dog
of
shy
neighbourhood
,
I
observe
to
avoid
play
,
and
to
be
conscious
of
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
They
avoid
work
,
too
,
if
they
can
,
of
course
;
that
be
in
the
nature
of
all
animal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
to
know
a
dog
in
a
back
street
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Walworth
,
who
have
greatly
distinguish
himself
in
the
minor
drama
,
and
who
take
his
portrait
with
him
when
he
make
an
engagement
,
for
the
illustration
of
the
play
-
bill
.
 
<EOS>
His
portrait
(
which
be
not
at
all
like
him
)
represent
him
in
the
act
of
drag
to
the
earth
a
recreant
Indian
,
who
be
suppose
to
have
tomahawk
,
or
essay
to
tomahawk
,
a
british
officer
.
 
<EOS>
the
design
be
pure
poetry
,
for
there
be
no
such
Indian
in
the
piece
,
and
no
such
incident
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
dog
of
the
Newfoundland
breed
,
for
whose
honesty
<EOS>
I
would
be
bail
to
any
amount
;
but
whose
intellectual
quality
in
association
with
dramatic
fiction
,
I
can
not
rate
high
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
too
honest
for
the
profession
he
have
enter
.
 
<EOS>
be
at
a
town
in
Yorkshire
last
summer
,
and
see
him
post
in
the
bill
of
the
night
,
I
attend
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
scene
be
eminently
successful
;
but
,
as
it
occupy
a
second
in
its
representation
(
and
five
line
in
the
bill
)
,
it
scarcely
afford
ground
for
a
cool
and
deliberate
judgment
of
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
merely
to
bark
,
run
on
,
and
jump
through
an
inn
window
,
after
a
comic
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
scene
of
importance
to
the
fable
be
a
little
marred
in
its
interest
by
his
over
-
anxiety
;
forasmuch
as
while
his
master
(
a
belate
soldier
in
a
den
of
robber
on
a
tempestuous
night
)
be
feelingly
lament
the
absence
of
his
faithful
dog
,
and
lay
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
he
be
thirty
league
away
,
the
faithful
dog
be
bark
furiously
in
the
prompter
's
box
,
and
clearly
choke
himself
against
his
collar
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
his
great
scene
of
all
,
that
his
honesty
get
the
well
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
to
enter
a
dense
and
trackless
forest
,
on
the
trail
of
the
murderer
,
and
there
to
fly
at
the
murderer
when
he
find
him
rest
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
,
with
his
victim
bind
ready
for
slaughter
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
hot
night
,
and
he
come
into
the
forest
from
an
altogether
unexpected
direction
,
in
the
sweetest
temper
,
at
a
very
deliberate
trot
,
not
in
the
least
excited
<EOS>
;
trot
to
the
foot
-
light
with
his
tongue
out
;
and
there
sit
down
,
pant
,
and
amiably
survey
the
audience
,
with
his
tail
beat
on
the
board
,
like
a
dutch
clock
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
murderer
,
impatient
to
receive
his
doom
,
be
audibly
call
to
him
"
CO
-
O
-
OME
here
!
"
<EOS>
while
the
victim
,
struggle
with
his
bond
,
assail
him
with
the
most
injurious
expression
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
through
these
mean
,
that
when
he
be
in
course
of
time
persuade
to
trot
up
and
rend
the
murderer
limb
from
limb
,
he
make
it
(
for
dramatic
purpose
)
a
little
too
obvious
that
he
work
out
that
awful
retribution
by
lick
butter
off
his
blood
-
stain
hand
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
shy
street
,
behind
Long
-
acre
,
two
honest
dog
live
,
who
perform
in
Punch
's
show
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
venture
to
say
that
I
be
on
term
of
intimacy
with
both
,
and
that
I
never
see
either
guilty
of
the
falsehood
of
fail
to
look
down
at
the
man
inside
the
show
,
during
the
whole
performance
.
 
<EOS>
the
difficulty
other
dog
have
in
satisfy
their
mind
about
these
dog
,
appear
to
be
never
overcome
by
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
dog
must
encounter
them
over
and
over
again
,
as
they
trudge
along
in
their
off
-
minute
behind
the
leg
of
the
show
and
beside
the
drum
;
but
all
dog
seem
to
suspect
their
frill
and
jacket
,
and
to
sniff
at
them
as
if
they
think
those
article
of
personal
adornment
,
an
eruption
---
a
something
in
the
nature
of
mange
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
Covent
-
garden
window
of
mine
I
notice
a
country
dog
,
only
the
other
day
,
who
have
come
up
to
covent
-
garden
market
under
a
cart
,
and
have
break
his
cord
,
an
end
of
which
he
still
trail
along
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
loiter
about
the
corner
of
the
four
street
command
by
my
window
;
and
bad
London
dog
come
up
,
and
tell
him
lie
that
he
do
not
believe
;
and
bad
London
dog
come
up
,
and
make
proposal
to
him
to
go
and
steal
in
the
market
,
which
his
principle
reject
;
and
the
way
of
the
town
confuse
him
,
and
he
creep
aside
and
lie
down
in
a
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
get
a
wink
of
sleep
,
when
up
come
Punch
with
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dart
to
Toby
for
consolation
and
advice
,
when
he
see
the
frill
,
and
stop
,
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
appal
.
 
<EOS>
the
show
be
pitch
,
Toby
retire
behind
the
drapery
,
the
audience
form
,
the
drum
and
pipe
strike
up
.
 
<EOS>
My
country
dog
remain
immovable
,
intently
stare
at
these
strange
appearance
,
until
Toby
open
the
drama
by
appear
on
his
ledge
,
and
to
him
enter
Punch
,
who
put
a
tobacco
-
pipe
into
Toby
's
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
spectacle
,
the
country
dog
throw
up
his
head
,
give
one
terrible
howl
,
and
flee
due
west
.
   
<EOS>
We
talk
of
man
keep
dog
,
but
we
may
often
talk
more
expressively
of
dog
keep
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
a
bull
-
dog
in
a
shy
corner
of
Hammersmith
who
keep
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
keep
him
up
a
yard
,
and
make
him
go
to
public
-
house
and
lie
wager
on
him
,
and
oblige
him
to
lean
against
post
and
look
at
him
,
and
force
him
to
neglect
work
for
him
,
and
keep
him
under
rigid
coercion
.
 
<EOS>
I
once
know
a
fancy
terrier
who
keep
a
gentleman
---
a
gentleman
who
have
be
bring
up
at
Oxford
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
the
dog
keep
the
gentleman
entirely
for
his
glorification
,
and
the
gentleman
never
talk
about
anything
but
the
terrier
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
in
a
shy
neighbourhood
,
and
be
a
digression
consequently
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
dog
in
shy
neighbourhood
,
who
keep
boy
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
eye
on
a
mongrel
in
Somerstown
who
keep
three
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
feign
that
he
can
bring
down
sparrow
,
and
unburrow
rat
(
he
can
do
neither
)
,
and
he
take
the
boy
out
on
sport
pretence
into
all
sort
of
suburban
field
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
likewise
make
them
believe
that
he
possess
some
mysterious
knowledge
of
the
art
of
fishing
,
and
they
consider
themselves
incompletely
equip
for
the
Hampstead
pond
,
with
a
pickle
-
jar
and
wide
-
mouthed
bottle
,
unless
he
be
with
them
and
bark
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
dog
reside
in
the
Borough
of
Southwark
who
keep
a
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
see
,
most
day
,
in
Oxford
-
street
,
hale
the
blind
man
away
on
expedition
wholly
uncontemplate
by
,
and
unintelligible
to
,
the
man
:
 
wholly
of
the
dog
's
conception
and
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Contrariwise
,
when
the
man
have
project
,
the
dog
will
sit
down
in
a
crowded
thoroughfare
and
meditate
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
yesterday
,
wear
the
money
-
tray
like
an
easy
collar
,
instead
of
offer
it
to
the
public
,
take
the
man
against
his
will
,
on
the
invitation
of
a
disreputable
cur
,
apparently
to
visit
a
dog
at
Harrow
---
he
be
so
intent
on
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
the
north
wall
of
Burlington
House
Gardens
,
between
the
Arcade
and
the
Albany
,
offer
a
shy
spot
for
appointment
among
blind
man
at
about
two
or
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
They
sit
(
very
uncomfortably
)
on
a
sloping
stone
there
,
and
compare
note
.
 
<EOS>
Their
dog
may
always
be
observe
at
the
same
time
,
openly
disparage
the
man
they
keep
,
to
one
another
,
and
settle
where
they
shall
respectively
take
their
man
when
they
begin
to
move
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
small
butcher
's
,
in
a
shy
neighbourhood
(
there
be
no
reason
for
suppress
the
name
;
it
be
by
Nottinghill
,
and
give
upon
the
district
call
the
Potteries
)
,
I
know
a
shaggy
black
and
white
dog
who
keep
a
drover
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
dog
of
an
easy
disposition
,
and
too
frequently
allow
this
drover
to
get
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
,
it
be
the
dog
's
custom
to
sit
outside
the
public
-
house
,
keep
his
eye
on
a
few
sheep
,
and
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
with
six
sheep
,
plainly
cast
up
in
his
mind
how
many
he
begin
with
when
he
leave
the
market
,
and
at
what
place
he
have
leave
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
perplex
by
not
be
able
to
account
to
himself
for
certain
particular
sheep
.
 
<EOS>
a
light
have
gradually
break
on
him
,
he
have
remember
at
what
butcher
be
he
leave
them
,
and
in
a
burst
of
grave
satisfaction
have
catch
a
fly
off
his
nose
,
and
show
himself
much
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
at
any
time
have
doubt
the
fact
that
it
be
he
who
keep
the
drover
,
and
not
the
drover
who
keep
him
,
it
would
have
be
abundantly
prove
by
his
way
of
take
undivided
charge
of
the
six
sheep
,
when
the
drover
come
out
besmear
with
red
ochre
and
beer
,
and
give
him
wrong
direction
,
which
he
calmly
disregard
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
the
sheep
entirely
into
his
own
hand
,
have
merely
remark
with
respectful
firmness
,
"
that
instruction
would
place
them
under
an
omnibus
;
you
have
well
confine
your
attention
to
yourself
---
you
will
want
it
all
;
"
and
have
drive
his
charge
away
,
with
an
intelligence
of
ear
and
tail
,
and
a
knowledge
of
business
,
that
have
leave
his
lout
of
a
man
very
,
very
far
behind
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
dog
of
shy
neighbourhood
usually
betray
a
slinking
consciousness
of
be
in
poor
circumstance
---
for
the
most
part
manifest
in
an
aspect
of
anxiety
,
an
awkwardness
in
their
play
,
and
a
misgiving
that
somebody
be
go
to
harness
them
to
something
,
to
pick
up
a
living
---
so
the
cat
of
shy
neighbourhood
exhibit
a
strong
tendency
to
relapse
into
barbarism
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
be
they
make
selfishly
ferocious
by
ruminate
on
the
surplus
population
around
them
,
and
on
the
densely
crowded
state
of
all
the
avenue
to
cat
's
meat
;
not
only
be
there
a
moral
and
politico
-
economical
haggardness
in
them
,
traceable
to
these
reflection
;
but
they
evince
a
physical
deterioration
.
 
<EOS>
Their
linen
be
not
clean
,
and
be
wretchedly
get
up
;
their
black
turn
rusty
,
like
old
mourning
;
they
wear
very
indifferent
fur
;
and
take
to
the
shabby
cotton
velvet
,
instead
of
silk
velvet
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
on
term
of
recognition
with
several
small
street
of
cat
,
about
the
Obelisk
in
Saint
George
's
Fields
,
and
also
in
the
vicinity
of
Clerkenwell
-
green
,
and
also
in
the
back
settlement
of
Drury
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
in
appearance
,
they
be
very
like
the
woman
among
whom
they
live
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
turn
out
of
their
unwholesome
bed
into
the
street
,
without
any
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
They
leave
their
young
family
to
stagger
about
the
gutter
,
unassiste
,
while
they
frouzily
quarrel
and
swear
and
scratch
and
spit
,
at
street
corner
.
 
<EOS>
in
particular
,
I
remark
that
when
they
be
about
to
increase
their
family
(
an
event
of
frequent
recurrence
)
the
resemblance
be
strongly
express
in
a
certain
dusty
dowdiness
,
down
-
at
-
heel
self
-
neglect
,
and
general
give
up
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
honestly
report
that
I
have
ever
see
a
feline
matron
of
this
class
wash
her
face
when
in
an
interesting
condition
.
   
<EOS>
not
to
prolong
these
note
of
uncommercial
travel
among
the
low
animal
of
shy
neighbourhood
,
by
dwell
at
length
upon
the
exasperate
moodiness
of
the
tom
-
cats
,
and
their
resemblance
in
many
respect
to
a
man
and
a
brother
,
I
will
come
to
a
close
with
a
word
on
the
fowl
of
the
same
locality
.
   
<EOS>
that
anything
bear
of
an
egg
and
invest
with
wing
,
should
have
get
to
the
pass
that
it
hop
contentedly
down
a
ladder
into
a
cellar
,
and
call
that
go
home
,
be
a
circumstance
so
amazing
as
to
leave
one
nothing
more
in
this
connexion
to
wonder
at
.
<EOS>
otherwise
I
may
wonder
at
the
completeness
with
which
these
fowl
have
become
separate
from
all
the
bird
of
the
air
---
have
take
to
grovel
in
brick
and
mortar
and
mud
---
have
forget
all
about
live
tree
,
and
make
roosting
-
place
of
shop
-
board
,
barrow
,
oyster
-
tub
,
bulk
-
head
,
and
door
-
scraper
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
nothing
concern
them
,
and
take
them
as
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
as
product
of
nature
and
thing
of
course
,
a
reduce
Bantam
family
of
my
acquaintance
in
the
Hackney
-
road
,
who
be
incessantly
at
the
pawnbroker
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
they
enjoy
themselves
,
for
they
be
of
a
melancholy
temperament
;
but
what
enjoyment
they
be
capable
of
<EOS>
,
they
derive
from
crowd
together
in
the
pawnbroker
's
side
-
entry
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
they
be
always
to
be
find
in
a
feeble
flutter
,
as
if
they
be
newly
come
down
in
the
world
,
and
be
afraid
of
be
identify
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
a
low
fellow
,
originally
of
a
good
family
from
Dorking
,
who
take
his
whole
establishment
of
wife
,
in
single
file
,
in
at
the
door
of
the
jug
Department
of
a
disorderly
tavern
near
the
Haymarket
,
manoeuvre
them
among
the
company
's
leg
,
emerge
with
them
at
the
Bottle
Entrance
,
and
so
pass
his
life
:
seldom
,
in
the
season
,
go
to
bed
before
two
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
over
Waterloo
-
bridge
,
there
be
a
shabby
old
speckle
couple
(
they
belong
to
the
wooden
French
-
bedstead
,
washing
-
stand
,
and
towel
-
horse
-
make
trade
)
,
who
be
always
try
to
get
in
at
the
door
of
a
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
old
lady
,
under
a
delusion
remind
one
of
Mrs
Southcott
,
have
an
idea
of
entrust
an
egg
to
that
particular
denomination
,
or
merely
understand
that
she
have
no
business
in
the
building
and
be
consequently
frantic
to
enter
it
,
I
can
not
determine
;
but
she
be
constantly
endeavour
to
undermine
the
principal
door
:
 
while
her
partner
,
who
be
infirm
upon
his
leg
,
walk
up
and
down
,
encourage
her
and
defy
the
Universe
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
family
I
have
be
best
acquaint
with
,
since
the
removal
from
this
try
sphere
of
a
chinese
circle
at
Brentford
,
reside
in
the
dense
part
of
Bethnal
-
green
.
 
<EOS>
Their
abstraction
from
the
object
among
which
they
live
,
or
rather
their
conviction
that
those
object
have
all
come
into
existence
in
express
subservience
to
fowl
,
have
so
enchant
me
,
that
I
have
make
them
the
subject
of
many
journey
at
diver
hour
.
 
<EOS>
after
careful
observation
of
the
two
lord
and
the
ten
lady
of
whom
this
family
consist
,
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
their
opinion
be
represent
by
the
lead
lord
and
lead
lady
:
 
<EOS>
the
latter
,
as
I
judge
,
an
aged
personage
,
afflict
with
a
paucity
of
feather
and
visibility
of
quill
<EOS>
,
that
give
her
the
appearance
of
a
bundle
of
office
pen
.
<EOS>
when
a
railway
good
van
that
would
crush
an
elephant
come
round
the
corner
,
tear
over
these
fowl
,
they
emerge
unharmed
from
under
the
horse
,
perfectly
satisfy
that
the
whole
rush
be
a
pass
property
in
the
air
,
which
may
have
leave
something
to
eat
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
upon
old
shoe
,
wreck
of
kettle
and
saucepan
,
and
fragment
of
bonnet
,
as
a
kind
of
meteoric
discharge
,
for
fowl
to
peck
at
.
 
<EOS>
peg
-
top
and
hoop
<EOS>
they
account
,
I
think
,
as
a
sort
of
hail
;
shuttlecock
,
as
rain
,
or
dew
.
<EOS>
Gaslight
come
quite
as
natural
to
them
as
any
other
light
;
and
I
have
more
than
a
suspicion
that
,
in
the
mind
of
the
two
lord
,
the
early
public
-
house
at
the
corner
have
supersede
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
establish
it
as
a
certain
fact
,
that
they
always
begin
to
crow
when
the
public
-
house
shutter
begin
to
be
take
down
,
and
that
they
salute
the
potboy
,
the
instant
he
appear
to
perform
that
duty
,
as
if
he
be
Phoebus
in
person
.
    
<EOS>
Number
10
:
<EOS>
tramp
 
<EOS>
the
chance
use
of
the
word
"
Tramp
"
in
my
last
paper
,
bring
that
numerous
fraternity
so
vividly
before
my
mind
's
eye
,
that
I
have
no
sooner
lay
down
my
pen
than
a
compulsion
be
upon
me
to
take
it
up
again
,
and
make
note
of
the
Tramps
whom
I
perceive
on
all
the
summer
road
in
all
direction
.
   
<EOS>
whenever
a
tramp
sit
down
to
rest
by
the
wayside
,
he
sit
with
his
leg
in
a
dry
ditch
;
and
whenever
he
go
to
sleep
(
which
be
very
often
indeed
)
,
he
go
to
sleep
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Yonder
,
by
the
high
road
,
glare
white
in
the
bright
sunshine
,
lie
,
on
the
dusty
bit
of
turf
under
the
bramble
-
bush
that
fence
the
coppice
from
the
highway
,
the
tramp
of
the
order
savage
,
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
lie
on
the
broad
of
his
back
,
with
his
face
turn
up
to
the
sky
,
and
one
of
his
ragged
arm
loosely
throw
across
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
His
bundle
<EOS>
(
what
can
be
the
content
of
that
mysterious
bundle
,
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
carry
it
about
?
)
be
throw
down
beside
him
,
and
the
wake
woman
with
him
sit
with
her
leg
in
the
ditch
,
and
her
back
to
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
She
wear
her
bonnet
rakishly
perch
on
the
front
of
her
head
,
to
shade
her
face
from
the
sun
in
walk
,
and
she
tie
her
skirt
round
her
in
conventionally
tight
tramp
-
fashion
with
a
sort
of
apron
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
seldom
catch
sight
of
her
,
rest
thus
,
without
see
her
in
a
despondently
defiant
manner
do
something
to
her
hair
or
her
bonnet
,
and
glance
at
you
between
her
finger
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
often
go
to
sleep
herself
in
the
daytime
,
but
will
sit
for
any
length
of
time
beside
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
slumberous
propensity
would
not
seem
to
be
referable
to
the
fatigue
of
carry
the
bundle
,
for
she
carry
it
much
oftener
and
further
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
afoot
,
you
will
mostly
find
him
slouch
on
ahead
,
in
a
gruff
temper
,
while
she
lag
heavily
behind
with
the
burden
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
give
to
personally
correct
her
,
too
---
which
phase
of
his
character
develop
itself
oftenest
,
on
bench
outside
alehouse
door
---
and
she
appear
to
become
strongly
attached
to
him
for
these
reason
;
it
may
usually
be
notice
that
when
the
poor
creature
have
a
bruise
face
,
she
be
the
most
affectionate
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
occupation
whatever
,
this
order
of
tramp
,
and
have
no
object
<EOS>
whatever
in
go
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
sometimes
call
himself
a
brickmaker
,
or
a
sawyer
,
but
only
when
he
take
an
imaginary
flight
.
 
<EOS>
He
generally
represent
himself
,
in
a
vague
way
,
as
look
out
for
a
job
of
work
;
but
he
never
do
work
,
he
never
do
,
and
he
never
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
favourite
fiction
with
him
,
however
(
as
if
he
be
the
most
industrious
character
on
earth
)
,
that
you
never
work
;
and
as
he
go
past
your
garden
and
see
you
look
at
your
flower
,
you
will
overhear
him
growl
with
a
strong
sense
of
contrast
,
"
you
be
a
lucky
hidle
devil
,
you
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
slinking
tramp
be
of
the
same
hopeless
order
,
and
have
the
same
injure
conviction
on
him
that
you
be
bear
to
whatever
you
possess
,
and
never
do
anything
to
get
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
of
a
less
audacious
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
stop
before
your
gate
,
and
say
to
his
female
companion
with
an
air
of
constitutional
humility
and
propitiation
---
to
edify
any
one
who
may
be
within
hear
behind
a
blind
or
a
bush
---
"
this
be
a
sweet
spot
,
be
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
a
lovely
spot
!
<EOS>
and
I
wonder
if
they
would
give
two
poor
footsore
traveller
like
me
and
you
,
a
drop
of
fresh
water
out
of
such
a
pretty
gen
-
teel
crib
?
<EOS>
We
would
take
it
wery
koind
on
'em
,
would
not
us
?
 
<EOS>
wery
koind
,
upon
my
word
,
us
would
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
quick
sense
of
a
dog
in
the
vicinity
,
and
will
extend
his
modestly
-
injure
propitiation
to
the
dog
chain
up
in
your
yard
;
remarking
,
as
he
slink
at
the
yard
gate
,
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
foine
breed
o
'
dog
,
too
,
and
you
be
not
kep
for
nothink

<EOS>
I
would
take
it
<EOS>
wery
koind
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
your
master
if
he
would
elp
a
traveller
and
his

no
gentlefolk
their

fortun
,
wi

<EOS>
a
bit
o

your
broken

.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
know
the
want
of
it
,
nor
more
would
you
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
bark
like
that
,
at
poor
person
as
never
do
you
no
arm
;
the
poor
be
down
-
trodden
and
break
enough
without
that
;
o
don't
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
generally
heave
a
prodigious
sigh
in
move
away
,
and
always
look
up
the
lane
and
down
the
lane
,
and
up
the
road
and
down
the
road
,
before
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
both
of
these
order
of
tramp
be
of
a
very
robust
habit
;
let
the
hard
-
working
labourer
at
whose
cottage
-
door
they
prowl
and
beg
,
have
the
ague
<EOS>
never
so
badly
,
these
tramp
be
sure
to
be
in
good
health
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
kind
of
tramp
,
whom
you
encounter
this
bright
summer
day
---
say
,
on
a
road
with
the
sea
-
breeze
make
its
dust
lively
,
and
sail
of
ship
in
the
blue
distance
beyond
the
slope
of
Down
.
 
<EOS>
as
you
walk
enjoyingly
on
,
you
descry
in
the
perspective
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
up
which
your
way
lie
,
a
figure
that
appear
to
be
sit
airily
on
a
gate
,
whistle
in
a
cheerful
and
disengaged
manner
.
 
<EOS>
as
you
approach
nearer
to
it
,
you
observe
the
figure
to
slide
down
from
the
gate
,
to
desist
from
whistle
,
to
uncock
its
hat
,
to
become
tender
of
foot
,
to
depress
its
head
and
elevate
its
shoulder
,
and
to
present
all
the
characteristic
of
profound
despondency
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
come
close
to
the
figure
,
you
observe
it
to
be
the
figure
of
a
shabby
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
move
painfully
forward
,
in
the
direction
in
which
you
be
go
,
and
his
mind
be
so
preoccupied
with
his
misfortune
that
he
be
not
aware
of
your
approach
until
you
be
close
upon
him
at
the
hill
-
foot
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
aware
of
you
,
you
discover
him
to
be
a
remarkably
well
-
behave
young
man
,
and
a
remarkably
well

speak
young
man

<EOS>
You

him
to

by
his
respectful
manner
of
touch
his

by

<EOS>
He
say
in
a
flowing
confidential
voice
,
and
without
punctuation
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon

You

You

some
eighteen

the

to
my

even

the

there

handicraft
man

be
they
not

England

Midsummer

where
do
the
lark
sing

the
corn
grow

the
mill
turn

the
river
run

they
be
not

tinkering
,
chair

umbrella
-
mending
,
clock
-
mending
,
knife
-
grinding
?
 
<EOS>
surely
,
a
pleasant
thing
,
if
we
be
in
that
condition
of
life
,
to
grind
our
way
through
Kent
,
Sussex
,
and
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
bad
six
week
or
so
,
we
should
see
the
spark
we
grind
off
,
fiery
bright
against
a
background
of
green
wheat
and
green
leave
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
later
,
and
the
ripe
harvest
would
pale
our
spark
from
red
to
yellow
,
until
we
get
the
dark
newly
-
turn
land
for
a
background
again
,
and
they
be
red
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time

we
should
have
grind
our

to
the
sea
cliff

the
whirr
of

would
be
lose
in
the
breaking
of
the
wave

<EOS>
Our
next
variety
in
spark
would
be
derive
from
contrast
with
the
gorgeous
medley
of
colour
in
the
autumn
wood
,
and
,
by
the
time
we
have
grind
our
way
round
to
the
heathy
land
between
Reigate
and
Croydon
,
do
a
prosperous
stroke
of
business
all
along
,
we
should
show
like
a
little
firework
in
the
light
frosty
air
,
and
be
the
next
good
thing
to
the
blacksmith
's
forge
.
<EOS>
very
agreeable
,
too
,
to
go
on
a
chair

mending
tour

<EOS>
what
judge
we
should
be
of
rush
,
and
how
knowingly
(
with
a
sheaf
and
a
bottomless
chair
at
our
back
)
we
should
lounge
on
bridge
,
look
over

<EOS>
among

the
innumerable
occupation
that
can
not

when
we
sit
down

against
the
barn

the
public

house
,
and
begin
to
mend
,
what
a
sense
of
popularity
would
grow
upon

!
 
<EOS>
when
all
the
child
come

the
tailor

the
slight

carry

under

and
the
monotony
of
make
the
bell
go
,
whenever
we
come

a

habitation
,
what
a
pleasant
privilege
to
give
a
voice
to
the
dumb
cottage

clock
,
and
set
it
talk
to
the
cottage
family
again

<EOS>
likewise
we
foresee
great
interest
in
go
round
by
the
park
plantation

under
the
overhang
bough
(
hare

rabbit
,
partridge

across
the
chequer

and
so
over
the
park
ladder
,
and
through
the
wood
,
until
we
come
to
the
Keeper

lodge

<EOS>
then
,
would
,
the
Keeper
be
discoverable
at
his
door
,
in
a
deep
nest

smoke
his
pipe

<EOS>
then
,
on
our
accost
him
in
the
way
of
our
trade
,
would
he
call
to
Mrs
Keeper
,
respect
"
t'ould
clock
"
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
then
,
would
Mrs
Keeper
ask
us
into
the
lodge
,
and
on
due
examination
we
should
offer
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
for
eighteenpence
;
which
offer
,
be
accept
,
would
set
us
tinkle
and
clink
among
the
chubby
,
awe
-
strike
little
Keepers
for
an
hour
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
so
completely
to
the
family
's
satisfaction
would
we
achieve
our
work
,
that
the
Keeper
would
mention
how
that
there
be
something
wrong
with
the
bell
of
the
turret
stable
-
clock
up
at
the
Hall
,
and
that
if
we
think
good
of
go
up
to
the
housekeeper
on
the
chance
of
that
job
too
,
why
he
would
take
us
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
should
we
go
,
among
the
branching
oak
and
the
deep
fern
,
by
silent
way
of
mystery
know
to
the
Keeper
,
see
the
herd
glance
here
and
there
as
we
go
along
,
until
we
come
to
the
old
Hall
,
solemn
and
grand
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
Terrace
Flower
Garden
,
and
round
by
the
stable
,
would
the
Keeper
take
us
in
,
and
as
we
pass
we
should
observe
how
spacious
and
stately
the
stable
,
and
how
fine
the
painting
of
the
horse
'
name
over
their
stall
,
and
how
solitary
all
:
 
<EOS>
the
family
be
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
should
we
find
ourselves
present
to
the
housekeeper
,
sit
,
in
hushed
state
,
at
needlework
,
in
a
bay
-
window
look
out
upon
a
mighty
grim
red
-
brick
quadrangle
,
<EOS>
guard
by
stone
lion
disrespectfully
throw
somersault
over
the
escutcheon
of
the
noble
family
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
our
service
accept
and
we
insinuate
with
a
candle
into
the
stable
-
turret
,
we
should
find
it
to
be
a
mere
question
of
pendulum
,
but
one
that
would
hold
us
until
dark
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
should
we
fall
to
work
,
with
a
general
impression
of
Ghosts
be
about
,
and
of
picture
indoor
that
of
a
certainty
come
out
of
their
frame
and
"
walk
,
"
if
the
family
would
only
own
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
should
we
work
and
work
,
until
the
day
gradually
turn
to
dusk
,
and
even
until
the
dusk
gradually
turn
to
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Our
task
at
length
accomplish
,
we
should
be
take
into
an
enormous
servant
'
hall
,
and
there
regale
with
beef
and
bread
,
and
powerful
ale
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
pay
freely
,
we
should
be
at
liberty
to
go
,
and
should
be
tell
by
a
point
helper
to
keep
round
over
yinder
by
the
blast
ash
,
and
so
straight
through
the
wood
,
till
we
should
see
the
town
-
light
right
afore
us
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
feel
lonesome
,
should
we
desire
upon
the
whole
,
that
the
ash
have
not
be
blast
,
or
that
the
helper
have
have
the
manner
not
to
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
should
keep
on
,
all
right
,
till
suddenly
the
stable
bell
would
strike
ten
in
the
dolefull
way
,
quite
chill
our
blood
,
though
we
have
so
lately
teach
him
how
to
acquit
himself
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
we
go
on
,
should
we
recall
old
story
,
and
dimly
consider
what
it
would
be
most
advisable
to
do
,
in
the
event
of
a
tall
figure
,
all
in
white
,
with
saucer
eye
,
come
up
and
say
,
"
I
want
you
to
come
to
a
churchyard
and
mend
a
church
clock
.
 
<EOS>
follow
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
should
we
make
a
burst
to
get
clear
of
the
tree
,
and
should
soon
find
ourselves
in
the
open
,
with
the
town

light
bright
ahead
of
us

<EOS>
so
should
we

that
night
at
the

rise
early
next

It
lately
happen
that
I
find
myself
ramble
about
the
scene
among
which
my
early
day
be
pass
;
scene
from
which
I
depart
when
I
be
a
child
,
and
which
I
do
not
revisit
until
I
be
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
uncommon
chance
,
but
one
that
befall
some
of
us
any
day
;
perhaps
it
may
not
be
quite
uninteresting
to
compare
note
with
the
reader
respect
an
experience
so
familiar
and
a
journey
so
uncommercial

<EOS>
I
call
my
boyhood

I

<EOS>
Most

Dullborough

<EOS>
as
I
leave
Dullborough
in
the
day
when
there
be
no
railroad
in
the
land
,
I
leave
it
in
a
stage
-
coach
.
 
<EOS>
through
all
the
year
that
have
since
pass
,
have
I
ever
lose
the
smell
of
the
damp
straw
in
which
I
be
pack
---
like
game
---
and
forwarded
,
carriage
pay

to
the
Cross
Keys
,
Wood

street
,
Cheapside
,
London
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
inside
passenger
,
and
I
consume
my
sandwich
in
solitude
and
dreariness
,
and
it
rain
hard
all
the
way
,
and
I
think
life
sloppier
than
I
have
expect
to
find
it
.
   
<EOS>
with
this
tender
remembrance
upon
me
,
I
be
cavalierly
shunt
back
into
Dullborough
the
other
day
,
by
train
.
 
<EOS>
My
ticket
have
be
previously
collect
,
like
my
taxis
,
and
my
shine
new
portmanteau
have
have
a
great
plaster
stick
upon
it
,
and
I
have
be
defy
by
Act
of
Parliament
to
offer
an
objection
to
anything
that
be
do
to
it
,
or
me

penalty
of
not
less
than
forty
shilling
or
more
than
five
pound
,
compoundable
for
a
term
of
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
send
my
disfigured
property
on

the
hotel
,
I
begin
to
look
about
me
;
and
the
first

It

the

,
the

,
and
all
those
buttercup
and
daisy
,
have
give
place
to
the
stony
of
jolt
road
:
 
while
,
beyond
the
Station
,
an
ugly
dark
monster
of
a
tunnel
keep
its
jaw
open
,
as
if
it
have
swallow
them
and
be
ravenous
for
more
destruction

<EOS>
the

have
carry
me

belong
to

and
be
spit
ashe

<EOS>
when
I
have
be
let
out
at
the
platform
-
door
,
like
a
prisoner
whom
his
turnkey
grudgingly
release
,
I
look
in
again
over
the
low
wall
,
at
the
scene
of
depart
glory
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
in
the
haymake
time
,
have
I
be
deliver
from
the
dungeon
of
Seringapatam
,
an
immense
pile
(
of
haycock

,
by
my
own
countryman
,
the
victorious
British

boy

and
his

,
and
have
be
recognise
with
ecstasy
by
my
affiance
one
(
Miss
Green
)
,
who
have
come
all
the
way
from
England
(
second
house
in
the
terrace
)
to
ransom
me
,
and
marry
me
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
have
I
first
hear
in
confidence
,
from
one
whose
father
be
greatly
connect
,
be
under
Government
,
of
the
existence
of
a
terrible
bandit
,
call
"
the
Radicals

"
whose
principle
be
,
that
the
Prince
Regent
wear
stay
,
and
that
nobody
have
a
right
to
any
salary
,
and
that
the
army
and
navy
ought
to
be
put
down

horror
at
which
I
tremble
in
my
bed
,
after
supplicate
that
the
Radicals
may
be
speedily
take
and
hang
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
have
we
,
the
small
boy
of
bole
's
,
have
that
cricket
match
against
the
small
boy
of
cole

,
when
Boles
and
Coles
have
actually
meet
upon
the

,
and
when
,
instead
of
instantly
hit
out
at

another
with
the
utmost
fury
,
as
we
have
all
hope

those

and
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mrs

and
the

"
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
,
after
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
the
playing

field
be
a
Station
,
and
no

expectorate

on

and
<EOS>
the
whole
belong
by
Act
of
Parliament
to
SER
.
?
   
<EOS>
as
it
could
be
,
and
be
,
I
leave
the
place
with
a
heavy
heart
for
a
walk
all
over
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
and
first
of
Timpson
's
up
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
depart
from
Dullborough
in
the
strawy
arm
of
Timpson
's
Blue
-
Eyed
Maid
,
Timpson
's
be
a
moderate
-
sized
coach
-
office
(
in
fact
,
a
little
coach
-
office
)
,
with
an
oval
transparency
in
the
window
,
which
look
beautiful
by
night
,
represent
one
of
Timpson
's
coach
in
the
act
of
pass
a
milestone
on
the
London
road
with
great
velocity
,
completely
full
inside
and
out
,
and
all
the
passenger
dress
in
the
first
style
of
fashion
,
and
enjoy
themselves
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
no
such
place
as
Timpson
's
now
---
no
such
brick
and
rafter
,
not
to
mention
the
name
---
no
such
edifice
on
the
teem
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Pickford
have
come
and
knock
Timpson
be
down
.
 
<EOS>
Pickford
have
not
only
knock
Timpson
be
down
,
but
have
knock
two
or
three
house
down
on
each
side
of
Timpson
's
,
and
then
have
knock
the
whole
into
one
great
establishment
with
a
pair
of
big
gate
,
in
and
out
of
which
,
<EOS>
his
(
Pickford
's
)
waggon
be
,
in
these
day
,
always
rattle
,
with
their
driver
sit
up
so
high
,
that
they
look
in
at
the
second
-
floor
window
of
the
old
-
fashioned
house
in
the
high
-
street
as
they
shake
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
honour
of
Pickford
's
acquaintance
,
but
I
feel
that
he
have
do
me
an
injury
,
not
to
say
commit
an
act
of
boyslaughter
,
in
run
over
my
Childhood
in
this
rough
manner
;
and
if
ever
I
meet
Pickford
drive
one
of
his
own
monster
,
and
smoke
a
pipe
the
while
(
which
be
the
custom
of
his
man
)
,
he
shall
know
by
the
expression
of
my
eye
,
if
it
catch
his
,
that
there
be
something
wrong
between
us
.
   
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
feel
that
Pickford
have
no
right
to
come
rush
into
Dullborough
and
deprive
the
town
of
a
public
picture
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
take
down
the
transparent
stage
-
coach
,
he
ought
to
have
give
the
town
a
transparent
van
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
gloomy
conviction
that
Pickford
be
wholly
utilitarian
and
unimaginative
,
I
proceed
on
my
way
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
mercy
I
have
not
a
red
and
green
lamp
and
a
night
-
bell
at
my
door
,
for
in
my
very
young
day
I
be
take
to
so
many
lying
-
in
that
I
wonder
I
escape
become
a
professional
martyr
to
them
in
after
-
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
a
very
sympathetic
nurse
,
with
a
large
circle
of
married
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
however
that
be
,
as
I
continue
my
walk
through
Dullborough
,
I
find
many
house
to
be
solely
associate
in
my
mind
with
this
particular
interest
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
little
greengrocer
's
shop
,
down
certain
step
from
the
street
,
I
remember
to
have
wait
on
a
lady
who
have
have
four
child
(
I
be
afraid
to
write
five
,
though
I
fully
believe
it
be
five
)
at
a
birth
.
 
<EOS>
this
meritorious
woman
hold
quite
a
reception
in
her
room
on
the
morning
when
I
be
introduce
there
,
and
the
sight
of
the
house
bring
vividly
to
my
mind
how
the
four
(
five
)
<EOS>
deceased
young
people
lay
,
side
by
side
,
on
a
clean
cloth
on
a
chest
of
drawer
;
remind
me
by
a
homely
association
,
which
I
suspect
their
complexion
to
have
assist
,
of
pig
'
foot
as
they
be
usually
display
at
a
neat
tripe
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
hot
candle
be
hand
round
on
the
occasion
,
and
I
further
remember
as
I
stand
contemplate
the
greengrocer
's
,
that
a
subscription
be
enter
into
among
the
company
,
which
become
extremely
alarming
to
my
consciousness
of
have
pocket
-
money
on
my
person
.
 
<EOS>
this
fact
be
know
to
my
conductress
,
whoever
she
be
,
I
be
earnestly
exhort
to
contribute
,
but
resolutely
decline
:
therein
disgust
the
company
,
who
give
me
to
understand
that
I
must
dismiss
all
expectation
of
go
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
how
do
it
happen
that
when
all
else
be
change
wherever
one
go
,
there
yet
seem
,
in
every
place
,
to
be
some
few
people
who
never
alter
?
 
<EOS>
as
the
sight
of
the
greengrocer
's
house
recall
these
trivial
incident
of
long
ago
,
the
identical
greengrocer
appear
on
the
step
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
lean
his
shoulder
against
the
door
-
post
,
as
my
childish
eye
have
see
him
many
a
time
;
indeed
,
there
be
his
old
mark
on
the
door
-
post
yet
,
as
if
his
shadow
have
become
a
fixture
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
he
himself
;
he
may
formerly
have
be
an
old
-
looking
young
man
,
or
he
may
now
be
a
young
-
look
old
man
,
but
there
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
in
walk
along
the
street
,
I
have
as
yet
look
in
vain
for
a
familiar
face
,
or
even
a
transmit
face
;
here
be
the
very
greengrocer
who
have
be
weigh
and
handle
basket
on
the
morning
of
the
reception
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
bring
with
him
a
dawn
remembrance
that
he
have
have
no
proprietary
interest
in
those
baby
,
I
cross
the
road
,
and
accost
him
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
the
least
excited
or
gratify
,
or
in
any
way
rouse
,
by
the
accuracy
of
my
recollection
,
but
say
,
yes
,
summut
out
of
the
common
---
he
do
not
remember
how
many
it
be
(
as
if
half
-
a
-
dozen
babe
either
way
make
no
difference
)
---
have
happen
to
a
Mrs
What's
-
her
-
name
,
as
once
lodge
there
---
but
he
do
not
call
it
to
mind
,
particular
.
 
<EOS>
nettle
by
this
phlegmatic
conduct
,
I
inform
him
that
I
have
leave
the
town
when
I
be
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
slowly
return
,
quite
unsoftened
,
and
not
without
a
sarcastic
kind
of
complacency
,
have
I
?
 
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
and
do
I
find
it
have
get
on
tolerably
well
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
difference
(
I
think
,
when
I
have
leave
him
a
few
hundred
yard
behind
,
and
be
by
so
much
in
a
well
temper
)
between
go
away
from
a
place
and
remain
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
<EOS>
,
I
reflect
,
to
be
angry
with
the
greengrocer
for
his
want
of
interest
,
I
be
nothing
to
him
:
 
whereas
he
be
the
town
,
the
cathedral
,
the
bridge
,
the
river
,
my
childhood
,
and
a
large
slice
of
my
life
,
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
the
town
have
shrink
fearfully
,
since
I
be
a
child
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
entertain
the
impression
that
the
high
-
street
be
at
least
as
wide
as
regent
-
street
,
London
,
or
the
Italian
Boulevard
at
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
little
well
than
a
lane
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
public
clock
in
it
,
which
I
have
suppose
to
be
the
fine
clock
in
the
world
:
 
whereas
it
now
turn
out
to
be
as
inexpressive
,
moon
-
face
,
and
weak
a
clock
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
belong
to
a
Town
Hall
,
where
I
have
see
an
Indian
(
who
I
now
suppose
be
not
an
Indian
)
swallow
a
sword
(
which
I
now
suppose
he
do
not
)
.
 
<EOS>
the
edifice
have
appear
to
me
in
those
day
so
glorious
a
structure
,
that
I
have
set
it
up
in
my
mind
as
the
model
on
which
the
Genie
of
the
Lamp
build
the
palace
for
Aladdin
.
 
<EOS>
a
mean
little
brick
heap
,
like
a
demente
chapel
,
with
a
few
yawn
person
in
leather
gaiter
,
and
in
the
last
extremity
for
something
to
do
,
lounge
at
the
door
with
their
hand
in
their
pocket
,
and
call
themselves
a
Corn
Exchange
!
   
<EOS>
the
Theatre
be
in
existence
,
I
find
,
on
ask
the
fishmonger
,
who
have
a
compact
show
of
stock
in
his
window
,
consist
of
a
sole
and
a
quart
of
shrimp
---
and
I
resolve
to
comfort
my
mind
by
go
to
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
the
Third
,
in
a
very
uncomfortable
cloak
,
have
first
appear
to
me
there
,
and
have
make
my
heart
leap
with
terror
by
back
up
against
the
stage
-
box
in
which
I
be
post
,
while
struggle
for
life
against
the
virtuous
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
within
those
wall
that
I
have
learn
as
from
a
page
of
english
history
,
how
that
wicke
King
sleep
in
war
-
time
on
a
sofa
much
too
short
for
him
,
and
how
fearfully
his
conscience
trouble
his
boot
.
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
have
I
first
see
the
funny
countryman
,
but
countryman
of
noble
principle
,
in
a
flower
waistcoat
,
crunch
up
his
little
hat
and
throw
it
on
the
ground
,
and
pull
off
his
coat
,
say
,
"
Dom
thee
,
squire
,
coom
on
with
thy
fiste
then
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
the
lovely
young
woman
who
keep
company
with
him
(
and
who
go
out
glean
,
in
a
narrow
white
muslin
apron
with
five
beautiful
bar
of
five
different
-
coloured
ribbon
across
it
)
be
so
frightened
for
his
sake
,
that
she
faint
away
.
 
<EOS>
many
wondrous
secret
of
Nature
have
I
come
to
the
knowledge
of
in
that
sanctuary
:
 
<EOS>
of
which
not
the
least
terrific
be
,
that
the
witch
in
Macbeth
bear
an
awful
resemblance
to
the
Thanes
and
other
proper
inhabitant
of
Scotland
;
and
that
the
good
King
Duncan
could
not
rest
in
his
grave
,
but
be
constantly
come
out
of
it
and
call
himself
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
Theatre
,
therefore
,
I
repair
for
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
very
little
,
for
it
be
in
a
bad
and
decline
way
.
 
<EOS>
a
dealer
in
wine
and
bottle
beer
have
already
squeeze
his
trade
into
the
box
-
office
,
and
the
theatrical
money
be
take
---
when
it
come
---
in
a
kind
of
meat
-
safe
in
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
the
dealer
in
wine
and
bottled
beer
must
have
insinuate
himself
under
the
stage
too
;
for
he
announce
that
he
have
various
description
of
alcoholic
drink
"
in
the
wood
,
"
and
there
be
no
possible
stowage
for
the
wood
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
evidently
,
he
be
by
degree
eat
the
establishment
away
to
the
core
,
and
would
soon
have
sole
possession
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
let
,
and
hopelessly
so
,
for
its
old
purpose
;
and
there
have
be
no
entertainment
within
its
wall
for
a
long
time
except
a
Panorama
;
and
even
that
have
be
announce
as
"
pleasingly
instructive
,
"
and
I
know
too
well
<EOS>
the
fatal
meaning
and
the
leaden
import
of
those
terrible
expression
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
there
be
no
comfort
in
the
Theatre
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
mysteriously
go
,
like
my
own
youth
.
 
<EOS>
unlike
my
own
youth
,
it
may
be
come
back
some
day
;
but
there
be
little
promise
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
town
be
placard
with
reference
to
the
Dullborough
Mechanics
'
institution
,
I
think
I
would
go
and
look
at
that
establishment
next
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
such
thing
in
the
town
,
in
my
young
day
,
and
it
occur
to
me
that
its
extreme
prosperity
may
have
bring
adversity
upon
the
Drama
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
institution
with
some
difficulty
,
and
should
scarcely
have
know
that
I
have
find
it
if
I
have
judge
from
its
external
appearance
only
;
but
this
be
attributable
to
its
never
have
be
finish
,
and
have
no
front
:
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
it
lead
a
modest
and
retired
existence
up
a
stable
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
(
as
I
learn
,
on
inquiry
)
a
most
flourishing
institution
,
and
of
the
high
benefit
to
the
town
:
 
<EOS>
two
triumph
which
I
be
glad
to
understand
be
not
at
all
impair
by
the
seeming
drawback
that
no
mechanic
belong
to
it
,
and
that
it
be
steep
in
debt
to
the
chimney
-
pot
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
a
large
room
,
which
be
approach
by
an
infirm
step
-
ladder
:
 
the
builder
have
decline
to
construct
the
intended
staircase
,
without
a
present
payment
in
cash
,
which
Dullborough
(
though
profoundly
appreciative
of
the
Institution
)
<EOS>
seem
unaccountably
bashful
about
subscribe
.
 
<EOS>
the
large
room
have
cost
---
or
would
,
when
pay
for
---
five
hundred
pound
;
and
it
have
more
mortar
in
it
and
more
echo
,
than
one
may
have
expect
to
get
for
the
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
fit
up
with
a
platform
,
and
the
usual
lecturing
tool
,
include
a
large
black
board
of
a
menacing
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
on
refer
to
list
of
the
course
of
lecture
that
have
be
give
in
this
thrive
Hall
,
I
fancy
I
detect
a
shyness
in
admit
that
human
nature
when
at
leisure
have
any
desire
whatever
to
be
relieve
and
divert
;
and
a
furtive
slide
in
of
any
poor
make
-
weight
piece
of
amusement
,
shame
-
facedly
and
edgewise
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
I
observe
that
it
be
necessary
for
the

to
be
knock
on
the
head
with
Gas
,
Air
,
Water
,
Food

<EOS>
likewise
,
that
they
must
be
stun
by
a
weighty
inquiry
whether
there
be
internal
evidence
in
Shakespeare

to
prove
that

<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
the
masking

and
pretend
it
be
something
else
---
as

that
they

even
in

in

to
put

<EOS>
one
very
agreeable

who

there
be
such
a
painfully
apologetic

of
62

who
have
read
Travels

Popular

and
mere

descriptive
of
the

and
such
an

I

<EOS>
emerge
from
the
Mechanics
'
institution
and
continue
my
walk
about
the
town
,
I
still
notice
everywhere
the
prevalence
,
to
an
extraordinary
degree
,
of
this
custom
of
put
the
natural
demand
for
amusement
out
of
sight
,
as
some
untidy
housekeeper
put
dust
,
and
pretend
that
it
be
sweep
away
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
minister
to
,
in
a
dull
and
abortive
manner
,
by
all
who
make
this
feint
.
<EOS>
look
in
at
what
be
call
in
Dullborough
"
the
serious
bookseller
's
,
"
where
,
in
my
childhood
,
I
have
study
the
face
of
number
of
gentleman
depict
in
rostrum
with
a
gaslight
on
each
side
of
them
,
and
cast
my
eye
over
the
open
page
of
certain
print
discourse
there
,
I
find
a
vast
deal
of
aim
at
jocosity
and
dramatic
effect
,
even
in
them
---
yes
,
verily
,
even
on
the
part
of
one
very
wrathful
expounder
who
bitterly
anathematise
a
poor
little
Circus
.
 
<EOS>
similarly
,
in
the
reading
provide
for
the
young
people
enrol
in
the
Lasso
of
Love
,
and
other
excellent
union
,
I
find
the
writer
generally
under
a
distressing
sense
that
they
must
start
(
at
all
event
)
like
story
-
teller
,
and
delude
the
young
person
into
the
belief
that
they
be
go
to
be
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
look
in
at
this
window
for
twenty
minute
by
the
clock
,
I
be
in
a
position
to
offer
a
friendly
remonstrance
---
not
bear
on
this
particular
point
---
to
the
designer
and
engraver
of
the
picture
in
those
publication
.
 
<EOS>
have
they
consider
the
awful
consequence
likely
to
flow
from
their
representation
of
Virtue
?
 
<EOS>
have
they
ask
themselves
the
question
,
whether
the
terrific
prospect
of
acquire
that
fearful
chubbiness
of
head
,
unwieldiness
of
arm
,
feeble
dislocation
of
leg
,
crispiness
of
hair
,
and
enormity
of
shirt
-
collar
,
which
they
represent
as
inseparable
from
Goodness
,
may
not
tend
to
confirm
sensitive
waverer
,
in
Evil
?
 
<EOS>
a
most
impressive
example
(
if
I
have
believe
it
)
of
what
a
Dustman
and
a
Sailor
may
come
to
,
when
they
mend
their
way
,
be
present
to
me
in
this
same
shop
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
lean
(
they
be
intimate
friend
)
against
a
post
,
drunk
and
reckless
,
with
surpassingly
bad
hat
on
,
and
their
hair
over
their
forehead
,
they
be
rather
picturesque
,
and
look
as
if
they
may
be
agreeable
man
,
if
they
would
not
be
beast
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
they
have
get
over
their
bad
propensity
,
and
when
,
as
a
consequence
,
their
head
have
swell
alarmingly
,
their
hair
have
get
so
curly
that
it
lift
their
blow
-
out
cheek
up
,
their
coat
-
cuff
be
so
long
that
they
never
could
do
any
work
,
and
their
eye
be
so
wide
open
that
they
never
could
do
any
sleep
,
they
present
a
spectacle
calculate
to
plunge
a
timid
nature
into
the
depth
of
Infamy
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
the
clock
that
have
so
degenerate
since
I
see
it
last
,
admonish
me
that
I
have
stay
here
long
enough
;
and
I
resume
my
walk
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
go
fifty
pace
along
the
street
when
I
be
suddenly
bring
up
by
the
sight
of
a
man
who
get
out
of
a
little
phaeton
at
the
doctor
's
door
,
and
go
into
the
doctor
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
,
the
air
be
fill
with
the
scent
of
trodden
grass
,
and
the
perspective
of
year
open
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
be
a
little
likeness
of
this
man
keep
a
wicket
,
and
I
say
,
"
God
bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
Joe
Specks
!
"
   
<EOS>
through
many
change
and
much
work
,
I
have
preserve
a
tenderness
for
the
memory
of
Joe
,
forasmuch
as
we
have
make
the
acquaintance
of
Roderick
Random
together
,
and
have
believe
him
to
be
no
ruffian
,
but
an
ingenuous
and
engage
hero
.
 
<EOS>
scorn
to
ask
the
boy
leave
in
the
phaeton
whether
it
be
really
Joe
,
and
scorn
even
to
read
the
brass
plate
on
the
door
---
so
sure
be
I
<EOS>
---
I
ring
the
bell
and
inform
the
servant
maid
that
a
stranger
seek
audience
of
Mr
Specks
.
 
<EOS>
into
a
room
,
half
surgery
,
half
study
,
I
be
show
to
await
his
coming
,
and
I
find
it
,
by
a
series
of
elaborate
accident

bestrew
with
testimony
to

<EOS>
when
my
old
schoolfellow
come
in
,
and
I
inform
him
with
a
smile
that
I
be
not
a
patient
,
he
seem
rather
at
a
loss
to
perceive
any
reason
for
smile
in
connexion
with
that
fact

and
inquire
to
what

the

I
ask

with

smile
,
could
he
remember
me
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
(
he
say
)
<EOS>
that
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
have
but
<EOS>
a
poor
opinion
of
Mr
Specks
,
when
he
say
reflectively
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
a
something
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
I
see
a
boyish
light
in
his
eye
that
look
well
,
and
I
ask
him
if
he
could
inform
me
,
as
a
stranger
who
desire
to
know
and
have
not
the
mean
of
reference
at
hand
,
what
the
name
of
the
young
lady
be
,
who
marry
Mr
Random
?
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
he
say
"
Narcissa
,
"
and
,
after
stare
for
a
moment
,
call
me
by
my
name
,
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
and
melt
into
a
roar
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
of
course
,
you
will
remember
Lucy
Green
,
"
he
say
,
after
we
have
talk
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
whom
do
you
think
she
marry
?
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
?
<EOS>
"
I
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Me
,
"
say
speck
,
"
and
you
shall
see
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
see
her
,
and
she
be
fat
,
and
if
all
the
hay
in
the
world
have
be
heap
upon
her
,
it
could
scarcely
have
alter
her
face
more
than
Time
have
alter
it
from
my
remembrance
of
the
face
that
have
once
look
down
upon
me
into
the
fragrant
dungeon
of
Seringapatam
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
her
young
child
come
in
after
dinner
(
for
I
dine
with
them
,
and
we
have
no
other
company
than
Specks
,
Junior
,
Barrister
-
at

law
,
who
go
away
as
soon
as
the
cloth
be
remove
,
to
look
after
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
be
go

,
I
see
again
,
in
that
little
daughter
,
the
little
face
of
the
hayfield
,
unchanged
,
and
it
quite
touch
my
foolish
heart
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
immensely
,
Specks
and
Mrs
Specks
,
and
I
,
and
we
speak
of
our
old
self
as
though
our
old
self
be
dead
and
go
,
and
indeed
,
indeed
they
be
---
dead
and
go
as
the
playing
-
field
that
have
become
a
wilderness
of
rusty
iron
,
and
the
property
of

<EOS>
speck
,
however
,
illuminate
Dullborough
with
the
ray
of
interest
that
I
want
and
should
otherwise
have
miss
in
it
,
and
link
its
present
to
its
past
,
with
a
highly
agreeable
chain
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
Specks
's
society
I
have
new
occasion
to
observe
what
I
have
before
notice
in
similar
communication
among
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
schoolfellow
and
other
of
old
,
whom
I
inquire
about
,
have
either
do
superlatively
well
or
superlatively
ill
---
have
either
become
uncertificated
bankrupt
,
or
be
felonious
and
get
themselves
transport
;
or
have
make
great
hit
in
life
,
and
do
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
so
commonly
the
case
,
that
I
never
can
imagine
what
become
of
all
the
mediocre
people
of
people
's
youth
---
especially
consider
that
we
find
no
lack
of
the
specie
in
our
maturity
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
do
not
propound
this
difficulty
to
Specks
,
for
no
pause
in
the
conversation
<EOS>
give
me
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
nor
,
could
I
discover
one
single
flaw
in
the
good
doctor
---
when
he
read
this
,
he
will
receive
in
a
friendly
spirit
the
pleasantly
mean
record
---
except
that
he
have
forget
his
Roderick
Random
,
and
that
he
confound
Strap
with
Lieutenant
Hatchway
;
who
never
know
Random
,
howsoever
intimate
with
Pickle
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
go
alone
to
the
Railway
to
catch
my
train
at
night
(
speck
have
mean
to
go
with
me
,
but
be
inopportunely
call
out
)
,
I
be
in
a
more
charitable
mood
with
Dullborough
than
I
have
be
all
day
;
and
yet
in
my
heart
I
have
love
it
all

too

<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
who
be
I
that
I
should
quarrel
with

change
to
me

when
I
myself
have
come
back

so
change

to
it

<EOS>
all
my
early
reading
and
early
imagination
date
from
this
place
,
and
<EOS>
I
take
them
away
so
full
of
innocent
construction
and
guileless
belief
,
and
I
bring
them
back
so
worn
and
torn

so
much

so
much
the
bad

Night
Walks
 
<EOS>
some
year
ago
,
a
temporary
inability
to
sleep
,
referable
to
a
distressing
impression
,
cause
me
to
walk
about
the

all
night
,
for
a
series
of
several
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
disorder
may
have
take
a
long
time
to
conquer
,
if
it
have
be
faintly
experiment
on
in
bed
;
but
,
it
be
soon
defeat
by
the
brisk
treatment
of
get
up
directly
after
lie
down
,
and
go
out
,
and
come
home
tired
at
sunrise
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
those
night
,
I
finish
my
education
in
a
fair
amateur
experience
of
houselessness
.
 
<EOS>
My
principal
object
be
to
get
through
the
night
,
the
pursuit
of
it
bring
me
into
sympathetic
relation
with
people
who
have
no
other
object
every
night
in
the

<EOS>
the
month
be
March
,
and
the
weather
damp
,
cloudy
,
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
not
rise
before
half
-
past
five
,
the
night
perspective
look
sufficiently
long
at
half
-
past
twelve
:
 
which
be
about
my
time
for
confront
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
restlessness
of
a
great
city
,
and
the
way
in
which
it
tumble
and
toss
before
it
can
get
to
sleep
,
form
one
of
the
first
entertainment
offer
to
the
contemplation
of
us
houseless
people
.
<EOS>
It
last
about
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
We
lose
a
great
deal
of
companionship
when
the
late
public
-
house
turn
their
lamp
out
,
and
when
the
potman
thrust
the
last
brawling
drunkard
into
the
street
;
but
stray
vehicle
and
stray
people
be
leave
us
,
after
that
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
be
very
lucky
,
a
policeman
's
rattle
sprang
and
a
fray
turn
up
;
but
,
in
general
,
surprisingly
little
of
this
diversion
be
provide
.
 
<EOS>
except
in
the
Haymarket
,
which
be
the
worst
keep
part
of
London
,
and
about
Kent
-
street
in
the
Borough
,
and
along
a
portion
of
the
line
of
the
Old
Kent
-
road
,
the
peace
be
seldom
violently
break
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
always
the
case
that
London
,
as
if
in
imitation
of
individual
citizen
belong
to
it
,
have
expire
fit
and
start
of
restlessness
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
seem
quiet
,
if
one
cab
rattle
by
,
half
-
a
-
dozen
would
surely
follow
;
and
Houselessness
even
observe
that
intoxicate
people
appear
to
be
magnetically
attract
towards
each
other
;
so
that
we
know
when
we
see
one
drunken
object
staggering
against
the
shutter
of
a
shop
,
that
another
drunken
object
would
stagger
up
before
five
minute
be
out
,
to
fraternise
or
fight
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
make
a
divergence
from
the
regular
specie
of
drunkard
,
the
thin
-
armed
,
puff
-
face
,
leaden
-
lip
gin
-
drinker
,
and
encounter
a
rarer
speciman
of
a
more
decent
appearance
,
fifty
to
one
but
that
speciman
be
dress
in
soil
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
street
experience
in
the
night
,
so
the
street
experience
in
the
day
;
the
common
folk
who
come
unexpectedly
into
a
little
property
,
come
unexpectedly
into
a
deal
of
liquor
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
these
flicker
spark
would
die
away
,
wear
out
---
<EOS>
the
last
veritable
spark
of
wake
life
trail
from
some
late
pieman
or
hot
-
potato
man
---
and
London
would
sink
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
yearning
of
the
houseless
mind
would
be
for
any
sign
of
company
,
any
lighted
place
,
any
movement
,
anything
suggestive
of
any
one
be
up
---
<EOS>
nay
,
even
so
much
as
awake
,
for
the
houseless
eye
look
out
for
light
in
window
.
   
<EOS>
walk
the
street
under
the
patter
rain
,
Houselessness
would
walk
and
walk
and
walk
,
see
nothing
but
the
interminable
tangle
of
street
,
save
at
a
corner
,
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
two
policeman
in
conversation
,
or
the
sergeant
or
inspector
look
after
his
man
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
in
the
night
---
but
<EOS>
rarely
---
Houselessness
would
become
aware
of
a
furtive
head
peer
out
of
a
doorway
a
few
yard
before
him
,
and
,
come
up
with
the
head
,
would
find
a
man
stand
bolt
upright
to
keep
within
the
doorway
's
shadow
,
and
evidently
intent
upon
no
particular
service
to
society
.
 
<EOS>
under
a
kind
of
fascination
,
and
in
a
ghostly
silence
suitable
to
the
time
,
Houselessness
and
this
gentleman
would
eye
one
another
from
head
to
foot
,
and
so
,
without
exchange
of
speech
,
part
,
mutually
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
Drip
,
drip
,
drip
,
from
ledge
and
coping
,
splash
from
pipe
and
water
-
spout
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
the
houseless
shadow
would
fall
upon
the
stone
that
pave
the
way
to
Waterloo
-
bridge
;
it
be
in
the
houseless
mind
to
have
a
halfpenny
worth
of
excuse
for
say
"
good
-
night
"
to
the
toll
-
keeper
,
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
fire
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
fire
and
a
good
great
-
coat
and
a
good
woollen
neck
-
shawl
,
be
comfortable
thing
to
see
in
conjunction
with
the
toll
-
keeper
;
also
his
brisk
wakefulness
be
excellent
company
when
he
rattle
the
change
of
halfpence
down
upon
that
metal
table
of
his
,
like
a
man
who
defy
the
night
,
with
all
its
sorrowful
thought
,
and
do
not
care
for
the
coming
of
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
need
of
encouragement
on
the
threshold
of
the
bridge
,
for
the
bridge
be
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
the
chop
-
up
murdered
man
,
have
not
be
lower
with
a
rope
over
the
parapet
when
those
night
be
;
he
be
alive
,
and
sleep
then
quietly
enough
most
likely
,
and
undisturbed
by
any
dream
of
where
he
be
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
river
have
an
awful
look
,
the
building
on
the
bank
be
muffle
in
black
shroud
,
and
the
reflect
light
seem
to
originate
deep
in
the
water
,
as
if
the
spectre
of
suicide
be
hold
them
to
show
where
they
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
wild
moon
and
cloud
be
as
restless
as
an
evil
conscience
in
a
tumble
bed
,
and
the
very
shadow
of
the
immensity
of
London
seem
to
lie
oppressively
upon
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
between
the
bridge
and
the
two
great
theatre
,
there
be
but
the
distance
of
a
few
hundred
pace
,
so
the
theatre
come
next
.
 
<EOS>
Grim
and
black
within
,
at
night
,
those
great
dry
Wells
,
and
lonesome
to
imagine
,
with
the
row
of
face
fade
out
,
the
light
extinguish
,
and
the
seat
all
empty
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
think
that
nothing
in
them
know
itself
at
such
a
time
<EOS>
but
Yorick
's
skull
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
my
night
walk
,
as
the
church
steeple
be
shake
the
March
wind
and
rain
with
the
stroke
of
four
,
I
pass
the
outer
boundary
of
one
of
these
great
desert
,
and
enter
it
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
dim
lantern
in
my
hand
,
I
grope
my
well
-
know
way
to
the
stage
and
look
over
the
orchestra
---
which
be
like
<EOS>
a
great
grave
dug
for
a
time
of
pestilence
---
into
the
void
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
a
dismal
cavern
of
an
immense
aspect
,
with
the
chandelier
go
dead
like
everything
else
,
and
nothing
visible
through
mist
and
fog
and
space
,
but
tier
of
winding
-
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
at
my
foot
where
,
when
last
there
,
I
have
see
the
peasantry
of
Naples
dance
among
the
vine
,
reckless
of
the
burn
mountain
which
threaten
to
overwhelm
them
,
be
now
in
possession
of
a
strong
serpent
of
engine
-
hose
,
watchfully
lie
in
wait
for
the
serpent
fire
,
and
ready
to
fly
at
it
if
it
show
its
fork
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
a
ghost
of
a
watchman
,
carry
a
faint
corpse
candle
,
haunt
the
distant
upper
gallery
and
flit
away
.
<EOS>
retire
within
the
proscenium
,
and
hold
my
light
above
my
head
towards
the
roll
-
up
curtain
---
green
no
more
,
but
black
as
ebony
---
my
sight
lose
itself
in
a
gloomy
vault
,
show
faint
indication
in
it
of
a
shipwreck
of
canvas
and
cordage
.
 
<EOS>
Methought
<EOS>
I
feel
much
as
a
diver
may
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
in
those
small
hour
when
there
be
no
movement
in
the
street
,
it
afford
matter
for
reflection
to
take
Newgate
in
the
way
,
and
,
touch
its
rough
stone
,
to
think
of
the
prisoner
in
their
sleep
,
and
then
to
glance
in
at
the
lodge
over
the
spiked
wicket
,
and
see
the
fire
and
light
of
the
watch
turnkey
,
on
the
white
wall
.
<EOS>
not
an
inappropriate
time
either
,
to
linger
by
that
wicked
little
Debtors
'
Door
---
shut
tight
than
any
other
door
one
ever
see
---
which
have
be
death
's
door
to
so
many
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
day
of
the
uttering
of
forge
one
-
pound
note
by
people
tempt
up
from
the
country
,
how
many
hundred
of
wretched
creature
of
both
sex
---
many
quite
innocent
---
swing
out
of
a
pitiless
and
inconsistent
world
,
with
the
tower
of
yonder
christian
church
of
Saint
Sepulchre
monstrously
before
their
eye
!
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
haunting
of
the
Bank
Parlour
,
by
the
remorseful
soul
of
old
director
,
in
the
night
of
these
later
day
,
I
wonder
,
or
be
it
as
quiet
as
this
degenerate
Aceldama
of
an
Old
Bailey
?
   
<EOS>
to
walk
on
to
the
Bank
,
lament
the
good
old
time
and
bemoan
the
present
evil
period
,
would
be
an
easy
next
step
,
so
I
would
take
it
,
and
would
make
my
houseless
circuit
of
the
Bank
,
and
give
a
thought
to
the
treasure
within
;
likewise
to
the
guard
of
soldier
pass
the
night
there
,
and
nod
over
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
next
,
I
go
to
Billingsgate
,
in
some
hope
of
market
-
people
,
but
it
prove
as
yet
too
early
,
cross
London
-
bridge
and
get
down
by
the
water
-
side
on
the
Surrey
shore
among
the
building
of
the
great
brewery
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
go
on
at
the
brewery
;
and
the
reek
,
and
the
smell
of
grain
,
and
the
rattling
of
the
plump
dray
horse
at
their
manger
,
be
capital
company
.
 
<EOS>
quite
refresh
by
have
mingle
with
this
good
society
,
I
make
a
new
start
with
a
new
heart
,
set
the
old
King
's
Bench
prison
before
me
for
my
next
object
,
and
resolve
,
when
I
should
come
to
the
wall
,
to
think
of
poor
Horace
Kinch
,
and
the
Dry
Rot
in
man
.
   
<EOS>
a
very
curious
disease
the
Dry
Rot
in
man
,
and
difficult
to
detect
the
beginning
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
carry
Horace
Kinch
inside
the
wall
of
the
old
King
's
Bench
prison
,
and
it
have
carry
him
out
with
his
foot
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
likely
man
to
look
at
,
in
the
prime
of
life
,
well
to
do
,
as
clever
as
he
need
to
be
,
and
popular
among
many
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
suitably
married
,
and
have
healthy
and
pretty
child
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
like
some
fair
-
look
house
or
fair
-
looking
ship
,
he
take
the
Dry
Rot
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
strong
external
revelation
of
the
Dry
Rot
in
man
,
be
a
tendency
to
lurk
and
lounge
;
to
be
at
street
-
corner
without
intelligible
reason
;
to
be
go
anywhere
when
meet
;
to
be
about
many
place
rather
than
at
any
;
to
do
nothing
tangible
,
but
to
have
an
intention
of
perform
a
variety
of
intangible
duty
to
-
morrow
or
the
day
after
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
manifestation
of
the
disease
be
observe
,
the
observer
will
usually
connect
it
with
a
vague
impression
once
form
or
receive
,
that
the
patient
be
live
a
little
too
hard
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
scarcely
have
have
leisure
to
turn
it
over
in
his
mind
and
form
the
terrible
suspicion
"
Dry
Rot
,
"
when
he
will
notice
a
change
for
the
bad
in
the
patient
's
appearance
:
 
a
certain
slovenliness
and
deterioration
,
which
be
not
poverty
,
nor
dirt
,
nor
intoxication
,
nor
ill
-
health
,
but
simply
Dry
Rot
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
succeed
a
smell
as
of
strong
water
,
in
the
morning
;
to
that
,
a
looseness
respect
money
;
to
that
,
a
strong
smell
as
of
strong
water
,
at
all
time
;
to
that
,
a
looseness
respect
everything
;
to
that
,
a
trembling
of
the
limb
,
somnolency
,
misery
,
and
crumble
to
piece
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
in
wood
,
so
it
be
in
man
.
 
<EOS>
Dry
Rot
advance
at
a
compound
usury
quite
incalculable
.
 
<EOS>
a
plank
be
find
infect
with
it
,
and
the
whole
structure
be
devote
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
have
be
with
the
unhappy
Horace
Kinch
,
lately
bury
by
a
small
subscription
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
know
him
have
not
nigh
do
say
,
"
so
well
off
,
so
comfortably
establish
,
with
such
hope
before
him
---
and
yet
,
it
be
fear
,
with
a
slight
touch
of
Dry
Rot
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
lo
!
<EOS>
the
man
be
all
Dry
Rot
and
dust

<EOS>
from
the
dead
wall
associate
on
those
houseless
night
with
this
too
common
story
,
I
choose
next
to
wander
by
Bethlehem
Hospital
;
partly
,
because
it
lie
on
my
road
round
to
Westminster
;
partly
,
because
I
have
a
night
fancy
in
my
head
which
could
be
best
pursued
within
sight
of
its
wall
and
dome
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
fancy
be
this
:
 
be
not
the
sane
and
the
insane
equal
at
night
as
the
sane
lie
a
dreaming
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
all
of
us
outside
this
hospital
,
who
dream
,
more
or
less
in
the
condition
of
those
inside
it
,
every
night
of
our
life
?
 
<EOS>
be
we
not
nightly
persuade
,
as
they
daily
be
,
that
we
associate
preposterously
with
king
and
queen
,
emperor
and
empress
,
and
notability
of
all
sort
?
 
<EOS>
do
we
not
nightly
jumble
event
and
personage
and
time
and
place
,
as
these
do
daily
?
 
<EOS>
be
we
not
sometimes
trouble
by
our
own
sleeping
inconsistency
,
and
do
we
not
vexedly
try
to
account
for
them
or
excuse
them
,
just
as
these
do
sometimes
in
respect
of
their
wake
delusion
?
 
<EOS>
say
an
afflict
man
to
me
,
when
I
be
last
in
a
hospital
like
this
,
"
Sir
,
I
can
frequently
fly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
half
ashamed
to
reflect
that
<EOS>
so
<EOS>
could
I
---
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
say
a
woman
to
me
on
the
same
occasion
<EOS>
,
"
Queen
Victoria
frequently
come
to
dine
with
me
,
and
her
Majesty
and
I
dine
off
peach
and
maccaroni
in
our
night
-
gown
,
and
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
Consort
do
us
the
honour
to
make
a
third
on
horseback
in
a
Field
-
Marshal
's
uniform
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Could
I
refrain
from
redden
with
consciousness
when
I
remember
the
amazing
royal
party
I
myself
have
give
(
at
night
)
,
<EOS>
the
unaccountable
viand
I
have
put
on
table
,
and
my
extraordinary
manner
of
conduct
myself
on
those
distinguished
occasion
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
that
the
great
master
who
know
everything
,
when
he
call
sleep
the
death

Dreams
the

<EOS>
by
this
time
I
have
leave
the
Hospital
behind
me
,
and
be
again
set
towards
the
river
;
and
in
a
short
breathing
space
I
be
on
Westminster
-
bridge
,
regale
my
houseless
eye
with
the
external
wall
of
the
British
Parliament
---
<EOS>
the
perfection
of
a
stupendous
institution
,
I
know
,
and
the
admiration
of
all
surround
nation
and
succeed
age
,
I
do
not
doubt
,
but
perhaps
a
little
the
well
now
and
then
for
be
prick
up
to
its
work
.
 
<EOS>
turn
off
into
Old
Palace
-
yard
,
the
Courts
of
Law
keep
me
company
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
hint
in
low
whisper
what
number
of
people
they
be
keep
awake
,
and
how
intensely
wretched
and
horrible
they
be
render
the
small
hour
to
unfortunate
suitor
.
<EOS>
Westminster
Abbey
be
fine
gloomy
society
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
;
suggest
a
wonderful
procession
of
its
dead
among
the
dark
arch
and
pillar
,
each
century
more
amazed
by
the
century
follow
it
than
by
all
the
century
go
before
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
in
those
houseless
night
walk
---
which
even
include
cemetery
where
watchmen
go
round
among
the
grave
at
stated
time
,
and
move
the
tell
-
tale
handle
of
an
index
which
record
that
they
have
touch
it
at
such
an
hour
<EOS>
---
it
be
a
solemn
consideration
what
enormous
host
of
dead
belong
to
one
old
great
city
,
and
how
,
if
they
be
raise
while
the
living
sleep
,
there
would
not
be
the
space
of
a
pin
's
point
in
all
the
street
and
way
for
the
living
to
come
out
into
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
that
,
but
the
vast
army
of
dead
would
overflow
the
hill
and
valley
beyond
the
city
,
and
would
stretch
away
all
round
it
,
God
know
how
far
.
   
<EOS>
when
a
church
clock
strike
,
on
houseless
ear
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
it
may
be
at
first
mistake
for
company
and
hail
as
such
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
spread
circle
of
vibration
,
which
you
may
perceive
at
such
a
time
with
great
clearness
,
go
open
out
,
for
ever
and
ever
afterwards
widen
perhaps
(
as
the
philosopher
have
suggest
)
in
eternal
space
,
the
mistake
be
rectify
and
the
sense
of
loneliness
be
profounder
.
 
<EOS>
once
---
it
be
after
leave
the
Abbey
and
turn
my
face
north
---
I
come
to
the
great
step
of
St
Martin
's
church
as
the
clock
be
strike
three
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
a
thing
that
in
a
moment
more
I
should
have
tread
upon
without
see
,
rise
up
at
my
foot
with
a
cry
of
loneliness
and
houselessness
,
strike
out
of
it
by
the
bell
,
the
like
of
which
I
never
hear
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
stand
face
to
face
look
at
one
another
,
frighten
by
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
creature
be
like
a
beetle
-
browe
hair
-
lip
youth
of
twenty
,
and
it
have
a
loose
bundle
of
rag
on
,
which
it
hold
together
with
one
of
its
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
shiver
from
head
to
foot
,
and
its
tooth
chatter
,
and
as
it
stare
at
me
---
persecutor
,
devil
,
ghost
,
<EOS>
whatever
it
think
me
---
it
make
with
its
whining
mouth
as
if
it
be
snap
at
me
,
like
a
worried
dog
.
 
<EOS>
intend
to
give
this
ugly
object
money
,
I
put
out
my
hand
to
stay
it
---
for
it
recoil
as
it
whine
and
snap
---
and
lay
my
hand
upon
its
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
instantly
,
it
twist
out
of
its
garment
,
like
the
young
man
in
the
New
Testament
,
and
leave
me
stand
alone
with
its
rag
in
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
covent
-
garden
market
,
when
it
be
market
morning
,
be
wonderful
company
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
waggon
of
cabbage
,
with
grower
'
man
and
boy
lie
asleep
under
them
,
and
with
sharp
dog
from
market
-
garden
neighbourhood
look
after
the
whole
,
be
as
good
as
a
party
.
<EOS>
but
one
of
the
bad
night
sight
I
know
in
London
,
be
to
be
find
in
the
child
who
prowl
about
this
place
;
who
sleep
in
the
basket
,
fight
for
the
offal
,
dart
at
any
object
they
think
they
can
lay
their
their
thieving
hand
on
,
dive
under
the
cart
and
barrow
,
dodge
the
constable
,
and
be
perpetually
make
a
blunt
pattering
on
the
pavement
of
the
Piazza
with
the
rain
of
their
naked
foot
.
 
<EOS>
a
painful
and
unnatural
result
come
of
the
comparison
one
be
force
to
institute
between
the
growth
of
corruption
as
display
in
the
so
much
improved
and
care
for
fruit
of
the
earth
,
and
the
growth
of
corruption
as
display
in
these
all
uncared
for

except
inasmuch
as
ever

hunt
)
savage
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
early
coffee
to
be
get
about
covent

garden
market
,
and
that
be
more
company
---
warm
company
,
too
,
which
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
Toast
of
a
very
substantial
quality
,
be
likewise
procurable
:
 
though
the
towzle

head
man
who
make
it
,
in
an
inner
chamber
within
the
coffee

room
,
have
not
get
his
coat
on
yet
,
and
be
so
heavy
with
sleep
that
in
every
interval
of
toast
and
coffee
he
go
off
anew
behind
the
partition
into
complicated
cross

road
of
choke
and
snore
,
and
lose
his
way
directly
.
 
<EOS>
into
one
of
these
establishment
(
among
the
early
)
near
Bow
-
street
,
there
come
one
morning
as
I
sit
over
my
houseless
cup
,
ponder
where
to
go
next
,
a
man
in
a
high
and
long
snuff
-
colour
coat
,
and
shoe
,
and
,
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
nothing
else
but
a
hat
,
who
take
out
of
his
hat
a
large
cold
meat
pudding
;
a
meat
pudde
so
large
that
it
be
a
very
tight
fit
,
and
bring
the
lining
of
the
hat
out
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
mysterious
man
be
know
by
his
pudding
,
for
on
his
entering
,
the
man
of
sleep
bring
him
a
pint
of
hot
tea
,
a
small
loaf
,
and
a
large
knife
and
fork
and
plate
.
 
<EOS>
left
to
himself
in
his
box
,
he
stand
the
pudding
on
the
bare
table
,
and
,
instead
of
cut
it
,
stab
it
,
overhand
,
with
the
knife
,
like
a
mortal
enemy
;
then
take
the
knife
out
,
wipe
it
on
his
sleeve
,
tear
the
pudding
asunder
with
his
finger
,
and
eat
it
all
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
this
man
with
the
pudding
remain
with
me
as
the
remembrance
of
the
most
spectral
person
my
houselessness
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
twice
only
be
I
in
that
establishment
,
and
twice
I
see
him
stalk
in
(
as
I
should
say
,
just
out
of
bed
,
and
presently
go
back
to
bed
)
,
take
out
his
pudding
,
stab
his
pudding
,
wipe
the
dagger
,
and
eat
his
pudding
all
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
whose
figure
promise
cadaverousness
,
but
who
have
an
excessively
red
face
,
though
shape
like
a
horse
's
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
second
occasion
of
my
see
him
,
he
say
huskily
to
the
man
of
sleep
,
"
be
I
red
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
,
"
he
uncompromisingly
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
mother
,
"
say
the
spectre
,
"
be
a
red
-
faced
woman
that
like
drink
,
and
I
look
at
her
hard
when
she
lay
in
her
coffin
,
and
I
take
the
complexion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
somehow
,
the
pudding
seem
an
unwholesome
pudding
after
that
,
and
I
put
myself
in
its
way
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
when
there
be
no
market
,
or
when
I
want
variety
,
a
railway
terminus
with
the
morning
mail
come
in
,
be
remunerative
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
like
most
of
the
company
to
be
have
in
this
world
,
it
last
only
a
very
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
station
lamp
would
burst
out
ablaze
,
the
porter
would
emerge
from
place
of
concealment
,
the
cab
and
truck
would
rattle
to
their
place
(
the
post
-
office
cart
be
already
in
theirs
)
,
and
,
finally
,
the
bell
would
strike
up
,
and
the
train
would
come
bang
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
few
passenger
and
little
luggage
,
and
<EOS>
everything
scuttle
away
with
the
great
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
the
locomotive
post
-
office
,
with
their
great
net
---
as
if
they
have
be
drag
the
country
for
body
---
would
fly
open
as
to
their
door
,
and
would
disgorge
a
smell
of
lamp
,
an
exhausted
clerk
,
a
guard
in
a
red
coat
,
and
their
bag
of
letter
;
the
engine
would
blow
and
heave
and
perspire
,
like
an
engine
wipe
its
forehead
and
say
what
a
run
it
have
have
;
and
within
ten
minute
the
lamp
be
out
,
and
I
be
houseless
and
alone
again
.
   
<EOS>
but
now
,
there
be
drive
cattle
on
the
high
road
near
,
want
(
as
cattle
always
do
)
to
turn
into
the
midst
of
stone
wall
,
and
squeeze
themselves
through
six
inch
'
width
of
iron
railing
,
and
get
their
head
down
(
also
as
cattle
always
do
)
for
tossing
-
purchase
at
quite
imaginary
dog
,
and
give
themselves
and
every
devoted
creature
associate
with
them
a
most
extraordinary
amount
of
unnecessary
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
too
,
the
conscious
gas
begin
to
grow
pale
with
the
knowledge
that
daylight
be
come
,
and
straggle
workpeople
be
already
in
the
street
,
and
,
as
wake
life
have
become
extinguish
with
the
last
pieman

so
it
begin
to

rekindle
with

<EOS>
and
so
by
fast
and
fast
degree
,
until
the
last
degree
be
very
fast
,
the
day
come
,
and
I
be
tired
and
could
sleep

<EOS>
and
it
be
not
,
as
I
use
to
think

go
home
at
such

<EOS>
the
least
wonderful
thing
in
London

that
in
the
real
desert
region
of
the
night
,
the
houseless
wanderer
be
alone
there

<EOS>
I
know
well
enough
where
to
find
Vice
and
Misfortune
of
all
kind
,
if
I
have
choose
;
but
they
be
put
out

my
houselessness
have
many

transact
some
business
with
a

occupy
a
highly
suicidal
set

Gray

Melancholy

my

<EOS>
I

as
be
natural

with
the
Chambers
I

<EOS>
They
be
an
upper

on
a
rotten

with
a
mysterious
bunk

outside

,
of

rather
nautical

Screw

otherwise

<EOS>
many
dusty

during

whole

of
live

it
have
be
hasp

padlock

<EOS>
I
can
not
quite
satisfy
my
mind
whether
it
be
originally
mean
for
the
reception
of
coal
,
or
body
,
or
as
a
place
of
temporary
security
for
the
plunder
"
loot
"
by
laundress

but
I
incline
to
the
last
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
breast
high

and
usually
serve
as
a
bulk
for
defendant
in
reduce
circumstance
to
lean

ponder
at
,
when
they
come
on
the
hopeful
errand
of
try

arrangement
without

under
which
auspicious
circumstance
it
mostly
happen
that
the
legal
gentleman
they
want

be
much
engaged
,
and
they
pervade
the

for
a
considerable

<EOS>
against

bulk

in
the
absurd
manner
,
the

at

that
in
exceptional
summer
weather
when
a
ray
of
sunlight
have
fall
on
the

in
my
presence

I
have
notice
its
inexpressive

be
deeply
mark
by
a
kind
of
bramah
erysipela
or
small

<EOS>
this
set
of
chamber
(

I

when
I
have

restless
occasion

make
inquiry

leave
message
,
after
office
hour

be
under
the
charge
of
a
lady
name
Sweeney
,
in
figure
extremely
like
an
old

umbrella

<EOS>
whose
dwelling
confront
a

Mrs

<EOS>
I
have
create
a
legend

consequently
I
believe
it
with
the

pertinacity
---
that
the
late
Mr
Sweeney
be
a
ticket
-
porter
under
the
honourable
Society
of
Gray

,
and
that
,
in
consideration
of
his
long

valuable
service

Mrs
Sweeney
be
appoint
to
her
present
post
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
though
devoid
of
personal
charm
,
I
have
observe
this
lady
to
exercise
a
fascination
over
the
elderly
ticker
-
porter
mind
(
particularly
under
the
gateway
,
and
in
corner
and
entry
)
,
which
I
can
only
refer
to
her
be
one
of
the
fraternity
,
yet
not
compete
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
nee
be
say
concern
this
set
of
chamber
,
be
say
,
when
I
have
add
that
it
be
in
a
large
double
house
in
Gray
's
Inn
-
square
,
very
much
out
of
repair
,
and
that
the
outer
portal
be
ornament
in
a
hideous
manner
with
certain
stone
remain
,
which
have
the
appearance
of
the
dismembered
bust
,
torso
,
and
limb
of
a
petrified
bencher
.
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
look
upon
Gray
's
Inn
generally
as
one
of
the
most
depressing
institution
in
brick
and
mortar
,
know
to
the
child
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
Can
anything
be
more
dreary
than
its
arid
Square
,
Sahara
Desert
of
the
law
,
with
the
ugly
old
tile
-
top
tenement
,
the
dirty
window
,
the

the

like
gravestone
,
the
crazy
gateway

upon
the
filthy
Lane

the
scowling

iron

bar
prison

like
passage
into
Verulam

,
the
mouldy
red

nosed

and
why
with

the
dry

atomy

like

of

whole

?
 
<EOS>
when
my
uncommercial
travel
tend
to
this
dismal
spot
,
my
comfort
be
its
rickety
state
.
 
<EOS>
imagination
gloat
over
the
fulness
of
time
when
the
staircase
shall
have
quite
tumble
down
<EOS>
---
they
be
daily
wear
into
an
ill

savour
powder
,
but
have
not
quite
tumble
down
yet
---
when
the
last
old
prolix
bencher
all
of
the
olden
time
,
<EOS>
shall
have
be
get
out
of
an
upper
window
by
mean
of
a
Fire
Ladder
,
and
carry
off
to
the
Holborn
Union
;
when
the
last
clerk
shall
have
engross
the
last
parchment
behind
the
last

on
the
last

the
mud

which
,
all
through
the
miry

be
pillory
out
of

in
Gray

lane
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
shall
a
squalid
little
trench
,
with
rank
grass
and
a
pump
in
it
,
lie
between
the
coffee

house
and
South

be
wholly
give
up

rat

and
not

as
now
,
have
its
empire
divide
between
those
animal

a

briefless
biped
---
surely
call
to
the
Bar
by
voice
of
deceive

,
see
that
they
be

by
no
mortal
---
who
glance
down
,
with
eye
better
glaze

from
their
dreary

lacklustre

.
 
<EOS>
then
shall
the
way
nor
<EOS>
"
Westward

now
lie
under
a
short
grim
colonnade
where
in
summer

stationere
window
into
the
eye
of
layman

be
choke
with

and
happily
become
impassable

<EOS>
then
shall
the
garden
where
turf
,
tree
,
and
gravel
wear
a
legal
livery
of
black
,
run
rank
,
and
pilgrim
go
to
Gorhambury
to
see
Bacon
's
effigy
as
he
sit
,
and
not
come
here
(
which
in
truth
they
seldom
do
)
to
see
where
he
walk
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
in
a
word
,
shall
the
old
-
established
vendor
of
periodical
sit
alone
in
his
little
crib
of
a
shop
behind
the
Holborn
Gate
,
like
that
lumber
Marius
among
the
ruin
of
Carthage
,
who
have
sit
heavy
on
a
thousand
million
of
simile
.
   
<EOS>
at
one
period
of
my
uncommercial
career
I
much
frequent
another
set
of
chamber
in
Gray
's
Inn
-
square
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
what
be
familiarly
call
"
a
top
set
,
"
and
all
the
eatable
and
drinkable
introduce
into
them
acquire
a
flavour
of
Cockloft
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
an
unopened
Strasbourg
pate
fresh
from
Fortnum
and
Mason
's
,
to
draw
in
this
cockloft
tone
through
its
crockery
dish
,
and
become
penetrate
with
cockloft
to
the
core
of
its
inmost
truffle
in
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
the
most
curious
feature
of
those
chamber
;
that
,
consist
in
the
profound
conviction
entertain
by
my
esteemed
friend
Parkle
(
their
tenant
)
that
they
be
clean
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
an
inborn
hallucination
,
or
whether
it
be
impart
to
him
by
Mrs
Miggot
<EOS>
the
laundress
,
I
never
could
ascertain
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
believe
he
would
have
go
to
the
stake
upon
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
they
be
so
dirty
that
I
could
take
off
the
distinct
impression
of
my
figure
on
any
article
of
furniture
by
merely
lounge
upon
it
for
a
few
moment
;
and
it
use
to
be
a
private
amusement
of
mine
to
print
myself
off
---
if
I
may
use
the
expression
---
all
over
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
large
circulation
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
I
have
accidentally
shake
a
window
curtain
while
in
animate
conversation
with
Parkle
,
and
struggle
insect
which
be
certainly
red
,
and
be
certainly
not
ladybird
,
have
drop
on
the
back
of
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
yet
Parkle
live
in
that
top
set
year
,
bind
body
and
soul
to
the
superstition
that
they
be
clean
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
say
,
when
congratulate
upon
them
,
"
well
,
they
be
not
like
chamber
in
one
respect
,
you
know
;
they
be
clean
.
"
 
<EOS>
concurrently
,
he
have
an
idea
which
he
could
never
explain
,
that
Mrs
Miggot
be
in
some
way
connect
with
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
in
particularly
good
spirit
,
he
use
to
believe
that
a
deceased
uncle
of
her
have
be
a
Dean
;
when
he
be
poorly
and
low
,
he
believe
that
her
brother
have
be
a
Curate
.
 
<EOS>
I
and
Mrs
Miggot
<EOS>
(
she
be
a
genteel
woman
)
be
on
confidential
term
,
but
I
never
know
her
to
commit
herself
to
any
distinct
assertion
on
the
subject
;
she
merely
claim
a
proprietorship
in
the
Church
,
by
look
when
it
be
mention
,
as
if
the
reference
awaken
the
slumbering
past
,
and
be
personal
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
his
amiable
confidence
in
Mrs
Miggot
's
well
day
that
inspire
my
friend
with
his
delusion
respect
the
chamber
,
but
he
never
waver
in
his
fidelity
to
it
for
a
moment
,
though
he
wallow
in
dirt
seven
year
.
   
<EOS>
two
of
the
window
of
these
chamber
look
down
into
the
garden
;
and
we
have
sit
up
there
together
many
a
summer
evening
,
say
how
pleasant
it
be
,
and
talk
of
many
thing
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
intimacy
with
that
top
set
,
I
be
indebte
for
three
of
my
lively
personal
impression
of
the
loneliness
of
life
in
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
follow
here
,
in
order
;
first
,
second
,
and
third
.
   
<EOS>
first
.
 
<EOS>
My
Gray
's
Inn
friend
,
on
a
time
,
hurt
one
of
his
leg
,
and
it
become
seriously
inflame
.
 
<EOS>
not
know
of
his
indisposition
,
I
be
on
my
way
to
visit
him
as
usual
,
one
summer
evening
,
when
I
be
much
surprised
by
meet
a
lively
leech
in
field
-
court
,
Gray
's
Inn
,
seemingly
on
his
way
to
the
West
End
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
leech
be
alone
,
and
be
of
course
unable
to
explain
his
position
,
even
if
he
have
be
incline
to
do
so
(
which
he
have
not
the
appearance
of
be
)
,
I
pass
him
and
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
turn
the
corner
of
Gray
's
Inn
-
square
,
I
be
beyond
expression
amazed
by
meet
another
leech
---
also
entirely
alone
,
and
also
proceed
in
a
westerly
direction
,
though
with
less
decision
of
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
ruminate
on
this
extraordinary
circumstance
,
and
endeavour
to
remember
whether
I
have
ever
read
,
in
the
Philosophical
Transactions
or
any
work
on
Natural
history
,
of
a
migration
of
leech
,
I
ascend
to
the
top
set
,
past
the
dreary
series
of
closed
outer
door
of
office
and
an
empty
set
or
two
,
which
intervene
between
that
lofty
region
and
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
enter
my
friend
's
room
,
I
find
him
stretch
upon
his
back
,
like
Prometheus
Bound
,
with
a
perfectly
demente
ticket
-
porter
in
attendance
on
him
instead
of
the
Vulture
:
 
which
helpless
individual
,
who
be
feeble
and
frightened
,
and
have
<EOS>
(
my
friend
explain
to
me
,
in
great
choler
)
be
endeavour
for
some
hour
to
apply
leech
to
his
leg
,
and
as
yet
have
only
get
on
two
out
of
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
Unfortunate
's
distraction
between
a
damp
cloth
on
which
he
have
place
the
leech
to
freshen
them
,
and
the
wrathful
adjuration
of
my
friend
to
"
stick
'em
on
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
refer
the
phenomenon
I
have
encounter
:
 
the
rather
as
two
fine
specimen
be
at
that
moment
go
out
at
the
door
,
while
a
general
insurrection
of
the
rest
be
in
progress
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
our
united
efforts
prevail
,
and
,
when
the
leech
come
off
and
have
recover
their
spirit
,
we
carefully
tie
them
up
in
a
decanter
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
hear
more
of
them
than
that
they
be
all
go
next
morning
,
and
that
the
Out
-
of
-
door
young
man
of
Bickle
,
Bush
and
Bodger
,
on
the
ground
floor
,
have
be
bite
and
blood
by
some
creature
not
identify
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
"
take
"
on
Mrs
Miggot
,
the
laundress
;
but
,
I
have
always
preserve
fresh
,
the
belief
that
she
unconsciously
carry
several
about
her
,
until
they
gradually
find
opening
in
life
.
   
<EOS>
second
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
same
staircase
with
my
friend
Parkle
,
and
on
the
same
floor
,
there
live
a
man
of
law
who
pursue
his
business
elsewhere
,
and
use
those
chamber
as
his
place
of
residence
.
 
<EOS>
for
three
or
four
year
,
Parkle
rather
know
of
him
than
know
him
,
but
after
that
---
for
Englishmen
---
short
pause
of
consideration
,
they
begin
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Parkle
exchange
word
with
him
in
his
private
character
only
,
and
know
nothing
of
his
business
way
,
or
mean
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
a
good
deal
about
town
,
but
always
alone
.
 
<EOS>
We
use
to
remark
to
one
another
,
that
although
we
often
encounter
him
in
theatre
,
concert
-
room
,
and
similar
public
place
,
he
be
always
alone
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
be
not
a
gloomy
man
,
and
be
of
a
decidedly
conversational
turn
;
insomuch
that
he
would
sometimes
of
an
evening
lounge
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
half
in
and
half
out
of
Parkle
's
room
,
and
discuss
the
topic
of
the
day
by
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
hint
on
these
occasion
that
he
have
four
fault
to
find
with
life
;
<EOS>
firstly
,
that
it
oblige
a
man
to
be
always
wind
up
his
watch
;
secondly
,
that
London
be
too
small
;
thirdly
,
that
it
therefore
want
variety
;
fourthly
,
that
there
be
too
much
dust
in
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
dust
in
his
own
fade
chamber
,
certainly
,
that
they
remind
me
of
a
sepulchre
,
furnish
in
prophetic
anticipation
of
the
present
time
,
which
have
newly
be
bring
to
light
,
after
have
remain
bury
a
few
thousand
year
.
 
<EOS>
one
dry
,
hot
autumn
evening
at
twilight
,
this
man
,
be
then
five
year
turn
of
fifty
,
look
in
upon
Parkle
in
his
usual
lounging
way
,
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
as
usual
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
go
out
of
town
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
never
go
out
of
town
,
Parkle
say
,
"
oh
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
for
what
be
a
man
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
London
be
so
small
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
go
West
,
you
come
to
Hounslow
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
go
East
,
you
come
to
Bow
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
go
South
,
there
be
Brixton
or
Norwood
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
go
North
,
you
can
not
get
rid
of
Barnet
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
monotony
of
all
the
street
,
street
,
street
---
and
of
all
the
road
,
road
,
road
---
and
the
dust
,
dust
,
dust
!
"
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
say
this
,
he
wish
Parkle
a
good
evening
,
but
come
back
again
and
say
,
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
"
oh
,
I
really
can
not
go
on
wind
up
this
watch
over
and
over
again
;
I
wish
you
would
take
care
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
Parkle
laugh
and
consent
,
and
the
man
go
out
of
town
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
remain
out
of
town
so
long
,
that
his
letter
-
box
become
choke
,
and
no
more
letter
could
be
get
into
it
,
and
they
begin
to
be
leave
at
the
lodge
and
to
accumulate
there
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
head
-
porter
decide
,
on
conference
with
the
steward
,
to
use
his
master
-
key
and
look
into
the
chamber
,
and
give
them
the
benefit
of
a
whiff
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
it
be
find
that
he
have
hang
himself
to
his
bedstead
,
and
have
leave
this
write
memorandum
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
prefer
to
be
cut
down
by
my
neighbour
and
friend
(
if
he
will
allow
me
to
call
him
so
)
,
H
Parkle
,
Esq
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
end
of
Parkle
's
occupancy
of
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
into
lodging
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
third
.
 
<EOS>
while
Parkle
live
in
Gray
's
Inn
,
and
I
myself
be
uncommercially
prepare
for
the
Bar
---
which
be
do
,
as
everybody
know
,
by
have
a
fray
old
gown
put
on
in
a
pantry
by
an
old
woman
in
a
chronic
state
of
Saint
Anthony
's
fire
and
dropsy
,
and
,
so
decorate
,
bolt
a
bad
dinner
in
a
party
of
four
,
whereof
each
individual
mistrust
the
other
three
---
I
say
,
while
these
thing
be
,
there
be
a
certain
elderly
gentleman
who
live
in
a
court
of
the
Temple
,
and
be
a
great
judge
and
lover
of
port
wine
.
 
<EOS>
every
day
he
dine
at
his
club
and
drink
his
bottle
or
two
of
port
wine
,
and
every
night
come
home
to
the
Temple
and
go
to
bed
in
his
lonely
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
go
on
many
year
without
variation
,
when
one
night
he
have
a
fit
on
come
home
,
and
fall
and
cut
his
head
deep
,
but
partly
recover
and
grope
about
in
the
dark
to
find
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
afterwards
discover
,
dead
,
it
be
clearly
establish
by
the
mark
of
his
hand
about
the
room
that
he
must
have
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
this
chance
on
the
night
of
Christmas
Eve
,
and
over
him
live
a
young
fellow
who
have
sister
and
young
country
friend
,
and
who
give
them
a
little
party
that
night
,
in
the
course
of
which
they
play
at
Blindman
's
Buff
.
 
<EOS>
They
play
that
game
,
for
their
great
sport
,
by
the
light
of
the
fire
only
;
and
once
,
when
they
be
all
quietly
rustle
and
steal
about
,
and
the
blindman
be
try
to
pick
out
the
pretty
sister
(
for
which
I
be
far
from
blame
him
)
,
somebody
cry
,
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
the
man
below
must
be
play
Blindman
's
Buff
by
himself
to
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
They
listen
,
and
they
hear
sound
of
some
one
fall
about
and
stumble
against
furniture
,
and
they
all
laugh
at
the
conceit
,
and
go
on
with
their
play
,
more
light
-
hearted
and
merry
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
those
two
so
different
game
of
life
and
death
be
play
out
together
,
blindfold
,
in
the
two
set
of
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
occurrence
,
which
,
come
to
my
knowledge
,
imbue
me
long
ago
with
a
strong
sense
of
the
loneliness
of
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fantastic
illustration
to
much
the
same
purpose
implicitly
believe
by
a
strange
sort
of
man
now
dead
,
whom
I
know
when
I
have
not
quite
arrive
at
legal
year
of
discretion
,
though
I
be
already
in
the
uncommercial
line
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
man
who
,
though
not
more
than
thirty
,
have
see
the
world
in
diver
irreconcilable
capacity
---
<EOS>
have
be
an
officer
in
a
south
american
regiment
among
other
odd
thing
---
but
have
not
achieve
much
in
any
way
of
life
,
and
be
in
debt
,
and
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
He
occupy
chamber
of
the
dreary
nature
in
Lyons
Inn
;
his
name
,
however
,
be
not
up

or

but
in
lieu
of
it
stand
the
name
of
a
friend
who
have
die
in
the
chamber
,
and
have
give
him
the
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
arise
out
of
the
furniture
,
and
be
to
this
effect
:
---
let
the
former
holder
of
the

when
he
have
but
very
scanty
furniture
for
his

and
none

<EOS>
He
have
live
some
wintry
month
in
this
condition

and
have

He

but
have

however

and
if
he
go
down
and

,
he
may
fairly
assume
the
coal
in
that
cellar
to
be

<EOS>
as

his
laundress
,
she
live
among
the

for

in
some
unknown

<EOS>
as

,
brood
over

or

or

.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Testator
take
his
coal
-
scuttle
in
one
hand
,
his
candle
and
key
in
the
other
,
and
descend
to
the
dismall
underground
den
of
Lyons
Inn
,
where
the
late
vehicle
in
the
street
become
thunderous
,
and
all
the
water

pipe
in
the
neighbourhood
seem
to
have
Macbeth
's
amen
stick
in
their
throat
,
and
to
be
try
to
get
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
after
grope
here
and
there
among
low
door
to
no
purpose
,
Mr
Testator
at
length
come
to
a
door
with
a
rusty
padlock
which
his
key
fit
.
 
<EOS>
get
the
door
open
with
much
trouble
,
and
look
in
,
he
find
,
no
coal
,
but
a
confused
pile
of
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
alarm
by
this
intrusion
on
another
man
's
property
,
he
lock
the
door
again
,
find
his
own
cellar
,
fill
his
scuttle
,
and
return
up
-
stair
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
furniture
he
have
see
,
run
on
castor
across
and
across
Mr
Testator
's
mind
incessantly
,
when
,
in
the
chill
hour
of
five
in
the
morning
,
he
get
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
particularly
want
a
table
to
write
at
,
and
a
table
expressly
make
to
be
write
at
,
have
be
the
piece
of
furniture
in
the
foreground
of
the
heap
.
 
<EOS>
when
his
laundress
emerge
from
her
burrow
in
the
morning
to
make
his
kettle
boil
,
he
artfully
lead
up
to
the
subject
of
cellar
and
furniture
;
but
the
two
idea
have
evidently
no
connexion
in
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
leave
him
,
and
he
sit
at
his
breakfast
,
think
about
the
furniture
,
he
recall
the
rusty
state
of
the
padlock
,
and
infer
that
the
furniture
must
have
be
store
in
the
cellar
for
a
long
time
---
be
perhaps
forget
---
owner
dead
,
perhaps
?
 
<EOS>
after
think
it
over
,
a
few
day
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
could
pump
nothing
out
of
Lyons
Inn
about
the
furniture
,
he
become
desperate
,
and
resolve
to
borrow
that
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
have
the
table
long
,
when
he
determine
to
borrow
an
easy
-
chair
;
he
have
not
have
that
long
,
when
he
make
up
his
mind
to
borrow
a
bookcase
;
then
,
a
couch
;
then
,
a
carpet
and
rug
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time
,
he
feel
he
be
"
in
furniture
step
in
so
far
,
"
as
that
it
could
be
no
bad
to
borrow
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
he
borrow
it
all
,
and
lock
up
the
cellar
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
lock
it
,
after
every
visit
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
carry
up
every
separate
article
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
,
at
the
good
,
have
feel
as
wicked
as
a
Resurrection
Man
.
 
<EOS>
every
article
be
blue
and
furry
when
bring
into
his
room
,
and
he
have
have
,
in
a
murderous
and
guilty
sort
of
way
,
to
polish
it
up
while
London
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Testator
live
in
his
furnished
chamber
two
or
three
year
,
or
more
,
and
gradually
lull
himself
into
the
opinion
that
the
furniture
be
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
convenient
state
of
mind
<EOS>
when
,
late
one
night
,
a
step
come
up
the
stair
,
and
a
hand
pass
over
his
door
feel
for
his
knocker
,
and
then
one
deep
and
solemn
rap
be
rap
that
may
have
be
a
spring
in
Mr
Testator
's
easy

chair
to
shoot
him
out
of
it

<EOS>
with
a
candle
in

Mr

go
to
the
door
,
and

with
very
high

,
a
very
narrow

He

in
a
long
thread

bare
black

up
the

with
more

and
under
his
arm
he
squeeze
an
umbrella
without

,
as

he
be

<EOS>
He
say
,
"
I

your
pardon
,
but
can

"
and
stop
;
his
eye
rest
on
some

<EOS>
"
Can

of
this
investigation

<EOS>
Mr

be
in
a
dreadful
state
,
for
(

possible
consequence
of
what
he
have
do
in
recklessness
and
hardihood
,
flash
upon
him
in
their
fulness
for
the

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
Mr

He

the

Staple

Barnard

<EOS>
the

the

Nurse

<EOS>
there
be
not
many
place
that
I
find
it
more
agreeable
to
revisit
when
I
be
in
an
idle
mood
,
than
some
place
to
which
I
have
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
my
acquaintance
with
those
spot
be
of
such
long
standing
,
and
have
ripen
into
an
intimacy
of
so
affectionate
a
nature
,
that
I
take
a
particular
interest
in
assure
myself
that
they
be
unchanged
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
be
in
Robinson
Crusoe
's
Island
,
yet
I
frequently
return
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
colony
he
establish
on
it
soon
fade
away
,
and
it
be
uninhabite
by
any
descendant
of
the
grave
and
courteous
Spaniards
,
or
of
Will
Atkins
and
the
other
mutineer
,
and
have
relapse
into
its
original
condition
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
twig
of
its
wicker
house
remain
,
its
goat
have
long
run
wild
again
,
its
scream
parrot
would
darken
the
sun
with
a
cloud
of
many
flaming
colour
if
a

be
fire
there
,
no

in
the
water
of
the
little
creek
which
Friday
swam
across
when
pursue
by
his
two
brother
cannibal
with
sharpen
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
after
compare
note
with
other
traveller
who
have
similarly
revisit
the
Island
and
conscientiously
inspect
it
,
I
have
satisfy
myself
that
it
contain
no
vestige
of
Mr
Atkins
's
domesticity
or
theology
,
though
his
track
on
the
memorable
evening
of
his
landing
to
set
his
captain
ashore
,
when
he
be
decoy
about
and
round
about
until
it
be
dark
,
and
his
boat
be
stave
,
and
his
strength
and
spirit
fail
him
,
be
yet
plainly
to
be
trace
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
the
hill
-
top
on
which
Robinson
be
strike
dumb
with
joy
when
the
reinstate
captain
point
to
the
ship

<EOS>
ride
within
half
a

of
the
shore
,
that
be
to
bear
him
away
,
in
the
nine
-
and
-
twentieth
year
of
his
seclusion
in
that
lonely
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
the
sandy
beach
on
which
the
memorable
footstep
be
impress
,
and
where
the
savage
haul
up
their
canoe
when
they
come
ashore
for
those
dreadful
public
dinner
,
which
lead
to
a
dancing
bad
than
speech

making
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
the
cave
where
the
flare
eye
of
the
old
goat
make
such
a
goblin
appearance
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
the
site
of
the
hut
where
Robinson
live
with
the
dog
and
the
parrot
and
the
cat
,
and
where
he
endure
those
first
agony
of
solitude
,
which
---
strange
to
say
---
never
involve
any
ghostly
fancy
;
a
circumstance
so
very
remarkable
,
that
perhaps
he
leave
out
something
in
write
his
record
?
 
<EOS>
round
hundred
of
such
object
,
hide
in
the
dense
tropical
foliage
,
the
tropical
sea
break
evermore
;
and
over
them
the
tropical
sky
,
save
in
the
short
rainy
season
,
shine
bright
and
cloudless
.
   
<EOS>
neither
,
be
I
ever
belate
among
wolf
,
on
the
border
of
France
and
Spain
;
nor
,
do
I
ever
,
when
night
be
close
in
and
the
ground
be
cover
with
snow
,
draw
up
my
little
company
among
some
fell
tree
which
serve
as
a
breastwork
,
and
there
fire
a
train
of
gunpowder
so
dexterously
that
suddenly
we
have
three
or
four
score
blaze
wolf
illuminate
the
darkness
around
us
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
occasionally
go
back
to
that
dismal
region
and
perform
the
feat
again
;
when
indeed
to
smell
the
singeing
and
the
frying
of
the
wolf
afire
,
and
to
see
them
set
one
another
alight
as
they
rush
and
tumble
,
and
to
behold
them
roll
in
the
snow
vainly
attempt
to
put
themselves
out
,
and
to
hear
their
howling
take
up
by
all
the
echo
as
well
as
by
all
the
unseen
wolf
within
the
wood
,
make
me
tremble
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
never
in
the
robber
'
cave
,
where
Gil
Blas
live
,
but
I
often
go
back
there
and
find
the
trap
-
door
just
as
heavy
to
raise
as
it
use
to
be
,
while
that
wicked
old
disabled
Black
lie
everlastingly
curse
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
in
Don
Quixote
's
study
,
where
he
read
his
book
of
chivalry
until
he
rise
and
hack
at
imaginary
giant
,
and
then
refresh
himself
with
great
draught
of
water
,
yet
you
could
not
move
a
book
in
it
without
my
knowledge
,
or
with
my
consent
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
(
thank
Heaven
)
in
company
with
the
little
old
woman
who
hobble
out
of
the
chest
and
tell
the
merchant
Abudah
to
go
in
search
of
the
Talisman
of
Oromanes
,
yet
<EOS>
I
make
it
my
business
to
know
that
she
be
well
preserve
and
as
intolerable
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
at
the
school
where
the
boy
Horatio
Nelson
get
out
of
bed
to
steal
the
pear
:
 
not
because
he
want
any
,
but
because
every
other
boy
be
afraid
:
 
yet
<EOS>
I
have
several
time
be
back
to
this
Academy
,
to
see
him
let
down
out
of
window
with
a
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
so
with
Damascus
,
and
Bagdad
,
and
Brobingnag
(
which
have
the
curious
fate
of
be
usually
misspell
when
write

,
and
Lilliput
,
and
Laputa
,
and
the
Nile
,
and
Abyssinia
,
and
the
Ganges
,
and
the
North
Pole
,
and
many
hundred
of
place
---
I
be
never
at
them
,
yet
it
be
an
affair
of
my
life
to
keep
them
intact
,
and
I
be
always
go
back
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
be
in
Dullborough
one
day
,
revisit
the
association
of
my
childhood
as
record
in
previous
page
of
these
note
,
my
experience
in
this
wise
be
make
quite
inconsiderable
and
of
no
account
,
by
the
quantity
of
place
and
people
---
utterly
impossible
place
and
people
,
but
none
the
less
alarmingly
real
<EOS>
---
that
I
find
I
have
be
introduce
to
by
my
nurse
before
I
be
six
year
old
,
and
use
to
be
force
to
go
back
to
at
night
without
at
all
want
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
all
know
our
own
mind
(
in
a
more
enlarged
sense
than
the
popular
acceptation
of
that
phrase
)
,
I
suspect
we
should
find
our
nurse
responsible
for
most
of
the
dark
corner
we
be
force
to
go
back
to
,
against
our
will
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
diabolical
character
who
intrude
himself
on
my
peaceful
youth
(
as
I
call
to
mind
that
day
at
Dullborough
)
,
be
a
certain
Captain
Murderer
.
 
<EOS>
this
wretch
must
have
be
an
off
-
shoot
of
the
Blue
Beard
family
,
but
I
have
no
suspicion
of
the
consanguinity
in
those
time
.
 
<EOS>
His
warning
name
would
seem
to
have
awaken
no
general
prejudice
against
him
,
for
he
be
admit
into
the
good
society
and
possess
immense
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Murderer
's
mission
be
matrimony
,
and
the
gratification
of
a
cannibal
appetite
with
tender
bride
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
marriage
morning
,
he
always
cause
both
side
of
the
way
to
church
to
be
plant
with
curious
flower
;
and
when
his
bride
say
,
"
dear
Captain
Murderer
,
I
ever
see
flower
like
these
before
:
 
what
be
they
call
?
"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
"
They
be
call
Garnish
for
house
-
lamb
,
"
and
laugh
at
his
ferocious
practical
joke
in
a
horrid
manner
,
disquiet
the
mind
of
the
noble
bridal
company
,
with
a
very
sharp
show
of
tooth
,
then
display
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
love
in
a
coach
and
six
,
and
marry
in
a
coach
and
twelve
,
and
all
his
horse
be
milk
-
white
horse
with
one
red
spot
on
the
back
which
he
cause
to
be
hide
by
the
harness
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
the
spot
WOULD
come
there
,
though
every
horse
be
milk
-
white
when
Captain
Murderer
buy
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
spot
be
young
bride
's
blood
.
 
<EOS>
(
to
this
terrific
point
I
be
indebted
for
my
first
personal
experience
of
a
shudder
and
cold
bead
on
the
forehead
.
)
 
<EOS>
when
Captain
Murderer
have
make
an
end
of
feasting
and
revelry
,
and
have
dismiss
the
noble
guest
,
and
be
alone
with
his
wife
on
the
day
month
after
their
marriage
,
it
be
his
whimsical
custom
to
produce
a
golden
rolling
-
pin
and
a
silver
pie
-
board
.
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
this
special
feature
in
the
Captain
's
courtship
,
that
he
always
ask
if
the
young
lady
could
make
pie
-
crust
;
and
if
she
could
not
by
nature
or
education
,
she
be
teach
.
 
<EOS>
well
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
bride
see
Captain
Murderer
produce
the
golden
rolling
-
pin
and
silver
pie
-
board
,
she
remember
this
,
and
turn
up
her
laced
-
silk
sleeve
to
make
a
pie
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
bring
out
a
silver
pie
-
dish
of
immense
capacity
,
and
the
Captain
bring
out
flour
and
butter
and
egg
and
all
thing
needful
,
except
the
inside
of
the
pie
;
of
material
for
the
staple
of
the
pie
itself
,
the
Captain
bring
out
none
.
 
<EOS>
then
say
the
lovely
bride
,
"
dear
Captain
Murderer
<EOS>
,
what
pie
be
this
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
"
a
meat
pie
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
say
the
lovely
bride
,
"
dear
Captain
Murderer
<EOS>
,
I
see
no
meat
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
humorously
retort
,
"
look
in
the
glass
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
look
in
the
glass
,
but
still
she
see
no
meat
,
and
then
the
Captain
roar
with
laughter
,
and
suddenly
frown
and
draw
his
sword
,
bade
her
roll
out
the
crust
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
roll
out
the
crust
,
drop
large
tear
upon
it
all
the
time
because
he
be
so
cross
,
and
when
she
have
line
the
dish
with
crust
and
have
cut
the
crust
all
ready
to
fit
the
top
,
the
Captain
call
out
,
"
I
see
the
meat
in
the
glass
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
bride
look
up
at
the
glass
,
just
in
time
to
see
the
Captain
cut
her
head
off
;
and
he
chop
her
in
piece
,
and
pepper
her
,
and
salt
her
,
and
put
her
in
the
pie
,
and
send
it
to
the
baker
's
,
and
eat
it
all
,
and
pick
the
bone
.
   
<EOS>
Captain
Murderer
go
on
in
this
way
,
prosper
exceedingly
,
until
he
come
to
choose
a
bride
from
two
twin
sister
,
and
at
first
do
not
know
which
to
choose
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
though
one
be
fair
and
the
other
dark
,
they
be
both
equally
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fair
twin
love
him
,
and
the
dark
twin
hate
him
,
so
he
choose
the
fair
one
.
<EOS>
the
dark
twin
would
have
prevent
the
marriage
if
she
could
,
but
she
could
not
;
however
,
on
the
night
before
it
,
much
suspect
Captain
Murderer
,
she
steal
out
and
climb
his
garden
wall
,
and
look
in
at
his
window
through
a
chink
in
the
shutter
,
and
see
him
have
his
tooth
file
sharp
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
she
listen
all
day
,
and
hear
him
make
his
joke
about
the
house
-
lamb
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
day
month
,
he
have
the
paste
roll
out
,
and
cut
the
fair
twin
's
head
off
,
and
chop
her
in
piece
,
and
pepper
her
,
and
salt
her
,
and
put
her
in
the
pie
,
and
send
it
to
the
baker
's
,
and
eat
it
all
,
and
pick
the
bone
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
dark
twin
have
have
her
suspicion
much
increase
by
the
filing
of
the
Captain
's
tooth
,
and
again
by
the
house
-
lamb
joke
.
<EOS>
put
all
thing
together
when
he
give
out
that
her
sister
be
dead
,
she
divine
the
truth
,
and
determine
to
be
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
she
go
up
to
Captain
Murderer
's
house
,
and
knock
at
the
knocker
and
pull
at
the
bell
,
and
when
the
Captain
come
to
the
door
,
say
:
 
"
dear
Captain
Murderer
,
marry
me
next
,
for
I
always
love
you
and
be
jealous
of
my
sister
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
take
it
as
a
compliment
,
and
make
a
polite
answer
,
and
the
marriage
be
quickly
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
night
before
it
,
the
bride
again
climb
to
his
window
,
and
again
see
him
have
his
tooth
file
sharp
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
sight
she
laugh
such
a
terrible
laugh
at
the
chink
in
the
shutter
,
that
the
Captain
's
blood
curdle
,
and
he
say
:
 
"
I
hope
nothing
have
disagree
with
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
that
,
she
laugh
again
,
a
still
more
terrible
laugh
,
and
the
shutter
be
open
and
search
make
,
but
she
be
nimbly
go
,
and
there
be
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
they
go
to
church
in
a
coach
and
twelve
,
and
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
day
month
,
she
roll
the
pie
-
crust
out
,
and
Captain
Murderer
cut
her
head
off
,
and
chop
her
in
piece
,
and
pepper
her
,
and
salt
her
,
and
put
her
in
the
pie
,
and
send
it
to
the
baker
's
,
and
eat
it
all
,
and
pick
the
bone
.
   
<EOS>
but
before
she
begin
to
roll
out
the
paste
she
have
take
a
deadly
poison
of
a
most
awful
character
,
distil
from
toad
'
eye
and
spider
'
knee
;
and
Captain
Murderer
have
hardly
pick
her
last
bone
,
when
he
begin
to
swell
,
and
to
turn
blue
,
and
to
be
all
over
spot
,
and
to
scream
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
go
on
swell
and
turn
bluer
,
and
be
more
all
over
spot
and
scream
,
until
he
reach
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
from
wall
to
wall
;
and
then
,
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
blow
up
with
a
loud
explosion
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
sound
of
it
,
all
the
milk
-
white
horse
in
the
stable
break
their
halter
and
go
mad
,
and
then
they
gallop
over
everybody
in
Captain
Murderer
's
house
(
<EOS>
begin
with
the
family
blacksmith
who
have
file
his
tooth
)
until
the
whole
be
dead
,
and
then
they
gallop
away
.
   
<EOS>
hundred
of
time
<EOS>
do
I
hear
this
legend
of
Captain
Murderer
,
in
my
early
youth
,
and
add
hundred
of
time
be
there
a
mental
compulsion
upon
me
in
bed
,
to
peep
in
at
his
window
as
the
dark
twin
peep
,
and
to
revisit
his
horrible
house
,
and
look
at
him
in
his
blue
and
spotty
and
scream
stage
,
as
he
reach
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
from
wall
to
wall
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
woman
who
bring
me
acquaint
with
Captain
Murderer
have
a
fiendish
enjoyment
of
my
terror
,
and
use
to
begin
,
I
remember
---
as
a
sort
of
introductory
overture
---
by
claw
the
air
with
both
hand
,
and
utter
a
long
low
hollow
groan
.
 
<EOS>
so
acutely
do
I
suffer
from
this
ceremony
in
combination
with
this
infernal
Captain
,
that
I
sometimes
use
to
plead
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
hardly
strong
enough
and
old
enough
to
hear
the
story
again
just
yet
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
she
never
spare
me
one
word
of
it
,
and
indeed
command
the
awful
chalice
to
my
lip
as
the
only
preservative
know
to
science
against
"
the
Black
Cat
"
---
a
weird
and
glaring
-
eyed
supernatural
Tom
,
who
be
repute
to
prowl
about
the
world
by
night
,
suck
the
breath
of
infancy
,
and
who
be
endow
with
a
special
thirst
(
as
I
be
give
to
understand
)
for
mine
.
   
<EOS>
this
female
bard
---
may
she
have
be
repay
my
debt
of
obligation
to
her
in
the
matter
of
nightmare
and
perspiration
!
<EOS>
---
reappear
in
my
memory
as
the
daughter
of
a
shipwright
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
be
mercy
,
though
she
have
none
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
a
shipbuilding
flavour
in
the
follow
story
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
always
recur
to
me
in
a
vague
association
with
calomel
pill
,
I
believe
it
to
have
be
reserve
for
dull
night
when
I
be
low
with
medicine
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
once
a
shipwright
,
and
he
work
in
a
Government
Yard
,
and
his
name
be
chip
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
father
's
name
before
him
be
Chips
,
and
his
father
's
name
before
him
be
chip
,
and
they
be
all
chips
.
 
<EOS>
and
Chips
the
father
have
sell
himself
to
the
Devil
for
an
iron
pot
and
a
bushel
of
tenpenny
nail
and
half
a
ton
of
copper
and
a
rat
that
could
speak
;
and
chip
the
grandfather
have
sell
himself
to
the
Devil
for
an
iron
pot
and
a
bushel
of
tenpenny
nail
and
half
a
ton
of
copper
and
a
rat
that
could
speak
;
and
chip
<EOS>
the
great
-
grandfather
have
dispose
of
himself
in
the
same
direction
on
the
same
term
;
and
the
bargain
have
run
in
the
family
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
one
day
,
when
young
chip
be
at
work
in
the
Dock
Slip
all
alone
,
down
in
the
dark
hold
of
an
old
seventy
-
four
that
be
hale
up
for
repair
,
the
Devil
present
himself
,
and
remark
:
   
"
<EOS>
A
Lemon
have
pip
,
and
a
Yard
have
ship
,
and
I
will
have
chip
!
"
   
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
know
why
,
but
this
fact
of
the
Devil
's
express
himself
in
rhyme
be
peculiarly
try
to
me
.
)
 
<EOS>
chip
look
up
when
he
hear
the
word
,
and
there
he
see
the
Devil
with
saucer
eye
that
squint
on
a
terrible
great
scale
,
and
that
strike
out
spark
of
blue
fire
continually
.
 
<EOS>
and
whenever
he
wink
his
eye
,
shower
of
blue
spark
come
out
,
and
his
eyelash
make
a
clattering
like
flint
and
steel
strike
light
.
 
<EOS>
and
hang
over
one
of
his
arm
by
the
handle
be
an
iron
pot
,
and
under
that
arm
be
a
bushel
of
tenpenny
nail
,
and
under
his
other
arm
be
half
a
ton
of
copper
,
and
sit
on
one
of
his
shoulder
be
a
rat
that
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
Devil
say
again
:
   
"
<EOS>
A
Lemon
have
pip
,
and
a
Yard
have
ship
,
and
I
will
have
chip
!
"
   
<EOS>
(
the
invariable
effect
of
this
alarm
tautology
on
the
part
of
the
Evil
Spirit
be
to
deprive
me
of
my
sense
for
some
moment
.
)
<EOS>
so
,
chip
answer
never
a
word
,
but
go
on
with
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
do
,
chip
?
"
say
the
rat
that
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
put
in
new
plank
where
you
and
your
gang
have
eat
old
away
,
"
say
chip
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
we
will
eat
them
too
,
"
say
the
rat
that
could
speak
;
"
and
we
will
let
in
the
water
and
drown
the
crew
,
and
we
will
eat
them
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
chip
,
be
only
a
shipwright
,
and
not
a
man
-
of
-
war
's
man
,
say
,
"
You
be
welcome
to
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
keep
his
eye
off
the
half
a
ton
of
copper
or
the
bushel
of
tenpenny
nail
;
for
nail
and
copper
be
a
shipwright
's
sweetheart
,
and
shipwright
will
run
away
with
them
whenever
they
can
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
Devil
say
,
"
I
see
what
you
be
look
at
,
chip
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
well
strike
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
term
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
before
you
be
well
acquaint
with
them
,
and
<EOS>
so
be
your
grandfather
and
great
-
grandfather
before
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
say
Chips
,
"
I
like
the
copper
,
and
I
like
the
nail
,
and
I
do
not
mind
the
pot
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
like
the
rat
.
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
Devil
,
fiercely
,
"
You
can
not
have
the
metal
without
him
---
and
he
be
a
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
chip
,
afraid
of
lose
the
half
a
ton
of
copper
and
the
bushel
of
nail
,
then
say
,
"
give
us
hold
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
get
the
copper
and
the
nail
and
the
pot
and
the
rat
that
could
speak
,
and
the
Devil
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
chip
sell
the
copper
,
and
he
sell
the
nail
,
and
he
would
have
sell
the
pot
;
but
whenever
he
offer
it
for
sale
,
the
rat
be
in
it
,
and
the
dealer
drop
it
,
and
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
chip
resolve
to
kill
the
rat
,
and
,
be
at
work
in
the
Yard
one
day
with
a
great
kettle
of
hot
pitch
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
iron
pot
with
the
rat
in
it
on
the
other
,
he
turn
the
scald
pitch
into
the
pot
,
and
fill
it
full
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
keep
his
eye
upon
it
till
it
cool
and
harden
,
and
then
he
let
it
stand
for
twenty
day
,
and
then
he
heat
the
pitch
again
and
turn
it
back
into
the
kettle
,
and
then
he
sink
the
pot
in
water
for
twenty
day
more
,
and
then
he
get
the
smelter
to
put
it
in
the
furnace
for
twenty
day
more
,
and
then
they
give
it
him
out
,
red
hot
,
and
look
like
red
-
hot
glass
instead
of
iron
-
<EOS>
yet
there
be
the
rat
in
it
,
just
the
same
as
ever
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
moment
it
catch
his
eye
<EOS>
,
it
say
with
a
jeer
:
   
<EOS>
"
A
Lemon
have
pip
,
and
a
Yard
have
ship
,
and
I
will
have
chip
!
"
   
<EOS>
(
for
this
Refrain
I
have
wait
since
its
last
appearance
,
with
inexpressible
horror
,
which
now
culminate
.
)
 
<EOS>
chip
now
feel
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
the
rat
would
stick
to
him
;
the
rat
,
answer
his
thought
,
say
,
"
I
will
---
like
pitch
!
"
   
<EOS>
now
,
as
the
rat
leap
out
of
the
pot
when
it
have
speak
,
and
make
off
,
chip
begin
to
hope
that
it
would
not
keep
its
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
a
terrible
thing
happen
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
when
dinner
-
time
come
,
and
the
Dock
-
bell
rang
to
strike
work
,
he
put
his
rule
into
the
long
pocket
at
the
side
of
his
trouser
,
and
there
he
find
a
rat
---
not
that
rat
,
but
another
rat
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
his
hat
,
he
find
another
;
and
in
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
another
;
and
in
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
when
he
pull
it
on
to
go
to
dinner
,
two
more
.
 
<EOS>
and
from
that
time
he
find
himself
so
frightfully
intimate
with
all
the
rat
in
the
Yard
,
that
they
climb
up
his
leg
when
he
be
at
work
,
and
sit
on
his
tool
while
he
use
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
could
all
speak
to
one
another
,
and
he
understand
what
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
get
into
his
lodging
,
and
into
his
bed
,
and
into
his
teapot
,
and
into
his
beer
,
and
into
his
boot
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
go
to
be
marry
to
a
corn
-
chandler
's
daughter
;
and
when
he
give
her
a
workbox
<EOS>
he
have
himself
make
for
her
,
a
rat
jump
out
of
it
;
and
when
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
<EOS>
a
rat
clung
about
her
;
so
the
marriage
be
break
off
,
though
the
bann
be
already
twice
put
up
---
which
the
parish
clerk
well
remember
,
for
,
as
he
hand
the
book
to
the
clergyman
for
the
second
time
of
asking
,
a
large
fat
rat
run
over
the
leaf
.
 
<EOS>
(
by
this
time
a
special
cascade
of
rat
be
roll
down
my
back
,
and
the
whole
of
my
small
listening
person
be
overrun
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
interval
ever
since
,
I
have
be
morbidly
afraid
of
my
own
pocket
,
lest
my
explore
hand
should
find
a
speciman
or
two
of
those
vermin
in
it
.
)
   
<EOS>
You
may
believe
that
all
this
be
very
terrible
to
chip
;
but
even
all
this
be
not
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
besides
,
what
the
rat
be
do
,
wherever
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
sometimes
he
would
cry
aloud
,
when
he
be
at
his
club
at
night
,
"
oh
!
 
<EOS>
keep
the
rat
out
of
the
convict
'
burying
-
ground
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
let
them
do
that
!
"
 
<EOS>
or
,
"
there
be
one
of
them
at
the
cheese
down
-
stair
!
"
 
<EOS>
or
,
"
there
be
two
of
them
smell
at
the
baby
in
the
garret
!
"
 
<EOS>
or
,
other
thing
of
that
sort
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
be
vote
mad
,
and
lose
his
work
in
the
yard
,
and
could
get
no
other
work
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
King
George
want
man
,
so
before
very
long
he
get
press
for
a
sailor
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
be
take
off
in
a
boat
one
evening
to
his
ship
,
lie
at
Spithead
,
ready
to
sail
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
first
thing
he
make
out
in
her
as
he
get
near
her
,
be
the
figure
-
head
of
the
old
Seventy
-
four
,
where
he
have
see
the
Devil
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
call
the
Argonaut
,
and
they
row
right
under
the
bowsprit
where
the
figure
-
head
of
the
Argonaut
,
with
a
sheepskin
in
his
hand
and
a
blue
gown
on
,
be
look
out
to
sea
;
and
sit
stare
on
his
forehead
be
the
rat
who
could
speak
,
and
his
exact
word
be
these
:
 
"
chip
ahoy
!
 
<EOS>
old
boy
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
pretty
well
eat
them
too
,
and
we
will
drown
the
crew
,
and
will
eat
them
too
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
here
I
always
become
exceedingly
faint
,
and
would
have
ask
for
water
,
but
that
I
be
speechless
.
)
   
<EOS>
the
ship
be
bind
for
the
Indies
;
and
if
you
do
not
know
where
that
is
,
you
ought
to
it
,
and
angel
will
never
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
(
here
I
feel
myself
an
outcast
from
a
future
state
.
)
 
<EOS>
the
ship
set
sail
that
very
night
,
and
she
sail
,
and
sail
,
and
sail
.
 
<EOS>
Chips
's
feeling
be
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
ever
equal
his
terror
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
day
he
ask
leave
to
speak
to
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>

in

me
back

a

I

by

have
avoid

this

my

<EOS>
there
be
a
narrative
concern
an
unearthly
animal
forebode
death
,
which
appear
in
the
open
street
to
a
parlour
-
maid
who
"
go
to
fetch
the
beer
"
for
supper
:
 
first
(
as
I
now
recall
it
)
assume
the
likeness
of
a
black
dog
,
and
gradually
rise
on
its
hind
-
leg
and
swell
into
the
semblance
of
some
quadrupe
greatly
surpass
a
hippopotamus
:
 
which
apparition
---
not
because
I
deem
it
in
the
least
improbable
,
but
because
I
feel
it
to
be
really
too
large
to
bear
---
I
feebly
endeavour
to
explain
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
Mercy

retorting
with
wounded
dignity
that
the
parlour
-
maid
be
her
own
sister

in

law
,
I
perceive
there
be
no
hope
,
and
resign
myself
to
this
zoological
phenomenon
as
one
of
my
many
pursuer
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
narrative
describe
the
apparition
of
a
young
woman
who
come
out
of
a
glass

case
and
haunt
another
young

until
the

<EOS>
this
narrative
<EOS>
I
consider
---
I
have
a
personal
interest
in
disproving

because
we
have
glass

at

and
how

otherwise

up

but
my
remorseless
nurse
cut
the
ground
from
under
my
tender
foot

by
inform
me
that
She

I

such
be
a

against

really

as

it

not

I

<EOS>
be
in
a
humour
for
complete
solitude
and
uninterrupted
meditation
this
autumn
,
I
have
take
a
lodging
for
six
week
in
the
most
unfrequented
part
of
England
---
in
a

,
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
the
retreat
into
which
I

<EOS>
from
this
lonely

I
make
pilgrimage
into
the
surround

traverse
extensive

of
the
Great
Desert
.
 
<EOS>
the

solemn
feeling

profound

I
enjoy
that

feel
revive
within
me
that
latent
wildness
of
the
original
savage

which
have
be
(
upon

somewhat
frequently

notice
by
traveller

sea

awake
,
shoot

,
and
a
choice
of
rough
waterproof
head

gear
for
the

and
mountain
,
he
have
put
upon
the
head
of
his

as
much
of
this

as
they
could
carry

have
take

off

<EOS>
the
young

have
let
out
the
fire
at
which
the
iron
be
heat
,
and
,
save
his
strong
sense
of
duty
,
I
see
no
reason
why
he
should
take
the
shutter
down
.
   
<EOS>
happily
for
himself
and
for
his
country
the
young
man
be
a
Volunteer
;
most
happily
for
himself
,
or
I
think
he
would
become
the
prey
of
a
settle
melancholy

<EOS>
for
,
to
live
surround
by
human
hat
,
and
alienate
from
human
head
to
fit
them
on
,
be
surely
a
great
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
young
man
,
sustain
by
practise
his
exercise
,
and
by
constantly
furbish
up
his
regulation
plume
(
it
be
unnecessary
to
observe
that
,
as
a
hatter
,
he
be
in
a
cock'

)
,
be
resign
,
and
uncomplaining
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Saturday
,
when
he
close
early
and
get
his
Knickerbockers
on
,
he
be
even
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
gratefully
particular
in
this
reference
to
him
,
because
he
be
my
companion
through
many
peaceful
hour
.
   
<EOS>
My
hatter
have
a
desk
up
certain
step
behind
his
counter

enclose
like
the
clerk

desk
at

<EOS>
I
shut
myself
into
this
place
of
seclusion
,
after
breakfast
,
and
meditate
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
I
observe
the
young
man
load
an
imaginary
rifle
with
the
great
precision
,
and
maintain
a
most
galling
and
destructive
fire
upon
the
national
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
publicly
for
his
companionship
and
his
patriotism
.
   
<EOS>
the
simple
character
of
my
life
,
and
the
calm
nature
of
the
scene
by
which
I
be
surround
,
occasion
me
to
rise
early
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
forth
in
my
slipper
,
and
promenade
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pastoral
to
feel
the
freshness
of
the
air
in
the
uninhabited
town
,
and
to
appreciate
the
shepherdess
character
of
the
few
milkwoman
who
purvey
so
little
milk
that
it
would
be
worth
nobody
be
while
to
adulterate
it
,
if
anybody
be
leave
to
undertake
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
crowded
sea
-
shore
,
the
great
demand
for
milk
,
combine
with
the
strong
local
temptation
of
chalk
,
would
betray
itself
in
the
lower
quality
of
the
article
.
 
<EOS>
in
arcadian
London
I
derive
it
from
the
cow
.
   
<EOS>
the
arcadian
simplicity
of
the
metropolis
altogether
,
and
the
primitive
way
into
which
it
have
fall
in
this
autumnal
Golden
Age
,
make
it
entirely
new
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
within
a
few
hundred
yard
of
my
retreat
,
be
the
house
of
a
friend
who
maintain
a
most
sumptuous
butler
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
,
until
yesterday
,
see
that
butler
out
of
superfine
black
broadcloth
.
 
<EOS>
until
yesterday
,
I
never
see
him
off
duty
<EOS>
,
never
see
him
(
he
be
the
good
of
butler
)
with
the
appearance
of
have
any
mind
for
anything
<EOS>
but
the
glory
of
his
master
and
his
master
's
friend
.
 
<EOS>
yesterday
morning
,
walk
in
my
slipper
near
the
house
of
which
he
be
the
prop
and
ornament
---
a
house
now
a
waste
of
shutter
---
I
encounter
that
butler
,
also
in
his
slipper
,
and
in
a
shooting
suit
of
one
colour
,
and
in
a
low
-
crown
straw
-
hat
,
smoke
an
early
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
we
have
formerly
meet
in
another
state
of
existence
,
and
that
we
be
translate
into
a
new
sphere
.
 
<EOS>
wisely
and
<EOS>
well
,
he
pass
me
without
recognition
.
 
<EOS>
under
his
arm
he
carry
the
morning
paper
,
and
shortly
afterwards
I
see
him
sit
on
a
rail
in
the
pleasant
open
landscape
of
regent
-
street
,
peruse
it
at
his
ease
under
the
ripen
sun
.
   
<EOS>
My
landlord
have
take
his
whole
establishment
to
be
salt
down
,
I
be
wait
on
by
an
elderly
woman
labour
under
a
chronic
sniff
,
who
,
at
the
shadowy
hour
of
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
of
every
evening
,
give
admittance
at
the
street
door
to
a
meagre
and
mouldy
old
man
whom
I
have
never
yet
see
detach
from
a
flat
pint
of
beer
in
a
pewter
pot
.
 
<EOS>
the
meagre
and
mouldy
old
man
be
her
husband
,
and
the
pair
have
a
dejected
consciousness
that
they
be
not
justified
in
appear
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
out
of
some
hole
when
London
empty
itself
,
and
go
in
again
when
it
fill
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
arrive
on
the
evening
when
I
myself
take
possession
,
and
they
arrive
with
the
flat
pint
of
beer
,
and
their
bed
in
a
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
a
weak
old
man
,
and
appear
to
me
to
get
the
bed
down
the
kitchen
stair
by
tumble
down
with
and
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
their
bed
in
the
low
and
remotest
corner
of
the
basement
,
and
they
smell
of
bed
,
and
have
no
possession
but
bed
:
 
unless
it
be
(
which
I
rather
infer
from
an
under
-
current
of
flavour
in
them
)
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
their
name
,
through
the
chance
of
have
call
the
wife
's
attention
,
at
half
-
past
nine
on
the
second
evening
of
our
acquaintance
,
to
the
circumstance
of
there
be
some
one
at
the
house
door
;
when
she
apologetically
explain
,
"
It
be
only
Mr
Klem
.
"
 
<EOS>
what
become
of
Mr
Klem
all
day
,
or
when
he
go
out
,
or
why
,
be
a
mystery
I
can
not
penetrate
;
but
at
half
-
past
nine
he
never
fail
to
turn
up
on
the
door
-
step
with
the
flat
pint
of
beer
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
pint
of
beer
,
flat
as
it
be
,
be
so
much
more
important
than
himself
,
that
it
always
seem
to
my
fancy
as
if
it
have
find
him
drivel
in
the
street
and
have
humanely
bring
him
home
.
 
<EOS>
in
make
his
way
below
,
Mr
Klem
never
go
down
the
middle
of
the
passage
,
like
another
Christian
,
but
shuffle
against
the
wall
as
if
entreat
me
to
take
notice
that
he
be
occupy
as
little
space
as
possible
in
the
house
;
and
whenever
I
come
upon
him
face
to
face
<EOS>
,
he
back
from
me
in
fascinated
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
extraordinary
circumstance
I
have
trace
in
connexion
with
this
aged
couple
,
be
,
that
there
be
a
Miss
Klem
,
their
daughter
,
apparently
ten
year
old
than
either
of
them
,
who
have
also
a
bed
and
smell
of
it
,
and
carry
it
about
the
earth
at
dusk
and
hide
it
in
deserted
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
into
this
piece
of
knowledge
through
Mrs
Klem
be
beseech
me
to
sanction
the
sheltering
of
Miss
Klem
under
that
roof
for
a
single
night
,
"
between
her
takin
"
care
of
the
upper
part
in
Pall
Mall
which
the
family
of
his
back
,
and
a
'
ouse
in
Serjameses
-
street
,
which
the
family
of
leave
towng
ter
-
morrer
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
my
gracious
consent
(
have
nothing
that
I
know
of
to
do
with
it
)
,
and
in
the
shadowy
hour
Miss
Klem
become
perceptible
on
the
door
-
step
,
wrestle
with
a
bed
in
a
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
where
she
make
it
up
for
the
night
I
can
not
positively
state
,
but
,
I
think
,
in
a
sink
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
with
the
instinct
of
a
reptile
or
an
insect
,
she
stow
it
and
herself
away
in
deep
obscurity
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Klem
family
,
I
have
notice
another
remarkable
gift
of
nature
,
and
that
be
a
power
they
possess
of
convert
everything
into
flue
.
 
<EOS>
such
broken
victual
as
they
take
by
stealth
,
appear
(
whatever
the
nature
of
the
viand

emerge

in

among

soothe

I

thus

I

<EOS>

I

<EOS>
then
,
do
it
appear
to
me
that
in
this
age
three
thing
be
clamorously
require
of
man
in

miscellaneous
thoroughfare
of
the

<EOS>
firstly

that

<EOS>
secondly

that
he
eat
a

<EOS>
thirdly

that
he
get
himself
photograph

<EOS>
then
do
I
speculate

what
have
those
seam

artist
be
who
stand
at
the
photograph
door
in
greek
cap

sample

mysteriously
salute
the
public
---
the
female
public
with
a
pressing
tenderness
---
to
come
in

be
"
take

?
 
<EOS>
what
do
they
do
with
their
greasy
blandishment
,
before
the
era
of
cheap
photography
?
 
<EOS>
of
what
class
be
their
previous
victim
,
and
how
victimise
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
do
they
get
,
and
<EOS>
how
do
they
pay
for
,
that
large
collection
of
likeness
,
all
purport
to
have
be
take
inside
,
with
the
taking
of
none
of
which
have
that
establishment
any
more
to
do
than
with
the
taking

Delhi
?
   
<EOS>
but
,
these
be
small
oasis
,
and
I
be
soon
back
again
in
metropolitan
Arcadia
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
impression
that
much
of
its
serene
and
peaceful
character
be
attributable
to
the
absence
of
customary
talk
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
<EOS>
but
there
may
be
subtle
influence
in
Talk
,
to
vex
the
soul
of
man
who
do
not
hear
it
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
but
that
talk
,
five
,
ten
,
twenty
mile
off
,
may
get
into
the
air
and
disagree
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
rise
from
my
bed
,
vaguely
troubled
and
wearied
and
sick
of
my
life
,
in
the
session
of
Parliament
,
who
shall
say
that
my
noble
friend
,
my
right
reverend
friend
,
my
right
honourable
friend
,
my
honourable
friend
,
my
honourable
and
learn
friend
,
or
my
honourable
and
gallant
friend
,
may
not
be
responsible
for
that
effect
upon
my
nervous
system
?
 
<EOS>
too
much
Ozone
in
the
air
,
I
be
informed
and
fully
believe
(
though
I
have
no
idea
what
it
be
)
,
would
affect
me
in
a
marvellously
disagreeable
way
;
why
may
not
too
much
talk
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
or
hear
the
ozone
;
I
do
not
see
or
hear
the
talk
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
so
much
talk
;
so
much
too
much
;
<EOS>
such
loud
cry
,
and
such
scant
supply
of
wool
;
such
a
deal
of
fleece
,
and
so
little
fleece
!
 
<EOS>
hence
,
in
the
arcadian
season
,
I
find
it
a
delicious
triumph
to
walk
down
to
desert
Westminster
,
and
see
the
Courts
shut
up
;
to
walk
a
little
further
and
see
the
two
Houses
shut
up
;
to
stand
in
the
Abbey
Yard
,
like
the
New

of
the
grand
English
history
(
concern
which
unfortunate
man
,
a
whole
rookery
of
mare

nest
be
generally
be
discover
)
,
and
gloat
upon
the
ruin
of
Talk
.
 
<EOS>
return
to
my
primitive
solitude
and
lie
down
to
sleep
,
my
grateful
heart
expand
with
the
consciousness
that
there
be
no
adjourn
debate
,
no
ministerial
explanation
,
nobody
to
give
notice
of
intention
to
ask
the
noble
Lord
at
the
head
of
her
Majesty
's
Government
five

and

twenty
bootless
question
in
one

no

with
legal

,
no
Nisi

with
eloquent
appeal
to
British

;
that
the
air
will
to

morrow
,
and
to

morrow
,
and
to

morrow
,
remain
untroubled
by
this
superabundant
generating
of
Talk
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
minor
degree
it
be
a
delicious
triumph
to
me
to
go
into
the
club
,
and
see
the
carpet
up
,
and
the
Bores
and
the
other
dust
disperse
to
the
four
wind

<EOS>
again
,
New

-
like
,
I
stand
on
the
cold
hearth
,
and
say
in
the
solitude
,
"
here
I
watch
Bore
A

with
voice
always
mysteriously
low
and
head
always
mysteriously

whisper
political
secret

confide
child

<EOS>
accurse
be
his

"
   
<EOS>
but
,
I
have
all
this

be
come
to
the
point
,
that
the
happy
nature
of
my
retirement
be
most
sweetly
express
in
its

the
abode
of
Love
.
 
<EOS>
It
be

an

<EOS>
nobody

everybody

<EOS>
the
one
great
result
of
the
resumption
of
primitive
habit
,
and
(
convertible
term

<EOS>
the
not
have
much
to
do
,
be
,
the
abounding
of
Love
.
   
<EOS>
the
Klem
specie
be
incapable
of
the
soft
emotion
;
probably
,
in
that
low
nomadic
race
,
the
soft
emotion
have
all
degenerate
into
flue
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
with
this
exception
,
all
the
sharer
of
my
retreat
make
love
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
mention
Saville

row

<EOS>
We
all
know
the
doctor

<EOS>
We
all
know
what
a
respectable
man
he
be
,
what
a
hard
dry
man

what
a
firm
man

what
a
confidential
man
:
 
how
he
let
us
into
the
waiting

like
a
man
who
know
minutely
what
be
the
matter
with
us

but
from
whom
the
rack
should
not
wring
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
prosaic
"
season
,
"
he
have
distinctly
the
appearance
of
a
man
conscious
of
money
in
the
saving
bank
,
and
take
his
stand
on
his
respectability
with
both
foot

<EOS>
at
that
time
it
be
as
impossible
to
associate
him
with
relaxation
,
or
any
human
weakness
,
as
it
be
to
meet
his
eye
without
feel
guilty
of
indisposition

<EOS>
in
the
bl
arcadian
time

how
change

<EOS>
I
have
see
him

in

salt
jacket

drab

with
his
arm
round

<EOS>
I
have
see
him
at

unsolicitedly

<EOS>
be
---
if
I
may
be

original

a
model

<EOS>
I
have
see
him
try
the
piano
in
the
Doctor

drawing

room
with
his
forefinger
,
and
have
hear
him
hum
tune
in
praise
of
lovely
woman

<EOS>
I
have
see
him
seat
on
a
fire

engine
,
and
go
(
obviously
in
search
of
excitement
)
to
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
one
moonlight
evening
when
the
peace
and
purity
of
our
arcadian
west
be
at
their
height
,
polk
with
the

I

<EOS>
I
accept

discharge
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
sirocco
have

it
be
a
hot
unwholesome
evening
with
no

<EOS>
mosquito
and
fire

sit

<EOS>
everybody

<EOS>
vesper

over

not

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
in
an
italian
town
he
be
always
at
work

and
always
thump
in
the
deadly
manner

<EOS>
I
keep
straight
on
,
and
come
in
due
time
to
the
first
on
the
right
:
a
narrow
dull
street
,
where
I
see
a
well
-
favour
man
of
good
stature
and
military
bearing
,
in
a
great
cloak
,
stand
at
a
door
.
<EOS>
draw
nearer
to
this
threshold
,
I
see
it
be
the
threshold
of
a
small
wine
-
shop
;
and
I
can
just
make
out
,
in
the
dim
light
,
the
inscription
that
it
be
keep
by
Giovanni
Carlavero
.
   
<EOS>
I
touch
my
hat
to
the
figure
in
the
cloak
,
and
pass
in
,
and
draw
a
stool
to
a
little
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
lamp
(
just
such
another
as
they
dig
out
of
Pompeii
)
be
light
,
but
the
place
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
in
the
cloak
have
follow
me
in
,
and
stand
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
master
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
at
your
service
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
please
to
give
me
a
glass
of
the
wine
of
the
country
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
turn
to
a
little
counter
,
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
his
striking
face
be
pale
,
and
his
action
be
evidently
that
of
an
enfeebled
man
<EOS>
,
I
remark
that
I
fear
he
have
be
ill
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
,
he
courteously
and
gravely
answer
,
though
bad
while
it
last
:
 
the
fever
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
set
the
wine
on
the
little
table
,
to
his
manif
surprise
I
lay
my
hand
on
the
back
of
his
,
look
him
in
the
face
,
and
say
in
a
low
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
an
Englishman
,
and
you
be
acquaint
with
a
friend
of
mine

<EOS>
do
you
recollect
---
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
mention
the
name
of
my
generous
countryman
.
   
<EOS>
instantly
,
he
utter
a
loud
cry
,
burst
into
tear
,
and
fall
on
his
knee
at
my
foot
,
clasp
my
leg
in
both
his
arm
and
bow
his
head
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
some
year
ago
,
this
man
at
my
foot
,
whose
over
-
fraught
heart
be
heave
as
if
it
would
burst
from
his
breast
,
and
whose
tear
be
wet
upon
the
dress
I
wear
,
be
a
galley
-
slave
in
the
North
of
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
political
offender
,
have
be
concern
in
the
then
last
rise
,
and
be
sentence
to
imprisonment
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
would
have
die
in
his
chain
,
be
certain
,
but
for
the
circumstance
that
the
Englishman
happen
to
visit
his
prison
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
vile
old
prison
of
Italy
,
and
<EOS>
a
part
of
it
be
below
the
water
of
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
of
his
confinement
be
an
arched
under
-
ground
and
under
-
water
gallery
,
with
a
grill
-
gate
at
the
entrance
,
through
which
it
receive
such
light
and
air
as
it
get
.
 
<EOS>
Its
condition
be
insufferably
foul
,
and
a
stranger
could
hardly
breathe
in
it
,
or
see
in
it
with
the
aid
of
a
torch
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
upper
end
of
this
dungeon
,
and
consequently
in
the
bad
position
,
as
be
the
furthest
remove
from
light
and
air
,
the
Englishman
first
beheld
him
,
sit
on
an
iron
bedstead
to
which
he
be
chain
by
a
heavy
chain
.
 
<EOS>
His
countenance
impress
the
Englishmen
as
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
face
of
the
malefactor
with
whom
he
be
associate
,
and
he
talk
with
him
,
and
learn
how
he
come
to
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
Englishman
emerge
from
the
dreadful
den
into
the
light
of
day
,
he
ask
his
conductor
,
the
governor
of
the
jail
,
why
Giovanni
Carlavero
be
put
into
the
bad
place
?
   
<EOS>
"
because
he
be
particularly
recommend
,
"
be
the
stringent
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
recommend
,
that
be
to
say
,
for
death
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
;
particularly
recommend
,
"
be
again
the
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
bad
tumour
in
his
neck
,
no
doubt
occasion
by
the
hardship
of
his
miserable
life
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
continue
to
be
neglect
,
and
he
remain
where
he
be
,
it
will
kill
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
I
can
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
particularly
recommend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Englishman
be
stay
in
that
town
,
and
he
go
to
his
home
there
;
but
the
figure
of
this
man
chain
to
the
bedstead
make
it
no
home
,
and
destroy
his
rest
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
Englishman
of
an
extraordinarily
tender
heart
,
and
he
could
not
bear
the
picture
.
<EOS>
He
go
back
to
the
prison
grate
;
go
back
again
and
again
,
and
talk
to
the
man
and
cheer
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
his
utmost
influence
to
get
the
man
unchained
from
the
bedstead
,
be
it
only
for
ever
so
short
a
time
in
the
day
,
and
permit
to
come
to
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
a
long
time
,
but
the
Englishman
's
station
,
personal
character
,
and
steadiness
of
purpose
,
wear
out
opposition
so
far
,
and
that
grace
be
at
last
accord
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
bar
,
when
he
could
thus
get
light
upon
the
tumour
,
the
Englishman
lance
it
,
and
it
do
well
,
and
heal
.
 
<EOS>
His
strong
interest
in
the
prisoner
have
greatly
increase
by
this
time
,
and
he
form
the
desperate
resolution
that
he
would
exert
his
utmost
self
-
devotion
and
use
his
utmost
effort
,
to
get
Carlavero
pardon
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
prisoner
have
be
a
brigand
and
a
murderer
,
if
he
have
commit
every
non
-
political
crime
in
the
Newgate
Calendar
and
out
of
it
,
nothing
would
have
be
easy
than
for
a
man
of
any
court
or
priestly
influence
to
obtain
his
release
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
nothing
could
have
be
more
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
italian
authority
,
and
english
authority
who
have
interest
with
them
,
alike
assure
the
Englishman
that
his
object
be
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
He
meet
with
nothing
but
evasion
,
refusal
,
and
ridicule
.
 
<EOS>
His
political
prisoner
become
a
joke
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
especially
observable
that
English
Circumlocution
,
and
English
Society
on
its
travel
,
be
as
humorous
on
the
subject
as
Circumlocution
and
Society
may
be
on
any
subject
without
loss
of
caste
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
Englishman
possess
(
and
prove
it
well
in
his
life
)
<EOS>
a
courage
very
uncommon
among
us
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
not
the
least
fear
of
be
consider
a
bore
,
in
a
good
humane
cause
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
persistently
try
,
and
try
,
and
try
,
to
get
Giovanni
Carlavero
out
.
 
<EOS>
that
prisoner
have
be
rigorously
re
-
chain
,
after
the
tumour
operation
,
and
it
be
not
likely
that
his
miserable
life
could
last
very
long
.
   
<EOS>
one
day
,
when
all
the
town
know
about
the
Englishman
and
his
political
prisoner
,
there
come
to
the
Englishman
,
a
certain
sprightly
italian
advocate
of
whom
he
have
some
knowledge
;
and
he
make
this
strange
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
give
me
a
hundred
pound
to
obtain
Carlavero
's
release
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
get
him
a
pardon
,
with
that
money
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
tell
you
what
I
be
go
to
do
with
the
money
,
nor
must
you
ever
ask
me
the
question
if
I
succeed
,
nor
must
you
ever
ask
me
for
an
account
of
the
money
if
I
fail
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Englishman
decide
to
hazard
the
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
and
hear
not
another
word
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
for
half
a
year
and
more
,
the
Advocate
make
no
sign
,
and
never
once
"
take
on
"
in
any
way
,
to
have
the
subject
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
Englishman
be
then
oblige
to
change
his
residence
to
another
and
more
famous
town
in
the
North
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
He
part
from
the
poor
prisoner
with
a
sorrowful
heart
,
as
from
a
doomed
man
for
whom
there
be
no
release
but
death
.
   
<EOS>
the
Englishman
live
in
his
new
place
of
abode
another
half
-
year
and
more
,
and
have
no
tiding
of
the
wretched
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
day
,
he
receive
from
the
Advocate
a
cool
,
concise
,
mysterious
note
,
to
this
effect
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
still
wish
to
bestow
that
benefit
upon
the
man
in
whom
you
be
once
interested
,
send
me
fifty
pound
more
,
and
I
think
it
can
be
ensure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
Englishman
have
long
settle
in
his
mind
that
the
Advocate
be
a
heartless
sharp
,
who
have
prey
upon
his
credulity
and
his
interest
in
an
unfortunate
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
sit
down
and
write
a
dry
answer
,
give
the
Advocate
to
understand
that
he
be
wise
now
than
he
have
be
formerly
,
and
that
no
more
money
be
extractable
from
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
He
live
outside
the
city
gate
,
some
mile
or
two
from
the
post
-
office
,
and
be
accustomed
to
walk
into
the
city
with
his
letter
and
post
them
himself
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
lovely
spring
day
,
when
the
sky
be
exquisitely
blue
,
and
the
sea
divinely
beautiful
,
he
take
his
usual
walk
,
carry
this
letter
to
the
Advocate
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
go
along
,
his
gentle
heart
be
much
move
by
the
loveliness
of
the
prospect
,
and
by
the
thought
of
the
slowly
die
prisoner
chain
to
the
bedstead
,
for
whom
the
universe
have
no
delight
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
draw
nearer
and
near
to
the
city
where
he
be
to
post
the
letter
,
he
become
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
debate
with
himself
,
be
it
remotely
possible
,
after
all
,
that
this
sum
of
fifty
pound
could
restore
the
fellow
-
creature
whom
he
pity
so
much
,
and
for
whom
he
have
strive
so
hard
,
to
liberty
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
conventionally
rich
Englishman
---
very
far
from
that
---
but
,
he
have
a
spare
fifty
pound
at
the
banker
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
risk
it
.
<EOS>
without
doubt
,
GOD
have
recompense
him
for
the
resolution
.
   
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
banker
's
,
and
get
a
bill
for
the
amount
,
and
enclose
it
in
a
letter
to
the
Advocate
that
I
wish
I
could
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
simply
tell
the
Advocate
that
he
be
quite
a
poor
man
,
and
that
he
be
sensible
it
may
be
a
great
weakness
in
him
to
part
with
so
much
money
on
the
faith
of
so
vague
a
communication
;
but
,
that
there
it
be
,
and
that
he
pray
the
Advocate
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
do
otherwise
no
good
could
ever
come
of
it
,
and
it
would
lie
heavy
on
his
soul
one
day
.
   
<EOS>
within
a
week
,
the
Englishman
be
sit
at
his
breakfast
,
when
he
hear
some
suppress
sound
of
agitation
on
the
staircase
,
and
Giovanni
Carlavero
leap
into
the
room
and
fall
upon
his
breast
,
a
free
man
!
   
<EOS>
conscious
of
have
wrong
the
Advocate
in
his
own
thought
,
the
Englishman
write
him
an
earnest
and
grateful
letter
,
avow
the
fact
,
and
entreat
him
to
confide
by
what
mean
and
through
what
agency
he
have
succeed
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
Advocate
return
for
answer
through
the
post
,
"
there
be
many
thing
,
as
you
know
,
in
this
Italy
of
our
,
that
be
safe
and
good
not
even
speak
of
---
far
less
write
of
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
meet
some
day
,
and
then
I
may
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
;
not
here
,
and
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
two
never
do
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
Advocate
be
dead
when
the
Englishman
give
me
my
trust
;
and
how
the
man
have
be
set
free
,
remain
as
great
a
mystery
to
the
Englishman
,
and
to
the
man
himself
,
as
it
be
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
I
know
this
:
---
<EOS>
here
be
the
man
,
this
sultry
night
,
on
his
knee
at
my
foot
,
because
I
be
the
Englishman
's
friend
;
here
be
his
tear
upon
my
dress
;
here
be
his
sobs
choke
his
utterance
;
here
be
his
kiss
on
my
hand
,
because
they
have
touch
the
hand
that
have
work
out
his
release
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
need
to
tell
me
it
would
be
happiness
to
him
to
die
for
his
benefactor
;
I
doubt
if
I
ever
see
real
,
sterling
,
fervent
gratitude
of
soul
,
before
or
since
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
much
watch
and
suspect
,
he
say
,
and
have
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
himself
out
of
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
and
his
not
have
prosper
in
his
worldly
affair
,
have
lead
to
his
have
fail
in
his
usual
communication
to
the
Englishman
for
---
as
I
now
remember
the
period
---
some
two
or
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
his
prospect
be
bright
,
and
his
wife
who
have
be
very
ill
have
recover
,
and
his
fever
have
leave
him
,
and
he
have
buy
a
little
vineyard
,
and
would
I
carry
to
his
benefactor
the
first
of
its
wine
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
I
would
(
I
tell
him
with
enthusiasm
)
,
and
not
a
drop
of
it
should
be
spill
or
lose
!
   
<EOS>
He
have
cautiously
close
the
door
before
speak
of
himself
,
and
have
talk
with
such
excess
of
emotion
,
and
in
a
provincial
Italian
so
difficult
to
understand
,
that
I
have
more
than
once
be
oblige
to
stop
him
,
and
beg
him
to
have
compassion
on
me
and
be
slow
and
calm
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
he
become
so
,
and
tranquilly
walk
back
with
me
to
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
I
sit
down
before
I
go
to
bed
and
write
a
faithful
account
of
him
to
the
Englishman
:
 
which
I
conclude
by
say
that
I
would
bring
the
wine
home
,
against
any
difficulty
,
every
drop
.
   
<EOS>
early
next
morning
,
when
I
come
out
at
the
hotel
door
to
pursue
my
journey
,
I
find
my
friend
wait
with
one
of
those
immense
bottle
in
which
the
italian
peasant
store
their
wine
---
a
bottle
hold
some
half
-
dozen
gallon
---
bind
round
with
basket
-
work
for
great
safety
on
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
in
the
bright
sunshine
,
tear
of
gratitude
in
his
eye
,
proudly
invite
my
attention
to
this
corpulent
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
(
at
the
street
-
comer
hard
by
,
two
high
-
flavoured
,
able
-
bodied
monk
---
pretend
to
talk
together
,
but
keep
their
four
evil
eye
upon
us
.
)
   
<EOS>
how
the
bottle
have
be
get
there
,
do
not
appear
;
but
the
difficulty
of
get
it
into
the
ramshackle
vetturino
carriage
in
which
I
be
depart
,
be
so
great
,
and
it
take
up
so
much
room
when
it
be
get
in
,
that
I
elect
to
sit
outside
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
I
see
of
Giovanni
Carlavero
be
his
running
through
the
town
by
the
side
of
the
jingling
wheel
,
clasp
my
hand
as
I
stretch
it
down
from
the
box
,
charge
me
with
a
thousand
last
loving
and
dutiful
message
to
his
dear
patron
,
and
finally
look
in
at
the
bottle
as
it
repose
inside
,
with
an
admiration
of
its
honourable
way
of
travel
that
be
beyond
measure
delightful
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
what
disquiet
of
mind
this
dearly
-
beloved
and
highly
-
treasure
Bottle
begin
to
cost
me
,
no
man
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
precious
charge
through
a
long
tour
,
and
,
for
hundred
of
mile
,
I
never
have
it
off
my
mind
by
day
or
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
over
bad
road
---
and
they
be
many
---
I
cling
to
it
with
affectionate
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
up
mountain
,
I
look
in
at
it
and
see
it
helplessly
tilt
over
on
its
back
,
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
at
innumerable
inn
door
when
the
weather
be
bad
,
I
be
oblige
to
be
put
into
my
vehicle
before
the
Bottle
could
be
get
in
,
and
be
oblige
to
have
the
Bottle
lift
out
before
human
aid
could
come
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
Imp
of
the
same
name
,
except
that
his
association
be
all
evil
and
these
association
be
all
good
,
would
have
be
a
less
troublesome
travel
companion
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
serve
Mr
Cruikshank
as
a
subject
for
a
new
illustration
of
the
misery
of
the
Bottle
.
 
<EOS>
the
National
Temperance
Society
may
have
make
a
powerful
tract
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
the
suspicion
that
attach
to
this
innocent
Bottle
,
greatly
aggravate
my
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
apple
-
pie
in
the
child
's
book
.
 
<EOS>
Parma
pout
at
it
,
Modena
mock
it
<EOS>
,
Tuscany
tackle
it
,
Naples
nibble
it
<EOS>
,
Rome
refuse
it
,
Austria
accuse
it
,
soldier
suspect
it
,
Jesuits
job
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
compose
a
neat
Oration
,
develop
my
inoffensive
intention
in
connexion
with
this
Bottle
,
and
deliver
it
in
an
infinity
of
guard
-
house
,
at
a
multitude
of
town
gate
,
and
on
every
drawbridge
,
angle
,
and
rampart
,
of
a
complete
system
of
fortification
.
 
<EOS>
fifty
time
a
day
,
I
get
down
to
harangue
an
infuriate
soldiery
about
the
Bottle
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
filthy
degradation
of
the
abject
and
vile
Roman
States
,
I
have
as
much
difficulty
in
work
my
way
with
the
Bottle
,
as
if
it
have
bottle
up
a
complete
system
of
heretical
theology
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Neapolitan
country
,
where
everybody
be
a
spy
,
a
soldier
,
a
priest
,
or
a
lazzarone
,
the
shameless
beggar
of
all
four
denomination
incessantly
pounce
on
the
Bottle
and
make
it
a
pretext
for
extort
money
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
quire
---
quire
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
ream
---
of
form
illegibly
print
on
whity
-
brown
paper
be
fill
up
about
the
Bottle
,
and
it
be
the
subject
of
more
stamp
and
sand
than
I
have
ever
see
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
which
haze
of
sand
,
perhaps
,
it
be
always
irregular
,
and
always
latent
with
dismal
penalty
of
go
back
or
not
go
forward
,
which
be
only
to
be
abate
by
the
silver
crossing
of
a
base
hand
,
poke
shirtless
out
of
a
ragged
uniform
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
under
all
discouragement
,
however
,
I
stick
to
my
Bottle
,
and
hold
firm
to
my
resolution
that
every
drop
of
its
content
should
reach
the
Bottle
's
destination
.
   
<EOS>
the
latter
refinement
cost
me
a
separate
heap
of
trouble
on
its
own
separate
account
.
 
<EOS>
what
corkscrews
do
I
see
the
military
power
bring
out
against
that
Bottle
;
what
gimlet
,
spike
,
divine
rod
,
gauge
,
and
unknown
test
and
instrument
!
 
<EOS>
at
some
place
,
they
persist
in
declare
that
the
wine
must
not
be
pass
,
without
be
open
and
taste
;
I
,
plead
to
the
contrary
,
use
then
to
argue
the
question
seat
on
the
Bottle
lest
they
should
open
it
in
spite
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
southern
part
of
Italy
more
violent
shrieking
,
face
-
making
,
and
gesticulate
,
great
vehemence
of
speech
and
countenance
and
action
,
go
on
about
that
Bottle
than
would
attend
fifty
murder
in
a
northern
latitude
.
 
<EOS>
It
raise
important
functionary
out
of
their
bed
,
in
the
dead
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
half
-
a
-
dozen
military
lantern
to
disperse
themselves
at
all
point
of
a
great
sleeping
Piazza
,
each
lantern
summon
some
official
creature
to
get
up
,
put
on
his
cock
-
hat
instantly
,
and
come
and
stop
the
Bottle
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
characteristic
that
while
this
innocent
Bottle
have
such
immense
difficulty
in
get
from
little
town
to
town
,
Signor
Mazzini
and
the
fiery
cross
be
traverse
Italy
from
end
to
end
.
   
<EOS>
still
,
I
stick
to
my
Bottle
,
like
any
fine
old
english
gentleman
all
of
the
olden
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
the
Bottle
be
interfere
with
,
the
stauncher
I
become
(
if
possible
)
<EOS>
in
my
first
determination
that
my
countryman
should
have
it
deliver
to
him
intact
,
as
the
man
whom
he
have
so
nobly
restore
to
life
and
liberty
have
deliver
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
I
have
be
obstinate
in
my
day
---
and
I
may
have
be
,
say
,
once
or
twice
<EOS>
---
I
be
obstinate
about
the
Bottle
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
make
it
a
rule
always
to
keep
a
pocket
full
of
small
coin
at
its
service
,
and
never
to
be
out
of
temper
in
its
cause
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
I
and
the
Bottle
make
our
way
.
 
<EOS>
once
we
have
a
break
-
down
;
rather
a
bad
break
-
down
,
on
a
steep
high
place
with
the
sea
below
us
,
on
a
tempestuous
evening
when
it
blow
great
gun
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
drive
four
wild
horse
abreast
,
southern
fashion
,
and
there
be
some
little
difficulty
in
stop
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
outside
,
and
not
throw
off
;
but
no
word
can
describe
my
feeling
when
I
see
the
bottle
---
travel
inside
,
as
usual
---
<EOS>
burst
the
door
open
,
and
roll
obesely
out
into
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
a
bless
Bottle
with
a
charm
existence
<EOS>
,
he
take
no
hurt
,
and
we
repair
damage
,
and
go
on
triumphant
.
   
<EOS>
a
thousand
representation
be
make
to
me
that
the
Bottle
must
be
leave
at
this
place
,
or
that
,
and
call
for
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
yield
to
one
of
them
,
and
never
part
from
the
Bottle
,
on
any
pretence
,
consideration
,
threat
,
or
entreaty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
faith
in
any
official
receipt
for
the
Bottle
,
and
nothing
would
induce
me
to
accept
one
.
<EOS>
these
unmanageable
politic
at
last
bring
me
and
the
Bottle
,
still
triumphant
,
to
Genoa
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
I
take
a
tender
and
reluctant
leave
of
him
for
a
few
week
,
and
consign
him
to
a
trusty
english
captain
,
to
be
convey
to
the
Port
of
London
by
sea
.
   
<EOS>
while
the
Bottle
be
on
his
voyage
to
England
,
I
read
the
Shipping
Intelligence
as
anxiously
as
if
I
have
be
an
underwriter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
stormy
weather
after
I
myself
have
get
to
England
by
way
of
Switzerland
and
France
,
and
my
mind
greatly
misgave
me
that
the
Bottle
may
be
wreck
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
to
my
great
joy
,
I
receive
notice
of
his
safe
arrival
,
and
immediately
go
down
to
Saint
Katharine
's
Docks
,
and
find
him
in
a
state
of
honourable
captivity
in
the
Custom
House
.
   
<EOS>
the
wine
be
mere
vinegar
when
I
set
it
down
before
the
generous
Englishman
---
probably
it
have
be
something
like
vinegar
when
I
take
it
up
from
Giovanni
Carlavero
---
but
not
a
drop
of
it
be
spill
or
go
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
Englishman
tell
me
,
with
much
emotion
in
his
face
and
voice
,
that
he
have
never
taste
wine
that
seem
to
him
so
sweet
and
sound
.
 
<EOS>
and
long
afterwards
,
the
Bottle
grace
his
table
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
last
time
I
see
him
in
this
world
that
miss
him
<EOS>
,
he
take
me
aside
in
a
crowd
,
to
say
,
with
his
amiable
smile
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
talk
of
you
only
to
-
day
at
dinner
,
and
I
wish
you
have
be
there

in

<EOS>
It
be
an
unsettled
question
with
me
whether
I
shall
leave
Calais
something
handsome
in
my
will
,
or
whether
I
shall
leave
it
my
malediction
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
it
so
much
,
and
yet
I
be
always
so
very
glad
to
see
it
,
that
I
be
in
a
state
of
constant
indecision
on
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
first
make
acquaintance
with
Calais
,
it
be
as
a
maunder
young
wretch
in
a
clammy
perspiration
and
dripping
saline
particle
,
who
be
conscious
of
no
extremity
but
the
one
great
extremity
,
sea
-
sickness
---
who
be
a
mere
bilious
torso
,
with
a
mislaid
headache
somewhere
in
its
stomach
---
who
have
be
put
into
a
horrible
swing
in
Dover
Harbour
,
and
have
tumble
giddily
out
of
it
on
the
french
coast
,
or
the
Isle
of
Man
,
or
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
time
have
change
,
and
now
I
enter
Calais
self
-
reliant
and
rational
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
where
it
be
beforehand
,
I
keep
a
look
out
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
recognise
its
landmark
when
I
see
any
of
them
,
I
be
acquaint
with
its
way
,
and
I
know
<EOS>
---
and
I
can
bear

its
bad
behaviour
.

Malignant

<EOS>
in

Cape
Grinez
,
come
frankly
forth
into
the

,
exhort
<EOS>
the
failing
to
be
stout
of
heart
and
stomach
:
 
sneak
Calais
,
prone
behind
its
bar
,
invite
emetically
to
despair

<EOS>
even
when
it
can
no

quite
conceal
itself
in

muddy
dock
,
it
have
an
evil
way

fall
off

have
Calais

which
be

<EOS>

Calais
have
retire
mile
inland
,
and
Dover
have
burst
out
to
look
for
it

<EOS>
It
have
a
last
dip

slide
in
its
character

have
Calais

to

command

Thrice
accurse
be

come
up

league

two
to
the
right

with
the

shivering

spluttering
and
stare
about
for

<EOS>
not
but
what
I
have
my
animosity
towards
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
I
particularly
detest
Dover
for
the
self
-
complacency
with
which
it
go
to
bed

<EOS>
It
always
go
to
bed
(
when
I
be
go
to
Calais
)
with
a
more
brilliant
display
of
lamp
and
candle
than
any
other
town
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Birmingham
,
host
and
hostess
of
the
Lord
Warden
Hotel
,
be
my
much
esteem
friend
,
but
they
be
too
conceited
about
the
comfort
of
that
establishment
when
the
Night
Mail
be
start
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
a
good
house
to
stay
at
,
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
the
fact
insist
upon
in
all
its
warm
bright
window
at
such
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
Warden
be
a
stationary
edifice
that
never
roll
or
pitch
,
and
I
object
to
its
big
outline
seem
to
insist
upon
that
circumstance
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
to
come
over
me
with
it
,
when
I
be
reel
on

Beshrew
the

obstruct

make

angry

rush
round

Shall
I
not

that
it
blow
quite
soon

without

<EOS>
the

upon

go

I

rattle
taunt
against

<EOS>
I
can
not
disguise
from
my
uncommercial
mind
the
miserable
fact
that
we
be
a
body
of
outcast
;
that
the
attendant
on
us
be
as
scant
in
number
as
may
serve
to
get
rid

us
with

least
possible

that
there
be
no

interested

that

at

that

Lo

It

lie
about

for

I
can
not

the

I

very
vague

<EOS>
in
a
sweet
faint
temper

something
like
the
smell

I
think
I
should
feel
languidly
benevolent
if
I
have
time

<EOS>
I
have
not
time
,
because
I
be
under
a
curious
compulsion
to
occupy
myself
with
the
irish
melody

<EOS>
"

notice

I
do
not

it

to

envenomed

on
cottage

and
the
monotonous
noise
of

the
steady
jingle
of

<EOS>
Anon
,
the
intermittent
funnel
roar
of
protest
at
every
violent
roll
,
become
the
regular
blast
of
a
high
pressure
engine
,
and
I
recognise
the
exceedingly
explosive
steamer
in
which
I
ascend
the
Mississippi
when
the
american
civil
war
be
not
,
and
when
only
its
cause
be
.
 
<EOS>
a
fragment
of
mast
on
which
the
light
of
a
lantern
fall
,
an
end
of
rope
,
and
a
jerk
block
or
so
,
become
suggestive
of
Franconi
's
Circus
at
Paris
where
I
shall
be
this
very
night
mayhap
(
for
it
must
be
morning
now
)
,
and
they
dance
to
the
self
-
same
time
and
tune
as
the
train
steed
,
Black
Raven
.
<EOS>
what
may
be
the
speciality
of
these
wave
as
they
come
rush
on
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
desert
the
press
demand
make
upon
me
by
the
gem
she
wear
,
to
inquire
,
but
they
be
charge
with
something
about
Robinson
Crusoe
,
and
I
think
it
be
in
Yarmouth
Roads
that
he
first
go
a
seafaring
and
be
near
founder
(
what
a
terrific
sound
that
word
have
for
me
when
I
be
a

!
)
<EOS>
in
his
first
gale
of
wind
.
<EOS>
still
,
through
all
this
,
I
must
ask
her
(
who
be
she
<EOS>
I
wonder
!
)
<EOS>
for
the
fiftieth
time
,
and
without
ever
stop
,
do
she
not
fear
to
stray
,
so
lone
and
lovely
through
this
bleak
way
,
and
be
Erin
's
son
so
good
or
so
cold
,
as
not
to
be
tempt
by
more
fellow
-
creature
at
the
paddle
-
box
or
gold
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
Knight
<EOS>
I
feel
not
the
least
alarm
,
no
son
of
Erin
will
offer
me
harm
,
for
though
they
love
fellow
-
creature
with
umbrella
down
again
and
golden
store
,
Sir
Knight
<EOS>
they
<EOS>
what
a
tremendous
one
love
honour
and
virtue
more
:
 
<EOS>
for
though
they
love
stewards
with
a
bull
's
eye
bright
,
they
will
trouble
you
for
your
ticket
,
sir
-
rough
passage
to

night
!
   
<EOS>
I
freely
admit
it
to
be
a
miserable
piece
of
human
weakness
and
inconsistency
,
but
I
no
sooner
become
conscious
of
those
last
word
from
the
steward
than
I
begin
to
soften
towards
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
whereas
I
have
be
vindictively
wish
that
those
Calais
burgher
who
come
out
of
their
town
by
a
short
cut
into
the
history
of
England
,
with
those
fatal
rope
round
their
neck
by
which
they
have
since
be
tow
into
so
many
cartoon
,
have
all
be
hang
on
the
spot
,
I
now
begin
to
regard
them
as
highly
respectable
and
virtuous
tradesman
.
<EOS>
look
about
me
,
I
see
the
light
of
Cape
Grinez
well
astern
of
the
boat
on
the
davit
to
leeward
,
and
the
light
of
Calais
Harbour
undeniably
at
its
old
trick
,
but
still
ahead
and
shine
.
<EOS>
sentiment
of
forgiveness
of
Calais
,
not
to
say
of
attachment
to
Calais
,
begin
to
expand
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
weak
notion
that
I
will
stay
there
a
day
or
two
on
my
way
back
.
 
<EOS>
a
faded
and
recumbent
stranger
pause
in
a
profound
reverie
over
the
rim
of
a
basin
,
ask
me
what
kind
of
place
<EOS>
Calais
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
(
Heaven
forgive
me
!
)
<EOS>
a
very
agreeable
place
indeed
---
rather
hilly
than
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
so
strangely
go
the
time
,
and
on
the
whole
so
quickly
---
though
still
I
seem
to
have
be
on
board
a
week
---
that
I
be
bump
,
roll
,
gurgle
,
wash
and
pitch
into
Calais
Harbour
before
her
maiden
smile
have
finally
light
her
through
the
Green
Isle
,
when
blest
for
ever
be
she
who
rely
,
on
enter
Calais
at
the
top
of
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
for
we
have
not
to
land
to

night
down
among
those
slimy
timber
---
cover
with
green
hair
as
if
it
be
the
mermaids
'
favourite
combing
-
place
---
where
one
crawl
to
the
surface
of
the
jetty
,
like
a
stranded
shrimp
,
but
we
go
steam
up
the
harbour
to
the
Railway
Station
Quay
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
we
go
,
the
sea
wash
in
and
out
among
pile
and
plank
,
with
dead
heavy
beat
and
in
quite
a
furious
manner
<EOS>
(
whereof
we
be
proud
)
,
and
the
lamp
shake
in
the
wind
,
and
the
bell

strike
one
seem
to
send
their
vibration
struggle
against
troubled

,
as
we
have
come
struggle
against
troubled
water
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
in
the
sudden
relief
and
wiping
of
face
,
everybody
on
board
seem
to
have
have
a
prodigious
double

out

free

and
now
we
all
know
for
the

how
wet

who

;
the
other

a
young

with
a
very
small
bird
in

very
small

who
feed
the
small

with

put
him
up
in

his
head
,
where
he
advance
twitter

to

seem
to

me
in

<EOS>
the
compatriot
(
who
cross

whom
I

and

I
have
it
all
to

a

so
very

through

that

My

<EOS>
I
have
go
on
to

my

enlighten
me
occasionally
with
a
long
list
of
the
enormous
grievance
of
french
railway
travelling
:
 
every
one
of
which
,
as
I
be
a
sinner
,
be
perfectly
new
to
me

though
I
have
as
much
experience
of
french
railway
as
most
uncommercial
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
leave
him
at
the
terminus
<EOS>
(
through
his
conviction

against
all
explanation

remonstrance

that
his
baggage

,
insist
in

high

that
in

he

four

I
have
bathe
and
breakfast
,
and
be
stroll
on
the
bright
quay

<EOS>
the
subject
of
my
meditation
be
the
question
whether
it
be
positively
in
the
essence
and
nature
of
thing
,
as
a
certain
school
of
Britons
would
seem
to
think
it
,
that
a
capital
must
be
ensnare
and
enslave
before
it
can
be
make
beautiful
:
 
when
I
lift
up
my
eye
and
find
that
my
foot
,
stray
like
my
mind
,
have
bring
me
to
Notre

<EOS>
that

I
have
leave
that
space
cover
with
building
densely
crowd
;
and
now
it
be
clear
for
some
new
wonder
in
the
way
of
public
Street
,
Place
,
Garden
,
Fountain
,
or
all
four
.
 
<EOS>
only
the
obscene
little
Morgue
,
slink
on
the
brink
of
the
river
and
soon
to
come
down
,
be
leave
there
,
look
mortally
ashamed
of
itself
,
and
supremely
wicked
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
but
glance
at
this
old
acquaintance
,
when
I
beheld
an
airy
procession
come
round
in
front
of
Notre
-
Dame
,
past
the
great
hospital
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
something
of
a
Masaniello
look
,
with
flutter
stripe
curtain
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
it
come
dance
round
the
cathedral
in
the
lively
manner
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
speculate
on
a
marriage
in
blouse
-
life
,
or
a
Christening
,
or
some
other
domestic
festivity
which
I
would
see
out
,
<EOS>
when
I
find
,
from
the
talk
of
a
quick
rush
of
Blouses
past
me
,
that
it
be
a
body
come
to
the
Morgue
.
 
<EOS>
have
never
before
chance
upon
this
initiation
,
I
constitute
myself
a
Blouse
likewise
,
and
run
into
the
Morgue
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
muddy
day
,
and
we
take
in
a
quantity
of
mire
with
us
,
and
the
procession
come
in
upon
our

bring
a
quantity
more

<EOS>
the
procession
be
in

high
spirit
,
and
consist
of
idler
who
have
come
with
the
curtain
litter
from
its
start

place
,
and
of
all
the
reinforcement
it
have
pick
up
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
set
the
litter
down
in
the
midst
of
the
Morgue
,
and
then
two
Custodians
proclaim
aloud
that
we
be
all
"
invite
"
to
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
this
invitation
be
render
the
more
pressing
,
if
not
the
more
flattering
,
by
our
be
shove
out
,
and
the

be
bar
upon

.
   
<EOS>
those
who
have
never
see
the
Morgue

may
see
it
perfectly
,
by

themselves

It
look

<EOS>
Shut

it

Would
Monsieur

<EOS>
It

an

we

his

somebody
else

the

our
comfort
be

that
he
have
nothing

him

his

that
his

must
seek
him
here

perhaps
they

We

several

there
be
no

nothing

a

<EOS>
the

have
establish

very
remarkable

when
a

all
at

come
up
from

pinion
him
ignominiously

hurry
him
into

(

of

smoking
at

mention
pride

it
may

observe

by

that
one
could
not
well
help
invest
the
original
sole
occupant
of
the
front
row
with
an
air
depreciatory
of
the
legitimate
attraction
of
the
poor
old

while
the

seem
to
exult

this
superseded

pace
presently
round

Tower
of
St

presently
again
in

of
the
Hotel

,
I
call
to
mind
a
certain
desolate
open

air
Morgue
that
I
happen
to
light
upon
in
London
,
one
day
in
the
hard
winter
of
1861
,
and
which
seem
as
strange
to
me
,
at
the
time
of
see
it
,
as
if
I
have
find
it
in
China

<EOS>
towards
that
hour
of
a

afternoon
when
the
lamp

lighter

begin
to
light
the

in
the

a

because

thicken
fast

I
be
walk
in
from
the

on
the
northern

Regent

---
hard
frozen

when
I
see
an
empty

cab
drive
up
to
the
lodge
at
Gloucester

gate
,
and
the
driver
with
great
agitation
call
to
the
man
there
:
who
quickly
reach
a
long
pole
from
a
tree
,
and
,
deftly
collar
by
the
driver
,
jump
to
the
step
of
his
little
seat
,
and
so
the
Hansom
rattle
out
at
the
gate
,
gallop
over
the
iron

bind
road
.

I
follow

that

<EOS>
so
dreadfully
forlorn
,
so
dreadfully
sad
<EOS>
,
so
dreadfully
mysterious
,
this
spectacle
of
our
dear
sister
here
depart
!
 
<EOS>
a
barge
come
up
,
break
the
float
ice
and
the
silence

and
a
woman
steer
it

<EOS>
the
man
with
the
horse

care
so
little
for
the

that
the

hoofs
have
be

the

the

take
him
to

<EOS>
at
which
sound
the
steering
woman
look
up
at
us
on
the
bridge
,
with
contempt
unutterable
,
and
then
look
down
at
the
body
with
a
similar
expression
---
as
if

<EOS>
a
well
experience
,
but
also
of
the
Morgue
kind
,
in
which
chance
happily
make
me
useful
in
a
slight
degree
,
arise
to
my
remembrance
as
I
take
my
way
by
the
Boulevard
de
Sebastopol
to
the
bright
scene
of
Paris
.
   
<EOS>
the
thing
happen
,
say
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
modest
young
uncommercial
then
,
and
timid
and
inexperienced
.
 
<EOS>
many
sun
and
wind
have
brown
me
in
the
line
,
but
those
be
my
pale
day
.
<EOS>
have
newly
take
the
lease
of
a
house
in
a
certain
distinguished
metropolitan
parish
---
a
house
which
then
appear
to
me
to
be
a
frightfully
first
-
class
Family
Mansion
,
involve
awful
responsibility
---
I
become
the
prey
of
a
Beadle
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
Beadle
must
have
see
me
go
in
or
come
out
,
and
must
have
observe
that
I
totter
under
the
weight
of
my
grandeur
.
 
<EOS>
or
he
may
have
be
in
hide
under
straw
when
I
buy
my
first
horse
(
in
the
desirable
stable
-
yard
attach
to
the
first
-
class
Family
Mansion
)
,
and
<EOS>
when
the
vendor
remark
to
me
,
in
an
original
manner
,
on
bring
him
for
approval
,
take
his
cloth
off
and
smack
him
,
"
there
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
orse
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
gallantly
,
"
how
much
do
you
want
for
him
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
the
vendor
say
,
"
no
more
than
sixty
guinea
,
from
you
,
"
and
when
I
say
smartly
,
"
why
not
more
than
sixty
from
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
say
crushingly
,
"
because
upon
my
soul
and
body
he
would
be
consider
cheap
at
seventy
,
by
one
who
understand
the
subject
---
but
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
---
I
say
,
the
Beadle
may
have
be
in
hide
under
straw
,
when
this
disgrace
befall
me
,
or
he
may
have
note
that
I
be
too
raw
and
young
an
Atlas
to
carry
the
first
-
class
Family
Mansion
in
a
knowing
manner
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
the
Beadle
do
what
Melancholy
do
to
the
youth
in
Gray
's
Elegy
---
he
mark
me
for
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
way
in
which
the
Beadle
do
it
<EOS>
,
be
this
:
 
he
summon
me
as
a
Juryman
on
his
Coroner
's
inquest
.
   
<EOS>
in
my
first
feverish
alarm
I
repair
"
for
safety
and
for
succour
"
---
like
those
sagacious
northern
shepherd
who
,
have
have
no
previous
reason
whatever
to
believe
in
young
Norval
,
very
prudently
do
not
originate
the
hazardous
idea
of
believe
in
him
---
to
a
deep
householder
.
 
<EOS>
this
profound
man
inform
me
that
the
Beadle
count
on
my
buy
him
off
;
on
my
bribe
him
not
to
summon
me
;
and
that
if
I
would
attend
an
Inquest
with
a
cheerful
countenance
,
and
profess
alacrity
in
that
branch
of
my
country
's
service
,
the
Beadle
would
be
dishearten
,
and
would
give
up
the
game
.
   
<EOS>
I
rouse
my
energy
,
and
the
next
time
the
wily
Beadle
summon
me
,
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
Beadle
be
the
blank
Beadle
I
have
ever
look
on
when
I
answer
to
my
name
;
and
his
discomfiture
give
me
courage
to
go
through
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
impanel
to
inquire
concern
the
death
of
a
very
little
mite
of
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
old
miserable
story
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
mother
have
commit
the
minor
offence
of
conceal
the
birth
,
or
whether
she
have
commit
the
major
offence
of
kill
the
child
,
be
the
question
on
which
we
be
want
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
commit
her
on
one
of
the
two
issue
.
   
<EOS>
the
Inquest
come
off
in
the
parish
workhouse
,
and
I
have
yet
a
lively
impression
that
I
be
unanimously
receive
by
my
brother
Jurymen
as
a
brother
of
the
utmost
conceivable
insignificance
.
<EOS>
also
,
that
before
we
begin
,
a
broker
who
have
lately
cheat
me
fearfully
in
the
matter
of
a
pair
of
card
-
table
,
be
for
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
we
sit
in
a
sort
of
board
-
room
,
on
such
very
large
square
horse
-
hair
chair
that
I
wonder
what
race
of
patagonian
they
be
make
for
;
and
further
,
that
an
undertaker
give
me
his
card
when
we
be
in
the
full
moral
freshness
of
have
just
be
swear
,
as
"
an
inhabitant
that
be
newly
come
into
the
parish
,
and
be
likely
to
have
a
young
family
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
case
be
then
state
to
us
by
the
Coroner
,
and
then
we
go
down
-
stair
---
lead
by
the
plot
beadle
---
to
view
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
day
to
this
,
the
poor
little
figure
,
on
which
that
sound
legal
appellation
be
bestow
,
have
lie
in
the
same
place
and
with
the
same
surrounding
,
to
my
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
kind
of
crypt
devote
to
the
warehousing
of
the
parochial
coffin
,
and
in
the
midst
of
a
perfect
Panorama
of
coffin
of
all
size
,
it
be
stretch
on
a
box
;
the
mother
have
put
it
in
her
box
---
this
box
---
almost
as
soon
as
it
be
bear
,
and
it
have
be
presently
find
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
open
,
and
neatly
sew
up
,
and
regard
from
that
point
of
view
,
it
look
like
a
stuff
creature
.
 
<EOS>
It
rest
on
a
clean
white
cloth
,
with
a
surgical
instrument
or
so
at
hand
,
and
regard
from
that
point
of
view
<EOS>
,
it
look
as
if
the
cloth
be
"
lay
,
"
and
the
Giant
be
come
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
repellent
about
the
poor
piece
of
innocence
,
and
it
demand
a
mere
form
of
look
at
.
<EOS>
so
,
we
look
at
an
old
pauper
who
be
go
about
among
the
coffin
with
a
foot
rule
,
as
if
he
be
a
case
of
Self
-
Measurement
;
and
we
look
at
one
another
;
and
we
say
the
place
be
well
whitewash
anyhow
;
and
then
our
conversational
power
as
a
British
Jury
flag
,
and
the
foreman
say
,
"
all
right
,
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
back
again
,
Mr
Beadle
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
miserable
young
creature
who
have
give
birth
to
this
child
within
a
very
few
day
,
and
who
have
clean
the
cold
wet
door
-
step
immediately
afterwards
,
be
bring
before
us
when
we
resume
our
horse
-
hair
chair
,
and
be
present
during
the
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
horse
-
hair
chair
herself
,
be
very
weak
and
ill
;
and
I
remember
how
she
turn
to
the
unsympathetic
nurse
who
attend
her
,
and
who
may
have
be
the
figure
-
head
of
a
pauper
-
ship
,
and
how
she
hide
her
face
and
sobs
and
tear
upon
that
wooden
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
too
,
how
hard
her
mistress
be
upon
her
(
she
be
a
servant
-
of
-
all
-
work
)
,
and
with
what
a
cruel
pertinacity
that
piece
of
Virtue
spin
her
thread
of
evidence
double
,
by
intertwiste
it
with
the
stern
thread
of
construction
.
 
<EOS>
Smitten
hard
by
the
terrible
low
wail
from
the
utterly
friendless
orphan
girl
,
which
never
cease
during
the
whole
inquiry
<EOS>
,
I
take
heart
to
ask
this
witness
a
question
or
two
,
which
hopefully
admit
of
an
answer
that
may
give
a
favourable
turn
to
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
the
turn
as
little
favourable
as
it
could
be
,
but
it
do
some
good
,
and
the
Coroner
,
who
be
nobly
patient
and
humane
<EOS>
(
he
be
the
late
Mr
Wakley
)
,
cast
a
look
of
strong
encouragement
in
my
direction
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
we
have
the
doctor
who
have
make
the
examination
,
and
the
usual
test
as
to
whether
the
child
be
bear
alive
;
but
he
be
a
timid
,
muddle
-
headed
doctor
,
and
get
confused
and
contradictory
,
and
would
not
say
this
,
and
could
not
answer
for
that
,
and
the
immaculate
broker
be
too
much
for
him
,
and
our
side
slide
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
try
again
,
and
the
Coroner
back
me
again
,
for
which
I
ever
afterwards
feel
grateful
to
him
as
I
do
now
to
his
memory
;
and
we
get
another
favourable
turn
,
out
of
some
other
witness
,
some
member
of
the
family
with
a
strong
prepossession
against
the
sinner
;
and
I
think
we
have
the
doctor
back
again
;
and
I
know
that
the
Coroner
sum
up
for
our
side
,
and
that
I
and
my
british
brother
turn
round
to
discuss
our
verdict
,
and
get
ourselves
into
great
difficulty
with
our
large
chair
and
the
broker
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
stage
of
the
case
I
try
hard
again
,
be
convince
that
I
have
cause
for
it
;
and
at
last
we
find
for
the
minor
offence
of
only
conceal
the
birth
;
and
the
poor
desolate
creature
,
who
have
be
take
out
during
our
deliberation
,
be
bring
in
again
to
be
tell
of
the
verdict
,
then
drop
upon
her
knee
before
us
,
with
protestation
that
we
be
right
---
protestation
among
the
most
affecting
that
I
have
ever
hear
in
my
life
---
and
be
carry
away
insensible
.
   
<EOS>
(
in
private
conversation
after
this
be
all
over
,
the
Coroner
show
me
his
reason
as
a
train
surgeon
,
for
perceive
it
to
be
impossible
that
the
child
could
,
under
the
most
favourable
circumstance
,
have
draw
many
breath
,
in
the
very
doubtful
case
of
its
have
ever
breathe
at
all
;
this
,
owe
to
the
discovery
of
some
foreign
matter
in
the
windpipe
,
quite
irreconcilable
with
many
moment
of
life
.
)
   
<EOS>
when
the
agonise
girl
have
make
those
final
protestation
,
I
have
see
her
face
,
and
it
be
in
unison
with
her
distracted
heartbroken
voice
,
and
it
be
very
moving
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
do
not
impress
me
by
any
beauty
that
it
have
,
and
if
I
ever
see
it
again
in
another
world
<EOS>
I
shall
only
know
it
by
the
help
of
some
new
sense
or
intelligence
.
<EOS>
but
it
come
to
me
in
my
sleep
that
night
,
and
I
selfishly
dismiss
it
in
the
most
efficient
way
I
could
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
cause
some
extra
care
to
be
take
of
her
in
the
prison
,
and
counsel
to
be
retain
for
her
defence
when
she
be
try
at
the
Old
Bailey
;
and
her
sentence
be
lenient
,
and
her
history
and
conduct
prove
that
it
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
in
do
the
little
I
do
for
her
,
I
remember
to
have
have
the
kind
help
of
some
gentle
-
hearted
functionary
to
whom
I
address
myself
---
but
what
functionary
I
have
long
forget
---
who
I
suppose
be
officially
present
at
the
Inquest
.
   
<EOS>
I
regard
this
as
a
very
notable
uncommercial
experience
,
because
this
good
come
of
a
Beadle
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
the
good
of
my
knowledge
,
information
,
and
belief
,
it
be
the
only
good
that
ever
do
come
of
a
Beadle
since
the
first
Beadle
put
on
his
cock
-
hat
.
    
<EOS>
Number
19
:
<EOS>
birthday
celebration
 
<EOS>
It
come
into
my
mind
that
I
would
recall
in
these
note
a
few
of
the
many
hostelry
I
have
rest
at
in
the
course
of
my
journey
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
have
take
up
my
pen
for
the
purpose
,
when
I
be
baffle
by
an
accidental
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
have
to
leave
off
,
to
wish
the
owner
of
a
certain
bright
face
that
look
in
at
my
door
,
"
many
happy
return
of
the
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
thereupon
a
new
thought
come
into
my
mind
,
drive
its
predecessor
out
,
and
I
begin
to
recall
---
instead
of
Inns
---
the
birthday
that
I
have
put
up
at
,
on
my
way
to
this
present
sheet
of
paper
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
very
well
remember
be
take
out
to
visit
some
peach
-
face
creature
in
a
blue
sash
,
and
shoe
to
correspond
,
whose
life
I
suppose
to
consist
entirely
of
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
upon
seed
-
cake
,
sweet
wine
,
and
shine
present
,
that
glorify
young
person
seem
to
me
to
be
exclusively
rear
.
 
<EOS>
at
so
early
a
stage
of
my
travel
do
I
assist
at
the
anniversary
of
her
nativity
(
and
become
enamour
of
her
)
,
that
I
have
not
yet
acquire
the
recondite
knowledge
that
a
birthday
be
the
common
property
of
all
who
be
bear
,
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
special
gift
bestow
by
the
favour
Heavens
on
that
one
distinguished
infant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
company
,
and
we
sit
in
a
shady
bower
---
under
a

a

me
next
morning

I
be
wretched

<EOS>
on
the
whole

a
pretty
accurate
foreshadowing
of
my
more
mature
experience
in
such
wise

<EOS>
then
come
the
time
when
,
inseparable
from
one
's
own
birthday
,
be
a
certain
sense
of
merit
,
a
consciousness
of
well

earn
distinction

<EOS>
when
I
regard
my
birthday
as
a
graceful
achievement
of
my
own
,
a
monument
of
my
perseverance
,
independence
,
and
good
sense

redound
greatly
to
my
honour

<EOS>
this
be
at
about
the
period
when
Olympia
Squires
become
involved
in
the
anniversary

<EOS>
Olympia
be
most
beautiful
(
of
course
)
,
and
I
love
her
to
that
degree
,
that
I
use
to
be
oblige
to
get
out
of
my
little
bed
in
the
night
,
expressly
to
exclaim
to
Solitude
,
"
o

Olympia
Squires
!
"
 
<EOS>
vision
of
Olympia
,
clothe
entirely
in
sage
-
green
,
from
which
I
infer
a
defectively
educate
taste
on
the
part
of
her
respected
parent
,
who
be
necessarily
unacquainted
with
the
South
Kensington
Museum
,
still
arise
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
Truth
be
sacred
,
and
the
vision
be
crown
by
a
shine
white
beaver
bonnet
,
impossibly
suggestive
of
a
little
feminine
postboy
.
 
<EOS>
My
memory
present
a
birthday
when
Olympia
and
I
be
take
by
an
unfeeling
relative
---
some
cruel
uncle
,
or
the
like
---
to
a
slow
torture
call
an
Orrery
.
 
<EOS>
the
terrible
instrument
be
set
up
at
the
local
Theatre
,
and
I
have
express
a
profane
wish
in
the
morning
that
it
be
a
play
:
 
for
which
a
serious
aunt
have
probe
my
conscience
deep
,
and
my
pocket
deeper
,
by
reclaim
a
bestow
half
-
crown
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
venerable
and
a
shabby
Orrery
,
at
least
one
thousand
star
and
twenty
-
five
comet
behind
the
age
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
awful
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
low
-
spirited
gentleman
with
a
wand
say
,
"
lady
and
gentleman
"
(
mean
particularly
Olympia
and
me
)
,
"
the
light
be
about
to
be
put
out
,
but
there
be
not
the
slight
cause
for
alarm
,
"
it
be
very
alarming
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
planet
and
star
begin
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
would
not
come
on
,
sometimes
they
would
not
go
off
,
sometimes
they
have
hole
in
them
,
and
mostly
they
do
not
seem
to
be
good
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
gentleman
with
the
wand
be
go
on
in
the
dark
(
tap
away
at
the
heavenly
body
between
while
,
like
a
wearisome
woodpecker
)
,
about
a
sphere
revolve
on
its
own
axis
eight
hundred
and
ninety
-
seven
thousand
million
of
time
---
or
mile
---
in
two
hundred
and
sixty
-
three
thousand
five
hundred
and
twenty
-
four
million
of
something
else
,
until
I
think
if
this
be
a
birthday
it
be
well
never
to
have
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
Olympia
,
also
,
become
much
depressed
,
and
we
both
slumber
and
wake
cross
,
and
still
the
gentleman
be
go
on
in
the
dark
---
whether
up
in
the
star
,
or
down
on
the
stage
,
it
would
have
be
hard
to
make
out
,
if
it
have
be
worth
try

cypher
away
about
plane
of
orbit

to
such
an
infamous
extent
that
Olympia

sting
to
madness

actually
kick
me

<EOS>
a
pretty
birthday
spectacle
,
when
the
light
be
turn
up
again

and
all
the
school
in
the
town
(
include
the
National
,
who
have
come

discover
with
exhausted
countenance

screw
their
knuckle

<EOS>
a
pretty
birthday
speech
when
Dr.
Sleek
of
the
City

Free
bob
up
his
powdered
head
in
the
stage

box
,
and
say
that
before

he
really
must
beg
to
express
his
entire
approval
of
a
lecture
as
improve

as
inform

as
devoid
of
anything
that
could
call
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
youth
,
as
any
it
have
ever
be
his
lot
to
hear
deliver
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
birthday
altogether
,
when
Astronomy
could
not
leave
poor
Small
Olympia
Squires
and
me
alone
,
but
must
put
an
end
to
our
love
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
we
never
get
over
it
;
<EOS>
the
threadbare
Orrery
outwore
our
mutual
tenderness
;
the
man
with
the
wand
be
too
much
for
the
boy
with
the
bow

<EOS>
when
shall
I
disconnect
the
combined
smell
of
orange
,
brown
paper
,
and
straw
,
from
those
other
birthday
at
school
,
when
the
come
hamper
cast
its
shadow
before
,
and
when
a
week
of
social
harmony

shall
I
add
of
admire
and
affectionate
popularity

lead
up
to
that
institution

<EOS>
what
noble
sentiment
be
express
to
me
in

day
before
the

what
vow

<EOS>
the
birthday
of
the
pot
game
and
guava
jelly
,
be
still
make
special
to
me
by
the
noble
conduct
of
Bully
Globson
.
 
<EOS>
letter
from
home
have
mysteriously
inquire
whether
I
should
be
much
surprised
and
disappoint
if
among
the
treasure
in
the
come
hamper
I
discover
potted
game
,
and
guava
jelly
from
the
Western
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
mention
those
hint
in
confidence
to
a
few
friend
,
and
have
promise
to
give
away
,
as
I
now
see
reason
to
believe
,
a
handsome
covey
of
partridge
pot
,
and
about
a
hundredweight
of
guava
jelly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
that
Globson
,
Bully
no
more
,
seek
me
out
in
the
playground
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
big
fat
boy
,
with
a
big
fat
head
and
a
big
fat
fist
,
and
at
the
beginning
of
that
half
have
raise
such
a
bump
on
my
forehead
that
I
could
not
get
my
hat
of
state
on
,
to
go
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
after
an
interval
of
cool
reflection
(
four
month
)
he
now
feel
this
blow
to
have
be
an
error
of
judgment
,
and
that
he
wish
to
apologise
for
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
that
,
but
hold
down
his
big
head
between
his
two
big
hand
in
order
that
I
may
reach
it
conveniently
,
he
request
me
,
as
an
act
of
justice
which
would
appease
his
awakened
conscience
,
to
raise
a
retributive
bump
upon
it
,
in
the
presence
of
witness
.
 
<EOS>
this
handsome
proposal
I
modestly
decline
,
and
he
then
embrace
me
,
and
we
walk
away
converse
.
 
<EOS>
We
converse
respect
the
West
India
Islands
,
and
,
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
he
ask
me
with
much
interest
whether
in
the
course
of
my
reading
I
have
meet
with
any
reliable
description
of
the
mode
of
manufacture
guava
jelly
;
or
whether
I
have
ever
happen
to
taste
that
conserve
,
which
he
have
be
give
to
understand
be
of
rare
excellence
.
   
<EOS>
seventeen
,
eighteen
,
nineteen
,
twenty

and
then
with
the
waning
month
come
an
ever
augment
sense
of
the
dignity
of
twenty

one
.
<EOS>
Heaven
know
I
have
nothing
to
"
come
into
,
"
save
the
bare
birthday
,
and
yet
I
esteem
it
as
a
great
possession
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
and
then
pave
the
way
to
my
state
of
dignity
,
by
begin
a
proposition
with
the
casual
word
,
"
say
that
a
man
of
twenty

one
,
"
or
by
the
incidental
assumption
of
a
fact
that
could
not
sanely
be
dispute
,
as
,
"
for
when
a
fellow
come
to
be
a
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
give
a
party
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
name
Her
,
more
particularly
;
She
be
old
than
I
,
and
have
pervade
every
chink
and
crevice
of
my
mind
for
three
or
four
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hold
volume
of
Imaginary
Conversations
with
her
mother
on
the
subject
of
our
union

I
have
write
letter
more
in
number
than
Horace
Walpole

to
that
discreet
woman
,
solicit
her
daughter
's
hand
in
marriage

<EOS>
I
have
never
have
the
remote
intention
of
send
any
of
those
letter
;
but
to
write
them
,
and
after
a
few
day
tear
them
up
,
have
be
a
sublime
occupation

<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
have
begin
"

I

that

I

endow
with
those
womanly

it

more

can
scarcely
have
fail

discover
that
I
love
your
adorable

deeply
,
devotedly

"
 
<EOS>
in
less
buoyant

of

<EOS>
I
have
begin
,
"

with

<EOS>
at

in

perceive
that
the

would
have
most
completely

I
try

not

I
vacillate

bleak

wind
up

"
Farewell

<EOS>
this
fictitious

mine
be
to
blame

I
be
about

pursue
the
statement

on
my
twenty

first
birthday
I
give
a
party

She
be
there

<EOS>
It
be

there

everything

It

in

I
raise

look

track
the
circle

I

after
all

bitter
powder

the
wretchedness
again

anybody

if
I

I
should
know

the
first
Magic
Lantern
I
ever

be
secretly

elaborately
plan

be
the
great
effect

very
juvenile
birthday

it
would
not
act

its

My
experience
of
adult
birthday
Magic
Lanterns
may
possibly
have
be
unfortunate

have
certainly
be
similar

<EOS>
I
have
an
illustrative
birthday
in
my
eye
:
 
a
birthday
of
my
friend
Flipfield

whose
birthday
have
long
be
remarkable
as
social
success

<EOS>
there
have
be
nothing
set

formal
about

Flipfield
have
be
accustom

to
say

two

three
day
before
,
"
do
not

to
come
and
dine
,
old
boy

accord
to
custom

I
do
not
know
what
he
say
to
the
lady
he
invite

I
may
safely
assume
it
not

have
be
"
old

those
be
delightful
gathering

<EOS>
in
an
evil
hour

a
long

lose
brother
of
Flipfield

come
to

in
foreign
part

<EOS>
where
he
have
be
hide

or
what
he
have

I
do

Flipfield
vaguely
inform
me
that
he

turn
up
"
on

that
matter

contrived

that

should
appear
in
the
nick
of

on
his
(
Flipfield

birthday
.
 
<EOS>
Delicacy
command
that
I
should
repress
the
gloomy
anticipation
with
which
my

become
fraught
when
I
hear
of

<EOS>
the
fatal
day
arrive
,
and
we
assemble
in
force
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Flipfield
senior
form
an
interesting
feature
in
the
group
,
with
a
blue
-
veined
miniature
of
the
late
Mr
Flipfield
round
her
neck
,
in
an
oval
,
resemble
a
tart
from
the
pastrycook

:
 
his
hair
powder
,
and
the
bright
button
on
his
coat
,
evidently
very
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
accompany
by
Miss
Flipfield
,
the
eld
of
her
numerous
family
,
who
hold
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
her
bosom
in
a
majestic
manner
,
and
speak
to
all
of
us
<EOS>
(
none
of
us
have
ever
see
her
before
)
,
in
pious
and
condone
tone
,
of
all
the
quarrel
that
have
take
place
in
the
family
,
from
her
infancy
---
which
must
have
be
a
long
time
ago
---
down
to
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
Long

do
not
appear
.
 
<EOS>
dinner
,
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
,
be
announce
,
and
still
no
long
-
lose
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
down
to
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
knife
and
fork
of
the
long
-
lose
make
a
vacuum
in
Nature
,
and
when
the
champagne
come
round
for
the
first
time
,
Flipfield
give
him
up
for
the
day
,
and
have
them
remove
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
the
long
-
lose
gain
the
height
of
his
popularity
with
the
company
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
feel
convinced
that
I
love
him
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
Flipfield
's
dinner
be
perfect
,
and
he
be
the
easy
and
good
of
entertainer
.
 
<EOS>
Dinner
go
on
brilliantly
,
and
the
more
the
long
-
lose
do
not
come
,
the
more
comfortable
we
grow
,
and
the
more
highly
we
think
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Flipfield
's
own
man
(
who
have
a
regard
for
me
)
be
in
the
act
of
struggle
with
an
ignorant
stipendiary
,
to
wrest
from
him
the
wooden
leg
of
a
Guinea
-
fowl
which
he
be
press
on
my
acceptance
,
and
to
substitute
a
slice
of
the
breast
,
when
a
ringing
at
the
door
-
bell
suspend
the
strife
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
round
me
,
and
perceive
the
sudden
pallor
which
I
know
my
own
visage
reveal
,
reflect
in
the
face
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Flipfield
hurriedly
excuse
himself
,
go
out
,
be
absent
for
about
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
re
-
enter
with
the
long
-
lose
.
   
<EOS>
I
beg
to
say
distinctly
that
if
the
stranger
have
bring
Mont
Blanc
with
him
,
or
have
come
attend
by
a
retinue
of
eternal
snow
,
he
could
not
have
chill
the
circle
to
the
marrow
in
a
more
efficient
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Embodied
Failure
sit
enthrone
upon
the
Long
-
lost
's
brow
,
and
pervade
him
to
his
long
-
lose
boot
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
Mrs
Flipfield
senior
,
open
her
arm
,
exclaim
,
"
My
Tom
!
"
and
press
his
nose
against
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
his
other
parent
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
Miss
Flipfield
,
in
the
first
transport
of
this
re
-
union
,
show
him
a
dint
upon
her
maidenly
cheek
,
and
ask
him
if
he
remember
when
he
do
that
with
the
bellow
?
 
<EOS>
We
,
the
bystander
,
be
overcome
,
but
overcome
by
the
palpable
,
undisguisable
,
utter
,
and
total
break
-
down
of
the
long
-
lose
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
he
could
have
do
would
have
set
him
right
with
us
but
his
instant
return
to
the
Ganges
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
same
moment
it
become
establish
that
the
feeling
be
reciprocal
,
and
that
the
long
-
lose
detest
us
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
friend
of
the
family
(
not
myself
,
upon
my
honour
)
,
wish
to
set
thing
go
again
,
ask
him
,
while
he
partake
of
soup
---
ask
him
with
an
amiability
of
intention
beyond
all
praise
,
but
with
a
weakness
of
execution
open
to
defeat
---
what
kind
of
river
he
consider
the
Ganges
,
the
long
-
lose
,
scowl
at
the
friend
of
the
family
over
his
spoon
,
as
one
of
an
abhorrent
race
,
reply
,
"
why
,
a
river
of
water
,
I
suppose
,
"
and
spoon
his
soup
into
himself
with
a
malignancy
of
hand
and
eye
that
blight
the
amiable
questioner
.
 
<EOS>
not
an
opinion
could
be
elicit
from
the
long
-
lose
,
in
unison
with
the
sentiment
of
any
individual
present
.
 
<EOS>
He
contradict
Flipfield
dead
,
before
he
have
eat
his
salmon
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
---
or
affect
to
have
no
idea
---
that
it
be
his
brother
's
birthday
,
and
on
the
communication
of
that
interesting
fact
to
him
,
merely
want
to
make
him
out
four
year
old
than
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
antipathetical
being
,
with
a
peculiar
power
and
gift
of
tread
on
everybody
's
tender
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
in
America
of
a
man
's
"
Platform
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
should
describe
the
Platform
of
the
long
-
lose
as
a
platform
compose
of
other
people
's
corn
,
on
which
he
have
stump
his
way
,
with
all
his
might
and
main
,
to
his
present
position
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
add
that
Flipfield
's
great
birthday
go
by
the
board
,
and
that
he
be
a
wreck
when
I
pretend
at
part
to
wish
him
many
happy
return
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
class
of
birthday
at
which
I
have
so
frequently
assist
,
that
I
may
assume
such
birthday
to
be
pretty
well
known
to
the
human
race
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Mayday
's
birthday
be
an
example
.
 
<EOS>
the
guest
have
no
knowledge
of
one
another
except
on
that
one
day
in
the
year
,
and
be
annually
terrified
for
a
week
by
the
prospect
of
meet
one
another
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fiction
among
us
that
we
have
uncommon
reason
for
be
particularly
lively
and
spirit
on
the
occasion
,
whereas
deep
despondency
be
no
phrase
for
the
expression
of
our
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
wonderful
feature
of
the
case
be
,
that
we
be
in
tacit
accordance
to
avoid
the
subject
---
to
keep
it
as
far
off
as
possible
,
as
long
as
possible
---
and
to
talk
about
anything
else
,
rather
than
the
joyful
event
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
even
go
so
far
as
to
assert
that
there
be
a
dumb
compact
among
us
that
we
will
pretend
that
it
be
not
Mayday
's
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
a
mysterious
and
gloomy
Being
,
who
be
say
to
have
go
to
school
with
Mayday
,
and
who
be
so
lank
and
lean
that
he
seriously
impugn
the
Dietary
of
the
establishment
at
which
they
be
jointly
educate
,
always
lead
us
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
the
block
,
by
lay
his
grisly
hand
on
a
decanter
and
beg
us
to
fill
our
glass
.
 
<EOS>
the
device
and
pretence
that
I
have
see
put
in
practice
to
defer
the
fatal
moment
,
and
to
interpose
between
this
man
and
his
purpose
,
be
innumerable
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
desperate
guest
,
when
they
see
the
grisly
hand
approach
the
decanter
,
wildly
to
begin
,
without
any
antecedent
whatsoever
<EOS>
,
"
that
remind
me
---
"
and
to
plunge
into
long
story
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
the
hand
and
the
decanter
come
together
,
a
shudder
,
a
palpable
perceptible
shudder
,
go
round
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
We
receive
the
reminder
that
it
be
Mayday
's
birthday
,
as
if
it
be
the
anniversary
of
some
profound
disgrace
he
have
undergo
,
and
we
seek
to
comfort
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
have
drunk
Mayday
's
health
,
and
wish
him
many
happy
return
,
we
be
seize
for
some
moment
with
a
ghastly
blitheness
,
an
unnatural
levity
,
as
if
we
be
in
the
first
flushed
reaction
of
have
undergo
a
surgical
operation
.
   
<EOS>
birthday
of
this
specie
have
a
public
as
well
as
a
private
phase
.
<EOS>
My
"
boyhood
's
home
,
"
Dullborough
,
present
a
case
in
point
.
 
<EOS>
an
Immortal
Somebody
be
want
in
Dullborough
,
to
dimple
for
a
day
the
stagnant
face
of
the
water
;
he
be
rather
want
by
Dullborough
generally
,
and
much
want
by
the
principal
hotel
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
the
County
history
be
look
up
for
a
locally
Immortal
Somebody
,
but
the
register
Dullborough
worthy
be
all
Nobodies
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
thing
,
it
be
hardly
necessary
to
record
that
Dullborough
do
what
every
man
do
when
he
want
to
write
a
book
or
deliver
a
lecture
,
and
be
provide
with
all
the
material
except
a
subject
.
 
<EOS>
It
fall
back
upon
Shakespeare
.
   
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
it
resolve
to
celebrate
Shakespeare
's
birthday
in
Dullborough
,
than
the
popularity
of
the
immortal
bard
become
surprising
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
suppose
the
first
edition
of
his
work
to
have
be
publish
last
week
,
and
enthusiastic
Dullborough
to
have
get
half
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
(
I
doubt
,
by
the
way
,
whether
it
have
ever
do
half
that
,
but
that
be
a
private
opinion

a

retention
of
which
for
two

enfeeble
his

portrait
of

break
out
in

,
and
our
principal
artist
paint
a
large
original
portrait
in
oil
for
the
decoration
of
the
dining

<EOS>
It
be
not
in
the

like
any
of
the
other

be
exceedingly

the

<EOS>
at
the

the
Debating
Society
discuss
the

be
there
sufficient
ground
for
supposing
that
the
Immortal
Shakespeare
ever
steal
deer
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
indignantly
decide
by
an
overwhelming
majority
in
the
negative
;
indeed
,
there
be
but
one
vote
on
the
poaching
side
,
and
that
be
the
vote
of
the
orator
who
have
undertake
to
advocate
it
,
and
who
become
quite
an
obnoxious
character
---
particularly
to
the
Dullborough
"
rough

who
be
about
as
well
inform
on
the

as
most
other
people

nearly

not

<EOS>

it
would
have
be
far
from

measure
in
the
height
of
the
excitement

to
have
tell
Dullborough
that

,
after
all
these
preparation

when
the

festivity
take

the

elevate
aloft
,
survey
the

as

a

itself
up

it

undoubtedly

the
inscrutable
mystery

that
nobody

be
induce

not
to

to

but
to
come
within

mile
of
him
,
until
the
crack
speaker
of
Dullborough
rise
to
propose
the
immortal
memory
.
 
<EOS>
which
he
do
with
the
perplexing
and
astonishing
result
that
before

half

far

I

,
in

can
behold
a

within

at
school
,
one
of
seventy
boy
,
I
wonder
by
what
secret
understand
our
attention
begin
to
wander
when
we
have
pore
over
our
book
for
some
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
by
what
ingenuity
we
bring
on
that
confused
state
of
mind
when
sense
become
nonsense
,
when
figure
would
not
work
,
when
dead
language
would
not
construe
,
when
live
language
would
not
be
speak
,
when
memory
would
not
come
,
when
dulness
and
vacancy
would
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
that
we
ever
conspire
to
be
sleepy
after
dinner
,
or
that
we
ever
particularly
want
to
be
stupid
,
and
to
have
flush
face
and
hot
beating
head
,
or
to
find
blank
hopelessness
and
obscurity
this
afternoon
in
what
would
become
perfectly
clear
and
bright
in
the
freshness
of
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
suffer
for
these
thing
,
and
they
make
us
miserable
enough
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
do
I
remember
that
we
ever
bind
ourselves
by
any
secret
oath
or
other
solemn
obligation
,
to
find
the
seat
get
too
hard
to
be
sit
upon
after
a
certain
time
;
or
to
have
intolerable
twitch
in
our
leg
,
render
us
aggressive
and
malicious
with
those
member
;
or
to
be
trouble
with
a
similar
uneasiness
in
our
elbow
,
attend
with
fistic
consequence
to
our
neighbour
;
or
to
carry
two
pound
of
lead
in
the
chest
,
four
pound
in
the
head
,
and
several
active
blue
-
bottle
in
each
ear
.
<EOS>
yet
,
for
certain
,
we
suffer
under
those
distress
,
and
be
always
charge
at
for
labour
under
them
,
as
if
we
have
bring
them
on
,
of
our
own
deliberate
act
and
deed
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
mental
portion
of
them
be
my
own
fault
in
my
own
case
<EOS>
---
I
should
like
to
ask
any
well
-
train
and
experience
teacher
,
not
to
say
psychologist
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
physical
portion
---
I
should
like
to
ask
PROFESSOR
OWEN
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
happen
that
I
have
a
small
bundle
of
paper
with
me
,
on
what
be
call
"
the
Half
-
time
System
"
in
school
.
 
<EOS>
refer
to
one
of
those
paper
<EOS>
I
find
that
the
indefatigable
MR
.
<EOS>
CHADWICK
have
be
beforehand
with
me
,
and
have
already
ask
Professor
Owen
:
 
who
have
handsomely
reply
that
I
be
not
to
blame
,
but
that
,
be
trouble
with
a
skeleton
,
and
have
be
constitute
accord
to
certain
natural
law
,
I
and
my
skeleton
be
unfortunately
bind
by
those
law
even
in
school
---
and
have
comport
ourselves
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
much
comfort
by
the
good
Professor
's
be
on
my
side
,
I
read
on
to
discover
whether
the
indefatigable
Mr
Chadwick
have
take
up
the
mental
part
of
my
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
he
have
,
and
that
he
have
gain
on
my
behalf
,
SIR
BENJAMIN
BRODIE
,
SIR
DAVID
WILKIE
,
SIR
WALTER
SCOTT
,
and
the
common
sense
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
for
which
I
beg
Mr
Chadwick
,
if
this
should
meet
his
eye
,
to
accept
my
warm
acknowledgment
.
   
<EOS>
up
to
that
time
I
have
retain
a
misgiving
that
the
seventy
unfortunate
of
whom
I
be
one
,
must
have
be
,
without
know
it
,
league
together
by
the
spirit
of
evil
in
a
sort
of
perpetual
Guy
Fawkes
Plot
,
to
grope
about
in
vault
with
dark
lantern
after
a
certain
period
of
continuous
study
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
the
misgive
vanish
,
and
I
float
on
with
a
quieted
mind
to
see
the
Half
-
time
System
in
action
.
 
<EOS>
for
that
be
the
purpose
of
my
journey
,
both
by
steamboat
on
the
Thames
,
and
by
very
dirty
railway
on
the
shore
.
<EOS>
to
which
last
institution
,
I
beg
to
recommend
the
legal
use
of
coke
as
engine
-
fuel
,
rather
than
the
illegal
use
of
coal
;
the
recommendation
be
quite
disintereste
,
for
I
be
most
liberally
supply
with
small
coal
on
the
journey
,
for
which
no
charge
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
only
my
eye
,
nose
,
and
ear
fill
,
but
my
hat
,
and
all
my
pocket
,
and
my
pocket
-
book
,
and
my
watch
.
   
<EOS>
the
V*D*S*C*R*C
<EOS>
(
or
very
dirty
and
Small
Coal
Railway
Company
)
deliver
me
close
to
my
destination
,
and
I
soon
find
the
Half
-
Time
System
establish
in
spacious
premise
,
and
freely
place
at
my
convenience
and
disposal
.
   
<EOS>
what
would
I
see
first
of
the
Half
-
time
System
?
 
<EOS>
I
choose
Military
Drill
.
 
<EOS>
"
atten

"
 
<EOS>
instantly
a
hundred
boy
stand
forth
in
the
paved
yard
as
one
boy
;
bright
,
quick
,
eager
,
steady
,
watchful
for
the
look
of
command
,
instant
and
ready
for
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
be
there
complete
precision
---
complete
accord
to
the
eye
and
to
the
ear
---
but
an
alertness
in
the
doing
of
the
thing
which
deprive
it
,
curiously
,
of
its
monotonous
or
mechanical
character
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
perfect
uniformity
,
and
yet
an
individual
spirit
and
emulation
.
 
<EOS>
no
spectator
could
doubt
that
the
boy
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
with
non
-
commission
officer
vary
from
a
yard
to
a
yard
and
a
half
high
,
the
result
could
not
possibly
have
be
attain
otherwise
.
<EOS>
They
march
,
and
counter
-
marched
,
and
form
in
line
and
square
,
and
company
,
and
single
file
and
double
file
,
and
perform
a
variety
of
evolution
;
all
most
admirably
.
 
<EOS>
in
respect
of
an
air
of
enjoyable
understanding
of
what
they
be
about
,
which
seem
to
be
forbid
to
english
soldier
,
the
boy
may
have
be
small

.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be

and
the
broadsword

,
limit
to
a
much
small
number
,
succeed
,
the
boy
who
have
no
part
in
that
new
drill
,
either
look
on
attentively
,
or
disport
themselves
in
a
gymnasium
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
the
steadiness
of
the
broadsword
boy
on
their
short
leg
,
and
the
firmness
with
which
they
sustain
the
different
position
,
be
truly
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
the
broadsword
exercise
over
,
suddenly
there
be
great
excitement
and
a
rush
.
 
<EOS>
Naval
Drill
!
   
<EOS>
in
the
corner
of
the
ground
stand
a
decked
mimic
ship
,
with
real
mast
,
yard
,
and
sail
---
mainmast
seventy
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
word
of
command
from
the
Skipper
of
this
ship
---
a
mahogany

face
Old
Salt
,
with
the
indispensable
quid
in
his
cheek
,
the
true
nautical
roll
,
and
all
wonderfully
complete
---
the
rigging
be
cover
with
a
swarm
of
boy
:
 
one
,
the
first
to
spring
into
the
shroud
,
outstrip
all
the
other
,
and
rest
on
the
truck
of
the
main
-
topmast
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
we
stand
out
to
sea
,
in
a
most
amazing
manner
;
the
Skipper
himself
,
the
whole
crew
,
the
Uncommercial
,
and
all
hand
present
,
implicitly
believe
that
there
be
not
a
moment
to
lose
,
that
the
wind
have
that
instant
chop
round
and
spring
up
fair

that
we
be
away

<EOS>
my

<EOS>
well

<EOS>
there
you

<EOS>
pretty

<EOS>
every

upon

she

carry

,
and
ship
cut
through
the
water
fifteen
knot
an
hour
!
   
<EOS>
at
this
favourable
moment
of
her
voyage
,
I
give
the
alarm
"
a
man
overboard
!
"
<EOS>
(
on
the
gravel
)
,
but
he
be
immediately
recover
,
none
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
I
observe
the
Skipper
overboard
,
but
forbore
to
mention
it
,
as
he
seem
in
no
wise
disconcert
by
the
accident
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
soon
come
to
regard
the
Skipper
as
an
amphibious
creature
,
for
he
be
so
perpetually
plunge
overboard
to
look
up
at
the
hand
aloft
,
that
he
be
oftener
in
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
than
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
His
pride
in
his
crew
on
those
occasion
be
delightful
,
and
the
conventional
unintelligibility
of
his
order
in
the
ear
of
uncommercial
landlubber
and
loblolly
boy
,
though
they
be
always
intelligible
to
the
crew
,
be
hardly
less
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
could
not
expect
to
go
on
in
this
way
for
ever
;
dirty
weather
come
on
,
and
then
bad
weather
,
and
when
we
least
expect
it
we
get
into
tremendous
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
Screw
loose
in
the
chart
perhaps
<EOS>
---
something
certainly
wrong
somewhere
---
<EOS>
but
here
we
be
with
breaker
ahead
,
my
lad
,
drive
head
on
,
slap
on
a
lee
shore
!
 
<EOS>
the
Skipper
broach
this
terrific
announcement
in
such
great
agitation
,
that
the
small
fifer
,
not
fifee
now
,
but
stand
look
on
near
the
wheel
with
his
fife
under
his
arm
,
seem
for
the
moment
quite
unboyed
,
though
he
speedily
recover
his
presence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
try
circumstance
that
ensue
,
the
Skipper
and
the
crew
prove
worthy
of
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
Skipper
get
dreadfully
hoarse
,
but
otherwise
be
master
of
the
situation
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
at
the
wheel
do
wonder
;
all
hand
(
except
the
fifer
)
be
turn
up
to
wear
ship
;
and
I
observe
the
fifer
,
when
we
be
at
our
great
extremity
,
to
refer
to
some
document
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
which
I
conceive
to
be
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
strike
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
myself
conscious
of
any
collision
,
but
I
see
the
Skipper
so
very
often
wash
overboard
and
back
again
,
that
I
could
only
impute
it
to
the
beating
of
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
enough
of
a
seaman
to
describe
the
manoeuvre
by
which
we
be
save
,
but
they
make
the
Skipper
very
hot
<EOS>
(
french
polish
his
mahogany
face
)
and
the
crew
very
nimble
,
and
succeed
to
a
marvel
;
for
,
within
a
few
minute
of
the
first
alarm
,
we
have
wear
ship
and
get
her
off
,
and
be
all
a
-
tauto
---
which
I
feel
very
grateful
for
:
 
not
that
I
know
what
it
be
,
but
that
I
perceive
that
we
have
not
be
all
a
-
tauto
lately
.
 
<EOS>
Land
now
appear
on
our
weather
-
bow
,
and
we
shape
our
course
for
it
,
have
the
wind
abeam
,
and
frequently
change
the
man
at
the
helm
,
in
order
that
every
man
may
have
his
spell
.
 
<EOS>
We
work
into
harbour
under
prosperous
circumstance
,
and
furl
our
sail
,
and
square
our
yard
,
and
make
all
ship
-
shape
and
handsome
,
and
so
our
voyage
end
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
compliment
the
Skipper
at
part
on
his
exertion
and
those
of
his
gallant
crew
,
he
inform
me
that
the
latter
be
provide
for
the
bad
,
all
hand
be
teach
to
swim
and
dive
;
and
he
add
that
the
able
seaman
at
the
main
-
topmast
truck
especially
,
could
dive
as
deep
as
he
could
go
high
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
adventure
that
befall
me
in
my
visit
to
the
Short
-
Timers
,
be
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
military
band
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
inspect
the
hammock
of
the
crew
of
the
good
ship
,
when
I
see
with
astonishment
that
several
musical
instrument
,
brazen
and
of
great
size
,
appear
to
have
suddenly
develop
two
leg
each
,
and
to
be
trot
about
a
yard
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
astonishment
be
heighten
when
I
observe
a
large
drum
,
that
have
previously
be
lean
helpless
against
a
wall
,
take
up
a
stout
position
on
four
leg
.
<EOS>
approach
this
drum
and
look
over
it
,
I
find
two
boy
behind
it
(
it
be
too
much
for
one
)
,
and
then
I
find
that
each
of
the
brazen
instrument
have
bring
out
a
boy
,
and
be
go
to
discourse
sweet
sound
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
---
not
omit
the
fifer
,
now
play
a
new
instrument
---
be
dress
in
neat
uniform
,
and
stand
up
in
a
circle
at
their
music
-
stand
,
like
any
other
Military
Band
.
<EOS>
They
play
a
march
or
two
,
and
then
we
have
Cheer
boy
,
Cheer
,
and
then
we
have
Yankee
Doodle
,
and
we
finish
,
as
in
loyal
duty
bind
,
with
God
save
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
the
band
's
proficiency
be
perfectly
wonderful
,
and
it
be
not
at
all
wonderful
that
the
whole
body
corporate
of
Short
-
Timers
listen
with
face
of
the
lively
interest
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
what
happen
next
among
the
Short
-
Timers
?
 
<EOS>
as
if
the
band
have
blow
me
into
a
great
class
-
room
out
of
their
brazen
tube
,
in
a
great
class
-
room
I
find
myself
now
,
with
the
whole
choral
force
of
Short
-
Timers
singe
the
praise
of
a
summer
's
day
to
the
harmonium
,
and
my
small
but
highly
respected
friend
the
fifer
blaze
away
vocally
,
as
if
he
have
be
save
up
his
wind
for
the
last
twelvemonth
;
also
the
whole
crew
of
the
good
ship
nameless
swarm
up
and
down
the
scale
as
if
they
have
never
swarm
up
and
down
the
rigging
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
,
we
throw
our
whole
power
into
God
bless
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
bless
his
Royal
Highness
to
such
an
extent
that
,
for
my
own
uncommercial
part
,
I
gasp
again
when
it
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
this
be
do
,
we
form
,
with
surpass

the

since
the

it

be
prove
here
that
eighteen

that

<EOS>
the

prove

<EOS>
obviously
another
of
the
immense
advantage
of
the

to
the

be
the

diminution

of

over

it
extend

<EOS>
the
last
be
a

important
consideration

as
poor

<EOS>
It
will
be
object
:
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
that
this
be

special

be
necessary
to
such
success

secondly
,
that
this
be

very
well

must
be
very

<EOS>
thirdly

that
this

many

as

it

that

so
still

the

very
fortunate

I
think
the
most

hundred

be
their
exemption

I
,
Uncommercial
Traveller

have
come
aboard
this
Emigrant

see
what
eight
hundred

I
find
them
(
to
the

overthrow
of
all
my
expectation
)
<EOS>
like
what
I
now
describe
with
scrupulous
exactness

<EOS>
the
Mormon
Agent
who
have
be
active
in

them
together
,
and
in
make
the
contract
with

take

<EOS>
a

handsome
man
in

rather
short
,
with
rich
brown
hair
and
beard
,
and
clear
bright
eye

<EOS>
from
his
speech
,
I
should
set
him
down
as
American
.
<EOS>
probably
,
a
man
who
have
"
knock
about
the

"
pretty
much
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
with
a
frank
open
manner

unshrinking

;
withal
a
man
of
great
quickness
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
wholly
ignorant
of
my
uncommercial
individuality
,
and
consequently
of
my
immense
uncommercial
importance
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
these
be
a
very
fine
set

you

here

<EOS>
MORMON

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
UNCOMMERCIAL
<EOS>
(
look
about

.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
eight
hundred
people
together
anywhere
else
,
and
find
so
much
beauty
and
so
much
strength
and
capacity
for
work
among
them

<EOS>
MORMON

It

me

be
all
so
cheery
,
and
make
so
little
of
the
immense

before
them
.
   
<EOS>
MORMON

<EOS>
well
,
you
see

many

then
they

<EOS>
industrious
people
who
come
out
to

soon
get
waggon
of

and
so
the
friend
of
some
of
these
will
come
down
in
their

<EOS>
They

We

before
her
extensive
skirt
have
depart
from
the
cask
,
a
decent
widow
stand
there
with
four
child
,
and
so
the
roll
go
.
   
<EOS>
the
face
of
some
of
the
Welsh
people
,
among
whom
there
be
many
old
person
,
be
certainly
the
least
intelligent
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
emigrant
would
have
bungle
sorely
,
but
for
the
direct
hand
that
be
always
ready
.
 
<EOS>
the
intelligence
here
be
unquestionably
of
a
low
order
,
and
the
head
be
of
a
poor
type
.
 
<EOS>
generally
the
case
be
the
reverse
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
wear
face
bear
trace
of
patient
poverty
and
hard
work
,
and
there
be
great
steadiness
of
purpose
and
much
undemonstrative
self
-
respect
among
this
class
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
young
man
be
go
singly
.
 
<EOS>
several
girl
be
go
,
two
or
three
together
.
 
<EOS>
these
latter
<EOS>
I
find
it
very
difficult
to
refer
back
,
in
my
mind
,
to
their
relinquished
home
and
pursuit
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
be
more
like
country
milliner
,
and
pupil
teacher
rather
tawdrily
dress
,
than
any
other
class
of
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
,
among
many
little
ornament
wear
,
more
than
one
photograph
-
brooch
of
the
Princess
of
Wales
,
and
also
of
the
late
Prince
Consort
.
 
<EOS>
some
single
woman
of
from
thirty
to
forty
,
whom
one
may
suppose
to
be
embroiderer
,
or
straw
-
bonnet
-
maker
,
be
obviously
go
out
in
quest
of
husband
,
as
fine
lady
go
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
that
they
have
any
distinct
notion
of
a
plurality
of
husband
or
wife
,
I
do
not
believe
.
 
<EOS>
to
suppose
the
family
group
of
whom
the
majority
of
emigrant
be
compose
,
polygamically
possess
,
would
be
to
suppose
an
absurdity
,
manifest
to
any
one
who
see
the
father
and
mother
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
say
(
I
have
no
means
of
ascertain
the
fact
)
that
most
familiar
kind
of
handicraft
trade
be
represent
here
.
<EOS>
farm
-
labourer
,
shepherd
,
and
the
like
,
have
their
full
share
of
representation
,
but
I
doubt
if
they
preponderate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
lead
spirit
in
the
family
circle
never
fail
to
show
itself
,
even
in
the
simple
process
of
answer
to
the
name
as
they
be
call
,
and
check
off
the
owner
of
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
it
be
the
father
,
much
oftener
<EOS>
the
mother
,
sometimes
a
quick
little
girl
second
or
third
in
order
of
seniority
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
occur
for
the
first
time
to
some
heavy
father
,
what
large
family
they
have
;
and
their
eye
roll
about
,
during
the
calling
of
the
list
,
as
if
they
half
misdoubte
some
other
family
to
have
be
smuggle
into
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
among
all
the
fine
handsome
child
,
I
observe
but
two
with
mark
upon
their
neck
that
be
probably
scrofulous
.
 
<EOS>
out
of
the
whole
number
of
emigrant

one
old

be
temporarily
set

towards
five

the

full

there
be

highly

I
go
on

bear
testimony
against

I
fully
believe

to
my

astonishment
they
do

I
go

such

churchyard
sometimes

always

so
silent

so

by

as
I
stand
peep
in
through
the
iron

I
can
peel
the
rusty
metal
off

like
bark

the

roof
of

stand
so
awry

that
they
can
hardly
be

<EOS>
old
crazy
stack
of
chimney
seem
to
look
down
as
they
overhang
,
dubiously
calculate
how
far
they

fall

in

there

look

I
hear
it
work
under

a

protest

<EOS>
one
of
my
good
beloved
churchyard
<EOS>
,
I
call
the
churchyard
of
Saint
Ghastly
Grim
;
touch
what
man
in
general
call
it
,
I
have
no
information
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
City
,
and
the
Blackwall
Railway
shriek
at
it
daily
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
small
churchyard
,
with
a
ferocious
,
strong
,
spiked
iron
gate
,
like
a
jail
.
 
<EOS>
this
gate
be
ornament
with
skull
and
cros
-
bone
,
large
than
the
life
,
work
in
stone
;
but
it
likewise
come
into
the
mind
of
Saint
Ghastly
Grim
,
that
to
stick
iron
spike
a
-
top
of
the
stone
skull
,
as
though
they
be
impale
,
would
be
a
pleasant
device
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
the
skull
grin
aloft
horribly
,
thrust
through
and
through
with
iron
spear
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
there
be
attraction
of
repulsion
for
me
in
Saint
Ghastly
Grim
,
and
,
have
often
contemplate
it
in
the
daylight
and
the
dark
,
I
once
feel
draw
towards
it
in
a
thunderstorm
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
in
self

excuse

<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
see
the

be
it
bad
to
go
to
see
Saint
Ghastly
Grim
by
the
light
of
the
lightning
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
repair
to
the
Saint
in
a
hackney
cab
,
and
find
the
skull
most
effective
,
have
the
air
of
a
public
execution
,
and
seem
,
as
the
lightning
flash
,
to
wink
and
grin
with
the
pain
of
the
spike
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
other
person
to
whom
to
impart
my
satisfaction
,
I
communicate
it
to
the
driver
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
from
be
responsive
,
he
survey
me
---
he
be
naturally
a
bottle
-
nosed
,
red
-
faced
man
---
with
a
blanch
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
drive
me
back
,
he
ever
and
again
glance
in
over
his
shoulder
through
the
little
front
window
of
his
carriage
,
as
mistrust
that
I
be
a
fare
originally
from
a
grave
in
the
churchyard
of
Saint
Ghastly
Grim
,
who
may
have
flit
home
again
without
pay
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
queer
Hall
of
some
queer
Company
give
upon
a
churchyard
such
as
this
,
and
,
when
the
Livery
dine
,
you
may
hear
them
(
if
you
be
look
in
through
the
iron
rail
,
which
you
never
be
when
I
be
)
toast
their
own
worshipful
prosperity
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
a
wholesale
house
of
business
,
require
much
room
for
stowage
,
will
occupy
one
or
two
or
even
all
three
side
of
the
enclose
space
,
and
the
back
of
bale
of
good
will
lumber
up
the
window
,
as
if
they
be
hold
some
crowd
trade
-
meeting
of
themselves
within

<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
command
window
be
all
blank
,
and
show
no
more
sign
of
life
than
the
grave
below
---
not
so
much
,
for
they
tell
of
what
once
upon
a
time
be
life
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
surrounding
of
one
City
churchyard
that
I
see
last
summer
,
on
a
volunteer
Saturday
evening
towards
eight
of
the
clock
,
when
with
astonishment
I
beheld
an
old
old
man
and
an
old
old
woman
in
it
,
make
hay
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
of
all
occupation
in
this
world
,
make
hay
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
confined
patch
of
churchyard
lie
between
Gracechurch

street
and
the
Tower
,
capable
of
yield
,
say
an
apronful
of
hay
.
 
<EOS>
by
what
mean
the
old
old
man
and
woman
have
get
into
it
,
with
an
almost
toothless
hay
-
make
rake
,
I
could
not
fathom
.
 
<EOS>
no
open
window
be
within
view
;
no
window
at
all
be
within
view
,
sufficiently
near
the
ground
to
have
enable
their
old
leg
to
descend
from
it
;
the
rusty
churchyard

gate
be
lock

the
mouldy
church
be
lock

<EOS>
gravely
among
the
grave
,
they
make
hay
,
all
alone
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
like
Time
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
the
one
rake
between
them
,
and
they
both
have
hold
of
it
in
a
pastorally
-
love
manner
,
and
there
be
hay
on
the
old
woman
's
black
bonnet
,
as
if
the
old
man
have
recently
be
playful
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
quite
an
obsolete
old
man
,
in
knee
-
breech
and
coarse
grey
stocking
,
and
the
old
woman
wear
mitten
like
unto
his
stocking
in
texture
and
in
colour
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
no
heed
of
me
as
I
look
on
,
unable
to
account
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
woman
be
much
too
bright
for
a
pew
-
opener
,
the
old
man
much
too
meek
for
a
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
on
an
old
tombstone
in
the
foreground
between
me
and
them
,
be
two
cherubim
;
but
for
those
celestial
embellishment
be
represent
as
have
no
possible
use
for
knee
-
breech
,
stocking
,
or
mitten
,
I
should
have
compare
them
with
the
hay
-
maker
,
and
seek
a
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
I
cough
and
awake
the
echo
,
but
the
hay
-
maker
never
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
use
the
rake
with
a
measured
action
,
draw
the
scanty
crop
towards
them
;
and
so
I
be
fain
to
leave
them
under
three
yard
and
a
half
of
darken
sky
,
gravely
make
hay
among
the
grave
,
all
alone
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
be
Spectres
,
and
I
want
a
Medium
.
   
<EOS>
in
another
City
churchyard
of
similar
cramped
dimension
,
I
see
,
that
selfsame
summer
,
two
comfortable
charity
child
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
make
love
---
tremendous
proof
of
the
vigour
of
that
immortal
article
,
for
they
be
in
the
graceful
uniform
under
which
English
Charity
delight
to
hide
herself
---
and
they
be
overgrow
,
and
their
leg
(
his
leg
at
least
,
for
I
be
modestly
incompetent
to
speak
of
her
)
be
as
much
in
the
wrong
as
mere
passive
weakness
of
character
can
render
leg
.
 
<EOS>
o
it
be
a
leaden
churchyard
,
but
no
doubt
a
golden
ground
to
those
young
person
!
 
<EOS>
I
first
see
them
on
a
Saturday
evening
,
and
,
perceive
from
their
occupation
that
Saturday
evening
be
their
trysting
-
time
<EOS>
,
I
return
that
evening
se'nnight
,
and
renew
the
contemplation
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
there
to
shake
the
bit
of
matting
which
be
spread
in
the
church
aisle
,
and
they
afterwards
roll
them
up
,
he
roll
his
end
,
she
roll
her
,
until
they
meet
,
and
over
the
two
once
divide
now
united
rolls
---
sweet
emblem
!
<EOS>
---
give
and
receive
a
chaste
salute
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
refreshing
to
find
one
of
my
faded
churchyard
bloom
into
flower
thus
,
that
I
return
a
second
time
,
and
a
third
,
and
ultimately
this
befell
:
---
They
have
leave
the
church
door
open
,
in
their
dusting
and
arranging
.
 
<EOS>
walk
in
to
look
at
the
church
,
I
become
aware
,
by
the
dim
light
,
of
him
in
the
pulpit
,
of
her
in
the
reading
-
desk
,
of
him
look
down
,
of
her
look
up
,
exchange
tender
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
both
dive
,
and
become
as
it
be
non
-
existent
on
this
sphere
.
 
<EOS>
with
an
assumption
of
innocence
I
turn
to
leave
the
sacred
edifice
,
when
an
obese
form
stand
in
the
portal
,
puffily
demand
Joseph
,
or
in
default
of
Joseph
,
Celia
.
<EOS>
take
this
monster
by
the
sleeve
,
and
lure
him
forth
on
pretence
of
show
him
whom
he
seek
,
I
give
time
for
the
emergence
of
Joseph
and
Celia
,
who
presently
come
towards
us
in
the
churchyard
,
bend
under
dusty
matting
,
a
picture
of
thriving
and
unconscious
industry
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
superfluous
to
hint
that
I
have
ever
since
deem
this
the
proud
passage
in
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
but
such
instance
,
or
any
token
of
vitality
,
be
rare
indeed
in
my
City
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
sparrow
occasionally
try
to
raise
a
lively
chirrup
in
their
solitary
tree
---
perhaps
,
as
take
a
different
view
of
worm
from
that
entertain
by
humanity
---
but
they
be
flat
and
hoarse
of
voice
,
like
the
clerk
,
the
organ
,
the
bell
,
the
clergyman
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
Church
-
work
when
they
be
wind
up
for
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
cage
lark
,
thrush
,
or
blackbird
,
hang
in
neighbouring
court
,
pour
forth
their
strain
passionately
,
as
scent
the
tree
,
try
to
break
out
,
and
see
leave
again
before
they
die
,
but
their
song
be
Willow
,
Willow
---
of
a
churchyard
cast
.
 
<EOS>
so
little
light
live
inside
the
church
of
my
churchyard
,
<EOS>
when
the
two
be
co
-
existent
,
that
it
be
often
only
by
an
accident
and
after
long
acquaintance
that
I
discover
their
have
stain
glass
in
some
odd
window
.
 
<EOS>
the
westere
sun
slant
into
the
churchyard
by
some
unwonted
entry
,
a
few
prismatic
tear
drop
on
an
old
tombstone
,
and
a
window
that
I
think
be
only
dirty
,
be
for
the
moment
all
bejewel
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
light
pass
and
the
colour
die
.
 
<EOS>
though
even
then
,
if
there
be
room
enough
for
me
to
fall
back
so
far
as
that
I
can
gaze
up
to
the
top
of
the
Church
Tower
,
I
see
the
rusty
vane
new
burnished
,
and
seem
to
look
out
with
a
joyful
flash
over
the
sea
of
smoke
at
the
distant
shore
of
country
.
   
<EOS>
blink
old
man
who
be
let
out
of
workhouse
by
the
hour
,
have
a
tendency
to
sit
on
bit
of
cope
stone
in
these
churchyard
,
lean
with
both
hand
on
their
stick
and
asthmatically
gasp
.
<EOS>
the
more
depressed
class
of
beggar
too
,
bring
hither
broken
meat
,
and
munch
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
on
nod
term
with
a
meditative
turncock
who
linger
in
one
of
them
,
and
whom
I
suspect
of
a
turn
for
poetry
;
the
rather
,
as
he
look
out
of
temper
when
he
give
the
fire
-
plug
a
disparaging
wrench
with
that
large
tuning
-
fork
of
his
which
would
wear
out
the
shoulder
of
his
coat
,
but
for
a
precautionary
piece
of
inlaid
leather
.
 
<EOS>
fire
-
ladder
,
which
I
be
satisfied
<EOS>
nobody
know
anything
about
,
and
the
key
of
which
be
lose
in
ancient
time
,
moulder
away
in
the
large
churchyard
,
under
eave
like
wooden
eyebrow
;
and
so
removed
be
those
corner
from
the
haunt
of
man
and
boy
,
that
once
on
a
fifth
of
November
I
find
a
"
Guy
"
trust
to
take
care
of
himself
there
,
while
his
proprietor
have
go
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
expression
of
his
face
I
can
not
report
,
because
it
be
turn
to
the
wall
;
but
his
shrug
shoulder
and
his
ten
extended
finger
,
appear
to
denote
that
he
have
moralise
in
his
little
straw
chair
on
the
mystery
of
mortality
until
he
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
.
   
<EOS>
You
do
not
come
upon
these
churchyard
violently
;
there
be
shape
of
transition
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
an
antiquated
news
shop
,
or
barber
's
shop
,
apparently
bereft
of
customer
in
the
early
day
of
George
the
Third
,
would
warn
me
to
look
out
for
one
,
if
any
discovery
in
this
respect
be
leave
for
me
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
quiet
court
,
in
combination
with
an
unaccountable
dyer
's
and
scourer
's
,
would
prepare
me
for
a
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
an
exceedingly
retire
public
-
house
,
with
a
bagatelle
-
board
shadily
visible
in
a
sawdusty
parlour
shape
like
an
omnibus
,
and
with
a
shelf
of
punch
-
bowl
in
the
bar
,
would
apprise
me
that
I
stand
near
consecrate
ground
.
 
<EOS>
a
"
dairy
,
"
exhibit
in
its
modest
window
<EOS>
one
very
little
milk
-
can
and
three
egg
,
would
suggest
to
me
the
certainty
of
find
the
poultry
hard
by
,
peck
at
my
forefather
.
 
<EOS>
I
first
infer
the
vicinity
of
Saint
Ghastly
Grim
,
from
a
certain
air
of
extra
repose
and
gloom
pervade
a
vast
stack
of
warehouse
.
   
<EOS>
from
the
hush
of
these
place
,
it
be
congenial
to
pass
into
the
hushed
resort
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
down
the
lane
I
like
to
see
the
cart
and
waggon
huddle
together
in
repose
,
the
crane
idle
,
and
the
warehouse
shut
.
 
<EOS>
pause
in
the
alley
behind
the
close
Banks
of
mighty
Lombard
-
street
,
it
give
one
as
good
as
a
rich
feeling
to
think
of
the
broad
counter
with
a
rim
along
the
edge
,
make
for
tell
money
out
on
,
the
scale
for
weigh
precious
metal
,
the
ponderous
ledger
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
bright
copper
shovel
for
shovel
gold
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
draw
money
,
it
never
seem
so
much
money
as
when
it
be
shovel
at
me
out
of
a
bright
copper
shovel
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
to
say
,
"
in
gold
,
"
and
to
see
seven
pound
musically
pour
out
of
the
shovel
,
like
seventy
;
the
Bank
appear
to
remark
to
me
---
I
italicise
APPEARING
---
"
if
you
want
more
of
this
yellow
earth
,
we
keep
it
in
barrow
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
think
of
the
banker
's
clerk
with
his
deft
finger
turn
the
crisp
edge
of
the
Hundred
-
Pound
Notes
he
have
take
in
a
fat
roll
out
of
a
drawer
,
be
again
to
hear
the
rustling
of
that
delicious
south

cash
wind
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
will
you
have
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
once
hear
this
usual
question
ask
at
a
Bank
Counter
of
an
elderly
female
,
habit
in
mourning
and
steep
in
simplicity
,
who
answer
,
open
-
eyed
,
crook
-
finger
,
laugh
with
expectation
,
"
anyhow
!
"
 
<EOS>
call
these
thing
to
mind
as
I
stroll
among
the
Banks
,
I
wonder
whether
the
other
solitary
Sunday
man
I
pass
,
have
design
upon
the
Banks
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
interest
and
mystery
of
the
matter
,
I
almost
hope
he
may
have
,
and
that
his
confederate
may
be
at
this
moment
take
impression
of
the
key
of
the
iron
closet
in
wax
,
and
that
a
delightful
robbery
may
be
in
course
of
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
about
College

hill
,
Mark
-
lane
,
and
so
on
towards
the
Tower
,
and
Dockward
,
the
desert
wine
-
merchant
'
cellar
be
fine
subject
for
consideration
;
but
the
deserted
money
-
cellar
of
the
Bankers
,
and
their
plate
-
cellar
,
and
their
jewel
-
cellar
,
what
subterranean
region
of
the
Wonderful
Lamp
be
these
!
 
<EOS>
and
again
:
possibly
some
shoeless
boy
in
rag
,
pass
through
this
street
yesterday
,
for
whom
it
be
reserve
to
be
a
Banker
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
and
to
be
surpass
rich
.
 
<EOS>
such
reverse
have
be
,
since
the
day
of
Whittington
;
and
be
,
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
whether
the
boy
have
any
foreglittering
of
that
glitter
fortune
now
,
when
he
tread
these
stone
,
hungry
.
 
<EOS>
much
as
I
also
want
to
know
whether
the
next
man
to
be
hang
at
Newgate
yonder
,
have
any
suspicion
upon
him
that
he
be
move
steadily
towards
that
fate
,
when
he
talk
so
much
about
the
last
man
who
pay
the
same
great
debt
at
the
same
small
Debtors

Door

<EOS>
where
be
all
the
people
who
on
busy
work
-
day
pervade
these
scene
?
 
<EOS>
the
locomotive
banker
's
clerk
,
who
carry
a
black
portfolio
chain
to
him
by
a
chain
of
steel
<EOS>
,
where
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
go
to
bed
with
his
chain
on
---
to
church
with
his
chain
on
---
or
do
he
lay
it
by
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
lay
it
by
,
what
become
of
his
portfolio
when
he
be
unchained
for
a
holiday
?
 
<EOS>
the
wastepaper
basket
of
these
close
counting

house
would
let
me
into
many
hint
of
business
matter
if
I
have
the
exploration
of
them
;
and
what
secret
of
the
heart
should
I
discover
on
the
"
pad
'
of
the
young
clerk
---
the
sheet
of
cartridge

paper
and
blotting

paper
interpose
between
their

their
desk
!
 
<EOS>
pad
be
take
into
confidence
on
the
tender
occasion
,
and
oftentime
when
I
have
make
a
business
visit
,
and
have
send
in
my
name
from
the
outer
office
,
have
I
have
it
force
on
my
discursive
notice
that
the
officiate
young
gentleman
have
over
and
over
again
inscribe
AMELIA
,
in
ink
of
various
date
,
on
corner
of
his
pad
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
pad
may
be
regard
as
the
legitimate
modern
successor
of
the
old
forest
-
tree
:
whereon
these
young
knight
(
have
no
attainable
forest
nearer
than
eppe
)
engrave
the
name
of
their
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
be
a
more
satisfactory
process
than
carve
,
and
can
be
oftener
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
so
these
court
in
their
Sunday
rest
be
court
of
love
omnipotent
<EOS>
(
I
rejoice
to
bethink
myself
)
,
dry
as
they
look
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
Garraway
's
,
bolt
and
shuttered
hard
and
fast
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
possible
to
imagine
the
man
who
cut
the
sandwich
,
on
his
back
in
a
hayfield
;
it
be
possible
to
imagine
his
desk
,
like
the
desk
of
a
clerk
at
church
,
without
him
;
but
imagination
be
unable
to
pursue
the
man
who
wait
at
Garraway
be
all
the
week
for
the
man
who
never
come
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
forcibly
put
out
of
garraway
's
on
Saturday
night
---
which
they
must
be
,
for
they
never
would
go
out
of
their
own
accord
---
where
do
they
vanish
until
Monday
morning
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
first
Sunday
that
I
ever
stray
here
,
I
expect
to
find
them
hover
about
these
lane
,
like
restless
ghost
,
and
try
to
peep
into
Garraway
's
through
chink
in
the
shutter
,
if
not
endeavour
to
turn
the
lock
of
the
door
with
false
key
,
pick
,
and
screw

driver
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
wonder
be
,
that
they
go
clean
away
!
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
of
it
,
the
wonder
be
,
that
every
work

day
pervader
of
these
scene
go
clean
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
sell
the
dog

collar
and
the
little
toy
coal
-
scuttle
,
feel
under
as
great
an
obligation
to
go

as

seem

wander

perhaps
from

<EOS>
come

<EOS>
there
be

at

far
advanced

tall

upright

who
,
become
aware

look
on

straighten
his

push
up
his

against

appear

defy

<EOS>
to
whom
I
pacifically
say

not

agree
with
me
.
<EOS>
---
"
be
you
a

"
<EOS>
he
then
ask
,
in
a
pointed
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
wonder

I

not

bent

<EOS>
in

make

the

presently

<EOS>
"
You

I
say
I
think
so
too

<EOS>
appear
to

he
lay
down
his

for
it

push
up

"
Would

stand
close

My

that
there

come
within

an

there
I

surely

the

It

chaise
take
off
its

plump
down

among
a

<EOS>
It

chaise
not

set
straight
upon

tilt
over
,
as

It

It

with
scrap

there

in

wait

<EOS>
none
come

<EOS>
at

I
make
my

back
to
the

London

by
the
further
end
of

garden
,
and
consequently
at
a
point
beyond
that
from

I

I
have
to
scramble
through
a
hedge

down
a
steep
bank

I
nearly
come
down
a

top
of
a
little
spare
man
who
sit
break
stone
by
the
roadside
.
   
<EOS>
He
stay
his

,
and
say
,
regard
me
mysteriously
through
his
dark
goggle
of
wire
:
   
<EOS>
"

do

"
   
<EOS>
the
stone

breaker
bend
his
brow
and
goggle
over
his
heap
of
stone
,
as
if
he
be
consider
whether
he
should
answer
the
question
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
raise
his
bar
eye
to
my
feature
as
before
,
he
say
:
   
"
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
be
quite
unprepared
for
the
reply
,
I
receive
it
with
a
sufficiently
awkward
"
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
dear
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
presently
I
add
,
"
do
you
---
"
I
be
go
to
say
"
live
there
,
"
but
it
seem
so
absurd
a
question
,
that
I
substitute
"
live
near

"
   
<EOS>
the
stone
-
breaker
,
who
have
not
break
a
fragment
since
we
begin
to
converse
,
then
do
as
follow
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
himself
by
poise
his
finger
on
his
hammer
,
and
take
his
coat
,
on
which
he
have
be
seat
,
over
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
back
to
an
easy
part
of
the
bank
than
that
by
which
I
have
come
down
,
keep
his
dark
goggle
silently
upon
me
all
the
time
,
and
then
shoulder
his
hammer
,
suddenly
turn
,
ascend
,
and
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
so
small
,
and
his
goggle
be
so
large
,
that
he
leave
me
wholly
uninforme
as
to
his
countenance
;
but
he
leave
me
a
profound
impression
that
the
curve
leg
I
have
see
from
behind
as
he
vanish
,
be
the
leg
of
an
old
postboy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
then
that
I
notice
he
have
be
work
by
a
grass
-
grow
milestone
,
which
look
like
a
tombstone
erect
over
the
grave
of
the
London
road
.
   
<EOS>
My
dinner
-
hour
be
close
at
hand
,
I
have
no
leisure
to
pursue
the
goggle
or
the
subject
then
,
but
make
my
way
back
to
the
Dolphin
's
Head
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
gateway
I
find
J
Mellows
,
look
at
nothing
,
and
apparently
experience
that
it
fail
to
raise
his
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
for
the

,
"
say
J
Mellows
,
when
I
compliment
him
on
the
sanitary
advantage
it
may
or
may
not
possess
;
"
I
wish
I
have
never
see
the

<EOS>
"
You

"
 
<EOS>
It
then
occur
to
me
that
Mellows
,
have
so
little
to
do

be
habitually
throw
back
on
his
internal
resource

by
which
I
mean
the
Dolphin

<EOS>
"
what

say
mellow

pull
off
his
hat

and
make
as
if
he
empty
it
of
the
last
load
of
Disgust
that
have
exude
from

put
it
on

I
find
the
document
in
question
stretch
out
flat
on
the
coffee

room
table
by
the
aid
of
certain
weight
from
the
kitchen

and
I
give
it
the
additional
weight
of
my
uncommercial
signature
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
I
bind
myself
to
the
modest
statement
that
universal
traffic

happiness
,
prosperity
,
and
civilisation
,
together
with
unbounded
national
triumph
in
competition
with

infallibly
flow
from
the

<EOS>
have
achieve
this
constitutional
feat
,
I
ask
Mr
Mellows
if
he
could
grace
my
dinner
with
a
pint
of
good
wine
?
 
<EOS>
Mr

thus
reply

the
shabbiness
of

capital

compare

Paris
,
Bordeaux
,
Frankfort
,
Milan
,
Geneva
---
almost
any
important
town

continent

I
find
very
striking
after
an
absence
of
any
duration
in
foreign
part

<EOS>
London
be
shabby
in
contrast
with
Edinburgh
,
with
Aberdeen
,
with
Exeter
,
with
Liverpool
,
with
a
bright
little
town
like
Bury
St

<EOS>
London
be
shabby
in
contrast
with
New
York
,
with
Boston
,
with
Philadelphia

<EOS>
in
detail
,
one
would
say
it
can
rarely
fail
to
be
a
disappointing
piece
of
shabbiness
,
to
a
stranger
from
any
of
those
place
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
shabbier
than
Drury
-
lane
,
in
Rome
itself
.
 
<EOS>
the
meanness
of
regent
-
street
,
set
against
the
great
line
of
Boulevards
in
Paris
,
be
as
striking
as
the
abortive
ugliness
of
Trafalgar
-
square
,
set
against
the
gallant
beauty
of
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
.
 
<EOS>
London
be
shabby
by
daylight
,
and
shabbier
by
gaslight
.
 
<EOS>
no
Englishman
know
what
gaslight
be
,
until
he
see
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
and
the
Palais
Royal
after
dark
.
   
<EOS>
the
mass
of
London
people
be
shabby
.
 
<EOS>
the
absence
of
distinctive
dress
have
,
no
doubt
,
something
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
porter
of
the
Vintners
'
Company
,
the
drayman
,
and
the
butcher
,
be
about
the
only
people
who
wear
distinctive
dress
;
and
even
these
do
not
wear
them
on
holiday
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
which
for
cheapness
,
cleanliness
,
convenience
,
or
picturesqueness
,
can
compare
with
the
belt
blouse
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
our
woman
;
---
next
Easter
or
Whitsuntide
,
look
at
the
bonnet
at
the
British
Museum
or
the
National
Gallery
,
and
think
of
the
pretty
white
french
cap
,
the
spanish
mantilla
,
or
the
genoese
mezzero
.
   
<EOS>
probably
there
be
not
more
second
-
hand
clothe
sell
in
London
than
in
Paris
,
and
yet
the
mass
of
the
London
population
have
a
second
-
hand
look
which
be
not
to
be
detect
on
the
mass
of
the
parisian
population
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
be
mainly
because
a
parisian
workman
do
not
in
the
least
trouble
himself
about
what
be
wear
by
a
parisian
idler
,
but
dress
in
the
way
of
his
own
class
,
and
for
his
own
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
in
London
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
fashion
descend
;
and
you
never
fully
know
how
inconvenient
or
ridiculous
a
fashion
be
,
until
you
see
it
in
its
last
descent
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
but
the
other
day
,
on
a
race
-
course
,
that
I
observe
four
people
in
a
barouche
derive
great
entertainment
from
the
contemplation
of
four
people
on
foot
.
<EOS>
the
four
people
on
foot
be
two
young
man
and
two
young
woman
;
the
four
people
in
the
barouche
be
two
young
man
and
two
young
woman
.
<EOS>
the
four
young
woman
be
dress
in
exactly
the
same
style
;
the
four
young
man
be
dress
in
exactly
the

style
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
two
couple
on
wheel
be
as
much
amuse
by
the
two
couple
on
foot
,
as
if
they
be
quite
unconscious
of
have
themselves
set
those
fashion
,

of
be
at
that
very

engage
in

be
it
only
in

descend
here

thence
shabbiness
arise

an

do

originate
in
the

and
in
the

peculiar
love
of
the
excitement
attendant
on
great

,
which
they
look
on
at

in

<EOS>
light
be
much
want

<EOS>
o
we
be
all
agree

,
we
must
not

the
crowd
of
gentlefolk
who
set
the
shamefully
dangerous
fashion

either

<EOS>
We
must
not
quite
forget
the
enterprise
director
of
an
Institution

mighty

pretence
,
who
make
the
low
sensation
as
strong
as
they
possibly
could
make
it
,
by

the
Blondin
rope
as
high

possibly

<EOS>
all
this
must
not

<EOS>
the

so

no

the

the

Gentlemen

<EOS>
Gentlemen

become
place
of
quiet
inoffensive
recreation
;
work
man
's
club
begin
to
follow
suit

<EOS>
if
work
man
have
seem
rather
slow
to
appreciate
advantage
of
combination
which
have
save
the
pocket
of
gentleman
,
and
enhance
their
comfort
,
it
be
because
work
man
could
scarcely
,
for
want
of
capital
,
originate
such
combination
without
help
;
and
because
help
have
not
be
separable
from
that
great
impertinence
,
Patronage
.
<EOS>
the
instinctive
revolt
of
his
spirit
against
patronage
,
be
a
quality
much
to
be
respect
in
the
English
working
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
base
of
the
base
of
his
good
quality
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
surprising
that
he
should
be
unduly
suspicious
of
patronage
,
and
sometimes
resentful
of
it
even
where
it
be
not
,
see
what
a
flood
of
washy
talk
have
be
let
loose
on
his
devoted
head
,
or
with
what
complacent
condescension
<EOS>
the
same
devoted
head
have
be
smooth
and
pat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
proof
to
me
of
his
self
-
control
that
he
never
strike
out
pugilistically
,
right
and
leave
,
when
address
as
one
of
"
My
friend
,
"
or
<EOS>
"
My
assemble
friend
;
"
that
he
do
not
become
inappeasable
,
and
run
amuck
like
a
Malay
,
whenever
he
see
a
bipe
in
broadcloth
get
on
a
platform
to
talk
to
him
;
that
any
pretence
of
improve
his
mind
,
do
not
instantly
drive
him
out
of
his
mind
,
and
cause
him
to
toss
his
oblige
patron
like
a
mad
bull
.
   
<EOS>
for
,
how
often
have
I
hear
the
unfortunate
working
man
lecture
,
as
if
he
be
a
little
charity
-
child
,
humid
as
to
his
nasal
development
,
strictly
literal
as
to
his
Catechism
,
and
call
by
Providence
to
walk
all
his

in
a

represent
on
festive
occasion
by
a
mug

<EOS>
what
popgun
of
joke
have
these
ear
tingle
to
hear
let
off
at
him
,
what
asinine
sentiment
,
what
impotent
conclusion
,
what
spelling
-
book
morality
,
what
adaptation
of
the
orator
's
insufferable
tediousness
to
the
assumed
level
of
his
understanding
!
 
<EOS>
if
his

drive

and
he
the

play
with
them

he
could
not
have
be
discourse
to
,
more
impertinently
and
absurdly
than
I
have
hear
him
discourse
to
time
innumerable
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
not
be
a
fool
or
a
fawner
,
he
have
come
to
acknowledge
his
patronage
by
virtually
say
:
 
"
let
me
alone

<EOS>
if
you
understand
me
no
better
than
that

sir

let

<EOS>
You
mean
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
but
I
do
not
like
it
,
and
I
will
not
come
here
again
to
have
any
more
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
whatever
be
do
for
the
comfort
and
advancement
of
the
work
man
must
be
so
far
do
by
himself
as
that
it
be
maintain
by
himself

<EOS>
and
there
must
be
in
it
no
touch

condescension

no
shadow
of

<EOS>
in
the
great
working
district

this
truth
be
study

understand

<EOS>
when
the
american
civil
war
render
it
necessary
,
first
in
Glasgow
,
and
afterwards
in
Manchester
,
that
the
work

should
be
show
how
to

themselves
of
the
advantage
derivable
from
system

from
the
combination

in

the

this

the

Supporting

Depot
(
not

and
one
would
rather
give
it

English

)
have
hire
a
newly

build
warehouse
that
it
find
to
let
;
therefore
it
be
not
establish
in
premise
specially
design

,
at

cost
they

well

be
light

well

clean

cheerful

<EOS>
They
consist
of
three
large
room
.
 
<EOS>
that
on
the
basement
story
be
the
kitchen

that
on

the
Public

at

<EOS>
a

be

<EOS>
the
cooking
be
do
,
with
much
economy
of
space
and
fuel
,
by
american
cooking
-
stove
,
and
by
young
woman
not
previously
,
bring
up

;
the
wall
and
pillar
of
the
two
dining
-
room
be
agreeably
brighten
with
ornamental
colour
;
the

be
capable
of
accommodate
six

eight
person
each
;
the
attendant
be
all
young
woman
,
becomingly
and
neatly
dress
,
and
dress
alike
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
whole
staff
be
female
,
with
the
exception
of
the
steward
or
manager
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
inquiry
be
direct
to
the
wage
of
this
staff
;
because
,
if
any
establishment
claim
to
be
self
-
support
,
live
upon
the
spoliation
of
anybody
or
anything
,
or
eke
out
a
feeble
existence
by
poor
mouth
and
beggarly
resource
(
as
too
many
so
-
call
mechanic
'
institution
do
)
,
I
make
bold
to
express
my
uncommercial
opinion
that
it
have
no
business
to
live
,
and
have
better
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
make
clear
to
me
by
the
account
book
,
that
every
person
employ
be
properly
pay
.
 
<EOS>
My
next
inquiry
be
direct
to
the
quality
of
the
provision
purchase
,
and
to
the
term
on
which
they
be
buy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
make
equally
clear
to
me
that
the
quality
be
the
very
good
,
and
that
all
bill
be
pay
weekly
.
 
<EOS>
My
next
inquiry
be
direct
to
the
balance
-
sheet
for
the
last
two
week
---
only
the
third
and
fourth
of
the
establishment
's
career
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
make
equally
clear
to
me
,
that
after
everything
buy
be
pay
for
,
and
after
each
week
be
charge
with
its
full
share
of
wage
,
rent
and
taxis
,
depreciation
of
plant
in
use
,
and
interest
on
capital
at
the
rate
of
four
per
cent
.
<EOS>
per
annum
,
the
last
week
have
yield
a
profit
of
(
in
round
number
)
<EOS>
one
pound
ten
;
and
the
previous
week
a
profit
of
six
pound
ten
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
feel
that
I
have
a
healthy
appetite
for
the
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
just
strike
twelve
,
and
a
quick
succession
of
face
have
already
begin
to
appear
at
a
little
window
in
the
wall
of
the
partition
space
where
I
sit
look
over
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
within
this
little
window
,
like
a
pay
-
box
at
a
theatre
,
a
neat
and
brisk
young
woman
preside
to
take
money

issue
ticket
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
come
in
must
take
a
ticket
.
 
<EOS>
either
the
fourpence
-
halfpenny
ticket
for
the
upper
room
(
the
most
popular
ticket
,
I
think
)
,
or
a
penny
ticket
for
a
bowl
of
soup
,
or
as
many
penny
ticket
as
he
or
she
choose
to
buy
.
 
<EOS>
for
three
penny
ticket
one
have
quite
a
wide
range
of
choice
.

a

a

of
cold

<EOS>
touch
what
they
should
have

some
customer
on
take
their
seat
fall
into
a
reverie
---
become
mildly
distracted
---
postpone
decision
,
and
say
in
bewilderment
,
they
would
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
one
old
man
I
notice
when
I
sit
among
the
table
in
the
low
room
,
who
be
startle
by
the
bill
of
fare
,
and
sit
contemplate
it
as
if
it
be
something
of
a
ghostly
nature
.
 
<EOS>
the
decision
of
the
boy
be
as
rapid
as
their
execution
,
and
always
include
pudding
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
several
woman
among
the
diner
,
and
several
clerk
and
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
carpenter
and
painter
from
the
neighbour
building
under
repair
,
and
there
be
nautical
man
,
and
there
be
,
as
one
diner
observe
to
me
,
"
some
of
most
sort
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
some
be
solitary
,
some
come
two
together
,
some
dine
in
party
of
three
or
four
,
or
six
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
talk
together
,
but
assuredly
no
one
be
loud
than
at
my
club
in
Pall
-
Mall
.
 
<EOS>
one
young
fellow
whistle
in
rather
a
shrill
manner
while
he
wait
for
his
dinner
,
but
I
be
gratify
to
observe
that
he
do
so
in
evident
defiance
of
my
uncommercial
individuality
.
 
<EOS>
quite
agree
with
him
,
on
consideration
,
that
I
have
no
business
to
be
there
,
unless
I
dine
like
the
rest

<EOS>
the
room
of
the
fourpence

halfpenny
banquet
have
,
like
the
low
room
,
a
counter
in
it
,
on
which
be

a
great
number
of
cold
portion
ready
for
distribution
.
 
<EOS>
behind
this

the
fragrant

steam
in
deep

and
the
best

cook
of
potato
be
fish
out
of
similar
receptacle
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
to
eat
be
touch
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
every
waitress
have
her
own
table
to
attend
to
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
see
a
new
customer
seat
himself
at
one
of
her
table
,
she
take
from
the
counter
all
his
dinner

his

meat

pudding

pile
it
up
dexterously
in
her
two
hand

set
it
before
him

and
take
his
ticket
.
 
<EOS>
this
serving
of
the
whole
dinner
at
once
,
have
be
find
greatly
to
simplify
the
business
of
attendance
,
and
be
also
popular
with
the
customer
:
 
who
be
thus
enable
to
vary
the
meal
by
vary
the
routine
of
dish
:
begin
with
soup
-
to

day
,
put
soup
in
the
middle
to

morrow
,
put
soup
at
the
end
the
day
after
to

morrow
,
and
ring
similar
change
on
meat
and
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
the
rapidity
with
which
every
new
-
comer
get
serve
,
be
remarkable
;
and
the
dexterity
with
which
the
waitress
(
quite
new
to
the
art
a
month
before
)
discharge
their
duty
,
be
as
agreeable
to
see
,
as
the
neat
smartness
with
which
they
wear
their
dress
and
have
dress
their
hair
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
seldom
see
better
wait
,
so
I
certainly
never
eat
well
meat
,
potato
,
or
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
soup
be
an
honest
and
stout
soup
,
with
rice
and
barley
in
it
,
and
"
little
matter
for
the
tooth
to
touch
,
"
as
have
be
observe
to
me
by
my
friend
below
stair
already
quote
.
 
<EOS>
the
dinner
-
service
,
too
,
be
neither
conspicuously
hideous
for
high
Art
nor
for
Low
Art
,
but
be
of
a
pleasant
and
pure
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
concern
the
viand
and
their
cookery
,
one
last
remark
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
at
my
club
in
Pall
-
Mall
aforesaid
,
a
few
day
afterwards
,
for
exactly
twelve
time
the
money
,
and
not
half
as
well
.
   
<EOS>
the
company
thicken
after
one
o'clock
strike
,
and
change
pretty
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
although
experience
of
the
place
have
be
so
recently
attainable
,
and
although
there
be
still
considerable
curiosity
out
in
the
street
and
about
the
entrance
,
the
general
tone
be
as
good
as
could
be
,
and
the
customer
fall
easily
into
the
way
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
to
me
,
however
,
that
they
be
there
to
have
what
they
pay
for
,
and
to
be
on
an
independent
footing
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
my
judgment
,
they
may
be
patronise
out
of
the
building
in
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
with
judicious
visiting
,
and
by
dint
of
be
question
,
read
to
,
and
talk
at
,
they
may
even
be
get
rid
of
(
for
the
next
quarter
of
a
century
)
in
half
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
this
disintereste
and
wise
movement
be
fraught
with
so
many
wholesome
change
in
the
life
of
the
work
people
,
and
with
so
much
good
in
the
way
of
overcome
that
suspicion
which
our
own
unconscious
impertinence
have
engender
,
that
it
be
scarcely
gracious
to
criticise
detail
as
yet
;
<EOS>
the
rather
,
because
it
be
indisputable
that
the
manager
of
the
Whitechapel
establishment
most
thoroughly
feel
that
they
be
upon
their
honour
with
the
customer
,
as
to
the
minute
point
of
administration
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
although
the
american
stove
can
not
roast
,
they
can
surely
boil
one
kind
of
meat
as
well
as
another
,
and
need
not
always
circumscribe
their
boiling
talent
within
the
limit
of
ham
and
beef
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
enthusiastic
admirer
of
those
substantial
,
would
probably
not
object
to
occasional
inconstancy
in
respect
of
pork
and
mutton
:
or
,
especially
in
cold
weather
,
to
a
little
innocent
trifling
with
irish
stew
,
meat
pie
,
and
toad
in
hole
.
 
<EOS>
another
drawback
on
the
Whitechapel
establishment
,
be
the
absence
of
beer
.
 
<EOS>
Regarded
merely
as
a
question
of
policy
,
it
be
very
impolitic
,
as
have
a
tendency
to
send
the
work
man
to
the
public
-
house
,
where
gin
be
report
to
be
sell
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
a
much
high
ground
on
which
this
absence
of
beer
be
objectionable
.
 
<EOS>
It
express
distrust
of
the
work
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fragment
of
that
old
mantle
of
patronage
in
which
so
many
estimable
thug
,
so
darkly
wander
up
and
down
the
moral
world
,
be
swear
to
muffle
him
.
 
<EOS>
good
beer
be
a
good
thing
for
him
,
he
say
,
and
he
like
it
;
the
Depot
could
give
it
him
good
,
and
he
now
get
it
bad
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
the
Depot
not
give
it
him
good
?
 
<EOS>
because
he
would
get
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
the
Depot
not
let
him
have
a
pint
with
his
dinner
,
which
would
not
make
him
drunk
?
<EOS>
because
he
may
have
have
another
pint
,
or
another
two
pint
,
before
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
this
distrust
be
an
affront
,
be
exceedingly
inconsistent
with
the
confidence
the
manager
express
in
their
hand
-
bill
,
and
be
a
timid
stop
-
short
upon
the
straight
highway
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
unjust
,
because
it
punish
the
sober
man
for
the
vice
of
the
drunken
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
unreasonable
,
because
any
one
at
all
experience
in
such
thing
know
that
the
drunken
workman
do
not
get
drunk
where
he
go
to
eat
and
drink
,
but
where
he
go
to
drink
---
expressly
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
to
suppose
that
the
work
man
can
not
state
this
question
to
himself
quite
as
plainly
as
I
state
it
here
,
be
to
suppose
that
he
be
a
baby
,
and
be
again
to
tell
him
in
the
old
wearisome
,
condescending
,
patronising
way
that
he
must
be
goody
-
poody
,
and
do
as
he
be
toldy
-
poldy
,
and
not
be
a
manny
-
panny
or
a
voter
-
poter
,
but
fold
his
handy
-
pandys
,
and
be
a
childy
-
pildy
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
from
the
account
of
the
Whitechapel
Self
-
Supporting
Cooking
Depot
,
that
every
article
sell
in
it
,
even
at
the
price
I
have

yield
a
certain
small
profit
!
 
<EOS>
individual
speculator
be
of

already
in

and
be
of

the
name

<EOS>
the
class
for
whose

the

be

will
distinguish
between
the

richly

the
active

pluck
their

ripe

in
the

the
heavy

light

flounder
down

the
light

imperiously

as
it

make
a
prodigious

about

watch

equally

be
the
posturing
sheep

upon

the

everything
within

by
the
aid

the

lend
itself
to
everything

<EOS>
one
of
these
landing

<EOS>
(

He
be
a
young

with
an
intelligent
face
burn
to
a
dust
colour
by
the
summer
sun
,
and
with
crisp
hair
of
the

hue
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
boy
in
whom
I
have
perceive
nothing
incompatible
with
habit
of
studious
inquiry
and
meditation
,
unless
an
evanescent
black
eye
(
I
be
delicate
of
inquire
how
occasioned
)
should
be
so
consider
.
 
<EOS>
to
him
be
I
indebte
for
ability
to
identify
a
Custom

house
boat
at

and
for
acquaintance
with
all

I

respect

malady
I

have
I
never

I
may
have
finish
my
mortal
career
and
never
know
that
when
I

a
white
horse
on
a

that
barge
be
a
lime
barge

<EOS>
for
precious
secret
in
reference
to
beer
,
be
I
likewise
behold
to
him
,
involve
warn
against
the
beer
of
a
certain
establishment
,
by
reason
of
its
have
turn
sour
through
failure
in
point

:
 
though
my
young
sage
be
not

opinion
that
similar
deterioration
have
befall
the

<EOS>
He
have
also
enlighten
me
touch

,
and
have
gently
reprove
my
ignorance

have
suppose
them

impregnate

<EOS>
His
manner
of
imparting
information
,
be
thoughtful
,
and
appropriate
to
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
recline
beside
me
,
he
pitch
into
the
river
,
a
little
stone
or
piece
of
grit
,
and
then
deliver
himself
oracularly
,
as
though
he
speak
out
of
the
centre
of
the
spread
circle
that
it
make
in

<EOS>
He
never
improve
my

observe
this
formula

<EOS>
with
the
wise
boy
---
whom
I
know
by
no
other
name
than
the
Spirit
of
the
Fort
---
I
recently
consort
on
a
breezy
day
when
the
river
leap
about
us
and
be
full
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
sheave
corn
carrying
in
the
golden
field
as
I
come
down
to
the
river
;
and
the
rosy
farmer
,
watch
his
labouring
-
man
in
the
saddle
on
his
cob
,
have
tell
me
how
he
have
reap
his
two
hundred
and
sixty
acre
of
long
-
straw
corn
last
week
,
and
how
a
well
week
's
work
he
have
never
do
in
all
his
day
.
 
<EOS>
peace
and
abundance
be
on
the
country
-
side
in
beautiful
form
and
beautiful
colour
,
and
the
harvest
seem
even
to
be
sail
out
to
grace
the
never
-
reap
sea
in
the
yellow
-
laden
barge
that
mellow
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
occasion
that
the
Spirit
of
the
Fort
,
direct
his
remark
to
a
certain
float
iron
battery
lately
lie
in
that
reach
of
the
river
,
enrich
my
mind
with
his
opinion
on
naval
architecture
,
and
inform
me
that
he
would
like
to
be
an
engineer
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
up
to
everything
that
be
do
in
the
contracting
line
by
Messrs.
Peto
and
Brassey
---
cunne
in
the
article
of
concrete
---
mellow
in
the
matter
of
iron
---
great
on
the
subject
of
gunnery
.
<EOS>
when
he
speak
of
pile
-
driving
and
sluice
-
making
,
he
leave
me
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
,
and
I
can
never
sufficiently
acknowledge
his
forbearance
with
me
in
my
disabled
state
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
thus
discourse
,
he
several
time
direct
his
eye
to
one
distant
quarter
of
the
landscape
,
and
speak
with
vague
mysterious
awe
of
"
the
Yard
.
"
 
<EOS>
ponder
his
lesson
after
we
have
part
,
I
bethink
me
that
the
Yard
be
one
of
our
large
public
Dockyards
,
and
that
it
lie
hide
among
the
crop
down
in
the
dip
behind
the
windmill
,
as
if
it
modestly
keep
itself
out
of
view
in
peaceful
time
,
and
seek
to
trouble
no
man
.
 
<EOS>
take
with
this
modesty
on
the
part
of
the
Yard
,
I
resolve
to
improve
the
Yard
's
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
My
good
opinion
of
the
Yard
's
retire
character
be
not
dash
by
nearer
approach
.
 
<EOS>
It
resound
with
the
noise
of
hammer
beat
upon
iron
;
and
the
great
shed
or
slip
under
which
the
mighty
man
-
of

war
be
build
,
loom
business
-
like
when
contemplate
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
that
,
however
,
the
Yard
make
no
display
,
but
keep
itself
snug
under
hill
-
side
of
corn
-
field
,
hop
-
garden
,
and
orchard
;
its
great
chimney

thrust
out

I

I

be
many

arise
from

that
internally

finish

ever
begin

and
half
of
her

be
smash
,
and
yet
the
remain
half
suffice

be
sound

<EOS>
then
,
to
go
over
the
side
again
and
down
among
the
ooze
and
wet
to
the
bottom
of
the
dock
,
in
the
depth
of
the
subterranean
forest
of

shore

stay

her
up

and
to
see
the
immense

bulge
out
against
the
upper

taper
down

me
,
be
,
with
great
pain

much
clambering

to
arrive
at
an
impossibility
of
realise
that
this
be
a

at
all

to
become
possess

the
fancy
that
it
be
an
enormous
immovable

set
up
in
an
ancient

(
say

that
at

almost

yet
what
would
even
these

be

without
the
tributary

the
mechanical

for
pierce
the

four

shape
them
under
hydraulic
pressure

<EOS>
the

merely
a
pretty

who
put

<EOS>
how
such
a
prodigious
mass
as
the
Achilles
can
ever
be
hold
by
such
comparatively
little
anchor
as
those
intend
for
her
and
lie
near
her
here
,
be
a
mystery
of
seamanship
which
I
will
refer
to
the
wise
boy
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
should
as
soon
have
think
of
tether
an
elephant
to
a
tent
-
peg
,
or
the
large
hippopotamus
in
the
Zoological
Gardens
to
my
shirt
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
Yonder
in
the
river
,
alongside
a
hulk
,
lie
two
of
this
ship
's
hollow
iron
mast
.
 
<EOS>
they
be
large
enough
for
the
eye
,
I
find
,
and
so
be
all
her
other
appliance
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
only
her
anchor
look
small
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
present
time
to
think
about
it
,
for
I
be
go
to
see
the
workshop
where
they
make
all
the
oar
use
in
the
British
Navy
.
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
large
pile
of
building
,
I
opine
,
and
a
pretty
long
job
!
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
building
,
I
be
soon
disappointed
,
because
the
work
be
all
do
in
one
loft
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
a
long
job
---
what
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
two
rather
large
mangle
with
a
swarm
of
butterfly
hover
over
them
?
 
<EOS>
what
can
there
be
in
the
mangle
that
attract
butterfly
?
   
<EOS>
draw
nearer
<EOS>
,
I
discern
that
these
be
not
mangle
,
but
intricate
machine
,
set
with
knife
and
saw
and
plane
,
which
cut
smooth
and
straight
here
,
and
slantwise
there
,
and
now
cut
such
a
depth
,
and
now
miss
cut
altogether
,
accord
to
the
predestined
requirement
of
the
piece
of
wood
that
be
push
on
below
them
:
each
of
which
piece
be
to
be
an
oar
,
and
be
roughly
adapt
to
that
purpose
before
it
take
its
final
leave
of
far
-
off
forest
,
and
sail
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
likewise
I
discern
that
the
butterfly
be
not
true
butterfly
,
but
wooden
shaving
,
which
,
be
spirt
up
from
the
wood
by
the
violence
of
the
machinery
,
and
keep
in
rapid
and
not
equal
movement
by
the
impulse
of
its
rotation
on
the
air
,
flutter
and
play
,
and
rise
and
fall
,
and
conduct
themselves
as
like
butterfly
as
heart
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
the
noise
and
motion
cease
,
and
the
butterfly
drop
dead
.
 
<EOS>
an
oar
have
be
make
since
I
come
in
,
want
the
shaped
handle
.
 
<EOS>
as
quickly
as
I
can
follow
it
with
my
eye
and
think
,
<EOS>
the

oar
be
carry
to
a
turning
lathe

a

and
a
Nick

<EOS>
Oar

<EOS>
the
exquisite
beauty
and
efficiency
of
this
machinery
need
no
illustration
,
but
happen
to
have
a
pointed

to

day

<EOS>
a

of
oar
of
unusual
size
chance

for
a
special
purpose
,
and
they
have

make

<EOS>
side

the
subtle
and
facile
machine
,
and
side
by

with
the
fast
-
grow
pile
of
oar
on
the
floor
,
a
man
shape
out
these
special
oar
with
an
axe
.
 
<EOS>
attend
by
no
butterfly
,
and
chipping
and
dinting
,
by
comparison
as
leisurely
as
if
he
be

Pagan
get

his

,
the

(
<EOS>
age
about
thirty

ply
his

<EOS>
the
machine
would
make
a
regulation
oar
while
the

wipe
his

<EOS>
the

may
be
bury
in
a

make

thin

broad

wooden

<EOS>
pass
from
this
wonderful
sight
to
the
ship
again
---
for
my
heart
,
as
to
the
Yard
,
be
where
the

be
---
I
notice
certain
unfinished
wooden
wall
leave
season
on
the
stock
,
pende
the
solution
of
the
merit
of
the
wood
and
iron
question

and
have
an
air
of
bide
their
time
with
surly
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
these
worthy
be
set
up
beside
them
,
together
with
their
capacity
in
gun
---
a
custom
highly
conducive
to
ease
and
satisfaction
in
social
intercourse
,
if
it
could
be
adapt
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
by
a
plank
more
gracefully
pendulous
than
substantial
,
I
make
bold
to
go
aboard
a
transport
ship
(
iron
screw
)
<EOS>
just
send
in
from
the
contractor
's
yard
to
be
inspect
and
pass
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
very
gratifying
experience
,
in
the
simplicity
and
humanity
of
her
arrangement
for
troop
,
in
her
provision
for
light
and
air
and
cleanliness
,
and
in
her
care
for
woman
and
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
,
as
I
explore
her
,
that
I
would
require
a
handsome
sum
of
money
to
go
aboard
her
,
at
midnight
by
the
Dockyard
bell
,
and
stay
aboard
alone
till
morning
;
for
surely
she
must
be
haunt
by
a
crowd
of
ghost
of
obstinate
old
martinet
,
mournfully
flap
their
cherubic
epaulette
over
the
change
time
.
 
<EOS>
though
still
we
may
learn
from
the
astounding
way
and
mean
in
our
yard
now
,
more
highly
than
ever
to
respect
the
forefather
who
get
to
sea
,
and
fight
the
sea
,
and
hold
the
sea
,
without
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
remembrance
put
me
in
the
good
of
temper
with
an
old
hulk
,
very
green
as
to
her
copper
,
and
generally
dim
and
patched
,
I
pull
off
my
hat
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
which

downy

and
to

heartily
welcome
<EOS>

I
be

have
be

by
the
steam
circular

perpendicular

horizontal

of
eccentric

,
I
come
to
the
saunter

and
consequently
to
the
core
of
my
uncommercial
pursuit
.
   
<EOS>
everywhere
,
as
I
saunter
up
and
down
the
Yard
,
I
meet
with
token
of
its
quiet

retire
character
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
gravity
upon
its

a
staid
pretence
of

nothing
worth

an
avoidance

which
I
never

the

no

his
twelve

man
(
not

than
a
few
occasional

.
 
<EOS>
but
for
a
whisper
in
the
air
suggestive
of
sawdust

shaving
,
the

<EOS>
when
I
be
a
child
<EOS>
(
the
Yard
be
then
familiar
to
me

<EOS>
I
use
to
think
that
I
should
like
to
play
at
Chinese
Enchanter
,
and
to
have
that
apparatus
place
at
my
disposal
for
the
purpose
by
a
beneficent
country

<EOS>
I
still
think
that
I
should
rather
like
to
try
the
effect
of
write
a
book
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Its
retirement
be
complete
,
and
to
go
glide
to

fro
among
the
stack
of
timber
would
be
a
convenient
kind
of
travel
in
foreign
country

among
the
forest
of
North
America
,
the
sodden
Honduras
swamp
,
the
dark
pine

,
the
norwegian
frost
,
and
the
tropical
heat
,
rainy

,
and
thunderstorm

<EOS>
the
costly
store
of
timber
be
stack
and
stow
away
in
sequestered
place
,
with
the
pervading
avoidance
of
flourish
or
effect

<EOS>
It
make
as
little

as
possible

and
call
to
no

<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
pick

pick
out

pick

<EOS>
strangely
twisted
piece
lie
about
,
precious
in
the
sight
of

<EOS>
saunter
through
these
grove
,
I
come
upon
an
open
glade
where
workman
be
examine
some
timber
recently
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
quite
a
pastoral
scene
,
with
a
background
of
river

windmill

<EOS>
and
no
more

the
American

<EOS>
sauntering
among
the
ropemaking
,
I
be
spin
into
a
state
of
blissful
indolence
,
wherein
my
rope
of
life
seem
to
be
so
untwisted
by
the
process
as
that
I
can
see
back
to
very
early
day
indeed
,
when
my
bad
dream
---
they
be
frightful
,
though
my
more
mature
understanding
have
never
make
out
why
---
be
of
an
interminable
sort
of
ropemaking
,
with
long
minute
filament
for
strand
,
which
,
when
they
be
spin
home
together
close
to
my

occasion
scream
.
 
<EOS>
next
,
I
walk
among
the
quiet
loft
of
store

of
sails
,
spar
,
rig
,
<EOS>
ship

---
determine
to
believe
that
somebody
in
authority
wear
a
girdle
and
bend
beneath
the
weight
of
a
massive
bunch
of
key
,
and
that
,
when
such
a
thing
be
want
,
he
come
tell
his
key
like
Blue

,
and
open
such
a
door
.
<EOS>
impassive
as
the
long
loft
look
,
let
the
electric
battery
send
down
the
word
,
and
the
shutter
and
door
shall
fly
open
,
and
such
a
fleet
of
armed
ship
,
under
steam
and
under
sail
,
shall
burst
forth
as
will
charge
the
old
Medway

where
the
merry
Stuart
let
the

while
his
not
so
merry
sailor
starve
in
the
street

with
something
worth
look
at

carry
to

<EOS>
thus
I
idle
round
to
the
Medway
again
,
where
it
be
now
flood
tide
;
and
I
find
the
river
evince
a
strong
solicitude
to
force
a

<EOS>
to

the

I

<EOS>
It
be
a
ball
of
great
good
humour
and
of
great
enjoyment
,
though
very
many
of
the
dancer
must
have
be
as
poor
as
the
fifteen
subject
of
the
P
Salcy
Family
.
   
<EOS>
in
short
,
not
have
take
my
own
pet
national
pint
pot
with
me
to
this
Fair
,
I
be
very
well
satisfied
with
the
measure
of
simple
enjoyment
that
it
pour
into
the
dull
french
-
flemish
country
life
.
<EOS>
how
dull
that
be
,
I
have
an
opportunity
of
consider
 
---
when
the
Fair
be
over
---
when
the
tri
-
coloured
flag
be
withdraw
from
the
window
of
the
house
on
the
place
where
the
Fair
be
hold
---
when
the
window
be
close
shut
,
apparently
until
next
fair
-
time
---
when
the
Hotel
de
Ville
have
cut
off
its
gas
and
put
away
its
eagle
---
when
the
two
paviour
,
whom
I
take
to
form
the
entire
paving
population
of
the
town
,
be
ram
down
the
stone
which
have
be
pull
up
for
the
erection
of
decorative
pole
---
when
the
jailer
have
slam
his
gate
,
and
sulkily
lock
himself
in
with
his
charge
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
as
I
pace
the
ring
which
mark
the
track
of
the
depart
hobby
-
horse
on
the
market

place
,
ponder
in
my
mind
how
long
some
hobby

horse
do
leave
their
track
in
public
way
,
and
how
difficult
they
be
to
erase
,
my
eye
be
greet
with
a
goodly
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
beheld
four
male
personage
thoughtfully
pace
the
place
together
,
in
the
sunlight
,
evidently
not
belong
to
the
town
,
and
have
upon
them
a
certain
loose
cosmopolitan
air
of
not
belong
to
any
town
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
clothe
in
a
suit
of
white

,
another
in
a

the
third
in
an
old

,
the
fourth
in

<EOS>
My

beat
high
;
for
,
in
those
four
male
personage
,
although
complexionless
and
eyebrowless
,
I
beheld
four
subject
of
the
Family
P

.
<EOS>
Blue

bearded
though
they
be

and
bereft
of
the

by
what

a

(

in
fact
,
whitening
,
judiciously
apply
to
the
jaw
with
the
palm

,
I
recognise
them
.
<EOS>
as
I
stand
admire
,
there
emerge
from
the
yard
of
a
lowly
Cabaret
,
the
excellent
Ma

Ma

with

"

word

so

that
when
they
all

he
go

,
dance
with
his

stick
angularly
into
the
pocket
of
his
canvas

after
the
Pierrot

<EOS>
glance
down
the
yard
,
the
last
I
see
of
him
be
,
that
he
look
in
through
a
window
(
at
the
soup
,
no
doubt
)
on
one
leg
.
   
<EOS>
full
of
this
pleasure
,
I
shortly
afterwards
depart
from
the
town
,
little
dreaming
of
an
addition
to
my
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
but
more
be
in
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
by
a
train
which
be
heavy
with
third
-
class
carriage
,
full
of
young
fellow
(
well
guard
)
who
have
draw
unlucky
number
in
the
last
conscription
,
and
be
on
their
way
to
a
famous
french
garrison
town
where
much
of
the
raw
military
material
be
work
up
into
soldiery
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
station
they
have
be
sit
about
,
in
their
threadbare
homespun
blue
garment
,
with
their
poor
little
bundle
under
their
arm
,
cover
with
dust
and
clay
,
and
the
various
soil
of
France
;
sad
enough
at
heart
,
most
of
them
,
but
put
a
good
face
upon
it
,
and
slap
their
breast
and
singe
chorus
on
the
small
provocation
;
the
gay
spirit
shoulder
half
loaf
of
black
bread
spear
upon
their
walking
-
stick
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
go
along
,
they
be
audible
at
every
station
,
chorus
wildly
out
of
tune
,
and
feign
the
high
hilarity
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
however
,
they
begin
to
leave
off
singe
,
and
to
laugh
naturally
,
while
at
interval
there
mingle
with
their
laughter
the
barking
of
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
to
alight
short
of
their
destination
,
and
,
as
that
stoppage
of
the
train
be
attend
with
a
quantity
of
horn
blowing
,
bell
ringing
,
and
proclamation
of
what
Messieurs
les
Voyageurs
be
to
do
,
and
be
not
to
do
,
in
order
to
reach
their
respective
destination
,
I
have
ample
leisure
to
go
forward
on
the
platform
to
take
a
parting
look
at
my
recruit
,
whose
head
be
all
out
at
window
,
and
who
be
laugh
like
delighted
child
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
perceive
that
a
large
poodle
with
a
pink
nose
,
who
have
be
their
travel
companion
and
the
cause
of
their
mirth
,
stand
on
his
hind
-
leg
present
arm
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
platform
,
ready
to
salute
them
as
the
train
go
off
.
<EOS>
this
poodle
wear
a
military
shako
(
it
be
unnecessary
to
add
,
very
much
on
one
side
over
one
eye
)
,
a
little
military
coat
,
and
the
regulation
white
gaiter
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
armed
with
a
little
musket
and
a
little
sword
-
bayonet
,
and
he
stand
present
arm
in
perfect
attitude
,
with
his
unobscured
eye
on
his
master
or
superior
officer
,
who
stand
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
admirable
be
his
discipline
,
that
,
when
the
train
move
,
and
he
be
greet
with
the
part
cheer
of
the
recruit
,
and
also
with
a
shower
of
centime
,
several
of
which
strike
his
shako
,
and
have
a
tendency
to
discompose
him
,
he
remain
staunch
on
his
post
,
until
the
train
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
resign
his
arm
to
his
officer
,
take
off
his
shako
by
rub
his
paw
over
it
,
drop
on
four
leg
,
bring
his
uniform
coat
into
the
absurd
relation
with
the
overarch
sky
,
and
run
about
the
platform
in
his
white
gaiter
,
wage
his
tail
to
an
exceed
great
extent
.
 
<EOS>
It
strike
me
that
there
be
more
waggery
than
this
in
the
poodle
,
and
that
he
know
that
the
recruit
would
neither
get
through
their
exercise
,
nor
get
rid
of
their
uniform
,
as
easily
as
he
;
revolve
which
in
my
thought
,
and
seek
in
my
pocket
some
small
money
to
bestow
upon
him
,
I
casually
direct
my
eye
to
the
face
of
his
superior
officer
,
and
in
him
beheld
the
face
-
maker
!
<EOS>
though
it
be
not
the
way
to
Algeria
,
but
quite
the
reverse
,
the
military
poodle

Colonel
be
the
face
-
maker
in
a
dark
blouse
,
with
a
small
bundle
dangle
over
his
shoulder
at
the
end
of
an
umbrella
,
and
take
a
pipe
from
his
breast
to
smoke
as
he

their
mysterious

Medicine
Men
of
civilisation
 
My
voyage
(
in
paper
boat
)
among
savage
often
yield
me
matter
for
reflection
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
trace
the
savage
in
the
civilised
man
,
and
to
detect
the
hold
of
some
savage
custom
on
condition
of
society
rather
boastful
of
be
high
above
them
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
be
the
Medicine
Man
of
the
north
American
Indians
never
to
be
get
rid
of
,
out
of
the
north
american
country
?
 
<EOS>
He
come
into
my
Wigwam
on
all
manner
of
occasion
,
and
with
the
absurdest
"
Medicine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
always
find
it
extremely
difficult
,
and
I
often
find
it
simply
impossible
,
to
keep
him
out
of
my
Wigwam
.
 
<EOS>
for
his
legal
"
Medicine
"
he
stick
upon
his
head
the
hair
of
quadruped
,
and
plaster
the
same
with
fat
,
and
dirty
white
powder
,
and
talk
a
gibberish
quite
unknown
to
the
man
and
squaw
of
his
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
for
his
religious
"
Medicine
"
he
put
on
puffy
white
sleeve
,
little
black
apron
,
large
black
waistcoat
of
a
peculiar
cut
,
collarless
coat
with
medicine
button
-
hole
,
medicine
stocking
and
gaiter
and
shoe
,
and
top
the
whole
with
a
highly
grotesque
medicinal
hat
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
to
be
sure
,
I
be
quite
free
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
occasion
when
the
Medicine
Men
in
general
,
together
with
a
large
number
of
the
miscellaneous
inhabitant
of
his
village
,
both
male
and
female
,
be
present
to
the
principal
Chief
,
his
native
"
Medicine
"
be
a
comical
mixture
of
old
odd
and
end
(
hire
of
trader
)
and
new
thing
in
antiquated
shape
,
and
piece
of
red
cloth
(
of
which
he
be
particularly
fond
)
,
and
white
and
red
and
blue
paint
for
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
irrationality
of
this
particular
Medicine
culminate
in
a
mock
battle
-
rush
,
from
which
many
of
the
squaw
be
bear
out
,
much
dilapidated
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
observe
how
unlike
this
be
to
a
Drawing
Room
at
St
James
's
Palace
.
   
<EOS>
the
african
magician
I
find
it
very
difficult
to
exclude
from
my
Wigwam
too
.
 
<EOS>
this
creature
take
case
of
death
and
mourn
under
his
supervision
,
and
will
frequently
impoverish
a
whole
family
by
his
preposterous
enchantment
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
eater
and
drinker
,
and
always
conceal
a
rejoice
stomach
under
a
grieving
exterior
.
<EOS>
His
charm
consist
of
an
infinite
quantity
of
worthless
scrap
,
for
which
he
charge
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
He
impress
on
the
poor
bereave
native
,
that
the
more
of
his
follower
they
pay
to
exhibit
such
scrap
on
their
person
for
an
hour
or
two
(
though
they
never
see
the
deceased
in
their
life
,
and
be
put
in
high
spirit
by
his
decease
)
,
the
more
honourably
and
piously
they
grieve
for
the
dead
.
<EOS>
the
poor
people
submit
themselves
to
this
conjurer
,
an
expensive
procession
be
form
,
in
which
bit
of
stick
,
feather
of
bird
,
and
a
quantity
of
other
unmeaning
object
besmear
with
black
paint
,
be
carry
in
a
certain
ghastly
order
of
which
no
one
understand
the
meaning
,
if
it
ever
have
any
,
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
,
and
be
then
bring
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
Tonga
Islands
everything
be
suppose
to
have
a
soul
,
so
that
when
a
hatchet
be
irreparably
break
,
they
say
,
"
His
immortal
part
have
depart
;
he
be
go
to
the
happy
hunting
-
plain
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
belief
lead
to
the
logical
sequence
that
when
a
man
be
bury
,
some
of
his
eating
and
drink
vessel
,
and
some
of
his
warlike
implement
,
must
be
break
and
bury
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
superstitious
and
wrong
,
but
surely
a
more
respectable
superstition
than
the
hire
of
antic
scrap
for
a
show
that
have
no
meaning
base
on
any
sincere
belief
.
   
<EOS>
let
me
halt
on
my
Uncommercial
road
,
to
throw
a
pass
glance
on
some
funeral
solemnity
that
I
have
see
where
north
American
Indians
,
African
Magicians
,
and
Tonga
Islanders
,
be
suppose
not
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
once
,
I
dwelt
in
an
italian
city
,
where
there
dwelt
with
me
for
a
while
,
an
Englishman
of
an
amiable
nature
,
great
enthusiasm
,
and
no
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
this
friend
discover
a
desolate
stranger
,
mourn
over
the
unexpected
death
of
one
very
dear
to
him
,
in
a
solitary
cottage
among
the
vineyard
of
an
outlying
village
.
 
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
the
bereavement
be
unusually
distress
;
and
the
survivor
,
new
to
the
peasant
and
the
country
,
sorely
need
help
,
be
alone
with
the
remain
.
 
<EOS>
with
some
difficulty
,
but
with
the
strong
influence
of
a
purpose
at
once
gentle
,
disintereste
,
and
determine
,
my
friend
---
Mr
Kindheart
---
obtain
access
to
the
mourner
,
and
undertake
to
arrange
the
burial
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
small
protestant
cemetery
near
the
city
wall
,
and
as
Mr
Kindheart
come
back
to
me
,
he
turn
into
it
and
choose
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
highly
flushed
when
render
a
service
unaide
,
and
I
know
that
to
make
him
happy
I
must
keep
aloof
from
his
ministration
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
at
dinner
he
warm
with
the
good
action
of
the
day
,
and
conceive
the
brilliant
idea
of
comfort
the
mourner
with
"
an
english
funeral
,
"
I
venture
to
intimate
that
I
think
that
institution
,
which
be
not
absolutely
sublime
at
home
,
may
prove
a
failure
in
italian
hand
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
Mr
Kindheart
be
so
enraptured
with
his
conception
,
that
he
presently
write
down
into
the
town
request
the
attendance
with
to
-
morrow
's
early
light
of
a
certain
little
upholsterer
.
 
<EOS>
this
upholsterer
be
famous
for
speak
the
unintelligible
local
dialect
(
his
own
)
in
a
far
more
unintelligible
manner
than
any
other
man
alive
.
   
<EOS>
when
from
my
bath
next
morning
I
overhear
Mr
Kindheart
and
the
upholsterer
in
conference
on
the
top
of
an
echoing
staircase
;
and
when
I
overhear
Mr
Kindheart
render
English
Undertaking
phrase
into
very
choice
italian
,
and
the
upholsterer
replying
in
the
unknown
Tongues
;
and
when
I
furthermore
remember
that
the
local
funeral
have
no
resemblance
to
english
funeral
;
I
become
in
my
secret
bosom
apprehensive
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Kindheart
inform
me
at
breakfast
that
measure
have
be
take
to
ensure
a
signal
success
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
funeral
be
to
take
place
at
sunset
,
and
as
I
know
to
which
of
the
city
gate
it
must
tend
,
I
go
out
at
that
gate
as
the
sun
descend
,
and
walk
along
the
dusty

dusty

<EOS>
I

not

when
I

<EOS>
I
may
have
be
seven
or
eight
year
old

young
enough
,
certainly
,
to
feel
rather
alarm
by
the
expression

as
not

where
the

terminate

and
how
far
I

to

the

(

,
and
be
admonish
that
if
,
when
the
funeral
be
in
action
,
I
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
,
or
take
my
eye
out
of
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
I
be
personally
lose
,
and
my
family
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
eventful
day
,
have
try
to
get
myself
into
a
disastrous
frame
of
mind
,
and
have
form
a
very
poor
opinion
of
myself
because
I
could
not
cry
,
I
repair
to
Sally
's
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
be
an
excellent
creature
,
and
have
be
a
good
wife
to
old
flander
,
but
the
moment
I
see
her
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
be
not
in
her
own
real
natural
state
.
 
<EOS>
She
form
a
sort
of
coat
of
Arms
,
group
with
a
smell
-
bottle
,
a
handkerchief
,
an
orange
,
a
bottle
of
vinegar
,
Flanders
's
sister
,
her
own
sister
,
Flanders
's
brother
's
wife
,
and
two
neighbouring
gossip
---
all
in
mourning
,
and
all
ready
to
hold
her
whenever
she
faint
.
 
<EOS>
at
sight
of
poor
little
me
she
become
much
agitated
(
agitate
me
much
more
)
,
and
have
exclaim
,
"
o
here
be
dear
Master
Uncommercial
!
"
become
hysterical
,
and
swoon
as
if
I
have
be
the
death
of
her
.
<EOS>
an
affect
scene
follow
,
during
which
I
be
hand
about
and
poke
at
her
by
various
people
,
as
if
I
be
the
bottle
of
salt
.
<EOS>
revive
a
little
,
she
embrace
me
,
say
,
"
You
know
him
well
,
dear
Master
Uncommercial
,
and
he
know
you
!
"
and
faint
again
:
 
which
,
as
the
rest
of
the
Coat
of
Arms
soothingly
say
,
"
do
her
credit
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
I
know
that
she
nee
not
have
faint
unless
she
like
,
and
that
she
would
not
have
faint
unless
it
have
be
expect
of
her
,
quite
as
well
as
I
know
it
at
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
feel
uncomfortable
and
hypocritical
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
but
that
it
may
be
manner
in
me
to
faint
next
,
and
I
resolve
to
keep
my
eye
on
Flanders
's
uncle
,
and
if
I
see
any
sign
of
his
go
in
that
direction
,
to
go
too
,
politely
.
 
<EOS>
but
Flanders
's
uncle
(
who
be
a
weak
little
old
retail
grocer
)
have
only
one
idea
,
which
be
that
we
all
want
tea
;
and
he
hand
us
cup
of
tea
all
round
,
incessantly
,
whether
we
refuse
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
young
nephew
of
Flanders
's
present
,
to
whom
Flanders
,
it
be
rumour
,
have
leave
nineteen
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
He
drink
all
the
tea
that
be
offer
him
,
this
nephew
---
amount
,
I
should
say
,
to
several
quart
---
and
eat
as
much
plum
-
cake
as
he
could
possibly
come
by
;
but
he
feel
it
to
be
decent
mourning
that
he
should
now
and
then
stop
in
the
midst
of
a
lump
of
cake
,
and
appear
to
forget
that
his
mouth
be
full
,
in
the
contemplation
of
his
uncle
's
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
all
this
to
be
the
fault
of
the
undertaker
,
who
be
hand
us
glove
on
a
tea
-
tray
as
if
they
be
muffin
,
and
tie
us
into
cloak
<EOS>
(
mine
have
to
be
pin
up
all
round
,
it
be
so
long
for
me
)
,
because
I
know
that
he
be
make
game
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
we
get
out
into
the
street
,
and
I
constantly
disarrange
the
procession
by
tumble
on
the
people
before
me
because
my
handkerchief
blind
my
eye
,
and
trip
up
the
people
behind
me
because
my
cloak
be
so
long
,
I
feel
that
we
be
all
make
game
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
truly
sorry
for
flander
,
but
I
know
that
it
be
no
reason
why
we
should
be
try
(
the
woman
with
their
head
in
hood
like
coal
-
scuttle
with
the
black
side
outward
)
to
keep
step
with
a
man
in
a
scarf
,
carry
a
thing
like
a
mourn
spy
-
glass
,
which
he
be
go
to
open
presently
and
sweep
the
horizon
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
we
should
not
all
have
be
speak
in
one
particular
key
-
note
strike
by
the
undertaker
,
if
we
have
not
be
make
game
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
our
face
we
be
every
one
of
us
as
like
the
undertaker
as
if
we
have
be
his
own
family
,
and
I
perceive
that
this
could
not
have
happen
unless
we
have
be
make
game
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
return
to
Sally
's
,
it
be
all
of
a
piece
.
<EOS>
the
continued
impossibility
of
get
on
without
plum
-
cake
;
the
ceremonious
apparition
of
a
pair
of
decanter
contain
port
and
sherry
and
cork
;
Sally
's
sister
at
the
tea

table
,
clink
the
good
crockery
and
shake
her
head
mournfully
every
time
she
look
down
into
the
teapot
,
as
if
it
be
the
tomb
;
the
Coat
of
arm
again
,
and
Sally
as
before
;
lastly
,
the
word
of
consolation
administer
to
Sally
when
it
be
consider
right
that
she
should
"
come
round
nicely
:
"

<EOS>
other
funeral
have
I
see
with
grow

up
eye
,
since
that
day
,
of
which
the
burden
have
be
the
same
childish
burden
.
 
<EOS>
make
game
.
<EOS>
real
affliction
,
real
grief
and
solemnity
,
have
be
outrage
,
and
the
funeral
have
be
"
perform
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
waste
for
which
the
funeral
custom
of
many
tribe
of
savage
be
conspicuous
,
have
attend
these
civilised
obsequie
;
and
once
,
and
twice
,
have
I
wish
in
my
soul
that
if
the
waste
must
be
,
they
would
let
the
undertaker
bury
the
money
,
and
let
me
bury
the
friend
.
   
<EOS>
in
France
,
upon
the
whole
,
these
ceremony
be
more
sensibly
regulate
,
because
they
be
upon
the
whole
less
expensively
regulate
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
ever
be
much
edify
by
the
custom
of
tie
a
bib
and
apron
on
the
front
of
the
house
of
mourning
,
or
that
I
would
myself
particularly
care
to
be
drive
to
my
grave
in
a
nodding
and
bobbing
car
,
like
an
infirm
four
-
post
bedstead
,
by
an
inky
fellow
-
creature
in
a
cock
-
hat
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
that
I
be
constitutionally
insensible
to
the
virtue
of
a
cock
-
hat
.
 
<EOS>
in
provincial
France
,
the
solemnity
be
sufficiently
hideous
,
but
be
few
and
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
the
friend
and
townsman
of
the
depart
,
in
their
own
dress
and
not
masquerade
under
the
auspex
of
the
African
Conjurer
,
surround
the
hand
-
bi
,
and
often
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
consider
indispensable
to
stifle
the
bearer
,
or
even
to
elevate
the
burden
on
their
shoulder
;
consequently
it
be
easily
take
up
,
and
easily
set
down
,
and
be
carry
through
the
street
without
the
distress
flounder
and
shuffling
that
we
see
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
a
dirty
priest
or
two
,
and
a
dirty
acolyte
or
two
,
do
not
lend
any
especial
grace
to
the
proceeding
;
and
I
regard
with
personal
animosity
the
bassoon
,
which
be
blow
at
interval
by
the
big
-
legged
priest
(
it
be
always
a
big
-
legged
priest
who
blow
the
bassoon
)
,
when
his
fellow
combine
in
a
lugubrious
stalwart
drawl
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
far
less
of
the
Conjurer
and
the
Medicine
Man
in
the
business
than
under
like
circumstance
here
.
 
<EOS>
the
grim
coach
that
we
reserve
expressly
for
such
show
,
be
non
-
existent
;
if
the
cemetery
be
far
out
of
the
town
,
the
coach
that
be
hire
for
other
purpose
of
life
be
hire
for
this
purpose
;
and
although
the
honest
vehicle
make
no
pretence
of
be
overcome
,
I
have
never
notice
that
the
people
in
them
be
the
bad
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
Italy
,
the
hooded
member
of
confraternitie
who
attend
on
funeral
,
be
dismal
and
ugly
to
look
upon
;
but
the
service
they
render
be
at
least
voluntarily
render
,
and
impoverish
no
one
,
and
cost
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
high
civilisation
and
low
savagery
ever
come
together
on
the
point
of
make
them
a
wantonly
wasteful
and
contemptible
set
of
form
?
   
<EOS>
once
I
lose
a
friend
by
death
,
who
have
be
trouble
in
his
time
by
the
Medicine
Man
and
the
Conjurer
,
and
upon
whose
limited
resource
there
be
abundant
claim
.
 
<EOS>
the
Conjurer
assure
me
that
I
must
positively
"
follow
,
"
and
both
he
and
the
Medicine
Man
entertain
no
doubt
that
I
must
go
in
a
black
carriage
,
and
must
wear
"
fitting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
object
to
fitting
as
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
friendship
,
and
I
object
to
the
black
carriage
as
be
in
more
sense
than
one
a
job
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
it
come
into
my
mind
to
try
what
would
happen
if
I
quietly
walk
,
in
my
own
way
,
from
my
own
house
to
my
friend
's
burial
-
place
,
and
stand
beside
his
open
grave
in
my
own
dress
and
person
,
reverently
listen
to
the
good
of
Services
.
 
<EOS>
It
satisfy
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
quite
as
well
as
if
I
have
be
disguise
in
a
hire
hatband
and
scarf
<EOS>
both
trail
to
my
very
heel
,
and
as
if
I
have
cost
the
orphan
child
,
in
their
great
need
,
ten
guinea
.
   
<EOS>
Can
any
one
who
ever
beheld
the
stupendous
absurdity
attendant
on
"
a
message
from
the
Lords
"
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
turn
upon
the
Medicine
Man
of
the
poor
Indians
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
any
"
Medicine
"
in
that
dry
skin
pouch
of
his
,
so
supremely
ludicrous
as
the
two
Masters
in
chancery
hold
up
their
black
petticoat
and
butt
their
ridiculous
wig
at
Mr
Speaker
?
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
authority
innumerable
to
tell
me
---
as
there
be
authority
innumerable
among
the
Indians
to
tell
them
---
that
the
nonsense
be
indispensable
,
and
that
its
abrogation
would
involve
most
awful
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
what
would
any
rational
creature
who
have
never
hear
of
judicial
and
forensic
"
fitting
,
"
think
of
the
Court
of
Common
Pleas
on
the
first
day
of
Term
?
 
<EOS>
or
with
what
an
awakened
sense
of
humour
would
LIVINGSTONE
's
account
of
a
similar
scene
be
peruse
,
if
the
fur
and
red
cloth
and
goat
'
hair
and
horse
hair
and
powder
chalk
and
black
patch
on
the
top
of
the
head
,
be
all
at
Tala
Mungongo
instead
of
Westminster
?
 
<EOS>
that
model
missionary
and
good
brave
man
find
at
least
one
tribe
of
black
with
a
very
strong
sense
of
the
ridiculous
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
although
an
amiable
and
docile
people
,
they
never
could
see
the
Missionaries
dispose
of
their
leg
in
the
attitude
of
kneel
,
or
hear
them
begin
a
hymn
in
chorus
,
without
burst
into
roar
of
irrepressible
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
much
to
be
hope
that
no
member
of
this
facetious
tribe
may
ever
find
his
way
to
England
and
get
commit
for
contempt
of
Court
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
Tonga
Island
already
mention
,
there
be
a
set
of
personage
call
Mataboos
---
or
some
such
name
---
who
be
the
master
of
all
the
public
ceremony
,
and
who
know
the
exact
place
in
which
every
chief
must
sit
down
when
a
solemn
public
meeting
take
place
:
 
a
meeting
which
bear
a
family
resemblance
to
our
own
Public
Dinner
,
in
respect
of
its
be
a
main
part
of
the
proceeding
that
every
gentleman
present
be
require
to
drink
something
nasty
.
 
<EOS>
these
Mataboos
be
a
privileged
order
,
so
important
be
their
avocation
,
and
they
make
the
most
of
their
high
function
.
 
<EOS>
a
long
way
out
of
the
Tonga
Islands
,
indeed
,
rather
near
the
British
Islands
,
be
there
no
calling
in
of
the
Mataboos
the
other
day
to
settle
an
earth
-
convulse
question
of
precedence
;
and
be
there
no
weighty
opinion
deliver
on
the
part
of
the
Mataboos
which
,
be
interpret
to
that
unlucky
tribe
of
black
with
the
sense
of
the
ridiculous
,
would
infallibly
set
the
whole
population
scream
with
laughter
?
   
<EOS>
My
sense
of
justice
demand
the
admission
,
however
,
that
this
be
not
quite
a
one
-
sided
question
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
submit
ourselves
meekly
to
the
Medicine
Man
and
the
Conjurer
,
and
be
not
exalt
by
it
,
the
savage
may
retort
upon
us
that
we
act
more
unwisely
than
they
in
other
matter
wherein
we
fail
to
imitate
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
widely
diffuse
custom
among
savage
tribe
,
when
they
meet
to
discuss
any
affair
of
public
importance
,
to
sit
up
all
night
make
a
horrible
noise
,
dancing
,
blow
shell
,
and
(
in
case
where
they
be
familiar
with
fire
-
arm
)
fly
out
into
open
place
and
let
off
gun
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
questionable
whether
our
legislative
assembly
may
not
take
a
hint
from
this
.
 
<EOS>
a
shell
be
not
a
melodious
wind
-
instrument
,
and
it
be
monotonous
;
but
it
be
as
musical
as
,
and
not
more
monotonous
than
,
my
honourable
friend
's
own
trumpet
,
or
the
trumpet
that
he
blow
so
hard
for
the

<EOS>
the
uselessness
of
argue
with
any
supporter
of
a
Government
or
of
an
opposition
,
be
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
try
dancing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
well
exercise
,
and
have
the
unspeakable
recommendation
that
it
could
not
be
report
.
 
<EOS>
the
honourable
and
savage
member
who
have
a
load
gun
,
and
have
grow
impatient
of
debate
,
plunge
out
of
door
,
fire
in
the
air
,
and
return
calm
and
silent
to
the
Palaver
.
 
<EOS>
let
the
honourable
and
civilised
member
similarly
charge
with
a
speech
,
dart
into
the
cloister
of
Westminster
Abbey
in
the
silence
of
night
,
let
his
speech
off
,
and
come
back
harmless
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
at
first
sight
a
very
rational
custom
to
paint
a
broad
blue
stripe
across
one
's
nose
and
both
cheek
,
and
a
broad
red
stripe
from
the
forehead
to
the
chin
,
to
attach
a
few
pound
of
wood
to
one
's
under
lip
,
to
stick
fish
-
bone
in
one
's
ear
and
a
brass
curtain
-
ring
in
one
's
nose
,
and
to
rub
one
's
body
all
over
with
rancid
oil
,
as
a
preliminary
to
enter
on
business
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
question
of
taste
and
ceremony
,
and
so
be
the
Windsor
Uniform
.
 
<EOS>
the
manner
of
enter
on
the
business
itself
be
another
question
.
 
<EOS>
a
council
of
six
hundred
savage
gentleman
entirely
independent
of
tailor
,
sit
on
their
ham
in
a
ring
,
smoking
,
and
occasionally
grunt
,
seem
to
me
,
accord
to
the
experience
I
have
gather
in
my
voyage
and
travel
,
somehow
to
do
what
they
come
together
for
;
whereas
that
be
not
at
all
the
general
experience
of
a
council
of
six
hundred
civilised
gentleman
very
dependent
on
tailor
and
sit
on
mechanical
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
an
Assembly
should
do
its
utmost
to
envelop
itself
in
smoke
,
than
that
it
should
direct
its
endeavour
to
envelop
the
public
in
smoke
;
and
I
would
rather
it
bury
half
a
hundred
hatchet
than
bury
one

attention

<EOS>
by
the

of
most
railway
out
of
London
,
one
may
see
Alms
-
Houses
and
Retreats
(
generally
with
a
wing
or
a
Centre
wanting
,
and
ambitious
of
be
much
big
than
they
be
)
,
some
of
which
be
newly
-
found
Institutions
,
and
some
old
establishment
transplant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
tendency
in
these
piece
of
architecture
to
shoot
upward
unexpectedly
,
like
Jack
's
bean
-
stalk
,
and
to
be
ornate
in
spire
of
Chapels
and
lantern
of
hall
,
which
may
lead
to
the
embellishment
of
the
air
with
many
castle
of
questionable
beauty
but
for
the
restrain
consideration
of
expense
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
manner
,
be
always
of
a
sanguine
temperament
,
comfort
themselves
with
plan
and
elevation
of
Loomings
in
the
future
,
and
be
influence
in
the
present
by
philanthropy
towards
the
railway
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
the
question
how
prosperous
and
promise
the
building
can
be
make
to
look
in
their
eye
,
usually
supersede
the
less
question
how
they
can
be
turn
to
the
good
account
for
the
inmate
.
   
<EOS>
why
none
of
the
people
who
reside
in
these
place
ever
look
out
of
window
,
or
take
an
airing
in
the
piece
of
ground
which
be
go
to
be
a
garden
by
-
and
-
by
,
be
one
of
the
wonder
I
have
add
to
my
always
-
lengthen
list
of
the
wonder
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
it
into
my
mind
that
they
live
in
a
state
of
chronic
injury
and
resentment
,
and
on
that
account
refuse
to
decorate
the
building
with
a
human
interest
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
know
legatee
deeply
injure
by
a
bequest
of
five
hundred
pound
because
it
be
not
five
thousand
,
and
as
I
be
once
acquaint
with
a
pensioner
on
the
public
to
the
extent
of
two
hundred
a
year
,
who
perpetually
anathematise
his
Country
because
he
be
not
in
the
receipt
of
four
,
have
no
claim
whatever
to
sixpence
:
 
<EOS>
so
perhaps
it
usually
happen
,
within
certain
limit
,
that
to
get
a
little
help
be
to
get
a
notion
of
be
defraud
of
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
they
pass
their
life
in
this
beautiful
and
peaceful
place
!
"
<EOS>
be
the
subject
of
my
speculation
with
a
visitor
who
once
accompany
me
to
a
charming
rustic
retreat
for
old
man
and
woman
:
 
a
quaint
ancient
foundation
in
a
pleasant
english
country
,
behind
a
picturesque
church
and
among
rich
old
convent
garden
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
some
dozen
or
so
of
house
,
and
we
agree
that
we
would
talk
with
the
inhabitant
,
as
they
sit
in
their
groin
room
between
the
light
of
their
fire
and
the
light
shine
in
at
their
lattice
window
,
and
would
find
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
pass
their
life
in
consider
themselves
mulct
of
certain
ounce
of
tea
by
a
deaf
old
steward
who
live
among
them
in
the
quadrangle
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
such
ounce
of
tea
have
ever
be
in
existence
,
or
that
the
old
steward
so
much
as
know
what
be
the
matter
;
---
he
pass
his
life
in
consider
himself
periodically
defraud
of
a
birch
-
broom
by
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
but
it
be
neither
to
old
Alms
-
Houses
in
the
country
,
nor
to
new
Alms
-
Houses
by
the
railroad
,
that
these
present
uncommercial
note
relate
.
 
<EOS>
They
refer
back
to
journey
make
among
those
common

place
,
smoky

London
Alms

Houses
,
with
a
little

as
it

;
which
be
once
in
a
suburb
,
but
be
now
in
the
densely
populated
town
;
gap
in
the
busy

around
them
,
parenthesis
in

<EOS>
sometimes
,
these

belong
to
a

<EOS>
sometimes
,
they
be
establish
by
individual
,
and
be
maintain
out
of
private

bequeath
in

long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
My
favourite
among
them
be
Titbull
's
,
which
establishment
be
a
picture
of
many
.
 
<EOS>
of
Titbull
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
than
that
he
decease
in
1723
,
that
his
christian
name
be
Sampson
,
and
his
social
designation
Esquire
,
and
that
he
found
these
Alms

Houses
as
dwelling
for
Nine
Poor
Women
and
six
poor
Men
by
his
Will
and
Testament
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
know
even
this
much
,
but
for
its
be
inscribe

a
grim

very
difficult
to

,
let
into
the

of
the

of
Titbull

piece

<EOS>
Titbull

be
in
the

,
in

in

so
do
I
first

Titbull

just
inside
the

have
a
conceited

"
 
<EOS>
this
old

such

we

Hogarth

it

of

peculiar
green

pea
hue
without

It

also
that

I.
   
<EOS>
"

It

masticate
his
anger

to
find
that
it

<EOS>
not

the

give
it
another
virulent
look

take
up
his

and
carry
it
into
a
corner
dwelling

house

shut
the

<EOS>
look
around

Mr

for
Mr

Mrs
Saggers
be
very
hard
upon
them

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Saggers
be
the
old
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
old
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Quinch
be
the
old
,
and
have
totally
lose
her
head

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
young
in
residence
,
and
consequently
be
not
look
up
to

<EOS>
but
when
Mrs
Quinch
make
a
happy
release
,
there
will
be
one
below
me

<EOS>
nor
be
it
to
be
expect
that
Mrs

will
prove
herself
immortal

my

slightingly

they

<EOS>
They
do
not
count
among

<EOS>
Mr
Battens
be
that
exceptional
that
he
have
write
to
the
gentleman
many
time
and
have
work
the
case
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
have
take
a
high
ground
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
do
not
,
as
a
rule
,
greatly
reckon
the
old
gentleman
.
"
   
<EOS>
pursue
the
subject
,
I
find
it
to
be
traditionally
settle
among
the
poor
lady
that
the
poor
gentleman
,
whatever
their
age
,
be
all
very
old
indeed
,
and
in
a
state
of
dotage
.
 
<EOS>
I
also
discover
that
the
junior
and
newcomer
preserve
,
for
a
time
,
a
wane
disposition
to
believe
in
Titbull
and
his
trustee
,
but
that
as
they
gain
social
standing
they
lose
this
faith
,
and
disparage
Titbull
and
all
his
work
.
   
<EOS>
improve
my
acquaintance
subsequently
with
this
respected
lady
,
whose
name
be
Mrs
Mitts
,
and
occasionally
drop
in
upon
her
with
a
little
offering
of
sound
Family
Hyson
in
my
pocket
,
I
gradually
become
familiar
with
the
inner
politic
and
way
of
Titbull
's
Alms
-
Houses
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
could
find
out
who
the
trustee
be
,
or
where
they
be
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
one
of
the
fix
idea
of
the
place
that
those
authority
must
be
vaguely
and
mysteriously
mention
as
"
the
gentleman
"
only
.
 
<EOS>
the
secretary
of
"
the
gentleman
"
be
once
point
out
to
me
,
evidently
engage
in
champion
the
obnoxious
pump
against
the
attack
of
the
discontent
Mr
Battens
;
but
I
be
not
in
a
condition
to
report
further
of
him
than
that
he
have
the
sprightly
bearing
of
a
lawyer
's
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
from
Mrs
Mitts
's
lip
in
a
very
confidential
moment
,
that
Mr
Battens
be
once
"
have
up
before
the
gentleman
"
to
stand
or
fall
by
his
accusation
,
and
that
an
old
shoe
be
throw
after
him
on
his
departure
from
the
building
on
this
dread
errand
;
---
not
ineffectually
,
for
,
the
interview
result
in
a
plumber
,
be
consider
to
have
encircle
the
temple
of
Mr
Battens
with
the
wreath
of
victory
,
   
<EOS>
in
Titbull
's
Alms
-
Houses
,
the
local
society
be
not
regard
as
good
society
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
or
lady
receive
visitor
from
without
,
or
go
out
to
tea
,
count
,
as
it
be
,
accordingly
;
but
visiting
or
tea
-
drinking
interchange
among
Titbullians
do
not
score
.
 
<EOS>
such
interchange
,
however
,
be
rare
,
in
consequence
of
internal
dissension
occasion
by
Mrs
Saggers
's
pail
:
 
which
household
article
have
split
Titbull
's
into
almost
as
many
party
as
there
be
dwelling
in
that
precinct
.
 
<EOS>
the
extremely
complicated
nature
of
the
conflict
article
of
belief
on
the
subject
prevent
my
state
them
here
with
my
usual
perspicuity
,
but
I
think
they
have
all
branch
off
from
the
root
-
and
-
trunk
question
,
have
Mrs
Saggers
any
right
to
stand
her
pail
outside
her
dwelling
?
 
<EOS>
the
question
have
be
much
refine
upon
,
but
roughly
state
may
be
state
in
those
term
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
two
old
man
in
Titbull
's
Alms
-
Houses
who
,
I
have
be
give
to
understand
,
know
each
other
in
the
world
beyond
its
pump
and
iron
railing
,
when
they
be
both
"
in
trade
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
make
the
good
of
their
reverse
,
and
be
look
upon
with
great
contempt
.
<EOS>
They
be
little
,
stoop
,
blear
-
eyed
old
man
of
cheerful
countenance
,
and
they
hobble
up
and
down
the
court
-
yard
wag
their
chin
and
talk
together
quite
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
give
offence
,
and
have
,
moreover
,
raise
the
question
whether
they
be
justified
in
pass
any
other
window
than
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Battens
,
however
,
permit
them
to
pass
his
window
,
on
the
disdainful
ground
that
their
imbecility
almost
amount
to
irresponsibility
,
they
be
allow
to
take
their
walk
in
peace
.
<EOS>
They
live
next
door
to
one
another
,
and
take
it
by
turn
to
read
the
newspaper
aloud
(
that
be
to
say
,
the
new
newspaper
they
can
get
)
,
and
they
play
cribbage
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
on
warm
and
sunny
day
they
have
be
know
to
go
so
far
as
to
bring
out
two
chair
and
sit
by
the
iron
railing
,
look
forth
;
but
this
low
conduct
,
be
much
remark
upon
throughout
Titbull
's
,
they
be
deter
by
an
outraged
public
opinion
from
repeat
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
rumour
---
but
it
may
be
malicious
---
that
they
hold
the
memory
of
Titbull
in
some
weak
sort
of
veneration
,
and
that
they
once
set
off
together
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
parish
churchyard
to
find
his
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
perhaps
,
may
be
trace
a
general
suspicion
that
they
be
spy
of
"
the
gentleman
:
"
to
which
they
be
suppose
to
have
give
colour
in
my
own
presence
on
the
occasion
of
the
weak
attempt
at
justification
of
the
pump
by
the
gentleman
's
clerk
;
when
they
emerge
bare
-
head
from
the
door
of
their
dwelling
,
as
if
their
dwelling
and
themselves
constitute
an
old
-
fashioned
weather
-
glass
of
double
action
with
two
figure
of
old
lady
inside
,
and
deferentially
bow
to
him
at
interval
until
he
take
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
understand
to
be
perfectly
friendless
and
relationless
.
 
<EOS>
unquestionably
the
two
poor
fellow
make
the
very
good
of
their
life
in
Titbull
's
Alms
-
Houses
,
and
unquestionably
they
be
(
as
before
mention
)
<EOS>
the
subject
of
unmitigated
contempt
there
.
   
<EOS>
on
Saturday
night
,
when
there
be
a
great
stir
than
usual
outside
,
and
when
itinerant
vendor
of
miscellaneous
ware
even
take
their
station
and
light
up
their
smoky
lamp
before
the
iron
railing
,
Titbull
's
become
flurried
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Saggers
have
her
celebrated
palpitation
of
the
heart
,
for
the
most
part
,
on
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
Titbull
's
be
unfit
to
strive
with
the
uproar
of
the
street
in
any
of
its
phase
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
religiously
believe
at
Titbull
's
that
people
push
more
than
they
use
,
and
likewise
that
the
foremost
object
of
the
population
of
England
and
Wales
be
to
get
you
down
and
trample
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
even
of
railroad
<EOS>
they
know
,
at
Titbull
's
,
little
more
than
the
shriek
(
which
Mrs
Saggers
say
go
through
her
,
and
ought
to
be
take
up
by
Government
)
;
and
the
penny
postage
may
even
yet
be
unknown
there
,
for
I
have
never
see
a
letter
deliver
to
any
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
tall
,
straight
,
sallow
lady
resident
in
Number
Seven
,
Titbull
's
,
who
never
speak
to
anybody
,
who
be
surround
by
a
superstitious
halo
of
lose
wealth
,
who
do
her
household
work
in
housemaid
's
glove
,
and
who
be
secretly
much
defer
to
,
though
openly
cavil
at
;
and
it
have
obscurely
leak
out
that
this
old
lady
have
a
son
,
grandson
,
nephew
,
or
other
relative
,
who
be
"
a
Contractor
,
"
and
who
would
think
it
nothing
of
a
job
to
knock
down
Titbull
's
,
pack
it
off
into
Cornwall
,
and
knock
it
together
again
.
 
<EOS>
an
immense
sensation
be
make
by
a
gipsy
-
party
calling
in
a
spring
-
van
,
to
take
this
old
lady
up
to
go
for
a
day
's
pleasure
into
Epping
Forest
,
and
note
be
compare
as
to
which
of
the
company
be
the
son
,
grandson
,
nephew
,
or
other
relative
,
the
Contractor
.
 
<EOS>
a
thick
-
set
personage
with
a
white
hat
and
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
be
the
favourite
:
 
though
as
Titbull
's
have
no
other
reason
to
believe
that
the
Contractor
be
there
at
all
,
than
that
this
man
be
suppose
to
eye
the
chimney
stack
as
if
he
would
like
to
knock
them
down
and
cart
them
off
,
the
general
mind
be
much
unsettle
in
arrive
at
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
way
out
of
this
difficulty
,
it
concentrate
itself
on
the
acknowledge
Beauty
of
the
party
,
every
stitch
in
whose
dress
be
verbally
unrip
by
the
old
lady
then
and
there
,
and
whose
"
going
on
"
with
another
and
a
thin
personage
in
a
white
hat
may
have
suffuse
the
pump
(
where
they
be
principally
discuss
)
with
blush
,
for
month
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Herein
Titbull
's
be
to
Titbull
's
true
,
for
it
have
a
constitutional
dislike
of
all
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
as
concern
innovation
and
improvement
,
it
be
always
of
opinion
that
what
it
do
not
want
itself
,
nobody
ought
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
have
meet
with
this
opinion
outside
Titbull
's
.
   
<EOS>
of
the
humble
treasure
of
furniture
bring
into
Titbull
's
by
the
inmate
when
they
establish
themselves
in
that
place
of
contemplation
for
the
rest
of
their
day
,
by
far
the
great
and
more
valuable
part
belong
to
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
claim
the
honour
of
have
either
cross
the
threshold
,
or
look
in
at
the
door
,
of
every
one
of
the
nine
lady
,
and
I
have
notice
that
they
be
all
particular
in
the
article
of
bedstead
,
and
maintain
favourite
and
long
-
establish
bedstead
and
bed
as
a
regular
part
of
their
rest
.
 
<EOS>
generally
an
antiquated
chest
of
drawer
be
among
their
cherished
possession
;
a
tea
-
tray
always
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
of
at
least
two
room
in
which
a
little
tea
-
kettle
of
genuine
burnished
copper
,
vie
with
the
cat
in
wink
at
the
fire
;
and
one
old
lady
have
a
tea
-
urn
set
forth
in
state
on
the
top
of
her
chest
of
drawer
,
which
urn
be
use
as
her
library
,
and
contain
four
duodecimo
volume
,
and
a
black
-
border
newspaper
give
an
account
of
the
funeral
of
Her
Royal
Highness
the
Princess
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
poor
old
gentleman
there
be
no
such
nicety
.
 
<EOS>
Their
furniture
have
the
air
of
be
contribute
,
like
some
obsolete
Literary
Miscellany
,
"
by
several
hand
;
"
their
few
chair
never
match
;
old
patchwork
coverlet
linger
among
them
;
and
they
have
an
untidy
habit
of
keep
their
wardrobe
in
hat
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
recall
one
old
gentleman
who
be
rather
choice
in
his
shoe
-
brush
and
blacking
-
bottle
,
I
have
sum
up
the
domestic
elegance
of
that
side
of
the
building
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
occurrence
of
a
death
in
Titbull
's
,
it
be
invariably
agree
among
the
survivor
---
and
it
be
the
only
subject
on
which
they
do
agree
---
that
the
depart
do
something
"
to
bring
it
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
judge
by
Titbull
's
,
I
should
say
the
human
race
nee
never
die
,
if
they
take
care
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
do
not
take
care
,
and
they
do
die
,
and
when
they
die
in
Titbull
's
they
be
bury
at
the
cost
of
the
Foundation
.
 
<EOS>
some
provision
have
be
make
for
the
purpose
,
in
virtue
of
which
(
I
record
this
on
the
strength
of
have
see
the
funeral
of
Mrs
Quinch
)
a
lively
neighbouring
undertaker
dress
up
four
of
the
old
man
,
and
four
of
the
old
woman
,
hustle
them
into
a
procession
of
four
couple
,
and
lead
off
with
a
large
black
bow
at
the
back
of
his
hat
,
look
over
his
shoulder
at
them
airily
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
no
member
of
the
party
have
get
lose
,
or
have
tumble
down
;
as
if
they
be
a
company
of
dim
old
doll
.
   
<EOS>
resignation
of
a
dwelling
be
of
very
rare
occurrence
in
Titbull
's
.
<EOS>
a
story
do
obtain
there
,
how
an
old
lady
's
son
once
draw
a
prize
of
Thirty
Thousand
Pounds
in
the
Lottery
,
and
presently
drive
to
the
gate
in
his
own
carriage
,
with
french
horn
play
up
behind
,
and
whisk
his
mother
away
,
and
leave
ten
guinea
for
a
Feast
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
unable
to
substantiate
it
by
any
evidence
,
and
regard
it
as
an
Alms
-
House
Fairy
Tale
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
the
only
proved
case
of
resignation
happen
within
my
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen
on
this
wise
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sharp
competition
among
the
lady
respect
the
gentility
of
their
visitor
,
and
I
have
so
often
observe
visitor
to
be
dress
as
for
a
holiday
occasion
,
that
I
suppose
the
lady
to
have
beseech
them
to
make
all
possible
display
when
they
come
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
circumstance
much
excitement
be
one
day
occasion
by
Mrs
Mitts
receive
a
visit
from
a
Greenwich
Pensioner
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
pensioner
of
a
bluff
and
warlike
appearance
,
with
an
empty
coat
-
sleeve
,
and
he
be
get
up
with
unusual
care
<EOS>
;
his
coat
-
button
be
extremely
bright
,
he
wear
his
empty
coat
-
sleeve
in
a
graceful
festoon
,
and
he
have
a
walking
-
stick
in
his
hand
that
must
have
cost
money
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
with
the
head
of
his
walking
-
stick
,
he
knock
at
Mrs
Mitts
's
door
---
there
be
no
knocker
in
Titbull
's
---
<EOS>
Mrs
Mitts
be
overhear
by
a
next
-
door
neighbour
to
utter
a
cry
of
surprise
express
much
agitation
;
and
the
same
neighbour
do
afterwards
solemnly
affirm
that
when
he
be
admit
into
Mrs
Mitts
's
room
,
she
hear
a
smack
.
 
<EOS>
hear
a
smack
which
be
not
a
blow
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
about
this
Greenwich
Pensioner
when
he
take
his
departure
,
which
imbue
all
Titbull
's
with
the
conviction

<EOS>
He
be
eagerly
look
for
,
and
Mrs
Mitts
be
closely
watch
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
if
anything
could
have
place
the
unfortunate
six
old
gentleman
at
a
great
disadvantage
than
that
at
which
they
chronically
stand
,
it
would
have
be
the
apparition
of
this
Greenwich
Pensioner
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
well
shrink
already
,
but
they
shrink
to
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
Pensioner
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
poor
old
gentleman
themselves
seem
conscious
of
their
inferiority
,
and
to
know
submissively
that
they
could
never
hope
to
hold
their
own
against
the
pensioner
with
his
warlike
and
maritime
experience
in
the
past
,
and
his
tobacco
money
in
the
present
:
 
his
chequered
career
of
blue
water
,
black
gunpowder
,
and
red
bloodshed
for
England
,
home
,
and
beauty
.
   
<EOS>
before
three
week
be
out
,
the
pensioner
reappear
.
 
<EOS>
again
he
knock
at
Mrs
Mitts
's
door
with
the
handle
of
his
stick
,
and
again
be
he
admit
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
again
do
he
depart
alone
;
for
Mrs
Mitts
,
in
a
bonnet
identify
as
have
be
re
-
embellished
,
go
out
walk
with
him
,
and
stay
out
till
the
ten
o'clock
beer
,
Greenwich
time
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
truce
,
even
as
to
the
troubled
water
of
Mrs
Saggers
's
pail
;
nothing
be
speak
of
among
the
lady
but
the
conduct
of
Mrs
Mitts
and
its
blighting
influence
on
the
reputation
of
Titbull
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
Mr
Battens
"
ought
to
take
it
up
,
"
and
Mr
Battens
be
communicate
with
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
that
unsatisfactory
individual
reply
"
that
he
do
not
see
his
way
yet
,
"
and
it
be
unanimously
vote
by
the
lady
that
aggravation
be
in
his
nature
.
   
<EOS>
how
it
come
to
pass
,
with
some
appearance
of
inconsistency
,
that
Mrs
Mitts
be
cut
by
all
the
lady
and
the
pensioner
admire
by
all
the
lady
,
matter
not
.
 
<EOS>
before
another
week
be
out
,
Titbull
's
be
startle
by
another
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
appear
a
cab
,
contain
not
only
the
Greenwich
Pensioner
with
one
arm
,
but
,
to
boot
,
a
Chelsea
pensioner
with
one
leg
.
 
<EOS>
both
dismount
to
assist
Mrs
Mitts
into
the
cab
,
the
Greenwich
Pensioner
bear
her
company
inside
,
and
the
Chelsea
Pensioner
mount
the
box
by
the
driver
:
 
his
wooden
leg
stick
out
after
the
manner
of
a
bowsprit
,
as
if
in
jocular
homage
to
his
friend
's
sea
-
go
career
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
equipage
drive
away
.
 
<EOS>
no
Mrs
Mitts
return
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
what
Mr
Battens
may
have
do
in
the
matter
of
take
it
up
,
goad
by
the
infuriate
state
of
public
feeling
next
morning
,
be
anticipate
by
another
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
a
Truck
,
propel
by
the
Greenwich
Pensioner
and
the
Chelsea
Pensioner
,
each
placidly
smoke
a
pipe
,
and
push
his
warrior
breast
against
the
handle
.
   
<EOS>
the
display
on
the
part
of
the
Greenwich
Pensioner
of
his
"
marriage
-
line
,
"
and
his
announcement
that
himself
and
friend
have
look
in
for
the
furniture
of
Mrs
G
Pensioner
,
late
Mitts
,
by
no
means
reconcile
the
lady
to
the
conduct
of
their
sister
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
say
that
they
appear
more
than
ever
exasperate
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
my
stray
visit
to
Titbull
's
since
the
date
of
this
occurrence
,
have
confirm
me
in
an
impression
that
it
be
a
wholesome
fillip
.
 
<EOS>
the
nine
lady
be
smart
,
both
in
mind
and
dress
,
than
they
use
to
be
,
though
it
must
be
admit
that
they
despise
the
six
gentleman
to
the
last
extent
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
much
great
interest
in
the
external
thoroughfare
too
,
than
they
have
when
I
first
know
Titbull
's
.
 
<EOS>
and
whenever
I
chance
to
be
lean
my
back
against
the
pump
or
the
iron
railing
,
and
to
be
talk
to
one
of
the
junior
lady
,
and
to
see
that
a
flush
have
pass
over
her
face
,
I
immediately
know
without
look
round
that
a
Greenwich
Pensioner
have
go
past
.
    
<EOS>
Number
29
:
<EOS>
the
Ruffian
 
<EOS>
I
entertain
so
strong
an
objection
to
the
euphonious
softening
of
Ruffian
into
Rough
,
which
have
lately
become
popular
,
that
I
restore
the
right
word
to
the
heading
of
this
paper
;
the
rather
,
as
my
object
be
to
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
the
Ruffian
be
tolerate
among
us
to
an
extent
that
go
beyond
all
unruffianly
endurance
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
to
believe
that
if
the
ruffian
beset
my
life
,
a
professional
Ruffian
at
large
in
the
open
street
of
a
great
city
,
notoriously
have
no
other
calling
than
that
of
Ruffian
,
and
of
disquiet
and
despoil
me
as
I
go
peacefully
about
my
lawful
business
,
interfere
with
no
one
,
then
the
Government
under
which
I
have
the
great
constitutional
privilege
,
supreme
honour
and
happiness
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
to
exist
,
break
down
in
the
discharge
of
any
Government
's
most
simple
elementary
duty
.
   
<EOS>
what
do
I
read
in
the
London
daily
paper
,
in
the
early
day
of
this
last
September
?
 
<EOS>
that
the
Police
have
"
at
LENGTH
SUCCEEDED
in
CAPTURING
two
of
the
NOTORIOUS
GANG
that
have
<EOS>
so
long
invest
<EOS>
the
WATERLOO
road
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
?
 
<EOS>
what
a
wonderful
police
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
straight
,
broad
,
public
thoroughfare
of
immense
resort
;
half
a
mile
long
;
gas
-
light
by
night
;
with
a
great
gas
-
light
railway
station
in
it
,
extra
the
street
lamp
;
full
of
shop
;
traverse
by
two
popular
cross
thoroughfare
of
considerable
traffic
;
itself
the
main
road
to
the
South
of
London
;
and
the
admirable
Police
have
,
after
long
infestment
of
this
dark
and
lonely
spot
by
a
gang
of
Ruffians
,
actually
get
hold
of
two
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
can
it
be
doubt
that
any
man
of
fair
London
knowledge
and
common
resolution
,
arm
with
the
power
of
the
Law
,
could
have
capture
the
whole
confederacy
in
a
week
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
to
the
saving
up
of
the
ruffian
class
by
the
Magistracy
and
Police
---
to
the
conventional
preserving
of
them
,
as
if
they
be
partridge
---
that
their
number
and
audacity
must
be
in
great
part
refer
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
a
notorious
Thief
and
Ruffian
ever
leave
at
large
?
<EOS>
He
never
turn
his
liberty
to
any
account
but
violence
and
plunder
,
he
never
do
a
day
's
work
out
of
gaol
,
he
never
will
do
a
day
's
work
out
of
gaol
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
proved
notorious
thief
he
be
always
consignable
to
prison
for
three
month
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
out
,
he
be
surely
as
notorious
a
thief
as
he
be
when
he
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
then
send
him
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
Society
for
the
protection
of
remonstrant
Ruffians
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
equivalent
to
a
sentence
of
perpetual
imprisonment
!
"
 
<EOS>
precisely
for
that
reason
it
have
my
advocacy
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
to
have
the
Ruffian
keep
out
of
my
way
,
and
out
of
the
way
of
all
decent
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
to
have
the
ruffian
employ
,
perforce
,
in
hew
wood
and
drawing
water
somewhere
for
the
general
service
,
instead
of
hew
at
her
Majesty
's
subject
and
draw
their
watch
out
of
their
pocket
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
term
an
unreasonable
demand
,
then
the
tax
-
gatherer
's
demand
on
me
must
be
far
more
unreasonable
,
and
can
not
be
otherwise
than
extortionate
and
unjust
.
   
<EOS>
It
will
be
see
that
I
treat
of
the
Thief
and
Ruffian
as
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
because
I
know
the
two
character
to
be
one
<EOS>
,
in
the
vast
majority
of
case
,
just
as
well
as
the
Police
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
(
as
to
the
Magistracy
,
with
a
few
exception
,
they
know
nothing
about
it
<EOS>
but
what
the
Police
choose
to
tell
them
.
)
 
<EOS>
there
be
disorderly
class
of
man
who
be
not
thief
;
as
railway
-
navigator
,
brickmaker
,
wood
-
sawyer
,
costermonger
.
 
<EOS>
these
class
be
often
disorderly
and
troublesome
;
but
it
be
mostly
among
themselves
,
and
at
any
rate
they
have
their
industrious
avocation
,
they
work
early
and
late
,
and
work
hard
.
 
<EOS>
the
generic
Ruffian
---
honourable
member
for
what
be
tenderly
call
the
Rough
Element
---
be
either
a
thief
,
or
the
companion
of
Thieves
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
infamously
molest
woman
come
out
of
chapel
on
Sunday
evening
(
for
which
I
would
have
his
back
scarify
often
and
deep
)
<EOS>
it
be
not
only
for
the
gratification
of
his
pleasant
instinct
,
but
that
there
may
be
a
confusion
raise
by
which
either
he
or
his
friend
may
profit
,
in
the
commission
of
highway
robbery
or
in
pick
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
get
a
police
-
constable
down
and
kick
him
helpless
for
life
,
it
be
because
that
constable
once
do
his
duty
in
bring
him
to
justice
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
rush
into
the
bar
of
a
public
-
house
and
scoop
an
eye
out
of
one
of
the
company
there
,
or
bite
his
ear
off
,
it
be
because
the
man
he
maim
give
evidence
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
and
a
line
of
comrade
extend
across
the
footway
---
say
of
that
solitary
mountain
-
spur
of
the
Abruzzi
,
the
Waterloo
Road
---
advance
towards
me
"
skylark
"
among
themselves
,
my
purse
or
shirt
-
pin
be
in
predestined
peril
from
his
playfulness
.
 
<EOS>
always
a
Ruffian
,
always
a
thief
.
 
<EOS>
always
a
thief
,
always
a
Ruffian
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
when
I
,
who
be
not
pay
to
know
these
thing
,
know
them
daily
on
the
evidence
of
my
sense
and
experience
;
when
I
know
that
the
Ruffian
never
jostle
a
lady
in
the
street
,
or
knock
a
hat
off
,
but
in
order
that
the
Thief
may
profit
,
be
it
surprising
that
I
should
require
from
those
who
are
pay
to
know
these
thing
,
prevention
of
them
?
   
<EOS>
look
at
this
group
at
a
street
corner
.
 
<EOS>
number
one
be
a
shirk
fellow
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
in
an
ill
-
favour
and
ill
-
savoured
suit
,
his
trouser
of
corduroy
,
his
coat
of
some
indiscernible
groundwork
for
the
deposition
of
grease
,
his
neckerchief
like
an
eel
,
his
complexion
like
dirty
dough
,
his
mangy
fur
cap
pull
low
upon
his
beetle
brow
to
hide
the
prison
cut
of
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
be
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
them
there
when
they
be
idle
,
as
naturally
as
in
other
people
's
pocket
when
they
be
busy
,
for
he
know
that
they
be
not
roughen
by
work
,
and
that
they
tell
a
tale
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
whenever
he
take
one
out
to
draw
a
sleeve
across
his
nose
---
which
be
often
,
for
he
have
weak
eye
and
a
constitutional
cold
in
his
head
---
he
restore
it
to
its
pocket
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Number
two
be
a
burly
brute
of
five
-
and
-
thirty
,
in
a
tall
stiff
hat
;
be
a
composite
as
to
his
clothe
of
betting

man
and
fighting
-
man
;
be
whisker
;
have
a
stare
pin
in
his
breast
,
along
with
his
right
hand
;
have
insolent
and
cruel
eye
:
 
large
shoulder
;
strong
leg
boot
and
tip
for

<EOS>
number

,
a

,
a
very
large
neckerchief
double
or
treble
round
his
throat
,
and
a
crumple
white
hat
crown
his
ghastly
parchment
face
.
 
<EOS>
this
fellow
look
like
an
execute
postboy
of
other
day
,
cut
down
from
the
gallow
too
soon
,
and
restore
and
preserve
by
express
diabolical

number
five

six
,
and

,
be
hulk

idle
,
slouch

and
too
tight
in
the
leg
,
slimily
clothe
,
foul
-
spoken
,
repulsive
wretch
inside
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
the
party
there
obtain
a
certain
twitching
character
of
mouth
and
furtiveness
of
eye
,
that
hint
how
the
coward
be
lurk
under
the
bully
.
 
<EOS>
the
hint
be
quite
correct
,
for
they
be
a
slinking
sneak
set
,
far
more
prone
to
lie
down
on
their
back
and
kick
out
,
when
in
difficulty
,
than
to
make
a
stand
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
(
this
may
account
for
the
street
mud
on
the
back
of
number
five
,
six
,
and
seven
,
be
much
fresh
than
the
stale
splash
on
their

)
   
<EOS>
these
engage
gentry
a

contemplate

<EOS>
His
Station

with
a
reserve
of

,
be
very
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
pretend
to
any
trade
,
not
even
to
be
porter
or
messenger
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
idle
if
they
do
,
for
he
know
them
,
and
they
know
that
he
know
them
,
to
be
nothing
but
profess
thief
and
Ruffians
.
<EOS>
He
know
where
they
resort
,
know
by
<EOS>
what
slang
name
they
call
one
another
,
know
how
often
they
have
be
in
prison
,
and
how
long
,
and
for
what
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
know
at
his

,
too
,
and
be
(
or
ought
to
be
)
know
at
Scotland
Yard

too

but
do
he
know

do
his
Station
know

or
do
Scotland

know

anybody

why

not

<EOS>
the

the

thus
humorously
tear
from

carry
off
in

open
street
at
noon

I

have
the
honour
of
myself
give
chase
,
on
Westminster
Bridge
,
to
another
young
Ruffian
,
who
,
in
full
daylight
early
on

summer
evening
,
have
nearly
throw
a
modest
young
woman
into
a
swoon

MR

CARLYLE
,
some
time
since
,
awaken
a
little
pleasantry
by
write
of
his
own
experience
of
the
Ruffian
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
ruffian
act
in
exact
accordance
with
Mr
Carlyle
's
description
,
innumerable
time
,
and
I
never
see
him
check
.
   
<EOS>
the
blare
use
of
the
very
bad
language
possible
,
in
our
public
thoroughfare
---
especially
in
those
set
apart
for
recreation
---
be
another
disgrace
to
us
,
and
another
result
of
constabular
contemplation
,
the
like
of
which
I
have
never
hear
in
any
other
country
to
which
my
uncommercial
travel
have
extend
.
 
<EOS>
year
ago
,
when
I
have
a
near
interest
in
certain
child
who
be
send
with
their
nurse
,
for
air
and
exercise
,
into
the
Regent
's
Park
,
I
find
this
evil
to
be
so
abhorrent
and
horrible
there
,
that
I
call
public
attention
to
it
,
and
also
to
its
contemplative
reception
by
the
Police
.
 
<EOS>
look
afterwards
into
the
new
Police
Act
,
and
find
that
the
offence
be
punishable
under
it
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
,
when
strike
occasion
should
arise
,
to
try
my
hand
as
prosecutor
.
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
arise
soon
enough
,
and
I
run
the
follow
gauntlet
.
   
<EOS>
the
utterer
of
the
base
coin
in
question
be
a
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
,
who
,
with
a
suitable
attendance
of
blackguard
,
youth
,
and
boy
,
be
flaunt
along
the
street
,
return
from
an
irish
funeral
,
in
a
Progress
intersperse
with
singing
and
dancing
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
turn
round
to
me
and
express
herself
in
the
most
audible
manner
,
to
the
great
delight
of
that
select
circle
.
 
<EOS>
I
attend
the
party
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
for
a
mile
further
,
and
then
encounter
a
police
-
constable
.
 
<EOS>
the
party
have
make
themselves
merry
at
my
expense
until
now
,
but
see
me
speak
to
the
constable
,
its
male
member
instantly
take
to
their
heel
,
leave
the
girl
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
the
constable
<EOS>
do
he
know
my
name
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
that
girl
into
custody
,
on
my
charge
,
for
use
bad
language
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
hear
of
such
a
charge
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Would
he
take
my
word
that
he
should
get
into
no
trouble
?
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
he
would
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
take
the
girl
,
and
I
go
home
for
my
Police
Act
.
   
<EOS>
with
this
potent
instrument
in
my
pocket
,
I
literally
as
well
as
figuratively
"
return
to
the
charge
,
"
and
present
myself
at
the
Police
Station
of
the
district
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
I
find
on
duty
a
very
intelligent
inspector
(
they
be
all
intelligent
man
)
,
who
,
likewise
,
have
never
hear
of
such
a
charge
.
 
<EOS>
I
show
him
my
clause
,
and
we
go
over
it
together
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
,
and
I
engage
to
wait
upon
the
suburban
Magistrate
to
-
morrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
put
my
Police
Act
in
my
pocket
again
,
and
wait
on
the
suburban
Magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
so
courteously
receive
by
him
as
I
should
have
be
by
the
Lord
Chancellor
or
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
,
but
that
be
a
question
of
good
breeding
on
the
suburban
Magistrate
's
part
,
and
I
have
my
clause
ready
with
its
leaf
<EOS>
turn
down
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
enough
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
conference
take
place
between
the
Magistrate
and
clerk
respect
the
charge
.
 
<EOS>
during
conference
I
be
evidently
regard
as
a
much
more
objectionable
person
than
the
prisoner
;
---
one
give
trouble
by
come
there
voluntarily
,
which
the
prisoner
could
not
be
accuse
of
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
prisoner
have
be
get
up
,
since
I
last
have
the
pleasure
of
see
her
,
with
a
great
effect
of
white
apron
and
straw
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
She
remind
me
of
an
eld
sister
of
Red
Riding
Hood
,
and
I
seem
to
remind
the
sympathise
Chimney
Sweep
by
whom
she
be
attend
,
of
the
Wolf
.
   
<EOS>
the
Magistrate
be
doubtful
,
Mr
Uncommercial
Traveller
,
whether
this
charge
could
be
entertain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Uncommercial
Traveller
reply
that
he
wish
it
be
better
know
,
and
that
,
if
he
could
afford
the
leisure
,
he
would
use
his
endeavour
to
make
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
question
about
it
,
however
,
he
contend
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
clause
.
   
<EOS>
the
clause
be
hand
in
,
and
more
conference
result
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
I
be
ask
the
extraordinary
question
:
 
"
Mr
Uncommercial
,
do
you
really
wish
this
girl
to
be
send
to
prison
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
I
grimly
answer
,
stare
:
 
"
if
I
do
not
,
why
should
I
take
the
trouble
to
come
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
finally
,
I
be
swear
,
and
give
my
agreeable
evidence
in
detail
,
and
White
Riding
Hood
be
fine
ten
shilling
,
under
the
clause
,
or
send
to
prison
for
so
many
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
say
the
police
-
officer
,
who
show
me
out
,
with
a
great
enjoyment
of
the
jest
of
her
have
be
get
up
so
effectively
,
and
cause
so
much
hesitation
:
 
"
if
she
go
to
prison
,
that
will
be
nothing
new
to
HER
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
from
Charles
Street
,
Drury
Lane
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
Police
,
all
thing
consider
,
be
an
excellent
force
,
and
I
have
bear
my
small
testimony
to
their
merit
.
 
<EOS>
constabular
contemplation
be
the
result
of
a
bad
system
;
a
system
which
be
administer
,
not
invent
,
by
the
man
in
constable
's
uniform
,
employ
at
twenty
shilling
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
his
order
,
and
would
be
mark
for
discouragement
if
he
overstep
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
system
be
bad
,
there
need
no
lengthen
argument
to
prove
,
because
the
fact
be
self
-
evident
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
anything
else
,
the
result
that
have
attend
it
could
not
possibly
have
come
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
who
will
say
that
under
a
good
system
,
our
street
could
have
get
into
their
present
state
?
   
<EOS>
the
objection
to
the
whole
police
system
,
as
concern
the
Ruffian
,
may
be
state
,
and
its
failure
exemplify
,
as
follow
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
know
that
on
all
great
occasion
,
when
they
come
together
in
number
,
the
mass
of
the
english
people
be
their
own
trustworthy
Police
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
that
wheresoever
there
be
collect
together
any
fair
general
representation
of
the
people
,
a
respect
for
law
and
order
,
and
a
determination
to
discountenance
lawlessness
and
disorder
,
may
be
rely
upon
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
one
another
,
the
people
be
a
very
good
Police
,
and
yet
be
quite
willing
in
their
good
-
nature
that
the
stipendiary
Police
should
have
the
credit
of
the
people
's
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
all
of
us
powerless
against
the
Ruffian
,
because
we
submit
to
the
law
,
and
it
be
his
only
trade
,
by
superior
force
and
by
violence
,
to
defy
it
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
we
be
constantly
admonish
from
high
place
(
like
so
many
Sunday
-
school
child
out
for
a
holiday
of
bun
and
milk
-
and
-
water
)
that
we
be
not
to
take
the
law
into
our
own
hand
,
but
be
to
hand
our
defence
over
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
common
enemy
to
be
punish
and
exterminate
first
of
all
be
the
Ruffian
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
he
be
,
of
all
other
,
the
offender
for
whose
repressal
we
maintain
a
costly
system
of
Police
.
 
<EOS>
Him
,
therefore
,
we
expressly
present
to
the
Police
to
deal
with
,
conscious
that
,
on
the
whole
,
we
can
,
and
do
,
deal
reasonably
well
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
Him
the
police
deal
with
so
inefficiently
and
absurdly
that
he
flourish
,
and
multiplie
,
and
,
with
all
his
evil
deed
upon
his
head
as
notoriously
as
his
hat
be
,
pervade
the
street
with
no
more
let
or
hindrance
than
ourselves
.

something
of
the
old
mexican
passion
for
flower
may
have
gradually
pass
into
North
America
,
where
flower
be
luxuriously
grow
,
and
tastefully
combine
in
the
rich
profusion
;
but
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
such
gorgeous
farewell
in
flower
have
come
on
board
,
that
the
small
officer
's
cabin
on
deck
,
which
I
tenant
,
bloom
over
into
the
adjacent
scupper
,
and
bank
of
other
flower
that
it
could
not
hold
make
a
garden
of
the
unoccupied
table
in
the
passenger

saloon
.
 
<EOS>
these
delicious
scent
of
the
shore
,
mingle
with
the
fresh
air
of
the
sea
,
make
the
atmosphere
a
dreamy
,
an
enchanting
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
the
watch
aloft
set
all
the
sail
,
and
with
the
screw
below
revolve
at
a
mighty
rate
,
and
occasionally
give
the
ship
an
angry
shake
for
resist
,
I
fall
into
my
idlest
way
,
and
lose
myself
.
   
<EOS>
as
,
for
instance
,
whether
it
be
I
lie
there
,
or
some
other
entity
even
more
mysterious
,
be
a
matter
<EOS>
I
be
far
too
lazy
to
look
into
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
it
signify
to
me
if
it
be
I
?
<EOS>
or
to
the
more
mysterious
entity
,
if
it
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
equally
as
to
the
remembrance
that
drowsily
float
by
me
,
or
by
him
,
why
ask
when
or
where
the
thing
happen
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
enough
that
they
befell
at
some
time
,
somewhere
?
   
<EOS>
there
be
that
assist
at
the
church
service
on
board
another
steamship
,
one
Sunday
,
in
a
stiff
breeze
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
on
the
passage
out
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
to
hear
the
ship
's
bell
go
as
like
church
-
bell
as
they
could
;
pleasant
to
see
the
watch
off
duty
muster
and
come
in
:
 
good
hat
,
good
guernsey
,
wash
hand
and
face
,
smooth
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
arise
a
set
of
circumstance
so
rampantly
comical
,
that
no
check
which
the
grave
intention
could
put
upon
them
would
hold
them
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
some
seventy
passenger
assemble
at
the

table
.
 
<EOS>
prayer

Pause

very

suddenly
burst

and

heavy

.
<EOS>
steward
watch
their
opportunity
,
and
balance
themselves
,
but
can
not
balance
minister
;
who
,
struggle
with
a
drooping
head
and
a
backward
tendency
,
seem
determined
to
return
below

while
they
be

slide
away
down
a

and

itself
at
the
breast
of
various

of

congregation
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
double
door
,
which
have
be
carefully
close
by
other
steward
,
fly
open
again
,
and
worldly
passenger
tumble
in
,
seemingly
with
pale

design
:

"

perceive
incongruity
,

"
Hullo

Beg

"
<EOS>
and
tumble
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
congregation
have
be
break
up
into
sect
,
---
as
the
manner
of
congregation
often
be
,
each
sect
slide
away
by
itself
,
and
all
pound
the
weak
sect
which
slide
first
into
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
utmost
point
of
dissent
soon
attain
in
every
corner
,
and
violent
rolling
.
 
<EOS>
steward
at
length
make
a
dash
;
conduct
minister
to
the
mast
in
the
centre
of
the
saloon
,
which
he
embrace
with
both
arm
;
skate
out
;
and
leave
him
in
that
condition
to
arrange
affair
with
flock
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
Sunday
,
when
an
officer
of
the
ship
read
the
service
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quiet
and
impressive
,
until
we
fall
upon
the
dangerous
and
perfectly
unnecessary
experiment
of
strike
up
a
hymn
.
 
<EOS>
after
it
be
give
out
,
we
all
rise
,
but
everybody
leave
it
to
somebody
else
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
Silence
result
,
the
officer
(
no
singer
himself
)
rather
reproachfully
give
us
the
first
line
again
,
upon
which
a
rosy
pippin
of
an
old
gentleman
,
remarkable
throughout
the
passage
for
his
cheerful
politeness
,
give
a
little
stamp
with
his
boot
(
as
if
he
be
lead
off
a
country
dance
)
,
and
blithely
warble
us
into
a
show
of
join
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
first
verse
we
become
,
through
these
tactic
,
so
much
refreshed
and
encourage
,
that
none
of
us
,
howsoever
unmelodious
,
would
submit
to
be
leave
out
of
the
second
verse
;
while
as
to
the
third
we
lift
up
our
voice
in
a
sacred
howl
that
leave
it
doubtful
whether
we
be
the
more
boastful
of
the
sentiment
we
unite
in
professing
,
or
of
profess
them
with
a
most
discordant
defiance
of
time
and
tune
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
think
I
,
when
the
fresh
remembrance
of
these
thing
make
me
laugh
heartily
alone
in
the
dead
water
-
gurgle
waste
of
the
night
,
what
time
I
be
wedge
into
my
berth
by
a
wooden
bar
,
or
I
must
have
roll
out
of
it
,
"
what
errand
be
I
then
upon
,
and
to
what
abyssinian
point
have
public
event
then
march
?
 
<EOS>
no
matter
as
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
them
,
if
the
wonderful
popular
rage
for
a
plaything
(
utterly
confound
in
its
inscrutable
unreason
)
I
have
not
then
light
on
a
poor
young
savage
boy
,
and
a
poor
old
screw
of
a
horse
,
and
haul
the
first
off
by
the
hair
of
his
princely
head
to
"
inspect
"
the
british
volunteer
,
and
haul
the
second
off
by
the
hair
of
his
equine
tail
to
the
Crystal
Palace
,
why
so
much
the
well
for
all
of
us
outside
Bedlam

"
   
<EOS>
so
,
stick
to
the

I
be
at
the
trouble
of
ask
myself
<EOS>
would
I

show
the

in

at

Grand
United
Amalgamated
Total
Abstinence

<EOS>
yes

I
think
I
should

<EOS>
I
think
it
would
do
them
good
to
smell
the

under
the

over

as

watch
the
filling
of
the
poison
chalice
(
truly

a
very
small

to
be
prosaic

toss
back
his
head

toss
the
content
into
himself

and
pass
the
empty
chalice
and
pass
on

so
the

with
an
anticipatory
wipe

bides
his

and
a
suddenly
awakened
tendency
to
be
jocose
with
some
shipmate

<EOS>
nor
do
I
even
observe
that
the
man
in
charge
of
the
ship
's
lamp
,
who
in
right
of
his
office
have
a
double
allowance
of
poison
chalice

seem
thereby
vastly
degrade

even
though
he
empty
the
chalice
into
himself

one

much
as

content
at
some
absorbent

<EOS>
but
vastly
comfort

I
note
them
all
to
be
,
on
deck
presently
,
even
to
the
circulation
of
red
blood
in
their
cold
blue
knuckle

and
when
I
look
up
at
them
lie
out
on
the
yard
,
and
hold
on
for
life
among
the
beating
sail
,
I
can
not
for
my
life
see
the
justice
of
visit
on
them
---
or
on
me
---
the
drunken
crime
of
any
number
of
criminal
arraign
at
the
heavy

<EOS>
abet
myself
in
my
idle
humour
,
I
close
my
eye
,
and
recall
life
on

of
one
of
those
mail

I
lay

part

that
day

in

<EOS>
the
regular

begin

mine

for
I
never

to
sleep
afterwards

with
the
rigging

dark

any

compose

It

be

no

the

I
call
it
in
my

by
the
high

<EOS>
because
it
seem

at

evening

it

It

It

one

the

take
place
in
any
such
diversion
<EOS>

the
voice
would
be
at

again

importune
us
to
the
last
extent

<EOS>
a
newly
marry
young
pair
,
who
walk
the
deck
affectionately
some
twenty
mile

would

in

suddenly
become
stricken
by

otherwise
immovable

under

<EOS>
when
this
terrible

be
most
severe
with

be
when
the
time
approach
for
our
retiring
to
our
den
for
the
night
;
when
the
light
candle
in
the
saloon
grow
few
and
few
;
when
the
desert
glass
with
spoon
in
them
grow
more
and
more
numerous
;
when
waifs
of
toast
cheese
and
stray
of
sardine
fry
in
batter
slide
languidly
to
and
fro
in
the
table

rack
;
when
the
man
who
always

have
shut
up
his
book

and
blow
out
his
candle
;
when
the
man
who
always
talk

cease
from
troubling

when
the
man
who
be
always
medically
report
as
go
to
have
delirium
tremen
have
put
it
off
till
to

two

who
every

button
himself
up

for
then

as

off
one

enter
our
several
hutch

come
into

to
us
<EOS>
when
we
sit
down
on
our
sofa
,
watch
the
swinge
candle
for
ever
try
and
retry
to
stand
upon
his
head
!
<EOS>
or
our
coat
upon
its
peg
,
imitate
us
as
we
appear
in
our
gymnastic
day
by
sustain
itself
horizontally
from
the
wall
,
in
emulation
of
the
light
and
more
facile
towel
!
<EOS>
then
would
the
voice
especially
claim
us
for
its
prey
,
and
rend
us
all
to
piece
.
   
<EOS>
light
out
,
we
in
our
berth
,
and
the
wind
rise
,
the
voice
grow
angry
and
deep
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
mattress
and
under
the
pillow
,
under
the
sofa
and
under
the
washing
-
stand
,
under
the
ship
and
under
the
sea
,
seem
to
rise
from
the
foundation
under
the
earth
with
every
scoop
of
the
great
Atlantic
(
<EOS>
and
oh
!
why
scoop
so
?
)
,
<EOS>
always
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Vain
to
deny
its
existence
in
the
night
season
;
impossible
to
be
hard
of
hear
;
screw
,
screw
,
screw
!
 
<EOS>
sometimes
it
lift
out
of
the
water
,
and
revolve
with
a
whirr
,
like
a
ferocious
firework
,
---
except
that
it
never
expend
itself
,
but
be
always
ready
to
go
off
again
;
sometimes
it
seem
to
be
in
anguish
,
and
shiver
;
sometimes
it
seem
to
be
terrify
by
its
last
plunge
,
and
have
a
fit
which
cause
it
to
struggle
,
quiver
,
and
for
an
instant
stop
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
ship
set
in
rolling
,
as
only
ship
so
fiercely
screw
through
time
and
space
,
day
and
night
,
fair
weather
and
foul
,
CAN
roll
.
   
<EOS>
do
she
ever
take
a
roll
before
like
that
last
?
 
<EOS>
do
she
ever
take
a
roll
before
like
this
bad
one
that
be
come
now
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
partition
at
my
ear
down
in
the
deep
on
the
lee
side
.
 
<EOS>
be
we
ever
come
up
again
together
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
;
the
partition
and
I
be
so
long
about
it
that
I
really
do
believe
we
have
overdo
it
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
Heavens
,
what
a
scoop
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
deep
scoop
,
what
a
hollow
scoop
,
what
a
long
scoop
!
 
<EOS>
Will
it
ever
end
,
and
can
we
bear
the
heavy
mass
of
water
we
have
take
on
board
,
and
which
have
let
loose
all
the
table
furniture
in
the
officer
'
mess
,
and
have
beat
open
the
door
of
the
little
passage
between
the
purser
and
me
,
and
be
swash
about
,
even
there
and
even
here
?
 
<EOS>
the
purser
snore
reassuringly
,
and
the
ship
's
bell
strike
,
I
hear
the
cheerful
"
<EOS>
all
be
well
!
"
<EOS>
of
the
watch
musically
give
back
the
length
of
the
deck
,
as
the
lately
diving
partition
,
now
high
in
air
,
try
(
unsoftene
by
what
we
have
go
through
together
)
to
force
me
out
of
bed
and
berth
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
be
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
Comforting
to
know
,
though
surely
all
may
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
put
aside
the
rolling
and
the
rush
of
water
,
and
think
of
dart
through
such
darkness
with
such
velocity
.
 
<EOS>
think
of
any
other
similar
object
come
in
the
opposite
direction
!
   
<EOS>
whether
there
may
be
an
attraction
in
two
such
move
body
out
at
sea
,
which
may
help
accident
to
bring
them
into
collision
?
<EOS>
thought
,
too
,
arise
(
the
voice
never
silent
all
the
while
,
but
marvellously
suggestive
)
of
the
gulf
below
;
of
the
strange
,
unfruitful
mountain
range
and
deep
valley
over
which
we
be
pass
;
of
monstrous
fish
midway
;
of
the
ship
's
suddenly
alter
her
course
on
her
own
account
,
and
with
a
wild
plunge
settle
down
,
and
make
that
voyage
with
a
crew
of
dead
discoverer
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
too
,
one
recall
an
almost
universal
tendency
on
the
part
of
passenger
to
stumble
,
at
some
time
or
other
in
the
day
,
on
the
topic
of
a
certain
large
steamer
make
this
same
run
,
which
be
lose
at
sea
,
and
never
hear
of
more
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
have
seem
under
a
spell
,
compelling
approach
to
the
threshold
of
the
grim
subject
,
stoppage
,
discomfiture
,
and
pretence
of
never
have
be
near
it
.
<EOS>
the
boatswain
's
whistle
sound
!
 
<EOS>
a
change
in
the
wind
,
hoarse
order
issuing
,
and
the
watch
very
busy
.
 
<EOS>
Sails
come
crash
home
overhead
,
rope
(
that
seem
all
knot
)
ditto
<EOS>
;
every
man
engage
appear
to
have
twenty
foot
,
with
twenty
time
the
average
amount
of
stamp
power
in
each
.
 
<EOS>
gradually
the
noise
slacken
,
the
hoarse
cry
die
away
,
the
boatswain
's
whistle
soften
into
the
soothing
and
contented
note
,
which
rather
reluctantly
admit
that
the
job
be
do
for
the
time
,
and
the
voice
set
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
thus
come
unintelligible
dream
of
up
hill
and
down
,
and
swinging
and
swaying
,
until
consciousness
revive
of
atmospherical
Windsor
soap
and
bilge
-
water
,
and
the
voice
announce
that
the
giant
have
come
for
the
water
-
cure
again
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
my
fanciful
reminiscence
as
I
lay
,
part
of
that
day
,
in
the
Bay
of
New
York
,
o
!
 
<EOS>
also
as
we
pass
clear
of
the
Narrows
,
and
get
out
to
sea
;
also
in
many
an
idle
hour
at
sea
in
sunny
weather
!
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
observation
and
computation
show
that
we
should
make
the
coast
of
Ireland
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
stand
watch
on
deck
all
night
to
-
night
,
to
see
how
we
make
the
coast
of
Ireland
.
   
<EOS>
very
dark
,
and
the
sea
most
brilliantly
phosphorescent
.
 
<EOS>
great
way
on
the
ship
,
and
double
look
-
out
keep
.
 
<EOS>
vigilant
captain
on
the
bridge
,
vigilant
first
officer
look
over
the
port
side
,
vigilant
second
officer
stand
by
the
quarter
-
master
at
the
compass
,
vigilant
third
officer
post
at
the
stern
rail
with
a
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
no
passenger
on
the
quiet
deck
,
but
expectation
everywhere
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
man
at
the
wheel
very
steady
,
very
serious
,
and
very
prompt
to
answer
order
.
 
<EOS>
an
order
issue
sharply
now
and
then
,
and
echo
back
;
otherwise
the
night
drag
slowly
,
silently
,
with
no
change
.
   
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
,
at
the
blank
hour
of
two
in
the
morning
,
a
vague
movement
of
relief
from
a
long
strain
express
itself
in
all
hand
;
the
third
officer
's
lantern
tinkle
,
and
he
fire
a
rocket
,
and
another
rocket
.
 
<EOS>
a
sullen
solitary
light
be
point
out
to
me
in
the
black
sky
yonder
.
 
<EOS>
a
change
be
expect
in
the
light
,
but
none
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
give
them
two
more
rocket
,
Mr
Vigilant
.
"
 
<EOS>
two
more
,
and
a
blue
-
light
burn
.
 
<EOS>
all
eye
watch
the
light
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
a
little
toy
sky
-
rocket
be
flash
up
from
it
;
and
,
even
as
that
small
streak
in
the
darkness
die
away
,
we
be
telegraph
to
Queenstown
,
Liverpool
,
and
London
,
and
back
again
under
the
ocean
to
America
.
   
<EOS>
then
up
come
<EOS>
the
half
-
dozen
passenger
who
be
go
ashore
at
Queenstown
and
up
come
the
mail
-
agent
in
charge
of
the
bag
,
and
up
come
the
man
who
be
to
carry
the
bag
into
the
mail
-
tender
that
will
come
off
for
them
out
of
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
Lamps
and
lantern
gleam
here
and
there
about
the
deck
,
and
impede
bulk
be
knock
away
with
handspike
;
and
the
port
-
side
bulwark
,
barren
but
a
moment
ago
,
burst
into
a
crop
of
head
of
seaman
,
steward
,
and
engineer
.
   
<EOS>
the
light
begin
to
be
gain
upon
,
begin
to
be
alongside
,
begin
to
be
leave
astern
.
 
<EOS>
More
rocket
,
and
,
between
us
and
the
land
,
steam
beautifully
the
Inman
steamship
City
of
Paris
,
for
New
York
,
outward
bind
.
 
<EOS>
We
observe
with
complacency
that
the
wind
be
dead
against
her
<EOS>
(
it
be
with
us
)
,
and
that
she
roll
and
pitch
.
<EOS>
(
the
sick
passenger
on
board
be
the
most
delighted
by
this
circumstance
.
)
 
<EOS>
Time
rush
by
as
we
rush
on
;
and
now
we
see
the
light
in
Queenstown
Harbour
,
and
now
the
light
of
the
mail
-
tender
come
out
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
what
vagarie
the
mail
-
tender
perform
on
the
way
,
in
every
point
of
the
compass
,
especially
in
those
where
she
have
no
business
,
and
why
she
perform
them
,
Heaven
only
know
!
 
<EOS>
at
length
she
be
see
plunge
within
a
cable
's
length
of
our
port
broadside
,
and
be
be
roar
at
through
our
speaking
-
trumpet
to
do
this
thing
,
and
not
to
do
that
,
and
to
stand
by
the
other
,
as
if
she
be
a
very
demente
tender
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
we
slacken
amidst
a
deafening
roar
of
steam
,
this
much
-
abuse
tender
be
make
fast
to
us
by
hawser
,
and
the
man
in
readiness
carry
the
bag
aboard
,
and
return
for
more
,
bend
under
their
burden
,
and
look
just
like
the
pasteboard
figure
of
the
miller
and
his
man
in
the
theatre
of
our
boyhood
,
and
comport
themselves
almost
as
unsteadily
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
while
the
unfortunate
tender
plunge
high
and
low
,
and
be
roar
at
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
queenstown
passenger
be
put
on
board
of
her
,
with
infinite
plunging
and
roar
,
and
the
tender
get
heave
up
on
the
sea
to
that
surprising
extent
that
she
look
within
an
ace
of
washing
aboard
of
us
,
high
and
dry
.
 
<EOS>
roar
at
with
contumely
to
the
last
,
this
wretched
tender
be
at
length
let
go
,
with
a
final
plunge
of
great
ignominy
,
and
fall
spin
into
our
wake
.
   
<EOS>
the
voice
of
conscience
resume
its
dominion
as
the
day
climb
up
the
sky
,
and
keep
by
all
of
us
passenger
into
port
;
keep
by
us
as
we
pass
other
lighthouse
,
and
dangerous
island
off
the
coast
,
where
some
of
the
officer
,
with
whom
I
stand
my
watch
,
have
go
ashore
in
sailing
-
ship
in
fog
(
and
of
which
by
that
token
they
seem
to
have
quite
an
affectionate
remembrance
)
,
and
past
the
Welsh
coast
,
and
past
the
Cheshire
coast
,
and
past
everything
and
everywhere
lie
between
our
ship
and
her
own
special
dock
in
the
Mersey
.
 
<EOS>
off
which
,
at
last
,
at
nine
of
the
clock
,
on
a
fair
evening
early
in
May
,
we
stop
,
and
the
voice
cease
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
curious
sensation
,
not
unlike
have
my
own
ear
stop
,
ensue
upon
that
silence
;
and
it
be
with
a
no
less
curious
sensation
that
I
go
over
the
side
of
the
good
Cunard
ship
"
Russia
"
(
whom
prosperity
attend
through
all
her
voyage
!
)
<EOS>
and
survey
the
outer
hull
of
the
gracious
monster
that
the
voice
have
inhabit
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
perhaps
,
shall
we
all
,
in
the
spirit
,
one
day
survey
the
frame
that
hold
the
busy
voice
from
which
my
vagrant
fancy
derive
this
similitude
.
    
<EOS>
Number
31
:
a
Small
Star
in
the
East
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
look
,
yesternight
,
through
the
famous
"
Dance
of
death
,
"
and
to
-
day
the
grim
old
woodcut
arise
in
my
mind
with
the
new
significance
of
a
ghastly
monotony
not
to
be
find
in
the
original
.
 
<EOS>
the
weird
skeleton
rattle
along
the
street
before
me
,
and
strike
fiercely
;
but
it
be
never
at
the
pain
of
assume
a
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
It
play
on
no
dulcimer
here
,
be
crown
with
no
flower
,
wave
no
plume
,
mince
in
no
flow
robe
or

,
lift
no
wine
-
cup
,
sit
at
no
feast
,
cast
no
dice
,
count
no
gold
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
simply
a
bare
,
gaunt
,
famished
skeleton
,
slay
his
way
along
.
   
<EOS>
the
border
of
Ratcliff
and
Stepney
,
eastward
of
London
,
and
give
on
the
impure
river
,
be
the
scene
of
this
uncompromising
dance
of
death
,
upon
a
drizzle
November
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
squalid
maze
of
street
,
court
,
and
alley
of
miserable
house
let
out
in
single
room
.
 
<EOS>
a
wilderness
of
dirt
,
rag
,
and
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
a
mud
-
desert
,
chiefly
inhabit
by
a
tribe
from
whom
employment
have
depart
,
or
to
whom
it
come
but
fitfully
and
rarely
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
skilled
mechanic
in
any
wise
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
but
labourer
,
---
dock
-
labourer
,
water
-
side
labourer
,
coal
-
porter
,
ballast
-
heaver
,
such
-
like
hewer
of
wood
and
drawer
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
have
come
into
existence
,
and
they
propagate
their
wretched
race
.
   
<EOS>
one
grisly
joke
alone
,
methought
<EOS>
,
the
skeleton
seem
to
play
off
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
stick
election
-
bill
on
the
wall
,
which
the
wind
and
rain
have
deteriorate
into
suitable
rag
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
even
sum
up
the
state
of
the
poll
,
in
chalk
,
on
the
shutter
of
one
ruin
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
adjure
the
free
and
independent
starver
to
vote
for
Thisman
and
vote
for
Thatman
;
not
to
plump
,
as
they
value
the
state
of
party
and
the
national
prosperity
(
both
of
great
importance
to
them
,
I
think
)
;
but
,
by
return
Thisman
and
Thatman
,
each
naught
without
the
other
,
to
compound
a
glorious
and
immortal
whole
.
 
<EOS>
surely
the
skeleton
be
nowhere
more
cruelly
ironical
in
the
original
monkish
idea
!
   
<EOS>
ponder
in
my
mind
the
far
-
see
scheme
of
Thisman
and
Thatman
,
and
of
the
public
blessing
call
Party
,
for
stay
the
degeneracy
,
physical
and
moral
,
of
many
thousand
(
who
shall
say
how
many
?
)
of
the
english
race
;
for
devise
employment
useful
to
the
community
for
those
who
want
but
to
work
and
live
;
for
equalise
rate
,
cultivate
waste
land
,
facilitate
emigration
,
and
,
above
all
thing
,
save
and
utilise
the
oncoming
generation
,
and
thereby
change
ever
-
grow
national
weakness
into
strength
:
 
ponder
in
my
mind
,
I
say
,
these
hopeful
exertion

down
a
narrow
street
to
look
into

It

the

have
pick
up
some
long
strip
of
wood

about

It

I

state
at

that
my

not
detect
any
indication

an
expectation

I

they
be
grateful

about
their
miserable

sympathy
be
plainly
a
comfort

them

they
neither
ask

<EOS>
with

I
leave

<EOS>
some
street
away
,
I
tap
at
another
parlour

door
on
another
ground
-
floor
.
 
<EOS>
look
in
,
I
find
a
man
,
his
wife
,
and
four
child
,
sit
at
a
washing

stool
by
way
of
table
,
at

infuse
tea

leave

<EOS>
there
be
a
very
scanty
cinderous
fire
in
the
grate
by
which
they
sit
;
and
there
be
a
tent
bedstead
in
the
room
with
a
bed
upon

and
a
coverlet

<EOS>
the
man
do
not
rise
when
I
go
in

nor
during
my
stay

but
civilly
incline
his
head
on
my
pulling
off
my
hat
,
and
,
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
whether
I
may
ask
him
a
question
or
two
,
say
,
"
certainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
window
at
each
end
of
this
room
,
back
and
front
,
it
may
have
be
ventilate
;
but
it
be
shut
up
tight
,
to
keep
the
cold
out
,
and
be
very
sickening
.
   
<EOS>
the
wife
,
an
intelligent
,
quick
woman
,
rise
and
stand
at
her
husband
's
elbow
;
and
he
glance
up
at
her
as
if
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
appear
that
he
be
rather
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
slow

simple
fellow
of
about
thirty
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Gentleman

<EOS>
"
I
be
a

"
He

cry
this
forlorn
boilermaker
,
stare
aghast
at
his
wife
,
and
then
work
his
vision
's
way
very
slowly
round
to
me
:
"
<EOS>
Lord
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
he
be
not

"
say
the
poor
woman
,
shake
her
head
,
as
she
look
at
the
four
child
in
succession
,
and
then
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
work
!
"
say
the
boilermaker
,
still
seek
that
evaporate
boiler
,
first
in
my
countenance
,
then
in
the
air
,
and
then
in
the
feature
of
his
second
son
at
his
knee
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
in
work

<EOS>
I
have
not
have
more
than
a
day

do
this
three
week
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
have
you
live
?
"
   
<EOS>
a
faint
gleam
of
admiration
light
up
the
face
of
the
would
-
be
boilermaker
,
as
he
stretch
out
the
short
sleeve
of
his
thread
-
bare
canvas
jacket
,
and
reply
,
point
her
out
,
"
on
the
work
of
the
wife
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
forget
where
boilermaking
have
go
to
,
or
where
he
suppose
it
have
go
to
;
but
he
add
some
resign
information
on
that
head
,
couple
with
an
expression
of
his
belief
that
it
be
never
come
back
.
   
<EOS>
the
cheery
helpfulness
of
the
wife
be
very
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
slop
-
work
;
make
pea
-
jacket
.
 
<EOS>
She
produce
the
pea
-
jacket
then
in
hand
,
and
spread
it
out
upon
the
bed
,
---
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
on
which
to
spread
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
show
how
much
of
it
she
make
,
and
how
much
be
afterwards
finish
off
by
the
machine
.
<EOS>
accord
to
her
calculation
at
the
moment
,
deduct
what
her
trim
cost
her
,
she
get
for
make
a
pea
-
jacket
tenpence
half
-
penny
,
and
she
could
make
one
in
something
less
than
two
day
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
you
see
,
it
come
to
her
through
two
hand
,
and
of
course
it
do
not
come
through
the
second
hand
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
it
come
through
the
second
hand
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
hand
take
the
risk
of
the
give
-
out
work
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
money
enough
to
pay
the
security
deposit
,
---
call
it
two
pound
,
---
she
could
get
the
work
from
the
first
hand
,
and
so
the
second
would
not
have
to
be
deduct
for
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
have
no
money
at
all
,
the
second
hand
come
in
and
take
its
profit
,
and
so
the
whole
work
down
to
tenpence
half
-
penny
.
 
<EOS>
have
explain
all
this
with
great
intelligence
,
even
with
some
little
pride
,
and
without
a
whine
or
murmur
,
she
fold
her
work
again
,
sit
down
by
her
husband
's
side
at
the
washing
-
stool
,
and
resume
her
dinner
of
dry
bread
.
 
<EOS>
mean
as
the
meal
be
,
on
the
bare
board
,
with
its
old
gallipot
for
cup
,
and
what
not
other
sordid
makeshift
;
shabby
as
the
woman
be
in
dress
,
and
toning
do
towards
the
Bosjesman
colour
,
with
want
of
nutriment
and
washing

there

positively
a

<EOS>
when

slowly
turn

these

<EOS>
there

two

and
there
be
a
break
bottle
or
so

and
there
be
some
break
box
for
seat

<EOS>
the
last
small
scraping
of
coal
leave
be
rake
together
in

not
purposely
colour
black

the

so
begrime

she
have
not

a
piece

soap

wash

apologise
for
her
occupation

I
could
take
in
all
these
thing
without
appear

notice
them

could
even
correct
my
inventory

<EOS>
I
have
miss

at

some
half
a

certain
fragment

<EOS>
this

,
like
the

be
woefully
shabby

be
degenerate
to
the
Bosjesman
complexion

<EOS>
but
her
figure
,
and
the
ghost
of
a
certain
vivacity
about
her
,
and
the
spectre
of
a
dimple
in
her
cheek
,
carry
my
memory
strangely
back
to
the
old
day
of

They

They

<EOS>
He
look
at
his
leg
(
which
be
much
discolour
and
misshapen
)
for
a
while
,
and
then
appear
to
remember
that
they
be
not
popular
with
his

roll
them
up

as
if
they

something
in

"
   
<EOS>
these
people
have
a
mortal
dread
of
enter
the
workhouse
,
and
receive
no
out
-
of
-
door
relief
.
   
<EOS>
in
another
room
,
in
still
another
tenement
,
I
find
a
very
decent
woman
with
five
child
,
---
the
last
a
baby
,
and
she
herself
a
patient
of
the
parish
doctor
,
---
to
whom
,
her
husband
be
in
the
hospital
,
the
Union
allow
for
the
support
of
herself
and
family
,
four
shilling
a
week
and
five
loaf

<EOS>
I
suppose
when
Thisman
,
MP

,
and
Thatman
,
MP
.
,
and
the
public
-
bless
Party
,
lie
their
head
together
in
course
of
time
,
and
come
to
an
equalization
of
rating
,
she
may
go
down
to
the
dance
of
death
to
the
tune
of
sixpence
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
enter
no
other
house
for
that
one
while
,
for
I
could
not
bear
the
contemplation
of
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
such
heart
as
I
have
summon
to
sustain
me
against
the
misery
of
the
adult
fail
me
when
I
look
at
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
how
young
they
be
,
<EOS>
how
hungry
,
how
serious
and
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
them
,
sick
and
die
in
those
lair
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
them
dead
without
anguish
;
but
to
think
of
them
so
suffer
and
so
die
<EOS>
quite
unmanned
me
.
   
<EOS>
down
by
the
river
's
bank
in
Ratcliff
<EOS>
,
I
be
turn
upward
by
a
side
-
street
,
therefore
,
to
regain
the
railway
,
when
my
eye
rest
on
the
inscription
across
the
road
,
"
East
London
Children
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
have
see
an
inscription
better
suited
to
my
frame
of
mind
;
and
I
go
across
and
go
straight
in
.
   
<EOS>
I
find
the
child
's
hospital
establish
in
an
old
sail
-
loft
or
storehouse
,
of
the
rough
nature
,
and
on
the
simple
mean
.
<EOS>
there
be
trap
-
door
in
the
floor
,
where
good
have
be
hoist
up
and
down
;
heavy
foot
and
heavy
weight
have
start
every
knot
in
the
well
-
trodden
planking
:
 
inconvenient
bulk
and
beam
and
awkward
staircase
perplex
my
passage
through
the
ward
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
it
airy
,
sweet
,
and
clean
.
 
<EOS>
in
its
seven
and
thirty
bed
I
see
but
<EOS>
little
beauty
;
for
starvation
in
the
second
or
third
generation
take
a
pinched
look
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
the
suffering
both
of
infancy
and
childhood
tenderly
assuage
;
I
hear
the
little
patient
answer
to
pet
playful
name
,
the
light
touch
of
a
delicate
lady
lay
bare
the
waste
stick
of
arm
for
me
to
pity
;
and
the
claw
-
like
little
hand
,
as
she
do
so
,
twine
themselves
lovingly
around
her
wedding
-
ring
.
   
<EOS>
one
baby
mite
there
be
as
pretty
as
any
of
Raphael
's
angel
.
 
<EOS>
the
tiny
head
be
bandage
for
water
on
the
brain
;
and
it
be
suffer
with
acute
bronchitis
too
,
and
make
from
time
to
time
a
plaintive
,
though
not
impatient
or
complain
,
little
sound
.
 
<EOS>
the
smooth
curve
of
the
cheek
and
of
the
chin
be
faultless
in
its
condensation
of
infantine
beauty
,
and
the
large
bright
eye
be
most
lovely
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
as
I
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
that
these
eye
rest
upon
mine
with
that
wistful
expression
of
wonder
thoughtfulness
which
we
all
know
sometimes
in
very
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
They
remain
fix
on
mine
,
and
never
turn
from
me
while
I
stand
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
utterance
of
that
plaintive
sound
shake
the
little
form
,
the
gaze
still
remain
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
though
the
child
implore
me
to
tell
the
story
of
the
little
hospital
in
which
it
be
shelter
to
any
gentle
heart
I
could
address
.
 
<EOS>
lay
my
world
-
wear
hand
upon
the
little
unmarked
clasped
hand
at
the
chin
,
I
give
it
a
silent
promise
that
I
would
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
a
gentleman
and
lady
,
a
young
husband
and
wife
,
have
buy
and
fit
up
this
building
for
its
present
noble
use
,
and
have
quietly
settle
themselves
in
it
as
its
medical
officer
and
director
.
<EOS>
both
have
have
considerable
practical
experience
of
medicine
and
surgery
;
he
as
house
-
surgeon
of
a
great
London
hospital
;
she
as
a
very
earnest
student
,
test
by
severe
examination
,
and
also
as
a
nurse
of
the
sick
poor
during
the
prevalence
of
cholera
.
   
<EOS>
with
every
qualification
to
lure
them
away
,
with
youth
and
accomplishment
and
taste
and
habit
that
can
have
no
response
in
any
breast
near
them
,
close
begirt
by
every
repulsive
circumstance
inseparable
from
such
a
neighbourhood
,
there
they
dwell
.
 
<EOS>
They
live
in
the
hospital
itself
,
and
their
room
be
on
its
first
floor
.
<EOS>
sit
at
their
dinner
-
table
,
they
could
hear
the
cry
of
one
of
the
child
in
pain
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
's
piano
,
drawing
-
material
,
book
,
and
other
such
evidence
of
refinement
be
as
much
a
part
of
the
rough
place
as
the
iron
bedstead
of
the
little
patient
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
put
to
shift
for
room
,
like
passenger
on
board
ship
.
 
<EOS>
the
dispenser
of
medicine
(
attract
to
them
not
by
self

interest
,
but
by
their
own
magnetism
and
that
of
their
cause
)
sleep
in
a
recess
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
have
his
wash
apparatus
in
the
sideboard
.
   
<EOS>
Their
contented
manner
of
make
the
good
of
the
thing
around
them
<EOS>
,
I
find
so
pleasantly
inseparable
from
their
usefulness
!
<EOS>
Their
pride
in
this
partition
that
we
put
up
ourselves
,
or
in
that
partition
that
we
take
down
,
or
in
that
other
partition
that
we
move
,
or
in
the
stove
that
be
give
us
for
the
waiting
-
room
,
or
in
our
nightly
conversion
of
the
little
consulting
-
room
into
a
smoking
-
room
!
 
<EOS>
Their
admiration
of
the
situation
,
if
we
could
only
get
rid
of
its
one
objectionable
incident
,
the

him
with
a

<EOS>
He
be
merrily
wag
his
tail
on
a
boy
's
pillow
when
he
make
this
modest
appeal
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
when
this
hospital
be
first
open
,
in
January
of
the
present
year
,
the
people
could
not
possibly
conceive
but
that
somebody
pay
for
the
service
render
there
;
and
be
dispose
to
claim
them
as
a
right
,
and
to
find
fault
if
out
of
temper
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
come
to
understand
the
case
better
,
and
have
much
increase
in
gratitude
.
<EOS>
the
mother
of
the
patient
avail
themselves
very
freely
of
the
visit
rule
;
the
father
often
on
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
unreasonable
(
but
still
,
I
think
,
touching
and
intelligible
)
tendency
in
the
parent
to
take
a
child
away
to
its
wretched
home
,
if
on
the
point
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
one
boy
who
have
be
thus
carry
off
on
a
rainy
night
,
when
in
a
violent
state
of
inflammation
,
and
who
have
be
afterwards
bring
back
,
have
be
recover
with
exceed
difficulty
;
but
he
be
a
jolly
boy
,
with
a
specially
strong
interest
in
his
dinner
,
when
I
see
him
.
   
<EOS>
insufficient
food
and
unwholesome
living
be
the
main
cause
of
disease
among
these
small
patient
.
 
<EOS>
so
nourishment
,
cleanliness
,
and
ventilation
be
the
main
remedy
.
 
<EOS>
discharged
patient
be
look
after
,
and
invite
to
come
and
dine
now
<EOS>
and
then
;
so
be
certain
famish
creature
who
be
never
patient
.
 
<EOS>
both
the
lady
and
the
gentleman
be
well
acquainted
,
not
only
with
the
history
of
the
patient
and
their
family
,
but
with
the
character
and
circumstance
of
great
number
of
their
neighbour
---
of
these
they
keep
a
register
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
their
common
experience
,
that
people
,
sink
down
by
inch
into
deep
and
deep
poverty
,
will
conceal
it
,
even
from
them
,
if
possible
,
unto
the
very
last
extremity
.
   
<EOS>
the
nurse
of
this
hospital
be
all
young
,
---
range
,
say
,
from
nineteen
to
four
and
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
even
within
these
narrow
limit
,
what
many
well
-
endow
hospital
would
not
give
them
,
a
comfortable
room
of
their
own
in
which
to
take
their
meal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
truth
,
that
interest
in
the
child
and
sympathy
with
their
sorrow
bind
these
young
woman
to
their
place
far
more
strongly
than
any
other
consideration
could
.
 
<EOS>
the
best
skilled
of
the
nurse
come
originally
from
a
kindre
neighbourhood
,
almost
as
poor
;
and
she
know
how
much
the
work
be
need
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
fair
dressmaker
.
 
<EOS>
the
hospital
can
not
pay
her
as
many
pound
in
the
year
as
there
be
month
in
it
;
and
one
day
the
lady
regard
it
as
a
duty
to
speak
to
her
about
her
improve
her
prospect
and
follow
her
trade
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
:
 
she
could
never
be
so
useful
or
so
happy
elsewhere
any
more
;
she
must
stay
among
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
and
she
stay
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
nurse
,
as
I
pass
her
,
be
wash
a
baby
-
boy
.
 
<EOS>
like
her
pleasant
face
,
I
stop
to
speak
to
her
charge
,
---
a
common
,
bullet
-
head
,
frown
charge
enough
,
lay
hold
of
his
own
nose
with
a
slippery
grasp
,
and
stare
very
solemnly
out
of
a
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
the
melting
of
the
pleasant
face
into
delighted
smile
,
as
this
young
gentleman
give
an
unexpected
kick
,
and
laugh
at

I
part

my

now
in

,
I
see
in
his
easy
black
necktie
,
in
his
loose
button
black
frock

coat
,
in
his
pensive
face
,
in
the
flow
of
his
dark
hair
,
in
his
eyelash
,
in
the
very
turn
of
his
moustache
,
the
exact
realisation
of
the
Paris
artist
's
ideal
as
it
be
present
on
the
stage

<EOS>
but
no

this
young

Children

London

<EOS>
I
come
away
from
Ratcliff
by

Stepney
railway

<EOS>
a
Little
Dinner
in
an
hour
 
<EOS>
It
fall
out
on
a
day
in
this
last
autumn
,
that
I
have
to
go
down
from
London
to
a
place
of
seaside
resort
,
on
an
hour
's
business
,
accompany
by
my
esteemed
friend
Bullfinch
.
 
<EOS>
let
the
place
of
seaside
resort
be
,
for
the
nonce
,
call
Namelesston
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
loiter
about
Paris
in
very
hot
weather
,
pleasantly
breakfast
in
the
open
air
in
the
garden
of
the
Palais
Royal
or
the
tuilerie
,
pleasantly
dine
in
the
open
air
in
the
elysian
Fields
,
pleasantly
take
my
cigar
and
lemonade
in
the
open
air
on
the
Italian
Boulevard
towards
the
small
hour
after
midnight
.
<EOS>
Bullfinch
---
an
excellent
man
of
business
---
have
summon
me
back
across
the
Channel
,
to
transact
this
say
hour
's
business
at
Namelesston
;
and
thus
it
fall
out
that
Bullfinch
and
I
be
in
a
railway
carriage
together
on
our
way
to
Namelesston
,
each
with
his
return
-
ticket
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
say
Bullfinch
,
"
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
dine
at
the
Temeraire
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
Bullfinch
,
do
he
recommend
the
Temeraire
?
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
have
not
be
rate
on
the
book
of
the
Temeraire
for
many
year
.
   
<EOS>
Bullfinch
decline
to
accept
the
responsibility
of
recommend
the
Temeraire
,
but
on
the
whole
be
rather
sanguine
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
"
seem
to
remember
,
"
Bullfinch
say
,
that
he
have
dine
well
there
.
<EOS>
a
plain
dinner
,
but
good
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
not
like
a
parisian
dinner
<EOS>
(
here
Bullfinch
obviously
become
the
prey
of
want
of
confidence
)
,
but
of
its
kind
very
fair
.
   
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
Bullfinch
's
intimate
knowledge
of
my
want
and
way
to
decide
whether
I
be
usually
ready
to
be
pleased
with
any
dinner
,
or
---
for
the
matter
of
that
---
with
anything
that
be
fair
of
its
kind
and
really
what
it
claim
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Bullfinch
do
me
the
honour
to
respond
in
the
affirmative
,
I
agree
to
ship
myself
as
an
able
trencherman
on
board
the
Temeraire
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
our
plan
shall
be
this
,
"
say
Bullfinch
,
with
his
forefinger
at
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
we
get
to
Namelesston
,
we
will
drive
straight
to
the
Temeraire
,
and
order
a
little
dinner
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
and
as
we
shall
not
have
more
than
enough
time
in
which
to
dispose
of
it
comfortably
,
what
do
you
say
to
give
the
house
the
good
opportunity
of
serve
it
hot
and
quickly
by
dine
in
the
coffee
-
room
?
"
   
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
say
be
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Bullfinch
(
who
be
by
nature
of
a
hopeful
constitution
)
then
begin
to
babble
of
green
geese
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
check
him
in
that
falstaffian
vein
,
urge
consideration
of
time
and
cookery
.
   
<EOS>
in
due
sequence
of
event
we
drive
up
to
the
Temeraire
,
and
alight
.
 
<EOS>
a
youth
in
livery
receive
us
on
the
door
-
step
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
well
,
"
say
Bullfinch
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
aloud
,
<EOS>
"
coffee
-
room
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
youth
in
livery
(
now
perceive
to
be
mouldy
)
conduct
us
to
the
desire
haven
,
and
be
enjoin
by
Bullfinch
to
send
the
waiter
at
once
,
as
we
wish
to
order
a
little
dinner
in
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
then
Bullfinch
and
I
wait
for
the
waiter
,
until
,
the
waiter
continue
to
wait
in
some
unknown
and
invisible
sphere
of
action
,
we
ring
for
the
waiter
;
which
ring
produce
the
waiter
,
who
announce
himself
as
not
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon
us
,
and
who
do
not
wait
a
moment
longer
.
   
<EOS>
so
Bullfinch
approach
the
coffee
-
room
door
,
and
melodiously
pitch
his
voice
into
a
bar
where
two
young
lady
be
keep
the
book
of
the
Temeraire
<EOS>
,
apologetically
explain
that
we
wish
to
order
a
little
dinner
in
an
hour
,
and
that
we
be
debar
from
the
execution
of
our
inoffensive
purpose
by
consignment
to
solitude
.
   
<EOS>
Hereupon
one
of
the
young
lady
run
a
bell
,
which
reproduce
---
at
the
bar
this
time
---
the
waiter
who
be
not
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon
us
;
that
extraordinary
man
,
whose
life
seem
consume
in
wait
upon
people
to
say
that
he
would
not
wait
upon
them
,
repeat
his
former
protest
with
great
indignation
,
and
retire
.
   
<EOS>
Bullfinch
,
with
a
fall
countenance
,
be
about
to
say
to
me
,
"
this
will
not
do
,
"
when
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon
us
leave
off
keep
us
wait
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
"
say
Bullfinch
piteously
,
"
we
have
be
a
long
time
wait
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon
us
lay
the
blame
upon
the
waiter
who
ought
not
to
wait
upon
us
,
and
say
it
be
all
that
waiter
's
fault
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
wish
,
"
say
Bullfinch
,
much
depressed
,
"
to
order
a
little
dinner
in
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
we
have
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
like
to
have
,
gentleman
?
"
   
<EOS>
Bullfinch
,
with
extreme
mournfulness
of
speech
and
action
,
and
with
a
forlorn
old
fly
-
blow
bill
of
fare
in
his
hand
which
the
waiter
have
give
him
,
and
which
be
a
sort
of
general
manuscript
index
to
any
cookery
-
book
you
please
,
move
the
previous
question
.
   
<EOS>
We
could
have
mock
-
turtle
soup
,
a
sole
,
curry
,
and
roast
duck
.
<EOS>
agree
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
table
by
this
window
.
 
<EOS>
punctually
in
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
feign
to
look
out
of
this
window
;
but
I
have
be
take
note
of
the
crumb
on
all
the
table
,
the
dirty
table
-
cloth
,
the
stuffy
,
soupy
,
airless
atmosphere
,
the
stale
leaving
everywhere
about
,
the
deep
gloom
of
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon
us
,
and
the
stomach
-
ache
with
which
a
lonely
traveller
at
a
distant
table
in
a
corner
be
too
evidently
afflict
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
point
out
to
Bullfinch
the
alarming
circumstance
that
this
traveller
have
DINED
.
 
<EOS>
We
hurriedly
debate
whether
,
without
infringement
of
good
breeding
,
we
could
ask
him
to
disclose
if
he
have
partake
of
mock
-
turtle
,
sole
,
curry
,
or
roast
duck
?
 
<EOS>
We
decide
that
the
thing
could
not
be
politely
do
,
and
we
have
set
our
own
stomach
on
a
cast
,
and
they
must
stand
the
hazard
of
the
die
.
   
<EOS>
I
hold
phrenology
,
within
certain
limit
,
to
be
true
;
I
be
much
of
the
same
mind
as
to
the
subtler
expression
of
the
hand
;
I
hold
physiognomy
to
be
infallible
;
though
all
these
science
demand
rare
quality
in
the
student
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
also
hold
that
there
be
no
more
certain
index
to
personal
character
than
the
condition
of
a
set
of
caster
<EOS>
be
to
the
character
of
any
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
,
and
have
often
test
this
theory
of
mine
<EOS>
,
Bullfinch
resign
himself
to
the
bad
,
when
,
lay
aside
any
remain
veil
of
disguise
,
I
hold
up
before
him
in
succession
the
cloudy
oil
and
furry
vinegar
,
the
clogged
cayenne
,
the
dirty
salt
,
the
obscene
dreg
of
soy
,
and
the
anchovy
sauce
in
a
flannel
waistcoat
of
decomposition
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
out
to
transact
our
business
.
 
<EOS>
so
inspirit
be
the
relief
of
pass
into
the
clean
and
windy
street
of
Namelesston
from
the
heavy
and
vapid
closeness
of
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
Temeraire
,
that
hope
begin
to
revive
within
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
begin
to
consider
that
perhaps
the
lonely
traveller
have
take
physic
,
or
do
something
injudicious
to
bring
his
complaint
on
.
 
<EOS>
Bullfinch
remark
that
he
think
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon
us
have
brighten
a
little
when
suggest
curry
;
and
although
I
know
him
to
have
be
at
that
moment
the
express
image
of
despair
,
I
allow
myself
to
become
elevated
in
spirit

Bullfinch
,
then
,
to
the
youth
in

,
with
boldness
,
"
Lavatory

when
we
arrive
at
the
family
vault
with
a
skylight
,
which
the
youth
in

present
as

seek
,
we
have
already
whisk
off

in

and
no

we
put

unwashed
to

<EOS>
there
the
waiter
who
ought
to
wait
upon

have
set
forth
our

on

<EOS>
we

recognise
by
the

and
now
there
occur

that
the

swoop
down
upon
us
,
clutch
our
loaf
of
bread

<EOS>
Bullfinch
,
with
distracted
eye

be
follow
this
unaccountable
figure
"
out

He
wipe

We

however
it
be
explain

in

Mr

be
hear
to

nothing

"
Ah

indeed

<EOS>
yes

and
shortly
afterwards
go
out

a
milder

<EOS>
the
lonely
traveller
with
the
stomach

ache
have
all
this

suffer
severely

draw
up
a

then
,
and
sip
hot
brandy

and
-
water
with
grate
ginger
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
taste
our
(
very
)
mock
-
turtle
soup
,
and
be
instantly
seize
with
symptom
of
some
disorder
simulate
apoplexy
,
and
occasion
by
the

of
nose

with

)
seventy

five

of
miscellaneous

roll
into
ball

we
be
incline
to
trace
his
disorder
to
that
source

<EOS>
on
the
other

there
be
a
silent
anguish
upon

too
strongly
resemble
the
result
establish
within
ourselves
by
the
sherry

to
be
discard
from
alarmed
consideration

<EOS>
again
,
we
observe
him
,
with
terror
,
to
be
much
overcome
by
our
sole
's
be
air
in
a
temporary
retreat
close
to
him

while
the

go
out
(
as
we
conceive
)
to

his

and
when

its

he
suddenly
retire
in
great
disorder

<EOS>
in
fine
,
for
the
uneatable
part
of
this
little
dinner
(
as
contradistinguish
from
the
undrinkable

we
pay
only
seven
shilling

sixpence
each

<EOS>
and
Bullfinch

<EOS>
I
agree
unanimously
,
that
no

ill

ill

cook
,
nasty
little
dinner
could
be
get
for

money
anywhere
else
under

sun

<EOS>
with
that
comfort
to
our
back
,
we
turn
them
on
the
dear
old
Temeraire
,
the
charge
Temeraire
,
and
resolve
(
in
the
Scotch
dialect
)
to
gang
nae

<EOS>
Number

:
<EOS>
Mr
Barlow
 
<EOS>
a
great
reader
of
good
fiction
at
an
unusually
early
age
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
me
as
though
I
have
be
bear
under
the
superintendence
of
the
estimable
but
terrific
gentleman
whose
name
stand
at
the
head
of
my
present
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
the
instructive
monomaniac
,
Mr
Barlow
,
will
be
remember
as
the
tutor
of
Master
Harry
Sandford
and
Master
Tommy
Merton
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
everything
,
and
didactically
improve
all
sort
of
occasion
,
from
the
consumption
of
a
plate
of
cherry
to
the
contemplation
of
a
starlight
night
.
 
<EOS>
what
youth
come
to
without
Mr
Barlow
be
display
in
the
history
of
Sandford
and
Merton
,
by
the
example
of
a
certain
awful
Master
Mash
.
 
<EOS>
this
young
wretch
wear
buckle
and
powder
,
conduct
himself
with
insupportable
levity
at
the
theatre
,
have
no
idea
of
face
a
mad
bull
single
-
handed
(
in
which
I
think
him
less
reprehensible
,
as
remotely
reflect
my
own
character
)
,
and
be
a
frightful
instance
of
the
enervate
effect
of
luxury
upon
the
human
race
.
   
<EOS>
strange
destiny
on
the
part
of
Mr
Barlow
,
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
childhood
's
experience
of
a
bore
!
 
<EOS>
Immortal
Mr
Barlow
,
bore
his
way
through
the
verdant
freshness
of
age
!
   
<EOS>
My
personal
indictment
against
Mr
Barlow
be
one
of
many
count
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
proceed
to
set
forth
a
few
of
the
injury
he
have
do
me
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
never
make
or
take
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
this
insensibility
on
Mr
Barlow
's
part
not
only
cast
its
own
gloom
over
my
boyhood
,
but
blight
even
the
sixpenny
jest
-
book
of
the
time
;
for
,
groan
under
a
moral
spell
constrain
me
to
refer
all
thing
to
Mr
Barlow
,
I
could
not
choose
but
ask
myself
in
a
whisper
when
tickle
by
a
print
jest
,
"
what
would
he
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
what
would
he
see
in
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
point
of
the
jest
immediately
become
a
sting
,
and
stung
my
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
mind
's
eye
see
him
stolid
,
frigid
,
perchance
take
from
its
shelf
some
dreary
greek
book
,
and
translate
at
full
length
what
some
dismal
sage
say
(
and
touch
up
afterwards
,
perhaps
,
for
publication
)
,
when
he
banish
some
unlucky
joker
from
Athens
.
   
<EOS>
the
incompatibility
of
Mr
Barlow
with
all
other
portion
of
my
young
life
but
himself
,
the
adamantine
inadaptability
of
the
man
to
my
favourite
fancy
and
amusement
,
be
the
thing
for
which
I
hate
him
most
.
 
<EOS>
what
right
have
he
to
bore
his
way
into
my
Arabian
Nights
?
 
<EOS>
yet
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
hint
doubt
of
the
veracity
of
Sindbad
the
Sailor
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
get
hold
of
the
Wonderful
Lamp
,
I
know
he
would
have
trim
it
and
light
it
,
and
deliver
a
lecture
over
it
on
the
quality
of
sperm
-
oil
,
with
a
glance
at
the
whale
fishery
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
so
soon
have
find
out
---
on
mechanical
principle
---
the
peg
in
the
neck
of
the
Enchanted
Horse
,
and
would
have
turn
it
the
right
way
in
so
workmanlike
a
manner
,
that
the
horse
could
never
have
get
any
height
into
the
air
,
and
the
story
could
not
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
prove
,
by
map
and
compass
,
that
there
be
no
such
kingdom
as
the
delightful
kingdom
of
Casgar
,
on
the
frontier
of
Tartary
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
cause
that
hypocritical
young
prig
Harry
to
make
an
experiment
,
---
with
the
aid
of
a
temporary
building
in
the
garden
and
a
dummy
,
---
demonstrate
that
you
could
not
let
a
choke
hunchback
down
an
eastern
chimney
with
a
cord
,
and
leave
him
upright
on
the
hearth
to
terrify
the
sultan
's
purveyor
.
   
<EOS>
the
golden
sound
of
the
overture
to
the
first
metropolitan
pantomime
,
I
remember
,
be
alloy
by
Mr
Barlow
.
 
<EOS>
Click
click
,
ting
ting
,
bang
bang
,
weedle
weedle
weedle
,
bang
!
 
<EOS>
I
recall
the
chilling
air
that
run
across
my
frame
and
cool
my
hot
delight
,
as
the
thought
occur
to
me
,
"
this
would
never
do
for
Mr
Barlow
!
"
<EOS>
after
the
curtain
draw
up
,
dreadful
doubt
of
Mr
Barlow
's
consider
the
costume
of
the
Nymphs
of
the
Nebula
as
be
sufficiently
opaque
,
obtrude
themselves
on
my
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
clown
I
perceive
two
person
;
one
a
fascinating
unaccountable
creature
of
a
hectic
complexion
,
joyous
in
spirit
though
feeble
in
intellect
,
with
flash
of
brilliancy
;
the
other
a
pupil
for
Mr
Barlow
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
how
Mr
Barlow
would
secretly
rise
early
in
the
morning
,
and
butter
the
pavement
for
HIM
,
and
,
when
he
have
bring
him
down
,
would
look
severely
out
of
his
study
window
and
ask
him
how
he
enjoy
the
fun
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
how
Mr
Barlow
would
heat
all
the
poker
in
the
house
,
and
singe
him
with
the
whole
collection
,
to
bring
him
better
acquaint
with
the
property
of
incandescent
iron
,
on
which
he
(
barlow
)
would
fully
expatiate
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
Mr
Barlow
be
institute
a
comparison
between
the
clown
's
conduct
at
his
study
,
---
drink
up
the
ink
,
lick
his
copy
-
book
,
and
use
his
head
for
blotting
-
paper
,
---
and
that
of
the
already
mention
young
prig
of
prigs
,
Harry
,
sit
at
the
barlovian
foot
,
sneakingly
pretend
to
be
in
a
rapture
of
youthful
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
how
soon
Mr
Barlow
would
smooth
the
clown
's
hair
down
,
instead
of
let
it
stand
erect
in
three
tall
tuft
;
and
how
,
after
a
couple
of
year
or
so
with
Mr
Barlow
,
he
would
keep
his
leg
close
together
when
he
walk
,
and
would
take
his
hand
out
of
his
big
loose
pocket
,
and
would
not
have
a
jump
leave
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
that
I
be
particularly
ignorant
what
most
thing
in
the
universe
be
make
of
,
and
how
they
be
make
,
be
another
of
my
charge
against
Mr
Barlow
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
dread
upon
me
of
develop
into
a
Harry
,
and
with
a
further
dread
upon
me
of
be
barlowe
if
I
make
inquiry
,
by
bring
down
upon
myself
a
cold
shower
-
bath
of
explanation
and
experiment
,
I
forbear
enlightenment
in
my
youth
,
and
become
,
as
they
say
in
melodramas
,
"
the
wreck
you
now
behold
.
<EOS>
"
that
I
consort
with
idler
and
dunce
be
another
of
the
melancholy
fact
for
which
I
hold
Mr
Barlow
responsible
.
 
<EOS>
that
pragmatical
prig
,
Harry
,
become
so
detestable
in
my
sight
,
that
,
he
be
report
studious
in
the
South
,
I
would
have
flee
idle
to
the
extremest
North
.
 
<EOS>
well
to
learn
misconduct
from
a
Master
Mash
than
science
and
statistic
from
a
Sandford
!
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
the
path
,
which
,
but
for
Mr
Barlow
,
I
may
never
have
tread
.
 
<EOS>
thought
<EOS>
I
,
with
a
shudder
,
"
Mr
Barlow
be
a
bore
,
with
an
immense
constructive
power
of
make
bore
.
 
<EOS>
His
prize
speciman
be
a
bore
.
 
<EOS>
He
seek
to
make
a
bore
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
knowledge
be
power
I
be
not
prepared
to
gainsay
;
but
,
with
Mr
Barlow
,
knowledge
be
power
to
bore
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
therefore
I
take
refuge
in
the
cave
of
ignorance
,
wherein
I
have
reside
ever
since
,
and
which
be
still
my
private
address
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
weighty
charge
of
all
my
charge
against
Mr
Barlow
be
,
that
he
still
walk
the
earth
in
various
disguise
,
seek
to
make
a
Tommy
of
me
,
even
in
my
maturity
.
 
<EOS>
irrepressible
,
instructive
monomaniac
<EOS>
,
Mr
Barlow
fill
my
life
with
pitfall
,
and
lie
hide
at
the
bottom
to
burst
out
upon
me
when
I
least
expect
him
.
   
<EOS>
a
few
of
these
dismal
experience
of
mine
shall
suffice
.
   
<EOS>
know
Mr
Barlow
to
have
invest
largely
in
the
move
panorama
trade
,
and
have
on
various
occasion
identify
him
in
the
dark
with
a
long
wand
in
his
hand
,
hold
forth
in
his
old
way
(
make
more
appalling
in
this
connection
by
his
sometimes
crack
a
piece
of
Mr
Carlyle
's
own
dead
-
Sea
fruit
in
mistake
for
a
joke
)
,
I
systematically
shun
pictorial
entertainment
on
roller
.
 
<EOS>
similarly
,
I
should
demand
responsible
bail
and
guaranty
against
the
appearance
of
Mr
Barlow
,
before
commit
myself
to
attendance
at
any
assemblage
of
my
fellow
-
creature
where
a
bottle
of
water
and
a

very

all

,
perform

<EOS>
the
Momuses
on
either
side
of
him
have
each
another
instrument
peculiar
to
the
Father
of
Waters
,
which
may
be
liken
to

there
be

all

we
have
have
several

when
the

turn

"
Bones

deliver
certain
grave
remark
to
him
concern
the
juvenile
present
,
and
the
season
of
the
year
;
<EOS>
whereon
I
perceive
that
I
be
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Barlow
---
cork
!
   
<EOS>
another
night
---
and
this
be
in
London
---
I
attend
the
representation
of
a
little
comedy
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
character
be
lifelike
(
and
consequently
not
improve
)
,
and
as
they
go
upon
their
several
way
and
design
without
personally
address
themselves
to
me
,
I
feel
rather
confident
of
come
through
it
without
be
regard
as
Tommy
,
the
more
so
,
as
we
be
clearly
get
close
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
deceive
myself
.
 
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
,
Apropos
of
nothing
,
everybody
concern
come
to
a
check
and
halt
,
advance
to
the
foot
-
light
in
a
general
rally
to
take
dead
aim
at
me
,
and
bring
me
down
with
a
moral
homily
,
in
which
I
detect
the
dread
hand
of
Barlow
.
   
<EOS>
nay
,
so
intricate
and
subtle
be
the
toil
of
this
hunter
,
that
on
the
very
next
night
after
that
,
I
be
again
entrap
,
where
no
vestige
of
a
spring
could
have
be
apprehend
by
the
timid
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
burlesque
that
I
see
perform
;
an
uncompromising
burlesque
,
where
everybody
concern
,
but
especially
the
lady
,
carry
on
at
a
very
considerable
rate
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
most
prominent
and
active
among
the
corp
of
performer
be
what
I
take
to
be
<EOS>
(
and
she
really
give
me
very
fair
opportunity
of
come
to
a
right
conclusion
)
<EOS>
a
young
lady
of
a
pretty
figure
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
dress
as
a
picturesque
young
gentleman
,
whose
pantaloon
have
be
cut
off
in
their
infancy
;
and
she
have
very
neat
knee
and
very
neat
satin
boot
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
after
singe
a
slang
song
and
dance
a
slang
dance
,
this
engaging
figure
approach
the
fatal
lamp
,
and
,
bend
over
them
,
deliver
in
a
thrilling
voice
a
random
eulogium
on
,
and
exhortation
to
pursue
,
the
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
be
my
exclamation
;
"
barlow
!
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
still
another
aspect
in
which
Mr
Barlow
perpetually
insist
on
my
sustain
the
character
of
Tommy
,
which
be
more
unendurable
yet
,
on
account
of
its
extreme
aggressiveness
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
purpose
of
a
review
or
newspaper
,
he
will
get
up
an
abstruse
subject
with
definite
pain
,
will
barlow
,
utterly
regardless
of
the
price
of
midnight
oil
,
and
indeed
of
everything
else
,
save
cram
himself
to
the
eye
.
   
<EOS>
but
mark
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Barlow
blow
his
information
off
,
he
be
not
content
with
have
ram
it
home
,
and
discharge
it
upon
me
,
Tommy
,
his
target
,
but
he
pretend
that
he
be
always
in
possession
of
it
,
and
make
nothing
of
it
,
---
that
he
imbibe
it
with
mother
's
milk
,
---
and
that
I
,
the
wretched
Tommy
,
be
most
abjectly
behindhand
in
not
have
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
,
why
be
Tommy
to
be
always
the
foil
of
Mr
Barlow
to
this
extent
?
 
<EOS>
what
Mr
Barlow
have
not
the
slight
notion
of
himself
,
a
week
ago
,
it
surely
can
not
be
any
very
heavy
backsliding
in
me
not
to
have
at
my
finger
'
end
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
and
yet
Mr
Barlow
systematically
carry
it
over
me
with
a
high
hand
,
and
will
tauntingly
ask
me
,
in
his
article
,
whether
it
be
possible
that
I
be
not
aware
that
every
school
-
boy
know
that
the
fourteenth
turn
on
the
left
in
the
steppe
of
Russia
will
conduct
to
such
and
such
a
wander
tribe
?
<EOS>
with
other
disparage
question
of
like
nature
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
Mr
Barlow
address
a
letter
to
any
journal
as
a
volunteer
correspondent
(
which
I
frequently
find
him
do
)
,
he
will
previously
have
get
somebody
to
tell
him
some
tremendous
technicality
,
and
will
write
in
the
cool
manner
,
"
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
I
may
assume
that
every
reader
of
your
column
,
possess
average
information
and
intelligence
,
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
"
---
say
that
the
draught
from
the
touch
-
hole
of
a
cannon
of
such
a
calibre
bear
such
a
proportion
in
the
nice
fraction
to
the
draught
from
the
muzzle
;
or
some
equally
familiar
little
fact
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
it
be
,
be
certain
that
it
always
tend
to
the
exaltation
of
Mr
Barlow
,
and
the
depression
of
his
enforce
and
enslave
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barlow
's
knowledge
of
my
own
pursuit
<EOS>
I
find
to
be
so
profound
,
that
my
own
knowledge
of
them
become
as
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barlow
(
disguise
and
bear
a
feign
name
,
but
detect
by
me
)
<EOS>
have
occasionally
teach
me
,
in
a
sonorous
voice
,
from
end
to
end
of
a
long
dinner
-
table
,
trifle
that
I
take
the
liberty
of
teach
him
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
My
closing
article
of
impeachment
against
Mr
Barlow
be
,
that
he
go
out
to
breakfast
,
go
out
to
dinner
,
go
out
everywhere
,
high
and
low
,
and
that
he
WILL
preach
to
me
,
and
that
I
can't
<EOS>
get
rid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
me
a
Promethean
Tommy
,
bind
;
and
he
be
the
vulture
that
gorge
itself
upon
the
liver
of
my
uninstructed
mind
.
    
<EOS>
Number
34
:
on
an
amateur
beat
 
It
be
one
of
my
fancy
,
that
even
my
idle
walk
must
always
have
its
appoint
destination
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
myself
a
task
before
I
leave
my
lodging
in
covent
-
garden
on
a
street
expedition
,
and
should
no
more
think
of
alter
my
route
by
the
way
,
or
turn
back
and
leave
a
part
of
it
unachieved
,
than
I
should
think
of
fraudulently
violate
an
agreement
enter
into
with
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
day
,
find
myself
under
this
kind
of
obligation
to
proceed
to
Limehouse
,
I
start
punctually
at
noon
,
in
compliance
with
the
term
of
the
contract
with
myself
to
which
my
good
faith
be
pledge
.
   
<EOS>
on
such
an
occasion
,
it
be
my
habit
to
regard
my
walk
as
my
beat
,
and
myself
as
a
high
sort
of
police
-
constable
do
duty
on
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
a
ruffian
in
the
street
whom
I
mentally
collar
and
clear
out
of
them
,
who
would
see
mighty
little
of
London
,
I
can
tell
him
,
if
I
could
deal
with
him
physically
.
   
<EOS>
issue
forth
upon
this
very
beat
,
and
follow
with
my
eye
three
hulking
garrotter
on
their
way
home
,
---
which
home
I
could
confidently
swear
to
be
within
so
many
yard
of
Drury
-
lane
,
in
such
a
narrow
and
restricted
direction
(
though
they
live
in
their
lodging
quite
as
undisturbed
as
I
in
mine
)
<EOS>
,
---
I
go
on
duty
with
a
consideration
which
I
respectfully
offer
to
the
new
Chief
Commissioner
,
---
in
whom
I
thoroughly
confide
as
a
try
and
efficient
public
servant
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
(
think
I
)
<EOS>
have
I
be
force
to
swallow
,
in
police
-
report
,
the
intolerable
stereotyped
pill
of
nonsense
,
how
that
the
police
-
constable
inform
the
worthy
magistrate
how
that
the
associate
of
the
prisoner
do
,
at
that
present
speak
,
dwell
in
a
street
or
court
which
no
man
dare
go
down
,
and
how
that
the
worthy
magistrate
have
hear
of
the
dark
reputation
of
such
street
or
court
,
and
how
that
our
reader
would
doubtless
remember
that
it
be
always
the
same
street
or
court
which
be
thus
edifyingly
discourse
about
,
say
once
a
fortnight
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
suppose
that
a
Chief
Commissioner
send
round
a
circular
to
every
division
of
police
employ
in
London
,
require
instantly
the
name
in
all
district
of
all
such
much
-
puff
street
or
court
which
no
man
durst
go
down
;
and
suppose
that
in
such
circular
he
give
plain
warning
,
"
if
those
place
really
exist
,
they
be
a
proof
of
police
inefficiency
which
I
mean
to
punish
;
and
if
they
do
not
exist
,
but
be
a
conventional
fiction
,
then
they
be
a
proof
of
lazy
tacit
police
connivance
with
professional
crime
,
which
I
also
mean
to
punish
"
---
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
fiction
or
reality
,
could
they
survive
the
touchstone
of
this
atom
of
common
sense
?
 
<EOS>
to
tell
us
in
open
court
,
until
it
have
become
as
trite
a
feature
of
news
as
the
great
gooseberry
,
that
a
costly
police
-
system
such
as
be
never
before
hear
of
,
have
leave
in
London
,
in
the
day
of
steam
and
gas
and
photograph
of
thief
and
electric
telegraph
,
the
sanctuary
and
stew
of
the
Stuarts
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
a
parity
of
practice
,
in
all
department
,
would
bring
back
the
Plague
in
two
summer
,
and
the
Druids
in
a
century
!
   
<EOS>
walk
faster
under
my
share
of
this
public
injury
,
I
overturn
a
wretched
little
creature
,
who
,
clutch
at
the
rag
of
a
pair
of
trouser
with
one
of
its
claws
,
and
at
its
ragged
hair
with
the
other
,
patter
with
bare
foot
over
the
muddy
stone
.
 
<EOS>
I
stop
to
raise
and
succour
this
poor
weeping
wretch
,
and
fifty
like
it
,
but
of
both
sex
,
be
about
me
in
a
moment
,
beg
,
tumble
,
fighting
,
clamouring
,
yelling
,
shiver
in
their
nakedness
and
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
the
piece
of
money
I
have
put
into
the
claw
of
the
child
I
have
over
-
turn
be
claw
out
of
it
,
and
be
again
claw
out
of
that
wolfish
gripe
,
and
again
out
of
that
,
and
soon
I
have
no
notion
in
what
part
of
the
obscene
scuffle
in
the
mud
,
of
rag
and
leg
and
arm
and
dirt
,
the
money
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
in
raise
the
child
,
I
have
draw
it
aside
out
of
the
main
thoroughfare
,
and
this
take
place
among
some
wooden
hoarding
and
barrier
and
ruin
of
demolish
building
,
hard
by
Temple
Bar
.
   
<EOS>
unexpectedly
,
from
among
them
emerge
a
genuine
police
-
constable
,
before
whom
the
dreadful
brood
disperse
in
various
direction
,
he
make
feint
and
dart
in
this
direction
and
in
that
,
and
catch
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
when
all
be
frighten
away
,
he
take
off
his
hat
,
pull
out
a
handkerchief
from
it
,
wipe
his
heated
brow
,
and
restore
the
handkerchief
and
hat
to
their
place
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
have
discharge
a
great
moral
duty
,
---
as
indeed
he
have
,
in
do
what
be
set
down
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
,
and
I
look
about
at
the
disorderly
trace
in
the
mud
,
and
I
think
of
the
drop
of
rain
and
the
footprint
of
an
extinct
creature
,
hoary
age
upon
age
old
,
that
geologist
have
identify
on
the
face
of
a
cliff
;
and
this
speculation
come
over
me
:
 
<EOS>
if
this
mud
could
petrify
at
this
moment
,
and
could
lie
conceal
here
for
ten
thousand
year
,
I
wonder
whether
the
race
of
man
then
to
be
our
successor
on
the
earth
could
,
from
these
or
any
mark
,
by
the
utmost
force
of
the
human
intellect
,
unassiste
by
tradition
,
deduce
such
an
astounding
inference
as
the
existence
of
a
polished
state
of
society
that
bear
with
the
public
savagery
of
neglect
child
in
the
street
of
its
capital
city
,
and
be
proud
of
its
power
by
sea
and
land
,
and
never
use
its
power
to
seize
and
save
them
!
   
<EOS>
after
this
,
when
I
come
to
the
Old
Bailey
and
glance
up
it
towards
Newgate
,
I
find
that
the
prison
have
an
inconsistent
look
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
some
unlucky
inconsistency
in
the
atmosphere
that
day
;
for
though
the
proportion
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
be
very
beautiful
,
it
have
an
air
of
be
somewhat
out
of
drawing
,
in
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
though
the
cross
be
too
high
up
,
and
perch
upon
the
intervene
golden
ball
too
far
away
.

I

round

come
suddenly
on
an
apparition
familiar
to
London
street
afar
off

<EOS>
what
London
peripatetic

have
not
see
the

who
have
fall
forward

double
,
through
some
affection

whose

of

take

to

so
that
it

<EOS>
who
do
not
know
her

and
her
shawl

and
her
basket
,
as
she
grope
her

along

capable
of
see
nothing
but
the
pavement
,
never
beg
,
never
stop

for
ever
go
somewhere
on
no
business
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
she
live
,
whence
do
she
come
,
whither
do
she
go
,
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
I
mind
the
time
when
her
yellow
arm
be
naught
but
bone
and
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
slight
change
steal
over
her

for
there
be
a
shadowy
suggestion
of
human

on

<EOS>
the
Strand
may
be
take
as
the
central

about

she
revolve

mile

how
come
she
so
far
east
as
this
?
 
<EOS>

come

<EOS>
have
be
how
much
farther
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
rare
spectacle
in

<EOS>
I
receive
intelligent
information
to
this
effect
from
a
dog
---
a
lop
-
sided
mongrel
with
a
foolish
tail
,
plod
along
with
his
tail
up
,
and
his
ear
prick
,
and
display
an
amiable
interest
in
the
way
of
his
fellow

man
,
---
if
I
may
be
allow
the
expression
.
 
<EOS>
after
pause
at
a
pork
-
shop
,
he
be
jog
eastward
like
myself
,
with
a
benevolent
countenance
and
a
watery
mouth
,
as
though
muse
on
the
many
excellence
of
pork
,
when
he
behold
this
double

up
bundle
approach
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
much
astonish
at
the
bundle
(
though
amazed
by
that
)
,
as
the
circumstance
that
it
have
within
itself
the
mean
of
locomotion
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
,
prick
his
ear
high
,
make
a
slight
point
,
stare
,
utter
a
short
,
low
growl
,
and
glisten
at
the
nose
,
---
as
I
conceive
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
the
bundle
continue
to
approach
,
he
bark
,
turn
tail
,
and
be
about
to
fly
,
when
,
argue
with
himself
that
flight
be
not
become
in
a
dog
,
he
turn
,
and
once
more
face
the
advance
heap
of
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
after
much
hesitation
,
it
occur
to
him
that
there
may
be
a
face
in
it
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
desperately
resolve
to
undertake
the
adventure
,
and
pursue
the
inquiry
,
he
go
slowly
up
to
the
bundle
,
go
slowly
round
it
,
and
come
at
length
upon
the
human
countenance
down
there
where
never
human
countenance
should
be
,
give
a
yelp
of
horror
,
and
fly
for
the
East
India
Docks
.
   
<EOS>
be
now
in
the
Commercial
Road
district
of
my
beat
,
and
bethink
myself
that
Stepney
Station
be
near
,
I
quicken
my
pace
that
I
may
turn
out
of
the
road
at
that
point
,
and
see
how
my
small
eastern
star
be
shine
.
   
<EOS>
the
Children

,
to
which
I
give

be
in
full
force
.
 
<EOS>
all
its

be
occupy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
new
face
on
the
bed
where
my
pretty
baby
lie
,
and
that
sweet
little
child
be
now
at
rest
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
much
kind
sympathy
have
be
here
since
my
former
visit
,
and
it
be
good
to
see
the
wall
profusely
garnish
with
doll
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
Poodles
may
think
of
them
,
as
they
stretch
out
their
arm
above
the
bed
,
and
stare
,
and
display
their
splendid
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Poodles
have
a
great
interest
in
the
patient
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
make
the
round
of
the
bed
,
like
a
house
-
surgeon
,
attend
by
another
dog
,
---
a
friend
,
---
who
appear
to
trot
about
with
him
in
the
character
of
his
pupil
dresser
.
 
<EOS>
Poodles
be
anxious
to
make
me
known
to
a
pretty
little
girl
look
wonderfully
healthy
,
who
have
have
a
leg
take
off
for
cancer
of
the
knee
.
 
<EOS>
a
difficult
operation
,
Poodles
intimate
,
wag
his
tail
on
the
counterpane
,
but
perfectly
successful
,
as
you
see
,
dear
sir
!
 
<EOS>
the
patient
,
pat
Poodles
,
add
with
a
smile
,
"
the
leg
be
so
much
trouble
to
me
,
that
I
be
glad
it
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
anything
in
doggery
fine
than
the
deportment
of
Poodles
,
when
another
little
girl
open
her
mouth
to
show
a
peculiar
enlargement
of
the
tongue
.
<EOS>
Poodles
(
at
that
time
on
a
table
,
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
occasion
)
look
at
the
tongue
(
with
his
own
sympathetically
out
)
<EOS>
so
very
gravely
and
knowingly
,
that
I
feel
inclined
to
put
my
hand
in
my
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
and
give
him
a
guinea
,
wrap
in
paper
.
   
<EOS>
on
my
beat
again
,
and
close
to
Limehouse
Church
,
its
termination
,
I
find
myself
near
to
certain
"
Lead
-
Mills
.
"
 
<EOS>
strike
by
the
name
,
which
be
fresh
in
my
memory
,
and
find
,
on
inquiry
,
that
these
same
lead
-
mill
be
identify
with
those
same
lead
-
mill
of
which
I
make
mention
when
I
first
visit
the
East
London
Children
's
Hospital
and
its
neighbourhood
as
Uncommercial
Traveller
,
I
resolve
to
have
a
look
at
them
.
   
<EOS>
receive
by
two
very
intelligent
gentleman
,
brother
,
and
partner
with
their
father
in
the
concern
,
and
who
testify
every
desire
to
show
their
work
to
me
freely
<EOS>
,
I
go
over
the
lead
-
mill
.
 
<EOS>
the
purport
of
such
work
be
the
conversion
of
pig
-
lead
into
white
-
lead
.
<EOS>
this
conversion
be
bring
about
by
the
slow
and
gradual
effecting
of
certain
successive
chemical
change
in
the
lead
itself
.
 
<EOS>
the
process
be
picturesque
and
interesting
,
---
the
most
so
,
be
the
burying
of
the
lead
,
at
a
certain
stage
of
preparation
,
in
pot
,
each
pot
contain
a
certain
quantity
of
acid
besides
,
and
all
the
pot
be
bury
in
vast
number
,
in
layer
,
under
tan
,
for
some
ten
week
.
   
<EOS>
hop
up
ladder
,
and
across
plank
,
and
on
elevated
perch
,
until
I
be
uncertain
whether
to
liken
myself
to
a
bird
or
a
brick
-
layer
,
I
become
conscious
of
stand
on
nothing
particular
,
look
down
into
one
of
a
series
of
large
cockloft
,
with
the
outer
day
peep
in
through
the
chink
in
the
tile
roof
above
.
 
<EOS>
a
number
of
woman
be
ascend
to
,
and
descend
from
,
this
cockloft
,
each
carry
on
the
upward
journey
a
pot
of
prepared
lead
and
acid
,
for
deposition
under
the
smoking
tan
.
 
<EOS>
when
one
layer
of
pot
be
completely
fill
,
it
be
carefully
cover
in
with
plank
,
and
those
be
carefully
cover
with
tan
again
,
and
then
another
layer
of
pot
be
begin
above
;
sufficient
mean
of
ventilation
be
preserve
through
wooden
tube
.
 
<EOS>
go
down
into
the
cockloft
then
fill
<EOS>
,
I
find
the
heat
of
the
tan
to
be
surprisingly
great
,
and
also
the
odour
of
the
lead
and
acid
to
be
not
absolutely
exquisite
,
though
I
believe
not
noxious
at
that
stage
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
cockloft
,
where
the
pot
be
be
exhume
,
the
heat
of
the
steam
tan
be
much
great
,
and
the
smell
be
penetrate
and
peculiar
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
cockloft
in
all
stage
;
full
and
empty
,
half
fill
and
half
emptied
;
strong
,
active
woman
be
clamber
about
them
busily
;
and
the
whole
thing
have
rather
the
air
of
the
upper
part
of
the
house
of
some
immensely
rich
old
Turk
,
whose
faithful
seraglio
be
hide
his
money
because
the
sultan
or
the
pasha
be
come
.
   
<EOS>
as
be
the
case
with
most
pulps
or
pigment
,
so
in
the
instance
of
this
white
-
lead
,
process
of
stirring
,
separating
,
washing
,
grind
,
rolling
,
and
press
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
be
unquestionably
inimical
to
health
,
the
danger
arise
from
inhalation
of
particle
of
lead
,
or
from
contact
between
the
lead
and
the
touch
,
or
both
.
 
<EOS>
against
these
danger
,
I
find
good
respirator
provide
(
simply
make
of
flannel
and
muslin
,
so
as
to
be
inexpensively
renew
,
and
in
some
instance
wash
with
scent
soap
)
,
and
gauntlet
glove
,
and
loose
gown
.
 
<EOS>
everywhere
,
there
be
as
much
fresh
air
as
window
,
well
place
and
open
,
could
possibly
admit
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
explain
that
the
precaution
of
frequently
change
the
woman
employ
in
the
bad
part
of
the
work
(
a
precaution
originate
in
their
own
experience
or
apprehension
of
its
ill
effect
)
be
find
salutary
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
mysterious
and
singular
appearance
,
with
the
mouth
and
nose
cover
,
and
the
loose
gown
on
,
and
yet
bear
out
the
simile
of
the
old
Turk
and
the
seraglio
all
the
well
for
the
disguise
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
this
vexed
white
-
lead
,
have
be
bury
and
resuscitate
,
and
heated
and
cool
and
stir
,
and
separate
and
wash
and
ground
,
and
roll
and
press
,
be
subject
to
the
action
of
intense
fiery
heat
.
 
<EOS>
a
row
of
woman
,
dress
as
above
describe
,
stand
,
let
us
say
,
in
a
large
stone
bakehouse
,
pass
on
the
baking
-
dish
as
they
be
give
out
by
the
cook
,
from
hand
to
hand
,
into
the
oven
.
 
<EOS>
the
oven
,
or
stove
,
cold
as
yet
,
look
as
high
as
an
ordinary
house
,
and
be
full
of
man
and
woman
on
temporary
foothold
,
briskly
pass
up
and
stow
away
the
dish
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
of
another
oven
,
or
stove
,
about
to
be
cool
and
empty
,
be
open
from
above
,
for
the
uncommercial
countenance
to
peer
down
into
.
 
<EOS>
the
uncommercial
countenance
withdraw
itself
,
with
expedition
and
a
sense
of
suffocation
,
from
the
dull
-
glow
heat
and
the
overpower
smell
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
perhaps
the
go
into
these
stove
to
work
,
when
they
be
freshly
open
,
may
be
the
bad
part
of
the
occupation
.
   
<EOS>
but
I
make
it
out
to
be
indubitable
that
the
owner
of
these
lead
-
mill
honestly
and
sedulously
try
to
reduce
the
danger
of
the
occupation
to
the
low
point
.
   
<EOS>
a
washing
-
place
be
provide
for
the
woman
<EOS>
(
I
think
there
may
have
be
more
towel
)
,
and
a
room
in
which
they
hang
their
clothe
,
and
take
their
meal
,
and
where
they
have
a
good
fire
-
range
and
fire
,
and
a
female
attendant
to
help
them
,
and
to
watch
that
they
do
not
neglect
the
cleansing
of
their
hand
before
touch
their
food
.
 
<EOS>
an
experienced
medical
attendant
be
provide
for
them
,
and
any
premonitory
symptom
of
lead
-
poisoning
be
carefully
treat
.
 
<EOS>
Their
teapot
and
such
thing
be
set
out
on
table
ready
for
their
afternoon
meal
,
when
I
see
their
room
;
and
it
have
a
homely
look
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
find
that
they
bear
the
work
much
better
than
man
:
 
<EOS>
some
few
of
them
have
be
at
it
for
year
,
and
the
great
majority
of
those
I
observe
be
strong
and
active
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
it
should
be
remember
that
most
of
them
be
very
capricious
and
irregular
in
their
attendance
.
   
<EOS>
american
inventiveness
would
seem
to
indicate
that
before
very
long
white
-
lead
may
be
make
entirely
by
machinery
.
 
<EOS>
the
sooner
,
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
part
from
my
two
frank
conductor
over
the
mill
,
by
tell
them
that
they
have
nothing
there
to
be
conceal
,
and
nothing
to
be
blame
for
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
rest
,
the
philosophy
of
the
matter
of
lead
-
poisoning
and
workpeople
seem
to
me
to
have
be
pretty
fairly
sum
up
by
the
Irishwoman
whom
I
quote
in
my
former
paper
:
 
"
some
of
them
get
lead
-
pisone
soon
,
and
some
of
them
get
lead
-
pisone
later
,
and
some
,
but
not
many
,
niver
;
and

a
Fly

Leaf
in
a
life
 
once
upon
a
time
(
no
matter
when
)
,
I
be
engage
in
a
pursuit
<EOS>
(
no
matter
what
)
,
which
could
be
transact
by
myself
alone
;
in
which
I
could
have
no
help
;
which
impose
a
constant
strain
on
the
attention
,
memory
,
observation
,
and
physical
power
;
and
which
involve
an
almost
fabulous
amount
of
change
of
place
and
rapid
railway
travelling
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
follow
this
pursuit
through
an
exceptionally
try
winter
in
an
always
try
climate
,
and
have
resume
it
in
England
after
but
a
brief
repose
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
be
prolong
until
,
at
length
---
and
,
as
it
seem
,
all
of
a
sudden
---
it
so
wear
me
out
that
I
could
not
rely
,
with
my
usual
cheerful
confidence
,
upon
myself
to
achieve
the
constantly
recur
task
,
and
begin
to
feel
(
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
)
giddy
,
jarred
,
shaken
,
faint
,
uncertain
of
voice
and
sight
and
tread
and
touch
,
and
dull
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
the
medical
advice
I
seek
within
a
few
hour
,
be
give
in
two
word
:
 
"
instant
rest

"
 
<EOS>
be
accustomed
to
observe
myself
as
curiously
as
if
I
be
another
man
,
and
know
the
advice
to
meet
my
only
need
,
I
instantly
halt
in
the
pursuit
of
which
I
speak
,
and
rest
.
   
<EOS>
My
intention
be
,
to
interpose
,
as
it
be
,
a
fly
-
leaf
in
the
book
of
my
life
,
in
which
nothing
should
be
write
from
without
for
a
brief
season
of
a
few
week
.
 
<EOS>
but
some
very
singular
experience
record
themselves
on
this
same
fly
-
leaf
,
and
I
be
go
to
relate
them
literally
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
word
:
 
literally
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
odd
experience
be
of
the
remarkable
coincidence
between
my
case
,
in
the
general
mind
,
and
one
Mr
Merdle
's
as
I
find
it
record
in
a
work
of
fiction
call
LITTLE
DORRIT
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Mr
Merdle
be
a
swindler
,
forger
,
and
thief
,
and
my
calling
have
be
of
a
less
harmful
(
and
less
remunerative
)
nature
;
but
it
be
all
one
for
that
.
   
<EOS>
here
be
Mr
Merdle
's
case
:
   
<EOS>
"
at
first
,
he
be
dead
of
all
the
disease
that
ever
be
know
,
and
of
several
bran
-
new
malady
invent
with
the
speed
of
light
to
meet
the
demand
of
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
conceal
a
dropsy
from
infancy
,
he
have
inherit
a
large
estate
of
water
on
the
chest
from
his
grandfather
,
he
have
have
an
operation
perform
upon
him
every
morning
of
his
life
for
eighteen
year
,
he
have
be
subject
to
the
explosion
of
important
vein
in
his
body
after
the
manner
of
firework
,
he
have
have
something
the
matter
with
his
lung
,
he
have
have
something
the
matter
with
his
heart
,
he
have
have
something
the
matter
with
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
five
hundred
people
who
sit
down
to
breakfast
entirely
uninformed
on
the
whole
subject
,
believe
before
they
have
do
breakfast
,
that
they
privately
and
personally
know
Physician
to
have
say
to
Mr
Merdle
,
"
You
must
expect
to
go
out
,
some
day
,
like
the
snuff
of
a
candle
;
"
and
that
they
know
Mr
Merdle
to
have
say
to
Physician
,
"
a
man
can
die
but
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
about
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
,
something
the
matter
with
the
brain
,
become
the
favourite
theory
against
the
field
;
and
by
twelve
the
something
have
be
distinctly
ascertain
to
be
"
Pressure
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
pressure
be
so
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
public
mind
,
and
seem
to
make
every
one
so
comfortable
,
that
it
may
have
last
all
day
but
for
Bar
's
have
take
the
real
state
of
the
case
into
Court
at
half
-
past
nine
.
 
<EOS>
Pressure
,
however
,
so
far
from
be
overthrow
by
the
discovery
,
become
a
great
favourite
than
ever
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
moralising
upon
Pressure
,
in
every
street
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
people
who
have
try
to
make
money
and
have
not
be
able
to
do
it
,
say
,
there
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
You
no
sooner
begin
to
devote
yourself
to
the
pursuit
of
wealth
,
than
you
get
pressure
.
 
<EOS>
the
idle
people
improve
the
occasion
in
a
similar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
say
they
,
what
you
bring
yourself
to
by
work
,
work
,
work
!
 
<EOS>
You
persist
in
work
,
you
overdo
it
,
Pressure
come
on
,
and
you
be
do
for
!
<EOS>
this
consideration
be
very
potent
in
many
quarter
,
but
nowhere
more
so
than
among
the
young
clerk
and
partner
who
have
never
be
in
the
slight
danger
of
overdo
it
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
one
and
all
declare
,
quite
piously
,
that
they
hope
they
would
never
forget
the
warning
as
long
as
they
live
,
and
that
their
conduct
may
be
so
regulated
as
to
keep
off
pressure
,
and
preserve
them
,
a
comfort
to
their
friend
,
for
many
year
.
"
   
<EOS>
just
my
case
---
if
I
have
only
know
it
---
when
I
be
quietly
bask
in
the
sunshine
in
my
kentish
meadow
!
   
<EOS>
but
while
I
so
rest
,
thankfully
recover
every
hour
,
I
have
experience
more
odd
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
experience
of
spiritual
conceit
,
for
which
,
as
give
me
a
new
warning
against
that
curse
of
mankind
,
I
shall
always
feel
grateful
to
the
supposition
that
I
be
too
far
go
to
protest
against
play
sick
lion
to
any
stray
donkey
with
an
itch
hoof
.
 
<EOS>
all
sort
of
people
seem
to
become
vicariously
religious
at
my
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
receive
the
most
uncompromising
warning
that
I
be
a
Heathen
:
 
on
the
conclusive
authority
of
a
field
preacher
,
who
,
like
the
most
of
his
ignorant
and
vain
and
daring
class
,
could
not
construct
a
tolerable
sentence
in
his
native
tongue
or
pen
a
fair
letter
.
 
<EOS>
this
inspire
individual
call
me
to
order
roundly
,
and
know
in
the
free
and
easy
way
where
I
be
go
to
,
and
what
would
become
of
me
if
I
fail
to
fashion
myself
on
his
bright
example
,
and
be
on
term
of
blasphemous
confidence
with
the
Heavenly
Host
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
secret
of
my
heart
,
and
in
the
low
sounding
of
my
soul
---
he
!
---
and
could
read
the
depth
of
my
nature
better
than
his
A
b
c
,
and
could
turn
me
inside
out
,
like
his
own
clammy
glove
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
far
more
extraordinary
than
this
---
for
such
dirty
water
as
this
could
alone
be
draw
from
such
a
shallow
and
muddy
source
<EOS>
---
I
find
from
the
information
of
a
benefice
clergyman
,
of
whom
I
never
hear
and
whom
I
never
see
,
that
I
have
not
,
as
I
rather
suppose
I
have
,
live
a
life
of
some
reading
,
contemplation
,
and
inquiry
;
that
I
have
not
study
,
as
I
rather
suppose
I
have
,
to
inculcate
some
christian
lesson
in
book
;
that
I
have
never
try
,
as
I
rather
suppose
I
have
,
to
turn
a
child
or
two
tenderly
towards
the
knowledge
and
love
of
our
Saviour
;
that
I
have
never
have
,
as
I
rather
suppose
I
have
have
,
depart
friend
,
or
stand
beside
open
grave
;
but
that
I
have
live
a
life
of
"
uninterrupted
prosperity
,
"
and
that
I
need
this
"
check
,
overmuch
,
"
and
that
the
way
to
turn
it
to
account
be
to
read
these
sermon
and
these
poem
,
enclose
,
and
write
and
issue
by
my
correspondent
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
it
may
be
understand
that
I
relate
fact
of
my
own
uncommercial
experience
,
and
no
vain
imagining
.
 
<EOS>
the
document
in
proof
lie
near
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
another
odd
entry
on
the
fly
-
leaf
,
of
a
more
entertaining
character
,
be
the
wonderful
persistency
with
which
kind
sympathiser
assume
that
I
have
injuriously
couple
with
the
so
suddenly
relinquish
pursuit
,
those
personal
habit
of
mine
most
obviously
incompatible
with
it
,
and
most
plainly
impossible
of
be
maintain

along
with
it

as
,
all
that
exercise

all

cold

uphill

usually
carry
about

flaming
row

thousand

<EOS>
this
assuming
of
a
whole
case
against
all
fact
and
likelihood
,
strike
me
as
particularly
droll
,
and
be
an
oddity
of
which
I
certainly
have
have
no
adequate
experience
in
life

I
turn
that
curious

Heaven

,
crane
out
,
have
the
satisfaction
of
behold
it
advance
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
teetotal
procession
,
as
I
learn
from
its
banner
,
and
be
long
enough
to
consume
twenty
minute
in
pass
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
number
of
child
in
it
,
some
of
them
so
very
young
in
their
mother
'
arm
as
to
be
in
the
act
of
practically
exemplify
their
abstinence
from
ferment
liquor
,
and
attachment
to
an
unintoxicating
drink
,
while
the
procession
defile
.
 
<EOS>
the
display
be
,
on
the
whole
,
pleasant
to
see
,
as
any
good
-
humoured
holiday
assemblage
of
clean
,
cheerful
,
and
well
-
conduct
people
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bright
with
ribbon
,
tinsel
,
and
shoulder
-
belt
,
and
abound
in
flower
,
as
if
those
latter
trophy
have
come
up
in
profusion
under
much
watering
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
breezy
,
the
insubordination
of
the
large
banner
be
very
reprehensible
.
 
<EOS>
each
of
these
be
bear
aloft
on
two
pole
and
stay
with
some
half
-
dozen
line
,
be
carry
,
as
polite
book
in
the
last
century
use
to
be
write
,
by
"
various
hand
,
"
and
the
anxiety
express
in
the
upturned
face
of
those
officer
,
---
something
between
the
anxiety
attendant
on
the
balance
art
,
and
that
inseparable
from
the
pastime
of
kite
-
fly
,
with
a
touch
of
the
angler
's
quality
in
land
his
scaly
prey
,
---
much
impress
me
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
too
,
a
banner
would
shiver
in
the
wind
,
and
go
about
in
the
most
inconvenient
manner
.
 
<EOS>
this
always
happen
oftenest
with
such
gorgeous
standard
as
those
represent
a
gentleman
in
black
,
corpulent
with
tea
and
water
,
in
the
laudable
act
of
summarily
reform
a
family
,
feeble
and
pinch
with
beer
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
in
black
distend
by
wind
would
then
conduct
himself
with
the
most
unbecoming
levity
,
while
the
beery
family
,
grow
beery
,
would
frantically
try
to
tear
themselves
away
from
his
ministration
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
inscription
accompany
the
banner
be
of
a
highly
determine
character
,
as
"
We
never
,
never
will
give
up
the
temperance
cause
,
"
with
similar
sound
resolution
rather
suggestive
to
the
profane
mind
of
Mrs
Micawber
's
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
,
"
and
of
Mr
Micawber
's
retort
,
"
really
,
my
dear
,
I
be
not
aware
that
you
be
ever
require
by
any
human
being
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
interval
,
a
gloom
would
fall
on
the
pass
member
of
the
procession
,
for
which
I
be
at
first
unable
to
account
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
discover
,
after
a
little
observation
,
to
be
occasion
by
the
come
on
of
the
executioner
,
---
the
terrible
official
being
who
be
to
make
the
speech
by
-
and
-
by
,
---
who
be
distribute
in
open
carriage
at
various
point
of
the
cavalcade
.
 
<EOS>
a
dark
cloud
and
a
sensation
of
dampness
,
as
from
many
wet
blanket
,
invariably
precede
the
rolling
on
of
the
dreadful
car
contain
these
headsman
;
and
I
notice
that
the
wretched
people
who
closely
follow
them
,
and
who
be
in
a
manner
force
to
contemplate
their
fold
arm
,
complacent
countenance
,
and
threatening
lip
,
be
more
overshadow
by
the
cloud
and
damp
than
those
in
front
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
perceive
in
some
of
these
<EOS>
so
moody
an
implacability
towards
the
magnate
of
the
scaffold
,
and
so
plain
a
desire
to
tear
them
limb
from
limb
,
that
I
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
manager
the
expediency
of
convey
the
executioner
to
the
scene
of
their
dismal
labour
by
unfrequented
way
,
and
in
closely
-
tilt
cart
,
next
Whitsuntide
.
   
<EOS>
the
procession
be
compose
of
a
series
of
small
procession
,
which
have
come
together
,
each
from
its
own
metropolitan
district
.
<EOS>
an
infusion
of
allegory
become
perceptible
when
patriotic
Peckham
advance
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
judge
,
from
the
circumstance
of
Peckham
's
unfurl
a
silken
banner
that
fan
heaven
and
earth
with
the
word
,
"
the
Peckham
Lifeboat
.
"
 
<EOS>
no
boat
be
in
attendance
,
though
life
,
in
the
likeness
of
"
a
gallant
,
gallant
crew
,
"
in
nautical
uniform
,
follow
the
flag
,
I
be
lead
to
meditate
on
the
fact
that
Peckham
be
describe
by
geographer
as
an
inland
settlement
,
with
no
large
or
near
shore
-
line
than
the
towing
-
path
of
the
Surrey
Canal
,
on
which
stormy
station
I
have
be
give
to
understand
no
lifeboat
exist
.
 
<EOS>
thus
I
deduce
an
allegorical
meaning
,
and
come
to
the
conclusion
,
that
if
patriotic
Peckham
pick
a
peck
of
pickle
poetry
,
this
be
the
peck
of
pickle
poetry
which
patriotic
Peckham
pick
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
observe
that
the
aggregate
procession
be
on
the
whole
pleasant
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
use
of
that
qualified
expression
with
a
direct
meaning
,
which
I
will
now
explain
.
 
<EOS>
It
involve
the
title
of
this
paper
,
and
a
little
fair
trying
of
teetotalism
by
its
own
test
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
people
on
foot
,
and
many
people
in
vehicle
of
various
kind
.
 
<EOS>
the
former
be
pleasant
to
see
,
and
the
latter
be
not
pleasant
to
see
;
for
the
reason
that
I
never
,
on
any
occasion
or
under
any
circumstance
,
have
behold
heavy
overloading
of
horse
than
in
this
public
show
.
 
<EOS>
unless
the
imposition
of
a
great
van
laden
with
from
ten
to
twenty
people
on
a
single
horse
be
a
moderate
tasking
of
the
poor
creature
,
then
the
temperate
use
of
horse
be
immoderate
and
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
small
and
light
horse
to
the
large
and
heavy
,
there
be
many
instance
in
which
the
beast
of
burden
be
so
shamefully
overladen
,
that
the
Society
for
the
Prevention
of
Cruelty
to
animal
have
frequently
interpose
in
less
gross
case
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
always
hold
that
there
may
be
,
and
that
there
unquestionably
be
,
such
a
thing
as
use
without
abuse
,
and
that
therefore
the
total
abolitionist
be
irrational
and
wrong
-
head
.
<EOS>
but
the
procession
completely
convert
me
.
 
<EOS>
for
so
large
a
number
of
the
people
use
draught
-
horse
in
it
be
so
clearly
unable
to
use
them
without
abuse
them
,
that
I
perceive
total
abstinence
from
horseflesh
to
be
the
only
remedy
of
which
the
case
admit
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
all
one
to
teetotaler
whether
you
take
half
a
pint
of
beer
or
half
a
gallon
,
so
it
be
all
one
here
whether
the
beast
of
burden
be
a
pony
or
a
cart
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
case
have
the
special
strength
that
the
half
-
pint
quadrupe
underwent
as
much
suffering
as
the
half
-
gallon
quadrupe
.
 
<EOS>
Moral
:
 
total
abstinence
from
horseflesh
through
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
scale
.
<EOS>
this
pledge
will
be
in
course
of
administration
to
all
teetotal
processionist
,
not
pedestrian
,
at
the
publishing
office
of
"
all
the
Year
Round
,
"
on
the
1st
day
of
April
,
1870
.
   
<EOS>
observe
a
point
for
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
this
procession
comprise
many
person
in
their
gig
,
brougham
,
tax
-
cart
,
barouche
,
chaise
,
and
what
not
,
who
be
merciful
to
the
dumb
beast
that
draw
them
,
and
do
not
overcharge
their
strength
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
with
those
unoffending
person
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
run
amuck
and
vilify
and
defame
them
,
as
teetotal
tract
and
platform
would
most
assuredly
do
,
if
the
question
be
one
of
drinking
instead
of
drive
:
 
I
merely
ask
what
be
to
be
do
with
them
!
 
<EOS>
the
reply
admit
of
no
dispute
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
manifestly
,
in
strict
accordance
with
teetotal
doctrine
,
they
must
come
in
too
,
and
take
the
total
abstinence
from
horseflesh
pledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
pretend
that
those
member
of
the
procession
misuse
certain
auxiliary
which
in
most
country
and
all
age
have
be
bestow
upon
man
for
his
use
,
but
it
be
undeniable
that
other
member
of
the
procession
do
.
 
<EOS>
teetotal
mathematic
demonstrate
that
the
less
include
the
great
;
that
the
guilty
include
the
innocent
,
the
blind
the
seeing
,
the
deaf
<EOS>
the
hearing
,
the
dumb
the
speaking
<EOS>
,
the
drunken
the
sober
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
of
the
moderate
user
of
draught
-
cattle
in
question
should
deem
that
there
be
any
gentle
violence
do
to
their
reason
by
these
element
of
logic
,
they
be
invite
to
come
out
of
the
procession
next
Whitsuntide
,
and
look
at
it
from
my
window
.
