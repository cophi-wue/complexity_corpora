CHAPTER
I.
AN
enemy
in
a
treeone
afternoon
in
early
spring
,
Jack
Carleton
,
a
sturdy
youth
of
seventeen
year
,
be
follow
a
clearly
-
mark
trail
,
lead
through
the
western
part
of
Kentucky
toward
the
Mississippi
river
.
<EOS>
for
many
a
mile
he
follow
the
evenly
space
track
make
by
a
horse
on
a
walk
,
the
double
impression
be
a
trifle
more
than
three
foot
apart
.
<EOS>
“Helloa
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
,
Jack
,
when
he
look
at
the
earth
again
and
observe
that
the
track
have
take
a
new
form
,
with
nearly
eight
foot
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
Otto
have
force
the
colt
to
a
trot
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
in
a
hurry
,
or
he
think
I
be
fond
of
travel
.
<EOS>
”thu
<EOS>
far
the
lusty
young
Kentuckian
feel
no
misgiving
,
but
within
fifty
yard
the
trail
undergo
the
startling
change
—
the
footprint
be
separate
by
more
than
three
yard
now
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
gracious
<EOS>
,
"
mutter
the
boy
,
come
to
a
full
stop
,
"
something
be
wrong
:
Otto
would
not
have
put
the
horse
on
a
dead
run
if
he
have
not
be
scare
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
prove
his
training
by
the
keenness
and
quickness
with
which
he
survey
his
surrounding
.
<EOS>
the
wood
be
on
every
hand
,
but
they
be
open
and
free
from
undergrowth
,
so
that
he
gain
an
extensive
view
.
<EOS>
as
he
advance
with
vigorous
step
along
the
wind
path
,
his
eye
sometimes
rest
on
the
pendulous
branch
of
the
majestic
elm
,
a
small
purple
flower
here
and
there
still
cling
to
the
limb
and
resist
the
budding
leave
strive
to
force
it
aside
;
the
massive
oak
and
its
twisted
,
iron
limb
;
the
pinnate
leave
of
the
hickory
,
whose
solid
trunk
,
when
gash
by
the
axe
,
be
of
snowy
whiteness
;
the
pale
green
spike
and
tiny
flower
of
the
chestnut
;
the
sycamore
,
whose
spread
limb
find
themselves
crowd
even
in
the
most
open
space
,
with
an
occasional
wild
cherry
or
tulip
,
and
now
and
then
a
pine
,
whose
resinous
breath
brood
like
a
perennial
balm
over
the
vast
solitude
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
be
array
in
the
coarse
,
serviceable
garb
of
the
border
:
heavy
calf
-
skin
shoe
,
thick
trouser
,
legging
and
coat
,
the
latter
short
and
clasped
at
the
waist
by
a
girdle
,
also
of
woolen
and
similar
to
that
of
the
modern
ulster
.
<EOS>
the
cap
be
of
the
same
material
and
,
like
the
other
garment
,
have
be
fashion
and
put
together
by
the
deft
hand
of
the
mother
in
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
Powder
-
horn
and
bullet
-
pouch
be
suspend
by
string
pass
over
alternate
side
of
the
neck
and
a
fine
flint
-
lock
rifle
,
the
inseparable
companion
of
the
western
youth
,
rest
on
the
right
shoulder
,
the
hand
grasp
it
near
the
stock
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
hasty
survey
fail
to
reveal
any
cause
for
fear
,
and
he
resume
his
pursuit
,
as
it
may
be
term
.
<EOS>
the
quick
glance
he
cast
on
the
ground
in
front
show
,
in
every
instance
,
that
the
horse
he
be
follow
be
flee
at
the
same
headlong
pace
.
<EOS>
His
rider
have
spur
him
to
a
dead
run
,
at
which
gait
he
have
shoot
underneath
the
limb
of
the
tree
at
great
risk
to
himself
as
well
as
to
his
rider
.
<EOS>
the
trail
be
broad
,
for
loaded
horse
have
pass
in
both
direction
,
and
wild
animal
avail
themselves
of
it
more
than
once
in
make
their
pilgrimage
to
the
Mississippi
,
or
in
migrate
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
footprint
that
have
be
make
within
the
past
few
day
,
with
the
single
exception
note
—
that
of
the
horse
which
have
abruptly
break
into
a
full
run
.
<EOS>
the
balmy
afternoon
be
draw
to
a
close
,
and
Jack
begin
to
believe
the
chance
be
against
overtake
his
friend
and
companion
,
young
Otto
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
he
have
keep
this
up
very
long
,
he
must
be
far
beyond
my
reach
,
unless
he
have
turn
about
and
take
the
back
trail
.
<EOS>
”glance
<EOS>
at
the
sky
as
see
through
the
branch
overhead
,
the
youth
observe
that
it
be
clear
,
the
deep
blue
fleck
here
and
there
by
patch
of
snowy
cloud
,
rest
motionless
in
the
crystalline
air
.
<EOS>
comparatively
young
as
be
Jack
,
he
have
be
thoroughly
train
in
woodcraft
.
<EOS>
when
beyond
sight
of
the
cabin
of
the
straggle
settlement
,
where
he
make
his
home
,
he
be
as
watchful
and
alert
as
Daniel
Boone
or
Simon
Kenton
himself
.
<EOS>
His
penetrate
gray
eye
not
only
scan
the
sinuous
path
,
stretch
in
front
,
but
dart
from
side
to
side
,
and
be
frequently
turn
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
if
danger
threaten
it
be
as
likely
to
come
from
one
point
as
another
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
avoid
one
conclusion
:
the
peril
which
have
impel
the
young
German
's
horse
to
such
a
burst
of
speed
must
have
be
in
the
form
dread
above
all
other
—
that
of
the
wild
Indians
who
at
that
day
roam
through
the
vast
wilderness
of
the
West
and
hover
along
the
frontier
,
eager
to
use
the
torch
,
the
rifle
,
or
the
tomahawk
,
whenever
and
wherever
the
way
open
.
<EOS>
the
probability
that
such
be
the
cause
of
the
horseman
's
haste
throw
the
young
Kentuckian
at
once
on
his
mettle
.
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
he
be
put
forth
every
effort
to
rejoin
his
companion
,
there
be
good
reason
for
fear
a
collision
with
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
several
desperate
affray
with
them
,
and
,
like
a
sensible
person
,
he
spare
no
exertion
to
escape
all
such
encounter
.
<EOS>
“if
<EOS>
they
will
let
me
alone
<EOS>
I
will
not
disturb
them
,
"
be
the
principle
which
not
only
he
,
but
many
of
the
brave
frontiersman
follow
dare
the
eventful
early
day
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
the
youth
now
drop
into
the
lope
trot
of
the
American
Indian
—
a
gait
which
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
dusky
warrior
himself
,
he
be
able
to
maintain
hour
after
hour
,
without
fatigue
.
<EOS>
the
sharp
glance
throw
in
every
direction
be
not
long
in
make
a
discovery
,
though
not
of
the
nature
anticipate
.
<EOS>
a
short
distance
in
front
a
white
oak
,
whose
trunk
be
fully
two
foot
in
diameter
,
grow
beside
the
trail
which
he
be
follow
.
<EOS>
Its
shaggy
limb
twist
their
way
across
the
path
and
among
the
branch
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
the
exuberant
leave
offer
such
invite
concealment
to
man
and
animal
that
the
youth
subject
them
to
the
keen
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
His
trot
drop
to
a
slow
walk
,
and
he
instinctively
glance
at
the
lock
of
his
gun
to
make
sure
it
be
ready
for
any
emergency
.
<EOS>
something
be
move
among
the
branch
of
the
forest
monarch
,
but
Jack
know
it
be
not
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
no
warrior
would
climb
into
a
tree
to
wait
for
his
prey
,
when
,
he
could
secure
well
concealment
on
the
ground
,
where
he
would
not
be
compel
to
yield
the
use
of
his
leg
,
which
play
such
an
important
part
in
the
maneuvering
of
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
the
lad
catch
several
glimpse
of
the
strange
animal
,
and
,
when
within
a
few
rod
,
identify
it
.
<EOS>
“It
be
a
painter
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
resume
his
slow
advance
and
give
a
sigh
of
relief
;
"
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
worth
while
to
give
him
a
shot
or
not
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
name
"
painter
,
"
so
common
among
american
hunter
,
be
a
corruption
of
"
panther
,
"
which
be
itself
an
incorrect
application
,
the
genuine
panther
be
find
only
in
Africa
and
India
.
<EOS>
in
South
America
the
correspond
animal
be
the
jaguar
,
and
in
North
America
the
cougar
or
catamount
,
and
sometimes
the
american
lion
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carlton
do
not
hold
the
brute
in
special
fear
,
though
he
know
that
when
wound
or
impel
by
hunger
he
be
a
dangerous
foe
.
<EOS>
during
an
unusually
cold
day
,
only
a
few
month
before
,
one
of
them
have
make
an
open
attack
on
him
,
inflict
some
severe
scratch
and
tear
most
of
his
clothe
to
shred
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
one
of
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
for
the
young
Kentuckian
to
settle
the
whole
question
by
leave
the
trail
and
make
a
detour
that
would
take
him
safely
by
the
treacherous
beast
,
which
,
as
a
rule
,
be
afraid
to
assault
a
person
.
<EOS>
the
lad
be
certain
that
at
that
season
of
the
year
it
would
not
leave
the
tree
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
take
such
a
course
,
it
would
be
a
confession
of
timidity
on
his
part
against
which
,
his
nature
and
training
rebel
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
after
brief
hesitation
,
"
I
will
not
leave
the
path
for
all
the
painter
this
side
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
wise
for
me
to
fire
my
gun
just
now
<EOS>
and
I
will
not
do
it
,
if
he
behave
himself
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
put
up
with
any
nonsense
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
bring
his
weapon
in
front
,
raise
the
hammer
and
closely
watch
the
animal
above
,
while
the
quadrupe
be
equally
intent
in
observe
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
sight
—
the
two
scrutinize
each
other
with
such
defiant
distrust
.
<EOS>
the
cougar
be
crouch
on
a
broad
limb
,
just
far
enough
from
the
trunk
of
the
oak
to
be
directly
over
the
trail
.
<EOS>
He
be
extend
full
length
,
and
,
as
partly
see
through
the
leave
,
offer
the
good
target
possible
for
the
marksman
below
.
<EOS>
but
Jack
prefer
not
to
fire
his
gun
,
for
the
reason
that
the
report
be
likely
to
be
hear
by
more
dangerous
enemy
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
be
to
refrain
from
do
so
,
unless
force
to
shoot
in
self
defense
,
and
his
pride
would
not
permit
him
to
deviate
a
hair's
-
breadth
from
the
path
in
order
to
escape
the
necessity
of
shooting
.
<EOS>
He
walk
with
the
deliberate
,
noiseless
tread
of
an
Indian
,
look
steadily
upward
at
the
eye
which
assume
a
curious
,
phosphorescent
glare
,
that
scintillate
with
a
greenish
light
,
as
the
relative
position
of
the
enemy
change
.
<EOS>
the
lad
pass
under
the
limb
stare
unflinchingly
aloft
.
<EOS>
when
exactly
beneath
,
the
cougar
be
hide
for
an
instant
from
sight
,
but
,
recognize
the
change
condition
,
he
quickly
lift
his
head
to
the
right
,
and
the
lad
again
see
the
greenish
glare
,
the
white
tooth
,
and
blood
red
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
trace
the
outline
of
the
sinewy
body
close
along
the
limb
,
and
through
which
he
could
have
drive
a
bullet
with
fatal
certainty
.
<EOS>
the
"
painter
,
"
whose
scream
be
often
mistaken
for
the
cry
of
a
human
being
,
utter
an
occasional
snarl
growl
as
he
look
down
on
the
lad
.
<EOS>
His
attitude
and
manner
seem
to
say
:
"
I
have
get
my
eye
on
you
,
young
man
!
<EOS>
walk
very
straight
or
you
will
find
yourself
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
”the
probability
that
a
cougar
be
gather
his
muscle
on
a
limb
with
the
intention
of
bound
down
on
one
's
shoulder
,
be
enough
to
make
the
brave
man
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
do
feel
a
creep
chill
,
but
the
same
pride
which
prevent
him
deviate
a
hair's
-
breadth
from
the
trail
,
would
not
allow
him
to
increase
or
retard
his
gait
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
you
think
you
can
make
me
run
,
old
fellow
,
"
he
mutter
,
with
his
gaze
still
fix
on
the
beast
,
"
you
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
meet
wild
animal
in
Kentucky
that
be
able
to
drive
us
out
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
fancy
,
either
,
that
I
be
in
any
hurry
to
walk
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
,
to
show
the
contempt
in
which
he
hold
the
beast
,
the
youth
at
that
moment
come
to
a
full
stop
,
turn
about
and
face
him
.

CHAPTER
ii
.
<EOS>
what
a
RIFLE
-
SHOT
<EOS>
didthe
moment
the
young
Kentuckian
assume
this
attitude
,
he
become
aware
that
the
cougar
have
determine
upon
hostility
.
<EOS>
with
a
rasping
snarl
he
bury
his
claws
in
the
shaggy
bark
,
press
his
body
still
closer
to
the
limb
,
and
then
shoot
downward
straight
toward
Jack
,
who
be
too
vigilant
to
be
catch
unprepared
.
<EOS>
leap
backward
a
couple
of
step
,
he
bring
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
like
a
flash
,
and
fire
almost
at
the
moment
the
animal
leave
his
perch
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
miss
under
the
circumstance
,
and
the
"
painter
"
receive
his
death
wound
,
as
may
be
say
,
while
in
mid
-
air
.
<EOS>
He
strike
the
ground
with
a
heavy
thump
,
make
a
blind
leap
toward
the
youthful
hunter
,
who
recoil
several
step
more
,
and
then
,
after
a
brief
struggle
,
the
beast
lie
dead
.
<EOS>
during
these
moment
,
Jack
Carleton
,
follow
the
rule
he
be
teach
when
first
give
his
gun
,
occupy
himself
with
reload
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
a
charge
of
powder
be
pour
from
the
hollow
cow
's
horn
,
with
its
wooden
stopper
,
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
this
go
rattle
like
fine
sand
down
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
the
square
piece
of
muslin
be
hammer
on
top
until
the
ramrod
almost
bound
from
the
gun
;
then
the
bullet
which
the
youthful
hunter
have
mold
himself
,
be
shove
gently
but
firmly
downward
,
back
by
another
bit
of
muslin
.
<EOS>
the
ramrod
be
push
into
its
place
,
and
the
hammer
,
clasp
the
yellow
,
translucent
flint
,
be
draw
far
back
,
like
the
jaw
of
a
wild
cat
,
and
the
black
grain
sprinkle
into
the
pan
.
<EOS>
the
jaw
be
slowly
let
back
so
as
to
hold
the
prime
fast
,
and
the
old
fashioned
rifle
,
such
as
our
grandfather
be
accustomed
to
use
,
be
ready
for
duty
.
<EOS>
Jack
survey
the
motionless
figure
on
the
ground
and
said:“I
do
not
think
you
will
ever
amount
to
anything
again
as
a
painter
;
at
any
rate
,
you
be
not
likely
to
drop
on
to
a
fellow
's
head
when
he
be
walk
under
a
tree
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
,
without
give
him
any
further
notice
,
he
turn
about
and
resume
his
walk
toward
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
be
vain
,
however
,
for
him
to
seek
to
suppress
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
the
trail
of
the
flying
horse
still
indicate
that
he
be
go
on
a
dead
run
,
and
some
unusual
cause
must
have
impel
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Jack
could
not
doubt
that
his
friend
Otto
be
drive
to
such
severe
effort
by
the
appearance
of
Indians
,
but
it
would
seem
that
the
terrific
gait
of
the
Steed
ought
to
have
take
him
beyond
all
danger
very
speedily
,
whereas
,
for
more
than
a
mile
,
the
pace
show
not
the
slight
diminution
.
<EOS>
at
the
most
,
Otto
be
not
more
than
an
hour
in
advance
,
and
his
friend
,
therefore
,
have
good
reason
to
fear
he
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
dreaded
red
man
.
<EOS>
the
young
hunter
be
brave
,
but
he
be
not
reckless
.
<EOS>
He
have
refuse
to
turn
aside
to
avoid
a
collision
with
the
cougar
,
but
he
do
not
hesitate
to
leave
the
trail
,
in
the
hope
of
escape
the
savage
who
be
likely
to
be
attract
by
the
report
of
the
gun
.
<EOS>
from
the
beginning
the
lad
have
step
as
lightly
as
possible
,
bring
his
foot
softly
but
squarely
down
on
the
ground
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
American
Indian
,
when
thread
his
way
through
the
trackless
forest
.
<EOS>
He
now
use
the
utmost
care
in
leave
the
trail
,
for
none
know
better
than
he
the
amazing
keenness
of
the
dark
eye
that
be
liable
to
scan
the
ground
over
which
he
have
pass
.
<EOS>
not
until
he
be
several
rod
from
the
footprint
of
the
flying
horse
do
he
advance
with
anything
like
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
then
move
with
more
certainty
until
he
reach
a
chestnut
,
whose
trunk
be
broad
enough
to
afford
all
the
concealment
he
could
desire
.
<EOS>
step
behind
this
,
Jack
assume
a
position
which
give
him
a
view
of
the
trail
,
with
no
likelihood
of
be
see
,
unless
the
suspicion
of
the
Indians
should
be
direct
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
they
be
come
,
it
be
time
they
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
word
be
yet
in
the
mouth
of
the
youth
,
when
something
seem
to
twinkle
and
flicker
among
the
tree
,
in
advance
of
the
point
where
he
have
turn
aside
from
the
path
.
<EOS>
a
second
look
allow
that
two
indian
warrior
be
return
along
the
trail
.
<EOS>
He
recognize
them
as
Shawanoes
—
one
of
the
fierce
tribe
that
resist
the
march
of
civilization
a
century
ago
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
they
correspond
to
the
Apaches
of
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
the
couple
be
scrutinize
the
ground
,
as
they
advance
with
head
throw
forward
and
their
serpent
-
like
eye
flit
from
side
to
side
.
<EOS>
manifestly
they
be
expect
to
discover
certain
party
along
the
trail
itself
.
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
something
in
the
peculiar
sound
of
the
rifle
,
which
raise
their
suspicion
,
though
it
be
hard
to
understand
wherein
the
report
of
two
similarly
make
weapon
can
possess
any
perceptible
difference
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
that
which
Jack
Carleton
fear
have
take
place
—
the
shot
which
kill
the
cougar
bring
far
more
dangerous
enemy
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
the
lad
would
have
have
no
difficulty
in
pick
off
one
of
the
warrior
,
but
he
have
not
the
remote
intention
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
justification
for
such
a
wanton
act
,
and
the
consequence
could
not
fail
to
be
disastrous
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
better
prepared
to
support
the
creed
of
the
frontiersman
who
would
willingly
leave
the
red
man
unmoleste
if
they
in
turn
seek
to
do
them
no
harm
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoes
soon
pass
by
,
make
no
pause
until
they
reach
the
carcass
of
the
panther
.
<EOS>
They
quickly
see
the
bullet
-
wound
,
between
his
fore
leg
,
and
understand
that
his
heart
have
be
pierce
while
in
the
act
of
leaping
from
his
perch
upon
the
hunter
beneath
.
<EOS>
a
brief
scrutiny
of
the
ground
bring
to
light
the
impression
of
the
calf
-
skin
shoe
of
him
who
have
fire
the
fatal
shot
.
<EOS>
They
understand
at
once
that
the
party
be
a
white
person
,
and
,
judge
from
the
size
of
the
footprint
,
he
clearly
be
an
adult
-
one
who
,
it
be
safe
to
conclude
,
be
able
to
take
good
care
of
himself
;
but
it
must
have
be
a
relief
to
the
warrior
when
their
examination
of
the
earth
show
that
only
a
single
member
of
the
detest
race
have
be
concern
in
the
death
of
the
cougar
.
<EOS>
that
which
follow
be
precisely
what
the
watcher
expect
.
<EOS>
the
moment
the
red
man
be
certain
of
the
direction
take
by
the
hunter
they
start
along
the
same
line
.
<EOS>
the
foremost
look
down
for
an
instant
at
the
ground
,
and
then
seem
to
dart
a
glance
at
every
visible
point
around
him
.
<EOS>
the
other
warrior
do
not
once
look
down
,
but
guard
against
run
into
any
ambush
for
it
<EOS>
nee
not
be
say
that
the
task
on
which
they
be
engage
be
most
delicate
and
dangerous
.
<EOS>
the
American
Indian
can
not
excel
the
white
man
in
woodcraft
and
subtlety
,
and
no
Kentucky
pioneer
ever
stand
still
and
allow
a
dusky
foe
to
creep
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
concede
that
a
point
have
be
reach
where
Jack
Carleton
have
good
cause
for
alarm
.
<EOS>
those
Shawanoe
be
follow
his
trail
,
and
they
have
but
to
keep
it
up
for
a
short
distance
when
he
be
certain
to
be
"
uncover
.
<EOS>
”“I
wish
there
be
only
one
of
them
,
"
mutter
the
youth
,
stealthily
peer
from
behind
the
tree
;
"
it
will
be
hard
to
manage
two
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
coolness
of
Jack
be
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
though
he
feel
the
situation
be
critical
in
the
high
degree
,
yet
there
be
not
a
tremor
of
the
muscle
,
nor
blanching
of
the
countenance
,
as
it
would
seem
be
inevitable
when
such
a
desperate
encounter
impend
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
single
,
shadowy
hope
;
it
be
fast
grow
dark
in
the
wood
,
and
the
eye
of
the
Shawanoes
,
keen
as
they
be
,
must
soon
fail
them
.
<EOS>
the
sun
have
set
and
twilight
already
fill
the
forest
arch
with
gloom
.
<EOS>
peer
around
the
bark
,
Jack
see
the
lead
indian
bend
lower
,
leave
to
the
other
the
task
of
guard
against
mishap
.
<EOS>
He
walk
more
slowly
;
it
be
plain
his
task
be
not
only
difficult
,
but
be
become
more
so
every
moment
.
<EOS>
Jack
follow
the
movement
with
rapt
attention
.
<EOS>
know
the
precise
point
where
he
have
leave
the
path
,
his
heart
throb
faster
than
be
its
will
not
,
when
he
see
his
enemy
close
to
the
tingle
in
his
course
.
<EOS>
a
half
minute
later
they
be
beyond
—
they
have
overrun
his
trail
.
<EOS>
a
short
distance
only
be
pass
,
when
the
warrior
seem
to
suspect
the
truth
.
<EOS>
They
come
to
a
halt
,
and
the
trail
-
hunter
sink
upon
his
knee
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
so
close
to
the
ground
that
it
look
as
if
he
be
draw
line
and
figure
with
his
curve
nose
,
which
slowly
circle
around
and
back
and
forth
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
gently
move
over
the
leave
,
touch
them
as
lightly
as
the
fall
snowflake
,
and
with
as
wonderful
delicacy
as
that
of
the
blind
reader
,
when
his
finger
be
grope
over
the
raise
letter
of
the
Book
of
Life
.
<EOS>
the
young
Kentuckian
from
his
place
of
concealment
smile
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“There
be
some
thing
which
even
a
Shawanoe
,
can
not
do
,
and
that
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
”such
be
the
fact
;
for
,
with
that
care
which
the
train
pioneer
never
permit
himself
to
forget
or
disregard
,
the
lad
have
adopt
every
artifice
at
his
command
to
add
to
the
difficulty
of
identify
his
footstep
.
<EOS>
the
warrior
straighten
up
with
an
impatient
"
ugh
!
"
<EOS>
which
bring
another
smile
to
the
face
of
the
watcher
,
for
it
prove
beyond
question
the
failure
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
,
however
,
have
establish
one
fact
—
the
overrunning
of
the
trail
.
<EOS>
the
one
for
whom
they
be
search
have
leave
the
path
at
some
point
behind
them
.
<EOS>
scant
chance
be
there
of
learn
the
precise
spot
.
<EOS>
“follow
me
<EOS>
if
you
can
,
"
be
the
exultant
thought
of
Jack
,
who
carefully
lower
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
that
as
the
painter
be
determine
on
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
he
do
not
do
it
earlier
in
the
day
—
helloa!”while
speak
to
himself
,
he
become
aware
that
the
warrior
be
invisible
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
believe
they
be
act
as
oscillate
target
for
some
hide
enemy
,
who
be
likely
to
press
the
trigger
at
any
moment
;
and
,
unable
even
to
approximate
as
they
be
his
biding
-
place
,
they
withdraw
in
their
characteristic
fashion
.
<EOS>
Jack
thrust
his
head
still
further
from
behind
the
tree
,
and
finally
step
forth
that
he
may
obtain
the
good
view
he
could
.
<EOS>
but
the
red
man
have
vanish
like
the
shadow
of
swiftly
-
move
cloud
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
to
be
fear
from
that
source
.
<EOS>
but
with
the
lifting
of
the
peril
from
his
own
shoulder
,
there
return
his
distress
anxiety
for
his
absent
companion
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
could
exist
that
when
he
put
his
horse
to
his
hurried
flight
,
he
have
do
so
to
escape
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
whether
he
have
succeed
remain
to
be
learn
,
but
Jack
feel
that
every
probability
be
against
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
well
debate
as
to
his
own
duty
in
the
premise
.
<EOS>
His
one
desire
be
to
learn
what
have
become
of
Otto
,
the
german
lad
,
with
whom
he
leave
the
settlement
a
couple
of
day
before
.
<EOS>
neither
have
ever
visit
this
section
,
but
they
be
follow
the
instruction
of
those
who
have
,
and
the
young
Kentuckian
know
the
precise
point
in
their
journey
that
have
be
reach
.
<EOS>
stand
as
motionless
as
the
tree
beside
him
and
amid
the
darkening
shadow
,
Jack
Carleton
listen
with
the
intentness
of
an
indian
scout
steal
into
a
hostile
camp
.
<EOS>
the
soft
murmur
which
seem
to
reach
us
when
a
sea
-
shell
be
hold
to
the
ear
fill
the
air
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
voice
of
the
night
—
the
sighing
of
the
scarcely
move
wind
among
the
multitudinous
branch
,
the
restless
movement
of
myriad
of
tree
—
the
soft
embrace
of
million
of
leave
,
which
,
like
the
great
ocean
itself
,
even
when
the
air
be
pulseless
,
be
never
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
have
spend
too
many
day
and
night
in
the
wood
to
be
greatly
impressed
with
the
solemnity
and
grandeur
of
his
surrounding
.
<EOS>
that
which
would
have
awe
his
soul
,
if
note
for
the
first
time
,
have
lose
the
power
to
do
so
from
its
familiarity
;
but
while
in
the
attitude
of
listening
,
he
become
conscious
of
another
sound
which
do
not
belong
to
the
vast
forest
,
the
throbbing
air
,
nor
the
gathering
darkness
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
III
.
<EOS>
on
the
BANK
of
the
mississippithat
which
reach
the
ear
of
Jack
Carleton
,
while
he
stand
in
the
wood
,
silent
and
listening
,
be
a
peculiar
swashing
noise
,
which
continue
a
few
second
,
follow
by
the
same
space
of
silence
—
the
interval
be
as
regular
as
the
ticking
of
a
huge
pendulum
.
<EOS>
accompany
the
sound
be
another
,
a
soft
,
almost
inaudible
flow
,
such
as
one
hear
when
stand
on
the
bank
of
a
vast
stream
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
both
be
cause
by
the
sweep
of
the
mighty
Mississippi
which
be
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
the
reason
for
the
first
he
could
not
understand
,
but
that
of
the
latter
be
apparent
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
look
upon
the
Father
of
Waters
,
but
many
a
time
he
have
rest
along
the
Ohio
and
be
lull
to
sleep
by
its
musical
flow
,
even
while
the
camp
-
fire
of
the
hostile
red
man
twinkle
on
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
manifestly
nothing
could
be
do
by
remain
where
he
be
,
and
,
in
the
same
guard
manner
in
which
he
leave
the
trail
a
half
hour
before
,
he
begin
pick
his
way
back
.
<EOS>
probably
he
run
great
personal
risk
in
follow
the
beat
path
,
yet
he
be
control
by
a
true
hunter
's
instinct
in
every
movement
make
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
the
trail
,
he
observe
that
not
only
have
the
night
descend
,
but
the
full
moon
be
shine
from
an
almost
unclouded
sky
.
<EOS>
the
tree
,
crown
with
exuberant
vegetation
,
cast
deep
shadow
,
like
those
of
the
electric
light
,
and
only
here
<EOS>
and
there
do
the
arrowy
moonbeams
strike
the
ground
,
redolent
with
the
odor
of
fresh
earth
and
moldering
leave
.
<EOS>
“some
of
the
warrior
may
be
return
or
grope
along
the
trail
,
"
be
the
thought
of
the
youth
,
who
glide
silently
forward
,
his
sense
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
His
misgiving
,
however
,
be
much
less
than
when
watch
the
two
Shawanoes
,
for
with
the
dense
gloom
of
the
forest
inclose
him
on
every
hand
<EOS>
,
he
feel
that
the
shelter
be
not
only
secure
but
be
of
instant
avail
.
<EOS>
Less
than
a
furlong
be
pass
,
when
he
catch
the
shimmering
of
water
.
<EOS>
a
few
step
further
<EOS>
and
he
stand
for
the
first
time
on
the
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
the
youth
feel
those
emotion
which
must
come
to
every
one
when
he
emerge
from
a
vast
forest
at
night
and
pause
beside
one
of
the
grand
stream
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
at
that
day
its
real
source
be
unknown
,
but
Jack
,
who
be
unusually
well
inform
for
one
of
his
year
,
be
aware
that
it
rise
somewhere
among
the
snowy
mountain
and
unexplored
region
far
to
the
northward
,
and
that
,
after
its
winding
course
of
hundred
of
league
,
during
which
it
receive
the
volume
of
many
river
,
enormous
in
themselves
,
it
debouch
into
the
tropical
water
of
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.
<EOS>
the
reflection
of
the
turbid
current
show
that
it
be
flow
swiftly
.
<EOS>
the
dark
line
of
the
forest
on
the
other
shore
appear
like
a
solid
wall
of
blackness
,
while
to
the
north
and
south
the
view
end
in
the
same
impenetrable
gloom
.
<EOS>
impressed
and
awe
by
the
scene
,
the
lad
see
something
which
at
first
startle
him
by
its
resemblance
to
a
man
,
stand
in
the
river
,
with
his
foot
brace
against
the
bottom
and
his
head
and
shoulder
above
the
surface
.
<EOS>
the
current
seem
to
rush
against
his
bare
breast
,
from
which
it
be
cast
back
and
aside
,
as
though
fling
off
by
a
granite
rock
.
<EOS>
then
the
head
bow
forward
,
as
if
the
strong
man
seek
to
bathe
his
brain
in
the
cool
water
,
that
he
may
be
refresh
against
the
next
shock
.
<EOS>
a
minute
's
scrutiny
be
enough
to
show
Jack
that
the
object
be
a
tree
,
which
,
roll
into
the
river
at
some
point
,
perhaps
hundred
of
mile
above
,
have
grow
weary
of
its
journey
,
and
,
plunge
its
foot
into
the
muddy
bed
of
the
stream
,
have
,
refuse
to
go
further
.
<EOS>
the
fierce
current
would
lift
the
head
several
foot
with
a
splash
,
but
could
hold
it
thus
only
a
part
of
a
minute
,
when
it
would
dip
for
a
brief
while
,
to
rise
again
and
repeat
the
action
.
<EOS>
the
tree
be
what
be
know
to
-
day
on
the
Mississippi
as
a
"
sawyer
,
"
and
which
be
so
dread
by
the
steamer
and
other
craft
navigate
the
river
.
<EOS>
many
a
boat
strike
at
full
speed
against
them
,
have
have
their
hull
pierce
as
if
by
a
hundred
-
pound
shell
,
and
have
go
to
the
bottom
like
stone
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
sound
make
by
the
"
sawyer
"
which
have
puzzle
Jack
Carleton
before
he
catch
sight
of
the
great
river
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
wonder
that
he
have
fail
to
guess
the
cause
of
the
intermittent
swash
which
reach
him
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
“And
we
must
cross
that
stream
,
"
murmur
Jack
,
with
half
a
shudder
,
as
he
look
out
upon
the
prodigious
volume
rush
southward
like
myriad
of
wild
horse

it

to
me

<EOS>
Otto

as
he
have
agree
to
do

be
ride
at

leisurely
pace

when
,
without
the

warning

the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
break
the
stillness
of
,
the
wood
on

right
,
and
the
bullet
zip
so
close
to
his

graze

leave
a

mark

<EOS>
He
put
the
horse
to
a
dead
run
,
first
throw
himself
forward
on
his
neck
so
as
to
offer
the
least
possible
target
to
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
only
the
single
shot
be
fire
,
and
Jack
count
it
strange
that
the
report
fail

reach
his

<EOS>
when
the
fugitive
have
go
a
considerable

he
venture

He
think
he
see
several

fancy

for
have
they
observe
he

leave
them
behind

(
as
would

<EOS>
Otto

in

danger
from

overhang
limb

be

fearful

Indians

that
he
keep
his

close

the
mane
of
his

the
awakening

the

notice
Otto
receive

the
chilling
embrace

”“Who

"
<EOS>
ask
the
astonished
Jack

<EOS>
“Deerfoot
,
the
Shawanoe
,
"
be
the
reply
of
Otto
,
who
,
with
a
light
heart
,
step
closer
to
the
edge
of
the
swiftly
flow
river
and
call
out:“Holloa
,
Deerfoot
!
<EOS>
how
you
vos?”The
mention
of
the
name
call
up
strange
emotion
in
the
breast
of
Jack
Carleton
.
<EOS>
for
a
year
previous
,
story
have
reach
the
settlement
where
he
have
make
his
home
,
of
the
wonderful
Shawanoe
youth
,
who
be
capture
when
a
child
,
and
while
he
be
as
untameable
in
his
hatred
of
the
white
as
a
spitting
wildcat
,
but
who
be
transform
by
kindness
into
the
most
devoted
friend
of
the
pioneer
.
<EOS>
Ned
Preston
,
who
live
at
Wild
Oaks
,
nearly
a
hundred
mile
distant
from
Jack
's
home
,
visit
the
latter
a
few
month
before
,
while
on
a
hunting
excursion
,
with
his
colored
friend
Wild
-
blossom
Brown
,
and
it
be
from
him
that
Jack
have
gain
many
particular
of
the
remarkable
history
of
the
young
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
Jack
credit
the
statement
of
Deerfoot
's
amazing
skill
in
the
use
of
his
bow
and
arrow
,
his
wonderful
fleetness
of
foot
,
and
his
chivalrous
devotion
to
his
friend
;
but
when
tell
that
the
youth
could
not
only
read
,
but
could
write
an
excellent
hand
,
and
that
he
be
a
true
Christian
,
Jack
feel
many
misgiving
of
the
truth
of
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
Jack
recall
further
the
statement
that
Deerfoot
be
hold
in
such
detestation
by
his
own
race
that
he
become
convince
his
presence
be
an
element
of
weakness
rather
than
strength
to
his
friend
,
and
it
be
for
that
reason
he
have
migrate
west
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
the
youthful
warrior
,
seat
in
the
stem
of
the
canoe
,
give
no
evidence
that
he
see
the
stubby
figure
of
the
german
lad
who
step
close
to
the
water
and
hail
him
by
name
.
<EOS>
one
powerful
impulse
of
the
paddle
send
the
bark
structure
far
up
the
bank
,
like
the
snout
of
some
aquatic
monster
plunge
after
the
lad
await
it
.
<EOS>
before
it
come
to
rest
,
Deerfoot
spring
lightly
ashore
,
and
,
grasp
the
front
of
the
boat
,
draw
it
still
further
from
the
river
,
where
it
be
not
only
safe
against
be
sweep
away
,
but
could
not
be
see
by
any
one
passing
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
His
next
proceeding
be
to
pick
up
his
bow
from
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
,
after
which
he
be
prepared
to
see
that
other
be
near
him
.
<EOS>
turn
about
,
he
extend
his
hand
to
Otto
with
the
smile
greeting
:
"
how
do
you
do
,
my
brother?”the
word
be
speak
with
as
perfect
accentuation
as
Jack
Carleton
could
have
use
.
<EOS>
have
the
speaker
be
invisible
,
no
one
would
have
believe
him
to
be
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
“I
do
vell
,
"
reply
Otto
,
shake
his
hand
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
Dis
ish
my
friend
,
Jack
Carleton
,
dot
I
dink
a
good
deal
of

<EOS>
”Dropping
<EOS>
the
hand
of
the
german
,
Deerfoot
take
one
step
forward
and
salute
the
young
Kentuckian
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
He
press
his
hand
warmly
,
and
,
with
the
same
smile
as
before
,
said:“deerfoot
be
glad
to
meet
his
brother
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
utter
these
word
the
moonlight
fall
on
his
face
and
the
front
part
of
his
body
,
so
that
a
well
view
of
countenance
and
feature
could
not
have
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
nearly
a
year
have
pass
since
we
last
see
Deerfoot
(
see
"
Ned
on
the
River
"
)
.
<EOS>
during
that
period
,
he
have
almost
attain
the
full
stature
of
a
warrior
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
there
be
no
single
person
,
whether
of
his
own
or
the
caucasian
race
,
whom
Deerfoot
hold
in
personal
fear
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
do
me
the
honor
of
read
the
"
Young
Pioneer
Series
,
"
will
recall
the
marked
attractiveness
of
Deerfoot
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
classical
regularity
of
his
feature
be
relieve
from
effeminacy
by
the
slightly
roman
nose
,
which
,
with
the
thin
lip
,
give
him
an
expression
of
firmness
and
nerve
that
be
true
to
his
character
.
<EOS>
when
he
step
in
front
of
the
great
Tecumseh
,
with
his
knife
clench
in
his
band
,
and
dare
the
chieftain
to
mortal
combat
,
the
luminous
black
eye
flash
lightning
,
and
the
muscle
on
the
graceful
limb
be
knot
like
iron
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
in
repose
and
the
eye
be
as
soft
as
those
of
a
maiden
.
<EOS>
when
Deerfoot
smile
it
be
rarely
more
than
it
faint
,
shadowy
expression
,
just
sufficient
to
reveal
the
small
,
even
,
white
tooth
and
to
add
to
the
winsomeness
of
his
expression
.
<EOS>
the
love
of
finery
and
display
seem
natural
to
every
human
being
,
and
it
manifest
itself
in
the
dress
of
the
young
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
the
long
black
hair
,
which
stream
down
his
shoulder
,
be
ornament
at
the
crown
by
several
eagle
feather
,
brilliantly
stain
and
thrust
in

<EOS>
the
fringe
of
the
neatly
fitting
legging

and
the
moccasin
which
incase
the
small
shapely
foot

with

<EOS>
the
body
of
the
hunting
shirt
as
well
as
the
skirt
,
which
descend
almost
to
his
knee
,
show
what
may
be
call
a
certain
subdue
gaudiness
which
be
not
without
its
attractiveness
.
<EOS>
the
waist
of
the
Shawanoe
be
clasp
by
a
girdle
into
which
be
thrust
a
knife
and
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
rely
upon
the
bow
,
instead
of
the
rifle

he
carry
a
quiver
full
of
arrow
,
just
show
over
the
right
shoulder
,
where
they
could
be
readily
pluck
with
his
deft
left
hand
,
whenever
require

<EOS>
Deerfoot
have
test
both
the
rifle
and
the
bowl
and
as
have
be

give
his
adherence
to
the
latter

Jack

these
characteristic
of

Jack

press
the

he

,
recall
the
amazing
story
tell
of
Deerfoot
by
Ned

begin
to
think
that

after
all

they

before
Jack
could

anything
more

“What

“I

around

FIREOn
a
tempestuous
night
in
midwinter
the
little
settlement
of
Coatesville

in
Kentucky

be
assail
by
a
fierce
band
of
Shawanoes
and
Hurons
.
<EOS>
the
pioneer
be
surprise
,
for
the
hour
be
near
daybreak
,
and
,
accustomed
as
they
be
to
the
foray
of
the
border
,
they
be
without
the
slight
warning
of
the
danger
which
burst
upon
them
.
<EOS>
They
rally
,
however
,
and
make
an
heroic
defense
,
but
when
with
the
dawning
of
day
the
warrior
withdraw
,
they
leave
more
than
half
the
hearthstone
darken
with
sorrow
and
woe
,
because
of
one
or
more
of
its
defender
who
have
fall
in
the
strife

<EOS>
among
those
that
have
perish

Abram

shoot
down
on
his

threshold
while
fight
for
his
wife
and
his
boy
Jack
,
who
themselves
be
do
their
utmost
to
beat
back
their
merciless
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
youth
,
as
he
grow
old
,
gradually
recover
from
his
grief
,
but
the
blow
be
so
terrible
to
the
stricken
widow
that
its
effect
remain
with
her
through
all
the
year
that
follow
.
<EOS>
the
vivacious
,
bright
-
hearted
wife
become
the
sad
,
thoughtful
woman
,
who
rarely
smile
,
and
who
walk
forever
in
the
shadow
of
her
desolation
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
her
boy
Jack
,
and
to
him
she
give
the
whole
wealth
of
her
attention
;
but
she
could
never
forget
the
brave
one
that
have
yield
his
life
for
her
and
her
child

<EOS>
some
year
later
a
portion
of
the
settler
become
dissatisfied
with
their
home
,
peculiarly
expose
as
it
be
to

and
determine
to
cross
the
Mississippi
into
that
portion
of
Louisiana
which
to

day
form
the
great
State
of
Missouri
.
<EOS>
to
many
it
seem
a
strange
refuge
,
for
the
change
,
it
may
be
say
,
take
them
still
further
from
civilization
;
but
the
reader
well
know
that
the
settlement
of
no
portion
of
the
Union
be
mark
by
such
deed
of
ferocity
as
that
of
the
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
,
and
the
pioneer
have
good
ground
to
hope
for
well
thing
in
the
strange
land
toward
which
they
turn
their
footstep
.
<EOS>
the

as

Saint

at
that
time

and
a
considerable
fur
trade
be

on
with
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
among
those
who
cross
the
Mississippi
be
the
widow
Carleton
.
<EOS>
Her
friend
believe
that
if
she
remove
forever
from
the
scene
of
her
great
affliction
she
may
recover
;
but
if
she
remain
she
must
soon
succumb
.
<EOS>
She
suffer
herself
to
be
persuade
,
and
go
in
the
company
of
those
who
promise
to
give
her
the
tender
attention
and
care
.
<EOS>
Her
decision
be
not
make
until
the
little
company
,
that
have
spend
week
in
preparation
,
be
on
the
eve
of
starting
.
<EOS>
It
thus
become
necessary
for
Jack
to
stay
behind
to
look
after
certain
interest
of
both
,
his
purpose
be
to
follow
in
the
course
of
a
few
week
.
<EOS>
the
long
journey
westward
be
make
in
safety
,
a
thriving
settlement
begin
,
and
young
Otto
Relstaub
,
the
son
of
a
hard
-
hearted
,
penurious
German
,
be
send
back
over
the
trail
,
accord
to
promise
,
to
guide
Jack
Carleton
,
who
be
impatiently
await
him
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
after
his
arrival
the
two
start
westward
,
all
their
earthly
effect
pack
upon
the
single
horse
.
<EOS>
They
take
turn
in
ride
the
animal
.
<EOS>
accustomed
as
they
be
to
constant
activity
,
they
would
have
enjoy
the
journey
on
foot
much
more
than
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
at
first
both
walk
,
but
,
after
their
animal
have
run
away
several
time
,
his
capture
cause
much
delay
,
trouble
,
and
roiling
of
temper
,
they
conclude
that
a
change
would
have
to
be
make
if
they
expect
ever
to
reach
their
destination
.
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
when
Otto
be
ride
considerably
in
advance
of
his
friend
,
he
be
fire
upon
by
Indians
,
narrowly
escape
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
incident
immediately
follow
have
already
be
tell
the
reader
.
<EOS>
It
be
yet
early
in
the
evening
when
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
act
upon
the
request
of
Otto
,
that
some
more
convenient
spot
should
be
select
in
which
to
continue
their
talk
.
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the
destination
of
the
boy
lie
to
the
westward
,
it
seem
to
Jack
Carleton
that
,
the
wise
thing
to
do
be
to
enter
the
canoe
,
and
allow
the
young
Shawanoe
to
paddle
them
across
;
but
he
hold
the
gift
and
skill
of
the
wonderful
warrior
in
such
high
estimation
that
he
fear
a
hint
of
the
kind
may
not
be
receive
with
favor
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
lead
the
way
through
the
wood
until
a
depression
be
reach
,
where
considerable
undergrowth
grow
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
a
stop
and
seem
to
be
look
around
in
the
darkness
,
which
to
the
other
be
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
“let
a
fire
be
kindle
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
only
a
few
minute
be
need
to
gather
all
the
fuel
require
.
<EOS>
It
be
heap
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
and
as
each
carry
a
flint
and
steel
,
a
bright
roaring
blaze
be
soon
under
way
.
<EOS>
have
Jack
and
Otto
be
alone
,
they
would
have
be
trouble
by
the
fear
that
their
campfire
would
be
see
by
prowl
enemy
but
the
air
of
unconcern
on
the
part
of
the
Shawanoe
infuse
into
them
a
feeling
of
confidence
which
drive
away
all
fear
.
<EOS>
enough
branch
and
leave
be
pile
together
to
afford
them
the
good
sort
of
couch
.
<EOS>
not
one
have
it
blanket
with
him
,
and
have
the
weather
be
cold
,
they
must
have
suffer
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
the
boy
have
lose
theirs
when
their
horse
run
away
the
last
time
,
and
Deerfoot
have
not
bring
any
with
him
,
though
one
remain
in
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
fortunately
the
night
be
not
only
mild
,
but
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
be
stirring
.
<EOS>
the
fire
radiate
all
the
heat
need
to
make
each
comfortable
.
<EOS>
They
assume
easy
posture
on
the
ground
,
and
,
as
the
reflection
light
up
each
countenance
,
they
look
curiously
at
one
another
,
as
if
seek
more
intimate
knowledge
of
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
and
Jack
have
already
be
sufficiently
refer
to
,
and
a
little
attention
be
due
to
the
honest
german
youth
,
who
have
his
part
to
play
in
the
follow
page
.
<EOS>
Otto
be
about
a
year
young
than
his
friend
,
and
bear
very
little
resemblance
to
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
possess
a
certain
rugged
grace
,
and
,
while
he
be
not
handsome
,
his
face
show
intelligence
with
mental
strength
,
sustain
by
bound
youth

and
a
physical
vigor
which
be
perfect

<EOS>
Otto
be
a
head
short
than
Jack
,
and
his
growth
seem
to
run
mostly
to
breadth
.
<EOS>
His
short
leg
bow
outward
at
the
knee
,
and
a
curve
seem
necessary

the
small
twinkle

direction

<EOS>
His
neck
be
short
,
and
hair
long
and
thick

<EOS>
His
dress
be
similar
to
that
wear

Jack

that
everything

be
of
the
coarse

<EOS>
Jacob
Relstaub
,
the
father
of
Otto
,
be
not
merely
penurious
,
but
he
be
miserly
and
mean
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
know
him
so
well
that
he
be
certain
<EOS>
there
would
be
serious
trouble
with
the

if
he
show
himself
in
the
little
frontier
town
without
the
valuable
horse
which
have
run
away
and
swam
the
river

<EOS>
there
be
one
respect
in
which
the
dress
of
the
german
differ
from
that
of
the
American

portion

of
impart
a
stiffness
to
the
head
gear
which
cause
it
to
keep
its

except
when
limp
from
moisture

<EOS>
such
youth
as
Otto
and
Jack
be
always
bless
with
the
most
vigorous
appetite
,
but
they
have
eat
during
the
afternoon
and
be
well
content
to
wait
until
the
morrow

<EOS>
as
for
Deerfoot
,
it
make
little
difference
to
him
whether
he
have
partake
since
the
rise
of
the
sun

for
he
have
be
teach
from
his
infancy
to
hold
every
propensity

stern
check

Oft

times

“How

He
look

a
moment
before

“Two

he

It

while

<EOS>
He
ask
him
to
enter
the
window
where
the
father
could
not

and
he
tell
Deerfoot
he
would
place
him
in

and
he
should
have

<EOS>
”the
<EOS>

pause
in

<EOS>
Jack

with

so
that

<EOS>
“Deerfoot
be

”“and

”“How

”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
throw
back
his
bead
and
laugh
,
though
he
take
care
that
he
make
little
noise
in
do
so
;
but
the
face
of
the
Shawanoe
be
grave
.
<EOS>
His
refined
nature
could
see
nothing
mirthful
in
the
cruel
punishment
inflict
upon
the
boy
because
he
do
a
kindness
to
a
stranger
of
another
race
.
<EOS>
the
brutal
father
have
only
to
thank
the
christian
restraint
of
Deerfoot
that
he
be
not
pierce
by
an
arrow
from
his
bow
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
do
not
need
explain
that
the
little
act
of
Otto
have
secure
his
last
gratitude
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
not
one
to
seek
his
company
or
intrude
himself
upon
him
;
but
he
be
ready
to
do
the
young
german
any
service
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
before
,
when
Deerfoot
be
return
from
the
direction
of
the
Mississippi
,
he
meet
Otto
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
the
latter
tell
him
he
be
go
to
Coatesville
to
bring
back
a
young
friend
,
whose
mother
be
in
the
new
settlement
.
<EOS>
for
some
reason
,
which
the
Shawanoe
do
not
make
known
,
he
could
not
accompany
Otto
,
or
he
would
have
do
so
;
but
he
give
him
full
direction
and
numerous
suggestion
,
every
one
of
which
Otto
forget
within
the
follow
fifteen
minute
.
<EOS>
deerfoot
,
however
,
after
make
some
calculation
as
to
the
time
the
boy
would
reach
the
Mississippi
on
their
return
,
promise
to
meet
them
there
and
to
take
them
across
in
his
canoe
,
which
be
hide
not
far
away
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
particularly
instruct
Otto
that
,
if
the
meeting
should
take
place
at
night
,
he
would
make
known
his
departure
from
the
Louisiana
side
by
swinge
a
torch
in
a
circular
manner
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
signal
which
recall
the
agreement
to
the
mind
of
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
remember
much
more
than
he
would
have
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
believe
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
<EOS>
NIGHT
and
morningdeerfoot
make
know
his
purpose
to
take
his
friend
across
the
Mississippi
on
the
morrow
in
his
canoe
,
after
which
he
would
keep
them
company
for
some
distance
along
the
trail
,
though
he
would
be
force
to
leave
them
long
before
reach
their
destination
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
naturally
feel
a
deep
interest
in
the
youthful
warrior
,
and
expect
him
to
give
some
fact
in
his
wonderful
history
,
as
well
as
an
intimation
of
what
his
life
be
likely
to
be
in
the
new
country
to
which
he
have
remove
,
but
much
to
the
young
Kentuckian
's
disappointment
,
he
carefully
avoid
all
reference
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
conversation
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
be
hardly
worth
recording
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
when
the
evening
be
well
along
,
Otto
throw
more
wood
on
the
flame
which
crackle
and
give
out
a
cheerful
glow
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
rise
to
his
foot
,
and
without
a
word
pass
out
into
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
the
hour
for
retiring
be
close
at
hand
,
and
he
prefer
to
make
a
reconnaissance
before
trust
themselves
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
He
return
as
noiselessly
as
he
go
,
remark
as
he
resume
his
seat
that
no
danger
whatever
threaten
them
,
and
they
could
slumber
in
peace
.
<EOS>
while
speak
,
he
draw
from
a
pocket
within
the
skirt
of
his
bunting
-
shirt
,
the
little
Bible
which
have
be
present
to
him
month
before
by
Mrs.
Preston
of
Wild
Oaks
,
after
the
other
volume
be
destroy
by
the
bullet
that
be
aim
at
the
heart
of
the
youth
,
by
the
hostile
chieftain
.
<EOS>
adjust
himself
in
an
easy
posture
on
the
ground
,
so
that
the
ruddy
fire
-
light
come
over
his
shoulder
and
fall
upon
the
page
with
its
minute
letter
,
the
young
Shawanoe
read
for
several
minute
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
other
hold
their
peace
,
impress
with
the
singular
sight
.
<EOS>
neither
could
doubt
that
he
clearly
comprehend
every
word
of
the
sublime
volume
,
and
they
feel
that
it
be
wrong
to
break
in
upon
his
meditation
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
he
raise
his
head
and
ask
,
"
Would
my
brother
wish
to
hear
Deerfoot
read?”“We
would
,
indeed
,
"
be
the
reply
of
Jack
Carleton
;
"
I
never
see
an
Indian
who
could
read
from
a
,
print
book
,
but
I
have
be
tell
that
you
can
write
an
excellent
hand
.
<EOS>
”Deerfoot
shake
his
head
disparagingly
.
<EOS>
“my
brother
mistake
,
but
Deerfoot
will
try
and
read
the
word
which
the
Great
Spirit
speak
to
all
his
people
,
whether
they
be
pale
face
or
red
man
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
then
,
in
a
low
musical
voice
,
tremulous
with
emotion
and
impressive
beyond
description
,
the
Shawanoe
read
an
entire
chapter
from
the
book
of
Revelations
,
his
favorite
portion
of
the
blessed
Book
,
the
other
listen
spellbound
.
<EOS>
even
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
see
and
hear
little
of
genuine
christian
teaching
in
his
cheerless
home
,
be
touch
as
never
before
by
the
indescribably
solemn
story
of
the
apocalyptic
vision
.
<EOS>
the
silence
which
succeed
last
several
minute
,
when
Jack
say
in
a
low
voice:“deerfoot
,
I
wish
you
would
speak
some
sentence
from
the
Bible
in
your
own
tongue
.
<EOS>
”“Does
<EOS>
my
brother
wish
to
learn
the
Shawanoe
language?”“I
have
hear
Shawanoes
,
Hurons
and
Miamis
talk
,
but
I
can
not
understand
a
word
;
I
have
a
curiosity
to
know
how
it
will
sound
to
hear
some
part
of
the
Bible
with
which
I
be
familiar
titter
in
an
unknown
tongue
.
<EOS>
”“what
<EOS>
part
of
the
book
<EOS>
can
my
brother
repeat
without
read
the
words?”“well
—
that
be
—
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Jack
,
confuse
by
the
question
of
Deerfoot
,
who
fix
his
eye
inquiringly
upon
him
;
"
I
mean
any
sentence
.
<EOS>
”“Does
<EOS>
my
brother
not
read
the
Bible
every
day
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
Indian
,
in
a
grieved
rather
than
a
reproving
voice
;
"
he
must
know
the
Lord
's
Prayer—”“O
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
"
reply
Jack
,
desperately
clutch
at
the
single
straw
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
ask
you
to
repeat
that
.
”In
<EOS>
the
same
low
,
reverent
voice
he
have
use
while
read
,
the
warrior
utter
the
inspire
petition
,
which
shall
last
through
all
time
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
he
said:“my
brother
would
like
to
remember
the
word
as
Deerfoot
have
speak
them
;
Deerfoot
will
print
them
for
him
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
draw
a
species
of
red
chalk
from
the
same
pocket
which
hold
the
Bible
,
he
write
for
several
minute
on
one
of
the
fly

leave
of
the
bock
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
he
glance
over
the
word
,
carefully
tear
out
the
leaf
and
hand
it
across
to
Jack

a
blush
to
the
face
of
the
sturdy
youth
that
have
listen
to
the

appeal
more
than
once
from
the
lip
of
his
mother

<EOS>
under
the
assurance
of
Deerfoot
,
the
boy
stretch
themselves
on
the
leave
and
branch
and
soon
sink
into
a
refreshing
slumber

<EOS>
Jack
recall
that
his
last
remembrance
be
of
Deerfoot
rest
his
head
on
his
elbow
,
while
he
seem
absorb
in
his
book
.
<EOS>
He
lie
as
motionless
as
a
figure
in
bronze
,
but
no
matter
how
much
he
may
be
enchain
by
the
word
,
he
could
not
be
insensible
of
what
be
go
on
around
him
.
<EOS>
both
Jack
and
Otto
sleep
until
the
light
of
morning
be
steal
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
they
arise
to
their
foot
,
they
see
the
Shawanoe
broil
a
couple
of
whitefish
which
he
have
manage
to
coax
from
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
He
have
almost
finish
before
his
friend
suspect
what
be
do
.
<EOS>
after
greet
the
warrior
,
the
other
pass
through
the
wood
to
the
margin
of
the
mighty
river
,
where
they
bathe
their
face
and
hand
,
take
a
slight
swallow
of
the
somewhat
muddy
water
and
then
rejoin
Deerfoot
,
who
have
their
breakfast
ready
.
<EOS>
“Did
<EOS>
my
brother
see
any
sign
that
frighten
them
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Deerfoot
,
when
the
three
have
seat
themselves
on
the
ground
and
be
partake
of
their
meal
.
<EOS>
“I
take
the
good
survey
I
could
of
the
river
,
"
reply
Jack
,
"
but
see
nothing
of
friend
or
foe
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
,
as
a
rule
,
there
be
many
Indians
in
this
section
.
<EOS>
”“The
shawanoe
often
hunt
to
the
river
,
but
do
not
cross
;
the
Miamis
come
down
from
the
north
,
and
Deerfoot
see
their
footprint
in
the
Woods
.
<EOS>
”“what
<EOS>
tribe
be
we
likely
to
meet
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
young
Kentuckian
,
who
naturally
feel
much
interest
in
the
land
wherein
he
expect
to
make
his
home
.
<EOS>
“There
be
many
red

,
even
to
the

stretch
far
beyond

”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
be
surprise
at
this

he
believe
,
be
to
the
Rocky
Mountains

of
which
little
more
than
their
simple
existence
be
know
to
the
rest
of
the
Union
at
that
day

<EOS>
but
the
word
which
follow
astonish
him
still
more:“beyond
<EOS>
the
mountain
open
the
great
sea
,
wide
than
that
which
the
pale

all
the

you
will
find
the
red
man

they
be
like
the
leave
in

Deerfoot
and
his

will
die
without
ever
hear
their

”“But
<EOS>
you
have

something
of

there

”“deerfoot

Jack

when

<EOS>
both
the

could
swim
the

though
,
with
their
rifle

to
take
care

it
be
anything

a
light
task

<EOS>
have
they

they

them

on

small
float

forward

<EOS>
when
the
emigrant
move
westward
they
halt
long
enough
on

to
construct
a

sufficient
to
carry
everything

make

<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII
.
<EOS>
a
SURPRISED
FISHERMANIt
may
be
say
that
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
never
lose
his
sense
except
when
slumber
steal
them
away
.
<EOS>
young
as
he
be
,
he
have
be
through
some
of
the
most
terrific
encounter
the
mind
can
conceive
,
and
yet
,
when
he
stand
erect
in
the
full
glare
of
the
noonday
sun
,
not
a
scratch
or
scar
speak
of
those
fearful
affray
in
the
depth
of
the
forest
,
among
the
hill
and
mountain
and
along
the
shore
of
the
river
of
Kentucky
and
Ohio
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
he
be
so
hate
by
his
own
people
that
he
feel
his
presence
near
the
settlement
to
the
eastward
be
more
to
the
disadvantage
than
the
help
of
his
friend
,
and
that
be
one
of
the
cause
which
lead
him
to
bid
adieu
forever
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
intimate
also
that
still
another
reason
actuate
him
,
and
that
reason
shall
appear
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
when
Deerfoot
assure
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
that
they
may
slumber
in
peace
,
he
speak
the
truth
;
it
have
be
show
that
not
the
first
breath
of
danger
touch
them
during
the
darkness
,
and
the
morning
meal
be
partake
in
the
same
enjoyable
fashion
.
<EOS>
but
before
the
subtle
young
Shawanoe
reach
the
spot
where
he
leave
his
canoe
,
he
be
disturb
by
discover
the
imprint
of
moccasin
along
shore
.
<EOS>
They
lead
away
from
his
friend
and
toward
the
canoe
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
show
the
latter
have
"
receive
"
some
visitor
since
its
owner
leave
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
utterly
destroy
.
<EOS>
the
knife
and
tomahawk
of
several
,
warrior
have
hack
be
bark
structure
to
piece
.
<EOS>
even
the
paddle
have
be
break
into
a
half
dozen
part
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
leave
of
which
use
could
be
make
,
the
blanket
of
the
owner
of
course
be
absent
.
<EOS>
deerfoot
look
on
the
wreck
with
something
like
dismay
,
which
speedily
turn
to
anger
.
<EOS>
the
wantonness
of
the
act
roil
his
feeling
and
stir
up
the
"
old
Indian
"
in
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
survey
the
destruction
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
sign
the
perpetrator
could
not
avoid
leave
behind
them
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
three
Indiana
engage
in
the
mischief
,
and
<EOS>
the
first
supposition
of
Deerfoot
be
that
they
be
the
Shawanoes
whom
Jack
Carleton
see
the
day
previous
;
but
a
few
minute
'
study
of
the
footprint
betray
a
certain
peculiarity
(
a
slight
turning
outward
of
the
left
foot
<EOS>
so
slight
,
indeed
,
as
almost
to
be
imperceptible
)
,
which
identify
them
as
Miamis
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
have
notice
the
"
sign
manual
"
year
before
,
so
there
be
no
room
for
mistake
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
the
party
have
come
down
from
the
northward
,
most
likely
with
other
warrior
,
and
have
stumble
by
mere
chance
upon
the
partially
hide
canoe
.
<EOS>
They
probably
investigate
matter
enough
to
learn
that
it
be
in
charge
of
two
white
person
and
one
red
one
—
enough
to
satisfy
them
that
the
single
Indian
be
friendly
to
the
settler
,
and
therefore
one
to
be
despise
and
harry
in
every
way
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
discovery
which
undoubtedly
cause
them
to
destroy
the
property
and
steal
the
blanket
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
enough
interested
to
seek
the
life
of
the
other
,
though
it
may
be
they
be
restrain
by
fear
from
do
so
.
<EOS>
when
Deerfoot
come
back
to
the
boy
,
he
purposely
display
some
excitement
in
order
to
amuse
them
.
<EOS>
He
quickly
explain
what
he
have
learn
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
indifferent
voice
and
manner
,
say
"
the
Miamis
shall
pay
Deerfoot
for
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
will
you
make
them
do
that
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Jack
,
who
notice
the
peculiar
sparkle
which
the
friend
of
the
warrior
always
observe
when
his
feeling
be
stir
.
<EOS>
“I
do
not
not
believe
dot
you
and
dem
can
not
agree
mit

"
say
Otto
;
"
derefore
you

for
me

and
I
tell
you
what

<EOS>
don't
it?”“deerfoot
will
not
need

"
say
the
Indian
,
gravely
;
"
but
he
ask
his
brother
to
wait
till
he
come
back”“We'll
do
that
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
that
is
,
as
long
as
there
be
a
prospect
of
your
return
.
<EOS>
when
shall
we
expect
you?”“Deerfoot
will
be
with
his
brother
before
the
sun
reach
yonder
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
point
to
the
place
in
the
sky
which
the
orb
would
touch
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
then
,
warn
the
two
to
be
very
careful
,
and
to
keep
continual
watch
against
detection
,
he
move
away
,
vanish
from
sight
in
the
wood
behind
them
,
instead
of
keep
close
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
He
weep
to
the
southward
until
he
once
more
reach
the
spot
which
contain
the
remain
of
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
He
spend
another
minute
in
grimly
survey
the
ruin
,
and
then
,
glance
down
at
the
footprint
,
follow
their
direction
.
<EOS>
He
have
determine
to
call
the
scamp
to
account
for
the
injury
do
him
.
<EOS>
as
they
belong
to
the
Miami
tribe
,
it
be
quite
likely
they
have
a
boat
with
them
,
though
their
hunting
-
ground
be
east
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
possibly
they
have
other
property
upon
which
the
offend
Shawanoe
mean
to
levy
.
<EOS>
He
follow
the
trail
for
nearly
a
furlong
,
when
it
divide
;
two
of
the
warrior
turn
to
the
left
and
go
deep
into
the
wood
,
while
the
third
continue
down
stream
in
the
same
general
direction
as
before
.
<EOS>
the
sagacious
Shawanoe
suspect
the
truth
;
the
single
Indian
have
go
to
look
after
a
canoe
or
something
which
lie
close
to
the
river
,
while
the
other
be
about
to
engage
in
a
hunt
of
so
kind
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
please
Deerfoot
;
for
,
beside
indicate
that
there
be
a
boat
for
him
to
take
it
show
that
he
have
but
a
single
red
man
to
meet
.
<EOS>
within
less
than
a
hundred
yard
this
solitary
warrior
be
find
.
<EOS>
a
large
canoe
,
evidently
belong
to
the
three
warrior
,
or
possibly
a
large
party
,
lie
against
the
bank
,
with
one
end
on
the
land
,
while
the
other
project
several
yard
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
in
the
stern
sit
an
Indian
,
after
the
fashion
of
a
civilized
man
;
he
be
astride
of
the
end
,
his
moccasin
bang
over
,
one
on
either
side
,
his
back
toward
shore
,
while
he
lean
forward
and
sleepily
watch
a
fish
-
line
,
one
end
of
which
rest
in
his
hand
,
while
the
other
be
far
out
in
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
His
attitude
be
as
lazy
and
content
as
though
he
be
a
white
man
.
<EOS>
It
look
as
if
he
have
choose
the
sport
while
his
companion
be
off
on
a
hunt
that
require
more
effort
and
exertion
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
stand
only
a
few
second
,
when
he
smile
more
fully
than
he
have
do
for
along
time
.
<EOS>
He
see
his
opportunity
,
and
he
proceed
straightway
to
"
improve
"
it
.
<EOS>
He
steal
forward
,
as
quietly
as
a
shadow
,
until
he
have
go
the
few
yard
intervene
.
<EOS>
all
that
he
fear
be
that
the
aboriginal
fisherman
may
obtain
a
bite
before
the
boat
be
reach
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
catch
a
fish
on
his
bone
hook
,
he
would
be
likely
to
fling
him
into
the
canoe
behind
him
and
to
turn
himself
around
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
Deerfoot
place
eye
on
the
motionless
figure
,
he
feel
he
be
master
of
the
situation
;
but
,
with
his
usual
quickness
,
he
have
form

the

lay
his
long
bow
on
the

beside
it

,
stoop
over

he
seize
the
gunwale
with
both
hand
and
,
quickly
as
the
blow
of
a
panther
,
he
jerk
the

slightly
more
than
a

further
up
the

<EOS>
the
result
be
inevitable

<EOS>
the
astonished
Miami
sprawl
forward
from
his
seat
and
go
down
into
the
muddy
Mississippi
out
of
sight
,
doubtless
frightening
away
the
fish
that
be
nibble
at
his
bait
.
<EOS>
“hooh
!
"
<EOS>
he
groan
,
eject
the
water
from
his
mouth
as
he
come
to
view
,
and
follow
it
with
an
expression
much
in
the
nature
of
an
expletive
.
<EOS>
only
a
couple
of
stroke
be
need
to
bring
him
into
the
shallow
water
,
when
he
rise
to
his
foot

walk
out
upon
dry
land

<EOS>
up
to
that
moment
he
do
not
know
the
cause
of
his
mishap
,
for
the
author
stoop
down
on
the
upper
side
of
the
craft
;
but
as
the
Miami
step
out
,
Deerfoot
rise
to
his
full
height
,
with
his
keen
tomahawk
grasp
in
his
left
hand
—
that
be
his
good
one

<EOS>
the
dripping
warrior
,
to
put
it
mildly
,
be
astonish
,
when
he
find
himself
confront
by
the
stranger

<EOS>
He
stand
stare
and
speechless
,
while
the
mouth
of
Deerfoot
again
expand
.
<EOS>
“doe
<EOS>
my

heart
grow
weary
that
he
seek
to
urge
the

to
bite
his
hook

<EOS>
ask
the
Shawanoe
in
the
Miami
tongue

<EOS>
It
be
all
clear
to
the
victim
,
and
,
when
he
understand
the
trick

play
upon
him

his

through

“The

a
fool

he

.
<EOS>
"
His
heart
be
fill
with
joy
when
he
act
like
a
papoose

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
he
will
now
act
like
a

"
say
Deerfoot
,
in
a
sterner
manner
.
<EOS>
"
the
dog
of
the
Miamis
break
the
canoe
of
the
Shawanoe
and
steal
his
blanket
.
<EOS>
”“the
Shawanoe
be
the

say
the
other
with
a
sneer
,

not
without
some
misgiving
,
for

to
use
the
language
of
the
West

the
young
warrior

have
the
drop
on
him

<EOS>
He
have
only
to
make
one
movement
in
order
to
drive
the
glitter
weapon
through
the
skull
of
the
Miami
,
as
though
it
be
mere
card
-
board
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
he
look
very
much
as
if
such
be
his
intention
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
be
the
friend
of
the
white
man
,
"
repeat
the
Shawanoe
;
"
he
hope
to
paddle
them
across
the
great
river
.
<EOS>
the
Miami
dog
have
break
his
canoe
,
so
Deerfoot
will
take
their
boat
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
warrior
show
that
he
be
astound
by
the
daring
of
the
youth

<EOS>
within
the
canoe
lie
the
blanket
of
Deerfoot
,
beside
the
rifle
;
powder
-
horn
,
and
bullet
pouch
,
doubtless
own
by
the
moist
fisherman
.
<EOS>
the
latter
look
at
his
property
as
if
he
could
not
believe
any
one
would
dare
molest
that
;
but
Deerfoot
settle
the
question
in
his
terse
fashion
.
<EOS>
“let
the
dog
of
a
Miami
seat
himself
on
the
ground
like
a
squaw
,
and
watch
his
Shawanoe
master
while
he
take
the
canoe
and
all
that
it
hold
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Miami
stare
at
his
conqueror
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
have
hear
aright

<EOS>
the
conqueror
enlighten
him
.
<EOS>
“the

of
a
Miami
long
to
go
to
the
happy

ground
of
his
father

<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
utter
the
word
,
he
quickly
feint
with
the
hand
grasp
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
the
warrior
make
such
a
sudden
start
to
obey
that
his
moccasin
slip
on
the
wetter
earth
,
his
foot
spread
apart
,
as
though
he
be

to
skate

and
he
sit
down
with
such
a
sudden
bump
that
it
force
a
grunt
from
him

<EOS>
He
hastily
scramble
up
,
and
,
with
a
frightened
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
spring
forward
and
sit
down
again
,
though
the
last
time
be
accord
to
instruction
.
<EOS>
It
require
all
the
self
-
restraint
of
Deerfoot
to
suppress
his
mirth
over
the
ridiculous
performance
of
his
captive
,
if
such
he
may
be
call
.
<EOS>
when
,
the
Miami
seat
himself
with
a
grotesque
effort
at
dignity
,
the
Shawanoe
place
his
bow
in
the
front
of
the
canoe
and
then
shove
the
boat
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
as
it
shoot
from
the
shore
,
he
leap
in
,
and
catch
up
one
of
the
long
three
paddle
with
which
it
be
navigated

<EOS>
dip
it
beneath

make

prodigious
sweep

drive
the
craft
swiftly
ahead

<EOS>
while
thus
employ
the
Miami
faithfully

order

<EOS>
He
sit
immobile
and
silent
,
watch
the
dare
young
warrior
make
off
not
only
with
his
private
property
,
but
with
that
which
belong
to
other
.
<EOS>
the
Miami
must
have
think
to
himself
more
than
once—“ah
,
if
my
comrade
would
only
appear
at
this
moment
!
<EOS>
They
would
make
you
change
your
tune
very
soon

<EOS>
”all
<EOS>
at
once
the
warrior
utter
a
whoop
which
plainly
be
mean
as
a
signal
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
instantly
Deerfoot
lay
down
his
paddle
,
and
,
catch
up
the
gun
,
point
it
at
the
redskin
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
,
turn
a
somersault
backwards
,
and
tumble
and
scramble
into
the
wood
,
desperately
strive
to
get
beyond
sight
of
the
terrible
youth

show
such
recklessness
in

<EOS>
no
doubt
the
Miami
believe
his
escape
be
a
narrow
one
,
when
,
the
next
instant
,
the
rifle
be
discharge
and
the
bullet
cut
through
the
leave
near
his
face
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
in
truth
,
his
escape
be
very
narrow
,
but
it
be
just
as
narrow
as
Deerfoot
choose
to
make
it
.

He
have
not
the
remote

chapter

<EOS>
behind
<EOS>
the
treethe
report
of
the
gun
reach
the
ear
of
Otto
and
Jack
,
and
naturally
cause
them
alarm
.
<EOS>
They
hurriedly
make
their
way
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
peer
out
from
cover
,
not
forget
the
warning
previously
give
by
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
They
have
but
to
look
a
short
distance
down
stream
to
see
the
Shawanoe
paddle
the
large
indian
canoe
toward
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
dere
!
"
exclaim
Otto
.
<EOS>
"
deerfoot
dink
as
how
I
ain'ty
forgotful
,
but
do
not
he
forget
more
than
I
do
,
when
he
dink
he
have
us
in
the
canoe
<EOS>
and
we
be
here?”“There
<EOS>
be
no
danger
of
that
,
"
say
Jack
;
"
he
know
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
come
after
us
,
for
the
Indians
would
shoot
him
from
this
side
.
<EOS>
”'“Why
would
dey
do
dem
things?”“because
<EOS>
it
be
the
nature
of
Indians
to
revenge
themselves
that
way
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
he
have
take
their
canoe
,
and
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
kill
one
or
two
of
their
warrior
before
he
be
able
to
get
off
with
it
.
<EOS>
that
shoot
which
we
hear
be
probably
fire
at
him
.
<EOS>
”but
<EOS>
in
this
instance
the
ear
of
the
German
prove
more
correct
than
those
of
the
American
.
<EOS>
He
have
notice
that
the
gun
be
discharge
from
the
river
,
establish
the
fact
that
it
be
fire
by
Deerfoot
,
though
Jack
Carleton
could
not
understand
the
reason
why
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
that
the
Shawanoe
mean
to
cross
to
the
other
side
the
Mississippi
,
in
order
to
throw
the
Miamis
"
off
the
trail
"
—
that
is
,
he
would
keep
out
of
their
sight
until
be
gain
a
chance
to
return
for
his
friend
.
<EOS>
It
occur
at
once
to
the
young
kentuckian
that
such
be
the
case
,
the
situation
of
himself
and
Otto
be
one
of
considerable
danger
.
<EOS>
the
high
-
handed
course
of
the
Shawanoe
would
rouse
the
enmity
of
the
Miamis
to
the
high
point
.
<EOS>
revenge
be
one
of
the
most
marked
characteristic
of
the
American
Indian
,
who
be
eager
to
retaliate
upon
the
innocent
when
he
can
not
reach
the
guilty
.
<EOS>
the
three
who
have
suffer
the
indignity
could
easily
follow
the
trail
of
the
boy
,
wheresoever
it
may
lead
,
except
through
water
.
<EOS>
what
,
therefore
,
be
more
likely
than
that
they
would
seek
to
adjust
matter
by
slay
those
who
have
take
no
hand
in
the
capture
of
the
canoe?jack
know
that
there
be
only
three
Miamis
directly
concern
,
but
Deerfoot
have
speak
of
other
in
the
neighborhood
,
beside
which
the
young
Kentuckian
himself
have
see
a
couple
of
Shawanoes
,
only
a
few
hour
before
,
at
no
great
distance
from
that
very
spot
.
<EOS>
when
he
make
know
his
fear
to
Otto
,
the
latter
agree
they
be
in
great
peril
,
and
the
utmost
care
be
necessary
to
keep
clear
of
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
the
precise
course
good
to
adopt
be
hard
to
determine
,
but
they
begin
a
guard
departure
from
the
spot
,
step
as
carefully
and
lightly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
though
Otto
Relstaub
,
like
his
,
parent
,
have
never
be
able
to
handle
the
english
language
intelligently
,
and
though
he
be
afflict
with
a
forgetfulness
all
too
common
with
most
boy
of
his
age
,
yet
his
life
on
the
frontier
have
not
be
without
its
lesson
to
him
.
<EOS>
at
time
he
show
a
shrewdness
and
knowledge
of
woodcraft
which
surprise
Jack
Carleton
,
who
often
become
impatient
with
his
shortsightedness
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
he
second
the
effort
of
his
companion
to
mislead
the
Indians
,
know
to
be
close
at
hand
,
certainly
be
deserve
of
high
praise
.
<EOS>
the
friend
advance
some
twenty
rod
or
more
,
Otto
keep
close
behind
Jack
,
without
see
or
hear
anything
of
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
look
across
the
Mississippi
,
nothing
be
observe
of
Deerfoot
or
his
canoe
,
so
that
no
help
be
to
be
expect
for
many
hour
from
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Jack
be
confident
that
nothing
of
the
kind
could
be
do
before
night
,
when
the
matchless
Shawanoe
would
have
the
darkness
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
to
the
young
Kentuckian
,
the
advent
of
Deerfoot
be
of
that
nature
that
he
fail
to
see
that
it
have
accomplish
any
good
.
<EOS>
if
he
and
Otto
could
gain
a
suitable
start
,
they
would
swim
across
.
<EOS>
“Sh
!
"
whisper
the
German
,
reach
forward
and
catch
the
arm
of
his

<EOS>
”“what
<EOS>
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
alarmed
Jack
,
as
he
turn
hastily
about
.
<EOS>
“let
you
go
dot
way

me
go

<EOS>
”rather
<EOS>
curiously
,
the
leader
be
ask
himself
at
that
moment
whether
something
could
not
be
gain
by
him
and
Otto
separate
and
afterward
meeting
at
some
point
further
up
stream
.
<EOS>
such
,
as
be
well
know
,
be
the
practice
of
the
Apaches
when
hotly
pursue
to
their
mountain
fastness
.
<EOS>
a
large
company
will
dissolve
into
its
"
original
element
,
"
as
may
be
say
,
render
pursuit
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
wisdom
of
this
course
on
the
part
of
Jack
and
Otto
may
well
be
question
,
but
,
without
give
the
matter
any
thought
,
the
young
Kentuckian
act
upon
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
“You
keep
close
to
the
river
,
"
he
say
,
"
while
I
turn
to
the
right
,
and
will
come
back
to
the
shore
a
few
hundred
yard
above
.
<EOS>
We
will
use
our
old
signal
if
we
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
”otto
nod
his
bead
to
signify
that
he
understand
the
arrangement
,
and
,
without
another
word
,
the
two
diverge
,
speedily
lose
sight
of
each
other
in
the
wood
,
which
show
more
under
growth
than
that
through
which
they
pass
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
“I
declare
,
"
say
Jack
to
himself
,
before
he
have
go
far
,
"
I
much
misgive
myself
whether
this
be
go
to
help
matter
;
it
must
be
a
good
deal
easy
for
the
Indians
to
pick
up
one
of
us
at
a
time
,
than
it
be
to
take
the
two
together
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
good
after
all
,
"
he
add
a
minute
later
,
with
the
natural
hopefulness
of
his
nature
,
"
for
I
learn
long
ago
that
if
two
or
three
hunter
separate
while
in
the
indian
country
,
they
can
take
well
care
of
themselves
than
if
they
stay
together
.
<EOS>
”He
stand
still
and
look
and
listen
.
<EOS>
the
wood
,
as
have
be
say
,
be
dense
than
that
to
which
he
have
be
accustom
,
and
,
when
he
use
his
eye
to
the
utmost
,
he
see
nothing
to
cause
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
lynx
-
eye
Miamis
could
follow
his
trail
with
little
trouble
,
no
matter
how
much
be
seek
to
conceal
it
,
and
the
fact
that
he
see
and
hear
nothing
could
be
no
proof
that
danger
itself
be
not
near
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
be
sure
those
be
Shawanoes
that
I
see
yesterday
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
and
yet
Deerfoot
insist
they
be
Miamis
who
break
up
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
wonder
whether
there
be
a
war
party
of
both—”The
bright
eye
of
the
youth
at
that
very
moment
tell
him
a
singular
fact
:
only
a
short
distance
in
front
of
him
stand
two
red
man
in
their
war
paint
.
<EOS>
They
be
talk
together
and
have
their
back
toward
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
be
so
motionless
,
that
he
have
fail
to
see
them
in
the
first
place
,
and
would
have
fail
again
but
for
the
low
,
guttural
murmur
of
their
voice
.
<EOS>
Jack
instantly
step
behind
the
large
trunk
of
a
tree
and
peer
out
with
an
interest
that
may
well
be
understand
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
the
youth
should
have
approach
so
close
without
detection
,
but
it
be
complimentary
to
his
woodcraft
that
such
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
subject
of
conversation
between
the
Indians
,
they
speedily
become
absorb
in
it
,
their
arm
saw
the
air
,
and
their
voice
rise
to
it
pitch
that
carry
the
sound
far
beyond
where
he
stand
.
<EOS>
Their
interest
in
the
discussion
frequently
bring
the
profile
of
the
further
one
into
view
and
show
so
much
of
his
front
,
that
his
tribal
character
be
settle
beyond
question
;
he
be
a
Shawanoe
,
one
of
the
dreaded
people
who
do
more
than
any
other
to
earn
the
name
of
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
for
one
section
of
the
Union
.
<EOS>
It
be
establish
,
therefore
,
that
there
be
two
distinct
party
in
that
particular
section
.
<EOS>
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
be
natural
ally
,
and
there
could
be
no
question
that
a
perfect
understanding
exist
between
those
who
give
our
friend
so
much
concern
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
be
debate
with
himself
whether
it
would
be
a
safe
undertaking
for
him
to
withdraw
,
and
,
venture
further
into
the
wood
,
seek
to
flank
the
warrior
who
have
rise
so
unexpectedly
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
be
so
delayed
that
his
agreement
with
Otto
be
likely
to
be
disarrange
,
and
it
would
not
do
to
stay
too
long
where
he
have
halt
.
<EOS>
before
a
conclusion
be
form
,
the
interview
between
the
couple
end
.
<EOS>
They
abruptly
cease
talk
,
and
one
start
north
and
the
other
south
.
<EOS>
as
they
do
so
Jack
learn
another
significant
fact
—
they
belong
to
different
tribe
.
<EOS>
the
one
who
go
northward
look
squarely
in
the
face
of
his
friend
,
just
before
move
out
,
and
,
in
do
so
,
give
the
good
view
of
his
countenance
that
the
boy
have
yet
obtain
.
<EOS>
that
view
reveal
him
as
a
Miami
beyond
all
question
.
<EOS>
the
other
wheeled
about
and
advance
almost
in
a
direct
line
toward
Jack
,
who
feel
that
his
situation
be
become
very
delicate
and
peculiar
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
tribe
of
that
warrior
,
who
be
a
splendid
'
speciman
of
physical
vigor
and
manhood
.
<EOS>
Jack
suspect
that
he
be
not
only
a
Shawanoe
,
but
be
a
chief
or
leader
.
<EOS>
the
hideous
paint
which
be
smear
over
his
repulsive
face
,
be
more
elaborate
than
in
the
case
of
the
two
from
whom
the
youth
effect
such
a
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
that
which
Jack
see
confirm
his
belief
of
a
perfect
understanding
between
the
different
party
.
<EOS>
They
probably
number
a
dozen
altogether
,
and
have
determine
to
bring
the
friendly
indian
and
two
white
man
to
account
for
the
outrage
of
the
young
Shawanoe
—
for
,
brief
as
be
the
time
mince
it
have
be
perpetrate
,
it
be
more
than
probable
that
it
be
know
to
all
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
wish
that
heathen
would
take
it
into
his
head
to
move
some
other
way
,
"
think
Jack
to
himself
,
as
he
draw
his
head
back
,
fearful
of
be
see
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
come
straight
on
,
he
will
bump
his
forehead
against
this
tree
,
and
,
if
he
turn
out
,
he
will
pass
so
close
to
the
trunk
that
I
have
get
to
be
lively
if
he
do
not
run
against
me
.
”listene
<EOS>
intently
,
he
be
able
to
hear
the
soft
footfall
of
the
warrior
upon
the
leave
,
scarcely
louder
than
the
faint
tipping
of
the
claw
of
a
small
bird
.
<EOS>
have
the
Shawanoe
suspect
there
be
the
slight
need
for
care
,
his
tread
would
have
be
silent
.
<EOS>
a
few
second
pass
when
the
delicate
sound
cease
.
<EOS>
what
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
do
the
indian
suspect
the
truth
?
<EOS>
be
he
stand
motionless
,
or
be
he
advance
with
that
noiseless
step
which
the
ear
of
the
listen
indian
himself
fail
to
note?These
be
the
question
which
the
young
Kentuckian
ask
,
and
which
for
the
time
be
could
not
answer
.
<EOS>
He
shrink
close
to
the
bark
of
the
tree
,
with
his
gun
clasp
and
the
hammer
raise
ready
to
fire
at
an
instant
's
notice
.
<EOS>
know
<EOS>
so
well
the
subtlety
of
the
red
man
<EOS>
,
it
occur
to
Jack
that
his
foe
perhaps
be
stealthily
flank
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
move
to
one
side
and
the
moment
he
could
gain
a
shot
he
would
fire
.
<EOS>
the
suspense
become
more
trying
than
disaster
itself
could
be
,
and
Jack
determine
to
end
it
by
learn
the
precise
situation
of
the
Shawanoe
,
and
what
he
be
likely
to
attempt
to
do
in
the
way
of
hostility

CHAPTER
IX
.
<EOS>
a
TIMELY
ARRIVALOne
of
the
most
convincing
evidence
of
a
power
beyond
our
comprehension
,
govern
and
direct
everything
for
the
good
,
be
the
marvelous
degree
to
which
the
different
faculty
of
our
nature
can
be
train
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
skill
which
can
not
be
explain
or
understand
by
him
who
attain
it
;
and
,
interweave
through
the
five
sense
which
science
assign
to
us
,
seem
to
be
a
sixth
not
yet
understand
,
of
whose
wonderful
function
every
one
of
us
have
see
proof
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
warrior
,
after
part
with
his
companion
,
walk
leisurely
toward
the
tree
behind
which
the
young
Kentuckian
be
hide
,
until
about
twenty
yard
separate
them
.
<EOS>
then
he
stop
as
abruptly
as
if
stricken
by
a
thunderbolt
.
<EOS>
there
be
"
something
in
the
air
"
which
whisper
danger
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
have
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
to
cause
this
misgiving
,
but
he
know
that
peril
confront
him
.
<EOS>
what
he
would
have
do
in
the
event
of
Jack
Carleton
remain
silent
and
stationary
behind
the
trunk
can
only
be
conjecture
;
but
the
impatience
of
the
youth
end
that
phase
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
softly
remove
his
cap
,
the
young
Kentuckian
slowly
move
the
side
of
his
head
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
he
keep
his
face
in
a
perpendicular
position
,
so
that
the
least
possible
part
of
his
head
be
expose
.
<EOS>
have
he
incline
it
,
the
upper
portion
would
have
show
before
the
eye
could
have
be
bring
into
use
.
<EOS>
the
first
object
on
which
Jack
's
vision
rest
be
the
Shawanoe
warrior
,
stand
erect
,
one
foot
slightly
advanced
and
both
hand
grasp
the
rifle
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
the
face
be
daub
and
streak
with
paint
,
and
the
gleam
black
eye
be
look
straight
at
the
startled
youth
.
<EOS>
like
a
flash
the
dusky
arm
bring
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
and
it
be
safe
to
say
that
Jack
Carleton
never
in
all
his
life
draw
back
his
head
with
such
celerity
.
<EOS>
quick
as
be
the
Indian
,
he
be
not
quick
enough
to
catch
the
lad
,
who
,
it
will
be
see
,
have
very
little
to
do
in
order
to
save
himself
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
with
a
faint
whoop
,
the
redskin
bound
behind
the
near
tree
,
and
,
with
his
cocked
rifle
at
command
,
await
an
opening
that
would
allow
him
to
slay
his
foe
.
<EOS>
thus
the
two
occupy
precisely
the
same
,
relative
position
;
each
be
protect
by
a
trunk
of
a
tree
large
enough
to
shield
his
body
,
and
each
grasp
a
loaded
and
cocked
rifle
,
eager
to
use
it
the
instant
the
opportunity
present
itself
.
<EOS>
who
be
to
win
in
this
curious
contest
?
<EOS>
look
at
the
situation
dispassionately
,
it
must
be
admit
that
the
chance
favor
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
He
be
old
,
strong
,
more
active
,
and
possess
great
cunning
than
do
the
youth
.
<EOS>
what
,
after
all
,
be
one
of
the
most
important
factor
in
such
a
problem
,
the
american
race
possess
by
training
,
and
nature
—
patience
scarcely
second
to
that
of
the
Esquimau
.
<EOS>
the
probability
be
that
the
Shawanoe
would
wait
until
the
youth
be
lead
into
some
fatal
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
be
it
remember
,
be
base
on
the
condition
that
no
such
thing
as
"
foreign
interference
"
take
place
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
reader
of
mine
who
have
not
be
entertain
in
his
early
youth
by
the
story
of
the
white
man
and
the
Indian
,
who
,
be
place
in
the
situation
of
Jack
and
the
Shawanoe
,
remain
in
hide
from
each
other
,
until
the
Caucasian
draw
the
shot
of
the
American
,
by
place
his
cap
on
the
end
of
the
ramrod
or
gun
and
project
it
far
enough
from
behind
the
tree
,
thus
lead
the
Indian
to
believe
that
the
head
of
his
foe
be
in
range
?
<EOS>
if
such
an
incident
ever
take
place
,
the
warrior
must
have
be
unusually
stupid
to
leap
from
cover
,
as
the
story
make
him
do
,
until
certain
he
have
bring
the
other
down
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
attempt
the
same
artifice
,
except
that
,
instead
of
take
the
trouble
to
draw
his
ramrod
or
use
his
rifle
for
that
purpose
,
he
hold
his
cap
in
hand
,
shove
it
forward
very
slowly
and
with
great
care
,
the
trick
fail
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
must
have
suspect
the
truth
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
head
-
gear
.
<EOS>
Jack
push
it
forward
until
sure
it
be
see
,
but
no
demonstration
come
from
the
warrior
,
who
,
for
aught
the
youth
know
,
be
essay
the
same
deception
.
<EOS>
determine
to
learn
something
about
his
enemy
,
Jack
throw
his
head
to
one
side
and
draw
it
back
again
before
the
warrior
could
pull
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
He
know
precisely
where
to
look
,
but
he
be
unable
to
catch
sight
of
the
Shawanoe
or
his
weapon
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
whether
he
have
shift
his
quarter
,
"
say
Jack
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
have
,
he
will
shot
at
me
before
I
can
learn
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
holloa!”the
second
time
he
thrust
forward
his
face
withdraw
it
with
the
same
celerity
as
before
,
he
catch
a
pass
glimpse
of
the
Shawanoe
,
who
,
rather
curiously
,
adopt
exactly
the
same
artifice
.
<EOS>
this
"
locate
"
the
savage
and
relieve
Jack
,
for
the
moment
,
of
his
terrifying
dread
that
death
threaten
from
an
unknown
point
.
<EOS>
but
,
within
the
next
minute
,
the
redskin
utterance
to
a
faint
whoop
,
clearly
mean
as
a
signal
to
a
comrade
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
“He
be
call
back
the
Miami
,
who
leave
him
a
few
minute
ago
,
"
be
the
conclusion
of
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
go
rough
with
me
if
I
have
two
of
them
to
fight
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
a
little
of
the
signal
myself

<EOS>
”place
<EOS>
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
against
his
tongue
,
he
emit
a
low
,
tremulous
whistle
,
such
as
he
and
Otto
use
when
on
hunt
expedition
together
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
it
,
and
then
,
greatly
to
his
relief
,
receive
a
reply
,
though
it
be
so
guard
that
he
could
not
guess
<EOS>
the
point
whence
it
come
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
if
Otto
prove
sharp
enough
to
grasp
the
situation
,
without
run
into
ambush
,
we
may
settle
the
matter
with
this
fellow
before
the
other
can
take
a
hand—”As
on
the
previous
day
,
something
twinkle
among
the
tree
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
a
glance
in
that
direction
and
Jack
see
,
with
dismay
,
that
the
Miami
warrior
have
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
bad
of
it
,
too
,
be
that
he
appear
so
far
over
from
where
the
Shawanoe
stand
that
line
connect
the
three
would
have
make
almost
a
right
angle
.
<EOS>
It
look
as
if
the
youth
must
be
expose
to
the
enfilade
fire
of
one
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
frightful
situation
,
but
the
brave
Kentuckian
do
not
lose
heart
.
<EOS>
He
press
against
the
bark
as
closely
as
he
could
,
endeavor
to
watch
both
point
,
but
he
be
fearfully
handicapped
,
and
there
be
little
hope
for
him
,
unless
his
friend
could
interfere
.
<EOS>
suddenly
the
Miami
,
who
,
naturally
enough
,
have
take
to
the
shelter
of
a
tree
,
after
the
manner
of
his
comrade
,
make
a
bound
of
several
foot
which
place
him
behind
a
second
trunk
that
be
still
further
to
the
rear
of
Jack
Carleton
.
<EOS>
another
such
leap
and
the
youth
would
be
effectually
uncover
.
<EOS>
but
the
anxiously
pray
for
deliverance
come
at
this
critical
moment

<EOS>
while

for

Otto

behind

,
in
the

eye

<EOS>
unexpected
discovery
of
his
mortal
peril
throw
the
Miami
into
a
panic

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
find
shelter
at
the

moment
from
both
his

for
,
on

side

he

with
a
howl
of
consternation
,
he
whirl
on
his
heel
and
run
like
a
frightened
deer

<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
he
duck
his

leap
from
side
to
side

after
the
manner
of
the
Digger
Indians
of
the
present
day
,
with
a
view
of

the
fire
of

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
feat
of
marksmanship

either
lad
bring
him
down
,
when
so
many
and
varying
object
intervene

neither

when

terrified
fugitive

he
be
without

give
no

side

astonished
Jack

<EOS>
“Now

be
not
dot
funny
?
<EOS>
He
Indian

not

he

He
will
shoot

if
you

glance
affrightedly
behind
him
,
as
though
he
hear
a
stealthy
footstep
,
but
call
back
once
more
that
the
Shawanoe
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
the
other
youth
,
just
then
,
that
if
the
warrior
be
in
the
vicinity
and
could
be
see
by
Otto
,
he
must
be
visible
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
a
sweeping
survey
of
the
field
fail
to
bring
to
light
the
paint
face
and
feather
crown
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
Shawanoe
have
take
advantage
of
the
diversion
cause
by
Otto
's
arrival
,
and
have
not
stand
on
the
order
of
his
go
.
<EOS>
five
minute
before
,
there
seem
no
chance
of
Jack
Carleton
preserve
his
life
.
<EOS>
now
,
how
changed
!
<EOS>
toward
whatever
point
of
the
compass
he
look
,
he
see
not
the
first
evidence
that
peril
threaten
.
<EOS>
but
for
all
that
,
it
be
uncomfortably
nigh
,
and
it
be
difficult
to
find
a
place
in
which
there
be
less
safety
than
where
they
be
.
<EOS>
Jack
resolve
to
leave
at
once
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
he
step
from
behind
the
tree
which
have
shelter
him

Otto
stride
toward
him
,
his
broad
face
still
broad
on
account
of
his
beam
pleasure

“Dot

I

never

it

Otto

though
I
think
it
be
a
mistake
when
we
part
company
it
short
while
ago

<EOS>
It
look
as
though
these
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
be
on
all
side
of
us
,
and
we
must
find
some
kind
of

every

,
somehow

I

there
be

anywhere

”“I

lead
him
to
be

most
trying

“I

CHAPTER
X.
AT
baywhile
Jack
and
Otto
be
talk
in
guard
tone
,
and
carefully
pick
their
way
through
the
wood
,
each
stop
and
become
silent
at
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
They
see
nothing
,
but
their
ear
tell
them
some
person
or
animal
be
approach
through
the
undergrowth
behind
them
.
<EOS>
within
the
same
minute
the
creature
reveal
himself
in
the
form
of
a
large
,
black
bear
,
which
be
lumber
along
unmindful
that
enemy
be
near
.
<EOS>
“Mebbe
<EOS>
he
do
not
be
an
Indian
,
"
whisper
Otto
,
who
know
much
of
the
cunning
of
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
the
same
thought
have
occur
to
the
Kentuckian
,
who
hold
his
gun
at
full
cock
,
until
he
should
be
able
to
learn
the
truth
.
<EOS>
while
thus
employ
be
could
not
help
reflect
on
the
improbability
of
such
a
clumsy
artifice
be
that
time
,
for
there
be
no
call
for
the
attempt
,
no
prospect
of
deceive
two
person
who
display
such
excellent
woodcraft
.
<EOS>
Jack
speedily
see
that
the
bear
be
a
genuine
one
,
probably
on
his
way
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
there
no
occasion
for
shoot
him
,
and
the
hunter
step
aside
to
allow
him
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Jack
keep
eye
on
him
,
however
,
for
it
be
the
spring
of
year
,
he
have
not
be
long
out
of
his
hibernate
quarter
,
and
be
likely
to
be
lean
,
hungry
,
fierce
.
<EOS>
bruin
catch
sight
of
the
hunter
,
while
several
rod
off
,
and
throw
up
his
snout
,
take
a
look
at
them
,
as
though
uncertain
of
the
specie
to
which
they
belong
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
look
pig
,
do
not
he
?
"
<EOS>
say
Otto
,
refer
to
his
size
,
and
half
inclined
to
give
him
a
shot
.
<EOS>
"
one
pullet
would
make
him
put
up
dot
snout
down
.
<EOS>
”“let
him
alone
,
so
long
as
he
do
not
disturb
us
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
half
so
dangerous
as
the
Indians
and
they
would
be
likely
to
rush
upon
us
before
you
could
reload
your
gun
.
<EOS>
”otto
<EOS>
see
the
prudence
of
his
friend
's
word
,
and
he
not
only
let
down
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
,
but
emphasize
his
intention
by
turn
his
back
upon
the
bear
.
<EOS>
the
huge
beast
seem
disposed
to
attack
the
boy
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
the
plump
,
ruddy
-
faced
Gorman
look
specially
tempting
to
him
while
in
his
hungry
state
,
for
Jack
fancy
that
it
be
he
on
whom
his
large
eye
be
fix
with
a
peculiar
lodging
.
<EOS>
the
bear
take
several
step
toward
the
couple
,
and
Jack
cock
his
gun
,
believe
he
would
have
to
fire
.
<EOS>
Otto
,
see
the
movement
,
turn
,
but
at
that
moment
the
animal
,
if
he
have
actually
any
purpose
of
open
hostility
,
change
his
mind
,
move
off
to
one
side
,
and
continue
his
awkward
gait
toward
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
boy
watch
him
until
be
reach
the
stream
and
begin
lap
the
water
,
when
they
resume
their
withdrawal
from
the
spot
,
still
walk
in
a
northerly
course
along
the
right
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
both
be
anxious
to
get
as
far
away
as
they
could
,
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
able
to
keep
a
safe
space
between
themselves
and
the
red
man
,
whom
they
hold
in
such
fear
.
<EOS>
Their
uneasiness
be
not
lessen
when
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
break
upon
their
ear
,
from
a
point
not
far
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
It
be
follow
by
another
report
deeper
in
the
wood
,
and
then
several
whoop
come
from
different
part
of
the
forest
,
all
be
within
a
short
radius
.
<EOS>
the
boy
could
not
guess
the
cause
of
the
firing
,
unless
they
be
mean
as
signal
,
but
they
be
sure
the
cry
refer
to
them
.
<EOS>
most
likely
,
as
they
view
it
,
they
be
mean
to
direct
the
action
of
the
party
,
who
must
have
feel
that
it
only
need
a
little
care
and
energy
to
capture
the
youth
that
,
up
to
that
time
,
have
baffle
the
enmity
of
both
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
the
result
be
,
that
Jack
and
Otto
,
keep
as
near
as
be
prudent
to
the
river
,
push
on
as
fast
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
a
specie
of
run
vine
close
to
the
ground
cause
them
much
annoyance
,
the
more
chubby
one
fall
forward
several
time
on
his
hand
and
knee
.
<EOS>
They
have
travel
a
short
distance
only
,
when
the
signal
that
have
so
alarm
them
be
hear
again
.
<EOS>
the
Indiana
call
to
each
other
by
mean
of
the
whoop
and
shout
,
as
intelligible
to
those
for
whom
they
be
mean
as
if
they
be
so
many
spoken
word
.
<EOS>
the
lad
could
not
fail
to
observe
that
they
be
considerably
near
than
before
.
<EOS>
the
red
man
be
evidently
converge
in
their
pursuit
,
and
mean
to
force
the
struggle
to
an
issue
with
the
least
delay
possible
.
<EOS>
“We
must
travel
faster
,
"
say
Jack
Carleton
,
compress
his
lip
,
after
glance
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"
this
have
settle
down
to
a
regular
race
between

”“Dot

so

"
assent
Otto
,
sprawl
forward
again
on
his
hand
and

,
from
the
run
vine

catch

like
fine
wire

around
his

”It
<EOS>
seem
to
be
the
only
recourse
leave
to
the
fugitive
,
and
they
turn
toward
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
but
at
that
very
moment
Jack
catch
sight
of
a
pile
of
log
only
a
short
distance
ahead
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
direct
interference
of
Providence
,
totally
unexpected
by
both
.
<EOS>
whether
the
log
be
the
retreat
of
a
friend
or
enemy
could
only
be
guess
.
<EOS>
the
probability
be
that
the
former
be
the
case

<EOS>
Jack

him
back

“Vot

half
angrily
at
the
check

there
be
so
much
necessity
for
haste

<EOS>
“See

<EOS>
ask
Jack
,
in
turn

to
the
log

through
the
tree

<EOS>
Otto
nod
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
,
and
he
make
a
desperate
rush
to
reach
the
refuge
,
catch
his
foot
and
fall
headlong
again
.
<EOS>
“Dunderation
!

he
exclaim
;

if

not
no

<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
whoop
of
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
sound
still
closer
;
they
be
press
the
pursuit
with
utmost
vigor
,
and
be
upon
the
heel
of
the
fugitive

<EOS>
the
Kentuckian
,
who
continually
glance
back
,
catch
sight
of
more
than
one
figure
flit
among
the
tree

<EOS>
suddenly
something
red
gleam
;
it
be
the
flash
of
a
gun
,
and
,
at
the
same
moment
the
sharp
report
ring
out
,
the
bullet
pass
between
Jack
and
Otto

who
be
strive
desperately
to
get
beyond
reach
before
a
fair
aim
could
tempt
their
enemy

<EOS>
the
second
view
which
Jack
catch
of
the
shelter
tell
him
it
be
simply
four
wall
of
log

a
dozen

half

without

why

no

“I

as
Otto
Relstaub
reach
that
point
in
his
remark
,
he
pull
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
.
<EOS>
a
rasp

and
the
horrible
face
vanish
a
speedily
as
if
the
owner
have

which

“Yaw

repeat
Otto
,
coolly
lower
his
gun
and
look
at
the
spot
where
the

and
shoulder
be
visible
an
instant
before

<EOS>
“load
up
quick
!
"
<EOS>
say
Jack
,
who
hold
his
cocked
rifle
in
hand
while
his
eye
glance
hastily
along
the
upper
part
of
the
log
,
"
do
not
lose
a
second
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
thump
of
the
body
be
hear
as
the
Shawanoe
—
dead
before
he
could
fall
the
brief
space
—
strike
the
ground
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
a
second
warrior
(
a
Miami
that
time
)
,
draw
himself
upward
close
to
the
place
from
which
the
Shawanoe
have
drop
.
<EOS>
He
rise
until
his
tufted
head
,
his
sloping
forehead
and
his
gleaming
eye
appear
just
above
the
horizon
of
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
stare
downward
,
he
look
straight
into
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
,
hold
by
a
young
Kentuckian
,
who
have
just
become
aware
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
down
go
the
Indian
,
possibly
with
a
suspicion
that
his
bronze
skull
be
also
perforate
,
as
he
fall
across
the
limp
body
beneath
him
;
but
Jack
Carleton
have
not
fire
,
not
because
the
opportunity
be
not
invite
enough
nor
because
he
feel
the
least
scruple
about
shoot
one
of
the
savage
who
be
thirst
for
his
life
,
but
he
be
afraid
to
discharge
his
piece
before
Otto
should
force
another
bullet
home
.
<EOS>
repeating
and
percussion
rifle
be
unknown
at
that
day
,
and
it
take
much
valuable
time
to
reload
musket
or
gun
after
its
discharge
.
<EOS>
know
this
,
the
infuriate
redskin
be
likely
to
make
a
rush
whenever
they
know
that
the
weapon
within
the
enclosure
be
unload
.
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the
boy
possess
no
other
firearm
,
it
will
be
see
that
in
such
an
event
they
would
be
helpless
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
impossible
for
them
to
hold
out
if
their
assailant
determine
to
force
matter
.
<EOS>
They
have
but
to
leap
over
the
wall
,
as
could
be
easily
do
,
and
the
contest
would
be
decide
right
speedily
;
that
decision
must
inevitably
be
against
the
dare
defender

<EOS>
CHAPTER
XI
.
<EOS>
a
primitive
<EOS>
fortthe
sharp
repulse
of
the
Indians
delay
rush
which
,
as
have
be
say
,
could
end
only
in
the
discomfiture
of
the
defender
.
<EOS>
the
occurrence
prove
that
the
first
warrior
to
scale
the
wall
be
certain
to
share
the
fate
of
him
who
have
already
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
with
such
knowledge
it
would
be
unnatural
to
expect
any
Shawanoe
or
Miami
to
throw
himself
into
the
breach
,
since
,
as
a
rule
,
man
be
not
anxious
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
other
.
<EOS>
the
brief
respite
thus
afford
Jack
and
Otto
enable
them
to
make
a
close
survey
of
the
shelter
which
have
present
itself
so
providentially
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
find
little
not
apparent
to
their
terrified
gaze
when
they
scramble
within
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
four
wall
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
with
that
morbid
interest
in
trifle
thing
which
often
manifest
itself
in
the
most
critical
moment
,
Otto
count
the
log
on
each
of
the
four
side
.
<EOS>
“dere

nine
dere

"
say
he
,
indicate
the
western
side
,
"
ten
dere
,
and
nine
and
ten
on
de
other
side
.
<EOS>
”“that
must
be
right
,
"
remark
Jack
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
make
them
the
same
.
<EOS>
”“Tis
funny
dat
<EOS>
we
bofe
count
dem
at
de
same
tine
,
when
each
one
be
not
do
it
togedder
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
only
entrance
to
the
enclosure
,
as
it
seem
proper
to
call
it
,
be
the
one
use
by
the
boy
.
<EOS>
nothing
to
suggest
a
door
,
or
any
purpose
of
make
one
,
be
to
be
see
on
any
side
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
impossible
that
some
hunter
,
who
have
encamp
in
the
vicinity
,
have
start
the
structure
with
the
intention
of
roof
it
over
,
and
of
provide
some
original
mean
of
ingress
and
egress
which
be
not
apparent
to
the
little
garrison
.
<EOS>
convinced
that
they
would
not
be
disturb
for
some
time
to
come
,
Jack
hastily
search
for
loophole
,
with
which
it
would
seem
the
structure
ought
to
have
be
provide
,
but
nothing
of
the
kind
be
discover
.
<EOS>
whoever
have
hew
and
put
together
the
log
,
have
do
so
with
admirable
skill
.
<EOS>
the
gap
in
the
end
have
be
cut
with
a
nicety
that
make
a
perfect
fit
in
every
case
.
<EOS>
have
the
house
be
complete
,
it
certainly
would
have
be
a
substantial
one
.
<EOS>
while
the
absence
of
loop
-
hole
remove
to
a
great
extent
the
fear
of
treacherous
shot
from
the
outside
,
yet
in
another
respect
it
be
an
annoyance
.
<EOS>
the
boy
could
see
nothing
of
their
assailant
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
hearing
and
conjecture
it
lelf
be
all
that
be
leave
to
inform
them
of
what
be
go
on
so
near
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
the
Indians
,
after
drive
the
youth
into
shelter
,
would
leave
them
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
the
death
of
one
of
their
warrior
be
enough
to
rouse
the
passion
of
revenge
to
the
high
point
—
a
necessity
which
,
as
show
by
the
incident
already
narrate
,
do
not
exist
.
<EOS>
when
Jack
and
Otto
be
give
a
little
time
for
reflection
,
they
be
force
to
see
that
their
situation
be
hopeless
.
<EOS>
every
advantage
be
with
their
enemy
,
who
,
if
they
choose
to
save
themselves
the
risk
of
a
determined
assault
,
have
only
to
wait
.
<EOS>
without
food
or
water
,
with
no
means
of
leave
the
place
,
the
hour
must
surely
come
when
exhausted
nature
would
compel
this
little
garrison
to
yield
.
<EOS>
the
boy
's
be
many
mile
from
the
settlement
on
either
side
of
the
river
,
and
there
be
no
means
of
send
word
to
their
friend
of
the
dire
strait
in
which
they
be
place
.
<EOS>
even
could
such
message
reach
Coatesville
,
or
the
cabin
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
several
day
must
necessarily
elapse
before
assistance
could
arrive
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
's
thought
naturally
turn
to
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
so
many
story
of
his
wonderful
woodcraft
and
skill
that
he
lean
upon
him
,
when
he
be
present
to
lean
upon
;
but
,
hopeful
as
be
the
nature
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
he
could
gather
no
crumb
of
comfort
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
have
cross
the
river
in
the
Miami
canoe
,
and
could
not
be
expect
to
return
until
under
cover
of
darkness
.
<EOS>
even
then
he
must
be
powerless
.
<EOS>
there
be
limit
to
all
human
skill
,
and
what
great
folly
than
to
expect
him
to
release
two
boy
,
shut
in
a
log
enclosure
,
and
surround
by
a
score
or
less
of
vigilant
indian
warrior
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
the
nature
of
either
Jack
or
Otto
,
to
yield
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
so
long
as
they
could
fight
off
the
dread
end
,
so
long
they
would
put
,
forth
every
effort
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
for
fifteen
minute
after
the
discharge
of
gun
absolute
silence
prevail
.
<EOS>
not
the
slight
rustling
tell
of
the
crouch
savage
without

<EOS>
the
boy
lean
against
the
log
of
wait
and
listen
.
<EOS>
during
the
interval
,
the
young
Kentuckian
become
fill
with
irresistible
curiosity
to
learn
what
their
enemy
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
they
be
plot
mischief
,
but
he
could
form
no
idea
of
its
nature
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
gain
the
covet
knowledge
?
<EOS>
manifestly
there
be
but
the
one
way
.
<EOS>
“Otto
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
be
go
to
climb
up
the
log
and
look
over
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>

off

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
exclaim
his
horrified
friend

<EOS>
“I'll
come

that
sooner
or
later
any
way

"
be
the
reply
;
"
but
I
be
not
go
to
be
shoot
;
I
be
not
such
a
dunce
as
that
;
I
mean
to
take
one
glance
over
the
log
,
and
will
draw
back
so
quickly
that
no
one
will
get
a
chance
to
shoot
me
.
<EOS>
”otto
<EOS>
protest
,
but
,
see
it
be
useless
,
give
over
and
make
the
sensible
suggestion
that
,
instead
of
climb
up
the
wall
and
thereby
probably
make
know
what
he
be
do
,
he
should
stand
on
the
shoulder
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
that
would
give
him
enough
elevation
,
and
the
lad
added:“if
<EOS>

”At
<EOS>
the
very
moment
Jack
make
ready
to
avail
himself
of
his
friend
's
support
<EOS>
,
they
hear
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
,
the
meaning
of
which
be

<EOS>
a
number
of
them
seem
to
be
move
heavily
over
the
ground
,
as
though
carry
some
weighty
body
or
marching
in
military
step
.
<EOS>
the
boy
listen
closely
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
tell
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
the
noise
add
to
Jack
's
curiosity
,
and
,
lean
his
gun
against
the
log
,
he
said”“help
me
up
<EOS>
,
Otto
;
I
be
bind
to
find
out
what
all
that
be
about

<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
be
an
easy
matter
to
mount
the
shoulder
of
his
young
friend
,
whose
strength
would
have
support
double
his
weight
.
<EOS>
Jack
find
,
as
he
anticipate
,
that
he
would
be
able
to
look
over
the
log
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
steady
himself
by
place
his
hand
against
the
wall
,
he
slowly
raise
his
head
until
almost
on
a
level
with
the
top
,
when
he
quietly
look
over
.
<EOS>
no
movement
of
the
kind
be
expect
by
the
Indians
,
and
the
face
be
withdraw
before
any
one
of
them
could
fire
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
a
person
can
see
a
great
deal
in
an
exceedingly
brief
space
of
time

<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
learn
much
about
that
which
have
excite
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the

have
be
put
up
from
material
cut
in

a
number
of

entirely
off
at

several
of

most
of

<EOS>
It
look
as
if
the

while
at
work

or
they
have
voluntarily

alert
for
the
first
demonstration
from
the
red
man
,
distress
by
the
consciousness
that
their
cunning
enemy
be
sure
to
do
the
very
thing
which
be
least
expect
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
notice
that
whenever
he
stand
with
his
back
against
the
log
,
he
could
see
the
upper
portion
of
the
tree
which
grow
close
to
the
structure
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
him
that
some
of
the
daring
warrior
be
liable
to
turn
the
fact
to
account
.
<EOS>
It
would
take
no
great
skill
for
one
or
two
of
them
to
climb
into
the
limb
,
from
which
they
would
command
a
portion
of
the
interior
.
<EOS>
no
well
opportunity
could
be
ask
—
in
case
they
be
not
discover
by
the
lad
—
to
fire
down
upon
them
.
<EOS>
“I've
be
dinke
of

,
"
reply
Otto
,
when
the
matter
be
mention
;
"
and
I
dinks

and
py
gracious

startling
declaration
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
friend
be
stand
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
structure
,
so
that
they
look
in
the
direction
of
the
river
,
where
tower
a
bushy
oak
,
fully
twenty
foot
of
the
upper
portion
be
in
sight
.
<EOS>
something
be
among
the
branch
,
though
the
object
could
not
be
see
distinctly
.
<EOS>
fortunate
it
be
that
both
be
gaze
toward
the
point
when
their
suspicion
be
first
awaken
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
it
be
an
Indian
,
as
sure
as
I
live
!
"
<EOS>
add
Jack
,
in
an
excited
manner
.
<EOS>
"
rash
fool

<EOS>
He
have
seal
his
fate
,
for
I
could
not
want
a
fair
target

<EOS>
leave
him
to
me!”“All
right
<EOS>
;
I
leave
<EOS>
him!”The
young
Kentuckian
be
sure
of
his
man
,
even
though
he
be
only
partially
reveal
,
when
the
rifle
be
point
.
<EOS>
He
take
careful
aim
,
but
while
in
the
act
of
press
the
trigger
,
he
lower
the
weapon
,
with
the
whispered
exclamation
.
<EOS>
“Great
heaven
!
<EOS>
It
be

Shawanoe!”CHAPTER

<EOS>
among
the
tree
-
topsjack
Carleton
be
astounded
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
moment
he
be
absolutely
certain
that
the
young
Shawanoe
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
would
make
no
attempt
to
return
to
the
Kentucky
shore
until
night
.
<EOS>
yet
he
have
not
only
recrosse
,
but
be
actually
within
fifty
foot
of
the
enclosure
,
directly
among
his
fierce
enemy
,
who
be
assail
it
,
and
,
more
remarkable
than
all
,
he
have
climb
among
the
limb
of
a
tree
,
where
he
could
gain
a
view
of
the
interior
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
minute
or
so
during
which
the
Kentuckian
actually
doubt
his
own
sense
.
<EOS>
“He
must
be
an
enemy
who
closely
resemble
Deerfoot
,
"
be
his
thought
;
"
I
will
shoot
him
before
he
shoot
me
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
probability
of
such
be
the
case
be
increase
by
the
fact
that
the
Indian
have
a
rifle
instead
of
a
bow
and
arrow
,
and
there
be
some
daub
of
paint
on
his
face
;
but
,
for
all
that
,
the
warrior
be
Deerfoot
,
as
a
second
scrutiny
convince
Jack
and
Otto
beyond
all
question
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
ish
Deerhead
!
<EOS>
I
mean
Deerfoot
,
"
whisper
the
german
lad
;
"
dink
a
whirlwind
<EOS>
lifs
him
out
te
boat
and
drop
him
in
de
tree
;
what
do
not
he
vants?”the
<EOS>
young
Shawanoe
have
manage
to
reach
a
place
amid
the
foliage
,
where
,
if
he
could
be
see
at
all
by
those
below
,
the
view
be
indistinct
,
while
,
by
push
the
branch
carefully
aside
in
front
of
his
face
,
he
be
plainly
reveal
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
when
Jack
Carleton
raise
his
gun
and
sight
at
the
object
in
the
tree
,
the
latter
sweep
aside
the
curtain
in
front
and
make
a
signal
with
his
hand
,
which
declare
his
identity
.
<EOS>
even
though
the
paint
have
be
plentifully
use
by
him
,
his
regular
feature
be
recognize
when
he
smile
,
and
keep
his
hand
wave
in
front
of
him
as
though
brush
smoke
from
his
eye
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
it
be
Deerfoot
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
Jack
,
lower
his
weapon
,
and
stare
with
open
mouth
at
the
figure
;
"
but
thing
be
get
mixed
,
and
I
be
not
exactly
understand
what
it
be
all
about
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
situation
be
too
critical
on
every
hand
for
the
young
friend
to
give
way
to
the
wonderment
cause
by
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
It
speedily
become
clear
that
while
the
Shawanoe
dare
not
speak
,
he
be
try
very
hard
to
convey
some
message
to
his
friend
by
mean
of
pantomime
.
<EOS>
hold
the
gun
of
the
Miami
in
one
hand
,
he
keep
the
other
go
energetically
,
but
neither
Jack
nor
Otto
could
guess
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
“Speak
louder
!
"
call
Otto
,
forget
himself
;
"
vot
vasn't
<EOS>
dot
dot
<EOS>
you
do
not
say?”instantly
Deerfoot
draw
back
his
head
,
allow
the
bush
to
close
,
so
that
he
be
only
partly
reveal
.
<EOS>
“He
be
go
to
shoot
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Jack
.
<EOS>
such
,
it
be
evident
,
be
the
intention
of
their
friend
,
who
bring
his
rifle
to
a
level
,
the
black
barrel
plainly
visible
as
it
be
thrust
among
the
branch
.
<EOS>
instead
of
be
aim
downwards
,
it
be
point
at
a
considerable
elevation
above
the
defender
at
some
object
at
the
other
side
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
turn
their
bead
,
the
boy
see
,
from
the
agitation
in
the
branch
of
a
tree
,
almost
large
as
the
oak
,
that
something
be
move
among
the
limb
.
<EOS>
the
truth
flash
upon
both
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
watch
their
friend
,
he
have
detect
an
enemy
steal
into
the
tree
behind
them
,
and
seek
to
make
know
the
alarming
truth
by
mean
of
gesture
.
<EOS>
see
they
fail
to
catch
his
meaning
,
he
decide
to
attend
to
the
matter
himself
,
though
it
can
be
understand
that
the
shot
would
render
his
own
death
almost
certain
.
<EOS>
“that
will
never
do
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
young
Kentuckian
;
"
deerfoot
be
too
valuable
to
be
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
savage
,
who
be
climb
,
do
so
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
now
a
beaded
moccasin
would
twinkle
alongside
the
trunk
,
whisk
out
of
sight
like
a
frolic
squirrel
;
then
a
red
feather
flash
to
sight
and
away
again
,
the
broad
,
paint
face
peep
from
behind
the
tree
,
while
glimpse
of
the
clothing
here
<EOS>
and
there
show
the
rate
with
which
the
warrior
go
upward
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
must
have
see
the
savage
at
the
moment
he
begin
ascend
the
trunk
,
and
could
not
fail
to
know
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
-
important
that
the
dangerous
individual
should
be
"
attend
to
,
"
and
,
observe
that
his
friend
be
too
much
absorb
in
watch
his
movement
to
remember
their
own
peril
,
the
friendly
Shawanoe
do
not
hesitate
to
take
the
frightful
risk
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
him
to
discharge
his
gun
from
the
elevation
without
the
other
warrior
discover
the
fact
,
though
one
or
two
may
suspect
the
weapon
be
fire
within
the
enclosure
;
yet
it
be
characteristic
of
the
youth
that
,
when
the
necessity
present
itself
,
he
do
not
hesitate
.
<EOS>
but
Jack
Carleton
's
presence
of
mind
come
to
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
begin
such
vigorous
gesture
that
the
attention
of
Deerfoot
be
catch
;
without
lower
his
gun
,
he
glance
downward
.
<EOS>
He
see
Jack
shake
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
swinge
his
hand
back
and
forth
and
dart
his
finger
excitedly
at
the
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
the
quick
-
witte
Shawanoe
catch
his
meaning
,
and
take
his
gun
from
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
again
he
push
the
bush
aside
,
so
that
his
face
come
to
view
,
and
,
look
down
on
his
friend
,
smile
,
nodded
,
and
make
several
gesture
toward
the
other
redskin
,
who
be
still
cautiously
climb
the
tree
.
<EOS>
then
the
curtain
be
draw
again
,
and
Deerfoot
assume
the
part
of
spectator
instead
of
actor
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
incredible
that
this
performance
could
have
take
place
without
detection
from
below
;
but
it
come
about
that
,
while
it
be
go
on
,
the
attention
of
the
red
man
be
occupy
by
another
occurrence
which
will
be
tell
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
the
only
one
who
show
any
interest
in
Deerfoot
and
his
enemy
,
steadily
make
his
way
aloft
,
be
the
boy
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
accept
the
lesson
,
Jack
tell
Otto
in
a
low
voice
to
keep
the
close
watch
on
all
the
tree
-
top
within
sight
,
for
it
seem
likely
that
still
more
of
their
enemy
would
resort
to
the
same
strategy
.
<EOS>
“let
there
be
no
mistake
about
this
,
"
he
say
to
his
companion
;
"
if
you
catch
sight
of
any
one
else
,
give
him
a
shot
,
but
I
be
to
settle
the
question
with
this
particular
gentleman
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
all
right
,
"
assent
Otto
;
<EOS>
"
dot
ish
,
it
will
be
all
right
if
he
be
not
all
wrong
when
you
hit
him
.
<EOS>
”Jack
<EOS>
Carleton
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
be
stand
with
his
left
foot
throw
slightly
forward
,
his
rifle
,
at
his
right
shoulder
,
his
head
incline
and
his
left
eye
,
close
.
<EOS>
He
be
follow
the
movement
of
the
Miami
(
as
he
judge
him
to
be
)
,
who
be
seek
a
perch
from
which
to
fire
down
on
the
defender
of
the
primitive
fort
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
for
our
friend
to
place
themselves
beyond
danger
from
that
particular
warrior
;
they
have
only
to
step
a
little
near
the
eastern
wall
,
when
it
would
intervene
between
them
and
the
savage
;
but
Jack
grasp
the
situation
well
enough
to
understand
the
advantage
of
impress
their
assailant
with
the
danger
of
any
kind
of
attack
.
<EOS>
if
the
defender
should
busy
themselves
with
dodge
the
aim
of
their
foe
,
the
tree
be
likely
to
swarm
with
them
,
and
it
would
become
impossible
to
elude
their
aim
.
<EOS>
as
before
,
the
climb
Miami
afford
occasional
glimpse
of
himself
.
<EOS>
now
a
moccasin
,
then
a
hand
,
his
gun
,
the
black
horse
-
hair
-
like
covering
for
his
crown
,
with
the
paint
eagle
feather
,
then
an
instant
gleam
of
the
eye
,
and
then
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
remember
that
a
wound
would
be
as
effective
its
death
itself
,
Jack
coolly
wait
the
opportune
moment
.
<EOS>
suddenly
he
see
the
rifle
,
arm
and
shoulder
of
the
warrior
,
as
he
fling
them
partly
over
a
limb
to
help
draw
himself
upward
.
<EOS>
without
a
second
's
delay
the
youth
fire
,
his
view
be
much
less
obstructed
than
be
the
care
with
his
friend
in
the
other
tree
.
<EOS>
an
ear
-
splitting
screech
break
the
stillness
,
and
the
wounded
Miami
come
tumble
downward
as
though
every
possible
support
have
give
way
beneath
him
.
<EOS>
to
the
watchful
lad
it
look
as
if
he
strike
nothing
at
all
in
his
descent
,
but
fall
with
the
swiftness
of
a
cannon
-
ball
,
until
the
intervening
log
shut
him
from
sight
.
<EOS>
“I
dink
some
ding
drop
,
"
say
Otto
,
with
a
grin
;
"
mebbe
he
do
not
try
to
fool
us
some
more
agin
,
do
not
it?”jack
<EOS>
make
no
comment
,
but
,
as
be
his
rule
,
reload
his
gun
with
utmost
haste
,
dread
all
the
time
a
rush
from
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
set
down
as
singular
that
something
of
the
kind
do
not
take
place
,
since
the
assailant
must
have
know
it
could
not
fail
to
be
effective
.
<EOS>
the
sagacious
Deerfoot
seem
to
believe
that
his
position
be
no
longer
tenable
,
for
,
instead
of
stay
where
he
be
,
he
begin
descend
,
apparently
in
panic
of
fear
,
lest
he
should
share
the
fate
of
the
other
red
man
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
he
could
,
he
keep
the
trunk
of
the
tree
between
him
and
the
youthful
marksman
until
beyond
all
danger
of
be
harm
.
<EOS>
Jack
see
just
enough
of
the
movement
to
understand
its
meaning
,
and
he
smile
grimly
.
<EOS>
“After
<EOS>
do
what
you
have
do
,
you
ought
to
take
the
part
of
leader
and
draw
off
the
warrior
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
young
Kentuckian
stand
near
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
glance
upward
in
different
direction
while
reload
his
piece
,
for
he
understand
too
well
the
necessity
of
unremitting
vigilance
whenever
the
american
Indian
take
a
hand
in
proceeding
.
<EOS>
Otto
be
not
behind
him
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
He
walk
softly
around
the
fort
close
to
the
wall
,
attentively
listen
for
sound
that
would
give
some
knowledge
of
what
be
go
on
outside
.
<EOS>
at
interval
he
stop
and
with
his
knife
gouge
the
wood
,
where
it
seem
thin
than
usual
,
but
in
every
case
find
the
thickness
too
great
to
be
pierce
.
<EOS>
just
beneath
the
spot
where
the
butt
of
the
tree
rest
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
wall
,
he
stop
once
more
and
press
his
ear
against
the
log
.
<EOS>
He
stand
fully
a
minute
,
when
,
without
move
his
head
,
he
look
sideways
at
his
friend
,
who
be
watch
him
.
<EOS>
the
expression
of
his
face
be
so
significant
that
Jack
know
he
have
make
a
discovery
of
importance
.
<EOS>
“What
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
Otto
motion
for
him
to
keep

forward

as

at

without

he
also
press
his
ear
against

with
a
view
of

<EOS>
every

know
that

good
conductor

,
though
in

there
be

of

through
which
the
noise
pass

the

scratching

certain
what
the

<EOS>
just
as
Jack
look
upward
he
see
,
to
his
amazement
,
the
head
and
front
of
the
huge
black
bear
come
up
the
inclined
tree
with
the
intent
purpose
of
enter
the
interior
.
<EOS>
It
instantly
occur
to
the
youth
that
it
be
the
same
daring
bruin
that
come
so
near
attack
them
a
short
while
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
use
this
place
as
his
den
and
mean
to
return
to
it
;
the
Indians
have
see
him
prowl
around
,
and
place
the
tree
so
as
to
temp
him
to
climb
upward
on
it
.
<EOS>
the
beast
advance
until
he
could
look
downward
on
the
couple
,
and
then
,
gaze
only
a
second
or
two
,
he
back
out
of
sight
and
drop
to
the
ground
with
a
strange
,
chuckle
growl
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
instant
a
feeling
of
unutterable
chagrin
come
over
the
lad
who
witness
the
maneuver
,
for
,
just
a
breath
too
late
,
he
comprehend
the
shrewd
trick
by
which
be
have
be
outwit
.
<EOS>
confuse
by
the
unexpected
sight
,
he
fail
to
note
that
the
creature
be
not
a
bear
at
all
,
but
a
Shawanoe
warrior
skillfully
disguise
as
much
.
<EOS>
with
the
skin
of
one
of
the
beast
gather
over
his
head
and
shoulder
,
he
have
make
his
way
up
the
support
,
peer
at
the
defender
,
and
then
withdraw
before
the
watchful
Jack
could
tumble
him
to
the
earth
with
the
bullet
that
would
have

his

<EOS>
a
messagejack
's
chagrin
be
deepen
the
more
he
reflect
upon
the
singular
occurrence
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
outwit
by
some
skillfully
-
execute
trick
of
the
Indians
,
he
would
have
accept
it
as
a
mishap
liable
to
overthrow
the
most
experienced
ranger
of
the
wood
;
but
he
feel
he
ought
to
have
know
on
the
instant
that
no
real
bear
would
have
attempt
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
phase
of
the
artifice
which
be
not
a
reproach
to
him
.
<EOS>
have
the
beast
use
the
enclosure
as
a
den
or
a
retreat
—
a
thing
of
itself
incredible
—
the
evidence
of
that
fact
would
have
be
notice
the
moment
the
boy
climb
within
.
<EOS>
then
the
likelihood
of
his
clambering
up
the
inclined
tree
in
the
presence
of
a
war
party
of
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
,
who
have
lay
it
for
that
very
purpose
,
be
too
grotesquely
absurd
to
be
think
of
with
patience
.
<EOS>
“Maybe
<EOS>
it
be
as
well
,
"
he
say
,
with
an
effort
to
extract
some
consolation
from
the
blunder
;
"
for
perhaps
it
will
lead
them
to
repeat
the
trick
.
<EOS>
”“Mine
<EOS>
gracious
!
<EOS>
why
do
not
he
drop
down
onto
mine
bead
?
"
<EOS>
say
Otto
,
step
hastily
away
from
his
position
;
"
he
would
have
mash
me
out
as
flat
as—-a
—
as
a
big
tree
itself
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
not
see
why
they
do
not
form
a
procession
of
bear
and
walk
right
over
among
us
?
<EOS>
We
would
have
stand
still
and
allow
them
to
hug
us
to
death
.
<EOS>
”admitte
<EOS>
the
only
explanation
that
present
itself
,
Jack
and
Otto
be
not
yet
able
fully
to
account
for
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
the
labor
of
drag
the
fall
trunk
and
lift
the
butt
to
the
wall
,
seem
too
great
to
suppose
it
be
to
be
use
only
to
allow
one
of
the
Indians
to
climb
to
the
top
and
peer
over
upon
the
boy
beneath
.
<EOS>
the
same
thing
could
be
accomplish
by
ascend
one
of
the
tree
and
avoid
the
peril
to
which
some
of
them
have
be
expose
.
<EOS>
but
,
beside
all
that
,
what
in
reality
be
gain
by
take
a
peep
at
the
youth
?
<EOS>
the
assailant
know
they
be
there
,
and
it
could
not
matter
a
jot
in
what
particular
manner
they
be
employ
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
could
do
nothing
that
could
give
those
on
the
outside
the
slight
concern
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
defender
whose
interest
require
the
anticipation
of
the
movement
of
the
warrior
.
<EOS>
“I
can
not
understand
it
,
"
say
Jack
,
stand
close
to
his
friend
and
talk
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
be
not
I
—
harks!”they
<EOS>
listen
a
full
minute
,
but
the
silence
could
not
have
be
more
profound
.
<EOS>
a
gentle
wind
stir
the
leave
overhead
,
and
the
top
of
the
tree
nearest
them
could
be
see
slightly
sway
against
the
clear
sky
beyond
.
<EOS>
the
murmur
of
the
great
forest
be
like
the
voice
of
silence
itself
while
the
almost
inaudible
murmur
of
the
Mississippi
,
sweep
so
near
,
make
itself
manifest
the
first
time
since
they
have
turn
at
bay
.
<EOS>
the
deep
quiet
be
more
impressive
than
the
whoop
and
screech
of
the
warrior
would
have
be
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
it
bode
mischief
,
and
the
utter
uncertainty
of
its
nature
almost
unsettle
the
remarkable
courage
both
up
to
that
moment
have
display
.
<EOS>
“I
hear
noding

"
add
Otto
;
<EOS>
"
i'mebbe
do
not
go
to

for

<EOS>
”“night
<EOS>
be
a
good
many

off

reply
Jack
,
with
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
sky
,
which
show
him
the
sun
have
not
yet
reach
meridian
;
"
they
can
beat
any
people
in
the

,
when
they
have
a
mind
to
do
so
,
but
there
be
be
no
necessity
of
halt
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
follow
up
over
the
log
it
would
have
be
all
end
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
”“Yaw
<EOS>
;
they
would
have
tumble
all
over
us
,
like
a
pig
lot
of

fall
down

but
now
I
dinks
they
wait

<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
will
they
do

that?”“If

<EOS>
”This
be
Otto
's
manner
of
express
what
be
inevitable
,
in
case
the
besieger
should
conclude
to
wait
for
the
hour
,
which
could
not
be
very
distant
,
when
the
defender
must
lose
all
power
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
the
two
do
not
forget
to
keep
a
continuous
guard
over
the
"
watch
-
tower
"
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
despite
the
repulse
that
have
follow
their
attempt
,
it
be
by
no
means
uncertain
that
they
would
not
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
the
success
of
the
bear
trick
be
likely
to
tempt
them
to
another
essay
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
Otto
Relstaub
be
lean
against
the
solid
log
,
his
position
such
that
the
sun
,
which
be
now
near
meridian
,
shine
directly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
His
friend
be
almost
immediately
opposite
—
the
two
look
in
each
other
's
face
,
and
exchange
word
in
low
tone
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
the
German
become
sensible
of
something
cool
just
behind
his
neck
.
<EOS>
“Vot
be
not
dot
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
put
up
his
hand
as
though
to
brush
away
some
insect

<EOS>
strike
nothing

he
turn
to
look
.
<EOS>
“O

oh

-
oh

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
a
wonder
expression
,
and
an
expansion
of
his
big
,
honest
eye
.
<EOS>
“There
be
an
opening
behind
you
,
"
remark
his
friend
,
move
hastily
across
to
where
he
stand
.
<EOS>
“Yaw

;
I

<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
certainly
be
curious
that
both
boy
should
have
make
such
a
minute
examination
of
the
interior
without
find
the
crevice
between
a
couple
of
the
log
,
large
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
several
bullet
,
and
through
which
it
would
have
be
an
easy
matter
for
their
enemy
to
shoot
him
who
stand
immediately
in
front

<EOS>
the
opening
be
some
six
inch
wide
,
and
no
more
than
an
eighth
of
an
inch
in
height
,
resemble
the
crevice
through
which
the
captain
look
out
upon
the
enemy
from
the
turret
of
a
monitor
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
the
red
man
have
make
no
use
of
it
be
proof
they
do
not
suspect
its
existence
,
though
that
do
not
lessen
the
wonder
of
Otto
that
he
have
fail
to
find
it
himself
,
when
make
search
.
<EOS>
“I
see
!
"
<EOS>
suddenly
exclaim
Jack
,
who
be
attentively
examine
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
no
wonder
you
miss
it
,
for
it
be
close
up

<EOS>
You
must
have
rub
one
of
your
long
ear
against
the
stick
which
fit
it
so
closely

<EOS>
”the
piece
with
which
it
have
be
close
lie
on
the
ground
,
at
the
foot
of
the
boy
,
and
make
clear
why
they
have
fail
to
find
that
for
which
they
have
hunt
so
carefully
.
<EOS>
Jack
cut
the
stick
apart
with
his
knife
and
reinserte
one
half
with
a
view
of
render
it
less
liable
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
besieger
.
<EOS>
then
,
quite
sure
that
it
be
still
unknown
to
them
,
he
lean
forward
with
his
eye
to
the
opening

“While

here

”His
<EOS>
friend
nod
,
to
signify
he
would
be

then
Jack
take
a
survey
of
his
surrounding

<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
he
stand
nearly
under
the
tree
which
lean
against
the
wall
,
and
thus
gain
a
good
view
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
see
enough
to
interest
the
most
indifferent
spectator
.
<EOS>
five
paint
indian
warrior
be
see
stand
around
what
seem
to
be
a
dancing
bear
,
who
be
gesticulate
with
his
fore
paw

<EOS>
suddenly
he
cast
off
the
shaggy
hide
and
reveal
the
redskin
who
bad
make
the
audacious
ascent
on
the
log
in
his
disguise
and
peep
over
on
the
boy
below
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
talk
with
his
friend
,
while
the
whole
half
dozen
be
gesticulate
with
great
energy
,
though
,
in
spite
of
their
excitement
,
their
word
be
speak
so
low
that
our
friend
could
hear
little
more
than
the
jumble
murmur
of
their
voice
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
more
Indians
be
close
at

,
but
Jack
see
none
.
<EOS>
He
stealthily
remove
the
other
part
of
the
stick
,
and
thereby
widen
his
view
considerably
,
but
he
still
fail
to
discover
anything
more
.
<EOS>
His
vision
take
in
the
tree
up
which
Deerfoot
have
climb
,
but
nothing
be
to
be
observe
of
him
,
or
of
any
other

around
the
base

<EOS>
convinced
that
they
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
fort
,
Jack
give
his
whole
attention
to
those
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
look
very
much
as
if
the
author
of
the
trick
describe
be
regale
his
friend
with
an
account
of
the
highly
successful
manner
in
which
he
have
play
his
point
on
the
unsuspecting
party
within
the
enclosure

<EOS>
Jack
be
convince
that
the
rifle

shoot
which
he
and
his
friend
hear
,
before
rush
into
the
refuge
,
be
the
one
that
slay
the
bear
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
have
hastily
skin
the
animal
,
probably
complete
the
task
near
the
time
they
become
aware
of
the
presence
or
rather
the
flight
of
the
two
boy

They

unite
in

manner

so
close

the
log
,
though
even
that
theory
fail
fully
to
satisfy
the
question
of
the
youth

<EOS>
another
interesting
discovery
be
that
he
have
see
two
of
the
Shawanoes
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
difficulty
in
recognize
them
as

show
such
eagerness

follow
the
trail
of
the
hunter

some
distance
back

vigorous

somewhat

abruptly
stop

<EOS>
the
entire
party
seem
to
have
become

“Now

will
hatch
up
some
more
mischief

thought

I
do
not

it
likely
they
will
send
that
bear
up
the
tree
again
.
<EOS>
if
they
do
he
will
come
down
a
little
quick
than
he
go
up

<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
sensation
of
the
young
Kentuckian
be
very
peculiar
,
when
he
become
aware
that
the
Shawanoe
who
have
display
so
much
skill
in
hunting
for
his
footprint
in
the
twilight
be
look
directly
toward

He
seem
in
fact
to
be
gaze
into

eye

him
out

glad
at
that
moment
have
the
opening
be
hermetically
seal
;
but
,
hopeful
that
he
be
not
see
,
he
hold
his
place
,
not
stir
in
the
slight
,
and
strive
to
the
utmost
to
keep
from
wink
his
eye

<EOS>
the
singular
tableau
last
much
less
time

the
boy
imagine

all
at

hum

conversation
be
renew

every
one
of
the
half
dozen
seeming
to

the
impulse

moment

He
who
have
be
gaze
so
steadily
at
Jack

in
the
face
of
one
of
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
instantly
the
boy
move
to
one
side
and
replace
the
rest
of
the
stick
,
so
that
the
crevice
be
close
once
more
.
<EOS>
“There

he
exclaim

with
a
sigh
,

more
try
situation

”“vot

his

his

sympathy

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
MANEUVRES
of
deerfootdeerfoot
the
Shawanoe
commit
a
serious
mistake
as
he
himself
be
the
first
to
discover
,
when
he
upset
the
Miami
warrior
into
the
Mississippi
and
make
off
with
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
He
have
start
out
to
help
his
friend
,
but
his
course
be
an
injury
to
them
,
for
it
increase
their
danger
without
give
them
the
least
assistance
.
<EOS>
what
he
ought
to
have
do
,
when
he
observe
the
drowsy
fisherman
,
be
to
bring
the
boy
to
the
spot
,
so
that
,
directly
after
the
red
man
be
dispossess
,
the
three
could
have
enter
the
boat
and
hasten
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
have
he
do
so
,
all
that
which
follow
would
have
be
avert
.
<EOS>
in
refer
to
the
course
of
the
young
Shawano
the
most
incredible
statement
be
that
the
blunder
be
altogether
due
to
his
waggishness
,
because
in
his
eagerness
to
play
a
joke
upon
an
enemy
,
he
forget
his
usual
caution
;
but
such
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
warrior
,
however
,
be
not
the
one
to
stay
on
the
western
shore
when
his
friend
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
tell
them
to
expect
him
back
at
a
certain
hour
,
early
in
the
afternoon
,
his
intention
be
to
return
much
earlier
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
folly
for
him
to
make
for
any
point
near
that
from
which
he
depart
when
he
set
out
from
the
Kentucky
shore
.
<EOS>
such
a
proceeding
would
be
see
by
his
enemy
,
and
would
invite
them
to
riddle
him
with
bullet
as
he
approach
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
touch
the
Louisiana
side
,
he
run
under
the
overhang
limb
far
enough
to
be
out
of
sight
of
any
who
may
be
on
the
watch
,
and
then
push
vigorously
up
stream
.
<EOS>
He
continue
until
he
have
go
fully
a
half
mile
and
have
round
quite
a
bend
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
then
he
paddle
straight
across
to
the
other
bank
,
down
which
he
make
his
way
with
the
same
haste
.
<EOS>
He
speedily
arrive
in
the
vicinity
of
the
lad
and
prepare
,
in
his
characteristic
fashion
,
to
take
a
hand
in
their
rescue
.
<EOS>
hope
that
the
chance
for
flight
would
speedily
come
,
he
carefully
draw
the
canoe
under
cover
,
where
he
be
confident
it
would
not
be
see
by
any
enemy
prowl
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
then
he
stealthily
plunge
into
the
wood
to
give
what
help
he
could
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
It
take
him
only
a
little
while
to
find
they
be
at
bay
within
the
log
enclosure
and
in
much
great
danger
than
he
first
suppose
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
cause
a
change
in
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
return
to
the
canoe
and
take
out
the
rifle
which
he
have
capture
;
his
bow
and
,
arrow
be
not
leave
within
the
boat
,
for
he
value
them
too
highly
to
incur
such
risk
;
they
be
hide
where
he
know
no
one
could
possibly
steal
them
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
then
the
little
phial
which
he
carry
in
the
receptacle
with
his
Bible
be
uncork
and
the
crimson
paint
apply
with
his
forefinger
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
ornamentation
be
as
fantastical
as
the
imagination
of
the
native
American
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
view
for
the
first
time
by
those
who
do
not
know
him
,
he
would
have
be
class
as
one
of
the
fierce
warrior
that
ever
go
on
the
war
trail
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
a
pagan
instead
of
a
Christian
,
the
idea
would
have
be
a
correct
one
.
<EOS>
but
Deerfoot
be
handicap
from
the
first
by
the
fact
that
he
be
know
to
more
than
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
at
that
day
there
be
scarcely
a
Shawanoe
east
of
the
Mississippi
who
have
not
hear
of
the
execrated
friend
of
the
white
man
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
his
favorite
weapon
,
beside
his
knife
and
tomahawk
,
be
his
bow
and
arrow
;
that
his
skill
with
them
approach
the
marvelous
;
they
know
that
his
fleetness
surpass
that
of
any
live
person
that
he
possess
a
form
and
feature
of
rare
beauty
;
that
his
courage
be
surpass
by
none
,
for
,
when
but
a
stripling
,
he
have
hand
a
knife
to
the
furious
Tecumseh
,
and
dare
him
to
fight
unto
the
death
,
and
that
his
cunning
and
subtlety
be
beyond
the
reach
of
the
ordinary
warrior
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
himself
be
aware
of
his
general
notoriety
,
and
,
though
he
may
not
have
be
see
by
the
Shawanoes
,
yet
they
would
identify
him
at
the
first
glance
,
provide
he
appear
before
them
in
his
own
proper
person
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understand
,
therefore
,
why
he
disguise
his
appearance
with
such
care
.
<EOS>
with
the
shrewdness
of
one
of
our
modern
detective
,
he
make
a
change
also
,
as
may
be
say
,
in
"
himself
"
that
is
,
he
walk
differently
,
and
use
his
arm
and
leg
in
style
altogether
foreign
to
his
custom
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that
there
be
several
strong
point
in
his
favor
;
his
be
the
tribe
whose
warrior
hate
him
with
unspeakable
hatred
,
and
he
therefore
be
a
master
of
every
detail
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
assist
by
the
gloom
of
night
,
he
be
in
scarcely
any
danger
,
though
it
be
far
different
under
the
glare
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
another
advantage
should
be
name
,
inasmuch
as
the
reader
be
apt
to
overlook
it
;
the
separate
war
party
from
the
Shawanoe
and
Miami
tribe
be
not
only
few
in
number
,
but
they
have
not
meet
until
after
arrive
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
youthful
pioneer
be
travel
with
little
fear
of
molestation
.
<EOS>
thus
,
in
a
certain
sense
,
the
warrior
,
while
ally
,
be
comparative
stranger
.
<EOS>
after
disguise
himself
he
believe
his
identity
would
not
be
discover
by
the
Miamis
,
unless
,
possibly
,
by
the
lone
fisherman
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
fair
prospect
that
he
could
avert
suspicion
for
a
time
on
the
part
of
the
Shawanoes
,
unless
particular
attention
be
direct
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
foregoing
seem
necessary
in
order
to
justify
what
be
do
by
the
wonderful
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
He
manage
to
appear
on
the
outer
fringe
of
the
ring
of
assailant
,
without
draw
special
notice
,
and
he
use
all
his
skill
in
learn
what
the
assailant
intend
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
warrior
who
have
be
shoot
while
in
the
act
of
climb
over
the
log
after
the
boy
,
meet
his
fate
before
Deerfoot
arrive
on
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
be
in
a
revengeful
mood
,
and
be
unanimous
in
their
determination
to
visit
the
bad
punishment
on
the
youth
who
be
make
such
a
brave
fight
for
their
life
.
<EOS>
“But
for
Deerfoot
they
would
not
be
in
this
sad
plight
,
"
be
the
thought
of
the
young
Shawanoe
;
"
therefore
the
Great
Spirit
expect
Deerfoot
not
to
think
of
his
own
life
until
they
be
save
from
the
death
which
threaten
them
.
<EOS>
”fortunately
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
the
warrior
be
scatter
to
a
considerable
extent
,
and
seem
to
give
their
whole
thought
to
those
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
know
,
when
he
observe
the
heavy
log
borne
forward
,
and
the
butt
place
on
the
wall
,
that
it
be
mean
to
be
use
to
carry
out
some
plan
not
clearly
settle
in
the
mind
of
the
assailant
themselves
.
<EOS>
when
he
see
a
move
to
climb
the
tree
which
stand
near
the
rude
fort
,
he
fear
his
friend
would
be
catch
unawares
,
and
he
take
to
a
tree
with
the
hope
of
be
able
to
give
them
warn
in
time
.
<EOS>
on
this
point
it
will
be
see
the
young
warrior
underrate
the
woodcraft
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
he
glance
at
the
rifle
of
Jack
Carleton
<EOS>
point
at
him
,
before
he
have
seek
to
open
communication
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
natural
precaution
which
lead
him
to
select
a
tree
where
he
be
able
to
use
the
sign
language
,
without
be
see
by
any
of
his
enemy
below
.
<EOS>
He
make
sure
that
enough
foliage
intervene
to
screen
him
from
the
inquire
gaze
of
his
enemy
during
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
have
make
certain
that
his
identity
be
know
to
his
friend
,
it
will
be
remember
that
the
sought
to
warn
them
of
the
very
peril
which
threaten
from
the
tree
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
fail
to
make
himself
clear
,
he
raise
his
own
gun
with
the
intention
of
shoot
the
savage
from
the
perch
,
but
providentially
Otto
Relstaub
avert
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
believe
that
have
Deerfoot
fire
the
shot
he
could
have
effect
his
own
escape
.
<EOS>
the
point
from
which
the
gun
be
discharge
must
have
make
itself
manifest
to
more
than
one
warrior
below
,
and
would
have
involve
him
in
a
labyrinth
of
peril
,
where
his
subtlety
must
have
fail
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
nee
not
be
repeat
that
he
would
not
have
falter
on
that
account
,
have
the
need
exist
.
<EOS>
He
believe
it
his
duty
to
hesitate
at
no
risk
,
because
he
himself
be
wholly
to
blame
for
the
dire
strait
in
which
the
boy
find
themselves
.
<EOS>
with
a
grim
enjoyment
that
can
hardly
be
understand
,
Deerfoot
stand
in
the
background
and
watch
the
antic
of
the
warrior
who
have
wrap
the
bear
-
skin
about
his
shoulder
and
body
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
avoid
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
the
cleverness
with
which
the
front
be
arrange
,
so
as
to
resemble
that
of
the
beast
,
but
he
feel
not
the
slight
fear
that
the
trick
would
succeed
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
an
antiquated
stratagem
that
he
wonder
it
be
attempt
,
especially
after
the
defender
have
give
so
convincing
evidence
of
their
watchfulness
.
<EOS>
His
amazement
,
therefore
,
may
be
appreciate
when
he
see
the
creature
slowly
make
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
fort
,
look
down
on
the
boy
,
and
then
back
a
few
step
and
drop
to
ground
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
believe
they
have
fail
penetrate
a
disguise
which
could
scarcely
hope
to
deceive
,
except
under
very
favor
circumstance
but
conclude
they
must
have
refrain
good
reason
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
while
these
troublesome
thought
be
in
the
mind
of
Deerfoot
,
he
keep
his
eye
on
the
Miami
,
whose
scant
clothing
have
not
dry
after
his
voluntary
plunge
into
the
Mississippi
,
from
the
bow
of
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
His
victim
act
as
though
he
entertain
some
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
the
individual
that
do
not
mingle
with
the
main
body
of
the
warrior
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
know
that
if
he
do
suspect
the
truth
,
his
curiosity
be
likely
to
cause
trouble
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
come
when
it
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
Miami
walk
toward
the
enclosure
,
where
two
of
his
own
tribe
be
talk
same
number
of
the
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
He
say
something
which
stir
up
matter
at
once
.
<EOS>
all
five
begin
talk
vigorously
,
and
then
they
turn
take
a
look
at
the
youthful
warrior
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
,
have
vanish
as
silently
as
he
appear
on
the
scene
,
and
it
be
well
that
he
do
so
,
for
the
deception
could
have
be
carry
no
further
.
<EOS>
within
the
succeed
ten
minute
the
report
of
a
rifle
come
from
the
direction
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
then
a
second
be
hear
from
another
point
in
the
wood
,
and
again
a
third
report
awake
the
echo
among
the
tree
.
<EOS>
the
red
man
do
not
know
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
all
the
survive
member
of
the
two
party
be
together
,
and
they
could
not
understand
who
the
new
comer
be
.
<EOS>
They
be
probably
those
of
their
own
race
,
though
the
discomforte
possibility
remain
that
they
may
be
white
man
on
their
way
to
the
help
of
the
beleaguered
boy
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
Deerfoot
be
convince
that
if
Jack
and
Otto
be
not
extricate
from
their
peril
long
before
night
,
no
hope
could
remain
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
clearly
in
the
power
of
the
red
man
to
capture
or
destroy
them
whenever
they
choose
to
put
forth
the
effort
,
that
he
know
they
would
not
wait
until
night
.
<EOS>
there
be
tree
on
every
hand
which
would
shelter
the
sharp
-
shooter
.
<EOS>
if
they
ensconce
themselves
among
the
limb
of
these
,
the
lad
would
be
shut
off
from
the
chance
of
protect
themselves
,
for
on
whichsoever
side
of
the
space
they
stand
,
they
would
be
within
the
range
of
one
or
two
of
the
gunner
.
<EOS>
the
plan
which
he
next
proceed
to
put
into
execution
be
in
the
mind
of
Deerfoot
from
the
first
moment
be
learn
of
the
situation
of
the
endanger
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
succeed
without
a
perfect
understanding
with
his
friend
,
for
they
necessarily
have
an
important
part
to
play
in
the
programme
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
will
send
them
a
message
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
with
a
throb
of
pride
over
the
facility
at
his
command
;
"
that
will
tell
everything
.
”make
<EOS>
his
way
to
a
safe
point
in
the
forest
,
he
sit
down
on
the
ground
,
tear
off
a
piece
from
the
paper
which
he
carry
with
his
Bible
,
and
with
red
chalk
,
sharpen
to
a
point
,
he
proceed
to
write
the
word

<EOS>
the
paper
be

around

just

bead

and
he
then
be
ready
to

the
slight
space
that
separate
him
from
the
arrow
,
quiver
in
the
log
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
He

of
the
young
Shawanoe

extraordinary
skill

such
an
elevation
that

<EOS>
“It

message
from
Deerfoot

"
repeat
the
Kentuckian
,
as
he

out
the
missile
and
unwrap
the
paper
wound
around
it
.
<EOS>
"

see
what
he

to
say
.
<EOS>
”The
paper

,
show
the
follow
word
in
the
small
but
graceful
hand
of
the
shawanoe:“let

They

and

<EOS>
let
them
listen
closer
,
for
they
be
mean
for
their
ear
!
<EOS>
then
will
come
shout
and
the
sound
of
a
gun
the
fourth
time
!
<EOS>
let
my
brother
climb
over
the
log
and
run
as
fast
as
they
can
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
close
by
the
ash
that
lie
with
its
limb
in
the
water
,
they
will
find
the
canoe
;
they
must
make
haste
to
paddle
across
or
it
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
wait
for
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
He
will
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
let
my
brother
listen
and
be
not
slow
.
<EOS>
”“there
be
no
trouble
to
understand
what
he
mean
,
"
say
Jack
,
after
read
the
word
aloud
.
<EOS>
“what
<EOS>
ish
<EOS>
it
dot
he
do
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Otto
,
not
quite
certain
as
to
the
purpose
of
their
dusky
ally
.
<EOS>
“He
mean
to
start
a
panic
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
try
to
scare
the
red
man
so
that
they
will
scatter
and
give
us
a
chance
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
german
lad
shake
his
bead
.
<EOS>
“Nix
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
do
dot
.
”“It
<EOS>
look
to
me
like
a
wild
scheme
,
but
as
it
be
the
last
hope
,
we
must
be
ready
to
give
all
the
help
we
can
,
<EOS>
for
I
do
not
know
of
any
one
who
ought
to
be
more
interested
than
we
.
<EOS>
Sh
!
<EOS>
what
be
that?”Just
then
it
be
so
still
that
the
slight
noise
make
by
a
fall
fragment
of
a
stick
reach
their
ear
.
<EOS>
look
quickly
around
they
see
that
the
bit
of
wood
which
have
be
use
to
close
the
orifice
between
the
log
have
fall
or
have
be
push
out
and
lie
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
narrow
slit
would
have
show
daylight
through
it
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
close
by
altogether
a
different
object
or
rather
series
of
object
;
for
when
the
astonished
boy
contemplate
the
spot
they
catch
the
gleam
of
two
pair
of
eye
peer
at
them
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
have
find
the
opening
and
be
scrutinize
the
interior
.
<EOS>
the
glitter
of
the
four
orb
which
fill
the
crevice
cause
most
peculiar
sensation
on
the
part
of
the
boy
who
see
them
.
<EOS>
“Ain't
<EOS>
you
not
ashamed
mit
yourselves
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Otto
,
quickly
bring
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
firing
directly
through
the
opening
.
<EOS>
“I
teach
you
mit
well
manner
.
<EOS>
”But
,
quick
as
he
be
,
the
warrior
be
quick
,
and
the
darken
slit
become
light
with
the
noiseless
speed
of
a
twinkle
sunbeam
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
need
no
second
intimation
of
what
be
come
.
<EOS>
the
crisis
which
follow
this
shot
be
more
imminent
than
the
defender
suppose
.
<EOS>
the
assailant
have
become
convinced
that
they
be
throw
away
valuable
time
,
and
they
assemble
in
a
group
to
consider
the
good
mean
of
force
matter
to
an
issue
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
that
moment
that
the
report
of
the
gun
be
hear
from
the
direction
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Shawanoe
and
Miami
suspend
conversation
and
,
look
inquiringly
at
each
other
,
listen
.
<EOS>
a
brief
while
after
,
the
second
shot
be
hear
from
another
point
,
follow
by
a
third
from
still
another
direction
.
<EOS>
“There
be
stranger
in
the
wood
,
"
remark
one
of
the
warrior
,
in
a
guard
voice
.
<EOS>
“our
<EOS>
brother
have
come
to
look
for
us
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
suddenly
as
the
crash
of
a
thunderbolt
,
the
Shawanoe
war
-
whoop
break
on
the
air
,
follow
by
what
seem
to
be
the
shout
of
white
man
.
<EOS>
then
a
voice
of
mortal
terror
shout
in
the
same
tongue:“the
white
man
be
come
!
<EOS>
the
white
man
be
<EOS>
coming!”the
sound
of
hurry
foot
be
hear
,
as
though
a
dozen
warrior
be
flee
in
hot
haste
from
a
dreaded
foe
.
<EOS>
the
effect
intend
by
this
diversion
of
Deerfoot
promise
the
brilliant
success
he
hope
rather
than
expect
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
savage
stand
close
to
the
fall
tree
,
start
with
an
exclamation
and
dash
off
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
point
whence
come
the
alarming
sound
.
<EOS>
the
effect
be
contagious
:
the
other
follow
pell
-
mell
,
every
one
plunge
forward
with
the
frantic
desperation
which
the
brave
man
will
show
in
moment
of
panic
.
<EOS>
It
nee
not
be
say
that
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
listen
to
these
favorable
sound
with
breathless
interest
.
<EOS>
They
understand
the
stratagem
of
Deerfoot
,
and
could
not
feel
very
hopeful
of
its
success
;
but
the
noise
of
hastily
depart
warrior
thrill
them
with
delight
.
<EOS>
“they
be
run
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
young
Kentuckian
,
with
beam
face
;
"
who
would
have
think
it?”“I
dink
it
time
<EOS>
dot
<EOS>
we
vasn't
<EOS>
do
the
same
,
"
say
Otto
,
who
,
catch
the
top
of
the
wall
with
both
hand
,
draw
himself
upward
and
peer
over
.
<EOS>
He
be
gratify
with
the
sight
of
the
two
hindmost
warrior
just
vanish
from
sight
.
<EOS>
the
whole
party
be
panic
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
Otto
turn
his
head
to
tell
the
joyful
news
to
his
companion
,
when
he
see
that
he
have
also
draw
himself
up
beside
him
.
<EOS>
the
fourth
report
of
a
gun
be
hear
.
<EOS>
“Now
be
your
time
,
"
say
Jack
:
"
over
with
you
;
I
will
hand
you
your
gun
.
<EOS>
”otto
<EOS>
lose
no
time
in
scramble
over
,
and
his
foot
scarcely
touch
the
ground
when
his
rifle
whiz
end
over
end
after
him
.
<EOS>
It
require
all
his
activity
to
dodge
it
,
and
,
while
do
so
,
he
receive
a
sound
thump
from
the
gun
of
his
friend
,
who
seem
to
be
fling
weapon
around
with
wild
recklessness
.
<EOS>
one
important
fact
be
clear
to
the
boy
:
the
panic
of
the
Indians
be
certain
to
be
short
-
lived
.
<EOS>
before
flee
far
,
they
would
suspect
the
trick
play
on
them
,
and
would
return
with
tenfold
more
fierceness
than
before
.
<EOS>
the
heart
of
the
boy
throb
high
with
hope
when
they
find
themselves
outside
the
enclosure
which
have
serve
them
as
a
prison
,
and
they
know
the
irrevocable
step
have
be
take
;
they
must
now
go
forward
at
all
hazard
.
<EOS>
the
Mississippi
be
near
,
and
thither
they
make
all
haste
,
remember
the
instruction
of
Deerfoot
as
convey
through
the
note
<EOS>
borne
to
them
on
the
wing
of
the
arrow
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
be
the
fleeter
of
foot
,
keep
slightly
in
advance
,
though
he
have
no
purpose
of
leave
his
friend
behind
.
<EOS>
“Dot
ish
one
good
thing
as
nefer
vos
,
"
Otto
take
occasion
to
say
,
while
pant
close
behind
him
:
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
oh
mine
gracious!”a
be
too
often
the
case
,
<EOS>
the
lad
rejoice
too
soon
,
for
the
word
be
yet
in
his
mouth
when
the
very
mishap
he
refer
to
overtook
him
.
<EOS>
a
run
vine
become
entangle
around
his
ankle
,
and
he
go
forward
on
his
hand
and
knee
;
but
he
be
not
injure
,
and
speedily
rise
again
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
their
imminent
peril
,
the
young
Kentuckian
could
not
repress
a
smile
when
he
glance
back
and
see
Otto
pick
himself
up
;
but
the
smile
be
go
instantly
,
for
the
situation
<EOS>
be
anything
but
a
mirthful
one
.
<EOS>
“here
we
be
!
"
<EOS>
call
out
Jack
,
halt
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
glance
around
him
.
<EOS>
"
but
where
be
the
canoe?”“I
dink
the
first
thing
ish
to
find
the
ash
tree
what
ish
not
lay
up
but
stand
down
,
"
suggest
Otto
,
move
along
the
stream
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
that
the
boat
could
not
be
find
until
after
locate
the
landmark
name
by
the
young
Shawanoe
;
for
it
be
certain
Deerfoot
have
take
care
to
hide
the
canoe
where
some
search
would
be
necessary
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
but
in
specify
the
fall
tree
,
Deerfoot
give
no
idea
of
where
it
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
believe
it
be
so
conspicuous
that
no
direction
be
require
.
<EOS>
during
the
few
second
that
the
friend
stand
irresolute
,
they
use
ear
as
well
as
eye
.
<EOS>
suddenly
the
whoop
of
an
Indian
be
hear
a
brief
distance
away
.
<EOS>
“My
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
Jack
;
"
they
be
come
back
!
<EOS>
They
have
discover
the
trick
.
<EOS>
”“Dot
<EOS>
ish
<EOS>
so
;
let
's
jump
on
to
de
water
and
swim
to
de
oder
side

<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
situation
be
enough
to
make
the
brave
nervous
,
and
the
sturdy
German
could
not
repress
his
impatience
.
<EOS>
every
second
be
of
incalculable
worth
,
and
yet
,
know
they
be
close
to
the
mean
which
be
to
take
them
to
safety
,
they
could
not
seize
it
.
<EOS>
“No
;
that
will
not
do
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Jack
,
resolutely
;
they
will
stand
on
the
bank
and
pick
us
off
without
trouble
to
themselves
;
we
must
find
the
boat
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
how
can
not

move
up
the

I
will

the
instant
you
catch
sight

I
will
do
the

it
before

”otto
<EOS>
spring
away
with
a
more
anxious
expression
on
his
broad
,
honest
face
than
it
wear
when
he
be
crouch
behind
the
log
,
and
the
young
Kentuckian
be
scarcely
less
agitated
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
be
similar
to
those
which
come
to
us
in
sleep
,
when
we
see
some
grisly
terror
approach
and
have
no
power
to
flee
before
it
.
<EOS>
somewhere
,
almost
within
reach
,
be
the
vehicle
to
carry
them
out
of
peril

yet
they
could
not
lay
their
hand
on
it

<EOS>
Jack
be
resolve
,
in
case
the
canoe
be
not
speedily
find
,
to
do
as
Otto
advise
—
leap
into
the
Mississippi
and
swim
boldly
for
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
if
they
could
gain
a
fair
start
,
they
would
have
cause
to
hope
;
but
such
an
attempt
,
desperate
as
it
be
,
must
be
undertake
very
soon
or
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
again
the
dread
whoop
reach
them
from
the
wood
,
and
the
leader
start
as
though
he
have
catch
the
click
of
a
gun
-
lock
from
behind
a
tree
.
<EOS>
the
cry
be
not
a
loud
one
,
and
be
no
doubt
mean
as
a
signal
to
some
one
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
where
Deerfoot
can
be
,
"
mutter
Jack
,
push
his
way
hurriedly
through
the
underbrush
,
and
glance
in
every
direction
for
the
fall
tree
which
be
to
show
them
the
craft
.
<EOS>
"
He
tell
us
not
to
wait
for
him
,
but
it
seem
to
me
he
ought
to
have
give
us
help
in
find
the
boat
.
<EOS>
”again
,
and
for
the
third
time
,
the
frightful
signal
tremble
among
the
tree
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
shall
not
catch
me
unprepared
,
at
any
rate
,
"
mutter
the
young
Kentuckian
,
raise
the
hammer
of
his
gun
and
look
defiantly
toward
the
point
whence
come
the
cry
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
do
not
show
himself
,
and
conscious
that
he
be
throw
away
precious
second
,
Jack
push
forward
once
more
,
keep
watch
of
his
flank
as
well
as
his
front
,
for
a
treacherous
shot
from
the
forest
would
render
a
canoe
altogether
useless
,
so
far
,
at
least
,
as
Master
Jack
Carleton
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
be
impatient
and
desperate
.
<EOS>
there
be
often
a
perverseness
in
inanimate
thing
which
be
beyond
endurance
.
<EOS>
He
have
start
with
the
high
hope
a
few
minute
before
,
confident
of
find
the
indian
canoe
without
trouble
,
and
now
he
be
baffle
and
hold
back
when
on
the
very
threshold
of
safety
.
<EOS>
“it
be
useless
to
wait
,
"
he
finally
say
,
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
call
to
Otto
and
we
will
swim
for
it
.
<EOS>
”But
,
before
he
could
emit
the
whistle
that
have
be
agree
upon
,
his
ear
be
set
tingle
by
the
identical
signal
come
from
a
point
up
the
bank
.
<EOS>
“Thank
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
be
his
exclamation
,
as
he
wheel
about
and
,
forgetful
of
the
other
signal
that
have
tell
him
of
peril
,
dash
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
with
furious
haste
.
<EOS>
“Otto
have
be
more
fortunate
than
I
,
"
he
add
,
as
he
bound
forward
;
"
he
have
find
the
canoe
,
and
I
pray
that
he
have
not
be
too
late
for
us
to
use
it
.

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVI
.
<EOS>
on
the
riverthe
experience
of
Otto
be
somewhat
similar
to
that
which
befall
Jack
Carleton
in
his
search
for
the
indian
canoe

<EOS>
strong
,
self

possess
,
and
courageous
by
nature
as
be
the
german
lad
,
he
fret
over
his
force
restraint
more
than
do
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
push
forward
with
grim
recklessness
.
<EOS>
He
catch
the
signal
of
the
warrior
which
cause
Jack
so
much
disquiet
,
but
he
do
not
permit
it
to
interfere
with
his
purpose

<EOS>
“let

of

his

<EOS>
He
be
on
the
point
of
signal
to
his
friend
to
return
,
and
,
insist
that
they
should
swim
the
river

,
when
he

aware
that

partially
screen
some

<EOS>
with
the
exclamation

the

<EOS>
Otto
throw
back
his

,
overcome
by
the
reaction
from
the
tense
strain

”But
<EOS>
he

shiver
at
the

the

that

,
without

soliloquy

place
his

in

the
whistle

Jack

spot

<EOS>
satisfied
that
no
repetition
of
the
call

require
,
Otto
give
his
attention
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
indian
canoe
,
buoyant
enough
to
carry
six

eight
warrior
,
and
furnish
with
three
long
paddle
which
,
in
skillful
hand

could
drive
it

similar
,
curve
inward
toward

middle
of

,
and
paint
with
rude
design
outside
,
which
show
more
taste
than

aboriginal
countenance

<EOS>
Deerfoot
have
display
no
little
ingenuity
in
screen
the
craft
from

<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
Otto
have
forget
himself
so
far
as
to
sit
down
on
the
very
tree
for
which
he
be
search
without

it
be

<EOS>
grasp
one

it
into

<EOS>
It

at
the
strength

have

overlook
the
fact

<EOS>
after

he

it
clear

He
whisk

Deerfoot
have
his

on

He

there
be
four
red

stand
together
on

edge

the
occupant

to
sink
sufficiently

inch
of
Deerfoot

figure

slightly
high

either
of

echo
of
the
gun

ring
through
the
wood

when
the
Shawanoe
straighten
up
and
dip
the
paddle
into
the
water
again

he
have
time
for
only
one
sweep
stroke

down
he

barely
in

shot

<EOS>
before

he

over

the
bullet

directly
under

“Deerfoot

<EOS>
ask
Jack

"
it
seem
to
me
they
would
not

quite
so
ready
with
their
gun

”The
<EOS>
Shawanoe
be
evidently
of

mind

He
have
the
choice
of
two
weapon

and
need
it
be
say
which
be
the
one
selected?stande
erect
in

he
fit
an
arrow
to
the
string
with
incredible
dexterity
and
launch
it
with
a
speed
that
render
it
almost
invisible

<EOS>
the
distance

him
to
elevate
the
missile
slightly

aim
of
Simon
Kenton

Daniel
Boone

with
his
long
,
trusty
rifle

remain
erect

shaft

land
,
when
he
give
utterance
to
a
defiant
shout
;
sit
down
,
and
deliberately
take
up
the
paddle
again
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
bear
in
mind
that
the
yellow
current
of
the
Mississippi
be
swell
by
freshet
near
its
headwater

and
the

dance
about

downward

the

<EOS>
It
be
within

to
say
that
there
be
not
one
who
do
not
understand
the
stratagem
by
which
the
young
Shawanoe
have
outwit
them
,

there

within
their
reach

themselves
upon

<EOS>
within
a
brief
space
of
time
the
gun
of
the
warrior
begin
pop
from
so
many
different
point
that
Deerfoot
dare
not
attempt
to
use
the
paddle

<EOS>
the
blue
puff
of
smoke
be
so
near
that
it
would
have
be
fatal
to
expose
himself
to
the
aim

,
unless
the
canoe
could
be
propel
still
further
from
them

it
be

to
be

the
converging
fire

Jack

most
uncomfortably
high

we
must
do
something

what
can

do?”Deerfoot
make
no

extricate

from
more
critical
situation
than
the
one
in

throw
himself
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
into
the
river
,
hold
fast
to
the

he
swam
toward

while
it
seem
absolutely
necessary
that
something
of
the
kind
should
be
do
,
yet
the
reader
will
perceive
that
the
course
of
the
Shawanoe
be
extremely
perilous
,
not
only
for
himself
,
but
for
his
friend
whom
he
be
so
anxious
to
benefit
.
<EOS>
His
removal
from
the
canoe
cause
it
to
ride
high
,
and
thereby
expose
them
to
the
bullet
that
be
continually
skip
about
it
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
himself
be
force
to
keep
his
shoulder
at
such
an
elevation
that
he
be
liable
to
be
perforate
by
some
fly
missile
,
but
he
increase
the
distance
between
himself
and
enemy
with
great
speed
than
would
be
suppose

<EOS>
the
sagacious
German
have
gather
the
three
paddle
<EOS>
so
they
be
add
to
that
side
of
the
craft
which
serve
as
a
partial
shield
against
the
shot
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
the
implement
be
so
arrange
that
the
lad
feel
safe
against
harm
,
unless
the
boat
should
turn
half
way
round
before
he
could
accommodate
himself
to
the
change
condition
of

.
<EOS>
“it
<EOS>
be
a
good
idea
,
"
say
Jack
,
admiringly
,
as
he
hasten
to
avail
himself
of
the
defense
;
"
I
do
not
believe
one
of
their
bullet
can
pierce
our
shield

<EOS>
”somethe
<EOS>
cold
make
itself
feel
through
the
clothing
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
where
his
hip
press
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
.
<EOS>
grope
with
his
hand
he
find
it
be
water
,
which
he
see
bubble
through
a
bullet
-
hole
that
be
force
below
the
surface
by
the
vigor
of
Deerfoot
's
arm
.
<EOS>
the
opposite
side
of
the
boat
be
lift
correspondingly
high
,
so
that
the
sunlight
shine
through
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understand
that
the
condition
prevent
the
Shawanoe
from
tow
the
boat
directly
across
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
the
swift
current
render
a
diagonal
course
necessary
,
and
even
that
could
not
be
push
with
enough
power
to
prevent
the
party
drift
down
stream
.
<EOS>
the
red
man
keep
up
a
desultory
fire
,
but
it
be
less
frequent
and
manifestly
less
hopeful
than
at
first
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
but
see
that
the
craft
be
steadily
pass
beyond
range
,
and
the
chance
of
inflicting
injury
grow
less
every
moment
.
<EOS>
soon
the
firing
cease
altogether
.
<EOS>
a
moment
later
,
the
dripping
form
of
Deerfoot
flip
over
the
gunwale
again
,
diffuse
moisture
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
without
a
word
,
he
seize
the
paddle
and
ply
it
with
his
old
-
time
skill
and
vigor
.
<EOS>
He
look
keenly
toward
Kentucky
,
but
see
nothing
of
his
enemy
:
they
must
have
conclude
to
withdraw
and
bestow
their
attention
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
but
,
convince
that
they
be
still
watch
the
course
of
the
canoe
,
he
again
rise
to
his
foot
,
and
,
circle
the
paddle
over
his
head
,
give
utterance
to
a
number
of
tantalizing
whoop
.
<EOS>
His
enemy
have
be
outwit
with
such
cleverness
that
the
youth
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
express
his
exultation
in
that
characteristic
fashion
.
<EOS>
when
Jack
Carleton
discover
the
water
bubble
through
the
bullet
-
hole
in
the
side
of
the
canoe
,
as
though
it
be
a
tiny
spring
that
have
just
burst
forth
,
he
be
afraid
it
would
sink
the
craft
.
<EOS>
He
insert
the
end
of
his
finger
to
check
,
in
some
measure
,
the
flow
;
but
Deerfoot
,
observe
the
act
,
shake
his
head
to
signify
it
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
“my
brother
shall
reach
land
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
“I
have
no
doubt
we
shall
,
since
you
be
use
the
paddle
again
,
but
a
little
while
ago
it
look
as

<EOS>
Deerfoot

"
add
Jack
,
with
a
smile

they
have
puncture
this

pretty
thoroughly

<EOS>
I
can
not

how
it

we

escape
when
the
bullet
seem
to
be
everywhere

<EOS>
”“the

the
Shawanoe

<EOS>
“No

the
sturdy
response
of
Jack
;

I
acknowledge
His

<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
do
I
,
that
if
yon
get
in

of
a
Shawanoe
or
Miami
rifle

you
will
be
hit
unless
yon
be
very
quick
to
get
out

but
for
all
that
,
"
the
Kentuckian
hasten
to
add
,
notice
a
reprove
expression
on
the
countenance
of
his
dusky
friend

"
my
heart
overflow
with
gratitude
because
we
have
be
save

when
there
seem
not
the
first
ray
of

for
us

<EOS>
the

come
near

none

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
dinks
different
,
"
be
the
unexpected
remark
of
Otto
,
who
,
assume
the
sit
position
,
take
off
his
cap
,
and
,
after
fumble
awhile
through
his
shock
of
yellow
hair
,
actually
find
a
ball
,
which
he
hold
up
between
his
finger
.
<EOS>
“Vot
<EOS>
do
not
you
dinks
ob
him
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
the
amazed
Jack
take
the
object
and
examine
it
.
<EOS>
no
need
be
there
of
do
so
;
it
be
a
rifle
ball
beyond
question
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
all
that
be
wonderful
do
that
get
into
your
hair
?
"
<EOS>
ask
his
friend
.
<EOS>
“I

spose

my

too
hard

<EOS>
canoe
be
so
close
to
shore
that
Deerfoot
stop
paddle
for
the
moment
and
extend
his
band
for
the
missile
.
<EOS>
He
simply
hold
it
up
,
glance
at
it
,
and
then
toss
it
back
to
Otto
with
the
remark:“The
head
of
my

thick
like
the
rock

but

”with
<EOS>
a
bewildered
expression
,
as
though
some
forget
fact
be
begin
to
dawn
upon
him
<EOS>
,
Otto
lay
his
cap
in
his
lap
and
begin
search
through
his
hair
with
both
hand
.
<EOS>
a
moment
later
,
his
face
beam
with
one
of
his
most
expansive
smile
,
and
he
show
two
more
rifle

bullet
that
have
be
fish
from
the
capillary
depth

<EOS>
“Yaw

do
not

anything
particularly
lucky
about

say
Jack
,
who
suspect
that
much
of
the
lad

stupidity
be
assume
.
<EOS>
a
healthy
youngster
never
fail
to
have
the
organ
of
mirth
well
forward
in
development
,
and
the
prompting
of
Otto
's
innate
love
of
fun
seem
to
have
little
regard
for
time
,
place
or
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
American
Indian
be
probably
the
most
melancholy
of
the
five
race
of
man
;
but
even
he
be
not
lack
in
the
element
of
mirth
which
it
be
maintain
be
often
display
by
dumb
animal
.
<EOS>
when
Deerfoot
hear
the
explanation
of
Otto
,
he
do
not
smile
,
but
with
a
grave
expression
of
countenance
give
his
entire
attention
to
the
paddle
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
German
sit
with
his
back
toward

the
other

the
Shawanoe
be
at

<EOS>
the
shore
be
only
a
few
rod
away
,
the
Mississippi
be
much
less
agitated
at
the
side
than
in
the
middle
.
<EOS>
without
any
display
of
effort
,
the
warrior
use
the
long
paddle
with
all
the
power
he
could
put
forth
.
<EOS>
very
soon
the
craft
attain
a
speed
great
than
either
of
the
pale
face
suspect

<EOS>
“No

repeat
Jack
Carleton
,
"
I
can
not
see
where
there

any
special
luck

I

You

”“my

“Now

Jack

<EOS>
Otto
rise
to
a
stoop

steady
himself
as
best
he
could
,
and
extend
his
hand
to
shake
that
of
the
Shawanoe
,
as
proof
that
he
indorse
his
remark

<EOS>
He
place
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
Kentuckian
to
steady
himself
,
for
he
know
that
it
be
a
difficult
matter
for
one
to
keep
his
balance
in
such
a
delicate
structure
as
an
indian
canoe

<EOS>
“Deerfoot

<EOS>

reach
that
point

his

when
the

arrive
in
Louisiana

<EOS>
It
strike
the

with
a
violence
that
start
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
at

he
catch
the
shoulder
of
Jack
Carleton

as
if
to
hold
him
quiet

but
it
be
all
pretense
on
his
part

<EOS>
there
be
no

to
his
finger

and
Jack
immediately
plunge
forward
,
his
head
bump
the
bottom
of

boat
with
a
crash

<EOS>
as
for
Otto

take
away

he
have
a
great
deal
more
of
fall
to
do
it
than
his

.
<EOS>
He
do
it
most
thoroughly
,
sit
down
with
such
emphasis
that
the
side
of
the
canoe
give
way
,
and
he
continue
the
act
on
dry
land
,
be
stop
by
a
small
sapling
in
his
path

<EOS>
Otto
whirl
over
on
his
face
,
and
scramble
to
his
foot
,
stare
around
to
learn
the
extent
of
the
calamity

<EOS>
He
gather
up
his
gun
and
hat
,
and
then
,
stoop
,
pass
his

over

attentively

“I

together

<EOS>
when
he

Otto

he
break
into
hearty
laughter

hasten
,
no

,
by
the
fact
that
Deerfoot
be
shake
from

mirth

<EOS>
His

eye
glisten
with

cause
by
his
amusement
over
the
performance
of
the
german

<EOS>
He
be
laugh
all
over
,
though
he
give
out
not
the
slight
sound
.
<EOS>
as
for
Jack
Carleton
,
he
chuckle
and
gurgle
with
a
noise
like
that
of
water
run
out
of
a
bottle
,
while
the
main
victim
of
all
this
merriment
be
as
solemn
as
an
owl

<EOS>
after
rub
and
adjust
himself
,
as
may
be
say
,
he
turn
slowly
about
and
gaze
inquiringly
at
his

in

as

puzzle

“Vot

”When

somewhat
recover
from

begin
laugh
with
scarcely

heartiness
than
they
show

<EOS>
the
absurd
occurrence
seem
slow
to
impress
itself
upon

<EOS>
Deerfoot
do
not

to
remain
idle
many
minute

<EOS>
the

he
lean
his

over

He
dislike

though
he
always

the
stuff
with
him

<EOS>
the

so
that
Deerfoot
hold
only
the
rifle
and
ammunition
in
the
way
of
a
reprisal

but
they
be
more
than
sufficient
to
replace
the
property
he
have
lose

he
have
no
cause
for
complaint

step
on

instead

he
see
only
the
lonely

stretch
north

he

They

become
discouraged
over
what

not

<EOS>
They
seem
to
have

steal
off
as
silently
as

Arabs

<EOS>
but
far
down

It

of
superfluous
luggage
,
and
it
could
not
be
say
that
his
companion
be
unduly
burden
,
since
the
runaway
colt
have
relieve
them
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
sling
his
long
bow
back
of
his
shoulder
,
as
he
be
accustomed
to
do
when
he
wish
the
unrestrained
use
of
both
arm
,
and
carry
the
rifle
as
the
other
do
theirs
.
<EOS>
the
belief
obtain
with
all
three
that
in
leave
Kentucky
they
bade
good
-
bye
to
most
of
the
personal
peril
to
which
they
bad
be
subject
.
<EOS>
the
reader
know
that
that
section
be
ravage
by
the
fierce
Shawanoes
,
Miamis
,
Hurons
and
other
tribe
who
be
implacable
in
their
hostility
to
the
white
man
,
and
who
do
so
much
to
give
it
the
name
of
the
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
by
which
it
be
so
long
know
.
<EOS>
there
be
thousand
of
red
man
range
through
the
immense
province
know
as
Louisiana
,
and
the
crack
of
the
hostile
rifle
,
the
war
-
cry
of
the
dusky
chieftain
,
and
the
shock
,
of
mortal
combat
mark
the
meeting
of
the
race
,
whether
on
the
clearing
,
in
the
forest
,
or
in
the
lonely
defile
in
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
in
that
section
to
which
I
have
refer
more
than
once
,
as
now
bear
the
name
of
Missouri
,
the
fighting
between
the
white
and
Indians
be
much
less
than
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understand
,
therefore
,
why
,
when
the
little
company
of
friend
stand
on
the
western
shore
,
they
feel
much
less
concern
than
while
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Less
than
two
day
'
tramp
to
the
westward
lay
the
young
settlement
where
dwelt
the
mother
of
Jack
Carleton
,
the
parent
of
Otto
Relstaub
and
a
dozen
other
family
who
have
emigrate
thither
from
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
far
beyond
and
to
the
southward
among
the
wildest
fastness
of
the
Ozark
mountain
the
young
Shawanoe
have
take
refuge
,
where
he
feel
secure
against
those
of
his
race
who
hate
him
with
irrestrainable
ferocity
.
<EOS>
as
it
would
require
no
great
digression
on
the
part
of
Deerfoot
,
and
as
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
time
be
very
valuable
to
him
,
<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
suppose
he
would
go
with
them
the
entire
distance
to
the
log
cabin
of
Jacob
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
to
their
surprise
,
however
,
he
quietly
say
be
could
keep
them
company
only
a
short
time
longer
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
have
no
doubt
you
would
be
with
us
to
the
end
,
"
say
the
disappointed
Jack
.
<EOS>
“it
would
make
the
heart
of
Deerfoot
glad
if
he
could
go
with
his
brother
whom
he
love
;
but
he
cannot
.
<EOS>
”“Vot

"
<EOS>
ask
Otto
,
unrestraine
by
the
sense
of
propriety
which
hold
the
tongue
of
Jack
silent
.
<EOS>
“Deerfoot
be
call
yonder
,
"
be
the
reply
,
point
south
of
the
path
which
lie
before
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
be
silent
a
minute
or
so
,
in
the
hope
that
,
he
would
explain
his
meaning
,
but
he
do
not
,
and
even
Otto
see
that
he
have
no
right
to
question
him
further
.
<EOS>
aware
that
his
friend
be
wait
for
him
to
add
something
,
Deerfoot
continued:“the
path
of
my
brother
be
straight
,
and
they
will
not
get
down
on
their
knee
to
look
for
the
trail
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
Shawanoes
among
the
tree
to
fire
when
they
be
not
look
,
and
Deerfoot
can
may
no
word
that
will
do
good
.
<EOS>
”“it
<EOS>
be
not
that
which
cause
us
to
hope
for
your
company
,
"
reply
Jack
,
who
be
stand
several
foot
away
from
the
youthful
warrior
and
look
in
his
serious
countenance
;
"
but
it
be
because
we
like
you
,
not
only
for
what
we
have
hear
from
other
,
but
for
what
we
have
see
with
our
own
eye
,
and
for
what
you
have
do
for
us
,
that
we
be
loath
to
part
with
you
.
”“deerfoot
<EOS>
will
go
part
of
the
way
,
"
the
Indian
hasten
to
say
,
perceive
the
feeling
of
his
friend
,
"
but
it
can
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
”“far
be
it
from
me
to
question
what
you
do
;
no
right
belong
to
me
,
but
I
could
not
let
you
go
without
tell
bow
much
we
appreciate
what
you
have
do
for
us
,
and
how
much
we
admire
your
noble
character
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
be
one
of
the
peculiarity
of
Deerfoot
that
he
never
accept
the
most
pointed
compliment
.
<EOS>
when
force
to
reply
to
a
direct
one
,
he
turn
it
aside
with
an
indifference
which
show
he
place
no
value
upon
it
.
<EOS>
as
Jack
Carleton
remark
later
on
,
praise
run
from
Deerfoot
like
water
from
a
duck
's
back
.
<EOS>
but
another
matter
force
itself
upon
the
attention
of
the
boy
,
who
be
on
their
way
to
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
state
already
that
the
father
of
Otto
Relstaub
be
penurious
,
miserly
,
and
cruel
.
<EOS>
the
colt
on
which
the
boy
have
ride
to
Coatesville
,
Kentucky
,
and
part
of
the
way
back
again
,
be
the
well
of
the
two
horse
own
by
him
.
<EOS>
Its
loss
be
certain
to
throw
him
into
a
great
rage
,
and
doubtless
would
bring
down
the
severe
punishment
on
the
back
and
shoulder
of
the
son
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
understand
this
prospect
as
well
as
do
Otto
himself
,
and
he
be
of
the
belief
that
a
resolute
effort
should
be
put
forth
to
recover
the
horse
.
<EOS>
when
the
matter
be
state
to
Deerfoot
,
his
own
knowledge
of
the
ill
-
temper
German
cause
him
to
urge
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
in
fact
he
would
have
do
so
,
have
the
case
be
otherwise
,
for
the
value
of
the
animal
<EOS>
be
considerable
.
<EOS>
furthermore
,
Deerfoot
be
of
the
opinion
that
the
colt
could
be
regain
without
serious
difficulty
,
and
he
tell
them
they
have
little
to
fear
from
hostile
Indians
.
<EOS>
have
the
Shawanoe
see
the
canoe
,
load
to
the
gunwale
with
red
man
in
their
war
paint
,
which
at
that
very
moment
be
steal
close
under
the
Louisiana
shore
,
be
would
have
modify
his
remark
to
a
very
considerable
extent
.
<EOS>
the
peculiarly
original
manner
in
which
the
boy
cross
the
Mississippi
have
result
in
carry
them
some
distance
below
the
trail
that
trend
to
the
westward
.
<EOS>
as
the
runaway
horse
have
undergo
the
same
experience
,
and
as
Otto
have
descry
him
when
he
emerge
from
the
river
,
it
be
easy
to
locate
quite
closely
the
point
where
he
enter
Louisiana
.
<EOS>
“it

<EOS>

<EOS>
“My

exclaim
Jack
,
"
can
not
you
handle

little

<EOS>
I
think
your

the
crooked

I

he
pause

half
turn
about

look
with
an
amused
expression
at
his

their
characteristic
conversation

<EOS>
there
be
something

in
the
fact
that
while
Otto

hear
the
english
tongue
speak
quite
correctly
,
from
the
hour
he
be
able
to
toddle
out

he
could
not

skill
to
Deerfoot

who
have
never

of
the
language
until
wound
and
take
prisoner

<EOS>
the
three
youth

down

bank
in
an
irregular
indian

for
no

Deerfoot
be

It

endless

there

his

a

when

take
back

ask
for

we
can
tell
him
that

it

the

It

<EOS>
”such
seem

he

along

there
the

<EOS>
It
be
unusually
murky

,
as
it
ascend
in

wavy

through

it
look
as
if
the
soiled

it
be
a
sight

it
excite
little

<EOS>
It
be
no

what
take
place
in
Kentucky

Jack

wood

patch

misty
mountain
many
mile
away

these
be
the
general
feature

the
immense
area
which
expand
before

<EOS>
ordinarily
there
be
nothing
among
these
of

the
eye

which
never

detect
almost
instantly
a

that
signify
a

<EOS>
in
a
depression

no

furlong
distant

could
be
observe
the
faint
possible
tinge
of
smoke
,
slowly
ascend
from
a
mass
of
dense
forest

<EOS>
It
be
so
faint

in
fact

that
neither

notice
it
,
until
Deerfoot
point
his
finger
in

direction

"
the

vapor
be
of

only
a

it
show

they
be

off

fire
not

cause
some
misgiving
about
the
personal

of
the
little

but
it
suggest
that
the

be
lose
beyond

<EOS>
horse

flesh
be
the
most

he
who
pilfer
it

more
danger

do
the

<EOS>
to
the

from
the
moment
our

leave
their

they
follow
a
different

of

“Mine

His

He

in

it
be
still
burn

else
the
smoke
would
not
have
catch
the
eye
of
the
indian
youth
;
but
it
must
have
be
smolder
for
hour
,
judge
from
the
thinness
of
the
vapor

and
the
fact
that
little
more
than

there

the

so
express

"
good
-
bye!”deerfoot
direct
his
course
toward
the
elevation
where
he
and
his
friend
stand
when
they
first
catch
sight
of
the
smoke
of
the
camp
-
fire
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
easy
matter
to
determine
,
whether
the
Osages
have
discover
the
horse
while
in
that
section
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
not
do
so
,
the
probability
be
against
their
find
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
an
interesting
question
have
already
be
answer
by
Deerfoot
,
respect
the
degree
of
hostility
of
the
Osage
Indians
.
<EOS>
there
be
comfort
in
the
thought
that
they
be
not
active
and
malignant
in
their
enmity
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
likely
to
trail
a
white
man
for
the
sake
of
take
his
life
,
as
their
fierce
brother
across
the
Mississippi
love
to
do
,
nor
do
they
possess
the
courage
of
the
warlike
Shawanoes
,
whose
encounter
with
the
early
pioneer
of
the
West
form
the
most
thrilling
episode
in
its
history
.
<EOS>
but
,
like
the
vagabond
red
man
of
to
-
day
,
the
Osages
be
of
that
character
that
a
white
man
would
much
prefer
not
to
meet
them
in
a
lonely
place
,
unless
help
be
present
or
within
call
.
<EOS>
if
they
should
come
across
the
two
boy
,
their
treatment
of
them
would
depend
very
much
on
the
mood
in
which
they
happen
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
incline
to
rob
them
of
everything
worth
take
,
and
may
end
the
matter
by
shoot
both
or
turn
them
adrift
without
gun
or
ammunition
.
<EOS>
have
Deerfoot
be
alone
,
he
would
have
give
them
no
thought
.
<EOS>
He
have
visit
their
village
more
than
once
,
and
though
the
question
of
several
of
their
warrior
show
that
they
regard
him
with
suspicion
,
they
offer
no
indignity
,
and
make
no
objection
to
his
departure
.
<EOS>
have
the
Osages
find
the
wandering
they
would
refuse
to
give
him
up
on
the
demand
of
the
owner
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
as
in
one
already
relate
,
he
could
be
regain
only
by
strategy
,
in
which
the
boy
be
sure
to
need
the
help
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
speculation
speedily
end
.
<EOS>
an
examination
reveal
the
fact
that
the
trail
of
the
steed
and
that
of
the
warrior
cross
,
but
the
latter

two
hour
old

from
the
point
of

they

thus
it
be
prove
that
the
colt
have
be
graze
for
a
considerable
time
close
to
the
Indians
without
them
suspect
it
.
<EOS>
the
Osages
have
continue
travel
in
a
southwesterly
direction
,
while
the
stray
horse
have
keep
on
in
a
course
slightly
to
the
north
of

<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
warrior
be
make
their
way
homeward
,
while
the
animal
seem
guide
by
an
instinct
that
promise
to
place
him
in
the
possession
of
his
owner
,
without
any
assistance
from

<EOS>
the
discovery
be
most
gratify
to

Deerfoot
express
his
pleasure
that
Otto
be
not
likely
to
suffer
at
the
hand
of
his
irate
parent
for
the
disaster
which
be
unavoidable
on

<EOS>
“good

say
he
;
"
he
may
not
meet
any
red
man
on
his

home

where
Deerfoot
hope
the
horse
will
greet
him
when

arrive

<EOS>
”“Did

you
see

side
the
Mississippi

"
<EOS>
ask
Jack
.
<EOS>
Otto
shake
his
head
,
as
he
be
sure
that
style
of
answer
could
not
be
criticize
by
either
of
his
companion

<EOS>
“the
outlook
be
a
good

Jack

heartily
;
"
and
what
you
have
do
,
Deerfoot

be
more
than

<EOS>
You
need
not

tell

it

”To
<EOS>
their
surprise
the
young
Shawanoe
extend
his
hand
to
Otto
.
<EOS>
“good
-

brother

<EOS>
”The
lad
shake
it
warmly

I

you
leave

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
second
farewell
be

to
Jack

fervently
press
the
soft

much

all
that
the
Shawanoe
say
as
he
release
his
hand
and
move
off
,
vanish
almost
instantly
among
the
tree

<EOS>
the
boy
stand
several
minute
,
silent
and
thoughtful
,
look
toward
the
point
where
the
Shawanoe
be
last
see
,
as
though
they
expect
him
to
return
;
but
the
silence
around
them
continue
as
profound
as
at
"
creation
's
morn

<EOS>
They
know
that
when
the
young
warrior
take
such
a
step
,
he
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
glad
to
keep
them
company
,
but
some
good
reason
take
him
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
shall
meet
him
again
,
"
say
Jack
Carleton
,
with
a
slight
sigh
of
regret
,
recall
the
last
word
of
Deerfoot
;
"
from
all
that
be
tell
me
about
him
in
Kentucky
,
he
be
such
a
friend
to
the
white
that
he
be
never
away
from
their
settlement
for
a
very
long
time

<EOS>
I

be
anxious

know
him

”“they

"
say
Otto
,
speak
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
“And
I
never
believe
one
half
of
them

<EOS>
the
idea
of
a
young
Shawanoe
read
his
Bible
every
day
,
and
be
able
to
write
the
prettiest
kind
of
a
band
,
be
something
that
make
us
laugh

but
every
word
of
it
be
true

as
he
prove
to
us

<EOS>
”“den

should
say
so

<EOS>
just

there

yet
he
deliver
a

to
us

explain
the
plan
he
have

,
and
then
alone
<EOS>
scare
away
the
whole
lot
,
so
we
could
out
.
<EOS>
when
you
get
back
home
and
tell
parent
this
story

what
will
they
say?”“Mine

<EOS>
”“And
I
can
not

Jack
with
a
laugh

but
it
will
be
truth

nevertheless

it
be
no

<EOS>
”“vy

a

bad

<EOS>
He
pretend
he
be
lame

which
put
the
idea
in
the
head
of
his
capture
to
have
some
fun
with
him

<EOS>
They
take
him
out
on
a
long
clearing

place
him
in

of
the
swift
warrior

and
then
tell
him
to
run

well

he
run

”“Did

such

I

would

his

I
have
no

he
have
to
send
out
a

back

”“vy

<EOS>
Deerfoot
be
a
Christian

he

Tecumseh

you

one

some

it

such
a

there
be
no

”otto

with

with
his
gun

at
no

<EOS>
the
hoof

print
show
that
the
horse
continue
to
take
matter
very
philosophically

<EOS>
His
fast
gait
be
a
leisurely
walk
,
and
often
he
stand
still
and
nibble
the
bud
of
the
vegetation
not
yet
fully
develop

<EOS>
It
be
gratify
to
find
that
in
spite
of
an
occasional
digression

general
course
be
as

<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to

steadily
make
his
ward

even
though
he
be
a
long
time
in
arrive
at
his

<EOS>
It
be
comparatively
early
in
the
afternoon
when
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
bade
them
good
-
bye
,
and
for
two
hour
the
route
undergo
little
change
;
but
at
time
,
Jack
Carleton
be
force
to
admit
that
the
course
they
be
follow
be
not
the
one
to
take
them
to
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
the
departure
of
their
friend
,
they
cross
the
trail
over
which
Otto
have
ride
some
day
before
,
and
then
the
hoof
-
print
tend
more
to
the
north
,
so
that
,
in
a
general
way
,
the
boy
take
the
direction
of
the
Mississippi
itself
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
expect
that
while
keep
a
considerable
distance
from
water
,
would
follow
its
amazing
tortuosity
,
<EOS>
probably
surpass
that
of
any
river
on
the
globe
.
<EOS>
thus
it
come
about
that
<EOS>
sometimes
Jack
and
Otto
find
themselves
close
to
the
immense
stream
<EOS>
and
then
again
they
be
a
long
way
inland

<EOS>
“it
seem
to
me
,
"
say
Jack
,
when
the
afternoon
be
draw
to
a
close
,
"
that
we
ought
be
quite
near
the
colt
;
we
have
go
steadily
forward
,
while
he
have
often
stop
,
and
as
yet
have
not
travel
faster
than
a
walk

<EOS>
”“but
<EOS>
he
start
a
long

pefore

,
"
say
Otto
.
<EOS>
“Not
so
very
long
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
thing
quite
certain
:
he
do
not
care
whether
he
find
his
way
to

not

for
he
be
not

to

<EOS>
”“he

he

turn

further
off

”“We

“he
would
do

a
glance

<EOS>
helloa!”just
<EOS>
then
Jack
,
who
be
slightly
in
advance
of
his

catch
sight
of
a
bundle
similar
that
which
the
Shawanoe
find
several
hour
before

hurry
forward
,
it
be
see
to
be
the
blanket

Jack
Carleton

which
,
like

have
come
displace
and
fall
from
the
back

the
wander
horse

like
that
,
too
,
it
be
saturate
with

the

wring

CHAPTER
XXI

<EOS>
the
NEIGH
of
a
horsethe
stray
horse
appear
to
be
distribute
the
property
of
the
boy
in
a
promiscuous
fashion
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
they
know
,
he
still
retain
his
equipment
and
a
roll
of
personal
effect
,
fasten
in
front
of
the
saddle
instead
of
behind
it
,
as
be
the
case
with
the
blanket
.
<EOS>
“seem
to
me
,
"
remark
Otto
,
who
begin
to
feel
some
weariness
and
impatience
,
"
dot
<EOS>
the
animal
ish
not
a
good
vile
get
tired
so
as
he
vant
to
sot
down
and
rest
.
<EOS>
”“he
be
likely
to
do
so
when
it
begin
to
grow
dark
,
which
will
be
before
long
,
"
add
Jack
Carleton
,
note
the
closing
day
.
<EOS>
the
friend
have
be
hopeful
from
the
first
that
they
would
overtake
the
miss
horse
before
sunset
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
cheer
by
the
belief
that
they
be
not
far
behind
him
at
the
start
,
and
it
be
certain
they
have
make
much
well
progress
than
he
,
but
it
now
look
as
if
they
be
to
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
on
the
edge
of
a
natural
clearing
,
several
acre
in
extent
and
cover
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
grass
,
they
be
sure
the
horse
be
there
,
but
a
careful
scrutiny
show
no
sign
of
him
,
though
his
track
indicate
that
he
have
crop
some
of
the
grass
before
pass
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
comparatively
easy
traveling
for
the
boy
,
the
wood
be
notably
clear
of
the
vine
and
undergrowth
,
which
often
add
to
the
labor
of
journey
through
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
yet
see
bird
,
animal
or
living
person
after
part
company
with
Deerfoot
,
and
Jack
be
conscious
more
than
once
of
a
strange
feeling
of
loneliness
,
such
as
come
over
the
traveler
when
wander
in
a
vast
and
desolate
land
.
<EOS>
“Is
this
so
different
from
Ohio
and
Kentucky
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
himself
;
"
be
there
no
Shawanoes
because
there
be
no
game
for
them
to
hunt?”he
smile
when
he
ask
himself
the
latter
question
,
for
his
own
knowledge
render
it
pointless
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
game
be
as
limitless
on
one
side
of
the
Mississippi
as
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
sun

have
go
down
behind
the
rim
of
forest

when
they

<EOS>
the

high

spirited
and
wild
,
and
the
taste
gain
of
freedom
have
undoubtedly
increase
the
difficulty
of
his
capture

<EOS>
great
caution
would
be
necessary
to
avoid
scare
him
away
altogether
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
see
also
that
if
they
frighten
the
colt
into
dash
into
the
wood
,
it
would
be
hard
,
under
any
circumstance
,
to
secure
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
run
a
good
distance
,
and
the
morrow
would
compel
another
long
and
laborious
search

<EOS>
a
simple
plan
suggest
itself
:
one
would
make
a
cautious
advance
across
the
clearing
,
while
the
other
work
his
way
around
to
the
other
side
,
so
that
the
two
would
close
in
upon
the
animal
,
as
may
be
say
,
and
if
he
flee
from
the
first
he
would
run
into
the
custody
of
the
second
.
<EOS>
as
Jack
be
quick
in
his
movement
,
beside
be
a
well
horseman
,
than
Otto
,
it
be
agree
that
he
should
pass
through
the
wood
until
beyond
the
animal
;
when
he
arrive
at
the
proper
point
be
be
to
notify
Otto
by
mean
of
the
whistle
which
have
serve
them
so
often
as
a
signal
.
<EOS>
then
the
young
German
would
use
the
most
seductive
method
of
which
he
be
master
soothe
the
colt
into
submission
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
fear
be
that
in
the
gloom
the
animal
would
fail
to
recognize
his
master
an
would
be
unusually
timid
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
the
moon
would
shed
no
light
on
the
scene
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
from
what
have
be
say
it
will
be
admit
that
the
friend
have
undertake
a
delicate
and
difficult
task
.
<EOS>
but
the
anxiety
of
both
to
obtain
the
animal
be
too
great
for
them
to
throw
away
an
opportunity
,
however
slight

<EOS>
Jack
,
therefore
,
pass
the
few
pace
necessary
to
reach
the

the

<EOS>
the

he
must

acceptable

hold
his

reach

point
beyond

lay
down

begin
his
cautious

walk
straight

the

if
he
have
do
so

it

so

stump

He
be
speechless

stand
still

wonder

make
such

blunder

a
tree
close

remain
that

seem
indeed
as

have
arrive
in

strange
latitude

he
catch

when
a
shock
like
that
from
an
electric
battery
go
through
him
,
cause
by
the
single
exclamation:“oof!”it
be
the
hail
of
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
Otto
be
rivet
to
the
spot
by
the
sight
of
a
brawny
savage
stride
toward
him
.
<EOS>
He
come
from
the
darkness
of
the
wood
,
and
,
when
he
move
into
the
clearing
,
be
just
in
time
to
catch
the
first
beam
of
the
moon
rise
above
the
forest
.
<EOS>
the
warrior
be
large
,
and
his
size
be
magnify
by
the
blanket
,
which
,
wrap
like
a
shawl
about
him
,
reach
below
his
knee
.
<EOS>
the
long
,
black
hair
dangle
around
his
shoulder
,
be
ornament
at
the
crown
by
a
number
of
eagle
feather
;
but
the
countenance
,
when
show
by
the
moonlight
,
be
devoid
of
paint
,
which
,
it
may
be
say
,
be
not
need
to
add
to
its
ugliness
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
be
low
and
broad
,
the
eye
small
,
black
and
restless
,
while
the
cheek
-
bone
be
not
only
protuberant
,
but
be
unusually
far
apart
.
<EOS>
instead
of
the
aquiline
nose
,
which
be
so
often
a
feature
of
the
American
Indian
,
his
be
as
broad
as
that
of
the
african
,
badly
disfigure
by
a
scar
across
the
bridge
,
probably
make
by
a
knife
or
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
state
that
his
mouth
be
wide
than
that
of
Otto
,
enough
have
be
say
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
in
one
corner
,
the
warrior
hold
a
pipe
make
of
red
clay
,
whose
stem
be
a
foot
in
length
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
stand
placidly
puff
this
during
the
entire
time
the
boy
be
steal
upon
the
supposed
horse
.
<EOS>
in
the
increase
moonlight
,
the
strong
vapor
rise
in
blue
puff
from
both
side
of
his
face
and
poison
the
air
above
and
around
him
.
<EOS>
the
position
of
the
Indian
be
such
that
the
blanket
cover
both
arm
,
and
Otto
could
not
see
whether
or
not
he
grasp
a
rifle
beneath
.
<EOS>
the
entire
manner
of
the
red
man
show
that
he
know
he
be
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
feel
otherwise
,
when
he
see
a
partly
grow
boy
stand
before
him
,
without
any
firearm
with
which
to
defend
himself
.
<EOS>
“Howdy
,
brudder
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
in
a
gruff
,
guttural
voice
,
extend
his
huge
hand
to
Otto
,
who
dare
not
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
“I
isb
—
ish
<EOS>
—
dot
be
—
ish
<EOS>
well
,
"
stammer
the
poor
fellow
,
vainly
try
to
speak
in
a
steady
voice
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
give
a
fervency
to
his
grip
of
Otto
's
finger
which
make
him
wince
with
pain
,
though
he
dare
utter
no
protest
.
<EOS>
the
act
of
the
warrior
in
advance
and
salute
,
cause
his
blanket
to
open
in
front
,
so
as
to
disclose
an
untidy
sash
around
his
waist
.
<EOS>
the
view
be
not
clear
,
as
the
ray
of
the
moon
come
over
his
shoulder
,
but
the
lad
see
enough
to
satisfy
him
that
the
Indian
carry
a
tomahawk
and
hunting
-
knife
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
other
hand
remove
the
pipe
from
between
the
leathern
lip
and
hold
it
,
there
be
no
instant
intention
of
use
either
weapon
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
justice
to
the
young
german
to
say
that
,
have
he
possess
his
gun
,
he
would
not
have
permit
the
Indian
to
take
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
treacherous
character
of
the
race
too
well
to
give
them
the
least
advantage
;
but
his
belief
be
that
the
good
,
and
indeed
the
only
thing
to
do
,
be
to
avoid
,
so
far
as
he
could
,
give
any
offence
to
his
captor
.
<EOS>
“Ven
<EOS>
he
do
not
be
look
at
me
,
"
be
Otto
's
thought
,
"
then
I
give
him
the
slip
,
and
run
and
got
mine
gun
,
and
shoot
him
afore

”The
<EOS>
programme
be
a
good
one
,
provide
it
could
be
carry
out
,
but
it
can
not
be
admit
that
it
offer
much
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
Otto
be
never
fleet
of
foot
,
and
as
his
rifle
be
fully
a
hundred
yard
distant
,
there
be
no
way
of
recover
it
except
by
permission
of
the
red
man
.
<EOS>
“Where
brudder
's
home
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
query
,
as
he
allow
the
hand
of
the
lad
to
fall
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Otto
feel
authorize
to
answer
that
question
at
least
truthfully
.
<EOS>
“good
way
from
dish
place
—
a
way
off
yonder
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
boy
mean
to
locate
his
home
correctly
,
but
when
he
point
toward
the
north
,
he
unconsciously
make
a
great
error
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
unimportant
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
slowly
shove
the
stem
of
the
pipe
in
the
comer
of
his
immense
mouth
,
send
out
several
pungent
puff
towards
the
face
of
Otto
,
who
,
accustom
as
he
be
to
the
sickening
odor
of
his
father
's
tobacco
,
be
force
to
recoil
a
step
and
cough
the
strangle
vapor
from
him
.
<EOS>
then
the
warrior
solemnly
turn
his
head
and
look
behind
in
the
gloomy
depth
of
the
wood
,
as
though
he
expect
to
see
the
home
of
the
boy
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
to
say
that
,
if
such
be
his
expectation
,
he
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
when
Otto
observe
the
face
of
his
dread
captor
turn
away
,
he
be
thrill
by
the
sudden
belief
that
the
chance
for
which
he
have
be
pray
have
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
time
to
make
a
sudden
dash
,
regain
his
gun
,
and
become
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
?
<EOS>
beyond
question
,
it
be
literally
life
or
death
with
the
lad
.
<EOS>
the
red
man
would
pursue
and
show
him
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
if
Otto
fail
to
reach
his
rifle
in
time
,
a
second
trial
would
never
be
give
him
.
<EOS>
absurd
!
<EOS>
he
see
there
be
not
an
earthly
chance
of
success
;
he
could
only
wait
and
hope
.
<EOS>
fail
to
discern
the
log
cabin
in
which
Otto
make
his
home
,
the
Indian
turn
back
his
head
,
swinge
it
as
on
a
pivot
,
so
that
the
end
of
the
pipe

for

“Where

nervously
anxious
to
escape

anything
which
would
give
his
captor
a
clue
to
his
property

<EOS>
the
warrior
do
not
press
the
question
,
as
he
may
easily
have
do
,
but
he
smoke
his
pipe
another
minute
in
dignified
silence
,
while
Otto
stand
tremble
and
wonder
how
many
more
breathe
he
would
be
permit
to
draw
before
the
savage
would
leap
upon

“Brudder

oof!”this
be
the
first
announcement
the

make
of
his

the
declaration
that

chief
astonish
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
hold
no
suspicion
that
he
be
in
the
presence

such
a
dignitary

<EOS>
but
he
have
be
command
to
go
with
him
,
and
the
youth
could
only
await
more
pointed
instruction
.
<EOS>
the
Osage
motion
him
to
turn
about
and
he
do
so
,
hopeful
that
his
captor
mean
to
drive
him
across
the
clearing
toward
the
spot
he
and
Jack
Carleton
have
fix
upon
for
their
camp
.
<EOS>
if
such
be
the
intention
of
the
chief
,
it
would
be
extremely
favorable
to
the
lad
,
but
,
unfortunately
,
the
opposite
course
be
the
one
fix
upon
.
<EOS>
while
Otto
's
face
be
away
from
his
master

the
latter
stalk
around
in
his
front

where

take
the

dusky

he
repeat
his

by

the

,
when

he
do
so

<EOS>
while

Otto
unwittingly

“oof

catch
him
by

him
part
way
around

be
startle
,
for
the

of
that
violent
nature

it

him
severely

<EOS>
It
effectually
dissipate
his

of
make
a
break
for
liberty

at

until
a
much
more
promising
opening
present
itself
.
<EOS>
He
begin
timidly
feel
his
way
through
the
darkness
,
dread
every
moment
that
he
would
take
a
misstep
,
that
would
bring
down
the
anger
of
the
Indian
in
a
more
dangerous
form
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
be
envelop
in
gloom
,
so
that
he
keep
both
hand
extend
in
front
to
protect
his
face
.
<EOS>
“I
go
as
right
as
I
can
,
"
he
observe
,
seek
to
avert
the
wrath
of
the
terrible
being
that
be
at
his
heel
:
"
when
I
do
not
go
right
dot
ish

because
I
go
wrong
—

gracious!”It
be
only
a
twig
which
just
then
collide
with
his
eye

<EOS>
It
inflict
no

,
and
he
still
push
forward
as
obediently
as
if
it
be
his

him

<EOS>
the
Indian
say
nothing
,
but
he
rustle
the
leave
with
his
moccasin
,
as
if
to
prevent
the

forget
his

.
<EOS>
here
and
there
the
arrowy
moonlight
pierce
the
foliage
and
afford
Otto
a
glimpse
of
his
surrounding
,
but
most
of
the
time
the
gloom
be
so
dense
as
to
be
absolutely
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
pass
across
a
dimly
-
light
space
,
he
could
not
avoid
turn
his
head
and
look
back
at
the
Osage
chief
as
he
step
into
the
feeble
light
.
<EOS>
the
figure
of
the
Indian
be
strike
.
<EOS>
He
be
stride
slowly
along
,
as
if
impressed
with
his
own
importance
,
his
arm
fold
beneath
the
blanket
in
front
,
so
as
to
hold
it
together
and
keep
them
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
His
tooth
be
still
closed
on
the
red
pipe
-
stem
,
and
the
blue
puff
pass
over
his
head
as
if
it
be
steam
which
be
work
the
machinery
of
his
leg
.
<EOS>
the
thought
which
constantly
remain
with
Otto
Relstaub
,
and
which
cause
him
the
keen
suffering
,
be
that
the
Indian
be
likely
at
any
moment
to
leap
upon
him
with
uplifted
knife
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
characteristic
of
the
american
race
that
its
representative
often
add
to
the
distress
of
their
captive
by
toy
with
them
as
a
cat
do
with
a
mouse
before
crunch
it
in
its
jaw
.
<EOS>
the
lad
be
almost
certain
his
captor
mean
to
slay
him
,
after
first
torture
him
in
this
manner
,
but
the
poor
boy
could
see
no
possible
way
in
which
to
help
himself
.
<EOS>
if
the
savage
should
spring
upon
him
,
it
would
be
like
the
leap
of
the
panther
-
quick
,
crush
,
and
resistless
in
its
fury
.
<EOS>
with
a
faint
hope
that
he
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
himself
when
the
bad
should
come
,
Otto
stealthily
draw
out
his
hunting
-
knife
,
and
hold
it
tightly
grasp
.
<EOS>
one
thing
be
certain
,
that
,
weak
and
almost
helpless
as
he
be
,
he
would
not
submit
without
make
a
good

It

and
the
spectator

there
be
absolutely
but
a
single
line
of
advance
which
would
keep
it
in

<EOS>
the
Indian
give
no

to
his
view

the
rustling
leave
tell
that

step
quickly
past

Otto
have
secure

so
to

so
far

he
advance

view
of
his

<EOS>
the
wigwam
of
the
Osage
chieftain
be
similar
to
those
which
may
be
find
to
-
day
on
the
slope
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
in
the
depth
of
the
wilderness
along
the
Assiniboine
,
on
the
shore
of
Athabasca
Lake
in
the
far
North
,
and
beyond
the
Llano
Estacado
of
the
South

<EOS>
It
be
model
in
the

style
that
be
fashionable
when
Columbus
see
the
light
of
the
New
World
twinkle
through
the
gloom
of
the
night
across
the
unknown
sea
,
and
which
will
prevail
so
long
as
the
American
Indian
roam
the
wood
and
wield
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
a
half
dozen
pole
be
push
into
the
ground
in
a
rude
circle
,
so
as
to
include
a
space
between
four

five
yard
in
diameter
.
<EOS>
the
top
of
the
pole
join
,
as

the
bayonet
of

<EOS>
this
framework
be
cover
with
the
skin
of
bison
and
deer
,
sew
together
with
the

of
the

<EOS>
at
the
peak
of
the
roof
be
an
opening
a

partly

<EOS>
this

directly
opposite

,
be
the
opening
which
serve
as
a

there

<EOS>
the
deer

skin
could
be
fling

hang
down
.
<EOS>
if
the
wind
set
it
to
flap

it
be
pin

or
sharp
stick
.
<EOS>
the
ground
in
most
place
be
cover
with
bison
-
skin
,
so
that
in
moderately
cold
weather
they
be
comfortable
and
pleasant
to
sit
and
recline
upon
.
<EOS>
the
skin
compose
the
side
of
the
wigwam
be
soil
with
smoke
,
grease
and
dirt
for
alas
!
<EOS>
nearly
all
the
romance
and
charm
envelop
the
American
Indian
be
dissipate
at
first
sight
by
his
frightful
lack
of
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
but
Otto
Relstaub
have
view
the
interior
of
Indian
wigwam
before
,
and
his
interest
be
fix
upon
the
occupant
,
of
whom
there
be
three
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
the
squaw
or
wife
of
the
chief
be
at
the
further
end
,
or
rather
the
side
opposite
the
door
,
busy
broil
two
slice
of
venison
on
the
coal
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
kettle
,
pan
,
knife
or
fork
in
the
lodge
,
her
sole
implement
be
a
sharpen
stick
,
scarcely
a
foot
in

,
which
she
use
in
turn
and
handle
the
meat
.
<EOS>
when
Otto
come
tumble
through
the
door
,
the
mistress
be
in
the
act
of
lift
one
of
the
slice
from
the
coal
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
her
knee
,
and
pause
for
a
second
with
the
meat
in
air
,
while
she
glance
around
to
see
whether
her
lord
and
master
have
be
imbibe
too
much
fire
-
water
.
<EOS>
one
glance
be
enough
,
and
she
turn
back
and
give
her
attention
to
the
culinary
operation
.
<EOS>
She
wear
moccasin
,
legging
,
and
a
species
of
loose
hunting

shirt
,
tie
with
a
cord
about
the
waist
,
and
which
protect
her

body
quite
well

though
the

skin
composing
it
look
as
if
it
have
serve
as
a
part
of
the

for
a
number
of
year

<EOS>
Her
long
,
black
hair
dangle
about
her
shoulder
,
as
do
that
of
her
husband
,
and
she
be
no
more
cleanly
in
her
person
than
be
he
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
most
interesting
object
in
the
place
be
an
indian
infant
,
less
than
a
year
old
,
which
lie
on
a
bison
-
robe
not
far
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
male
,
too
young
to
walk
,
though
it
have
be
free
from
the
coffin
-
like
cradle
in
which
the
aboriginal
baby
be
strap
and
carry
on
the
back
of
their
mother
.
<EOS>
the
little
fellow
be
cover
to
his
arm

pit

the
bare
arm
lie
outside
on
the
bison
-
robe
.
<EOS>
He
keep
these
go
in
an
awkward
,
spasmodic
fashion
,
which
cause
the
infantile
fist
now
and
then
to
land
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
the
organ
wink
very
suddenly
,
and
the
boy
seem
to
start
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
,
but
he
do
not
cry
.
<EOS>
young
as
he
be
,
he
have
be
train
in
the
iron
school
which
make
the
american
indian
indifferent
to
suffering
and
torture
.
<EOS>
this
aboriginal
youth
show
more
interest
in
the
new
arrival
than
do
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
His
fist
become
motionless
,
his
head
flap
over
on
one
side
,
and
the
twinkle
black
eye
be
fix
upon
Otto
as
though
they
would
read
him
through
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
recall
the
fancy
that
flit
through
our
brain
at
that
early
stage
of
existence
,
what
a
wonderful
kaleidoscope
<EOS>
it
would
present!the
<EOS>
limit
of
the

be
so
moderate
that
the

most

<EOS>
seat
himself
on

just

he

lean

with
his

and
his

he
placidly
smoke
his
pipe
and
await
supper

<EOS>
the
wife
answer
with
what
sound
like
a
half
dozen

,
but
do
not
look
around
or
cease
give
her
full

to
the

the

there

the

<EOS>
the

the

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
<EOS>
DEERFOOTWhen
Deerfoot
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
bade
good
-
by
to
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
<EOS>
,
it
be
with
the
declaration
that
they
would
soon
see
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
precisely
what
he
mean
would
be
hard
to
say
;
but
probably
it
imply
that
he
would
take
pain
in
the
near
future
to
make
them
a
visit
when
they
should
be
settle
in
their
own
log
-
cabin
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
leave
them
,
as
have
be
intimate
,
because
he
believe
there
be
no
further
need
of
bear
them
company
,
and
because
business
of
great
importance
to
himself
demand
that
he
should
take
another
course
,
and
travel
many
long
mile
toward
that
wild
region
in
the
southern
part
of
Missouri
,
which
be
break
and
cross
by
the
Ozark
range
of
mountain
.
<EOS>
for
fully
an
hour
after
he
turn
away
from
his
friend
he
push
through
the
forest
in
a
south
-
western
direction
.
<EOS>
He
advance
at
a
leisurely
pace
,
for
there
be
no
call
for
haste
,
and
he
love
to
be
alone
in
the
vast
solitude
,
where
be
often
hold
sweet
communion
with
the
Great
Spirit
,
whom
he
worship
and
adore
with
a
fervency
of
devotion
scarcely
know
except
by
those
who
have
die
for
His
sake
.
<EOS>
the
sun
have
descend
but
a
brief
way
in
the
western
sky
when
the
youthful
warrior
find
himself
steadily
climb
an
elevation
of
several
hundred
foot
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
over
the
ground
before
,
and
he
know
that
,
after
pass
the
ridge
,
the
surface
slope
downward
for
many
mile
,
shut
the
Mississippi
out
of
sight
altogether
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
a
suspicion
have
be
steadily
take
shape
in
the
mind
of
Deerfoot
,
and
it
be
that
which
lead
him
to
hasten
his
footstep
until
he
reach
the
crest
of
the
elevation
,
where
he
pause
to
make
an
investigation
.
<EOS>
the
thought
which
run
through
his
mind
be
the
probability
that
all
danger
from
the
Miamis
and
Shawanoes
(
especially
the
latter
)
be
not
yet
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
He
reason
from
well
establish
fact
;
they
know
beyond
question
that
it
be
he
who
have
outwit
them
in
his
effort
to
save
the
boy
when
they
be
place
in
such
extreme
peril
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoes
hate
him
with
an
intensity
beyond
description
,
and
,
despite
the
repeat
disaster
which
have
overtake
those
who
seek
,
his
ruin
,
they
would
strive
by
every
means
to
revenge
themselves
upon
him
.
<EOS>
what
more
likely
,
therefore
,
than
that
they
have
cross
the
Mississippi
in
pursuit
?
<EOS>
the
certainty
that
they
have
do
so
would
have
cause
Deerfoot
no
misgiving
,
so
far
as
he
be
concern
,
but
his
fear
be
for
the
boy
.
<EOS>
He
reason
that
the
Shawanoes
would
follow
the
trail
of
the
three
,
include
also
that
of
the
stray
horse
.
<EOS>
when
they
reach
the
point
where
Deerfoot
leave
them
they
would
read
its
meaning
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
They
would
know
the
white
be
follow
the
animal
,
while
the
Shawanoe
have
go
about
his
own
business
.
<EOS>
deprive
of
his
matchless
guidance
and
skill
,
the
destruction
of
Jack
and
Otto
would
seem
so
easy
that
two
or
three
would
hasten
after
them
.
<EOS>
the
action
of
their
guide
would
naturally
imply
that
he
have
no
thought
of
any
such
attempt
on
the
part
of
his
enemy
,
who
,
therefore
,
would
be
the
more
strongly
tempt
to
go
in
quest
of
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
say
,
Deerfoot
could
laugh
at
all
such
strategy
when
direct
against
himself
,
but
he
be
uneasy
about
the
other
,
who
would
never
think
of
their
danger
until
too
late
.
<EOS>
ordinarily
they
be
not
likely
to
encounter
any
red
man
,
except
the
half
friendly
Osages
,
and
would
be
without
protection
against
a
stealthy
shot
from
the
wood
behind
them
.
<EOS>
if
such
an
issue
threaten
,
Deerfoot
feel
that
his
duty
be
clear
:
he
must
spare
no
effort
to
protect
the
boy
to
the
last
extremity
,
and
it
be
the
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
catch
sight
of
some
almost
invisible
sign
which
would
tell
the
truth
that
lead
him
to
halt
on
the
crest
of
the
elevation
and
gaze
long
and
searchingly
toward
the
Dark
and
Bloody
Ground
,
which
have
be
the
scene
of
so
many
fearful
encounter
between
the
pioneer
and
untamable
red
man
.
<EOS>
the
great
river
be
several
mile
distant
,
the
almost
unbroken
forest
stretch
between
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
narrowly
scrutinize
the
yellow
surface
as
far
as
the
eye
could
follow
the
winding
course
,
but
not
the
first
evidence
of
life
be
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
not
a
solitary
canoe
or
wild
animal
breast
the
swift
current
which
be
now
laden
with
thousand
of
craft
of
almost
every
description
.
<EOS>
the
searcher
after
truth
hardly
expect
to
discover
anything
on
the
river
itself
,
for
if
the
Shawanoes
be
hunt
for
him
they
have
cross
long
before
;
but
away
beyond
,
in
the
solemn
depth
of
the
Kentucky
wilderness
,
burn
a
camp
-
fire
,
whose
faint
smoke
could
be
trace
as
it
rise
above
the
tree
-
top
.
<EOS>
a
careful
study
of
the
vapor
lead
Deerfoot
to
suspect
that
it
have
serve
as
a
signal
,
but
it
be
beyond
his
ken
to
determine
its
nature
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
which
could
afford
the
faint
clew
,
and
he
begin
the
study
of
Louisiana
,
so
far
as
it
be
open
to
his
vision
.
<EOS>
His
altitude
give
him
an
extended
survey
toward
every
point
of
the
compass
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
impossible
that
any
of
his
enemy
should
be
to
the
west
of
him
,
he
do
not
bestow
so
much
as
a
glance
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
again
and
again
the
keen
eye
rove
over
the
space
between
him
and
the
great
stream
,
but
nothing
reward
the
visual
search
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
expect
that
if
the
Shawanoes
be
steal
along
his
trail
they
would
stop
to
build
a
fire
—
at
least
not
before
night
close
in
.
<EOS>
the
only
circumstance
under
which
they
would
attempt
anything
of
the
kind
would
be
in
the
event
of
their
wishing
to
signal
some
message
to
those
leave
on
the
other
shore
.
<EOS>
possibly
they
want
reinforcement
,
or
wish
those
who
be
in
wait
to
make
some
movement
of
their
own
,
and
,
if
so
they
would
be
sure
to
telegraph
.
<EOS>
if
such
be
the
case
,
the
telegram
have
be
send
and
the
instrument
—
that
is
,
the
camp
-
fire
have
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
sort
be
now
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
but
Deerfoot
do
discover
something
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
a
long
distance
away
could
be
detect
another
column
of
vapor
—
slight
,
but
dark
,
and
with
a
wavy
,
shudder
motion
,
such
as
be
observe
when
the
first
smoke
from
the
fire
under
an
engine
rise
through
the
tall
,
brick
chimney
.
<EOS>
He
watch
it
fixedly
for
several
minute
and
then
smile
,
for
he
rightly
interpret
its
meaning
.
<EOS>
“There
be
the

with
his

in
the

,
and

his

.
<EOS>
He
care
not
for
Miami
or
Huron
or
Shawanoe
,
but
smoke
in
peace
.
<EOS>
”inasmuch
<EOS>
,
as
no
other
vapor
meet
the
eye
,
the
sagacious
Shawanoe
adopt
a
very
different
line
of
investigation
,
or
rather
research
.
<EOS>
He
be
able
to
tell
where
the
less
elevation
stand
,
on
which
he
have
bid
good
-
by
to
the
boy
,
and
could
form
a
tolerably
correct
idea
of
the
line
he
have
follow
since
then
.
<EOS>
if
the
Shawanoes
be
push
the
search
for
him
,
several
must
be
somewhere
along
that
line
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
time
they
would
be
effectually
hide
from
sight
by
the
foliage
of
the
tree
,
but
there
be
open
place
here
and
there
(
very
slight
in
extent
)
,
where
they
would
be
visible
for
the
moment
to
one
who
fix
his
eye
on
that
particular
spot
.
<EOS>
on
the
site
of
the
encampment
,
where
the
little
party
have
eat
their
meal
,
and
where
not
the
slight
ember
remain
,
the
pursuer
would
halt
for
a
brief
consultation
.
<EOS>
if
they
divide
into
two
company
of
pursuit
,
it
be
there
the
division
have
take
or
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
the
vegetation
be
so
abundant
just
there
,
that
he
could
not
hope
to
catch
sight
of
any
of
his
enemy
,
until
after
they
should
reach
a
point
a
considerable
distance
away
.
<EOS>
It
would
therefore
seem
impossible
for
him
to
tell
whether
a
portion
of
the
war
party
turn
to
the
northward
in
quest
of
the
boy
,
or
whether
they
all
concentrate
in
the
search
for
Deerfoot
himself
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
beyond
his
power
,
I
say
,
for
the
extraordinary
youth
to
settle
the
question
,
while
stand
carefully
hide
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
but
a
single
slight
chance
present
itself
,
and
to
that
he
appeal
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
general
direction
of
the
horse
's
trail
after
it
have
leave
the
spot
where
Deerfoot
part
company
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
unless
it
turn
abruptly
to
the
right
or
leave
,
it
lead
across
an
open
space
,
which
be
in
plain
view
of
the
Shawanoe
,
and
provide
the
crossing
have
not
already
be
make
,
he
would
be
able
to
observe
it
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
watch
this
opening
with
a
keenness
which
would
permit
nothing
to
elude
it
.
<EOS>
His
brain
have
handle
the
problem
with
the
certainty
of
intuition
.
<EOS>
follow
a
process
of
reasoning
which
can
not
be
fully
explain
,
he
convince
himself
that
the
redskin
have
not
yet
flee
across
the
narrow
space
.
<EOS>
whether
they
be
to
do
so
or
not
would
be
determine
in
a
brief
while
.
<EOS>
if
the
savage
hunt
Jack
and
Otto
have
go
beyond
the
point
name
,
before
Deerfoot
fix
his
attention
on
it
,
then
it
follow
of
necessity
that
those
who
be
so
eager
to
suspend
the
scalp
of
the
youth
from
the
ridge
-
pole
of
their
wigwam
be
at
that
moment
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
in
any
event
,
he
be
morally
certain
the
whole
question
would
be
settle
within
the
come
hour
,
for
,
if
no
sign
appear
,
it
would
be
a
sign
of
itself
that
nothing
be
to
be
fear
.
<EOS>
fully
aware
of
the
woodcraft
of
his
own
people
,
Deerfoot
throw
away
no
chance
.
<EOS>
He
keep
closely
hide
behind
the
tree
which
serve
as
a
screen
,
as
though
an
enemy
be
in
ambush
within
bowshot
.
<EOS>
He
wait
a
briefer
time
than
he
anticipate
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
flit
hither
and
thither
,
when
a
couple
of
warrior
deliberately
walk
across
the
opening
on
which
his
attention
be
fix
.
<EOS>
though
only
two
,
they
move
in
indian
file
,
one
directly
behind
the
other
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
they
be
after
the
scalp
of
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
.
<EOS>
It
be
equally
certain
that
a
large
number
be
hunt
for
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
the
fact
would
not
have
cause
him
an
additional
throb
of
the
pulse
,
could
he
have
be
assure
that
no
harm
,
would
befall
his
friend
.
<EOS>
true
,
they
have
display
much
courage
and
brilliancy
a
few
hour
before
in
their
contest
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
it
would
seem
that
,
with
their
training
from
early
youth
,
they
ought
to
be
able
to
protect
themselves
against
an
equal
number
of
red
man

<EOS>
but
,
reason
on
the
matter
as
he
choose
,
Deerfoot
could
not
drive
away
the
feeling
that
it
be
his
duty
to
go
to
their
help

<EOS>
“the

will

<EOS>
”clearly
<EOS>
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
take
the

for
that
would
insure
a

CHAPTER
XXV
.
<EOS>
AT
BAYThe
"
old
indian
"
assert
itself
in
Deerfoot
the
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
while
every
act
,
and
in
deed
every
thought
,
of
the
wonderful
young
warrior
be
prompt
by
conscience
,
yet
his
view
of
duty
under
certain
circumstance
,
be
fit
to
bring
a
smile
to
the
face
of
an
impartial
judge
.
<EOS>
while
stand
behind
the
tree
on
the
crest
of
the
elevation
,
he
be
sure
of
two
thing
:
he
have
little
time
to
lose
in
go
to
the
help
of
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
,
and
the
Shawanoes
who
be
trail
him
be
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
settle
the
dispute
by
decide
to
stay
where
he
be
a
few
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
if
his
enemy
do
not
appear
within
that
brief
period
,
he
would
hasten
from
the
spot
.
<EOS>
this
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
young
Shawanoe
presage
a
desperate
encounter
between
him
and
his
foe
,
and
he
make
preparation
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
set
his
rifle
on
the
ground
,
with
the
muzzle
lean
against
the
tree
which
serve
to
screen
his
body
,
and
bring
his
long
bow
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
draw
an
arrow
from
its
quiver
,
he
glance
at
it
as
if
look
for
some
defect
,
but
he
know
none
be
there
,
nor
be
a
single
shaft
of
the
score
and
a
half
in
the
quiver
imperfect
in
any
respect
.
<EOS>
the
youth
always
make
his
own
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
glue
on
the
feather
which
guide
and
steady
the
missile
in
its
flight
,
and
he
fasten
the
head
with
metal
obtain
from
the
white
.
<EOS>
every
one
of
his
possession
have
be
test
and
prove
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
grasp
the
bow
loosely
in
the
centre
,
one
finger
of
the
same
band
also
hold
the
arrow
in
place
,
with
the
notch
against
the
deer
sinew
,
not
yet
draw
backward
.
<EOS>
the
amateur
archer
will
understand
that
he
be
in
form
to
bring
the
shaft
to
a
head
on
the
instant
it
should
become
necessary
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
five
minute
after
he
have
assume
this
position
,
and
while
look
back
over
his
own
trail
,
that
two
Shawanoe
warrior
silently
emerge
from
the
bush
fifty
yard
off
,
and
stealthily
approach
him
.
<EOS>
They
move
absolutely
without
noise
,
for
their
woodcraft
tell
them
they
be
close
upon
the
most
dangerous
being
they
have
ever
undertake
to
hunt
.
<EOS>
the
foremost
lift
his
foot
just
clear
of
the
ground
and
place
it
squarely
down
again
.
<EOS>
His
head
and
shoulder
be
throw
forward
,
so
that
most
of
his
long
,
coarse
,
black
hair
dangle
on
both
side
of
his
neck
and
over
his
chest
.
<EOS>
It
hang
in
front
of
his
face
also
,
and
,
as
his
forehead
be
very
low
,
he
have
the
appearance
,
while
continually
glance
from
side
to
side
and
in
front
,
of
a
wild
beast
glare
from
behind
a
hedge
.
<EOS>
He
trail
his
rifle
in
his
right
hand
,
the
left
rest
on
the
handle
of
a
knife
,
which
,
with
that
of
a
tomahawk
,
protrude
from
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
He
wear
the
usual
hunting
-
shirt
,
legging
and
moccasin
,
his
body
and
limb
be
well
protect
.
<EOS>
His
blanket
would
have
be
only
an
encumbrance
,
and
while
he
be
engage
in
such
delicate
business
,
it
be
leave
with
the
canoe
on
the
bank
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
the
ear
when
visible
through
the
dangling
hair
,
be
see
to
hold
enormous
ring
of
bone
,
while
the
nose
hook
over
and
dip
in
a
fashion
that
show
that
the
organ
have
at
some
time
hold
a
pendant
in
the
way
of
an
ornament
.
<EOS>
the
countenance
be
blacken
and
disfigure

prevent

the

make

drop
to

to

the

hardly
follow

<EOS>
while

in

so
,
his
companion
emit
an
ear
-
splitting
screech
which
make
the
wood
echo

<EOS>
He
catch
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
him
as
he
leap
high
in
the
air
and
fall
backward
,
carry
with
him
the
arrow
of
the
marvelous
archer

which

go
clear

a
defiant
shout
rang
from
the

peep
timidly
forth

the

red

see
Deerfoot
hold
his

aloft
with

while
he
swing
the

with
the

strode
off

his

toward
his
pursuer

<EOS>
“Where
be
the
Shawanoes
?
<EOS>
do
they
love
to
follow
Deerfoot
across

<EOS>
His
heart
be
sad
for
them
because
so
many
bow
to
his
bow
and
arrow
—
so
he
leave
them
that
his
eye
may
not
look
on
their

who
fall
by

the
Shawanoes
be
fool

because
they
follow
Deerfoot

<EOS>
They
can
not
harm
him

for
he
be
the
friend
of
the
white
man

and
the
Great
Spirit
give
him
his

let
the
Shawanoes

not

”the

that

the

in

his

in

all
stand

if

they
become

whoever
cross

do
so
at
his
peril

<EOS>
He
have
voluntarily

they
would
be
wise
if
they
leave
him
alone

<EOS>
He
would
not
flee
from
them
like
a
hunted
deer

but
would
teach
them
severer
lesson
than
they
have

<EOS>
the
death

yell
of
the
stricken
Shawanoe
be
certain
to
bring

Deerfoot

It

<EOS>

he

with

he
could

<EOS>
though
he
have
live

it
be

his

hurry
to
the
spot

They

precisely
eight
Shawanoes
(
not

paddle
over

Mississippi
to

the
youth
:
the
only
two
absent
from

party
be
pursue
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
,
while
they
journey
toward
the
northwest
,
after
the
stray
horse
.
<EOS>
the
occasion
,
therefore
,
be
a
fitting
one
in
which
to
consult
as
to
the
line
of
policy
to
be
follow
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
incredible
,
but
it
be
an
unquestioned
fact
,
that
five
of
the
good
warrior
of
the
most
formidable
tribe
in
the
West
decide
to
give
up
the
attempt
to
capture
or
kill
a
single
one
of
their
race
whose
year
be
considerably
less
than
those
of
the
young
member
of
the
party
,
and
that
,
too
,
on
the
ground
that
the
undertaking
be
too
dangerous
.
<EOS>
one
of
those
five
Shawanoes
,
become
convert
to
Christianity
after
the
war
of
1812
,
and
settle
in
Kentucky
,
near
the
home
of
Ned
Preston
,
to
whom
he
give
the
particular
of
the
council
hold
by
him
and
his
comrade
more
than
twenty
year
before
.
<EOS>
of
course
no
one
of
the
five
admit
that
personally
he
be
afraid
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
all
express
the
great
eagerness
to
meet
him
,
where
a
chance
to
engage
in
fatal
combat
could
be
gain
.
<EOS>
apparently
no
great
boon
could
befall
them
than
such
extreme
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
shut
their
eye
to
one
or
two
discouraging
fact
:
they
have
enter
a
country
entirely
strange
to
them
,
but
which
be
familiar
in
a
great
measure
to
the
fleet
-
foot
traitor
,
who
could
never
find
himself
lack
for
some
hole
in
which
to
hide
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
much
like
hunt
in
an
endless
forest
for
the
fawn
that
leave
no
scent
for
the
dog
to
follow
.
<EOS>
but
bad
than
all
,
the
Shawanoes
could
not
doubt
that
the
execrated
Deerfoot
have
form
alliance
with
the
Osages
,
who
would
give
him
help
whenever
want
.
<EOS>
such
be
their
theory
follow
that
they
be
not
flee
from
a
despised
foe
,
but
from
a
whole
tribe
of
Indians
.
<EOS>
for
five
warrior
to
withdraw
in
the
face
of
such
overwhelming
odd
,
could
not
be
construe
as
cowardice
,
but
only
as
wise
discretion
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
ground
on
which
the
party
base
their
decision
,
which
be
accompany
fierce
lamentation
that
the
fate
have
interpose
to
save
Deerfoot
from
their
vengeance
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
talk
that
way
,
"
say
the
old
indian
,
long
year
afterward
,
while
tell
the
story
in
break
English
,
"
and
,
"
he
add
with
a
laugh
twinkle
in
his
dark
eye
,
"
we
much
brave
—
we
want
to
meet
Deerfoot
<EOS>
but
we
look
to
see
he
do
not
come
;
if
he
come
,
then
we
would
not
be
so
much
brave
;
we
turn
,
and
run
like
buffalo
,
we
much
afraid
of
Deerfoot
;
we
no
want
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
”chapter
<EOS>
XXVI
.
<EOS>
an
unexpected
interviewhaving
turn
his
back
on
his
pursuer
,
Deerfoot
give
them
no
further
attention
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
now
be
to
defend
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
from
the
two
red
man
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
the
youthful
warrior
have
fix
in
his
own
mind
the
course
take
by
the
other
,
and
he
hasten
to
a
point
where
he
be
hopeful
of
find
the
trail
.
<EOS>
but
the
calculation
which
lead
him
thither
be
draw
too
fine
.
<EOS>
like
the
detective
who
spin
a
theory
,
perfect
in
every
part
and
bristle
with
proof
,
he
find
that
a
slight
hitch
at
the
beginning
destroy
it
all
.
<EOS>
neither
the
pursuer
nor
pursue
have
cross
the
spot
where
he
be
so
certain
he
would
discover
their
footprint
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
disappointment
to
Deerfoot
,
who
stand
several
minute
debate
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
require
considerable
time
to
return
point
where
he
separate
from
the
boy
follow
them
thence
,
beside
place
him
well
to
the
rear
of
the
red
man
from
whom
the
harm
be
dread
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
fact
which
disturb
Deerfoot
,
but
there
seem
no
other
course
open
.
<EOS>
He
could
easily
speculate
as
to
the
route
by
which
to
head
off
the
warrior
,
but
the
mistake
just
make
warn
him
that
he
have
no
time
guess
of
that
character
.
<EOS>
clearly
the
only
thing
to
do
be
to
follow
the
course
name
,
and
with
his
usual
promptitude
,
he
move
through
the
wood
toward
the
point
where
he
be
more
than
likely
to
come
into
collision
with
the
large
party
of
Shawanoes
.
<EOS>
He
turn
aside
from
his
own
trail
,
as
he
invariably
do
under
circumstance
,
but
have
not
go
far
when
he
find
that
which
be
lose
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
halt
and
look
at
the
ground
with
a
grim
smile
,
for
he
see
the
print
of
the
horse
's
hoof
,
the
track
make
by
Jack
and
Otto
,
and
the
light
impression
of
two
pain
of
moccasin
.
<EOS>
have
catch
sight
of
the
warrior
not
long
previous
,
he
know
they
be
at
no
great
distance
.
<EOS>
They
be
walk
at
such
a
leisurely
pace
that
unless
it
be
increase
,
they
be
not
likely
to
overtake
the
unconscious
fugitive
before
they
halt
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
wheel
and
hurried
along
the
trail
,
with
the
loping
,
noiseless
trot
which
could
be
maintain
without
distress
from
rise
of
morn
till
set
of
sun
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
scrutinize
the
earth
directly
at
his
foot
,
but
glance
several
rod
in
front
.
<EOS>
He
could
readily
detect
the
trail
that
far
,
and
be
thus
enable
to
keep
keen
watch
of
his
surrounding
,
without
retard
his
own
gait
.
<EOS>
He
occasionally
fling
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
but
he
be
well
satisfied
that
none
of
the
large
party
be
after
him
:
they
have
become
impressed
with
the
fact
that
it
would
not
pay
.
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
<EOS>
and
he
leap
lightly
over
a
small
stream
,
which
cross
his
path
.
<EOS>
He
pause
long
enough
to
learn
that
the
home
have
stop
to
drink
,
do
so
with
some
difficulty
,
for
the
water
be
so
shallow
that
his
lip
must
have
stir
the
mud
on
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
the
boy
do
not
halt
,
but
one
of
the
warrior
have
get
down
on
his
knee
and
hand
,
the
latter
spread
apart
like
the
fore
leg
of
a
camelopard
,
as
to
touch
his
dusky
lip
to
the
water
,
of
which
he
drink
his
fill
.
<EOS>
all
this
Deerfoot
note
,
with
only
a
few
moment
'
pause
,
then
he
be
off
again
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
go
only
a
little
way
,
when
he
observe
other
fact
that
be
more
disquieting
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoes
have
change
pace
similar
to
his
own
,
and
beyond
question
be
gain
upon
the
boy
,
who
could
not
know
peril
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
be
convince
that
the
red
man
have
hasten
through
fear
of
lose
the
trail
in
the
come
darkness
.
<EOS>
It
follow
,
therefore
,
that
he
himself
must
advance
faster
or
lose
the
scent
.
<EOS>
while
able
to
follow
the
track
of
a
horse
,
entirely
by
the
sense
of
feeling
,
the
progress
must
necessarily
be
too
slow
to
be
effective
under
circumstance
like
those
which
now
confront
him
.
<EOS>
the
youth
make
a
tremendous
bound
and
strike
a
gait
which
render
it
unnecessary
to
look
behind
him

equal
his
speed

He
watch
only
the

through
which
he
be
hurry
with
a
velocity
that
raise
a
gale
about
his
ear
and
keep
him
dodge
and
duck
his
head
to
avoid
unpleasant
consequence

<EOS>
all
at
once
,
he
leap
sideways
behind
the
near
large
tree
,
set
down
his
rifle
and
bow
and
draw
his
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
He
have
discover
through
the
gathering
twilight
one
of
the
Shawanoes
return
over
the
trail
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fortunate
accident
which
prevent
him
detect
his
pursuer
,
since
he
be
on
the
watch
against
that
very
danger
,
but
Deerfoot
be
an
instant
quicker
,
and
await
him
as
grimly
as
he
confront
the
two
warrior
who
follow
him
to
the
base
of
the
hill
,
where
one
be
pierce
by
his

at
first

come
back

have
be
summon
thither
perhaps
by
some
signal
from
the
large
party

he
see
there
be
only
one
.
<EOS>
the
youth
could
have
pick
him
off
without
difficulty
,
but
he
be
too
chivalrous
to
do
so
,
inasmuch
as
the
red
man
be
actually
retreat
instead
of
advance

not

his
long

in
his
right
band
,

a
glimpse
be
obtain
of
his
blanket
roll
and
strap
like

He
hold
his

well
forward
,
his
restless

scan
the
wood
as
it
open
before
him

evidently
with
no

of
the
danger

really
menace
him

all
at

the

softly
from

check
himself
as
abruptly

Deerfoot
be
so
close
that
the

could
have
touch
him
with
his
extended
bow

<EOS>
the
warrior
,
old
enough
to
be
the
father
of
the

see
that
he
be
helpless

<EOS>
He
be
without
the
power
to
raise
a
finger
to
save
himself
,
even
though
he
hold
a
loaded
rifle
in

the

in
his

his

the

tomahawk
would
have
leave
the
grasp
of
Deerfoot
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning

the
skull
of
his
foe
would
have
be
cleave

“He

“Deerfoot

it
be

ask

to
accept
the

of

to
keep

He

one
landmark

so
to
speak
,
and
that
be
the
moon

then
well
up
in

<EOS>
He
locate
the
luminary
with
such
exactness

that
he
know
it
would
be
directly
over
his
right
shoulder

he
arrive
at
a
point
precisely
opposite
his

,
as

in

I
always
like
to
see
the
moon

it
can
not

have
tell
me
many
a

She
say

she

a

watch

chide
him

too

reminiscence

He
be

”He

<EOS>
aim
be
to
halt
some
twenty

thirty
rod
beyond

then
,
when
assure
he
have
go
far
enough

he
would
walk
directly

“I

do
so

a
misgiving

the
decisive
moment
be
at

for
if
we
fail
it
will
end
the
business

<EOS>
if
he
go
home
without
the
colt
,
his
father
will
beat
him

more
than
likely
will
drive
him
into
the
wood
and
forbid
him
to
come
back
till
he
bring
the
horse
with
him

He
be
such
a
hard

miserly
old

there

an
abundance
of
grass

the
identical
colt
which
run
away
the
day
before

<EOS>
saddle
and
bridle
be
still
in
place
,
though
even
the
moonlight
be
sufficient
to
show
they
have
suffer
much
from
the
journey
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
evidently
be
suspicious
that
something
be
amiss
.
<EOS>
He
be
crop
the
grass
,
when
the
sound
of
Jack
's
footstep
alarm
him
.
<EOS>
He
stand
with
his
head
up
,
the
grass
drip
like
water
from
his
mouth
,
while
he
listen
for
the
cause
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
be
well
aware
of
the
difficulty
that
face
him
when
on
the
very
threshold
of
success
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
close
to
the
animal
,
he
be
not
yet
secure
.
<EOS>
“ah
!
<EOS>
if
Deerfoot
be
here
,
"
sigh
the
boy
,
"
then
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
the
result
,
for
he
would
dart
forward
and
catch
him
.
<EOS>
if
the
horse
want
to
run
away
,
he
would
let
him
do
it
,
and
then
the
Shawanoe
would
chase
him
down
,
just
as
easily
as
he
would
me
or
Otto
;
but
it
be
go
to
be
hard
work
for
me
.
<EOS>
”It
be
difficult
to
decide
on
the
good
course
of
procedure
.
<EOS>
the
sagacious
creature
would
not
only
be
quick
to
recognize
Jack
,
but
equally
quick
to
understand
his
purpose
in
approach
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
much
to
expect
him
to
submit
quietly
to
recapture
.
<EOS>
Jack
softly
pluck
a
handful
of
grass
,
and
,
step
out
from
the
cover
of
the
wood
begin
move
gently
toward
the
colt
.
<EOS>
the
latter
turn
his
head
and
utter
a
sniff
of
inquiry
,
at
the
same
time
show
an
inclination
to
whirl
about
and
gallop
off
.
<EOS>
the
boy
stand
still
and
,
hold
out
the
grass
,
deftly
manipulate
it
so
that
a
part
drop
loosely
to
the
ground
:
this
insure
its
notice
by
his
victim
.
<EOS>
Jack
also
address
him
in
his
most
soothing
tone
.
<EOS>
He
call
him
all
the
pet
name
at
his
command
,
and
,
as
the
steed
still
hold
his
ground
,
the
youth
resume
his
stealthy
advance
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
's
heart
throb
with
hope
.
<EOS>
the
animal
throw
his
head
higher
,
snuff
louder
,
and
manifestly
be
hesitate
whether
to
permit
a
close
approach
before
flee
,
or
whether
to
turn
his
face
at
once
from
temptation
.
<EOS>
“a
<EOS>
few
step
more
<EOS>
and
he
be
mine
,
"
<EOS>
be
the
thought
of
Jack
,
who
repeat
the
pet
name
with
great
ardor
,
intersperse
them
with
a
variation
of
clucking
and
chirping
that
would
have
charm
a
prattle
baby
.
<EOS>
He
increase
his
pace
,
for
he
be
almost
within
reach
,
while
the
beast
snort
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
Jack
drop
the
gun
in
his
other
hand
,
and
make
a
desperate
plunge
,
mean
to
grasp
the
forelock
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
he
succeed
,
for
he
feel
the
coarse
,
cool
hair
as
it
be
sweep
through
his
finger
by
the
flirt
of
the
animal
's
head
.
<EOS>
Jack
miss
success
,
by
what
may
be
truly
say
to
have
be
a
hair
's
breadth
.
<EOS>
“whoa
!
<EOS>
confound
you!”This
command
<EOS>
be
utter
in
a
very
different
tone
from
that
in
which
he
have
be
address
the
colt
a
minute
before
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
soothing
in
it
,
and
the
animal
show
his
contempt
by
whirl
about
,
kick
up
his
heel
and
dash
into
the
wood
.
<EOS>
Jack
snatch
his
gun
from
the
ground
and
bound
after
him
at
the
imminent
risk
of
break
his
neck
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
far
from
Otto
and
his
captor
to
attract
attention
,
but
the
noise
may
have
reach
the
ear
of
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
the
angered
pursuer
do
not
coax
or
order
the
colt
,
for
what
he
have
do
in
that
line
be
sufficient
to
show
the
effort
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
He
listen
:
the
animal
be
still
go
at
a
rate
which
show
he
believe
the
danger
be
at
his
heel
.
<EOS>
the
sound
he
make
,
while
gallop
over
the
leave
and
through
the
bush
,
grow
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
die
out
altogether
.
<EOS>
“i
suppose
he
will
keep
it
up
for
several
hour

<EOS>
if
he
face
toward
the

he

reach
it
to

but
if
he
veer
to
the
right

Otto
may
as
well
give
up
the
job

<EOS>
”Jack
be
keenly
disappointed
,
for
he
have
be
confident
of
success
,
and
now
he
be
force
to
admit
there
be
scarcely
a
hope
of
ever
see
the
colt
again
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
be
a
bad
go

"
he
say
,
turn
about
and
move
toward
the
clearing
,
where
he
have
leave
his
friend
;
"
we
will
keep
up
the
hunt
to

morrow
,
but
if
he
be
not
catch
before
sundown
,
I
shall
insist
that
we
go
home

<EOS>
Mother

anxious

see
me

he
add
,
in
a
soft
voice

"
<EOS>
but
no
more
than
I
be
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
week
since
we
part
,
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
her
while
I
be
loiter
by
the
way
,
I
can
never
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
do
not
reflect
that
he
be
expose
to
tenfold
more
harm
than
his
parent
.
<EOS>
He
reproach
himself
that
he
have
tarry
in
Coatesville
until
Otto
come
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
ready
and
wait
several
day
,
during
which
he
could
have
make
the
journey
on
foot
,
without
the
guidance
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
too
late
now
for
regret
,
and
he
try
to
take
matter
philosophically
.
<EOS>
the
young
Kentuckian
make
certain
he
be
steadily
pursue
the
right
course
,
and
,
when
he
think
he
have
advance
far
enough
,
he

the
whistle
agree
upon
.
<EOS>
of
course
no

as
the

know

the
young
Teuton
for
whom
the

<EOS>
in

without

Jack

forward

<EOS>
chapter
xxviii
.
<EOS>
the
eavesdroppernaturally
the
first
impression
of
Jack
Carleton
,
on
see
the
light
,
be
that
it
proceed
from
the
fire
kindle
by
Otto
.
<EOS>
It
strike
him
as
curious
that
he
should
do
so
before
be
could
be
certain
the
horse
be
capture
;
but
,
in
accordance
with
his
training
,
Jack
take
nothing
for
grant
.
<EOS>
a
few
guard
step
,
and
he
discover
the
truth
;
the
light
be
much
close
than
he
suspect
,
and
come
through
a
slight
rent
in
the
side
of
an
indian
wigwam
.
<EOS>
the
young
Kentuckian
be
astounded
,
for
he
have
never
dream
of
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
he
must
be
on
the
confine
of
an
indian
village
,
and
make
a
further
investigation
;
but
it
do
not
take
long
to
learn
that
the
lodge
stand
alone
in
the
great
forest
.
<EOS>
“I
suppose
some
chieftain
or
warrior
have
quarrel
with
his
people
and
live
by
himself
,
"
be
the
remarkably
accurate
guess
of
the
boy
;
"
I
do
not
know
how
he
feel
toward
white
folk
,
but
I
will
take
a
little
further
look
and
then
hunt
up
Otto
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
could
not
fail
to
note
that
the
lodge
stand
close
to
the
clearing
where
he
have
agree
to
meet
his
friend
,
and
he
be
unable
to
free
himself
of
a
dread
,
while
steal
forward
for
the
purpose
of
peep
through
the
rent
in
the
side
of
the
aboriginal
structure
.
<EOS>
Otto
must
have
see
the
wigwam
before
reach
it
,
though
the
proprietor
may
have
be
quick
in
detect
the
approach
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
fully
sensible
of
the
care
require
,
Jack
advance
slowly
,
without
noise
,
feel
every
inch
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
be
able
to
bend
forward
and
peep
through
the
slight
opening
,
which
first
tell
him
of
the
location
of
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
It
require
some
delicate
maneuvering
to
gain
a
good
view
of
the
interior
,
and
it
nee
not
be
say
that
the
result
be
of
the
most
interesting
nature
.
<EOS>
His
eye
,
or
rather
eye
(
inasmuch
as
he
use
only
one
)
,
first
rest
on
the
dusky
baby
,
that
have
manage
to
kick
off
the
blanket
,
and
be
fiercely
tug
at
the
piece
of
cooked
venison
which
his
dusky
mother
bad
toss
him
.
<EOS>
He
hold
it
between
his
scant
tooth
,
grasp
it
with
his
chubby
hand
,
while
his
foot
beat
the
air
,
occasionally
catch
under
his
chin
,
as
though
he
be
use
hand
and
foot
to
force
the
meat
apart
.
<EOS>
He
work
his
leg
with
such
a
vigor
that
at
time
he
seem
in
danger
of
make
a
back
somersault
and
bumping
through
the
side
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
under
other
circumstance
Jack
Carleton
would
have
laugh
outright
at
the
comical
figure
of
the
bright
-
eyed
infant
;
but
the
sight
of
Otto
Relstaub
check
all
such
feeling
,
and
deepen
the
alarm
which
come
with
the
first
sight
of
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
Jack
be
much
close
to
his
friend
than
he
be
to
any
of
the
other
three
figure
.
<EOS>
no
more
than
two
foot
separate
the
boy
,
and
in
peer
into
the
lodge
,
the
eavesdropper
look
directly
over
the
head
and
shoulder
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
the
familiar
peaked
hat
,
which
have
not
be
remove
,
the
rather
long
,
curl
hair
,
the
round
,
rosy
check
,
broad
shoulder
,
the
tip
of
the
pug
nose
,
the
plump
chin
,
the
foot
,
and
the
arm
rest
idly
on
the
draw
-
up
knee
—
all
these
make
the
young
german
look
like
an
exaggerated
fairy
,
that
have
drop
in
on
some
superstitious
mortal
and
be
regale
them
with
tale
of
wonderland

<EOS>
but
Otto
be
not

to

he
be
look
from
one
to
the
other
,
sometimes
smile
at
the
snuffing
,
kicking
,
clawing
infant
,
and
then
assume
an
anxious
expression
,
when
his
eye
rest
on
the
face
of
the
other
who
share
the
lodge
with
him
.
<EOS>

in
and
exhale
the
vapor
from

pipe

with
the
deliberate
enjoyment
of
an
old
smoker

<EOS>
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
,
she
stare
fixedly
at
Otto

who
must
have
be

by
her
persistency

his
immense
mouth

the
smoke
with
his
double
tongue

send
forth

in
any
direction
he

<EOS>
look
up
at
the
opening
in
the
top
of
the
lodge
,
he
start
a
regular
procession
of
blue
circle
,
twist
inward
and
slowly
expand
as
they
climb
toward
the
fresh
air
,
where
they
be
suddenly
catch
and
whirl
into
nothingness

<EOS>
Jack
have
the
good
view
of
the
chieftain
he
could
wish
,
and
fearful
of
be
detect
,
draw
his
head
back
a
few
inch
so
as
to
be
in
entire
darkness
,
and
study
the
ugly
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
observe
the
small
,
piggish
eye
far
apart
,
the
big
cheek
bone
,
the
disfigure
nose
,
the
enormous
mouth
,
the
slouchy
,
untidy
dress
,
and
even
the
half
dozen
straggle
hair
that
sprout
here
and
there
over
his
massive
chin
.
<EOS>
He
notice
the
flit
glance
of
the
black
eye
,
and
know
that
the
unattractive
Indian
have
,
in
some
way
or
other
,
make
a
prisoner
of
Otto
Relstaub
,
whose
rifle
be
miss
.
<EOS>
stand
on
the
outside
with
his
load
gun
in
hand
,
the
young
Kentuckian
could
have
do
as
he
please
with
the
red
man
,
who
have
no
suspicion
of
danger
;
but
the
thought
of
shoot
him
be
unspeakably
shocking
to
Jack
,
who
could
not
have
be
persuade
to
the
step
unless
force
to
do
so
,
in
order
to
save
the
life
of
Otto
or
himself
.
<EOS>
Cruel
indeed
must
any
one
be
who
could
look
on
the
picture
of
domestic
happiness
,
the
stolid
father
,
the
contented
mother
,
and
the
lusty
youngster
,
without
feel
his
heart
stir
by
that
deep
,
inborn
sympathy
which
make
the
whole
world
akin
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
be
not
a
Shawanoe
or
Miami
,
"
be
the
conclusion
of
Jack
,
after
a
careful
study
of
the
warrior
's
face
and
general
appearance
;
"
I
have
never
see
an
osage
,
but
have
hear
much
of
them
,
and
I
be
quite
sure
he
be
one
.
<EOS>
if
that
be
so
,
he
be
not
as
fierce
as
his
race
on
the
other
side
the
Mississippi
,
and
I
think
we
can
get
Otto
out
of
there
without
harm
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
go
to
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
we
must
keep
on
good
term
with
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
Helloa
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
old
fellow
go
to
do?”jack
notice
that
the
head
of
the
family
have
stop
glance
from
one
part
of
the
lodge
to
another
,
and
be
look
steadily
at
Otto
,
as
if
he
meditate
some
design
against
him
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
do
.
<EOS>
draw
in
an
enormous
quantity
of
smoke
,
he
remove
the
stem
from
his
leathern
lip
,
contract
them
into
another
o
,
and
suddenly
shoot
out
a
vapory
ring
,
follow
instantly
by
a
second
,
third
and
fourth
,
and
then
by
so
many
that
they
stumble
over
each
other
's
heel
,
as
may
be
say
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
mouth
of
Wish

a

seem
to
have
become
a
mitrailleue
for
the
moment
,
that
send
a
continuous
volley
across
the
wigwam

<EOS>
when
the
bombardment
open

Otto
be
look
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge

from

which

vapor
toward

that
seem
to
exert
a
great
power
as

distance
from

<EOS>
when
within

inch
of

the
smoke
fly
apart

spin
around

whisk
out

“Donderation

in

he
look
at
the
discomfited

and

.
<EOS>
the
smile
be
the

on
which

have
ever
look

He
see
the
corner
of

mouth
move
back
on

cheek
until
it
seem
they
must
touch

<EOS>
perhaps
the

so
seldom
that
the

serve
to
bring
up
the

the

once
more
toward

<EOS>
while
this
little
episode
be
go
on
,
the
squaw
,
with
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
her
elbow
on
her
knee
,
continue
to
stare
at
Otto
;
but
she
show
no
disposition
to
smile
even
in
the
slight
degree
.
<EOS>
in
her
the
element
of
mirth
appear
to
be
totally
lacking
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
probable
that
she
have
not
acquire
the
art
of
eject
the
circle
of
smoke
,
or
she
would
have
follow
up
the
exhibition
of
her
husband
with
a
similar
one
,
inspire
thereto
by
the
innate
ugliness
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
the
incident
describe
do
much
to
dissipate
the
alarm
of
Jack
Carleton
for
his
friend
.
<EOS>
the
overwhelming
smile
on
the
countenance
of
the
chieftain
make
it
attractive
,
for
it
be
free
from
the
disfigurement
of
hate
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
he
be
an
Osage
,
with
his
wife
and
little
one
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
be
a
pleasant
neighbor
,
but
he
would
not
dare
to
live
away
from
his
tribe
,
if
he
be
as
cruel
as
the
Shawanoes
or
Hurons
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
settler
would
shoot
him
and
his
squaw
and
papoose
.
<EOS>
”this
<EOS>
theory
be
reasonable
,
but
from
the
nature
of
the
case
it
could
not
be
complete
in
the
assurance
it
bring
to
the
mind
of
the
young
Kentuckian
,
inasmuch
as
it
fail
to
explain
several
alarming
fact
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Otto
,
manifestly
,
be
a
prisoner
in
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
gun
with
which
to
defend
himself
,
nor
could
the
guard
peeping
of
the
eavesdropper
discover
the
weapon
within
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
in
what
manner
the
German
have
fall
into
the
power
of
the
Osage
be
beyond
conjecture
,
nor
could
Jack
guess
the
ultimate
intention
of
the
captor
.
<EOS>
“I
have
my
load
gun
,
"
be
the
thought
of
the
youth
,
"
and
I
ought
to
be
able
to
get
Otto
out
of
this
scrape
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sorry
,
indeed
,
to
harm
any
one
in
the
wigwam
,
and
so
long
as
it
be
possible
to
avoid
it
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
if
the
warrior
receive
injury
it
will
be
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
such
time
,
the
most
curious
fancy
often
take
possession
of
a
person
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
have
convince
himself
that
the
Indian
,
wigwam
be
the
only
one
in
the
neighborhood
;
but
he
have
scarcely
decide
what
his
course
should
be
,
when
he
begin
to
fear
he
have
make
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
seem
unlikely
that
a
single
Osage
should
dwell
apart
from
his
tribe
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
“There
must
be
other
lodge
near
me
,
"
he
think
,
step
softly
back
and
peer
around
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
It
matter
not
that
he
see
no
light
from
any
of
them
,
for
he
reason
that
they
may
be
hide
by
the
intervene
tree
.
<EOS>
so
strong
be
the
feeling
,
that
he
move
further
off
and
repeat
the
very
reconnaissance
make
a
short
time
previous
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
do
so
,
have
he
not
know
that
Otto
be
in
no
immediate
danger
from
his
captor
.
<EOS>
have
the
latter
offer
him
harm
,
the
struggle
would
have
be
hear
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
and
Jack
would
have
rush
to
the
relief
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
finally
,
the
eavesdropper
become
satisfied
that
whatever
the
issue
of
the
strange
situation
,
he
have
<EOS>
but
the
single
family
to
face
.
<EOS>
then
he
be
distress
by
the
doubt
as
to
what
the
squaw
would
do
,
it
he
carry
out
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
,
know
that
the
indian
woman
be
as
brave
,
and
frequently
more
cruel
,
toward
their
captive
than
be
the
warrior
themselves
.
<EOS>
if
the
one
before
him
become
violent
,
Jack
would
be
likely
to
find
he
have
undertake
a
task
beyond
his
power
.
<EOS>
His
determination
be
to
walk
directly
into
the
lodge
and
act
as
if
he
believe
the
occupant
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
stride
forward
toward
the
entrance
,
purposely
kick
the
leave
with
his
foot
;
and
it
be
that
noise
which
apprise
those
within
of
his
approach
.

to
the

which
close
the
entrance
to
the
wigwam

fling
it
aside

and
,
stoop
slightly
,

<EOS>
look
into
the
face
of
Wish

,
he
make
a
half
military
salute
and
,
straighten
up
,
call
out:“How
<EOS>
do
you
do
,
brother?”the
etiquette
of
the
visitor
require
him
to
advance
and
offer
his
hand
,
but
he
be
afraid
to
do
so
while
in
doubt
as
to
the
sentiment
of
the
chief
.
<EOS>
the
young
Kentuckian
recall
an
instance
somewhat
similar
to
the
present
,
wherein
a
Huron
warrior
,
grasp
the
hand
of
the
white
man
who
offer
it
,
suddenly
draw
him
forward
and
plunge
his
hunting
-
knife
into
his
side
.
<EOS>
the
unexpected
visit
of
Jack
produce
a
sensation
amount
,
for
the
moment
,
almost
to
consternation
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
the
squaw
show
genuine
surprise
.
<EOS>
snap
the
pipe
from
her
mouth
,
she
throw
up
her
head
with
a
grunt
,
and
stare
at
the
athletic
youth
.
<EOS>
the
kick
baby
on
the
hearth
appear
to
understand
that
something
unusual
be
go
on
,
and
hold
arm
and
leg
still
,
while
he
stare
,
with
his
round
black
eye
,
toward
the
figure
at
the
other
end
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
man
-
not
-
afraid
-
of
-
thunder
turn
his
head
,
hold
his
pipe
in
hand
,
and
look
inquiringly
at
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
show
no
sign
of
fear
,
but
,
manifestly
,
he
be
astonish
.
<EOS>
His
fragmentary
conversation
with
the
other
boy
have
give
him
no
cause
to
look
for
such
a
call
,
though
he
see
at
a
glance
that
the
two
be
friend
.
<EOS>
Otto

beam
with
delight
.
<EOS>
with
an
expanse
of
smile
second
only
to
that
of
which
the
sachem
be
capable
,
he
rise
partly
to
his
foot
and
,
look
at
Jack
,
call
out:“Mine
gracious
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
I
do
not
look
for
noding
of
you
pefore
,
as
dot
ish—”“Hold
on

"
<EOS>
interpose
the
lad
at
the
door
,
with
a
laugh
and
wave
of
the
hand
,
"
sit
down
and
compose
yourself
till
you
can
talk
straighter
than
that
.
<EOS>
”“I
dink
I
do
—
yaw
,
"
mutter
the
happy
fellow
,
willing
to
do
anything
suggest
by
his
companion
;
"
but
come
in
and
sot
down
.
<EOS>
”while
<EOS>
address
Otto
,
Jack
keep
his
eye
on
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
for
it
may
be
say
he
be
the
key
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
if
he
show
hostility
,
trouble
be
sure
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Jack
half
expect
to
see
him
make
a
leap
for
his
bow
or
rifle
,
or
attempt
to
draw
his
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
think
the
boy
,
"
I
will
raise
my
gun
first
,
and
he
will
understand
what
that
mean
.
<EOS>
”but
<EOS>
the
look
and
manner
of
the
host
(
if
such
he
may
be
call
)
be
neither
hostile
nor
friendly
;
they
be
indifferent
,
as
though
the
whole
business
possess
no
interest
to
him
.
<EOS>
after
his
first
surprised
stare
,
he
swing
his
head
back
to
its
former
position
and
slowly
smoke
his
pipe
as
before
.
<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
make
up
his
mind
on
the
moment
that
his
true
course
be
to
carry
out
his
first
idea
that
be
,
to
act
as
though
there
be
no
doubt
of
the
friendship
of
the
Osage
.
<EOS>
step
to
the
left
,
he
set
his
gun
on
the
ground
with
the
muzzle
lean
against
the
side
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
no
more
expressive
sign
of
comity
could
have
be
give
than
this
simple
act
.
<EOS>
He
then
advance
to
the
beefy
,
stolid
chieftain
,
to
whom
he
offer
his
hand
,
repeat
the
words:“How
<EOS>
do
you
do
,
brother?”wish
<EOS>
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
take
the
finger
in
his
own
immense
palm
,
and
give
them
a
moderate
pressure
.
<EOS>
though
it
may
have
be
call
a
warm
salute
,
it
send
a
shiver
through
the
youth
,
who
unconsciously
brace
himself
against
any
sudden
pull
of
the
savage
,
his
other
hand
,
at
the
same
time
,
vaguely
seek
the
handle
of
his
knife
.
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
thought
or
intention
may
have
stir
the
massive
chieftain
,
they
give
no
evidence
of
their
nature
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
at
the
boy
,
and
,
as
he
slightly
wabble
the
hand
within
his
own
<EOS>
,
said:“How
do
,
brudder?”Jack
then
turn
about
and
greet
Otto
,
who
could
scarcely
contain
himself
.
<EOS>
the
movement
,
it
will
be
notice
,
place
the
back
of
the
former
toward
the
chief
,
and
he
be
conscious
of
another
chill
run
up
and
down
his
spine
;
for
no
well
opportunity
could
be
give
the
Indian
to
strike
one
of
those
treacherous
,
lightning
-
like
blow
peculiar
to
the
savage
race
.
<EOS>
“Keep
<EOS>
your
eye
on
him
,
"
say
Jack
,
in
an
undertone
,
while
shake
the
hand
of
Otto
,
and
both
be
talk
loud
and
effusively
.
<EOS>
Otto
nod
his
head
and
wink
,
to
signify
he
catch
on
,
and
do
not
check
,
for
a
single
moment
,
his
rattle
flow
of
talk
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
in
the
most
natural
manner
,
shift
his
position
to
one
side
,
so
he
be
able
to
look
upon
every
one
in
the
wigwam
without
the
appearance
of
any
special
object
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
great
point
with
the
caller
be
to
secure
the
good
-
will
of
the
savage
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
shrewd
on
their
part
,
but
any
boy
,
no
matter
what
his
age
,
know
that
the
sure
way
to
win
the
friendship
of
a
household
be
to
magnify
the
importance
of
the
baby
.
<EOS>
the
thought
occur
to
Otto
long
before
,
and
more
than
once
he
explore
his
garment
in
search
of
some
present
for
the
youngster
;
but
he
possess
nothing
that
would
answer
.
<EOS>
His
pocket
be
empty
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
coin
,
bright
medal
,
button
,
or
plaything
of
any
sort
likely
to
attract
the
eye
of
the
aboriginal
american
infant
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
hand
his
hunting
-
knife
to
him
,
but
more
than
likely
,
in
his
blind
striking
and
kick
,
he
would
gouge
out
an
eye
or
attempt
to
scalp
himself
,
and
then
the
mother
would
turn
upon
the
donor
in
her
wrath
.
<EOS>
Otto
consider
the
project
of
borrow
the
tomahawk
of
the
chief
and
pass
it
over
to
the
heir
,
but
fear
he
would
knock
out
his
own
brain
or
do
something
desperate
,
by
which
retribution
would
be
visit
on
the
head
of
Otto
.
<EOS>
but
Jack
Carleton
be
more
fortunate
,
for
in
the
pocket
of
his
trouser
<EOS>
be
an
English
shilling
,
wear
smooth
and
shine
with
the
friction
to
which
it
have
be
long
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
the
thing
to
catch
the
eye
of
any
baby
,
no
matter
what
its
nativity
,
and
he
step
hastily
forward
and
hand
it
to
the
one
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
movement
interest
the
parent
scarcely
less
than
the
child
.
<EOS>
They
watch
Jack
closely
.
<EOS>
the
little
fellow
snatch
the
bright
coin
in
his
snuffling
,
awkward
fashion
,
and
,
when
it
be
clutch
in
his
finger
,
make
a
furious
shove
,
intend
to
drive
it
into
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
“hold
on
,
"
call
Jack
,
in
alarm
;
"
I
do
not
give
it
to
you
to
eat
;
I
do
not
believe
you
can
digest
it
.
<EOS>
”just
<EOS>
then
the
little
fellow
begin
to
kick
,
cough
,
and
fle
himself
harder
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
mother
spring
forward
with
an
exclamation
in
her
native
tongue
,
and
,
catch
her
baby
in
her
arm
,
begin
manipulate
him
in
the
most
original
fashion
.
<EOS>
stand
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
wigwam
,
she
invert
him
,
and
,
hold
him
by
the
heel
,
work
him
up
and
down
,
as
though
he
be
the
dasher
of
a
chum
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
she
do
not
do
dot
a
leedle
<EOS>
hard
his
head
vill
bounce
off
,
"
remark
Otto
.
<EOS>
the
shilling
fly
from
the
throat
of
the
baby
,
and
Jack
,
think
it
have
do
enough
harm
,
scoop
over
to
pick
it
up
;
but
,
before
he
could
lay
hand
on
it
,
the
mother
snatch
it
from
the
ground
and
shove
it
into
one
of
the
capacious
receptacle
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>

this

His

to

with

look

so
motionless

“So

when
I

I

you
be
after
food

<EOS>
I
be
hungry

I
think
the
good
thing
we
can
do
be
to
leave
the
lodge

<EOS>
”“vy
<EOS>
not

strike
me
that

that
I
take

something
extraordinary

on
in

although
the

in

lazy
attitude

yet
his
sense
be
on
the
alert
and
some
sort
of
telegraphy
be
pass
between
him

his
wife

<EOS>
both
continue
smoke
their
pipe
and
do

they

not

so
,
but
,
singular
as
it
may
seem
,
be
send
message
mainly
by
mean
of
the
smoke
issue
from
their
dusky
lip
.
<EOS>
It
be
puff
forth
,
in
every
variety
of
manner
,
sometimes
with
little
short
jet
,
then
with
long
one
,
then
from
one
corner
of
the
mouth
and
again
from
the
other
,
all
be
accompany
by
a
contortion
of
the
flexible
lip
which
doubtless
suggest
some
of
the
word
in
the
mind
of
the
two

<EOS>
“That
be
very
strange

Jack
,
in
an
undertone
,
after

performance

”husband
<EOS>

be
quick
to
observe
they
be
under
scrutiny

they
continue
the
curious
interchange
of
thought

some
time
longer

<EOS>
by
and
by
they
cease
and
seem

nothing

CHAPTER
XXX
.
<EOS>
an
UNWELCOME
visitorboth
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
be
disturb
by
the
singular
behavior
of
the
squaw
and
chief
.
<EOS>
“They're
talk
about
something
outdoors
,
"
whisper
Jack
;
"
keep
quiet
and
listen
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
faint
rustling
of
the
leave
,
the
gentle
breathing
of
the
sleeping
infant
,
and
the
soft
purring
of
the
fire
(
cause
by
<EOS>
the
sudden
flaring
up
of
one
of
the
brand
)
,
be
the
only
sound
that
come
to
their
ear
.
<EOS>
wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
hold
the
stem
of
his
pipe
between
his
lip
,
without
eject
any
smoke
,
while
his
eye
be
fix
on
the
ground
in
front
of
his
foot
,
with
that
absent
expression
which
show
he
be
listen
intently
to
something
not
visible
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
the
attitude
of
the
wife
be
similar
,
except
that
she
look
steadily
in
the
face
of
Jack
Carleton
,
as
though
seek
to
read
his
thought
.
<EOS>
hark
!
<EOS>
both
the
boy
catch
a
stirring
of
the
leave
,
precisely
as
if
make
by
the
foot
of
an
animal
prowling
around
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
“Sh
!
"
warn
Jack
;
"
it
be
a
man
or
<EOS>
beast!”the
word
have
no
more
than
leave
his
lip
,
when
the
flap
deerskin
be
silently
draw
backward
and
an
indian
warrior
enter
.
<EOS>
He
be
powerful
and
well
form
in
his
war
paint
,
and
with
his
long
rifle
in
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
blanket
throw
over
his
shoulder
,
but
he
be
fully
dress
in
other
respect
,
with
knife
and
tomahawk
thrust
in
the
girdle
around
his
waist
.
<EOS>
the
first
glance
show
that
he
not
only
belong
to
the
Shawanoe
tribe
,
but
he
be
one
of
the
most
dreaded
member
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
both
Otto
and
Jack
have
see
him
before
,
his
forehead
and
cheek
be
so
curiously
mark
as
to
identify
him
wherever
no
one
else
be
similarly
ornament
.
<EOS>
when
the
boy
be
make
their
desperate
run
for
the
shelter
of
the
log
on
the
other
side
,
of
the
Mississippi
,
Otto
throw
back
an
affrighted
look
,
which
give
him
such
a
vivid
picture
of
that
particular
savage
that
he
feel
the
memory
would
remain
with
him
through
life
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
after
,
as
my
reader
will
recall
,
Jack
deliberately
hold
fast
to
the
upper
edge
of
the
rude
fort
and
look
over
upon
the
fierce
warrior
outside
.
<EOS>
the
one
who
particularly
impress
him
be
the
Shawanoe
with
the
hideously
paint
countenance
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
same
Indian
that
fling
the
bear
skin
about
his
shoulder
and
,
creep
up
the
inclined
tree
trunk
,
survey
the
astonished
youth
below
,
and
it
be
he
who
now
enter
the
lodge
of
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
confront
the
inmate
.
<EOS>
the
truth
flash
upon
the
boy
:
he
be
one
of
a
party
that
have
follow
them
across
the
Mississippi
,
and
have
trace
them
to
this
lodge
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
the
youth
should
believe
that
other
be
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
Otto
have
leave
his
gun
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
some
distance
away
,
while
the
weapon
of
Jack
stand
near
the
entrance
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
the
instant
the
Shawanoe
step
inside
,
his
eye
rest
on
it
,
and
,
as
if
divine
the
truth
,
he
extend
his
hand
and
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
the
act
give
him
two
gun
,
while
neither
of
the
boy
possess
a
fire
-
arm
.
<EOS>
have
perform
this
clever
exploit
,
the
Shawanoe
,
still
stand
erect
,
just
within
the
lodge
,
turn
to
the
chief
and
address
him
in
what
may
be
term
a
mixture
of
the
Shawanoe
and
Osage
tongue
.
<EOS>
He
pay
no
attention
to
the
squaw
at
the
other
end
of
the
wigwam
,
for
to
an
American
Indian
the
native
woman
be
of
little
account
under
any
circumstance
.
<EOS>
nor
do
his
face
indicate
that
he
be
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
boy
,
who
look
at
him
with
dismay
;
but
it
be
morally
certain
that
the
conversation
which
open
immediately
relate
almost
solely
to
them
.
<EOS>
“My
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
say
Jack
,
when
able
to
recover
himself
,
"
this
be
bad
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
never
dream
of
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
speak
very
guardedly
,
with
his
head
close
to
his
friend
's
though
both
narrowly
watch
the
warrior
,
while
give
expression
to
their
own
fear
.
<EOS>
“Vie
<EOS>
do
not
we
start
sooner
<EOS>
don

"
<EOS>

Otto
,
his
jaw
tremble
with
fear
;
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
vot
we
dote
do
.
<EOS>
”An
<EOS>
absurd
scheme
of
escape
suggest
itself
to
Jack
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
whether
we
can
not
dash
through
the
side
of
the
lodge
and
get
away
.
<EOS>
”“wait
<EOS>
till
I
see
.
<EOS>
”otto
<EOS>
carefully
lean
back
with
a
view
of
learn
bow
much
resistance
the
deerskin
would
offer
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
quite
strong
,
they
be
not
taut
,
and
yield
so
much
that
the
boy
tip
over
backwards
,
with
his
foot
in
the
air
,
somewhat
after
the
style
of
the
baby
when
frolic
on
the
blanket
.
<EOS>
the
two
warrior
,
include
the
squaw
,
look
stolidly
at
him
,
and
there
be
not
the
trace
of
a
smile
on
any
countenance
.
<EOS>
agitate
as
be
Jack
,
he
could
not
repress
a
slight
laugh
when
he
witness
the
discomfiture
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
“Mine
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
Otto
,
clamber
to
the
sit
position
again

;

I
dinks

against

<EOS>
”jack
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
“There
's
no
use
of
try
that
;
before
we
could
get
through
they
could
catch
us
both
.
<EOS>
if
they
attack
us
,
we
will
have
to
make
the
beat
fight
we
can
.
<EOS>
”“and
dot
will
not
be
good
for
nodding
,
"
be
the
truthful
remark
of
Otto
,
who
look
toward
the
two
warrior
again
.
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
must
have
feel
he
be
entire
master
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
as
if
to
remove
any
doubt
on
that
point
in
the
mind
of
the
youth
,
he
now
set
down
the
gun
he
have
pick
up
,
lean
his
own
against
the
side
of
the
lodge
,
close
to
it
,
and
then
seat
himself
about
half
way
between
the
door
and
the
sleep
baby
.
<EOS>
this
place
him
opposite
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
closer
to
the
entrance
where
be
Otto
and
Jack
.
<EOS>
for
the
latter
to
pass
out
,
they
must
rush
by
both
warrior
,
a
feat
utterly
impossible
,
should
the
Indians
object
.
<EOS>
It
be
equally
beyond
their
power
to
secure
the
gun
,
which
would
have
prove
potent
factor
in
settle
the
question
.
<EOS>
“I
believe
he
have
leave
the
rifle
there
on
purpose
to
tempt
us
to
make
a
dash
for
them
,
"
say
Jack
,
half
inclined
to
accept
the
challenge
,
hopeless
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
“dot
<EOS>
ish
vot
<EOS>
they
do
him
for
,
"
assent
Otto
.
<EOS>
Jack
be
strongly
of
the
belief
that
other
Shawanoes
be
near
.
<EOS>
It
be
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
a
single
warrior
would
have
cross
the
Mississippi
alone
,
when
a
dozen
of
them
have
prove
unable
to
bring
the
boy
to
term
.
<EOS>
“they
have
find
we
be
in
here
,
"
be
the
thought
of
the
boy
,
"
and
become
tired
of
wait
for
us
,
have
send
this
one
to
talk
with
the
Osage
and
to
hurry
us
out
.
<EOS>
ah
,
why
do
Deerfoot
leave
us
so
soon
?
<EOS>
if
we
ever
need
him
,
now
be
the
time
.
<EOS>
”the
<EOS>
name
of
the
wonderful
youth
give
a
new
turn
to
the
thought
of
the
lad
.
<EOS>
He
ask
himself
whether
it
be
probable
that
the
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
have
send
a
party
over
to
pursue
the
boy
alone
,
or
to
revenge
themselves
upon
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
Their
enmity
against
the
latter
must
be
tenfold
great
than
it
could
be
against
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
the
most
natural
decision
to
which
the
lad
could
come
be
that
the
hostile
be
numerous
enough
to
divide
and
follow
both
trail
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
it
be
improbable
,
as
have
already
be
say
,
that
the
task
of
run
the
youth
to
earth
be
entrust
to
a
single
warrior
.
<EOS>
while
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
and
his
late
visitor
be
talk
in
their
odd
,
grant
fashion
,
the
boy
carefully
study
their
countenance
,
in
the
vain
effort
to
read
the

PURSUER
and
pursuedwhen
Deerfoot
<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
encounter
his
enemy
in
the
path
and
turn
over
the
rifle
to
him
,
he
know
that
his
leniency
toward
his
implacable
foe
have
not
soften
his
heart
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
only
await
the
opportunity
to
turn
like
a
rattlesnake
on
his
magnanimous
master
,
and
the
youth
therefore
take
particular
care
that
such
opportunity
should
not
be
give
him
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
hold
his
tomahawk
tightly
grasp
and
poise
,
determine
to
hurl
it
with
resistless
and
unerring
aim
on
the
very
first
move
of
the
warrior
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
remain
as
rigid
as
bronze
until
the
other
be
a
couple
of
rod
distant
.
<EOS>
then
he
noiselessly
shove
back
the
tomahawk
in
his
girdle
,
pick
up
his
bow
and
vanish
like
a
shadow
.
<EOS>
when
the
warrior
turn
,
as
the
reader
will
recall
,
he
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
be
confident
that
after
such
a
meeting
,
the
one
whom
he
have
spare
would
not
follow
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
glad
enough
to
escape
altogether
without
arouse
the
wrath
of
him
who
would
not
show
mercy
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
matchless
youth
speed
along
the
path
in
the
gathering
gloom
,
with
that
swiftness
which
earn
him
his
expressive
name
while
he
be
yet
a
mere
boy
.
<EOS>
no
man
,
american
or
Caucasian
,
could
hold
his
own
against
him
in
his
phenomenal
fleetness
.
<EOS>
He
sweep
through
the
forest
,
never
pause
,
but
dart
forward
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
,
that
elude
by
the
marvelous
quickness
of
eye
the
labyrinth
of
limb
and
obstruction
which
interpose
almost
every
second
across
his
line
of
flight
.
<EOS>
not
until
he
have
speed
fully
a
half
mile
do
slacken
in
the
slight
his
astonishing
pace
,
and
then
there
be
not
the
least
quickening
of
the
pulse
or
hastening
of
the
gentle
breath
.
<EOS>
have
choose
,
he
could
have
maintain
the
same
for
hour
without
discomfort
or
fatigue
.
<EOS>
while
,
in
one
sense
,
Deerfoot
be
flee
a
Shawanoe
,
he
be
,
in
the
same
sense
,
pursue
another
,
in
whom
his
chief
interest
center
.
<EOS>
the
night
deepen
,
and
the
moon
,
climb
above
the
tree
top
,
penetrate
the
gloomy
recess
in
few
place
with
its
silvery
beam
.
<EOS>
when
a
mile
have
be
pass
,
the
young
warrior
pause
and
listen
.
<EOS>
“He
can
not
follow
me
when
his
eye
see
no
trail
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
allude
to
the
Shawanoe
whom
he
have
spare
.
<EOS>
It
follow
as
a
corollary
that
the
same
difficulty
confront
him
in
pursue
his
friend
and
the
enemy
who
cling
so
close
to
their
footprint
.
<EOS>
He
stop
and
softly
pass
his
hand
over
the
leafy
ground
.
<EOS>
not
the
slight
artificial
depression
be
there
;
he
have
lose
the
trail
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
utterly
out
of
the
question
to
learn
how
far
he
have
diverge
from
the
path
,
it
be
also
beyond
his
power
to
return
to
it
—
that
is
,
so
long
as
the
night
last
.
<EOS>
the
hoof
-
print
of
the
horse
be
cut
so
deep
in
the
yield
earth
that
,
with
considerable
trouble
,
he
could
have
trace
them
among
the
tree
;
but
even
then
he
would
lack
the
great
help
which
the
scout
be
generally
able
to
command
.
<EOS>
in
follow
a
trail
at
night
,
he
need
to
possess
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
country
,
so
as
to
reason
out
the
probable
destination
of
his
enemy
,
and
consequently
the
general
route
they
will
take
.
<EOS>
more
than
likely
they
will
aim
for
some
crossing
or
camping
ground
,
many
mile
in
advance
.
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
the
hunter
may
enable
him
to
take
a
short
course
and
,
by
put
his
horse
to
his
good
,
reach
of
them
.
<EOS>
about
all
he
do
,
when
engage
in
this
hot
chase
,
be
to
take
his
observation
at
widely
separate
point
,
with
a
view
of
learning
he
be
go
astray
.
<EOS>
It
be
precisely
in
this
manner
that
the
great
scout
of
modern
day
,
Kit
Carson
,
lead
a
party
on
the
heel
of
a
party
of
mexican
horse
-
thief
,
with
his
steed
on
a
fall
gallop
the
night
thoroughly
overtake
the
criminal
at
daylight
,
chastise
them
and
recapture
the
steal
property
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
be
lack
in
that
one
requisite
—
familiarity
with
the
country
.
<EOS>
He
have
journey
up
and
down
the
shore
of
the
Mississippi
,
have
visit
the
settlement
further
west
,
and
have
gain
much
knowledge
of
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
present
State
of
Missouri
;
but
this
member
of
our
Union
occupy
an
immense
area
,
and
year
would
be
need
to
enable
him
to
act
as
guide
through
every
section
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
travel
in
many
part
,
and
it
will
be
perceive
,
therefore
,
that
it
be
out
of
his
power
to
theorize
in
the
wonderfully
brilliant
manner
which
often
make
his
success
due
to
an
intuitive
inspiration
that
at
time
seem
to
hover
on
the
verge
of
the
unknowable
sixth
sense
.
<EOS>
but
strange
must
be
the
occasion
in
which
Deerfoot
would
feel
compel
to
fold
his
,
arm
and
say
,
"
I
can
do
no
more
.
”He
<EOS>
have
stand
less
than
three
minute
in
the
attitude
of
deep
attention
,
when
he
emit
a
peculiar
flutter
whistle
,
such
as
a
timid
night
bird
sometimes
make
from
its
perch
in
the
up
most
branch
,
while
call
to
its
mate
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
tremble
on
the
air
,
when
a
response
come
from
a
point
not
far
away
and
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Could
any
one
have
see
the
face
of
the
youthful
Shawanoe
,
he
would
have
observe
a
faint
but
grim
smile
play
around
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
have
utter
the
signal
which
the
Shawanoes
rarely
use
.
<EOS>
when
member
of
their
scout
become
temporarily
lose
from
each
other
,
while
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
an
enemy
,
and
it
be
necessary
they
should
locate
themselves
,
they
do
so
by
mean
of
the
signal
describe
.
<EOS>
They
refrain
from
appeal
to
it
except
in
case
of
the
utmost
urgency
,
for
if
use
too
often
it
be
likely
to
become
known
to
their
enemy
and
its
usefulness
thus
destroy
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
have
secure
a
reply
from
the
Shawanoe
for
whom
he
be
hunt
,
and
thus
learn
his
precise
whereabout
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
begin
steal
his
way
toward
him
.
<EOS>
the
usage
among
this
remarkable
tribe
of
Indians
require
him
to
repeat
the
peculiar
cry
after
hear
it
,
and
the
party
of
the
second
should
respond
similarly
.
<EOS>
when
the
call
have
be
waft
back
and
forth
in
this
fashion
,
Shawanoe
law
forbid
its
repetition
,
except
after
a
considerable
interval
,
and
then
only
under
the
most
urgent
necessity
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
hold
his
peace
,
though
he
know
warrior
be
await
his
answer
.
<EOS>
fail
to
call
the
response
,
the
other
would
conclude
that
the
signal
be
in
truth
the
call
of
a
bird
;
but
to
guard
against
any
error
,
he
repeat
the
tremulous
whistle
,
when
the
stealthy
Deerfoot
be
within
a
few
rod
.
<EOS>
the
latter
could
have
take
his
life
with
suddenness
almost
of
the
lightning
bolt
,
but
he
have
no
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
if
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
be
in
danger
it
would
be
from
this
warrior
alone
,
and
so
long
as
Deerfoot
could
keep
him
"
in
hand
"
no
such
danger
exist
.
<EOS>
in
the
open
forest
,
where
the
moonlight
penetrate
,
a
shadowy
figure
assume
shape
,
and
the
pursuer
recognize
it
as
that
of
the
indian
whom
he
be
so
anxious
to
find
.
<EOS>
He
have
conclude
to
wait
no
longer
,
and
be
advance
in
a
blind
way
along
the
trail
of
the
lad
.
<EOS>
deerfoot
stoop
and
pass
his
hand
over
the
ground
.
<EOS>
one
sweep
be
enough
to
,
identify
the
print
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
,
and
the
more
delicate
impression
make
by
shoe
and
moccasin
.
<EOS>
the
young
Shawanoe
,
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
trail
,
do
that
which
will
scarcely
be
believe
:
he
ascertain
that
one
pair
of
moccasin
go
forward
and
the
other
take
the
opposite
course
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
the
Shawanoes
have
part
company
at
a
point
slightly
in
advance
(
it
could
not
be
far
)
,
and
the
warrior
whom
he
see
must
have
wait
where
he
be
while
the
night
be
close
in
.
<EOS>
a
few
rod
further
and
a
second
examination
reveal
the
trail
of
a
single
pair
of
moccasin
,
the
line
of
demarcation
have
be
pass
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
elder
be
push
among

,
Deerfoot
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
now
and
then
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
regulate
his
own
pace
that
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
be
needful
also
that
much
circumspection
should
be
use
,
for
when
one
person
can
trace
the
movement
of
another
,
it
follow
that
the
possibility
be
reciprocal
and
the
law
vice
versa
obtain
.
<EOS>
the
youth
therefore
hold
resolutely
back
,
and
so
guard
his
movement
that
he
be
assure
against
detection
by
any
glance
the
warrior
may
cast
behind
him
.
<EOS>
the
tree
in

diminish
in
number

soon
cease
altogether

<EOS>
the
Shawanoe
have
reach
the
edge

a
natural
opening

clearing

<EOS>
pause
a
moment
,
he
step
out
where
the

shine
full
upon
him
,
and
then
halt
again

<EOS>
have
the
advantage
of
cover
,
Deerfoot
slip
carefully
forward
,
until
he
stand
within
a
few
yard
of
the
red
man
,
who
little
dream
of
the
dreaded
one
that
be
within
the
throw
of
a
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
the
eld
Indian
seem
to
be
speculate
the
probable
course
of
the
unconscious
fugitive
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
suppose
that
he
be
familiar
with
the
country
(
since
his
home
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mississippi
)
,
but
like
the
majority
of
mankind
when
in
difficulty
,
he
be
able
to
form
a
theory
,
but
unlike
that
majority
,
he
prove
his
faith
in
it
by
his
work
.
<EOS>
instead
of
follow
the
footprint
,
he
diverge
to
the
right
and
course
along
the
edge
of
the
clearing
,
where
he
be
almost
entirely
conceal
by
the
shadow
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
go
far
,
when
Deerfoot
silently
emerge
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
His
keen
eye
reveal
what
must
have
be
notice
by
the
other
:
on
that
spot
the
boy
have
stop
with
the
intention
of
encamp
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
have
they
remain
,
beyond
all
doubt
one
or
both
would
have
be
slay
,
but
from
some
cause
(
long
since
explain
to
the
reader
)
<EOS>
they
pass
on
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
hurry
on
with
a
speed
that
be
almost
reckless
,
for
that
marvelous
intuition
seem
to
whisper
that
the
crisis
be
near
.
<EOS>
His
friend
could
not
be
far
off
,
and
the
question
of
safety
or
danger
must
be
speedily
settle
.
<EOS>
just
beyond
the
clearing
,
while
hasten
forward
,
he
catch
,
the
glow
of
the
fire
shine
through
the
rent
and
crevice
of
the
shabby
skin
of
the
Osage
wigwam

He
hear
the
of
voice
within
,
and
a
few
second
later
he
be
peep
through

<EOS>
turn
the
tablesalthough
Jack
Carleton
and
Otto
Relstaub
understand
nothing
of
the
conversation
(
except
the
few
word
of
mangle
English
)
between
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
,
the
Osage
chieftain
,
and
the
Shawanoe
who
enter
his
lodge
,
little
be
lose
upon
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
without
quote
the
language
,
it
may
be
say
that
Arorara
declare
the
two
boy
to
be
thief
and
wretch
of
the
bad
imaginable
degree
.
<EOS>
They
have
steal
the
horse
of
the
Shawanoes
and
Miamis
,
and
have
treacherously
shoot
,
not
only
the
warrior
,
but
the
squaw
and
papoose
,
when
they
lie
asleep
by
their
camp
-
fire
.
<EOS>
Arorara
say
he
have
be
send
by
his
people
to
follow
across
the
river
,
and
punish
them
for
their
many
crime
.
<EOS>
His
purpose
in
place
the
gun
as
he
have
do
,
near
the
entrance
of
the
lodge
,
be
to
tempt
the
boy
to
make
a
rush
to
escape
.
<EOS>
when
they
do
so
,
Arorara
propose
that
he
and
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
should
leap
upon
them
with
knife
.
<EOS>
when
this
plan
be
fully
explain
to
the
chief
,
he
nod
his
head
and
signify
that
he
would
willingly
lend
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
,
and
,
but
for
the
coming
of
the
Shawanoe
,
he
probably
would
have
allow
the
boy
to
depart
without
harm
.
<EOS>
with
Wish
-
o
-
wa
-
tum
the
whole
question
resolve
itself
into
one
of
policy
.
<EOS>
He
live
alone
and
have
never
be
disturb
by
the
white
settler
,
who
be
locate
in
different
part
of
the
territory
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
help
in
the
taking
off
of
youngster
,
their
friend
would
not
be
likely
to
suspect
him
,
and
there
be
little
probability
of
the
truth
ever
reach
their
ear
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
refuse
the
request
of
the
guest
,
the
fierce
tribe
to
which
he
belong
would
be
sure
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
punish
him
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
give
his
assent
,
and
add
that
he
be
ready
do
his
part
whenever
Arorara
wish
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
that
juncture
that
the
two
red
man
essay
expression
in
English
,
and
Deerfoot
see
that
he
must
interfere
at
once
.
<EOS>
while
move
to
the
front
of
the
lodge
,
he
scan
his
immediate
surrounding
,
so
far
as
he
could
,
but
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
of
the
other
Shawanoe
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
from
what
have
already
be
tell
,
it
will
be
see
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
be
in
that
vicinity
.
<EOS>
throw
back
the
deerskin
,
the
youthful
warrior
step
quickly
within
the
wigwam
.
<EOS>
His
bow
be
flung
over
his
back
,
and
,
be
perfectly
familiar
with
the
interior
,
he
extend
his
hand
and
catch
up
the
weapon
near
him
,
stand
erect
and
face
all
the
occupant
as
do
Arorara
a
short
time
before
.
<EOS>
this
movement
and
the
entrance
itself
be
make
with
such
deftness
that
no
one
observe
his
presence
,
with
the
exception
of
Otto
Relstaub
,
who
by
accident
happen
to
look
toward
him
just
as
he
enter
.
<EOS>
but
the
startling
word
of
the
german
lad
,
accompany
by
the
extension
of
his
arm
and
finger
toward
the
door
,
turn
every
eye
like
a
flash
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
They
be
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
arm
of
Deerfoot
,
as
they
be
raise
like
the
flitting
of
the
wing
of
a
bird
,
and
almost
in
the
same
breath
the
youth
be
see
to
be
look
along
the
gleam

the
breast
of
the
astounded
warrior

<EOS>
“Dog

but
the

of
Deerfoot

here
,
and
he
dare
Arorara
and

and
Tecumseh

all
the

and

and
warrior
of
the
Shawanoes
,
to

with
the

,
<EOS>

to
the
ground
,
and
whip
out
his
hunting
knife
,
the
youth
grasp
the
handle
with
finger
of
steel
and
assume
a
defiant
attitude
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
aflame
with
passion
,
and
his
breast
become
a
rage
volcano
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
Deerfoot
have
lose
control
of
himself
for
the
moment

<EOS>
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
persecution

his
nature
to
revolt
,
and
he
long
for
the
excuse
to
leap
upon
the
Shawanoe
who
have
follow
him
across
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
single
moment
when
he
gather
his
muscle
for
a
tiger
-
like
bind
at
his
enemy
,
he
be
restrain
only
by
the
pitiful
expression
on
the
terrified
countenance

<EOS>
the
youth

his
word
to
Arorara
and
his
blaze

fix
on
him

<EOS>
He
have
no
quarrel
with
Wish

and
understand
his
position
,
but
he
would
not
have
shrink
from
an
attack
by
both
.
<EOS>
Deerfoot
know
that
either
be
more
powerful
than
he
,
but
in

-
like
agility
there
could
be
no

between

very
plainly
that
he

the

of
his
lodge
in

fear
.
<EOS>
He
display
visible
emotion
,
when
listen
to
the
ring
word
of
defiance
;
but
he
possess
sense
enough
to
perceive
they
be
not

to
him
,
and
he
continue
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
silence
.
<EOS>
the
squaw
at
the
further
end
of
the
wigwam
start
,
and
with
the
pipe
in
her
grasp
,
stare
with
a
dazed
expression
at
the
dare
intruder
;
then
,
like
the
true

forward
,

up
her
sleeping
infant
and
hold
him
to

him
with

<EOS>
Arorara
look
in
turn
straight
into
the
burn
countenance
of
Deerfoot
.
<EOS>
the
eld
warrior
have
unconsciously
assume
an
admirable
pose
,
his
left
foot
forward
,
his

on

his
whole

<EOS>
while
in
this
attitude
,
which
may
have

as

the
most
heroic
courage
,
Deerfoot
see
the
lump
or
Adam

in
his
throat

precisely
as
if
he

something

<EOS>
It
be
do
twice
,
and
be
a
sign
of
weakness
on
the
part
of
Arorara
.
<EOS>
the
consume
anger
of
Deerfoot
burn
out
like
a
flash
of
powder
.
<EOS>
Hatred
become
contempt
;
enmity
turn
to

and
the
mortal

<EOS>
“Who

now

"
<EOS>
ask
Deerfoot
in
English
,
with
a
curl
of
his
lip
.
<EOS>
"
Arorara
be
brave
when
he
stand
before
the
youth
who
have
no
weapon
;
he
then
speak
with
the
double
tongue
;
he
can
not
utter
the
truth

<EOS>
Arorara

his
tomahawk

knife

Deerfoot

his
;

”arorara

that
he
be

could
not

into

lithe
and
willowy
youth

<EOS>
It
be
not
flattering
to
the
pride
of
the
young
Kentuckian
and
his
companion
that
while
Arorara
feel
no
fear
of

terrify

he
would

himself

nothing

<EOS>
it

close
to
the

which
cause
overturning
of
Otto
,
but
now
it
be
another
obstruction
in
the
shape
of
a
tree
trunk
,
over
which
Jack
step
,
take
care
however
,
to
say
nothing
to
his
companion
concern
it
.
<EOS>
the
small
stick
lie
near
make
it
look
as
if
the
trunk
serve
to
help
the
squaw
of
Man

not
-
afraid
-
of

thunder
,
when
she
be
break
or
cut
wood
for
the
wigwam

<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
the
heel
of
Otto
strike
it
<EOS>
and
he
go
over
on
his
back
,
with
hat
and
gun
flying
and
shoe
point
upward
.
<EOS>
“i
dink

he
say
,
clamber
to
his
foot
and
shake
himself
together
again

<EOS>
“you're
get
to
be
the
good
fellow
at
tumble
<EOS>
I
ever
see

Jack

suppressing
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
his
laughter
.
<EOS>
“dot

ish
<EOS>
so
,
"
assent
the
victim
,
too
good
-
natured
to
find
fault
after
his
fortunate
escape
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
they
be
so
far
from
the
Osage
lodge
that
very
little
could
be
see
of
the
interior
,
and
they
turn
round
and
walk
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
“it
seem
like
a
dream
,
"
remark
the
young
Kentuckian
;
"
a
few
minute
ago
,
there
be
no
escape
for
us
,
and
now
I
can
not
think
we
be
in
the
least
danger
.
<EOS>
”“Who
dink
dot
de
Shawanoes
come
over
der
river
after
us
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Otto
.
<EOS>
“nobody
<EOS>
besides
Deerfoot
:
there
be
not
anything
that
he
do
not
think
of
that
be
worth
think
about

<EOS>
”“den
<EOS>
vy
he
leave
us
,
<EOS>
when
we
leave
him?”“I've
ask
myself
that
question
,
Otto
;
it
must
be
that
,
after
we
part
,
he
learn
something
which
tell
him
the
Shawanoes
have
cross
the
Mississippi
after
us
.
<EOS>
He
change
his
course
and
come
to
our
help
,
and
it
be
mighty
fortunate
<EOS>
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
guess
<EOS>
dot
ish
<EOS>
so
;
we
will
ask
him
when
we
do
not
see
him

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
my
doubt
about
see
him
again

<EOS>
”“How
ish
<EOS>
dot?”“you
remember
he
say
more
than
once
he
have
reason
to
take
another
course
,
and
he
do
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
be
blame
for
believe
we
be
able
to
get
along
without
him
,
after
enter
Louisiana
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
will
think
so
now
.
<EOS>
”This
be
a
reasonable
conclusion
,
and
Otto
agree
with
his
friend
that
they
be
not
likely
to
meet
the
extraordinary
youth
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
take
another
direction
,
for
,
after
the
threat
he
utter
to
Arorara
,
and
the
panic
into
which
he
have
throw
him
,
that
warrior
would
be
glad
to
hasten
back
to
his
friend
,
who
be
equally
eager
to
reach
Kentucky
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
wood
open
.
<EOS>
much
to
the
relief
of
Otto
,
the
vine
give
him
no
further
trouble
,
and
they
progress
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
neighborhood
be
strange
to
them
,
but
they
have
tramp
the
wilderness
too
often
to
care
.
<EOS>
They
be
sure
of
the
general
direction
they
be
follow
,
and
be
confident
now
of
reach
home
,
which
could
be
no
great
distance
away
.
<EOS>
such
a
buoyancy
of
spirit
come
over
the
boy
that
it
be
hard
to
restrain
themselves
from
shout
and
leap
with
joy
.
<EOS>
but
for
the
mishap
attend
such
sport
they
would
have
run
at
full
speed
and
fling
their
hat
in
air

<EOS>
several
mile
be
pass
before
they
become
thoughtful
and
quiet
.

“Mine
gracious
!

<EOS>
abruptly
exclaim
Otto
,
stop
short
and
strike
his
knee
a
resounding
whack
;
"

<EOS>
you

“i

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
,
more
than
once

I
make
up
my
mind

when
I
find
you
in
the
wigwam
,
that
if
you
get
out
alive

I
would
insist
that
we
go
straight
home
and
think
no
more
about
the
animal

we
will
wait

to

”“Dot

Otto
,
nod
his
head
several
time

<EOS>

nearly

stop
for

night

<EOS>
They
be
fully
warrant
in
believe
that
all
danger
from
red
man
be
end
;
and
,
as
they
have
no
means
of
find
a
good
camping
site

they
stop
at
once
and
begin
gather
fuel

<EOS>
the
task
be
soon
over
,
and
the
flint
and
steel
give
the
speedily
grow
into
a
roaring
blaze

the

sit
and
look
in
each
other

<EOS>
the
night
be
cool
,

pleasant

<EOS>
cloud
,
however
,
be
continually
drift
across
the
face
of
the
moon

and
a
certain
restlessness
of
feeling
,
of
which
even
the
rugged
youngster
be
sensible
,
tell
that
a
change
be
come
.
<EOS>
the
hour
spend
in
the
Osage
wigwam
be
redolent
of
smoke
venison
,
and
the
boy
smack
their
lip
and
shake
their
head
,
after
the
manner
of
youngster
,
with
healthful
appetite
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
way
of
procure
food

and
they
philosophically
accept
the
situation

refrain
from
reference

eatable
until
there
be
a
prospect
of
obtain
them
.
<EOS>
through
all
the
eventful
experience
of
the
evening
,
Jack
and
Otto
have
retain
their
blanket
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
such
that
neither
of
the
Indians
with
whom
they
be
bring
in
contact

them

seat
by
the
cheerful
fire

the
friend
talk
in
rambling
fashion
until
drowsy
,
when
they
wrap
their
blanket
around
them
and
lie
down
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
some
risk
be
involve
in
the
proceeding
,
inasmuch
as
the
fire
be
likely
to
attract
wild
animal
to
the
spot
,
but
providentially
none
disturb
the
young
pioneer
,
who
sleep
quiet
and
security
until
the
sun

<EOS>
the
first
step
be
a
hunt
for
breakfast

for
Jack

Otto

in
a
state
of
ravenous
hunger

<EOS>
They

a
half
hour

young
Kentuckian

his
head
by
way

hard

an
almost
insurmountable
difficulty

first

It
be
impossible
to
make

only

Jack

when

his
bearing
by

he
learn
they
have
wander
from

<EOS>
They
have
turn
to
the
left

until
the
course
be
south
of
southwest

<EOS>
They
have
go
far
astray
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
weather
become
more
threatening
.
<EOS>
the
sun
have
be
above
the
horizon
less
than
an
hour
when
its
light
be
obscure
by
cloud
,
and
the
window
of

be
certain
to
be
open
long
before

<EOS>
two
mile

find
themselves
so
close

clearing

that
they
wonder
how
it

their
notice
the
precede

<EOS>
It
cover
more
than
an
acre

and
at
one
time
be
the
site
of
an
indian
village

<EOS>
as
a
matter
of

a
small

the
red
man

have

fully
a

<EOS>
while
wander
over
the
tract
and
look
about
them
,
their
eye
rest
on
an
elevation
no
more
than
a
third
of
a
mile
distant

<EOS>
It
be
thickly
woode
,
but
a
prodigious
rock
near
the

resemble
a
spot

clear

<EOS>
“Helloa

<EOS>

suddenly
call
out
Jack

there

the

wave
his

in
friendly
salutation
several
minute
,
then
leap
from
the
rock

vanish

It
look
as
if
he
have
take
several
hour
to
assure
himself
the
boy
be
in
no
danger
from
the
Shawanoes

and
,
have
do
so

he
now
bade
them
good

his
characteristic
fashion

give
his
whole
thought

energy
to
the
business
which
carry
him
far
into

southwestern
portion
of

State

<EOS>
Jack
and
Otto
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
rock
a
considerable
while
,
hope
their
friend
would
reappear
,
or
that
he
have
start
to
join

they
be
compel

believe
he
have
leave

for
a
time
at

would

<EOS>
the

follow
the

some
distance
further

to
their
delight
they
come
upon

so
distinctly

“Now

”'The
German
gaze
at
his

on
the
point

reprove
him

conclude
to
take
time
to
put
his

<EOS>
an
interesting
fact
be
notice
by
both

the

verge
toward
the
elevation
where
they
last
see
Deerfoot

<EOS>
Jack
Carleton
be
set
to
think
and
speculate
over
the
situation
.
<EOS>
He
ask
himself
whether
,
when
Deerfoot
be
about
to
pass
out
of
their
sight
,
his
gesticulation
do
not
signify
more
than
his
friend
suppose

<EOS>
“I
wonder
if

in

approvingly

<EOS>
“We

”But
<EOS>
an
unpleasant
truth
force
itself
on
their
notice
.
<EOS>
rain
drop
be
patter
upon
the
leave
,
and
the
darkening
sky
presage
a
storm

<EOS>
as
the
good
and
indeed
the
only
way
to
protect
themselves
against
a
good
drenching
,
the
boy
select
a
tree
whose
foliage
be
particularly
abundant
,
and
seat
themselves
on
the
ground
with
their
back
against
it
.
<EOS>
then
the
blanket
be
gather
over
their
head
and
around
their
shoulder
,
and
they
feel
as
secure
as
if
in
their
own
log
cabin
,
mile
distant

<EOS>
the
rain
fall
steadily
for
nearly
two
hour
,
when
it
gradually
cease

and
Jack
and
Otto
quickly
make
ready
to
resume
their
journey
.
<EOS>
the
leave

twig

limb
be
drip
with
moisture
,
so
that
,
with
the

care
,
it
be
impossible

far
without
their
garment

saturate

<EOS>
that
,
however
,
be
not

cause

<EOS>
for
some
rod

but
then
come
the
trouble

<EOS>
the
rain
have
beat
down
the
leave
on
the
ground
with
such
force
that
even
the
keen
eye
of
the
young
Kentuckian
begin
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
finally
the
two
paused
,
and
Otto

have
carefully
