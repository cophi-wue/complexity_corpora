if
you
look
at
a
Map
of
the
World
,
you
will
see
,
in
the
left
-
hand
upper
corner
of
the
Eastern
Hemisphere
,
two
Islands
lie
in
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
England
and
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
England
and
Scotland
form
the
great
part
of
these
Islands
.
 
<EOS>
Ireland
be
the
next
in
size
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
neighbouring
island
,
which
be
so
small
upon
the
Map
as
to
be
mere
dot
,
be
chiefly
little
bit
of
Scotland
,
---
break
off
,
I
dare
say
,
in
the
course
of
a
great
length
of
time
,
by
the
power
of
the
restless
water
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
old
day
,
a
long
,
long
while
ago
,
before
Our
Saviour
be
bear
on
earth
and
lie
asleep
in
a
manger
,
these
Islands
be
in
the
same
place
,
and
the
stormy
sea
roar
round
them
,
just
as
it
roar
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
sea
be
not
alive
,
then
,
with
great
ship
and
brave
sailor
,
sail
to
and
from
all
part
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
lonely
.
 
<EOS>
the
Islands
lie
solitary
,
in
the
great
expanse
of
water
.
<EOS>
the
foam
wave
dash
against
their
cliff
,
and
the
bleak
wind
blow
over
their
forest
;
but
the
wind
and
wave
bring
no
adventurer
to
land
upon
the
Islands
,
and
the
savage
Islanders
know
nothing
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
know
nothing
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
that
the
Phoenicians
,
who
be
an
ancient
people
,
famous
for
carry
on
trade
,
come
in
ship
to
these
Islands
,
and
find
that
they
produce
tin
and
lead
;
both
very
useful
thing
,
as
you
know
,
and
both
produce
to
this
very
hour
upon
the
sea
-
coast
.
<EOS>
the
most
celebrated
tin
mine
in
Cornwall
be
,
still
,
close
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
which
I
have
see
,
be
so
close
to
it
that
it
be
hollow
out
underneath
the
ocean
;
and
the
miner
say
,
that
in
stormy
weather
,
when
they
be
at
work
down
in
that
deep
place
,
they
can
hear
the
noise
of
the
wave
thunder
above
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
Phoenicians
,
coast
about
the
Islands
,
would
come
,
without
much
difficulty
,
to
where
the
tin
and
lead
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
Phoenicians
trade
with
the
Islanders
for
these
metal
,
and
give
the
Islanders
some
other
useful
thing
in
exchange
.
 
<EOS>
the
Islanders
be
,
at
first
,
poor
savage
,
go
almost
naked
,
or
only
dress
in
the
rough
skin
of
beast
,
and
stain
their
body
,
as
other
savage
do
,
with
coloured
earth
and
the
juice
of
plant
.
<EOS>
but
the
Phoenicians
,
sail
over
to
the
opposite
coast
of
France
and
Belgium
,
and
say
to
the
people
there
,
"
We
have
be
to
those
white
cliff
across
the
water
,
which
you
can
see
in
fine
weather
,
and
from
that
country
,
which
be
call
BRITAIN
,
we
bring
this
tin
and
lead
,
"
tempt
some
of
the
french
and
Belgians
to
come
over
also
.
 
<EOS>
these
people
settle
themselves
on
the
south
coast
of
England
,
which
be
now
call
Kent
;
and
,
although
they
be
a
rough
people
too
,
they
teach
the
savage
briton
some
useful
art
,
and
improve
that
part
of
the
Islands
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
other
people
come
over
from
Spain
to
Ireland
,
and
settle
there
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
by
little
and
little
,
stranger
become
mixed
with
the
Islanders
,
and
the
savage
Britons
grow
into
a
wild
,
bold
people
;
almost
savage
,
still
,
especially
in
the
interior
of
the
country
away
from
the
sea
where
the
foreign
settler
seldom
go
;
but
hardy
,
brave
,
and
strong
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
country
be
cover
with
forest
,
and
swamp
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
it
be
very
misty
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
road
,
no
bridge
,
no
street
,
no
house
that
you
would
think
deserve
of
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
a
town
be
nothing
but
a
collection
of
straw
-
cover
hut
,
hide
in
a
thick
wood
,
with
a
ditch
all
round
,
and
a
low
wall
,
make
of
mud
,
or
the
trunk
of
tree
place
one
upon
another
.
<EOS>
the
people
plant
little
or
no
corn
,
but
live
upon
the
flesh
of
their
flock
and
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
no
coin
,
but
use
metal
ring
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
clever
in
basket
-
work
,
as
savage
people
often
be
;
and
they
could
make
a
coarse
kind
of
cloth
,
and
some
very
bad
earthenware
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
build
fortress
they
be
much
more
clever
.
  
<EOS>
They
make
boat
of
basket
-
work
,
cover
with
the
skin
of
animal
,
but
seldom
,
if
ever
,
venture
far
from
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
sword
,
of
copper
mix
with
tin
;
but
,
these
sword
be
of
an
awkward
shape
,
and
so
soft
that
a
heavy
blow
would
bend
one
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
light
shield
,
short
pointed
dagger
,
and
spear
---
which
they
jerk
back
after
they
have
throw
them
at
an
enemy
,
by
a
long
strip
of
leather
fasten
to
the
stem
.
 
<EOS>
the
butt
-
end
be
a
rattle
,
to
frighten
an
enemy
's
horse
.
 
<EOS>
the
ancient
briton
,
be
divide
into
as
many
as
thirty
or
forty
tribe
,
each
command
by
its
own
little
king
,
be
constantly
fight
with
one
another
,
as
savage
people
usually
do
;
and
they
always
fight
with
these
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
very
fond
of
horse
.
 
<EOS>
the
standard
of
Kent
be
the
picture
of
a
white
horse
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
break
them
in
and
manage
them
wonderfully
well
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
horse
(
of
which
they
have
an
abundance
,
though
they
be
rather
small
)
be
so
well
teach
in
those
day
,
that
they
can
scarcely
be
say
to
have
improve
since
;
though
the
man
be
so
much
wise
.
 
<EOS>
They
understand
,
and
obey
,
every
word
of
command
;
and
would
stand
still
by
themselves
,
in
all
the
din
and
noise
of
battle
,
while
their
master
go
to
fight
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
the
Britons
could
not
have
succeed
in
their
most
remarkable
art
,
without
the
aid
of
these
sensible
and
trusty
animal
.
 
<EOS>
the
art
<EOS>
I
mean
,
be
the
construction
and
management
of
war
-
chariot
or
car
,
for
which
they
have
ever
be
celebrate
in
history
.
 
<EOS>
each
of
the
good
sort
of
these
chariot
,
not
quite
breast
high
in
front
,
and
open
at
the
back
,
contain
one
man
to
drive
,
and
two
or
three
other
to
fight
---
all
stand
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
who
draw
them
be
so
well
train
,
that
they
would
tear
,
at
full
gallop
,
over
the
most
stony
way
,
and
even
through
the
wood
;
dash
down
their
master
"
enemy
beneath
their
hoofs
,
and
cut
them
to
piece
with
the
blade
of
sword
,
or
scythe
,
which
be
fasten
to
the
wheel
,
and
stretch
out
beyond
the
car
on
each
side
,
for
that
cruel
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
,
while
at
full
speed
,
the
horse
would
stop
,
at
the
driver
's
command
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
within
would
leap
out
,
deal
blow
about
them
with
their
sword
like
hail
,
leap
on
the
horse
,
on
the
pole
,
spring
back
into
the
chariot
anyhow
;
and
,
as
soon
as
they
be
safe
,
the
horse
tear
away
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
Britons
have
a
strange
and
terrible
religion
,
call
the
Religion
of
the
Druids
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
have
be
bring
over
,
in
very
early
time
indeed
,
from
the
opposite
country
of
France
,
anciently
call
Gaul
,
and
to
have
mix
up
the
worship
of
the
Serpent
,
and
of
the
Sun
and
Moon
,
with
the
worship
of
some
of
the
Heathen
Gods
and
Goddesses
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
its
ceremony
be
keep
secret
by
the
priest
,
the
Druids
,
who
pretend
to
be
enchanter
,
and
who
carry
magician
"
wand
,
and
wear
,
each
of
them
,
about
his
neck
,
what
he
tell
the
ignorant
people
be
a
Serpent
's
egg
in
a
golden
case
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
certain
that
the
druidical
ceremony
include
the
sacrifice
of
human
victim
,
the
torture
of
some
suspect
criminal
,
and
,
on
particular
occasion
,
even
the
burn
alive
,
in
immense
wicker
cage
,
of
a
number
of
man
and
animal
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
Druid
Priests
have
some
kind
of
veneration
for
the
Oak
,
and
for
the
mistletoe
---
the
same
plant
that
we
hang
up
in
house
at
Christmas
Time
now
---
when
its
white
berry
grow
upon
the
Oak
.
 
<EOS>
They
meet
together
in
dark
wood
,
which
they
call
Sacred
Groves
;
and
there
they
instruct
,
in
their
mysterious
art
,
young
man
who
come
to
them
as
pupil
,
and
who
sometimes
stay
with
them
as
long
as
twenty
year
.
  
<EOS>
these
Druids
build
great
temple
and
altar
,
open
to
the
sky
,
fragment
of
some
of
which
be
yet
remain
.
 
<EOS>
Stonehenge
,
on
Salisbury
Plain
,
in
wiltshire
,
be
the
most
extraordinary
of
these
.
<EOS>
three
curious
stone
,
call
Kits
Coty
House
,
on
Bluebell
Hill
,
near
Maidstone
,
in
Kent
,
form
another
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
,
from
examination
of
the
great
block
of
which
such
building
be
make
,
that
they
could
not
have
be
raise
without
the
aid
of
some
ingenious
machine
,
which
be
common
now
,
but
which
the
ancient
briton
certainly
do
not
use
in
make
their
own
uncomfortable
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
the
Druids
,
and
their
pupil
who
stay
with
them
twenty
year
,
know
more
than
the
rest
of
the
Britons
,
keep
the
people
out
of
sight
while
they
make
these
building
,
and
then
pretend
that
they
build
them
by
magic
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
have
a
hand
in
the
fortress
too
;
at
all
event
,
as
they
be
very
powerful
,
and
very
much
believe
in
,
and
as
they
make
and
execute
the
law
,
and
pay
no
taxis
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
they
like
their
trade
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
they
persuade
the
people
the
more
Druids
there
be
,
the
well
off
the
people
would
be
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
there
be
a
good
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
pleasant
to
think
that
there
be
no
Druids
,
now
,
who
go
on
in
that
way
,
and
pretend
to
carry
enchanter
"
Wands
and
Serpents
"
Eggs
---
<EOS>
and
of
course
there
be
nothing
of
the
kind
,
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
improved
condition
of
the
ancient
briton
,
fifty
-
five
year
before
the
birth
of
Our
Saviour
,
when
the
Romans
,
under
their
great
General
,
Julius
Caesar
,
be
master
of
all
the
rest
of
the
known
world
.
 
<EOS>
Julius
Caesar
have
then
just
conquer
Gaul
;
and
hearing
,
in
Gaul
,
a
good
deal
about
the
opposite
Island
with
the
white
cliff
,
and
about
the
bravery
of
the
Britons
who
inhabit
it
---
some
of
whom
have
be
fetch
over
to
help
the
gaul
in
the
war
against
him
---
he
resolve
,
as
he
be
so
near
,
to
come
and
conquer
Britain
next
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Julius
Caesar
come
sail
over
to
this
Island
of
our
,
with
eighty
vessel
and
twelve
thousand
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
come
from
the
french
coast
between
Calais
and
Boulogne
,
"
because
thence
be
the
short
passage
into
Britain
;
"
just
for
the
same
reason
as
our
steam
-
boat
now
take
the
same
track
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
expect
to
conquer
Britain
easily
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
such
easy
work
as
he
suppose
---
for
the
bold
Britons
fight
most
bravely
;
and
,
what
with
not
have
his
horse
-
soldier
with
him
(
for
they
have
be
drive
back
by
a
storm
)
,
and
what
with
have
some
of
his
vessel
dash
to
piece
by
a
high
tide
after
they
be
draw
ashore
,
he
run
great
risk
of
be
totally
defeat
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
for
once
that
the
bold
Britons
beat
him
,
he
beat
them
twice
;
though
not
so
soundly
but
that
he
be
very
glad
to
accept
their
proposal
of
peace
,
and
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
spring
of
the
next
year
,
he
come
back
;
this
time
,
with
eight
hundred
vessel
and
thirty
thousand
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
british
tribe
choose
,
as
their
general
-
in
-
chief
,
a
Briton
,
whom
the
Romans
in
their
latin
language
call
CASSIVELLAUNUS
,
but
whose
british
name
be
suppose
to
have
be
CASWALLON
.
 
<EOS>
a
brave
general
he
be
,
and
well
he
and
his
soldier
fight
the
roman
army
!
 
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
whenever
in
that
war
the
roman
soldier
see
a
great
cloud
of
dust
,
and
hear
the
rattle
of
the
rapid
british
chariot
,
they
tremble
in
their
heart
.
 
<EOS>
besides
a
number
of
small
battle
,
there
be
a
battle
fight
near
Canterbury
,
in
Kent
;
there
be
a
battle
fight
near
Chertsey
,
in
Surrey
;
there
be
a
battle
fight
near
a
marshy
little
town
in
a
wood
,
the
capital
of
that
part
of
Britain
which
belong
to
CASSIVELLAUNUS
,
and
which
be
probably
near
what
be
now
Saint
Albans
,
in
Hertfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
brave
CASSIVELLAUNUS
have
the
bad
of
it
,
on
the
whole
;
though
he
and
his
man
always
fight
like
lion
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
other
british
chief
be
jealous
of
him
,
and
be
always
quarrel
with
him
,
and
with
one
another
,
he
give
up
,
and
propose
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Julius
Caesar
be
very
glad
to
grant
peace
easily
,
and
to
go
away
again
with
all
his
remain
ship
and
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
to
find
pearl
in
Britain
,
and
he
may
have
find
a
few
for
anything
I
know
;
but
,
at
all
event
,
he
find
delicious
oyster
,
and
I
be
sure
he
find
tough
Britons
---
of
whom
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
he
make
the
same
complaint
as
Napoleon
Bonaparte
the
great
French
General
do
,
eighteen
hundred
year
afterwards
,
when
he
say
they
be
such
unreasonable
fellow
that
they
never
know
when
they

there

They

come
,
in
pirate
ship
,
to
the
sea
-
coast
of
Gaul
and
Britain
,
and
to
plunder
them

<EOS>
They

repulse
by
CARAUSIUS
,
a
native
either
of
Belgium
or
of
Britain

who
be
appoint

Romans
to
the
command

and
under
whom
the
Britons
first
begin
to
fight
upon
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
after
this
time
,
they
renew
their
ravage
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
year
more
,
and
the
Scots
(
which
be
then
the
name
for
the
people
of
Ireland

,
and
the
Picts
,
a
northern
people
,
begin

make
frequent
plundering
incursion
into
the
South
of
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
attack
be
repeat
,
at
interval
,
during
two
hundred
year
,
and
through
a
long
succession
of
Roman
Emperors
and
chief
;
during
all
which
length
of
time
,
the
Britons
rise
against
the
Romans
,
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
in
the
day
of
the
roman
HONORIUS
,
when
the
roman
power
all
over
the
world
be
fast
decline
,
and
when
Rome
want
all
her
soldier
at
home
,
the
Romans
abandon
all
hope
of
conquer
Britain
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
and
still
,
at
last
,
as
at
first
,
the
Britons
rise
against
them
,
in
their
old
brave
manner
;
for
,
a
very
little
while
before
,
they
have
turn
away
the
roman
magistrate
,
and
declare
themselves
an
independent
people
.
  
<EOS>
five
hundred
year
have
pass
,
since
Julius
Caesar
's
first
invasion
of
the
Island
,
when
the
Romans
depart
from
it
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
that
time
,
although
they
have
be
the
cause
of
terrible
fighting
and
bloodshed
,
they
have
do
much
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
Britons
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
make
great
military
road
;
they
have
build
fort
;
they
have
teach
them
how
to
dress
,
and
arm
themselves
,
much
well
than
they
have
ever
know
how
to
do
before
;
they
have
refine
the
whole
british
way
of
living
.
 
<EOS>
AGRICOLA
have
build
a
great
wall
of
earth
,
more
than
seventy
mile
long
,
extend
from
Newcastle
to
beyond
Carlisle
,
for
the
purpose
of
keep
out
the
Picts
and
Scots
;
HADRIAN
have
strengthen
it
;
SEVERUS
,
find
it
much
in
want
of
repair
,
have
build
it
afresh
of
stone
.
  
<EOS>
above
all
,
it
be
in
the
roman
time
,
and
by
mean
of
roman
ship
,
that
the
Christian
Religion
be
first
bring
into
Britain
,
and
its
people
first
teach
the
great
lesson
that
,
to
be
good
in
the
sight
of
GOD
,
they
must
love
their
neighbour
as
themselves
,
and
do
unto
other
as
they
would
be
do
by
.
 
<EOS>
the
Druids
declare
that
it
be
very
wicked
to
believe
in
any
such
thing
,
and
curse
all
the
people
who
do
believe
it
,
very
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
people
find
that
they
be
none
the
well
for
the
blessing
of
the
Druids
,
and
none
the
bad
for
the
curse
of
the
Druids
,
but
,
that
the
sun
shone
and
the
rain
fall
without
consult
the
Druids
at
all
,
they
just
begin
to
think
that
the
Druids
be
mere
man
,
and
that
it
signify
very
little
whether
they
curse
or
bless
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
,
the
pupil
of
the
Druids
fall
off
greatly
in
number
,
and
the
Druids
take
to
other
trade
.
  
<EOS>
thus
I
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
roman
time
in
England

<EOS>
It

Ancient

the

scarcely

begin

never

<EOS>
for
,
the

go

reduce

They

often
for
more
booty
and
more
slaughter

that
the
unfortunate
Britons
live
a
life
of
terror

<EOS>
as
if
the
Picts

Scots
be
not
bad
enough
on
land
,
the
Saxons
attack
the
islander
by
sea

and
,
as

something

want

they
quarrel
bitterly

the

curse
all

<EOS>
so
,
altogether
,
the
Britons
be
very
badly
off
,
you
may
believe

<EOS>
They
be
in
such
distress
,
in
short
,
that
they
send
a
letter
to
Rome
entreat
help
---
which
they
call
the
Groans
of
the
Britons
;
and
in
which
they
say
,
"
the

the

perish

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
Romans
could
not
help
them
,
even
if
they
be
so
inclined
;
for
they
have
enough
to
do
to
defend
themselves
against
their
own
enemy
,
who
be
then
very
fierce

strong

<EOS>
at
last
,
the
Britons
,
unable
to
bear
their
hard
condition
any
longer
,
resolve
to
make
peace
with
the
Saxons
,

to
invite
the
Saxons
to
come
into
their

It

VORTIGERN
,
say
in
a
sweet
voice
,
"
dear
King
,
thy
health
!
"
<EOS>
the
King
fall
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
,
that
the
cunning
HENGIST
mean
him
to
do
so
,
in
order
that
the
Saxons
may
have
great
influence
with
him
;
and
that
the
fair
ROWENA
come
to
that
feast
,
golden
goblet
and
all
,
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
they
be
married
;
and
,
long
afterwards
,
whenever
the
King
be
angry
with
the
Saxons
,
or
jealous
of
their
encroachment
,
ROWENA
would
put
her
beautiful
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
softly
say
,
"
dear
King
,
they
be
my
people
!
 
<EOS>
be
favourable
to
them
,
as
you
love
that
Saxon
girl
who
give
you
the
golden
goblet
of
wine
at
the
feast
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
,
really
,
I
do
not
see
how
the
King
could
help
himself
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
We
must
all
die
!
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
year
,
VORTIGERN
die
---
he
be
dethrone
,
and
put
in
prison
,
first
,
I
be
afraid
;
and
ROWENA
die
;
and
generation
of
Saxons
and
Britons
die
;
and
event
that
happen
during
a
long
,
long
time
,
would
have
be
quite
forget
but
for
the
tale
and
song
of
the
old
Bards
,
who
use
to
go
about
from
feast
to
feast
,
with
their
white
beard
,
recount
the
deed
of
their
forefather
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
history
of
which
they
sing

there
be
a
famous
one

concern
the
bravery
and
virtue
of
KING

suppose
to
have
be
a
british
Prince

,
whether
such

there
be
several

come
to
be
confuse
together
under

whether
all
about

no

I

most
interesting

They

quite

They

one

himself

here

be
at

with
which
he
hope
to
punish
the
false

when
a
bright

should
come

think
deeply
of
his

the

at

a

like

I
think

<EOS>
the
loss
of
their
standard
trouble
the

greatly

for
they

it
to
be
enchant

weave
by
the
three
daughter

father

afternoon

they

victorious
in

the

stretch
his
wing

seem
to
fly

defeat

He
have
good
reason
to
droop

now

if
he
could
have
do
anything
half
so
sensible

for
,
KING

danish
camp
.
 
<EOS>
He
play
and
sing
in
the
very
tent
of
GUTHRUM
the
danish
leader
,
and
entertain
the
Danes
as
they
carouse
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
seem
to
think
of
nothing
but
his
music
,
he
be
watchful
of
their
tent
,
their
arm
,
their
discipline
,
everything
that
he
desire
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
and
right
soon
do
this
great
king
entertain
them
to
a
different
tune
;
for
,
summon
all
his
true
follower
to
meet
him
at
an
appoint
place
,
where
they
receive
him
with
joyful
shout
and
tear
,
as
the
monarch
whom
many
of
them
have
give
up
for
lost
or
dead
,
he
put
himself
at
their
head
,
march
on
the
danish
camp
,
defeat
the
Danes
with
great
slaughter
,
and
besiege
them
for
fourteen
day
to
prevent
their
escape
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
be
as
merciful
as
he
be
good
and
brave
,
he
then
,
instead
of
kill
them
,
propose
peace
:
 
on
condition
that
they
should
altogether
depart
from
that
western
part
of
England
,
and
settle
in
the
East
;
and
that
GUTHRUM
should
become
a
Christian
,
in
remembrance
of
the
Divine
religion
which
now
teach
his
conqueror
,
the
noble
ALFRED
,
to
forgive
the
enemy
who
have
so
often
injure
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
GUTHRUM
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
his
baptism
,
KING
ALFRED
be
his
godfather
.
 
<EOS>
and
GUTHRUM
be
an
honourable
chief
who
well
deserve
that
clemency
;
for
,
ever
afterwards
he
be
loyal
and
faithful
to
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
the
Danes
under
him
be
faithful
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
plunder
and
burn
no
more
,
but
work
like
honest
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
plough
,
and
sow
,
and
reap
,
and
lead
good
honest
english
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
the
child
of
those
dane
play
,
many
a
time
,
with
Saxon
child
in
the
sunny
field
;
and
that
danish
young
man
fall
in
love
with
Saxon
girl
,
and
marry
them
;
and
that
english
traveller
,
benight
at
the
door
of
danish
cottage
,
often
go
in
for
shelter
until
morning
;
and
that
Danes
and
Saxons
sit
by
the
red
fire
,
friend
,
talk
of
KING
ALFRED
the
GREAT
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
Danes
be
not
like
these
under
guthrum
;
for
,
after
some
year
,
more
of
them
come
over
,
in
the
old
plundering
and
burn
way
---
among
them
a
fierce
pirate
of
the
name
of
HASTINGS
,
who
have
the
boldness
to
sail
up
the
Thames
to
gravesend
,
with
eighty
ship
.
<EOS>
for
three
year
,
there
be
a
war
with
these
Danes
;
and
there
be
a
famine
in
the
country
,
too
,
and
a
plague
,
both
upon
human
creature
and
beast
.
 
<EOS>
but
KING
ALFRED
,
whose
mighty
heart
never
fail
him
,
build
large
ship
nevertheless
,
with
which
to
pursue
the
pirate
on
the
sea
;
and
he
encourage
his
soldier
,
by
his
brave
example
,
to
fight
valiantly
against
them
on
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
drive
them
all
away
;
and
then
there
be
repose
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
as
great
and
good
in
peace
,
as
he
be
great
and
good
in
war
,
KING
ALFRED
never
rest
from
his
labour
to
improve
his
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
love
to
talk
with
clever
man
,
and
with
traveller
from
foreign
country
,
and
to
write
down
what
they
tell
him
,
for
his
people
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
study
Latin
after
learn
to
read
English
,
and
now
another
of
his
labours
be
,
to
translate
latin
book
into
the
English
-
Saxon
tongue
,
that
his
people
may
be
interested
,
and
improve
by
their
content
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
just
law
,
that
they
may
live
more
happily
and
freely
;
he
turn
away
all
partial
judge
,
that
no
wrong
may
be
do
them
;
he
be
so
careful
of
their
property
,
and
punish
robber
so
severely
,
that
it
be
a
common
thing
to
say
that
under
the
great
KING
ALFRED
,
garland
of
golden
chain
and
jewel
may
have
hang
across
the
street
,
and
no
man
would
have
touch
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
school
;
he
patiently
hear
cause
himself
in
his
Court
of
Justice
;
the
great
desire
of
his
heart
be
,
to
do
right
to
all
his
subject
,
and
to
leave
England
better
,
wise
,
happy
in
all
way
,
than
he
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
industry
in
these
effort
be
quite
astonishing
.
 
<EOS>
every
day
he
divide
into
certain
portion
,
and
in
each
portion
devote
himself
to
a
certain
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
may
divide
his
time
exactly
,
he
have
wax
torch
or
candle
make
,
which
be
all
of
the
same
size
,
be
notch
across
at
regular
distance
,
and
be
always
keep
burn
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
as
the
candle
burn
down
,
he
divide
the
day
into
notch
,
almost
as
accurately
as
we
now
divide
it
into
hour
upon
the
clock
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
candle
be
first
invent
,
it
be
find
that
the
wind
and
draught
of
air
,
blow
into
the
palace
through
the
door
and
window
,
and
through
the
chink
in
the
wall
,
cause
them
to
gutter
and
burn
unequally
.
 
<EOS>
to
prevent
this
,
the
King
have
them
put
into
case
form
of
wood
and
white
horn
.
 
<EOS>
and
these
be
the
first
lanthorn
ever
make
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
he
be
afflict
with
a
terrible
unknown
disease
,
which
cause
him
violent
and
frequent
pain
that
nothing
could
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
He
bear
it
,
as
he
have
bear
all
the
trouble
of
his
life
,
like
a
brave
good
man
,
until
he
be
fifty
-
three
year
old
;
and
then
,
have
reign
thirty
year
,
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
die
in
the
year
nine
hundred
and
one
;
but
,
long
ago
as
that
is
,
his
fame
,
and
the
love
and
gratitude
with
which
his
subject
regard
him
,
be
freshly
remember
to
the
present
hour
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
reign
,
which
be
the
reign
of
EDWARD
,
surname
the
ELDER
,
who
be
choose
in
council
to
succeed
,
a
nephew
of
KING
ALFRED
trouble
the
country
by
try
to
obtain
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
the
Danes
in
the
East
of
England
take
part
with
this
usurper
(
perhaps
because
they
have
honour
his
uncle
so
much
,
and
honour
him
for
his
uncle
's
sake
)
,
and
there
be
hard
fighting
;
but
,
the
King
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
sister
,
gain
the
day
,
and
reign
in
peace
for
four
and
twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
He
gradually
extend
his
power
over
the
whole
of
England
,
and
so
the
Seven
Kingdoms
be
unite
into
one
.
  
<EOS>
when
England
thus
become
one
kingdom
,
rule
over
by
one
Saxon
king
,
the
Saxons
have
be
settle
in
the
country
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
year
.
 
<EOS>
great
change
have
take
place
in
its
custom
during
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
Saxons
be
still
greedy
eater
and
great
drinker
,
and
their
feast
be
often
of
a
noisy
and
drunken
kind
;
but
many
new
comfort
and
even
elegance
have
become
know
,
and
be
fast
increase
.

a

the

and

when
his

<EOS>
the
weapon
of
the
Saxons
be
stoutly
make
,
and
among
them
be
a
terrible
iron
hammer
that
give
deadly
blow
,
and
be
long
remember

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the
beauty
of
the
Saxon
woman
fill
all
England
with
a
new
delight
and
grace
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
more
to
tell
of
the
Saxons
yet
,
but
I
stop
to
say
this
now
,
because
under
the
GREAT
ALFRED
,
all
the
good
point
of
the
English
-
Saxon
character
be
first
encouraged
,
and
in
him
first
show
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
the
great
character
among
the
nation
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
wherever
the
descendant
of
the
Saxon
race
have
go
,
have
sail
,
or
otherwise
make
their
way
,
even
to
the
remote
region
of
the
world
,
they
have
be
patient
,
persevere
,
never
to
be
break
in
spirit
,
never
to
be
turn
aside
from
enterprise
on
which
they
have
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
in
Europe
,
Asia
,
Africa
,
America
,
the
whole
world
over
;
in
the
desert
,
in
the
forest
,
on
the
sea
;
scorch
by
a
burn
sun
,
or
freeze
by
ice
that
never
melt
;
the
Saxon
blood
remain
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
Wheresoever
that
race
go
,
there
,
law
,
and
industry
,
and
safety
for
life
and
property
,
and
all
the
great
result
of
steady
perseverance
,
be
certain
to
arise
.
  
<EOS>
I
pause
to
think
with
admiration
,
of
the
noble
king
who
,
in
his
single
person
,
possess
all
the
Saxon
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
whom
misfortune
could
not
subdue
,
whom
prosperity
could
not
spoil
,
whose
perseverance
nothing
could
shake
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
hopeful
in
defeat
,
and
generous
in
success
.
 
<EOS>
who
love
justice
,
freedom
,
truth
,
and
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
who
,
in
his
care
to
instruct
his
people
,
probably
do
more
to
preserve
the
beautiful
old
Saxon
language
,
than
I
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
without
whom
,
the
english
tongue
in
which
I
tell
this
story
may
have
want
half
its
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
say
that
his
spirit
still
inspire
some
of
our
good
english
law
,
so
,
let
you
and
I
pray
that
it
may
animate
our
english
heart
,
at
least
to
this
---
to
resolve
,
when
we
see
any
of
our
fellow
-
creature
leave
in
ignorance
,
that
we
will
do
our
good
,
while
life
be
in
us
,
to
have
them
teach
;
and
to
tell
those
ruler
whose
duty
it
be
to
teach
them
,
and
who
neglect
their
duty
,
that
they
have
profit
very
little
by
all
the
year
that
have
roll
away
since
the
year
nine
hundred
and
one
,
and
that
they
be
far
behind
the
bright
example
of
KING
ALFRED
the
GREAT
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Athelstan
and
the
six
Boy
-
Kings
    
ATHELSTAN

of
Edward
the
Elder
,
succeed
that

<EOS>
He

only
fifteen
year
;
but
he
remember
the
glory
of
his
grandfather
,
the
great
Alfred
,
and
govern
England
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
reduce
the
turbulent
people
of
Wales
,
and
oblige
them
to
pay
him
a
tribute
in
money
,
and
in
cattle
,
and
to
send
him
their
good
hawk
and
hound
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
victorious
over
the
cornish
man
,
who
be
not
yet
quite
under
the
Saxon
government
.
 
<EOS>
He
restore
such
of
the
old
law
as
be
good
,
and
have
fall
into
disuse
;
make
some
wise
new
law
,
and
take
care
of
the
poor
and
weak
.
 
<EOS>
a
strong
alliance
,
make
against
him
by
ANLAF
a
danish
prince
,
CONSTANTINE
King
of
the
Scots
,
and
the
people
of
North
Wales
,
he
break
and
defeat
in
one
great
battle
,
long
famous
for
the
vast
number
slay
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
have
a
quiet
reign
;
the
lord
and
lady
about
him
have
leisure
to
become
polite
and
agreeable
;
and
foreign
prince
be
glad
(
as
they
have
sometimes
be
since
)
to
come
to
England
on
visit
to
the
english
court
.
  
<EOS>
when
Athelstan
die
,
at
forty
-
seven
year
old
,
his
brother
EDMUND
,
who
be
only
eighteen
,
become
king

<EOS>
He
be
the
first
of
six
boy
-
king
,
as
you
will
presently
know
.
  
<EOS>
They
call
him
the
Magnificent
,
because
he
show
a
taste
for
improvement
and
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
beset
by
the
Danes
,
and
have
a
short
and
troubled
reign
,
which
come
to
a
troubled
end
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
,
when
he
be
feast
in
his
hall
,
and
have
eat
much
and
drunk
deep
,
he
see
,
among
the
company
,
a
noted
robber
name
LEOF
,
who
have
be
banish
from
England
.
 
<EOS>
make
very
angry
by
the
boldness
of
this
man
,
the
King
turn
to
his
cup
-
bearer
,
and
say
,
"
there
be
a
robber
sit
at
the
table
yonder
,
who
,
for
his
crime
,
be
an
outlaw
in
the
land
---
a
hunt
wolf
,
whose
life
any
man
may
take
,
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
command
that
robber
to
depart
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
depart
!
"
say
Leof
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
?
"
cry
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
by
the
Lord
!
"
say
Leof
.
 
<EOS>
upon
that
the
King
rise
from
his
seat
,
and
,
make
passionately
at
the
robber
,
and
seize
him
by
his
long
hair
,
try
to
throw
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
robber
have
a
dagger
underneath
his
cloak
,
and
,
in
the
scuffle
,
stab
the
King
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
he
set
his
back
against
the
wall
,
and
fight
so
desperately
,
that
although
he
be
soon
cut
to
piece
by
the
King
's
armed
man
,
and
the
wall
and
pavement
be
splash
with
his
blood
,
yet
it
be
not
before
he
have
kill
and
wound
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
what
rough
live
the
king
of
those
time
lead
,
when
one
of
them
could
struggle
,
half
drunk
,
with
a
public
robber
in
his
own
dining
-
hall
,
and
be
stab
in
presence
of
the
company
who
eat

him
.
  
<EOS>
then
succeed
the
boy

EDRED

who
be
weak

sickly

of
a
strong
mind
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
army
fight
the
Northmen
,
the
Danes

Norwegians
,
or
the
Sea
-
Kings
,
as
they
be
call
,
and
beat
them
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
nine
year
,
Edred
die
,
and
pass
away
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
boy
-
king
EDWY
,
fifteen
year
of
age
;
but
<EOS>
the
real
king
,
who
have
the
real
power
,
be
a
monk
name
DUNSTAN
---
a
clever
priest
,
a
little
mad
,
and
not
a
little
proud
and
cruel
.
  
<EOS>
Dunstan
be
then
Abbot
of
Glastonbury
Abbey
,
whither
the
body
of
King
Edmund
the
Magnificent
be
carry
,
to
be
bury
.
 
<EOS>
while
<EOS>
yet
a
boy
,
he
have
get
out
of
his
bed
one
night
(
be
then
in
a
fever
)
,
and
walk
about
Glastonbury
Church
when
it
be
under
repair
;
and
,
because
he
do
not
tumble
off
some
scaffold
that
be
there
,
and
break
his
neck
,
it
be
report
that
he
have
be
show
over
the
building
by
an
angel
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
also
make
a
harp
that
be
say
to
play
of
itself
---
which
it
very
likely
do
,
as
AEolian
Harps
,
which
be
play
by
the
wind
,
and
be
understand
now
,
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
wonder
he
have
be
once
denounce
by
his
enemy
,
who
be
jealous
of
his
favour
with
the
late
King
Athelstan
,
as
a
magician
;
and
he
have
be
waylay
,
bind
hand
and
foot
,
and
throw
into
a
marsh
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
get
out
again
,
somehow
,
to
cause
a
great
deal
of
trouble
yet
.
  
<EOS>
the
priest
of
those
day
be
,
generally
,
the
only
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
learn
in
many
thing
.
 
<EOS>
have
to
make
their
own
convent
and
monastery
on
uncultivated
ground
that
be
grant
to
them
by
the
Crown
,
it
be
necessary
that
they
should
be
good
farmer
and
good
gardener
,
or
their
land
would
have
be
too
poor
to
support
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
decoration
of
the
chapel
where
they
pray
,
and
for
the
comfort
of
the
refectory
where
they
eat
and
drank
,
it
be
necessary
that
there
should
be
good
carpenter
,
good
smith
,
good
painter
,
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
their
great
safety
in
sickness
and
accident
,
live
alone
by
themselves
in
solitary
place
,
it
be
necessary
that
they
should
study
the
virtue
of
plant
and
herb
,
and
should
know
how
to
dress
cut
,
burn
,
scald
,
and
bruise
,
and
how
to
set
broken
limb
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
teach
themselves
,
and
one
another
,
a
great
variety
of
useful
art
;
and
become
skilful
in
agriculture
,
medicine
,
surgery
,
and
handicraft
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
they
want
the
aid
of
any
little
piece
of
machinery
,
which
would
be
simple
enough
now
,
but
be
marvellous
then
,
to
impose
a
trick
upon
the
poor
peasant
,
they
know
very
well
how
to
make
it
;
and
do
make
it
many
a
time
and
often
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
Abbot
of
Glastonbury
Abbey
,
be
one
of
the
most
sagacious
of
these
monk
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
ingenious
smith
,
and
work
at
a
forge
in
a
little
cell
.
 
<EOS>
this
cell
be
make
too
short
to
admit
of
his
lying
at
full
length
when
he
go
to
sleep
---
as
if
that
do
any
good
to
anybody
!
<EOS>
---
and
he
use
to
tell
the
most
extraordinary
lie
about
demon
and
spirit
,
who
,
he
say
,
come
there
to
persecute
him
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
he
relate
that
one
day
when
he
be
at
work
,
the
devil
look
in
at
the
little
window
,
and
try
to
tempt
him
to
lead
a
life
of
idle
pleasure
;
whereupon
,
have
his
pincer
in
the
fire
,
red
hot
,
he
seize
the
devil
by
the
nose
,
and
put
him
to
such
pain
,
that
his
bellowing
be
hear
for
mile
and
mile
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
be
inclined
to
think
this
nonsense
a
part
of
Dunstan
's
madness
(
for
his
head
never
quite
recover
the
fever
)
,
but
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
that
it
induce
the
ignorant
people
to
consider
him
a
holy
man
,
and
that
it
make
him
very
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
exactly
what
he
always
want
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
of
the
coronation
of
the
handsome
boy
-
king
Edwy
,
it
be
remark
by
ODO
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
(
who
be
a
dane
by
birth
)
,
that
the
King
quietly
leave
the
coronation
feast
,
while
all
the
company
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Odo
,
much
displeased
,
send
his
friend
Dunstan
to
seek
him
.
 
<EOS>
dunstan
find
him
in
the
company
of
his
beautiful
young
wife
ELGIVA
,
and
her
mother
ETHELGIVA
,
a
good
and
virtuous
lady
,
not
only
grossly
abuse
them
,
but
drag
the
young
King
back
into
the
feasting
-
hall
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
some
,
again
,
think
Dunstan
do
this
because
the
young
King
's
fair
wife
be
his
own
cousin
,
and
the
monk
object
to
people
marry
their
own
cousin
;
but
I
believe
he
do
it
,
because
he
be
an
imperious
,
audacious
,
ill
-
condition
priest
,
who
,
have
love
a
young
lady
himself
before
he
become
a
sour
monk
,
hate
all
love
now
,
and
everything
belong
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
King
be
quite
old
enough
to
feel
this
insult
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
have
be
Treasurer
in
the
last
reign
,
and
he
soon
charge
Dunstan
with
have
take
some
of
the
last
king
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
Glastonbury
Abbot
flee
to
Belgium
(
very
narrowly
escape
some
pursuer
who
be
send
to
put
out
his
eye
,
as
you
will
wish
they
have
,
when
you
read
what
follow
)
,
and
his
abbey
be
give
to
priest
who
be
marry
;
whom
he
always
,
both
before
and
afterwards
,
oppose
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
quickly
conspire
with
his
friend
,
Odo
the
Dane
,
to
set
up
the
King
's
young
brother
,
EDGAR
,
as
his
rival
for
the
throne
;
and
,
not
content
with
this
revenge
,
he
cause
the
beautiful
queen
Elgiva
,
though
a
lovely
girl
of
only
seventeen
or
eighteen
,
to
be
steal
from
one
of
the
Royal
Palaces
,
brand
in
the
cheek
with
a
red
-
hot
iron
,
and
sell
into
slavery
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
irish
people
pity
and
befriend
her
;
and
they
say
,
"
let
us
restore
the
girl
-
queen
to
the
boy
-
king
,
and
make
the
young
lover
happy
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
cure
her
of
her
cruel
wound
,
and
send
her
home
as
beautiful
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
villain
Dunstan
,
and
that
other
villain
,
Odo
,
cause
her
to
be
waylay
at
Gloucester
as
she
be
joyfully
hurrying
to
join
her
husband
,
and
to
be
hack
and
hew
with
sword
,
and
to
be
barbarously
maim
and
lame
,
and
leave
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
when
Edwy
the
Fair
(
his
people
call
him
so
,
because
he
be
so
young
and
handsome
)
<EOS>
hear
of
her
dreadful
fate
,
he
die
of
a
broken
heart
;
and
so
the
pitiful
story
of
the
poor
young
wife
and
husband
end
!
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
better
to
be
two
cottager
in
these
well
time
,
than
king
and
queen
of
England
in
those
bad
day
,
though
never
so
fair
!
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
boy
-
king
,
EDGAR
,
call
the
Peaceful
,
fifteen
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
be
still
the
real
king
,
drive
all
married
priest
out
of
the
monastery
and
abbey
,
and
replace
them
by
solitary
monk
like
himself
,
of
the
rigid
order
call
the
Benedictines
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
himself
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
for
his
great
glory
;
and
exercise
such
power
over
the
neighbouring
british
prince
,
and
so
collect
them
about
the
King
,
that
once
,
when
the
King
hold
his
court
at
Chester
,
and
go
on
the
river
Dee
to
visit
the
monastery
of
St
John
,
the
eight
oar
of
his
boat
be
pull
(
as
the
people
use
to
delight
in
relate
in
story
and
song
)
by
eight
crown
king
,
and
steer
by
the
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
as
Edgar
be
very
obedient
to
Dunstan
and
the
monk
,
they
take
great
pain
to
represent
him
as
the
good
of
king
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
really
profligate
,
debauch
,
and
vicious
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
forcibly
carry
off
a
young
lady
from
the
convent
at
Wilton
;
and
Dunstan
,
pretend
to
be
very
much
shocked
,
condemn
him
not
to
wear
his
crown
upon
his
head
for
seven
year
---
no
great
punishment
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
as
it
can
hardly
have
be
a
more
comfortable
ornament
to
wear
,
than
a
stewpan
without
a
handle
.
 
<EOS>
His
marriage
with
his
second
wife
,
ELFRIDA
,
be
one
of
the
bad
event
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
hearing
of
the
beauty
of
this
lady
,
he
despatch
his
favourite
courtier
,
ATHELWOLD
,
to
her
father
's
castle
in
Devonshire
,
to
see
if
she
be
really
as
charming
as
fame
report
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
she
be
so
exceedingly
beautiful
that
Athelwold
fall
in
love
with
her
himself
,
and
marry
her
;
but
he
tell
the
King
that
she
be
only
rich
---
not
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
suspect
the
truth
when
they
come
home
,
resolve
to
pay
the
newly
-
marry
couple
a
visit
;
and
,
suddenly
,
tell
Athelwold
to
prepare
for
his
immediate
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Athelwold
,
terrify
,
confess
to
his
young
wife
what
he
have
say
and
do
,
and
implore
her
to
disguise
her
beauty
by
some
ugly
dress
or
silly
manner
,
that
he
may
be
safe
from
the
King
's
anger
.
 
<EOS>
She
promise
that
she
would
;
but
she
be
a
proud
woman
,
who
would
far
rather
have
be
a
queen
than
the
wife
of
a
courtier
.
 
<EOS>
She
dress
herself
in
her
good
dress
,
and
adorn
herself
with
her
rich
jewel
;
and
when
the
King
come
,
presently
,
he
discover
the
cheat
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
cause
his
false
friend
,
Athelwold
,
to
be
murder
in
a
wood
,
and
marry
his
widow
,
this
bad
Elfrida
.
 
<EOS>
six
or
seven
year
afterwards
,
he
die
;
and
be
bury
,
as
if
he
have
be
all
that
the
monk
say
he
be
,
in
the
abbey
of
Glastonbury
,
which
he
---
or
Dunstan
for
him
---
have
much
enrich
.
  
<EOS>
England
,
in
one
part
of
this
reign
,
be
so
troubled
by
wolf
,
which
,
drive
out
of
the
open
country
,
hide
themselves
in
the
mountain
of
Wales
when
they

on
condition
of
their

,
every

,
three
hundred

<EOS>
and
the
Welshmen
be
so
sharp
upon
the
wolf
,
to
save
their
money
,
that
in
four
year
there
be
not
a
wolf

<EOS>
then
come
the
boy

call
the
Martyr

from
the
manner

his
death

<EOS>
Elfrida

<EOS>
the

when

gallop
to
the

where
he
arrive
at

<EOS>
"
You

"

<EOS>
"
not

"
My

and
so

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Elfrida
,
go
in
to
bring
the
wine
,
whisper
an
armed
servant
,
one
of
her
attendant

who
steal
out
of
the
darkening
gateway
,
and
creep
round
behind
the
King

<EOS>
as
the
King
raise
the
cup
to
his

,
say
,
"
Health

<EOS>
to
the
wicked
woman
who
be

on
him
,
and
to
his
innocent
brother
whose
hand
she
hold
in
hers
,
and
who
be
only
ten
year
old
,
this
armed
man
make
a
spring
and
stab
him
in
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
drop
the
cup
and
spur
his
horse
away
;
but
,
soon
faint
with
loss
of
blood
,
drop
from
the
saddle
,
and
,
in
his
fall
,
entangle
one
of
his
foot
in
the
stirrup

<EOS>
the
frightened
horse
dash
on
;
trail
his
rider
's
curl
upon
the
ground
;
drag
his
smooth
young
face
through
rut
,
and
stone
,
and
brier
,
and
fall
leave

and
mud
;
until
the
hunter

track
the
animal

course
by
the
King
's
blood
,
catch
his
bridle
,
and
release
the
disfigured
body
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
sixth
and
last
of
the
boy
-
king
,
ETHELRED
,
whom
Elfrida
,
when
he
cry
out
at
the
sight
of
his
murder
brother
ride
away
from
the
castle
gate
,
unmercifully
beat
with
a
torch
which
she
snatch
from
one
of
the
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
so
dislike
this
boy
,
on
account
of
his
cruel
mother
and
the
murder
she
have
do
to
promote
him
,
that
Dunstan
would
not
have
have
him
for
king
,
but
would
have
make
EDGITHA
,
the
daughter
of
the
dead
King
Edgar
,
and
of
the
lady
whom
he
steal
out
of
the
convent
at
Wilton
,
Queen
of
England
,
if
she
would
have
consent
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
know
the
story
of
the
youthful
king
too
well
,
and
would
not
be
persuade
from
the
convent
where
she
live
in
peace
;
so
,
Dunstan
put
ethelre
on
the
throne
,
have
no
one
else
to
put
there
,
and
give
him
the
nickname
of
the
UNREADY
---
know
that
he
want
resolution
and
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
Elfrida
possess
great
influence
over
the
young
King
,
but
,
as
he
grow
old
and
come
of
age

<EOS>
the
infamous
woman
,
not
have
it
in
her
power
to
do
any
more
evil
,
then
retire
from
court
,
and
,
accord
,
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
,
build
church
and
monastery
,
to
expiate
her
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
a
church
,
with
a
steeple
reach
to
the
very
star
,
would
have
be
any
sign
of
true
repentance
for
the
blood
of
the
poor
boy
,
whose
murder
form
be
trail
at
his
horse
's
heel

<EOS>
as
if
she
could
have
bury
her
wickedness
beneath
the
senseless
stone
of
the
whole
world
,
pile
up
one
upon
another
,
for
the
monk
to
live
in

<EOS>
about
the
ninth
or
tenth
year
of
this
reign
,
Dunstan
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
grow
old
then
,
but
be
as
stern
and
artful
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
two
circumstance
that
happen
in
connexion
with
him
,
in
this
reign
of
ethelre
,
make
a
great
noise
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
he
be
present
at
a
meeting
of
the
Church
,
when
the
question
be
discuss
whether
priest
should
have
permission
to
marry
;
and
,
as
he
sit
with
his
head
hang
down
,
apparently
think
about
it
,
a
voice
seem
to
come
out
of
a
crucifix
in
the
room
,
and
warn
the
meeting
to
be
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
this
be
some
juggling
of
Dunstan
's
,
and
be
probably
his
own
voice
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
play
off
a
bad
juggle
than
that
,
soon
afterwards
;
for
,
another
meeting
be
hold
on
the
same
subject
,
and
he
and
his
supporter
be
seat
on
one
side
of
a
great
room
,
and
their
opponent
on
the
other
,
he
rise
and
say
,
"
to
Christ
himself
,
as
judge
,
do
I
commit
this
cause
!
"
 
<EOS>
immediately
on
these
word
be
speak
,
the
floor
where
the
opposite
party
sit
give
way
,
and
some
be
kill
and
many
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
pretty
sure
that
it
have
be
weaken
under
Dunstan
's
direction
,
and
that
it
fall
at
Dunstan
's
signal
.
 
<EOS>
his
part
of
the
floor
do
not
go
down
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
good
a
workman
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
die
,
the
monk
settle
that
he
be
a
Saint
,
and
call
him
Saint
Dunstan
ever
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
just
as
well
have
settle
that
he
be
a
coach
-
horse
,
and
could
just
as
easily
have
call
him
one
.
  
<EOS>
ethelre
the
Unready
be
glad
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
to
be
rid
of
this
holy
saint
;
but
,
leave
to
himself
,
he
be
a
poor
weak
king
,
and
his
reign
be
a
reign
of
defeat
and
shame
.
 
<EOS>
the
restless
Danes
,
lead
by
SWEYN
,
a
son
of
the
King
of
Denmark
who
have
quarrel
with
his
father
and
have
be
banish
from
home
,
again
come
into
England
,
and
,
year
after
year
,
attack
and
despoil
large
town
.
 
<EOS>
to
coax
these
sea
-
king
away
,
the
weak
Ethelred
pay
them
money
;
but
,
the
more
money
he
pay
,
the
more
money
the
Danes
want
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
give
them
ten
thousand
pound
;
on
their
next
invasion
,
sixteen
thousand
pound
;
on
their
next
invasion
,
four
and
twenty
thousand
pound
:
 
to
pay
which
large
sum
,
the
unfortunate
english
people
be
heavily
tax
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
Danes
still
come
back
and
want
more
,
he
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
marry
into
some
powerful
foreign
family
that
would
help
him
with
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
and
two
,
he
court
and
marry
Emma
,
the
sister
of
Richard
Duke
of
Normandy
;
a
lady
who
be
call
the
Flower
of
Normandy

<EOS>
and
now
,
a
terrible
deed
be
do
in

<EOS>
the
like
of

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
young

<EOS>
no

there
be
among

many
ferocious

and
whose
pride

insolence
,
in
swagger
in
the
house
of
the
English
and
insult
their
wife
and
daughter

have
become
unbearable

but
no
doubt
there
be
also
among
them
many
peaceful
christian
Danes
who
have
marry
english

and
become
like

<EOS>
They

and
in

<EOS>
there
be
but
one
man
of
note
,
at
this
miserable
pass
,
who
be
true
to
his
country
and
the
feeble
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
priest
,
and
a
brave
one
.
 
<EOS>
for
twenty
day
,
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury

that
city
against
its
danish
besieger
;
and
when
a
traitor
in
the
town
throw
the
gate
open
and
admit
them
,
he
say
,
in

,
"
I

<EOS>
do

me
what

"
 
<EOS>
again
and
again
,
he
steadily
refuse
to
purchase
his
release
with
gold
wrung
from
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
Danes
be
tired
of
this
,
and
be
assemble
at
a
drunken
merry
-
making
,
have
him
bring
into
the
feasting

hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
bishop
,
"
they
say
,
"
we
want
gold
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
round
on
the
crowd
of
angry
face
;
from
the
shaggy
beard
close
to
him
,
to
the
shaggy
beard
against
the
wall
,
where
man
be
mount
on
table
and
form
to
see
him
over
the
head
of
other

and
he
know
that
his
time
be
come

<EOS>
"
I
have

he

<EOS>
"

"
they

"
that

say
he
.
  
<EOS>
They
gather
close
round
him
,
threaten
,
but
he
stand
unmoved
.
<EOS>
then
,
one
man
strike
him
;
then
,
another
;
then
a
cursing
soldier
pick
up
from
a
heap
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
,
where
fragment
have
be
rudely
throw
at
dinner
,
a
great
ox
-
bone
,
and
cast
it
at
his
face
,
from
which
the
blood
come
spurt
forth
;
then
,
other
run
to
the
same
heap
,
and
knock
him
down
with
other
bone
,
and
bruise
and
batter
him
;
until
one
soldier
whom
he
have
baptise
(
willing

as
I
hope
for
the
sake
of
that
soldier
's
soul
,
to
shorten
the
suffering
of
the
good
man

strike
him
dead
with
his
battle

<EOS>
if
ethelre
have
have
the
heart
to
emulate
the
courage
of
this
noble
archbishop
,
he
may
have
do
something
yet
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
pay
the
Danes
forty
-
eight
thousand
pound
,
instead
,
and
gain
so
little
by
the
cowardly
act
,
that
Sweyn
soon
afterwards
come
over
to
subdue
all
England
.
 
<EOS>
so
broken
be
the
attachment
of
the
english
people
,
by
this
time
,
to
their
incapable
king
and
their
forlorn
country
which
could
not
protect
them
,
that
they
welcome
sweyn
on
all
side
,
as
a
deliverer
.
 
<EOS>
London
faithfully
stand
out
,
as
long
as
the
King
be
within
its
wall
;
but
,
when
he
sneak
away
,
it
also
welcome
the
Dane
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
all
be
over
;
and
the
King
take
refuge
abroad
with
the
Duke
of
Normandy
,
who
have
already
give
shelter
to
the
King
's
wife
,
once
the
Flower
of
that
country
,
and
to
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
the
english
people
,
in
spite
of
their
sad
suffering
,
could
not
quite
forget
the
great
King
Alfred
and
the
Saxon
race
.
 
<EOS>
when
Sweyn
die
suddenly
,
in
little
more
than
a
month
after
he
have
be
proclaim
King
of
England
,
they
generously
send
to
Ethelred
,
to
say
that
they
would
have
him
for
their
King
again
,
"
if
he
would
only
govern
them
better
than
he
have
govern
them
before

"
 
<EOS>
the
Unready
,
instead
of
come
himself
,
send
Edward
,
one
of
his
son
,
to
make
promise
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
follow

and
the
English
declare
him
King

<EOS>
the
Danes
declare
CANUTE

thus
,
direful

begin
again
,
and
last
for
three
year
,
when
the
Unready

<EOS>
and
I
know
of
nothing
well
that
he
do

in
all
his
reign
of
eight

thirty
year

<EOS>
be
Canute
to
be
King
now
?
 
<EOS>
not
over
the
saxon

they

they
must
have
EDMUND

one
of
the
son

IRONSIDE

because
of
his
strength

Edmund

thereupon
fall
to

five
battle

England

<EOS>
what
a
fighting

ground
it
be

and
then
Ironside

who
be

propose
to
Canute
,
who
be
a
little
man

that
they
two
should
fight
it
out
in
single
combat

<EOS>
if
Canute
have
be
the
big
man
,
he
would
probably
have
say
yes
,
but
,
be
the
little
man
,
he
decidedly
say
no
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
declare
that
he
be
willing
to
divide
the
kingdom
---
to
take
all
that
lie
north

Watling

roman
military
road
from
Dover

of
it

<EOS>
Most
man
be
weary
of
so
much
bloodshed
,
this
be
do

<EOS>
but
Canute
soon
become
sole
King
of
England
;
for
Ironside
die
suddenly
within
two
month

<EOS>
some
think
that
he

no

he
be
so

their
uncle
the
Duke
<EOS>
may
one
day
claim
the
crown
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
show
so
little
inclination
to
do
so
now
,
that
he
propose
to
Canute
to
marry
his
sister
,
the
widow
of
the
Unready
;
who
,
be
but
a
showy
flower
,
and
care
for
nothing
so
much
as
become
a
queen
again
,
leave
her
child
and
be
wed
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
successful
and
triumphant
,
assist
by
the
valour
of
the
English
in
his
foreign
war
,
and
with
little
strife
to
trouble
him
at
home
,
Canute
have
a
prosperous
reign
,
and
make
many
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
poet
and
a
musician
.
 
<EOS>
He
grow
sorry
,
as
he
grow
old
,
for
the
blood
he
have
shed
at
first
;
and
go
to
Rome
in
a
Pilgrim
's
dress
,
by
way
of
wash
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
a
great
deal
of
money
to
foreigner
on
his
journey
;
but
he
take
it
from
the
English
before
he
start
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
however
,
he
certainly
become
a
far
well
man
when
he
have
no
opposition
to
contend
with
,
and
be
as
great
a
King
as
England
have
know
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
writer
of
history
relate
how
that
Canute
be
one
day
disgust
with
his
courtier
for
their
flattery
,
and
how
he
cause
his
chair
to
be
set
on
the
sea
-
shore
,
and
feign
to
command
the
tide
as
it
come
up
not
to
wet
the
edge
of
his
robe
,
for
the
land
be
his
;
how
the
tide
come
up
,
of
course
,
without
regard
him
;
and
how
he
then
turn
to
his
flatterer
,
and
rebuke
them
,
say
,
what
be
the
might
of
any
earthly
king
,
to
the
might
of
the
Creator
,
who
could
say
unto
the
sea
,
"
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
,
and
no
farther
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
may
learn
from
this
,
I
think
,
that
a
little
sense
will
go
a
long
way
in
a
king
;
and
that
courtier
be
not
easily
cure
of
flattery
,
nor
king
of
a
liking
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
courtier
of
Canute
have
not
know
,
long
before
,
that
the
King
be
fond
of
flattery
,
they
would
have
know
better
than
to
offer
it
in
such
large
dose
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
they
have
not
know
that
he
be
vain
of
this
speech
(
anything
but
a
wonderful
speech
it
seem
to
me
,
if
a
good
child
have
make
it
)
,
they
would
not
have
be
at
such
great
pain
to
repeat
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
see
them
all
on
the
sea
-
shore
together
;
the
King
's
chair
sink
in
the
sand
;
the
King
in
a
mighty
good
humour
with
his
own
wisdom
;
and
the
courtier
pretend
to
be
quite
stunned
by
it
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
sea
alone
that
be
bidden
to
go
"
thus
far
,
and
no
farther
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
great
command
go
forth
to
all
the
king
upon
the
earth
,
and
go
to
Canute
in
the
year
one
thousand
and
thirty
-
five
,
and
stretch
him
dead
upon
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
beside
it
,
stand
his
Norman
wife
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
as
the
King
look
his
last
upon
her
,
he
,
who
have
so
often
think
distrustfully
of
Normandy
,
long
ago
,
think
once
more
of
the
two
exile
Princes
in
their
uncle
's
court
,
and
of
the
little
favour
they
could
feel
for
either
Danes
or
Saxons
,
and
of
a
rise
cloud
in
Normandy
that
slowly
move
towards
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Harold
Harefoot
,
Hardicanute
,
and
Edward
the
Confessor
    
CANUTE
leave
three
son
,
by
name
SWEYN
,
HAROLD
,
and
HARDICANUTE
;
but
his
Queen
,
Emma
,
once
the
Flower
of
Normandy
,
be
the
mother
of
only
Hardicanute
.
 
<EOS>
Canute
have
wish
his
dominion
to
be
divide
between
the
three
,
and
have
wish
Harold
to
have
England
;
but
the
Saxon
people
in
the
South
of
England
,
head
by
a
nobleman
with
great
possession
,
call
the
powerful
EARL
GODWIN
(
who
be
say
to
have
be
originally
a
poor
cow
-
boy
)
,
oppose
this
,
and
desire
to
have
,
instead
,
either
Hardicanute
,
or
one
of
the
two
exile
Princes
who
be
over
in
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
so
certain
that
there
would
be
more
bloodshe
to
settle
this
dispute
,
that
many
people
leave
their
home
,
and
take
refuge
in
the
wood
and
swamp
.
 
<EOS>
happily
,
however
,
it
be
agree
to
refer
the
whole
question
to
a
great
meeting
at
Oxford
,
which
decide
that
Harold
should
have
all
the
country
north
of
the
Thames
,
with
London
for
his
capital
city
,
and
that
Hardicanute
should
have
all
the
south
.
 
<EOS>
the
quarrel
be
so
arrange
;
and
,
as
Hardicanute
be
in
Denmark
troubling
himself
very
little
about
anything
but
eat
and
get
drunk
,
his
mother
and
Earl
Godwin
<EOS>
govern
the
south
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
hardly
begin
to
do
so
,
and
the
tremble
people
who
have
hide
themselves
be
scarcely
at
home
again
,
when
Edward
,
the
elder
of
the
two
exile
Princes
,
come
over
from
Normandy
with
a
few
follower
,
to
claim
the
English
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
Emma
,
however
,
who
only
care
for
her
last
son
Hardicanute
,
instead
of
assist
him
,
as
he
expect
,
oppose
him
so
strongly
with
all
her
influence
that
he
be
very
soon
glad
to
get
safely
back
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
Alfred
be
not
so
fortunate
.
 
<EOS>
believe
in
an
affectionate
letter
,
write
some
time
afterwards
to
him
and
his
brother
,
in
his
mother
's
name
(
but
whether
really
with
or
without
his
mother
's
knowledge
be
now
uncertain
)
,
he
allow
himself
to
be
tempt
over
to
England
,
with
a
good
force
of
soldier
,
and
landing
on
the
kentish
coast
,
and
be
meet
and
welcome
by
Earl
Godwin
,
proceed
into
Surrey
,
as
far
as
the
town
of
Guildford
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
he
and
his
man
halt
in
the
evening
to
rest
,
have
still
the
Earl
in
their
company
;
who
have
order
lodging
and
good
cheer
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
when
they
be
off
their
guard
,
be
divide
into
small
party
sleep
soundly
after
a
long
march
and
a
plentiful
supper
in
different
house
,
they
be
set
upon
by
the
King
's
troop
,
and
take
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
they
be
draw
out
in
a
line
,
to
the
number
of
six
hundred
man
,
and
be
barbarously
torture
and
kill
;
with
the
exception
of
every
tenth
man
,
who
be
sell
into
slavery
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
wretched
Prince
Alfred
,
he
be
strip
naked
,
tie
to
a
horse
and
send
away
into
the
Isle
of
Ely
,
where
his
eye
be
tear
out
of
his
head
,
and
where
in
a
few
day
he
miserably
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
the
Earl
have
wilfully
entrap
him
,
but
I
suspect
it
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
Harold
be
now
King
all
over
England
,
though
it
be
doubtful
whether
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
(
the
great
part
of
the
priest
be
saxon
,
and
not
friendly
to
the
Danes
)
ever
consent
to
crown
him
.
<EOS>
crown
or
uncrowne
,
with
the
Archbishop
's
leave
or
without
it
,
he
be
King
for
four
year
:
 
after
which
short
reign
he
die
,
and
be
bury
;
have
never
do
much
in
life
but
go
a
hunting
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
fast
runner
at
this
,
his
favourite
sport
,
that
the
people
call
him
Harold
Harefoot
.
  
<EOS>
Hardicanute
be
then
at
bruge
,
in
flander
,
plot
,
with
his
mother
(
who
have
go
over
there
after
the
cruel
murder
of
Prince
Alfred
)
,
for
the
invasion
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
Danes
and
Saxons
,
find
themselves
without
a
king
,
and
dread
new
dispute
,
make
common
cause
,
and
join
in
invite
him
to
occupy
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
He
consent
,
and
soon
trouble
them
enough
;
for
he
bring
over
number
of
dane
,
and
tax
the
people
so
insupportably
to
enrich
those
greedy
favourite
that
there
be
many
insurrection
,
especially
one
at
Worcester
,
where
the
citizen
rise
and
kill
his
tax
-
collector
;
in
revenge
for
which
he
burn
their
city
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
brutal
King
,
whose
first
public
act
be
to
order
the
dead
body
of
poor
Harold
Harefoot
to
be
dig
up
,
behead
,
and
throw
into
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
His
end
be
worthy
of
such
a
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
He
fall
down
drunk
,
with
a
goblet
of
wine
in
his
hand
,
at

feast
at
Lambeth
,

TOWED

and
he
never

again
.
  
<EOS>
EDWARD
,
afterwards
call
by
the
monk
the
confessor
,
succeed
;
and
his
first
act
be
to
oblige
his
mother
Emma
,
who
have
favour
him
so
little
,
to
retire
into
the
country
;
where
she
die
some
ten
year
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
exile
prince
whose
brother
Alfred
have
be
so
foully
kill
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
invite
over
from
Normandy
by
Hardicanute
,
in
the
course
of
his
short
reign
of
two
year
,
and
have
be
handsomely
treat
at
court
.
 
<EOS>
His
cause
be
now
favour
by
the
powerful
Earl
Godwin
,
and
he
be
soon
make
King
.
 
<EOS>
this
Earl
have
be
suspect
by
the
people
,
ever
since
Prince
Alfred
's
cruel
death
;
he
have
even
be
try
in
the
last
reign
for
the
Prince
's
murder
,
but
have
be
pronounce
not
guilty
;
chiefly
,
as
it
be
suppose
,
because
of
a
present
he
have
make
to
the
swinish
King
,
of
a
gilded
ship
with
a
figure
-
head
of
solid
gold
,
and
a
crew
of
eighty
splendidly
armed
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
interest
to
help
the
new
King
with
his
power
,
if
the
new
King
would
help
him
against
the
popular
distrust
and
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
make
a
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
the
Confessor
get
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
get
more
power
and
more
land
,
and
his
daughter
Editha
be
make
queen
;
for
it
be
a
part
of
their
compact
that
the
King
should
take
her
for
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
although
she
be
a
gentle
lady
,
in
all
thing
worthy
to
be
beloved
---
good
,
beautiful
,
sensible
,
and
kind
---
the
king
from
the
first
neglect
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
and
her
six
proud
brother
,
resent
this
cold
treatment
,
harass
the
King
greatly
by
exert
all
their
power
to
make
him
unpopular
.
 
<EOS>
have
live
so
long
in
Normandy
,
he
prefer
the
Normans
to
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
Norman
Archbishop
,
and
Norman
Bishops
;
his
great
officer
and
favourite
be
all
Normans
;
he
introduce
the
Norman
fashion
and
the
Norman
language
;
in
imitation
of
the
state
custom
of
Normandy
,
he
attach
a
great
seal
to
his
state
document
,
instead
of
merely
mark
them
,
as
the
Saxon
Kings
have
do
,
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
---
just
as
poor
people
who
have
never
be
teach
to
write
,
now
make
the
same
mark
for
their
name
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
,
the
powerful
Earl
Godwin
and
his
six
proud
son
represent
to
the
people
as
disfavour
show
towards
the
English
;
and
thus
they
daily
increase
their
own
power
,
and
daily
diminish
the
power
of
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
greatly
help
by
an
event
that
occur
when
he
have
reign
eight
year

<EOS>
Eustace

Earl

They

enter
that
peaceful

they
take
possession

noisily
demand

lodge

<EOS>
one

the
bold

Dover

this

the

kill
nineteen

wound

He

<EOS>
what
Harold
be
do
at
sea
,
when
he
be
drive
on
the
french
coast
by
a
tempest
,
be
not
at
all
certain
;
nor
do
it
at
all
matter
.
 
<EOS>
that
his
ship
be
force
by
a
storm
on
that
shore
,
and
that
he
be
take
prisoner
,
there
be
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
barbarous
day
,
all
shipwreck
stranger
be
take
prisoner
,
and
oblige

pay
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
a
certain
Count
Guy
,
who
be
the
Lord
of
Ponthieu
where
Harold
's
disaster
happen
,
seize
him
,
instead
of
relieve
him
like
a
hospitable
and
christian
lord
as
he
ought
to
have
do
,
and
expect
to
make
a
very
good
thing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
Harold
send
off
immediately
to
Duke
William
of
Normandy
,
complaining
of
this
treatment
;
and
the
Duke
no
sooner
hear
of
it
than
he
order
Harold
to
be
escort
to
the
ancient
town
of
Rouen
,
where
he
then
be
,
and
where
he
receive
him
as
an
honoured
guest
.
<EOS>
now
,
some
writer
tell
us
that
Edward
the
Confessor
,
who
be
by
this
time
old
and
have
no
child
,
have
make
a
will
,
appoint
Duke
William
of
Normandy
his
successor
,
and
have
inform
the
Duke
of
his
have
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
be
anxious
about
his
successor
;
because
he
have
even
invite
over
,
from
abroad
,
edward
the
OUTLAW
,
a
son
of
Ironside
,
who
have
come
to
England
with
his
wife
and
three
child
,
but
whom
the
King
have
strangely
refuse
to
see
when
he
do
come
,
and
who
have
die
in
London
suddenly
(
prince
be
terribly
liable
to
sudden
death
in
those
day
)
,
and
have
be
bury
in
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
may
possibly
have
make
such
a
will
;
or
,
have
always
be
fond
of
the
Normans
,
he
may
have
encourage
Norman
William
to
aspire
to
the
english
crown
,
by
something
that
he
say
to
him
when
he
be
stay
at
the
english
court
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
certainly
William
do
now
aspire
to
it
;
and
know
that
Harold
would
be
a
powerful
rival
,
he
call
together
a
great
assembly
of
his
noble
,
offer
Harold
his
daughter
ADELE
in
marriage
,
inform
him
that
he
mean
on
King
Edward
's
death
to
claim
the
english
crown
as
his
own
inheritance
,
and
require
Harold
then
and
there
to
swear
to
aid
him
.
 
<EOS>
Harold
,
be
in
the
Duke
's
power
,
take
this
oath
upon
the
Missal
,
or
prayer
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
example
of
the
superstition
of
the
monk
,
that
this
Missal
,
instead
of
be
place
upon
a
table
,
be
place
upon
a
tub
;
which
,
when
Harold
have
swear
,
be
uncover
,
and
show
to
be
full
of
dead
man
's
bone
---
bone
,
as
the
monk
pretend
,
of
saint
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
suppose
to
make
Harold
's
oath
a
great
deal
more
impressive
and
binding
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
the
great
name
of
the
Creator
of
Heaven
and
earth
could
be
make
more
solemn
by
a
knuckle
-
bone
,
or
a
double
-
tooth
,
or
a
finger

nail
,
of
Dunstan

<EOS>
within
a
week
or
two
after
Harold
's
return
to
England
,
the
dreary
old
Confessor
be
find
to
be
die
.
 
<EOS>
after
wander
in
his
mind
like
a
very
weak
old
man
,
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
put
himself
entirely
in
the
hand
of
the
monk
when
he
be
alive
,
they
praise
him
lustily
when
he
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
go
so
far
,
already
,
as
to
persuade
him
that
he
could
work
miracle
;
and
have
bring
people
afflict
with
a
bad
disorder
of
the
skin
,
to
him
,
to
be
touch
and
cure

who
find
it
very
uncomfortable
to
have
the
country
blockade
and
their
supply
of
meat
and
drink
cut
off
,
show
the
King
a
secret
way
of
surprise
the
camp
.
 
<EOS>
so
Hereward
be
soon
defeat
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
afterwards
die
quietly
,
or
whether
he
be
kill
after
kill
sixteen
of
the
man
who
attack
him
(
as
some
old
rhyme
relate
that
he
do
)
,
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
His
defeat
put
an
end
to
the
Camp
of
Refuge
;
and
,
very
soon
afterwards
,
the
King
,
victorious
both
in
Scotland
and
in
England
,
quell
the
last
rebellious
English
noble
.
<EOS>
He
then
surround
himself
with
Norman
lord
,
enrich
by
the
property
of
english
noble
;
have
a
great
survey
make
of
all
the
land
in
England
,
which
be
enter
as
the
property
of
its
new
owner
,
on
a
roll
call
Doomsday
Book
;
oblige
the
people
to
put
out
their
fire
and
candle
at
a
certain
hour
every
night
,
on
the
ringing
of
a
bell
which
be
call
the
Curfew
;
introduce
the
Norman
dress
and
manner
;
make
the
Normans
master
everywhere
,
and
the
English
,
servant
;
turn
out
the
english
bishop
,
and
put
Normans
in
their
place
;
and
show
himself
to
be
the
Conqueror
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
even
with
his
own
Normans
,
he
have
a
restless
life
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
always
hunger
and
thirst
for
the
rich
of
the
English
;
and
the
more
he
give
,
the
more
they
want
.
 
<EOS>
His
priest
be
as
greedy
as
his
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
of
only
one
Norman
who
plainly
tell
his
master
,
the
King
,
that
he
have
come
with
him
to
England
to
do
his
duty
as
a
faithful
servant
,
and
that
property
take
by
force
from
other
man
have
no
charm
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
GUILBERT
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
not
forget
his
name
,
for
it
be
good
to
remember
and
to
honour
honest
man
.
  
<EOS>
besides
all
these
trouble
,
William
the
Conqueror
be
trouble
by
quarrel
among
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
three
living
.
 
<EOS>
ROBERT
,
call
CURTHOSE
,
because
of
his
short
leg
;
WILLIAM
,
call
RUFUS
or
the
Red
,
from
the
colour
of
his
hair
;
and
HENRY
,
fond
of
learning
,
and
call
,
in
the
Norman
language
,
BEAUCLERC
,
or
Fine
-
Scholar
.
 
<EOS>
when
Robert
grow
up
,
he
ask
of
his
father
the
government
of
Normandy
,
which
he
have
nominally
possess
,
as
a
child
,
under
his
mother
,
MATILDA
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
refuse
to
grant
it
,
Robert
become
jealous
and
discontent
;
and
happen
one
day
,
while
in
this
temper
,
to
be
ridicule
by
his
brother
,
who
throw
water
on
him
from
a
balcony
as
he
be
walk
before
the
door
,
he
draw
his
sword
,
rush
upstairs
,
and
be
only
prevent
by
the
King
himself
from
put
them
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
that
same
night
,
he
hotly
depart
with
some
follower
from
his
father
's
court
,
and
endeavour
to
take
the
Castle
of
Rouen
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
fail
in
this
,
he
shut
himself
up
in
another
Castle
in
Normandy
,
which
the
King
besiege
,
and
where
Robert
one
day
unhorsed
and
nearly
kill
him
without
know
who
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
His
submission
when
he
discover
his
father
,
and
the
intercession
of
the
queen
and
other
,
reconcile
them
;
but
not
soundly
;
for
Robert
soon
stray
abroad
,
and
go
from
court
to
court
with
his
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
gay
,
careless
,
thoughtless
fellow
,
spend
all
he
get
on
musician
and
dancer
;
but
his
mother
love
him
,
and
often
,
against
the
King
's
command
,
supply
him
with
money
through
a
messenger
name
SAMSON
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
incensed
King
swear
he
would
tear
out
Samson
's
eye
;
and
Samson
,
think
that
his
only
hope
of
safety
be
in
become
a
monk
,
become
one
,
go
on
such
errand
no
more
,
and
keep
his
eye
in
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time

from
the
turbulent
day
of
his
strange
coronation
,
the
Conqueror
have
be
struggle

object
ever
before

He

bold
man

and
he
succeed
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
love
money
,
and
be
particular
in
his
eating
,
but
he
have
only
leisure
to
indulge
one
other
passion
,
and
that
be
his
love
of
hunting

<EOS>
He

it
to
such
a
height
that
he
order
whole

detest
him
for
his
merciless

to
their
many

He

It

England

have
sometimes
make
expensive
tomb

dead

<EOS>
the
King

Robert

seem
quite
content
to
be
only
Duke

the
King

other

Fine

be
quiet
enough
with
his

in

the

flatter
himself

we
may
suppose

with
the
hope

an
easy
reign

<EOS>
but
easy
reign
be
difficult
to
have
in
those
day

<EOS>
the
turbulent
Bishop
ODO
(
who
have
bless
the
Norman
army
at
the
Battle
of
Hastings

and
who
,
I
dare
say
,
take
all
the
credit
of
the
victory
to
himself
)
soon
begin
,
in
concert
with
some
powerful
Norman
noble
,
to
trouble
the
Red
King
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
seem
to
be
that
this
bishop
and
his
friend
,
who
have
land
in
England
and
land
in
Normandy
,
wish
to
hold
both
under
one
sovereign
;
and
greatly
prefer
a
thoughtless
good
-
natured
person
,
such
as
Robert
be
,
to
Rufus
;
who
,
though
far
from
be
an
amiable
man
in
any
respect
,
be
keen
,
and
not
to
be
impose
upon
.
<EOS>
They
declare
in
Robert
's
favour
,
and
retire
to
their
castle
(
those
castle
be
very
troublesome
to
king
)
in
a
sullen
humour
.
<EOS>
the
Red
King
,
see
the
Normans
thus
fall
from
him
,
revenge
himself
upon
them
by
appeal
to
the
English
;
to
whom
he
make
a
variety
of
promise
,
which
he
never
mean
to
perform
---
in
particular
,
promise
to
soften
the
cruelty
of
the
Forest
Laws
;
and
who
,
in
return
,
so
aid
him
with
their
valour
,
that
ODO
be
besiege
in
the
Castle
of
Rochester
,
and
force
to
abandon
it
,
and
to
depart
from
England
for
ever
:
 
whereupon
the
other
rebellious
Norman
noble
be
soon
reduce
and
scatter
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
the
Red
King
go
over
to
Normandy
,
where
the
people
suffer
greatly
under
the
loose
rule
of
Duke
Robert
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
object
be
to
seize
upon
the
Duke
's
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
the
Duke
,
of
course
,
prepare
to
resist
;
and
miserable
war
between
the
two
brother
seem
inevitable
,
when
the
powerful
noble
on
both
side
,
who
have
see
so
much
of
war
,
interfere
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
treaty
be
make
.
<EOS>
each
of
the
two
brother
agree
to
give
up
something
of
his
claim
,
and
that
the
longer

of
the

should
inherit
all
the
dominion
of
the
other

<EOS>
when
they
have
come
to
this
love
understanding
,
they
embrace

their

Archbishop

he
no

persist

some
of

this
lead

violent

ask
leave

<EOS>
the
Red

gladly
give
it

but
the
english
sailor
desert
the

and
take

;
so

in

that
the

<EOS>
Poor
Robert

readily
trust
his

the

and
agree
to
go
home

receive
a
pension
from
England

on
condition
that
all
his
follower
be
fully
pardon

<EOS>
this
<EOS>
the
King
very
faithfully
promise

but
Robert
be
no
sooner
go
than
he
begin
to
punish
them
.
  
<EOS>
among
them
be
the
Earl

summon
by

to
answer
to
five

forty
accusation

ride
away
to
one

his
strong
castle

shut
himself
up
therein
,
call
around
him
his
tenant
and
vassal
,
and
fight
for
his
liberty
,
but
be
defeat
and
banish
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
,
with
all
his
fault
,
be
so
true
to
his
word
,
that
when
he
first
hear
of
this
nobleman
have
rise
against
his
brother
,
he
lay
waste
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
's
estate
in
Normandy
,
to
show
the
king
that
he
would
favour
no
breach
of
their
treaty
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
on
well
information
,
afterwards
,
that
the
Earl
's
only
crime
be
have
be
his
friend
,
he
come
over
to
England
,
in
his
old
thoughtless
,
warm
-
hearted
way
,
to
intercede
with
the
King
,
and
remind
him
of
the
solemn
promise
to
pardon
all
his
follower
.
  
<EOS>
this
confidence
may
have
put
the
false
king
to
the
blush

but
it
do
not

<EOS>
pretend
to
be
very
friendly
,
he
so
surround
his

with
spy
and
trap
,
that
Robert
,
who
be
quite
in
his
power

have
nothing
for
it
but
to
renounce
his
pension
and
escape
while
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
get
home
to
Normandy
,
and
understand
the
King
better
now
,
he
naturally
ally
himself
with
his
old
friend
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
,
who
have
still
thirty
castle
in
that
country

<EOS>
this

exactly
what
Henry

<EOS>
He
immediately
declare
that
Robert
have
break
the
treaty
,
and
next
year
invade
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
He
pretend
that
he
come
to
deliver
the
Normans
,
at
their
own
request
,
from
his
brother
's
misrule
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
reason
to
fear
that
his
misrule
be
bad
enough
;
for
his
beautiful
wife
have
die
,
leave
him
with
an
infant
son
,
and
his
court
be
again
so
careless
,
dissipate
,
and
ill
-
regulate
,
that
it
be
say
he
sometimes
lie
in
bed
of
a
day
for
want
of
clothe
to
put
on
---
his
attendant
have
steal
all
his
dress
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
head
his
army
like
a
brave
prince
and
a
gallant
soldier
,
though
he
have
the
misfortune
to
be
take
prisoner
by
King
Henry
,
with
four
hundred
of
his
Knights
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
be
poor
harmless
Edgar
Atheling
,
who
love
Robert
well
.
 
<EOS>
Edgar
be
not
important
enough
to
be
severe
with
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
afterwards
give
him
a
small
pension
,
which
he
live
upon
and
die
upon
,
in
peace
,
among
the
quiet
wood
and
field
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
and
Robert
---
poor
,
kind
,
generous
,
wasteful
,
heedless
Robert
,
with
so
many
fault
,
and
yet
with
virtue
that
may
have
make
a
well
and
a
happy
man
---
what
be
the
end
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
if
the
King
have
have
the
magnanimity
to
say
with
a
kind
air
,
"
brother

tell
me
,
before
these
nobleman

that
from
this
time
you
will
be
my
faithful
follower

and
never
raise
your
hand
against
me
or
my
force
more
!
"
<EOS>
he
may
have
trust
Robert
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
king
be
not
a
magnanimous
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
sentence
his
brother
to
be
confine
for
life
in
one
of
the
Royal
Castles
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
his
imprisonment
,
he
be
allow

ride
out

but
he
one
day
break
away
from
his
guard
and
gallop
of
.

He

the
evil

to
ride
into
a
swamp

when

which

by
put
a
red

hot
metal
basin
on
his

<EOS>
and
so
,
in
darkness
and
in
prison

all
his
past
life

of
the
time
he
have
waste

the
treasure
he

of
the
opportunity
he
have
lose
,
of
the
youth
he
have
throw
away
,
of
the
talent
he
have
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
on
fine
autumn
morning
,
he
would
sit
and
think
of
the
old
hunting
party
in
the
free
Forest
,
where
he
have
be
the
foremost
and
the
gay
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
in

still
night
,
he
would
wake
,
and
mourn
for
the
many
night
that
have
steal
past
him
at
the
gaming

table
;
sometimes
,
would
seem
to
hear
,
upon
the
melancholy
wind
,
the
old
song
of
the
minstrel
;
sometimes
,
would
dream
,
in
his
blindness
,
of
the
light
and
glitter
of
the
Norman
Court

<EOS>
many
and
many
a
time
,
he
grope
back
,
in
his
fancy
,
to
Jerusalem

where
he
have
fight
so
well
;
or
,
at
the
head
of
his
brave
companion
,
bow
his
feather
helmet
to
the
shout
of
welcome
greet
him
in
Italy
,
and
seem
again
to
walk
among
the
sunny
vineyard
,
or
on
the
shore
of
the
blue
sea
,
with
his
lovely
wife
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
think
of
her
grave
,
and
of
his
fatherless
boy
,
he
would
stretch
out
his
solitary
arm
and
weep
.
  
<EOS>
at

one

the

trust
of
this
King
's
life
be
in
such
bargain
,
and
he
believe
(
as
many
another
King
have
do
since
,
and
as
one
King
do
in
France
a
very
little
time
ago
)
that
every
man
's
truth
and
honour
can
be
buy
at
some
price
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
this
,
he
be
so
afraid
of
William
Fitz
-
Robert
and
his
friend
,
that
,
for
a
long
time
,
he
believe
his
life
to
be
in
danger
;
and
never
lay
down
to
sleep
,
even
in
his
palace
surround
by
his
guard
,
without
have
a
sword
and
buckler
at
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
to
strengthen
his
power
,
the
King
with
great
ceremony
betroth
his
eld
daughter
MATILDA
,
then
a
child
only
eight
year
old
,
to
be
the
wife
of
Henry
the
Fifth
,
the
Emperor
of
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
to
raise
her
marriage
-
portion
,
he
tax
the
english
people
in
a
most
oppressive
manner
;
then
treat
them
to
a
great
procession
,
to
restore
their
good
humour
;
and
send
Matilda
away
,
in
fine
state
,
with
the
german
ambassador
,
to
be
educate
in
the
country
of
her
future
husband
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
his
queen
,
Maud
the
Good
,
unhappily
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
thought
for
that
gentle
lady
,
that
the
only
hope
with
which
she
have
marry
a
man
whom
she
have
never
love
---
the
hope
of
reconcile
the
Norman
and
English
race
---
have
fail
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
very
time
of
her
death
,
Normandy
and
all
France
be
in
arm
against
England
;
for
,
so
soon
as
his
last
danger
be
over
,
King
Henry
have
be
false
to
all
the
french
power
he
have
promise
,
bribe
,
and
buy
,
and
they
have
naturally
unite
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
fighting
,
however
,
in
which
few
suffer
but
the
unhappy
common
people
(
who
always
suffer
,
whatsoever
be
the
matter
)
,
he
begin
to
promise
,
bribe
,
and
buy
again
;
and
by
those
mean
,
and
by
the
help
of
the
Pope
,
who
exert
himself
to
save
more
bloodshed
,
and
by
solemnly
declare
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
he
really
be
in
earnest
this
time
,
and
would
keep
his
word
,
the
King
make
peace
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
first
consequence
of
this
peace
be
,
that
the
King
go
over
to
Normandy
with
his
son
Prince
William
and
a
great
retinue
,
to
have
the
Prince
acknowledge
as
his
successor

the
Norman
Nobles
,

to
contract
the
promise
marriage

(
this
be
one
of
the
many
promise

They

They

by

Woe

sink

the
bottom

<EOS>
the
other
two
clung

yard
for
some
hour

<EOS>
at

young
noble

Farewell

he
drop

and
of
all
the
brilliant
crowd

the
poor
Butcher

<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
some
fisherman
see
him
float
in
his
sheep
-
skin
coat
,
and
get
him
into
their
boat
---
the
sole
relater
of
the
dismal
tale
.
  
<EOS>
for
three
day
,
no
one
dare
to
carry
the
intelligence
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
they
send
into
his
presence
a
little
boy
,
who
,
weep
bitterly
,
and
kneel
at
his
foot
,
tell
him
that
the
White
Ship
be
lose
with
all
on

<EOS>
the
King
fall
to
the
ground
like
a
dead
man
,
and
never
,
never
afterwards
,
be
see
to
smile
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
plot
again
,
and
promise
again
,
and
bribe
and
buy
again
,
in
his
old
deceitful
way
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
son
to
succeed
him
,
after
all
his
pain
(
"
the
Prince
will
never
yoke
us
to
the
plough
,
now
!
"
say
the
english
people
)
,
he
take
a
second
wife
---
ADELAIS
or
ALICE

a
duke
's
daughter
,
and
the
Pope
's
niece
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
more
child

however

he
propose
to
the
Barons
to
swear
that
they
would
recognise
as
his
successor
,
his
daughter
Matilda
,
whom
,
as
she
be
now
a
widow
,
he
marry
to
the
eld
son
of
the
Count
of
Anjou
,
GEOFFREY
,
surname
PLANTAGENET
,
from
a
custom
he
have
of
wear
a
sprig
of
flower
broom
(
call
Genàt
in
French
)
in
his
cap
for
a
feather
.
 
<EOS>
as
one
false
man
usually
make
many
,
and
as
a
false
king
,
in
particular
,
be
pretty
certain
to
make
a
false
court
,
the
Barons
take
the
oath
about
the
succession
of
Matilda
(
and
her
child
after
her
)
,
twice
over
,
without
in
the
least
intending
to
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
now
relieve
from
any
remain
fear
of
William
Fitz
-
Robert
,
by
his
death
in
the
Monastery
of
St
Omer
,
in
France
,
at
twenty
-
six
year
old
,
of
a
pike
-
wound
in
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Matilda
give
birth
to
three
son
,
he
think
the
succession
to
the
throne
secure
.
  
<EOS>
He
spend
most
of
the
latter
part
of
his
life
,
which
be
trouble
by
family
quarrel
,
in
Normandy
,
to
be
near
Matilda
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
reign
upward
of
thirty
-
five
year
,
and
be
sixty
-
seven
year
old
,
he
die
of
an
indigestion
and
fever
,
bring
on
by
eat
,
when
he
be
far
from
well
,
of
a
fish
call
Lamprey
,
against
which
he
have
often
be
caution
by
his
physician
.
 
<EOS>
His
remain
be
bring
over
to
Reading
Abbey
to
be
bury

<EOS>
You
may
perhaps
hear
the
cunning
and
promise
-
breaking
of
King
Henry
the
first
,
call
"
policy
"
by
some
people
,
and
"
diplomacy
"
by
other
.
 
<EOS>
neither
of
these
fine
word
will
in
the
least
mean
that
it
be
true
;
and
nothing
that
be
not
true
can
possibly
be
good
.
  
<EOS>
His
great
merit
,
that
I
know
of
,
be
his
love
of
learning
---
I
should
have
give
him
great
credit
even
for
that
,
if
it
have
be
strong
enough
to
induce
him
to
spare
the
eye
of
a
certain
poet
he
once
take
prisoner
,
who
be
a
knight
besides
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
order
the
poet
's
eye
to
be
tear
from
his
head
,
because
he
have
laugh
at
him
in
his
verse
;
and
the
poet
,
in
the
pain
of
that
torture
,
dash
out
his
own
brain
against
his
prison
wall
.
 
<EOS>
King
Henry
the
First
be
avaricious
,
revengeful
,
and
so
false
,
that
I
suppose
a
man
never
live
whose
word
be
less
to
be
rely
upon
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Matilda
and
Stephen
    
<EOS>
the
King
be
no
sooner
dead
than
all
the
plan
and
scheme
he
have
labour
at
so
long
,
and
lie
so
much
for
,
crumble
away
like
a
hollow
heap
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
STEPHEN
,
whom
he
have
never
mistrust
or
suspect
,
start
up
to
claim
the
throne
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
be
the
son
of
ADELA

the
Conqueror

daughter

marry
to
the
Count
of
Blois

<EOS>
to
Stephen

and
to
his
brother
HENRY

the
late
King
have
be
liberal
;
make
Henry
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
and
find
a
good
marriage
for
Stephen
,
and
much
enrich
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
prevent
Stephen
from
hastily
produce
a
false
witness
,
a
servant
of
the
late
King
,
to
swear
that
the
King
have
name
him
for
his
heir
upon
his
death

bed

<EOS>
on
this
evidence
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
crown
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
new
King

so
suddenly
make
,
lose
not
a
moment
in
seize
the
royal
treasure

hire
foreign
soldier
with
some
of
it

if
the

have
even
do

the
false

he

have
have
small
right

away
the

the

all
this

the
unspeakable
misery

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
many
other
nobleman
repeat
and
support
this
when
it
be
once
utter
,
Stephen
and
young
Plantagenet
go
down
,
each
to
his
own
bank
of
the
river
,
and
hold
a
conversation
across
it
,
in
which
they
arrange
a
truce
;
very
much
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
Eustace
,
who
swagger
away
with
some
follower
,
and
lay
violent
hand
on
the
Abbey
of
St
Edmund's
-
Bury
,
where
he
presently
die
mad

<EOS>
the
truce
lead
to
a
solemn
council
at
Winchester
,
in
which
it
be
agree
that
Stephen
should
retain
the
crown
,
on
condition
of
his
declare
Henry
his
successor
;
that
WILLIAM

another
son

inherit
his

rightful
possession

and
that
all
the

land
which
Stephen
have
give
away
should
be
recall

and
all
the
Castles
he
have
permit

demolish

<EOS>
thus
terminate
the
bitter
war
,
which
have
now
last
fifteen
year

and
have
again
lay
England
waste

<EOS>
in
the

STEPHEN

after
a
troubled

nineteen

although

Stephen
be

although
nothing
bad
be

his
usurpation
of

which
he
probably
excuse
to
himself
by
the
consideration
that
King
Henry
the
First
be
a
usurper
too
---
which
be
no
excuse
at
all
;
the
people
of
England
suffer
more
in
these
dread
nineteen
year
,
than
at
any
former
period
even
of
their
suffering
history
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
division
of
the
nobility
between
the
two
rival
claimant
of
the
Crown

in
the
growth
of
what

They

the

the

and
what
with
those
of

)
be
lord
of

third
part

<EOS>
He
be
a

of
vigour

ability

and
resolution
,
and
immediately
apply
himself
to
remove
some
of
the
evil
which
have
arise
in
the
last
unhappy
reign
.
 
<EOS>
He
revoke
all
the
grant
of
land
that
have
be
hastily
make
,
on
either
side
,
during
the
late
struggle
;
he
oblige
number
of
disorderly
soldier
to
depart
from
England
;
he
reclaim
all
the
castle
belong
to
the
Crown
;
and
he
force
the
wicked
noble
to
pull
down
their
own
castle
,
to
the
number
of
eleven
hundred
,
in
which
such
dismal
cruelty
have
be
inflict
on
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
brother
,
GEOFFREY
,
rise
against
him
in
France
,
while
he
be
so
well
employ
,
and
render
it
necessary
for
him
to
repair
to
that
country
;
where
,
after
he
have
subdue
and
make
a
friendly
arrangement
with
his
brother
(
who
do
not
live
long
)
,
his
ambition
to
increase
his

involve
him
in
a

with
the

Louis

with

he
have

term
just

<EOS>
however
,
the
war
come
to
nothing
at
last
,
and
the
Pope
make
the
two
king
friend
again
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
clergy
,
in
the
trouble
of
the
last
reign
,
have
go
on
very
ill
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
all
kind
of
criminal
among
them
---
murderer
,
thief
,
and
vagabond
;
and
the
bad
of
the
matter
be
,
that
the
good
priest
would
not
give
up
the
bad
priest
to
justice
,
when
they
commit
crime
,
but
persist
in
shelter

defend
them

<EOS>
the
King
,
well
know

there
could
be
no
peace

rest
in
England
while
such
thing
last

resolve
to
reduce
the
power
of
the
clergy
;
and
,
when
he
have
reign
seven
year
,
find
(
as
he
consider
)
a
good
opportunity
for
do
so
,
in
the
death
of
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
for
the

,
"
think
the

"
a
friend
in

I
can
trust

help
me
to
humble
these
rebellious
priest

so

he
resolve

make
his
favourite

the
new
Archbishop

this
favourite
be
so
extraordinary
a
man

and
his

curious

all

this

escape
with
his

who
have
be

the

<EOS>
the

have
teach

until
the

understand
that
she
want
to
find
an

that
would
carry
her
there
;
so
they
show
her

the

one

the

<EOS>
then
,
he
take
the
merchant
by

and
point
out

window

and
there
they
see

dirty

He

the
Favourite
of
King
Henry
the
Second

<EOS>
He
have
become
Chancellor
,
when
the
King
think
of
make

He

,
"
how
splendid
must

King
of
England
be
,
when
this
be
only
the
Chancellor

"
 
<EOS>
They
have
good
reason
to
wonder
at
the
magnificence
of
Thomas
a
Becket
,
for
,
when
he
enter
a
french
town
,
his
procession
be
head
by
two
hundred
and
fifty
singe
boy
;
then
,
come
his
hound
in
couple
;
then
,
eight
waggon
,
each
draw
by
five
horse
drive
by
five
driver
:
two
of
the
waggon
fill
with
strong
ale
to
be
give
away
to
the
people
;
four
,
with
his
gold
and
silver
plate
and
stately
clothe
;
two
,
with
the
dress
of
his
numerous
servant
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
come
twelve
horse
,
each
with
a
monkey
on
his
back
;
then
,
a
train
of
people
bear
shield
and
lead
fine
war
-
horse
splendidly
equip
;
then
,
falconer
with
hawk
upon
their
wrist
;
then
,
a
host
of
knight
,
and
gentleman
and
priest
;
then
,
the
Chancellor
with
his
brilliant
garment
flash
in
the
sun
,
and
all
the
people
caper
and
shout
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
be
well
pleased
with
all
this
,
think
that
it
only
make
himself
the
more
magnificent
to
have
so
magnificent
a
favourite
;
but
he
sometimes
jest
with
the
Chancellor
upon
his
splendour
too
.
<EOS>
once
,
when
they
be
ride
together
through
the
street
of
London
in
hard
winter
weather
,
they
see
a
shivering
old
man
in
rag
.
<EOS>
"
look
at
the
poor
object
!
"
say
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
not
be
a
charitable
act
to
give
that
aged
man
a
comfortable
warm
cloak
?
"
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
it
would
,
"
say
Thomas
a
Becket
,
"
and
<EOS>
you
do
well
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
to
think
of
such
christian
duty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
!
"
cry
the
king
,
"
then
give
him
your
cloak
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
make
of
rich
crimson
trim
with
ermine
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
try
to
pull
it
off
,
the
Chancellor
try
to
keep
it
on
,
both
be
near
roll
from
their
saddle
in
the
mud
,
when
the
Chancellor
submit
,
and
the
King
give
the
cloak
to
the
old
beggar
:
 
much
to
the
beggar
's
astonishment
,
and
much
to
the
merriment
of
all
the
courtier
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
courtier
be
not
only
eager
to
laugh
when
the
King
laugh
,
but
they
really
do
enjoy
a
laugh
against
a
Favourite
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
,
"
think
King
Henry
the
second
,
"
this
Chancellor
of
mine
,
Thomas
a
Becket
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
then
be
the
head
of
the
Church
,
and
,
be
devoted
to
me
,
will
help
me
to
correct
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
uphold
my
power
against
the
power
of
the
clergy
,
and
once
publicly
tell
some
bishop
(
I
remember
)
,
that
man
of
the
Church
be
equally
bind
to
me
,
with
man
of
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
<EOS>
a
Becket
be
the
man
,
of
all
other
man
in
England
,
to
help
me
in
my
great
design
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
the
King
,
regardless
of
all
objection
,
either
that
he
be
a
fighting
man
,
or
a
lavish
man
,
or
a
courtly
man
,
or
a
man
of
pleasure
,
or
anything
but
a
likely
man
for
the
office
,
make
him
Archbishop
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Thomas
a
Becket
be
proud
and
love
to
be
famous
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
already
famous
for
the
pomp
of
his
life
,
for
his
rich
,
his
gold
and
silver
plate
,
his
waggon
,
horse
,
and
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
do
no
more
in
that
way
than
he
have
do
;
and
be
tired
of
that
kind
of
fame
(
which
be
a
very
poor
one
)
<EOS>
,
he
long
to
have
his
name
celebrate
for
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
he
know
,
would
render
him
so
famous
in
the
world
,
as
the
setting
of
his
utmost
power
and
ability
against
the
utmost
power
and
ability
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolve
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
mind
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
may
have
have
some
secret
grudge
against
the
King
besides
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
may
have
offend
his
proud
humour
at
some
time
or
other
,
for
anything
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
likely
,
because
it
be
a
common
thing
for
king
,
Princes
,
and
other
great
people
,
to
try
the
temper
of
their
favourite
rather
severely
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
little
affair
of
the
crimson
cloak
must
have
be
anything
but
a
pleasant
one
to
a
haughty
man
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
know
better
than
any
one
in
England
what
the
King
expect
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
his
sumptuous
life
,
he
have
never
yet
be
in
a
position
to
disappoint
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
take
up
that
proud
stand
now
,
as
head
of
the
Church
;
and
he
determine
that
it
should
be
write
in
history
,
either
that
he
subdue
the
King
,
or
that
the
King
subdue
him
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
of
a
sudden
,
he
completely
alter
the
whole
manner
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
off
all
his
brilliant
follower
,
eat
coarse
food
,
drink
bitter
water
,
wear
next
his
skin
sackcloth
cover
with
dirt
and
vermin
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
then
think
very
religious
to
be
very
dirty
)
,
flog
his
back
to
punish
himself
,
live
chiefly
in
a
little
cell
,
wash
the
foot
of
thirteen
poor
people
every
day
,
and
look
as
miserable
as
he
possibly
could
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
put
twelve
hundred
monkey
on
horseback
instead
of
twelve
,
and
have
go
in
procession
with
eight
thousand
waggon
instead
of
eight
,
he
could
not
have
half
astonish
the
people
so
much
as
by
this
great
change
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
cause
him
to
be
more
talk
about
as
an
Archbishop
than
he
have
be
as
a
Chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
be
very
angry
;
and
be
make
still
more
so
,
when
the
new
Archbishop
,
claim
various
estate
from
the
noble
as
be
rightfully
Church
property
,
require
the
King
himself
,
for
the
same
reason
,
to
give
up
Rochester
Castle
,
and
Rochester
City
too
.
 
<EOS>
not
satisfied
with
this
,
he
declare
that
no
power
but
himself
should
appoint
a
priest
to
any
Church
in
the
part
of
England
over
which
he
be
Archbishop
;
and
when
a
certain
gentleman
of
Kent
make
such
an
appointment
,
as
he
claim
to
have
the
right
to
do
,
Thomas
a
Becket
excommunicate
him
.
  
<EOS>
excommunication
be
,
next
to
the
Interdict
I
tell
you
of
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
,
the
great
weapon
of
the
clergy
.
 
<EOS>
It
consist
in
declare
the
person
who
be
excommunicate
,
an
outcast
from
the
Church
and
from
all
religious
office
;
and
in
curse
him
all
over
,
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
whether
he
be
stand
up
,
lie
down
,
sit
,
kneel
,
walking
,
run
,
hop
,
jump
,
gaping
,
coughing
,
sneeze
,
or
whatever
else
he
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
this
unchristian
nonsense
would
of
course
have
make
no
sort
of
difference
to
the
person
curse
---
who
could
say
his
prayer
at
home
if
he
be
shut
out
of
church
,
and
whom
none
but
GOD
could
judge
---
but
for
the
fear
and
superstition
of
the
people
,
who
avoid
excommunicate
person
,
and
make
their
life
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
King
say
to
the
New
Archbishop
,
"
take
off
this
excommunication
from
this
gentleman
of
Kent
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
the
Archbishop
reply
,
"
I
shall
do
no
such
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
quarrel
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
a
priest
in
Worcestershire
commit
a
most
dreadful
murder
,
that
arouse
the
horror
of
the
whole
nation
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
demand
to
have
this
wretch
deliver
up
,
to
be
try
in
the
same
court
and
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
refuse
,
and
keep
him
in
the
Bishop
's
prison
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
hold
a
solemn
assembly
in
Westminster
Hall
,
demand
that
in
future
all
priest
find
guilty
before
their
Bishops
of
crime
against
the
law
of
the
land
should
be
consider
priest
no
longer
,
and
should
be
deliver
over
to
the
law
of
the
land
for
punishment
.
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
again
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
require
to
know
whether
the
clergy
would
obey
the
ancient
custom
of
the
country
?
 
<EOS>
every
priest
there
,
but
one
,
say
,
after
Thomas
a
Becket
,
"
save
my
order
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
really
mean
that
they
would
only
obey
those
custom
when
they
do
not
interfere
with
their
own
claim
;
and
the
King
go
out
of
the
Hall
in
great
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
clergy
begin
to
be
afraid
,
now
,
that
they
be
go
too
far
.
 
<EOS>
though
Thomas
a
Becket
be
otherwise
as
unmoved
as
Westminster
Hall
,
they
prevail
upon
him
,
for
the
sake
of
their
fear
,
to
go
to
the
King
at
Woodstock
,
and
promise
to
observe
the
ancient
custom
of
the
country
,
without
say
anything
about
his
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
receive
this
submission
favourably
,
and
summon
a
great
council
of
the
clergy
to
meet
at
the
Castle
of
Clarendon
,
by
Salisbury
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
council
meet
,
the
Archbishop
again
insist
on
the
word
"
say
my
order
;
"
and
he
still
insist
,
though
lord
entreat
him
,
and
priest
weep
before
him
and
knelt
to
him
,
and
an
adjoining
room
be
throw
open
,
fill
with
armed
soldier
of
the
King
,
to
threaten
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
give
way
,
for
that
time
,
and
the
ancient
custom
(
which
include
what
the
King
have
demand
in
vain
)
be
state
in
writing
,
and
be
sign
and
seal
by
the
chief
of
the
clergy
,
and
be
call
the
Constitutions
of
Clarendon
.
  
<EOS>
the
quarrel
go
on
,
for
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
try
to
see
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
would
not
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
try
to
escape
from
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
sailor
on
the
coast
would
launch
no
boat
to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
again
resolve
to
do
his
bad
in
opposition
to
the
King
,
and
begin
openly
to
set
the
ancient
custom
at
defiance
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
summon
him
before
a
great
council
at
Northampton
,
where
he
accuse
him
of
high
treason
,
and
make
a
claim
against
him
,
which
be
not
a
just
one
,
for
an
enormous
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
be
alone
against
the
whole
assembly
,
and
the
very
Bishops
advise
him
to
resign
his
office
and
abandon
his
contest
with
the
King
.
<EOS>
His
great
anxiety
and
agitation
stretch
him
on
a
sick
-
bed
for
two
day
,
but
he
be
still
undaunted
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
adjourn
council
,
carry
a
great
cross
in
his
right
hand
,
and
sit
down
hold
it
erect
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
angrily
retire
into
an
inner
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
assembly
angrily
retire
and
leave
him
there
.
<EOS>
but
there
he
sit
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishops
come
out
again
in
a
body
,
and
renounce
him
as
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
say
,
"
I
hear
!
"
and
sit
there
still
.
 
<EOS>
They
retire
again
into
the
inner
room
,
and
his
trial
proceed
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by

the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
head

out
to
read
his
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
He
refuse
to
hear
it
,
deny
the
power
of
the
court
,
and
say
he
would
refer
his
cause
to
the
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
walk
out
of
the
hall
,
with
the
cross
in
his
hand
,
some
of
those
present
pick
up
rush
---
rush
be
strew
upon
the
floor
in
those
day
by
way
of
carpet
---
and
throw
them
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
proudly
turn
his
head
,
and
say
that
be
he
not
Archbishop
,
he
would
chastise
those
coward
with
the
sword
he
have
know
how
to
use
in
bygone
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
mount
his
horse
,
and
ride
away
,
cheer
and
surround
by
the
common
people
,
to
whom
he
throw
open
his
house
that
night
and
give
a
supper
,
sup
with
them
himself
.
 
<EOS>
that
same
night
he
secretly
depart
from
the
town

and
<EOS>
so

and

<EOS>
the
struggle

<EOS>
the
angry

possession
of

of
the
archbishopric
,
and
banish
all
the
relation
and
servant
of
Thomas
a
Becket
,
to
the
number
of
four

<EOS>
the
Pope
and
the
french
King

him
,
and

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Thomas
a
Becket
,
for
his
part

be
not
idle
at
Rome
,
but
constantly
employ
his
utmost
art
in
his

<EOS>
thus
the
contest
stand
,
until
there
be
peace
between

then

Thomas

he
be
obstinate
and
immovable
as

<EOS>
King
Louis
of
France
be
weak
enough
in
his
veneration
for
Thomas
a
Becket
and
such
man
,
but
this
be
a
little
too
much
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
a
Becket
"
want
to
be
great
than
the
saint
and
well
than
St
Peter
,
"
and
ride
away
from

<EOS>
His
poor
French
Majesty
ask
a
Becket
's
pardon
for
so
do
,
however
,
soon
afterwards

and
cut
a
very
pitiful

<EOS>
at
last

and
after
a
world
of
trouble

it
come
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
meeting
on
french
ground
between
King
Henry

Thomas

and
it
be
agree
that
Thomas

should
be
Archbishop

accord
to
the
custom
of

Archbishops

and
that
the
King
should
put
him
in
possession
of
the
revenue
of
that
post
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
indeed

you
may
suppose
the
struggle
at
an
end
,
and
Thomas

at
rest

<EOS>
Thomas

after
an
absence

<EOS>
He

and
march
about

in
a
soldierly
way

with
such
rustic
weapon
as
they
could
get
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
see
the
young
prince
who
have
once
be
his
pupil

but
be
prevent

<EOS>
He
hope
for
some
little
support
among
the
noble

but
find
none

<EOS>
He
make
the
most
of

and
go
from
Canterbury

tell

very
natural
in
the
person
so
freely
excommunicate

complain
to
the
King

<EOS>
It
be
equally
natural
in
the
King

who
have
hope
that
this
troublesome
opponent
be
at
last
quieted
,
to
fall
into
a
mighty
rage

on
the
Archbishop

tell
him
that
he
never

Thomas

out
hastily
before

<EOS>
three
of
whom
have
be
in
the
train
of
Thomas

Becket
in
the
old
day
of
his
splendour
.
 
<EOS>
They
ride
away
on
horseback
,
in
a
very
secret
manner
,
and
on
the
third
day
after
Christmas
Day
arrive
at
Saltwood
House
,
not
far
from
Canterbury
,
which
belong
to
the
family
of
Ranulf
de
Broc
.
 
<EOS>
They
quietly
collect
some
follower
here
,
in
case
they
should
need
any
;
and
proceed
to
Canterbury
,
suddenly
appear
(
the
four
knight
and
twelve
man
)
before
the
Archbishop
,
in
his
own
house
,
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
They
neither
bow
nor
speak
,
but
sit
down
on
the
floor
in
silence
,
stare
at
the
Archbishop
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
say
,
at
length
,
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
want
,
"
say
Reginald
Fitzurse
,
"
the
excommunication
take
from
the
Bishops
,
and
you
to
answer
for
your
offence
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
defiantly
reply
,
that
the
power
of
the
clergy
be
above
the
power
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
not
for
such
man
as
they
be
,
to
threaten
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
if
he
be
threaten
by
all
the
sword
in
England
,
he
would
never
yield
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
do
more
than
threaten
!
"
say
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
go
out
with
the
twelve
man
,
and
put
on
their
armour
,
and
draw
their
shine
sword
,
and
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
His
servant
,
in
the
meantime
,
have
shut
up
and
bar
the
great
gate
of
the
palace
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
the
knight
try
to
shatter
it
with
their
battle
-
axis
;
but
,
be
show
a
window
by
which
they
could
enter
,
they
let
the
gate
alone
,
and
climb
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
while
they
be
batter
at
the
door
,
the
attendant
of
Thomas
a
Becket
have
implore
him
to
take
refuge
in
the
Cathedral
;
in
which
,
as
a
sanctuary
or
sacred
place
,
they
think
the
knight
would
dare
to
do
no
violent
deed
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
them
,
again
and
again
,
that
he
would
not
stir
.
 
<EOS>
hear
the
distant
voice
of
the
monk
singe
the
evening
service
,
however
,
he
say
it
be
now
his
duty
to
attend
,
and
therefore
,
and
for
no
other
reason
,
he
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
near
way
between
his
Palace
and
the
Cathedral
,
by
some
beautiful
old
cloister
which
you
may
yet
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
Cathedral
,
without
any
hurry
,
and
have
the
Cross
carry
before
him
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
safely
there
,
his
servant
would
have
fasten
the
door
,
but
he
say
no
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
house
of
God
and
not
a
fortress
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
the
shadow
of
Reginald
Fitzurse
appear
in
the
cathedral
doorway
,
darken
the
little
light
there
be
outside
,
on
the
dark
winter
evening
.
 
<EOS>
this
knight
say
,
in
a
strong
voice
,
"
follow
me
,
loyal
servant
of
the
King
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
rattle
of
the
armour
of
the
other
knight
echo
through
the
Cathedral
,
as
they
come
clash
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
dark
,
in
the
lofty
aisle
and
among
the
stately
pillar
of
the
church
,
and
there
be
so
many
hiding
-
place
in
the
crypt
below
and
in
the
narrow
passage
above
,
that
Thomas
a
Becket
may
even
at
that
pass
have
save
himself
if
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
the
monk
resolutely
that
he
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
they
all
disperse
and
leave
him
there
with
no
other
follower
than
EDWARD
GRYME
,
his
faithful
cross
-
bearer
,
he
be
as
firm
then
,
as
ever
he
have
be
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
knight
come
on
,
through
the
darkness
,
make
a
terrible
noise
with
their
armed
tread
upon
the
stone
pavement
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
traitor
?
"
they
cry
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
cry
,
"
where
be
the
Archbishop
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
proudly
,
"
I
be
here
!
"
and
come
out
of
the
shade
and
stand
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
knight
have
no
desire
to
kill
him
,
if
they
could
rid
the
King
and
themselves
of
him
by
any
other
mean
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
him
he
must
either
fly
or
go
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
do
neither
;
and
he
throw
William
Tracy
off
with
such
force
when
he
take
hold
of
his
sleeve
,
that
Tracy
reel
again
.
 
<EOS>
by
his
reproach
and
his
steadiness
,
he
so
incense
them
,
and
exasperate
their
fierce
humour
,
that
Reginald
Fitzurse
,
whom
he
call
by
an
ill
name
,
say
,
"
then
die
!
"
and
strike
at
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
faithful
Edward
Gryme
put
out
his
arm
,
and
there
receive
the
main
force
of
the
blow
,
so
that
it
only
make
his
master
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
another
voice
from
among
the
knight
again
call
to
Thomas
a
Becket
to
fly
;
but
,
with
his
blood
run
down
his
face
,
and
his
hand
clasped
,
and
his
head
bent
,
he
command
himself
to
God
,
and
stand
firm
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
cruelly
kill
him
close
to
the
altar
of
St
Bennet
;
and
his
body
fall
upon
the
pavement
,
which
be
dirty
with
his
blood
and
brain
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
awful
thing
to
think
of
the
murder
mortal
,
who
have
so
shower
his
curse
about
,
lie
,
all
disfigure
,
in
the
church
,
where
a
few
lamp
here
and
there
be
but
red
speck
on
a
pall
of
darkness
;
and
to
think
of
the
guilty
knight
ride
away
on
horseback
,
look
over
their
shoulder
at
the
dim
Cathedral
,
and
remember
what
they
have
leave
inside
.
  
<EOS>
part
the
second
    
<EOS>
when
the
King
hear
how
Thomas
a
Becket
have
lose
his
life
in
Canterbury
Cathedral
,
through
the
ferocity
of
the
four
Knights
,
he
be
fill
with
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
some
have
suppose
that
when
the
King
speak
those
hasty
word
,
"
have
I
no
one
here
who
will
deliver
me
from
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
he
wish
,
and
mean
a
becket
to
be
slay
.
 
<EOS>
but
few
thing
be
more
unlikely
;
for
,
besides
that
the
King
be
not
naturally
cruel
(
though
very
passionate
)
,
he
be
wise
,
and
must
have
know
full
well
what
any
stupid
man
in
his
dominion
must
have
know
,
namely
,
that
such
a
murder
would
rouse
the
Pope
and
the
whole
Church
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
send
respectful
messenger
to
the
Pope
,
to
represent
his
innocence
(
except
in
have
utter
the
hasty
word
)
;
and
he
swear
solemnly
and
publicly
to
his
innocence
,
and
contrive
in
time
to
make
his
peace
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
four
guilty
Knights
,
who
flee
into
Yorkshire
,
and
never
again
dare
to
show
themselves
at
Court
,
the
Pope
excommunicate
them
;
and
they
live
miserably
for
some
time
,
shun
by
all
their
countryman
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
they
go
humbly
to
Jerusalem
as
a
penance
,
and
there
die
and
be
bury
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
,
fortunately
for
the
pacifying
of
the
Pope
,
that
an
opportunity
arise
very
soon
after
the
murder
of
a
Becket
,
for
the
King
to
declare
his
power
in
Ireland
---
which
be
an
acceptable
undertaking
to
the
Pope
,
as
the
Irish
,
who
have
be
convert
to
Christianity
by
one
Patricius
(
otherwise
Saint
Patrick
)
long
ago
,
before
any
Pope
exist
,
consider
that
the
Pope
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
them
,
or
they
with
the
Pope
,
and
accordingly
refuse
to
pay
him
Peter
's
Pence
,
or
that
tax
of
a
penny
a
house
which
I
have
elsewhere
mention
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
opportunity
arise
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
Irish
be
,
at
that
time
,
as
barbarous
a
people
as
you
can
well
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
continually
quarrel
and
fight
,
cut
one
another
's
throat
,
slice
one
another
's
nose
,
burn
one
another
's
house
,
carry
away
one
another
's
wife
,
and
commit
all
sort
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
the

THOMOND

have
carry
off
the

<EOS>
there
be
,
in
South
Wales
,
two
other
broken
knight
of
the
same
good
-
for
-
nothing
sort
,
call
ROBERT
FITZ
-
STEPHEN
,
and
MAURICE
FITZ
-
GERALD
.
 
<EOS>
these
three
,
each
with
a
small
band
of
follower
,
take
up
Dermond
's
cause
;
and
it
be
agree
that
if
it
prove
successful
,
Strongbow
should
marry
Dermond
's
daughter
eva
,
and
be
declare
his
heir
.
  
<EOS>
the
train
english
follower
of
these
knight
be
so
superior
in
all
the
discipline
of
battle
to
the
Irish
,
that
they
beat
them
against
immense
superiority
of
number
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
fight
,
early
in
the
war
,
they
cut
off
three
hundred
head
,
and
lay
them
before
Mac
Murrough
;
who
turn
them
every
one
up
with
his
hand
,
rejoice
,
and
,
come
to
one
which
be
the
head
of
a
man
whom
he
have
much
dislike
,
grasp
it
by
the
hair
and
ear
,
and
tear
off
the
nose
and
lip
with
his
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
judge
from
this
,
what
kind
of
a
gentleman
an
irish
King
in
those
time
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
captive
,
all
through
this
war
,
be
horribly
treat
;
the
victorious
party
make
nothing
of
break
their
limb
,
and
cast
them
into
the
sea
from
the
top
of
high
rock
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
midst
of
the
misery
and
cruelty
attendant
on
the
taking
of
Waterford
,
where
the
dead
lie
<EOS>
pile
in
the
street
,
and
the
filthy
gutter
run
with
blood
,
that
Strongbow
married
Eva
.
 
<EOS>
an
odious
marriage
-
company
those
mound
of
corpse
's
must
have
make
,
I
think
,
and
one
quite
worthy
of
the
young
lady
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
He
die
,
after
Waterford
and
Dublin
have
be
take
,
and
various
success
achieve
;
and
Strongbow
become
King
of
Leinster
.
 
<EOS>
now
come
King
Henry
's
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
to
restrain
the
grow
power
of
Strongbow
,
he
himself
repair
to
Dublin
,
as
Strongbow
's
Royal
Master
,
and
deprive
him
of
his
kingdom
,
but
confirm
him
in
the
enjoyment
of
great
possession
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
then
,
hold
state
in
Dublin
,
receive
the
homage
of
nearly
all
the
irish
Kings
and
Chiefs
,
and
so
come
home
again
with
a
great
addition
to
his
reputation
as
Lord
of
Ireland
,
and
with
a
new
claim
on
the
favour
of
the
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
their
reconciliation
be
complete
---
more
easily
and
mildly
by
the
Pope
,
than
the
King
may
have
expect
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
period
of
his
reign
,
when
his
trouble
seem
so
few
and
his
prospect
so
bright
,
those
domestic
misery
begin
which
gradually
make
the
King
the
most
unhappy
of
man
,
reduce
his
great
spirit
,
wear
away
his

break
his

He

within

<EOS>
every

of
Prince
Henry

his

never

peace
with
him
,
their

without
the
consent
and
approval
of
the
Barons

<EOS>
but
,
with
his
fortitude
and
energy
unshaken
,
King
Henry
meet
the
shock
of
these
disaster
with
a
resolved
and
cheerful
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
upon
all
royal
father
who
have
son

to
help
him
,
for
his
cause
be
theirs
;
he
hire

out
of
his

twenty
thousand
man
to
fight
the
false
french
King
,
who
stir
his

and
he
carry
on
the
war
with
such
vigour
,
that
Louis

propose
a

<EOS>
the
conference
be
hold
beneath
an
old
wide

spread
green
elm

tree
,
upon
a
plain
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
It
lead
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
war
recommence
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Richard
begin
his
fighting
career
,
by
lead
an
army
against
his
father
;
but
his
father
beat
him
and
his
army
back
;
and
thousand
of
his
man
would
have
rue
the
day
in
which
they
fight
in
such
a
wicked
cause
,
have
not
the
King
receive
news
of
an
invasion
of
England
by
the
Scots
,
and
promptly
come
home
through
a
great
storm
to
repress
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
whether
he
really
begin
to
fear
that
he
suffer
these
trouble
because
a
becket
have
be
murder
;
or
whether
he
wish
to
rise
in
the
favour
of
the
Pope
,
who
have
now
declare
a
Becket
to
be
a
saint
,
or
in
the
favour
of
his
own
people
,
of
whom
many
believe
that
even
a
Becket
's
senseless
tomb
could
work
miracle
,
I
do
not
know
:
 
but
the
King
no
sooner
land
in
England
than
he
go
straight
to
Canterbury
;
and
when
he
come
within
sight
of
the
distant
Cathedral
,
he
dismount
from
his
horse
,
take
off
his
shoe
,
and
walk
with
bare
and
bleed
foot
to
a
Becket
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
lie
down
on
the
ground
,
lamenting
,
in
the
presence
of
many
people
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
he
go
into
the
Chapter
House
,
and
,
remove
his
clothe
from
his
back
and
shoulder
,
submit
himself
to
be
beat
with
knot
cord
(
not
beat
very
hard
,
I
dare
say
though
)
by
eighty
Priests
,
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
chance
that
on
the
very
day
when
the
King
make
this
curious
exhibition
of
himself
,
a
complete
victory
be
obtain
over
the
Scots
;
which
very
much
delight
the
Priests
,
who
say
that
it
be
win
because
of
his
great
example
of
repentance
.
<EOS>
for
the
priest
in
general
have
find
out
,
since
a
Becket
's
death
,
that
they
admire
him
of
all
thing
---
though
they
have
hate
him
very
cordially
when
he
be
alive
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Flanders
,
who
be
at
the
head
of
the
base
conspiracy
of
the
King
's
undutiful
son
and
their
foreign
friend
,
take
the
opportunity
of
the
King
be
thus
employ
at
home
,
to
lay
siege
to
Rouen
,
the
capital
of
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
King
,
who
be
extraordinarily
quick
and
active
in
all
his
movement
,
be
at
Rouen
,
too
,
before
it
be
suppose
possible
that
he
could
have
leave
England
;
and
there
he
so
defeat
the
say
Earl
of
Flanders
,
that
the
conspirator
propose
peace
,
and
his
bad
son
Henry
and
Geoffrey
submit
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
resist
for
six
week
;
but
,
be
beat
out
of
castle
after
castle
,
he
at
last
submit
too
,
and
his
father
forgave
him
.
  
<EOS>
to
forgive
these
unworthy
prince
be
only
to
afford
them
breathing
-
time
for
new
faithlessness
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
so
false
,
disloyal
,
and
dishonourable
,
that
they
be
no
more
to
be
trust
than
common
thief
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
next
year
,
Prince
Henry
rebel
again
,
and
be
again
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
in
eight
year
more
,
Prince
Richard
rebel
against
his
eld
brother
;
and
Prince
Geoffrey
infamously
say
that
the
brother
could
never
agree
well
together
,
unless
they
be
unite
against
their
father
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
next
year
after
their
reconciliation
by
the
King
,
Prince
Henry
again
rebel
against
his
father
;
and
again
submit
,
swear
to
be
true
;
and
be
again
forgive
;
and
again
rebel
with
Geoffrey
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
end
of
this
perfidious
Prince
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
fall
sick
at
a
french
town
;
and
his
conscience
terribly
reproach
him
with
his
baseness
,
he
send
messenger
to
the
King
his
father
,
implore
him
to
come
and
see
him
,
and
to
forgive
him
for
the
last
time
on
his
bed
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
generous
King
,
who
have
a
royal
and
forgiving
mind
towards
his
child
always
,
would
have
go
;
but
this
Prince
have
be
so
unnatural
,
that
the
nobleman
about
the
King
suspect
treachery
,
and
represent
to
him
that
he
could
not
safely
trust
his
life
with
such
a
traitor
,
though
his
own
eld
son
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
the
King
send
him
a
ring
from
off
his
finger
as
a
token
of
forgiveness
;
and
when
the
Prince
have
kiss
it
,
with
much
grief
and
many
tear
,
and
have
confess
to
those
around
him
how
bad
,
and
wicked
,
and
undutiful
a
son
he
have
be
;
he
say
to
the
attendant
Priests
:
 
"
o
,
tie
a
rope
about
my
body
,
and
draw
me
out
of
bed
,
and
lie
me
down
upon
a
bed
of
ashe
,
that
I
may
die
with
prayer
to
God
in
a
repentant
manner
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
die
,
at
twenty
-
seven
year
old
.
  
<EOS>
three
year
afterwards
,
Prince
Geoffrey
,
be
unhorse
at
a
tournament
,
have
his
brain
trample
out
by
a
crowd
of
horse
pass
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
there
only
remain
Prince
Richard
,
and
Prince
John
---
who
have
grow
to
be
a
young
man
now
,
and
have
solemnly
swear
to

never

;
and
in
another
year
or
so
,
rebel
again
;
and
,
in
the
presence
of
his
father
,
kneel
down
on
his
knee
before
the
King
of
France
;
and
do
the
french
King
homage
:
 
and
declare
that
with
his
aid
he
would
possess
himself
,
by
force
,
of
all
his

<EOS>
and

previous

at
a
brotherly
meeting
underneath
the
old
wide

spread
elm

tree
on

when
they
have
swear
(
like
him
)
to
devote
themselves
to
a
new
Crusade
,
for
the
love
and
honour
of
the
Truth
!
  
<EOS>
Sick
at
heart
,
weary
out
by
the
falsehood
of
his
son
,
and
almost
ready
to
lie
down
and
die
,
the
unhappy
King
who
have
so
long

<EOS>
but

him
;
and
oblige
the
french

one
final
heavy

<EOS>
when
they
bring
him
the
propose
treaty
of
peace
,
in
writing
,
as
he
lie
very
ill
in

,
they

<EOS>
"

"
exclaim
the

in

say
,
"
now

<EOS>
I

"
  
<EOS>
after
a
time

the
french
town
of
Chinon
---
a
town

have
be
fond
of
,
during
many
year

<EOS>
but
he

it

He

the
servile
follower
of
the
Court
have
abandon
the
Conqueror
in
the
hour
of

<EOS>
the

Richard
be
say
in
after
year
,
by
way
of
flattery
,
to
have
the
heart
of
a
Lion
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
far
well
,
I
think
,
to
have
have
the
heart
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
,
whatever
it
be
,
have
cause
to
beat
remorsefully
within
his
breast
,
when
he
come
---
as
he
do
---
into
the
solemn
abbey
,
and
look
on
his
dead
father
's
uncovered
face
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
,
whatever
it
be
,
have
be
a
black
and
perjured
heart
,
in
all
its
dealing
with
the
deceased
King
,
and
more
deficient
in
a
single
touch
of
tenderness
than
any
wild
beast
be
in
the

.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pretty
story
tell
of
this
Reign
,
call
the
story
of
FAIR
ROSAMOND
.
 
<EOS>
It
relate
how
the
king
dote
on
Fair
Rosamond
,
who
be
the
lovely
girl
in
all
the
world
;
and
how
he
have
a
beautiful
Bower
build
for
her
in
a
Park
at
Woodstock
;
and
how
it
be
erect
in
a
labyrinth
,
and
could
only
be
find
by
a
clue
of
silk
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
bad
Queen
Eleanor
,
become
jealous
of
Fair
Rosamond
,
find
out
the
secret
of
the
clue
,
and
one
day
,
appear
before
her
,
with
a
dagger
and
a
cup
of
poison
,
and
leave
her
to
the
choice
between
those
death
.
 
<EOS>
how
Fair
Rosamond
,
after
shed
many
piteous
tear
and
offer
many
useless
prayer
to
the
cruel
Queen
,
take
the
poison
,
and
fall
dead
in
the
midst
of
the
beautiful
bower
,
while
the
unconscious
bird
sing
gaily
all
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
a
fair
rosamond
,
and
she
be
(
I
dare
say
)
<EOS>
the
lovely
girl
in
all
the
world
,
and
the
King
be
certainly
very
fond
of
her
,
and
the
bad
Queen
Eleanor
be
certainly
make
jealous
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
---
I
say
afraid
,
because
I
like
the
story
so
much
---
that
there
be
no
bower
,
no
labyrinth
,
no
silken
clue
,
no
dagger
,
no
poison
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
fair
Rosamond
retire
to
a
nunnery
near
Oxford
,
and
die
there
,
peaceably
;
her
sister
-
nun
hang
a
silken
drapery
over
her
tomb
,
and
often
dress
it
with
flower
,
in
remembrance
of
the
youth
and
beauty
that
have
enchant
the
King
when
he
too
be
young
,
and
when
his
life
lie
fair
before
him
.

It
be
dark
and
end
now

fade

<EOS>
He
have
be

as

a

but
,
the
moment
he
become
a

rebel
<EOS>

he
find
out
that
rebellion
be
a
great
wickedness

in
the
heat
of
this
pious
discovery

he
punish
all
the
lead
people
who
have
befriend
him
against
his

<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
have
do
anything
that
would
have
be
a
well
instance
of
his
real
nature
,
or
a
well
warning
to
fawner

not

in
lion

He
likewise
put
his

lock
him
up
in
a
dungeon
from
which
he
be
not
set
free
until
he
have
relinquish
,
not
only
all
the
Crown

but
all
his

<EOS>
so

of
the

of
this
wretched

the

have
issue
a

as
they

assemble

bring

some

venture
down

Westminster

with

It

command
the
unbelieving

<EOS>
thereupon
the

rush
through

narrow

slaughter
all
the

they
meet

when

the

<EOS>
King
Richard
carry
on
the
war
without
him
;
and
remain
in
the
East
,
meet
with
a
variety
of
adventure
,
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
every
night
when
his

be
on

come

the

cry
out
three

the

all
the

marching

desert

with

animate

with

.
 
<EOS>
sickness
and
death
,
battle
and
wound
,
be
always
among
them
;
but
through
every
difficulty
King
Richard
fight
like
a
giant
,
and
work
like
a
common
labourer
.
 
<EOS>
long
and
long
after
he
be
quiet
in
his
grave

his
terrible
battle
-
axe
,
with
twenty
english
pound
of
english
steel
in
its
mighty
head
,
be
a
legend
among

and
when
all
the
Saracen
and
christian
host
have
be
dust
for
many
a
year
,
if
a
Saracen
horse
start
at
any
object
by
the
wayside
,
his
rider
would
exclaim

"
what
dost
thou
fear

Fool

<EOS>
Dost
thou
think
King
Richard
be
behind
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
one
admire
this
King
's
renown
for
bravery
more
than
Saladin
himself
,
who
be
a
generous
and
gallant
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
when
Richard
lie
ill
of
a
fever
,
Saladin
send
him
fresh
fruit
from
Damascus
,
and
snow
from
the
mountain
-
top
.
 
<EOS>
courtly
message
and
compliment
be
frequently
exchange
between
them
---
and
then
King
Richard
would
mount
his
horse
and
kill
as
many
Saracens
as
he
could
;
and
Saladin
would
mount
his
,
and
kill
as
many
Christians
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
King
Richard
fight
to
his
heart
's
content
at
Arsoof
and
at
Jaffa
;
and
find
himself
with
nothing
exciting
to
do
at
Ascalon
,
except
to
rebuild
,
for
his
own
defence
,
some
fortification
there
which
the
Saracens
have
destroy
,
he
kick
his
ally
the
Duke
of
Austria
,
for
be
too
proud
to
work
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
army
at
last
come
within
sight
of
the
Holy
City
of
Jerusalem
;
but
,
be
then
a
mere
nest
of
jealousy
,
and
quarrelling
and
fight
,
soon
retire
,
and
agree
with
the
Saracens
upon
a
truce
for
three
year
,
three
month
,
three
day
,
and
three
hour
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
English
Christians
,
protect
by
the
noble
Saladin
from
Saracen
revenge
,
visit
Our
Saviour
's
tomb
;
and
then
King
Richard
embark
with
a
small
force
at
Acre
to
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
shipwreck
in
the
Adriatic
Sea
,
and
be
fain
to
pass
through
Germany
,
under
an
assumed
name
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
many
people
in
Germany
who
have
serve
in
the
Holy
Land
under
that
proud
Duke
of
Austria
who
have
be
kick
;
and
some
of
them
,
easily
recognise
a
man
so
remarkable
as
King
Richard
,
carry
their
intelligence
to
the
kick
Duke
,
who
straightway
take
him
prisoner
at
a
little
inn
near
Vienna
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
's
master
the
Emperor
of
Germany
,
and
the
King
of
France
,
be
equally
delighted
to
have
<EOS>
so
troublesome
a
monarch
in
safe
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
Friendships
which
be
found
on
a
partnership
in
do
wrong
,
be
never
true
;
and
the
King
of
France
be
now
quite
as
heartily
King
Richard
's
foe
,
as
he
have
ever
be
his
friend
in
his
unnatural
conduct
to
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
monstrously
pretend
that
King
Richard
have
design
to
poison
him
in
the
East
;
he
charge
him
with
have
murder
,
there
,
a
man
whom
he
have
in
truth
befriend
;
he
bribe
the
Emperor
of
Germany
to
keep
him
close
prisoner
;
and
,
finally
,
through
the
plotting
of
these
two
prince
,
Richard
be
bring
before
the
german
legislature
,
charge
with
the
forego
crime
,
and
many
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
defend
himself
so
well
,
that
many
of
the
assembly
be
move
to
tear
by
his
eloquence
and
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
decide
that
he
should
be
treat
,
during
the
rest
of
his
captivity
,
in
a
manner
more
become
his
dignity
than
he
have
be
,
and
that
he
should
be
set
free
on
the
payment
of
a
heavy
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
this
ransom
the
english
people
willingly
raise
.
<EOS>
when
Queen
Eleanor
take
it
over
to
Germany
,
it
be
at
first
evade
and
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
appeal
to
the
honour
of
all
the
prince
of
the
German
Empire
in
behalf
of
her
son
,
and
appeal
so
well
that
it
be
accept
,
and
the
King
release
.
 
<EOS>
thereupon
,
the
King
of
France
write
to
Prince
John
---
"
take
care
of
thyself

<EOS>
the
devil
be
unchained
!
"
  
<EOS>
Prince
John
have
reason
to
fear
his
brother
,
for
he
have
be
a
traitor
to
him
in
his
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
secretly
join
the
french
King
;
have
vow
to
the
english
noble
and
people
that
his
brother
be
dead
;
and
have
vainly
try
to
seize
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
in
France
,
at
a
place
call
Evreux
.
 
<EOS>
be
the
mean
and
basest
of
man
,
he
contrive
a
mean
and
base
expedient
for
make
himself
acceptable
to
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
He
invite
the
french
officer
of
the
garrison
in
that
town
to
dinner
,
murder
them
all
,
and
then
take
the
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
recommendation
to
the
good
will
of
a
lion
-
hearte
monarch
,
he
hasten
to
King
Richard
,
fall
on
his
knee
before
him
,
and
obtain
the
intercession
of
Queen
Eleanor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
him
,
"
say
the
King
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
forget
the
injury
he
have
do
me
,
as
easily
as
I
know
he
will
forget
my
pardon
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
King
Richard
be
in
Sicily
,
there
have
be
trouble
in
his
dominion
at
home
:
 
one
of
the
bishop
whom
he
have
leave
in
charge
thereof
,
arrest
the
other
;
and
make
,
in
his
pride
and
ambition
,
as
great
a
show
as
if
he
be
King
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
King
hearing
of
it
at
Messina
,
and
appoint
a
new
Regency
,
this
LONGCHAMP
(
for
that
be
his
name
)
have
flee
to
France
in
a
woman
's
dress
,
and
have
there
be
encourage
and
support
by
the
french
King
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
these
cause
of
offence
against
Philip
in
his
mind
,
King
Richard
have
no
sooner
be
welcome
home
by
his
enthusiastic
subject
with
great
display
and
splendour
,
and
have
no
sooner
be
crown
afresh
at
Winchester
,
than
he
resolve
to
show
the
french
King
that
the
Devil
be
unchained
indeed
,
and
make
war
against
him
with
great
fury
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
fresh
trouble
at
home
about
this
time
,
arise
out
of
the
discontent
of
the
poor
people
,
who
complain
that
they
be
far
more
heavily
tax
than
the
rich
,
and
who
find
a
spirited
champion
in
WILLIAM
FITZ
-
OSBERT
,
call
LONGBEARD
.
 
<EOS>
He
become
the
leader
of
a
secret
society
,
comprise
fifty
thousand
man
;
he
be
seize
by
surprise
;
he
stab
the
citizen
who
first
lay
hand
upon
him
;
and
retreat
,
bravely
fight
,
to
a
church
,
which
he
maintain
four
day
,
until
he
be
dislodge
by
fire
,
and
run
through
the
body
as
he
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
kill
,
though
;
for
he
be
drag
,
half
dead
,
at
the
tail
of
a
horse
to
Smithfield
,
and
there
hang
.
<EOS>
death
be
long
a
favourite
remedy
for
silence
the
people
's
advocate
;
but
as
we
go
on
with
this
history
,
I
fancy
we
shall
find
them
difficult
to
make
an
end
of
,
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
the
french
war
,
delay
occasionally
by
a
truce
,
be
still
in
progress
when
a
certain
Lord
name
VIDOMAR
,
Viscount
of
Limoges
,
chance
to
find
in
his
ground
a
treasure
of
ancient
coin
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
King
's
vassal
,
he
send
the
King
half
of
it
;
but
the
King
claim
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
the
lord
refuse
to
yield
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
besiege
the
lord
in
his
castle
,
swear
that
he
would
take
the
castle
by
storm
,
and
hang
every
man
of
its
defender
on
the
battlement
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
strange
old
song
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
to
the
effect
that
in
limoge
an
arrow
would
be
make
by
which
King
Richard
would
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
BERTRAND
DE
GOURDON
,
a
young
man
who
be
one
of
the
defender
of
the
castle
,
have
often
sing
it
or
hear
it
sing
of
a
winter
night
,
and
remember
it
when
he
see
,
from
his
post
upon
the
rampart
,
the
King
attend
only
by
his
chief
officer
ride
below
the
wall
survey
the
place

<EOS>
He
draw
an
arrow
to
the
head
,
take
steady
aim
,
say
between
his
tooth
,
"
<EOS>
now
I
pray
God
speed
thee
<EOS>
well
,
arrow
!
<EOS>
"
discharge
it
,
and
strike
the
King
in
the
left
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
although
the
wound
be
not
at
first
consider
dangerous
,
it
be
severe
enough
to
cause
the
King
to
retire
to
his
tent
,
and
direct
the
assault
to
be
make
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
castle
be
take
;
and
every
man
of
its
defender
be
hang
,
as
the
King
have
swear
all
should
be
,
except
Bertrand
de
Gourdon
,
who
be
reserve
until
the
royal
pleasure
respect
him
should

<EOS>
by
that
time
unskilful
treatment
have
make
the
wound
mortal
and
the
King
know
that
he
be
die

<EOS>
He
direct
Bertrand
to
be
bring
into
his
tent

<EOS>
the
young

be
bring
there
,
heavily
chain
,
King

<EOS>
He
look

as
steadily

at
the

<EOS>
"
Knave

"
say
King

<EOS>
"
what

I

to
thee
that

"
  
<EOS>
"
what

"
with

Thou

"
  
<EOS>
again
the
king
look
at
the
young

steadily
.
 
<EOS>
again
the
young

look
steadily
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
some
remembrance
of
his
generous
enemy
Saladin
,
who
be
not
a
Christian

come
into
the
mind
of
the
die
King

<EOS>
"
Youth

<EOS>
he

"
I

go
unhurt

<EOS>
then

turn

the

he
receive
the
wound

King
Richard
say
:
  
"
take
off
his

give
him
a
hundred
shilling

and
let

<EOS>
He
sink
down
on
his
couch

and
a
dark
mist
seem
in
his
weaken
eye
to
fill
the
tent
wherein
he
have
so
often
rest

and
he
die

<EOS>
His
age

forty

<EOS>
His

not

for

flay
Bertrand

alive

him

<EOS>
there
be
an
old
tune
yet
know
---
a
sorrowful
air
will
sometimes
outlive
many
generation
of
strong
man
,
and
even
last
longer
than
battle
-
axis
with
twenty
pound

by

this

<EOS>
BLONDEL
,
a
favourite
Minstrel
of
King
Richard
,
as
the
story
relate
,
faithfully
seek
his
royal
master
,
go
singe
it
outside
the
gloomy
wall
of
many
foreign
fortress
and
prison
;
until
at
last
he
hear
it
echo
from
within
a
dungeon
,
and
know
the
voice
,
and
cry
out
in
ecstasy
,
"
o
Richard
,
o
my
king
!
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
it
,
if
you
like
;
it
would
be
easy
to
believe
bad
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
be
himself
a
Minstrel
and
a
poet
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
not
be
a
Prince
too
,
he
may
have
be
a
well
man
perhaps
,
and
may
have
go
out
of
the
world
with
less
bloodshed
and
waste
of
life
to
answer
for
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
King
John
,
Called
Lackland
    
at
two
-
and
-
thirty
year
of
age
<EOS>
,
JOHN
become
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
His
pretty
little
nephew
ARTHUR
have
the
good
claim
to
the
throne
;
but
John
seize
the
treasure
,
and
make
fine
promise
to
the
nobility
,
and
get
himself
crown
at
Westminster
within
a
few
week
after
his
brother
Richard
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
the
crown
could
possibly
have
be
put
upon
the
head
of
a
mean
coward
,
or
a
more
detestable
villain
,
if
England
have
be
search
from
end
to
end
to
find
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
french
King
,
Philip
,
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
John
to
his
new
dignity
,
and
declare
in
favour
of
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
suppose
that
he
have
any
generosity
of
feeling
for
the
fatherless
boy
;
it
merely
suit
his
ambitious
scheme
to
oppose
the
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
so
John
and
the
french
King
go
to
war
about
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
handsome
boy
,
at
that
time
only
twelve
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
bear
when
his
father
,
Geoffrey
,
have
his
brain
trample
out
at
the
tournament
;
and
,
besides
the
misfortune
of
never
have
know
a
father
's
guidance
and
protection
,
he
have
the
additional
misfortune
to
have
a
foolish
mother
(
CONSTANCE
by
name
)
,
<EOS>
lately
married
to
her
third
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
Arthur
,
upon
John
's
accession
,
to
the
french
King
,
who
pretend
to
be
very
much
his
friend
,
and
who
make
him
a
Knight
,
and
promise

so
little
about
him
in
reality
,
that
find
it
his
interest
to
make
peace
with
King
John
for
a
time
,
he
do
so
without
the
least
consideration
for
the
poor
little
Prince
,
and
heartlessly
sacrifice
all
his
interest
.
  
<EOS>
young
Arthur
,
for
two
year
afterwards
,
live
quietly
;
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
his
mother
die
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
french
King
then
find
it
his
interest
to
quarrel
with
King
John
again
,
again
make
Arthur
his
pretence
,
and
invite
the
orphan
boy
to
court
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
your
right
,
Prince
,
"
say
the
french
King
,
"
and
you
would
like
to
be
a
king
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
truly
,
"
say
Prince
Arthur
,
"
I
should
greatly
like
to
be
a
king
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Philip
,
"
you
shall
have
two
hundred
gentleman
who
be
Knights
of
mine
,
and
with
them
you
shall
go
to
win
back
the
province
belong
to
you
,
of
which
your
uncle
,
the
usurping
King
of
England
,
have
take
possession
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
,
meanwhile
,
will
head
a
force
against
him
in
Normandy
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Arthur
be
so
flattered
and
so
grateful
that
he
sign
a
treaty
with
the
crafty
french
King
,
agree
to
consider
him
his
superior
Lord
,
and
that
the
french
King
should
keep
for
himself
whatever
he
could
take
from
King
John
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
King
John
be
so
bad
in
all
way
,
and
King
Philip
be
so
perfidious
,
that
Arthur
,
between
the
two
,
may
as
well
have
be
a
lamb
between
a
fox
and
a
wolf
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
be
so
young
,
he
be
ardent
and
flush
with
hope
;
and
,
<EOS>
when
the
people
of
Brittany
(
which
be
his
inheritance
)
send
him
five
hundred
more
knight
and
five
thousand
foot
soldier
,
he
believe
his
fortune
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
of
Brittany
have
be
fond
of
him
from
his
birth
,
and
have
request
that
he
may
be
call
Arthur
,
in
remembrance
of
that
dimly
-
famous
English
Arthur
,
of
whom
I
tell
you
early
in
this
book
,
whom
they
believe
to
have
be
the
brave
friend
and
companion
of
an
old
king
of
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
tale
among
them
about
a
prophet
call
MERLIN
(
of
the
same
old
time
)
,
who
have
foretold
that
their
own
King
should
be
restore
to
them
after
hundred
of
year
;
and
they
believe
that
the
prophecy
would
be
fulfil
in
Arthur
;
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
would
rule
them
with
a
crown
of
Brittany
upon
his
head
;
and
when
neither
King
of
France
nor
King
of
England
would
have
any
power
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
Arthur
find
himself
ride
in
a
glittering
suit
of
armour
on
a
richly
caparison
horse
,
at
the
head
of
his
train
of
knight
and
soldier
,
he
begin
to
believe
this
too
,
and
to
consider
old
Merlin
a
very
superior
prophet
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
---
how
could
he
,
be
so
innocent
and
inexperienced
?
---
that
his
little
army
be
a
mere
nothing
against
the
power
of
the
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
french
King
know
it
;
but
the
poor
boy
's
fate
be
little
to
him
,
so
that
the
King
of
England
be
worry
and
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
King
Philip
go
his
way
into
Normandy
and
Prince
Arthur
go
his
way
towards
Mirebeau
,
a
french
town
near
Poictiers
,
both
very
well
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
Prince
Arthur
go
to
attack
the
town
of
Mirebeau
,
because
his
grandmother
Eleanor
,
who
have
so
often
make
her
appearance
in
this
history
(
and
who
have
always
be
his
mother
's
enemy
)
,
be
live
there
,
and
because
his
Knights
say
,
"
Prince
,
if
you
can
take
her
prisoner
,
you
will
be
able
to
bring
the
King
your
uncle
to
term
!
"
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
to
be
easily
take
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
old
enough
by
this
time
---
eighty
<EOS>
---
but
she
be
as
full
of
stratagem
as
she
be
full
of
year
and
wickedness
.
 
<EOS>
receive
intelligence
of
young
Arthur
's
approach
,
she
shut
herself
up
in
a
high
tower
,
and
encourage
her
soldier
to
defend
it
like
man
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Arthur
with
his
little
army
besiege
the
high
tower
.
 
<EOS>
King
John
,
hear
how
matter
stand
,
come
up
to
the
rescue
,
with
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
so
here
be
a
strange
family
-
party
!
 
<EOS>
the
boy
-
Prince
besiege
his
grandmother
,
and
his
uncle
besiege
him
!
  
<EOS>
this
position
of
affair
do
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
one
summer
night
King
John
,
by
treachery
,
get
his
man
into
the
town
,
surprise
Prince
Arthur
's
force
,
take
two
hundred
of
his

,
and
seize

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
Prince

the
castle
of
Falaise
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
he
be
in
prison
at
that
castle
,
mournfully
think
it
strange
that
one
so
young
should
be
in
so
much
trouble
,
and
look
out
of
the
small
window
in
the
deep
dark
wall
,
at
the
summer
sky
and
the
bird
,
the
door
be
softly
open
,
and
he
see
his
uncle
the
King
stand
in
the
shadow
of
the
archway
,
look
very
grim
.
  
<EOS>
"
Arthur
,
"
say
the
King
,
with
his
wicked
eye
more
on
the
stone
floor
than
on
his
nephew
,
"
will
you
not
trust
to
the
gentleness
,
the
friendship
,
and
the
truthfulness
of
your
loving
uncle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
my
loving
uncle
that
,
"
reply
the
boy
,
"
when
he
do
me
right
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
restore
to
me
my
kingdom
of
England
,
and
then
come
to
me
and
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
King
look
at
him
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
keep
that
boy
close
prisoner
,
"
say
he
to
the
warden
of
the
castle
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
the
King
take
secret
counsel
with
the
bad
of
his
noble
how
the
Prince
be
to
be
get
rid
of
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
,
"
put
out
his
eye
and
keep
him
in
prison
,
as
Robort
of
Normandy
be
keep

"
 
<EOS>
other
say

"
have

"
have
him
hang

"
 
other

have
him
poison

"
  
<EOS>
King
John
,
feel
that
in
any
case
,
whatever
be
do
afterwards
,
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
mind
to
have
those
handsome
eye

out
that
have
look
at
him
so
proudly
while
his

be
blink
at

stone
floor
,
send
certain
ruffian
to
falaise
to
blind
the
boy
with
red
-
hot
iron
.
 
<EOS>
but
Arthur
so
pathetically
entreat
them
,
and
shed
such
piteous
tear
,
and
so
appeal
to
hubert
DE
BOURG
(

BURGH

,
the
warden
of
the
castle
,
who
have
a
love

to

eternal
honour
he
prevent
the

and
,
at
his

risk
,
send

<EOS>
the
chafed
and
disappoint
King
bethink
himself
of
the
stabbing
suggestion
next
,
and
,
with
his
shuffling
manner

his
cruel
face

propose
it
to
one
William

<EOS>
"
I
be
a

and
not
an
executioner
,
"
say
William
de
Bray
,
and
leave
the
presence
with
disdain

<EOS>
but
it
be
not
difficult
for
a
king
to
hire
a
murderer
in
those
day
.
 
<EOS>
King
John
find
one

down

<EOS>
King

next
good
thing
to
man
<EOS>
,
King
John
spare
no
means
of
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
on
foot
another
oppressing
and
torturing
of
the
unhappy
Jews
(
which
be
quite
in
his
way
)
,
and
invent
a
new
punishment
for
one
wealthy
Jew
of
Bristol
.
 
<EOS>
until
such
time
as
that
Jew
should
produce
a
certain
large
sum
of
money
,
the
King
sentence
him
to
be
imprison
,
and
,
every
day
,
to
have
one
tooth
violently
wrench
out
of
his
head
---
begin
with
the
double
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
for
seven
day
,
the
oppressed
man
bear
the
daily
pain
and
lose
the
daily
tooth
;
but
,
on
the
eighth
,
he
pay
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
treasure
raise
in
such
way
,
the
King
make
an
expedition
into
Ireland
,
where
some
english
noble
have
revolt
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
very
few
place
from
which
he
do
not
run
away
;
because
no
resistance
be
show
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
another
expedition
into
Wales
---
<EOS>
whence
he
do
run
away
in
the
end
:
 
but
not
before
he
have
get
from
the
Welsh
people
,
as
hostage
,
twenty
-
seven
young
man
of
the
good
family
;
every
one
of
whom
he
cause
to
be
slay
in
the
following
year
.
  
<EOS>
to
Interdict
and
Excommunication
,
the
Pope
now
add
his
last
sentence
;
Deposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
proclaim
John
no
longer
King
,
absolve
all
his
subject
from
their
allegiance
,
and
send
Stephen
Langton
and
other
to
the
King
of
France
to
tell
him
that
,
if
he
would
invade
England
,
he
should
be
forgive
all
his
sin
---
at
least
,
should
be
forgive
them
by
the
Pope
,
if
that
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
nothing
that
King
Philip
desire
more
than
to
invade
England
,
he
collect
a
great
army
at
Rouen
,
and
a
fleet
of
seventeen
hundred
ship
to
bring
them
over
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
english
people
,
however
bitterly
they
hate
the
King
,
be
not
a
people
to
suffer
invasion
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
They
flock
to
Dover
,
where
the
english
standard
be
,
in
such
great
number
to
enrol
themselves
as
defender
of
their
native
land
,
that
there
be
not
provision
for
them
,
and
the
King
could
only
select
and
retain
sixty
thousand
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
this
crisis
,
the
Pope
,
who
have
his
own
reason
for
object
to
either
King
John
or
King
Philip
be
too
powerful
,
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
He
entrust
a
legate
,
whose
name
be
PANDOLF
,
with
the
easy
task
of
frighten
King
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
him
to
the
English
Camp
,
from
France
,
to
terrify
him
with
exaggeration
of
King
Philip
's
power
,
and
his
own
weakness
in
the
discontent
of
the
English
Barons
and
people
.
 
<EOS>
Pandolf
discharge
his
commission
so
well
,
that
King
John
,
in
a
wretched
panic
,
consent
to
acknowledge
Stephen
Langton
;
to
resign
his
kingdom
"
to
God
,
Saint
Peter
,
and
Saint
Paul
"
---
which
mean
the
Pope
;
and
to
hold
it
,
ever
afterwards
,
by
the
Pope
's
leave
,
on
payment
of
an
annual
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
shameful
contract
he
publicly
bind
himself
in
the
church
of
the
Knights
Templars
at
Dover
:
 
where
he
lay
at
the
legate
's
foot
a
part
of
the
tribute
,
which
the
legate
haughtily
trample
upon
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
do
say
,
that
this
be
merely
a
genteel
flourish
,
and
that
he
be
afterwards
see
to
pick
it
up
and
pocket
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
unfortunate
prophet
,
the
name
of
Peter
,
who
have
greatly
increase
King
John
's
terror
by
predict
that
he
would
be
unknighte
(
which
the
King
suppose
to
signify
that
he
would
die
)
before
the
Feast
of
the
ascension
should
be
past
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
day
after
this
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
next
morning
come
,
and
the
King
,
who
have
be
tremble
all
night
,
find
himself
alive
and
safe
,
he
order
the
prophet
---
and
his
son
too
---
to
be
drag
through
the
street
at
the
tail
of
horse
,
and
then
hang
,
for
have
frighten
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
King
John
have
now
submit
,
the
Pope
,
to
King
Philip
's
great
astonishment
,
take
him
under
his
protection
,
and
inform
King
Philip
that
he
find
he
could
not
give
him
leave
to
invade
England
.
<EOS>
the
angry
Philip
resolve
to
do
it
without
his
leave
but
he
gain
nothing
and
lose
much
;
for
,
the
English
,
command
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
go
over
,
in
five
hundred
ship
,
to
the
french
coast
,
before
the
french
fleet
have
sail
away
from
it
,
and
utterly
defeat
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
the
Pope
then
take
off
his
three
sentence
,
one
after
another
,
and
empower
Stephen
Langton
publicly
to
receive
King
John
into
the
favour
of
the
Church
again
,
and
to
ask
him
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
who
hate
Langton
with
all
his
might
and
main
---
<EOS>
and
with
reason
too
,
for
he
be
a
great
and
a
good
man
,
with
whom
such
a
King
could
have
no
sympathy
---
pretend
to
cry
and
to
be
very
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
difficulty
about
settle
how
much
the
King
should
pay
as
a
recompense
to
the
clergy
for
the
loss
he
have
cause
them
;
but
,
the
end
of
it
be
,
that
the
superior
clergy
get
a
good
deal
,
and
the
inferior
clergy
get
little
or
nothing
---
<EOS>
which
have
also
happen
since
King
John
's
time
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
when
all
these
matter
be
arrange
,
the
King
in
his
triumph
become
more
fierce
,
and
false
,
and
insolent
to
all
around
him
than
he
have
ever
be
.
 
<EOS>
an
alliance
of
sovereign
against
King
Philip
,
give
him
an
opportunity
of
land
an
army
in
France
;
with
which
he
even
take
a
town
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
french
King
's
gain
a
great
victory
,
he
run
away
,
of
course
,
and
make
a
truce
for
five
year
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
time
approach
when
he
be
to
be
still
further
humble
,
and
make
to
feel
,
if
he
could
feel
anything
,
what
a
wretched
creature
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
man
in
the
world
,
Stephen
Langton
seem
raise
up
by
Heaven
to
oppose
and
subdue
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
ruthlessly
burn
and
destroy
the
property
of
his
own
subject
,
because
their
Lords
,
the
baron
,
would
not
serve
him
abroad
,
Stephen
Langton
fearlessly
reprove
and
threaten
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
swear
to
restore
the
law
of
King
Edward
,
or
the
law
of
King
Henry
<EOS>
the
first
,
Stephen
Langton
know
his
falsehood
,
and
pursue
him
through
all
his
evasion
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
baron
meet
at
the
abbey
of
Saint
Edmund's
-
Bury
,
to
consider
their
wrong
and
the
King
's
oppression
,
Stephen
Langton
rouse
them
by
his
fervid
word
to
demand
a
solemn
charter
of
right
and
liberty
from
their
perjure
master
,
and
to
swear
,
one
by
one
,
on
the
High
Altar
,
that
they
would
have
it
,
or
would
wage
war
against
him
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
King
hide
himself
in
London
from
the
Barons
,
and
be
at
last
oblige
to
receive
them
,
they
tell
him
roundly
they
would
not
believe
him
unless
Stephen
Langton
become
a
surety
that
he
would
keep
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
take
the
Cross
to
invest
himself
with
some
interest
,
and
belong
to
something
that
be
receive
with
favour
,
Stephen
Langton
be
still
immovable
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
appeal
to
the
Pope
,
and
the
Pope
write
to
Stephen
Langton
in
behalf
of
his
new
favourite
,
Stephen
Langton
be
deaf
,
even
to
the
Pope
himself
,
and
see
before
him
nothing
but
the
welfare
of
England
and
the
crime
of
the
English
King
.
  
<EOS>
at
Easter

time
,
the
Barons
assemble
at
Stamford
,
in
Lincolnshire
,
in
proud
array

and
,
march
near

<EOS>
on
that
great
day
,
and
in
that
great
company
,
the
King
sign
MAGNA
CHARTA
---
the
great
charter
of
England
---
by
which
he
pledge
himself
to
maintain
the
Church
in
its
right
;
to
relieve
the
baron
of
oppressive
obligation
as
vassal
of
the
Crown
---
of
which
the
Barons
,
in
their
turn
,
pledge
themselves
to
relieve
their
vassal
,
the
people
;
to
respect
the
liberty
of
London
and
all
other
city
and
borough
;
to
protect
foreign
merchant
who
come
to
England
;
to

no
man
without
a
fair
trial
;
and
to
sell
,
delay
,
or
deny
justice
to
none
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
Barons
know
his
falsehood
<EOS>
well
,
they
further
require
,
as
their
security
,
that
he
should
send
out
of
his
kingdom
all
his
foreign
troop
;
that
for
two
month
they
should
hold
possession
of
the
city
of
London
,
and
Stephen
Langton
of
the
Tower
;
and
that
five
-
and
-
twenty
of
their
body
,
choose
by
themselves
,
should
be
a
lawful
committee
to
watch
the
keeping
of
the
charter
,
and
to
make
war
upon
him
if
he
break
it
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
he
be
oblige
to
yield
.
 
<EOS>
He
sign
the
charter
with
a
smile
,
and
,
if
he
could
have
look
agreeable
,
would
have
do
so
,
as
he
depart
from
the
splendid
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
get
home
to
Windsor
Castle
,
he
be
quite
a
madman
in
his
helpless
fury
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
break
the
charter
immediately
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
He
send
abroad
for
foreign
soldier
,
and
send
to
the
Pope
for
help
,
and
plot
to
take
London
by
surprise
,
while
the
Barons
should
be
hold
a
great
tournament
at
Stamford
,
which
they
have
agree
to
hold
there
as
a
celebration
of
the
charter
.
 
<EOS>
the
Barons
,
however
,
find
him
out
and
put
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
Barons
desire
to
see
him
and
tax
him
with
his
treachery
,
he
make
number
of
appointment
with
them
,
and
keep
none
,
and
shift
from
place
to
place
,
and
be
constantly
sneak
and
skulk
about
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
appear
at
Dover
,
to
join
his
foreign
soldier
,
of
whom
number
come
into
his
pay
;
and
with
them
he
besiege
and
take
Rochester
Castle
,
which
be
occupy
by
knight
and
soldier
of
the
Barons
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
hang
them
every
one
;
but
the
leader
of
the
foreign
soldier
,
fearful
of
what
the
english
people
may
afterwards
do
to
him
,
interfere
to
save
the
knight
;
therefore
the
king
be
fain
to
satisfy
his
vengeance
with
the
death
of
all
the
common
man
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
send
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
with
one
portion
of
his
army
,
to
ravage
the
eastern
part
of
his
own
dominion
,
while
he
carry
fire
and
slaughter
into
the
northern
part
;
torturing
,
plunder
,
kill
,
and
inflict
every
possible
cruelty
upon
the
people
;
and
,
every
morning
,
set
a
worthy
example
to
his
man
by
set
fire
,
with
his
own
monster
-
hand
,
to
the
house
where
he
have
sleep
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
;
for
the
Pope
,
come
to
the
aid
of
his
precious
friend
,
lay
the
kingdom
under
an
Interdict
again
,
because
the
people
take
part
with
the
Barons
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
much
matter
,
for
the
people
have
grow
so
used
to
it
now
,
that
they
have
begin
to
think
nothing
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
occur
to
them
---
perhaps
to
Stephen
Langton
too
---
that
they
could
keep
their
church
open
,
and
re
their
bell
,
without
the
Pope
's
permission
as
well
as
with
it
.
<EOS>
so
,
they
try
the
experiment
---
and
find
that
it
succeed
perfectly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
impossible
to
bear
the
country
,
as
a
wilderness
of
cruelty
,
or
long
to
hold
any
term
with
such
a
forsworn
outlaw
of
a
King
,
the
baron
send
to
Louis
,
son
of
the
french
monarch
,
to
offer
him
the
english
crown
.
 
<EOS>
care
as
little
for
the
Pope
's
excommunication
of
him
<EOS>
if
he
accept
the
offer
,
as
it
be
possible
his
father
may
have
care
for
the
Pope
's
forgiveness
of
his
sin
,
he
land
at
Sandwich
(
King
John
immediately
run
away
from
Dover
,
where
he
happen
to
be
)
,
and

It

EARL
HUBERT
DE

<EOS>
these
two
personage
have
from

soon
become
enemy

<EOS>
when
the

Peter
de

find
that
Hubert

for
nearly
ten
year
afterwards
Hubert

full
sway
alone
.
  
<EOS>
but
ten
year
be
a
long
time
to
hold
the
favour
of
a
King
.
 
<EOS>
this
King
,
too
,
as
he
grow
up
,
show
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
father
,
in
feebleness
,
inconsistency
,
and
irresolution
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
that
can
be
say
of
him
be
that
he
be
not
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
De
Roches
come
home
again
,
after
ten
year
,
and
be
a
novelty

the
King
begin
to
favour
him
and
to
look
coldly
on
Hubert

<EOS>
want
money
besides

make
Hubert
rich

he
begin

dislike
Hubert

at
last
he
be
make
to
believe
,
or
pretend
to
believe
,
that
Hubert
have
misappropriate
some
of
the
royal
treasure
;
and
order
him
to
furnish
an
account
of
all
he
have
do
in
his
administration
.
<EOS>
besides
which
,
the
foolish
charge
be
bring
against
Hubert
that
he
have
make
himself
the
King
's
favourite
by
magic
.
 
<EOS>
Hubert
very
well
know
that
he
could
never
defend
himself
against
such
nonsense
,
and
that
his
old
enemy
must
be
determine
on
his
ruin
,
instead
of
answer
the
charge
flee
to
Merton
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
King
,
in
a
violent
passion
,
send
for
the
Mayor
of
London

say
to
the

,
"

the

post
off
to
do
it
,
but
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
(
who
be
a
friend
of
Hubert
's
)
warn
the
King
that
an
abbey
be
a
sacred
place
,
and
that
if
he
commit
any
violence
there
,
he
must
answer
for
it
to
the
Church
,
the
King
change
his
mind
and
call
the
Mayor
back
,
and
declare
that
Hubert
should
have
four
month
to
prepare
his
defence
,

should
be
safe

free
during
that
time

almost

They

the

<EOS>
the

They
knock

more
happily

the

<EOS>
the

of
Earl
Hubert

<EOS>
the
noble

who
have
rise
in
revolt
,
be
stir
up
to
rebellion
by
the
overbearing
conduct
of
the
Bishop

Winchester
,
who
,
find
that
the
King
secretly
hate
the
Great
Charter
which
have

do
his
utmost
to
confirm
him
in
that
dislike
,
and
in
the
preference
he
show
to
foreigner
over
the
English

<EOS>
of
this
,
and
of
his
even
publicly
declare
that
the
Barons
of
England
be
inferior
to
those
of
France
,
the
English
Lords
complain
with
such
bitterness
,
that
the
King

find
them
well
support
by
the

,
become
frightened
for
his

send
away
the
Bishop

all
his
foreign

<EOS>
on
his
marriage
,
however
,
with
ELEANOR
,
a
french
lady
,
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Provence
,
he
openly
favour
the
foreigner
again

and
so
many
of
his
wife
's
relation
come
over
,
and
make
such
an
immense
family
-
party
at
court
,
and
get
so
many
good
thing
,
and
pocket
so
much
money
,
and
be
so
high
with
the
English
whose
money
they
pocket
,
that
the
bold
English
Barons
murmur
openly
about
a
clause
there
be
in
the
Great
Charter
,
which
provide
for
the
banishment
of
unreasonable
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
but

the
foreigner
only
laugh
disdainfully

,
"
what

<EOS>
King
Philip

also
die
after
a
short
reign
of
three
year

and
have
be
succeed
by
his
son
of
the

---
so
moderate
and
just
a
man
that
he
be
not

<EOS>
ISABELLA
,
King
Henry
's
mother
,
wish
very
much
(
for
a
certain
spite
she
have
)
that
England
should
make
war
against
this
king
;
and
,
as
King
Henry
be
a
mere
puppet
in
anybody
's
hand
who
know
how
to
manage
his
feebleness
,
she
easily
carry
her
point
with
him

<EOS>
but
,
the
Parliament
be
determine
to
give
him
no
money
for
such
a
war
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
to
defy
the
Parliament
,
he
pack
up
thirty
large
cask
of
silver
---
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
he
get
so
much
;
I
dare
say
he
screw
it
out
of
the
miserable
Jews
---
and
put
them
aboard
ship
,
and
go
away
himself
to
carry
war
into
France
:
 
accompany
by
his
mother
and
his
brother
Richard
,
Earl
of
Cornwall
,
who
be
rich
and
clever
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
only
get
well
beat
,
and
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
-
humour
of
the
Parliament
be
not
restore
by
this
.
 
<EOS>
They
reproach
the
king
with
waste
the
public
money
to
make
greedy
foreigner
rich
,
and
be
so
stern
with
him
,
and
so
determined
not
to
let
him
have
more
of
it
to
waste
if
they
could
help
it
,
that
he
be
at
his
wit
's
end
for
some
,
and
try
so
shamelessly
to
get
all
he
could
from
his
subject
,
by
excuse
or
by
force
,
that
the
people
use
to
say
the
King
be
the
sturdy
beggar
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
Cross
,
think
to
get
some
money
by
that
mean
;
but
,
as
it
be
very
well
known
that
he
never
mean
to
go
on
a
crusade
,
he
get
none
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
this
contention
,
the
Londoners
be
particularly
keen
against
the
King
,
and
the
King
hate
them
warmly
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
hating
or
loving
,
however
,
make
no
difference
;
he
continue
in
the
same
condition
for
nine
or
ten
year
,
when
at
last
the
Barons
say
that
if
he
would
solemnly
confirm
their
liberty
afresh
,
the
Parliament
would
vote
him
a
large
sum
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
readily
consent
,
there
be
a
great
meeting
hold
in
Westminster
Hall
,
one
pleasant
day
in
May
,
when
all
the
clergy
,
dress
in
their
robe
and
hold
every
one
of
them
a
burn
candle
in
his
hand
,
stand
up
(
the
Barons
be
also
there
)
while
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
read
the
sentence
of
excommunication
against
any
man
,
and
all
man
,
who
should
henceforth
,
in
any
way
,
infringe
the
Great
Charter
of
the
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
,
they
all
put
out
their
burn
candle
with
a
curse
upon
the
soul
of
any
one
,
and
every
one
,
who
should
merit
that
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
conclude
with
an
oath
to
keep
the
Charter
,
"
as
I
be
a
man
,
as
I
be
a
Christian
,
as
I
be
a
Knight
,
as
I
be
a
king
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
make
oath
,
and
easy
to
break
them
;
and
the
King
do
both
,
as
his
father
have
do
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
to
his
old
course
again
when
he
be
supply
with
money
,
and
soon
cure
of
their
weakness
the
few
who
have
ever
really
trust
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
his
money
be
go
,
and
he
be
once
more
borrow
and
beg
everywhere
with
a
meanness
worthy
of
his
nature
,
he
get
into
a
difficulty
with
the
Pope
respect
the
Crown
of
Sicily
,
which
the
Pope
say
he
have
a
right
to
give
away
,
and
which
he
offer
to
King
Henry
for
his
second
son
,
PRINCE
EDMUND
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
or
I
give
away
what
we
have
not
get
,
and
what
belong
to
somebody
else
,
it
be
likely
that
the
person
to
whom
we
give
it
,
will
have
some
trouble
in
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
so
in
this
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
conquer
the
Sicilian
Crown
before
it
could
be
put
upon
young
Edmund
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
conquer
without
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
Pope
order
the
clergy
to
raise
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
clergy
,
however
,
be
not
so
obedient
to
him
as
usual
;
they
have
be
dispute
with
him
for
some
time
about
his
unjust
preference
of
italian
Priests
in
England
;
and
they
have
begin
to
doubt
whether
the
King
's
chaplain
,
whom
he
allow
to
be
pay
for
preach
in
seven
hundred
church
,
could
possibly
be
,
even
by
the
Pope
's
favour
,
in
seven
hundred
place
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Pope
and
the
king
together
,
"
say
the
Bishop
of
London
,
"
may
take
the
mitre
off
my
head
;
but
,
if
they
do
,
they
will
find
that
I
shall
put
on
a
soldier
's
helmet
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Worcester
be
as
bold
as
the
Bishop
of
London
,
and
would
pay
nothing
either
.
 
<EOS>
such
sum
as
the
more
timid
or
more
helpless
of
the
clergy
do
raise
be
squander
away
,
without
do
any
good
to
the
King
,
or
bring
the
Sicilian
Crown
an
inch
near
to
Prince
Edmund
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
the
business
be
,
that
the
Pope
give
the
Crown
to
the
brother
of
the
King
of
France
(
who
conquer
it
for
himself
)
,
and
send
the
King
of
England
in
,
a
bill
of
one
hundred
thousand
pound
for
the
expense
of
not
have
win
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
be
now
so
much
distressed
that
we
may
almost
pity
him
,
if
it
be
possible
to
pity
a
king
so
shabby
and
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
His
clever
brother
,
Richard
,
have
buy
the
title
of
King
of
the
Romans
from
the
german
people
,
and
be
no
longer
near
him
,
to
help
him
with
advice
.
 
<EOS>
the
clergy
,
resist
the
very
Pope
,
be
in
alliance
with
the
Barons
.
 
<EOS>
the
Barons
be
head
by
SIMON
DE
MONTFORT
,
Earl
of
Leicester
,
marry
to
King
Henry
's
sister
,
and
,
though
a
foreigner
himself
,
the
most
popular
man
in
England
against
the
foreign
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
King
next
meet
his
Parliament
,
the
Barons
,
lead
by
this
Earl
,
come
before
him
,
arm
from
head
to
foot
,
and
case
in
armour
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Parliament
again
assemble
,
in
a
month
's
time
,
at
Oxford
,
this
Earl
be
at
their
head
,
and
the
King
be
oblige
to
consent
,
on
oath
,
to
what
be
call
a
Committee
of
Government
:
 
consist
of
twenty
-
four
member
:
 
twelve
choose
by
the
Barons
,
and
twelve
choose
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
at
a
good
time
for
him
,
his
brother
Richard
come
back
.
<EOS>
Richard
's
first
act
(
the
Barons
would
not
admit
him
into
England
on
other
term
)
be
to
swear
to
be
faithful
to
the
Committee
of
Government
---
which
he
immediately
begin
to
oppose
with
all
his
might
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
Barons
begin
to
quarrel
among
themselves
;
especially
the
proud
Earl
of
Gloucester
with
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
who
go
abroad
in
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
people
begin
to
be
dissatisfy
with
the
Barons
,
because
they
do
not
do
enough
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
chance
seem
so
good
again
at
length
,
that
he
take
heart
enough
---
or
catch
it
from
his
brother
---
to
tell
the
Committee
of
Government
that
he
abolish
them
---
as
to
his
oath
,
never
mind
that
,
the
Pope
say
!
<EOS>
---
and
to
seize
all
the
money
in
the
Mint
,
and
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
be
join
by
his
eld
son
,
Prince
Edward
;
and
,
from
the
Tower
,
he
make
public
a
letter
of
the
Pope
's
to
the
world
in
general
,
inform
all
man
that
he
have
be
an
excellent
and
just
King
for
five
-
and
-
forty
year
.
  
<EOS>
as
everybody
know
he
have
be
nothing
of
the
sort
,
nobody
care
much
for
this
document
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
chance
that
the
proud
Earl
of
Gloucester
die
,
be
succeed
by
his
son
;
and
that
his
son
,
instead
of
be
the
enemy
of
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
be
(
for
the
time
)
<EOS>
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
fall
out
,
therefore
,
that
these
two
earl
join
their
force
,
take
several
of
the
Royal
Castles
in
the
country
,
and
advance
as
hard
as
they
could
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
London
people
,
always
opposed
to
the
King
,
declare
for
them
with
great
joy
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
himself
remain
shut
up
,
not
at
all
gloriously
,
in
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Edward
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
,
the
Queen
,
attempt
to
follow
him
by
water
;
but
,
the
people
see
her
barge
row
up
the
river
,
and
hate
her
with
all
their
heart
,
run
to
London
Bridge
,
get
together
a
quantity
of
stone
and
mud
,
and
pelt
the
barge
as
it
come
through
,
cry
furiously
,
"
drown
the
Witch
!
 
<EOS>
drown
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
be
so
near
do
it
,
that
the
Mayor
take
the
old
lady
under
his
protection
,
and
shut
her
up
in
St
Paul
's
until
the
danger
be
past
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
require
a
great
deal
of
write
on
my
part
,
and
a
great
deal
of
read
on
yours
,
to
follow
the
King
through
his
dispute
with
the
Barons
,
and
to
follow
the
baron
through
their
dispute
with
one
another
---
<EOS>
so
I
will
make
short
work
of
it
for
both
of
us
,
and
only
relate
the
chief
event
that
arise
out
of
these
quarrel
.
<EOS>
the
good
King
of
France
be
ask
to
decide
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
King
must
maintain
the
Great
Charter
,
and
that
the
Barons
must
give
up
the
Committee
of
Government
,
and
all
the
rest
that
have
be
do
by
the
Parliament
at
Oxford
:
 
which
the
Royalists
,
or
King
's
party
,
scornfully
call
the
Mad
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
the
Barons
declare
that
these
be
not
fair
term
,
and
they
would
not
accept
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
cause
the
great
bell
of
St
Paul
's
to
be
toll
,
for
the
purpose
of
rouse
up
the
London
people
,
who
arm
themselves
at
the
dismal
sound
and
form
quite
an
army
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
however
,
that
instead
of
fall
upon
the
King
's
party
with
whom
their
quarrel
be
,
they
fall
upon
the
miserable
Jews
,
and
kill
at
least
five
hundred
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
pretend
that
some
of
these
Jews
be
on
the
King
's
side
,
and
that
they
keep
hide
in
their
house
,
for
the
destruction
of
the
people
,
a
certain
terrible
composition
call
Greek
Fire
,
which
could
not
be
put
out
with
water
,
but
only
burn
the
fiercer
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
they
really
do
keep
in
their
house
be
money
;
and
this
their
cruel
enemy
want
,
and
this
their
cruel
enemy
take
,
like
robber
and
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Leicester
put
himself
at
the
head
of
these
Londoners
and
other
force
,
and
follow
the
King
to
Lewes
in
Sussex
,
where
he
lie
encamp
with
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
before
give
the
King
's
force
battle
here
,
the
Earl
address
his
soldier
,
and
say
that
King
Henry
the
Third
have
break
so
many
oath
,
that
he
have
become
the
enemy
of
God
,
and
therefore
they
would
wear
white
crosse
on
their
breast
,
as
if
they
be
array
,
not
against
a
fellow
-
Christian
,
but
against
a
Turk
.
 
<EOS>
White
-
crossed
accordingly
,
they
rush
into
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
have
lose
the
day
---
the
King
have
on
his
side
all
the
foreigner
in
England
:
 
and
,
from
Scotland
,
JOHN
COMYN
,
JOHN
BALIOL
,
and
ROBERT
BRUCE
,
with
all
their
man
---
but
for
the
impatience
of
PRINCE
EDWARD
,
who
,
in
his
hot
desire
to
have
vengeance
on
the
people
of
London
,
throw
the
whole
of
his
father
's
army
into
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
Prisoner
;
so
be
the
king
;
so
be
the
King
's
brother
the
King
of
the
Romans
;
and
five
thousand
englishman
be
leave
dead
upon
the

<EOS>
for
this
success
,
the
Pope
excommunicate
the
Earl
of
Leicester
:
which
neither
the
Earl
nor
the
people
care
at
all
about
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
love
him
and
support
him
,
and
he
become
the
real
king
;
have
all
the
power
of
the
government
in
his
own
hand
,
though
he
be
outwardly
respectful
to
King
Henry
the
Third
,
whom
he
take
with
him
wherever
he
go
,
like
a
poor
old

<EOS>
He
summon
a
Parliament
(
in
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred

sixty
-
five
)
which
be
the
first
Parliament
in
England
that
the

have
any
real
share

and
he
grow
more
and
more
in
favour
with
the
people
every
day
,
and
they
stand
by
him
in
whatever
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
many
of
the
other
Barons
,
and
particularly
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
who
have
become
by
this
time
as
proud
as
his
father
,
grow
jealous
of
this
powerful
and
popular
Earl
,
who
be
proud
too
,
and
begin
to
conspire
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
since
the

have
be

have
never

allow
to
go
out
without
attendant
appoint
by
the
Earl
of
Leicester

who
watch
him

<EOS>
the
conspire
Lords
find
mean
to
propose
to
him
,
in
secret
,
that
they
should
assist
him
to
escape
,
and
should
make
him
their
leader
;
to
which
he
very
heartily
consent
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
on
a
day
that
be
agree
upon
,
he
say
to
his
attendant
after
dinner
(
be
then
at
Hereford
)
,
"
I
should
like
to
ride
on
horseback
,
this
fine
afternoon
,
a
little
way
into
the
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
they
,
too
,
think
it
would
be
very
pleasant
to
have
a
canter
in
the
sunshine
,
they
all
ride
out
of
the
town
together
in
a
gay
little
troop
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
a
fine
level
piece
of
turf
,
the
Prince
fall
to
compare
their
horse
one
with
another
,
and
offer
bet
that
one
be
fast
than
another
;
and
the
attendant
,
suspect
no
harm
,
ride
gallop
match
until
their
horse
be
quite
tired
.
 
<EOS>
the
Prince
ride
no
match
himself
,
but
look
on
from
his
saddle
,
and
stake
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
pass
the
whole
merry
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
sun
be
set
,
and
they
be
all
go
slowly
up
a
hill
,
the
Prince
's
horse
very
fresh
and
<EOS>
all
the
other
horse
very
weary
,
when
a
strange
rider
mount
on
a
grey
steed
appear
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
wave
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
the
fellow
mean
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
attendant
one
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
Prince
answer
on
the
instant
by
set
spur
to
his
horse
,
dash
away
at
his
utmost
speed
,
join
the
man
,
ride
into
the
midst
of
a
little
crowd
of
horseman
who
be
then
see
wait
under
some
tree
,
and
who
close
around
him
;
and
so
he
depart
in
a
cloud
of
dust
,
leave
the
road
empty
of
all
but
the
baffle
attendant
,
who
sit
look
at
one
another
,
while
their
horse
droop
their
ear
and
pant
.
  
<EOS>
the
Prince
join
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
at
Ludlow
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
with
a
part
of
the
army
and
the
stupid
old
King
,
be
at
Hereford
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
Earl
of
Leicester
's
son
,
Simon
de
Montfort
,
with
another
part
of
the
army
,
be
in
Sussex
.
 
<EOS>
to
prevent
these
two
part
from
unite
be
the
Prince
's
first
object
.
 
<EOS>
He
attack
Simon
de
Montfort
by
night
,
defeat
him
,
seize
his
banner
and
treasure
,
and
force
him
into
Kenilworth
Castle
in
Warwickshire
,
which
belong
to
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
His
father
,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
not
know
what
have
happen
,
march
out
of
Hereford
,
with
his
part
of
the
army
and
the
King
,
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
,
on
a
bright
morning
in
August
,
to
Evesham
,
which
be
water
by
the
pleasant
river
Avon
.
<EOS>
look
rather
anxiously
across
the
prospect
towards
Kenilworth
,
he
see
his
own
banner
advance
;
and
his
face
brighten
with
joy
.
<EOS>
but
,
it
cloud
darkly
when
he
presently
perceive
that
the
banner
be
capture
,
and
in
the
enemy
's
hand
;
and
he
say
,
"
It
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
have
mercy
on
our
soul
,
for
our
body
be
Prince
Edward
's
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
fight
like
a
true
Knight
,
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
when
his
horse
be
kill
under
him
,
he
fight
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fierce
battle
,
and
the
dead
lie
in
heap
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
King
,
stick
up
in
a
suit
of
armour
on
a
big
war
-
horse
,
which
do
not
mind
him
at
all
,
and
which
carry
him
into
all
sort
of
place
where
he
do
not
want
to
go
,
get
into
everybody
's
way
,
and
very
nearly
get
knock
on
the
head
by
one
of
his
son
's
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
manage
to
pipe
out
,
"
I
be
Harry
of
Winchester
!
"
and
the
Prince
,
who
hear
him
,
seize
his
bridle
,
and
take
him
out
of
peril
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Leicester
still
fight
bravely
,
until
his
good
son
Henry
be
kill
,
and
the
body
of
his
good
friend
choke
his
path
;
and
then
he
fall
,
still
fight
,
sword
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
mangle
his
body
,
and
send
it
as
a
present
to
a
noble
lady
---
but
a
very
unpleasant
lady
,
I
should
think
---
<EOS>
who
be
the
wife
of
his
bad
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
mangle
his
memory
in
the
mind
of
the
faithful
people
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
many
year
afterwards
,
they
love
him
more
than
ever
,
and
regard
him
as
a
Saint
,
and
always
speak
of
him
as
"
Sir
Simon
the
Righteous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
even
though
he
be
dead
,
the
cause
for
which
he
have
fight
still
live
,
and
be
strong
,
and
force
itself
upon
the
King
in
the
very
hour
of
victory
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
find
himself
oblige
to
respect
the
Great
Charter
,
however
much
he
hate
it
,
and
to
make
law
similar
to
the
law
of
the
Great
Earl
of
Leicester
,
and
to
be
moderate
and
forgiving
towards
the
people
at
last
---
even
towards
the
people
of
London
,
who
have
so
long
oppose
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
more
rising
before
all
this
be
do
,
but
they
be
set
at
rest
by
these
mean
,
and
Prince
Edward
do
his
good
in
all
thing
to
restore
peace
.
 
<EOS>
one
Sir
Adam
de
Gourdon
be
the
last
dissatisfied
knight
in
arm
;
but
,
the
Prince
vanquish
him
in
single
combat
,
in
a
wood
,
and
nobly
give
him
his
life
,
and
become
his
friend
,
instead
of
slay
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Adam
be
not
ungrateful
.
 
<EOS>
He
ever
afterwards
remain
devoted
to
his
generous
conqueror
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
trouble
of
the
Kingdom
be
thus
calm
,
Prince
Edward
and
his
cousin
Henry
take
the
Cross
,
and
go
away
to
the
Holy
Land
,
with
many
English
Lords
and
Knights
.
 
<EOS>
four
year
afterwards
the
King
of
the
Romans
die
,
and
,
next
year
(
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
)
,
his
brother
the
weak
King
of
England
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sixty
-
eight
year
old
then
,
and
have
reign
fifty
-
six
year
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
much
of
a
king
in
death
,
as
he
have
ever
be
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
mere
pale
shadow
of
a
King
at
all
time

<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
First
,
call
Longshanks
    
it
be
now
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
;
and
Prince
Edward
,
the
heir
to
the
throne
,
be
away
in
the
Holy
Land
,
know
nothing
of
his
father
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
Barons
,
however
,
proclaim
him
King
,
immediately
after
the
Royal
funeral
;
and
the
people
very
willingly
consent
,
since
most
man
know
too
well
by
this
time
what
the
horror
of
a
contest
for
the
crown
be
.
<EOS>
so
King
Edward
the
First
,
call
,
in
a
not
very
complimentary
manner
,
LONGSHANKS
,
because
of
the
slenderness
of
his
leg
,
be
peacefully
accept
by
the
English
Nation
.
  
<EOS>
His
leg
have
nee
to
be
strong
,
however
long
and
thin
they
be
;
for
they
have
to
support
him
through
many
difficulty
on
the
fiery
sand
of
Asia
,
where
his
small
force
of
soldier
faint
,
die
,
desert
,
and
seem
to
melt
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
prowess
make
light
of
it
,
and
he
say
,
"
I
will
go
on
,
if
I
go
on
with
no
other
follower
than
my
groom
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
Prince
of
this
spirit
give
the
Turks
a
deal
of
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
He
storm
Nazareth
,
at
which
place
,
of
all
place
on
earth
,
I
be
sorry
to
relate
,
he
make
a
frightful
slaughter
of
innocent
people
;
and
then
he
go
to
Acre
,
where
he
get
a
truce
of
ten
year
from
the
Sultan
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
very
nearly
lose
his
life
in
Acre
,
through
the
treachery
of
a
Saracen
Noble
,
call
the
Emir
of
Jaffa
,
who
,
make
the
pretence
that
he
have
some
idea
of
turn
Christian
and
want
to
know
all
about
that
religion
,
send
a
trusty
messenger
to
Edward
very
often
---
with
a
dagger
in
his
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
Friday
in
Whitsun
week
,
when
it
be
very
hot
,
and
all
the
sandy
prospect
lie
beneath
the
blaze
sun
,
burn
up
like
a
great
overdone
biscuit
,
and
Edward
be
lie
on
a
couch
,
dress
for
coolness
in
only
a
loose
robe
,
the
messenger
,
with
his
chocolate
-
colour
face
and
his
bright
dark
eye
and
white
tooth
,
come
creep
in
with
a
letter
,
and
kneel
down
like
a
tame
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
moment
Edward
stretch
out
his
hand
to
take
the
letter
,
the
tiger
make
a
spring
at
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quick
,
but
Edward
be
quick
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
seize
the
traitor
by
his
chocolate
throat
,
throw
him
to
the
ground
,
and
slay
him
with
the
very
dagger
he
have
draw
.
 
<EOS>
the
weapon
have
strike
Edward
in
the
arm
,
and
although
the
wound
itself
be
slight
,
it
threaten
to
be
mortal
,
for
the
blade
of
the
dagger
have
be
smear
with
poison
.
 
<EOS>
thank
,
however
,
to
a
well
surgeon
than
be
often
to
be
find
in
those
time
,
and
to
some
wholesome
herb
,
and
above
all
,
to
his
faithful
wife
,
ELEANOR
,
who
devotedly
nurse
him
,
and
be
say
by
some
to
have
suck
the
poison
from
the
wound
with
her
own
red
lip
(
which
I
be
very
willing
to
believe
)
,
Edward
soon
recover
and
be
sound
again
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
King
his
father
have
send
entreaty
to
him
to
return
home
,
he
now
begin
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
get
as
far
as
Italy
,
when
he
meet
messenger
who
bring
him
intelligence
of
the
King
's
death
.
<EOS>
hear
that
all
be
quiet
at
home
,
he
make
no
haste
to
return
to
his
own
dominion
,
but
pay
a
visit
to
the
Pope
,
and
go
in
state
through
various
italian
town
,
where
he
be
welcome
with
acclamation
as
a
mighty
champion
of
the
Cross
from
the
Holy
Land
,
and
where
he
receive
present
of
purple
mantle
and
prance
horse
,
and
go
along
in
great
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
the
shout
people
little
know
that
he
be
the
last
english
monarch
who
would
ever
embark
in
a
crusade
,
or
that
within
twenty
year
every
conquest
which
the
Christians
have
make
in
the
Holy
Land
at
the
cost
of
so
much
blood
,
would
be
win
back
by
the
Turks
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
this
come
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
and
there
be
,
an
old
town
stand
in
a
plain
in
France
,
call
ChÉlons
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
king
be
come
towards
this
place
on
his
way
to
England
,
a
wily
french
Lord
,
call
the
Count
of
ChÉlons
,
send
him
a
polite
challenge
to
come
with
his
knight
and
hold
a
fair
tournament
with
the
Count
and
his
knight
,
and
make
a
day
of
it
with
sword
and
lance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
represent
to
the
King
that
the
Count
of
ChÉlons
be
not
to
be
trust
,
and
that
,
instead
of
a
holiday
fight
for
mere
show
and
in
good
humour
,
he
secretly
mean
a
real
battle
,
in
which
the
English
should
be
defeat
by
superior
force
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
,
however
,
nothing
afraid
,
go
to
the
appoint
place
on
the
appoint
day
with
a
thousand
follower
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Count
come
with
two
thousand
and
attack
the
English
in
earnest
,
the
English
rush
at
them
with
such
valour
that
the
Count
's
man
and
the
Count
's
horse
soon
begin
to
be
tumble
down
all
over
the
field
.
<EOS>
the
Count
himself
seize
the
King
round
the
neck
,
but
the
king
tumble
him
out
of
his
saddle
in
return
for
the
compliment
,
and
,
jump
from
his
own
horse
,
and
stand
over
him
,
beat
away
at
his
iron
armour
like
a
blacksmith
hammer
on
his
anvil
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
the
Count
own
himself
defeat
and
offer
his
sword
,
the
King
would
not
do
him
the
honour
to
take
it
,
but
make
him
yield
it
up
to
a
common
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
such
fury
show
in
this
fight
,
that
it
be
afterwards
call
the
little
Battle
of
ChÉlons
.
  
<EOS>
the
English
be
very
well
disposed
to
be
proud
of
their
king
after
these
adventure
;
so
,
when
he

at
Dover
in

splendid

a

He

the

to

England

Scotland

<EOS>
to
make
these
quarrel
clear

we

separate
their

take
them
thus
.

Wales

<EOS>
LLEWELLYN
be
the
Prince

<EOS>
He
have
be
on
the
side
of
the
Barons
in
the
reign
of
the
stupid
old
King
,
but
have
afterwards
swear
allegiance
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
King
Edward
come
to
the
throne
,
Llewellyn
be
require
to
swear
allegiance
to
him
also
;
which
he
refuse
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
be
crown
and
in
his
own
dominion
,
three
time
more
require
Llewellyn
to
come
and
do
homage
;
and
three
time
more
Llewellyn
say
he
would
rather
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
be
married
to
ELEANOR
DE
MONTFORT
,
a
young
lady
of
the
family
mention
in
the
last
reign

and
it
chance
that
this
young

,
come
from
France
with
her
young
brother
,
emeric
,
be
take
by
an
english
ship
,
and
be
order
by
the
English
King
to
be
detain
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
quarrel
come
to
a
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
go
,
with
his
fleet
,
to
the
coast
of
Wales
,
where
,
so
encompass
Llewellyn
,
that
he
could
only
take
refuge
in
the
bleak
mountain
region
of
Snowdon
in
which
no
provision
could
reach
him
,
he
be
soon
starve
into
an
apology
,
and
into
a
treaty
of
peace
,
and
into
pay
the
expense
of
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
however
,
forgave
him
some
of
the
hard
condition
of
the
treaty
,
and
consent
to
his
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
now
think
he
have
reduce
Wales
to
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Welsh
,
although
they
be
naturally
a
gentle
,
quiet
,
pleasant
people
,
who
like
to
receive
stranger
in
their
cottage
among
the
mountain
,
and
to
set
before
them
with
free
hospitality
whatever
they
have
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
to
play
to
them
on
their
harp
,
and
sing
their
native
ballad
to
them
,
be
a
people
of
great
spirit
when
their
blood
be
up
.
 
<EOS>
Englishmen
,
after
this
affair
,
begin
to
be
insolent
in
Wales
,
and
to
assume
the
air
of
master
;
and
the
Welsh
pride
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
they
believe
in
that
unlucky
old
Merlin
,
some
of
whose
unlucky
old
prophecy
somebody
always
seem
doom
to
remember
when
there
be
a
chance
of
its
do
harm
;
and
just
at
this
time
some
blind
old
gentleman
with
a
harp
and
a
long
white
beard
,
who
be
an
excellent
person
,
but
have
become
of
an
unknown
age
and
tedious
,
burst
out
with
a
declaration
that
Merlin
have
predict
that
when
english
money
have
become
round
,
a
Prince
of
Wales
would
be
crown
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
King
Edward
have
recently
forbid
the
english
penny
to
be
cut
into
half
and
quarter
for
halfpence
and
farthing
,
and
have
actually
introduce
a
round
coin
;
therefore
,
the
Welsh
people
say
this
be
the
time
Merlin
mean
,
and
rise
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
have
buy
over
PRINCE
DAVID
,
Llewellyn
's
brother
,
by
heap
favour
upon
him
;
but
he
be
the
first
to
revolt
,
be
perhaps
trouble
in
his
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
one
stormy
night
,
he
surprise
the
Castle
of
Hawarden
,
in
possession
of
which
an
English
nobleman
have
be
leave
;
kill
the
whole
garrison
,
and
carry
off
the
nobleman
a
prisoner
to
Snowdon
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
Welsh
people
rise
like
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
with
his
army
,
march
from
Worcester
to
the
Menai
Strait
,
cross
it
---
near
to
where
the
wonderful
tubular
iron
bridge
now
,
in
day
so
different
,
make
a
passage
for
railway
train
---
by
a
bridge
of
boat
that
enable
forty
man
to
march
abreast
.
 
<EOS>
He
subdue
the
Island
of
Anglesea
,
and
send
his
man
forward
to
observe
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
Welsh
create
a
panic
among
them
,
and
they
fall
back
to
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
the
tide
have
in
the
meantime
rise
and
separate
the
boat
;
the
Welsh
pursue
them
,
they
be
drive
into
the
sea
,
and
there
they
sink
,
in
their
heavy
iron
armour
,
by
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
victory
Llewellyn
,
help
by
the
severe
winter
-
weather
of
Wales
,
gain
another
battle
;
but
the
King
order
a
portion
of
his
english
army
to
advance
through
South
Wales
,
and
catch
him
between
two
foe
,
and
Llewellyn
bravely
turn
to
meet
this
new
enemy
,
he
be
surprised
and
kill
---
very
meanly
,
for
he
be
unarmed
and
defenceless
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
be
strike
off
and
send
to
London
,
where
it
be
fix
upon
the
Tower
,
encircle
with
a
wreath
,
some
say
of
ivy
,
some
say
of
willow
,
some
say
of
silver
,
to
make
it
look
like
a
ghastly
coin
in
ridicule
of
the
prediction
.
  
<EOS>
David
,
however
,
still
hold
out
for
six
month
,
though
eagerly
seek
after
by
the
King
,
and
hunt
by
his
own
countryman
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
finally
betray
him
with
his
wife
and
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sentence
to
be
hang
,
draw
,
and
quarter
;
and
from
that
time
this
become
the
establish
punishment
of
traitor
in
England
---
a
punishment
wholly
without
excuse
,
as
be
revolt
,
vile
,
and
cruel
,
after
its
object
be
dead
;
and
which
have
no
sense
in
it
,
as
its
only
real
degradation
(
and
that
nothing
can
blot
out
)
be
to
the
country
that
permit
on
any
consideration
such
abominable
barbarity
.
  
<EOS>
Wales
be
now
subdue
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
give
birth
to
a
young
prince
in
the
Castle
of
Carnarvon
,
the
King
show
him
to
the
Welsh
people
as
their
countryman
,
and
call
him
Prince
of
Wales
;
a
title
that
have
ever
since
be
bear
by
the
heir
-
apparent
to
the
english
throne
---
which
that
little
Prince
soon
become
,
by
the
death
of
his
eld
brother
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
do
well
thing
for
the
Welsh
than
that
,
by
improve
their
law
and
encourage
their
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Disturbances
still
take
place
,
chiefly
occasion
by
the
avarice
and
pride
of
the
English
Lords
,
on
whom
Welsh
land
and
castle
have
be
bestow
;
but
they
be
subdue
,
and
the
country
never
rise
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
legend
that
to
prevent
the
people
from
be
incite
to
rebellion
by
the
song
of
their
bard
and
harper
,
Edward
have
them
all
put
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
may
have
fall
among
other
man
who
hold
out
against
the
king
;
but
this
general
slaughter
be
,
I
think
,
a
fancy
of
the
harper
themselves
,
who
,
I
dare
say
,
make
a
song
about
it
<EOS>
many
year
afterwards
,
and
sing
it
by
the
Welsh
fireside
until
it
come
to
be
believe
.
  
<EOS>
the
foreign
war
of
the
reign
of
Edward
the
First
arise
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
the
crew
of
two
vessel
,
one
a
Norman
ship
,
and
the
other
an
english
ship
,
happen
to
go
to
the
same
place
in
their
boat
to
fill
their
cask
with
fresh
water
.
 
<EOS>
be
rough
angry
fellow
,
they
begin
to
quarrel
,
and
then
to
fight
---
the
English
with
their
fist
;
the
Normans
with
their
knife
---
and
,
in
the
fight
,
a
Norman
be
kill
.
 
<EOS>
the
Norman
crew
,
instead
of
revenge
themselves
upon
those
english
sailor
with
whom
they
have
quarrel
(
who
be
too
strong
for
them
,
I
suspect
)
,
take
to
their
ship
again
in
a
great
rage
,
attack
the
first
english
ship
they
meet
,
lay
hold
of
an
unoffending
merchant
who
happen
to
be
on
board
,
and
brutally
hang
him
in
the
rigging
of
their
own
vessel
with
a
dog
at
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
this
so
enrage
the
english
sailor
that
there
be
no
restrain
them
;
and
whenever
,
and
wherever
,
English
sailor
meet
Norman
sailor
,
they
fall
upon
each
other
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
the
irish
and
dutch
sailor
take
part
with
the
English
;
the
french
and
genoese
sailor
help
the
Normans
;
and
thus
the
great
part
of
the
mariner
sail
over
the
sea
become
,
in
their
way
,
as
violent
and
rage
as
the
sea
itself
when
it
be
disturb
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
's
fame
have
be
so
high
abroad
that
he
have
be
choose
to
decide
a
difference
between
France
and
another
foreign
power
,
and
have
live
upon
the
continent
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
neither
he
nor
the
french
King
PHILIP
(
the
good
Louis
have
be
dead
some
time
)
interfere
in
these
quarrel
;
but
when
a
fleet
of
eighty
english
ship
engage
and
utterly
defeat
a
Norman
fleet
of
two
hundred
,
in
a
pitch
battle
fight
round
a
ship
at
anchor
,
in
which
no
quarter
be
give
,
the
matter
become
too
serious
to
be
pass
over
.
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
as
Duke
of
Guienne
,
be
summon
to
present
himself
before
the
King
of
France
,
at
Paris
,
and
answer
for
the
damage
do
by
his
sailor
subject
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
send
the
Bishop
of
London
as
his
representative
,
and
then
his
brother
EDMUND
,
who
be
marry
to
the
French
Queen
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
Edmund
be
an
easy
man
,
and
allow
himself
to
be
talk
over
by
his
charming
relation
,
the
french
court
lady
;
at
all
event
,
he
be
induce
to
give
up
his
brother
's
dukedom
for
forty
day
---
as
a
mere
form
,
the
french
King
say
,
to
satisfy
his
honour
---
<EOS>
and
he
be
so
very
much
astonished
,
when
the
time
be
out
,
to
find
that
the
french
King
have
no
idea
of
give
it
up
again
,
that
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
hasten
his
death
:
 
<EOS>
which
soon
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
be
a
king
to
win
his
foreign
dukedom
back
again
,
if
it
could
be
win
by
energy
and
valour
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
a
large
army
,
renounce
his
allegiance
as
Duke
of
Guienne
,
and
cross
the
sea
to
carry
war
into
France
.
 
<EOS>
before
any
important
battle
be
fight
,
however
,
a
truce
be
agree
upon
for
two
year
;
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
,
the
Pope
effect
a
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
who
be
now
a
widower
,
have
lose
his
affectionate
and
good
wife
,
Eleanor
,
marry
the
french
King

sister

MARGARET
;
and
the
Prince
of
Wales
be
contract
to
the
french
King
's
daughter
ISABELLA

<EOS>
out
of
bad
thing
,
good
thing
sometimes
arise
.
 
<EOS>
out
of
this
hanging
of
the
innocent
merchant
,
and
the
bloodshed
and
strife
it
cause
,
there
come
to
be
establish
one
of
the
great
power
that
the
english
people
now
possess
.
 
<EOS>
the
preparation
for
the
war
be
very
expensive
,
and
King
Edward
greatly
want
money
,
and
be
very
arbitrary
in
his
way
of
raise
it
,
some
of
the
Barons
begin
firmly
to
oppose
him
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
them
,
in
particular
,
HUMPHREY
BOHUN
,
Earl
of
Hereford
,
and
ROGER
BIGOD

Earl
of
Norfolk

be
so
stout
against
him

that
they
maintain
he
have
no
right

the

contrary
;
and
when
they
refuse
to
pay

reduce
them
to
submission
,
by
say
<EOS>
very
well
,
then
they
have
no
claim
upon

and
any
man
may
plunder
them
who
would

which
a
good
many

very

He

so
unpopular
among

lead
by
those
two
great
Earls
,
declare
any
taxis

without
the
consent
of
Parliament

unlawful
;
and
the
Parliament
refuse
to
impose
taxis
,
until
the
King
should
confirm
afresh
the
two
Great
Charters
,
and
should
solemnly
declare
in
writing
,
that
there
be
no
power
in
the
country
to
raise
money
from
the

<EOS>
the

be
very
unwilling
to
diminish
his

there

<EOS>
We
shall
come

from
the
good

wisdom
of
this
King

much
improved
;
provision

for
the

which
be
the
great
and
lasting
trouble
of
the
reign
of
King

First
.
  
<EOS>
about
thirteen
year
after

in
Scotland
,
where
as
many
as
thirteen
noisy
claimant
to
the
vacant
throne
start
up
and
make
a
general
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
be
much
renowned
for
his
sagacity
and
justice
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
have
be
agree
to
refer
the
dispute
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
accept
the
trust
,
and
go
,
with
an
army
,
to
the
border
-
land
where
England
and
Scotland
join
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
call
upon
the
scottish
gentleman
to
meet
him
at
the
Castle
of
Norham
,
on
the
english
side
of
the
river
Tweed
;
and
to
that
Castle
they
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
before
he
would
take
any
step
in
the
business
,
he
require
those
scottish
gentleman
,
one
and
all
,
to
do
homage
to
him
as
their
superior
Lord
;
and
when
they
hesitate
,
he
say
,
"

holy
Edward
,
whose
crown
I
wear
,
I
will
have
my
right

"
<EOS>
the
scottish
gentleman
,
who
have
not
expect
this
,
be
disconcert
,
and
ask
for
three
week
to
think
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
three
week
,
another
meeting
take
place
,
on
a
green
plain
on
the
scottish
side
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
the
competitor
for
the
scottish
throne
,
there
be
only
two
who
have
any
real
claim
,
in
right
of
their

the
Royal
Family

<EOS>
these
be
JOHN
BALIOL
and
ROBERT
BRUCE
:
 
and
the
right
be
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
on
the
side
of
John
Baliol

<EOS>

<EOS>
next

and

<EOS>
this
point

,
some
arrangement

for
inquire
into
their
title

<EOS>
the
inquiry
occupy
a
pretty
long
time
---
more
than
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
while
it
be
go
on
,
King
Edward
take
the
opportunity
of
make
a
journey
through
Scotland
,
and
call
upon
the
scottish
people
of
all
degree
to
acknowledge
themselves
his
vassal
,
or
be
imprison
until
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
commissioner
be
appoint
to
conduct
the
inquiry
,
a
Parliament
be
hold
at
Berwick
about
it
,
the
two
claimant
be
hear
at
full
length
,
and
there
be
a
vast
amount
of
talking
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
in
the
great
hall
of
the
Castle
of
Berwick
,
the
King
give
judgment
in
favour
of
John
Baliol
:
 
who
,
consent
to
receive
his
crown
by
the
King
of
England
's
favour
and
permission
,
be
crown
at
Scone
,
in
an
old
stone
chair
which
have
be
use
for
age
in
the
abbey
there
,
at
the
coronation
of
Scottish
king
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
King
Edward
cause
the
great
seal
of
Scotland
,
use
since
the
late
King
's
death
,
to
be
break
in
four
piece
,
and
place
in
the
English
Treasury
;
and
consider
that
he
now
have
Scotland
(
accord
to
the
common
saying
)
under
his
thumb
.
  
<EOS>
Scotland
have
a
strong
will
of
its
own
yet
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
determine
that
the
scottish
King
should
not
forget
he
be
his
vassal
,
summon
him
repeatedly
to
come
and
defend
himself
and
his
judge
before
the
English
Parliament
when
appeal
from
the
decision
of
scottish
court
of
justice
be
be
hear
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
John
Baliol
,
who
have
no
great
heart
of
his
own
,
have
so
much
heart
put
into
him
by
the
brave
spirit
of
the
scottish
people
,
who
take
this
as
a
national
insult
,
that
he
refuse
to
come
any
more
.
<EOS>
thereupon
,
the
King
further
require
him
to
help
him
in
his
war
abroad
(
which
be
then
in
progress
)
,
and
to
give
up
,
as
security
for
his
good
behaviour
in
future
,
the
three
strong
Scottish
Castles
of
Jedburgh
,
Roxburgh
,
and
Berwick
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
of
this
be
do
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
scottish
people
conceal
their
king
among
their
mountain
in
the
Highlands
and
show
a
determination
to
resist
;
Edward
march
to
Berwick
with
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
foot
,
and
four
thousand
horse
;
take
the
Castle
,
and
slay
its
whole
garrison
,
and
the
inhabitant
of
the
town
as
well
---
man
,
woman
,
and
child
.
<EOS>
LORD
WARRENNE
,
Earl
of
Surrey
,
then
go
on
to
the
Castle
of
Dunbar
,
before
which
a
battle
be
fight
,
and
the
whole
scottish
army
defeat
with
great
slaughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
victory
be
complete
,
the
Earl
of
Surrey
be
leave
as
guardian
of
Scotland
;
the
principal
office
in
that
kingdom
be
give
to
Englishmen
;
the
more
powerful
Scottish
Nobles
be
oblige
to
come
and
live
in
England
;
the
scottish
crown
and
sceptre
be
bring
away
;
and
even
the
old
stone
chair
be
carry
off
and
place
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
where
you
may
see
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Baliol
have
the
Tower
of
London
lend
him
for
a
residence
,
with
permission
to
range
about
within
a
circle
of
twenty
mile
.
 
<EOS>
three
year
afterwards
he
be
allow
to
go
to
Normandy
,
where
he
have
estate
,
and
where
he
pass
the
remain
six
year
of
his
life
:
 
far
more
happily
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
than
he
have
live
for
a
long
while
in
angry
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
,
in
the
West
of
Scotland
,
a
gentleman
of
small
fortune
,
name
WILLIAM
WALLACE
,
the
second
son
of
a
scottish
knight
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
great
size
and
great
strength
;
he
be
very
brave
and
daring
;
when
he
speak
to
a
body
of
his
countryman
,
he
could
rouse
them
in
a
wonderful
manner
by
the
power
of
his
burn
word
;
he
love
Scotland
dearly
,
and
he
hate
England
with
his
utmost
might
.
 
<EOS>
the
domineering
conduct
of
the
English
who
now
hold
the
place
of
trust
in
Scotland
make
them
as
intolerable
to
the
proud
scottish
people
as
they
have
be
,
under
similar
circumstance
,
to
the
Welsh
;
and
no
man
in
all
Scotland

them
with
so
much
smothered
rage
as
William
Wallace
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
an
Englishman
in

HIM

<EOS>
Wallace

him
dead

and
there
join
with
his
countryman
,
SIR
WILLIAM
DOUGLAS

who
be

become
the
most
resolute
and
undaunted
champion
of
a
people
struggle
for
their
independence
that
ever

.
  
<EOS>
the

before
him
,

the

Forth

<EOS>
across
the
river
there
be
only
one
poor
wooden
bridge
,
call
the
bridge
of
Kildean
---
so
narrow
,
that

but
two

<EOS>
with
his

upon
this

It

bold
Wallace
to
win
the
whole
country
back
again
,
and
even

,
after
a

winter
month
,
the

forward

<EOS>
and

the

<EOS>
these
two
young
man
may
agree
in
oppose
Edward
,
but
could
agree
in
nothing
else
,
as
they
be
rival
for
the
throne
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
probably
it
be
because
they
know
this
,
and
know
what
trouble
must
arise
even
if
they
could
hope
to
get
the
well
of
the
great
English
King
,
that
the
principal
scottish

apply
to
the
Pope
for
his
interference

<EOS>
the
Pope
,
on
the
principle
of
lose
nothing
for
want
of
try
to
get
it
,
very
coolly
claim
that
Scotland
belong
to
him

this
be
a
little
too
much

him
so

then

He

what

<EOS>
what
they

he

He

insolent

audacious
fellow

<EOS>
He
be
detest
by

not
only
because
he
have
such
power
over
the
King
,
and
make
the
Court
such
a
dissipated
place
,
but
,
also
,
because
he
could
ride
better
than
they

be
use

in
his
impudence
,
to
cut
very
bad

this

It

<EOS>
when

have
the
honour

<EOS>
this
make
the
proud
Lords
fiercer

the

despise
the
favourite

would
never
call

however
much
he

for
not

persist

<EOS>
the

the

appoint
Governor

<EOS>
even
this
be
not
enough
for
the
besotted
King

who
bring
him
home
again
in
a
year
's
time
,
and
not
only
disgust
the
Court
and
the
people
by
his
dote
folly
,
but
offend
his
beautiful

too
,
who
never
like
him
afterwards

<EOS>
He
have
now
the

the

have
the

positively
refuse

let
him
raise
any

<EOS>
He
summon
a
Parliament

the

be
near
him

<EOS>
He
summon
another
Parliament
at
Westminster

and
send
Gaveston
away

then

the

completely
armed

every
year
,
and
even
twice
if
necessary
,
instead
of
summon
it
only
when
he
choose
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
that
Gaveston
should
once
more
be
banish
,
and
,
this
time
,
on
pain
of
death
if
he
ever
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
tear
be
of
no
avail
;
he
be
oblige
to
send
his
favourite
to
flander
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
do
so
,
however
,
he
dissolve
the
Parliament
,
with
the
low
cunning
of
a
mere
fool
,
and
set
off
to
the
North
of
England
,
think
to
get
an
army
about
him
to
oppose
the
Nobles
.
 
<EOS>
and
once
again
he
bring
Gaveston
home
,
and
heap
upon
him
all
the
rich
and
title
of
which
the
Barons
have
deprive
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lords
see
,
now
,
that
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
the
favourite
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
have
do
so
,
legally
,
accord
to
the
term
of
his
banishment
;
but
they
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
in
a
shabby
manner
.
 
<EOS>
lead
by
the
Earl
of
Lancaster
,
the
King
's
cousin
,
they
first
of
all
attack
the
King
and
Gaveston
at
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
They
have
time
to
escape
by
sea
,
and
the
mean
King
,
have
his
precious
Gaveston
with
him
,
be
quite
content
to
leave
his
lovely
wife
behind
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
comparatively
safe
,
they
separate
;
the
King
go
to
York
to
collect
a
force
of
soldier
;
and
the
favourite
shut
himself
up
,
in
the
meantime
,
in
Scarborough
Castle
overlook
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
what
the
Barons
want
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
that
the
Castle
could
not
hold
out
;
they
attack
it
,
and
make
Gaveston
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
He
deliver
himself
up
to
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
---
that
Lord
whom
he
have
call
the
Jew
---
on
the
Earl
's
pledge
his
faith
and
knightly
word
,
that
no
harm
should
happen
to
him
and
no
violence
be
do
him
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
agree
with
Gaveston
that
he
should
be
take
to
the
Castle
of
Wallingford
,
and
there
keep
in
honourable
custody
.
 
<EOS>
They
travel
as
far
as
Dedington
,
near
Banbury
,
<EOS>
where
,
in
the
Castle
of
that
place
,
they
stop
for
a
night
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
leave
his
prisoner
there
,
know
what
would
happen
,
or
really
leave
him
think
no
harm
,
and
only
go
(
as
he
pretend
)
to
visit
his
wife
,
the
Countess
,
who
be
in
the
neighbourhood
,
be
no
great
matter
now
;
in
any
case
,
he
be
bind
as
an
honourable
gentleman
to
protect
his
prisoner
,
and
he
do
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
while
the
favourite
be
yet
in
bed
,
he
be
require
to
dress
himself
and
come
down
into
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
without
any
mistrust
,
but
start
and
turn
pale
when
he
find
it
full
of
strange
armed
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
me
?
"
say
their
leader
,
also
arm
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
black
dog
of
Ardenne
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
time
be
come
when
Piers
Gaveston
be
to
feel
the
black
dog
's
tooth
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
They
set
him
on
a
mule
,
and
carry
him
,
in
mock
state
and
with
military
music
,
to
the
black
dog
's
kennel
---
Warwick
Castle
---
where
a
hasty
council
,
compose
of
some
great
nobleman
,
consider
what
should
be
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
for
spare
him
,
but
one
loud
voice
---
it
be
the
black
dog
's
bark
,
I
dare
say
---
sound
through
the
Castle
Hall
,
utter
these
word
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
fox
in
your
power
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
go
now
,
and
you
must
hunt
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
sentence
him
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
Earl
of
Lancaster
---
the
old
hog
---
<EOS>
but
the
old
hog
be
as
savage
as
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
out
upon
the
pleasant
road
,
lead
from
Warwick
to
Coventry
,
where
the
beautiful
river
Avon
,
by
which
,
long
afterwards
,
WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE
be
bear
and
now
lie
bury
,
sparkle
in
the
bright
landscape
of
the
beautiful
May
-
day
;
and
there
they
strike
off
his
wretched
head
,
and
stain
the
dust
with
his
blood
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
King
hear
of
this
black
deed
,
in
his
grief
and
rage
he
denounce
relentless
war
against
his
baron
,
and
both
side
be
in
arm
for
half
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
then
become
necessary
for
them
to
join
their
force
against
Bruce
,
who
have
use
the
time
well
while
they
be
divide
,
and
have
now
a
great
power
in
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
intelligence
be
bring
that
Bruce
be
then
besiege
Stirling
Castle
,
and
that
the
Governor
have
be
oblige
to
pledge
himself
to
surrender
it
,
unless
he
should
be
relieve
before
a
certain
day
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
the
King
order
the
noble
and
their
fighting
-
man
to
meet
him
at
Berwick
;
but
,
the
noble
care
so
little
for
the
king
,
and
so
neglect
the
summon
,
and
lose
time
,
that
only
on
the
day
before
that
appoint
for
the
surrender
,
do
the
King
find
himself
at
Stirling
,
and
even
then
with
a
small
force
than
he
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
,
altogether
,
<EOS>
a
hundred
thousand

on

very
evening
,
when
the

Bruce
do
a
brave
act
that
encourage
his

He

<EOS>
Bruce

thrust
,
and
with
one
blow

<EOS>
the

randolph

valiant
Nephew

small
body

into
such
a
host
of
the
English
,
all
shine
in
polished
armour
in
the
sunlight
,
that
they
seem
to
be
swallow
up
and
lose
,
as
if
they
have
plunge
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
they
fight
so
well
,
and
do
such
dreadful
execution
,
that
the
English
stagger
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
Bruce
himself
upon
them
,
with
all
the
rest
of
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
while
they
be
thus
hard
press
and
amazed
,
there
appear
upon
the
hill
what
they
suppose
to
be
a
new
scottish
army
,
but
what
be
really
only
the
camp
follower
,
in
number
fifteen
thousand
:
 
whom
Bruce
have
teach
to
show
themselves
at
that
place
and
time

<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
command
the
english
horse
,
make
a
last
rush
to
change
the
fortune
of
the
day
;
but
Bruce
(
like
Jack
the
Giant
-
killer
in
the
story
)
have
have
pit
dig
in
the
ground
,
and
cover
over
with

into
these

<EOS>
the
English

completely

;
all
their
treasure

and
engine

be
take
by
the
scottish

the

completely

;
and
never
be
a
battle
win
,
more
famous
upon
scottish
ground
,
than
this
great
battle
of
BANNOCKBURN
.
  
<EOS>
Plague
and
famine
succeed
in
England
;
and
still
the
powerless
King
and
his
disdainful
Lords
be
always
in
contention
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
turbulent
chief

there
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
King

ruin
have
begin
in
a
favourite
,
so
it
seem
likely
to
end
in
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
poor
a
creature
to
rely
at
all
upon
himself
;
and
his
new
favourite
be
one
HUGH
LE
DESPENSER
,
the
son
of
a
gentleman
of
ancient
family
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh

handsome
and
brave
,
but
he
be
the
favourite
of
a
weak
King
,
whom
no
man
care
a
rush
for
,
and
that
be
a
dangerous
place
to
hold
.
 
<EOS>
the
Nobles
league
against
him
,
because
the
King
like
him
;
and
they
lay
in
wait
,
both
for

the
daughter
of
the
late
Earl
of
Gloucester

and
have
give
both
him
and
his

possession
in
Wales

<EOS>
in
their
endeavour
to
extend
these

they
give
violent
offence
to
an
angry
Welsh
gentleman
,
name
JOHN

and
to
diver
other
angry
Welsh
gentleman
,
who
resort
to
arm
,
take

and
seize
their
estate

the
Earl
of
Lancaster
have
first
place
the
favourite
(
who
be
a
poor
relation
of
his
own
)
at
Court
,
and
he
consider
his
own
dignity
offend
by
the
preference
he
receive
and
the
honour
he
acquire
;
so
he
,
and
the
baron
who
be
his
friend
,
join
the
Welshmen
,
march
on
London
,
and
send
a
message
to
the

<EOS>
at
first

the
King
unaccountably
take
it
into
his
head
to
be
spirit

bold
reply
;
but
when
they
quarter

and
go
down

armed
,
to
the
Parliament
at
Westminster

the

that

any

<EOS>
He
be
a
venerable
old
man
,
upwards
of
ninety
year
of
age
,
but
his

He

,
and
hang
upon
a
gallow
fifty
foot
high
,
with
a
chaplet
of
nettle
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
poor
old
father
and
<EOS>
he
be
innocent
enough
of
any
bad
crime
than
the
crime
of
have
be
friend
of
a
King
,
on
whom
,
as
a
mere
man
,
they
would
never
have
deign
to
cast
a
favourable
look
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
crime
,
I
know
,
and
lead
to
bad
;
but
,
many
lord
and
gentleman
---
I
even
think
some
lady
,
too
,
if
I
recollect
right
---
have
commit
it
in
England
,
who
have
neither
be
give
to
the
dog
,
nor
hang
up
fifty
foot
high
.
  
<EOS>
the
wretched
King
be
run
here
and
there
,
all
this
time
,
and
never
get
anywhere
in
particular
,
until
he
give
himself
up
,
and
be
take
off
to
Kenilworth
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
safely
lodge
there
,
the
Queen
go
to
London
and
meet
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
Bishop
of
Hereford
,
who
be
the
most
skilful
of
her
friend
,
say
,
what
be
to
be
do
now
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
an
imbecile
,
indolent
,
miserable
King
upon
the
throne
;
would
not
it
be
well
to
take
him
off
,
and
put
his
son
there
instead
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
the
Queen
really
pity
him
at
this
pass
,
but
she
begin
to
cry
;
so
,
the
Bishop
say
,
well
,
my
Lords
and
Gentlemen
,
what
do
you
think
,
upon
the
whole
,
of
send
down
to
Kenilworth
,
and
see
if
His
Majesty
(
God
bless
him
,
and
forbid
we
should
depose
him
!
)
<EOS>
will
not
resign
?
  
<EOS>
My
Lords
and
Gentlemen
think
it
a
good
notion
,
so
a
deputation
of
them
go
down
to
Kenilworth
;
and
there
the
King
come
into
the
great
hall
of
the
Castle
,
commonly
dress
in
a
poor
black
gown
;
and
when
he
see
a
certain
bishop
among
them
,
fall
down
,
poor
feeble
-
headed
man
,
and
make
a
wretched
spectacle
of
himself
.
<EOS>
somebody
lift
him
up
,
and
then
SIR
WILLIAM
TRUSSEL
,
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
almost
frighten
him
to
death
by
make
him
a
tremendous
speech
to
the
effect
that
he
be
no
longer
a
King
,
and
that
everybody
renounce
allegiance
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
,
SIR
THOMAS
BLOUNT
,
the
Steward
of
the
Household
,
nearly
finish
him
,
by
come
forward
and
break
his
white
wand
---
which
be
a
ceremony
only
perform
at
a
King
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
be
ask
in
this
press
manner
what
he
think
of
resign
,
the
King
say
he
think
it
be
the
good
thing
he
could
do
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
do
it
,
and
they
proclaim
his
son
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
close
his
history
by
say
that
he
live
a
harmless
life
in
the
Castle
and
the
Castle
garden
at
Kenilworth
,
many
year
---
that
he
have
a
favourite
,
and
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
---
and
,
have
that
,
want
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
shamefully
humiliate
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
outraged
,
and
slight
,
and
have
dirty
water
from
ditch
give
him
to
shave
with
,
and
weep
and
say
he
would
have
clean
warm
water
,
and
be
altogether
very
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
move
from
this
castle
to
that
castle
,
and
from
that
castle
to
the
other
castle
,
because
this
lord
or
that
lord
,
or
the
other
lord
,
be
too
kind
to
him
:
 
until
<EOS>
at
last
he
come
to
Berkeley
Castle
,
near
the
River
Severn
,
where
(
the
Lord
Berkeley
be
then
ill
and
absent
)
<EOS>
he
fall
into
the
hand
of
two
black
ruffian
,
call
THOMAS
GOURNAY
and
WILLIAM
OGLE
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
---
it

of
September
the
twenty

one
thousand

dreadful
scream

by
the
startled
people
in
the
neighbouring
town
,
ring
through
the
thick
wall
of
the
Castle
,
and
the
dark
,
deep
night
;
and
they
say
,
as
they
be
thus
horribly
awaken
from
their
sleep
,
"
May
Heaven
be
merciful
to
the
King

for
those

"
 
<EOS>
next
morning
he
be
dead
---
not
bruise
,
or
stab
,
or
mark
upon
the
body
,
but
much
distorted
in
the
face
;
and
it
be
whisper
afterwards
,
that
those
two
villain
,
Gournay
and
Ogle
,
have
burn
up
his
inside
with
a
red

hot
iron
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
ever
come
near
Gloucester
,
and
see
the
centre
tower
of
its
beautiful
Cathedral
,
with
its
four
rich
pinnacle

rise
lightly
in

you

remember
that
the
wretched
Edward

ROGER

,
the
Queen

lover
(
who

in
the

)
,
be
far
from
profit
by
the
example
he
have
have
of
the
fate
of
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
have
,
through
the
Queen
's
influence
,
come
into
possession
of
the
estate
of
the
two
despenser
,
he
become
extremely
proud
and
ambitious
,
and
seek
to
be
the
real
ruler
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
King
,
who
be
crown
at
fourteen
year
of
age
with
all
the
usual
solemnity
,
resolve
not
to
bear
this
,
and
soon
pursue
Mortimer
to
his
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
themselves
be
not
fond
of
Mortimer
---
first
,
because
he
be
a
Royal
favourite
;
secondly
,
because
he
be
suppose
to
have
help
to
make
a
peace
with
Scotland
which
now
take
place
,
and
in
virtue
of
which
the
young
King

sister
Joan
,
only
seven
year
old
,
be
promise
in
marriage
to
David
,
the
son
and

of
Robert

who

<EOS>
the
noble
hate
Mortimer
because
of
his
pride
,
rich
,
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
so
far
as
to
take
up
arm
against
him
;
but
be
oblige
to
submit
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Kent
,
one
of
those
who
do
so
,
but
who
afterwards
go
over
to
Mortimer
and
the
Queen
,
be
make
an
example
of
in
the
follow
cruel
manner
:
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
be
anything
but
a
wise
old
earl
;
and
he
be
persuade
by
the
agent
of
the
favourite
and
the
Queen
,
that
poor
King
Edward
the
Second
be
not
really
dead
;
and
thus
be
betray
into
write
letter
favour
his
rightful
claim
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
this
be
make
out
to
be
high
treason
,
and
he
be
try
,
find
guilty
,
and
sentence
to
be
execute
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
the
poor
old
lord
outside
the
town
of
Winchester
,
and
there
keep
him
wait
some
three
or
four
hour
until
they
could
find
somebody
to
cut
off
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
a
convict
say
he
would
do
it
,
if
the
government
would
pardon
him
in
return
;
and
they
give
him
the
pardon
;
and
at
one
blow
he
put
the
Earl
of
Kent
out
of
his
last
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
Queen
be
in
France
,
she
have
find
a
lovely
and
good
young
lady
,
name
Philippa
,
who
she
think
would
make
an
excellent
wife
for
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
King
marry
this
lady
,
soon
after
he
come
to
the
throne
;
and
her
first
child
,
Edward
,
Prince
of
Wales
,
afterwards
become
celebrate
,
as
we
shall
presently
see
,
under
the
famous
title
of
EDWARD
the
BLACK
PRINCE
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
king
,
think
the
time
ripe
for
the
downfall
of
Mortimer
,
take
counsel
with
Lord
Montacute
how
he
should
proceed
.
<EOS>
a
Parliament
be
go
to
be
hold
at
Nottingham
,
and
that
lord
recommend
that
the
favourite
should
be
seize
by
night
in
Nottingham
Castle
,
where
he
be
sure
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
this
,
like
many
other
thing
,
be
more
easily
say
than
do
;
because
,
to
guard
against
treachery
,
the
great
gate
of
the
Castle
be
lock
every
night
,
and
the
great
key
be
carry
up
-
stair
to
the
Queen
,
who
lay
them
under
her
own
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Castle
have
a
governor
,
and
the
governor
be
Lord
Montacute
's
friend
,
confide
to
him
how
he
know
of
a
secret
passage
underground
,
hide
from
observation
by
the
weed
and
bramble
with
which
it
be
overgrow
;
and
how
,
through
that
passage
,
the
conspirator
may
enter
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
go
straight
to
Mortimer
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
upon
a
certain
dark
night
,
at
midnight
,
they
make
their
way
through
this
dismal
place
:
 
startle
the
rat
,
and
frighten
the
owl
and
bat
:
 
and
come
safely
to
the
bottom
of
the
main
tower
of
the
Castle
,
where
the
king
meet
them
,
and
take
them
up
a
profoundly
-
dark
staircase
in
a
deep
silence
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
hear
the
voice
of
Mortimer
in
council
with
some
friend
;
and
burst
into
the
room
with
a
sudden
noise
,
take
him
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
cry
out
from
her
bed
-
chamber
,
"
oh
,
my
sweet
son
,
my
dear
son
,
spare
my
gentle
Mortimer
!
"
<EOS>
They
carry
him
off
,
however
;
and
,
before
the
next
Parliament
,
accuse
him
of
have
make
difference
between
the
young
King
and
his
mother
,
and
of
have
bring
about
the
death
of
the
Earl
of
Kent
,
and
even
of
the
late
King
;
for
,
as
you
know
by
this
time
,
when
they
want
to
get
rid
of
a
man
in
those
old
day
,
they
be
not
very
particular
of
what
they
accuse
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mortimer
be
find
guilty
of
all
this
,
and
be
sentence
to
be
hang
at
Tyburn
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
shut
his
mother
up
in
genteel
confinement
,
where
she
pass
the
rest
of
her
life
;
and
now
he
become
King
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
effort
he
make
be
to
conquer
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
the
english
lord
who
have
land
in
Scotland
,
find
that
their
right
be
not
respect
under
the
late
peace
,
make
war
on
their
own
account
:
choose
for
their
general
,
Edward
,
the
son
of
John
Baliol
,
who
make
such
a
vigorous
fight
,
that
in
less
than
two
month
he
win
the
whole
Scottish
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
join
,
when
thus
triumphant
,
by
the
King
and
Parliament
;
and
he
and
the
King
in
person
besiege
the
scottish
force
in
Berwick
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
scottish
army
come
to
the
assistance
of
their
countryman
,
such
a
furious
battle
ensue
,
that
thirty
thousand
man
be
say
to
have
be
kill
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Baliol
be
then
crown
King
of
Scotland
,
do
homage
to
the
King
of
England
;
but
little
come
of
his
success
after
all
,
for
the
scottish
man
rise
against
him
,
within
no
very
long
time
,
and
David
Bruce
come
back
within
ten
year
and
take
his
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
France
be
a
far
rich
country
than
Scotland
,
and
the
King
have
a
much
great
mind
to
conquer
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
let
Scotland
alone
,
and
pretend
that
he
have
a
claim
to
the
french
throne
in
right
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
in
reality
,
no
claim
at
all
;
but
that
matter
little
in
those
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
over
to
his
cause
many
little
prince
and
sovereign
,
and
even
court
the
alliance
of
the
people
of
flander
---
a
busy
,
work
community
,
who
have
very
small
respect
for
king
,
and
whose
head
man
be
a
brewer
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
force
as
he
raise
by
these
mean
,
Edward
invade
France
;
but
he
do
little
by
that
,
except
run
into
debt
in
carry
on
the
war
to
the
extent
of
three
hundred
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
year
he
do
better
;
gain
a
great
sea
-
fight
in
the
harbour
of
Sluys
.
 
<EOS>
this
success
,
however
,
be
very
shortlived
,
for
the
Flemings
take
fright
at
the
siege
of
Saint
Omer
and
run
away
,
leave
their
weapon
and
baggage
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
Philip
,
the
french
King
,
come
up
with
his
army
,
and
Edward
be
very
anxious
to
decide
the
war
,
propose
to
settle
the
difference
by
single
combat
with
him
,
or
by
a
fight
of
one
hundred
knight
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
french
King
say
,
he
thank
him
;
but
be
very
well
as

to
alarm
the
english
archer

but
,
the
English
would
have
hear

shout
three
thousand

<EOS>
at

the
cross

bowmen
go

the

<EOS>
five

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
in

King

many
wooden

that
it

<EOS>
early
in

the
useless
mouth

to
the
number

<EOS>
King
Edward
allow
them
to
pass
through
his
line
,
and
even
feed
them
,
and
dismiss
them
with
money
;
but
,
later
in
the
siege
,
he
be
not
so
merciful
---
five
hundred
more
,
who
be
afterwards
drive
out
,
die

starvation
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
the
garrison
be
so
hard
-
press
at

,
that
they
send
a
letter
to
King
Philip
,
tell

that
they

eat
all
the

,
all
the

and
all

that
if
he
do
not
relieve
them
,
they
must
either
surrender
to
the
English
,
or
eat
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Philip
make
one
effort
to
give
them
relief
;
but
they
be
so
hem
in
by
the
english
power
,
that
he
could
not
succeed
,
and
be
fain
to
leave
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
they
hoist
the
english
flag
,
and
surrender
to
King
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
your

"
say
he
to
the
humble

who
come

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
Governor
of
Calais
relate
this
to
the
people
in
the
market
-
place
,
there
be
great
weeping
and
distress
;
in
the
midst
of
which
,
one
worthy
citizen
,
name
Eustace
de
Saint
Pierre
,
rise
up
and
say
,
that
if
the
six
man
require
be
not
sacrifice
,
the
whole
population
would
be
;
therefore
,
he
offer
himself
as
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
bright
example
,
five
other
worthy
citizen
rise
up
one
after
another
,
and
offer
themselves
to
save
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
Governor
,
who
be
too
badly
wound
to
be
able
to
walk
,
mount
a
poor
old
horse
that
have
not
be
eat
,
and
conduct
these
good
man
to
the
gate
,
while
all
the
people
cry
and
mourn
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
receive
them
wrathfully
,
and
order
the
head
of
the
whole
six
to
be
strike
off
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
good
Queen
fall
upon
her
knee
,
and
besought
the
King
to
give
them
up
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
reply
,
"
I
wish
you
have
be
somewhere
else
;
but
I
can
not
refuse
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
she
have
them
properly
dress
,
make
a
feast
for
them
,
and
send
them
back
with
a
handsome
present
,
to
the
great
rejoicing
of
the
whole
camp
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
people
of
Calais
love
the
daughter
to
whom
she
give
birth
soon
afterwards
,
for
her
gentle
mother
's
sake

now

the
wretched

in
such
enormous
number

that
one

half
of

of
differ
and
quarrel
,
the
Prince
of
Wales
again
invade
France
with
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
through
the
south
of
the
country
,
burn
and
plunder
<EOS>
wheresoever
he
go
;
while
his
father
,
who
have
still
the
scottish
war
upon
his
hand
,
do
the
like
in
Scotland
,
but
be
harass
and
worry
in
his
retreat
from
that
country
by
the
scottish
man
,
who
repay
his
cruelty
with
interest
.
  
<EOS>
the
french
King
,
Philip
,
be
now
dead
,
and
be
succeed
by
his
son
John
.
 
<EOS>
the
Black
Prince
,
call
by
that
name
from
the
colour
of
the
armour
he
wear
to
set
off
his
fair
complexion
,
continue
to
burn
and
destroy
in
France
,
rouse
John
into
determined
opposition
;
and
so
cruel
have
the
Black
Prince
be
in
his
campaign
,
and
so
severely
have
the
french
peasant
suffer
,
that
he
could
not
find
one
who
,
for
love
,
or
money
,
or
the
fear
of
death
,
would
tell
him
what
the
french
King
be
do
,
or
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
he
come
upon
the
french
King
's
force
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
near
the
town
of
Poitiers
,
and
find
that
the
whole
neighbouring
country
be
occupy
by
a
vast
french
army
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
help
us
!
"
say
the
Black
Prince
,
"
we
must
make
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
the
eighteenth
of
September
,
the
Prince
whose
army
be
now
reduce
to
ten
thousand
man
in
all
---
prepared
to
give
battle
to
the
french
King
,
who
have
sixty
thousand
horse
alone
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
so
engaged
,
there
come
ride
from
the
french
camp
,
a
Cardinal
,
who
have
persuade
John
to
let
him
offer
term
,
and
try
to
save
the
shedding
of
christian
blood
.
 
<EOS>
"
save

"
say
the
Prince
to
this
good
priest
,
"
and
save
the
honour
of
my
army
,
and
I
will
make
any
reasonable
term
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
offer
to
give
up
all
the
town
,
castle
,
and
prisoner
,
he
have
take
,
and
to
swear
to
make
no
war
in
France
for
seven
year
;
but
,
as
John
would
hear
of
nothing
but
his
surrender
,
with
a
hundred
of
his
chief
knight
,
the
treaty
be
break
off
,
and
<EOS>
the
Prince
say
quietly
---
"
God
defend
the
right
;
we
shall
fight
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
therefore
,
on
the
Monday
morning
,
at
break
of
day
,
the
two
army
prepare
for
battle
.
 
<EOS>
the
English
be
post
in
a
strong
place
,
which
could
only
be
approach
by
one
narrow
lane
,
skirt
by
hedge
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
French
attack
them
by
this
lane
;
but
be
so
gall
and
slay
by
English
arrow
from
behind
the
hedge
,
that
they
be
force
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
then
go
six
hundred
english
bowman
round
about
,
and
,
come
upon
the
rear
of
the
french
army
,
rain
arrow
on
them
thick
and
fast
.
 
<EOS>
the
french
knight
,
throw
into
confusion
,
quit
their
banner
and
disperse
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
say
Sir
John
Chandos
to
the
Prince
,
"
ride
forward
,
noble
Prince
,
and
the
day
be
yours
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
of
France
be
so
valiant
a
gentleman
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
he
will
never
fly
,
and
may
be
take
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
Prince
to
this
,
"
Advance
,
english
banner
,
in
the
name
of
God
and
St
George
!
"
<EOS>
and
on
they
press
until
they
come
up
with
the
french
King
,
fight
fiercely
with
his
battle
-
axe
,
and
,
when
all
his
noble
have
forsake
him
,
attend
faithfully
to
the
last
by
his
young
son
Philip
,
only
sixteen
year
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
Father
and
son
fight
well
,
and
the
King
have
already
two
wound
in
his
face
,
and
have
be
beat
down
,
when
he
at
last
deliver
himself
to
a
banished
french
knight
,
and
give
him
his
right
-
hand
glove
in
token
that
he
have
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
the
Black
Prince
be
generous
as
well
as
brave
,
and
he
invite
his
royal
prisoner
to
supper
in
his
tent
,
and
wait
upon
him
at
table
,
and
,
when
they
afterwards
ride
into
London
in
a
gorgeous
procession
,
mount
the
french
King
on
a
fine
cream
-
colour
horse
,
and
ride
at
his
side
on
a
little
pony
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
kind
,
but
I
think
it
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
theatrical
too
,
and
have
be
make
more
meritorious
than
it
deserve
to
be
;
especially
as
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
great
kindness
to
the
King
of
France
would
have
be
not
to
have
show
him
to
the
people
at
all
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
must
be
say
,
for
these
act
of
politeness
,
that
,
in
course
of
time
,
they
do
much
to
soften
the
horror
of
war
and
the
passion
of
conqueror
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
long
time
before
the
common
soldier
begin
to
have
the
benefit
of
such
courtly
deed
;
but
they
do
at
last
;
and
thus
it
be
possible
that
a
poor
soldier
who
ask
for
quarter
at
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
or
any
other
such
great
fight
,
may
have
owe
his
life
indirectly
to
Edward
the
Black
Prince
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
there
stand
in
the
Strand
,
in
London
,
a
palace
call
the
Savoy
,
which
be
give
up
to
the
captive
King
of
France
and
his
son
for
their
residence
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
King
of
Scotland
have
now
be
King
Edward
's
captive
for
eleven
year
too
,
his
success
be
,
at
this
time
,
tolerably
complete
.
 
<EOS>
the
scottish
business
be
settle
by
the
prisoner
be
release
under
the
title
of
Sir
David
,
King
of
Scotland
,
and
by
his
engage
to
pay
a
large
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
the
state
of
France
encourage
England
to
propose
hard
term
to
that
country
,
where
the
people
rise
against
the
unspeakable
cruelty
and
barbarity
of
its
noble
;
where
the
noble
rise
in
turn
against
the
people
;
where
the
most
frightful
outrage
be
commit
on
all
side
;
and
where
the
insurrection
of
the
peasant
,
call
the
insurrection
of
the
Jacquerie
,
from
Jacques
,
a
common
christian
name
among
the
country
people
of
France
,
awaken
terror
and
hatred
that
have
scarcely
yet
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
a
treaty
call
the
Great
Peace
,
be
at

under
which
King
Edward
agree
to
give
up
the
great

of
his
conquest

King
John

within
six
year

a
ransom

three
million
crown

<EOS>
He
be
so
beset
by
his

noble

courtier
for
have
yield
to
these
condition
---
though
they
could
help
him
to
no

<EOS>
that
he
come
back
of
his
own
will
to
his
old
palace

prison
of

there
die

<EOS>
there
be
a
Sovereign

call
PEDRO
the
CRUEL

who
deserve
the
name
remarkably
well
:
 
<EOS>
have

<EOS>
this
amiable

Prince

now
married
to
his
cousin
JOAN

a
pretty
widow

be
reside

and
besought
his
help

<EOS>
the
Prince
,
who
take
to
him
much
more
kindly
than
a
prince
of
such
fame
ought
to
have
take
to
such
a
ruffian
,
readily
listen
to
his
fair
promise
,
and
agree
to
help
him
,
send
secret
order
to
some
troublesome
disband
soldier
of
his

his
father

,
who
call
themselves
the
Free
Companions
,
and
who
have
be
a
pest
to
the
french
people
,
for
some
time
,
to
aid
this
Pedro
.
 
<EOS>
the
Prince
,
himself
,
go
into
Spain
to
head
the
army
of
relief
,
soon
set
Pedro
on
his

where
he
no

find
himself

than
,
<EOS>
of
course

he
behave
like
the
villain
he
be
,
break
his
word
without
the
least
shame
,
and
abandon
all
the
promise
he
have
make
to
the
Black
Prince
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
have
cost
the
Prince
a
good
deal
of
money
to
pay
soldier
to
support
this
murderous
King
;
and
find
himself
,
when
he
come
back
disgusted
to
Bordeaux
,
not
only
in
bad
health
,
but
deeply
in
debt
,
he
begin
to
tax
his
french
subject
to
pay
his
creditor
.
 
<EOS>
They
appeal
to
the
french
King
,
CHARLES
;
war
again
break
out
;
and
the
french
town
of
Limoges
,
which
the
Prince
have
greatly
benefit
,
go
over
to
the
french
King
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
he
ravage
the
province
of
which
it
be
the
capital
;
burn
,
and
plunder
,
and
kill
in
the
old
sickening
way
;
and
refuse
mercy
to
the
prisoner
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
take
in
the
offending
town
,
though
he
be
so
ill
<EOS>
and
so
much
in
need
of
pity
himself
from
Heaven
,
that
he
be
carry
in
a
litter
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
to
come
home
and
make
himself
popular
with
the
people
and
Parliament
,
and
he
die
on
Trinity
Sunday
,
the
eighth
of
June
,
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
six
,
at
forty

six
year
old

<EOS>
the
whole
nation
mourn
for
him
as
one
of
the
most
renowned
and
beloved
prince
it
have
ever
have
;
and
he
be
bury
with
great
lamentation
in
Canterbury
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
near
to
the
tomb
of
Edward
the
Confessor
,
his
monument
,
with
his
figure
,
carve
in
stone
,
and
represent
in
the
old
black
armour
,
lie
on
its
back
,
may
be
see
at
this
day
,
with
an
ancient
coat
of
mail
,
a
helmet
,
and
a
pair
of
gauntlet
hang
from
a
beam
above
it
,
which
most
people
like
to
believe
be
once
wear
by
the
Black
Prince
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
do
not
outlive
his
renowned
son
,
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
old
,
and
one
Alice
Perrers
,
a
beautiful
lady
,
have
contrive
to
make
him
so
fond
of
her
in
his
old
age
,
that
he
could
refuse
her
nothing
,
and
make
himself
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
She
little
deserve
his
love
,
or
---
what
I
dare
say
she
value
a
great
deal
more
---
<EOS>
the
jewel
of
the
late
Queen
,
which
he
give
her
among
other
rich
present
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
the
very
ring
from
his
finger
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
he
die
,
and
leave
him
to
be
pillage
by
his
faithless
servant
.
 
<EOS>
only
one
good
priest
be
true
to
him
,
and
attend
him
to
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
besides
be
famous
for
the
great
victory
I
have
relate
,
the
reign
of
King
Edward
the
Third
be
render
memorable
in
well
way
,
by
the
growth
of
architecture
and
the
erection
of
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
in
well
way
still
,
by
the
rise
up
of
WICKLIFFE
,
originally
a
poor
parish
priest
:
 
who
devote
himself
to
expose
,
with
wonderful
power
and
success
,
the
ambition
and
corruption
of
the
Pope
,
and
of
the
whole
church
of
which
he
be
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
those
fleming
be
induce
to
come
to
England
in
this
reign
too
,
and
to
settle
in
Norfolk
,
where
they
make
better
woollen
cloth
than
the
English
have
ever
have
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
order
of
the
Garter
(
a
very
fine
thing
in
its
way
,
but
hardly
so
important
as
good
clothe
for
the
nation
)
also
date
from
this
period
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
say
to
have
pick
"
up
a
lady
's
garter
at
a
ball
,
and
to
have
say
,
HONI
SOIT
<EOS>
QUI
MAL
Y
PENSE
---
in
English
<EOS>
,
"
evil
be
to
him
who
evil
think
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
courtier
be
usually
glad
to
imitate
what
the
King
say
or
do
,
and
hence
from
a
slight
incident
the
order
of
the
Garter
be
institute
,
and
become
a
great
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
story
go
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Richard
<EOS>
the
Second
    
RICHARD
,
son
of
the
Black
Prince
,
a
boy
eleven
year
of
age
,
succeed
to
the
Crown
under
the
title
of
King
Richard
the
Second
.
<EOS>
the
whole
english
nation
be
ready
to
admire
him
for
the
sake
of
his
brave
father
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
lord
and
lady
about
the
Court
,
they
declare
him
to
be
the
most
beautiful
,
the
wise
,
and
the
good
---
even
of
prince
---
whom
the
lord
and
lady
about
the
Court
,
generally
declare
to
be
the
most
beautiful
,
the
wise
,
and
the
good
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
to
flatter
a
poor
boy
in
this
base
manner
be
not
a
very
likely
way
to
develop
whatever
good
be
in
him
;
and
it
bring
him
to
anything
but
a
good
or
happy
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
the
young
King
's
uncle
---
commonly
call
John
of
Gaunt
,
from
have
be
bear
at
Ghent
,
which
the
common
people
so
pronounced
---
be
suppose
to
have
some
thought
of
the
throne
himself
;
but
,
as
he
be
not
popular
,
and
the
memory
of
the
Black
Prince
be
,
he
submit
to
his
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
the
war
with
France
be
still
unsettle
,
the
Government
of
England
want
money
to
provide
for
the
expense
that
may
arise
out
of
it
;
accordingly
a
certain
tax
,
call
the
Poll
-
tax
,
which
have
originate
in
the
last
reign
,
be
order
to
be
levy
on
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
tax
on
every
person
in
the
kingdom
,
male
and
female
,
above
the
age
of
fourteen
,
of
three
groat
(
or
three
four
-
penny
piece
)
a
year
;
clergyman
be
charge
more
,
and
only
beggar
be
exempt
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
need
to
repeat
that
the
common
people
of
England
have
long
be
suffer
under
great
oppression
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
still
the
mere
slave
of
the
lord
of
the
land
on
which
they
live
,
and
be
on
most
occasion
harshly
and
unjustly
treat
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
they
have
begin
by
this
time
to
think
very
seriously
of
not
bear
quite
so
much
;
and
,
probably
,
be
embolden
by
that
french
insurrection
I
mention
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
of
Essex
rise
against
the
Poll
-
tax
,
and
be
severely
handle
by
the
government
officer
,
kill
some
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
very
time
one
of
the
tax
-
collector
,
go
his
round
from
house
to
house
,
at
Dartford
in
Kent
come
to
the
cottage
of
one
WAT
,
a
tiler
by
trade
,
and
claim
the
tax
upon
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
who
be
at
home
,
declare
that
she
be
under
the
age
of
fourteen
;
upon
that
,
the
collector
(
as
other
collector
have
already
do
in
different
part
of
England
)
behave
in
a
savage
way
,
and
brutally
insult
Wat
Tyler
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
daughter
scream
,
the
mother
scream
.
 
<EOS>
Wat
<EOS>
the
Tiler
,
who
be
at
work
not
far
off
,
run
to
the
spot
,
and
do
what
any
honest
father
under
such
provocation
may
have
do
---
strike
the
collector
dead
at
a
blow
.
  
<EOS>
instantly
the
people
of
that
town
uprose
as
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
Wat
Tyler
their
leader
;
they
join
with
the
people
of
Essex
,
who
be
in
arm
under
a
priest
call
JACK
STRAW
;
they
take
out
of
prison
another
priest
name
JOHN
BALL
;
and
gather
in
number
as
they
go
along
,
advanced
,
in
a
great
confused
army
of
poor
man
,
to
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
they
want
to
abolish
all
property
,
and
to
declare
all
man
equal
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
this
very
likely
;
because
they
stop
the
traveller
on
the
road
and
make
them
swear
to
be
true
to
King
Richard
and
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
they
at
all
dispose
to
injure
those
who
have
do
them
no
harm
,
merely
because
they
be
of
high
station
;
for
,
the
King
's
mother
,
who
have
to
pass
through
their
camp
at
Blackheath
,
on
her
way
to
her
young
son
,
lie
for
safety
in
the
Tower
of
London
,
have
merely
to
kiss
a
few
dirty
-
faced
rough
-
bearded
man
who
be
noisily
fond
of
royalty
,
and
so
get
away
in
perfect
safety
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
the
whole
mass
march
on
to
London
Bridge
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
drawbridge
in
the
middle
,
which
WILLIAM
WALWORTH
the
Mayor
cause
to
be
raise
to
prevent
their
come
into
the
city
;
but
they
soon
terrify
the
citizen
into
lower
it
again
,
and
spread
themselves
,
with
great
uproar
,
over
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
They
break
open
the
prison
;
they
burn
the
paper
in
Lambeth
Palace
;
they
destroy
the
DUKE
of
LANCASTER
's
Palace
,
the
Savoy
,
in
the
Strand
,
say
to
be
the
most
beautiful
and
splendid
in
England
;
they
set
fire
to
the
book
and
document
in
the
Temple
;
and
make
a
great
riot
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
these
outrage
be
commit
in
drunkenness
;
since
those
citizen
,
who
have
well
-
fill
cellar
,
be
only
too
glad
to
throw
them
open
to
save
the
rest
of
their
property
;
but
even
the
drunken
rioter
be
very
careful
to
steal
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
so
angry
with
one
man
,
who
be
see
to
take
a
silver
cup
at
the
Savoy
Palace
,
and
put
it
in
his
breast
,
that
they
drown
him
in
the
river
,
cup
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
King
have
be
take
out
to
treat
with
them
before
they
commit
these
excess
;
but
,
he
and
the
people
about
him
be
so
frightened
by
the
riotous
shout
,
that
they
get
back
to
the
Tower
in
the
good
way
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
the
insurgent
bolder
;
so
they
go
on
riot
away
,
strike
off
the
head
of
those
who
do
not
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
declare
for
King
Richard
and
the
people
;
and
kill
as
many
of
the
unpopular
person
whom
they
suppose
to
be
their
enemy
as
they
could
by
any
mean
lie
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
they
pass
one
very
violent
day
,
and
then
proclamation
be
make
that
the
King
would
meet
them
at
mile
-
end
,
and
grant
their
request
.
  
<EOS>
the
rioter
go
to
mile
-
end
to
the
number
of
sixty
thousand
,
and
the
King
meet
them
there
,
and
to
the
King
the
rioter
peaceably
propose
four
condition
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
that
neither
they
,
nor
their
child
,
nor
any
come
after
them
,
should
be
make
slave
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
the
rent
of
land
should
be
fix
at
a
certain
price
in
money
,
instead
of
be
pay
in
service
.
 
<EOS>
thirdly
,
that
they
should
have
liberty
to
buy
and
sell
in
all
market
and
public
place
,
like
other
free
man
.
 
<EOS>
fourthly
,
that
they
should
be
pardon
for
past
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
know
,
there
be
nothing
very
unreasonable
in
these
proposal
!
 
<EOS>
the
young
King
deceitfully
pretend
to
think
so
,
and
keep
thirty
clerk
up
,
all
night
,
write
out
a
charter
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Wat
Tyler
himself
want
more
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
want
the
entire
abolition
of
the
forest
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
mile
-
end
with
the
rest
,
but
,
while
that
meeting
be
be
hold
,
break
into
the
Tower
of
London
and
slay
the
archbishop
and
the
treasurer
,
for
whose
head
the
people
have
cry
out
loudly
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
man
even
thrust
their
sword
into
the
bed
of
the
Princess
of
Wales
while
the
Princess
be
in
it
,
to
make
certain
that
none
of
their
enemy
be
conceal
there
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Wat
and
his
man
still
continue
armed
,
and
ride
about
the
city
.
<EOS>
next
morning
,
the
King
with
a
small
train
of
some
sixty
gentleman
---
among
whom
be
WALWORTH
the
Mayor
---
ride
into
Smithfield
,
and
see
Wat
and
his
people
at
a
little
distance
.
 
<EOS>
say
Wat
to
his
man
,
"
there
be
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
speak
with
him
,
and
tell
him
what
we
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
Straightway
Wat
ride
up
to
him
,
and
begin
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
"
King
,
"
say
Wat
,
"
dost
thou
see
all
my
man
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
say
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
Wat
,
"
they
be
all
at
my
command
,
and
have
swear
to
do
whatever
I
bid
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
some
declare
afterwards
that
as
Wat
say
this
,
he
lay
his
hand
on
the
King
's
bridle
.
 
<EOS>
other
declare
that
he
be
see
to
play
with
his
own
dagger
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
myself
,
that
he
just
speak
to
the
King
like
a
rough
,
angry
man
as
he
be
,
and
do
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
be
expect
no
attack
,
and
prepare
for
no
resistance
,
when
Walworth
the
Mayor
do
the
not
very
valiant
deed
of
draw
a
short
sword
and
stab
him
in
the
throat
.
 
<EOS>
He
drop
from
his
horse
,
and
one
of
the
King
's
people
speedily
finish
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
fall
Wat
Tyler
.
 
<EOS>
fawner
and
flatterer
make
a
mighty
triumph
of
it
,
and
set
up
a
cry
which
will
occasionally
find
an
echo
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
Wat
be
a
hard
-
working
man
,
who
have
suffer
much
,
and
have
be
foully
outrage
;
and
it
be
probable
that
he
be
a
man
of
a
much
high
nature
and
a
much
brave
spirit
than
any
of
the
parasite
who
exult
then
,
or
have
exult
since
,
over
his
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
see
Wat
down
,
his
man
immediately
bend
their
bow
to
avenge
his
fall
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
young
King
have
not
have
presence
of
mind
at
that
dangerous
moment
,
both
he
and
the
Mayor
to
boot
,
may
have
follow
Tyler
pretty
fast
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
King
ride
up
to
the
crowd
,
cry
out
that
Tyler
be
a
traitor
,
and
that
he
would
be
their
leader
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
so
take
by
surprise
,
that
they
set
up
a
great
shouting
,
and
follow
the
boy
until
he
be
meet
at
Islington
by
a
large
body
of
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
the
end
of
this
rise
be
the
then
usual
end
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
King
find
himself
safe
,
he
unsay
all
he
have
say
,
and
undo
all
he
have
do
;
some
fifteen
hundred
of
the
rioter
be
try
(
mostly
in
Essex
)
with
great
rigour
,
and
execute
with
great
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
them
be
hang
on
gibbet
,
and
leave
there
as
a
terror
to
the
country
people
;
and
,
because
their
miserable
friend
take
some
of
the
body
down
to
bury
,
the
King
order
the
rest
to
be
chain
up
---
which
be
the
beginning
of
the
barbarous
custom
of
hang
in
chain
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
falsehood
in
this
business
make
such
a
pitiful
figure
,
that
I
think
Wat
Tyler
appear
in
history
as
beyond
comparison
the
truer
and
more
respectable
man
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
be
now
sixteen
year
of
age
,
and
marry
Anne
of
Bohemia
,
an
excellent
princess
,
who
be
call
"
the
good
Queen
Anne
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
deserve
a
well
husband
;
for
the
King
have
be
fawn
and
flatter
into
a
treacherous
,
wasteful
,
dissolute
,
bad
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
pope
at
this
time
(
as
if
one
be
not
enough
!
)
,
and
their
quarrel
involve
Europe
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
Scotland
be
still
troublesome
too
;
and
at
home
there
be
much
jealousy
and
distrust
,
and
plotting
and
counter
-
plot
,
because
the
King
fear
the
ambition
of
his
relation
,
and
particularly
of
his
uncle
,
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
and
the
duke
have
his
party
against
the
King
,
and
the
King
have
his
party
against
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
these
home
trouble
lessen
when
the
duke
go
to
Castile
to
urge
his
claim
to
the
crown
of
that
kingdom
;
for
then
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
another
of
Richard
's
uncle
,
oppose
him
,
and
influence
the
Parliament
to
demand
the
dismissal
of
the
King
's
favourite
minister
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
say
in
reply
,
that
he
would
not
for
such
man
dismiss
the
mean
servant
in
his
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
have
begin
to
signify
little
what
a
king
say
when
a
Parliament
be
determine
;
so
Richard
be
at
last
oblige
to
give
way
,
and
to
agree
to
another
Government
of
the
kingdom
,
under
a
commission
of
fourteen
noble
,
for
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
His
uncle
of
Gloucester
be
at
the
head
of
this
commission
,
and
,
in
fact
,
appoint
everybody
compose
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
do
all
this
,
the
King
declare
as
soon
as
he
see
an
opportunity
that
he
have
never
mean
to
do
it
,
and
that
it
be
all
illegal
;
and
he
get
the
judge
secretly
to
sign
a
declaration
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
secret
ooze
out
directly
,
and
be
carry
to
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
at
the
head
of
forty
thousand
man
,
meet
the
King
on
his
entering
into
London
to
enforce
his
authority
;
the
King
be
helpless
against
him
;
his
favourite
and
minister
be
impeach
and
be
mercilessly
execute
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
be
two
man
whom
the
people
regard
with
very
different
feeling
;
one
,
Robert
Tresilian
,
Chief
Justice
,
who
be
hate
for
have
make
what
be
call
"
the
bloody
circuit
"
to
try
the
rioter
;
the
other
,
Sir
Simon
Burley
,
an
honourable
knight
,
who
have
be
the
dear
friend
of
the
Black
Prince
,
and
the
governor
and
guardian
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
gentleman
's
life
the
good
Queen
even
beg
of
Gloucester
on
her
knee
;
but
Gloucester
(
with
or
without
reason
)
fear
and
hate
him
,
and
reply
,
that
if
she
value
her
husband
's
crown
,
she
have
well
beg
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
do
under
what
be
call
by
some
the
wonderful
---
and
by
other
,
with
well
reason
,
the
merciless
---
parliament
.
  
<EOS>
but
Gloucester
's
power
be
not
to
last
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
it
for
only
a
year
longer
;
in
which
year
the
famous
battle
of
Otterbourne
,
sing
in
the
old
ballad
of
Chevy
Chase
,
be
fight
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
year
be
out
,
the
King
,
turn
suddenly
to
Gloucester
,
in
the
midst
of
a
great
council
say
,
"
Uncle
,
how
old
be
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
highness
,
"
return
the
Duke
,
"
be
in
your
twenty
-
second
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
I
so
much
?
"
say
the
King
;
"
then
I
will
manage
my
own
affair
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
,
my
good
lord
,
for
your
past
service
,
but
I
need
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
follow
this
up
,
by
appoint
a
new
Chancellor
and
a
new
Treasurer
,
and
announce
to
the
people
that
he
have
resume
the
Government
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
it
for
eight
year
without
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
through
all
that
time
,
he
keep
his
determination
to
revenge
himself
some
day
upon
his
uncle
Gloucester
,
in
his
own
breast
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
good
Queen
die
,
and
then
the
King
,
desire
to
take
a
second
wife
,
propose
to
his
council
that
he
should
marry
Isabella
,
of
France
,
the
daughter
of
Charles
the
Sixth
:
 
<EOS>
who
,
the
french
courtier
say
(
as
the
english
courtier
have
say
of
Richard
)
,
be
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
wit
,
and
quite
a
phenomenon
---
of
seven
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
the
council
be
divide
about
this
marriage
,
but
it
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
secure
peace
between
England
and
France
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
;
but
it
be
strongly
opposed
to
the
prejudice
of
the
english
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
who
be
anxious
to
take
the
occasion
of
make
himself
popular
,
declaim
against
it
loudly
,
and
this
at
length
decide
the
King
to
execute
the
vengeance
he
have
be
nurse
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
with
a
gay
company
to
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
's

,
Pleshey
Castle
,
in
Essex
,
where
the

suspect
nothing

His

the
Earls
of
Arundel
and
Warwick

be
take
in
the
same
treacherous
manner

<EOS>
a

day
after

at
Nottingham
,
they

high
treason
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Arundel
be
condemn
and
behead
,
and
the
Earl
of
Warwick
be

.
 
<EOS>
then
,
a
writ

by
a
messenger
to
the
Governor
of
Calais
,
require
him
to
send
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
over
to
be
try
.
 
<EOS>
in
three
day
he
return
an
answer
that
he
could
not
do
that
,
because
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
have
die
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
declare
a
traitor
,
his
property
be
confiscate
to
the
King
,
a
real
or
pretended
confession
he
have
make
in
prison
to
one
of
the
Justices
of
the
Common
Pleas
be
produce
against
him
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
unfortunate
duke
die
,
very
few
care
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
really
die
naturally
;
whether
he
kill
himself
;
whether
,
by
the
King
's
order
,
he
be
strangle
,
or
smother
between
two
bed
(
as
a
serve
-
man
of
the
Governor
's
name
Hall
,
do
afterwards
declare
)
,
can
not
be
discover
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
doubt
that
he
be
kill
,
somehow
or
other
,
by
his
nephew
's
order
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
most
active
noble
in
these
proceeding
be
the
King
's
cousin
,
Henry
Bolingbroke
,
whom
the
King
have
make
Duke
of
Hereford
to
smooth
down
the
old
family
quarrel
,
and
some
other
:
 
who
have
in
the
family
-
plot
time
do
<EOS>
just
such
act
themselves
as
they
now
condemn
in
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
have
be
a
corrupt
set
of
man
;
but
such
man
be
easily
find
about
the
court
in
such
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
murmur
at
all
this
,
and
be
still
very
sore
about
the
french
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
the
noble
see
how
little
the
King
care
for
law
,
and
how
crafty
he
be
,
and
begin
to
be
somewhat
afraid
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
life
be
a
life
of
continue
feasting
and
excess
;
his
retinue
,
down
to
the
mean
servant
,
be
dress
in
the
most
costly
manner
,
and
carouse
at
his
table
,
it
be
relate
,
to
the
number
of
ten
thousand
person
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
,
surround
by
a
body
of
ten
thousand
archer
,
and
enrich
by
a
duty
on
wool
which
the
Commons
have
grant
him
for
life
,
see
no
danger
of
ever
be
otherwise
than
powerful
and
absolute
,
and
be
as
fierce
and
haughty
as
a
king
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
two
of
his
old
enemy
leave
,
in
the
person
of
the
duke
of
Hereford
and
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
spare
these
no
more
than
the
other
,
he
tamper
with
the
Duke
of
Hereford
until
he
get
him
to
declare
before
the
Council
that
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
have
lately
hold
some
treasonable
talk
with
him
,
as
he
be
ride
near
Brentford
;
and
that
he
have
tell
him
,
among
other
thing
,
that
he
could
not
believe
the
King
's
oath
---
which
nobody
could
,
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
treachery
he
obtain
a
pardon
,
and
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
be
summon
to
appear
and
defend
himself
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
deny
the
charge
and
say
his
accuser
be
a
liar
and
a
traitor
,
both
nobleman
,
accord
to
the
manner
of
those
time
,
be
hold
in
custody
,
and
the
truth
be
order
to
be
decide
by
wager
of
battle
at
Coventry
.
 
<EOS>
this
wager
of
battle
mean
that
whosoever
win
the
combat
be
to
be
consider
in
the
right
;
which
nonsense
mean
in
effect
,
that
no
strong
man
could
ever
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
holiday
be
make
;
a
great
crowd
assemble
,
with
much
parade
and
show
;
and
the
two
combatant
be
about
to
rush
at
each
other
with
their
lance
,
when
the
King
,
sit
in
a
pavilion
to
see
fair
,
throw
down
the
truncheon
he
carry
in
his
hand
,
and
forbid
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Hereford
be
to
be
banish
for
ten
year
,
and
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
be
to
be
banish
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
so
say
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Hereford
go
to
France
,
and
go
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Holy
Land
,
and
afterwards
die
at
Venice
of
a
broken
heart
.
  
<EOS>
faster
and
fiercer
,
after
this
,
the
King
go
on
in
his
career
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
who
be
the
father
of
the
Duke
of
Hereford
,
die
soon
after
the
departure
of
his
son
;
and
,
the
King
,
although
he
have
solemnly
grant
to
that
son
leave
to
inherit
his
father
's
property
,
if
it
should
come
to
him
during
his
banishment
,
immediately
seize
it
all
,
like
a
robber
.
 
<EOS>
the
judge
be
so
afraid
of
him
,
that
they
disgrace
themselves
by
declare
this
theft
to
be
just
and
lawful
.
 
<EOS>
His
avarice
know
no
bound
.
 
<EOS>
He
outlaw
seventeen
county
at
once
,
on
a
frivolous
pretence
,
merely
to
raise
money
by
way
of
fine
for
misconduct
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
do
as
many
dishonest
thing
as
he
could
;
and
care
so
little
for
the
discontent
of
his
subject
---
though
even
the
spaniel
favourite
begin
to
whisper
to
him
that
there
be
such
a
thing
as
discontent
afloat
---
that
he
take
that
time
,
of
all
other
,
for
leave
England
and
make
an
expedition
against
the
Irish
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
scarcely
go
,
leave
the
DUKE
of
YORK
Regent
in
his
absence
,
when
his
cousin
,
Henry
of
Hereford
,
come
over
from
France
to
claim
the
right
of
which
he
have
be
so
monstrously
deprive
.
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
join
by
the
two
great
earl
of
Northumberland
and
Westmoreland
;
and
his
uncle
,
the
Regent
,
find
the
King
's
cause
unpopular
,
and
the
disinclination
of
the
army
to
act
against
Henry
,
very
strong
,
withdraw
with
the
royal
force
towards
Bristol
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
at
the
head
of
an
army
,
come
from
Yorkshire
(
where
he
have
land
)
to
London
and
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
join
their
force
---
how
they
bring
that
about
,
be
not
distinctly
understand
---
and
proceed
to
Bristol
Castle
,
whither
three
nobleman
have
take
the
young
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
the
castle
surrender
,
they
presently
put
those
three
nobleman
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
Regent
then
remain
there
,
and
Henry
go
on
to
Chester
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
the
boisterous
weather
have
prevent
the
King
from
receive
intelligence
of
what
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
it
be
convey
to
him
in
Ireland
,
and
he
send
over
the
EARL
of
SALISBURY
,
who
,
land
at
Conway
,
rally
the
Welshmen
,
and
wait
for
the
King
a
whole
fortnight
;
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
Welshmen
,
who
be
perhaps
not
very
warm
for
him
in
the
beginning
,
quite
cool
down
and
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
king
do
land
on
the
coast
at
last
,
he
come
with
a
pretty
good
power
,
but
his
man
care
nothing
for
him
,
and
quickly
desert
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
the
Welshmen
to
be
still
at
Conway
,
he
disguise
himself
as
a
priest
,
and
make
for
that
place
in
company
with
his
two
brother
and
some
few
of
their
adherent
.
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
no
Welshmen
leave
---
only
Salisbury
and
a
hundred
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
distress
,
the
King
's
two
brother
,
Exeter
and
Surrey
,
offer
to
go
to
Henry
to
learn
what
his
intention
be
.
<EOS>
Surrey
,
who
be
true
to
Richard
,
be
put
into
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Exeter
,
who
be
false
,
take
the
royal
badge
,
which
be
a
hart
,
off
his
shield
,
and
assume
the
rose
,
the
badge
of
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
,
it
be
pretty
plain
to
the
King
<EOS>
what
Henry
's
intention
be
,
without
send
any
more
messenger
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
the
fallen
King
,
thus
desert
---
<EOS>
hem
in
on
all
side
,
and
press
with
hunger
---
rode
here
and
ride
there
,
and
go
to
this
castle
,
and
go
to
that
castle
,
endeavour
to
obtain
some
provision
,
but
could
find
none
.
 
<EOS>
He
ride
wretchedly
back
to
Conway
,
and
there
surrender
himself
to
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
who
come
from
Henry
,
in
reality
to
take
him
prisoner
,
but
in
appearance
to
offer
term
;
and
whose
man
be
hide
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
earl
he
be
conduct
to
the
castle
of
Flint
,
where
his
cousin
Henry
meet
him
,
and
drop
on
his
knee
as
if
he
be
still
respectful
to
his
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
"
fair
cousin
of
Lancaster
,
"
say
the
King
,
"
you
be
very
welcome
"
<EOS>
(
very
welcome
,
no
doubt
;
but
he
would
have
be
more
so
,
in
chain
or
without
a
head
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
reply
Henry
,
"
I
be
come
a
little
before
my
time
;
but
,
with
your
good
pleasure
,
I
will
show
you
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Your
people
complain
with
some
bitterness
,
that
you
have
rule
them
rigorously
for
two
-
and
-
twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
it
please
God

I
will
help
you
to
govern
them
better
in
future

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fair
cousin
,
"
reply
the
abject
king
,
"
since
it
pleaseth
you
,
it
pleaseth
me
mightily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
the
trumpet
sound
,
and
the
King
be
stick
on
a
wretched
horse
,
and
carry
prisoner
to
Chester
,
where
he
be
make
to
issue
a
proclamation
,
call
a
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
from
Chester
he
be
take
on
towards
London
.
 
<EOS>
at
Lichfield
he
try
to
escape
by
get
out
of
a
window
and
let
himself
down
into
a
garden
;
it
be
all
in
vain
,
however
,
and
he
be
carry
on
and
shut
up
in
the
Tower
,
where
no
one
pity
him
,
and
where
the
whole
people
,
whose
patience
he
have
quite
tired
out
,
reproach
him
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
before
he
get
there
,
it
be
relate
,
that
his
very
dog
leave
him
and
depart
from
his
side
to
lick
the
hand
of
Henry
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
before
the
Parliament
meet
,
a
deputation
go
to
this
wreck
King
,
and
tell
him
that
he
have
promise
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
at
Conway
Castle
to
resign
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
quite
ready
to
do
it
,
and
sign
a
paper
in
which
he
renounce
his
authority
and
absolve
his
people
from
their
allegiance
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
little
spirit
leave
that
he
give
his
royal
ring
to
his
triumphant
cousin
Henry
with
his
own
hand
,
and
say
,
that
if
he
could
have
have
leave
to
appoint
a
successor
,
that
same
Henry
be
the
man
of
all
other
whom
he
would
have
name
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
the
Parliament
assemble
in
Westminster
Hall
,
where
Henry
sit
at
the
side
of
the
throne
,
which
be
empty
and
cover
with
a
cloth
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
the
paper
just
sign
by
the
King
be
read
to
the
multitude
amid
shout
of
joy
,
which
be
echo
through
all
the
street
;
when
some
of
the
noise
have
die
away
,
the
King
be
formally
depose
.
<EOS>
then
Henry
arise
,
and
,
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
and
breast
,
challenge
the
realm
of
England
as
his
right
;
the
archbishop
of
Canterbury
and
York
seat
him
on
the
throne
.
  
<EOS>
the
multitude
shout
again
,
and
the
shout
re
-
echo
throughout
all
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
remember
,
now
,
that
Richard
the
Second
have
ever
be
the
most
beautiful
,
the
wise
,
and
the
good
of
prince
;
and
he
now
make
live
(
to
my
thinking
)
a
far
more
sorry
spectacle
in
the
Tower
of
London
,
than
Wat
Tyler
have
make
,
lie
dead
,
among
the
hoofs
of
the
royal
horse
in
Smithfield
.
  
<EOS>
the
Poll
-
tax
die
with
Wat
.
 
<EOS>
the
Smiths
to
the
King
and
Royal
Family
,
could
make
no
chain
in
which
the
King
could
hang
the
people
's
recollection
of
him
;
so
the
Poll
-
tax
be
never
collect
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Fourth
<EOS>
,
call
Bolingbroke
    
during
the
last
reign
,
the
preaching
of
Wickliffe
against
the
pride
and
cunning
of
the
Pope
and
all
his
man
,
have
make
a
great
noise
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
new
King
wish
to
be
in
favour
with
the
priest
,
or
whether
he
hope
,
by
pretend
to
be
very
religious
,
to
cheat
Heaven
itself
into
the
belief
that
he
be
not
a
usurper
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
both
supposition
be
likely
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
he
begin
his
reign
by
make
a
strong
show
against
the
follower
of
Wickliffe
,
who
be
call
Lollards
,
or
heretic
---
although
his
father
,
John
of
Gaunt
,
have
be
of
that
way
of
thinking
,
as
he
himself
have
be
more
than
suspect
of
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
less
certain
that
he
first
establish
in
England
the
detestable
and
atrocious
custom
,
bring
from
abroad
,
of
burn
those
people
as
a
punishment
for
their
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
importation
into
England
of
one
of
the
practice
of
what
be
call
the
Holy
Inquisition
:
 
<EOS>
which
be
the
most
UNholy
and
the
most
infamous
tribunal
that
ever
disgrace
mankind
,
and
make
man
more
like
demon
than
follower
of
Our
Saviour
.
  
<EOS>
no
real
right
to
the
crown
,
as
you
know
,
be
in
this
King
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
Mortimer
,
the
young
Earl
of
March
---
who
be
only
eight
or
nine
year
old
,
and
who
be
descend
from
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
the
eld
brother
of
Henry
's
father
---
be
,
by
succession
,
the
real
heir
to
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
King
get
his
son
declare
Prince
of
Wales
;
and
,
obtain
possession
of
the
young
Earl
of
March
and
his
little
brother
,
keep
them
in
confinement
(
but
not
severely
)
in
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
require
the
Parliament
to
decide
what
be
to
be
do
with
the
depose
King
,
who
be
quiet
enough
,
and
who
only
say
that
he
hope
his
cousin
Henry
would
be
"
a
good
lord
"
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
reply
that
they
would
recommend
his
be
keep
in
some
secret
place
where
the
people
could
not
resort
,
and
where
his
friend
could
not
be
admit
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
accordingly
pass
this
sentence
upon
him
,
and
it
now
begin
to
be
pretty
clear
to
the
nation
that
Richard
the
Second
would
not
live
very
long
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
noisy
Parliament
,
as
it
be
an
unprincipled
one
,
and
the
Lords
quarrel
so
violently
among
themselves
as
to
which
of
them
have
be
loyal
and
which
disloyal
,
and
which
consistent
and
which
inconsistent
,
<EOS>
that
forty
gauntlet
be
say
to
have
be
throw
upon
the
floor
at
one
time
as
challenge
to
as
many
battle
:
 
the
truth
be
that
they
be
all
false
and
base
together
,
and
have
be
,
at
one
time
with
the
old
King
,
and
at
another
time
with
the
new
one
,
and
seldom
true
for
any
length
of
time
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
begin
to
plot
again
.
 
<EOS>
a
conspiracy
be
form
to
invite
the
King
to
a
tournament
at
Oxford
,
and
then
to
take
him
by
surprise
and
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
murderous
enterprise
,
which
be
agree
upon
at
secret
meeting
in
the
house
of
the
Abbot
of
Westminster
,
be
betray
by
the
Earl
of
Rutland
---
one
of
the
conspirator
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
instead
of
go
to
the
tournament
or
stay
at
Windsor
(
where
the
conspirator
suddenly
go
,
on
find
themselves
discover
,
with
the
hope
of
seize
him
)
,
retire
to
London
,
proclaim
them
all
traitor
,
and
advance
upon
them
with
a
great
force
.
 
<EOS>
They
retire
into
the
west
of
England
,
proclaim
Richard
King
;
but
,
the
people
rise
against
them
,
and
they
be
all
slay
.
<EOS>
Their
treason
hasten
the
death
of
the
depose
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
be
kill
by
hire
assassin
,
or
whether
he
be
starve
to
death
,
or
whether
he
refuse
food
on
hearing
of
his
brother
be
kill
(
who
be
in
that
plot
)
,
be
very
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
He
meet
his
death
somehow
;
and
his
body
be
publicly
show
at
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
with
only
the
low
part
of
the
face
uncover
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
doubt
that
he
be
kill
by
the
King
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
the
french
wife
of
the
miserable
Richard
be
now
only
ten
year
old
;
and
,
when
her
father
,
Charles
of
France
,
hear
of
her
misfortune
and
of
her
lonely
condition
in
England
,
he
go
mad
:
as
he
have
several
time
do
before
,
during
the
last
five
or
six
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
french
Dukes
of
Burgundy
and
Bourbon
take
up
the
poor
girl
's
cause
,
without
care
much
about
it
,
but
on
the
chance
of
get
something
out
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
of
Bordeaux
,
who
have
a
sort
of
superstitious
attachment
to
the
memory
of
Richard
,
because
he
be
bear
there
,
swear
by
the
Lord
that
he
have
be
the
good
man
in
all
his
kingdom
---
which
be
go
rather
far
---
and
promise
to
do
great
thing
against
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
they
come
to
consider
that
they
,
and
the
whole
people
of
France
,
be
ruin
by
their
own
noble
,
and
that
the
English
rule
be
much
the
well
of
the
two
,
they
cool
down
again
;
and
the
two
duke
,
although
they
be
very
great
man
,
could
do
nothing
without
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
begin
negotiation
between
France
and
England
for
the
send
home
to
Paris
of
the
poor
little
Queen
with
all
her
jewel
and
her
fortune
of
two
hundred
thousand
franc
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
quite
willing
to
restore
the
young
lady
,
and
even
the
jewel
;
but
he
say
he
really
could
not
part
with
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
at
last
she
be
safely
deposit
at
Paris
without
her
fortune
,
and
then
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
(
who
be
cousin
to
the
french
King
)
begin
to
quarrel
with
the
Duke
of
Orleans
(
who
be
brother
to
the
french
King
)
about
the
whole
matter
;
and
those
two
duke
make
France
even
more
wretched
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
idea
of
conquer
Scotland
be
still
popular
at
home
,
the
King
march
to
the
river
Tyne
and
demand
homage
of
the
King
of
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
this
being
refuse
,
he
advance
to
Edinburgh
,
but
do
little
there
;
for
,
his
army
be
in
want
of
provision
,
and
the
Scotch
be
very
careful
to
hold
him
in
check
without
give
battle
,
he
be
oblige
to
retire
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
his
immortal
honour
that
in
this
sally
he
burn
no
village
and
slaughter
no
people
,
but
be
particularly
careful
that
his
army
should
be
merciful
and
harmless
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
example
in
those
ruthless
time
.
  
<EOS>
a
war
among
the
border
people
of
England
and
Scotland
go
on
for
twelve
month
,
and
then
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
the
nobleman
who
have
help
Henry
to
the
crown
,
begin
to
rebel
against
him
---
probably
because
nothing
that
Henry
could
do
for
him
would
satisfy
his
extravagant
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
Welsh
gentleman
,
name
OWEN
GLENDOWER
,
who
have
be
a
student
in
one
of
the
Inns
of
Court
,
and
have
afterwards
be
in
the
service
of
the
late
King
,
whose
Welsh
property
be
take
from
him
by
a
powerful
lord
relate
to
the
present
King
,
who
be
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
appeal
for
redress
,
and
get
none
,
he
take
up
arm
,
be
make
an
outlaw
,
and
declare
himself
sovereign
of
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
be
a
magician
;
and
not
only
be
the
Welsh
people
stupid
enough
to
believe
him
,
but
,
even
Henry
believe
him
too
;
for
,
make
three
expedition
into
Wales
,
and
be
three
time
drive
back
by
the
wildness
of
the
country
,
the
bad
weather
,
and
the
skill
of
Glendower
,
he
think
he
be
defeat
by
the
Welshman
's
magic
art
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
take
Lord
Grey
and
Sir
Edmund
Mortimer
,
prisoner
,
and
allow
the
relative
of
Lord
Grey
to
ransom
him
,
but
would
not
extend
such
favour
to
Sir
Edmund
Mortimer
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Henry
Percy
,
call
HOTSPUR
,
son
of
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
who
be
married
to
Mortimer
's
sister
,
be
suppose
to
have
take
offence
at
this
;
and
,
therefore
,
in
conjunction
with
his
father
and
some
other
,
to
have
join
Owen
Glendower
,
and
rise
against
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
clear
that
this
be
the
real
cause
of
the
conspiracy
;
but
perhaps
it
be
make
the
pretext
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
form
,
and
be
very
powerful
;
include
SCROOP
,
Archbishop
of
York
,
and
the
EARL
of
DOUGLAS
,
a
powerful
and
brave
scottish
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
prompt
and
active
,
and
the
two
army
meet
at
Shrewsbury
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
about
fourteen
thousand
man
in
each
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
Earl
of
Northumberland
be
sick
<EOS>
,
the
rebel
force
be
lead
by
his
son
.
<EOS>
the
King
wear
plain
armour
to
deceive
the
enemy
;
and
four
nobleman
,
with
the
same
object
,
wear
the
royal
arm
.
 
<EOS>
the
rebel
charge
be
so
furious
,
that
every
one
of
those
gentleman
be
kill
,
the
royal
standard
be
beat
down
,
and
the
young
Prince
of
Wales
be
severely
wound
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
one
of
the
brave
and
good
soldier
that
ever
live
,
and
he
fight
so
well
,
and
the
King
's
troop
be
so
encourage
by
his
bold
example
,
that
they
rally
immediately
,
and
cut
the
enemy
's
force
all
to
piece
.
<EOS>
Hotspur
be
kill
by
an
arrow
in
the
brain
,
and
the
rout
be
so
complete
that
the
whole
rebellion
be
strike
down
by
this
one
blow
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
surrender
himself
soon
after
hear
of
the
death
of
his
son
,
and
receive
a
pardon
for
all
his
offence
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
lingering
of
rebellion
yet
:
 
<EOS>
Owen
Glendower
be
retire
to
Wales
,
and
a
preposterous
story
be
spread
among
the
ignorant
people
that
King
Richard
be
still
alive
.
 
<EOS>
how
they
could
have
believe
such
nonsense
it
be
difficult
to
imagine
;
but
they
certainly
do
suppose
that
the
Court
fool
of
the
late
King
,
who
be
something
like
him
,
be
he
,
himself
;
so
that
it
seem
as
if
,
after
give
so
much
trouble
to
the
country
in
his
life
,
he
be
still
to
trouble
it
after
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
Earl
of
March
and
his
brother
be
steal
out
of
Windsor
Castle
.
<EOS>
be
retake
,
and
be
find
to
have
be
spirit
away
by
one
Lady
Spencer
,
she
accuse
her
own
brother
,
that
Earl
of
Rutland
who
be
in
the
former
conspiracy
and
be
now
Duke
of
York
,
of
be
in
the
plot
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
he
be
ruin
in
fortune
,
though
not
put
to
death
;
and
then
another
plot
arise
among
the
old
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
some
other
lord
,
and
that
same
Scroop
,
Archbishop
of
York
,
who
be
with
the
rebel
before
.
 
<EOS>
these
conspirator
cause
a
writing
to
be
post
on
the
church
door
,
accuse
the
King
of
a
variety
of
crime
;
but
,
the
King
be
eager
and
vigilant
to
oppose
them
,
they
be
all
take
,
and
the
Archbishop
be
execute
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
that
a
great
churchman
have
be
slay
by
the
law
in
England
;
but
the
King
be
resolve
that
it
should
be
do
,
and
do
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
most
remarkable
event
of
this
time
be
the
seizure
,
by
Henry
,
of
the
heir
to
the
scottish
throne
---
James
,
a
boy
of
nine
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
put
aboard
-
ship
by
his
father
,
the
Scottish
King
Robert
,
to
save
him
from
the
design
of
his
uncle
,
when
,
on
his
way
to
France
,
he
be
accidentally
take
by
some
english
cruiser
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
a
prisoner
in
England
for
nineteen
year
,
and
become
in
his
prison
a
student
and
a
famous
poet
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
occasional
trouble
with
the
Welsh
and
with
the
French
,
the
rest
of
King
Henry
's
reign
be
quiet
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
King
be
far
from
happy
,
and
probably
be
trouble
in
his
conscience
by
know
that
he
have
usurp
the
crown
,
and
have
occasion
the
death
of
his
miserable
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
though
brave
and
generous
,
be
say
to
have
be
wild
and
dissipate
,
and
even
to
have
draw
his
sword
on
GASCOIGNE
,
the
Chief
Justice
of
the
King
's
Bench
,
because
he
be
firm
in
deal
impartially
with
one
of
his
dissolute
companion
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
the
Chief
Justice
be
say
to
have
order
him
immediately
to
prison
;
the
Prince
of
Wales
be
say
to
have
submit
with
a
good
grace
;
and
the
King
be
say
to
have
exclaim
,
"
Happy
be
the
monarch
who
have
so
just
a
judge
,
and
a
son
so
willing
to
obey
the
law
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
doubtful
,
and
so
be
another
story
(
of
which
Shakespeare
have
make
beautiful
use
)
,
that
the
Prince
once
take
the
crown
out
of
his
father
's
chamber
as
he
be
sleep
,
and
try
it
on
his
own
head
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
's
health
sink
more
and
more
,
and
he
become
subject
to
violent
eruption
on
the
face
and
to
bad
epileptic
fit
,
and
his
spirit
sink
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
as
he
be
pray
before
the
shrine
of
St
Edward
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
he
be
seize
with
a
terrible
fit
,
and
be
carry
into
the
Abbot
's
chamber
,
where
he
presently
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
foretold
that
he
would
die
at
Jerusalem
,
which
certainly
be
not
,
and
never
be
,
Westminster
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
Abbot
's
room
have
long
be
call
the
Jerusalem
chamber
,
people
say
it
be
all
the
same
thing
,
and
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
prediction
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
die
on
the
20th
of
March
,
1413
,
in
the
forty
-
seventh
year
of
his
age
,
and
the
fourteenth
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bury
in
Canterbury
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
twice
married
,
and
have
,
by
his
first
wife
,
a
family
of
four
son
and
two
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
consider
his
duplicity
before
he
come
to
the
throne
,
his
unjust
seizure
of
it
,
and
above
all
,
his
make
that
monstrous
law
for
the
burning
of
what
the
priest
call
heretic
,
he
be
a
reasonably
good
king
,
as
king
go
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Fifth
First
Part
    
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Wales
begin
his
reign
like
a
generous
and
honest
man
.
<EOS>
He
set
the
young
Earl
of
March
free
;
he
restore
their
estate
and
their
honour
to
the
Percy
family
,
who
have
lose
them
by
their
rebellion
against
his
father
;
he
order
the
imbecile
and
unfortunate
Richard
to
be
honourably
bury
among
the
king
of
England
;
and
he
dismiss
all
his
wild
companion
,
with
assurance
that
they
should
not
want
,
if
they
would
resolve
to
be
steady
,
faithful
,
and
true
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
much
easy
to
burn
man
than
to
burn
their
opinion
;
and
those
of
the
Lollards
be
spread
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lollards
be
represent
by
the
priest
---
probably
falsely
for
the
most
part
---
to
entertain
treasonable
design
against
the
new
King
;
and
Henry
,
suffer
himself
to
be
work
upon
by
these
representation
,
sacrifice
his
friend
Sir
John
Oldcastle
,
the
Lord
Cobham
,
to
them
,
after
try
in
vain
to
convert
him
by
argument
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
declare
guilty
,
as
the
head
of
the
sect
,
and
sentence
to
the
flame
;
but
he
escape
from
the
Tower
before
the
day
of
execution
(
postpone
for
fifty
day
by
the
King
himself
)
,
and
summon
the
Lollards
to
meet
him
near
London
on
a
certain
day
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
priest
tell
the
King
,
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
there
be
any
conspiracy
beyond
such
as
be
get
up
by
their
agent
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
appoint
,
instead
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
man
,
under
the
command
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
,
in
the
meadow
of
St
Giles
,
the
King
find
only
eighty
man
,
and
no
Sir
John
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
in
another
place
,
an
addle
-
head
brewer
,
who
have
gold
trapping
to
his
horse
,
and
a
pair
of
gilt
spur
in
his
breast
---
expect
to
be
make
a
knight
next
day
by
Sir
John
,
and
so
to
gain
the
right
to
wear
them
---
but
there
be
no
Sir
John
,
nor
do
anybody
give
information
respect
him
,
though
the
King
offer
great
reward
for
such
intelligence
.
<EOS>
thirty
of
these
unfortunate
Lollards
be
hang
and
draw
immediately
,
and
be
then
burn
,
gallow
and
all
;
and
the
various
prison
in
and
around
London
be
cram
full
of
other
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
unfortunate
man
make
various
confession
of
treasonable
design
;
but
,
such
confession
be
easily
get
,
under
torture
and
the
fear
of
fire
,
and
be
very
little
to
be
trust
.
 
<EOS>
to
finish
the
sad
story
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
at
once
,
I
may
mention
that
he
escape
into
Wales
,
and
remain
there
safely
,
for
four
year
.
<EOS>
when
discover
by
Lord
Powis
,
it
be
very
doubtful
if
he
would
have
be
take
alive
---
so
great
be
the
old
soldier
's
bravery
---
if
a
miserable
old
woman
have
not
come
behind
him
and
break
his
leg
with
a
stool
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
carry
to
London
in
a
horse
-
litter
,
be
fasten
by
an
iron
chain
to
a
gibbet
,
and
so
roasted
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
to
make
the
state
of
France
as
plain
as
I
can
in
a
few
word
,
I
should
tell
you
that
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
commonly
call
"
John
without
fear
,
"
have
have
a
grand
reconciliation
of
their
quarrel
in
the
last
reign
,
and
have
appear
to
be
quite
in
a
heavenly
state
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
after
which
,
on
a
Sunday
,
in
the
public
street
of
Paris
,
the
Duke
of
Orleans
be
murder
by
a
party
of
twenty
man
,
set
on
by
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
---
accord
to
his
own
deliberate
confession
.
 
<EOS>
the
widow
of
King
Richard
have
be
marry
in
France
to
the
eld
son
of
the
Duke
of
Orleans
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
mad
king
be
quite
powerless
to
help
her
,
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
become
the
real
master
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
die
,
her
husband
(
Duke
of
Orleans
since
the
death
of
his
father
)
marry
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Armagnac
,
who
,
be
a
much
abler
man
than
his
young
son
-
in
-
law
,
head
his
party
;
thence
call
after
him
Armagnacs
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
France
be
now
in
this
terrible
condition
,
that
it
have
in
it
the
party
of
the
King
's
son
,
the
Dauphin
Louis
;
the
party
of
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
who
be
the
father
of
the
Dauphin
's
ill
-
use
wife
;
and
the
party
of
the
Armagnacs
;
all
hate
each
other
;
all
fighting
together
;
all
compose
of
the
most
depraved
noble
that
the
earth
have
ever
know
;
and
all
tear
unhappy
France
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
the
late
King
have
watch
these
dissension
from
England
,
sensible
(
like
the
french
people
)
that
no
enemy
of
France
could
injure
her
more
than
her
own
nobility
.
 
<EOS>
the
present
King
now
advance
a
claim
to
the
french
throne
.
 
<EOS>
His
demand
be
,
of
course
,
refuse
,
he
reduce
his
proposal
to
a
certain
large
amount
of
french
territory
,
and
to
demand
the
french
princess
,
Catherine
,
in
marriage
,
with
a
fortune
of
two
million
of
golden
crown
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
offer
less
territory
and
few
crown
,
and
no
princess
;
but
he
call
his
ambassador
home
and
prepare
for
war
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
propose
to
take
the
princess
with
one
million
of
crown
.
 
<EOS>
the
French
Court
reply
that
he
should
have
the
princess
with
two
hundred
thousand
crown
less
;
he
say
this
would
not
do
(
he
have
never
see
the
princess
in
his
life
)
,
and
assemble
his
army
at
Southampton
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
short
plot
at
home
just
at
that
time
,
for
depose
him
,
and
make
the
Earl
of
March
king
;
but
the
conspirator
be
all
speedily
condemn
and
execute
,
and
the
King
embark
for
France
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
dreadful
to
observe
how
long
a
bad
example
will
be
follow
;
but
,
it
be
encouraging
to
know
that
a
good
example
be
never
throw
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
first
act
on
disembark
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
Seine
,
three
mile
from
Harfleur
,
be
to
imitate
his
father
,
and
to
proclaim
his
solemn
order
that
the
life
and
property
of
the
peaceable
inhabitant
should
be
respect
on
pain
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
agree
by
french
writer
,
to
his
lasting
renown
,
that
even
while
his
soldier
be
suffer
the
great
distress
from
want
of
food
,
these
command
be
rigidly
obey
.
  
<EOS>
with
an
army
in
all
of
thirty
thousand
man
,
he
besiege
the
town
of
Harfleur
both
by
sea
and
land
for
five
week
;
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
town
surrender
,
and
the
inhabitant
be
allow
to
depart
with
only
fivepence
each
,
and
a
part
of
their
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
rest
of
their
possession
be
divide
amongst
the
english
army
.
<EOS>
but
,
that
army
suffer
so
much
,
in
spite
of
its
success
,
from
disease
and
privation
,
that
it
be
already
reduce
one
half
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
King
be
determine
not
to
retire
until
he
have
strike
a
great
blow
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
against
the
advice
of
all
his
counsellor
,
he
move
on
with
his
little
force
towards
Calais
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
up
to
the
river
Somme
he
be
unable
to
cross
,
in
consequence
of
the
fort
be
fortify
;
and
,
as
the
English
move
up
the
left
bank
of
the
river
look
for
a
crossing
,
the
French
,
who
have
break
all
the
bridge
,
move
up
the
right
bank
,
watch
them
,
and
wait
to
attack
them
when
they
should
try
to
pass
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
English
find
a
crossing
and
get
safely
over
.
 
<EOS>
the
French
hold
a
council
of
war
at
Rouen
,
resolve
to
give
the
english
battle
,
and
send
herald
to
King
Henry
to
know
by
which
road
he
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
the
road
that
will
take
me
straight
to
Calais
!
"
say
the
King
,
and
send
them
away
with
a
present
of
a
hundred
crown
.
  
<EOS>
the
English
move
on
,
until
they
beheld
the
French
,
and
then
the
King
give
order
to
form
in
line
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
the
French
not
come
on
,
the
army
break
up
after
remain
in
battle
array
till
night
,
and
get
good
rest
and
refreshment
at
a
neighbouring
village
.
 
<EOS>
the
French
be
now
all
lie
in
another
village
,
through
which
they
know
the
English
must
pass
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
resolve
that
the
English
should
begin
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
the
English
have
no
means
of
retreat
,
if
their
King
have
any
such
intention
;
and
so
the
two
army
pass
the
night
,
close
together
.
  
<EOS>
to
understand
these
army
well
,
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
immense
french
army
have
,
among
its
notable
person
,
almost
the
whole
of
that
wicked
nobility
,
whose
debauchery
have
make
France
a
desert
;
and
so
besotted
be
they
by
pride
,
and
by
contempt
for
the
common
people
,
that
they
have
scarcely
any
bowman
(
if
indeed
they
have
any
at
all
)
in
their
whole
enormous
number
:
 
which
,
compare
with
the
english
army
,
be
at
least
as
six
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
proud
fool
have
say
that
the
bow
be
not
a
fit
weapon
for
knightly
hand
,
and
that
France
must
be
defend
by
gentleman
only
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
presently
,
what
hand
the
gentleman
make
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
on
the
english
side
,
among
the
little
force
,
there
be
a
good
proportion
of
man
who
be
not
gentleman
by
any
mean
,
but
who
be
good
stout
archer
for
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
,
in
the
morning
---
have
sleep
little
at
night
,
while
the
French
be
carouse
and
make
sure
of
victory
---
the
King
ride
,
on
a
grey
horse
;
wear
on
his
head
a
helmet
of
shine
steel
,
surmount
by
a
crown
of
gold
,
sparkle
with
precious
stone
;
and
bear
over
his
armour
,
embroider
together
,
the
arm
of
England
and
the
arm
of
France
.
<EOS>
the
archer
look
at
the
shine
helmet
and
the
crown
of
gold
and
the
sparkling
jewel
,
and
admire
them
all
;
but
,
what
they
admire
most
be
the
King
's
cheerful
face
,
and
his
bright
blue
eye
,
as
he
tell
them
that
,
for
himself
,
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
conquer
there
or
to
die
there
,
and
that
England
should
never
have
a
ransom
to
pay
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
brave
knight
who
chance
to
say
that
he
wish
some
of
the
many
gallant
gentleman
and
good
soldier
,
who
be
then
idle
at
home
in
England
,
be
there
to
increase
their
number
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
King
tell
him
that
,
for
his
part
,
he
do
not
wish
for
one
more
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
few
we
have
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
great
will
be
the
honour
we
shall
win
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
man
,
be
now
all
in
good
heart
,
be
refresh
with
bread
and
wine
,
and
hear
prayer
,
and
wait
quietly
for
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
wait
for
the
French
,
because
they
be
draw
up
thirty
deep
<EOS>
(
the
little
english
force
be
only
three
deep
)
,
on
very
difficult
and
heavy
ground
;
and
he
know
that
when
they
move
,
there
must
be
confusion
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
do
not
move
,
he
send
off
two
party
:
---
one
to
lie
conceal
in
a
wood
on
the
left
of
the
French
:
 
the
other
,
to
set
fire
to
some
house
behind
the
French
after
the
battle
should
be
begin
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
scarcely
do
,
when
three
of
the
proud
french
gentleman
,
who
be
to
defend
their
country
without
any
help
from
the
base
peasant
,
come
ride
out
,
call
upon
the
English
to
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
warn
those
gentleman
himself
to
retire
with
all
speed
if
they
care
for
their
life
,
and
order
the
english
banner
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
Sir
Thomas
Erpingham
,
a
great
english
general
,
who
command
the
archer
,
throw
his
truncheon
into
the
air
,
joyfully
,
and
all
the
english
man
,
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
and
bite
it
as
if
they
take
possession
of
the
country
,
rise
up
with
a
great
shout
and
fall
upon
the
French

<EOS>
every
archer

with
a
great
stake
tip
with
iron
;
and
his
order
be
,
to
thrust
this
stake
into
the
ground
,
to
discharge
his
arrow
,
and
then
to
fall
back
,
when
the
french
horseman
come
on
.
<EOS>
as
the
haughty
french
gentleman
,
who
be

break
the
english
archer
and
utterly
destroy
them
with
their
knightly
lance
,
come
ride
up
,
they
be
receive
with
such
a
blind
storm
of
arrow
,
that
they
break
and
turn
.
 
<EOS>
horse
and
man
roll
over
one
another
,
and
the
confusion
be
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
rally
and
charge
the
archer
get
among
the
stake
on
slippery
and
boggy
ground
,
and
be
so
bewilder
that
the
english
archer
---
who
wear
no
armour
,
and
even
take
off
their
leathern
coat
to
be
more
active
---
cut
them
to
piece
,
root
and

.
 
<EOS>
only
three
french

all
this
time
the
dense
french
army

while

english
archer

naked
,
be
as
fresh
and
active
as
if
they
be
fight
on
a
marble
floor
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
the
second
division
of
the
French
come
to
the
relief
of
the
first
,
close
up
in
a
firm
mass
;
the
English

attack
them
;
and
the
deadly

of
the

<EOS>
the

but

King
Henry

over
the
body

.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
come
up
a
band
of
eighteen
french
knight
,
bear
the
banner
of
a
certain
french
lord
,
who
have

<EOS>
one
of
them

him
such
a
blow
with
a
battle

round
him

kill
every
one
of
those
eighteen
knight

and
so

<EOS>
the
french
Duke
of
Alenáon

see
this
,
make
a
desperate
charge
,
and
cut
his
way

to
the
Royal
Standard

<EOS>
He
beat
down
the
Duke
of

and
,
when
the
King
come
to
his
rescue
,
strike
off
a
piece
of
the
crown
he

<EOS>
but

he

honourable
acceptance
of
the
offer

<EOS>
the
death

at
this
time

King
Henry
have
not
be
idle
since
his
victory
of
Agincourt
,
but
have
repulse
a
brave
attempt
of
the
French
to
recover
Harfleur
;
have
gradually
conquer
a
great
part
of
Normandy
;
and
,
at
this
crisis
of
affair
,
take
the
important
town
of
Rouen
,
after
a
siege
of
half
a
year

<EOS>
this
great
loss
so
alarm
the
French
,
that
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
propose
that
a
meeting
to
treat
of
peace
should
be
hold
between
the
French
and
the
english
king
in
a
plain
by
the
river
Seine

<EOS>
on
the
appoint
day
,
King
Henry
appear
there
,
with
his
two
brother
,
Clarence
and
Gloucester
,
and
a
thousand
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
french
King
,
be
more
mad
than
usual
that
day
,
could
not
come
;
but
the
Queen
come
,
and
with
her
the
Princess
Catherine
:
who
be
a
very
lovely
creature
,
and
who
make
a
real
impression
on
King
Henry
,
now
that
he
see
her
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
most
important
circumstance
that
arise
out
of
the
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
as
if
it
be
impossible
for
a
french
nobleman
of
that
time
to
be
true
to
his
word
of
honour
in
anything
,
Henry
discover
that
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
be
,
at
that
very
moment
,
in
secret
treaty
with
the
Dauphin
;
and
he
therefore
abandon
the
negotiation
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
and
the
Dauphin
,
each
of
whom
with
the
good
reason
distrust
the
other
as
a
noble
ruffian
surround
by
a
party
of
noble
ruffian
,
be
rather
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
after
this
;
but
,
at
length
they
agree
to
meet
,
on
a
bridge
over
the
river
Yonne
,
where
it
be
arrange
that
there
should
be
two
strong
gate
put
up
,
with
an
empty
space
between
them
;
and
that
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
should
come
into
that
space
by
one
gate
,
with
ten
man
only
;
and
that
the
Dauphin
should
come
into
that
space
by
the
other
gate
,
also
with
ten
man
,
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
the
Dauphin
keep
his
word
,
but
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
be
on
his
knee
before
him
in
the
act
of
speak
,
one
of
the
Dauphin
's
noble
ruffian
cut
the
say
duke
down
with
a
small
axe
,
and
other
speedily
finish
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
the
Dauphin
to
pretend
that
this
base
murder
be
not
do
with
his
consent
;
it
be
too
bad
,
even
for
France
,
and
cause
a
general
horror
.
 
<EOS>
the
duke
's
heir
hasten
to
make
a
treaty
with
King
Henry
,
and
the
French
Queen
engage
that
her
husband
should
consent
to
it
,
whatever
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
make
peace
,
on
condition
of
receive
the
Princess
Catherine
in
marriage
,
and
be
make
regent
of
France
during
the
rest
of
the
King
's
lifetime
,
and
succeed
to
the
french
crown
at
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
soon
marry
to
the
beautiful
Princess
,
and
take
her
proudly
home
to
England
,
where
she
be
crown
with
great
honour
and
glory
.
  
<EOS>
this
peace
be
call
the
Perpetual
Peace
;
we
shall
soon
see
how
long
it
last
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
great
satisfaction
to
the
french
people
,
although
they
be
so
poor
and
miserable
,
that
,
at
the
time
of
the
celebration
of
the
royal
marriage
,
number
of
them
be
die
with
starvation
,
on
the
dunghill
in
the
street
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
Dauphin
in
some
few
part
of
France
,
but
King
Henry
beat
it
all
down
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
with
his
great
possession
in
France
secure
,
and
<EOS>
his
beautiful
wife
to
cheer
him
,
and
a
son
bear
to
give
him
great
happiness
,
all
appear
bright
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
fulness
of
his
triumph
and
the
height
of
his
power
,
Death
come
upon
him
,
and
his
day
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
fall
ill
at
Vincennes
,
and
find
that
he
could
not
recover
,
he
be
very
calm
and
quiet
,
and
speak
serenely
to
those
who
weep
around
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
and
child
,
he
say
,
he
leave
to
the
loving
care
of
his
brother
the
Duke
of
Bedford
,
and
his
other
faithful
noble
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
them
his
advice
that
England
should
establish
a
friendship
with
the
new
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
and
offer
him
the
regency
of
France
;
that
it
should
not
set
free
the
royal
prince
who
have
be
take
at
Agincourt
;
and
that
,
whatever
quarrel
may
arise
with
France
,
England
should
never
make
peace
without
hold
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
lay
down
his
head
,
and
ask
the
attendant
priest
to
chant
the
penitential
psalm
.
 
<EOS>
amid
which
solemn
sound

on

the
tenth

his
reign

King
Henry

Fifth

away
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
<EOS>
and
mournfully
they
carry
his
embalm
body
in
a
procession
of
great
state
to
Paris
,
and
thence
to
rouen
where
his
Queen

from
whom
the
sad
intelligence
of
his
death
be

Thence

at

<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Sixth
Part
<EOS>
the
first
    
it
have
be
the
wish

the
late
King

that
while

KING
HENRY
the
SIXTH
,
at
this
time
only
nine
month
old

be
under
age

the
Duke

be
appoint
Regent

<EOS>
the
English
Parliament

however

prefer
to
appoint
a
Council
of
Regency
,
with
the
Duke
of
Bedford
at
its
head
:
 
to
be
represent
,
in
his
absence
only
,
by
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
would
seem
to
have
be
wise
in
this
,
for
Gloucester
soon
show
himself
to
be
ambitious
and
troublesome
,
and
,
in
the
gratification
of
his
own
personal
scheme
,
give
dangerous
offence
to
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
which
be
with
difficulty
adjust
.
  
<EOS>
as
that
duke
decline
the
Regency
of
France
,
it
be
bestow
by
the
poor
french
King
upon
the
Duke
of
Bedford
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
french
King
die
within
two
month
,
the
Dauphin
instantly
assert
his
claim
to
the
french
throne
,
and
be
actually
crown
under
the
title
of
CHARLES
the
SEVENTH

<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Bedford
,
to
be
a
match
for
him
,
enter
into
a
friendly
league
with
the
Dukes
of
Burgundy
and
Brittany
,
and
give
them
his
two
sister
in
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
War
with
France
be
immediately
renew

the
Perpetual

come

an
untimely
end

<EOS>
in
the
first
campaign

the
English
,
aid
by
this
alliance
,
be
speedily
successful

<EOS>
as
Scotland
,
however
,
have
send
the
french
five
thousand
man
,
and
may
send
more
,
or
attack
the
North
of
England
while
England
be
busy
with
France
,
it
be
consider
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
offer
the
scottish
King
,
James
,
who
have
be
so
long
imprison
,
his
liberty
,
on
his
pay
forty
thousand
pound
for
his
board
and
lodging
during
nineteen
year

and
engage
to
forbid
his
subject
from
serve
under
the
flag
of
France

<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
know
,
not
only
that
the
amiable
captive
at
last
regain
his
freedom
upon
these
term

but
,
that
he
marry
a
noble
english
lady
,
with
whom
he
have
be
long
in
love
,
and
become
an
excellent
King

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
we
have
meet
with
some
king
in
this
history
,
and
shall
meet
with
some
more
,
who
would
have
be
very
much
the
well
,
and
would
have
leave
the
world
much
happy
,
if
they
have
be
imprison
nineteen
year
too

<EOS>
in
the
second
campaign
,
the
English
gain
a
considerable
victory
at
Verneuil
,
in
a
battle
which
be
chiefly
remarkable
,
otherwise
,
for
their
resort
to
the
odd
expedient
of
tie
their
baggage
-
horse
together
by
the
head
and
tail
,
and
jumble
them
up
with
the
baggage
,
so
as
to
convert
them
into
a
sort
of
live
fortification
---
which
be
find
useful
to
the
troop
,
but
which
I
should
think
be
not
agreeable
to
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
for
three
year
afterwards
very
little
be
do

owe
to
both
side
be
too
poor

Paris

in
which
it

decide

lay
siege

him
,
come
victorious
out
of
a
hot
skirmish
,
which
be
afterwards
call
in
jest
the
Battle
of
the
Herrings
)
<EOS>
the
town
of
Orleans
be
so
completely
hem
in
,
that
the
besiege
propose
to
yield
it
up
to
their
countryman
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
the
english
general
,
however
,
reply
that
his
english
man
have
win
it
,
so
far
,
by
their
blood
and
valour
,
and
that
his
english
man
must
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
no
hope
for
the
town
,
or
for
the
Dauphin
,
who
be
so
dismayed
that
he
even
think
of
fly
to
Scotland
or
to
Spain
---
when
a
peasant
girl
rise
up
and
change
the
whole
state
of
affair
.
  
<EOS>
the
story
of
this
peasant
girl
I
have
now
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
part
<EOS>
the
second
:
 
<EOS>
the
Story
of
Joan
of
Arc
    
in
a
remote
village
among
some
wild
hill
in
the
province
of
Lorraine
<EOS>
,
there
live
a
countryman
whose
name
be
JACQUES
D'ARC
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
daughter
,
JOAN
OF
ARC
,
who
be
at
this
time
in
her
twentieth
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
solitary
girl
from
her
childhood
;
she
have
often
tend
sheep
and
cattle
for
whole
day
where
no
human
figure
be
see
or
human
voice
hear
;
and
she
have
often
kneel
,
for
hour
together
,
in
the
gloomy
,
empty
,
little
village
chapel
,
look
up
at
the
altar
and
at
the
dim
lamp
burn
before
it
,
until
she
fancy
that
she
see
shadowy
figure
stand
there
,
and
even
that
she
hear
them
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
in
that
part
of
France
be
very
ignorant
and
superstitious
,
and
they
have
many
ghostly
tale
to
tell
about
what
they
have
dream
,
and
what
they
see
among
the
lonely
hill
when
the
cloud
and
the
mist
be
rest
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
easily
believe
that
Joan
see
strange
sight
,
and
they
whisper
among
themselves
that
angel
and
spirit
talk
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
Joan
tell
her
father
that
she
have
one
day
be
surprise
by
a
great
unearthly
light
,
and
have
afterwards
hear
a
solemn
voice
,
which
say
it
be
Saint
Michael
's
voice
,
tell
her
that
she
be
to
go
and
help
the
Dauphin
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
this
(
she
say
)
,
Saint
Catherine
and
Saint
Margaret
have
appear
to
her
with
sparkling
crown
upon
their
head
,
and
have
encourage
her
to
be
virtuous
and
resolute
.
 
<EOS>
these
vision
have
return
sometimes
;
but
the
voice
very
often
;
and
the
voice
always
say
,
"
Joan
,
thou
art
appoint
by
Heaven
to
go
and
help
the
Dauphin
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
almost
always
hear
them
while
the
chapel
bell
be
ring
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
,
now
,
that
Joan
believe
she
see
and
hear
these
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
know
that
such
delusion
be
a
disease
which
be
not
by
any
mean
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
enough
that
there
be
figure
of
Saint
Michael
,
and
Saint
Catherine
,
and
Saint
Margaret
,
in
the
little
chapel
(
where
they
would
be
very
likely
to
have
shine
crown
upon
their
head
)
,
and
that
they
first
give
Joan
the
idea
of
those
three
personage
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
long
be
a
moping
,
fanciful
girl
,
and
,
though
she
be
a
very
good
girl
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
she
be
a
little
vain
,
and
wishful
for
notoriety
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
,
something
wise
than
his
neighbour
,
say
,
"
I
tell
thee
,
Joan
,
it
be
thy
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hadst
better
have
a
kind
husband
to
take
care
of
thee
,
girl
,
and
work
to
employ
thy
mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
Joan
tell
him
in
reply
,
that
she
have
take
a
vow
never
to
have
a
husband
,
and
that
she
must
go
as
Heaven
direct
her
,
to
help
the
Dauphin
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
,
unfortunately
for
her
father
's
persuasion
,
and
most
unfortunately
for
the
poor
girl
,
too
,
that
a
party
of
the
Dauphin
's
enemy
find
their
way
into
the
village
while
Joan
's
disorder
be
at
this
point
,
and
burn
the
chapel
,
and
drive
out
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
the
cruelty
she
see
commit
,
touch
Joan
's
heart
and
make
her
bad
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
that
the
voice
and
the
figure
be
now
continually
with
her
;
that
they
tell
her
she
be
the
girl
who
,
accord
to
an
old
prophecy
,
be
to
deliver
France
;
and
she
must
go
and
help
the
Dauphin
,
and
must
remain
with
him
until
he
should
be
crown
at
Rheims
:
 
and
that
she
must
travel
a
long
way
to
a
certain
lord
name
BAUDRICOURT
,
who
could
and
would
,
bring
her
into
the
Dauphin
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
as
her
father
still
say
,
"
I
tell
thee
,
Joan
,
it
be
thy
fancy
,
"
she
set
off
to
find
out
this
lord
,
accompany
by
an
uncle
,
a
poor
village
wheelwright
and
cart
-
maker
,
who
believe
in
the
reality
of
her
vision
.
 
<EOS>
They
travel
a
long
way
and
go
on
and
on
,
over
a
rough
country
,
full
of
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
's
man
,
and
of
all
kind
of
robber
and
marauder
,
until
they
come
to
where
this
lord
be
.
  
<EOS>
when
his
servant
tell
him
that
there
be
a
poor
peasant
girl
name
Joan
of
Arc
,
accompany
by
nobody
but
an
old
village
wheelwright
and
cart
-
maker
,
who
wish
to
see
him
because
she
be
command
to
help
the
Dauphin
and
save
France
,
Baudricourt
burst
out
a
-
laughing
,
and
bade
them
send
the
girl
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
soon
hear
so
much
about
her
linger
in
the
town
,
and
pray
in
the
church
,
and
see
vision
,
and
do
harm
to
no
one
,
that
he
send
for
her
,
and
question
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
say
the
same
thing
after
she
have
be
well
sprinkle
with
holy
water
as
she
have
say
before
the
sprinkling
,
Baudricourt
begin
to
think
there
may
be
something
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
he
think
it
worth
while
to
send
her
on
to
the
town
of
Chinon
,
where
the
Dauphin
be
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
buy
her
a
horse
,
and
a
sword
,
and
give
her
two
squire
to
conduct
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
Voices
have
tell
Joan
that
she
be
to
wear
a
man
's
dress
,
now
,
she
put
one
on
,
and
gird
her
sword
to
her
side
,
and
bind
spur
to
her
heel
,
and
mount
her
horse
and
ride
away
with
her
two
squire
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
her
uncle
the
wheelwright
,
he
stand
stare
at
his
niece
in
wonder
until
she
be
out
of
sight
---
<EOS>
as
well
he
may
---
and
then
go
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
place
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
Joan
and
her
two
squire
ride
on
and
on
,
until
they
come
to
Chinon
,
where
she
be
,
after
some
doubt
,
<EOS>
admit
into
the
Dauphin
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
pick
him
out
immediately
from
all
his
court
,
she
tell
him
that
she
come
command
by
Heaven
to
subdue
his
enemy
and
conduct
him
to
his
coronation
at
Rheims
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
tell
him
(
or
he
pretend
so
afterwards
,
to
make
the
great
impression
upon
his
soldier
)
<EOS>
a
number
of
his
secret
know
only
to
himself
,
and
<EOS>
,
furthermore
,
she
say
there
be
an
old
,
old
sword
in
the
cathedral
of
Saint
Catherine
at
Fierbois
,
mark
with
five
old
crosse
on
the
blade
,
which
Saint
Catherine
have
order
her
to
wear
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
nobody
know
anything
about
this
old
,
old
sword
,
but
when
the
cathedral
come
to
be
examine
---
which
be
immediately
do
---
there
,
sure
enough
,
the
sword
be
find
!
 
<EOS>
the
Dauphin
then
require
a
number
of
grave
priest
and
bishop
to
give
him
their
opinion
whether
the
girl
derive
her
power
from
good
spirit
or
from
evil
spirit
,
which
they
hold
prodigiously
long
debate
about
,
in
the
course
of
which
several
learn
man
fall
fast
asleep
and
snore
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
one
gruff
old
gentleman
have
say
to
Joan
,
"
what
language
do
your
voice
speak
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
Joan
have
reply
to
the
gruff
old
gentleman
,
"
a
pleasanter
language
than
yours
,
"
they
agree
that
it
be
all
correct
,
and
that
Joan
of
Arc
be
inspire
from
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
this
wonderful
circumstance
put
new
heart
into
the
Dauphin
's
soldier
when
they
hear
of
it
,
and
dispirit
the
english
army
,
who
take
Joan
for
a
witch
.
  
<EOS>
so
Joan
mount
horse
again
,
and
again
ride
on
and
on
,
until
she
come
to
Orleans
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
ride
now
,
as
never
peasant
girl
have
ride
yet
.
 
<EOS>
She
ride
upon
a
white
war
-
horse
,
in
a
suit
of
glitter
armour
;
<EOS>
with
the
old
,
old
sword
from
the
cathedral
,
newly
burnish
,
in
her
belt
;
with
a
white
flag
carry
before
her
,
upon
which
be
a
picture
of
God
,
and
the
word
JESUS
MARIA
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
splendid
state
,
at
the
head
of
a
great
body
of
troop
escort
provision
of
all
kind
for
the
starve
inhabitant
of
Orleans
,
she
appear
before
that
beleaguer
city
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
people
on
the
wall
beheld
her
,
they
cry
out
"
<EOS>
the
Maid
be
come
!
 
<EOS>
the
Maid
of
the
Prophecy
be
come
to
deliver
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
this
,
and
the
sight
of
the
Maid
fighting
at
the
head
of
their
man
,
make
the
French
so
bold
,
and
make
the
English
so
fearful
,
that
the
english
line
of
fort
be
soon
break
,
the
troop
and
provision
be
get
into
the
town
,
and
Orleans
be
save
.
  
<EOS>
Joan
,
henceforth
call
the
MAID
of
ORLEANS
,
remain
within
the
wall
for
a
few
day
,
and
cause
letter
to
be
throw
over
,
order
Lord
Suffolk
and
his
englishman
to
depart
from
before
the
town
accord
to
the
will
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
english
general
very
positively
decline
to
believe
that
Joan
know
anything
about
the
will
of
Heaven
(
which
do
not
mend
the
matter
with
his
soldier
,
for
they
stupidly
say
if
she
be
not
inspire
she
be
a
witch
,
and
it
be
of
no
use
to
fight
against
a
witch
)
,
she
mount
her
white
war
-
horse
again
,
and
order
her
white
banner
to
advance
.
  
<EOS>
the
besieger
hold
the
bridge
,
and
some
strong
tower
upon
the
bridge
;
and
here
the
Maid
of
Orleans
attack
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
fight
be
fourteen
hour
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
plant
a
scaling
ladder
with
her
own
hand
,
and
mount
a
tower
wall
,
but
be
strike
by
an
english
arrow
in
the
neck
,
and
fall
into
the
trench
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
carry
away
and
the
arrow
be
take
out
,
during
which
operation
she
scream
and
cry
with
the
pain
,
as
any
other
girl
may
have
do
;
but
presently
she
say
that
the
Voices
be
speak
to
her
and
soothe
her
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
she
get
up
,
and
be
again
foremost
in
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
English
who
have
see
her
fall
and
suppose
her
dead
,
see
this
,
they
be
trouble
with
the
strange
fear
,
and
some
of
them
cry
out
that
they
beheld
Saint
Michael
on
a
white
horse
(
probably
Joan
herself
)
fight
for
the
French
.
<EOS>
They
lose
the
bridge
,
and
lose
the
tower
,
and
next
day
set
their
chain
of
fort
on
fire
,
and
leave
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
Lord
Suffolk
himself
retire
no
farther
than
the
town
of
Jargeau
,
which
be
only
a
few
mile
off
,
the
Maid
of
Orleans
besiege
him
there
,
and
he
be
take
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
white
banner
scale
the
wall
,
she
be
strike
upon
the
head
with
a
stone
,
and
be
again
tumble
down
into
the
ditch
;
but
,
she
only
cry
all
the
more
,
as
she
lie
there
,
"
on
,
on
,
my
countryman
!
 
<EOS>
and
fear
nothing
,
for
the
Lord
hath
deliver
them
into
our
hand
!
"
 
<EOS>
after
this
new
success
of
the
Maid
's
,
several
other
fortress
and
place
which
have
previously
hold
out
against
the
Dauphin
be
deliver
up
without
a
battle
;
and
at
Patay
she
defeat
the
remainder
of
the
english
army
,
and
set
up
her
victorious
white
banner
on
a
field
where
twelve
hundred
Englishmen
lie
dead
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
urge
the
Dauphin
(
who
always
keep
out
of
the
way
when
there
be
any
fighting
)
to
proceed
to
Rheims
,
as
the
first
part
of
her
mission
be
accomplish
;
and
to
complete
the
whole
by
be
crown
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dauphin
be
in
no
particular
hurry
to
do
this
,
as
Rheims
be
a
long
way
off
,
and
the
English
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
be
still
strong
in
the
country
through
which
the
road
lie
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
set
forth
,
with
ten
thousand
man
,
and
again
the
Maid
of
Orleans
ride
on
and
on
,
upon
her
white
war
-
horse
,
and
in
her
shine
armour
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
they
come
to
a
town
which
yield
readily
,
the
soldier
believe
in
her
;
but
,
whenever
they
come
to
a
town
which
give
them
any
trouble
,
they
begin
to
murmur
that
she
be
an
impostor
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
be
particularly
the
case
at
Troyes
,
which
finally
yield
,
however
,
through
the
persuasion
of
one
Richard
,
a
friar
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Friar
Richard
be
in
the
old
doubt
about
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
until
he
have
sprinkle
her
well
with
holy
water
,
and
have
also
well
sprinkle
the
threshold
of
the
gate
by
which
she
come
into
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
it
make
no
change
in
her
or
the
gate
,
he
say
,
as
the
other
grave
old
gentleman
have
say
,
that
it
be
all
right
,
and
become
her
great
ally
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
at
last
,
by
dint
of
ride
on
and
on
,
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
and
the
Dauphin
,
and
the
ten
thousand
sometimes
believe
and
sometimes
unbelieve
man
,
come
to
Rheims
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
great
cathedral
of
Rheims
,
the
Dauphin
actually
be
crown
Charles
the
Seventh
in
a
great
assembly
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
Maid
,
who
with
her
white
banner
stand
beside
the
King
in
that
hour
of
his
triumph
,
kneel
down
upon
the
pavement
at
his
foot
,
and
say
,
with
tear
,
that
what
she
have
be
inspire
to
do
,
be
do
,
and
that
the
only
recompense
she
ask
for
,
be
,
that
she
should
now
have
leave
to
go
back
to
her
distant
home
,
and
her
sturdily
incredulous
father
,
and
her
first
simple
escort
the
village
wheelwright
and
cart
-
maker
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
king
say
"
no
!
"
and
make
her
and
her
family
as
noble
as
a
King
could
,
and
settle
upon
her
the
income
of
a
Count
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
happy
<EOS>
have
it
be
for
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
if
she
have
resume
her
rustic
dress
that
day
,
and
have
go
home
to
the
little
chapel
and
the
wild
hill
,
and
have
forget
all
these
thing
,
and
have
be
a
good
man
's
wife
,
and
have
hear
no
strange
voice
than
the
voice
of
little
child
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
,
and
she
continue
help
the
King
<EOS>
(
she
do
a
world
for
him
,
in
alliance
with
Friar
Richard
)
,
and
try
to
improve
the
life
of
the
coarse
soldier
,
and
lead
a
religious
,
an
unselfish
,
and
a
modest
life
,
herself
,
beyond
any
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
many
time
she
pray
the
King
to
let
her
go
home
;
and
once
she
even
take
off
her
bright
armour
and
hang
it
up
in
a
church
,
mean
never
to
wear
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
King
always
win
her
back
again
---
while
she
be
of
any
use
to
him
---
and
so
she
go
on
and
on
and
on
,
to
her
doom
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Duke
of
Bedford
,
who
be
a
very
able
man
,
begin
to
be
active
for
England
,
and
,
by
bring
the
war
back
into
France
and
by
hold
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
to
his
faith
,
to
distress
and
disturb
Charles
very
much
,
Charles
sometimes
ask
the
Maid
of
Orleans
what
the
Voices
say
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
Voices
have
become
(
very
like
ordinary
voice
in
perplex
time
)
contradictory
and
confused
,
so
that
now
they
say
one
thing
,
and
now
say
another
,
and
the
Maid
lose
credit
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
march
on
Paris
,
which
be
oppose
to
him
,
and
attack
the
suburb
of
Saint
Honore
.
<EOS>
in
this
fight
,
be
again
strike
down
into
the
ditch
,
she
be
abandon
by
the
whole
army
.
 
<EOS>
She
lie
unaided
among
a
heap
of
dead
,
and
crawl
out
how
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
some
of
her
believer
go
over
to
an
opposition
Maid
,
Catherine
of
La
Rochelle
,
who
say
she
be
inspire
to
tell
where
there
be
treasure
of
bury
money
---
though
she
never
do
---
and
then
Joan
accidentally
break
the
old
,
old
sword
,
and
other
say
that
her
power
be
break
with
it
.
<EOS>
finally
,
at
the
siege
of
Compiägne
,
hold
by
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
where
she
do
valiant
service
,
she
be
basely
leave
alone
in
a
retreat
,
though
face
about
and
fight
to
the
last
;
and
an
archer
pull
her
off
her
horse
.
  
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
the
uproar
that
be
make
,
and
the
thanksgiving
that
be
sing
,
about
the
capture
of
this
one
poor
country
-
girl
!
 
<EOS>
o
the
way
in
which
she
be
demand
to
be
try
for
sorcery
and
heresy
,
and
anything
else
you
like
,
by
the
Inquisitor
-
General
of
France
,
and
by
this
great
man
,
and
by
that
great
man
,
until
it
be
wearisome
to
think
of
!
<EOS>
She
be
buy
at
last
by
the
Bishop
of
Beauvais
for
ten
thousand
franc
,
and
be
shut
up
in
her
narrow
prison
:
 
plain
Joan
of
Arc
again
,
and
Maid
of
Orleans
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
do
if
I
be
to
tell
you
how
they
have
Joan
out
to
examine
her
,
and
cross
-
examine
her
,
and
re
-
examine
her
,
and
worry
her
into
say
anything
and
everything
;
and
how
all
sort
of
scholar
and
doctor
bestow
their
utmost
tediousness
upon
her
.
<EOS>
sixteen
time
she
be
bring
out
and
shut
up
again
,
and
worried
,
and
entrap
,
and
argue
with
,
until
she
be
heart
-
sick
of
the
dreary
business
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
last
occasion
of
this
kind
she
be
bring
into
a
burial
-
place
at
Rouen
,
dismally
decorate
with
a
scaffold
,
and
a
stake
and
faggot
,
and
the
executioner
,
and
a
pulpit
with
a
friar
therein
,
and
an
awful
sermon
ready
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
affect
to
know
that
even
at
that
pass
the
poor
girl
honour
the
mean
vermin
of
a
King
,
who
have
so
use
her
for
his
purpose
and
so
abandon
her
;
and
,
that
while
she
have
be
regardless
of
reproach
heap
upon
herself
,
she
speak
out
courageously
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
natural
in
one
so
young
to
hold
to
life
.
 
<EOS>
to
save
her
life
,
she
sign
a
declaration
prepare
for
her
---
sign
it
with
a
cross
,
for
she
could
not
write
---
that
all
her
vision
and
voice
have
come
from
the
Devil
.
 
<EOS>
upon
her
recant
the
past
,
and
protest
that
she
would
never
wear
a
man
's
dress
in
future
,
she
be
condemn
to
imprisonment
for
life
,
"
on
the
bread
of
sorrow
and
the
water
of
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
bread
of
sorrow
and
the
water
of
affliction
,
the
vision
and
the
Voices
soon
return
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
natural
that
they
should
do
so
,
for
that
kind
of
disease
be
much
aggravate
by
fast
,
loneliness
,
and
anxiety
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
get
out
of
Joan
that
she
consider
herself
inspire
again
,
but
,
she
be
take
in
a
man
's
dress
,
which
have
be
leave
---
to
entrap
her
---
in
her
prison
,
and
which
she
put
on
,
in
her
solitude
;
perhaps
,
in
remembrance
of
her
past
glory
,
perhaps
,
because
the
imaginary
Voices
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
relapse
into
the
sorcery
and
heresy
and
anything
else
you
like
,
she
be
sentence
to
be
burn
to
death
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
the
market
-
place
of
Rouen
,
in
the
hideous
dress
which
the
monk
have
invent
for
such
spectacle
;
with
priest
and
bishop
sit
in
a
gallery
look
on
,
though
some
have
the
christian
grace
to
go
away
,
unable
to
endure
the
infamous
scene
;
this
shriek
girl
---
last
see
amidst
the
smoke
and
fire
,
hold
a
crucifix
between
her
hand
;
last
hear
,
call
upon
Christ
---
be
burn
to
ashe
.
 
<EOS>
They
throw
her
ashe
into
the
river
seine
;
but
they
will
rise
against
her
murderer
on
the
last
day
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
moment
of
her
capture
,
neither
the
french
King
nor
one
single
man
in
all
his
court
raise
a
finger
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
defence
of
them
that
they
may
have
never
really
believe
in
her
,
or
that
they
may
have
win
her
victory
by
their
skill
and
bravery
.
<EOS>
the
more
they
pretend
to
believe
in
her
,
the
more
they
have
cause
her
to
believe
in
herself
;
and
she
have
ever
be
true
to
them
,
ever
brave
,
ever
nobly
devoted
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
no
wonder
,
that
they
,
who
be
in
all
thing
false
to
themselves
,
false
to
one
another
,
false
to
their
country
,
false
to
Heaven
,
false
to
Earth
,
should
be
monster
of
ingratitude
and
treachery
to
a
helpless
peasant
girl
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
picturesque
old
town
of
Rouen
,
where
weed
and
grass
grow
high
on
the
cathedral
tower
,
and
the
venerable
Norman
street
be
still
warm
in
the
blessed
sunlight
though
the
monkish
fire
that
once
gleam
horribly
upon
them
have
long
grow
cold
,
there
be
a
statue
of
Joan
of
Arc
,
in
the
scene
of
her
last
agony
,
the
square
to
which
she
have
give
its
present
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
some
statue
of
modern
time
---
even
in
the
World
's
metropolis
,
I
think
---
which
commemorate
less
constancy
,
less
earnestness
,
small
claim
upon
the
world
's
attention
,
and
much
great
impostor
.
  
<EOS>
part
the
third
    
bad
deed
seldom
prosper
,
happily
for
mankind
;
and
the
English
cause
gain
no
advantage
from
the
cruel
death
of
Joan
of
Arc
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
,
the
war
go
heavily
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Bedford
die
;
the
alliance
with
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
be
break
;
and
Lord
Talbot
become
a
great
general
on
the
english
side
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
two
of
the
consequence
of
war
be
,
Famine
---
because
the
people
can
not
peacefully
cultivate
the
ground
---
and
Pestilence
,
which
come
of
want
,
misery
,
and
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
both
these
horror
break
out
in
both
country
,
and
last
for
two
wretched
year
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
war
go
on
again
,
and
come
by
slow
degree
to
be
so
badly
conduct
by
the
english
government
,
that
,
within
twenty
year
from
the
execution
of
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
of
all
the
great
french
conquest
,
the
town
of
Calais
alone
remain
in
english
hand
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
victory
and
defeat
be
take
place
in
the
course
of
time
,
many
strange
thing
happen
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
King
,
as
he
grow
up
,
prove
to
be
very
unlike
his
great
father
,
and
show
himself
a
miserable
puny
creature
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
harm
in
him
---
he
have
a
great
aversion
to
shed
blood
:
 
which
be
something
---
but
,
he
be
a
weak
,
silly
,
helpless
young
man
,
and
a
mere
shuttlecock
to
the
great
lordly
battledore
about
the
Court
.
  
<EOS>
of
these
battledore
,
Cardinal
Beaufort
,
a
relation
of
the
King
,
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
be
at
first
the
most
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
have
a
wife
,
who
be
nonsensically
accuse
of
practise
witchcraft
to
cause
the
King
's
death
and
lead
to
her
husband
be
come
to
the
throne
,
he
be
the
next
heir
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
charge
with
have
,
by
the
help
of
a
ridiculous
old
woman
name
Margery
(
who
be
call
a
witch
)
<EOS>
,
make
a
little
waxen
doll
in
the
King
's
likeness
,
and
put
it
before
a
slow
fire
that
it
may
gradually
melt
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
,
in
such
case
,
that
the
death
of
the
person
whom
the
doll
be
make
to
represent
,
be
sure
to
happen
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
duchess
be
as
ignorant
as
the
rest
of
them
,
and
really
do
make
such
a
doll
with
such
an
intention
,
I
do
not
know
;
<EOS>
but
,
you
and
I
know
very
well
that
she
may
have
make
a
thousand
doll
,
if
she
have
be
stupid
enough
,
and
may
have
melt
them
all
,
without
hurt
the
King
or
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
be
try
for
it
,
and
so
be
old
Margery
,
and
so
be
one
of
the
duke
's
chaplain
,
who
be
charge
with
have
assist
them
.
 
<EOS>
both
he
and
Margery
be
put
to
death
,
and
the
duchess
,
after
be
take
on
foot
and
bear
a
light
candle
,
three
time
round
the
City
,
as
a
penance
,
be
imprison
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
duke
,
himself
,
take
all
this
pretty
quietly
,
and
make
as
little
stir
about
the
matter
as
if
he
be
rather
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
duchess
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
he
be
not
destine
to
keep
himself
out
of
trouble
long
.
 
<EOS>
the
royal
shuttlecock
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
the
battledore
be
very
anxious
to
get
him
married
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
want
him
to
marry
a
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Armagnac
;
but
,
the
Cardinal
and
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
be
all
for
MARGARET
,
the
daughter
of
the
King
of
Sicily
,
who
they
know
be
a
resolute
,
ambitious
woman
and
would
govern
the
king
as
she
choose
.
 
<EOS>
to
make
friend
with
this
lady
,
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
,
who
go
over
to
arrange
the
match
,
consent
to
accept
her
for
the
King
's
wife
without
any
fortune
,
and
even
to
give
up
the
two
most
valuable
possession
England
then
have
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
marriage
be
arrange
,
on
term
very
advantageous
to
the
lady
;
and
Lord
Suffolk
bring
her
to
England
,
and
she
be
marry
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
on
what
pretence
this
queen
and
her
party
charge
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
with
high
treason
within
a
couple
of
year
,
it
be
impossible
to
make
out
,
the
matter
be
so
confused
;
but
,
they
pretend
that
the
King
's
life
be
in
danger
,
and
they
take
the
duke
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
a
fortnight
afterwards
,
he
be
find
dead
in
bed
(
they
say
)
,
and
his
body
be
show
to
the
people
,
and
Lord
Suffolk
come
in
for
the
good
part
of
his
estate
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
by
this
time
how
strangely
liable
state
prisoner
be
to
sudden
death
.
  
<EOS>
if
Cardinal
Beaufort
have
any
hand
in
this
matter
,
it
do
him
<EOS>
no
good
,
for
he
die
within
six
week
;
think
it
very
hard
and
curious
---
at
eighty
year
old
!
---
that
he
could
not
live
to
be
Pope
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
time
when
England
have
complete
her
loss
of
all
her
great
french
conquest
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
charge
the
loss
principally
upon
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
,
now
a
duke
,
who
have
make
those
easy
term
about
the
Royal
Marriage
,
and
who
,
they
believe
,
have
even
be
buy
by
France
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
impeach
as
a
traitor
,
on
a
great
number
of
charge
,
but
chiefly
on
accusation
of
have
aid
the
french
King
,
and
of
design
to
make
his
own
son
King
of
England
.
<EOS>
the
Commons
and
the
people
be
violent
against
him
,
the
King
be
make
(
by
his
friend
)
to
interpose
to
save
him
,
by
banish
him
for
five
year
,
and
prorogue
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
the
duke
have
much
ado
to
escape
from
a
London
mob
,
two
thousand
strong
,
who
lie
in
wait
for
him
in
St
Giles
's
field
;
but
,
he
get
down
to
his
own
estate
in
Suffolk

He

then

and
there

then

where

by

,
have

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
there
now
arise
in
Kent
an
Irishman
,
who
give
himself
the
name
of
Mortimer
,
but
whose
real
name
be
JACK
CADE
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
in
imitation
of
Wat
Tyler
,
though
he
be
a
very
different
and
inferior
sort
of
man
,
address
the
kentish
man
upon
their
wrong
,
occasion
by
the
bad
government
of
England
,
among
so
many
battledore
and
such
a
poor
shuttlecock
;
and
the
kentish
man
rise
up
to
the
number
of
twenty
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
Their
place
of
assembly
be
Blackheath
,
where
,
head
by
Jack
,
they
put
forth
two
paper
,
which
they
call
"
the
complaint
of
the
Commons
of
Kent
,
"
and
"
the
Requests
of
the
Captain
of
the
Great
Assembly
in
Kent
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
retire
to
Sevenoaks
.
 
<EOS>
the
royal
army
come
up
with
them
here
,
they
beat
it
and
kill
their
general
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
Jack
dress
himself
in
the
dead
general
's
armour
,
and
lead
his
man
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
pass
into
the
City
from
Southwark
,
over
the
bridge
,
and
enter
it
in
triumph
,
give
the
strict
order
to
his
man
not
to
plunder
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
a
show
of
his
force
there
,
while
the
citizen
look
on
quietly
,
he
go
back
into
Southwark
in
good
order
,
and
pass
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
he
come
back
again
,
have
get
hold
in
the
meantime
of
Lord
Say
,
an
unpopular
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
say
Jack
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
judge
:
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
so
good
as
to
make
a
tribunal
in
Guildhall
,
and
try
me
this
nobleman
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
court
be
hastily
make
,
he
be
find
guilty
,
and
Jack
and
his
man
cut
his
head
off
on
Cornhill
.
 
<EOS>
They
also
cut
off
the
head
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
then
go
back
in
good
order
to
Southwark
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
although
the
citizen
could
bear
the
beheading
of
an
unpopular
lord
,
they
could
not
bear
to
have
their
house
pillage
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
do
so
happen
that
Jack
,
after
dinner
---
perhaps
he
have
drunk
a
little
too
much
---
begin
to
plunder
the
house
where
he
lodge
;
upon
which
,
of
course
,
his
man
begin
to
imitate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
the
Londoners
take
counsel
with
Lord
Scales
,
who
have
a
thousand
soldier
in
the
Tower
;
and
defend
London
Bridge
,
and
keep
Jack
and
his
people
out
.
 
<EOS>
this
advantage
gain
,
it
be
resolve
by
diver
great
man
to
divide
Jack
's
army
in
the
old
way
,
by
make
a
great
many
promise
on
behalf
of
the
state
,
that
be
never
intend
to
be
perform
.
 
<EOS>
this
DID
divide
them
;
some
of
Jack
's
man
say
that
they
ought
to
take
the
condition
which
be
offer
,
and
other
say
that
they
ought
not
,
for
they
be
only
a
snare
;
some
go
home
at
once
;
other
stay
where
they
be
;
and
all
doubt
and
quarrel
among
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
be
in
two
mind
about
fight
or
accept
a
pardon
,
and
who
indeed
do
both
,
see
at
last
that
there
be
nothing
to
expect
from
his
man
,
and
that
it
be
very
likely
some
of
them
would
deliver
him
up
and
get
a
reward
of
a
thousand
mark
,
which
be
offer
for
his
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
after
they
have
travel
and
quarrel
all
the
way
from
Southwark
to
Blackheath
,
and
from
Blackheath
to
Rochester
,
he
mount
a
good
horse
and
gallop
away
into
Sussex
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
gallop
after
him
,
on
a
well
horse
,
one
Alexander
Iden
,
who
come
up
with
him
,
have
a
hard
fight
with
him
,
and
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
head
be
set
aloft
on
London
Bridge
,
with
the
face
look
towards
Blackheath
,
where
he
have
raise
his
flag
;
and
Alexander
Iden
get
the
thousand
mark
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
by
some
,
that
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
have
be
remove
from
a
high
post
abroad
through
the
Queen
's
influence
,
and
send
out
of
the
way
,
to
govern
Ireland
,
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
rise
of
Jack
and
his
man
,
because
he
want
to
trouble
the
government
.
 
<EOS>
He
claim
(
though
not
yet
publicly
)
to
have
a
well
right
to
the
throne
than
Henry
of
Lancaster
,
as
one
of
the
family
of
the
Earl
of
March
,
whom
Henry
the
Fourth
have
set
aside
.
 
<EOS>
touch
this
claim
,
which
,
be
through
female
relationship
,
be
not
accord
to
the
usual
descent
,
it
be
enough
to
say
that
Henry
the
Fourth
be
the
free
choice
of
the
people
and
the
Parliament
,
and
that
his
family
have
now
reign
undisputed
for
sixty
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
memory
of
Henry
the
Fifth
be
so
famous
,
and
the
english
people
love
it
so
much
,
that
the
Duke
of
York
's
claim
would
,
perhaps
,
never
have
be
think
of
<EOS>
(
it
would
have
be
so
hopeless
)
but
for
the
unfortunate
circumstance
of
the
present
King
's
be
by
this
time
quite
an
idiot
,
and
the
country
very
ill
govern
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
circumstance
give
the
Duke
of
York
a
power
he
could
not
otherwise
have
have
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
Duke
know
anything
of
Jack
Cade
,
or
not
,
he
come
over
from
Ireland
while
Jack
's
head
be
on
London
Bridge
;
be
secretly
advise
that
the
Queen
be
set
up
his
enemy
,
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
Westminster
,
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
man
,
and
on
his
knee
before
the
King
,
represent
to
him
the
bad
state
of
the
country
,
and
petition
him
to
summon
a
Parliament
to
consider
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
the
King
promise
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Parliament
be
summon
,
the
Duke
of
York
accuse
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
and
the
Duke
of
Somerset
accuse
the
Duke
of
York
;
and
,
both
in
and
out
of
Parliament
,
the
follower
of
each
party
be
full
of
violence
and
hatred
towards
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
Duke
of
York
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
large
force
of
his
tenant
,
and
,
in
arm
,
demand
the
reformation
of
the
Government
.
 
<EOS>
be
shut
out
of
London
,
he
encamp
at
Dartford
,
and
the
royal
army
encamp
at
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
accord
as
either
side
triumph
,
the
Duke
of
York
be
arrest
,
or
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
the
trouble
end
,
for
the
moment
,
in
the
Duke
of
York
renew
his
oath
of
allegiance
,
and
go
in
peace
to
one
of
his
own
castle
.
  
<EOS>
half
a
year
afterwards
the
Queen
give
birth
to
a
son
,
who
be
very
ill
receive
by
the
people
,
and
not
believe
to
be
the
son
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
It
show
the
Duke
of
York
to
have
be
a
moderate
man
,
unwilling
to
involve
England
in
new
trouble
,
that
he
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
general
discontent
at
this
time
,
but
really
act
for
the
public
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
make
a
member
of
the
cabinet
,
and
the
King
be
now
so
much
bad
that
he
could
not
be
carry
about
and
show
to
the
people
with
any
decency
,
the
duke
be
make
Lord
Protector
of
the
kingdom
,
until
the
King
should
recover
,
or
the
Prince
should
come
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
commit
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
now
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
down
,
and
the
Duke
of
York
be
up
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
however
,
the
King
recover
his
memory
and
some
spark
of
sense
;
upon
which
the
Queen
use
her
power
---
which
recover
with
him
---
to
get
the
Protector
disgrace
,
and
her
favourite
release
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
the
Duke
of
York
be
down
,
and
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
up
.
  
<EOS>
these
ducal
up
and
down
gradually
separate
the
whole
nation
into
the
two
party
of
York
and
Lancaster
,
and
lead
to
those
terrible
civil
war
long
know
as
the
Wars
of
the
Red
and
White
Roses
,
because
the
red
rose
be
the
badge
of
the
House
of
Lancaster
,
and
the
white
rise
be
the
badge
of
the
House
of
York
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
York
,
join
by
some
other
powerful
nobleman
of
the
White
Rose
party
,
and
lead
a
small
army
,
meet
the
King
with
another
small
army
at
St
Alban
's
,
and
demand
that
the
Duke
of
Somerset
should
be
give
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
king
,
be
make
to
say
in
answer
that
he
would
sooner
die
,
be
instantly
attack
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
kill
,
and
the
King
himself
be
wound
in
the
neck
,
and
take
refuge
in
the
house
of
a
poor
tanner
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
the
Duke
of
York
go
to
him
,
lead
him
with
great
submission
to
the
Abbey
,
and
say
he
be
very
sorry
for
what
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
have
now
the
King
in
his
possession
,
he
get
a
Parliament
summon
and
himself
once
more
make
Protector
,
but
,
only
for
a
few
month
;
for
,
on
the
King
get
a
little
better
again
,
the
Queen
and
her
party
get
him
into
their
possession
,
and
disgrace
the
Duke
once
more
.
<EOS>
so
,
now
the
Duke
of
York
be
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
good
man
in
power
,
see
the
danger
of
these
constant
change
,
try
even
then
to
prevent
the
Red
and
the
White
Rose
Wars
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
about
a
great
council
in
London
between
the
two
party
.
 
<EOS>
the
White
Roses
assemble
in
Blackfriars
,
the
Red
Roses
in
Whitefriars
;
and
some
good
priest
communicate
between
them
,
and
make
the
proceeding
know
at
evening
to
the
King
and
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
They
end
in
a
peaceful
agreement
that
there
should
be
no
more
quarrelling
;
and
there
be
a
great
royal
procession
to
St
Paul
's
,
in
which
the
Queen
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
her
old
enemy
,
the
Duke
of
York
,
to
show
the
people
how
comfortable
they
all
be
.
<EOS>
this
state
of
peace
last
half
a
year
,
when
a
dispute
between
the
Earl
of
Warwick
(
one
of
the
Duke
's
powerful
friend
)
and
some
of
the
King
's
servant
at
Court
,
lead
to
an
attack
upon
that
Earl
---
who
be
a
White
Rose
---
and
to
a
sudden
breaking
out
of
all
old
animosity
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
here
be
great
up
and
down
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
even
great
up
and
down
than
these
,
soon
after
.
<EOS>
after
various
battle
,
the
Duke
of
York
flee
to
Ireland
,
and
his
son
the
Earl
of
March
to
Calais
,
with
their
friend
the
Earls
of
Salisbury
and
Warwick
;
and
a
Parliament
be
hold
declare
them
all
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
little
the
bad
for
this
<EOS>
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
presently
come
back
,
land
in
Kent
,
be
join
by
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
and
other
powerful
nobleman
and
gentleman
,
engage
the
King
's
force
at
Northampton
,
signally
defeat
them
,
and
take
the
King
himself
prisoner
,
who
be
find
in
his
tent
.
 
<EOS>
Warwick
would
have
be
glad
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
to
have
take
the
Queen
and
Prince
too
,
but
they
escape
into
Wales
and
thence
into
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
be
carry
by
the
victorious
force
straight
to
London
,
and
make
to
call
a
new
Parliament
,
which
immediately
declare
that
the
Duke
of
York
and
those
other
nobleman
be
not
traitor
,
but
excellent
subject
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
back
come
the
Duke
from
Ireland
at
the
head
of
five
hundred
horseman
,
ride
from
London
to
Westminster
,
and
enter
the
House
of
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
lay
his
hand
upon
the
cloth
of
gold
which
cover
the
empty
throne
,
as
if
he
have
half
a
mind
to
sit
down
in
it
---
but
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
ask
him
if
he
would
visit
the
King
,
who
be
in
his
palace
close
by
,
he
reply
,
"
I
know
no
one
in
this
country
,
my
lord
,
who
ought
not
to
visit
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
none
of
the
lord
present
speak
a
single
word
;
so
,
the
duke
go
out
as
he
have
come
in
,
establish
himself
royally
in
the
King
's
palace
,
and
,
six
day
afterwards
,
send
in
to
the
Lords
a
formal
statement
of
his
claim
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
the
lord
go
to
the
King
on
this
momentous
subject
,
and
after
a
great
deal
of
discussion
,
in
which
the
judge
and
the
other
law
officer
be
afraid
to
give
an
opinion
on
either
side
,
the
question
be
compromise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
the
present
King
should
retain
the
crown
for
his
life
,
and
that
it
should
then
pass
to
the
Duke
of
York
and
his
heir
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
resolute
Queen
,
determine
on
assert
her
son
's
right
,
would
hear
of
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
from
Scotland
to
the
north
of
England
,
where
several
powerful
lord
arm
in
her
cause

his
power

such
great
help
to
place
Edward

<EOS>
this
offence
be
not
lessen
by
the
jealousy
with
which
the
Nevil
family
(
the
Earl

<EOS>
the
Earl

Warwick
take
all
this
pretty
graciously
for
a
man

until
the
question

upon

and
shut
himself
up

in
his
Castle
of
Middleham
.
  
<EOS>
a
reconciliation
,
though
not
a
very
sincere
one

their
complaint

that

whom
they
demand
to
have

<EOS>
as
they

the
Earl

the

at

in
the
strange
position
of

once
,
but
they
be
both
prisoner
at

and
there
innumerable
pledge
of
forgiveness

another

be
patch
up
between

but
it

a
short
one

and
it
be
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
a
new
rise
take
place
in
Lincolnshire
,
and
the
King
march
to
repress
it
.
 
<EOS>
have
do
so
,
he
proclaim
that
both
the
Earl

the
Duke

Clarence
be
traitor
,
who

and
who

<EOS>
in
these
dangerous
circumstance
they
both
take
ship
and
sail
away
to
the
french

<EOS>
and
here
a
meeting
take
place
between
the
Earl

Warwick
and
his
old
enemy
,
the
Dowager
Queen
Margaret
,
through
whom
his
father
have
have
his
head
strike
off
,
and
to
whom
he
have
be
a
bitter
foe
.
<EOS>
but
,
now
,
when
he
say
that
he
have
do
with
the
ungrateful
and
perfidious
Edward
of
York
,
and
that
henceforth
he
devote
himself
to
the
restoration
of
the
House
of
Lancaster
,
either
in
the
person
of
her
husband

of

she
embrace
him
as

<EOS>
She
do
more
than
that
;
she
marry
her
son
to
his
second
daughter
,
the
Lady
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
however
agreeable
this
marriage
be
to
the
new
friend
,
it
be
very
disagreeable
to
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
perceive
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
the
King
-
Maker
,
would
never
make
him
King
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
be
but
a
weak
-
minded
young
traitor
,
possess
of
very
little
worth
or
sense
,
he
readily
listen
to
an
artful
court
lady
send
over
for
the
purpose
,
and
promise
to
turn
traitor
once
more
,
and
go
over
to
his
brother
,
King
Edward
,
when
a
fitting
opportunity
should
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
know
nothing
of
this
,
soon
redeem
his
promise
to
the
Dowager
Queen
Margaret
,
by
invade
England
and
landing
at
Plymouth
,
where
he
instantly
proclaim
King
Henry
,
and
summon
all
englishman
between
the
age
of
sixteen
and
sixty
,
to
join
his
banner
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
his
army
increase
as
he
march
along
,
he
go
northward
,
and
come
so
near
King
Edward
,
who
be
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
that
Edward
have
to
ride
hard
for
it
to
the
coast
of
Norfolk
,
and
thence
to
get
away
in
such
ship
as
he
could
find
,
to
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
thereupon
,
the
triumphant
King
-
Maker
and
his
false
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
go
to
London
,
take
the
old
King
out
of
the
Tower
,
and
walk
him
in
a
great
procession
to
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
with
the
crown
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
improve
the
temper
of
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
see
himself
farther
off
from
be
King
than
ever
;
but
he
keep
his
secret
,
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
Nevil
family
be
restore
to
all
their
honour
and
glory
,
and
the
Woodvilles
and
the
rest
be
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
-
Maker
,
less
sanguinary
than
the
King
,
shed
no
blood
except
that
of
the
Earl
of
Worcester
,
who
have
be
so
cruel
to
the
people
as
to
have
gain
the
title
of
the
Butcher
.
 
<EOS>
Him
<EOS>
they
catch
hide
in
a
tree
,
and
him
they
try
and
execute
.
 
<EOS>
no
other
death
stain
the
King
-
Maker
's
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
to
dispute
this
triumph
,
back
come
King
Edward
again
,
next
year
,
land
at
Ravenspur
,
come
on
to
York
,
cause
all
his
man
to
cry
"
long
live
King
Henry
!
"
and
swear
on
the
altar
,
without
a
blush
,
that
he
come
to
lay
no
claim
to
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
now
be
the
time
for
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
order
his
man
to
assume
the
White
Rose
,
and
declare
for
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
the
Marquis
of
Montague
,
though
the
Earl
of
Warwick
's
brother
,
also
decline
to
fight
against
King
Edward
,
he
go
on
successfully
to
London
,
where
the
Archbishop
of
York
let
him
into
the
City
,
and
where
the
people
make
great
demonstration
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
they
have
four
reason
.
<EOS>
firstly
,
there
be
great
number
of
the
King
's
adherent
hide
in
the
City
and
ready
to
break
out
;
secondly
,
the
King
owe
them
a
great
deal
of
money
,
which
they
could
never
hope
to
get
if
he
be
unsuccessful
;
thirdly
,
there
be
a
young
prince
to
inherit
the
crown
;
and
fourthly
,
the
King
be
gay
and
handsome
,
and
more
popular
than
a
well
man
may
have
be
with
the
city
lady
.
<EOS>
after
a
stay
of
only
two
day
with
these
worthy
supporter
,
the
King
march
out
to
Barnet
Common
,
to
give
the
Earl
of
Warwick
battle
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
to
be
see
,
for
the
last
time
,
whether
the
King
or
the
King
-
Maker
be
to
carry
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
battle
be
yet
pende
,
the
fainthearte
Duke
of
Clarence
begin
to
repent
,
and
send
over
secret
message
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
offer
his
service
in
mediation
with
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
disdainfully
reject
them
,
and
reply
that
Clarence
be
false
and
perjured
,
and
that
he
would
settle
the
quarrel
by
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
the
battle
begin
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
last
until
ten
,
and
during
the
great
part
of
the
time
it
be
fight
in
a
thick
mist
---
absurdly
suppose
to
be
raise
by
a
magician
.
 
<EOS>
the
loss
of
life
be
very
great
,
for
the
hatred
be
strong
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
-
Maker
be
defeat
,
and
the
King
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
both
the
Earl
of
Warwick
and
his
brother
be
slay
,
and
their
body
lie
in
St
Paul
's
,
for
some
day
,
as
a
spectacle
to
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret

spirit
be
not

even
by
this
great
blow
.
 
<EOS>
within
five
day
she
be

,
and
raise
her
standard
in
Bath

whence
she
set
off
with
her
army
,
to
try
and
join
Lord
Pembroke
,
who
have
a
force
in
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
King
,
come
up
with
her
outside
the
town
of
Tewkesbury
,
and
order
his
brother
,
the
DUKE

an
entire
defeat
,
and
be
take
prisoner
,
together
with
her
son
,
now
only
eighteen
year
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
the
conduct
of
the
King
to
this
poor
youth
be
worthy
of
his
cruel
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
order
him
to
be
lead
into
his
tent
.
 
<EOS>
"
and

"
 
<EOS>
"

my

"
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
draw
off
his
iron
gauntlet
,
strike
him
with
it
in
the
face
;
and
the
Duke
of
Clarence
and
some
other
lord
,
who
be
there
,
draw
their
noble
sword
,
and
kill
him
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
survive
him
,
a
prisoner
,
for
five
year
;
after
her
ransom
by
the
King
of
France
,
she

<EOS>
within
three
week
of
this
murder
,
Henry
die
one
of
those
convenient
sudden
death
which
be
so
common
in
the
Tower
;
in
plainer
word
,
he
be
murder
by
the
King
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
have
no
particular
excitement
on
his
hand
after
this
great
defeat
of
the
Lancaster
party
,
and
be
perhaps
desirous
to
get
rid
of
some
of
his
fat
(
for
he
be
now
get
too
corpulent
to
be
handsome
)
,
the
King
think
of
make
war
on
France
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
want
more
money
for
this
purpose
than
the
Parliament
could
give
him
,
though
they
be
usually
ready
enough
for
war
,
he
invent
a
new
way
of
raise
it
,
by
send
for
the
principal
citizen
of
London
,
and
tell
them
,
with
a
grave
face
,
that
he
be
very
much
in
want
of
cash
,
and
would
take
it
very
kind
in
them
if
they
would
lend
him
some
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
them
safely
to
refuse
,
they
comply
,
and
the
money
thus
force
from
them
be
call
---
no
doubt
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
King
and
the
Court
---
as
if
they
be
free
gift
,
"
benevolence

"
 
<EOS>
what
with
grant
from
Parliament
,
and
what
with
Benevolences
,
the
King
raise
an
army
and
pass
over
to
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
as
nobody
want
war
,
however
,
the
french
King
make
proposal
of
peace
,
which
be
accept
,
and
a
truce
be
conclude
for
seven
long
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
proceeding
between
the
king
of
France
and
England
on
this
occasion
,
be
very
friendly
,
very
splendid
,
and
very
distrustful
.
 
<EOS>
They
finish
with
a
meeting
between
the
two
king
,
on
a
temporary
bridge
over
the
river
Somme
,
where
they
embrace
through
two
hole
in
a
strong
wooden
grating
like
a
lion
's
cage
,
and
make
several
bow
and
fine
speech
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
time
,
now
,
that
the
Duke
of
Clarence
should
be
punish
for
his
treachery
;
and
Fate
have
his
punishment
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
probably
,
not
trust
by
the
King
---
for
who
could
trust
him
who
know
him
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
he
have
certainly
a
powerful
opponent
in
his
brother
Richard
,
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
who
,
be
avaricious
and
ambitious
,
want
to
marry
that
widow
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Warwick
's
who
have
be
espouse
to
the
deceased
young

<EOS>
Clarence

who
want
all
the

wealth
for
himself

secrete
this
lady
,
whom
Richard
find
disguise
as
a
servant
in
the
City
of
London
,
and
whom
he
marry
;
arbitrator
appoint
by
the
King
,
then
divide
the
property
between
the
brother
.
 
<EOS>
this
lead
to
ill
-
will
and
mistrust
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Clarence
's
wife
die
,
and
he
wish
to
make
another
marriage
,
which
be
obnoxious
to
the
King
<EOS>
,
his
ruin
be
hurry
by
that
mean
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
the
Court
strike
at
his
retainer
and
dependent
,
and
accuse
some
of
them
of
magic
and
witchcraft
,
and
similar
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
successful
against
this
small
game
,
it
then
mount
to
the
Duke
himself
,
who
be
impeach
by
his
brother
the
King
,
in

on
a
variety
of
such
charge
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
find
guilty
,
and
sentence
to
be
publicly
execute
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
be
publicly
execute
,
but
he
meet
his
death
somehow
,
in
the
Tower
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
through
some
agency
of
the
King
or
his
brother
Gloucester
,
or
both
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
at
the
time
that
he
be
tell
to
choose
the
manner
of
his
death
,
and
that
he
choose
to
be
drown
in
a
butt
of
Malmsey
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
story
may
be
true
,
for
it
would
have
be
a
become
death
for
such
a
miserable
creature
.

the

He
die
in
the
forty

third
of
his
reign

<EOS>
He
have
a
very
good
capacity
and
some
good
point

but
he
be
selfish

careless

sensual

and
cruel

<EOS>
He
be
a
favourite
with
the
people
for
his
showy
manner
;
and
the
people
be
a
good
example
to
him
in
the
constancy
of
their
attachment

<EOS>
He
be
penitent
on
his

He

and
endeavour
to

for
the
sake
of
the

most

and
most
dreaded
nobleman
in
England
at
that

their

and
everybody
wonder
how
the

poor

would
fare
with
such
an

for
a

or
a
foe
.
  
<EOS>
the

be
anxious
that
instruction
should

Rivers
to
raise
an
army
to
escort
the

but
,
Lord
Hastings

who

Court
party
oppose
to
the
Woodvilles
,
and
who
dislike
the
thought

<EOS>
argue
against
the

and
oblige
the

satisfied
with
an

of
two
thousand
horse

<EOS>
the

He

<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
while
they
be
merry
together
,
up
come

with
three
hundred

;
and

and
the
two
duke
,
and
the
three
hundred
horseman
,

away
together
to
rejoin

<EOS>
just
as
they
be
enter
Stony
Stratford
,
the
Duke

,
check
his
horse
,
turn
suddenly
on
the
two

,
charge

with
alienate
from

the
affection
of
his
sweet
nephew
,
and
cause
them
to
be
arrest
by
the
three
hundred
horseman
and
take

.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
and
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
go
straight
to
the
King
(
whom
they
have
now
in
their
power
)
,
to
whom
they
make
a
show
of
kneel
down
,
and
offer
great
love
and
submission
;
and
then
they
order
his
attendant
to
disperse
,
and
take
him
,
alone
with
them
,
to
Northampton
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
afterwards
they
conduct
him
to
London
,
and
lodge
him
in
the
Bishop
's
Palace
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
do
not
remain
there
long
;
for
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
with
a
tender
face
make
a
speech
express
how
anxious
he
be
for
the
Royal
boy
's
safety
,
and
how
much
safe
he
would
be
in
the
Tower
until
his
coronation
,
than
he
could
be
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
to
the
Tower
he
be
take
,
very
carefully
,
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
be
name
Protector
of
the
State
.
  
<EOS>
although
Gloucester
have
proceed
thus
far
with
a
very
smooth
countenance
---
and
although
he
be
a
clever
man
,
fair
of
speech
,
and
not
ill
-
look
,
in
spite
of
one
of
his
shoulder
be
something
high
than
the
other
---
and
although
he
have
come
into
the
City
ride
bare
-
head
at
the
King
's
side
,
and
look
very
fond
of
him
---
he
have
make
the
King
's
mother
more
uneasy
yet
;
and
when
the
Royal
boy
be
take
to
the
Tower
,
she
become
so
alarmed
that
she
take
sanctuary
in
Westminster
with
her
five
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
she
do
this
without
reason
,
for
,
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
find
that
the
lord
who
be
oppose
to
the
Woodville
family
be
faithful
to
the
young
King
nevertheless
,
quickly
resolve
to
strike
a
blow
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
while
those
lord
meet
in
council
at
the
Tower
,
he
and
those
who
be
in
his
interest
meet
in
separate
council
at
his
own
residence
,
Crosby
Palace
,
in
Bishopsgate
Street
.
 
<EOS>
be
at
last
quite
prepared
,
he
one
day
appear
unexpectedly
at
the
council
in
the
Tower
,
and
appear
to
be
very
jocular
and
merry
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
particularly
gay
with
the
Bishop
of
Ely
:
 
praise
the
strawberry
that
grow
in
his
garden
on
Holborn
Hill
,
and
ask
him
to
have
some
gather
that
he
may
eat
them
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
,
quite
proud
of
the
honour
,
send
one
of
his
man
to
fetch
some
;
and
the
Duke
,
still
very
jocular
and
gay
,
go
out
;
and
the
council
all
say
what
a
very
agreeable
duke
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
,
however
,
he
come
back
quite
altered
---
not
at
all
jocular
---
frowning
and
fierce
---
and
suddenly
say
,
---
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
those
person
deserve
who
have
compass
my
destruction
;
I
be
the
King
's
lawful
,
as
well
as
natural
,
protector
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
strange
question
,
Lord
Hastings
reply
,
that
they
deserve
death
,
whosoever
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
"
I
tell
you
that

sorceress
my
brother

and

<EOS>
who
,
by
witchcraft
,
have
wither
my
body
,
and
cause
my
arm
to
shrink
as
I
now
show
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
pull
up
his
sleeve
and
show
them
his
arm
,
which
be
shrink
,
it
be
true
,
but
which
have
be
so
,
as
they
all
very
well
know
,
from
the
hour
of
his
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Shore
,
be
then
the
lover
of
Lord
Hastings
,
as
she
have
formerly
be
of
the
late
King
,
that
lord
know
that
he
himself
be
attack
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
say
,
in
some
confusion
,
"
certainly
,
my
Lord
,
if
they
have
do
this
,
they
be
worthy
of
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
?
"
say
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
;
"
do
you
talk
to
me
of
ifs
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
they
have
so
do
,
and
I
will
make
it
good
upon
thy
body
,
thou
traitor
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
strike
the
table
a
great
blow
with
his
fist
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
signal
to
some
of
his
people
outside
to
cry
"
treason
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
immediately
do
so
,
and
there
be
a
rush
into
the
chamber
of
so
many
armed
man
that
it
be
fill
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"

,
"
say
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
to
Lord
Hastings
,
"
I
arrest
thee

<EOS>
and

he

"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Hastings
be
hurry
to

green
by
the
Tower
chapel
,
and
there
behead
on
a
log
of
wood
that
happen

.
 
<EOS>
then
,

and
after

He

and
issue
a
proclamation
(
prepared
and
neatly

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
have
now
all
thing
ready
for
his
own
advancement
,
he
cause
a
friar
to
preach
a
sermon
at
the
cross
which

"

the
perfect
image
and

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
little
plot
between
the
Duke
and
the
friar
,
that
the
Duke
should
appear
in
the
crowd
at
this
moment
,
when
it
be
expect
that
the
people
would
cry
"
long
live
King
Richard
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
either
through
the
friar
say
the
word
too
soon
,
or
through
the
Duke
's
come
too
late
,
the
Duke
and
the
word
do
not
come
together
,
and
the
people
only
laugh
,
and
the
friar
sneak
off
ashamed
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
be
a
well
hand
at
such
business
than
the
friar
,
so
he
go
to
the
Guildhall
the
next
day
,
and
address
the
citizen
in
the
Lord
Protector
's
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
dirty
man
,
who
have
be
hire
and
station
there
for
the
purpose
,
cry
when
he
have
do
,
"
God
save
King
Richard
!
"
<EOS>
he
make
them
a
great
bow
,
and
thank
them
with
all
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
to
make
an
end
of
it
,
he
go
with
the
mayor
and
some
lord
and
citizen
to
Bayard
Castle
,
by
the
river
,
where
Richard
then
be
,
and
read
an
address
,
humbly
entreat
him
to
accept
the
Crown
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
,
who
look
down
upon
them
out
of
a
window
and
pretend
to
be
in
great
uneasiness
and
alarm
,
assure
them
there
be
nothing
he
desire
less
,
and
that
his
deep
affection
for
his
nephews
forbid
him
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
reply
,
with
pretended
warmth
,
that
the
free
people
of
England
would
never
submit
to
his
nephew
's
rule
,
and
that
if
Richard
,
who
be
the
lawful
heir
,
refuse
the
Crown
,
why
then
they
must
find
some
one
else
to
wear
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
return
,
that
since
he
use
that
strong
language
,
it
become
his
painful
duty
to
think
no
more
of
himself
,
and
to
accept
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
upon
that
,
the
people
cheer
and
disperse
;
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
and
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
pass
a
pleasant
evening
,
talk
over
the
play
they
have
just
act
with
so
much
success
,
and
every
word
of
which
they
have
prepare
together
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Richard
<EOS>
the
Third
    
KING
RICHARD
<EOS>
the
THIRD

up
betime
in
the
morning
,
and
go
to
Westminster
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Hall
be
a
marble
seat
,
upon
which
he
sit
himself
down
between
two
great
nobleman
,
and
tell
the
people
that
he
begin
the
new
reign
in
that
place
,
because
the
first
duty
of
a
sovereign
be
to
administer
the
law
equally
to
all
,
and
to
maintain
justice
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
mount
his
horse
and
ride
back
to
the
City
,
where
he
be
receive
by
the
clergy
and
the
crowd
as
if
he
really
have
a
right
to
the
throne
,
and
really
be
a
just
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
clergy
and
the
crowd
must
have
be
rather
ashamed
of
themselves
in
secret
,
I
think
,
for
be
such
poor
-
spirit
knave
.
  
<EOS>
the
new
King
and
his
Queen
be
soon
crown
with
a
great
deal
of
show
and
noise
,
which
the
people
like
very
much
;
and
then
the
King
set
forth
on
a
royal
progress
through
his
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
crown
a
second
time
at
York
,
in
order
that
the
people
may
have
show
and
noise
enough
;
and
wherever
he
go
be
receive
with
shout
of
rejoicing
---
from
a
good
many
people
of
strong
lung
,
who
be
pay
to
strain
their
throat
in
crying
,
"
God
save
King
Richard
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
plan
be
so
successful
that
I
be
tell
it
have
be
imitate
since
,
by
other
usurper
,
in
other
progress
through
other

<EOS>
while

a
week
at
Warwick
.
 
<EOS>
and
from

of
the
wickedest

---
the
murder

and
spur
along
the
dusty
road
,
with
the
answer
that
he

so
horrible
a

of

<EOS>
the

and
thus

<EOS>

,
and
for
a
great
rise

in
several
part
of
England
at
the
same
hour
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
certain
day
,
therefore
,
in
October
,
the
revolt
take
place
;
but
unsuccessfully
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
be
prepare
,
Henry

by
a

,
his

and

and
at

<EOS>
the
time
of
his
success
be
a
good
time
,
Richard
think
,
for
summon
a
Parliament
and
get
some
money
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
a
Parliament
be
call
,
and
it
flatter
and
fawn
upon
him
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
desire
,
and
declare
him
to
be
the
rightful
King
of
England
,
and
his
only
son
Edward
,
then
eleven
year
of
age
,
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
know
full
well
that
,
let
the
Parliament
say
what
it
would
,
the
Princess
Elizabeth
be
remember
by
people
as
the
heiress
of
the
house
of
York
;
and
have
accurate
information
besides
,
of
its
be
design
by
the
conspirator
to
marry
her
to
Henry
of
Richmond
,
he
feel
that
it
would
much
strengthen
him
and
weaken
them
,
to
be
beforehand
with
them
,
and
marry
her
to
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
go
to
the
Sanctuary
at
Westminster
,
where
the
late
King
's
widow
and
her
daughter
still
be
,
and
besought
them
to
come
to
Court
:
 
<EOS>
where
(
he
swear
by
anything
and
everything
)
<EOS>
they
should
be
safely
and
honourably
entertain
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
,
accordingly
,
but
have
scarcely
be
at
Court
a
month
when
his
son
die
suddenly
---
or
be
poison
---
and
his
plan
be
crush
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
extremity
,
King
Richard
,
always
active
,
think
,
"
I
must
make
another
plan
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
make
the
plan
of
marry
the
Princess
Elizabeth
himself
,
although
she
be
his
niece
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
difficulty
in
the
way
:
 
his
wife
,
the
Queen
Anne
,
be
alive
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
know
(
remember
his
nephews
)
how
to
remove
that
obstacle
,
and
he
make
love
to
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
tell
her
he
feel
perfectly
confident
that
the
Queen
would
die
in
February
.
 
<EOS>
the
Princess
be
not
a
very
scrupulous
young
lady
,
for
,
instead
of
reject
the
murderer
of
her
brother
with
scorn
and
hatred
,
she
openly
declare
she
love
him
dearly
;
and
,
when
February
come
and
the
Queen
do
not
die
,
she
express
her
impatient
opinion
that
she
be
too
long
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
King
Richard
be
not
so
far
out
in
his
prediction
,
but
,
that
she
die
in
March
---
he
take
good
care
of
that
---
and
then
this
precious
pair
hope
to
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
disappoint
,
for
the
idea
of
such
a
marriage
<EOS>
be
so
unpopular
in
the
country
,
that
the
King
's
chief
counsellor
,
RATCLIFFE
and
CATESBY
,
would
by
no
means
undertake
to
propose
it
,
and
the
King
be
even
oblige
to
declare
in
public
that
he
have
never
think
of
such
a
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He

and
for
want
of
money

almost
anything
for

He

his
chief
merit
appear
to
have
be
that
he
be
not
cruel
when
there

Sweating

<EOS>
Lord
Mayors

Aldermen
be
think
to
have
suffer
most
from
it

whether
,
because
they
be
in

<EOS>
however

right
in
the
end

by
hang
some

more

the
late

,
at
first

be
get
from

and
,
by
employ
about
his
Court
,
some
very
scrupulous
person
who
have
be
employ
in
the
previous
reign

<EOS>
as
this
reign
be
principally
remarkable
for
two
very
curious
imposture
which
have
become
famous
in
history
,
we
will
make
those
two
story
its
principal
feature
.
  
<EOS>
there

a
priest
at
Oxford
of
the
name
of
simon
,
who
have
for
a
pupil
a
handsome
boy
name
Lambert
Simnel
,
the
son
of
a
baker
.
<EOS>
partly
to
gratify
his
own
ambitious
end
,
and
partly
to
carry
out
the
design
of
a
secret
party
form
against
the
King
,
this
priest
declare
that
his
pupil
,
the
boy
,
be
no
other

the
young
Earl
of
Warwick
;
who
(
as
everybody
may
have
know
)
be
safely
lock
up
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
priest
and
the
boy
go
over
to
Ireland
;
and
,
at
Dublin
,
enlist
in
their
cause
all
rank
of
the
people
:
 
who
seem
to
have
be
generous
enough
,
but
exceedingly
irrational
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Kildare
,
the
governor
of
Ireland
,
declare
that
he
believe
the
boy
to
be
what
the
priest
represent
;
and
the
boy
,
who
have
be
well
tutor
by
the
priest
,
tell
them
such
thing
of
his
childhood
,
and
give
them
so
many
description
of
the
Royal
Family
,
that
they
be
perpetually
shout
and
hurrah
,
and
drink
his
health
,
and
make
all
kind
of
noisy
and
thirsty
demonstration
,
to
express
their
belief
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
feeling
confine
to
Ireland
alone
,
for
the
Earl

Lincoln
---
whom
the
late
usurper
have
name
as
his
successor
<EOS>
---
go
over
to
the
young
Pretender

and
,
after
hold
a
secret
correspondence
with
the
Dowager
Duchess

the
sister

,
who
detest
the
present
King
and
all
his
race
---
sail
to
Dublin
with
two
thousand
german
soldier
of
her
providing
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
promising
state
of
the
boy
's
fortune
,
he
be
crown
there
,
with
a
crown
take
off
the
head
of
a
statue
of
the
Virgin

;
and
be
then

accord
to
the
irish

shoulder
of
a
big
chieftain

<EOS>
Father
Simons
,
you
may
be
sure
,
be
mighty
busy
at
the
coronation
.
  
<EOS>
ten
day
afterwards
,
the
Germans

and
the
irish

and
the
priest
,
and
the
boy
,
and
the
Earl
of
Lincoln
,
all
land
in
Lancashire
to
invade
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
who
have
good
intelligence
of
their
movement
,
set
up
his
standard
at
Nottingham
,
where
vast
number
resort
to
him
every
day
;
while
the
Earl
of
Lincoln
could
gain
but
very
few
.
 
<EOS>
with
his
small
force
he
try
to
make
for
the
town
of
Newark
;
but
the
King
's
army
get
between
him
and
that
place
,
he
have
no
choice
but
to
risk
a
battle
at
Stoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
end
in
the
complete
destruction
of
the
Pretender
's
force
,
one
half
of
whom
be
kill

among
them
,
the
Earl
himself

<EOS>
the
priest
and
the
baker

boy
be
take
prisoner

<EOS>
the
priest
,
after
confess
the
trick
,
be
shut
up
in
prison
,
where
he
afterwards
die
---
suddenly
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
be
take
into
the
King

kitchen
and
make
a
turnspit
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
afterwards
raise
to
the
station
of
one
of
the
King
's
falconer
;
and
so
end
this
strange
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
there
seem
reason
to
suspect
that
the
Dowager
Queen
---
always
a
restless
and
busy
woman
---
have
have
some
share
in
tutor
the
baker
's
son
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
very
angry
with
her
,
whether
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
seize
upon
her
property
,
and
shut
her
up
in
a
convent
at
Bermondsey
.
  
<EOS>
one
may
suppose
that
the
end
of
this
story
would
have
put
the
irish
people
on
their
guard
;
but
they
be
quite
ready
to
receive
a
second
impostor
,
as
they
have
receive
the
first
,
and
that
same
troublesome
Duchess
of
Burgundy
soon
give
them
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
there
appear
at
Cork

Duke

the

at
present
---
and
have
be
wander
about
the
world
for
seven
long
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
explanation
be
quite
satisfactory
to
number
of
the
irish
people
,
they
begin
again
to
shout
and
to
hurrah
,
and
to
drink
his
health
,
and
to
make
the
noisy
and
thirsty
demonstration
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
big
chieftain
in
Dublin
begin
to
look
out
for
another
coronation
,
and
another
young
King
to
be
carry
home
on
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
King
Henry
be
then
on
bad
term
with
France
,
the
french
King
,
Charles
the
Eighth
,
see
that
,
by
pretend
to
believe
in
the
handsome
young
man
,
he
could
trouble
his
enemy
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
invite
him
over
to
the
French
Court
,
and
appoint
him
a
body
-
guard
,
and
treat
him
in
all
respect
as
if
he
really
be
the
Duke
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
peace
,
however
,
be
soon
conclude
between
the
two
king
,
the
pretended
Duke
be
turn
adrift
,
and
wander
for
protection
to
the
Duchess
of
Burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
after
feign
to
inquire
into
the
reality
of
his
claim
,
declare
him
to
be
the
very
picture
of
her
dear
depart
brother
;
give
him
a
body
-
guard
at
her
Court
,
of
thirty
halberdier
;
and
call
him
by
the
sound
name
of
the
White
Rose
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
the
lead
member
of
the
White
Rose
party
in
England
send
over
an
agent
,
name
Sir
Robert
Clifford
,
to
ascertain
whether
the
White
Rose
's
claim
be
good
:
 
<EOS>
the
King
also
send
over
his
agent
to
inquire
into
the
Rose
's
history
.
 
<EOS>
the
White
Roses
declare
the
young
man
to
be
really
the
Duke
of
York
;
the
King
declare
him
to
be
PERKIN
WARBECK
,
the
son
of
a
merchant
of
the
city
of
Tournay
,
who
have
acquire
his
knowledge
of
England
,
its
language
and
manner
,
from
the
english
merchant
who
trade
in
flander
;
it
be
also
state
by
the
royal
agent
that
he
have
be
in
the
service
of
Lady
Brompton
,
the
wife
of
an
exile
English
nobleman
,
and
that
the
Duchess
of
Burgundy
have
cause
him
to
be
train
and
teach
,
expressly
for
this
deception
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
then
require
the
Archduke
Philip
---
who
be
the
sovereign
of
Burgundy
---
to
banish
this
new
Pretender
,
or
to
deliver
him
up
;
but
,
as
the
Archduke
reply
that
he
could
not
control
the
Duchess
in
her
own
land
,
the
King
,
in
revenge
,
take
the
market
of
english
cloth
away
from
Antwerp
,
and
prevent
all
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
country
.
  
<EOS>
He
also
,
by
art
and
bribe
,
prevail
on
Sir
Robert
Clifford
to
betray
his
employer
;
and
he
denounce
several
famous
english
nobleman
as
be
secretly
the
friend
of
Perkin
Warbeck
,
the
King
have
three
of
the
foremost
execute
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
pardon
the
remainder
because
they
be
poor
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
it
be
only
too
probable
that
he
refuse
to
pardon
one
famous
nobleman
against
whom
the
same
Clifford
soon
afterwards
inform
separately
,
because
he
be
rich
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
Sir
William
Stanley
,
who
have
save
the
King
's
life
at
the
battle
of
Bosworth
Field
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
doubtful
whether
his
treason
amount
to
much
more
than
his
have
say
,
that
if
he
be
sure
the
young
man
be
the
Duke
of
York
,
he
would
not
take
arm
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
he
have
do
he
admit
,
like
an
honourable
spirit
;
and
he
lose
his
head
for
it
,
and
the
covetous
King
gain
all
his
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
Perkin
Warbeck
keep
quiet
for
three
year
;
but
,
as
the
Flemings
begin
to
complain
heavily
of
the
loss
of
their
trade
by
the
stoppage
of
the
Antwerp
market
on
his
account
,
and
as
it
be
not
unlikely
that
they
may
even
go
so
far
as
to
take
his
life
,
or
give
him
up
,
he
find
it
necessary
to
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
he
make
a
desperate
sally
,
and
land
,
with
only
a
few
hundred
man
,
on
the
coast
of
Deal
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
soon
glad
to
get
back
to
the
place
from
whence
<EOS>
he
come
;
for
the
country
people
rise
against
his
follower
,
kill
a
great
many
,
and
take
a
hundred
and
fifty
prisoner
:
 
who
be
all
drive
to
London
,
tie
together
with
rope
,
like
a
team
of
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
of
them
be
hang
on
some
part
or
other
of
the
sea
-
shore
;
in
order
,
that
if
any
more
man
should
come
over
with
Perkin
Warbeck
,
they
may
see
the
body
as
a
warning
before
they
land
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
wary
King
,
by
make
a
treaty
of
commerce
with
the
Flemings
,
drive
Perkin
Warbeck
out
of
that
country
;
and
,
by
completely
gain
over
the
Irish
to
his
side
,
deprive
him
of
that
asylum
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
wander
away
to
Scotland
,
and
tell
his
story
at
that
Court
.
 
<EOS>
King
James
the
Fourth
of
Scotland
,
who
be
no
friend
to
King
Henry
,
and
have
no
reason
to
be
(
for
King
Henry
have
bribe
his
Scotch
lord
to
betray
him
more
than
once
;
but
have
never
succeed
in
his
plot
)
,
give
him
a
great
reception
,
call
him
his
cousin
,
and
give
him
in
marriage
the
Lady
Catherine
Gordon
,
a
beautiful
and
charming
creature
relate
to
the
royal
house
of
Stuart
.
  
<EOS>
alarm
by
this
successful
reappearance
of
the
Pretender
,
the
King
still
undermine
,
and
buy
,
and
bribe
,
and
keep
his
doing
and
Perkin
Warbeck
's
story
in
the
dark
,
when
he
may
,
one
would
imagine
,
have
render
the
matter
clear
to
all
England
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
this
bribing
of
the
Scotch
lord
at
the
Scotch
King
's
court
,
he
could
not
procure
the
Pretender
to
be
deliver
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
James
,
though
not
very
particular
in
many
respect
,
would
not
betray
him
;
and
the
ever
-
busy
Duchess
of
Burgundy
so
provide
him
with
arm
,
and
good
soldier
,
and
with
money
besides
,
that
he
have
soon
a
little
army
of
fifteen
hundred
man
of
various
nation
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
,
and
aid
by
the
scottish
King
in
person
,
he
cross
the
border
into
England
,
and
make
a
proclamation
to
the
people
,
in
which
he
call
the
King
"
Henry
Tudor
;
"
offer
large
reward
to
any
who
should
take
or
distress
him
;
and
announce
himself
as
King
Richard
the
Fourth
come
to
receive
the
homage
of
his
faithful
subject
.
<EOS>
His
faithful
subject
,
however
,
care
nothing
for
him
,
and
hate
his
faithful
troop
:
 
who
,
be
of
different
nation
,
quarrel
also
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
bad
than
this
,
if
bad
be
possible
,
they
begin
to
plunder
the
country
;
upon
which
the
White
Rose
say
,
that
he
would
rather
lose
his
right
,
than
gain
them
through
the
misery
of
the
english
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
Scottish
King
make
a
jest
of
his
scruple
;
but
they
and
their
whole
force
go
back
again
without
fight
a
battle
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
consequence
of
this
attempt
be
,
that
a
rise
take
place
among
the
people
of
Cornwall
,
who
consider
themselves
too
heavily
tax
to
meet
the
charge
of
the
expect
war
.
 
<EOS>
stimulate
by
Flammock
,
a
lawyer
,
and
Joseph
,
a
blacksmith
,
and
join
by
Lord
Audley
and
some
other
country
gentleman
,
they
march
on
all
the
way
to
Deptford
Bridge
,
where
they
fight
a
battle
with
the
King
's
army
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
defeat
---
though
the
cornish
man
fight
with
great
bravery
---
and
the
lord
be
behead
,
and
the
lawyer
and
the
blacksmith
be
hang
,
draw
,
and
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
be
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
who
believe
every
man
to
be
as
avaricious
as
himself
,
and
think
that
money
could
settle
anything
,
allow
them
to
make
bargain
for
their
liberty
with
the
soldier
who
have
take
them
.
  
<EOS>
Perkin
Warbeck
,
doom
to
wander
up
and
down
,
and
never
to
find
rest
anywhere
---
a
sad
fate
:
 
almost
a
sufficient
punishment
for
an
imposture
,
which
he
seem
in
time
to
have
half
believe
himself
---
lose
his
scottish
refuge
through
a
truce
be
make
between
the
two
king
;
and
find
himself
,
once
more
,
without
a
country
before
him
in
which
he
could
lay
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
James
(
always
honourable
and
true
to
him
,
alike
when
he
melt
down
his
plate
,
and
even
the
great
gold
chain
he
have
be
use
to
wear
,
to
pay
soldier
in
his
cause
;
and
now
,
when
that
cause
be
lose
and
hopeless
)
do
not
conclude
the
treaty
,
until
he
have
safely
depart
out
of
the
scottish
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
and
his
beautiful
wife
,
who
be
faithful
to
him
under
all
reverse
,
and
leave
her
state
and
home
to
follow
his
poor
fortune
,
be
put
aboard
ship
with
everything
necessary
for
their
comfort
and
protection
,
and
sail
for
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
irish
people
have
have
enough
of
counterfeit
Earls
of
Warwick
and
Dukes
of
York
,
for
one
while
;
and
would
give
the
White
Rose
no
aid
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
White
Rose
---
encircle
by
thorn
indeed
---
resolve
to
go
with
his
beautiful
wife
to
Cornwall
as
a
forlorn
resource
,
and
see
what
may
be
make
of
the
cornish
man
,
who
have
rise
so
valiantly
a
little
while
before
,
and
who
have
fight
so
bravely
at
Deptford
Bridge
.
  
<EOS>
to
Whitsand
Bay
,
in
Cornwall
,
accordingly
,
come
Perkin
Warbeck
and
his
wife
;
and
the
lovely
lady
he
shut
up
for
safety
in
the
Castle
of
St
Michael
's
Mount
,
and
then
march
into
Devonshire
at
the
head
of
three
thousand
Cornishmen
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
increase
to
six
thousand
by
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
Exeter
;
but
,
there
the
people
make
a
stout
resistance
,
and
he
go
on
to
Taunton
,
where
he
come
in
sight
of
the
King
's
army
.
 
<EOS>
the
stout
cornish
man
,
although
they
be
few
in
number
,
and
badly
armed
,
be
so
bold
,
that
they
never
think
of
retreat
;
but
bravely
look
forward
to
a
battle
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
unhappily
for
them
,
the
man
who
be
possess
of
so
many
engaging
quality
,
and
who
attract
so
many
people
to
his
side
when
he
have
nothing
else
with
which
to
tempt
them
,
be
not
as
brave
as
they
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
night
,
when
the
two
army
lie
opposite
to
each
other
,
he
mount
a
swift
horse
and
flee
.
 
<EOS>
when
morning
dawn
,
the
poor
confide
cornish
man
,
discover
that
they
have
no
leader
,
surrender
to
the
King
's
power
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
hang
,
and
the
rest
be
pardon
and
go
miserably
home
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
King
pursue
Perkin
Warbeck
to
the
sanctuary
of
Beaulieu
in
the
New
Forest
,
where
it
be
soon
know
that
he
have
take
refuge
,
he
send
a
body
of
horseman
to
St
Michael
's
Mount
,
to
seize
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
soon
take
and
bring
as
a
captive
before
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
beautiful
,
and
so
good
,
and
so
devoted
to
the
man
in
whom
she
believe
,
that
the
King
regard
her
with
compassion
,
treat
her
with
great
respect
,
and
place
her
at
Court
,
near
the
Queen
's
person
.
 
<EOS>
and
many
year
after
Perkin
Warbeck
be
no
more
,
and
when
his
strange
story
have
become
like
a
nursery
tale
,
SHE
be
call
the
White
Rose
,
by
the
people
,
in
remembrance
of
her
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
the
sanctuary
at
Beaulieu
be
soon
surround
by
the
King
's
man
;
and
the
King
,
pursue
his
usual
dark
,
artful
way
,
send
pretended
friend
to
Perkin
Warbeck
to
persuade
him
to
come
out
and
surrender
himself
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
soon
do
;
the
King
have
take
a
good
look
at
the
man
of
whom
he
have
hear
so
much
---
from
behind
a
screen
---
direct
him
to
be
well
mounted
,
and
to
ride
behind
him
at
a
little
distance
,
guard
,
but
not
bind
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
enter
London
with
the
King
's
favourite
show
---
a
procession
;
and
some
of
the
people
hoot
as
the
Pretender
ride
slowly
through
the
street
to
the
Tower
;
but
the
great
part
be
quiet
,
and
very
curious
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
Tower
,
he
be
take
to
the
Palace
at
Westminster
,
and
there
lodge
like
a
gentleman
,
though
closely
watch
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
examine
every
now
and
then
as
to
his
imposture
;
but
the
King
be
so
secret
in
all
he
do
,
that
even
then
he
give
it
a
consequence
,
which
it
can
not
be
suppose
to
have
in
itself
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Perkin
Warbeck
run
away
,
and
take
refuge
in
another
sanctuary
near
Richmond
in
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
he
be
again
persuade
to
deliver
himself
up
;
and
,
be
convey
to
London
,
he
stand
in
the
stock
for
a
whole
day
,
outside
Westminster
Hall
,
and
there
read
a
paper
purporting
to
be
his
full
confession
,
and
relate
his
history
as
the
King
's
agent
have
originally
describe
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
then
shut
up
in
the
Tower
again
,
in
the
company
of
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
who
have
now
be
there
for
fourteen
year
:
 
ever
since
his
removal
out
of
Yorkshire
,
except
when
the
King
have
have
him
at
court
,
and
have
show
him
to
the
people
,
to
prove
the
imposture
of
the
Baker
's
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
too
probable
,
when
we
consider
the
crafty
character
of
Henry
the
Seventh
,
that
these
two
be
bring
together
for
a
cruel
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
a
plot
be
soon
discover
between
them
and
the
keepers
,
to
murder
the
Governor
,
get
possession
of
the
key
,
and
proclaim
Perkin
Warbeck
as
King
Richard
the
Fourth
.
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
some
such
plot
,
be
likely
;
that
they
be
tempt
into
it
,
<EOS>
be
at
least
as
likely
;
that
the
unfortunate
Earl
of
Warwick
---
last
male
of
the
plantagenet
line
---
be
too
unused
to
the
world
,
and
too
ignorant
and
simple
to
know
much
about
it
,
whatever
it
be
,
be
perfectly
certain
;
and
that
it
be
the
King
's
interest
to
get
rid

if
he

honest

he
may
have
live
a

but
he
always
contrive
so
as
never

in
reality
,
and
always
to
make
money

<EOS>
His
taxation
of
the

on
pretence
of
war
with
France
,
involve
,
at
one

,
a
very
dangerous

as
soon

that
the
fortune
of
the
Spanish
Princess
,
amount
to
two
hundred
thousand
crown
,
should
go
out

then
twelve
year
of

when
he
too

<EOS>
there
be
objection
to
this
marriage
on
the
part
of
the
clergy

but
,
as
the
infallible
Pope

his

to

however
practicable
it
may
have
be
to
gain
the

he
give
up
the
idea

<EOS>
He
be
not
so
fond
of
her
but
that
he
soon
propose
to
marry
the
Dowager
Duchess
of
Savoy

He

It

in
this
reign
that
the
great
CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS

on

Spain

discover
what
be

<EOS>
great
wonder

interest

hope
of
wealth
be
awaken
in
England
<EOS>
thereby
,
the
King

the
merchant
of
London

Bristol
fit
out
an
english
expedition
for
further
discovery
in
the
New

,
and
entrust
it
to
SEBASTIAN
CABOT

the

<EOS>
He

both
for

<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Eighth

call
Bluff
King
Hal
and
Burly
King
Harry
Part
<EOS>
the
first
    
we
now
come
to
King
Henry
the
Eighth
,
whom
it
have
be
too
much
the
fashion
to
call
"
Bluff
King
Hal
,
"
and
"
Burly
King
Harry
,
"
and
other
fine
name
;
but
whom
<EOS>
I
shall
take
the
liberty
to
call
,
plainly
,
one
of
the
most
detestable
villain
that
ever
draw
breath
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
judge
,
long
before
we
come
to
the
end
of
his
life
,
whether
he
deserve
the
character
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
just
eighteen
year
of
age
when
he
come
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
People
say
he
be
handsome
then
;
but
I
do
not
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
big
,
burly
,
noisy
,
small
-
eyed
,
large
-
faced
,
double
-
chinned
,
swinish
-
look
fellow
in
later
life
(
as
we
know
from
the
likeness
of
him
,
paint
by
the
famous
HANS
HOLBEIN
)
,
and
it
be
not
easy
to
believe
that
so
bad
a
character
can
ever
have
be
veil
under
a
prepossessing
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
to
make
himself
popular
;
and
the
people
,
who
have
long
dislike
the
late
King
,
be
very
willing
to
believe
that
he
deserve
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
fond
of
show
and
display
,
and
so
be
they
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
there
be
great
rejoicing
when
he
marry
the
Princess
Catherine
,
and
when
they
be
both
crown
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
King
fight
at
tournament
and
always
come
off
victorious
---
for
the
courtier
take
care
of
that
---
and
there
be
a
general
outcry
that
he
be
a
wonderful
man
.
 
<EOS>
Empson
,
Dudley
,
and
their
supporter
be
accuse
of
a
variety
of
crime
they
have
never
commit
,
instead
of
the
offence
of
which
they
really
have
be
guilty
;
and
they
be
pillory
,
and
set
upon
horse
with
their
face
to
the
tail
,
and
knock
about
and
behead
,
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
,
and
the
enrichment
of
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
the
Pope
,
so
indefatigable
in
get
the
world
into
trouble
,
have
mix
himself
up
in
a
war
on
the
continent
of
Europe
,
occasion
by
the
reign
prince
of
little
quarrelling
state
in
Italy
<EOS>
have
at
various
time
marry
into
other
royal
family
,
and
so
lead
to
THEIR
claim
a
share
in
those
petty
government
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
who
discover
that
he
be
very
fond
of
the
Pope
,
send
a
herald
to
the
King
of
France
,
to
say
that
he
must
not
make
war
upon
that
holy
personage
,
because
he
be
the
father
of
all
Christians
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
french
King
do
not
mind
this
relationship
in
the
least
,
and
also
refuse
to
admit
a
claim
King
Henry
make
to
certain
land
in
France
,
war
be
declare
between
the
two
country
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
perplex
this
story
with
an
account
of
the
trick
and
design
of
all
the
sovereign
who
be
engage
in
it
,
it
be
enough
to
say
that
England
make
a
blunder
alliance
with
Spain
,
and
get
stupidly
take
in
by
that
country
;
which
make
its
own
term
with
France
when
it
could
and
leave
England
in
the
lurch

<EOS>
SIR
EDWARD
HOWARD
,
a
bold
admiral
,
son
of
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
distinguish
himself
by
his
bravery
against
the
French
in
this
business
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
he
be
more
brave
than
wise
,
for
,
skim
into
the
french
harbour
of
Brest
with
only
a
few
row
-
boat
<EOS>
,
he
attempt
(
in
revenge
for
the
defeat
and
death
of
SIR
THOMAS
KNYVETT
,
another
bold
english
admiral
)
to
take
some
strong
french
ship
,
well
defend
with
battery
of
cannon
.
 
<EOS>
the
upshot
be
,
that
he
be
leave
on
board
of
one
of
them
(
in
consequence
of
its
shooting
away
from
his
own
boat
)
,
with
not
more
than
about
a
dozen
man
,
and
be
throw
into
the
sea
and
drown

though
not
until
he
have
take
from
his
breast
his
gold
chain
and
gold
whistle
,
which
be
the
sign
of
his
office
,
and
have
cast
them
into
the
sea
to
prevent
their
be
make
a
boast
of
by
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
defeat
---
which
be
a
great
one
,
for
Sir
Edward
Howard
be
a
man
of
valour
and
fame
---
the
King
take
it
into
his
head
to
invade
France
in
person
;
first
execute
that
dangerous
Earl
of
Suffolk
whom
his
father
have
leave
in
the
Tower
,
and
appoint
Queen
Catherine
to
the
charge
of
his
kingdom
in
his
absence

<EOS>
He
sail
to
Calais
,
where
he

join
by
MAXIMILIAN
,
Emperor
of
Germany
,
who
pretend
to
be
his
soldier
,
and
who
take
pay
in
his
service
:
 
with
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
of
that
sort
,
flattering
enough
to
the
vanity
of
a
vain
blusterer
.
<EOS>
the
King
may
be
successful
enough
in
sham
fight
;
but
his
idea
of
real
battle
chiefly
consist
in
pitching
silken
tent
of
bright
colour
that
be
ignominiously
blow
down
by
the
wind
,
and
in
make
a
vast
display
of
gaudy
flag
and
golden
curtain
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune

however

favour
him
better
than
he
deserve

for
,
after
much
waste
of
time
in
tent
pitching
,
flag
flying
,
gold
curtaining
,
and
other
such
masquerading
,
he
give
the
french
battle
at
a
place
call
Guinegate
:
 
where
they
take
such
an
unaccountable
panic
,
and
flee
with
such
swiftness
,
that
it
be
ever
afterwards
call
by
the
English
the
Battle
of
Spurs
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
follow
up
his
advantage
,
the
King
,
find
that
he
have
have
enough
of
real
fighting
,
come
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
scottish
King
,
though
nearly
relate

have
take

in

the

the
english
general

advance
to

him
when
he
come
out
of

the

another
when
the
Scottish

along

the

up
in
five
great

then

so
they

come
on
in

long
line

at

they

the
good
of
it

but
the
English
recover
themselves
so
bravely

and

with
such
valour

that

when

number

<EOS>
for
a
long
time
afterwards
,
the
scottish
peasantry
use
to
believe
that
their
King
have
not
be
really
kill
in
this
battle
,
because
no
Englishman
have
find
an
iron
belt
he
wear
about
his
body
as
a
penance
for
have
be
an
unnatural
and
undutiful

but

whatever
become
of
his
belt
,
the
English
have
his
sword
and
dagger
,
and
the
ring
from
his
finger
,
and
his
body
too
,
cover
with
wound

<EOS>
there
be
no

it
;
for
it
be
see

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
in

interest
with
the
King

the
Duke

Suffolk
have
address
his
most
powerful
favourite
and
adviser
,
THOMAS
WOLSEY
---
a
name
very
famous

<EOS>
Wolsey

make
a

of
the
great
Cardinal
Wolsey
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
gay
man
,
who
could
dance
and
jest
,
and
sing
and
drink
;
and
those
be
the
road
to
so
much
,
or
rather
so
little
,
of
a
heart
as
King
Henry
have
.
 
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
this
kind

<EOS>
for
many
such
reason

and
,
be
a

or
any

<EOS>
CHARLES
,
the
new
Emperor
of
Germany
(
the
old

be
dead

,
want
to
prevent
too
cordial
an
alliance

and
come

England
before
the

,
besides

secure
Wolsey

<EOS>
on

day
when

the
King
and
all
the
Court
go
over
to
Calais

and
thence
to
the
place
of
meeting

between
Ardres

commonly
call

the
Cloth

Gold

<EOS>
here
,
all
manner
of
expense
and
prodigality
be
lavish
on
the
decoration
of
the
show
;
many
of
the
knight
and
gentleman
be
so
superbly
dressed
that
it
be
say
they
carry
their
whole
estate
upon
their
shoulder

<EOS>
there
be
sham
castle

temporary

fountain
run

great

full

and
such

in

of
all
,
the
rich
Cardinal
out

shone
and
out

glitter
all
the
nobleman
and
gentleman
assemble

<EOS>
after
a
treaty
make
between
the
two
king
with
as
much
solemnity
as
if
they
have
intend
to
keep
it
,
the
list
---
nine
hundred
foot
long
,
and
three
hundred
and
twenty

---
be
open
for
the
tournament
;
the
Queens
of
France
and
England
look
on
with
great
array
of
lord
and
lady
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
for
ten
day
,
the
two
sovereign
fight
five
combat
every
day
,
and
always
beat
their
polite
adversary
;
though
they
do
write
that
the
King
of
England
,
be
throw
in
a
wrestle
one
day
by
the
King
of
France
,
lose
his
kingly
temper
with
his
brother
-
in
-
arm
,
and
want
to
make
a
quarrel
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
great
story
belong
to
this
field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
,
show
how
the
English
be
distrustful
of
the
French
,
and
the
French
of
the
English
,
until
Francis
ride
alone
one
morning
to
Henry
's
tent
;
and
,
go
in
before
he
be
out
of
bed
,
tell
him
in
joke
that
he
be
his
prisoner
;
and
how
Henry
jump
out
of
bed
and
embrace
Francis
;
and
how
Francis
help
Henry
to
dress
,
and
warm
his
linen
for
him
;
and
how
Henry
give
Francis
a
splendid
jewel
collar
,
and
how
Francis
give
Henry
,
in
return
,
a
costly
bracelet
.
<EOS>
all
this
and
a
great
deal
more
be
so
write
about
,
and
sing
about
,
and
talk
about
at
that
time
(
and
,
indeed
,
since
that
time
too
)
,
that
the
world
have
have
good
cause
to
be
sick
of
it
,
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
nothing
come
of
all
these
fine
doing
but
a
speedy
renewal
of
the
war
between
England
and
France
,
in
which
the
two
royal
companion
and
brother
in
arm
long
very
earnestly
to
damage
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
before
it
break
out
again
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
be
shamefully
execute
on
Tower
Hill
,
on
the
evidence
of
a
discharge
servant
---
really
for
nothing
,
except
the
folly
of
have
believe
in
a
friar
of
the
name
of
HOPKINS
,
who
have
pretend
to
be
a
prophet
,
and
who
have
mumble
and
jumble
out
some
nonsense
about
the
Duke
's
son
be
destine
to
be
very
great
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
believe
that
the
unfortunate
Duke
have
give
offence
to
the
great
Cardinal
by
express
his
mind
freely
about
the
expense
and
absurdity
of
the
whole
business
of
the
field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
be
behead
,
as
I
have
say
,
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
people
who
see
it
do
be
very
angry
,
and
cry
out
that
it
be
the
work
of
"
the
butcher
's
son
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
new
war
be
a
short
one
,
though
the
Earl
of
Surrey
invade
France
again
,
and
do
some
injury
to
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
It
end
in
another
treaty
of
peace
between
the
two
kingdom
,
and
in
the
discovery
that
the
Emperor
of
Germany
be
not
such
a
good
friend
to
England
in
reality
,
as
he
pretend
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
he
keep
his
promise
to
Wolsey
to
make
him
Pope
,
though
the
King
urge
him
.
 
<EOS>
two
Popes
die
in
pretty
quick
succession
;
but
the
foreign
priest
be
too
much
for
the
Cardinal
,
and
keep
him
out
of
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
Cardinal
and
King
together
find
out
that
the
Emperor
of
Germany
be
not
a
man
to
keep
faith
with
;
break
off
a
project
marriage
between
the
King
's
daughter
MARY
,
Princess
of
Wales
,
and
that
sovereign
;
and
begin
to
consider
whether
it
may
not
be
well
to
marry
the
young
lady
,
either
to
Francis
himself
,
or
to
his
eld
son
.
  
<EOS>
there
now
arise
at
Wittemberg
,
in
Germany
,
the
great
leader
of
the
mighty
change
in
England
which
be
call
the
Reformation
,
and
which
set
the
people
free
from
their
slavery
to
the
priest
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
learn
doctor
,
name
MARTIN
LUTHER
,
who
know
all
about
them
,
for
he
have
be
a
priest
,
and
even
a
monk
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
preaching
and
writing
of
Wickliffe
have
set
a
number
of
man
think
on
this
subject
;
and
Luther
,
find
one
day
to
his
great
surprise
,
that
there
really
be
a
book
call
the
New
Testament
which
the
priest
do
not
allow
to
be
read
,
and
which
contain
truth
that
they
suppress
,
begin
to
be
very
vigorous
against
the
whole
body
,
from
the
Pope
downward
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
,
while
he
be
yet
only
begin
his
vast
work
of
awaken
the
nation
,
that
an
impudent
fellow
name
TETZEL
,
a
friar
of
very
bad
character
,
come
into
his
neighbourhood
sell
what
be
call
Indulgences
,
by
wholesale
,
to
raise
money
for
beautify
the
great
Cathedral
of
St
Peter
's
,
at
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
whoever
buy
an
indulgence
of
the
Pope
be
suppose
to
buy
himself
off
from
the
punishment
of
Heaven
for
his
offence
.
<EOS>
Luther
tell
the
people
that
these
indulgence
be
worthless
bit
of
paper
,
before
God
,
and
that
Tetzel
and
his
master
be
a
crew
of
impostor
in
sell
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
and
the
Cardinal
be
mightily
indignant
at
this
presumption
;
and
the
King
(
with
the
help
of
SIR
THOMAS
MORE
,
a
wise
man
,
whom
he
afterwards
repay
by
strike
off
his
head
)
even
write
a
book
about
it
,
with
which
the
Pope
be
so
well
pleased
that
he
give
the
King
the
title
of
Defender
of
the
Faith
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
and
the
Cardinal
also
issue
flame
warning
to
the
people
not
to
read
Luther
's
book
,
on
pain
of
excommunication
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
do
read
them
for
all
that
;
and
the
rumour
of
what
be
in
them
spread
far
and
wide
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
great
change
be
thus
go
on
,
the
King
begin
to
show
himself
in
his
true
and
bad
colour
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
,
the
pretty
little
girl
who
have
go
abroad
to
France
with
his
sister
,
be
by
this
time
grow
up
to
be
very
beautiful
,
and
be
one
of
the
lady
in
attendance
on
Queen
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Queen
Catherine
be
no
longer
young
or
handsome
,
and
it
be
likely
that
she
be
not
particularly
good
-
tempered
;
have
be
always
rather
melancholy
,
and
have
be
make
more
so
by
the
death
of
four
of
her
child
when
they
be
very
young
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
King
fall
in
love
with
the
fair
Anne
Boleyn
,
and
say
to
himself
,
"
how
can
I
be
best
rid
of
my
own
troublesome
wife
whom
I
be
tired
of
,
and
marry
Anne
?
"
  
<EOS>
You
recollect
that
Queen
Catherine
have
be
the
wife
of
Henry
's
brother
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
the
King
do
,
after
think
it
over
,
but
call
his
favourite
priest
about
him
,
and
say
,
o
!
<EOS>
his
mind
be
in
such
a
dreadful
state
,
and
he
be
so
frightfully
uneasy
,
because
he
be
afraid
it
be
not
lawful
for
him
to
marry
the
Queen
!
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
those
priest
have
the
courage
to
hint
that
it
be
rather
curious
he
have
never
think
of
that
before
,
and
that
his
mind
seem
to
have
be
in
a
tolerably
jolly
condition
during
a
great
many
year
,
in
which
he
certainly
have
not
fret
himself
thin
;
but
,
they
all
say
,
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
very
true
,
and
it
be
a
serious
business
;
and
perhaps
the
good
way
to
make
it
right
,
would
be
for
his
Majesty
to
be
divorce
!
 
<EOS>
the
King
reply
,
yes
,
he
think
that
would
be
the
good
way
,
certainly
;
so
they
all
go
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
relate
to
you
the
intrigue
and
plot
that
take
place
in
the
endeavour
to
get
this
divorce
,
you
would
think
the
history
of
England
the
most
tiresome
book
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
shall
say
no
more
,
than
that
after
a
vast
deal
of
negotiation
and
evasion
,
the
Pope
issue
a
commission
to
Cardinal
Wolsey
and
CARDINAL
CAMPEGGIO
(
whom
he
send
over
from
Italy
for
the
purpose
)
,
to
try
the
whole
case
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
---
and
I
think
with
reason
---
that
Wolsey
be
the
Queen
's
enemy
,
because
she
have
reprove
him
for
his
proud
and
gorgeous
manner
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
do
not
at
first
know
that
the
King
want
to
marry
Anne
Boleyn
;
and
when
he
do
know
it
,
he
even
go
down
on
his
knee
,
in
the
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Cardinals
open
their
court
in
the
Convent
of
the
Black
Friars
,
near
to
where
the
bridge
of
that
name
in
London
now
stand
;
and
the
King
and
Queen
,
that
they
may
be
near
it
,
take
up
their
lodging
at
the
adjoining
palace
of
Bridewell
,
of
which
nothing
now
remain
but
a
bad
prison
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
opening
of
the
court
,
when
the
King
and
Queen
be
call
on
to
appear
,
that
poor
ill
-
use
lady
,
with
a
dignity
and
firmness
and
yet
with
a
womanly
affection
worthy
to
be
always
admire
,
go
and
kneel
at
the
King
's
foot
,
and
say
that
she
have
come
,
a
stranger
,
to
his
dominion
;
that
she
have
be
a
good
and
true
wife
to
him
for
twenty
year
;
and
that
she
could
acknowledge
no
power
in
those
cardinal
to
try
whether
she
should
be
consider
his
wife
after
all
that
time
,
or
should
be
put
away
.
<EOS>
with
that
,
she
get
up
and
leave
the
court
,
and
would
never
afterwards
come
back
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
pretend
to
be
very
much
overcome
,
and
say
,
o
!
<EOS>
my
lord
and
gentleman
,
what
a
good
woman
she
be
to
be
sure
,
and
how
delighted
he
would
be
to
live
with
her
unto
death
,
but
for
that
terrible
uneasiness
in
his
mind
which
be
quite
wear
him
away
!
<EOS>
so
,
the
case
go
on
,
and
there
be
nothing
but
talk
for
two
month
.
 
<EOS>
then
Cardinal
Campeggio
,
who
,
on
behalf
of
the
Pope
,
want
nothing
so
much
as
delay
,
adjourn
it
for
two
more
month
;
and
before
that
time
be
elapse
,
the
Pope
himself
adjourn
it
indefinitely
,
by
require
the
King
and
Queen
to
come
to
Rome
and
have
it
try
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
good
luck
for
the
King
,
word
be
bring
to
him
by
some
of
his
people
,
that
they
have
happen
to
meet
at
supper
,
THOMAS
CRANMER
,
a
learn
Doctor
of
Cambridge
,
who
have
propose
to
urge
the
Pope
on
,
by
refer
the
case
to
all
the
learn
doctor
and
bishop
,
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
and
get
their
opinion
that
the
King
's
marriage
be
unlawful
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
who
be
now
in
a
hurry
to
marry
Anne
Boleyn
,
think
this
such
a
good
idea
,
that
he
send
for
Cranmer
,
post
haste
,
and
say
to
LORD
rochfort
,
Anne
Boleyn
's
father
,
"
take
this
learn
doctor
down
to
your
country
-
house
,
and
there
let
him
have
a
good
room
for
a
study
,
and
no
end
of
book
out
of
which
to
prove
that
I
may
marry
your
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rochfort
,
not
at
all
reluctant
,
make
the
learned
Doctor
as
comfortable
as
he
could
;
and
the
learned
doctor
go
to
work
to
prove
his
case
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
the
King
and
Anne
Boleyn
be
write
letter
to
one
another
almost
daily
,
full
of
impatience
to
have
the
case
settle
;
and
Anne
Boleyn
be
show
herself
(
as
I
think
)
very
worthy
of
the
fate
which
afterwards
befel
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
bad
for
Cardinal
Wolsey
that
he
have
leave
Cranmer
to
render
this
help
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bad
for
him
that
he
have
try
to
dissuade
the
king
from
marry
Anne
Boleyn
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
servant
as
he
,
to
such
a
master
as
Henry
,
would
probably
have
fall
in
any
case
;
but
,
between
the
hatred
of
the
party
of
the
Queen
that
be
,
and
the
hatred
of
the
party
of
the
Queen
that
be
to
be
,
he
fall
suddenly
and
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
go
down
one
day
to
the
Court
of
Chancery
,
where
he
now
preside
,
he
be
wait
upon
by
the
duke
of
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
,
who
tell
him
that
they
bring
an
order
to
him
to
resign
that
office
,
and
to
withdraw
quietly
to
a
house
he
have
at
Esher
,
in
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
the
Cardinal
refusing
,
they
ride
off
to
the
King
;
and
next
day
come
back
with
a
letter
from
him
,
on
read
which
,
the
Cardinal
submit
.
 
<EOS>
an
inventory
be
make
out
of
all
the
rich
in
his
palace
at
York
Place
(
now
Whitehall
)
,
and
he
go
sorrowfully
up
the
river
,
in
his
barge
,
to
Putney
.
 
<EOS>
an
abject
man
he
be
,
in
spite
of
his
pride
;
for
be
overtaken
,
ride
out
of
that
place
towards
Esher
,
by
one
of
the
King
's
chamberlain
who
bring
him
a
kind
message
and
a
ring
,
he
alight
from
his
mule
,
take
off
his
cap
,
and
kneel
down
in
the
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
His
poor
Fool
,
whom
in
his
prosperous
day
he
have
always
keep
in
his
palace
to
entertain
him
,
cut
a
far
well
figure
than
he
;
for
,
when
the
Cardinal
say
to
the
chamberlain
that
he
have
nothing
to
send
to
his
lord
the
King
as
a
present
,
but
that
jester
who
be
a
most
excellent
one
,
it
take
six
strong
yeoman
to
remove
the
faithful
fool
from
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
the
once
proud
Cardinal
be
soon
further
disgrace
,
and
write
the
most
abject
letter
to
his
vile
sovereign
;
who
humble
him
one
day
and
encourage
him
the
next
,
accord
to
his
humour
,
until
he
be
at
last
order
to
go
and
reside
in
his
diocese
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
too
poor
;
but
I
do
not
know
how
he
make
that
out
,
for
he
take
a
hundred
and
sixty
servant
with
him
,
and
seventy
-
two
cart
-
load
of
furniture
,
food
,
and
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
in
that
part
of
the
country
for
the
good
part
of
a
year
,
and
show
himself
so
improve
by
his
misfortune
,
and
be
so
mild
and
so
conciliating
,
that
he
win
all
heart
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
even
in
his
proud
day
,
he
have
do
some
magnificent
thing
for
learning
and
education
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
be
arrest
for
high
treason
;
and
,
come
slowly
on
his
journey
towards
London
,
get
as
far
as
Leicester
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
at
Leicester
Abbey
after
dark
,
and
very
ill
,
he
say
---
when
the
monk
come
out
at
the
gate
with
light
torch
to
receive
him
---
that
he
have
come
to
lay
his
bone
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
indeed
;
for
he
be
take
to
a
bed
,
from
which
he
never
rise
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
last
word
be
,
"
have
I
but
serve
God
as
diligently
as
I
have
serve
the
king
,
He
would
not
have
give
me
over
,
in
my
grey
hair
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
this
be
my
just
reward
for
my
pain
and
diligence
,
not
regard
my
service
to
God
,
but
only
my
duty
to
my
prince
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
news
of
his
death
be
quickly
carry
to
the
King
,
who
be
amuse
himself
with
archery
in
the
garden
of
the
magnificent
Palace
at
Hampton
Court
,
which
that
very
Wolsey
have
present
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
emotion
his
royal
mind
display
at
the
loss
of
a
servant
<EOS>
so
faithful
and
so
ruin
,
be
a
particular
desire
to
lay
hold
of
fifteen
hundred
pound
which
the
Cardinal
be
report
to
have
hide
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
the
opinion
concern
the
divorce
,
of
the
learn
doctor
and
bishop
and
other
,
be
at
last
collect
,
and
be
generally
in
the
King
's
favour
,
be
forward
to
the
Pope
,
with
an
entreaty
that
he
would
now
grant
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Pope
,
who
be
a
timid
man
,
be
half
distract
between
his
fear
of
his
authority
be
set
aside
in
England
if
he
do
not
do
as
he
be
ask
,
and
his
dread
of
offend
the
Emperor
of
Germany
,
who
be
Queen
Catherine
's
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
mind
he
still
evade
and
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
THOMAS
CROMWELL
,
who
have
be
one
of
Wolsey
's
faithful
attendant
,
and
have
remain
so
even
in
his
decline
,
advise
the
King
to
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hand
,
and
make
himself
the
head
of
the
whole
Church
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
the
King
by
various
artful
mean
,
begin
to
do
;
but
he
recompense
the
clergy
by
allow
them
to
burn
as
many
people
as
they
please
,
for
hold
Luther
's
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
understand
that
Sir
Thomas
More
,
the
wise
man
who
have
help
the
King
with
his
book
,
have
be
make
Chancellor
in
Wolsey
's
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
be
truly
attach
to
the
Church
as
it
be
even
in
its
abuse
,
he
,
in
this
state
of
thing
,
resign
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
quite
resolve
to
get
rid
of
Queen
Catherine
,
and
to
marry
Anne
Boleyn
without
more
ado
,
the
King
make
Cranmer
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
direct
Queen
Catherine
to
leave
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
She
obey
;
but
reply
that
wherever
she
go
,
she
be
Queen
of
England
still
,
and
would
remain
so
,
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
then
marry
Anne
Boleyn
privately
;
and
the
new
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
within
half
a
year
,
declare
his
marriage
with
Queen
Catherine
void
,
and
crown
Anne
Boleyn
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
She
may
have
know
that
no
good
could
ever
come
from
such
wrong
,
and
that
the
corpulent
brute
who
have
be
so
faithless
and
so
cruel
to
his
first
wife
,
could
be
more
faithless
and
more
cruel
to
his
second
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
have
know
that
,
even
when
he
be
in
love
with
her
,
he
have
be
a
mean
and
selfish
coward
,
run
away
,
like
a
frightened
cur
,
from
her
society
and
her
house
,
when
a
dangerous
sickness
break
out
in
it
,
and
when
she
may
easily
have
take
it
and
die
,
as
several
of
the
household
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Anne
Boleyn
arrive
at
all
this
knowledge
too
late
,
and
buy
it
at
a
dear
price
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bad
marriage
with
a
bad
man
come
to
its
natural
end
.
<EOS>
Its
natural
end
be
not
,
as
we
shall
too
soon
see
,
a
natural
death
for
her
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Eighth
Part
<EOS>
the
second
    
the
Pope
be
throw
into
a
very
angry
state
of
mind
when
he
hear
of
the
King
's
marriage
,
and
fume
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
english
monk
and
friar
,
see
that
their
order
be
in
danger
,
do
the
same
;
some
even
declaim
against
the
King
in
church
before
his
face
,
and
be
not
to
be
stop
until
he
himself
roar
out
"
Silence
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
not
much
the
bad
for
this
,
take
it
pretty
quietly
;
and
be
very
glad
when
his
Queen
give
birth
to
a
daughter
,
who
be
christen
ELIZABETH
,
and
declare
Princess
of
Wales
as
her
sister
Mary
have
already
be
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
atrocious
feature
of
this
reign
be
that
Henry
the
Eighth
be
always
trim
between
the
reform
religion
and
the
unreformed
one
;
so
that
the
more
he
quarrel
with
the
Pope
,
the
more
of
his
own
subject
he
roast
alive
for
not
hold
the
Pope
's
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
an
unfortunate
student
name
John
Frith
,
and
a
poor
simple
tailor
name
Andrew
Hewet
who
love
him
very
much
,
and
say
that
whatever
John
Frith
believe
he
believe
,
be
burn
in
Smithfield
---
to
show
what
a
capital
<EOS>
Christian
the
King
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
these
be
speedily
follow
by
two
much
great
victim
,
Sir
Thomas
More
,
and
John
Fisher
,
the
Bishop
of
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
,
who
be
a
good
and
amiable
old
man
,
have
commit
no
great
offence
than
believe
in
Elizabeth
Barton
,
call
the
Maid
of
Kent
---
another
of
those
ridiculous
woman
who
pretend
to
be
inspire
,
and
to
make
all
sort
of
heavenly
revelation
,
though
they
indeed
utter
nothing
but
evil
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
offence
---
as
it
be
pretend
,
but
really
for
deny
the
King
to
be
the
supreme
Head
of
the
Church
---
he
get
into
trouble
,
and
be
put
in
prison
;
but
,
even
then
,
he
may
have
be
suffer
to
die
naturally
(
short
work
have
be
make
of
execute
the
Kentish
Maid
and
her
principal
follower
)
,
but
that
the
Pope
,
to
spite
the
King
,
resolve
to
make
him
a
cardinal
.
 
<EOS>
upon
that
the
King
make
a
ferocious
joke
to
the
effect
that
the
Pope
may
send
Fisher
a
red
hat
---
which
be
the
way
they
make
a
cardinal
---
but
he
should
have
no
head
on
which
to
wear
it
;
and
he
be
try
with
all
unfairness
and
injustice
,
and
sentence
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
die
like
a
noble
and
virtuous
old
man
,
and
leave
a
worthy
name
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
suppose
,
I
dare
say
,
that
Sir
Thomas
More
would
be
frighten
by
this
example
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
be
not
to
be
easily
terrify
,
and
,
thoroughly
believe
in
the
Pope
,
have
make
up
his
mind
that
the
King
be
not
the
rightful
Head
of
the
Church
,
he
positively
refuse
to
say
that
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
crime
he
too
be
try
and
sentence
,
after
have
be
in
prison
a
whole
year
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
doom
to
death
,
and
come
away
from
his
trial
with
the
edge
of
the
executioner
's
axe
<EOS>
turn
towards
him
---
as
be
always
do
in
those
time
when
a
state
prisoner
come
to
that
hopeless
pass
<EOS>
---
he
bear
it
quite
serenely
,
and
give
his
blessing
to
his
son
,
who
press
through
the
crowd
in
Westminster
Hall
and
kneel
down
to
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
get
to
the
Tower
Wharf
on
his
way
back
to
his
prison
,
and
his
favourite
daughter
,
MARGARET
ROPER
,
a
very
good
woman
,
rush
through
the
guard
again
and
again
,
to
kiss
him
and
to
weep
upon
his
neck
,
he
be
overcome
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
recover
,
and
never
more
show
any
feeling
but
cheerfulness
and
courage
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
up
the
step
of
the
scaffold
to
his
death
,
he
say
jokingly
to
the
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
,
observe
that
they
be
weak
and
shake
beneath
his
tread
<EOS>
,
"
I
pray
you
,
master
Lieutenant
,
see
me
safe
up
;
and
,
for
my
come
down
,
I
can
shift
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
also
he
say
to
the
executioner
,
after
he
have
lay
his
head
upon
the
block
,
"
let
me
put
my
beard
out
of
the
way
;
for
that
,
at
least
,
have
never
commit
any
treason

"
<EOS>
then
his
head
be
strike
off
at
a
blow
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
execution
be
worthy
of
King
Henry
the
Eighth
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
More
be
one
of
the
most
virtuous
man
in
his
dominion
,
and
the
Bishop
be
one
of
his
old
and
true
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
be
a
friend
of
that
fellow
be
almost
as
dangerous
as
to
be
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
news
of
these
two
murder
get
to
Rome
,
the
Pope
rage
against
the
murderer
more
than
ever
<EOS>
Pope
rage
since
the
world
begin
,
and
prepare
a
Bull
,
order
his
subject
to
take
arm
against
him
and
dethrone
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
take
all
possible
precaution
to
keep
that
document
out
of
his
dominion
,
and
set
to
work
in
return
to
suppress
a
great
number
of
the
english
monastery
and
abbey
.
  
<EOS>
this
destruction
be
begin
by
a
body
of
commissioner
,
of
whom
Cromwell
(
whom
the
King
have
take
into
great
favour
)
be
the
head
;
and
be
carry
on
through
some
few
year
to
its
entire
completion
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
many
of
these
religious
establishment
be
religious
in
nothing
but
in
name
,
and
be
cram
with
lazy
,
indolent
,
and
sensual
monk
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
they
impose
upon
the
people
in
every
possible
way
;
that
they
have
<EOS>
image
move
by
wire
,
which
they
pretend
be
miraculously
move
by
Heaven
;
that
they
have
among
them
a
whole
tun
measure
full
of
tooth
,
all
purport
to
have
come
out
of
the
head
of
one
saint
,
who
must
indeed
have
be
a
very
extraordinary
person
with
that
enormous
allowance
of
grinder
;
that
they
have
bit
of
coal
which
they
say
have
fry
Saint
Lawrence
,
and
bit
of
toe
-
nail
which
they
say
belong
to
other
famous
saint
;
penknife
,
and
boot
,
and
girdle
,
which
they
say
belong
to
other
;
and
that
all
these
bit
of
rubbish
be
call
Relics
,
and
adore
by
the
ignorant
people
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
be
no
doubt
either
,
that
the
King
's
officer
and
man
punish
the
good
monk
with
the
bad
;
do
great
injustice
;
demolish
many
beautiful
thing
and
many
valuable
library
;
destroy
number
of
painting
,
stain
glass
window
,
fine
pavement
,
and
carving
;
and
that
the
whole
court
be
ravenously
greedy
and
rapacious
for
the
division
of
this
great
spoil
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
seem
to
have
grow
almost
mad
in
the
ardour
of
this
pursuit
;
for
he
declare
Thomas
a
Becket
a
traitor
,
though
he
have
be
dead
so
many
year
,
and
have
his
body
dig
up
out
of
his
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
as
miraculous
as
the
monk
pretend
,
if
they
have
tell
the
truth
,
for
he
be
find
with
one
head
on
his
shoulder
,
and
they
have
show
another
as
his
undoubted
and
genuine
head
ever
since
his
death
;
it
have
bring
them
vast
sum
of
money
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
the
gold
and
jewel
on
his
shrine
fill
two
great
chest
,
and
eight
man
totter
as
they
carry
them
away
.
<EOS>
how
rich
the
monastery
be
you
may
infer
from
the
fact
that
,
when
they
be
all
suppress
,
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
pound
a
year
---
in
those
day
an
immense
sum
---
come
to
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
be
not
do
without
cause
great
discontent
among
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
monk
have
be
good
landlord
and
hospitable
entertainer
of
all
traveller
,
and
have
be
accustom
to
give
away
a
great
deal
of
corn
,
and
fruit
,
and
meat
,
and
other
thing
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
it
be
difficult
to
change
good
into
money
,
in
consequence
of
the
road
be
very
few
and
very
bad
,
and
the
cart
,
and
waggon
of
the
bad
description
;
and
they
must
either
have
give
away
some
of
the
good
thing
they
possess
in
enormous
quantity
,
or
have
suffer
them
to
spoil
and
moulder
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
many
of
the
people
miss
what
it
be
more
agreeable
to
get
idly
than
to
work
for
;
and
the
monk
who
be
drive
out
of
their
home
and
wander
about
encourage
their
discontent
;
and
there
be
,
consequently
,
great
rising
in
Lincolnshire
and
Yorkshire
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
put
down
by
terrific
execution
,
from
which
the
monk
themselves
do
not
escape
,
and
the
King
go
on
grunt
and
growl
in
his
own
fat
way
,
like
a
royal
pig
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
tell
all
this
story
of
the
religious
house
at
one
time
,
to
make
it
plainer
,
and
to
get
back
to
the
King
's
domestic
affair
.
  
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Queen
Catherine
be
by
this
time
dead
;
and
the
King
be
by
this
time
as
tired
of
his
second
Queen
as
he
have
be
of
his
first
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
fall
in
love
with
Anne
when
she
be
in
the
service
of
Catherine
,
so
he
now
fall
in
love
with
another
lady
in
the
service
of
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
see
how
wicked
deed
be
punish
,
and
how
bitterly
and
self
-
reproachfully
the
Queen
must
now
have
think
of
her
own
rise
to
the
throne
!
 
<EOS>
the
new
fancy
be
a
lady
JANE
seymour
;
and
the
King
no
sooner
set
his
mind
on
her
,
than
he
resolve
to
have
Anne
Boleyn
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
bring
a
number
of
charge
against
Anne
,
accuse
her
of
dreadful
crime
which
she
have
never
commit
,
and
implicate
in
them
her
own
brother
and
certain
gentleman
in
her
service
:
 
among
whom
one
Norris
,
and
Mark
Smeaton
a
musician
,
be
best
remember
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
lord
and
councillor
be
as
afraid
of
the
King
and
as
subservient
to
him
as
the
mean
peasant
in
England
be
,
they
bring
in
Anne
Boleyn
guilty
,
and
the
other
unfortunate
person
accuse
with
her
,
guilty
too
.
 
<EOS>
those
gentleman
die
like
man
,
with
the
exception
of
Smeaton
,
who
have
be
tempt
by
the
King
into
tell
lie
,
which
he
call
confession
,
and
who
have
expect
to
be
pardon
;
but
who
,
I
be
very
glad
to
say
,
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
then
only
the
Queen
to
dispose
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
surround
in
the
Tower
with
woman
spy
;
have
be
monstrously
persecute
and
foully
slander
;
and
have
receive
no
justice
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
spirit
rise
with
her
affliction
;
and
,
after
have
in
vain
try
to
soften
the
King
by
write
an
affect
letter
to
him
which
still
exist
,
"
from
her
doleful
prison
in
the
Tower
,
"
she
resign
herself
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
to
those
about
her
,
very
cheerfully
,
that
she
have
hear
say
the
executioner
be
a
good
one
,
and
that
she
have
a
little
neck
(
she
laugh
and
clasp
it
with
her
hand
as
she
say
that
)
,
and
would
soon
be
out
of
her
pain
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
soon
out
of
her
pain
,
poor
creature
,
on
the
Green
inside
the
Tower
,
and
her
body
be
fling
into
an
old
box
and
put
away
in
the
ground
under
the
chapel
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
story
that
the
King
sit
in
his
palace
listen
very
anxiously
for
the
sound
of
the
cannon
which
be
to
announce
this
new
murder
;
and
that
,
when
he
hear
it
come
boom
on
the
air
,
he
rise
up
in
great
spirit
and
order
out
his
dog
to
go
a
-
hunting
.
<EOS>
He
be
bad
enough
to
do
it
;
but
whether
he
do
it
or
not
,
it
be
certain
that
he
marry
Jane
Seymour
the
very
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
pleasure
in
record
that
she
live
just
long
enough
to
give
birth
to
a
son
who
be
christen
EDWARD
,
and
then
to
die
of
a
fever
:
 
for
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
but
think
that
any
woman
who
marry
such
a
ruffian
,
and
know
what
innocent
blood
be
on
his
hand
,
deserve
the
axe
that
would
assuredly
have
fall
on
the
neck
of
Jane
Seymour
,
if
she
have
live
much
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Cranmer
have
do
what
he
could
to
save
some
of
the
Church
property
for
purpose
of
religion
and
education
;
but
,
the
great
family
have
be
so
hungry
to
get
hold
of
it
,
that
very
little
could
be
rescue
for
such
object
.
 
<EOS>
even
MILES
COVERDALE
,
who
do
the
people
the
inestimable
service
of
translate
the
Bible
into
English
(
which
the
unreformed
religion
never
permit
to
be
do
)
,
be
leave
in
poverty
while
the
great
family
clutch
the
Church
land
and
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
have
be
tell
that
when
the
Crown
come
into
possession
of
these
fund
,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
tax
them
;
but
they
be
tax
afresh
directly
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
for
them
,
indeed
,
that
so
many
noble
be
so
greedy
for
this
wealth
;
since
,
if
it
have
remain
with
the
Crown
,
there
may
have
be
no
end
to
tyranny
for
hundred
of
year
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
active
writer
on
the
Church
's
side
against
the
King
be
a
member
of
his
own
family
---
a
sort
of
distant
cousin
,
REGINALD
POLE
by
name
---
who
attack
him
in
the
most
violent
manner
(
though
he
receive
a
pension
from
him
all
the
time
)
,
and
fight
for
the
Church
with
his
pen
,
day
and
night
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
beyond
the
King
's
reach
---
be
in
Italy
---
the
King
politely
invite
him
over
to
discuss
the
subject
;
but
he
,
know
better
than
to
come
,
and
wisely
stay
where
he
be
,
the
King
's
rage
fall
upon
his
brother
Lord
Montague
,
the
Marquis
of
Exeter
,
and
some
other
gentleman
:
 
who
be
try
for
high
treason
in
correspond
with
him
and
aid
him
---
which
they
probably
do
---
and
be
all
execute
.
 
<EOS>
the
Pope
make
Reginald
Pole
a
cardinal
;
but
,
so
much
against
his
will
,
that
it
be
think
he
even
aspire
in
his
own
mind
to
the
vacant
throne
of
England
,
and
have
hope
of
marry
the
Princess
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
His
be
make
a
high
priest
,
however
,
put
an
end
to
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
,
the
venerable
Countess
of
Salisbury
---
who
be
,
unfortunately
for
herself
,
within
the
tyrant
's
reach
---
be
the
last
of
his
relative
on
whom
his
wrath
fall
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
be
tell
to
lay
her
grey
head
upon
the
block
,
she
answer
the
executioner
,
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
My
head
never
commit
treason
,
and
if
you
want
it
,
you
shall
seize
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
she
run
round
and
round
the
scaffold
with
the
executioner
strike
at
her
,
and
her
grey
hair
bedabble
with
blood
;
and
even
when
they
hold
her
down
upon
the
block
she
move
her
head
about
to
the
last
,
resolve
to
be
no
party
to
her
own
barbarous
murder
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
the
people
bear
,
as
they
have
bear
everything
else
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
they
bear
much
more
;
for
the
slow
fire
of
Smithfield
be
continually
burn
,
and
people
be
constantly
be
roast
to
death
---
still
to
show
what
a
good
Christian
the
King
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
defy
the
Pope
and
his
Bull
,
which
be
now
issue
,
and
have
come
into
England
;
but
he
burn
innumerable
people
whose
only
offence
be
that
they
differ
from
the
Pope
's
religious
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
wretched
man
name
LAMBERT
,
among
other
,
who
be
try
for
this
before
the
King
,
and
with
whom
six
bishop
argue
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
quite
exhausted
(
as
well
he
may
be
,
after
six
bishop
)
,
he
throw
himself
on
the
King
's
mercy
;
but
the
King
bluster
out
that
he
have
no
mercy
for
heretic
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
too
feed
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
the
people
bore
,
and
more
than
all
this
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
national
spirit
seem
to
have
be
banish
from
the
kingdom
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
the
very
people
who
be
execute
for
treason
,
the
very
wife
and
friend
of
the
"
bluff
"
King
,
speak
of
him
on
the
scaffold
as
a
good
prince
,
and
a
gentle
prince
---
just
as
serfs
in
similar
circumstance
have
be
know
to
do
,
under
the
Sultan
and
Bashaws
of
the
East
,
or
under
the
fierce
old
tyrant
of
Russia
,
who
pour
boil
and
freeze
water
on
them
alternately
,
until
they
die
.
<EOS>
the
Parliament
be
as
bad
as
the
rest
,
and
give
the
King
whatever
he
want
;
among
other
vile
accommodation
,
they
give
him
new
power
of
murdering
,
at
his
will
and
pleasure
,
any
one
whom
he
may
choose
to
call
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
bad
measure
they
pass
be
an
Act
of
six
article
,
commonly
call
at
the
time
"
the
whip
with
six
string
;
"
which
punish
offence
against
the
Pope
's
opinion
,
without
mercy
,
and
enforce
the
very
bad
part
of
the
monkish
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Cranmer
would
have
modify
it
,
if
he
could
;
but
,
be
overbear
by
the
Romish
party
,
have
not
the
power
.
 
<EOS>
as
one
of
the
article
declare
that
priest
should
not
marry
,
and
as
he
be
marry
himself
,
he
send
his
wife
and
child
into
Germany
,
and
begin
to
tremble
at
his
danger
;
none
the
less
because
he
be
,
and
have
long
be
,
the
King
's
friend
.
 
<EOS>
this
whip
of
six
string
be
make
under
the
King
's
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
never
be
forget
of
him
<EOS>
how
cruelly
he
support
the
bad
of
the
popish
doctrine
when
there
be
nothing
to
be
get
by
oppose
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
amiable
monarch
now
think
of
take
another
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
propose
to
the
french
King
to
have
some
of
the
lady
of
the
French
Court
exhibit
before
him
,
that
he
may
make
his
royal
choice
;
but
the
french
King
answer
that
he
would
rather
not
have
his
lady
trot
out
to
be
show
like
horse
at
a
fair
.
 
<EOS>
He
propose
to
the
Dowager
Duchess
of
Milan
,
who
reply
that
she
may
have
think
of
such
a
match
if
she
have
have
two
head
;
but
,
that
only
own
one
,
she
must
beg
to
keep
it
safe
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
Cromwell
represent
that
there
be
a
Protestant
Princess
in
Germany
---
those
who
hold
the
reform
religion
be
call
Protestants
,
because
their
leader
have
protest
against
the
abuse
and
imposition
of
the
unreformed
Church
---
name
anne
of
CLEVES
,
who
be
beautiful
,
and
would
answer
the
purpose
admirably
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
say
be
she
a
large
woman
,
because
he
must
have
a
fat
wife
?
"
<EOS>
o
yes
,
"
say
Cromwell
;
<EOS>
"
she
be
very
large
,
just
the
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
on
hear
this
the
King
send
over
his
famous
painter
,
Hans
Holbein
,
to
take
her
portrait
.
 
<EOS>
Hans
make
her
out
to
be
so
good
-
look
that
the
King
be
satisfied
,
and
the
marriage
be
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whether
anybody
have
pay
Hans
to
touch
up
the
picture
;
or
whether
Hans
,
like
one
or
two
other
painter
,
flatter
a
princess
in
the
ordinary
way
of
business
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
:
 
all
I
know
be
,
that
when
Anne
come
over
and
the
King
go
to
Rochester
to
meet
her
,
and
first
see
her
without
her
see
him
,
he
swear
she
be
"
a
great
Flanders
mare
,
"
and
say
he
would
never
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
be
oblige
to
do
it
now
<EOS>
matter
have
go
so
far
,
he
would
not
give
her
the
present
he
have
prepare
,
and
would
never
notice
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
forgive
Cromwell
his
part
in
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
His
downfall
date
from
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
quicken
by
his
enemy
,
in
the
interest
of
the
unreformed
religion
,
put
in
the
King
's
way
,
at
a
state
dinner
,
a
niece
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
CATHERINE
HOWARD
,
a
young
lady
of
fascinating
manner
,
though
small
in
stature
and
not
particularly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
fall
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
,
the
King
soon
divorce
Anne
of
clef
after
make
her
the
subject
of
much
brutal
talk
,
on
pretence
that
she
have
be
previously
betroth
to
some
one
else
---
which
would
never
do
for
one
of
his
dignity
---
and
marry
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
on
his
wedding
day
,
of
all
day
in
the
year
,
he
send
his
faithful
Cromwell
to
the
scaffold
,
and
have
his
head
strike
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
celebrate
the
occasion
by
burn
at
one
time
,
and
cause
to
be
draw
to
the
fire
on
the
same
hurdle
,
some
protestant
prisoner
for
deny
the
Pope
's
doctrine
,
and
some
roman
catholic
prisoner
for
deny
his
own
supremacy
.
 
<EOS>
still
the
people
bear
it
,
and
not
a
gentleman
in
England
raise
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
by
a
just
retribution
,
it
soon
come
out
that
Catherine
Howard
,
before
her
marriage
,
have
be
really
guilty
of
such
crime
as
the
King
have
falsely
attribute
to
his
second
wife
Anne
Boleyn
;
so
,
again
the
dreadful
axe
make
the
King
a
widower
,
and
this
Queen
pass
away
as
so
many
in
that
reign
have
pass
away
before
her
.
<EOS>
as
an
appropriate
pursuit
under
the
circumstance
,
Henry
then
apply
himself
to
superintend
the
composition
of
a
religious
book
call
"
a
necessary
doctrine
for
any
christian
Man
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
a
little
confused
in
his
mind
,
I
think
,
at
about
this
period
;
for
he
be
so
false
to
himself
as
to
be
true
to
some
one
:
that
some
one
be
Cranmer
,
whom
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
and
other
of
his
enemy
try
to
ruin
;
but
to
whom
the
king
be
steadfast
,
and
to
whom
he
one
night
give
his
ring
,
charge
him
when
he
should
find
himself
,
next
day
,
accuse
of
treason
,
to
show
it
to
the
council
board
.
 
<EOS>
this
Cranmer
do
to
the
confusion
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
King
think
he
may
want
him
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
marry
yet
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
strange
to
say
,
he
find
in
England
another
woman
who
would
become
his
wife
,
and
she
be
CATHERINE
PARR
,
widow
of
Lord
Latimer
.
 
<EOS>
She
lean
towards
the
reform
religion
;
and
it
be
some
comfort
to
know
,
that
she
torment
the
King
considerably
by
argue
a
variety
of
doctrinal
point
with
him
on
all
possible
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
very
nearly
do
this
to
her
own
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
after
one
of
these
conversation
the
King
in
a
very
black
mood
actually
instruct
GARDINER
,
one
of
his
Bishops
who
favour
the
popish
opinion
,
to
draw
a
bill
of
accusation
against
her
,
which
would
have
inevitably
bring
her
to
the
scaffold
where
her
predecessor
have
die
,
but
that
one
of
her
friend
pick
up
the
paper
of
instruction
which
have
be
drop
in
the
palace
,
and
give
her
timely
notice
.
 
<EOS>
She
fall
ill
with
terror
;
but
manage
the
king
so
well
when
he
come
to
entrap
her
into
further
statement
---
by
say
that
she
have
only
speak
on
such
point
to
divert
his
mind
and
to
get
some
information
from
his
extraordinary
wisdom
---
that
he
give
her
a
kiss
and
call
her
his
sweetheart
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
when
the
Chancellor
come
next
day
actually
to
take
her
to
the
Tower
,
the
King
send
him
about
his
business
,
and
honour
him
with
the
epithet
of
a
beast
,
a
knave
,
and
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
so
near
be
Catherine
Parr
to
the
block
,
and
so
narrow
be
her
escape
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
war
with
Scotland
in
this
reign
,
and
a
short
clumsy
war
with
France
for
favour
Scotland
;
but
,
the
event
at
home
be
so
dreadful
,
and
leave
such
an
endure
stain
on
the
country
,
<EOS>
that
I
need
say
no
more
of
what
happen
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
more
horror
,
and
this
reign
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
lady
,
ANNE
ASKEW
,
in
Lincolnshire
,
who
incline
to
the
protestant
opinion
,
and
whose
husband
be
a
fierce
Catholic
,
turn
her
out
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
London
,
and
be
consider
as
offend
against
the
six
article
,
and
be
take
to
the
Tower
,
and
put
upon
the
rack
---
probably
because
it
be
hope
that
she
may
,
in
her
agony
,
criminate
some
obnoxious
person
;
if
falsely
,
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
She
be
torture
without
utter
a
cry
,
until
the
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
would
suffer
his
man
to
torture
her
no
more
;
and
then
two
priest
who
be
present
actually
pull
off
their
robe
,
and
turn
the
wheel
of
the
rack
with
their
own
hand
,
so
rend
and
twist
and
break
her
that
she
be
afterwards
carry
to
the
fire
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
burn
with
three
other
,
a
gentleman
,
a
clergyman
,
and
a
tailor
;
and
so
the
world
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
either
the
King
become
afraid
of
the
power
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
and
his
son
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
or
they
give
him
some
offence
,
but
he
resolve
to
pull
them
down
,
to
follow
all
the
rest
who
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
son
be
try
first
---
of
course
for
nothing
---
and
defend
himself
bravely
;
but
of
course
he
be
find
guilty
,
and
of
course
he
be
execute
.
 
<EOS>
then
his
father
be
lay
hold
of
,
and
leave
for
death
too
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
King
himself
be
leave
for
death
by
a
Greater
King
,
and
the
earth
be
to
be
rid
of
him
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
a
swollen
,
hideous
spectacle
,
with
a
great
hole
in
his
leg
,
and
so
odious
to
every
sense
that
it
be
dreadful
to
approach
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
find
to
be
die
,
Cranmer
be
send
for
from
his
palace
at
Croydon
,
and
come
with
all
speed
,
but
find
him
speechless
.
 
<EOS>
happily
,
in
that
hour
he
perish
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
fifty
-
sixth
year
of
his
age
,
and
the
thirty
-
eighth
of
his
reign
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
the
Eighth
have
be
favour
by
some
protestant
writer
,
because
the
Reformation
be
achieve
in
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
mighty
merit
of
it
lie
with
other
man
and
not
with
him
;
and
it
can
be
render
none
the
bad
by
this
monster
's
crime
,
and
none
the
well
by
any
defence
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
plain
truth
be
,
that
he
be
a
most
intolerable
ruffian
,
a
disgrace
to
human
nature
,
and
a
blot
of
blood
and
grease
upon
the
History
of
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
Sixth
    
HENRY
the
EIGHTH
have
make
a
will
,
appoint
a
council
of
sixteen
to
govern
the
kingdom
for
his
son
while
he
be
under
age
<EOS>
(
he
be
now
only
ten
year
old
)
,
and
another
council
of
twelve
to
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
powerful
of
the
first
council
be
the
EARL
of
HERTFORD
,
the
young
King
's
uncle
,
who
lose
no
time
in
bring
his
nephew
with
great
state
up
to
Enfield
,
and
thence
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
consider
at
the
time
a
strike
proof
of
virtue
in
the
young
King
that
he
be
sorry
for
his
father
's
death
;
but
,
as
common
subject
have
that
virtue
too
,
<EOS>
sometimes
,
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
curious
part
of
the
late
King
's
will
,
require
his
executor
to
fulfil
whatever
promise
he
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
court
wonder
what
these
may
be
,
the
Earl
of
Hertford
and
the
other
nobleman
interested
,
say
that
they
be
promise
to
advance
and
enrich
them
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
Earl
of
Hertford
make
himself
duke
of
SOMERSET
,
and
make
his
brother
EDWARD
seymour
a
baron
;
and
there
be
various
similar
promotion
,
all
very
agreeable
to
the
party
concern
,
and
very
dutiful
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
late
King
's
memory
.
<EOS>
to
be
more
dutiful
still
,
they
make
themselves
rich
out
of
the
Church
land
,
and
be
very
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
the
new
Duke
of
Somerset
cause
himself
to
be
declare
PROTECTOR
of
the
kingdom
,
and
be
,
indeed
,
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
as
young
Edward
the
Sixth
have
be
bring
up
in
the
principle
of
the
protestant
religion
,
everybody
know
that
they
would
be
maintain
.
 
<EOS>
but
Cranmer
,
to
whom
they
be
chiefly
entrust
,
advance
them
steadily
and
temperately
.
 
<EOS>
many
superstitious
and
ridiculous
practice
be
stop
;
but
practice
which
be
harmless
be
not
interfere
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
the
Protector
,
be
anxious
to
have
the
young
King
engage
in
marriage
to
the
young
Queen
of
Scotland
,
in
order
to
prevent
that
princess
from
make
an
alliance
with
any
foreign
power
;
but
,
as
a
large
party
in
Scotland
be
unfavourable
to
this
plan
,
he
invade
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
His
excuse
for
do
so
be
,
that
the
border
man
---
that
is
,
the
Scotch
who
live
in
that
part
of
the
country
where
England
and
Scotland
join
---
trouble
the
English
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
two
side
to
this
question
;
for
the
English
Border
man
trouble
the
Scotch
too
;
and
,
through
many
long
year
,
there
be
perpetual
border
quarrel
which
give
rise
to
number
of
old
tale
and
song
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
Protector
invade
Scotland
;
and
ARRAN
,
the
Scottish
Regent
,
with
an
army
twice
as
large
as
his
,
advance
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
encounter
on
the
bank
of
the
river
Esk
,
within
a
few
mile
of
Edinburgh
;
and
there
,
after
a
little
skirmish
,
the
Protector
make
such
moderate
proposal
,
in
offer
to
retire
if
the
Scotch
would
only
engage
not
to
marry
their
princess
to
any
foreign
prince
,
that
the
Regent
think
the
English
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
he
make
a
horrible
mistake
;
for
the
english
soldier
on
land
,
and
the
english
sailor
on
the
water
,
so
set
upon
the
Scotch
,
that
they
break
and
flee
,
and
more
than
ten
thousand
of
them
be
kill
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
battle
,
for
the
fugitive
be
slay
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
for
four
mile
,
all
the
way
to
Edinburgh
,
be
strew
with
dead
man
,
and
with
arm
,
and
leg
,
and
head
.
 
<EOS>
some
hide
themselves
in
stream
and
be
drown
;
some
throw
away
their
armour
and
be
kill
run
,
almost
naked
;
but
in
this
battle
of
Pinkey
the
English
lose
only
two
or
three
hundred
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
much
better
clothe
than
the
Scotch
;
at
the
poverty
of
whose
appearance
and
country
they
be
exceedingly
astonish
.
  
<EOS>
a
Parliament
be
call
when
Somerset
come
back
,
and
it
repeal
the
whip
with
six
string
,
and
do
one
or
two
other
good
thing
;
though
it
unhappily
retain
the
punishment
of
burn
for
those
people
who
do
not
make
believe
to
believe
,
in
all
religious
matter
,
what
the
Government
have
declare
that
they
must
and
should
believe
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
make
a
foolish
law
(
mean
to
put
down
beggar
)
,
that
any
man
who
live
idly
and
loiter
about
for
three
day
together
,
should
be
burn
with
a
hot
iron
,
make
a
slave
,
and
wear
an
iron
fetter
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
savage
absurdity
soon
come
to
an
end
,
and
go
the
way
of
a
great
many
other
foolish
law
.
  
<EOS>
the
Protector
be
now
so
proud
that
he
sit
in
Parliament
before
all
the
noble
,
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
many
other
nobleman
,
who
only
want
to
be
as
proud
if
they
could
get
a
chance
,
become
his
enemy
of
course
;
and
it
be
suppose
that
he
come
back
suddenly
from
Scotland
because
he
have
receive
news
that
his
brother
,
LORD
SEYMOUR
,
be
become
dangerous
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
lord
be
now
High
Admiral
of
England
;
a
very
handsome
man
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
the
Court
lady
---
even
with
the
young
Princess
Elizabeth
,
who
romp
with
him
a
little
more
than
young
princess
in
these
time
do
with
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
marry
Catherine
Parr
,
the
late
King
's
widow
,
who
be
now
dead
;
and
,
to
strengthen
his
power
,
he
secretly
supply
the
young
King
with
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
even
have
engage
with
some
of
his
brother
's
enemy
in
a
plot
to
carry
the
boy
off
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
and
other
accusation
,
at
any
rate
,
he
be
confine
in
the
Tower
,
impeach
,
and
find
guilty
;
his
own
brother
's
name
being
---
unnatural
and
sad
to
tell
---
the
first
sign
to
the
warrant
of
his
execution
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
execute
on
Tower
Hill
,
and
die
deny
his
treason
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
his
last
proceeding
in
this
world
be
to
write
two
letter
,
one
to
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
and
one
to
the
Princess
Mary
,
which
a
servant
of
his
took
charge
of
,
and
conceal
in
his
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
these
letter
be
suppose
to
have
urge
them
against
his
brother
,
and
to
revenge
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
what
they
truly
contain
be
not
know
;
but
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
have
,
at
one
time
,
obtain
great
influence
over
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
,
the
protestant
religion
be
make
progress
.
 
<EOS>
the
image
which
the
people
have
gradually
come
to
worship
,
be
remove
from
the
church
;
the
people
be
inform
that
they
need
not
confess
themselves
to
priest
unless
they
choose
;
a
common
prayer
-
book
be
draw
up
in
the
english
language
,
which
all
could
understand
,
and
many
other
improvement
be
make
;
still
moderately
.
 
<EOS>
for
Cranmer
be
a
very
moderate
man
,
and
even
restrain
the
protestant
clergy
from
violently
abuse
the
unreformed
religion
---
as
they
very
often
do
,
and
which
be
not
a
good
example
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
people
be
at
this
time
in
great
distress
.
<EOS>
the
rapacious
nobility
who
have
come
into
possession
of
the
Church
land
,
be
very
bad
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
They
enclose
great
quantity
of
ground
for
the
feeding
of
sheep
,
which
be
then
more
profitable
than
the
growing
of
crop
;
and
this
increase
the
general
distress
.
<EOS>
so
the
people
,
who
still
understand
little
of
what
be
go
on
about
them
,
and
still
readily
believe
what
the
homeless
monk
tell
them
---
many
of
whom
have
be
their
good
friend
in
their
well
day
---
take
it
into
their
head
that
all
this
be
owe
to
the
reform
religion
,
and
therefore
rise
,
in
many
part
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
most
powerful
rising
be
in
Devonshire
and
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
in
Devonshire
,
the
rebellion
be
so
strong
that
ten
thousand
man
unite
within
a
few
day
,
and
even
lay
siege
to
Exeter
.
 
<EOS>
but
LORD
RUSSELL
,
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
citizen
who
defend
that
town
,
defeat
the
rebel
;
and
,
not
only
hang
the
Mayor
of
one
place
,
but
hang
the
vicar
of
another
from
his
own
church
steeple
.
<EOS>
what
with
hang
and
kill
by
the
sword
,
four
thousand
of
the
rebel
be
suppose
to
have
fall
in
that
one
county
.
 
<EOS>
in
Norfolk
(
where
the
rise
be
more
against
the
enclosure
of
open
land
than
against
the
reformed
religion
)
,
the
popular
leader
be
a
man
name
ROBERT
KET
,
a
tanner
of
Wymondham
.
 
<EOS>
the
mob
be
,
in
the
first
instance
,
excite
against
the
tanner
by
one
JOHN
FLOWERDEW
,
a
gentleman
who
owe
him
a
grudge
:
 
but
the
tanner
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
gentleman
,
since
he
soon
get
the
people
on
his
side
,
and
establish
himself
near
Norwich
with
quite
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
oak
-
tree
in
that
place
,
on
a
spot
call
Moushold
Hill
,
which
Ket
name
the
Tree
of
Reformation
;
and
under
its
green
bough
,
he
and
his
man
sit
,
in
the
midsummer
weather
,
hold
court
of
justice
,
and
debate
affair
of
state
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
even
impartial
enough
to
allow
some
rather
tiresome
public
speaker
to
get
up
into
this
Tree
of
Reformation
,
and
point
out
their
error
to
them
,
in
long
discourse
,
while
they
lay
listen
(
not
always
without
some
grumble
and
growl
)
in
the
shade
below
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
sunny
July
day
,
a
herald
appear
below
the
tree
,
and
proclaim
Ket
and
all
his
man
traitor
,
unless
from
that
moment
they
disperse
and
go
home
:
 
in
which
case
they
be
to
receive
a
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Ket
and
his
man
make
light
of
the
herald
and
become
strong
than
ever
,
until
the
Earl
of
Warwick
go
after
them
with
a
sufficient
force
,
and
cut
them
all
to
piece
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
be
hang
,
draw
,
and
quarter
,
as
traitor
,
and
their
limb
be
send
into
various
country
place
to
be
a
terror
to
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
nine
of
them
be
hang
upon
nine
green
branch
of
the
Oak
of
Reformation
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
for
the
time
,
that
tree
may
be
say
to
have
wither
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
Protector
,
though
a
haughty
man
,
have
compassion
for
the
real
distress
of
the
common
people
,
and
a
sincere
desire
to
help
them
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
proud
and
too
high
in
degree
to
hold
even
their
favour
steadily
;
and
many
of
the
noble
always
envy
and
hate
him
,
because
they
be
as
proud
and
not
as
high
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
at
this
time
build
a
great
Palace
in
the
Strand
:
 
to
get
the
stone
for
which
he
blow
up
church
steeple
with
gunpowder
,
and
pull
down
bishop
"
house
:
 
thus
make
himself
still
more
disliked
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
his
principal
enemy
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
---
Dudley
by
name
,
and
the
son
of
that
Dudley
who
have
make
himself
so
odious
with
Empson
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
the
Seventh
---
join
with
seven
other
member
of
the
Council
against
him
,
form
a
separate
Council
;
and
,
become
strong
in
a
few
day
,
send
him
to
the
Tower
under
twenty
-
nine
article
of
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
after
be
sentence
by
the
Council
to
the
forfeiture
of
all
his
office
and
land
,
he
be
liberate
and
pardon
,
on
make
a
very
humble
submission
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
even
take
back
into
the
Council
again
,
after
have
suffer
this
fall
,
and
marry
his
daughter
,
LADY
ANNE
seymour
,
to
Warwick
's
eld
son
.
 
<EOS>
but
such
a
reconciliation
be
little
likely
to
last
,
and
do
not
outlive
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Warwick
,
have
get
himself
make
Duke
of
Northumberland
,
and
have
advance
the
more
important
of
his
friend
,
then
finish
the
history
by
cause
the
Duke
of
Somerset
and
his
friend
LORD
GREY
,
and
other
,
to
be
arrest
for
treason
,
in
have
conspire
to
seize
and
dethrone
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
also
accuse
of
have
intend
to
seize
the
new
Duke
of
Northumberland
,
with
his
friend
LORD
NORTHAMPTON
and
LORD
PEMBROKE
;
to
murder
them
if
they
find
need
;
and
to
raise
the
city
to
revolt
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
the
fallen
Protector
positively
deny
;
except
that
he
confess
to
have
speak
of
the
murder
of
those
three
nobleman
,
but
have
never
design
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
acquit
of
the
charge
of
treason
,
and
find
guilty
of
the
other
charge
;
so
when
the
people
---
who
remember
his
have
be
their
friend
,
now
that
he
be
disgrace
and
in
danger
,
see
him
come
out
from
his
trial
with
the
axe
turn
from
him
---
they
think
he
be
altogether
acquit
,
and
send
up
a
loud
shout
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
order
to
be
behead
on
Tower
Hill
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
proclamation
be
issue
bid
the
citizen
keep
at
home
until
after
ten
.
 
<EOS>
They
fill
the
street
,
however
,
and
crowd
the
place
of
execution
as
soon
as
it
be
light
;
and
,
with
sad
face
and
sad
heart
,
see
the
once
powerful
Protector
ascend
the
scaffold
to
lay
his
head
upon
the
dreadful
block
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
yet
say
his
last
word
to
them
with
manly
courage
,
and
tell
them
,
in
particular
,
how
it
comfort
him
,
at
that
pass
,
to
have
assist
in
reform
the
national
religion
,
a
member
of
the
Council
be
see
ride
up
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
They
again
think
that
the
Duke
be
save
by
his
bring
a
reprieve
,
and
again
shout
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
himself
tell
them
they
be
mistaken
,
and
lay
down
his
head
and
have
it
strike
off
at
a
blow
.
  
<EOS>
many
of
the
bystander
rush
forward
and
steep
their
handkerchief
in
his
blood
,
as
a
mark
of
their
affection
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
be
capable
of
many
good
act
,
and
one
of
them
be
discover
after
he
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Durham
,
a
very
good
man
,
have
be
inform
against
to
the
Council
,
when
the
Duke
be
in
power
,
as
have
answer
a
treacherous
letter
propose
a
rebellion
against
the
reform
religion
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
answer
could
not
be
find
,
he
could
not
be
declare
guilty
;
but
it
be
now
discover
,
hide
by
the
Duke
himself
among
some
private
paper
,
in
his
regard
for
that
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
lose
his
office
,
and
be
deprive
of
his
possession
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
pleasant
to
know
that
while
his
uncle
lie
in
prison
under
sentence
of
death
,
the
young
King
be
be
vastly
entertain
by
play
,
and
dance
,
and
sham
fight
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
doubt
of
it
,
for
he
keep
a
journal
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasanter
to
know
that
not
a
single
Roman
Catholic
be
burn
in
this
reign
for
hold
that
religion
;
though
two
wretched
victim
suffer
for
heresy
.
 
<EOS>
one
,
a
woman
name
JOAN
BOCHER
,
for
profess
some
opinion
that
even
she
could
only
explain
in
unintelligible
jargon
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
a
Dutchman
,
name
VON
PARIS
,
who
practise
as
a
surgeon
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
be
,
to
his
credit
,
exceedingly
unwilling
to
sign
the
warrant
for
the
woman
's
execution
:
 
shed
tear
before
he
do
so
,
and
tell
Cranmer
,
who
urge
him
to
do
it
(
though
Cranmer
really
would
have
spare
the
woman
at
first
,
but
for
her
own
determined
obstinacy
)
,
that
the
guilt
be
not
his
,
but
that
of
the
man
who
so
strongly
urge
the
dreadful
act
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
too
soon
,
whether
the
time
ever
come
when
Cranmer
be
likely
to
have
remember
this
with
sorrow
and
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
Cranmer
and
RIDLEY
(
at
first
Bishop
of
Rochester
,
and
afterwards
Bishop
of
London
)
be
the
most
powerful
of
the
clergy
of
this
reign
.
 
<EOS>
other
be
imprison
and
deprive
of
their
property
for
still
adhere
to
the
unreformed
religion
;
the
most
important
among
whom
be
GARDINER
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
HEATH
Bishop
of
Worcester
,
DAY
Bishop
of
Chichester
,
and
BONNER
that
Bishop
of
London
who
be
supersede
by
Ridley
.
 
<EOS>
the
Princess
Mary
,
who
inherit
her
mother
's
gloomy
temper
,
and
hate
the
reform
religion
as
connect
with
her
mother
's
wrong
and
sorrow
<EOS>
---
she
know
nothing
else
about
it
,
always
refuse
to
read
a
single
book
in
which
it
be
truly
describe
---
hold
by
the
unreformed
religion
too
,
and
be
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
for
whom
the
old
Mass
be
allow
to
be
perform
;
nor
would
the
young
King
have
make
that
exception
even
in
her
favour
,
but
for
the
strong
persuasion
of
Cranmer
and
Ridley
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
view
it
with
horror
;
and
when
he
fall
into
a
sickly
condition
,
after
have
be
very
ill
,
first
of
the
measle
and
then
of
the
small
-
pox
,
he
be
greatly
trouble
in
mind
to
think
that
if
he
die
,
and
she
,
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
,
succeed
,
the
roman
catholic
religion
would
be
set
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
uneasiness
,
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
be
not
slow
to
encourage
:
 
for
,
if
the
Princess
Mary
come
to
the
throne
,
he
,
who
have
take
part
with
the
Protestants
,
be
sure
to
be
disgrace
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
Duchess
of
Suffolk
be
descend
from
King
Henry
the
Seventh
;
and
,
if
she
resign
what
little
or
no
right
<EOS>
she
have
,
in
favour
of
her
daughter
LADY
JANE
GREY
,
that
would
be
the
succession
to
promote
the
Duke
's
greatness
;
because
LORD
GUILFORD
DUDLEY
,
one
of
his
son
,
be
,
at
this
very
time
,
newly
married
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
work
upon
the
King
's
fear
,
and
persuade
him
to
set
aside
both
the
Princess
Mary
and
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
and
assert
his
right
to
appoint
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
the
young
King
hand
to
the
Crown
lawyer
a
writing
sign
half
a
dozen
time
over
by
himself
,
appoint
Lady
Jane
Grey
to
succeed
to
the
Crown
,
and
require
them
to
have
his
will
make
out
accord
to
law
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
much
against
it
at
first
,
and
tell
the
King
so
;
but
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
---
be
so
violent
about
it
that
the
lawyer
even
expect
him
to
beat
them
,
and
hotly
declare
that
,
strip
to
his
shirt
,
he
would
fight
any
man
in
such
a
quarrel
---
they
yield
.
<EOS>
Cranmer
,
also
,
at
first
hesitate
;
plead
that
he
have
swear
to
maintain
the
succession
of
the
Crown
to
the
Princess
Mary
;
but
,
he
be
a
weak
man
in
his
resolution
,
and
afterwards
sign
the
document
with
the
rest
of
the
council
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
complete
none
too
soon
;
for
Edward
be
now
sink
in
a
rapid
decline
;
and
,
by
way
of
make
him
better
,
they
hand
him
over
to
a
woman
-
doctor
who
pretend
to
be
able
to
cure
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
speedily
get
bad
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
sixth
of
July
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
fifty
-
three
,
he
die
,
very
peaceably
and
piously
,
pray
God
,
with
his
last
breath
,
to
protect
the
reform
religion
.
  
<EOS>
this
King
die
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
his
age
,
and
in
the
seventh
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
judge
what
the
character
of
one
so
young
may
afterwards
have
become
among
so
many
bad
,
ambitious
,
quarrel
noble
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
be
an
amiable
boy
,
of
very
good
ability
,
and
have
nothing
coarse
or
cruel
or
brutal
in
his
disposition
---
which
in
the
son
of
such
a
father
be
rather
surprising
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Mary
    
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
be
very
anxious
to
keep
the
young
King
's
death
a
secret
,
in
order
that
he
may
get
the
two
princess
into
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
Princess
Mary
,
be
inform
of
that
event
as
she
be
on
her
way
to
London
to
see
her

the
Earl

her
friend

and
it
be
he
who
send
her
warning
of
what
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
secret
could
not
be
keep
,
the
Duke

Northumberland
and
the
council
send
for
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
and
some
of
the
alderman
,
and
make
a
merit
of
tell
it
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
they
make
it
known
to
the
people
,
and
set
off
to
inform
Lady
Jane
Grey
that
she
be
to
be
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
pretty
girl
of
only
sixteen
,
and
be
amiable
,
learn
,
and
clever
.
 
<EOS>
when
the

who
come

fall
on
their
knee
before

and
tell

<EOS>
on

sorrow
for
the
young
King

death
,
and
say
that
she
know
she
be
unfit
to
govern
the
kingdom
;
but
that
if
she
must
be
Queen
,
she
pray
God
to
direct
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
then
at
Sion
House
,
near
Brentford
;
and
the
lord
take
her
down
the
river
in
state
to
the
Tower
,
that
she
may
remain
there
(
as
the
custom
be
)
until
she
be
crown
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
people
be
not
at
all
favourable
to
Lady
Jane
,
consider
that
the
right
to
be
Queen
be
Mary
's
,
and
greatly
dislike
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
put
into
a
well
humour
by
the
Duke
's
cause
a
vintner
's
servant
,
one
Gabriel
Pot
,
to
be
take
up
for
express
his
dissatisfaction
among
the
crowd
,
and
to
have
his
ear
nail
to
the
pillory
,
and
cut
off
.
 
<EOS>
some
powerful
man
among
the
nobility
declare
on
Mary
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
raise
troop
to
support
her
cause
,
have
her
proclaim
Queen
at
Norwich
,
and
gather
around
her
at
the
castle
of
Framlingham
,
which
belong
to
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
she
be
not
consider
so
safe
as
yet
,
but
that
it
be
good
to
keep
her
in
a
castle
on
the
sea
-
coast
,
from
whence
she
may
be
send
abroad
,
if
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
the
Council
would
have
despatch
Lady
Jane
's
father
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
as
the
general
of
the
army
against
this
force
;
but
,
as
Lady
Jane
implore
that
her
father
may
remain
with
her
,
and
as
he
be
know
to
be
but
a
weak
man
,
they
tell
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
that
he
must
take
the
command
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
very
ready
to
do
so
,
as
he
mistrust
the
Council
much
;
but
there
be
no
help
for
it
,
and
he
set
forth
with
a
heavy
heart
,
observe
to
a
lord
who
ride
beside
him
through
Shoreditch
at
the
head
of
the
troop
,
that
,
although
the
people
press
in
great
number
to
look
at
them
,
they
be
terribly
silent
.
  
<EOS>
and
his
fear
for
himself
turn
out
to
be
well
found
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
wait
at
Cambridge
for
further
help
from
the
Council
,
the
Council
take
it
into
their
head
to
turn
their
back
on
Lady
Jane
's
cause
,
and
to
take
up
the
Princess
Mary
's
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
chiefly
owe
to
the
before
-
mention
Earl
of
Arundel
,
who
represent
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
,
in
a
second
interview
with
those
sagacious
person
,
that
,
as
for
himself
,
he
do
not
perceive
the
reformed
religion
to
be
in
much
danger
---
which
Lord
Pembroke
back
by
flourish
his
sword
as
another
kind
of
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
,
thus
enlighten
,
say
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
Princess
Mary
ought
to
be
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
she
be
proclaim
at
the
Cross
by
St
Paul
's
,
and
barrel
of
wine
be
give
to
the
people
,
and
they
get
very
drunk
,
and
dance
round
blazing
bonfire
---
little
thinking
,
<EOS>
poor
wretch
,
what
other
bonfire
would
soon
be
blaze
in
Queen
Mary
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
ten
day
"
dream
of
royalty
,
Lady
Jane
Grey
resign
the
Crown
with
great
willingness
,
say
that
she
have
only
accept
it
in
obedience
to
her
father
and
mother
;
and
go
gladly
back
to
her
pleasant
house
by
the
river
,
and
her
book
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
then
come
on
towards
London
;
and
at
Wanstead
in
Essex
,
be
join
by
her
half
-
sister
,
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
They
pass
through
the
street
of
London
to
the
Tower
,
and
there
the
new
Queen
meet
some
eminent
prisoner
then
confine
in
it
,
kiss
them
,
and
give
them
their
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
among
these
be
that
Gardiner
,
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
who
have
be
imprison
in
the
last
reign
for
hold
to
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Him
<EOS>
she
soon
make
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
have
be
take
prisoner
,
and
,
together
with
his
son
and
five
other
,
be
quickly
bring
before
the
Council
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
not
unnaturally
,
ask
that
Council
,
in
his
defence
,
whether
it
be
treason
to
obey
order
that
have
be
issue
under
the
great
seal
;
and
,
if
it
be
,
whether
they
,
who
have
obey
them
too
,
ought
to
be
his
judge
?
 
<EOS>
but
they
make
light
of
these
point
;
and
,
be
resolve
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
,
soon
sentence
him
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
rise
into
power
upon
the
death
of
another
man
,
and
make
but
a
poor
show
(
as
may
be
expect
)
when
he
himself
lie
low
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreat
Gardiner
to
let
him
live
,
if
it
be
only
in
a
mouse
's
hole
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
ascend
the
scaffold
to
be
behead
on
Tower
Hill
,
address
the
people
in
a
miserable
way
,
say
that
he
have
be
incite
by
other
,
and
exhort
them
to
return
to
the
unreformed
religion
,
which
he
tell
them
be
his
faith
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
reason
to
suppose
that
he
expect
a
pardon
even
then
,
in
return
for
this
confession
;
but
it
matter
little
whether
he
do
or
not
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
strike
off
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
now
crown
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
thirty
-
seven
year
of
age
,
short
and
thin
,
wrinkle
in
the
face
,
and
very
unhealthy
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
a
great
liking
for
show
and
for
bright
colour
,
and
all
the
lady
of
her
Court
be
magnificently
dress
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
liking
too
for
old
custom
,
without
much
sense
in
them
;
and
she
be
oil
in
the
old
way
,
and
bless
in
the
old
way
,
and
do
all
manner
of
thing
to
in
the
old
way
,
at
her
coronation
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
do
her
good
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
begin
to
show
her
desire
to
put
down
the
Reformed
religion
,
and
put
up
the
unreformed
one
:
 
though
it
be
dangerous
work
as
yet
,
the
people
be
something
wise
than
they
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
even
cast
a
shower
of
stone
---
and
among
them
a
dagger
---
at
one
of
the
royal
chaplain
who
attack
the
Reformed
religion
in
a
public
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Queen
and
her
priest
go
steadily
on
.
<EOS>
Ridley
,
the
powerful
bishop
of
the
last
reign
,
be
seize
and
send
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
LATIMER
,
also
celebrate
among
the
Clergy
of
the
last
reign
,
be
likewise
send
to
the
Tower
,
and
Cranmer
speedily
follow
.
 
<EOS>
Latimer
be
an
aged
man
;
and
,
as
his
guard
take
him
through
Smithfield
,
he
look
round
it
,
and
say
,
"
this
be
a
place
that
hath
long
groan
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
he
know
well
,
what
kind
of
bonfire
would
soon
be
burn
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
knowledge
confine
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
prison
be
fast
fill
with
the
chief
Protestants
,
who
be
there
leave
rot
in
darkness
,
hunger
,
dirt
,
and
separation
from
their
friend
;
many
,
who
have
time
leave
them
for
escape
,
flee
from
the
kingdom
;
and
the
dull
of
the
people
begin
,
now
,
to
see
what
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
on
fast
.
 
<EOS>
a
Parliament
be
get
together
;
not
without
strong
suspicion
of
unfairness
;
and
they
annul
the
divorce
,
formerly
pronounce
by
Cranmer
between
the
Queen
's
mother
and
King
Henry
the
Eighth
,
and
unmade
all
the
law
on
the
subject
of
religion
that
have
be
make
in
the
last
King
Edward
's
reign
.
 
<EOS>
They
begin
their
proceeding
,
in
violation
of
the
law
,
by
have
the
old
mass
say
before
them
in
Latin
,
and
by
turn
out
a
bishop
who
would
not
kneel
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
also
declare
guilty
of
treason
,
Lady
Jane
Grey
for
aspire
to
the
Crown
;
her
husband
,
for
be
her
husband
;
and
Cranmer
,
for
not
believe
in
the
mass
aforesaid
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
pray
the
Queen
graciously
to
choose
a
husband
for
herself
,
as
soon
as
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
question
who
should
be
the
Queen
's
husband
have
give
rise
to
a
great
deal
of
discussion
,
and
to
several
contend
party
.
<EOS>
some
say
Cardinal
Pole
be
the
man
---
but
the
Queen
be
of
opinion
that
he
be
not
the
man
,
he
be
too
old
and
too
much
of
a
student
.
 
<EOS>
other
say
that
the
gallant
young
COURTENAY
,
whom
the
Queen
have
make
Earl
of
Devonshire
,
be
the
man
---
and
the
Queen
think
so
too
,
for
a
while
;
but
she
change
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
it
appear
that
PHILIP
,
PRINCE
of
SPAIN
,
be
certainly
the
man
---
though
certainly
not
the
people
's
man
;
for
they
detest
the
idea
of
such
a
marriage
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
and
murmur
that
the
Spaniard
would
establish
in
England
,
by
the
aid
of
foreign
soldier
,
the
bad
abuse
of
the
popish
religion
,
and
even
the
terrible
inquisition
itself
.
  
<EOS>
these
discontent
give
rise
to
a
conspiracy
for
marry
young
Courtenay
to
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
and
set
them
up
,
with
popular
tumult
all
over
the
kingdom
,
against
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
discover
in
time
by
Gardiner
;
but
in
Kent
,
the
old
bold
county
,
the
people
rise
in
their
old
bold
way
.
 
<EOS>
SIR
THOMAS
WYAT
,
a
man
of
great
daring
,
be
their
leader
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
his
standard
at
Maidstone
,
march
on
to
Rochester
,
establish
himself
in
the
old
castle
there
,
and
prepare
to
hold
out
against
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
who
come
against
him
with
a
party
of
the
Queen

and
a
body
of
five
hundred
London

<EOS>
the
London
man
,
however
,
be
all
for
Elizabeth

and
not

<EOS>
They
declare

Wyat
;
the
Duke

;
and
Wyat
come
on
to
Deptford
,
at
the
head
of
fifteen
thousand
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
,
in
their
turn
,
fall
away
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
Southwark
,
there
be
only
two
thousand
leave
.
 
<EOS>
not
dismay
by
find
the
London
citizen
in
arm
,
and
the
gun
at
the
Tower
ready
to
oppose
his
cross

river
there
,
Wyat
lead
them
off
to
Kingston
-
upon
-
Thames
,
intend
to
cross
the
bridge
that
he
know
to
be
in
that
place
,
and
so
to
work
his
way
round
to
Ludgate
,
one
of
the
old
gate
of
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
the
bridge
break
down
,
but
mend
it
,
come
across
,
and
bravely
fight
his
way
up
Fleet
Street
to
Ludgate
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
find
the
gate
close
against
him
,
he
fight
his
way
back
again
,
sword
in

,
to
Temple
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
be
overpower
,
he
surrender
himself
,
and
three
or
four
hundred
of
his
man
be
take
,
besides
a
hundred
kill
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
,
in
a
moment
of
weakness
(
and
perhaps
of
torture
)
be
afterwards
make
to
accuse
the
Princess
Elizabeth
as
his
accomplice
to
some
very
small
extent
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
manhood
soon
return
to
him
,
and
he
refuse
to
save
his
life
by
make
any
more
false
confession
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quarter
and
distribute
in
the
usual
brutal
way
,
and
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
of
his
follower
be
hang
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
be
lead
out
,
with
halter
round
their
neck
,
to
be
pardon
,
and
to
make
a
parade
of
cry
out
,
"
God
save
Queen
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
danger
of
this
rebellion
,
the
Queen
show
herself
to
be
a
woman
of
courage
and
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
She
disdain
to
retreat
to
any
place
of
safety
,
and
go
down
to
the
Guildhall
,
sceptre
in
hand
,
and
make
a
gallant
speech
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
citizen
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
the
day
after
Wyat
's
defeat
,
she
do
the
most
cruel
act
,
even
of
her
cruel
reign
,
in
sign
the
warrant
for
the
execution
of
Lady
Jane
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
They
try
to
persuade
Lady
Jane
to
accept
the
unreformed
religion
;
but
she
steadily
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
morning
when
she
be
to
die
,
she
see
from
her
window
the
bleeding
and
headless
body
of
her
husband
bring
back
in
a
cart
from
the
scaffold
on
Tower
Hill
where
he
have
lay
down
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
have
decline
to
see
him
before
his
execution
,
lest
she
should
be
overpower
and
not
make
a
good
end
,
so
,
she
even
now
show
a
constancy
and
calmness
that
will
never
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
up
to
the
scaffold
with
a
firm
step
and
a
quiet
face
,
and
address
the
bystander
in
a
steady
voice
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
numerous
;
for
she
be
too
young
,
too
innocent
and
fair
,
to
be
murder
before
the
people
on
Tower
Hill
,
as
her
husband
have
just
be
;
so
,
the
place
of
her
execution
be
within
the
Tower
itself
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
that
she
have
do
an
unlawful
act
in
take
what
be
<EOS>
Queen
Mary
's
right
;
but
that
she
have
do
so
with
no
bad
intent
,
and
that
she
die
a
humble
Christian
.
 
<EOS>
She
beg
the
executioner
to
despatch
her
quickly
,
and

He

and

She

<EOS>
They

to

and
scornfully

and
pass
into
the
Tower

and

down
in
a
court
-
yard
on
a
stone
.
 
<EOS>
They
besought
her
to
come
in
out
of
the
wet

but
she
answer
that
it
be
better
sit

<EOS>
at
length
she
go
to
her
apartment
,
where
she
be
keep
a
prisoner
,
though
not
so
close
a

as

a
milkmaid

<EOS>
Gardiner
,
than
whom
there
be
not
many
bad
man
among
the
fierce
and
sullen
priest
,
care
little
to
keep
secret
his
stern
desire
for
her
death
:
 
be
use
to
say
that
it
be
of
little
service
to
shake
off
the
leave
,
and
lop
the
branch
of
the
tree
of
heresy
,
if
its
root
,
the
hope
of
heretic

be
leave
.
 
<EOS>
He

in

<EOS>
Elizabeth

;
and
Hatfield
House
be
assign
to
her
as
a
residence
,
under
the
care
of
one
SIR
THOMAS
POPE
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
Philip
,
the
Prince
of
Spain
,
be
a
main
cause
of
this
change
in
Elizabeth
's
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
an
amiable
man
,
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
proud
,
overbearing
,
and
gloomy
;
but
he
and
the
spanish
lord
who
come
over
with
him
,
assuredly
do
discountenance
the
idea
of
do
any
violence
to
the
Princess
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
mere
prudence
,
but
we
will
hope
it
be
manhood
and
honour
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
be
expect
her
husband
with
great
impatience
,
and
at
length
he
come
,
to
her
great
joy
,
though
he

care
much
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
marry
by
Gardiner
,
at
Winchester
,
and
there
be
more
holiday
-
making
among
the
people
;
but
they
have
their
old
distrust
of
this
spanish
marriage
,
in
which
even
the
Parliament
share
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
member
of
that
Parliament
be
far
from
honest
,
and
be
strongly
suspect
to
have
be
buy
with
spanish
money
,
they
would
pass
no
bill
to
enable
the
Queen
to
set
aside
the
Princess
Elizabeth
and
appoint
her
own
successor
.
  
<EOS>
although
Gardiner
fail
in
this
object
,
as
well
as
in
the
dark
one
of

the
Princess
to
the
scaffold
,
he
go
on
at
a
great
pace
in
the
revival
of
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
a
new
Parliament
be
pack
,
in
which
there
be
no

<EOS>
preparation
be
make
to

bring
his
holy
declaration
that
all
the
nobility
who
have
acquire
Church
property
,
should
keep
it
---
which
be
do
to
enlist
their
selfish
interest
on
the
Pope
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
then
a
great
scene
be
enact
,
which
be
the
triumph
of
the
Queen
's
plan
.
 
<EOS>
Cardinal
Pole
arrive
in
great
splendour
and
dignity
,
and
be
receive
with
great
pomp
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
join
in
a
petition
expressive
of
their
sorrow
at
the
change
in
the
national
religion
,
and
pray
him
to
receive
the
country

into
the
Popish
Church
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
Queen

on
her

,
and
the

side
of

,
and
the
Cardinal

the
other
,
and
the
Parliament
present
,
Gardiner
read
the
petition
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
the
Cardinal
then
make
a
great
speech
,
and
be
so
obliging
as
to
say
that
all
be
forget
and
forgive
,
and
that
the
kingdom
be
solemnly
make
roman
Catholic
again
.
  
<EOS>
everything

<EOS>
the

and
that

burning
,
the
Council
know
pretty
well
what

He

soon

His

and
there

a
great
concourse
of
spectator
in

when

when

work

even
in
his

Gardiner

tired
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Cranmer
be
now
degrade
as
a
priest
,
and
leave
for
death
;
but
,
if
the
Queen
hate
any
one
on
earth
,
she
hate
him
,
and
it
be
resolve
that
he
should
be
ruin
and
disgrace
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
Queen
and
her
husband
personally
urge
on
these
deed
,
because
they
write
to
the
Council
,
urge
them
to
be
active
in
the
kindling
of
the
fearful
fire
.
 
<EOS>
as
Cranmer
be
know
not
to
be
a
firm
man
,
a
plan
be
lay
for
surround
him
with
artful
people
,
and
induce
him
to
recant
to
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
dean
and
friar
visit
him
,
play
at
bowl
with
him
,
show
him
various
attention
,
talk
persuasively
with
him
,
give
him
money
for
his
prison
comfort
,
and
induce
him
to
sign
,
I
fear
,
as
many
as
six
recantation
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
,
after
all
,
he
be
take
out
to
be
burn
,
he
be
nobly
true
to
his
well
self
,
and
make
a
glorious
end
.
  
<EOS>
after
prayer
and
a
sermon
,
Dr.
Cole
,
the
preacher
of
the
day
(
who
have
be
one
of
the
artful
priest
about
Cranmer
in
prison
)
,
require
him
to
make
a
public
confession
of
his
faith
before
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
Cole
do
,
expect
that
he
would
declare
himself
a
Roman
Catholic
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
a
profession
of
my
faith
,
"
say
Cranmer
,
"
and
with
a
good
will
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
he
arise
before
them
all
,
and
take
from
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
a
write
prayer
and
read
it
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
he
kneel
and
say
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
all
the
people
join
;
and
then
he
arise
again
and
tell
them
that
he
believe
in
the
Bible
,
and
that
in
what
he
have
lately
write
,
he
have
write
what
be
not
the
truth
,
and
that
,
because
his
right
hand
have
sign
those
paper
,
he
would
burn
his
right
hand
first
when
he
come
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
Pope
,
he
do
refuse
him
and
denounce
him
as
the
enemy
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
the
pious
Dr.
Cole
cry
out
to
the
guard
to
stop
that
heretic
's
mouth
and
take
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
take
him
away
,
and
chain
him
to
the
stake
,
where
he
hastily
take
off
his
own
clothe
to
make
ready
for
the
flame
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
stand
before
the
people
with
a
bald
head
and
a
white
and
flow
beard
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
firm
now
when
the
bad
be
come
,
that
he
again
declare
against
his
recantation
,
and
be
so
impressive
and
so
undismayed
,
that
a
certain
lord
,
who
be
one
of
the
director
of
the
execution
,
call
out
to
the
man
to
make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
when
the
fire
be
light
,
Cranmer
,
true
to
his
late
word
,
stretch
out
his
right
hand
,
and
cry
out
,
"
this
hand
hath
offend
!
"
hold
it
among
the
flame
,
until
it
blaze
and
burn
away
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
be
find
entire
among
his
ashe
,
and
he
leave
at
last
a
memorable
name
in
english
history
.
 
<EOS>
Cardinal
Pole
celebrate
the
day
by
say
his
first
mass
,
and
next
day
he
be
make
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
in
Cranmer

place
.
  
<EOS>
the
Queen
's
husband
,
who
be
now
mostly
abroad
in
his
own
dominion
,
and
generally
make
a
coarse
jest
of
her
to
his
more
familiar
courtier
,
be
at
war
with
France
,
and
come
over
to
seek
the
assistance
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
England
be
very
unwilling
to
engage
in
a
french
war
for
his
sake
;
but
it
happen
that
the
King
of
France
,
at
this
very
time
,
aid
a
descent
upon
the
english
coast
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
war
be
declare
,
greatly
to
Philip
's
satisfaction
;
and
the
Queen
raise
a
sum
of
money
with
which
to
carry
it
on
,
by
every
unjustifiable
mean
in
her
power

It

no
profitable
return
,
for
the
french
Duke
of
Guise
surprise
Calais

and
the
English
sustain
a
complete
defeat

<EOS>
the
loss
they
meet
with
in
France
greatly
mortify
the
national
pride
,
and
the
Queen
never
recover
the
blow
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
bad
fever
rage
in
England
at
this
time

I
be
glad
to
write

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Cardinal

<EOS>
as
bloody
QUEEN
MARY

this
woman
have
become
famous
,
and
as
bloody
QUEEN
MARY
,
she
will
ever
be
justly
remember
with
horror
and
detestation
in
Great
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
Her
memory
have
be
hold
in
such
abhorrence
that
some
writer
have
arise
in
later
year
to
take
her
part
,
and
to
show
that
she
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
quite
an
amiable
and
cheerful
sovereign
!
 
<EOS>
"
by
their
fruit
ye
shall
know
them
,
"
say
our
SAVIOUR
.
 
<EOS>
the
stake
and
the
fire
be
the
fruit
of
this
reign
,
and
you
will
judge
this
Queen
by
nothing
else
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Elizabeth
    
there
be
great
rejoice
all
over
the
land
when
the
Lords
of
the
Council
go
down
to
Hatfield
,
to
hail
the
Princess
Elizabeth
as
the
new
Queen
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Weary
of
the
barbarity
of
Mary
's
reign
,
the
people
look
with
hope
and
gladness
to
the
new
Sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
the
nation
seem
to
wake
from
a
horrible
dream
;
and
Heaven
,
so
long
hide
by
the
smoke
of
the
fire
that
roast
man
and
woman
to
death
,
appear
to
brighten
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
Queen
Elizabeth
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
of
age
when
she
ride
through
the
street
of
London
,
from
the
Tower
to
Westminster
Abbey
,
to
be
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Her
countenance
be
strongly
mark
,
but
on
the
whole
,
command
and
dignified
;
her
hair
be
red
,
and
her
nose
something
too
long
and
sharp
for
a
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
the
beautiful
creature
her
courtier
make
out
;
but
she
be
well
enough
,
and
no
doubt
look
all
the
well
for
come
after
the
dark
and
gloomy
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
well
educate
,
but
a
roundabout
writer
,
and
rather
a
hard
swearer
and
coarse
talker
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
clever
,
but
cunning
and
deceitful
,
and
inherit
much
of
her
father
's
violent
temper
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
this
now
,
because
she
have
be
so
over
-
praise
by
one
party
,
and
so
over
-
abuse
by
another
,
that
it
be
hardly
possible
to
understand
the
great
part
of
her
reign
without
first
understanding
what
kind
of
woman
she
really
be
.
  
<EOS>
She
begin
her
reign
with
the
great
advantage
of
have
a
very
wise
and
careful
Minister
,
SIR
WILLIAM
CECIL
,
whom
she
afterwards
make
LORD
BURLEIGH
.
 
<EOS>
altogether
,
the
people
have
great
reason
for
rejoice
than
they
usually
have
,
when
there
be
procession
in
the
street
;
and
they
be
happy
with
some
reason
.
 
<EOS>
all
kind
of
show
and
image
be
set
up
;
GOG
and
MAGOG
be
hoist
to
the
top
of
Temple
Bar
,
and
(
which
be
more
to
the
purpose
)
<EOS>
the
Corporation
dutifully
present
the
young
Queen
with
the
sum
of
a
thousand
mark
in
gold
---
so
heavy
a
present
,
that
she
be
oblige
to
take
it
into
her
carriage
with
both
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
coronation
be
a
great
success
;
and
,
on
the
next
day
,
one
of
the
courtier
present
a
petition
to
the
new
Queen
,
pray
that
as
it
be
the
custom
to
release
some
prisoner
on
such
occasion
,
she
would
have
the
goodness
to
release
the
four
evangelist
,
Matthew
,
Mark
,
Luke
,
and
John
,
and
also
the
Apostle
Saint
Paul
,
who
have
be
for
some
time
shut
up
in
a
strange
language
so
that
the
people
could
not
get
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
,
the
Queen
reply
that
it
would
be
better
first
to
inquire
of
themselves
whether
they
desire
to
be
release
or
not
;
and
,
as
a
means
of
find
out
,
a
great
public
discussion
---
a
sort
of
religious
tournament
---
be
appoint
to
take
place
between
certain
champion
of
the
two
religion
,
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
that
it
be
soon
make
pretty
clear
to
common
sense
,
that
for
people
to
benefit
by
what
they
repeat
or
read
,
it
be
rather
necessary
they
should
understand
something
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
a
Church
Service
in
plain
English
be
settle
,
and
other
law
and
regulation
be
make
,
completely
establish
the
great
work
of
the
Reformation
.
 
<EOS>
the
romish
bishop
and
champion
be
not
harshly
deal
with
,
all
thing
consider
;
and
the
Queen
's
Ministers
be
both
prudent
and
merciful
.
  
<EOS>
the
one
great
trouble
of
this
reign
,
and
the
unfortunate
cause
of
the
great
part
of
such
turmoil
and
bloodshed
as
occur
in
it
,
be
MARY
STUART
,
QUEEN
of
SCOTS
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
try
to
understand
,
in
as
few
word
as
possible
,
who
Mary
be
,
what
she
be
,
and
how
she
come
to
be
a
thorn
in
the
royal
pillow
of
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
the
daughter
of
the
Queen
Regent
of
Scotland
,
MARY
of
GUISE
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
marry
,
when
a
mere
child
,
to
the
Dauphin
,
the
son
and
heir
of
the
King
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
the
Pope
,
who
pretend
that
no
one
could
rightfully
wear
the
crown
of
England
without
his
gracious
permission
,
be
strongly
opposed
to
Elizabeth
,
who
have
not
ask
for
the
said
gracious
permission
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
would
have
inherit
the
english
crown
in
right
of
her
birth
,
suppose
the
English
Parliament
not
to
have
alter
the
succession
,
the
Pope
himself
,
and
most
of
the
discontent
who
be
follower
of
his
,
maintain
that
Mary
be
the
rightful
Queen
of
England
,
and
Elizabeth
the
wrongful
queen
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
so
closely
connected
with
France
,
and
France
be
jealous
of
England
<EOS>
,
there
be
far
great
danger
in
this
than
there
would
have
be
if
she
have
have
no
alliance
with
that
great
power
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
her
young
husband
,
on
the
death
of
his
father
,
become
franci
the
second
,
King
of
France
,
the
matter
grow
very
serious
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
the
young
couple
style
themselves
King
and
Queen
of
England
,
and
the
Pope
be
dispose
to
help
them
by
do
all
the
mischief
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
reform
religion
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
stern
and
powerful
preacher
,
name
JOHN
KNOX
,
and
other
such
man
,
have
be
make
fierce
progress
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
still
a
half
savage
country
,
where
there
be
a
great
deal
of
murdering
and
rioting
continually
go
on
;
and
the
Reformers
,
instead
of
reform
those
evil
as
they
should
have
do
<EOS>
,
go
to
work
in
the
ferocious
old
scottish
spirit
,
lay
church
and
chapel
waste
,
pull
down
picture
and
altar
,
and
knock
about
the
Grey
Friars
,
and
the
Black
Friars
,
and
the
White
Friars
,
and
the
friar
of
all
sort
of
colour
,
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
this
obdurate
and
harsh
spirit
of
the
Scottish
Reformers
<EOS>
(
the
Scotch
have
always
be
rather
a
sullen
and
frown
people
in
religious
matter
)
<EOS>
put
up
the
blood
of
the
romish
french
court
,
and
cause
France
to
send
troop
over
to
Scotland
,
with
the
hope
of
set
the
friar
of
all
sort
of
colour
on
their
leg
again
;
of
conquer
that
country
first
,
and
England
afterwards
;
and
so
crush
the
Reformation
all
to
piece
.
<EOS>
the
Scottish
Reformers
,
who
have
form
a
great
league
which
they
call
the
Congregation
of
the
Lord
,
secretly
represent
to
Elizabeth
that
,
if
the
reform
religion
get
the
bad
of
it
with
them
,
it
would
be
likely
to
get
the
bad
of
it
in
England
too
;
and
thus
,
Elizabeth
,
though
she
have
a
high
notion
of
the
right
of
king
and
Queens
to
do
anything
they
like
,
send
an
army
to
Scotland
to
support
the
Reformers
,
who
be
in
arm
against
their
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
proceeding
lead
to
a
treaty
of
peace
at
Edinburgh
,
under
which
the
French
consent
to
depart
from
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
by
a
separate
treaty

Mary
and
her
young
husband
engage
to
renounce
their
assume
title
of
King
and
Queen
of
England

<EOS>
but
this
treaty
they
never

<EOS>
It
happen

soon
after

this
state

that
the

leave
Mary

She

after

the
french
coast
be
still
visible
,
that
she
may
behold
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
prove
to
be
a
clear
morning
,
this
be
do
,
and
she
again
weep
for
the
country
she
be
leave
,
and
say
many
time
,
"
Farewell
,
France
!
<EOS>
Farewell
,
France
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
see
thee
again
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
long
remember
afterwards
,
as
sorrowful
and
interesting
in
a
fair
young
princess
of
nineteen
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
afraid
it
gradually
come
,
together
with
her
other
distress
,
to
surround
her
with
great
sympathy
than
she
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
Scotland
,
and
take
up
her
abode
at
the
palace
of
Holyrood
in
Edinburgh
,
she
find
herself
among
uncouth
stranger
and
wild
uncomfortable
custom
very
different
from
her
experience
in
the
court
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
people
who
be
dispose
to
love
her
,
make
her
head
ache
when
she
be
tired
out
by
her
voyage
,
with
a
serenade
of
discordant
music
---
a
fearful
concert
of
bagpipe
,
I
suppose
---
and
bring
her
and
her
train
home
to
her
palace
on
miserable
little
Scotch
horse
that
appear
to
be
half
starve
.
<EOS>
among
the
people
who
be
not
dispose
to
love
her
,
she
find
the
powerful
leader
of
the
Reformed
Church
,
who
be
bitter
upon
her
amusement
,
however
innocent
,
and
denounce
music
and
dancing
as
work
of
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
John
Knox
himself
often
lecture
her
,
violently
and
angrily
,
and
do
much
to
make
her
life
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
reason
confirm
her
old
attachment
to
the
romish
religion
,
and
cause
her
,
there
be
no
doubt
,
most
imprudently
and
dangerously
both
for
herself
and
for
England
too
,
to
give
a
solemn
pledge
to
the
head
of
the
Romish
Church
that
if
she
ever
succeed
to
the
english
crown
,
she
would
set
up
that
religion
again
.
 
<EOS>
in
read
her
unhappy
history
,
you
must
always
remember
this
;
and
also
that
during
her
whole
life
she
be
constantly
put
forward
against
the
Queen
,
in
some
form
or
other
,
by
the
Romish
party
.
  
<EOS>
that
Elizabeth
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
not
incline
to
like
her
,
be
pretty
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
very
vain
and
jealous
,
and
have
an
extraordinary
dislike
to
people
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
She
treat
Lady
Catherine
Grey
,
sister
of
the
behead
Lady
Jane
,
with
such
shameful
severity
,
for
no
other
reason
than
her
be
secretly
married
,
that
she
die
and
her
husband
be
ruin
;
so
,
when
a
second
marriage
for
Mary
begin
to
be
talk
about
,
probably
Elizabeth
dislike
her
more
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
Elizabeth
want
suitor
of
her
own
,
for
they
start
up
from
Spain
,
Austria
,
Sweden
,
and
England
.
 
<EOS>
Her
English
lover
at
this
time
,
and
one
whom
she
much
favour
too
,
be
LORD
ROBERT
DUDLEY
,
Earl
of
Leicester
---
himself
secretly
marry
to
AMY
ROBSART
,
the
daughter
of
an
english
gentleman
,
whom
he
be
strongly
suspect
of
cause
to
be
murder
,
down
at
his
country
seat
,
Cumnor
Hall
in
Berkshire
,
that
he
may
be
free
to
marry
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
story
,
the
great
writer
,
SIR
WALTER
SCOTT
,
have
found
one
of
his
good
romance
.
<EOS>
but
if
Elizabeth
know
how
to
lead
her
handsome
favourite
on
,
for
her
own
vanity
and
pleasure
,
she
know
how
to
stop
him
for
her
own
pride
;
and
his
love
,
and
all
the
other
proposal
,
come
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
always
declare
in
good
set
speech
,
that
she
would
never
be
marry
at
all
,
but
would
live
and
die
a
Maiden
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
pleasant
and
meritorious
declaration
,
I
suppose
;
but
it
have
be
puff
and
trumpet
so
much
,
that
I
be
rather
tired
of
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
diver
prince
propose
to
marry
Mary
,
but
the
english
court
have
reason
for
be
jealous
of
them
all
,
and
even
propose
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
she
should
marry
that
very
Earl
of
Leicester
who
have
aspire
to
be
the
husband
of
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
LORD
DARNLEY
,
son
of
the
Earl
of
Lennox
,
and
himself
descend
from
the
Royal
Family
of
Scotland
,
go
over
with
Elizabeth
's
consent
to
try
his
fortune
at
Holyrood
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
simpleton
;
and
could
dance
and
play
the
guitar
;
but
I
know
of
nothing
else
he
could
do
,
unless
it
be
to
get
very
drunk
,
and
eat
gluttonously
,
and
make
a
contemptible
spectacle
of
himself
in
many
mean
and
vain
way
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
gain
Mary
's
heart
,
not
disdain
in
the
pursuit
of
his
object
to
ally
himself
with
one
of
her
secretary
,
DAVID
RIZZIO
,
who
have
great
influence
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
marry
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
this
marriage
do
not
say
much
for
her
,
but
what
follow
will
presently
say
less
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
brother
,
the
EARL
of
MURRAY
,
and
head
of
the
protestant
party
in
Scotland
,
have
oppose
this
marriage
,
partly
on
religious
ground
,
and
partly
perhaps
from
personal
dislike
of
the
very
contemptible
bridegroom
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
have
take
place
,
through
Mary
's
gain
over
to
it
the
more
powerful
of
the
lord
about
her
,
she
banish
Murray
for
his
pain
;
and
,
when
he
and
some
other
noble
rise
in
arm
to
support
the
reform
religion
,
she
herself
,
within
a
month
of
her
wedding
day
,
ride
against
them
in
armour
with
loaded
pistol
in
her
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
drive
out
of
Scotland
,
they
present
themselves
before
Elizabeth
---
who
call
them
traitor
in
public
,
and
assist
them
in
private
,
accord
to
her
crafty
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
be
marry
but
a
little
while
,
when
she
begin
to
hate
her
husband
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
begin
to
hate
that
David
Rizzio
,
with
whom
he
have
league
to
gain
her
favour
,
and
whom
he
now
believe
to
be
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
He
hate
Rizzio
to
that
extent
,
that
he
make
a
compact
with
LORD
RUTHVEN
and
three
other
lord
to
get
rid
of
him
by
murder
.
 
<EOS>
this
wicked
agreement
they
make
in
solemn
secrecy
upon
the
first
of
March
,
fifteen
hundred
and
sixty
-
six
,
and
on
the
night
of
Saturday
the
ninth
,
the
conspirator
be
bring
by
Darnley
up
a
private
staircase
,
dark
and
steep
,
into
a
range
of
room
where
they
know
that
Mary
be
sit
at
supper
with
her
sister
,
Lady
Argyle
,
and
this
doom
man
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
go
into
the
room
,
Darnley
take
the
Queen
round
the
waist
,
and
Lord
Ruthven
,
who
have
rise
from
a
bed
of
sickness
to
do
this
murder
,
come
in
,
gaunt
and
ghastly
,
lean
on
two
man
.
 
<EOS>
Rizzio
run
behind
the
Queen
for
shelter
and
protection
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
him
come
out
of
the
room
,
"
say
Ruthven
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
leave
the
room
,
"
reply
the
Queen
;
"
I
read
his
danger
in
your
face
,
and
it
be
my
will
that
he
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"
They
then
set
upon
him
,
struggle
with
him
,
overturn
the
table
,
drag
him
out
,
and
kill
him
with
fifty
-
six
stab
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Queen
hear
that
he
be
dead
,
she
say
,
"
no
more
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
think
now
of
revenge
!
"
  
<EOS>
within
a
day
or
two
,
she
gain
her
husband
over
,
and
prevail
on
the
tall
idiot
to
abandon
the
conspirator
and
fly
with
her
to
Dunbar
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
issue
a
proclamation
,
audaciously
and
falsely
deny
that
he
have
any
knowledge
of
the
late
bloody
business
;
and
there
they
be
join
by
the
EARL
BOTHWELL
and
some
other
noble
.
<EOS>
with
their
help
,
they
raise
eight
thousand
man
;
return
to
Edinburgh
,
and
drive
the
assassin
into
England
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
soon
afterwards
give
birth
to
a
son
---
still
think
of
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
that
she
should
have
have
a
great
scorn
for
her
husband
after
his
late
cowardice
and
treachery
than
she
have
have
before
,
be
natural
enough
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
little
doubt
that
she
now
begin
to
love
Bothwell
instead
,
and
to
plan
with
him
mean
of
get
rid
of
Darnley
.
<EOS>
Bothwell
have
such
power
over
her
that
he
induce
her
even
to
pardon
the
assassin
of
Rizzio
.
 
<EOS>
the
arrangement
for
the
Christening
of
the
young
Prince
be
entrust
to
him
,
and
he
be
one
of
the
most
important
people
at
the
ceremony
,
where
the
child
be
name
JAMES
:
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
his
godmother
,
though
not
present
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
a
week
afterwards
,
Darnley
,
who
have
leave
Mary
and
go
to
his
father
's
house
at
Glasgow
,
be
take
ill
with
the
small
-
pox
,
she
send
her
own
physician
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
reason
to
apprehend
that
this
be
merely
a
show
and
a
pretence
,
and
that
she
know
what
be
do
,
when
Bothwell
within
another
month
propose
to
one
of
the
late
conspirator
against
Rizzio
,
to
murder
Darnley
,
"
for
that
it
be
the
Queen
's
mind
that
he
should
be
take
away
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
certain
that
on
that
very
day
she
write
to
her
ambassador
in
France
,
complain
of
him
,
and
yet
go
immediately
to
Glasgow
,
feign
to
be
very
anxious
about
him
,
and
to
love
him
very
much
.
<EOS>
if
she
want
to
get
him
in
her
power
,
she
succeed
to
her
heart
's
content
;
for
she
induce
him
to
go
back
with
her
to
Edinburgh
,
and
to
occupy
,
instead
of
the
palace
,
a
lone
house
outside
the
city
call
the
Kirk
of
Field
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
he
live
for
about
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
one
Sunday
night
,
she
remain
with
him
until
ten
o'clock
,
and
then
leave
him
,
to
go
to
Holyrood
to
be
present
at
an
entertainment
give
in
celebration
of
the
marriage
of
one
of
her
favourite
servant
.
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
city
be
shake
by
a
great
explosion
,
and
the
Kirk
of
Field
be
blow
to
atom
.
  
<EOS>
Darnley
's
body
be
find
next
day
lie
under
a
tree
at
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
come
there
,
undisfigured
and
unscorche
by
gunpowder
,
and
how
this
crime
come
to
be
so
clumsily
and
strangely
committed
,
it
be
impossible
to
discover
.
 
<EOS>
the
deceitful
character
of
Mary
,
and
the
deceitful
character
of
Elizabeth
,
have
render
almost
every
part
of
their
joint
history
uncertain
and
obscure
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
fear
that
Mary
be
unquestionably
a
party
to
her
husband
's
murder
,
and
that
this
be
the
revenge
she
have
threaten
.
 
<EOS>
the
Scotch
people
universally
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
voice
cry
out
in
the
street
of
Edinburgh
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
for
justice
on
the
murderess
.
 
<EOS>
placard
be
post
by
unknown
hand
in
the
public
place
denounce
Bothwell
as
the
murderer
,
and
the
Queen
as
his
accomplice
;
and
,
when
he
afterwards
marry
her
(
though
himself
already
marry
)
,
previously
make
a
show
of
take
her
prisoner
by
force
,
the
indignation
of
the
people
know
no
bound
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
particularly
be
describe
as
have
be
quite
frantic
against
the
Queen
,
and
to
have
hoot
and
cry
after
her
in
the
street
with
terrific
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
such
guilty
union
seldom
prosper
.
 
<EOS>
this
husband
and
wife
have
live
together
but
<EOS>
a
month
,
when
they
be
separate
for
ever
by
the
success
of
a
band
of
Scotch
noble
who
associate
against
them
for
the
protection
of
the
young
Prince
:
 
whom
Bothwell
have
vainly
endeavour
to
lay
hold
of
,
and
whom
he
would
certainly
have
murder
,
if
the
EARL
of
MAR
,
in
whose
hand
the
boy
be
,
have
not
be
firmly
and
honourably
faithful
to
his
trust
.
 
<EOS>
before
this
angry
power
,
Bothwell
flee
abroad
,
where
he
die
,
a
prisoner
and
mad
,
nine
miserable
year
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
be
find
by
the
associate
lord
to
deceive
them
at
every
turn
,
be
send
a
prisoner
to
Lochleven
Castle
;
which
,
as
it
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
lake
,
could
only
be
approach
by
boat
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
one
LORD
lindsay
,
who
be
so
much
of
a
brute
that
the
noble
would
have
do
better
if
they
have
choose
a
mere
gentleman
for
their
messenger
,
make
her
sign
her
abdication
,
and
appoint
Murray
,
Regent
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
Murray
see
her
in
a
sorrowing
and
humble
state
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
better
have
remain
in
the
castle
of
Lochleven
,
dull
prison
as
it
be
,
with
the
rippling
of
the
lake
against
it
,
and
the
move
shadow
of
the
water
on
the
room
wall
;
but
she
could
not
rest
there
,
and
more
than
once
try
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
time
she
have
nearly
succeed
,
dress
in
the
clothe
of
her
own
washer
-
woman
,
but
,
put
up
her
hand
to
prevent
one
of
the
boatman
from
lift
her
veil
,
the
man
suspect
her
,
see
how
white
it
be
,
and
row
her
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
a
short
time
afterwards
,
her
fascinating
manner
enlist
in
her
cause
a
boy
in
the
Castle
,
call
the
little
DOUGLAS
,
who
,
while
the
family
be
at
supper
,
steal
the
key
of
the
great
gate
,
go
softly
out
with
the
Queen
,
lock
the
gate
on
the
outside
,
and
row
her
away
across
the
lake
,
sink
the
key
as
they
go
along
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
opposite
shore
she
be
meet
by
another
Douglas
,
and
some
few
lord
;
and
,
so
accompanied
,
ride
away
on
horseback
to
Hamilton
,
where
they
raise
three
thousand
man
.
<EOS>
here
,
she
issue
a
proclamation
declare
that
the
abdication
she
have
sign
in
her
prison
be
illegal
,
and
require
the
regent
to
yield
to
his
lawful
queen
.
 
<EOS>
be
a
steady
soldier
,
and
in
no
way
discompose
although
he
be
without
an
army
,
Murray
pretend
to
treat
with
her
,
until
he
have
collect
a
force
about
half
equal
to
her
own
,
and
then
he
give
her
battle
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
quarter
of
an
hour
he
cut
down
all
her
hope
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
another
weary
ride
on
horse
-

of

long
Scotch
mile

and
take
shelter
at
Dundrennan
Abbey
,
whence
she
flee
for
safety
to
Elizabeth
's
dominion
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
come
to
England
---
to
her
own
ruin
,
the
trouble
of
the
kingdom
,
and
the
misery
and
death
of
many
---
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
sixty
-
eight
.
 
<EOS>
how
she
leave
it
and
the
world
,
nineteen
year
afterwards
,
we
have
now
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
when
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
arrive
in
England
,
without
money
and
even
without
any
other
clothe
than
those
she
wear
,
she
write
to
Elizabeth
,
represent
herself
as
an
innocent
and
injured
piece
of
Royalty
,
and
entreat
her
assistance
to
oblige
her
scottish
subject
to
take
her
back
again
and
obey
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
her
character
be
already
know
in
England
to
be
a
very
different
one
from
what
she
make
it
out
to
be
,
she
be
tell
in
answer
that
she
must
first
clear
herself
.
 
<EOS>
make
uneasy
by
this
condition
,
Mary
,
rather
than
stay
in
England
,
would
have
go
to
Spain
,
or
to
France
,
or
would
even
have
go
back
to
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
her
do
either
would
have
be
likely
to
trouble
England
afresh
,
it
be
decide
that
she
should
be
detain
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
first
come
to
Carlisle
,
and
,
after
that
,
be
move
about
from
castle
to
castle
,
as
be
consider
necessary
;
but
England
she
never
leave
again
.
  
<EOS>
after
try
very
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
necessity
of
clear
herself
,
Mary
,
advise
by
LORD
HERRIES
,
her
good
friend
in
England
,
agree
to
answer
the
charge
against
her
,
if
the
scottish
nobleman
who
make
them
would
attend
to
maintain
them
before
such
english
nobleman
as
Elizabeth
may
appoint
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
such
an
assembly
,
under
the
name
of
a
conference
,
meet
,
first
at
York
,
and
afterwards
at
Hampton
Court
.
 
<EOS>
in
its
presence
Lord
Lennox
,
Darnley
's
father
,
openly
charge
Mary
with
the
murder
of
his
son
;
and
whatever
Mary
's
friend
may
now
say
or
write
in
her
behalf
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
,
when
her
brother
Murray
produce
against
her
a
casket
contain
certain
guilty
letter
and
verse
which
he
state
to
have
pass
between
her
and
Bothwell
,
she
withdraw
from
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
it
be
to
be
suppose
that
she
be
then
consider
guilty
by
those
who
have
the
good
opportunity
of
judging
of
the
truth
,
and
that
the
feeling
which
afterwards
arise
in
her
behalf
be
a
very
generous
but
not
a
very
reasonable
one
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
DUKE
of
NORFOLK
,
an
honourable
but
rather
weak
nobleman
,
partly
because
Mary
be
captivate
,
partly
because
he
be
ambitious
,
partly
because
he
be
over
-
persuade
by
artful
plotter
against
Elizabeth
,
conceive
a
strong
idea
that
he
would
like
to
marry
the
Queen
of
Scots
---
though
he
be
a
little
frightened
,
too
,
by
the
letter
in
the
casket
.
 
<EOS>
this
idea
be
secretly
encourage
by
some
of
the
nobleman
of
Elizabeth
's
court
,
and
even
by
the
favourite
Earl
of
Leicester
(
because
it
be
object
to
by
other
favourite
who
be
his
rival
)
,
Mary
express
her
approval
of
it
,
and
the
King
of
France
and
the
King
of
Spain
be
suppose
to
have
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
quietly
plan
,
though
,
but
that
it
come
to
Elizabeth
's
ear
,
who
warn
the
Duke
"
to
be
careful
what
sort
of
pillow
he
be
go
to
lay
his
head
upon
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
humble
reply
at
the
time
;
but
turn
sulky
soon
afterwards
,
and
,
be
consider
dangerous
,
be
send
to
the
Tower
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
from
the
moment
of
Mary
be
come
to
England
<EOS>
she
begin
to
be
the
centre
of
plot
and
misery
.
  
<EOS>
a
rise
of
the
Catholics
in
the
north
be
the
next
of
these
,
and
it
be
only
check
by
many
execution
and
much
bloodshed
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
follow
by
a
great
conspiracy
of
the
Pope
and
some
of
the
catholic
sovereign
of
Europe
to
depose
Elizabeth
,
place
Mary
on
the
throne
,
and
restore
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
to
doubt
that
Mary
know
and
approve
of
this
;
and
the
Pope
himself
be
so
hot
in
the
matter
that
he
issue
a
bull
,
in
which
he
openly
call
Elizabeth
the
"
pretended
Queen
"
of
England
,
excommunicate
her
,
and
excommunicate
all
her
subject
who
should
continue
to
obey
her
.
 
<EOS>
a
copy
of
this
miserable
paper
get
into
London
,
and
be
find
one
morning
publicly
post
on
the
Bishop
of
London
's
gate
.
<EOS>
a
great
hue
and
cry
be
raise
<EOS>
,
another
copy
be
find
in
the
chamber
of
a
student
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
who
confess
,
be
put
upon
the
rack
,
that
he
have
receive
it
from
one
JOHN
FELTON
,
a
rich
gentleman
who
live
across
the
Thames
,
near
Southwark
.
 
<EOS>
this
John
Felton
,
be
put
upon
the
rack
too
,
confess
that
he
have
post
the
placard
on
the
Bishop
's
gate
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
offence
he
be
,
within
four
day
,
take
to
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
and
there
hanged
and
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
Pope
's
bull
,
the
people
by
the
reformation
have
throw
off
the
Pope
,
do
not
care
much
,
you
may
suppose
,
for
the
Pope
's
throw
off
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
mere
dirty
piece
of
paper
,
and
not
half
so
powerful
as
a
street
ballad
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
when
Felton
be
bring
to
his
trial
,
the
poor
Duke
of
Norfolk
be
release
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
for
him
if
he
have
keep
away
from
the
Tower
evermore
,
and
from
the
snare
that
have
take
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
even
while
he
be
in
that
dismal
place
he
correspond
with
Mary
,
and
as
soon
as
he
be
out
of
it
,
he
begin
to
plot
again
.
 
<EOS>
be
discover
in
correspondence
with
the
Pope
,
with
a
view
to
a
rise
in
England
which
should
force
Elizabeth
to
consent
to
his
marriage
with
Mary
and
to
repeal
the
law
against
the
Catholics
,
he
be
re
-
committed
to
the
Tower
and
bring
to
trial
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
find
guilty
by
the
unanimous
verdict
of
the
Lords
who
try
him
,
and
be
sentence
to
the
block
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
difficult
to
make
out
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
and
between
opposite
account
,
whether
Elizabeth
really
be
a
humane
woman
,
or
desire
to
appear
so
,
or
be
fearful
of
shed
the
blood
of
people
of
great
name
who
be
popular
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
twice
she
command
and
countermand
the
execution
of
this
Duke
,
and
it
do
not
take
place
until
five
month
after
his
trial
.
 
<EOS>
the
scaffold
be
erect
on
Tower
Hill
,
and
there
he
die
like
a
brave
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
refuse
to
have
his
eye
bandage
,
say
that
he
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
death
;
and
he
admit
the
justice
of
his
sentence
,
and
be
much
regret
by
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
although
Mary
have
shrink
at
the
most
important
time
from
disprove
her
guilt
,
she
be
very
careful
never
to
do
anything
that
would
admit
it
.
 
<EOS>
all
such
proposal
as
be
make
to
her
by
Elizabeth
for
her
release
,
require
that
admission
in
some
form
or
other
,
and
therefore
come
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
both
woman
be
artful
and
treacherous
,
and
neither
ever
trust
the
other
,
it
be
not
likely
that
they
could
ever
make
an
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
Parliament
,
aggravate
by
what
the
Pope
have
do
,
make
new
and
strong
law
against
the
spreading
of
the
catholic
religion
in
England
,
and
declare
it
treason
in
any
one
to
say
that
the
Queen
and
her
successor
be
not
the
lawful
sovereign
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
do
more
than
this
,
but
for
Elizabeth
's
moderation
.
  
<EOS>
since
the
Reformation
,
there
have
come
to
be
three
great
sect
of
religious
people
---
or
people
who
call
themselves
so
---
in
England
;
that
be
to
say
,
those
who
belong
to
the
Reformed
Church
,
those
who
belong
to
the
Unreformed
Church
,
and
those
who
be
call
the
Puritans
,
because
they
say
that
they
want
to
have
everything
very
pure
and
plain
in
all
the
Church
service
.
 
<EOS>
these
last
be
for
the
most
part
an
uncomfortable
people
,
who
think
it
highly
meritorious
to
dress
in
a
hideous
manner
,
talk
through
their
nose
,
and
oppose
all
harmless
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
powerful
too
,
and
very
much
in
earnest
,
and
they
be
one
and
all
the
determined
enemy
of
the
Queen
of
Scots
.
 
<EOS>
the
Protestant
feeling
in
England
be
further
strengthen
by
the
tremendous
cruelty
to
which
Protestants
be
expose
in
France
and
in
the
Netherlands
.
 
<EOS>
score
of
thousand
of
them
be
put
to
death
in
those
country
with
every
cruelty
that
can
be
imagine
,
and
at
last
,
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
,
one
of
the
great
barbarity
ever
commit
in
the
world
take
place
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
call
in
history
,
the
massacre
of
saint
BARTHOLOMEW
,
because
it
take
place
on
Saint
Bartholomew
's
Eve
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
fall
on
Saturday
the
twenty
-
third
of
August
.
 
<EOS>
on
that
day
all
the
great
leader
of
the
Protestants
(
who
be
there
call
HUGUENOTS
)
be
assemble
together
,
for
the
purpose
,
as
be
represent
to
them
,
of
do
honour
to
the
marriage
of
their
chief
,
the
young
king
of
Navarre
,
with
the
sister
of
CHARLES
the
NINTH
:
 
a
miserable
young
king
who
then
occupy
the
french
throne
.
 
<EOS>
this
dull
creature
be
make
to
believe
by
his
mother
and
other
fierce
Catholics
about
him
that
the
Huguenots
mean
to
take
his
life
;
and
he
be
persuade
to
give
secret
order
that
,
on
the
tolling
of
a
great
bell
,
they
should
be
fall
upon
by
an
overpower
force
of
armed
man
,
and
slaughter
wherever
they
could
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
appoint
hour
be
close
at
hand
,
the
stupid
wretch
,
tremble
from
head
to
foot
,
be
take
into
a
balcony
by
his
mother
to
see
the
atrocious
work
begin
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
the
bell
toll
,
the
murderer
break
forth
.
 
<EOS>
during
all
that
night
and
the
two
next
day
,
they
break
into
the
house
,
fire
the
house
,
shoot
and
stab
the
Protestants
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
and
fling
their
body
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
shoot
at
in
the
street
as
they
pass
along
,
and
their
blood
run
down
the
gutter
.
<EOS>
upwards
of
ten
thousand
Protestants
be
kill
in
Paris
alone
;
in
all
France
four
or
five
time
that
number
.
 
<EOS>
to
return
thank
to
Heaven
for
these
diabolical
murder
,
the
Pope
and
his
train
actually
go
in
public
procession
at
Rome
,
and
as
if
this
be
not
shame
enough
for
them
,
they
have
a
medal
strike
to
commemorate
the
event
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
comfortable
the
wholesale
murder
be
to
these
high
authority
,
they
have
not
that
soothing
effect
upon
the
doll
-
King
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
happy
to
state
that
he
never
know
a
moment
's
peace
afterwards
;
that
he
be
continually
cry
out
that
he
see
the
Huguenots
cover
with
blood
and
wound
fall
dead
before
him
;
and
that
he
die
within
a
year
,
shriek
and
yell
and
rave
to
that
degree
,
that
if
all
the
Popes
who
have
ever
live
have
be
roll
into
one
,
they
would
not
have
afford
His
guilty
Majesty
the
slight
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
terrible
news
of
the
massacre
arrive
in
England
,
it
make
a
powerful
impression
indeed
upon
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
begin
to
run
a
little
wild
against
the
Catholics
at
about
this
time
,
this
fearful
reason
for
it
,
come
so
soon
after
the
day
of
bloody
Queen
Mary
,
must
be
remember
in
their
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
the
Court
be
not
quite
so
honest
as
the
people
---
but
perhaps
it
sometimes
be
not
.
<EOS>
It
receive
the
french
ambassador
,
with
all
the
lord
and
lady
dress
in
deep
mourning
,
and
keep
a
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
a
proposal
of
marriage
which
he
have
make
to
Elizabeth
only
two
day
before
the
eve
of
Saint
Bartholomew
,
on
behalf
of
the
Duke
of
Alenáon
,
the
french
King
's
brother
,
a
boy
of
seventeen
,
still
go
on
;
while
on
the
other
hand
,
in
her
usual
crafty
way
,
the
Queen
secretly
supply
the
Huguenots
with
money
and
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
for
a
Queen
who
make
all
those
fine
speech
,
of
which
I
have
confess
myself
to
be
rather
tired
,
about
live
and
die
a
Maiden
Queen
<EOS>
,
Elizabeth
be
"
go
"
to
be
marry
pretty
often
.
 
<EOS>
besides
always
have
some
English
favourite
or
other
whom
she
by
turn
encourage
and
swear
at
and
knock
about
---
for
the
maiden
Queen
be
very
free
with
her
fist
---
she
hold
this
French
Duke
off
and
on
through
several
year
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
at
last
come
over
to
England
,
the
marriage
article
be
actually
draw
up
,
and
it
be
settle
that
the
wedding
should
take
place
in
six
week
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
then
so
bent
upon
it
,
that
she
prosecute
a
poor
Puritan
name
STUBBS
,
and
a
poor
bookseller
name
PAGE
,
for
writing
and
publish
a
pamphlet
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
Their
right
hand
be
chop
off
for
this
crime
;
and
poor
Stubbs
---
more
loyal
than
I
should
have
be
myself
under
the
circumstance
---
immediately
pull
off
his
hat
with
his
left
hand
,
and
cry
,
"
God
save
the
Queen
!
"
 
<EOS>
Stubbs
be
cruelly
treat
;
for
the
marriage
never
take
place
after
all
,
though
the
Queen
pledge
herself
to
the
Duke
with
a
ring
from
her
own
finger
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
away
,
no
well
than
he
come
,
when
the
courtship
have
last
some
ten
year
altogether
;
and
he
die
a
couple
of
year
afterwards
,
mourn
by
Elizabeth
,
who
appear
to
have
be
really
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
to
her
credit
,
for
he
be
a
bad
enough
member
of
a
bad
family
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
to
the
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
there
arise
two
order
of
priest
,
who
be
very
busy
in
England
,
and
who
be
much
dread
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
JESUITS
(
who
be
everywhere
in
all
sort
of
disguise
)
,
and
the
SEMINARY
PRIESTS
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
have
a
great
horror
of
the
first
,
because
they
be
know
to
have
teach
that
murder
be
lawful
if
it
be
do
with
an
object
of
which
they
approve
;
and
they
have
a
great
horror
of
the
second
,
because
they
come
to
teach
the
old
religion
,
and
to
be
the
successor
of
"
Queen
Mary
's
priest
,
"
as
those
yet
linger
in
England
be
call
,
when
they
should
die
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
severest
law
be
make
against
them
,
and
be
most
unmercifully
execute
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
shelter
them
in
their
house
often
suffer
heavily
for
what
be
an
act
of
humanity
;
and
the
rack
,
that
cruel
torture
which
tear
man
's
limb
asunder
,
be
constantly
keep
go
.
 
<EOS>
what
these
unhappy
man
confess
,
or
what
be
ever
confess
by
any
one
under
that
agony
,
must
always
be
receive
with
great
doubt
,
as
it
be
certain
that
people
have
frequently
own
to
the
most
absurd
and
impossible
crime
to
escape
such
dreadful
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
doubt
it
to
have
be
prove
by
paper
,
that
there
be
many
plot
,
both
among
the
Jesuits
,
and
with
France
,
and
with
Scotland
,
and
with
Spain
,
for
the
destruction
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
for
the
placing
of
Mary
on
the
throne
,
and
for
the
revival
of
the
old
religion
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
english
people
be
too
ready
to
believe
in
plot
,
there
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
good
reason
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
massacre
of
Saint
Bartholomew
be
yet
fresh
in
their
recollection
,
a
great
protestant
dutch
hero
,
the
PRINCE
of
ORANGE
,
be
shoot
by
an
assassin
,
who
confess
that
he
have
be
keep
and
train
for
the
purpose
in
a
college
of
Jesuits
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dutch
,
in
this
surprise
and
distress
,
offer
to
make
Elizabeth
their
sovereign
,
but
she
decline
the
honour
,
and
send
them
a
small
army
instead
,
under
the
command
of
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
who
,
although
a
capital
Court
favourite
,
be
not
much
of
a
general
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
little
in
Holland
,
that
his
campaign
there
would
probably
have
be
forget
,
but
for
its
occasion
the
death
of
one
of
the
good
writer
,
the
good
knight
,
and
the
good
gentleman
,
of
that
or
any
age
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
SIR
PHILIP
SIDNEY
,
who
be
wound
by
a
musket
ball
in
the
thigh
as
he
mount
a
fresh
horse
,
after
have
have
his
own
kill
under
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
ride
back
wound
,
a
long
distance
,
and
be
very
faint
with
fatigue
and
loss
of
blood
,
when
some
water
,
for
which
he
have
eagerly
ask
,
be
hand
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
so
good
and
gentle
even
then
,
that
see
a
poor
badly
wound
common
soldier
lie
on
the
ground
,
look
at
the
water
with
longing
eye
,
he
say
,
"
thy
necessity
be
great
than
mine
,
"
and
give
it
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
touching
action
of
a
noble
heart
be
perhaps
as
well
know
as
any
incident
in
history
---
be
as
famous
far
and
wide
as
the
blood
-
stain
Tower
of
London
,
with
its
axe
,
and
block
,
and
murder
out
of
number
.
 
<EOS>
so
delightful
be
an
act
of
true
humanity
,
and
so
glad
be
mankind
to
remember
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
home
,
intelligence
of
plot
begin
to
thicken
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
people
never
do
live
under
such
continual
terror
as
those
by
which
they
be
possess
now
,
of
catholic
rising
,
and
burning
,
and
poisoning
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
we
must
always
remember
that
they
live
near
and
close
to
awful
reality
of
that
kind
,
and
that
with
their
experience
it
be
not
difficult
to
believe
in
any
enormity
.
 
<EOS>
the
government
have
the
same
fear
,
and
do
not
take
the
good
mean
of
discover
the
truth
---
for
,
besides
torture
the
suspect
,
it
employ
pay
spy
,
who
will
always
lie
for
their
own
profit
.
 
<EOS>
It
even
make
some
of
the
conspiracy
it
bring
to
light
,
by
send
false
letter
to
disaffected
people
,
invite
them
to
join
in
pretended
plot
,
which
they
too
readily
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
one
great
real
plot
be
at
length
discover
,
and
it
end
the
career
of
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
.
 
<EOS>
a
seminary
priest
name
BALLARD
,
and
a
spanish
soldier
name
SAVAGE
,
set
on
and
encourage
by
certain
french
priest
,
impart
a
design
to
one
ANTONY
BABINGTON
---
a
gentleman
of
fortune
in
Derbyshire
,
who
have
be
for
some
time
a
secret
agent
of
Mary
's
---
for
murder
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Babington
then
confide
the
scheme
to
some
other
catholic
gentleman
who
be
his
friend
,
and
they
join
in
it
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
vain
,
weak
-
head
young
man
,
ridiculously
confident
,
and
preposterously
proud
of
their
plan
;
for
they
get
a
gimcrack
painting
make
,
of
the
six
choice
spirit
who
be
to
murder
Elizabeth
,
with
Babington
in
an
attitude
for
the
centre
figure
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
their
number
,
however
,
one
of
whom
be
a
priest
,
keep
Elizabeth
's
wisest
minister
,
SIR
FRANCIS
WALSINGHAM
,
acquaint
with
the
whole
project
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
the
conspirator
be
completely
deceive
to
the
final
point
,
when
Babington
give
Savage
,
because
he
be
shabby
,
a
ring
from
his
finger
,
and
some
money
from
his
purse
,
wherewith
to
buy
himself
new
clothe
in
which
to
kill
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Walsingham
,
have
then
full
evidence
against
the
whole
band
,
and
two
letter
of
Mary
's
besides
,
resolve
to
seize
them
.
 
<EOS>
suspect
something
wrong
,
they
steal
out
of
the
city
,
one
by
one
,
and
hide
themselves
in
St
John
's
Wood
,
and
other
place
which
really
be
hide
place
then
;
but
they
be
all
take
,
and
all
execute
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
seize
,
a
gentleman
be
send
from
Court
to
inform
Mary
of
the
fact
,
and
of
her
be
involve
in
the
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
Her
friend
have
complain
that
she
be
keep
in
very
hard
and
severe
custody
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
very
likely
,
for
she
be
go
out
a
hunting
that
very
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Queen
Elizabeth
have
be
warn
long
ago
,
by
one
in
France
who
have
good
information
of
what
be
secretly
do
,
that
in
hold
Mary
alive
,
she
hold
"
the
wolf
who
would
devour
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
London
have
,
more
lately
,
give
the
Queen
's
favourite
minister
the
advice
in
writing
,
"
forthwith
to
cut
off
the
Scottish
Queen
's
head
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
question
now
be
,
what
to
do
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Leicester
write
a
little
note
home
from
Holland
,
recommend
that
she
should
be
quietly
poison
;
that
noble
favourite
have
accustom
his
mind
,
it
be
possible
,
to
remedy
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
His
black
advice
,
however
,
be
disregard
,
and
she
be
bring
to
trial
at
Fotheringay
Castle
in
Northamptonshire
,
before
a
tribunal
of
forty
,
compose
of
both
religion
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
and
in
the
Star
Chamber
at
Westminster
,
the
trial
last
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
She
defend
herself
with
great
ability
,
but
could
only
deny
the
confession
that
have
be
make
by
Babington
and
other
;
could
only
call
her
own
letter
,
produce
against
her
by
her
own
secretary
,
forgery
;
and
,
in
short
,
could
only
deny
everything
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
find
guilty
,
and
declare
to
have
incur
the
penalty
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
meet
,
approve
the
sentence
,
and
pray
the
Queen
to
have
it
execute
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
reply
that
she
request
them
to
consider
whether
no
mean
could
be
find
of
save
Mary
's
life
without
endanger
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
rejoin
,
no
;
and
the
citizen
illuminate
their
house
and
light
bonfire
,
in
token
of
their
joy
that
all
these
plot
and
trouble
be
to
be
end
by
the
death
of
the
Queen
of
Scots
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
feel
sure
that
her
time
be
now
come
,
write
a
letter
to
the
Queen
of
England
,
make
three
entreaty
;
first
,
that
she
may
be
bury
in
France
;
secondly
,
that
she
may
not
be
execute
in
secret
,
but
before
her
servant
and
some
other
;
thirdly
,
that
after
her
death
,
her
servant
should
not
be
molest
,
but
should
be
suffer
to
go
home
with
the
legacy
she
leave
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
affect
letter
,
and
Elizabeth
shed
tear
over
it
,
but
send
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
a
special
ambassador
from
France
,
and
another
from
Scotland
,
to
intercede
for
Mary
's
life
;
and
then
the
nation
begin
to
clamour
,
more
and
more
,
for
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
what
the
real
feeling
or
intention
of
Elizabeth
be
,
can
never
be
know
now
;
but
I
strongly
suspect
her
of
only
wish
one
thing
more
than
Mary
's
death
,
and
that
be
to
keep
free
of
the
blame
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
first
of
February
,
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
eighty
-
seven
,
Lord
Burleigh
have
draw
out
the
warrant
for
the
execution
,
the
Queen
send
to
the
secretary
DAVISON
to
bring
it
to
her
,
that
she
may
sign
it
:
 
which
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
when
Davison
tell
her
it
be
seal
,
she
angrily
ask
him
why
such
haste
be
necessary
?
 
<EOS>
next
day
but
one
,
she
joke
about
it
,
and
swear
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
next
day
but
one
,
she
seem
to
complain
that
it
be
not
yet
do
,
but
still
she
would
not
be
plain
with
those
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
on
the
seventh
,
the
Earls
of
Kent
and
Shrewsbury
,
with
the
Sheriff
of
Northamptonshire
,
come
with
the
warrant
to
Fotheringay
,
to
tell
the
queen
of
Scots
to
prepare
for
death
.
  
<EOS>
when
those
messenger
of
ill
oman
be
go
,
Mary
make
a
frugal
supper
,
drink
to
her
servant
,
read
over
her
will
,
go
to
bed
,
sleep
for
some
hour
,
and
then
arise
and
pass
the
remainder
of
the
night
say
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
she
dress
herself
in
her
good
clothe
;
and
,
at
eight
o'clock
when
the
sheriff
come
for
her
to
her
chapel
,
take
leave
of
her
servant
who
be
there
assemble
pray
with
her
,
and
go
down
-
stair
,
carry
a
Bible
in
one
hand
and
a
crucifix
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
her
woman
and
four
of
her
man
be
allow
to
be
present
in
the
hall
;
where
a
low
scaffold
,
only
two
foot
from
the
ground
,
be
erect
and
cover
with
black
;
and
where
the
executioner
from
the
Tower
,
and
his
assistant
,
stand
,
dress
in
black
velvet
.
 
<EOS>
the
hall
be
full
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
sentence
be
be
read
she
sit
upon
a
stool
;
and
,
when
it
be
finish
,
she
again
deny
her
guilt
,
as
she
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Kent
and
the
Dean
of
Peterborough
,
in
their
Protestant
zeal
,
make
some
very
unnecessary
speech
to
her
;
to
which
she
reply
that
she
die
in
the
catholic
religion
,
and
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
about
that
matter
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
head
and
neck
be
uncover
by
the
executioner
,
she
say
that
she
have
not
be
use
to
be
undress
by
such
hand
,
or
before
so
much
company
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
one
of
her
woman
fasten
a
cloth
over
her
face
,
and
she
lay
her
neck
upon
the
block
,
and
repeat
more
than
once
in
Latin
,
"
into
thy
hand
,
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
I
commend
my
spirit
!
"
 
<EOS>
some
say
her
head
be
strike
off
in
two
blow
,
some
say
in
three
.
 
<EOS>
however
that
be
,
when
it
be
hold
up
,
stream
with
blood
,
the
real
hair
beneath
the
false
hair
she
have
long
wear
be
see
to
be
as
grey
as
that
of
a
woman
of
seventy
,
though
she
be
at
that
time
only
in
her
forty
-
sixth
year
.
 
<EOS>
all
her
beauty
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
beautiful
enough
to
her
little
dog
,
who
cower
under
her
dress
,
frighten
,
when
she
go
upon
the
scaffold
,
and
who
lie
down
beside
her
headless
body
when
all
her
earthly
sorrow
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
Third
Part
    
on
its
being
formally
make
known
to
Elizabeth
that
the
sentence
have
be
execute
on
the
Queen
of
Scots
,
she
show
the
utmost
grief
and
rage
,
drive
her
favourite
from
her
with
violent
indignation
,
and
send
Davison
to
the
Tower
;
from
which
place
he
be
only
release
in
the
end
by
pay
an
immense
fine
which
completely
ruin
him
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
not
only
over
-
act
her
part
in
make
these
pretence
,
but
most
basely
reduce
to
poverty
one
of
her
faithful
servant
for
no
other
fault
than
obey
her
command
.
  
<EOS>
James
,
King
of
Scotland
,
Mary
's
son
,
make
a
show
likewise
of
be
very
angry
on
the
occasion
;
but
he
be
a
pensioner
of
England
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
pound
a
year
,
and
he
have
know
very
little
of
his
mother
,
and
he
possibly
regard
her
as
the
murderer
of
his
father
,
and
he
soon
take
it
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
King
of
Spain
,
however
,
threaten
to
do
great
thing
than
ever
have
be
do
yet
,
to
set
up
the
catholic
religion
and
punish
Protestant
England
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
hear
that
he
and
the
Prince
of
Parma
be
make
great
preparation
for
this
purpose
,
in
order
to
be
beforehand
with
them
send
out
admiral
DRAKE
(
a
famous
navigator
,
who
have
sail
about
the
world
,
and
have
already
bring
great
plunder
from
Spain
)
to
the
port
of
Cadiz
,
where
he
burn
a
hundred
vessel
full
of
store
.
 
<EOS>
this
great
loss
oblige
the
Spaniards
to
put
off
the
invasion
for
a
year
;
but
it
be
none
the
less
formidable
for
that
,
amount
to
one
hundred
and
thirty
ship
,
nineteen
thousand
soldier
,
eight
thousand
sailor
,
two
thousand
slave
,
and
between
two
and
three
thousand
great
gun
.
<EOS>
England
be
not
idle
in
make
ready
to
resist
this
great
force
.
<EOS>
all
the
man
between
sixteen
year
old
and
sixty
,
be
train
and
drill
;
the
national
fleet
of
ship
<EOS>
(
in
number
only
thirty
-
four
at
first
)
be
enlarge
by
public
contribution
and
by
private
ship
,
fit
out
by
nobleman
;
the
city
of
London
,
of
its
own
accord
,
furnish
double
the
number
of
ship
and
man
that
it
be
require
to
provide
;
and
,
if
ever
the
national
spirit
be
up
in
England
,
it
be
up
all
through
the
country
to
resist
the
Spaniards
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
Queen
's
adviser
be
for
seize
the
principal
English
Catholics
,
and
put
them
to
death
;
but
the
Queen
---
who
,
to
her
honour
,
use
to
say
,
that
she
would
never
believe
any
ill
of
her
subject
,
which
a
parent
would
not
believe
of
her
own
child
---
reject
the
advice
,
and
only
confine
a
few
of
those
who
be
the
most
suspect
,
in
the
fen
in
Lincolnshire
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
body
of
Catholics
deserve
this
confidence
;
for
they
behave
most
loyally
,
nobly
,
and
bravely
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
with
all
England
fire
up
like
one
strong
,
angry
man
,
and
with
both
side
of
the
Thames
fortify
,
and
with
the
soldier
under
arm
,
and
with
the
sailor
in
their
ship
,
the
country
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
proud
spanish
fleet
,
which
be
call
the
INVINCIBLE
ARMADA
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
herself
,
ride
in
armour
on
a
white
horse
,
and
the
Earl
of
Essex
and
the
Earl
of
Leicester
hold
her
bridal
rein
,
make
a
brave
speech
to
the
troop
at
Tilbury
Fort
opposite
Gravesend
,
which
be
receive
with
such
enthusiasm
as
be
seldom
know
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
Spanish
Armada
into
the
English
Channel
,
sailing
along
in
the
form
of
a
half
moon
,
of
such
great
size
that
it
be
seven
mile
broad
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
English
be
quickly
upon
it
,
and
woe
then
to
all
the
spanish
ship
that
drop
a
little
out
of
the
half
moon
,
for
the
English
take
them
instantly
!
<EOS>
and
it
soon
appear
that
the
great
Armada
be
anything
but
invincible
,
for
on
a
summer
night
,
bold
Drake
send
eight
blaze
fire
-
ship
right
into
the
midst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
terrible
consternation
the
Spaniards
try
to
get
out
to
sea
,
and
so
become
disperse
;
the
English
pursue
them
at
a
great
advantage
;
a
storm
come
on
,
and
drive
the
Spaniards
among
rock
and
shoal
;
and
the
swift
end
of
the
invincible
fleet
be
,
that
it
lose
thirty
great
ship
and
ten
thousand
man
,
and
,
defeat
and
disgrace
,
sail
home
again
.
<EOS>
be
afraid
to
go
by
the
English
Channel
,
it
sail
all
round
Scotland
and
Ireland
;
some
of
the
ship
get
cast
away
on
the
latter
coast
in
bad
weather
,
the
Irish
,
who
be
a
kind
of
savage
,
plunder
those
vessel
and
kill
their
crew
.
 
<EOS>
so
end
this
great
attempt
to
invade
and
conquer
England
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
any
other
invincible
fleet
come
to
England
with
the
same
object
,
will
fare
much
better
than
the
Spanish
Armada
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
spanish
king
have
have
this
bitter
taste
of
english
bravery
,
he
be
so
little
the
wise
for
it
,
as
still
to
entertain
his
old
design
,
and
even
to
conceive
the
absurd
idea
of
place
his
daughter
on
the
english
throne
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
SIR
WALTER
RALEIGH
,
SIR
THOMAS
HOWARD
,
and
some
other
distinguished
leader
,
put
to
sea
from
Plymouth
,
enter
the
port
of
Cadiz
once
more
,
obtain
a
complete
victory
over
the
shipping
assemble
there
,
and
get
possession
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
the
Queen
's
express
instruction
,
they
behave
with
great
humanity
;
and
the
principal
loss
of
the
Spaniards
be
a
vast
sum
of
money
which
they
have
to
pay
for
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
many
gallant
achievement
on
the
sea
,
effect
in
this
reign
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
himself
,
after
marry
a
maid
of
honour
and
give
offence
to
the
Maiden
Queen
thereby
,
have
already
sail
to
South
America
in
search
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Leicester
be
now
dead
,
and
so
be
Sir
Thomas
Walsingham
,
whom
Lord
Burleigh
be
soon
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
the
principal
favourite
be
the
EARL
of
ESSEX
,
a
spirited
and
handsome
man
,
a
favourite
with
the
people
too
as
well
as
with
the
Queen
,
and
possess
of
many
admirable
quality
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
much
debate
at
court
whether
there
should
be
peace
with
Spain
or
no
,
and
he
be
very
urgent
for
war
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
try
hard
to
have
his
own
way
in
the
appointment
of
a
deputy
to
govern
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
this
question
be
in
dispute
,
he
hastily
take
offence
,
and
turn
his
back
upon
the
Queen
;
as
a
gentle
reminder
of
which
impropriety
,
the
Queen
give
him
a
tremendous
box
on
the
ear
,
and
tell
him
to
go
to
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
home
instead
,
and
do
not
reappear
at
Court
for
half
a
year
or
so
,
when
he
and
the
Queen
be
reconcile
,
though
never
(
as
some
suppose
)
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
time
the
fate
of
the
Earl
of
Essex
and
that
of
the
Queen
seem
to
be
blend
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
Irish
be
still
perpetually
quarrel
and
fight
among
themselves
,
and
he
go
over
to
Ireland
as
Lord
Lieutenant
,
to
the
great
joy
of
his
enemy
<EOS>
(
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
among
the
rest
)
,
who
be
glad
to
have
so
dangerous
a
rival
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
not
be
by
any
mean
successful
there
,
and
know
that
his
enemy
would
take
advantage
of
that
circumstance
to
injure
him
with
the
Queen
,
he
come
home
again
,
though
against
her
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
take
by
surprise
when
he
appear
before
her
,
give
him
her
hand
to
kiss
,
and
he
be
overjoy
---
though
it
be
not
a
very
lovely
hand
by
this
time
---
<EOS>
but
in
the
course
of
the
same
day
she
order
him
to
confine
himself
to
his
room
,
and
two
or
three
day
afterwards
have
him
take
into
custody
.
<EOS>
with
the
same
sort
of
caprice
---
and
as
capricious
an
old
woman
she
now
be
,
as
ever
wear
a
crown
or
a
head
either
---
she
send
him
broth
from
her
own
table
on
his
fall
ill
from
anxiety
,
and
cry
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
could
find
comfort
and
occupation
in
his
book
,
and
he
do
so
for
a
time
;
not
the
least
happy
time
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
happen
unfortunately
for
him
,
that
he
hold
a
monopoly
in
sweet
wine
:
 
which
mean
that
nobody
could
sell
them
without
purchase
his
permission
.
 
<EOS>
this
right
,
which
be
only
for
a
term
<EOS>
,
expire
,
he
apply
to
have
it
renew
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
refuse
,
with
the
rather
strong
observation
---
but
she
do
make
strong
observation
---
that
an
unruly
beast
must
be
stint
in
his
food
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
angry
Earl
,
who
have
be
already
deprive
of
many
office
,
think
himself
in
danger
of
complete
ruin
,
and
turn
against
the
Queen
,
whom
he
call
a
vain
old
woman
who
have
grow
as
crooked
in
her
mind
as
she
have
in
her
figure
.
 
<EOS>
these
uncomplimentary
expression
the
lady
of
the
Court
immediately
snap
up
and
carry
to
the
Queen
,
whom
they
do
not
put
in
a
well
tempter
,
you
may
believe
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
Court
lady
,
when
they
have
beautiful
dark
hair
of
their
own
,
use
to
wear
false
red
hair
,
to
be
like
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
be
not
very
high
-
spirited
lady
,
however
high
in
rank
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
object
of
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
and
some
friend
of
his
who
use
to
meet
at
LORD
SOUTHAMPTON
's
house
,
be
to
obtain
possession
of
the
Queen
,
and
oblige
her
by
force
to
dismiss
her
minister
and
change
her
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
on
Saturday
the
seventh
of
February
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
one
,
the
council
suspect
this
,
summon
the
Earl
to
come
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
pretend
to
be
ill
,
decline
;
it
be
then
settle
among
his
friend
,
that
as
the
next
day
would
be
Sunday
,
when
many
of
the
citizen
usually
assemble
at
the
Cross
by
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
he
should
make
one
bold
effort
to
induce
them
to
rise
and
follow
him
to
the
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
he
and
a
small
body
of
adherent
start
out
of
his
house
---
<EOS>
Essex
House
by
the
Strand
,
with
step
to
the
river
---
<EOS>
have
first
shut
up
in
it
,
as
prisoner
,
some
member
of
the
council
who
come
to
examine
him
---
and
hurry
into
the
City
with
the
Earl
at
their
head
cry
out
"
for
the
Queen
!
 
<EOS>
for
the
Queen
!
 
<EOS>
a
plot
be
lay
for
my
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
no
one
heed
them
,
however
,
and
when
they
come
to
St
Paul
's
there
be
no
citizen
there
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
prisoner
at
Essex
House
have
be
release
by
one
of
the
Earl
's
own
friend
;
he
have
be
promptly
proclaim
a
traitor
in
the
City
itself
;
and
the
street
be
barricade
with
cart
and
guard
by
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
get
back
to
his
house
by
water
,
with
difficulty
,
and
after
an
attempt
to
defend
his
house
against
the
troop
and
cannon
by
which
it
be
soon
surround
,
give
himself
up
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bring
to
trial
on
the
nineteenth
,
and
find
guilty
;
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
,
he
be
execute
on
Tower
Hill
,
where
he
die
,
at
thirty
-
four
year
old
,
both
courageously
and
penitently
.
 
<EOS>
His
step
-
father
suffer
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
enemy
,
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,
stand
near
the
scaffold
all
the
time
---
but
not
so
near
it
as
we
shall
see
him
stand
,
before
we
finish
his
history
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
and
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
,
the
Queen
have
command
,
and
countermand
,
and
again
command
,
the
execution
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
the
death
of
her
young
and
gallant
favourite
in
the
prime
of
his
good
quality
,
be
never
off
her
mind
afterwards
,
but
she
hold
out
,
the
same
vain
,
obstinate
and
capricious
woman
,
for
another
year
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
dance
before
her
Court
on
a
state
occasion
---
and
cut
,
I
should
think
,
a
mighty
ridiculous
figure
,
do
so
in
an
immense
ruff
,
stomacher
and
wig
,
at
seventy
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
for
another
year
still
,
she
hold
out
,
but
,
without
any
more
dancing
,
and
as
a
moody
,
sorrowful
,
broken
creature
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
on
the
tenth
of
March
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
three
,
have
be
ill
of
a
very
bad
cold
,
and
make
bad
by
the
death
of
the
Countess
of
Nottingham
who
be
her
intimate
friend
,
she
fall
into
a
stupor
and
be
suppose
to
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
She
recover
her
consciousness
,
however
,
and
then
nothing
would
induce
her
to
go
to
bed
;
for
she
say
that
she
know
that
if
she
do
,
she
should
never
get
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
she
lie
for
ten
day
,
on
cushion
on
the
floor
,
without
any
food
,
until
the
Lord
Admiral
get
her
into
bed
at
last
,
partly
by
persuasion
and
partly
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
ask
her
who
should
succeed
her
,
she
reply
that
her
seat
have
be
the
seat
of
king
,
and
that
she
would
have
for
her
successor
,
"
no
rascal
's
son
,
but
a
King
's
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
,
the
lord
present
stare
at
one
another
,
and
take
the
liberty
of
ask
whom
she
mean
;
to
which
she
reply
,
"
whom
should
I
mean
,
but
our
cousin
of
Scotland
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
on
the
twenty
-
third
of
March
.
 
<EOS>
They
ask
her
once
again
that
day
,
after
she
be
speechless
,
whether
she
be
still
in
the
same
mind
?
 
<EOS>
She
struggle
up
in
bed
,
and
join
her
hand
over
her
head
in
the
form
of
a
crown
,
as
the
only
reply
she
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
at
three
o'clock
next
morning
,
she
very
quietly
die
,
in
the
forty
-
fifth
year
of
her
reign
.
  
<EOS>
that
reign
have
be
a
glorious
one
,
and
be
make
for
ever
memorable
by
the
distinguished
man
who
flourish
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
apart
from
the
great
voyager
,
statesman
,
and
scholar
,
whom
it
produce
,
the
name
of
BACON
,
SPENSER
,
and
SHAKESPEARE
,
will
always
be
remember
with
pride
and
veneration
by
the
civilised
world
,
and
will
always
impart
(
though
with
no
great
reason
,
perhaps
)
some
portion
of
their
lustre
to
the
name
of
Elizabeth
herself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
reign
for
discovery
,
for
commerce
,
and
for
english
enterprise
and
spirit
in
general
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
reign
for
the
protestant
religion
and
for
the
Reformation
which
make
England
free
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
very
popular
,
and
in
her
progress
,
or
journey
about
her
dominion
,
be
everywhere
receive
with
the
lively
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
truth
be
,
that
she
be
not
half
so
good
as
she
have
be
make
out
,
and
not
half
so
bad
as
she
have
be
make
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
her
fine
quality
,
but
she
be
coarse
,
capricious
,
and
treacherous
,
and
have
all
the
fault
of
an
excessively
vain
young
woman
long
after
she
be
an
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
she
have
a
great
deal
too
much
of
her
father
in
her
,
to
please
me
.
  
<EOS>
many
improvement
and
luxury
be
introduce
in
the
course
of
these
five
-
and
-
forty
year
in
the
general
manner
of
living
;
but
cock
-
fighting
,
bull
-
baiting
,
and
bear
-
baiting
,
be
still
the
national
amusement
;
and
a
coach
be
so
rarely
see
,
and
be
such
an

<EOS>
His
tongue
be
much
too
large
for
his

,
his

be
much
too
weak
for
his
body
,
and
his
dull
goggle

eye
stare
and
roll
like

<EOS>
He
be
cunning
,
covetous
,
wasteful
,
idle
,
drunken
,
greedy
,
dirty
,
cowardly
,
a
great
swearer

the

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
what
be
commonly
call
rickety
from
his

---
present
a
most
ridiculous
appearance
,
dress
in
thick
padded
clothe

as
a
safeguard
against
be

of
which
he
live

his

He

loll
on
the

of
his
favourite
courtier
,
and
slobber
their
face
,
and
kiss

himself
in

to
his
royal

,
His
Majesty

"
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
be
the
bad
rider
ever
see
,
and
think
himself
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
most
impertinent
talker
(
in
the
broad
Scotch
)
ever
hear
,
and
boast
of
be
unanswerable
in
all
manner
of
argument
.
 
<EOS>
He
write
some
of
the
most
wearisome
treatise
ever
read
---
among
other
,
a
book
upon
witchcraft
,
in
which
he
be
a
devout
believer
---
and
think
himself
a
prodigy
of
authorship
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
,
and
write
,
and
say
,
that
a
king
have
a
right
to
make
and
unmake
what
law
he
please
,
and
ought
to
be
accountable
to
nobody
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
plain
,
true
character
of
the
personage
whom
the
great
man
about
the
court
praise
and
flatter
to
that
degree
,
that
I
doubt
if
there
be
anything
much
more
shameful
in
the
annal
of
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
english
throne
with
great
ease
.
 
<EOS>
the
misery
of
a
dispute
succession
have
be
feel
so
long
,
and
so
dreadfully
,
that
he
be
proclaim
within
a

hour
of
Elizabeth

death
,
and
be
accept
by
the
nation
,
even
without
be
ask
to
give
any
pledge
that
he
would
govern
well
,
or
that
he
would
redress
cry
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
a
month
to
come
from
Edinburgh
to
London
;
and
,
by
way
of
exercise
his
new
power
,
hang
a
pickpocket
on
the
journey
without
any
trial
,
and
knight
everybody
he
could
lay
hold
of

<EOS>
He
make
two
hundred
knight
before
he
get
to
his
palace
in
London
,
and
seven
hundred
before
he

<EOS>
He
also
shovel
sixty

two
new

the
House
of
Lords
---
and
there
be
a
pretty
large
sprinkling
of
Scotchmen
among
them
,
you
may
believe
.
  
<EOS>
His
Sowship
's
prime
Minister
,
CECIL
(
for
I
can
not
do
well
than
call
his
majesty
<EOS>
what
his
favourite
call
him
)
,
be
the
enemy
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,
and
also
of
Sir
Walter
's
political
friend
,
LORD
COBHAM
;
and
his
Sowship
's
first
trouble
be
a
plot
originate
by
these
two
,
and
enter
into
by
some
other
,
with
the
old
object
of
seize
the
King
and
keep
him
in
imprisonment
until
he
should
change
his
minister
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
catholic
priest
in
the
plot
,
and
there
be
Puritan
nobleman
too
;
for
,
although
the
Catholics
and
Puritans
be
strongly
opposed
to
each
other
,
they
unite
at
this
time
against
his
sowship
,
because
they
know
that
he
have
a
design
against
both
,
after
pretend
to
be
friendly
to
each
;
this
design
be
to
have
only
one
high
and
convenient
form
of
the
protestant
religion
,
which
everybody
should
be
bind
to
belong
to
,
whether
they
like
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
this
plot
be
mix
up
with
another
,
which
may
or
may
not
have
have
some
reference
to
place
on
the
throne
,
at
some
time
,
the
LADY
ARABELLA
STUART
;
whose
misfortune
it
be
,
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
young
brother
of
his
Sowship
's
father
,
but
who
be
quite
innocent
of
any
part
in
the
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
be
accuse
on
the
confession
of
Lord
Cobham
---
a
miserable
creature
,
who
say
one
thing
at
one
time
,
and
another
thing
at
another
time
,
and
could
be
rely
upon
in
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
trial
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
last
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
nearly
midnight
;
he
defend
himself
with
such
eloquence
,
genius
,
and
spirit
against
all
accusation
,
and
against
the
insult
of
COKE
,
the
Attorney
-
General
---
who
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
time
,
foully
abuse
him
---
that
those
who
go
there
detest
the
prisoner
,
come
away
admire
him
,
and
declare
that
anything
so
wonderful
and
so
captivate
be
never
hear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
find
guilty
,
nevertheless
,
and
sentence
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
execution
be
defer
,
and
he
be
take
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
catholic
priest
,
less
fortunate
,
be
execute
with
the
usual
atrocity
;
and
Lord
Cobham
and
two
other
be
pardon
on
the
scaffold
.
 
<EOS>
His
Sowship
think
it
wonderfully
know
in
him
to
surprise
the
people
by
pardon
these
three
at
the
very
block
;
but
,
blunder
,
and
bungle
,
as
usual
,
he
have
very
nearly
overreach
himself
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
the
messenger
on
horseback
who
bring
the
pardon
,
come
so
late
,
that
he
be
push
to
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
and
be
oblige
to
shout
and
roar
out
what
he
come
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
miserable
Cobham
do
not
gain
much
by
be
spare
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
,
both
as
a
prisoner
and
a
beggar
,
utterly
despised
,
and
miserably
poor
,
for
thirteen
year
,
and
then
die
in
an
old
outhouse
belong
to
one
of
his
former
servant
.
  
<EOS>
this
plot
get
rid
of
,
and
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
safely
shut
up
in
the
Tower
,
his
sowship
hold
a
great
dispute
with
the
Puritans
on
their
present
a
petition
to
him
,
and
have
it
all
his
own
way
---
not
so
very
wonderful
,
as
he
would
talk
continually
,
and
would
not
hear
anybody
else
---
and
fill
the
Bishops
with
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
comfortably
settle
that
there
be
to
be
only
one
form
of
religion
,
and
that
all
man
be
to
think
exactly
alike
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
although
this
be
arrange
two
century
and
a
half
ago
,
and
although
the
arrangement
be
support
by
much
fining
and
imprisonment
,
I
do
not
find
that
it
be
quite
successful
,
even
yet
.
  
<EOS>
His
sowship
,
have
that
uncommonly
high
opinion
of
himself
as
a
king
,
have
a
very
low
opinion
of
Parliament
as
a
power
that
audaciously
want
to
control
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
call
his
first
Parliament
after
he
have
be
king
a
year
,
he
accordingly
think
he
would
take
pretty
high
ground
with
them
,
and
tell
them
that
he
command
them
"
as
an
absolute
king
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
think
those
strong
word
,
and
see
the
necessity
of
uphold
their
authority
.
<EOS>
His
sowship
have
three
child
:
 
Prince
Henry
,
Prince
Charles
,
and
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
for
one
of
these
,
and
we
shall
too
soon
see
which
,
if
he
have
learn
a
little
wisdom
concern
parliament
from
his
father
's
obstinacy
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
people
still
labour
under
their
old
dread
of
the
catholic
religion
,
this
Parliament
revive
and
strengthen
the
severe
law
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
so
angered
ROBERT
CATESBY
,
a
restless
catholic
gentleman
of
an
old
family
,
that
he
form
one
of
the
most
desperate
and
terrible
design
ever
conceive
in
the
mind
of
man
;
no
less
a
scheme
than
the
Gunpowder
Plot
.
  
<EOS>
His
object
be
,
when
the
King
,
lord
,
and
common
,
should
be
assemble
at
the
next
opening
of
Parliament
,
to
blow
them
up
,
one
and
all
,
with
a
great
mine
of
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
person
to
whom
he
confide
this
horrible
idea
be
THOMAS
WINTER
,
a
Worcestershire
gentleman
who
have
serve
in
the
army
abroad
,
and
have
be
secretly
employ
in
catholic
project
.
 
<EOS>
while
Winter
be
yet
undecided
,
and
when
he
have
go
over
to
the
Netherlands
,
to
learn
from
the
spanish
Ambassador
there
whether
there
be
any
hope
of
Catholics
be
relieve
through
the
intercession
of
the
King
of
Spain
with
his
sowship
,
he
find
at
Ostend
a
tall
,
dark
,
daring
man
,
whom
he
have
know
when
they
be
both
soldier
abroad
,
and
whose
name
be
GUIDO
---
or
GUY
---
FAWKES
.
 
<EOS>
resolve
to
join
the
plot
,
he
propose
it
to
this
man
,
know
him
to
be
the
man
for
any
desperate
deed
,
and
they
two
come
back
to
England
together
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
they
admit
two
other
conspirator
;
THOMAS
PERCY
,
relate
to
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
and
JOHN
WRIGHT
,
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
meet
together
in
a
solitary
house
in
the
open
field
which
be
then
near
Clement
's
Inn
,
now
a
closely
block
-
up
part
of
London
;
and
when
they
have
all
take
a
great
oath
of
secrecy
,
Catesby
tell
the
rest
what
his
plan
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
go
up
-
stair
into
a
garret
,
and
receive
the
Sacrament
from
FATHER
GERARD
,
a
Jesuit
,
who
be
say
not
to
have
know
actually
of
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
but
who
,
I
think
,
must
have
have
his
suspicion
that
there
be
something
desperate
afoot
.
  
<EOS>
Percy
be
a
Gentleman
Pensioner
,
and
as
he
have
occasional
duty
to
perform
about
the
Court
,
then
keep
at
Whitehall
,
there
would
be
nothing
suspicious
in
his
living
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
have
look
well
about
him
,
and
have
find
a
house
to
let
,
the
back
of
which
join
the
Parliament
House
,
he
hire
it
of
a
person
name
FERRIS
,
for
the
purpose
of
undermine
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
have
get
possession
of
this
house
,
the
conspirator
hire
another
on
the
Lambeth
side
of
the
Thames
,
which
they
use
as
a
storehouse
for
wood
,
gunpowder
,
and
other
combustible
matter
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
to
be
remove
at
night
(
and
afterwards
be
remove
)
,
bit
by
bit
,
to
the
house
at
Westminster
;
and
,
that
there
may
be
some
trusty
person
to
keep
watch
over
the
Lambeth
store
,
they
admit
another
conspirator
,
by
name
ROBERT
KAY
,
a
very
poor
catholic
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
arrangement
have
be
make
some
month
,
and
it
be
a
dark
,
wintry
,
December
night
,
when
the
conspirator
,
who
have
be
in
the
meantime
disperse
to
avoid
observation
,
meet
in
the
house
at
Westminster
,
and
begin
to
dig
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
lay
in
a
good
stock
of
eatable
,
to
avoid
go
in
and
out
,
and
they
dig
and
dig
with
great
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
wall
be
tremendously
thick
,
and
the
work
very
severe
,
they
take
into
their
plot
CHRISTOPHER
WRIGHT
,
a
young
brother
of
John
Wright
,
that
they
may
have
a
new
pair
of
hand
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
and
Christopher
Wright
fall
to
like
a
fresh
man
,
and
they
dig
and
dig
by
night
and
by
day
,
and
Fawkes
stand
sentinel
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
any
man
's
heart
seem
to
fail
him
at
all
,
Fawkes
say
,
"
gentleman
,
we
have
abundance
of
powder
and
shoot
here
,
and
there
be
no
fear
of
our
be
take
alive
,
even
if
discover
.
"
<EOS>
the
same
fawke
,
who
,
in
the
capacity
of
sentinel
,
be
always
prowl
about
,
soon
pick
up
the
intelligence
that
the
King
have
prorogue
the
Parliament
again
,
from
the
seventh
of
February
,
the
day
first
fix
upon
,
until
the
third
of
October
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
conspirator
know
this
,
they
agree
to
separate
until
after
the
Christmas
holiday
,
and
to
take
no
notice
of
each
other
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
never
to
write
letter
to
one
another
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
house
in
Westminster
be
shut
up
again
,
and
I
suppose
the
neighbour
think
that
those
strange
-
look
man
who
live
there
so
gloomily
,
and
go
out
so
seldom
,
be
go
away
to
have
a
merry
Christmas
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
beginning
of
February
,
sixteen
hundred
and
five
,
when
Catesby
meet
his
fellow
-
conspirator
again
at
this
Westminster
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
now
admit
three
more
;
JOHN
GRANT
,
a
Warwickshire
gentleman
of
a
melancholy
temper
,
who
live
in
a
doleful
house
near
Stratford
-
upon
-
Avon
,
with
a
frown
wall
all
round
it
,
and
a
deep
moat
;
ROBERT
WINTER
,
eld
brother
of
Thomas
;
and
Catesby
's
own
servant
,
THOMAS
BATES
,
who
,
Catesby
think
,
have
have
some
suspicion
of
what
his
master
be
about
.
 
<EOS>
these
three
have
all
suffer
more
or
less
for
their
religion
in
Elizabeth
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
they
all
begin
to
dig
again
,
and
they
dig
and
dig
by
night
and
by
day
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
it
dismal
work
alone
there
,
underground
,
with
such
a
fearful
secret
on
their
mind
,
and
so
many
murder
before
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
fill
with
wild
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
they
think
they
hear
a
great
bell
tolling
,
deep
down
in
the
earth
under
the
Parliament
House
;
sometimes
,
they
think
they
hear
low
voice
mutter
about
the
Gunpowder
Plot
;
once
in
the
morning
,
they
really
do
hear
a
great
rumble
noise
over
their
head
,
as
they
dig
and
sweat
in
their
mine
.
 
<EOS>
every
man
stop
and
look
aghast
at
his
neighbour
,
wonder
what
have
happen
,
when
that
bold
prowler
,
Fawkes
,
who
have

thirty
barrel

and
cover

<EOS>
Most
of
these

and
be

assist
the

,
some
with
money
and
some
with
horse
on
which
the
conspirator
be
to
ride
through
the
country
and
rouse
the
Catholics
after
the
Parliament

<EOS>
Parliament
be
again
prorogue
from
the
third
of
October
to
the
fifth
of
November
,
and
the
conspirator
be
uneasy
lest
their
design
should
have
be
find
out
<EOS>
,
Thomas
Winter
say
he
would
go
up
into
the
House
of
Lords
on
the
day
of
the
prorogation
,
and
see
how
matter
look
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
unconscious
Commissioners
be
walk
about
and
talk
to
one
another
,
just
over
the
six
-
and
-
thirty
barrel
of
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
back
and
tell
the
rest
so
,
and
they
go
on
with
their
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
They
hire
a
ship
,
and
keep
it
ready
in
the
Thames
,
in
which
Fawkes
be
to
sail
for
flander
after
fire
with
a
slow
match
the
train
that

a

on
pretence

a
hunting
party
,
to
meet
Sir

Digby
at
Dunchurch
on
the
fatal
day
,
that
they
may
be
ready
to
act
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
all
be
ready
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
now
,
the
great
wickedness
and
danger
which
have
be
all
along
at
the
bottom
of
this
wicked
plot
,
begin
to
show
itself
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
fifth
of
November
draw
near
,
most
of
the
conspirator
,
remember
that
they
have
friend
and
relation
who
would
be
in
the
House
of
Lords
that
day
,
feel
some
natural
relenting
,
and
a
wish
to
warn
them
to
keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
much
comfort
by
Catesby
's
declare
that
in
such
a
cause
he
would
blow
up
his
own
son
.
 
<EOS>
LORD
MOUNTEAGLE
,
Tresham
's
brother
-
in
-
law
,
be
certain
to
be
in
the
house
;
and
when
Tresham
find
that
he
could
not
prevail
upon
the
rest
to
devise
any
mean
of
spare
their
friend
,
he
write
a
mysterious
letter
to
this
lord
and
leave
it
at
his
lodging
in
the
dusk
,
urge
him
to
keep
away
from
the
opening
of
Parliament
,
"
since
God
and
man
have
concur
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
contain
the
word
"
that
the
Parliament
should
receive
a
terrible
blow
,
and
yet
should
not
see
who
hurt
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
it
add
,
"
the
danger
be
past
,
as
soon
as
you
have
burn
the
letter
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
minister
and
courtier
make
out
that
his
sowship
,
by
a
direct
miracle
from
Heaven
,
find
out
what
this
letter
mean
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
they
be
not
long
(
as
few
man
would
be
)
in
find
out
for
themselves
;
and
it
be
decide
to
let
the
conspirator
alone
,
until
the
very
day
before
the
opening
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
conspirator
have
their
fear
,
be
certain
;
for
,
Tresham
himself
say
before
them
all
,
that
they
be
every
one
dead
man
;
and
,
although
even
he
do
not
take
flight
,
there
be
reason
to
suppose
that
he
have
warn
other
person
besides
Lord
Mounteagle
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
be
all
firm
;
and
Fawkes
,
who
be
a
man
of
iron
,
go
down
every
day
and
night
to
keep
watch
in
the
cellar
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
there
about
two
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
,
when
the
Lord
Chamberlain
and
Lord
Mounteagle
throw
open
the
door
and
look
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
,
friend
?
"
say
they
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Fawkes
,
"
I
be
Mr
Percy
's
servant
,
and
be
look
after
his
store
of
fuel
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
have
lay
in
a
pretty
good
store
,
"
they
return
,
and
shut
the
door
,
and
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
Fawkes
,
upon
this
,
post
off
to
the
other
conspirator
to
tell
them
all
be
quiet
,
and
go
back
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
dark
,
black
cellar
again
,
where
he
hear
the
bell
go
twelve
o'clock
and
usher
in
the
fifth
of
November
.
 
<EOS>
about
two
hour
afterwards
,
he
slowly
open
the
door
,
and
come
out
to
look
about
him
,
in
his
old
prowling
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
instantly
seize
and
bind
,
by
a
party
of
soldier
under
SIR
THOMAS
KNEVETT
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
watch
upon
him
,
some
touchwood
,
some
tinder
,
some
slow
match
;
and
there
be
a
dark
lantern
with
a
candle
in
it
,
light
,
behind
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
boot
and
spur
on
---
to
ride
to
the
ship
,
I
suppose
---
and
it
be
well
for
the
soldier
that
they
take
him
so
suddenly
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
leave
him
but
a
moment
's
time
to
light
a
match
,
he
certainly
would
have
toss
it
in
among
the
powder
,
and
blow
up
himself
and
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
take
him
to
the
King
's
bed
-
chamber
first
of
all
,
and
there
the
King
(
cause
him
to
be
hold
very
tight
,
and
keep
a
good
way
off
)
,
ask
him
how
he
could
have
the
heart
to
intend
to
destroy
so
many
innocent
people
?
 
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
desperate
disease
need
desperate
remedy
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
a
little
Scotch
favourite
,
with
a
face
like
a
terrier
,
who
ask
him
(
with
no
particular
wisdom
)
why
he
have
collect
so
much
gunpowder
,
he
reply
,
because
he
have
mean
to
blow
scotchman
back
to
Scotland
,
and
it
would
take
a
deal
of
powder
to
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
he
be
carry
to
the
Tower
,
but
would
make
no
confession
.
 
<EOS>
even
after
be
horribly
torture
,
he
confess
nothing
that
the
Government
do
not
already
know
;
though
he
must
have
be
in
a
fearful
state
---
as
his
signature
,
still
preserve
,
in
contrast
with
his
natural
hand
-
writing
before
he
be
put
upon
the
dreadful
rack
,
most
frightfully
show
.
 
<EOS>
Bates
,
a
very
different
man
,
soon
say
the
Jesuits
have
have
to
do
with
the
plot
,
and
probably
,
under
the
torture
,
would
as
readily
have
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Tresham
,
take
and
put
in
the
Tower
too
,
make
confession
and
unmade
them
,
and
die
of
an
illness
that
be
heavy
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Rookwood
,
who
have
station
relay
of
his
own
horse
all
the
way
to
Dunchurch
,
do
not
mount
to
escape
until
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
the
news
of
the
plot
be
all
over
London
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
road
,
he
come
up
with
the
two
Wrights
,
Catesby
,
and
Percy
;
and
they
all
gallop
together
into
Northamptonshire
.
 
<EOS>
thence
to
Dunchurch
,
where
they
find
the
propose
party
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
that
there
have
be
a
plot
,
and
that
it
have
be
discover
,
the
party
disappear
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
and
leave
them
alone
with
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
 
<EOS>
away
they
all
ride
again
,
through
Warwickshire
and
Worcestershire
,
to
a
house
call
Holbeach
,
on
the
border
of
Staffordshire
.
 
<EOS>
They
try
to
raise
the
Catholics
on
their
way
,
but
be
indignantly
drive
off
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
they
be
hotly
pursue
by
the
sheriff
of
Worcester
,
and
a
fast
increase
concourse
of
rider
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
resolve
to
defend
themselves
at
Holbeach
,
they
shut
themselves
up
in
the
house
,
and
put
some
wet
powder
before
the
fire
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
blow
up
,
and
Catesby
be
singe
and
blacken
,
and
almost
kill
,
and
some
of
the
other
be
sadly
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
know
that
they
must
die
,
they
resolve
to
die
there
,
and
with
only
their
sword
in
their
hand
appear
at
the
window
to
be
shoot
at
by
the
sheriff
and
his
assistant
.
 
<EOS>
Catesby
say
to
Thomas
Winter
,
after
Thomas
have
be
hit
in
the
right
arm
which
drop
powerless
by
his
side
,
"
stand
by
me
,
Tom
,
and
we
will
die
together
!
"
<EOS>
---
which
they
do
,
be
shoot
through
the
body
by
two
bullet
from
one
gun
.
 
<EOS>
John
Wright
,
and
Christopher
Wright
,
and
Percy

be
also
shoot

<EOS>
Rookwood
and
Digby
be
take
:
 
the
former
with
a
broken
arm
and
a
wound
in
his
body
too
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
fifteenth
of
January
,
before
the
trial
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
such
of
the
other
conspirator
as
be
leave
alive
,
come
on
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
find
guilty
,
all
hang
,
draw
,
and
quarter
:
<EOS>
some
,
in
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
on
the
top
of
Ludgate
-
hill
;
some
,
before
the
Parliament
House
.
 
<EOS>
a
Jesuit
priest
,
name
HENRY
GARNET
,
to
whom
the
dreadful
design
be
say
to
have
be
communicate
,
be
take
and
try
;
and
two
of
his
servant
,
as
well
as
a
poor
priest
who
be
take
with
him
,
be
torture
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
be
not
torture
,
but
be
surround
in
the
Tower
by
tamperer
and
traitor
,
and
so
be
make
unfairly
to
convict
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
upon
his
trial
,
that
he
have
do
all
he
could
to
prevent
the
deed
,
and
that
he
could
not
make
public
what
have
be
tell
him
in
confession
---
though
I
be
afraid
he
know
of
the
plot
in
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
find
guilty
and
execute
,
after
a
manful
defence
,
and
the
Catholic
Church
make
a
saint
of
him
;
some
rich
and
powerful
person
,
who
have
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
project
,
be
fine
and
imprison
for
it
by
the
Star
Chamber
;
the
Catholics
,
in
general
,
who
have
recoil
with
horror
from
the
idea
of
the
infernal
contrivance
,
be
unjustly
put
under
more
severe
law
than
before
;
and
this
be
the
end
of
the
Gunpowder
Plot
.
  
<EOS>
Second
part
    
<EOS>
His
sowship
would
pretty
willingly
,
I
think
,
have
blow
the
House
of
Commons
into
the
air
himself
;
for
,
his
dread
and
jealousy
of
it
know
no
bound
all
through
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
hard
press
for
money
he
be
oblige
to
order
it
to
meet
,
as
he
could
get
no
money
without
it
;
and
when
it
ask
him
first
to
abolish
some
of
the
monopoly
in
necessary
of
life
which
be
a
great
grievance
to
the
people
,
and
to
redress
other
public
wrong
,
he
fly
into
a
rage
and
get
rid
of
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
he
want
it
to
consent
to
the
Union
of
England
with
Scotland
,
and
quarrel
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
at
another
time
it
want
him
to
put
down
a
most
infamous
church
abuse
,
call
the
High
Commission
Court
,
and
he
quarrel
with
it
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
at
another
time
it
entreat
him
not
to
be
quite
so
fond
of
his
archbishop
and
bishop
who
make
speech
in
his
praise
too
awful
to
be
relate
,
but
to
have
some
little
consideration
for
the
poor
Puritan
clergy
who
be
persecute
for
preach
in
their
own
way
,
and
not
accord
to
the
archbishop
and
bishop
;
and
they
quarrel
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
what
with
hate
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
pretend
not
to
hate
it
;
and
what
with
now
send
some
of
its
member
who
oppose
him
,
to
Newgate
or
to
the
Tower
,
and
now
tell
the
rest
that
they
must
not
presume
to
make
speech
about
the
public
affair
which
could
not
possibly
concern
them
;
and
what
with
cajoling
,
and
bullying
,
and
fighting
,
and
be
frighten
;
the
House
of
Commons
be
the
plague
of
his
Sowship
's
existence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
firm
,
however
,
in
maintain
its
right
,
and
insist
that
the
Parliament
should
make
the
law
,
and
not
the
king
by
his
own
single
proclamation
(
which
he
try
hard
to
do
)
;
and
his
sowship
be
so
often
distressed
for
money
,
in
consequence
,
that
he
sell
every
sort
of
title
and
public
office
as
if
they
be
merchandise
,
and
even
invent
a
new
dignity
call
a
Baronetcy
,
which
anybody
could
buy
for
a
thousand
pound
.
  
<EOS>
these
dispute
with
his
parliament
,
and
his
hunting
,
and
his
drinking
,
and
his
lying
in
bed
---
for
he
be
a
great
sluggard
---
occupy
his
sowship
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
his
time
he
chiefly
pass
in
hugging
and
slobber
his
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
be
SIR
PHILIP
HERBERT
,
who
have
no
knowledge
<EOS>
whatever
,
except
of
dog
,
and
horse
,
and
hunting
,
but
whom
he
soon
make
EARL
of
MONTGOMERY
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
,
and
a
much
more
famous
one
,
be
ROBERT
CARR
,
or
KER
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
not
certain
which
be
his
right
name
)
,
who
come
from
the
Border
country
,
and
whom
he
soon
make
viscount
ROCHESTER
,
and
afterwards
,
EARL
of
SOMERSET
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
in
which
his
sowship
dote
on
this
handsome
young
man
,
be
even
more
odious
to
think
of
,
than
the
way
in
which
the
really
great
man
of
England
condescend
to
bow
down
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
favourite
's
great
friend
be
a
certain
SIR
thomas
OVERBURY
,
who
write
his
love
-
letter
for
him
,
and
assist
him
in
the
duty
of
his
many
high
place
,
which
his
own
ignorance
prevent
him
from
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
same
Sir
Thomas
have
just
manhood
enough
to
dissuade
the
favourite
from
a
wicked
marriage
with
the
beautiful
Countess
of
Essex
,
who
be
to
get
a
divorce
from
her
husband
for
the
purpose
,
<EOS>
the
say
Countess
,
in
her
rage
,
get
Sir
Thomas
put
into
the
Tower
,
and
there
poison
him
.
<EOS>
then
the
favourite
and
this
bad
woman
be
publicly
marry
by
the
King
's
pet
bishop
,
with
as
much
to
-
do
and
rejoice
,
as
if
he
have
be
the
good
man
,
and
she
the
good
woman
,
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
after
a
long
sunshine
than
may
have
be
expect
---
of
seven
year
or
so
,
that
be
to
say
---
another
handsome
young
man
start
up
and
eclipse
the
EARL
of
SOMERSET
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
GEORGE
VILLIERS
,
the
young
son
of
a
Leicestershire
gentleman
:
 
who
come
to
Court
with
all
the
Paris
fashion
on
him
,
and
could
dance
as
well
as
the
good
mountebank
that
ever
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
dance
himself
into
the
good
grace
of
his
sowship
,
and
dance
the
other
favourite
out
of
favour
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
it
be
all
at
once
discover
that
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
Somerset
have
not
deserve
all
those
great
promotion
and
mighty
rejoicing
,
and
they
be
separately
try
for
the
murder
of
Sir
Thomas
Overbury
,
and
for
other
crime
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
King
be
so
afraid
of
his
late
favourite
's
publicly
tell
some
disgraceful
thing
he
know
of
him
---
which
he
darkly
threaten
to
do
---
that
he
be
even
examine
with
two

,
one
on
either
side
of
him
,
each
with
a
cloak
in
his
hand
,
ready
to
throw
it
over
his
head
and
stop
his
mouth
if
he
should
break
out
with
what
he
have
it
in
his
power
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
a
very
lame
affair
be
purposely
make
of
the
trial
,
and
his
punishment
be
an
allowance
of
four
thousand
pound
a
year
in
retirement
,
while
the
Countess
be
pardon
,
and
allow
to
pass
into
retirement
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
hate
one
another
by
this
time
,
and
live
to
revile
and
torment
each
other
some
year
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
event
be
in
progress
,
and
while
his
sowship

such
an
exhibition
of
himself
,
from
day
to
day
and
from
year

,
as

<EOS>
the

a
descendant
of
King
Henry

and
who

his
Sowship
think
,
may
consequently
increase
and
strengthen
any
claim

may
one
day
set
up
to
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
She

<EOS>
She

miserable

<EOS>
the
last

and
the
most
important
of
these
three
death
,
be
that
of
Prince
Henry

the
heir
to
the
throne
,
in
the
nineteenth

two
very
good
thing

secondly
,
that
he
be
the
friend
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,

through
all
those
year
in

and

that
no
man
but
his
father
would
keep
such
a
bird
in
such
a
cage
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of

.
 
<EOS>
for
this
young
prince
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
write
,
in
his
prison
in
the
Tower
,
the
beginning
of
a
history
of
the
World
:
 
<EOS>
a
wonderful
instance
how
little
his
sowship
could
do
to
confine
a
great
man
's
mind
<EOS>
,
however
long
he
may
imprison
his
body
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
mention
of
Sir
Walter

,
who
have
many
fault
,
but
who

so
many
merit
as
in
trouble
and
adversity
,
may
bring
me
at
once
to
the
end
of
his
sad
story
.
 
<EOS>
after

of
twelve
long

propose
to
resume
those
old
sea

and
to

gold
.
 
<EOS>
His
Sowship
,
divide
between
his
wish
to
be
on
good
term
with
the
Spaniards
through
whose
territory
Sir
Walter
must
pass
(
he
have
long
have
an
idea
of
marry
Prince
Henry
to
a
Spanish
Princess
)
,
and
his
avaricious
eagerness
to
get
hold
of
the
gold
,
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
end
,
he
set
Sir
Walter
free
,
take
security
for
his
return
;
and
Sir
Walter
fit
out
an
expedition
at
his
own
coast
and

which
he

the
Destiny
.
 
<EOS>
the
expedition

;
the
common
man
,
not
find
the
gold
they
have
expect

who
hate
him
for
old
success
of
his

and

.
 
<EOS>
for
this

and
fortune

-
Admiral
 
---
and
be
once
again
immure
in
his
prison
-
home
of
so
many
year
.
  
<EOS>
His
sowship
be
mightily
disappointed
in
not
get
any
gold
,
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
be
try
as
unfairly
,
and
with
as
many
lie
and
evasion
as
the
judge
and
law
officer
and
every
other
authority
in
Church
and
State
habitually
practise
under
such
a
King
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
great
deal
of
prevarication
on
all
part
but
his
own
,
it
be
declare
that
he
must
die
under
his
former
sentence
,
now
fifteen
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
on
the
twenty
-
eighth
of
October
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighteen
,
he
be
shut
up
in
the
Gate
House
at
Westminster
to
pass
his
late
night
on
earth
,
and
there
he
take
leave
of
his
good
and
faithful
lady
who
be
worthy
to
have
live
in
well
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
eight
o'clock
next
morning
,
after
a
cheerful
breakfast
,
and
a
pipe
,
and
a
cup
of
good
wine
,
he
be
take
to
Old
Palace
Yard
in
Westminster
,
where
the
scaffold
be
set
up
,
and
where
so
many
people
of
high
degree
be
assemble
to
see
him
die
,
that
it
be
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
get
him
through
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
He
behave
most
nobly
,
but
if
anything
lie
heavy
on
his
mind
,
it
be
that
Earl
of
Essex
,
whose
head
he
have
see
roll
off
;
and
he
solemnly
say
that
he
have
have
no
hand
in
bring
him
to
the
block
,
and
that
he
have
shed
tear
for
him
when
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
morning
be
very
cold
,
the
Sheriff
say
,
would
he
come
down
to
a
fire
for
a
little
space
,
and
warm
himself
?
 
<EOS>
but
Sir
Walter
thank
him
,
and
say
no
,
he
would
rather
it
be
do
at
once
,
for
he
be
ill
of
fever
and
ague
,
and
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
his
shake
fit
would
come
upon
him
if
he
be
still
alive
,
and
his
enemy
may
then
suppose
that
he
tremble
for
fear
.
 
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
kneel
and
make
a
very
beautiful
and
christian
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
lay
his
head
upon
the
block
he
feel
the
edge
of
the
axe
,
and
say
,
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
,
that
it
be
a
sharp
medicine
,
but
would
cure
the
bad
disease
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
bent
down
ready
for
death
,
he
say
to
the
executioner
,
find
that
he
hesitate
,
"
what
dost
thou

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
axe

and

<EOS>
He

make
a
viscount
,
he
be
make
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
he
be
make
a
marquis
,
he
be
make
Master
of

and
the

Commander
of
the

<EOS>
He

,
and

<EOS>
He

over
with
diamond
and
other
precious
stone
,
from
his
hatband
and
his
earring
to
his
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
be
an
ignorant
presumptuous
,
swagger
compound
of
knave
and
fool
,
with
nothing
but
his
beauty
and
his
dancing
to
recommend
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
gentleman
who
call
himself
his
Majesty
's
dog
and
slave
,
and
call
his
Majesty
Your
Sowship
.
 
<EOS>
His
sowship
call
him
STEENIE
;
it
be
suppose
,
because
that
be
a
nickname
for
Stephen
,
and
because
St
Stephen
be
generally
represent
in
picture
as
a
handsome
saint
.
  
<EOS>
His
sowship
be
drive
sometimes
to
his
wits'-end
by
his
trim
between
the
general
dislike
of
the
catholic
religion
at
home
,
and
his
desire
to
wheedle
and
flatter
it
abroad
,
as
his
only
mean
of
get
a
rich
princess
for
his
son
's
wife
:
 
a
part
of
whose
fortune
he
may
cram
into
his
greasy
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Charles
---
<EOS>
or
as
his
sowship
call
him
,
Baby
Charles
---
<EOS>
be
now
PRINCE
of
WALES
,
the
old
project
of
a
marriage
with
the
spanish
King
's
daughter
have
be
revive
for
him
;
and
as
she
could
not
marry
a
Protestant
without
leave
from
the
Pope
,
his
sowship
himself
secretly
and
meanly
write
to
his
infallibility
,
ask
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
negotiation
for
this
spanish
marriage
take
up
a
large
space
in
great
book
,
than
you
can
imagine
,
but
the
upshot
of
it
all
be
,
that
when
it
have
be
hold
off
by
the
Spanish
Court
for
a
long
time
,
Baby
Charles
and
Steenie
set
off
in
disguise
as
Mr
Thomas
Smith
and
Mr
John
Smith
,
to
see
the
Spanish
Princess
;
that
Baby
Charles
pretend
to
be
desperately
in
love
with
her
,
and
jump
off
wall
to
look
at
her
,
and
make
a
considerable
fool
of
himself
in
a
good
many
way
;
that
she
be
call
Princess
of
Wales
and
that
the
whole
Spanish
Court
believe
Baby
Charles
to
be
all
but
die
for
her
sake
,
as
he
expressly
tell
them
he
be
;
that
Baby
Charles
and
Steenie
come
back
to
England
,
and
be
receive
with
as
much
rapture
as
if
they
have
be
a
blessing
to
it
;
that
Baby
Charles
have
actually
fall
in
love
with
HENRIETTA
MARIA
,
the
french
King
's
sister
,
whom
he
have
see
in
Paris
;
that
he
think
it
a
wonderfully
fine
and
princely
thing
to
have
deceive
the
Spaniards
,
all
through
;
and
that
he
openly
say
,
with
a
chuckle
,
as
soon
as
he
be
safe
and
sound
at
home
again
,
that
the
Spaniards
be
great
fool
to
have
believe
him
.
  
<EOS>
like
most
dishonest
man
,
the
Prince
and
the
favourite
complain
that
the
people
whom
they
have
delude
be
dishonest
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
such
misrepresentation
of
the
treachery
of
the
Spaniards
in
this
business
of
the
spanish
match
,
that
the
english
nation
become
eager
for
a
war
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
although
the
gravest
Spaniards
laugh
at
the
idea
of
his
Sowship
in
a
warlike
attitude
,
the
Parliament
grant
money
for
the
beginning
of
hostility
,
and
the
treaty
with
Spain
be
publicly
declare
to
be
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
the
spanish
ambassador
in
London
---
probably
with
the
help
of
the
fall
favourite
,
the
Earl
of
Somerset
---
be
unable
to
obtain
speech
with
his
Sowship
,
slip
a
paper
into
his
hand
,
declare
that
he
be
a
prisoner
in
his
own
house
,
and
be
entirely
govern
by
Buckingham
and
his
creature
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
effect
of
this
letter
be
that
his
sowship
begin
to
cry
and
whine
,
and
take
Baby
Charles
away
from
Steenie
,
and
go
down
to
Windsor
,
gabble
all
sort
of
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
be
that
his
sowship
hug
his
dog
and
slave
,
and
say
he
be
quite
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
give
the
Prince
and
the
favourite
almost
unlimited
power
to
settle
anything
with
the
Pope
as
to
the
spanish
marriage
;
and
he
now
,
with
a
view
to
the
french
one
,
sign
a
treaty
that
all
Roman
Catholics
in
England
should
exercise
their
religion
freely
,
and
should
never
be
require
to
take
any
oath
contrary
thereto
.
 
<EOS>
in
return
for
this
,
and
for
other
concession
much
less
to
be
defend
,
Henrietta
Maria
be
to
become
the
Prince
's
wife
,
and
be
to
bring
him
a
fortune
of
eight
hundred
thousand
crown
.
  
<EOS>
His
sowship
's
eye
be
get
red
with
eagerly
look
for
the
money
,
when
the
end
of
a
gluttonous
life
come
upon
him
;
and
,
after
a
fortnight
's
illness
,
on
Sunday
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
March
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
,
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
reign
twenty
-
two
year
,
and
be
fifty
-
nine
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
of
nothing
more
abominable
in
history
than
the
adulation
that
be
lavish
on
this
King
,
and
the
vice
and
corruption
that
such
a
barefaced
habit
of
lie
produce
in
his
court
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
much
to
be
doubt
whether
one
man
of
honour
,
and
not
utterly
self
-
disgrace
,
keep
his
place
near
James
the
First
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bacon
,
that
able
and
wise
philosopher
,
as
the
First
Judge
in
the
Kingdom
in
this
reign
,
become
a
public
spectacle
of
dishonesty
and
corruption
;
and
in
his
base
flattery
of
his
Sowship
,
and
in
his
crawling
servility
to
his
dog
and
slave
,
disgrace
himself
even
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
a
creature
like
his
Sowship
set
upon
a
throne
be
like
the
Plague
,
and
everybody
receive
infection
from
him
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Charles
<EOS>
the
first
    
BABY
CHARLES
become
king
charle
the
FIRST
,
in
the
twenty
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
unlike
his
father
,
he
be
usually
amiable
in
his
private
character
,
and
grave
and
dignified
in
his
bearing
;
but
,
like
his
father
,
he
have
monstrously
exaggerate
notion
of
the
right
of
a
king
,
and
be
evasive
,
and
not
to
be
trust
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
word
could
have
be
rely
upon
,
his
history
may
have
have
a
different
end
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
care
be
to
send
over
that
insolent
upstart
,
Buckingham
,
to
bring
Henrietta
Maria
from
Paris
to
be
his
Queen
;
<EOS>
upon
which
occasion
Buckingham
---
with
his
usual
audacity
---
make
love
to
the
young
Queen
of
Austria
,
and
be
very
indignant
indeed
with
CARDINAL
RICHELIEU
,
the
French
Minister
,
for
thwart
his
intention
.
 
<EOS>
the
english
people
be
very
well
disposed
to
like
their
new
Queen
,
and
to
receive
her
with
great
favour
when
she
come
among
them
as
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
she
hold
the
protestant
religion
in
great
dislike
,
and
bring
over
a
crowd
of
unpleasant
priest
,
who
make
her
do
some
very
ridiculous
thing
,
and
force
themselves
upon
the
public
notice
in
many
disagreeable
way
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
the
people
soon
come
to
dislike
her
,
and
she
soon
come
to
dislike
them
;
and
she
do
so
much
all
through
this
reign
in
set
the
King
(
who
be
dotingly
fond
of
her
)
against
his
subject
,
that
it
would
have
be
well
for
him
if
she
have
never
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
you
be
to
understand
that
King
Charles
the
first
---
of
his
own
determination
to
be
a
high
and
mighty
King
not
to
be
call
to
account
by
anybody
,
and
urge
on
by
his
Queen
besides
---
deliberately
set
himself
to
put
his
Parliament
down
and
to
put
himself
up
.
<EOS>
You
be
also
to
understand
,
that
even
in
pursuit
of
this
wrong
idea
(
enough
in
itself
to
have
ruin
any
king
)
<EOS>
he
never
take
a
straight
course
,
but
always
take
a
crooked
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
bent
upon
war
with
Spain
,
though
neither
the
House
of
Commons
nor
the
people
be
quite
clear
as
to
the
justice
of
that
war
,
now
that
they
begin
to
think
a
little
more
about
the
story
of
the
spanish
match
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
King
rush
into
it
hotly
,
raise
money
by
illegal
mean
to
meet
its
expense
,
and
encounter
a
miserable
failure
at
Cadiz
,
in
the
very
first
year
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
an
expedition
to
Cadiz
have
be
make
in
the
hope
of
plunder
,
but
as
it
be
not
successful
,
it
be
necessary
to
get
a
grant
of
money
from
the
Parliament
;
and
when
they
meet
,
in
no
very
complying
humour
,
the
,
King
tell
them
,
"
to
make
haste
to
let
him
have
it
,
or
it
would
be
the
bad
for
themselves
.
"
 
<EOS>
not
put
in
a
more
comply
humour
by
this
,
they
impeach
the
King
's
favourite
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
as
the
cause
(
which
he
undoubtedly
be
)
of
many
great
public
grievance
and
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
to
save
him
,
dissolve
the
Parliament
without
get
the
money
he
want
;
and
when
the
Lords
implore
him
to
consider
and
grant
a
little
delay
,
he
reply
,
"
no
,
not
one
minute
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
raise
money
for
himself
by
the
follow
mean
among
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
levy
certain
duty
call
tonnage
and
poundage
which
have
not
be
grant
by
the
Parliament
,
and
could
lawfully
be
levy
by
no
other
power
;
he
call
upon
the
seaport
town
to
furnish
,
and
to
pay
all
the
cost
for
three
month
of
,
a
fleet
of
armed
ship
;
and
he
require
the
people
to
unite
in
lend
him
large
sum
of
money
,
the
repayment
of
which
be
very
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
poor
people
refuse
,
they
be
press
as
soldier
or
sailor
;
if
the
gentry
refuse
,
they
be
send
to
prison
.
 
<EOS>
five
gentleman
,
name
SIR
THOMAS
DARNEL
,
JOHN
CORBET
,
WALTER
EARL
,
JOHN
HEVENINGHAM
,
and
EVERARD
HAMPDEN

for
refuse

take
up
by
a
warrant
of
the
King
's
privy
council
,
and
be
send
to
prison
without
any
cause
but
the
King
's
pleasure
be
state
for
their
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
question
come
to
be
solemnly
try
,
whether
this
be
not
a
violation
of
Magna
Charta
,
and
an
encroachment
by
the
King
on
the
high
right
of
the
english
people
.
 
<EOS>
His
lawyer
contend
<EOS>
no
,
because
to
encroach
upon
the
right
of
the
english
people
would
be
to
do
wrong
,
and
the
King
could
do
no
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
the
accommodate
judge
decide
in
favour
of
this
wicked
nonsense
;
and
here
be
a
fatal
division
between
the
King
and
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
for
all
this
,
it
become
necessary
to
call
another
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
,
sensible
of
the
danger
in
which
their
liberty
be
,
choose
for
it
those
who
be
best
known
for
their
determined
opposition
to
the
king
;
but
still
the
King
,
quite
blind
by
his
determination
to
carry
everything
before
him
,
address
them
when
they
meet
,
in
a
contemptuous
manner
,
and
just
tell
them
in
so
many
word
that
he
have
only
call
them
together
because
he
want
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
,
strong
enough
and
resolute
enough
to
know
that
they
would
lower
his
tone
,
care
little
for
what
he
say
,
and
lay
before
him
one
of
the
great
document
of
history
,
which
be
call
the
petition
of
RIGHT
,
require
that
the
free
man
of
England
should
no
longer
be
call
upon
to
lend
the
King
money
,
and
should
no
longer
be
press
or
imprison
for
refuse
to
do
so
;
further
,
that
the
free
man
of
England
should
no
longer
be
seize
by
the
King
's
special
mandate
or
warrant
,
it
be
contrary
to
their
right
and
liberty
and
the
law
of
their
country
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
the
King
return
an
answer
to
this
petition
,
in
which
he
try
to
shirk
it
altogether
;
but
,
the
House
of
Commons
then
show
their
determination
to
go
on
with
the
impeachment
of
Buckingham
,
the
king
in
alarm
return
an
answer
,
give
his
consent
to
all
that
be
require
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
not
only
afterwards
depart
from
his
word
and
honour
on
these
point
,
over
and
over
again
,
but
,
at
this
very
time
,
he
do
the
mean
and
dissembling
act
of
publish
his
first
answer
and
not
his
second
---
merely
that
the
people
may
suppose
that
the
Parliament
have
not
get
the
well
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
that
pestilent
Buckingham
,
to
gratify
his
own
wounded
vanity
,
have
by
this
time
involve
the
country
in
war
with
France
,
as
well
as
with
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
for
such
miserable
cause
and
such
miserable
creature
be
war
sometimes
make
!
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
destine
to
do
little
more
mischief
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
one
morning
,
as
he
be
go
out
of
his
house
to
his
carriage
,
he
turn
to
speak
to
a
certain
Colonel
FRYER
who
be
with
him
;
and
he
be
violently
stab
with
a
knife
,
which
the
murderer
leave
stick
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
this
happen
in
his
hall
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
angry
word
up
-
stair
,
just
before
,
with
some
french
gentleman
,
who
be
immediately
suspect
by
his
servant
,
and
have
a
close
escape
from
be
set
upon
and
kill
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
,
the
real
murderer
,
who
have
go
to
the
kitchen
and
may
easily
have
get
away
,
draw
his
sword
and
cry
out
,
"
I
be
the
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
JOHN
FELTON
,
a
Protestant
and
a
retired
officer
in
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
have
no
personal
ill
-
will
to
the
Duke
,
but
have
kill
him
as
a
curse
to
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
aim
his
blow
well
,
for
Buckingham
have
only
have
time
to
cry
out
,
"
Villain
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
draw
out
the
knife
,
fall
against
a
table
,
and
die
.
  
<EOS>
the
council
make
a
mighty
business
of
examine
John
Felton
about
this
murder
,
though
it
be
a
plain
case
enough
,
one
would
think
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
seventy
mile
to
do
it
,
he
tell
them
,
and
he
do
it
for
the
reason
he
have
declare
;
if
they
put
him
upon
the
rack
,
as
that
noble
MARQUIS
of
DORSET
whom
he
see
before
him
,
have
the
goodness
to
threaten
,
he
give
that
marquis
warning
,
that
he
would
accuse
him
as
his
accomplice
!
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
unpleasantly
anxious
to
have
him
rack
,
nevertheless
;
but
as
the
judge
now
find
out
that
torture
be
contrary
to
the
law
of
England
---
it
be
a
pity
they
do
not
make
the
discovery
a
little
sooner
---
John
Felton
be
simply
execute
for
the
murder
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
a
murder
it
undoubtedly
be
,
and
not
in
the
least
to
be
defend
:
 
though
he
have
free
England
from
one
of
the
most
profligate
,
contemptible
,
and
base
court
<EOS>
favourite
to
whom
it
have
ever

<EOS>
a
very
different
man
now
arise
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
SIR
THOMAS
WENTWORTH
,
a
Yorkshire
gentleman
,
who
have
sit
in
Parliament
for
a
long
time

and
who
have
favour
arbitrary
and
haughty
principle
,
but
who
have
go
over
to
the
people
's
side
on
receive
offence
from
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
the
King
,
much
want
such
a
man
---
for
,
besides
be
naturally
favourable
to
the
King
's
cause
,
he
have
great
ability
---
make
him
first
a
Baron
,
and
then
a
Viscount
,
and
give
him
high
employment
,
and
win
him
most
completely
.
  
<EOS>
a
Parliament
,
however
,
be
still
in
existence
,
and
be
not
to
be
win
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
twentieth
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
twenty
-
nine
,
SIR
JOHN
ELIOT
,
a
great
man
who
have
be
active
in
the
Petition
of
Right
,
bring
forward
other
strong
resolution
against
the
King
's
chief
instrument
,
and
call
upon
the
Speaker
to
put
them
to
the
vote
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
the
Speaker
answer
,
"
he
be
command
otherwise
by
the
King
,
"
and
get
up
to
leave
the
chair
---
which
,
accord
to
the
rule
of
the
House
of
Commons
would
have
oblige
it
to
adjourn
without
do
anything
more
---
when
two
member
,
name
Mr
HOLLIS
and
Mr
VALENTINE
,
hold
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
a
scene
of
great
confusion
arise
among
the
member
;
and
while
many
sword
be
draw
and
flash
about
,
the
King
,
who
be
keep
inform
of
all
that
be
go
on
,
tell
the
captain
of
his
guard
to
go
down
to
the
House
and
force
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
resolution
be
by
that
time
,
however
,
vote
,
and
the
House
adjourn
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Eliot
and
those
two
member
who
have
hold
the
Speaker
down
,
be
quickly
summon
before
the
council
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
claim
it
to
be
their
privilege
not
to
answer
out
of
Parliament
for
anything
they
have
say
in
it
,
they
be
commit
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
then
go
down
and
dissolve
the
Parliament
,
in
a
speech
wherein
he
make
mention
of
these
gentleman
as
"
Vipers
"
---
which
do
not
do
him
much
good
that
ever
I
have
hear
of
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
refuse
to
gain
their
liberty
by
say
they
be
sorry
for
what
they
have
do
,
the
King
,
always
remarkably
unforgive
,
never
overlook
their
offence
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
demand
to
be
bring
up
before
the
court
of
King
's
Bench
,
he
even
resort
to
the
meanness
of
have
them
move
about
from
prison
to
prison
,
so
that
the
writ
issue
for
that
purpose
should
not
legally
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
they
come
before
the
court
and
be
sentence
to
heavy
fine
,
and
to
be
imprison
during
the
King
's
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
when
Sir
John
Eliot
's
health
have
quite
give
way
,
and
he
so
long
for
change
of
air
and
scene
as
to
petition
for
his
release
,
the
King
send
back
the
answer
(
worthy
of
his
Sowship
himself
)
that
the
petition
be
not
humble
enough
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
send
another
petition
by
his
young
son
,
in
which
he
pathetically
offer
to
go
back
to
prison
when
his
health
be
restore
,
if
he
may
be
release
for
its
recovery
,
the
King
still
disregard
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
die
in
the
Tower
,
and
his
child
petition
to
be
allow
to
take
his
body
down
to
Cornwall
,
there
to
lay
it
among
the
ashe
of
his
forefather
,
the
King
return
for
answer
,
"
let
Sir
John
Eliot
's
body
be
bury
in
the
church
of
that
parish
where
he
die
.
"
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
like
a
very
little
King
indeed
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
for
twelve
long
year
,
steadily
pursue
his
design
of
set
himself
up
and
put
the
people
down
,
the
King
call
no
Parliament
;
but
rule
without
one
.
 
<EOS>
if
twelve
thousand
volume
be
write
in
his
praise
(
as
a
good
many
have

it
would
still
remain
a
fact

impossible
to
be
deny

that
for
twelve
year
King
Charles

first

in
England
unlawfully

despotically

seize
upon

<EOS>
It
be
a
fashion
with
some
people
to
think
that
this
King
's
career
be
cut
short
;
but
I
must
say
myself
that
I
think
he
run
a
pretty
long
one

<EOS>
WILLIAM
LAUD
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
be
the
King
's
right
-
hand
man
in
the
religious
part
of
the
putting
down
of
the
people
's
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Laud
,
who
be
a
sincere
man
,
of
large
learning
but
small
sense
---
for
the
two
thing
sometimes
go
together
in
very
different
quantity
---
though
a
Protestant
,
hold
opinion
so
near
those
of
the
Catholics
,
that
the
Pope
want
to
make
a
Cardinal
of
him
,
if
he
would
have
accept
that
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
upon
vow
,
robe
,
light
candle
,
image
,
and
so
forth
,
as
amazingly
important
in
religious
ceremony
;
and
he
bring
in
an
immensity
of
bowing
and
candle
-
snuffing
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
regard
archbishop
and
bishop
as
a
sort
of
miraculous
person
,
and
be
inveterate
in
the
last
degree
against
any
who
think
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
offer
up
thank
to
Heaven
,
and
be
in
a
state
of
much
pious
pleasure
,
when
a
Scotch
clergyman
,
name
LEIGHTON
,
be
pillory
,
whip
,
brand
in
the
cheek
,
and
have
one
of
his
ear
cut
off
and
one
of
his

for

He

the

a

<EOS>
He
highly
approve
of
the
punishment
of
DOCTOR

who
be
also
fine
a
thousand
pound

and
who
afterwards
have
his
ear
cut
off

and
be
imprison
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
gentle
method
of
persuasion
,
some
will
tell
you
:
 
I
think
,
they
be
rather
calculate
to
be
alarming
to
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
money
part
of
the
putting
down
of
the
people
's
liberty
,
the
King
be
equally
gentle
,
as
some
will
tell
you
:
 
as
I
think
,
equally
alarming
.
 
<EOS>
He
levy
those
duty
of
tonnage
and
poundage
,
and
increase
them
as
he
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
He
grant
monopoly
to
company
of
merchant
on
their
pay
him
for
them
,
notwithstanding
the
great
complaint
that
have
,
for
year
and
year
,
be
make
on
the
subject
of
monopoly
.
 
<EOS>
He
fine
the
people
for
disobey
proclamation
issue
by
his
Sowship
in
direct
violation
of
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
revive
the
detest
Forest
law
,
and
take
private
property
to
himself
as
his
forest
right
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
he
determine
to
have
what
be
call
Ship
Money
;
that
be
to
say
,
money
for
the
support
of
the
fleet
---
not
only
from
the
seaport
,
but
from
all
the
county
of
England
:
 
<EOS>
have
find
out
that
,
in
some
ancient
time
or
other
,
all
the
county
pay
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
grievance
of
this
ship
money
be
somewhat
too
strong
,
JOHN
CHAMBERS
,
a
citizen
of
London
,
refuse
to
pay
his
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
the
Lord
Mayor
order
John
Chambers
to
prison
,
and
for
that
John
Chambers
bring
a
suit
against
the
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
LORD
say
,
also
,
behave
like
a
real
nobleman
,
and
declare
he
would
not
pay
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
sturdy
and
good
opponent
of
the
ship
money
be
JOHN
HAMPDEN
,
a
gentleman
of
Buckinghamshire
,
who
have
sit
among
the
"
viper
"
in
the
House
of
Commons
when
there
be
such
a
thing
,
and
who
have
be
the
bosom
friend
of
Sir
John
Eliot
.
 
<EOS>
this
case
be
try
before
the
twelve
judge
in
the
Court
of
Exchequer
,
and
again
the
King
's
lawyer
say
it
be
impossible
that
ship
money
could
be
wrong
,
because
the
King
could
do
no
wrong
,
however
hard
he
try
---
and
he
really
do
try
very
hard
during
these
twelve
year
.
 
<EOS>
seven
of
the
judge
say
that
be
quite
true
,
and
Mr
Hampden
be
bind
to
pay
:
 
<EOS>
five
of
the
judge
say
that
be
quite
false
,
and
Mr
Hampden
be
not
bind
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
King
triumph
(
as
he
think
)
,
by
make
Hampden
the
most
popular
man
in
England
;
where
matter
be
get
to
that
height
now
,
that
many
honest
englishman
could
not
endure
their
country
,
and
sail
away
across
the
sea
to
find
a
colony
in
Massachusetts
Bay
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
Hampden
himself
and
his
relation
OLIVER
CROMWELL
be
go
with
a
company
of
such
voyager
,
and
be
actually
on
board
ship
,
when
they
be
stop
by
a
proclamation
,
prohibit
sea
captain
to
carry
out
such
passenger
without
the
royal
license
.
 
<EOS>
but
o
!
<EOS>
it
would
have
be
well
for
the
king
if
he
have
let
them
go
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
state
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
if
Laud
have
be
a
madman
just
break
loose
,
he
could
not
have
do
more
mischief
than
he
do
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
endeavour
(
in
which
he
be
second
by
the
King
,
then
in
person
in
that
part
of
his
dominion
)
to
force
his
own
idea
of
bishop
,
and
his
own
religious
form
and
ceremony
upon
the
Scotch
,
he
rouse
that
nation
to
a
perfect
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
They
form
a
solemn
league
,
which
they
call
the
Covenant
,
for
the
preservation
of
their
own
religious
form
;
they
rise
in
arm
throughout
the
whole
country
;
they
summon
all
their
man
to
prayer
and
sermon
twice
a
day
by
beat
of
drum
;
they
sing
psalm
,
in
which
they
compare
their
enemy
to
all
the
evil
spirit
that
ever
be
hear
of
;
and
they
solemnly
vow
to
smite
them
with
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
the
King
try
force
,
then
treaty
,
then
a
Scottish
Parliament
which
do
not
answer
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
try
the
EARL
of
STRAFFORD
,
formerly
Sir
Thomas
Wentworth
;
who
,
as
LORD
WENTWORTH
,
have
be
govern
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
have
carry
it
with
a
very
high
hand
there
,
though
to
the
benefit
and
prosperity
of
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
Strafford
and
Laud
be
for
conquer
the
scottish
people
by
force
of
arm
.
 
<EOS>
other
lord
who
be
take
into
council
,
recommend
that
a
Parliament
should
at
last
be
call
;
to
which
the
King
unwillingly
consent
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
on
the
thirteenth
of
April
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
,
that
then
strange
sight
,
a
Parliament
,
be
see
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
call
the
Short
Parliament
,
for
it
last
a
very
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
member
be
all
look
at
one
another
,
doubtful
who
would
dare
to
speak
,
MR

<EOS>
PYM
arise
and
set
forth
all
that
the
King
have
do
unlawfully
during
the
past
twelve
year
,
and
what
be
the
position
to
which
England
be
reduce
.
 
<EOS>
this
great
example
set
,
other
member
take
courage
and
speak
the
truth
freely
,
though
with
great
patience
and
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
a
little
frightened
,
send
to
say
that
if
they
would
grant
him
a
certain
sum
on
certain
term
,
no
more
ship
money
should
be
raise
.
 
<EOS>
They
debate
the
matter
for
two
day
;
and
then
,
as
they
would
not
give
him
all
he
ask
without
promise
or
inquiry
,
he
dissolve
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
know
very
well
that
he
must
have
a
Parliament
now
;
and
he
begin
to
make
that
discovery
too
,
though
rather
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
wherefore
,
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
September
,
be
then
at
York
with
an
army
collect
against
the
scottish
people
,
but
his
own
man
sullen
and
discontent
like
the
rest
of
the
nation
,
the
King
tell
the
great
council
of
the
Lords
,
whom
he
have
call
to
meet
him
there
,
that
he
would
summon
another
Parliament
to
assemble
on
the
third
of
November
.
 
<EOS>
the
soldier
of
the
Covenant
have
now
force
their
way
into
England
and
have
take
possession
of
the
northern
county
,
where
the
coal
be
get
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
would
never
do
to
be
without
coal
,
and
as
the
King
's
troop
could
make
no
head
against
the
Covenanters
so
full
of
gloomy
zeal
,
a
truce
be
make
,
and
a
treaty
with
Scotland
be
take
into
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
northern
county
pay
the
Covenanters
to
leave
the
coal
alone
,
and
keep
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
now
dispose
of
the
Short
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
next
to
see
what
memorable
thing

do
by
the
Long

<EOS>
Second
Part
    
<EOS>
the
Long

<EOS>
that
day
week
the
Earl

from
York
,
very
sensible
that
the
spirited
and
determined
man
who
form
that
Parliament
be
no
friend
towards
him
,
who
have
not
only
desert
the
cause
of
the
people
,
but
who
have
on
all
occasion
oppose
himself
to
their
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
tell
him
,
for
his
comfort
,
that
the
Parliament
"
should
not
hurt
one
hair
of
his
head
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
very
next
day
Mr
Pym
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
with
great
solemnity
,
impeach
the
Earl
of
Strafford
as
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
take

<EOS>
It
be
the
twenty
-
second
of
March
before
he
be
bring

trial
in
Westminster
Hall
;
where
,
although
he
be
very
ill
and
suffer
great
pain
,
he
defend
himself
with
such
ability
and
majesty
,
that
it
be
doubtful
whether
he
would
not
get
the
good
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
trial
,
Pym
produce
in
the
House
of
Commons
a
copy
of
some
note
of
a

a
red
velvet
cabinet
belong
to
his
father
(
Secretary
Vane

the
council
-
table
with
the
Earl

,
in
which
Strafford
have
distinctly
tell
the
King
that
he
be
free
from
all
rule
and
obligation
of
government
,
and
may
do
with
his
people
whatever
he
like
;
and
in
which
he
have
add
---
"
You
have
an
army
in
Ireland
that
you
may
employ
to
reduce
this
kingdom
to
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
clear
whether
by
the
word
"
<EOS>
this
kingdom
,
"
he
have
really
mean
England
or
Scotland
;
but
the
Parliament
contend
that
he
mean
England
,
and
this
be
treason
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
sitting
of
the
House
of
Commons
it
be
resolve
to
bring
in
a
bill
of
attainder
declare
the
treason
to
have
be
commit
:
 
in
preference
to
proceed
with
the
trial
by
impeachment
,
which
would
have
require
the
treason
to
be
prove
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
a
bill

in
at
once
,
be
carry
through
the
House
of
Commons
by
a
large
majority
,
and

<EOS>
while
it
be
still
uncertain
whether
the
House
of
Lords
would
pass
it
and
the
King
consent
to
it
,

and
also
to

two
hundred
soldier

the
Tower
of
London
to

<EOS>
the
plotting
with
the
army

reveal
by
one
GEORGE
GORING

the
son
of
a
lord
of
that
name

a
bad
fellow
who

one
of
the
original

<EOS>
the
King
have
actually
give
his
warrant
for
the
admission
of
the
two
hundred
man
into
the
Tower
,
and
they
would
have
get
in
too
,
but
for
the
refusal
of
the
governor
---
a
sturdy
Scotchman
of
the
name
of
BALFOUR
---
to
admit
them
.
 
<EOS>
these

Houses
of
Parliament
,
and
to
cry
out
for
the
execution
of
the
Earl

as
one
of

a
faithful
servant
,
though
he
have
no
great

in
some
doubt
what

but
he

his
consent
to
both
bill
,
although
he
in
his
heart
believe
that
the
bill

unlawful
and
unjust

<EOS>
the
Earl
have
write
to
him
,
tell
him
that
he
be
willing
to
die
for
his

<EOS>
but
he
have
not

that
his
royal
master
would
take

at
his
word
quite
so
readily

when
he
hear
his
doom

he

his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
say
,
"
put
not

"
  
<EOS>
the
King

who
never
could
be
straightforward
and
plain

through
one
single
day
or
through
one
single
sheet
of
paper
,
write
a
letter
to

<EOS>
in
a
postscript
to

"
if

him
till
Saturday

<EOS>
"
 
if

,
be
now
confine
in
the
Tower
too
;
and
when
the
Earl
go
by
his
window
to
his
death
,
he
be
there
,
at
his
request
,
to
give
him
his
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
great
friend
in
the
King
's
cause
,
and
the
Earl
have
write
to
him
in
the
day
of
their
power
that
he
think
it
would
be
an
admirable
thing
to
have
Mr
Hampden
publicly
whip
for
refuse
to
pay
the
ship
money
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
those
high
and
mighty
doing
be
over
now
,
and
the
Earl
go
his
way
to
death
with
dignity
and
heroism
.
 
<EOS>
the
governor
wish
him
to
get
into
a
coach
at
the
Tower
gate
,
for
fear
the
people
should
tear
him
to
piece
;
but
he
say
it
be
all
one
to
him
whether
he
die
by
the
axe
or
by
the
people
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
walk
,
with
a
firm
tread
and
a
stately
look
,
and
sometimes
pull
off
his
hat
to
them
as
he
pass
along
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
profoundly
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
speech
on
the
scaffold
from
some
note
he
have
prepare
(
the
paper
be
find
lie
there
after
his
head
be
strike
off
)
,
and
one
blow
of
the
axe
kill
him
,
in
the
forty
-
ninth
year
of
his
age
.
  
<EOS>
this
bold
and
daring
act
,
the
Parliament
accompany
by
other
famous
measure
,
all
originate
(
as
even
this
do
)
in
the
King
's
have
so
grossly
and
so
long
abuse
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
DELINQUENTS
be
apply
to
all
sheriff
and
other
officer
who
have
be
concern
in
raise
the
ship
money
,
or
any
other
money
,
from
the
people
,
in
an
unlawful
manner
;
the
Hampden
judgment
be
reverse
;
the
judge
who
have
decide
against
Hampden
be
call
upon
to
give
large
security
that
they
would
take
such
consequence
as
Parliament
may
impose
upon
them
;
and
one
be
arrest
as
he
sit
in
High
Court
,
and
carry
off
to
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Laud
be
impeach
;
the
unfortunate
victim
whose
ear
have
be
crop
and
whose
nose
have
be
slit
,
be
bring
out
of
prison
in
triumph
;
and
a
bill
be
pass
declare
that
a
Parliament
should
be
call
every
third
year
,
and
that
if
the
King
and
the
King
's
officer
do
not
call
it
,
the
people
should
assemble
of
themselves
and
summon
it
,
as
of
their
own
right
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
great
illumination
and
rejoicing
take
place
over
all
these
thing
,
and
the
country
be
wildly
excited
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
Parliament
take
advantage
of
this
excitement
and
stir
them
up
by
every
mean
,
there
be
no
doubt
;
but
you
be
always
to
remember
those
twelve
long
year
,
during
which
the
King
have
try
so
hard
whether
he
really
could
do
any
wrong
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
there
be
a
great
religious
outcry
against
the
right
of
the
Bishops
to
sit
in
Parliament
;
to
which
the
scottish
people
particularly
object
.
 
<EOS>
the
English
be
divide
on
this
subject
,
and
,
partly
on
this
account
and
partly
because
they
have
have
foolish
expectation
that
the
Parliament
would
be
able
to
take
off
nearly
all
the
taxis
,
number
of
them
sometimes
waver
and
incline
towards
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
myself
,
that
if
,
at
this
or
almost
any
other
period
of
his
life
,
the
King
could
have
be
trust
by
any
man
not
out
of
his
sense
,
he
may
have
save
himself
and
keep
his
throne
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
english
army
be
disband
,
he
plot
with
the
officer
again
,
as
he
have
do
before
,
and
establish
the
fact
beyond
all
doubt
by
put
his
signature
of
approval
to
a
petition
against
the
parliamentary
leader
,
which
be
draw
up
by
certain
officer
.
<EOS>
when
the
scottish
army
be
disband
,
he
go
to
Edinburgh
in
four
day
---
which
be
go
very
fast
at
that
time
---
to
plot
again
,
and
so
darkly
too
,
that
it
be
difficult
to
decide
what
his
whole
object
be
.
 
<EOS>
some
suppose
that
he
want
to
gain
over
the
Scottish
Parliament
,
as
he
do
in
fact
gain
over
,
by
present
and
favour
,
many
scottish
lord
and
man
of
power
.
 
<EOS>
some
think
that
he
go
to
get
proof
against
the
parliamentary
leader
in
England
of
their
have
treasonably
invite
the
scottish
people
to
come
and
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
whatever
object
he
go
to
Scotland
,
he
do
little
good
by
go
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
instigation
of
the
EARL
of
MONTROSE
,
a
desperate
man
who
be
then
in
prison
for
plot
,
he
try
to
kidnap
three
scottish
lord
who
escape
.
 
<EOS>
a
committee
of
the
Parliament
at
home
,
who
have
follow
to
watch
him
,
write
an
account
of
this
INCIDENT
,
as
it
be
call
,
to
the
Parliament
<EOS>
,
the
Parliament
make
a
fresh
stir
about
it
;
be
,
or
feign
to
be
,
much
alarm
for
themselves
;
and
write
to
the
EARL
of
ESSEX
,
the
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
for
a
guard
to
protect
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
absolutely
prove
that
the
King
plot
in
Ireland
besides
,
but
it
be
very
probable
that
he
do
,
and
that
the
Queen
do
,
and
that
he
have
some
wild
hope
of
gain
the
irish
people
over
to
his
side
by
favour
a
rise
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
whether
or
no
,
they
do
rise
in
a
most
brutal
and
savage
rebellion
;
in
which
,
encourage
by
their
priest
,
they
commit
such
atrocity
upon
number
of
the
English
,
of
both
sex
and
of
all
age
,
as
nobody
could
believe
,
but
for
their
be
relate
on
oath
by
eye
-
witness
.
<EOS>
whether
one
hundred
thousand
or
two
hundred
thousand
Protestants
be
murder
in
this
outbreak
,
be
uncertain
;
but
,
that
it
be
as
ruthless
and
barbarous
an
outbreak
as
ever
be
know
among
any
savage
people
,
be
certain
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
come
home
from
Scotland
,
determine
to
make
a
great
struggle
for
his
lose
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
that
,
through
his
present
and
favour
,
Scotland
would
take
no
part
against
him
;
and
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
receive
him
with
such
a
magnificent
dinner
that
he
think
he
must
have
become
popular
again
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
take
a
good
many
Lord
Mayors
,
however
,
to
make
a
people
,
and
the
King
soon
find
himself
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
not
so
soon
,
though
,
but
that
there
be
a
great
opposition
in
the
Parliament
to
a
celebrated
paper
put
forth
by
Pym
and
Hampden
and
the
rest
,
call
"
the
remonstrance
,
"
which
set
forth
all
the
illegal
act
that
the
King
have
ever
do
,
but
politely
lay
the
blame
of
them
on
his
bad
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
it
be
pass
and
present
to
him
,
the
King
still
think
himself
strong
enough
to
discharge
Balfour
from
his
command
in
the
Tower
,
and
to
put
in
his
place
a
man
of
bad
character
;
to
whom
the
Commons
instantly
object
,
and
whom
he
be
oblige
to
abandon
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
time
,
the
old
outcry
about
the
Bishops
become
loud
than
ever
,
and
the
old
Archbishop
of
York
be
so
near
be
murder
as
he
go
down
to
the
House
of
Lords
---
be
lay
hold
of
by
the
mob
and
violently
knock
about
,
in
return
for
very
foolishly
scold
a
shrill
boy
who
be
yelp
out
"
no
Bishops
!
"
<EOS>
---
that
he
send
for
all
the
Bishops
who
be
in
town
,
and
propose
to
them
to
sign
a
declaration
that
,
as
they
could
no
longer
without
danger
to
their
life
attend
their
duty
in
Parliament
,
they
protest
against
the
lawfulness
of
everything
do
in
their
absence
.
 
<EOS>
this
they
ask
the
King
to
send
to
the
House
of
Lords
,
which
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
House
of
Commons
impeach
the
whole
party
of
Bishops
and
send
them
off
to
the
Tower
:
  
<EOS>
take
no
warning
from
this
;
but
encourage
by
there
be
a
moderate
party
in
the
Parliament
who
object
to
these
strong
measure
,
the
King
,
on
the
third
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
two
,
take
the
rash
step
that
ever
be
take
by
mortal
man
.
  
<EOS>
of
his
own
accord
and
without
advice
,
he
send
the
Attorney
-
General
to
the
House
of
Lords
,
to
accuse
of
treason
certain
member
of
Parliament
who
as
popular
leader
be
the
most
obnoxious
to
him
;
LORD
KIMBOLTON
,
SIR
ARTHUR
HASELRIG
,
DENZIL
HOLLIS
,
JOHN
PYM
(
they
use
to
call
him
King
Pym
,
he
possess
such
power
and
look
so
big
)
,
JOHN
HAMPDEN
,
and
WILLIAM
STRODE
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
of
those
member
he
cause
to
be
enter
,
and
their
paper
to
be
seal
up
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
send
a
messenger
to
the
House
of
Commons
demand
to
have
the
five
gentleman
who
be
member
of
that
House
immediately

<EOS>
to
this
the
House
reply
that
they
should
appear
as
soon
as
there
be
any
legal
charge
against
them
,
and
immediately

.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
the
House

Lord
Mayor
know
that
their
privilege
be

by
the
King
,
and
that
there
be
no
safety
for

or
anything
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
five
member

go
out
of
the
way
,
down
come

King

,
with
all

<EOS>
these

and
<EOS>
then
,
with
his
nephew
at
his
side
,
go
into
the
House
,
take
off
his
hat
,
and
walk
up
to
the
Speaker

.
 
<EOS>
the
Speaker
leave
it
,
the
King
stand
in
front
of
it
,
look
about
him
steadily
for
a
little
while
,
and
say
he
have
come

those
five
member
.
<EOS>
no
one
speak
,
and
then
he
call
John
Pym
by

.
 
<EOS>
no
one
speak
,
and
then
he
call
Denzil
Hollis
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
speak
,
and
then
he
ask
the
Speaker
of
the
House
where
those
five
member
be
?
 
<EOS>
the
Speaker
,
answer
on
his
knee
,
nobly
reply
that
he
be
the
servant
of
that
House
,
and
that
he
have
neither
eye
to
see
,
nor
tongue
to
speak
,
anything
but
<EOS>
what
the
House
command
him
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
King
,
beat
from
that
time
evermore
,
reply
that
he
will
seek
them
himself
,
for
they
have
commit
treason
;
and
go
out
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
amid
some
audible
murmur
from
the
member
.
  
<EOS>
no
word
can
describe
the
hurry
that
arise
out
of
door
when
all
this
be
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
five
member
have
go
for
safety
to
a
house
in
Coleman
-
street
,
in
the
City
,
where
they
be
guard
all

;
and
indeed
the
whole
city

in
arm
like
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
in
the

,
the

with
only
half
a
dozen
lord
,
and
make
a
speech
to
the
people
,
hope
they
would
not
shelter
those
whom
he
accuse
of
treason
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
he
issue
a
proclamation
for
the
apprehension
of
the
five
member
;
but
the
Parliament
mind

so
little
that
they
make
great
arrangement
for
have
them
bring
down
to
Westminster
in
great
state
,
five
day
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
so
alarmed
now
at
his
own
imprudence
,
if
not
for
his
own
safety
,
that
he

his
palace
at
Whitehall
,
and
go
away
with
his

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
beyond

come
a
crowd
who
choke

roar
incessantly
about
the
Bishops

the
Papists
,
and
cry
out
contemptuously
as
they
pass
Whitehall
,
"
what
have
become
of
the
King
?
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
great
noise
outside
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
with
great
silence
within
,
Mr
Pym

and
inform
the

great
kindness
with
which

Skippon

the
House

<EOS>
then

come
four
thousand
man

Buckinghamshire
,
offer
their
service
as
a

too
,
and
bear

complaining
of
the
injury
that
have
be
do
to
Mr
Hampden
,
who
be
their
county
man
and
much
beloved
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
King
set
off
for
Hampton
Court
,
the
gentleman
and
soldier
who
have
be
with
him
follow
him
out

<EOS>
this
,
the
Parliament

and
Lord

abroad
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
then
immediately
apply
themselves
to
get
hold
of
the
military
power
of
the
country
,
well
know
that
the

secretly
send
the
Earl
of
Newcastle
to
Hull
,
to
secure
a
valuable
magazine

time
,
every
county
have
its
own
magazine
of
arm
and
powder
,
for
its
own
train

so

the
Parliament
bring
in
a

claim
the
right
(
which
up

to
the
King

OLIVER

raise
a

thoroughly
in

thoroughly
well
armed
---
who
be
,
perhaps
,
the
good

<EOS>
in
some
of
their

this
famous

pass
the
bound
of

yield

and
favour
riotous
assemblage
of
the
people
,
and
act
tyrannically
in
imprison
some
who
differ
from
the
popular
leader
.
 
<EOS>
but
again
,
you
be
always
to
remember
that
the
twelve
year
during
which
the
King
have
have
his
own
wilful
way
,
have
go
before
;
and
that
nothing
could
make
the
time
what
they
may

could

would

if
those

<EOS>
Third
Part
    
<EOS>
I
SHALL
not
try
to
relate
the
particular
of
the
great
civil
war
between
King
Charles
the
first
and
the
Long
Parliament
,
which
last
nearly
four
year
,
and
a
full
account
of
which
would
fill
many
large
book
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
thing
that
Englishmen
should
once
more
be
fight
against
Englishmen
on
english
ground
;
but
,
it
be
some
consolation
to
know
that
on
both
side
there
be
great
humanity
,
forbearance
,
and
honour
.
 
<EOS>
the
soldier
of
the
Parliament
be
far
more
remarkable
for
these
good
quality
than
the
soldier
of
the
King
(
many
of
whom
fight
for
mere
pay
without
much
care
for
the
cause
)
;
but
those
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
who
be
on
the
King
's
side
be
so
brave
,
and
so
faithful
to
him
,
that
their
conduct
can
not
but
command
our
high
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
be
great
number
of
Catholics
,
who
take
the
royal
side
because
the
Queen
be
so
strongly
of
their
persuasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
may
have
distinguish
some
of
these
gallant
spirit
,
if
he
have
be
as
generous
a
spirit
himself
,
by
give
them
the
command
of
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
that
,
however
,
true
to
his
old
high
notion
of
royalty
,
he
entrust
it
to
his
two
nephew
,
PRINCE
RUPERT
and
PRINCE
MAURICE
,
who
be
of
royal
blood
and
come
over
from
abroad
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
well
for
him
if
they
have
stay
away
;
since
Prince
Rupert
be
an
impetuous
,
hot
-
head
fellow
,
whose
only
idea
be
to
dash
into
battle
at
all
time
and
season
,
and
lie
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
general
-
in
-
chief
of
the
Parliamentary
army
be
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
a
gentleman
of
honour
and
an
excellent
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
while
before
the
war
break
out
,
there
have
be
some
rioting
at
Westminster
between
certain
officious
law
student
and
noisy
soldier
,
and
the
shopkeeper
and
their
apprentice
,
and
the
general
people
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
time
the
King
's
friend
call
the
crowd
,
Roundheads
,
because
the
apprentice
wear
short
hair
;
the
crowd
,
in
return
,
call
their
opponent
Cavaliers
,
mean
that
they
be
a
blustering
set
,
who
pretend
to
be
very
military
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
word
now
begin
to
be
use
to
distinguish
the
two
side
in
the
civil
war
.
 
<EOS>
the
Royalists
also
call
the
parliamentary
man
rebel
and
Rogues
,
while
the
parliamentary
man
call
THEM
Malignants
,
and
speak
of
themselves
as
the
Godly
,
the
Honest
,
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
the
war
break
out
at
Portsmouth
,
where
that
double
traitor
Goring
have
again
go
over
to
the
King
and
be
besiege
by
the
parliamentary
troop
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
King
proclaim
the
Earl
of
Essex
and
the
officer
serve
under
him
,
traitor
,
and
call
upon
his
loyal
subject
to
meet
him
in
arm
at
Nottingham
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
August
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
loyal
subject
come
about
him
in
scanty
number
,
and
it
be
a
windy
,
gloomy
day
,
and
the
Royal
Standard
get
blow
down
,
and
the
whole
affair
be
very
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
engagement
after
this
,
take
place
in
the
vale
of
the
Red
Horse
near
Banbury
,
at
Brentford
,
at
Devizes
,
at
Chalgrave
Field
(
where
Mr
Hampden
be
so
sorely
wound
while
fight
at
the
head
of
his
man
,
that
he
die
within
a
week
)
,
at
Newbury
(
in
which
battle
LORD
FALKLAND
,
one
of
the
good
nobleman
on
the
King
's
side
,
be
kill
)
,
at
Leicester
,
at
Naseby
,
at
Winchester
,
at
Marston
Moor
near
York
,
at
Newcastle
,
and
in
many
other
part
of
England
and
Scotland
.
<EOS>
these
battle
be
attend
with
various
success
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
the
King
be
victorious
;
at
another
time
,
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
but
almost
all
the
great
and
busy
town
be
against
the
King
;
and
when
it
be
consider
necessary
to
fortify
London
,
all
rank
of
people
,
from
labour
man
and
woman
,
up
to
lord
and
lady
,
work
hard
together
with
heartiness
and
good
will
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
distinguished
leader
on
the
parliamentary
side
be
HAMPDEN
,
SIR
THOMAS
FAIRFAX
,
and
,
above
all
,
OLIVER
CROMWELL
,
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
IRETON
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
this
war
,
the
people
,
to
whom
it
be
very
expensive
and
irksome
,
and
to
whom
it
be
make
the
more
distressing
by
almost
every
family
be
divide
---
some
of
its
member
attach
themselves
to
one
side
and
some
to
the
other
---
be
over
and
over
again
most
anxious
for
peace
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
some
of
the
good
man
in
each
cause
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
treaty
of
peace
be
discuss
between
commissioner
from
the
Parliament
and
the
King
;
at
York
,
at
Oxford
(
where
the
King
hold
a
little
Parliament
of
his
own
)
,
and
at
Uxbridge
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
come
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
these
negotiation
,
and
in
all
his
difficulty
,
the
King
show
himself
at
his
good
.
<EOS>
He
be
courageous
,
cool
,
self
-
possess
,
and
clever
;
but
,
the
old
taint
of
his
character
be
always
in
him
,
and
he
be
never
for
one
single
moment
to
be
trust
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Clarendon
,
the
historian
,
one
of
his
high
admirer
,
suppose
that
he
have
unhappily
promise
the
Queen
never
to
make
peace
without
her
consent
,
and
that
this
must
often
be
take
as
his
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
keep
his
word
from
night
to
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
sign
a
cessation
of
hostility
with
the
blood
-
stain
irish
rebel
for
a
sum
of
money
,
and
invite
the
irish
regiment
over
,
to
help
him
against
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
battle
of
Naseby
,
his
cabinet
be
seize
and
be
find
to
contain
a
correspondence
with
the
Queen
,
in
which
he
expressly
tell
her
that
he
have
deceive
the
Parliament
---
a
mongrel
Parliament
,
he
call
it
now
,
as
an
improvement
on
his
old
term
of
viper
---
in
pretend
to
recognise
it
and
to
treat
with
it
;
and
from
which
it
further
appear
that
he
have
long
be
in
secret
treaty
with
the
Duke
of
Lorraine
for
a
foreign
army
of
ten
thousand
man
.
 
<EOS>
disappoint
in
this
,
he
send
a
most
devoted
friend
of
his
,
the
EARL
of
GLAMORGAN
,
to
Ireland
,
to
conclude
a
secret
treaty
with
the
catholic
power
,
to
send
him
an
irish
army
of
ten
thousand
man
;
in
return
for
which
he
be
to
bestow
great
favour
on
the
catholic
religion
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
when
this
treaty
be
discover
in
the
carriage
of
a
fight
Irish
Archbishop
who
be
kill
in
one
of
the
many
skirmish
of
those
day
,
he
basely
deny
and
desert
his
attach
friend
,
the
Earl
,
on
his
be
charge
with
high
treason
;
and
---
even
bad
than
this
---
<EOS>
have
leave
blank
in
the
secret
instruction
he
give
him
with
his
own
kingly
hand
,
expressly
that
he
may
thus
save
himself
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
day
of
April
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
six
,
the
King
find
himself
in
the
city
of
Oxford
,
so
surround
by
the
Parliamentary
army
who
be
close
in
upon
him
on
all
side
that
he
feel
that
if
he
would
escape
he
must
delay
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
that
night
,
have
alter
the
cut
of
his
hair
and
beard
,
he
be
dress
up
as
a
servant
and
put
upon
a
horse
with
a
cloak
strap
behind
him
,
and
ride
out
of
the
town
behind
one
of
his
own
faithful
follower
,
with
a
clergyman
of
that
country
who
know
the
road
well
,
for
a
guide
.
 
<EOS>
He
ride
towards
London
as
far
as
Harrow
,
and
then
alter
his
plan
and
resolve
,
it
would
seem
,
to
go
to
the
scottish
camp
.
 
<EOS>
the
scottish
man
have
be
invite
over
to
help
the
Parliamentary
army
,
and
have
a
large
force
then
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
so
desperately
intriguing
in
everything
he
do
,
that
it
be
doubtful
what
he
exactly
mean
by
this
step
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
it
,
anyhow
,
and
deliver
himself
up
to
the
EARL
of
leven
,
the
scottish
general
-
in
-
chief
,
who
treat
him
as
an
honourable
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
negotiation
between
the
Parliament
on
the
one
hand
and
the
scottish
authority
on
the
other
,
as
to
what
should
be
do
with
him
,
last
until
the
follow
February
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
King
have
refuse
to
the
Parliament
the
concession
of
that
old
militia
point
for
twenty
year
,
and
have
refuse
to
scotland
the
recognition
of
its
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
,
Scotland
get
a
handsome
sum
for
its
army
and
its
help
,
and
the
King
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
,
by
certain
parliamentary
commissioner
appoint
to
receive
him
,
to
one
of
his
own
house
,
call
Holmby
House
,
near
Althorpe
,
in
Northamptonshire
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
Civil
War
be
still
in
progress
,
John
Pym
die
,
and
be
bury
with
great
honour
in
Westminster
Abbey
---
not
with
great
honour
than
he
deserve
,
for
the
liberty
of
Englishmen
owe
a
mighty
debt
to
Pym
and
Hampden
.
 
<EOS>
the
war
be
but
newly
over
when
the
Earl
of
Essex
die
,
of
an
illness
bring
on
by
his
have
overheat
himself
in
a
stag
hunt
in
Windsor
Forest
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
be
bury
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
with
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
not
necessary
to
add
that
Archbishop
Laud
die
upon
the
scaffold
when
the
war
be
not
yet
do
.
 
<EOS>
His
trial
last
in
all
nearly
a
year
,
and
,
it
be
doubtful
even
then
whether
the
charge
bring
against
him
amount
to
treason
,
the
odious
old
contrivance
of
the
bad
king
be
resort
to
,
and
a
bill
of
attainder
be
bring
in
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
violently
prejudiced
and
mischievous
person
;
have
have
strong
ear
-
cropping
and
nose
-
split
propensity
,
as
you
know
;
and
have
do
a
world
of
harm
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
die
peaceably
,
and
like
a
brave
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
Fourth
Part
    
when
the
Parliament
have
get
the
king
into
their
hand
,
they
become
very
anxious
to
get
rid
of
their
army
,
in
which
Oliver
Cromwell
have
begin
to
acquire
great
power
;
not
only
because
of
his
courage
and
high
ability
,
but
because
he
profess
to
be
very
sincere
in
the
scottish
sort
of
Puritan
religion
that
be
then
exceedingly
popular
among
the
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
as
much
oppose
to
the
Bishops
as
to
the
Pope
himself
;
and
the
very
private
,
drummer
,
and
trumpeter
,
have
such
an
inconvenient
habit
of
start
up
and
preach
long
-
winded
discourse
,
that
I
would
not
have
belong
to
that
army
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
the
Parliament
,
be
far
from
sure
but
that
the
army
may
begin
to
preach
and
fight
against
them
now
<EOS>
it
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
propose
to
disband
the
great
part
of
it
,
to
send
another
part
to
serve
in
Ireland
against
the
rebel
,
and
to
keep
only
a
small
force
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
army
would
not
consent
to
be
break
up
,
except
upon
its
own
condition
;
and
,
when
the
Parliament
show
an
intention
of
compel
it
,
it
act
for
itself
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
cornet
,
of
the
name
of
JOICE
,
arrive
at
Holmby
House
one
night
,
attend
by
four
hundred
horseman
,
go
into
the
King
's
room
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
pistol
in
the
other
,
and
tell
the
King
that
he
have
come
to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
willing
enough
to
go
,
and
only
stipulate
that
he
should
be
publicly
require
to
do
so
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
,
accordingly
,
he
appear
on
the
top
of
the
step
of
the
house
,
and
ask
Comet
Joice
before
his
man
and
the
guard
set
there
by
the
Parliament
,
what
authority
he
have
for
take
him
away
?
 
<EOS>
to
this
Cornet
Joice
reply
,
"
the
authority
of
the
army
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
a
write
commission
?
"
say
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
Joice
,
point
to
his
four
hundred
man
on
horseback
,
reply
,
"
that
be
my
commission
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
King
,
smile
,
as
if
he
be
pleased
,
"
I
never
before
read
such
a
commission
;
but
it
be
write
in
fair
and
legible
character
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
company
of
as
handsome
proper
gentleman
as
I
have
see
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
ask
where
he
would
like
to
live
,
and
he
say
at
Newmarket
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
to
Newmarket
he
and
Cornet
Joice
and
the
four
hundred
horseman
ride
;
the
King
remarking
,
in
the
same
smiling
way
,
that
he
could
ride
as
far
at
a
spell
as
Cornet
Joice
,
or
any
man
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
quite
believe
,
I
think
,
that
the
army
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
say
as
much
to
Fairfax
when
that
general
,
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
Ireton
,
go
to
persuade
him
to
return
to
the
custody
of
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
He
prefer
to
remain
as
he
be
,
and
resolve
to
remain
as
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
the
army
move
nearer
and
near
London
to
frighten
the
Parliament
into
yield
to
their
demand
,
they
take
the
king
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
deplorable
thing
that
England
should
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
great
body
of
soldier
with
arm
in
their
hand
;
but
the
King
certainly
favour
them
at
this
important
time
of
his
life
,
as
compare
with
the
more
lawful
power
that
try
to
control
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
add
,
however
,
that
they
treat
him
,
as
yet
,
more
respectfully
and
kindly
than
the
Parliament
have
do
.
<EOS>
They
allow
him
to
be
attend
by
his
own
servant
,
to
be
splendidly
entertain
at
various
house
,
and
to
see
his
child
---
at
Cavesham
House
,
near
Reading
---
for
two
day
.
 
<EOS>
whereas
,
the
Parliament
have
be
rather
hard
with
him
,
and
have
only
allow
him
to
ride
out
and
play
at
bowl
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
much
to
be
believe
that
if
the
King
could
have
be
trust
,
even
at
this
time
,
he
may
have
be
save
.
 
<EOS>
even
Oliver
Cromwell
expressly
say
that
he
do
believe
that
no
man
could
enjoy
his
possession
in
peace
,
unless
the
King
have
his
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
unfriendly
towards
the
king
;
he
have
be
present
when
he
receive
his
child
,
and
have
be
much
affect
by
the
pitiable
nature
of
the
scene
;
he
see
the
King
often
;
he
frequently
walk
and
talk
with
him
in
the
long
gallery
and
pleasant
garden
of
the
Palace
at
Hampton
Court
,
whither
he
be
now
remove
;
and
in
all
this
risk
something
of
his
influence
with
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
King
be
in
secret
hope
of
help
from
the
scottish
people
;
and
the
moment
he
be
encourage
to
join
them
he
begin
to
be
cool
to
his
new
friend
,
the
army
,
and
to
tell
the
officer
that
they
could
not
possibly
do
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
very
time
,
too
,
when
he
be
promise
to
make
Cromwell
and
Ireton
nobleman
,
if
they
would
help
him
up
to
his
old
height
,
he
be
write
to
the
Queen
that
he
mean
to
hang
them
.
<EOS>
They
both
afterwards
declare
that
they
have
be
privately
inform
that
such
a
letter
would
be
find
,
on
a
certain
evening
,
sew
up
in
a
saddle
which
would
be
take
to
the
Blue
Boar
in
Holborn
to
be
send
to
Dover
;
and
that
they
go
there
,
disguise
as
common
soldier
,
and
sit
drink
in
the
inn
-
yard
until
a
man
come
with
the
saddle
,
which
they
rip
up
with
their
knife
,
and
therein
find
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
little
reason
to
doubt
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
Oliver
Cromwell
tell
one
of
the
King
's
most
faithful
follower
that
the
King
could
not
be
trust
,
and
that
he
would
not
be
answerable
if
anything
amiss
be
to
happen
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
even
after
that
,
he
keep
a
promise
he
have
make
to
the
King
,
by
let
him
know
that
there
be
a
plot
with
a
certain
portion
of
the
army
to
seize
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
,
in
fact
,
he
sincerely
want
the
King
to
escape
abroad
,
and
so
to
be
get
rid
of
without
more
trouble
or
danger
.
 
<EOS>
that
Oliver
himself
have
work
enough
with
the
army
<EOS>
be
pretty
plain
;
for
some
of
the
troop
be
so
mutinous
against
him
,
and
against
those
who
act
with
him
at
this
time
,
that
he
find
it
necessary
to
have
one
man
shoot
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
to
overawe
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
,
when
he
receive
Oliver
's
warning
,
make
his
escape
from
Hampton
Court
;
after
some
indecision
and
uncertainty
,
he
go
to
Carisbrooke
Castle
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
be
pretty
free
there
;
but
,
even
there
,
he
carry
on
a
pretended
treaty
with
the
Parliament
,
while
he
be
really
treat
with
commissioner
from
Scotland
to
send
an
army
into
England
to
take
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
break
off
this
treaty
with
the
Parliament
(
have
settle
with
Scotland
)
and
be
treat
as
a
prisoner
,
his
treatment
be
not
change
too
soon
,
for
he
have
plot
to
escape
that
very
night
to
a
ship
send
by
the
Queen
,
which
be
lie
off
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
doom
to
be
disappoint
in
his
hope
from
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
the
agreement
he
have
make
with
the
Scottish
Commissioners
be
not
favourable
enough
to
the
religion
of
that
country
to
please
the
scottish
clergy
;
and
they
preach
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
the
army
raise
in
Scotland
and
send
over
,
be
too
small
to
do
much
;
and
that
,
although
it
be
help
by
a
rise
of
the
Royalists
in
England
and
by
good
soldier
from
Ireland
,
it
could
make
no
head
against
the
Parliamentary
army
under
such
man
as
Cromwell
and
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
eld
son
,
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
come
over
from
Holland
with
nineteen
ship
(
a
part
of
the
english
fleet
have
go
over
to
him
)
to
help
his
father
;
but
nothing
come
of
his
voyage
,
and
he
be
fain
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
remarkable
event
of
this
second
civil
war
be
the
cruel
execution
by
the
Parliamentary
General
,
of
SIR
CHARLES
LUCAS
and
SIR
GEORGE
LISLE
,
two
grand
Royalist
general
,
who
have
bravely
defend
Colchester
under
every
disadvantage
of
famine
and
distress
for
nearly
three
month
.
 
<EOS>
when
Sir
Charles
Lucas
be
shoot
,
Sir
George
Lisle
kiss
his
body
,
and
say
to
the
soldier
who
be
to
shoot
him
,
"
come
nearer
,
and
make
sure
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
warrant
you
,
Sir
George
,
"
say
one
of
the
soldier
,
"
we
shall
hit
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
?
<EOS>
"
he
return
with
a
smile
,
"
but
I
have
be
near
to
you
,
my
friend
,
many
a
time
,
and
you
have
miss
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Parliament
,
after
be
fearfully
bully
by
the
army
---
who
demand
to
have
seven
member
whom
they
dislike
give
up
to
them
---
have
vote
that
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
King
.
<EOS>
on
the
conclusion
,
however
,
of
this
second
civil
war
(
which
do
not
last
more
than
six
month
)
,
they
appoint
commissioner
to
treat
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
then
so
far
release
again
as
to
be
allow
to
live
in
a
private
house
at
Newport
in
the
Isle
of
Wight

manage
his

part
of
the
negotiation
with
a
sense
that

admire
by

him

and
give
up
,
in
the
end

all
that

ask
of
him

even
yielding
(
which
he
have
steadily
refuse

so
far
)
to
the
temporary
abolition
of
the
bishop
,
and
the
transfer
of
their
church
land
to
the
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
with
his
old
fatal
vice
upon
him
,
when
his
good
friend
join
the
commissioner
in
beseech
him
to
yield
all
those
point
as
the
only
mean
of
save
himself
from
the
army
,
he
be

he

and
he

,
with
his
own
hand
,
that
in
what
he
yield
he
mean
nothing
but
to
get
time
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
matter
be
at
this
pass
when
the
army
,
resolve
to
defy
the
Parliament
,
march
up
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
,
not
afraid
of
them
now
,
and
boldly
lead
by
Hollis
,
vote
that
the
King
's
concession
be
sufficient
ground
for
settle
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
COLONEL
RICH

COLONEL
PRIDE

with

<EOS>
this
proceeding
be
afterwards

Cromwell

of
his

stick
have
fall
off
while
he
lean
upon
it
,
at
one
time
of
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
the
accident
seem
to
disturb
him
,
as
if
he
think
it
ominous
of
the
falling
of
his
own

It

<EOS>
I

the
unhappy
King

whom
you

I

spare
;
but
they

<EOS>
the
Scottish
Commissioners

too
;
so
do
the
Prince

Wales

letter
in
which
he

notwithstanding

there

and
mark
it
with
ink
.
 
<EOS>
that
commissioner
have
not
sign
his
own

yet
,
and
the
story
add
that
when
he
come
to
do
it
he
mark
Cromwell

face
with
ink
in
the
same
way

<EOS>
the

two
hour
before

<EOS>
He

two
shirt
lest
he

<EOS>
the

be
direct

three
officer
of
the

,
COLONEL
HACKER
,
COLONEL
HUNKS

and
COLONEL
PHAYER

<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
,
the
first
of
these
come
to
the
door
and
say
it
be
time
to
go
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
,
who
have
always
be
a
quick
walker
,
walk
at
his
usual
speed
through
the
Park
,
and
call
out
to
the
guard
,
with
his
accustomed
voice
of
command
,
"
March
on
apace
!
"
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
Whitehall
,
he
be
take
to
his
own
bedroom
,
where
a
breakfast
be
set
forth
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
take
the
sacrament
,
he
would
eat
nothing
more
;
but
,
at
about
the
time
when
the
church
bell
strike
twelve
at
noon
(
for
he
have
to
wait
,
through
the
scaffold
not
be
ready
)
,
he
take
the
advice
of
the
good
BISHOP
JUXON
who
be
with
him
,
and
eat
a
little
bread
and
drank
a
glass
of
claret
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
he
have
take
this
refreshment
,
Colonel
Hacker
come
to
the
chamber
with
the
warrant
in
his
hand
,
and
call
for
Charles
Stuart
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
through
the
long
gallery
of
Whitehall
Palace
,
which
he
have
often
see
light
and
gay
and
merry
and
crowd
,
in
very
different
time
,
the
fall
King
pass
along
,
until
he
come
to
the
centre
window
of
the
Banqueting
House
,
through
which
he
emerge
upon
the
scaffold
,
which
be
hang
with
black
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
two
executioner
,
who
be
dress
in
black
and
masked
;
he
look
at
the
troop
of
soldier
on
horseback
and
on
foot
,
and
all
look
up
at
him
in
silence
;
he
look
at
the
vast
array
of
spectator
,
fill
up
the
view
beyond
,
and
turn
all
their
face
upon
him
;
he
look
at
his
old
Palace
of
St
James
's
;
and
he
look
at
the
block
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
a
little
troubled
to
find
that
it
be
so
low
,
and
ask
,
"
if
there
be
no
place
high
?
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
to
those
upon
the
scaffold
,
he
say
,
"
that
it
be
the
Parliament
who
have
begin
the
war
,
and
not
he
;
but
he
hope
they
may
be
guiltless
too
,
as
ill
instrument
have
go
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
"
he
say
,
"
he
suffer
justly
;
and
that
be
because
he
have
permit
an
unjust
sentence
to
be
execute
on
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
this
he
refer
to
the
Earl
of
Strafford
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
afraid
to
die
;
but
he
be
anxious
to
die
easily
.
<EOS>
when
some
one
touch
the
axe
while
he
be
speak
,
he
break
off
and
call
out
,
"
<EOS>
take
heed
of
the
axe
!
<EOS>
take
heed
of
the
axe
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
also
say
to
Colonel
Hacker
,
"
take
care
that
they
do
not
put
me
to
pain
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
tell
the
executioner
,
"
I
shall
say
but
very
short
prayer
,
and
then
thrust
out
my
hand
"
---
as
the
sign
to
strike
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
hair
up
,
under
a
white
satin
cap
which
the
bishop
have
carry
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
a
good
cause
and
a
gracious
God
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
bishop
tell
him
that
he
have
but
one
stage
more
to
travel
in
this
weary
world
,
and
that
,
though
it
be
a
turbulent
and
troublesome
stage
,
it
be
a
short
one
,
and
would
carry
him
a
great
way
---
all
the
way
from
earth
to
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
last
word
,
as
he
give
his
cloak
and
the
George
---
the
decoration
from
his
breast
---
to
the
bishop
,
be
,
"
remember
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
kneel
down
,
lay
his
head
on
the
block
,
spread
out
his
hand
,
and
be
instantly
kill
.
<EOS>
one
universal
groan
break
from
the
crowd
;
and
the
soldier
,
who
have
sit
on
their
horse
and
stand
in
their
rank
immovable
as
statue
,
be
of
a
sudden
all
in
motion
,
clear
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
in
the
forty
-
ninth
year
of
his
age
,
fall
at
the
same
time
of
his
career
as
Strafford
have
fall
in
his
,
perish
Charles
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
my
sorrow
for
him
,
I
can
not
agree
with
him
that
he
die
"
the
martyr
of
the
people
;
"
for
the
people
have
be
martyr
to
him
,
and
to
his
idea
of
a
King
's
right
,
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
afraid
that
he
be
but
a
bad
judge
of
martyr
;
for
he
have
call
that
infamous
Duke
of
Buckingham
"
the
Martyr
of
his
Sovereign

"
    
<EOS>
England
under
Oliver

<EOS>
soon
afterwards
,
it
declare
that
the

ought

(
all

they
then
appoint
a
Council

<EOS>
It
consist

make
up
its

but
,
it
still
have
an
army
of
more
than
forty
thousand
man
to
deal
with
,
and
a
very
hard
task
it
be
to
manage

<EOS>
before
the
King
's
execution
,
the
army
have
appoint
some
of
its
officer
to
remonstrate
between
them
and
the
Parliament
;
and
now
the
common
soldier
begin
to
take
that
office
upon
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
regiment

order
for
Ireland
mutiny
;
one
troop
of
horse
in
the
city
of
London
seize
their

<EOS>
for

the

be
shoot

which
do
not

both
his

make
a

grave
with
sound
of
trumpet
and
with
a
gloomy
procession
of

carry
bundle

rosemary
steep

<EOS>
Oliver
be
the
only
man
to
deal
with
such
difficulty
as
these
,
and
he
soon
cut
them
short
by
burst
at
midnight
into
the
town
of
Burford
,
near
Salisbury
,
where
the
mutineer
be
shelter
,
take
four
hundred
of
them
prisoner
,
and
shoot
a
number
of
them
by
sentence
of
court

martial

<EOS>
the
soldier
soon
find
,
as
all
man
do
,
that
Oliver
be
not
a
man
to
be
trifle
with
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
an
end
of
the
mutiny
.
  
<EOS>
the
Scottish
Parliament
do
not
know
Oliver
yet
;
so
,
on
hearing
of
the
King

execution
,
it
proclaim
the
Prince
of
Wales
King
Charles
the
second
,
on
condition

Solemn
League

<EOS>
Charles
be
abroad
at
that
time
,
and
so
be
Montrose
,
from
whose
help
he
have
hope
enough
to
keep
him
hold
on
and
off
with
commissioner
from
Scotland
,
just
as
his
father
may
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
these
hope
be
soon
at
an
end
;
for
,
Montrose
,
have
raise
a
few
hundred
exile
in
Germany
,
and
land
with
them
in
Scotland
,
find
that
the
people
there
,
instead
of
join
him
,
desert
the
country
at
his
approach

<EOS>
He
be
soon
take
prisoner

carry
to
Edinburgh

<EOS>
there
he

possible
insult

his
officer
go
two

<EOS>
He
be
sentence
by
the
Parliament
to
be
hang
on
a
gallow
thirty
foot
high
,
to
have
his
head
set
on
a
spike
in
Edinburgh
,
and
his
limb
distribute
in
other
place
,
accord
to
the
old
barbarous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
always
act
under
the
royal
order
,
and
only
wish
he
have
limb
enough
to
be
distribute
through
Christendom
,
that
it
may
be
the
more
widely
know
how
loyal
he
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
scaffold
in
a
bright
and
brilliant
dress
,
and
make
a
bold
end
at
thirty
-
eight
year
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
the
breath
be
scarcely
out
of
his
body
when
Charles
abandon
his
memory
,
and
deny
that
he
have
ever
give
him
order
to
rise
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
o
the
family
fail
be
strong
in
that
Charles
then
!
  
<EOS>
Oliver
have
be
appoint
by
the
Parliament
to
command
the
army
in
Ireland
,
where
he
take
a
terrible
vengeance
for
the
sanguinary
rebellion
,
and
make
tremendous
havoc
,
particularly
in
the
siege
of
Drogheda
,
where
no
quarter
be
give
,
and
where
he
find
at
least
a
thousand
of
the
inhabitant
shut
up
together
in
the
great
church
:
every
one
of
whom
be
kill
by
his
soldier
,
usually
know
as
OLIVER
's
IRONSIDES
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
number
of
friar
and
priest
among
them
,
and
Oliver
gruffly
write
home
in
his
despatch
that
these
be
"
knock
on
the
head
"
like
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
Charles
have
get
over
to
Scotland
where
the
man
of
the
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
lead
him
a
prodigiously
dull
life
and
make
him
very
weary
with
long
sermon
and
grim
Sundays
,
the
Parliament
call
the
redoubtable
Oliver
home
to
knock
the
scottish
man
on
the
head
for
set
up
that
Prince
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
leave
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
Ireton
,
as
general
in
Ireland
in
his
stead
(
he
die
there
afterwards
)
,
and
he
imitate
the
example
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
with
such
good
will
that
he
bring
the
country
to
subjection
,
and
lay
it
at
the
foot
of
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
end
,
they
pass
an
act
for
the
settlement
of
Ireland
,
generally
pardon
all
the
common
people
,
but
exempt
from
this
grace
such
of
the
wealthy
sort
as
have
be
concern
in
the
rebellion
,
or
in
any
killing
of
Protestants
,
or
who
refuse
to
lay
down
their
arm
.
 
<EOS>
great
number
of
Irish
be
get
out
of
the
country
to
serve
under
catholic
power
abroad
,
and
a
quantity
of
land
be
declare
to
have
be
forfeit
by
past
offence
,
and
be
give
to
people
who
have
lend
money
to
the
Parliament
early
in
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
sweeping
measure
;
but
,
if
Oliver
Cromwell
have
have
his
own
way
fully
,
and
have
stay
in
Ireland
,
he
would
have
do
more
yet
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
say
,
the
Parliament
want
Oliver
for
Scotland
;
so
,
home
Oliver
come
,
and
be
make
Commander
of
all
the
Forces
of
the
Commonwealth
of
England
,
and
in
three
day
away
he
go
with
sixteen
thousand
soldier
to
fight
the
scottish
man
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
scottish
man
,
be
then
---
as
you
will
generally
find
them
now
---
mighty
cautious
,
reflect
that
the
troop
they
have
be
not
use
to
war
like
the
ironside
,
and
would
be
beat
in
an
open
fight
.
<EOS>
therefore
they
say
,
"
if
we
live
quiet
in
our
trench
in
Edinburgh
here
,
and
if
all
the
farmer
come
into
the
town
and
desert
the
country
,
the
ironside
will
be
drive
out
by
iron
hunger
and
be
force
to
go
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
no
doubt
,
the
wise
plan
;
but
as
the
scottish
clergy
WOULD
interfere
with
what
they
know
nothing
about
,
and
would
perpetually
preach
long
sermon
exhort
the
soldier
to
come
out
and
fight
,
the
soldier
get
it
in
their
head
that
they
absolutely
must
come
out
and
fight
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
in
an
evil
hour
for
themselves
,
they
come
out
of
their
safe
position
.
<EOS>
Oliver
fall
upon
them
instantly
,
and
kill
three
thousand
,
and
take
ten
thousand
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
to
gratify
the
Scottish
Parliament
,
and
preserve
their
favour
,
Charles
have
sign
a
declaration
they
lay
before
him
,
reproach
the
memory
of
his
father
and
mother
,
and
represent
himself
as
a
most
religious
Prince
,
to
whom
the
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
be
as
dear
as
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
mean
no
sort
of
truth
in
this
,
and
soon
afterwards
gallop
away
on
horseback
to
join
some
tiresome
Highland
friend
,
who
be
always
flourish
dirk
and
broadsword
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
overtaken
and
induce
to
return
;
but
this
attempt
,
which
be
call
"
the
Start
,
"
do
him
just
so
much
service
,
that
they
do
not
preach
quite
such
long
sermon
at
him
afterwards
as
they
have
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
first
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
one
,
the
scottish
people
crown
him
at
Scone
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
take
the
chief
command
of
an
army
of
twenty
thousand
man
,
and
march
to
Stirling
.
 
<EOS>
His
hope
be
heighten
,
I
dare
say
,
by
the
redoubtable
Oliver
be
ill
of
an
ague
;
but
Oliver
scramble
out
of
bed
in
no
time
,
and
go
to
work
with
such
energy
that
he
get
behind
the
Royalist
army
and
cut
it
off
from
all
communication
with
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
for
it
then
,
but
to
go
on
to
England
;
so
it
go
on
as
far
as
Worcester
,
where
the
mayor
and
some
of
the
gentry
proclaim
King
Charles
the
second
straightway
.
 
<EOS>
His
proclamation
,
however
,
be
of
little
use
to
him
,
for
very
few
Royalists
appear
;
and
,
on
the
very
same
day
,
two
people
be
publicly
behead
on
Tower
Hill
for
espouse
his
cause
.
 
<EOS>
up
come
Oliver
to
Worcester
too
,
at
double
quick
speed
,
and
he
and
his
ironside
so
lay
about
them
in
the
great
battle
which
be
fight
there
,
that
they
completely
beat
the
scottish
man
,
and
destroy
the
Royalist
army
;
though
the
scottish
man
fight
so
gallantly
that
it
take
five
hour
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
escape
of
Charles
after
this
battle
of
Worcester
do
him
good
service
long
afterwards
,
for
it
induce
many
of
the
generous
english
people
to
take
a
romantic
interest
in
him
,
and
to
think
much
well
of
him
than
he
ever
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
He
flee
in
the
night
,
with
not
more
than
sixty
follower
,
to
the
house
of
a
catholic
lady
in
Staffordshire
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
for
his
great
safety
,
the
whole
sixty
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
crop
his
hair
,
stain
his
face
and
hand
brown
as
if
they
be
sunburnt
,
put
on
the
clothe
of
a
labour
countryman
,
and
go
out
in
the
morning
with
his
axe
in
his
hand
,
accompany
by
four
wood
-
cutter
who
be
brother
,
and
another
man
who
be
their
brother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
these
good
fellow
make
a
bed
for
him
under
a
tree
,
as
the
weather
be
very
bad
;
and
the
wife
of
one
of
them
bring
him
food
to
eat
;
and
the
old
mother
of
the
four
brother
come
and
fall
down
on
her
knee
before
him
in
the
wood
,
and
thank
God
that
her
son
be
engage
in
save
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
,
he
come
out
of
the
forest
and
go
on
to
another
house
which
be
near
the
river
Severn
,
with
the
intention
of
pass
into
Wales
;
but
the
place
swarm
with
soldier
,
and
the
bridge
be
guard
,
and
all
the
boat
be
make
fast
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
after
lie
in
a
hayloft
cover
over
with
hay
,
for
some
time
,
he
come
out
of
his
place
,
attend
by
COLONEL
CARELESS
,
a
catholic
gentleman
who
have
meet
him
there
,
and
with
whom
he
lie
hide
,
all
next
day
,
up
in
the
shady
branch
of
a
fine
old
oak
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
lucky
for
the
king
that
it
be
September
-
time
,
and
that
the
leave
have
not
begin
to
fall
,
since
he
and
the
Colonel
,
perch
up
in
this
tree
,
could
catch
glimpse
of
the
soldier
ride
about
below
,
and
could
hear
the
crash
in
the
wood
as
they
go
about
beat
the
bough
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
walk
and
walk
until
his
foot
be
all
blister
;
and
,
have
be
conceal
all
one
day
in
a
house
which
be
search
by
the
trooper
while
he
be
there
,
go
with
LORD
WILMOT
,
another
of
his
good
friend
,
to
a
place
call
Bentley
,
where
one
MISS
LANE
,
a
Protestant
lady
,
have
obtain
a
pass
to
be
allow
to
ride
through
the
guard
to
see
a
relation
of
her
near
Bristol
.
<EOS>
disguise
as
a
servant
,
he
ride
in
the
saddle
before
this
young
lady
to
the
house
of
SIR
JOHN
WINTER
,
while
Lord
Wilmot
ride
there
boldly
,
like
a
plain
country
gentleman
,
with
dog
at
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
Sir
John
Winter
's
butler
have
be
servant
in
Richmond
Palace
,
and
know
Charles
the
moment
he
set
eye
upon
him
;
but
,
the
butler
be
faithful
and
keep
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
ship
could
be
find
to
carry
him
abroad
,
it
be
plan
that
he
should
go
---
still
travel
with
Miss
Lane
as
her
servant
---
to
another
house
,
at
trent
near
Sherborne
in
Dorsetshire
;
and
then
Miss
Lane
and
her
cousin
,
MR
.
<EOS>
LASCELLES
,
who
have
go
on
horseback
beside
her
all
the
way
,
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Miss
Lane
be
go
to
marry
that
cousin
,
for
I
be
sure
she
must
have
be
a
brave
,
kind
girl
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
that
cousin
,
I
should
certainly
have
love
Miss
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
when
Charles
,
lonely
for
the
loss
of
Miss
Lane
,
be
safe
at
Trent
,
a
ship
be
hire
at
Lyme
,
the
master
of
which
engage
to
take
two
gentleman
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
,
the
King
---
now
ride
as
servant
before
another
young
lady
---
set
off
for
a
public
-
house
at
a
place
call
Charmouth
,
where
the
captain
of
the
vessel
be
to
take
him
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
captain
's
wife
,
be
afraid
of
her
husband
get
into
trouble
,
lock
him
up
and
would
not
let
him
sail
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
go
away
to
Bridport
;
and
,
come
to
the
inn
there
,
find
the
stable
-
yard
full
of
soldier
who
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
Charles
,
and
who
talk
about
him
while
they
drink
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
such
presence
of
mind
,
that
he
lead
the
horse
of
his
party
through
the
yard
as
any
other
servant
may
have
do
,
and
say
,
"
come
out
of
the
way
,
you
soldier
<EOS>
;
let
us
have
room
to
pass
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
go
along
,
he
meet
a
half
-
tipsy
ostler
,
who
rub
his
eye
and
say
to
him
,
"
why
,
I
be
formerly
servant
to
Mr
Potter
at
Exeter
,
and
surely
I
have
sometimes
see
you
there
,
young
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
,
for
Charles
have
lodge
there
.
 
<EOS>
His
ready
answer
be
,
"
ah
,
I
do
live
with
him
once
;
but
I
have
no
time
to
talk
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
have
a
pot
of
beer
together
when
I
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
this
dangerous
place
he
return
to
Trent
,
and
lie
there
conceal
several
day
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
escape
to
Heale
,
near
Salisbury
;
where
,
in
the
house
of
a
widow
lady
,
he
be
hide
five
day
,
until
the
master
of
a
collier
lie
off
Shoreham
in
Sussex
,
undertake
to
convey
a
"
gentleman
"
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
night
of
the
fifteenth
of
October
,
accompany
by
two
colonel
and
a
merchant
,
the
King
ride
to
Brighton
,
<EOS>
then
a
little
fishing
village
,
to
give
the
captain
of
the
ship
a
supper
before
go
on
board
;
but
,
so
many
people
know
him
,
that
this
captain
know
him
too
,
and
not
only
he
,
but
the
landlord
and
landlady
also
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
go
away
,
the
landlord
come
behind
his
chair
,
kiss
his
hand
,
and
say
he
hope
to
live
to
be
a
lord
and
to
see
his
wife
a
lady
;
at
which
Charles
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
have
a
good
supper
by
this
time
,
and
plenty
of
smoking
and
drinking
,
at
which
the
King
be
a
first
-
rate
hand
;
so
,
the
captain
assure
him
that
he
would
stand
by
him
,
and
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
the
captain
should
pretend
to
sail
to
Deal
,
and
that
Charles
should
address
the
sailor
and
say
he
be
a
gentleman
in
debt
who
be
run
away
from
his
creditor
,
and
that
he
hope
they
would
join
him
in
persuade
the
captain
to
put
him
ashore
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
King
act
his
part
very
well
indeed
,
and
give
the
sailor
twenty
shilling
to
drink
,
they
beg
the
captain
to
do
what
such
a
worthy
gentleman
ask
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
yield
to
their
entreaty
,
and
the
King
get
safe
to
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
Ireland
be
now
subdue
,
and
Scotland
keep
quiet
by
plenty
of
fort
and
soldier
put
there
by
Oliver
,
the
Parliament
would
have
go
on
quietly
enough
,
as
far
as
fight
with
any
foreign
enemy
go
,
but
for
get
into
trouble
with
the
Dutch
,
who
in
the
spring
of
the
year

thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty

a
fleet
into
the

upon
the
bold
English
ADMIRAL
BLAKE
(
who
be
there
with
half
as
many
ship
as
the
Dutch
)
to
strike
his
flag
.
 
<EOS>
Blake
fire
a
raging
broadside
instead
,
and
beat
off
Van
Tromp
;
who
,
in
the
autumn
,
come
back
again
with
seventy
ship
,
and
challenge
the
bold
Blake
---
who
still
be
only
half
as
strong
---
to
fight
him
.
 
<EOS>
Blake
fight
him
all
day
;
but
,
find
that
the
Dutch
be
too
many
for
him
,
get
quietly
off
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
Van
Tromp
upon
this
,
but
go
cruise
and
boast
about
the
Channel
,
between
the
North
Foreland
and
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
with
a
great
dutch
broom
tie
to
his
masthead
,
as
a
sign
that
he
could
and
would
sweep
the
English
of
the
sea
!
 
<EOS>
within
three
month
,
Blake
lower
his
tone
though
,
and
his
broom
too
;
for
,
he
and
two
other
bold
commander

DEAN
and
MONK
,
fight
him
three
whole
day
,
take
twenty
-
three
of
his
ship
,
shiver
his
broom
to
piece
,
and
settle
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
thing
be
no
sooner
quiet
again
,
than
the
army
begin
to
complain
to
the
Parliament
that
they
be
not
govern
the
nation
properly
,
and
to
hint
that
they
think
they
could
do
it
better
themselves
.
<EOS>
Oliver
,
who
have
now
make
up
his
mind
to
be
the
head
of
the
state
,
or
nothing

<EOS>
"

and
that

and
tell

<EOS>
They

State
after
this
extraordinary
proceeding

and
get
a
new
Parliament
together
in
their
own
way
:
which
Oliver

in
a
sort
of
sermon

and
which
he

Second

---
whom
the
people
long
call
OLD

in
accept
the
office
of
Protector
,
have
bind
himself
by
a
certain
paper
which
be
hand
to
him
,
call
"
the
Instrument
,
"
to
summon
a
Parliament
,
consist
of
between
four
and
five
hundred
member
,
in
the
election
of
which
neither
the
Royalists
nor
the
Catholics
be
to
have
any
share
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
also
pledge
himself
that
this
Parliament
should
not
be
dissolve
without
its
own
consent
until
it
have
sit
five
month
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
Parliament
meet
,
Oliver
make
a
speech
to
them
of
three
hour
long
,
very
wisely
advise
them
what
to
do
for
the
credit
and
happiness
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
to
keep
down
the
more
violent
member
,
he
require
them
to
sign
a
recognition
of
what
they
be
forbid
by
"
the
Instrument
"
to
do
;
which
be
,
chiefly
,
to
take
the
power
from
one
single
person
at
the
head
of
the
state
or
to
command
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
dismiss
them
to
go
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
with
his
usual
vigour
and
resolution
he
go
to
work
himself
with
some
frantic
preacher
---
who
be
rather
overdo
their
sermon
in
call
him
a
villain
and
a
tyrant
---
by
shut
up
their
chapel
,
and
send
a
few
of
them
off
to
prison
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
at
that
time
,
in
England
or
anywhere
else
,
a
man
so
able
to
govern
the
country
as
Oliver
Cromwell
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
rule
with
a
strong
hand
,
and
levy
a
very
heavy
tax
on
the
Royalists
(
but
not
until
they
have
plot
against
his
life
)
,
he
rule
wisely
,
and
as
the
time
require
.
 
<EOS>
He
cause
England
to
be
so
respected
abroad
,
that
I
wish
some
lord
and
gentleman
who
have
govern
it
under
king
and
queen
in
later
day
would
have
take
a
leaf
out
of
Oliver
Cromwell
's
book
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
bold
Admiral
Blake
to
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
to
make
the
Duke
of
Tuscany
pay
sixty
thousand
pound
for
injury
he
have
do
to
british
subject
,
and
spoliation
he
have
commit
on
english
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
despatch
him
and
his
fleet
to
Algiers
,
Tunis
,
and
Tripoli
,
to
have
every
english
ship
and
every
english
man
deliver
up
to
him
that
have
be
take
by
pirate
in
those
part
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
gloriously
do
;
and
it
begin
to
be
thoroughly
well
know
,
all
over
the
world
,
that
England
be
govern
by
a
man
in
earnest
,
who
would
not
allow
the
english
name
to
be
insult
or
slight
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
not
all
his
foreign
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
a
fleet
to
sea
against
the
Dutch
;
and
the
two
power
,
each
with
one
hundred
ship
upon
its
side
,
meet
in
the
English
Channel
off
the
North
Foreland
,
where
the
fight
last
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
Dean
be
kill
in
this
fight
;
but
Monk
,
who
command
in
the
same
ship
with
him
,
throw
his
cloak
over
his
body
,
that
the
sailor
may
not
know
of
his
death
,
and
be
dishearten
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
they
.
 
<EOS>
the
english
broadside
so
exceedingly
astonish
the
Dutch
that
they
sheer
off
at
last
,
though
the
redoubtable
Van
Tromp
fire
upon
them
with
his
own
gun
for
desert
their
flag
.
 
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
,
the
two
fleet
engage
again
,
off
the
coast
of
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
the
valiant
Van
Tromp
be
shoot
through
the
heart
,
and
the
Dutch
give
in
,
and
peace
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
further
than
this
,
Oliver
resolve
not
to
bear
the
domineering
and
bigoted
conduct
of
Spain
,
which
country
not
only
claim
a
right
to
all
the
gold
and
silver
that
could
be
find
in
South
America
,
and
treat
the
ship
of
all
other
country
who
visit
those
region
,
as
pirate
,
but
put
english
subject
into
the
horrible
spanish
prison
of
the
Inquisition
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
Oliver
tell
the
spanish
ambassador
that
english
ship
must
be
free
to
go
wherever
they
would
,
and
that
english
merchant
must
not
be
throw
into
those
same
dungeon
,
no
,
not
for
the
pleasure
of
all
the
priest
in
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
the
spanish
ambassador
reply
that
the
gold
and
silver
country
,
and
the
Holy
Inquisition
,
be
his
King
's
two
eye
,
neither
of
which
he
could
submit
to
have
put
out
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
,
say
Oliver
,
then
he
be
afraid
he
(
Oliver
)
must
damage
those
two
eye
directly
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
another
fleet
be
despatch
under
two
commander
,
PENN
and
venables
,
for
Hispaniola
;
where
,
however
,
the
Spaniards
get
the
well
of
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
the
fleet
come
home
again
,
after
take
Jamaica
on
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
indignant
with
the
two
commander
who
have
not
do
what
bold
Admiral
Blake
would
have
do
,
clap
them
both
into
prison
,
declare
war
against
Spain
,
and
make
a
treaty
with
France
,
in
virtue
of
which
it
be
to
shelter
the
King
and
his
brother
the
Duke
of
York
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
send
a
fleet
abroad
under
bold
Admiral
Blake
,
which
bring
the
King
of
Portugal
to
his
sense
---
just
to
keep
its
hand
in
---
and
then
engage
a
spanish
fleet
,
sink
four
great
ship
,
and
take
two
more
,
laden
with
silver
to
the
value
of
two
million
of

:
 
which
dazzle
prize
be

from
Portsmouth
to
London
in
waggon
,
with
the
populace
of
all
the
town
and
village
through
which
the
waggon
pass
,
shout
with
all
their
might
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
victory
,
bold
Admiral
Blake
sail
away
to
the
port
of
Santa
Cruz
to
cut
off
the
spanish
treasure
-
ship
come
from
Mexico
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
find
them
,
ten
in
number
,
with
seven
other
to
take
care
of
them
,
and
a
big
castle
,
and
seven
battery
,
all
roar
and
blaze
away
at
him
with
great
gun
.
 
<EOS>
Blake
care
no
more
for
great
gun
than
for
pop
-
gun
---
no
more
for
their
hot
iron
ball
than
for
snow
-
ball
.
<EOS>
He
dash
into
the
harbour
,
capture
and
burn
every
one
of
the
ship
,
and
come
sail
out
again
triumphantly
,
with
the
victorious
english
flag
flying
at
his
masthead
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
triumph
of
this
great
commander
,
who
have
sail
and
fight
until
he
be
quite
wear
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
die
,
as
his
successful
ship
be
come
into
Plymouth
Harbour
amidst
the
joyful
acclamation
of
the
people
,
and
be
bury
in
state
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
lie
there
,
long
.
  
<EOS>
over
and
above
all
this
,
Oliver
find
that
the
vaudois
,
or
protestant
people
of
the
valley
of
Lucerne
,
be
insolently
treat
by
the
catholic
power
,
and
be
even
put
to
death
for
their
religion
,
in
an
audacious
and
bloody
manner
.
 
<EOS>
instantly
,
he
inform
those
power
that
this
be
a
thing
which
Protestant
England
would
not
allow
;
and
he
speedily
carry
his
point
,
through
the
might
of
his
great
name
,
and
establish
their
right
to
worship
God
in
peace
after
their
own
harmless
manner
.
  
<EOS>
lastly
,
his
english
army
win
such
admiration
in
fighting
with
the
French
against
the
Spaniards
,
that
,
after
they
have
assault
the
town
of
Dunkirk
together
,
the
french
King
in
person
give
it
up
to
the
English
,
that
it
may
be
a
token
to
them
of
their
might
and
valour
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
plot
enough
against
Oliver
among
the
frantic
religionist
(
who
call
themselves
Fifth
Monarchy
Men
)
,
and
among
the
disappointed
Republicans
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
difficult
game
to
play
,
for
the
Royalists
be
always
ready
to
side
with
either
party
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
"
King
over
the
water
,
"
too
,
as
Charles
be
call
,
have
no
scruple
about
plot
with
any
one
against
his
life
;
although
there
be
reason
to
suppose
that
he
would
willingly
have
marry
one
of
his
daughter
,
if
Oliver
would
have
have
such
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
COLONEL
saxby
of
the
army
,
once
a
great
supporter
of
Oliver
's
but
now
turn
against
him
,
who
be
a
grievous
trouble
to
him
through
all
this
part
of
his
career
;
and
who
come
and
go
between
the
discontent
in
England
and
Spain
,
and
Charles
who
put
himself
in
alliance
with
Spain
on
be
throw
off
by
France
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
die
in
prison
at
last
;
but
not
until
there
have
be
very
serious
plot
between
the
Royalists
and
Republicans
,
and
an
actual
rise
of
them
in
England
,
when
they
burst
into
the
city
of
Salisbury
,
on
a
Sunday
night
,
seize
the
judge
who
be
go
to
hold
the
assize
there
next
day
,
and
would
have
hang
them
but
for
the
merciful
objection
of
the
more
temperate
of
their
number
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
be
so
vigorous
and
shrewd
that
he
soon
put
this
revolt
down
,
as
he
do
most
other
conspiracy
;
and
it
be
well
for
one
of
its
chief
manager
---
<EOS>
that
same
Lord
Wilmot
who
have
assist
in
Charles

flight
,
and

Oliver

everywhere
,
and
secure
such
source
of
information
as
his
enemy

Sealed

with
a
basketful

combustible

which
be

<EOS>
He
have
have
this
in

whether
because

that
the
english
people

be
more
used
to
the
title
,
be
more
likely
to
obey
it
;
or
whether
because
he
really
wish
to
be
a
king
himself
,
and
to
leave
the
succession
to
that
title
in
his
family
,
be
far
from
clear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
already
as
high
,
in
England
and
in
all
the
world
,
as
he
would
ever
be
,
and
I
doubt
if
he
care
for
the
mere
name
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
a
paper
,
call
the
"
humble
Petition
and
Advice
,
"
be
present
to
him
by
the
House
of
Commons
,
pray
him
to
take
a
high
title
and
to
appoint
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
would
have
take
the
title
of
King
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
,
but
for
the
strong
opposition
of
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
this
induce
him
to
forbear
,
and
to
assent
only
to
the
other
point
of
the
petition
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
occasion
there
be
another
grand
show
in
Westminster
Hall
,
when
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
formally
invest
him
with
a
purple
robe
line
with
ermine
,
and
present
him
with
a
splendidly
bind
Bible
,
and
put
a
golden
sceptre
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
time
the
Parliament
meet
,
he
call
a
House
of
Lords
of
sixty
member
,
as
the
petition
give
him
power
to
do
;
but
as
that
Parliament
do
not
please
him
either
,
and
would
not
proceed
to
the
business
of
the
country
,
he
jump
into
a
coach
one
morning
,
take
six
guard
with
him
,
and
send
them
to
the
right
-
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
this
have
be
a
warning
to
Parliaments
to
avoid
long
speech
,
and
do
more
work
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
month
of
August
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
eight
,
when
Oliver
Cromwell
's
favourite
daughter
,
ELIZABETH
CLAYPOLE
(
who
have
lately
lose
her
young
son
)
,
lie
very
ill
,
and
his
mind
be
greatly
troubled
,
because
he
love
her
dearly
.
<EOS>
another
of
his
daughter
be
married
to
LORD
FALCONBERG
,
another
to
the
grandson
of
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
and
he
have
make
his
son
RICHARD
one
of
the
member
of
the
Upper
House
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
kind
and
loving
to
them
all
,
be
a
good
father
and
a
good
husband
;
but
he
love
this
daughter
the
good
of
the
family
,
and
go
down
to
Hampton
Court
to
see
her
,
and
could
hardly
be
induce
to
stir
from
her
sick
room
until
she
die
.
 
<EOS>
although
his
religion
have
be
of
a
gloomy
kind
,
his
disposition
have
be
always
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
fond
of
music
in
his
home
,
and
have
keep
open
table
once
a
week
for
all
officer
of
the
army
not
below
the
rank
of
captain
,
and
have
always
preserve
in
his
house
a
quiet
,
sensible
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
encourage
man
of
genius
and
learning
,
and
love
to
have
them
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
MILTON
be
one
of
his
great
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
good
humour
too
,
with
the
nobility
,
whose
dress
and
manner
be
very
different
from
his
;
and
to
show
them
what
good
information
he
have
,
he
would
sometimes
jokingly
tell
them
when
they
be
his
guest
,
where
they
have
last
drunk
the
health
of
the
"
King
over
the
water
,
"
and
would
recommend
them
to
be
more
private
(
if
they
could
)
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
live
in
busy
time
,
have
bear
the
weight
of
heavy
State
affair
,
and
have
often
go
in
fear
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
ill
of
the
gout
and
ague
;
and
when
the
death
of
his
beloved
child
come
upon
him
in
addition
,
he
sink
,
never
to
raise
his
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
his
physician
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
August
that
the
Lord
have
assure
him
that
he
be
not
to
die
in
that
illness
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
get
well
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
only
his
sick
fancy
,
for
on
the
third
of
September
,
which
be
the
anniversary
of
the
great
battle
of
Worcester
,
and
the
day
of
the
year
which
he
call
his
fortunate
day
,
he
die
,
in
the
sixtieth
year
of
his
age
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
delirious
,
and
have
lie
insensible
some
hour
,
but
he
have
be
overhear
to
murmur
a
very
good
prayer
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
the
whole
country
lament
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
want
to
know
the
real
worth
of
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
his
real
service
to
his
country
,
you
can
hardly
do
better
than
compare
England
under
him
,
with
England
under
CHARLES
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
appoint
his
son
Richard
to
succeed
him
,
and
after
there
have
be
,
at
Somerset
House
in
the
Strand
,
a
lying
in
state
more
splendid
than
sensible
---
as
all
such
vanity
after
death
be
,
I
think
---
Richard
become
Lord
Protector
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
amiable
country
gentleman
,
but
have
none
of
his
father
's
great
genius
,
and
be
quite
unfit
for
such
a
post
in
such
a
storm
of
party
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
's
Protectorate
,
which
only
last
a
year
and
a
half
,
be
a
history
of
quarrel
between
the
officer
of
the
army
and
the
Parliament
,
and
between
the
officer
among
themselves
;
and
of
a
grow
discontent
among
the
people
,
who
have
far
too
many
long
sermon
and
far
too
few
amusement
,
and
want
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
General
Monk
get
the
army
well
into
his
own
hand
,
and
then
in
pursuance
of
a
secret
plan
he
seem
to
have
entertain
from
the
time
of
Oliver
's
death
,
declare
for
the
King
's
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
do
this
openly
;
but
,
in
his
place
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
as
one
of
the
member
for
Devonshire
,
strongly
advocate
the
proposal
of
one
SIR
JOHN
GREENVILLE
,
who
come
to
the
House
with
a
letter
from
Charles
,
date
from
Breda
,
and
with
whom
he
have
previously
be
in
secret
communication
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
plot
and
counterplot
,
and
a
recall
of
the
last
member
of
the
Long
Parliament
,
and
an
end
of
the
Long
Parliament
,
and
rising
of
the
Royalists
that
be
make
too
soon
;
and
most
man
be
tired
out
,
and
there
be
no
one
to
head
the
country
<EOS>
now
great
Oliver
be
dead
,
it
be
readily
agree
to
welcome
Charles
Stuart
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
wise
and
well
member
say
---
what
be
most
true
---
that
in
the
letter
from
Breda
,
he
give
no
real
promise
to
govern
well
,
and
that
it
would
be
good
to
make
him
pledge
himself
beforehand
as
to
what
he
should
be
bind
to
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
Monk
say
,
however
,
it
would
be
all
right
when
he
come
,
and
he
could
not
come
too
soon
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
everybody
find
out
all
in
a
moment
that
the
country
MUST
be
prosperous
and
happy
,
have
another
Stuart
to
condescend
to
reign
over
it
;
and
there
be
a
prodigious
firing
off
of
gun
,
lighting
of
bonfire
,
ring
of
bell
,
and
throw
up
of
cap
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
drink
the
King
's
health
by
thousand
in
the
open
street
,
and
everybody
rejoice
.
 
<EOS>
Down
come
the
arm
of
the
Commonwealth
,
up
go
the
Royal
Arms
instead
,
and
out
come
the
public
money
.
 
<EOS>

ten
thousand
pound
for
his
brother
the
Duke
of
York
,
five

<EOS>
prayer

these
gracious
stuart

invite
the
King
home
;
Monk
and
the
kentish
grandee
go
to
Dover
,
to
kneel
down
before
him
as

<EOS>
He
kiss
and
embrace
Monk
,
make
him
ride
in
the
coach
with
himself
and
his
brother
,
come
on
to
London
amid
wonderful
shouting
,
and
pass
through
the
army
at
Blackheath
on
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
May
(
his

<EOS>
on
enter
it

he
commemorate
his
restoration
with
the
joke
that
it
really
would
seem
to
have
be
his
own
fault
that
he
have
not
come
long
ago
,
since
everybody
tell
him
that
he
have
always
wish

him
with

<EOS>
England
under
Charles
the
Second
,
call
the
Merry
Monarch
    
there
never
be
such
profligate
time
in
England
as
under
Charles
the
Second
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
you
see
his
portrait
,
with
his
swarthy
,
ill
-
looking
face
and
great
nose
,
you
may
fancy
him
in
his
Court
at
Whitehall
,
surround
by
some
of
the
very
bad
vagabond
in
the
kingdom
(
though
they
be
lord
and
lady
)
,
drinking
,
gambling
,
indulge
in
vicious
conversation
,
and
commit
every
kind
of
profligate
excess
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
fashion
to
call
Charles
the
Second
"
the
Merry
Monarch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
let
me
try
to
give
you
a
general
idea
of
some
of
the
merry
thing
that
be
do
,
in
the
merry
day
when
this
merry
gentleman
sit
upon
his
merry
throne
,
in
merry
England
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
merry
proceeding
be
---
of
course
---
to
declare
that
he
be
one
of
the
great
,
the
wise
,
and
the
noble
king
that
ever
shine
,
like
the
blessed
sun
itself
,
on
this
benighted
earth
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
merry
and
pleasant
piece
of
business
be
,
for
the
Parliament
,
in
the
humblest
manner
,
to
give
him
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
pound
a
year
,
and
to
settle
upon
him
for
life
that
old
dispute
tonnage
and
poundage
which
have
be
so
bravely
fight
for
.
<EOS>
then
,
General
Monk
be
make
EARL
of
ALBEMARLE
,
and
a
few
other
Royalists
similarly
reward
,
the
law
go
to
work
to
see
what
be
to
be
do
to
those
person
(
they
be
call
Regicides
)
who
have
be
concern
in
make
a
martyr
of
the
late
King
.
 
<EOS>
ten
of
these
be
merrily
execute
;
that
be
to
say
,
six
of
the
judge
,
one
of
the
council
,
Colonel
Hacker
and
another
officer
who
have
command
the
Guards
,
and
HUGH
PETERS
,
a
preacher
who
have
preach
against
the
martyr
with
all
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
these
execution
be
so
extremely
merry
,
that
every
horrible
circumstance
which
Cromwell
have
abandon
be
revive
with
appalling
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
the
heart
of
the
sufferer
be
tear
out
of
their
living
body
;
their
bowel
be
burn
before
their
face
;
the
executioner
cut
joke
to
the
next
victim
,
as
he
rub
his
filthy
hand
together
,
that
be
reek
with
the
blood
of
the
last
;
and
the
head
of
the
dead
be
draw
on
sledge
with
the
living
to
the
place
of
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
even
so
merry
a
monarch
could
not
force
one
of
these
die
man
to
say
that
he
be
sorry
for
what
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
most
memorable
thing
say
among
them
be
,
that
if
the
thing
be
to
do
again
they
would
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Harry
Vane
,
who
have
furnish
the
evidence
against
Strafford
,
and
be
one
of
the
most
staunch
of
the
Republicans
,
be
also
try
,
find
guilty
,
and
order
for
execution
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
upon
the
scaffold
on
Tower
Hill
,
after
conduct
his
own
defence
with
great
power
,
his
note
of
what
he
have
mean
to
say
to
the
people
be
tear
away
from
him
,
and
the
drum
and
trumpet
be
order
to
sound
lustily
and
drown
his
voice
;
for
,
the
people
have
be
so
much
impressed
by
what
the
Regicides
have
calmly
say
with
their
last
breath
,
that
it
be
the
custom
now
,
to
have
the
drum
and
trumpet
always
under
the
scaffold
,
ready
to
strike
up
.
 
<EOS>
Vane
say
no
more
than
this
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
bad
cause
which
can
not
bear
the
word
of
a
die
man
:
"
and
bravely
die
.
  
<EOS>
these
merry
scene
be
succeed
by
another
,
perhaps
even
merry
.
<EOS>
on
the
anniversary
of
the
late
King
's
death
,
the
body
of
Oliver
Cromwell
,
Ireton
,
and
Bradshaw
,
be
tear
out
of
their
grave
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
drag
to
Tyburn
,
hang
there
on
a
gallow
all
day
long
,
and
then
behead
.
 
<EOS>
imagine
the
head
of
Oliver
Cromwell
set
upon
a
pole
to
be
stare
at
by
a
brutal
crowd
,
not
one
of
whom
would
have
dare
to
look
the
live
Oliver
in
the
face
for
half
a
moment
!
 
<EOS>
think
,
after
you
have
read
this
reign
,
what
England
be
under
Oliver
Cromwell
who
be
tear
out
of
his
grave
,
and
what
it
be
under
this
merry
monarch
who
sell
it
,
like
a
merry
Judas
,
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
remain
of
Oliver
's
wife
and
daughter
be
not
to
be
spare
either
,
though
they
have
be
most
excellent
woman
.
 
<EOS>
the
base
clergy
of
that
time
give
up
their
body
,
which
have
be
bury
in
the
Abbey
,
and
---
to
the
eternal
disgrace
of
England
---
they
be
throw
into
a
pit
,
together
with
the
mouldering
bone
of
Pym
and
of
the
brave
and
bold
old
Admiral
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
the
clergy
act
this
disgraceful
part
because
they
hope
to
get
the
nonconformist
,
or
dissenter
,
thoroughly
put
down
in
this
reign
,
and
to
have
but
one
prayer
-
book
and
one
service
for
all
kind
of
people
,
no
matter
what
their
private
opinion
be
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
pretty
well
,
I
think
,
for
a
Protestant
Church
,
which
have
displace
the
Romish
Church
because
people
have
a
right
to
their
own
opinion
in
religious
matter
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
carry
it
with
a
high
hand
,
and
a
prayer
-
book
be
agree
upon
,
in
which
the
extremest
opinion
of
Archbishop
Laud
be
not
forget
.
 
<EOS>
an
Act
be
pass
,
too
,
prevent
any
dissenter
from
hold
any
office
under
any
corporation
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
regular
clergy
in
their
triumph
be
soon
as
merry
as
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
the
army
be
by
this
time
disband
,
and
the
King
crown
,
everything
be
to
go
on
easily
for
evermore
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
a
word
here
about
the
King
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
upon
the
throne
when
his
brother
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
and
his
sister
the
PRINCESS
of
ORANGE
,
die
within
a
few
month
of
each
other
,
of
small
-
pox
.
 
<EOS>
His
remain
sister
,
the
PRINCESS
HENRIETTA
,
marry
the
DUKE
of
ORLEANS
,
the
brother
of
LOUIS
the
FOURTEENTH
,
King
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
JAMES
,
DUKE
of
YORK
,
be
make
High
Admiral
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
become
a
Catholic
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
gloomy
,
sullen
,
bilious
sort
of
man
,
with
a
remarkable
partiality
for
the
ugly
woman
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
marry
,
under
very
discreditable
circumstance
,
ANNE
HYDE
,
the
daughter
of
LORD
CLARENDON
,
then
the
King
's
principal
Minister
---
not
at
all
a
delicate
minister
either
,
but
do
much
of
the
dirty
work
of
a
very
dirty
palace
.
 
<EOS>
It
become
important
now
that
the
King
himself
should
be
marry
;
and
diver
foreign
Monarchs
,
not
very
particular
about
the
character
of
their
son
-
in
-
law
,
propose
their
daughter
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
of
PORTUGAL
offer
his
daughter
,
catherine
of
BRAGANZA
,
and
fifty
thousand
pound
:
 
in
addition
to
which
,
the
french
King
,
who
be
favourable
to
that
match
,
offer
a
loan
of
another
fifty
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
of
Spain
,
on
the
other
hand
,
offer
any
one
out
of
a
dozen
of
princess
,
and
other
hope
of
gain
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
ready
money
carry
the
day
,
and
Catherine
come
over
in
state
to
her
merry
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
court
be
a
great
flaunting
crowd
of
debauch
man
and
shameless
woman
;
and
Catherine
's
merry
husband
insult
and
outrage
her
in
every
possible
way
,
until
she
consent
to
receive
those
worthless
creature
as
her
very
good
friend
,
and
to
degrade
herself
by
their
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
a
MRS
.
PALMER
,
whom
the
King
make
lady
castlemaine
,
and
afterwards
duches
of
CLEVELAND
,
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
bad
woman
about
the
Court
,
and
have
great
influence
with
the
King
nearly
all
through
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
another
merry
lady
name
MOLL
DAVIES
,
a
dancer
at
the
theatre
,
be
afterwards
her
rival
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
NELL
GWYN
,
first
an
orange
girl
and
then
an
actress
,
who
really
have
good
in
her
,
and
of
whom
one
of
the
bad
thing
I
know
be
,
that
actually
she
do
seem
to
have
be
fond
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
DUKE
of
ST
.
<EOS>
ALBANS
be
this
orange
girl
's
child
.
 
<EOS>
in
like
manner
the
son
of
a
merry
waiting
-
lady
,
whom
the
King
create
DUCHESS
of
PORTSMOUTH
,
become
the
DUKE
of
RICHMOND
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
it
be
not
so
bad
a
thing
to
be
a
commoner
.
  
<EOS>
the
Merry
Monarch
be
so
exceedingly
merry
among
these
merry
lady
,
and
some
equally
merry
(
and
equally
infamous
)
lord
and
gentleman
,
that
he
soon
get
through
his
hundred
thousand
pound
,
and
then
,
by
way
of
raise
a
little
pocket
-
money
,
make
a
merry
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
He
sell
Dunkirk
to
the
french
King
for
five
million
of
livre
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
dignity
to
which
Oliver
Cromwell
raise
England
in
the
eye
of
foreign
power
,
and
when
I
think
of
the
manner
in
which
he
gain
for
England
this
very
Dunkirk
,
I
be
much
inclined
to
consider
that
if
the
Merry
Monarch
have
be
make
to
follow
his
father
for
this
action
,
he
would
have
receive
his
just
desert
.
  
<EOS>
though
he
be
like
his
father
in
none
of
that
father
's
great
quality
,
he
be
like
him
in
be
worthy
of
no
trust
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
send
that
letter
to
the
Parliament
,
from
Breda
,
he
do
expressly
promise
that
all
sincere
religious
opinion
should
be
respect
.
<EOS>
yet
he
be
no
sooner
firm
in
his
power
than
he
consent
to
one
of
the
bad
act
of
Parliament
ever
pass
.
 
<EOS>
under
this
law
,
every
minister
who
should
not
give
his
solemn
assent
to
the
Prayer
-
Book
by
a
certain
day
,
be
declare
to
be
a
minister
no
longer
,
and
to
be
deprive
of
his
church
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
be
that
some
two
thousand
honest
man
be
take
from
their
congregation
,
and
reduce
to
dire
poverty
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
follow
by
another
outrageous
law
,
call
the
Conventicle
Act
,
by
which
any
person
above
the
age
of
sixteen
who
be
present
at
any
religious
service
not
accord
to
the
Prayer
-
Book

be

be
imprison
three
month
for
the
first
offence
,
six
for
the
second

and
to

third
.
 
<EOS>
this
Act
alone
fill
the
prison
,
which
be
then
most
dreadful

the

lie

make

<EOS>
but
the
Fire
be
a
great
blessing
to
the
City
afterwards
,
for
it
arise
from
its
ruin
very
much
improve
---
<EOS>
build
more
regularly
,
more
widely
,
more
cleanly
and
carefully
,
and
therefore
much
more
healthily
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
far
more
healthy
than
it
be
,
but
there
be
some
people
in
it
still
---
even
now
<EOS>
,
at
this
time
,
nearly
two
hundred
year
later
---
so
selfish
,
so
pig
-
head
,
and
so
ignorant
,
that
I
doubt
if
even
another
Great
Fire
would
warm
them
up
to
do
their
duty
.
  
<EOS>
the
Catholics
be
accuse
of
have
wilfully
set
London
in
flame
;
one
poor
Frenchman
,
who
have
be
mad
for
year
,
even
accuse
himself
of
have
with
his
own
hand
fire
the
first
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
reasonable
doubt
,
however
,
that
the
fire
be
accidental
.
 
<EOS>
an
inscription
on
the
Monument
long
attribute
it
to
the
Catholics
;
but
it
be
remove
now
,
and
be
always
a
malicious
and
stupid
untruth
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
<EOS>
that
the
Merry
Monarch
may
be
very
merry
indeed
,
in
the
merry
time
when
his
people
be
suffer
under
pestilence
and
fire
,
he
drink
and
gamble
and
fling
away
among
his
favourite
the
money
which
the
Parliament
have
vote
for
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
be
that
the
stout
-
hearted
english
sailor
be
merrily
starve
of
want
,
and
die
in
the
street
;
while
the
Dutch
,
under
their
admiral
DE
WITT
and
DE
RUYTER
,
come
into
the
River
Thames
,
and
up
the
River
Medway
as
far
as
Upnor
,
burn
the
guard
-
ship
,
silence
the
weak
battery
,
and
do
what
they
would
to
the
english
coast
for
six
whole
week
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
english
ship
that
could
have
prevent
them
have
neither
powder
nor
shoot
on
board
;
in
this
merry
reign
,
public
officer
make
themselves
as
merry
as
the
King
do
with
the
public
money
;
and
when
it
be
entrust
to
them
to
spend
in
national
defence
or
preparation
,
they
put
it
into
their
own
pocket
with
the
merry
grace
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Clarendon
have
,
by
this
time
,
run
as
long
a
course
as
be
usually
allot
to
the
unscrupulous
minister
of
bad
king
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
impeach
by
his
political
opponent
,
but
unsuccessfully
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
then
command
him
to
withdraw
from
England
and
retire
to
France
,
which
he
do
,
after
defend
himself
in
writing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
great
loss
at
home
,
and
die
abroad
some
seven
year
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
there
then
come
into
power
a
ministry
call
the
Cabal
Ministry
,
because
it
be
compose
of
LORD
CLIFFORD
,
the
earl
of
ARLINGTON
,
the
DUKE
of
BUCKINGHAM
(
a
great
rascal
,
and
the
King
's
most
powerful
favourite
)
,
LORD
ASHLEY
,
and
the
DUKE
of
LAUDERDALE
,
C*A*B*A*L.
 
<EOS>
as
the
French
be
make
conquest
in
flander
,
the
first
cabal
proceeding
be
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
Dutch
,
for
unite
with
Spain
to
oppose
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
sooner
make
than
the
Merry
Monarch
,
who
always
want
to
get
money
without
be
accountable
to
a
Parliament
for
his
expenditure
,
<EOS>
apologise
to
the
King
of
France
for
have
have
anything
to
do
with
it
,
and
conclude
a
secret
treaty
with
him
,
make
himself
his
infamous
pensioner
to
the
amount
of
two
million
of
livre
down
,
and
three
million
more
a
year
;
and
engage
to
desert
that
very
Spain
,
to
make
war
against
those
very
dutch
,
and
to
declare
himself
a
Catholic
when
a
convenient
time
should
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
this
religious
king
have
lately
be
cry
to
his
catholic
brother
on
the
subject
of
his
strong
desire
to
be
a
Catholic
;
and
now
he
merrily
conclude
this
treasonable
conspiracy
against
the
country
he
govern
,
by
undertake
to
become
one
as
soon
as
he
safely
could
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
of
which
,
though
he
have
have
ten
merry
head
instead
of
one
,
he
richly
deserve
to
lose
them
by
the
headsman
's
axe
.
  
<EOS>
as
his
one
merry
head
may
have
be
far
from
safe
,
if
these
thing
have
be
know
,
they
be
keep
very
quiet
,
and
war
be
declare
by
France
and
England
against
the
Dutch
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
a
very
uncommon
man
,
afterwards
most
important
to
english
history
and
to
the
religion
and
liberty
of
this
land
,
arise
among
them
,
and
for
many
long
year
defeat
the
whole
project
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
WILLIAM
of
NASSAU
,
PRINCE
of
ORANGE
,
son
of
the
last
Prince
of
Orange
of
the
same
name
,
who
marry
the
daughter
of
Charles
the
First
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
at
this
time
,
only
just
of
age
;
but
he
be
brave
,
cool
,
intrepid
,
and
wise
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
have
be
so
detest
that
,
upon
his
death
,
the
Dutch
have
abolish
the
authority
to
which
this
son
would
have
otherwise
succeed
(
Stadtholder
it
be
call
)
,
and
place
the
chief
power
in
the
hand
of
JOHN
DE
WITT
,
who
educate
this
young
prince
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
Prince
become
very
popular
,
and
John
de
Witt
's
brother
CORNELIUS
be
sentence
to
banishment
on
a
false
accusation
of
conspire
to
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
John
go
to
the
prison
where
he
be
,
to
take
him
away
to
exile
,
in
his
coach
;
and
a
great
mob
who
collect
on
the
occasion
,
then
and
there
cruelly
murder
both
the
brother
.
 
<EOS>
this
leave
the
government
in
the
hand
of
the
Prince
,
who
be
really
the
choice
of
the
nation
;
and
from
this
time
he
exercise
it
with
the
great
vigour
,
against
the
whole
power
of
France
,
under
its
famous
general
CONDE
and
TURENNE
,
and
in
support
of
the
protestant
religion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
full
seven
year
before
this
war
end
in
a
treaty
of
peace
make
at
Nimeguen
,
and
its
detail
would
occupy
a
very
considerable
space
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
say
that
William
of
Orange
establish
a
famous
character
with
the
whole
world
;
and
that
the
Merry
Monarch
,
add
to
and
improve
on
his
former
baseness
,
bind
himself
to
do
everything
the
King
of
France
like
,
and
nothing
the
King
of
France
do
not
like
,
for
a
pension
of
one
hundred
thousand
pound
a
year
,
which
be
afterwards
double
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
the
King
of
France
,
by
mean
of
his
corrupt
ambassador
---
who
write
account
of
his
proceeding
in
England
,
which
be
not
always
to
be
believe
,
I
think
---
buy
our
english
member
of
Parliament
,
as
he
want
them
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
in
point
of
fact
,
during
a
considerable
portion
of
this
merry
reign
,
the
King
of
France
be
the
real
king
of
this
country
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
well
time
to
come
,
and
it
be
to
come
(
though
his
royal
uncle
little
thought
so
)
through
that
very
William
,
Prince
of
Orange
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
over
to
England
,
see
Mary
,
the
elder
daughter
of
the
Duke
of
York
,
and
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
by
-
and
-
by
what
come
of
that
marriage
,
and
why
it
be
never
to
be
forget
.
  
<EOS>
this
daughter
be
a
Protestant
,
but
her
mother
die
a
Catholic
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
sister
ANNE
,
also
a
Protestant
,
be
the
only
survivor
of
eight
child
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
afterwards
marry
GEORGE
,
PRINCE
of
DENMARK
,
brother
to
the
King
of
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
lest
you
should
do
the
Merry
Monarch
the
injustice
of
supposing
that
he
be
even
good
humour
(
except
when
he
have
everything
his
own
way
)
,
or
that
he
be
high
spirited
and
honourable
,
I
will
mention
here
what
be
do
to
a
member
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
SIR
JOHN
COVENTRY
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
remark
in
a
debate
about
tax
the
theatre
,
which
give
the
King
offence
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
agree
with
his
illegitimate
son
,
who
have
be
bear
abroad
,
and
whom
he
have
make
DUKE
of
MONMOUTH
,
to
take
the
follow
merry
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
to
waylay
him
at
night
,
fifteen
armed
man
to
one
,
and
to
slit
his
nose
with
a
penknife
.
 
<EOS>
like
master
,
like
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
favourite
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
be
strongly
suspect
of
set
on
an
assassin
to
murder
the
DUKE
OF
ORMOND
as
he
be
return
home
from
a
dinner
;
and
that
Duke
's
spirited
son
,
LORD
OSSORY
,
be
so
persuade
of
his
guilt
,
that
he
say
to
him
at
court
,
<EOS>
even
as
he
stand
beside
the
King
,
"
My
lord
,
I
know
very
well
that
you
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
late
attempt
upon
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
give
you
warn
,
<EOS>
if
he
ever
come
to
a
violent
end
,
his
blood
shall
be
upon
you
,
and
wherever
I
meet
you
I
will
pistol
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
so
,
though
I
find
you
stand
behind
the
King
's
chair
;
and
I
tell
you
this
in
his
Majesty
's
presence
,
that
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
my
do
what
I
threaten
.
"
 
<EOS>
those
be
merry
time
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
fellow
name
blood
,
who
be
seize
for
make
,
with
two
companion
,
an
audacious
attempt
to
steal
the
crown
,
the
globe
,
and
sceptre
,
from
the
place
where
the
jewel
be
keep
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
this
robber
,
who
be
a
swagger
ruffian
,
be
take
,
declare
that
he
be
the
man
who
have
endeavour
to
kill
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
that
he
have
mean
to
kill
the
king
too
,
but
be
overawe
by
the
majesty
of
his
appearance
,
when
he
may
otherwise
have
do
it
,
as
he
be
bathe
at
Battersea
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
be
but
an
ill
-
look
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
be
flatter
,
or
whether
he
know
that
Buckingham
have
really
set
blood
on
to
murder
the
Duke
,
be
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
quite
certain
that
he
pardon
this
thief
,
give
him
an
estate
of
five
hundred
a
year
in
Ireland
(
which
have
have
the
honour
of
give
him
birth
)
,
and
present
him
at
Court
to
the
debauch
lord
and
the
shameless
lady
,
who
make
a
great
deal
of
him
---
as
I
have
no
doubt
they
would
have
make
of
the
Devil
himself
,
if
the
King
have
introduce
him
.
  
<EOS>
infamously
pension
as
he
be
,
the
King
still
want
money
,
and
consequently
be
oblige
to
call
parliament
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
,
the
great
object
of
the
Protestants
be
to
thwart
the
Catholic
Duke
of
York
,
who
marry
a
second
time
;
his
new
wife
be
a
young
lady
only
fifteen
year
old
,
the
catholic
sister
of
the
DUKE
of
MODENA
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
they
be
second
by
the
Protestant
Dissenters
,
though
to
their
own
disadvantage
:
 
since
,
to
exclude
Catholics
from
power
,
they
be
even
willing
to
exclude
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
's
object
be
to
pretend
to
be
a
Protestant
,
while
he
be
really
a
Catholic
;
to
swear
to
the
bishop
that
he
be
devoutly
attach
to
the
English
Church
,
while
he
know
he
have
bargain
it
away
to
the
King
of
France
;
and
by
cheat
and
deceive
them
,
and
all
who
be
attach
to
royalty
,
to
become
despotic
and
be
powerful
enough
to
confess
what
a
rascal
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
,
the
King
of
France
,
know
his
merry
pensioner
well
,
intrigue
with
the
King
's
opponent
in
Parliament
,
as
well
as
with
the
King
and
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
fear
that
the
country
have
of
the
catholic
religion
be
restore
,
if
the
Duke
of
York
should
come
to
the
throne
,
and
the
low
cunning
of
the
King
in
pretend
to
share
their
alarm
,
lead
to
some
very
terrible
result
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
DR
.
<EOS>
TONGE
,
a
dull
clergyman
in
the
City
,
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
certain
TITUS
OATES
,
a
most
infamous
character
,
who
pretend
to
have
acquire
among
the
Jesuits
abroad
a
knowledge
of
a
great
plot
for
the
murder
of
the
King
,
and
the
re
-
establishment
if
the
catholic
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Titus
Oates
,
be
produce
by
this
unlucky
Dr.
Tonge
and
solemnly
examine
before
the
council
,
contradict
himself
in
a
thousand
way
,
tell
the
most
ridiculous
and
improbable
story
,
and
implicate
COLEMAN
,
the
Secretary
of
the
Duchess
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
although
what
he
charge
against
Coleman
be
not
true
,
and
although
you
and
I
know
very
well
that
the
real
dangerous
catholic
plot
be
that
one
with
the
King
of
France
of
which
the
Merry
Monarch
be
himself
the
head
,
there
happen
to
be
find
among
Coleman
's
paper
,
some
letter
,
in
which
he
do
praise
the
day
of
Bloody
Queen
Mary
,
and
abuse
the
protestant
religion
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
great
good
fortune
for
Titus
,
as
it
seem
to
confirm
him
;
but
well
still
be
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
SIR
EDMUNDBURY
GODFREY
,
the
magistrate
who
have
first
examine
him
,
be
unexpectedly
find
dead
near
Primrose
Hill
,
be
confidently
believe
to
have
be
kill
by
the
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
have
be
melancholy
mad
,
and
that
he
kill
himself
;
but
he
have
a
great
protestant
funeral
,
and
Titus
be
call
the
Saver
of
the
nation
,
and
receive
a
pension
of
twelve
hundred
pound
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Oates
's
wickedness
have
meet
with
this
success
,
up
start
another
villain
,
name
WILLIAM
BEDLOE
,
who
,
attract
by
a
reward
of
five
hundred
pound
offer
for
the
apprehension
of
the
murderer
of
Godfrey
,
come
forward
and
charge
two
Jesuits
and
some
other
person
with
have
commit
it
at
the
Queen
's
desire
.
<EOS>
oate
,
go
into
partnership
with
this
new
informer
,
have
the
audacity
to
accuse
the
poor
Queen
herself
of
high
treason
.
 
<EOS>
then
appear
a
third
informer
,
as
bad
as
either
of
the
two
,
and
accuse
a
catholic

<EOS>
the

so
full
of

<EOS>
to

sufficient
idea
of
the
misery
of
Scotland
in
this
merry

would
occupy

because
the

<EOS>
a
body
of
ferocious
highlander
,
turn
upon
them
from
the
mountain
of
their
own

,
have
no
great
effect

he

upon

Heaven

<EOS>
if
ever
a
man
deserve
such
a
death
,
I
think
Archbishop
Sharp
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
make
a
great
noise
directly
,
and
the
Merry
Monarch
---
strongly
suspect
of
have
goad
the
scottish
people
on
,
that
he
may
have
an
excuse
for
a
great
army
than
the
Parliament
be
willing
to
give
him
---
send
down
his
son
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
as
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
with
instruction
to
attack
the
scottish
rebel
,
or
Whigs
as
they
be
call
,
whenever
he
come
up
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
march
with
ten
thousand
man
from
Edinburgh
,
he
find
them
,
in
number
four
or
five
thousand
,
draw
up
at
Bothwell
Bridge
,
by
the
Clyde
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
soon
disperse
;
and
Monmouth
show
a
more
humane
character
towards
them
,
than
he
have
show
towards
that
Member
of
Parliament
whose
nose
he
have
cause
to
be
slit
with
a
penknife
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
of
Lauderdale
be
their
bitter
foe
,
and
send
Claverhouse
to
finish
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
Duke
of
York
become
more
and
more
unpopular
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
become
more
and
more
popular
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
decent
in
the
latter
not
to
have
vote
in
favour
of
the
renew
bill
for
the
exclusion
of
James
from
the
throne
;
but
he
do
so
,
much
to
the
King
's
amusement
,
who
use
to
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
by
the
fire
,
hear
the
debate
,
which
he
say
be
as
good
as
a
play
.
<EOS>
the
House
of
Commons
pass
the
bill
by
a
large
majority
,
and
it
be
carry
up
to
the
House
of
Lords
by
LORD
RUSSELL
,
one
of
the
good
of
the
leader
on
the
protestant
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
reject
there
,
chiefly
because
the
bishop
help
the
King
to
get
rid
of
it
;
and
the
fear
of
catholic
plot
revive
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
another
get
up
,
by
a
fellow
out
of
Newgate
,
name
DANGERFIELD
,
which
be
more
famous
than
it
deserve
to
be
,
under
the
name
of
the
MEAL
-
TUB
PLOT
.
 
<EOS>
this
jail
-
bird
have
be
get
out
of
Newgate
by
a
MRS
.
CELLIER
,
a
catholic
nurse
,
have
turn
Catholic
himself
,
and
pretend
that
he
know
of
a
plot
among
the
Presbyterians
against
the
King
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
pleasant
to
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
hate
the
Presbyterians
,
who
return
the
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
Dangerfield
twenty
guinea
,
and
send
him
to
the
King
his
brother
.
<EOS>
but
Dangerfield
,
break
down
altogether
in
his
charge
,
and
be
send
back
to
Newgate
,
almost
astonish
the
Duke
out
of
his
five
sense
by
suddenly
swear
that
the
catholic
nurse
have
put
that
false
design
into
his
head
,
and
that
what
he
really
know
about
,
be
,
a
catholic
plot
against
the
King
;
the
evidence
of
which
would
be
find
in
some
paper
,
conceal
in
a
meal
-
tub
in
Mrs
Cellier
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
be
,
of
course
---
<EOS>
for
he
have
put
them
there
himself
---
and
so
the
tub
give
the
name
to
the
plot
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
nurse
be
acquit
on
her
trial
,
and
it
come
to
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Ashley
,
of
the
Cabal
,
be
now
Lord
Shaftesbury
,
and
be
strong
against
the
succession
of
the
Duke
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
the
House
of
Commons
,
aggravate
to
the
utmost
extent
,
as
we
may
well
suppose
,
by
suspicion
of
the
King
's
conspiracy
with
the
King
of
France
,
make
a
desperate
point
of
the
exclusion
,
still
,
and
be
bitter
against
the
Catholics
generally
.
 
<EOS>
so
unjustly
bitter
be
they
,
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
,
that
they
impeach
the
venerable
Lord
Stafford
,
a
catholic
nobleman
seventy
year
old
,
of
a
design
to
kill
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
the
witness
be
that
atrocious
Oates
and
two
other
bird
of
the
same
feather
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
find
guilty
,
on
evidence
quite
as
foolish
as
it
be
false
,
and
be
behead
on
Tower
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
be
oppose
to
him
when
he
first
appear
upon
the
scaffold
;
but
,
when
he
have
address
them
and
show
them
how
innocent
he
be
and
how
wickedly
he
be
send
there
,
their
well
nature
be
arouse
,
and
they
say
,
"
We
believe
you
,
my
Lord
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
Lord
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
House
of
Commons
refuse
to
let
the
King
have
any
money
until
he
should
consent
to
the
Exclusion
Bill
;
but
,
as
he
could
get
it
and
do
get
it
from
his
master
the
King
of
France
,
he
could
afford
to
hold
them
very
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
a
Parliament
at
Oxford
,
to
which
he
go
down
with
a
great
show
of
be
arm
and
protect
as
if
he
be
in
danger
of
his
life
,
and
to
which
the
opposition
member
also
go
armed
and
protect
,
allege
that
they
be
in
fear
of
the
Papists
,
who
be
numerous
among
the
King
's
guard
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
go
on
with
the
Exclusion
Bill
,
and
be
so
earnest
upon
it
that
they
would
have
carry
it
again
,
if
the
King
have
not
pop
his
crown
and
state
robe
into
a
sedan
-
chair
,
bundle
himself
into
it
along
with
them
,
hurry
down
to
the
chamber
where
the
House
of
Lords
meet
,
and
dissolve
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
he
scamper
home
,
and
the
member
of
Parliament
scamper
home
too
,
as
fast
as
their
leg
could
carry
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
York
,
then
reside
in
Scotland
,
have
,
under
the
law
which
exclude
Catholics
from
public
trust
,
<EOS>
no
right
whatever
to
public
employment
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
openly
employ
as
the
King
's
representative
in
Scotland
,
and
there
gratify
his
sullen
and
cruel
nature
to
his
heart
's
content
by
direct
the
dreadful
cruelty
against
the
Covenanters
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
minister
name
CARGILL
and
CAMERON
who
have
escape
from
the
battle
of
Bothwell
Bridge
,
and
who
return
to
Scotland
,
and
raise
the
miserable
but
still
brave
and
unsubdued
Covenanters
afresh
,
under
the
name
of
Cameronians
.
 
<EOS>
as
Cameron
publicly
post
a
declaration
that
the
King
be
a
forsworn
tyrant
,
no
mercy
be
show
to
his
unhappy
follower
after
he
be
slay
in
battle
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
be
particularly
fond
of
the
Boot
and
derive
great
pleasure
from
have
it
apply
,
offer
their
life
to
some
of
these
people
,
if
they
would
cry
on
the
scaffold
"
God
save
the
king
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
their
relation
,
friend
,
and
countryman
,
have
be
so
barbarously
torture
and
murder
in
this
merry
reign
,
that
they
prefer
to
die
,
and
do
die
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
then
obtain
his
merry
brother
's
permission
to
hold
a
Parliament
in
Scotland
,
which
first
,
with
most
shameless
deceit
,
confirm
the
law
for
secure
the
protestant
religion
against
Popery
,
and
then
declare
that
nothing
must
or
should
prevent
the
succession
of
the
Popish
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
double
-
faced
beginning
,
it
establish
an
oath
which
no
human
being
could
understand
,
but
<EOS>
which
everybody
be
to
take
,
as
a
proof
that
his
religion
be
the
lawful
religion
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Argyle
,
take
it
with
the
explanation
that
he
do
not
consider
it
to
prevent
him
from
favour
any
alteration
either
in
the
Church
or
State
which
be
not
inconsistent
with
the
protestant
religion
or
with
his
loyalty
,
be
try
for
high
treason
before
a
scottish
jury
of
which
the
MARQUIS
of
MONTROSE
be
foreman
,
and
be
find
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
He
escape
the
scaffold
,
for
that
time
,
by
get
away
,
in
the
disguise
of
a
page
,
in
the
train
of
his
daughter
,
LADY
SOPHIA
lindsay
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
propose
,
by
certain
member
of
the
Scottish
Council
,
that
this
lady
should
be
whip
through
the
street
of
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
too
much
even
for
the
Duke
,
who
have
the
manliness
then
<EOS>
(
he
have
very
little
at
most
time
)
to
remark
that
englishman
be
not
accustom
to
treat
lady
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
in
those
merry
time
nothing
could
equal
the
brutal
servility
of
the
scottish
fawner
,
but
the
conduct
of
similar
degraded
being
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
settlement
of
these
little
affair
,
the
Duke
return
to
England
,
and
soon
resume
his
place
at
the
Council
,
and
his
office
of
High
Admiral
---
all
this
by
his
brother
's
favour
,
and
in
open
defiance
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
no
loss
to
the
country
,
if
he
have
be
drown
when
his
ship
,
in
go
to
Scotland
to
fetch
his
family
,
strike
on
a
sand

bank
,
and
be
lose
with
two
hundred
soul
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
escape
in
a
boat
with
some
friend
;
and
the
sailor
be
so
brave
and
unselfish
,
that
,
when
they
see
him
row
away
,
they
give
three
cheer
,
while
they
themselves
be
go
down
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
the
Merry
Monarch
,
have
get
rid
of
his
Parliament
,
go
to
work
to
make
himself
despotic
,
with
all

<EOS>
have
have
the
villainy
to

the
execution
of
OLIVER

BISHOP
of
ARMAGH
,
falsely
accuse
of
a
plot
to
establish
Popery
in
that
country
by

of
a
french
army

the
very
thing
this
royal
traitor
be
himself
try
to
do
at
home
---
and
have
try
to
ruin
Lord
Shaftesbury
,
and
fail
---
he
turn
his
hand
to
control
the
corporation
all
over
the
country

because
,
if
he
could
only
do
that

he
could
get
what
jury
he
choose

to
bring
in
perjured
verdict

and
could
get
what
member
he
choose
return
to

<EOS>
these
merry

make
Chief
Justice
of
the
Court
of
King

a
drunken
ruffian

horrible

with

any
human
breast

this
monster
be
the
Merry

especial
favourite

he
testify
his
admiration

Him
the

employ
to
go
about

call
it

"
to
give

a
lick
with
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue

<EOS>
and
he
do
it
<EOS>
so
thoroughly

that
they
soon
become
the
base

most
sycophantic
body
in
the
kingdom
---
except
the
University
of
Oxford
,
which
,
in
that
respect

England

a
man
so
very
disagreeable

that
even
the
good
of
historian
have
favour
his
brother
Charles
,
as
become
,
by
comparison
,
quite
a
pleasant
character

<EOS>
the
one
object
of
his
short
reign
be
to
re
-
establish
the
catholic
religion
in
England
;
and
this
he
doggedly
pursue
with
such
a
stupid
obstinacy
,
that
his
career
very
soon
come
to
a
close
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
he
do

be
,
to
assure
his
council
that
he
would
make
it
his
endeavour
to
preserve
the
Government
,
both
in
Church
and
State
,
as
it
be
by
law
establish
;

that
he
would
always
take
care
to
defend
and
support
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
great
public
acclamation
be
raise
over
this
fair
speech

a
great
deal
be
say
,
from
the
pulpit

elsewhere
,
about
the
word
of
a
king
which
be
never
break
,
by
credulous
people
who
little
suppose
that
he
have
form
a
secret
council
for
catholic
affair

of
which
a
mischievous
Jesuit
,
call
FATHER
PETRE

be
one
of
the
chief
member

<EOS>
with
tear
of
joy
in
his
eye
,
he
receive
,
as
the
beginning
of
his
pension
from
the
King
of
France
,
five
hundred
thousand
livre
;
yet
,
with
a
mixture
of
meanness
and
arrogance
that
belong
to
his
contemptible
character
,
he
be
always
jealous
of
make
some
show
of
be
independent
of
the
King
of
France
,
while

pocket
his
money

very
obsequious

grant
him
a
large
sum
of
money

he
begin
his
reign
with
a
belief
that
he
could
do
what
he

with
a
determination

do
it

<EOS>
before

its
principal
event

Titus

He

so
strong

under
the
torture
,
but
live
to
be
afterwards
pardon
and
reward
,
though
not

in
any
more

<EOS>
Dangerfield

the
only
other
one

that
crew
leave
alive

be
not
so
fortunate

<EOS>
He
be
almost
kill
by
a
whipping
from
Newgate
to
Tyburn

and
,
as
if
that
be
not
punishment
enough
,
a
ferocious
barrister
of
Gray

Inn
give
him
a
poke
in
the
eye
with
his
cane

It

him
with
such
vigour
as
to
prevent
his
raise
more
than
two

three
thousand
Highlanders
,
although
he
send
a
fiery
cross
,
by
trusty
messenger
,
from
clan

from
glen

as
the

thoroughly
agree
with
Rumbold
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
partly
through
be
detain
and
partly
through
idle
his
time
away
,
be
five
or
six
week
behind
his
friend
when
he
land
at
Lyme
,
in
Dorset
:
 
have
at
his
right
hand
an
unlucky
nobleman
call
LORD
GREY
of
WERK
,
who
of
himself
would
have
ruin
a
far
more
promising
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
set
up
his
standard
in
the
market
-
place
,
and
proclaim
the
King
a
tyrant
,
and
a
popish
usurper
,
and
I
know
not
what
else
;
charge
him
,
not
only
with
what
he
have
do
,
which
be
bad
enough
,
but
with
what
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
have
do
,
such
as
set
fire
to
London
,
and
poison
the
late
King
.
 
<EOS>
raise
some
four
thousand
man
by
these
mean
,
he
march
on
to
Taunton
,
where
there
be
many
protestant
dissenter
who
be
strongly
opposed
to
the
Catholics
.
<EOS>
here
,
both
the
rich
and
poor
turn
out
to
receive
him
,
lady
wave
a
welcome
to
him
from
all
the
window
as
he
pass
along
the
street
,
flower
be
strew
in
his
way
,
and
every
compliment
and
honour
that
could
be
devise
be
shower
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
twenty
young
lady
come
forward
,
in
their
good
clothe
,
and
in
their
bright
beauty
,
and
give
him
a
Bible
ornament
with
their
own
fair
hand
,
together
with
other
present
.
  
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
homage
,
he
proclaim
himself
King
,
and
go
on
to
Bridgewater
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
here
the
Government
troop
,
under
the
EARL
of
FEVERSHAM
,
be
close
at
hand
;
and
he
be
so
dispirited
at
find
that
he
make
but
few
powerful
friend
after
all
,
that
it
be
a
question
whether
he
should
disband
his
army
and
endeavour
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
resolve
,
at
the
instance
of
that
unlucky
Lord
Grey
,
to
make
a
night
attack
on
the
King
's
army
,
as
it
lie
encamp
on
the
edge
of
a
morass
call
Sedgemoor
.
 
<EOS>
the
horseman
be
command
by
the
same
unlucky
lord
,
who
be
not
a
brave
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
up
the
battle
almost
at
the
first
obstacle
---
which
be
a
deep
drain
;
and
although
the
poor
countryman
,
who
have
turn
out
for
Monmouth
,
fight
bravely
with
scythe
,
pole
,
pitchfork
,
and
such
poor
weapon
as
they
have
,
they
be
soon
disperse
by
the
train
soldier
,
and
flee
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
himself
flee
,
be
not
know
in
the
confusion
;
but
the
unlucky
Lord
Grey
be
take
early
next
day
,
and
then
another
of
the
party
be
take
,
who
confess
that
he
have
part
from
the
Duke
only
four
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
strict
search
be
make
<EOS>
,
he
be
find
disguise
as
a
peasant
,
hide
in
a
ditch
under
fern
and
nettle
,
with
a
few
pea
in
his
pocket
which
he
have
gather
in
the
field
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
other
article
he
have
upon
him
be
a
few
paper
and
little
book
:
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
latter
be
a
strange
jumble
,
in
his
own
writing
,
of
charm
,
song
,
recipe
,
and
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
completely
break
.
 
<EOS>
He
write
a
miserable
letter
to
the
King
,
beseech
and
entreat
to
be
allow
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
take
to
London
,
and
convey
bind
into
the
King
's
presence
,
he
crawl
to
him
on
his
knee
,
and
make
a
most
degrading
exhibition
.
 
<EOS>
as
James
never
forgave
or
relent
towards
anybody
,
he
be
not
likely
to
soften
towards
the
issuer
of
the
Lyme
proclamation
,
so
he
tell
the
suppliant
to
prepare
for
death
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
fifteenth
of
July
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
,
this
unfortunate
favourite
of
the
people
be
bring
out
to
die
on
Tower
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
the
crowd
be
immense
,
and
the
top
of
all
the
house
be
cover
with
gazer
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
his
wife
,
the
daughter
of
the
Duke
of
Buccleuch
,
in
the
Tower
,
and
have
talk
much
of
a
lady
whom
he
love
far
better
---
the
LADY
harriet
WENTWORTH
---
<EOS>
who
be
one
of
the
last
person
he
remember
in
this
life
.
 
<EOS>
before
lay
down
his
head
upon
the
block
he
feel
the
edge
of
the
axe
,
and
tell
the
executioner
that
he
fear
it
be
not
sharp
enough
,
and
that
the
axe
be
not
heavy
enough
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
executioner
reply
that
it
be
of
the
proper
kind
<EOS>
,
the
Duke
say
,
"
I
pray
you
have
a
care
,
and
do
not
use
me
so
awkwardly
as
you
use
my
Lord
Russell
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
executioner
,
make
nervous
by
this
,
and
tremble
,
strike
once
and
merely
gash
him
in
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
raise
his
head
and
look
the
man
reproachfully
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
strike
twice
,
and
then
thrice
,
and
then
throw
down
the
axe
,
and
cry
out
in
a
voice
of
horror
that
he
could
not
finish
that
work
.
<EOS>
the
sheriff
,
however
,
threaten
him
with
what
should
be
do
to
himself
if
he
do
not
,
he
take
it
up
again
and
strike
a
fourth
time
and
a
fifth
time
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
wretched
head
at
last
fall
off
,
and
James
,
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
be
dead
,
in
the
thirty
-
sixth
year
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
He

a
showy
,
graceful
man
,
with
many
popular
quality
,
and
have
find
much
favour
in
the
open
heart
of
the
English

<EOS>
the
atrocity
,
commit
by
the
Government
,
which
follow
this
Monmouth
rebellion
,
form
the
black
and
most
lamentable
page
in
english
history
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
peasant
,
have
be
disperse
with
great
loss
,
and
their
leader
have
be
take
,
one
would
think
that
the
implacable
King
may
have
be
satisfy
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
<EOS>
;
he
let
loose
upon
them
,
among
other
intolerable
monster
,
a
COLONEL
KIRK
,
who
have
serve
against
the
Moors
,
and
whose
soldier

call
by
the
people
Kirk
's
lamb
,
because
they
bear
a
lamb
upon
their
flag
,
as
the
emblem
of
Christianity
---
be
worthy
of
their
leader
.
 
<EOS>
the
atrocity
commit
by
these
demon
in
human
shape
be
far
too
horrible
to
be
relate
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
say
,
that
besides
most
ruthlessly
murder
and
rob
them
,
and
ruin
them
by
make
them
buy
their
pardon
at
the
price
of
all
they
possess
,
it
be
one
of
Kirk
's
favourite
amusement
,
as
he
and
his
officer
sit
drink
after
dinner
,
and
toast
the
King
,
to
have
batch
of
prisoner
hang
outside
the
window
for
the
company
's
diversion
;
and
that
when
their
foot
quiver
in
the
convulsion
of
death
,
he
use
to
swear
that
they
should
have
music
to
their
dancing
,
and
would
order
the
drum
to
beat
and
the
trumpet
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
the
detestable
King
inform
him
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
these
service
,
that
he
be
"
very
well
satisfied
with
his
proceeding
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
King
's
great
delight
be
in
the
proceeding
of
Jeffreys
,
now
a
peer
,
who
go
down
into
the
west
,
with
four
other
judge
,
to
try
person
accuse
of
have
have
any
share
in
the
rebellion
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
pleasantly
call
this
"
Jeffreys
's
campaign
.
<EOS>
"
the
people
down
in
that
part
of
the
country
remember
it
to
this
day
as
the
Bloody
Assize
.
  
<EOS>
It
begin
at
Winchester
,
where
a
poor
deaf
old
lady
,
MRS
.
<EOS>
ALICIA
LISLE
,
the
widow
of
one
of
the
judge
of
Charles
the
first
(
who
have
be
murder
abroad
by
some
Royalist
assassin
)
,
be
charge
with
have
give
shelter
in
her
house
to
two
fugitive

Sedgemoor
.
<EOS>
three
time
the
jury
refuse
to
find
her
guilty
,
until
jeffrey
bully
and
frighten
them
into
that
false
verdict
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
extort
it
from
them
,
he
say
,
"
Gentlemen
,
if
I
have
be
one
of
you
,
and
she
have
be
my
own
mother
,
I
would
have
find
her
guilty
;
"
---
as
I
dare
say
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
He
sentence
her
to
be
burn
alive
,
that
very
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
the
clergy
of
the
cathedral
and
some
other
interfere
in
her
favour
,
and
she
be
behead
within
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
high
mark
of
his
approbation
,
the
King
make
Jeffreys
Lord
Chancellor
;
and
he
then
go
on
to
Dorchester
,
to
Exeter
,
to
Taunton
,
and
to
Wells
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
,
when
we
read
of
the
enormous
injustice
and
barbarity
of
this
beast
,
to
know
that
no
one
strike
him
dead
on
the
judgment
-
seat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
any
man
or
woman
to
be
accuse
by
an
enemy
,
before
Jeffreys
,
to
be
find
guilty
of
high
treason
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
who
plead
not
guilty
,
he
order
to
be
take
out
of
court
upon
the
instant
,
and
hang
;
and
this
so
terrify
the
prisoner
in
general
that
they
mostly
plead
guilty
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
at
Dorchester

,
in

course
of
a

<EOS>
the
sight
and
smell
of

,
the
hiss
and
bubbling
of

<EOS>
You

great
French
Revolution
.
 
<EOS>
many
and
terrible
they

but
I
know
of
nothing
bad

do
by
the
madden
people

when

resolve

<EOS>
the

then
he
proceed

but
to
what
be
,
in
fact
,
his
last
plunge
head
-
foremost
in
his
tumble
off

.
  
<EOS>
He
have
issue
a
declaration
that
there
should
be
no
religious
test
or
penal
law
,
in
order
to
let

the
protestant
dissenter
,
unmindful
of
themselves
,
have
gallantly
join
the
regular
church
in
oppose
it
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
and
Father
Petre
now
resolve
to
have
this
read
,
on
a
certain
Sunday
,
in
all
the
church
,
and
to
order
it
to
be
circulate
for
that
purpose
by
the
bishop
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
take
counsel
with
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
who
be
in
disgrace
;
and
they
resolve
that
the
declaration
should
not
be
read
,
and
that
they
would
petition
the
king
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
himself
write
out
the
petition
,
and
six
bishop
go
into
the
King
's
bedchamber
the
same
night
to
present
it
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
be
the
Sunday
fix
for
the
reading
,
and
it
be
only
read
by
two
hundred
clergyman
out
of
ten
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
the
King
resolve
against
all
advice
to
prosecute
the
bishop
in
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
,
and
within
three
week
they
be
summon
before
the
Privy
Council
,
and
commit
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
six
bishop
be
take
to
that
dismal
place
,
by
water
,
the
people
who
be
assemble
in
immense
number
fall
upon
their
knee
,
and
weep
for
them
,
and
pray
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
get
to
the
Tower
,
the
officer
and
soldier
on
guard
besought
them
for
their
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
while
they
be
confine
there
,
the
soldier
every
day
drink
to
their
release
with
loud
shout
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
bring
up
to
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
for
their
trial
,
which
the
Attorney
-
General
say
be
for
the
high
offence
of
censure
the
Government
,
and
give
their
opinion
about
affair
of
state
,
they
be
attend
by
similar
multitude
,
and
surround
by
a
throng
of
nobleman
and
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
jury
go
out
at
seven
o'clock
at
night
to
consider
of
their
verdict
,
everybody
(
except
the
King
)
know
that
they
would
rather
starve
than
yield
to
the
King
's
brewer
,
who
be
one
of
them
,
and
want
a
verdict
for
his
customer
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
into
court
next
morning
,
after
resist
the
brewer
all
night
,
and
give
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
,
such
a
shout
rise
up
in
Westminster
Hall
as
it
have
never
hear
before
;
and
it
be
pass
on
among
the
people
away
to
Temple
Bar
,
and
away
again
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
pass
only
to
the
east
,
but
pass
to
the
west
too
,
until
it
reach
the
camp
at
Hounslow
,
where
the
fifteen
thousand
soldier
take
it
up
and
echo
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
still
,
when
the
dull
King
,
who
be
then
with
Lord
Feversham
,
hear
the
mighty
roar
,
ask
in
alarm
what
it
be
,
and
be
tell
that
it
be
"
nothing
but
the
acquittal
of
the
bishop
,
"
he
say
,
in
his
dogged
way
,
"
call
you
that
nothing
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
much
the
bad
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
between
the
petition
and
the
trial
,
the
Queen
have
give
birth
to
a
son
,
which
Father
Petre
rather
think
be
owe
to
Saint
Winifred
.
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
if
Saint
Winifred
have
much
to
do
with
it
as
the
King
's
friend
,
inasmuch
as
the
entirely
new
prospect
of
a
catholic
successor
(
for
both
the
King
's
daughter
be
Protestants
)
determine
the
EARLS
of
SHREWSBURY
,
DANBY
,
and
DEVONSHIRE
,
LORD
LUMLEY
,
the
BISHOP
of
LONDON
,
admiral
RUSSELL
,
and
COLONEL
SIDNEY
,
to
invite
the
Prince
of
Orange
over
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
Royal
Mole
,
see
his
danger
at
last
,
make
,
in
his
fright
,
many
great
concession
,
besides
raise
an
army
of
forty
thousand
man
;
but
the
Prince
of
Orange
be
not
a
man
for
James
the
Second
to
cope
with
.
<EOS>
His
preparation
be
extraordinarily
vigorous
,
and
his
mind
be
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
fortnight
after
the
Prince
be
ready
to
sail
for
England
,
<EOS>
a
great
wind
from
the
west
prevent
the
departure
of
his
fleet
.
<EOS>
even
when
the
wind
lull
,
and
it
do
sail
,
it
be
disperse
by
a
storm
,
and
be
oblige
to
put
back
to
refit
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
on
the
first
of
November
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
,
the
Protestant
east
wind
,
as
it
be
long
call
,
begin
to
blow
;
and
on
the
third
,
the
people
of
Dover
and
the
people
of
Calais
see
a
fleet
twenty
mile
long
sailing
gallantly
by
,
between
the
two
place
.
 
<EOS>
on
Monday
,
the
fifth
,
it
anchor
at
Torbay
in
Devonshire
,
and
the
Prince
,
with
a
splendid
retinue
of
officer
and
man
,
march
into
Exeter
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
people
in
that
western
part
of
the
country
have
suffer
so
much
in
the
Bloody
Assize
,
that
they
have
lose
heart
.
<EOS>
few
people
join
him
;
and
he
begin
to
think
of
return
,
and
publish
the
invitation
he
have
receive
from
those
lord
,
as
his
justification
for
have
come
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
crisis
,
some
of
the
gentry
join
him
;
the
royal
army
begin
to
falter
;
an
engagement
be
sign
,
by
which
all
who
set
their
hand
to
it
declare
that
they
would
support
one
another
in
defence
of
the
law
and
liberty
of
the
three
Kingdoms
,
of
the
protestant
religion
,
and
of
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
the
cause
receive
no
check
;
the
great
town
in
England
begin
,
one
after
another
,
to
declare
for
the
Prince
;
and
he
know
that
it
be
all
safe
with
him
when
the
University
of
Oxford
offer
to
melt
down
its
plate
,
if
he
want
any
money
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
King
be
run
about
in
a
pitiable
way
,
touch
people
for
the
King
's
evil
in
one
place
,
review
his
troop
in
another
,
and
bleed
from
the
nose
in
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
Prince
be
send
to
Portsmouth
,
Father
Petre
go
off
like
a
shot
to
France
,
and
there
be
a
general
and
swift
dispersal
of
all
the
priest
and
friar
.
 
<EOS>
one
after
another
,
the
King
's
most
important
officer
and
friend
desert
him
and
go
over
to
the
Prince
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
night
,
his
daughter
Anne
flee
from
Whitehall
Palace
;
and
the
Bishop
of
London
,
who
have
once
be
a
soldier
,
ride
before
her
with
a
draw
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
pistol
at
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
help
me
,
"
cry
the
miserable
king
:
 
<EOS>
"
my
very
child
have
forsake
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
in
his
wildness
,
after
debate
with
such
lord
as
be
in
London
,
whether
he
should
or
should
not
call
a
Parliament
,
and
after
name
three
of
them
to
negotiate
with
the
Prince
,
he
resolve
to
fly
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
the
little
Prince
of
Wales
bring
back
from
Portsmouth
;
and
the
child
and
the
Queen
cross
the
river
to
Lambeth
in
an
open
boat
,
on
a
miserable
wet
night
,
and
get
safely
away
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
on
the
night
of
the
ninth
of
December
.
  
<EOS>
at
one
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
eleventh
,
the
King
,
who
have
,
in
the
meantime
,
receive
a
letter
from
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
state
his
object
,
get
out
of
bed
,
tell
LORD
NORTHUMBERLAND
who
lie
in
his
room
not
to
open
the
door
until
the
usual
hour
in
the
morning
,
and
go
down
the
back
stair
(
the
same
,
I
suppose
,
by
which
the
priest
in
the
wig
and
gown
have
come
up
to
his
brother
)
and
cross
the
river
in
a
small
boat
:
 
sink
the
great
seal
of
England
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
horse
have
be
provide
,
he
ride
,
accompany
by
SIR
EDWARD
HALES
,
to
Feversham
,
where
he
embark
in
a
Custom
House
Hoy
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
of
this
Hoy
,
want
more
ballast
,
run
into
the
Isle
of
Sheppy
to
get
it
,
where
the
fisherman
and
smuggler
crowd
about
the
boat
,
and
inform
the
King
of
their
suspicion
that
he
be
a
"
hatchet
-
faced
Jesuit
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
they
take
his
money
and
would
not
let
him
go
,
he
tell
them
who
he
be
,
and
that
the
Prince
of
Orange
want
to
take
his
life
;
and
he
begin
to
scream
for
a
boat
---
and
then
to
cry
,
because
he
have
lose
a
piece
of
wood
on
his
ride
which
he
call
a
fragment
of
Our
Saviour
's
cross
.
<EOS>
He
put
himself
into
the
hand
of
the
Lord
Lieutenant
of
the
county
,
and
his
detention
be
make
known
to
the
Prince
of
Orange
at
Windsor
---
who
,
only
want
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
not
care
where
he
go
,
so
that
he
go
away
,
be
very
much
disconcert
that
they
do
not
let
him
go
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
have
him
bring
back
,
with
some
state
in
the
way
of
Life
Guards
,
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
he
get
there
,
in
his
infatuation
,
he
hear
mass
,
and
set
a
Jesuit
to
say
grace
at
his
public
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
have
be
throw
into
the
strange
state
of
confusion
by
his
flight
,
and
have
take
it
into
their
head
that
the
irish
part
of
the
army
be
go
to
murder
the
Protestants
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
they
set
the
bell
a
ringing
,
and
light
watch
-
fire
,
and
burn
Catholic
Chapels
,
and
look
about
in
all
direction
for
Father
Petre
and
the
Jesuits
,
while
the
Pope
's
ambassador
be
run
away
in
the
dress
of
a
footman
.
 
<EOS>
They
find
no
Jesuits
;
but
a
man
,
who
have
once
be
a
frightened
witness
before
Jeffreys
in
court
,
see
a
swollen
,
drunken
face
look
through
a
window
down
at
wapping
,
which
he
well
remember
.
 
<EOS>
the
face
be
in
a
sailor
's
dress
,
but
he
know
it
to
be
the
face
of
that
accurse
judge
,
and
he
seize
him
.
<EOS>
the
people
,
to
their
lasting
honour
,
do
not
tear
him
to
piece
.
<EOS>
after
knock
him
about
a
little
,
they
take
him
,
in
the
base
agony
of
terror
,
to
the
Lord
Mayor
,
who
send
him
,
at
his
own
shrieking
petition
,
to
the
Tower
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
he
die
.
  
<EOS>
Their
bewilderment
continue
,
the
people
now
light
bonfire
and
make
rejoicing
,
as
if
they
have
any
reason
to
be
glad
to
have
the
King
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
his
stay
be
very
short
,
for
the
english
guard
be
remove
from
Whitehall
<EOS>
,
dutch
guard
be
march
up
to
it
,
and
he
be
tell
by
one
of
his
late
minister
that
the
Prince
would
enter
London
,
next
day
,
and
he
have
better
go
to
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
Ham
be
a
cold
,
damp
place
,
and
he
would
rather
go
to
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
himself
very
cunning
in
this
,
as
he
mean
to
escape
from
Rochester
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Orange
and
his
friend
know
that
,
perfectly
well
,
and
desire
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
go
to
Gravesend

and

<EOS>
some
infatuate
people
in
England
,
and
particularly
in
Scotland
,
take
up
the
Pretender
's
cause
from
time
to

---
as
if
the
country
have
not
have
Stuarts

!
---
and
many
life
be
sacrifice
,
and
much
misery
be
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
King
William
die
on
Sunday
,
the
seventh
of
March
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
two
,
of
the
consequence
of
an
accident
occasion
by
his
horse
stumble
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
a
brave
,
patriotic
Prince
,
and
a
man
of
remarkable
ability
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
be
cold
,
and
he
make
but
few
friend
;
but
he
have
truly
love
his
queen
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
dead
,
a
lock
of
her
hair
,
in
a
ring
,
be
find
tie
with
a
black
ribbon
round
his
left
arm
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
succeed
by
the
PRINCESS
ANNE
,
a
popular
Queen
,
who
reign
twelve
year
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
reign
,
in
the
month
of
May
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seven
,
the
Union
between
England
and
Scotland
be
effect
,
and
the
two
country
be
incorporate
under
the
name
of
GREAT
BRITAIN
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
from
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fourteen
to
the
year
one
thousand
,
eight
hundred
and
thirty
,
reign
the
four
GEORGES
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
reign
of
George
the
Second
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
five
,
that
the
Pretender
do
his
last
mischief
,
and
make
his
last
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
be
an
old
man
by
that
time
,
he
and
the
Jacobites
---
as
his
friend
be
call
---
put
forward
his
son
,
CHARLES
EDWARD
,
know
as
the
young
Chevalier
.
 
<EOS>
the
Highlanders
of
Scotland
,
an
extremely
troublesome
and
wrong
-
head
race
on
the
subject
of
the
Stuarts
,
espouse
his
cause
,
and
he
join
them
,
and
there
be
a
scottish
rebellion
to
make
him
king
,
in
which
many
gallant
and
devoted
gentleman
lose
their
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
hard
matter
for
Charles
Edward
to
escape
abroad
again
,
with
a
high
price
on
his
head
;
but
the
scottish
people
be
extraordinarily
faithful
to
him
,
and
,
after
undergo
many
romantic
adventure
,
not
unlike
those
of
Charles
the
second
,
he
escape
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
a
number
of
charming
story
and
delightful
song
arise
out
of
the
Jacobite
feeling
,
and
belong
to
the
Jacobite
time
.
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
think
the
Stuarts
be
a
public
nuisance
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
reign
of
George
the
Third
that
England
lose
North
America
,
by
persist
in
tax
her
without
her
own
consent
.
 
<EOS>
that
immense
country
,
make
independent
under
WASHINGTON
,
and
leave
to
itself
,
become
the
United
States
;
one
of
the
great
nation
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
time
in
which
I
write
,
it
be
honourably
remarkable
for
protect
its
subject
,
wherever
they
may
travel
,
with
a
dignity
and
a
determination
which
be
a
model
for
England
.
<EOS>
between
you
and
me
,
England
have
rather
lose
ground
in
this
respect
since
the
day
of
Oliver
Cromwell
.
  
<EOS>
the
Union
of
Great
Britain
with
Ireland
---
which
have
be
get
on
very
ill
by
itself
---
take
place
in
the
reign
of
George
the
Third
,
on
the
second
of
July
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
-
eight
.
  
<EOS>
WILLIAM
the
FOURTH

George
the
Fourth

<EOS>
QUEEN
VICTORIA
,
his

,
the
only

the
Duke
of
Kent
,
the
fourth
son
of
George
the
Third
